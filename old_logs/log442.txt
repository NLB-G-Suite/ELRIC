<Ninjazz> I was just too tired.

<Shizuka> 13i thought you were going to be val
<ValtheJean> 2,14 there is only one way to make me truly angry at people, and no one in this chat has done so
<Ninjazz> Hugs, Val?
<MahBoi777> yet
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and Super:.....ung... *facepalm*
<panda> ValtheJean: its not insult caramel is it?
<panda> not saying that I would
<ValtheJean> 2,14 if that were the requisite, then half the channel would be banned
<Ninjazz> Well, there really is no reason to insult Caramel.
<Shizuka> 13http://screensnapr.com/v/2hc0S5.png dat illegible text
*DeathStar sticks to what she knows dosen't upset ValtheJean
<MaidSurge> ValtheJean, I picked the first Super Robot Wars and I like it :D
<Ninjazz> What has Caramel done to incure hate?
<panda> Shizuka: hehe
<panda> Ninjazz: nothing, I just asked lol
<Polydunami> You kidding? I could see *facepalm* clearly on my screen :S
<Kosoveon> night all
<Ninjazz> Exactly.
<MaidSurge> Ninjazz: ikr, he's just a background pony
<panda> Ninjazz: ok look... read clop fic and fall asleep, and dream abotu fav pony lol XD
<Polydunami> Caramel had lines, though
<panda> Polydunami: shh....
<BlueFlare> 02so I should buy it even though it's a PC game? derp
<Ninjazz> Who could hate Caramel? I mean you don't have to adore him. But hate?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL BUYING GAMES
<Shizuka> 13oh joy.... high of 93 tomorrow...
<Polydunami> What? I mean lines of dialogue
<Shizuka> 13summer is here
<MahBoi777> I don't hate
<panda> Shizuka: where?
<Shizuka> 13here
<Midnight_Tempest> i would like to see Val's anger as a form of sociological experiment...
<mario_pony> panda: wait what?
<MaidSurge> Shizuka: you don't like heat, do you?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no you wouldn't
<SuperBrony64> 11,02SUMMER IS HERE, POST WINTER
<Shizuka> 13humidity will be 50% or higher
<Master_Chief> summer was here 2 weeks ago
<mario_pony> panda: why shhh?
<Ninjazz> Val smash?
<Shizuka> 13you can't cool off in that kind of air
<DeathStar> Shizuka: darn nothern hemisphere being all summery
<Aurora> uh
<panda> mario_pony: lmao! Ninjazz said I was lucky
<Midnight_Tempest> oh, i wouldnt want to be the subject Val... i would get someone else for that
<Aurora> well I love it
<Aurora> but just a heads up, it is 60 bucks
<MahBoi777> BRING IT ON HEAT
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it doesn't matter
<BlueFlare> 02okay drf, tell me of you can find a RMG for free :P
<Ninjazz> panda: Very lucky... :|
<panda> wait what? mario_pony, i dont want val to give him the hammer
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you wouldn't want to see it
<Polydunami> Vancouver has had sun for almost a week straight now
<Phase4> high humidity
<drfsupercenter> 03RMG?
*Phase4 hates that
<Ninjazz> If anything like Sumica rage, probably not.
<panda> Ninjazz, no... im telling you, just read a CF and fall asleep, im sure your dreams will be of pony.
<Shizuka> 13this house has no ventilation... once it gets hot, it stays hot
*DeathStar shivers in the cold of the southern hemisphere
<panda> Ninjazz: or, think about wreks drawing from earlier
<BlueFlare> 02Rights managed
<Midnight_Tempest> i miss high humidity... its always so dry...
<Shizuka> 13and we don't have the financial stability right now to afford putting the ACs in
<mario_pony> :O
<MahBoi777> that sucks Shizuka
<drfsupercenter> 03EW DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT
*panda hugs DeathStar till she is warm
<Master_Chief> we dont technically have summer here.....its the rain season
<Polydunami> Our furnace is breaking down... :S
<drfsupercenter> 03That's the whole point of pirating it, you *DON'T* have to deal with that cra
<drfsupercenter> 03p
<Phase4> oh wow
<DeathStar> panda: oh you
<Shizuka> 13i'd prefer rain
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Summer is the time when we are closest to the sun, about 10 feet above its surface. Turns out eating your vegetables keeps us from burning up.
<Ninjazz> panda: Its just not that easy, my friend. Something keeps me from falling asleep and dreaming easily.
<panda> Shizuka: well, sounds like a reason to run around in shirts and shortss and just imto random pools ^^
<MahBoi777> ewwwwww vegetables
<Aurora> daaaang this game is gonna be long
<Aurora> thank god
<Shizuka> 13yeah we don't have any around here
<panda> MahBoi777: carrots are awesome!
<Aurora> love long games
<Polydunami> Eat your veggies or I will vapourise into thin air
<Phase4> Shizuka, :(
<panda> Shizuka: make one?
<Shizuka> 13nearest pool is 10 miles away i believe
<mario_pony> SuperBrony64: still not a good enough reason
<MahBoi777> vegetables, mah only weakness
<MahBoi777> ugh
<panda> Shizuka: geebus, where the hell do you live?
<Midnight_Tempest> i live in the basement so hot weather doesnt effect me
<Shizuka> 13northern twin cities minnesota
<Polydunami> Actually, I enjoy veggies :3
<Ninjazz> I live on an Island, the beach is always 15 minutes away.
<BlueFlare> 02same Aurora
*Phase4 googles minnesota
<BlueFlare> 02seems like my kind of game
<Master_Chief> who had been in zero gravity
<mario_pony> the only vegetable i will eat is cucumbers with lemon and salt
<panda> Shizuka, ok would it creep you out that I may be transfering there?
<Polydunami> Shizuka: How about nearest thousand lakes? :3
<DeathStar> MahBoi777: eating greens is a speacial treet they make long ears and grate big feet
<Aurora> I don't think there's a beta open for trial anymore
<mario_pony> lol
<mario_pony> xD
<Aurora> otherwise I'd say try it
<MahBoi777> Lol good one DeathStar
<Shizuka> 13hell is pretty accurate... upper 90s and godawful humid in summer, -10s to -20s in winter
<DeathStar> MahBoi777: it's just a bambi quote is all
<Phase4> oh wow, your not too far from deserts
<Hogia|Animation> 12I've got Minecraft now :D
<Polydunami> Bambi is a neat movie
<drfsupercenter> 03wait about a week and I'm sure someone will crack the DRM
<Ninjazz> Never seen it.
<Shane377> DeathStar: whatd u say
<MahBoi777> haven't seen bambi in forever
<MaidSurge> ValtheJean, are the "main" characters still the original generation ones?
<Midnight_Tempest> spoiler: Bambi's mom dies
<panda> Shizuka, disregarded mah question xD
<Phase4> Midnight_Tempest, :<
<Shizuka> 13the badlands is probably why so few good storms get here
<Polydunami> Spoiler: Bambi is male
<mario_pony> Midnight_Tempest: hahaha
<Ninjazz> Midnight_Tempest: Time for some venison.
<DeathStar> Shane377: scroll up it's too long for me to be bothers typeing it
<Midnight_Tempest> mmm... venison
<MahBoi777> I HATE hot weather
<Shizuka> 13so need to move back to illinois... the politics are crap but at least i can handle small towns and their weather
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the main characters are always OG
<MaidSurge> Kthx!
<Shane377> meh 2 far DeathStar
<panda> oh gosh, illinois?
<BlueFlare> 02drf, I've payed for every game I have and I'm not going to start not paying for them now
<BlueFlare> 02paid*
<Shizuka> 13grew up in normal
<Shane377> panda: u gotta stop hugging DeathStar she might get the wrong idea
<Ninjazz> So, you're German but live in USA? I am short minded it seems.
<Shizuka> 13before moving to phoenix, then up here
<drfsupercenter> 03<BlueFlare> okay drf, tell me of you can find a RMG for free :P <- well you asked..
<panda> Shane377: O///o
<OtakuTom> I went to school in Normal, Shizu
<Phase4> the weather is generaly better where i am, but melbourne weather is like pinkie pie
<panda> Shizuka: you've been around huh?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's more the *concept* I refuse to pay for. I'm more than happy to buy games that don't restrict what you can do with them
*Midnight_Tempest sneaks up on DeathStar and glomps her
<suckmydick> wow
<MaidSurge> Sudden gainaxing
<drfsupercenter> 03but games like Diablo 3, if your internet connection goes down or if THEIR SERVERS go down, you get kicked off
<suckmydick> this is hot
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<panda> jiggle again XD
<DeathStar> Midnight_Tempest: you so sneeky
<Shane377> som one kick him
<Polydunami> I've only ever lived in Vancouver, although I have family all over the world
<Phase4> dat nick
<BlueFlare> 02well, I didn't anyone has ever been able to crack those
<drfsupercenter> 03and that's just completely unacceptable
<drfsupercenter> 03Um
<drfsupercenter> 03give me an example.
<Phase4> inb4 kick/ban
<Ninjazz> Okie Dokie Lokie...
<suckmydick> THIS IS SO HOT
<MahBoi777> wtf
<Shizuka> 13technically i grew up in bloomington but it's attached to normal so close enough
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<Aurora> yeah that was rather frustrating
<Midnight_Tempest> dat kick
<Master_Chief> this is just like dissdia ....a combination of various characters from different series in one game.....i wish they would make more game like this
<mario_pony> ._.
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's only going to get worse LOL
<Midnight_Tempest> wait for him to come back...
<BlueFlare> 02I didn't know*
<MahBoi777> ugh
<Shane377> hey hey Shizuka
<Meanwhile> I load up the stream to jiggle physics. Because that's how a drill works!
<panda> wait, im not sure what happened who got kicked? and for what?
<Polydunami> UGH
<Phase4> there he is
<Aurora> I was playing in my room, my room is rather notorious for having an awkward dead spot at my bed
<drfsupercenter> 03Ubisoft did something like it, their servers went offline for a whole weekend
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<drfsupercenter> 03hilarity ensued
<Aurora> the internet cuts out
<Polydunami> Go away, suckmydick :[
<Chrysalis> heya Meanwhile
<Aurora> meh

<mario_pony> panda: scroll up

<MaidSurge> Ohai Meanwhile!
<Midnight_Tempest> lol
<Aurora> so I tend to be positive and not get irked with things
<mario_pony> hi Meanwhile
<drfsupercenter> 03I just do my research before I buy stuff XD
<Midnight_Tempest> one more come on... wanna see that ban
<Aurora> I did too

<DeathStar> panda: suckmydick did for haveing an inopropriate nick

<Polydunami> Well, then. Somepony who complies
<Chrysalis> ooh hes changed his name
<panda> Chrysalis: shhh.... dont tell him
<Meanwhile> I already dread to know what he drew me doing.
<Master_Chief> imagine a game that had all...and i mean ALL different character in that one game....HOW COOL WOULD THAT BE
<MahBoi777> lol
<Aurora> 6I traded in used games, I got 100 dollars in credit due to insane bonuses since i put it towards D3
*DeathStar dances AFK for a bit
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile got drawn?
<panda> derpy_pony: omg... WHY WOULD YOU
<Aurora> 6bought it along with a couple other things
<Midnight_Tempest> derpy_pony: why would you post that...
<Ninjazz> I miss everything...
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz: yes lol
<BlueFlare> 02ah
<Aurora> 6there was absouely no downside to this
<Nick> :D
<Chrysalis> Ninjazz yeah, he was with trixie
<Hogia|Animation> 12wonderful
<Ninjazz> I though so.
<Aurora> 6I have NO reason to be upset in any part of this situation
<panda> Ninjazz: hehe getting a lap dance from trix
<Meanwhile> Of course.
<Ninjazz> LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03well basically you had to give up games you could have made actual money from? :P
<MahBoi777> :D
<Phase4> ohai Nick
<drfsupercenter> 03but whatever
<Meanwhile> And who requested that exactly.
<panda> Meanwhile: you know you liked it :D
<Midnight_Tempest> the chat is full of foolish people today...
<Ninjazz> I saw that coming.
<Aurora> 6uh
<MaidSurge> derpy_pony: meh, i've seen worse stuff in fanart :D
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile no one did, he just drew it
<Master_Chief> derpy_pony thats disgusting
<Ninjazz> I think Wrek said he would do that Meanwhile.
*Phase4 hugs OtakuTom
<Aurora> 6you know what nevermind
<Aurora> 6not worth my time
<Meanwhile> Really? He did that without any prompting?
<Phase4> NO! NOT SB
<mario_pony> hmm
<panda> Meanwhile: nope, just went ahead and drew some awesome stuffs
<Phase4> <-- SuperBrony64 has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 sheesh...I try to have a nice relaxing stream and have to deal with all these idiots -_-
<mario_pony> o3o
<MaidSurge> Poor Val .__.
<panda> ValtheJean: im sorry :/
<Master_Chief> ....
<Meanwhile> Bronystate problems Val :(
<Phase4> ValtheJean, not sure what to do, cant hug you :(
<Midnight_Tempest> ikr ValtheJean... and we are trying to enjoy your stream too...
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<MahBoi777> hmmmmm

<panda> MAXIMU GIGA!!!!!
<Master_Chief> bye
<Polydunami> Wow! Look at that damage!
<MahBoi777> bye Master_Chief!
<mario_pony> bye MahBoi777
<panda> Master_Chief: bye bye
<OtakuTom> I'm having fun watching the game...gotta find some way to stay awake while at work :P
<mario_pony> oops
<Meanwhile> Seeya Master_Chief
<mario_pony> bye Master_Chief
<MaidSurge> Dat Gurren Langan
<ValtheJean> 2,14 inb4 we have to mute the chat, and then voice the people who AREN'T misbehaving
<BlueFlare> 02Drf, it’s fine if you want to pirate stuff yourself but why get mad at other people for not doing so?
<MahBoi777> mario_pony: lol curses
<BlueFlare> 02Plus some people like having a case and everything like me
<MaidSurge> Oh ok
<Ninjazz> I'll wake you, when I need you, Master_Chief.
<panda> ValtheJean: mute the chat?
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when behaving was a minority?
<mario_pony> i'm not misbehaving am i?
*MahBoi777 behaves like a good boi
<Midnight_Tempest> that would make things alot easier for the people that want to enjoy this...
<drfsupercenter> 03it's more that I laugh when people pay for something and then whine when it doesn't work because they didn't realize they were buying something with DRM :P
<Ninjazz> Is it that hard to behave?
<mario_pony> nope
<Aurora> 6I wasn't whining -_-
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said YOU were
<MahBoi777> not at all
<Polydunami> I don't know most of these faces
<panda> not at all
<panda> some peopel are just stupid i guess
<Midnight_Tempest> panda: +m is the mute function for all irc chats... makes it so only certain people, like mods can talk
<mario_pony> lol
<panda> people*
<Meanwhile> I can't pretend I have any idea what's going on in this game beides giant robot battles, and I think I've heard "giga drill breaker" somewhere before.
<panda> Midnight_Tempest: hm... I didnt know :D
<MaidSurge> Polydunami: then you're not a giant robots nerd :D
<Meanwhile> Still, it's pretty entertaining.
<Polydunami> Well, I know Zero and the Gurren Lagann gang
<MahBoi777> yup
<panda> Lelouches frown is too big for his face....
<BlueFlare> 02Did you know that you can just call customer support when DRM gives you problems and they'll fix it?
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't.
<BlueFlare> 02I did so when 1404 AD stopped letting me install it and they fixed it right away LOL
<Midnight_Tempest> panda: now you do, so if you ever see just mod colours in the chat... its most likely a +m event
<Phase4> dat music
<Phase4> i know it from somewhere
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL, go call Ubisoft and complain about their always-on DRM, I dare you
<panda> Midnight_Tempest: alright thank you for the heads up ^^
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Code GEASS
<Ninjazz> Eh.
<Meanwhile> Is that a robot dragon?
<OtakuTom> I recognize about...half...of characters.
<Shane377> ValtheJean: l where?
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, Kallen!
<panda> Phase4: its O2 the opening for R2 ^^
<MahBoi777> robot dragon ftw
<Aurora> 6didn't ubisoft basically quit life though
<ValtheJean> 2,14 on the stream
<Polydunami> I like Kallen :3
<MaidSurge> Meanwhile: an ENEMY robot dragon :D
<Phase4> the part of the song i recognise is in that video with the people and stuff
*Phase4 cant describe it
<drfsupercenter> 03ys
<drfsupercenter> 03*yes
<BlueFlare> 02they always fix it for you when you call them. I've done so quite a few times already
<drfsupercenter> 03but they didn't re-release those games
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I have a robot dragon myself
<Phase4> this bit'
<panda> Phase4: want me to link you?
<Midnight_Tempest> i recognize pretty much all the characters... but never watch Code Geass... thought it was too over hyped
<drfsupercenter> 03dude
<OtakuTom> Kallen was the only reason why I watched Code Geass
<drfsupercenter> 03IF THEIR SERVERS GO DOWN
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'll use him first during my turn
<Phase4> panda, sure
<drfsupercenter> 03THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE
<drfsupercenter> 03Or if your connection goes down
<drfsupercenter> 03you know what they tell you?
<drfsupercenter> 03"Fix your connection"
<BlueFlare> 02derp
<Meanwhile> I don't recognise anything at all. But it's still pretty neat. I like the animation.
<BlueFlare> 02then you just wait rather than never playing it?
<Polydunami> So who's... Dieria? However that's spelled?
<drfsupercenter> 03I think you saying "derp" is your way of saying "I acknowledge you're right but I'm too dumb to admit when I'm wrong"
<Polydunami> I dunno
<MaidSurge> Meanwhile: Ikr
<MahBoi777> thanks Japan lol
<Aurora> 6BlueFlare, you're missing a point though lol
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03that's not them fixing it at all
<Ninjazz> Ikr.
<drfsupercenter> 03that's you having to sit there and do nothing at a game that YOU paid for
<Aurora> 6games like TF2 and Minecraft run mainly for the internet connection
<drfsupercenter> 03when if you just pirate it, no problems
<Ninjazz> Its a pretty good looking game.
<drfsupercenter> 03uh
<Polydunami> Oh yeah! I know Eureka Seven as well.
<Aurora> 6but they're completely capable of having offline capabilities
<drfsupercenter> 03I play Minecraft entirely offline o_O
<Midnight_Tempest> i also never watched Eureka 7...
<MahBoi777> me neither
<OtakuTom> I've not watched Eureka Seven, but I recognize the characters. I wouldn't have picked out the mech as being from the series, though.
<drfsupercenter> 03or at least most of the time XD
<Phase4> suddenly anime
<Aurora> 6minecraft is lesser of an example, but i use it because i never play single player
<Polydunami> I haven't finished that one yet
<Aurora> 6I only ever play on a sever
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it only appears at the end of the show
<Aurora> 6server
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and in the shitty movie
<drfsupercenter> 03but you *can*
<MaidSurge> Phase4: this whole game is robot anime :D
<Golakka> In all seriousness val, what is the aim of this game?
<Aurora> 6that's my
<drfsupercenter> 03unlike TF2 which basically doesn't have a point in single player
<Ninjazz> I didn't really like Eureka 7...
<Aurora> 6point.
<Galloran> What have i walked into
<ValtheJean> 2,14 unfortunately this game follows the movie story line
<Aurora> 6meh
<Phase4> MaidSurge, good point
<drfsupercenter> 03or WoW or something :P
<Aurora> 6don't argue about it
<Aurora> 6it was an example.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Golakka: the aim is enjoy giant fucking robots
<Ninjazz> Amen.
<drfsupercenter> 03I wasn't, I was just saying
<Galloran> why are robots fucking
<drfsupercenter> 03carry on LOL
<MahBoi777> WOO
<Aurora> 6anyways
<Galloran> that sounds pornographic
<Meanwhile> lol Galloran.
<MahBoi777> -_-
<Golakka> I mean, story wise, Save the world? Do things to the king robots daughter?
<Aurora> 6Diablo III legitimately can not be run without an internet connection of some sort
<ValtheJean> 2,14 basically:
<Midnight_Tempest> its a game of giant robots, blowing up other giant robots... what is not to enjoy?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 all of the animes storylines weave into one
<Golakka> or is it totaly random robot killy lazor fun time?
<Phase4> whats with all the ping timeouts
<BlueFlare> 02Well, I guess you could always pirate it after buying the disk? That’s about as far as I’d ever go
<mario_pony> well goodnight everypony!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 with one major threat that they all have to deal with as a team
<drfsupercenter> 03and their servers have to not be overloaded
<Aurora> 6even moments of low connection like with my room, the game basically froze like when your connection times out on TF2
<Meanwhile> Night mario_pony.
<Ninjazz> Gnight mario_pony
<Aurora> 6I had to wait
<mario_pony> see you all tomorow
<Polydunami> Goodnight mario_pony :)
<MahBoi777> gnight mario_pony! sleep well
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Galloran> i cant understand japanese/chinese/korean
<Aurora> 6there's no reason to pirate a disc you already own
<drfsupercenter> 03the whole idea is that I *don't* want to be giving my money to companies that are going to do that crap
<Ninjazz> You don't have to.
<Meanwhile> So it's an über canon crossover mechsplosion.
<Ninjazz> just watch/
<OtakuTom> I've been noticing them as well, Phase4.
<drfsupercenter> 03because then they just go
<Midnight_Tempest> just watch and enjoy...
<Tassadork> there are dozens of SRW games, and dozens of animes brought into each one apparently... good luck ever figuring it out!
<Polydunami> Also, hey Galloran didn't see you there :S
<drfsupercenter> 03"Hey look, tons of people bought it! Let's keep it up"
<Golakka> Meh, who needs story
<Galloran> :^3
*Phase4 hugs Shizuka
<Golakka> robots with lazers
<Aurora> 6I'm still now sure why Blizzard decided to set it up that way, but whatever
<BlueFlare> 02drf, people like you are the reason they do that stuff :P
<drfsupercenter> 03but hey, Diablo 3 has terrible ratings because people actually care
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03"people like me"?>
<MahBoi777> whoa....
<Aurora> 6uh
<drfsupercenter> 03You mean the people who actually ENJOY their games?
<drfsupercenter> 03and in no way actually cared?
<drfsupercenter> 03-d
<Midnight_Tempest> dat dodge
<Aurora> 6I enjoy my games
<Aurora> 6please remove that statement
<drfsupercenter> 03fine
<Meanwhile> That mech has daft feet.
<drfsupercenter> 03You mean the people who actually ENJOY their games without interruption?
<DeathStar> wow my chat just extream derped
<Galloran> ... punch him in the face dont use a damned laser
<MaidSurge> Also almost all actions trigger a counter from the opposing side
<Aurora> 6lol.
<Midnight_Tempest> although i dont recognize that mecha...
<drfsupercenter> 03my point being
<Polydunami> I can read kana, but not kanji. So I know that's Kurou
<drfsupercenter> 03Nothing is impossible to crack.
<drfsupercenter> 03It's been proven time and time again
<Aurora> 6lets just all agree that we have different opinions here
<ValtheJean> 2,14 time for MY dragon bot
<Midnight_Tempest> yay!
<Aurora> 6this literally is trying to lick your way through a brick wall
<drfsupercenter> 03Warner spent like 20 million dollars on some fancy new anti-piracy method for The Dark Knight
<MahBoi777> YES
<Aurora> 6it's not happening
<Meanwhile> Dat dragon bot.
<drfsupercenter> 03and what happened? It only took 12 more hours for rips to show up
<Ninjazz> What in Oblivion is THAT?!
<drfsupercenter> 0320 million dollars for 12 hours.
<Polydunami> Japan
<drfsupercenter> 03That's called failing at life.
<Meanwhile> That one is way cooler.
<Galloran> hmm, they need a pony bot
<MahBoi777> :D
<OtakuTom> It's been a while since I studied Japanese, so I'm lucky if I'm able to accurately read kana ^^;
<Ninjazz> Song... Oh god the song ruins it.
<panda> Ninjazz: yes i know :D
<Midnight_Tempest> i like the song, its pretty smooth...
<Polydunami> Oh god, this song xD
<Meanwhile> Fire ALL the little red things.
<Polydunami> It's... nice.
<MahBoi777> so happy
<Ninjazz> When I see a dragon on screen... I ain't asking for much... Just not this...
<Midnight_Tempest> but i dont recognize the anime its from
<MaidSurge> That barely hurt it
<MahBoi777> tis but a scratch
<Meanwhile> Those aren't lasers are they. They don't sound like lasers.
<Aurora> 6thank you battlenet for giving me a code I can remember OTL
<Meanwhile> They sound like a kind of kinetic energy blade.
<panda> Meanwhile: needles im assuming
<BlueFlare> 02You also have to worry about getting a $250,000 fine for something you could have spent $60 on
<Galloran> oh dear lord
<Tassadork> suddenly wingmen
<Meanwhile> Is that John Lennon?
<Midnight_Tempest> dat Macross
<MaidSurge> ...
<Ninjazz> Sparkle Sparkle Sparkle.
<Polydunami> Basara is John Lennon ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03first of all, that fine is for MOVIES, not games
<BlueFlare> 02and they do like to hand pick people
<drfsupercenter> 03second of all, trolololololol9ol
<Meanwhile> You tell me that doesn't look like John Lennon.
<drfsupercenter> 03the only people they sue are single mothers and 90 year old blind guys
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<panda> Ninjazz: TWILIGHT TWILIGHT TWILIGHT
<Ninjazz> Looks more like the old Harry Potter to me.
<BlueFlare> 02that is
<Galloran> Meanwhile, it doesn't look like John Lennon
<BlueFlare> 02kind of true
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<Meanwhile> You're WRONG
<Polydunami> The glasses, though
<drfsupercenter> 03not just kind-of
<Galloran> No im not
<drfsupercenter> 03the only people the RIAA has made examples of
*DeathStar dances off to head dinner
<drfsupercenter> 03in the past couple years
<Galloran> you told me to tell you it doesnt
<drfsupercenter> 03were a single mother and a blind guy they accused of pirating porn
<Galloran> so your argument is invalid
<drfsupercenter> 03er, MPAA rather
<Ninjazz> DINNER, DeathStar.
<panda> Ninjazz: hehe i remember when I had dinner once XD
<BlueFlare> 02wait, so that really happened? LOL
<Galloran> just once?
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<MaidSurge> INTENSE STARE
<Golakka> Oki! Im exhausted, Going off to bed, Nighty night
<panda> Galloran: hehe yeah once a day
<Meanwhile> http://www.johnlennon.com/wp-content/themes/jl/images/home-gallery/2.jpg
<Polydunami> Goodnight Golakka :)
<Meanwhile> Night Golakka.
<panda> Golakka: night night
<drfsupercenter> 03the guy was legally blind
<Golakka> Also ;) is best pony
<Hogia|Animation> 12how can a blind person use the inrernet?
<Golakka> o/
<drfsupercenter> 03and they said his IP was downloading porn illegally
<Galloran> Night gola
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the whole point.
<Hogia|Animation> 12*internet
<panda> Meanwhile: JOHN F**KIN LENNON
<BlueFlare> 02well, lets hope you're not blind
<Meanwhile> Exactly.
*BlueFlare hides
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz: lol thanks for saying that I wasn't paying attention
<Hogia|Animation> 12lol
<Polydunami> Celestia is best pony >:3
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm totally unable to read what you just said
<drfsupercenter> 03due to my blindness
<drfsupercenter> 03sorry
<panda> yes rarity is best pony ^
<Ninjazz> You're welcome, MahBoi777. :D
<Aurora> 6how'd you respond
<Galloran> panda: why is John fucking Lennon?
<MahBoi777> xD
<Aurora> 6anyways
<drfsupercenter> 03uh
<Meanwhile> Pinkie Pie is best pony.
<Aurora> 6uh
<drfsupercenter> 03braille keyboard
<Galloran> i dont think lennon enjoys that
*drfsupercenter runs
<Hogia|Animation> 12I'd be hard pressed to draw this well with no sight
<panda> Galloran: O_o
<Aurora> 6braile screens now?
<MahBoi777> indeed Meanwhile
<Aurora> 6that should happen...
<MaidSurge> Wow, that obliterated the robot dragon
<Ninjazz> Huh? Twilight is best pony. My favorite is Rarity.
<Hogia|Animation> 12lol
*Aurora 6trololol
<Hogia|Animation> 12actually
<Tassadork> I love how every attack is this little video scene... game takes forever and is shameless
<Galloran> lies, Luna is best pony
<BlueFlare> 02that would be cool XD
<Hogia|Animation> 12good idea
<drfsupercenter> 03that would be pretty difficult to do
<Ninjazz> No.
<Hogia|Animation> 12but how?
<Aurora> 6that would be awful
<Midnight_Tempest> dat Aquarion... and its moon pawnch
<drfsupercenter> 03because you'd have to have a way for the dots to retract when you scroll
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<panda> Ninjazz: you are now more fabulous! rarity is my fav :D
<Meanwhile> Dat groin punch
<MaidSurge> TO THE MOOOOOOOONN
<Ninjazz> Just kidding. :P
<drfsupercenter> 03text to speech is really the more ideal way
<MahBoi777> dayum
<drfsupercenter> 03and vice versa
<Aurora> 6^
*Ninjazz hugs panda
<Galloran> Say hello to Luna for me!
<panda> MOOOOOON PPPPAAAAAAAWWWWWWNNNNCCCCHHHH
<BlueFlare> 02yeah
<Aurora> 6I was about to say that
<Ninjazz> ANOTHER RARITY FAN!
<Aurora> 6anyways
<Ninjazz> HUZZAH!
<Hogia|Animation> 12mind readers
<Hogia|Animation> 12all of you
<panda> THE RARITY FANS HAVE BEEN DOUBLED!
<panda> xD
<Meanwhile> From 1 to 2.
<MaidSurge> That was Celestia's mech right? :D
<BlueFlare> 02either way, that still would be pretty neat
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<Ninjazz> Btw, Polydunami, Celestia is most misuderstood pony. :( I love her though.
<Galloran> FIRE THE PONY MISSILE!
<Aurora> 6admittedly I'll be a little more careful with downloading stuff if the US decides so go through with its stupidity
<Aurora> 6but for the most part
<Polydunami> I liek Celestia :3
<Midnight_Tempest> i like Rarity... she just isnt my fav pony...
<Aurora> 6I don't give a crap about things
<panda> Ninjazz: well... yeah... shes not a troll or a molester... shes does have a nice plot though XD lmao jk
<Ninjazz> Shaddap, Meanwhile.
<Aurora> 6it's not like i pirate everything either
<drfsupercenter> 03I basically relay it all through Germany :D
<Aurora> 6I buy a lot too
*drfsupercenter runs
<Meanwhile> ^_^
<drfsupercenter> 03well same here
<panda> Meanwhile: shush you!
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually have a quite large legal movie collection
<panda> didnt even notice your comment!
<Aurora> 6^
<drfsupercenter> 03and you should see how much I waste on Xbox Live
<Ninjazz> Eh. Rarity fans are just like diamonds.
<drfsupercenter> 03like the arcade games
<Meanwhile> xD
<Ninjazz> Rare.
<MaidSurge> Mazinger!
<panda> Ninjazz: hehe
<drfsupercenter> 03it's more, if it's easy enough to pirate it I will
<Hogia|Animation> 12I pirated Flash ._.
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: Shiny and good for drilling?
<Midnight_Tempest> i can see it now... it takes 3 people to pilot Aquarion... Celestia, Luna and Cadance...
<drfsupercenter> 03if not, and it's not insanely expensive, I'll buy it
<drfsupercenter> 03Hogia|Animation
<MahBoi777> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03almost nobody buys Adobe software
<Galloran> Ninjazz, your relating Rarity fans to a precious material
<Aurora> 6I pirated CS5 photoshop
<drfsupercenter> 03because it's insanely expensive
<Polydunami> Rarity is one of the better ponies in my opinion
<Aurora> 6but then my dad bought me a legir copy
<Meanwhile> Galloran: you're*
<Aurora> 6legit
<Aurora> 6so I was like sure
<panda> Meanwhile: i hope you didnt mean that pervy :|
<Hogia|Animation> 12fair enough
<Aurora> 6my Flash is legit too
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile: ...What?... :D
<Galloran> Meanwhile: You
<drfsupercenter> 03I had to go through so much nonsense at work
<drfsupercenter> 03for upgrading a CS4 to CS5
<Hogia|Animation> 12lucky you
<Aurora> 6but I have cracked CS3 After effects
<Meanwhile> Dem pings.
<drfsupercenter> 03it was a legal copy too
<Galloran> damnit keyboard
<Hogia|Animation> 12I have CS6.
<Aurora> 6and cracked TV Paint
<MahBoi777> Lol
<drfsupercenter> 03honestly, when it comes to software, piracy is usually easier LOL
<Aurora> 6and cracked Win7
<Ninjazz> In all honesty, the only pony I truly don't like is Trixie.
<drfsupercenter> 03since you don't have to deal with activation
<Galloran> anyone know how to fix the Enter key on a keyboard
<drfsupercenter> 03wait what
<BlueFlare> 02I payed like $300 for photoshop CS5
<drfsupercenter> 03when did you get Windows 7
<Meanwhile> panda: It's only pervy if you're dirty minded.
<Galloran> this things to damn easy to hit
<Aurora> 6and cracked toon boom
<BlueFlare> 02paid*
<Aurora> 6uh, my friend
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: Agreed, but I also rather dislike Blueblood.
<Hogia|Animation> 12I still like XP
<drfsupercenter> 03OK well LOL
<panda> Meanwhile: O_o were you here when I explained my dream? D: XD
<Aurora> 6he basically handed his hard drive to me and was like "take whatever"
<drfsupercenter> 03I can get as many legit Windows serials as anybody needs
<drfsupercenter> 03so
<Midnight_Tempest> one does not simply fix the Enter key...
<drfsupercenter> 03for those, it's easier to not try cracking XD
<drfsupercenter> 03XP is easy to crack
<Ninjazz> I forget about Blueblood. *adds him to the list*
<drfsupercenter> 037 is a nightmare
<Meanwhile> No panda I wasn't. And considering current context, perhaps that's for the best.
<panda> Ninjazz: but... i like trixie, she just wanted to be liked
<Galloran> pfft, sure i do
<panda> Meanwhile: xD
<Galloran> i just remove it and get a new one
<Aurora> 6I don't even know why I have win7
<Ninjazz> panda: No... No... No... That is all fanon.
<Meanwhile> panda: Says who? She's a showboating tart.
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's hilariously easy enough to just abuse their phone activation
<panda> Ninjazz: exactly :D
<Aurora> 6I don't feel like I'm gonna upgrade tbh
<drfsupercenter> 03I've given the same Win7 key to like 20 people
<Midnight_Tempest> Simon awwww yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03and it works fine
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<panda> Meanwhile: i mean how the fandom made her....
<Meanwhile> Fanon is completely irrelevant in my opinion of characters.
<Galloran> holy shit
<panda> SIMON! YES!
<Galloran> is that Gurren Lagan
<Meanwhile> Mostly because it doesn't mean anything.
<MahBoi777> holy shit
<panda> Galloran: yes
<xmasskills|dance> lol
<MaidSurge> Galloran: it sure is
<panda> GIGA DRILL BREAKER!
<Galloran> dafuq am i watching!
<Ninjazz> I hate when people adore Trixie for her fanon when ponies like Celestia get crap for absolutely no good reason.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek poniez :3
<xmasskills|dance> dis be some hawt porn
<Polydunami> ^^^^^^^
<panda> Ninjazz: hehe i know right?
<Meanwhile> SuperBrony64: moo.

<MaidSurge> We know SuperBrony64 :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Meanwhile: I see...Moo :>
<Meanwhile> Midnight_Tempest: you're*
<panda> A WILD SuperBrony64 HAS APPEARED!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.o
<Galloran> Ninjazz: i don't like Celestia... but i love Molestia :^D
<Midnight_Tempest> Meanwhile: shush you nazi bastard
<Polydunami> xD
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: thats because celestia could do so much more but she is stuck being a troll
<Ninjazz> :/
<panda> SuperBrony64: how come you chime in at random times?
<Meanwhile> Wanting to spread education of correct grammar doesn't make me evil.
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz: I blame certain fanfics about Celestia
<MaidSurge> DED
<SuperBrony64> 11,02panda: CAUSE I can :3
<panda> Meanwhile: it makes you a twi-grammar nazi
<Meanwhile> It's killing and eating my neighbour that makes me evil.
<Midnight_Tempest> Meanwhile: no but i like to complain so shush
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: Tell me one good reason she can be considered a troll?
<Cow> MOOOOOOO!
<panda> hehe SuperBrony64 it kinda surprises me, cuz you are blue XD
<Ninjazz> MahBoi777: I blame the haters.
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: her troll actions
*SuperBrony64 pokes Cow's nose
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: And that would be?
<Glacymr> now i have my own windows 7 key
<Glacymr> XD
<BlueFlare> 02I'd want one if I ever got a macbook
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I am blue O.o
<BlueFlare> 02XD
*Cow dropkicks SuperBrony64
<panda> Ninjazz: you dont remember the tea incident?
<Hogia|Animation> 12Roara
<Meanwhile> SuperBrony64: Da ba di da ba dy?
<Ninjazz> How is that a troll joke?
<drfsupercenter> 03I totally wouldn't put it past you to buy one either, BlueFlare -_-
<Hogia|Animation> 12never upgrade to Windows 8
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: the tickets from episode three and tricking the cakes with the whole tea thing
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Hogia|Animation> 12it's ugly
<drfsupercenter> 03Well Windows 8 isn't even OUT yhet
<drfsupercenter> 03*yet
<panda> Ninjazz: it is lol, but not like internet troll xD
<Hogia|Animation> 12I know
<Hogia|Animation> 12but still
<Polydunami> That was just a prank, the tea incident
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: she knew very well the cakes would freak out
<Meanwhile> Oh wow. She reacted like a normal person would under circumstances they don't like.
<Hogia|Animation> 12it sucks already
*Galloran retreats to his bridge
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<junh1024-XD> yell at M$ already
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's also a beta
<Phase4> SuperBrony64, no your not, you're cyan and blue
<drfsupercenter> 03I should
<Galloran> Whos talkin about trolls?
<junh1024-XD> *CP
<MahBoi777> I thot the tea thing was funneh
<panda> MahBoi777: it was ^^
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: How was she supposed to know that her friends wanted to go? And no she didn't she was trying to be normal... She wanted to break the ice.
<drfsupercenter> 03same thing
<Meanwhile> People are way harsher to Celestia than they should be.
<junh1024-XD> nononon
<Ninjazz> ^
<Galloran> ^^
<Ninjazz> People need to think.
<MaidSurge> Dialogueeeeee
<BlueFlare> 02don't worry drf, I'd rather have a Sony
<BlueFlare> 02:3
<Meanwhile> And way less harsh to Trixie than they should be ¬_¬
<panda> Ninjazz: then explain her sudden disapearance when nightmaremoon came and all of a sudden shes back when she is defeated?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<junh1024-XD> LOL SORNY
<Meanwhile> Stupid tart that she is.
<drfsupercenter> 03Ew brand name computers
<Ninjazz> I KNOW RIGHT?!?!?!
<MahBoi777> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03seriously, build your own
<drfsupercenter> 03it's fun
<drfsupercenter> 03and cheaper usually
<MaidSurge> Agreed on both Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> panda: Imprisoned in the sun.
<Ninjazz> FREAKIN PEOPLE NEED TO FREAKIN THINK!
<Shizuka> 13think
<panda> Meanwhile: doubt it ^^
<junh1024-XD> i wouldn't say it's fun,
<Shizuka> 13think think think
<junh1024-XD> but it's def. cheaper
<Shizuka> 13i need a thinking spot
<Glacymr> it's only cheaper if you don't break any of the parts during building
<panda> dat Shizuka thinking :D
<drfsupercenter> 03that's also because you're a Mac user, junh1024-XD
*drfsupercenter runs
<Meanwhile> panda: If you're going to just doubt it, don't even ask.
<Galloran> Meanwhile: Fried Celestia Kabobs
<Aurora> 6convenience
<junh1024-XD> well, that too
<MahBoi777> think think *click click*
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually *enjoy* building computers
<panda> Meanwhile: XD
<drfsupercenter> 03just like people enjoy working on their cars
<Aurora> 6I dont
<drfsupercenter> 03but maybe I'm just weird?
<drfsupercenter> 03hey
<Aurora> 6most eople don't tbh
<drfsupercenter> 03LL managed to
<Meanwhile> Seriously.
<MaidSurge> Shizuka, are you Winnie the Pooh? :D
<panda> Meanwhile, we arent fighting are we?
<Aurora> 6managed
<drfsupercenter> 03if she could do, anybody can
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Polydunami> Did she just say "thank you" in German?
<Aurora> 6sorry I don't have time to waste on that
<Ninjazz> panda: Never explained. But knowing Nightmare Moon, she probably made her an equal prison on the Sun.
<panda> Polydunami: no in japanese
<drfsupercenter> 03takes like 2 hour LOL
<MaidSurge> O____O
<drfsupercenter> 03*s
<Midnight_Tempest> dat kill
<Aurora> 6no thanks
<panda> Ninjazz: lol XD
<Polydunami> In German, Thank you is Danke
<Aurora> 6I have my computer anyways
<Polydunami> I think
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: well the cakes were already freaking out and even if she was trying to break the ice it was like setting off a bomb in a structually unsound building
<Galloran> Ninjazz: Mayhaps she was tied up somewhere...
<Aurora> 6and I need to get a tablet PC anyways, gonna look over the summer
<Meanwhile> I will never understand why people take fanon and slap it on the canon as if it can in any way actually apply. It's tragic.
<Tassadork> and now I know why he wasn't piling on the boss with everyone
<panda> xmasskills|dance: she was only trying to release some tension
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: She was trying to be friendly...
<Shizuka> 13yes, german thank you is danke
<Galloran> Ahem
<panda> Shizuka, you know german?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Finding a Brony meetup near Montreal is hard :'(
<Galloran> its Danke Shoen if im not mistaken
<Meanwhile> Dancke schön.
<junh1024-XD> U sure?
<Shizuka> 13took three years of it
<BlueFlare> 02I bet drf knows how to make those
<Meanwhile> danke*
*BlueFlare hides
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<MahBoi777> canon>fanon :/
<panda> CrimsonPhoenix: san diego is much harder XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I only build desktops...
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: i understand that but sometimes its better to leave things be
<CrimsonPhoenix> lol really?
<Polydunami> Thanks. I have German friends so can't hurt to know the language
<Aurora> 6I sure what
<BlueFlare> 02I know
<panda> Shizuka: oh my, you mods are awesome, everyday i learn something awesome about you all ^^
<drfsupercenter> 03as for laptops, I had mine custom made for me
<Meanwhile> And I'm fairly sure Danke schön is the equivalent of "thank you very much"
<drfsupercenter> 03but by a store
<Shizuka> 13the schoen is a modifier, essentially "very"
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: So keep having her drink the damn tea till she became a bloated ballon?
<Galloran> MahBoi777: Cannon>canon>fanon>ganondorf
<drfsupercenter> 03It wouldn't be too hard to make a laptop if they actually sold empty laptop cases to the public :P
<Shizuka> 13also gets used as "pretty"
<junh1024-XD> also
*Meanwhile took several years of German against his will and feel asleep in lessons.
<Shizuka> 13as in good to look at
<Polydunami> Oh yeah
<Aurora> 6I don't really have need to build a computer anyways
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: she could have very well set the cup down
<MahBoi777> GANON :|
<junh1024-XD> can you please defining Parsee Mizuhashi.
<Phase4> i cannot read anything thats on stream
<Aurora> 6my dad has so many stockpiled in his company
*Midnight_Tempest wishes he had taken German, he loves the language so much
<drfsupercenter> 03can I have some
*drfsupercenter runs
<Shizuka> 13that might be the prime definition for it and it just gets tacked together with danke to be "thank you very much"
<panda> xmasskills|dance: xD
<Aurora> 6I get pretty much anything I need if I need it
<SlurryMoon> 3woo~
<Meanwhile> Phase4: But look at the pretty lasers.
<Aurora> 6no
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: Listen, she wants to be loved. She likes being in the company of people. She wants to be among "friends". See the word? FRIENDSHIP?
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<SlurryMoon> 3I'm riding the netspliet~
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: Oh don't get petty...
<panda> Ninjazz, xmasskills|dance you arent fighting are you?
<Ninjazz> Set the cup down?... Really?...
<SlurryMoon> 3is it finally...
<Polydunami> SlurryMoon: netsplit for reals?
<Shizuka> 13twilight server finally going down?
<SlurryMoon> 3nevermind
<panda> Shizuka: WHAT?
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: yes set the cup down
<BlueFlare> 02Aurora, ignore drf
<BlueFlare> 02Can I have one? :D
<Shizuka> 13seems it's been flaky for a while now
<xmasskills|dance> is it really that hard
<MahBoi777> Celestia's cake addiction lol
<Meanwhile> Why do people have to sort out all these context rules to make Celestia look like a troll. She's a monarch who just wants to hang out with her ponies.
<Ninjazz> Thats's it?
*BlueFlare flees
*Ray yaaaaaaawns
<Ninjazz> ^
<Ray> 02Morning everyone~ :3
<panda> Shizuka: really? how? I was on it yesterday lol
<Phase4> SlurryMoon, your on twilight, servers having problems aparently
<Meanwhile> Phase4: you're*
<Phase4> Meanwhile, :<
<MaidSurge> Ok, need a shower, brb people
*Phase4 hugs Meanwhile
<Galloran> Meanwhile: "Hang Out"... i have been reading to much Molestia, that sounds wrong now
<Shizuka> 13my pingout earlier put me on fluttershy in chicago finally, nothing on my modem or router log to suggest comcast was behind the pingout
*Meanwhile hugs Phase4.
<Aurora> 6Parsee is essentially the guard of the bridge between the surface world and the underground world, basically hell. She's called princess of jealousy, being able to manipulate the jealousy in others, she gained this power through her own jealousy of travelers who walked by her as she guarded the bridge.
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: Do you understand just how... silly that is? Are we even thinking about the same pony?
<panda> comcast is a horrible company Shizuka :/
<xmasskills|dance> Meanwhile: thats unorthodox and why doesnt she just use some of her immense powers to transform or some shit to mingle like a regular person
<Shizuka> 13it really is
<Polydunami> I live in Vancouver so why am I on the Rarity server?
<Meanwhile> xmasskills|dance: Why should she have to do that.
<Midnight_Tempest> i dont know what server im on...
*Ninjazz facehoof
<Polydunami> I live nowhere NEAR London
<Meanwhile> What's the lesson in "Hide your true self to fit in"
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: yes and you are being equally silly
<panda> Shizuka, if you dont mind me asking, what region on you in?
<Phase4> Midnight_Tempest, /whois Midnight_Tempest will tell you
<Polydunami> London, England that is
<Phase4> Midnight_Tempest, your on applejack btw
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: No, man. You are thinking of some kind of Marry Sue.
<Meanwhile> Phase4: you're*
<Polydunami> panda, that's the Minnesota region
<Midnight_Tempest> Phase4: sweet
<panda> Shizuka: oh wait.... shoot i know
<panda> Polydunami: yeah i totally forgot she said she was in minn
<Shizuka> 13told you..
<Phase4> Meanwhile, i will probably get that wrong all night
<Ninjazz> Perfect in everyway possible.
<MahBoi777> lol
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: give me an example as to why im thinking of mary sue
<Meanwhile> Phase4: That's fine, I'll correct you all night.
<Phase4> Meanwhile, brohoof? /)
<Galloran> "I don't always watch animes... but when i do, i prefer to do it on BronyState. Stay Manly my friends"
<Midnight_Tempest> Meanwhile... ur not gunna stop meh fram talkingz badz...
<Meanwhile> Phase4: Yes. Brohoof. (\
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL album covers with random anime characters on them
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: You just think that she should just disguise herself with some spell and be amongst other ponies?
<Meanwhile> yay.
<Phase4> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/023/Music/a7/db/fb/mzi.hdeuqfmh.600x600-75.jpg
<Phase4> ValtheJean is best grammar nazi
<Galloran> lies
<panda> Ninjazz, xmasskills|dance, just drop it... I dont like it when you two fight :'(
<Meanwhile> ...;n;
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: why the fuck not she does have some fucking supposed incredible powers that never come in handy
<Midnight_Tempest> damn grammar nazi's... no sense of humor
<Phase4> dat global message
<xmasskills|dance> panda bro let me deal with this
<Spell-of-Gaming> ooooo
<Spell-of-Gaming> dat message
<MahBoi777> grammar nazis are funneh
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Midnight_Tempest: says the guy who couldn't take a joke kick :P
<Meanwhile> xmasskills|dance: Again, what's the message of that? "Hide your true self to fit in with people" doesn't exactly seem in keeping with the whole friends thing.
<panda> xmasskills|dance: but, you are laying F bombs now :/
<Midnight_Tempest> ValtheJean: lol touche
<BlueFlare> 02If I get a new desktop it'll probably be a Lenovo
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: Because she wants to be normal. Why does she need to hide herself from anyone?
<Phase4> lazors
<drfsupercenter> 03why?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Half of the Grammar Nazis are trolls
<Galloran> To many arguments! i can't pay attention!
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: how are you so sure she wants to be normal
<BlueFlare> 02Lenovo is awesome, that's why :P
<MahBoi777> >_(\
<panda> xmasskills|dance, its only speculation :/
<drfsupercenter> 03not as awesome as getting to say you made it yourself
<Meanwhile> xmasskills|dance: same reason you're apparently so sure she's a troll ¬_¬
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: Because of the so called "troll" incidents you seem to be over exagerating.
<drfsupercenter> 03I have a sticker on my computer saying "don't forget to be awesome", your argument is invalid
*drfsupercenter hides
<panda> STOP FIGHTING ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!
<BlueFlare> 02lmao
<panda> PLEASE!!!!!!! :'(
<Meanwhile> This isn't fighting, this is debate.
<Polydunami> I had no idea we were in a netsplit right now
<drfsupercenter> 03it came with the Alex Day CD I bought
<drfsupercenter> 03DFTBA is their "record label"
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03and >independent music
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually support those people
<xmasskills|dance> Meanwhile: yes thats right so Ninjazz is being equal to what he is saying he dislikes
<panda> Meanwhile, well xmass was droppin F bombs :/

<xmasskills|dance> hey WALL-E_EVE

<Ninjazz> I don't like Trixie, I like Celestia. I think for OBVIOUS reasons I can be justified for that.
<panda> xmasskills|dance: k ^^ I just dont wanna see my bro fighting ya know?
<BlueFlare> 02welcome to the club :3
<xmasskills|dance> MahBoi777: heck?
*Polydunami pours a mug of cider and hands it to WALL-E_EVE :3

<Spell-of-Gaming> ohai WALL-E_EVE, help yourself to the buffet. :)

<drfsupercenter> 03depends on which club :P
<Aurora> 6but I was up most of all night
<Aurora> 6so I was gonna sleep early tonight
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: i guess its all a matter of opinion really so can we drop the subject
<WALL-E_EVE> Just branded myself a brony yesterday. ^^
<drfsupercenter> 03as was I LOL
<Hogia|Animation> 12 5:40 pm here
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why I napped earlier
<Meanwhile> As a roundoff of the whole Trollestia scenario, I find the Celestia is a troll jokes amusing, but when people try to make it out as her canon personality I put my palm through my face.
<drfsupercenter> 03and got so disoriented
<BlueFlare> 02this is the stay up all night talking to drf club
<Aurora> 6I kinda napped on the front lawn for a couple minutes
<drfsupercenter> 03because I'm just that cool
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Polydunami> MahBoi777: Why am I thinking of Paranoia Agent right now?
<xmasskills|dance> WALL-E_EVE: well welcome to the herd
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd be scared to nap in a public place
<drfsupercenter> 03since around here
<MahBoi777> WELCOME WALL-E_EVE
<Hogia|Animation> 12yes you are
<drfsupercenter> 03I would probably wake up and have no wallet
<Aurora> 6decided hey I'll go to bed at 11:30
<drfsupercenter> 03or anything else
<Hogia|Animation> 12:c
<Aurora> 6then I played diablo
<panda> WALL-E_EVE: branded?
<Aurora> 6whoops
<Hogia|Animation> 12lol
<Spell-of-Gaming> WALL-E_EVE: So, what made you become a brony? :)
<Aurora> 6see
<Meanwhile> Lil Miss Rarity branded.
<Aurora> 6the art department
<panda> Meanwhile: wait what?
<MahBoi777> Polydunami: Lol no idea
<Aurora> 6people are scared of us I think
<xmasskills|dance> panda: dont delve to much some people just have their kinks
<Aurora> 6there's campus
<Aurora> 6and then there's us
<WALL-E_EVE> My lame pun relating to how cattle are branded by a particular owner.
<drfsupercenter> 03that's like us with engineering
<drfsupercenter> 03or well
<drfsupercenter> 03at umich
<Aurora> 6we stay in our own corner
<WALL-E_EVE> >_>
<drfsupercenter> 03here the entire school is engineering
<panda> xmasskills|dance: oh hehe
<Polydunami> Because in my head, H-bomb = mushroom cloud
<Aurora> 6and basically, everyone in the art department knows who I am
<Meanwhile> panda: If you don't know who Lil Miss Rarity is, better we leave it that way.
<panda> WALL-E_EVE: well. you got a tat?
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: Look, man. I know Celestia isn't everyone's favorite but I just don't want people to just think Celestia as the wrong pony. You do know that she gets so much crap for no good reason.
<Aurora> 6and knows 1) not to mess with me, and 2) not to wake me up
<panda> Meanwhile: omg tell me!!!!!
<Aurora> 6so I'm pretty safe
<Ninjazz> panda: No. Don't ask. Trust me.
<drfsupercenter> 03well you know people
<Ninjazz> TRUST. ME.
*DeathStar dances on WALL-E_EVE s head

<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: i dont hate celestia i just feel like with all that POWAH she could be so much greater
<BlueFlare> 02same drf
<Aurora> 6not sleeping really throws off your sense of time
<Midnight_Tempest> just tell him... i want to see someone scarred for life again

<BlueFlare> 02reminds me of a song
<Aurora> 6I'm going to disneyland
<DeathStar> WALL-E_EVE: pro tip no.1 if you type part of someones nick in chat and press tab it compleats it for you and pings them when you send it

<drfsupercenter> 03I should try to stage a picture for splash mountain or whatever
<drfsupercenter> 03ZXD
<drfsupercenter> 03*XD
<Meanwhile> Slurry appears to be having issues.
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: As a Rarity fan, I know that well.
<Aurora> 6you should
<xmasskills|dance> panda all the grimdark fanfics make me laugh
<Midnight_Tempest> panda: cause most people that read it were probably young kids...
<Meanwhile> You make it that time SlurryMoon?
<Aurora> 6that reminds me I should get my friend to upload that picture we took last time
<Spell-of-Gaming> panda: What are you two talking about? Cupcakes? :P
<SlurryMoon> 3heheh
<drfsupercenter> 03do they give you digital ones or do you basically have to scan them?
<panda> Midnight_Tempest my little bro read it and he was like... "ok?"
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: im an applejack fan really
<panda> Spell-of-Gaming: no hehe yeah :D
<Polydunami> You alright SlurryMoon?
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: Aye. But you see, know one really hates Applejack. Just that she isn't much loved.
<SlurryMoon> 3heheh, yeah, I'm fine
<Meanwhile> Applejack is underrated.
<Spell-of-Gaming> panda: I have to agree on this one. Cupcakes was a really damn weak grimdark fanfic.
<Midnight_Tempest> panda: if i read that when i was 7 i still would've just laughed at it... ive been a twisted person since i was young
<panda> Ninjazz: shes my least fav in the mane 6
<Polydunami> I like Applejack's voice :3
<WALL-E_EVE> Finally unloaded the last of my schoolwork off my shoulders, figured I'd check out this stream service for bronies that I'd read so much about.
<MahBoi777> love dat southern accent
<BlueFlare> 02take a picture of the picture FTW
<drfsupercenter> 03no.
<Ninjazz> panda: Fluttershy for myself.
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: yea but that is just as bad but i find the personalities the fanon gives the ponies are fun
<Aurora> 6uh
<Shane377> panda: i have something very important to tell u
<panda> Midnight_Tempest: I've seen and heard worse when I was 7 >.> so.....
<Polydunami> Such a nice lilt to her voice <3
<WALL-E_EVE> I'm greeted with Robot Wars. ...Not disappointed so far!
<Aurora> 6upload as in from his phone
<BlueFlare> 02I hate it when people do that
<Aurora> 6you'll see
<WALL-E_EVE> ^^
<xmasskills|dance> Shane377: no not yet
<panda> Shane377: whats up?
<Midnight_Tempest> i like AJ, but Luna is my fav pony... then Twilight... then Trixie
<Shizuka> 13anyone else having trouble getting to google right now?
<OtakuTom> I can't say that I have a least favorite of the mane 6...
<Meanwhile> If Craig Charles was commentating this it'd be perfect.
<Aurora> 6you go up to the preview screen, take a photo with your phone, walk away
<Polydunami> WALL-E_EVE, it could have been worse.
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<Shane377> panda: i <3 u no homo
<drfsupercenter> 03...LOL
*DeathStar dances on WALL-E_EVE s head "you should see maid hour"
<Aurora> 6you can tell who's from california when they do that
<panda> Shane377: ^^ yayz
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: not here, but I use the uk one.
<OtakuTom> I just tried google and it worked, Shizu
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Aurora> 6since they dont' care to buy a souvenier
<Polydunami> As in, G3 ponies
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: That's fine. But I hate it when people get their fanon confused with the actualy canon.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Pinkie Pie is waaaaaay too innocent to do something like Cupcakes. :I
<Shane377> xmasskills|dance: i <3 u 2
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm sure we'll just buy it
<Shane377> no homo xmasskills|dance
<panda> Shizuka: its comcast ^^
<Meanwhile> And the .com seems fine as well.
<Shizuka> 13i
<Shizuka> 13hate
<Shizuka> 13comcast
<Shizuka> 13so much
*xmasskills|dance dances on Shane377's head
<Shane377> lol^ ?
<Meanwhile> What exactly IS comcast?
<Phase4> yay, i has a vhost
<Shane377> DeathStar: u alive?
<panda> Shizuka, I'd totally let you use my internet, well if it was mine ^^
<Phase4> Meanwhile, the devil and pals
<BlueFlare> 02once we did that
<Midnight_Tempest> comcast is an internet provider
<DeathStar> xmasskills|dance: I'm so proud *sniff*
<DeathStar> Shane377: nope
<drfsupercenter> 03see
<BlueFlare> 02not as fun really
<Meanwhile> Phase4: Well that's cleared that up.
<Ninjazz> A cable company if I remember correctly.
<drfsupercenter> 03that reminds me of an awesome story from Cedar POint
<Phase4> one of those crappy american internet providers that hates people
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: well the fanon develops mainly ponies that dont have airtime or sont have personalities of their own
<drfsupercenter> 03I had this camera, right
<Polydunami> I use Telus
<Shane377> lol DeathStar y iz u so quiet?
<drfsupercenter> 03it was just a $20 film camera
<drfsupercenter> 03not disposable though, a battery powered film one
<panda> Shane377: because shes dancing ^^
<Meanwhile> Oic.
<drfsupercenter> 03well I had it in my pocket
<DeathStar> Shane377: because
<Meanwhile> comcast is like Virgin.
<Phase4> theres less people in australia, so we only have the one jerk provider, telstra
<Midnight_Tempest> Shizuka... how come you havent switch from comcast? or is it all you can get in your area?
<Shane377> panda: u silly colt who dances quietly
<drfsupercenter> 03I get off the roller coaster, and I'm like "holy crap my camera disappeared, did I lose it on the ride?"
<Shizuka> 13there are no other providers
<panda> Shane377: me?
<xmasskills|dance> DeathStar: you taught me everything i needed to know sis!!
<Spell-of-Gaming> Fanon is great for developing a background character's personality
<drfsupercenter> 03the guy behind me is like "Yeah, it flew out of your pocket... I tried to catch it but we were moving too fast, sorry :/"
*xmasskills|dance dances on DeathStar's head
<drfsupercenter> 03So I go look at the in-ride photo
<Shizuka> 13our other options are dialup or satellite, which would be twice as expensive and a third as fast
<Shane377> xmasskills|dance: panda which one of you wants a lift first one to reply back gets a lift
<Shizuka> 13or reliable
<drfsupercenter> 03you see me, and my camera is just suspended in midair about a foot behind me
<xmasskills|dance> Shane377: me
<Midnight_Tempest> yeah... that sucks
<panda> Shizuka: wait... they have erm... hold on lemme find the name... but comcast isnt the only one in the twin ciites
<drfsupercenter> 03My dad and I were like OMG, that's priceless
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: Not always true. But the fanon does do that. The fanon also is quick to make HUGE assumptions. Ones that should obviously be wrong, but, is widely accepted instead.
<drfsupercenter> 03and bought the photo
<Phase4> same problem with telstra sometimes, they block other providers and charge 10x as much
<Spell-of-Gaming> But it's DAMN bad for shipping. UGH. SHIPPING WARS WITH CHEERIMAC AND FLUTTERMAC.
<Meanwhile> Actually, I can't think of a particularly bad isp over here off the top of my head -_^
<Shizuka> 13they are here
*Shane377 lifts xmasskills|dance on to his shoulders
<BlueFlare> 02LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I wish Ic ould find that
<Meanwhile> I've only ever used BT and they're alright.
<drfsupercenter> 03my mom has it somewhere
<Shizuka> 13there's a DSL provider in the metro but we can't get them
*Shane377 puts panda in Shizuka hands lol
<Phase4> fortunately telstra is dying out, right now i'm on another provider
*xmasskills|dance dances on Shane377's shoulders
<Polydunami> Ugh. People actually fight over characters' relationships :|
<panda> Shizuka: grrrr....
<MahBoi777> wish I had DSL :/
<panda> Polydunami: yeah sadly... its sad
<Shane377> lol xmasskills|dance has DeathStar infected u
<Ninjazz> Very sad.
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: yea but that makes the fandom fun
<Meanwhile> Polydunami: It's a lot funnier because Fluttermac is a hilarious idea by itself.
<Polydunami> How so?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Cheerimac shippers thought that their ship was canon :I
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: In most cases, its extremely annoying, Imo.
<Shane377> /) Ninjazz
<panda> Meanwhile, becuase they both are shy?
<xmasskills|dance> Shane377: yes but only cause she revived me from the ded because of someones death hug
<Ninjazz> Shane (\
<Polydunami> Whoops
<Phase4> Shizuka, it might be worth setting up a wireless link
<Meanwhile> Because matching the characters based on them both being quiet makes for a poor relationship.
<BlueFlare> 02I think I would faint if that happened to my camera XD
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Midnight_Tempest> oh, streams done... panic mode go...
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Aurora> 6 20 bucks
<drfsupercenter> 03I lost all the photos I had taken
<Shane377> xmasskills|dance: oi remeber i gave u allergy curing medicine
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: well thats true can you give me an example??
<Polydunami> Is that all, Val?
<drfsupercenter> 03but it was just some cheap one
<Aurora> 6well
<Aurora> 6photos yeh
<Aurora> 6anyways
<drfsupercenter> 03I just got another camera
<Aurora> 6I should sleep
<Aurora> 6before I get more energy
<Polydunami> I mean, is that all, folks?
<xmasskills|dance> Shane377: it was inneffective
<Meanwhile> Seriously, you can try and spin the yarn one way or another but fact is Fluttershy and Macintosh don't have the chemistry.
<drfsupercenter> 03seriously, don't be lugging DSLRs on a roller coaster :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not quite all
*MahBoi777 gets into the panic room
<Aurora> 6which generally happens arund now
<panda> ValtheJean: what happened?
<Polydunami> I think I know what's coming
<Ninjazz> xmasskills|dance: Trixie.
*xmasskills|dance takes allergy pills
<Shane377> xmasskills|dance: u said it worked did u lie to me :[
<ValtheJean> 2,14 switching my stream method
*Midnight_Tempest has locked all panic rooms closed, trapping everyone outside
<xmasskills|dance> Ninjazz: ok how so?
<panda> ValtheJean: ah i see :D
<BlueFlare> 02well, that's why I keep it in its case the entire time XD
<xmasskills|dance> Shane377: well i didnt want to make bro bro sad:(
*Shane377 holds xmasskills|dance infront of him
<Shane377> dawww
<panda> Meanwhile: i dont think any of the characters have chemestry, but I guess the fandom dreams right?
<drfsupercenter> 03why would you take a camera like that to an amusement park in the first place
<Shane377> DeathStar: whose older xmasskills|dance or panda ?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Is Cheerimac canon? I don't think so. :I
<WALL-E_EVE> Uh-oh... I've been in the community for 10 minutes and the discussion is already on pairings. :D
<BlueFlare> 02to go "hurr durr I has a dSLR everyone"
<panda> Shane377: me? i think
<xmasskills|dance> Shane377: me
<DeathStar> Shane377: I dunno
<panda> xD
<Shane377> hmmmmm who?
<Polydunami> I've never actually seen a Fluttermac moment in the show proper
<xmasskills|dance> XD
<Midnight_Tempest> squirrels are older than both
<Shane377> who to chose
<Meanwhile> I disagree, some characters do have chemistry, but the canon will never acknowledge shipping of any kind unless it's background ponies.
<junh1024-XD> Play that foonky music is on da wadio :>
<xmasskills|dance> i know
<Polydunami> I mean, Fluttershy and Big Mac moments

<Spell-of-Gaming> Ghosties: I searched for free pizza, but I got gluten-free pizza. :I
<Shane377> this pmv :'(
<ValtheJean> 2,14 a shame Ghosties, you missed a bunch of awesome
<MaidSurge> Ghosties: I would buy some pizza for you if we already invented teleport :D
<Ninjazz> I know right, CrimsonPhoenix.
<Polydunami> Lyra!
*Shane377 hands Ghosties pizza
<Meanwhile> Dat ugly.
<Ghosties> 04Thanks for the pizza everyone
<Ghosties> 04But what did I miss, Val?
<Ninjazz> This is one of the better pmvs in my opinion.
<Polydunami> Super Robot Wars
<Ninjazz> Robuts.
<WALL-E_EVE> This is pretty awesome!
<panda> Ghosties: well... you missed ValtheJean pwning, you missed a stripper trixie and some scoota freak out :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> This PMV just shows how you do not need to force lip-sync
<MaidSurge> Did Val win the scenario?
<Polydunami> Wait, panda WHAT!?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I did
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and Ghosties: GIGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<ValtheJean> 2,14 DURIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILU
<MaidSurge> Good job! :D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 BREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Meanwhile> Dat combo breaker.
<Spell-of-Gaming> CrimsonPhoenix: It also shows that you need to use the Hub logo-free versions of the episodes.
<panda> Polydunami: huh?
<Ninjazz> Exactly. That is why I love this PMV so much. It picks the best moments to go along with the song instead of making ponies sing.
<Ninjazz> Breaks the trend.
<Polydunami> panda, are you serious about this "Trixie stripper" thing?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Spell-of-Gaming: THat too, so you won't look like an amature
<Polydunami> Or you just made it up?
<Ghosties> 04@Val:....what
<panda> Polydunami: yeah wrek drew a trixie stripper ^^
<Meanwhile> Ah damnit.
<MaidSurge> :O
<Meanwhile> I knew this was coming.
<Spell-of-Gaming> OH GOD
<CrimsonPhoenix> I would love to enjoy G3.5 but
<BarneyAndPonies> oh god g3.5
<Ninjazz> And an Applejack stripp... DAMN IT VAL
<Polydunami> Egad, more sexy ponies from Wrek
<CrimsonPhoenix> I have to sleep
<MaidSurge> G3.5 :D
<derpy_pony> catchy song
<Polydunami> Link me to this picture
<Meanwhile> As I recall, this is only G3.
<Phase4> ponies on stream
<ValtheJean> 2,14 g3.5*
<Meanwhile> Isn't G3.5 the newborn thingies?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 g3 is princess prominade
<derpy_pony> proto g3.5
<Meanwhile> Ah.
<Ninjazz> You know... I almost slapped myself when I heard myself whistling this.
<Phase4> Meanwhile, thats 3.6
<ValtheJean> 2,14 G3.6 is freaky babies from hell
<Phase4> ^
<MaidSurge> ^^^^
<Ninjazz> Oh really?
<CrimsonPhoenix> DAMMIT
<Meanwhile> I'm not that knowledgeable on pre-gens.
<CrimsonPhoenix> This song makes me stay here
<panda> ValtheJean: have you seen "when im your worst nightmare" ? XD
<Kammerjunk|Zzz> Meh. I mean, it's not Newborn Cuties or anything.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I have
<MaidSurge> This is actually a decent song
<Meanwhile> All I can say I know for certain is Rainbow Dash always dresses in style.
<Ninjazz> Okay, so g3 is the Princess crap. g3.5 is the chibby ponies. g3.6 is the abomination?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 imo, you shouldn't call yourself a brony if you don't love this song
<Spell-of-Gaming> This is a pretty decent song for G3.5
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: Yeah I think so.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Meanwhile you forgot SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
<Polydunami> This is a neat song, actually
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: that's G1 >_>
<MaidSurge> Ninjazz: you got it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> still Pre gen
<CrimsonPhoenix> gen4**
<Ninjazz> I didn't even know that g3.6 was a gen. I guess you learn something everyday.
<Meanwhile> Val: Imo liking this makes you a bad person. But I guess that's how opinions work ;P
<junh1024-XD> its quite ling
<Shane377> xmasskills1: i won
<junh1024-XD> *long

<Ghosties> 04That's cool, Val. I'm not really a brony anyways >.>
<Ninjazz> wut...
<BlueFlare> 02http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/pokmon-condescending-archer.png
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Neither am I :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> HABAHABA ZOOD ZOOD
<Meanwhile> I have no idea what's going on.
<CrimsonPhoenix> ZOOT ZOOT**
*DeathStar dances
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I could fade it out?
<Polydunami> What's the definition of brony anyway?
<SirGanjalf> zoot zoot zoot zoot zoot zoot zoot
<Glacymr> hmm
<ValtheJean> 2,14 depends on who you ask
<Ghosties> 04Ahem
<DeathStar> hubbahubbazootzoot
<Ghosties> 04Let me, Val
<Kammerjunk> People say G3 is bad. Relatively, I beg to differ.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Polydunami: for me it's simply people outside the target demographic that enjoys MLP: FiM
<Meanwhile> Polydunami: I think it's generally considered to be "someone over the originally intended age range for MLP who enjoys FiM."
<Kammerjunk> Polydunami: Brony is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Krzyżanów, within Kutno County, Łódź Voivodeship, in central Poland.
<Meanwhile> And that.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and what Kammerjunk said
<Ninjazz> Whoa.
<SirGanjalf> Kammerjunk: :D
<Polydunami> I guess I'm a Polish village then :S
<derpy_pony> is this swedish?
<Ghosties> 04Ghosties' opinion on what a "Brony" is: A "Brony" is an individual that loves and tolerates anything and everything whilst throwing out logic or rational reason and/or thought. A "Brony" will typically visit multiple pony sites, including but not limited to EqD, EqD, EqD, and EqD.
<Meanwhile> lol.
<Meanwhile> Dat definition.
<Kammerjunk> Do ho ho.
<SirGanjalf> derpy_pony: What Kammerjunk just said? Polish
<Ninjazz> Sounds about right. yeah!
<Polydunami> I'm not a brony to that extent
<panda> Ghosties: thats a wonderful deffinition :D
<MaidSurge> I actually almost never visit EqD
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ghosties you forgot tumblr
<Ghosties> 04You're lucky, MaidSurge
<ValtheJean> 2,14 which is why I'm no longer a brony
<Ghosties> 04Very very lucky
<Pinkies4thWall> Ghosties: I rarely visit EqD. Am I not a brony? :(
<Meanwhile> I have EqD open right now.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 as the term has evolved beyond me, and its original definition
<Ninjazz> Thats why I am reluctant to call Gaben and Notch bronies.
<Spell-of-Gaming> The fanfics featured on EqD don't interest me. AT ALL. :I
<Pinkies4thWall> WOOOT
<panda> Ninjazz: am I a brony?
<Ghosties> 04"Brony" is a term for many young kids that got are more into the fandom and EqD
<Polydunami> This song
<Vordox> >.>
<Ninjazz> panda: I believe so. :S
<Ghosties> 04Brony doesn't apply to those of us that were around for the beginning or so
<Vordox> HOW DARE YOU GHOSTIES
<Vordox> No sprite for youuuu!
<panda> Ninjazz: wait... why that face?
<Pinkies4thWall> Dat Caramel
<MaidSurge> Ghosties: there's this neat forum made by goons, it's a place with nice people :D
<Polydunami> Caramel is a dancer :3
*Ghosties shrugs "Hey man, brony just isn't what it used to be
<Spell-of-Gaming> Caramel is dancing
<Ghosties> 04"
<Meanwhile> You're kinda hung up on that term arentcha Ghosties.
<CrimsonPhoenix> it changed...like the word troll
<Ninjazz> panda: I mean I love you to death for being a Rarity fan. But at this point being a brony generally just means "an older person who likes ponies".
*Shane377 takes xmasskills1 off his shoulder and puts panda instead
<panda> I LOVE THIS SONG!
<MaidSurge> This song is quite catchy :)
<Shane377> ^ child
<junh1024-XD> my quad mixes that i did were eh
<Ghosties> 04I kinda like to think of it as EqD putting a very very bad spin on what a "Brony" is
<Kammerjunk> To me, a 'brony' is a person who is a fan of MLP:FiM but is over the age group society wants us to be and/or not a girl.
<panda> Ninjazz: wait... is that bad?
<Kammerjunk> Oh, wait.
<Kammerjunk> Sorry, I just woke up.
<Meanwhile> Personally I think blind love and tolerance is silly.
<Ninjazz> panda: No. Why would it be? :O
<CrimsonPhoenix> You can thank Sethisto
<xmasskills1> Shane377: i guess im to old to be carried by big bro...
<Ghosties> 04Oh, I do
<Ghosties> 04I do thank Sethisto
<junh1024-XD> 1 was lulzily done in A3 when i discovered that it actually did surround (but not very well)
<Meanwhile> Sethisto is a bad person anyway.
<Ghosties> 04Every day
<Ghosties> 04Every
<Ghosties> 04Single
<Ghosties> 04Day
*Shane377 pats xmasskills1 tough luck
<panda> Ninjazz: not sure lol! I like ponies and I love and tolerate the shizz out of EVERYTHING :D
<MaidSurge> Caramel is dancing to this too :D
*Shane377 picks ups panda
<junh1024-XD> 2: the instrumental doesn't upascale well to quad
<CrimsonPhoenix> OMG I'm not alone thinking Sethisto is horrible?
<Ninjazz> Seth is not good for he is a rabid Trixie fan.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Thank god
<panda> PONYLAND
<Ghosties> 04...you
<xmasskills1> Shane377: thats fine i didnt like being carried anyways *silent sob*
<panda> wait... is caramel dancing to the song?
<Polydunami> Yep
<Shane377> daww
<Ghosties> 04Really didn't know that Seth was hated by a majority of fans fo the show?
<Ghosties> 04*of
<Meanwhile> Caramel is currently under manual control.
<Shane377> DeathStar: can u cheer xmasskills1 up

<Polydunami> I didn't know Seth was hated to begin with

<SirGanjalf> oh dear
<MaidSurge> I have a very vague idea about who Sethisto is, except for his Trixie obsession
<Kammerjunk> Shane377: He's the guy who made Equestria Daily.
<Ninjazz> SHoo Be doo Shoop Shoop Be do!
<Ghosties> 04He's the guy who cashes in on naive bronies
<Shane377> Kammerjunk: wow thats kinda irony
<panda> Ninjazz: you know... I used to hate this song... now i love it XD
<xmasskills1> inb4 SPAM
<CrimsonPhoenix> Also Sethisto had a horrible Net History
<Ghosties> 04He's the guy who thinks that his word is law
<Meanwhile> I only use EqD for the news.
<Ninjazz> panda: I know right! The magic of sea ponies. @_@
<Shane377> Kammerjunk: that he made eqd and bronies h8 him
<Shane377> CrimsonPhoenix: how so

<Shane377> ValtheJean: and CrimsonPhoenix wat does it say
<panda> Ghosties: who?
<CrimsonPhoenix> He was a very deep fn of Cynder
<RX-78-SweetieBot> And sadly hes become more or less the face of the fandom
<Ghosties> 04He cashes in on the damn fandom
<Phase4> ValtheJean, know who?
<Ghosties> 04Sethisto, founder of EqD
<Ninjazz> Shit, Val. What do you mean?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 sethisto
<Shane377> Cynder?
<Phase4> ah
<MaidSurge> ValtheJean: did you?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Like BEYOND fan of Cynder

<drfsupercenter> 03which oine

<SirGanjalf> Sethisto sounds kinda like a villain name
<drfsupercenter> 03*one
<drfsupercenter> 03as there are promo codes to buy those
<Shane377> CrimsonPhoenix: wuts Cynder
<drfsupercenter> 03still

<BarneyAndPonies> How dare he!!!
<SlurryMoon> 3>> [03:18:49] <SirGanjalf> Sethisto sounds kinda like a villain name
<Ghosties> 04They'll post anything remotely related to news, lemme just say that
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hence why we have to fucking fight for every post we got
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL random Asian girl in the photo
<Kammerjunk> SirGanjalf: I concur.
<SlurryMoon> 3inb4 bronystate game vs. seth
<Meanwhile> Oh I know, how dare he post what he wants on his site ¬_¬
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Ninjazz: do you not remember shitty belle?
<Shane377> CrimsonPhoenix: wats so bad about him can u tell me
<Pinkies4thWall> ^ SlurryMoon
<Ninjazz> I don't think I was around while it was running. :S
<junh1024-XD> "there were 22 asians, 7 korean, 2 africans...."
<Ghosties> 04It's not just that Meanwhile, because he has so many people in his pocket whatever he says is law
<Ninjazz> The poop Tumblr right?
<junh1024-XD> "don't you mean 22 chinese?"
<ValtheJean> 2,14 meanwhile: when you claim to be the voice of a fandom, selective reporting is the opposite of what you want

<Ghosties> 04He just makes a lot of good fans look bad

<junh1024-XD> a conversation by two asians
<junh1024-XD> i mean, chinese
*junh1024-XD runs
<panda> love is the holocaust?
<Ghosties> 04It's not that
<Ghosties> 04Love is a great thing
<Ninjazz> What did you mean about "shitty belle", Val?
<Ghosties> 04Love is a wonderful thing
<Kammerjunk> panda: Well, if you don't die quick and you don't get thinner.
<Phase4> its like whistles
<Ghosties> 04But it shouldn't be handed out like it's candy
<Phase4> whistles are great right?
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: Did you never encounter that?
<yifle1> good morning everypony
<Ghosties> 04Love is special, it should be earned, you know?
<MaidSurge> What is this song? :D
<panda> Kammerjunk: oh hi!
<Pinkies4thWall> Yes they are Phase4
<Meanwhile> If not, be glad and don't go looking for it.
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi.
<SirGanjalf> That song kinda reminds of Tim Minchins "Love Song"
<Polydunami> Oh my
<Phase4> whait... i was goign to play games
<panda> Ghosties: yes i know what you mean
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Ninjazz: it was just one of the many risque things he's posted in the past
<Phase4> bronystate, you take my game time! yu do that
<Shane377> OMG THIS PMV SO MUCH WUB soz caps
<panda> YOUR GONNA GO FAR RAINBOW ^^
<DeathStar> I <3 this!!!!
<Ninjazz> Ahhhh. He posted that?
<Polydunami> Didn't know The Offspring were a bunch of girls
<Kammerjunk> Oh right, I have tea waiting to be made. I shall abscond.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 in one of the drawfriends
<Ninjazz> Well, then...
<panda> Ghosties: well... now i dont like EqD lol
<Ghosties> 04But, going back to what I said, "Brony" just doesn't have the same meaning or feeling it did last year
<MaidSurge> I like The Offsprings :$
<Meanwhile> No offence Val but I really don't think you actually have a problem with potentially risque content so much as you're just rubbing it in.
<Ninjazz> That's certainly not appropriate.
<Ghosties> 04Shit's changed...the fandom's changed
<Ghosties> 04For the worse
<ValtheJean> 2,14 huh?
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<BarneyAndPonies> I miss the old fandom
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ghosties: even though I'm in te newer wave of fans
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Meanwhile: you really couldn't be farther off
<panda> Ghosties: :/ really? im kind of a newbie, can you explain it to me?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I support the old fandom
<CrimsonPhoenix> even though I never experience it
<Meanwhile> Fair enough.
<Ghosties> 04Okay, listen
<Polydunami> Looks like I started watching the show at a wrong time :S
*panda listens to Ghosties
<Ghosties> 04Last year it was evident that every fan was the same
<panda> alright
<Ninjazz> Right, we all liked ponies.
<Meanwhile> I've been in this fandom for over a year but I've never considered the 'politics' of it. And looking at it that's probably a good thing.
<yifle1> hows going
<Ninjazz> Politics is never a good thing.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 meanwhile: it's a VERY good thing
<panda> is Ghosties preparing a wall of text for me? ^^
<WALL-E_EVE> Wait... the brony community is NOT a united front in its love and support of FIM? :O
<Ghosties> 04There was no one fan that was better than the other
<Ghosties> 04Everybody was on equal ground
<junh1024-XD> oi drf
<junh1024-XD> http://www.mediafire.com/?5vb4nd9ej52zz9v
<Pinkies4thWall> Meanwhile: come to think of it , neither have i
<Meanwhile> WTF collective. Score.
<MaidSurge> I outright ignore fandom politics. Any fandom, any media.
<PinkiePry> lol
<panda> OMG I LOVE THIS!
<panda> WTF COLLECTIVE!
<Ninjazz> I guess the herd mind just ain't what it used to be.
<Ghosties> 04We all came together to watch the show and that was it
<Shane377> this song what is it
<PinkiePry> :D
<BarneyAndPonies> Does it feel like to anyone else that the fandom has kind of gained it's own cliques?
<Polydunami> Actually, even now I don't consider anyone better than anyone else
<panda> Ghosties: well... we do that now too no?
<PinkiePry> Shane377: Wtf collective.
<Kammerjunk> This must be WTF Collective 1.
<Ghosties> 04Here? Yes
<Ghosties> 04Because that's what we wanted to provide when this was started last May
<Meanwhile> BarneyAndPonies: that's how the world works.
<Ninjazz> I see what Ghosties is saying now.
<panda> Ghosties, sorry, maybe I dont get out there much in the community.. so...
<Ghosties> 04A place where Joe Brony could come and watch the show
<Meanwhile> Large groups will become sub groups due to the human psychological desire to conform.
<Ghosties> 04Where everybody could just get along and not be "better" than anyone else

<SirGanjalf> BarneyAndPonies: I think it happens to any fandom as it gains more members
<Meanwhile> Not a bad thing in itself.
<Ninjazz> Like how the herd started.
<Ghosties> 04panda, really, I don't either. I've withdrawn so much from the fandom that it's not even funny now
<panda> Ghosties: so brony state is a "safe-haven" of sorts
<Meanwhile> It's when a mentality of "My patch of dirt is better than your patch of dirt" that shit hits the fan.
<Ghosties> 04Eh, I prefer to look at as "We do this for fun because it's fun"
<junh1024-XD> i misunderestimated the length ┐(￣ー￣)┌
<Shane377> w8 y does he run eqd i thought one of the people who made mlp made it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah...we just stream shit
<Polydunami> So Fan Dumb is starting to infect the fanbase?
<Ghosties> 04^
<Shane377> btw he is a sick buck
<drfsupercenter> 03how long are the actual vocals?
<junh1024-XD> anyway, thats the whole piano song
<Ghosties> 04Very much so, Poly
<panda> Ghosties: hehe alright ^^ i see where you are coming from
<Shane377> Polydunami: whats fandumb?
<Ninjazz> Nice, Polydunami.
<junh1024-XD> there are vocals in the middle 6 minuites of the song?
<Meanwhile> Shane377: a fandom pun.
<MaidSurge> I like this place, it's just a fun place to enjoy ponies and poke fun at each other :(
<Polydunami> Fandom acting dumb
<Pinkies4thWall> I have fun here because people are friendly.
<drfsupercenter> 03wait what
<Ghosties> 04Exactly MaidSurge
<RX-78-SweetieBot> >tropes
<Polydunami> It's not my joke
<drfsupercenter> 03I thought SHout was only a 4 minute song
<Polydunami> Not mine
<Ghosties> 04We just want everybody to have a good time and shit
<junh1024-XD> maybe
<Ninjazz> I'm glad I found this place first.
<Pinkies4thWall> ^
<Meanwhile> Yeah being on here is like being in a bar with a movie screen.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 except me, I'm here to torture you all ;)
<panda> Ghosties: hehehe well I thank ya for that
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<Pinkies4thWall> :D o u ValtheJean
<junh1024-XD> obviously, if i just put shout & piano, lined them up by the start
<panda> ValtheJean: yeah XD
<junh1024-XD> the vocals wouldn't musically match piano
<MaidSurge> ValtheJean: oh you :D
<Polydunami> Oh boy, do I wonder?
<Ninjazz> We all like it deep down in our twisted part of ourselves, Val. :)
<PinkiePry> @ValtheJean: I will not resist.

<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<SirGanjalf> *of
<drfsupercenter> 03a bit of skippiness there, but I suppose there's no way around that
<Meanwhile> Though tbh Val I have to thank you, I've become more tolerant of the past gens because of you.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: That is very accurate.
<Ghosties> 04Meanwhile is closest to how I look at BronyState
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Meanwhile: then I've done my job
<junh1024-XD> i had to stutter a bit so that the vocals blend in to the music
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because I'm not lying when I say I love pre-G4
<Ghosties> 04I look at BronyState as a pub, tavern, bar, whatevs with a big screen tv
<Ninjazz> I still hate demon baby ponies.
<xmasskills1> Meanwhile: x Ghosties confirmed
<junh1024-XD> otherwise there'd be a sudden drop in vocal volume, which wouldn't sound nice
<Meanwhile> Still better than Trixie.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03I could prolly just end it around 4 mins

<junh1024-XD> maybe
<Ghosties> 04Much better than Trixie
<Ghosties> 04Though
<Ninjazz> YES!
<Ghosties> 04I can't speak
<Ghosties> 04Because
<xmasskills1> Meanwhile: i like trixie...
<Kammerjunk> Meh. I like Trixie for the character and the challenge she poses in Boast Busters, but not in the way Seth does.
<Ghosties> 04Vinyl is my favorite pony
<Ghosties> 04And Vinyl never even spoke
<Kammerjunk> Vinyl is cool.
<BarneyAndPonies> Vinyl's awesome
<Ninjazz> She has nice eyes.
<junh1024-XD> well, wernt u saying earlier you were struggling to fill up airtime?
<panda> Vinyl is aweomse :D
<Ninjazz> :P
<DeathStar> Ghosties: now i have the cheers theme in my head thanks
*junh1024-XD polishes Shiny_Latias
<drfsupercenter> 03I was LOL
<Ghosties> 04Not a problem :D
<drfsupercenter> 03why, want me to play the whole thing?
<Shiny_Latias> o3o
<Meanwhile> I dislike Trixie for her canon personality for the same reasons RD sometimes rustle my jimmies.
<xmasskills1> Ghosties: music speaks so she kinda has spoken to our hearts *man tear*
<drfsupercenter> 03god dang it Shiny_Latias
<Ninjazz> Hey, good feels going on?
<drfsupercenter> 03stop using that face

<Shiny_Latias> Sorry drf D:
*Shiny_Latias forgotted :(
<junh1024-XD> just play the whole thing if you are
*PinkiePry is Canadian :3
<xmasskills1> Meanwhile: so trixie rustles your jimmies huh?
<Polydunami> Polydunami is also
<Meanwhile> Yeah. She does. As do all arrogant jerks.
*DeathStar starts singing "some times you want to go where every body knows your name!"
<Evil_Spike> Canadians are awesome, they are like the Australian version of Americans
<SirGanjalf> ^wut
<Ghosties> 04God, I just realized that Meanwhile has probably been here the longest now
<panda> Meanwhile: ok... why is it called "rustle my jimmies"
<panda> Meanwhile: REALLY?
<Meanwhile> panda: I have no idea at all.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he's definitely our oldest regular
<Glacymr> hmm
<Ghosties> 04He's probably the oldest (in terms of viewership) regular we have
<PinkiePry> @Ghosties: Challenge accepted.
<xmasskills1> Meanwhile: but im an arrogant jerk...
<panda> wow, Meanwhile is a vet!
<Polydunami> Interesting
<ValtheJean> 2,14 everyone else is gone ;_;
<Ninjazz> inb4 we give Meanwhile a medal.
<Ghosties> 04Yepppppppp
<Meanwhile> Maybe you can get me a plaque that says "old"
<PinkiePry> I'm here whenever I'm on the computer. :)
*Shiny_Latias noms on Glacymr
<PinkiePry> which is a lot
<Ghosties> 04I mean
<panda> ValtheJean: well... where did they go? :/
<Ghosties> 04From like
*Pinkies4thWall /) Meanwhile
<Glacymr> oh no
<Polydunami> I'm only on at night

<Glacymr> hi
*Yoshino 2floats about
<Ghosties> 04Not the longest you've been on total
<Shiny_Latias> :3
<Meanwhile> Pinkies4thWall: (\
<Ghosties> 04But when you first started coming here
<ValtheJean> 2,14 dunno, probably just left the fandom or moved to other sites
<MaidSurge> Meanwhile: it's the same for me, canon Trixie is too full of herself :D
<Glacymr> o-o
<PinkiePry> @Ghosties: Oh ok. :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it happens unfortunately
*junh1024-XD ties a string to Yoshino

<xmasskills1> Kammerjunk: glad to be of assistance:)
<Ghosties> 04I dunno man, I just want to pull up a beer with everyone

<panda> Ghosties: hehe oh you ^^
<Glacymr> hah, even more pain
<Ninjazz> I'm not old enough, but screw it.
<Shiny_Latias> o.o
<Polydunami> I have a beer every now and then
*Pinkies4thWall pulls up a root beer
<Evil_Spike> I'm a semi-regular
<Meanwhile> In 9 days I will have been here for a full year.
<panda> I dont drink at all XD
<Meanwhile> Doesn't time fly.
<panda> Meanwhile: whoa!!!!
<Evil_Spike> It's too early to drink over here
<Polydunami> And we will have a party!!
*PinkiePry 's coke is in the fridge... I'm lazy :P
<Evil_Spike> Considering it's not even 5PM
<Kammerjunk> I'm technically not allowed to drink yet, but my parents are cool like that.
<junh1024-XD> Y U DO DISS!!!
*Pinkies4thWall gets PinkiePry the coke
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<MaidSurge> Ghosties: I don't either, but we can tolerate alcohol right? :D
<drfsupercenter> 03I can chop off almost 2 mins worth
<Ninjazz> I honestly still kick myself for being a hater instead of finding this place.
<drfsupercenter> 03that giant intro
<Polydunami> xD
<drfsupercenter> 03is totally not needed LOL
<PinkiePry> hugs Pinkies4thWall
<PinkiePry> :)
<Ghosties> 04What's even funnier is that I know for a fact minors come to this site
<Evil_Spike> What did I just watch?
<Glacymr> what movie?
<Meanwhile> I'll drink on social occasions but tbh I don't really like the taste of alcohol.
<MaidSurge> :D
<Polydunami> Absolutely, there are minors here
<panda> Ghosties: wait... who started this site?
<junh1024-XD> http://www.mediafire.com/?5vb4nd9ej52zz9v < this song
<Ninjazz> Dat Pony Warp
<Glacymr> oh
<Ghosties> 04Two guys
<PinkiePry> @Ghosties: I'm twelve but I act eighteen. Can I stay? :3
<Glacymr> by who
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ;_;
<Glacymr> and what song?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a mashup
<Ghosties> 04Though I look at one as the absolute *founder* of the site
<drfsupercenter> 03between Tears for Fears - Shout
<Glacymr> oh
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh god...way to make me sad and depressed Ghosties
<drfsupercenter> 03and Eric Prydz - Pjanoo
<Glacymr> sounds like dubsep
<junh1024-XD> which i recreated
<panda> Ghosties, hm.. they arent active on here huh?
<Glacymr> dubstep
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, I don't mind Pinkie
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not dubstep
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<ValtheJean> 2,14 YOU KNOW I CAN'T LET MYSELF CRY IN FRONT OF THE VIEWERS
<MaidSurge> Are they on anymore Ghosties?
<junh1024-XD> nah, it's eletconica
<ValtheJean> 2,14 THEY NEED TO FEAR ME!

<Polydunami> PinkiePry: I've been acting like an old man since I was a teen :$
<Ninjazz> I'm the complete opposite, PinkiePry. :$
<PinkiePry> :)
<PinkiePry> lol
<Ghosties> 04The guy who really started it all was a guy from Wisconsin (I think) by the name of Hipster_Brony
<Meanwhile> Set up a vid and go do it out of sight Val, we won't tell anyone.
<Kammerjunk> I'm 15, but that's the legal age of consent (With boundaries) in Denmark, so I'll just be here anyway.
<Polydunami> Be back in a minute
*Ninjazz hugs ValtheJean :3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 god I miss Hipster...
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03I almost wonder if I can take the DJ Hero intro
<panda> Ghosties: well... he didnt abandon this site did he?
<drfsupercenter> 03and use it on yours
<Glacymr> ouuu yoshi eats
<Glacymr> who would have thought
<PinkiePry> Who is this Hipster Brony you all speak of?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm just glad we got Silverscreen back
<Shiny_Latias> xD
<yifle1> Kammerjunk> do you live in denmark?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it just hasn't been the same without the old team
<Meanwhile> "Who is this Hipster Brony you all speak of"
<Kammerjunk> PinkiePry: He helped make the site, IIRC.
<PinkiePry> oh ok
<Ninjazz> I like Silverscreen.
<Kammerjunk> yifle1: Eeyup.
<Ghosties> 04He posted a thread on Ponychan (another once awesome website that has fallen to its own bad ways) and opted for streaming movies over the Summer to get through the great pony drought
<Meanwhile> Thanks for making me feel old PinkiePry.
<yifle1> awesome
<PinkiePry> Meanwhile: :$
<Meanwhile> I missed Silverscreens movie trivia.
<Ghosties> 04I was actually there for that thread and commented in it
<yifle1> Kammerjunk> i also live in denmark
<Kammerjunk> Wow, other actual Danes in BronyState?
<Kammerjunk> I am amaze.
<Ninjazz> Man this chat is getting so nostalgic.
<yifle1> which part of denmark Kammerjunk>
<panda> Ghosties: well thats some luck huh? ^^
<Kammerjunk> Sjælland.
<Ghosties> 04But anyways, NewDCD showed up in the thread and was like "Hey, I can stream the movies!"
<Ninjazz> And I wasn't here for any of that.
<yifle1> Kammerjunk> im living in midtjyland
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh god
<Spell-of-Gaming> THIS
<Spell-of-Gaming> YEEEES
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, Avenue Q.
<Polydunami> I'm back
<CrimsonPhoenix> ok I really need to go to bed
<Polydunami> Goodnight CrimsonPhoenix :)
<Chrysalis> You know how he is a hipster brony... is that actually possible
<yifle1> Kammerjunk> around skive
<Ninjazz> Gnight CrimsonPhoenix! Take care.
<Ghosties> 04So then the first Brony Movie Night started May 13th, 2011 and about 50 people showed up for the first film shown, Superman IV
<PinkiePry> cya phoenix
<Chrysalis> because its cool to be a brony within the fanbase
<Meanwhile> Dat history lesson.
<Chrysalis> but does that really count?
<CrimsonPhoenix> After listening MOnster thats currently playing in EFR
<panda> Ghosties: but no sumerpan back then huh?
<Yoshino||eating> 2LOL
<PinkiePry> I think i've been on here a couple months
<Kammerjunk> yifle1: Just west of København here.
<Ghosties> 04Nope, no Sumerpan
<Meanwhile> panda: No that's a more recent creation.
<panda> xD
<yifle1> ok Kammerjunk>
<Ninjazz> lol
<Meanwhile> Courtesy of Nittany's bad spelling.
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumerpan
<Ninjazz> The hero BronyState deserves.
<Pinkies4thWall> !
<panda> Meanwhile: i know ^^ remember I did the pony version XD
<PinkiePry> I swear this is the best place on the internet.
<PinkiePry> :)
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/jCrJx.jpg
<Polydunami> This sounds a lot like Bert and Ernie xD
<Polydunami> But it isn't
<Ninjazz> I agreem PinkiePry.
<Ghosties> 04The following week NewDCD asked me to join the team alongside Silverscreen in becoming the two moderators for the stream
<yifle1> its nice to know that there are other bronies in denmark Kammerjunk>
<Chrysalis> PinkiePry except if you want to get stuff done
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Polydunami: that's because Avenue Q is a parody of Sesame Street
<Polydunami> Oh?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 mmhmm
<Meanwhile> -but I'm not gay.
<Ghosties> 04But, anyways
<PinkiePry> Chrysalis: Who does anything productive these days anyway?
<PinkiePry> :D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the actors have little puppets for their characters
<Kammerjunk> yifle1: I attended a meetup once, actually, in Odense. We were around 25.
<xmasskills> PUT IM AWESOME
<yifle1> Kammerjunk> awesome
<SirGanjalf> It's funny cause "gay" originally meant "happy".
<Ghosties> 04Long story short Hipster left the site around mid-August to go pay more attention to Ponychan, where his heart was at at the time
<Spell-of-Gaming> PinkiePry: Scientists. And I swear they're not even making sense anymore.
<Polydunami> I know, I grew up on Sesame Street
<Chrysalis> PinkiePry there are 2 images which best describe what bronystate does to its members
<yifle1> you can find me on facebook Kammerjunk>
<Polydunami> Oh my goodness <3
<Pinkies4thWall> YUSH
<Meanwhile> I grew up on the street. The Sesame Street.
<CrimsonPhoenix> THE ORIGINAL?
<panda> so he is a mod on pony chan Ghosties ?
<CrimsonPhoenix> AAAAAAAAW SHIIIIIIIIIIT
<MaidSurge> The original!
<Ghosties> 04He was
<PinkiePry> Chrysalis: I'm listening... Sort of. :$
<Pinkies4thWall> Soundslike it CrimsonPhoenix
<Ghosties> 04Until something happened to him and he quickly quit the site
<Chrysalis> http://imgur.com/1Duaf http://imgur.com/qn7Wm
<Ghosties> 04And...
<Ghosties> 04He's...
<Kammerjunk> yifle1: Sorry, I don't really use Facebook. Also, you might want to try pressing Alt+Shift until æøå works again.
<xmasskills> PinkiePry: wanna join a family
<Ghosties> 04Gotten worse
<panda> Ghosties: was? oh no... am I allowed to know?
<MaidSurge> This is very final boss like, I like this too :)
<Ninjazz> What?
<Pinkies4thWall> SING ALONG EVERYPONY
<Ninjazz> You scare me, Ghosties.
<PinkiePry> xmasskills: What?
<Chrysalis> Ninjazz how?
<xmasskills> PinkiePry: yes or no want to join a brony family
<Ninjazz> The way he worded that, Chrysalis.
<PinkiePry> xmasskills: Ok, sure. :)
<yifle1> Kammerjunk> ok you can find me on youtube then
<Ninjazz> Egh. Said I mean.
<panda> DISCORD!!!!!!!
<Kammerjunk> yifle1: That I can.
<yifle1> just type yifle1
<Polydunami> yifle1
<Ghosties> 04I don't know what's happened to Hipster, but I do worry about it
<Spell-of-Gaming> LOL
<Polydunami> Wait, I messed that up
<Ghosties> 04*him
<yifle1> yeah
<ValtheJean> 2,14 me too Ghosties...me too...
<Kammerjunk> I prefer the Eurobeat version of this song, actually.
<Polydunami> Indeed
<Meanwhile> Ghosties: That lead followed by the "it" honestly made it sound like he's turned into Pennywise the Clown.
<Ghosties> 04I mean he's just dropped out of the fandom, nobody I know knows where he's at
<BarneyAndPonies> well don't you have a way to message him?
<panda> Ghosties, oh no... I'm sorry to hear that. maybe the weight of all bronies was on his shoulders?
<BarneyAndPonies> or at least get in touch?
<Kammerjunk> yifle1: Found it.
<Pinkies4thWall> Kammerjunk: This IS the eurobeat
<yifle1> nice
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he always was a closet brony...hope nothing serious happened to him
<Ghosties> 04Or maybe he wised up and finally left like he should have done ages ago
<yifle1> im usual on youtube all day long
<Kammerjunk> Pinkies4thWall: I mean the not-Super Ponybeat version.
<Ghosties> 04I respect Hipster a lot but this fandom *really* got to him
<Pinkies4thWall> oh
<panda> Ghosties: wised up? you make it sound like he should have left earlier
<Ninjazz> Shit... Val brings up a good point. People actually hate some bronies, you know?
<Ghosties> 04He should have left earlier
<Meanwhile> I'm sure wherever he is and whatever he's doing he's fine.
<Glacymr> !attack Yoshino||eating
<ScriptBot> Zubat uses Zen Headbutt on Yoshino||eating! It's super effective! Yoshino||eating fainted!
<Ghosties> 04He was really really involved
<MaidSurge> Circus musiiiiic
<Ghosties> 04Too involved
<Ghosties> 04Like I would say probably obsessed
<Glacymr> knocked out by a zubat, i know that feel
<panda> Ghosties: too involved?
<Glacymr> actualy no i don't
<Pinkies4thWall> Philojmena
<ValtheJean> 2,14 when you stare into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you
<Ghosties> 04^
<Ghosties> 04Pretty much that
<Pinkies4thWall> *Philomena
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the abyss being the heart of the fandom
*Yoshino||eating 2vomits all over bree
<Chrysalis> ^
<Ghosties> 04I mean he just threw his entire being into the center of the fandom
<Ghosties> 04And I'm afraid it ate him whole
<Glacymr> o-o
<Chrysalis> poor guy
<Ninjazz> Jeezus.
<Polydunami> Egad
<Ghosties> 04I know how incredibly lame that may sound, or stupid, but he really did love this fandom
<Chrysalis> there are some scary things at the core of this fandom
<Kammerjunk> However, if you stare long enough into the abyss, the abyss will eventually blink first.
<Chrysalis> there are some great and wonderful things
<ValtheJean> 2,14 RIP Hipster_Brony...best damn brony we ever had
<panda> Ghosties, so I was right. It was too much of a weight to handle :/
<Ghosties> 04The great and wonderful things are on the outskirts
<Meanwhile> Only Pinkie Pie can win a staring contest against a thing without eyes.
<Kammerjunk> I probably made a metaphor for something deep, but I have no idea what.
<Ninjazz> Aside from the obvious, like what Chrysalis?
<Polydunami> As far as we know?
<Ghosties> 04Most likely
<MaidSurge> :D BACKWARDS
<Polydunami> Also, this is backwards!?
<Polydunami> Yeah
<Spell-of-Gaming> WE SING YOUR SONGS
<Kammerjunk> This sounds like a song from the Hunchback from Notre Dame to me.
<Ghosties> 04He's just gotten worse over time if his status messages are any indication
<Ghosties> 04But I'm not going to get into that because that's too personal
<Polydunami> She sounds like a non-robotic Fi
<Kammerjunk> Never mind.
<SlurryMoon> 3Ghosties, is he still on Skype?
<panda> Ghosties, oh no... I understand.
<yifle1> it sounds like russian XD
<SirGanjalf> pu parw retniw

<MaidSurge> Resisted to 5 minutes of G3.6 Scootaloo
<TheRandomkid321> Pinkies4thWall do you ever get sick of being broken?
*Pinkies4thWall blushes. thanx, Ninjazz
<MaidSurge> Still going
<Ninjazz> I still don't see it. I just come on here type words. How does that make me awesome? :$
<Shizuka> 13lol that's even worse...
<Meanwhile> Yup.
<Ninjazz> And it's my pleasure, Pinkies4thWall. :)
<Shizuka> 13why does it keep falling behind...
<Meanwhile> I think whatever's up it's probably YYcast.
<Pinkies4thWall> nope. that's what im here for. it also gives Nittany_Discord stuff to clean
<TheRandomkid321> I kinda wanna play some minecraft for 360 but none of my friends are on
<Shizuka> 13restarted
<Shizuka> 13taking this test out of the loop, see if stereo mix does better
<Shizuka> 13to which the answer is no..
<Ninjazz> I hear Minecraft 360 is pretty good. It's got 4 player split screen, so it would make a pretty cool couch co-op game.
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<BarneyAndPonies> Oh btw, did anyone hear they're bringing toonami back. Old news but still
<Kammerjunk> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Cs5pa7Tfk
<Shizuka> 13encoder is falling way behind
<Pinkies4thWall> Well its 03:15, i should get ready to sleep. I'm still here though
<Shizuka> 13far far worse than usual i'm sure...
<Kammerjunk> I dare you.
<Ninjazz> Yeah. Back on April First. I don't think they are making any plans though.

<drfsupercenter> 03but I'll fix it up later
<Meanwhile> There we go.
*Saturn 08,01wants to get married and spawn
<Ninjazz> Oh, thank you.
<Kammerjunk> Marriage is for silly fillies.
*Ninjazz throws cider at Saturn
<Kammerjunk> And Cadence.
<Saturn> 08,01unfortunately, the kind of marriage i'd want isn't legal in this country
<Saturn> 08,01:(
<Kammerjunk> oh my
<Meanwhile> The lag/freezing seems to have dropped in frequency at least a little.
<Ninjazz> >_>
<Chrysalis> poor Saturn
<somepony_else> :(
*Pinkies4thWall|stuff hugs Saturn. you ok, bro?
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: I'm not sure if I follow, but if I do, come on over to Denmark where everyone can get married in the church.
<Ninjazz> Sorry to hear that, Saturn.
<Shizuka> 13yeah but i'm getting framerate drops in audiosurf
<Shizuka> 13that's very bad
<Saturn> 08,01as the state neither recognises gay marriage, nor polyamorous marriage
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, that's what I thought.

<MaidSurge> Saturn: you'd like two women? :P
<Ninjazz> Polyamorous? You got more than 1 love interest?
<Saturn> 08,01MaidSurge: or a man and a woman, or two men, or more...
<Saturn> 08,01Ninjazz: aye
<Ninjazz> All in agreement?
<Saturn> 08,01yup
<MaidSurge> You bi Saturn? :O
<Saturn> 08,01i am, yes
<drfsupercenter> 03oh hey I think I got it
<drfsupercenter> 03via some funky fading
<Ninjazz> Wow. Not too common these days.
<Kammerjunk> No really, you should consider it. Or move up to Canada, I dunnp.
<Kammerjunk> dunno*
<Saturn> 08,01or as i prefer to call it, pansexual; which basically means i'll hit on anything with a pulse.
<BarneyAndPonies> lol
<Kammerjunk> oh
<Kammerjunk> my
<MaidSurge> More power to you then! I have already two bi female friends :D
<somepony_else> hehe
<Ninjazz> You worry me, Saturn. :D
<Ninjazz> Oh right. Scottish Molestia.
<Meanwhile> It's not lagging as much, but the freeze is still up in full.
<Saturn> 08,01hey, i'm just an old fashioned romantic who's discovered non-determinicity!
<Pinkies4thWall|stuff> Saturn: you're saying you'll consider an animal?
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Wait, do you live in America?
<Shizuka> 13sigh..
<MaidSurge> I'm still watching Scootaloo go yarrr btw
<Shizuka> 13and asuka's overheating i know it
<Ninjazz> Scotland.
<Kammerjunk> Ah.
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: scotland, aye
<Ninjazz> Yay! I pay attention! :)
<Saturn> 08,01Pinkies4thWall|stuff: only changelings and rarity.
<Ninjazz> DAT RARITY
<Kammerjunk> Well, who wouldn't.
<Meanwhile> You want to let it cool down for a bit?
<Ninjazz> You are a smart.... wait... She's mine!
<Pinkies4thWall|stuff> :D you're so savvy, Saturn
<Ninjazz> :[
<Shizuka> 13she doesn't cool down anymore
<Shizuka> 13there's no ventilation at all
<MaidSurge> Rarity would make for a splendid human female :D
<Meanwhile> :/
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<Kammerjunk> I'm partial to Twi' myself. Maybe it's because I can't stop reading, I dunno.
<Ninjazz> ;)
<Shizuka> 13going to kill this one, try a mips
<Pinkies4thWall|stuff> I still won't consider the idea of humanized
<Meanwhile> Ok.
<Ninjazz> Why not? They basically are humans in pony bodies.
<Kammerjunk> Pinkies4thWall|stuff: I kinda like humanised art. I like seeing how people depict them.
<Chrysalis> Saturn check your pm for the link
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not a fan of humanised ponies
<Pinkies4thWall|stuff> I'd sleep with a pony, but wouldn't do one. ponies are sacred
<MaidSurge> Well you CAN have female friends and be a man. Them being animals makes it easier to not fall in love for them :D
<Saturn> 08,01it takes away the magic
<BarneyAndPonies> ^
<Chrysalis> ^^
<Saturn> 08,01oooh Chrysalis, i'm so tempted to post that pic in here
<Chrysalis> i know right
<BarneyAndPonies> do it!!!
<Chrysalis> but im not sure if its OK
<Chrysalis> but its SOOO good
<Kammerjunk> It's a-okay!
<MaidSurge> I like human ponies only if done right. And rule 34 is still out of question :D

<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis: But Chrysalis always has a wet mane.
<Meanwhile> Well, no lag or freezing yet.
<Ninjazz> Don't take this the wrong way, but I would prefer it if she didn't have the underwear.
<SirGanjalf> Hey everypony i'm back what's going on? *clicks in the Saturn's link* ಠ_ಠ
<junh1024-XD> ispz
<Kammerjunk> But yeah, that picture is hardly wrong. Just look at Wrek's R63 of the mods.
<Pinkies4thWall|stuff> Ninjazz: i know what you mean and agree
<Ninjazz> Hey, SirGanjalf! YOU LIKE CHRYSALIS?
<SirGanjalf> ^eenope
<Ninjazz> Thank you, Pinkies4thWall|stuff.
<Saturn> 08,01i have Chrysalis on the back of 1/5th of my business cards

<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis is best villain.
<Pinkies4thWall|stuff> ^
<Ninjazz> ^ Indeed.
<SirGanjalf> Ninjazz: Not in THAT way
<Chrysalis> i think i shall stick to my usual nick when i get to BUCK, for fear of Saturn
<Shizuka> 13phase says audio is slightly behind
<Meanwhile> I'll wait for dialogue to comment on the audio.
<Shizuka> 13yeah
<Ninjazz> SirGanjalf lol :D
<Saturn> 08,01hahaha
<Saturn> 08,01<3
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: did your package arrive yet?
<somepony_else> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QCeIp88wEw
<Ninjazz> Hey, Chrysalis. What was your name before Chrysalis?
<Meanwhile> Yeah he's right. Just a little.
<Chrysalis> iv not heard anything from my parnets
<Chrysalis> i'm usually UnFoundBug
<Princess_Cadence> need to go for an while hope to see you soon guys! :)
<Chrysalis> but its just here im not
<Pinkies4thWall|stuff> Oh
<Ninjazz> AHHH!
<MaidSurge> I still root for Discord, but damn Chrysalis is a pretty good villain :D
<drfsupercenter> 03http://soundcloud.com/drfsupercenter/shout-vs-pjanoo
<Pinkies4thWall|stuff> Dat unfoundbug
<Kammerjunk> Valedico, Princess_Cadence!
<TheRandomkid321> IM BACK!
<Ninjazz> No wonder I haven't seen UnFoundBug in a long time.
<Kammerjunk> Et resaluta, TheRandomkid321!
<Ninjazz> Makes sense.
<SirGanjalf> It's just my luck: I went to some other site because of something that rustles my jimmies, and when i'm back... eh, ALWAYS
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll make a nice description later (unless you want to), gotta go to bed
<drfsupercenter> 03but there's that
<somepony_else> hi TheRandomkid321
<Ninjazz> Wb TheRandomkid321
<Shizuka> 13bleh... so much for that plan then..
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: well, it's coming from America
<BarneyAndPonies> MaidSurge: agreed
<Meanwhile> It's not lagged once though.
<Saturn> 08,01so it may take a while
*Saturn 08,01sent Chrysalis something ridiculously awesome
<Chrysalis> why are you ordering things for me from america!
<TheRandomkid321> I have no stream... just me? Oh please say it isnt just me
<Meanwhile> I'd rather slightly off synch audio than watching it progress 1 frame every thirty seconds.
<Ninjazz> You have a beautiful heart, Saturn.
<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis: I think that, in the words of Gollum, "you'll see. Oh, yes... You'll see."
<Saturn> 08,01because it was cheaper to do that than to order it from over here, bizarrely
<Chrysalis> man, this is gonna take more explaining to my parents
<somepony_else> there's no stream at the moment, TheRandomkid321
<BlueFlare> 02drf
<Shizuka> 13yeah true, guess that was a yycast thing
<TheRandomkid321> Chrysalis what do you mean explaining?
<Chrysalis> i'm not gonna get away with "my friend ordered it for me" am i
<BlueFlare> 02y u go to bed so early?
<TheRandomkid321> did I miss somethin?
<drfsupercenter> 03ahaha aren't you the funny one
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<Ninjazz> Depends on what Saturn sent.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's 5:30 am
<TheRandomkid321> Oh. OH!
<SirGanjalf> Ninjazz: And a Beautiful mind too
<SirGanjalf> BTW: Was that movie streamed yet?
<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis: Probably not. Before I told my parents I was a brony, I got a random gift from a guy from Sweden called Misha. 'Twas a Luna-themed shirt. I just told them I thought he was joking.
<TheRandomkid321> So saturn sent ya somethign and your parents didnt know?
<BlueFlare> 02drf, you know I'm funny :'D
<BarneyAndPonies> Chrysalis: Just yell 'merica, and point to the box, then run
<Kammerjunk> They didn't mind.
<Chrysalis> im getting them to send it to me
<Spell-of-Gaming> I found a hilarious thread
<Spell-of-Gaming> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/show/res/36356219.html#36367186

<Meanwhile> I might need a close up of someones face while they talk.
<SirGanjalf> Ninjazz: It's called "A Beatiful Mind" - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/
<Shizuka> 13yeah that won't be for a couple scenes i think

<Meanwhile> But still a million times better than lag.
<Kammerjunk> Spell-of-Gaming: Exactly.
<Saturn> 08,01that was such a good song, i'm going to play it again
<Saturn> 08,01hopefully without the clicks

<Kammerjunk> Yeah, giant hats. Must be FiW.
<MaidSurge> Now it's perfect
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's unsynced for me
<Spell-of-Gaming> :P
<Shizuka> 13now to try with just stereo mix
<Kammerjunk> I haven't actually seen much of FiW.
<Meanwhile> I'll never get why that sentry fired rockets into the sky.
<MaidSurge> Is this the unrobotized version? :D
<Saturn> 08,01this is a rockk/ska cover
<MaidSurge> Would love to hear Sweetiebot's VA unrobotized :D

<Ninjazz> Good or bad thing?
<Saturn> 08,01not sure
<RainbowDash07> https://www.facebook.com
<Shizuka> 13i guess with left 4 dead stereo mix is kind of okay cause this mid-range volume is fine for shooting zombies
<Ninjazz> lol
<Saturn> 08,01RainbowDash07: wow, neat site
<Shizuka> 13for audiosurf though i like to play with volume to get more out of the track.. which screws with streaming
<Ninjazz> Why you post FaceBook?
<RainbowDash07> yes
<Shane377> RainbowDash07: did u only just discover it?
<Saturn> 08,01hey, did you know that Facebook is valued at $108 BILLION?
<RainbowDash07> yes
<Ninjazz> I'm not happy to hear that.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Facebook is gonna be the next MySpace, I'm sure of it.
<Saturn> 08,01facebook is worth more as a company than GlaxoSmithkline
<Shane377> hey did u kno Facebook bought Instagram for 1 billion dollars
<Saturn> 08,01which is FUCKING SCARY
<Meanwhile> The only thing I listen for in any game are hostiles, that and I really don't know the difference between just about everything you've decided to tweak.
<Ninjazz> It's already taken over, Spell-of-Gaming.
<Saturn> 08,01if money is power, Facebook is more powerful than a fucking BIG PHARMA company
<Awesome> DONT. GIVE. PINKIE. A. PORTAL. GUN!
<Awesome> Oh wait, she can teleport anyways
<Meanwhile> I can tell you what the stream sounds like and what it looks like, that's about it. I'm the Applejack of this whole affair.
<Ninjazz> I wonder what Facebook would do with all that?... I think they might become a second Google.
<Shizuka> 13yeah but more help than i'm getting at least
<Shizuka> 13everyone else is asleep or near asleep...

<TheRainbowDash> Oh, hello everypony.:)
<Ninjazz> young*
<somepony_else> hey TheRainbowDash
<Gold_Demona> This was my first gameboy game.
<Ninjazz> Hey Dashie!
<Twilight> I watched that video Pinkie pie opend up and sucked her im not telling!
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh god
<kenne> heya TheRainbowDash
<Spell-of-Gaming> the music
<TheRainbowDash> I'll only be on for 15 minutes, though.
<Twilight> You know wat it is it was digusting
<Kammerjunk> My first Gameboy was... A Nintendo DS.
<Kammerjunk> I was never a big Nintendo fan.
<Ninjazz> My first game was Spyro the Dragon on GBA.
<TheRainbowDash> Oooo, Pokemon, on the Gameboy! My young childhood, back to life!
<Gold_Demona> Twilight, please stop
<Ninjazz> I actually liked that game. It was pretty cool to play while walking around the house.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I used to hate Sony, until I found out how awesome some of their casual games are. :P
<TheRainbowDash> Who is streaming right now? Is is Saturn?
<Kammerjunk> I used to hate EA, but the- oh wait...
<Ninjazz> Eyup.
<TheRainbowDash> Saturn: You are amazing. Pokemon Red is a legendarey game.:)
<Ninjazz> I used to hate Activision, turns out I still do and that damn EA, oh and don't forget Micro$oft.
<Twilight> look up my clopping ponies friendship are benefits
*Ninjazz facehoof
<Kammerjunk> ...Why would I do that?
<Saturn> 08,01i don't know why it's running so slow
<Lasharus> I'm with Kammerjunk. Why would I do that?
<RoboGerbil> hey everypony
<Ninjazz> You just plainly said that you didn't like it... Now you're telling us to go look for it?
<TheRainbowDash> Hello RoboGerbil! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
<Gold_Demona> I'm still trying to eat my breakfast here...
<Ninjazz> Hey RoboGerbil.
<somepony_else> thank celestia for the ignore function...
<RoboGerbil> TheRainbowDash: im doing good
<Lasharus> I know exactly how you feel Gold_Demona. I was just drinking tea.
<Kammerjunk> I'm eating lunch.
<Ninjazz> I'm breathing air.
<Lasharus> I should be eating lunch, but I'm lazy.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Sony needs more casual games if they want to appeal more people. But like I said, "IF".
<Kammerjunk> It may be disturbing, but God dammit, it won't ruin my appetite.
<TheRainbowDash> RoboGerbil: Good to hear then! After taking my finals yesterday, I threw that out of the water. So, I feel relaxed.
<Gold_Demona> It's 7:33am where I am. So it's breakfast time. =P
<Lasharus> 13:33 here. Random snack time.
<Lasharus> :P
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Ninjazz> 9:34pm.
<Lasharus> Because ANY time is random snack time.
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, half past 1 AM here as well.
<Twilight> Did anypony watch that video?
<somepony_else> same here Lasharus ^^
<Lasharus> Twilight - how about no.
<Gold_Demona> Tru dat Lasharus
<Ninjazz> No.
<RoboGerbil> TheRainbowDash: finals eh? done for the year or done for ever?
<Ghosties> 04Man, I wish I had some eggs, some bacon, grits, sausage, and biscuits
<Twilight> I want a reaciton
<Lasharus> The title was alone to make me think 'screw THAT'
<Kammerjunk> Lasharus: Same time here, but this is my first meal of the day.
<Lasharus> You just got it.
<TheRainbowDash> RoboGerbil: No, still got more final exams in 2 weeks, ugh...
<Kammerjunk> Ghosties: That does sound delishious.
<Ninjazz> Oi. Stop making me hungry again. I just ate dinner.
<Kammerjunk> TheRainbowDash: That feel, man.
<Lasharus> And fair enough Kammerjunk. :P
<TheRainbowDash> Kammerjunk: I thought I am in the clear, and then, more tests (sighs):|
<Twilight> pinkie peis a **** sucker
<Gold_Demona> I just had me some scrambled eggs and bacon. =D
<Twilight> pinkie pie is a **** sucker
<Lasharus> Ghosties or Saturn, could you please get this cretin out of here?
<Kammerjunk> TheRainbowDash: Did you just have written exams, and in 2 weeks are your verbal ones?
<TheRainbowDash> Twilight: Woah there, slow down.
*Gold_Demona puts Twilight on ignore.
<Lasharus> I think we've heard just about enough of this idiocy.
<Twilight> O:>
<Lasharus> I know I have.
<Twilight> in videos she is *if there is a clopfic -_-
<Ninjazz> Eh. Could be worse.
<Twilight> More worse
<Lasharus> What, there could be more of them?
<Kammerjunk> It doesn't disturb me personally, but it's still annoying.
<Lasharus> Pass.
<dshannon> well, aren't those just the wet your pants scariest gameboy glitch sounds I've heard in a while
<TheRainbowDash> Kammerjunk: Nah, completely different classes. I took 2 that counts for high school credit. The ones in 2 weeks, let us just say, are benchmarks.
<Kammerjunk> TheRainbowDash: Oh.
<Twilight> Derpys special devilery is mroe worse
<Lasharus> Oh it doesn't DISTURB me Kammerjunk. I just don't have patience for people being idiots.
<Twilight> In that derpy has a ***** and breasts O_O
<Kammerjunk> Lasharus: Exactly.
<Bronies4evar> We've got a little more than forty-eight hours till the chance.
<Ninjazz> ...
<Twilight> TOld ya
<Lasharus> ...okay, now I'm becoming disturbed.
<somepony_else> he's still there?
<TheRainbowDash> They are still important though, 10-15% of my grade for the class for each (benchmark).
<Twilight> and gives soraing a ****job
<Kammerjunk> INB4 kick.
<Twilight> THERE that is wat its about
<Lasharus> Ghosties, Saturn?
<Twilight> soaring told her to
<Lasharus> Either of you two?
<Ninjazz> Okay. Borderline has been passed.
<Twilight> -_-
<TheRainbowDash> Twilight: Woah there....oh my.
<Lasharus> That'll work.
<Kammerjunk> Dat automated kick.
<Lasharus> Sadly, that just means the moron'll be back.
<Kammerjunk> Maybe.
<Lasharus> Ding ding ding.
*Kammerjunk sniffs. "Maybe:"
<Twilight> Am igonna be abnned?
<Ninjazz> Unfortunately.
<TheRainbowDash> Lasharus: Eeyup, I see Twilight back.
<Ninjazz> Yes, Twilight.
<somepony_else> just put him on ignore
<Twilight> DONT KICK ME PLEASE!!!!!!
<TheRainbowDash> Twilight: Possibly, if you keep that up.
<Ninjazz> That was your first warning.
<Lasharus> Then stop being a tit.
<Twilight> Tit?
<Twilight> Wat...
<TheRainbowDash> Yeah...:D
<dshannon> geesus at the sounds
<Lasharus> Moron, idiot, twit, arse...
<Lasharus> I've got more.
<RoboGerbil> Twilight: it says you sent too many messages in too little time is all
<Lasharus> Take yer pick. :)
<Twilight> Oh
<Twilight> not wat a said?... *gulp*
<Twilight> i*
<Bronies4evar> That's mah line...
<Lasharus> Oh, and yes, I'm a cynical bastard.
<Ninjazz> Let's all take a few breaths here.
<TheRainbowDash> Lasharus: I got super bad ones, like racist and strong stuff, that is too much to discuss in mane chat.
<Twilight> :D
<TheRainbowDash> (breathes heavily) Psshh..I am fine. There.
<Bronies4evar> Saturn....
<Lasharus> Well yes TheRainbowDash. If I were to actually write my throught pattern in here, the chat would probably spontaneously combust.
<Twilight> Im sorry what idid
<dshannon> are you trying to give me ghost of cubone's mother nightmare's?
<Lasharus> And then I'd be banned.
<Twilight> :(
<Saturn> 08,01i dunno why it's running so slow
<Bronies4evar> It's 7.40 pm here.
<TheRainbowDash> Saturn: Yeah, the game program is just so weird.:P
<Lasharus> Maybe Java's just taking more of your system's resources than expected?
<Twilight> Anyone played Luna Game?
<Ninjazz> Hey, Saturn. Can you post the link to that site? Looks interesting.
<Lasharus> And fair enough Twilight. Just put it this way: this is a PG13 chat. References to clopfics or similar are against the rules.
<RainBowJack> Saturn its laging like hell
<TheRainbowDash> Lasharus: My thoughts? Don't even want to talk about them. And I guess the Java program is too little.
<Twilight> Oh
<RoboGerbil> so anypony want to play some diablo 3?
<Lasharus> It's only sensible.
<Twilight> Lasharus where is that site?
<Kammerjunk> The rules state, and I quote, "Do not discuss or link explicit materials"
<Lasharus> What site?
<Twilight> THe pg13 one
<Twilight> ...
<Lasharus> ...that'd be this one.
<Bronies4evar> Ads taking up the gameboy screen now.
<Twilight> so you can.......
<Ninjazz> This one.
<Twilight> Nvm
<TheRainbowDash> Kammerjunk: I actually sent the story of "Cupcakes" on my 2nd day here, I was so derp back then, and still is today.:D
<Phase4> allmost there
<Lasharus> Bronystate.com. The one you're currently chatting in the chatroom thereof.

<Twilight> >:(
<Twilight> oh
<Ninjazz> Dashie... I am dissapoint. :|
<Twilight> -_-
<Bronies4evar> What is this, Zubat vs Zubat? It's like AJ vs. RD because they have the same voice actor.
<Twilight> :[
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: I forgot to read rules on my 1st day here, my bad....:D
<RoboGerbil> Twilight: send all your words on 1 message and you wqont get kicked so much lol
<diddutz> Twilight: Just try to send less than 6 messages every 10 seconds and you'll be fine
<Twilight> oh thanks diddutz :D
<Ninjazz> Well, you're here now, Dashie, so I guess things worked out for the best.
<Twilight> By the way serch a song called duck sauce it ofr mlp sauces
*Gold_Demona is getting Lavender Town flashbacks.
<Ninjazz> I only wonder why the hell you would post Cupcakes into chat?...
*diddutz goes away eating some stuff
<Lasharus> I'll pass. I"m already listening to music.
<dshannon> that's it I'm not going to bed now fuuu gb color!
<TheRainbowDash> Yeah, I guess so Ninjazz. And am well more discpined, and a well known regular, and that reminds me....

<TheRainbowDash> Bye everypony! Hope to see you at Movie Night! Hopefully,. I'll be there also.
<Kammerjunk> Valedico, TheRainbowDash.
<Gold_Demona> Sound and video are off.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Oh, only for the 1st chapter. I'll read the rest of them later today.
<Ninjazz> Alright then. Take care. :)
<TheRainbowDash> You too Ninjazz .:)
<Sumica> 00,10kinda funny how a system with probably 100 times the power cant run the game as well as the intended system.
<Kammerjunk> Not sure if I'll be there for the films tonight.
<Lasharus> Emulation's always tricky Sumica. :P
<Ninjazz> Not even Saturn is sure why it's acting up. :S
<Kammerjunk> I tried to emulate Conker's Bad Fur Day once.
<Lasharus> In theory, my system should be perfectly fine emulating newer systems. In reality, it can barely handle it. :P
<Kammerjunk> My computer was never the same.
<Twilight> im bk
<Twilight> my thing shut off
<Twilight> *not compter*
<Sumica> 00,10even old pc games have funny glitches due to system speeds Lasharus
<Lasharus> Oh definitely Sumica.
<Twilight> Guys
<Ghosties> 04Going to bed, night folks
<Lasharus> 'night Ghosties.
<Twilight> i said im back
<Saturn> 08,01okay, Phase4 is gonna stream now
<Lasharus> Yes, we're all astounded.
<Twilight> Good nighto ghostieo
<Ninjazz> Gnight Gh... Gone.
<Twilight> :D
<Sumica> 00,10Play birth of the fedreation on a new pc and space combat is done in like half a second
<Twilight> :D
<Twilight> ???
<Lasharus> Some games aren't naturally FPS-capped. For older games, that gets especially hilarious, Sumica. :p
<Twilight> O_O
<Ninjazz> I tried playing Commandos 2 on my computer. Way too fast.
<Lasharus> :P
<Kammerjunk> And here I thought bad decisions led to experience.
<Twilight> i want a mlp pony
<Twilight> video
<Phase4> ok, checking video
<Twilight> :D
<RainBowJack> Sweet and Elite
<Ninjazz> Dat Phase4 Stream!
<Phase4> oh wow, that doesnt look too good
<Kammerjunk> Dat streaming the stream.
<Lasharus> Kammerjunk, to quote Kingdom Hearts: "One who knows nothing can understand nothing"
<Phase4> i can see forever O_O
<Twilight> Phase4 you mastred the impossbles of teh internet
<Kammerjunk> Quite.
<Gold_Demona> Woah! Chatception! D:
<Sumica> 00,10oh Twilight you are luckiy I am not streaming.
<Ninjazz> Impressive, Lasharus.
<Twilight> Wait
<Lasharus> Why thank you.
<Twilight> Wat is streaming?
<Sumica> 00,10You would get so much pony
<Kammerjunk> I get the feeling you are now, Sumica.
*Ninjazz shudders
<Lasharus> At the moment, stream in stream in stream in stream.
<Twilight> *gets popcorn*
<Lasharus> It's a bit confusing.
<Ninjazz> Not the kind of pony he would enjoy.
<Twilight> *drinks soda*
<Twilight> lets gte this video no :D
<Sumica> 00,10nah this is Phase4 doing a test stream it seems
<Twilight> Oh darn it
<Lasharus> Sumica, are we talking the horrendously bad remixes? :P
<Gold_Demona> Streamception!
<Phase4> havent got the audio working yet
<Ninjazz> It's always funny seing people demand pony. Then get "pony". Then say WTF and leave.
<Twilight> Inception
<Phase4> that looks much better
<Twilight> :P
<Ninjazz> Much better Phase!
<Lasharus> I tend not to make demands for that very reason Ninjazz. :P
<Bronies4evar> Windowception!
<Twilight> Phase wats to be derp-firneds :P
<Ninjazz> Aye, Lasharus. Learned our lessons one way or another.
<Twilight> ......
<Twilight> nvm
<Lasharus> It's just the way I see it. There's a lot of streamers on the site. Sometimes stuff is streamed I like, sometimes stuff I don't like.
<Lasharus> I could throw a hissy-fit or do something else until something new is streamed.
<Twilight> Phase4 when is the audio gonna work?
<Lasharus> I think I prefer the latter option, personally.
<Ninjazz> I try not to complain.
<Twilight> Chrysalis is here O:!
<Lasharus> Some vids that come up, however... :p
<Ninjazz> UNLESS, Val is streaming...
<Twilight> :
<Twilight> :P

<Twilight> i plan on makeing one when derpy ran away from home :'(
<d3rb> if they are writen well
<Mutterguy> that's subjective to the fanfic
<Lasharus> Depends a bit on the subjects, of course, but I usually have an open mind.

<ofna01> bye scoota-chicken
<ofna01> :)
<Bronies4evar> It's 8:12 am BST. BST = Eastern Time.
<Ninjazz> Cya Scoots
<Twilight> And other clestia has two names
<Twilight> trollstia and molestia
<SirGanjalf> Is this the First Act?
<Ninjazz> and... DAT STEVE BLUM!
<Twilight> DOnt know wat moelstia is dont check
<Sumica> 00,10he has such awsome evil
<Gold_Demona> Yush Steve Blum ftw
<Twilight> .....
<ofna01> this is why i didnt buy Diablo 3
<Twilight> :| steve blum is old man
<ofna01> BORING
<OtakuTom> I'm pretty sure this is Act 2
<Gold_Demona> Steve Blum's the frickin MAN
<SirGanjalf> ofna01: Did you played the previous ones?
<Twilight> Whatever
<Gold_Demona> His voice is frackin sexy
<ofna01> i havent played any of them,i just think RPGs are stupid
<d3rb> missing out ofna01
<Lasharus> I adore a good RPG. :p
<ofna01> nope
<SirGanjalf> ofna01: Diablo isn't a normal cRPG
<d3rb> maybe not diblo but so many good rpgs
<Ninjazz> I hear you should play Diablo 2 first.
<Lasharus> Eh, if it's not ofna01's genre, that's fair enough.
<Gold_Demona> Why do you think rpgs are stupid ofna01?
<ofna01> only RPG i like is Skyrim
<Lasharus> Though asking for clarification is fair. :P
<ofna01> RPG's are too much of a grind for me.
<Lasharus> And you like Skyrim?
<Ninjazz> Understanable.
<Lasharus> :P
<Ninjazz> Then there's that...
<LittleBrony> Ah diablo 3
<Lasharus> That one is, in fairness, pretty grindy.
<LittleBrony> Looks fun
<Gold_Demona> Tedious doesn't equate to stupid in my mind, but to each his own. =/
<SirGanjalf> ofna1: Oh, in that case, maybe Diablo isn't really for you:$
<Lasharus> No Gold_Demona, but in fairness, willingly submitting to unwanted tedium IS stupid.
<Lasharus> So ofna01 does have a point.
<Gold_Demona> Lasharus True
<Ninjazz> So far, this game has really pretty looking effects.
<SirGanjalf> But still, i find most of Hack n' Slashers boring
<LittleBrony> Hard to foucus on the charecter some times though
<Gold_Demona> I think it's worth it if the game has a good story though
<Litwick> Look, portals!
<SirGanjalf> But Diablo is a exception
<Lasharus> That's only logical SirGanjalf. It's a genre you need to enjoy, otherwise it gets dull very quickly.
<SirGanjalf> *an
<LittleBrony> What is the difficulty?
<Lasharus> Probably normal.
<Ninjazz> Steve has done that character voice so many times. Still sounds good.
<Lasharus> Given that the templar's lvl 21.
<LittleBrony> But of course
<LittleBrony> No one plays on Hell or Inferno
<Lasharus> I know, but it might've been Nightmare. :P
<Lasharus> But I'm gonna say 'normal'. :P
<SirGanjalf> Lasharus: I mean i tried other games from that genre, like Titan Quest, but i didn't enjoyed them, dunno why
<LittleBrony> It looks like a Blizzard game!
<Ninjazz> I wonder why?...
<d3rb> :d
<SirGanjalf> Youdontsay.jpg
<LittleBrony> I was pointing out how all BLizzard games have the same feel
<d3rb> that is true
<Mutterguy> meh... I'm going to bed
<LittleBrony> GN
<d3rb> night Mutterguy
<Ninjazz> I'm not sure if I see your point.
<Lasharus> I had the same with Titan Quest.
<Ninjazz> Cya Mutterguy!
<Bronies4evar> When SB64 comes on, tell him to play tetris or rhythm heavenor something.
<Lasharus> There's a few decent hack and slashers out there still.
<Gold_Demona> lol Tetris XD
<Lasharus> Dungeon Siege II and III were fairly good. Not brilliant, but decent.
<d3rb> wouldnt sb just play them without anyone telling him?
<Mutterguy|SLP> bye d3rb and Ninjazz
<Ninjazz> :)
<LittleBrony> All blizzard games are 3rd person,all hae the same camera angle, and most of the charecters are very weird.
<LittleBrony> Or just complex
<d3rb> i would have said they have similar art style
<Lasharus> I'm inclined to disagree with the camera angle. :P
<SirGanjalf> ^me too
<Lasharus> Diablo has a fixed camera. WoW has a free-moving 3D camera.
<Lasharus> (For example)
<LittleBrony> You can change it but the camera angle starts out the same in most of them, like Starcraft 2
<Ninjazz> Warcraft 3. That was an RTS. It needed to have a bird's eye view cam.
<Lasharus> StarCraft has a top-down camera, but with zoom and turn capability.
<Gold_Demona> Well, all of Blizzard's single-player games have this isometric camera angle
<LittleBrony> They just look the same to me
<Ninjazz> Nice looking lighting! :O
<Lasharus> Which makes a great deal of sense for their games Gold_Demona.
<Gold_Demona> Eeyup
<Sumica> 00,10that's a mighty big sword you have there wrek.
<Lasharus> A hack and slasher like this would be a lot more confusing in first person.
<d3rb> wow as an fps
<LittleBrony> Of course
<Lasharus> And I can't imagine an RTS viewed any way other than top-down. :p
<Gold_Demona> Yes it would
<Gold_Demona> It's a good camera angle for the kind of games they use it in.
<SirGanjalf> Lasharus: Did you played Dark Messiah of Might & Magic?
<LittleBrony> I dont like games like this because of there camera angles and how easy it is too die in most of there games.
<d3rb> warcracft 3 in first person view, your character is the mouse cursor
<SirGanjalf> ^
<Lasharus> Shoot me now d3rb. :p
<d3rb> :D
<Lasharus> And no SirGanjalf.
<Ninjazz> lol
<Gold_Demona> I've played Heroes of Might & Magic, but that's hardly the same thing. =P
<Lasharus> Given that it plays in the same world as Heroes of Might & Magic V, the story didn't appeal in the slightest, so I didn't bother with it.
<Lasharus> (Sorry, but the re-imagining of the storyline from V onwards is appalling. :P)
<Bronies4evar> It's 8:22 am Bronystate time. What happens when you get home from school 2day?
<Lasharus> Nothing. I don't have school.
<LittleBrony> The only game that has a camera view in 3rd person that I like is LoL
<Lasharus> That's fairly limiting LittleBrony. :P
<d3rb> /) Lasharus
<Lasharus> (\ d3rb.
<LittleBrony> I know but what can ya do?Blizzard makes the only OK 3rd person games
<Lasharus> Blizzard didn't make LoL.
<Gold_Demona> StarCraft 2 is really good.
<LittleBrony> Gears o War sucks
<LittleBrony> BAD
<Lasharus> Is that one 3rd person?
<teh_Tharassan> ?
<Lasharus> I thought GoW was an FPS?
<LittleBrony> Yes
<Ninjazz> Thats entirely opinion.
<SirGanjalf> Lasharus: Well it's more like First Person Slasher than hn's...
<d3rb> vanquish wasnt made by blizzard
<LittleBrony> It is an FPS 3rd person
<Lasharus> Mind you, never played it, so not really my most knowledgeable point.
<Ninjazz> People enjoy playing Gears of War.
<LittleBrony> Not me
<LittleBrony> I dont like the feel
<d3rb> fps 3rd person.....*brainexplode*
<Ninjazz> Okay.
<LittleBrony> and WAY too long of a story line
<Gold_Demona> How is it FPS (first person shooter) if it's Third Person?
<Lasharus> I've never really gone in for shooters anyway. They need to have either a phenomenal story or not take themselves seriously at all.
<Lasharus> (Bioshock and Serious Sam, respectively)
<LittleBrony> It is a TPS
<Gold_Demona> Doesn't that make it a Third Person Shooter?
<Gold_Demona> Yeah
<LittleBrony> a Third person shooter
<LittleBrony> But it is still OK but I dont like it
<Gold_Demona> Mass Effect has a Phenomenal story... if you ignor the ending of ME3. +p
<Gold_Demona> =P
<Ninjazz> Eh. The shooter genre is over saturated anyway.
<d3rb> ^
<Lasharus> It's not really my thing Gold_Demona.
<LittleBrony> I think Skyrim has changed gaming FOREVER
<Lasharus> I'm not going to say it's bad, because it isn't. It's just not my thing.
<LittleBrony> First FPS of its kind
<Lasharus> Hardly LittleBrony.
<Gold_Demona> Lasharus: Fair enough
<pony_5853> waht game i just arrivaed
<Lasharus> Morrowind and Oblivion were functionally identical.
<SirGanjalf> Lasharus: I'm not sure if story have anything to do with that from HoMMV. And besides graphic style and atmosphere seems pretty different from that in Heroes.
<d3rb> now i gotta disagree there LittleBrony, skyrim is good but i dont think its revolutionary
<Lasharus> Skyrim merely updated and upgraded the formula.
<LittleBrony> I dont know any other FPS games with only swords other than the other Elder Scrolls.
<LittleBrony> Magic does not count
<LittleBrony> as a gun
<EpicPwnTime3> bai gotta go 2 school
<Ninjazz> This has been ever since Daggerfall.
<Lasharus> That's why it's not exactly an FPS. I'm inclined to call it an FPRPG.
<Ninjazz> Skyrim was far from first.
<d3rb> lots and lots of games before it (at least the elder scroll serires) were simiklar
<EpicPwnTime3> bai everybody
<LittleBrony> Bai
<Ninjazz> Cya EpicPwnTime3.
<d3rb> later EpicPwnTime3
<Lasharus> Might & Magic did something similar, come to that.
<SirGanjalf> LittleBrony: I'll repeat: Dark Messiah of Might and Magic
<Ninjazz> ^
<LittleBrony> Never heard of it,any good?
<Lasharus> Dark Messiah was hardly the newest in the series SirGanjalf. :P
<Ninjazz> It's okay... :S
<Lasharus> And if memory serves, Dark Messiah was pretty bad.
<Bronies4evar> Next: My little pony. Later: Berry bitty adventures.
<teh_Tharassan> lol
<Lasharus> Also, SirGanjalf, to my knowledge, Dark Messiah plays in the same world as Heroes V.
<SirGanjalf> Lasharus: Idk if you can't count it as part of the M&M series, honestly
<Ninjazz> It's actually pretty good, I've heard. It got bogged down by bad reviews because of the problems people had playing it when it first came out.
<Lasharus> Given how badly they butchered the story in heroes V, I decided to avoid it.
<LittleBrony> What do you guys think of that new Care Bear cartoon and there claim for them to make a new type of bronys? They called em CareBuddys or something like that
<SirGanjalf> ^marketing
<Lasharus> Hasbro themselves spoke out against that advert LittleBrony. :P
<d3rb> ah////doubt it
<Saturn> 08,01WOOO! MY METAPOD *FINALLY* FUCKING EVOLVED
<Saturn> 08,01into a BUTTERFREE
<Lasharus> ...yay.
*Saturn 08,01is really getting into this game
<LittleBrony> Goodjob Saturn
<SirGanjalf> LittleBrony: Sounds a bit forced to me
<Gold_Demona> Personally, I play Heroes for the game itself and not for the story. I actually never paid any attention to the lore until Heroes V. =P
<teh_Tharassan> nice Saturn
<LittleBrony> It is
<LittleBrony> Lolz
<d3rb> which pokemon Saturn ?
<Bronies4evar> "Secret of my Excess" is showing now on The Hub.
<Ninjazz> Daayuum, Saturn! Sounds like serious bizness.
<Lasharus> That's why I quite enjoyed Heroes V regardless Gold_Demona. :P
<Lasharus> The game's pretty good. The story's an atrocity.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<teh_Tharassan> 0.0 *runs to change channel*
<Lasharus> If you can see the whole thing coming from level one onwards, it'd better be well-crafted.
<Gold_Demona> V was a big improvement to IV anyway
<Gold_Demona> IV was a pain to play
<Lasharus> Sadly, it's not, with poor voice acting and similar. :P
<Saturn> 08,01d3rb: red
<Saturn> 08,01i'd never played any pokemon game before yesterday
<d3rb> hell yeah, old school
<SirGanjalf> Lasharus: Anyway, I have Gold_Demona' attitude to
<Lasharus> I'm inclined to disagree. IV tried a lot of new things. Many backfired, but I like a lot of those features still.
<Ninjazz> Bronies4evar: First Sweet and Elite, now Secret of my Success? They are running a Rarity pony hour!
<d3rb> best one to start with
<teh_Tharassan> huzzah!
<Lasharus> Caravans were clever, the no-hero-armies were genius, I loved the hero partaking in the combat system...
<SirGanjalf> Lasharus: In HOMMIII i mostly played in single scenarios
<SirGanjalf> and there were tons of them*_*
<Lasharus> Sadly, the balance was shit, towns limited, and many things seemed unfinished.
<Bronies4evar> Ninjazz: It repeats at 11.30 am Eastern|8.30 am Pacific.
<Gold_Demona> V was the only one I ever played the campaign of. Otherwise I usually play hotseat mode
<SirGanjalf> ^
<Lasharus> Heroes IV suffered from a developer that was on the brink of death. :P
<Ninjazz> I wish I could catch it, Bronies4evar. But I think I'll just watch the episodes I have on my computer. :P
<Lasharus> And I'm a story nut, so I always go for campaigns.
<Gold_Demona> My husband and I have lots of fun playing hotseat maps together on V. =)
<Gold_Demona> We beat the crap out of computer players together
<Lasharus> Heroes V is definitely a fairly well-crafted instalment in the series. :)
<Lasharus> Like I said, I consider the story to be bad, but the gameplay is very solid now.
<Litwick> Saturn: get Black and White since you're a beginner to the series: it's easier, has great Pokemn, and it has a pretty good story.
<Lasharus> I love the skill system, like most of the factions, etc.
<d3rb> nah, red then silver or gold
<Gold_Demona> Lasharus: Oh God yeah, I remember the first time I stepped into my city and just staring at it. O_O
<Bronies4evar> Ninjazz: Wait till sunday. Derpy may come back.
<Ninjazz> mfw Pokemon has a story. :O
<Lasharus> As a magic-fanatic, I love that the Academy is bloody awesome. :P
<Lasharus> Care to explain that Bronies4evar?
<Lasharus> Because I'm confused.
<d3rb> or just play red, that sucker consumed so many hours when it came out
<Lasharus> Gold_Demona - you have no idea how long I sat staring at my first academy town. With a silly grin on my face. :P
<SirGanjalf> Necropolis is my beloved city in the series<3
<Ninjazz> I'm tellin' ya, Bronies4evar. It ain't ganna happen. They took her down. Why would they bring her back?
<Bronies4evar> Lasharus: Episode 214 is rerunning on The Hub this sunday at 8 am Eastern.
<Lasharus> Ah.
<Lasharus> I'm inclined to say that the name's not going to make a return.
<d3rb> it will be edited, money on it
<Gold_Demona> My first time playing I played as knights, but ALL the factions' cities are gorgeous to look at. :3
<Ninjazz> They already showed the "fixed" episode before.
<Ninjazz> She is not coming back.
<Lasharus> Agreed. Most are impractical as hell though.
<Lasharus> How the hell does the inferno town do ANYTHING? :P
<SirGanjalf> Who would know that episode would end up like Disney's WWII propaganda cartoons
<Lasharus> At least the Academy can go 'yeah, mages. We can teleport. Now shush.' :P
<Bronies4evar> Ninjazz: There is still hope! The power of love destroyed the changelings, so the imposter is gone too.
<pony_3110> а вам что:S
<SirGanjalf> Lost in the depths of the internet...
<Gold_Demona> Lasharus: LOL, I just figure they poof everywhere cuz they're demons. XP
<Ninjazz> Bronies4evar: Please don't take this the wrong way, man. I really do hate how this whole thing came down... But you have to let go.
<d3rb> yep
<pony_3110> а ты кто:|
<Lasharus> Frankly, it's what I dislike about Heroes VI - those town screens...
<Lasharus> Blegh.
<Bronies4evar> Fine. But I'm telling you, as in the 8-bit commercial, It could happen.
<Lasharus> Mind you, there's a LOT to dislike in heroes VI, right up to and including it being a horrendous bug-fest, but still. :P
<pony_3110> а я лера:S
<Gold_Demona> Lasharus: Yeah, I haven't been inclined to buy VI myself cuz it didn't impress me nearly as much. =/
<Ninjazz> Bronies4evar: They wouldn't risk it a second time if the first time cause such a mess.
<GilDash> Heh. 1337 o'clock. :)
<Ninjazz> Dat Leet.
<Ninjazz> Hey GilDash!
<d3rb> aww i only got 10:37 :(
<GilDash> 1337 o'clock AND a game showing. Wow, I have good timing. :D
<Lasharus> It has a few interesting ideas Gold_Demona. Sadly, it's blinkered and fettered by UbiSoft's singularly atrocious management.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Holla! :)
<Lasharus> Put it this way: They have that always-online tripe, right?
<pony_3110> а чем :S
<Lasharus> Their server went down on a friday evening. It wasn't fixed 'till monday afternoon. Know why?
<Gold_Demona> They do?
<Lasharus> Tech Support had buggered off for the weekend.
<Ninjazz> This story again. :D
<Lasharus> Am I that repetitive?
<Ninjazz> No.
<Lasharus> Phew.
<Ninjazz> I just remember the first time you told me it. :)
<GilDash> Lasharus: It's why I refuse to have anything to do with online only play, with the exception of multiplayer only titles.
<Lasharus> I know what you mean GilDash. I got Diablo III because Blizzard can at least be relied on to at least work hard to provide a decent service, bad launch day aside.
<pony_3110> нечево не мешно:[
<Ninjazz> Blue LOOT!
<Lasharus> UbiSoft's not seeing my money until they provide similar service or finally get rid of their always-online atrocity.
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, that's one thing I don't like about StarCraft 2. The fact that you HAVE to be online to play it, even if you're just doing the single-player campaign. =/
<GilDash> Lasharus: I think the launch day is understandable. Everyone and their mums were playing it that day. :D
<Lasharus> Yeah, that's why I'm not angry about it GilDash. :P
<Ninjazz> True.
<Lasharus> Half a day in advance, I said "Calling it now. 12:01 will be known as the great Diablo III server crash"
<Lasharus> Hey look, it happened. Big surprise. :P
<Gold_Demona> heh
<GilDash> It sucks on the other end too; If you internet goes down, you can't access your single-player portion of the game? What a load of-
<pony_3110> я не панела что ты говоришь :S
<Ninjazz> I still understand the craze for this game, though.
<Ninjazz> dont*
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Eh, it looks just like *another hack and slash.
<Ninjazz> Exactly.
<Lasharus> Most definitely GilDash.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: It's probably because it's predecessors were so popular.
<Gold_Demona> Ninjazz: From what I see, most of the people excited over it are people who were already fans of the first two games.
<Lasharus> It's more aggravating if the servers die on the company's end. You're fine, but you still can't play.
<pony_3110> пока:S
<Ninjazz> Perhaps. Most people I know that are crazy for it LOVED Diablo 2.
<Lasharus> Again, why I don't mind Blizzard's using it as much as UbiSoft - Blizzard usually provides solid servers, as opposed to UbiSoft.
<GilDash> Lasharus: True. Still, either way is uneccessary.
<Lasharus> True enough.
<MaidSurge> :O Who's playing Diablo?
<Kid_Cobalt> pony_3110: Доброе утро ^-^
<Ninjazz> Wrek.
<SirGanjalf> Well, Diablo III was released, Max Payne 3 is out today, now i'm waiting for E3 and Valve's conference(and new Hitman)
<Gold_Demona> Valve needs to prove it can count to 3. =P
<SirGanjalf> ^
<SirGanjalf> ^THIS
<Ninjazz> I'm waiting for Gaven to announce Orange Box 2.
<GilDash> I'm going to wait to buy a new PC, when I start working, *then* I'll start going for games. :D
<Litwick> SirGanjalf: Valve counting to three? Preposterous
<Lasharus> It'd be about bloody time Gold_Demona. :P
<Ninjazz> Biggest troll ever.
<MaidSurge> I'm not interested in any coming release right now :/
<diddutz> Gold_Demona: You want Portal 3 and L4D3? xD
<Lasharus> I want L5D7
<Lasharus> (Thank you Zero Punctuation)
<Gold_Demona> I want Half-Life 2 Episode 3! Or at least Half-Life 3 if it finishes Half-Life 2's story.
<Sumica> 00,10comeing soon™ Hl2ep2.2222222
<Ninjazz> I'm telling you guys. Orange Box 2. It's perfect!
<GilDash> Lasharus: Godesses, I haven't seen that series in over 2 years. Yahtzee still going strong, eh? :D
<SirGanjalf> Litwick: I can see Gabe in my mind... entering the stage... and announcing... Ricochet 2!!!
<Ninjazz> They got to play along the joke and Gabe still get to make sequels.
<Spell-of-Gaming> May I link a video? :P
<Sumica> 00,10Ricochet was an awsome game
<GilDash> Sumica: Half Life Ep. Pi. Requiring you to drill yourself in the head at the end. :D
<Lasharus> As ever GilDash.
<MaidSurge> I've got the Orange Box, but I still haven't played anything but TF2 out of it :(
<d3rb> MaidSurge: :O
<SirGanjalf> MaidSurge: WHY
<d3rb> play hl2 then portal dude, damn awesome games
<GilDash> I don't think I've ever played a Valve game. That will change when I get a new PC. :)
<Gold_Demona> MadiSurge: The other games in the Orange Box are equally awesome.
<diddutz> MaidSurge: http://images.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw2610-13280991906263.jpg
<SlurryMoon> 3soooo....
<SlurryMoon> 3I went to bed at 5 and woke up at 7
<SirGanjalf> or even Portal first - it's short, but damn, so brilliant
<SlurryMoon> 3How is everyone :3
<Gold_Demona> I bought the Orange Box for Portal, and I ended up playing Half-Life 2 just because I happened to have it. =P
<GilDash> SlurryMoon: That sounds like a good nap... :D
<Ninjazz> Yeah, your' up early, SlurryMoon.
<d3rb> great SlurryMoon
<teh_Tharassan> doin ok SlurryMoon
<MaidSurge> My old laptop chugged on Tf2, I don't wanna know what it would have done on HL2 or Portal
<d3rb> you play hl 1 Gold_Demona ?
<Ninjazz> I'm doing fine, btw.
<Litwick> Wait, 5 in the morning or afternoon?
<Kid_Cobalt> SlurryMoon: I went to bed at like 10 and woke up at 8 something. And good how are you sir?
<SlurryMoon> 3hehehe, awesome x3
<MaidSurge> And my current netbook can't handel facebook games :D
<GilDash> MaidSurge: I know that feel. :D
<Gold_Demona> d3rb: I've tried multiple times to play through HL1. My comp runs it too smoothly though. The camera kills me. @_@
<Om> Morning Bronystate.
<GilDash> Om: Morning, Ommy. ;)
<Ninjazz> Hey, Om.
<d3rb> too smooth? as in too fast?
<Kid_Cobalt> Om: Как поживаете ^-^
<diddutz> MaidSurge: The first portal game shouldn't be consuming that much resources, there are only small, closed levels
<GilDash> Kid_Cobalt: Why the Russian? :|
<Om> GilDash: Ello GilDash, Ninjazz. Not sure what you said Kid_Cobalt
<Gold_Demona> d3rb: Kinda... It's not running faster than it should. As in the animations and audio work fine, but the camera is WAY too sensitive.
<Viri> 14I just assisted to the creepiest thing ever
<Viri> 14o.o
<MaidSurge> GilDash: so I'm saving money to be able to get a PC, once I move out of my parents' house :D
<Viri> 14I put some pasta in a plate
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Viri> 14this plate starts cracking
<Viri> 14o_O
<d3rb> ah ok, should be able to tweak that
<HyperMetalLugia> weirdd
<Viri> 14wtf
<Wrek> 05back
<Viri> 14-1 plate
<HyperMetalLugia> did it break
<Viri> 14.w.
<GilDash> MaidSurge: I start my job on 28th and that's the first thing I'm going to save up for. I'm going to build it myself. :)
<Viri> 14of course o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> fail
<HyperMetalLugia> :c
<Gold_Demona> I've tried lowering the mouse sensitivity, but to no avail. =/
<Viri> 14there was a huge creak
<HyperMetalLugia> only in italy
<Viri> 14then another one
<Viri> 14xD
<Kid_Cobalt> GilDash: clever clever pony ^-^ haha I only know greetings in russian -lol- so I liek to keep my russian fresh by practicing the speech from time to time.
<d3rb> really...thats weird
<Viri> 14it was a very old plate though
<GilDash> MaidSurge: I just bought a car and insurance recently, so I'm all prepped to go. :)
<HyperMetalLugia> aww
<Gold_Demona> d3rb: It's a really good game though. I've mostly been watching it by way of Freeman's Mind on YouTube. lol =P
<the_real_pony_1604> you need to get an extremely cheap mouse with horrible sensitivity
<GilDash> Kid_Cobalt: It's in cyrillic. That's a dead giveaway. :D
<MaidSurge> I can't build computers GilDash, but I know someone who's very good at getting good ones
<Gold_Demona> It's not the mouse's fault. It's my computer for being too awesome. lol XD
<Kid_Cobalt> GilDash: you have know idea how many people sometimes think its latin or some kind of hebrew because they have never seen cyrillic text before.
<MaidSurge> So Wrek, will you eventually find the secret level? :D
<SirGanjalf> Kid_Cobalt: How can one mistake cyrillic with latin6_9
<Om> Kid_Cobalt: Hevrew is way more cirly.
<GilDash> MaidSurge: I've got my dad who does that for a living. He's IT at a stationery company, but he does all the serves and such too. I've got a brother on an IT course at college, and he's done moduels on stripping and replacing components. Also, I'm quite tech savvy anyways, so I should be able to manage. :)
<Kid_Cobalt> SirGanjalf: you tell me.
<GilDash> Kid_Cobalt: Latin is ABC. :D
<SirGanjalf> ^
<Kid_Cobalt> Om: dually noted.
<SirGanjalf> Latin uses THESE LETTERS
<Kid_Cobalt> GilDash: is it.
<Sylandest> morning, everypony!
<GilDash> Sylandest: Holla! :)
<Gold_Demona> lol
<d3rb> hey Sylandest
<Kid_Cobalt> Sylandest: Как поживаете
<Sylandest> how is everypony this morning?
<Gold_Demona> Hi Sylandest
<GilDash> Sylandest: Great! Yourself?
<MaidSurge> GilDash: nice! I'll be sure to get a decent graphic card too :D
<Kid_Cobalt> Sylandest: Спасибо, хорошо
<Sylandest> GilDash: Slightly sleepy, having just woken up, hehe
<GilDash> MaidSurge: Please, I'll be getting two at least. Just because. :D
<Om> Sylandest: You can do it!
<Sylandest> Kid_Cobalt: I have no idea what you said, but good morning to you too! lol
<GilDash> Sylandest: Here, have a coffee. :)
*GilDash hoofs over coffee to Sylandest.
<MaidSurge> GilDash: does it significantly enhance the games' performance? :D
<GilDash> Kid_Cobalt: Word of advice: Foreign isn't tolerated here. :D
<Sylandest> Om: what can I do? Am I doing something? 6_9
<Sylandest> GilDash: tyvm :)
<Kid_Cobalt> Sylandest: I said Hi, how are you.
<Om> Sylandest: You're waking up. Its allll in the head.
<GilDash> MaidSurge: Yeah. I get to one-up my friend and his rig too, so that's all good. :D
<Gold_Demona> Well, I gotta go do my morning workout. See y'all later, bronies.
<the_baby_police_depa> hi guys
<d3rb> later Gold_Demona
<GilDash> Gold_Demona: Have fun. :)
<Kid_Cobalt> GilDash: That sounds somewhat offensive crass ignorant and a bit racist. Care to rephrase that?
<SirGanjalf> bye Gold_Demona
<GilDash> Kid_Cobalt: Just the rules. English only. :)
<MaidSurge> GilDash: being a multi-system videogamer is dispendious :D
<Sylandest> Om: my head says I should still be in bed...hehehe
<the_baby_police_depa> wheres crazycherry gildash?
<d3rb> goodnight/goodmorning all, I'm off
<GilDash> MaidSurge: That's why I'm going back to my system of choice. I started on PC, lost myself along the way, now I'll be getting money rolling in I think it's about time I get back in. With a bang!
<Om> Sylandest: Don't let GilDash know that.
<SirGanjalf> k, bye for now
<GilDash> Om: Ommy, I don't have to bed *everypony.* ;)
<GilDash> SirGanjalf: See ya. :)
<Bronies4evar> It's almost 9 am Bronystate now.
<Om> GilDash: Well arent you civil.
<Kid_Cobalt> GilDash: yeah, well keep to yourself.
<Sylandest> Om: I shall do my best to keep it from his vision...hehe
<MaidSurge> GilDash: I'll still keep my consoles. I'll just use my netbook for an eventual job!
<GilDash> Om: It's a point of pride. :)
<GilDash> Kid_Cobalt: Aw, no fun! :D
<GilDash> Sylandest: I see you! :)
<GilDash> MaidSurge: Fair does. :)
<Kid_Cobalt> GilDash: Dont toy with me kid..
<Sylandest> Gildash: *emerges from pillow fort* curses! foiled again!
<GilDash> Sylandest: Oh, you so silly. :D
<GilDash> Kid_Cobalt: But it's fun fooling around. :)
<Sylandest> GilDash: I be a sily filly all the time
<Sylandest> *silly
<GilDash> Sylandest: I know. :)
<Bronies4evar> It's twenty fifty-eight now.
<ofna01> a little silly keeps the crazy away
<Kid_Cobalt> GilDash: seriously. I find you very annoying. and the fact that ive been telling everyone good morning and you decide to pull otu the rule book on me because of that aggravates me. I dont like you. Do not talk to me. I cant simplify it more than that.
<Sylandest> ofna01: agreed, hehe
<MaidSurge> GilDash: If I have to translate stuff I'll be needing a mobile laptop :D
<Ninjazz> Uh oh.
<Om> ofna01: I thought those two went hand0in-hand?
<GilDash> Kid_Cobalt: Well, I'm sorry. Just didn't want you to get kicked. I'll try not to be so polite next time. :)
<Ninjazz> I come back to arguing.
<Phase4> i have learned the ways of the streamers
<Phase4> but not tonight
<Bronies4evar> It's a Friday morning at 9/8c/6p. Berry Bitty Adventures is now showing on THe Hub.

<MaidSurge> Ninjazz: awww :D
<Phase4> what is this i dont even
<Kid_Cobalt> GilDash: see I hate sarcasm. and I doubt ill get kicked for saying good morning. And if I did I dont think i want to be apart of a place that kicks people for saying good morning you werent being polite you were being a thorn in my side.
<Ninjazz> LOL Yeah! :D

<N4X> I never recognized you before SlurrMoon...but I have to agree Octavia is awesome :D
<Ninjazz> Sorry, GilDash. Not exactly allowd to drink yet. :S
<GilDash> Om: Oh Ommy, keep talking. ;)

<GilDash> Ninjazz: Well, what about a nice cup of juice? Everypony likes juice! :)
<ofna01> or Cider
<Om> GilDash: Nuh uh, clandestine.
*ofna01 gives everyone cider

<Airpuff> GilDash: You never mind that now do ya? xD

<Angel_Espy|College> 13that's how I remember that symbol
<Angel_Espy|College> 13|D
<GilDash> Airpuff: No, I would embrace her gladly... I wonder if she'd like or dislike that... Maybe I should plan this out...
<Viri> 14lol
<Ninjazz> GilDash: It's been around... 4 days since I last came on here. I think I've failed that duty a long time ago. :(
<GilDash> Sylandest: We're trying to get the sound-proofing installed quickly, I swear. :$
<Viri> 14oh

<GilDash> Ninjazz: Tsk tsk, that's why I've felt so liberal recently then. ;)
<Ninjazz> Cya N4X! Take care. Congratz on the kittens too!
<GilDash> N4X: See ya. :)
<Sylandest> GilDash: Well, so long as I don't hear "No, not in there!" anymore, I suppose I'm content for now
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I've failed, it seems. :'(
<GilDash> Sylandest: Hey, that's only happened twice! :$
<Viri> 14"how much do you bet that, by turning this book's pages randomly, I will always get a pair number?"
<Viri> 14just 4-5 people got it
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Don't worry. I've got tapes. ;)
<Sylandest> GilDash: haha! XD
<Viri> 14others were like "OMFG ARE YOU A WIZARD"
<Phase4> there is a lot of fighting in this game
<GilDash> Ninjazz: You can view them at your leisure. :)
<Om> Yuuuup. Sstill confused. Oh well guna play with my pony~
<Ninjazz> Tapes? Daayuum. You're willing to take extra steps.
<GilDash> Om: Come and play with this pony, Ommy. ;)
<Ninjazz> Very well. Hand them over. Let
<Ninjazz> Where was Gondor when the enter key became so sensitive?
<Sylandest> GilDash: Now now, behave yourself. We don't want Cherry getting jealous, now do we?
<Ninjazz> Let me see what you've been up to, GilDash?*
<Om> GilDash: As long as you don't try to clean everything.
<GilDash> Sylandest: What she doesn't hear won't hurt her. ;)
<GilDash> Om: I was thinking more along the lines of draining, dear Ommy. ;)
<Sylandest> GilDash: you's a sneaky pony, GilDash
*GilDash hooves over to Ninjazz personal tapes.
<Angel_Espy|College> 13LOL
<GilDash> Sylandest: Hey, we have a mutual agreement. ;)

<Angel_Espy|College> 13you should've made people actually bet money so you'd be rich
<Angel_Espy|College> 13:D
<Ninjazz> This is alot of tapes.
<Om> GilDash: That one wasn't even subtle. xD
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Of course. These are the dirctor's cuts! :)
<Viri> 14x3
<Sylandest> GilDash: I can tell, judging by the Rarity face you make at the end of every sentence...haha
<Ninjazz> Dear Lord I have my work cut out for me...
<GilDash> Om: I can't be subtle all the time. Sometimes I need to bludgeon my way through, just to make sure. :D
<Airpuff> GilDash: Always use the rarity face when you're implying something ;)
<Lyncast> back from basic,
<Lyncast> and i know none of you :(
<GilDash> Sylandest: Yeah, I do abuse Rarity a lot... Oh my...
<Om> GilDash: Did I teach you that :3
<Sylandest> GilDash: Don't tell Spike that, he might get angry, hehehe
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Morning regulars
<GilDash> Airpuff: No, because then it makes people freak out when I don't. They can't tell is serious. You see?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> although probably afternoon already for some of you
<Lyncast> SuperBrony64|Zzz
<Airpuff> ... xD
<Airpuff> If you say so.
<GilDash> Om: I think I might've learnt a few lessons from you...
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I didn't just hear you say that... :|
<Om> Ninjazz: You probably did.
<Lyncast> i know none of you :(
<SlurryMoon> 3afternoon? That's silly, it's always 5 am in BronyState

<Lyncast> thats right, i am :3
<Airpuff> freak*
<GilDash> Lyncast: We're very friendly... ;)
<Ninjazz> Om: You know what I mean!
<GilDash> Airpuff: Yeah, you really should tie me down when newbies visit. :D
<Angel_Espy|College> 13BY THE WAY
*Sylandest ties GilDash down
<Airpuff> GilDash: Ahaha idm i like seeing how they react xD
<Angel_Espy|College> 13Don't you still owe me a Touhou replay at some point? :P
<Sylandest> you said it, not me
*Angel_Espy|College 13runs
<GilDash> Airpuff: Of course, that might excite me more...
<RX-78-SweetieBot> okay...
<GilDash> Sylandest: Oh, you naughty pony... ;)
<Om> Ninjazz: Perhaps, but most people hate when I am too literal. Thus I like being too literal
*GilDash trots up to Sylandest but falls short.
<Viri> 14ohh, right :P
<Sylandest> GilDash: O///O
<GilDash> Sylandest: ... No fair. :(
<Hawkie> Angel_Espy|College!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Hawkie> ANGEL ESPEON
<Hawkie> where
<Sylandest> GilDash: well, you did say to tie you up good...you can thank Applejack for the rope lessons
<Ninjazz> Om: I only hope you don't get into a situation you regret being in.
<Angel_Espy|College> 13Hawkieeeefloof :3
*Airpuff lifts up GilDash and hugs "there there, take it easy now, its to early to go that far "
<Hawkie> did you get the 5000 questions from

<Airpuff> GilDash: Well, you're doing a good job already ahaha
<GilDash> Sylandest: Oh, so Applejack's good with rope, eh? ;)
<GilDash> Sylandest: You would know this how...?
*Airpuff pomf
*Ninjazz watches tapes with a pokerface
<Angel_Espy|College> 13http://5000questionsur.livejournal.com/?skip=40 <-- here, if you haven't found it already
<Angel_Espy|College> 13xD
<Sylandest> GilDash: Well, of course she is-waaaait, I know what you're doing.
<Airpuff> ... Dont say such about AJ GilDash .....
<Airpuff> I like Aj...
<Airpuff> xD
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I'd turn down the volume if I were you...
<Angel_Espy|College> 13I'm officially 1/5 of my way through all the questions ;w;
<Angel_Espy|College> 13don't really work through it that often though
<Ninjazz> Nothing to fear but fear itself, GilDash. *pokerface*
<Lyncast> do we still get permabanned for talking about shed.mov?
<Ninjazz> I don't think so... :S
<Ninjazz> But still shouldn't discuss it.
<GilDash> Lyncast: We can talk about it to an extent. Linking it is forbidden though, I do believe.
<Airpuff> oh.. its that sick thing...
<Sylandest> GilDash: my knowledge of ropes from Applejack is strictly professional, tyvm
<Airpuff> I prefer not talking about it..
<Ninjazz> It's still in the rule book.
<Kammerjunk> I remember doing the Time Warp!
<Viri> 14I will do that replay asap
<Airpuff> Sylandest: yeah yeah. thats what they all say ;)
<GilDash> Lyncast: At least, I *think* we can talk about it. I might be mistaken. I'm sure there's something in the rules, I'd go check just to make sure. :)
<Lyncast> fantastic
<Viri> 14I need to practice a bit with my controller though
<Viri> 14it has been ages xD
<Lyncast> meh, ive read the rules 9 weeks ago
<Lyncast> those are the rules i go by.
<GilDash> Sylandest: Do you really expect *me* to believe that?
<Angel_Espy|College> 13Lol take as much time as you want, I was just giving you a little reminder :P
<Angel_Espy|College> 13I completely forgot about it myself until now xD
<Sylandest> Airpuff and GilDash: O///O It is! *waves hooves defensively*
<Viri> 14it will the the best replay you ever saw
<Lyncast> Wrek!

*Viri runs
<GilDash> Sylandest: 'Sides, you need chains to really keep me occupied...
*GilDash slips out of Sylandest's ropes.
*Airpuff smiles at Sylandest before poking GilDash saying "You believe this?" xD
<ofna01> Guys,go easy on Kid_Cobalt, alright?
<GilDash> Sylandest: See? :)
<Kid_Cobalt> ofna01: ehhhhhh.....
<Whiskra> fuck it im mad now
<Sylandest> GilDash: Duly noted. I will have to remember that the next time you let down your guard
<Kid_Cobalt> ofna01: id rather not disclose my buissness with everypony
<ofna01> im not saying anything else,Kid,thats your business
<Whiskra> so I beat a bunch of mobs
<Om> ofna01: I know, but we cant let him get bored with us now can we?
<GilDash> Sylandest: Who said I let down my guard? ;)
<Sylandest> Airpuff: *sputters and tries to defend himself*
<ofna01> was just tellin them to ease off
<Sylandest> GilDash: you...but...I...agh!
<GilDash> Guys, enough with Kid_Cobalt. Just treat him like a regular, okay?
<Whiskra> dropped lots of good loot, yellows and pages of blacksmithing, but 2 guys were plagued/vampiric so they didnt die
<Angel_Espy|College> 13I'M SURE IT WILL
<Angel_Espy|College> 13;3
<Om> GilDash: I was ._.
*Airpuff Giggles at Sylandest very well.. "I <<Believe>> you..." =P
<Whiskra> took me 10 min to kill them, when they were dead, all the loot were gone
<GilDash> Airpuff: Hey, that's a good song!
<Angel_Espy|College> 13My current goal is to beat EoSD on hard mode
<Airpuff> GilDash: xD
<Viri> 14:O
<Sylandest> Airpuff: *blushes and huffs as he looks away* Well, its the truth. Ask AJ yourself if you don't believe me
<Angel_Espy|College> 13capable of getting to the last stage, but I always have a habit of starting off well and then completely messing up later on xD
<GilDash> Airpuff: ~This is the way I pray / Living just isn't hard enough / Burn me alive inside / Living my life's not hard enough / Take everything away... ~
<Angel_Espy|College> 13but LOL on my very first attempt I somehow got through the entire Patchouli fight without losing any lives or bombs
<Angel_Espy|College> 13which will probably never happen again xD
<Om> Sylandest: Something ilicit going on?
<GilDash> Sylandest: Oh don't worry, we will. ;)
<Airpuff> o.o never heard it GilDash .. i think
<Viri> 14I tried beating Imperishable NIght in lunatic
<Viri> 14I almost did that
<Sylandest> Om: nah, they're just poking fun at me because I learned rope tying from Applejack
<Viri> 14stupid bunny-girl <w<
<Airpuff> What is the name of the song and artist behind it? =P
<Angel_Espy|College> 13I used to think IN was the easiest game for me
<GilDash> Om: Can you believe we'd take that suggestively?
<Angel_Espy|College> 13but it's been so long since I played it I now think it's pretty difficult LOL
<Om> Sylandest: Oh so you made a slip up didja.
<Airpuff> Om ;)
<Angel_Espy|College> 13and suddenly I find EoSD really easy in normal mode when I used to think of it as one of the hardest games for me
<Angel_Espy|College> 13;w;
<Sylandest> Om: I did...and GilDash leapt like a rabid beast, hehe
<Om> GilDash: I can think of anything sugjestive about it at all.
<Viri> 14xD
<GilDash> Airpuff: Wow, I just managed to get the lyrics of Prayer and Believe mixed up. :D
<Airpuff> GilDash: And that thing about AJ.. is pretty hard not to think suggestive about too xD
<Om> Sylandest: GilDash isn't rabid, no. Its far worse.
<GilDash> Sylandest: Yeah, it's like controlled rabid. Or something. I dunno. :D
<Ninjazz> For someone who is named after a ship, you certainly do get the appropriate response, GilDash. :P
<Airpuff> The communitys "Tease" GilDash
<Sylandest> Airpuff: Strictly professional! I'm telling you! Yes, one works up a sweat, but that's expected out in the field! *covers mouth* oh bugger, I've said too much again
<MaidSurge> GilDash: oh you, always screwing with people :D
<twilight_sprinkler> the chat seems to be an appropriate condition for me to link surprise buttsecks song ft. RD
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Funnily enough, I only support the ship one-sided. :D
<Ninjazz> From which side?
<GilDash> Airpuff: And I tease them right back. ;)
<Om> Sylandest: That slip was intentional.
<Airpuff> Sylandest: You're enjoying this arrent'cha? ^^
<GilDash> MaidSurge: I think that's become the standard. :D
<Ninjazz> And hey twilight_sprinkler.
*Sylandest sighs
<Sylandest> you caught me, Om, Airpuff
<twilight_sprinkler> hoi Ninjazz
<Om> Try to be more careful when, tying your knots, so to speak.
<GilDash> Sylandest: Ohh, the thought of you and AJ, hot and sweaty... all tied up...
<MaidSurge> GilDash: that's why I find you so funny :D
<GilDash> Om: ... Ponys don't have knots. ;)
<Sylandest> GilDash: O///O
<Sylandest> Om: I shall remember so
<GilDash> MaidSurge: Good! I find me funny too! :D
<Om> GilDash: Who is being literal now?
<GilDash> Om: Okay, you got me. :D
<Airpuff> Sylandest: dont tease the pervs xD
<Sylandest> Airpuff: But its fun! haha
<GilDash> Airpuff: Hey, I'm not a perv! I'm... promiscuous...
<MaidSurge> GilDash: all I'd be thinking would be "EWW, HORSE SWEAT"
<Airpuff> GilDash: Ahaha ofc promiscuous.... xD
<Om> GilDash: I'm starting to rub off on you. We cant have me taint your precous sanity can we?
<GilDash> Om: What would you suggest, Ommykins?
<Om> GilDash: Suggestions really arent my thing.
<GilDash> MaidSurge: Yeah, well... sweat means you've worked 'em hard! ;)
<Airpuff> MaidSurge: suggestively thinking is your friend xD
<GilDash> Om: No, I think we've quite established suggestions are my forte. :)
<Sylandest> GilDash: I work too hard at times if we're going by sweating amounts
<Om> GilDash: Aye.
<MaidSurge> Yeah well, I like to think how to defuse anything mildly suggestive :D
<Airpuff> Sylandest: =O Now this is getting dangerous
<GilDash> Sylandest: Oh my. Sounds like you do a very good job. ;)
<Sylandest> Airpuff: haha! I may have stepped too far with that one, true
<Airpuff> Sylandest: As long as the mods dont mind it xDD
<Sylandest> GilDash: you realize now, every time I see you type "oh my" I hear george takei?
<GilDash> If I were a pegasus...
<Ninjazz> Ugh. It's too early for me to be this tired...
<GilDash> Sylandest: What makes you think it wasn't intended in that exact manner? ;)

<Viri> 14o.o
<Sylandest> GilDash: er...good point. Especially considering the wing-pomf'ing thing

<Airpuff> Sylandest: Yeah... *giggles*
<Om> Sylandest: yea, you don't have enough class for Twi anyhow.
<Sylandest> GilDash: the timing of your comment...haha
<Sylandest> Om: Yeah, you're right...she's way out of my league anyway...
<Airpuff> Om: A pony with so many books must be awfully lonely at nights ;)
<Om> Airpuff: You'd be supprised how much company books provide.
*twilight_sprinkler beats Airpuff with a chair
<Ninjazz> Class ain't really Twi's thing anyway.
<GilDash> Om: You'd be surprised just what you'd learn if you took your nose out of those dusty old books. ;)
*Airpuff is being beat with a chair. =O
<twilight_sprinkler> Twi is quite classy generally Ninjazz
<Om> Ninjazz: Twi is all class.
<Sylandest> Airpuff: books make for great company, what are you talking about? *forever alone*
<Airpuff> I'd say Rarity is class Twi is madness brain
<Ninjazz> I think not. She is more adorkable.
<Om> GilDash: I like my dose nice and dusty.
<Ninjazz> Rarity is class.

<Sumica> 00,10No responce is sent, you just recive the news letter.
<Sylandest> GilDash: no, nothing at all is happening! It's sincerely just late night studies of ancient romantic poetic texts that need translating!
<Kammerjunk> Times have changed. And we've often rewound the clock, since the Puritans got a shock when they landed on Plymouth Rock.
<Om> Airpuff: All you need to know is I have this spice.
<Sumica> 00,10give me the e-mail in pm and i will check to see if it's been added yet.
*Airpuff grabs some BBQ Hula hoops from GilDash
<GilDash> Sylandest: Poetic texts, huh? I bet you're both enjoying those. ;)
<Airpuff> Om ahaha
<Airpuff> omg Sylandest xD
<Sylandest> GilDash: well, they do make for good reading, though she keeps some of the books out of sight for some reason...
<Airpuff> Suggestive texts are suggestive

<GilDash> Sylandest: Maybe she wants you to read them... secretly... ;)

*GilDash spins User0.

<Sylandest> Om: perhaps both? XD

<GilDash> Om: That's a trap, isn't it. :)
<Om> Spring it and find out.
<GilDash> Sylandest: Hooves full of what though?
<Ninjazz> Diablo 3 is famous for its grind. I was prepared for it.
<GilDash> Om: I've learnt from long gaming sessions that you should never spring the trap. :D
<Giger4444> What is the main difference between Diablo 2 and 3? I see its the exact same concept, but with more expanded skill tree.
<Sylandest> GilDash: Why, books of course, what else- O///O I see where you went with that...
<Om> Hmm, there are more than one way to set a trigger.
<GilDash> Giger4444: Graphics? :D
<Om> Giger4444: Skill trees are what make these games.
<GilDash> Om: There's more than one way to avoid a trap. ;)
<Giger4444> GilDash: so nothing major difference gameplay-wise?
<GilDash> Sylandest: Why is that? My question was entirely innocent.
<Om> GilDash: Oh? Enlighten me.
<GilDash> Giger4444: I've no idea. Ive never played either. :D

<GilDash> Sylandest: Basement... Barn... Hmm... ;)
<Sumica> 00,10yeah

<RainBroDash> 10:/ would check mine for you, but I'm always on EU
<ofna01> i've never been gifted a game...... :(

<Kandarihu> Er, no. It's giving a Server Not Found
<Ninjazz> Huh. Seems so.
<RainBroDash> 10Wrek, SC2? Also I'd play Diablo with you but I don't have it / can't run it
<Sumica> 00,10some places are uneffected every one else is gting 3007 errors when loging in
<Sylandest> Alright everypony, I need to wash up, so I'll be back in a few. GilDash, don't have too much fun

<RainBroDash> 10but Wrek I'm shit :D
<Ninjazz> Blizz is probably getting flooded.
<Sylandest> GilDash: That's what I'm worried about...XD
<Sumica> 00,10yeah kinda figured that
<RainBroDash> 10I can connect to game servers though
<GilDash> Sylandest: I'll be a good pony, you'll see!
<User0> There are so many bad reviews of D3 just because the servers are crashing
*GilDash is a good pony.
<User0> Like a 2-1 ratio of bad to good
<Om> GilDash: Good is also relevent to what is considered evil.
<RainBroDash> 10it's not even a wednesday, so it's not maintenance. They'd also have a redirect page even for emergency maintenance
<GilDash> User0: To be fair, the inability to play a game is a good sign of how "bad" it is. :D

<GilDash> Om: You don't think I'm evil, do you Om? :(
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<Kandarihu> Could it be a DDOS attack?
<RainBroDash> 10it -could- yes
<User0> Still, unstable servers for the first week or so is kinda... expected...
<Kandarihu> No, I'd be getting timeouts on the US server if it were.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Kandarihu: I would doubt it, but it coudl be
<Om> GilDash: I belive
<Om> woops
<Om> Derped and hit enter
<User0> if the servers are still crashing by week 3, that's different
<GilDash> Om: Try that again. :)
<Giger4444> what is the issue with the servers? they didnt expect this much server load?
<Sumica> 00,10So it seems the launch day errors came back last night
<Ninjazz> They never do.
<GilDash> Giger4444: Either that or someone's messed up settings somewhere. :D
<Spazturtle> Giger4444: The did but they decided not to incress server capaciy
<Om> GilDash: I belive "use a ball gag" and "don't for froget the cat tail wip" are some verbatim I found quite frightening. But it was PrincessLuna who said it. So I don't know if I shoudl have been suppriesd.
<GilDash> Spazturtle: F'in idiots. >_<
<Spazturtle> Once you've paid they have your money
<Sumica> 00,10however no clue what killed everything
<Giger4444> Spazturtle: wtf? I dont understand why they wouldn't.
<GilDash> Om: I don't see how that'd make "me" evil, only the dear Princess.
<Sumica> 00,10not sure a ddos of that size is realy possable
<SirGanjalf> Kandarihu: DDoS attack is basically overloading servers with to many entry attempts. So, yeah it kinda is:D
<Sumica> 00,10they are not limited to one system
<Kandarihu> Well, the game servers are fine. I just tried connecting to battle.net on Starcraft, and it's fine
<Spazturtle> Giger4444: It would cut into there proffit, they have peoples money now why bother
<Om> GilDash: Oh yes my mistake, because you obviously were oposed to the idea. xD
<Sumica> 00,10negitive Kandarihu
<Giger4444> Spazturtle: is increasing capacity THAT expensive?
<Spazturtle> nope
<GilDash> Om: Oh totally. I'd never take the... where did I put them anyway?
<Kandarihu> I'm pretty skeptical about this being a DDOS attack, too.
<Sumica> 00,10as I said the issues with games are regonal. Some can connect some cant.
<Om> Har har :D
<Om> I'm thining about Buying Diablo III when all this rubbish has been sorted out. Or if.
<Kandarihu> The US server is giving me a Server Not Found error, so it probably isn't a DDOS attack, unless the EU servers were DDOSed, and Blizzard took down the US servers to make sure that isn't targetted as well.
<GilDash> Om: If. If is good. :D
<Airpuff> Backs =o

<SirGanjalf> Highly doubt it's DDoS - just too many people trying to lo in at once; it happened before
<GilDash> Ryunosuke: Yar har, fiddle-de-dee...
<babypolicedepartment> what is this?
<Om> Kandarihu: I know, but it took them a good mont when WoW cataclysm launched. And that wasnt even a new game.
<SirGanjalf> *log
<Ryunosuke> if I want an online game, I have EVE, if I want a singleplayer game, I dont want to be on the internet
<SirGanjalf> ^
<GilDash> Ryunosuke: I concur. :)
<Om> GilDash: Are we taking turns now?
<babypolicedepartment> whats this game?
<Airpuff> Ryunosuke: .. hmpf.. thats one way to look at it
<GilDash> Om: I would be okay with that. ;)
<Ninjazz> Nothing special.
<VioletGreySha> welcome Ninjazz :D
<Ninjazz> :D Dat VioletGreySha!
<GilDash> Airpuff: What other way of looking at it is there?
<Ninjazz> Thank you. :)
<VioletGreySha> :3
<GilDash> VioletGreySha: Holla! :)
<babypolicedepartment> ohhh......army of skeletons.....how typical
<VioletGreySha> hay :D
<Airpuff> GilDash: Well, there are games which can do bouth..
<Airpuff> GilDash: Have bouth a good online and offline gameplay.
<Airpuff> Ofc.. rare..
<GilDash> Airpuff: Yeah, but you shouldn't have to rely on the internet for a non-internet related gametype. It's just stupid. >_<
<babypolicedepartment> my laptop CANT play any games at all
<Airpuff> GilDash: Ofc i agree with that, if its offline it should be offline xDD
<GilDash> Airpuff: That's what I mean. I'm all for online for online... Kind stupid without that. :D
<Giger4444> what??? you have to log onto battlenet to actually play the singleplayer game? thats effed up!
<GilDash> Giger4444: Welcome to Blizzard! :D
<Ryunosuke> oh, and fyi, I pirate all the time, Low-sec in EVE is great for pirating, I get all kinds of loot from dumbasses flying frieghters and non-cloaky haulers in lowsec :)
<Om> Pfft, knowing Blizz they might make you buy an offline mode >.<
<Ninjazz> I am wondering how we aren't freaking about this more than we should.
<babypolicedepartment> uhh what game r we talking about again?
<Giger4444> I thought the upheaval was because people couldnt play online...
<Kandarihu> You know, requiring online-only gameplay is an effective anti-piracy mechanism. They might not be willing to give that up unless they can be sure that they can get more sales by allowing offline play.
<Spazturtle> You can get kicked forom single player for having a higher ping or for idling
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Because we're used to the gameing industry pulling us about like rag-dolls?
<Airpuff> Well, only thing that might "help" against would most likely be people who're hacking their way to the top..
<SirGanjalf> Ahh, fresh flesh
<Ninjazz> GilDash: That is as sad as it is true.
<Spazturtle> My friend who pireted D3 can play it fine
<GilDash> Kandarihu: Until some bugger works around that. It's no more effective than anything else.
<Airpuff> That boss. Is fat.
<Ryunosuke> Kandarihu, It may be effective BUT, as I stated, if I wanted to play an Online game, I have EVE, if I want to play a singleplayer game, I dont really want to be on the internet
<Ninjazz> That comment. Is obvious.
<Ninjazz> :D
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: So is yours. xD
<Om> Lets play the obvious game!
<Ninjazz> They're both obvious! :D
<GilDash> Ninjazz, Airpuff: Not if your stream's been buffering forever and you can't see it. :D

*Ray glomp-hugs
<GilDash> Om: No way, you'd win. :(
<Ninjazz> Well, one would assume that everyone is watching stream, GilDash.
<Airpuff> Yeah Om is too obvious for us xD
<Om> GilDash: Shhh, they don't know that yet :)
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I'm *trying* to. :D
<Om> Or perhaps they do.
<Ninjazz> Oh... I see.
<GilDash> Om: I'm not willing to find out. :D
<Airpuff> Om ;)

<Airpuff> T.T
<SirGanjalf> Good ol' times: http://i.imgur.com/JncAV.jpg
<GilDash> Om: I'm not sure I can stand to wait that long. I'm very impatient at heart. :)
<Om> Airpuff: Its pure evil by the amout of time you have to worry about it
<Airpuff> GilDash: Agree -.-
<SirGanjalf> I mean spawned Diablo
<Airpuff> .... Yeah yeah.
<Om> GilDash: What? I never would have gessed :o
<Airpuff> Gives me alot of time to mess with you then Om.
<Airpuff> :D
<GilDash> Airpuff: It's evil because part of it is waiting until we've forgotten about it. Even worse, it might be nothing, so we're sat here waiting for something that never arrives...
<Sumica> 00,10nice of her to anounce she has no control
<Airpuff> GilDash: .... i have a simple solution.
<Ninjazz> She was helpful...
<Om> Airpuff: Ask GilDash how much messing with me worked? I may be no master but meh.
<GilDash> Airpuff: It's like the ultimate tease! :O
*Airpuff steals the pepper back from Om

<Sylandest> Airpuff: What are you- *rereads his comment* O///O oh....right...
<Sylandest> GilDash: there's no off switch with that mind of yours, is there? XD
<GilDash> Sylandest: Seriously, it's like one would take something so pure out of context...
<GilDash> Sylandest: Well... no, no there isn't. :D
<MaidSurge> BEES. MY GOD.
<Sylandest> GilDash: Indeed. Airpuff, you pervy pony :P
<GilDash> MaidSurge: They're worse then they're on fire.
<Om> MaidSurge: NO hees mine!
*Airpuff sneaks up behind Sylandest and blows a stream of air into his air "You like making these suggestive conversations dont'cha?"
<MaidSurge> GilDash: do you know where that panel comes from? :D
<Sylandest> Airpuff: *slips away and shivers* It's not me! It's GilDash! I'm an innocent bystander!
*GilDash trots up behind Sylandest, waiting.
<Ran> 2RAY :D
<GilDash> Sylandest: Feeling cold? :(
<Om> Sylandest: You are as innocent as the moon is for stiring the tides
<Ray> 02:D
<GilDash> MaidSurge: Nope. Should I? :D
*Sylandest looks back and forth between Airpuff and GilDash
<Airpuff> I like innocent Sylandest ;)
<GilDash> Airpuff: Eh, it's fun for a while. :)
<Airpuff> GilDash: Eeyup *-*
<Sylandest> GilDash: actually, a wee bit, but I'm perfectly fine. Mild temperatures don't bother me none
<GilDash> Om: But Luna moves the moon, so it's her fault really.
<Sylandest> Airpuff: I am innocent! Or at least, im trying to be!
<GilDash> Sylandest: If you'd like I can warm you up...
<MaidSurge> GilDash: That quote, out of context, is the perfect "face palm quote" for how idiotic that comic is :D
*Airpuff leans against Sylandest "sure tell me all about how innocent you are"
<Sylandest> GilDash: O///O ty, but I'm alright, really! :$
<GilDash> MaidSurge: What quote now? :S
*GilDash hoofs over jacket to Sylandest.
<MaidSurge> GilDash: BEES. MY GOD.
<Om> Sylandest: How does one blush?
<GilDash> Sylandest: But it's so warm and comfy. :)
<GilDash> MaidSurge: I still have no clue as to what you're talking about. :D
<Airpuff> GilDash: Warm and comfy is nice.
<Sylandest> Airpuff: I really am! I'm just trying to tell you all about my day and you keep taking it out of context!
<Sylandest> GilDash: well, if you insist...*slips on jacket* oh my, it is warm
<Om> Ded
<GilDash> Sylandest: How does my heat feel? It's like your wrapped up in me. :)

<GilDash> MaidSurge: No, I keep getting "leech" or whatever. :(
<Ninjazz> ^
<Om> GilDash: I see you're behind then.
<MaidSurge> Dammit
<Sylandest> GilDash: if this is you on a daily basis, the summer must be terrible...
<GilDash> Sylandest: Oh aye, yes. Summer is a right pain. Thank the godesses for pool parties. :)
<Ninjazz> That's why GilDash attacks so many of us on chat, he is bored.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: .... Maybe...
<MaidSurge> GilDash: Batman talking about "a deadly bee weapon. Bees. My God."
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: you call this attacking? lol
<Ninjazz> Not a bad thing, GilDash. ;)
<Viri> 14TIL people are stupid
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: Its quite entertaining though
<GilDash> MaidSurge: Am I being really thick? :D
<Viri> 14subliminal smoking message: people go crazy about how unethic this is
<Ninjazz> Sylandest: A form of it...
<Viri> 14(and I agree)
<Sylandest> GilDash: You are lucky then, I hardly ever attend pool parties here
<Viri> 14stupid gambling websites advertisings ALL OVER ITALY and people are "yay!"
<MaidSurge> Nope, GilDash, it's just the comic being horrible :D
<Viri> 14-___-
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Believe me, if I were attacking there'd be a lot more... physicality. ;)
<GilDash> MaidSurge: I thought as much. :D
<Airpuff> MaidSurge: I didnt really catch any of that comic... xD
<GilDash> Sylandest: I'll have to make you come to one. :)
<Ninjazz> That's why I am on chat now, someone's gotta look after you, GilDash.
<Om> GilDash: I was attacked then. To pushed me over yesterday.
<Om> I call for assault charges!
<Sylandest> GilDash: who would be there? I would hope for lots of pony-folk
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Don't you mean, "Looking after *from* you?" :D
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Either way! :$
<GilDash> Om: You needed that. So did I. :)
<GilDash> Sylandest: All in swim-suits too. ;)
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: I'm basically watching over GilDash, though it seems to be more of him having fun with me...:$
<Om> GilDash: Need is a, strong word.
<GilDash> Om: Okay, *I* needed that. :D
<Sylandest> GilDash: swim...suits? *zones out*
<Airpuff> GilDash: ... seems legit.
<MaidSurge> GilDash, Airpuff: if you want, google "amazons attack" and see if you can find a superhero nerd talking POSITIVELY about it :D
<Om> GilDash: That I belive :)
<Ninjazz> Indeed, Sylandest.

<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://derpy.me/3OjD7
<Jim> pony_2011: Well, that might be if his parents use these irish accented words, he might also use them, therefore, environment decides that
<Sylandest> When I look at my family, I have a tendency to notice that they are all southerners. so for me, it's like all the non-southern blood got transferred and focused to me, hehe

<GilDash> Sylandest: You're the one trussling her up like a turkey...
<Airpuff> Magical_pablez94: Never! xD
<Sylandest> GilDash: I didn't do anything like that! O//O It was just a few rope tricks!
<HyperMetalLugia> dellplz
<Om> Sylandest: You're not innocent. No matter how hard you try.
<Ninjazz> Only when AJ is involed is when Sumi's keen hearing kicks in.
<GilDash> Sumica: Well, I could hardly use telepathy now, could I? The images might frighten him to death! :D
<Phase4> Vordox, newsletters fixed ^_^
<Sylandest> Om: *waves hooves defensively* But I am! I am innocent. GilDash, tell them I'm innocent!
<GilDash> Sylandest: A few rope tricks she asks you to use on her and makes no attempt to get out of. ;)

<Magical_pablez94> PrincessLuna: My princess!! how has your day been?
<Ninjazz> I think... And this is just a stretch here... I think you like Applejack, Sumi!
<Phase4> Vordox, gamemaker?
<Sylandest> GilDash: B-b-but! I'm not trying to do anything! I'm just doing what she says!
<Ninjazz> Hai LunaTheBeloved!
<Lighty> 06she was like "i think it runs a little slow"

<Magical_pablez94> PrincessLuna: princess? are u here?
<Om> Sylandest: Arent you obsequious.
*GilDash hugs Sylandest.
<Sylandest> Magical_pablez94: she left to see avengers
<Sylandest> Om: I'm what now? XD
<GilDash> Sylandest: It's all for the best. Why don't you tell her how you really feel.
<Vordox> GML can be used as msot any other tools for networkin, like Bitshifting, Dead Reckoning Packets etc etc.
<Magical_pablez94> Sylandest: oh, disconnecting is an optional i suupose:D
<GilDash> Om: What did I say about having to use Google? :|
<Viri> 14o.o
<Saturn> 08,01so i just renewed my cello insurance
<Saturn> 08,01£64 for the year
<Jim> Oh my
<Om> Sylandest: Means obedient to a, serval, degree.
<Ninjazz> Nice.
<Sumica> 00,10i...I just happen to think that was not a nice thing they said is all.
<Lighty> 06but she was dowlnloading like
<Saturn> 08,01it always creeps up on me
<Lighty> 06everything
<Phase4> Vordox, strange looking language
<Lighty> 06NO BIG SUPRISE
<Saturn> 08,01because i forget that May is (and has always been) cello re-insure time
<Jim> It's worth it though, if something happens to your cello
<Saturn> 08,01certainly, yes
<Vordox> Phase4: It's like a very easier version of C#
<Sylandest> GilDash: but she's out of my league, Gil! and Sumica has claim already, if I recall correctly
<Vordox> Most of the functions are just simple ways
<Sylandest> howdy by the way, Saturn
<Om> GilDash: Am I distracting you from your prey again with my fancy sesquipedalian format.
<Vordox> Like Direction = Current X+Y Pythagoras
<Saturn> 08,01i have about £6500 worth of stuff covered by my musical instrument insurance
<Vordox> Or image_speed = The speed of the Frame per second for that animation instance.
<GilDash> Sylandest: She wouldn't be messing with you like that if she wasn't interested. She's honesty, after all. ;)
<Vordox> etc etc.
<GilDash> Om: I'm not biting! :D
<Saturn> 08,01mostly my cello, but also £2,000 worth of pro-audio recording equipment too
<Om> GilDash: Not me your not.
<Sylandest> Om: Am I the prey in this scenario?
<GilDash> Om: Good idea!
*GilDash noms Om's ear.
<Sylandest> GilDash: well...I guess you got me there
<Ninjazz> What was not nice? Applejack bucks. I don't see the harm in stating facts. She bucks REAL hard too.
<Jim> so the insurance covers all that?
<Vordox> Pretty simple to make easy coded games instantly.
<GilDash> Sylandest: Well, I'm never not a predator, so I guess you are. ;)
*Om flinches
<Ninjazz> ... Probably didn't need to say that last part...
<teh_Tharassan> -.-
<Saturn> 08,01AJ bucks like a baws.
<Saturn> 08,01need strong legs to buck as well as that
<GilDash> Ninjazz: It's all true though. ;) Play the tapes...
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: you're putting yourself in the same hole I'm in XD
<Saturn> 08,01and good stamina to keep at it all day
<teh_Tharassan> *plays tapes*
*CrazyCherry hugs GilDash from behind
<Ninjazz> I blame you, GilDash.

<CrazyCherry> GilDash: Sorry... But i did come!

<GilDash> Sylandest: You're off the hook... for now. ;)
<CrazyCherry> Magical_pablez94: Good good...
<Sumica> 00,10Down side to lighting magic in skyrim. Knockback
<Sylandest> GilDash: *collapses to the ground* finally, a break
<GilDash> CrazyCherry: ... I've been teasing all day, so I'm going to overlook *that* statement.
*Magical_pablez94 brohoofs CrazyCherry
<Ninjazz> Thats why I always used ice magic.

<GilDash> CrazyCherry: Yeah, I've been playing "got your nose" with Sylandest all day.
<CrazyCherry> Sylandest: I'm sorry to hear.

<Lighty> 06oh god i love pointing out to my ant and uncles that bearshare and most of their "quality" programs are useless :D
<Sylandest> Om: If you can relax and enjoy yourself, that's all I would ask for. I come on here to have fun and smile, and that's precisely what all these pony folk help me do
<FourFire> aha
<GilDash> FourFire: I wouldn't mind trying to make little hippogryphs though. ;)
<Magical_pablez94> GilDash: i'm a smarter then people think
<FourFire> ...

<Sylandest> Om: as do many of us at time, hehe
<Om> GilDash: I take you know the lore of how a hippogryph is produced.

<FourFire> as of now...
<GilDash> Om: I'm *very* familliar. ;)

<Ninjazz> GilDash: You'll need to explain "one-sided" to me. :S
<Ninjazz> Like who?
<Om> GilDash: That is a saying I am unfamiuar with.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Gilda wants Dash. Dash either isn't interested or doesn't know. :)

<Marx> So, you apparently want to make a Staff of Herding I believe it's called.
*Meanwhile prods LunaTheBeloved.
<GilDash> WallDives: Yeah, and each image has this weird white spinning circle thingy on it. I wonder if it's the artist's watermark? :D
<FlareChaser|HL2> I dont find Amnesia scary though, I actually laugh when I'm playing it.
<lbelmore8> I'm watching a circle in the middle of the screen
<Wrek> 05ok how is it now
<Ninjazz> What's that movie again, Meanwhile?
<Vordox> Buffering atm
<WallDives> it might be...
<Vordox> There. GO FGHT!
<Airpuff> But seriously Wrek, is this just you testing or is this going to be permanent? beacuse if this is permanent... you'll have 90% of the people watching pictures...
<Ninjazz> I know I've seen that guy, he's a principle.
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: That was from Ferris Buellers Day Off.
*LunaTheBeloved pokes Meanwhile harder
<Ninjazz> There it is. Yeah.
*Meanwhile squeaks.
<Ninjazz> Thanks.
<pony_2883> hey guys i have a serious question
<doughnutjoe> ok
<Airpuff> pony_2883: fire away
<WallDives> pony_2883: we'll see if we can answer.
<Meanwhile> Will you accept a less than serious answer?
<Ninjazz> And I have a silly answer.
<pony_2883> who is "OP"
<Airpuff> .. original pony.. perhaps?
<Blazang> original poster
<Airpuff> poster? xD
<WallDives> Original poster, probably.
<Blazang> or overpowered
<Meanwhile> OP is a bad person.
<Meanwhile> Never talk to him.
<Airpuff> nvm me then
<Wrek> 05as i said, im just tryign a 1080p stream for the luls
<Vordox> 15-18 FPS while moving, fight about the same. standing still 200
<WallDives> or Overpowered (i.e. fluttershy)
<Blazang> OP is a faggot
*LunaTheBeloved pokes Meanwhile again hard
<pony_2883> i mean he must have to do something with ponies
<Vordox> 20+*
<lbelmore8> OverPowered
<OP> that hurts guys
*Meanwhile wubs.
<OP> :(
<WallDives> pony_2883: depends on context.
*Ninjazz pats OP on the back
<FlareChaser> Ahahahahaha
<FlareChaser> I was OP :3
<teh_Tharassan> :D
<doughnutjoe> Orange peni...
<Wrek> 05ok
*Blazang hugs op
<pony_2883> no not overpowerded
<lbelmore8> *OP left the chat*
<Wrek> 05should be optimal now
<Meanwhile> FlareChaser: Really. The *Flarechaser is now known as OP message didn't tip me off enough.
<Vordox> Go test Wrek.
<WallDives> lol, overpowdered.
<FlareChaser> Meanwhile: wat
<Ninjazz> lol
<Ninjazz> Overpowdered hur hur hur
<pony_2883> i mean i was on omegle and somebody said he would like to kill OP and his bronies....
<teh_Tharassan> who was op and why you hate him?
<Meanwhile> I get notified of name changes.
<panda> How come there are so many ponies afk?
<Dken2021> pony_2883 that's original poster
<WallDives> I can also see nick changes.
<pony_2883> and who is that?
<Meanwhile> OP means original poster. It's generally a forum thing.
<Meanwhile> It refers to whoever started the topic.
<Ninjazz> I suppose its the 4chan thread. :S
<doughnutjoe> How do you know?!?
<Meanwhile> Because I'm the goddamn Batman.
<Vordox> Not that optimal, Wrek.
<pony_2883> Ninjazz which one?
<Batwhile> The hero you need.
<Ninjazz> The first.
<Blazang> its alright...
<Airpuff> not optimal indeed
<lbelmore8> so in that case pony_2883 is OP
<Vulpy> TO THE BATMOBILE!
<Batwhile> But not the hero you deserve.
<panda> You didnt say it in a deep voice meanwhile
<Wrek> 05gettign 20fps while moving
<Dken2021> pony_2883 just a term to know
<Batwhile> panda: My voice is naturally bass.
<Vordox> Standing still = 30 + FPS, but when fighting it's about 15-18 FPS, and moving around the same.
<Ninjazz> What about Sumerpan, Batwhile?
<Wrek> 0530 while still
<panda> Batwhile: XD oh hi!
<Wrek> 05doesnt seem to get better than that
<Batwhile> Ninjazz: I keep kryptonite on hand.
<Vordox> Aye.
<Vordox> Sad. :(
<doughnutjoe> You know......
<Ninjazz> Batwhile: Smart...
<Wrek> 05oh well
<doughnutjoe> You didn't tell what the movie was yet
<WallDives> but Sumerpan doesnt care about Kryptonite...
<Batwhile> The hero chat needs, but not the one it deserves.
<panda> Batwhile: but sumerpan's weakness isnt kryptonite... its... erm nevermind
<GilDash> Batwhile: Why did your voice get so gravelly all of a sudden?
<Vordox> D3 is Graphic intense so.. :P
<Kid_Cobalt> Well I cant even see half of the fight due to the stream being like an ocean full of knives at the moment....choppy. So ill be back later.
<Ninjazz> doughnutjoe: Sunshine. That is the title of the movie.
<Dken2021> doughnutjoe check the front page
<Batwhile> GilDash: *Gravelly noises*
<doughnutjoe> What it about?
<lbelmore8> Bronystate changes topics quite fast
<Ninjazz> Cya Kid_Cobalt
<Wrek> 05how is it now
<Vordox> Go test Fight
<panda> lbelmore8: hehe yes yes we do ^^
<Ninjazz> doughnutjoe: Sunshine, I guess.
<WallDives> lbelmore8: chat almost always moves fast.
<Wrek> 05Kid_Cobalt: no stay here
<Dken2021> quite better than ever Wrek
<LunaTheBeloved> The hero that no one wants, but wants you to feel good about yourself so you can stay
<Wrek> 05the whole point is that you give feedback
<Ninjazz> Move around, Wrek...
<Vordox> Standing still = 30+ FPS
<Airpuff> Wrek It looks smooth now
<teh_Tharassan> PERFECT!!
<Vordox> Moving = 25-30 FPS
<Airpuff> Wrek wow ywah its smooth
<Ninjazz> PERFECT!
<Airpuff> Perfect, keep it there
<Ninjazz> Looking good, Wrek!
<Airpuff> x)
<doughnutjoe> What if....

<Batwhile> You know I'm starting to believe you really don't like me.
<panda> I got buffering >.>
<Dken2021> just run with this

<Invi> hio pyrocatboy
<Vulpy> I'm back. My internet spazzed. XD

<LunaTheBeloved> French
<Airpuff> Invi: But this is kinda redicolus ._. Its like.. his hp.. it dosent go below 50%...
<RankWinner> Lil_B And Diablo costs, just play Path of Exile. It's free, and better =D

<Ninjazz> RAWRity: If God of War had a bird's eye view camera, yes.
<Flutters> this game is interesting
*Meanwhile shrugpony.
<Lil_B> but then i remember that I like Port Royale, and the only thing you do there is buying a ship, buying goods and sell sthem for a higher price XD
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Meanwhile, just tell him hes obviously wrong because hes french
<Meanwhile> That'd defeat the point of me being right.
<GilDash> Damnit Opera, I am losing patience with you. :|

<Lil_B> When I buy a new PC, and i want to keep the ld one to try Stuff out, what kind of OS should i use? Linux or AmigaOS?
<GilDash> Om: I've had them for about 1 1/2 years now. That's why I stopped using it ages ago. And it was interactivity with flash, because the moment I disabled that plugin everything worked, but obviously no flash was loaded.
<GilDash> Airpuff: ... What'll you do if I don't? ;)
<Airpuff> .... ;)
<Airpuff> Anywas change now!
<Airpuff> xD
<Airpuff> anyways*

<Om> Airpuff: Alls I know is if I do make an OP, it would be an earth pony. Cuse I'm a hypster.
<Meanwhile> Skype pings indiscriminately.
*Airpuff looks around for Sumerpan
<Invi> Airpuff it depends on how big the star is. and a doublestar has first to fusion and has to be cold enough to colaps.
<twilight_sprinkler> Lil_B: its a quote from Pi
<rotomfna63> i wonder if i say YAY
<SirGanjalf> You'll get mad, start seeing numbers and end up with a hole in your head:O
<Airpuff> Om Earth pony?! Why? xD
<RX-78-SweetieBot> you could just use sound control to mute it
<ACS13123> 30 seconds!
<Meanwhile> Besides, what's the point in a regulars skype group when regulars chat exists.
<WallDives> anyway, I'll be back later.
<GilDash|AFK> Om: Actually, I've see a lot of Earth ponies. Unicorns are usually the rarest.

<CrazyCherry> Space? SPAAAAAAAAAAACE!!
<prince-dari> So how has best fort been?
<Meanwhile> Why would they name a ship built to rekindle the sun or whatever "Icarus"?
<otakon> The gist of this movie: They go to fix the sun, the journey takes years to do so.
<SilverSonic|Android> ;3
<SilverSonic|Android> Thx*
<otakon> Meanwhile: irony.
<Meanwhile> That's like naming an Icebreaker "Titanic"
<SirGanjalf> Meanwhile: Screnwriters are trolls:p
<Lil_B> Meanwhile maybe they know it will fail
<Ninjazz2> The sun is dying.
<Quicksilver> Icarus was a dude who flew too close to the sun
<SirGanjalf> *screen
*CrazyCherry wakes up
<Bjornfot> prince-dari: Busy as horsefeathers with school and all that. ;_;
<Airpuff> Deep within.. we're all space-cores...
<otakon> Quicksilver: eeyup
<Invi> Meanwhile because they already know they will become crazy?
<prince-dari> Ahh. :<
<Meanwhile> Quicksilver: No shit. That's why the name is a bad idea.
*CrazyCherry hugs everypony
*Airpuff hugs CrazyCherry
<Kandarihu> I'd like to know why they didn't just fire a nuclear missile at the sun.
<Bjornfot> dem finals ya know

<Kool_Pony> das cool
<Ninjazz2> Isn't that Asian guy from Lost?
<Meanwhile> Toasty.
<Wrek> 05it may not be a "good movie"
<Kandarihu> Slyphoenix: the sun is a chain reaction of nuclear explosions.
<twilight_sprinkler> Lil_B: you dont wanna see anything? ok, ill poke your eyes out then
<Airpuff> Om wut?! xD
<RankWinner> A big enough shockwave could probably destroy the sun
<Wrek> 05but its sure as fuck is a beautiful movie
<Vordox> Sumica. You're an arse :P
<Airpuff> Om i rock at space.
<LunaTheBeloved> Join us....
<Ninjazz2> Indeed, Wrek.
<Vordox> THIS ISN'T the 1999 BORING one! THIS is the GOOD ONE!
<SirGanjalf> Slyphoenix: I doubt humanity's whole nuclear arsenal would do any hrm to Sun.
<derpy_pony> hello everypony
<LunaTheBeloved> Jooooooin us.....
<Lil_B> is this the venus?
<Bjornfot> yay~
<SirGanjalf> 8harm

<Lil_B> Saturn are you made out of water?
<Slyphoenix> yay
<Meanwhile> Sling stance.
<Ninjazz2> Hah, CNreal!
<ACS13123> i broke it, yay
<Kandarihu> Well, if one nuclear missile wouldn't be enough, how about launching ALL the nuclear missiles at the sun. Surely firepower capable of destroying everything on the Earth's surface several hundred times over would do something.
<rotomfan63> (usesfalcon buck)
<pony_9001> what movie is this
<rotomfan63> ^
<Michael> TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOON

*Airpuff blesses CrazyCherry litteraly with holy smoke and holy water.

<LunaTheBeloved> Screw tin!
<Meanwhile> So they sent an Icarus 2.
<Dken2021> Lil_B so the nerds can have something to woo over
<otakon> holy shit they could make it.
<CrazyCherry> Airpuff: Wait what?
*Ninjazz2 coughs
<Ninjazz2> >>
<ND|Busy> 11,01SirGanjalf: I would believe that this was Trollestia's work.
<Airpuff> CrazyCherry: One says "Bless you" When somepony sneezes. I blessed you with the blessings of god. XDD
<Invi> Kandarihu behold the difference in size between sun and earth
<Meanwhile> Why not name this one Apollo, or Rah, or Ablejimtob.
<Conyst> Bad idea to call it Icarus
<Lil_B> Dken2021 can mine have an accent?
<Kandarihu> Bad time for the movie to buffer
<Meanwhile> Besides, even if I wanted to join the skype group, that's not how it works.
