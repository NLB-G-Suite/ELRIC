<Hrafn> I'm the youngest at 28 :P
<alexxm> i'm the youngest at 18
<Imperios> You know, you will easily recognise my sister XD
<alexxm> not counting cousins
<Phase4> 00,02could take this one to minmus
<Pudge> Imperios: how so?
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Imperios> Well, when we have bought a gift to her birthday
<Phase4> 00,02so what'ya guys say
<Phase4> 00,02minmus attempt?
<Pudge> go for it
<Noteworthy> +Phase4: Go for it
<Phase4> 00,02its the smaller moon thats father away
<Hrafn> sure :3
<Imperios> She told "No, that's not Celestia! That's Trollestia!"
<crazypony> yes
<Imperios> *said
<alexxm> lets do it
<Pudge> the worst that could happen is splosions
<Hrafn> *best
<Pudge> lol
<Imperios> She did not like the pink hue of Celestia toy
<alexxm> Pudge thats not that bad
<SkylerArmor> question: anyone can stream through brony state? or is like phase 1 of the staff mems
<Pudge> You're little sister knows what trollestia is?
<Imperios> Yep
<Pudge> that's a little disturbing
<Imperios> Well
<Pudge> :D
<Imperios> I call Celestia "Trollestia" sometimes
<Pudge> oh my bad i was thinking molestia
<Imperios> She started doing the same
<Pudge> that would be worse
<Imperios> Hur
<SkylerArmor> are you answering my question or just saying yep?
<Pudge> SkylerArmor: only mods and phase can
<Imperios> And she also knows who is the pony postman
<Pudge> derpy hooves
<Imperios> Yep
<SkylerArmor> oh ok jw.
<Clopper_EXTREME> hell yeah
<Imperios> Well we just call her Derpy
<Pudge> so you're family knows you're a brony?
<SkylerArmor> how many mods are there for brony state if you mind me asking
<Pudge> your*
<alexxm> its easier to i guess
<Pudge> SkylerArmor: 20 or so
<Imperios> Pudge: I am not sure TBH
<Pudge> oh i was jw, because i'm a closet brony myself
<SkylerArmor> oh
<MadSurge> Well guys, going off to get ready. I might not get back on, so see you tomorrow! (maybe)
<Imperios> Well they seem partially aware given how much do I know about ponies and stuff
<Pudge> later MadSurge
<Pudge> Imperios: I see
<SkylerArmor> my family doesnt know im a brony and if they did they would care less about it
<Hrafn> I haven't told my parents, but I don't think they'd really care, and both my brothers are bronies too :P
<Pudge> My parents wouldnt care but my brother in law would tease me about it
<Imperios> Well, when we bought a pony for my sister, my parents told me to help them to choose a pony for her cause I am "the expert at that stuff"
<Pudge> lol
<Hrafn> aww :3
<SkylerArmor> half my friends know but they dont care and they arent bronies. i could try to make them one but im just too lazy
<Imperios> Not sure did they mean MLP or just toys and cartoons in general
<Pudge> that would be awkward
<Pudge> this song
<Pudge> <3
<Imperios> After all, not even I do know whether am I a brony or not
<Imperios> Let alone my parents
<Pudge> do you watch the show?
<Imperios> Yes, primarily with my sister
<Pudge> brony at the bare minimum means fan of mlp
<Pudge> you dont have to be a great artist or make music
<Imperios> My inner sense of honour forbids me from watching MLP alone
<Hrafn> yeah, if you enjoy the show in a non-ironic manner, I'd say you could count yourself as a brony
<Pudge> I felt that way at first
<Dark_Horst> this sounds like lunar republic. never heard that mix before, who did it?
<Imperios> Yeah
<Pudge> I remember there was a chat that I visted sometimes that was full of bronies
<SkylerArmor> i think phase is going around the planet
<XAX> I clipped my McDonalds Pinkie Pie to my schoolbag and kept it there for like a month.
<Pudge> i was a hater at that time but then I finally decided to see what it was all about so I forced myself to watch all of season 1
<Hrafn> I fell in love with the show after the first two episodes :)
<XAX> I only left at home because someone stole the clip -_-
<Pudge> first episode, WHY AM I WATCHING THIS I MUST BE GAY
<Pudge> 2nd episode, not bad
<alexxm> same here Hrafn
<Pudge> rest of season BEST THING EVER
<XAX> Pudge: Sounds about right.
<Imperios> Hur
<Noteworthy> im sure i became a brony after watching winter wrap up
<XAX> People were laughing at my bags irony. A pink pony hanging from a BF3 satchel bag.
<Pudge> Who said ponies cant use guns
<Noteworthy> pinkie used twilight as a minigun.
<Hrafn> I was bored and thought I'd give it a shot since I had been seeing a lot of fan art of it, and expected to see something silly that I could make fun of to myself, but I pretty quickly fell in love with the show and just kept watching
<Imperios> Hur
<Pudge> I think I really fell in love with the show during the sonic rainboom ep
<SkylerArmor> dude, pudge my story is a bit similar... except i wasnt a hater. my friend (girl) told me about it, showed me clip art.. and i was like... wow, so i was decided to watch a episode.
<Imperios> Ponies have cannons
<Imperios> Meaning they can guns
<Imperios> &have
<Imperios> And according to Russian translation of MLP
<Imperios> They have handguns
<Pudge> lolwut?
<Phase4> 00,02 /)_-
<SkylerArmor> when i watched the 1st episode, i kinda got unconfee.. but then i suddently just watched all of s1 and i watched s2. in 1 day.. or maybe 2
<Phase4> 00,02staging broke
<alexxm> what Imperios
<Phase4> 00,02deorbit time
<Pudge> uh oh
<Imperios> In Cutie Mark Chronicles' Russian translation
<Pudge> Phase4 does that mean the mission is a failure?
<Imperios> Instead of asking for a cannon Scootaloo did ask for a handgun
<Phase4> 00,02mission failure
<Pudge> fission mailed
<Pudge> insert coin?
<Imperios> Derpy can mail fission yes
<Dark_Horst> i found it in the first few month after i was bored and went on 4chan. sw the pony-threads and since that fit as much like a step-dancing potatoe, i decided to find out about it. watched the first few es that where out at the time (4, i think)
<Imperios> My sister has 14 ponies
<Imperios> U jelly
<Dark_Horst> i actually almost stopped after the pilot. i'm happy i didnt
<Imperios> ?
<Pudge> Imperios: and it's supposed to be a kids show?
<Imperios> Yep
<Hrafn> I found out about the show from furry sites and friends :P
<Pudge> and no i'm not really jelly, i wouldnt buy merchandise unless it's a t-shirt
<Imperios> Russian Bronies HATE the official translation
<Phase4> 00,02probably could have made it actually
<Phase4> 00,02but meh
<Imperios> They call it Cancerousel
<SkylerArmor> whats the point of collecting mlp fim dolls?
<Dark_Horst> i think lauren said that she wanted to make a kids show that the whole family could watch
<Phase4> 00,02realy need the staging to work right
<Hrafn> well, I kinda hate what I've seen so far of the official Swedish translation
<Phase4> 00,02^ Dark_Horst
<Imperios> Carousel + Cancer, Russian is Rakosel
<Noteworthy> yeah the show is a family show more than a childrens show
<Imperios> Also, there is a cool way to watch MLP, improve your English skills and help your sister
<Dark_Horst> Hrafn: be lucky you're not german
<Pudge> alright well i'm gonna hop off here now. bye everypony and good talkin to you Imperios.
<SkylerArmor> Trains.
<Hrafn> Dark_Horst: I'm guessing the German dub is really bad? :P
<Imperios> Watch the Canterlot Wedding, in English, with your sister, while translating it
<Imperios> Well
<alexxm> my internet derped
<Imperios> Russian dub is good voice-wise
<Phase4> 00,02THE ENGINE
<Phase4> 00,02IT DOES NOTHING
<Vordox> <3
<Dark_Horst> Hrafn: technically, there are probably worse, but somehow they made it sound a few levels more infantile. it's like a different show
<Pudge> night everyone
<alexxm> bye Pudge
<Dark_Horst> it's definaely below average
<Hrafn> yeah, that's kinda how the Swedish dub sounds to me, it's just... more childish
<Imperios> Same with Russian dub
<Vordox> Extended song, Phase? O.o
<Hrafn> and they still use the English names, which just makes it sound like awkward Swenglish :P
<Hrafn> it's like "bork bork bork Twilight Sparkle bork bork"
<Imperios> Russian uses English names with all ponies but Rainbow Dash, NMM and Twilight
<Imperios> And Cakes
<Dark_Horst> i thought that'S petty normal... then again, we have more english influences in our language nowadays
<Imperios> Which are
<Hrafn> same here, modern Swedish slang contains a lot of English words
<Dark_Horst> Imperios: curses B)
<Nurse_Major> Perfect
<Phase4> 00,02all in all that went well
<Starflash> nice, Phase.
<alexxm> congrats Phase4
<Nurse_Major> Phase4: at least theyre alive...for now....
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i missed the explodes
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, i has idea
<Noteworthy> random boom
<Hrafn> whoa, explosions AND surviving astronauts
<Hrafn> you, sir, win space
<Imperios> Raduga (Rainbow), Lunnaya Poni (the Moon Pony), Sumerechnaya Iskorka or just Iskorka (Twilight Sparkle/Sparkle) and Pirozhok
<Imperios> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirozhki
<Noteworthy> well im off to bed
<Noteworthy> goodnight
<Dark_Horst> but you know what'S bad? we dont have a direct translation for cutie mark. at least not one that's commonly used
<Hrafn> good night Noteworthy
<Imperios> Sonic Rainboom is Rainbow too
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: hmm?
<Imperios> Dur Horst
<Imperios> We failed worse
<alexxm> night Noteworthy
<Dark_Horst> so instead, they went with schönheitsfleck. which means beauty mark. and sound stupid
<Imperios> We call Cutie Marks "insignias".
<Imperios> No, seriously
<Hrafn> I'm not sure how it's translated in the Swedish version
<Dark_Horst> Imperios: a lot better than what we do
<Hrafn> I've only really seen clips of it, never a whole episode
<Imperios> Znak otlichiya. Literally, the mark of difference and usually used for military insignias.
<Dark_Horst> okay, that is kind aawesome xD
<Imperios> We do not have a direct translation for Winter Wrap Up
<Phase4> 00,02that worked well enough
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: did you see that there? your fuel tanks lusted for your blood
<Dark_Horst> when in doubt, NOAR ROCKERT!
<Imperios> Grand Galloping Gala is the Great Gala Concert
<XAX> http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/27700000/Surprise-Angel-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-27716364-600-600.png
<Imperios> Luckily this transation is rarely ever used
<Dark_Horst> it'S gonna break
<kidzrul434> I can't believe season 3 is coming in August!
<Dark_Horst> august? HOLY SHIT!
<Imperios> How was 20% cooler translated in your country?
<Imperios> I am normally anti-Imperial
<Imperios> BUT SHIT
<Imperios> PRAISE THE EMPEROR OF MANKIND FOR THIS
<Hrafn> wobbly :o
<Imperios> YES YES
<Imperios> YES
<Dark_Horst> that's like, half a month
<Dark_Horst> oh boy, you got me excited not
<Imperios> So now was 20% cooler translated?
<Dark_Horst> *now
<alexxm> i thought it was starting september
<Imperios> Same
<Dark_Horst> Imperios: who said something about whatnow?
<Phase4> 00,02clearly this will work
<Dark_Horst> ceiling
<Starflash> Of course
<Hrafn> there's no way this could end badly
<Starflash> >What could go wrong?
<Dark_Horst> you are blessed by the ceiling
<alexxm> does anyone think this will end well
<Hrafn> this rocket = best rocket
<Hrafn> oh god
<Starflash> And we call it... the boomerang
<Hrafn> I'm not even gonna say what this reminds me of
<Imperios> Because Russian version is
<Imperios> NNNGH
<Imperios> 20% BETTER
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: some struts, some fins, additional engines at the nose
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> This Rocket will work
<Dark_Horst> when in doubt, more engines
<alexxm> put the team rocket logo on it
<Phase4> 00,02nah
<Phase4> 00,02its all good
<Phase4> 00,02more engines though

<Hipster_Rush|Zzz> nb4 overcumbered Phase4
<MegaMoonShine> Dammit, I even just made up a theme song :(
<Jim> My cabbages!
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Cypresswolf: only if you have infinite bag room
<Jim> Pff, strap a TARDIS to your back
<Cypresswolf> ^ Thats what Hax are for :P
<Sylandest> Phase4: This is your obligatory reminder to get that pony mod for your character. I'm heading off to work now. Laters all!
<Jim> Infinite room
<Chocobunny> No.. why Skyrim? :C It sucks.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Cypresswolf: :D is there one for room in backpack? i use godmode when too much stuff
<AdamTheDuck> Chocobunny: WHY DO YOU SPEAK SUCH BLASPHEMY?
<Chocobunny> AdamTheDuck: Skyrim doesn't have shit on Oblivion, Morrowind and Daggerfall.
<Jim> Why do people always complain about what's being streamed :c
<Chocobunny> I can't speak for Arena, however, because I've never played it.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Skyrim doesnt suck, its a very well-made game. even if you dont like it
<SirGanjalf> Chocobunny: In what Oblivion is better than Skyrim?
<Cypresswolf> twi_sprinkle_GS17: :3 I actually used god mode on a game in Oblivion and tried to take everything I could grab - never did collect everything
<Chocobunny> :SirGanjalf Oblivion at least had colour to it.
<MegaMoonShine> Kinda sucks that Skyrim doesn't have a battle arena like in Oblivion, I really liked that
<Chocobunny> ^^
<Chocobunny> I LOVED the imperial arena.
<Cypresswolf> got bored with it when I had a hard time finding a certain item - hundreds of a duplicated items just scrolling :D
<MegaMoonShine> Cypresswolf: That was so great :D
<AdamTheDuck> what ever happened to the gates of oblivion? i never finished the game xD
<SirGanjalf> I find Skyrim pretty colorful for a land pof perpetual snow
<Chocobunny> AdamTheDuck: I'm not going to spoil it.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> nice job Phase :D
<MegaMoonShine> I actually do kinda agree about that whole "colour" thing
<Chocobunny> So.. anyone here going to buy The Elder Scrolls: Online when it gets out in 2013?
<SirGanjalf> not me
<AdamTheDuck> Chocobunny: looks kinda horrible
<Chocobunny> It's a retex of WoW.
<BrOnyxia> Chocobunny: i will maybe
<Chocobunny> Yeah, even though, I'll probably also buy it.
<AdamTheDuck> NOO ZE LOOT
<Jim> I'm gonna be too busy with GW2 to start with another online thingy
<MegaMoonShine> Phase4: Y U take so much stuff?!
<AdamTheDuck> goodbye.. steve...
<Chocobunny> GW2?
<Chocobunny> Oh, Guild Wars.
<Jim> Guild Wars 2
<Chocobunny> I've heard of it.
<Phase4> 00,02MegaMoonShine, loot
<Chocobunny> I can't wait until Dishonored gets out.
<SirGanjalf> I to looks like they got rid of everything that defines TES gameplay to make it look more WoW-ish
<Chocobunny> That's like the highligt game of the year for me.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> 7 imperail swords.lol.
<SirGanjalf> Because, we don't have enough WoW-alike MMO's:|
<BrOnyxia> gotta go back administrating cya
<MegaMoonShine> Bye BrOnyxia :)
<Chocobunny> Lol, Wrek is playing more Warhammer.
<AdamTheDuck> which one?
<Chocobunny> 40k.
<Chocobunny> It saddens me however, that TES:Online is ruining what every fan of the TES series ever wanted.
<lowfn> I'm back everypony :$ What happened while I was gone
<AdamTheDuck> 40k is the one with the space marines right? been ages sinse i played that
<MegaMoonShine> Not a lot lowfn

*lowfn slowly drifts into sleep when he snaps himself back awake
<SirGanjalf> Chocobunny: yeah, typical class system, no 1st person view
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> yay mages
<Chocobunny> SirGanjalf: You know that every TES game had a class system (excluding Skyrim), right?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> good guy phase
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> i hope phase likes spiders
<SirGanjalf> Chocobunny: I meant TYPICAL rpg class system
<SirGanjalf> in which you define your class at the very beginning
<Unnr> To be fair, many fans of TES have wanted some form of multiplayer
<lowfn> There be narwalls in these caves
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> spider time
<Chocobunny> But this is ruining that wish.
<Chocobunny> I mean, a WoW look-a-like?
<Wrek> 05Unnr: yes, but since they are makign basically a wow clone for a game like TES
<Chocobunny> All we wanted was a CoOp mode.

<Chocobunny> Phase4: Oy! Don't ignore my suggestion! Get a good dagger!
<MegaMoonShine> There's an invisibility spell for illusion isn't there?
<Chocobunny> There is.
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4: Illusion = invisibility and you can get enemies to kill each other rather than take them out yourself
<Phase4> 00,02hmmmm
<Chocobunny> Phase4: Get a dagger.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> when i got out of helgen, i just randomly went up a mountain and found a power word

<Waffles> it will scar u for life :S
<tigher1001> bullet time
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> i actually took my earphones off but it was still loud as hell
<Hrafn> hi everyone
<PonyNegZero> Vordox: I wouldn't say I wasn't startled, but I'm not dying, because dying is bad...

<PonyNegZero> don't cut me bro!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nords Represent
<Hat> Set fire to the web
<Kandarihu> I clicked on it. It's just a screamer. My only indication that it was loud came from the fact that my other audio going on was very quiet when it closed out.
<tigher1001> DONT
<Hat> How slow he runs lol
<tigher1001> ...cut him down
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> did phse save?

<twi_sprinkle_GS17> lol
<tigher1001> ouch
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Phase4: just so you know, those zombie things get out from tombs, so be aware of your surroundings
<Hat> Oblivion had randomly generated forests, is Skyrim the same?
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: but not in a Mr. T voice
<oni_link> Waffles , Darkts3|Drawing|MLG , and Hat , how are you all? :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> good

<twi_sprinkle_GS17> nop
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> lol
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: why loot everything?
<Hat> When he brought up the Draugr inventory, I got an ad for dresses right in the screen for items
<Phase4> 00,02i like this door
<oni_link> Im glad I have time to kill before I head out to work :J
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: Door is credit to Nord
<tigher1001> +Phase4: Yeah its good at baseball
<Hat> Clever girl...
<Phase4> 00,02i broke the door
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: lol
<tigher1001> that sucks :'(
<oni_link> Too much stuff, you are carrying Phase4
<Vordox> It's not going good for Phase :P
<killerpony7733> A good rule in skyrim never carry stuff you know you won't have use for
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<valoreins|Drawing> ohai everypony
<killerpony7733> And never hoard stuff
<oni_link> Sell all the things!
<tigher1001> +Phase4: you should not loot everything
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> i like how they made the traps have limited effect, since they couldnt be unlimited cause no good energy storing devices in that world
<tigher1001> 0_o
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol save there
<Phase4> 00,02tigher1001, clearly i am not looting enough
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: just take stuff you really want
<valoreins|Drawing> is this Skyrim with DLC?
<oni_link> I want this game soo bad
<Deadlypon3> WHOAH, THis all back in time SPACE on screen
<tigher1001> +Phase4, lol

<tigher1001> now that is your favorite door
<tigher1001> so use it
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> yay for ancient gasoline
<killerpony7733> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Hint it's oil
<oni_link> arrows should be retrieveable like in Zelda
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> killerpony7733: no its probably gasoline for the nordmobiles
<PonyNegZero> twi_sprinkle_GS17: pimp-nord-mobiles
<killerpony7733> So they use them it for their horses then?
<killerpony7733> :O
<PonyNegZero> twi_sprinkle_GS17/killerpony7733: even their cars and horses have beautiful beards
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> the gasoline fuels the beards as well
<killerpony7733> glowing mushies
<oni_link> I wanna see this character in 3rd person
<PonyNegZero> Phase4 is such an environmentalist, he only takes what he needs and makes sure not to disrupt the ecosystems with his gathering
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma head back now
<killerpony7733> Phase4: No no no no
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: Exploration is fun, you get kewl stuff
<Phase4> 00,02is there a quick exit?
<oni_link> ^ ^ ^ ^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: follow the water
<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, i cant carry that much
<Phase4> 00,02ok,,,,
<Phase4> 00,02but it goes down
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: i wonder why =/
<Phase4> 00,02a big hole
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Quick exit is forward
<killerpony7733> :D
<PonyNegZero> killerpony7733: quick exit being death?
<killerpony7733> So you need to continue
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> im pretty sure you should follow the waters
<killerpony7733> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Only way out quickly enough is completing the dungeon now
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> true
<oni_link> lol nope.avi
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: my thoughts exactly

<killerpony7733> Phase4: Actually from this point it's the quickest way out
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> ohh i think i get it why phase has better gear so earl, must be cause of difficulty
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<Phase4> 00,02oh

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: just finish the dungeon
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Just remember to not give the golden claw away just yet, You need it to get to the end of the dungeon
<oni_link> He cant carry much though Sumica
<PonyNegZero> 1 gamer, 20 backseat drivers

<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: your loot is unimporant anyway
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: do you really really really need it?, you keep getting crap
<tigher1001> shing shing shing

<oni_link> PonyNegZero: Haha that happens with these types of games :D
<killerpony7733> ^What sumica said

<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, those things are 300 gold each
<Phase4> 00,02and i have like 20

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Enchanted Weapons
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Phase4: further in the dungeon there is better loot
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<Sumica> 00,10you wont get that much for em
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Phase4: the pricing is false
<killerpony7733> Sumica: Exactly hardly much worth,
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Phase4: the vendors dont actually pay that much for them
<Saturn> 08,01urgh
<Saturn> 08,01hectic morning
<killerpony7733> Saturn: Hiya
<Saturn> 08,01and afternoon
<oni_link> Hello Saturn :P
*PonyNegZero nuzzles Saturn.
<tigher1001> +Phase4 well if you start dragon hunting
<Sumica> 00,10sup Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01so i just had to make an announcement
<Saturn> 08,01and this is the reason i've not been here much lately
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: loot matters in the end
<tigher1001> hi saturn
<Saturn> 08,01john de lancie pulled out of BUCK
<pony_7007> won't +Phase4 have to rekill the enemies he's already killed if he leaves
<killerpony7733> Damn
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma go outside
<oni_link> Saturn: wow that sucks
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: why?
<Phase4> 00,02done with the dungeoun for now
<Sumica> 00,10No pony_7007
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, :(
<Saturn> 08,01so i've been running around like a headless chicken trying to get him back, and/or get a replacement guest
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: you were probably close to the end tho just saying
<Phase4> 00,02replacment for john de lancie?
<Saturn> 08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: he got called upon to do an acting job that clashes with our event
<Sumica> 00,10Saturn that sucks man. Not cool that he would do that.
<Saturn> 08,01and he said that acting has to take priority
<PonyNegZero> Well, in the end of the day, he needs money....
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> it is his job
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> ^
<Phase4> 00,02well if its work
<oni_link> Kinda true when you think about it. Putting food on the table vs seeing fans, money wins.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> there are many voice actors out there
<tigher1001> +Phase4: you need to get a horse its awsome
<Saturn> 08,01PonyNegZero: well, it's not just that; he's an actor. if he'd turned down, say, torchwood or even MLP to do a convention, we wouldn't have as much awesome stuff to squee about, right?
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: true.
<Saturn> 08,01which is why acting must come first
<Saturn> 08,01still, it's a bummer
<oni_link> Especially since that also means more work for you eh, Saturn?
<Sumica> 00,10still not cool you would think he could some how work both in.
<Saturn> 08,01oni_link: yup. that's why i've not been around much lately.
<tigher1001> lol
<oni_link> Sorry to hear that
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: Skype video call between main panel room and him?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Sumica: the events are probably not even in the same country, so time clashes cant be fixed
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> well it depends Sumica, what release date the show/game comes out
<Sumica> 00,10and acting is not a oneday gig
<Phase4> 00,02how i sell
<Sumica> 00,10is't buck on the weekend?
<Phase4> 00,02also cant give him claw
<Phase4> 00,02funny that
<killerpony7733> Phase4: That's good
<tigher1001> +Phase4: did you loot the claw
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Phase4: claw is needed
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh boyyyyy
<Sumica> 00,10Claw is plot element
<Phase4> 00,02tigher1001, yep
<Sumica> 00,10game comes to dead end with out it
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> odds are with all the crap, Phase probably dropped it
<Phase4> 00,02apanrently i misread what swords were worth
<Phase4> 00,02:(
<valoreins|Drawing> glitch/bug?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: rofl
<Sumica> 00,10no you read it corectly
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Phase4: no,its like i said earlier, vendors dont pay as much as the pricing says
<Sumica> 00,10but the prices are based on vendor and skills
<Sumica> 00,10the most you could get is 300
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Phase4: you still have that save game so you can go back
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Phase4> 00,02so i effectively got screwed there
<tigher1001> +Phase4: its not in your invitory
<Sumica> 00,10yup
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Shouldn't you level up?
<valoreins|Drawing> did you accidentaly dropped it maybe?
<Phase4> 00,02tigher1001, yes it is
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yup
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, probably
<Sumica> 00,10it's ok Phase4 every one learns that lesson
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yup
<oni_link> real life lessons in Skyrim lol
<Phase4> 00,02health magicka or stamina?
<Sumica> 00,10SuperBrony64 was looting every thing not nailed down
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: Health
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Phase4: prolly best to start with health

<twi_sprinkle_GS17> dat 20%
<Sumica> 00,10it's like extra packs that have +carry enchants
<oni_link> PonyNegZero: What sorcery dost thou speak?
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: I'm not sure if Sumica typed out SB64 rather than Phase4 in an earlier message
<Sumica> 00,10PonyNegZero no I ment SuperBrony64
<Kingman725> hello all
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: what are you doing now?

<Phase4> 00,02that is a point
<Potanity> I'm considering telling my friend that I don't like ponies anymore so he stops talking about them. Would that work or would it just make things worse?
<Sumica> 00,10just ask em to stop
<oni_link> If I had to pick 1 FPS and 1 RPG to buy, what would you reccomend?
<Phase4> 00,02prince of persia fun?
<Bronysith> Phase4: YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS

<Potanity> Sumica: That's like asking someone who wants to kill you to stop.
<Phase4> 00,02i take that as a yes
<Sumica> 00,10sounds like not much of a friend
<PonyNegZero> Potanity: Don't die, dying is bad.

<Sumica> 00,10how should I know
<Bronysith> Wrek i played some deus ex original. pretty kewl

<RobertRevenge> Barbetos|Atwork: The game is damn near impossible if you go full frontal assault all the time
<Meanwhile> Did he say "Come on out I'm a physicist"?
<Barbetos|Atwork> When I played it I sneaked all the time. Course I was trying to do a no kill run,
<Wrek> 05Sumica: remember iron sights :3
<Barbetos|Atwork> Which I managed to not do somehow.
<MegaMoonShine> Meanwhile: "I'mma finish ya!"
<Wrek> 05middle mouse
<Wrek> 05iirc
<Meanwhile> MegaMoonShine: "I'm a physacist" sounds better.
<PonyNegZero> Wrek: Iron sights are nothing compared to floating white markers
<MegaMoonShine> Meanwhile: Yep, wouldn't want to mess with a physicist :D
<red_ony> I wish there were some good mods of this game...From the LPs I watched it isn't RPish enough for me.. :/
<MegaMoonShine> Meanwhile: He would kill us all with SCIENCE!
<PonyNegZero> you shoulda dropped a box on one of them

<Very_Silly_Filly> Da
<red_ony> that mod does look nice...
<Chocobunny> Yay.
<Flyboy> Very_Sillt_Filly: yay! another englishman!
<Meanwhile> Let's try and ignore the fact that he's fooling around with corpses...
<Barbetos|Atwork> Compromising positions.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Meanwhile: Um, what
*BronyInstrumental englishman chant!
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile: Hard to do when it's in front of your face.
<red_ony> I actually still have Deus Ex installed :D
<Vordox> Stealthy is AWESOME Mica!
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<BronyInstrumental> CMC englishmen, GO!
<Meanwhile> BronyInstrumental: Dibs on being Sweetie Belle in this analogy.
<AppleEric> did you guys see the 2 songs from season 3?
<sub06905> wasent Phase4 playig this game also?
<BronyInstrumental> i call scootaloo
<Meanwhile> AppleEric: No season 3 info in chat.
<Very_Silly_Filly> AppleEric: Nope, and I'm not going to
<AppleEric> sorry Meanwhile
<Chocobunny> Well, golly. The cloppers are making the rest of us look bad.
<Chocobunny> God damnit.
<Eulshy> jumpyjumpyjumpy
<Very_Silly_Filly> Chocobunny: Welcome to hell
<sub06905> place corpses in boxes
<AttacktheAndalite> Chocobunny: This is news how?
<Meanwhile> Pfft, as if we needed cloppers to look bad.
<PonyNegZero> guess what, bronies are also humans - does that make all humans terrible (moreso than they already are)
<RobertRevenge> Chocobunny: The cloppers have ALWAYS made the rest of us look bad
<sub06905> dem unburnable bixes
<sub06905> boxes*
<Wrek> 05as a amtter of fact
<Wrek> 05this game is mostly eurpean
<sub06905> orly?
<Wrek> 05or french
<Wrek> 05for that matter
<Chocobunny> Wrek is feeling proud.
<Meanwhile> Again, we look pretty bad anyway from an outside perspective.
<CrimsonPhoenix> What do you mean Meanwhile
<Chocobunny> To the rest of the world we're tsundere, no?
<AppleEric> there is porn for every cartoon. every. single. one. and there are people who masturbate to that porn, haters need to stop acting like we are the only ones who do it
<sub06905> not so sneaky
<Meanwhile> We watch a little girls show.
<PonyNegZero> sneaky sneaky BANGBANGBANG!
<valoreins|Drawing> who's howard stern? (sorry not american) :\
<sub06905> sneak points -10
<Chocobunny> Yeah, who is Howard Stern?
<Chocobunny> Sounds like a dick.
<PonyNegZero> slip or mag?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Meanwhile, and?
<PonyNegZero> clip*
<Wrek> 05use painkillers for HP
<Chocobunny> Almost ded.
<Wrek> 05y
<CrimsonPhoenix> Aren't we a groupd that will break that gender stereotype?
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: That reaction isn't the average persons reaction. Their reaction is more along the lines of "What? Really? Pfft."
<PonyNegZero> headshot is credit to kill
<Wrek> 05it'll regen to a 100. but to reach max hp you need painkillers or boosters
<AppleEric> Meanwhile that does not help their arguements at all, as stereotypes are bullshit. if all men and women followed stereotypes, then men would always be drunk, and women would never leave the kitchen
<CrimsonPhoenix> Meanwhile, well that's one goal of Lauren
<sub06905> Louis needs those painkillers
<CrimsonPhoenix> she wanted to break that stereotype
<Meanwhile> Point being that you shouldn't assume we only look bad because of R34.
<Chocobunny> PEELZ HERE
<Eulshy> How did i manage to get 3 rp's at the same time
<Meanwhile> We look bad because by social norms, we're weird.
<Wrek> 05you'd have 125hp
<Wrek> 05if you used it now
<PonyNegZero> I always believe that there is a seed of truth in every stereotype, but that shouldn't reflect upon everyone/everything
<AppleEric> Meanwhile i agree, everything ever has rule34
<CrimsonPhoenix> Mmmmh...
<Chocobunny> One ammo? That doesn't sound correct..
<sub06905> he was going to kill with just one bullet
<Eulshy> Concussion Grenade, do you beat people with it?
<Chocobunny> One bullet sounds more correct.
<valoreins|Drawing> sounds like R34 ruins mlp fandom more than any other fandom don't you think...
<sub06905> he had the golden gun
<Eulshy> Nope
<PonyNegZero> to be fair sum ica did kill them with one headshot a piece...
<Chocobunny> Sub06905: He lives on the edge.
<Lil_B> valoreins|Drawing not really...
<sub06905> Chocobunny: :D
<Meanwhile> Put a concussion grenade on a stick and go demoknight.
<AttacktheAndalite> Omelettes are delicious.
<Chocobunny> Wrek: Can't you stream Mirror's Edge? It's a great game.
<RobertRevenge> AttacktheAndalite: Indeed
<PonyNegZero> katamari domacy!
<sub06905> this game could use more Demopan
*AttacktheAndalite goes to make herself an omelette
<Eulshy> Be Snake
<Wrek> 05played it, didnt like it
<valoreins|Drawing> i mean, r34 animes are so widespread people think it's normal. but mlp... people get butthurt over it...
<Meanwhile> >Mirror's Edge
<Meanwhile> >Great game
<Chocobunny> Wrek: :o
<Meanwhile> Hahahaha no.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh god...
<RobertRevenge> Sumica: You can hack the computer
<AppleEric> you know what i hate?
<Rodney> "Wait a minute, the Society for the Creation of Reasonable Opportunities for Talented but Underdeveloped Mares? Doesn't that shorten to-"
<Wrek> 05Sumica: if oyu get close you can press or hold Q. pressign will knock unconciouss, holdign q will kill.
<Rodney> I lol'd at this line
<Rodney> best fic ever
<Chocobunny> Valoreins: R34 animes? Y'mean hentais?
<Eulshy> You mean porn?
<Wrek> 05using a melee attack will drain 1 energy battery thing under oyur health bar
<TrixieMuffins> even his shneezes are graceful
<sub06905> dis topic
<sub06905> 0-0
<Wrek> 05you currently have 2, but the first will always regenerate
<AppleEric> when i get into a fandom like mlp, or homestuck, and i catch up with all the episodes/pages.
<AppleEric> it makes everything so slow
<Wrek> 05protein bars will regen furtehr past the first one
<Meanwhile> R34, no exceptions.
<valoreins|Drawing> ^
<Chocobunny> Wrek: Can you only stream PC games?
<AppleEric> because i actually have to wait for my episodes/pages
<sub06905> Take computer, u need the money
<Wrek> 05Chocobunny: i hate consoles
<RobertRevenge> Chocobunny: Streaming consoles requires a capture card
<Wrek> 05so you will onyl see me streaming from my PC
<Meanwhile> Amen to that Wrek.
<Eulshy> Congradulations, your now a Facebook level hacker
<Chocobunny> I hate consoles as well, but there are some only-consoles games that are good.
<sub06905> consoles, pcs <3
<Chocobunny> Example : Brütal Legend.
<Chocobunny> Great game.
<Chocobunny> Only console.
<PonyNegZero> parkour!
<Meanwhile> I heard Brütal Legend sucked.
<sub06905> Uncharted is a great game
<Chocobunny> Meanwhile: It's awesome.
<RobertRevenge> Brutal Legend was globbing hilarious
<Wrek> 05yeah Sumica: each "level" will have atleast 1 way to beat it eitehr if you go sneaky, kill or dont kill anyone etc
<Chocobunny> RobertRevenge: You've played it?!
<valoreins|Drawing> and i like dragon's dogma, is the PC version of it out yet?
<RobertRevenge> Chocobunny: Duh, I love Jack Black
<sub06905> Sumica: soon you can turn invisible
<Lil_B> valoreins|Drawingconsoles and PC... I will never understand the war (well, I'll understand why there is a war, but I don't see good arguments)
<Chocobunny> RobertRevenge: I repeat from yesterday, stop becoming more awesome.
<Lil_B> hi ViolaGrey :)
<AppleEric> i just got completely up to date with homestuck, and guess what? its in the middle of a pause, so no new pages for atleast a week
<valoreins|Drawing> Lil_B: all about fanboyism
<Eulshy> Sumica, you have reached hacker level Facebook
<sub06905> lol
<ViolaGrey> hay Lil_B :3
<Vordox> LAWL
<Vordox> Cover marksman
<Meanwhile> Spray and pray.
<Chocobunny> Man down? He became less manly?
<sub06905> there goes that pacifist achievement
<RobertRevenge> I should replay Deus Ex, I still have it downloaded
<valoreins|Drawing> seriously i don't really care about consoles or pc games, i just wanna play a good game
<RobertRevenge> ^
<Chocobunny> Valoreins: Play Brütal Legend.
<Dark_Horst> valoreins|Drawing: chrysis 1
<Meanwhile> Too bad most games these days suck.
<sub06905> he ran away
<Lil_B> valoreins|Drawing There are Pros and Cons for both, but both are around for years now and that proofs that these Pros and Cons are rather well balanced
<Chocobunny> Meanwhile: There are gems, however.
<sub06905> yup
<Eulshy> He became invisab;e
<Lil_B> so its really just personal opinion
<Meanwhile> Call of Duty 7 Revenge of the Return of the Lens Flare. HD.
<Wrek> 05its equipped
<ekips> Sumica you can even kill people with vending machines later on :3
<Wrek> 05g throws it
<Chocobunny> Meanwhile: Release date?
<sub06905> soon you can take vending machines and throw them at people
<Eulshy> Meow

<killerpony7733> RobertRevenge: Eulshy You may wan't to discuss these type of things, Somewhere not here
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: nope, its a bio.detector, not a camera
<RobertRevenge> killerpony7733: Awwh, why not? I don't know where else I could talk with them. :<
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: it only notices jensens
<Dark_Horst> or not
<Dark_Horst> funny, i dont remember that
<Eulshy> yay
<killerpony7733> RobertRevenge: Cause it's a kinda mature topic, Also theres channels for it or you could talk in PM

<PonyNegZero> help I've fallen and I can't get up!
<sub06905> disregard hostages, drink beer
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: you'll need a ventilation shaft to get in
<Dark_Horst> at least that'S what i remember
<ekips> if you are quick enough you can disarm the bomb once you are in
<killerpony7733> ekips: Or shoot the canisters on it

<ekips> I...never thought of that
<killerpony7733> Nurse_Major: Didn't you know?
<Eulshy> What? Did you just shoot it and it broke?
<sub06905> bullets solve everything
<Nurse_Major> killerpony7733: would you exspect to shoot a bomb to disable it?
<PonyNegZero> sub06905: bullet logic does work
<killerpony7733> Nurse_Major: Nope, But i knew this beforehand thus why i said he should shoot it
<Dark_Horst> oh look, it'S the two-umdangerous-liquids-become-explosive-when-mixed-bomb from die hard

<Dark_Horst> we do not hear your magnificent voice
<Eulshy> yay

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Superbrony has before.
<Everlasting_Joy> All right, I need to take off folks.
<AttacktheAndalite> Bye Everlasting_Joy
<Sumica> 00,10so basicly what I did get was lag the network by taking over useless dead ends first
<StupidSexyCJ> later Everlasting_Joy
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: fortify nodes that you took over
<Wrek> 05dont forget to fortify them ocne you cap them to slow down the tracer
<Wrek> 05but ill teach you a trick sumi
<Wrek> 05on this one
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: it heightens their rating, the higher the rating, the slower the anti virus can take over
<Wrek> 05as you capture the node with a 2 at it, fortify your IO port
<Wrek> 05go directly for the one after that
<Wrek> 05then capture the big red thign
<Wrek> 05and it will give you everythign on the network
<Vordox> Only if you can reach the IO :P
<Vordox> Some are one way
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> What 6_9
<Dark_Horst> dont foregt the cube
<Dark_Horst> the cube contains neat shit
<Eulshy> up up down down left right left right b a select start
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ah
<Wrek> 05only works if the connection is 2 way on the security red thingie
<Wrek> 05so you cant alwasy jstu go for it
<Wrek> 05turn off the cam
*Darkts3|Drawing|MLG will never understand the hacking system

<Wrek> 05and yes sumi, if you get the heavy lifting aug together with robot domination
<Wrek> 05you can convert that turrent and carry it around as it shoots stuff
<FairysHuff> I stupidly told my doctor of some mental health issues I've been having and may end up going bye bye.

<AttacktheAndalite> I'm fine. And you?
<sub06905|Dead_Island> alexxm: im doind good you?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have GB chips
<Very_Silly_Filly> Your argument is invalid
<valoreins|Drawing> alexxm: just meditating to the inner side of my soul to find a real answer of life from this: http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/351/723/bfb.png
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: take the box. fun things in the boxes
<alexxm> i'm good AttacktheAndalite and Very_Silly_Filly
<sub06905|Dead_Island> win
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'd say Vinyl, she's the least seen so far
<Dark_Horst> but you did
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: the upper right one
<Dark_Horst> oh yeah, and hacking gives esp
<Dark_Horst> *exp
<Wrek> 05here id say go straight for the goal
<Wrek> 05fortify as you capture
<Wrek> 05you can fortify everythign that you capture
<Dark_Horst> ^
<killerpony7733> Dat DX1 unatco theme!!!!
<sub06905|Dead_Island> well i am completly bucked in dead island
<valoreins|Drawing> Very_Silly_Filly: i dunno, tavia and vinyl is seen once in a season, but yeah still the least
<Meanwhile> You were completely bucked when you bought Dead Island.
<Dark_Horst> you're toasr
<sub06905|Dead_Island> but i like dead island :<
<Wrek> 05also sumi: if nodes are already taken by the system
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Dead Island is Borderlands, but with more and more zombies
<Wrek> 05no need to go for them unless they are crucial for the goal
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: how come?
<Meanwhile> Because Dead Island is another generic zombie game.
<Wrek> 05goal is green circle
<Wrek> 05sphere*
<Dark_Horst> generic? you must confuse it with soemthing
<Vordox> Wrek: Data boxes
<valoreins|Drawing> still better than generic action hollywood style shooting zombie games
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: shits and giggles. also, sometimes there COULD be something useful in an email
<Meanwhile> valoreins|Drawing: Oh easily, just not that great on it's own merit.
<Wrek> 05sicne you cant capture the red box
<Wrek> 05the game stores all email your read
<Wrek> 05in your tab menu
<Meanwhile> Wrek is like the Na'vi of Deus Ex, only far more useful.
<Vinco> Hello, everyone
<Meanwhile> Allo Vinco.
<valoreins|Drawing> ohai Vinco
<AttacktheAndalite> Hi Vinco
<Wrek> 05well each time you hack you get xp
<Wrek> 05so you are technically doign it right
<Wrek> 05soften makes it easier and faster to convert nodes
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: rule of thumb: do EVERYTHING
<Vordox> THERE
<Vordox> CAP THE Sub Routine
<valoreins|Drawing> and it's midnight here, time for me to rest, baii everypony :)
<Vordox> The red one!

*RobertRevenge yawns loudly.
<Vinco> alexxm: how are you?
<alexxm> i'm good Vinco
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> good night valoreins|Drawing
<Kandarihu> Hey, I remember seeing that e-mail before... the one about rules for plant security, and the last one is about never playing shareware games on company computers
<Wrek> 05ok soften is the one that gets lower tetection percentages
<Vordox> Data storage = Bonus item/Exp
<Wrek> 05transfer is speed
<Bronysith> okay morrowind is pretty good
<Wrek> 05see?
<Wrek> 05one now has 0
<Wrek> 05makes it muuuch faster to cap
<Dark_Horst> actually, soften lowers every node by one, tranfer juggles them
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hm
<Dark_Horst> transfer takes rating from one node, and puts it somewher else
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hmm, that was delicious, yum yum
<Meanwhile> Dark_Horst: What if we take the node rating, and push it somewhere else?
<Wrek> 05lold
<Dark_Horst> we shoudl totaly do that
<Vinco> Meanwhile: I was thinking the same thing
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Meanwhile: XD
<Kandarihu> Now's a good time to go for the box
<Dark_Horst> THE CUBE
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh R.I.P Mermaid Man
<Wrek> 05i say cap cube
<Wrek> 05adn then cap goal
<Wrek> 05use a nuke virus
<alexxm> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG what killed him
<Dark_Horst> and while it'S capping, fortify your stuff
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> alexxm: something about a bad kidney
<alexxm> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG damn was it at least peaceful then
<Very_Silly_Filly> Right, that;'s enough loitering and raseing around, back to work for me
<Wrek> 05scrool wheel zooms out

<BronyInstrumental> for what reeezon?
<AttacktheAndalite> All I know is that it's been about a year and a half
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i would just like to say this in here: in the last year, my life has changed in so many ways that would have been unfathomable to me when i first started watching the show. i've done things that i wouldn't have dreamed, i've made so many new friends, my outlook on life has changed a lot, i've become more confident and less socially awkward, and i've had an absolutely rollicking time being involved in this community
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sumica: What's that, a mod?
<Sumica> 00,10what mod?
<Chocobunny> All the good ebay Dashie plushes cost so much..
<Very_Silly_Filly> You.
<Sumica> 00,10oh no a brony
<Nurse_Major> Saturn: and without this community I would have never found my soulmate :)
<Chocobunny> I hate you Hasbro for making those disgusting pony merchandise.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ahh
<Saturn> 08,01my life has become very strange since then, and i'm still weirded out by some aspects of what i do day-to-day now (read: most con-related things)
<Nurse_Discord> 11,01My mod birthday isn't for another 8 months?
<Very_Silly_Filly> 1 year and 2 days I joined this site :)
<Nurse_Major> Nurse_Discord: :P

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> what?
<Saturn> 08,01but i just want to say thank you in particular to everyone on here; bronystate is a massive part of my life now, and i even think i'd have been able to start the con without it. you guys are the best community i've ever been part of, and i love you all dearly

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wr3k should play some happy wheels
<Meanwhile> The guy who made this travelled back in time and became Hitler.
<MASF123> Robbaz should definately check this game out.
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Eveyrthing you see kills yo, everything you don't see kills you, here play. :P
<BronyInstrumental> gah i can't work out how to use adobe media encoder
*MakerDusk is best maker
<MakerDusk> :p
<Kandarihu> I know, I know
<Meanwhile> MakerDusk is best Dusk.
*Panda-Store makes MakerDusk
<Vordox> Does he really need to use the Grap there?
<Pork_Chop> Has anyone even tried to think what the use of the building he is jumping on is?
<MASF123> Look at this ad on the stream..Russian Girls. WTF.
<Pork_Chop> Like really what
<Meanwhile> Barrel and fish warehouse?
<Vordox> MASF123: We're in hard times
<Kandarihu> You know, there's one thing in this game that doesn't kill you, where other games might. Falling damage.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> MASF123:lol

<Saturn> 08,01finally
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Pork_Chop: They're guarding Barrels silly
<Pork_Chop> Ok well that makes sense I guess
<Meanwhile> Deeeeeerp
<Saturn> 08,01the Brony Thank You Fund are doing something i can really, honestly get behind: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/07/brony-thank-you-fund-announces-calarts.html
<Vordox> Although
<Vordox> This looks more like a game so far, more ever then IWBTG
<Saturn> 08,01they have just become absolutely awesome in my mind
<Pork_Chop> So this game is about a fish lover trying to destroy guard towers protecting a barrel warehouse
<Saturn> 08,01from asinine to awesome in 10 seconds flat
<MASF123> I would donate if I had money...or a job.
<Pork_Chop> We must make a movie of this NOW
<Meanwhile> Saturn: I was expecting an innuendo tbh.
<Vordox> Saturn: You...had benefit of doubt or already resented their ideas?
<Wrek> 05and i give up for the day
<Wrek> 05lets play somethin easy
<Sumica> 00,10it's just not the same with out hearing wrek rage

<Pork_Chop> OMFG
<Vordox> That was very easy game :P Just traps
<Meanwhile> Sounds legit.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wrek: by maybe 5 seconds
<Shamroc> Pork_Chop: GOOD GOD WE DONT CARE!
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: i hated their original thing of making that advert on The Hub
<Pork_Chop> D:
<Saturn> 08,01i still hate it
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Wrek beat TB.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol 100 friends
<Saturn> 08,01i think it's stupid at best, creepy at worst
<MASF123> HADOKEN!
<Saturn> 08,01and asinine throughout
<Kandarihu> Are you going to play Tribes: Ascend?
<Kandarihu> Awwww
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Kandarihu: he cant, its bugging out
<Pork_Chop> YAYA
<Vordox> Saturn: A simple gravel rock can start an avalanche
<Vordox> :P
<Pork_Chop> Tf2
<Sumica> 00,10now to see if I can fix the rim of sky
<Saturn> 08,01but funding a scholarship at calarts... that's just phenomenal. i love that. i really love that they'd do taht.
<sub06905|Dead_Island> tf2
<Pork_Chop> I shall now play tf2
<Saturn> 08,01i'm a firm believer in making education accessible
<CriticKitten> Calarts? As in, the California Institute of the Arts? o.O Wow.
<MakerDusk> me as well, Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01i think education is *the* most important thing, in many respects
<Meanwhile> Of all the important things that could happen, this is The. Most. Important. Thing!
<MakerDusk> it's the only thing that's important
<Saturn> 08,01i actually... i have plans for my career which intend to shake up the education system in this country
<MakerDusk> says the physicist
<Saturn> 08,01big plans
<Saturn> 08,01whether i can actually do what i intend to is another matter
<BronyInstrumental> well if you do it within the next 5 years it'll affect me, Saturn ^_^
<MakerDusk> well, you have at least one person on your side ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01but i think education in the UK is ridiculous
<MASF123> @Wrek, I've never asked you this question before, but I always have myself needing to ask you this particular question but have always felt so nervous to ask you...Do you mind if I ask you this question Wrek?
<Saturn> 08,01and the US is worse
<BronyInstrumental> you're telling ME saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01by god, US education system...
<Shamroc> MASF123: that question question..
<Saturn> 08,01even *i* don't know where to start there
<Saturn> 08,01scrap it
<Saturn> 08,01scrap it all
<Wrek> 05how should i know? i dont know the question
<MakerDusk> canada is bad too
<Saturn> 08,01throw it out, start again
<Pork_Chop> Lol
<MASF123> What is your favorite pony @Wrek?
<MakerDusk> the main problem are the institutions
<red_ony> you can always come over to Germany, where (most) of the education is (almost) free...;)
<Pork_Chop> Twilight is my guess
<Saturn> 08,01i don't even know if the US system *can* be fix
<MakerDusk> you'd have to start from scratch in north america
<MakerDusk> Saturn: nope
<Saturn> 08,01it woudl rely on the country as a whole being fixed
<Shamroc> MASF123...its...twi...do you really have to ask? you could of just gone to the info page
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> lol
<Vinco> Saturn: We need the metric system
<Saturn> 08,01and honestly, i think the best thing that can happen to america is for all the clever people to evacuate, and nuke the whole site from orbit
<MakerDusk> Saturn: not necisarily
<CrimsonPhoenix> no
<CrimsonPhoenix> NO
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH GOD NO
<Saturn> 08,01seriously, america, your country is a mess
<MASF123> I don't normally check that out, I've looked at the info page like once.
<Meanwhile> It'll take more than the metric system to fix you.
<CrimsonPhoenix> THEY ARE BACK
<MakerDusk> not if it was offered by a corporation
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://see.walmart.com/furby?cid=sbo.320.1456
<Pork_Chop> @Saturn where are you from
<red_ony> pony politics..
<CrimsonPhoenix> FURBIES
<Saturn> 08,01Pork_Chop: Scotland
<MASF123> Ok...well that explains it.
<Pork_Chop> Ahh
<Vinco> Meanwhile: I mean in addition to all the other stuff
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Saturn: dont tread on US >: (
<red_ony> aren't you voting on your independence soon?
<Saturn> 08,01oh, i'm not being literal
<Maid_Discord> 11,01How do your teachers get paid?
<Kandarihu> Saturn, our system is easier to fix than the U.K.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Saturn: i knows silly
<Saturn> 08,01i don't literally want to nuke the states
<MASF123> Dat Steam?
<Meanwhile> Stab.
<Saturn> 08,01i'm just saying that it needs a huge shake up
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: i'm sorry hun, but it really isn't
<Sumica> 00,10So is sater trying to start shit?
<Saturn> 08,01not your whole government, system, and culture
<MASF123> Takes 4 ever to boot...
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, this isn't the place to tlak politics
<MakerDusk> Saturn: once again, you know at least one physicist ;)
<Maid_Discord> 11,01US Govt needs a reboot. Ban lobbying.
<Meanwhile> Und dann Wrek was Rarity.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Oh.
<Pork_Chop> Eish
<Saturn> 08,01i can get rahter... enthusiastic about politics
<MakerDusk> and I have branched out in my field
<Pork_Chop> Eish my bru
<alexxm> so from i wanna be the guy to team fortress
<Saturn> 08,01MakerDusk: two if i count myself
<MakerDusk> XD
<Saturn> 08,01well, one and a half
<MASF123> Who is the one to the right?
<MakerDusk> how's your nuclear physics and high explosives geometry?
<MASF123> I mean left... :)
<cratorkid> genorosity? he must be rarity
<Kandarihu> We just need to return to our spiritual roots and figure out how to prevent the country from going so wrong the way it did.
<MASF123> Is she smoking a blunt?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> ?
<Kandarihu> Hmm, invisibility contacts, I guess.
<Meanwhile> Dat medic.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :$ OMG OMG Deadpool is getting his own game, Marvel's Pinkie Pie is gettin his OWN game :D awesome /)^3^(\
<Kandarihu> Or is it an invisibility scarf? Whatever.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: Kick big business out. It's corporate lobbying that's screwing us up.
<Flutterswag> hay
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Hi Flutterswag
<MASF123> Heavy is ready.
<Flutterswag> :)
<Vordox> Maid_Discord: It'smore the that
<Pork_Chop> Damn, whats the Ip for this server
<Pork_Chop> if its not private
<Vordox> Maid_Discord: Please don't start politics here
<Vordox> tD:
<Kandarihu> I'm sure you're thinking the entertainment industry, right?
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I won't.
<Vordox> I did a few times and it caused hell
<MASF123> Anypony ever heard of Poker Night in the Inventory?
<Pork_Chop> Yes
<MASF123> The Heavy plays Poker there apparently.
<Pork_Chop> Yeah he does
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Wrek gets Rarity a lot.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Wonder if he ever played as Twily.
<MASF123> With Max, Strong Bad, and....Tycho??? :O
<TheHoodyNinja> Is Wrek streaming?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Maid_Discord: he probably doesnt xD
<TheHoodyNinja> and hai everypony
<Meanwhile> MASF123: Got it when it came out, amusing little aside.
<MASF123> Yeah @Wrek is Streaming.
<Vordox> Maid_Discord: Nerf Pyros and Rarity
<Kandarihu> If we're going to forbid big corporations from lobbying, then we're going to have to do the same to small companies, and everything else. Equal protection goes both ways.
<Vordox> Maid_Discord: Then I'll come back to PF2
<TheHoodyNinja> yes got it right
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I've never played PF2.
<Meanwhile> Dat Pyro
<MASF123> Dat Applejack

<Pork_Chop> Pyros... EISH
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Two Raritys.

<MaidMoonShine> The voice in the dark shall guide us!
<Dken2021> yay!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: how did that happen?
<Lil_B> Phase4 suddenly everything borked
<Alchemist> but if we have two hearts, they are connected. If one blows up it wont matter we have another one because the system is open and it would just pump the blood into the tissue
<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, i was shifthing partitions around, and i misplaced my lvm volume
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Phase4 accidentally Linux.

<AttacktheMaid> I hate when it looks like it's about to rain.
<Maidwhile> Maroon 5. Goddamn.
<MaidMoonShine> His fluttershy voice is amazing
<Lil_B> Alchemist hmm... the mody would have to close all connections to the broken heard at once :/
<SkylerArmor> this guy can sing, play and do voice acting? nice.
*Phase4 00,02hugs Rain
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Under severe thunderstorm warning last night.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> what are the trilogies being shown tonight?
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: did you hear the massive whoosh that went through here? i did
<Dovah> in fallout new vegas how do i get the people of goodsprings to stop shunning me so i can start the quest there?
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Dreamed of being hit by a mile-wide tornado last night.
<Maidwhile> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Check the newsletter.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01It was fun.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Maidwhile: thats a sign of laziness, but fine
<owlicious> call upon the pegasi
<Maidwhile> -_-
<maidlicious> no wait, get the pegasi to stop
*Maid_Discord 11,01stretches his wings
<Dken2021> I can hear the bass a bit
<Alchemist> Lil_B: I dont think even that would help, because then it created a blockage, the blood cant pass through.
<maidlicious> cloudsdale doesn't need more water
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Maid_Discord: did you get to see a witch?
<Phase4> 00,02and then interderp
<MaxTheBrony> I love this song :)
<MaxTheBrony> Did anyone here catch what gigas Youtube was?
<Lil_B> Alchemist yeah... I think the broked heart would have to get removed imiediatley
<Maidwhile> MaxTheBrony: Hang on, I'll find it for you.
<Alchemist> Lil_B: anyways Im far too ignorant about the human circulatory system to have a meaningful conversation about it :D
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Wut?
<MaxTheBrony> Maidwhile: Thank you :)
<String_Shredder> the bass sounds a little out of tune
<maidlicious> maybe if we put the hearts pumping in parallel
<Lil_B> Alchemist dito :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Maid_Discord: Wizard of Oz Reference silly
<Maid_Discord> 11,01If one heart of a two-heart system failed, it would be extra work on the still-working heart.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Oh.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Maid_Discord: so 2 hearts in one heart?
<Waffles> lol
<MaxTheBrony> xD

<Maidwhile> all upon the tuner ponies, when you're in distress
<DashWithRainbows> Maidwhile Nope. I only have Rain and the friend who helped me pay for the game. Seeing as I only had TF2 and I don't play that very often, I didn't really bother with adding others on steam.
<alexxm> i have no idea
<Butler_sub06905> Vinyl Scratch took it
<MaxTheBrony> I dont know why but his voice remind me of MJ :)
<maidlicious> you could try online tuners

<dshannon> whistles
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka: you sure love your rain
<Maidwhile> DWR: Think I found you.
<DeadCanary> ...What. The fook.
<FairysHuff> Side note - I saw my doctor today and finally told her some stuff I had been holding back for years. So if you don't hear from me for a long time it'll be because I've been sectioned.
<CupcakeExtreme01> Hi, whats on? All I have is a black screen :'(
<Maidwhile> Allo DeadCanary. Why're you dead?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> CupcakeExtreme01: songs

<DeadCanary> Because Maidwhile.
<GilDash> FairysHuff: You're not going to be sectioned. :S
<MaidMoonShine> Hey FairysHuff :)
<Lil_B> You turn me right round like a I forgot the text
<MaidMoonShine> And thus the epic quest to find the bass tuner began
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Maidwhile> DeadCanary: Because me? D:
<DashWithRainbows> Oh really? Did you use that... um... BS google doc with users steam names, xbox GT's and what not?
<DeadCanary> I freaking suck.
<DeadCanary> No.
<Maidwhile> DeadCanary: Well that's just not true.
*DeadCanary spits out water
<CupcakeExtreme01> lol
<FairysHuff> GilDash I hope your right ~_~ For an isolationist like myself that would be the worst thing.

<Yahooz> amongst other things :p
<Pudge> Skyrim
<Pudge> clearly

<CriticKitten> No interest in CoD, already have Skyrim.
<Barbetos1> That is the answer to everything
<Reikim> Although I've had good convos on Manechat
<Firelight> I HAVE NO MEMORY
<StinkomanFan> We gonna stream the Harry Potter franchise?
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, hopefully the one that's 75% off. Hopefully it's not CoD
<StinkomanFan> At all?
<Yahooz> they come up once in a while
<Reikim> Like that one time we all argued with Vordox about math, and then philosophy
<Reikim> And then art.
<owloysius> prince-dari: welcome, and for the love of celestia, not the face
<Barbetos1> StinkomanFan NEVER!!

<Vordox> Firelight: You just glance and think you know it?
<Reikim> Vordox was complaining about "modern" art.
<Kandarihu> I wouldn't mind if it's Skyrim... but being less than 75% off makes it a waste of a deal. I'm voting for DXHR
<Meanwhile> Ah well.
<Firelight> lol..... fine i'll watch it god damnit .lol
<Vordox> i'm seeing HUGe potential here
<Meanwhile> That I can understand.
<Reikim> I had to explain to him the difference between modernism and whatever the hell they call today's art.
<Yahooz> art is beauty in perspective

<Shizuka> 13that thing
<Insane__> Yay...
<BaconLurker> 0,5Shizuka: SO did I ;____;
<Shizuka> 13needs more railings
<ponibas> shizu is best
<Meanwhile> In my opinion, yes.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why is there coke covering the ground?
*Iron_Waffle opens up a can of Brisk
<Reikim> Jesus now we're into "what is art".
<rockytoppie85> Vordox: So whats it to you :D
<CriticKitten> WAY more railings.
<Meanwhile> Baby don't hurt me.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Is it only art if it's real, or imgened?
<FUS_RO_yay> This movie needs more Parkour and Ponies.
<prince-dari> Nittany_Discord: Das a lot of coke
<Insane__> I can't talk anymore
<prince-dari> :P
<Shizuka> 13like a hundred more railings before that thing is safe
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Is this a junkie dream?
<Vordox> rockytoppie85: Nothing, I'm just happy your parents aren't covering you from the world. :P
<Petrified_Discord> Drop, you'll be fine
<Insane__> LIIIIEEEEES
<CriticKitten> That thing isn't remotely secure enough.
<Bronysith> sarsaparilla is a root beer. who woulda guessed
<fluttercry> 05,15Because Charile Sheen was there
<owloysius> where was gondor when you needed more railings
<robokun> you'd think they would maintain a fire escape or whatever that is
<Meanwhile> Art is interpretation of soul.
<prince-dari> Winning?
<StinkomanFan> CriticKitten, no kill like overkill
<ponibas> and structural reinforcement
<Reikim> Long story short, I've written essays on the topic, let's not get into it =.=
<otakon> Shizuka: more like 200
<Dumorimasoddaa> Same
<Shizuka> 13assassin's creed: switzerland
<otakon> GODDAMMIT STOP LAGGING!
<StinkomanFan> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF- MY VERTIGO
<dr-whooves> poor otakon
<robokun> time to free fall!
<Nyria> otakon: So it was lag~
<Dumorimasoddaa> I did a medium length theis
<Tovler> inb4 1 bloody snow angel
<ponibas> otakon, dude, is your net gerbil powered or something?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and I'm freeeee
<CriticKitten> Oh.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14free falling
<Kandarihu> rockytoppie85, I hope your parents are supervising you on here. Some of us are nice. Others aren't so much.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They need to fix that escape.
<Vordox> ponibas: Chicken Power
<CriticKitten> I get it.
<otakon> ponibas: you know that is Meanwhile's schtick right?
<rockytoppie85> Vordox: okay... my whol class is like this... exeptc crazy...all of us are.
<CriticKitten> He's Spiderman.
<Iron_Waffle> My computer is a dinosaur
<Shizuka> 13if i remember the commentary right, that scene was all matt damon
<Vinco> Dat landing
<Meanwhile> I have never written anything longer than 2 pages. Deal w/ it.
<Reikim> Anyway, I think the conclusion I came to was that art is an attempt at communication.
<dr-whooves> SLOW DOWN THE CAHT I CANT KEEP UP
<Iron_Waffle> I use XP. :P
<Shizuka> 13with safety nets obviously but i think he did his own stunts for that
<Meanwhile> otakon: eh?
<robokun> ponibas: i'm now imagining a computer with wires going to a few hundred gerbil wheels
<ponibas> well, it as either geerbils or carrier pigeon
<fluttercry> 05,15Longest thing I ever wrote was 12 pages
<Tovler> damn skippy
<otakon> Meanwhile: gerbil powered internet and all that
<SaxyPretender> 0,1410 or so pages
<kidzrul434> what the buck is this?
<owloysius> nah, he can't afford gerbils. Probably mice
<rockytoppie85> if somone mean comes on, ill just leave.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14footnotes saved the day
<Reikim> Mostly because I felt like including music, dance, theatre, and writing in my definition.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wrote a 50-page thesis.
<otakon> ponibas: carrier pigeon is extinct
<Vordox> rockytoppie85: Look at the world, create your opinion, be a thinker, don't look away from stuff unless you wish, create the world how you want
<rockytoppie85> easy enough... right?
<SirGanjalf> dat Mini
<Shizuka> 13DIE TASCHE!
<ponibas> details :p
<Vordox> That's the priviledge for you younger generations rockytoppie85
<Shizuka> 13i hope there's 100,000 deutsch marks inside
<StinkomanFan> "I LIKE YOUR CAR"
<otakon> rockytoppie85: good attitude to have, but welcome and enjoy the movie :)
<kidzrul434> what is this?
<StinkomanFan> BRB
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I hope there's 99 luftbalons
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And then had to throw half of it out.
<otakon> kidzrul434: it's The Bourne Identity
<otakon> isn't it?
<ponibas> yes
<Reikim> Impressive.
<Shizuka> 13there's probably like one person here that gets my reference..
<prince-dari> Jason Bourne: Shut up and take my money
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Run lola Run?
<Meanwhile> otakon: Internet crafted by a long dead race of humanoids who now skulk the inside of the earth in blind rage more like.
<rockytoppie85> Okay...just stop talking about my age and awtch the movie.
<Shizuka> 13but i like money :<
<Reikim> Wait, why are we having an essay-size competition?
<lunac> they end up married
<ponibas> Idiocracy!@
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Rough draft was 80 pages. A lot of it was thrown out.
<Petrified_Discord> Now kiss!
<Vordox> Shizuka: Dem rules are guidelines, but not to be followed unless shown other circumstances, no?
<SirGanjalf> SaxyPretender: Yep, she was in that movie
<CriticKitten> xD
<ponibas> I like money
<rockytoppie85> ive seen 11 year olds cussing and stuff. im like. wth
<Obsidian> Money solves all problems
<Iron_Waffle> MONIES
<Meanwhile> Because when you don't get laid that often you compare thesis size.
<FUS_RO_yay> lunac: No spoilers/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like Shizuka <3
<SirGanjalf> In fact, she was title character
<Reikim> :D
<Tovler> wow, I literally thought Borne was Mark Wahlberg
<Meanwhile> (I'm kidding, of course. Before one of you overreacts)
<lunac> FUS_RO-yay most have already seen this or read the book by now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm a virgin.
<Vordox> lunac: I haven't
<rockytoppie85> I have nothing to do.
<FUS_RO_yay> ;lunac me neither
<rockytoppie85> what comes on next?
<Reikim> So is that what doctorate students do when they're not getting laid?
<ponibas> don't bet on that
*Dumorimasoddaa is anything but
<rockytoppie85> yawn*
<Kandarihu> Vordox, it's the responsibility of parents to protect their children from harm. And that does include corrupting influences. And there ARE corrupting influences in this IRC and on the stream. The ponies are fine. Certain fanworks, maybe not so much. There are M-Rated games streamed on here sometimes, as well.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So, yeah, I have to throw thesis size around.
<prince-dari> SirGanjalf: He was talking about the "Die tasche" and 100k marks reference specifically though. :P
<FUS_RO_yay> lunac: you get the point, i havent.
<Iron_Waffle> Anybody here read cupcakes>
<Firelight> What people will do for jsut one person.
<Twilight_Spark> Which borne is this?
<Meanwhile> Well, if it's 50 pages it might hurt a bit.
<Petrified_Discord> C'mon guys, type on those 1990's keyboards!
<lunac> It;;s also predictable as adubuting women in hollywpood always equals marriage
<Vordox> Corrupting?
<ponibas> identitiy
<SirGanjalf> Twilight_Spark: First
<StinkomanFan> Barcelona! Like the Queen song!
<Vordox> ARE YOU SPEAKING ABOTU BLOODY CORRUPTION!?
<cratorkid> sleeper cells activated*
<Reikim> That's okay. There are plenty of people who can't throw thesis size around either.
<Twilight_Spark> Thanks!
<Sumica> 00,10odd, I cant load the steam store page
<Vordox> Oh god... I'm about to blow up..
<SirGanjalf> ohai Clive Owen
<rockytoppie85> i have m rated games uch as halo call of duty of course i dont play them alot though...
<Kandarihu> Vordox, you don't value innocence, do you?
<CriticKitten> Sumi: Probably just high traffic
<Tovler> mmmm Hamburg
<dr-whooves> Kandahrihu: TL;DR
<otakon> is that Steve Carell?
<owloysius> odd, i can
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Innocense is created by influences.
<Meanwhile> Pfft, I can't throw either around.
<RobertRevenge> Kandarihu: Innocence is overrated
<Sumica> 00,10no it like loads to my page instead
<Reikim> And 50 pages could qualify as a blunt weapon.
<Iron_Waffle> Has anybody else here read cupcakes?
<StinkomanFan> They're sending Mister Bean after him?
<Sumica> 00,10the comunity one
<Vordox> Not created from lies and deiceit.
<otakon> Sumica: hmm I'm still downloading Magicka myself
<HatsuneMikuFan> You're have the same problem too?
<otakon> Iron_Waffle: no and don't plan to
<owloysius> Sumica: try http://store.steampowered.com ?
<AttacktheAndalite> Iron_Waffle: We don't talk about that round these here parts.
<RobertRevenge> Iron_Waffle: We don't discuss Cupcakes here
<rockytoppie85> I watch streams of people playing things like Amnesia and other things.... stop worrying about me and watch the movie
<SaxyPretender> 0,14not about the size of the thesis
<dr-whooves> Iron_waffle: DO NOT TALK ABOUT IT
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's all about the content
<dr-whooves> But the answer is yes
<lunac> lol
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: try going to your games list on your profile and follow one to store page, that should reset it
<Tovler> The Shining?
<SirGanjalf> dat winter sights
<owloysius> we can reference it, read the rules
<Shizuka> 13i've had that happen sometimes
<rockytoppie85> Ill be going for now.
<Kandarihu> Iron_Waffle, I know that Cupcakes and the pony.mov videos are off limits here. They will never be seen here, thankfully.
<owloysius> or just wing it
<SirGanjalf> *dem
<Vordox> rockytoppie85: See ya Rocky
<Petrified_Discord> Oh my god is she still talking?

<Obsidian> Eulshy: The Bourne Identity
<Kandarihu> rockytoppie85, I hope I haven't scared you off.
<fluttercry> 05,15I go to a community college even though I was accepted to several good schools. Why? Because I didn't want to leave home yet. Now that's sad.
<Sumica> 00,10guess they dont count when hl2 came out and I set up on it then
<Vordox> rockytoppie85: /)
<Meanwhile> SaxyPretender: "Size doesn't matter it's how you use it" ?
<RobertRevenge> Ohai Eulshy! <3
<rockytoppie85> no, im just bored :D
<Kandarihu> Some of us are nice, too.
*SaxyPretender taps his nose
<Shizuka> 13OH GOD SHE TURNED ON THE JUSTIN BIEBER
<prince-dari> Wut, one of the games boats randomly generated audio, visuals, and events. How is that possible
<Barbetos> he likes dubstep
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SaxyPretender: That's actually true.
<rockytoppie85> i cant do the brohoof vordox it wont let me ... so ill jsut do *brohoof*
<rockytoppie85> bye!
<SirGanjalf> chiptune?
<rockytoppie85> :D
<Sumica> 00,10what game dari?
<Vordox> I have SERIOUS issues with "Corruption" bullcrap that every parent(Good or bad) takes up
<Tovler> Shadowrun was announced and hyped at Comic con and that game ended up being crap.
<Vordox> -_:
<prince-dari> "Dear Esther"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I consider mine crap.
<Reikim> Meanwhile: No, size doesn't matter. It's how long it lasts. Ask Twilight. As long as the book has a good plot, she doesn't care about its length.
<Shizuka> 13um he does obviously
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so
<Iron_Waffle> I honestly don't listen to music.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14much

<Meanwhile> ^
<Twilight_Spark> So my first bronystate movie is Bourne. Not bad I suppose
<SaxyPretender> 0,14either that or my mind is in the gutter >.>
<dr-whooves> Irone_Waffle: GTFO
<Shizuka> 13prince-dari: oh, dear esther is basically one big boring interactive movie
<otakon> me neither really
<CriticKitten> Fuck it, we'll do it live!
<Reikim> No, all our minds are in the gutter.
<Vordox> Twilight_Spark: Nice Touhou Reference
<Bronysith> SaxyPretender: isnt that where everyones mind is?
<Reikim> You find a lot of toonies there.
<robokun> Tovler: I still see a decent amount of people playing Shadowrun when I boot it up
<StinkomanFan> Fun fact: The average monopoly set has $20,300 dollars in it.
<Sumica> 00,10was that the thing that was playing last night?
<prince-dari> Ahh, meh. I was thinking it was some kind of puzzle game.
<Vordox> Shizuka: Yet it won awards?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My mind is always in the gutter.
<Iron_Waffle> dr-whooves: no u
<Twilight_Spark> Thanks!
<otakon> prince-dari: it's more exploration
<Shizuka> 13the guy pulled a lot of tricks out of source to do it, but it's otherwise wholesale lifted from like a 2007 mod
<Sumica> 00,10the guy that would not shut up
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wrote my thesis with a gutter mind.
<Twilight_Spark> :)
<Meanwhile> Chat is in the gutter.
<dr-whooves> Iron_Waffle: NO U
<Shizuka> 13oh did someone do wtf is dear esther?
<Shizuka> 13gutter baaaaall
<Iron_Waffle> dr-whooves DDDAATAIGHIAFANGASFOIN
<otakon> oh Amnesia is on sale
<Reikim> Actually, I think chat fell out of the gutter and into the sewage system.
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Lots of games win awards. >_>
<FUS_RO_yay> When Ii was in Preschool we used monopoly money as a type of currency.
<Shizuka> 13elf elf baby
<otakon> lol
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Yeah but awards doesn't say it's great.
<robokun> ZOOM AND ENHANCE! *derp*
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I no clean that
<Barbetos> Where is this enhance feature that all computers have in movies?
<Kandarihu> Man, this whole drama over Rockie totally distracted me from the movie.
<Barbetos> Why doesn't my computer have it?
<Shizuka> 13actually fun fact, we're getting close to enhance mode
<StinkomanFan> ZOOM AND INPANTS
<otakon> brb
<CriticKitten> Vordox: There are so many awards nowadays they're starting to become meaningless. There's like ten different "Game of the Year" ones.
<saiga> those crts look old now
<fluttercry> 05,15Barbetos, you have to delete system 32 to use it.
<dr-whooves> ^This
<Vordox> CriticKitten: INdeed. It's a Hype machine
*Nittany_Discord 11,01goes deep
<Shizuka> 13there was a paper released recently taking like a 100x100 image and blowing it up to 500x500 with sharp detail

<Reikim> Wait. I saw Dear Esther mentioned. Who's played that?
<RobertRevenge> I remember when Win98 was high tech.
<dr-whooves> Mah first PC ran win 98
<StinkomanFan> THIS LOOKS SHOPPED
<fluttercry> 05,15AttacktheAndalite since this was made in like 2004, it's probably XP or 2000
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<Iron_Waffle> Derpity.

<Meanwhile> That chick does look like the Run, Lola Run girl.

<robokun> ahhh, Win95, good times, good times
<OtakuTom> My first PC had Windows 3.1 and no CD-ROM drive :P
<Barbetos> Jason "Oh shiney!"
<OtakuTom> Hi everypony, BTW :P
<AttacktheAndalite> Hi OtakuTom
<ponibas> my furst pc...
<Reikim> I started out on a PC with Win 2k. It couldn't upgrade to XP because I'd get lag. I ran on that girl until late 2011.
<Kandarihu> In fact, I got to run a beta of Windows 98. One day, on the turn of the year, it just refused to boot. That's when I had to buy Win98 retail.
<ponibas> Was a... Coleco ADAM

<otakon> it hurts

<prince-dari> I've got no lag
<Reikim> Bronysith: Actually no. They got around the Regeneration issue recently.
<Sumica> 00,10you would think with the balls to jump out a window he could at least not flip fail over the railing.
<Barbetos> I think he just lagged and went of the ledge by accident.
<prince-dari> So if you do, it's probably your internet
<Reikim> That's at the end of...series 6 I think? So I won't spoil.

<Flare_Dancer> The sniper's a spy!
<Kandarihu> Well, my computer in an awkward place that it normally isn't.
<Shizuka> 13hopefully they pick the login server back up

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01[22:26:04]	Obsidian	Nittany_Discord: You are the element of organized chaos <- I'd say.
<Meanwhile> But then I need to shape up at the game and actually sort the online.

<Kandarihu> I guess, normally there's a rather clingy kitty cat to my right.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: makes sense

<Flare_Dancer> owloysius: trains?
<Darf14> bad idea to go out there
<rockytoppie85> Flare_Dancer: Soda*

<otakon> dat steam sale
<SirGanjalf> Duck Hunt
<DJPON3> like a sir
<Xaiden> Ok, he's fired two shots, hasn't reloaded
<lunac1> Flare_Dancer Nothing wrong with trains

<Darf14> Great, that duck hunt dog is now laughing at me
<Bronysith> it is so true
<Sumica> 00,10reload off camera
<RobertRevenge> Meanwhile: Not really, graphics capability was greatly improved. It actually competes with PS handhelds now.
<Flare_Dancer> No, nothing wrong with trains, but how did he draw that connection?
<Shizuka> 13t2 was fun
<Shizuka> 13played that for about six months
<Xaiden> Ok, hes reloading, some damn continuity for once
<lunac1> SirGanjalf It;s my anthrax for duck huntin
<Kandarihu> Awesome, but is it practical? That's the line between a gimmick and an upgrade
<Meanwhile> RobertRevenge: Gimmick.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02otakon: i liek gaming ^-^
<Shizuka> 13before burning out from adminning

<Obsidian> Double Tap
<SirGanjalf> ohai Clive Owen
<Sumica> 00,10that must hurt like hell
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I thought you hated T2 Shizuka?
<Dumori> I have played morrowind to death
<Shizuka> 13game of the year all years
<MASF123> What ever happened to KwakLad, MahBoi777?
<Quick_Thinker> okay so can anyone get my element correct i have my glasses to my right and what would that be rocky said its intellect but thats lazy
<ponibas> sumi, let's try it :p
<Bronysith> well i just started it
<lunac1> SuperGrony64 yeah but we don;t want to suffer Superman 64 again
<Shizuka> 13Nittany_Discord: was more burning out from managing the kids
<Dumori> well over 10,000 hours
<rockytoppie85> Mahboi I wonder whats for DINNAH
<Kandarihu> Heck. Even if it's not that awesome, if it makes things better, it's an improvement.
<Darf14> Its dangerous to go alone, here take this
<Bronysith> still figuring it out Dumori . it is very good so far
<Vordox> Nice assassin
<Shizuka> 13though i did always like eliterenegades for tribes 1 more
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Arloria hated the tribes kids.
<Xaiden> Are they gonna be friends now?
<Shizuka> 13classic was okay but they always played terrible maps
<Xaiden> That would make me laugh
<Meanwhile> Never played Morrowind. Have long since lost my big TF2 surge.
<Bronysith> i have been spoiled by quick travel and the whole arrow to where you gotta go
<Shizuka> 13bookend line there
<Flare_Dancer> Defeat = Friendship
<Obsidian> Not for long
<rockytoppie85> Its dangerous to go alone take this! -----:P
<SirGanjalf> We should watch "Children of Men" once
<rockytoppie85> brb
<otakon> yeah he's dead
<MahBoi777> MASF123: KwakLad? I haven't seen him in forever
<Flare_Dancer> He's dead Jim.
<Meanwhile> Gave Tribes 2 a whirl, thought it was neat but then I started getting horrible latency and became useless.
<Xaiden> Or hes dead\
<Modeabel> ded
<otakon> kind of feel sorry for him though
<lunac1> Friendship is the brief moment before your mortal enemy dies
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01book hates bronies because of two evangelical bronies at his job.
<Obsidian> aaaaaaaaaaand dead
<Xaiden> Wow.... that's legit
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01According to him.
<Vordox> otakon: Richpeople make good guys do bad stuff to become bad
<otakon> okay that was kind of sad
<ponibas> inb4 hurry the bloody hell up
<Quick_Thinker> thought car went boom?
<Bronysith> wow
<Xaiden> Here... I'm fine.... Ded
<otakon> not car
<Bronysith> alot of people on my friends list are playing half life 2
<ponibas> stop startin
<Shizuka> 13oh wow
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: gas tank for natural gas for house heat.
<Quick_Thinker> ah
<Flare_Dancer> ...
<Obsidian> it wont stop startin
<Shizuka> 13Meanwhile: fun fact, i once introduced a friend to tribes 1, he started sniping... from dialup
<MASF123> MahBoi777, he was the 1st person ever to greet me in Bronystate...
<Flare_Dancer> There are so many things wrong with the way a real Black Ops soldier would work in this movie...
<Shizuka> 13like 700 ping
<lunac1> otakon unfortunately for most of us house heat is the only kind we'll know
<Shizuka> 13and he was getting so many kills
<otakon> lunac1: lol
<otakon> also, I'm done downloading Magicka yay!
<rockytoppie85> back
<otakon> it was a cheapie
<rockytoppie85> Magicka?
<Meanwhile> Hax.
<lunac1> And now for something completley different
<rockytoppie85> whats Magicka?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Anticipated lag?
<Dumori> X3
<MahBoi777> MASF123: it sure has been awhile since he's been on, or maybe he changed his name >.>
<owloysius> it's a game
<lunac1> Magic spelt poorly
<Bronysith> the doctor started the 2012 olympics
<Meanwhile> I couldn't even snipe on Tribes 2 with working ping.
<rockytoppie85> is it fun?
<Bronysith> PLEASE LET TENNANT DO IT
<cratorkid> yes
<Dumori> I love forgiving netcode :P
<owloysius> with wizards, fighting an evil guy
<rockytoppie85> okay.... OHHHH
<Xaiden> Pokis dokis a phone
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't even try sniping.
<owloysius> think it's a parody of others of the genre
<Shizuka> 13iirc you had to lead targets so him having so much lag was probably making things easier
<lunac1> AT4W Because poor literacy is kewl
<rockytoppie85> WIZARDS AWESOME :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I suck at aiming.
<owloysius> there isn't really an inventory
<rockytoppie85> brb :3
<Shizuka> 13not like source where it's compensated clientside
<Vordox> Scheiße
<ponibas> who is this?
<Shizuka> 13was like a very fast projectile, not hitscan
<lunac1> Bourne Hi are we stil on for saturdauy night?
<lunac1> lol
<Shizuka> 13code in e?
<ponibas> code in RoR!~~
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Code Ni?
<Shizuka> 13nopony saw it
<Meanwhile> I get class mood. Can't play anything else if I want to play something specific.
<SirGanjalf> "I don'tknow who you are. But i will find you, and i will kill you."
<Quick_Thinker> seriously no pony can get my element figured out?
<StinkomanFan> "He's ONTO US!"
<cratorkid> knowledge
<rockytoppie85> Magika is not what i expected. I will check on it later
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just play whatever I think works.
<Shizuka> 13DED
<SirGanjalf> SHE DED
<Shizuka> 13pyro exclusive .-.
<Modeabel> ded
<ponibas> i killed her yo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I'll play more classes against bots.
<rockytoppie85> ded.
<Darf14> dead
<lunac1> shit thats cold
<SirGanjalf> d-e-d, DED
<Kandarihu> rockytoppie85, it's this video game where you're in a party of up to four wizards (all of them player controlled) fighting monsters along the way. But you can pretty much kill each other too. It's less co-op and more troll-op
<Ponies47> I'm back went away for a bit :P
<Meanwhile> On TF2 I try and go for the class no one else is playing as. Or if the scenario'd be useless, the most unused class.
<rockytoppie85> lol.
<Bronysith> i love my sniper and scout
<Kandarihu> Is Magicka 75% off again?
<owloysius> yes
<owloysius> maybe
<Quick_Thinker> apparently and i have no money
<rockytoppie85> Did he say to tell somone she was a..... fat pickle?
<ponibas> check yes or no?
<Shizuka> 13i like being able to zip around mostly cause i get tired of walking all the way back to the front after one of my extremely frequent deaths
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01More likely to play sniper against bots than against humans.
<Shizuka> 13but scout is too fast
<Shizuka> 13go figure
<rockytoppie85> ...
<lunac1> Simple wait of the meet then sniper the prick to death
<Petrified_Discord> OOOOH! You need some aloe for that BURN?
<owloysius> no
<Shizuka> 13yeah bots are good sniping targets cause they don't worry about you, good practice
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Against humans, I'll play heavy or demo.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Something easy for me.
<Petrified_Discord> owloysius: Not you :/
<Kandarihu> My laptop's on battery right now, so I closed out of Steam just to be safe.
<Barbetos> If you want to talk him to death you just have to read some Vogon poetry.
<Dumori> Fun facct source's net code can make perjectives bend in flight to get hits if you laggy
<Meanwhile> Yeah you have to either roll with scout at the start of the round because swapping to him makes you flail at the sudden boost.
<owloysius> not you either

<Barbetos> lunac1 the best america gets is sparkling vampires.
<Barbetos> =D
<ponibas> eww
<Shizuka> 13could be worse... could be shizupyro running up to you, setting you on fire, and taking like six smacks at you with the ax cause you have too much health to die the first time
<Darf14> very convincing ear pieces
<Vordox> So many agents and police
<otakon> rockytoppie85: have you tried Chronicles of Narnia or The Hobbit?
<lunac1> Barbetos agreed apart form Star Trek Vanguard
<ponibas> lamp posts shine.. not vampires
<Sumica> 00,10press X to Jason.....Bourne
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You have a flame axe.
<Bronysith> Shizuka: sharpen the axe sometime
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't have that.
<Meanwhile> going to be honest here shizu, you are the scariest pyro I have ever met on that game.
<lunac1> Twilight= Vampiric pixies
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I do have a flare gun.
<StinkomanFan> JASON
<rockytoppie85> Original narnia? yes. I have ADHD i couldnt get through it. The Hobbit? yes. same.
<Shizuka> 13i have a really really easy counter.... ping...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like pyro for hit and run.
<ponibas> lolbuhbye!
<Bronysith> i...dont care for pyro
<Shizuka> 13if my ping is above like 100 i can't do anything, airblasts don't go off when i need them too
<rockytoppie85> I have ADHD its hard to read book like that without getting bored.
<Bronysith> it seems everyone can kill me with it, yet i cant lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fire, then switch to shotgun to finish them off.
<Meanwhile> I've been playing TF2 for years and usually, pyros are no trouble at all, they mistime, they aren't looking, or they aren't aiming right. But you are absolute hellspawn.
<rockytoppie85> ..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or try and light them with the flare gun.
<Quick_Thinker> eh just do what i do imagine it happen in your room it make all the more fun
<rockytoppie85> Whats with the low amount of comments?
<Sumica> 00,10takes only 5 min if you got a can of gassoline
<lunac1> Oh he looks soo normal
<Quick_Thinker> like i imagine the harry vs voldemort battle was in my room and it was pretty damn cool
<Vinco> Sumica: But that's not what nerds do
<MASF123> MahBoi777, if that were the case, he would have greeted us and told us he changed his name. :/
<Dumori> proros are fun
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Heavy is just easy. Pick the right minigun and get in.
<Meanwhile> The most fun I ever have as pyro is on dodgeball maps.
<lunac1> Sumica your using ocmmon sense
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hope there are no spys or snipers to ruin my day.
<Kandarihu> Bookwise, you're better than me. I've been a visual guy all my life. And my experiences with books are rarely pleasant.
<lunac1> bad Sumica
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Use a sandvich if there are no medics.
<Meanwhile> There will always be a spy or a sniper ready to ruin your day.
<Meanwhile> Everywhere.
<MahBoi777> MASF123: true true, I'm not sure what happened to him:S
<Vordox> trolling?
<Darf14> smells like a trap
<Quick_Thinker> Vinco nerd is not a person its a thing some fool made up
<Bronysith> Or Wrek
<AttacktheAndalite> Dem car alarms
<StinkomanFan> BWEEEWOOP
<Jspang1> is this the first one
<StinkomanFan> BWEEEWOOP
<Meanwhile> Like I said.
<MASF123> MahBoi777, did he...did he...leave the herd? :O
<Bronysith> i know
<rockytoppie85> I am a twilight sparkle with books when i want to be. But my rainbowdash ADHD takes over. Then sometimes i want to work on my AJ garden before my dogs ate it.
<Darf14> HAX!
<fluttercry> 05,15I hate having sensitive teeth. it takes all the fun out of ice cream
<Bronysith> he headshots me everytime, even as a spaztastic scout
<rockytoppie85> lol :3
<Shizuka> 13fluttercry: ikr :<
<MahBoi777> MASF123: hopefully not
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek makes it look easy.
<rockytoppie85> lol ikr
<ponibas> ............
<Jspang1> THANK GOD THE POWER WENT OUT
<lunac1> Learn your lesson and just play Bourn;es game idiots
<ponibas> now i want ice cream..
<Meanwhile> But frankly, I can duel Wrek with sniper pretty well if I'm in a sniping mood.
<Vinco> Quick_Thinker: I guess so. They are also delicious candy.
<otakon> yes it's Bourne
<otakon> you're as good as dead
<lunac1> ponibas that was nonsequitor
<RX-78-SweetieBot> "spaztastic"
<Jspang1> this is the first one right?
<rockytoppie85> Now i want icecream. brb.
<Shizuka> 13snipers get serious ping advantage in source
<MASF123> MahBoi777, he come around some day. :$
<lunac1> he came around... euuu
<lunac1> lol
<Jspang1> i love this right here
<Shizuka> 13if the client says "i hit that guy" server is all "yup you hit that guy, HEY GUY YOU ARE DEAD"
<Jspang1> so smart
<SirGanjalf> move=dead
<Jspang1> o wait i thought this was something else
<Sumica> 00,10you raf you ruse
<Quick_Thinker> i dont ever think RD was thought to have ADHD she just gets bored easily like me so i use my imgaination to spice life up and damn is it fun
<MahBoi777> MASF123: *shrugs*
<JESmith71> And everyone leaves the stream to go out for ice cream
<SirGanjalf> Hey, he moved!
<Kandarihu> Did the dogs get sick?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Client doesn't wait to see if the guy was really there?
<Vordox> LAWL
<Quick_Thinker> bucking chat crashed
<Vordox> PROPERTY!?
<Shizuka> 13from the client's point of view the guy was
<Jspang1> but i have amnesia
*Nittany_Discord 11,01is a weapon
<Darf14> so...... hes a robot
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm a dusting weapon
*Jspang1 is property
<rockytoppie85> bnvhbhcftgffgvgfxcfc
<Shizuka> 13hitscan is all clientside
<Shizuka> 13projectiles and flames are serverside
<Pudge> hmm
<Quick_Thinker> BULLSHIT
<Jspang1> UNACCEPTABLE
<Meanwhile> The number of times you look at the killcam and the bullet mark is on the other snipers face...
<Jspang1> shoot him jason
<Kandarihu> How could he remember if he doesn't exist?
<Modeabel> Wambo
<Quick_Thinker> PARDOX
<Shizuka> 13since they take multiple ticks to move, but hitscan is a single tick, and with VAC in play, servers can trust a client when it says where a hitscan landed
<Quick_Thinker> a boat number 13?
<Darf14> 6_9
<Jspang1> Kandarihu: nobody likes a literalist
<rockytoppie85> eating icecream bar now.
<ponibas> . geeee. or maybe I just have had a craving for ice cream for a long time and don't get it for myself..
<StinkomanFan> Aw....
*AttacktheAndalite ran out of ice cream earlier today.
*MASF123 early waits for Legends of Equestria to come out
<rockytoppie85> aww so sad...
<Dumori> yup
<Shizuka> 13don't kill eddie murphy!
<rockytoppie85> DONT!
<Dumori> hitscan gets fun
<Shizuka> 13wait what am i saying SHOOT SHOOT
<Jspang1> a government agent with a heart? what is this?
*Rain hugs Shizuka
<Meanwhile> But then he had feelings?
<ponibas> double tap!
<rockytoppie85> DONT KILL him!
<Meanwhile> Whyyyyy.
<Shizuka> 13rain rain~<3
<Dumori> best yet with barndoor hitscan weapons
<lunac1> American affected by humanity RARE
*Shizuka 13pounces rain rain <3
<rockytoppie85> DONT!

<Obsidian> too many human shields
<Dumori> they just get weird

<Jspang1> lunac1: hey now
<Kandarihu> Jspang1, sorry, but I'm kind of like that.
<rockytoppie85> Wt-
<Shizuka> 13<3
*otakon hugs Rain "How are you?"
<Rain> <3
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Rain
<Dumori> you can get noregs for no reason ie client and sever side it hits but it doesn't
<Jspang1> Kandarihu: its ok i was kidding ;)
<CriticKitten> And the bullet gave him amnesia, obviously
<Quick_Thinker> huh now to spice this up with my imagination i would add dragons :D
<Rain> Im.. ok I guess, otakon
<Shizuka> 13yup
<lunac1> finally he catches on to the fact Bourne has memory loss
<CriticKitten> Damn amnesia-riddled bullets
*Rain hugs Nittany_Discord
<Kandarihu> Okay
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Barndoor hitscan? Like shotguns?
<rockytoppie85> Kill dat boi!
<Shizuka> 13it's why pyro gets stupid hard at higher ping, flames are particles and are done serverside
<Vordox> SHIT
<Quick_Thinker> hes wired
<otakon> Rain: that seems a bit off but I'll take it at face value. I could be better though, got stung by a wasp(again) and the pool kept draining on me.
<rockytoppie85> oh no D:
<Shizuka> 13so you end up lagging behind your own flame
<SirGanjalf> Spy sapped my secret agent!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
*MASF123 waves goodbye
<Jspang1> CriticKitten: because people get amnesia from bullet wounds in the back, just like you apply aloe vera on the back if you get shot in the foot
<otakon> ouchie
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Set yourself on fire?
<Quick_Thinker> very secure door
*MASF123 leaves
<Tovler> owls?
<lunac1> It;s Murrie I betyou
<otakon> bye MASF123!
<Shizuka> 13happened when phase ran a server, all the lag compensation gets more obvious the worse your ping is
<lunac1> nope
<Obsidian> Bye MASF123
<StinkomanFan> inb4 Saw trap
<Quick_Thinker> and ded
<Shizuka> 13melees can still hit but only if you've got the guy pinned
<SirGanjalf> inb4 HOLY SHIT kill
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03INCEPT- oh wait it's Bourne :/
<Shizuka> 13since melees are extremely short lived bullets
<Vinco> Pinkie trigger pull
<Jspang1> why does he hold it like that?
<rockytoppie85> why you hold it upside down-
<lunac1> shooting while holding the gun upside down
<Vordox> WHOA dat Arab is good :P
<otakon> hiya Scoot-Scootaloo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Melee is funny in TF2.
<otakon> damn, tough Arab
<Jspang1> lunac1: like a boss
<Vordox> THAT GUY IS BAD
<OtakuTom> Ah...so THAT'S where Death The Kid learned to hold his guns upside-down :P
<otakon> OUCHIE
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Because he is an MLG LEGITT
<AttacktheAndalite> Oh yeah, I might or might not be on tomorrow~
<AttacktheAndalite> hai Scoot-Scootaloo
<otakon> well he's dead now
<Shizuka> 13but airblast and detonator and flames are all projectiles so i would click and like half a second later it would remember to puff
<Meanwhile> Demopan.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't really like to melee because it's funny.
<otakon> AttacktheAndalite: well that sucks
<Shizuka> 13by then the guy ran away
<lunac1> Is that a combine?

<otakon> woah
<Quick_Thinker> and the universe is calling bullshit
<CriticKitten> WUT
<Jspang1> thats right run up the stairs to an enemy who has the drop on you... literally
<Sumica> 00,10I am calling zomby bulshit
<cratorkid> that ragdoll
<Petrified_Discord> That is some amazingly awesome bullshit
<otakon> LOL
<Shizuka> 13so that happened
<lunac1> Another Hollywood staple cartoon physics
<Meanwhile> Yeah, flame aim is tragic when it misses at near point blank range.
<otakon> Sumica: MYTHBUSTERS!
<Shizuka> 13obviously he's jason buddha mode
<Rain> that sucks, otakon
<Vordox> lawl Jspang1
<rockytoppie85> Lol.
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon: Internet's getting cut off either tomorrow or day after. I hope it's the day after and if I can come up with 50 bucks, we can get it cut back on till we can pay the late fee
<otakon> Rain: yh your telling me.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not sure of the "range" of melee weapons in TF2.
<Obsidian> Gota love movie phisics
<Meanwhile> Ohey Rain.
<Petrified_Discord> "I'm awake! I'm awake! What happened?"
<Jspang1> what physics?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Like if it's a foot out or if you have to be right next to them for them to hit.
<lunac1> Staircase later used used in Blade:The Series
<Shizuka> 13it's about what you would expect iirc, the range of your weapon outstretched or so
<AttacktheAndalite> Ohai Rain
<rockytoppie85> and thats how that guy got amnesia. again.
<StinkomanFan> ((FFFFFFFF- chat broke, gimme a second))
<Vordox> shtte...
<Shizuka> 13but best results are when you're right there obviously
<otakon> AttacktheAndalite: damn that really sucks man, try your public library or a Denny's with a labtop then if you don't want to miss the movie stream tomorrow. Good luck with that.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> The range of melee weapons is melee range :3
<Shizuka> 13since it's really bullets
<Meanwhile> Yeah until you take a magic 12 foot fist to the spine.
<otakon> welp, he's dead.
<lunac1> So creepy french is left PLEASE KILL HIUM
<Jspang1> i never got wy this guy died, why did he have him killed?
<Vordox> NO
<Shizuka> 13spies is where it gets dumb cause a facestab is all lag compensation
<Vordox> NOT MARK WAHLENBERG
<Vordox> NO
<SirGanjalf> team killer!
<Vordox> NOOOOOOOOOOOO
<otakon> Jspang1: to cover it up
<rockytoppie85> what is the difference between all the channels? like pinkiepie, rainbowdash, etc,
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon: I'm gonna miss the movie stream anyways because I have school tomorrow night. But my school has Wi-Fi
<otakon> YOU TEAMKILLING COCKBITE!

<otakon> AttacktheAndalite: night school?
<Dumori> you've always had long X
<Jspang1> otakon: its fucktard... get the reference right
<Shizuka> 13that and the spy's backstab range is like a full 180 degrees on your back
<Vinco> He's dead, Jim!
<lunac1> So the higher up actually cleaned up the mess. lol
<CriticKitten> Stryker is best evil boss
<Darf14> Dang team killer
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon: Unfortunately, I can't connect to #bronystate on mIRC because...school Internet. But I can get on PonyChat
<otakon> Jspang1: no it's cockbite
<Dumori> I rember dystopia with ping
<JESmith71> Rockytoppie during the episode streams there are so many users they open up the other rooms because of all the users here
<Big_Macintosh_1992> rockytoppie85: it only makes a difference when there's a big event. it's not split right now. At least that's how I understand it
<Barbetos> Turning off the lights and monitors is how you get rid of computer right!?
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon: Yep. 6pm to 10:30pm
<Dumori> you could get lagkilled by closing doors
<StinkomanFan> NINE MINUTES
<otakon> Jspang1: you get it right, cockbite=roosterteeth
<Dumori> run though door it closes after your you die
<Vordox> ...............
