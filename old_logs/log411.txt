<Skylands> 10k then
<drfsupercenter> 03> that's funny you say that
<drfsupercenter> 03> I actually just bought the dub DVDs of that show
<Skylands> 10I WAS TOO DISTRACTED THINKING ABOUT PUELLA MAGI, FORGIVE ME
<Skylands> 10:P
<NightSeas> 1212XD
<nickstr> I just got a new battery for my own laptop today
<nickstr> now it will not die in less than 10 minutes
<NightSeas> 1212like the 3DS?
*NightSeas runs
<Meanwhile> Eenope.
<nickstr> yea
<nickstr> then again I tried that too in Walmart
<NightSeas> 1212For that reason I had to buy a car charger for my 3DS
<nickstr> by cranking the 3D slider only half way up I did not get a headache!
<RX-78-2-SweetieBot> Shouldnt you be doing something with TGaPT?
<nickstr> nor disorientation
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wut ?
<NightSeas> 1212nice
<NightSeas> 1212I got used to it so now I almost always have it on full blast :x
<RX-78-2-SweetieBot> The Great and Powerful Trixie of course
*Meanwhile bonks RX-78-2-SweetieBot upside the head.
<RX-78-2-SweetieBot> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03nickstr, you need to try it for more than like 10 minutes LOL
<nickstr> I did at one point
<nickstr> I got dizzy and disoriented
<NightSeas> 1212ah
<nickstr> but then again this was with the 3D slider cranked all the way up
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, I have to have the 3D *off*
<nickstr> halfway to about three quarters of the way up is fine
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's basically a waste of a console
<Angel_Umbreon> 13Aren't you supposed to use the slider so that you can let your eyes slowly adjust to it over time anyway?
<NightSeas> 1212drf, the 3DS isn't only about 3D :P
<NightSeas> 1212and yeah AE
<nickstr> don't know and to be honest don't care
<NightSeas> 1212that would be like saying the wii is only about that remote derp
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean it's not?
<NightSeas> 1212drf
<NightSeas> 1212http://images.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/10576698.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03the Wii is essentially a GameCube with wireless remotes...
<NightSeas> 1212XD
<nickstr> sure seems that way
<NightSeas> 1212well, everything Nintendo makes is really about the content
<nickstr> not really
<nickstr> more about the gimmicks
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<NightSeas> 1212That’s an opinion
<NightSeas> 1212:P
<nickstr> its not an opinion
<nickstr> its the truth
<nickstr> they have been all about gimmicks since the release of the DS
<NightSeas> 12[16:42] <NightSeas> well, everything Nintendo makes is really about the content
<NightSeas> 12[16:42] <nickstr> not really
<NightSeas> 12So you’re saying they have all that exclusive content like Zelda and Mario for no reason?
<drfsupercenter> 03what nickstr said
<nickstr> pretty much
<drfsupercenter> 03Since the release of the DS
<drfsupercenter> 03Originally they were good
<drfsupercenter> 03but since maybe 2007
<drfsupercenter> 03they've kinda sucked
<nickstr> Sony and Microsoft have exclusive stuff too
<NightSeas> 1212people don't really buy those just for the content though
<junh1024-XD> where r LL
<nickstr> mostly because the systems are true innovation
<NightSeas> 1212Nintendo would go under if they didn't have good content.
<drfsupercenter> 03junh1024-XD she's at work
<drfsupercenter> 03why
<NightSeas> 12That's the ONLY reason anyone bothers playing Nintendo's stuff
<nickstr> because their systems suck
<drfsupercenter> 03<NightSeas> people don't really buy those just for the content though <- ahem, Halo
<nickstr> the Wii was outdated as soon as it was released
<nickstr> same with the
<nickstr> Gameboy Color
<NightSeas> 1212drf, Halo doesn't have as many fans as say Mario Pokemon and Zelda
<drfsupercenter> 03orly?
<drfsupercenter> 03go join some Halo 3 matches on Xbox Live, I dare you
*drfsupercenter hides
<Drake> 04lolhalo3
<Drake> 04Play Reach n00bs
*Drake runs
<drfsupercenter> 03same idea.
<nickstr> in the time it took Nintendo to come out with a full color portable they had already been beaten by Atari, Sega, and NEC
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL NEC
<UnFoundBug> poor meanwhile, soon he will truly embrace his feelings
<Meanwhile> Shaddup you.
<nickstr> in their case its true
<nickstr> NEC came out with the Turbo Express aka the PC Engine Game Tank
<NightSeas> 1212see, Nintendo has same of the best selling franchises of all time.
<NightSeas> 12Mario has sold more than 220 million units before, and Pokmon 210 million
<drfsupercenter> 03key word on franchise
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm pretty certain that Halo 2 holds the record for fastest selling out of a game
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03or most preorders, something like that
<drfsupercenter> 03I know Pokémon Yellow has a similar record but yeah
<NightSeas> 1212no, Pokemon Black and White had the most pre-orders
<drfsupercenter> 03NightSeas, maybe of Nintendo games
<NightSeas> 1212nope, all games
<drfsupercenter> 03according to who
<NightSeas> 1212just google "black white preorders" :P
<drfsupercenter> 03oh it was Halo 3
<drfsupercenter> 03GameSpot reported 4.2 million units of Halo 3 were in retail outlets on September 24, 2007, a day before official releasea world record volume.[142][143] Halo 3 broke the previous record for the highest grossing opening day in entertainment history, making US$170 million in its first twenty-four hours.

<NightSeas> 1212that's 2007 drf LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03dude that's only comparing to other games released around the same time
<drfsupercenter> 03not every game ever made
<drfsupercenter> 03learn to do better research
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm referring to the Guinness Book of World Records so don't question me
<NightSeas> 1212Guinness Book of World Records from 2007? derp
*NightSeas runs
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<drfsupercenter> 03from like 2010 or something
<drfsupercenter> 03I can check the newest one
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm lazy
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't think ti was preorders, I think it was opening day sales

<NightSeas> 1212there
<drfsupercenter> 03hey look, #1 isn't BW, your argument is invalid
*drfsupercenter runs
<NightSeas> 1212derp
<NightSeas> 1212I said it had the most pre-orders, not sales XD
<drfsupercenter> 03and I said you're an idiot
<drfsupercenter> 03problem?
<NightSeas> 1212but as you can see, most of the top games on that page are Nintendo
<drfsupercenter> 03read the bottom
<drfsupercenter> 03Just like PG-13 movies inherently make more money than R-rated moviesbecause they are accessible to a much wider audiencegames that appeal to a wide age range always outsell even the most successful mature titles. Thus, until Master Chief starts tangling with Pikachu, Halo 3 will carry much more marketing heft than it does sales clout.
<NightSeas> 1212It’s the only reason Nintendo still exist
<NightSeas> 1212well, I never said why those get so many sales derp

<NightSeas> 1212the 3DS did for a few weeks (Compared to portables) , but that was very short lived
<drfsupercenter> 03Not...really

<NightSeas> 1212PSP has a better resolution
<drfsupercenter> 03Nintendo has always made crap-horrible hardware and then programmed accordingly, making the best of their hardware
<drfsupercenter> 03hence the whole "Genesis does what Nintendon't" thing
<drfsupercenter> 03it was true, too
<drfsupercenter> 03GameCube supposedly had better graphics than PS2, but did they actually use it? Nope.
<drfsupercenter> 03Wii is essentially GameCube hardware with wireless, so...
<NightSeas> 1212and widescreen
<NightSeas> 1212Native widescreen
<drfsupercenter> 03there's no such thing as native widescreen
<NightSeas> 1212they were both 480p

<NightSeas> 12someone's not going to kill someone because they were playing a game

<RX-78-2-SweetieBot> we seem to have retained a lot from this past weekend for some reason

<HyperMetalLugia> OLd Man DRF and his M rated games
<UnFoundBug> rather, which is wierd considering there wasnt an episode
<NightSeas> 12I dislike almost all M games
<drfsupercenter> 03I honestly think most T-rated games are more fun, just because the M-rated ones tend to be solely BASED ON blood and gore and not actual storyline
<drfsupercenter> 03stuff like Left 4 Dead is fun until you overplay it
<drfsupercenter> 03and get tired of it
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<NightSeas> 12T games tend to be my favs
<RX-78-2-SweetieBot> That might kinda of be why, they showed up for the episode, but since there wasnt a new one, they stayed a bit and liked the weirdness of the streams or something

<drfsupercenter> 03Subscription to LIVING THINGS REMIXED. You will receive one new remix per month for the next 8 months.
<Kosoveon> enough for me
<drfsupercenter> 03Remixes? OK
<drfsupercenter> 03Though ew paying $16 for a DIGITAL DOWNLOAD
<drfsupercenter> 03the actual disc is $10
<drfsupercenter> 03*20
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd do that, but I don't know what my address will be in June :/
<Hogia> 02tLoS killed Spyro
<Hogia> 02but not as badly as Skylanders
*Hogia shudders
<HyperMetalLugia> ohno
<drfsupercenter> 03Skylanders is a retarded concept.
<Aurora> 6I loved TLoS lol...
<drfsupercenter> 03Ironically, LL actually thought it was a good idea
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like "u srs?"
<Aurora> 6skylanders /seems/ cool
<drfsupercenter> 03>Making you buy cheap plastic figurines to play a game
<drfsupercenter> 03>no thank you
<Hogia> 02yeah
<Aurora> 6until you realize it's more spending money than pokemon cards were
<drfsupercenter> 03it's what most people call "physical DRM"
<Hogia> 02and Spyro LOOKS LIKE A FREAKING PUG
<drfsupercenter> 03As if REGULAR DRM is bad enough
<Aurora> 6yeah I wasn't happy with the art team for that game
<drfsupercenter> 03OK I don't know who the frick Spyro is and what the fuss is, I'm commenting on the fact that you have to buy stupid figurines to play the game
<Hogia> 02BREATHING PROBLEMS ANYONE
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't actually play most game series, I just follow the stupid copy protection methods companies are using
<drfsupercenter> 03it's part of WHY I Don't play most games :P
<Hogia> 02The original PS1 Spyro games were the best
<drfsupercenter> 03though I did laugh quite a bit when Ubisoft ragequit the PC gaming industry
<Hogia> 02they did?
<drfsupercenter> 03"Fine, you guys keep complaining about our DRM? Instead of doing the sensible thing and FIXING it, we're just going to stop"
<drfsupercenter> 03Yep.
<drfsupercenter> 03they made some press statement about how PC gaming is "too much of a hassle" and how they were only going to deal with consoles from now on
<Hogia> 02so no more Assassin's Creed games on the PC?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's because the entire world basically HATED their DRM
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently not.
<Hogia> 02D:
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't follow their stuff, again, I just know about the stupid crap they pull
<HyperMetalLugia> Not a loss
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<Hogia> 02I prefer PC controls
<drfsupercenter> 03when I play games on the PC, I use a wired Xbox 360 controller. LOL
<Kosoveon> <Aurora> yeah I wasn't happy with the art team for that game<---I'm not a Spyro fan, but yes, my god yes
<Kosoveon> I'm not really that judgemental in terms of art design but I HATED skylanders
<drfsupercenter> 03am I the only one who hates the game because it requires you to buy collectible stuff in order to play it, having nothing to do with the art or lack thereof?
<Hogia> 02I finished Portal 2 on the PC, then months later I played co-op briefly on the Xbox
<Hogia> 02the controls were too sensitive
<Drake> 04>Spyro Skylands
<Kosoveon> if the game was good I wouldn't care, but I don't plan on playing it anytime soon
<drfsupercenter> 03I played the Portal 2 co-op on the PC and then the single-player on Xbox 360 and later played the co-op again with LL on Xbox 360
<Drake> 04At least it unifies TLoS/Old Gen fans
<Drake> 04Skylanders*
<Drake> 04GODDAMNIT
<Kosoveon> so for all I know it might be, but that art design .___.
<drfsupercenter> 03has anybody pirated it yet? :D
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 make your own figurines
<Hogia> 02I don't plan to play Skylanders EVER
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<Hogia> 02heh
<HyperMetalLugia> Never
<HyperMetalLugia> Ever
<drfsupercenter> 03I've never played a single Spyro game
<drfsupercenter> 03and have no idea what the fuss is about
<drfsupercenter> 03but again
<drfsupercenter> 03>PHYSICAL DRM
*drfsupercenter vomits
<HyperMetalLugia> Sticking with the PS1 games and/or a random PS2 one
<Kosoveon> BRICK DRAGON! ACTIVATE!
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<Kosoveon> :D
<SheenaFox> I have hunger.
<drfsupercenter> 03really, *any* DRM is awful
<SheenaFox> brb
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 people misspelling my initials for DRM >_>
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF, the worst DRM
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL.
<HyperMetalLugia> Is when you gotta have a disk in the drive
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03the only acceptable DRM is that which can be easily removed
<Hogia> 02I've got tLoS tEN on my DS and I hate it
<drfsupercenter> 03like iTunes
<drfsupercenter> 03I can just strip the DRM right off
<HyperMetalLugia> "Please insert the disk into the drive so you can play"
<drfsupercenter> 03as long as the Requiem project doesn't die off
<Hogia> 02because I can't beat Terrador
<HyperMetalLugia> But, I'm on a laptop
<drfsupercenter> 03HML
<Hogia> 02CURSE YOU EARTH ELDER DRAGON
<drfsupercenter> 03you ever played the original Backyard Baseball?
<drfsupercenter> 03That thing was the most legit game ever
<HyperMetalLugia> Nope
<drfsupercenter> 03No isntalling
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<drfsupercenter> 03You just pop the CD in
<drfsupercenter> 03and it starts
<drfsupercenter> 03:D
<Hogia> 02sounds good
<Hogia> 02but
<Hogia> 02baseball?
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate most sports games, but that game was awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03it's actually really fun
<drfsupercenter> 03trust me XD
<Hogia> 02O.o
<drfsupercenter> 03there's a backyard soccer too but I hated that
<Hogia> 02o...k?
<drfsupercenter> 03mainly because soccer is too chaotic
<Hogia> 02eh
<drfsupercenter> 03baseball, at least you're only playing one person at a time
<drfsupercenter> 03at least when you're at bat
<drfsupercenter> 03and not trying to control an entire team
<Hogia> 02I like soccer irl
<drfsupercenter> 03they later made like, a Backyard Basketball and some other spinoffs
<drfsupercenter> 03but the original was the best by far
<Hogia> 02but sports games on consoles? forget it.
<drfsupercenter> 03There's a Backyard Baseball 2003, I didn't like it
<drfsupercenter> 03Hogia, PC.
<drfsupercenter> 03not console
<Hogia> 02k
<drfsupercenter> 03Backyard Baseball is a series of children's games for the Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Wii, iOS, and the PC. It is the original game in the Backyard Sports series. Currently all the games in the series have been developed by Humongous Entertainment and published by Atari. It is one of six Backyard Sports games.
<drfsupercenter> 03really?
<drfsupercenter> 03GBA, PS2, even iOS?
<Hogia> 02Is there an appropriate umbrella term I can use?
<drfsupercenter> 03Pssh, I only have it for PC
<drfsupercenter> 03http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backyard_Baseball
<drfsupercenter> 03the 1997 one is the one I'm referring to
<drfsupercenter> 03back when I had Windows 95
<drfsupercenter> 03that game was awesome
<Hogia> 02stupid thing automatically opens links in IE
<Hogia> 02I'm using Chrome, dammit
<drfsupercenter> 03it opens in whatever your default browser is.
<Hogia> 02:I
<Hogia> 02I should change that
<Hogia> 02IE sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03so HML
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually sorta want a Chromebook
<drfsupercenter> 03Just for lulz
<HyperMetalLugia> Haha
<HyperMetalLugia> Well,
<drfsupercenter> 03but they're a bit expensive for what they're worth
<HyperMetalLugia> ChromeOS/Chromium OS
<drfsupercenter> 03do they have CHrome OS as an installable ISO I can play with in a VM?
<HyperMetalLugia> Runs on a regular laptop
<HyperMetalLugia> ;D
<HyperMetalLugia> uh
<HyperMetalLugia> Bad idea
<drfsupercenter> 03why
<HyperMetalLugia> I tried the VM version
<HyperMetalLugia> and
<HyperMetalLugia> No support
<HyperMetalLugia> for anything
<drfsupercenter> 03ethernet doesn't work I'm guessing?
<HyperMetalLugia> like, mouse + drivers
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf?
<HyperMetalLugia> Not exactly
<Mikanjack> hey guys, how can i msg from irc client into #bronystate?
<drfsupercenter> 03did you use VMWare or VBox
<HyperMetalLugia> Both
<HyperMetalLugia> I think
<HyperMetalLugia> But
<HyperMetalLugia> I've ran ChromeOS natively on an old thinkpad
<HyperMetalLugia> ran fine
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL

<HyperMetalLugia> So I suppose it hates emulated mice
<drfsupercenter> 03can I run it off a flash drive?
<drfsupercenter> 03because my laptop currently has no hard drive
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<HyperMetalLugia> yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> I did that actually
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03where do you download it? :P
<Phase4> Mikanjack, http://ponychat.net/server-information/
<HyperMetalLugia> What happened to your laptop though?
<drfsupercenter> 03hard drive broke
<HyperMetalLugia> and I believe you can run it natively
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why it has no hard drive
<HyperMetalLugia> again>
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<HyperMetalLugia> Ouch
<drfsupercenter> 03remembe rI said
<HyperMetalLugia> Without installing
<drfsupercenter> 037200RPM is a trap
<drfsupercenter> 03in laptops
<HyperMetalLugia> http://chromeos.hexxeh.net/
<drfsupercenter> 03because at that high of a speed, even the slightest movement can damage it
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<drfsupercenter> 037200RPM is great if you just keep your laptop stationary
<drfsupercenter> 03which I USUALLY do

<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03OK so

<Phase4> include this room meens 7 rooms, add one for the video and i get a nice 2x4 grid
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what?
<Yahooz> your call
<Phase4> though i would probably need to record higher than 1280x720 for that

<Chimera> haha
<Rukario> nom
<drfsupercenter> 03that sounds annoying Ascendant LOL>
<Ascendant> it's lulzy
<Ascendant> I know someone who does it
<Ascendant> it's like bf
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 mindf or whatever it is
<Ascendant> it's brainf
<drfsupercenter> 03that
<Ascendant> it's worse than bf though
<Ascendant> since bf has 8 operatives
<Ascendant> this only has 3
<Ascendant> so it's even closer to binary
<drfsupercenter> 03oh hey
<drfsupercenter> 03I think vSphere is FINALLY ALMOST STARTED
<Ascendant> o-o
<Ascendant> lmao
<drfsupercenter> 03it takes like
<drfsupercenter> 03hours
<Ascendant> just wait another few hours
<drfsupercenter> 03but supposedly only at first run
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03basically what I'm doing
<drfsupercenter> 03I installed Windows 7 natively (Why 7? because I'm too lazy to mess with server), + drivers, and then did the experience index benchmark
<drfsupercenter> 03then I'm gonna install 7 inside the VM
<drfsupercenter> 03give it the full CPU/RAM
<drfsupercenter> 03and benchmark again
<drfsupercenter> 03see how it compares
<drfsupercenter> 03if it's close enough
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll run it on my server
<drfsupercenter> 03and you can have Linux via that
<drfsupercenter> 03good? :P
<Ascendant> :o
<Ascendant> cool
<Ascendant> also
*Ascendant explodes a falling boulder on drf's head
*Ascendant goes off
<drfsupercenter> 03FMA was saying it might actually eat 2GB of RAM by itself
<Ascendant> doubtit
<drfsupercenter> 03which, if it does, do not frickingw ant
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03Hopefully
<drfsupercenter> 03I can get 3GB for Windows
<drfsupercenter> 03and if it takes like 512MB or so for vsphere
<drfsupercenter> 03you're fine with the rest? :P
<Ascendant> it'll probably eat like 512mb or something
<Ascendant> sure
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<Ascendant> if you can, it'd be nice to get 2 extra IPs, I'll pay for them
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah if I get it to work I can just give you the vsphere admin pasword
<Ascendant> don't think 2 IPs needs justification
<drfsupercenter> 03we'll deal with that later XD
<Ascendant> Yeah lmao
<drfsupercenter> 03since I'm gonna need the LARA console again
<drfsupercenter> 03at elast
<drfsupercenter> 03*least
<drfsupercenter> 03they left that flash drive plugged in
<Ascendant> and then i'll add your server to a botnet and then I'll be happy
<drfsupercenter> 03so I can just dump this onto that
*Ascendant hides
<drfsupercenter> 03it's only like a 400MB ISO
<Ascendant> lmao
<drfsupercenter> 03and it uses uh
<drfsupercenter> 03ISOLINUX
<drfsupercenter> 03to load
<drfsupercenter> 03so I can easily just use unetbootin
<Ascendant> they left it plugged in?
<drfsupercenter> 03yep.
<drfsupercenter> 03same with the USB floppy drive
*Ascendant facepalms
<drfsupercenter> 03that has drivers
<drfsupercenter> 03THE WRONG DRIVERS TOO MIGHT I AD
<Ascendant> >floppy
<drfsupercenter> 03*ADD
<Ascendant> what
<drfsupercenter> 03you know how Windows wasn't seeing the hard drives?
<Ascendant> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03due to the RAID controller?
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Ascendant> yeah I saw
<drfsupercenter> 03they're like
<drfsupercenter> 03"We connected them"
<Ascendant> lmao
<drfsupercenter> 03they put a USB floppy drive
<drfsupercenter> 03it had the WRONG F'ING DRIVERS
<Ascendant> FLOPPY
<drfsupercenter> 03so I had to go find them mysel
<drfsupercenter> 03f
*Ascendant snaps the floppy and flops it around
<drfsupercenter> 03then use the Linux recovery console
<drfsupercenter> 03to put them on the USB
<drfsupercenter> 03meanwhile PAYING FOR THE GOD DANG LARA CONSOLE
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm a bit mad still
<drfsupercenter> 03but whatever
<Ascendant> ._.
<drfsupercenter> 03FMA says that VSphere is based on Linux (I don't doubt it) so
<Ascendant> still, hetzner's uptime is quite awesome
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> uhh my head -_-
<Ascendant> probably is
<drfsupercenter> 03it SHOULD "just work" with the RAID controller?
<drfsupercenter> 03and not neeed drivers?
<drfsupercenter> 03-e
<Ascendant> a lot of things like that are based off linux or unix
<Ascendant> should
<Ascendant> linux generally works
<Ascendant> or doesn't
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<RX-78-2-SweetieBot> new trick backfire?
<Ascendant> other http://www.linux-drivers.org/
<Ascendant> otherwise
<drfsupercenter> 03I've had more experience with it not workin
<drfsupercenter> 03g
<Ascendant> if it doesn't have it installed already
<Ascendant> derp
<drfsupercenter> 03uh

<RX-78-2-SweetieBot> That sounds much worse
<RX-78-2-SweetieBot> you should get some juice and crackers and rest then, instead of being on a computer
<drfsupercenter> 03oh my god
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant I am an idiot
<drfsupercenter> 03I thought I'd reboot it to see if it went any faster
<drfsupercenter> 03Nope.
<drfsupercenter> 03Not at all.
<drfsupercenter> 03give me like 2 more hours to test >_>
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i did fell asleep a few hours ago, so now i can't sleep -_-
<Ascendant> ._.
<drfsupercenter> 03I guess that's the one downside to vSphere
<Ascendant> it shouldn't be taking that long to boot
<drfsupercenter> 03is stupidly long reboot times
<drfsupercenter> 03I learned that from work
<Ascendant> ah

<RX-78-2-SweetieBot> ah

<drfsupercenter> 03the whole idea to vSphere
<RX-78-2-SweetieBot> then watch some ponies :3
<drfsupercenter> 03is that you leave the physical machine running

<HyperMetalLugia> okaaayyyy
<SilverSonic> JUST BLOODY DIDDILY DANDY.
<Drake> 04And maybe we can help comfort you.
<Aurora> 6um
<Aurora> 6if a girl is causing you to be this rage-y
<Aurora> 6no offense man
<Aurora> 6but that's not healthy
<SilverSonic> i might just write a document in note pad, dropbox it and link it in here.
<HyperMetalLugia> Sure
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I swear I didn't do it
<HyperMetalLugia> Do that please
<HyperMetalLugia> :s
<SilverSonic> actually
<Drake> 04Shiny
<SilverSonic> screw posting it in here
<Drake> 04how dare you cause this
<SilverSonic> ill PM it to a select few of you.
<Drake> 04rightio
<Aurora> 6dude you need to
<HyperMetalLugia> Okay :c
<Shiny-Growlithe> 028C
<Aurora> 6relax
<Aurora> 6a bit
<Aurora> 6stress literally isn't healthy, and drives people /away/
<SilverSonic> I'm trying.
<SilverSonic> well its driven my gf away...again
<Aurora> 6what did you do?
<SilverSonic> apparently i was taking a little joke "too far". when i was clearly just playing around.
<SilverSonic> i didnt know any better.
<SilverSonic> she didnt tell me to stop.
<Aurora> 6in which case it's not your fault
<Aurora> 6well
<Aurora> 6more like both your faults
<SilverSonic> yeah.
<SilverSonic> thats how i saw it
<Aurora> 6but one thing that relationships seem to dwell on a lot is what's "offensive"
<Aurora> 6relationships, you're supposed to be best friends, so when you're mad, you're not supposed to leave and ragequit basically
<SilverSonic> and that offensive list is massive with her i think
<Aurora> 6you should be able to handle it maturely and decide what went wrong
<SilverSonic> i can barely go a day w/o being in tears.
<SilverSonic> EVEN ON THE DAY OF MY SHOWS I CANT GO W/O CRYING.
<Drake> 04"You're and @$$" may be totally acceptable, but on the other hand "I don't like those shoes" may turn her into an eldritch horror.
<SilverSonic> she throws a fit for that too.
<Aurora> 6um
<SilverSonic> ;-;
<Aurora> 6wait how old are you?
<SilverSonic> 18 why?
<SilverSonic> -.-
<junh1024-XD> `-`
<Aurora> 6just wondering
<SilverSonic> sigh.
<SilverSonic> anyway. im like
<Aurora> 6cuz you're making it sound like you're not getting anyhting positive out of the relation.
<SilverSonic> atm im not
<Aurora> 6a girl who makes you cry no matter what, yeah
<Aurora> 6I see people root themselves into relationships and they suffer for it, I don't know why they stay
<Aurora> 6so as long as you find something to hold onto
<Aurora> 6it's worth it if you deem it worthy
<Aurora> 6but you need to measure that against how miserable you are in the bad times
<Aurora> 6"partners are there to drag you out of the bad times" can only go so far.
<Drake> 04A small high isn't worth abysmal downtimes.
<Drake> 04Why am I giving relationship advice when I've never had a girlfriend
*Drake shuts up now.
<Aurora> 6lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Relationship in a friend way possibly?
<SilverSonic> well i'm not in a PROPER relationshop
<SilverSonic> ...
<SilverSonic> relationship*
<HyperMetalLugia> o-o
<Aurora> 6I wouldn't really be considered "experienced" in this, and yet people always seem to come to me for it, so I tend to be fairly good at it
<SilverSonic> I'm in a LD ne.
<SilverSonic> one*
<Aurora> 6if it's not a proper relationship
<Drake> 04Aurora, so do all my IRL friends to me.
<Drake> 04It's weird.
<Aurora> 6you really shouldn't value it so highly
<Aurora> 6unless you can see yourself marrying said person
<Aurora> 6think it through before causing more grief
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm that general advice person too.
<Drake> 04I think TST is made of general advice people.
<SilverSonic> SIGH
*Shiny-Growlithe doodles on the back of Roara's head
<Aurora> 6it's not always the best
*Drake doodles on the back of Shiny's head.
<Aurora> 6but I do advise you take a look at where you are right now
<Light_Latias> 12Shiny~
<Aurora> 6and decide what's worth it and what's not.
<Aurora> 6if you are depressed that often...
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey LL
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Sorry I can't stay and draw on anyone else's heads, but I have to sleep
<Aurora> 6night
<SilverSonic> ow my ribs are hurting alot ;_;
<Drake> 04Everything Aurora says x2 @SilverSonic
<Drake> 04Night Shiny
*Drake hugs
<SilverSonic> i know Drake.
<NightSeas> 12Nick alert
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Aurora> 6<SilverSonic>	i can barely go a day w/o being in tears. <-this in particular has me worried
*NightSeas removes Night from nick alert
<NightSeas> 12[21:43] <Drake> I think TST is made of general advice people. <-- Best thing ever said
<SilverSonic> I can't....let...her...go... ;_;
<SilverSonic> I've been with her for over a year ;_;
<Aurora> 6um
<HyperMetalLugia> .,.
<Aurora> 6that right there is the most dangerous and destructive thing I've heard a person say
<SilverSonic> i know ;_;
<SilverSonic> If i did let her go...well...she'd kill herself ;_;
<Aurora> 6are you willing to stay with a person who makes you cry on a daily basis, who clearly doesn't understand your humor, all because you'e been with her for only a year?
<Aurora> 6..
<SilverSonic> she nearly attempted it.
<Drake> 04...
<Drake> 04I have no words.
<Aurora> 6then have a psychologist when you do it
<Aurora> 6again, you are rooting yourself to something that is not your responsibility
<NightSeas> 12wait
<SilverSonic> what can i do
<NightSeas> 12what did I miss?
<SilverSonic> i dont want to ruin her trust ;_;
<Aurora> 6are you content marrying her?
<Aurora> 6or worse, having her think she'll marry you and then you say no?
<NightSeas> 12O_O
<NightSeas> 12O_o*
<Kosoveon> don't take this the wrong way, SilverSonic, but I worry if doing that (her attempting/talking about suicide) has caused you to be manipulated and put in a corner to prevent you from leaving her
<Drake> 04SilverSonic is with a girl who makes him cry on a daily basis, and he doesn't want to end it because he says she'll commit suicide.
<Aurora> 6SS, does her parents know she's semi-suicidal?
<NightSeas> 12did you meet her online or IRL?
<Kosoveon> no matter what, you should do what you think in your heart should do...in other words, what you truly feel will make you happy
<Xanbreon> bwaaaaaaa
<SilverSonic> online GL. and yes Roara.
<Aurora> 6then let them know
<SilverSonic> actually wait
<NightSeas> 12ah
<Aurora> 6if anything, talk to them first
<Aurora> 6as awkward as that sounds
<SilverSonic> i misread that as my parents
<SilverSonic> no her mom doesnt.
<SilverSonic> and she hates her mom.
<Aurora> 6dad?
<NightSeas> 12why does she make you cry?
<SilverSonic> her dad is in cali.
<SilverSonic> she lives in WA
<SilverSonic> i dont even know her dad.
<Aurora> 6ok well
<SilverSonic> GL: long story.
<Aurora> 6that makes it somewhat harder
<Aurora> 6but the fact remains that you're basically chained to a person and you don't seem to have a say in anything
<Kosoveon> ^pretty much
<Drake> 04^Seconded
<Kosoveon> if you took all the worry of what she will do out of the equation
<Aurora> 6as I've had to say to several people (believe me, the suicidal thing isn't the first time I've heard it), whatever happens to the other person IS NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
<NightSeas> 12v downed
<Kosoveon> is she really worth the effort? think about that long and hard
*NightSeas runs
<Aurora> 6I hate being this blunt, but if she were to injure herself, that's not something you should be responsible for and so you should not worry about it
<SilverSonic> sigh
<SilverSonic> this is too overwhelming atm ;-;
<Aurora> 6I mean, feel sad yes, but not because it was your fault
<Aurora> 6I'm only trying to help
<Aurora> 6because you've mentioned this trouble before
<Drake> 04:/
<NightSeas> 12and why does he want to leave her?
<SilverSonic> i dont want to leave her.
<SilverSonic> if i did she'd kill herself GL.
<SilverSonic> sigh
<NightSeas> 12then why are you upset? derp
<SilverSonic> i know you guys are trying to help and many thanks for it ;_; but im just really overwhelmed on what to do atm.
<Aurora> 6allow yourself to remain in a suffering position, or free yourself and perhaps it wont be as bad as you think
<SilverSonic> READ UP DUDE IM TIRED OF EXPLAING IT.
<Aurora> 6there's your two choices
<Drake> 04SilverSonic, take some time to calm down.
<HyperMetalLugia> o-o
*NightSeas lazy
<Kosoveon> dude...
<Drake> 04And stop yelling at people trying to help.
<Aurora> 6drake
<SilverSonic> i was yelling at GL.
<Aurora> 6that was NS's fault
<Aurora> 6not SS's
<Drake> 04Ok
<NightSeas> 12so I'm the bad guy? lmao
<Aurora> 6nightseas...
<Kosoveon> NS, that was very insensitive of you to say that
<Kosoveon> :|
<Kosoveon> that aside
<Aurora> 6I think it's been pointed out to you several times, you don't really think
<Kosoveon> SS, it's important to collect your nerves and work through things one step at a time
<NightSeas> 12I think :|
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Aurora> 6when you see a conversation going
<Aurora> 6try reading first
<Aurora> 6repeating oneself is rather annoying, especially when something like this is being discussed
<NightSeas> 12like I said, lazy :'D
<Drake> 04...
<Aurora> 6then no sh*t, get out of the conversation
*Rukario sighs
<Rukario> this shouldn't really be in #silverwings in the first place
<Aurora> 6it's one thing to be in a conversation, but if you're going to help, you can't really be lazy
<Drake> 04I honestly don't have anything to say that accurately portrays my sheer disbelief at such callousness.
<Aurora> 6...again, things evolved into silverwings once again
<SilverSonic> its all my fault.
<SilverSonic> i brought this crap into SW
<Aurora> 6the whole moving channels thing seems to be rather difficult, it's never happened once lol
<Rukario> no it's not SilverSonic
<Kosoveon> no it's not SS
<Aurora> 6no its not
<NightSeas> 12Aurora, I was joking. I'm already reading up
<Kosoveon> you need help, we're here
<Kosoveon> NS it isn't a joke at all
<Rukario> yes... everyone needs a venting every once in awhile
<Aurora> 6right
<NightSeas> 12about being lazy
<Aurora> 6NS, remember when you made me rather pissed off?
<Aurora> 6thats where i'll leave it
<Aurora> 6anyways
<NightSeas> 12derp
<Kosoveon> SS I feel that way too a lot
<Aurora> 6SS, we are all here obviously, we've shown that. Your decision is ultimately your decision
<Xanbreon> derpies derping derpidly
<Kosoveon> there's absolutely nothing wrong with talking with people and trying to communicate your emotions
<Kosoveon> that's actually the best thing you can do
<Kosoveon> as a starting point to solve this whole thing
<Aurora> 6if you really do want people to talk to, then like Rukario said, maybe a separate channel would be better
*Rukario nods
<Rukario> keeping things inside
<Rukario> never works out very well
<Aurora> 6^
<Aurora> 6it eases tension to tell people, even more tension when people are able to help
<SilverSonic> i've kept my feelings bottled up for months.
<Drake> Well I can say from experience that wanting to talk to people makes me feel like a self-centered drama <censored>, but Rukario and Aurora are right.
<SilverSonic> i've tried VERY HARD
<SilverSonic> to keep it hidden on my show
<Aurora> 6yeah that's probably why you're so upset
<Drake> 04You need to talk to people.
<Rukario> then you probably have a lot to deflate then
<SilverSonic> a hell of a lot.
<Aurora> 6if you want to migrate that to another channel, I'm sure people will listen
<Aurora> 6you might need a night to do that
<Rukario> sadly :/
<Kosoveon> yeah, a seperate channel would be best
<Kosoveon> but again
<Rukario> i don't feel qualified to talk about relationships

<Rukario> but i'll be here if you need me
<Kosoveon> I'll prove that right now

<Rukario> is powershell hard?
<Ascendant> powershell
<drfsupercenter> 03uh
<Ascendant> is sorta like a fusion between bash and cmd
<drfsupercenter> 03use my server
<drfsupercenter> 03to load the image
<drfsupercenter> 03or something
<Ascendant> it has some from both
<Rukario> ok
<Rukario> ok
<Ascendant> laaaaaaaaag
<Rukario> i can't wait to get done with this class
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd ask you to get scriptbot back but if I'm just gonna put vsphere on
<Rukario> although i won't be done with SLI
<Rukario> CLI*
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> I can load scriptbot on this computer for the time being drf
<Rukario> i have a class next year that is focused all on SQL
<Ascendant> oh god what my eyes
<Ascendant> lol sql
<Ascendant> and Umbreon, CLI is fun
<Ascendant> it's more fun than GUI
<drfsupercenter> 03<Ascendant> oh god what my eyes <- you loaded the picture?
<Rukario> not when you are graded on it
<Ascendant> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03and dude what
<Ascendant> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03CLI is not fun
<Ascendant> CLI is fun
<drfsupercenter> 03not really
<Rukario> btw
<drfsupercenter> 03it's only fun
<Ascendant> if you know how to use it
<drfsupercenter> 03if you're spamming numbers
<Rukario> i got an 81% on my linux test
<drfsupercenter> 03and have green text
<Ascendant> nice Umbreon
<drfsupercenter> 03n a black screen
<drfsupercenter> 03+o
<Ascendant> lmao
<Rukario> most of the points i lost was because of dumb stuff that he didn't like
<drfsupercenter> 03and then fullscreen it
<Rukario> but it worked
<drfsupercenter> 03and say you're in teh Matrix
<drfsupercenter> 03I*the
<Ascendant> drf, that's my computer
<Rukario> like not putting my full name in the commenting section of the programs
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Rukario> (I used my initials)
<Rukario> then he hated my variable names and marked me off on even more points
<Ascendant> lmao
<Ascendant> wtf
<Ascendant> that's retarded
<Ascendant> bash scripting or something?
<Rukario> it was a test on 3 different ones
<Rukario> bash scripts
<Ascendant> ah
<Rukario> perl
<Ascendant> oh god perl
<Rukario> and c
<Ascendant> lol c
<Ascendant> that's fine at least
<junh1024-XD> LOL PHP
<Ascendant> at least you're not doing assembly yet
<Ascendant> LOL HTML
<junh1024-XD> i did MIPS ASM
<Rukario> i had to make a program that asked the user to insert 2 numbers
<drfsupercenter> 03oh hm
<Ascendant> that all?
<drfsupercenter> 03OK Ascendant
<Ascendant> yo
<drfsupercenter> 03my computer has 8GB of RAM
<Rukario> then have the program output a sum of both those numbers
<drfsupercenter> 03and
<Ascendant> yah
<Rukario> using all 3 of those languages
<drfsupercenter> 03VSphere says it recommends 8168MB
<drfsupercenter> 03for the VM
<Rukario> in one sitting
<drfsupercenter> 03how much smaller is that
<drfsupercenter> 03thyan 8GB
<Ascendant> uh
<drfsupercenter> 03@calc 8*1024
<junh1024-XD> = 8192
<Ascendant> 8GB is 8192
<drfsupercenter> 03@calc 8192-8162
<Ascendant> so that's 24
<junh1024-XD> = 30
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03@calc 8192-8168
<junh1024-XD> = 24
<drfsupercenter> 03that's not bad at all
<Rukario> Ascendant the thing is though
<drfsupercenter> 0324MB of RAM
<drfsupercenter> 03for vsphere
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Rukario> was that he went through each one so fast
<Ascendant> niiiice lmao
<Rukario> bash scripts we went through in a day
<Ascendant> ._.
<Rukario> we went through perl in a day
<Phase4> ^ was there ever any doubt
<Ascendant> srs?
<Rukario> then we went through c and c+ at the sametime in one day
<Ascendant> ...
<Rukario> then we reviewed then we had a test
<Ascendant> C++ and C?
<Ascendant> the fudge
<Rukario> yes
<Ascendant> bash scripting is easy
<Rukario> and he wonders why the class average for the test was 60%
<Ascendant> perl is fairly okay apparently
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03now I need to figure out
<drfsupercenter> 03how the frick to install an OS
<Ascendant> but C AND C++?
<Ascendant> that's not easy
<drfsupercenter> 03it has this weird datastore thing
<drfsupercenter> 03I can't just toss it an ISO
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't think anyway
<Ascendant> C++ is retarded in more ways than I can comprehend
<Ascendant> and it's not even in minimal english either
<Ascendant> like python or perl
<Ascendant> o_O
<Ascendant> huh
<Ascendant> ask Xanbreon
<Rukario> c+ wasn't really in the test
<drfsupercenter> 03oh wait
<junh1024-XD> i learnt C++ before c
<drfsupercenter> 03I can upload the ISO to it
<junh1024-XD> `-`
<drfsupercenter> 03for Windows
<Rukario> i think the only question that even regarded c+ was what was the compiler for it
<RX-78-2-SweetieBot> surprised something saying somethign bad about trixie got posted on EQD....
<NightSeas> 12[23:02] <junh1024-XD> i learnt C++ before c
<NightSeas> 12same
<Rukario> i don't know either
<Rukario> i only made it through because the test was openbook
<drfsupercenter> 03God dang it
<drfsupercenter> 03I can't figure out how to get the stupid ISO loaded
<Rukario> i love how the teacher made it a scantron as well
<drfsupercenter> 03OMG
<drfsupercenter> 03this wants to take forever to load the ISO
<drfsupercenter> 0359 minutes remaining >_>

<drfsupercenter> 03now we install WIndows on the virtual server and see how it runs
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant how much space would you need for the Linux portion of the server?
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> how much do you have?
<drfsupercenter> 03500GB total
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd like at least 400 for WIndows
<drfsupercenter> 03vsphere eats about 4-5GB
<Ascendant> I don't need 100GB...
<drfsupercenter> 03for itself
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03right
<drfsupercenter> 03so how much do you need
<drfsupercenter> 0325? 50? LOL
<Ascendant> o_O
<drfsupercenter> 03100MB?
*drfsupercenter hides
<Ascendant> lmaaaaaaao
<drfsupercenter> 03no but seriously
<drfsupercenter> 03about how much would you want
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just thinking this through
<Ascendant> I'll go with 20GB at least
<Ascendant> 20-30
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<Ascendant> up to you
<drfsupercenter> 0325?
<Ascendant> I don't really mind
<drfsupercenter> 03that's probably easiest
<Ascendant> sure
<drfsupercenter> 03alright
<Ascendant> though
<Ascendant> linux will need swap space
<Ascendant> just saying
<drfsupercenter> 03then I'd get around 460-470 for me
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03if I give you 512MB of RAM
<drfsupercenter> 03then that's 512MB of swap ;P
<Ascendant> that's 512mb of swap
<Ascendant> yeah that's fine
<Ascendant> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Ascendant> 25 is fine
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03alright
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL it taking forever to expand Windows files over the network
<drfsupercenter> 03but whatever
<Ascendant> lmao
<drfsupercenter> 03It was going to take me over an hour to transfer an ISO from here to there
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like [You're f***ing kidding me.jpg]

<Ascendant> hey drf, give me 784mb of ram too!
*Ascendant hides
<Ascendant> nah 512mb is fiiiiine
*Ascendant then explodes the server with memory leaks
<Ascendant> oops
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm still testing if it's efficient with the RAM in the first place
<junh1024-XD> drf do u hav axs to hoshibox?
<drfsupercenter> 03yes, why
<SilverSonic> oh how i love platinum notes

<TheRainbowDash> Saturn: So, did you think, before pursing a computer science degree, any other job/profession? (i.e.: Electrical Engineer) Yeah, did you think of becoming an engineer before pusing this degree?:P
<Saturn> 08,01the field motes don't need to be able to see the sink mote direclty; they just need a path to it through active motes
*Trixie tie s
<LunaTheBeloved> I thought I got rid of these
<pablez94> Chrysalis: midnight in our time zone,right?
*DeathStar punches Shane377 back :)
<cow334> Meanwhile: doges it wow WOW chill bro throw a knife when you turned back around
<TheRainbowDash> (pursing)
<Saturn> 08,01so basically, the motes will all act as routers, routing reading packets to the sink mote
<Meanwhile> Rainbow: I mean not here. As in absent. As in in a location that is somewhere other than this one.
<Saturn> 08,01it's kinda awesome

<DeathStar> Anotherguy: Wrek being awesome

<Xanbreon> >;[
<Biglaw> Question for everypony: Which pony do you think you are most like IRL?

*Meanwhile dusts LunaTheBeloved.
<Biglaw> I feel I am a fluttershy person
<drfsupercenter> 03an eon is a unit of time
<drfsupercenter> 03so I suppose that makes sense
*LunaTheBeloved rolls around laughing
<cow334> TheRainbowDash: what is a luzs link

<flutter_spin> ...without the books, oddly enough
<Xanbreon> derp
<Rainbow> Anotherguy: Yes, it's true. I'm awesome!
<rocklobster> I luv propane so ill be like applejack :D
<Meanwhile> Which pony am I most like irl? Pinkamena.

<Meanwhile> Would never have guessed. :P
<Xanbreon> banning someone for being an idiot is valid
<LonelyPony> Biglaw: Applejack minus the accent :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile no need to worry more about me saying it ~ i think it's getting boring now ~
<RaveBrony> Meanwhile is scary pony

<NightSeas> 2nope
<nickstr> you are calling someone who has a different opinion than you do an idiot
<drfsupercenter> 03well, idiot is subjective
<Xanbreon> I dont really think ethics come into banning people from resources
<TheRainbowDash> Actually, scratch that.
<FlareChaser> Which pony am I most like in real life? umm...Half Pinkie and Half Twilight Sparkle.
<nickstr> that is pretty shallow
<drfsupercenter> 03who I think is an idiot other people would disagree

*Meanwhile would wonder how high this couch is, since he's probably shorter than LunaTheBeloved.
<FlareChaser> Fine, I wont pirate it...
<Wrek|Observing> 05its a fraction of the price
<DashWithRainbows> Wrek|Observing How much was it?
<Powny> okay now i have the name of this programm now the next question where can i buy this awesome painting skills ?
<pavarkian> but pirating ist fun
<flutter_spin> Not a hard worker. Not confident or honest about yourself. Yeah... totally not me.
<LunaTheBeloved> How tall are you?
<otakon> Wrek|Observing: well, a fraction of any price is still too much for one that is broke as the Ponyville Town Center

*Scoot-Scootaloo faints
<TheRainbowDash> Wrek|Observing: ...keep at this picture, ok?:D
<Soital> 12that problem is for you

<pony_1900> what is that thing?
<Wrek|Observing> 05and some d'aaw to finish the night off
*RX-78-3-SweetieBot slowly backs out of the room
<Soital> 12> you get 3 figures with the game
<RaveBrony> <3
<drfsupercenter> 03most games, you buy them and you can play the entire fricking game
<drfsupercenter> 03not if you buy it used
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello SweetieBot
<pony_1900> daw
<drfsupercenter> 03ahjem
<drfsupercenter> 03-j
<FlareChaser> D'awwww
<NightSeas> 2drf, the only reason they make games is to make money
<Biglaw> I can't wait to get my tablet /)^3^(\
<Soital> 12> you can beat full story mode with the 3 figures
<icybeauti> cow334, TheRainbowDash Most of them...

<Anotherguy> Looked weird at the beginning but daww
<Drake> 04>pirate
<Soital> 12buy the game
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=CJkWS4t4l0k
<Drake> 04>entire argument invalid
<drfsupercenter> 03>buying games
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> lol
<Soital> 12properly and you would
<Biglaw> lol spike
<TheRainbowDash> And D'awwww..
<icybeauti> cow334 me and my messed up ness :$
<drfsupercenter> 03fine, say I bought it used
<pony_1900> is that a condom in spikes hand?
<nickstr> «%drfsupercenter» it prolly won't happen right away but at least I can sign the forms and stuff saying I won't violate FCC laws <-- if you have any doubts I can actually bring up the FCC rules and regulations for broadcasters
<drfsupercenter> 03and it didn't come with those
<Narolas> Hnnnnnggg
<Bronysith> thats just sad
<Bronysith> very sad
<Soital> 12then that would be stupid
<FlareChaser> Its so..cute... Hnnng
<Wrek|Observing> 05its a jewel you dirty colt
<TheRainbowDash> pony_1900: O_O....possibly...
<drfsupercenter> 03nickstr, well considering I'd just be playing 80s and 90s dance music, it shouldn't be a problem
<mario_pony> no
<Bronysith> like this http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/44/
<Soital> 12doubt they'd sell the game on its own in the shop though
<cow334> icybeauti: yup its an mestory
<drfsupercenter> 03none of these songs have any profanity in them XD
<TheRainbowDash> Hahaha:D
<Drake> 04It's just a way to curb resales and get more money
<nickstr> yep
<Soital> 12pretty much
<Krakass> I thought Spike was holding a pack of ciagarettes
<Sylandest> that's an adorable picture. and hello, everypony!
<Shane377> anyone heard Ich Will before
<Narolas> gotta admit, uncolored jewel looks like a condom
<Soital> 12but I still like it
<drfsupercenter> 03<NightSeas> drf, the only reason they make games is to make money <- so you're OK paying way more than a game is actually worth just because "they need to make money"?
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Its the onion, its just silly
<Soital> 12so no problems
<RaveBrony> I thot it was a pack of cigs in Spikes hand at first :o but then i came to my senses :P
<nickstr> I have located the complete United States CFR or code of federal regulations
<cow334> (O )_____(o) wy would yall think that
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Sylandest! (waves)
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello Sylandest.
<Biglaw> TBH I thought twilight compared to a human would've been taller
<icybeauti> cow334 I've been messed up since little. Around 10, I discoverd the other side of stuff.
*Sylandest waves at TheRainbowDash and ZappyTheUnicorn
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm fine paying for *good* games, but I absolutely refuse to buy crap with DRM
<nickstr> including CFR 47 which is the FCC portion
<Narolas> Humans would be freaking giants in equestria then O_o
<Sylandest> everyone doing good today?
<cow334> icybeauti: oh god im sorry
<Anotherguy> icybeauti You found your butt?
<TheRainbowDash> icybeauti: Only a few months ago, I discovered it. Now, I'm hooked to that stuff.
<cow334> hello Sylandest
<NightSeas> 2Drf, I don’t mind piracy, I even pirate a few things myself but I don’t like it when you try to get other people to.
<drfsupercenter> 03I think the only regulations for this station is that we have to say the name of the station every X amount of minutes
<cow334> TheRainbowDash: please dont do that
<Sylandest> howdy, cow334!
<nickstr> every hour
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Sylandest: Eeyup. Are you doing good?
<Shane377> wrek u streaming music aswell
<cow334> hello Sylandest how are you
<nickstr> at the very least
<Wrek|Observing> 05y
<TheRainbowDash> cow334: Wait, what...
<drfsupercenter> 03I think it's more often for ours
<drfsupercenter> 03as the shows are only an hour long
<nickstr> that is called the top of hour legal ID
<Bronysith> damn it i hate getting cut and not realizing im cut
<Narolas> Hahaha, now that's a nice jewel :D
<FlareChaser> Needs more Flare Chaser x Colgate... <.< >.> Nah, I already got enough pics of that, haha...
<icybeauti> cow334 It's cool. Anotherguy: Sorta :/ TheRainbowDash Ga-ross!
<Bronysith> or remember getting cut
<Wrek|Observing> 05Biglaw: its the angle
<FlareChaser> But, Wrek this is so..D'awww
<cow334> TheRainbowDash: nothing moooooo
<TheRainbowDash> Aww....:D
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure if it's different for a low-power station
<FlareChaser> Its just...so...D'aww
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> who want's to watch an awesome series ? you do ? here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUDfoZGhLjE
<Kandarihu> Well, the show is called My LITTLE Pony. They should logically be smaller in stature than a human.
<Biglaw> I calculated I've been a Brony for about 9 weeks, the first episode being Daring Do *most recent at the time*
<TheRainbowDash> Well, actuall, it was...5 years ago, my bad.
<nickstr> I operate under CFR 47 part 97 and there are reduced ID times for that
<cow334> i dont no who would clop to ponys that is just sick
<Wrek|Observing> 05my headcanon is that a normal pony is between knee and waist height of a human
<icybeauti> What, I didn't want to flood accidentally.
<nickstr> every ten minutes
<Biglaw> Wrek|Observing ah makes sense
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah that's probably right
<nickstr> part 97 by the way is amateur radio
<drfsupercenter> 03I was thinking every 10 or 20
<Sylandest> cow334: I'm doing pretty good, working on an essay for Communications. how about you?
<NightSeas> 2that's up to you if you want to take the risk of pirating things
<drfsupercenter> 03"risk"
<drfsupercenter> 03just don't be an idiot and you'll be fine
<FlareChaser> Wrek|Observing: I have the same prediction.
<drfsupercenter> 03so yeah, I can understand why you're scared
*drfsupercenter hides
<icybeauti> I've been a brony since june of last year. It'll be my 1 year anniversary this year.
<Wrek|Observing> 05asskisser.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> btw i'm bored so expect random things at random times
<Shane377> Wrek u should try Ich Will
<FlareChaser> icybeauti: Happy anniversary! :D
<NightSeas> 2hm? I'm just as bad as you when it comes to that XD
<Kandarihu> And frankly, keep in mind that some of the G1 cartoons featured humans. Compare the ponies to the human children they worked with, and compare the children to adult humans, and that's how tall we would be to the ponies.
<icybeauti> Shane377 ehmagawd I love that song!!
<Wrek|Observing> 05i dont take requests, besides i dont feel liek rammstein atm
<cow334> Sylandest: i was in a fight today cause high schoolers dont no when to shut up but other than that i pass my ultra hard teas
<cow334> *test
<TheRainbowDash> Awesome then icybeauti!
<Shane377> theres rammstein sonne pmv
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Well, I was able to stop listening to This Day Aria....because I got this stuck in my head ALL DAY LONG http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29-q7YnyUmY
<NightSeas> 2but I'd never ask someone eles to
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Biglaw> cow334 shoukda loved and tolerated the S*yay*t out of them
<cow334> Sylandest: and you are the first person i told that to on here
<NightSeas> 2else*
<Sylandest> cow334: ooh, i see. I hope you're alright?
<twilight_sprinkle> cow334: wtf dont fight people.
<Kandarihu> We would probably be too big to actually ride them.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not telling people to pirate games, but I';m against blindly throwing money away because the developers tell you to.
<drfsupercenter> 03Case in point, Ubisoft
<pony_1900> speaking of songs, this day aria was best
<icybeauti> mhmm. They should hide famous people as backround ponies, the way they did with "The Big Lebewski"
<Krakass> Cookie monster singing Du Hast is the best
<cow334> Biglaw: no i couldnt i tryd to but no i couldnt
<Kandarihu> Anyway, I need to restart my computer.
<Anotherguy> Kandarihu Don't
<Bronysith> im still trying to get winter wrap up outta my head
<drfsupercenter> 03You actually get a better experience if you pirate the game due to their stupid DRM :P
<cow334> im sorry twilight_sprinkle
<Soital> 12they don't
<Dark_Horst> cow334: actually, if you take a look at the human mind and take into account the sexualization of cute that our society has going on all the time, it's the only logical conclusion.
<icybeauti> Krakass /)
<Bronysith> and the best pet
<Randomnerd> http://tinyurl.com/7u88jf3
<Soital> 12I know what stuff is going on
<Biglaw> cow334 that's okay
<Krakass> (\
<Soital> 12I know they're charging a lot for such
<Soital> 12but I enjoy it
<Soital> 12done
<Soital> 12=>
<twilight_sprinkle> cow334: it better not happen again, or ill kick yo ass
<drfsupercenter> 03they make you buy stupid plastic figurines to unlock features
<TheRainbowDash> pony_1900: It was an awesome song, indeed, but not my favorite. That title goes to Smile or Winter Wrap Up.:)
<cow334> Dark_Horst: well okay
<Chrysalis> this day was going to be perfect?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's as bad as it gets
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<Randomnerd> I had to shave this off. I cannot wait for my beard to grow back right and proper.
<hoofy_potter> nothing good on right now... Ill be back for movie night on friday
<cow334> twilight_sprinkle: well i didnt win the fight
<Soital> 12...
<RoboGerbil> hmm i turned on my desktop ponys last night with 2 random ponys and trixies stage... now i have 9 different ponys and the 2 i started with are gone :P
<Soital> 12doood
<Angel_Umbreon> 13These "stupid plastic figurines" also happen to be collectibles to some people, deal with it :P
<Soital> 12play the game before you get to know it
<Narolas> I'm truly amazed at how fast the songs of the finale were remixed/used, just a few hours after the the second part there was already an Archie remix of love is in bloom :O
<Bronysith> ha
<cow334> but i didnt cry ethier i never cry
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't WANT to play it because >DRM
<Kandarihu> Anotherguy: don't what? Don't think of riding them (which I shot down) or don't restart (which I need to do more often)
<NightSeas> 2drf, what if they made you pay that and you didn't get them? XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I've said this ehough
<Kandarihu> ?
<icybeauti> We should make PMV out of wolfmother songs. They have one song called "White Unicorn" and it'd be a perfect rarity vid.
<Randomnerd> Mmm Cadence Aria.
<Soital> 12you can literally beat the game with the figures they provide you when you get the game
<Dark_Horst> cow334: that said, it is quite surprising how many are supposedly repelled by the thought.
<twilight_sprinkle> cow334: i wouldnt expect you to, obviously it was a provocation and you fell for it
<Wrek|Observing> 05ok 1 last song
<Litwick> and suddenly Twilight
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but there's obviously stuff ou can't do without buying more
<drfsupercenter> 03*you
<mario_pony> ....
<Anotherguy> Kandarihu Both?
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> >Randomnerd has biker beard
<Dark_Horst> bottom line: people lie B)
<drfsupercenter> 03<NightSeas> drf, what if they made you pay that and you didn't get them? XD <- This is exactly why I pirate games, btw
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<pony_1900> smexy twi
<Soital> 12if you're OCD 100% everything then yes
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT im watching it now its good
<Soital> 12you would need
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Thats just silly and awesome
<Soital> 12roughly
<Shane377> wrek then whats happening after the last songZ?
<TheRainbowDash> Alright then Wrek|Observing, do you know who would be streaming next after you?
<icybeauti> twilightlicious
<Soital> 125 more figures at the least
<Anotherguy> I know this song
<drfsupercenter> 03Let me put it this way
<Randomnerd> Yup. I was a space-trucker this weekend, lol
<WindWhistler> I'm hoping SuperBrony64 will
<drfsupercenter> 03Ubisoft games
<drfsupercenter> 03are like
<FlareChaser> Brushie Brushie Brushie.
<Wrek|Observing> 05no clue
<Narolas> He, twilight's nice with glasses, never though of that
<TheRainbowDash> Oh....
<drfsupercenter> 03"You can't even play single player if you're disconnected from our servers for 'anti piracy reasons'"
<drfsupercenter> 03OK finme
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Soital> 12> Your opinion
<drfsupercenter> 03their servers die for a day
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> get ready to use 3 hours of your life part 2 and 3 are about one 1:30 long and part 4 is not out muahahaha
<Shane377> is SuperBrony64 even there
<Soital> 12> Not mine
<drfsupercenter> 03You can't play the game
<drfsupercenter> 03that YOU PAID FOR
<Randomnerd> (I was in a scenario paintball game based on "Spaceballs"
<drfsupercenter> 03because THEIR servers died
<cow334> twilight_sprinkle: what i won the last time the only reason and i say the only reason he won is cause he got his little bic_ of friends and they jumep me i lasted for a while but i couldnt do it they are mean and i dont like them
<drfsupercenter> 03Greatest idea ever, right?
<TheRainbowDash> SuperBrony64: You there?
<Soital> 12whut
<Soital> 12LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03But if you just pirated the games, no problems.
<FlareChaser> Narolas: Well, it gives her the more...'Sexy' look.
<drfsupercenter> 03Soital, true story
<icybeauti> I noticed Dr.Whoove getting attacked by the changlings in the episode. I thought he was goign to bust out the screwdriver and kill them :D.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's why Ubisoft basically rage-quitted the PC gaming industry
<drfsupercenter> 03because everybody complained about THEIR stupid policies
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<twilight_sprinkle> cow334: last time? wtf is with all the fighting
<Narolas> Kinda, it's the nerdy feeling it gives that i like
<TheRainbowDash> FlareChaser: I really like that sexy looks of Twilight....so...inviting to me.... - Dash
<Soital> 12this isn't ubisoft though
<drfsupercenter> 03It still makes me laugh how idiotic they ewre being
<drfsupercenter> 03*were
<Soital> 12Meh
<NightSeas> 2it's Activision
<drfsupercenter> 03but the point still stands, you can't play the game without having extra addons that require you to pay money
<cow334> twilight_sprinkle: well last tim is cause he wouldnt shut up about me likeing the show so i told him to box it out
<Krakass> icybeauti, Dr. Whooves doesn't kill.
<drfsupercenter> 03say I were to borrow the game from a friend
<Soital> 12> Judging game even though not played it
<Soital> 12;3
<Anotherguy> TheRainbowDash Did you hit that?
<drfsupercenter> 03they didn't want to loan me the figures because "they're collectibles"
<Krakass> Well usually he doesn't
<drfsupercenter> 03that means I can't play the stupid thing
<Soital> 12Nope
<cow334> and Dark_Horst well okay its not my opion
<TheRainbowDash> Aww yeah, this song!:)
<FlareChaser> TheRainbowDash: That reminds me... *googles Colgate* Alright, time to find socks.
<drfsupercenter> 03catch my drift?
<Soital> 12you can play the game
<icybeauti> Krakass Or drive them away in that case.
<cow334> *opionion
<Soital> 12to the end
<Kandarihu> Well...... see ya later.
<TheRainbowDash> Anotherguy: Aww yeah, sure I did!

<Wrek|Observing> 05yes twilight, I'd love to read you a bedtime story
<Soital> 12then you have to get the figures
*Shane377 licks Wrek
<twilight_sprinkle> cow334: youre mad at a guy cuz he made fun of you being a brony?..
<Narolas> :O
<TheRainbowDash> Wrek|Observing: I'm sorry, Twilight already left....:P
<Krakass> Pluse Dr. Whooves still hasn't figured out how to hold his screwdriver.
<twilight_sprinkle> stay away from Twi, Wrek...

<Narolas> Hm, not sure i like those pony faces, they're cool but i like my normal faces too :-O
<drfsupercenter> 03you can finish the game without having any of the figurines?
<Skylands> 10Okay yeah, you guys have all made your points. DRF, no need to further drag it out
<Krakass> Yup

<cow334> icybeauti: i know i wish it would have an end to it
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello XAX.
<drfsupercenter> 03right, and on the Xbox 360 you'd have to transfer the entire save for something like that LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03also
<Wrek|Observing> 05hope ya liked
<drfsupercenter> 03>Gamefly or similar services
<pony_1900> like a sexy librarian
<Bronysith> its for the ds right
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it's
<drfsupercenter> 03if I were to get the game as a rental
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not going to come with figurines
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Dark_Horst> cow334: with painfull touches to the nose and mouth area, i hope?
<Shane377> bad news is that knowing rockstar they'll stick to their normal release dates of mayish which means next may
<Krakass> Spectacular Wrek|Observing. Also nice job with the wood carving.
<Narolas> Any movies/series planned for tonight ? (or whatever time of fay it is for you) ?

<Krakass> Once you get out of high school people are still just as stupid.
<twilight_sprinkle> cow334: how long till graduation
<drfsupercenter> 03They're effectively saying "pay us lots of money or gtfo"
<Krakass> But they don't take it out on others.
<cow334> Krakass: no it will never
<WindWhistler> I hope SuperBrony64 grabs the stream....
<Dark_Horst> cow334: you go, bro!
<Litwick> can we switch back to mips now?
<Soital> 12your best bet is to try it at a friends
<icybeauti> cow334 It stops in college. But the reason he stapled his tongue was because he did it himself.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> thanks for the stream Wrek|Observing ~
<drfsupercenter> 03so how about this, you want me to play the game first before I judge it? You buy it for me then :P
<Shane377> ^^

<Soital> 12Personally I can't wait~ <3
<Drake> 04What?
<FlareChaser> RaveBrony: Work harder, and you will someday will be good as Wrek!
<drfsupercenter> 03being somebody who wants to go into the computer industry, I won't stand for things like digital rights management. The actual game itself is irrelevant. If Pokémon made a game that required you to buy crappy figures in order to play it, I'd be every bit against it
<RaveBrony> :P
<Drake> 04I expressed my opinion of Skylanders.
<mario_pony> CCCP: lol boom headshot
<Dark92Enigma> Hellllllllllllllo everypony!
<cow334> wait icybeauti no links or you can get banned
<TheRainbowDash> http://fav.me/d4xfkf5b Here is the awesome poster for Season 2!:)

<RainbowCupcakeBath> http://rainbowcupcakebath.deviantart.com/#/d4xgdnu - Please tell me if it's any good ;)
<icybeauti> FlareChaser 20% cooler
<pony_1900> her eyes were the same color as her glasses right?
<Randomnerd> Krakass: Lemme guess: Invasion of Normandy?
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> besides, if you want it nearly endless theres a 10 hour long version
<XAX> TheRainbowDash: It's... Bootiful.
<Drake> 04Eons are also floofy, for the most part.
<mario_pony> icybeauti: yes you can
<Drake> 04hey drf
<Soital> 12Hmm
<mario_pony> icybeauti: by other girls
<Xanbreon> ... an eon is not a unit of time
<Drake> 04We could get into an argument about plane and plain as well if you want
<cow334> twilight_sprinkle: tommorow if i see him im going to go up to him and fight him one on one
<TheRainbowDash> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/04/season-2-finale-sets-rating-records.html Ponies has set records and higher standards!:)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> You won't see curses if you don't piss off Val
<drfsupercenter> 03"You keep using that word, I don't think you know what it means" is my response to people referring to "eons" as something other than a unit of time
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Biglaw> FlareChaser: You make that shirt 20% cooler
<Krakass> Randomnerd, I can't remember what the scenario was. Wayne Dollack put it on.
<icybeauti> mario_pony Where I live, girls don't beat up each other. It's more verbal stuff.
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: Exactly!
<Xanbreon> its an Aeon
<drfsupercenter> 03Xanbreon it's representative of a long time
<Angel_Umbreon> 13Why do I keep typing twitter instead of imgur into the url
<Soital> 12NightSeas, and anyone who has the game, what figures have you got dood? :3
<Xanbreon> not eon
<Drake> 04LOL ANGEL
<Xanbreon> >___<
<rdibp> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4507/
<drfsupercenter> 03>Says we'll change the subject
<Espeon> 06yeah because it totally isn't a rather wwidely used word for eeveelutions
<mario_pony> cow334: don't do it
<drfsupercenter> 03>Asks about the same subject
<Randomnerd> Girls are so cruel to one another :(
<Biglaw> FlareChaser Btw thanks for the comment /)^3^(\
<twilight_sprinkle> cow334: whatever. it wont solve anything, but do what you want.
<icybeauti> Randomnerd ikr
<drfsupercenter> 03also Espeon, the only place I've ever heard it used as such is in this channel. LOL
*drfsupercenter math and science geek
<NightSeas> 2I have all the starters so far :3
<CCCP> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4502/

<Randomnerd> You're down south, then?
<Drake> 04drf
<NightSeas> 2yep
<drfsupercenter> 03it's pronounced the same way o_O
<cow334> mario_pony: but wy he one bye cheating he cant do that its not fair
<Soital> 12<3
<Biglaw> when I see two girls fightin' I do this face :[
<Xanbreon> Unless ur spelling it weirdly
<Drake> 04maybe that's because you don't really hang out with people who use it elsewhere?
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: lol
<Derpy_Hooves> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sob1t-iUCmE :V
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :D
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle: :3
<TheRainbowDash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzsxfO7dBlA "This Day Aria":)
<mario_pony> cow334: you're just gonna make it worse
<Anotherguy> I saw girls fighting for a shirt. Srsly.
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: i looooooove that song :D
<Biglaw> Anotherguy wow...
<Randomnerd> Hell yeah, Cadence Aria.
<TheRainbowDash> Aww yeah CCCP!:D
<rdibp> excuse me for a moment
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm on other IRC channels too, just because they aren't all "OMFG EEVEELUTIONS ARE THE BEST THING KNOWN TO MAN AND YOU'RE A SINNER IF YOU DIAGREE" doesn't mean I don't hang out with other POkémon fans.
<mario_pony> Anotherguy: JB shirt?
<drfsupercenter> 03and nobody else uses it as such.
<CCCP> :$
<Soital> 12and I don't see problems asking a question about something I was talking about dood
<Soital> 12but I digress
<Xanbreon> Context
<Soital> 12too many eons ;3
<Anotherguy> A shirt you could get anywhere
<drfsupercenter> 03also wtf, each version of the game has its own figurines?
*drfsupercenter vomits even more
<TheRainbowDash> CCCP: It is that time of the day where you listen to this song non-stop for 24 hours?:D
<cow334> mario_pony: fine i wont do it your right ill be the bigger person and let go of it
<Randomnerd> AWWWWWW YEEEEAH
<Soital> 12?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's just plain abusive.
<Narolas> You ponies have seen the interrobang pie version of This day aria ?
<NightSeas> 2no drf, just the 3DS
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: yes! lol
<Narolas> tIt amaaaazing
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<Bronysith> yes i am
<Drake> 04drf
<Biglaw> what is it randomnerd?
<Narolas> it's*
<Drake> the <censored> man
<otakon> there we go
<Soital> 12yeah
<Espeon> 06hahahahahaha
<otakon> did I miss Wrek|Observing?
<Espeon> 06sorry but
<Biglaw> otakon yep
<FlareChaser> You're*
<mario_pony> cow334: pinkie promise?
<Espeon> 06the last 20 minutes or so various things like irony and such has just been OFF DA CHARTS
<cow334> otakon: no he is still streaming
<pony_1900> so im getting this tiny video window saying i dont have the right plugin, should i click that or close it?
<Randomnerd> Biglaw: It's AWWWWW YEEEEAH for the Aria.
<Biglaw> He is?
<Wrek|Observing> 05no im not
<Xanbreon> I find you equating physical objects to DRM to be tenuous at best
<otakon> that's weird, I've got nothing on LimeV
<cow334> mario_pony: yes i give you my pinke promise
<Soital> 12I kinda understand what people mean now anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03it IS though
<Randomnerd> aha
<Biglaw> cow334 recite it
<Shizuka> 13[18:30] [@ValtheJean] alright everyone, give me some time to set up
<Cypresswolf> O_o How in the world did I sleep for 2.5 hours?
<drfsupercenter> 03you have to have the figurines to beat the game, plain and simple
<Krakass> I bet he's from Georgia
<Anotherguy> pony_1900 Is it a ad?
<cow334> Biglaw: okay
<Biglaw> Okie Dokie Lokie!
<CCCP> yay!
<Narolas> Hell yeah, valthejean
<Bronysith> eeeyup
<drfsupercenter> 03It would be one thing if they were just collectable and didn't actually affect the agme in any way
<otakon> yay Shizuka thank you love
<Randomnerd> That was a question for Krakass though
<Soital> 12> can't talk about something you'd like to talk about with others if majority of people dislike it
<Biglaw> Buck Yeah!
<drfsupercenter> 03but they're forcing you to buy stuff in order to beat a game you already paid for
<Drake> 04drf, Skylanders is different to other games by the use of figures.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol
<Espeon> 06isn't the solution simple anyay
<Bronysith> eeeyup
<Drake> 04Don't like it? Don't play the game.
<Espeon> 06don't like it, don't play it
<Krakass> I'm originally from PA and now I'm in ND
<Xanbreon> Its part of the way the game works, its not something simply designed to limit your ability to use the game
<twilight_sprinkle> {o{
<Drake> 04Espeon
<Biglaw> Can we watch G4 ponies?
<Drake> 04Hivemind
<Andrew-_Teh-Epic> ;._>+_>__._>_
<cow334> mario_pony: i cross my heart hope to fly stick a cupcake in my eye
<TheRainbowDash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R90qzCl5m8 If you like pnies and Minecraft together, this might be of intrest to you.:)
<otakon> I can guess what we're gonna watch
<drfsupercenter> 03Espeon, that's like saying "Don't like what Kony is doing in Africa? Don't support him"
<Randomnerd> PA so you've played at Skirmish USA?
<drfsupercenter> 03but yet
<drfsupercenter> 03Look at the Internet
<WallDives> good evening all.
<Krakass> Yup
<Soital> 12sigh
<WindWhistler> Gosh darnit where's SuperBrony64
<drfsupercenter> 03Somebody has to be against it >_>
<otakon> hiya WallDives
<Randomnerd> Cool
<FlareChaser> http://www.lolbrary.com/content/278/you-a-stupid-hoe-14278.jpg this is me when I turn grammar nazi.
<otakon> WindWhistler: school I think
<twilight_sprinkle> WallDives: bonjourno
<Krakass> That's where it was
<CCCP> Im sorry for posting this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__HeE6NWmDE
<TheRainbowDash> (ponies)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 unfortunate
<Soital> 12thats fine and everything if you don't like it, just don't want to hear it 100 times
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, I WAS gonna show off my new audio cable and stream my PSP
<Xanbreon> When you say physical DRM, what comes to mind are dongles for example for highend CAD software
<twilight_sprinkle> aw
<otakon> :'(
<Vordox> Guys....
<Espeon> 06yeah because the kony situation is the same as VIDEO GAMES
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but for some reason getting the audio now disables the video
<cow334> ValtheJean: wy
<Krakass> The game got paused at 2am because someone twisted their ankle in a groundhog hole
<Cypresswolf> that feel when you know you were supposed to do something but need to rest your eyes first, then forget whatever it was you were supposed to do....
<Espeon> 06i know you meant it as an example but
<Espeon> 06wtc
<cow334> ValtheJean: no stream it please
<NightSeas> 2Okay so, some people like Skylands and others don’t. We’re going to leave it at that.
<Drake> 04"Look at X someone has to be against it". Ok sure.
<mario_pony> cow334: yaay~
<Xanbreon> Also that Kony <censored> was so funny
<Randomnerd> Ow.
<otakon> Sweetie Belle: OH COME ON!
<drfsupercenter> 03hey, neither situation is personally affecting me
<NightSeas> 2Anyone who wants to talk about talk about it and people who have a problem with that need to keep to themselves
<Vordox> BRONYSTATE, WHY DO YOU HAVE PORNOGRAPHIC ADS?! This is WAY too severe.
<TheRainbowDash> CCCP: Wait, what the hay is this? I never seen this before.:P
<Drake> 04That's like
<WallDives> wait, what?
<cow334> mario_pony: yaay
<Biglaw> ValtheJean why not record from a mic?
<Wrek|Observing> 05we dont
<otakon> cow334: no sound or no video, he can't
<Drake> 04completely logical way to look at the world.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Otakon: I can only stream the video or the sound
<drfsupercenter> 03NightSeas, that's lopsided though
<XAX> Cypresswolf: Dat feel...
<drfsupercenter> 03>Freedom of speech
<Xanbreon> People really though that anything would actually change
<Anotherguy> Vordox Wrong site I believe
<Bronysith> that sucks
<TheRainbowDash> Vordox: Wait, you see those on your screen now?
<cow334> otakon: oh okay
<Bronysith> lols
<Vordox> You just had a pornographic add.
<Bobeh> Hi everypony :)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and recording from my mic would record my annoying family
<Randomnerd> Stuff like that happense from time to time, seeing as it's a all outdoors.
<drfsupercenter> 03if you're allowed to say how much you love something
<otakon> ValtheJean: I know, cow334 asked
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm allowed to say how much I hate it
<Wrek|Observing> 05the streamprovider may have, but thats not us. if thats the case, get some fucking adblock
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Bobeh! (waves)
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: its some crappy music video that is worse than friday
<Soital> 12Just can't believe I can't talk about something I was probably going to discuss with others who may like it for 5 mins and get rar'd at LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03It's plain and simple.
<Sylandest> howdy, bobeh
<Drake> 04god
<Biglaw> Hey Bobeh1
<Drake> 04you know
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Vordox: the adds are based on the computer that visits
<Drake> 04I'm gonna shut up
<Biglaw> Hey Bobeh!
<Drake> 04because
<WallDives> hi Bobeh.
<Espeon> 06you know i
<Narolas> Ads are linked to your searches and visited websites, probably ... lawl
<cow334> otakon: hehe troll face
<Drake> 04this is playing hell
<Espeon> 06100% predicted that
<Vordox> I'm not adblocking this site, it would not benefit the cause of the stream.
<pony_1900> :D
<Drake> 04on my mood
<otakon> Wrek|Observing: I never heard of fuking adblock, is it any good?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so it must have seen your browsing history and played you pornographic sites
<XAX> Lololol
<Wrek|Observing> 05Vordox. yes it would
<Anotherguy> Ouch
<CCCP> lol
<Vordox> But the ads is a revenue, no?
<Wrek|Observing> 05cause it would keep people complainign liek you are now out of the chat
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: yep, ads are dependant on what you visit
<Wrek|Observing> 05not to us
<Wrek|Observing> 05its not oru adds
<Krakass> Vordox, bronystate doesn't have ads for revenue
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i never seen a single add on bronystate o right i have add block on ifrefox lol
<Xanbreon> freedom of speak does not mean you have the right to force people to hear your speech
<Wrek|Observing> 05our*
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the ads don't generate us money
<ValtheJean> 2,14 at all
<TheRainbowDash> CCCP: Holy hay, this is bad.:D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 we make a grand total of 0 dollars
<Espeon> 06freedom of speech, #1 get out of jail free card besides "Joke's on you I was only pretending to be retarded, i troll u!"
<Shizuka> 13we do it out of pocket
<Ghosties> 04We're not getting any money
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: ikr
<NightSeas> 2drf, so you're saying if it's okay to hug someone it's also okay to punch them?
<Vordox> Ah, geezus. ><
<drfsupercenter> 03um, what?
<TheRainbowDash> The mods come now....out of their lurking areas...:D
<Vordox> I thought it was that.
<Randomnerd> happens*
<Shizuka> 13we make a grand total of -{cost of internet for 19+ mods}
<drfsupercenter> 03how is physically hurting someone relating to just saying things o_O
<Skylands> 10Espeon, lolMonopoly
<CCCP> Vordox: delet your cookies
<Vordox> Also, I have never visted that ad, should probably do a virus scan also.
<RoflBot> 0 dollars are better than no dollars
<WallDives> ...
<Krakass> Shizuka, have thought of accepting ads from Stallionbate?
<FlareChaser> RoflBot: 0 dollars is no dollars...
<Biglaw> RoflBot not really
<twilight_sprinkle> fire mods for cheaper stream
<RoflBot> lol
<ekips> agreed Roflbot...wait 6_9
<Sylandest> Well, you may not get paid, but we love to be here with you guys and see all the streams! :)
<Espeon> 06yeah when someone else use far-fetched examples you point it out
<NightSeas> 2What you’re saying is, if you can do say something, it’s okay to do the opposite of that as well
<XAX> Does the website even cost that much a month/year anyway?
<Angel_Umbreon> 13okay guys, seriously stfu now cuz it's getting you nowhere
<Vordox> So the ads are..for what exactly?
<Espeon> 06my sides are moving on their own
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Vordox, make sure you check to see if something loaded a win32 file onto your computer, that's very serious virus you should get removed as soon as possible
<Nick> guys guys guys
<Angel_Umbreon> 13please
<icybeauti> dat bass canon
<cow334> Sylandest: right we love them no matter what
<Narolas> Isn't love and hugs a currency ? ;(
<CCCP> byeiwillbebackinlike40minsorso
<Sylandest> cow334: exactly

<Espeon> 06that man has 1,1swag
<XAX> CCCP: We'llallseeyouthen:)
<FlareChaser> Vordox: Really, its a huge virus that could destroy everything!
<Skylands> 10etc.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Vordox, make sure you check to see if something loaded a win32 file onto your computer, that's very serious virus you should get removed as soon as possible
*Randomnerd just said out loud "Finally the moment has arrived for me to be one lucky bride"
<Wrek|Observing> 05FlareChaser stay out
<pony_1900> ok so another question. (Im just FULL of these) what is the difference between the different theaters here?
<NightSeas> 2[17:40] <NightSeas> Okay so, some people like Skylands and others don’t. We’re going to leave it at that.
<NightSeas> 2[17:40] <NightSeas> Anyone who wants to talk about talk about it and people who have a problem with that need to keep to themselves
<Vordox> Alright Kirz, I'll check now.
<icybeauti> When season 2 hits netflix, are they going to change Derpy?
<NightSeas> 2I'm not going to say it again
<Krakass> Good for you Randomnerd
<Drake> 04NightSeas
<Skylands> 10Some people like me and some people don't
<Skylands> 10Awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03what part of "shut up" didn you not understand NightSeas
<Drake> 04Who doesn't like SK-
<Biglaw> they better buckin' not
<Randomnerd> lol
<pony_1900> they better not
<Drake> 1,1:2,1::12::6::4::7::9::8:: GODDAMNIT! 8,1::9::7::4::6::12::2::1,1::
<FlareChaser> Oh..okay...
<Bobeh> icybeauti: God I hope not...
<CupcakeWarrior> Most likely
<Shizuka> 13pony_1900: the only difference between theaters is the chat rooms they connect to, which is a moot point during the week
<drfsupercenter> 03-n
<Randomnerd> This song is too catchy!
<icybeauti> Pray!!1
<Espeon> 06hang on I know what we need here
<Dashie_Dashie> This scene.. gets me every fucking time.
<Dashie_Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4JvFtqfjmQ
*Skylands rapes Drake in front of everyone in #Silverwings
<Krakass> It's a moo point
<CupcakeWarrior> FlareChaser: http://fadri.deviantart.com/art/MLP-FiM-ATHEWM-40-296361246
<Wrek|Observing> 05Shizuka: perhaps we should clarify that somewhere?
<Anotherguy> Lol
<Soital> 12-w-
<pony_1900> ah
*Angel_Umbreon gets a camera
<Wrek|Observing> 05hmm...
<Espeon> 06everyone, watch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0la5DBtOVNI 50 times
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's not rape if they want it too
<Drake> 04That wouldn't be rape though/.
<NightSeas> 2O_o
<drfsupercenter> 03:D
<Espeon> 06then 100 more
<FlareChaser> I think I'm gonna go now, I'm gonna play L4D2 single player...
<Espeon> 06THEN COME BACK
<icybeauti> Dashie_Dashie Same....
*Drake runs
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah exactly
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Espeon> 06Thanks
<Skylands> 10Drake
<Vordox> Still,I asked, why is there ads here if it's not..for nothing?
<Skylands> 10Oh, so you want it?
<Drake> 04But of course
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Must keep listening to fukkireta to fully purge it from my head.
<FlareChaser> CupcakeWarrior: Funny....
<CCCP> hmm
<RX-78-SweetieBot> MUST
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's because the software we USE to stream creates ads
<NightSeas> 2this place is looking like a random Pokemon Online server right now
<RX-78-SweetieBot> NOT
<XAX> Shizuka: I heard from another mod it also spreads the stress on the server out over the theaters from people connecting?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> STOP
<CCCP> Yes!!
<Krakass> Vordox, the add is from the company providing the stream
<CCCP> it worked
<Soital> 12I tried Pokemon Online
<Krakass> ad*
<Nick> or serebii chat
*Nick run
<Soital> 12EW
<Nick> s
<Shizuka> 13only during movie night and live episodes, it distributes chat load
<Drake> 04Espeon
<drfsupercenter> 03you know what's worse than Serebii chat
<Drake> 04that video is win
<drfsupercenter> 03is #PocketMonster
<drfsupercenter> 03s
<Vordox> Aha, so it's the STREAM maker that gets revenue...weird.
<icybeauti> @ValtheJean I only see ads when I'm accessing the site in school. I might be because they don't have ad block in school.
<Soital> 12nothing can be worse
<Shizuka> 13the stream service
<drfsupercenter> 03#PM is definitely worse
<CupcakeWarrior> And that is why you use ABP
<drfsupercenter> 03because half of #SPP is in #PM
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Soital> 12I don't think I want to try
<Espeon> 06In my ideal world that owuld be part of the first time startup of every internet browser in the world.
<Anotherguy> I don't
<Vordox> Aye. Weird. So it's a linked revenue, based on who uses the stream.
<Krakass> Origin of the phrase moo point. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLwYpSCrlHU
<Vordox> I find that very...erm...cheating?
<Vordox> Or illegal, even.
<icybeauti> Vordox I guess so.
<nickstr> I was in there for a while
<Shizuka> 13operating a connection with enough bandwidth to support the hundreds to thousands of people we get every week is obscenely expensive
<nickstr> even had voice
<drfsupercenter> 03I was too
<Espeon> 06damn you W key go climb a wall of... suggestively shaped objects
<Shizuka> 13that's why we outsource it to streaming services
<Drake> 04XD
<Vordox> Aha, so it's a minor evil.
<drfsupercenter> 03uso was a fricking half-op in there
<drfsupercenter> 03and then got bannd
<drfsupercenter> 03=e

<otakon> Xiodine: you'll be kicked man, don't do that
<Kandarihu> Okay. You see, I appreciate the irony of the actor complaining about there being too much blood in movies, and immediately dying in a bloody mess. I don't appreciate all the blood and gore, especially when he's spewing more blood than could possibly be in the average adult body.
<Polydunami> Whatever happened to the autokick?
<Randomnerd> Not the worst movie I've seen.
<otakon> Kandarihu: the gore is part of the show
*Nittany_Discord 11,01licks Xiodine

<junh1024-XD> To play this game, go to MapCrunch, select “hide location”, make sure you have all countries unselected, and click go. What this will
<junh1024-XD> do is drop you in a random part of the world. It’s as if you woke up on the side of a road in an unfamiliar country. The goal of the
<junh1024-XD> game is to find your way to an airport so you can return home.
<junh1024-XD> Bonus Hard Mode: No using outside sources, and that includes using google maps to figure out your location from signs or landmarks

<RoflBot> Thank god the real VA's didnt do this

<RaveBrony> That kid
<otakon> Gun_Dealer_Xephos: can you rent me a gun and may I buy a single bullet?
<SCOUT> TheRainbowDash: YOY WHATS SUP
<Gun_Dealer_Xephos> yes
<rdibp> poor kids in the audience. :'(
<RX-78-SweetieBot> It is amusing to see them try to mash half the first season into one show with only three characters
<owlicious> Live action G4 ponies have left me in despair!
<eris13> How long is this? Just curious.
<Ghosties> 04Would I kid a kidder?
<otakon> rdibp: they LIKE IT

<otakon> eris13: 30 minutes

<TheRainbowDash> Alister: Well, I'll stay for the laughs.

<twilight_sprinkle> SCOUT IS SPY
*Randomnerd walks downstairs and grabs anapple out of the fruit basket.
<nickstr> the radio station's processing should be able to take care of it though
<Gun_Dealer_Xephos> o

<LadyCanary> ...I dont wanna die, Ghosties ;____;
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I wish more of the regulars joined this room outside of weekends
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Dark92Enigma> @Ghosties. I thought that ''Also Sprach Zarathrustra'' reference would help
<Randomnerd> This is going to be a very bad season for NY Apples. It was too warm, so the trees weren't dormant long enough.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I am immune to kind-hearted requests
<Ghosties> 04;____;
<steelwing> hes cool
*Shizuka 13covers canary's eyes with wub~
<SCOUT> Shizuka: talk to my friend spy about desciesses
*twilight_sprinkle gets killed by SCOUT
<Mutterguy> guys, who's the new mod?
<drfsupercenter> 03the station manager was showing us the equalizer and like
<Ryanier128> seems legit
<Gun_Dealer_Xephos> *stabs scout*
<SavvySketch> I feel like I've seen this before... and yet I also feel that I'm not old enough to have caught this airing on TV
<nickstr> along with stereo generator
<otakon> ValtheJean: you bastard
<Vinyer> this teacher is late
<SCOUT> twilight_sprinkle: haha FOUND MY BALL
<steelwing> XD
*LadyCanary nuzzles Shizuka <3
<drfsupercenter> 03"If it goes into the red, don't think that makes it louder or have a farther range. It just makes you sound like rap"
<Shane377> wheres my scones sis?
<drfsupercenter> 03*crap
<Shizuka> 13wub wub
<Vinyer> very late -xx
<Kandarihu> Okay. Lister woke up 200 years in the future, after something (I forgot) stole Red Dwarf and hid it on one of many earthlike planetoids.
<Vinyer> x-x
<steelwing> :D
<klobb> yay, red dwarf's back on!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 comes with stabbing your soul and leaving it out to dry, only to turn it into a rather comfortable wool cloak
<Ghosties> 04I am appalled
<LadyCanary> B-but Ima canary, Val :(
<twilight_sprinkle> SCOUT: o_O
<Ryanier128> oh, stfu Rimmer
<Unnr> If you're in trouble he will save the day, hes brave and he's fearless come what may, without him the mission would go astray....
<otakon> ValtheJean: argh
<Ghosties> 04Val has less of a heart than I ._.
<Unnr> *coff*
<rdibp> im sad. somepony cheer me up
<Mutterguy> Kandarihu 2 millions years
<SCOUT> twilight_sprinkle: found my ball
<TheRainbowDash> Ghosties: That is low then...:D
*DeathStar hugs rdibp
<Ryanier128> eeyup
<Gun_Dealer_Xephos> *stabs scout again*
<twilight_sprinkle> SCOUT: lies.
<nickstr> you want to keep it a bit below that
<otakon> nasal intuition?
<rdibp> :)
<Gun_Dealer_Xephos> DEATHSTAR!
*DeathStar dances on rdibp s head
<Ryanier128> he's a cat
<Kandarihu> Mutterguy: I'm talking about since the last episode.
<rdibp> :S
*Hogia 14»»7 WinAmp 14«»7 SkrilleX - Needed Change [Feat. 12th Planet] 14«»7 01:56/04:02 [7¦¦¦¦¦¦¦5¦¦¦¦¦¦¦7] 14«»7 320 kbps n/a 14««
<nickstr> you get into overmodulation (overdeviation on FM) in that aspect
<Ryanier128> eeyup
<LadyCanary> XD
<otakon> lol
*OmegaMetroidBrony requires assistance
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<SCOUT> twilight_sprinkle: WAIT NO I DONT *BONK* kills you with a bat
<Mutterguy> oooh
<Hogia> 02so many fuzzy bits in this part
<otakon> LadyCanary: how are you today dear?
<drfsupercenter> 03he said keep it in the green, maybe touching yellow a tad
<Shizuka> 13was ist this acid trip i am watching
<DeathStar> Gun_Dealer_Xephos: hi why arnt you a royal guard
<drfsupercenter> 03but not in the rred
<drfsupercenter> 03*red
<Kandarihu> Remember, he woke up in deep sleep with long hair and fingernails.
<steelwing> :D
<Shizuka> 13is this aquabats?
<Dark92Enigma> Any one got my Also Sprach Zarathrustra joke
<nickstr> their processing should be similar to mine
<drfsupercenter> 03but you're saying the radio station should automatically normalize?
<Kitnighty> XD PACE
<Gun_Dealer_Xephos> i have my gun shop open
<otakon> Shizuka: it's Red Dwarf
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Kandarihu: it is intentionally not explained
<Kitnighty> ...*SPACE
<drfsupercenter> 03because if it's too *quiet*...
*twilight_sprinkle is dead agaib
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd have to manually boost it
<Ghosties> 04OH SHI-
<Mutterguy> Red dwarf Shizuka. it's a classic
<nickstr> my AM stereo station uses a five band compressor/limiter along with AGC
<otakon> lol
<RaveBrony> :D
<junh1024-XD> they can't normalize
<Calcos323> lol
<nickstr> you should
<LadyCanary> otakon: Really great :3 finished a research paper early. And you?
<Shane377> DeathStar Wheres my Scones SiS?
<junh1024-XD> but they can compress
<Dark92Enigma> IN SPAAAAAAAAACE
<nickstr> just listen to the air monitor if you have any doubts
<Ryanier128> wait, I think my dad's home. It's probably him
<RoflBot> http://browse.deviantart.com/?q=Cadence&order=14&offset=504#/d4xkk9p
<nickstr> actually they can
<rdibp> I rather prefer CARTOON my little pony friendship is magic. Is that specific enough?
<otakon> LadyCanary: okay, but the "trolling"
<Kandarihu> Okay.
<Ghosties> 04Val should show Max Headroom after this
<nickstr> that is what an AGC does
<DeathStar> Shane377: I ate them :)
<RoflBot> hehe
<Dark92Enigma> uses FACE FLASH to revive twilight_sprinkle
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<Shizuka> 13ja he-he-he should
<Shane377> GRRR sis
<otakon> Ghosties: if he has it
<nickstr> it automatically compensates for loud or soft passages in songs
<junh1024-XD> normalize requires future knowledge
<Ryanier128> eeyup
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Oh Ghosties, you know I never take requests :P
<Dark92Enigma> Face FLASH!
<Shizuka> 13i thi-thi-think that's a good idea
<otakon> lie mode

<SCOUT> HEY found my ball
*twilight_sprinkle is revived
<Shane377> Thats just mean DeathStar
<Alister> The Finale didn't have enoug Luna
<CupcakeWarrior> Max Headroom?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> rdibp: have you not learnt that the mods show what they want yet?
<Ryanier128> eeyup

<Unnr> CupcakeWarrior: Because who doesn't want a Luna inspired blackberry-jasmine ceylon blend tea?
<owlicious> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<RaveBrony> CupcakeWarrior: I thot it was only 13 Confirmed episodes O.o
<Reikim> CupcakeWarrior: Nope. 26. 13 by one studio, 13 by another.
<Alister> Aircrafter : Maybe if they didn't look like animu monsters
<nickstr> in fact I recommend trying that during the music to be sure you are not distorting
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh
<OmegaMetroidBrony> WHAT
<RaveBrony> Yay!!
<MahBoi777> NO Tom, you must know
<Aircrafter> Alister: Ya...Too uh...Shiney.

<Kandarihu> CupcakeWarrior: Season 3 is being split up between two studios. Each studio is doing 13 episodes.
<drfsupercenter> 03so while I COULD listen back, it would be really obnoxious
<CupcakeWarrior> Well if it is the last season, they will have an epic finale and the episode will end with them years later
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<mario_pony> damn i wish there was a site were i could copy someponies homework
<drfsupercenter> 03what I'll be listening to is the pre-delay
