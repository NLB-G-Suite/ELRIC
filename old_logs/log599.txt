<Silverstick> 1,11a reference to Scott reaching the brink of becoming yet another Evil Ex.

<CriticKitten> Careful, rain cloud.
<Nyst> It's weird that Canterlot would even have a rodeo. You'd think the stuck-up snobs would look down on such a rough activity.
<twilight_sprinkle> raincloud is deeeeaaaad!
<Flyboy> manly tears are double canon
<Azura> imao
<pony_3192> NO RAINCLOUD!
<mishiaia> XD
<Michael> :D
<Flyboy> poor rarity
<mrmaskpony> this is good
<twilight_sprinkle> the horror
<rdibp> rainbow dash isnt loyal .
*Dark92Enigma CONTINUITY TRIVIA: Dashie paid for it in the next episode
<mrmaskpony> chimmi cheeeryy
<JESmith71> And AJ was smashed
<Silverstick> 01,11...
<mishiaia> Dark92Enigma: lol
<mrmaskpony> run rainbow
<Michael> vendetta!
<pony_4321> MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<DJVinylScratch101> :D
<Silverstick> 01,11Why doesn't Rarity use her magic to make the thing go...?
<twilight_sprinkle> but yeah, they forgot a third of their friends lol...
<rdibp> bai everypony
<Nyst> Actually, how does a pony rodeo even work? Do the ponies ride other ponies? Ponies riding bulls?
<TheMonstaMuffin> clap clap clap*
<AJIsAwesome> Even though Applejack is the least developed character, she's my favorite. Why do people dislike an episode for an undeveloped character if it adds more character to them.
<JESmith71> Last Roundup/10
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate.
<DJVinylScratch101> :)
<nonody2> Derpy/10
<Michael> bye rdibp
<Flyboy> Silverstick: becuase rarity is STUPID PONEH!
<Dark92Enigma> DERPY/10
<Nyst> Silverstick: she needs all her magic just to keep herself sane.
<Michael> hai FillyFlam
<mrmaskpony> she cant use the amount of magic as twilight do
<Dark_Horst> Silverstick: her magic is fashion based. moving carts is not fashionable
<sub06905> Raincloud/10
<SuperBrony64> 11,02INTERMISSION TIEM
<Azura> @Silberstick fuck logic! :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverstick: she doesnt seem to be as powerful as twi
<noname> Silverstick: No energy? :s
<Schocke> Dark92Enigma : oh that cancer episode :/
<Ghosties> 04Because people like to joke that AJ is a background pony or some nonsense
<DJVinylScratch101> :)
<pony_3192> love this song
<Ghosties> 04But AJ is always best mane pony. Always.
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: I want a Rarity/Dash episode where Rarity still holds a grudge for that :D

<Nyst> AJ is pretty well developed: she just isn't that complex.
<Somebronyyayhg3> WARNING

<Ghosties> 04Is the B movie good as in "so bad it's good" or "good good?"
<MadSurge> Nyst: and that's why she's my fav 3rd pony :3
<Schocke> whats the b-movie?
<Dark92Enigma> WELL..........didn't miss DERPY this time.......DIS GONNA BE GOOD
<Silverstick> 01,11ALREADY, EVERYPONY. It is now Intermission. Go refill your drinks and reload on snacks. We'll return to continue Brony Movie Night in just a bit. STAY TUNED!
<Nyst> With AJ what you see is what you get. She's the element of honesty after all.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ghosties, it's just
<pony_9938> IS BOOLYWOOD OFC ITS GOOD

<CrimsonPhoenix> first time I bought a game twice
<mishiaia> OHH YEHAH
<MLP_Brovakiin> Is it the one that was on this morning
<Dark92Enigma> OK......everypony, a little question: Somepony told me AVGN reviewed Scott Pilgrim............IS THAT TRUE? and if so......can we stream such review? PLEASE :(
<mishiaia> :O
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: there are like 10 musical numbers that are at least 3 mins long. that plus all the unnecesary fight fillers and talk fillers and such
<Dark92Enigma> (if that's ok with you)
<CrimsonPhoenix> once was in sale with arkham asylum and all the expansion of arkham city
<mishiaia> twilight_sprinkle: its like 3 hours long :|
<Crono_brony> Dark92Enigma: So i herd you like scott pilgrim...
<CrimsonPhoenix> and the other as half-price in collector's edition
<Dark92Enigma> c
<Kandarihu> Technically, this isn't Bollywood. It's from another film industry in India called Kollywood.
<JESmith71> As long as the movie is, it could actually still be going (or at least at the pony episode) by the time I get back from my walk
<mishiaia> Crono_brony: Crono-trigger related name?
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, fight fillers and talk fillers?
<mishiaia> Kandarihu: XD

<CriticKitten> Post office kiss is worst kiss
<otakon> Dark_Horst: it's Fallout 3
<RoboGanjalf> We need a Conpiracy Keanu ponified
<PONY> Kandarihu, all the same, we are being brainwashed by this movie
<otakon> Dark_Horst: not Fallout or Fallout 2
<Dark_Horst> otakon: i know
<Vivix> Fallout graphics don't, but their PCB load is pretty heavy
<Noob709> Chitti: Also, what happened to the movie trivia for this movie?
<TheMonstaMuffin> lol
<otakon> well I've got plenty of memory
<Saturn> 08,01watching bollywood films makes me hard

<Saturn> 08,01wait
<Saturn> 08,01no, i said it wrong
<Michael> fallout is an awesome game, dont care for the graphics
<Vivix> should run fine if you got good ram
<Saturn> 08,01bollywood films are hard for me to watch
<Kandarihu> PONY, this movie isn't brainwashing.
<otakon> Saturn: goddamn you horndog
<Chitti> 01,11Trivia's limited for this movie.
<XylemTube> FEEL
<Flyboy> silly mr guy
<PONY> Bollywood has come long way from being Bollywood
<Dark_Horst> otakon: i run fallout 3 maxed on a 800 euro notebook. isnt even designed for gaming
<owloysius> Saturn: lol

<Crono_brony> SONG
<Agrold> :P
<diddutz> ad break
<Kandarihu> Okay, NOW we have a musical number.
<PONY> Kandarihu, it has Indian propaganda written all over it.
<Michael> then music?
<XylemTube> Big lippped alligator moment
<MarePlayUK> Wish You Were Here.jpeg
<Vivix> I started playing Fallout in 1999 I think. It's my favourite RPG game ever made, it ruined JRPG for me
<RoboGanjalf> suddenly: music video
<Noob709> Lucid dream there, guy.
<Saturn> 08,01okay, i think i've had about as much of this film as i can stand
<Saturn> 08,01time for work
<Tovler> indian guitars look just like ours
<Chitti> 01,11PONY: Please explain this to me...
<Saturn> 08,01see y'all
<Kandarihu> pony, what propaganda?
<owloysius> Saturn: but there's another 2 hours!
<TheMonstaMuffin> xD
<pony_9938> SAturn QQ more buy
<killerpony7733> Saturn: See you
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: yay im not the only one... bai
<RoboGanjalf> bye Saturn
<TheMonstaMuffin> This is to silly
<CriticKitten> Saturn, you'll miss the best parts! D:
<Michael> bye Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01CriticKitten: it's bollywood! there *are* no best parts!
<owloysius> it's scary that i might actually be accurate
<Purple`Prose> science love song is best song
<Dark_Horst> otby the way, if you ever wanna upgrade your oc, consider switching to geforce graphics card. they're just better^^
<Chitti> 01,11Huh...that's TWO songs where they reference Newton...
<Flyboy> how is this even a B movie?!?!?
<JESmith71> Saturn come back near the end. The movie's tone changes, and it gets serious later on.
<Saturn> 08,01it's all vapid and vacuous crap that plays like it's been put together by a 15 year old
<Kandarihu> Saturn, it gets amazingly awesome by the end.
<PONY> Chitti, it is obvious, first sign of Brainwashing is that you suddendly understand parts what they are saying without the subtitles
<Michael> dat dance
<CriticKitten> Saturn: You didn't see the airing last night did you? There are a LOT of best parts.
<xles> Saturn: The best part is watching hey ocean interviews instead.
<String_Shredder> needs more Indan Stallone
<pony_5771> my ears are bleeding
<Michael> ^^
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: for some reason everyone loves it
<Saturn> 08,01eh, i'm not a fan
<JESmith71> The effects in the final battle climax are really good
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: not me tho
<RoboGanjalf> Grapes in Honey > Peaches & Gravy
<Saturn> 08,01maybe i'll be back in it's third hour
<Saturn> 08,01*its
<Schocke> i just got earcancer
<Vivix> I play on buying a new gcard soon, probably nVidia, but not sure what brand
<PONY> Chitti, second is the random clips of nice stuff in between this scenes... like this one
<RoboGanjalf> suddenly: celtic rhytms?
<prince-dari> Pfft
<pony_9938> okok SAturn if you dont like it dont be a dick abaut it like ones say so gogo fella :)
<Tovler> Spoiler: she can sing like Fergie
<String_Shredder> Yo boys, I am sing song.
<prince-dari> This film is brilliant
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: its just terminator at that point
<Kandarihu> Saturn, so you're just going to come back in the middle of the movie?
<Chitti> 01,11Saturn: wow...that's incredibly skeptic. Just because it's not HOLLYWOOD doesn't mean it's not good. Some of the best work in history stems from Indy work.
<String_Shredder> Soup Song
<Ghosties> 04Chitti is right
<Flyboy> well, im gone
<Ghosties> 04Some really good stuff is indie work
<Vivix> Chitti: indeed, Hollywood kinda went stale in the 90s- sort of
<PONY> Chitti, then the hypnotizing dance
<Vivix> still great works being made, of course, but yeah
<pony_9938> Chitti word up :)
<Kandarihu> There ARE a lot of awesome parts. This is just the low point of the movie for those of us who aren't into Bollywood.
<PONY> Chitti, Bollywood has it's reputation
<prince-dari> I'm not a huge fan of the long songs, but this film is really awesome.
<Kandarihu> ...or Kollywood
<Saturn> 08,01Chitti: no, i just don't like bollywood movies. they remind me of how much i hate indian culture.
<Flyboy> i never thought i would say this but, THANK YOU BUFFER. THANK YOU SO MUCH
<owloysius> grapes in honey? that's fucking disgusting
<owloysius> too sweet
<RoboGanjalf> Kandarihu: What's Kollywood?
<pony_9938> SAturn wow go work bro .......
<Chitti> 01,11Now you sound straight up racist.
<pony_5771> Flyboy you lucky bastard
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, that sounds kinda racist
<Shooeie> So much ahte Saturn
<Vivix> Grapes are pretty sour though
<owloysius> no, he's part indian
<Shooeie> hate
<Michael> lol
<Kandarihu> RoboGanjalf, the Tamil counterpart to Bollywood.
<Lil_B> damn this location looks nice
<RoboGanjalf> oh, thanks
<Saturn> 08,01Chitti: it's from being exposed to a lot of it growing up
<PONY> Chitti, disliking a culture is not racist.
<Tovler> dis coversation. /me thinks twice before picking a black B movie
<Shooeie> Kinda is
<Tovler> yeah, kinda
<Ghosties> 04Bruce Campbell said it best: Hollywood blockbusters, so called "A" movies are actually B movies these days while true works of originality and inventive ideas come straight from indies
<Saturn> 08,01hey, i'm allowed to like and not like what i want to. it's not racist to have an opinion of a culture.
<pony_9938> i understand regular people act like that but not a MOD .......
*Flyboy dies on the inside
<Michael> ^^
<MadSurge> Ghosties: <3 indie
<PONY> wanting to change a culture because it's different is racist, simply disliking is not, unless you lack respect for it as well.
<TheMonstaMuffin> Saturn and Chitti, you two! Go to your rooms!
<Chitti> 01,11It is when you let that opinion stem into hate that revolves around anything related to the subject.
<MarePlayUK> Saturn: Obviously the most racist pony in the history of ponies
<pony_9938> Saturn if you dont like i why you sill here:)?
<Kandarihu> I agree with Saturn on this.
<Michael> stop please
<Saturn> 08,01okay, maybe hate was the wrong word. dislike is a better word
<Ghosties> 04And let's hold on for one second, I don't like the emo or hipster cultures...does that make me bad?
<Dark_Horst> ît only starts getting racist if you think of others being inferior du to... well, race
<Flyboy> if only death would come quickly
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai, good afternoon everyone
<Saturn> 08,01as in, i don't think it's wrong, or they shouldn't have a culture. it's just not to my personal taste.
<Michael> hai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Kandarihu> Are these the same subs that we saw last night? It's a different font, but the subs still reference "love cells"
<pony_9938> xD
<Noob709> Ghosties: And it still feels cheesy as a water bottle filled with dairy milk lactose!
<prince-dari> Anyway, back to the film
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh gosh this part
<Shooeie> Screwdriver
<PONY> Ghosties, according to the ignorance here... YES.
<MarePlayUK> Oh....my....celestia....its THIS film...
<RoboGanjalf> dat cop
<Chitti> 01,11Then why did you call this movie utter crap when it's merely up to your personal taste? there's a huge difference tehre.
<RoboGanjalf> is worst cop
<Purple`Prose> silly literal robot
<pony_9938> xD
<RoboGanjalf> Shitty
<MarePlayUK> Its about to get EPIC in here
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, it's very much a personal thing, because it reminds me of the things i don't like about my mother, who is indian. but i don't really want to go into that right now.
<owloysius> when i see JB, i want to break out my fluttershy, where fluttershy is a machete
<Shooeie> Playstation
<Michael> PS?
<PONY> Chitti, calling something utter crap IS an opinion
<Ghosties> 04Oh god, he's Pinkie Pie
<Purple`Prose> XD
<pony_5771> this is still lightyears better than In Search of the Titanic 'AKA' Tentacolino
<RoboGanjalf> U MAD?
<Chitti> 01,11He is. XD
<Michael> u mad?
<owloysius> but i don't. is that inappropriate?
<RoboGanjalf> Trollbot
<Dark_Horst> trollbot
<Dark_Horst> damn you, RoboGanjalf
<RoboGanjalf> haha!
<pony_9938> xD
<Michael> lmao
<nega-pikorar> What's that on your hand!? IT WAS PAIN!
<Shooeie> CUT
<Crono_brony> lol
<Purple`Prose> bad idea
<RoboGanjalf> You ARE the police, silly!
<Chitti> 01,11Trollbot is best bot
<Kandarihu> Saturn, fine. Go ahead and come back in the middle of the movie. You'll be wishing you hadn't when you come back and see just how wild this movie gets.
<MarePlayUK> Saturn: Honestly, this movie is worth sticking around for
<owloysius> hahahaha
<Flyboy> hell yeah
<Saturn> 08,01oh, alright, i'll stay for a while longer
<Shooeie> Troll
<Noob709> Super fighting Trollbot, Chitti!
<Saturn> 08,01it does look like it's picking up
<pinkyspice> o-o
<RoboGanjalf> I'm not into Bollywood either, but i find this movie surprisingly enjoyable. Despite it being 3 hours long.
<Shooeie> Hypocrite
<otakon> Saturn: why do they keep switching to english from time to time?
<prince-dari> You have to wait till the roboda song at least.
<prince-dari> XD
<otakon> Saturn: dude it gets crazy
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, be warned there's a lot of musical numbers
<MarePlayUK> Saturn: *Brohoof* Cheers for sorting out my BUCK table as well, sorry for the inconvienice =3
<CriticKitten> Roboda~
<CrimsonPhoenix> even though I personally love those parts :3
<Saturn> 08,01but i just want to be clear that i'm not anti-indian culture; i just don't personally like it
<Shooeie> Chorus is best
<Purple`Prose> awesome music
<Ghosties> 04Seriously, Chitti is absolutely the Indian Joe Pesci
<PONY> prince-dari: My Lords... is there gonna be a ROBODANNCE?
<Kandarihu> Saturn, understood.
<Chitti> 01,11Saturn: The story isn't anything innovative, but it is certainly interesting.
<prince-dari> Mebbe
<owloysius> otakon: animes use english phrases all the time, why does it surprise you. Besides, the country has two languages(i forget which country)
<RoboGanjalf> Copy that.
<Chitti> 01,11Ghosties: NO! He's the Indian Chuck Norris!
<otakon> Saturn: could you explain one scene when it comes up bc it makes no sense to us.
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: i understand that, i hate the slavic cultures i was raised with as well
<Chitti> 01,11or...he's both... :o
<otakon> owloysius: it's India IIRC
<otakon> goddamn buffer
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: i'll... try
<Ghosties> 04I don't see it...he's definitely Indian Joe Pesci *nods*
<Michael> science!
<CriticKitten> NOT CLEAR.

<Cataclysm> He just etch-a-sketch'd that shit up.
<owloysius> it's a pain understanding something that's only in a heart
<String_Shredder> daaaaaaaaayum
<CrimsonPhoenix> well duh :P
<owloysius> that's a good enough answer
<Michael> Kandarihu: thx

<RoboGanjalf> Prof. Evil
<Michael> gotta see it :D
<Kandarihu> Intel Inside
<PONY> Pentium :D
<Noob709> Ultracore? But that's outdated!
<otakon> yeah you can't tell that he's evil
<RoboGanjalf> How many cores does he have?
<otakon> ah the patent
<owloysius> Chitti: kim jong is not ill, he's dead

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Is that the robot version of Martin Lawrence?
<nega-pikorar> CCCP: Bye! Love you!
<Deadlypon3> XD
<Vivix> I'd still thank him
<turtlegod98> o shit
<Syn_Virtu> dang...
<Michael> wtf
<Chitti> 01,11Saturn, please clear this up if you can.
<Kamsko> LOL
<Vordox> Oh for fuck sake....
<nega-pikorar> Bollywood logic.
<Vivix> OH what the
<Cataclysm> lmao pwnt.
<Agrold> -_-
<TheMonstaMuffin> omg
<lowfn> bai CCCP
<Vordox> GO DIE
<Vordox> THANK YOU
<Saturn> 08,01oh right, this
<RoboGanjalf> ...
<Vordox> >.>
<pony_2038> this is so wrong
<Ghosties> 04HAHAHAHA
<Celes_Chere> naked>dead
<Ghosties> 04OH LAWDY
<Vordox> I didn't mean it...
<Deadlypon3> NO HE HASN"T
<Rain> that was her fault
<Vordox> Not litterally...
<Saturn> 08,01okay, so in india, they take reputation very seriously
<Tovler> I'm insensitive to other cultures so I find this bullshit and illogical.
<otakon> yh she just commited suicide bc she was naked in public
<turtlegod98> GOD DAMN IT, STUPID GIRL!
<Chitti> 01,11SB64: SO I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS HIS SKELETAL FORM LOOKS LIKE A BLACK GUY!
<Syn_Virtu> oh
<Deadlypon3> Saturn But really, KILLING YOURSELF
<Rikku> Quick interview the dead girl
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: so theyd rather die than being saved naked?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02SHAMEFURDISPWAY
<Saturn> 08,01there are things that are taboo, like for a woman to be seen naked
<Vivix> Chitti: it really does
<Meanwhile> Chitti: Oh no it totally does.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Chitti: :P
<Deadlypon3> Saturn I can understand that, but KILLING YOURSELF!
<Vordox> Saturn: So dead > Alive?
<Saturn> 08,01it's considered so shameful that they would be disowned by their families
<Celes_Chere> Chitti: Agreed
<Kandarihu> If only Chitti just let her die in the fire, she wouldn't have been humiliated.
<otakon> Saturn: the Japanese take rep seriously, but one wouldn't kill themselves over being pulled naked out of a burning building.
<PONY> Chitti, it looks indian imo
<Deadlypon3> Saturn ...EVEN IN A DISATSTER?!
<Ghosties> 04You uh...you can't exactly teach a machine culture
<otakon> It's stupid goddammit
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: Culture. Go figure.
<WRITEity> Saturn: so what you're saying is, in India, burning to death is preferable to being seen in the buff?
<Rain> her suicide?
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: You are so random! :D
<Saturn> 08,01Deadlypon3: you don't understand. she would have been ostracised from her community. she'd have to live as an outcast, basically.
<Deadlypon3> Saturn BUT SHE WAS IN A FIRE
<Vordox> May I show something SO wrong here, it's a historical image
<otakon> Saturn: so death or exile yeah ofc
<Saturn> 08,01WRITEity: basically, yes
<Rain> she didnt commit suicide. she ran out in trafic like a dumbass
<prince-dari> Meh, cultural difference.
<Ghosties> 04Deadlypon3, culture is different
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You can teach a machine how to look like Martin Lawrence :3
<WRITEity> Saturn: that's fucked up.
<Vordox> It most likely might mean a ban
<[Scootaloo]> DAT FIRE WAS A SPY
<Chitti> 01,11Think of it as complete and utter public humiliation for your entire life.
<Rikku> Impossibru
<RoboGanjalf> That was helluva culture shock...
<Vordox> But truth needs to come out =P
<prince-dari> It might seem strange to you, but it's not there.
<pony_2038> I blame the people taking pictures of her
<Ghosties> 04Just because it's fine here doesn't mean that it's okay in other cultures
<turtlegod98> It is the girls fault she's dead. THE END.
<Meanwhile> Exactly what dari said.
<otakon> Chitti: still stupid
<PONY> Nakedness, could be avoided by giving her a simple cloth before photos, this claim is invalid
<Chitti> 01,11It actually makes perfect sense to me.
<Saturn> 08,01not everywhere is like that in india, but that community looked like a very... old-world one
<CriticKitten> That's really sad, honestly.
<Saturn> 08,01a traditional community
<SuperBrony64> 11,02>old world
<Ghosties> 04Though
<SuperBrony64> 11,02>has robots
<Shooeie> 3rd world
<prince-dari> >film
<Vivix> that part of the community
<prince-dari> :P
<Chitti> 01,11It's a traditional culture, hence, they took it real seriously.
<otakon> Saturn: a stupid community "OH I MUST BURN TO DEATH BC I LACK A SHOE!
<Meanwhile> >Bollywood.
<Saturn> 08,01there are a lot of them in india, and they take religion, their culture, and their social status very seriously
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> no it don't or you would have get her a dress before saving her Chitti
<Vordox> Chitti: About this whole "nude = not going to live"
<Saturn> 08,01remember that in that kind of community, there is a cast system in place
<turtlegod98> sell it on eBaY
<Celes_Chere> dates are delicious
<Saturn> 08,01*caste
<otakon> argh stupidity!
<prince-dari> Meanwhile: INB4 manup.jpg later
<Celes_Chere> dates>raisins
<Cataclysm> I'm pretty sure all the fabric in the entire place was on fire anyway
<TrixieMuffins> Chitti you made a mistake , put all these people back in the burning building and start over
<WRITEity> On offense, but cultural differences isn't a good enough justification for ostracizing a person for being naked when their house caught fire.
<twilight_sprinkle> so he wants to give an allpowerful robot to the army so it can kill people? sounds smart
<WRITEity> *no offense
<Saturn> 08,01it may seem odd to them in the west, but it's perfectly reasonable for them
<Cataclysm> So unless she wanted to wear some burning drapes and die horribly, she didn't have much of a choice.
<Meanwhile> dari: Inb4 a thousand "Wat" lightbulb.
<otakon> so much buffer
<Saturn> 08,01*us in the west
<otakon> so much goddamn buffer
<pony1553> Sup
<Ghosties> 04Keep in mind that India is technically a democracy, too
<Ghosties> 04So Saturn could be very well right
<pony_2038> music vid time?
<Ghosties> 04It could have just been an old world community
<Kandarihu> I am quite aware of the caste system. I agree that it is completely wrong.
<WRITEity> Saturn: reasonable, or just normal/acceptable?
<Chitti> 01,11Montage, but not a music vid.
<therainbowvortex> will this movie have any english :P:P6_9
<Deadlypon3> Saturn I understand....But it's just so...insane to blame the rescueer
<Ghosties> 04Because most of India is very Western
<pony1553> :P
<turtlegod98> Oh WOW, Trying to make a robot feel emotions.
*CriticKitten nods.
<sergio_scriptor> therainbowvortex: it has smal bits of it :P
<Vivix> Movies almost always blame the wrong guy
<otakon> Saturn: so it would be preferable to them to DIE IN A FIRE then run out of the house naked? really? What's next? Not allowed to leave the house while it's collapsing around you without permission?
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: from a lifetime of growing up with that kind of crap, and having been there myself twice, i can say with a reasonable amount of certainty that i know what i'm talking about
<PONY> Saturn, WRITEity, everyone else; shut up about the naked issue; it was the PLOT that NEEDED it, no explanation needed
<Deadlypon3> Saturn NO YAH DOn"T :P!
<CriticKitten> It's still so sad. :(
<Michael> read all the books!!!
<pony1553> :|
<Ghosties> 04Then I would have to agree with you
<Purple`Prose> software hormones!
<otakon> so much buffer
<lowfn> Michael: BOOKS!
<[Scootaloo]> Hey twilight_sprinkle thats how you read books
<prince-dari> Software hormones
<RoboGanjalf> pony!
<Noob709> therainbowvortex: Only small bits of english muffin crumbs and all english subtitle translations.
<Tovler> it would have been preferable to drop her in the middle of nowhere that happened to have cloth
<Deadlypon3> Hey Poneh :P
<Chitti> 01,11I believe and completely understand, Saturn. It's called cultural differences, which is why we don't understand.
<Michael> moar books
<owloysius> horse!
<Meanwhile> I find it harder to understand why everyone is having difficulty understanding the whole "other culture" thing than the actual event.
<twilight_sprinkle> [Scootaloo]: yeah, im a robot too :3
<Michael> hai Poneh
<RoboGanjalf> Culture shock, that is all. Move along people.
<CriticKitten> o.o
<Schocke> dat lightning
<Meanwhile> Lightning rod.
<nega-pikorar> Random...
<WRITEity> Chitti: It's not about understanding. It's about valuing chastity over human life.
<derpy_pony> out of nowhere
<Chitti> 01,11He just got the Johnny 5 treatment.
<Shooeie> Lighting
<otakon> and then DEUS EX MACHINA!
<Ghosties> 04OH SHI
<otakon> LITERALLY!
<Deadlypon3> Now that's some cultural SHOCK
<Celes_Chere> Speaking of culture shock...
<Ghosties> 04He never asked for this, dammit!
<Deadlypon3> I did it first :3
<[Scootaloo]> ./)_< twilight_sprinkle
<Vivix> heheh
<RoboGanjalf> They can rebuild him
<therainbowvortex> dose this mean just gessing it will go rouge
<Saturn> 08,01aye; i don't agree with it, but it's there, and it happens. it's the same sort of basis for "mercy killings", like when a girl is in love with someone of the "wrong" caste, and her father kills her
<RoboGanjalf> They have the technology...
<MarePlayUK> Saturn is correct otakon, it's sad that the world can work like this for people but it does. It's all about how you are brought up and what you are brought up to believe. The ideaology that something else could exist isn't seen as possible to some people. They live and die by what they know and cannot see the world around them.
<String_Shredder> Ghosties: he wasn't prepared for this
<otakon> okay is anyone else getting constant buffers?
<derpy_pony> it needs love
<Noob709> Deadlypon3: >whitty oneliner
<Saturn> 08,01this *actually* happens, and it's horrifying
<Rikku> is it just me or is this movie very cliché
<sergio_scriptor> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Rikku: it is
<otakon> MarePlayUK: aye
<Meanwhile> Saturn: Jeez, yeah it is.
<twilight_sprinkle> Rikku: very, very cliche. this is just the beginning
<Chitti> 01,11Rikku: as I said, nothing innovative in it. But it's just so f*cking awesome.
<Vivix> Ligthning gave him feeels
<twilight_sprinkle> so yeah, hit your toaster with a lightning to make it experience emotion
<Rikku> well back to my dashie
<otakon> So, is everyone else getting constant lag?
<Michael> then emotions!!
<prince-dari> otakon: Nope
<Celes_Chere> OH SNAP
<RoboGanjalf> "You're not my real dad!"
<CriticKitten> He mad
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, enough of that. if anyone wants to continue discussion of this, we can do so elsewhere, but i think we should move on in here
<Chitti> 01,11Twilight_Sprinkle: Pretty much. XD
<Meanwhile> otakon no one else is ever lagging when you are.
<Tovler> I'm not and I have my torrent running
<otakon> prince-dari: i hate your superior british internet
<Meanwhile> otakon: ever.
<Vivix> No lag here, on my terrible 0.67mbps
<sergio_scriptor> :O
<turtlegod98> MY GOD.
<Rikku> Shit just got real
<derpy_pony> oh god. destroy it before it's too late!
<Meanwhile> otakon: not once has it ever happened.
<RoboGanjalf> Saturn: I concur
<SuperBrony64> 11,02So wait...did they kill the girl for being naked?
<Chitti> 01,11Saturn: agreed. No more talking of cultural differences.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, agreed
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: ...
<nega-pikorar> :'(
<CrimsonPhoenix> thanks for the info though
<prince-dari> Wut SB
<PONY> SuperBrony64: she killed herself
<Cataclysm> No, she just ran in front of a car.
<prince-dari> Weren't you watching?
<Vivix> haha
<Chitti> 01,11SB64: technically...she killed herself.
<Ghosties> 04And now after he walks through nature he becomes a human, awwwwwwwwwww
<otakon> Vivix: okay the FUCK then. are you sure it's .67? run a speedtest please and share it
<Meanwhile> otakon: It's just you. Forever. Always. Until the sun consumes the galaxy and the eternal darkness blankets the universe, only you have lag.
<Tovler> I have bullcrap NC internet and I'm not getting lag.
<WRITEity> SuperBrony64: she ran away in humiliation and was hit by a truck.
<Ghosties> 04Will he cry, too?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Oh
<Vordox> She went ahead and killed herself for being rescured to live another day
<WRITEity> SuperBrony64: like that scene in Mean Girls
<MarePlayUK> Chitti: How can you be here and in a film at the same time? You sure are amazing :3
<Celes_Chere> Suddenly babby
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I didn't know :/
<Ghosties> 04Does he cry real tears?
<Vivix> yeah I'll run a speedtest, last speedtest was 0.67
<Shooeie> This part...
<Michael> wtf
<otakon> Vivix: I'm usually get 2.00 mbps and goddammit I'm getting lag
<WRITEity> which reminds me, we should watch Mean Girls around here some time.
<Chitti> 01,11MarePlayUK: Swag. that's how.
<Vivix> it will be lower now that I'm streaming while taking it
<lowfn> AFK
<Kandarihu> The thing is, there's a difference between different cultures and a culture that divides people into classes and targets one side for oppression. Castes, Social Justice, these things are wrong.
<Vivix> we moved from central area to rural area, and internet is absolutely HORRIBLE
<TheMonstaMuffin> This is why she shouldent have cheated -.-
<Michael> inb4 doctor robot
<PONY> people and their babies... shooting them out like horrible guns of mass reproduction.
<WRITEity> Seriously, Mean Girls for A Movie!
<RustyMeat> hai guys
<Vivix> I can't watch yt over 240p, and have to buffer it before playing if 360p
<Kandarihu> Sorry for chiming in on this after it was agreed to drop it, but it took me too long to type it out, as usual.
<Dark92Chitty> DANCE DANCE ROBODA (still have it stuck in my head
<Dark92Chitty> )

<Saturn> 08,01lots of light
<Quick_Thinker> i like how 2.0 is still playing

<pony_2038> LMAO
<Kandarihu> Ghosties, maybe it would be better if you stop trying to rank each scene by it's awesomeness and just follow the story. So what if that chase scene isn't as awesome as the mosquito scene? It's awesome in it's own right.
<Thrackerzod> GUN
<pony_2038> best currency
<MarePlayUK> Best payment option right thur

<String_Shredder> I pay in gun all the time
<Vivix> Yeah-
<Ghosties> 04You were right, people hyped it up too much
<Chitti> 01,11twilight_Sprinkler: It was a wig. He could have easily been given the option to style it however he wanted to maintain that "Humanoid" aspect.
<Vordox> Ghosties: Hyping = Benefits with doubts
<Vivix> wait this was the climax?
<turtlegod98> cash and credit can kiss my ass! Chitti pays with gun!
<Noob709> Kamsko: It's over 8000. 9001 is not enough!
<Zawan> Vivix: no
<Michael> problem?
<Kamsko> WHAT?!?!
<[Scootaloo]> ouchies
<Vivix> Oh good
<otakon> and then SWAG bending
<Canadian_Brony> Vivix nowhere close
<Kamsko> Theres no way it can be right
<WRITEity> http://derpy.me/8LZki
<twilight_sprinkle> Chitti: ..how, how do you style hair like he did? thats not magnetism
<otakon> just watch
<Lil_B> is he building a speceship? I have no Idea what he is doing!
<Vivix> He just shook his head and it changed
<prince-dari> Ghosties: Pfft, we hyped it up because it's so ridiculously over the top, just wait.
<flutter_spin> NOT THE NAVY
<Vivix> It's well, this movie is anything but serious or well thought out
<Ryunosuke> Ghosties, the best part is still comming up
<Meanwhile> Dat rocket
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, metal filaments for hair, perhaps?
<Tovler> well… shit
<otakon> well that's that
<Cataclysm> The end.
<Saturn> 08,01fuck, india
<Vordox> prince-dari: Red Line Over the top?
<turtlegod98> not a bright idea to be driving in trucks with canisters on them, whilst the police (with guns) are on you.
<Michael> Michael bay approves
<otakon> Chitti has been stopped
<Saturn> 08,01you arm your coastguards well
<Vivix> It's like those TV action seriies where noothing makes sense, not even the plot
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: but what about the colors and such
<TheMonstaMuffin> Anyone know when its done?
<Unnr|Laptop> Never miss with india, the coast guard is HARDCORE
<Quick_Thinker> DUDNUDNDUND
<CrimsonPhoenix> I still love how unrealistic this movie is
<flutter_spin> lol that music
<RoboGanjalf> That's not him
<PONY> indian coast guard... watch out for rockets
<Saturn> 08,01why the hell would a coastguard need a missile?
<Canadian_Brony> TheMonstaMuffin later. Much later.
<otakon> TheMonstaMuffin: about another 30 minutes
<pony_9938> O:

<Quick_Thinker> WAHT A TWIST
<Saturn> 08,01SEPHIROTH!
<Meanwhile> Saturn: Robots?
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn terrorists.
<twilight_sprinkle> Chitti: also how fast they built an army of robots and the headquarters
<Unnr|Laptop> Saturn, illegal boat parking
<otakon> Cataclysm: always a bad sign
<Chitti> 01,11You ever see how a balloon interacts with your arm hair? that's static electricity. workable for a complex machine like Chitti
<TheMonstaMuffin> otakon Okay :/
<Shamroc> otakon...ya sure? i think its like another hour or so..
<twilight_sprinkle> Chitti: and found the materials and half a day
<otakon> Saturn: dude I thought this sounded like "One Winged Angel" too
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hi Shamroc

<Michael> hai Shamroc
<twilight_sprinkle> Chitti: that only works if theres a balloon above your head
<String_Shredder> head shot
<pikorar> Ew. Mac.
<Dark_Horst> out of control? BIG FUCKING SURPRISE
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn if I could drink, I would make that
<WRITEity> Chitti: to be fair, that doesn't explain the different color and length
<Chitti> 01,11Twilight: Did you forget that the company was attempting to build the army int he first place?
<Noob709> Why is DocBori dead?
<Quick_Thinker> CLONESSSSSSSSSSSSSs

<Vordox> DUDE
<XylemTube> fail
<otakon> oh bad idea
<Noob709> CR65536 is maximum!
<otakon> very VERY bad idea
<Canadian_Brony> should have just slit her throat then and there
<Saturn> 08,01by your command
<Chitti> 01,11Twilight: He built one. that one and he built another and so on. As Chitti explains. they built them based off of the Professor's technology, which was only missing Chittie's mind scheme
<flutter_spin> uh
<Meanwhile> HEADSMASH.
<Ryunosuke> splat
<Basenji> SPLAT! Like a watermellon....

<Basenji> umm 30~45min i think?
<Lil_B> Vordox that puzzles me too :&
<String_Shredder> Chittis. Chittis everywhere.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: The professor had pre-built most of them.
<turtlegod98> "A seven nation army can't hold me back"
<otakon> shana: thanks
<RustyMeat> still not there ghosties
<WRITEity> Ghosties: that's one chitti army
<RoboGanjalf> Kandarihu: EMPEROR
<Ghosties> 04If they all break out in song, I will acquiesce and say that it's the best thing ever
<pony_2038> nuke them from orbit it's the only way to be sure
<Michael> lol
<Meanwhile> This army is totally...*Puts on shades* Chitti.
<Cataclysm> We said it gets better. We meant it gets better.
<Canadian_Brony> Ghosties wait for it.
<Vordox> LAWL Ghosties :D
<flutter_spin> lol Ghosties
<PONY> those who advertised this cliche... we are still missing a good Chitti to fight all the others
<Ryunosuke> lol Ghosties
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: i alrdy said that those robots were completely different
<Unnr|Laptop> Saturn.. hmm
<Reikim> I like Chitty's jacket. Tis badass.
<pony46302> Nice place XD
<Sumica> 00,10Ghosties, later
<Shimmy> thats quite a chitti army
<turtlegod98> An army of swag bots
<otakon> so...100 Chitti's is like a standing army of 100,000 men?
<Vivix> they're all slighlty different height
<Celes_Chere> Chitti. Chitti. BANG BANG.
<[Scootaloo]> then she wants sex
<otakon> holy shit
<Michael> need imperial march
<Kamsko> use orbital friendship cannon
<CriticKitten> Ghosties: In that case, GOOD NEWS EVERYONE.
<Noob709> Actually, CRs. Chitti is no longer Chitti but instead Citti Reproduced. C.R.!
<RoboGanjalf> "Me... me... me..."
<RustyMeat> SEXY TIEM
<Zawan> Ghosties: that would be awesome
<Canadian_Brony> otakon best math
<Unnr|Laptop> candied rose petal ripped up and sprinkled in the beer, instead of the curry powder?
<otakon> Vivix: extra's but what are you gonna do?
<Vordox> "SO WOMEN NOW YOU GOT THE WHOLE WORLD YOU HAPPY NOW?! ""No"
<Vordox> O.O
<Vordox> WTF
<Vivix> hehehe
<Chitti> 01,11...what part of "He doubled up and used the company's already made robots" didn't you get? Twilight, the point is that you're doing whatever you can to discredit this film simply because YOU don't like it. I'm sure if we sat down and watched the Matrix movies I could spend hours pointing out plot holes. I'm ending this now.
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: 100 x 100 right?
<Noob709> So the only odd number is 1.
<Reikim> "In ALL ASPECTS."
<PONY> why the rest of the aint jealous
<Herostar-Discorded> all aspects? do you have a dick?
<twilight_sprinkle> Chitti: youre making it personal because you cant prove your point.
<Pikachu> luv this movie
<Canadian_Brony> otakon yeah . . . oh my gawd
<Vivix> The movie is pretty dumb, plot and cont wise, but it's still funny
<Ryunosuke> suddenly robot baby births
<otakon> is my math wrong?
<Chitti> 01,11I just proved my points.
<Cataclysm> Robosapiens.
<Unnr|Laptop> Go ahead my evil robot offspring!~
<PONY> Chitti, where is a good Chitti to fight the rest of them?
<Saturn> 08,01HERA!
<turtlegod98> robot sapiens
<WRITEity> Chitti: that's basicall what twilight_sprinkle does for every argument.
<Michael> evolution?
<Chitti> 01,11You keep rejecting them and replacing it with a different complaint
<Meanwhile> Chitti: Yeah, what WRITEity said. Don't waste your time.
<XylemTube> :O
<Kamsko> cum
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> oh god
<Saturn> 08,01but he can't do that! a human-cylon hybrid needs *love*!
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: The professor had a large stock of robots, and the earlier scene clearly showed Chitti was using those as his framework.
<flutter_spin> lol, baby
<twilight_sprinkle> Chitti: i can say the same thing, you dont want to accept that the movie is too ridiculous to be good for being awesome
<RustyMeat> CUM
<Lil_B> more human machine love? I get Flashbacks to Metropolis again >.<
<Ryunosuke> and she did
<Kamsko> cum cum cum
<XylemTube> she came
<Purple`Prose> Hail to the king baby
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<Ryunosuke> oh
<Herostar-Discorded> and she died
<turtlegod98> awkward.
<pony_2038> I really don't like this Chitti
<RoboGanjalf> And she came
<Cataclysm> Did he just call himself the king?
<PONY> cum cum cum cum
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Bad time
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat haircut
<TheMonstaMuffin> wtf
<flutter_spin> lol
<WRITEity> she didn't came\
<Unnr|Laptop> Chitty just tried to load the bruce_Campbell module, but it was corrupted
<Saturn> 08,01why
<Cataclysm> I do believe that confirms his status as Elvis.
<String_Shredder> she came?
<otakon> I was wrong
<Saturn> 08,01why, oh WHY
<prince-dari> twilight_sprinkle: He built robots with a robot factory
<prince-dari> So implausible
<Vivix> The movie is too ridiculous to be GOOD, but it's funny. I would never rate this with plot heavy movies that I already love
<otakon> math off the top of my head
<pikorar> Smart....
<PONY> always time for a haircut
<Saturn> 08,01is *this* the correct time for a haircut?
<Cataclysm> Elvis Terminator Sithlord indeed.
<Saturn> 08,01oooh
<Saturn> 08,01i see
<Ryunosuke> it is
<Saturn> 08,01he's disguising himself
<Ryunosuke> :)
<otakon> I'm a idiot, it's equal to a standing army of 10,000
<CriticKitten> Yup.
<Unnr|Laptop> Saturn, its always the correct time for a haircut
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn eeyup.
<otakon> *an
<pikorar> But they could sense that he's not one... Oh.
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr|Laptop: unless you're scott pilgrim?
<Noob709> >"Lets enjoy now itself." Chitti 2.0 learned Engrish!
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: well ok, the robot factory makes sense, silverscreen didnt mention it and i forgot
<otakon> STEALTH MISSION GO!
<RoboGanjalf> That Chitty is a bloody SPY!
<Reikim> otakon: You had that grammatically right the first time...
<WRITEity> Saturn: /hat
<PONY> cant a robot read bodyheat or something?
<flutter_spin> lol
<otakon> Noob709: it's just the translators not doing it right
<Reme-Not-Rome> what in celestia are we watching
<red_ony> can someone tell me the name of this movie? :)
<[Scootaloo]> its chitti chitti bang bang
<Chitti> 01,11I never said it wasn't rediculous. I'm saying that your nit-picking is countered by a lot of the explinations. If you want to say that it's outlandish and over-the-top, then I agree, but the "Plot holes" you're pointing out are actually covered in this movie and thus it's not as bad as you make it out to be.
<Unnr|Laptop> And suddenly monkeys
<CriticKitten> ....wait.
<WRITEity> PONY: he's using that little device to fake the body signature of a robot.
<Tovler> stock chimpanzee shounds
<red_ony> oh
<TheMonstaMuffin> lol this started as something cpmpletely else
<otakon> PONY: yeah but why bother? they don't switch to special vision modes unless they have to
<CriticKitten> He's replacing unit 42?
<Cataclysm> The most amazing thing ever. That's what we're watching.
<turtlegod98> No matter how many films their are saying not to build machines or they'll rebel against the creator. PEOPLE STILL DO IT! WTF?!
<Quick_Thinker> Reme-Not-Rome WE ARE WATCHING PURE 20% coolness
<flutter_spin> whoa
<Cataclysm> Commonly known as Einhiran.
<Herostar-Discorded> O_O
<String_Shredder> Unnr|Laptop: Hey hey, we're the Monkees
<Michael> wtf
<flutter_spin> ICE CREAM
<RoboGanjalf> lobster
<PONY> otakon, sorry WRITEity got it better.
<otakon> turtlegod98: it would help if we stop trying to kill them afterwards.
<CriticKitten> ....is that a coincidence or did the film just blow my mind with a Hitchhiker's referenece?
<CriticKitten> *reference
<WRITEity> Chitti: to TS, anything he doesn't immediately understand is a plot hole
<Tovler> This movies does a pretty decent attempt at covering plotholes.
<turtlegod98> ICE CREAM!
<Reikim> Endhiran. Apparently it's due to get BMC.
<Quick_Thinker> WE ALL SCREAM FOR ICE CREAM
<Meanwhile> WRITEity: Or personal.
<otakon> CriticKitten: coincedence i think.
<Herostar-Discorded> wait, SHE'S ALIVE?
<Quick_Thinker> NOW SCREAM :D
<Reme-Not-Rome> Quick_Thinker: uhh thanks
<turtlegod98> i know right
<Unnr|Laptop> String_Shredder: Nooo, you leave davy jones out of this
<Reikim> WRITEity: When was the last time we had this argument with him?
<Cypresswolf> Ain't no party like an Ice Cream Party
<Noob709> >Eat all the Ice Cream! So that no other CR may eat it!
<twilight_sprinkle> Chitti: the only actualy explanation is "science", which is a pretty cheap explanation. magnetic fields arent as easy to manipulate as you think
<CriticKitten> otakon: I think so too, but it's a HILARIOUS coincidence.
<RoboGanjalf> "Psst, it's me, Leclerc!"

<Tovler> He did that a butter knight? King of emos
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: they've got a robot that feels emotion so it having super powerful electro magnetic generators isn't aht much more far-fetched in comparison
<Kandarihu> People occasionally claim that anime makes no sense, even though it often relies on plot holes that are intentionally created from the beginning and then filled in later in the story.
<WRITEity> Reikim: can't remember.
<Vivix> Er skandinaver her
<turtlegod98> Better love story than twilight.
<Vordox> ALL DEM CHITTIS
<PONY> disturbance in the forc... grid
<Ghosties> 04And now two Chittis will fight?
<twilight_sprinkle> Chitti: they just said it was magnets. in matrix the point was that they lived in an artificial world with bendable rules
<Herostar-Discorded> oh no...
<Noob709> CR 42? Your human emotions are going off.
<prince-dari> twilight_sprinkle: If you're asking for the science behind the electro magnets, you might as well ask for the science behind the fact they have robots
<RoboGanjalf> POW! Haha!
<Reikim> OH NO!
<prince-dari> It's sci-fi for a reason
<WRITEity> Ghosties: more like Vasiri will try not to get murdered by Chitti
<prince-dari> Because it doesn't exist
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: which reminds me, being hit by lightning and then emotions?
<Cataclysm> Electromagnets totally exist...
<turtlegod98> March of the chitties.
<prince-dari> And isn't explainable in that sense.
<Jim> ded
<Herostar-Discorded> he forgets the problem
<owloysius> aww yeah
<Herostar-Discorded> xD
<Cataclysm> But they don't function in anywhere near the way he uses them.
<owloysius> the fun has been 100xed
<Vivix> twilight_sprinkle: it doesn't really matter when it's this kind of film.
<Vordox> LAWL
<Vordox> DAT SPY SKILLZ
<Cataclysm> So, he's a sithlord.
<owloysius> centupled
<Reikim> Late on the gun, there.
<flutter_spin> ITS MAGNETS!
<Chitti> 01,11Kandarihu: that's why a lot of people don't watch Avatar: The Last Airbender after the first season. All the plotholes and seemingly pointless episodes get filled in/used in the other 2 seasons.
<Vivix> I hear ya but, it's just not worth it on this film
<Ryunosuke> SHUT, EVERYTHING. DOWN.
<turtlegod98> lol
<Reikim> Ooooooh
<Jim> I was busy grabbin' food
<Kandarihu> We're getting up to, what I think is, the last musical number in the movie.
<pony_9938> xD
<Herostar-Discorded> Ohhh yeeeaaah
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: it's cliche, something about the "spark" of the creator or some such. Under normal circumstances it would just cause a short circuit really.
<Ryunosuke> uh oh
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, are you trying to argue physics in an over-the-top movie?
<otakon> Kandarihu: thank god
<Herostar-Discorded> MAGIC
<Reikim> > Shut down entire power grid to have sexy time
<Quick_Thinker> SONGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: well the original point of what i was saying, is that i cant say a movie is good because people/robots in it can do ''awesome'' things. i meant that imo thats doesnt mean its good
<Ryunosuke> here you go ghosties
<flutter_spin> I like her dress.
<Cataclysm> Musical number indeed.
<Lil_B> because it's not possible to just shut doen one small blcok along...
<turtlegod98> Oh god no
<flutter_spin> I can't believe I said that
<CrimsonPhoenix> please explain Scott Pilgrim then twilight_sprinkle
<WRITEity> otakon: thus why the same thing was used in the movie Short Circuit
<Herostar-Discorded> i have the strangest wing right now...
<Vivix> twilight_sprinkle: there I completely agree, this movie is funny but not good. In my opinion
<FUS_RO_yay> What is this?
<RoboGanjalf> Smooth
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: thats different, it had its own world and rules
<owloysius> hahahaha
<flutter_spin> Hey... Rarity
<PONY> Emotions.. Maybe. But I still don't get the physical attraction part, how does Chitti regonize his gender after all?
<Meanwhile> Can we stop debating cinema and go back to enjoying the movie?
<Reikim> All the sudden English in this movie...it is ridiculous.
<Pikachu> Good part/ bad (srry spoiled)
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: hell, you could just say it was a game
<otakon> WRITEity: eeyup and I elect that A movie next week
<Reikim> Meanwhile: Feel up to kicking TS?
<Noob709> CR command forgot that all CR loves Sana equally.
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, and you can't imply that in this movie?
<prince-dari> twilight_sprinkle: Well that's fair enough, you don't think it's awesome, I'll agree to disagree, because just about everyone else thinks it is. It's not awesome in the same way that someone might say 'Citizen Kane' is awesome, but it IS awesome in it's own right.
<CriticKitten> Chitti/Kandarihu: And that's why, if something's entertaining, I will pretty much utterly ignore the holes in it. The whole point of a film medium is immersion and enjoyment. :P
<[Scootaloo]> LETS WATCH SILENT HILL
<Dark92ChittyV2> NO PROPOSE on advancing to the plot, eh movie?..............GO ON
<Meanwhile> Reikim: Why would I kick teamspeak.
<Wrek> 05inb4 obtuse.
<Reikim> Meanwhile: I dunno, maybe because you're bored.
<Vivix> I think it's funny, but not awesome
<Sumica> 00,10Citizen cane sucks
<Vivix> I've never seen Citizen Kane-
<Meanwhile> Reikim: But I'm not bored, I'm watching the movie. :3
<Cataclysm> Have you seen the movie to the end?
<flutter_spin> that ring does not belong on a guy
<Canadian_Brony> <Ghosties> "If they all break out in song, I will acquiesce say that it's the best thing ever" here it comes
<Herostar-Discorded> ooooooooh sweet baby jeesus
<Cataclysm> By the end, you'll agree that it's awesome.
<Reikim> ERm
<CrimsonPhoenix> SONG TIME
<Tovler> Vertigo > Citizen Kane
<Chitti> 01,11What prince-dari said. It's not awesome because it's a good film. It's awesome because it's just straight up mindless entertainment that's a hell of a lot of fun.
<DrSteveSCARz> this is the loooongst movie
<Jim> now that was kinda scary
<Ryunosuke> This movie brings you ... Robot Lions..... ROBOT. LIONS!
<turtlegod98> 0_0
<Reikim> This movie
<Kamsko> sweeeet jesus
<Cataclysm> BAM SONG
<Shooeie> SONG
<TheMonstaMuffin> Oh no -.-
<Meanwhile> Ghosties: What was that about breaking into song?
<Vordox> LAAAAAAAAA
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> HERE IT COMES
<turtlegod98> I'm scared.
<Jim> Screen driver crashed for the first time on this laptop
<prince-dari> Here we go.
<flutter_spin> uh oh
<Reikim> Guys. Guys I'm terrified.
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: nono, thats not what i meant. i agree that the fights are awesome, but imo that doesnt make it a good movie, because i can write a similar script and just say "science"
<prince-dari> ROBOT LIONS
<CriticKitten> Thus, fine, there may be holes. On the other hand, I'm having way too much fun to give a fuck. Thus it did its job properly, it's a good movie in that respect :p
<RoboGanjalf> Robot lions
<pony_2038> I know, I'm scared too
<otakon> oh yeah this bit
<Lil_B> Sumica Citicen Kane just isn't a Movie for everyone...
<PONY> creepyness is to the max
<Cataclysm> Plus robolions.
<Shooeie> Song=Sex
<pony_9938> :D
<Celes_Chere> So does Chitti get to bang?
<Herostar-Discorded> i hope viagra... or what's his name... knowswhat he's doin g |:
<RustyMeat> robo lions
<flutter_spin> LOL
<otakon> yeah the biggest WTF has yet to come though
<Ghosties> 04They all have to be singing
<Reikim> Chitti-Chitti Bang-Bang?
<Kandarihu> The truth is, some stories just require a certain amount of willing suspension of disbelief. A good sci/fantasy story requires that. The Academy of Arts and Sciences seems to have very little of it.
<WRITEity> CriticKitten: I do that occasionally too, but generally I will acknowledge if something's a plot hole or the like. A lot of people seem to think that if there's one element that somebody dislikes about a movie, they must hate it or think it's awful.
<otakon> so get comfy
<Tovler> This song exudes power.
<Vivix> Will we ever watch Citizen Kane here? I've been meaning to see it for years
<Canadian_Brony> Ghosties is this the best thing ever now?
<Unnr|Laptop> This musical number reminds me of flash gordon...
<turtlegod98> What they make the actors/actresses were.
<Vordox> Ghosties: XD
<String_Shredder> Celes_Chere: Chitti Chitti bang bang
<Quick_Thinker> it will hit LUNA NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<TheMonstaMuffin> Crash
<Ryunosuke> Ghosties, they arent?
<Reikim> Ghosties: See, they all burst out singing. Admit it's the best thing ever.
<Purple`Prose> I for one welcome our Chitti Overlords
<Ghosties> 04Alright, now I'll aquiesce
<[Scootaloo]> its chitti chitti bang bang
<Karaoke> This movie makes no sense
<PONY> clones... clones everywhere
<Canadian_Brony> EPIC WIN!!!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Best part? :3
<Meanwhile> You just know they found these guys at an Elvis impersonators club.
<Chitti> 01,11twilight_Sprinkle: yes, just using "science" as a reason is a poor excuse, but this movie actually explains the science, which actually covers teh plot holes.
<otakon> SuperBrony64: not even cloes
<RustyMeat> not yet
<Noob709> Herostar: Viagra doesn't know jack about what it's doing.
<pinkyspice> is this movie a musical?
<flutter_spin> purple. She's Twilight now?
<Pikachu> DANCE DANCE DANCE :D
<owloysius> pinkyspice: close, it's bollywood
<Quick_Thinker> BUFFERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
<Canadian_Brony> pinkyspice essentailly, yeah
<Cataclysm> This movie's conclusion is a legally viable replacement for Viagra.
<pony_2038> Evilyn?
<[Scootaloo]> wait 24 hours O_o
<Noob709> Herostar: It's Ecstacy that know's it's action.
<RustyMeat> Yeah eat day hpney
<Dark_Horst> i think the song just porned slightly
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: suspension of disbelief of 100 is required to enjoy this movie, you only have it at 25.
<Herostar-Discorded> am i the only one who'd have the comon sense to, i don't know, THROW damn bucket of water on him?
<Reikim> Ooh, Chitti's gettin' his sexay on.
<Reme-Not-Rome> this is possibly the weierdest movie ive ever seen
<pinkyspice> wait, he a robot that loves that woman right?
<otakon> Reme-Not-Rome: eeyup
<Sumica> 00,10and yes this is a metaphor for sex
<Chitti> 01,11otakon: lawl, pretty much that.
<twilight_sprinkle> Chitti: i dont consider 'magnets' a sufficient explanation for a robot that can do the things chitti does
<Ryunosuke> so... much... swag
<otakon> pinkyspice: eeyup
<WRITEity> Seriously, people approaching this like it's 2001: A Space Oddysey in terms of its scientific accuracy.
<Reikim> Herostar-Discorded: Supposedly he's waterproof.
<Ghosties> 04Still, the misquito scene was COMPLETELY out of left field and I had no idea it would happen...I have to say it's a better part of the film for me even if it's not the *best* part
<Canadian_Brony> pinkyspice eeyup.
<flutter_spin> lol. Thank you Sumica.
<pikorar> pinkyspice: Perty much.
<turtlegod98> I still can't forget the part when that dumbass girl runs into the road and commits suicide.
<TheMonstaMuffin> This is so akward
<Ghosties> 04Actually, no
<Quick_Thinker> Reme-Not-Rome it gets even awesomer just be prepared
<Vivix> yeep
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<otakon> Ghosties: that was the TRUE BLAM! of this movie
<Ghosties> 04I just can't
<Ghosties> 04I can't say that this is better than the misquito scene
<Chitti> 01,11twilight_sprinkle: and yet it's a reasonable explination for the sh*t that Magneto of X-men can do?
<prince-dari> twilight_sprinkle: I don't think it's that kind of film where they have to explain, it's not the sort of film that really has to be plausible, and maybe you could write a similar script, if you can actually get it made into a film, it might be good
<flutter_spin> uhhhhhh
<Ghosties> 04That whole scene was absolute perfection
<twilight_sprinkle> Ghosties: the mosquito scene was a reference to a russian movie Day watch
<CriticKitten> WRITEity: Yep. If you think about it, this is why people say that they like films like Moulin Rouge. That film has its holes, but it does one thing right: it entertains them to the point where they don't care or don't think about the holes.
<otakon> Ghosties: just wait
<Kandarihu> This kitty of mine keep pawing at me. She wants my attention.
<Unnr|Laptop> did he just lick her blood?
<Ryunosuke> just wait ghosties
<flutter_spin> too high voice!
<Herostar-Discorded> Reikim that is bad.
<prince-dari> Ghosties: Still, just wait
<otakon> Kandarihu: pet her!
<WRITEity> Ghosties: save your 'best scene' title til you're done with the film.
<Reme-Not-Rome> i quess this is only recomeneded for people who smoke illegal stuff
<otakon> Kandarihu: give her love!
<Sumica> 00,10it realy was one of the most wtf moments Ghosties
<turtlegod98> uh...WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!
<twilight_sprinkle> Chitti: maybe not, ive never watched xmen
<pikorar> turtlegod98: It's dumbass on account of her becoming an outcast, and at the lowest tier of all humanity in her culture.
<otakon> hiya Sumica
<Chitti> 01,11ah.
<PONY> Chitti, due to the obvious propaganda, my brain no want's to accept this movie being an actual documentary as a fact... And now I am very afraid of India, wish death to it's opponents and hail their superiority.
<[Scootaloo]> Chitti: do you bang her
<Tovler> Two point Oh is my favorite scene so far.
<flutter_spin> turtlegod98: a very very odd film
<RoboGanjalf> ROBOT
<Michael> dem lions
<Vivix> Reme-Not-Rome: it's never an necessity
<Canadian_Brony> Ghosties sit tight.

<otakon> I'LL FORM THE HEAD!
<CriticKitten> 1000 lions.
<Meanwhile> That outfit makes him look like the Gold Zeo Ranger.
<Ghosties> 04Seriously
<otakon> he's equal to VOLTRON!
<Unnr|Laptop> Chitty secretly stole Ming the Merciless' wardrobe
<Herostar-Discorded> i bet snoop lion's there somewhere
<prince-dari> I still say just wait
<Vivix> If you need to do something to enjoy something it's not enjoyable in the first place
<prince-dari> Best and most WTF sequence upcoming
<Shooeie> STAR WARS
<flutter_spin> LOL
<Sumica> 00,10you missed the part where he said he made ajustments for that pinkyspice

<PONY> Chitti is the King of India, and this is his lifestory
<RoboGanjalf> FUCKIN LIGHSABER, MAN
<Purple`Prose> He truly is a Sith
<Kandarihu> Problem is though, she's one clingy cat. I petted her, and she still wants more
<Cataclysm> Elvis Terminator Sithlord.
<Shooeie> Darth Chitti
<Ghosties> 04Funny, yes. The lightsaber bit was funny
<Zawan> they did perfect the scene with yhe mosquitos
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Ghosties: i gotta say, i laughed my head off at that bit, i did not expect it at all
<Michael> the hell? star wars?
<otakon> GEORGE LUCAS IS GONNA SUE A BITCH
<pinkyspice> Sumica: wait, he can have children now?
<WRITEity> CriticKitten: eeyup. Personally, I dislike Moulin Rouge because it's just too much being thrown at me constantly, and I never get to sit and enjoy a scene or shot before it switches away to something else. But it certainly has tons of energy and passion in it, and I totally understand why folks like it.
<pony_2038> Mosquitoes needed a bigger role in this movie
<flutter_spin> I won't say no to robots... *cough*
<Michael> this is totally innacurate
<PONY> Chitti, I have already explained how this movie fits and qualifies for propaganda
<Dark92ChittyV2> I WON'T SAY NO TO MUSICALS
<red_ony> the book was better
<Sumica> 00,10yes, he told here that he was going to have robosapins
<pikorar> The only thing left over after eating are dirty dishes....
<Chitti> 01,11I guess I missed it...
<Reikim> "His stature is so tall it will hit the moon." I'm not the only one seeing that, am I.
<Chitti> 01,11WRITEity: is that how you feel about this movie as well?
<Ryunosuke> ROBOT. LIONS

<pony_2038> all the sana
<nonody2> dat copy paste
<CriticKitten> WRITEity: Aye. This film, for me, is so over the top, so absurd and so....well honestly, well thought out, that I don't even find myself bothering to look for problems in it.
<Chitti> 01,11PONY: I don't see it. At all.
<Herostar-Discorded> Reikim no you're not
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: idk, i usually prefer an explanation when beings are This op. my original point was just awesome fights =/= good movie
<Michael> copy pasta
<Ghosties> 04She reminds me a bit of Mila Kunis
<flutter_spin> lol
<otakon> PONY: she's playing along
<CriticKitten> WRITEity: Which in my opinion means the film did it right.
<pony_2038> he should have made robots of her
<red_ony> must be made by apple
<otakon> Ghosties: it's the eyes I think
<pony_2038> in the first place
<Sumica> 00,10keep watching pinkyspice

<Ryunosuke> here it comes
<Reikim> This...might be a problem.

<Meanwhile> Reikim: http://i.imgur.com/Qz0kC.jpg
<Vivix> I haven't bowled in over 10 years! Yaha!
<Kandarihu> But come to think of it, that's a bad idea, since I can't even have the time to play the games anyway.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: thats a good pic of you mate
<red_ony> flutter_spin: beats a spoon
<flutter_spin> ^^
<Chitti> 01,11flutter_spin: There's a national and international bowling league. I actually had the option to go to Australia for mine...
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: Because you haven't used that joke a hundred times already.
<Canadian_Brony> Vivix I can't remember the last time I bowled. Years and years ago . . .
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: nope. only 99 times
<Jmo4267> AUSTRALIA!
<Pikachu> i luv my little pony ^_^
<Vivix> mine was via school, and I kept stepping over
<turtlegod98> same
<flutter_spin> I mean in Equestria. Seems kind of odd.
<Pikachu> soo what i likey
<Chitti> 01,11Local bowling leagues could exist in Ponyville...
<sub06905> Scootaloo is best CMC
<Vivix> plus not all ponies have cutiemark in their jobs
<Chitti> 01,11<sub06905> Scootaloo is best CMC
<Chitti> 01,11nope.
<sub06905> yup
<Chitti> 01,11Sweetie Belle is best CMC
<Pikachu> PARTEYEH
<Kamsko> going to sleep goodnight everypony
<Vivix> like how bonbon does oddjobs and that berry cherry works with trash-
<Dark92ChittyV2> lol Pinkie
<owlicious> cupcakes!
<flutter_spin> See. Parties are something.
<RoboGanjalf> dat hat
<Pikachu> night kamsko
<turtlegod98> no it wont!
<pony_2038> I agree with Chitti, SB is best CMC
<Dark92ChittyV2> HOW CAN YOU SAY NO
<Vivix> I love feathers
<Canadian_Brony> Chitti I call my little sis "Sweetie Belle".
<howdyx> YAY :)
<Kandarihu> Yup. Scootaloo was just flying
<turtlegod98> no!
<sub06905> dat voice crack
<pony_2038> love her voice cracks
<Chitti> 01,11Canadian_Brony: Does she know the reference?
<Pikachu> Is this the cutie pox?
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello everypony.
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> I love how her mouth hurts
<Vivix> instead of just--boink boink
<Chitti> 01,11The voice cracks is a clever personality trait of Sweetie Belle
<flutter_spin> ow ow ow
<turtlegod98> ouch.
<RoboGanjalf> ouch
<Pikachu> i watched it when i lost connectoin XD
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Try to keep in mind that cutie marks aren't like pieces of equipment. They're visual representations of the one activity/hobby/whatever that you absolutely love and that you have considerable skill at. They represent your passion.
<pony_2038> zecora the dentist?
<Reikim> Chitti: Sweetie Belle also has best singing voice.
<Vivix> yeahm what Reikim said
<Unnr|Laptop> Meanwhile: if you haven't beaten a joke into the ground, you haven't used it often enough... >_>
<Vivix> Notice with BG ponies and some of the mane six how their cutiemark dont represent their job, but their passion
<flutter_spin> I know I know. But bowling?
<Vivix> he loooves bowling
<PONY> suspicious bloom is suspicioos
<turtlegod98> well...I'm gona stay as a blank flank for the rest of my life... :(
<Vivix> he'll probably be a desk clerk
<Reikim> What the CMC get wrong every single time is that a cutie mark is not earned or gotten. It is found; it is discovered based on the pony. The pony makes the cutie mark; not the other way around.
<PONY> dentist of a century
*sub06905 still prefers Scootaloo
<Chitti> 01,11Vivix: That's the same with Rarity. her cutie mark is her passion for gems, but her job is being a fashionista
<Vivix> yeaah
<RoboGanjalf> Question: What does Zecora's cutie mark represents?
<Unnr|Laptop> So you are saying, Reikim is that there is no pony
<turtlegod98> lol
<Pikachu> when will the little poines get there cutie marks XD
<otakon> Reikim: when they realize that they'll get their marks.
<Chitti> 01,11Zecora's represents her mixtures and the ability to combine nature with the needs of life. :)
<Schocke> i guess season 9
<Unnr|Laptop> Pikachu: when scootaloo gets an episode
<flutter_spin> Just seems a little odd to have a 'bowling' cutie mark. Lightning bolt, hammer, or giant star....
<Reikim> Chitti: Actually...Rarity's mark represents her ability to find beauty that is hidden. Art thing.
<Unnr|Laptop> so never
<Canadian_Brony> Chitti she did, but she asked me a month ago why. I told her she reminded me alot of Sweetie Belle: as annoying as she can be at times, I'll always love her as my sister. She even called me her BBBFF yesterday.
<turtlegod98> alchemy FTW!
<RoboGanjalf> ooh, symbolism
<PONY> can somepony explain Zecora's Cutie Mark and why Donkeys, dragons nor cows don't have one
<Pikachu> oh XD
<Pikachu> this episode she dose then it gos XD
<Reikim> PONY: See Chitti's comments.
<Chitti> 01,11PONY: see my above comment on Zecora's cutie mark.
<Vivix> It's a pony thing, bascially. Zebras seem to have a variation on it
<Canadian_Brony> Patience is a virtue. A lesson that cannot be taught.
<turtlegod98> you go, you go
<Herostar-Discorded> amethyst a flower...
<FUS_RO_yay> Hello everyone.
<PONY> Chitti, yes, but wtf is it?
<Canadian_Brony> Herostar-Discorded IKR? It's a jewel.
<turtlegod98> hi
<Canadian_Brony> hi FUS_RO_yay
<Chitti> 01,11A Zebra's cutie mark is more obscure, that way Zebras still have to figure it out for themselves even after they get it.
<otakon> hiya turtlegod98
<Kandarihu> Evidently, only ponies get cutie marks.
<Schocke> hiho FUS_RO_yay :)
<Vivix> ah yeah- that would make sense
<otakon> it's the ONE RING!
<Shooeie> Tron Disk?
<Chitti> 01,11*sigh*
<Canadian_Brony> Chitti LoLz, that makes alot of sense
*Pikachu hugs pikachu
<otakon> THROW HER IN MOUNT DOOM!
<PONY> Chitti, riddles, riddles everywhere
<owlicious> wait, they never get their cutie marks
<otakon> dat Twisp
*Bronysith throws otakon in mount doom
<otakon> no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<owlicious> am i drunk right now?
<turtlegod98> I'm saying hi to FUS_RO_yay
<Bronysith> otakon: she can simply walk into mordor
<Reikim> Rarity's passion is not gems...it is beauty. Thus her job as fashionista, and abilities when it comes to finding gems. She is attracted to beauty, and she has great skill at drawing out beauty.
<otakon> THE PRECIOUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<Chitti> 01,11A Zebra's cutie mark is that of a sun, but the swirling center is that of mixing potions. .
<Vivix> Zebra's have a variation on cutie marks, as far as we can tell by zecora
<Spectrum_Rush> Chitti: link the zecora card
<owlicious> the cutie mark crusaders never get their cutie marks
<Agrold> coming from a pony with a tiara as a cutiemark...:P
<Vivix> Reikim: notice how she is obsessed with incorporating gems though
<Herostar-Discorded> and yours is being a snot, are you really one to talk, tiara?
<sub06905> amethyst flower ----> http://img4-2.sunset.timeinc.net/i/2010/07/amethyst-flower-0710-l.jpg?400:400
*Schocke hugs Pikachu (cuase hugging yourself is sad)
<Vivix> but yeah- her passion is beauty
<Chitti> 01,11Zecora's cutie mark, I mean
<Pikachu> lol
<Canadian_Brony> sub06905 oh, I thought it was a gem.
<Pikachu> it my plush
<Vivix> Oh, hey yeah! I can see that now-
<PONY> Chitti, okay, why donkeys don't have one?
<turtlegod98> Why cant humans do that?!
<Reikim> Vivix: Personal style. Artistic flair and all that. And not everything incorporates gems; her true "art pieces" barely use any, i.e. the Gala dresses.
<Thrackerzod> hello everyone
<PONY> Chitti, (riddly or not)
<otakon> Bronysith: http://images.sodahead.com/polls/001470501/37336280_mordor_xlarge.png

<Herostar-Discorded> Chitti is one of our mods. prepare for awesomeness
<Dark92ChittyV2> TITLE DROP
<flutter_spin> dat trolling
<Chitti> 01,11Zecora's cutie mark is that of a sun, but the swirling center is that of mixing potions. It represents her mixtures and the ability to combine nature with the needs of life. There.
<Reikim> Vivix: Rarity takes inspiration where she finds it.
<FUS_RO_yay> Loopty Hooping. Seems Legit.
<Bronysith> otakon: nope
<Canadian_Brony> otakon LoLz
<otakon> Bronysith: what nope?
<Jmo4267> Ohai Herostar-Discorded
<Vivix> truee-
<Herostar-Discorded> Jmo, good to see yall
<Bronysith> otakon: nope, no one simply walks in there
<otakon> Chitti: nice analyzation
<ancientblood> whos streaming?
<Dark92ChittyV2> OWNED
<otakon> Bronysith: go and try it thien
<SweetieBell> hai friends
<otakon> ancientblood: it's SuperBrony64 I think
<Vivix> Reikim I think that's right, but it's related to gems in how she found it and use it at times. Though it's not as narrow as that
<flutter_spin> showoff.
<RoboGanjalf> inb4 http://i1204.photobucket.com/albums/bb409/bitchpleasefuckit/The%20Main%20Bitch/hoopla.gif
<otakon> hello SweetieBell have you read the rules?
<Canadian_Brony> hi SweetieBell
<Spectrum_Rush> Chitti: might wanna keep that on a hotkey
<Bronysith> otakon: okay "Walks outside, walks into mordor simply" I brought back some random swag that gollum gave me
*Bronysith gives otakon a doughnut
<Vivix> So cutiemakrs are just an indication- so you're not forced by the Celestia tyranny to work within your cutiemark etc. like some fics
<flutter_spin> "advanced"
<Canadian_Brony> RoboGanjalf relevant
<otakon> ooooh, doughnut
<RoboGanjalf> HOOPLA!
<Reikim> ...That moment when you suddenly realize how deeply you've been considering the psychological. philosophical implications of cutie mark mechanics.
<sub06905> oh right there was a background Filly Derpy in this episode :$
<RoboGanjalf> HOOPLA!
<FUS_RO_yay> HOOPLA>
<Herostar-Discorded> HOOPTICOPTER!
<Agrold> better at flying than scootaloo...
*otakon noms upon Mordor Doughnut
<Reikim> *psychological and philosophical
<flutter_spin> weeeeee
<red_ony> ^to the moon!!!
<Dark92ChittyV2> Welcome, Sweetie Belle......have you read the rules?
<RoboGanjalf> HOOP-*brick'd*
<Herostar-Discorded> lolwut?
<Braviary> Ooh, ponies are on!
<turtlegod98> Sounds like alot of HOOPLA!
<Vivix> And Chitti I never saw what Zecora's mark was until you said it now
<Dark92ChittyV2> WHAT CHOPPA?
<owlicious> FUN FACT: applebloom was able to fly before scootaloo
<otakon> and TAKE OFF
<howdyx> earth pony flyyyyyyyyyyyy
<otakon> owlicious: oh God
<Braviary> The mark has been doubled!
<howdyx> sup everypony
<turtlegod98> sounds like alot of HOOPLA!
<RoboGanjalf> owlicious: oh, snap!
<otakon> Dark92ChittyV2: Tony Tony Choppa
<Vivix> I love Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon
<flutter_spin> This poses the question. Is there a pony with two cutie marks?
*Dark92ChittyV2 throws a brick to turtlegod98
<Reikim> Vivix: If it is a true cutie mark then you should not need to be forced to work within it. Cutie marks represent your passion; you're going to WANT to work within it.
<Chitti> 01,11Vivix: exactly. You discover your passion, and then find a job that has that passion as a part of your job. For example, a bowling cutie mark can lead to somepony actually OWNING a bowling alley.
<Herostar-Discorded> it's possible
<Canadian_Brony> Says the one with a totally useless mark
<otakon> flutter_spin: not known but my guess is no
<Vivix> yeah- totally. Much like us I figure
<FUS_RO_yay> Shes a Clown in a circus.
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Unknown. Probably no.
<owlicious> she's a witch, burn her
<PONY> Chitti, or maybe it's a tattoo, which would just simply make it a Zebra tradition to tattoo their speciality after discovering it, instead of actually getting a magical one like ponies *Conspiracy Keanu*
<flutter_spin> Be a fun episode to impose upon
<Herostar-Discorded> sweet jesus
<turtlegod98> Sounds like alot hoopla to have two cutie marks.
<Canadian_Brony> I'm still trying to figure out what my cutie mark should be.
<Reikim> Canadian_Brony: A maple leaf.
<Crono_brony> mine's a pixelated cake.
<Chitti> 01,11PONY: considering African traditions, this could easily be how it works for Zebras.
<Dark92ChittyV2> Chitty and that pony from earlier wasn't implied to OWN the bowling alley?
<sub06905> dat sleeping RD
<red_ony> my cutie mark would be §§ :/
<Dark92ChittyV2> DAT RD
<turtlegod98> spongebob quotes ftw
<NullRadix> Unofficial rule of canon: Zebra "cutie marks" have not been explained, thus there is no canon. Have fun speculating though!
<FUS_RO_yay> Canadian_Brony: A canadian flag?
<Chitti> 01,11Rainbow Dash: Not giving a sh*t
<flutter_spin> O.o
<nonody2> dat mane
<otakon> SPike loves Rarity for her mane
<Vivix> Dark92ChittyV2: wasn't the pony with bowling cutiemark a foal?
<RoboGanjalf> Spike's confirmed for hair fetishist
<Bronysith> SPIKE has a mane fetish
<otakon> there I said it
<Braviary> I like pie.
<turtlegod98> MONTAGE!
<otakon> INCOMING PIE!
<PONY> Chitti, exactly, and it would also make my question regarding donkeys and it's complexity irrelevant
<Dark92ChittyV2> Sleeping RD........no way that's gonna be a meme
<owlicious> nobody invited spitfire
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim FUS_RO_yay being a nationallity isn't a special talent. Besides, I somethimes go by the name of Lunar_B rony
<Reikim> otakon: Nonono, as seen in "A Dog and Pony Show" he's obsessed with her jewels.
<otakon> WHere's Soarin'?
<Olib> hi
<Reikim> Canadian_Brony: Twas a joke.
<Dark92ChittyV2> Vivix Point taken.
<otakon> there was pie but no Soarin...
<Dark92ChittyV2> EEEEEEYUP
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim wasn't very funny
<turtlegod98> How they suddenly go to the table for pie
<noname> noep
<Dark92ChittyV2> NOPE

<FUS_RO_yay> Canadian_Brony: dunno, i could never be a canadian. a steryotipic one anyway.

<flutter_spin> ugh. Couldn't get through Bubbles fanfic. A little too grimdark
<Vivix> AJ is so cute without her hat
<otakon> she's unstoppable!
<Chitti> 01,11Vivix: agreed. I wish we'd see her without it more often.
<twilight_sprinkle> flutter_spin: still, if its a story ho derpy got her cutie mark, then she mustve survived
<Herostar-Discorded> dat hidden joke
<Reikim> Shooeie: Supposedly Derpy is just bubbly. That no matter what happens, she'll always face life with a bubbly spirit. Or something.
<Canadian_Brony> It was night a second ago. Now it is day.
<PONY> dat music
<Dark92ChittyV2> YOU kinda do.
<Chitti> 01,11The trots

<twilight_sprinkle> shut up spike
<twilight_sprinkle> shut up elmo
<PONY> kick
<Canadian_Brony> Spike is new meg
<flutter_spin> I'd like to theorize that ponies are happy and joyful. They would never do what happened in that fanfic
<Thrackerzod> AIDS
<Vivix> I think multiple cutiemarks is either super rare or impossible- but multiple talents? Probably not too uncommon
<turtlegod98> AIDS
<Dark92ChittyV2> NO CURE????? (Dramatic Twi)
<Herostar-Discorded> FLEUR DE LIS!
<Agrold> She's speaking in fancy!:o
<Canadian_Brony> dat Fanceh

<RoboGanjalf> Fancy - the official language of Fance

<twilight_sprinkle> Applebloom would win All the events at the olympics
<Shooeie> Fancy
<Reikim> Whelp, I now know to stay away from "Bubbles". Forever.
<Canadian_Brony> I flunked french!
<PONY> Vivix, I believe Cutiemark simply represents your best talent
<otakon> RoboGanjalf: Prance
<turtlegod98> fancy is spoken in seven nations
<Thrackerzod> I wonder in french its in english
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim same
<Dark92ChittyV2> IN FANCY?????? no way that's gonna be a meme
<owlicious> ze cora
<Vivix> yeaah, that's a good way to put it PONY
<Chitti> 01,11Vivix: multiple talents like Fluttershy being able to sew while her main talent is her way with animales?
<Chitti> 01,11animals*

<Herostar-Discorded> FLEUR DE LIS! the sign of the saints! -grabs his phone- gat, we got a problem!

<RoboGanjalf> dat pony venus
<Vivix> Fluttershy is apparently pretty good at sewing too- like really good
<FUS_RO_yay> Bon-Bon
<flutter_spin> yeah Reikim. They posted it on EQD and everyone was like "this is a little too dark"
<RoboGanjalf> or aphrodite
<Canadian_Brony> sculpting would be a nice talent
<otakon> and then she must CREATE!
<PONY> anypony know what was the fancy language in French translation??

<JESmith71> Once again nice job Spike
<otakon> Seriously, is it me or do the Ponyville residents panic WAY WAY too easily?
<Vivix> They're pretty skittish
<Olib> is it ok if i can make a flim on u tube
<PONY> CrimsonPhoenix, wasn't that french? what did she speak/spoke as a second language in French translation?
<Vivix> it makes them extra cute, it might just be a pony trait in general?
<Jim> Her Spider sense is a tingeling
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: have you seen that granular bag video?
<Chitti> 01,11otakon: a trait of ponies/horses as a species. They are startled and frightened easily.
<otakon> Zebra sense a-tinglin'
<Canadian_Brony> otakon dramatics are funny tho
<Reikim> otakon: Actually, this is supposedly IRL horse behaviour...first reaction to danger: PANIC RUN
<CrimsonPhoenix> PONY it is french
<CrimsonPhoenix> She said exactly
<otakon> hmm good point
<Vivix> yeah-
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: the one with the mechanical arm holdign stuff
<CrimsonPhoenix> What is this? I'm talking French?
<Canadian_Brony> dem hazmats
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: um....what?
<RoboGanjalf> Hazmat ponies, yay!
<Reikim> ...Is it just me, or is the picture stretched?
<PONY> CrimsonPhoenix, what is her second language in French translation then? English
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: gimme a sec
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: no send me a pm
<Vivix> Prehensile tail
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim it's just you. Refresh

<Jim> Go Pinkie!
<owlicious> I ATE THEM
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'll need to take some research on that
<Chitti> 01,11AJ's suspicion of Zebra sense is understandable when you remember that AJ also accepts Pinkie Senses.
<Vivix> yeaah
<Reikim> ...Nope, the stream's still in widescreen. All the ponies are short and tubby.
<Herostar-Discorded> deer lord no :o

<Reikim> SuperBrony64: But what if...what if Pinkie was secretly part-Zebra...thus explaining Pinkie/Zebra sense? :P
<Dark92ChittyV2> and i'M NOT HER FINANCIAL ADVISOR
<Vivix> I for some reason thouht it was from this episode
<RoboGanjalf> dat hazmat pony
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Jim i know he is evil
<Pikachu> gross
<twilight_sprinkle> SuperBrony64: permission to post a youtube link explaining how pony hoofs might work?
<otakon> I wonder if somepony has a hazmat cutie mark?
<turtlegod98> EAT DAT PLANT!
<Pikachu> i wouldnt eat a plant
<Jim> Apleblooom
<owlicious> and now she will never get a cutie mark
<Canadian_Brony> the hazmat suit had a Nuclear symbol on the flank
<Pikachu> :P
<AJIsAwesome> DAT SQUEAK
<Vivix> some fanfics say earthponies hold with inate pony magic
<nonody2> I eat plenty of plants
<Vivix> I say--TV DID IT, and leave it obscure
<turtlegod98> I'd love to eat plants.
<Reikim> Vivix: Confirmed by Faust.
<JESmith71> But back to Derpy's cutie mark. Didn't you guys read Ditzy's Dismally Derpy Day? In that fic the explanation was that Derpy observed bubbles and dust and stuff as a filly and she used to it to learn how the air made them move, and how she could move the air.
<Vivix> Really? cool
<SuperBrony64> 11,02twilight_sprinkle: Err...no >>
<Vivix> I also like Fetlock grip
<flutter_spin> Vivix: Lauren once said that Earth ponies are magically attuned to nature
<Vivix> or hock grip- as is the front legs
<Herostar-Discorded> Zecora has the best smile i;ve seen <3
<twilight_sprinkle> SuperBrony64: :<<<
<otakon> ah the fetlocks
<Chitti> 01,11Vivix: They do in a way, as they are the only ponies that can sucessfully grow crops.
<Dark92ChittyV2> LIKE A BOSS
<otakon> UNSHORN FETLOCKS
<AJIsAwesome> Pikachu: Pikachu, what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be with Ash?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But on that note...
<Canadian_Brony> where did Zecora go?
<Vivix> yeah- but you know the inate magic lets them hold stuff like sticks with their hooves without the hock grip
<roronoa> hello everypony
<Pikachu> no i quit with him
<PONY> she disappeard
<Jim> hi roronoa
<otakon> hiya roronoa
<Canadian_Brony> hi roronoa
<SuperBrony64> 11,02We'll be doing YouTube requests today :)
<Vivix> which isn't too far fetched I figure
<Reikim> Chitti: Well, not the only ones...Earth Pony-tended fields just grow better, easily outgrowing fields tended by, say, a Unicorn.
<Chitti> 01,11Vivix: good thought.
<PONY> roronoa: you are a tad bit late
<Herostar-Discorded> applebloom can you write a letter to the most important pony there is? "Oh yeah, sure i can! no problem!"
<sub06905> yay requests :$

<Dark92ChittyV2> SuperBrony64: LIKE AVGN's REVIEW of Scott Pligrim?
<Dark92ChittyV2> WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-?
<Pikachu> pika ^_^
<RoboGanjalf> Canadian_Brony: If it would stop radiation, it should work against diseases as well
*Dark92ChittyV2 face-books
<Jim> dat Voice crack <3
<Chitti> 01,11Reikim: which is why in the olden times, Earth Ponies were the main source of food for Unicorns and Pegasi.
<Spectrum_Rush> SuperBrony64: oh you have no idea what you have unleashed
<DrSteveSCARz> awww its over :(
<Herostar-Discorded> welp i waited long nuff!
<twilight_sprinkle> Sweetiebells talent is clearly voice cracking
<Thrackerzod> METH LAB
<turtlegod98> ALCHEMY level 1, applebloom has a long way to go.
<Vivix> I love pony lore
<XylemTube> AAAAND they still havent learned
<PONY> TO THE METH LAB!
<Canadian_Brony> RoboGanjalf I was just pointing out the symbol.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Remember the rules though: 1.) Follows our Rules 2.) Less than 5 minutes (to save on time instead of 7 :)) 3.) No multiple parts 4.) One request per User
<Reikim> Chitti: Essentially, yes. Unicorns couldn't possibly hope to feed everyone, as their fields wouldn't grow enough.
<RoboGanjalf> Canadian_Brony: i know
<Herostar-Discorded> As a wicca i really know alchemy..
<Dark92ChittyV2> OK.........that was the LONGEST MOVIE NIGHT I HAVE EVER WITNESSED
<Herostar-Discorded> -big boom-
<Kandarihu> Alright. I was laying around for too long there.
<Dark92ChittyV2> AND IT WAS AWESOME
<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 does that mean it's open?
<Herostar-Discorded> and it's not easy T-T
<Jim> Lalalalalala~
<Pikachu> nice drawing
<Chitti> 01,11Twilight_Sprinkle: actually, the voice cracks are a foreshadowing to Sweetie Belle having a talent for singing, as she doesn't differentiate her singing voice from her speaking voice yet.
<mitamaking> ...
<flutter_spin> WOOT
<mitamaking> This is new
<twilight_sprinkle> Chitti: dont all kids get voice cracks?
<otakon> SuperBrony64: where are requests going?
<Pikachu> hmmmmmmmmm

<Jim> I like them space ponies
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The request room is #Vinyl_Scratch , head on in there, once the room is unmutted, you can post your requests :)
<otakon> it's SuperBrony64
<Vivix> not all kids twilight_sprinkle it's most common in boys, but it's a different cracking sound
<howdyx> .
<howdyx> б
<Reikim> SuperBrony64: I AM WAITING WITH ONE FINGER ON CONTROL AND ANOTHER ON V
<Vivix> Sweetie's voice crack is really common in female singers- people like the sound of it
<howdyx> lalala
<Chitti> 01,11Twilight_Sprinkle: yes, but in Ponyville, the only character who's voice cracks on a regular basis is Sweety Belle, which is why it's so unique.
<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 how will we know when it's unmuted?
<turtlegod98> Well, it's been fun and all but I'm gona get some shut eye now. It's 1 am so Good night everyone!

<flutter_spin> Not me.
<JESmith71> SuperBrony how long will you be doing request tonight? I'm trying to get one uploaded but it'll take over 100 minutes. If you could only take Dailymotion requests I wouldn't have to go through the trouble of getting back on YouTube
<Jmo4267> I thought it was that Chitti.
<Pikachu> is this the r request room?
<otakon> SuperBrony64: goddammit less than five minutes? dammit

<Canadian_Brony> flutter_spin: eeeugh
<Chitti> 01,11Once Upon a Time is a series that modernizes and links all the classic Grimm Fairy Tales, and even includes general mythologies as well, into a whole complex story and then topped of with dragging them into the reality of our world.
<Canadian_Brony> oh
<Canadian_Brony> whatev
<Bronysith> Chitti: I FUCKING LOVE THAT SERIES
<RustyMeat> is the streamer taking requests?
<Canadian_Brony> not into fantasy stuff likethat
<flutter_spin> The series is very well put together, but I find it a bit too weird and dark for my taste
<Canadian_Brony> RustyMeat eeyup
<Chitti> 01,11It's a creative and surprisingly adult tv series.
<mitamaking> Chitti: Isn't that Grimm? :p
<FUS_RO_yay> Oh God why.

<twilight_sprinkle> Major: well then it cant be streamed, chat is cloesed, your suggestion didnt go thru, sry
<pony_2038> that's not loving or tolerating....but I like it
<PONY> all BS movies should be slightly edited to have some pony stuff in them, for example characters appearing in corner... for example Twi spotting false facts, stating "Actually... *the fact*", Pinkie yelling party, Vinyl wubbing "AWWWWW YEAH" etc... just small little fun things, like some of the sound effects.
<Kandarihu> That was amazing
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Requests start now :)

<Pudge> FUS_RO_yay: obsidian is just as good because it would take forever to break through obsidian with you rfist
<Pudge> fist*

<FUS_RO_yay> Pudge: But bedrock NEVAR breaks.
<[Alpha]> Nothing
