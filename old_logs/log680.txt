<Tassadork> rats will actually hunt and eat mice...
<AJIsAwesome> flutterchu: SHe's basically a monocolor RD.
<drphantom> yeah

<Austin> Fl00t4hSh41: thatd be boring
<Tassadork> surprise! no safe tiles
<CrimsonPhoenix> Alchemist, I've been wondering yesterday about who voiced Daring Doo
<Wirisme> but in the latin alphabet, jehova starts with an i
<Combustiblelemons> She's smarter too.
<sonicdude558> Want it need it
<alexxm> Tassadork perhaps she meant to ponies?
<Nyst> So has an Indy/Daring/Lara crossover fanfic been written yet?
<wowviewer> How about all are big except for rats lol
<Dark92Enigma> flutterchu: Basically yes, it's a recolor......but her cutie mark is a compass
<Combustiblelemons> suddenly, lava.
<Alchemist> CrimsonPhoenix: She sounds a bit like RD so I assume its Ashleigh
<Dark92Enigma> USE THE MOUTH

<Kotano> Wheelchair..for a broken wing
<Austin> wingboner
*sonicdude558 cringes
<Dark92Enigma> SICK
<SteveCharb> tiny ponies are... more distracting, somehow?
<Bogy> the paaaiiin
<LordDerpington> I've been wheeled out in a wheelchair for wisdom tooth extraction. Standard thing, really.
<DaringDerpy> this time it is lupus
<SteveCharb> HEALTHCARE FRAUD
<Nyst> You know I had the same thing when I was in the hospital as a kid. Except it was a videotape of a cartoon. I watched it again and again and wished I could take it home with me when I left.
<AJIsAwesome> SEEMS LEGIT
<Alchemist> According to IMDB Chiara Zanni is the VA of Daring Do http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0953065/
<drphantom> caramell & lyra at the bottom XD

<SteveCharb> HEALTH INSURANCE OR GTFO
<CrimsonPhoenix> TAKCARE
<Quick_Thinker> i think we can just watch the credits to see who the voice of Daring is
<sonicdude558> What am I gonna doo?
<J_E_Smith71> SteveCharb: Mods usually have Desktop Ponies on screen
<Dark92Enigma> INB4 SNAKE MODE
<sonicdude558> :trollface:
<Barbetos> taekcaur!!
<LordDerpington> The credits never show the full cast.
<Combustiblelemons> Metal gear time.
<J_E_Smith71> Quick_Thinker: They usually don't change the credits and just have the main cast
<Meanwhile> Metal Gear.
<Applejack2012> reused music
<Alchemist> im a ninja im a hoody ninja
<Kotano> Quick_Thinker Chiara Zanni,she also voiced Twist
<Quick_Thinker> well thats buckin cheap
<Austin> Metal solid gear
<SteveCharb> J_E_Smith71: I know, but them being tiny is more distracting for me
<CrimsonPhoenix> Quick_Thinker, they don't show the credit for minor voice role
<Squallken> I love her big eyes
<J_E_Smith71> Even deLancie didn't get credited either
<drphantom> RD squee
<LordDerpington> Squee
<Dark92Enigma> SQUEE <3 :D
<Quick_Thinker> minor my plot
<Saigneur> SQUEE
<sonicdude558> :(
<RainbowAsh> Quick_Thinker, they didn't even credit John DeLancy
*Fl00t4hSh41 starts humming the Mission impossible theme
<Combustiblelemons> why is there such security in this place?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Quick_Thinker, Minor as in the whole series
<nonody2> Why do they need guards here? Are the slippers that valuble?
<sonicdude558> HELP
<sonicdude558> lol
<Meanwhile> In case of ninjas?
*Dark92Enigma Derpy: YOU OK, RAINBOW DASH
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons: because the plot demands it

<Applejack2012> alarms and smoke detrectors canon
<Combustiblelemons> seriously, what is this the penitentiary for the criminally insane?
<SteveCharb> sometimes stars who camoe ask not to be credited, so as to not distract from the main cast
<RainbowAsh> Wait, was that Supernaturals?

<J_E_Smith71> Bogy: Yu-Gi-Oh
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons: implying theres a currency in equestria, and that bits are really used for much of anything
<Soulero> i love it when all the enforcers are afk or asleep
<pony_1072> English or Japanese?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and that was my reaction on yesterday's lottery http://arch.413chan.net/Pinkie_Pie_Rocket_Take_Off_Animated-(n1329765068698).gif
<weegee2062> intermisson wut
<pony_300> Pony episode just finished I take it?
<Bogy> oh... okay.... the motorsycle yu gi oh or the "normal" one?
<Quick_Thinker> i already bitched about yu gi yestery TIME TO DO IT AGAIN WITH STYLEEEEEEE
<Combustiblelemons> what, they just give out houses free?
<Bogy> ^^
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons: probably
<J_E_Smith71> pony_1072: English
<sonicdude558> yo Soulero, ahem Sumica
<Meanwhile> Inb4 you activated my trap card.
<weegee2062> hello
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons: maybe in larger cities, the bits are actually useful
<Soulero> sonicdude558 huh?
<Sumica> 00,10hmmmm?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, weegee2062. :)
<Combustiblelemons> ... let me go to equestria. NOW.
<pony_1072> Pass... 4Kids ruins it
<weegee2062> hi
<sonicdude558> Sumica is a mod
<Applejack2012> hi
<Sumica> 00,10me what?
<RainbowAsh> I just realized something. In Cutie Mark Chronicles, they all get their marks when RD does her rainboom. But for Applejack it is morning, while it is evening for Pinkie.
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons: in the smaller communes they all likely just work ffor free
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01~yay~
<J_E_Smith71> pony_1072: But it's fun as hell to make fun of in chat
<Dark92Enigma> Quick_Thinker: i'll join too! No critic should go on this movie ALONE
<Soulero> sonicdude558 what have i done?
<Combustiblelemons> so... where do they get money for food?
<sonicdude558> nothing
<Quick_Thinker> LETS DO IT DARK HIGH HOOF
<Kencolt> RainbowAsh: Not really-- it's more the rock farm is overcast. ALWAYS.
<sonicdude558> I thought you said that you love it when the mods are asleep
<Quick_Thinker> /)
<Sundaysmile> next is yu-gi-oh?
<Soulero> no
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/kzcb3.jpg
<Austin> Quick_Thinker: /)
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons: well, they still have money, but they dont really need it, because everyone gives everything away for free, unless they really need money
<sonicdude558> ok
<Applejack2012> mods asleep post ponies
<CrimsonPhoenix> prepare your trapcard ponies
<Dark_Horst> Dark92Enigma: he meant you4
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons: as demonstrated in the show
<Soulero> sonicdude558 apb reloaded is a game
<flutterchu> http://s1260.photobucket.com/albums/ii571/flutterchu2/?action=view&current=twilightsparkle_zps09df33c2.png
<J_E_Smith71> ANYWAYS. For those who missed lotto yesterday. Winners were King's Speech and Powerpuff Girls Movie. Pony eps are Dragon Quest and Sonic Rainboom
<Dark92Enigma> RainbowAsh: Different towns, different time slot, i guess
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause this is going to be one heck of a rollercoaster
<sonicdude558> never mind Sumica, sorry for waking u up
<sonicdude558> lol
<Quick_Thinker> that high hoof was for dark but what evs Austin /)
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/GSloF.jpg
<weegee2062> :)
<Dark92Enigma> Dark_Horst: you4? for what?
<RainbowAsh> Kencolt, maybe, but the family goes into the farm house just before the rainboom and don't come out until the next morning.
<Austin> Quick_Thinker: theres enough brohoofs to go around
<Combustiblelemons> So Equestria is some sort of communist-democracy-monarchy?
<sonicdude558> Oh Meanwhile, what have you done
<giveasmilegetasmile> flutterchu: lol
<Dark92Enigma> Quick_Thinker: /)
<Quick_Thinker> yes austin yes there are
<Dark_Horst> Dark92Enigma: i knew you'd do that
<Applejack2012> http://i48.tinypic.com/2wf0pwh.jpg
<sonicdude558> BUFFER! NOT THE BUFFER!
<Austin> wheres superbrony64?
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons: its not really any established form of government, but yeah you can call it that
<kidzrul434> OMC BRONIES! I WAS ON MAMAMEDIA.COM AND IT'S STILL ONLINE!
<Dark_Horst> Dark92Enigma: hey, laptop keaboard, not much space between enter and the numblock
<RainbowAsh> Dark92Enigma, different time zones like that would mean Equestria was huge
<Dark92Enigma> Dark_Horst: i'm in a good mood today
<Kencolt> Combustiblelemons: Equestria is a MAGICAL KINGDOM. POlitics are irrelevant.
<Dark92Enigma> RainbowAsh: yes, it is
<Sumica> 00,10that is a fail bingo chat, the center is not free.
<Combustiblelemons> politics are always relevant.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Combustiblelemons: Socialist Democratic constitutional Monarchy? Like half of scandinavia?
<sonicdude558> oh noes the room has turned into wannabe mods
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Equestria has an absolute monarchy (though it's a rule of two) for a govt. and what seems to be a capitalist economic system.
<Combustiblelemons> I always considered moving to Norway or somewhere near there Fl00t4hSh41
<Dark92Enigma> Ok, Austin if you want, you can join us
<Applejack2012> http://th01.deviantart.net/fs70/300W/f/2012/217/4/2/my_little_pony_s3_movie_poster_by_xxgrosscutterxx-d59z5pg.png
<sonicdude558> I love this song :)
<Quick_Thinker> well i guess me and Dark92Enigma are your two offical critics of the movie since i already saw it and am a fan of yu gi so i'd be perfect to rip on it
<Combustiblelemons> Now it's a serious consideration.
<Dark_Horst> 4.1%
<Dark_Horst> so much speed
<Fl00t4hSh41> Combustiblelemons: Norway would certainly be near scandinavia
<kidzrul434> nopony cares about what i said
<Meanwhile> Correct.
<Bogy> oh man.. *notice to myself: bring popcorn for next week*
<Bogy> ^^
<Fl00t4hSh41> Combustiblelemons: Watch out for the local Viking tribes
<Quick_Thinker> kidzrul434 i do
<cowvarkian> well, theres no real monarchy, as the leaders dont die, and the only economy we've seen so far only uses money when they buy things that are seasonal products, or out of their commune.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Combustiblelemons: they like to go raiding
<Quick_Thinker> isnt it great being a nerd though
<Combustiblelemons> I'll be sure to enroll for some pillaging and fun.
<sonicdude558> Cricket Cricket
<Quick_Thinker> ^ what game are u talking about
<kidzrul434> I sad that Mamamedia.com is still online!
<cowvarkian> Quick_Thinker: life
<Dark_Horst> behold: Ogre
<Quick_Thinker> i see
<Combustiblelemons> i don't know the geography of northern europe ok :S
<Fl00t4hSh41> Combustiblelemons: That it is...
<Dark92Enigma> Quick_Thinker: i was a HUGE YU-GI-OH fan too.......but i didn't see the movie on theaters, but on VHS. due to economic/family issues. so i'm still looking for the special card '' the Shining Blue Eyed Dragon''
<Quick_Thinker> i fail at this game but any other game i rock at :D
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma: I used to have on of those
<Fl00t4hSh41> Combustiblelemons: The Irish usually get all uppity about their monestaries being burnt though...
<Combustiblelemons> what?
<Yahooz> I bought the DVD solely for the BESD
<Quick_Thinker> you mean blue eyes shinging dragon? well stop looking its only worth *checks ebay* 3.50
<Combustiblelemons> Thought they were mad because northern ireland's not theirs any more.
<Dark92Enigma> Quick_Thinker: i digress, i was quite a great player back in the day.....the anime was awesome, and the manga was, you guessed it.....AWESOME!
<Fl00t4hSh41> Combustiblelemons: When they leave a convent full of silver, guarded by nuns in the middle of nowhere
<Fl00t4hSh41> Combustiblelemons: And then they get all indignant when you loot the place
<Yahooz> BESD is worthless now because the Yu-gi-oh franchise has to continue to make stuff more and more OP until rediculessness occurs
<sonicdude558> wow the chat is getting pretty slow :(
<cowvarkian> Fl00t4hSh41: ok, so we're talking about medieval europe then...
<Fl00t4hSh41> Combustiblelemons: I'm not sure what they think would happen when they do that....
<Combustiblelemons> Well they should have guards.
<Quick_Thinker> i got my BESD from an epic duel against um well this going to sound crazy but slavery for a year so i got a awesome card if i won but i would be personal slave if i lost
<Yahooz> yet its also somewhat collectable
<cowvarkian> Quick_Thinker: thats rediculous
<Combustiblelemons> that right there was some bad thinking from our irish friends.
<FlaschenJoe11> sonicdude558: That's cause during intermission people do sensible things like going to the bathroom.
<Quick_Thinker> sonicdude558 its slow thanks to intermission everyone is getting popcorn
<sonicdude558> oh ok
<Combustiblelemons> Wait how did we get from a discussion of the economics of equestria to pillaging ireland?
<Dark92Enigma> Quick_Thinker: it's AVAILABLE? (cue Ode Of Joy)
<otakon> sorry guys
<otakon> gotta go
<Quick_Thinker> no clue just roll with it

<otakon> ValtheJean: thanks for the stream man
<sonicdude558> Ding ding ding dinner's done
<Combustiblelemons> Because Vikings... As good a reason as any.
<Dark92Enigma> Yahooz: *sighs* which is why the franchise is going nowhere these days
<Kencolt> Combustiblelemons: That kind of thing happenes a lot here. Heck, Ireland, I'm surpised no-one mentioned potatoes and immigration-- wait, I just did.
<Meanwhile> Bow bow bow bow bow
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: yes Meanwhile ?

<Combustiblelemons> I miss his shenanigans.

<Yahooz> oh god were you there when he face-cammed/ did a dramatic reading?
<Combustiblelemons> Like when he tripped over his computer cable and took stream offline live on webcam.
<cowvarkian> Quick_Thinker: can you just leave, and not get your deck lit on fire?
<Combustiblelemons> I've never laughed so hard in my life.
<Quick_Thinker> what do you think i did

<Dark92Enigma> Oh, that’s a good sign <-----------
<Combustiblelemons> ohgod that logo
<Quick_Thinker> YOUR THE WRONG SHOW

<Meanwhile> Long ago in a distant land.
<Kencolt> Fl00t4hSh41: No cycles here.
<Dark92Enigma> <---- What, the people who do catering will be next?----------
<Quick_Thinker> they called it pokemon
<Fl00t4hSh41> Kencolt: What a jib.
<pony_7902> rANDOM PONY, YEAH.
<Combustiblelemons> Time for some cardgames on motorcycles.
<pony_7902> R
<Dark92Enigma> Oh, and just like the Pokemon movie, we get a little background information so all the newcomers can follow along, but it will drive older fans impatient, and will befuddle newcomers
<DerpyMuffins> Dat announcer
<SteveCharb> heart of the cards yuuuuuuuuuuuuuugi
<alexxm> what
<CrimsonPhoenix> ValtheJean, can you turn up the volume?
<Wirisme> wat
<Kotano> Oh Yu-Gi-h The Movie.Your story is complete bullshit,you have no idea about the rules of your own game,and your dialogue is just plain awful.I love you,Yu-Gi-Oh
*Dark92Enigma NEWBIE: OK, What is the Game Of Shadows? Next thing we know, the Romans played Pokemon.
<Combustiblelemons> that makes no sense.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tehehe. He's wearing a skirt.
<Meanwhile> So...why do we have subs?
<Quick_Thinker> his name was pharoph wears to much hair gel
<alexxm> thats what eternity means
<pony_300> NoNo No! No pokemon! Fuck you Ash and your broke ass Pikachu!
<Nyst> Eternity doesn't last forever? What?
<Fl00t4hSh41> Kencolt: where are people supposed to play their cardgames if not on motorcycles?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01By definition, eternity lasts forever.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Nyst> Yuh Gi Oh No!
<Kencolt> Fl00t4hSh41: In giant holographic stadiums.
<TrixieMuffins> enter ...the Twilight Zone
<Dark_Horst> until a kid puzzled it together
<Quick_Thinker> Scrwatch your back head to show frustartation
*Dark92Enigma NEWBIE: OK, What are the Millennium Items, and the Millennium Puzzle for that matter??
<CrimsonPhoenix> Fl00t4hSh41, by standing still
<Fl00t4hSh41> Kencolt: It's just not the same....
<Starchaser> WE KNOW THAT
<pony_972> Am I imagining things or does the narrative repeat itself.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A bolt of lightning helped him solve it?
<Quick_Thinker> this movice was neveer to happen and 3 years it did
<Dark_Horst> a kid with a suspiciously masculine voice
*Meanwhile in Egypt...
<Quick_Thinker> thanks to 4kids
<Glitch> http://derpy.me/DZPMh
<adasdad> dat hair
<Combustiblelemons> they found it was a secret bondage lair
<CrimsonPhoenix> Glitch, http://i.imgur.com/kzcb3.jpg
*Dark92Enigma NEWBIE: Wasn’t Anubis in that movie with Brendan Freiser?
<pony_300> worst part about the anime is how there's little of Yugi mindcrushing people
<Combustiblelemons> bondage?
<Quick_Thinker> it glowed
<Quick_Thinker> dont ask lemosn
<Nyst> Why is a kid even allowed to touch thousands years old egyptian artefacts with his bare hands?
<pony_300> honestly that puzzle never looked too complicated
<Fl00t4hSh41> It took yugi a whole millenium to solve that thing?
<Quick_Thinker> okay let me point out now im typing fast so sorry for spelling mistakes
<Epicmetalfreak> yay i solved a nine piece puzzle xD
<adasdad> nyst: his hair opens all doors.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Theres like 20 pieces
<Reactor> How did he come into possession of this ancient puzzle?
<Nyst> I know right? I could do a puzzle like that in my sleep!
<Quick_Thinker> the last piecce in the anime was thrown into a river
<RainbowAsh> Nyst: Same reason why no one solved that puzzle in 5000 years
<Dark_Horst> okay, let's sum up. the protagonist is a 10 year old kid in bondage gear with the voice of a 20 year old and a thing for ridiculusly large jewelry
<Iwa> People in egyptian times obviously were idiots...:P
<AJIsAwesome> ded
<Glitch> Reactor his grandpa stole it from a tumb
<pony_972> I love it how he doesn't care at all about the glowy light thing.
<Dark_Horst> yep, nothing weird here
<adasdad> nice going dude, you killed em'
<Kotano> Quick_Thinker Joey retrieved it
<Kencolt> lag. Much lag.
<CriticKitten> So basically Yugi directly caused the death of those researchers
<AJIsAwesome> Dat overdramatic music :S
<Combustiblelemons> Why not distribute the puzzle pieces across the sea?
<Fl00t4hSh41> Iwa: YOu saw what they did to that priest in The Mummy
<RainbowAsh> Ded
<Meanwhile> Being crushed to death by rocks. You know, for kids.
<Combustiblelemons> that way, noone will ever find it.
<pony_972> Why not sink them to the bottom of the sea?
<adasdad> UUUUUULTRA ded
<Nyst> You'd think the archeologists would know egyptian.
<Glitch> Ded you know for kids
<CrimsonPhoenix> wait....was it sub yesterday?
<Fl00t4hSh41> Iwa: Gave him a grudge against them and then gave him superpowers
<Reactor> I heard "ankh"
<DaringDerpy> he summoned cthulhu
<Quick_Thinker> for 5000 years it was locked away until some kid with too much hairgel put the puzzle together the exacct ame time as these smucks discover a cave COINCIDENCE
<Combustiblelemons> well done kid.
<SteveCharb> satanic tongues, you know, for kids
<DaringDerpy> great
<pony_300> some people like popped collars... Yugi likes dog collars.
<Nyst> It's going to turn him into a supersayan.
<Iwa> Fl00t4hSh41: Exactly :)
<Quick_Thinker> GREAT JOB YOU UNLEASHED HELL
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH GAWD A KURIBOH
<CriticKitten> KURIBOH OH GOD
<Combustiblelemons> littlekuriboh ftw
<Dark92Enigma> AN ENTIRE ARMY OF MONSTERS SURROUNDS HIM, and HE’S SCARED OF A KURIBOH! :D
<SteveCharb> it's just a little kuriboh
<Quick_Thinker> oh hi KIRRBOH
<CrimsonPhoenix> YU GI OOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
<Applejack2012> hi
<Meanwhile> I never got why he says that.
<AJIsAwesome> YU GI OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH
<Vordox> SUERP SA...no
<Iwa> title drop, already?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So is this movie Hellraiser for kids?
<pinkiespice> i miss the oringal shadow games
<DerpyMuffins> Dat title drop
<CriticKitten> PENALTY GAME! Wait, sorry, I was channeling the GOOD series.
<Reactor> Because I scream my name whenever I get scared
<BladedWings> nice, i come back to the B movie!
<Quick_Thinker> PUSSY HAIR GEL POWER ACTIAVE
<CrimsonPhoenix> Warning this movie contains Dan Green
<Vordox> DAT VOICE
<pony_300> gtfo little kuriboh
<Fl00t4hSh41> Puberty hit that kid pretty hard
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because that was a movie about a puzzle unleashing evil.
<Combustiblelemons> WE GET IT NARRATOR
<SteveCharb> Reactor: or orgasm?
<pony_972> So, uh, he screams the name of some card game when he unleashes the power of the amulet?
<Dark_Horst> now he's a 20 year old in bondage gear who sounds like a 50 year old
*Dark92Enigma NEWBIE: Who are you!?
<pony_972> Why exactly is that?
<CriticKitten> Way to doom the world, Yugi!
<pony_300> ohh speaking of which, there must be an abirdged movie of this
<Dark_Horst> still a thing for ridiculously large jewelry
<adasdad> apparently demonic possession dramatically speeds up puberty
<GabeMoist> OOoooooo
<Quick_Thinker> man i wish i could talk over this moviee and be heard instead of typing this shit out
<Dark92Enigma> THIS IS OUR MOVIE
<Starchaser> fun fact the voice of the pharoh also is the voice of the dad in the 3rd pokemon movie
<CriticKitten> pony_972: No, the card game is called Duel Monsters. :P
<Quick_Thinker> IT IS
<pony_972> Oh.
<Quick_Thinker> in the 3 years since this show
<Quick_Thinker> a movie was made
<Reactor> He cheats
<Nyst> Poor pyramids. They sure get abused by everything sci-fi or fantasy.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Why does everyone dress in such silly outfits?
<SteveCharb> card games are serious business
<Quick_Thinker> oh hey looks its the chick we will never see again and only seen in the show
<CriticKitten> Well that's a stupid narration, it's because he cheats his ass off. THAT is why he wins
<Quick_Thinker> HI
<Nyst> I think even the power rangers had a pyramid robot once.
<pony_300> I think Japan's anime is bleeding over into reality with their ridic hairdos
<adasdad> Fl00t4hSh41: because anime
<CrimsonPhoenix> My boobs are too big for this movie
<Fl00t4hSh41> And whats with those haircuts?
<Combustiblelemons> because anime Fl00t4hSh41
<RainbowAsh> So, how did they go from unleashed artifact to those duel games?
<pony_972> Is the reason that he is good, or does he win because his deck is overpowered? Oh, I don't know...
<Dark92Enigma> Oh yeah, they forgot to mention that Yugi became King Of Games…… by DEFEATING MAXIMILIAN PEGASUS!
<pony_7902> It's time to d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d - duel.
<Quick_Thinker> IT WAS THE HEART OF THE CARDS HEART OF SPADES

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so their powers it get more attack points
<SteveCharb> POWER OVERWHELMING
<SafariMonkey> Hello!
<Quick_Thinker> and this kids is why the Egyptian cards are banned from tournys
<Nyst> Shame they never made the game MTG, then at least I could follow what they were doing.
<CriticKitten> alexxm: Technically, this is legit. In theory. >_>
<Vordox> SERIOUSLY LISTEN TO YOURSELF YUGI
<Reactor> Like I said. He cheats.
*GabeMoist gets INFINITE DEFENSE
<pony_972> There's more to power than attack power! So, I'll proceed to make my attack power infinite!
<Franek12354> hax
<pony_972> My logic holds!
<adasdad> i wonder if i another world there's an anime based off of poker. "BY PLACING MY TREE THREES ALONG SIDE MY TWO SEVENS, I ACTIVATE THE POWER OF THE FULL HOUSE!"

<DaringDerpy> I need sleep. Good night bronies. :)
<Dark92Enigma> -----This was a simulation the whole time? WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?
<Vordox> Unbalanced much?
<Quick_Thinker> how is a system overloading from that
<AJIsAwesome> Night, DaringDerpy. :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX
<SteveCharb> smoking computers? must be Dell
<Dark_Horst> so running a simulation breaks the simulator. i'd say your design is flawed
<Applejack2012> cya
<Meanwhile> Uuuu.
<Nyst> Not even scientists can figure out a cardgame.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night DaringDerpy
<pony_972> Calculations? "1+1+1=1, now we'll win for sure!"
<Soulero> uahhhhuuhauhauhh
<Quick_Thinker> my "system" only overloads on things like ARMA 2 explosions
<Dark92Enigma> me I’m gonna call the FBI, the FCC, the CIA, but first and foremost, you are FIRED!!!
<BladedWings> nite DaringDerpy
<Meanwhile> Whaddya mean "as usual"? you always lose.
<alexxm> bye DaringDerpy
<Combustiblelemons> I prefer littlekuribohs version.
<pony_300> I don't understand how anyone would think that could beat a setup with an monster that can get infinite strength. Though, it feels like this is a rather dumbed down strategy
<Reactor> Start looking in Egypt?
<CriticKitten> There is, Seto. Just beat him up and steal the cards.
<Iwa> Wavy cloak in a closed building...Anime.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i know use Black hole
<CriticKitten> Moron.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile, he tries. Give him credit.
<Cades> Why would you do that lol
<eleanorawesome> fissure
<Nyst> Well if there isn't then the game would be horribly imbalanced.
<eleanorawesome> done
<DerpyMuffins> "Srew rules, I got money"-Seto Kiba
<RainbowAsh> pony_300, are there no creature killing cards in yugioh?
<Quick_Thinker> OH HI GUY WHO GETS NO EXPLAINTION OF WHO HE IS
<Combustiblelemons> SPAH AROUND HERE
<Fl00t4hSh41> But Kaiba's company basically makes all the cards right?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> because it wasn't working.
<Quick_Thinker> hint his name is pegasus
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: That's been tried. Didn't end well.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> It had severe water damage
<Combustiblelemons> spah sappin' mah memories
<Meanwhile> Kaiba is way too hung up on this card game. Maybe he should take up tennis instead.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Why doesn't he just make new and more powerful cards?
<Quick_Thinker> he created the card game
<CriticKitten> It's that one guy that no one who hasn't seen this show knows!
<Dark92Enigma> OMG IT'S THE LADY OF WATER
<TrixieMuffins> why not use exodia , it was good enough in season 1
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so the iso displaced the water
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and cleaned it out a bit.
<adasdad> O NO IMA VAMPIRE!
<Cades> oh ok
<Reactor> FABULOUS!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> But its basically an ipod now without wifi.
<Nyst> Mom! Buy me that card!
<ASoftFluffyThing> SPARKLES
<pony_300> RainbowAsh: Pretty sure they have those, but god cards I think have protection against trap and magic cards used on them
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> the cellular chip ius screwed
<Quick_Thinker> CHATING IT CREEPY CHANTING IS CREEPY CHANTING IS CREEPY
<Cades> :/
<Combustiblelemons> horrible?
*pinkiespice looks at the yugioh wallscroll in his cloest
<Combustiblelemons> more what the hell
<Dark92Enigma> TrixieMuffins: Yugi lost those cards, IIRC
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meowth that's right jame... i mean pegasus
<eleanorawesome> dream about a card game = nightmare
<alexxm> that was a nightmare?
<AJIsAwesome> Wine Spritzer? I thought this was a kids movie?
<Combustiblelemons> he should have my dreams....
<Dark92Enigma> LAWL
<Tassadork> augh! my depth perception
<Nyst> Pfffhahahaa, wine spritzers
<SteveCharb> one half of this show's two American characters, everyone
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm: more like a PREMONITION
<pony_972> Yes, Yugi will continue to win tournaments by cheating. Terrible!
<RainbowAsh> pony_300, I see. That is overpowered
<pony_300> I wonder what it looks like under Pegasus's hair
<Dragon1029> is this a yugi-oh movie?
<Kotano> the Millenium Eye didn't predict the future -.-
<pinkiespice> yes
<ASoftFluffyThing> Something wicked this way comes.
<Epicmetalfreak> Dragon1029: yep it is
<Dark92Enigma> PLOT POINT!
<CriticKitten> I'm pretty sure that the whole "Pyramid of Light is able to block the God Cards" thing is just the writers trying to bail themselves out of having to figure out how Yugi could possibly lose with the three most powerful cards in existence all in his deck.
<Quick_Thinker> YES PLEASE TELL US ABOUT YOUR EYE ORRRRRRR JUST SAY IT AND NOWTHING ELSE GREAT JOB explaining it to newcomers GREAT FUCKIN JOB
<pony_7902> Iced earth
<Quick_Thinker> OVER EGO GO
<DerpyMuffins> Dat plane
<pony_972> Random Lyra.
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 cheesy song
<Quick_Thinker> he has so much fuckin money HE HAS HIS CARD AS JETY
<Dark92Enigma> CriticKitten: just another Deus-Ex-Machina
<CriticKitten> You just wish you were baws enough to own a dragon jet.
<pinkiespice> actaully, the millenium eye gave the user greate insight
<alexxm> why does he even have this thing
<Nyst> Okay that kid has wayy too much money.
<Kotano> this is so Top Gun
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> CriticKitten use black hole
<LordDerpington> What's your vector, Victor?
<DerpyMuffins> His ego is so big he has his own jet
<Combustiblelemons> Metal gears' got everything on this.
<SteveCharb> FLYYY INTOOO THE DANGER ZONE
<Quick_Thinker> he has so much fuckin money HE HAS HIS CARD AS JETY
<Meanwhile> Seriously Kaiba have you thought of maybe putting your millions to better use than playing card games?
<Saturn> 08,01man
<RainbowAsh> What does this scene have to do with anything?
<Quick_Thinker> CRAPPY SONG GO
<Dark92Enigma> You gotta love the soundtrack……..:|
<pinkiespice> they can't see the future, but they can sense it. :U
<Lil_B> I always wondered how he can finance everything of that?!
<CriticKitten> TGAPT: Wouldn't help. :P
<Dragon1029> Thunderbirds Are Go!
<adasdad> bronystate sometime should stream a movie with a moustache over it.
<Saturn> 08,01that kaiba guy has a major blue eyes white dragon fetish
<Meanwhile> Especially card games that you take way too seriously anyway.
<Nyst> That dialogue...
<TrixieMuffins> Boresight mode ?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile There is nothing more useful than card games
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: IKR? :D
<Quick_Thinker> NO I THINK YOU DONT HAVE IT ALL
<Sumica> 00,10it's so tough being kiba
<pony_300> and yet the way the god cards really were beaten was totally cheesy in the anime. It was like a the equivilent of taking advantage of a glitch
<Saigneur> Lil_B: winning every game before yu gi
<CriticKitten> Saturn: I explained that yesterday. There's actually a reason in-canon for it.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Saturn, he pets it in his dreams. ;)
<DerpyMuffins> Money well spent
<Vordox> INSERT NON-TACTICAL MUSIC
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<pinkiespice> Saturn: he attack yugi grandfather for his blueeyes
<Quick_Thinker> man the lyrics make kabi seem to be wanting friends
<Saturn> 08,01this song sounds like AcousticBrony's Loyaly
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> CriticKitten it does, god cards have no description therefore i can destroy them with black hole
<Dark92Enigma> Fuck it, i'm gonna play a more decent song: I WENT THROUGH THE DAAAANGER ZONE
<adasdad> screw aero dynamics, i have money!
<Saturn> 08,01*Loyalty
<Vordox> Saturn: Oh really?
<Combustiblelemons> i know right saturn
<Combustiblelemons> i hate that song just as much :/
<BladedWings> damn you Crush 40!!
<GabeMoist> My shoes >>>>>>> Kaiba's shoes
<CriticKitten> TGAPT: Not in this universe. :p
<Quick_Thinker> RANDOM ZONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Lil_B> man... this localized Soundtrack :/
<Dark92Enigma> GONNA TAKE YOU RIGHT INTO THE RANDOM ZOOOOOOOOOOOONE
<pony_300> this is Crush40? NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Quick_Thinker> song says he wants friends ... GOES FOR CARD INSTEAD
<pinkiespice> o-o
<Nyst> So he's got to be really easy to beat in tournaments. Oh him? let me get out my anti-dragon deck. He never changes it anyway.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> CriticKitten i'm not in that universe
<adasdad> wine spritzer is best bevearge
<pinkiespice> all he does is drink wine?
<Nyst> Merci beaucoup!
<AJIsAwesome> Kaiba-boy
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Kaiba-Booooi~
<Sumica> 00,10if it's vtol, why did he cat launch it?
<Marx> Oh great.
<Kotano> Wasn't there even a Black Eyed Peas Song somewhere on the Soundtrack for this movie?
<Meanwhile> Yeah I bet having enough money to have a personal jet in the shape of your favourite playing card must be real tough on the nerves.
<CriticKitten> How about a massage? :D
<weegee2062> hugs
<SteveCharb> adasdad: that think gets like 1/6 the fuel mileage of a normal plane of similar size.... worth it
<Combustiblelemons> only george takei can say oh my.
<Quick_Thinker> pegasus actually does make this movie saveed
*Saigneur hugs everypony
<CriticKitten> No he didn't :D
<alexxm> the game
<SteveCharb> *tbing
*AJIsAwesome hugs Saigneur
<Sumica> 00,10the game
<Sumica> 00,10he made it
<pony_300> FISHIES
<Quick_Thinker> U JUST LOST IT
<Vordox> Sumica: That voice reminds me of James from Pokemon
<RainbowAsh> I thought the egyptians made the game?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica and the he lost it
<Lil_B> this sounds like some kind of abridged fan dub :/
<adasdad> card games: srs bsnss
<Quick_Thinker> Vordox thats becuase it is
<Sumica> 00,10it is James
<CriticKitten> He made the cards. Not the game. Again, later canon explains. :p
<Lil_B> is this really the original?
<Saturn> 08,01this is the first time i've seen the real YuGiOh
<Sumica> 00,10and the other one is brock
<Vordox> Sumica: Oh mai, voice sense tingling
<pony_300> LET ME SEE YOUR MISSING EYEHOLE
<Saturn> 08,01and man, littlekurriboh has some of these voices down really fucking well
<Sumica> 00,10how odd.
<Panda> Saturn! you has clothes!!!
<Combustiblelemons> my thoughts exactly
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: This is a TERRIBLE example of the real YuGiOh.
<Quick_Thinker> in our world these cards are worth about .25 cents
<Sumica> 00,10I dont recall there being subs when i played this yesterday
<Meanwhile> There weren't.
<pinkiespice> Saturn: blue eyes are rare because only 3 exist in all of existance in the series
<Dark92Enigma> By the way, there’s another common flaw in this movie. I want you guys to point it out:
<Quick_Thinker> JOEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
<Soulero> woah how funny
<Dragon1029> Which Yu-Gi-Oh movie is this?
<SteveCharb> this brooklyn accent makes it hard to concentrate
<Quick_Thinker> the first one
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and not a single girl on that crowd
<Vordox> inb4 someone shoots Yugi and wins the world
<ASoftFluffyThing> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, except for Tea
<Quick_Thinker> im still confused why no one wants TO STEAL THEM
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 pointless 3 minutes of movie
<Dark92Enigma> Still no luck, keep trying!
<adasdad> nice job just shouting that
<Combustiblelemons> lets shout it out real loud so everyone can hear
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ASoftFluffyThing the dueling nerd crowd not yugi's friends
<Lil_B> AJIsAwesome but we are still in the 90 first pointless minutes
<Vordox> nobodies
<Panda> wait a second... what movie is gonna be playing?
<Quick_Thinker> YOUR A NOBODY JOEY WHEELER AND TRISTON UHHHHHHH
<Meanwhile> Nobody^4
<TrixieMuffins> is that a mexican wrestler in the crowd ?
<Combustiblelemons> brooklyn rage~
<pony_300> Quick_Thinker: well at least in this series there is a reason people don't steal from yugi: the pharoah will fuck them up
<GabeMoist> wat?
<adasdad> SO MUCH PUNS
<Saigneur> i don't get it
<LordDerpington> Best. Dialogue. Ever.
<Combustiblelemons> BROOKLYN RAGE.
<CriticKitten> XD
<Bogy> :D
<Dark92Enigma> oH, Everyone will get the GODFATHER reference!
<DerpyMuffins> The dialogue
<Quick_Thinker> THAT WAS TERRILE
<Vordox> ....
<Marx> :D
<Vordox> So bad
<Wirisme> whywhywhywhy
<AJIsAwesome> Upgrade your deck, Joey. -_-
<SteveCharb> puns aren't funny, mayor
<alexxm> wow this dub is bad
<Marx> Oh dear.
<Sumica> 00,10damn those things must be heavy
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<pony_300> after this series however, wh ynobody ever beats the shit out of the main character and steal their cards I dunno. Here, the pharoah might mindcrush you. In the other series... dunno.
<CriticKitten> ....
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> See not a single girl
<Combustiblelemons> WHAT.
<Quick_Thinker> HELLO NUR OWWW
<Saigneur> sexy
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hoh my god her wee we go again
<Nyst> Welp.
<Vordox> OH MAI
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> GET ON WITH IT
<RainbowAsh> Those things at the sides are holo-projectors? Did they have those in Egypt as well?
<Dark92Enigma> Quick_Thinker: Mr. Freeze: The Ice man cometh! Kick some ice! Can you be cold? Freeze! Chill. Ah, cool party! Stay cool.
<GabeMoist> Hellooooooo Nurse
<Vordox> OH OH OH OH MAAAAI!
<Vordox> NUN FETISH GO!

<Dark92Enigma> HELLOOOOOOOO NURSE
<Combustiblelemons> that... that uh.... what?
<AJIsAwesome> What was with the grunting..........:S
<Nyst> So...cards can physically hurt others?
<Dark92Enigma> THE HELL?
<FlaschenJoe11> you can't attack during the first turn
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, GilDash. :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Say "ah" use a needle
<Quick_Thinker> JUST KEEP SAYING SHIT
<ASoftFluffyThing> God. Joey is so horrible that he loses to little kids.
<Quick_Thinker> it will eventually make sense
<Quick_Thinker> dude he lost to a bug trainer
<Vordox> CHARMANDER
<LordDerpington> Guildford?
<ASoftFluffyThing> inb4 NEGATED
<Lil_B> ASoftFluffyThing He lost the battle, not the war :P
<Dark92Enigma> Quick_Thinker: there's no difference between the dialogue in these movies.......they're HAMMY AS HELL
<Quick_Thinker> DUMMY
<adasdad> idiot
<alexxm> a luchordor?
<Combustiblelemons> *applauds*
<Wirisme> :D
<Dark92Enigma> A LUCHADOR?
<AJIsAwesome> So basically there was no point of those duels? :S
<Quick_Thinker> BLACK FRIDAY ALL OVER AGAIN
*Dark92Enigma IT'S BEEN A HARD DAY'S NIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!
<EspyLacopa> Quick, Tea, bring Yugi to the one place noone ever goes
<EspyLacopa> THE MUSEUM!
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome, nope.
<Quick_Thinker> YEP AJ ARENT YOU HAPPY TO HEAR IT
<adasdad> shave your head, NOONE WILL RECOGNIZE YOU!
<Lil_B> they would never look in a place for intellegence!
<Nyst> Could he be any gayer?
<AJIsAwesome> Not just yet~ ;)
<Quick_Thinker> GENUS
<Dark92Enigma> THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE HAMMY CHARACTER IN THIS MOVIE…..!
<TrixieMuffins> I play the fanservice card
<CrimsonPhoenix> CHAOS
<Quick_Thinker> TOON WORLD QU ROGAR RABBIT
*pinkiespice stares at the vast collection of yugioh card
<Combustiblelemons> he looks like mr white from venture bros.
<Reactor> Discord?
<Kotano> a world of pain!
<AJIsAwesome> A world of Discord!
<adasdad> CHAOS!
<LordDerpington> wat
<CriticKitten> A world that can be easily destroyed in the actual game!
<Quick_Thinker> WHO FRAMED ROGAR RABBIT
<Meanwhile> Pegasus and his bloomin' Toon deck.
<ASoftFluffyThing> There's no ponies.
<pony_300> I guess the one advantage of GX over this is that Yuma is more proactive. That's about the only point I'll give to that otherwise horrid series.
<Saigneur> play toon is very dangerous, because if you don't pick the toon world, all your deck is useless
<ASoftFluffyThing> Not a legit card.
<Vordox> You know what's sad, Sumica ... This is a % game... "ESport with %" <--- Guess what... Boring =P
<Combustiblelemons> *yawn*
<Nyst> Those 'shadow monsters' don't really look too threatening.
<pinkiespice> they need to make more toon cards
<Dark92Enigma> Quick_Thinker: Not that toon world, God knows it's more entertaining than this movie, though
<Quick_Thinker> TIME TO DO A BS STRATUGY
<AJIsAwesome> EPIC MUSIC FOR JUST PUTTING A CARD DOWN! SO EPIC!
<EspyLacopa> That's because it doesn't have enough Exodia. Or Motorcycles.
<Meanwhile> Oh wait a minute I know...before I've even drawn the card...
<EspyLacopa> Exodia on motorcycles?
<Nato> Wooow....creepy background...but i love the creepy things, oh yea..Hi
<Dragon1029> what are the rules of these battles? This is REALLY confusing!!
<Quick_Thinker> why show the cards its more fun to be surprised
*Dark92Enigma Green Goblin: What about my generous proposal? Are you in, or are you out?
<CriticKitten> Fanservice girl!
<Alchemist> dafuq
<AJIsAwesome> Kaiba boy count: 3.
<Saigneur> motorcycle xD the last generation sucks so much
<pony_300> Exodia... motocycles.... a plot that doesn't make you want to slit your throat...
<Vordox> SO MUCH LOLI AND BISHOUNEN
<Saturn> 08,01DARK MAGICIAN WITH BOOBIES!
<Sumica> 00,10exposison latter we are on a time budget
<J_E_Smith71> World of Chaos and the Toon Card makes everything strange, it really is the Discord card
<Quick_Thinker> Dragon WELL GUESS WHAT THEY NEVER EXPLAIN SO GET USED TO IT
<adasdad> PLOT TWIST
<Saigneur> OP
*Dark92Enigma Spider-Man: It’s you who’s out, Gobby! Out of your mind!

<EspyLacopa> What if you combined the two, J_E_Smith71?
<PeachStreak> i just came up with a innapropriate TwilightSparkle name
<AJIsAwesome> Kaiba Boy Count: 4.
<Nato> whaaaat?
<Quick_Thinker> and suddentl the attack freezes
<Marx> Cue the pic.
<PeachStreak> anypony want to know it?
<CriticKitten> It's like a magnet. How does it work?
<Vordox> Oh shit
<AJIsAwesome> PeachStreak: Sorry, no thanks.
<Quick_Thinker> also by the way in the show pegasuss is like 25
<Vordox> ALL PAYBACK
<Meanwhile> Snug.
<Dark92Enigma> Quick_Thinker: THAT'S RIGHT! Cartoons are violent! (drinks from a skull-cup while shooting at random)
<AJIsAwesome> Y U NO SPLIT UP? :S
<Saturn> 08,01what? why wouldn't he?
<Vordox> SO
<Vordox> MUCh
<Vordox> FETISCH
<CriticKitten> She's like "hawt!"
<PeachStreak> AJIsAwesome: ok but it is funny and clever
<Dark92Enigma> THREESOME <---
<Combustiblelemons> Whatttt.
<Quick_Thinker> EYE THING GO
<alexxm> well that was pointless
<Alister> Why are we watching this again ?
<cowvarkian> and then kill them
<pony_300> why did they have to put Kaiba in such a weird denial about magic? It gets seriously ridiculous further into the series
<DerpyMuffins> Really?
<EspyLacopa> 5!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Alister, because Euro Brony Movie Night
<Dark92Enigma> PeachStreak: I don't think so
<Quick_Thinker> becuase Alister me and Dark are your official critics
<AJIsAwesome> PeachStreak: It's not really my thing.
<Saturn> 08,01this is a really fucking complicated game
<EspyLacopa> That's another Kaiba-boy
<cowvarkian> Alister: because someone chose it because they thought it wouldnt get chosen
<EspyLacopa> Another
<Combustiblelemons> Bring them back so you can sacrifice them. of course.
<Saigneur> love this tiny dragon ^^
<Vordox> BLUE EYES TOON DRAGON COME ON!?

<EspyLacopa> 6
<Saturn> 08,01Dark92Enigma: life points, i'd expect
<AJIsAwesome> Kaiba Boy Count: 6.
<Nato> everypony loves the chocolate, right?
<Soulero> noone says that
<Quick_Thinker> oh yeah by the way YOU CANT SUMMON 2 MONSTERS IN THE SAME TURN
<cowvarkian> HAHAHA
<PeachStreak> Dark92Enigma: what do u think it is
<Reactor> Parkour?
<Saturn> 08,01i thought MTG was confusing...
<cowvarkian> silliest laugh
<Lil_B> Saturn actually no, I think less than 10 basic rulkes, everything else is "this special cards can do this "etc which stand on every card what they do
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Quick_Thinker ultimate offering
<CriticKitten> Quick_Thinker: Ultimate Offering. :p
<Saturn> 08,01actually, MTG isn't all that confusing
<BladedWings> i still play this :D
<Dark92Enigma> Quick_Thinker: EVERYONE IN THIS MOVIE CHEATS
<Quick_Thinker> at least their kind enough to explain the cards
<Combustiblelemons> This... is confusing.
<Quick_Thinker> SUPER CHEAP STRATIGY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<cowvarkian> Quick_Thinker: for the kids
<CriticKitten> This is a stupidly convolted strategy, Kaiba.
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: that's why i write down the points
<Soulero> horey shit
<cowvarkian> Quick_Thinker: even though their cheating horribly
<EspyLacopa> Transformers!
<Combustiblelemons> *scratches head*
<cowvarkian> *they're
<EspyLacopa> Robots in disguise. . .
<pony_300> Quick_Thinker: Kind of the point of this entire series I think. to teach the players the game is a fun manner I think
<DerpyMuffins> This si cheating so much
<Lil_B> but yes... someone who sees this for the first time... THIS is confusing xD
<TrixieMuffins> Assemble Voltron!
<Saigneur> i had this card X Y Z <3
<Dark92Enigma> OH MY GOD, IT’S A DECEPTICON, RUN FOR YOUR LIFES!!!!!!

<EspyLacopa> Saturn: Sure it's broken, if you ignore all the rules.
<Vordox> NO
<Saigneur> toon world also suck for this ^^
<Vordox> LOLI
<Vordox> NOOOOO
<CriticKitten> The original TCG was broken as fuck
<SteveCharb> isn't tara strong dark magician girl?

<Reactor> Could you kill someone with this game?
<Dragon1029> I SEE WHAT HE DID THERE!
<Quick_Thinker> how come when evver you lose it loooks like it hurts
<SteveCharb> or am I thinking of something else?
<Dark92Enigma> CUE LOONEY TUNES THEME
<BladedWings> poor Pegasus :(
<Chrysalis> Saturn yup[
<Alchemist> wouldnt it be easier to just walk across the room and punch him in the face?
<Saigneur> CriticKitten: as hell yeah xD
<Lil_B> therte can be only one Kaiba!
<Lil_B> there*
<cowvarkian> Alchemist: yeah, but who needs easy
<EspyLacopa> Alchemist: You're thinking Season Zero.
<PeachStreak> and then XYZ-Dragon Cannon
<RainbowAsh> So when you win a match, you can just take any number of cards from your opponent?
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: this is a TERRIBLE example of the Yu-gi-oh universe
<cowvarkian> RainbowAsh: sure
<alexxm> but didn't the people who found it get trapped in there
<pony_300> Reactor: they have duels where losers are killed by real traps.... but I don't think the actual duel itself can kill you.... yea I don't get it either
<Iwa> RainbowAsh: Well, actually only the strongest
<SteveCharb> hearing beauty and the beast in my head right now
<Dark92Enigma> RainbowAsh: When established, yes
<Meanwhile> I'd say any example is a bad one as far as YuGiOh is concerned.
<Saturn> 08,01Dark92Enigma: stop defending YuGiOh
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma: yugioh is a terrible example of the yugioh universe
<Saturn> 08,01:P
<EspyLacopa> I know in the manga, Yami/Pharoah/whatever is downright evil at first.
<Quick_Thinker> okay does anyone rember if the rest of the cast (joey triston and tea) know of yugi's alter ego?
<Lil_B> the Mummy is the Villian!

<AJIsAwesome> Eeyup
<BladedWings> Dark92Enigma: no, keep defending it...i support it lol
<Saigneur> eeyup
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: i never said i was defending THIS FUCKER OF A MOVIE <---------
<TrixieMuffins> has he touched a fireflower ?
<Dark92Enigma> EEEEEEEEEYUP
<ASoftFluffyThing> Why does he carry that heavy-ass thing around his neck all the time?
<Kotano> Quick_Thinker They figure it out eventually
<RainbowAsh> MTG used to have something similiar in early editions, but no one ever wanted to play that way.
<cowvarkian> I like the abridged series better
<Reactor> I used to watch the show when it was on, but I don't remember any of the "rules" of the game.
<cowvarkian> it makes fun of the show wonderfully
<Quick_Thinker> yeah me and Dark are ripping this movie
<Lil_B> TrixieMuffins XD
<pony_300> hah who doesn't
<ASoftFluffyThing> You think someone would break in his house and steal it a few times.
<Dark92Enigma> YES, that's why they're keeping it in a MUSEUM WHERE EVERYBODY COULD STEAL IT
<CriticKitten> That's a really bad riddle.
<Quick_Thinker> cant ^ yami will fuck them up and "steal" their soul
<Lil_B> SPACEEE
<SteveCharb> ZUUL

<Quick_Thinker> RANDOM CHANTING IS CREEPY RANDOM CHANTING IS CREEPY
<cowvarkian> niktu
<Fl00t4hSh41> That was nearly as bad as Evil Dead where the monster is summoned by a tape recording
<Saturn> 08,01NIK*cough cough cough*
<pony_300> honestly, this movie is in some ways better than the actual end of the series.
<GilDash> Right, that made total sense.
<Lil_B> COATL!
<Saigneur> angel bunny
<cowvarkian> Saturn: I said it first hah
<AJIsAwesome> Pyramid thing? Really?
<Saigneur> that's not us, we promise <_<
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: yeah, really
<Dark92Enigma> The dialogue..............OMG the dialogue is killing me
<Lil_B> ohey GilDash :)
<Quick_Thinker> AND YET THEY DONT SUSPECT the 3 peolpe who were NEXT TO IT THAT THEY ARE SUSPECTS
<Saturn> 08,01how old is Yugi meant to be?
<GilDash> Lil_B: Holla! :)
<Dark92Enigma> TOLD YOU THEY'LL STEAL IT...........DUMBASS
<cowvarkian> Saturn: generic teenager age
<Fl00t4hSh41> Sorry Saturn I don't think Gort is on a rampage
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Early teens?
<Quick_Thinker> WORST...POLICE ...EVER
<ASoftFluffyThing> Saturn, he looks 13-ish
<MadSurge> Saturn: college old :D
<Combustiblelemons> 14?
<Combustiblelemons> i'd guess 14
<pony_300> infact the end of yugioh is like if you stretched this movie out 20 episodes
<Saturn> 08,01why isn't his voice all squeaky then?
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: 15
<Quick_Thinker> yu gi is supposed to be 11
<Lil_B> Saturn the boy about a naormal teen, his other from... 3000 old Pharao
<AJIsAwesome> LOOGIE!
<cowvarkian> Saturn: because then we would hate him
<FlaschenJoe11> Saturn: I would say between 15 and 18
<Quick_Thinker> at the beginning at lwast he was 11
<Saturn> 08,01shut up mokuba.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Saturn, that pyramid does something to his voice when he goes into dueling moe.
<cowvarkian> Saturn: and my voice wasnt squeaky when i was 13
<GilDash> Can't you explain all that in the car?
<DerpyMuffins> Is Mokuba a boy or girl?
<DerpyMuffins> It was never clear
<cowvarkian> DerpyMuffins: yes
<FlaschenJoe11> DerpyMuffins: boy
<Saturn> 08,01Dark92Enigma: yes
<Saturn> 08,01whoops
<Saigneur> mah boy !
<AJIsAwesome> Fart joke? Really? :S
<pony_300> Tristan, FULL OF HAM

<Fl00t4hSh41> cowvarkian: Yes it was, you mom lied to you
<Dark92Enigma> This is CLICHE
<adasdad> yugi sounds exactly like dipper pines
<Dark92Enigma> THIS IS YOUR ASS
<BladedWings> Dark92Enigma: yea...yea we did -_-
<Combustiblelemons> noone cares about Mokuba.
<Quick_Thinker> triston and Joey THE COMIDIC WALKING PUNCHLINES
<Saigneur> AJIsAwesome: yeah a very bad joke xD
<Dragon1029> TOILET HUMOR FTW
<cowvarkian> Fl00t4hSh41: well, then everyone that I ever met lied to me too
<Quick_Thinker> actually in the first season i honestly cared about Mokuba only becuase she was kidnapped
<Fl00t4hSh41> cowvarkian: Says a lot about your social circle, no?
<pony_300> Joey says he smells trouble and Tristan says it's him. Tristan is saying he smells like trouble! ThIS IS SO CLEVAR!!!
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: No problem
<RainbowAsh> What is happening right now?
<adasdad> he kept the his most vaulable cards ever on an exposed pouch on his waist? lol seems legit
<cowvarkian> Fl00t4hSh41: and I purposefully changed my voice so I wouldnt sound like an annoying, squeeky, 13 year old
<Dark92Enigma> THAT'S THE MOVIE'S PACING, don't blame me
<Quick_Thinker> NO CLUE JUST ROLL WITH RainbowAsh
<FlaschenJoe11> yes. let's cheat
<DerpyMuffins> They sure look alike dont they?
<ASoftFluffyThing> What the hell does YuGiOh mean, anyways?
<Quick_Thinker> great Facial expressins
<Quick_Thinker> its his name

<flutterchu> http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110706053628/battlefordreamisland/images/3/39/Crazybubble.png
<Lil_B> ...
<ASoftFluffyThing> All that money spent on a fucking DUELING ARENA. Just do it in the street or someone's house and be done with it.
<Quick_Thinker> AHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHA
<ASoftFluffyThing> It's not that hard.
<pony_300> that make no fuckin sense.
<Lil_B> this was horrible movie... you should be ashamed
<DerpyMuffins> Dat computer
<Dark92Enigma> RainbowAsh: FOR what i can tell, thanks to the Millennium Puzzle, he can contact the Pharaoh
<Fl00t4hSh41> How do the arena simulate cards that have never been used before?
<Starlight_Phoenix> all the simulations he could have done cant beat bullshit top decking
<Combustiblelemons> subtitles missed absolutely
<Reactor> Well, I wish I could stay, but I'm going to dinner. Bye, everyone!
<cowvarkian> Fl00t4hSh41: magic
<GilDash> I've been here for all of 20 minutes and I can already tell this makes no sense and watching everything beforehand would not have helped at all. :D
<RainbowAsh> Dark92Enigma, I see.
<Quick_Thinker> Fl00t its kind of a holgram
<BladedWings> why seal the exits!?
<Quick_Thinker> SEAL ALL DA EXTIS
<Lil_B> youdontsay.jpeg
<Saturn> 08,01CrimsonPhoenix: i guess
<Combustiblelemons> Shut up and kill my cards.
<Fl00t4hSh41> cowvarkian: How do the holographic systems know what to show when the cards have never been used before?
<Quick_Thinker> also what if the janator was in one of the hallways and got seald in I WOULD SUE KAIBA's ASS
<Saturn> 08,01maye the best! pet! win!
<Dark92Enigma> why people think Yugi is the greatest duelist ever JUST BECAUSE OF THE GOD CARDS? Maybe the narrator from before forgot to mention that Yugi defeated Kaiba became King Of Games, by defeating none other than Pegasus to save his Grandpa! AND WITHOUT THE GODDAMN GOD CARDS! Yeah, forgot to tell us that, you jackass!
<DerpyMuffins> Kiba is really obsessed about this card game
<TrixieMuffins> Alle Enrances are still open!
<cowvarkian> Fl00t4hSh41: they make something up?
<cowvarkian> Fl00t4hSh41: I don't know, magic
<Lil_B> I start bacause I said so!
<Quick_Thinker> EPIC GUTAR REMIX GO
<Combustiblelemons> some half assed subtitles here
<cowvarkian> Fl00t4hSh41: the holograms are what make the things, not the cards
<Quick_Thinker> head bang card activate
<Lil_B> Saturn that's... actually a good Tagline for this show XD
<Dark92Enigma> Combustiblelemons: JUST When i thought the dub was shitty enough
<Cypresswolf> Kaiba beats Yugi OME TIME and Yugi's career is over? ....:D
<Starlight_Phoenix> in the show who makes the cards for duel monsters?
<cowvarkian> Cypresswolf: sure
<Combustiblelemons> it's just hammy all round huh Dark92Enigma
<Quick_Thinker> i wonder if we did get someone rich enough if they will make holgrams for pokemon :D
<cowvarkian> Starlight_Phoenix: pegasus
<Saigneur> OP
<Dark92Enigma> Cypresswolf: Basically yes
<cowvarkian> *pegasis
<DerpyMuffins> Dat cheating
<cowvarkian> bah spelling
<Saigneur> LYRAMID
<Quick_Thinker> he just said Chant
<pony_300> funny how many times yugi has pulled the king/queen/jack knight combo, and people in the series are almost always surprised by it
<Quick_Thinker> HE JUST SAID HE WAS CHANTING
<Dark92Enigma> Combustiblelemons: yes, but at least they try to SHUT UP
<Vordox> BAD MOVE
<cowvarkian> slifer no slifing
<Dark92Enigma> why people think Yugi is the greatest duelist ever JUST BECAUSE OF THE GOD CARDS?
<Fl00t4hSh41> That has to be the silliest name for a dragon I've ever heard
<TrixieMuffins> Slifer , the executive producer
<Saigneur> 20% cooler than any other card
<Lil_B> the oods oi summoning that so fast = 1/infinity
<Combustiblelemons> indeed... there's like no quiet moments to gather thoughts.
<Dark92Enigma> SLIFER.......THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
<ASoftFluffyThing> SLIFER, NO SLIFING
<GabeMoist> Slifer no slifing
<ASoftFluffyThing> SLIFER THE FOX
<pony_300> Slifer, the exploitable reason he loses his final duel in the series!
<Quick_Thinker> SLIFER THE SLUT XD
<pony_300> well, part of it
<Lil_B> I think they made up new Cards just for this moviue
<GilDash> Hang on... is that Brock's VA?
<Quick_Thinker> wait yu gi loses a duel
<J_E_Smith71> And here we come to the final duel that takes up the rest of the movie
<J_E_Smith71> GilDash: Yep
<Quick_Thinker> WHEN
<BladedWings> Lil_B: some cards yes
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: Yes they were
<pony_300> Lil_B: pretty sure this movie is mostly a marketing move yea
<GilDash> Knew there was something about his voice...
<cowvarkian> so, what, do the cards now have some sort of magical properties?
<Quick_Thinker> yep
<Dark92Enigma> J_E_Smith71: THE REST OF THE MOVIE...........it's NOTHING BUT FIGHTING
<Quick_Thinker> IT S LIKE POKEMON :D
<adasdad> how does his cape stay up?
<Quick_Thinker> CEPT WORSE
<doctor_whooves127> winged dragon of ra has 0 atk right now
<Dragon1029> DU DU DUNNNNNNNNNN
<Fl00t4hSh41> What does that card actually do?
<cowvarkian> I thought that the grey haired gay guy made them up...
<Lil_B> I'm quite knowledgable in YuGiOh as an Anime, watched a lot of it because the Airtime was just riught :/
<Vordox> BULLSHIT
<Tassadork> o.0
<Quick_Thinker> CHANTING GO
<J_E_Smith71> Dark92Enigma: Well there a few interludes where they are trapped in the thing we summons later
<Lil_B> Vordox of Course!
<J_E_Smith71> But other than that yeah
*Vordox scribbles down his own card and on it says "The player using this card wins."
<Vordox> I WON
<Kimori> Thats pretty awesome though, its not a total loss
<Quick_Thinker> love how kabi gives no fucks a lazer is going through his miilion dollar dome
<J_E_Smith71> Or the thing he just summoned
<Combustiblelemons> Looks like the rules... Just screwed you.
<cowvarkian> hah, rules
<RainbowAsh> So basically, yugi has to play with the same cards as everyone else for once
<GabeMoist> card games are srs bsns
<cowvarkian> what are those
<cowvarkian> rules
<Dragon1029> OVERKILL!
<Dark92Enigma> cowvarkian: There are several types of cards......Monsters, Trap, Magic, Fusion, and God Cards
<Quick_Thinker> love how kabi gives no fucks a lazer is going through his miilion dollar dome
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma: no, I was saying that because they barely even follow the rules in this show
<Combustiblelemons> sounds like jabba the hutt
<Dark92Enigma> cowvarkian: the Monsters have as much subtypes as the Pokemon's
<Dark92Enigma> cowvarkian: oh
<Lil_B> Quick_Thinker it's only a light Sinmulation, nothing real :P
<adasdad> couldn't someone just make up a card that wins them the game but say "oh no this is legit i found it in an egyptian pyramid!"
<Combustiblelemons> ghost time!
<Dark92Enigma> OMG ITS SAURON!!!!!!!! RUN FOR YOUR LIFES
<Vordox> WELL
<Vordox> SATO IS A MURDERER

<Combustiblelemons> i can't comprehend these rules.
<Amu-chan> How're you doing?
<Starlight_Phoenix> did he just sack his paladin for blue eyes?
<RainbowAsh> Kotano, he didn't say he would though
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons: hah, rules
<Dark92Enigma> BladedWings: i once won a friendly tournament, BY USING THE THREE GOD CARDS
<Kotano> so this move was one of the few legit ones
<Lil_B> Vordox because fuck da Police, they are in a goddamn light Pyramid!
<adasdad> NEONS
<ASoftFluffyThing> This makes me not want to attempt YuGiOhfor a second time.
<FlaschenJoe11> Vordox: Paladin of White Dragon allows him to exchange the Paladin for a Blue-Eyes

<cowvarkian> Fl00t4hSh41: I'm sure
<adasdad> YAY HE LOIBES!
<BladedWings> i like that music for Peten
<Dark92Enigma> Quick_Thinker: Trope: Calling Your Attacks.
<Combustiblelemons> Damn mimes.
<pony_300> Yugi's advantage has always been that Duel Monsters is a broken mess of a game he could exploit the hell out of.
<adasdad> LIVES!
<ASoftFluffyThing> How many cards does he have, 20-something
<eleanorawesome> screw the rules
<adasdad> the fun has been trippled!
<cowvarkian> wait... but he can defeat 3
<Dark92Enigma> ASoftFluffyThing: 52 EACH one
<GilDash> Please tell me this is all being made up.
<Quick_Thinker> man luna is gonna be pissed
<Saigneur> 40 technically
<Saturn> 08,01i'm actually really enjoying this
<cowvarkian> Saturn: >.>
<adasdad> FUS RO DAH!
<GilDash> 'Cause this makes no sense at all.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Why does Seto constantly summon King Ghidora?
<GabeMoist> This game is rediculous
<Biggysweet> SCREW THE RULES I HAVE MONEY!!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dark92Enigma, Ohhh.
<Vordox> Saturn: Enjoying but going "Feck OP"
<cowvarkian> Saturn: enjoying laughing at it?
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: As in a cheesy way?
<Saigneur> but they have something like 100 if you look every episod
<Kotano> Saturn me too.It's a guity pleasure for me
<Dark92Enigma> SCREW THE RULES, I'M MAKING THEM!
<Fl00t4hSh41> Does he want Godzilla to interfere in the duel or somethiung?
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S SAURON MOTHERFUCKER
<Lil_B> Saturn I know, it's something about the fact that none of this makjes any sense whatsoever mnakes it really enjoyable
<Saigneur> and they have really often the good one
<cowvarkian> did he say millenium asshole?
<Dark92Enigma> PYRAMID SEX?
<Saigneur> ...
<Nyst> They're going to have baby cubes
<Combustiblelemons> not ruling it out Dark92Enigma
<Biggysweet> Yugi cheats because he makes someone else fight his duels
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dark92Enigma, dohoho
<RainbowAsh> They are up against Caramel
<Combustiblelemons> In this game, anything goes.
<TrixieMuffins> Lord of the Dance ?
<Dark92Enigma> cowvarkian: Insert NO clip right here :D
<Quick_Thinker> did yugi (not yama) ever fight anyone beside in shadow games or season 1?
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma: I just heard it, I didnt want it
<pony_300> yea, this movie actually isn't too bad compared to the OTHER Yugioh movie, which was cheesy as hell... and included Jaden Yuki. ._.
<Dark92Enigma> *GASP* FORESHADOWING
<Combustiblelemons> so it can see things in the future unless someone already saw something that was going to happen?
<Kotano> pony_300 that one was pure fanservice
<cowvarkian> Combustiblelemons: sure
<FlaschenJoe11> Quick_Thinker: He thought the Pharao in the Final Episodes
<Combustiblelemons> my head hurts from this.
<FlaschenJoe11> *fought
<Amu-chan> Not sick, which is good. XD
<Biggysweet> This show made more sense when i was 8
<Quick_Thinker> so he fought yama i thought he was a good guy
<pony_300> Kotaro: It certainly reeked of it. Seeing those three together should've been much better than what we got
<Fl00t4hSh41> What exactly is the Pyramid of Light card supposed to do?
<eleanorawesome> Can't he just surender?
<cowvarkian> Biggysweet: everything did
<RainbowAsh> Yugi could just forfeit the game
<Quick_Thinker> me too Biggy me too
<adasdad> can't pharoah just not do anything sao his turn lasts forever?
<Dragon1029> Is it me or does he sound like Brock from Pokemon?
<pony_9937> fave card
<GabeMoist> Dragon1029, same VA
<Quick_Thinker> nope RainbowAsh cant in something called a shadow game you quit your soul is stolen
<Vordox> YAY
<Marx> Dragon1029: He does!
<Vordox> KAWAI DESU NE
<FlaschenJoe11> Quick_Thinker: It was the final DUel. The only way the Pharao could pass on was, if Yugi beat him in a duel.
<Combustiblelemons> Starting to think he has a fetish for that card.
<Biggysweet> OBLITERATE!!! wait no
<ASoftFluffyThing> If Yugi forfeits the game, would they both die?
<Marx> Dragon1029: And for some reason I never noticed that.
<Vordox> WOMEN

<Vordox> LOLIS and stuff
<RainbowAsh> Quick_Thinker, oh, ok.

<Meanwhile> Deeeeeeaaaaaaaad.

<Dark92Enigma> IT NEVER SHUTS UP! IT NEVER TAKES A BREAK!
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma: thats its horribly written?

<Quick_Thinker> oh GilDash when i first started being in this chat i had all kinds of meters eventually after my own little story arc they all blew up it was fun
<RainbowAsh> Lol

<Epicmetalfreak> hugs Lil_B back :D
<taoumi> it was on wikipedia. so it must be legit
<pony_300> and somehow slipped a special card into pegasus's deck...HOW? Oh wait Magic of course
<CriticKitten> Soulero: He didn't create the game, technically.
*Dark92Enigma Exposition, exposition RUSH IT OUT A.S.A.P.
<EspyLacopa> CriticKitten: Yea, but for Kaiba to admit that would also be admitting the whole mystical stuff is real.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Lil_B. :)
<CriticKitten> Soulero: The show later reveals that he actually basically stole the whole thing from an ancient Egyptian game. :P
<doctor_whooves127> stab him in the face
<Quick_Thinker> ^ now Dark if were are going to crtic it we ccant use the NCs jokes
<Soulero> well i wasnt really watching it cratorkid
<CriticKitten> EspyLacopa: He does, at the end of the series.
<Quick_Thinker> and now your OUT NUMBERED
<pony_300> one thing that seems funny is that this entire ordeal has been going on since Yugi put together that puzzle... yet everything only began afew days ago movie time
<Cades> nothing
<Biggysweet> Broklyn Rage
<Soulero> * CrimsonPhoenix
<Dark92Enigma> RainbowAsh: Insert Google and Wikipedia reference

<Soulero> pwd
<ASoftFluffyThing> >3 people
<RainbowAsh> Dark92Enigma, I withdraw my question.
<Soulero> pwnd
<EspyLacopa> CriticKitten: Yea, because it's whacked him in the head so many times He didn't really have a choice but to believe.
<Lil_B> which is in 1 min for me
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: Ah, I see.
<DerpyMuffins> Dat GX reference
<Soulero> ACK!
<CriticKitten> RainbowAsh: It was actual monsters and actual magic involved.
<RainbowAsh> CriticKitten, why aren't they now then?
<Quick_Thinker> enslavve the earth
<Nyst> Cards win against tanks huh?
<Fl00t4hSh41> But aren't the creatures themselves alive?
<Biggysweet> what is the point of this evil plan
<Combustiblelemons> Zuul did a better job at this.
<pony_9502> thank god he didn't show 5D
<Soulero> wow, talk about eye candy!
<Dark92Enigma> OK, join the Villains-who-go- little-to-no-screen-time Club (Venom, Darth Maul, and Bobba Fett)
<Soulero> wow, talk about eye candy!
<Quick_Thinker> also IF THE MILITARY GOT INVOLVED THEY WOULD ahem NUKE DAT SHIT
<Marx> Huh. Kinda like how pulling the Master Sword unleashes Ganon's powers. At least in Wind Waker.
<Amu-chan> Nothing really.
<Amu-chan> Hi Stormy!
<cowvarkian> <.<
<pony_300> Anubis's plan, free himself and shit gets REAL
<EspyLacopa> And I think in Kaiba's past life as Priest Seto, his hot girlfriend got turned into a duel monster: the Blue Eyes White Dragon
<alexxm|colt> crazy woman
<eleanorawesome> JUMP
<CriticKitten> RainbowAsh: Two reasons, an IC and an OOC. From the IC perspective, it's because the pharoah sealed the monsters into stone tablets. OOC, because card games sell well
<Combustiblelemons> JUMP!
<Soulero> what an idiot!
<adasdad> ppoor wording is poor

<Dark92Enigma> Quick_Thinker: Heart of the Cards is more powerful, but this is YU GI OH related of course someone will talk about friendship
<Amu-chan> I'm doing good. Feel kinda silly because I mistook my usual period symptoms for possibly getting sick yesterday because something's been going around. >->
<Azuredragon> Why isn't there a survival horror game with mummies?
<Quick_Thinker> Kaiba you have problems
<Lil_B> or maybe Stream as a constant Datastream doesn't turn off the Modem :/ anyway good for me :)
<DerpyMuffins> Kiba has some major problems
<doctor_whooves127> somethings not right im losing
<Stormy> ah, that happens to me all the time -.-
<Combustiblelemons> a gardener you say?
<Biggysweet> Kaiba just wants to be the best at a childrens card game
<Vordox> Payback = Destroying world
<Dark92Enigma> Quick_Thinker: by the way, now you know why i quoted the NC? to correct Combustiblelemons for one second

<Fl00t4hSh41> cowvarkian: I always new Irish people where all gay...
<DerpyMuffins> 1900 attack and higher cant attack him
<Quick_Thinker> Kaiba YOU HAVE SERIOUS ISSUES STOP AND LISTEN TO YU GI
<pony_300> wait, there's a card that would force you to rip up your own cards or somethin? Or is Kaiba just being extra dramatic?
<FlaschenJoe11> DerpyMuffins: Can't DESTROY him.
<cowvarkian> pony_300: yes
<IshBlueEyesWhitePony> Fl00t4hSh41 hey, I'm Irish and not gay
<Biggysweet> lol stream froze and lyra looked like she was a card on yugi's duel disk
<Lil_B> this inner dialoge had no point...
<RainbowAsh> So pegasus gave Kaiba the shiny dragon, but that doesn't look so great against the god cards, does it?
<Quick_Thinker> Pony_300 both
<Cades> Do you know of any websites I can upload some zip files to download them later?
<Dragon1029> DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!
<Fl00t4hSh41> IshBlueEyesWhitePony: Are you an elf?
<Amu-chan> It would also suck simply to get sick because I needed to do my laundry today.
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: he's arguing with Anubis, who possesed him
<Quick_Thinker> DO IT YOU WHIMP (in form of the 2 best sisters)
<ASoftFluffyThing> GODDAMIT KAIBA YOU IDIOT

<cowvarkian> more ambitious then ageless god...
<cowvarkian> seems legit
<DerpyMuffins> His ego is so big, a god cant control him
<pony_300> QUick_Thinker: I mean in reality. Can't see the manufacturer making a card that would dictate a person tearing up their own cards
<Biggysweet> King of games. Nice title
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma I know, but there isn't really a big struggle going on right now
<Fl00t4hSh41> IshBlueEyesWhitePony: Then clearly you are no Obnoxious Celtic Guardian
<cowvarkian> pony_300: I can
<RainbowAsh> pony_300, MTG did that.
<Quick_Thinker> and if Kabi did blow it up he would actuall be able to fofit (without the pryamid its not a shadow card game
<cowvarkian> pony_300: then they would buy more cards
<Saigneur> forget the rules
<Quick_Thinker> so no soul steal
<CriticKitten> Oh god, a naked man!
<EspyLacopa> Don'tlookathiscrotchDon'tlookathiscrotchDon'tlookathiscrotchDon'tlookathiscrotch

<Combustiblelemons> ?
<EspyLacopa> Fl00t4hSh41: Because magic
<Dark_Horst> this bitch aint no anubis
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dark92Enigma, I think I'd let Kaiba die for his stupidity.
<Lil_B> it's like a Native American + some Viking Armor Partsd
<Dragon1029> He_Man?!?!

<ASoftFluffyThing> Anubis, WHY NO DOG HEAD
<pony_300> ANUBIS WILL CRUSH YOUR PUZZLE AND HAIRCUT, HULK HOGAAAAAANNNNN
<cowvarkian> IshBlueEyesWhitePony: he's a god, why would he be conformed to a single form, he's not a mortal
<Dark92Enigma> Azuredragon: He's Venom AND Darth Maul

<mentallyeffedguy> i seriously cant watch this, its hurting my brain
<Meanwhile> So why did he not just start this whole giant monster thing by just vaporising everyone?
<CriticKitten> The card game is based on the real thing. Ergo, when the dark magics of a shadow game are invoked, the powers become "real".

<RainbowAsh> CriticKitten, I see

<Chrysalis> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/3/sKhETFjarUSvC-OsTcPt5g2.png
<pony_300> I'm thinking some of the cards are based off the old game, but Pegasus made more cards and added them to the game
<Dark92Enigma> OH, SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!! THIS ISN’T A MOVIE! THIS IS AN EXTENDED EPISODE, AN ABORTED STORY-ARC THAT SOMEHOW GOT A BUDGET!!!!!!!
<Meanwhile> And the moral of the story is...buy our cards.
<Lil_B> nope, everybody knows you buy Friends with Money
<CriticKitten> RainbowAsh: It's canon that shadow games activate the powers of the original Egyptian game, making the effects of the game real. It's fucking bizarre, yes, but it's canon in this universe so it works.
<Starchaser> i like this song
<Darf14> yay its over :)
<BladedWings> dat music :D
<Vordox> Saturn: I'm enjoying this with THIS company
<Quick_Thinker> NO ONONONO NO SHITTY songs
<Combustiblelemons> lame song time!
<Vordox> 10/10 of 1000/100 IMDB
<Starchaser> runs
<Azuredragon> OVER
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: \o/
<Quick_Thinker> also guys songs only get like 30 sec ans THEN NEXT SONG
<LordDerpington> I have never felt so old. I barely understood any of that.
<flutterchu> atleast tey all didnt laugh at the end
<Nyst> Solitaire/10
<Combustiblelemons> blue eyes shining dragon/10?
<Epicmetalfreak> yay! Credits xD
<RainbowAsh> CriticKitten, ok, but why didn't the other cards in their decks didn't help against that last monster?
<Bogy> "dear princess celestia - today I make a monstercard real..."
<Sweetie_Belle> it snowed here :)
<Bogy> xD
<Dragon1029> *claps* whelp, i'm off to bed. Night, everypony :D
<BladedWings> Vordox: yes, the chat made this more funny lol
<Dark92Enigma> As far as movies go, this is down right dissapointing. The animation is amazing, and there was some build-up to this point, but there was no substance. The plot is unbalanced, the dialogue is cliché, and it NEVER SHUTS THE FUCK UP! It’s the worst example of the Yu-Gi-Oh universe, only made with the purpose of selling more products. No more, no less………it’s still better than CARDGAMES ON MOTORCYCLES! 4,5/10
<Darf14> *hits mute and plays Jetset Radio music*
<ASoftFluffyThing> ALL THE CHEATING/10
<Fl00t4hSh41> So if the ancient egyptians made the cards and such, where do all the robot cards come from?
<Meanwhile> Anubis is the stupidest bad guy since the guys from Home Alone/10
<Marx> Okay, maybe not the best movie, but there's worse. 8/10
<Epicmetalfreak> gn8 Dragon1029
<DerpyMuffins> Hax/10
<Gandalf_the_Brony> 4Kids can go to hell/10
<Saturn> 08,017/10
<Lil_B> Noinsense/10
<pony_300> Dark92Enigma: Someone needs to enter the other yugioh movie into lottery
<Saturn> 08,01honestly, i enjoyed it
<Darf14> :O
<GilDash> I... actually can't believe how bad that was. XD
<Epicmetalfreak> weed/10
<Azuredragon> This MOVIE is one card short (ZING)
<LordDerpington> Well, I was only half watching. At least I got to finish my Dinky-Derpy picture while this was on.
<Chrysalis> oh wow
<Vordox> Same, I liked it, but only cause of this company going apeshit with me :D
<Quick_Thinker> i want to thank Dark92Engima for helping me with this and it was fun and anyone else who threw in thier own comments
<cachi01|phone> LOL I DIDNT WATCHED DA BUCKING MOVIE/pingas
<BladedWings> Kaiba is still a duch/10
<Starchaser> 5 for the movie 8 for the soundtrack
<IshBlueEyesWhitePony> Goddamn Loch Ness Monsta, I ain't givin' you tree fiddy/10
<Saturn> 08,01okay, maybe 6/10
<DerpyMuffins> 7.9/10 I thought it was funny
<Bogy> alright but I get it 7.5/10 it wasn't bad at all
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This movie was better the second time around.
<Bogy> ^^
<Lil_B> yeah, it IS an enjoyable movie, bnut for all the wrong reasons XD
<Fl00t4hSh41> Pegasus was funny, but the rest of annoying
<Chrysalis> 4.9GB patch for pS2
<IshBlueEyesWhitePony> Goddamn Loch Ness Monsta, I ain't givin' you tree fiddy/10
<ASoftFluffyThing> I don't think I want to attempt YuGiOh a second time afte thils/10
<Dark_Horst> i amused myself with the ungodly bad dub^^
<CriticKitten> RainbowAsh: Because Anubis was effectively godly at that point. So something that can destroy *any* monster was the best choice. Also because the Shining Dragon was a promo card.
<Saturn> 08,01i did enjoy the battles
<Sweetie_Belle> >_>
<Quick_Thinker> songs only get 30s then NEXT SONG
<BladedWings> nooooo, not a yugioh rap :[
<Vordox> Quick_Thinker: Of course, it's a law
<pony_300> Also, nothing will be better than Cardgames on pointless motorcycles!!! Lolol but srsly 5d's was good damnit. ;_;
<RainbowAsh> CriticKitten, ah, ok.
<Dark92Enigma> Quick_Thinker: what is your analysis?
<Combustiblelemons> can't say i hated it but can't say I liked it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, can you believe fluttercry wanted to put this in WMC?
<LordDerpington> So they can jam as many songs onto the soundtrack CD as possible.
<GabeMoist> That was fun
<Azuredragon> o great, cRAP
<Saturn> 08,01CrimsonPhoenix: DENIED
<Saturn> 08,01,3
<GabeMoist> Card games/10
<Saturn> 08,01*<3
<Lil_B> good think I have the Soundtrack -.-
<flutterchu> pony83073: nearly all the battles were on motorcycle's and usay one EVERY MATCH
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: as far as nomral episodes go, the battles were actually compressed... shlobbery goop
<Saturn> 08,01MOTORCYCLES/10
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. This is not WMC. It's a kid's flick.
<Lil_B> whats WMC?
<ASoftFluffyThing> I now know what I want to choose for B movie.....
<Starchaser> i had the soundtrack
<pony_300> 5d's had remotely likeable characters, and......................................................................................................................................... that's all you need to be better than any other yugiohs.
<Combustiblelemons> 4/10 for no quiet or slow moments
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's just trying a bit too hard to sell cards.
<Vordox> <... So many Korean names
<Quick_Thinker> my final thoughts 2/10 (rushed as can be, no intro for newcomers, ruel breaking up the ass, OP cards, bad script, funny, lines sometimes, and god the raps and puns) over all BAD
<Kotano> I have a DVD with two crappy AMV's on it
<Cades> hey
<Combustiblelemons> my brain can't comprehend a non stop action scene.
<Stormy> ._.
<pony_300> fakeass puffy daddy Come with Me song
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: well, yes
<Kjakings> 7Evening sirrah.
<EspyLacopa> 5d's had Jack and Yusei. And cardgames on motorcycles.
<Dark_Horst> i watched some episodes when this was first aired on tv. quote frankly, they were better in every aspect
<Applejack2012> I know my B movie choice too
<Saturn> 08,01that's kidn of the point
<CriticKitten> Yu-Gi-Oh revolves around this hammy crap. And in that regard, this movie is par for the course. That said, it's padded heavily and a bit more ridiculous than usual. Still, it's alright for what it was intended to do. It's probably 4 or 5 out of 10.
<Kjakings> 7fuck me it's a Stormy.
<pony_9502> 3 sacrificed shining dragons/10
<Stormy> hey Kjakings
<Saturn> 08,01and it's cute for that
<Kotano> they're apparently made by professionals
<BladedWings> ASoftFluffyThing: what?
<Azuredragon> http://ponybot.net/pix/4921.png
<ASoftFluffyThing> BladedWings, I NO TELL
<Dark92Enigma> pony_300 ok, it's a little better than GX, that's for sure
<Lil_B> Vordox now that you mention it :/
<Kjakings> 7Been a while.
<Saturn> 08,01it takes itself so seriously
<Tailsy> hello people

<Epicmetalfreak> hey Tailsy :D
<Quick_Thinker> what be this
<CrimsonPhoenix> Azuredragon, OH SNAP
<cachi01|phone> Ratings/Bronystate
<Saturn> 08,01which makes it enjoyable, if you suspend your disbelief at the "WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK"
<flutterchu> there will always be an unlimited amount of yu-gi-oh card's...........even 1st generation there still making............gotta catch them all, NOT
<BladedWings> ASoftFluffyThing: aaawww...you could pm it to me ^_^ i wont tell either ;)
<CriticKitten> Quick_Thinker: Problem with your assessment: it's EXACTLY like the show it was based on.
<Stormy> yeah, I decided to check in on Thursday
<Saturn> 08,01don't think about it too hard
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: still, you're better off with the actual series
<pony_300> Dark92Enigma: *thumbs up* .......... god I hate GX.
<Quick_Thinker> man your fast at framing sonic
<RainbowAsh> So... just for the sake of the argument, is any anime movie ok for B movie or was this one some kind of exception?
<Combustiblelemons> nice room azure.
<Darf14> No monsters were harmed during the making of this film...... except for Kuriboh
<Stormy> And what do you know, there were people in here
<Ponyloverforever> Ponies! :)
<Tailsy> oh yay ponies
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: i've never actually seen the series; i suspect i would also enjoy it

<prince-dari> Six months, I've not worked six months total in 7 years of school
<prince-dari> I worked maybe a single month for my AS levels and got all As in them. :P
<Sonny> anyway thank you guys so much! :D I didn't expect this much comments on a practice drawing ^^
<Dken2021> it's still a nice effort what you did
<Stormy> I never take school very seriously; I just do nothing and stuff works out
<LordDerpington> Sounds like a manageable learning curve.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> stuff works out
<Stormy> I like how this is a bragging session about being lazy :P

<AdamTheDuck> But I can press tab to auto-complete Quick_Thinker :3
<Lyra`> so, a guy just asked me if i want to come over tonight
<CrimsonPhoenix> STREAM IS OFFLINE

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy it was funny, i wish I could find it, it was on derpibooru, it looked like a mutilated flat pancake rarity
<CrimsonPhoenix> POST VIDEOS
<Cypresswolf> very rarely, most often the chime goes of on websites that have a funny pic via google search
<Lyra`> i responded: sure what are we going to do
<Quick_Thinker> true true
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i already have ice cream on my fridge
<cowvarkian> Lyra`: >.>
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but the seller was totally serious
<Paspie> Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V
<Dken2021> Lyra` for?
<Lyra`> his response was: hint, it involves pillows ;)
<Cypresswolf> then it just blocks access
<Ponyloverforever> has stream ended????
<Meanwhile> You keep icecream in the fridge?
<cowvarkian> Lyra`: pillow fight?
<d3rb> now im not sure if i've been hearing the stream ping or kaspersky Cypresswolf lol

<Meanwhile> Makes more sense.

<drphantom> Discord
<Quick_Thinker> sony umm i dont need a PS3 do i?
<cowvarkian> I need to play on wreks server...
<cowvarkian> *the server wrek's on

<Kjakings> 7Oh my a butterfly project journal.
<Bunny_Striker> I can fit my little bro`s clothes
<Chrysalis> PS2 is sort of closed beta atm
<cowvarkian> Chrysalis: I bought it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Can you fit into your little sister's clothes?
<Chrysalis> you can either buy it and get in
<Barbetos> Been streaming ps2 for long?
<Chrysalis> or people who have bought it get keys to distribute
<Stormy> I thought everyone knew of SFRB though
<cowvarkian> Nittany_Discord: >.>
<Bunny_Striker> Nittany_Discord: Nope,
<cowvarkian> Chrysalis: I bought it
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> i do

<Dken2021> Bunny_Striker depends, which hitler are we talking about? http://derpy.me/GfmHb
<Stormy> Well duh :P
<Kjakings> 7it sounded vaguely familiar.
<Kjakings> 7I haven't been on the forums in forever
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wut? I had to ask. :p
<Stormy> She's not on SF much
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> sf is basically dead
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> because the series is dead.
<Stormy> She's well-known for her fanart
<Stormy> Like Razz
<Meanwhile> Inb4 they hit by some kind of AA.
<Stormy> only less... how do I put this...
<drphantom> http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5306/5843071000_3298bc87dc.jpg
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I was going to get into drawing, because mlp style seems simple enough for me, but i still havent gotten around to it
<Kjakings> 7Razz?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> wasnt razz a nutcase?
<cowvarkian> brb, going to go take back a monitor
<Bunny_Striker> drphantom: lol
<Stormy> you guys really don't remember all that?
<Stormy> geez
<Bunny_Striker> and the chat went quiet...
<Stormy> Did you forget about Doppel and Ayumi too?
<Kjakings> 7No I was suggesting that 'less Razz' was a perfectly acceptable way to put it
<Kjakings> 7oh god I had forgotten Doppel until just now
<Stormy> Oh haha
<Stormy> Lol
<Dken2021> ...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Oh I know doppel was a nutcase
<Kjakings> 7... remember there was that guy, who was like eighteen and collected MLP, but this was before G4 so everyone just trolled the shit out of him?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They all got mental images of you in a dress Bunny_Striker.
<Kjakings> 7Pretty much everyone that did that is now a brony.
<Chrysalis> soon my download will finish
<Stormy> Oh yeah, Dragonmissioner
<Chrysalis> and i will "accidently" ram them with a fighter
<BaconMane> 0,5I have mental images of me in a dress
<killerpony7733> Wrek I'm trying to purchase the alpha squad thing but after pressing confirm purchase it does nothing
<Stormy> he came back to SF not too long ago and made a thread about looking for Razz
<Bunny_Striker> Nittany_Discord: oh
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> If you collect before G4 you deserve troll.
<Chrysalis> everyone has images of bacon in a dress
<Chrysalis> i mean
<Chrysalis> what
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I bet it's sexy BaconMane.
<BaconMane> 0,5THey're very sexy images indeed

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4882361_460s_v1.jpg
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I refuse to watch.
<Bunny_Striker> I now have a mental image of me in a dress with a moustache...
<Dken2021> lovely image Bunny_Striker
<pony_6651> And a monocle!
<flutterchu> i wonder if he can see oour chat's
<flutterchu> *our

<RedDragonX> such memories
<Stormy> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll put you to work cleaning my grandmother's house in a maid outfit Bunny_Striker.
<Stormy> Everything was so dramatic back then...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> My mom went with my little sister into this hippy produce store
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and my sister had taken my rainbow dash hat
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and this employee there was totally into it.
<drphantom> http://www.amazon.com/Little-Pony-SDCC-Derpy-Hooves/dp/B008LHYBF4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1349564959&sr=8-1&keywords=derpy+hooves
<Paspie> Yey! Just (FINALLY!) finished Season 1.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> my mom thought he was nuts and a pedophile.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I had to lol.
<Polydunami> You mean, for the first time?
<Bunny_Striker> Nittany_Discord: My brother dared me to wear a maid`s outfit last halloween
<flutterchu> this dude look's like if he got efed around....youre gonna die...(agian if you count me)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did you?
<Bunny_Striker> Nittany_Discord: yes
<drphantom> I did the ultimate brony challange
<Bronysith> oh hey Wrek has a yoke for flying
<Bunny_Striker> drphantom: listen to pinkie for 5 hours?
<Kjakings> 7haha
<pony_6651> Ultimate brony chalenge? (me:Noob)
<drphantom> no watch all of the MLP episodes in one day
<Stormy> I've never met anyone IRL who likes ponies
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: if you make a vid of cleaning the house while you are in a maid outfit i will pay you moneys
<Stormy> Except Lambduh
<Kjakings> 7sometimes on the bus back from school, there's this guy who's just decked out in pony gear.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How much?
<DocSane> I like how Wrek's donned his mirror shades for this.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I dont take it that far.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: how big is the house?
<Bunny_Striker> seeya
<Kjakings> 7Twilight Sparkle shirt, whichever pony around his neck, usually some kind of apple bloom hat.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cya Bunny_Striker.
<drphantom> http://cheezburger.com/6175200000
<Dken2021> laters bunn--oh
<Stormy> yeah at that point it starts to get creepy
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I probably wouldn't go to conventions or anything like that either
<pony_6651> see you later
<Ponyloverforever> who is streaming??
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Medium-sized. Don't know the square footage.
<Dken2021> Wreky is
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I say probably because I never did think id be into ponies either so....
<Bronysith> who is Wrek in skype with?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I can buy a few collectables for fun
<prince-dari> Spaghetticons
<Ponyloverforever> what country is wreky from?
<Bronysith> sweden
<prince-dari> Me and some other people want to go to one and throw spaghetti at people. :P
<Ponyloverforever> i think i saw that t shirt before...
<Rustymeat> oh shit what
<Bronysith> Hey who is wrek playing with?
<Stormy> I went to this con last year http://daishocon.com/ and tons of people were dressed up like MLP characters
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> is spaghetti thing a meme or something?
<Dken2021> no idea
<Polydunami> An aircraft, most likely :P
<AdamTheDuck> Isn't Wrek playing with Sumi?
<prince-dari> This is the origin
<Dken2021> too late, we know
<prince-dari> So basically spaghetti is just socially awkward stuff
<Quick_Thinker> oh god guys im not feeling so good i think i might get off my head is spining suddenly
<Quick_Thinker> bye
<Rustymeat> Oh no :(
<AdamTheDuck> .-. Get better Quick~
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> is it actual spaghetti he is talking about or is it some innudendo for something else
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> that i dont get
<AdamTheDuck> o.o Dat map
<Stormy> My friend who's a 4channer made some reference to that and expected me to get it
<Stormy> I just looked at him like 'wtf'
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I never visit 4chan
<Rustymeat> um
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> sometimes people link 4chan pics and thats all I see.
<naturesfury> to the ground!!!
<prince-dari> If you want a good example
<prince-dari> This youtube channel exists
<Kjakings> 7.... did you people get weirder in the intervening years or have the memories just softened?
<prince-dari> This one
<prince-dari> The looks in her eyes
<prince-dari> Oh my God. XD
<AdamTheDuck> brb~ I'm off to make some coffee
<Dken2021> you go do that ^_^
<Tickle_Me_Elmo> you know what this game needs? sprays.
<Stormy> I find it kind of creepy that he has the camera right in her face like that
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Kjakings I get weirder as I get older.
<Meanwhile> Pffft.
<Stormy> unlikely
<Kjakings> 7I got bored of that video a minute in
<Meanwhile> I know, I'll just jump to my death.
<drphantom> What game is this?
<prince-dari> Ok then
<prince-dari> Watch the first ten seconds of this then Kjakings: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxRCJri6v-A&feature=plcp
<cachi01|phone> Its half life 3
<Chrysalis> its PlanetSide 2 closed beta
<drphantom> this looks extremely familiar
<Kjakings> 7This is weird.
<cachi01|phone> Lol chat is ded
<drphantom> R.I.P. Chat
<Dken2021> huh, I'm having second thoughts of just purchasing white 2 from amazon when I could just go to a store tomorrow
<Kjakings> 7I like to pretend that all the creepy bronies don't actually exist
<Meanwhile> Well, tired of Planetside 2 gameplay ages ago. Ping me if he starts playing Game of Thrones or something.
<Barbetos> This is odd
<SafariMonkey> Is wrek streaming?
<Dken2021> mmhmm
<Stormy> sorry, but that's like 50% of the fandom
<Barbetos> I think I might be on the wrong server?
<Freefall29> chat has been resurrected
<Barbetos> You guys are on Esimir right?
<Kjakings> 7yeah.
<prince-dari> Hence spaghetticons
<cachi01|phone> White/Black 2 :I i wonder if its any good
<oni_link> That fist logo reminds me ALOT of the Bungie logo
<Dken2021> boom
<Kjakings> 7Despite having been a part of it, in this place, for several years I really find it difficult to stomach some of the more brutal and creepy aspects of the internet.
<MirrorImage> Wrek - looked more like they're trying to kamikaze you
<cachi01|phone> Wrek press z or r twice!
<Stormy> cEh
<killerpony7733> Can anyone help?
<Stormy> okay how did that c get in there
<Stormy> anyway
<MirrorImage> define "help"
<Barbetos> Wrek open you map for a second
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Theres parts of mlp fandom you don't want to know exist.
<Lyra`> wrek hasnt moved in a while.
<Barbetos> I may be on the wrong server, but you can still invite friends, squad, and outfit across them
<oni_link> Ill be back later :P
<Lyra`> find this distrubing
<Stormy> I've pretty much become desensitized to it...
<killerpony7733> I keep trying to god damn purchase alpha squad or just station cash it redirects me to my account management page
<killerpony7733> And it has no signs of confirming anything
<flutterchu> lights off > lights on
<killerpony7733> I'm god damn frustated now
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Like seriously, people need to tag their stuff properly because otherwise safesearch doesn't catch everything.
<cachi01|phone> Boink
<flutterchu> killerpony7733: im so sorry for making you mad i didnt mean toooOoOOOOoooo ;_;
<Stormy> I almost never get bad stuff in safesearch
<ekips> Oh, why didn't noone tell me that there is a PS2 session going on
<killerpony7733> flutterchu What? you didn't do anything
<flutterchu> killerpony7733: oh sorry i thought i did
<Bronysith> oh hey the recruit is on stream now
<Stormy> I got a nude picture like once or twice
<Kjakings> 7I used to be desensitised and I think I just limited myself to the slightly safer parts of the internet once this place died and that just got rid of it all.
<cachi01|phone> pawnch pawnch falcon pawnch
<Stormy> I think my problem is I need to stop wasting so much time on reddit
<drphantom> FALCOOOON PAWNCH PAWNCH pawnch

<LadyCanary> ....How can I describe it.
<DashWithRainbows> Saxy has some competition, me thinks.
<Cypresswolf> I miss all my funny cat moments - I never have a camera nearby when something happens - I got home one day to see my other cat, Spice, curled up with the tv remote

<Dark_Horst> brothers in arms.... i just couldnt get over the scene where the jagdpanther fled in reverse from a bunch of shermans
<DerpyMuffins> We gonna get a P3 show tonight?
<Stormy> because it's fun
<Dark_Horst> i meanr really... that would have been short work
<Allegr0> indeed DerpyMuffins, but it'll be short unfortunately
<DerpyMuffins> No Gigabit?
<Amu-chan> If I were an op, I'd be happy to kick you. It's been ages since I kicked someone from an IRC channel for no reason.
<Allegr0> DerpyMuffins giga had an emergency meeting for work :(
<Rustymeat> Gigabit is deeeead
<Stormy> :P
<Franek12354> Not again...
<Meanwhile> Our Giga is deeeeaaaad.
<Kimori> go for it :D
<Cades> haha
<Allegr0> not dead...just sleeping
<Rustymeat> WAKE HIM UP
<Stormy> for some reason I thought that being an oper I'd be able to make ChanServ do my bidding
<Stormy> but I guess not :(
<Kimori> What does it say when you try it?
<Allegr0> I can't...only love's true kiss can do tha
<Allegr0> that*
<Reikim> Are we on the podcast now?
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Allegr0
<Reikim> Or something
<drphantom> I just have on little question: How long will this go on?
<Reikim> I dunno
<Allegr0> hey AdamTheDuck
<LadyCanary> Oh myyy :3
<LadyCanary> Dat wub
<Meanwhile> I dunno, I turned stream off ages ago.
<Dark_Horst> forever
<Dark_Horst> quite literaly
<Franek12354> Allegr0: Therefore he is hybernated right?
<DerpyMuffins> Am I the only one that answers the weekly questions?
<Stormy> [19:57:14] --ChanServ-- You are not authorized to perform this operation.
<Dark_Horst> the battles in planetside 2 are endless
<Allegr0> Franek12354 ...sure, we'll go with that :P
<AdamTheDuck> More rocket launchers? Great idea~
<Franek12354> DerpyMuffins: Not only... :)
<DashWithRainbows> Allegr0 Giga doesn't sleep, for he is Gigabot 5000
<Allegr0> no DerpyMuffins, you're special but not that special ;)
<DerpyMuffins> lol
<Meanwhile> There are weekly questions?
<AdamTheDuck> What was the weekly question again?
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Pikachu> Hi bronies/ponies! :)
<Allegr0> indeed meanwhile :P
<AJIsAwesome> OH'
<DashWithRainbows> Bronies and ponies?
<Rustymeat> What is the weekly question?
<AJIsAwesome> NVM
<Reikim> Yeah, the weekly questions are a thing.
<thelonepony> hi Pikachu :3
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Pikachu
<DashWithRainbows> There are none here.
<Franek12354> DerpyMuffins: This makes sense, at least for Allegr0
<AJIsAwesome> I know what you're talking about. :D
<DerpyMuffins> Am I the only one that follows the P3 show?
<Reikim> Saxy's supposed to be posting them every week but he's been slacking. Also he isn't here right now because he's moved his energies to school.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Pikachu. :)
<Allegr0> anyone wanting the last question, make sure to check out the last post or two on the front page about the show :P
<Allegr0> Reikim, he's volunteered to do it for us, he's not required to, so don't blame him :P
<Ryunosuke> at the dropsuit collector
<Ryunosuke> selector
<Reikim> I wasn't, I was engaging in friendly teasing :P also he's legitimately busy so I hold him no ill will.
<Pikachu> Why does this remind me of Bf3? :l
<DashWithRainbows> Because reasons.
<MadSurge> Hey Allegr0 :3 whassup buddy?
<Allegr0> nm MadSurge :P
<MadSurge> Pikachu: this looks much more fun than bf3
<Amu-chan> I believe that you can't make ChanServ kick someone from a channel unless you are an AOP for the channel with a level 5 access level. At least that's by default. I don't think being an oper changes that requirement.
<Pikachu> MadSurge: I think bf3 graphics are 20% cooler
<AdamTheDuck> Pikachu, gtfo.
<AdamTheDuck> :P
<Bronyberg> Whats up friends?
<Franek12354> I think this is more escalated war rather than a battle
<Pikachu> brb
<MadSurge> I care little about graphics. If the game is shit then no amount of graphic will save it
<MadSurge> Just my opinion
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Amu-chan> Could depend on the server software too.
<AdamTheDuck> BF3 was so hyped on killing CoD and its graphics that it ended up becomeing CoD int he ned.
<AdamTheDuck> end*
<Franek12354> MadSurge: I would say something similar for sound as well
<AdamTheDuck> Damn you Close Quarters DLC...
<Bronyberg> your opinion is very valid my friend
<Bronyberg> and i second that statement
<thelonepony> damn you ea for yr expensive dlc
<thelonepony> your*
<twilight_sprinkle> gameplay>graphics for me, but i disagree with not giving games credit for good graphics, it takes a lot of effort to do that too
<AdamTheDuck> So yeah, I just ended up boycotting EA in the end after killing BF...
<Dken2021> battlefield?
<MadSurge> I basically care about the gameplay. If graphics are good too then even better
<Bronyberg> yeah but pretty graphics on a shit game is still sperinkles on a turd
<Amu-chan> It's been ages since I've been on a network I've been an oper on, so I can't say I'm 100% certain.
<MadSurge> ^
<Bronyberg> sorry for bad typing im kinda drunk tonight :P
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: how did they kill that too?
<twilight_sprinkle> depends, if it can be played for exploration, and its a cheap game, then it can be ok
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, killed it for me I should say.
<DerpyMuffins> Is Wrek trying to shoot a plane with a tank?
<Bronyberg> well i don't expect anything good from EA theese days
<AdamTheDuck> With Premium MadSurge.
<RedDragonX> finally got the damn server up, yay me
<MadSurge> Premium? It sounds shit already -__-
<Stormy> I used to know all this stuff
<Franek12354> Im a Premium Noob as well :)
<Stormy> then I disappeared from IRC for a few years
<Tassadork> you guys should just change teams
<CCCP> i didnt die
<Meanwhile> Terribly bored, bright ideas anyone?
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: niiiice
<Amu-chan> Yeah, that can happen when you haven't worked with something for a few years.
<AdamTheDuck> Meanwhile, lick people :3
<RedDragonX> Stormy you should play minecraft lol
<thelonepony> wb CCCP
<Stormy> okay maybe not years, but stil; :P

*ASoftFluffyThing flumps on the ground and sleeps
<Kandarihu> I decided to call it a ban since I had an argument with him earlier when he was streaming stuff that WAS morally offensive. And I felt that if I can't speak out against it, then I have no place on Bronystate. So I started throwing around the P ban, and he said he was happy to oblige since I was getting on his nerves.
<Meanwhile> The problem is you keep standing in front of bullets.
<Jmo> God I hate holidays. Got all the twits running around.
<DoctoDoctorWho> ASoftFluffyThing: Sleep is for the WEAK!
<DashWithRainbows> Joomay pls
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows I know the feel. Due to not being used to it and all and living in such a small apartment with 3 family members it zaps my desire to talk on my mic

<CrimsonPhoenix> SeaponiesofLiverpool, bonus point if you can figure out WHY I picked that movie

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I would've loved to have my B pick up there 2
<cachi01|phone> Twilight :3
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> because ur trottish?
<ScootaChicken> CrimsonPhoenix: Is it because The King's Speech is an excellent film?
<cachi01|phone> I would pick twilight as a B movie
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> ^
<ScootaChicken> That would be a logical explanation.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> what scoota said
<cachi01|phone> Then chat explodes

<Meanwhile> My old English teacher used to be loony for him.
<Lyra`> my lungs hurt
<Jmo> Why don't you get a spray bottle while you're at it.
<DashWithRainbows> I could.
<Lyra`> i probably have a pinched muscle.
*cuddly_kittehs takes large trout from Jmo's possesion and replaces with a smaller samon

<DashWithRainbows> But that requires effort.
<Lyra`> in my ribcage, its HURTS!
<cuddly_kittehs> Problem solved.

<Ninjazz> Respect the delicious species of fish.
<Jmo> This is why we can't have nice things.
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: Yep. Biolizard.
<fluttercry> 05,15I know I'm not seeing RP in here
<Dj_Cyber-4G> lol
<Ninjazz> Just fish, fluttercry.
<Ninjazz> It's all fish.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14man, I hated that boss
<Reikim> prince-dari, y so kick?
<cuddly_kittehs> Dash is armed with weapons of mass.....sparkles?
<Jmo> I blame Ninjazz.
<cuddly_kittehs> T_T
<Reikim> I wasn't even near the spam limit?
<Derpy_Hooves> SaxyPretender: I LOVED fighting him
<Reikim> ...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wowo fluttercry you went blind then
<Sabershy> Sushi? I just had some last night.
<Ninjazz> I blame Saxy's laundry.
<Lyra`> they lowered it
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the end bit was annoying-
<Lyra`> spelling.
*JRP wants to know why my battery is flat
<Reikim> Man, the Biolizard was an awesome boss.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14hey, you leave my laundry out of this
<Reikim> Once you figured him out, anyway.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<cuddly_kittehs> Sabershy: HOW COULD YOU CALL YOURSELF A SHY? :< meat-eater
<Derpy_Hooves> SaxyPretender: biolizard, imo was the only boss that put up a decent fight in that game
<Reikim> Spelling?
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: We spent almost 24 hours fighting him one time. Turns out all we had to was move towards him. :|
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the floaty bit was hell though
<Reikim> No it wasn't.
<AJIsAwesome> It was for me.
<Meanwhile> What other subjects are poor taste for jokes?
<Reikim> You just weren't thinking about it right.
*Sabershy pets cuddly_kittehs
<Derpy_Hooves> basic evading

<Derpy_Hooves> edvading 101
<Sabershy> Easy, I am not Fluttershy. :) Just a fan.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14It's the one boss I goddamn celebrated beating
<AJIsAwesome> ^
*cuddly_kittehs ackwardly purrs

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> more touhou http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RzOFyYIHto
<Lyra`> so
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I can STILL perfectly remember key things about that
<cuddly_kittehs> SaxyPretender: anyothers?
<Meanwhile> Ooh wait nevermind I've got one.
<Derpy_Hooves> but in all honestly
<Reikim> I've beaten the bastard something like seven times, it's not that hard.
<fluttercry> 05,15Beating Izanami in Persona 4 was worth a celebration for me
<JRP> We don't need no education
<Reikim> Lolicon./
<Ninjazz> Heavy Rain is STILL the only game I freaked out during playing.
<Lyra`> Martin Luther King Jr didnt get famous by sitting on his ass and keeping his mouth shut.
<Reikim> You can't get much lower than that.
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: As kids, we didn't even think of moving towards him. We thought he wouls tire out and then you had to grind on the tube to hit him.
<Lyra`> but rosa parks did.
<Meanwhile> Christianity. One womans lie about an affair that got blown waaay out of proportion...
<Sabershy> What I hated was the final boss battle where you just flew and hoped you hit the Biolizard's large... warts.
<Ninjazz> Especailly the doctor bit.
<Jmo> tsk tsk Ninjazz
<Reikim> Fools.
<cuddly_kittehs> prince-dari: Lunar Defense Force? Oh celestia.... there will be war on Luna's turf, there will!
<Reikim> Good to know I was justified in thinking I was smarter than all the other kids :P
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Still, I'm close to fighting him again
<Rain> more pings because of a game
<Meanwhile> You made that joke already.
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Your compliment is duly noted. :P
<Lyra`> did i?
<Meanwhile> Mm, in mane.
<Ninjazz> Sorry, Rain. Didn't see you there. :p
<SaxyPretender> 0,14just gotta wrap up Hero and Dark stories
<Meanwhile> No one laughed then either.
<Lyra`> did it get a good r
<Lyra`> fuck your couch
<AJIsAwesome> HATED Crazy Gadget.
<Derpy_Hooves> SaxyPretender i see you playing it on my friends list :3
<Ninjazz> Jmo, y u no love heavy Rayn? ;__;
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep, got through most of the stories in about 5 hours
<Lyra`> it made me laugh.
<fluttercry> 05,15Heavy Rain is the best movie on Playstation 3
<Jmo> never got the chance to play it.
<Reikim> Stupidest boss, though, was Shadow/Sonic in White Forest.
<Reikim> Just homing attack at him repeatedly and win.
<Reikim> It was literally a matter of mashing the A button.
<fluttercry> 05,15Also JAAAAASON
<Dj_Cyber-4G> wow still no stream
<Ninjazz> SHAAAAAAAAUUUUUN.
<d3rb> jason? jayyysooooonn!!!!
<cuddly_kittehs> Anyway, gtg! Also; Jmo and Ninjazz, settle this over a bottle of Grama apple's moonshine 'cider'
<AJIsAwesome> "Hm, I'm the coolest!" Really, Shadow? :S
<Meanwhile> Please, if you're going to talk about Heavy Rain you need to mention NAHMAN JAYDEN EFF BEE EYE
<Jmo> Toodles cuddly_kittehs
<Ninjazz> Jmo, if you ever get the chance, it's an awesome experience.
*Reikim looks left
<fluttercry> 05,15Nahman Jayden was awesome
<Jmo> So I've heard a thousand times.
*Reikim looks right
*Reikim looks up
*Reikim looks down
<Ninjazz> I don't drink cuddles.
<Derpy_Hooves> SaxyPretender on the gamecube version, i successfully raised 3 chaos chioas

<Meanwhile> Christianity.
<Derpy_Hooves> AJIsAwesome: they are OP as fuck
<fluttercry> 05,15Turns out if you wear his sweet glasses too long his eyes bleed
<JRP> My one was fast as hell
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh wow
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that's pretty sweet, Derpy_Hooves
<Ninjazz> Meh. Religion jokes arn't as funny as terrorist jokes.
<owloysius> beats me, i don't know how much 20 pieces of silver is worth
<Meanwhile> I don't understand Christians, they say that gambling is wrong, then bet their entire life on there being a heaven.
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: I know, but you can't change their stats.
<AJIsAwesome> And now we're on religion jokes. Let's see how long this will last.
<fluttercry> 05,15Let's not
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Lyra`> or we can :3
<Sabershy> ^
<Derpy_Hooves> SaxyPretender: the downfall is, if you max out a chaos choas stats, it is impossible for them to win a flying race
<Lyra`> scientology jokes anypony?
<Lyra`> or is that too easy?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah
<Sabershy> Dam it Lyra
<Meanwhile> Fair enough, let's face it the religious can't take it.
<owloysius> "Scientology"
<SaxyPretender> 0,14never really bothered too much with the chao stuff
<Derpy_Hooves> cause they will LITERALLY fly past the finish line, and not turn around
<Lyra`> no, owloysius, it doesnt get a capitalization.
<Meanwhile> Besides, Religion is the greatest joke ever told~
<Ninjazz> Takes a REALLY good one to make me laugh.
<fluttercry> 05,15That's enough
<AJIsAwesome> I played the Chao Garden segments more than other parts of the game itself. :$
<owloysius> Lyra`: It's the first word, fraulein.
<twilight_sprinkle> it shouldve been enough when people were offended by the ilness jokes.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> i mean seriously chat, i am dissappoint
<Meanwhile> I'm really struggling to think of ideas here, I've already been through dead babies, 9/11, columbine, cancer...
<Dj_Cyber-4G> dead chat?
<Dj_Cyber-4G> dead chat...
*Dj_Cyber-4G sighs
<thelonepony> nope, enjoyin the video

<Meanwhile> Religion got cut short.
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: How about something non-macabre?
<Spectrum_Rush> yes this is definitely something to hit caps over
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile, computer jokes would be nice >.>
<Reikim> Overdrive is one of my favourite Touhous for a lot of reasons.
<Reikim> Primary among them is my ability to sympathize.
<Ninjazz> Canterlock is the prefered mode of worthless expression.
<owloysius> bye
<Meanwhile> Wrek and his chat lag.
<Kandarihu> Wow. Triple kick
<Jmo> Hot damn.
<Spectrum_Rush> dat lag
<fluttercry> 05,15netsplit?
<Ninjazz> What's that one guy say at this part?

<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: cause netsplit
<Ninjazz> Lag.
<Meanwhile> because fighting games are all the same anyway.
<Reikim> I got a ton of messages out of nowhere.

<AJIsAwesome> Computers can't walk
<Meanwhile> The wheelchair.
<Jmo> Ninjazz pls
<Ryunosuke> I dont think it was a split though, maybe a backup in the tubes? someone on 4chan dropped a load in the toilet perhaps? :)
<JRP> Because I threw it there

<Jmo> Ah Adam Sandler, how thou use to be funny.
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: pls
<Ryunosuke> just saying, if it was a split, there'd be a ton of quits. That seemed more like... internet lag
<Ryunosuke> well
<xmasmare> no stream?
<AJIsAwesome> Nope. :)
<owloysius> nope
<Ninjazz> Still trying to figure out if this is my craptactular machine being crap, my crappy internet being crap or just ponychat's fine services being kinda slow.
<Meanwhile> Well, I'm pretty much tapped for joke material now.
*Jmo slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
*Dj_Cyber-4G looks at time= 3:12 "NOT EARLY ENOUGH!"
<Jmo> Figure it out faster.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile, computer jokes. Now. Or Minecraft jokes
<Meanwhile> Oh no wait.
<Spectrum_Rush> huzzah
<Ryunosuke> Ninjazz, do a tracert
<Ninjazz> You broke it jaymoo. :C
<Jmo> Woopwoop
<Ninjazz> fixitfixitfixit.
<Ninjazz> Ryunosuke, a what now?
<Meanwhile> Doctor: "Bad news, you have cancer and alzheimer's." Patient: "Oh well, could be worse. I could have cancer"
<Ryunosuke> a tracert
<JRP> School tomorow
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Already said that.
<Ninjazz> Time for google.
<DoctoDoctorWho> So, howsabout some nazi jokes?
<Reikim> Four.
<Meanwhile> Did I? I forgot~
<ASoftFluffyThing> Still no stream?
<Ninjazz> AJIsAwesome doesn't get the joke. Hahaha.
<Ryunosuke> basically, what it does, is traces the route, your internet signal takes from your OS to its destination
<AJIsAwesome> Ninjazz: I did.
<cachi01|phone> Meanwhile u already said that!!
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: http://i.imgur.com/3pcyz.gif
<Ninjazz> It's within the finer lines.
<owloysius> Doctor: "Bad news, you have aids and alzheimer's." Patient: "Oh well, could be worse. I could have cancer"
<Meanwhile> Nah sorry Nazi jokes are out of Mein Kampfort zone.
<Dj_Cyber-4G> MEANWHILE I JUST TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THAT STOP!
<AJIsAwesome> Hidden joke within joke is still wasn't funny.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14All right, that's enough of the stupid jokes.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<cachi01|phone> Spectrum_Rush how to fix BSoD
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oh, no stream. I'll just plant this here
<Ninjazz> Ryunosuke, oh so like a speed test?
<ASoftFluffyThing> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NylmdC_uEM
<owloysius> Anne Frankly these have to stop
<Ryunosuke> kinda of
<Meanwhile> Why'd Hitler kill himself? He saw his gas bill.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Meanwhile: Whatever! these jokes are Hitlarious!
<Ryunosuke> not quite
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, yes. Exactly like that. Lol.
<JRP> I can fix it *ten seconds later* computer go boom
<ValtheJean> 2,14 please read the rules, when a mod asks you to stop: stop.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Dj_Cyber-4G> OK MEANWHILE THOSE ARE FUNNY but the others... not cool
<Meanwhile> Oh please I've got one more and it's a good'un.
<d3rb> Dj_Cyber-4G so hollocaust jokes ok, cancer jokes not?
<Spectrum_Rush> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwZSzlk4JHA
<DoctoDoctorWho> ValtheJean: y no jokes?
<Ryunosuke> a speed test does upload and download speed testes, a tracert just pings EVERY server and hop from its origin to its destination and you can keep track of ping times rather than upload and download speeds
<AJIsAwesome> DoctoDoctorWho: Because some people take offense to them? :S
<Meanwhile> C'mon just one more, it's not that bad. Promise.
<Dj_Cyber-4G> no its makeing fun of hitler not the holocaust
<ValtheJean> 2,14 JOKES, are fine. Just keep it sensitive towards chatters
<JRP> Bloody bandwidth cap
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Nope.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I.E: stop being borderline offensive
<Jmo> LOl
<Dj_Cyber-4G> THANK YOU!
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome: Thats only if they allow themselves to get offended
<PeachStreak> http://i3.ytimg.com/sh/JOOdP2aaviQ/showposter.jpg?v=504a2fe5
<Ninjazz> Ryunosuke, huh. Alright. I'll run to Google now.
<Meanwhile> That's a wonky line though. Whether or not you're offended by something is a choice.
<Ryunosuke> I am of the philosophy that everyone needs bacon, more bacon
<twilight_sprinkle> DoctoDoctorWho: its not always about being offended. sometimes ilness jokes just reminds you of a memory you dont want to think about it
<owloysius> we need more vespene gas
<JRP> Ninja gaiden act 4 - 2
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you can say that to yourself if it helps you sleep at night. It's not welcome here
*Dj_Cyber-4G takes bacon
<Ryunosuke> those who dont eat bacon, are usually the ones that are uptight with the world and everyone else :)
<Jmo> MOAR PYLONS.
<PeachStreak> i found a cute picture of twilight http://i3.ytimg.com/sh/JOOdP2aaviQ/showposter.jpg?v=504a2fe5
<twilight_sprinkle> DoctoDoctorWho: i wasnt offended, im not easily offended, but i can understand how people would not like it
<Meanwhile> How I sleep is irrelevant, it is. You can either choose to see the humour for what it is or you can get your knickers in a twist.
<Spectrum_Rush> PeachStreak: just so ya know you're breking a rule there
<AJIsAwesome> PeachStreak: Those kind of pictures aren't allowed, you know that right?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Yeah I DEFINITELY need a job :3
<PeachStreak> oh first kick
<PeachStreak> lol
<JRP> Bye all my iPhone is going to die
<Shizuka> 13Meanwhile: This is your final warning. Behave, be respectful, follow our rules, or get out.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<lowfn> Why hasn't there been streamfor awhile?
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: or you could grow up finally
<DoctoDoctorWho> Well anyway, Im fine with a good joke, but these nazi refrences just arent Reich...
<Derpy_Hooves> PeachStreak: i fucking love that, nightmare fuel only feeds me
<im_texting_my_dog> I saw Frankenweenie today lol
<Meanwhile> I think you'll find that is how it works in the real world, and that I did stop.
<Derpy_Hooves> PeachStreak: nice try though
<PeachStreak> Derpy_Hooves: first time getting kicked Brohoof /)
<Ninjazz> Jeesus someone's been ahving a bad weekend.
<Derpy_Hooves> no brohoof
<Dj_Cyber-4G> I wish I had dreams
<im_texting_my_dog> I never dream
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: implying you know anything about how the real world works
<PeachStreak> first time being kicked
<Jmo> You smell Ninjazz.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Actually, debating with mods is childish. Whether or not you like the rule is irrelevant. If you press it further, I'll be happy to offer you the ban you've been yearning for
<Ninjazz> Now mine just got relatively worse.
<Ninjazz> :<
<Dj_Cyber-4G> I always have the same nightmare every night
<Jmo> :3
<Dj_Cyber-4G> and i remember it
<Meanwhile> Honestly, playing with you is no fun at all.
<lowfn> Why hasn't there been streamfor awhile?
<Dj_Cyber-4G> like it actualy happened
<Derpy_Hooves> PeachStreak: actually, you may have been kicked, but that just gave you a very bad first impression :P
<Reikim> ...Do tell, DJ.
<AJIsAwesome> Dj_Cyber-4G: Have you considered getting help?
<d3rb> then why are you here Meanwhile ?
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<thelonepony> ^^^
<twilight_sprinkle> well actually its obvous why
<Dj_Cyber-4G> yeah but its been all my life and nothing ever helps
<lowfn> Dj_Cyber-4G: What is this dream about?
<twilight_sprinkle> he has no life
<PeachStreak> Derpy_Hooves: i have been here for a while though so.... ya
<Meanwhile> Well, I'm here for the movies and for amusing shenanigans in chat.
<Jmo> Lul the no life card.
<Dj_Cyber-4G> ... well its kind of... weird
<Lyra`> i dont know if i love halloween.
<twilight_sprinkle> its legit this time, though
<AJIsAwesome> Lyra`: How so?
<Ninjazz> I liked the part where we got along.
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont normally say that, but its true.
<Lyra`> or just candy and scantily clad women in the cold <3
<DashWithRainbows> Joomay It's the best card out there, yo.
<Jmo> ikr
<AJIsAwesome> DashWithRainbows: Better than Blue Eyes Shining Dragon?
<lowfn> Dj_Cyber-4G: Ive seen more weird than you could weird out on the weirding weird
<Lyra`> what are you lot going as for halloween?
<DashWithRainbows> Although it ties with the "Your face" and the "Your mom" cards.
<Jmo> God damn it AJ, you couldn't resist could you.
<flutterchu> Meanwhile: *sigh*
<DashWithRainbows> AJIsAwesome Yep.
<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: Nope. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: lies, nothing is as good as the blue eyes white dragon foil!
<DashWithRainbows> flutterchu You do realize you can set it so you ignore him, right?
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyvz3b3C3M1r3k1m8o1_500.png
<Meanwhile> And as it stands Val I've not been yearning for anything, I just have a habit of speaking my mind.
<flutterchu> DashWithRainbows: no i dont know how to do that
<ValtheJean> 2,14 your actions lead towards the contrary
<AJIsAwesome> flutterchu: /ignore insert name here
<DashWithRainbows> right click his name
<ValtheJean> 2,14 considering we've been more than leniant with you breaking rules
<Meanwhile> Hence the "Speaking my mind" part.
<ASoftFluffyThing> That YuGiOh movie ruined any chances of me attempting to learn the game a second time
<cachi01|phone> Is there any stream?
<DashWithRainbows> and choose ignore.

<Jmo> Ouch.
<AJIsAwesome> SO optimistic.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 twilight_sprinkle that's enough
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: i mean seriously, youre 19, go do something useful instead of insulting everyone in an irc chat
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you are to respect all other users *at*all*times*
<Derpy_Hooves> :V
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: im honestly trying to stimulate him

<AJIsAwesome> ^
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome: all this hate sucks, Its taking me way out of Mein Kampfort zone.
<Rain> twilight_sprinkle, he said stop.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 twilight_sprinkle: then that counts as trolling, I'd advise against that
<twilight_sprinkle> i know, im not arguing, just explaining
<Meanwhile> No by all means, carry on. Have a go, I can take it.

<Ninjazz> Meanwhile, hey, man. Are you okay?
<Derpy_Hooves> DoctoDoctorWho: http://derpy.me/QMB9d here ya go

<rdash> ScootaChicken: so the shit hit the fan? XD
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile, I wish. But srsly, you've been getting a bit more how you say... caustic lately.
<Meanwhile> But no frankly I'm not. The bottom line is if I think you're a twat I will tell you so, and I don't care what colour you speak in.
<rdash> Inb4 banned...

<Yahooz> dude, everyone is here. Shit. hit. the fan.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 people only get banned for breaking rules
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: i didnt mean it to be disrespectful though, im not interested in pointless insults. im not arguing or anything, just explaining
<ValtheJean> 2,14 making an idiot of yourself, sadly, is not against them
<cachi01|phone> Oooooh
<Meanwhile> Probably. But I'd rather be banned speaking my mind than hang around as someone scared into line.
<Phase4> Lyra`, who's rosa parks?
<Derpy_Hooves> DoctoDoctorWho: back in your kampfy zone? :3
<Reikim> "[00:21:56] <twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: thats one empty mind you got there"
<DoctoDoctorWho> Seriously people, If you have something to say then just come Auschwitz it!
<Reikim> Not interested in pointless insults.
<Reikim> Sure.
<rdash> ValtheJean: no, but pointlessly arguing with mods, being an asshole, and trolling are... -_-
<d3rb> so guys...how about them ponies amiright?!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim starting with twilight_sprinkle again ?
<Reikim> Nope.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Butt. Hurt.
<Reikim> Just pointing out things. You know. Explaining.
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: i meant that the whole "im speaking my mind" thing is an excuse. if insulting really is all thats on bis mind, then its empty
<Reikim> Clearly.
<owloysius> i'm on the new seapony diet. I see ponies, i eat them.
<Ninjazz> Hey Yahooz. Did drama just jump chats?
<Kimori> your back?
<ASoftFluffyThing> SO, WHAT'S THIS MINECRAFT MOD ABOUTT?
<ScootaChicken> Yo guys, errone just chill ouuuuut.
<Jmo> Come on Dovah man, you know better :P
<rdash> Ninjazz: yes >_>
<Yahooz> Ninjazz: apperently
<ASoftFluffyThing> You know, the one that you can build nuclear stuff with.
<Kimori> I was thinking you were going to bed
<rdash> Ninjazz: this is #bronystate... Welcome xD
<Dovah> Ok really, they are just jokes ment to make something bad seem funny and not so bad...
<ASoftFluffyThing> And solar panels
<Yahooz> so much that rdash is actually on bronystate
<DashWithRainbows> ScootaChicken Honestly, just stay outta this one.
<PeachStreak> kickcount: PeachStreak
<Yahooz> I mean, hot damn
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, faith in a higher power isn't gambling
<Kimori> Are you around Adjeca
<Meanwhile> You're a bit late on that one Kandarihu.
<rdash> Yahooz: well, I've been here for a while now, just don't talk much...
<Ninjazz> Ikr.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> strong independent woman who dont need no man ?
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Better late than never.
<Dovah> If you don't like it, there is an ignore function.
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, I know now. I was scrolled up when I saw it
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: because hes nt expressing any opinions, hes not having discussions, hes just making jokes that are offensive to others, and hes ignoring their feelings. thats what i meant
<Meanwhile> AJIsAwesome: Unless you're an electric chair repairman.
<Spectrum_Rush> is... is it lika a ful moon or something, everyones all antsy tonight
<ValtheJean> 2,14 kandarihu: just don't start with this
<Yahooz> rdash: duuuude, you should hang out here more. its not always like this
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Cades> no haha I'm not
<lowfn> Spectrum_Rush: I'm not antsy :3
<Dovah> ^^
<Ninjazz> But, anyways, Meanwhile, whatever's been pressing on your hostile button, I hope it jumps off soon. i really mean that. In the most polite and friendly way possible.
<Yahooz> dont prevoke the prevokable
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Rosa Parks was an important figure in the Civil RIghts movement
<Yahooz> someones anus might get anihilated
<twilight_sprinkle> *provoke
<Phase4> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks
<rdash> Yahooz: I hope not...this is actually turning me away from this channel more and more every second tbh...
<Yahooz> point proven
<Meanwhile> Val: So, you've been lenient with me breaking rules. How so, that I might better avoid doing so in the future.
<Reikim> Oh HER
<Reikim> The one who refused to move.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep
<rdash> Yahooz: it's pure insanity ATM, mixed with racist jokes and trolling...
<Reikim> Badass lady. All of my respect.
<Phase4> that seems to be all she did
<twilight_sprinkle> Yahooz: i was joking. but offensive jokes arent right, it doesnt matter if others can be strong enough to take it
<Ninjazz> rdash, it's fun here. Really is. Just it's hit a bad snag atm.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 For one: when a mod warns you for something, or you are kicked for behavior: suck it up rather than bitch about it
<Dovah> http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/363/539/340.png I find that word hilarious..
<Derpy_Hooves> rdash: you hardly ever talk
<Spectrum_Rush> I saw no racist jokes...
<Yahooz> twilight_sprinkle: never said you were...
<d3rb> i remember when it was friendly in here....
<Meanwhile> Even if said mod is a crybaby?
<rdash> Derpy_Hooves: not in here, but in my 49 other channels, I do lol
<Jmo> This place is a place of madness. :>
<Yahooz> I think a +m is in order
<Yahooz> PREACH THE GOOD WORD VAL
<Derpy_Hooves> actually nvm, i don't want you to talk
<Ninjazz> Sigh.
<Phase4> learn something new every day
<rdash> Dafuq
<Dovah> ValtheJean: DoctoDoctorWho, would like me to tell you thats what he thinks of the jokes
<twilight_sprinkle> funny
<Meanwhile> Fine I'll work on it but give me some time.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 if you have an issue for how mods behave, you can email bronystate@gmail.com. Otherwise, shut the fuck up because the only crybaby is the person bitching about being kicked
<twilight_sprinkle> who wouldve thought that lack of stream would cause such madness
<rdash> The hell did I do now Derpy_Hooves...?
<Meanwhile> That's always otakon.
<Derpy_Hooves> rdash: i don't want to talk either :V
<Ninjazz> Oh lel.
<DashWithRainbows> twilight_sprinkle Actually, this was bound to happen sooner or later.
<Spectrum_Rush> :kickcount otakon
<twilight_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: true, very true
<Spectrum_Rush> huh
<Ninjazz> They turned off the commands I think.
<rdash> Derpy_Hooves: oh, you made it sound as if I did something wrong :S
<Dovah> http://scranton.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw4719--_butthurt.jpg
<Meanwhile> To be fair though otakon does trip off the kickbot at least twice a day.
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: awww
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> http://mlkshk.com/r/2HUV
<rdash> Dovah: noice xD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 believe me, we have a special book for Otakon :P
<Ninjazz> He loves the enter button.
<Meanwhile> I do believe you.
<Ninjazz> otakon holds a special place for all of our hearts.
<Spectrum_Rush> more like he rapes the enter button >.>
<d3rb> Ninjazz, so true
<Reikim> A nice, fat volume in the kicklogs, roughly equal to 1% of the total library.
*Dovah senses extreme butthurt
<d3rb> he is the most shipable
<ASoftFluffyThing> I kinda feel sorry for otakon, he gets kicked all the time
<flutterchu> hey Meanwhile
<Spectrum_Rush> ok I deserved that
<flutterchu> Meanwhile:
<Ninjazz> He's used to it.
<owloysius> x kick
<twilight_sprinkle> is it because he types fast or laggy internet?
<Ninjazz> Oh come on.
<flutterchu> Meanwhile:
<Ninjazz> DO WE HAVE TO RESTART DRAMA.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Though when he got kicked like every 2 minutes on his birthday
<Ninjazz> STOP IT.
<flutterchu> the ignore button i FUN
<Spectrum_Rush> flutterchu: knock it off
<flutterchu> *is
<ASoftFluffyThing> That was fun.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> flutterchu what do you expect to happen by repeating Meanwhile ?
<Meanwhile> Really though, I could email the site and say I think some of the mod team are pretentious, jump-the-gun, thin skinned, overly serious twonks but I doubt it'd accomplish any more or less than just saying it.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 flutterchu: stop spamming meanwhile's name
<Reikim> And thus, the cycle of butthurt is renewed.
<flutterchu> i only did it like 3 times and he's been quiet latly
<ASoftFluffyThing> Here we go again
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Meanwhile: we take all criticism well, so long as it's actual constructive criticism and not butthurt McGee
<ASoftFluffyThing> SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MINECRAFT!
<Dovah> http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/318/507/080.jpg
<Red_M> i dont even... wha... i...
<Meanwhile> Val: Fair enough, why's rape a banned word?
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile, as a mod for another channel, criticism is one thing that comes far too less than we'd appreciate.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's not...?
<twilight_sprinkle> it is though
<flutterchu> Meanwhile: are you nice now ouo
<Yahooz> Shizuka kicks for rape jokes. Thats reasonable ish though
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<Yahooz> the word shouldnt be used in vain :p
<Ninjazz> Seems like individual mod's discretion.
<Red_M> why does that word even need to be used in here?
<Dovah> http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/316/781/33e.jpg
<Meanwhile> The worst those jokes ever come to is a particular scene in a stream
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> flutterchu don't you have better things to do than seeing if Meanwhile responds to you ?
<Meanwhile> Like that chair bit in Ghostbusters earlier.
<Meanwhile> And someone says "Rape"
<Meanwhile> That's it.
<flutterchu> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: okay ;_;
<Red_M> Dovah: dont you have something better to do than just post iamges?
<Rain> reasonable-ish enough? rape jokes are /never/ appropriot
<twilight_sprinkle> they arent. however
<Dovah> Red_M: No, so shove off.
<Shizuka> 13Rape jokes are not funny. Ever.
<Jmo> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> there are many other jokes that arent appropriate, but they are allowed
<Rex_Mundi> is this rediculousness still gOing on?!
<Meanwhile> Now I don't know if she gets night terrors about big sweaty hands and alchohol breath, but it just seems a little too high strung.
<d3rb> wow
<Ninjazz> ...
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Mundi: imo we should get this out of the way once and for all
<Rain> Meanwhile.
<Reikim> Rape jokes aren't just in bad taste, they also demonstrate crude thinking. It wouldn't really hurt to think up something more intelligent to say than yelling "RAPE" every time something even vaguely sexual pops up on stream.
<Ninjazz> God...damn...
<Derpy_Hooves> dat ban....
<Dken2021> seriously? are we still on the issue with the rape jokes? geez people
<Ninjazz> Never thought I'd see the day.
<cachi01|phone> Meanwhile banned?
<Rex_Mundi> Meanwhile, at the legion of doom headquarters
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well this chat will be evn more ded now
<Yahooz> Oh lawdy
<cachi01|phone> Well i didnt see that comming :I
<ASoftFluffyThing> It finaly happened...
<Reikim> ...Wekk.
<Reikim> *Well
<ASoftFluffyThing> And I've been here since last November
<twilight_sprinkle> well whaddya know, +b meanwhile actually is a legit command
<Ninjazz> Jesusfuckingdrama.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and not a single fuck was given that day
<Ninjazz> I had it up to HERE with freakin' drama.
<cachi01|phone> Lol
<Derpy_Hooves> well, shizuka, banned his vhost, i don't think it covers his actual ip.
<Dovah> ValtheJean: Not. A single. FUCK.
<ScootaChicken> I bet tomorrow Hipster_Brony will come back and ban Dermathil.
<Yahooz> ValtheJean: to be fair, if a fuck was not given, you wouldnt respond to him as much as just kick/ban him
<Ninjazz> I think he konws better.
<Rex_Mundi> can you get back from a ban, or is this a perm-ban site?
<Ninjazz> You know... it's going to get alot lesser Grammer Nazy in here.
<Yahooz> ScootaChicken: Hot damn pass me the popcorn
<Red_M> guys i dont think we need to talk about a topic that just got someone banned and continue to talk about that person and the subject so can we move on?
<d3rb> Ninjazz, nazi**
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Derpy_Hooves i don't think it does still he has to deactivate the vhost first also i don't think he is foolish enoug to get permabanned
<AJIsAwesome|AFK> Rex_Mundi: You can appeal to not stay permabanned.
<Dovah> FYI: people, DoctoDoctorWho is 1ft away so, sometimes its him and othertimes it be me.
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Mundi: they can be times or not. you can also get back by changing ip, but thats ban avoiding which is punishable by permaban
<ScootaChicken> Ninjazz: *a lot, *Grammar, *Nazi
<ValtheJean> 2,14 meh, believe it or not, we aren't monsters. We don't actually LIKE having to ban people
<Ninjazz> O u guiz. <3
<Dovah> Ninjazz: *nazi, sorry.
<Derpy_Hooves> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: the vhost only shows up when you identify yourself
<Reikim> We noticed. You barely ever do.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> uhmm True
<twilight_sprinkle> still though. i want to say that there are other jokes that should be monitored as strictly as rape jokes
<Shamroc> uhm...whereed meanwhile go?
<DashWithRainbows> Things will simmer down now.
<DashWithRainbows> He got banned.
<Yahooz> ValtheJean: especially people youve known for a while
<Shamroc> ah..
<Yahooz> thats for sure
<DashWithRainbows> Shitstorm finally arrived.
<Shamroc> ...there goes that
<Dovah> ValtheJean: Fight. Club.
<Shamroc> been here since may
<Shamroc> never been banned thing
<Reikim> I can count on one hand the number of times I've seen the banhammer dropped.
<Ninjazz> Imo, Val, you guys are very linient, sometimes to the point of being TOO linient. I appreciate it really.
<Ninjazz> Lol.
<Yahooz> lolz
<Shamroc> this is why i make nice with mods
<Jmo> Osnap
<Red_M> "Oh! its you... how have you been? Ive been fine.... AFTER YOU MURDERED ME! you monster...."
<Shamroc> so they DONT murder me while i sleep
<ScootaChicken> Ninjazz: *lenient
<Jmo> Wanna do that again Dovah?
<Yahooz> i though Sumicas bot would be on that
<ASoftFluffyThing> ValtheJean, aww we still can't say Quarrel Establishment?
<Yahooz> while he doesnt like banning
<Shizuka> 13Ninjazz: i tend to be too self-restrained, there were about a dozen times this past week alone i considered dropping the hammer on meanwhile
<ValtheJean> 2,14 nah, the bot got removed after the movie night was over
<Dovah> ValtheJean: You dont like banning but you do oh so very much enjoy kicking for no reason.
<Yahooz> he loves joke kicks
<Ninjazz> ScootaChicken, you're even more nazie than meenwhile.
<Rain> nah, Yahooz. Val would probably still try to ban me in a heart beat for speaking ill about Caramel
<Kandarihu> Flight Cub
<ScootaChicken> Ninjazz: I can't even
<ScootaChicken> help[
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well what kind of fun would there be without joke kicks? :P
<ScootaChicken> fajl;
<cachi01|phone> First rule of the bean club. You dont talk about the bean club
<Reikim> Shizu, really, you should get into the habit of dropping your mod powers more often.
<d3rb> joke kicks are the best kicks
<Yahooz> Rain: oh heaven forbid >:3
<Dken2021> Fisticuffs meeting
<Dovah> ValtheJean: They offend me.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 honestly shizu: almost EVERY mod has considered it
<Ninjazz> Shizuka, believe me, I respect how much you've been restraining yourself on that.
<ScootaChicken> I get joke kicked more or less the moment I enter chat every day.
<Shizuka> 13Reikim: from experience at goon haven, if you aren't being called a nazi, you aren't doing your job right
<Yahooz> ValtheJean: i miss the days of mods wars tbh, when users were less troublesome than mods by far XD
<ScootaChicken> Usually by Scoot-Scootaloo, Dari or RinBarDosh.
<ASoftFluffyThing> ValtheJean, but you just kicked Ninjazz for saying F**** C*** lolol. Props though :)
<DashWithRainbows> Both understandable and respectable.
<Rex_Mundi> *hugs Shizuka*
<ValtheJean> 2,14 fine then Dovah, I'll only kick you when you deserve it
<Reikim> If you're being called a nazi, you're not doing it right either.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Rain ValtheJean can't take a joke on caramel without kicking/warning
<Ninjazz> Especially since you're been the target of some very caustic comments.
<BaconMane> 0,5nuthin to do here
<Shamroc> indeed so
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Yahooz: I do too
<Shamroc> not a suckup
<Shamroc> just a wuss
<Ninjazz> ASoftFluffyThing, I wasn't kicked by Val.
<Yahooz> People these days
<Red_M> 1. -- nice starting ip you have there
<Sabershy> I like BaconMane.
<ScootaChicken> Well y'know, some things in life are bad.
<Reikim> I'm not espousing an authoritarian, semi-dictator approach to modding. I'm saying that a good balance must be found.
<Dovah> ValtheJean: My point is, it's a joke they shouldnt offend people, if it does they can just ignore it.
<Shamroc> a horrible wuss whos afraid of people and hides behind mods like a coward
<ScootaChicken> They can really make you mad.
<Yahooz> you havent lived if you havent been kicked/banned
<cachi01|phone> Dat,kik
<Ninjazz> VAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL.
<ScootaChicken> Other things just make you swear or curse.
<BaconMane> 0,5I disagree, Val
<ScootaChicken> But when you're chewing on life's gristle, don't grumble, give a whistle!
<BaconMane> 0,5I have not.
<Rex_Mundi> When chewing on lifes grissle, dont rumble, give a whistle
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the difference, Dovah, is when actions are done with the intent of harassing and/or annoying
<Red_M> you havent been on IRC for long without being at aleast kicked or banned once
<d3rb> i remember when i think it was sumica tried to kick himself...it worked
<Reikim> Currently, the scale is leaning too far towards leniency. It wouldn't be a good idea to go all the way to nazi-hood, but it would be nice to see that scale sliding a bit back the other way.
<Sabershy> Yahooz: I have en ming here for 3moths and I am really happy I haven't been considered as someone to be kicked. :)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hence why I said *ALMOST*, LC
<Ninjazz> 3 months. en ming?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Sabershy: give me a moment >: D
<owloysius> what was my last ban for...
<Red_M> been on ponychat for less than a day... been on IRC for 4+ years
*Rain is planing on a girls night out.
<Sabershy> I love you too, ValtheJean. :)
<Yahooz> Sabershy: ive been here for over a year. I have been kicked up around 40-50 times and banned once
*Rain thinks she might invite Caramel along
<Dken2021> but he's a boy
<Dovah> ValtheJean: Then me and DoctoDoctorWho at the very least should be fine, we mean nothing but a good laugh.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i can be a Nazi mod if you want, i'll drop the hammer on everyone atleast once a week
<Mutterguy> Dken2021 or is he?
<ASoftFluffyThing> I remember the first time I got kicked but I deserved it so it was my fault
<Ninjazz> 6 months. Haven't been banend once. Kicked alot.
<Reikim> I've been kicked sooooo often. Mostly by SaxyPretender. He tends to get kind of antsy whenever I mention the fact that fighting games are CLEARLY an inferior genre of video game.
<ScootaChicken> Sabershy: I'm the same as Yahooz, but I've been kicked over 100 times and I can't remember how many times I've been banned.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Rain can i go ?
<ScootaChicken> Mostly by either LC, Dari or RinBarDosh.
<Shizuka> 13now that that's all over with, if i could direct everypony's attention to the refresh button under the stream
<Yahooz> because hes so NAUGHTY
<Red_M> ive never been kicked on ponychat... but have been on other IRC nets
<Shizuka> 13hopefully mips is working now
<Yahooz> TEEHEE
<DashWithRainbows> RinBarDosh is best pony.
<Reikim> ...
<Reikim> Awwwww
<NocturnalBlade|Skype> i just missed Meanwhile getting banned!?
<Rex_Mundi> :O
<Reikim> No reaction.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Rain: should I be afraid to ask to what?
<Ninjazz> Aight. Time to cool off.
<ASoftFluffyThing> NocturnalBlade|Skype, yes you did.
<twilight_sprinkle> NocturnalBlade|Skype: si
<Yahooz> DoshwithRambo pls
<Ninjazz> NocturnalBlade|Skype, yes. Moving along.

<otakon17> Hiya all what I miss?
<DashWithRainbows> Yahwhoz pls
<ValtheJean> 2,14 meh, seen it
<Dken2021> Rain le gasp!
<ScootaChicken> otakon17: Ohohoho.
<Reikim> Nazi mods are bad mods.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 technically the one on the right isn't Caramel, that's Toffee
<Ninjazz> Ah otakon17.
<Reikim> Pushover mods are bad mods.
<ASoftFluffyThing> First time I got banned was for 24 hours. Worst 24 hours ever. But enough about that
<AJIsAwesome|AFK> Hi, otakon17. :)
<Reikim> Absent mods are bad mods.
<thelonepony> hi otakon17
<twilight_sprinkle> oh that reminds me ValtheJean , i had a few suggestions for your trivia thing. should i tell you now or another time?
<Reikim> Selectively-blind mods are bad mods.
<Yahooz> The one on the right is not the Caramel that Val loves...
<DashWithRainbows> otakon17 I don't even want to bring it back up.
<otakon17> ScootaChicken: Yh I know about yonder prick ban
<Shamroc> ...good mods are bad mods
<Rain> Maybe Caramel changed her name to Toffee, Val.
<Kandarihu> I was kicked by Scoot-Scootaloo the other day. Needless to say, it got worse from there.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 tell you what, catch me when my head's better tomorow
<Shizuka> 13ponies seeing it?
<Reikim> What are you talking about?
<twilight_sprinkle> okie ValtheJean
<Rex_Mundi> I wonder if i ever got close to getting kicked...
<ASoftFluffyThing> Shizuka, I see it
<AJIsAwesome|AFK> Yep. :)
<otakon17> ValtheJean: Not feeling well man?
<Shamroc> bad mods being good mods
<Reikim> That's a logical paradox, and therefore invalid.
<Kandarihu> We're seeing it, and hearing it.
<Yahooz> maybe some nice 3.6 will help clear your head Val
<NocturnalBlade|Skype> i see it Shizuka
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I see you trying Rain, but you haven't said anything Dari hasn't already
<Shizuka> 13metallica and symphony
<otakon17> Shizuka: I see and hear it loud and clear
<Mutterguy> certainly hearing it
<dashierulez> love you guys!!!
<Yahooz> Dari has done it all
<twilight_sprinkle> yay symphony
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Caramel X BigMac OTP
<Shamroc> psh
<Shamroc> screw paradox's
<ValtheJean> 2,14 g3.6 is only fun to tease the chat with
<twilight_sprinkle> ive been waitign for a symphone stream
<Phase4> all good mods are bad mods but not all bad mods are good mods?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 G3.5 on the other hand is adorable
<ScootaChicken> S&M is best live metal album
<Rain> I know, Val. Im not trying. Just happy to have a head canon trans pony to look up to ^_^
<Ninjazz> I still can't believe you ACTUALLY like it.
<Yahooz> Whats your stance on G2?
<Dovah> ScootaChicken: so i hear u leik cheetos...
<Reikim> I wouldn't. You might get caught in an infinite loop. No wait, that might be a good thing.
<CCCP> Yahooz answer it now!
<Yahooz> meh?
<otakon17> ValtheJean: Those... Things adorable?
<Kandarihu> I offered ValtheJean a download link for the G2 game, but he didn't want to get it like that.
<Rex_Mundi> This song reminds me of western showdowns and cowboys and stuff
<SaxyPretender> 0,14OH FUCKING HELL, I MISSED THE ESCTASY OF GOLD
<CCCP> Yahooz please please please
<Reikim> Anyway

<DoctoDoctorWho> ScootaChicken: ment to be me, not dovah there.
<ScootaChicken> otakon17: One man's adorable is another man's horror, like how you seem to find girls with bodies like men attractive whilst I find them rather intimidating.
<Jmo> <3
<Kawaii_icybeauti> hey thelonepony
<Malmortius> So are MLP episodes ever actually played here? Lol
<Reikim> Any mod who becomes "defined" by one of the above is not doing his/her job.
