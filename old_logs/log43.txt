*Dermathil 0brohoofs NewDCD
<Colgate> And that´s the story on how equestria was made
<Ghosties> 4I wonder if the aliens dropped any good loot
<Delacrux> This begins a new era. Of shacking hair back and forth.
<TenchiFreak5> And once again, the day is saved.
<Nittany_Tiger> And they forgot to pick Luna up on the way home.
<DeadlyPony> Hrreeeh

<Axel_Foaley> You got a potion for killing the aliens
<andytags2> TL;DW
<Sol> +1 cigar
<charmin> sklar
<Explorer> theres bound ot be thousands of alien survivors, they would prolly have to deal with all of them, like a ground war, sounds like a good campaign for a FPS
<DeadlyPony> Tht kid is a idiot.
<Colgate> I wonder if there´s any liquor in the wreckages
<R_Zack> Sounds more like how the humans prevented an invasion to Equestria
<GabeMoist> And meteors killed everyone
<GabeMoist> The End
<RenegadeBrony> Yay genocide=fireworks
<Shizzy> cigar has +10 charisma
<R_Zack> when they killed the aliens first
<Sol> Slut
<TenchiFreak5> Rocks fall everyone dies.
<DragonRage> I'd play a game like that.

<nomnomgiggity> orion
<Ghosties> DCD, what are you doing?
<Lios> Colors for mods makes more sense.
<guest9001> BOTH
<RainBroDash> Colours for mods!
<R_Zack> READ A BOOK
<Ghosties> Mods have colors for reasons
<Pikaru> I prefer us normal folk to use white.
<Explorer> Colors for modes is good
<R_Zack> Classic.
<Potatojack> Mods using colors makes it easy to spot mod comments'
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Colours for mods, deffo
<Hipster_Brony> sigh, come on DCD...
<NewDCD> exactly
<Hipster_Brony> why the fuck would he post that?
<R_Zack> Kudos to the person who made the pink pony intro
<RenegadeBrony> 0I like colors being for mods, when I first joined I didn't understand why, the next time I came and we hit critical mass, it became clear like THAT.
<RainBroDash> Because then individual mods can be told apart a lot easier NewDCD, it's just a shitload easier that way, and a lot less eyesoreish
<Explorer> can u default it
<DubstepMaster> it's raining candy
<Ghosties> *shrugs* That's what I want to know

<SirSprinkles> 6But if I'm going to play eps, at all, it'll be the ones from this week.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10TTEchidna can you see if Darkeiya can come on?

<Ascendant> let me exit it for a bit
<Ghosties> I already have an OC, actually
<Ghosties> Someone from Ponychan made me one
<SirSprinkles> That's what I'm saying.
<Errannar> what's the emote tag for chat, /e?
<SirSprinkles> Our OCs.
<Lios> /me
<Errannar> ah, thanks
<SirSprinkles> Most of us have one.
<Ghosties> We could ask Bling, he's the one who made me mine
<Ascendant> installing screen atm
<Quanyails> 7Mmm'kay.
<Lolipop_of_Doom> How many more minutes?
<Armageddon> derp
<SirSprinkles> 6 2
<Potatojack> Fifty-five
<GoldenDragon> oh lordy
<prince-dari> .com seems to usually be free for just a year.
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Damn x3
<SirSprinkles> 6I wonder if this is on loop.
<SirSprinkles> 6It is our new "closing time" music. :p
<andytags> YES
<Sneas> 03http://www.weebls-stuff.com/flash/patrick.swf
<Errannar> hene
*Sneas hides
<Errannar> *hehe
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10i hope we can start
<GoldenDragon> noooo
<maxaminusone> That's not a bad idea.
<Errannar> wow, stupid typo's
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Only for this month. K?
<GoldenDragon> fluttershy's lulaby for 10 minutes should be the closing
<SirSprinkles> 6Probably only for a short while.
<SirSprinkles> 6We'll probably shift around.
<SirSprinkles> 6LOLOOP
<Quanyails> 7I will be going to sleep soon.
<maxaminusone> I can't stop watching for some reason.
<Errannar> ahahaa
<Ascendant> alright
<Ascendant> try it
<Quanyails> 7If you want to put a note on the TF2 topic on TST it's up.
<Lolipop_of_Doom> BT
<Ascendant> uh
<Lolipop_of_Doom> If you see that Bubble box thing
<Bjornfot> 0I'm enjoying this.
<Lolipop_of_Doom> On the down on the video
<Ghosties> 4I for one love our new "closing time" music
<Potatojack> You have been watching Late Night Brony State, sponsored by the Quill & Sofa Store.
<Lolipop_of_Doom> It means its looping
<Quanyails> 7And no password, or am I missing something?
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Wheres the Announcments?
<SirSprinkles> 6No closing announcements tonight.
<SirSprinkles> 6Nothing of any significant importance.
<Lolipop_of_Doom> okay.jpg
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> let me check
<Botuts> ..
<SirSprinkles> 6Other than that we're showing Saving Private Ryan tomorrow at 8 PM EST.
<Aurora> 6this is making me want to play TF2 again today
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<Ascendant> never played it
<Lolipop_of_Doom> In honnor of July 4th
<Bjornfot> 0well, see you all then
<Lolipop_of_Doom> *Honor
<drf|laptop> 03I refuse to play it on concept
<Quanyails> 7Thank you for setting a server though. :)
<Ascendant> apparently hl2 which I assume is half life 2
<Ascendant> is also there
<drf|laptop> 03because ew highly addicting games
<Bjornfot> 0*honour
<Ghosties> 4I know I'm late, but, *points to Potatojack* I like that idea
<NightSeas> 12lol
<Quanyails> 7Well, the engine.
<prince-dari> Mostly .com, .net and the like are only free for a year, after which you have to renew by paying, or redo surveys and offers, etc, you did to get the domain in the first place.
<prince-dari> .cc.co should just be free permenantly with no input required.
<Lolipop_of_Doom> This is bront state, and we are OUT!
<Sol> Spike's bulge still disturbs me....
<Lolipop_of_Doom> *Brony
<Ghosties> Huh, I wonder what the other guys think then
<Ascendant> uh
<SirSprinkles> I honestly don't care, it's not like we should have any issue with it being .cc.co
<Ascendant> gonna restart it again Quanyails
<Quanyails> 7Okay,.
<Botuts> What are they using to record?
<Ascendant> damnit SSH, stop lagging
<Silverscreen> I honestly don't care either.
<Errannar> bront > brontosaurus > my prehistoric pony?
<Silverscreen> if it works, it works.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10TTEchidna Spyrorocks[Air] you guys here?
<prince-dari> Fine I'll get that.
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<prince-dari> For hosting there's one with 1.5 GB disk space and 100GB/month data transfer for free.
<prince-dari> 5 sub domains and addon domains.
<Ascendant> try it?
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Quanyails> 7Last time before I sleep for the night. :)
<SirSprinkles> That's not bad, for the purpose we'd be using it for.
<Ghosties> Got the email
<Ghosties> Awesome, I'm glad they took down the logo
<prince-dari> It'd also come with 5 email accounts.
<Errannar> this tune is so relaxing
<Ascendant> no password still?
<Ascendant> unless rcon_password is the admin password
<SirSprinkles> We don't really need email accounts, but that's cool I suppose.
<Potatojack> I thought I was joking when I said it goes for 55 more minutes.
<GoldenDragon> this is the song that never ends
<SirSprinkles> 6It's on loop, so technically it never ends.
<GoldenDragon> yes it goes on and on my friend
<NightSeas> 12Hello AntWhite
<SirSprinkles> 6But it's only 10 minutes long.
<RainBroDash> just gonna throw this out there: The world needs more RBDxVinyl Scratch and/or OctaviaxVinyl Sctratch shipfics. H8rz feel free to h8.
<Explorer> booom
<Explorer> da da da
<Quanyails> 7sv_password?
<Ascendant> may
<Ascendant> be
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Is is gonna be OFF AIR soon?
<RainBroDash> and SirSprinkles I gave up on the sax a few loops ago, been listening to my 'holy fuck I'm awesome' playlist
<Explorer> needs more luna
<Ascendant> ah
<Ascendant> rcon_password is the admin password
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, once this vid finishes.
<Ascendant> right, so, I'll set that as something more secure
<Ascendant> and give it to you
<Bjornfot> 0>once it finishes
<Bjornfot> 0>it loops
<Bjornfot> 0TROOLOLOLOLOLOLO
<Ascendant> and yeah it's sv_password
<SirSprinkles> 6:D
<Explorer> no bar
<Ascendant> must have missed that
<Nittany_Tiger> Lulz at the Vinyl Scratch Tapes. I read them all last night.
<RainBroDash> "technically it never ends" -> "once this vid finishes"
<Quanyails> 7All right.
<Explorer> well be here for a million years
<RainBroDash> Nittany_Tiger, me gusta mucho
<Quanyails> 7I'll give it one more try, then.
<SirSprinkles> 6FOREEEEVER!
<Ascendant> yeah let me configure it
<Bjornfot> 0i'm gonna listen to this aaaaaaaaaaaaaall night
<Explorer> forever!
<Potatojack> It will keep playing until tomorrow night's movie.
<Nittany_Tiger> I wonder if Vinyl is really like she is in the fanfic, though.
<Errannar> he's pulling a pinkie pie on us
<Explorer> naw
<RainBroDash> well technically Vinyl is completely undefined
<Explorer> ooo
<Sol> D'oh!
<Ghosties> 4Thanks for coming guys
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, that's all folks.
<RainBroDash> I think that's why she makes such a good fanfic character
<Bjornfot> 0NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Ghosties> 4We hope to see you tomorrow! :D
<Potatojack> So far we have to guess what Vinyl is like.
<Bjornfot> 0@Ghosties that's what she said
<Explorer> yay! i bean boo!
<Explorer> mean
<Errannar> had fun
<SirSprinkles> 6You don't have to go home, but... well, I guess you can stay here as long as you're not causing trouble.
<andytags> k guys, this was fun
<RainBroDash> Cheers for the streaming Sprinks as always, and thanks mods <3 I'll be hitting the hay
<Ghosties> 4Shame on SirSprinkles
<Ghosties> 4He used my saying
<Explorer> time for cuddles!
<Sol> Orgy tiem?
<Bjornfot> 0oh gawd
<SirSprinkles> 6And we'll KNOW if you caused trouble, so seriously, don't.
<andytags> can... can i used colored text once before I leave?
<Bjornfot> 0inb4 bronypile
<SirSprinkles> 6If you want to be kicked for it. :p
<Potatojack> Closing time, one last call for alchol, so finish your whiskey or beer
<Ascendant> alright, gonna restart, Quan
<prince-dari> andytags: I usually turn off the coolour script when pretty much everyone has left.
<prince-dari> colour*
<Nittany_Tiger> I think Vinyl is somewhat less than that
<Ascendant> jesus christ screen just screwed up again
<Nittany_Tiger> in the Fanfic.
<andytags> 0Well, at least if I don't get banned.
<andytags> 0like IP banned
<HyperMetalLugia> Whatcha running on :P
<Errannar> I'll be hitting the hay as well, good night (well, morning in my case :/)
<Ascendant> does screen exist on windows? no
<Explorer> time for after dark
<andytags> 0:P
<HyperMetalLugia> Well you can see a window screen :p
<Sol> BMN After Dark?
<Ascendant> I meant the program
<Ghosties> 4DCD's currently playing TF2
<HyperMetalLugia> But poor you ;p

<Explorer> im using my Cats wifi
<Hooh54> 4Hi :3
<Bjornfot> 0>his cat has wifi
<Ghosties> 4Wut
<RainBroDash> To all who desperately want to use coloured text, it's probably best that you just don't, even when the stream isn't bustling, it's just a good practice to uphold the rules of the stream even when it's not entirely necessary
<Hooh54> 4Ascendant, do you know why the chat stats reset?
<andytags> 0pills here
<Bjornfot> 0talk about spoiling your pet
<Ascendant> Yes
<Explorer> color is overrated
<Ascendant> They reset at the end of each month
<Sol> Lawful Good allignment?
<Ascendant> I have screenshots of the old ones
<Hooh54> 4I see
<RainBroDash> Just makes sense dawg sol
<drf|laptop> 03wait
<drf|laptop> 03who's Hooh54

<Sol> inb3kick
<Hooh54> 4Yo Quan
<Ghosties> 4Awww
<Sol> Aw, was too slow
<Ghosties> 4But I liked the viking
<RainBroDash> ^perfect example of pointless chaotic rubbish, no offense :P
<Hooh54> 4I was bored
<Umbreon> 12a guy or a girl
<Umbreon> 12D:

<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Bjornfot> oopsie :3c
<Hooh54> 4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IrUl_-FtLk&feature=related
<Sol> Neutral Good, man
<Hooh54> 4Owai

<Hooh54> 4I I'm a girl

<Umbreon> 12ok
<Ghosties> 4Hey!
<Explorer> Ponify me
<Ghosties> 4You should be taking it up with me!
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't really care, as long as you're not using colors of mods that are currently in the stream.
<Ghosties> 4I was the original mod after all
<SirSprinkles> 6i.e. Red
<Ghosties> 4Hey, Sprinks, do you remember the good ol days?
<Sol> 13SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<SirSprinkles> 6I do.
<Ghosties> 4Sol: Bronypeanut uses pink
<Explorer> i was a mod of a huge gaming server once
<drf|laptop> 03in that case, pix or gtfo
*drf|laptop runs
<Ghosties> 4But man, those were the days. We'd have some new person come into the barren room and I'd say
<Ghosties> 4YOU!
<Aeroslash> night Quan
<Ghosties> 4I AM YOUR GOD HERE!
<prince-dari> Heheh.
<Ascendant> seeya
<Ghosties> 4Man, I miss those days
<RainBroDash> Superseded by mods... damn. Well, I'd still say it's silly to use colours at all at any time if you're not a mod, but that's just silly old rainbrodash talking :P
<SirSprinkles> 6You mean like, a month ago? XD
<Bjornfot> IS there any color any mod doesn't use?
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm a mod of a forum.
<Ghosties> 4Exactly, the good ol days lol
<SirSprinkles> 6There are some colors.
<Lolipop_of_Doom> BROADCAST THE STREAM AGAIN
<SirSprinkles> 6Not many though.
<Nittany_Tiger> A mod with a banstick (not all mods get bansticks on this forum).
<Explorer> use black text
<Lolipop_of_Doom> SHOW AFTER DARK
<Ascendant> !dns tf2.nightshadow.co.cc
<ScriptBot> Resolved tf2.nightshadow.co.cc to: 64.37.49.28
<Ascendant> k
<NightSeas> 12Good night Quanyails
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, I'm off. I hunger for food.
<Hooh54> 4No pix for u
<Nittany_Tiger> It gets used extensively on adbots and spambots.
<prince-dari> I'm not sure if my internet is good enough to stream for you guys. :P
<drf|laptop> 03:<
<May> 14oh, Ascendant, that like you gave me to the CS3 torrent didn't start downloading at all when I got it
<SirSprinkles> 6And more cigarettes...
<prince-dari> I can stream to my laptop next door though.
<prince-dari> XD
<Hooh54> 4You'd be surprised
<prince-dari> Cya later then Sprinkles.
<Ghosties> 4Alright Sprinks. Have a good night, man
<SirSprinkles> 6cya

<NightSeas> 12Hello Hooh
<Hooh54> 4Hi!
<Bjornfot> holy.shit.
<Ascendant> Uh, May, what are you using to download the torrent?
<May> 14Vuze
<Armageddon> :o
<May> 14I use it mostly for downloading animes to watch
<Bjornfot> 10This colour makes me wanna puke.
<Sneas> o:
<Ascendant> EW
<Ascendant> Vuze lags like crap
<Ascendant> use bittorrent
<Bjornfot> night
<Ascendant> it took me nearly two weeks to download KH1's iso of 2.83GB using VUZE
<Ascendant> the max speed was 12kbps
<prince-dari> lolfail
<Sol> I'll never trust Sprinkles with colors again ><
<May> 14uhm
<May> 14okay
<May> 14I'll get that then
<Ascendant> derp

<DSD|Spyropedia> 10hey
<drf|laptop> 03EW THAT FACE
<Ascendant> /care
<drf|laptop> 03Why is it that new people just randomly come in here and use it
<NightSeas> 12D: I want one
<drf|laptop> 03is someone brainwashing our members? :/
<Lolipop_of_Doom> ITS AFTER DARK SHOW PONIES
<Darkeiya> Howdy~
<NightSeas> 12It's Kyu!
<Ascendant> rofl
*NightSeas runs
<Ascendant> drf
<Ascendant> if we were using inspircd
<Explorer> woop woop
<Ascendant> we could configure it so that o3o = o.o
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Ascendant> except I HATE inspircd
<drf|laptop> 03YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO MAKE THAT PUBLIC FFS
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10so
<Ascendant> and that crap takes me half an hour to configure
<prince-dari> You can try and bug DCD to stream something. :P
<Ascendant> XD
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10i guess it's just as who is here
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10ok so lets start
<Darkeiya> Alright.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10How often do we want meetings?
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Like this
<Hooh54> 4I'm doubletasking like crazy
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10once a month every two weeks? what?
<Hooh54> 4*multitasking
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm re-watching pony episodes right now. I'm fine.
<Ascendant> yeah and really, everyone cares :3
<Darkeiya> I'd be fine with once every two weeks. Frankly, most any time is good.
<Darkeiya> At least, for me.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10ok
<Explorer> A went to B then went to C then to D then to E and F and G
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Same here
<prince-dari> I could stream stuff if I asked DCD for the details.
<Silverscreen> Guys...um...I got a problem...
<Silverscreen> How do I embed the stream into here?
<Explorer> pony vectors on deviant art
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10what day?
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10also time
<Silverscreen> I redid the site, but it's missing the stream.
<Silverscreen> I just have the chat.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10if i have something i need to do most of the time i'm back 4 to 7 pm your time
<prince-dari> I'll get you the link.
<Hooh54> 4Lol
<Darkeiya> Any time past 7pm is good for me on most days.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Just to let you you don't have to be there
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10ok
<Darkeiya> I tend to be on during the day as well, but schedules tend to shift around a lot, y'know?
<prince-dari> <script type="text/javascript"> fid="BronyState"; v_width="700"; v_height="520";</script>
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10yes
<prince-dari> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://veemi.com/javascript/embedPlayer.js"></script>
<prince-dari> <iframe width="700" height="520" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" src="http://www.veemi.com/embed.php?v=BronyState&amp;vw=700&amp;vh=520&amp;domain=www.dinkypage.com"></iframe>
<prince-dari> I think that's it.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10how about next weekend?
<Silverscreen> IT WORKS!
<Silverscreen> *saves*
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Also can you get rid of this? http://www.spyropedia.com/wiki/File:Cynder.jpg
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10it's the cynder jpg
<Darkeiya> I should be available then, and sure thing.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10not teh small but the cynder.jpg
<Darkeiya> Yeah.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10*the
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10ok next
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10pages that we need/keep/delete
<Silverscreen> ...there's two of them.
<Silverscreen> That code you gave me gives me two of the same stream. XD
<Darkeiya> Elaborate a little, please?
<prince-dari> Dunno then, I just took that from the source of the old page.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10ok we are gonig to go over stuff we need or we have to keep or we can get rid of
<Darkeiya> Ah, okay.
<TTEchidna> Can we get rid of Cynder?
<TTEchidna> Okay.
<TTEchidna> Will do.
<Darkeiya> Josh. :|
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10you mean the page?
<TTEchidna> Oh wait Vivendi already killed her.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10no
<TTEchidna> Just like they killed Elora.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10it was an image
<Darkeiya> Ignore him. He's being an idiot.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10kk
<TTEchidna> VIVENDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
<Darkeiya> Alright, pages we need.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Contact Us/staff
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10we need that
<Darkeiya> Yes.
<TTEchidna> Contact with our staff.
<TTEchidna> That's inappropriate.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10>.>
<TTEchidna> I'm trying to think of ways to redesign the main page.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10ok so staff our
<TTEchidna> But I need GRAFFIXS
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10*are
<NightSeas> 12bbl
<Darkeiya> I know Uxie was attempting to write up a Manual of Style, too.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Darkeiya (admin) TTEchidna (bureaucrat) Spyrorocks[Air] (bureaucrat)
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Well we can do that when we can get a hold of her
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10so thats our staff
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Next do we want fanon/fandom/fanfics?
<Darkeiya> I'd personally try to avoid fanon and fanfiction, since then we'll have any random shmuck coming in to advertise their fanfic.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10ok
<Darkeiya> Fandom... I'm a little iffy about. An article on fandom in general *might* be alright, but it'd be a matter of trying to figure out how to handle it.
<Darkeiya> I'd say for the moment, we'll leave that be and get back to it later.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10ok
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Featured Articles
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10we neeed to run this
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Like run this good
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10So FA should be for good pages
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10That are not stubs or stuff like that
<Darkeiya> Yeah.
<TTEchidna> Oh featured articles.
<TTEchidna> How I loathe you.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10>.>
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10I think we can get some good pages up there
<TTEchidna> Because then what ends up happening anywhere but Wikipedia is that there's never enough good articles.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10also it needs a good image to be a FA
<TTEchidna> Good image?
<TTEchidna> From a PS1 game?
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10i png file
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10and not fanon
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10and try for a full shot
<TTEchidna> No Spyro was never on PS2. There was one beta game that never made it out of development, and then the series ended.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10no like a pic of their head
<Darkeiya> Yeah.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Also is TTE ok?
<TTEchidna> What we need is to fix up the game articles, too...
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Well yes
<TTEchidna> And am I okay?
<TTEchidna> OF COUUUUURSE
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10But we need a MoS
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10so we know what we are doing
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10So we have a guideline
<TTEchidna> My sarcasm is evident though. BECAAAAAUSE I blame Vivendi for everything.
<TTEchidna> Bastards. Greedy corporate bastards.
<TTEchidna> Same with Craptivision.
<Darkeiya> I told you, Josh, enough of that bullshit.
<TTEchidna> NEVAR
<Darkeiya> Either get with the program or shut the fuck up.
<Darkeiya> Now, back to the actual topic at hand instead of your childish ranting...
<Hooh54> 4Bye!
<Darkeiya> Yes. A Manual of Style will definitely be necessary.
<TTEchidna> What would we put in the MoS, though, aside from "don't fail at grammar"?
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10>.>
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10How a page should look and what it should have
<TTEchidna> Same issue we encountered at Bulbapedia. There's no real... anything.
<TTEchidna> It all depends on the page itself.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Right
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10We should have different stuff for the different pages their are
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10like maybe story and history for the characters
<TTEchidna> Maybe.
<Darkeiya> I'm also vouching for quotes (or at least, any text box dialogue).
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Yes we should have that
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Also a sub page for images
<TTEchidna> Now THOSE...
<TTEchidna> Quotes...
<TTEchidna> I can make a template for.
<TTEchidna> Make it in the style of Spyro 2/3 boxes.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page this is where i come from
<TTEchidna> Because AHT's were lame, Spyro 1's had UNREADABLE FONT...
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10and it works
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10>.>
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Anyways before it went down we were doing good
<TTEchidna> ...get that picture of Bentley off there. That's not Bentley.
<Darkeiya> Josh, enough.
<TTEchidna> But it's not.
<TTEchidna> Looks more like Robin Williams.
<Darkeiya> I've got more reason to have my heart sink at that than you do, but even I can suck it up and focus on the important.
<Ascendant> wb
<TTEchidna> more like sheila can suck it up
<TTEchidna> *snicker*
<Darkeiya> >:|
<Darkeiya> EITHER WAY
<TTEchidna> :D
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Gallery:Jupiter_Dragon_Traps pages like this
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10This good page
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10It shows what the enemy looks like
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10it also has their attacks and them sleeping
<TTEchidna> True.
<Darkeiya> That could be doable in one of those enemy tables you were thinking of, right?
<May> 14thanks :>
<Darkeiya> Like, maybe have a parameter.
*Ascendant freezes
<TTEchidna> I suppose.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10it really shows how they look and act
*May defrosts
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Also how you die
<Axel_Foaley> O good. My electricity came back on. People are still here?
<Darkeiya> (Also also, does anyone have a problem if I delete the Timeline article?)
<Hooh54> 4Did Articuno use Sheer Cold on you?
<TTEchidna> But remember, we shouldn't attempt to be something we're not. And what we'd be is informative, not an excuse not to play the games...
<Axel_Foaley> nice banner, btw
<TTEchidna> Timeline?
<TTEchidna> There's three.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10not really
<TTEchidna> Maybe four.
<TTEchidna> Kill it.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10If we have to we can do it again
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Dragon_Eggs
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10So for the most part i did that
<TTEchidna> And... why's it a Jupiter Dragon Trap... I mean. Was that name officially used?
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10i'm not really sure
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10I think Uxie knows more
<TTEchidna> I know after EtD that Vivendi laid on the bad puns thick...
<Ascendant> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Ascendant, you are a 3Lugia.
<Ascendant> :O
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10I just get the pics and text
<TTEchidna> PS2 emulator?
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10no
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Gamecube
<HyperMetalLugia> wat
<HyperMetalLugia> Ironic
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Dolphin
<HyperMetalLugia> !pokemon
<Hooh54> 4!pokemon
<ScriptBot> HyperMetalLugia, you are a 14Igglybuff.
<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 7Jumpluff.
<HyperMetalLugia> OHWOW
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10MY PS2 emu lags to much
<Hooh54> 4Pluff buff
<Darkeiya> Also, that is a fantastic Dragon Egg article.
<Ascendant> haha
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Thanks
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10See this is what i am aming for
<Ascendant> and how is me being a Lugia ironic, HML?
<Hooh54> 4Ascendant wow o-o
<Ascendant> what, Hooh54?
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10That is the type of page we need
<Hooh54> 4You got Lugia
<Ascendant> lol
<Darkeiya> Yes.
<Darkeiya> I can already say, in terms of needed information...
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10http://www.spyropedia.com/wiki/Zoe_%28Fairy%29 not this
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Weird how it adds the %
<Darkeiya> %28 is the code for a parenthesis, I think.
<Darkeiya> Either way, I concur whole-heartedly. I've been meaning to add more to her article.
<Hooh54> 4The only good Pokemon I ever got was Espeon
<Ascendant> lol
<Umbreon> 12sigh Ascendant
<Ascendant> heya Umbreon ;p
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10same
<Umbreon> 12it feels odd to have a usb keyboard for a laptop
<Umbreon> 12XD
<Ascendant> ._.
<Ascendant> yeah I imagine it would
<TTEchidna> %28 is open parenthesis, %29 is close parenthesis. Does that for all non-alphanumeric characters.
<Ascendant> XD
<Hooh54> 4.-.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10I mean that right there is not what we want
<Darkeiya> Yeah.
<TTEchidna> ...hmm, GCN emulator?
<Ascendant> but hey, I love my laptop's keyboard
<Umbreon> 12i think it's odd enough my friends use a usb mouse for their laptops
<TTEchidna> Run from GCN discs or what?
<Umbreon> 12Ascendant XD
<Ascendant> I hate USB mouses
<Umbreon> 12it's so hard to type messages
<Umbreon> 12when your spacebar and E keys fail on you
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10no
<TTEchidna> Because I got the PS1 Spyro screens straight off my own copies of Spyro 1, 2, and 3.
<Hooh54> 4tRUE
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10I got the file
<Hooh54> 4*True
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10:)
<TTEchidna> Ah.
<Umbreon> 12allyourmssagscomoutlikthis
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10ok so Darkeiya lets starts a test run
<TTEchidna> Well, like I care. AHT was developed on the GCN anyway, which is why they fucked up and flipped Flame/Charge in the PS2 version.
<TTEchidna> Probably because the GCN version of EtD crashed less.
<Ascendant> XD
<TTEchidna> Hmm...
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10ok we have seen both egg pages
<TTEchidna> Any of you guys have Dropbox?
<Ascendant> !chatstats
<Cone> Chat stats updating.
<TTEchidna> Or have I already pushed it on you?
<Hooh54> 4allyourmessagesarebelongtousb
<Ascendant> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Ascendant, you are a 13Geodude.
<Darkeiya> Alright, the Egg page.
<Hooh54> 4XD
<Ascendant> lol
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10i don't even know what that is
<Ascendant> honestly
<Hooh54> 4Geodudette
<Ascendant> don't make me say the same things I say to SilverSonic to you, Hooh54
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10lets try a test on fusing them into one
<Ascendant> Man, the amount of people who try too hard...
<Darkeiya> tl;dr Dropbox is a file-sharing system.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Dragon_Eggs http://www.spyropedia.com/wiki/Dragon_Eggs
<Darkeiya> Alright.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10oh ok
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10ok so from what i can see
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Spyropedia has about the same info as shout
<eXAKR> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> eXAKR, you are a 9Piplup.
<eXAKR> !digimon
<ScriptBot> eXAKR, you are a 9Ebemon X.
<TTEchidna> Just not extended into a walkthrough.
<Darkeiya> I'll merge the text to my best, anyway.
<Darkeiya> Gimme a few minutes.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10now i like your guys pic at the top right better then ours
<TTEchidna> Dragon egg locations, likely should be on their own pages.
<Umbreon> 12LOL
<Hooh54> 4!digimon
<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 6IceLeomon.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Just go to edit then cop and paste and we can do the images
<TTEchidna> List of dragon eggs in Spyro: Year of the Dragon, etc.
<Umbreon> 12this works i just laid the keyboard over the laptop keyboard
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10sub page?
<TTEchidna> Nah, separate pages.
<TTEchidna> Categorized as Lists of collectibles.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10wouldn't it be easy to just have it as a sub page?
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10Like List of Spyro: A hero's tail Eggs
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10maybe add a /
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10for a sub
<Darkeiya> That's actually what we were going to do for the later ones. List of Dragons in Spyro: Year of the Dragon and so on.
<Darkeiya> Might be Dragon Eggs. Hm.
<TTEchidna> Well.
<TTEchidna> Regardless.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10ok
<TTEchidna> List of (x) in (y), (x) being the item, (y) being the game.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10yea that would work
<TTEchidna> (x) being times you can touch Bianca's boobs, (y) being when you're playing as Hunter.
<TTEchidna> This category is empty.
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10>.>
<DSD|Spyropedia> 10......
<TTEchidna> Scuba diving.
<TTEchidna> ANYWAY I'm gonna make a game template.

<RainBroDash> hey apok, hows it going?
<Apokalipse> pretty good
<Apokalipse> I see you're still here
<Apokalipse> instead of being productive so I don't have to be
<RainBroDash> heh
<ChaoAqua> 2anyone give me three random pokemon that would make a good team (two PKMN is ok)
<Apokalipse> I was very productive
<Apokalipse> I played Terraria
<HyperMetalLugia> Get a snorlax, magikarp and a cascoon
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<RainBroDash> soo productive ;D
<Apokalipse> You bet
<RainbowDash> fuck you rainbro
<ChaoAqua> 2ok :)
<RainBroDash> Fuck you too man :)
<ChaoAqua> 2meh, what kind of name could ateam like that have???
<RainbowDash> :)
<ChaoAqua> 2*a team
<prince-dari> If you guys want to do that, you should go get a room, I don't want to see this. :P
<Dermathil> Hey Apok. Yes I was productive, btw. Finally gave myself a big enough kick in the flank to start the writing process on my first fanfic that's been trotting in the spotlight of my brain since Mid-May.
<RainbowDash> so what is this?
<Apokalipse> Nice
<Dermathil> *cough* Conversion Bureau stuff.
<RainBroDash> Dari you love it. I bet mod chat is just full of cyb0r anyway ;)
<Dermathil> Ohai Silver
<RainBroDash> ohai silver
<eat911> hi silver
<Apokalipse> silver just came back from mod cyb0r
<RainBroDash> :D
<prince-dari> Shh, you're not supposed to know about that.
<Silverscreen> 11what?
<Hipster_Brony> 8o hai silver
<Silverscreen> 11hello
<Dermathil> ohai Hipster
<Apokalipse> I mean, hi Silver
<RainBroDash> hehe
<Quanyails> 7Hmm... Gengar, Latios, and DW Blaziken? :P
<Silverscreen> 11Hi, Dermathil
<ChaoAqua> 2lawl, meh, not Latios (seen too much of him X.X)
<Quanyails> 7Eh, all right.
<Quanyails> 7Gengar is fun in 3 on 3s with fast attacks and Destiny Bond.
<Quanyails> 7Even better if you hack a Custap berry on it.
<ChaoAqua> 2i had 2 triple battles on random match
<Articuno> 12Hi gotta go in two mins but is there anyone here that had problem with the gallery lagging due to the random pics slider at the top?
<ChaoAqua> 2after using dark void, one disconnected
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<ChaoAqua> 2the other just switched the 3 sleeping PKMN
<Quanyails> 7Whimsicott + Terrakion.
<Quanyails> 7Or Weavile + Terrakion.
<Quanyails> 7Or Houndoom + Terrakion. :P
<ChaoAqua> 2well, i haven't been to the gallery so....................
<Articuno> 12Yeh... anyone that has??
<Articuno> 12If so, PM me if it's still lagging or not, gtg
<Quanyails> 7ARTI
<Quanyails> 7Wait:
<Apokalipse> The best change Silver made by far is centering everything
<Quanyails> 7I apparently don't have moderator access to the galleries?
*Aurora snugs in articuno's tail
<Apokalipse> having the site lopsided to the left bothered me
<RainBroDash> ^I second that
<Apokalipse> I'm serious
<Espeon> 06o.o
<Silverscreen> 11Centering is good for keeping things in order, but if it's used for everything, it can change from looking good to barely readable. Though that's mainly when it comes to text.
<HyperMetalLugia> Fun o.o
<Apokalipse> yeah, there isn't much text on this site
<Apokalipse> so it works
<ChaoAqua> 2anywayz, after he switched, they also fell asleep (DV) and one got paralyzed. THAT'S when he disconnected
<ChaoAqua> 2sore losers >:<
<ChaoAqua> 2and they both happened to be from california
<ChaoAqua> 2Osha-Hello Obsi
<RainBroDash> would anypony care to see the horribly alpha stages of my OC RainBroDash pony?
<eat911> sure
<Silverscreen> 11Sure.
<Obsi> Hihi

<RainBroDash> eep, hold on uploading somewhere
<RainBroDash> http://i.imgur.com/GHFB8.png
<RainBroDash> has a lot of work that needs to be done to it
<Apokalipse> I made an OC pony with tempera paints. I have no idea why because the tempera bit made it unnecesarilly harder to make
<ChaoAqua> 2Haha
<Silverscreen> 11Very Nice.
<RainBroDash> and I'm appalling at photoshop (as you might be able to tell)
<prince-dari> Lol, stop putting yourself down, it looks good. :P
<Apokalipse> Looks nice

<prince-dari> I have so much pony on my photobucket.
<Apokalipse> actually it's in my picasa gallery...
<RainBroDash> I just thought I'd try my hand at making something in photoshop, and kill 2 birds with one stone by making this (just in case I ever need a RainBroDash display pic or anything)
<ChaoAqua> 2IT'S BEEN TOO SILENT FOR TOO LONG!!!!!
<Lati> 12POCKETS

<mib_df65l6> While chat isn't too crowded, is there any plan to stream new episodes next season here?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes
<Hipster_Brony> 8we will be streaming new episodes live
<Tyranico> That's awesome
<mib_df65l6> :D
<ChaoAqua> 2Osha-what???
<Tyranico> I love the redesign for this site
<RainBroDash> will be epic
<RainBroDash> and yeah tyranico, silver did it today :D
<Tyranico> Well he did a great job :)
<Lati> 12Oshawott
*Lati runs
*ChaoAqua 2chases
<mib_df65l6> I like the redesign a lot.
<mib_df65l6> Its pretty good
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes, thank Silverscreen for the awesome redesign
<Silverscreen> 11You're welcome.
<mib_df65l6> So have any official release dates been revealed for season 2?
<Dermathil> nope
<mib_df65l6> Oh yeah and cool redesign Silverscreen
<Silverscreen> 11nothing other than what we already know.
<mib_df65l6> I would assume it would be about the same time as last year, but if that was the case they probably would have told us already
<mib_df65l6> since theres really only like 3 months left
<mib_df65l6> thoughts?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i doubt we will hear any definitive release dates until near the end of summer
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont even think they have the first episode of the season completely done yet
<RainBroDash> But there has been a private showing of the first episode to a family member of (I think) a lead animator/director/someone important
<RainBroDash> (not disagreeing with you hipster, im sure it wasn't 100% complete too, just saying)
<RainBroDash> tl;dr ALL IS HOPEFUL
<mib_df65l6> the director showed it to his daughter.
<mib_df65l6> I heard about that
<RainBroDash> ^that
<Elision> yeah what RBD said

<mib_8cjw5n> I didn't think that was a reason to be kicked :/
<mib_8cjw5n> wrong smiley:(
<Elision> op abuse: yopu're doing it right
<Silverscreen> 11Outside of regular BMN, we kick as we please, usually out of fun.
<mib_8cjw5n> grrr
<Silverscreen> 11grr :P
<mib_8cjw5n> actually I cant blame you. I would probably do the same.
<Silverscreen> 11Like I said, it's all in good fun, though.
<Silverscreen> 11Nothing meant by it.
<mib_8cjw5n> So I'm guessing thats a no on the color thing:P
<Silverscreen> 11Try it. >: )
<Kitten> mmmm
<mib_8cjw5n> 0THE TEMPTATION IS UNBEARABLE!!!!
<Hipster_Brony> 8We kick for the enjoyment we anticipate experiencing after performing said activity sometimes
<Silverscreen> 11What hipster said.
<Hipster_Brony> 8if we're kicking you for cause, we make it clear in the kick message
<mib_8cjw5n> 15*wince
<Silverscreen> 11....that's grey. Technically, Grey isn't a color. It's a shade.
<mib_8cjw5n> 12*wince again
<Silverscreen> 11I used to use that color. Most people said it was hard to read though.
<RainBroDash> it was :P
<RainBroDash> especially for those mammoth paragraphs of trivia
<SilverSonic> I'm back~
<Elision> ARGH
<RainBroDash> but for some reason I also think that colour suits you more..
<Elision> I forgot how redtardly annoying this bridge was
<Silverscreen> 11Thank you.
<Colgate> ´sup everyponie
<Elision> hey colgate
<Silverscreen> 11Allo, Colgate.
<Colgate> Anything fun going on`?

<Colgate> We made a deal, he made me watch an awful movie, and I made him watch an "awful" movie
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Drake
<Hipster_Brony> 8the words "win" and "offers" are randomly links
<Drake> 04Hello HML
<maxaminusone> lol
<RainBroDash> oh yeah saw that
<RainBroDash> i lol'd at BronyState being win though
<Silverscreen> Wow...that's odd.
<Hipster_Brony> 8#winning
<mib_8cjw5n> 0hmm
<Elision> >:U
<Elision> I just fell off the same part of the road twice in a row
<Elision> derp
<Silverscreen> oh wow. XD
<RainBroDash> herpaderp
<Silverscreen> It's because of my browser
<maxaminusone> join #bronystaterequests
<Elision> came really cloe to a third time
<maxaminusone> whoops
<maxaminusone> that didn't work
<RainBroDash> heh
<prince-dari> O_o
<Silver> Derp
<prince-dari> We have this channel?
<Hipster_Brony> o.o
<RainBroDash> wat
<Hipster_Brony> yeah
<RainBroDash> oh i c
<mib_8cjw5n> 0what should I say to my pony-hating friend
<Hipster_Brony> it was for video requests last night
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<Hipster_Brony> and when ponychan was down on friday
<RainBroDash> i have no idea anon
<Hipster_Brony> 8dunno, anon, i wish i knew
<Silverscreen> 11That it's better than the majority of animated crap that's on TV now adays.
<RainBroDash> I've been in that situation it's hard
<Hipster_Brony> 8i tried to convert my best friend, he didnt bite
<RainBroDash> :(
<Colgate> About that, I have another friend, who is really tricky, who begged me to stop after I mentioned MLP. I want to convert him!
<Hipster_Brony> 8only watched 5 mins of fall weather friends before turning it off
<RainBroDash> lol
<Colgate> Nono you have to start with the first episode
<mib_8cjw5n> 0He is under the /b/ induced impression that all bronies are gay. and pedophiles.
<Elision> oops
<Elision> I got stuck in a garage door :(
<Tyranico> I'm trying to get my sister and her husband to watch an episode.
<RainBroDash> >/b/. >call people pedophiles
<RainBroDash> wat
<Hipster_Brony> 8i wanted to start with the least "girly" episode
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol rainbro
<Tyranico> Don't know how to go about it though.
<Colgate> I think that the first episode is the best converting one
<maxaminusone> Hmm, which episode is the most violent?
<Colgate> I mean most of this fandom started watching the first episode
<RainBroDash> I think that because spike steals the limelight from twilight quite a bit, it makes the first one less girly
<mib_8cjw5n> 0I watched the first first. and so on.
<RainBroDash> and thus more bearable
<Colgate> The first one is important, it introduces the characters
<Hipster_Brony> 8me too, i started with the pilot
<Colgate> If you show them any of the other ones, they might get confused
<Silverscreen> 11Same here
<Colgate> And confusion leads to dislike
<maxaminusone> I started with Ep. 5, but that was after I had seen a few mashups already. It was the mashups caught my eye initally.
<Silverscreen> 11Anyway, those link derps on the home site is because I use Google Chrome for my browser, and it does these stupid advertisement links in text.
<maxaminusone> Specifically Reservior Ponies
<mib_8cjw5n> 0true. I just thought it was odd that someone who hangs out on /b/ was calling me a pedo.
<Colgate> I remember how MLP caught my attention, feels like nostalgia already
<NightSeas> 12Hey Drake
<maxaminusone> Ep. 25*
<Drake> 04Heya NightSeas
<RainBroDash> plus it gives them an opportunity to get a 'favourite' pony, since they all get good screentime, and they all show off their character stereotypes strongly. Hence my loving of the RBD raincloud moment, and the RBD falling-over-laughing moment
<RainBroDash> I think the pilot is a good idea
<Silverscreen> 11It's been fixed.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohai NightSeas
<HyperMetalLugia> :3
<Tyranico> I remember lurking on /co/ in early January and seeing MLP related stuff for the first time. I now wish I would have started watching then.
<Colgate> I´m on a lot of art sites, and when new "fads" start I usually dont care, but what struck me with all the MLP fanart and fanfiction was that there was so little porn! The majority of the fanstuff is clean o0
<NightSeas> 12Hello HyperMetalLugia
<mib_8cjw5n> 0I started with the pilot after seeing one clip. It was the "return of Derpy" thing.
<NightSeas> 12:)
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Silverscreen> 11Colgate: Obviously you aren't a furry.
<mib_8cjw5n> 0Are you
<RainBroDash> yeah I've come across a lot of porn
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah.
<mib_8cjw5n> 0silver?
<Colgate> I do enjoy adult art from time to time, but I find it sad when shows and characters get butchered with mindless porn
<Silverscreen> 11Childhood rape. It's what the furry fandom's best known for. : \
<RainBroDash> This is the first series that has got me into fanfiction
<Colgate> So seeing all the clean mlp art made me go ´wut´and it restored some of my faith in humanity
<mib_8cjw5n> 0true. I'm 2% me, 23% furry, and 75% brony.
<mib_8cjw5n> 0roughly speaking
<Colgate> I am a furry though, even if I dont apply the term to myself I think I count as one
<mib_8cjw5n> 0I think the bronys represent the more reasonable side of the furry fandom.
<RainBroDash> i would like to think of an appropriate cutie mark for my OC pony but I can't think of onee D: D: this is infuriating.
<mib_8cjw5n> 0What is your oc like
<RainBroDash> it's RainBroDash in its entirety: here's the beta of it:
<Dman> oh?
<NightSeas> 12!Pokemon
<ScriptBot> NightSeas, you are a 12Sandile.
<RainBroDash> http://imgur.com/vA0Vj
<NightSeas> 12Yay

<HyperMetalLugia> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> HyperMetalLugia, you are a 11Torkoal.
<mib_8cjw5n> 0ha. Ummm... Well obviously something very similar to RDs mark.
<Colgate> The cutie mark should be like Dash´s but with the cloud formed like balls
<mib_8cjw5n> 0but more male
<Dman> does the movie start in an hour and 20 mins?
<RainBroDash> cheers dude, it's for my online rainbrodash identity, I might as well have a display picture to go with it
<mib_8cjw5n> 0^do it
<RainBroDash> LOL COLGATE
<RainBroDash> xD
<Silverscreen> 11I'm a furry and I'm not afraid to admit I enjoy some of the more adult aspects of the fandom, but I prefer the clean art and stories that come out of it, which is pretty damn good if you give it a look.
<mib_8cjw5n> 0^true
<RainBroDash> I like a lot of clean art, like D'aww art and shtuff :3
<Dman> ^fanfics for FiM are amazing
<RainBroDash> ^seconded
<maxaminusone> ^
<Colgate> I´ve read about half of the cupcakes fanfic
<RainBroDash> dman yeah 1hr 15 mins dude
<Silverscreen> 11The D'aww art's been through the roof since MLP started.
<Lati> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Lati, you are a 7Bronzor.
<Elision> Dammit!
<Lati> 12NOoooo
<mib_8cjw5n> 0I think its a place for creative people to express themselves without being ridiculed by society for being gifferent
<Elision> same Silverscreen
<Pinkamina> Umm, but "Sweet Appple Massacre" and "The Horror, Thr Horror" are just terrible...
<Elision> but anyway
<Dman> does this start in a little over an hour?
<Elision> suddenly, rain, thousands of it
<RainBroDash> yes dman
<NightSeas> 12Today I got a Snivy TCG card with my happy meal, along with a Pikachu toy :3

<mib_8cjw5n> 0I live in a socially backwards racist small town that I hate.
*Silverscreen 11doesn't have a favorite BG pony...
<Colgate> You must.... Love and tolerate it!
<Dman> Silverscreen, it's ok, me neither
<NightSeas> 12Well, last time I went I found a Audino card just laying on the floor XD
<RainBroDash> silverscreen's favourite background pony is Vinyl Scratch
<GabeMoist> I needs moar thunder
<Colgate> My fav bg pony happened to be Colgate, hehe
<Elision> I am a big fan of colgate actually :<
*Sol doesn't either
*Dermathil finds the Jetpack song from Kick-Ass to listen to while he writes the prologue to his first fanfic.
<Colgate> Since I wanted to make a facebook pony but all was taken cept´for Colgate
<Silverscreen> 11lol, Dermathil
<Elision> Colgate: I got a colgate custom at bronycon in fact :D
<HyperMetalLugia> Ahh-dee-no
<Colgate> So yeah, there I revealed where I lurk during the days
<HyperMetalLugia> Or something
<RainBroDash> Best ponies: DJ pony, Rainbow pony, Colgate pony.
<Dermathil> fav bg pony is Derpy
<Dman> DJ Pon-3?
<Elision> vinyl scratch and octavia also have nice designs to draw
<Dermathil> fav speaking role is Zecora
<Dman> Zecora, man

<Elision> ooh draw the wonderbolts Colgate
<RainBroDash> vinyl scratchxOctavia is like my favourite ship at the moment O_O
<Colgate> And the bronies, hang out too! Cause´ they know we´re awesome fillies!
<NightSeas> 12condition*
<mib_8cjw5n> 0my fav bg is... prolly spitfire with derpy and dj pon3 tied for second
<Dman> Rainbrodash, is that form that fanfic?
<RainBroDash> vinyl scratch tapes?
<Dman> I think so
<Dman> Yes actually
<mib_8cjw5n> 0^lol
<Colgate> First I want to get the anatomy straight Elision
<Dman> I haven't read it, but it ships them rite?
<RainBroDash> tis a good fanfic dman yeah
<Dman> lol
<Dman> I read one ... called i'd have to look it up
<Colgate> So I´m just going to draw standalone pics of the mane cast for now
<Dermathil> Yes, Zecora is fav speaking role
<Lati> 12whoa nice catch
<Dman> but it ships Dashie and Vinyl
*Silverscreen 11ships AJ with a random male pony from Appleoosa.
<Drake> 04I have 74MG of unused space remaining
<Dman> And it was so well written I can't get it outta my head D:
<Colgate> Green Grapes?
<mib_8cjw5n> 0Today tomorrow, and forever.... just gonna throw that out
*Hipster_Brony 8isn't a fan of shipping
<Dman> Even thou I consider Dash to be straight...for the moment
<RainBroDash> UGH I've read so much DashxVinyl, BUT I NEED MORE
<NightSeas> 12It also came with a small chat showing everycard you can get there :3
<RainBroDash> MOAAR
<Dman> lolnoooooo
<NightSeas> 12chart*
<Dman> no shipping >_<
<Lati> 12extra nice! XD
<mib_8cjw5n> 0Today tomorrow, and forever
<Sol> I only like shipping if it's built up well enough
<Silverscreen> 11I prefer DashxSpitfire.
<RainBroDash> dman uJelly of my homoponies? :3
<Lati> 12It's about time mc donalds started making decent-ish toys again
<RainBroDash> FUCK YES silver!
<Apokalipse> I've once read a shipping fic. Wasn't too bad actually
<GabeMoist> As far as shipping goes, I prefer FedEx
<Dermathil> fav mane 6: all of em. They've ALL grown on me alot. especially Rarity.
<Dman> RainBroDash / other fans of shipping /NOT Hipster_brony: You guys will never see season 2 normally D:
<Colgate> Dash could be bisexual for all we know
<NightSeas> 12Indeed
<mib_8cjw5n> 0She is
<Sol> Fave Mane poney is Random Poney
<Dman> Prove it >_<
<mib_8cjw5n> 0its been proven somewhere
<Sol> *Pony
<Silverscreen> 11Canonly speaking, I believe all the ponies are straight.
<Dermathil> ^^
<Dman> same silverscreen
<Apokalipse> dark fics have a much bigger effect on me than shipping
<RainBroDash> @dman ever since I learned the stars were giant balls of gas thousands of years back in time, it just made them more beautiful to me :)
<Dermathil> Apokalipse, then did you read the pony psychology series?
<Dman> um, what's that got to do with this rainbrodash? I'm a confused little pony rite now
<Apokalipse> not yet
*Hipster_Brony 8is thinking of how Whelp would be posting a link to the Kinsey Scale if he were here
<Silverscreen> 11I figure Fanfics as big "What if" Situations.
<Colgate> Although, by scientific fact there is a larger chance of the pony girls in Equestria to be homo than in our society
<Dman> EEeeyup
<Apokalipse> I read Severing
<Dermathil> ^^ true
<RainBroDash> and yeah silverscreen same. especially since of course not all fanfics correlate
<mib_8cjw5n> 0Faust openly stated there was no canon for dash being straight until they needed it, and there wont be so dash is free to be gay/bi.
<Dermathil> FFF I meants Silver's last line is true
<Dman> anypony read the pony psychology fanfics?
<Dermathil> Dman, I read it
<Dman> lul#
<mib_8cjw5n> 0no
<Dermathil> and loved it
<mib_8cjw5n> 0are they good
<Dman> yea, well, it was good
<Sol> Nope
<Colgate> Look here, since girls are a large majority of the Equestrian population, it is more likely there will be more lesbians than in for example our society
<Dermathil> They are excellent. There may be slight shipping in it but it actually helps the story.
<Apokalipse> I have a big to read list
<Dman> It makes out dash to be bi, AJ and fluttershy to be lesbians and ships them both with dash
<RainBroDash> dman what I mean is, I can still observe season 2 as it is, but having a bit of extra information (true or not true) might make it just a teeency bit even more interesting
<Dman> baaasically
<Elision> the pony psychology series was good but I didn't like the ending
<Dermathil> Dman, there's more to it than that.
<Dman> Ofc, Rainbrodash, my bro, that's what I want too
<Dman> yea i guess dermathil
<Dman> the elements thing
<mib_8cjw5n> 0While we're talking about fanfics
<Dman> and Twilight becoming immorta
<Dman> l
<Dermathil> Elision: did you read the alicorn chapter that came out more recently?
<Dman> I haven't D: is it good?
<Dermathil> yes
<Dman> The story sorta ended, so I didn't read it
<Dermathil> About Celly and Luna
<Dman> oh
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.
<Colgate> I like all characters, I just think that Twilight could need a teeny weeny bit more personality
<Dman> they seemed pretty evil in chapter 6 thou : /
<Dermathil> it goes side-by-side with the main chapters
<mib_8cjw5n> 0nevermind I'm not gonna even mention it.
<RainBroDash> no do it anon, as long as it isn't cupcakes.
<Dman> i'll read it at some point then
<RainBroDash> I wanna know :P
<Dman> CUPCAKES
<RainBroDash> NO DMAN Q_Q
<Dermathil> and now, for the bomb: WHO LIEKS THE CONVERSION BUREAU?
<mib_8cjw5n> 0Yeah
<Dman> RUUUN
<mib_8cjw5n> 0that was it
<SilverSonic> wb Sky
<Apokalipse> Is anyone reading the night that never ended?
<Skylands> 10Thanks
<Dman> Haven't read, but have ERRY STOREE downloaded to word to read at some point, is it good dermathil?
<RainBroDash> ok anon, then might as well just leave it out. it just carries shitloads of controversy whereaver it goes
<Silverscreen> 11Twilight is a bit dull with her personality, : \
<Colgate> So what ages would you give the main cast guys? Faust said somewhere that they are between 13 and 17, but didn´t mention any pony specifically
<mib_8cjw5n> 0ok lets see. I'm a fan of the sad ones, anybody read today, tomorrow, forever?
<Dman> But i liek twilight : /
<mib_8cjw5n> 0Colgate:
<NightSeas> 12Wb as well Skylands
<RainBroDash> ill check my reading list anon, i cant remember
<Dermathil> The Conversion Bureaus and the spin-off fics of it are mostly pretty good.
*Silverscreen 11can't read sadfix.
<Colgate> mib_8cjw5n
<mib_8cjw5n> 0see equestria daily they just posted some scientific post about it
<Dermathil> I'm writing one myself

<Dman> ?
<Colgate> Equestria Daily is huge
<Silverscreen> 11Dman: Yes.

<RainBroDash> nah anon I haven't read Today, Tomorrow, Forever. But I'll mark it for a future read
<Silverscreen> 11I'm easily depressed and don't need it.
<mib_8cjw5n> 0but today tomorrow forever was by far the saddest one ever.
<Apokalipse> ah
<Skylands> 10Hey Drake

<Elision> bubbles didn't make me very sad

<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<mib_8cjw5n> 0Nevermind I remembered another
<Dman> Today Tomorrow Forever is saddest?
<Skylands> 10:3
<Elision> the one that made me the most depressed was the one that has all the old ponies
*HyperMetalLugia hugs

<Angel_Espeon> 13I'll just wait until tomorrow and hope I do a better job then |D
<Lati> 12maybe the reason you don't like is because you draw Espeon's more than anything else and so they have to look better than the previous one?
<Lati> 12XD
<Elision> mib_8cjw5n: that was the frst mlp fic I ever read
<SirSprinkles> Probably just broken on my end then.
<Elision> it's really sad

<mib_8cjw5n> 0but its incomplete
<Sol> *fanfic
<Apokalipse> there can never be enough luna
<Dman> i read the diary one of luna 1000 years ago
<maxaminusone> I loved derpy in Knights of Equestria. She was just awesome.
<Lati> 12There's a kitten on TV and it's soADORABLE
<RainBroDash> I just click 'list by type, A-Z', scroll down to shipping, have some fun :P
<Dman> lol
<mib_8cjw5n> 0Anybody here an artist?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol, I really need to be convinced to watch anime these days, since I normally find other things to do instead |D
<Sol> Yo
<Dman> Sup
<Lati> 12such as?
<Aurora> 6you watched pMMM right?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I should start watching more over the summer
<Sol> I can draw
<RainBroDash> I wish I could do art...
<Dman> I can also draw
<RainBroDash> I really do
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yep :3
<Aurora> 6k good

<Sol> Yes, I've been practicing since 7th grade
<mib_8cjw5n> 0What do you guys use? digital, traditional?
<Dman> I can't ... well, never tried animating, but I dr4w stuff : P
<Angel_Espeon> 13Not even 12 episodes long?
<Dman> I draw in pencil
<Dman> then scan and edit on corel

<Dman> then just colouring in
<Dman> on corel
<Sol> I do traditional, but I want to start digital

<Elision> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-nightfall-at-sweet-apple-acres.html
<Silverscreen> 11Sprinkles, tell us when you have the stream going.
<Sol> I need to get a tablet, coloring with a mouse is hell
<maxaminusone> I really REALLY want to collaborate with an artist. I suck at drawing but I'm really good at compositing, animation, and effects.
<NightSeas> 12PMMM was interesting XD
<Aurora> 6it's 11
<Aurora> 6and no not yet
<Dman> elision what is that?
<Sol> It looks like a fanfic: Nightfall at Sweet Apple Acres
<Dman> yea i got that much
<Silverscreen> Oi, Sprinkles, what's your favorite movie? I want to put it on the About Us page
<mib_8cjw5n> 0i gotta go see you guys at the movie
<RainBroDash> Dman the only reason I can come out with half-decent stuff like that rainbrodash I've half done is because I just spend aaages making sure it looks ok :P that was done with 60% love, 40% colour picker tool/bucket tool/polygonal lasso tool until it looked ok. Rinse and repeat
<RainBroDash> cya anon :)
<Dman> bie bie mib
<Elision> these are the ones that made me like depressed for a little while
<Silverscreen> 11bye, Anon

<RainBroDash> but I draw like a 7 year old O_O
<Dman> THEN
<Dman> grab a rubber
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well, it's the kind of anime that makes you think of a male zombie in a magical girl outfit as perfectly normal after a while LOL
<Apokalipse> lmao
<Sol> Dman, how long have you been drawing?
<RainBroDash> HAHA spam filter XD
<Sol> D'OH!

<Quanyails> 7Oh, Lyon?
<Dman> use dat rubber
<NightSeas> 12lol XD
*Nittany_Tiger lurks
<Dman> keep going, and eventually you'll draw ponies in no time at all!
<Elision> I'm stil on the "draw shitty ponies" stage
<Elision> keep trying to work pastr it but never managed :(
<RainBroDash> i get you dman. I think I should get a pencil at some point. I'd love to be able to draw
<Dman> sorry for my spam, trying to inspire somepony here
<Dman> absolutely, RainBro
<Apokalipse> the tempera pony I posted was a first try Dman. And I drew it first. Surely you can do something
<Apokalipse> If I can do it anyone ca
<Apokalipse> n
<Sol> Dman, how long have you been drawing?
<Dman> first good drawing took me about 2 hours - two 50 mins in maths doing not much but drawn and 20 mins in biology drawing >_<

*Silverscreen 11is, ironically, getting TF2 now.
<Dman> D: do not want
<Sol> nope.avi
<Dman> silver you're getting it now? yay
<SirSprinkles> 6I'd get TF2, if I could play online... ;-;
<SilverMane> i didn't like TF2, wasn't balanced, didn't feel rewarding, and is dominated by older players
<Axel_Foaley> 3.5 is unwatchable.
<RenegadeBrony> I watched 2 episodes, I barfed because it was so horrible.
<Dman> >wasn't balanced. wat
<RainBroDash> SirSprinkles check your PM :3
<Silverscreen> 11Maximinusone: I watched A Pigs Tale twice, I had enough torture for a few months.
<maxaminusone> lol
<RainBroDash> lol@silverscreen

<maxaminusone> The one that's so bad it's good is Pinkie Pie's Ferris Wheel adventure.

<Aeroslash> hello :>
<Silverscreen> 11I'm loving this.
<Sol> *FiM
<Nittany_Tiger> Trying to watch old MLP? You know that stuff is /only/ aimed at girls and no-one else.
<Dman> glad it is so, silverscreen
<maxaminusone> 3.5 is vapid and shallow. It assumes you haven't learned how to count yet.
<SilverMane> that's funny Silverscreen, because I just picked up McD's
<Silverscreen> 11lol, SilverMane.
<Silverscreen> 11....
<Dman> lol, pyro
<Drake|TF2> 04Quan: No, not really
<Nittany_Tiger> But I haven't tried.
<Drake|TF2> 04Seems fair since no one is ever one anyway
<Silverscreen> 11I want some Scootaloo Nuggets now.
<Drake|TF2> 04on*
<Dman> here we go
<SilverMane> i got me a 10 piece of Scootaloo Mcnuggets
<maxaminusone> I watch it just to see how bad it is.
<Apokalipse> +1 Silverscreen
<Dman> and that sums up one of the scenes we'll be watching tonite, folks
*Hipster_Brony 8will never eat scootaloo nuggets again after watching jamie oliver's food revolution
<Sol> And a Apple Bloom Pie
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Now some non G4 after this

<SirSprinkles> None whatsoever.

<Hipster_Brony> lol
<Silverscreen> 11Am I the only one who absolutly loves that outfit Rarity put on Twilight in the first episode?
<Quanyails> 7Mmm'jay.
<Quanyails> 7kay*
<Quanyails> 7Dah, that's the second time today I've made that typo. D:
<SirSprinkles> 6I thought it was amazing.
<SilverMane> the last one, or one of the earlier ones
*Sol returns brohoof
<Silverscreen> 11The last one.
<Quanyails> 7But anyway, time zones will be a dilemma.
<Dman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFldBVWFgWo
<SilverMane> was pretty nice
<Sol> I thought it looked nice
<Nittany_Tiger> I changed my Steam nick, but it won't change it in Magicka. :/
<Quanyails> 7Seeing it's getting late in the day for people around the Atlantic.
<Quanyails> 7While it's still afternoon-ish for those by the Pacfiic.
<SilverMane> Confound these ponies, they drive me to talk about dresses
<Quanyails> 7Pacific*
<Dman> i like the 6 dresses
<maxaminusone> lol
<Dman> for the gala
<Sol> The chat smile for : / is misleading
<Pattyrick> Wow, reconnecting makes a world of difference
<Hipster_Brony> http://i.imgur.com/Ee8n9.gif
<SilverMane> oh gawd, the gala dresses were gorgeous, especially RD and Fluttershy's
<maxaminusone> I remember watching the dressmaking video and being like "why in the hell am I enjoying this so much?"
<Silverscreen> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEdICVzB4qQ
<Dman> ^ Yes
<Dermathil> ^^
<Ether> art of the dress best song :P
<Hipster_Brony> dammit silver
<SilverMane> art of the dress is my favorite episode. i don't know why. it's not even about my favorite chars
<Sol> I thought the second RD outfit was still badass
<ChaoAqua> 2i'm back to say bye
<Axel_Foaley> Yeah just gorgeous. I almost squeed
<Hipster_Brony> 8winter wrap up is best song
<SirSprinkles> LOL
<ChaoAqua> 2so, uh Osha-Bye allz!
<SilverMane> Neigh, I say neigh!
<insertcupcake> winter wrap up all the way
<Quanyails> 7Bye. o.o
<ChaoAqua> 2gotta go do some chores :P
<Dman> yay silver, your request is gut, ja? : D
<SilverMane> Rarity= best singer, which explains Sweetie Belle
<ChaoAqua> 2don't look at me like that, it's creepy..........
<Silverscreen> 11:D
<Pattyrick> Bye Chao
<Dman> i'm split between Winter Wrap Up, and Art of the Dress, but no other song comes close to these two
<Dermathil> Don't cut the little finger! How do you keep the soap without it?!
<RenegadeBrony> I have sung art of the dress while working on my engine.
<SilverMane> lol
<Silverscreen> 11Which is Ironic since Sweetie's singing voice is Applebloom's VO, but AppleJack's Singing voice is the worst
<Sol> I covered Art of the Dress
<Hipster_Brony> oh, btw, i got skype now
<Elision> lies rarity = worst singer, most vibrato
<Dman> I listened to winterwrapup in my head, while doing my daily 3 mile run. manliness
<Dman> (iPod ofc)
<Sol> and a couple other pony songs >_>
<SirSprinkles> Nice.

<HyperMetalLugia> Use a cellphone?
<Hipster_Brony> 8Silver: you cant type a post that says Princess Celest

<Sol> Mermathil: Ah, thank you
<Creideiki> I personally prefer POTS.
<Pattyrick> we live in Italy, and we don't have to pay for a phone call to th US

<Dermathil> he don't want it to be shown to us

<Silverscreen> 11inb4 Ferris wheel reference.
<Creideiki> (And 180V when it's ringing.)
<HyperMetalLugia> (I was just about to say that too)
<Dman> 'now it's a ghost town'
<Pattyrick> that's for calling to our neighbors, the Navy Base, or God forbid Italian police or firefighters
<SilverMane> a circle of iron ions?
<Hipster_Brony> 8Silvermane: megusta.jpg
<SilverMane> no wait, that's a Ferrous wheel...
<Pattyrick> we just use Magic Jack for when we want to call friends and family back in the US
<Dman> my little ponies, the movie begins in but 10 minutes
<Creideiki> Why would you call a Naval base?
<Creideiki> (Let me guess: "Uh guys, could you shoot missiles in the opposite direction please?")
<Sol> We can't handle Brodyquest. Too many people glancing forever at once. It's break the Space-Time Continuum
<SilverMane> we watched it Friday night though
<Dermathil> then we need PINKIEQUEST
<Pattyrick> we're a Navy family, and there are a lot of things to do on the nearby base
<Apokalipse> sprinkles left
<SilverMane> no! Mentally Advanced Series!
<Dman> uh oh
<GordonFreemane> SPR is an amazing movie. I love it.

<maxaminusone> ok so it wasn't just me
<Tyranico> WB sprinkles
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/meta/src/130817792149.png
<Pattyrick> it's hard to explain to somebody who isn't in the military
<Dman> berg of sprinkles
<SilverMane> lawl @ Sprinkleberg
<Pattyrick> in fact, out here in Italy, it'd probably be a safer bet for me to call the Navy base if there was a fire than to call the Italian fire department
<Lolipop_of_Doom> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnAtBxpihOE

<Dermathil> YES lolipop. Thanks.
<Elision> homemade pasta
<Elision> sogood
<SilverMane> Ok is actually an interesting phrase. It originally was All Correct, was misspelled as Ol Korrect, Shortened to OK, reduced to K, then smartasses started saying Potassium. The next step is to throw bananas at people
<Pattyrick> HML, what I mean is that not everybody we call with Magic Jack has a computer
<Dman> wat
<Creideiki> The original joke was slightly more racy. (Replace "dating" with "sleeping with" for the original. :P )
<Pattyrick> and we don't have much Skype credit

<SilverMane> that is the origin and future of the term OK

<SilverMane> BLASPHEMY
<Dman> it's some basshunter remix I think
<drf|laptop> 03Why would I pay for something that can be done for free?
<Tyranico> lol cocaine
<prince-dari> Hipster_Brony: Agreed.
<RaZor921> Wait... did you say Basshunter?
<HyperMetalLugia> Or for less? XD
<Pattyrick> would I know about something that I've never heard of?
<SilverMane> this is one of the songs that don't belong in English
<Bjornfot> basshunter=swedens biggest faggot
<RaZor921> That makes me hate this song even more
<Dman> i thnk this is a basshunter remix, but not an official one
<HyperMetalLugia> hrm...
<Silverscreen> 11Hipster: Dealwithit.jpg
<maxaminusone1> This is what you get when you mix hallucinogens and stimulants, kids.
<Sol> This the Alina remix
<Pattyrick> I've never even heard of GV before
<Dman> song name : Alina - When You Leave
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe you should check the Internet more often?
<SirSprinkles> Yep.
<Dman> yea sol
<Hipster_Brony> 8Silver: NO U
<RaZor921> I hated this song because it was Romanian, and now it's a fucking Basshunter remix?
<HyperMetalLugia> You might find new things on there :P
<Hipster_Brony> ok, I'll update the FB then
<Sol> It was a Basshunter remix

*SilverMane SilverMane: Lol why can't I hold all these party?
<Dman> silverscreen, how about I love your shit?
<Dermathil> I want to remind everybrony in the room that I swore never ever to take any drug in my life.
<Pattyrick> I've found plenty, it scares me to try to look for more 0__o
<Dman> ...and tolerate : )
<DetectiveBrony> Ahhhh pinkie, second best pony indeed!

<HyperMetalLugia> Well get used to it!
<drf|laptop> 03still
<Sol> Dragosta your boo
<Apokalipse> But ponies is a drug
<drf|laptop> 03all I'm saying is I hate MagicJack, even more than I hate Apple
<Dman> ^
<Elky> you're on a drug, it's called PONIES
<maxaminusone1> Dermathil you broke your promise when you took ponies.
<HyperMetalLugia> Now what about Google+ DRF? :P
<Dman> ^
<Silverscreen> 11Pinkie is a hell of a drug
<SilverMane> I'm on a drug, it's called... dammit Elky, beat me to it
<Dman> ^
<drf|laptop> 03mainly because it's false advertising
<Dermathil> Same could be said for internet.
<Sol> WWwwwwww, translation fail
<Pattyrick> ok, and all I'm saying is that I use it and I'm a satisfied customer
<SilverMane> Pinkie. Not even once
<Dermathil> especially when I can't stop.
<Pattyrick> in what way?
<Elision> is it be movie times?
<RaZor921> I bet no one here knows what Vode An is
<GabeMoist> Silverscreen, I was thinking just that
<SirSprinkles> 6Uno momento while I set up the movie.
<Pattyrick> what is falsely advertised?
<Elision> awesome :D
<SilverMane> Se senor
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm sure both/all products fasely advertise, it's the way of business
<Hipster_Brony> also, do you mind if i plug a charity before we start?
<Dman> offleen?
<DetectiveBrony> I want to watch movie but I want to play tf2....

<Dermathil> MINI MERELL EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Pattyrick> you can, but that doesn't mean you should
<drf|laptop> 03and I would hate to see someone have no phone service except MagicJack, they'd be completely screwed if their house was on fire
<DetectiveBrony> razor, screw sleep, you can sleep when your dead
<Pattyrick> I agree it's not a great idea as a full home phone service
<SilverMane> alright, we need to be yelling battlecries of the Lunar Republic resistance
<Bjornfot> so what's so special with this film anyway
<Elky> also, it's 2 am here, so nothing really makes sense anymore
<Pattyrick> well, they'd be screwed even with regular phone service
<SilverMane> Sleep is for the dead
<Hipster_Brony> alright, im gonna do announcements now then
<Dman> I'm up in 6 bloody hours you gentlemen, I have tea to drink, scones to eat, and a spiffing good show to watch chaps...;__;
<drf|laptop> 03no?
<DetectiveBrony> just a great movie
<RaZor921> Saving Private Ryan is the best war movie ever?
<Pattyrick> what about the phones burning up too?
<SilverMane> it's only 8 pm
<Bjornfot> is it some sort of thingy only americans understand?
<Pattyrick> and the lines?
<drf|laptop> 03because with regular phone service you can call 911
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Elky> sleep is for... sleepy people?
<Pattyrick> and the electricity being cut?
<RaZor921> It's 2AM here...

<Pattyrick> and the phone lines burnt up
<Pattyrick> ok

<Tyranico> Thank you Silverscreen. You did a great job with the site. :)
<HyperMetalLugia> Wow..

<drf|laptop> 03but thank you Apple
<Creideiki> A friend of mine, ended up getting fibre'd up.
<Nittany_Tiger> Pretty new banner by the way.
<Elision> yo I'm really happy for you full metal jacket and Imma let you finish but private ryan had the best war movie of all time. OF ALL TIME.
<HyperMetalLugia> I never knew that
<Dman> @SirSprinkles: YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH
<GabeMoist> I didn't notice the change
<drf|laptop> 03yep
<drf|laptop> 03they're the leading audiobook manufacturer
<HyperMetalLugia> So Apple invented the 'Audio-book' too
<Dman> OF ALL TIME!
<drf|laptop> 03and they've been doing it since casette tapes
<Creideiki> And they owned an ancient phone.
<GabeMoist> I'm blind
<Zanzi> Love the new site
<Elky> I just hope Nick cage isn't in this one.
<SirSprinkles> 6Press play on your streams everypony.

<Dermathil> That's right.
<Pattyrick> rotary phones.... classic
<Silverscreen> 11This...is Pinkie. Pinkie Pie. It is Fun, it is awesome, and kids love her. It's the most addictive kind of Pony, and it can love you. Nopony knows how much of here there is, so everytime she's around, the 4th wall's in danger, but it's so worth it. Look, everypony loves ponies, and Pinkie is one of the best, but there are other and better ones. Remember that.
<HyperMetalLugia> I love it
<GabeMoist> It's to be dramatic
<Dermathil> I forgot that.

<Creideiki> Yeah, it stopped working due to... well the fibre-to-copper converter didn't give enough powah.
<Skylands> 10also, PM?

<RaZor921> The first scene is one of the best action scenes ever
<Creideiki> Oh, he used one of those funky/neat/cool kit things that lets you make Touch Tone tones using a rotary phone.
<Hipster_Brony> 8especially the next scene
<SilverMane> one of those movies where you walk away keenly aware of your own mortality
<Bjornfot> rainbrodash chill :3 i was trying to make a fuckshitstack ref

<Dman> even mw3
<DetectiveBrony> and I still suck at the spelling
<Dman> will use this

<RaZor921> Medal of Honor: Allied Assault pretty much ripped the entire scene off, and so did Company of Heroes
<Silverscreen> 11You puke, I puke, the he pukes.
<Bjornfot> PUKECEPTION
<SilverMane> a lot of the old WWII shooters were amazing, like COD 1 and 2
<Dman> MoH Frontlines was where it was at bro razor

<insertcupcake> just becuase your bones are broken it doesnt mean they wont stop bullets from hitting me
<DetectiveBrony> so um...hold on it might take me a while but I might be able to talk to you in a highly butchered version of your language lol
<HyperMetalLugia> DSL is still the best *shot*
<Elision> steam froze for me :|
<SilverMane> MAG is alright, Socom was never my flavor
<Creideiki> A guy I know (helped me get some expansion stuff for my PDP-11) has an old AUTOVON phone.
<Armada_Ofdeath> get to the top your bubbleas are runing out
<SilverMane> lol
<Creideiki> It's pretty neat. Though incredibly ugly and large.
<Dermathil> COD2 had a level about normandy. it was frickin amazing.
<Dman> germans: dayum painkillah
<DetectiveBrony> Tu aimes cette film?
<RaZor921> Bjornfot: Try ArmA II
<Bjornfot> i'm not the FPS-type of person, i prefer strategy over action... hence MAG
<Armada_Ofdeath> dont worry he will just respawn
<RaZor921> That's some hardcore shit
<BoomBoom> ikr cod 2s d day finale was intense

<charmin> zat is correct, madamo
<SilverMane> important things to notice, the fact that the entire beach became stained red
<BoomBoom> but im tired of cod now they dont really innovate so i got bored with them
<Creideiki> (IT;s also a four line phone. Which he doesn't really need as he only has one phone line... and the extra keys do nothing really useful.)
<BronyWithACrowbar> @Sol: It gets more violent as the movie progresses.
<insertcupcake> ^
<Nittany_Tiger> Old CoD > new CoD past 4.

<Dermathil> hopefully I will get ideas for my fanfic from watching this movie.
<Soarin> this is how coding worked in WW2

<RaZor921> Someone needs to make "Sir" an official meme
<SilverMane> it actually is Sol

<SilverMane> YES
<Dman> Samurai AppleJack
<Dermathil> Dman: maybe something like the current scene?
<GabeMoist> Do eet
<R-Zack> Dman, XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8but that would have ponies dying in it...
<Hipster_Brony> 8DO NOT WANT
<SilverMane> no, Saving Private Rarity fits better in the name sake
<RainBroDash> MFW JUST REALISED HE HAS 1 ARM
<Soarin> someone recreate THE WHOLE MOVIE with ponies
<Dman> i guess dermathil
<Sol> We have enough Grimdark ponyfics ;_;
<Dermathil> Pinkamina: that means Applebloom and Big Macintosh died!?!??
<Dman> moar
<BronyWithACrowbar> Gilda can be the sniper that got killed through the scope.

<TGPFluttershy> Sol, awww....but I was planning another one :(
<Dman> what if season 2 attracts more new bronies...HOW MORE FANFICS POSSIBRU?
<R-Zack> Hipster_Brony, I don't mind. It means these brave ponies fight hard to keep their land safe, besides, outside of equestria isn't 100% happy or crime free.

*Elision rereads the night that never ended

<Hipster_Brony> 8i HATE grimdark, thats just my opinion
<Pinkamina> well, same here
<SilverMane> exposition = plot
<R-Zack> As long there is a peaceful ending to it.
<Elky> dat honest, hardworking american woman
<RainBroDash> I dislike grimdark :/ I don't find it that entertaining
<Elky> ugh
<Pinkamina> Fuck grimdark. I watch Ponies to ESCAPE from my agoniuzing depression
<Pinkamina> *agonizing
<TheMostSlyFox> ^
<charmin> i still read cupcakes
<Silverscreen> 11Pinkimina: Dito.
<Elision> it depends on my moon
<Bjornfot> >says freakin Pinkamina
<SilverMane> Grimdark and Sad hit me the hardest, Shipping makes me sad, random makes me insane
<Elision> mood*
<SirSprinkles> 6I laugh at the ponies that think Grimdark belongs in the culture. It's just... no.
<GabeMoist> At the moment I don't think ponies mix with Grimdark
<Dermathil> Hipster: Grimdark stories that are grimdark to be grimdark are bad. Grimdark stories that are grimdark as an aftereffect of the main story are good.
<Apokalipse> I like grimdark
<R-Zack> Meh, I don't really like grimdark, i'll go as far as war though.
<Elky> I like grimdark, it can be pretty fun
<RaZor921> I watch Ponies so I can walk around all day smiling
<Dermathil> Mindless grimdark is bad.
<Apokalipse> What Dermathil said
<insertcupcake> ^
<Elision> I also like to feel really sad sometimes
<BronyWithACrowbar> Bubbles was freakin' sad, bro.
<Hipster_Brony> 8dermathil: i disagree
<TheMostSlyFox> :'(
<Pinkamina> FYI my username is PINKAMINA not PINKAMENA
<Pinkamina> There is a difference
<Dman> I E
<RaZor921> RAMIREZ, KILL CHUCK NORRIS WITH YOUR FACE!
<Dman> ...sir
<Pikaru> Oh jeez. I can't believe I forgot there was a stream today. AGAIN. D:
<Elky> so it's like, 'Pinkie is mine'?
<Soarin> you guys make it sound like grimdark has to be something bad, just take the Fallout pony crossover, 2 awesome things combined
<SilverMane> ponies make me cry sometimes. Today, Tomorrow, Forever. Teacher and Student.
<Pinkamina> No
<Tyranico> manly tears
<Dermathil> Hipster: I understand why you do, and that's why I respect your opinion.
<Pinkamina> Pinkie + Kamina
<Bjornfot> for every grimdark there's 10 shipping fics
<SilverMane> NOOOO
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont like any stories with ponies that involve death, dying, maiming etc...
<Pinkamina> As in the badass dude from Gurren Lagann
<Dman> I haven't cried for about 5years. feelsbadpony.jpg
<Sol> When you read a story about Equestria was a fictional place made up by ponies in delusion, and how ponies like Applejack are really starved to the point of malnutrition, yo begin to hate grimdark
<Hipster_Brony> 8i watch ponies to escape from that
<Bjornfot> HOLY MANURE PINKAMINA
<SilverMane> My Little Muffin, part one, is sad as hell
<eat911> Ponies dyin makes me sad
<R-Zack> ....
<eat911> dying*
<Dermathil> I understand that, Hipster.
<RaZor921> I don't read fanfics at all. I read some of the comics, but I never read fanfics
<Apokalipse> I'm just in it for a good story. And grimdark can provide a good story
<Dermathil> And that's why I respect that.
<R-Zack> I read cupcakes, I felt fine after..
<Pikaru> This movie made me cry and teach me to be a patriot to America. Thing is, I'm Canadian.
<Tyranico> same here razor
<Elision> cupcakes is just derp
<SilverMane> cupcakes hurt, but it made me stronger
<Hipster_Brony> 8same razor, its been over a month since i have read any fanfics
<Bjornfot> cupcakes is hilarious
<SirSprinkles> 6We don't talk about Cupcakes here.
<Elision> it's not really grimdark just dumb and gory
<prince-dari> I think cupcakes was intended to be funny.
<R-Zack> Pikaru, heh,cool. :)
<Dermathil> GUYS, CUPCAKES IS PERMBANNED FROM THIS CHAT. REMEMBER THAT.
<RaZor921> Well I haven't read any fanfic at all
<Hipster_Brony> 8guys, no Cupcakes discussion
<Hipster_Brony> 8it causes too much drama
<SilverMane> how about the Luna games
*RainBroDash is going to make OC pony reaction images, even though he doesn't post on ponychan, or anywhere that requires it.
<Elky> suddenly, no chat?
<Sol> How about that Bubbles
<Silverscreen> 11Grimdark is only to be involved in universes that fit them best. And Grimdark fics are best when focused on psychology.
<Elision> bubbles also didn't make me that sad
<SilverMane> Buttercup is better
<Hipster_Brony> 8RainBro, why don't you post on Ponychan?
<charmin> apple bloom game ftw
<SilverMane> wait, is Bubbles a fanfic?
<RaZor921> I've never been to Ponychan, or 4chan
<BronyWithACrowbar> Yes.
<Elision> today tomorrow and forever? yes. a summer twilight? YES
<SilverMane> the one on Newgrounds, Charmin?
<Elision> bubbles? eh
<Bjornfot> bubbles is awesome
<Dermathil> Pony Rain has a psychological twist that makes it good. Same for Pony Psychology.

<SirSprinkles> 6eat911, no Cupcakes discussion here.
<RainBroDash> @Hipster_Brony I just don't really engage that well with the majority of the posters. I like the scene but I just don't find it that enjoyable for some reason. I don't really understand it myself
<BronyWithACrowbar> Bubbles is awesome and sad. Happ sad, that is.
<Pinkamina> "sweet Apple Massacre" is the most horrifying fanfic. I'm actually thinking of taking the author of that one to court. Or something. Whatever will land him in prison for obscenity.
<BronyWithACrowbar> *Happy
<Elky> really?
<Hipster_Brony> 8WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT CUPCAKES DISCUSSION
<Dman> umm...

<TGPFluttershy> Dermathil, oh tell me about it...Started a brony group in this website I go to. Nothing but hate
<BronyWithACrowbar> The Fanfic That Should Not Be Named.
<maxaminusone1> the fic that shall not be named?
<Elision> oh
<GabeMoist> SPOILERS: Ryan started the fire
<R-Zack> Anyone read that offical comic on Equestria Daily?
<SilverMane> oh, it ruined Pinkie for you
<Silverscreen> 11ah.
<TheMostSlyFox> Yes
<Sol> I saw it
<Bjornfot> yes r-zack it's horrible
<R-Zack> XD
<R-Zack> Ikr.
<charmin> TFTSNBN????
<Dermathil> Whu, TGPFluttershy?
<R-Zack> Yesterday
<Elision> I love shopping!
<Elky> what comic?
<Elky> oh, this one
<Hipster_Brony> 8that comic was... horrifying
<TheMostSlyFox> Applejack doesnt even have her hat... HASBRO I am dissapoint...
<SilverMane> what comic
<Elky> love the deformed ponies
<Elky> they're fun
<SilverMane> oh, that 4 page official comic?
<GabeMoist> Dose vectors
<Hipster_Brony> 8twilight's face is all messed up
<Bjornfot> that comic should be banned from here as well
<R-Zack> When they make rarity said "I love shopping!", I wanted to punch my screen.
<charmin> hasbro comics are the best
<SilverMane> mmm, ground tomatoes
<RaZor921> The Time Off comic is the best
<Sol> At least her arm is in the right place, unlike the Bridlemaids poster ><
<insertcupcake> the best kind
<GabeMoist> FOOD FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT
<RenegadeBrony> Tomacco, fuel of war.
<Elky> I like those, it's like they're parodying themselves
<TGPFluttershy> Dermathil, A gaming website I go to. Started a group there called "Brony alliance" and EVERYONE's hating
<R-Zack> They were made from some comic makers, hopefully, they don't influence the show too much.
<Tyranico> Funny how fans can create better comics than people getting paid to do the same
<Dermathil> Sol, that's a leg, not an arm. Ponies ain't got arm.
<TGPFluttershy> Those vectors...ughhh..
<SilverMane> indeed
<Hipster_Brony> 8paul giamatti is a pretty chill bro
<Dermathil> What's the website, The Great and Powerful Fluttershy?
<R-Zack> Tyranico, we don't have pressure.
<charmin> defromed ponies are my fav
<TGPFluttershy> Screwattack.com
<Silverscreen> 11Brony Alliance should be the name of a TF2 group.
<Sol> >Human Poses >Translate leg as arm >D'oh
<SilverMane> this is the most creative fandom (neigh, Subculture) I've ever seen
<Dermathil> ah
<RainBroDash> @Hipster_Brony, random question: what's ponychan's usual reception of people who post reaction images using OC ponies?
<RaZor921> Fuck Screwattack, I stopped going there 2 years ago
<TGPFluttershy> First post is called "My little bronies" if you're interested.
<Hipster_Brony> 8RainBro: fine, as long as they aren't sues
<TGPFluttershy> It's a good community.
<Elky> the only thing that saves the horrible plot of those comics is the weird art, you should be glad
<Dermathil> Never been there, TGPF.
<SirSprinkles> 6What Hipster said.
<R-Zack> When I saw the human poses, the first thing I thought of is transforming hands/gloves that turn into human hands.. O.o
<Elky> fine, as long as they aren't ember
<Hipster_Brony> 8Ember Storm is really the only one that gets hate
<Silverscreen> 11RainBroDash: The majority of Ponychan is fine with OCs so long as they aren't Mary Sues.
<Psiclop> Sonichu...
<TGPFluttershy> It helps me maintain my gamer side.
<charmin> lol
<Elision> ember storm?
<Silverscreen> 11Which is really unwarranted nowadays.
<SirSprinkles> 6Ember Storm is an alicorn.
<SirSprinkles> 6>>;
<Hipster_Brony> 8Ember Storm is an alicorn OC
<Bjornfot> aw gawd
<Elision> oh my god
<Elky> I think the ember thing is just for fun nowadays
<SilverMane> OC Alicorns are bad, mmmkay?
<Elision> ugh
<Sol> Alicorns in general usually -> bad rap
<TGPFluttershy> OCs aren't all that bad.
<R-Zack> OC pegasi
<Elky> an alicorn pyromancer with a crush on twilight
<R-Zack> :D
<Hipster_Brony> 8people hate on him ALL the time, its very un-brony liek
<Hipster_Brony> 8like*
<SilverMane> !!!
<charmin> yes i hate oc alicorns
<GabeMoist> I will make a Super Mary Sue OC
<RainBroDash> @Silverscreen/Hipster_Brony ok, so say if I did decide to post on ponychan and I used expression variants of my OC (it just fits my name is all) then that wouldn't get insta-ignored or OMGWTFBBQ GO AWAY LOL U FREAK
<Hipster_Brony> 8you will get welcomed
<Silverscreen> 11Nope
<Silverscreen> 11You'd be welcomed as a brony.
<Dermathil> THIS SCENE
<TGPFluttershy> Ponychan is awesome
<Elky> I prefer normal reaction images personally, but go ahead
<SilverMane> this is a crazy scene
<TheMostSlyFox> DAT FRENCH BAIT
<Hipster_Brony> 8post an "im new here" thread on /oat/ and you will get lots of welcomes and hugs
*Silverscreen 11uses OC Reaction images for RP only.
<Dermathil> EVERYBODY, SHUT UP AND WATCH PLZ
<GabeMoist> And I will make fanfics for my SUper Mary Sue Deluxe OC
<RainBroDash> Fair enough. I'd not post it unless it looked decent enough anyway. Some OC ponies just look... oh dear...
<Tyranico> TGPFluttershy: Eeyup
<Bjornfot> i say, screw the haters
<R-Zack> DAT SACRIFICE...sir.
<Dermathil> SECOND BEST SCENE IN MOVIE
<Pikaru> This scene was heart wrenching.
<charmin> lol take my child
<RainBroDash> Like the ones with bright greens, or full-black OC ponies. bleugh.
<charmin> teach her how to fight
<RaZor921> Take my kid, she's going to be much safer in the fighting
<RenegadeBrony> I'm nervous at posting and joining stuff, got a bit of an aversion with a not being accepted complex.
<Hipster_Brony> 8Vin Diesel dun goof'd
<RaZor921> Same as RenegadeBrony
<TGPFluttershy> Ponychan is very accepting
<R-Zack> They yell too much
<SilverMane> holy crap it IS vin diesel
<TheMostSlyFox> BAM
<Pikaru> Oh God. :<
<RaZor921> Well no shit Silvermane
<Pikaru> It begins.
<Elky> most OC ponies are pretty obivous, they don't fit in with the show
<RaZor921> And now he's dead
<charmin> damn you fucking pedo, give me that girl
<Dermathil> SNIPER
<SilverMane> i never noticed
<Pikaru> Oh no. He's not dead. At least not yet.
<TheMostSlyFox> Dumb frenchies
<TGPFluttershy> I always find it hilarious how almost NO other subculture is accepting of bronies, considering that they may be subculture by themselves.
<Sol> MEDIC
<RaZor921> Not yet, but soon to be, and that means that the war is lost
<Pikaru> You get to see him bleed out in the rain. Suffering.
<TheMostSlyFox> THAT: was doctor assisted homicide
<BronyWithACrowbar> Dat choppy rain sound.
<Bjornfot> Furry Fandom is, TGPFluttershy
<Elision> I think it's because they tend to come off as cultists
<RaZor921> I've seen the movie 10 times, I know what happens
<SilverMane> you know, I see a lot of furry haters inside the Brony subculture, which is hippocrtical
<Hipster_Brony> 8Pikaru, stop with the spoilers
<Dermathil> MOMMY COME GET ME!!!
<R-Zack> TGPFluttershy, maybe they are just jealous of how powerful we really are together. THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP!
<Pikaru> Oh, sorry.
<Dermathil> little girl:
<RenegadeBrony> It took me like 4 full brony movie nights to start saying stuff an actually settle on a name.

<RaZor921> Which was 2 weeks ago
<Light_Latias> 12kay D:
<insertcupcake> furry and bronies are not mutualy exclusive
<Elky> well, it's mostly because some bronies decide to be pretty aggressive in their showing their obsession
<TGPFluttershy> But otakus, gamers and others? Nooo...
