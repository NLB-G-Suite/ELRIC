And I have been snacking on blue fungi, but that's none of your concern.

<SirGanjalf> That cock needs more focus in his focus
<PONY> Violent Cock porn
<RainbowAsh> No animals were harmed during the making of this movie my ass.
<Kencolt> To me? Boring, really.
<Alchemist> I think this whole movie was just an excuse for a bunch of guys to visit exotic places and... indulge in certain activities. If you know what I mean.
<Om> GilDash: Oh no.
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: hey, you have 2 hidden comments on your account...
<Naetaru> Alchemist: No please, elaborate...
<FlareChaser> what was it? :3
<PONY> RainbowAsh: Nobody cared at the time when this film was cared
<DocSane> On the other hand, this is Marcos's Phillipines, so anything goes.
<alexxm> why can't this movie end

<Deadlypon3> ...Aaand animal rights kill themselves

<Deadlypon3> Oh, Okay
<Darf14> A bomb..... he is now a terrorist
<Kandarihuski> All of a sudden, it's buffering
<RainbowAsh> PONY: I think they still filmed in black and white when animal protection became industry standard. At least the footage from that poor horse they dropped off a 50 foot cliff is in black and white, and that triggered the whole protection thing.
<Saigneur> oh just my bass canon !!!!!!
<DocSane> Why is it buffering?
<Saigneur> WYUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUB
<Saigneur> DocSane: you too ? i'm not alone anymore
<Twilight_Sparkle^_^> everyday im buffering
<HyperMetalLugia> At least my two year old PC has good performance :|
<SirGanjalf> actually more than 2 min., because of buffer
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: want to be a part of the fukireta parade? it will be fun
<alexxm> RainbowAsh what
*Saigneur shuffle

<Naetaru> DAt buffering E:
<Kencolt> There does seem to be rather a lot of buffering going on.
<DocSane> I fixed it with a refresh
<Deadlypon3> They still run under him!/
<Darf14> Needs more buffering
<Kandarihuski> I don't usually buffer. But when I do, it's not on my end.
<drfsupercenter> 03well

<PONY> whatch as everyone that need to be killed gets a gun, so they can be counted as enemies.
<RainbowAsh> alexxm, the nostalgia chick talked about it in her Milo and Otis review. I wouldn't recommend watching that one if you have a squeazy stomach, though, because that is another movie that didn't take animal protection seriously at all.
<HyperMetalLugia> Shame the site doesn't have OSX torrents

<Samurott> The thing about SSH logs, save those so that you can downgrade just in case you want to go back to 4
<Darf14> Clelstia had a lot of will to not send RD to the moon for when she assaulted her with a cloud
<panda> CrimsonPhoenix: the H should be a M right?
<Biglaw> ahem, the idiots are here
<drfsupercenter> 03it's SHSH
<Kandarihu> I notice that most of the pegasi have their wings out by default.
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah
<DocSane> Duck face
<Samurott> iFaith is the tool you'll ned for that
<Pale_Horse> I know pegasus magic lets them walk on clouds. I can roll with that... but what keeps the clouds of Cloudsdale in the shape of a city without slowly breaking up and drifiting away in the wind? Unless there are "Pegasi sculptors" constantly reshaping it all the time. :/
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh

<Samurott> You had it when?
<Svettponny> "I am basically a God, and I think RD is the best flier in all of Equestria. My word is law, but she's still not a given member of the Wonderbolts."
<Meanwhile> Thanks for streaming SuperBrony64.
<alexxm> what for Gamer_Luna
<FlareChaser> SuperBrony64: wat
<Pale_Horse> Touche.

<Darf14> Yay games :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My stream is super-behind.
<RainbowAsh> Pale_Horse, the weather is controlled by pegasi. Wind is a part of weather.
<Somebronyyayz> "plans" if u know what i mean

<Meanwhile> Still shipped with Spitfire.
<Samurott> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<alexxm> whats it about Gamer_Luna
<Kandarihu> They're normal clouds. I think that the way the pegasi keep their wings out is how they can stand on clouds without falling through them.

<Soital> 12dunno what version I had
<CrimsonPhoenix> Fun fact, it took RD 20 seconds to make that Sonic Rainboom
<Samurott> I wonder if anybody would hate me for getting a Gmail account
<GilDash> Airpuff: I'm not finding the clip for you, because I might not come back. :p

<Bronysith> SuperBrony64: no i mean are you going to be part of the vid
<drfsupercenter> 03I prefer Yahoo but nothing against gmail
<BlueFlare> 02besides, you can't be a youtube member unless you have gmail
<Samurott> Just making sure

<Soital> 12I may just try this...
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Shadowabsol> 14I like Yahoo! better too, but BlueFlare is right. Gmail is almost a requirement for YouTube nowadays.
<Samurott> because I know a few people at school where complain about the threading and notifications and I was wondering if it has your seal of approval
<Soital> 12who knows it might work!

<Princess_Molestia> Irish, what do you want?
<Gamer_Luna> Princess_Molestia Hello,Sister! :)
<Tov|GoodLoser> For a minute there, I was afraid Rayman Origins would stream here.
<panda> Wrek: not sausy enough ^^
<Samurott> well, they can't do much more, but you can do more with them
<Shadowabsol> 14I never saw the point in jailbreaking my iPod touch...
<Litwick> play through them in order?
<Airpuff> Spitfire: .. so.. much.. spitfire..
<Princess_Molestia> Ah, luna!
<owlicious> PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
<Irish_Pony> Princess_Molestia: You havent awnsered me....

<panda> SuperBrony64: I LOVE YOU!
<Darf14> So close to 100%
<nekohime> owlicious: I'm not really new, I just haven't been around much the last couple months
<SuperBrony64> 11,02o////o
<Samurott> Customization, software changes, adding free applications, etc.
<Shadowabsol> 14A lot of people said that I should, but I was never sold on the idea.
<GilDash> Alchemist: Stop. Reminding. Me. :D
<Gamer_Luna> Princess_Molestia Sister,what are you doing here?
<Litwick> Guys, quiet. I have a message for SuperBrony64.
<Naetaru> My countrys pride and joy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXySHddZNRk

<drfsupercenter> 03supposedly
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
<Princess_Molestia> Irish, I said this before, you insulted my talents, unless you apolagize i will ignore you!
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i gotta wait till july 6th to get this game -.-
<panda> SuperBrony64: I WANNA BE YOUR SPECIAL SOMEPONY!
<panda> XD
<Shadowabsol> 14Why would you want to do that, though?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> thats when its released in EU
<Litwick> So, yes or no?
<drfsupercenter> 03because iOS is awful
<Shizuka> 13torchlight 2 needs to hurry up and release
*SuperBrony64 hugs panda and Litwick :3
<Irish_Pony> Princess_Molestia: Since when did I say that?!
<BlueFlare> 02FTW Android
<BlueFlare> 02that's why
*BlueFlare runs
<Shadowabsol> 14I like Droid and everything, but they're really not that much better.
<owlicious> SuperBrony64: get plan 10 perfectly so you're done with this game
<Princess_Molestia> Yesterday
<drfsupercenter> 03yes they are LOL
<Litwick> IS FUNNY CUZ I'M A GUTY
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I haven't even played the first Torchlight.
<Litwick> *GUY
<BlueFlare> 02oh they are
<panda> Litwick: so am I ^^ and so is SuperBrony64
<drfsupercenter> 03granted BlueFlare is probably the closest I've seen to an Android fanboy if that can actually exist
<Shadowabsol> 14Sorry, but I've had nothing but a bad experience with them so far.
*panda hugs SuperBrony64 back
<drfsupercenter> 03I have other stuff too like HP TouchPad and so on
<junh1024-XD> kekeke
<SuperBrony64> 11,02owlicious: You don't want me to play this game anymore? :<
<drfsupercenter> 03Shadowabsol you remind me of my friend -_-
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SB is one P away from total perfection.
<drfsupercenter> 03He bought an Android phone
<drfsupercenter> 03tha twas defective
<Iwa> PLay a remix level :D
<Irish_Pony> Princess_Molestia: That was before I knew...your real talents....
<drfsupercenter> 03went "Man, Android doesn't work, I'm buying an iPhone"
<VioletGreySha> Shizuka: i know what you mean ._.
<MyLittleDashie> hi guys
<Princess_Molestia> Oh?
<Shadowabsol> 14I would never buy an iPhone.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like seriously? Just for ONE bad experience? Nothing is perfect, defects happen
<owlicious> SuperBrony64: well, i've changed countries since you've started. it'
<drfsupercenter> 03THANK YOU
<FlareChaser> Sorry guys, chat derped.
<owlicious> s been a while
<drfsupercenter> 03FInally someone with common sense
<Darf14> Final stage :O
<LordDerpington> Hey MyLittleDashie
<drfsupercenter> 03but how is an iPod Touch any different
<Litwick> you can't do it
<Princess_Molestia> *rubs gamer Luna's horn*
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just an iPhone without the phone.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01doubles the SuperBrony64
<FlareChaser> Muffin0: whats the email?
<Litwick> You can do it SuperBronywubby
<BlueFlare> 02true
<Irish_Pony> Princess_Molestia: Ok im sorry! I really am sorry!
<FlareChaser> DONG DONG
<alexxm> best date ever
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fart rocket.
<Ran> 2If it can phone people and text people, I don't care what type of phone it is
<Gamer_Luna> Princess_Molestia W-what are you doing,sis?
<Saigneur> this game must be HARD
<Shadowabsol> 14I don't use my iPod touch to communicate with people. I use it for my own personal entertainment. I noticed that you're not a huge fan of the touchscreen, but I like the idea a lot.
<Princess_Molestia> I forgive you Irish
<LordDerpington> Man, I love rhythm games.
<drfsupercenter> 03Android is touchscreen too, Shadowabsol
<Litwick> Jeff
<Yankee> jeff
<Marx> Come on...
<Darf14> It looks freakin hard :O
<drfsupercenter> 03the thing I hate about iPod Touch/iPhone is that there's only one giant button
<Shadowabsol> 14I know, I've owned and played with quite a few Android items.
<alexxm> hey Princess_Molestia hows your day been
<drfsupercenter> 03Android at least gives you the menu/back buttons
<Espeon> 06Ran4president
<junh1024-XD> well
<nekohime> wait a minute, is this what that video of pinkie pie eating cupcakes in rythim is supposed to be about?
<junh1024-XD> 4?
<Espeon> 065ever
<junh1024-XD> power, home, V+ V-
<Yukari> how did I join during one of these again
<Shadowabsol> 14The back buttons are normally on the touchscreen.
<Ran> 2:D
<Princess_Molestia> Good i guess
<Irish_Pony> Princess_Molestia: Then...can you help me? Im a bit lonley....
<drfsupercenter> 03Apple's logic is "Remove all buttons!"
<drfsupercenter> 03hence the Macbook Wheel
<Saigneur> rarity ????
*drfsupercenter runs
<Naetaru> This is just... So... Random as fuck...
<LordDerpington> Yep, nekohime . There's one of Rarity playing golf, Twilight DJing too.
<Princess_Molestia> Sure Irish
*alexxm hugs Irish_Pony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Almost.
<BlueFlare> 02it really is
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<panda> .... missed one?
<Shadowabsol> 14That's not true. They actually added buttons onto the iPod touch since its very first version.
<Marx> Awwwwww.
<nekohime> LordDerpington: are those just videos or are they actually playable?
<Litwick> NOOOOOO
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<drfsupercenter> 03but not nearly enough
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aww.
<Kandarihu> Aw
<Darf14> DANG! SO CLOSE!! >_<
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01At the lame game as well.
<Marx> Dangit.
<Biglaw> awww

<ScriptBot> Ran, you are a Makuhita.
<Ran> 2!eonget
<ScriptBot> 4Ran just got a shiny female 6Espeon
<Ran> 2<3
<drfsupercenter> 03Android has power button too, plus volume, as well as home/search/back/menu
<Ran> 2But Staraptor :<
<drfsupercenter> 03some of the newer ones got rid of the search button but that's useless anyway
<Gamer_Luna> What Game is this?Looks fun :)
<FlareChaser> SuperBrony64: DISTRACTION
<LordDerpington> nekohime: Just videos, unfortunately. There is one which has Pinkie and Twilight batting books back and forth which is a sprite swap of one of the levels in this game though.
<nickstr_android> True
<Naetaru> This game... I must play... While drunk...
<Michael> Gnight everypony
<alexxm> bye Michael
<nekohime> darn, I would love to play that
<FlareChaser> Naetaru: been there, done that.
<Naetaru> FlareChaser: And how'd that go? xP
<Litwick> You okay SuperBrony64 Wubbykins?
<FlareChaser> Naetaru: another reason I quit drinking :3
<Darf14> SO close but yet so Far
<Litwick> ((At this point, I'm just fucking with him.))
<nickstr_android> They did get rid of it on some
<Shadowabsol> 14Look, I'm not saying that I dislike Android. I actually claimed the exact opposite of that, but I just don't think that you should tamper with a product of a different franchise just so you can put something else completely different on it that you could have just gone out and bought from the franchise you wanted in the first place.
<Naetaru> FlareChaser: That means I shouldn't play it while drunk? o.o'
<FlareChaser> Naetaru: means you should :3
<HyperMetalLugia> uh wait
<HyperMetalLugia> what
<Shadowabsol> 14e.g. putting Android on an iPod touch
<Litwick> DO IT!
<HyperMetalLugia> At least it has flash
*HyperMetalLugia flee
*Nittany_Discord 11,01does it.
<drfsupercenter> 03I get what you're saying
<Naetaru> FlareChaser: ... *glare* >:T
<alexxm> hey Princess_Molestia hows your day been
*RainbowcrashNBurn does something
<Litwick> How about this. If he wins I'll do a proposal to him LIVE at the next comic-con.
<Espeon> 06wait people actually buy iPods and install android on them
<drfsupercenter> 03again, I only got an iPod Touch because I *had* to in order to rip Jammit tracks
<HyperMetalLugia> I know one other operating system that doesn't have good flash
*Nittany_Discord 11,01explodes
<Wood_stuck_to_a_pole> rhythm game! what is it?
<WindWhistler> How long has SB been playing!?
<nickstr_android> iOS will never have Flash
<Princess_Molestia> im in the middle of something!
<drfsupercenter> 03and now I don't want it anymore

<HyperMetalLugia> You guys need to wait 5 years
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<FlareChaser> DONG DONG
<alexxm> how much practice does this game take
<WindWhistler> ........
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually will start liking Apple products if they make something different
<WindWhistler> I meant today
<HyperMetalLugia> until steve's product ghost runs out of idea
<Samurott> I have a feeling that the new iPad was still a Steve-era product
<drfsupercenter> 03e.g. NOT STARTING WITH A LOWERCASE I
<WindWhistler> How long has he been streaming?
<Wood_stuck_to_a_pole> oh yeah it is i saw it by wiiviewr a while ago

<dderpy> Black Hole EvaporationJust now we have seen that a black hole "shines" with Hawking radiation. The escaping member of a virtual particle pair carried away energy from the black hole, and the black hole loses mass as a result.

<dderpy> his Energy should be equal to the energy a black hole puts into a pair of virtual photons. So let's bring the formulas together.Now we can substitute all of the constants and we got:Looks great! If we put in a mass in kilograms we'll get a temperature in Kelvin.

<Saturn> 08,01CupcakeWarrior: since the 70s, i believe
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I love CoD, sure it might not be an original game, but sometimes it's a matter of content being different than just the actual gameplay that makes things cool...or at least it's just with CoD ><
<Shizuka> 13protocol was finalized in 1983 i think
<CupcakeWarrior> Shizuka: I meant the protocol
<Shizuka> 13i'd have to double check

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Kipkat07_Mare: Well, that's not really an appropriate topic to discuss publically in chat, but I wouldn't be the best person to talk about that anyway.
