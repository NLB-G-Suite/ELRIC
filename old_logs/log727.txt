<Michael|sad> CriticKitten: kids are cruel
<Michael|sad> CriticKitten: sometimes
<VenHur> I feel your pain, bro.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Larrys/Jetpack Comics Shared Version for Issue #2
<Sick_icybeauti> don't get me wrong, being a teacher is an extremely hard job. I sometiems see that my teachers sometimes want to rage quit on my classes soemtimes.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> well it also depends where you teach
<Sick_icybeauti> ^^
<Kammerjunk> I have to say, I've gotten to one of the better schools. At least half the people here are actually dedicated to making an effort.
<Vivix> That's the good thing the higher you get in the system
<CriticKitten> My school's the bottom of the barrel. :D
<Vivix> more people are there by choice rather than "Just cuz"
<CriticKitten> And it shows.
<Vordox> Wait..
<Sick_icybeauti> My teachers are actually good this eyar though, but in middle school, I had some pretty bad teachers.
<Vivix> Have you seen blackboard Jungle? That movie made me hurt inside- poor teachers
<Vordox> Doom 3 was AFTER Quake 4?
<VenHur> Dat Russian accent.
<shizumobile> Like doom 3, the engine is fantastic as long as you don't look too close
<shizumobile> Doom 3 was first silly
<Sick_icybeauti> CriticKitten: Are you teaching somewhere that's middle class?
<CriticKitten> No.
<Vordox> Shizuka: Really? It feels like Doom 3 was released around 2008 or so
<CriticKitten> South Bend.
<CriticKitten> It's a hellhole.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> my high school was BS, it was work for the sake of work, and there was insane amounts of it. college is so much easier
<Sick_icybeauti> CriticKitten: Ouch. I heard about how bad the schools can be there.
<Barb|AtWork> Oh nice. Quack FO'
<Vivix> I think doom3 was 200..6-7?
<CriticKitten> I basically took this job because "it's a job" originally, because I too believed in the logic of "any job > no job". But that was before this place.
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: 2005.
<CriticKitten> Now I've changed my mind.
<Vivix> woah really?
<Vordox> Vivix: Time...
<Vordox> Sucks
<Vivix> it flies like a bitch-
<Vivix> with wings
<Invi> CriticKitten, can you switch the school?
<Time> :3
<Vordox> EPIC QUAKE MUSIC GO
<VenHur> Guys, Doom 3 was released a year earlier before Quake 4.
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: Silly filly, dogs don't have wings.
<CriticKitten> Invi: No. The whole district is this bad.
<Vivix> stop trolling me Time ;__;
<Vivix> hehe
<Vordox> VenHur: 2004? O.o
<VenHur> Vordox: Correct.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> im hoping to teach calc 1-2 or earlier at some point
<SpeedyBolt> Bangbangbangbang
<Vordox> Hooooly crap that's old
<CriticKitten> Our school is only "good" in the district because we rarely have violence against our teachers. But that's about all I can say.
<Vivix> wow-
<Sick_icybeauti> Hard stuff man.
<CriticKitten> Some of our teachers have been assaulted or threatened with weapons or whatnot
<Vivix> now I feel old
<CriticKitten> So yeah.
<CriticKitten> :D
<twoiloight_spurnkle> yay gun laws
<Casey1859> Hello. So what are we watching?
<Vordox> shizumobile: Speaking about FPS; you tried out the game I gave you yet? =3
<Michael|sad> pfff
<Sick_icybeauti> I'm in snooty land, so we don't see that. But the kids act like spoiled brats though.
<VenHur> What I wants for a video game of my own is an indie game I had in mind.
<Vordox> Sick_icybeauti: they don't act, they are.
<Michael|sad> ohai Casey1859
<Vordox> VenHur: I'm listening...
<Vivix> spoiling a child does exactly what it says on the tin
<Sick_icybeauti> Vordox: Duh....I met a few that don't act liek snoots though.
<Barb|AtWork> Sargent Shizu takes on the strogg army, single handedly
<CriticKitten> In a related story, I sympathize wholeheartedly with the Republican platform of "enough babying the kids, hold them to standards and pick winners/losers instead of everybody-wins-mentality".
<Vordox> Sick_icybeauti: Take good care of them... Of course without favouriticing them
<CriticKitten> Because this school is a prime proof of what happens when there is no standard and everybody wins.
<CriticKitten> There's zero discipline and everybody fails. :D
<Sick_icybeauti> Vordox: I had such bad experiences with some of them...I hate all of them
<VenHur> Sidescrolling of the 2D Mario games, speed of the Sonic games, 2D/3D of Super Paper Mario, an customizable weapon system, etc.
<Vordox> Sick_icybeauti: *Pats*
<CriticKitten> And you end up with Calculus students who can't do Algebra
<Vordox> So have you tried the game, shizumobile ? =3
<Time> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvGzj6bJi7c&feature=plcp
<Vordox> Time: There's a stream going on
*Vordox slaps Time's hands.
<Time> There is?
<Michael|sad> no video links on stream
<Sick_icybeauti> I did go into lookign why are system "is" failing (And I emphasize the is becasue it failed pretty much :P)
<Time> I'll refresh.
<thelonepony> so, what game is this?
<VenHur> And time traveling of Chrono Trigger.
<SpeedyBolt> It feels weird listening to guns while playing Sonic R
<Time> Ok. ;)
<Michael|sad> thelonepony: quake 4
<Sick_icybeauti> Remeber kids, only vid allowed during stream is the welcome wagon
<VenHur> ...Yeah, I know, unoriginal concept, but it can sold well.
<thelonepony> Michael|sad: thanks :)
<Vordox> SHOTTY
<Vordox> BEST WEP FTW
<Derp_Derp> floof
<Michael|sad> dat shotgun
<Sick_icybeauti> I really shoudl be writing my essay...
<VenHur> I'll explain more if you guys are still listening.
<Kammerjunk> I really should be sleeping.
<SpeedyBolt> Disregard Essay
<Kammerjunk> VenHur: I'm always listening.
<Kammerjunk> More than you know.
<Derp_Derp> all the floof
<SpeedyBolt> You shall stay with us...Forever~
<Sick_icybeauti> Beats writing about a dead dude.
*Michael|sad is listening
<Derp_Derp> is mine
<Vordox> You know what's weird...?
<Vordox> In earlier Quake, the logotyp was used almost everywhere
<Vordox> I've yet not seen it here
<KandarihuFastBreak20> Well the government picking winners and losers isn't the right way for things to go. In capitalism, the customer picks winners and losers. And the government just has to let the best company win and punish the companies who do bad things, and let the companies that can't adapt suffer.
<Afflict> brb
<CriticKitten> Not what I meant
<CriticKitten> :P
<VenHur> While I haven't thinked of an story for my video game project, it does revolves around a time travelling/dimensions theme.
<Michael|sad> oh capitalism
<KandarihuFastBreak20> CriticKitten, oh. Right. Sorry for delving into that tangent, then.
<SpeedyBolt> Ooh, I should play a game I never beat
<SpeedyBolt> Sonic 2GG
<Vordox> VenHur: Oh Sci FI?
<AJIsAwesome> Good afternoon, everyone. How are you all today? :)
<Kammerjunk> VenHur: Best theme right there.
<Michael|sad> ohai AJIsAwesome, and today is a bad day :(
<Invi> it seems like i had luck with the school where i was in ^^ We just had a big bunch of drug dealers, but no actual violence ^^
<CriticKitten> Anyways, yes I know I ranted, I do apologize for that. I'm just tired of coming home and feeling like absolute shit. I'd like nothing more than to have my job be fulfilling, but it's anything but.
<Sick_icybeauti> But the "tougher standards" We need some kind of standard, but when it's getting to the point that kindergartens don't have playgrounds, you have a problem.
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Better than awkward silence, as far as I'm concerned.
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Make your workplace better
*Sick_icybeauti hugs CrimsonPhoenix
<AJIsAwesome> Michael|sad: What's wrong? :(
*Sick_icybeauti hugs CriticKitten
<SpeedyBolt> Accept Fate
<CrimsonPhoenix> ACK
<CriticKitten> I'm more talking about "forcing kids to redo a grade level when they can't add or subtract, rather than allowing them into high school", Sick_incybeauti
<Vordox> SpeedyBolt: No, fuck Fate
<Sick_icybeauti> opps...Didn't tab enough lol
<Vordox> Make your own
<Celestia`s_Bunny> BLOULOULOULOULOULOU!!
<Michael|sad> AJIsAwesome: my aunt died...
<SpeedyBolt> But Vordox
<SpeedyBolt> FAAAAAAAATE
<thelonepony> Michael|sad: :(
<Vordox> but SpeedyBolt, CONTROL YOUR LIFE
<CriticKitten> And you probably think I'm exaggerating there. I am so not.
<thelonepony> ohai Ayejay
<Celestia`s_Bunny> I`M GOING TO CHANGE EVERYONES FATE!! MWAHAHAHAHA
<AJIsAwesome> Michael|sad: Man, that sucks. You have my condolences. :(
<Sick_icybeauti> CriticKitten: I actually heard a case of where a senior in new jersey didn't know how to read in 12t grade, and he got pushed through the system
<Michael|sad> thanks AJIsAwesome
<shana> <3 quake cosole
<SpeedyBolt> If you choose to control your life, fate told you to control your life
<CriticKitten> I've had students who can't add or subtract. In my high school classes. You may now weep for humanity.'
<SpeedyBolt> Faaaaaaaaaaate~ -killed-
<KandarihuFastBreak21> Michael|sad, you have my condolences too
<MadSurge> Hello AJIsAwesome :)
<AJIsAwesome> Michael|sad: No problem. Just take it easy.
<thelonepony> Celestia`s_Bunny: If you have the death note :D
<SpeedyBolt> CriticKitten: Who cant ADD?
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Hello. :)
<Sick_icybeauti> We were doing a mapof europe, a kid didn't know where spain was...
<thelonepony> hai Ayejay
<CriticKitten> SpeedyBolt: Yep.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, thelonepony. :)
<Invi> thelonepony, then bunny still needs our real names ^^
<Michael|sad> thanks y'all for your condolences :)
<SpeedyBolt> I've lost hope for all of humanity now.
<thelonepony> Invi: that too :D
<Celestia`s_Bunny> thelonepony: forget the death note, I just bow and arrow
<Sick_icybeauti> And my entire table didn't know who our vice president is...
<Brand> Does anyone know if they will be 1080p livestreaming season 3?
<Invi> ja
<Vordox> CriticKitten: So what you think of the cause then?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> i dont know who the vice president is either
<thelonepony> Celestia`s_Bunny: But you will never hit me Katniss :D
<twoiloight_spurnkle> neither do i care
<Brand> Richard Nixon
<SpeedyBolt> Nichard Rixon
<Celestia`s_Bunny> thelonepony: I`ll get aimbot
<CriticKitten> Just remember these facts the next time you say "we should get rid of the Electoral College". Because the alternative is that THESE kids get to vote for the president directly. :D
<Brand> Al Gore
<Invi> Why not Zoidberg?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> crazy al
<CriticKitten> Vordox: It's cultural.
<Jmo> FFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<Brand> Obama is our vice
<Vordox> CriticKitten: where do you live?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> lawl jaymoo
<Sick_icybeauti> I might know. So in kindergarten, they need everyone to know the alphabet. A few kids might remember it, but a majority parrot it just to get by. It isn't taking in the information, they just do it not to get penalized.
<thelonepony> Celestia`s_Bunny: That is not MLG >:I
<CriticKitten> They're raised in an environment where lack of effort is encouraged.
<Michael|sad> lol
<Celestia`s_Bunny> thelonepony: forgrt MLG
<KandarihuFastBreak21> Welcome to the Obamination, folks
<twoiloight_spurnkle> i also dont know the alphabet :P
<SpeedyBolt> The Alphabet is the easiest bet
<thelonepony> Sprunkls Neither do i :P
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/14e4af1152ec2f8ef9515e7c1eb8eb86.png down Dashie, DOWN
<VenHur> Continuing on the subject of my video game project...
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: It started long prior to Obama.
<Sick_icybeauti> And then dumb peopel get shoved through the system. I know kids who didn't even pass last year get shoved inot high school. That's saying soemthing.
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: :D
<Vordox> VenHur: How much coding can you do?
<Michael|sad> Invi: (V) (;,,;) (V)
<shizumobile> Anyone else notice how short these maps are
<twoiloight_spurnkle> well actually
<Time> e.o
<Michael|sad> lol
<twoiloight_spurnkle> i do know the english alphabet cause the alphabet song
<CriticKitten> It's been going on since....at least the Reagan years.
<Invi> :D
<KandarihuFastBreak21> CriticKitten, I suppose so. But Romney would probably do something about it
<Celestia`s_Bunny> KandarihuFastBreak21: better than Romney though
<Vordox> shizumobile: Fine by me. :P They are still good quality on variation
<Invi> twoiloight_spurnkle, there is an alphabet song? :3
<VenHur> Well, I had to say this, but coding ALL the game by myself may takes a hell of a long time... ^-^||
<SpeedyBolt> Everybody at my school doesnt like Obama
<Sick_icybeauti> Back in the before about the 60's, we actually had one of the best educational systems ever. I don't know what happened.
<Vordox> VenHur: Tried Game Maker?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> yus Invi , its quite helpful for people with terrible memory like me :D
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: It's not Romney's job to. Education should be a state issue. The feds keep making it worse.
<Celestia`s_Bunny> SpeedyBolt: RACISTS
<VenHur> Vordox: I'll might look it up.
<SpeedyBolt> Not even the blacks
<Vordox> VenHur: 2D or 3D?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> ERMAGERD THEY VOTED AGAINST OBAMA, THEY MUST BE RACIST
<KandarihuFastBreak21> CriticKitten, he'd make it a state issue again.
<Sick_icybeauti> That's why I have to write this essay I have. They think if kids do reading.writing practice in other classes, they'll score better...But nope.
<Invi> twoiloight_spurnkle, but... how fast can you tell me the alphabet backwards?
<CriticKitten> No Child Left Behind = no standards, because it's more important to pass kids through the system so our numbers look good.
<SpeedyBolt> Not fast at all
<Celestia`s_Bunny> Romney sucks
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Invi: veeery slowly :P
<VenHur> Vordox: A mixture of two, both centered on camera control, and the gameplay.
<Michael|sad> politics in BS :o
<Sick_icybeauti> We actually need someone who can fix this up, but it's going to take a shit load.
<Vordox> VenHur: Game Maker handles 2D well, but it's harder to make use of 3D
<SpeedyBolt> Oh, guys
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Actually that wasn't his platform. It was in Ron Paul's platform, and Perry's.
<Celestia`s_Bunny> POLITICS GO AWAY
<Vordox> VenHur: If you want 3D, It's either Unity3d or UDK3
<Buytoast> man, Gamemaker
<SpeedyBolt> During a class yesterday, we were learning about gods
<Buytoast> I haven't used that in a while
<Vordox> VenHur: Otherwise, Game Maker makes good use for 2D
<twoiloight_spurnkle> SpeedyBolt: history?
<Vordox> Buytoast: What? :P
<CriticKitten> Which is why I liked Paul, incidentally.
<Invi> also: without looking: what colors (in the right order) does the google logo have? :D
<Celestia`s_Bunny> SpeedyBolt: greek gods?
<SpeedyBolt> "So students, who is the god of war"
<twoiloight_spurnkle> aries
<Sick_icybeauti> Aries???
<SpeedyBolt> Everybody but me. Said. Kratos.
<Michael|sad> kratos
<killerpony7733> Inb4 kratos
<twoiloight_spurnkle> isnt mars also
<killerpony7733> hahaha
<CriticKitten> KANE?
<RoboGerbil> depends on which pantheon youre using
<SpeedyBolt> I was like "Are you all retarded?"
<Buytoast> that Game Maker thing i bought about a year ago that i haven't used since that class
<KandarihuFastBreak21> I really should be as dedicated to paying attention to my fast breaking as I was to my fast.
<CriticKitten> DOWN WITH GDI!
<CriticKitten> <_<
<Vordox> Buytoast: You have no will to make games or prototypes?
<SpeedyBolt> lol
<Vordox> CriticKitten: *GASP* YOUR TRUE FACE
<Celestia`s_Bunny> CriticKitten: GDI?
<Buytoast> no time really these days
<CriticKitten> I swear that guy said Kane.
<Sick_icybeauti> I remember last eyar, my teacher asked who the presidental canidates are. I was the only one who knew...:(
<killerpony7733> CriticKitten NOD scum! :[
<Vordox> Buytoast: There's always time
<Vordox> Buytoast: It's the worst excuse there is
<Buytoast> HA
<Buytoast> AHAHAHA
<CriticKitten> killerpony7733: It's pronounced "The Brotherhood of NOD", thank you
<Buytoast> not when you're taking classes there isn't
<SpeedyBolt> Yeah, there's always
<SpeedyBolt> TIme
<Vordox> Buytoast: 27 years old, having 3 side project, and 1 School Project going on right now, And I am in College, working and educating from 7 am to 7 PM.
<Invi> CriticKitten, what classes do you actually teach?
<Vordox> So yes, there is Buytoast :P
<Buytoast> that's nice
<Invi> *subjects
<killerpony7733> CriticKitten Meh you filthy NOD people are all the same and deserve no respect :)
<Buytoast> doesn't mean there's time for everyone
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: you teach?
<Vordox> Buytoast: Depends on what you have to sacrifice
<CriticKitten> Invi: It's a mix. I've got some remedial Algebra kids, and also AP Calculus kids.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> sacrifice a leg
<Jlc> What Game?
<CriticKitten> So the full spectrum.
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: No, I'm just like to overspend time on my creations
<Vordox> <--- Perfectionist.
<Buytoast> not e4verything can be sacrifised
<Vordox> And always hate what I end up with...
<CriticKitten> He DID say Kane@!
<MadSurge> If anything, CriticKitten, here in Italy students are clamoring to have funds put back into uni and school. And we do greek gods since kindergarten :D
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: what creations
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Game Designer
<Sick_icybeauti> CriticKitten: Math.....Generally, that's where the worst grades I see happen.
<Vordox> I WANT THE UNIVERSE
<Vordox> I get a planet
<Vordox> That kind of thing :p
<Michael|sad> lawl
<SpeedyBolt> I want a planet
<SpeedyBolt> I'll name it Broniseus
<Buytoast> ah, Game Design
<Celestia`s_Bunny> I want a plant
<Buytoast> get ready fora future of making Call of Duty rehashes
<CriticKitten> Sick_icybeauti: That's because it's also the most work-intensive class
<Vordox> Buytoast: How to create interesting games... :P
<Vordox> Buytoast: FUCK NO
<Vordox> Buytoast: I'm a 2D Specialist
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Sick_icybeauti: not true, thats chemistry
<Celestia`s_Bunny> Buytoast: NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Michael|sad> i want to meet shen long
<Vordox> Buytoast: My weakness is 3D or 3D Engines(UDK)
<SpeedyBolt> Teehee
<SpeedyBolt> Morris
<Sick_icybeauti> CriticKitten: That too. You atually have to know what you're doing. twoiloight_spurnkle Science too.
<shizumobile> Maybe I should run doom 3 again?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #619
<Vordox> shizumobile: What about the gift I gave you? =3
<Invi> nighty everypony ^^
<MadSurge> Now, are friendly soldiers immune to friendly fire shizumobile?
<Michael|sad> Gnight Invi
<Buytoast> i enjoy the 2d stuff too
<shizumobile> Have not got to it yet
<Vordox> Buytoast: which ones?
<Vordox> shizumobile: Awww, well in due time
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Invi. :)
<Vordox> shizumobile: Just so you know! Nittany has it too!
<Buytoast> a shame i don't have time to work on it more with all this other shit
<AJIsAwesome> Take care!
<SpeedyBolt> Morris is such a funny name
<Buytoast> just 2d stuff that plays good
<SpeedyBolt> It makes me giggle everytime I hear it
<thelonepony> Night Invi :)
<twoiloight_spurnkle> bye Invi
<RoboGerbil> november 15 star wars ToR goes f2p
<Buytoast> ToR was DoA
<CriticKitten> Raven Squad? Is their call signal "Nevermore"?
<Buytoast> and it's still dead
<shizumobile> This guy was in minority report btw
<Vordox> Buytoast: Nah, it had a great start.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> RoboGerbil: lol did they plan that or are they doing it because nobody's playing?
<shizumobile> Also Steve blum
<RoboGerbil> twoiloight_spurnkle: a bit of both
<Vordox> shizumobile: You know what's fun...?
<Vordox> shizumobile: You're trained in Military, never aim at your allies
<Vordox> shizumobile: But to TALK To them you need to do it
<Michael|sad> *marine*
<Vordox> And that's where the feeling of the game for me drops big time
<RoboGerbil> bioware was for the f2p model from the start but EA wanted nothing to do with it.
<Bronysith> HOLY SHIT
<Bronysith> death battle Link Vs cloud
<Vordox> Bronysith: I don't agree with the outcome
<Vordox> Bronysith: On one side, we have a God, on the other, a measly time traveler
<Vordox> And the God Loses?
<Vordox> I call bs
<Michael|sad> Bronysith: cloud should win :(
<VenHur> Link would won, I mean, come on, he had a shield, Cloud don't. That's All Folks.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> cloud as in the final fantasy cloud?
<CriticKitten> Love how Shizu nods and shakes her head in the game. XD
<Vordox> VenHur: Cloud has super powers to CALL DOWN THE GOD DAMN UNIVERSE on Link
<Vordox> "Lolnope, forgot that"
<Michael|sad> cloud have Odin
<CriticKitten> "What were you doing, chatting with the other squads?" *nodnodnod*
<CriticKitten> ded
<Vordox> CriticKitten: That's a sign showing that she's really enjoying the game? :P
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: since when doe he have that power?
<VenHur> ...But more on the serious matter, Link will win because he had a tons of weapons in his arsenal, bombs, arrows, the Hookshot, etc!
<RoboGerbil> this quake 4?
<killerpony7733> CriticKitten Adds humor :P
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Apocalyze? :P
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Let's see, Calling great powers from all over the world, and universe
<Vordox> *check*
<Jmo> MAX
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: maybe its because i didnt play ff7, but i didnt know he was so powerful. even sephiroth cant do that, and hes stronger than cloud, its canon
<Michael|sad> brb
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: If Sephi is stronger then Cloud, why did Cloud "kill" him so easy?
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: And I am speaking Early game
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: because he screws around too much. and sephiroth Is the strongest character in the ff7 universe, writers said it, its canon
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: LAWL
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: You forgot other people.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: what other people? the writers said it
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Zack, Rufus(Heallo!), Cloud, Sephiroth, Vincent
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Writers says alot, but they are wrong. :P
<CriticKitten> *nodnodnod*
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: ...they WROTE the story
<Vivix> writers create the world, we interpret it
<Vordox> The GAME shows the story, and the story says otherwise.
<SpeedyBolt> I think i'll modify textures in SA2 now...
<shizumobile> You can hear my silent excited giggling :)
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: the writers Define the story, if they say its true then it is, they Created the world. im not talking about in-game, im talking story-wise
<Vordox> shizumobile: UNLIMITED POWAAAH
<Vivix> that includes the movie right?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> yes Vivix
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: "Sephi is stronger" *Cloud wins every Sephi fight* *Sephi is strongest* "wtf here"
<Vivix> stronger doesn't mean autowin
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: i already told you why
<VenHur> SpeedyBolt: You're going to modernize it, aren't you?
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Yeah but as I said
<Vivix> I can barely remember the movie-
<SpeedyBolt> Nah
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: he screws around too much
<Vordox> The GAME is where we are, writers are on the othe side
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: That I won't deny. :P
<SpeedyBolt> VenHur: I'm going to rape everything
<Vordox> SpeedyBolt: ?
<VenHur> SpeedyBolt: Oh...well, I would love to see an SA2 HD Edition.
<SpeedyBolt> Dont we have one of those?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: in terms of-ingame character playability, idk whos the strongest. but story and canon-wise, sephiroth is the strongets
<VenHur> SpeedyBolt: Let me know if the project is in works.
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Want me to take an extreme example and suprise you about writers?
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Seifer KILLED A FUCKING GOD
<SpeedyBolt> VenHur: probably unlikely, Generations hacking seems to be the biggest thing right now
<Vordox> Seifer = Mid hard boss person
<Vordox> MIND BLOWN
<Afflict> Hey shibaru
<Vordox> I don't care about the story as one aspect, the game is the full complete telling.
<Vordox> It's like saying Twilight is good. :P
<Vivix> then you're discussing two different things Vordox
<Vordox> Vivix: Technically, I'm discussing the game, which is the part where people are playing it
<Vivix> F1 has a story and time line that is canon, that is not related to player choice
<Vordox> And that's assembled by tons of aspects.
<Vivix> he's discussing the story and the canonity of it
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: cloud was never a god, and he wasnt even as powerful as sephiroth, which is canon, so link couldve beaten him
<Vivix> look at openchoice and most rpg games have an "ideal timeline" and history for further canon- that's the canon story, your choices strengths and interpretations aren't in those games. I don't know about FF but it's normal many times
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: And what the hell is Link then?
<Vordox> XD
<Bronysith> why did link win
<Bronysith> that is fucking bullshit
<Vordox> Bronysith: Better question
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: cloud was never even that powerful
<twoiloight_spurnkle> but idk about link
<twoiloight_spurnkle> my point is that cloud is not a god, and he cant call down the end of the universe
<Vivix> what, a spiderman vs superman ish discussion?
<Vordox> Bronysith: I know, compared to Cloud(WHO KILLS THE "Strongest character in the fuc'king FF7 UNIVERSE), why did Link win?
<Vordox> LAWL
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Meteor materia says what? :P
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: well, sephiroth let him win because he was messing around
<MadSurge> Pfffft Sephiroth is overrated\
<Vordox> MadSurge: Agreed.
<SpeedyBolt> Because Link defeats Ganon everytime, over and over, in a same-dif way
<SpeedyBolt> ...Aside from that one Timeline
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: the meteor calls down a comet, its not the end of the universe. sephiroth used it but couldnt ccomplete it
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: He did messaround, but that should not be his undoing. If you watch the full game on all Sephi's events.
<SpeedyBolt> Speaking of Sephiroth
<SpeedyBolt> i really need to play a FF game someday
<MadSurge> Kefka could kick Pretty Boy's nards everyday :D
<Vordox> MadSurge: kefka isn't strong'
<Vordox> He's just smart.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: there are other factors in play. yeah cloud is strong an all, but had sephiroth fought at full strength with no outside factors, cloud wouldnt win, like i said tis canon
<MadSurge> SpeedyBolt: try the SNES era ones, they're good :)
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: If tis is canon
<Vordox> Show it
<Vordox> All I hear is "Writers SAID", not written OR SHOWN or anything, just "said" :P
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: you want the quote of the writer?
<shizumobile> Sorry bout thqt, phone call
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Please.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> i'll try to find t
<twoiloight_spurnkle> *it
<MadSurge> Vordox: also he's nuts, which made him do things a sane person would never think to do
<Vordox> In my game universe, the strongest is a cockroach
<Vordox> There, I f'cking up my game. :P
<MadSurge> Vordox: :D
<shizumobile> Blum!
<Vordox> shizumobile: I wonder... Why is it that things haven't gotten to hell yet?
<shizumobile> NEEEEEEEEERDS

<SpeedyBolt> Wait...what is that?
<SpeedyBolt> Stupid Copypaste thing
<MadSurge> SpeedyBolt: if you do, remember they're old RPGs and their story might be a cliche storm :D
<SpeedyBolt> I dont mind stoires
<SpeedyBolt> *stories
<SpeedyBolt> Well, like those anyways. I've heard lots in my time.
<SpeedyBolt> and then everybody died
<AJIsAwesome> Question: How can I add a mini description under my dA name? :)
<AJIsAwesome> Testing.
<SafariMonkey> Hi AJIsAwesome, it works
<RoboGerbil> chats ded
<AJIsAwesome> Ah. :D
<MadSurge> SpeedyBolt: there's a good version of FF4 for the DS, but it's fond of dick moves from the enemies :D the GBA one is also good in translation, but it's easier than the original :D
<SpeedyBolt> Thanks for the info
<SpeedyBolt> and while learning and looking through files...I found the Chao textures
<SpeedyBolt> Time to spray paint their eyes blood red :$
<KandarihuFastBreak22> What game is this? Quake 4?
<SafariMonkey> SpeedyBolt: Texture editing? :)
<SafariMonkey> Hello eli!
<SafariMonkey> *Hello Eli! :)
<SpeedyBolt> SafariMonkey: Eeyup, and Hi :$
<AJIsAwesome> Gah, my internet died. Did someone ping me?

<KandarihuFastBreak22> I ask again, what game is this?
<Eli> so 10 episode marathon after movie night tomorrow?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm so weak when there are soundtracks in the line ...

<Eli> SafariMonkey: youp. too fast for my little slow lump of a brain today
<AJIsAwesome> Also, I have no idea what this game is. SOrry. :)

<SafariMonkey> Thanks Shizuka!
*Vordox hugs Shizuka
<GeneralKai> Lol I just missed it didn't I
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah. :D
<GeneralKai> Well, I saw him press exit
<AJIsAwesome> Her. :)
<GeneralKai> Her
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<KaitoThePony> d:D b
<GeneralKai> Hola
<Jmo> Allo GilDash
<SafariMonkey> Hi GilDash
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, GilDash! :)
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: i found one of the quotes, i'll pm it
<Eli> and the movies are good too! i don't know the B movie, but How to train your dragon was one of the best animated movies in the last years :) this is gonna be one awesome weekend
<GeneralKai> So Season 3 will be streamed here?
<AJIsAwesome> Jetsons Movie. :)
<SafariMonkey> Eli: Agreed!
<AJIsAwesome> GeneralKai: Yep! :)
<SafariMonkey> Anyone here got Halo 4 yet? :P
<GeneralKai> When'd it release
<AJIsAwesome> I don't play Halo. Sorry. :D
<SafariMonkey> GeneralKai: 6th
<VenHur> I don't had any Halo games either.
<Eli> wait... jetsons? isn't that the family from the flintstones?
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome: Nor do I, my friends do though.
<GilDash> I still remember the original Halo: Combat Evolved. :S
<GeneralKai> That 1 good?
<SafariMonkey> GilDash: Have you tried the anniversary edition?
<GilDash> SafariMonkey: Nope. I've still got the original hanging around somewhere though.
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: *facepalm*
<Vordox> Dude...
<Vordox> That's the ANIMATION
<Vordox> Not the game
<Vordox> =P
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: so what, its the same canon
<SafariMonkey> GilDash: It's pretty good, you can switch between original and new graphics. :P
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Are you certain?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: its the movie, yes it is the same canon
<Afflict> oh awesome. what game you playing?
<GilDash> SafariMonkey: So I've heard. I just can't be arsed to get it when I've got the original already. I'm not interested in the multiplayer, so... meh.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> it has to be the same canon
<twoiloight_spurnkle> it happens after the events of ff7
<twoiloight_spurnkle> they directly mention it
<GeneralKai> Movies and such get streamed here also right?
<shibaru> Makin miis lol
<KandarihuFastBreak22> SafariMonkey, thanks
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: "The music was composed by Final Fantasy veteran Nobuo Uematsu, while the series' long-time character designer, Yoshitaka Amano, was replaced by Tetsuya Nomura."
<AJIsAwesome> GeneralKai: Yep, on BMN and random times when they feel like it. :)
<GeneralKai> BMN?
<AJIsAwesome> Brony Movie Night. :)
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: so? it follows the same canon, different writer or not. if its the same story line, they cant just change it, doesnt matter who writes it
<GeneralKai> Which day
<twoiloight_spurnkle> friday
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: "So"?
<Vordox> Your quote is from a Character Designer
<Vordox> Not a Story writer. :P
<SafariMonkey> GilDash: http://files-5.123kinect.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/halo-comparison.jpg
<GeneralKai> Woooo time to make some plans
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: yes and the character designer designed him to be the most powerdful character. the story cant go against the character design
<SafariMonkey> Apples*12
<twoiloight_spurnkle> its kind of the same thing really
<SafariMonkey> :P
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: No he didn't
<Vordox> All your facts are ALL over the place
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: the character designer said that the character is tthe most powerful one, what else d oyou want
<MadSurge> Hey GilDash! :$
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<GeneralKai> Whens the movies start tomorrow?
<GilDash> MadSurge: Holla! :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Sketch_Toku_Brony. :)
<AJIsAwesome> 7PM EST. :)
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: A graphical artist pointing out stuff that he does not know?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> GeneralKai: theres a countdown clock top-right
<twoiloight_spurnkle> *top-left
<MadSurge> GeneralKai: see the counter over the strean box?
<Vordox> I could say that Shizuka is the most powerful mod in the world
<GeneralKai> Thanks
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so S3 debuts tommorow or saturday? just wanna make sure :$
<MadSurge> *stream
<Vordox> And all of asudden it's true?
<Shizuka> 13you would be wrong but you could
<Vivix> Not even similar in any regard that example Vordox
<Vordox> Shizuka: <3
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Saturday. :)
<Vordox> Vivix: Really?
<Vivix> yeah
<Vordox> I have NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ok thanks AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> :)
<Vivix> this isn't a story
<Vordox> Who cares what I say, it's not my department :P
<Vivix> so it's not even comparable
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: indeed, he's actually a part of the team. and as character designer, he has a say in the matter
<Vivix> You have a better example in you, I know it
<Vivix> that was a horrible one
<Vivix> Depending on what the char'designers responsibility in the game was, yeah- depending on what the team had agreed on or what messages he had been told
<Vordox> Vivix: You want facts? brb
<Vivix> he might have said it's the most powerful because he was told to do so
<MadSurge> So Shizuka, how's life?
<Vivix> no I don't vordox, I don't care about this game
<Vordox> Here's one for you twoiloight_spurnkle
<Vordox> Character designer Tetsuya Nomura wanted his role in the story to be different from other Final Fantasy villains, while his design was intended to contrast directly with that of the game's main character, Cloud Strife.
<Vordox> I see
<Vivix> You're not wrong, but your example and logic was awful
<Vordox> NOTHING
<Vordox> About being designed to "Look the strongest"
<twoiloight_spurnkle> ...
<Vordox> Want more facts? brb
<twoiloight_spurnkle> because cloud Isnt the strongest?
<MadSurge> Vordox: :D nothing screams "the strongest" like longe white hair :D
<Phase4> 00,02i wish all games came with their soundtrack
<Vordox> MadSurge: Nomura has stated that Sephiroth was made to be a complete contrast to the game's main protagonist, Cloud, who was originally designed to have slicked-back, black hair with no spikes.
<DoctoDoctorWho> sup guys
<Vordox> COME ON
<Vordox> FACE ME WITH YOUR FACTS
<Vordox> I DARE OYU
<Phase4> 00,02its pretty pointless charging you extra for it when the game itself includes the soundtrack
<Vivix> Don't get riled up and stupid
<twoiloight_spurnkle> what the hell are you even quoting?
<MadSurge> Vordox: I see :O
<Vivix> god knows
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol wha :D
<Vivix> graphical artist design notes it seems
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Something you don't even know = Sudden realization:P
<Vordox> Vivix: Correct, about Sephiroth's concept and creation
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: ...none of that has ANY relevance
<GilDash> Vordox: Well, that's because Zack was going to be the main character.
<Vordox> GilDash: Technically, yes. :P
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: youre only quoting Parts of the Visual aspects. not only are there more aspects, but he also talks with the entire team and Knows what they were intended to be
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: *sigh* what are you arguing this time?
<Vivix> I still don't see how this relates to the other examples, if a team member has said something about that regarding somethign they have been told or told to do, it can't be held as canon, but if its linked further in the story, such as the movies, it is
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: He was created to COUNTERPART with the arly drafts of Cloud
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: design wise.
<Buytoast> are you people still arguing about some giant haired kid being a god or something?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: ..yes, some Parts of the Visual design
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep most of the time i just search the files of the game ._.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> and also he was never a god
<twoiloight_spurnkle> when did that even happen
<twoiloight_spurnkle> and neither is he able to cause the end ofthe world
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: And about your animation
<Vordox> For Advent Children, the film sequel to Final Fantasy VII, script writer Kazushige Nojima thought that the film's plot would be less entertaining without Sephiroth. His revival in the film was introduced in the early stages of development, but the official decision as to how to bring him back was not reached until later.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> aaaaand?
<Vivix> ^^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 is DSL a good linux for starters ? should i try ubuntu first
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Aaaand your point is breaking down on 2 fronts
<Phase4> 00,02DSL is old and unmaintained
<Vordox> Here the script is writing itself
<Vivix> I don't even have any emotion invested in this- it's just such a straaange argument
<Vordox> Not prepared
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: its only the script of the movie, its only them deciding what the movie is goingto be about, it says nothing about canonity
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: ...
<Vordox> What?
<Phase4> 00,02also not the best to start with imho, core linux does what dsl used to do but they're for really old machines/spesific needs
<DoctoDoctorWho> I know he has a giant ass sword, thats as far as Im going with this.
<Vordox> Script is not canon anymore?
<Vordox> =P
<Jmo> Holy shit, talk about taking things too far.
<Phase4> 00,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT, depends on what you want really
<Vordox> Okay, fine, you win, script doesn't mean canon.
<Vivix> Vordox, script planning discussions are not canon
<Vivix> that's--totally stupid
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bitch don't know 'bout my galactus
<Vivix> dev-speak isn't canon, so anythign the team has said about anyone strength outside of a script or game isn't really canon either
<Phase4> 00,02ubuntu if you want everything to 'just work'
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: dude youre not even talking about the script, all that quote says is that they were thinking what to make the movie about. what does it have to do with character canonity
<DoctoDoctorWho> galactus kicks numerus asses, /)
<twoiloight_spurnkle> dat otakon
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: ...
<Vordox> I assume you don't know sublines?
<alexxm> oh whos streaming
<twoiloight_spurnkle> dari is
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> meh just want to get the feel of it/ learn the basic i probably will need it sometime soon
<prince-dari> wat
<Jmo> Dabi is streaming?
<Jmo> wat
<Jmo> Bullshit.
<prince-dari> Whoops
<twoiloight_spurnkle> lawl
<prince-dari> I opened FME
<prince-dari> But I didn't realise it was streaming
<AJIsAwesome> ?
<Jmo> Newb.
<Vivix> Accidental stream
<twoiloight_spurnkle> crap i shouldve kept quiet and spied on dabi
<prince-dari> It starting streaming by itself
<prince-dari> It's never done that before
<AJIsAwesome> I didn't refresh, so I didn't kwo. :P
<Jmo> Lul
<Jmo> I hax'd it
<AJIsAwesome> *know
<Vivix> And no I have no idea what sublines is, but I don't think anything can make up for that last quote. It's like taking faust's crippleloo as canon before it's ever been done in the show
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: that quote has nothing to do with the matter
<Buytoast> my stream is streaming on it's own
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: It has facts on it
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: and subline isnt the proper word
<Time> I have no stream
<Vivix> about the planning?
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Not Subline, Sublines
<Vordox> Different thing
<Vivix> Don't exist in any of my dictionaries, so explain it
<twoiloight_spurnkle> ^
<Ponymon_Anarchy> hello all
<twoiloight_spurnkle> i couldnt find anything either
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: absolutely irrelevant facts, only facts about them thinking what to make the movie about, it has nothing to do with character canon
<twoiloight_spurnkle> hoi Ponymon_Anarchy
<Vivix> Technically, that's why we can't REALLY call Chrysalis name canon
<Ponymon_Anarchy> GigabitHarmonie: hello
<CrimsonPhoenix> twoiloight_spurnkle, what are you trying to bring here?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Ponymon_Anarchy. :)

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ubuntu*
<twoiloight_spurnkle> CrimsonPhoenix: well Vordox said that cloud is a god and is the ost powerful character of ff7 and can destroy the universe
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Not destroy it, but handle it. :P
<Vivix> so that's what the discussion is?
<CrimsonPhoenix> well he did beat sephiroth right?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> CrimsonPhoenix: it began by him saying cloud shouldve won that vs link battle video
<CrimsonPhoenix> Really?
<Gekoncze> its 00::00 here, so I have to go, night
<CrimsonPhoenix> Death Battle is horrible
<twoiloight_spurnkle> CrimsonPhoenix: yeah but sephiroth messed around too much, llike i said its cann that sephiroth is stronger

<AttackWithHugs|AFK> ONE DAY
<Vordox> You know, twoiloight_spurnkle. This is all based on one single point.
<Vordox> A character designer giving a quote of a writer that had written the script but the actual game of the aesthetic told otherwise.
<Jmo> egh
<AJIsAwesome> hge
<Paspie> hey hey
<thelonepony> Hi Paspie :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Paspie. :)
<FutApplejack> Helauw Paspie
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: it didnt tell otherwise, just because he won doesnt mean hes stronger. if a writer says so, aka the Creator of said universe, id say its true
<Vordox> The...creator?
<Vivix> but there's a strange kernel there
<Vordox> wtf you on about?
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: HEY
<Vordox> Kitase was the revisioner of Sakaguchi's work
<Vivix> if a writer or team of writers states something that was never expressed, it can't be fully canonized
<Vordox> Vivix: Indeed, the product says all what's needed.
<FutApplejack> When do you think alpha 1.4 will be done?
<Vivix> yees but the interpretation of a product might not always be canon either
<Vivix> hence fanon
<FutApplejack> I'm impatient for it
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/MkeWX.jpg
<Vordox> Vivix: The sad truth. Mystify games with no real answers.
<Vivix> I've never played it- but it's really hard to tell from the game?
<Vivix> Or hte movies for that matter
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vivix: well he wasnt the only one who said it, producers said it too. if anything, a word from the team itself is more important
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Anyway, as said, Hironobu wrote the first script, but Kitase and Kazushige Nojima revisioner the script.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gosh nothing is better than watching two dogs barking at each other to prove how alpha they are in the pack
<Vivix> it is more important than fanon in most cases- but it's a sticky mud issue
<Vordox> So the creator is Hironobu, not Kitase.
<Vivix> it's like crippleloo and deerboy-
<CrimsonPhoenix> POPCORN ANYONE?
<Vivix> that would be a great comic
<alexxm> oh ponymon
<prince-dari> Stream is up
<Vivix> Crippleloo and Deerboooyy
<KandarihuFastBreak24> That's a fake screenshot, isn't it?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: i meant creators not as in the original writers, i meant as in the part of the team that actually defines the rules of said world
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix, it's best if you don't rile or instigate anything. It's civil as it is. DOn't make it worse.
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: And they were aspect of the game, which tells that Sephi is not the strongest.
<SafariMonkey> Oh thanks dari
<Vordox> :P
<MadSurge> :D DAT IMAGE
<Vivix> can you point to those aspects?
*Vivix tries not to soudn rude, but hasn't played the game
<AJIsAwesome> prince-dari: So who's being interviewed?
<Buytoast> oh no the heralds of the end
<Vordox> Vivix: FFVII all aspects? Gameplay, Audio, Visual.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol dat not very efeective yay
<MadSurge> :O
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: but there are no such aspects, as i said, sephiroth never was serious enough. that was also said by nomura
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, it's just arguments going around
<Vivix> well the specific points that show his strength over sephiroth
<Buytoast> they echo across the plains, bringing the force of reckoning
<Vivix> but if sephi was in the movie, he did survive the game?
<prince-dari> Discord Drocsid
<twoiloight_spurnkle> hell in the movie there was a clear point where sephiroth couldve killed cloud
<Bronysith> Vivix: he was revived in the movie
<Vivix> Oh, I thoght cloud did die-
<twoiloight_spurnkle> he was in the ground and he couldve just stabbed him
<Vivix> Oh
<twoiloight_spurnkle> in the heart
<Vordox> Vivix: No, he died, Sephi died big time. :P
<twoiloight_spurnkle> but he stabbed him in the shoulder instead
<Vivix> Okay
<twoiloight_spurnkle> to torture hi mm
<Vivix> Yeah that's probably what I remember-
<twoiloight_spurnkle> *him
<MadSurge> prince-dari: another inteview?
<prince-dari> Yep
<MadSurge> *r
<MadSurge> Kk
<Vivix> So they're evenly ish matched, but sephis ego/arrogance is his downfall?
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Maybe, but your making it worse than it is right now. If they want to argue, that's fine. People argue all the time.
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: And Cloud killed Sephi with NO EFFORT EARLY IN THE GAME WITH A MORTAL WOUND TO THE body
<Vordox> Oh oops, WE FORGOT that part
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vivix: to be precise his body was destroyed, but the lifestream wasnt strong enough to absorb ins mind
*Vordox sighs and facepalm.
<AJIsAwesome> *you're
<Vivix> Okay, hm
<Derpy_Hooves> floof
<Vivix> Well I'm pretty sure they're both mortal
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: That's true, damn remnenant of Sephi :P
<Vivix> or well pretty sure is assuming- so not sure at all
<Vivix> but..probably
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, I'm fine with a good debate but when it becomes only two people and it goes around they could move it in PM and not cog the chat up
<Vordox> Vivix: Yeah and guess what, Sephi skewered Cloud Mortally, but Cloud still kicked his arse without any weapon and "technically" killed him
<Vordox> Vivix: But that point is moot, right?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: so? like i said it doesnt mean that sephiroth put everything in it and didnt screw around. Nomura Said he Never showed his true strength
<Vivix> not moot, no-
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: Numora Cant go against the entire canon by saying that
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: AND here is the problem then
<Vordox> "He never showed"
<Vordox> And you're trying to justify it's canon
<MadSurge> To me, laughing mad>serious mad. That's it
<Vordox> When never existing?
<Phase4> 00,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT, dont install it with wubi, burn it to a dvd and install from there
<Vivix> he never showed so we can't tell either way?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: no those are two different things
<Vordox> Vivix: THANK YOU
<Vivix> Aaah
<Vordox> Damnit, using caps...
<Phase4> 00,02wubi does some terrible hacks and stores the root fs on your c:\ partition, very bad idea
*Vordox slaps self.
<GilDash> MadSurge: I prefer dancing mad. XD
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: not only is it canon that he is the strongest, but its also canon he never displayed his true power which is why he lost
<Vivix> So it's in that weird place-
<MadSurge> GilDash: such a great theme
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: You're mixing something that never should be mixed then twoiloight_spurnkle .
<Vordox> Canon > HeadCanon
<Ponymon_Anarchy> Thats me :D
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: people from the team said it, its not headcanon
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ok, will do.
<Vivix> sadly, unofficial statements can't really be said to be canon-
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: It's headcanon.
<Vivix> it's sticky
<twoiloight_spurnkle> i guess you could say that also Vivix
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: how is it headcanon? headcanon of the writer in the least, which is still a major point
<Vordox> Headcanon are things that aren't really but it's stated to be, but they are not made therefore it's headcanon of the creators.
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: True, but I think it's fine as it is. Unless it comes to a point where several people are wanting to move said argument into PM is there a problem with the argument.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> its still a major point either way
<Vivix> yeah it's a big point but it depends, and since it depends it is very sticky
<Ponymon_Anarchy> god damn i sound horrible
<Vordox> Ponymon_Anarchy: Nah =3
<Ponymon_Anarchy> lol
<AJIsAwesome> Ponymon_Anarchy: You sound fine. :D
<Vordox> Nightmare Night derpy <3
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, then I'll be the first to warn cause I find it distracting and a bit annoying
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: plus like i said, in the movie sephiroth pretty much outfought him, and the movie is a part of the same canon, so hes at least as powerful
<Vivix> it is, but like- it's same for us mlp nerds, we can't take what faust or thiessen say as canon, because it's never been set into action- the best we get is heavy-hitting fanon
<Ponymon_Anarchy> :P
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: But the result was...he died
<thelonepony> im back, again :P
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: That's fine then.
<Afflict> what a badass
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: because he messed around too much, it doesnt mean hes weaker
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, and as you know me I always do thing with a spice of humour
<CrimsonPhoenix> unless I'm not in a good mood but then I shouldn't be here if I was
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Sorry, it's hard to tell humor in people's comments on the internet.
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, true that
<alexxm> wow discord as a catchable thing would be awesome
<Ponymon_Anarchy> NO
<Ponymon_Anarchy> @ Alchemist
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: So we're cool?

<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: but even if it we put all of that aside..when as cloud a God with the power to handle the entire universe? i certainly dont rememebr that

<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: I suddenly realised just how awkward it is to try typing out sound effects
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: You're catching on :P
<SpeedyBolt> Except that I love Rarity now.
<Italia> I very much dislike rartiy, because she the complete opposite of me. and thus Appleponi is favorite poni
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: in fact it cant be vaccume, the condensed water would evaporate.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rainboom, you just need to understand her multilayered character
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure
<Meanwhile> Hello everybody.
<prince-dari> Menwhirl is here
<Rainboom> Sometimes I actually worry if LPS will take over the brony fandom and steal the fame, But that might never happen in a million years, even if the world exploded (twice).
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Meanwhile.
<Italia> Hey Meanwhile
<thelonepony> Hi Meanwhile
<SpeedyBolt> dat PMV
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Holla! :)
<razzie> hello Meanwhile
<SpeedyBolt> Hi Meanwhile
<twoiloight_spurnkle> iz it can be heroes tiem?
<DeadpoolDash> Machete is getting a sequel next year
<AttackWithHugs|AFK> Hi Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Dabi pls.
<AJIsAwesome> Rainboom: LPS?
<sonicdude558> meanwhile, someone has entered the chatroom.
<DoctoDoctorWho> eavnin Saturn, how goes it with my favorite mod?
<sonicdude558> I AM SO FUNNEH
<CrimsonPhoenix> Littlest Pet Shop
<SpeedyBolt> and then, Meanwhoile got pinged to death
<Italia> >->
<Vordox> CLASSIC
<Vordox> <3
<Cypresswolf> Rainboom: Stranger things have happened
<Meanwhile> SpeedyBolt: Quite thoroughly.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai Meanwhile
<prince-dari> One of the first PMVs
<Rainboom> AJIsAwesome: The Hub apparently remade the LPS because they think that we will like anything related to MLP, but I dont really like the show.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: vaccuume is when molecules dont interact whith each other. a gas of That density would bvery much interact with each other. and it couldnt condense if it were vaccume. so its not vaccume.
<sonicdude558> :O
<sonicdude558> one of the first pmvs?
<AJIsAwesome> Rainboom: Ah, that's what you meant. I didn't know what you meant by LPS.
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: What?
<sonicdude558> When was this uploaded :P
<Vordox> Vacuum is empty space
<prince-dari> Feb 15 2011
<Rainboom> AJIsAwesome: I saw the first episode, it was okay I guess, but it's something I wouldn't watch all the time.
<sonicdude558> who
<sonicdude558> whoa
<AJIsAwesome> Rainboom: Okay. Thanks for the information. :)
<RedDragonX> you sent me an email?
<Rainboom> AJIsAwesome: No prb :)
<Italia> V_V
<Vordox> And the mass of the tanker's content had hit a floor where it started to vacuum, which causes decompression
<SpeccyRush> a pmv before pmvs
<Rainboom> prob*
<SpeedyBolt> Of course they would put RD for that a part
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vacume is empty space, end of story
<Stormy`> Lol... yes
<RedDragonX> which address did you send it too
<Vordox> And once that hit the stregnth of the outlaying material, it decompresses.
<Stormy`> the gmail one
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpeedyBolt: I cant see stream, whats happening?
<J_E_Smith71> http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/306674_494074100623550_348722759_n.jpg
<RedDragonX> haven't checked in in a bit
<sonicdude558> va cum
<SpeedyBolt> Randomness
<RedDragonX> too busy playing AC3
<Rainboom> I've like all of the ponies as my favorite time to time, until Twilight just stuck as my favorite since June :3
<prince-dari> sonicdude558: LOL SO CLEVER
<doctor_whooves127> vaccuum
<Ponies47> Hello everypony :3
<Stormy`> Oh, well it's not really important
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: :D
<RedDragonX> I'm checking now :P
<Rainboom> Haii Ponies47! :)
<thelonepony> Hi Ponies47 :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Ponies47. :)
<thelonepony> J_E_Smith71: :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> so this is every horrible songs combine?
<razzie> hello Ponies47
<DocSane> Hey
<SpeedyBolt> Hi Ponies47 :$
<Airpuff> Hai Ponies47 :)
<prince-dari> CrimsonPhoenix: Bitch please
<Stormy`> Was just asking if you were affected by the hurricane at all
<prince-dari> This is one of the first PMVs
<Italia> I prefere dashie as a lesbian more than a homophobe or straight.
<prince-dari> And it's good.
<CrimsonPhoenix> one of the first?
<RedDragonX> yes I see
<Vordox> prince-dari: Spoiled Bronies :P
<prince-dari> Yep
<Rainboom> Hmm, first pony I liked when I became a brony? It was Fluttershy by far :3
<RedDragonX> thank you for your concern
<pony_666> so what we watching?
<Stormy`> Kind of a coincidence you came back here today then lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm sorry but this isn't trouble is a friend
<RedDragonX> lol
<Ponies47> Dem pings
<thelonepony> Hi DocSane :)
<RedDragonX> it hit bad south of here
<RedDragonX> all we got is some wind
<Meanwhile> Back in my day PMV's only used show animation.
<Rainboom> Ponies47: I like pings :3
<Meanwhile> Kids these days.
<Airpuff> Ponies47 dont get spoiled now :D
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, DocSane. :)
<Meanwhile> Get off my yard.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: that doesnt make any sense. but how about this, you give me your email and i send you a pic, from my Physics textboook, where it describes Exactly what happens in that situation
<alexxm> how are things DocSane
<thelonepony> Ponies47: we're feeding you wubs :3
<DocSane> Problem with the whole "RD is gay" thing is that it's a lazy stereotype.
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Here's your nonexistant cane.
<RedDragonX> didn't even loose power which I was amazed of
<Ponies47> Wub wub wub <3
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: with the train vagon and everything
<DocSane> Going okay. Just looking in to see if anything was streaming
<Domo> oh man nostalgia video
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Why? We both have 2 ways of describing what happened
<Vordox> I say Vacuum you say...?
<Ponies47> Airpuff: Your great Ponies47 requests a drink. Jking! :p
*thelonepony glomps Domo :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> can we watch trouble is a friend? a "PMV" that only used the first two episode
<DocSane> Just finished the fifth Game of Thrones book.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> i want to play ac3 but theres no pc version yet
<Italia> is that naruto.
<sonicdude558> oh man
<Domo> -hugs thelonepony- ouo
<RedDragonX> yeah it doesn't come out for a bit yet
<Airpuff> Ponies47 wat. XD
<thelonepony> hi :3
<Ponies47> Who's streaming anyways? O.O
<Meanwhile> You totally just said that.
<sonicdude558> ok
<RedDragonX> I was impatient and got it on PS3
<AJIsAwesome> You did, Dari. :D
<Italia> Shits gettin real.
<Vordox> prince-dari: That 4 million view pony music video+
<Meanwhile> And I'm writing it down for future referance.
<Ponies47> Airpuff: Jking :P
<Rainboom> Truth is, I love Twilight, Pinkie, and Fluttershy as my favorites, but sometimes I just can't decide who should be #1. I still have Twily as my favorite, Pinkie second, and Fluttershy third.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: and how do they manage to pull off vaccuume? there were no pipes to pump out the air or anything
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/068/2/3/rainbow_dash_marine_by_ghettomole-d3b9n3g.jpg
<Airpuff> Ponies47 Didnt understand anyways o_o
<sonicdude558> prince-dari: dari Larry
<Ponies47> prince-dari: I just got here so don't judge me :P
*Italia what is heroes about anyhow?
<Derpy_Hooves> ding
<DocSane> All the characters have their strong points, but Twilight remains my fave.
<Rainboom> DocSane: /)
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: It's not pulling off vacuum, it's created due to the mass in the tanker was decompressionated
<SpeedyBolt> Sunshine Sunshine Ladybugs awake
<Meanwhile> Heroes is about a fishing boat.
*Italia makes sense
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> nov 20th
<Airpuff> This sounds so heroic...
<Rainboom> Clap your hooves and do a little shake
<DoctoDoctorWho> Italia: couldnt be a superhero show, could it?
<sonicdude558> Clap your hooves and do a little shake
<AJIsAwesome> Applejack is my favorite (obviously :P), but I like all of the other characters equally. :)
<DocSane> Oh, lord. Ain't staying to watch Heroes. I liked that show once. ONCE.
<sonicdude558> god damn it. Ranboom beat me to it.
<razzie> SpeedyBolt: one of my fav cheer
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://th04.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2011/076/4/1/fluttershy_marine_by_ghettomole-d3bu9m7.jpg
<RedDragonX> I'm on my second playthrough
<SpeedyBolt> It makes me happy everytime I hear it
*Italia just wondering, but yeah, thanks
<Meanwhile> 22.
<DeadpoolDash> what is going on now?
<Meanwhile> Yeah.
<RedDragonX> something about hacking apart a bunch of redcoats after a bad day makes me feel good inside
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: okay that sentence make sense whatsoever. mass cant decompress, its mass stays the same? and why would there be vaccume after becoming decompressed?
<Meanwhile> I remember because I WRITE THESE THINGS DOWN.
<DocSane> I saw a Tumblr dedicated to bad religious fan art. There was a disturbing amount of Pony-related religious fan art.
<sonicdude558> ldlsfjl;asdkjfl ah I have strengthened my fingers.
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: The mass can change. =P
<Airpuff> Meanwhile good someone does it. :D
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: how does the mass change in this situation?.....
<Vordox> Well, technically, not by itself, but by the space it's given.
<Rainboom> AJIsAwesome: Yeah I like AJ number 4 for a reason. She's always honest and somtimes shes just plain funny lol. I usually dont like cowgirl/cowboys with southern accents on shows, but she caught my attention.
<AJIsAwesome> Rainboom: I can understand that. :)
<Unnr> The word you want is Displacement
<Unnr> *nod nod*
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: oh god wat. the train got compressed. its mass doesnt change
<Meanwhile> Inb4 eternal cliffhanger.
<Vordox> ._.
<Domo> ugh...I ... really need to finish my homework and start on a project....-headdesk- ughhhh
<Vordox> I hate when I know what happens but I don't know the terms
<DocSane> Dammit, my illegally hosted pirate copy of the TV has been removed! HOW UNFAIR!
<AJIsAwesome> Domo: Homework > Ponies. :)
<thelonepony> Domo: YOU CAN DO IT
<Rainboom> I have perfect explainations on why I like the mane6
<Italia> >actually on 4chan as we speak, inb4's everywhere
<Vordox> The tanker's space, and the tightning of the atoms causes Vacuum to come into play inside the tanker
*AJIsAwesome waves a motivational flag for Domo
<Domo> if only you could hear my whines of conflicted thoughts
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://th00.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2011/075/9/b/rarity_marine_by_ghettomole-d3bsjfn.jpg
<Domo> But thank you ;u; -clings-
<Vordox> Once the critical point of the structure of the space limited, it causes itself to implode.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: if you dont even know what mass is, and its the same in every language, we shouldtn be talking
<Meanwhile> Success.
<Vordox> I know what mass is
<Vordox> It's Common Sense
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://th00.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2011/075/9/b/rarity_marine_by_ghettomole-d3bsjfn.jpg
<Vordox> The most powerful ability in the world
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: ...ability?
<prince-dari> Walker system
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Trust me, it is. :P
<Airpuff> ... dat ability..?
<Meanwhile> Ah yes. The Walker system.
<prince-dari> Which we found out was a little girl
<Meanwhile> And they're going to come kill her.
<Panda> dat gta4 Shizuka XD
<SpeedyBolt> Do it
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: so how did mass change then
<Panda> wait
<Panda> omg
<Panda> is that
<Panda> Domo!!!!!!!!
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Mass/Space
<Domo> Panda! -clings-
*Panda glomps Domo
<Rainboom> What is ths? sry if I sound stupid xD
<Domo> >w<!~
<Vordox> mAss itself changed it's atomical form to more tighter atom distance
<prince-dari> Shoot me pls Claire
<Yahooz> wait wut
<Panda> shizumobile is a car, no?
<Meanwhile> Oh that's right.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> ac3 is based in the civil war right?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: dude, thats middle school physics and youre wrong, mass doesnt change. its volume changed, and its density
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> hows the artwork and music?
<Vordox> ....
*Rainboom is actually batman
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/b99c5b0d-1a3f-4fc2-8816-d475dcba4167.jpg
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: actually the volume didnt even dnecessarily decrease, it only bent
<Yahooz> errr, Domo = Allegr0?
<RedDragonX> Revolutionary war
<Panda> Yahooz nope
<RedDragonX> I think Civil War is coming next though
<Yahooz> Ash?
<Panda> Domo is just pure awesomesauce on a bun ^^
<DocSane> Kill me. WAIT! Never mind.
<RedDragonX> Artwork is great, music is a little eh
<Domo> xDD~
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: I know exactly what happens
<Domo> I'm not Allegr0 :'o
<RedDragonX> not that the music isn't good but they don't blend it very well
<Vordox> atomical space and all that
<Meanwhile> Yahooz: Domo is one of these people who gets voiced but who no one actually knows.
<Vordox> It's the terms and the factors I know as wel, but I dont know the terms or fancy words.
<Yahooz> something is streaming that explains it isnt there
<Ponies47> Ohai Domo
<Airpuff> ô_o So this.. is about... heroes?.....
*Ponies47 Glomps Panda "Hi" :3
*Domo waves ouo "Hi Ponies47 ~"
<sub06905> dat Ponies47 :
<sub06905> :3
<prince-dari> Lol whoops
<prince-dari> I broked it
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: you dont even know what mass is..
<Meanwhile> Noob.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> sounds like a much different setting than previous games
<Ponies47> Dat sub06905 :3
<Airpuff> prince-dari no subs xD
<RedDragonX> Idk
<Panda> hello there Ponies47 ^^
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: mass is the atoms
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> not that i have played much assassins creed before.
<RedDragonX> I never played the first two, this is my first outing
*Rainboom has the power to go to Equestria :D
<DocSane> Anyway, I'm not in the mood for Heroes, so I'll bounce. Later, all.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: ..wat..atoms..wat
<RedDragonX> might be different on the PC though
<prince-dari> Lul
<AttackWithHugs|AFK> dari what have you done?
<prince-dari> I broke it
<Meanwhile> Dabi. Wut r u doin.
<Yahooz> stahp
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: dude i study physics for living, just trust me on this..
<Yahooz> and mfw Meanwhile resorts to dolan
<RedDragonX> all and all though it's a lot of fun
*Ponies47 Claps for prince-dari "Yeah way to go dari!"
<Meanwhile> Yahooz: Shush, that's not a thing.
<Rainboom> Yayy!
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: So you're saying the atoms are not causing the mass of the object we're talking?
<Vordox> about*
<Yahooz> Is too
<Vivix> atoms have mass, right? I haven't had physics in- ages, and even then I didn't pay much attention
<Meanwhile> Is not.
<Vordox> i thought mass was weight, which is caused by how the atoms are structured.
<Unnr> Vordox: the real question is gravatational mass or intertial mass?
<Vivix> no, mass is not weight
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: they are, but all you said is "mass is atoms" which makes no sense
<Vordox> Unnr: Gravatational of course
<twoiloight_spurnkle> and yeah, mass=/=weight
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I played a few hours of the first
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but on my old pc
<Vordox> Inerterial is movement or something
<Vivix> and that's as far as my understanding goes- but I'd trust anyone who studies thit
<twoiloight_spurnkle> or something
<Yahooz> is Tooooooo2o2oo2oo
<prince-dari> ...
<Rainboom> lolwut
<RedDragonX> I heard from fans that this one falls short of AC2 a bit
<RedDragonX> but it's still great
<twoiloight_spurnkle> lawl
<Airpuff> prince-dari.. you broke it again..
<Airpuff> xD
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Atoms exist within this space = Object, if no atoms != Vacuum
<Vordox> =P
<SpeccyRush> dabi accidentlied everything
<Meanwhile> You've created some kind of quantum distortion of brokedness.
<Rainboom> good luck with that ;d
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: so how did the vaccume create itself? the atoms just decided to leave the wagon to go home and watch tv?
<Rainboom> :D*
<RedDragonX> not like I can compare lol but I think it's a lot of fun. If it gets me to play through twice that's usually a good sign
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Tell me this, once the atoms started to tighten up to become a more solid form, what filled the empty space?
<Airpuff> *nods and folds arms* He can fix this...
<SpeedyBolt> Previously
<SpeedyBolt> everyone died
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: The answer is obvious to anyone reading that line. :P
<Meanwhile> Previously on Heroes, you saw the next five minutes of Heroes.
<SpeccyRush> previously buffer
<Meanwhile> Combo woops.
<Rainboom> Mitt Romney style is stuck in my head o_o
<SpeedyBolt> I would do a meanwhile joke, but those are Meanwhile's things.
<Airpuff> Hmpf... He's Bronystates secret weapon of mass destruction..
<SpeedyBolt> HERE LIES ROMNEY'S HOPES AND DREAMS
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: first of all youre describing what happens After the wagon god compressed. second, why would there be vaccume just because the wagon compressed? vaccume is absence of molecules, where did they go after the compression?
<Cactus> join Dashiesauce
<AJIsAwesome> :S
<Cactus> XD
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: They got filled?
<XAX> Mmmm. Toblerone.
<AttackWithHugs|AFK> Dat channel advertising
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I havent ever played campaign mode on a game twice heh
<Meanwhile> Wasn't Romney's dream to open a seafood resturant?
<Rainboom> brb guys
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: filled with what?
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: yup
<RedDragonX> lol
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: I thought that was everyone's dream.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: and why would they be filled?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: and whats getting filled??
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: By the atoms, as the limit of the space got compressed
<Meanwhile> AJIsAwesome: Maybe, seafood is good.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Airpuff> Nittany_Discord... possible oops x 3?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wouldn't count it as an advertisement personally.
<Unnr> twoiloight_spurnkle: compress something fast enough at there will be a vaccume of air due to a sudden open area that was the volume of space that is where the compressed object once was
<Vordox> Tank Space, The atom structure of something in that liquid(All 3 forms), as well as the air inside the tanker
<XAX> Meanwhile: He lost the election, so now he had to go back to his sad life of being a millionaire.
<Ponies47> Ohai Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Still talking about that train car collapsing?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hey Ponies47,.
<Vordox> Cooling = Atoms causes to become more tighter structure, getting more solid form, this happens to all atoms within the limited space.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Unnr: no but see a train wagon was being compressed due to pressure, there was nowhere for the vaccume to appea
<Meanwhile> XAX: Tragic.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol Sumica mlp game is having a "3 day sale" in the day of realese
<Ponies47> prince-dari needs to get Netflix :P
<Sumica> 00,10Preaviosly on buffer
<Vordox> And this is causes space inside the tanker to become "none filled", which causes vacuum to be created.
<Yahooz> lel
<XAX> Meanwhile: How will he go on?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You know what crushed the car.
<Vordox> Once that vacuum gets high enough pressure, causes decompression
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)
<AJIsAwesome> Night, GilDash. :)
<thelonepony> night GilDash :)
<Ponies47> Night GilDash
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: .....vaccume.cant.have.pressure.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah i know TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: vaccume has 0 pressure, thats what vaccume is
<Meanwhile> XAX: Presumably he'll blow his nose on a hundred dollar bill.
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Vacuum causes suction, which is pressure, inverted or not
<DemoPegono> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire - Part 1" airs in 1 days, 14 hours, 26 minutes, 44 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
<Airpuff> Soon
<XAX> Meanwhile: The poor thing.
<AJIsAwesome> SOON.jpg
<Airpuff> xD
<Meanwhile> I always forget how quiet dabi's stream is.
<Vivix> it doesn't technically cause it, though. and the pressure is the equivalent of whatever is outside- atmospheric pressure, etc?
<XAX> soon.tga
<DemoPegono> I CANNOT WAIT!
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: vaccume doesnt cause suction
<Ryunosuke> the thing is, when you create a vacuum in a can, or car, then the OUTSIDE air pressure is greater then the inside pressure
<Airpuff> Oh god... ._.
<Meanwhile> Quadro-woops.
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Go into space, then come back. :P
<AttackWithHugs|AFK> inb4 Nic Cage Loses His Shit
<Airpuff> C-C-Combo breaker!
<Vordox> Which is partial Vacuum
<Ryunosuke> and tanker cars are airtight iirc
<Vordox> Ryunosuke: Correct, but the outside factor is still within the math of it
<Airpuff> I like this stream. It's goofy. :D
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: ...again, vaccume doesnt cause suction. its the outside the presses in
<DemoPegono> ^
<DoctoDoctorWho> Twilight Sparkle: Thousand sons leigon. Rainbow Dash: Blood angels leigon. Applejack: Imperial fists legion. Rarity: Emperor's children legion. Fluttershy: Raven gaurd Legion. Pinkie Pie: Chaos Undivided Marines
<XAX> ._.
<DemoPegono> ... damn.
<AJIsAwesome> http://i.imgur.com/fWj6A.jpg
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: and in any case youre saying that the compression caused vaccume and the vaccume caused compression
<Vordox> I thoght vacuum was caused due to the two states of the atoms difference causes vacuum to be formed?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: what?..
<Meanwhile> DoctoDoctorWho: Twilight can't be Thousand Sons because she's loyal to Emprah Celestia.
<Airpuff> "Previously, before oops"
<Vordox> And then we go into energy, which is even more convulated
<XAX> AJIsAwesome: wat
<Dark92Enigma> PREVIOUSLY......(again)
<DemoPegono> Vacuum occurs when there is no air in a space.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: energy? hole cheddar of heaven, what???
*Nittany_Discord 11,01brings AJIsAwesome a buffer
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: Do this...please...
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Vordox> Put your palms together, air tight them, and then pull your palms from eachother
<prince-dari> This time
<prince-dari> This time...
<prince-dari> I've got this shit.
<Vordox> Congrats, you caused a vacuum. :P
<Meanwhile> You touch nothing.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Meanwhile: Magnus was loyal too, now he's a reclusive emo primarch on the planet of sorcerors
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: oh god you think thats vaccume??
<XAX> Nittany_Discord: Can I get a buffer on the rocks please?
<Phase4> ?
<Airpuff> prince-dari Good job. :P
<Meanwhile> DoctoDoctorWho: True.
<AttackWithHugs|AFK> Guys don't jinx it
*Ponies47 Pats prince-dari on the head
<SpeccyRush> inb4 it breaks
<Airpuff> ^
<DemoPegono> You get a fart noise, Vordox.
<Vordox> Yes, I think Vacuum is empty space
<Meanwhile> Dari'll sneeze and accidently close the page.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: so you think you create vaccume by pressing your palms together????
<Vordox> No
<DemoPegono> You get a fart noise.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Meanwhile: she could be the grey knights, they're loyalist and all powerful psykers
<Vordox> Not when pressing, but when expanding the space within the palm.
<Meanwhile> DoctoDoctorWho: They're also Mary Sues of the highest caliber, so yeah go for it.
<Dark92Enigma> i'm here
<Dark92Enigma> sorry
<DoctoDoctorWho> Meanwhile: Only in some regards, but otherwise it can be justified
<Dark92Enigma> but really i can't blame you
<Phase4> ??
<Dark92Enigma> just ignore me :D
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: im done. please go to wikipedia and read what vaccume is. you cant create it by using your hands...and it has ~absolute 0 temperature too..
<Domo> Guys, name me a movie/show/anything that can be tied in as a shakespearian tragedy?
<Vordox> When you pull your palms from eachother, you causes "empty space"
<Vordox> ...
<DemoPegono> Never forget that two bowls expirement.
<Vordox> What's empty space?
<Dark92Enigma> it looks you can't understand me
<Phase4> ??????????????????????
<Meanwhile> Da warudo.
<Phase4> :3
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: you dont create empty space by using your hand, theres always a bit of air there...
<prince-dari> Meanwhile.
<prince-dari> Yenius.
<SpeccyRush> dali prs
<Vordox> But tell me, what happens? =P
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: vaccuume has 0 temperature kelvin, aka absolute 0
<Phase4> Dark92Enigma, my client is set to bother me if someone talks in this room, just in case they actually have a problem :P
<Airpuff> Yeeah... "Do you fix ancient swords?!" "Yes?" "THE FATE OF THE WORLD IS IN YOUR HANDS!!"
<XAX> >kelvin
<Meanwhile> lol Airpuff.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: i alreayd said everything. im done. now go read what vaccume is please
<Dark92Enigma> Oh, that explains everything
<Dark92Enigma> thank you
<Vordox> Vacuum is space that is empty of matter.
<Vordox> The very first line on wiki
<Airpuff> Space is large. ._.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: you cant create it with your hands...
<Vordox> twoiloight_spurnkle: No, but I can simulate a fake version of it
<Vordox> Since there is no real void =P
*Meanwhile at a conveniently nearby building corner...
<Meanwhile> Also is it me or has Sylar been at the hair gel?
<Airpuff> xD
<Vordox> If you made your palms perfectly airtight, would you be able to seperate the hands?
<Airpuff> Hair gel enforces hero-puwahs
<prince-dari> Nah, it's just that his face gets sprayed with blood so often
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: he said he was done, so STFU or GTFO.
<prince-dari> He whipes it back into his hair
<Meanwhile> Hasn't he ever heard of showers?
<Airpuff> prince-dari swag
<prince-dari> Too busy killing peopel
<prince-dari> people*
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: Empty Space = Vacuum = My point
<Airpuff> Argument is invalid. You can kill people in the shower.
<Dovah> So, what are we watching?
<Meanwhile> He must smell like baked rat sprayed with compost.
<Vordox> I see nothing wrong here on my side, as the first line of wiki pretty much sums up what I said.
<prince-dari> Only if they're in a shower when you kill them
<Vordox> And he's attacking my point of it, which is in favour of Wiki
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: and I agree with that, but this has gone on too long. like ours did. its trivial now.
<prince-dari> Oh look
<prince-dari> Nathtan's wife who we've barely seen up until this point
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01George Takei is in this? Nice.
<Airpuff> Inb4 epic voice
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I forget who's speaking now.
<prince-dari> You know what Linderman's power is?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: i never denied it was empty space, but you cant. create.vaccume. with. hands. if you really want to, we'll continue this after the show in pm
<Vordox> Space, Empty Space, No space(Quantum), inverted space(Quantum); urgh ><
<Meanwhile> He can mend things.
<Meanwhile> Or heal organic things at least.
<prince-dari> <:
<Meanwhile> Hence she'll shortly be out of that chair.
<prince-dari> The real question is who put her there in the first place
<DemoPegono_> Vacuum also functions with the lungs.
<Airpuff> She's got nice wheels.
<Meanwhile> I don't like that implication dari.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> theres probably just a rat in her pants
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: i set him on fire
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Who on fire?
<Dovah> what is dis?
<prince-dari> Dat Sylar
*Vordox reads up on Wiki and sees it's agrees with me. "TIme to read."
<Meanwhile> Ted doesn't know who Sylar is yet?
<SuperPony64> hi
<prince-dari> Vordox, he's already stopped arguing with you
<Meanwhile> He's like, less up to date than otakon is.
<prince-dari> Why don't you drop it now?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vordox: omfg would you shut up already??
<FlutterMEDIC> herro my people
<Vordox> prince-dari: "All you think is wrong when it's right" <--- What would you do?

<GlyphicStrike> Nightie night
<Meanwhile> That'll do for me. Later folks.
<HoodyNinja> Airpuff: lata sucka
<thelonepony> Bye Meanwhile :)
<HoodyNinja> Anyone else want to leave?
<HoodyNinja> Anyone?
<thelonepony> que no
<GlyphicStrike> Anything else playing or is it just chat hereon?
<thelonepony> no stream atm
<twoiloight_spurnkle> but yeah, i also dont know why sylar didnt dodge that stab
<thelonepony> but you can stay with us :3
<HoodyNinja> Because Hiro is too awesome
<valoreins> in case anyone didnt see my previous link yesterday, it's my first birthday scenario game her~! :D http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/312/4/e/mlp_fim_birthday_game_fantasy_adventure_edition_by_valornomad-d5kfnpi.jpg
<valoreins> here*
<twoiloight_spurnkle> i can only assume hiro stopped time
<HoodyNinja> DAMN
<thelonepony> because Hiro's friend's power was like a Death note?
<HoodyNinja> I don't know what day I was born on
<Vordox> prince-dari: So...if Hiro died in Heroes...everything's fcked? :P
<Bronysith> death note is a boring anime after that one guy died
<Bronysith> same as Code Geass
<prince-dari> Yeah
<Dark92Enigma> i thought that too
<thelonepony> Bronysith: You mean L?
<AJIsAwesome> It's boring for you, but not for others. :)
<thelonepony> ^
<GlyphicStrike> My Situation: I'm a wizard that sails across the ocean while Braeburn is captain.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> prince-dari: so why didnt sylar dodge the stab? did hiro stop time and quickly move in?
<Bronysith> code geass and death note are the same show, except geass has mechs
<twoiloight_spurnkle> no.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> they arent
<AJIsAwesome> No it's not. :S
<Dark92Enigma> Vordox: THAT was the moment, when i stopped watching Heroes. Hiro was SO likable
<twoiloight_spurnkle> and i already explained why
<HoodyNinja> "Oh no, my favorite character is dead, I hate this show now because all the other characters are bad"
<valoreins> HoodyNinja: i know people would ignore such detail that's why i made it like that so peole would remember the day they were born :S
<valoreins> people*
<prince-dari> twoiloight_spurnkle: I'm guessing Sylar just didn't think he had it in him
<Dark92Enigma> HoodyNinja: Personally, i don't think the rest of the characters are overall bad, IT'S THE STORY
<prince-dari> He was telling Hiro to finish him earlier, but he couldn't
<twoiloight_spurnkle> prince-dari: ah, that would make some sense
<HoodyNinja> Gummy burned down my mothers village...
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: So I'm Lelouch has this almighty book that could kill anyone he wanted and Kira's world had mechs and international war?
<AJIsAwesome> *I'm guessing
<twoiloight_spurnkle> eyjey just ignore him
<twoiloight_spurnkle> i hope hes just trolling
<thelonepony> do wat sprunkls say ayejay
<Buytoast> if it's Bronysith, it isn't trolling
<HoodyNinja> I think Bronysith is trying to say that fundamentally they're the same anime
<Buytoast> it's all geniune
<HoodyNinja> But I don't see it
<twoiloight_spurnkle> indeed, they are nothing alike
<twoiloight_spurnkle> and neither are the main characters, only besides them bein smart
<twoiloight_spurnkle> but i already told him that before, so yeah
<prince-dari> MFW Buytoast isn't in the Skype group with Sith, and yet still knows him well enough to say that.
<prince-dari> Ahahahaha. XD
<Buytoast> i barely know him
<Buytoast> hell, whenever i try to talk, he calls me a /b/tard and dismisses me
<twoiloight_spurnkle> prince-dari: so you think its genuine too?
<HoodyNinja> Ha, he make joke :^D
<HoodyNinja> Why do my eyes hurt
<prince-dari> He's not trolling.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> because u saw urself in a mirror
<twoiloight_spurnkle> :>
<Bronysith> HoodyNinja: cause alucard got to them
<twoiloight_spurnkle> prince-dari: well..damn..
<HoodyNinja> twoiloight_spurnkle: No no, all my mirrors are black
<twoiloight_spurnkle> HoodyNinja: ah, thats a good idea
<HoodyNinja> twoiloight_spurnkle: Then why do my eyes hurt?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> HoodyNinja: maybe you saw a reflection somewhere else, like water
<twoiloight_spurnkle> or a window
<AJIsAwesome> Because you saw King Neptune's baldness?
<HoodyNinja> I can't afford water
<twoiloight_spurnkle> lawl
<HoodyNinja> and I don't trust windows
<twoiloight_spurnkle> "there are no stairs!"<- my friend before he tripped on stairs
<GlyphicStrike> valoreins: Mind if I share that b-day scenario pic on facebook?

<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Well, seeing how everyone thought Velma and Freddy were a possible couple I'm guessing they followed suit with Velma and Shaggy.
<VenHur> And don't get me started on Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get A Clue...

<Jmo> inc tl;dr
<Jmo> Today, the Australian Federal Government has announced that it will no longer pursue the Cleanfeed, a mandatory ISP filtering program riddled with problems and ethical concerns. It has been axed, shafted, given the boot, killed off  pick a phrase, any phrase from the broad range weve employed to describe the best course of action for this moronic idea since it appeared five years ago.
<d3rb> FUCK YES
<d3rb> CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES C'MON!
<AdamTheDuck> Oh God, I remember when they annouced that
<d3rb> ...ahem...this news pleases me.

<KandarihuFastBreak50> Jmo, that's good news
<Gold_Demona> heh
<AdamTheDuck> >.>
<Jmo> Meh never worried me.
<d3rb> jmo, were all just a bunch of convicts
<AdamTheDuck> I hate Apple so much...
<Gold_Demona> lol
<d3rb> we're**
<Jmo> Of course we are.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also I need both god mons to get the third god mon, that's some fine bullshit
<Gold_Demona> Why's that AdamTheDuck?
*AdamTheDuck goes to download the new iOs pony game
<Jmo> AdamTheDuck, are you going on about the patent?
<Jmo> oh.
<Jmo> LOl
<Jmo> Don't mention that when dema is around :<
*AdamTheDuck gets 1 gig update that will take approximately 7 hours
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: You think that's bullshit? Look up how to catch Feebas in Ruby and Sapphire. THAT is some bullshit right there.
<Jmo> 1gig?
*AdamTheDuck throws his iPhone at a brick wall
<Jmo> Should of been only 97.3MB
<AdamTheDuck> 912.7 mb.
<d3rb> lol...apple :P
<Jmo> wat.
<Jmo> lolol iOS got big ol' update for nothing
<Jmo> Android only had a small one.
<Jmo> Oh yeah Adam, first mistake, buying an Apple product.
*AdamTheDuck didn't buy it
<Jmo> wat.
<AdamTheDuck> Birthday gift...
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: they're in a few preset tiles...?! Why
<Jmo> first mistake, owning an Apple product*
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Not a few. One
<Jmo> :>
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Only one
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: And it's random
<AdamTheDuck> I would trade this in for an android -_-
*Gold_Demona owns an apple product...
<AdamTheDuck> I hate iTunes so much...
<MadSurge> For that measly Magikarp knockoff?
<Jmo> Dema, you get to own Apple cause you're cool.
*Gold_Demona feels like the only person in the world who likes iTunes...
<d3rb> i would hate apple so much less if itune was ok
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Gold_Demona> I don't get it. Why oes everybody hate iTunes?
<Gold_Demona> does*
<Jmo> lul
<d3rb> im sure its fine if youve been on apple for a while, butb i got a alot of flac's and wma's
<Jmo> I have no issues with iTunes
<Gold_Demona> I have converters that fix the flac and wma problems.
<Gold_Demona> Also iTunes has a thing now where they can convert wmas into mp3s
<d3rb> i have ALOT of music, cbf converting it
<MadSurge> d3rb: you have an animal made of music? :D
<Gold_Demona> I convert EVERYTHING I download into mp3s, just because mp3s are universal and can play just about anywhere
<Gold_Demona> And I literally have over 50 days worth of music
<d3rb> i have a house and car made of cd's and records
<d3rb> i have 114 allegedly
<d3rb> lulz
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, y u no flac
<Gold_Demona> literally. I click and dragged my base MP3 folder into an empty iTunes library and the end result was a playlist over 50 days long
<d3rb> 114 days that is
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: Because flac doesn't play in a lot of places.
<Buytoast> i hope they are all good american songs
<Gold_Demona> Only use I've found for flac is to make good cds
<Buytoast> none of that communist marx jams
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, store flac on your pc and convert to mp3 for devices
<d3rb> its all australian convict anthems
<Phase4> once its mp3 you loose quality :/
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: I don't store ANYTHING on my pc.
<d3rb> about stealin' and killin'
<Gold_Demona> And I own no devices
<Gold_Demona> none
<Buytoast> sounds MURIKAN enough to me
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, oh there are other things that make me want to drop this phone into the ocean
<DemoPegono> WHOO!
<AdamTheDuck> by the fact that I can't set my own ringtone
<AdamTheDuck> I have to "buy" one.
<AdamTheDuck> Wat.
<d3rb> wat?
<Jmo> No-one wants to ring you Adam.
<Jmo> You loner.
<d3rb> XD
<Gold_Demona> My phone is a Razr. Only use for mp3s is for ringtones, and only if they're like 10 seconds long.
<DemoPegono> I like ringtones.
<AdamTheDuck> I don't care, I just want Guile Theme as my ringtone ;~;
<Jmo> Now Adam is crying in the corner.
<d3rb> but Gold_Demona ytou have the option to change it, one step ahead of an iphone
<Jmo> So what, you call yourself just to hear your own ringtone?
<Jmo> You sad, sad person.
<Jmo> Tsk tsk Adam.
<AdamTheDuck> lol :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D the old mons' cries are so jarring
<MadSurge> "BEEP BOOP"
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: lol, Yeah, but that's because they had the original gameboy's soundcard to work with.
<DemoPegono> FREEEDOOOOM!
<AdamTheDuck> Uhh
<AdamTheDuck> So I downloaded the app, how do I transfer it to my phone? .-.
*AdamTheDuck never touches apps on his phone
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yeah, figured as much :D
<Gold_Demona> Hell if I know. I don't own a smart phone. :D
<DemoPegono> Pantech Burst. :P
<Jmo> Adam, please just put it down before you hurt yourself.
*AdamTheDuck throws iPhone at brick wall instead
<AdamTheDuck> Ehh good enough...
<Gold_Demona> If ever I do get a smart phone, I'll probably end up getting an Android of some sort
<Gold_Demona> Mostly because I don't want an iPhone that'll make me hate iTunes...
<d3rb> so mainstream, get a windows phone
<Gold_Demona> I like iTunes. I don't want to hate it
<Jmo> Feel knackered, need a few hours.
<Gold_Demona> Ewww, no Windows plz

<d3rb> its like crunk but aussie
<Gold_Demona> Stereotypes ftw!
<MadSurge> Smashing! (I know, it's british, but)
<d3rb> close enough
<Gold_Demona> lol
<MadSurge> Is there any italian stereotypical phrase apart from talking really loud and fast with an accent? :D
<MadSurge> And gesticulating wildly?
<Gold_Demona> Mama mia
<Gold_Demona> Anything Mario says :D
<MadSurge> LETSA GOOO
<Gold_Demona> Adding "a" at the end of every other word. :D

<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Colombian
<d3rb> colombia i assume
<MadSurge> Ahhh
<MadSurge> Yeah, you're all narc smugglers :D
<Gold_Demona> Not that it's a problem with me, but you NEVER want to call a hispanic by a specific country that they're not. XD
<DeadpoolDash> so, the new Mass Effect 3 DLC will have a female Turian in it.
<d3rb> smuggle it in the coffee beans :3
<Gold_Demona> DeadpoolDash: :O

<Gold_Demona> There are more episodes than can fit in 12 hours
<RainbowPie> Yeah i know
<kimplix> http://ponycraft.net/wp-content/forum-image-uploads/lord-lemons/2012/08/Rage-Challenge-Accepted-2.jpg

<RainbowPie> kimplix: Its not worth it
<kimplix> true
<Rainboom> Sometimes I dont watch spoilers, but sometimes I just jump right in them :D
<Gold_Demona> I don't care. I watch 'em. :P
<RainbowPie> Rainboom: It was good for me, When i started watching MLP and became a brony whole of season 1 and almost season 2 were out. So I got to watch them all without waiting for new episodes :)
<Gold_Demona> Watch ALL THE SPOILERS!!! [insert hyperboleandahalf pic here]
<Rainboom> Mmmystery of the Friendship Express is one of my Top 5 favorite episodes of S2 because all the references, comedy, and suspence in it. I was dying of laughter when they did Con Mane and the silent movie clip.
<Gold_Demona> lol yeah
<Gold_Demona> I was laughing at ALL of them cuz they were all such good parodies. :D
<Rainboom> Number 1 is Hurricane Fluttershy (not including A Cantberlot Wedding)
<RainbowPie> My favorite episode of season 1 has to be episode 16 "the sonic rainboom" and season 2 episode 14 :D
<Rainboom> Canterlot*
<Rainboom> Fluttershy/Pinkie episodes are my favorite by far
