<BakedMacintosh> lol southern handshake
<storydreamermlp> nice brown hat, applejack. too bad hasbro doesnt know it
<Ultra_Boom3> Flutter
<Lordshadow> I have a theory. Someone, who shall remain nameless, has had no social contact for 1000 years, and therefore, has had their social graces degrade by 1000 years. Twilight's "Lessons" are actually being passed straight to this unnamed pony. Celestia doesn't give a damn.
<Jigglysaint> who was the first pony to meet Twilgith?
<Diftraku> Green apple goes in, red apple comes out!
<M0lestia> >Pinky
