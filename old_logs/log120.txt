<Dermathil> I didn't see THAT coming
*Spin feels manly as he sharpens a pencil with a kitchen knife.
<Sketchy_Sounds> OK it's using like 100% CPU for some reason
<SirSprinkles> 6...disobeying mods = ban
<SirSprinkles> 6Just know that
<Sketchy_Sounds> Seeing if I can sort this
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't want to see it again
<prince-dari> You guys really wanted that +m
<DesertRose> what process?
<ShadTheCrazed> Nopony is right! Everypony is wrong!
<ValtheJean> that's cause it looks like you aren't a mod silver
<Crainy> ppfff
<Crainy> celestia radio is doing a reading of cupcakes
<KShrike> :(
<MPR|> oh really?
<KShrike> WHY?

<Crainy> i hate that
<KShrike> that is gross
<Crainy> left immediately
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's that time again
<MPR|> crainy: link?
<Octavia> 13Bad ponies, bad >:|
<Spin> Wasn't he dong Clopfic earlier?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 to spin the wheel of morality....I mean the lottery
<Silverscreen> 11There we go.
<prince-dari> Hey Silver.
<Crainy> how about you google ... ?
<SirSprinkles> 6lawl yay
<KShrike> That fic <Pinkie Pie>is SOOOOOO not true
<Spin> *ding **clopfics
<prince-dari> Woah.
<prince-dari> Awesome.
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, I got it, Dari.
<MPR|> but I'm lazy :UY
<Spin> *doing
<MPR|> cupcakes is an artistic masterpiece~!
<prince-dari> I haven't heard this version before.
<Silverscreen> 11FILLIES AND GENTLECOLTS! IT IS TIME FOR INTERMISSION
<Octavia> 13Dat yay
<Keyframe> Oh snap that reminds me I was going to do a comic reaction >>
<Anti-Charger> Typical.
<ValtheJean> announcement before or after lotto finishes?
<KShrike> clopfics.... why are we mentioning them in PG chat (im kidding, I know we are talking in context)
<Keyframe> to that fanfic
<Crainy> i never red it
<Silverscreen> 11which means it's time for this week's Movie And Episode Selection Lottery!
<Crainy> i dont intent to read it
<Anti-Charger> When I want this to work.
<Anti-Charger> It doesn't.
<Anti-Charger> When I'm not ready for this to work.
<Ghosties> 4WOO
<Anti-Charger> It works.
<ShadTheCrazed> I read it. It encouraged me to be a Brony.
<Anti-Charger> =___=
<ShadTheCrazed> c:
*Ghosties 4hopes he's chosen for "A" film
<Crainy> thats sad
<DesertRose> We dont talk about CupCakes here, dont even mention it in passing.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 inb4 hax :P
<ShadTheCrazed> Or at least, somewhat.
<Spin> Quite its obviously a dystopian peice expressing how the violent nature of the ponies is self destructive ( or in more direct terms cannibalism) like seriosuly it's not just hoorible gore and evil
<prince-dari> They don't call hax.
<Crainy> cupcakes spawned some great songs, though
<ShadTheCrazed> I even read it at night, went sound asleep.
<prince-dari> They called RIGGED!
<Silverscreen> 11The mods will give about a minute for each selected brony to respond, so if you decide to get up to get something or go to the bathroom, you might want to make it brief.
<CrimsonFoxx> It didn't bother me at all, gore never does...In fact, it actually made me crave sweets after I read it.
<Crainy> i give it credit for that
<prince-dari> :P
<Octavia> 13I hope I win lots of money! Oh wait... its not that kind of lottery... well that really rustles mah jimmies!
<Ghosties> 4IT'S A CONSPIRACY! >: O
<ShadTheCrazed> LIKE A BOSS
<Crainy> but the original is shit
<VioletVanilla> 6Lots of lotto in this here lottery~
<Luna> 07so hm...

<Crainy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mXff4urtlY
<Solo> Twiluna is best pony. The night will last forever.
<sklar> alright
<prince-dari> MFW I was number 11.
<prince-dari> Not bad.
<Octavia> 13lol
<VioletVanilla> 6:3
<sklar> it going to be
<Luna> 07second voice goes to Dayman
<Silverscreen> 11When did he pick last?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Changed the quality settings. How is it now?
<VioletVanilla> 6Wait but how?
<sklar> Blade runner
<Solo> Crainy: You really are a Transformers nut, aren't you?
<Crainy> kinda....
<Octavia> still skippy
<ShadTheCrazed> ... They really need to change the mold.
<Luna> 07rng
<VioletVanilla> 6BLAAADE RUNNEEEERRRR!!! :DDD
<Anti-Charger> Transformers are cool.
<prince-dari> Let's check this..
<MPR|> CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS IMMOBILE PLASTIC OBJECTS YAAAAY
<ShadTheCrazed> ._.
<Octavia> poquito
<Ghosties> 4Meeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<Silverscreen> 11rng???
<Spin> its smoother
<sklar> thats alright right?
<Crainy> not that transformers much, i just love the movies
<Octavia> 13Gah! TO THE MOOOOOOOOONNNNNNAAAAA with you!
<CrimsonFoxx> I'm a Sonic nut to be honest.
<Keyframe> So... what rule is the one where there's a gender opposite?
<Luna> 07random number generator :P
<FourCartridge> Mario
<ValtheJean> I don't see Dayman on the list
<Ghosties> 4He picked Se7en a couple months ago
<prince-dari> Looks like a definite A to me.
<ShadTheCrazed> Spin: Needs to look more like FiM though.
<Anti-Charger> I'm a Naruto nut myself.
<Octavia> 13Its your choice, dude. :)
<Ghosties> 4That's why I have an idea in place
<Solo> CrimsonFoxx: I think most bronies like sonic, judging by the fanart I've seen
<Luna> 07pcZuelo
<Silverscreen> 11ah, so it wasn't recent then.
<Keyframe> I'm a pony nut
<VioletVanilla> 6Octavia is not happy~ lolol
<FourCartridge> everypony is.
<CrimsonFoxx> Rule 63, keyframe
<Solo> I think that's rule 63.
<Spin> KeyFrame: Really? GTFO
<Octavia> 13lol I'm fine. Just pickin. :P
<Silverscreen> 11Blade Runner is totally an A movie.
<prince-dari> Ok
<Anti-Charger> Not into Sonic all that much, but Dash and Sonic make a cool duo.
<sklar> octivia whats wrong with my choice?
<ValtheJean> we good?
<Ghosties> 4Recent in my eyes
<ValtheJean> with sklar that is
<Spin> Pony Nonsense
<Luna> 07yep
<prince-dari> Nothing.
<VioletVanilla> 6iamokaywiththis.jpg
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Luna> 07got it noted down
<Mason_Trowel> Hmm, I think the CMC would be better with the plastic non-brushable hair. You can't really achieve the appearance of their hair in the show with the synthetic brushable hair.
<Solo> Dash and Sonic are the same person, basically. :P
<Octavia> 13I'm not a fan myself, but its not my choice. :P
<Keyframe> K, I found someone on youtube that does voice acting for the mane six.
<Solo> Dash is very close to being a sonic expy.
<Anti-Charger> lol.
<CrimsonFoxx> I found another Pony pairing I bet nobody thought of: Tails and Fluttershy.
<Mason_Trowel> Also APPLBLOOM HAS NO RIBBON! What the hay?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 don't see Dayman anywhere
<Luna> 07our second winner is PCZuelo
<Mason_Trowel> *Applebloom
<Solo> And, Anti-Charger, Naruto is also popular in this fandom I notice. Mason and I are both fans.
<prince-dari> Must have left then.
<^Stargazer> oh god, CMC toys spoted
<Anti-Charger> Awesome
<^Stargazer> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/new-cmc-toys-spotted.html#comments
*Solo wants to be a vice actor.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the b choice is yours PCzuelo
<Anti-Charger> Good to have some Narutards here as well
<Solo> It's like a stunt double, except I do the drinking and smoking.
<^Stargazer> and Charilee as well
<Luna> 07PcZuelo please tell us the B movie you would like to watch us
<Anti-Charger> So I began a countdown until season 2
<roushguy> I'm slightly less bored than I was before
<Luna> 07with us*
<roushguy> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 7d:11h:26m:29s
<Anti-Charger> I've drawn 4 days so far
<roushguy> !s3
<DerpyBot> I need 1.21 gigamuffins to find that out for you.
<PCzuelo> Uh
<Octavia> 13>watch us
<Anti-Charger> Fluttershy be next.
<Luna> 07I fixed!
<Luna> 07>:
<Octavia> 13Doing what?! D: lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the movie.....IT'S WATCHING ME
<Anti-Charger> And she actually came out surprisingly awesome.
<Mason_Trowel> I'm not so much a Narutard as I am a disenchanted fan from the olden days of Part 1, continuing to read the manga for closure.
<Anti-Charger> Now
<prince-dari> Octavia: Oho! ;)
<Luna> 07oh u!
<Octavia> 13Movieception!
<Anti-Charger> Eh
<VioletVanilla> 6PLEEEAAASE PLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASSSSEEEE
<Anti-Charger> I love all naruto
<PCzuelo> I'm new around here :-)
<Anti-Charger> I'm taking my leave for a bit now
<Mason_Trowel> Although there are some aspects of the latest stuff I enjoy.
<Anti-Charger> Going to go stock up on Lego Minifigures.
<prince-dari> You've got the choice of a 'B' movie.
<Anti-Charger> The latest stuff is great.
<Mason_Trowel> Later, Anti-Charger
<Octavia> 13Well, what B movie would you like to see? :)
<Luna> 07Ah.. well you were picked in our lottery.. and you get to pick the B movie
<Anti-Charger> bye bye for now.
<prince-dari> So low budget or generally sort of 'so bad it's funny' movie.
<Solo> Mason: Ironically, I didn't like Part 1 that much. But I watch the anime, primarily
<ValtheJean> 2,14 or cult film
<Silverscreen> 11Or cult films.
<Spin> That movie trailer
<Octavia> 13Cult classic, low budbet, that stuff.
<Shaico> Who said Naruto
<Octavia> 13*budget
<Shaico> How dare they mention Naruto.
<Mason_Trowel> I'm getting no sound, Sketchy
<CrimsonFoxx> I prefer One Piece myself
<Solo> Shaico: Several of us.
<Spin> No audio :(
<prince-dari> MFW bjornfort is number 4.
<ValtheJean> inb4 bjorn bitches again
<^Stargazer> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<^Stargazer> yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps ^Stargazer
<^Stargazer> D
<^Stargazer> =D
<Dudeguy> Naruto is alright, I've only seen part 1 so far but hopefully rhe angst will dial down in part 2
<prince-dari> Please don't let PcZuelo decide to give up their choice.
<prince-dari> XD
<Octavia> 13Lmao
<Mason_Trowel> I honestly don't care much for One Piece.
<ValtheJean> lol
<Luna> 07*headbangs*
<Mason_Trowel> And, Dudeguy, that'
*VioletVanilla is on her haunches~
<ValtheJean> please let PcZuelo surrender the choice to me :P
<Solo> Dudeguy: The angst zigzags in part 2.

<Mason_Trowel> Sounds working now, Sketchy.
<Ghosties> 4Amazing choice
<prince-dari> Trololo
<Solo> Shaico: I'm very sorry our discussion has upset you so much. But please try to understand, it's not like we were deliberately trying to anger you or anything.
<Octavia> 13DAT TROLLING
*Shaico yawns. "Hi Octy."
<prince-dari> U mad viewers?
<Ghosties> 4No prob from me, Bjornfot
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I love it
<CrimsonFoxx> Yeah, I like the humor in one piece too, though I mainly like that at times the characters feel emotions so strongly that it feels a lot more believable, and the fact that it has some of the most unique powers I've seen in any anime.
<Shaico> Solo relax dude. xD
<Octavia> 13Y U DO DIS YO US?!
<Ghosties> 4You know
<prince-dari> Anyone got anything else to say?
<Luna> 07Alright

<ValtheJean> 2,14 John Madden?
<Silverscreen> 11eeenope.
<Mason_Trowel> Stream is also going more smoothly, Sketchy.
<Luna> 07Ponies or Blade runner
<Ghosties> 4I have to believe that Bjornfot did that for the marathon
<Ghosties> 4He's such a trooper
<Octavia> 13To quote Zecora: You're doomed.
*Octavia is disapoint
<Silverscreen> 11NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<prince-dari> I don't care why he did it, I love him for it.
<Octavia> it seems stable, Sketchy_Sounds
<Mason_Trowel> Gonna have to speak up, though. Can't hear you very well. Sounds like you're mumbling.
<Octavia> 13Dat singing voice.
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Luna> 07and Blade runner will be our first movie
<Ghosties> 4Calm down, dude :P

<Uno> The entire movie isn't talking lips, right?
<ProffesorKritzKrieg> musicals arent really my cup of tea
<SuperBrony64> Who's Tim Curry?
<Kencolt> Those who are virgins to this movie-- be afraid. Be VERY afraid.

<KShrike|Reading_OTEOTM> Ok, I may be semi-afk
<Uno> WELL OKAY THEN
<Solo> KShrike: You play Nox?
<Rainbow_Dash> 11The only time I remember saying anything about in the Mane chat is just mentioning "Bunker", usually to get herospirits attention
<SirSprinkles> 6The #bunker thing is really annoying... -_-;
<KShrike|Reading_OTEOTM> No...
<FreezeFrame> Brent Spiner had a ton of fun with Data, too.
<Razyn> 0Damn brad is tall
<Magenta> 13Dat perfect body
<Retsamoreh_Craftin> There are so many sexy updates in 1.8

<KShrike|Reading_OTEOTM> Nox, the creater of Minecraft
<Dr_Frank_N_Furter> 11I think Hitler would be proud.
<Darf14> Hey the tank is filled with rainbows! That's why it works
<Rainbow_Dash> 11As for how news about it got to BronyStateMods
*AlphaOmega tries to imagine a Dalek Brony
<ValtheJean> but, my policy is thus:
<Lordlyhour> Its the type of game I could really get into, but I've played game I like more and are cheaper
<RAWRity> I MADE HIM FOR ME.
<Solo> KShrike: God damnit.
<PNP_9588> :)
<E_N> 7I mean, when you talk just pm hero
<Mason_Trowel> *Notch
<Elky> shh
<Mason_Trowel> His name is Notch
<TheLotusTeaDragon> SUDDENLY... GODWIN.
<KShrike|Reading_OTEOTM> Whoops
<R-Zack> What?
<Alterego> Cavestory for instance.
<Reaver21> Hitler would be proud, had he not turned Hipster.
<ValtheJean> so long as their craziness stays out of the main chat (my jurisdiction) let them do what they want
<KShrike|Reading_OTEOTM> Now I feel stupid
<KShrike|Reading_OTEOTM> :S
<Dermathil> ANOTHER SONG
<Sol> Dr_Frank_N_Furter: lol XD
<everrfreenights> WHAT A GIFT
<Mason_Trowel> http://notch.tumblr.com/
<Janet> 07of course!
<mib_dn768b> dat reference
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> guffaw guffaw
<MentallyUnstableBanana> Nox is a cheese wheel designed to rule Antarctica by 1500 BC in my mentally unstable mind. Now, why are you reading this? You're wasting your time. Seriously. Stop reading my mentally unstable ramblings.
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Eh, Okay. Herospirit, make sure you dont miss it when I do PM you
<Solo> KShrike: Nox is one of my favorite games.
<RAWRity> it's been like, 40 seconds since the last song. Calm the fuck down movie.
<R-Zack> Weights?
<herospirit> I'll try to remember
<Darf14> Every time a song starts take a shot
<Sol> This is a musical. What do you expect by this point?
<SuperBrony64> Where's the stream schedule list? I can't find it on the site.
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Lol
<EspyLacopa> this movie loves the music.
<Reaver21> Dat sugar!

<Elky> STROOOOONG MAN
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Anyway, sorry for threatening your mod Prince-Dari, this whole thing is kinda about making less than serious things very serious
<mib_689twc> STRONNNG MAN!
<everrfreenights> DOCTOR FOR PINKIE PIE?
<Solo> No. Nox is an isometric action-game. It's vaguely similar to diablo in terms of layout, but it isn't an RPG.
<interior_gummy> STROOOOOOONNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGG MAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNN
<RAWRity> sol more than 20 seconds between songs. Just amke it an opera at this point.
<Dr_Frank_N_Furter> 11Agreed.
<Reaver21> This movie will NEVER cease to be amazing!
<Mason_Trowel> Sorry, Alterego, I don't get the reference.
<Rainbow_Dash> 11And I wasnt really sure if he could force himself upon us or not anyway.
<Ghosties> 4What is #bunker?
<Dr_Frank_N_Furter> 11Just annoyed that I caught shit for doing my job.

<EspyLacopa> RAWRity: Imagine this as a broadway musical.
<a041744> A MAAAAAAAaaaahaaaaanaanaan
<everrfreenights> THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME
<Solo> It's a straight-up action game. You can do stuff like, for instance, see a wizard shoot a fireball at you and cast a spell to swap-location with him
<[NLR]Molestia> I'M GONNA MAKE A MAN
<[NLR]Molestia> OUT OF YOUUUU
<ValtheJean> it's the place they go to bitch about certain mods
<Solo> forcing him to eat his own fireball and die.
<[NLR]Molestia> wait
<Sol> Trust me, it calms down later
<MentallyUnstableBanana> I can't stand Isometric games. Then again, I barely play any games.
<KanyeNorthEast> work that vault
<Kencolt> Hero-- you're not really MEANT to.

<Uno> Then suddenly, saxophone.
<mib_dn768b> this causes me saxgasm
<AniDragon> First time I saw this movie was on New Year's, at about 3am, while on alcahol and energy drinks. If you think it makes no sense on a normal day, just imagine that for a minute.
<Magenta> 13Lovely party~
<Ghosties> All we ask is that you not advertise on our main chat
<herospirit> Okay, so who are the bikers?
<Ghosties> That's all
<MentallyUnstableBanana> Challenge accepted.
<FreezeFrame> Nope, Sweet Transvestite is the best.
<Efreet> I was playing Age of Mythology when I started Neopets
<ValtheJean> good choice Luna, good choice ;)
<RAWRity> so why are these bikers here? kicks?
<MentallyUnstableBanana> Rule 34 must live.

<MentallyUnstableBanana> TO THE GIMP MOBILE!
<mib_dn768b> shits and giggles

<prince-dari> That's why I said.

<herospirit> We already put him on trial.
<ForteCanter> the professy will help!
<shadowLurker> oh, noes, candles, my only weaknes
<Alterego> Well, you do the same act over and over again, you lose the joy because it becomes your job.
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Ingenuity!

<mib_dn768b> LOLOLOLOL
<ShadTheCrazed> ^
<Pizzicato> why do you being mentally unstable is something to gloat about?
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Of course not, we just cant tell just anyone about this stuff however. =/
<Janet> 07*rage*
<herospirit> What about Ponychan? What does that have to do with this? I'm missing something
<R-Zack> ._.
<everrfreenights> rocky's turning one year old so help us celabrate!
<shadowLurker> wait, Eddie was the biker?
<Trouble> I ganked that pun. No shame!
<Uno> And then rape
<RAWRity> WHEN I SAID I WANTED HIM INSIDE ME, I DIDN'T MEAN THIS.
<SanityIsNotForBananas]> I am influenced by FiM. It's helped me TONS.
<a041744> NOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooAAAAAAAAAAAHNHHhh!!
<Reaver21> I'd RAGEQUIT life..
<Pizzicato> why do you think*
<Sol> Columbia no le gusta
<Ghosties> But if you actually are trying to "crush the soul of one of my fellow mods" then it's best that I don't remain here
<MrEvergreen> Pony-related or not, it does influence us to strive for better things, it seems.
<KanyeNorthEast> eddie was the biker, yeah
<Aponymous> How long is this?
<Thunder_Dash> The meatloaf will be delicious, the festivities first-rate!
<everrfreenights> the cake will be delicious, the festivities first rate
<Alterego> Solo: Ehhh... I was a pretty happy guy, but no way was I tolerate. I honestly think FIM help change that a little.
<shadowLurker> Oh... fuck
<a041744> WHAT A TWIST
<Elky> Doctor VON Scott!
<Mason_Trowel> ...It isn't exactly something to be proud of when say you are VIOLENTALLY unstable.
<R-Zack> Rage.
<Reaver21> HE'LL ALWAYS BE A PART OF YOU, EVEN IF IT'S ONLY IN YOUR COLON
<Dee> I'm now more outging cus of ponies
<Dark_Horst> didn√Ñt that movie have jonny depp in there?
<PCzuelo> again
<SuperBrony64> The cake is nonexistent, the festivities first rate!
<Ghosties> I don't want to catch any shit with the others
<Mason_Trowel> *Violently
<SanityIsNotForBananas]> The mentally unstable ones are always the ones who are nefarious. Hence my persona, NefariousBanana.
<Mason_Trowel> Blegh
<Magenta> 13Trouble
<Pizzicato> Is there some sort of pissing contest where people are self diagnosing themselves with mental disorders again, 'cause I guess it's cool to have a mental disorder?
<thegreatandpowerfulpattap> taker another shot
<Trouble> me!
<a041744> Eddie was born unlucky
<ValtheJean> I'm so glad there's so much effort put to annoy me *sarcasm*
<Elky> in his mutter's side
<Magenta> 13Haha ^
<Solo> MrEvergreen: I have to agree to that. But the primary way I see it changing people is that it is helping them open up. Be emotionally open instead of cold and closed all the time.
<everrfreenights> THERE WILL BE SCIENCE AND DANCING, BOB FOR APPLES, CUT A UUG
<Pizzicato> When really mental disorders ruin peoples lives and make them miserable?
<everrfreenights> rug*
<Pizzicato> Real cool, bro.
<MrEvergreen> @Solo: I have no answer to that. But one thing for sure, Lauren Faust seems to be a realistic and reasonable feminist.
<Rainbow_Dash> 11I see, and we dont know how your "Fellow mod" is going to react
<SanityIsNotForBananas]> Pinkie Pie has given me a very effective way to not be bullied.
<sotha> Okay I'm back.
<Sol> Whistler's Mother ftw
<RAWRity> why is this guy singing?
<SanityIsNotForBananas]> My life is tons better.
<Magenta> 13Dat singing
<a041744> SON, I AM DISSAPOINT
<TheLotusTeaDragon> A dirge! A dirge!
<herospirit> Oh he'll be fine.
<Reaver21> Got dat SWAG
<Sol> MONSTER MASH
<DuskShine> ... wait, what's wrong with ponychan?
<Alterego> I love this moment. Everyone here is having an indepth convosaiton... bout ponies.
<Darf14> *snot no 5*
<Magenta> 13Dat dancing
<mib_dn768b> this movie is not going to keep me sober with all it's music
<RainBow_Derp> and the numbers keep falling
<Bufurd> what
<[NLR]Molestia> WAIT A SEC
<shadowLurker> dat dancin
<Magenta> 13En a motanike!
<Ghosties> I *hate* how Ponychan operates
<prince-dari> :P
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Meatloaf had good taste, rip
<[NLR]Molestia> ARE THEY EATING EDDIE??
<DesertRose> Im pretty sure 80% of the world population could be diagnosed with a mental disorder, seeing as there are so many
<Sol> Yup
<RainBow_Derp> yes
<Rainbow_Dash> 11I dont know how to use Ponychan
<Kencolt> Yesd, he IS rocking 0out in a wheelchair.
<Alterego> Except for SINFB, he is mentally unstable.
<Razyn> 0The Rock n Roll life
<Filter> Your right, needs more ponies
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Its confusing to me
<a041744> Not liking your teddie makes you a killer
<Ghosties> I hate it's completely cultish community, and it's circle-jerkish hierarchy
<prince-dari> I'll make it up to you afterwards. ;)
<Darf14> ok, no more shots, I am feeling off
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Got a little shoulder action going!
<Solo> Alterego: Happens all the time.
<Mason_Trowel> I agree, Pizzicato. This is hardly flattering, and rather insulting.
<Magenta> 13Un I did!
<Sol> There's a little MeatLoaf in all of us
*VioletVanilla hugs Val~
<DuskShine> ...
<herospirit> He'll be ultimately trolled, but he will only be pissed for 2 weeks max.
<VioletVanilla> 6ohbby~
<Razyn> 0^
<DuskShine> I get the feeling you don't actually go to ponychan, ghosties.
<Elky> somesing
<RAWRity> please stop singing magenta.
<RainBow_Derp> sigh
<Ghosties> I do, DuskShine
<Trouble> Columbia is Eddie's Scootaloo
<SodapopFizz> Wait.. I don't like my teddie but.. I like my pony. Am I still a killer?
<Vanin> so bout them ponies....
<Ghosties> I've been around on Ponychan for months
<Magenta> 13<3
<Ghosties> Since early May
<Mason_Trowel> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 7d:09h:50m:53s
*Magenta 13is such a great singer
<ValtheJean> Oh I can't wait Dari. What could you possibly have planned for me? Perhaps an entire folder of pictures?
<SanityIsNotForBananas]> I'm joking about my mild schizophrenia, people. Geez. Calm yo flank down.
<MrEvergreen> Faust does not come off to me as an extremist of any sort.
<DuskShine> As have I.
<everrfreenights> TOO BAD, HE IS DEAD
<Mason_Trowel> A week...
<Trouble> Magenta is the low sultry sounding one for teh record
<CriticKitty> xD
<Alterego> Vanin: They are everywhere!
<Mason_Trowel> Just one week.
<Sol> AGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<TheLotusTeaDragon> How many A's in AAAAAAAGH!
<Alterego> Even right behind you....
<Elky> und i did
<a041744> I Guess edie wrote that scream in the note
<MrEvergreen> Which is mostly an ingrained view towards feminism.
<Solo> MrEvergreen: Yeah. She seems to be a very level-headed person.
<Synros> unt I did
<Ghosties> So that means you're one of them if you see absolutely nothing wrong with the pedestals they put other people on
<prince-dari> I actually meant something good.
<Bufurd> unt i did
<prince-dari> But whatever.
<Pizzicato> She's awesome.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 It's in the castle of....ugggghhhhhhh
<Vanin> aww no there not got my hopes up and everything
<Ghosties> And please
<lordpie> ...
<Darf14> No not the teddy bear!
<Magenta> 13Und I did~
<a041744> mfw you way UNT, where im at
<Sol> Hey hey hey!
<MrEvergreen> And that's a good thing to have such a person giving us the influence.
<Ghosties> Spare me from the tired diatribe on "Oh, but they're great people"
<Sol> IT's FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT ALBERT
<Alterego> Sorry Vanin.
<R-Zack> Its fat albert
<Lily> hi
<SanityIsNotForBananas]> I actually HAVE mild schizophrenia, I'm just making some crap jokes about it. That's what I meant.
<Bufurd> mod is right und i did
<ValtheJean> well, I would appreciate it if it were true :P
<Ghosties> I've heard it plenty
<a041744> O:
<R-Zack> Aww you beat me
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Dishes are done!
<Janet> 07AAAAARCH!
<Sol> Ohai
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> KICK OVER THAT TABLE
<DuskShine> Right.
<[NLR]Molestia> :O
<Mason_Trowel> Agreed, Evergreen.
<SuperBrony64> Oh shit
<mib_dn768b> oh man
<Elky> WHAT A TWEEST
<Magenta> 13AHHHHHHY
<ValtheJean> but experience has taught me to be ever the skeptic
<KanyeNorthEast> fun fact: only tim curry knew who was under the table
<Alterego> Hey Lily!
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Sent you a PM herospirit
<Darf14> Cool table Decoration
<DuskShine> That's a very good argument, ghosties.
<MrEvergreen> Most of us stick too hard on the extremes, either too individualist, or too collectivist.
<Reaver21> SO REALISTIC.
<DuskShine> If I may present a rebuttal?
<SuperBrony64> There's the birthday cake!
<R-Zack> Slap fight.
<Alterego> join in on the conversation! We got muffins!
<a041744> Best funeral ever
<Reaver21> I do like that table though!
<DuskShine> Go fuck yourself with a cactus.
<everrfreenights> CHASE SCENE
<Ghosties> I don't care
<DesertRose> when someone says "mental disorder" people only think of those with the most severely affecting ones, like aspurgers/autism ect
<Lily> muffins!
<TheLotusTeaDragon> SURPRIZE FUNERAL!
<^Stargazer> next week I'm totally watching the entire season 1 while on vacation
<Elky> I always forget about this song
<Sol> Dat Scooby-Doo chase
<TGPFluttershy> SHUT UP
<RAWRity> IS FRANK GONNA HAVE TO MUSICALLY SLAP A BITCH
<Ghosties> HAHAHA
*Magenta 13laughs manically
<R-Zack> ha! Shut Up!
<mib_dn768b> EVERYONE RUN IN CIRCLES SCREAMING
<Ghosties> That's rich
<MrEvergreen> If you want optimal results, it's better to strive for a healthy balance.
<SuperBrony64> Apple Pie!
<Mason_Trowel> *Asperger's
<Dr_Frank_N_Furter> 11*headbutt*
<Sol> Wise up, Janet Weiss
<Bon_Bon> muffins... urrrghhh *retch*
<Ghosties> You're cute
<Alterego> Agreed Evergreen. Magic and Science can coexist! Really, Im referring to twilight and Pinkie pie.
<herospirit> I didn't get it Rainbow
<Bufurd> apple friters
<Solo> MrEvergreen: The big problem is that we think of things in terms of "individualist", "Collectivist", etc., these labels make people polarize themselves.
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Only struggle between verses!
<Reaver21> Ballsy of her!
<DesertRose> sry
<General_Hazard> Und I did
<Mason_Trowel> It's no biggie
<MrEvergreen> Which is really hard to achieve, however, one should always remember that.
<DesertRose> can never spell that right
<herospirit> And please stop with the rage you two.
<Tovler> She needs to straighten up and fly right
<Bufurd> apple crumpets
<Kencolt> Okay. Not biting anyone in this flick. Too weird.
<mib_dn768b> wait...this is another shot isn't it?
<DuskShine> I ain't ragin', mate.
<Bufurd> apple cakes
*GrimGallop rings a bell
<Tovler> Apple Shrimp
<General_Hazard> Oh! I get it! You're part eggplant! HA! XD LOL ROFL

<SuperBrony64> EVEN HER RUN IST SO GRACESHFULL
<Mason_Trowel> I don't think I really think in those terms.
<MrEvergreen> Labels are not the driving force of polarization.
<Darf14> ugh...must..resist..shot....*phew*
<everrfreenights> MY VEELS
<RAWRity> TAKE OFF THE SHOES.
<RainBow_Derp> @ KanyeNorthEast I find that fact hard to beleve as most of the cast was in the BROADWAY version too
<Solo> Mason: Good.
<SanityIsNotForBananas]> *sigh*
<Elky> I can't move my WHEELS!
<MrEvergreen> It's the intentions.
<Ghosties> Did I say you were?
<Synros> great SCOTT
<mib_dn768b> my vheels!
<Sol> And you're a cantalope!
<Solo> MrEvergreen: Chicken or egg paradox there.
<Reaver21> Sklar, the fuck?
<SanityIsNotForBananas]> *yawn*
<a041744> YOU FOOOLLS!
<Darf14> F***** Magnets! How do they work!!
<Reaver21> lol
<Bufurd> take off shoes?
<ShadTheCrazed> Mom doesn't really see why it's so interesting yet, then again she's hardly watching it.
<PCzuelo> I can't move my hooves.
<Sol> A MENTAL MINDFUCK
<ShadTheCrazed> :|
<whizz_bang> why is the twist in horror musicals always "it was already scary and paranormal but now its aliens lol"?
<MrEvergreen> Well, not really chicken or egg.
<DuskShine> Was I talkin' to you?
<Sumica> sound waves dont work that way
<SanityIsNotForBananas]> What I'm saying right now is lying.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> STOP WITH THE SCIENCE
<a041744> Dumb Earth People
<Filter> why is there a ] at the end of your name, bananas?
<RAWRity> MENTAL MINDFUCK, AS IF THERE IS ANY OTHER KIND.
<sklar> 9kILL ME NOOOOOWWWWWW OR OR WELL FUCK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU ACTUALLYYY LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVVVEEE FUCK YUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Nittany_Tiger> That transducer.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 enough sklar
<Tovler> dat sonic screwdriver
<R-Zack> What?
<interior_gummy> THE TIMEWARP
<Solo> MrEvergreen: Labels rose from people trying to categorize people. Labels also make people try to categorize themselves and others. It's a sort of cycle.
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Heh... solid matter.
<Aponymous> What?
<SuperBrony64> Looks like someone went insane lol
<everrfreenights> SPAAACE
<SanityIsNotForBananas]> Why not?
<KanyeNorthEast> hm, maybe. I'd just read it as a bit of trivia that they wanted to get a shocked reaction
<Ghosties> Oh, I wasn't even paying attention to herospirit's part. Oh well
<Synros> Sklar a mod?
<Rainbow_Dash> 11...
<Alterego> Filter: He is mentally unstable, don't quesiton him.
<MrEvergreen> You just have to consider both benefits and appropriateness.
<ValtheJean> nope
<DesertRose> from what i know theres hundreds of variations of Aspergers, diferent forms of Dyslexia and so forth
<[NLR]Molestia> WE CAN SEND CHOCOLATE BARS THROUGH TV
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Schmanet!
<Dark_Horst> he german?
<PrincessCelestia> a planet of ponies!
<herospirit> :[
<Reaver21> Wise up!
<Kencolt> Echoes?
<Solo> MrEvergreen: You see the same thing with tropes. First a work legitimately builds a trope.. but then it gets labelled, and future works try to fit it
<RAWRity> I WAS RIGHT ABOUT INTERPLANET JANET
<Ghosties> I'm sorry : (
<Synros> ok
<Darf14> SPAAAACCCEEEEE!
<SanityIsNotForBananas]> Bracket is wha- Whoops. No need for me to get banned today.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Is Germany a planet?
<TheLotusTeaDragon> SUDDENLY WATUSSI.
<Ghosties> To herospirit, that is
<Janet> 07stoooooooop

<mib_dn768b> lol
<Vanin> so we all talking about brain problems eh
<a041744> DAT TEMPO CHANGE
<Sol> Dat organ
<MrEvergreen> No doubt, but do remember, Tropes Are Not Bad.
<DesertRose> nah
<DesertRose> just finished
<Rainbow_Dash> 11I dont like your attitude Ghosties, you seem to be rather quick to judge people
<Sumica> what the hell was the writer of this on.
<interior_gummy> shoobie doo
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Teh Shaking Fists!
<Sol> MEDUSA
<R-Zack> Lol Medusa
<Kencolt> Okay. I got nothing.
<Reaver21> lolz

<mib_dn768b> ME DUSA
<DuskShine> Very quick.
<Magenta> 13And then everyone was statues
<Sumica> ...
<SanityIsNotForBananas]> OK. I don't want people complaining over mental conditions, so I'm gonna do this for ya.
<Ghosties> You don't go to Ponychan, if I'm correct
<RAWRity> whatthefuck.jpg
<SuperBrony64> Uggh‚Ä¶I'm hungry‚Ä¶I could go for some of Applejack's Apple Fritters right now...
<SanityIsNotForBananas]> !moon
<Keyframe> I hate coloring fire!
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, SanityIsNotForBananas]!
<Sol> lol
<Reaver21> lolwut
<SanityIsNotForBananas]> BYE
<shadowLurker> lol
<R-Zack> Your a hotdog?
<sotha> No. Don't blink. Don't oh . . .
<Sol> STATUE MACHINE
<mib_dn768b> FOREVER A STONE
<DesertRose> btw, Egg came before the chicken. If your follow evolution
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Stone bewbies!
<Janet> 07magic!
<Solo> MrEvergreen: Indeed. But it does end up building more polarized and stereotypical works. If used correctly, however, Tropes are tools.
<Nittany_Tiger> Zappity zap zapperton.
<Darf14> Now they are stoned
<MrEvergreen> There's no such thing as true originality, it's mostly based on something previously demonstrated.
<Rainbow_Dash> 11I read over it sometimes
<Magenta> 13Da magic!
<Vanin> got any brain problems just watch pony ya will fix ya right up >_>
<Alterego> Oh noes! Friendship!
<Sumica> squeeky rage
<Rainbow_Dash> 11It doesnt make sense to me honestly
<Elky> I hate you so much I wrote a song about you!
<KShrike|Reading_OTEOTM> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 7d:09h:46m:25s
<TheLotusTeaDragon> You know what stoned is backwards? Denots. It's important.
<Thunder_Dash> Don't blink - Don't even blink! Blink, and you're dead. Don't turn your back, don't look away, and DON'T. BLINK. Good luck.
<KShrike|Reading_OTEOTM> :(
<SuperBrony64> That statue has dangly parts on it
<MrEvergreen> Indeed, and as you can see, it's still the intentions behind what's at hand here.
<R-Zack> Seems like they are..
<everrfreenights> SHTONE
<NefariousBanana> I be back, homehs
<Rainbow_Dash> 11But, I seriously doubt that everyone there is as bad as you say
<Sol> Nice bush
<ShadTheCrazed> About a week now!
<Solo> MrEvergreen: Likewise, labels themselves can be helpful for defining an individual and helping them undersatnd themselves..... but they can also make people divisive.
<R-Zack> (Puts on sunglasses)
<Kencolt> And now it's "The Dyas of OUr Lives."
<R-Zack> Stoned.
<shadowLurker> stoned
<DesertRose> 1 week :O
<R-Zack> YEAAAAAAH!
<PrincessCelestia> lol
<Trouble> BEWBS!
<VioletVanilla> 6This movie. . . Why have I not watched it sooner? XD
<TheLotusTeaDragon> STONE VEELS!
<Sol> MEDUSA
<Magenta> 13Concrete boobs
<Nightshade> ha ha! dangly parts!
<mib_dn768b> oh man
<Tovler> INTO STOOOOOOOOOONNNNAAAAA
<Rainbow_Dash> 11There will always be annoying people, but there will always be great people.
<MrEvergreen> Are you striving to make a novelty, or just to seek quick fame for a buck?
<NefariousBanana> Oh crap. 1 week?!
<KShrike|Reading_OTEOTM> That's 7d:09h:46m:25s
<General_Hazard> XD Why is Rocky all posed
<KShrike|Reading_OTEOTM> too many
<Synros> lol "missing frame"
<a041744> SCREW THE 4TH WALL!
<Janet> 07seriously Violet?
<everrfreenights> COCKATRICE
<PrincessCelestia> looks like they got stoned!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Darf14> Dang it, would he stop stoning people
<herospirit> I I guess it would be best if I stayed completely out of this argument.
<Reaver21> Who want to **** some hard stones!
<Janet> 07first time?
<RAWRity> whatwhatwhatwhatwhat.jpg
<GrimGallop> What.
<ShadTheCrazed> ^
<Ghosties> You don't see the internet detective bullshit some of the mods have played, how !!Spike mod used to have favorites which is nothing more than just a symptom of the intense hierarchy of "important" persons on there. And I'm not saying EVERYONE is bad, there are some good people, believe me, but the majority of the users there are just sooooooo hiveminded
<Alterego> Its actually about eight days for me. I need to wait for it on youtube angry face!
<Magenta> 13Yeah, poor VV. Missing it all this time :P
<KShrike|Reading_OTEOTM> <AppleBloom> But, I WANT IT NOW!!!!
<Sol> Popping the RHPS cherry?
<NefariousBanana> I still have 9 episodes to watch until the new season.
<KShrike|Reading_OTEOTM> Lol
<Trouble> They're all "rock hard" right now.
<a041744> Magenta, please STFU
<Vanin> im going to be on a flight all day on the 17th ><
<DesertRose> Im going to watch the live stream
<Trouble> Puns!
<KShrike|Reading_OTEOTM> Watch them, Nefarious!
<DesertRose> i cannot contain the pony
<DuskShine> In other words, some of the folks there did some bad things.
<TGPFluttershy> It seems that Rocky has got....stoned. YEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
<PrincessCelestia> the moon!
<Ghosties> You can't be nice and reason with them, and you can't scream and yell at them
<VioletVanilla> 6Oh no no, I have seen this before XD;
<MetalGearSamus> That's...at 5 am my time. Perfect. I can wake up to ponies on YT.
<R-Zack> Don't take that for granite!
<Janet> 07ohhh!
<Janet> 07I was worried
<NefariousBanana> I can't watch them.
<DuskShine> So Ponychan is now a wretched hive of scum and villainy.
<TGPFluttershy> Hmmm....That was probably bad.
<GrimGallop> *First-timer*
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Lots and lots of nothing!
<MrEvergreen> @Solo: And yes, as you stated, labels themselves are not the culprit.
<VioletVanilla> 6Just should have been watching it like. . . twenty times again before this!
<Ghosties> I've accepted that Ponychan just will not change its ways
<SuperBrony64> RANDOM FLOOR SHOW TIME!
<Sol> Magenta looks eerily sexy in this scene
<Trouble> Oh ROCKY!
<NefariousBanana> I have no earbuds at the moment...
<MrEvergreen> It's the intentions, yet again.
<TheLotusTeaDragon> I've seen it a number of times, but this is the first time watching it with others.
<TGPFluttershy> 6th timer.
<MrEvergreen> And also, experience.
<Thunder_Dash> Do we get to do the time warp again later?
<a041744> hehe, just as planned
<Trouble> You better wise up Granite Weiss!
<KanyeNorthEast> elbow sex, elbow sex, elbow sex!
<Ghosties> Bad?
<RAWRity> and then they danced because why
<R-Zack> The End?
<Ghosties> No, no
<Trouble> *Janet
<mib_dn768b> dem statues
<TheLotusTeaDragon> lol@Trouble.
<Sol> ELBOW SEX IS BEST SEX
<MrEvergreen> Ignorance is one thing, manipulation is something else.
<Rainbow_Dash> 11The entirety of the internet is a wretched hive of scum and villainy
<Magenta> 13Ahh, I thought this was your first time too VV :P
<Solo> MrEvergreen: It's not about finding a culprit. This isn't about blame. Labels themselves DO exacerbate the problem to some extent. Of course, we can't do away with them - but we can try to teach people their role in thinking.
<Ghosties> And what RD said is true
<Alterego> Yes, one is intentional, one isn't.
<SuperBrony64> Sol Hoof Sex?
<Rainbow_Dash> 11There are more malevolent people than benevolent
<Ghosties> Yes
<NefariousBanana> What are you 2 fighting about?
<PinkPartyPony> Hey guys! I was wondering if any Bronies wanted to hang out with me?
<RAWRity> and then we just stay on a shot of the statues for 30 minutes.
<everrfreenights> so when do they stop being stone
<Darken_Skye> how much longer is this movie?
<Sol> Why not Croup Sex?
<a041744> >Narration, chat stops
<KanyeNorthEast> not that much more
<[NLR]Molestia> this is my first time D:
<Keyframe> uh.... sure?
<MrEvergreen> Ah, I'm sorry. It's not really about blaming any side involved that I want to talk about.
<Kencolt> Why does he even ask?
<FoxM> where do you live
<Sumica> Thank you exposision man
<VioletVanilla> 6Heheheh~ It feels like it Magenta <3
<Darken_Skye> good I can watch the end
<Alterego> Are we invitied to a party cuz you think we're really swell?
<Tovler> in a van down by the river
<DesertRose> One of my friends has moderately severe dyslexia, makes fun of himself most of the time because of it
<Rainbow_Dash> 11But, judging an entire site based on what some of these "Malevolent" people just seems kinda wrong
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Basil Exposition. :D

<NefariousBanana> I gotta go, my friends.

<mib_dn768b> brad T_T
<Elky> Applejack would switch off after five minutes
<Thunder_Dash> "Help me mommy!" Yeah, that's what I was thinking!
<ShadTheCrazed> With the occasional sigh.

<Trouble> SEXY!
<MrEvergreen> Mental health is not a thing to joke about, that's for sure.
<SodapopFizz> SPike would be asking Twilight what's going on and Twilight would say 'I don't know, none of my books say anyhting about this.'
<PrincessCelestia> rid*
<FreezeFrame> Heels aren't as hard as you might think.
<Synros> lol im glad Im watchign this alone
<Razyn> 0SuperBrony64 De-Medusa
<Quill> creepy...
<Solo> ShadTheCrazed: The first two episodes are not a good way to introduce someone to the show.
<PinkPartyPony> Noo.
<Sol> I like Brad's Falsetto a lot
<TGPFluttershy> Down to 115 viewers
<Ghosties> I think that most of the users on Ponychan have completely entrenched their lives in "love and tolerance," like it's a cureall for EVERYTHING, and it's not.
<PinkPartyPony> Stupid Ads!
<Sol> >114
<SuperBrony64> Oh haha
<Razyn> 0 114
<ShadTheCrazed> Solo: Hmm...
<Darf14> Cant tell if its a Man or a Women
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Yeah, the falsetto was good. LOL
<DuskShine> Oh for fuck's sake.
<Sol> ninja'd
<Solo> PinkPartyPony: Whoa. Spam.
<RAWRity> Pinkie Pie would be the only pony capable of making sense of this.
<Magenta> 13 /msg nickserv Valthejean then password I think
<KanyeNorthEast> can't believe people are leaving just as its ending
<a041744> I'm watching this iand my roommate just doesn't care
<Solo> ShadTheCrazed: Does she like Looney Tunes?
<GrimGallop> Fluttershy's innocence has been corrupted :(
<DuskShine> That's a goddamn joke, Ghosties.
<ShadTheCrazed> Well, I'll just explain that to her when she says she didn't like it.
<PinkPartyPony> No spam
<Alterego> Solo: Which episode is good to introduce someone?
<Magenta> 13Just gotta identify your name I think.
<MrEvergreen> @Solo: The problem with the first 2 eps is that they are very Magical Girl-ish.
<ShadTheCrazed> Solo: Yeah.
<Elky> Pinkie Pie would be an actor in the movie
<DuskShine> It's how they deal with fucking trolls.
<Ghosties> Joke???
<PinkPartyPony> Song
<SuperBrony64> This would be an average movie on Pinkie Pie's list
<MirthTinker> good thing she's afk
<Magenta> 13Unless theres a ghost in the chat still.
<R-Zack> NorthEast, people just don't like the old, unusual movie.
<Ghosties> Boy, now THAT made me laugh
<Ghosties> Joke...
<Ghosties> sure
<TGPFluttershy> Pinkie Pie would be the Dr.
<Solo> ShadTheCrazed: Show her A Bird In the Hoof
<Solo> ShadTheCrazed: or Party of One
<Reaver21> THE BEAUTY.
<MrEvergreen> I'm not sure Magical Girl theme is a way to target a general audience.
<Vanin> i think it depends on the person solo the first to can be a good starting point it was for me
<KanyeNorthEast> wait a minute, rko? I thought this was 20th century fox. Shit now i'm confused. we need to start the movie over
<DuskShine> They treat them like the jokes they are.
<RAWRity> grimfallop Fluttershy would have passed out by now
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Yeah, you have to take this movie with the knowledge that it is nuts.
<Alterego> Party of One was the best.
<Caramel> hmmm...that wasn't it
<Kencolt> I... I STILL can't find anything to bite. It would just be playing into their paws.
<R-Zack> Nah, the one with the high voice.
<Magenta> 13Dont see one though.
<mib_dn768b> and then there was magic
<Thunder_Dash> Does that mean they'd be eating cupcakes instead of meatloaf?
<Janet> 07will do!
<everrfreenights> this movie would make pinkie proud
<MrEvergreen> Unless you thrive on high/heroic fantasy.
<[NLR]Molestia> I nominate WarGames for next movie.
<a041744> Fluttershy would be Janet
<Ghosties> Treat who?
<ShadTheCrazed> Solo: No worries, I know what I'm doing.
<Bufurd> crack snorts this movie to get high
<Sol> Yeah, we probably should have explained that before
<RAWRity> WHERE HAVE ALL THE HEROES GONE?
<mib_dn768b> Seconding WarGames
<PrincessCelestia> this movie will be one of pinkie's favorite
<DuskShine> >Ghosties can't read, apparently.
<Fluttershy> ._. my innocence....
<Sol> WHERE ARE ALL THE GODS
<Trouble> Pinkie Pie! The Demon baker of Fleet Street!
<MrEvergreen> Lol, show her the insanity.
<Solo> The first two episodes were there to establish that it's an adventure series.
<SuperBrony64> I nominate The Wizard as the next B-Movie
<Rainbow_Dash> 11*facehoof*
<Alterego> I think you need to see the first two, and I think that is a flaw.
<Magenta> 13Should work. :/
<Janet> 07hah Flutter
<Elky> I dunno, I think Twilight would fit Janet more...
<TGPFluttershy> Shall.We.Play.A.Game?
<Solo> The rest of the first season was there to build up the inter-personal friendships of the main characters.
<Fluttershy> ;_;
<a041744> Trouble, NOOO IT MAKES TOO MUCH SENSE!!
<MrEvergreen> Show her that this show did not tone down on personal rejection.
<Sol> I nominate Stand and Deliver as B movie
<Trouble> Labyrinth! We need Bowie!
<GrimGallop> I nominate Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter.
<Quill> no
<Dr_Frank_N_Furter> 11NO DISCUSSION OF CUPCAKES
*Razyn 0likes this verse
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Oh God Trouble, we need to watch that some time
<Solo> the first two episodes, I find, are poorly received by many first-timers.
<sotha> SuperBrony64: Not Wizards!
<Tovler> I nominate Bubba Ho Tep
<Ghosties> You know, instead of trying to insult me, you could actually tell me who you're referring to
<R-Zack> Pony Jesus.
<Alterego> Because I watched an episode towards the end of the season, and I was so lost on terms of charries.
<Rainbowdasheroo> Hey.
<Trouble> YES!! We must!
<SuperBrony64> WHAT?! WHY NOT?!
<Janet> 07Oh yes David Bowie
<Vegnar> I support Bowie based movies
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Why are we arguing about Ponychan anyway.. Who gives a shit?
<Mason_Trowel> I'm getting an Error 404 message when I try to go to the Bronyville Livestream...
<herospirit> the trolls I believe
<RAWRity> I nominate either "Plan 9 From Outer SPace" "Birdemic" or "Nudist Colony of the Dead" for the next B Movie
<mib_dn768b> what.a.strange.game.the.only.winning.move.is.not.to.play
<Kencolt> I STILL say Plan Nine. If ONLY as a cleansing rinse.
<Sol> WE MUST
<TGPFluttershy> Tovler, That was my B movie pick!
<GrimGallop> Oooo! David Bowie!
<[NLR]Molestia> DID HE DEAD
<KanyeNorthEast> bowie is almost as awesome as tim curry
<Reaver21> Raptor Jesus is best Jesus.
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Yeah, Bubba Ho-Tep would be right in line with this film.
<Alterego> Im speaking of before I watched episode one and two.
<Caramel> ung, I'll just relog
<Ghosties> Are you insinuating that the trolls are the ones that "love and tolerate" TO THE MAX?
<FoxM> Party of One was pradictable
<DuskShine> Or you could, y'know, read what I said instead of being an idiot and asking me to repeat myself.
<a041744> SYMBOLIZISM!!
<Sol> Didn't we show Plan 9?
<SuperBrony64> Greatest Video Game Commercial of all time >_<
<Bufurd> what
<FreezeFrame> RAWRity: MLP movie has already been picked
<Solo> Every episode is predictable.
<Mason_Trowel> Wait, I fixed it.
*Janet is sad the ride is almost over
<ColeTrain4EVER> What is this?
<Trouble> Nope. Pool orgy time!
<DuskShine> >Ghosties can't read.
<Reaver21> Plan Nine from Outer Space, yall..
<Sol> Or was that Killer Klowns?
<Ghosties> I'm just asking a question
<sotha> I nominate Radioland Murders.
<FreezeFrame> For FiM Season 1 marathon weekend.
<Ghosties> No need to get mad, bro
<Kencolt> Plan 9 is FOREVER.
<KanyeNorthEast> 2nd to last song
<PrincessCelestia> wheres the fim movir starring tim curry?
<FreezeFrame> Killer Klowns is AWESOME
<DuskShine> Ain't even mad.
<General_Hazard> This ending makes me sad for Frank-N-Furter whenever I watch it
<Ghosties> Who are the trolls on Ponychan?
<Ghosties> Clarify
<RainBow_Derp> ahaha SS titanic
<RAWRity> freezeframe I know, that's just what I say we should do the week after
<Vanin> i think its just that no matter what you show em kus of preconceptions they will not like the first ep or 2 they see
<Reaver21> dat makeup!
<Solo> MLP: FiM does not have particularly advanced, convoluted or unusual plotlines. It's mostly a character-driven series.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> The Black Gestapo would be an interesting pick too
<DuskShine> I think you're being pointlessly silly.
<ValtheJean> ung
<Tovler> Is Slither an A or B movie?
<[NLR]Molestia> wait
<Ghosties> I want your definition
<ValtheJean> mfw it still doesn't remember I'm a mod >.<
<General_Hazard> B Movie
<Alterego> Solo: Not a Bird in the Hoof. That took some knowledge, but yeah every episode was predictable, but for some reason, I still enjoyed the conclusion.
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Wait
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Ghosties
<R-Zack> o_o
<RainBow_Derp> the ending is amazing!
<MrEvergreen> No doubt, the rest of season 1 is mostly slice-of-life.
<[NLR]Molestia> dr died?
<a041744> Fun Fact: THe set had no heater so all the actors got sick after filming this scene in the cold water
<Nightshade> killer klown from outer space, attack of the killer tomatoes, tremors and little shop of horrors (the one with the giant talking plant) we need those moveis!
<Solo> Altergo: It's about the journey :P
<DrActivisionary> WATER ORGY TIEM!
<Alterego> Also, A dog and Pony show was not predictable either.
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Why do you give a shit about what people do on Ponychan?
<DuskShine> Anyways, this is retarded.
<Bufurd> orgy in the pool?
<DesertRose> if every episode is predictable then your too damn smart to be watching this show......drat that applies to everyone who isnt an 8 year old girl
<herospirit> Keep it civil Dush
<Trouble> If we don't pick Labyrinth, then we need Braindead for that lawn mower scene!
<MrEvergreen> Slice of Life style does attract general audiences.
<ColeTrain4EVER> WTF?
<mib_dn768b> lol
<herospirit> Dusk*
<Sol> Well, there's also I'm going home and if this the original ending version, Superheroes and Science Fiction Double Feature (Reprise)
<everrfreenights> WOOHOO, THE DOCTOR IS IN
<Solo> Alterego: You didn't find Dog and Pony to be fairly predictable?
<Kencolt> There's always Tremors 2, with one of the greatest lines ever...
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Stow it, Wheels!
<Nittany_Tiger> Gay meter over 9000.
<Ghosties> Because I actually care
<Alterego> Solo: Ok. Agreed.
<Ghosties> For some unknown reason
<DuskShine> He doesn't.
<Magenta> 13Pool orgy time!
<Ghosties> That I've yet to figure out
<VioletVanilla> 6It is okay Val, it does not let me change my nick for fun like Luna or Octavia did :3
<ShadTheCrazed> Well, mind that MLP:FiM is actually a show for all genders, just aimed at a younger audience.
<RAWRity> I was also contemplating choosing "Five Across The Eyes" in order to torture you all with one of the worst movie viewing experiences ever.
<Sol> IT'S OK TO BE GAY
<Quill> reallky
<Ghosties> That's cool, label me bro
<herospirit> Ghosties, he's saying "love and tolerence" is a joke they use to counter trolls
<a041744> My mind was gone a loooong time ago
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Hm, but would arguing solve whatever problems you see in Ponychan?
<Sol> YES
<RAWRity> but that'd kill the buzz
<Elky> wait, there's a version without Super Heroes?
<R-Zack> WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUU
<TheLotusTeaDragon> w00t! Heels and Wheels!
<Magenta> 13Hmm...
<SuperBrony64> So‚Ä¶What's the moral of this story? What would Twilight write to Princess Celestia about this movie?
<Reaver21> :creepygusta:
<interior_gummy> we already watched tomatoes
<a041744> O GAWD WAT
<Ghosties> No
<Sol> GO DOCTOR GO
<Magenta> 13Oh wait.
<everrfreenights> HE CAN WALK, ITS A MIRACLE
<Filter|Makin> whoops
<Ghosties> I learned that long ago
<mib_dn768b> OH MY GOD
<ShadTheCrazed> Which means it ends up being for all ages.
<Alterego> Solo: No, not really. Or not at the begining, like most episodes. Once Rarity began to whine, it became clear.
<Darf14> Oh no! He has been infected!
<MrEvergreen> HHmm...
<Ghosties> I tried that and it doesn't work
<Trouble> Gay meter over 9000? We're full grown men who enjoy watching colorful ponies.....
<Nittany_Tiger> I'd rather be straight TYVM.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Tim Curry doesn't find crippled old men attractive
<Tovler> =.= I desensitized
<R-Zack> I think I just saw crack in movie form.
<Kencolt> And we have SEVERELY WRONG SIGN.
<SirSprinkles> 6 /cycle #bronystate
<a041744> SEX cures paralysis
<Nightshade> IT BEGINS!
<PrincessCelestia> one of the weirdest movies ive seen
<Rainbow_Dash> 11So why are we arguing now. =/
<Vegnar> He likes his leg alot
<Magenta> 13Yeah, try that.
<DesertRose> I find every TV show rather predictable, most scenes im looking at i can guess whats going to happen in the next 10 seconds
<Ghosties> That's why I said being nice and reasonable doesn't cut it on there, neither does yelling or screaming at them
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Arent we just wasting time and energy?
<Nittany_Tiger> Watching ponies isn't gay.
<RAWRity> because statues
<FreezeFrame> Joker Curry
<Janet> 07did you love it PrincessCelestia?
<MrEvergreen> Well, I had a thought but it might not be applied, so scratch that. xD
<ValtheJean> oh there we go
<Ghosties> Yeah, we are
<Magenta> 13I had to do it twice before it would give me OP.
<ValtheJean> ty sprinkles
<Dermathil> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Janet> 07I know I did!
<Nittany_Tiger> It's manly.
<Trouble> Neither is tis.
*^Stargazer eats himself some delicious apple pie
<DuskShine> As far as I'm concerned, the only thing I'm here for right now is the movie.
<Ghosties> But DuskShine fines it in his heart to continue trying to berate me
<Ghosties> *finds
<^Stargazer> <3 Pie
<Solo> Alterego: Yeah. I was fairly sure Rarity would find a way to take them over, though. the show has a sense of humor like that, and it's the easiest way, in that episode, to avoid a violent conclusion. and they always avoid violence in FiM for conclusions. Except NMM.
<Magenta> 13Not like I didnt try to help. lol
<Trouble> That;s the point
<PrincessCelestia> just because tim curry is a great actor!
<Leika> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/a61d876a2846e96e2ba4a3d10aef4077/55444%20-%20artist:theartrix%20humanized%20left4dead%20parody.jpg I would play this game.
<R-Zack> How is he doing that?
<a041744> I Love it, BUT WHY?
<FoxM> I liked the first two episodes up until the ened
<Sumica> Oh PrincessCelestia is here, my we are popular now.
<mib_dn768b> oh doctor, you so silly
<Solo> NMM got the business end of the orbital friendship cannon.
<ValtheJean> and you too octavia :P
<ValtheJean> I wub woo
<R-Zack> Yes, indeed.
<Rainbow_Dash> 11DuskShine, you know you came to see me to. =P

<Magenta> 13Nup, you hate me. :'(

<ValtheJean> D:
<Sol> Plot? What plot?
<Janet> 07You should watch again
<RAWRity> this proves that Dr. Scott was just being lazy
<SirSprinkles> 6There's a plot to this movie?
<ValtheJean> nuuuuuuuuuu
<Elky> what plot?

<ArcticVanguard> I just joined in... what am I looking at?
<Thunder_Dash> This movie has a plot?
<R-Zack> There is a plot here?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> What are you talking about? This movie has a lot of plot
<herospirit> goooooooood whyyyyyyyyyyyy
<everrfreenights> THE DOCTOR IS IN COGNETO, GO WHEELCHAIR MAN, GO
<TheLotusTeaDragon> The only plot that exists in this movie is the one under the table.

<SuperBrony64> Okay, let's watch more Ponies after this!
<MirthTinker> ArcticVanguard beats me, and I've been here the whole time

<Tovler> weird al voice?
<Darf14> ET go home
<a041744> DAT MOHAWK
<R-Zack> Celestia, tell Luna I said Hi! :)
<Ghosties> And if he's saying "love and tolerance" is used to counter trolls, then he would be right if this was when Arctic Tempest introduced FiM to /co/. He would be somewhat right now. But the majority of people on there "love and tolerate" each other a lot
<Magenta> 13Dem outfits
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Gold LaMalians!
<Trouble> Magenta and Riff Raff! Remember them?
<Sol> I thought you turned into Violet
<DesertRose> I like to think that the Friendship cannon is not a voilent or destructive
<everrfreenights> BACK UP, SCIENCE IS ABOUT TO GO DOWN
<ShadTheCrazed> Crap, now she's a bit concerned.
<Ghosties> Hence, pedestals coming into play
<DrActivisionary> o rly?
<mib_dn768b> SEX
<Mason_Trowel> I like that it could be considered a subtle (or not so subtle) reference to Gen 1's Rainbow Of Light.

<Ghosties> No, I am
<Ghosties> If you want me to?
<DuskShine> You're right, they should just treat each other like shit instead of decent human beings.
*DuskShine agrees wholeheartedly with Ghosties.
<DrActivisionary> sad song time...
<General_Hazard> Here it comes :C
<Elky> I think Magenta is my favourite character in the whole movie
<MrEvergreen> Well, the magical power of Friendship here is the influential power it has that can convert oppositions.
<a041744> What is mona lisa doing here?
<mib_dn768b> cum again?
<Synros> <TheLotusTeaDragon>: PenisTrident
<FoxM> it wouldnt be called friendship cannon was destructive
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Teh sads. :(
<RAWRity> this movie stopped being fun after "Sweet Transvestite" ended IMHO
<Ghosties> They should treat each other like human beings, not like sheep
<DrActivisionary> =(
<Sol> Hey, mods, does this have the original ending? Or is it the happier ending?
<Magenta> 13Elky <3
<Kencolt> Ohhh-kaaaay. Explain with another musical number. Somehow, that works.
<MrEvergreen> Which, ironically funny, is what Lauren Faust has been doing all along.
<PrincessCelestia> hope we see more luna and celestia plot in seasno 2.
<DesertRose> I would like to know more about the Friendship cannon....mabie we will get more explinations in S2
<ArcticVanguard> This IS the Sweet Transvestite movie!
*Magenta 13yawns
<Magenta> 13So boring
<ShadTheCrazed> Alterego: "Uhh... I'll admit, I am a little bit concerned at what you're seeing.
<Sol> lol, she'd bored
<Alterego> Wait. Why are we calling it a cannon?
<Bon_Bon> its friendship
<R-Zack> You want to see your own plot more often?
<ShadTheCrazed> -her words
<Elky> heh
<Ghosties> But I'm done, since this really is getting nowhere and I'm arguing with someone over the net
<Sol> DOS EYES
<everrfreenights> WELL I KNOW WHERE YOU AIN'T GETTING BLUE SKIES! CUZ YOUR GOIN, ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<Reaver21> To SWEET HOME ALABAMA!
<a041744> Imagine spot?
<DesertRose> because of that meme
<DuskShine> They do treat each other like human beings.
<Vanin> jokes?
<TheLotusTeaDragon> THIS CAN ONLY END WELL.
<Bufurd> where idd people come from?
<Ghosties> Sure
<DuskShine> You'd know this if you actually went there.
<Nittany_Tiger> Suddenly, audience.
<Sol> Ohai Audience
<RAWRity> suddenly audience
<Ghosties> I believe that you believe that
<DesertRose> "Hate Detected, Firing Orbital Frienship Cannon"
<Sumica> the hel
<PrincessCelestia> its majic
<Alterego> It was more of a spell.
<ArcticVanguard> I think I'm gonna mute this and go listen to "Dentist"
<Reaver21> Audience? ohai.
<Tovler> suddely 114
<Vanin> ^
<Mason_Trowel> I always refer to it as the Rainbow of Light, but the Orbital Friendship Cannon is the meme.
<Kencolt> Instant Audienhce. 1.99 a can!
<sotha> BEEEEEEEEYYYYIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITCH
<Alterego> Ahhh. I get it.
<MrEvergreen> Friendship Cannon...Sounds like a WMD that Celestia has in her arsenal.
<PrincessCelestia> magic*
<Ghosties> You can believe that I don't actually go there all you want
<RAWRity> nittany_tiger MIVEHIND
<Darf14> He is so good at singing a big audience appears in 10 seconds flat
<Ghosties> Keep thinking it
<Sol> This is where things would get very meta in the stage version
<Vanin> just a net joke ya
<DuskShine> I frequent /pony/, /g/, browse /meta/ and /dis/.
<a041744> sumica, saying that through the whole movie
<Elky> but it's almost over arctic
<KanyeNorthEast> this is where you're suppose to throw cards at at the screen
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> My Little Rocky Horror Picture Show: Transvestites are Magic
*GrimGallop plays 52 pick-up
<DuskShine> I know what it's like on ponychan.
<Solo> alterego, it comes from a still-frame of Rainbow Dash doing the Sonic Rainboom
<Ghosties> And?
<PrincessCelestia> and I could make fluttershy plot bigger than anypony.
<mib_dn768b> Rockey Horror Picture Show: Musicals are MAgic
<Alterego> But wasn't the picture a rainboom?
<RainBow_Derp> guys you relies this is not a comedy right?
<a041744> You people are so predictable
<Solo> tht looks like some kind of orbital satellite firing an angry pegasus at you.
<everrfreenights> I call it the rocky horror pinkie pie show
<DuskShine> You clearly don't.
<DannySwish> MEMEE

<DesertRose> but not as long as "Orbital Friendship Cannon"
<Ghosties> So what, you go to a board that keeps pumping out the same tired questions, a board that's slow that only gets traffic, mostly, from the TF2 steam community, Hipster and Cross Breeze constantly trying to figure out WHICH ONE POSTED FIRST, LOL, and then on /dis/ where that old Religion thread created by Whelp is still being exacerbated
<ReticentSmolder> so...you guys still upset about Across the Universe? lololol

<a041744> Awesome effects
<Solo> Acronyms. they are your friend.

<DesertRose> Friendship Beam!
<a041744> Uuuuuuuuughghghggh

<Synros> antimatter doesn't kill him, but falling 20 feet into water....
<Rainbow_Dash> 11It would be less of a headache if I just banned both of you, but DuskShine is my friend, and it would be unfair if I just banned you, Ghosties
<Whimsical> Dangit computer! (This is Alumonius)
<MrEvergreen> The problem is, Friendship without Love might fail to lead to Unity.

<TheLotusTeaDragon> Now with 11 seconds of new footage!
<Elky> SuperBrony: Watch a Let's Play
<Alterego> Meh. I would argue that Twilight Sparkle loves her friends though. And its not true friendship unless you care for them...
<herospirit> SuperBrony64: DO NOT PLAY LUNA GAME
<MrEvergreen> But really though, cliche as it seems, this is not something to joke about.
<a041744> TIME WARP!!!!!
<Thunder_Dash> LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN
<Alterego> Maybe it is not love, but care?
<TheLotusTeaDragon> LET'S DO THE TIMEWARP AGAIN!
<everrfreenights> TIME WARP
<Magenta> 13LETS DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN!
<Dermathil> IME WARP AGAIN!
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<Reaver21> YESS
<R-Zack> Do not play Luna game.

<Dermathil> TIME WARP AGAIN!!!
<Kencolt> Well, Plan 8 didn't work. Now for-- aw you know.
<TGPFluttershy> RAINBOW
<Dermathil> WITH RAINBOW
<RAWRity> HURRAY, SECOND BEST SONG GETS A REPRISE
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> The power of friendship!
<mib_dn768b> PREPARE FOR LIFTOFF
<SuperBrony64> Of course it's a space ship‚Ä¶
<MrEvergreen> Care does work.
<Alterego> And why did my mind jump immediately to Care Bears? -facehoof-
<lordpie> 1
<Solo> Love is often defined as the level of connection at which someones wellbeing matters to you as much as your own.
<DuskShine> /pony/ isn't really the place for that either.
<everrfreenights> AND THEN THE CASTLE WAS A SPACESHIP
<Sol> Original Ending: got?
<MrEvergreen> No doubt about that.
<Reaver21> The SPACE castle!
<Trouble> Rainboom
<GrimGallop> I'm also curious about this Luna game.
<[NLR]Molestia> DEM SPECIAL EFFECTS
<PrincessCelestia> rocket to the moon!
<TheLotusTeaDragon> DOUBLE RAINBOW?! WHAT DOES IT MEAN!?
<RAWRity> WHERE'S MY ROCKETSHIP CASTLE?
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Herospirit, are you still there?
<Ghosties> So it may happen now, it may. But I mostly lurk these day...not much for me to say on there, honestly
<Aponymous> WHAT
<R-Zack> The game closes by itself sometimes then automatically opens up at a random moment to scare you.
<herospirit> Yah
<Solo> I think Twilight's level of concern for her friends qualifies.
<Elky> lol they just shift a picture of the castle upwards...
<Trouble> DAT BE A RAINBOOM
<Mason_Trowel> Care-Mare Staaaaaare!
<Darf14> It was a sonic Rainboom that destroyed the Castle!
<Kencolt> THIS I have not seen.
<FoxM> :D
<R-Zack> Or you oen it up again.
<Thunder_Dash> Wait, who's this?
<Sol> Original Ending: GOT! FUCK YES!!!!
<Reaver21> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEEEEEEEEEEEee
<Nightshade> they go now to party with luna!
<SuperBrony64> ALL THE WAY TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
<MrEvergreen> Well, I think Love is more than that.
<TyeDyeBrony> DOUBLE RAINBOW
<R-Zack> open*
<Ghosties> Yeah, I know /pony/ isn't the place for it
<Mason_Trowel> Btw, somepony needs to make Care-Mares
<Alterego> This is the ultimate show down mason?
<Ghosties> But it just kinda happened
<DesertRose> Kindness, Loyalty, Generosity, Honesty and Laughter
<herospirit> I'm here
<DuskShine> /meta/, sure. Not sure why you'd still think the way you do if you posted there, though.
<a041744> Im bleeeeeeeeeeding
<RainBow_Derp> best song.
<Solo> MrEvergreen: Then it's time to argue semantics... which gets us nowhere.
<Elky> great ending song
<Ghosties> I didn't start a thread about my complaints. Derails and all that
<DesertRose> best kind of freinship has those 5
<Magenta> 13Dat fog
<Solo> MrEvergreen: I think we should change topics.
<Alterego> That's Harmony though Desert.
<Trot_Rot> lol care-mare
<RAWRity> WHERE ARE ALL THE SUPERHEROES
<VioletVanilla> 6Dat FROG
<Trouble> Sounds like Frank ruptured something
<DesertRose> FFFRRREINDDSHIP
<Synros> dat poison cloud
<TheLotusTeaDragon> SEXEH CRAWLING
<Trot_Rot> ugh, that doesn;t look good, changing
<DuskShine> *shrug* Derails are just the way of things on /pony/ until Season 2 rolls around.
<Trouble> LOL bleeding inside
<TGPFluttershy> Who chose this movie?
<everrfreenights> AND SO THE CASTLE WENT IN TO SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<Bufurd> dat fag
<Janet> 07<<<
<Trouble> Horrible dark pun?
<FoxM> care mare DO NOT WANT
<Janet> 07me
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that would be our streamer
<VioletVanilla> 6Janet~
<PrincessCelestia> Maybe I should change my name to discord
<Darf14> even when they are dying they can still sing, these guys are like cockroaches!
<Sol> Cut songs because of stupid reasons are always best (cuagh, Little Shop of Horrors, I'm looking at you)
<AlphaOmega> Mason_Trowel: Mind a quick PM?
<Reaver21> everfreenights, :slowpoke:
*TGPFluttershy brohoofs Janet so hard the universe implodes
<SuperBrony64> Wow, I wonder whose brilliant mind came up with the plot for this movie...
<RainBow_Derp> actually the last song to be made for the movie the 14 hour days show in this number
<TheLotusTeaDragon> WHEELS!
<Ghosties> No, no, I mean that I mentioned my complaints when the thread derailed into discussions on the community or whatever
<Ghosties> I'm fine with derails
<Razyn> 0ohai Luna
<KanyeNorthEast> it was riff raff
<FreezeFrame> SuperBrony64: I'm wondering what they were on.
<Trot_Rot> better
<Thunder_Dash> Did they died?
*Elky gives Luna a hug for that movie
<R-Zack> I don't think anyone should change their name to discord until how he acts, just for safety. :)
<Magenta> 13Doctor wearing that outfit is hilarious
<herospirit> Soooooo.... what the fuck was that movie about?
*TGPFluttershy brohoofs Luna
<Luna> 07and the best news
<Luna> 07tomorrow it's ON !

<Synros> yeah,......cannot wait...
<Alterego> Let's talk about trolls. Shall we?
<SuperBrony64> /IT WAS MAN!!
<Sol> It's about nothing
<Alterego> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtN1YnoL46Q
<VioletVanilla> 6 8DD
<Elky> I hate not being able to be there...
*Nightshade forgot how much he loved that film so gives Luna the biggest hug/cuddle he can :)
<Trouble> Caled teh human race
<VioletVanilla> 6THIS?!

<Sol> It's pure entertainment
<TheLotusTeaDragon> I can't believe I just sat here and watched an entire movie while chatting. LOL

<Sol> Were you entertained?
<KanyeNorthEast> welp, best movie ever

<R-Zack> The globe glows.
<Kencolt> Great, No neck AND depressing.
<Magenta> 13<3
<DibromYaY> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT
<SuperBrony64> *hoof claps*
<GrimGallop> I have a question about the movie.
<herospirit> WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT MOVIE EVEN ABOUT.
<R-Zack> <.<
<Ghosties> And I think the reason why I wouldn't discuss my complaints on /meta/ is because I can do that anytime of the day since I know Hipster and Cross personally and both of those guys always respond to threads
<Trot_Rot> so, who here has september 17th marked on every calender on their phones/computers?
<Sol> Now for Reprise
<TGPFluttershy> TIM CURRY!
<thegreatandpowerfulpattap> can we watch "back to the future" please
<KanyeNorthEast> it was about everything
<Bufurd> well

<Trouble> Might I ask? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsqJFIJ5lLs
<R-Zack> Love the original ending.
<Aponymous> Ooooooookay then. That was... I don't know.
<KanyeNorthEast> you'll never quite find another movie like that
<RAWRity> herospirit it was actually a metaphor for the sexual awakening and eventual psychological decline of the character Brad
<Discord> I don't. You think I can forget?
<interior_gummy> postshow?
<Dermathil> JANET (JANET)

<Silverscreen> 11You know, how I'm going to be making themes for each Pony?
*Octavia 13hugs Luna
<RAWRity> meh, I'm really starting to get bored with all the electronica, C'mon fandom, don't be no one trick pony!

<Elky> ds: it was terrific
<RAWRity> DSNesmith expectedly weird.
<Quill> what is this song called?
<UberMudkipzz> Hey, quick question to any Photoshop users here: Is there a way to save a .GIF image as a series (sequence) or .PNG or .JPG images at all? Thanks
<everrfreenights> rocky horror pinkie pie show WAS AWESOME
*SodapopFizz has to side with Pinkie's crew. can't have a party without soda afterall.
*TGPFluttershy is forever loyal to Celestia
<AniDragon> Was fun to watch the newbies/
<GrimGallop> I'm still trying to figure out what was going on o.o
*Kencolt respects Celestia... a worthy Alpha. Although Luna is also a worthy Alpha. The two share the role in his opinion.
<DuskShine> To be honest, I didn't really get to enjoy Rocky Horror.
<Sol> Newfriends weren't so keen on it :P
<UberMudkipzz> Been trying to do that all day :/
<Trot_Rot> ^ yeah
<Luna> 07WAT!
<DuskShine> My neighbors are asshats and were making loud noises all night.
<R-Zack> More songs will come the more episodes come in
<Trot_Rot> you take each individual frame of the .gif
<Quill> @kencolt indeed
<Trot_Rot> and save them seperately
<DuskShine> They'd been building a shed for the past month. =
<DuskShine> =/
<Dermathil> NEEDS MOAR LUNA WOLVES
<Elky> that's annoying
<Kencolt> I AM a wolf, after all. I think in those terms.
<RAWRity> duskshine try again tomorrow maybe?
<Synros> Rocky Horro was gayer then I love you Phillip Morris. It was goos
<ValtheJean> Gasp ghosties!
<DuskShine> I will.
<Trot_Rot> if you have a good file manager

<Octavia> 13Everyone is mane cast!
<R-Zack> Most of the time we find a way to make it pony-related
<AniDragon> So yeah, when someone mentioned NaPoWriMo, I TOTALLY thought the "Po" stood for pony. Googled it and everything, and only realized when I got to the FAQ that "po" stood for "poem".
<Octavia> 13Yayy~

<DecapKing> Hey Octavia
<Silverscreen> 11Dari, I need a copy of the html and the CSS you're already using.
<Lysiria> ...I was improvising, leave me alone. D:
<SirSprinkles> 6>really only thinks there should be themes for what rooms we have, with some exceptions
<Quill> yup
<DSNesmith> what was the second pony ep, btw?
<Ghosties> 4Exceptions?
<TGPFluttershy> I've never heard of ANYONE talking to himself on his facebook wall.
<Quill> IM AWESOME
<HaysforPonies> You should only sleep if you dream of pony. Otherwise you stay up for pony.
<Ghosties> 4Such as?
<TGPFluttershy> Applebuck season, DSENesmith
<SirSprinkles> 6Case-by-case
<Silverscreen> 11> Rooms based on ponies
<interior_gummy> dammit, this shit again>
<whizz_bang> elements of harmony
<DSNesmith> rofl, I love that line
<Silverscreen> 11> themes based on ponies
<DSNesmith> "hide in my hood like I'm joining a cult"
<a041744> This makes me lol
<SodapopFizz> >D
<Ghosties> 4Case by case? o.O
<VioletVanilla> 6I think it would be cool, I will put in forum, but if sometime everypony is not busy . . . maybe making a drawing/banner of all of the mods? n.n I think it would look cool. . .
<DSNesmith> RBD makes the best faces in this vid
<MetalGearSamus> Wow. Flash Player just crashed. O_o
<R-Zack> :P
<FreezeFrame> "And if you like this, it's cause my little sister wrote it."
<Ghosties> 4Color me intrigued
<FoxM> or bunny. Angel is best pet
<Nittany_Tiger> I have to remember how to solve vector partial diff eq.'s
<SodapopFizz> 'If you liked this, it's because my little sister wrote this'
<Elky> This song annoys me more than I ever thought possible
<Sol> Psh, I drive my mom's badass van and am not ashamed of it
<Spin> wel that sucked

<Dovey> Hey
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about harry enfield: loadsamoney
<SirSprinkles> 6drawing/banner of all the mods would be quite interesting
<FourCartridge> Ha
<Plorf> i'm so contextually relevant
<Kencolt> I still want 10 million Fluttershys. It makes me feel happy.
<lordpie> IM AWSOME
<R-Zack> WOAH
<Spin> Haha wow Plorf
<R-Zack> Anyone saw that part when she derped.
<DSNesmith> so I tried to draw RBD on my dorm's whiteboard, but I didn't have enough colors
<Whimsical> R-Zack
<quill1> yesssssss
<DSNesmith> it didn't come out very well
<SirSprinkles> 6As for the case-by-case thing, we're not going to need a theme for both Aloe AND Lotus, for example, it would be better to throw them together
<R-Zack> Yes, Whimsical?
<Sol> Jumanji reference, lol
<deoxys> Alright, Sneezey... if you're here, I came.
<RAWRity> i requested "Demented Cupcakes" by Foogoz
<Whimsical> Hellou~
<deoxys> Obivously.
<Reaver021> Damn Firefox crashed :/
<DSNesmith> the face she makes when she does that back kick
<SirSprinkles> 6And I'm sure people would like a Steven Magnet theme, dispite the fact that we don't have a room for him.
*DecapKing hugs Luna for no reason
<R-Zack> Hello Whimsical.
<DSNesmith> makes me squee every time
<RAWRity> *foozogz

<VioletVanilla> 6eeyup~
<Octavia> 13I'm still super jelly of the awesomeness that looks like Bronyvilles mareathon. And that they are featured as a banner on EqD. Too awesome.

<everrfreenights> DEAR GOD THE ANIMATION IS SO BAD.
<FreezeFrame> Glorious trolling
<Octavia> 13lol
<Luna> 07Alright well let's talk about your trial run
<DSNesmith> let's just be grateful that this is G1
<DSNesmith> it could be worse
<R-Zack> This is the 80s.
<Ghosties> 4OH you guys...
*Octavia 13is totally a hipster
<Synros> yah totally thats why I stay white
<mib_3z67dr> that blue one resembles my ponysona
<a041744> That animation glitch
<AwesomeKurt> They said everybody, what :/
<Jyvbrony> nice math, pony
<Elky> this is g1?
<Ghosties> 4Octavia is the new hipster
<R-Zack> Where video games were 8-bit
<Solarboy> And -967
<Sumica> and nose plugs
<Reaver021> The animation isn't THAT bad, just not modern :/
<Ghosties> 4Wait
<Octavia> 13lol
<Pontang> The sad part is that there was some pretty good style and animated in the mid 80s.
<Ghosties> 4...
<Pontang> :x
<DSNesmith> maybe not g1
<Ghosties> 4That makes you a poser
<Pontang> Well in Japan atleast.
<DSNesmith> but it's not... well, you knoe
<SirSprinkles> 6We probably could be if we got Hipster to throw his weight around.
<Ghosties> 4YOU'RE NOT A HIPSTER >: O
<Octavia> 13D:
<mib_3z67dr> i like how ALL of them have a VERy similar voice
<RAWRity> AND THE RUSSIAN JUDGE GIVES THEM A 4
<Aponymous> Sorta glad I wasn't alive in the '80s.
<Luna> 07lol
<Luna> 07Guys!
<R-Zack> Same.
<Kencolt> The animation is both bad AND not modern.
*Octavia 13is a fake hipster!
<Elky> because I thought G1 was waay better
<Pontang> The 80s had Gundam.
<Pontang> e_e
<Octavia> 13Sorry. lol
<SuperBrony64> Go Dream Team!
<Ghosties> 4Anyways
<Luna> 07We are here for something!
<Ghosties> 4Let's discuss this trial
<R-Zack> Games where only 8-bit back then and My Little Pony sucked.
<DSNesmith> THE CAROUSEL
<Kencolt> Gundam worked. THis doesn't.
<SuperBrony64> This is going to be considered practice for next week's showing of MLP: The Movie...

<Pontang> Poor Teddy.
<Synros> oh I see

<DSNesmith> Teddy was reincarnated as spike
<Darf14> Quiet women, you just saying that because of your obvious crush
<R-Zack> Teddy should be the prankster colt
<Elky> did they just say 'all teddy wants is to be laid'?
<Nittany_Tiger> What would Teddy's cutie mark be?
<R-Zack> in G4
<mib_3z67dr> winning is everything bitch
<Ghosties> 4Down, Val
<Nittany_Tiger> Not a comb.
<Sumica> one of us one of us
<a041744> MOB MENTALITY
<DSNesmith> choice
<Octavia> 13So that means Synros is on the team as a hop now right?
<DSNesmith> thennnn
<Ghosties> 4Put the happy juice away
<Synros> begint he programming
<Pontang> Well, if you've ever watched a harem, most of the main characters are 'pricks'.
<DuskShine> Question: Which pony is which pony?
<Pontang> :P
<SirReginald> oh snap
<Solarboy> Dat quality
<Jyvbrony> THAT WASNT AN OPTION
<Kencolt> I now wish to bite EVERYONE.
<RAWRity> TWILIGHT SPARKLE DOES NOT APPROVE OF THESE PONIES' ACTIONS
<ValtheJean> I believe so, yes
<LunarFrost> if he cant come no one can
<Sumica> she pulled a twilight
<DuskShine> I'm having a hard time telling any differences betwen them.
<Synros> yes Ghosties
<DSNesmith> pontang, harem-watching is one of my hobbies
<CriticKitty> That's not very friendship-like. These ponies are bad friends
<Reaver021> Jizz?
<whizz_bang> WAT
<Darf14> *looks for AJ*
<LunarFrost> fuck her
<Ghosties> 4Alright, so
<SuperBrony64> The white one is Sweetheart I think
<Pontang> These ponies are terrible people.
<RAWRity> is this gen 1 or 2?
<Ghosties> 4You're gonna enter our team as a Half Op
<Jyvbrony> yes, put teddy on a boat to china
<Pontang> Lol wut?
<Solarboy> Of course, send teddy to alaska
<LunarFrost> horse seman
<Pontang> This doesn't make any sense.

<SuperBrony64> The one with the comb is Teddy obviously
<Thunder_Dash> I'M ON A BOAT
<DSNesmith> Fleur-De-Lis cutie mark? Awesome
<Synros> ok
<RAWRity> mfw I cant' tell the males from the females.
<Ghosties> 4Meaning that you're a mod, but you can't ban anybody just yet
<Aponymous> Can you kill a tv show?
<Octavia> 13Something just feels amiss.
<Ghosties> 4But you can kick and the like
<Solarboy> What's the boat called? It's the Titanic,
<Jyvbrony> room is empty
<AwesomeKurt> I-I-I-_'m on a boat.

<DSNesmith> Teddy ends up murdered
<DuskShine> I'm... not entirely sure what to make of this.
<SilentEcho> Nice treaty
<VioletVanilla> 6How so? o:

<a041744> All I did was screw over your routine
<SirReginald> Why is the inkwell sliding against the rocking of the boat?
<Jyvbrony> rabble rabble

<ValtheJean> eenope
<Thunder_Dash> I've shattered my monitor and can't see what I'm doing, so I'm gonna go impale myself on the nearest sharp object I can find now
<ValtheJean> so for me
<SilentEcho> I think only infants would enjoy this
<VioletVanilla> 6,2Eeyup~
<Ghosties> 4Oh my, didn't know we had a connoisseur of bad MLP in the house :P
<SuperBrony64> Please no‚Ä¶how long is this?!
<ValtheJean> my command is ctrl+k: 2,14
<Kencolt> That wasn't quite my intention...
<RAWRity> i have an idea. why don't we take this cartoon...and FUCKING KILL IT.
<Jyvbrony> this makes me appreciate gen4 so much more
<SirReginald> lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and it gets me this
<Elky> and then Scootaloo broke her neck
<DSNesmith> >yfw this is half over
<herospirit> infants would not enjoy this either
<Synros> ok
<a041744> OoooooooooooooohhhaaaaaaaAAA
<VioletVanilla> 6,2
<Aponymous> Do you think their meat is edible?
<Darf14> So....how long did this generation last?
<Luna> 072 mins left
<Tovler> Infants would enjoy Matlock. They don't know diddly
<Luna> 07hang in there!
<SuperBrony64> Depends‚Ä¶what do you mean by the word "connoisseur"...
<Reaver021> BLEED FASTER, STAB WOUND OF MINE.
<herospirit> I'm going to cry
<FreezeFrame> My maniacal laughter is getting a workout
<R-Zack> At least G3.5 Scootaloo has good facial expressions, but thats about it
*DSNesmith laughs manically
<Pontang> I would like to see a bazooka do something to these ponies...
<ValtheJean> no spaces
<SilentEcho> Close your mouth Pinkie D:
<Ghosties> 4It's starting to sound like Sims music
<Reaver021> BLEEEEEEDDDDDDDDD
<CarrotTop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=josw4pxJcsc
<DuskShine> Two minutes left and yet pretty much nothing has happened.
<ValtheJean> just ctrl+k:#,#
<RAWRity> I WILL NEVER COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SEA PONIES EVER AGAIN.
<Synros> anythign else?
<VioletVanilla> 6,2There are no spaces. . .
<Nittany_Tiger> Please tell Celestia to send Luna back to the moon for this.
<CriticKitty> I like how Scootaloo is not only not cool, but is almost obnoxious.
<DSNesmith> MORAL OF THE EPISODE TIME
<Pontang> This didn't make any sense.
<ValtheJean> buh......
<DSNesmith> DE END
<ValtheJean> oh
<Solarboy> Wait, what.
<Thunder_Dash> I'D RATHER HAVE SEA PONIES THAN THIS
<CriticKitty> .....
<Jyvbrony> DEAR PRINCESS CELESTIA
<Reaver021> SEA PONIES ARE HEAVEN COMPARED TO THIS.
<Sol> Fuck this shit, I'm going back to my murder mysteries.... maybe I'll kill some 3.6 ponies....
<SilentEcho> YAYAY
<whizz_bang> what even happened
<AwesomeKurt> Those diapers with cutie marks on them must be expensive if they have to make one for everypony, and most people know how many diapers a baby can go through. Also, how did they get cutie marks at such a young age?
<Pontang> What moral? It had nothing to do about this.
<DSNesmith> now we play the opening backwards
<ValtheJean> no ctrl+k after the comma
<Octavia> 13I think Dari has to setup the rest for hop and such.
<Veewave> Horses can stand on there own and even run minutes after they're born; therefore, these must be handicapped.
<CriticKitty> WAIT WHAT
<Dark_Heart> ya
<R-Zack> Meanwhile.
<Razyn> 0Now Nittany
<Darf14> Its over.....*cries*
<Kencolt> I would get diabetes if I bit.. those... those... they are NOT Ponies as I know pon ies...
<ValtheJean> only need to press it once
<VioletVanilla> 6,2I am an idiot? x.x
<R-Zack> FIRE ORBITAL FRIENDSHIP CANNON.
<FreezeFrame> So, 3.6 was 3.5 Cheerilee telling stories about being a kid?
<DSNesmith> dat filler ending/opening stock footage
<Nittany_Tiger> Dear Princess Celestia, please kill me.
<CriticKitty> THAT CAN'T BE THE END. What's the morale?
<Thunder_Dash> SEA PONIES ARE AT LEAST SO BAD IT'S HILARIOUSLY AWFUL
<ValtheJean> thar you go!
<Ghosties> 4Sath, what was this video?
<a041744> That was the worst thing I have ever seen, till the next time i watch G3.5

<SilentEcho> Agreed!!
<SillyNilly|Vector> Huh, that was quirky.
<DuskShine> I feel bad for the people who made this.
<SodapopFizz> Well it wasn't the worst thing I've ever watched.
<LunarFrost> that name sounds familiar
<Tovler> Ice king was reading a fanfiction about newborn cuties.
<DSNesmith> there was a storyboard artist?
<VioletVanilla> 6,12but which one is better?
*Ghosties 4goes off to screencap all of Scoot's awesome facial animations
<Darf14> Lets never speak of this again
<Solarboy> Animators:none

<Razyn> 0There was a story board?
<CriticKitty> Oh, wait, I know. The morale of the story is, when your Flash animators, voice actors, and directors don't give a shit, you produce shit.
<interior_gummy> that never happened
<Octavia> 13You're welcome.
<Ghosties> 4It's our pleasure, Synros. Thank you for being here

<Mason_Trowel> It was enjoyable to a degree, but I didn't like that its stories were spread out over three different mediums (anime, manga, and video game)
<FreezeFrame> We need an episode of G1 that had the Bag of Tirac
<DannySwish> it hayz nizze muuzic.
*Filter didnt play portal, don't even plan to

<RAWRity> And then the woman at the window had a mental breakdown.
<R-Zack> <.<
<a041744> What do you mean its not AWESOME!?
<Mason_Trowel> There's really no point. While I found Portal 1 enjoyable to a degree, I felt it didn't live up to its hype.
<Reaver021> *Can't stp chuckling*
<ValtheJean> when will you need the email images by to make it in time for the newsletter?
<DSNesmith> one of THOSE
<Aponymous> His impression is actually pretty good.
<herospirit> this is amazing
<Sumica> call it what you want still comes off short bus
<FreezeFrame> It's dead on.
<Sidestroke> Like, if you have a reason for not liking it I'm okay with it. But the least you could do is explain why
<Darf14> Can't tell if they are acting or they are actually trolling the store
<a041744> THe DRAMA, the DRAMA!!
<Octavia> Yes, MrEvergreen?
<DannySwish> so yeah what I did was I had Portal 1 and 2 open at the same time and took screenshots of me looking at the same things :D
<Sidestroke> And yeah, Portal hype is massive though.
<Mason_Trowel> Plus, I never bought Portal 1. I borrowed it from my friend and beat it in a single night.
<RAWRity> OH MAN OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD
<Filter> Music's not bad
<DSNesmith> PLUS TAX
<Tovler> Shortbus is a terrible B movie
<Reaver021> lolz
<DSNesmith> the lady sounds terrified
<Plorf> I didn't play Portal 1 :c
<Foshers> Really? I thought the story and the humor was great
<AlphaOmega> well Portal 1 was ment as a fun little Mini game rather than a full on game
<Mason_Trowel> Since my friend does not have Portal 2, I can't play it.
<DSNesmith> PONY TOYS
<GrimGallop> O.o
<DannySwish> I see Sidestroke likes it :D
<Plorf> I did do Portal 2, since I borrowed it from a friend.
<Reaver021> LOL
<RAWRity> OH MAN OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD
<sotha> I want a pony toy
<Plorf> But I feel like I'm missing out
<DannySwish> Portal 2 is more of a full game
<SirSprinkles> 6MR. SOCKLES
<a041744> MR SUCKLES!!!
*Octavia beat portal2 too quickly :/
<Mason_Trowel> Oh, it certainly did have good humor, and I really liked the ending song.
<Tovler> Pony toys?
<Sidestroke> The music's not bad? The music is awesome
<DSNesmith> this guy is an amazing troll
<DannySwish> Everythings funny
<Reaver021> I'm laughing my ass off...
<DannySwish> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df150UHbBJo
<Plorf> Oh god, there was one Portal 2 room that I just despised
<DannySwish> hazz ending song!!!
<Darf14> That man is a boss!
<Filter> Blizzard makes far better music
<DannySwish> which one?
<Plorf> It was one of my least favorite moments in video games
<ValtheJean> oh silver isn't here
<deoxys> 0YES
<DSNesmith> oh applejack
<DSNesmith> you are so silly
<DannySwish> when?
<a041744> THAT, just TAHT
<Dermathil> so he got his toys?
<Thunder_Dash> YES.
<Sidestroke> The reason I like Portal? Creativity
<SilentEcho> LOL
<Tovler> YOU IS
<DannySwish> Its awesome
<DannySwish> yeah
<Mason_Trowel> It certainly was that
<Dermathil> OH SNAP
<Plorf> It was the giant room with the tower of stairs in the middle
<DannySwish> but Plorf
<Ghosties> 4Well guys, I think I'm out for the evening
<Plorf> Everything involved in that
<Octavia> 13Whos a silly pony? You're a silly pony! Who is? You is! Applejack!

<Sidestroke> It was just brimming with creative puzzle-play and witty dialogue.
<a041744> You sillypony!
<Plorf> I LOATHED it
<Octavia> >.>
<Mason_Trowel> The Portal Gun was, in and of itself, quite ingenious.
<ValtheJean> have a good night ghosties
<Octavia> 13Goodnight Ghosties
<DannySwish> stairs‚Ä¶in the middle...
<DannySwish> uuh...
<Ghosties> 4*waves*

<Plorf> Near the beginning of it
<DannySwish> oh
<DannySwish> um
<SilentEcho> lol
<a041744> use your Horsesense!!
<DannySwish> stairs...stairs...
<Mason_Trowel> But, as for the rest, like I said, it didn't really live up to its rather MASSIVE internet hype.
<Octavia> 13Whos a silly pony? You're a silly pony! Who is? You is! Applejack!
<Veewave> Bye Y'all.
<SuperBrony64> SushiJack = Japanese Applejack
<Pontang> Apple = Ringo
<Pontang> :x
<Sidestroke> It was quite unlike anything I'd played before, and it was brilliant.
<DannySwish> I don't remember stairs.
<Sidestroke> Mason?
<Quill2> ...
<Plorf> There's an elevator shaft
<Reaver021> See ya, VeeWave!
<Sidestroke> That's like asking a king to be a god
