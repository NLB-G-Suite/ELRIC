<alexxm> i've been good EggWhite
<CrimsonPhoenix> you open that only to get a new browser
<EggWhite> I use the best web browser.
<EggWhite> Lolifox.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's...kinda sad don't you think?
<Braviary> Anything on right now?
<AgentKalim> Ranfox all the way

<Spade-Magnes[R]> Seriously who uses IE anymore

<CrimsonPhoenix> no one
<Braviary> I use IE.
<EggWhite> http://www.levistone.net/img/img7_lolifox.png
<CK|Basara> Pretty sure the idea of Fox as an underaged anthro girl is kind of....weird.

<AttackWithHugs> I use IE too......if I need to do something in Windows Explorer and can't reach it through Program Files
<Cypresswolf> I got off early ^_^ as soon as I finish eating, I'm off to the Galveston meetup - best to head out before 3 as traffic starts to pick up
<Spade-Magnes[R]> But in all honesty IE is only good for one thing
<CrimsonPhoenix> I used to browse with Firefox but I've switched to chrome JUST recently
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Getting a better browser
<HyperMetalLugia> weird
<HyperMetalLugia> :s
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah Spade-Magnes[R] but just think of how sad this must be if browser had emotion
<EggWhite> I'm gonna assume that BronyStates mail server thingy is still...ded.
<Cypresswolf> actually meetup is tomorrow, I'm just heading out early to avoid the weekend traffic

<GilDash> User0: Awesome. :)
<GilDash> User0: I'm only destroying Access though. :D

<Om> Ninjazz: What you did there, is like yelling sneak attack. To sneak attack
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Of course. Would we be the same otherwise? :)
<NullRadix> but if you don't yell Sneak attack, you don't get sneak attack bonuses
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ona7QYULRVE&feature=related <--- ALL MR T commercials with Snickers. XD
<AgentKalim> That was the very antithesis of sneaking. :P

*SuperBrony64 has his plot nommed on D:
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moooooo O~O
<Lunar_Brony> what did i miss? I was crying manly tears
<ACS13123> I feel I might add a Meet the Pyro frame to my background rotation
<ACS13123> SuperBrony64: Moooo :3
<sergio_scriptor> ACS13123: pyroland or crapworld ? :)
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64 you lagging slightly?
<Lunar_Brony> ACS13123 do you know how to get one of those on Windows XP?
<Chrysalis> ACS13123 pyroland is AMAZING
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Lagging? O.o
<Lunar_Brony> sergio_scriptor Pyroland probably. The other is Downtown Teufort
<ACS13123> sergio_scriptor: 1 with all the baby things in Pyroland and the one where pyros burning sniper in Crapworld :/
<TheMaster> Do you believe in magic?
*Lunar_Brony believes in magic
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64 yeah took you a few minutes to react to being nommed on and mooing
<ACS13123> TheMaster: maybe....
<TheMaster> In a young girls heart~?
<TheMaster> That song is unreasonably catchy
<sergio_scriptor> you know what my greatest wish for tf2 is ? for valve to bring back the civilian class from ttf classic :(
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<sergio_scriptor> tf classic *
<ACS13123> sergio_scriptor: dunno, what game mode would it work in, I mean with all the waepons, you could just kill you and kill you and kill you oVo
<alexxm> sergio_scriptor what would the civillain class do
<MrBen> Is the stream dead again?
<Lunar_Brony> sergio_scriptor there is a possibility. The evidence is in the coding: there is a "Civilian" class and Announcer line in the game
<Lunar_Brony> it's just unused
<sergio_scriptor> ACS13123 and alexxm : the civilian in tf classic had a game modoe,where the blue team is only snipers that try to kill the civilian and the red team is trying to protect the only civilian player during the round
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Chrysalis: I'm doing other stuff right now as well ><
<DWR_PokemonWhite2> SuperBrony64 Like being a silly filly?
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64 ah, fair enough, hope its all ok
<sergio_scriptor> Lunar_Brony: i realy wish they would bring him back,like "the civlian update" and he get a meet the civilian or something :)
<MrBen> I take it the stream's down for the moment, since nobody answered my question.
<Lunar_Brony> sergio_scriptor Valve has been hinting at it since the first Halloween update
<sergio_scriptor> MrBen: indeed

<CallofLukey> Rarity wasn't the best.
<Vordox> Deja Vu...my brain..hurting...time travel shock
<twilight_sprinkle> did twi say thanks?
<Viri> 14o.o
*Spectrum_Rush|Zzz tackles Ninjazz|Fics
<operatorPony> SO who's perspective is this story from anywyas?
<Metronome> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Kammerjunk> CallofLukey: Rarity was speaking out of a paper tube.
<Ninjazz|Fics> CallofLukey: Watch your words. :|
<String_Shredder> Rarity had more of an Irish accent just then
<Metronome> :'(
<Lil_B> bye (Rarity is best Pony)
<Om> AttackWithHugs: xD
<CompressedTyme> Everybody is a critic!
<Groogle> Her body is ready jk
<operatorPony> Rarity is sexiest pony
<AttackWithHugs> Om: Don't let it get you dowwwwn
<Ninjazz|Fics> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: oof!
<Groogle> Sorry
<Ninjazz|Fics> operatorPony: AWW HELL YEAH!
<CallofLukey> Rarity is the best. But her voice acting isn't.
<twilight_sprinkle> Rarity is the hardest character to VA, ever
<CallofLukey> ;)
*Spectrum_Rush|Zzz squeezes Ninjazz|Fics
<turtlegod98> :'(
<Barbetos|Atwork> operatorPony I think it is a self insert of the auther, ROBcrakerin or whatever.
<Kammerjunk> CompressedTyme: Yes, everybody's a critic, but that's because all the world's a stage.
<Om> AttackWithHugs: Y? :D
<AgentKalim> Voice acting can be judged objectively, based on the similarity to the original voice, and that WASN'T good. Period.
<RaveBrony> Raritys voice is WAS too unique to copy! :D
*Ninjazz|Fics embraces Spectrum_Rush|Zzz with squeezes of his own
<RaveBrony> *WAY
<CompressedTyme> Kammerjunk: clever very clever indeed
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> eyes y u burn so
<CallofLukey> :(
<Metronome> :'(
<AttackWithHugs> Om: You should never let something bring you down, it's not good for you :)
<Groogle> Oh hell no no
<RaveBrony> :'(
<Groogle> *sniff*
<AgentKalim> No more ponies
<Groogle> :'(
<twilight_sprinkle> ...oh well, time to build a portal to Equestria
<RaveBrony> ^
<Ninjazz|Fics> ^^
<Kammerjunk> "You're wrong when it's right"
<Braviary> I don't see why this makes others cry. I must just be a heartless robot.
<GreenWarrior1456> :'(
<Ethereal> ^^^
<AgentKalim> Yeah good luck with that.
<CallofLukey> I'll go get the obsidian.
<CallofLukey> You get the flint and Steel.
<Om> AttackWithHugs: What is good or not for me is of little consiquence if I learn something from it :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Tune in for the Sequel!
<Groogle> That makes me so sad
<twilight_sprinkle> Scoot-Scootaloo: is it gonna be now?
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: There is one. It's on the Moon. Getting there will cost you around 1000 bits, which at the current exchange rate falls in the ballpark of a lot of money.
<Metronome> OH NO HELL NO:'(
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03yessir
<twilight_sprinkle> yay
<Metronome> HELL NO
<RaveBrony> Sequel? O.o

<Rain> why is there no newsletter this week?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: ill do all i can to get that money
<Braviary> Maybe this guy was just tripping on carbon monoxide or something, and he imagined he was with Rainbow Dash, and he's just sobering up.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Rain: We have something planned for next week.
<AgentKalim> Yeah
<Braviary> Those 15 years were just a few hours.
<AgentKalim> sobering up in 15 years
<AgentKalim> sure
<Om> AttackWithHugs: I'm an Om, and I doubt that. :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: although i doubt i have the health to make it in a space rocket
<Kammerjunk> Braviary: We can't stop here! This is Dash-country.
<RaveBrony> Yay!!! <3

<Yellowquiet> 1000/10
*Ninjazz|Fics is immune to this story and it's tear jerking tactics
<AgentKalim> I didn't cry once when reading My Little Dashie, but DAT VOICE ACTING just got to me.
<CallofLukey> It's sad, because you wanted it to be true, but then you didn't.
<Marx> I've already read it, but it still makes me sad.

<Ninjazz|Fics> Kammerjunk: Aye. But a story like MLD being one THE most popular stories on the ponynet, I'm sure it would have gotten ALOT of sequals.

<Mare_On_The_Moon> im back
<Crono_brony> i need to stop listening... NOW. I've cried 3 times... and I cannot take anymore.

<CompressedTyme> u all may have cried, but did your hearts explode???
<Kammerjunk> I have no clue as to why.
<Feel_like_a_muffin> :(
<Ninjazz|Fics> Om: Especially reading.

<Mare_On_The_Moon> WHAT DID I MISS
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> a mid-atlantic accent is not easy to pull off

<AskDerpyDoo> Mica what happened to that effect?
<otakon> Kammerjunk: don't need to, tis boring scifi
<SolairePony89> Kammerjunk: Nothing that's entertaining

*IMissOsamaBrony panics and jumps back into air vent to hide where
<Kammerjunk> ...I think.
<DSNesmith> seven was when they started getting all... anime
<AdamThePony> The URL of the Dramatic Reading we listened to not long ago.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Final Fantasy is about beign repetative and keeping ancient game mechanics.
<otakon> THIS MOVIE HAS LESS THAN ZERO TO DO WITH THE GAMES!
<DeadlyPon3> Shizuka I PAAANIC BECAUSE AMERICA
<MrBen> Freefall: From what I hear, no, not really.
<trollhunter> hows it going Orange_peel
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Exactly
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: People need to stop startin.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Thats a good thing.
<MrBen> But we'll see for ourselves, ya?
<otakon> Spirits Within I mean
<Freefall29> Looks like I won't be missing much
<AskDerpyDoo> yes... it helped me creating the true religion
<Silverscreen> 1,11I don't know, I wasn't here for it.
<Taeguk> :[
<AdamThePony> Damn.
<Meanwhile> What RX said.
<Shizuka> 13oh right spirits within tonight
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: it's also NOT entertaining
<Shizuka> 13may as well put that on screen two
<TheXIIILightning> Freefall29: It's cool, the special effects are great, but the story... Meh
<MrBen> I'm looking forward to it, at least!
<DSNesmith> I've never beaten six, actually
<Cypresswolf> Well it turns out there is some signal down here :) not sure who's but I'm using it :P
<Luna1337> better get some popcorn
<AdamThePony> It'll take me forever to find that damn video
<Groogle> I'm just playing God hand :)
<DSNesmith> I hear it's really good
<Riders> Freefall29 = It's a decent sci-fi movie. It was just really expensive and poorly marketed
<AskDerpyDoo> yes its good... it helped me creating the true religion
<TheXIIILightning> Freefall29: Still it's a good movie and fun ^^
<DSNesmith> but it can never keep my attention past the part with the moogles in the intro
<Freefall29> is it even based on a specific final fantasy game?
<IMissOsamaBrony> Vordox MAH PONY AHHHHH PANICING
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I remember enjoying 6
<AdamThePony> No.

<DSNesmith> one thing JRPGs never seem to get right for me is difficulty curve
<DSNesmith> they always swing too easy (Chrono Trigger) or too hard (FF3)
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I didnt like 2, but I need to try 3 and 4

By the time the final shots were rendered, some of the earlier ones had to be redone because they didn't match anymore. Also, the software used to create them had become more advanced (and hence more detail was possible).

<OctaviaDashPie1797> Entertaining at most.
<Jspang1> o
<Invi> moin Lil :D
<DSNesmith> it looked pretty fantastic
<Riders> It may not be Final Fantasy but I still think it's better than the last 12 or 13 years of Final Fantasy, barring FF12.
<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: Used to build in GMod. Then Minecraft happened.
<AskDerpyDoo> THIS movie has an ORBITAL FRIENDSHIP CANNON

<DSNesmith> I'm surprised with the graphics they've been pulling out of source lately. Portal 2 looked quite good for still being on such an aging engine.
<twilight_sprinkle> invisible monsters sure would suck

<Orange_Peel> Derpyrox: So far I think it's doing u a favor
<DeadlyPon3> Why did she go down there?
<Randomnerd> otakon: Good one.
<TheXIIILightning> Gello
<AgentKalim> It's just not a very good movie.
<Jim> Shizuka: lol
<herostar> but then, i was stopped... with all my stuff.... i was griefed... i was killed... my hopes shattered..
<Meanwhile> SolairePony89: you guess wrong. They'll do it the way they did before we had a newsletter.
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: This was the first Final Fantasy not scored by series composer Nobuo Uematsu, the man behind the music of all ten FF games (excluding Final Fantasy Tactics, composed by Masanari Iwata/Hitoshi Sakimoto). His music is so loved by fans that it is often released on separate CDs by popular demand.

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Dr. Aki Ross' hair is only half as dense as the average human crop, however, that still left 60,000 strands to put realistically into motion. When designing the computer graphics, a fifth of the time spent was devoted to those 60,000 hairs.
<Pinkielover123> It means " Shit "

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During preproduction, the script went through 50 incarnations. In one such form there was a small child named Meg, who had a much larger part in the overall story. In the final version of the film the fifth spirit was drawn from a terminally ill child. This is the only reference to Meg left in the final version. Other characters that didn't make the final cut

<spiritKirz> 8,6if you cast Ultima on a planet, it explodes and chain-casts Meteor on the next planet :3
<otakon> SolairePony89: same here
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Prior to the film's release, there was speculation that the photo-realistic computer-generated "actors" would revolutionize moviemaking. There were news reports of plans for the "digital actress" used for Aki Ross to appear in another movie, or possibly be included in a live-action production amongst real actors. The box office failure of this film put those plans
<Silverscreen> 1,11on hold, however a special sequence created for the special edition version of the DVD, which opens disc 2, does in fact show Aki and other FF characters interacting with real people.
<GilDash> That went well for them. :D

<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Let's review....they claim they're using human tissue to power their lasers. That makes no sense. "We don't know what tech they have" isn't a good enough reason to stop calling bullshit on that.

<Saigneur> MINDFUCK
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In an earlier version of the script, Cid and Aki were originally grandfather and granddaughter. Aki's last name was also different: she was originally Aki Shishido. The relationship and names were changed late enough into production that many of the animators and staff didn't even know of the modification of the script until the film was nearly finished.

<AgentKalim> She has a dream, but Martin Luther King she ain't.
<Randomnerd> otakon: The implication is that the "core" worlds had it okay, like in Firefly
<DSNesmith> and the extra restriction was what prevented constant conflict like the republic had
<AskDerpyDoo> its a memory
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: you cant prove its gibberish. people often build technology in immitation to nature

<Spirit_Vordox> Well that's BAD news
<Kurra> Remedy doesn't cure KO, Curse, or Zombie! D:
<RosePetal1> She's under the influence of drugs.
<Sumica> 00,10Still find it funny this movie bombed so hard they had to make porn with the software inorder to recoop the losses.
<otakon> She's UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE PHANTOMS!

<Kurra> no wait I said that already, Petrify.
<DSNesmith> also it's prohuman doctrine was a bit limiting
<red_ony> what about destroying all trhat could be used against her didn't she understand..

<twilight_sprinkle> Arcness: A MAN CAN DREAM!
<Spirit_Vordox> Sumica: It didn't bomb for me, I like this movie
<drf|laptop> 03the pictures were really grainy and blurry looking
<Ersatz> Seriously, Sumica?
<inkBot> yes she is obvioulsy under the influence of the phantoms that looks NOTHING like what we just saw from her recordings. LOGIC!
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: The problem with that logic is that it's using something that CAN'T power a laser to power a laser.
<Sumica> 00,10eeeeyup
<RosePetal1> What the aliens.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Dream..cast
<pikorar> It's not, I already checked.
<Kammerjunk> CupcakeWarrior: Yeah, A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.
<Silverscreen> 1,11....
<Bronysith> Empire is better than republic
<DocSane> Get ready to do something incredibly stupid, Major.
<pony_300> ROFL SUmica
<Pinkies4thWall> SEEEGAAAAAAAAA
<Randomnerd> Expecially since an empire cannot afford to ignore a talent.
<otakon> so...the aliens are fighing the aliens?
<Dat_MLP> RAPE HORDE
<DSNesmith> but inevitably when the republic takes over things fall apart in years
<IMissOsamaBrony> ALIEN VS PREDITOR
<drf|laptop> 03which I'm guessing is just a remnant of the high resolution?
<Bronysith> there is no stupid ass 90000 member senate
<TessHM> WHATS POKING ME
<Taeguk> Another stampede?
<herostar> he's prolly shitting himself
<AgentKalim> The technology used in making this movie would go to a better use making porn.
<Meanwhile> Alien wars.
<Ersatz> Well, programmers gotta eat.
<IMissOsamaBrony> GANG BANG
<Aegis3423> wat
<AttackWithHugs> Sumica: Learn something new every day
<Arcness> LETS HUG

<RosePetal1> I am me.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> DAMN IT DEATHWING
<Om> Everbody dead!
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: A logical equal to this would be if I said that you can't PROVE that it's impossible to make a gun that shoots bees instead of bullets. Sure, you can't prove it, but you can probably call bullshit on it. Given that it's nonsensical and stupid.
<IMissOsamaBrony> TAC NUKE!!!
<Aegis3423> god dam haxors
<AgentKalim> Yeah
<spiritKirz> 8,6yep
<IMissOsamaBrony> AHHHHH

<AgentKalim> And HOW do they know there's eight spirits?
<SpeedyBolt> No.
<Bronysith> DSNesmith: i just count the OT and KoToR canon
<Meanwhile> Ackey.
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<DSNesmith> the early EU ones are really bad
<IMissOsamaBrony> HER NAME IS AQUI
<Riders> In the vein of John Carter and Treasure Planet, it's one of the biggest Box office bombs of all time that didn't quite deserve this massive of a financial failure. Although I do enjoy this much more than John Carter.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: pf, are you actually saying a gun liek that is impossible
<DSNesmith> all the one-shots
