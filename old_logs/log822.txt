<Snowden> Bronysith: sometimes, shit happens, and people freak
<Kandarihu> Snowden, the guns aren't free. They cost money.
<Bronysith> Snowden: yea, but they blame the guns, which is stupid, "guns and video games are the cause of death" never the person behind the gun T~T
<Uakh> I want F1 2012 now...racing games are the only games I don't suck at online... I hate how steam rapes my wallet too.
<RoboGerbil> Snowden: free gun with every book purchase
<Socks> All americans should be allowed to carry guns, look at this piece of paper, it must be true
<Snowden> Kandarihu: expression, not litterally. some states are really lose with gun laws
<Randomnerd> Hi, all!
<KrazyNoobs> Hi Randomnerd
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Randomnerd
<Randomnerd> :)
<Socks> Randomnerd: Heyo, welcome to gun conversation
<RoboGerbil> guns dont kil people, bullets do
<Randomnerd> Oy.
<Rainbow_Dashie> what game is this
<Kandarihu> Snowden, and the state that the school shooting happened in has pretty strict gunlaws.
<Snowden> Bronysith: its easier to blame the game for corrupting rather than excepth that a helthy human man thought it was a good idea to do what he did,
<KrazyNoobs> But bullets need guns to kill people, RoboGerbil.
<Socks> Guns don't kill people, people kill people, but guns help.
<CriticKitten> What amuses me is that people rush to defend the second amendment but are trying to destroy the first amendment to do so. Funny how those amendment thingies only matter when it's defending the thing YOU care about.
<Kandarihu> Rainbow_Dashie, Just Cause 2
<Uakh> Kandarihu: didn't he get his guns in NJ though ?
<Socks> Guns don't kill people, people kill people, but guns help.
<Rainbow_Dashie> thanks looks good
<Randomnerd> Ironically, Connecticut is also the state where Colt is based.
<KrazyNoobs> Socks: Yes.
<Socks> As eddie izzard wisely said
<Uakh> Socks: guns don't kill people, people kill people, but disarmed people kill statistically less people
<NullRadix> CriticKitten: Penny arcade covered that this week
<Socks> Uakh: XD
<NullRadix> which is odd because normally thats closer to XKCD territory
<CriticKitten> Null: Yeah I know
<Kandarihu> Socks, so do knives and baseball bats and cars and damaged electrical equipment... etc.
<Bronysith> Snowden: i dont care, im still buying a gun
<Socks> Eddie Izzard is like a real life XKCD exept more so
<Snowden> Bronysith: Go for it, just stay sane and all
<CriticKitten> It still amuses me all the same. Just you watch, this upcoming policy bill will include restrictions on video games and other "violent media".
<Randomnerd> I find Eddie Izzard vastly more entertaining than xkcd.
<CriticKitten> It's already on the table, so you know it's coming.
<Socks> Keep your guns, just make them hard to get n' stuff. Like a car.
<Randomnerd> CriticKitten: Yeah. It's everyone's fault but Wayne LaPierre's.
<Socks> I love them both
<Randomnerd> Sigh.
<CriticKitten> And everyone will be too fixated on the gun control bits that they'll be able to slide the rest in.
<Snowden> Socks: a friend of mine said that its easier to controll the ammo, because you can always get guns illegally
<Randomnerd> Politicians are all the same, even the unelected ones.
<Bronysith> Snowden: i have the right to defend myself if some ass hole decides to try and rob my house
<Kandarihu> Socks, in a pinch, that's the same as not allowing them to have guns in the first place.
<CriticKitten> Just watch. Shy of another internet uprising, it will fricking happen.
<GilDash> Or you could put your guns in a gun cabinate, like we do in the UK.
<tak025> :)
<Uakh> On another but closely related topic, I must say I am watching the country heading toward the fiscal cliff full steam with a morbid curiosity.
<Socks> Meh, i'm not going to get into the gun discussion. I have my views you have yours. but I am right becasue I am british :P
<CriticKitten> Dat fall. O.o
<Kandarihu> The 2nd Amendment guarantees the right to keep AND BEAR arms. "Bear Arms" doesn't mean keeping the gun in the trunk of your car but "Sorry, your ammo is in another castle."
<CriticKitten> I don
<Uakh> I secretely hope negociations will fail and the whole thing blows up
<CriticKitten> I don't think human bodies work that way. XD
<Uakh> for the lulz
<Snowden> Bronysith: what have we done >_> the chats goin crazy
<Randomnerd> Uakh: It's just more silliness, nothing will come of it.
<mitamaking> What is going on to this chat?
*Socks stabs Gun conversation
<Randomnerd> Meh.
<Uakh> Randomnerd: pres of federal reserve played cockblock by managing to give 2 more months until the us have to default.
<Socks> There it's ded, now ponies!
<Randomnerd> So, can we talk about ponies now?
<mitamaking> Oh crap it's the parachute game, I don't remember the name of
<Snowden> mitamaking: this is what happens sometimes during the week days, someone brings up a contreversial conversation and we run it till we get bored or embaressed
<Casey1859> Parachute ponies. Yes.
<Socks> Ponies have no fingers so they can have no guns
<Randomnerd> Up to which ep can we discuss, more importantly.
<Uakh> Socks: except unicorns
<Casey1859> I like that point.
<Socks> There fore it is more peaceful
<Kandarihu> We really should be vigilant about this. Censorship legislation CAN happen, and it HAS happened in the past. Movies and Television have been suppressed under the Hayes Code for decades. We can't rule out the possibility of something equally as backwards happening to video games now.
<Socks> Damn, the unicorns alwasy mess things up ¬_¬
<Randomnerd> Unicorns are OP.
<Socks> ^
<Casey1859> They just use their horns for... de magiks.
<CriticKitten> Oh, it's gonna happen, Kandarihu.
<Randomnerd> They can fly!
<mitamaking> Unicorns do not seem OP, Twillight is
*Socks likes existing in a reletively culturally free country
<Uakh> Kandarihu: all it'll do isdriving editors to move to Québec...oh wait they already are.
<CriticKitten> They've already admitted that a censorship ban is on the table at the discussions for this policy bill in Januaru.
<Dark_Horst> twilight doesnt fly, silly
<CriticKitten> *January
<Dark_Horst> she self levitates and fucks with gravity
<Casey1859> But she can fly.
<Dark_Horst> but she doesnt fly
<mitamaking> Stupid car
<JRP> Is Superbrony64 here
<Socks> She doesn't "fly"
<Casey1859> Buuut
<Casey1859> She Can.
<Snowden> she CAN fly
<Snowden> she just prefers not to
<mitamaking> Press space
<Uakh> if this results in CoD being pulled off shelves...I'm somewhat ok with that.
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, in that case, it's war.
<Socks> She can teleport, why would she want to fly?
<CriticKitten> So it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of whether or not people can publicize it widely enough like they did with SOPA.
<Casey1859> SHE CAN FLY! But she doesn't want to, so she doesn't usually fly!
<mitamaking> The thing is NRA did not attack any games with realistic guns in it
<mitamaking> So CoD is safe
<Bronysith> mitamaking: they just shoehorned in that violent videogames are bad
<Dark_Horst> >realistic guns
<Dark_Horst> >CoD
<Uakh> wait, CoD is realistic ?
<CriticKitten> 'cuz it'll definitely be in the bill, and most people will be too focused on the gun control portions of the bill to even notice that violent media will be censored.
<Casey1859> So...What is the controverstial topic at hand?
<Havok> dat moment when all the internet fails except MIRC
<XAX> so guys
<XAX> http://boards.4chan.org/mlp/res/6888010
<Snowden> *abort thread*
<XAX> what would yours be?
<Dark_Horst> i'm sorry, but the only game that will give you even remotely realistic guns is arma 2
<Dark_Horst> and thatÄs boring as shit
<Socks> They talked about a game no one had ever heard of, "Kindergarten Killer" because I judge all books on the stuff I read on fanfiction.net
<Vivix> Arma fails at being realistic due to a cheap physics engine and lackluster programming
<Dark_Horst> becasue it's a simulato
<Dark_Horst> it's also a buggy mess
<Socks> It's better with zombies
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, I'm not sure that people won't notice media censorship in the bill. The people who don't care about the 2nd Amendment will DEFINITELY care about media censorship.
<Randomnerd> Wayne LaPierre is like any other shmuck politician. He refuses to admit any culpability in what happened, and blamed a convenient scapegoat. His solution involves increasing the power of his organization.
<Bronysith> at least fallout and persona and final fantasy and chrono trigger are safe
<Vivix> it is, I would hardly call it a simulator due to how th game is- but it can be fun with friends
<Uakh> oh yeah, I'm sure UT3 is what the next generation of cold blooded killers trains on... Just wait till mass murderers walljump their way through the cops and t-bag them...
<Dark_Horst> arma is the most realistic combat simulation you will get
*Socks got final fantasy 6 for christmas ^_^
<Dark_Horst> they developed it for the military
<Bronysith> Socks: thats a great present
<Vivix> I walk through walls and fall through the earth
<Vivix> arma is hardly realistic
<Socks> IKR :P
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Ah, but they won't notice it. And the reason is because people are currently too busy BLAMING violent media to realize that it's under attack.
<Snowden> so, How 'Bout them Indie Games?
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: you telling me battlefield is mroe realisitc?
<Vivix> no
<Dark_Horst> see?
<mitamaking> I do wonder why the NRA is in the pocket of the gun manufactors isn't a bigger thing considering he wants more guns
<Vivix> I'm saying netiher are
<CriticKitten> They won't even realize what is being proposed until it's much too late.
<Dark_Horst> it's the most realisitc
<Dark_Horst> not perfect
<Socks> Oh ye gods *facepalms* how long has this been going on!
<Dark_Horst> the closest games get
<GilDash> Oi, I've played UT III and haven't gone on a killing spree once.
<Kandarihu> Randomnerd, while I agree that what LaPierre is abhorrent and cowardly, his organization has a noble cause. I hope he gets replaced at the first opportunity.
<Vivix> Neither are very realistic, and arma is probably not the most realistic due to how many faults it has
<Dark_Horst> se my poitn here
<Dark_Horst> ?
<Casey1859> I
<Bronysith> shooters are not realistic, THE ONLY WAY A SHOOTER CAN BE REALISTIC, is if they make it so that whenever you die the game explodes and you can never play it again, cause there are no respawns in real life
<Vivix> I see what you mean but I don't agree
<pony_2375> no pony is here
<Casey1859> I'm going to take a vote on What is even going on here?
*Socks respawns >_>
<mitamaking> The NRA does not have a noble cause, keeping the 2nd amendment true is noble, the NRA is way past that
<Uakh> the animations in arma give me seizure...
<Vivix> operation flashpoint was great- but then every sequel was buggier than thel ast-
<Snowden> anyone else play To The Moon :(
<Vivix> the last*
<mitamaking> Is the A.I. in this game stupid?
<CriticKitten> And mita: What are you talking about? The NRA decried ALL forms of violent video games recently in public statements
<cachi01> hi everypony :)
<Socks> I got operation flashpoint, I didn't think it was that great :/
<KrazyNoobs> o hai cachi01
<Socks> Hey cachi01
<Snowden> Heyo cachi01
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai cachi01
<CriticKitten> Quote: "And here's another dirty little truth that the media try their best to conceal: There exists in this country a callous, corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows, violence against its own people," the organization claims. "Through vicious, violent video games with names like Bulletstorm, Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat and Splatterhouse."
<Socks> Save us from this discussion!
<Casey1859> That barn-building song was extremely repetitive. Almost like it was geared towards the show's actual target audience..
<KrazyNoobs> dat parachute landing
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, keep in mind that guns are the PRIMARY scapegoat for this shooting. Video games are basically sharing the secondary title with the fact that we haven't forcibly committed mentally imperfect human being in an institution for the rest of their lives.
<Vivix> I played it as a kid, and I liked it, but- yeah
<CriticKitten> LaPierre himself asks "Isn't fantasizing about killing people as a way to get your kicks really the filthiest form of pornography?"
<mitamaking> Well we do need to fix mental institutions
<Uakh> Kandarihu: that's one dangerous train of thought
<cachi01> http://sphotos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/6339_506365482716968_269337674_n.jpg
<CriticKitten> To which I say "no, and you're a buggering idiot for thinking that", but unfortunately that's the minority opinion right now.
<Kandarihu> Uakh, there's been that sort of talk... okay, I guess I'm exaggerating on that. Sorry.
<Uakh> oh nevermind, I thought you were advocading committing "mentally imperfect human being in an institution for the rest of their lives."
<Snowden> cachi01: lulz
<Socks> cachi01: ... I don't get it
<Dark_Horst> CriticKitten: guy needs to see a shrink if you ask me
<Snowden> cachi01: they are conversing about Vidja games and shootings and media
<Kandarihu> BTW, I'm a mentally imperfect person, AND I play violent video games.
<Snowden> so wait a moment
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: That depends on who you ask, though.
<cachi01> Snowden: oh
<Vivix> It's the same conversation as 10 years ago
<cachi01> they are video games
<Vivix> so nothing interesting
<cachi01> they dont do any harm
<Vivix> video games can cause violent tendencies in certain mentalities
<mitamaking> I don't think giving more money to mental health institutes is a bad thing
<Uakh> Kandarihu: according to psychological evaluation, I'm structuraly violent. :D
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Gun control is on the table, but virtually everyone who ISN'T looking at gun control is looking at regulation of violent media instead.
<Socks> Rule 1 - if you are convinced beyond shadow of a doubt that you are completely and utterly right, you are most likely wrong.
<Vivix> and have been known to be cited as motivation by killers
<Uakh> I blame video games >_>
<Socks> :D
<Kimori> hi
<Stormy`> hey
<CriticKitten> So it's a STRONG second place.
*Socks likes Uakh
<Snowden> Uakh: Do you have any interest working with Fox News?
<cachi01> >someone killed someone
<CriticKitten> Too much, in fact.
<Socks> A lot O.O
<cachi01> >blame mario
<Socks> I blame Nintendo, those brothal running basterds
<Uakh> Snowden: hey, why the hay not ?
<mitamaking> the Newton, Ct shooting literally could not have been stopped by anything, my main thing is stopping the one that can be, the domestic arguments, the assault weapon ones, etc..
<Kandarihu> We need to start calling our congresspeople. And we need to be more habitual about it.
<Kimori> how goes?
<Uakh> as long as I'm paid well enough I can advocade anything tbh
<CriticKitten> Oh, and for bonus points.... >NRA decries violent video games; >NRA created an FPS
<Snowden> actually, in the original Super Mario game, all the brick and ? blocks where cursed toads...
<Snowden> so...
<Snowden> yeah...
<CriticKitten> Just rub that hypocrisy in a little deeper
<Uakh> I could probably work for the MPAA / RIAA / NRA / FOX if they paid me
<Stormy`> pretty good, you?
*Socks would work for Fox for the lolz
<Socks> Snowden: And mario hasn't done anything to fix them
<Dark_Horst> maybe i should make sure my harddrive is filled with teletubbies, hello kitty and city building simulators
<Dark_Horst> then i'll go on a rampgae
<Uakh> Socks: that's funny because there's an internal war raging on at fox news between the pro and anti gun regulation
<cachi01> Dark_Horst: what about barbie
<Kandarihu> You know, I hear that Bill O'Reilly is standing in defense of video games.
<Dark_Horst> let's see who they're gonna scapegoat then
<Socks> XD
<CriticKitten> That would be interesting, considering he's been vocally against them in the past....
*Socks could probably get a news job in america just because of his "Sexy" accent
<cachi01> look at all dem stormtroopers
<Vivix> I would probably never st foot in america
<Uakh> Socks: what kind of accent ?
<Bronysith> Vivix: thats okay
<Socks> A british one :P
<Bronysith> Vivix: ill come to you : D
<Vivix> yees
<Uakh> naïce
<tak025> :D
<Uakh> I have a fancy accent. Or so I'm told.
<Socks> Uakh: Where u from? What is your accent? :P
<Kimori> doing ok thanks
<Uakh> fancy
<Snowden> Uakh: like, Eskimo Fancy?
<Socks> *jiggles eyebrows*
<Kandarihu> You know where the logic in scapegoating video games breaks down? On the morning before Christmas, a 61-year-old man set fire to his house and several houses around his and then gunned down the firefighters who responded. Most people that age aren't gamers. Do we start censoring books along with video games?
<Dark_Horst> my accent usually sounds like someone beat my face in recently
<cachi01> fancy aint country i've heard of
<cachi01> do they speak english in fancy?
<CriticKitten> Nonsense, Kandarihu. It was those damn comic books.
<Snowden> cachi01: what?
<CriticKitten> And the rock music.
<Phase4> cachi01, ENGLISH [censored] DO YOU SPEAK IT!
<CriticKitten> And the televisions
<Uakh> the one on the right : http://img135.imageshack.us/img135/3923/applebloomcmsr.jpg
<Snowden> Old peaople, LOVE dubstep, its a proven fact
<CriticKitten> So we may as well censor everything just to be safe
<CriticKitten> :D
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, I was thinking the kind of books that have ONLY words in it.
<Phase4> cachi01, ygotas quote? i think he might have got it from somewhere else
<CriticKitten> I know, I'm taking the piss from the common anti-VG argument. :P
<Uakh> Socks: I'm standing on the other side of the channel >_>
<CriticKitten> Video games aren't the cause, just the newest scapegoat of the bunch
<Kandarihu> Phase4, that's a reference to Pulp Fiction, I think.
<cachi01> Phase4: pulp ifction
<Socks> Uakh: So.... Hows the weather?
<Phase4> ah
<cachi01> fiction
<cachi01> lel
<Phase4> i've not seen that movie
<Vivix> pulp fiction violated surf music-
*Socks wants to see pulp fiction
<Uakh> decent atm...usually quite rainy
<Socks> It's ok around here too
<Uakh> tfw you live in Bordeaux and can't stand alcohol
<Socks> Well... it's 2:30, this has kept me very entertained and I've made a new friend with Uakh. Bye now :)
<cachi01> so this game is like CoD or what?
<Dark_Horst> cachi01: no. this game is fun
<cachi01> lol
<Dark_Horst> also modded
<cachi01> yeah i wanna get it for pc
<cachi01> i had the console version but I WANT MODS
<Randomnerd> I love having two jobs -or rather, the money from two jobs- I can't believe I'm getting laid off from one job after Christmas.
<Uakh> Phase4: new sweetsong post !asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf
<Randomnerd> Well, by New Year's, I mean.
<cachi01> bacon: 100m
<Dark_Horst> DRUGS!
<cachi01> YAY
<Dark_Horst> DRUGS IN THE BUSHES!
*Bronysith takes Dark_Horst to bed
<Dark_Horst> no you dont
<Uakh> drugs are bad mkay ? (unless your local dealer is a good guy and doesn't cut his crap to oblivion with chemical waste)
<cachi01> pew pew pew boom
<Kandarihu> Drugs are bad mkay ? (unless you have a prescription from a liscenced doctor)
<Kandarihu> (for the drug you're taking of course)
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> does anyone know?
<Dark_Horst> see, toher games would've given you an ammo supply or a heating bar for this gatling
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> about cynder and the beam
<Dark_Horst> this game just wants you to have fucking fun with it
<Uakh> best domain name ever : http://www.lesbianspacepirates.com/
<cachi01> whaaaaaaaat
<cachi01> i dont want to click on that
<Kandarihu> Neither do I
<Uakh> it's actually legit sfw
<Kimori> beam?
<Kandarihu> And Uakh, there's a stream going on.
<Dark_Horst> you dirty liars
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> yeah when cynder was corrupted
<Stormy`> nu-uh
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> how'd that process go about?
<Dark_Horst> well, this is an image link
<Dark_Horst> only non image links are prohibited
<Stormy`> they probably never decided
<Stormy`> it was probably just a thing that happened
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> actually is a site link with images in it
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> i mean i wonder if they used the beam each time
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> like with dark spyro
<Uakh> :<
<Uakh> didn't mean to offend, sowwy
*Uakh checks out the stream
<Casey1859> Heavy weapons guy.
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> thats why i wish they'd do legend of cynder
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> i wanna see her backstory
<Dark_Horst> heavy would WISH he was that awesome
<Stormy`> No thank you for that
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> why?
*Stormy` does not like Cynder
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> oh
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> shes not bad
<Stormy`> She is a Mary Sue
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> shes better than ember
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> i never liked her
<Kimori> Id have to disagree with you there Stormy, I'm a fan of Cynder :)
<Stormy`> Ember wasn't a main character though
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> still
<Stormy`> she's not supposed to be likeable
<Stormy`> and is meant to be annoying
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> Ember is my least fav female character
<Kimori> oh yeah Ember sort of like disappeared from the spyro series
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> and what about Cynder is bad
<Kimori> its a shame
<cachi01> dat lesbian webpage crashed mah google chrome
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> i agree with u there kimori
<Kimori> There just isnt enough females in the game
<Stormy`> because her appearance was meant to be a joke
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> who cynder?
<Stormy`> No, ember
<Kimori> But you can play as Ember in the spyro game
<Kimori> if you get all the eggs
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> oh u can?
<Kimori> yep
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> what about flame?
<Kimori> flame?
<Stormy`> She still has Spyro's voice though
<Stormy`> XD
<Stormy`> And yeah, you can be Flame too
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> flame
<SpyroSucksMethsD> Hey
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> hes the red dragon
<Stormy`> Ew Meth
<Kimori> You should play Spyro a heros tail
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> eww
<Stormy`> chang your name please
<Kimori> lol Stormy
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> i own it
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> but im selling it
<Stormy`> *change
*cachi01 slaps chat
<Kimori> yeah Meth
<cachi01> wake up
<Kimori> :/
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> the game gave me trouble
<Stormy`> Lol uh
<Stormy`> maybe I should tell him about /nick
<Stormy`> :P
<Kandarihu> Man, I remember when I was still using the default embedded client, and anything it detects as a link that DOESN'T start with a valid transfer protocol crashed my flash.
<Kimori> NO
<Kimori> this is better :)
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> only thing i dislike about Cynder was her boss form
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> it took me forever
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> to beat her
<Kimori> yeah it was tough
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> i died soooooo much
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> steam was easier
<Dark_Horst> never had abny problems like that
<Kandarihu> And that typing out MLP: FiM without the spaces created such a killer link.
<Stormy`> Evil Cynder is best Cynder
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> and i suck at dodging
<Stormy`> the little Cynder was just boring
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> elemental dragon was easier
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> than cynder
<Stormy`> but big Cynder was actually kind of cool
<cachi01> MLP:FIM?
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> everytime i hear Big Cynder talk i think susie
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> from rugrats
<Kandarihu> cachi01, hmm. Looks like HexChat knows better.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> if you are using the embed chat anything after a ":" becomes a link
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> or numbah 5 from kodename kids next door
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and since ":" is not valid it crashes
<twilight_sprinkle> lawl that link killed lightIRC
<Stormy`> I never liked either of those shows lol
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> how did cynder get the holes in her wings?
<Stormy`> were they all the same voice actress?
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> yep
<cachi01> lel didnt killed it for me
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> cree summer
<twilight_sprinkle> usually the : links just send me to an emty tab
<cachi01> ^
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> shes also on danny phantom
<Stormy`> Never seen that show
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> as valarie grey
<twilight_sprinkle> but this time it killed my lightirc
<Stormy`> hm
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> the girl that voices cynder in eternal night
<CCharmanderK> Oh cool, a stream!
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> voices rose
<CCharmanderK> Who'
<Kandarihu> And yet HexChat knows better
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> in american dragon jake long
<CCharmanderK> Dammit
<Kandarihu> CCharmanderK, Shizuka playing Just Cause 2
<Dark_Horst> i like this micheal bay eject
<Kimori> I use to watch that show
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> and christina ricci well shes
<Stormy`> Me too
<CCharmanderK> Yay, Shizustream! :)
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> meh
<Stormy`> that show was pretty good
<Kandarihu> ...that truck just despawned.
<Kimori> I still have the episodes
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> agreed
<Kimori> saved somewhere..
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> i love that show
<Stormy`> My parents blocked CN though haha
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> i love fu dog
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> hes so funny
<Stormy`> Or was it Disney
<Stormy`> I don't remember
<Kimori> CN sucks nowadays
<DRHUnleashed> boom

<Spyrorocks> If I was really daring I could let people take control of it over the internet
<Dark_Horst> killer nose
<Stormy`> brb, mom wants to talk to me
<Stormy`> that would be fun o.o
<CCharmanderK> Rainbow Dash would be Red Penguin Sillypaws
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> agreed
<Spyrorocks> But if someone crashes it ill kill you.
<Spyrorocks> or if someone flew it into someone else...
<CCharmanderK> WOW, those civillians suck at reacting.
<Spyrorocks> you could easily kill someone with it.
<CCharmanderK> This looks like a game I could get into. :)

<Gaige> its insane
<Dark_Horst> and thats why we love it
<Gaige> yep
<soulrider95> oh this game hahahaha. I love it
<CCharmanderK> If Michael Bay ever gets the rights to adapt any games into film, they should only be Just Cause and Duke Nukem.
<Shizuka> well we reached the point where the AI is broken
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Seeds of Kindness 2 - Piles of Updates
<soulrider95> Just Nukem 3?
<CCharmanderK> ESPECIALLY Duke Nukem.
<Uakh> Shizuka: broken ?
<soulrider95> Duke Cause?
<Shizuka> after an hour or so the traffic stops spawning
<Shizuka> makes for a very dead world
<Kandarihu> CCharmanderK, I don't see Duke Nukem working in Michael Bay's style.
<CCharmanderK> Explosions, aliens, sex and swearing? Duke's got Michael Bay written all over it.
<Shizuka> double check hikari is running..
<Uakh> Kandarihu: CoD then perhaps ?
<Shizuka> um... wtf why is ftb trying to load voxel box now...
<Shizuka> multiMC it is
<CCharmanderK> Shizuka, is "Shizuka Kamishima" your real name or just an intenet alias?
<Shizuka> it is my name
<CCharmanderK> Huh. Okay, I've been wondering that for a while.
<Shizuka> moment while multiMC imports the instance
<CCharmanderK> Thanks for putting that question to rest.
<Shizuka> music is coming through ja?
<CCharmanderK> Yep.
<Spyrorocks> Im designing a lighter tricopter for flying first person
<CCharmanderK> Music is coming through in all its ambient glory.
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> poor cynder
<Spyrorocks> fun flying with a small camera and live video
<EricChristianOlsenFanatic> getting beat by spyro
<Shizuka> hopefully multimc doesn't break anything...
<CCharmanderK> Shizucraft time!
<CCharmanderK> Yep, I do.
<CCharmanderK> That moment when you're the only one talking in chat. :I
<Stormy`> If someone crashes it you'll kill me?
<CCharmanderK> Oh look, random hole in the ground
<Stormy`> what if it's not me who crashes it?
<CCharmanderK> IT'S THE FLYING SHIZU

<KrazyNoobs> CCharmanderK: That was part of my leg, you know?
<CCharmanderK> :3
<CCharmanderK> DAMMIT!
<CCharmanderK> Your leg tastes good. :3
<CCharmanderK> Can I have more?
<KrazyNoobs> I prefer my arms. They have more of a sweet and salty taste
<CCharmanderK> Ew.

<Spyrorocks> and basically impossible to find if you crash it in the forest around here

<penguin> Eli: i don't even like raisins. thats horrible
<Eli> penguin: same
<adasdad> Sketch_Toku_Brony: mage, with a magic claymore and light armor
<Stallion_of_War> Eli: Indeed, I just fail to see the wisdom in the only people being armed to be criminals; a psychopath with a knife is far morre dangerous to public safety than a law abiding citizen with 40 AK-47's; and personally I resent being called a criminal because of the acts of a few insane people,. The acts of a few don't justify condeming all - IE WWII Japanese interment camps.
<JRP2234> Saturn WHAT THE SHIT DID YOU LINK ME

<JRP2234> loading times on the wii u blops 2 are 1223123 times slower than xbox eg. loading muiltiplayer = 3-4 seconds .wii u around 10 - 20 seconds

<Rex_Mundi> heh everypony
<JRP2234> some loser just added me
<penguin> no seriously the fuck are you building
<JRP2234> :P
<Stallion_of_War> Not completly, not without going into a debate about the issue of morality and choice, but for the sake of keeping the peace, /endrant
<Heated> I don't I'm just asking, Bro
<Uakh> MirrorImage: heaters gonna heat
<MirrorImage> i'm just messing with ya
<Heated> Yeah, Bro

<Stallion_of_War> Oi, I said i was done...
<JRP2234> my wii u froze
<JRP2234> also black ops 2 is very buggy
<cachi01|phone> K JRP i already added u :)
<Shizuka> that's what happens when the file is from ages ago when mp3 was new
<JRP2234> and also 0on the xbox version
<penguin> mm, thats some good music. lol
<JRP2234> ive gotten a runtime error a entiti error ect
<Buytoast> The only bug I see is that you bought Black Ops 2.
<MirrorImage> Buytoast - sounds like a Fatal Error
<Buytoast> Nah
<Buytoast> He was dead inside already if he paid for it
<Stallion_of_War> The Weird Al version of this song is greta.
<Heated> Who's the guy or girl in the stream? Whys he hate me?
<Stallion_of_War> *great
<penguin> i got hot chocolate, its snowing like a mother****** out side and then this music comes on and i like it
<cachi01|phone> Wtf internet provider y u suddenly slow?
<Stallion_of_War> I believe Shizu's streaming
<MirrorImage> cachi01|phone - Comcast/
<MirrorImage> ?
<cachi01|phone> Mexican comcast
<cachi01|phone> Telmex
<Heated> Why does Shizu hate me then?
<Buytoast> i could think of a few reasons someone would hate you
<MirrorImage> if that analogy is accurate, it explains everything
<Uakh> I'm a terrible person : the more I play Psychonauts the less I like it ;~; The art is fine, I just find the gameplay frustrating (messy combat, bugs everywhere, rushed platforming dev...)
<Buytoast> you're right
<Buytoast> you are a terrible person
<Heated> Then what are a few resons Buytoast?
<Buytoast> you're annoying
<Buytoast> you're a nuisance
<Stallion_of_War> I FIGURED IT OUT! SHE'S BUILDING A THING!
<Heated> How?
<Uakh> I even ran into a bug I could reproduce by accident
<Buytoast> you're a pest
<Buytoast> lemme think of a few more words
<JRP2234> cachi01|phone get out of miiverse
<penguin> hey, why is shit so complicated
<MirrorImage> because Biology?
<Heated> How are those true BUYTOAST!!!!!!!!
<cachi01|phone> JRP But ita fuuun D:
<Dark92Enigma> Heated: i doubt she would hate anypony unless you've done something bad, which i also doubt.
<dreadhoof> I dont think Psychonauts is that great, I mean it is still under rated but, not great
<Heated> pretty much streamer
<Buytoast> i never said those are true
<Uakh> Buytoast: should I kill myself then ? If so, how ?
<Buytoast> i said those are reasons i could think of
<JRP2234> cachi01|phone You got blobs 2 to?
<Stallion_of_War> :D lol blanet
<penguin> more tunes pls
<Buytoast> hold on a second
<Buytoast> i have an image saved soemwhere around ehre
<cachi01|phone> JRP eenope
<cachi01|phone> Just nintendo land, scribblenauts and zombiU
<Stallion_of_War> It's actually an ancient Mayan blanket inbued with the power to end time itself. That's why it's hidden.
<Heated> Person in the stream let us see your Minecraft skin.
<Cypresswolf> Shizu: I thought that lyric was "honestly .... I'm never gonna find your vegas"
<Buytoast> there we are
<Buytoast> http://i.imgur.com/7apzq.png
<Buytoast> be thankful your psychonauts doesn't look like this
<penguin> i figured it out. its a manor
<Stallion_of_War> Cypresswolf: New Vegas or Las Pegasis?
<Cypresswolf> New Pegasis
<Heated> STREAMER let us see your skin please
<Stallion_of_War> I think it's a construct made out of wood, wool and stone, but maybe that's just me.
<Buytoast> then again, if it looks like that it does look pretty bitching
<Stallion_of_War> And glass
<Heated> I think that to
<Stallion_of_War> Now it just needs a garage that's rebuilt slightly more times than the barn at Sweet Apple Acres and a giant robot car.
<Heated> Tell the streamer Heated wants to see his Minecraft skin
<penguin> hey is it possible that pip squeak is vinyl and octavia's child and/or little brother? this is a must know. come on people its for science
<Dark92Enigma> Heated: i for one, say leave her the way she is. Like Dr. Claw. i don't need to see her face
<Dark92Enigma> EXCEPT
<Dark92Enigma> in drawings
<MirrorImage> penguin - where do you get that theory from?
<Dark92Enigma> or vectors
<Heated> Streamer can I see your skin press F5
<Stallion_of_War> Better hope lightning never strikes that place...
<Cypresswolf> I wonder, is there a mod for stained glass windows for minecraft - that would look good for my Redwall project when I get back to it eventually
<Buytoast> how in the hell do you make a canon character out to be the child of a fanon couple
<Buytoast> how
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Heated she already show the skin
<penguin> MirrorImage: that just it. its just a theory. there is no evidence to it being true. theres also no evidence to it being not true
<MirrorImage> Cypresswolf - i know there's mods for Colored Lights
<Dark92Enigma> again, really? :$
<Heated> Whe
<Heated> When
<Buytoast> that is one of the most asshanded fat fetched theories i have ever been exposed to
<MirrorImage> penguin - absense of disproof is not evidence of proof
<MirrorImage> lets not go there
<dreadhoof> what is that red glass?
<Heated> Stanned Glass
<Buytoast> that shitty creepy pasta of the rugrats is more likely than that theory you purged out of your system
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is red and it's glass
<Stallion_of_War> Probably red lamps
<Cypresswolf> I'm thinking....in the Redwall animated series - and I may need to rewatch it to make sure - there may have been stained glass in the Great Hall setting
<penguin> MirrorImage: well be that way, im gonna go further into it and probably get some fanart of it
<Cypresswolf> Perhaps, make a window version of the tapestry
<Stallion_of_War> Minecraft really does need stained glass
<penguin> that old type of rock and roll
<Stallion_of_War> "and then we realized that concrete would proabaly have been a more stable foundation materiallllllll"
<Cypresswolf> nor is building a city on rolling rocks, Shizuka
<Kandarihu> My late aunt might disagree. Then again, she passed away over a decade ago.
<penguin> kind of music that soothes the soul
<Heated> ITS MINECRAFT IT DOESNT MATTER!
<Heated> Stream stopped
<Heated> Is back
<Jazmyn> hey guys am i early
<Heated> Nice skin BRO
<Shizuka> why are you calling me bro
<Shizuka> i am no bro
<Stallion_of_War> Skin looks like a cross between 10th and 11th doctors and Shizu
<Heated> Then what are you?
<penguin> Heated: ha
<penguin> lol
<Heated> SHIZUKA! what are you
<penguin> she is girl fool
<dreadhoof> :D
<Shizuka> http://i.imgur.com/sFd9b.jpg
<Buytoast> holy shit you're like a thick headed parrot
<Buytoast> SQUAK, WHAT ARE YOU
<Heated> Shizuka is a funny name (o offense)
<Stallion_of_War> Still looks a bit like David Tennant and Matt Smith combined
<Heated> Cool skin Mysteryious Being
<Stallion_of_War> Stuck between regenerations
<penguin> Heated: thats so weird. i said the same thing only i called it queer
<penguin> she took offense to it for some reason
<kidzrul732> I'm sleeping with the volume on
<Stallion_of_War> MAKE A BUILDING OUT OF BOMBS!
<Heated> I know I said NO OFFENSE
<Dark92Enigma> Heated: Shizuka means serenity, peace and calm in japanese (correct me if i'm wrong)
<kidzrul732> I'm sleeping so don't wake me up
<Dark92Enigma> and btw, Hellooooooooooo Nurse! <3
<Heated> I saw an ad for the most realistic golf game (LOL)
<Stallion_of_War> I always thought Shizuka ment Moderator of Bronystate that drives the Shizubus in GTA4
<penguin> Dark92Enigma: cool, how the fuck do you know that. are you a... japanese
<Kandarihu> You know what? I don't think I ever heard this song in it's entirety.
<Dark92Enigma> Stallion_of_War: that too :D
<kidzrul732> I'm trying to sleep here
<Buytoast> then go
<Dark92Enigma> LUCAS! darling ;)
<Heated> Nice chimney Shizuka
<Stallion_of_War> History lesson: The Shizubus' predecessor was the Eziohorse
<Stallion_of_War> Trample ALL the pesants!
<Dark92Enigma> penguin: no i'm not.....i know a few words though :$
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu: what was the name of the song?
<Shizuka> Yello - Oh Yeah
<Shizuka> you would all know it from ferris bueller
<Buytoast> fitting
<Stallion_of_War> Which was itself preceeded by the Altairhorse
<Heated> Livestream is live
<penguin> Dark92Enigma: japanese is the bomb
<Stallion_of_War> Bohemian Rhapsody in a foreign language?
<penguin> little high little low
*Stallion_of_War give Shizuka 46 1
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: thank you for reminding me, and double thank you for this BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY version!
<Heated> Shizuka, I like the chimney
<penguin> this is not the song i was thinking
<penguin> oh god i hate red stone
<Stallion_of_War> :D ZEROHEMIAN WINGSODY
<Heated> Sticky Piston sounds nasty
<MirrorImage> dispensers and sticky pistons?
<Heated> Cool
<Cypresswolf> I caught a snipit of a radio questionaire for some concert tickets - the caller was asked to identify the real version of this song - she answered wrong - how does one NOT know Boheimian Rapsody?
<Dark92Enigma> WHAT YOU SAAAAAAY
<penguin> MirrorImage: its gonna have fucking red stone how much you wanna bet
<Cypresswolf> This was a couple weeks ago - right after Thanksgiving
<Dark92Enigma> Cypresswolf: REALLY?
<Stallion_of_War> Cypresswolf: One has a sheltered childhood?
<Dark92Enigma> Cypresswolf: i WON a singing contest with this song, for pony's sake!
<Uakh> Cypresswolf: I don't know bohemian rapsody ;~;
<Heated> Shizuka why you mad at me?
<Dark92Enigma> Heated: i doubt she is
<Cypresswolf> But you know the tune, right Uakh?
<Uakh> no
<Stallion_of_War> For great justice!
<Uakh> never heard it before
<Heated> Is she trolling Me?
<Dark92Enigma> you seem to be obessed Heated
<Dark92Enigma> Heated: nope.
<Stallion_of_War> This song is... O.O
<Heated> Obessed?
<Dark92Enigma> Heated: yes you
<Cypresswolf> :) Uakh, I recommend you watch Wayne's World
<penguin> dance your heart out shizuka
<Dark92Enigma> Nothing really matters.........
<Heated> Whats Obessed mean
<Dark92Enigma> TO Meeeeeeeeee
<Uakh> Cypresswolf: what ?
<Dark92Enigma> Heated: OH, God, it seems you are the troll
<TrixieMuffin> for great justice
<Cypresswolf> I'll link you the scene, Uakh
<Heated> STARBURST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Heated> Its a contadiction
<Uakh> is it bad that since the beggining of the livestream, I don't know any song or even artist ?
<Uakh> music was never my strong point
<Heated> Its only bad if you make it bad
<CrystalPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1356655803248.png
*MirrorImage is hesitant to click that link...
<Dark92Enigma> Heated: Obsessed: To have the mind excessively preoccupied with a single emotion or topic
<Heated> I put it in my mind dictionary thank you :)
<penguin> CrystalPhoenix: that is a great pic
<CrystalPhoenix> MirrorImage, because I'm definitely going to post anything against the rules
<CrystalPhoenix> yeah

<Uakh> CrystalPhoenix: I don't like sweetie belle's mane in this one :-/
<Dark92Enigma> Heated: like you, getting obsessed with Shizuka (why YOU think is she mad at you, you wanting to see her skin, etc, etc)
<Buytoast> fancy
<Dark92Enigma> I'M ON FIYAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Heated> I saw it know I dont care LOL :)

<penguin> Stallion_of_War: o god 0_o
<Stallion_of_War> That's better counting than uno, dose, tres, catorse (pardon my spelling... 1, 2, 3, 14)
<Heated> Is this dubstep?
<JRP2234> http://i.imgur.com/TmhgA.jpg ahhh ma brain is confused
<Buytoast> don't worry, it's fireproof wood
<Stallion_of_War> Fire Hive is good Wubstep
<Buytoast> from Hell itself
<Dark92Enigma> Heated: no :D
<Buytoast> dubstep is terrible
<Heated> I agree
<Stallion_of_War> It's better if someone's singing.
<Heated> Nice Music
<Stallion_of_War> The only thing the fireplace's missing is a nice portrait of Princess Luna :)

<Jmo> He isn't obnoxious to you, cause you're a child.
<Barbetos> yor wards r had to undastnd
<oGriofa> Their funny at first but content gets redundent when you're famous.
<Jmo> You'll find anything funny.
<Heated> Not really
<Barbetos> except this.
<killerpony7733> Heated It's childish to say such you avoid the issue and just try to avoid the argument and the actual critique being shown to you.
<Barbetos> THIS. Is... sort of sad really.
<penguin> so if i were to eat a cat, oh lets sayyyy my cat, it would not be illegal
<oGriofa> Stallion_of_War: I demand to know where I can read this.
<Stallion_of_War> give me a second oGriofa
<Stallion_of_War> http://www.amazon.com/101-Uses-Dead-Simon-Bond/dp/0517545160

<penguin> fuuuuuuu
<killerpony7733> Heated If you can't take critique and resort to saying ''lawl if you don't like it then don't watch'' I actually don't watch him but i have seen some of his stuff and that's where my critique my view on him comes from. Anywho done it's impossible to logic with you
<Stallion_of_War> but that would be bad... and probably hilarious for at least one of us... but bad...
<penguin> Stallion_of_War: do it
<Stallion_of_War> Fortunatly I deleted her address from my computer shortly after we broke up. Keeps me from doing anything stupid.

<Stallion_of_War> It inquired if I was mad. I was more confused as to why I was being insulted by a dancing orange thing.

<penguin> thelonecubone: nah so it probably is a no go huh
<berberborscing> In fact, my beer can do that. Hold me.
<thelonecubone> penguin: do that later then :)
*Saturn 08,01rubs the_real_pony_1604's knee, totally not suggestively
<penguin> berberborscing: lol
<penguin> Saturn: by that you mean sexually right?
<the_real_pony_1604> thanks, feels better. *scoots over a bit away from saturn
<thelonecubone> that is what he means
*berberborscing hey shizuka, where's the panic room of this house?
<Saturn> 08,01penguin: damnit, i said *not* suggestively!
<penguin> lol you can smell the sexual tension
<berberborscing> Smells like M&M cookies... oh wait, that's what I;m cooking.
<penguin> weird im cooking cereal
<Saturn> 08,01penguin: how do you open the door to a lady's heart without the key?
<berberborscing> holy sheit.
<Saturn> 08,01sexual tension wrench.
<berberborscing> with your dick?
<penguin> lol
<oGriofa> Saturn: 101 lockpick skill
<penguin> never heard that one before
<the_real_pony_1604> saturn, thats awesome, berberborscing, thats wrong
<Saturn> 08,01i enjoy lockpicking; i found out the other day that it's a common hobby amongst security professionals
<Saturn> 08,01which isn't surprising
<berberborscing> That's oxymoronic.
<berberborscing> Security = Ensuring privacy
<penguin> Saturn: your gonna become a common street thug. good for you
<berberborscing> Lockpicking = not
<penguin> :)
<oGriofa> Saturn: well, you can lockpick my heart anytime <3
<Saturn> 08,01berberborscing: security and privacy, while linked, are not the same thing
<the_real_pony_1604> I know how to break into all of the cars I own. it is one of the first things I research after buying it
<berberborscing> Great, now im confused.
<Saturn> 08,01berberborscing: anyway, you don't necessarily need to break into anyon'es private stuff to practice
<berberborscing> k.
<Saturn> 08,01i generally just practice on lock barrels i buy off ebay
<penguin> oGriofa: coming on a little strong there man. try a first date then use that line
<berberborscing> First date: my new car
<Ryunosuke> privacy is having people not know what you are doing, security is eliminating others from accessing your files and computer
<oGriofa> penguin: your right, need to ue my lady manners.
<the_real_pony_1604> give me enough time and I can get into any master lock brand combo locks
<penguin> berberborscing: knows whats up
<Saturn> 08,01pfft, oGriofa can come on to me as strong as they want
<berberborscing> I tuned a BMW M3 in prostreet. Goes 0-60 in 20 seconds. Yeahhhh
<Saturn> 08,01she can come on to me stronger than old stilton
<Saturn> 08,01which is the sexiest cheese.
<oGriofa> Saturn: Well then, i can be your lady friend for the night ;D as long as your ok with me not being a lady
<penguin> Saturn: you were just complaining about being hit on or being flirted with
<penguin> make up you mind
<Saturn> 08,01it has antibacterial properties! what can be more sexy than that?!
<Ryunosuke> an easy way to break locks... Freon + hammer :)
<berberborscing> Hand sanitizer
<Saturn> 08,01oGriofa: that is fine
<Saturn> 08,01penguin: when did i complain about that?
<oGriofa> Saturn: Ill make arrangements for "blast off"
<penguin> not to long ago actually

<berberborscing> Chat: Giving Shizuka 1 of Gravel.
<thelonecubone> oGriofa: Oh my~
<Saturn> 08,01oGriofa: disappointed that that wasn't a cheese pun, but i'll take it
<penguin> something about pigeons
<Ryunosuke> Saturn: but it was a ... Gouda pun :)
<oGriofa> Saturn: Sorry cheese puns are against my religion.
<penguin> oh god the puns
<berberborscing> dafuq?
<penguin> kill meeeee:[
<Saturn> 08,01penguin: oh, that. the point of that was more that i didn't like people using me as the "token gay", expecting me to hit on everyone
<Ryunosuke> penguin, dont feel... bleu :)
<thelonecubone> penguin: nope
<thelonecubone> :>
<the_real_pony_1604> what are these x-mass colored pipes I am seeing?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> the feels
<penguin> ga i give up with this symbolic bull shit

<texasboykc09> Shizuka, what went wrong
<berberborscing> Tekkit is what I'll call it. Feed-The-Beast is a way too long name.
<berberborscing> It took me 15 minutes to write that.
<berberborscing> Yeah.
<the_real_pony_1604> just use FTB, I will know
<berberborscing> Tekkit is T!
<penguin> the_real_pony_1604: no tekkit is awesome and interesting. this is boring as hell

<TheRandomkid321> Listen, I need to get this off my blooded chest, yell at me, kick me, hell even ban me if you will. But does anyone else honestly get a bit sick of Wrek at times?
<Saturn> 08,01i've not idea where it is
<penguin> really
<killerpony7733> berberborscing Fun fact i am a born greenlander and i got citizenship there. Lived most of my life there.
<Saturn> 08,01berberborscing: on this planet?
<legendary_brony> hai

<Saturn> 08,017, i think

<Saturn> 08,01geography isn't something i'm all that good at
<penguin> iwouldn't touch that place with a 20 yard pole

<berberborscing> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uBcq1x7P34
<killerpony7733> Saturn Having two citizenships is awesome
<twilight_sprinkle> nope nvm :D
<Shizuka> seven, North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, Antarctica
<Saturn> 08,01killerpony7733: i can't have dual citizenship, because india doesn't allow it
<killerpony7733> Saturn One for greenland where i was born. The other for denmark where my parents and blood come from.
<killerpony7733> Awww
<Saturn> 08,01so i just chose to have british
<Shizuka> as far as actual landmasses go though, it's America, Eurasia, Africa, Australia, Antarctica
<TheRandomkid321> I should leave before I do something I'll regret.
<berberborscing> But...
<berberborscing> Afro-Eurasia!
<killerpony7733> Saturn I think mine goes as simple as ''You have by right of birth and blood to live in greenland and denmark if you so choose.''
<twilight_sprinkle> but what about americo-afro-eurasia
<thelonecubone> Ohai Sprunkls :3
<twilight_sprinkle> hai tehlonpot
<berberborscing> Is Australia large enough to be a continent? Or king of the islands?
<killerpony7733> Saturn Think it's two sided too since greenland is still under the danish flag but more indepedent
<twilight_sprinkle> australia is a continent
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<thelonecubone> ^^
<killerpony7733> Saturn So dual citizen yay
<AdamTheDuck> and the largest island iirc
<AdamTheDuck> >.> I got a new song stuck in my head
<AdamTheDuck> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-jk6Ftx7o

<Afflict> yeah
<berberborscing> New answer to how many continents there are!
<NocturnalBlade> i got this song in my head ^_^ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1pjmN3RF3c
<Amu-chan> Hi. XD
<berberborscing> A: How many do you want there to be?
<Afflict> what's up?
<penguin> berberborscing: you ass. i just watched that entire video about contiantaiatants
<Amu-chan> Installing Linux on this other computer I set up in my room.
<berberborscing> lol
<TheRandomkid321> I don't know why but... I mjust really dislike Wrek. I mean I'll tell it to him straight up and all and I think he doesn't like me back but he just really irritates me at times. And now I'm going to have a shitwave coming towards me because heaven forbid someone dislike a moderator although it's fine if they are just regulars.
<penguin> can't fucking spell so i gave up
<AdamTheDuck> D:
<Jmo> Poor diddums.
<Jmo> Welcome to life, leave your tears in a bottle on your way out.
<Afflict> cool
<AdamTheDuck> But Wrek... Wrek is so huggable... :<
<Panda> TheRandomkid321, no fucks were given.
<berberborscing> Saturn is more huggable. Obviously.
<pyrocatboy> duh
<TheRandomkid321> Jmo I'm getting pretty blooded sick of your attitude.
<penguin> TheRandomkid321: so for no reason at all you dislike a person you have never even personally met. good job
<Jmo> If you don't like him, just ignore him.
<Jmo> Simple.
<Panda> TheRandomkid321, says the one who opened up with a rant about someone who isnt here.
<Ninjazz> http://i.imgur.com/v84p9.jpg
<berberborscing> Alright guys split it up
<TheRandomkid321> I'm not ranting I'm letting off steam.
<pyrocatboy> no
<berberborscing> We don't need there to be a full scale fight now
<pyrocatboy> this is entertaining
<Panda> ^
<AdamTheDuck> XD
<berberborscing> Love and tolerance?
<Jmo> Wrek is Wrek, you have a problem with that, you consult him about it.
<pyrocatboy> no
<Ninjazz> Naj.
<penguin> TheRandomkid321: using what i said agianst me to get me to back off. well played
<berberborscing> You guys deal with this,
<berberborscing> I'll be in my room.
<legendary_brony> *snore*
<Saturn> 08,01fun facT: when i originally came on bronystate, i was scared of wrek, and thought he didn't like me
<penguin> TheRandomkid321: still doesn't explain your assholeish behavior
<Saturn> 08,01now he's one of my best friends on here, and we even ended up in bed together during BUCK
<twilight_sprinkle> penguin: you're actually being more rude than him
<TheRandomkid321> I know wrek is wrek but he just seems so angry all the time. Quite frankly I fear him, yes I fear him. I feel as though you can be banned so easily by him.
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, t'is only natural to fear the Wrek in his habitat
<berberborscing> I got on a server of Minecraft and a guy named Chaos said "Get off my land, and I'll kick you from server unless you pay me 10,000 for trespassing"
<Jmo> You fear a person over the internet.
<Jmo> Bravo.
<Buytoast> Wrek don't seem that bad if you aint a dumbass
<Panda> TheRandomkid321, angry? Because his text is red?
<penguin> twilight_sprinkle: well twilight, he started it so bleh
<Ninjazz> What Buytoast said.
<killerpony7733> Buytoast Exactly.
<TheRandomkid321> No because of what he has said.
<Saturn> 08,01Jmo: i think you're missing the point
<Phase4> berberborscing, so, did you get off his land?
<penguin> im so mature
<Jmo> What point?
<Jmo> Please do tell Saturn.
<AdamTheDuck> Buytoast, most indeed
<TheRandomkid321> I'm not a fucking dumbass!
<berberborscing> Obviously not.
<Phase4> berberborscing, did he kick you?
<Saturn> 08,01Jmo: that my view of him changed
<pyrocatboy> yes you are
<Panda> TheRainbowDusk, you are.
<Jmo> I wasn't talking about you Saturn.
<Saturn> 08,01oh
<berberborscing> In fact, I built a Rainbowdash pixel art there while he was afk
<Saturn> 08,01well someone should be.
<Phase4> XD
*Panda licks Saturn
<penguin> oh shit its like the murey show in chat right now
<Jmo> You're proving to be one kiddo.
<legendary_brony> whats this? a war? .....*gets popcorn*
*Saturn 08,01licks Panda back
<twilight_sprinkle> well, it does sometimes feel like wrek tries to get people to say something to get kicked for
<Panda> \:3/
<pyrocatboy> Yoour a bigger idiot than my brother TheRandomkid321, and thats saying something.
<TheRandomkid321> Well fuck you. I'm sorry but I really don't need this right now.
<Panda> twilight_sprinkle, its up to you to say it. You cant blame your words on someone else.
<pyrocatboy> *your

*SuperBrony64 licks Saturn as well ;3;
<berberborscing> the CMC made a fucking rocket shuttle...
<Panda> Like say, I cursed out Saturn. I would be to blame, not him.
*Saturn 08,01asplodes
<TheRandomkid321> Let alone on m,y favorite chatroom I'm fucking hated. Wow.
*AdamTheDuck licks SuperBrony64 who is licking Saturn
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O3O
<penguin> who cares, wrek has power to boot people. of course hes gonna mis use it
<penguin> who the fuck wouldn't
<Saturn> 08,01it's lick o'clock
<SuperBrony64> 11,02pyrocatboy: Don't call someone an idiot :/
<Saturn> 08,01whcih is my bedtime
<TheRandomkid321> For speaking my fucking mind. Well that quite frankly seems a bit unfair.
<berberborscing> He's gonna Wrek it!
<pyrocatboy> ok
<Saturn> 08,01night all
<Panda> night Saturn.
<NocturnalBlade> nite Saturn ^_^

<Panda> As does everyone else in school.
<Jmo> Have you tried to kill yourself again?
<Jmo> I really hope not.
<TheRandomkid321> Jmo Fuck you and since you asked, yes I have.
<penguin> TheRandomkid321: well fire him cause hes not doing his job
<Jmo> Great job.
<Buytoast> Boy I should've brought my umbrella for this shitstorm.
*SpeccyRush slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<Ninjazz> http://i.imgur.com/dVYtg.jpg
<berberborscing> I love this song. (Fuck you)
<Jmo> Go pop some more happy pills kiddo.
<TheRandomkid321> It's unfortunate Bobby pins arnt conductive or else I wouldn't be here right now.
<penguin> Buytoast: i got one man
<Panda> Uh... huh. Now the conversation has gotten into suicide.
<legendary_brony> this is cyber bullying
<twilight_sprinkle> TheRandomkid321: perhaps you need some rest?
<pyrocatboy> Buytoast If you did I would just poke holes in it for the lulz.
<legendary_brony> its not good
<TheRandomkid321> I'm well rested. I spoke my fucking mind and now I'm getting shit from all ends. I would expect this on another site but not here.
<Buytoast> Usually we got to wait for the weekend for the chat to turn to shit.
<Saturn> 08,01my god, Jmo and TheRandomkid321, take it to PM before i ban you both
<AdamTheDuck> Buytoast, hehe ikr :$
<pyrocatboy> Welcome to the internet, have a complementary jar of jelly on the way out.
<Jmo> Huh? I'm done.
<Jmo> There is no hope in pursuing it.
<Saturn> 08,01make sure you are.
<TheRandomkid321> Saturn This is no longer just with Jmo.
<penguin> TheRandomkid321: oh for the love of god quit bitching. shit life is tough. quit acting like your the only one suffering. your just a winny little kid no go grow a pair

<Panda> Nope.

<pyrocatboy> Buytoast In your fanfiction they do.
<berberborscing> Describe a unicorn car
<TheRandomkid321> Wow, just wow... I remember this was once a nice site I could enjoy. Now I'm going to leave now. And before I do I just want to tell you to look up cyber bullying sometime.

<aniderp|bestcakeever> i feel like i lost my happy side ;_;
<mk_cactus> Gonna play LoL so bye for a few minutes...
<Gold_Demona> What? Because you're depressed? Seriously? That's you're logic behind having to purposely eat something that will certainly make you sick?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Why am I on bronystate at 4:40 in the morning?
<pyronoobboy> aniderp|bestcakeever You must have encountered a Dementor
<Gold_Demona> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Wow! Somebody who's further west than me and is up at the same time as me XD
<aniderp|bestcakeever> all it would do is close my throat a bit then i would need water/..

<KrazyNoobs> Hi everypony?
<SlenderManWoods> hi
<Uboa-San> KrazyNoobs: Hello!
<KrazyNoobs> I am down by 60 IQ points after spending an hour on /mlp/,,,
<alexxm> how are things KrazyNoobs
<KrazyNoobs> Well, I'm happy I'm here.
<SlenderManWoods> lol, crippple him
<pegashy> ...
<SlenderManWoods> i wonder what that fruit taste like
<pegashy> hi everypony.
<SlenderManWoods> hi
<pegashy> what is this...
<SlenderManWoods> fallout
<SlenderManWoods> 3
<Uboa-San> Fallout New Vegas
<pegashy> yep, this pegasister doesnt know anything about that xD
<SlenderManWoods> realy?
<pyrocatboy> I'm back
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im dying
<pegashy> well, my bro is a famous brony artist i guess because of his subscribers
<pegashy> and he loves to play games
<pegashy> probably he knows about all of this
<SlenderManWoods> in fallout 3, i hate going to that neighborhood full of caniballs, at least i saved the children
<KrazyNoobs> I can do pony art okay, but the legs always look awkward.
<pyrocatboy> Yes there is, and it regularly destroys Tokeo.
<pegashy> does someone know spectradash anyway? xD
<aniderp|bestcakeever> guess what time it is ;_;
<SlenderManWoods> wat
<aniderp|bestcakeever> work
<SlenderManWoods> 5:55 here
<pyrocatboy> wat o' clock?
<SlenderManWoods> yes
<aniderp|bestcakeever> bai ;_;
<pegashy> my bro once made ''my little skyrim'' (ytpmv)
<SlenderManWoods> bai freind
<KrazyNoobs> pegashy: SpectraDash is your brother?
<pegashy> yep?
<KrazyNoobs> :O
<pegashy> ...
<SlenderManWoods> i wonder wat movies we will watch today
<pegashy> it's nothing special..
<Jmo> Neither are you with your attention seeking.
<SlenderManWoods> i loved last weaks movies
<pegashy> wait what?
<pegashy> I was just talking with someone..
<Jmo> Sorry, do you need me to repeat?
<pyrocatboy> That B movie made me groan by just looking at the picture.
<KrazyNoobs> Jmo: She just is asking, she isn't boasting about it or anything.
<Jmo> So screaming 'Hey my brother is famous and I'm her sister' isn't boasting or seeking attention.
<Jmo> I can really see your head is screwed on right.
<Jmo> Bravo.
<Jmo> his*
<pegashy> "love & tolerate"
<Buytoast> AHAHAHA
<pyrocatboy> Jmo Go to sleep, you sound cranky
<Buytoast> But he is right you know.
<Jmo> Shush newfoal.
<Jmo> Love and tolerate is the joker card of the brony deck.
<Wrek> 05whatever guise
<SlenderManWoods> yep
<pegashy> I only wanted to know if anyone knew my brother..
<pyrocatboy> Jmo What did you just call me?
<pegashy> that's it.
<Buytoast> But I do have a question
<Buytoast> Why are there suddenly indians in Fallout?
<pyrocatboy> DLC
<Jmo> I called you an orangutang, what do you think?
<Wrek> 05Jmo stop being cranky pyrocatboy drop it aswell
<KrazyNoobs> Jmo: There is a difference between asking if anyone knows and bragging about it. She said, "My brother is a famous brony, do any of you know about him". IF she said, "Hey, I'm the little sister of THE SpectraDash", that would have been attention seeking.
<pyrocatboy> Wrek ok
<Wrek> 05pegashy no i dont know your brother
<KrazyNoobs> Wrek: One of his YTPMVs is shown here before every new episode.
<Buytoast> Who cares
<SlenderManWoods> wait, do you hear that....hush...now...quiet...now, oh god run
<Jmo> Oh Americans.
<Wrek> 05oh and KrazyNoobs stop fueling the file
<Wrek> 05fire*
<KrazyNoobs> Wrek: I am just trying to be nice. :(
<pyrocatboy> Jmo Oh Europeans. Ok I'll shut up now
<pegashy> okay... didn't expect my first visit in 3 months would be like this..?
<Wrek> 05be what?
<Wrek> 05late night any everyoens a bit cranky? :p
<Jmo> Not even cranky :I
<wipergone2> hi Wrek
<pyrocatboy> pegashy Welcome back to the Internet.
<Wrek> 05jmo you're always cranky
<pegashy> it's 3 pm in here lol
<SlenderManWoods> not cranky here
<Jmo> Thanks for the comment darling.
<pyrocatboy> 9:05 am
<Buytoast> Well perhaps you shouldn't of joined the chat talking about your famous relative when it had nothing to do with anything going on at that moment.
<wipergone2> Jmo: hi
<Buytoast> But that's just me.
<SlenderManWoods> 6:05 am here
<wipergone2> ded
<SlenderManWoods> damn bugs
<pegashy> well, just forget about that, okay? a 12 yr old with a jaw inflammation doesn't really deserve this right...
<Buytoast> so is this whole DLC thing just Indians and wolves?
<Jmo> This chat is 14+, if you're 12 you shouldn't be here.
<Buytoast> It's true.
<SlenderManWoods> ded
<pyrocatboy> Does anypony else just love putting black pepper (The kind in shakers) on pizza?

<pegashy> but weird... :/
<NekoC> pegashy: thx
<pyrocatboy> Wrek unpauses and we see a Gecko's head being shot. Classy.
<Meanwhile> Exploding gecko heads are the epitome of class.
<Lil_B> at least it will be time soon to use the only chinese sentences I know, for new year :)
<NekoC> Lil_B: I actually found an emote for Happy New Year
<pyrocatboy> Meanwhile And you would know that, being the very definition of classy, huh?
<NekoC> Lil_B: do you want me to post it?
<Lil_B> NekoC everybody is happy on new year, I might as well just use :) or : D
<NekoC> :):):)
<Buytoast> I'm sure somwehre this situation would be considered ironic.
<NekoC> Buytoast: which situation?
<Meanwhile> Of course, I don't go anywhere without my exploded gecko head. Why just last week I attended a delightful swaray with a fantastic exploded gecko head centerpiece.
<pyrocatboy> I think Wrek saw my post, because he tipped the park ranger's hat
<NekoC> Meanwhile: *applauds*

<pegashy> it's 3:38 in the afternoon
<Ninjazz> New Vegas had a comical undertone to it. F3 had a pretty serious and depressing tone that help immerse you in a post-apoclyptic nightmare. NV had better gameplay over all though.
<NekoC> TheRandomkid321: *get *apology

<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: that's your opinion and you may go buy yourself a sandwich of it
<Dark_Horst> seriously, it gets annoying
<Scoot-Scootaloo> HEY
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Stop arguing about fanfiction, no matter how important and life threatening it is
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Okay? m'kay :$
<wipergone2> Scoot-Scootaloo: hi
<Dark_Horst> we're not arguing, scoots
<Dark_Horst> it's bronysith
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Even so
<Dark_Horst> that's his normal converstaion tone
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Stahp
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: sorry T~T
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: still better than 50 shades of grey or twilight
<Bronysith> those 3 are the longest fanfictions in the world
<Dark_Horst> ....i dont remember the holo rifle being that effective when i played it
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: the holo rifle was...meh
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: dont you even dare mention those
<wipergone2> lol
<Dark_Horst> but yeah
<Dark_Horst> holo rifle was useless
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: i know, but those 3 hold the record for longest fanfictions
<Dark_Horst> and i played this one after old world blues, so i had my energy weapons skill up
<Dark_Horst> also, does lenght now translate to bad?
<Bronysith> i didnt like old world blues
<Bronysith> it was hilarious as fuck though
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: overrated =/= bad
<Bronysith> chrono trigger, final fantasy 7 are some of my fav games of all time and they are completely overrated as all shit...love them to death though
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: and fallout equestria is a great fanfiction
<Dark_Horst> you're throwing the word overrated around a little crelessy
<Ponies47> ^
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: saying the word overrated is overrated
<Dark_Horst> so why dont you cut down on it?
<Ponies47> He thinks everything is overrated Dark_Horst
<Bronysith> cause cutting down on it is overrated
<Dark_Horst> if we were playing planetside right now, i'd shoot you in the back o0
<Lil_B> I think our rating systhems need to get adjusted, everything is too overrated
<Rocket> Bronysith xD
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: sorry, ill stop T~T

<Lil_B> level grinding~~~
*Rocket >implying that Twilight is best pony
*Bronysith carries Dark_Horst away in apology
<Bronysith> Rocket: um, she kinda is...
<Rocket> Bronysith but she overrating everything :D
<Bronysith> jechts voice in final fantasy is so....sexy
<Ponies47> Rocket, Twilight is cool. But Fluttershy is mah favorite :3
<Bronysith> fluttershy gets way too much love
<Bronysith> she is a selfish fuckign bitch
<Rocket> XD
<Rocket> Ponies47 i cant decide betwen RD and TS

<Ponies47> Rocket, TS. RD is THE MOST overrated pony outta all of them
<Rocket> Ponies47 youre right

<MahBoi777> hey fillyfillyy!
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: The True Reason for the Season / Spitfire's Tough Choice
<Applesjack> Halo Wars stuff, awesome fer the afternoon.
<MadSurge> DAT WILHELM

<Dark_Horst> oh hai wilhelm
<Dtox> did anyone get any ponies for chrismas :)?
<RaveBrony> Lol

*fillyfillyy hugs MahBoi777 "HAY!"
<Scoot-Scootaloo> ...PONIES?
<MLP_Brovakiin> o.o
<RaveBrony> Eeewww
<Everlasting_Joy> You know what the worst part about a Halo movie will be? I'd watch it and say "why am I not playing the game?"
<MadSurge> Dtox: I did, just today! :$
*MahBoi777 hugs fillyfillyy back "long time no see ^_^"
<fillyfillyy> Yup.
<ekips> Everlasting_Joy you are not playing because you don't own an XBox?
<Dtox> my sister went all out this christmas and bought me a CRAP ton of pony stuff, first time since becomming a fan that I owned any merchandise
<Applesjack> Everlasting_Joy: Eeyuyp.
<Lasharus> Everlasting_Joy: I have a slightly different opinion. I'd think "jesus, they pumped MORE steroids into a corpse."
<RaveBrony> I got a bunch of pony cards for Christmas \o/ got me a golden foil Celestia
<Lasharus> I suppose twitches would be considered a live franchise, given that series.
<Rustyheadphones> Halo has a very interesting setting and the most boring protagonist ever!
<Everlasting_Joy> ekips: No, I have the games.
<Uboa-San> Halo 4?
<Dtox> been a fan for well over a year, never owned any merchandise till the last couple of days lol
*Bronysith puts Everlasting_Joy in a corset
<Bronysith> Uboa-San: yes
<MLP_Brovakiin> I haven't been on halo 4 in a while :I
<Dtox> isn't thiss infinity?
<Bronysith> RPGS> shooters
<Dtox> no wait
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Where's the nurse outfit ya fool?
<Dtox> this is halo wars
*Bronysith puts Everlasting_Joy ina nurse corset
<Lasharus> Note how nobody can recognise WHICH Halo game this is, even though the title was on screen 2 minutes ago.

<AssertiveFluttershy> Hey every pony whats goin on?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back derpy_h :)
<RaveBrony> Who the hell goes Looking for spoilers?
<Bronysith> halo wars shouldve been on pc, RTS on consoles just doesnt work
<Ninjazz> I'll wait for the inevitable leak they're going to do later today.
<Dtox> I sometimes can't help myself
<Rustyheadphones> I just love how every alien in the galaxy speaks english
<Bronysith> RTS is meant for the pc
<Rustyheadphones> agreed
<derpy_h> inb4 flood
<Dtox> ACTUALLY rusty, they're supposed to be speaking in their own language when going back and forth.
<Uboa-San> Who is Stream?
<Bronysith> even then, RTS isnt even that fun
<RaveBrony> All Halos should be on PC :3
<Bronysith> Uboa-San: who
<Scoot-Scootaloo> WHO WAS STREAM?
<Dtox> they aren't called "elites" or whatever either when you translate it.
<Lasharus> Yes, then I can have another platform I won't buy the daft games on, RaveBrony.
<Bronysith> "Im applejack, moar applefwittuh?"
<MLP_Brovakiin> Scoot-Scootaloo: No idea, some MLG guy :3
<Buytoast> oh man, Sir Dragonslammer's Terrordome of Sam Slamming Communism has an exclusive clip one day before it will be seen on television.
<Sumica> 00,10every guy always swares to pull out
<Buytoast> How exclusive
<RaveBrony> Lasharus: Hah :D
<Rustyheadphones> Bronysith, depends very much on the RTS game. Supreme Commander 1 is amazing, SupCom 2 is horrible
<fillyfillyy> Bye everypony, I'll be back on for the movie.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye fillyfillyy :)
<RaveBrony> Cya fillyfillyy!

<Scoot-Scootaloo> MaxBrony: You got a PROBLEM with that, nyuggah?

<AttackWithHugs> CCharmanderK: Excuse me, sir?
<Lasharus> How I miss ye.
<CCharmanderK> I meant to say "whaddid"
<AttackWithHugs> No, the last part.
<CCharmanderK> AttackWithHugs: I was quoting Tom Dubois/Colonel Stinkmeaner.
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs! <3
<MaxBrony> Oh shit, duty calls! Seeya evry1
<AttackWithHugs> CCharmanderK: I know. Just messin with ya. But seriously be careful

<AttackWithHugs> It's request time
<Scoot-Scootaloo> This is my request :3
<Uboa-San> Whats that video?
<CCharmanderK> Ah
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: http://i.imgur.com/4NNXq.jpg look what Perrydotto sent me :$
<Kandarihu> Yeah, it's kinda PC
<CCharmanderK> A Pinkie Pie ornament!!
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: GGHDLFDOFJO! Pinkieeeeeee <3
<AttackWithHugs> She's so adorrable with her snowflake. She looks like she's thinking about eating it :D
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: http://i.imgur.com/jDhqV.jpg also also also
<CCharmanderK> So much pony!!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Madsurge: Perry sent you all that? Lucky...
<AttackWithHugs> All my envy, MadSurge. Just have all of it
<CCharmanderK> I'm actually glad that I didn't get pony this Christmas. Last time my family tried to give me pony, it was all G3 stuff... :/
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: she also trolled me with another pink pony http://i.imgur.com/Re5Jt.jpg
<CCharmanderK> I actually have a G3 Pinkie Pie toy gathering dust in my closet.
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: That's not Pinkie! :O That's Pinklestia!
<MadSurge> Scoot-Scootaloo: also two posters of her stuff :)
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge gets all the pony.
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: "Gotcha!" :D
<CCharmanderK> The only G4 toy I have is Rainbow Dash. Which I had to buy myself.
<Kandarihu> Uh, let's not get stoned.
<AttackWithHugs> I had a Wave 5 BB Crystal Pinkie. I can't find her but I know she's in my room somewhere.
<jcelios> Kandarihu: party pooper!
<CCharmanderK> Same with my Rainbow Dash. Bad thing about that is that she's a brushable, so her mane is probably a total mess now.
<CCharmanderK> Hours of brusie, here I come!
<CCharmanderK> *brushie
<Kandarihu> jcelios, drugs are bad, mkay?
<jcelios> 'kay :<
<CCharmanderK> WOW, that guy must be stoned off his ass.
<CCharmanderK> And her.
<MadSurge> CCharmanderK: I agree
<jcelios> lol
<CCharmanderK> That guy's beard reminds me that I need to shave soon.
<Kandarihu> CCharmanderK, me too
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: http://i.imgur.com/g447A.jpg this was inside the Pinklestia box :D
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: Pfffft lol.
<CCharmanderK> OH DAMMIT
<CCharmanderK> I thought it was over!
<CCharmanderK> >_<
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: it's also the :gotcha: emoticon in Ponygoons :D
<kimplix> hi
<CCharmanderK> Please tell me we don't have to listen to this stoner for much longer.
*AttackWithHugs hands MadSurge all of her envy and jelly.
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: http://i.imgur.com/Fax9o.jpg and this is the outside of the box, so she clearly was trolling :D
<CCharmanderK> OH GOD, NOT ANOTHER STONER.
<CCharmanderK> Oh.
<CCharmanderK> Wait.
<CCharmanderK> ...I think I'm okay with this one.
<EspyLacopa> Pink Pony!
<CCharmanderK> NAKED!!
<CCharmanderK> SO MUCH NAKED
*AttackWithHugs giggles at the box
<MadSurge> D: NEKKID PEOPLE /).(\
<CCharmanderK> What the hell, Scoot-Scootaloo? What the actual hell?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> It's woodstock, I ain't gtta explain shit!
<kimplix> dafuq is this song?!
<CCharmanderK> This song is called "Mrmrhrmrhrmrhrmrhrmrh"
<Kandarihu> 1969 was the year we landed a man on the moon. It's also the year we reduced ourselves to animals
<CCharmanderK> ^
<CCharmanderK> All of my ^
<kimplix> all of ur ^
<CCharmanderK> Sounds like he's saying "faggot storm"
<kimplix> looks like a music video prmoting to nudity swimming
<kimplix> no offence
<CCharmanderK> FOR LORD'S SAKE, SCOOT-SCOOTALOO
<Scoot-Scootaloo> What?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> It's Woodstock.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I ain't gotta explain shit :$
<CCharmanderK> THAT'S THE PROBLEM
<EspyLacopa> Is Scootaloo related to Chicken Boo?
<kidzrul732> I just read the fanfic pattycakes. I must find a way to unsee
<Unnr> My mother had a ticket to woodstock, she gave it to someone else as she decided to do a baby-sitting thing instead
<CCharmanderK> :$
<CCharmanderK> Huh.
<kimplix> she's related to a shark :3
<CCharmanderK> So THAT'S how you make that emoticon.
<EspyLacopa> Hm?
<CCharmanderK> Wow, I just found my One Piece manga book without even trying.
<kimplix> ಠ.ಠ
<CCharmanderK> It was in one of the cubbies at my desk.
<CCharmanderK> It's really dusty. :I
<Rex_Mundi> look what i found. somebody made a custom MLP cover for his/her kindle. http://blog-imgs-51-origin.fc2.com/p/p/g/ppgcom/A_G8BuoCcAAH6wVs.jpg
<Kandarihu> Um, I have an apology that I think I need to take back, since 7 minutes ago.

<kimplix> i haven't seen a abirdge in a long time
<pyrocatboy> I've got special eyes!
<EspyLacopa> You say that as though bridges were rare, kimplix.
<Lasharus> I think I'll stick with DBZ abridged. It's a bit... less completely random.
<kimplix> i wish i did
<Kandarihu> The other night, I voted for Assassin's Creed II over Just Cause 2 in the Community Choice sale. When AC2 won, I apologized for that. But as of the top of this hour, JC2 is -75% and will be for the next 48 hours.
<Kandarihu> So... would that have happened if JC2 won and went -75% for 12 hours?
<kimplix> but bridges at my view arn't rare till they're wrecked
<CCharmanderK> MEESUTA PEETARU IS MY FAVORITE DRINK
<EspyLacopa> But were they wrecked by Ralph?
<kimplix> maybe
<kimplix> <_<
<kimplix> >_>
<CCharmanderK> OH YEAH, THIS!

<wipergone2> wtf
<Kammerjunk> How did I know this was RubberFruit even before looking down in the corner?
<pyrocatboy> oops sorry guys
<Scoot-Scootaloo> pyrocatboy: You should really put that on the approriate room :S
<Ponies47> The only shows I really liked on Cartoon Network was Ed Edd n' Eddy and Courage The Cowardly Dog
<MadSurge> PONIES
<Ponies47> Oh and Kids Next Door and a few others
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Also, no war stuff. Last time I did streamed something like that, I got in trouble :/
<Tovler> YES! Rifftrax of The Avengers, now to listen for another Brony reference.

<Kandarihu> This is one of the new shorts made for Youtube, right?
<Lightning_Wing> dang ads
<Kammerjunk> Ponies47: To be honest, I can't really think of a show I really watched asides from Kids Next Door. But that's not to say I didn't watch anything. Sometimes, I'd take a good long look at my bookcovers.
<Lil_B> and the original did more focus on atmsphere while this one does more focus on the melody
<thelonecubone> MLP_Brovakiin: great, and you?:)
<PonyIshBest> Kammerjunk your childhood wasn't very exciting was it
<MLP_Brovakiin> thelonecubone: Yeah I am good thanks :)
<Kammerjunk> PonyIshBest: My childhood was books.
<PonyIshBest> what kind of books?
<pony_1246> MUHAHAHA
<Ponies47> Kammerjunk, Cartoons were da shit for me when I was younger. I would sit infront of the TV for hours on end watching that stuff

<zangorwarrior> coinflip2: Just because.
<LadyCanary> CNreal: We cant show ponies 24/7. Dont like it? Go to youtube.
<Dauven> coinflip2: 'Cause it's a great video, probably.
<LadyCanary> People have other interests you know.
<Kammerjunk> coinflip2: Catchy tune, incoherent lyrics, silly video.

<LadyCanary> Dauven: Of course!!! Just keep it safe for work, dude.
<Derpy> this is gone mad.
<Kandarihu> CNreal, no. look at the timer above the video. If you refreshed the page within the past 6 days, you'll see how long it is until Movie Night
<Dauven> LadyCanary: I can't think of many NSFW cartoons anyways! :B
<Lil_B> I just plah Vidrrrr GAAAms
<zangorwarrior> Dauven: Awesome!
<LadyCanary> Dauven: Just dont piss off the mods, dont complain about what's on stream, and you'll be fine.
<Dauven> Has everyone here taken a look at Gravity Falls yet?
<VenHur> Oh god, that nickname reminds me of something...I HATE that block.
<zangorwarrior> Dauven: After all, I DID grew up with cartoons after all.
<LadyCanary> Dauven: YES. OMG YES
<Derpy> enough holding people up in air like a trophy.
<Dauven> Dude yeeeeeeeah.
<Afflict> http://www.tickld.com/images/content/35827.jpg
<LadyCanary> One of the best things Disney has done in a while.
<Dauven> I can't believe that Disney did that show!
<VenHur> It ruined Cartoon Network's ego as being a channel dedicated for CARTOONS!
<pony_2555> mahboi.
<Tovler> These barbie cartoons are reaso- I mean Japanese wrestling seem more hardcore.
<Derpy> so how long will this end.
<Buytoast> What is this?
<Dauven> When a friend told me it was on Disney channel, oh gosh.
<CNreal> 4 hours until movie night... Isn't it different from past schedules?
<Dauven> First episode I saw was The Inconveniencing.
<Stormy> o.O
<LadyCanary> Dauven: Indeed. Plus they got Paul Robertson (who did the pixel work for the Scott Pilgrim game) to do an episode.
<Kammerjunk> I never liked watching wrestling, to be honest. Then again, I never liked watching anything else on TV.
<Dauven> Who's seen that one?
<zangorwarrior> Dauven: I try to watch an episode of GF but I'm in the UK so, we haven't got the show yet so my alternative source was Youtube.
<Amu-chan> Hi Stormy. XD
<alexxm> VenHur notice how most of the guys moves seem to be head drops of some kind
<VenHur> I love Gravity Falls, it's an step to the right direction now that Disney is slowly comming into thier senses.
<Dauven> Oh, the Final Fighters episode?
<Lil_B> how long does this Video Last?!
<LadyCanary> Yessss.
<Stormy> hi
<Stormy> :P
<LadyCanary> Fight Fighters.
<coinflip2> Kammerjunk: ya I don't like watching tv either.
<Derpy> ...
<Dauven> zangorwarrior: I'm not sure if you get the same website over there I watch Gravity Falls on.
<Derpy> toast?
<Tovler> Disney still hasn't recovered from Michael Eisner.

<p3gu1n> who took the rum?!?!
<Kammerjunk> coinflip2 - Dauven: Oh! I just noticed! On the front page, out to the right there's a link saying "Subscribe to our newsletter!" right above the thumbnail of the newsletter itself.
<PonyIshBest> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9pzChni6H4
<Java> LadyCanary: I know, I just put this here so it can be shown later.
<Punkie_Pue> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ9ayQISNok
<CNreal> So I've asked this once before--hasn't the Friday Movie Night always started somewhere around this time (or an hour or so ago)? Or has it always started in the time that it has now?

<pony_80> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hckOo6Exwbo
<p3gu1n> no spam:'(
<p3gu1n> ok
<Java> Scoot-Scootaloo: But we can't do that during live streaming :(
<Amu-chan> There are a lot of people who for whatever reason don't get the difference, though. >->
<PonyIshBest> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-TNiUFtiG4
<Dauven> LadyCanary: What exactly do you mean?
<LadyCanary> I mean, there's a LOT of symbolism and such in the movie, Tovler.
<Neotyguy40> = != ==
<Neotyguy40> Just pointing that out
<pony_80> when will these links be streamed?
<pyrocatboy> Cello and Orchestra remix of The Final C ountdown by Europe http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IliwQImJrYE&list=PL1B0FCEF532E3DC85
<Tovler> LadyCanary: Anyone who's had a deadline could at least relate to Black Swan. Plus hasn't everyone seen the original Swan Lake?
<Buytoast> Whenever he feels like streaming them
<LadyCanary> Guys. Stop spamming youtube links. The only place the videos you want will go is in the request room, which is CLOSED.
<J_E_Smith71> pony_80: Not now the request stream is over, we're just sharing links with each other now
<pony_80> kks
<Dauven> I don't think I've seen the original Swan lake.
<zangorwarrior> Dauven: The closest you'll get to swan lake is Billy Elliot. xD
<Stormy> why would we be using '=='
<pony_80> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjGSMUep6_4
<Punkie_Pue> Shes's a pony! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQQpOUX_lh4
<LadyCanary> Tovler: But still, it's filed with symbolism and mis en scenes.
<LadyCanary> filled*
<Buytoast> all i know is that i dislike pretty much all the links they shoot down this alley
<pyrocatboy> LadyCanary I'm just posting some mid-stream music.
<Neotyguy40> Because "You're" is already defined
<Dauven> zangorwarrior: Totally lost. :B
<Buytoast> and that's how i keep track of what i've seen already
<zangorwarrior> Dauven: xD
<PonyIshBest> I am princess Celestia http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-TNiUFtiG4
<Neotyguy40> It's constant
<Dauven> Oh man! I got two really cool videogames for Christmas!

<Buytoast> i bought veiwtiful joe 2 and a PS2 an hour ago
<thelonecubone|MW2> bye Arcium
<LadyCanary> Tovler: But holy crap it was so gooooood.
<Dauven> Buytoast: I've actually never played the second one!
<J_E_Smith71> Dauven: Epic Mickey 2 and Rathcet & Klank: Full Frontal Assualt
<Neotyguy40> I'm just explaining how stupid the argument was
<coinflip2> Dauven: I got call of duty black ops: declassified for my PSVita
<Neotyguy40> By creating an even stupider argument
<Tovler> LadyCanary: Southland Tales?
<Dauven> J_E_Smith71: Is that like, a new one for PS3?
<J_E_Smith71> ...that mispelling
<Dauven> coinflip2: I can't imagine that a CoD on Vita would be that great.. How does it stack up?
<LadyCanary> Tovler: Black Swan.
<pyrocatboy> coinflip2 Do you want my playlists? They have many genres in them.
<LadyCanary> ^^"
<Stormy> blah
<Kammerjunk> Dauven: No, but I got a bunch of money to waste on the Steam Christmas sale.
<Stormy> I'm just in a bad mood today, sorry
<Neotyguy40> lol
<thelonecubone|MW2> Dauven: i didnt got any games, but i did got a gift card to Gamestop
<Java> Still saving money for Ni No Kuni :/
<pony_80> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtrI3r9ijnE
<Dauven> coinflip2: I like, stopped playing CoD a while ago. Tried it a few days ago and just like, it's way too stressful for me now!
<J_E_Smith71> Dauven: Yep its new and also on Vita. It's $20 for both versions at once
<derpy_h> well ill be back
<J_E_Smith71> Wrek time
<wipergone2> hi Wrek
<thelonecubone|MW2> A Wrek stream :O
<Java> Streaming's up
<Dauven> Kammerjunk: I'm broke, otherwise I'd go buy a buncha' indie games. :P
<Stormy> I was just trying to make a joke and it turned into an argument :(
<kidzrul732> I like cheese
<Kandarihu> Oh Hai, Wrek
*Stormy cries
<pony_80> is the turnaround storm music?
<LadyCanary> WREKY!!!!
<pony_80> that*
<Java> Dauven: Go get humble bundle?
<thelonecubone|MW2> Dauven: have fun with your games :)
<Dauven> Fallout.
<Neotyguy40> Why a bad mood?
<Dauven> thelonecubone|MW2: Thanks dude!
<Kammerjunk> Dauven: So far, I've managed to not use anything. Wouldn't want them gone before I New Year's Eve.
*LadyCanary gives Wrek a kiss <3
<Tovler> LadyCanary: My jimmies almost rustled. But yeah, Black Swan might be in my top 10.
<pony_80> well that was quick
<thelonecubone|MW2> :O
<pony_80> o
<Dauven> Of course it was Fallout.
<thelonecubone|MW2> fallout :O
<p3gu1n> ah the fuck
<Proud> Oooh
<Stormy> I kind of just go crazy when I have to stay at my parents' house for more than a couple days at a time
<LeGoMeEGGO> ahhh fallout... so many memories
<Amu-chan> I wasn't actually arguing, I was taking Stormy's statement "basically the same thing" and used it as a takeoff to define both as a joke.
<Stormy> I'm not sure why
<coinflip2> Dauven: Ya I actually don't really like fps's that much, but i bought it just for fun. I haven't even touched campaign yet, I've just been playing multiplayer. It's really good for a handheld.
<Proud> Fallout
<Java> I wish someone live streaming Dark or Demon's Souls......
<Dauven> Who's streaming this?
<pony_80> whos playing?
<LadyCanary> Dauven: This here is Wrek.
<Buytoast> isn't turnabout storm that bad cross over thing where they ruin phoenix wright with horses?
<Punkie_Pue> wrek
<brendan10211> hello!
<p3gu1n> whose... whos the fuck is playing this amazing game
<thelonecubone|MW2> Dauven: look at the bottom right :)
<Dauven> LadyCanary: Thanks for the quick answer, pal. c:
<Punkie_Pue> You can see his watermark
<DerpyMuffins> Wrek: stream
<Kammerjunk> Dauven: This is Wrek. Wrek draws amazing pictures and plays games.
<LadyCanary> Dauven: DEFINITELY dont piss him off.
<Dauven> Haha, I can't piss anybody off.
<Punkie_Pue> What happens if you piss wrek off LadyCanary?
<Kandarihu> Wrek, if I still have $3.89 at the end of this Steam Holiday Sale, I'm gifting you Beat Hazard.
<p3gu1n> well cum
<pyrocatboy> And now I hand the reighns over to Wrek.
<Stormy> And also, shopping with my mom is not a fun experience
<Buytoast> you're pissing me off right now son
<LadyCanary> Punkie_Pue: You dont want to know.
<Java> Wellcome to your dome.
<Dauven> Punkie_Pue: You piss off Wrek? Wrek pisses ON you.
<Punkie_Pue> lol
<Rommulus> He is an awesome person, while streaming he will also play awesome music sometimes
<Dauven> Punkie_Pue: Or so I'd guess. This is my first time visiting. :B
<Punkie_Pue> I dont piss anyone off, i dont think
<LadyCanary> Dauven: Not even close.
<coinflip2> pyrocatboy: sorry for the late response, but ya, could you send me a playlist or two? :)
<LadyCanary> Wreky voice <333
<Derpy> ...
<LeGoMeEGGO> sounds good bro
<Dauven> LadyCanary: Wrek throws you a small party with just your family and a few close friends?
<thelonecubone|MW2> Dauven: First time? welcome to Bronystate, Make surre you read the rules:)
<Derpy> what is this?
<CriticKitten> Pissing off LadyCanary is like pissing off the Lady of Pain: you just don't do it.
<Ouroboros> Check the +20db boost is enabled in the microphone settings?
<Punkie_Pue> wELCOME Dauven
<Kammerjunk> Dauven: Well, to put it like this, I told people he was playing Deus Ex: Invisible War and felt the retribution.
<thelonecubone|MW2> sure*
<Kammerjunk> To be fair, I had that coming.
<Shizuka> 13CriticKitten: correction, you do it *once*
<RainbowDashSavior> start>type "sound",>recording>Right clik ur mic>levels>100%
<Buytoast> boy, i haven't heard Wrek talk this often before
<Dauven> Kammerjunk: What did the-
<Buytoast> this a special occasion?
<Dauven> OH GOSH THIS IS MY FAVORITE EXPANSION!
<CriticKitten> Shizu: And then never again.
<p3gu1n> fallout is not for the weak hearted. those who can't take it plz leave
<Derpy> what is this???
<LadyCanary> Fallout
<CriticKitten> Because u ded.
<Derpy> can someone tell me?
<Dauven> This is easily my favorite expansion.
<Derpy> fallout??
<Punkie_Pue> Derpy fallout
<J_E_Smith71> Well we get an early taste of the opening to WALL*E
<Kammerjunk> Dauven: It really is a great DLC.
<RainbowDashSavior> does he h ave the poni mod
<Derpy> ...
<coinflip2> how many fallout games are there?
<LadyCanary> 3
<Dauven> I think it's the one that ties all of the other expansions together the best.
<wipergone2> i think 4
<CNreal> @prince-dari: I'm sorry to be a bother right now. I'm just really confused.
<J_E_Smith71> ...no wait that joke doesn't work since there were no humans there
<RainbowDashSavior> do you have any poni mods installed?
<thelonecubone|MW2> There is 5 games
<pyrocatboy> coinflip2 I give you the link in a PM
<LadyCanary> Fallout=/=ponies. Not everything can have ponies in it.
<coinflip2> pyrocatboy: okay, go ahead.
<Kammerjunk> RainbowDashSavior: If you want pony mods, you should wait for the FO:E mod to be finished. They're remaking just about anything that fits.
<LadyCanary> it just doesnt work that way.
<thelonecubone|MW2> there is fallout fallout 2 fallout brotherhood of steel fallout 3 fallout NV
<Ryunosuke> LadyCanary: I beg to differ
<Buytoast> not everything needs goddamn horses in it
<Ryunosuke> see: Fallout: Equestria
<Amu-chan> Maybe I should be less subtle with my jokes...
<Ryunosuke> :)
<Buytoast> for crying out loud people
<Tovler> Silent Hill can have pon… actually, i dunno
<Dauven> LadyCanary: You could just wear semi-transparent contact lenses.
<RainbowDashSavior> k thx
<thelonecubone|MW2> and i think there is one that is called fallout Tactics
<LadyCanary> Dauven: Huh?
<Dauven> LadyCanary: You said not everything can have ponies!
<Kammerjunk> That's Dead Money in a nutshell, really.
<p3gu1n> ive seen the dlc before. its awesome
<Stormy> Nah it's fine
<Dauven> If you get some lenses with like, an opaque picture of a pony printed on 'em.
<Dauven> You wouldn't be able to escape seeing 'em. Ever.
<Dauven> Unless you stabbed yer' own eyes out!
<Dauven> Or.. Like... Took 'em off..
<Ryunosuke> just be glad its not G3 ponies :)
<Derpy> i cant watch it its to scary :S
<Kammerjunk> Dauven: That reminds me, I haven't been using my lenses in a while.
<J_E_Smith71> Now he's dons his gay appearal...
<Kammerjunk> Also, I need more. Dammit.
<Buytoast> why the hell would you want giant colored horses obscuring your vision
<CNreal> Argh, time zones aggravate me sometimes...
<LadyCanary> I'd actually love contacts with a little star etched on the side.
<Kammerjunk> Buytoast: One of the great philosophical questions.
<coinflip2> since this is a bethesda game, I can't wait till Elder Scrolls Online!!
<LadyCanary> So I can cosplay SeeU ^_^
<Dauven> Kammerjunk: I can't trust myself to use contact lenses. I went to sleep with 'em in far too often when I had 'em.
<J_E_Smith71> ...wonder if it's too late to still make Christmass riffs. Probably not since we have a Christmas film tonight
<RainbowDashSavior> wrek, ~ then noclip
<Kammerjunk> Dauven: Yeah, I slept a few times with the lenses still in. Itches like mad the next day.
<RainbowDashSavior> or ufo
<LadyCanary> Wrek Wrek :3
<Amu-chan> I just feel bad that you're in a bad mood and I don't think I really helped it. >-<
<pyrocatboy> coinflip2 Did you get it?
<Tovler> The last christmas movie we had on BMN was Babes in Toyland. I can't wait.
<LadyCanary> Heeheeheehee ^////^
<Dauven> LadyCanary: Looks like somebody's got a little crush! :B
<p3gu1n> oh yeah there are some zones where you can't breathe if im not correct, if not correct me
<LadyCanary> Dauven: Well actually....
<wipergone2> Tovler: dont speak about tht movie
<Dauven> You two are dating, aren't you?
<LadyCanary> Yup
<Dauven> Haha! I figured that was what was going on! :B
<Dauven> Do you guys live near each other IRL or is it a distance thing?
<Stormy> It's really okay
<thelonecubone|MW2> Dauven: Oh yeah, your new. LadyCanary X Wrek is one of the OTP in Bstate
<RainbowDashSavior> yea
<Dauven> Volume is much nicer, thanks Wrek.
<LadyCanary> Yes yes sweetie.
<J_E_Smith71> Yep
<Rommulus> nice and clear
<Kammerjunk> Loud and clear.
<Stormy> don't worry about it
<mister-miester> eeyup
<LadyCanary> Long distance Dauven.
<Dauven> I wish you guys luck!
<p3gu1n> Dauven: if you know what she means
<pyrocatboy> Do I hear a dentist's drill?
<Dauven> I had a long distance romantic thing going with this guy from Louisiana.
<Derpy> is the fallout video over? :S
<Dauven> It didn't work out because we simply didn't both have the time to maintain like, skyping with each other and spending time together.
<Alchemist> OCD the game
<wipergone2> lost the game
<twilight_sprinkle> no Derpy, its live-play, but i doubt it'll be very scary though
<p3gu1n> how the heck does a long distance relationship work
<LadyCanary> Wait a second Dauven...you're a lady?
<Dauven> Alchemist: OCD the game is called "Katamari."
<thelonecubone|MW2> Ohai Sprunkls ^w^
<Kammerjunk> p3gu1n: Beats me.
<twilight_sprinkle> hai tehlonpot :3
<Dauven> LadyCanary: Oh no, I'm a guy! I'm just gay. c:
<Alchemist> Dauven: heard about it, seen it, never played it.
<LadyCanary> Ahhhh I see Dauven :3
<Kammerjunk> Katamari Damacy¨
<Derpy> how long will the fallout video end? :S
<p3gu1n> Kammerjunk: i don't see how one can keep a relation ship that way
<Dauven> Katamari Damacy is wonderful!
<Dauven> Derpy: The end of the fallout video will last approximately 1 second.
<thelonecubone|MW2> Derpy: this game isnt Scary man
<Dauven> Derpy: I don't know hwo long the rest is gonna' be, though.
<J_E_Smith71> Derpy: Wrek said he'll probably play until BMN
<Kammerjunk> p3gu1n: Me neither, but what do I know, I've never tried it.
<Derpy> will it looks scary for me :S
<p3gu1n> Dauven: gay huh. are you the big spoon or the little spoon
<cowvarkian> >_ >
<cowvarkian> <_ <
<LadyCanary> p3gu1n: Really?
<p3gu1n> ha
<Kammerjunk> Uranium fever has gone and got me down.
<p3gu1n> no
<p3gu1n> its just a joke mama
<p3gu1n> mam
<Kammerjunk> Wait, did Wrek just say please?
<DerpyMuffins> That is really personal p3gu1n
<Dauven> p3gu1n: I'm the shit covered spoon.
<Dauven> One good line deserves a response in kind, right? :B
<p3gu1n> did wrek just talk to me? well i believe i just done goofed up
<CriticKitten> p3gu1n: It can work provided both parties are trustworthy.
<Dauven> Hahahaha.
*LadyCanary giggles.
<Dauven> With my guy, I was the big spoon, 'cause he was like, really short.
<LadyCanary> Heh
<Dauven> It honestly worked out fine. We broke up, but we're still friends an' all. c:
<p3gu1n> lol
<p3gu1n> the shit spoon?
<Dauven> I broke things off because I was starting to depend upon him way too much.
<Tovler> I guess I won't be able to pick Pitch Perfect for A movie until 2014.
<CriticKitten> Whoops, should've also been to Kammer. But yeah, it works fine, if both individuals are willing to commit to it.
<Dauven> Oh yeah, the ambient in Fallout NV is spectacular.
<p3gu1n> where does one get a shit spoon?
<RainbowDashSavior> o hai ther
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Ah, I see.
<Alchemist> what expansion is this?
<cowvarkian> hey rainbow jesus
<Dauven> -Laughs out loud at Wrek-
<LadyCanary> Nice Wreky xD
<thelonecubone|MW2> Alchemist: dead money
<Alchemist> look, its britney spears!
<thelonecubone|MW2> Lel
<Dauven> Alchemist: This is my favorite expansion!
<p3gu1n> cowvarkian: oh hey, whats up
<RainbowDashSavior> its Gaben
<cowvarkian> ohai
<Tovler> One of these days, I'll play an actual FPS
<Dauven> Alchemist: Have you played Old World Blues?
<RainbowDashSavior> o hai
<QBAlchemist> Alchemist: "just leave her alone!" XD
<cowvarkian> p3gu1n: are you the penguin I'm thinking of?
<CriticKitten> Kammerjunk: Unfortunately not everyone can handle that sort of thing, as I learned from my own experience. :p
<Alchemist> Dauven: nope, just the vanilla game
<p3gu1n> cowvarkian: yep
<cowvarkian> cool
<CriticKitten> That is a LOT of flavor text.
<J_E_Smith71> She's not doingf any of those motions the text lies
<Java> Reminds me of Sawyer from Black Lagoon.
<RainbowDashSavior> get back shes a suiside bomber
<p3gu1n> cowvarkian: imgay in the flesh
<coinflip2> Dauven: This may sound wierd, but i just have to tell you. I have sooo much respect for gay people, whether male or female. To come out about your sexuality is not easy. You are more of a man than I ever will be. Brohoof. /)
<cowvarkian> p3gu1n: tis what I thoguht
<cowvarkian> *thought
<JAG_01> And GOLF AD. I hate borrowing computers.
<Dauven> coinflip2: Haha, dude, brohoof! :B
<amatobrony> stubburn aint she?
<p3gu1n> yeah only i can be so akward
<Dauven> I used to be really nervous about coming out because I was picked on for being gay when I was little, like..
<RainbowDashSavior> why doesn't she speak?
<Dauven> I was picked on for being 'gay' before I even knew what being gay was.
<CriticKitten> How old is this game? I'm a bit surprised it can animate basic movement features, but doesn't animate any of its flavor text.... O.o
<Dauven> So there was a big stigma associated with it.
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Fallout: New Vegas came out in October of '10.
<Afflict> My headphones got tangled up around my leg, and for some reason it felt like someone was grabbing my leg. Scared the shit out of me :P
<Dauven> I got outed in High School, actually, so I can't say it was my own courage that caused me to.
<Dauven> But once I realized that the only people who really cared about it were people I didn't care for in the first place..
<CriticKitten> Really? O.o What's with the lack of animation, then? Weird....
<Dauven> I realized that logically? It's silly to be upset about anybody's sexual attraction.
<Dauven> Given that like, most people you'll probably NEVER be in a situation where you can even experience facets of that attraction firsthand.
<Amu-chan> XD
<RainbowDashSavior> just ~ + noclip n flai
<coinflip2> Dauven: ya, people these days throw that word arround alot. And we live ina time and place were everyone deserves to be accepted, no matter their sexuality, color or race.
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Well, he's not saying anything. She's mute.
<Dauven> And to me, getting upset over anything beyond that is just.. Gettin' upset at someone's nature. Which I don't think folks should ever do.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Of Skies Long Forgotten (Update Complete!)
<Dauven> CriticKitten: Yeah, that's one of the really cool things about this expansion, all of her communication is done in "pantomime."
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: she's not*
<CriticKitten> Damn, if not for the "angry" part, I'd have joked at it being Saturn. Curses, foiled again. :(
<RainbowDashSavior> I dont believe that discords coming back.. i cant wait
<J_E_Smith71> She shaved her head, she must be Sinéad O'Connor
<pyrocatboy> Kammerjunk (First time seeing this) Or she had her voicebox cut out.
<Dauven> Y'know, since all of her voice-cords-box got slice-um-dice.
<Alchemist> best VA ever!
<Dauven> coinflip2: Hear hear, man!
<Kammerjunk> Dauven: That's more or less how I live. "Don't worry, be happy," I'd say, but I don't think that quite applies.
<CriticKitten> No, I know she's not able to speak. I get that. :p I'm just surprised that her actions aren't animated, but rather are shown via flavor text instead.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates December 28th
<Dauven> Kammerjunk: Naw, it applies!
<Dauven> If something's not directly affecting you, why fret over it?
<RainbowDashSavior> ehh
<Alchemist> CriticKitten: I guess it was waaaaaay more time preserving this way. (for the programmers/animators I mean)
<Kammerjunk> Dauven: Well, the thing is that I'm quoting Bobby McFerrin, but I do have concerns in life.
<Dauven> Acknowledge it, and whatever it might be, but don't tear your hair out over it. That's my viewpoint.
<twilight_sprinkle> Dauven: well you cant ignore things that happen around you just because it doesnt affect you
<Dauven> I don't ignore stuff that doesn't affect me.
<coinflip2> Dauven: well said, good sir. I don't know about you, but I still haven't told anyone I'm a brony. I want to, but I'm scared that I won't be accepted anymore by my friends or family. And there isn't any bronies near were I live, so I have no one to talk to, except you guys. And that means alot to mean when people have conversations with me on here. It completes me, and I just want to thank you, and every other brony, for acceptin
<Dauven> I acknowledge what it is that's happening, then move on.
<CriticKitten> Alchemist: Well yes, obviously it'd be way less intensive. But this *is* a AAA title so I guess I was a bit surprised they didn't put time into that, is all.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im home
<aniderp|bestcakeever> bus was ;later getting there and got home late :\
<J_E_Smith71> Mission failed
<wipergone2> ded
<Dauven> coinflip2: Aww, that's so sweet dude! c:
<RainbowDashSavior> DIE
<wipergone2> Fission Mailed
<CriticKitten> I told my family I'm a brony. I dun really give a shit what they think of me. ....uh, pretty sure you're not supposed to go splodey. o.o
<thelonecubone|MW2> Welcome back aniderp|bestcakeever :)
<CriticKitten> You're being attacked by ninja?
<pyrocatboy> Wrek whats wrong? Wrek? WREK!? WRRREEEEEEEEEEECCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKK!
<Alchemist> CriticKitten: yes, a triple A title with an already outdated 3d engine :D
<coinflip2> Dauven: I have a tear in my eye man, because of how beautiful this community is.
<Dauven> coinflip2: In my opinion, is someone who's not going to accept you just because you happen to like a certain cartoon a person that's worth having in your life?
<Dauven> I know it's more complicated with family though. Especially if you're depending on them for shelter.
<Dauven> Y'know, this is my first time ever exploring the community?
<RainbowDashSavior> you got to admit that it would be a hella of a surprise to someone that doesn't know about the show
<Alchemist> CriticKitten: You are right of course, though it didnt surprise/bother me.
<Tovler> I need to get active in the community. I'm losing my broniness.
<Dauven> I've always liked the show, but a week or two ago I dropped acid and watched a Ponies marathon?
<wipergone2> why Wrek
<Dauven> Show like, took on a whole new meaning for me.
<CriticKitten> My family doesn't get it. To them it's like my enjoyment of Doctor Who. They don't like that show either. I think I was secretly adopted. >_>
<Dauven> It's my hands down favorite show now. c:
<Dauven> CriticKitten: Whatever, they're just TV-shows!
<thelonecubone|MW2> Dauven: Cool :)
<JAG_01> I just don't make too big a deal of it.
<Dauven> CriticKitten: My dad likes MSNBC, and I don't, but I don't get on his case for it-
<cowvarkian> Dauven: I'm sure that doing acid while watching this show would have that affect
<CriticKitten> Dauven: Yar. I just like to joke about their lack of taste. :p
<Dauven> cowvarkian: It was absolutely amazing. unlike any other show or movie I've watched on the stuff.
<Kammerjunk> Dauven: Oh boy. If you don't know a lot about the fandom, you'll want to stay away from places like 4chan's /mlp/ board.
<coinflip2> Dauven: ya, if someone told me last year that my favorite show would be My Little Pony, I would have laughed. But now it is one of the biggest parts of my life, and it's the best thing that ever happened to me.
<RainbowDashSavior> Kammerjunk: agreed
<Dauven> CriticKitten: I know what you mean, I like to tease my dad that he's watching more of "AgreeTV"
<LeGoMeEGGO> coinflip2: same here
<coinflip2> LeGoMeEGGO: /)
<Kammerjunk> Dauven: But yeah, to summarise my view on life, tolerance except for intolerance. That is to say, I tolerate everything about people as long as it's not intolerant or otherwise hurtful towards myself or others.
<coinflip2> Kammerjunk: good outlook. bro
<Tovler> I had to watch other shows because I couldn't believe MLP was my favorite. :( I guess it actually wasn't.
<JAG_01> In my experience, there is a line between "I like this" and "OMGTHISISTHEBESTEVARYOUMUSTLIKEITOMGOMGOMG."
<aniderp|bestcakeever> can someone do me a favor?
<coinflip2> yep!
<Rommulus> whats that aniderp|bestcakeever
<Kammerjunk> aniderp|bestcakeever: Depends on the favour.
<Dauven> Kammerjunk: That's a really nice philosophy. And tolerence except for intolerance is nice and concise.
<[Alpha]> :I
<aniderp|bestcakeever> put me in a strait jakcet
<aniderp|bestcakeever> :\
<J_E_Smith71> Bless ya Wrek
<aniderp|bestcakeever> and throw me in spongey room
<TrixieMuffin> Gesundhoof
<JAG_01> So yeah. I'll admit to liking it if asked, but I know that talking your ear off about it is a good way to ensure that the other person WON'T like it, too.
<Rommulus> I would but I dont have one.
<Kammerjunk> aniderp|bestcakeever: But you're on BronyState. I thought strait jackets were mandatory.
<Dark_Horst> dat sneeze
<CNreal> That can be arranged
<Dauven> JAG_01: Best way I've found to get people to watch the show is to just be like.
<MadSurge> Gesundheit and gesundheit two Wrek :D
<Kammerjunk> JAG_01: I completely agree.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> you dont gtet it..
<Dauven> "Yeah, it's pretty good. It's made by the same woman who did Fosters and the Powerpuff Girls."
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im gonna flip really bad ...
<Dauven> aniderp|bestcakeever: What's wrong?
<thelonecubone|MW2> aniderp|bestcakeever: I'll be ther in a sec. but i'm in a strait jackets as well :/
<thelonecubone|MW2> there*
<Kammerjunk> JAG_01: I mean, I'll mention it and talk about it if they ask, but that's it.
<RainbowDashSavior> the only way to know if someones a brony, without directly asking them is to ask them if they recconise an mlp symbol (like a cutie mark), thats how i secretly ask people
<coinflip2> JAG_01: I would also tell someone I liked it if they asked, but I'm not gonna shove it down their throat and force them to watch it.
<JAG_01> Yep. All they need to know is "it's a good show, and a lot of people like it."
<Dauven> .. Why would you secretly ask people?
<RainbowDashSavior> to avoid an hour of explaining
<coinflip2> I've actually never told anyone I'm a brony.
<Dauven> Just come on out with it. Be like "Do you like Friendship is Magic?"
<Dauven> I'unno, I usually just open up by asking folks if they like cartoons.
<Dauven> That way it opens the door for me to talk about ponies without me just seeming like I'm jumping down the person's throat like-
<Dauven> "HEY NICE TO MEET YOU DO YOU LIKE PONIES?"
<Tovler> *watching Fallout 3 being streamed on the Wii U browser*
<Uakh> that awkward moment, when MLP gets brought up in a conversation for some reason with people you don't really know, and you have a split second to decide what to say not knowing whether they are bronies or haters.
<Zacklego> this is newvegas
<Zacklego> not 3
<Kammerjunk> RainbowDashSavior: That reminds me of a thread I saw recently on /mlp/ on how to recognise other bronies. Something about a phrase. One would say "Praise the Sun," to which the other would respond "Double the fun."
<Kammerjunk> I hope it doesn't catch on, that sounds silly.
<Dauven> Kammerjunk: Indeed.
<coinflip2> I guess it would be easier to ease into telling them through a conversation than just saying "I LIKE PONIES!!!!"
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i cant take it...
*aniderp|bestcakeever cries
<Dauven> coinflip2: Totally!
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Daring Explorer / Ponyclopaedia / Applebloom's Holidays
<JAG_01> I'd start by talking about other good shows, and then use my judgemennt on whether or not I should bring ponies into it.
<J_E_Smith71> Whoa crap that was close
<Tovler> I can't wait for my 27th last-whole-pizza-I'll-ever-eat this year.
<RainbowDashSavior> the cutie mark recognition method kinda works better though
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i cant take it anymore...
*aniderp|bestcakeever claws at the ground
<DerpyMuffins> This some scary shit Wrek
<coinflip2> And I really want to tell someone about it. There is a need within me to tell someone. But I can't bring myself to do it.
<LeGoMeEGGO> i just enjoy fandom with the great anonymous fanbase online
<Kammerjunk> Anonymity is a blessing often ignored.
<coinflip2> LeGoMeEGGO: same because everyone is so nice and accepting
<Uakh> I find it easier to give subtle signals, like dressing in a rainbow dash fursuit at work.
<Kammerjunk> Uakh: I laughed.
<LeGoMeEGGO> Uakh: haha
<Tovler> I don't think I'll tell anyone irl my love for Animal Crossing nor MLP
<coinflip2> Uakh: :D
<RainbowDashSavior> I told my best friend a few weeks ago, and it turns out that he was a brony all along lol
<Juice> 2 Hours, 57 minutes!
<coinflip2> Tovler: animal crossing is amazing. nuff said
*aniderp|bestcakeever chews the carpet
<LeGoMeEGGO> RainbowDashSavior: same for me, although he wasn't so excited about it
<pony_9317> :P
<thelonecubone|MW2> Tovler: I need to get animal crossing >w<
<Dauven> Okay, updating my music on my iphone now :3
*Juice chews aniderp|bestcakeever
<Tovler> Animal Crossing: the Movie for B
*aniderp|bestcakeever growls
<Kammerjunk> Wait, there's an Animal Crossing film?
<coinflip2> does anyone like the brony musician Silva Hound?
<Kammerjunk> Dat reflex shot.
<Mr> i havent playe dfallot in ages
<RainbowDashSavior> coinflip2: Eeeup
<LadyCanary> Kammerjunk: Yup.
<Rommulus> Dat moment when not sure if dead or alive.
*Juice puts tape on aniderp|bestcakeever's mouth

<Juice> HEY male_writer
<Rommulus> Hey male_writer how are you?

<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai male_writer :)

<Rommulus> I am good :D
<LeGoMeEGGO> doin good
<Juice> male_writer: I'm fine
<coinflip2> and i'm fine thanks
<JAG_01> Best way to play an FPS: Play paranoid. Moves? SHOOT IT. Makes noise? SHOOT IT. Does nothing? ...SHOOT IT.
<Kammerjunk> male_writer: Salve! I'm alright, thanks, albeit a bit tired.
<male_writer> Hey MLP_Brovakiin DerpyMuffins, and coinflip2
<CCharmanderK> Hey guys.
<[Alpha]> Shoot all the thing!!!!
<Juice> I HUG KITTIES!!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai CCharmanderK :)
<coinflip2> :) Hey CCharmanderK
<thelonecubone|MW2> Hi CCharmanderK
<Kammerjunk> JAG_01: If you still have ammo left at the end of the day, you're doing it wrong.
<Tovler> lets see if I can listen to the Animal Crossing Wild World theme without crying...
<RainbowDashSavior> @coinflip2: this is my favourite song of his: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTw6a0MMEc
<Rommulus> Harro CCharmanderK
<male_writer> Hey DerpyMuffins, I wanted to thank you for introducing me or telling me about FimFiction. I love it!
<thelonecubone|MW2> male_writer: Just playing som cod at the time
<LadyCanary> Ah Wreky x3
<thelonecubone|MW2> :P
<CCharmanderK> I just realized that I should be working on designing my website, but I'm too much of a lazy fucker to do so right now.
*Juice shits on the carpet
<thelonecubone|MW2> RainbowDashSavior: No videos during stream
<RainbowDashSavior> kk
<[Alpha]> Happens to the best of us
<LadyCanary> Is it for a class, CCharmanderK?
<JAG_01> No, if you still have ammo left, the next room is a boss.
<Rommulus> Then come in take a seat and watch some Fallout CCharmanderK
<LadyCanary> And Juice behave.
<Kammerjunk> CCharmanderK: I should be working on completing a 3d object, but on the other hand, BronyState.
<Juice> Guys, don't sit on the carpet
<CCharmanderK> LadyCanary: No, I'm just doing it so that I can have my own place on the net.
<pyrocatboy> What am I doing in this game?
<coinflip2> RainbowDashSaviour: ya that songs amazing!
<DerpyMuffins> male_writer No problem
<CCharmanderK> You know, a homepage.
<LadyCanary> Ah.
<Juice> LadyCanary: NO, YOU BEHAVE!
<LadyCanary> Sounds nice.
<LadyCanary> Aw, cute.
<AdamTheDuck> Good morning BronyState. :)
<Kammerjunk> Jump him, contrain his arms.
<Kammerjunk> That's what you get for sitting so close.
<pyrocatboy> Yep, thats me.
<thelonecubone|MW2> Hi AdamTheDuck :P
<CCharmanderK> A rrrrrrrapt audience.
<LeGoMeEGGO> its afternoon where i am AdamTheDuck
<Dauven> Oh man.
<male_writer> So far my favorite fanfics on there are the Spike fanfics, and how in some he expresses his feelings about beling left out most of the time by Twilight and the rest of the Mane 6
<Dauven> I had another window up for a second?
*thelonecubone|MW2 lick AdamTheDuck_ :P
<Dauven> LadyCanary: I had the other window up for a second and I like, heard Dean Domino's voice on Fallout-
<LadyCanary> ?
<Dauven> And for a split second I thought it was Wrek's voice?
<LadyCanary> Ha.
<Dauven> And my first thought was like "Damn LadyCanary 's a lucky lady."
<[Alpha]> Toast
<CrystalPhoenix> http://derpy.me/3OSlq best show
<LadyCanary> Whoops.
<Ouroboros> I havent read any fanfiction yet. Someone recommended Friendship is Optimal. Is it any good?
<Dauven> Oh, Dean Domino's voice. <3
<LadyCanary> Dauven: Oh I feel lucky ^^"
<DerpyMuffins> male_writer: Go read Background Pony
<DerpyMuffins> Like now
<Kammerjunk> CrystalPhoenix: I call blasphemy. Steven Magnet is best pony.
<male_writer> Oh, okay. And Background Pony is on fimfiction, right DerpyMuffins?
<coinflip2> male_writer: have you ever read the fanfic "The Best Night Ever" and it's sequel "This Platinum Crown"? best fanfics I've ever read.
<DerpyMuffins> Yea
<CrystalPhoenix> male_writer, yeah
*Juice poops on DerpyMuffins
<Ouroboros> Chem resistant?
<Kammerjunk> Ouroboros: Depends on what kind of stories you like.
<DerpyMuffins> Pooped on by Juice?
<Dauven> Whoa whoa whoa
<male_writer> I think I have Coinflip2 and thank you CrystalPhoenix.
<Dauven> WHOA WHOA WHOA WREK
<cowvarkian> WHOA WHOA WHOA DAUVEN
<Ouroboros> Hmm ok, thanks Kammerjunk. Guess I'll just give it a try.
<male_writer> And those fanfics of Spike makes me wish there would be an episode where he expressed to them how he feels about being left out.
<LadyCanary> Juice: Stop that.
<cowvarkian> I don't even know what we're talking about
<Dauven> Hmm.
<LadyCanary> It's fucking gross.
<male_writer> expresses*
<CrystalPhoenix> that feel when you see your favorite fiction getting recommended and you're not the one recommending it
<Kammerjunk> Ouroboros: The thing is, it's in an alternate universe and with humans. That being said, it's still very very good.
<Juice> I HUG CATS
<Ouroboros> Ah ok, thanks.
<RainbowDashSavior> im back
<CNreal> Am I able to catch up with this series somewhere, or is this purely for the livestream?
<Ouroboros> Did she loose her spear?
<Zacklego> Ghost trappers, They should have only one sound. "Are you my mummy?"
<Juice> Good thing nopony is saying "_________ is best pony!"
<Simon_Petrikov> Fluttershy is best pony@
<sub06905> ______ is best pony!
<Kammerjunk> Juice: That's because nopony is best pony. Except for Steven Magnet.
<cowvarkian> spike is best pony
<DerpyMuffins> I would suggest Past Sins after that male_writer
<Simon_Petrikov> hey look, I started playing Terraria :3
<RainbowDashSavior> line poni is best poni
<Rommulus> sub06905: oh you.
<Juice> Oh ****
<LeGoMeEGGO> Rarity is best chatroom
<Kammerjunk> I still think this chat needs more fabulosity.
<[Alpha]> http://i.imgur.com/Vwflr.jpg
<male_writer> oh, okay DerpyMuffins.
<sub06905> applejack is best background pony!
<Zacklego> Ghost trapper mummy is best mummy
<sub06905> :P
<coinflip2> male_writer: yes, Past Sins is really good, and also Equestria From Dust.
<Juice> Who HATES Rd?
<LeGoMeEGGO> CNreal: youtube has lots of episodes if you just search
<cowvarkian> are you my mummy? Zacklego
<male_writer> I love all the ponies, it is hard for me to choose which one is my favorite
<LadyCanary> Also, Happy Birthday to Stan the Man Lee ^_^
<CrystalPhoenix> Past Sins is overrated
<String_Shredder> Juice why would you say nopony? Nobody here's a pony.
<CNreal> LeGoMeEGGO: Am currently searching
<Kammerjunk> I never read Past Sins, really. Too occupied waiting for A Changing Perspective to update.
<Juice> It's a saying
<Shizuka> 13String_Shredder: says you
<male_writer> I would say this, I will read those fanfics, but FimFiction puts Fanfiction's fanfics to sleep
<coinflip2> CrystalPhoenix: ya it gets a lot of hype, it's still good though
<LadyCanary> Shizu Shizu.
<amatobrony> on the internet nopony knows youre a pony
<sub06905> the food probably aged well
<Shizuka> 13~<3
<clydesdale> So, what movies are tonight?
<String_Shredder> I didn't know you were here Shizuka. You're obviously a pony.
<Juice> Anypony HATE RD?
<LadyCanary> clydesdale: Look on the homepage.
<Tovler> I'll have youtube read Past Sins to me.
<Kammerjunk> Juice: I don't hate her, but I think she's more cute than awesome.
<Juice> Ok
<Juice> I despise her
<LadyCanary> Cool bro.
<Dauven> Juice: Why exactly?
<male_writer> Hey, leave RD alone, there is nothing wrong with her.
<LeGoMeEGGO> i love all the ponies, just some more than others
<twilight_sprinkle> inb4 its because of that jousting ep bit with fluttershy
<coinflip2> "The Best Night Ever" and "This Platinum Crown" are the best fics I have ever read.
<LadyCanary> How about we dont complain about best/worst pony.
<Dauven> male_writer: Well, what's wrongv with him having an opinion?
<Kammerjunk> http://derpy.me/38cJU How can you say no to that face?
<Juice> Dauven: She's always admires herself.
<LadyCanary> Please. It's so passe.
<RainbowDashSavior> the only fanfic iv ever read is draconequus and i read it out of boredom lol
<[Alpha]> ...
<Dauven> All I want is to understand why he doesn't like her.
<cowvarkian> Dauven: probably some silly reason
<Dauven> Juice: Of course she does. Her character is an archetype centered around being the best.
<LadyCanary> Everyone has their own opinion. To each their own.
<male_writer> well, nothing wrong with it. I apologize
<Juice> Kammerjunk: I'll smash her face
<Dauven> AND knowing it.
<Dauven> Twilight is similar to Rainbow Dash in that she's the best, but is humble about it.
<twilight_sprinkle> Juice: and who is your favorite?
<RainbowDashSavior> damn lagg
<Kammerjunk> Juice: You should talk to Meanwhile some day. Just ask him about Trixie and you two should be set.
<Tovler> darn. I can't use interpuncts in nicknames
<Juice> twilight_sprinkle: Pinkie Pie
<pyrocatboy> Juice well I'll steal your face
<Dauven> But Rainbow Dash's personality is such so that she constantly STRIVES to be the best.
<Mr> thereb is no best pont or worst pony there is only opinions
*pyrocatboy steals Juice 's face
<coinflip2> what's everybody's favorite shipping for fanfics? mine is Rarishy. And I HATE Flutterdash.
<Dauven> It'd be hard to carry that same archetype if she wasn't at least a little bit full of herself.
<Java> Mr: true
<thelonecubone|MW2> pyrocatboy: can i have some of his face?
<pyrocatboy> yes
<cowvarkian> Mr: there are only opinions
<cowvarkian> not there is
<LadyCanary> Wrek is now the man
<cowvarkian> well, their
<cowvarkian> not there
*LadyCanary air quotes
*Juice steals pyrocatboy's face
<Mr> my keyboard is very sensitive please forgive my writin
<twilight_sprinkle> no its there
<cowvarkian> Mr: its fine
<Dauven> Juice: Plus, it's not always straight up being full of herself. Being the best is of such importance to her that she's sometimes stricken with doubt, or even self depreciation.
<twilight_sprinkle> their is someone's
<Mr> *8writing
*Juice get's the HATE list
*pyrocatboy becomes pyroSlendeRboy
<LadyCanary> Too late for that.
*Kammerjunk crickets
<Flyboy> well hi guys, long time no see! is this fallout 3 or new vegas?
<cowvarkian> Dauven: so, she's a commedian?
<Kammerjunk> Oh, no. I just lagged.
<Dauven> -Shrug.- It kinda' baffles me to think that most people think Rarity's like, the only complex character in the show.
<CNreal> LeGoMeEGGO: Can't find anything. What did you type into the search to find this?
<pyroSlendeRboy> v
*Juice adds RD fans
<Dauven> This is New Vegas, Flyboy!
<Flyboy> kewl
<thelonecubone|MW2> ah sweet, A revolver c:
<coinflip2> Juice: at least she showed some humility in wonderbolt academy.
<LeGoMeEGGO> CNreal: you're looking for MLP episodes right?
<Dauven> Juice: Rainbow Dash is like, not even in my top 3, bro.
<CNreal> LeGoMeEGGO: er... no
<RainbowDashSavior> time to drench my keyboard in isoproyll alcohol
*pyroSlendeRboy starts stalking Juice
<LadyCanary> Cool bro.
<LadyCanary> and guys, stop with the RP.
<Dauven> Juice: It makes me sad and amused at the same time that some bronies have hate lists.
<Kammerjunk> Juice: Wait, HATE?
<LeGoMeEGGO> CNreal: oh, my mistake, well then i have no idea. sorry bud
<Dauven> Kammerjunk: Right?
<CNreal> LeGoMeEGGO: lol it's kk. Imma just sit back and watch then.
<Kammerjunk> "HATE. Let me tell you how much I've come to HATE you since I began to live."
*Juice changes "HATE List" to "secret dislike list"
<JAG_01> It takes a lot for me to genuinely hate something. Basically, you have to screw up REALLY bad for me to hate.
<Rex_Mundi> Kammerjunk: I have no mouth yet i must scream
<[Alpha]> http://i.imgur.com/tsJNb.jpg Eeemmeegerd
<male_writer> Well, HATE is a strong word, let us just say strongly dislike
<Dauven> JAG_01: I can't hate anyone for a screw up. O:
<JAG_01> Usually, if I don't like something, I just don't care.
<coinflip2> I hate nopony.
<Kammerjunk> Rex_Mundi: That's the one.
<thelonecubone|MW2> Kammerjunk: now you reminded me of the dave chappelle with the haters ball skit
<Flyboy> so who is actually streaming?
<LadyCanary> Wrek is
<Simon_Petrikov> Wrek
<Juice> Ugh, It's like people harrass me for hating PooDiePie
<coinflip2> Wrek
<cowvarkian> saturn
<Rex_Mundi> lord Wrek
<Kammerjunk> thelonecubone|MW2: Oh, lol.
<RainbowDashSavior> i heard that the mlp/Phoenix wright crossover is 98% complete
<Dauven> I don't really hate anything or anyone! Even stuff I find absolutely AWFUL I can still find amusement or beauty in it for the sake that it's a pinnacle of badness-
<Dauven> Take Rebecca Black's Friday, for example.
<LadyCanary> OI.
<Dauven> Absolutely horrible, all of it.
<Tovler> I'm waiting for Children of the Night.
<coinflip2> Dauven: same!
<Flyboy> Wrek: can i see that assassin suit your wearing? I wanna know if its the one i think it is
<LadyCanary> That lovely mess of a turd sammich.
<Dauven> Every part of it. But do I still love it? YES.
<[Alpha]> :P
<Tovler> I'm told that I'm supposed to hate Justin Bieber.
<Kammerjunk> Juice: The worst part of anything is always the loudest. And to be fair, PewDiePie and Tobuscus have some of the loudest fan followings I've seen.
<Rex_Mundi> Lord Wrek, Gamer extrordinare, master of the saucy sexy pony art. Mod of Bronystate.
<male_writer> Inded Dauven, it is catchy
<RainbowDashSavior> @Dauven same
<CNreal> Dauven: I agree.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> whenever i stand up from my pc desk I forget I have headphones attached to my computer and they get ripped out of the socket.
<Dauven> =D!
<Juice> Eeyup
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and I also kick my flash drive thats sticking out of the front, and usually bend and bust it off the contacts.
<male_writer> There are terrible songs out there, but I think what makes the song good although it is bad is the catchiness in it
<Mr_Kopple> is everyone alking about everything apart from the stream?
<Kammerjunk> Wrek, you're rousin' up your stream and play those games hard. 'Cause hell broke loose in BronyState and ChanServ deals the cards.
<Rex_Mundi> Wrek, slugs are like rifle rounds fired out of shotguns
<Dauven> I don't think that's what makes it good!
<LeGoMeEGGO> Mr_Kopple: yes
<Dauven> It's just.. I watched it while I was tripping?
<Mr_Kopple> lol
<JAG_01> Like I said, you'd have to REALLY try to get me to hate, and not just ignore you.
<male_writer> oh, okay
<Dauven> And every aspect of that song carries across the same feeling to the viewer.
<Juice> I hope this topic ends soon
<coinflip2> Tovler: Indeed. That's what we have all been told. It is our decision whether to harbour those feelings or not.
<cowvarkian> Dauven: you watch alot of things while high, don't you
<CNreal> Does anybody know if Wrek uploads these sessions somewhere?
<Kammerjunk> Mr_Kopple: On BronyState, we're always talking about everything except what's actually going on.
<LeGoMeEGGO> Kammerjunk: except if its MLP episode
<cowvarkian> LeGoMeEGGO: especcially then
<cowvarkian> *especially
<Kammerjunk> LeGoMeEGGO: Well, if an episode is live, the chat moves too quickly for me to see what the hay we're talking about.
<Kammerjunk> So I hide.
<coinflip2> LeGoMeEGGO: exactly
*Juice starts saying his thoughts on everything
<Afflict> I always trip on my headphones whenever I leave my computer
<pyroSlendeRboy> Glory to the Terran Republic.
<Kammerjunk> Juice: Everything is pretty big, you know.
<Juice> Kammerjunk: Eeyup
<LeGoMeEGGO> my reading speed has improved 20% by trying to read everything on chat during an episode
<Amu-chan> I've set my workspace up in such a way that despite my clumsiness, I don't bump into or harm my hardware when I move from my seat.
<pyroSlendeRboy> Kammerjunk That what she said.
<CNreal> Kammerjunk: it's not THAT big
<Kammerjunk> pyroSlendeRboy: I kind of had that coming.
<pyroSlendeRboy> yep
<Juice> I'll start small Bronystate is the blablablabla secrets

<RainbowDashSavior> le chips
<cowvarkian> yes
<thelonecubone|MW2> no Fallout NV
<male_writer> What CNreal, Cupcakes?
<moonslicer> oh well happy nightmares for me
<thelonecubone|MW2> dead money expansion
<moonslicer> bye everypony im on tomorrow!
<LeGoMeEGGO> OC-outlaws: its dead space
<RainbowDashSavior> cya moon
<moonslicer> bye
<thelonecubone|MW2> Bye moonslicer
<moonslicer> bye
<OC-outlaws> ahhh, that was another choice i had. quite fancy playing fallout
<JuiceTheHuman> I LIKE CATS
<CNreal> male_writer: yeah. I read it, saw the reactions, and I wanted to be just as terrified.
<Kammerjunk> ^
<Kammerjunk> Not how I got into the fandom, though.
<JuiceTheHuman> One time I saw rainbow milk
<Kammerjunk> But reading that thing was just silly.
<male_writer> well, I think the video is for frightening than the fanfiction
<RainbowDashSavior> I have never read cupcakes, and never will.
<JuiceTheHuman> I was like "MUHAHAHAHAHAH"|
<RainbowDashSavior> Never.
<JuiceTheHuman> RainbowDashSavior: READ IT
<Tovler> so far, the only fanfic I've read was My Little Dash. It was hilarious.
<CNreal> Kammerjunk: It works for others, bvecause the bad writing is made up with our vivid imaginations
<CNreal> because*
<RainbowDashSavior> NEVER!
<Mr_Kopple> i saw the vido it was funny till the bad part...
<JuiceTheHuman> READ IT
<cowvarkian> simplest Wrek
<JuiceTheHuman> NAO
<twilight_sprinkle> simplest, Wrek
<RainbowDashSavior> no....STAHP
<JAG_01> "Find Dog in the simplest of beasts"
<twilight_sprinkle> simplests of beasts i think
<Flyboy> Wrek: it says find dog in the simplest of beasts
<JuiceTheHuman> RainbowDashSavior: Read. it
<Kammerjunk> If at first you don't succeed, shoot it.
<JuiceTheHuman> If you don't read it, watch it
<male_writer> No, I recommend read it, not watch it.
<JuiceTheHuman> I enjoyed both
<Dauven> I have a feeling Wrek has played this expansion before.
<male_writer> Watching it gave me the heeby geebies
<pyroSlendeRboy> The god is dog
<RainbowDashSavior> iv watched a few seconds of it, but couldn't watch anymore
<RainbowDashSavior> just no.
<JuiceTheHuman> I Loved the part where RD died
<male_writer> That music
<CNreal> So... something unrelated, when you see somthing funny in, say a conversation, what would you say: "lol" or "wow"
<JuiceTheHuman> YOU'RE GONNA GET READY TO DIE
<RainbowDashSavior> why do people even make those dark fanfics for lol
<cowvarkian> CNreal: both
<CNreal> JuiceTheHuman: godamnit Juice
<JuiceTheHuman> CNreal: What?
<Kammerjunk> CNreal: Depends on where I hold that conversation.
<Cypresswolf> shock value, RainbowDashSavior
<male_writer> Cypresswolf: very true.
<Kammerjunk> CNreal: If in real life, I'll laugh. Even if it's a fake laugh.
<CNreal> Kammerjunk: I prefer LoL over WoW.
<male_writer> Has anyone seen the .MOV videos on youtube, like SHED.MOV?
<RainbowDashSavior> @CNreal ild say lol because saying wow makes you look like an asshole imo
<JAG_01> And that's why I avoid Cupcakes. Not a fan of shock material.
<Kammerjunk> CNreal: o u
<JuiceTheHuman> I LOVE SHED.MOV
<CNreal> WoW seems like a bit much to say
<LadyCanary> Please dont talk about the .movs...
<LadyCanary> >_>
<male_writer> Why does everything almost happen to Dash though, and I mean everything bad in those horror fanfics or videos?
<p3gu1n> wow- world of warcraft?
<coinflip2> RainbowDashSavior: me either. I read a fanfic that was really good (it was a flutterdash shipping) but right at the end RD died, and then Fluttershy killed herself. I was in depression for months, and still sort of am because of that. It was really well written though. It's called "The Walls". Read it if you dare. (and the disturbing ending is only an alternate ending, so don't read the alternate ending if you don't want to be d
<JuiceTheHuman> I can't wait til SWAG.MOV
<Flyboy> male_writer: i dunno, people just dont like dash for some reason, dont see why.
<Flyboy> male_writer: i may be wrong though
<Tovler> the .movs seem like a distant memory.
<CNreal> p3gu1n: which do you prefer to say when you see something funny, like in a conversation: LoL or WoW?
<Dauven> That was just a joke, right?
<LadyCanary> Wrek <3
<Cypresswolf> one of the first pony fics I read - before I ever heard about the fic that shant be named - had Rarity as a rich fashion pony kidnapping other ponies to make her dresses
<CNreal> Did Wrek just talk to the chat?
<Dauven> Seemed kind of mean spirited, Wrek.
<Kammerjunk> Welp, we were all thinking it, but Wrek said it.
<male_writer> I mean doesn't the people who do write these fanfics or make these videos that it will draw a negative outlook on MLP though?
<Flyboy> Wrek: thats an... erm... Interesting view you have there
<RainbowDashSavior> @coinflip2:LOL NOPE
<JuiceTheHuman> VVVE VVVILL DIE
<RainbowDashSavior> not reading it
<SuperSanjitenks1989> Happy Friday!
<LadyCanary> Dauven: Nah he jokes around, mostly.
<Dauven> Was gonna' say.
<Cypresswolf> The dresses were ponies
<p3gu1n> CNreal: um "thats fucking halarious
<p3gu1n> *"
<SuperSanjitenks1989> Fallout 3 or New Vegas?
<JuiceTheHuman> Use V instead of W
<Dauven> Sitting in judgment of others? PROBABLY A RAAAAARITY FAN
<Kammerjunk> SuperSanjitenks1989: NV. Dead Money.
<Reallylikehermane> These aren't ponies D:
<pyroSlendeRboy> seems legit
<CNreal> p3gu1n: I prefer LoL over WoW. WoW seems like a tad much.
<cowvarkian> Dauven: how did you know
<Dauven> Level 10 hypocrisy right there.
<male_writer> and the .MOV videos make the ponies look, how can I say this kindly, not unattractive
<WeatherPony1> derp...
<JuiceTheHuman> Why is the stream buffering?
<Cypresswolf> I couldnt tell you what that one was called - one of Equestria Daily's earliest fanfic posts
<Mr_Kopple> i never did like rarity
<SuperSanjitenks1989> the one who wrote that was wrong
<male_writer> I mean unattractive*
<Kammerjunk> Christine's smelling something good.
<RainbowDashSavior> *blacklists "the walls" keyword in the ip settings*
<SuperSanjitenks1989> I saw a Swag.mov preview.
<coinflip2> MR_Kopple: but... Rarity is best pony...
<male_writer> And good grief, in the .MOV they give Fluttershy Fat Albet's voice
<JuiceTheHuman> Me too
<male_writer> Albert*
<Flyboy> the only pony i dont really like is pinkie. she reminds me of all the attention seekers i get at school. although i dont hate her.
<penguin> what the hell i just got kicked?
<JuiceTheHuman> Which Pinkie?
<LadyCanary> -_-
<JuiceTheHuman> .mov or REAL?
<penguin> cowvarkian: dude i got kicked?
<RainbowDashSavior> Flyboy: but.. but...
<Reallylikehermane> Pinkie is awesome. :(
<cowvarkian> penguin: apaprently
<cowvarkian> *apparently
<RainbowDashSavior> smile smile smile :'(
<JuiceTheHuman> SMILE SMILE SMILE:O
<String_Shredder> Frown frown frown.
<RainbowDashSavior> gak gak gak
<JuiceTheHuman> SMILE SMILE SMILE:O
<JuiceTheHuman> GAK is fun
<Dauven> Yap yap yap!
<String_Shredder> nope nope nope.
<Tovler> fill my gut up with moonshine moonshine
<Flyboy> RainbowDashSavior: trust me, i have nothing against her. she just brings up memories of assholes at school because of the way she... is...
<OC-outlaws> dammit still waiting for the last .MOV ..... HURRY IT UP WILL YA!
<CNreal> I think things happen to Rainbow Dash, because she's really Daring.
<coinflip2> Smile smile smile always puts me in a good mood. :)
<Dauven> What does everyone mean "things happen to Rainbow Dash?
<male_writer> Who would want to compete with Pinkie in a speed talking contest?
<JuiceTheHuman> coinflip2: It puts me in a good mood too
<Dauven> male_writer: My friend Norris would! He likes to rap though.
<JuiceTheHuman> male_writer: Uhhhh........ a pony
<male_writer> Dauven, she gets killed in those horror related fanfics or videos.
<coinflip2> JuiceTheHuman: /)
<J_E_Smith71> male_writer: The Micro Machine man
<Dauven> Like, freestyle rapping and stuff.
<JuiceTheHuman> (\
<male_writer> I would be honored to go against her
<RainbowDashSavior> if i had to rate every mlp canon song in order from 1 to 20 or so, i wouldn't be able to even get the first 2 down lol
<Dauven> male_writer: Whoa, I didn't know that. Probably because the character who is the most full of themselves is usually one of the soonest to go in a horror movie?
<SilverLining> hello
<[Alpha]> Cool Fallout 3
<cowvarkian> Wrek: he's not in the sierra madre
<JuiceTheHuman> IEATCUPCAKESDOYOULIKECUPCAKESCAUSEILOVECUPCAKES
<Kammerjunk> Jesus, am I the only one didn't go to a school with bullies?
<coinflip2> hi SilverLining
<Flyboy> [Alpha]: nope, new vegas
<male_writer> Well, yea, that is true Dauven
<cowvarkian> Kammerjunk: I didn't/ I'm not
<coinflip2> Kammerjunk: ME:)
<CNreal> [Alpha]: Actually,... yeah what Flyboy said
<Dauven> Kammerjunk: Probably! My school had bullies!
<[Alpha]> oh I forgot they visually look the same
<String_Shredder> lel: http://cheezburger.com/6908081920
<Tovler> No, but, I played a Mario game with bullet bills, so… there's that.
<JuiceTheHuman> Is the stream buffering for you guys?
<LadyCanary> Kammerjunk: I had been bullied from 1st to 8th grade. And JuiceTheHuman, try refreshing
<RainbowDashSavior> smile smile smile is still best song tho lol
<JuiceTheHuman> Ok
<JuiceTheHuman> RainbowDashSavior: CORRECT
<Reallylikehermane> Whats wrong with your face?
<male_writer> all the songs are good to me. :)
<coinflip2> male_writer: same! ;)
<cowvarkian> Reallylikehermane: he's a hundred something year old super mutant
<Dauven> Do you guys think all bronies smell bad? Or just me?
<Java> Reallylikehermane: Pie incident?
<male_writer> I love the Cupcake song Pinkie sings to Apple Bloom in "Call of the Cutie"
<RainbowDashSavior> lol Dauven
<JAG_01> "So, you opened my cage for a rea-..." GOLF AD!
<cowvarkian> Dauven: you're probably right
<coinflip2> Dauven: Idk, I've never met one in real life. ;)
<Java> JAG_01: Go get adblock or ghostery
<JAG_01> Can't. Borrowed comp.
<RainbowDashSavior> rofl
<Java> JAG_01: Oh, sorry
<cowvarkian> JAG_01: I'm sure they won't mind
<Kammerjunk> And you won't like him when he's angry.
<male_writer> I just hope though in the show, they keep Spike small, but only grow with age.
<SilverLining> what game is this?
<Java> cowvarkian: No dude, there's an unwritten rule not to install something to someone comp without their permission.
<thelonecubone|MW2> fallout NV
<coinflip2> male_writer: ya spike just wouldn't be spike if he grew up.
<Kammerjunk> SilverLining: Fallout: New Vegas. The Dead Money DLC.
<SilverLining> cool
<cowvarkian> Java: I break that rule all the time
<male_writer> thank you coinflip2
<Sinestro> so its wall-e that starts in 2hrs?

<Java> Saturn: What kind of chocolate?

<Dauven> Saturn: Really? I mean...
<male_writer> my favorite line though has to be "YOU"RE GOING TO LOVE ME!" from Fluttershy
<Tovler> a chocoduck. kill two birds with one stone
<Dauven> Saturn: I don't think fucking a duck will help with that, but.. If you say so.
<CNreal> He ate a collar WHOLE?
<LadyCanary> Hiya Saturn
<Dauven> Saturn: You're the mod.
<LeGoMeEGGO> how do you eat something around your neck?
<coinflip2> male_writer: yes, that was a classix
<coinflip2> classic*
<String_Shredder> I think I'll pass on the fucking of a duck, Saturn.
<Java> CNreal: It taste like metal....
<AdamTheDuck> o.O

<Dauven> Dude, do you guys wanna' pick what I eat from Taco Bell?
<Kammerjunk> Frosting, man.
<JuiceTheHuman> Especialy Cupcakes HD
<Tovler> adding salt to Pepsi makes it taste a little more like Coke.
<male_writer> Taco Bell Rocks!
<Java> JuiceTheHuman: Blueberry muffin to be exact
<RainbowDashSavior> 6_9
<coinflip2> Dauven: Mexican Food is heavenly, though not as heavenly as Chinese
<[Alpha]> Dorito Loco
<JuiceTheHuman> I don't like muffins
<Dauven> Chinese is too much money for me right now, coinflip2!
<male_writer> oh, coinflip, you are right about that
<Tovler> Chorizo
<Dauven> Otherwise I would.
<JuiceTheHuman> They have grey feathers in them
<Kammerjunk> Tovler: Adding Coca Cola to Pepsi makes it taste a little more like Coca Cola.
<[Alpha]> Taco Bell isn't mexican food
<Java> I think I will try to make fried rice today.
<RainbowDashSavior> there isnt even 1 fast food mexican place in australia lol
<male_writer> Love Chinese Food!
<cowvarkian> Dauven: but taco bell isn't even real mexican food
<JuiceTheHuman> I always have to spit the gray feathers out
<coinflip2> Dauven: Isn't it always! :)
<Dauven> cowvarkian: I know! But it's got uh.

<Dauven> Does strikethrough work here?
<Dauven> [s]strikethrough[/s]
<thelonecubone|MW2> ?
<Dauven> I was gonna' do something silly.
<Java> Dauven: I don't think this cat room allows those commands.
<Tovler> Kammerjunk: and adding half and half to skim milk makes it tastes more like whole milk.
<Dauven> Cat room?
<Dauven> ... Oh, chat room of course.
<coinflip2> lol
<Java> Dauven: Meaow
<Dauven> I got a Rainbow Dash hoodie from Hot Topic for Christmas.

<Dauven> Oh gosh.
<coinflip2> omai
<Dauven> Nevermind. Not gonna' discuss NSFW stuff.
<Dauven> All I'll say is that I saw like the most ridiculous rule 34 for ponies I've ever..
<LadyCanary> Good idea.
<Dauven> I don't even.
<JuiceTheHuman> I thought FS's name was: Ugly piece of shit
<Tovler> Jacqueline Fiona Apple
<Kammerjunk> I thought Fluttershy's name was Fluttershy.
<Dauven> And I thought JuiceTheHuman's real name was: Types-Slow-Like-Molasses.
<Dauven> Get it?
<Dauven> 'Cause you're Native American?
<Mr_Kopple> god mode activate *srints awa*
<JuiceTheHuman> Nope

<Algent> think*
<LeGoMeEGGO> JuiceTheHuman: I don't understand why you are making this much argument
<Dauven> Yeah, you're Native American. c:
<JuiceTheHuman> I though Dauven's real name was: Mr. Meanie Pants

<Dauven> Finally completed my doctorate.
*JuiceTheHuman adds Bronystate to the "Sites that make me depressed"
<Kammerjunk> Again?
<CNreal> JuiceTheHuman: O///O
<LadyCanary> -________________--
<JuiceTheHuman> ??
<CNreal> JuiceTheHuman: blushing face
<Dauven> How could this site make you depressed? :c
<JuiceTheHuman> Dauven: CLASSIFIED
<Dauven> JuiceTheHuman: Is there anything I can do to help you feel better? c:
<Kammerjunk> That reminds me of the list I have about things I don't care about aptly titled "List of Things I Don't Care About." It stopped at entry 61 when I added the list itself.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Animation: Skydance
<coinflip2> Kammerjunk: :D
<Dauven> Kammerjunk: Sounds like the whole list was a bit of an oxymoron, good thing you stopped making it.
<Tovler> Now I'm reminded of the song: My Favorite Things
<CNreal> Could you put that in a memo...
<Kammerjunk> Dauven: It was 3 AM. I didn't have much to do.
<CNreal> now someone finifh it
<cowvarkian> Kammerjunk: sleep?

<Dauven> Sleep is usually a viable option, yeah.
<Kammerjunk> cowvarkian: Haha what.

<RainbowDashSavior> TOOK OUR JEWBS
<SilverLining> well i'll be back in a couple hours. ta ta for now
<Dauven> Seeing as what?
<Dauven> Oh.
*Juice makes a shit-ton of rainbow cupcakes
<Dauven> I'd never heard of the fanfic! x43
<coinflip2> Dauven: probably becuase of the fanfic title cupcakes.
<CNreal> Wrek: yeah and F:NV is allowed. rofl
<Kammerjunk> Dauven: Just FYI, there's a FAQ section as well as a Rules one.
<LadyCanary> Good, Dauven.
<Dauven> I just thought like, talk of cupcakes was off limits.
*Juice gives Dauven a rainbow cupcake
<DoctoDoctorWho> I cant eat cupcakes anymore, its more of a choice
<Java> the fanfic cupcake is old and tiresome. It's getting overused.
*Dauven saves the cupcake for after Taco Bell.
<LadyCanary> Personally, I prefer Red Velvet.
<J_E_Smith71> Dauven: Do yourself a favor and don't look it up
<Dauven> Can we go ahead and-
<RainbowDashSavior> USE HOTSPOT SHIELD
<RainbowDashSavior> -

<Kammerjunk> All caps makes it all the better.
<Java> I prefer blueberry cupcake :p
<Ralathon> Fallout New Vegas I see.
<BlankFlank> Is that even a real cupcake?
<Kammerjunk> I really do prefer cupcakes over muffins. It's the frosting, you see.
<Tovler> I like green tea cupcakes
<coinflip2> Kammerjunk: it always does.
<kully6745> OMG LOL
<Dauven> ... Did they really have horsemeat in them?
<Kammerjunk> Tovler: You've never had blueberry cupcakes?!
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dauven: You can do what you want but you have been warned.
<LeGoMeEGGO> horsemeat cupcakes?
<smrtgy1> Hello everypony :)
<LadyCanary> Tovler: Oh my lord that sounds yummy. AND EW..

<cowvarkian> hacking = clicking randomly
<cowvarkian> it's been scientificly proven
<PhoenixBrony> DAMN
<Alchemist> why is he reading every line and not just the words?
<Hubson> EVERYTHING
<Kammerjunk> cowvarkian: That's not even the start of it. Have you seen how Hollywood thinks computers work?
<twilight_sprinkle> thinks pro bably
<cowvarkian> lel yeah Kammerjunk
<twilight_sprinkle> *probably
<Sinestro> >2 Spike Eps >0 Rarity Eps
<Michael> you can always re-entry the computer
<Sinestro> god why
<Kammerjunk> What about THINKS?
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<cowvarkian> Sinestro: I though we had one
<RainbowDashSavior> theres this message flashing saying : "flash policy problem" above the chat.. halp
<penguin> what the hell does hollywood know
<cowvarkian> but also, spike is best pony
<Michael> spike is not a pony :p
<PhoenixBrony> Looks tasty
<PhoenixBrony> >:D
<Kammerjunk> cowvarkian: Except for Steven Magnet.
<cowvarkian> penguin: how to make shit look cool, while being ridiculously inaccurate
<Kammerjunk> God bless that fabulous bastard.
<cowvarkian> Michael: thats the joke
<Sinestro> a rarity ep? i dont think so
<J_E_Smith71> RainbowDashSavior: That's weird usually the Flash policy problem thing blocks me out of the chat
<penguin> yeah sounds about right
<DoctoDoctorWho> We had 2 spike eps?
<cowvarkian> Kammerjunk: true
<Sinestro> 2 upcoming
<cowvarkian> DoctoDoctorWho: the one where he ran away, and the one coming up
<Michael> cowvarkian: then discord is best pony
<Sinestro> this weeks is one

<Tom> Episode 10 of season 3 "Spike at Your Service" airs in 0 days, 16 hours, 43 minutes, 5 seconds (Dec 29 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<Alchemist> Rarity had enough screen time, shedoesnt need another ep now imo.

<Michael> ohai thelonecubone|MW2 :p
<LeGoMeEGGO> woohoo
<DoctoDoctorWho> We need a princess ep
<Sinestro> just that its clearly a spike ep

<LeGoMeEGGO> DoctoDoctorWho: we really do
<PhoenixBrony> DoctoDoctorWho: Eyup.
<Michael> not a bad gun
<Tovler> Applejack needs to play catch-up
<Sinestro> fallout works fine unless you mod the shit out of it
<cowvarkian> DoctoDoctorWho: or an episode that explains why there are only princesses, and no actual real monarchical system
<Alchemist> penguin: no one?
<magmablock> I have a bunch of tiny mods
<Kammerjunk> Sinestro: It's a Bethesda game. For PC.
<Michael> i want a rarity EP
<penguin> Alchemist: no someone just did
<RainbowDashSavior> Spoiler to next episode: scroll up for it
<Kammerjunk> Sinestro: It's almost mandatory to mod it.
<Sinestro> he shouldnt even have those guns
<PhoenixBrony> Who cares about explanations? I want more Luna D:
<J_E_Smith71> cowvarkian: Well Faust did want Celestia to be a queen but Hasbro forced her to make her a princess I believe
<Hubson> I want to know if Celestia is a godlike being
<kidzrul732> no RainbowDashSavior NO!
<Alchemist> penguin: I havent seen anything besides the obvious "it will have spike in it".
<Sinestro> thats probly the only flaw i had with Deadmoney, the guns they forced you to use sucked
<[Alpha]> We already know Discord is
<magmablock> My most game-chaning mod is one that lets you repair armor and weapons with scrap metal
<RainbowDashSavior> o

<Sinestro> Rarity deserves all the episodes
<RainbowDashSavior> alpha just spoilt it
<DoctoDoctorWho> cowvarkian: Episode summary: *opening theme* Disney and hasbro are bitches! *end*
