<MahBoi777> :D
<Shizuka> 13hundreds of permutations...
<Shizuka> 13gate has some 36 symbols, need 6 for an address
<By-tor> smooches :D
<Shizuka> 13way way more than hundreds possible
*The_4th_Wall likes permutations
<MrMaxaminus> yeah hundreds sounds like a few orders of magnitude off.
<Sumica> 00,10quick run the numbers Shizuka
<MahBoi777> recalculating...
<Cypresswolf> would the amount of coordinates for the stagate be 36^6?
<TOY_PON3|TF2> Sumica: I love you
<Sumica> 00,10damn we need steven to do the math for us.
*TOY_PON3|TF2 got a strange Liberty Launcher
<The_4th_Wall> WHOOOAH
<By-tor> ohaaaaaw
<Sumica> 00,10Nice TOY_PON3|TF2
<Shizuka> 13oh milky way has 39..
<TOY_PON3|TF2> :)
<Shizuka> 13so....
<MahBoi777> I haven't seen Steven in 5 days, how is he? lol
*Sumica has no idea what that is.
<Shizuka> 1339 nPr 6
<Sumica> 00,10I suppose you will use it on me at some point.
<Dark_Horst> yes sam, you said that already
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON3|TF2: AMERICA! F:[ YEA!
<Shizuka> 132,349,088,560 possible addresses in milky way
<TOY_PON3|TF2> Indeed
<Dark_Horst> it's a PHONEBOOK
<Sumica> 00,10I got the lazer rocket launcher last night thanks to one of our nice viewers ^_^
<Shizuka> 13wrek gave me a strange ax today <3
<Phase4> hello again
<TOY_PON3|TF2> Nice
<Dark_Horst> A GIANT STARGATE PHONEBOOK
<Cypresswolf> 2,176,782,336 possible worlds @ 36^6
<TOY_PON3|TF2> hi Phase4
<MahBoi777> DAYUM, that's alotta adresses
<MahBoi777> ohai Phase4
<The_4th_Wall> SO MUCH MAIL
<Sumica> 00,10i wanted to play with you guys today.
<Cypresswolf> did they say 7 symbol codes?
<Ulthane> wow, just when i thought bronystate can't get any better, you guys start streaming SG-1 /)^3^(\
<Shizuka> 136 symbol address, 39 symbols available
<Sumica> 00,107 yes but one symbole stays the same.
<Shizuka> 13plus one for point of origin
<The_4th_Wall> Derpy's gonna be busy
<Shizuka> 13but that one's irrelevant cause it's unique to each gate
<MahBoi777> ^^indeed
*IshBestPony licks everypony
<Ulthane> there goes my sleep schedule...
<TOY_PON3|TF2> Now...Should I buy a hat, weapon, or misc?
<MahBoi777> HATS
<Placebo> TOY_PON3|TF2: Go nekkid.
<Shizuka> 13and we have a premise for a series!
<TOY_PON3|TF2> Placebo: <3
<Placebo> :3
<MahBoi777> need more hats TOY_PON3|TF2
<Phase4> from the discusion about stargate i gather the stream is either booring or stargate
<Dark_Horst> 6 symbols mark 3 axies in the 3d environment of the milky way, pinpointing the target location. the 7th marks the starting position
<Snakkkeeeeees> Ishbestpony Why I get licked? D:
<By-tor> Nuke all possible desinations. It's the only way to be sure.
<TOY_PON3|TF2> MahBoi777: I do need moar hats..
<Cypresswolf> 3,518,743,761 then @ 39^6
<IshBestPony> Snakkkeeeeees because ponies
<MahBoi777> LOL
*TOY_PON3|TF2 buys ALL the hats
<Shizuka> 13not exactly
<TOY_PON3|TF2> :3
<Shizuka> 13symbols never repeat
<Shizuka> 13and order matters
<Dark_Horst> an 8th symbol gets you into the pegasus galaxy and all 9 lead to the destiny
<Sumica> 00,10then they added the 8th, which is like dialing the area code first
<Dark_Horst> well, the books exclaimes that
<Phase4> its shooty time
<Shizuka> 13yeah 8 is a distance function
<Dark_Horst> so i'm gonna believe the books
<Shizuka> 139 was for specific gates
<MahBoi777> shooty wooty
<The_4th_Wall> PEW PEW PEW
<Pale_Horse> Pretty sure the number of permutations possible on a given stargate was found to be way, way way too insufficient to properly cover an area the size of a galaxy. Least that's what I heard.
<By-tor> THIS IS MY BOOMSPEAR ... .STICK ... . . thing
<Gamerfreak1143> hey guys
<Cypresswolf> so in essence, there's no limit to the number of connections
<Phase4> Shizuka: theres a function that does that, i THINK its factorial but i've never been good remembering words
<Sumica> 00,10bang bang, she shot me down.
<Shizuka> 13permutations
<Dark_Horst> i have a feeling the writers didn't quite think that stuff through when they first came up with it
<Shizuka> 1339 nPr 6 is the 2 billion number i said
*The_4th_Wall does drugs
<MrMaxaminus> Of course they would kidnap her.
<By-tor> Walmart
<pony_4951> Its 2349088560 combos
<Shizuka> 13brain all melty
<MahBoi777> remember kids, drugs are bad.
<pony_4951> for the 39 symbols without repeating
<TOY_PON3|TF2> I might buy Modest Pile of Hat
<TOY_PON3|TF2> Hmm..
<The_4th_Wall> Presccription
<Sumica> 00,10sleep sleep. poppies poppies.
<Snakkkeeeeees> mindrape

<pony_4951> symbols
<MrMaxaminus> How did the actors see with those helmets on?
<TOY_PON3|TF2> Hmm.
<Pale_Horse> "Poppies" is a euphimism for morphine...
<Aircrafter> Toy...You being playing Tf2?
<Shizuka> 13so that happened

<Phase4> i remember seeing the movie
<MrMaxaminus> Will it cost a lot of money to improve capacity here?
<Phase4> this does look like the movie
<TOY_PON3|TF2> Hmmm...Well I think about it, I will probably come across it. But then I never come across HATS...
<Dark_Horst> this is the pilot of the series
<Dark_Horst> which came right after the movie
<Sumica> 00,10we have plenty of room here.
<TOY_PON3|TF2> Plus I technically got a weapon already

<TOY_PON3|TF2> Hmmm...
<NightSeas> 12Hi Spyrorocks
*TOY_PON3|TF2 wonders if should buy Modest Pile of Hat
<Krakass> It only gestates in the intestines.
<The_4th_Wall> HE'S DEAD
<Dark_Horst> the larvaes get carried around usually by jaffa(the snake-heads) in belly pouches until they mature and can take an own host

<DaringDude> watrya watchin
<Sumica> 00,10jaffa in the trees
<jffry890> AA-12?
<Snakkkeeeeees> yup
<Kencolt> Stargate equestria has an AMAZING OP, if you hunt it down..
<By-tor> Ponies that carry a parasprite in their manes are granted long life.
<gold> princess celstia want to battle O.O
<gold> wants*
<Dark_Horst> the story is basically that sg1 came home from a botched mission but the stargate short-circuited, sending them to the planet of equestria, which had a stargate that was disconnected from the network but reconnected by the shortcurcuit
<RoflBot> guns > laser spears
<DaringDude> obviously
<Snakkkeeeeees> they work now
<Midnight_Tempest> g36 is best gun
<Dark_Horst> well, staff weapons are not made to kill people
<jffry890> its like ßigmacietnam
<Dark_Horst> they are made to make them piss their pants
<jffry890> wtf
<jffry890> vietnam*
<Snakkkeeeeees> too late everyone dies... end of story
<By-tor> Don't these people have Mortars or artillery? Has any of these "military" people even heard of a tank?
<DaringDude> sooo inaccurTE
<Krakass> Tanks don't fit through the gate.
<Kencolt> And O'Neill kind of... semi-freaks for the rest of the story. Semi. Because it's silly to his head.
<Sumica> 00,10hard to get a tank 20 stories below ground.
<By-tor> A tankette?
<Pale_Horse> LFG. Need tank.
<DaringDude> convinient rocks
*Midnight_Tempest becomes L4D Tank. RAAAAWWWRRR!!
<RoflBot> rofl
<RanDT2> No tank for you Pale..
<Snakkkeeeeees> Those thuds when things hit the Iris... they are nasty cause you can just imagine what's going on
<owlicious> no tanks?
<By-tor> Germans have a neat little mini tank that fires TOW2 missles. That'll ruin someones day.
*TOY_PON3|TF2 shoots at Midnight_Tempest
<Dark_Horst> oh, and it turns out that celestia and teal'c were in the same business
<By-tor> they seem rollin
*Midnight_Tempest throws a rock at TOY_PON3|TF2
*TOY_PON3|TF2 gets hit and is down
<Sumica> 00,10still love what jack calls the jaffa ponies
<Snakkkeeeeees> noooo bad timing for commercial
<Kencolt> Oh, and Daniel and Twilight have what can only be described as a Bromance. Even though Twi is a girl. But, well, there are limits.
<jffry890> awesome
<TOY_PON3|TF2> I'm down!
<DaringDude> not the women
<Pale_Horse> <--- someday wants to work rules combining MLP into Exalted.
*Midnight_Tempest charges up to TOY_PON3|TF2 and smashes him
<MahBoi777> MEDIC!
<By-tor> Awwww I'm hit low!
<IshBestPony> http://macromeme.com/dog/bill-nye-troll.html
<Snakkkeeeeees> USE THE M204
*Sumica hits TOY_PON3|TF2 with a medpack instead of using it on him.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> staffs don't kill people guns kill people
*TOY_PON3|TF2 dies
<RoflBot> Score Team 1 = in the 100s Team 2 = 1
<DaringDude> theyd be winning if they were using the ump45 supressed
<Dark_Horst> staffs aren't made to kill püeople
<Pale_Horse> Actually, staffs have killed a lot of people.
*Sumica morns the death of TOY_PON3|TF2 "he did't ask for this"
*MahBoi777 hits TOY_PON3|TF2 with a wrench to repair
<Bronyzilla> Okay, Im back now.

<Dark_Horst> staff weapons have the primary goal to inflict terror in the opposing factions m which are primarily quite primitive. the killing is a neat side ffect htoough
<Bronyzilla> Almost a man down!
<Snakkkeeeeees> ummm that iris is going to need cleaned
<Sumica> 00,10so do you think they have to wipe the back side of the iris off?
<TOY_PON3|TF2> Whoa!

<Midnight_Tempest> bugs on a windsheild...
<tymo> That's a morbid thought.

<Midnight_Tempest> i love that thought...
<Sumica> 00,10the technobable behind the iris is it's so close to the wormhole that you cant be rebuilt by the gate before you hit it.

<Kammerjunk> DeadpoolDash: Wrek is in Sweden.
<Placebo> TOY_PON3|TF2: I bonk'd you :3
<Boltasar> gaah, me neither, downloading it atm

<Kammerjunk> The Land of Metal.

<Placebo> Starflash: Just doesn't work for TF2?
<Dashie_Dashie|TF2> are ya holding down v?

<Kammerjunk> I have no idea what server you guys are on, so I'm just going to not try.
<Placebo> Enough TF2 for one night..
<Placebo> was SB64 even in there the last few games?
<Boltasar> nope
<Boltasar> he is playing MW3 if I am correct
<Placebo> Ew.
<Boltasar> yup
<Boltasar> Soo, I was wondering. Are there any Homestuck readers in this IRC?
<I_Am_Rarity> lol rebel yell
<Jim> Isn't the free trail of MW3 over? Think he said he won't be playing it
<Kammerjunk> I am 10 weapons away from a new hat. I must play more TF2 to gain more items.
<Placebo> I've heard of Homestuck a few times.
<Placebo> Looked it up once, didn't really see what the fuss was.
<I_Am_Rarity> Same here Placebo
<Kammerjunk> Does anypony know when the item count is reset?
<Jim> Does it ever reset? :o
<Placebo> ^
<Boltasar> I like homestuck. It makes me theorize sometimes, like YSNHDT did for me.
<Placebo> Sinfest is best webcomic.
<I_Am_Rarity> I dont really like webcomics
<Boltasar> I am still pondering if you can count mspa comics as comics, it is not that the text is in the pics. More like a childs book, with a pic for every page.
<I_Am_Rarity> Is it wierd that I am attracted to Rainbow Dash?
*Jim hnnnnnngs
<Placebo> I'm off to bed. Night everyone.

<StickySyrup> Hello everypony =)
<Jim> ohai StickySyrup
<StickySyrup> hey
<TOY_PON3> Why why would she pop up in my head so randomly?!
<StickySyrup> Just finished the 6th chapter for my fanfic... omg its getting good XD

<StickySyrup> TOY_PON3: lol saw u playing lastnight.. loved it
<StickySyrup> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/8662/The-Power-of-Stars
<TOY_PON3> StickySyrup: Thanks
<Phase4> sounds interesting
<TOY_PON3> Maybe...maybe I miss her...
<CupcakeWarrior> Sounds good
<TOY_PON3> But she was evil why would I miss her?!
<StickySyrup> Phase4: Its taken me a while, and it may not have many views, but im loving writing it
<RainbowJack> bye bye erverypony
<Scavender> Time for me to get back to work, see you later guys.
<TOY_PON3> C'mon somepony help me out abit, Do I bring her back into my life or do I leave her out?
<OneTrickPony> bye RainbowJack and Scavender
<StickySyrup> byebye
<StickySyrup> yeah.. I should probablly have some breakfast now... its nearly 12pm
<StickySyrup> il see you all in a bit
<OneTrickPony> bye StickySyrup
<StickySyrup> ^^
<TOY_PON3> C'mon anypony please
<OneTrickPony> I have no idea what you r talking about
<nido> at the risk of not being able to answer (given I'm at work), who is this she
<TOY_PON3> OneTrickPony: I think I miss my ex gf, I'm thinking should I let her back into my life or should I keep her out.
<OneTrickPony> move on
<OneTrickPony> it will do you better
*TOY_PON3 looks down
<TOY_PON3> I still like her...
*Phase4 never wants to dislike someone enough to cut them out of his life
<OneTrickPony> who broke up with who?
<TOY_PON3> But I'm a fool to think that, knowing she doesn't want me.
<Jim> I'm not going to tell you how to live your life, you'd better find out on your own
<TOY_PON3> My ex gf broke up with me around December
<TOY_PON3> last year
<TOY_PON3> No, take that back she cheated on me and I broke up with her.
<OneTrickPony> you should probably move on it will be better that way
<KwakLad> She broke up with you? then you have no controll over it do you?
<KwakLad> oh right
<TOY_PON3> It's just we were together for 2 years..
<TOY_PON3> That's the most I've ever been with someone
<OneTrickPony> if you get back with she will probably cheat on you again
<TOY_PON3> True..
<OneTrickPony> you will find someone better don't worry
<TOY_PON3> I want to find a pegasister or atleast some girl that can tolerate with me being a brony
<Jim> She couldn't?
<TOY_PON3> She did. She watched it but wasn't really a fan.
<Phase4> why cant you just be friends?
*Phase4 is not good with relationships
<OneTrickPony> friendzoned
<TOY_PON3> Because then knowing how stupid I am I would probably start falling for her again...
<TOY_PON3> Unless I start to remind myself of all the abuse she gave me during our relationship then maybe I could work things out with her.
<KwakLad> dont worry Phase4 im not either :p
<Phase4> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/smile.html + http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twqM56f_cVo
<TOY_PON3> Thank you Phase4
<KwakLad> TOY_PON3: perhaps tell your friends and have them also remind you if they notice you do start to fall for her again?
<TOY_PON3> I'm..I'm gonna try to be a friend. Maybe it would work, but if not. Then I will have her out of my life completely. I have to promise myself to NOT fall in love with her again.
<TOY_PON3> I can do that too
<Phase4> i've gota reboot then check somethign and go to bed, night #bronystate
<Phase4> TOY_PON3: good luck, wish i could be more help
<KwakLad> Good night Phase4
<TOY_PON3> night Phase4 thanks for helping me out

<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 10,02Mutterguy is the narrator :D
<Mutterguy> Game Master /moderater or whatever
<KwakLad> ohh i guess its a bit more general than DM for dungeon master
<PrincessDerpy> KwakLad: Yeah, DM is DnD specific GM.
<Mutterguy> DM is just specific D&D
<Mutterguy> dang it
<KwakLad> aye i did realise :p
<PrincessDerpy> I need more tea. brb
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 01,04Hurry up with the storry o____o

*SuperBrony64|Zzz pulls blankets up closer to face excited for the rest of the story
<PrincessDerpy> Thanks, and if ya'll pardon, I'm going back to me, using quotes for dialogue henceforth.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 10,02I lieked PrincessDerpy though ;__;
<KwakLad> "So, erm hi"
<xles> "Will you be staying here long?"
<KwakLad> "Planning on hanging around this area for a season or two if im welcome"
<Jim> Oh my the KwakLad character seems to be a fourth wall breaker
<xles> "Everyone's welcome in my kingdom! ...Unless they touch my muffins. Nobody touches my royal muffins!"
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 10,02derpy lieks muffins :3
<KwakLad> "so iI'll be needing a place to stay, perhaps rent out of the way a little bit"
<KwakLad> "Muffins you say? I'm a dab hand at making them, i could help sometimes perhaps"
<bartsonic> who doesnt like muffins
<xles> "You bake muffins?"
<KwakLad> "I do try often"
<xles> I don't particularly like'em actually, hah.
<xles> "Well, sounds to me like you could use some expert hooves to help you out, for a taste test"
<bartsonic> xles: shun
<KwakLad> "pity about that is i dont have any with me right now, i've been on a long trek and ate them all"
<xles> bartsonic: Feel free to take over if you want. I'm rubbish at this. And I'm a muffin'-hatin' herritic! =P

<Mutterguy> I;m honestly having writeers block for a single word
<KwakLad> xles oh shus im terrible too but you can see im trying
<xles> "Shoot. I guess that's just as well, I was on my way to my good friend Pinkie Pie to get some anyway"
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 10,02*squee*
<bartsonic> GOING TO PINKIE PIES yay
<xles> Someone seriously needs to make a MLP:FiM RPG... As in actual pen&paper RPG.
<KwakLad> "Pinkie pie? Odd name i'd think she'd be better with pies than muffins"
<KwakLad> xles i know ive had this idea
<Mutterguy> Just then the fanfare (ddddduuuuuh) sounded! "Presssseeentttting the Element Of Laughter!"
<xles> "She's pretty awesome at all things tasty, especially cupcakes"
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 10,02If you check last Monday's newsletter, a group we are working with is making a MLP RPG :D
<xles> SuperBrony64|Zzz: Squee!
<Jim> That is relevant to my interests

<ofna01> lol
<Mutterguy> (I can't retcon! that would be dishonourable!)
<ofna01> Derpy and the Quest For the MAgic Muffin
<xles> Mutterguy: General outline is; princess derpy, going to pinkie, being stolen by our villain KwakLad, so SuperBrony64|Zzz can rescue her.
<ofna01> that would be awesome
<MASF123> I'm beyond confused here. @_@ Sounds like Pole Playing to me...
<MASF123> Role
<xles> MASF123: It is, because I couldn't be arsed to come up with dialogue. ;)
<Jim> ohai ofna01
<ofna01> ohai jim
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 10,02I guess it is technically roleplaying...
<Mutterguy> collabrative strory telling...
<KwakLad> "ohh i see a nice house at the edge of town, even better its for rent, i can use that while i stay"
<ofna01> nope,chuck testa
<KwakLad> "ill have to talk to the agent about that"
<valoreins> dammit, why is the new episode got delayed!?
<MASF123> I would join in, but I suck at writing stories. :(
<xles> "You do that!"

<ofna01> oh ponies is back
<xles> I've only read two fanfics myself... Cupcakes and rocket to insanity. =P
<xles> Both of which are topics not for discussion.
<xles> I however intend to violate that rule and state the following; The most disturbing thing is that they're so poorly executed.
<xles> ...The storytelling that is.
<valoreins> :O
<ofna01> a pinkie pie song!
<ofna01> : D
<Jim> Heard that they are poorly written
<xles> ofna01: AMAZING pinkiesong.

<xles> Ditzy and dinky doo. (Pre fandom influence)
<ofna01> ok
<ofna01> now i get it
<xles> I'm in the minority that still prefer Ditzy over Derpy. =P
<Jim> This is Dinky I guess http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120123081729/mlp/images/3/39/Written_Script_and_Golden_Harvest_with_filly_Dinky_Doo_S2E14.png

*Jim refreshes mail

<Hazard> good news!
<ofna01> that was horrible
<valoreins> scene*
<EspyLacopa> CCCP: We watched that months ago
<Hazard> im not going to schoool today!
<Jim> List of movies we've watched: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmUkrR9vDjRUdFl0Z0pReE9TS3VPRkZXeFI4VW9POGc&hl=en_US#gid=0
<EspyLacopa> Sooo many months ago
<xles> I know the perfect combination; The day the earth stood still (1951) for A, and Forbidden Planet for B.
<CCCP> EspyLacopa: :( y am i always so late?
<EspyLacopa> It was the first movie night I was here for. Young Frankenstein and Super Mario Brothers.
<CCCP> u guys watched The Room? lololololol
<ofna01> time to take out the adorable trash
<Hazard> XD
<EspyLacopa> Ahhh, Spider's Web.
<EspyLacopa> Someone should add a note that it got hit by the Horrible Movie Clause.
<Hazard> Spiders Web is a good movie
<CCCP> what about The Princess Bride?
<EspyLacopa> Heh. Meowception.
<ofna01> situation that would suck* stuck in an elevator but having to use the bathroom
<Hazard> >.>
<Hazard> that WOULD suck but you DO just pry the door open and piss/shit out of it down into the elevator shaft
<Jim> ^
<xles> ofna01: Not a problem judging by the smell in elevators around the stockholm metro area.
<CCCP> we should watch Evil Dead 2
<EspyLacopa> Deathstalker II was awesome.
<Tovler> :( I never watched Firefly and Space Mutiny is useless without The Bots
<Jim> You've got time to watch Firefly before Friday Tovler, it's only one season.
<Hazard> time is the future
<Hazard> and the future is time
<Jim> And it's a very good show
<Jim> And life is time
<Jim> Therefore, life is life
<Hazard> XD
*Jim nananananana
<Hazard> ^
<Hazard> did i ever mention this is probably the best chatting/streaming site i have EVER been to? because it is
<MirrorImage> Hazard - that's because ponies.
<EspyLacopa> The Up/Deathstalker II night was wonderful.
<Hazard> not because ponys
<Jim> Because bronies and ponies
<Hazard> because bronies :D
*xles hugs everypony.
*Jim hugs xles
<EspyLacopa> Because magic is friendship, Hazard.
<MirrorImage> and because ponies, bronies
<MirrorImage> my statement is no less valid
<Hazard> true
<EspyLacopa> I do remember being in the channel and listening during the initial Inception stream.
<EspyLacopa> And thus hearing the Meow.
*Hazard silently waits patiently for the stream to come on but is being careful to NOT take his pants off while doing so
<CCCP> We could always watch Plan 9 from outerspace
<Hazard> why not Killer Klowns From Outer Space?
<Jim> Watching the stream without pants is best way to watch stream
<EspyLacopa> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-so-dont-make-her-dissapoint.png <-- Hazard
<nido> Hazard: because of tomatoes
*Jim notices he's in public "Oh bugger"
<Hazard> EspyLacopa: thats why I DONT do it
<CCCP> Y U WATCH ALL MOVIES I WANT TO SEE ALREADY???
<xles> If it wasn't because people unfamiliar with the film would take offence, I would suggest the danish 90s film "Gayniggers from outer space", because it's hillarious.
<Hazard> Dead Space Downfall for B movie anypony?
<Jim> Wow, dat title xles o_O
<EspyLacopa> B Movie: Howard the Duck
<Tovler> That movie is only 30 minutes long
<Hazard> :P
<Hazard> its not a movie then Tov
<xles> Jim: Hehehe, yeah I know. People who don't know the film go "HUBUBUBUB! THAT'S OFFENCIVE!" =)
<CCCP> this is an actual title for a movie we should watch: Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D
<Hazard> I bet the GayNigger's leader comes out onto a stage and sings "Come on everybody,Everybody clap yo hands!"
<Jim> While we're at weird titles: "The Man with the Smallest Penis in Existence and the Electron Microscope Technician Who Loved Him"
<xles> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274518/
<xles> There you have it.
<EspyLacopa> My ongoing pick for B Movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083258/
<Tovler> The Strange Thing About the Johnsons is far more offensive and is also 30 minutes long.
<CCCP> Jim: LOLWUT?
<Jim> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374020/
<xles> It's only 26 minutes, but it's so much fun.
<Hazard> that sounds insane Jim
<CCCP> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105643/
<Jim> it's a 9 minute movie though it seems
<Jim> haven't seen it myself
<Hazard> XD
<Hazard> wow cccp
<Hazard> brb
<xles> Jim: We can have a "offensive sounding short films"-night ;)
<Jim> This one is actually supposed to be good, I'm gonna suggest it as B-movie
<Jim> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740707/
<EspyLacopa> Your troll movie is no Labyrinth
<EspyLacopa> It doesn't even have David Bowie sempai-san-sama
<Tovler> The B movie I keep picking… will never get picked, so why bother even sharing it? ;_;
<Tovler> -dono
<EspyLacopa> KUN!
<Jim> Which one do you keep suggesting Tovler ?
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViftZTfRSt8
<CCCP> The Thing
<EspyLacopa> Do you have the power?
<xles> Jim: I suggest you watch gayniggers from outer space sometime if you feel for something very silly. Basically the Gayniggers from outer space travel the galaxy to rid it of womenfolk.
<CCCP> Jim: i saw that movie
<Jim> Sounds fun xles
<Jim> CCCP: Was it any good? I haven't seen it myself yet
<xles> I need to watch it again, probably been 15 years since I saw it.
<EspyLacopa> Good lord, watching Labyrinth in this channel was awesome.
<CCCP> no
<CCCP> Jim: it was okay until u see the trolls
<Jim> Low budget animation I suppose
<CCCP> they look like they are from an N64 movie
<CCCP> game*
<xles> We could always watch Videodrome.
<CCCP> we could watch the original Texas Chainsaw massacre
<Jim> I don't really like those kinds of splatter movies
<CCCP> or Silence of the Lambs
<xles> Hey, the whole Gayniggers from outer space short film is uploaded to youtube, wonderful! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ncwCETyQlk
<CCCP> Jim: the original is alot less of a splatter movie than most think
<CCCP> is chat frozen?
<Jim> Nope, it's dead, Jim!
<fluttertay> i can see yours
<xles> No, people are just preoccupied with other stuff, I'm watching danish cinema at it's best.
<Hazard> ohai guys
<Jim> ohai Hazard
<fluttertay> the video isnt playing for me :(
<CCCP> u guys already watched Evil Dead 2 :(
<Jim> don't think there's a stream at the moment fluttertay
<fluttertay> ohhh
<Hazard> my grandma came in here i thought she would kill me :P but apparently not
<fluttertay> makes sense
<Tovler> I'm too busy watching Samurai cutting helicopters in half.
<Hazard> oh god i miss my old PC *sobs*
<Jim> Kill you for what? Were you grabbing cookies again?
<Hazard> yes and i was on her computer
<Hazard> did i kill the chat in cold blood just now?
<xles> No, I'm busy watching Gayniggers from Outer Space.
<Tovler> I already explained myself
<nido> I don't like that movie
<CCCP> xles: u like saying that name alot
<Jim> Why not? Gayniggers from Outer Space is a neat name for a movie
<CCCP> ya its just.....well u know
<xles> CCCP: It's a solid short film from denmark, nothing to be ashamed of.
<Hazard> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLvIyme2MU4&list=FLTBn7pTsF7FAUDZNE6nkYpw&index=6&feature=plpp_video the video i have been watching for the last 40 minutes of no streaming
<Kammerjunk> ...
<Kammerjunk> It is?
<Kammerjunk> I am ashamed now.
<xles> Kammerjunk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ncwCETyQlk
<CCCP> Hazard: best weird song
<Hazard> my grandma and i watched the weirdest fucking music video the other day
<Kammerjunk> Oh Goddesses, that horrible Danish accent.
<Jim> http://imgur.com/xxAkY
<Hazard> it was QUEEN VICTORIA GROWING GIGANTIC AND EATING TWO GROWN PEOPLE!
<String_Shredder> i was listening to Revolution 9 0.o
<xles> "Holy phallus, what are they doing down there?!"
<Kammerjunk> I hate it. It was so embarrassing seeing Lars Løkke sitting next to Obama.
<CCCP> that boy needs therapy
<Hazard> Yes some birds are funny when they talk.
<CCCP> and he also lay false teeth
<CCCP> what does that mean?
<xles> Man this short film is super silly.
<CCCP> your a nut
<CCCP> not u xles
<Hazard> super silly xles? thats just what a silly filly would say XD
<xles> Hazard: I admit, I'm a silly filly, and so is the creator of this short. ;)

<CCCP> xles: but they refuse to even look at it

<xles> Jim: Whatever happened to pegasister?
<Marshallow> I haven't met anyother althougt someone drew princces celestia on a folder and pinkie pie on a box. I am still searching for them.
<otakon> bartsonic: yh, it's genderless at this point, just refers to a older fan of the show
<bartsonic> ok then 1 or 2 brony friends
<Marshallow> Actyally, the females are called pegsusisters
<Jim> Some people prefer to use pegasister, but I know girls who refer to themselves as bronies
<Tovler> Smile Smile Smiler Smiler Cider Cider Cider Cider… darn it.

<bartsonic> http://nyanit.com/bronystate.net
<otakon> sorry, and all the expansions are 10 bucks a piece
<CCCP> are there and MLP mods for fallout 3?
<otakon> CCCP: you could just bite the bullet and buy a physical copy of it at walmart for 20 bucks on PC
<Cypresswolf> Heard IZ on the radio quite a bit vacationing with family in Maui a couple years ago
<CCCP> i could try that i guess
<Jim> bartsonic: We need to go deeper: http://nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/bronystate.net
*RainBowJack watches MLP season 2 episode 18 a Friend in deed
<Marshallow> I was said, "I was shuffling before it was cool with my pokemon cards."
<CCCP> Jim: HEHEHHEHE!
<xles> RainBowJack: Have fun!
<RainBowJack> i am xles

<RainBowJack> Pinkie pie epis are so hyper
<otakon> um wat?
<CCCP> brb
<Cypresswolf> See what I mean about the pmv version? the editing is a bit harsh, too obvious. If the artist redid this video with the song's entirety, it would be great
<Kammerjunk> bartsonic: That is my fetish.
<bartsonic> lol
<Marshallow> I found this and felt bad for laughing
<Marshallow> http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Nyan+11+Prolly+a+repost+but+I+ve+never+seen+it_8c3d7b_2485383.jpg
<Bronyzilla> :3
<Jim> funnyjunk pictures don't work
<Kammerjunk> They do to me.
<Jim> I can't see it though
<Marshallow> Want me to find another copy?
<Jim> redirects me to their main page
<bartsonic> ^
<xles> Marshallow: hahaha
<Marshallow> http://files.shroomery.org/files/11-26/960072697-nyan11.jpg
<Marshallow> there you go Jim
<Jim> It didn't work either o_O
<RainBowJack> i never been a pinkie pie fan but the episode made me like her a bit more
<xles> Likewise.
<Kammerjunk> >never been a pinkie pie fan
<bartsonic> true true
<Kammerjunk> How.
<Kammerjunk> I mean, Twilight is my favourite pony, but how.
<RainBowJack> RD is my favorite
<Tovler> Fluttershy needs to pick up the pace.
<bartsonic> yeah twilights my favorite
<Kammerjunk> Fluttershy used to be my favourite.
<Marshallow> Thats weird Jim. Such search "Nyan 11" and you'll see it JIm.
<Kammerjunk> But then Lesson Zero happened.
<xles> In my case it's probably earth pony racism. Because when I constructed my top 10 list, all pegasi in top, followed by unicorn. So I'm obviously biased.
<Marshallow> I thought donkeys and cows were in the bottom.
<Jim> I can tell what it is from just the title ^^
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9F-wM0gqQs
<bartsonic> lol
<RainBowJack> Sphyco Twilight was epic
<Kammerjunk> Being a fan of Napoleon XIV made me like Lesson Zero even more.
<Kammerjunk> Not the French guy.
<Kammerjunk> The guy who made D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\fallout 3 goty\Data
<Kammerjunk> I am so bad at this.
<xles> They're coming to take me away haha!
<Kammerjunk> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnzHtm1jhL4
<Kammerjunk> Exactly.
<xles> And a bunch of other tunes.
<Marshallow> I loved Crazy Twilight :D
<Marshallow> :)
<xles> I owe a lot, to iowa pot *sings*
<bartsonic> fits perfect with crazy twilight

<Jim> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DybCjKqyjLE&
<Jim> Don't you mean love and tolerate, bartsonic ?
<Kammerjunk> More fitting would be "I wrote you a little text to explain how much I love ponies."
<Kammerjunk> Also, that book's probably the size of half of mine.
<bartsonic> oh well i did not see that pic on memebase time to make it my own pic and profit
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG90sNcVMqk
<bartsonic> ^ south park refference
<Tovler> aww, I shaved my head again.
<otakon> I have returned for a moment
<xles> Huzzah!
<Marshallow> Guys, I read this and its mindblowing. Remember when Rainbow Dash tried to prank Fluttershy with a fake turtle. Now remember how Fluttershy trolled Rainbow Dash by giving him a pet turtle.
<Marshallow> -giving her -
<Kammerjunk> Mother of Luna.
<xles> "oops"
<Kammerjunk> Fluttershy is now a troll.
<bartsonic> turtle works hard to be her pet never appears in any more episodes
<CountDoofus> tortoise.
<xles> hahaha
<RainBowJack> what ever
<Jim> Hopefully we'll see more of Tank
<Marshallow> She trolled the king of trolls too, Discord.
<Cypresswolf> Was that a Pig Pen pony? :) Hooray! Peanuts Ponies!
<CountDoofus> hi everypony btw
<Jim> ohai CountDoofus
<xles> CountDoofus: Hi, haha, awesome.
<Kammerjunk> Jim: With all the continuity in the latest episode, I'd be surprised if we didn't.
<bartsonic> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyIy_5Fl_pY&feature=endscreen&NR=1
<Kammerjunk> That's not the TARDIS!
<Cypresswolf> Good Morning Count

<CountDoofus> yeh, we didn't see Tank after he came into pay, but the Cake twins? Eeeyup
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kri83dexbyw *Squee* ^_^
<xles> Pony fandom needs less talented people in it... I can't bloody keep up with all the amazing art being produced.
<RainBowJack> i love the babies cake
<Kammerjunk> Marshallow: >Great Scoot
<Kammerjunk> I see what he did there.
<RainBowJack> LOL Cypresswolf
<Marshallow> Princess Trollestia replies to Twilght's letter by saying, "too long didn't read."
<RainBowJack> derpy is every where in every pony epi almost
<bartsonic> omg i agree fanfiction does scare the shit out of me
<Kammerjunk> bartsonic: Then stop reading grimdark.
<RainBowJack> Princess Molestia sends Twilight a letter sehe replies "I want to see your sexy plot "
<Kammerjunk> It's your own fault.
<otakon> well not ALL of it is bad
<CountDoofus> there's some funny fics out there
<Kipkat07> hi everypony
<otakon> just the more "infamous" ones are recognized is all
<CountDoofus> hiya Kipkat07

<Kammerjunk> I'm currently reading ANOTHER 63+ fic. It's incomplete, too.
<Kammerjunk> Not all fics are bad.
<bartsonic> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wowVI6DB_eg&feature=player_embedded
<Tovler> http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/5/50/647Keldeo.png r34 ponies have ruined pokemon for me.
<CountDoofus> can't stop staring at that... plot
<Cypresswolf> ...class is still down...alright...Well, Im gonna play some Fable 3
<Kammerjunk> bartsonic: I have to agree with people, that is a quite good first PMV.
<bartsonic> darn it another pony walked into the sun
<Marshallow> Recommend me some good fanics to read.
<Kammerjunk> Also, even with music blasting, I can STILL somehow hear Fluttershy saying "yay~".
<bartsonic> lol
<RainBowJack> Bye bye everypony
<CountDoofus> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/9329/Beating-the-Heat
<Jim> bye RainBowJack
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, RainBowJack.
<CountDoofus> g'day RainBowJack
<Kipkat07> i usually dont read fanfics. I read clopfics. jk

<Kammerjunk> nope.avi
<otakon> Marshallow: um that's kind of subjective but my favorite is Fallout: Equestria
<Kipkat07> how is that one
<CountDoofus> okay, there's some sexual stuff in there, but it's also the most hilarious fic I've ever read
<CountDoofus> but, can't make you read it, can I
<Marshallow> yay
<Kipkat07> i never played fallout but i heared about fallout: equestria a whole lot
<Kammerjunk> Marshallow: "How Did I Get Here?" on 64 chapters and the sequel "Le Retour" currently going at 25 chapters. Also, "Through the Eyes of Another Pony". These are all Human in Equestria, I'll see if I can't dig anything else up.
<otakon> Kipkat07: it's Fallout but with ponies
<Kipkat07> o
<Kammerjunk> But it depends, really. What genre do you like?
<bartsonic> ... my little dashie
<otakon> Kipkat07: there is humour, violence, even a little love but it's really good tbh
<Kipkat07> do they have the mane 6?
<Kammerjunk> I tried reading Fallout: Equestria.
<Kammerjunk> But that kind of grimdark is not for me, at least not mixed with ponies.
<Marshallow> I don't want anything sad. Doctor Whoove: The Voice of the Elder was sad. :'(
<otakon> Kipkat07: in a sense....it happens about 200 years after the end of the world basically
<Kipkat07> mld was too sad for me
<Kipkat07> oooo ok
<otakon> Kipkat07: might be too dark for you then
<Kipkat07> m'kay
<Marshallow> What about "My Little Pony: Friendship is Tragic"
<Marshallow> I heard of that one.
<bartsonic> that sounds nice
<bartsonic> trollface
<Marshallow> damn you Trollestia
<Kipkat07> holy god, 47 chapters!!!???
<xles> http://zirbronium.deviantart.com/art/Twilight-Sparkle-Discovers-Twitter-285629091
<Kammerjunk> Well, there's "The Showmare's Tale" if you like Trixie telling stories. Luna and Vinyl teams up in "Party. Sleep. Repeat."
<otakon> Kipkat07: 49 including the epilogue and afterword, 600K+ words, 2K pages on standard paper with standard font.
<Kipkat07> o
<Kammerjunk> I have a bunch of shipping, but not everypony likes romance.
<otakon> eh
<Kipkat07> i does
<bartsonic> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u2JBwlDfMg&feature=endscreen&NR=1
<otakon> I've read one semi shipping fanfic
<Marshallow> Something I amm not gonna read is Cupcakes.
<Kammerjunk> I really should get around to downloading these fics to my local library.
<ekips> heya all
<otakon> Marshallow: do not mention that here please
<otakon> hiya ekips
<bartsonic> i listened to cupcakes but not read it
<Marshallow> Sorry.
<otakon> /)_-)
<bartsonic> opps
<Jim> ohai ekips
<Kammerjunk> And those were all complete. I have around 30 fics or so I'm waiting to update.
<Marshallow> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm6f8q-r9HM
<Globetrotter> Ayup everypony!
<Jim> ohai Globetrotter
<CountDoofus> g'day Globetrotter
<Globetrotter> How's everypony doing? Jolly good I hope.
<Kammerjunk> And then around 25 more I haven't gotten around to reading.
<ekips> heya Globetrotter
<Kammerjunk> 82 local fics I haven't read.
<Kammerjunk> Wow, I'll have a busy week.
<Kammerjunk> Oh wait, no. Even more.
<CountDoofus> anyone got some sad fics? I've read My Little Dashie, but it didn't do anything for me
<bartsonic> well then no
<Marshallow> Doctor Whooves and the Voice of the Elder.
<Globetrotter> I'm getting a bowler hat.
<Kammerjunk> Stronger than My Little Dashie? I could print out a picture of the Mane 6 crying and shove it in your face for 3 hours if that'll help.
<Marshallow> its pretty said
<bartsonic> well none that i can mention
<Tovler> I couldn't find a boater hat
<CountDoofus> does that require knowledge of the actual Dr. Who show?
<Marshallow> no
<CountDoofus> off I go!
<Marshallow> Its just sad, what happens
<Globetrotter> Anyone here know how to do clothes?
<otakon> CountDoofus: hmm, you could try Sunset
<Kammerjunk> Oh. No. I have 83 -categories- on my disk I haven't gotten around to read.
<Kammerjunk> I sure will have a busy week.
<CountDoofus> I'll check it out, thanks ;)
<Marshallow> Countdoofus here
<Marshallow> http://shwiggityshwah.deviantart.com/art/Doctor-Whooves-Elder-Page-1-265417529
<bartsonic> just saw of dr whooves now i get it
<bartsonic> a picture of
<Fazana> Hey everypony
<Globetrotter> Fazana Ayup me duck
<Marshallow> Reading Doctor Whooves made me dislike the actual series.
<Jim> ohai Fazana
<CountDoofus> hi Fazana
<Fazana> I'm back after my crazy racing experience
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBg6qC3ZvvQ <-- Moments in Sailor Moon's life. . .
<Jim> Do tell us more
<Fazana> It didn't turn out so well
<Fazana> I managed to pick up an injury
<Globetrotter> Apparently x/0 = infinity
<Kammerjunk> I was reading that Doctor Whooves comic until I saw the bowtie around his neck.
<Globetrotter> WoOoOo
<Kammerjunk> I'll just go back to my book now.
<Fazana> Drove into someone in a corner and flipped. Sprained my wrist from the car hitting the barrier at about 40mph
<Marshallow> Time what you think of the series kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Marshallow: Which of them? I prefer series 2 through 4 of the new show.
<Kammerjunk> I have to agree with dari on Matt Smith.
<Fazana> I like Matt Smith, his script is just terribad
<bartsonic> mlp is so popular now it needs some games or a movie
<Kammerjunk> bartsonic: Games are being made.
<Marshallow> I dislike matt smith he is kind of coward always running
<Kammerjunk> What's that MMO called again?
<bartsonic> hopefully an mmorpg
<Kammerjunk> Marshallow: No, that's just the Doctor. There's a lot of running involved.
<Fazana> Marshallow: He is only equipped with a scroggy that has alientech, and he avoids killing people
<Marshallow> I know that but i really dislike when he doesn't save everyone.
<Globetrotter> Anyone know how to wear a bowler hat?
<Globetrotter> Rally to me brits!
<Kammerjunk> Well, there's a reason the 9th Doctor said "Just this once, Rose, everybody lives!"
<Fazana> Globetrotter, but it on flatly, with the front facing your direction
*Kammerjunk doesn't own a bowler hat.
<Fazana> The same way you put on a fedora basically
<Kammerjunk> feelsbadman.jpg
<KwakLad2> On your headGlobetrotter
<Globetrotter> Fazana you are amazing
<Globetrotter> KwakLad2 You are my god
*Fazana is wearing his fedora
*KwakLad2 hugs worshippers
*Kammerjunk doesn't own a fedora either.
<Marshallow> I just really dislike how the doctor says the Darlek all died in the time war but they keep appearing but no time lords.
<bartsonic> http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/PopCulture/MyLittlePony.jsp looks like i need to go to hot tpoic
<Marshallow> Darleks Y U KEEP APPEARING?
<Fazana> Darleks can be made, doctors can't
<Globetrotter> Kammerjunk, we must buy you a hat.
<EspyLacopa> What's a Darlek?
<Kammerjunk> Marshallow: [HERE THERE BE SPOILERS] In the Time War, the two civilisations virtually wiped each other out. The Doctor survived as the only Time Lord [Citation needed], and some Daleks also survived.
<otakon> Fazana: sure Doctors can be made, you just need two Gallifreyans that love each other VERY VERY MUCH
<Marshallow> Its just really annoy because the show has a ton of loopholes.
<Fazana> River's birth was a mutation, and donna was because she fused herself with doc's DNA in his severed hand
<EspyLacopa> otakon, that makes time lords, not Doctors.
<Kammerjunk> Globetrotter: I used to have a hat.
<Kammerjunk> But then I brokested it.
<otakon> Marshallow: it's soft science fiction, it's might to be enjoyable not sense
<Fazana> otakon: they are just about exinct
<Globetrotter> Then we must buy you a new hat!
*Globetrotter gives Kammerjunk a hat
<Globetrotter> It's invisible
<bartsonic> ... i need a hat
<Globetrotter> and has no mass
<CountDoofus> I'm coming to the USA in a few months... first stop: Hot Topic! :)
<Jim> Loopholes are explained by wibbly wobbly timey wimey
<Fazana> I have a ton of british hats, which do you want?
<Marshallow> I dislike Amy. I liked Rose more than her. Amy is always whinning and yelling "DOCTOR!"
<Globetrotter> What do you wear with a bowler Fazana?
<Kammerjunk> I liked Rose, Rose was cool.
<otakon> EspyLacopa: yh, but The Doctor is a Timelord and I DOUBT he is a singular occurence in ALL of existence is all I'm saying.
<Fazana> Often a monacle, people tend to look good with a bowler, monacle and a pipe if you smoke.
<otakon> I would like a Gentlemans Tophat!
<bartsonic> me too
<KwakLad2> Fazana I'm afraid to say you missed the word 'stuff'
<Globetrotter> Fazana, casual bowler hat wearing though.
<Jim> http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/050/c/b/exquisite__by_brandeerawr-d4q8xza.jpg
<Kammerjunk> otakon: Oh, no. There used to be an entire planet of them. But they died. Then stuff happened, which resulted in other stuff because I don't want to spoil it.
<bartsonic> i need a top hat monacle suit pipe weed lol
<otakon> Kammerjunk: I know most of it, I just haven't seen the whole damn series to this point is all. Friggin prince-dari won't show anything past Tennant
<Kammerjunk> Asides from the "Are you my mummy?" episode, yeah.
<Fazana> I'd say you should get a mad hatters hat (I forget the proper name, they are like tophats, but are much taller) and have a pipe with it, even if you don't smoke it.
<Kammerjunk> Oh, past Tennant.
<Kammerjunk> That's because dari doesn't like Matt Smith.
<EspyLacopa> Don't forget Rassilon, with his silly outfit.
<Fazana> Kammerjunk: The empty child
<Kammerjunk> That's the one.
<Fazana> Mummy....mummy, are you my mummy? *scared me*
<EspyLacopa> Don't Blink.
<Jim> Mama? Mama Luigi?
<Kammerjunk> I don't watch a lot of the 9th Doctor, to be honest.
<Marshallow> http://lh4.ggpht.com/-ovWvxVcKg4k/TlO1g0DxpWI/AAAAAAAABLA/Jiwkm0OmiD0/by%252520janey-jane%25255B4%25255D.jpg
<Fazana> 9th doc is good
<Jim> dat Rose Marshallow
<The_4th_Wall> hello
<Jim> ohai The_4th_Wall
<Marshallow> I know
<Kammerjunk> When I got into Doctor Who, Tennant was already there. So I was a little confused when I saw the 9th Doctor.
<Fazana> Chris eccles is probably one of my most favourite doc
<EspyLacopa> Rassilon comes from a Doctor Who thing that aired back in '83.
<otakon> hiya one who is broken constantly by the small pastel colored equine know as Pinkie!
<bartsonic> there are to many doctor hooves http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/214/048/1.jpg

<Kammerjunk> Wait, did I start a Doctor Who discussion because I said that I didn't like Smith?
*Tovler goes to pony confessions and says he hates the 10 doctor.
<Jim> That's awesome RawketLawnchair
<otakon> RawketLawnchair: but that character she's dressed as is a GUY
<Kammerjunk> Tovler: That's okay. I still love you.

<RawketLawnchair> And otakon , Gwyndolin had powered relating to the moon, so I thought it was fitting.
<Jim> Marshallow: HAHA
<Kammerjunk> I swear, the incarnations of the Doctor keep getting younger and younger.
<otakon> Marshallow: you DO realize that him being over 900 years old that he can consider ALL of us children right?
<Fazana> otakon: Doctor heavy: ENTIRE EARTH, IS BABIES!
<Marshallow> D:
<otakon> RawketLawnchair: good point, but still a guy, who tries to kill you for going through a door

<otakon> RawketLawnchair: her bust is ALREADY friggin bigger than your damn body
<RawketLawnchair> As we've seen, Gwyn and his family were only slightly larger than the player
<otakon> RawketLawnchair: well I'd like to think she is anyway, maybe she is normal sized if you ever do meet her
<The_4th_Wall> n/me suffers a heart attack

<otakon> RawketLawnchair: did you SEE The Lord of Cinder? He's like and easy 10 feet tall and Gywndolin is another easy ten feet tall. Who's to say the daughter isn't just really BIG it wouldn't be that surprising in that family

<Tom> Episode 19 of season 2 "Putting Your Hoof Down" airs in 12 days, 1 hours, 21 minutes, 8 seconds (Mar 03 2012 18:00:00 GMT)
<otakon> yh
<otakon> new timeslot
*Jim puts on waiting hat "Oh boy"
<otakon> as in 1pm
<The_4th_Wall> later?
<CCCP> this season should never end
<otakon> as in 1pm EST
<otakon> which means if my net goes out again
<otakon> I'm screwed
<RawketLawnchair> IT's justgunna be a rehash of Dragonshy. Mark my words.
<RawketLawnchair> Ha ha!
<The_4th_Wall> wait... 3pm Mst?
<otakon> RawketLawnchair: YOU ARE WRONG!!!!!
<Tovler> I wonder if Fluttershy will sing the F.U.N. song?
<The_4th_Wall> Well at least i'll make the live ep on here
<The_4th_Wall> :)
<CCCP> Next ep needs more derpy
<The_4th_Wall> ^
<RawketLawnchair> The new Flooter episode will either be: Dragonshy rehash, the episode of Sponge Bob on the beach where he's a jerk while being assertive, like the Scrubs episode where Iron Will was dead the whole time, or Iron Will will bel ike Kamina.
<RawketLawnchair> In order of likelyhood.
<Tovler> Aggressively nice Fluttershy? no wait, that's Pinkie
<The_4th_Wall> The past 2 times i've stayed up for the live pony stream, I fell asleep before the new ep aired
<CCCP> Simpsons did it every thing has already been done before. Nothing is original
<The_4th_Wall> 3PM local time is a welcome change
<otakon> RawketLawnchair: I HAVE PROOF that's she's actually that big!
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&list=PL9705D23B7A55A495&v=PnTPsNAutKY
<Snakkkeeeeees> Sooooooo bored
<otakon> go play a game
<otakon> of disappearing bears
<Snakkkeeeeees> can't in college library :V
<otakon> crap
*The_4th_Wall makes plans to watch new ep at home where he doesn't have HUB
<CCCP> Snakkkeeeeees: scream out IM A BRONY!
<The_4th_Wall> yay VGA cables
<RawketLawnchair> otakon: Gwynevre left Anor Londo a long time ago, and there's no real depiction of how she lookedl ike, and Gwyndolin probably took liberties when making the illusion ofh er.
<otakon> RawketLawnchair: Priscilla her daughter
<RawketLawnchair> We know she is your waifu, so give it a rest already.
<otakon> no she's not
<The_4th_Wall> pony vid on 42" tv, chat on laptop
<RawketLawnchair> Ha ha!
<Snakkkeeeeees> I'll pass. I havn't even seen signs of other bronies around so if there's any hidden they're like me and don't want everyone to know
<The_4th_Wall> I want EVERYONE to know
<RawketLawnchair> Snakkkeeeeees: Hide your powerlevel at all costs.
<CCCP> Snakkkeeeeees: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&list=PL9705D23B7A55A495&v=qqo53-pNxsE
<Snakkkeeeeees> lol well my friends know but that's about it
<IshNotMorningPony> hai everpony
<The_4th_Wall> I AM NOT ASHAMED
<Snakkkeeeeees> lol well I'm shy so don't judge... you know... if you don't want to.
<otakon> RawketLawnchair: it makes sense though, Priscilla is a halfbreed dragon with NO scales that towers over the PC, Seath has GOT to be her father and Gywnevre would have to be the mother, considering the Painted World is in HER cathedral and all. It makes perfect sensce. Which also means she either had relations with Seath, or was raped....yikes.
<The_4th_Wall> I've taken my Celly/Twi blanket into public on my way to school before
<The_4th_Wall> that's on public transit
<CCCP> Im shy but i told everpony at my school im a brony and it makes every thing so great
<The_4th_Wall> HIDE NOTHING
<Snakkkeeeeees> lol well /forever alone
<RawketLawnchair> Hide everything.
<RawketLawnchair> http://i43.tinypic.com/9uyxl1.jpg Hide everything.
<CCCP> GET A MLP SHIRT
<IshNotMorningPony> ohai #bronystate
<RawketLawnchair> Nothing is safe. Got to follow the rules.
<Snakkkeeeeees> yeah I plan on getting a shirt soon enough and I do plan on wearing it but I doubt anyone here would even get it
<CCCP> RawketLawnchair: i used to be like that
<otakon> i'm not like that
<The_4th_Wall> Bronies should have nothing to fear. we watch the "girliest" show there is and think it's the best thing ever.
<Snakkkeeeeees> I'm going to put of flyers around campus of the mane 6
<otakon> enver have been

*Lucid cowers in fright
<Lucid> Oh, never mind
<Bronyzilla> \;3
<EspyLacopa> Hilarious idea for a thanksgiving dinner: serve it as though you mummified the turkey: Cover the turkey with edible mummy wrappings, and serve the stuffing and cranberry sauce in canopic jars
<Bronyzilla> Lol.
<Bronyzilla> That's a quality idea.
<Jim> As long as the Turkey isn't 3000 years old
<KwakLad> that would be awesome
<EspyLacopa> It even comes with a Mummy's Curse: You are doomed to fall into a delicious turkey-fueled coma.
<KwakLad> Are you going to invite indian stallone?
<Bronyzilla> :P
<Lucid> So I take it not everyone here is ame4rican, given that you're not at work

<KwakLad> English
<Bronyzilla> British
<CountDoofus> Belgian
<KwakLad> And so he should be Jim
<Lucid> Brit brohoof!
<EspyLacopa> Maybe the fake mummy wrappings could be the biscuits, specially shaped to mimic the wrapping..
<Lucid> where abouts?
<RawketLawnchair> Please. I am Belgian.
<CountDoofus> wanna share a waffle?
<RawketLawnchair> Ha ha, I would, but I am not actually Belgian.

<Bronyzilla> Lol, I had an all nighter last night; I loved it! Almost fell asleep in a serious Mock Exam, but still. :3
<EspyLacopa> Belgian. . .I was taught by my faithful hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy how dirty a word that is. You should be ashamed of yourself for saying it here.

<Kipkat07> hi everypony!
<Jim> hi Kipkat07
<Kipkat07> hi jim
<Jim> Suddenly connection issues
<Kipkat07> is this TF2?
<Jim> yep
<alexxm> hi Kipkat07
<Kipkat07> hi alex
<Tarku> Wrek: \team fortress 2\tf\materials\vgui\logos
<CountDoofus> this song is surprisingly relaxing, even though I don't understand a word of it
<alexxm> seem's very solmen to go with this game
<RAWRity> hola
<CountDoofus> heya RAWRity
<alexxm> hey RAWRity
<xles> What's going on in here then everypony?
<alexxm> what u been up to today
<Jim> TF2
<Kipkat07> im gonna play TF2 anypony wanna join?
<Wrek> 05join us instead
<Kipkat07> how
<xles> I want to watch a film, but can't decide what to watch.
<Jim|TF2> 19:25:33] <@Wrek> type connect 46.236.85.221 in console
<CountDoofus> eating dinner now, and got a response from my betareader regarding my fanfic, got a lot of improvements to make :p
<Kipkat07> What console
<Wrek> 05this is a nice song imo
<alexxm> whats your fanfic about CountDoofus
<CountDoofus> Guardians of Ga'Hoole
<alexxm> is that the owl film that came out a couple of years ago
<RAWRity> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/internet-memes-whoops.gif
<Kipkat07> bai gonna join the game
<CountDoofus> yeah, but it's based on the book series, and my fic is mostly based on those
<CountDoofus> RAWRity: lol :D
<alexxm> oh i didn't know they were based on a book
<CountDoofus> first 3 out of 15, to be exact
<alexxm> well scar's won then RAWRity
<RAWRity> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-slowcord.jpg
<alexxm> any word on a 3rd season
<CountDoofus> in production
<alexxm> good
<CountDoofus> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic_episodes
<RAWRity> There has been a 3rd season confirmed but anything else about it is just speculation.
<alexxm> ok cool
<CountDoofus> somehow I really hope the CMC will get their cutie marks, either in the S2 finale or the S3 opener
<alexxm> when is the newsletter sent out anyway
<alexxm> i hope discord comes back
<CountDoofus> seems unlikely, but who knows
<RAWRity> doubt it'll happen in the S2 finale. All signs are pointing towards the Finale focusing on Princess Cadence and Shining Armor
<CountDoofus> aka two characters we've never seen before
<CountDoofus> (right?)
<RAWRity> eeyup. But Hasbro needed new toys to sell
<Kammerjunk> Tea takes too long to make.
<alexxm> if discord did come back i thought it would be intresting to have the mane 6 need his help to deal with a villian based around order but have him still be the magnifcant bastad we know him as
<Kipkat07> Where is the console that i can put the code in Wrek?
<RAWRity> I just got around to listening to that Dr. Whooves Radio drama. Pretty neat. Some of the Voice acting needs work, but well done for a first outing.
<Jim|TF2> go to the bronystate steam group and find Wrek's username and click join server
<Kipkat07> oo ok
<LordCelestia> 0,5http://docwario.deviantart.com/art/Derpy-Hooves-in-the-Land-of-Muffins-284404469
<alexxm> what did u guys think of my idea
<Jim|TF2> Awesome LC
<CountDoofus> Derpy gets all my awwwwww
<Wrek> 05sounds neat alexxm, but old disco would probably hold one hell ofa grudge
<alexxm> yea i guessed i thought it would be he turns on them as soon as the order based villian is defeated
<Kipkat07> bye gon play tf2
<alexxm> cya Kipkat07
<CountDoofus> gonna join that server too
<alexxm> cya CountDoofus

<alexxm> what did u guys think of saturdays episode

<alexxm> the bit with the felt i guess
<Fazana> Brb, my microwave senses are tingling
<ScootaChicken> hey everypony :)
<Jim|TF2> ohai ScootaChicken

<Wrek> 05ye
<Tovler> Lola Bunny taught me everything I need to know about Presidents Day
<alexxm> besides i live in england
<Boltasar> there is vacation in the netherlands, that is what i know, becuase of carnival.
<alexxm> what is it Boltasar
<Kammerjunk> I don't celebrate holidays, but I'll take the vacation anyway.
<Boltasar> I dont really know myself, only had 4 years of carnival celebration, and I could care less, it is mostly about costumes I guess. Umm, lets see... I really dont know
<alexxm> how did you manage that jump
<Fazana> Back
<Boltasar> I do live in the Netherlands, but never in the part wherre carnival was really celebrated
<alexxm> ok thanks for the info
<Fazana> Soldier rampage
<alexxm> u know i have the werdiest schedule for tormorow
<Fazana> Exist?
<alexxm> go into college for 9
<alexxm> 4 hour gap between lessons
<Fazana> Confound you and your strange items! I havent had a single one in my 4 years of playing
<alexxm> then last lesson of the day
<Jim|TF2> Server shut down
<Kammerjunk> So it wasn't just me.
<Kammerjunk> Ah, no.
<CountDoofus> and coming up again
<Kammerjunk> Just connect again.
<Fazana> This song is ace.
<alexxm> queen is best band
<Jim|TF2> ^
<Hellsliver> what are we watching?
<Jim|TF2> TF2
<Fazana> An image of TF2 upon one's computerscreen
<Hellsliver> I once used to be good at it
<Fazana> But did an arrow end that?
<alexxm> serriously i have a 4 hour gap between lessons tormorow
<Hellsliver> I kinda got bored
<Fazana> '3'
<Hellsliver> all the good custom maps got forgotton when the easy pick were made
<Fazana> Balloon battle is epic
<alexxm> demoman is best samurai pirate
<Fazana> One of the best customs
<Hellsliver> I got an auto healing spy
<alexxm> how did u manage that Hellsliver
<Hellsliver> I use an combo of kunai and feign of death to walk over and over
<alexxm> u know i personally thought who wants to live forever would have been a better queen song for highlander
<Hellsliver> kunai lower the hp, but allow to heal 50% of max hp
<alexxm> ok thanks
<Hellsliver> per backstab
<alexxm> cool
<Fazana> Kunai is really hard to use, but it's brilliant when mastared
<Hellsliver> the feign of death are to trick my opponents into think they got me
<alexxm> i usaully play as heavy's
<Hellsliver> then I make them squel like a pig
<Fazana> I tend to like playing is SHNIPARGH
<alexxm> anyone thought who wants to live forever would have suited highlander better as it's theme music
<Hellsliver> every team need at least one pyro with regular flamethrower... aka the one with airblast
<Fazana> I feel like playing L4D
<Hellsliver> nice going as demo
<Fazana> If he likes doing this, he should use the highlander or the horsemanns axe.
<Hellsliver> yeah
<Hellsliver> I never got the axe
<Fazana> I got it the 2nd day
<Fazana> The first day, I didn't have a skullcutter
<Hellsliver> through trade or by beating the npc with melee?
<Fazana> then I got one random the next, so I yayed.
<Wrek> 05why? i love the zitochi
<alexxm> overtime is best time
<Hellsliver> I remember when overtime actually were a one life with melee only
<Fazana> Wrek: More max HP when you are rampaging, and you move faster too
<Fazana> Hellsilver: Still is, it's sudden death
<Hellsliver> I miss sudden death
<Hellsliver> it were the best with soldier and the shovel
<Hellsliver> hand grenade taunt makes it priceless
<Wrek> 05sincei manage such a high K/D
<alexxm> well that was quick
<Wrek> 05i survive logner by using the samurai sword
<Fazana> Still exists, noone wins during CTF, suddendeath happens
<Hellsliver> forget survival when you can make chaos?
<Fazana> Do I see Prince-Dari's favourite doctor there?
<Fazana> (Matt Smith)
<alexxm> so how come they're not using guns in this game
<Hellsliver> its medival map
<Wrek> 05its medieval mode
<Hellsliver> it deny modern tech
<Wrek> 05only blades n arrows
<alexxm> ok
<Jim|TF2> Dat server lagg
<Fazana> If you were Pinkie or the doctor, you could use guns
<r41nb0wd4sh> teeeeeeeeam fortress :D
<Hellsliver> Wonder if I should help wrek...

<r41nb0wd4sh> cuciii69
<Hellsliver> <---

<Jim> ohai Morty
<Azureflames66> HI thar Morty
<Hellsliver> I guess I know why she got the bubble mark
<LadyCanary> Also, speaking of bubbles.
<LadyCanary> http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lziyviznYJ1qkwo51.gif
<bartsonic> mare do well should appear more
<Morty> i wrote 20 pages of fanfic yesterday to make the deadline for the contest
<Morty> X_X
<F1uttershy> Hi everypony
<Jim> oh wow
<LadyCanary> Wowie!
<Hellsliver> so much fanfictions...
<Jim> Oh hi F1uttershy
<DerpyPie> :)x:|=worst shipping
<Morty> the limit is 10000 words, i have 9997
<bartsonic> bill cosby pony
<Hellsliver> Derpypie and yet it happened
<DerpyPie> IKR
<ScootaChicken> ewwww fanfiction
<RainbowJack> Derpypie dont agree on thath
<Azureflames66> Billy Neighs pony
<Kipkat07> hi everypony!
<Morty> Scootachicken: You don't like fanfiction?
<Jim> ohai Kipkat07
<Morty> Even the non shipping cool kind?
<DerpyPie> @jack That what is the worst in your opoinun
<Hellsliver> I wonder why there are no smileys of the royal sisters
<Azureflames66> *shrugs
<ScootaChicken> Morty: nah, I'm ok with fanfiction, I just don't read a lot of it
<LadyCanary> I'm not big on fanfiction. Especially super sentai yaoi fanfic...GRRR.
<Kipkat07> i couldnt figure out how to get the console in TF2 so i said buck it and gave up
<bartsonic> anyone else notice a pony with a cutie mark thats a spoon
<Tovler> i guess cus the sisters have weird horse faces
<ScootaChicken> but I've read fanfictions that have... scarred me.
<LadyCanary> I know dat feel.
<Azureflames66> go to advanced in options and it says enable developers console
<Morty> indeed scootachicken
<LadyCanary> Me and my friend literally screamed in fear when we saw this nasty ship-fic between our 2 favorite characters in Gokaiger.
<Morty> in my fanfic, Pinkie rages against fanfiction writers, and in an epic move she cries "This one's for my innocence!"
<Azureflames66> screamed?
<LadyCanary> It was....horrid.
<Azureflames66> literally?
<ScootaChicken> although I do remember sending a terrifying Tom Delonge x Mark Hoppus slash fic to my friend who's annoyingly into blink-182
<ScootaChicken> that was amusing
<RAWRity> in my fanfic, Celestia is swarmed in her sleep by a mass of black tendrils.
<ScootaChicken> seems legit.
<Shizuka> 13that's... lovely....
<LadyCanary> And also, the characters were completely off. I know it's fanfiction, but PLEASE, keep the characters to their personality, not some weak sex crazed freak.
<Jim> Sounds...fun..
<Azureflames66> lol lil miss rarityt
<LadyCanary> ...Goddammit RAWRity.
<bartsonic> ive seen enough hentai to know where thats going
<Azureflames66> rarity*
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: what?
<LadyCanary> You know what.
<Hellsliver> Shizuka I have a feeling that there might be some fanfics for the nightmares
<Morty> Rawrity: In a way I feel that is justice
<RAWRity> I did nothing to earn being goddammited
<LadyCanary> Ohrly.
<CountDoofus> in my fanfic, 5 of the Mane 6 have passed on, and the last one is soon to join them
<RAWRity> yarly
*LadyCanarysHat sits on LadyCanary's head

<BronyCon> LIES
<otakon> I never did
<StinkomanFan> OI ENGIS
<owlicious> you did what to the chicken
<Tovler> It was all apart of the Season 3 drama that Amy Keating Roger leaked.
<BronyCon> TIS A LIE!
<StinkomanFan> HOW'S THE PONI PORTAL
<LadyCanary> otakon: You know of the upcoming fighting game Skullgirls, right?
<Ingwaz|Laptop> Tovler: that s3 is in production?
<F1uttershy> yea
<[wub]Nidalee> im still hungry...
<otakon> LadyCanary: yh, the one that seems to be all eyecandy
<Tovler> It caused a Season-3-is-the-end panic
<BronyCon> IDJDKSOSJSODIEMDDFJCJDIEIEJE
<F1uttershy> how
<otakon> LadyCanary: what about it?
<StinkomanFan> Well, we could end up like Megas XLR
<Tovler> Tigerwong is working on SkullGirls.
<LadyCanary> otakon: You never know. But the 8th character in the roster was released and by Celestia, she is UNHOLY.
<Ingwaz|Laptop> Tovler: what about s3 specifically?
<bartsonic> anyone else wanna troll the troll
<otakon> LadyCanary: orlly? The titular Skullgirl I'm guessing
<LadyCanary> And there was a hint saying that another character might be released as a DLC >W<
<Pegasister16> Now Rainbow, my dear, I cannot express my delight!
<Colt_Of_Personality> i cant follow what is eveypony talking about
<[wub]Nidalee> bartsonic iiiii dooooo
<Ingwaz|Laptop> LadyCanary: characters have been planned as dlc for awhile
<[wub]Nidalee> im so bored.
<Azureflames66> me neither colt of personality
<ScootaChicken> eww fighting games
<LadyCanary> I know Ingwaz|Laptop, but I wasnt too sure. I wanna see Squigly as one :3
<Colt_Of_Personality> i hate not knowing what is being discussed
<Tovler> SkullGirls vs Galaxy Girls, hmm… Lauren should contact them.
<ScootaChicken> the only fighting game I'm good at it SSBB ._.
<ScootaChicken> *is
<StinkomanFan> Faust should poni poni
<LadyCanary> That's okay ScootaChicken ^-^
<F1uttershy> SSBB FTW
<Colt_Of_Personality> Mortal Kombat...
<Colt_Of_Personality> yay im in the conversation
<StinkomanFan> SSBB kinda killed the Smash Frainchise for me
<StinkomanFan> Not of itself but because the fans kept BITCHING
<Tovler> All I know is the fear of S3's fate was reported on EQD in November
<Jim> Fighting is Magic when it comes will be awesome
<LadyCanary> I too am not so good at fighting games, but I have a strong respect for them, especially the artwork and gameplay. Though my favorite is Arcana Heart.
<F1uttershy> i just like it cus its not as serious as other games probably is the same reason i love viva pinata
<Jim> Probably the only fighting game I would play
<StinkomanFan> Inb4 somepony breaks AJ
<Azureflames66> why violence in Equestria ;(
<RainbowJack> Jim: agreee i cant w8 till it gets released
<StinkomanFan> Why not?
<ScootaChicken> I've never really played any fighting games
<ScootaChicken> could never get into them
<Ingwaz|Laptop> Tovler: i shall simply have to have faith then, i can see little reason for them to end it
<StinkomanFan> Sad as it is you cannot make a country based on peace and nutrality
<StinkomanFan> Unless you are Poland
<Azureflames66> yup
<F1uttershy> iv only realy played soul calibur but i gave up on it
<bartsonic> omg guys what if when we die we turn into ponies in equestria
<Azureflames66> possible
<Azureflames66> far off but not impossible
<StinkomanFan> I'm the one who MADE that theory thank you very much
<SaggyApple> Poland and peace and neutrality in one sentence?
<Colt_Of_Personality> if thats ur heaven i guess
<Ingwaz|Laptop> bartsonic: if it was confirmed, give me a gun
<Pale_Horse> I do think that people get the type of afterlife they really want when they die
<Azureflames66> lol
<StickySyrup> why hello everypony
<Jim> ohai StickySyrup
<Azureflames66> hello
<LadyCanary> Hi StickySyrup!
<ScootaChicken> suddenly StickySyrup
<StinkomanFan> They have a town called Brony, of course it's going to be peaceful
<Pegasister16> OHAI, ScootaChicken!
<Colt_Of_Personality> yea
<StickySyrup> How are we all?
<ScootaChicken> wait... is asdfasdfasdg dari?
<Pale_Horse> Maybe there will be a pony community in the afterlife.
<ScootaChicken> hae there Pegasister16 ^_^
<Azureflames66> yes
<ScootaChicken> ...wait a minute
<bartsonic> hopefully
<StinkomanFan> Poni is on channel 300000000000000009
<Jim> I guess he is ScootaChicken, he's making the EQD updates frequently
<ScootaChicken> Pegasister16: has emangamer been telling you bad things about me?
<StickySyrup> ScootaChicken: did u record the stream on saturday?
<StinkomanFan> after Earth
<Azureflames66> if we find an alternate dimension wont that destroy the universe?
<Pegasister16> Soo... What are we talking about?
<ScootaChicken> StickySyrup: which stream?
<StinkomanFan> The afterlife
<StickySyrup> the episode
<StinkomanFan> And ponies in the afterlife
<bartsonic> going to euestria when we die
<StinkomanFan> And ponies in general
<StickySyrup> you said u were recording?
*Tovler starts an unincorporated Brony town in Montana.
<ScootaChicken> no...?
<Colt_Of_Personality> u become a background pony lol
<StickySyrup> oh
<Tovler> … or not
<StickySyrup> nm
<StinkomanFan> I'm ok with that
<TrixieMuffin> the universe is resilient , it doesnt care about what we think the laws of physics are supposed to be
<Ingwaz|Laptop> TrixieMuffin: it should be trixiepinecone
<StickySyrup> stream... y u no online
<Azureflames66> I wonder if we will ever find a planet with ponies as dominant species and smart like us and tlak like us
<Colt_Of_Personality> i would kinda live there if there was a town just for Bronies
<RainbowJack> WE ARE BRONIES RESITESN IS FUTIALE
<CountDoofus> heck, I'd be happy to be a background donkey if it meant I could be in Equestria
<StinkomanFan> Bumblebees are only able to fly because they don't know they can't
<StinkomanFan> >Your Brain when
<owlicious> i know i can't fly
<bartsonic> maybe pinkie will teach us of here physics destroying powers
<Colt_Of_Personality> That planet they found a long time ago its able to sustain life they no see whats on the planet itself
<Ingwaz|Laptop> RainbowJack: we are the herd, resistance is futile, assimilation is necessary
*LadyCanary giggles
<ScootaChicken> I haven't seen dari online a lot lately
<RainbowJack> HAHA

<MASF123> Reboot?
<Colt_Of_Personality> so dumb
<pony_2118> yeh
<[wub]Nidalee> I know I came.
<Shizuka> 13this is what happens when your game crashes
<otakon> String_Shredder: you don't have to watch it if you don't want to
<Dashie_Dashie> Reboot isn't dumb -___-
<Pale_Horse> Deresolution.
<Colt_Of_Personality> it kinda is
<otakon> good catch
<Shizuka> 13you know it's bad when it sucks in the skybox
<pony_2118> very
<otakon> lol
<pony_2118> alright
<pony_2118> who divided by 0
<Dashie_Dashie> this is what happens when hl2.exe is not responding
<MASF123> I used to watch it as a kid, but I have no clue what it was about
<DerpyDash> Put DB GT "Until we meet agian" or Cowboy Bebop for next livestream vid.
<otakon> Listen whiners you don't have to watch it if you don't want to!
<Dashie_Dashie> ^
<bartsonic> thank you Lauren Faust for making mlp good
<otakon> indeed
<pony_2118> really guys, you think we would have learned the first time we did that
<CountDoofus> so true otakon, I know I'm not
<MASF123> Lauren is great
<otakon> indeed she is
<DerpyDash> Lauren Faust is an alchemist: She can turn trash into gold
<MASF123> she is also explorin
<Dashie_Dashie> Ok donald trump.
<Dashie_Dashie> YOU'RE FIRED
<otakon> lol
<pony_2118> big bomb
<Shizuka> 13hex already had one
<DerpyDash> Thats what she said
<bartsonic> though she did leave a pony with derp eyes cause of a error that fans noticed
<DerpyDash> @vid
<otakon> which is probably true
<Shizuka> 13hack und slash are so thoughtful
<Pale_Horse> Why do villains insist on hiring the most intellectually relieved henchmen available?
<pony_2118> now whats the morale of this story? not to divide by 0
<otakon> bartsonic: but Derpy is the MASCOT of Bronies!
<alexxm> so why do the viruses want each other dead
<Shizuka> 13oshi volume
<Shizuka> 13

<CountDoofus> someone got mail
<Paradise92> cause Shizuka is streaming
<Paradise92> everyone here
<MASF123> Is it wrong to not like Transformers, but like Beast Wars?
<Shizuka> 13beast wars was done by the same team as reboot
<otakon> MASF123: not at all
<MASF123> :D
<bartsonic> i was confused i thought we were still on reboot lol
<DerpyDash> Booooooooooooooom
<MASF123> I mean, :)
<Saigneur> hey everypony, what is that ???
<Dark_Horst> just smack him already
<Shizuka> 13they built up so much history and fleshed out the universe, that's why it's so much better than the rest of the transformers series
<Dashie_Dashie> Dinobot = starscream
<bartsonic> i like tf prime and g1
<F1uttershy> im gona go off chat for now bye everypony :)
<otakon> Dashie_Dashie: no, that's Waspinator
<otakon> Dinobot is equal to boss
<Pale_Horse> I wonder if Dinobot actually stopped to wonder at any point what use that spinning tail-arm-thing actually was at any point.
<KwakLad> why voice commands for themselve, i never got that
<CountDoofus> Rattrap and Inferno. That's the only 2 names in Bears Wars I can remember
<Dark_Horst> is this one of the first eps?
<MASF123> Remember when the Powerpuff Girls watched a parody of this?
<bartsonic> beastwars needs more grimlock so does prime
<owlicious> cheater
<otakon> Dark_Horst: it's the second ep
<Shizuka> 13dinobot is more a melee fighter
<otakon> bartsonic: I agree
<Shizuka> 13the spinny thing would be a good shield against melee weapons
<Paradise92> oh god...
<Pale_Horse> I! Still! FUnction!!!
<Paradise92> this is sooo wrong
<Shizuka> 13except for the part where they fight with mostly energy weapons
<Colt_Of_Personality> well i have to go cya later my fellow bronies!
<otakon> he has a JETPACK!
<DerpyDash> The reactions to derpy talking in "The Lat Roundup" in this very chat! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geTCP666Yf4
<KwakLad> he is based on an ape
<bartsonic> hmmm what if after fall of cybertron they make a game based after this series
<Shizuka> 13yeah optimus had the idiot ball there for a bit
<MASF123> Is there a higher rank of a brony?
<otakon> DerpyDash: taht was Pinkie Pie room
<Shizuka> 13dinobot is best honorable fighter
<otakon> no not really
<DerpyDash> Oh
<otakon> Shizuka: agreed

<Paradise92> http://mylittleponycollecting.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/MLPs_as_humans.jpg would somepony watch this?

<Dark_Horst> wait... energo is cryptonite now?
<MASF123> Why not?
<Shizuka> 13remember, up to this point, energon hadn't been well defined
<Shizuka> 13this is like 1996
<bartsonic> no destroying of physics to girly not random at all
<alexxm> it was probably one of the easiest things to transform you just needed to move it's head and that was it
<otakon> eeyup
<MASF123> Bronycon?
<otakon> and Ratrap was the pessimistic sarcastic one
<RainbowJack> ratpack always so posetife

<PhrozenFire> I has a secret for you Otakon
<Shizuka> 13bartsonic: be respectful
<otakon> Pale_Horse: basically think of it like shielding
<otakon> PhrozenFire: fine wat?
<MASF123> yeah I'm bored too
<RainbowJack> Shizuka PLZ say you have a Samurai Pizza cat epi
<otakon> I'm not
<PhrozenFire> *I'm wearing banana slippers*
<Pale_Horse> Then why not build the proper shielding into their alt modes as well?
<Midnight_Tempest> beast wars starts off kinda slow but gets EPIC

<alexxm> oh i started watching later then you guy's then
<Midnight_Fyre> Ugh, the CG, it's worst than I remember
<otakon> and they all died anyway
<RoflBot> the CG looks pretty bad
<Midnight_Tempest> energon chain reaction... RUN!!
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: well compared to today'
<otakon> s stuff ofc
<Mutterguy> incoming resonance cascade!
<[wub]Nidalee> ARE YOU FEELING ENERGIZED!?
<Shizuka> 13this was also basically the pilot
<Midnight_Fyre> Even then. Remember, this came out after Toy Story
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Shizuka> 13not long though, 1996 iirc
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: remember, this WASN'T a movie studio
<Pale_Horse> Shows what a difference in budget can do.
<RoflBot> lol
<Dark_Horst> welp, there goes the robot crack
<Shizuka> 13reboot was 1994, first CG show ever
<DerpyDash> Derp it like a man. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA3O7V_yVcA&feature=related
<Midnight_Tempest> it was made in canada... this was some pretty awesome CG
<Midnight_Fyre> true
<RainbowJack> Bye bye everypony going to bed

<Shizuka> 13compare this to the best 3d games could do
<alexxm> night RainbowJack

<Midnight_Tempest> the CG in beast wars got crazy good in the later seasons
<Paradise92> BEEEAAAST WARS!
<ekips> beast wars! hell yeah
<MASF123> The rat sounds like that stupid ghost in a Caspar movie
<alexxm> dat title drop
<RainbowJack> goodnight all
<otakon> damn title drop
<Pale_Horse> Admittedly it is a lot better than the graphics in the originally Legacy of Kain... and I loved the Hell out of Legacy of Kain.
<otakon> night RainbowJack
<otakon> omg WISHBONE
<MASF123> Legacy of Kain was great...except the ending
<Dashie_Dashie> WISHBONE?!?!
<Dashie_Dashie> YES
<Midnight_Fyre> Yay, Wishbone!
<Midnight_Tempest> and... i cant watch this... never liked it much
<otakon> I wonder if this will be the Faustus episode
<Paradise92> ummm
<MASF123> WISHBONE!!!! :)
*Shizuka 13notes for future, beast wars is louder than reboot und wishbone
<Paradise92> rlly?
<alexxm> is this the dog from frasier
<otakon> no
<otakon> it's not
<Midnight_Fyre> Did anyone do a Read it and Weep/Wishbone crossover?
<otakon> actually Wishbone isn't me thing too much either
<Pale_Horse> I remember the episode when Whishbone did Goethe's "Faust".
<Paradise92> why are we watching a dog who was under drugs while they were making these?
<otakon> Pale_Horse: eeyup
<alexxm> i rember this from when i was a kid
<Paradise92> PEDOOOO ALERT!!!
<otakon> Paradise92: lol

<Shizuka> 13"joe, ellen, MOM, ding"
<Dark_Horst> we started on episode 1 with stragate
<otakon> alexxm: it was on last time
<Shizuka> 13we did start with ep 1 of all of these
<Shizuka> 13you just weren't here for it
<otakon> you just weren't there is all
<alexxm> oh ok
<otakon> I see a Skype friend calling!
<ScootaChicken> dat skype call
<MASF123> Legacy of Kain's ending was terrible
<Dashie_Dashie> dat ashtray
<Shizuka> 13but reboot is pretty self-contained, and both of these were two-part openers so there's some time to catch up
<MASF123> Ends in a cliffhanger
<otakon> Shizuka: you have a friend!
<the4th|work> skype call dere
<the4th|work> and hi

<MASF123> It is the 90's as we remember it
<Shizuka> 13told you guys, mid 90s was my clue to this :P

<Mutterguy> Shizuka i assume there will reruns
<Capn_fisty> hello mother, today i nearly got raped
<Shizuka> 13all three of these series are loooooong

<Midnight_Fyre> Someone should really do some sort of Read it and Weep/Wishbone crossover. Wishbone is actually closer to the structure of the episode than Reading Rainbow, which got one (for obvious reasons)
<otakon> my god
<Dashie_Dashie> This show so.. much.. nostalgia.
<otakon> Shizuka: your friend wants to talk to you dear
<Shizuka> 13not in boo radley's house!
<ScootaChicken> I think Astray wants to talk...

<Dashie_Dashie> May 3rd is offically pinkie pies birthday.
<Dashie_Dashie> xD
<alexxm> i vaugly rember this show just not any episodes
<otakon> Dashie_Dashie: you'd think April 1st would be
<MASF123> It can't be...The new episode came out on Feb 18th
<Midnight_Fyre> Just because the episode airs on a given day doesn't mean that's when it takes place
<otakon> okay, so brb gonnna play some ME3 MP
<bartsonic> may 3rd best day ever
<Dashie_Dashie> see ya otakon'
<The_4th_Wall> May 3; CONSTRUCT PARTY CANNON
<Revolution08> hi
<Shizuka> 13now that's a knoife
<MASF123> April 1st, the day of the fools would make more sense
<alexxm> i agree with Midnight_Fyre i mean what about episodes that happen on more than one day
<Paradise92> Shizuka look at this please
<Paradise92> http://ponykart.net/
<Shizuka> 13please don't link non-images during streams
<Shizuka> 13it's rude
<RaveBrony> So, whats going on now? O.o I keep leaving the chat and coming back x_x
<Paradise92> Shizuka but it is a GAME :D
<Paradise92> Ponykart!
<Pale_Horse> we're watchin Wishbone
<alexxm> we're watching wishbone
<RaveBrony> :O
<MASF123> How long do you think MLP:FiM will last?
<Paradise92> pedo alert...
<Paradise92> 8 seasons
<The_4th_Wall> FOREVER
<RaveBrony> Wow, i havent seen wishbone in Foreverrrrrrrr!
<Shizuka> 13he triggered a trap card
<alexxm> a long time hopefully
<Paradise92> My Little Dash confirmed it
<MASF123> 8 seasons?
<RaveBrony> I think 5 seasons at least....
<Midnight_Fyre> A long time if it keeps up quality. If quality starts to drop I hope they end it before it becomes an embarrassment like the Simpsons
<RaveBrony> ^^^
<MASF123> I would laugh my ass off if it winds up beating The Simpsons. :)
<Midnight_Fyre> Wasn't it supposed to Indian Joe, not Crazy Joe?
<RaveBrony> The longer the show drags on, the more material is going to be used up
<Pale_Horse> Nah. not forever. Eventually the series will delve into the far future for stories, with a new cast, and be known as "My Little Pony: The Next Generation".
<Shizuka> 13was it? never did actually read tom sawyer for myself

<Shizuka> 13mid 90s political correctness and all
<RaveBrony> Yeah, i guess
<MASF123> If Pinkie Pie ever dies in the last episode, that would make me cry

<pony_432332> Nah, that wouldn't happen
<fillyfillyy> MASF123: that would kill me too

<RaveBrony> Nopony would Die are you kidding me? :D

<Phase4> mods seem to be elsewhere right now, you might be ok
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> mods are always watching
<unfoundbug> mods are elsewhere post ponies?
<Dashie_Dashie> mfw episode 21 of season two is named "Dragon quest" also mfw the square enix game.
<flutter_spin> If she sees herself and actually benefits in someway, AWESOME. If she gets a note and it becomes a misunderstanding from her friends, booo
<Meanwhile> Mods being elsewhere isn't an excuse to overlook the rules.
<Paradise92> Mods are always watching...
<unfoundbug> but theyre are always mods

<Pale_Horse> So, will we get to see Scootaloo running aaway from a future gang on a Hoverboard?
<unfoundbug> chat histories are kept for a reason

<Meanwhile> If we're lucky Dr Whooves will crash through the library wall in a delorean.
<Pale_Horse> Scootaloo, you bojo! those boards don't work on water!

<Dashie_Dashie> This game = The battle for the internet
<PinkiePieCopy> And Tallest Purple says lasers aren't cool...
<Meanwhile> The battle for the internet would have more ponies.
<unfoundbug> quick the acta fighters are breaking through
<unfoundbug> you must take out the sopa mothership
<PinkiePieCopy> It would have more ponies, bunchies and memes
<Pale_Horse> For great justice... Take off every Zig.

<unfoundbug> bot posts it as it goes up
<Cypresswolf> Speaking of Dərpy, what is the ultimate fate of dərpy going to be? A: Rosario - "she's gonna apear. she's basically a higher tier backround pony now"

<PinkiePieCopy> all at oncee
<PinkiePieCopy> XD
<unfoundbug> hit its weakspot for massive damage
<Meanwhile> Cypresswolf: first I've heard of it.
<Pale_Horse> that only works on crabs.
<Dark_Horst> soooooo.... is there any ddeper plan behind randomly shooting the hull of that thing?
<Cypresswolf> A: Rosario - Its...true.I honestly didn't have any intentions of her being drunk, it was supposed to be dizzy. but I guess you guys consider that she is always drunk.
<Meanwhile> When did you hear that Cypresswolf?
<unfoundbug> i would aim for the engines at least
<unfoundbug> SKYPE!
<flutter_spin> YES! More explosions!
<Meanwhile> Ah you're still reading off the season 3 stuff.
<chubba> what game is this?
<Cypresswolf> Im skimming the ponychan chat interview with Ed Rosario
<Phase4> freespace 2? someone said that before
<Cypresswolf> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/res/36215933.html#36216028
<Phase4> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeSpace_2_Source_Code_Project :3
<Dark_Horst> i would aim for the windows. imagine how you could fuck up their day if some bad guy sits on the toilet, minding his own business when suddenly, SWOOOOSH, hello vacuum
<Meanwhile> Cypresswolf: that's technically a non image link, be more careful.
<PinkiePieCopy> #dude why did you do that
<Meanwhile> Phase4: same thing.
<PinkiePieCopy> ...
<PinkiePieCopy> oops
<Cypresswolf> Apologies. wont happen again
<Pale_Horse> Once more Unto the breach - Zarba the Human Cannonball.

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Good evening everyone!
<Pale_Horse> SPAAAACE!
<PinkiePieCopy> Scoot-Scootaloo you still planning to kill me?
<Phase4> Scoot-Scootaloo: http://derpy.me/MLuMn you have no idea
<PinkiePieCopy> Even after you killed me twice?
<Cipher> 0,14oh hai Scoot-Scootaloo
<Phase4> tis the best of evenings
<Meanwhile> Phase4: watch your links.
<Dark_Horst> holy swoosh
<flutter_spin> Oh Scoot. I got some blind bags from Toys R Us. ^^
*CriticKitten runs to go hide and sob from his injury. ;-;
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03PinkiePieCopy: No, i will not kill you :3
<Pale_Horse> Captain's Log: Space is vast, and full of... spacy... stuff...
<flutter_spin> United States too.
*PinkiePieCopy breaks all the scooters in the world
<Phase4> Meanwhile: not sure what you meen
<PinkiePieCopy> Really
<Pale_Horse> ... The ship is drafty and damp... I complain, but... nobody listens...
<Meanwhile> Phase4: that's technically a non image link, and those aren't allowed.
<Phase4> scootaloo episode confirmed :3
<Phase4> Meanwhile: ah, ok
<Cypresswolf> do you intend to have certain background ponies receive episodes like Big Mac and Cheerilee did??( Vinyl Scratch, Octavia, Berry, Et Cetera) ...
<Phase4> Meanwhile: so if i was to screenshot that it would be fine :P
<Cypresswolf> A: Rosario - obviously! Vinyl Scratch was actually my idea, when I was showing off my new One More Time - Daft Punk 12", and turntable, they were like "hey what about a pony who was a really cool old vinyl junkie dj" seemed like a joke, but it became a living reality
<PinkiePieCopy> brb
<unfoundbug> about berry punch drunk scene
<Saturn> 08,01apparently, fluttershy is best background pony
<Meanwhile> Phase4: Hm. You know, Idk about that.
<unfoundbug> it was truwe
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Now I can die happy...
<unfoundbug> confirmed by animator
<flutter_spin> At first I wanted mane6 episodes of them hanging out. Then I wanted 1 of the mane6 themed episodes. Now I don't care.
<Phase4> ohai Saturn
<Phase4> xD
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Actually, not until I actually see the episode...
<Saturn> 08,01unfoundbug: the what?
<Phase4> realy?
<Pale_Horse> Pow! Haha!
<Meanwhile> Scoot-Scootaloo: die happy in the knowledge that we'll watch it extra hard for you.
<unfoundbug> the thing about berry punch being drunk in a scene and it being removed
<Saturn> 08,01unfoundbug: oh, i never heard of that
<unfoundbug> neither had i till someone said on here recently
<flutter_spin> I just find it awkward when you don't see Rarity or Twilight in an episode. I want them to have some screen time
<DashWithRainbows> Scoot-Scootaloo You have your priorities straight...I am proud to call you <Insert name here>
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Are the rooms broken or something? they keep saying missing plug in
<Dark_Horst> aaaaw, i wanted to see is asplode
<unfoundbug> but just found confirmation from one of the animators
<Phase4> i assume this is ok to post: www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/res/36215933.html ed rosario, on of the animators, on ponychat
<Cypresswolf> Can you give us some descriptions of other scenes that were cut before they were aired (something we don't know about)? ...
<unfoundbug> apparently it was intended as "dizzy"
<Meanwhile> Arceus-pony|Fancy: depends which rooms you mean, if you mean the mane 6 channels, those are shut down except for streaming new episodes.
<flutter_spin> "Oh Rarity created this wig" ... *looks for Rarity* :(
<Cypresswolf> A: Rosario - not that much but okay,at one part in Trixies episode, twilight would whisper "i bet she has sunshine in every bag" as a homage to clint eastwood, but it was cut due to the drug reference (still doesnt mean it isnt a badass song)
<Meanwhile> Phase4: it isn't.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> What does it mean by missing plug in?
<Meanwhile> It means there is a plug in, and it's missing. Shrugpony.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Also I am sad now...my cat died....
<Phase4> Arceus-pony|Fancy:its missing a plugin, whats nots working?
*Phase4 hugs Arceus-pony|Fancy
<Pale_Horse> Ohhh no! Poor kitty. :(
<Meanwhile> Very sorry to here that Arceus-pony|Fancy.
<Meanwhile> hear*
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> No idea it just says im missing one
<Cypresswolf> Clint Eastwood - Gorillaz reference would have been awesome :)
<Phase4> Arceus-pony|Fancy: what i meen is where is it saying that
<Cipher> 0,14Sorry to hear that, Arceus-pony|Fancy
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Where the pitchures of the rooms should be
<flutter_spin> COOOOOOOL
<unfoundbug> :O there was a scene cut from the trixie episode with a clint eastwood reference
<Phase4> is the stream working for you?
<Cypresswolf> More to the answer - "and in one part applebloom would actually keep awkwardly asking bon bon about the apples until she fell in a bush, it was cut due to redundancy."
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> and at the bottom of the pages are the room names I can select
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> the stream works fine
<Syndicate> LOLOL
<Meanwhile> Arceus-pony|Fancy: they aren't presently online atm, that's probably why.
<Syndicate> Okay everypony...
<Syndicate> Who wants to help me name my OC?
<Phase4> Arceus-pony|Fancy: its a bug, you can ignore it. though it might meen you have an old version of flash
<Meanwhile> Chumpy Muttonchops.
<KwakLad> Hey Syndicate
<unfoundbug> i misheard that class...
<Syndicate> Hey KwakLad.
<Pale_Horse> The Hull has been breached and the Science is leaking out!!!
<Syndicate> Wanna help?

<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Im surprised my cat made it to 18,he had barley any fat on him, I could feel every bone on his body
<RoflBot> ?
<Dark_Horst> Pale_Horse mfw i got that reference
<Syndicate> Basically, My pony.
<Cypresswolf> There was a rumor that S2 has 28 episodes. Is this true>Also, was Luna Eclipsed the only time Luna appears?...
<Phase4> 18? wow, thats impresive
<flutter_spin> oh your pony. Ohhhhh
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Origional character, do not steal
<Cypresswolf> A: Rosario - mouth is zipped.but expect alot.

*Saturn 08,01stares directly at Syndicate's wingboner
<Syndicate> FUUUUUUUUU
<Saturn> 08,01swag.
<Syndicate> xD
<Meanwhile> I'm liking Frosty, in any case. It's Frosty looking.
<Cypresswolf> soo many people on ponychan...lagging like crazy just trying to scroll down the page
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> You know who can hear you scream in space? The thing that kills you
<unfoundbug> lol, mods are quiet until ponies are posted
<Saturn> 08,01Arceus-pony|Fancy: unless it blew you out an airlock
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Mods are asleep, post ponies
<Syndicate> So Frosty?
<unfoundbug> it wakes them up
<Meanwhile> I'm changing my A movie selection to Alien for all future lotto entries until it wins.
<Saturn> 08,01huh
<flutter_spin> Frosty Cream? uh Frosty Fly? uh
<Saturn> 08,01for some reason, my kindle session disconnected
<unfoundbug> Frosty Wingboner?
<Syndicate> So frosty? Some other ponies recomended "Sky".
<unfoundbug> sorry
<Meanwhile> Frosty Skybreeze
<flutter_spin> Royal Frosty
<TOY_PON3> Hey everypony :)
<Meanwhile> Allo TOY_PON3
<Syndicate> Hmm...
<unfoundbug> Heya TOY_PON3
<KetaminaDianePie> hey TOY_PON3 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<TOY_PON3> unfoundbug: You never added me on Steam :| Add me
<KwakLad> TOY_PON3: Oh you there, how do?
<unfoundbug> i can't see any requests
<Syndicate> Meanwhile...I like it.
<Dark_Horst> why do space missiles have fins???
<Syndicate> MEANWHILE IS THE WINNER!!!!!
<Meanwhile> Because fins look cool.
<TOY_PON3> unfoundbug: Hold on
<Syndicate> :D
<Meanwhile> A winner is me.
<Syndicate> ^
<Syndicate> Thanks everypony!
<unfoundbug> Dark_Horst increases the swag level
<Syndicate> I'll be back later!
<Meanwhile> Tata Syndicate.
<KwakLad> Syndicate: Frosty Sky is a bit breezy with the wing boner?
<unfoundbug> its like running faster with a knife, everyone knows you run faster with a knife
<TOY_PON3> later Syndicate
<unfoundbug> please note: my previous statement is a reference, running with a knife is a terrible idea
<Syndicate> xD
*Phase4 has been reading the ponychat thread
<Syndicate> Thank you KwakLad
<TOY_PON3> unfoundbug: What's your Steam name?
<KwakLad> Syndicate: No prob sorry i couldnt help :p bye
<flutter_spin> I never got the "wing boner" reference. I wish I could look past it, but the chat usually spots it dead on
<unfoundbug> same as my chat name
<Dark_Horst> what exactly happened on ponychan? i'm a bit confused
<Cypresswolf> Have there been any plans with the CMC and getting their cutie marks in S2 or S3? A: Rosario - Cutie Pox was probably the only episode that we thought about it, but we may see them getting a cutie mark(wink wink)
<TOY_PON3> Okay
<unfoundbug> Dark_Horst a confirmed animator from the show appeared
<flutter_spin> I guess the same could go with the "secret butt fun". Yeah ok, but why?
<Pale_Horse> Running with a knife is especially reccomended if you have the tier 3 Commando perk.
<Dark_Horst> interesting
<Meanwhile> CMC actually getting their cutie marks, that'd be a pretty big step away from the norm of young kids in cartoons.
<Meanwhile> Who never achieve anything meaningful ever.
<TOY_PON3> Phase4: What's your Steam name?
<Phase4> TOY_PON3: ariscop
<Vinyl> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wyNLpGZd1Tg/T0LN13zBlcI/AAAAAAAAf8E/jKe5sJ4-wXg/s1600/stocking_vinyl_by_jean_lovescutestuff-d4mi4ge.png.jpg
<flutter_spin> Be weird if Sweetie Belle got a mic cutie mark
<Meanwhile> Eyeballs, y u suddenly on firre?
<unfoundbug> if anyone sees Princess_Luna, the one whos obsessed with mane brushing
<unfoundbug> link her this please
<unfoundbug> http://khyperia.deviantart.com/art/Luna-279030250
<The_4th_Wall> Will do
<Meanwhile> Brushie brushie.
<Cypresswolf> Are you guys planning to END the series after season 3, or there are chances of a season 4? (and 5, and 6, and 95!) ...
<The_4th_Wall> Btw, that's awesome
<unfoundbug> Cypresswolf it will have to end sometime
<TOY_PON3> unfoundbug: Nice
<The_4th_Wall> ^MEanwhile
<flutter_spin> For some reason I felt Luna was more of a passive character. She is strong upfront because of her position, but really just wants to have fun like Fluttershy
<unfoundbug> then we will stalk lauren faust
<Kammerjunk> Derpy stays! I am happy now.
<Phase4> FIREFOX! Y U NO MULTITHREADED
<Saturn> 08,01i want sweetie belle's cutie mark to be this: http://du.cx/277
<Meanwhile> Even though Faust already left the team?
<unfoundbug> more luna eps pleeease
<TOY_PON3> Phase4: IKR?
<TOY_PON3> ^
<unfoundbug> i read all the fanfics already
<Cypresswolf> I know, All good things must eventually :) But Lets hope its not for a while yet - Rosario - I really want it to continue. and it must.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Come on now. You don't need a reason to stalk Faust.
<Phase4> unfoundbug: all of them. every single one
<unfoundbug> all that i could find
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: I'm too busy stalking someone else.
<Kammerjunk> You haven't even scratched the surface, man.
<unfoundbug> some of them were.... uncomfortable
<TOY_PON3> I bought a headset everypony ^^
<KwakLad> a .gif cutie mark! that would be amazing
<Phase4> TOY_PON3: :)
<TOY_PON3> :3
*Phase4 wishes he was alone more often so he could voicechat
<Kammerjunk> unfoundbug: Try searching through every page on EQD. Then read every. Last. One.
<flutter_spin> But I think people feel Luna is really bold all the way. I can't quite nail it. Seen her in what, 3 episodes?
<Meanwhile> It's rare Phase4 that someone aspires to be Forever Alone.
<Dark_Horst> ...they don't make games like this anymore
<Saturn> 08,01would someone brush my mane?
<Dashie_Dashie> Lauren Faust has created something new! http://fyre-flye.deviantart.com/journal/other-stuff-I-do-285892128
<unfoundbug> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Kammerjunk> <urd, <
<Kammerjunk> Sorry.
<Phase4> Meanwhile: not forever, just alone long enough for a game. theres allways someone around
<Pale_Horse> I'm sure if the sad day ever comes that the MLP series ends, everyone will be able to move onto the NEW series - My Little Bears: Mauling is Magic
<unfoundbug> ah yes, new superwoman show
*The_4th_Wall brushes Saturn's mane
<Kammerjunk> Yes, Supergirl. It's Faust, so it has to be quality. I'll definitely check it out when it's released.

<Kammerjunk> Seriously, wow. Hold on.
<DeadlyDerp3> Why is there static?
<Phase4> "Derpy Hooves: $2,151" is what google told me
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, that sounds about right.

<Cypresswolf> Mr. Rosario what's your opinion about the alicorn Princess Cadence? - A: Rosario - wasnt my idea. didnt think she was good. as result too much fanart.
*Everlasting_Joy looks back to the landing plane without a care of DeadlyDerp3 a la "Airplane!"
<flutter_spin> Reminds me of Big Bang Theory when the girl handed him a napkin of the famous guy
<Pale_Horse> "Bacon! We must be underneath a BACON TREE!"
<flutter_spin> U.S.S. Bacon reporting for duty
<Pale_Horse> hehe
<Phase4> wat
<Phase4> wait'
<Phase4> i know that voice
<DeadlyDerp3> It's the Bacon ship
<DeadlyDerp3> ...
<DeadlyDerp3> Why does it look like a moth, though?
<Phase4> mass effect 1, the vi on ios
<DeadlyDerp3> It looks like Saturn want's to pin it to a wall :p
<flutter_spin> coooooool
<The_4th_Wall> Pew pew pew
<Dark_Horst> ooooooouuuh... trippy nebula
<unfoundbug> 6 sentry guns!
<KwakLad> Liquidic space
<DeadlyDerp3> Well, great, I can't see a goddamn THING
<KwakLad> ohh no Fluidic space
<unfoundbug> Fluidic space?? 8472! run!
<DeadlyDerp3> So...Space is basically like flying in the air, right :P?
<KwakLad> thank you unfoundbug
<Hazard> ohai
<Pale_Horse> They're more properly known as the "Undine".
<flutter_spin> Its like Plasma Pong :P
<Kammerjunk> DeadlyDerp3: Eh he. He he he.
<unfoundbug> Borg designation is cooler
<Kammerjunk> Sure.
<Meanwhile> Species 8472 will mess you up.
<DeadlyDerp3> Wait, this is Star Trek Crappidy Crap!?
<Pale_Horse> I can't argue with that. :P
<Phase4> Saturn: http://derpy.me/Os1ZC
<flutter_spin> hey now, its Star Trek. Don't dis it
<DeadlyDerp3> Man, these graphics of NOTHING are astounding!
<Cypresswolf> Do you know of any more Doctor Whooves/timepony cameos? - A: Rosario - dunno, probably might. as long as its not close, and BBC wont notice, we could.
<Hazard> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXkx-PSwbG4
<Meanwhile> The game itself is not Star Trek, but that large amount of green does look kinda like fluidic space.
<unfoundbug> Hazard no youtube links while stream is up
<Hazard> D:
<DeadlyDerp3> PANIc
<DeadlyDerp3> Oh wait

<Hazard> alright ^_^
<DeadlyDerp3> False alarm
<Phase4> suddenly livestream
<Kammerjunk> Cypresswolf: That's the second best thing anyone has ever said in an interview. "and BBC wont notice"
<KwakLad> Phase4: That describes the Saturn we know perfectly... right?
<Cypresswolf> :)
<Phase4> pony_1604: dat facebook
<flutter_spin> Facebook. Heh. I honestly did not catch it the first time
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Is this that new game where you can play with the Joystick?
<DeadlyDerp3> SATURN WHERE DId you goooooo :'(!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sorry, slowpoke here :3
<Phase4> Scoot-Scootaloo: freespace 2
<DeadlyDerp3> Oooo, TWO MINERS DOOOWWWN
<Kammerjunk> The best thing being "she's gonna apear. she's basically a higher tier backround pony now." about Derpy.
<Hazard> hey unfoundbug
<Phase4> never played it myself, looking at getting it
<Hazard> "Would you make me a sandwich?"
<Phase4> aparently the engine is open source
<Everlasting_Joy> Oh chocolate French silk pie. Easily one of the greatest advancements in cullinary science.
<Dark_Horst> cypresswolf why not make the doc run across the background with derpy at random moments? that would work
<unfoundbug> no
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Ah~
<DeadlyDerp3> With the amount of ships this pilot has taken down, shouldn't they be the red baron of the STAR FLEET?
<flutter_spin> My brain was out of wack during that scene. My thoughts: "Oh Pinkie Pie, why? *facepalm* Oh its Pinkie Pie *continues watching*
<Pale_Horse> Ok. it's been fun, but it's 8:00 here now and I haven't eaten anything since breakfast. So i'm gonna go make some pizza.
<Phase4> later Pale_Horse
<Everlasting_Joy> So what are we watching here?
<Pale_Horse> Ciao everypony. ;D
<Kammerjunk> Also, it's neat that they got the idea for Vinyl Scratch via Daft Punk music. One More Time is one of my favourite Daft Punk works.
<Phase4> freespace 2
<Kammerjunk> Pale_Horse: Have fun with that.
<unfoundbug> wow, 1am and iv only been awake for just over an hour this is a wierd feeling

<Phase4> i've got like 200 lines of code i need to write but i'm here instead
<Kammerjunk> I usually go to sleep at 3 AM.
<DeadlyDerp3> What other distinguishing landmarks are there?
<Meanwhile> One does not simply go to sleep.
<Everlasting_Joy> Phase4 I know that feeling, or at least the "I"m here" piece.
<DeadlyDerp3> Well, there's gas, and OH LOOK, It's Saturn :P
<Meanwhile> Hush now quiet now it's time to lay your sleepy head...
<Meanwhile> zzzzzzzzzzz
<Cypresswolf> well...interview is slowing down now. seems to be about over. back to the stream for me

<Meanwhile> Bleach?
<Dark_Horst> oi... where'd the stream go?
<Hazard> "Yes he was human. But he was also Chicken and Waffles!"
<unfoundbug> Shizuka thats a dangerous blanket statement
<Kammerjunk> Whiskey is the best.
<Everlasting_Joy> Is someone else going to stream in a short time?
<Kammerjunk> I cannot stress this enough.
<DaringDude> how long till its online?
<Meanwhile> Dishwater?
<Phase4> Saturn: D'awwww

<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: You should take to drinking whiskey, then.
<Kammerjunk> Whiskey is awesome.
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile I ate a bowl of milk for breakfast!

<Saturn> 08,01i have no idea what that link is
<Cypresswolf> How many whiskey drinkers we got in the stream?
<Saturn> 08,01i've not been to it yet
<Saturn> 08,01if it's nsfw, i apologise
*Kammerjunk raises a hoof.
<DaringDude> i do on occasion
<DaringDude> good burn
<Phase4> the ed rosario ponychat thread
<Kammerjunk> How did I just accidentally get into ponychan without noticing?
<Saturn> 08,01i like ale
<Phase4> good read actualy, go read it
<Cypresswolf> Amen to that, DaringDude
<Meanwhile> I only drink smirnoff ice. Unless it's a party, in which case I mix everything I can find into one glass and drink that. Not always a bright move.
<Saturn> 08,01and mead
<Hazard> NUMBERS NUMBERS!
<DaringDude> nordic mead?
<Meanwhile> Saturn is a nord.
<Meanwhile> Sorry, nerd.
<DaringDude> i hear that increases stamina
<Kammerjunk> Cypresswolf: I second this notion.
<KwakLad> Saturn like your style both are good, though not together
<Kammerjunk> Mead is alright, I guess.
<Hazard> HonningBrew Mead? *snort snort*
<mario_pony> hi
<DaringDude> lol

<Dark_Horst> that's the crappy shit
<Cypresswolf> I like to go a little bit better in quality and reach for Gentlemen's Jack
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03To train them is my cause!
<Dark_Horst> good whiskey is, sadly, expensive
<Meanwhile> Scoot-Scootaloo: you missed a line.
<Paradise92> to catch them is my real test
<Kammerjunk> Cypresswolf: I mostly drink Jack Daniel's myself, but that's because I'm 15 and I can't choose what brand.
<TOY_PON3> Digimon is better
<Paradise92> to train them is my cause.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03darn...
*Meanwhile dunk TOY_PON3 with a cinderblock.
<Kammerjunk> I had some mead once, at this viking-themed event. I could drink it, sure, but it wasn't awesome.

<Everlasting_Joy> Scoot-Scootaloo I think Lucario would like a word with you.
<unfoundbug> oh hey Nittany_Discord
<Paradise92> the power that's inside
<flutter_spin> ugh. I tried making myself a pony, but I can't do it.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: You know, that overused R34 Pokémon.

<TOY_PON3> Wtf is Pokemon R34?
<Paradise92> Pokemon!
<Cypresswolf> *refreshing page*
<Paradise92> Oh your my best friend
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Neither do I, but I just Google'd "Gardevoir" in Google Images. Which has safety off by default.
<Meanwhile> TOY_PON3: never you worry your pretty little head about that.
<Kammerjunk> :why:
<unfoundbug> flutter_spin I know right, move the tab adn the damn thing refreshes
<TOY_PON3> Meanwhile: Okay :3
<Paradise92> in a world we must defend
<Kammerjunk> And then I remembered it from a thread on /b/.
<Paradise92> Pokemon! Gotta catch'em all!
<Dark_Horst> 1.75? did it give you an irish singing voice?
<KwakLad> WAIT! Why were we singing pokemon, what about Bronymon?
<Paradise92> a heart so true
<Meanwhile> Back in my day Pokemon only went up to Mewtwo.
<TOY_PON3> ^
<Paradise92> our courage will put us through.
<Kammerjunk> >Mewtwo
<Kammerjunk> I actually know that name.
<Paradise92> You teach me and I'll teach you
<mario_pony> hi

<Paradise92> Gotta catch'em all!Gotta catch'em all!POKEMON!
<Meanwhile> Or i'm gonna get nostalgic on your ass.
<flutter_spin> I didn't mind Red & Blue. Then Silver & Gold were fine. After that, I just thought "ok, now they are milking it"
<PinkiePieCopy> I am back
<TOY_PON3> I remember that glitch to catch Mew :3
<Dark_Horst> i liked gold. nice graphics
<Cypresswolf> Well, Im Scotch Irish by decent, If I didnt have one already, I certainly do now :)
<PinkiePieCopy> ;/
<Meanwhile> I can't even remember all the original Pokemon anymore. It's been that long.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: The only time I have had ANYTHING to do with Pokémon was when I saw Pokémon: The First Movie as a child. I have never owned the cards or games or seen the show.
<flutter_spin> I guess it didn't make sense to me that all of a sudden there were more pokemon.
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: did you grow up in the desert, eating cacti for nourishment?
<Kammerjunk> Nope.
<Kammerjunk> I grew up with BOOKS.
<Paradise92> me starts singing digimon intro...japanese version

<Kammerjunk> And guess what. NOT ENOUGH BOOKS.
<TOY_PON3> Twilight would know what books are ._.
<Meanwhile> I don't even like books.

<Saturn> 08,01regarding deleted scenes, one of thanimators said "at one part in Trixies episode, twilight would whisper "i bet she has sunshine in every bag" as a homage to clint eastwood, but it was cut due to the drug reference (still doesnt mean it isnt a badass song)"

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Hi~
<Meanwhile> In all honesty, who would you rather get a nuzzle from, otakon or Luna?
<Dark_Horst> hell yeah amnesia.
<otakon> I'm a white heterosexual male, I don't mind hugs but nuzzling from guys is where I draw the line
<emangamer> Scoot-Scootaloo: thats not sexism. sexism is discrimination, while otakon is simply not secure in his masculinity, hense his not likeing me nuzzeling him
<PinkiePieCopy> Woona
<unfoundbug> there seems to be a lot of new luna art on deviant art lately
<PinkiePieCopy> =3

*Meanwhile peers over Scoot-Scootaloo's shoulder.
<emangamer> PhrozenFire: yelling isnt going to get anyone to want to do it
<emangamer> otakon: and yet you dont like me nuzzeling me???
<otakon> PhrozenFire: ask nicely
<PinkiePieCopy> NOPONY WANTS TO BE A SQUIDWARD
<unfoundbug> wars should be replaced with hugging competitions, whoever lets go first loses
*otakon facepalms again
<Meanwhile> True, otakon watched the show in a public library. That takes stones.
<unfoundbug> i would win so many wars
<PartyCannon> dat feel when Ed Rosario's thread 404s
