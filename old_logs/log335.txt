*otakon noms on gifted ham
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> O_O A stream, finally
<MirrorImage> ...ok, i know this isn't Portal, so what is this?
<otakon> ValtheJean: I would LOVE to see that in action! I've heard good things
<Mutterguy> ham? Unless this is Fallout equestria , i ain't touching have ham and nor should you
<Dismo> Oh my god, I keep forgetting iI have this tab open.
<otakon> MirrorImage: it's F3AR
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's a good game
<Arentius> Mount and blade was a quality game!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but I need to install it
<Dismo> I heard steam go off.
<Arentius> I remember playing the beta
<otakon> I haven't played it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that, and Vampire Masquerade
<otakon> I have not the funds
<IshBestPony|HamMane> Mutterguy ham hater
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> How would the mane 6 react to three meat pizza?
<otakon> ValtheJean: OOH! VM, play VM!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have tons of steam games, with a fraction of them installed.
<otakon> Great game!
<StinkomanFan> Everytime I stay in manechat I feel my brain is being insulted
<SkilledSkillet> Terribly Kira
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I figured as much
<Phase4> hmmmm, /me has to test something
<Mutterguy> I just assumed ponies are supposed to be vegetarian
<Dismo> Holy man, I have 19 steam games.
<StinkomanFan> So, how is everypony this FINE evening?
<IshBestPony|HamMane> Mutterguy its doesn't come from an animal, it comes from my magical ham mane
<Randomnerd> They might be lacto-vegetarians, they have moo-cows
<MirrorImage> Dismo - if you're referring to Fallout Equestria, remember that it's set about 200 years later from present Equestria
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> *sigh* ads
<RaveBrony> dat music :|
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> DAT EAR-RAPE
<Mutterguy> ok, i guess that morks althouhgh meat is still bad for ponies
<LordCelestia> 0,5Skatabelepodiapelapelapelapelapedalado
<otakon> mein ears!
<Dismo> MirrorImage: Huh?
<Dashie_Dashie> Sooo... what are we playing?
<Mutterguy> *works
<otakon> F3AR
<LordCelestia> 0,5Y SB LEEVE US
<StinkomanFan> That's nice Celestia
<otakon> because he has school?
<Dashie_Dashie> Fear? AWESOME.
<Randomnerd> I mean, Veganism takes on different meaning when you can actually have a coversation with the critters that produce your food...
<otakon> darn you laggy stream!
<Randomnerd> conversation*
<TrixieMuffin> My little Alma : Fearship is Madjik
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> You don't think they'd tolorate the vsrity of human foods, even if they don't eat them?
<Dashie_Dashie> prepare to shitbrix for anyone who hasn't played fear before.
<IshBestPony|HamMane> A Hamless man cannot be trusted
<SkilledSkillet> Ive beat this game like 3 times
<LadyCanary> Never played before.
<RaveBrony> lol!! I love fear soo much
<Randomnerd> The ponies MUST have some sort of arrangement with the cows.
<StinkomanFan> It's giving a psychic a gun defeating the purpose of him being psychic in the first place?
<RawketLawnchair> The hell is that?
<LadyCanary> ...Oh mywhat.
<pony_a> ok, did that work?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> dafaq?
<otakon> wat da fuq!
<Randomnerd> Oh, my...
<SkilledSkillet> My friends go them fear in different orders so of course I had to play it with all of them
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> You guys don't think that the ponies would at least tolorate our varity of human foods, i.e. meats?
<otakon> Randomnerd: yeah, they keep the cows fed and house them, and the cows provide milk.
<Dashie_Dashie> will admit, I'm not scared of much but this game has made me jump and possibly scream many times.
<StinkomanFan> And the entire aspect of a horror game entirely?
<otakon> Kira_Pony_Yamato: doubt it, they'd get sick on it
<SkilledSkillet> I dont think so Kira
*IshBestPony|HamMane hugs Fleur
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> No, i mean tolorate the existence of said food, not nesscerly eat them
<Ingwaz> i imagine the ponies would not necessarily be surprised by the fact that humans eat meat
<otakon> hi Cy!
<Ingwaz> after all, wild animals eat meat, bears, hydras, all those things
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Sorry, wasn't clear on that.
<otakon> Kira_Pony_Yamato: sure, look at Owlowious
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> True
<Ingwaz> if however i was to move to equestria, i would be happy to change to a vegeterian diet
<otakon> they KNOW he eats mice
<Randomnerd> The Gryphons must be Omnivorous.
<RaveBrony> dat ad on my screen...
<StinkomanFan> So Mortee what are your thoughts on giving a horror hero a gun?
*IshBestPony|HamMane hugs Fleur again
<otakon> Ingwaz: me too, salad wouldn't be bad with cheese and dressing only
<pony_a> this seems to be working
*pony_a is Phase4
<Randomnerd> Then again, most brony headcanon assumes Gryphons and Ponies don't get along well.
<pony_a> lol, heard my own ding
<otakon> and I LIKE a nice hearty veggie sooup
<Ingwaz> not even necessarily just salad, i'm sure the ponies have a variety of foods
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> *shoots ad with 50 cal sniper rifle*
<Yahooz> Phase4 why?
<Ingwaz> after all, pinkie is a glutton
<StinkomanFan> I'm so alone :c
<RaveBrony> lol^
<Dashie_Dashie> ponies have cake that they never get fat off of.
<Dashie_Dashie> i'mokwiththis.
<IshBestPony|HamMane> Gryphons eat horses in mythology
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> ...
<otakon> Randomnerd: well, it seems to me that it's not that they don't get along, it's that Gryphon's are fairly rare in Equestria on whole.
<pony_a> testing recording multiple channels at once
<Randomnerd> True, IshBestPony|HamMane
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Maybe I need to catch up on my mythology..
<otakon> yeah
<Dashie_Dashie> Lol.. who's streaming..?
<Ingwaz> no... Dashie_Dashie, pinkie does say that if she eats too much cake then she gets a pudge and then she cant budge
<otakon> ValtheJean:
<Dismo> Not much in a movie or game can make me Jump anymore, The only thing that can get me going is a creepy story or eerie Character , That's why I prefer oldie horror, Most of them have a better story then the shit theese days. Like the Shinining, That always beats the shit out of me.
<MirrorImage> and i'm sure there's some mistrust when you consider that equines are a primary food source for griffons in common mythology
<pony_a> i have 6 copies of lightirc on my screen, only three are working right now though
<pony_a> any more and the network yells ate me
<pony_a> at'
<otakon> MirrorImage: maybe, but it looks like Griffons can eat veggies and fruit as well
<Dashie_Dashie> Who ever is streaming is having alot of fun with the slide attack.
<Dashie_Dashie> XD
<MirrorImage> oh certainly they can
<otakon> that is a crazy looking shottie
<StinkomanFan> Sp this is where everypony is
<Randomnerd> In MLP, they cannot eat Ponies, otherwise the Ponies would have to destroy gryphons on sight.
<MirrorImage> but if you lived on Steak for all your life and were suddenly told "no more steak. eat only salads..."
<IshBestPony|HamMane> bai everypony
<Randomnerd> Bye, IshBestPony|HamMane
*IshBestPony|HamMane hugs and gives ham to Randomnerd
<SkilledSkillet> byw ish
<otakon> GRAB MY SHOTTIE LIKE JOHN GOTTIE! Hell yeah! FUCK YOUR COUCH!*as my friend used to say*
<SkilledSkillet> *bye
*Randomnerd noms ham
*IshBestPony|HamMane and SkilledSkillet

<SkilledSkillet> Yes!

<RaveBrony> noooo D:
<StinkomanFan> Ok, I came back
<Ingwaz> angwy pwotting woona is adowable woona
<Randomnerd> Gryphons must eat meat, but can't eat Ponies, otherwise Gilda wouldn't have been permitted to attend Junior Flyers camp.
<RaveBrony> Awww, cute pic
<StinkomanFan> I hope you all have stopped being silly
*IshBestPony|HamMane leaves ham foar everypony
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Command "Disregard locals" Me: "I hope you die a horrbile, painful death, you assmuncher."
<Dashie_Dashie> that picture made me Dawww
*IshBestPony|HamMane the ham haz been instructed to give hugz as you nom it
<StinkomanFan> Of course I miss the picture
<Dashie_Dashie> http://th03.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2012/029/b/e/_equestrius__by_jdan_s-d4o1nsg.jpg
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fthreeear is suddenly CoD.
<otakon> lol
<RaveBrony> :o
<StinkomanFan> Not very scary is it?
<SkilledSkillet> Lol indeed
<Dashie_Dashie> Lol he's having to much fun with the dash attack.
<Dismo> Would Luna not have been born with her cutie mark?
<StinkomanFan> Yes
<Randomnerd> Probably.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I played Fear 1, but I didn't stay interested enough in it to finish it.
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> me too
<Randomnerd> It is likely even Alicorns have to get them.
<otakon> my GOD it felt so boring at times
<StinkomanFan> Stop being so damned UNSCARY game!
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> If someone told me to disregard locals and even shoot them, I'd help my 'target'
<otakon> Dismo: not sure tbh
<SkilledSkillet> Oh game you so silly!
<otakon> Kira_Pony_Yamato: that makes you a bad soldier then, but a good human being
<StinkomanFan> Giving the hero of a horror game a gun kind of defeats the whole: terrified of everything
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I'd rather be a bad soldier, if it meant being a good human being.
<Dashie_Dashie> FFFFFUUUUUUU No cover
<StinkomanFan> Hide behind a burning car GENIOUS
<SkilledSkillet> Seems legit
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know.
<Randomnerd> StinkomanFan: It's entirely possible to be afraid while holding a gun
<StinkomanFan> Alright I got a magic 8 ball, ask me any yes or no questions
<pony_3787> Hey so I have a pony question
<pony_3787> Who is Shining Armor?
<Randomnerd> Is Luna coming back for more eps
<Randomnerd> ?
<StinkomanFan> Yes
<SkilledSkillet> Will I sing tommorow Stinkomanfan?
<pony_c> #bronystate << better place to ask, or you could check the mlp wiki
<Randomnerd> Yaaaay!
<StinkomanFan> Most likely
<Dashie_Dashie> Will humans ever go to equestria?
<SkilledSkillet> I knew it!
<RaveBrony> Why would they not use her again? lol
<StinkomanFan> No :c
<Dashie_Dashie> D:
<SkilledSkillet> :'(
<Dken2021> Will hipster ever stop being hipsters?
<SkilledSkillet> It;s cole macgrath!
<StinkomanFan> Yes
<otakon> what the hell?
<Dismo> StinkomanFan: Will there be atleast 4 seasons and a movie of FIM?

<pony_a> herp derp
<StinkomanFan> Yes Dismo
<RaveBrony> I would love it if there was a MLP movie.

<SkilledSkillet> Will I ever find true happiness Stinkomanfan?
<LadyCanary> I believe so.
<Phase4|RecordingTest> ok, mips.tv is the best to test it on due to its slow
<MirrorImage> in the mean time, i'm going back to Fallout NV
<StinkomanFan> Outlook good
<SkilledSkillet> Yay!
<RaveBrony> Lol! mlp fim movie then xD
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> What are the odds that Cod will eventually die..
<StinkomanFan> That's not a yes or no question
<MirrorImage> Kira_Pony_Yamato - i give it 3 more years before it does
<Dashie_Dashie> dat reload whoring.
<Randomnerd> Someone pointed out that the actors in the MLP movie had over 30 awards between them.
<Dismo> MirrorImage: Who's yourfavorite companion?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Damn...
<MirrorImage> solo kthx
<MirrorImage> ED-E at most

<Dashie_Dashie> We should do a Tomb Raider night! :D
<StinkomanFan> Yes Skillet
<SkilledSkillet> Awwwwww
<MirrorImage> Kira_Pony_Yamato - Bronystate chat is flash based, so if your Android can run flash, it should
<RawketLawnchair> This isn't working.
<MirrorImage> otherwise, it's standard IRC, so an Android IRC client could get you in
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Awesome!!
<StinkomanFan> Next question
<SkilledSkillet> That was a friendly steam chat
<Dismo> I can only seem to run a few select pc games, LIke WoW and Any of the older GTA games. Saints row and Sonic Genarations are slow, If anyone has steam or PSN. :I I would love more friends on either.
<SkilledSkillet> I have steam Dismo
<StinkomanFan> Next pony question?

<RawketLawnchair> Not Red.
*Dermathil waves and walks out.
<RaveBrony> Randomnerd, where you get it? :o
<StinkomanFan> You missed the othe colors
<Randomnerd> It's the perfect way to count down the days to Bronycon.
<Randomnerd> I bought it at a CVS

<StinkomanFan> Oh look a mall in a horror game
<StinkomanFan> How original
<RaveBrony> lol
<Randomnerd> Now I can say I've supported the show ;)
<RawketLawnchair> All dat wasted food.

<RawketLawnchair> That's ridiclous, RaveBrony
<RaveBrony> But sadly im too damn small for the belt....
<RaveBrony> Why, RawketLawnchair? D:
<Dashie_Dashie> I can haz belt :3
<RawketLawnchair> Toy gotta hid your power level, RaveBrony
<Randomnerd> You might be able to buy a belt kit and attach the buckle to that.
<Arentius> awh
*Arentius hugs StinkomanFan
<RawketLawnchair> Wait, what?
<StinkomanFan> OPEN DOOR
<RawketLawnchair> Ooigh.
<Dermathil> lol fail
<RawketLawnchair> That doesn't look healthy.
<Dermathil> the fear series really lost their scary components.
<RaveBrony> Its a shame they only have RD....id like the mane 6 belts.... But, my friends bought me those 2 mlp items, im not sure if id spend much money on such things
*Kira_Pony_Yamato can't see through the ad
<StinkomanFan> Oh boy ZOMBIES in a mall, truely we've reached the height of originality
<Dermathil> not zombies.
<Dashie_Dashie> ghots
<Randomnerd> Tandy leather sells belt kits. Alternatively, you could just punch a hole in the belt.
<Dermathil> ghosts and paranormal stuff.
<Dashie_Dashie> ghosts*
<StinkomanFan> ZOMBIE GOASTS LEAVE THIS PLACE
<Fleur> whatcha playing?
<RaveBrony> Yeah, but have you seen the RD belt? Id want the others.... but what wud they say?
<SkilledSkillet> Fear
<StinkomanFan> Oh the ladder broke, how scary
<RaveBrony> You cant just have 'yay' on the fluttershy belt :\ perhaps, 'Youre going to love me!"? lol
<StinkomanFan> :[<This?
<Randomnerd> RaveBrony: You could punch a hole in the belt with a hammer, nail, and a brick it wouldn't be perfect, but you'd be able to fit your waist
<Fleur> I didnt know F3AR was multiplayer :o
<SkilledSkillet> Yes that stinkomanfan
<Fleur> I might have to get that now
*Fleur loves multiplayer coop
<Phase4> so hows this look? http://youtu.be/a1LkR6dGWns
<Phase4> sugestions welcome
*SkilledSkillet love multiplayer coop as well
<RaveBrony> But, its a seatbelt buckle belt :o
<StinkomanFan> Yay! I'm on the vidya!
<SkilledSkillet> Not bad Phase4
<Dashie_Dashie> Phase4: chat's a bit blurry for me, not sure if that's the rending though.
<Phase4> Dashie_Dashie: yeah, thinking of resizing it
<Phase4> looks fine in 480p
<RaveBrony> Thats good Phase4 :P
<Randomnerd> RaveBrony: Damn! It's too small, then?
<Dashie_Dashie> other than that it's great :>
<StinkomanFan> TV's don't scare me anymore
<Phase4> thats alot of tv's
<Phase4> aww, there all broken
<SkilledSkillet> Awwww so much tv wasted :'(
<StinkomanFan> It's a department store, of course they have TV's
*Phase4 has to turn of the stream
<RaveBrony> Well, its not really too small, its just difficult to put on at the place i have it at x_x
<RaveBrony> But i have it hanging on my wall so you can read the words :P
<StinkomanFan> He possessed some dolt in a trucker's costume
<Phase4> so no real sugestions about the video beyond text is a bit small?
<Dashie_Dashie> nope
<SkilledSkillet> It looks fine Phase4
<RaveBrony> ^
<StinkomanFan> Open DOOR
<Phase4> ok, i'l record it like that for the next episode
<RaveBrony> :D
<StinkomanFan> I don't see how Bullets would kill ghosts
<RaveBrony> Sweet
<SkilledSkillet> Da freezer ghost!
<Phase4> 1. use bullet on ghost
<Phase4> 2. ????
<RaveBrony> Haha!
<Phase4> 3. PROFIT!
<RawketLawnchair> Dammit Alma.
<RaveBrony> ^
<otakon> oh look
<StinkomanFan> Cast revive on ghost girl
<SkilledSkillet> Alma you so silly gurl
<otakon> dual weilding
<StinkomanFan> ????
<otakon> blargh
<StinkomanFan> Profit!
<Randomnerd> But are those shirts and such licensed Hasbro Products?
<otakon> what the HELL are those things?
<StinkomanFan> Again, I don't think Silent Hill would be as scary if it was like this
<Phase4> ok. f3ar (which is a stupid name) imply's at least some horror, dual wielding automatic pistols is not a thing found in horror (i'm whining, not complaning)
<otakon> I didn't know the INfected showed up in this?
<RaveBrony> What, Randomnerd? THe Vinyl Scratch?
<SkilledSkillet> Zombie ghosts!
<Phase4> Leave this place!
<StinkomanFan> I already made that joke
<Phase4> the joke has been doubled?
<RaveBrony> lol^
<SkilledSkillet> True dat
<StinkomanFan> Rule of three
<StinkomanFan> We can only use it three times
<fillyfillyy> im back
<StinkomanFan> Then it stops being funny
<Phase4> ohai fillyfillyy
<otakon> wb fillyfillyy
<StinkomanFan> Use your last wisely
<SkilledSkillet> Hi filly

<SkilledSkillet> Fear
<Phase4> fillyfillyy: http://youtu.be/a1LkR6dGWns sugestions?
<fillyfillyy> thats what i thought
<Randomnerd> Well, any of the stuff, RaveBrony. I want Hasbro to look at their marketing data and realize our demographic is worth courting.
<LadyCanary> One does not simply slay prince dari, emantrollslayer.
<Dashie_Dashie> gotta use the little colts room
<Dashie_Dashie> brb
<fillyfillyy> 1 sec ill check that vid Phase4

<SkilledSkillet> It wasnt me
<StinkomanFan> Pinkie Pie scared me before
<StinkomanFan> NOW SHE MORTIFIES ME
<MirrorImage> StinkomanFan - don't break a Pinkie Promise and you'll be fine
<RawketLawnchair> . . .The hell?
<Dken2021> ... well that just happened
<LadyCanary> ...INSANITY. That's wut
<StinkomanFan> I just don't like how I can wake up and turn to see Pinkie Pie staring into my eyes from across my room
<StinkomanFan> Just saying
<Phase4> those pinkie images can actualy get scary
<StinkomanFan> And now that I know she can actually HARM me if she wanted does not help
<emantrollslayer> HOLY SHIT...this is really legit: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNgtIrSHack
<MirrorImage> StinkomanFan - that much was true when we learned that pinkie can break the 4th wall
<MirrorImage> if she can appear ANYWHERE, then she can appear within a body cavity
<Yahooz> ...
<MirrorImage> yeah... let those implications sink in
<Dken2021> Wii U eh?
<StinkomanFan> I'd rather not wake up one morning and see a pink hair in my mouth
<Cypresswolf> possible new zelda game already? I hope it turns out better than - well nevermind, its best left forgotten
*Phase4|RecordingTest needs something to do
<StinkomanFan> Try to pull it out and....FOREVER

<Yahooz> amnesia reaction vids always make me smile
<StinkomanFan> Now I own Amnesia, If somepony made a mod that turned the demons into Pinkie Pie...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, Vi played amnesia before, and I'll have to start from the beginning
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh dear...

<otakon> yeah

<Midnight_Tempest> MOAR F5!!!
<SkilledSkillet> Oh F5 you so silly
<Pony_of_War> I routed for the AFC in the pro-bowl game (routing, haven't seen all of it yet), partially because of the San Diego Chargers :)
<Pony_of_War> Paritally because my friend, who is awesome and beautiful, :), likes the Ravens
<StinkomanFan> no seriously my eyes feel like needles are jamming themselves into it
<emantrollslayer> Nittany_Discord: just came out of the closet :D <3
<CupcakeWarrior> Pony_of_War: Which reminds me, its almost the super bowl

*Pony_of_War she's amazing
<LadyCanary> Huh. For some reason Im not lagging.
<Pony_of_War> :)
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> not lagging
<emantrollslayer> LadyCanary: that's cuz god likes you.
<Pony_of_War> Qwepin!
<Dken2021> yay two chat windows
<Dken2021_> yay 2 chat windows
<StinkomanFan> Alright, the Mane six all have...scary charactoristics
<Pony_of_War> CLOPPER!
<CupcakeWarrior> Damn my slow internet
<NullRadix> dangit Phase4! You link me an awesome story, and I read every chapter to find ITS NOT FINISHED YET
<StinkomanFan> RD's sonic Rainboom can break the sound barrier... what else can it break?
<CupcakeWarrior> The color barrier
<Dken2021> also could achieve mach 10 in 2 seconds flat
*Pony_of_War never goes down, except for when I do
<CupcakeWarrior> How fast is mach 10?
<StinkomanFan> Fluttershy is truely a force to be reckoned with once she gets angry
<emantrollslayer> I dont think this game is PG-13
<Pony_of_War> Mach 10 is RD's calculated top spee
<Dken2021> faster than mach 5, which mach 10 doesn't eve nexist
<fillyfillyy> Duh CupcakeWarrior everyone knows mach 10 = 10 machs an hour duhh...
<CupcakeWarrior> Yes, but how many mph?
<SkilledSkillet> A lot
<StinkomanFan> AJ is willing to do things even when she knows she can't possibly do them
<fillyfillyy> 10 machs an hour :P
<Dken2021> lets' say 10x faster than the speed of light
<emantrollslayer> Dken2021: impossible
<CupcakeWarrior> Shouldnt RD disintegrate from that?
<emantrollslayer> it's impossible to go 1.00000000001x the speed of light
<Pony_of_War> Mach 10 exists, it's a calculated numerical speed
<Midnight_Tempest> CupcakeWarrior: 7,680 mph is Mach 10...
<fillyfillyy> what is 1 mach
<fillyfillyy> i mean mach 1
<Shizuka> 13mein team...
<CupcakeWarrior> She shouldnt be alive after that
<emantrollslayer> Shizuka is best zombie killer
<StinkomanFan> You get hit by RD, all of your bones turn into powder.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01F12 = Mach 1.
<fillyfillyy> wow lol
<StinkomanFan> Your organs liquify
<Shizuka> 13^-^
<fillyfillyy> im clicking F12 and im not going mach 1
<Shizuka> 13kirz' fault for hitting the car
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hey, the viewers can vouch for me
<Pony_of_War> If RD can survive being a living thermonuclear explosion, what would it take to injure her?
<CupcakeWarrior> That would suck then
<Dken2021> your team is dying
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I've got SHIT ping
<Midnight_Tempest> :D
<emantrollslayer> Shizuka: I still think you need to teach me the ways of the shizu
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01F12 = Fujita Scale 12.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 god damn zombies teleporting
<StinkomanFan> The last visage you see is a rainbow coming for you
<otakon> dead
<fillyfillyy> Fujita! lol funny word
<otakon> all dead
<CupcakeWarrior> At least you wont feel it...
<otakon> poor guys
<LadyCanary> D: aw.
<StinkomanFan> Not gonna be fun explaining it to the St. at the pearly gates
<otakon> I HATE it when that happens
*Pony_of_War thinks the mods could use my 500+ hours of zombie apocalypse surviving expertise
<Ingwaz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OOlZ__QzzM
<otakon> hi LadyCanary
<Ingwaz> this is actually well done
<Pony_of_War> I practice :D

<Pony_of_War> What the celestia????
<fillyfillyy> this explains everything about how fast RD goes to cause a rainboom http://birdco.deviantart.com/art/Classroom-Follies-4-263927542
<StinkomanFan> I was lucky enough to get a copy that allowed the Baseball Bat add-on
<fillyfillyy> yea i have da baseball bat too
<emantrollslayer> Did I ever tell you about the time my friend Keith...?
<StinkomanFan> Those Gamestop employees don know wht hit 'em
<StinkomanFan> I once walked into a GameStop and tried to by a Fallout 3 add-on pack with a sock full of bottle caps
<StinkomanFan> *buy
<Midnight_Tempest> lolz
<fillyfillyy> lol did they accept?
<SkilledSkillet> I would
<Midnight_Tempest> i would have
<CupcakeWarrior> Whats with all the hate on Gamestop?
<CupcakeWarrior> I love Gamestop
<Dken2021> not a good store tbh
<StinkomanFan> No, but they had a heaty lol
<emantrollslayer> CupcakeWarrior: because they are greedy and not good for the industry
<StinkomanFan> *hearty
<CupcakeWarrior> My Gamestop isnt that bad
<SkilledSkillet> I like gamestop :(
<LadyCanary> One GameStop in my area isn too bad.
<StinkomanFan> >Walk into Barnes And Novell
<StinkomanFan> >No games
<CupcakeWarrior> lol
<Dken2021> they still sell brawl at release price, after 3 years still
<StinkomanFan> F***ING GAMESTOP
<LadyCanary> I had a nice convo with one of the employees about some games.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Welcome to planet Earth, emantrollslayer
<emantrollslayer> Kira_Pony_Yamato: wah?
<LadyCanary> And then the HIPSTER was employed.
<CupcakeWarrior> brb
<StinkomanFan> Humanity are a bunch of greedy jerks, what else is new?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Pretty much every corporation on this planet is greedy...
<Midnight_Tempest> hipsters + gamestop = not buying from you fuqs...
<StinkomanFan> "Oh you're going to buy Guitar Hero, I prefer to play Bass Hero."
<Midnight_Tempest> thats nice... I DIDNT ASK!... i said that once
<Midnight_Tempest> got kicked out of the store
<StinkomanFan> "You've probably never heard of it."
<otakon> and suddenly I'm deaf
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Indeed...
<StinkomanFan> It took me forever to get that Fried Piper acheivement
<fillyfillyy> they had a promotion where if you boght one of 5 new games for $60 you could trade it in for a whole $30 ohh my!
<StinkomanFan> >Go into store with piles of games
<otakon> go for the HEAD!
<otakon> not the CROTCH!
<StinkomanFan> >Leave with $5 instore credit
<otakon> oh
<StinkomanFan> F***ING GAMESTOP
<otakon> Gamestop talk?
<otakon> yeah
<Phase4> lunch turned out to be complicated
<otakon> I liked working there when I ddi
<Phase4> Phase4|RecordingTest: ding!
<StinkomanFan> Enough about that
<Phase4> Phase4|RecordingTest: ding again!
<otakon> but they're trade in prices are ridiculous
<Phase4> Phase4|RecordingTest: ding one last time, need to test lag
<DatPinkiePlot> left4dead?
<Phase4> and done
<DatPinkiePlot> realy?
<Cypresswolf> I hate going to just about any store. They always! have to offer me a bunch of crap at the checkout when all I want to do is make my purchase and get on with my day. I dont need a store card, I dont want their false warrenties, or email spam. Nothing! What happened to a simple Thanks for shopping at X?
<StinkomanFan> How about an official poni game, NOT FIGHTING IS MAGIC]
<DatPinkiePlot> last thing i'd expect
<Phase4|RecordingTest> ^
<Dken2021> don't even think about trading in a third party game, you'll barely get anything back from it
<Phase4|RecordingTest> would be good
<Phase4|RecordingTest> text wall
<Midnight_Tempest> of doom
<Phase4|RecordingTest> eb games, wich is ownd by gamestop funny enough, works like that here
<MirrorImage> Cypresswolf - which is when they ask the first time "do you have our rewards card," if i don't, my response is "no i don't nor am i interested, thank you"
<StinkomanFan> I hate how when I ask for a first party poni game the first thing that comes up is LOLOLOLOLOLFIGHTING IS MAGIKS
<MirrorImage> cuts off the rest of their speech right there
*Kira_Pony_Yamato troll the witch

<Phase4|RecordingTest> hi BEN and Everlasting_Joy
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey Phase4!
*NullRadix tackles Phase4|RecordingTest
<BEN> Hello Phase4
<Everlasting_Joy> Looks at NullRadix oddly
<NullRadix> Why'd you link that Cherilee fic that's not finished? WHY?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Can you see what we type?
<Everlasting_Joy> Yeah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01K.
<NullRadix> Now I have ANOTHER fic I have to watch out for!
<Phase4|RecordingTest> NullRadix: i'm sorry, it was to awesome to not share :'(
<Everlasting_Joy> Oh I hate this part of the game.
<fillyfillyy> gtg everyone
<NullRadix> I even clicked the music links for it
<CupcakeWarrior> Maybe I need to start reading some FiM fanfics...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<NullRadix> I haven't done that for anything before!
<Everlasting_Joy> Night night fillyfillyy.
<Phase4|RecordingTest> later fillyfillyy
<NullRadix> night fillyfillyy
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: I suggest Fallout Equestria
<SkilledSkillet> Nacht Filly
<otakon> night fillyfillyy sleep well
<BEN> Have you met with a terrible fate? Have you done something you shouldn't have done? Well then call the law offices of BEN! He drowned...
<Phase4|RecordingTest> CupcakeWarrior: School Daze, unfinished but its best fic
<NullRadix> um... I'm not sure Fallout Equestria is a "starting fic"
<fillyfillyy> bye Everlastin_Joy Phase4 NullRadix otakon and everyone else
<Phase4|RecordingTest> later
<NullRadix> hold on, i think I have a good starting fic
<otakon> but it's a GREAT fic!
<CupcakeWarrior> I have read some of the more disturbing fics
<otakon> it's over
<Everlasting_Joy> otakon: It isn't MLD is it?
<Phase4|RecordingTest> <<< i just want to point out that this violent game full of blood is streaming on a site were we watch 'my little pony'
<BEN> Reading? You people make me sick...
<NullRadix> Fallout Equestria is a great fic. It's also longer than LOTR
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: then you won't bat an eye at Fallout: Equestria
<Phase4|RecordingTest> i still have to finish fallout
<CupcakeWarrior> How long is Fallout Equestria?
<otakon> Phase4: true, but it's no worse than Halloween 07
<BEN> I dont even read creepypasta!
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: 47 chapters, 2000 pages, 600,000+ words
<NullRadix> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/04/story-sunny-skies-all-day-long.html <-- this is a simple fic, about a half hour read, that's basically an episode
<otakon> but it's GREAT!
<Phase4> CupcakeWarrior: long
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Pfft, that's nothing
<Phase4> very long
<otakon> Kira_Pony_Yamato: name one novel offhand that is longer than 2000 standard pages?
<Phase4> its tl;dr for alot of readers
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Maderfole's Golden Age Trilogy
<Phase4|RecordingTest> man, the videos lagging alot here
<otakon> I said ONE nove
<otakon> ONE
<Everlasting_Joy> Phase4 Yeah, it is for me too.
<otakon> not a TRILOGY
*Fleur is still in the safe house after the tunnel of love
<SkilledSkillet> Well I'm gonna go bye everyone
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> each one is about one million words
<otakon> FO: E is ONE NOVEL
<Randomnerd> Well, publishers always break up books for that reaoson.
<Randomnerd> Bye, SkilledSkillet
<Everlasting_Joy> Fleur for good reasons.
<NullRadix> later SkilledSkillet
<BEN> bye SkilledSkillet
<otakon> see ya SkilledSkillet sleep well
<NullRadix> well, and profitable reasons
<Everlasting_Joy> Night SkilledSkillet.
<NullRadix> but I'm sure "the book is too big" is a good reason too
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> indeed
<BEN> SkilledSKillet: Ill tell the MoonChildren to lay off it for tonight
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Someone startled the witch...
<Phase4> stupid mips.tv
<Randomnerd> You can't sell a 2000 page book! No one will buy it. it's too heavy tolto hold.
<Phase4|RecordingTest> i keep accidentaly closing the stream
<otakon> I would buy it
<NullRadix> Behold the internet! Thousands of pages! No physical weight!
<otakon> yeah
<PartyCannon> Yay L4D2~!
<CupcakeWarrior> I think the dictionary has more than 2000 pages
<otakon> that's why I'm trying to get my e-reader to work right
<NullRadix> Well... unless you count the physical objects behind the internet... but you dont have to carry those
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I wouldn't be surprised
<Phase4> whats the page count of wikipedia?
<Randomnerd> A dictionary serves a speciifc purpose, you don't read it for hours.
<NullRadix> linky-pages or printed pages?
<NullRadix> dont answer, I dont know either way
<Randomnerd> And larger dictionaries are broken up into volumes.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> btb, cat getting into trouble
<CupcakeWarrior> Whats the longest fanfic on ff.net?
<Randomnerd> The OED is 13 books
<CupcakeWarrior> lag
<BEN> Argh, why do you people talk about reading so much? I mean its not like reading does anything for you!
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> ....wow
<CupcakeWarrior> I just dont have very much patience
<NullRadix> point in case, FO:E is long. FO:E-PH might end up being longer (not sure page count wise, but the "halfway point" was 33 supposedly)
<PartyCannon> CupcakeWarrior let me know if you find out, I'm curious as well
<Everlasting_Joy> "So the smoker" *shades "got smoked."
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> *sigh*
<Everlasting_Joy> :$
<Randomnerd> I can think of one novel that's 1000 pages long, and it's not a very well regarded Novel...
<Phase4> NullRadix: the 'down to the wire' thing in school daze, someone needs to sing that
<Phase4> that needs to be made
<Randomnerd> No, wait, three.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> floating zombie...
<NullRadix> .. I could see it... I think the notes were *slightly* off from the text, but I might be wrong
<BEN> Zombies are mean, i mean seriously
<Randomnerd> Atlas Shrugged, Battlefield Earth, and one of the "Wheel of Time" books.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> indeed they are
<Shizuka> 13we are pro team
<Phase4> NullRadix: they were a bit, but still needs to be made
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that lag spike during the horde made me worry
<Randomnerd> Two books that aren't well-liked, and a book that was part of a series so long the author didn't live to finish it.
<NullRadix> Phase4: are you volunteeting?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka's kicking ass
<NullRadix> volunteering*
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> lllaaagggg
<BEN> Play the Sun's Song it stops redeads!
<Shizuka> 13^-^
<Everlasting_Joy> BEN ha!

<Phase4> NullRadix: not realy, i sing like poop

<NullRadix> Hold on, laundry calling
<Phase4> nope, still dropping frames :(
<Everlasting_Joy> I love the clown's "honk" noise.

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Then why are we playing L4D2?!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like L4D2 more.
<Shizuka> 13cause that's what val has :P
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Haha, no way I'm getting that game now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01More varied.
<bluestrom_S> they ported all of l4d1 to l4d2
<PartyCannon> I bought both as a bundle before the L4D1 campaigns got ported
<BEN> Talk about ironic! I love the idea of Bloddy Tears but I hate the idea of someone destroying ghosts, demons, and other monsters!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'll play and stream L4D after you Val if anypony wants to play that.

<otakon> I run into a corner
<BEN> So what is ever"ponies" favorite episode in Season 2 so far?
<PartyCannon> BEN Last Roundup
<CupcakeWarrior> The Last Roundup :P
<otakon> has to be the Cider episode
<BEN> You know I happy for Derpy and Imma let her finish, but Lesson Zero was amazing, people going insane, a time limit, although the end was kinda dull...
<CupcakeWarrior> Was the cider episode supposed to be a parody or something?
<PartyCannon> CupcakeWarrior like a lot of folks, it reminded me of The Music Man and the monorail episode from The Simpsons
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: think the Music Man
<CupcakeWarrior> I have never heard of it :(
<otakon> yeah the song number was inspired by tehe Muscic Man
<otakon> it's a musical
<otakon> that and the Monorail song
<CupcakeWarrior> That is probably why then
<otakon> you never take theater?
<CupcakeWarrior> Nope
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Stupid mod makes the witch emit fire electricity.

<Artemis> nice
<CupcakeWarrior> Ponies > school
<CupcakeWarrior> I should probably be in bed right now
<Placebo> ponies > bodily needs
<BEN> Ponies > Driving people insane
<Cavy> Although, my favorite one at the moment might be May the Best Pet Win, just because of the "Dun dun dun" and the fact that Rainbow Dash whistles to Ride Of The Valkyries
*EmeraldChocolate Loves ponies
*Cavy agrees.
*CupcakeWarrior imagines RD next to self
<Placebo> *doesn't know how to do the italic thingy.
<Cavy> type in /me
*EmeraldChocolate hugs Cavy
<Cavy> and whatever you want.
*Cavy hugs EmeraldChocolate tightly.
*Cavy tries to pick another Pony to watch.
*EmeraldChocolate can't breathe
*Placebo had an ephinay.
*BEN walks to Equstria using his extradimensional travel powers, while smiling mockingly at the rest as if to say "U GELATIN?"
*Cavy releases EmeraldChocolate.
*Placebo can't spell.
*EmeraldChocolate gasps for air
<Cavy> Anyone have a suggestion though?
<Shizuka> 13epiphany?
*Cavy is sorry.
<CupcakeWarrior> Sonic Rainboom
*EmeraldChocolate pats Cavy on back. Alright ther

*BEN can't spell either
<Cavy> I already watched it.
<CupcakeWarrior> yay~
<Cavy> Any others?
<Cavy> Oh, Placebo, are you into Fanfic?
<Placebo> Eeyup
<EmeraldChocolate> ..
<BEN> Cavy: Lesson Zero, it's basically MAjora's MAsk
<Cavy> Read mine?
<Placebo> Link?
<EmeraldChocolate> Chur bro
<Placebo> I'm brutally honest, i'll warn you.
<Cavy> Lesson Zero is great....time to watch...
<Placebo> hiii girlsss.
<Cavy> Damn...Can't take the brutal honesty...
<CupcakeWarrior> :$ HAI GURLZ
<EmeraldChocolate> Placebo me and LadyCanary are basically the only gals in this room
<Cavy> RD is quite a bit OC. And will tend to be, but with good reason of course.
<BEN> Clock is ticking! -Dawn of Final Day- 24 Hours Remain
<Cavy> http://poni.0au.de/story/8854/Broken-Road
<Placebo> EmeraldChocolate: Hellooo nurse.
<EmeraldChocolate> :S
<Placebo> xD
<Placebo> Cavy: I'll definitely give it a read.
*LadyCanary shrugs.
<Cavy> Thanks.
*otakon rolls eyes at Placebo
<Shizuka> 13.-.
<Placebo> Sorry, Ota. Not into that. xP
*Cavy decides whether or not to watch Lesson Zero or sleep.
<EmeraldChocolate> That's beautiful Cavy!
<Cavy> Huh?
<EmeraldChocolate> nvm
<EmeraldChocolate> Lol i'll post it'
<Cavy> >>
<Placebo> 800 words.. gimmme 3 minutes.
<Cavy> Oh, my story? =P
<EmeraldChocolate> Gold runs through my veins. At least that's what they told me. From birth, they would brag, I was destined for greatness. Is it wrong that I doubt that? There are so many ponies that are so fantastic at what they do best, what gained them the privilege to wear that symbol on their flank. I wasn't even close to greatness. I was pathetic.
<EmeraldChocolate> BEAUTIFUL!
<CupcakeWarrior> Suddenly, wall of text
<Cavy> Darkness then Redness then Whiteness.
<EmeraldChocolate> Lollz
<Cavy> I thought it was a good paragraph =P
<Placebo> It's not generally a good idea to have a summary taken straight from the story.
<EmeraldChocolate> :|
<Cavy> First paragraph =(
*BEN raises no objections to the very well written paragraph
<Cavy> Oh god, Placebo is reading my story.
<EmeraldChocolate> :)
<EmeraldChocolate> Oh Noez
<Cavy> Permission to post a video link to describe my emotion?
<Placebo> Cavy: <3
<EmeraldChocolate> It's beautiful.
<Cavy> Actually, everyone go into Rainbow Dash chat.
<Cavy> =P
<otakon> Placebo: I rolled my eyes at you, I wasn't making advances. Besides, I like girls only myself so no worries. Just be careful around Saturn and Wrek, they're fliry.
<Placebo> No u.
<Cavy> My emotion right now-
<Cavy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhMvKv4GX5U&feature=related

<Placebo> I have the bookmarked as a .gif for facebook responses.
<Cavy> With sound?
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh man
<Placebo> otakon: I was just messin, man. Lol.
<EmeraldChocolate> Lolz
<Placebo> Nah, that'd require a flash link or something.
<otakon> eh
<EmeraldChocolate> I want that now :(-
<otakon> I kind of figured
<EmeraldChocolate> :-(~
<Cavy> Emerald, you're reading?
<Cavy> =P
<Placebo> Ugh. Darn My english professor and his imphasis on critical reading.

<Cavy> I enjoy it quite a bit.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:>
<Placebo> I do, too. Between fanfics and books, I spend probably 4 hours a day in it, if I have the time.
*BEN does not understand the human infatuation with words...
<Cavy> I'm writing my next chapter tomorrow.
<EmeraldChocolate> Well by that paragraph what I know is that I <3 your writing
<Cavy> Forgot why.
<CupcakeWarrior> Is it okay that I enjoy the shipping fics?
<Cavy> Thanks Emerald <3
<EmeraldChocolate> :)
<Shizuka> 13pff
<Shizuka> 13ponies
<Cavy> Now, job to do. Watch Lesson 0
*Placebo is a chat noob

<SuperBrony64> 10,02YOU'RE RIGHT
<CupcakeWarrior> I would eat a chimicherry anyday of the week
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Chimmycherry sounds like a drink of some sort.
*Placebo is going to patent chimmycherry soft drinks.
<LadyCanary> Fund it?
<Cavy> Guys, you get banned if you dont talk in All caps in #Allcaps

<Ingwaz> i need to make a chimicherrychanga sometime
*Shizuka 13curls up by the fireplace und pulls the covers over sleepy vivi~
<Ingwaz> apparently a bunch of bronies tried it after the ep and the results worked quite well
<SuperBrony64> 10,021. Take Chimichanga recipe 2. Add tons of cherries in it 3. Deep fry it ^_^
*Cavy waits for Steven_Magnet to return in 3 years.
<valoreins> deepfrying a cherry sounds... unnatural to me..
<LadyCanary> ...So hungry.
<CupcakeWarrior> Lets not talk about food
<PartyCannon> I tried it, and approve of it :)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm hungry right now...
<Cavy> Guys, Mods are asleep.

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Orly?

<Placebo> Haha. Benefits of working at subway. SAMMICHES.
*Placebo nomnomnom
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Nope, never saw anything on TV or in the Movies related to Transformer ^_^
<Shizuka> 13lucky
<CupcakeWarrior> Transformers 3 was pretty awesome
<Placebo> Meh.
<Cavy> SuperBrony64, it seems that MLP FiM is the rival show of Transformers.
<CupcakeWarrior> Not really
<Cavy> So, thats why I said that.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Transformers is bad and it should feel bad.
<Shizuka> 13^
<Placebo> Eeyup.
<Shizuka> 13beast wars was good though
<valoreins> good graphic, bad story
<Cavy> Wait...
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But the funniest thing I saw online was...
<Shizuka> 13cause Mainframe knew how to handle it, they did more storytelling than toy selling
<Cavy> Has everyone seen Rainbow Dash vs Star Scream?
<CupcakeWarrior> Mlp is the only time I watch the Hub
<Placebo> Eeyup
<Cavy> Spoiler Alert: Dash wins.
<Placebo> Had top comment on it for like, 2 weeks. xD

<Placebo> ugh.
<valoreins> oh good god *cans.wav*
<Cavy> <Sad Pony.
<Apple> Hi
<Cavy> I liked Rainbow Factory. As it was written, any way. Not the plot, really.
<Cavy> Sweet Apple....God..
<Placebo> I've read about half of Rainbow Factory.
<Cavy> In my eyes, thats just as bad as the Fiction we can't talk about.
<Placebo> The writing is very good. I just.. was afraid to go further.
<TOY_PON3> hey guys :)
<Cavy> Yea. The ending is kinda of upsetting.
<CupcakeWarrior> Sweet Apple Massacre was funny to me until I saw a CMC themed episode
<Placebo> Howdy TOY_PON3
<valoreins> MLD should be an example for good fanfic
<Cavy> Exactly CupcakeWarrior.
<Placebo> From what I've heard about sweet apple Massacre, I have no interest in it.
<TOY_PON3> CupcakeWarrior: Just no...
<TOY_PON3> hey Cavy
<CupcakeWarrior> I feel bad now
<Cavy> Except to me, it was never funny.
<Cavy> Hey TOY_PON3.

<TOY_PON3> It's just sick and it's okay CupcakeWarrior
<Cavy> My fiction is interesting.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02This better not be discussion of Gore fanfictions.
<Placebo> Nope

<SuperBrony64> Ohai :3
<Placebo> Placebo: I guess I'd have to go with the one I've spent the most time on, Fallout Equestria.
<Placebo> LMAO

*Arentius joins the ponypile on SuperBrony64
*SuperBrony64 is glomped O_O
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol
*Placebo is confused.
<TOY_PON3> Scootaloo is best fried chicken
*kirzstryfe noms SuperBrony64's mane
*Arentius noms SuperBrony64's ears
<Cavy> if she did she probably woulnt want to because Spiek would see her as a spider and maybe get scared or angry and then stomp all ove r her which would make her dead spider twilight abd that is bad.
<Placebo> Cavy: RD chatroom for fic cdiscussion
*SuperBrony64 is being nommed ;____;
<Placebo> Ugh
<Placebo> DAT FIC.
<Cavy> Excerp of Spiderses

*Arentius pins the broomstick and keeps nomming SuperBrony64 while fighting back with an umbrella
<Placebo> So, yeah, Fallout Equestria is amazing, but you have to really get into it.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hell yeah it is
<TOY_PON3> CupcakeWarrior: I agree
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Scootaloo needs more party time
<TOY_PON3> :3
<Placebo> Mainly because it's set in the future, and revolves around OCs.
<Midnight_Tempest> zombies FOREEVVVVEEERRRR!!! *nomnomnomnom*
<SuperBrony64> 10,02My wife just called me.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02She said, "The two kids want you to take them Bowling on Saturday, then afterwards they want you to take them to the cinema."
<SuperBrony64> 10,02"It's either one or the other," I said, "otherwise it's too expensive."
<SuperBrony64> 10,02"Okay," she replied. "Which one do you prefer?"
<CupcakeWarrior> Someone should stream it
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I said, "David."
<Midnight_Tempest> O.o
<Placebo> But, dear God, it gets so good when you get into it.
<Midnight_Tempest> suddenly text
<TOY_PON3> *rimshot*?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hehe
<Placebo> and at 500,000 words, It took me around 50 hours to read.

<SuperBrony64> 10,02I felt like a fool when I bought Amy Winehouse tickets for my daughter and then remembered that she died last year.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Even more so when I remembered that Amy Winehouse died too.

<Cavy> I'd rather it be centrally about her. You can do anythint with Dash, to be honest.
<Cavy> anything, rather.
<Midnight_Tempest> :D
<Placebo> wait, wait. Are you asking for ideas about writing one?
<TOY_PON3> Amy Winehouse died when...yeah i don't even remember
<Cavy> No.
<Placebo> I thought you wanted a link to a story about her?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02"So, how's life in North Korea?"
<SuperBrony64> 10,02"Well, I can't complain."
<Cavy> I've got that under control.
<Cavy> I want a story to read.

<Placebo> Got cha, got cha.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3morning Wrek :)
<TOY_PON3> Hi Wrek
<Placebo> Um, first off: Shipping bother you?
<Cavy> Although, if you want to talk ideas, I'm game.
<Fleur> Wrek! omgomgomgomgomg!
<Wrek> 05hia guise
<Cavy> A bit. It depends.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02How school works:
<SuperBrony64> 10,02In class: 2+2=4.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Homework: 2+4+2=8.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Exam: John had 4 apples. He eats one and gives one to a friend. Calculate the Sun's mass.
<Cavy> Not fond of Cloppyness.
<Placebo> I'm having issues enough with my fiction, man. Plus a super-secret movie thing coming that I can't talk about
<CupcakeWarrior> lol
<Placebo> oh hell no.
<CupcakeWarrior> :D
<Placebo> Nothing like that >_<
<Wrek> 05hey SB
<Cavy> Gotcha.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Ohai :3
<Cavy> Yea, Shipping is OK..
<Wrek> 05the NT of my maths class is in 3 weeks
<TOY_PON3> dammit SuperBrony64 I don't know math jokes :(
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:O

<SuperBrony64> 10,02K
<Arentius> SUP WREK!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02What's 2+2=?

<TOY_PON3> dat ohsit
<Fleur> suns mass is equal to the remaining apples ^100000000000000 x fruit bats
<kirzstryfe> 1,3damnit, script killed my number
<Cavy> Just, I don't like it when Dash gets shipped with girls to be honest. Not that I'm anti gay or anything. It just seems to be an assumption that her mane indicates that she is a Lesbian.
<Placebo> Let's see... Equestria: Total war is great so far... Not RD centric, though. Kinda features everypony
<Cavy> When, based on the newest episode, she's not.
<valoreins> the answer is 42
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hint, it's less than 5 but greater than 3
<Placebo> I don't mind it if it's pulled off well..
<kirzstryfe> 1,32+2=5 for very large quantities of 2
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O___O
<kirzstryfe> 1,3*2+2
*SuperBrony64 glomps kirzstryfe
<Placebo> Hurrhurr Appledash annoys me, though
<Cavy> If you can make it realistic, go for it.

*TOY_PON3 brain hurts
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:>
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:-
<TOY_PON3> :3
<Midnight_Tempest> 	A hole has been found in the nudist camp wall. The police are looking into it.
<Cavy> To be honest, you might have to force your character to OC to ship.
*SuperBrony64 tackle-glomps kirzstryfe
<Midnight_Tempest> <_< >_>
<kirzstryfe> 1,3eye now math und engrish grammuh
<Cavy> I don't mind shipping if it goes from the character being themself to them getting to that point.
<Arentius> mfw Kirz gets 2 glomps and SB neglects me
<kirzstryfe> 1,3my glomps :p
<Wrek> 05the area between 2 curves, in the section of 5S10 when the following function is 3x dx
*SuperBrony64 tackle-glomps Arentius
<Arentius> it's fine
<Placebo> agreed.
<Arentius> I'm used to SB neglecting me
<Arentius> he always does
*kirzstryfe tackle-glomps the glomp
<Cavy> I don't like it when the character is different from canon, which, in my first chapter, Dash is. However, I'm planning on letting her come out a bit more for a while.
<TOY_PON3> poor Arentius
<Cavy> Let Dashie be Dashie.
*SuperBrony64 hugs Arentius tightly
<Arentius> he claims to wub me but He doesn't really :< I only get hugs when I complain :P
<Placebo> Well, you also have the "willing suspension of disbelief" going.
<Cavy> Then again, who says Rainbow Dash is thinking what she's saying and doing?
<Placebo> You have Dash before we see her in the show.
<Cavy> Exactly.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3isn't that what family's for though?
*Midnight_Tempest curls into a ball in the corner and yawns
<valoreins> wub? *wubwubwubwubwubwub*
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Wrek: I can help you with that, but Section of 5S10?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3to hug you when you start to bitch too much? ^_^
<Placebo> As long as she acts as she's portrayed by she reaches age X, you're in line.
<Arentius> ouch kirz...just ouch
<TOY_PON3> o-o
<Placebo> It's your discretion as an author to make up how she gets there.
*kirzstryfe hugs Arentius
<Arentius> just for that imma go play a game on easy and imagine all the enemies are you >.>
<Cavy> Right.
<Wrek> 05its the interval
<djdashie> hi

<Cavy> =(
<Wrek> 05but irc doesnt allow fancy signs
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Oh, so from 5 - 10?
*TOY_PON3 hugs Midnight_Tempest
<Cavy> Hiya djdashie.

<SuperBrony64> 10,02What's the second curve function?
<djdashie> hi all
<CupcakeWarrior> No more math!
<djdashie> hay sb64
<valoreins> no math, yes meth!
<TOY_PON3> Math is Magic
<Placebo> Into my fic? Honestly, it's not very far along, and I'm still piecing the backstory together, so it at least makes sense.
<Wrek> 05iirc it was along the lines of 2xcos4
<Placebo> djdashie: Howdy!
<Midnight_Tempest> What do you have when a lawyer is buried up to his neck in sand?
*CupcakeWarrior cowers in fear
<djdashie> howdy
*Arentius hugs kirzstryfe and SuperBrony64 with umbrellas
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Well, first you need to graph the two together to see which is higher than the other.
<Midnight_Tempest> Not enough sand.
<Cavy> Perhaps I can help?
<Cavy> =/
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Then whichever is higher, you solve the integral of both from 5 to 10 and subtract the lower integral answer from the higher integral answer.
<Placebo> Don't use yer fancy math-uh-matics to confound the issue.
<Cavy> We could pop open, in the words of the 4chanistas...
<TOY_PON3> Why did the Scootaloo cross the road?
<Cavy> Dat Private chat
<Placebo> To escape the Colonel?
<Midnight_Tempest> this... this must be... CALCULUS!!! *explodes*
<Placebo> Your call. I'd hate to sound like an idiot. xD

<Cavy> <.>
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yeah?
<Placebo> Honestly, between school, military, work, helping on another project, and it, it just isn't seeing the time it needs.
<Midnight_Tempest> calculus is EXTREMELY advanced math
<Saturn> 8,1the thought of differential calculus warms my toes in bed at night
<TOY_PON3> No seriously why did Scootaloo cross the road.
<TOY_PON3> :P
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Calculus is the math of change.
<valoreins> what's uncouth?
<Wrek> 05how the fuck do i take out the f`` of f(x)=4x -cos^2
<Cavy> Military?
<Midnight_Tempest> o.o
<Saturn> 8,1Midnight_Tempest: can't tell if joking or not
<djdashie> lol
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You take the derivative of the derivative.
<Placebo> I'm a Cadet.
<Wrek> 05righto
<kirzstryfe> 1,3can you do that?
<Placebo> It puts the deviation on its skin..
<Midnight_Tempest> lol Saturn, unintentional joke
<kirzstryfe> 1,3can you derivitate twice?
<Saturn> 8,1Wrek: easy, just take the two terms seperately and apply chain rule to the latter
<TOY_PON3> Bronystate is best site for learning :3
<Cavy> Ah.
<Saturn> 8,1then do it again
<CupcakeWarrior> Thank Celestia im only in algebra 2
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yup, the second derivative of 4x becomes 0.

<TOY_PON3> Wrek: US schooling is very complicated
<Saturn> 8,1that's basically biology, but with *useful* maths, right?
<Midnight_Tempest> SB... you better make nanomachines that make us all powerful, and the bronies need to get it first
<Wrek> 05we just call it math D
<Wrek> 05math A to E
<TOY_PON3> seems much more simplier
<Wrek> 05et
<Wrek> 05c
<Wrek> 05for isntance currently reading eng C
<Wrek> 05which is the highest available language course
<TOY_PON3> Wrek: Nice
<SuperBrony64> 10,02It's basically the combination of a background in engineering techniques while specializing in biological applications.
<Midnight_Tempest> nanomachines
<SuperBrony64> 10,02^
<valoreins> but i thought school in US is fun... i saw this teen thing on disney channel, they all do is singing and dancing
<TOY_PON3> Yup, being a junior in high school sucks.
<Wrek> 05anyways
<Wrek> 05i begin in 50 minutes
<Midnight_Tempest> valoreins: not sure if serious or sarcasm...
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Tissue engineering is an excellent aspect of a bioengineer.
<TOY_PON3> okie doki loki
<Wrek> 05then i have math for 20 minutes
<Wrek> 0530*
<Saturn> 8,1hey Wrek, i just remembered, you can do your problem really easily using the product rule
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Good luck Wrek!
<sirwilliam> i did sing back in high school...
<Wrek> 05then I can go home
<Wrek> 05cause i have no morel essons for the day :D
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yup, break up the function to be -[cos(x) * cos(x)]
<Midnight_Tempest> school is nothing like Glee... stupid effing show
<TOY_PON3> You know..I wish Twilight Sparkle could be my tutor :(
<valoreins> lol
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<Wrek> 05sin/cos/sin/cos
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Product rule is f'(x)g(x)+g'(x)f(x)
<Wrek> 05they jsut switch dont they?
<TOY_PON3> Why can't Ponies tutor us and help us in school?!
*TOY_PON3 cries
<Wrek> 05when you deriviate them?
<Midnight_Tempest> oh god... the maths... IT BURNS
<valoreins> iknowthatfeelbro.jpg
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Sin > Cos > -Sin > -cos >
<otakon> omg
<CupcakeWarrior> Math=:P
<otakon> math
<TOY_PON3> Midnight_Tempest: Don't look at it
<valoreins> meth
<SuperBrony64> 10,02In derivative order
<otakon> I haven't seen math in YEARS
<Wrek> 05then it just loops?
<Midnight_Tempest> save yourself otakon... RUN!
<TOY_PON3> otakon: Really?
<otakon> no
<otakon> I must LEARN again
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yup
<CupcakeWarrior> Learning is Magic
<otakon> yeah, I haven't done major math in years
*Wrek takes a note
<valoreins> learn like twilight sparkle
<sirwilliam> l/me switches to maths function on his calculator
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Going from cos to sin while doing the derivative inverses the sign
<TOY_PON3> Everyday I'm studying!
<Midnight_Tempest> ._. my mind just went blank...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Night.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Night Nittany_Discord!
<valoreins> math? yaoming.jpg
<TOY_PON3> Night Nittany_Discord
*Phase4 is back
<CupcakeWarrior> Goodnight Nittany
<Phase4> hello, good night Nittany_Discord
<TOY_PON3> welcome back Phase4
<Saturn> 8,1(f * g)` = f` * g + g` * f <-- product rule
<Saturn> 8,1iirc
<SuperBrony64> 10,02What I said silly :3
<TOY_PON3> brb gonna go get ready for bed :D
<Wrek> 05whats g?
<Phase4> so whats ` meen'
<SuperBrony64> 10,02g is your second function
<Saturn> 8,1i meant to type that in like 3 minutes ago
<RawketLawnchair> http://i42.tinypic.com/imi3jm.png NMM is a happy pony.
<Saturn> 8,1but i had to blow my nose
<Wrek> 05i think we're using a different symbol for that but hmm
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Basically: if h(x)=f(g(x)) then h'(x) = f'(x)g(x)+g'(x)f(x)
<Wrek> 05FUCK THIS IM AN ARTIST, i shouldnt have to deal with this >.>
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O U
<Saturn> 8,1all that means is that if you take the derivative of the product of two functions, you can apply that rule
<Placebo> Suddenly Trig doesn't seem so bad.
<Phase4> "i'm an english major, you do the math"
<valoreins> @Wrek i know that feel bro
<RawketLawnchair> I don't know anything about them ' s there.
<Saturn> 8,1i really don't understand this: do people *honestly* find trig hard?
<Wrek> 05you know what the worst part is?
<Saturn> 8,1like, seriously?
<RawketLawnchair> I just started learning about f(g(x))
<Wrek> 05i have to translate the terms they use, and guess where they go
<Placebo> ^ Nope. But it isn't fun, either.
<valoreins> anyone wanna let me draw the humanized version of this scene? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DdsEjfCbzk
<CupcakeWarrior> Ive never been to trig
<Phase4> never found trig hard, school didnt go past right angle triangles though
<Saturn> 8,1Placebo: i think trig is fun...
<Placebo> valoreins: For the love of God, at least use some censors or something.
<Phase4> i found out about the general ... something (cant remember the name) on my own
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Trig should go die in a fire.
<Placebo> Saturn: Really? It gets to repetitive to me =s
<Cavy> "--guys, what if--what if the DRAGONS had a COUNTRY and they were invading the ZEBRAS and then we were helping them out, I mean the zebras 'cause they have hooves too, and then what if the gryphons helped out the dragons 'cause they have wings and OH MY GOSH--"
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Trig identities are the WORST thing ever in math.
<Cavy> -Pinkie Pie
<Phase4> SuperBrony64: so ' is "take the derivative of"?
<otakon> actually
<RawketLawnchair> Cavy, that's stupid. You're stupid!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'd love to see a 'take the derivative of' for a function...but not if it involves trig identities
<Midnight_Tempest> please... no more math... please...
<Placebo> imma pilot, dun need ur silly mathmaticz
<SuperBrony64> 10,02ANYWAY
<otakon> trig is WAY beyond me atm
<Wrek> 05oh and SB
<Wrek> 05i failed math C
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Stream will be up in a minute
<Wrek> 05on the point
<otakon> goodie
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Sorry to hear that Wrek :(
<CupcakeWarrior> Thank god
<otakon> but it's 2 am here
<Wrek> 05I TRIPPEDO N 1 friggin POINT
<otakon> brb
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:O
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it's been about 5 years since I've done calc >.<
<SuperBrony64> 10,02How is that going to affect your graduation?
<Wrek> 05though i got a B on math A and B
<otakon> hiya kirzstryfe
<Placebo> So, what I've established tonight... SuperBrony64 +50 respects for being match whiz.
<Phase4> i would have done better at math, except my high school confused 'math' with 'graphing'
<otakon> gods, I feel like a idiot
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hehe
<Midnight_Tempest> i am an idiot...
*Presea slaps a large trout around a bit with Artemis.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02i liek math...to an extent
<otakon> stupid MATH
<Saturn> 8,1hey now, graphing is important
<Midnight_Tempest> this didnt make any sense to me...
<Wrek> 05unless i comp the NT for C
<Wrek> 05nothign changes
<valoreins> brb, my mom's gonna use the PC now..
<Saturn> 8,1i *love* maths, but then if i didn't, i wouldn't be studying computer science
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Don't worry Wrek, I'll make sure you pass your test.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3SB, now you have to play something completely innane on stream to make everypony feel better
<Phase4> Saturn: it is extremely important, but parabolas only have to be graphed ONCE to see what they look like
<SuperBrony64> 10,02okay :3
<Midnight_Tempest> i havent been in school for a decade... i dont remember anything anymore
<Phase4> not 20 times per class
<Wrek> 05cause C isnt counted and obligatory clearance
<Wrek> 05math B is though
<Wrek> 05current problem is chemistry
<Wrek> 05now that i also failed
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Chemistry is ALWAYS a problem
<Wrek> 05but
<SuperBrony64> 10,02FUCK ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
<Wrek> 05its coutned as obligatory clearance
<CupcakeWarrior> Is chemistry hard?
<Wrek> 05so without it
<Wrek> 05im fucked
<Placebo> CupcakeWarrior: are you in highschool? Or college?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02What are you going to do then?
<CupcakeWarrior> High school
<Wrek> 05take the comp next month and pray
<Wrek> 05(to satan)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Which you need my help to study, right?
<Wrek> 05mhmmm
<Saturn> 8,1i'm ashamed to say that i know little chemistry and hardly any biology
<Wrek> 05there are only 3 more comp opportunities this term
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm cool with Biology, but Chemistry is a damn nightmare
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Organic Chemistry: Synthesis and Mechanisms is one of the hardest classes I have ever taken.
<Placebo> CupcakeWarrior: Highschool Chemistry isn't anything to worry about. Periodic table, nuff said.
<Saturn> 8,1i studied chemistry to Standard Grade (equivalent of GCSE) at school
<Wrek> 05and its my last term of 12th grade
<Saturn> 8,1but didn't do any biology
<Wrek> 05yey
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Wrek, you can count on me to help you pass this test ^_^
<Phase4> http://www.sosmath.com/ this looks neat
<Wrek> 05now if i dotn dash right this second
<Wrek> 05I wont be able to buy smokes before i take the bus
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Alright, later then :P
<Wrek> 05so ill see ya all after math
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Later!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3good luck
<Saturn> 8,1Wrek: and if that doesn't work, come see me ;)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Phase4: That site looks like garbage
<Phase4> it LOOKS like garbage, content seems good though
<SuperBrony64> 10,02If there's one site in the world that will save your ass in any class
<SuperBrony64> 10,02That's Cramster
<Wrek> 05oh look what a simple site

<Wrek> 05:|
<kirzstryfe> 1,3go to class Wrek :p
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Look, only $19.95 for S.O.S. Math on CD!
<Wrek> 05my webdesign teacher would cry
<Wrek> 05also speaking of crying
<Wrek> 05SB
<Wrek> 05imagine a math teacher
<Wrek> 05cryign sinus curves
<Saturn> 8,1no, no.
<Phase4> i head a ding but no-one dinged me
<kirzstryfe> 1,3ding

<CupcakeWarrior> derpys eyes are so cute
<MahBoi777> NOT THE DUKE
<Dken2021> it's the duke!
<Midnight_Tempest> oh no... Duke Nukem Forever... dumb game but so fun to play
<CupcakeWarrior> Not this game...
<otakon> omg
<CupcakeWarrior> I heard it sucked
<MahBoi777> It does
<Midnight_Tempest> it does
<otakon> ye gods WHY?
<MahBoi777> horribly
<Phase4> Ladies and Gentlemen: Duke Nukem Forever: 12 years of dev and it sucks
<Placebo> LOL
<Placebo> I went to the midnight launch of this.
<otakon> Phase4: not suprising
<Dken2021> this game has people either loving it or hating it
<Midnight_Tempest> but that makes it so fun to play, cause its so 1990's
<otakon> Placebo: you have my pity
<KetaminaDianePie> :O?
<Phase4> the damned game was in development longer than the consoles it runs on combined were
<Phase4> were combined'
<Placebo> You fool. You run them over with your car!
<MahBoi777> they had seven years and they still failed
<MahBoi777> I am dissapoint
<Phase4> MahBoi777: 12
<Phase4> they had 12 years
<MahBoi777> thank you
<Placebo> Use the boost to get through!
<MahBoi777> 12 years
<MahBoi777> NO EXCUSES
<Dken2021> I guess people got so much used to modern day FPSs they forgot what it was like to play a 90s FPS
<Midnight_Tempest> they didnt change anything during that time, they didnt want to... it was meant to be a throwback to the old FPS games of the 90's
<Placebo> SB's driving skills leave something to be desired..
<MahBoi777> BEST DRIVING EVAR
<Placebo> Pro tip: crouch
<Phase4> Midnight_Tempest: except this isnt a 90's shooter
<Phase4> dafaq?
<Midnight_Tempest> Phase4: no, but it was meant to be...
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So yeah, this is OnLive everypony ^_^
<Phase4> his voice is funny
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Cloud gaming :D
<Jim> ohai everypony
<Midnight_Tempest> onlive sucks!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:<
<Phase4> ohai Jim
<Ingwaz> i am beginning to suspect that mlp:fim's songs are nonpareil
<Placebo> i haven't tried it yet.
<Midnight_Tempest> steam is better
<Dken2021> don't be s bashful, at least it's not taking up your HDD
<MahBoi777> 4th wall!
<Jim> can't watch stream at the moment, I'm on a too crappy internet :P
<CupcakeWarrior> Goodnight guys
<Phase4> i would not pay for onlive, but they offer free demos
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But all the games are stored in the cloud and none of the content is running locally so I can have the worst computer ever to be able to play all of these games still
<Dken2021> night CupcakeWarrior
<Placebo> Jim: you're missing out on some good ol' duke.
<Phase4> later CupcakeWarrior
<MahBoi777> cupcakes...
<Jim> Oo, duke
<SuperBrony64> 10,02The other cool thing
<Jim> and g'night cupcake
<Boodfire> onlive looks good, but the imputlag is horrible where i live
<Placebo> So, you like have it for the 360, but are able to play remotely?
<Midnight_Tempest> i know SB, but my computer is good enough to play most of these games so i dont need onlive
<Midnight_Tempest> it doesnt work like that
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Is if you have an OnLive account, you can watch me play live as well :3
<Midnight_Tempest> its PC to PC
<MahBoi777> smokin a cigar, LIKE A BAWS
<Dken2021> you could do that?
<Midnight_Tempest> wait... can i interact with your game too SuperBrony64?
<Placebo> Midnight_Tempest: Oh. So like, if I had a desktop at home, I can play it on my laptop at the airport type thing?
<Midnight_Tempest> yeah, thats very similar
<Placebo> Great. Who wants to buy ol' placebo a desktop?
<MahBoi777> Run towards the flame! LET THE LIGHT GUIDE YOU!
<Phase4> onlive is the videogame is running somewhere else ("in the cloud") and the video is sent to you
<Midnight_Tempest> cloud gaming lets people who have not so decent computers play games that would otherwise kill those computers
<Placebo> Got ya..
<SuperBrony64> 10,02All of the game content is played on the cloud so you don't need to upgrade your GPU to play the high end games. Plus it doesn't store any content locally.
<Placebo> Sounds legit.
<MahBoi777> it's so beautiful
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But yeah, if you watch me, it'll show you as spectacing me and you can rate me with Cheers and Jeers while I play
<SuperBrony64> 10,02OnLive is free to use :3
<Phase4> i want the demo's but there's no australian servers. it doesnt just let me play with lag, it actualy stops me
*Placebo used Jeer!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Name is Coolmatt49 in case you want to add me as a friend :3
<MahBoi777> AMERICA! F*** YEA!
*Placebo it's super effective!
<Phase4> just says NOPE, no games for you
<Placebo> I'm not a big PC gamer, sadly. Laptop is nice, but can't handle some games.
<Dken2021> that great and all, but I want to do all of that PC building at least once in my life
<MahBoi777> hmmmm, chocolate milk
<Phase4> when i have the money for videogames i will have a machine powerfull enough for them anyway
<MahBoi777> ya gotta jump maaaaan
<Placebo> Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free

<Ingwaz> supposedly extremely extensive lore
<Phase4> why doesnt the doctor have a remote controll for the tardis?
<MahBoi777> Oh the gambling

<Placebo> SuperBrony64: Gambling your life's savings away..

<Phase4> i tend to use openbox because it happens to be installed on my machine
<Roxsnow> I like the name : 3
<Placebo> I really like your.... name?
<Phase4> saturn`: no, it just worked for me
<MahBoi777> LOL
<saturn`> ah, okay
<MahBoi777> GADOOSH
<saturn`> for me, whenever i had fast video updates (i.e., whenever i was on the stream), it wouldn't process my inputs
<saturn`> but it seems to be working with that switch
<Phase4> well mine lags anyway
<saturn`> anyhoos, time to test my recording!
<valoreins> SB64 imma watch your DA :D
<MahBoi777> placebo? u awake?
<Placebo> Nnope
<Saturn> 8,1yay, comes out smooth as anything
<MahBoi777> ah, very good, proceed
<Phase4> i seem to have caused all the linux brony's to start recording the stream
<Saturn> 8,1got it recording at 25 fps from xvfb
<Saturn> 8,115 was the maximum from compiz
<Saturn> 8,1*15
<Phase4> Saturn: alot faster than from xorg, just memory maps it
<KetaminaDianePie> O.O
<Davie_Jones> Do you think a unicorn could use a cane? Like as an actual way to support themselves as they walk?
<KetaminaDianePie> my eyes....
<Roxsnow> yeah... I think I'll be sleeping now =w=
<Roxsnow> so good night everyone : 3
<Davie_Jones> I was pondering it, yet I can't feel completely sure about it.
<Placebo> But..
<KetaminaDianePie> niiiiighty niiight
<Dken2021> night Roxsnow
<Placebo> Livestream > bodily functions
<Phase4> Saturn: so you going to be recording as well this episode?
*Roxsnow hugs everyone <3
<Placebo> Roxsnow: Sleep tight!
<Saturn> 8,1Phase4: hell, xvfb draws the actual stream faster than compiz
*Phase4 calls dibs on #BronyState
<MahBoi777> goodnight!
<Dken2021> I think bodily functioms are more imortant than stream
<Saturn> 8,1i.e. the stream is a lot smoother in my recording than it is to actually watch
<MahBoi777> LOL
<MahBoi777> no kiddin
*Davie_Jones waves his cane around to get attention
<Phase4> Saturn: yeah, noticed that. but compiz is cool
<Saturn> 8,1aye
<MahBoi777> hey Davie
<Saturn> 8,1i use it instead of xfwm
<Saturn> 8,1it look preeetty
<Davie_Jones> I am thinking about my ponysona having a cane, yet I am not completely sure that a unicorn could use a cane as it was intended.
<Phase4> and the multiple desktops make me fell sorry for windows users
<Placebo> Mmagic
<MahBoi777> Oh man, I'd best be hittin the ol dusty trail, goodnight all!
<Wrek> 05btw my goal atm it to reach the level acme station
<Wrek> 05then im calling it draw time
<Phase4> gnight Mah Boi
<Wrek> 05mainly becasue that level is very atmospheric
<KetaminaDianePie> NIIIIGHT!
<Placebo> I doubt I'm going to make it that far in T_T
<Davie_Jones> Well I know he'd move it useing magic, yet a cane works by putting your weight on it in lue of your leg. Can you still put weight on it with magic?
<Placebo> Of course. It's magic.
<Placebo> gotta use your Imaginaaation
<Placebo> *rainbow*
<Davie_Jones> Well.. I guess it'd be telepathy in reverse.
<Phase4> isnt telepaty implicitly two way?
<Davie_Jones> No
<Davie_Jones> Normally, you would lift an object using your mind or magic with yourself as a focal point.
<Davie_Jones> In reverse, you would lift yourself using another point as a focal point.
<Phase4> thats telekenesis
<Phase4> telepathy is talking with your mind
<Placebo> ^
<Davie_Jones> Right, thanks.
<Davie_Jones> It's basicly what the baby unicorn did in Pinky Pie's episode.
<Placebo> Walk through walls?
<Placebo> lOl
<Davie_Jones> She made herself fly
<Davie_Jones> using the ground as a focal point.
<Phase4> Pumpkin cake could Phase :P
<Placebo> Ah. That's been fannon since Fo:E, if not before.
<Davie_Jones> Of course that was during her first surge, so I don't believe she could do it again
<Phase4> in fo:e self levitation takes alot of effort for some reason
<Davie_Jones> FO:E?

<Davie_Jones> It is the same princible as a pully. It takes more effert to lift yourself on a pully than it does to lift something else with similar weight.
<Placebo> Phase4: check that?
<Davie_Jones> And I base that on absolutly nothing.
<Phase4> 608026 words

<Starflash> Oh, thank god, I don't know it.
<Starflash> Pass the brain bleach please
<KetaminaDianePie> this looks fuckn awesome
<KetaminaDianePie> i just played standard Doom..... MAAAANY TIMES
<Phase4> Starflash: its on in 8 minutes, i could attempt a stream?
<Starflash> Sure.
<Starflash> It won't be WMC'd, I think...
<Starflash> But some people would vote for it because of the sheer weirdness
<Phase4> ok... i dont have an antena and someone's using the tv
<Phase4> must get a roof antena at some point
<Starflash> +Wrek. XD
<Phase4> do have a usb tuner though
<KetaminaDianePie> btw....... y u cant move sideways........ i remeber i did it in first Doom
<emangamer> Ohai :3
<Starflash> Phase4 MFW that movie comes from my country...
<Dken2021> hello there eman
<KetaminaDianePie> hi emangamer
<Starflash> Ohai emangamer ~
<emangamer> hello Wrek <3
<Nyria> Oh hey emangamer +~
<Nyria> I mean r~*
<Starflash> Dat tildetypo@
<emangamer> fluttershy is most remixed pony
<emangamer> so, apparently a couple of people got really pissed about derpy or something and now last roundup if off of itunes or something
<Starflash> Sheesh
<Starflash> about the little woops-its-a-girl-after-all, emangamer?
<Dken2021> probably those itune comments
<emangamer> Starflash: no about just derpy in general
<emangamer> anti-derpy people
<Starflash> -_-
<Phase4> Starflash: wow, your country is wierd
<emangamer> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/01/addendum-to-derpy-hooves.html
<valoreins> those people do exist?
<Phase4> hi emangamer
<emangamer> hey Phase4
<Starflash> Phase4 yeah
<Davie_Jones> Oooohh boy
<Starflash> we're rumored to have no sense of humor at all XD
<Davie_Jones> This is interesting. So I'm talking to an alien in the Pony RP server
<Starflash> Fortunately, that's just part of the people
<emangamer> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyni05HiqB1qd1hleo1_500.jpg
<Davie_Jones> This woman playing Fluttershy swears up and down that she is an alien in real life.
<Phase4> emangamer: so true
<Phase4> have you got a copy of the bronystate one
<emangamer> huh?
<Davie_Jones> She says she's on a mission to save the Gaia, who I think lives in the Earth, from the horrors of mankind.
<Phase4> someone put the bronystate logo where the mlp logo is
<KetaminaDianePie> hahahaha
<emangamer> MY GOD... http://emangamer.tumblr.com/post/16815861438
<Nyria> What is the bronystate symbol anyway?~
<emangamer> why won't my computr do that?
<emangamer> I think, the one at the top
<Phase4> Dawwww, i remember those
<emangamer> that twilight looks SOOOO adorable
<KetaminaDianePie> :)
<Phase4> Nyria: http://i.imgur.com/Nr7nC.png i think
<Phase4> its what they put on stuff
<emangamer> and then pinkie just being epic
<Davie_Jones> lol
<KetaminaDianePie> hahahahaha
<KetaminaDianePie> OMG
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Would you people mind if I did a quick survey?
<Phase4> not at all
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Okay then
<Davie_Jones> Ok, so Gaia is on a ship over Earth and the closer she gets, the worse her health is. But if the Earth dies, she dies with it
<Davie_Jones> And she's stranded.
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> When you hear "Gaia" what do you think of? A: Green Titan. B: Video Game. C: Nature. D: Planet?
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Greek*
<Phase4> E: final fantasy the bad movie
<Davie_Jones> Now, I think of a crazy person who RP's as Fluttershy rather than saving the world
<Phase4> other than that, C
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> but also thnk she was depicted as green so..
<Kimiko> alright... takin' over..
<Kimiko> =____=
<Dken2021> D
<Phase4> ohai Kimiko
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Hey Shy
*Phase4 will stay up a little mroe for a Kimiko stream
<valoreins> i dunno.. Gaia sounds like a weapon to me
<Nyria> Well I'm off for now toot a loo everybody~
<Phase4> later Nyria
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Hmm.. No one said Planet
<Kimiko> whose idea was it to let Kriza talk in IRC...? =___= owait that was Kriza's idea, and Kriza is an idiot...
<Kimiko> therefore it was a bad idea
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> If only Saturn/Planet6 would be here
<Dken2021> laters Nyria
<Davie_Jones> She RPs as a pony to pass the time and relate to humans
<Phase4> Ictiv|TheOverlord:
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> yes?
<Phase4> herp derp chat
<Davie_Jones> if you want me to ask her a question, just ask.
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> okay
<Kimiko> need to reply to tumblr oh god... so many questions..
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> But does anyone know what Planet I mean under Gaia?
<Phase4> Ictiv|TheOverlord: the concept i have ascociated with 'gaia' is 'planet spirit' if that makes sense
<Davie_Jones> Well that's wrong apparently
<Phase4> but thats just whats in my head, my silly silly head
<Davie_Jones> It's an alien
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Ah, not quite in that way :) I meant as a Fictional Planet
<Davie_Jones> Gaia is an alien
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Anyone know where is a Fictional Planet called Gaia? And what makes it special?
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Anyone?
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> ...Anyone?
<Davie_Jones> no idea
<valoreins> FFIX?
<Dken2021> I just call it as something earth element related
<Phase4> nope
*Ictiv|TheOverlord sighs.
<Phase4> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_%28mythology%29 allso my 'planet spirit' guess wasnt far wrong
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Final F-ing Fantasy?... You people need some serious Asimov treatment
<valoreins> lol
<Funkballs> ohai Phase4
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Why does no body read Asimov?
<Phase4> hi Funkballs , your name is random
<Starflash> Ictiv|TheOverlord, can you timewarp over here and blow up that noisy garbage truck? I'm trying to write a piece here.
<KetaminaDianePie> read suks
<KetaminaDianePie> *reading
<KetaminaDianePie> :d
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Starflash: Timewarp? No. But I can cast a bubble of silence on it.
<valoreins> reading is for twilight sparkle
<Phase4> i was autocompleting Fleur and your name came up instead
*Ictiv|TheOverlord casts spell.
<Starflash> That would help.
<Davie_Jones> This all started because there is a person on SL who RPs as Fluttershy who swears she is an alien here to save the Human race from destroying the Earth and killing her lover, Gaia
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Did it work?
<Starflash> Yes, It did.
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Good
<Dken2021> does it lessen the blow if I told you my favorite author is ray bradbury?
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> For a moment there I was afraid I did the lastt bit off. Could have accidentally sent Penguins into extinction if i get the last bit right
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> wrong*
<Davie_Jones> IF you guys have an account in SL, come to Trotsdale.
<Phase4> huh, my internet got better
<Dken2021> SL?
<Starflash> It probably is because it drove on, but that's probably because that's a more sensical way how my mind would've explained the sudden silence.
<Phase4> oh god that devil falls in love thing is ontv now
<Davie_Jones> Ya, thats where the alien RPs as fluttershy
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Davie_Jones: We mean: What is SL?
<Davie_Jones> Second Life
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Ah
<Dken2021> oh
<Starflash> Oh by the way, you also killed all natural penguins in a hundred mile radius...
<Starflash> = 0 >__>'
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> No I didnt
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> That's not what my spell does
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> If I mess up the last bit then the spell goes to the wrong place
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> strangely enough your location's magical position is pretty close to the Antartic
<Starflash> That's what that potted flower said
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> If I cast a silence spell there, the penguins won't be abel to innitiate their mating calls
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> ergo they won't woo. Ergo: No kids. Ergo: No happy feet 3
<Davie_Jones> That's a blessing
<Starflash> Ergo: happy humanity
<Starflash> Ictiv DOO EET
<Phase4> but then my feet will be sad
<Dken2021> was happy feet 2 worth seeing?
<Starflash> Eenope
<Dken2021> I remember the first one, it was ok
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> The first was pretty good i think... Second? Clichéd but not ALL bad
<Starflash> 1st one is amusing. 2nd is... average
<Dken2021> in terms of talking animals kind of ok
<Hellspawn> theyre both cheese
<Davie_Jones> Anyway, the reason why the alien doesn't talk to humans is all the other attemps to talk to them has lead to the government capturing members of her species.
<Phase4> anyone here seen the moviebob review that mentions happy feet 2?
<Phase4> that was funny
<Phase4> Davie_Jones: wait what?
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Hellspawn: YOu're saying that if aliens invade we should throw Happy Feet DVD-s at them?
<Wrek> 05would you ratehr have me play something else or do something else entirely?
<Davie_Jones> Havne't you beeing paying attention, Phase?
*Phase4 would, but /me is /me
<Phase4> i'm in and of myself a minority
<Davie_Jones> I'm talkingto an alien who RPs as fluttershy
<Rain> I just enjoy watching you do stuff Wrek
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Wrek: Impersonate an English Gentlemen and read us Charles Dicken's Oliver Twist
<Starflash> Of course Phase4 hasn't paid any attention, he should've been in bed a couple of hrs ago
<Rain> inb4 that came out a little creeper esk
<Phase4> i got the fluttershy rp bit but that sentence was just lolwut
<Phase4> head to asdfnsoijafs to apfea
<Davie_Jones> I know. But she's so serious about it that I can't help but play along
<Hellspawn> as a welcome present? why not
<Phase4> my fingers donet ant to work rign
<Dken2021> dat noclip
<Phase4> my fingers dont want to work right'
<Phase4> those stari liek things. seems legit
<Phase4> stair'
<Phase4> like'
*Phase4 *derp*
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Davie_Jones: What if she actually is what she says it is? Should two guys in black suits appear who introduce themselves as letters: Run
<Davie_Jones> Anyway, I told her that if she wants to disable the Government, she just needs to target the satalites and the Ballistic instalations from space, then land in major jpopulation areas.
<Phase4> well its bed time for me
<Phase4> night #BronyState
<Davie_Jones> Oh wait, it's not an alien, Gaia is a Goddess
<Dken2021> night Phase4
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Davie_Jones: She's a Titan
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Mother of all gods and lesser Titans
<valoreins> omg 60s batman theme is catchy...
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> mate of both Cosmos and Kronos
<Dken2021> ok, way wrong about the number of fics of twilight on fanfiction, there's 195,787 of them
<Starflash> Dken2021 good twilight or bad twilight
<Hellspawn> friends of my mom came over to visit us for 2 days and their son is sitting in my room. im nervous ;_;
<Dken2021> I think you know when I say the singular
<Starflash> I think bad twilight
<Dken2021> yup
<Hellspawn> oh god he looked at me
<valoreins> Hellspawn: are they bronies? if they are it's alright
<valoreins> XD
<Hellspawn> germany is 0.4% bronies
<Starflash> So that would make the chance of an existing fanfic actually being better than the book about 90%, when you don't count any prejudices about the writers in...
<Dken2021> he isn't one of those types of kids that are odd is he?
<Suiseiseki> o.o
<Hellspawn> hes playing nintendo ds
<Starflash> Dken2021... <_< >_> 'odd'
<Viri|Away> o.o
<KetaminaDianePie> Killing Spreeeee!!!!!!!!
<Hellspawn> hes investigating my stuff now, brb
<Davie_Jones> Ok, so Gaia is a Goddess who took mortal form.
<Dken2021> wasn't expecting fics of kampfer, but whatever
<Davie_Jones> People used to know of her existance but the humans covered up her existance.
<KetaminaDianePie> nooooooooo
<KetaminaDianePie> :D
<KetaminaDianePie> fk
<KetaminaDianePie> :O
<Davie_Jones> This is funny
<Davie_Jones> Now she's telling about her religion
<Wrek> 05who?
<Dken2021> some RP on second life he's talking about
<Davie_Jones> The 'alien' RPing as Fluttershy
<Hellspawn> he turned out pretty nice. he likes my cameras ^_^
<Wrek> 05shameful that some need to turn to religion for comfort
<KetaminaDianePie> wait wut?
<Wrek> 05snacks are much better
<Davie_Jones> exactly what it sounds like, Pie
<Davie_Jones> Or do you prefer Diane?
<KetaminaDianePie> Keta is good
<Starflash> Wow Wrek. dat interesting religion
<Starflash> It's more convenient though snackbar/market= closer than church
<KetaminaDianePie> btw is second life still working?
<ofna01> more doom?
<Rain> Wrek is better than snaks
<ofna01> hahaha
<ofna01> i agree
<Davie_Jones> I'm waiting for her to get bored of it and just drop it.
<ofna01> the explosions look good
<ofna01> is he using any mods?
<Davie_Jones> I was hoping I could be friends with her, but if she keeps this act up, i'll never get that.
<Wrek> 05snacks are much better
<ofna01> what
<Wrek> 05but yeah as i said, you guys want something else?
<ofna01> skyrim?
<KetaminaDianePie> :(
<KetaminaDianePie> Doom on steroids looks better than skyrim
<ofna01> nope
<ofna01> chuck testa
<KetaminaDianePie> eeeeeyup
<KetaminaDianePie> :OOOOOOO
<ofna01> :/
<KetaminaDianePie> fk this looks IMPOSSIBLE :O
<ofna01> i've beat it
<Rain> sounds like it is boring you Wrek :p
<ofna01> i want him to play skyrim
<Davie_Jones> Well I just cut her off
<Davie_Jones> She just called herself a goddess
<ofna01> who davie
<Davie_Jones> At that point, it stops being a game and it shows that you have a mental problem
<KetaminaDianePie> HAHAHHHA Davie_Jones........
<Davie_Jones> This person RPing as Fluttershy on Second Life
<ofna01> *facepalm*
<Davie_Jones> It was funny for a while when she called herself an alien, but then she crossed a line
<KetaminaDianePie> i wish i had Second Life :(
<ofna01> fluttershy wouldnt even say that XD
<Davie_Jones> I was hoping I had made a friend.
<Davie_Jones> It was OOC, ofna
<Davie_Jones> And Second Life is free, Ketam
<KetaminaDianePie> someone should have recorded that :
<ofna01> what is OOC?
<ofna01> i mean second life
<Dken2021> out of character
<KetaminaDianePie> yeah Davie_Jones i know.. but its too late
<Davie_Jones> too late?
<KetaminaDianePie> to see that RP
<Davie_Jones> Second Life is like a 3D chat sandbox program
<Davie_Jones> It wasn't an RP
<Davie_Jones> It was an OOC chat in Im
<KetaminaDianePie> hmmmmmmmm
<ofna01> is it for mac
<Davie_Jones> Yes
<ofna01> hm
<Davie_Jones> Well, Firestorm is. That's one of the viewers
<ofna01>

<Davie_Jones> I have the chat text. I can copy it all and post it somewhere.
<ofna01> he probably wasnt recording
<ofna01> go for it davie

<otakon> they aren't flourescent green for one
<KetaminaDianePie> orks are good...... btw goblins ROOOOCKS :D!!!!!!!!!!!
<ofna01> i've got the skyrim theme on my MP3
<Randomnerd> Viking God Extraordinaire, Dovakhin Dovakhin
<Rain> lol
<valoreins> lol i saw rathalos's head XD
<Randomnerd> Wearing magic underwear, Dovakhin, Dovakin
<ofna01> dovahkiin,dovahkiin,for the sake of skyrim
<ofna01> thats what i heard
<otakon> KetaminaDianePie: but there are no goblins in this game
<KetaminaDianePie> :( thats bad :(
<otakon> no it's not
<KetaminaDianePie> HEY!
<otakon> they felt REALLY out of place in Oblivion
<Randomnerd> He's here to kill the dragon, just let him off the wagon
<otakon> brb biobreak
<KetaminaDianePie> sorry i dont know Oblivion that well......
<KetaminaDianePie> well
<KetaminaDianePie> i dont know about Oblivion at all :D!
<ofna01> name him dovahkiin
<Randomnerd> You know you want to hame him something obscene, Wrek.
<KetaminaDianePie> Zporko Wrek!
<KetaminaDianePie> Zporko is a good ork name :D!
<Randomnerd> Porkins?
<ofna01> gaz rock?
<ofna01> gas rock?
<ofna01> it was a dragon
<Dashie_Dashie> LOL
<ofna01> off with his head!
<KetaminaDianePie> btw where are u from otakon? (if i may ask :))
<LunaScarlet> skyrim yes
<ofna01> at first i thought it said nice and sexy
<otakon> back
<otakon> maryland, the middle of the eastcoast in the US
<ofna01> their blind i guess
<otakon> Why does she ask that?
<otakon> WE can clearly see it's a damn DRAGON
<ofna01> i know right?
<otakon> or at least something BIG SCALY and PISSED OFF LOOKING!
<valoreins> y u no use the fluttershy dragon mod? XD
<ofna01> there's a fluttershy dragon mod?
<otakon> valoreins: you would kill Fluttershy! monster!
<valoreins> otakon: of course i won't.. i'll just run away :p
<ofna01> 6_9
<Wrek> 05because if i was usign that mod
<Wrek> 05i wouldnt be able to kill any dragons
<otakon> see!
<Frostsleepin> Any chance I can talk to a server admin asap?
<otakon> I told you!
<ofna01> lol
<valoreins> eeeyup
<otakon> hmmm
<ofna01> well no crap
<otakon> they need to mod it so when you give Fluttershy enough brushings, she falls asleep and give you the soul
<LunaScarlet> if only i had skyrim then i would fastly install pony mods
<Starflash> Oh lookie~ I come back and skyrim.
<otakon> I don't have a computer capable of running it
<LunaScarlet> can you install mods on consoles?
<ofna01> me neither
<otakon> nope
<LunaScarlet> aww too bad
<otakon> unless you crack the console
<valoreins> but that would be awkward if i kill fluttershy and what i get is dragon scales and bones...
<ofna01> you can do that?
<otakon> pisses me off nowadays too
<Starflash> LunaScarlet somepony probably found out some really complicated way to do it...
<otakon> ofna01: it can be done, but it voids the warranty and if you don't know what your doing it can break your system
<ofna01> makes sense
<Davie_Jones> So ofna, did you read all of the log?
<KetaminaDianePie> i still cant understand why is this game soo good............
<ofna01> take the sword!
<Dashie_Dashie> Morrowind started it for me.
<ofna01> yeah davie i read it
<otakon> KetaminaDianePie: it's the exploration, graphics and the ability to mold your character in various ways
<otakon> I LOVE the exploration aspect of the ES games
<Dashie_Dashie> mostly the vastly well made landscapes.
<Dashie_Dashie> for me that is.
<otakon> yeah
<Davie_Jones> ON a scale of one to ten, how crazy is she?
<Starflash> Ohai Dashie_Dashie ~
<otakon> Davie_Jones: who?
<ofna01> 9
<Dashie_Dashie> ohai Starflash~
<Davie_Jones> You've seen crazier?
<otakon> hiya Starflash
<ofna01> no
<KetaminaDianePie> yeahhh..... maybe.......... but i think FP doesnt fit RPG that much....... and the lack of multiplayer...........
<Starflash> otakon you were already there when I brb'd. XD
<otakon> I was?
<ofna01> bloodeh swords
<Starflash> yeah :O
<Davie_Jones> Then why a nine?
<Starflash> I think..
<ofna01> i dunno davie
<ofna01> i guess a 10
<ofna01> owned
<KetaminaDianePie> RPG MUST be multiplayer in my opinion............
<MirrorImage> is wrek the one playing?
<otakon> KetaminaDianePie: MP! not EVERYTHING needs MP nowadays! also FP is fine, how else would you play a exploration focused game?
<ofna01> yeah
<Starflash> Oh btw otakon you've got PonySquare?
<otakon> no
<Starflash> ok~
<Dashie_Dashie> I love how Machinima had a vote to see which game is better
<Dashie_Dashie> This
<Dashie_Dashie> or The old republic..
<Dashie_Dashie> you can't compare a Single play rpg to a mmorpg
<Dashie_Dashie> *facehoof*
<KetaminaDianePie> maybe ur right................ i just cant stand mainstream games...... and with a customization games (like RPGs) MUST show your character whole time.....
<valoreins> it's like comparing fluttershy with pinkie pie, right?
<otakon> indeed
<otakon> KetaminaDianePie: you only really see your character when you go 3rd person
<MirrorImage> it depends on how the MMORPG is designed
<KetaminaDianePie> ow damn i fail that sentence
<MirrorImage> if the MMO is largely single-player with social aspects, that's one thing
<KetaminaDianePie> oooo
<KetaminaDianePie> :O!
<otakon> true
<otakon> but half the time no one is social
<KetaminaDianePie> owww
<otakon> you okay KetaminaDianePie?
<otakon> so, he's DUAL WEILDING in ROBES?
<ofna01> yesh
<ofna01> which is badass
<otakon> he's making the squishiest character ever
<MirrorImage> otakon - i've gone two-hand flames in full heavy metal armor
<ofna01> squishie squishie squishie
<MirrorImage> it's stupidly effective
<otakon> MirrorImage: well that's good
<otakon> that's a Battlemage
<ofna01> Mirror used Noob Move!
<otakon> Heavy Armor and Magic
<ofna01> its super effective!
<MirrorImage> It's Super Effective!
<KetaminaDianePie> third person swich fk me up 6_9
<KetaminaDianePie> I DIDNT KNOW ABOUT IT!!!
<otakon> yeah I do miss how you could see your guy in the menu in this though
<valoreins> should have had that armor spell with mage armor skill, you're safe with using that
<ofna01> bear
<ofna01> burn
<otakon> inb4 ded
<MirrorImage> valoreins - i used that as well
<otakon> damn, close
<Dismo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDTXAgYtHQ

<KetaminaDianePie> U can steal in this game?!?
<ofna01> yes
<MirrorImage> of course your can KetaminaDianePie - it's a Bethesda game
<ofna01> see?
<Yellowquiet> lol
<valoreins> and you can kill normal NPC *evil grin*
<MirrorImage> in most cases
<MirrorImage> children you can't, and essential NPCs
<ofna01> my uncle's partner did that
<Yellowquiet> if you go with the imperial on the beginning you dont need to steel from the smith
<KetaminaDianePie> omg i HAVE to advertise my friends about this game........ they lost faith in this after Fable 2 came out!
<valoreins> and there's a mod that lets you kill children
<ofna01> the blacksmith bumped into him,and his partner cut off his head
<ofna01> loll
<ofna01> choppy choppy wood
<Wrek> 05easy cash
<ofna01> so is pickpocketing
<KetaminaDianePie> im doing this NOW!
<Wrek> 05so is your mom
<Yellowquiet> there are much easier ways ^^
<Tarku> if your not in a poor village ofna01
<Dashie_Dashie> ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhh snap
<ofna01> god wrek
<MirrorImage> did that kid just pull a dagger?
<ofna01> LOL
<ofna01> i think so
<valoreins> nice
<ofna01> everyone had weapons back then
<Yellowquiet> hey you have the mod for killing childrens
<MirrorImage> well that's one way to get 1000 bounty
<ofna01> wtf
<TrixieMuffin> DONT ROAST THAT KID YOU DONT HAVE ANY KETCHUP
<ofna01> ROFL
<ofna01> how is that shield shape
<ofna01> ...
<xcanox> lol
<Yellowquiet> XD
<ofna01> i would grab illusion if i were you
<Suiseiseki> 03o.o
<Yellowquiet> why illusion ?
<ofna01> good for assassins
<Yellowquiet> ah
<MirrorImage> "Papa says I'm too friendly, but you look like a nice person."
<MirrorImage> *Kill her... she knows too much*
<ofna01> lol
<Yellowquiet> XD
<ofna01> but you look like a nice person *get stabbed*
<ofna01> D:
<ofna01> chop
<Yellowquiet> working in a game omg
<ofna01> chop
<ofna01> you have to work in minecraft
<Yellowquiet> thats why i dont play minecraft
<Yellowquiet> ^^
<ofna01> hmph
<MirrorImage> yes, but that's working to survive
<MirrorImage> rather than working for gold
<ofna01> you should try minecraft yellow
<valoreins> omg this reminds me when when i play skyrim at college... some people thought i was playing assassin's creed :P
<Yellowquiet> i tried it once
<Yellowquiet> then i played the fraking weekend
<MirrorImage> depending on your play style, you might as well be valoreins
<ofna01> stab heem
<Yellowquiet> it is just a bit to boring
<valoreins> i was a mage back then, no backstabbing whatsoever
<ofna01> i would just go on a rampage probably
<ofna01> SHUT UP STAAAB
*Yellowquiet suddenly wants to play skyrim
<Yellowquiet> see you later
<Tarku> same
*ofna01 trout slaps yellow for not liking minecraft
<Yellowquiet> haha

<ofna01> you find any ocelots yet tarku?
<valoreins> i'll decide with a coin, heas: skyrim, tail: minecraft
<KetaminaDianePie> if you like legos valoreins play minecraft.... otherwise play skyrim
<Tarku> spawned in the middle on 50+ lol
<ofna01> keta

<ofna01> *facepalm*
<ofna01> does lego's have lava?
<KetaminaDianePie> Y NOT?!?!?!
<ofna01> WOLFIE
<KetaminaDianePie> wut?
<ofna01> D:
<Presea> rawr
<ofna01> i have pet wolves on minecraft
<valoreins> but there is this minecraft lego texture pack XD
<ofna01> hey valo
<valoreins> so minecraft=lego :D
<ofna01> quick question
<valoreins> yea?
<Randomnerd> :O
<ofna01> i've got a texture pack installed,but it wont show up in the list
<ofna01> ....
<KetaminaDianePie> hahahahahah :D!
<Dashie_Dashie> Did you save it to the right folder/
<Dashie_Dashie> ?*
<ofna01> so you kill a lady,and start chopping wood?
<ofna01> yeah dashie
<Dashie_Dashie> odd..
<Randomnerd> And stripped her!
<ofna01> rofl
<valoreins> oh someone could answer it for you XD.. <never tried texture pack
<Dashie_Dashie> Randomnerd: Welcome to skyrim.

<ofna01> welcome to skyrim
<Tarku> lol pansy swings
<valoreins> skyrim logic
<Dashie_Dashie> Like a boss.
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Fun fact: You can drag bodies. Only creepier thing than killing a lady and then starting to chop wood would have been to drag her neck on the wood chopping plank and start chopping
<Sumica> 00,10Morning all
<ofna01> dead body
<Tarku> mornin Sumica
<ofna01> Ictiv

<ofna01> he did sumi
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> ofna01: Tell me about it. I had to deal with it creeping into my head. I'm starting to develop a Lyra syndrome now that she's not here
<KetaminaDianePie> hey Sumica!
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> There must be one!
<Tarku> he just did Sumica :P
<ofna01> i can om nom nom liquids

<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZFNSsB58YY
<ofna01> yeah keta
<ofna01> otherwise known as a balisong
*KetaminaDianePie swings his butterfly knife
<ofna01> you dont swing it
<ofna01> you twirl it
<KetaminaDianePie> owwww
<KetaminaDianePie> k
<ofna01> you never seen a butterfly knife?
<KetaminaDianePie> i HAVE a butterfly knife.....
<KetaminaDianePie> im playing with it right now
<Davie_Jones> What if the world was like a clock
<ofna01> mine should be in friday keta
<ofna01> its a training one,though
<KetaminaDianePie> a training one :O?!?!?!?!
<KetaminaDianePie> with a plastic blade?
<Davie_Jones> Intrecate and perfectly balanced to work away without stopping.
<ofna01> no
<ofna01> not a plastic blade
*Ictiv|TheOverlord clears throat, straightens tie and looks up seriously.
<ofna01> its metal,except dulled,so i dont chop off my finger
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Where-a be yo Kamma-junk!?
<KetaminaDianePie> then with a rubber band on the blade?
<KetaminaDianePie> oooooowwwwwwwww
*Davie_Jones pouts and walks off
<KetaminaDianePie> oh no Davie_Jones!
<ofna01> cut yourself keta?
<KetaminaDianePie> first times yes.....
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Davie_Jones: I have bad news. The world IS like a clock.
<KetaminaDianePie> but it was like........
<ofna01> i wanna be like the spy off TF2
<KetaminaDianePie> uhhhhh......
<KetaminaDianePie> OMG
<ofna01> *ahem* gentlemen?
<KetaminaDianePie> 10 years ago
<KetaminaDianePie> :O
<Davie_Jones> Well, then what if the ponies a long time ago kept poking at the clock? Making winters a little bit shorter, or making it rain where it shouldn't rain, ect.
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> ofna01: MMMMPHHHHHHMMMM!
<KetaminaDianePie> im getting old :(
<Davie_Jones> What would eventually happen to that clock?
<ofna01> what overlod
<KetaminaDianePie> you silly..................... the world IS a clock :D!
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Davie_Jones: Their actions would technicalyl be part of the clock
<Davie_Jones> The clock would still function without them being there.
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Oh but that's not true
<ofna01> guys,im too tired to think
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> If they wouldn't be there, it wouldn't have reached the exact point it did
<ofna01> stop talking smart
<pony_1407> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TcddoSCB8I
<Davie_Jones> What?
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> it would be a diffrent point entriely
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Davie_Jones: Think of it this way:
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> You can say that the Earth would work perfectly without humans no?
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> But there would be a lot of things very different
<ofna01> it wouldnt
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> a lot of speices would still exists.. a lot of species would NOT exists
<Davie_Jones> It was intended to. There is nothing that humans have to actively do to keep animals migrating and the water currents cyclating.
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Davie_Jones: But it would be completely different
<Davie_Jones> Animals existing and going exstinct is part of the function
<KetaminaDianePie> really..... How couldnt you compare minecraft to Lego?!?!? (im not talking about lego system or so)
<Davie_Jones> I'm talking about changing the rules.
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Indee
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> That's the problem. You can't change the rules of a clock without buildign a new clock
<Davie_Jones> As in actually making the orbit of the planet change to extend summer.
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> you can' take out a cog and put in a smaller one
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Davie_Jones: That is still part of the clock
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> that is not much different than making a species extinct
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> it LOOKS bigger
<Davie_Jones> Exactly. The ponies kept poking at the gears and springs to make the clock change. Eventually.... it broke.
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> but in an infinite universe its not bigger at all
*ofna01 trout slaps overlord and davie
<ofna01> now both of ya,shut up!
<Davie_Jones> Nuuuu
*Davie_Jones dramaticly falls in slowmo from the traut slap
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> ofna01: But we're having a fun, phylosophical conversation!
*ofna01 cant beleive that worked
<Davie_Jones> You mean 'filly'sophical
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Our High School teachers would be so proud!...Well rather indifferent... but you know what i mean!
*ofna01 laughs at davie falling slowly
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> "fillyspohical"... Okay I can't talk serious with this man.
*Ictiv|TheOverlord turns to ofna01.
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> What are your thoughts on paralel dimensional multiverse theory?
*ofna01 walks away
<Davie_Jones> The point I was getting to is the reason why the ponies have to change the seasons, raise the sun and moon and guide the birds is because they broke the world.
*ofna01 takes out butterfly knife and twirls it
*Davie_Jones puts on his razerback
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Davie_Jones: The everfree forest changes its on whether though
<ofna01> now,you guys can shut up,or i can demonstrate how to backstabe
<Davie_Jones> There are still parts that function normally, however those are isolated and are exceptoins
*ofna01 closes knife and puts it in my pocket
<Davie_Jones> Like people who can survive from a headshot
<Dashie_Dashie> Because ponies live in a world where everything depends on eachother to survive.
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> I think they don't HAVE to, they just developed an economy that needs the seasons to be perfectly orderly
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> In my opinion only Equstria works like this
<ofna01> thats it
<Davie_Jones> What do you base your thoughts on that?
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> and not becasue it can't do other wise, but because they need it like that
*ofna01 pulls out huntsman and aims at davie
*Davie_Jones pulls out his flamethrower
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Davie_Jones: First of all: Their concern was not "Spring won't come" but "Spring will come late"
*ofna01 cloaks
<KetaminaDianePie> HEY!
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> secondly, a single forest won't live normally on a planet with a broken ecosystem
<Davie_Jones> You mean they'll be late for spring
<KetaminaDianePie> love and tollerance you sillyes :D!
*ofna01 trout slaps keta
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Davie_Jones: yes
<pony_1407> stop beeing fillysophical and look @ the skyrim dude, he's in deep shit with the thief
<ofna01> not anymore
<KetaminaDianePie> * :[
<pony_1407> oh he's dead
<Davie_Jones> I just got finished watchingg that episode. it was about them being late for spring. As in teh town in relation to the rest of the nation.
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> yes
*ofna01 trout slaps davie over and over
*Davie_Jones airblasts Ofna away
*ofna01 calls in OFC
<ofna01> hehehe
<Davie_Jones> OFC?
<ekips> mfw the thief nearly killed the only hope for the world
<ofna01> orbital friendship cannon
*Davie_Jones ubercharges
<ofna01> OFC beats ubercharg
<Davie_Jones> HAAAXX!
*Davie_Jones throws a monitor at Ofna
<ofna01> nope
<Wrek> 05only got one thing to say
*Wrek uses deathstar.
*ofna01 matrix dodges and airblasts back at davie
<KetaminaDianePie> deathstar ftw
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Anyway, it seemed to me that the whether was not necessarily broken. In the real world there are a lot of natural "disasters" in the form of a cold that comes in, hurting the harvest. Heat waves, again bad for an agricultural economy
<TOY_PON3> Good morning everyone :3
*ofna01 calls in luke skywalker
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> So they decided to control everything
<ofna01> :3
<KetaminaDianePie> Hey TOY_PON3
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> this doesn't mean they NEED to controll it
<Tarku> mornin TOY_PON3
<Jim> Ohai everypony
<ofna01> mornin PON3
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> but it is part of their agriculture
<Davie_Jones> If that is true, thry do they still have to arrange bad storms?
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> "Bad Storms"?
<Davie_Jones> Remember the sleep over episode?
*ofna01 stabs davie
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> There isn't such a thing as a "Bad Strom"
<TOY_PON3> Hey Jim, Ictiv|TheOverlord, ofna01, and KetaminaDianePie
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> there are Storms
<ofna01> i told ya to shut up!
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> and thsoe are good for the land
<Dashie_Dashie|The_Ki> someone stole his sweet roll :c
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> Hey TOY_PON3
<KetaminaDianePie> Jim? Wb Jim!
<TOY_PON3> Hey Dashie_Dashie|The_Ki
<Davie_Jones> I don't wanna
<ofna01> zebra cakes > sweet roles
<Ictiv|TheOverlord> I remeber, yes there are lightnings
<TOY_PON3> Hey Davie_Jones
<TOY_PON3> :P

*KetaminaDianePie sings "the streeeeam is on"
<Ictiv> That's my idea of subtly refferncing Little-Miss-Jay by the way
<Ictiv> if you were wondering
<Wrek> 05howto refference LMJ when drawing rarity: add a thin thin almost not even sisible teeth line on her flank.
<Ictiv> ^
<Ictiv> You seem well versed in refferencing him by the way.
<KetaminaDianePie> is this some Star Wars?
<Ictiv> That silly 'sleepy' Twilight and her silly book for example
<Ictiv> KetaminaDianePie: Ref Faction actually
<Wrek> 05I am very educated in his arts
<KetaminaDianePie> owwwwwww
<Ictiv> Wrek: he just threw a huge tantrum earlier about him hating "Jay Naylor"'s guts. I don't know why though, was there some sort of history I'm missing?
<KetaminaDianePie> Spacecraft FPS are even cheaper to program then normal FPSs
<Davie_Jones> Jay Naylor is weird
<MirrorImage> Jay Naylor is a furry artist
<Davie_Jones> That's a moot point. he's weird even among furries
<Ictiv> I know what he is. But his non-adult-adult comic is pretty good in my opinion
<MirrorImage> Ictiv - agreed
<KetaminaDianePie> hey grampa!
<Wrek> 05to be honest
<Davie_Jones> If you don't mind being flattened by anvils thoughout the entire story
<Wrek> 05i could care less about him as a person
<Wrek> 05but i like his arts
<Wrek> 05and art is the only thign i care about
<ofna01> k
<Wrek> 05(except the obvius such as gaming and you guise)
<Ictiv> We feel honoured
<Ictiv> Feel as you will :)
<KetaminaDianePie> gaming desining is an art you silly
<Hat> Isn't Jay Naylor a Starcraft character
<Davie_Jones> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious

<Wrek> 05the style is cute
<Jim> ohai Globetrotter
<KetaminaDianePie> style is soooooooooooooo 90s :D!
<Globetrotter> What's on the stream?
<Wrek> 05a sexy tank
<Globetrotter> I wan't this game.
<Globetrotter> want*
<Globetrotter> What is it?
<Davie_Jones> I actually just commented on that, Wrek
<Davie_Jones> Left a protip
<Jim> Shoot things that blow up :the video game
<Hat> They should make a movie about that!
<Wrek> 05monfang
<Wrek> 05added to stalk list
<Davie_Jones> Yes
<ofna01> its like starfox
<Davie_Jones> yay
<ofna01> its got planes and tanks
<KetaminaDianePie> DO A BARRELROLL!
<Davie_Jones> you should see the debate I got into over someone saying that 'Ditzy Doo' never existed
<KetaminaDianePie> :)
<KetaminaDianePie> maaaaaan i sure love StarFox Assault
<Ictiv> KetaminaDianePie: Barrelrolls are so 80s--- Do a SwaggerRoll!
<KetaminaDianePie> :)
<Davie_Jones> Funfact, the Barrel Rolls in starfox aren't barrel rolls
<Jim> Rick Rolls are only beaten by Barrel Rolls and Swaggerrolls
<KetaminaDianePie> of course theyr not!
<Ictiv> Davie_Jones: Wait... Someone said Ditzy Doo generally didn't exist or that "Derpy" was never her?
<KetaminaDianePie> a barrelroll is a navy torture
<Davie_Jones> Let me get the quote..
<MirrorImage> Ictiv - there's still general arguments whether Ditzy Doo from Winter Wrap Up was the Derpy we know
<Ictiv> Jim: DoN't forget about Dick Rolls. (As in Richard Rolls)
<Ictiv> MirrorImage: I know
<ofna01> wat
<ofna01> davie
<ofna01> how are barrelrolls in starfox not barrelrolls?
<Davie_Jones> One thing at a time.
<Jim> They're not in a barrel! Duh!
<Davie_Jones> First the Ditzy do thing
<ofna01> its like an airleon roll right?
<Davie_Jones> ^ That
<Davie_Jones> Now can I get to it?!
<ofna01> thought so
<ofna01> yesh
<Davie_Jones> First, I said: "Ditzy Doo used to be her name, however there was so much fan support to Derpy Hooves, that they changed it."
<Davie_Jones> Which is true, Lauren Faust said so on her Devian Art page
<Davie_Jones> He countered: "They never officially showed Ditzy Doo."
<KetaminaDianePie> maaaaaaaaaan Starfox Assault is best Starfox :))))))
<ofna01> lolno
<Jim> Achievement Unlocked
<KetaminaDianePie> yes
<Wrek> 05oh look, another mag by slugbox is out apparently
<Davie_Jones> After being stunned for a few moments, I named one instance of her existance. "Episode with the Pinky Senses. When Twilight is in her wheelchair and is watching Pinky, after he is hit with all the stuff, the camera pans up with a grey-blue pegasis pony looking embarrassed. That's Derpy Hooves formally known as Ditzy Doo."
*Wrek goes to order
<Ictiv> Second best roll of the world: http://www.lfgcomic.com/page/144
<Jim> - Blew something up
<Wrek> 05DONT JUDGE MEEEEEH
<ofna01> dude,game informer said it was like putting gas on pancakes
<ofna01> ruined something great
<Davie_Jones> Am I wrong at any point thus far?
<KetaminaDianePie> daaaaamn dont trust reviews you silly!
<ofna01> no
<ofna01> i played it
<Ictiv> Wrek: Why would I judge you in an infinite universe where blood sacraficing people have equally as much proof of being right about god, as people who retreat to mountains and live in silence?
<MirrorImage> Davie_Jones the issue with that particular point is that Derpy wasn't recognized in the show until episode 15
<Davie_Jones> Well it wasn't good enough for him. He countered: "She was never officially called Ditzy Doo in the show. They referred to a Ditzy Doo in Winter Wrap Up, but it was never shown to be Derpy."
<MirrorImage> as it was, when the fan hype over it came out, Lauren had Derpy changed in episodes that hadn't yet been sent to Hasbro for broadcast
<MirrorImage> Episode 15 was the first of such episodes; Winter Wrap Up was printed and out the door before Derpy received formal acknowledgement like that
<Davie_Jones> So I pulled out the 'Word of God' trope with the quote from Deviant Art though the KnowYourMeme website. "Background ponies have no name, and their butt symbols are picked at random, so she can be Derpy if everyone likes. A later episode references a less-than-intelligent local pegasus named “Ditzy Doo” so maybe she can be her if we ever need to show her. But I would not want to step
<Davie_Jones> on everyone’s Derpy love."
<KetaminaDianePie> soooooo is Derpy a boy in the cartoon then?
<RAWRity> eenope
<MirrorImage> Davie_Jones - and again, the name Ditzy was already in production by the time we came up with Derpy
<KetaminaDianePie> is a she?
<RAWRity> also, suddenly RAWRity
<KetaminaDianePie> we noticed that
<Ictiv> KetaminaDianePie: She is a She... Only voice actress didn't know that
<KetaminaDianePie> :)
<MirrorImage> though it will be curious to see what comes of this with that "backlash" that Hasbro has now been informed of
<RAWRity> wait...is the Derpy/Ditzy discussion STILL going on?
<Davie_Jones> right, Mirror, but here we have Lauren stating that 'she can be here if we ever need to show her'.
<KetaminaDianePie> but she hadnt daughters
<Davie_Jones> *her
<ofna01> yeah rawr
<Dismo> Is there a stream, Or am I lagging?
<KetaminaDianePie> .....
<Davie_Jones> His final counter was: "Not in an episode, doesn't matter. That pony was never explicitly shown to be Ditzy Doo."
<RAWRity> ...HOW is taht still going on. They used her name. Game Over. Ditzy Doo is some other pony.
<KetaminaDianePie> "The streeeeeeam is oooooon"
<MirrorImage> RAWRity - we don't know that for certain
<KetaminaDianePie> DO A BARREL ROLLL!
<MirrorImage> "Derpy" seems rather short for an MLP name; it could just be a nickname
<Davie_Jones> Basicly, it is only canon to this weirdo if they show her face and give her name. I'm willing to bet this guy won't believe that Luke Skywalker was married because it wasn't in the movie.
<MirrorImage> (don't mind me - I play devil's advocate in these kind of arguments ALOT)
<RAWRity> MirrorImage: She was Called Derpy. We have literally never been given ANY indication that her name was Ditzy, or that Ditzy had ANYTHING to do with her in any way.
<Davie_Jones> Her full name is Derpy Hooves.
<Ictiv> Davie_Jones: Luke Skywalker was Married?
<Davie_Jones> In the books
<Ictiv> Ah
<Davie_Jones> Had two kids, one turned to the dark side.
<KetaminaDianePie> the whole episode btw is about Derpys "daughter" :D
<Davie_Jones> spoiler, btw
<Ictiv> Okay
<Lasharus> Which game is streaming?
<Globetrotter> Guys! Guys! One of my friends came out the stable today!
<Ictiv> For a moment I thought that in the past
<Ictiv> That would have been weird
<ofna01> seriously globe?
<RAWRity> Globetrotter: is that what we're calling it now?
<Lasharus> That's nice Globetrotter.
<Jim> Cool Globetrotter ^^
<Globetrotter> RAWRity he's now a brony
<Davie_Jones> Spike is voiced by a girl?
<KetaminaDianePie> yes
<Ictiv> Davie_Jones: I think
<RAWRity> I thought that was just called Joining the Herd
<Globetrotter> He's a brony not a homosexual just for clairity
<ofna01> welcome to the herd rawr
<ofna01> im the same way globe
<Lasharus> Yeah, probably need a different comparison Globetrotter.
<ofna01> not gay but still a Brony
<MirrorImage> RAWRity - Joining the Herd; Coming out of the Stable; yatta yatta yatta
<diddutz> is this "red faction something" ?
<Lasharus> Because I literally didn't know which of the two you were going for.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3good morning everypony :)
<Globetrotter> Good idea Lasharus
<RAWRity> Yes. Most males in shows animation are voiced by females, yes.
<Ictiv> RAWRity: Coming out of the stable is more like coming out of a closet. When he was in the herd already but not officialyl
<Lasharus> Morning kirz. :)
<KetaminaDianePie> like Burt Simpson.................
<Davie_Jones> I bet it is because guys don't want to be assosicated with a girl's show.
<Lasharus> And which game is this?
<Jim> ohai kirzstryfe
<RAWRity> for instance, Phil and Lil from Rugrats had the same VA.
<Globetrotter> Thank you Ictiv
<Jim> Red Faction I believe
<Lasharus> Ah.
*Ictiv tips hat at Globetrotter.
<KetaminaDianePie> DO A TANKROLLL!!!!!!!!!!
<ofna01> rofl
<diddutz> ACHIVEMENT!
<KetaminaDianePie> nooooooooooooo
<RAWRity> f
<KetaminaDianePie> f?

<RAWRity> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-and-none-for-you.png
<Wrek> 05if its twilight, throw it my way
<Wrek> 05<3
<Dismo> ;_; I can't pick a single pony, It would hurt everypony's feelings.
<Lasharus> Duly noted Dismo.
<Jim> I know what you mean Dismo, I also love all of them
<Lasharus> I just feel I identify most with Twilight. :P
<ofna01> ;/
<RAWRity> I enjoy Rarity's scenes/jokes the most.
<ofna01> meh
<ofna01> she doesnt really joke that much
<KetaminaDianePie> btw on the manes.......... Pinkie Pie is the best.........
<RAWRity> mostly thanks to Tabitha doing a fantastic job with her voice. "I know where you live!"
<KetaminaDianePie> No Pinkie Pie no MLP fandome
<KetaminaDianePie> *fandom(?)
<ofna01> yeah we had enough wwith cupcakes
<RAWRity> I disagree
<DubZbrony> Pinkie ftw Woooh!
<Davie_Jones> Ok, can a girl explain this to me.
<Davie_Jones> Any girls here, per chance.
<KetaminaDianePie> HEY!
<Wrek> 05shoot
<Davie_Jones> Or feminate guys
<Wrek> 05ask away
<KetaminaDianePie> im not talking about cupcakes FUUUUUUCK!
<Davie_Jones> Why didn't the girls like their new dresses?
<EspyLacopa> Spike is the same actor as Shampoo?
<EspyLacopa> What madness is this?
<Davie_Jones> They look great to me. Why do they look.... turned off by them?
<KetaminaDianePie> Spike is Omochao........
<Wrek> 05I'd answer that liek this: ever been drawing?
<Wrek> 05like
<Wrek> 05you have this iamge in your head
<Wrek> 05and how awesome it is
<Wrek> 05but when you draw it its rubbish?
<Lasharus> KetaminaDianePie - as in same VA?
<Lasharus> Oh deary me...
<xcanox> Wrek mah boy.
<Wrek> 05kina like that
<ofna01> pew pew pew
<RAWRity> Davie_Jones: 2 explanations. 1: They had built up their own expectation on what it should be, and when the real deal didn't match up with what they'd expected, they decided they didn't like it. or, alternatively: They have really bad taste.
<KetaminaDianePie> dunnno if its the same :D!
<xcanox> Wrek, I have a question.
<Lasharus> ...
<Wrek> 05shoot
<Davie_Jones> RAWRity makes more sense
<KetaminaDianePie> i just LOVE to hate him :D!
<Davie_Jones> I'd hit all the girls with my cane if I was there.
<EspyLacopa> RAWRity: Considering what their 'vision' dresses ended up being, I'm leaning towards bad taste.
<Sumica> 00,10have no idea how to use this thing
<Wrek> 05Sumica
<Wrek> 05teach me nao
<Wrek> 05skype
<Wrek> 05xD
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol
<xcanox> On most clients, when you get highlighted, the message is colored. So if you were to use a client, would you mistake said message for using a color?
<Dismo> FFFFFFFFFFFFF-
<Dismo> That noise.
<Wrek> 05...what?
<xcanox> Well, for example..
<xcanox> If you were using XChat, and I said "Wrek," the message would be red.
<xcanox> Even if I didn't color it.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3that's only in your client
<Wrek> 05xchat sucks
<Wrek> 05use mIRC
<kirzstryfe> 1,3^
<Lasharus> Hell yeah mIRC! :P
<xcanox> Nah XChat master race.
<Lasharus> (Yes, I am using mIRC just now.)
<RAWRity> you know, it's kinda funny
<ofna01> ...
<Lasharus> I'm sorry.
<Sumica> 00,10teach you what wrek how to talk with out isung LS?
<Wrek> 05well duh
<Lasharus> Did you just call yourself the master race for using a program?
<KetaminaDianePie> mIRC is not free btw :(
<Globetrotter> oooh, just found the smooth tool on illustrator, it's like a magic cleaning steam rion
<RAWRity> the internet's been around for nearly 20 years, yet we still haven't found a better Chat tool than IRC.
<Lasharus> Because I think it's time for a little creative genocide of the master raice, in that case. :P
<Lasharus> *race.
<RAWRity> well, I'm off to get lunch. see you all later.
<KetaminaDianePie> master race?!?!?!?!?
<Wrek> 05also xcanox
<Lasharus> Laters RAWRity.
<KetaminaDianePie> WUT?
<xcanox> Yes?
<Wrek> 05that is what differs you from me, your choice for words.
<xcanox> Interesting.
<KetaminaDianePie> BYE RAWrity
<Lasharus> And that is what differs you from me Wrek. Your choice OF words.
<KetaminaDianePie> owwww
<xcanox> That was the most relevant thing I've had remarked to me all day. :P
<Lasharus> (Yes, I'm a sod :P)
<Davie_Jones> WAIT!
<Wrek> 05that is a matter of nationality xD
<Davie_Jones> How do ponies know what FRENCH o Cature is?
<Lasharus> No it's not :P
<Wrek> 05it is now
<Lasharus> Ghehe.
<Jim> They don't, it's fancy
<MirrorImage> Davie_Jones - because there's a Pony France?
<Davie_Jones> ..........makes sense
*kirzstryfe noms on Lasharus' foot
<Lasharus> Sorry Wrek, linguist here. I sort of have to know what I'm talking about :P
<xcanox> I suspect my dialect contains some southern influences.
<Lasharus> Oh for-
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:3
*Lasharus shakes kirzstryfe off.
<Wrek> 05im not native, i am excused
<xcanox> My family heritage leads down to the south.
<Wrek> 05>:3
<Lasharus> Neither am I, you are not.
*Lasharus grins.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3ey liek pohnez
<Wrek> 05:|
<xcanox> kirzstryfe: Who doesn't?
<Wrek> 05linguist huh?
<Lasharus> Yip.
<Wrek> 05how many languages?
<xcanox> I'm not a linguist.
<Lasharus> English, primarily, but with branches into Old Germanic languages.
<xcanox> I'm an anarchist.
*Jim can't speak fancy.
<xcanox> Little girl, does your mama know you're out tonight?
<Lasharus> (No, I can't speak the Old Germanic languages. I can barely translate them)
<Wrek> 05så svenska kan vara lite förståeligt i alla fall?
<xcanox> And if she did, would she die of frieght just to know you're out with me?
<Wrek> 05muhaha
<KetaminaDianePie> me neither... but i understand English, and most latin languages.....
<Jim> Jeg forstår svensk i allefall
<kirzstryfe> 1,3yez, boot ef ewe tipe werds rong, Lash gitz crazi
<xcanox> Little girl, do you think that I'm a fool?
<Davie_Jones> So apparently Rarity's cat has 'ugly' senses or something
*Lasharus smacks kirzstryfe upside the head.
<xcanox> And if you do, does it change your mind?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3<3
<xcanox> Or will you love me all the time?
<Davie_Jones> Wonder what it says about her not liking Rarity?
<Wrek> 05oi jim
<xcanox> I'm so much older than you.
<Wrek> 05norsk eller dansk?
<Lasharus> I can translate small bits of that Wrek, but my Swedish is limited, I'll admit.
<Jim> Norsk
<xcanox> You don't know what I'm going through.
<Wrek> 05scandihoof
<Jim> *scandihoof*
<xcanox> I only know that this feeling inside, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide nooo nooo.
<Wrek> 05i can give you free lessons Lasharus xD
<Lasharus> Ghehe.
<Lasharus> More languages are always nice.
<Wrek> 05you can pay in porn
<xcanox> Esperanto is the only language the world needs.
<Lasharus> Oh dear...
<kirzstryfe> 1,3first hand accounts only
<KetaminaDianePie> xcanox :[[[[[[[[[
<Jim> Seems like a fair deal, you should do it Lasharus
<Lasharus> Once this semester is at an end perhaps, Wrek. :P
<Davie_Jones> I just saw DJ-PON3
<Lasharus> (Next week, thank god. I need a vacation...)
<Wrek> 05men aja... det är inte så svårt ordvis, bara gramattiskt.
<Lasharus> Oh, and Wrek, no offense intended with the whole correction thing. Just teasing.
<xcanox> Esperanto estas la sola lingvo la mondo.
<Wrek> 05its cool Lasharus
*kirzstryfe hides Lasharus' nun ruler
<Lasharus> I'll stick with English xcanox, thanks.
<KetaminaDianePie> L'esperanto è inutile
<Wrek> 05ill dip you in my sauce anyways
<Lasharus> My what?
<Jim> I need to learn "I do not speak *enter said language here*" in every language
<Lasharus> And your WHAT?
<KetaminaDianePie> è meglio parlare in latino allora
<Dismo> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-birthday-party-scenarios.jpg
<kirzstryfe> 1,3the ruler you pull out like an old nun when you get teachy
<Dismo> I went to the moon with Pinkie Pie
<Lasharus> ...I see.
<Jim> I switched bodies with Mayor Mare
<Lasharus> Thank you for that... flattering comparison.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:p
<KetaminaDianePie> you mean la luna?
<Davie_Jones> You don't need to do that, Jim.
<Davie_Jones> Just say "American" and they will understand
<TrixieMuffin> Languages are overated , someone needs to invent the simultaneous universal translator already
<Jim> But I'm not american!
<Ziltoid> Hai bronystate
<Lasharus> TrixieMuffin - overrated.
<Davie_Jones> They'll give you the same look of disgust ether way
<Jim> ohai Ziltoid
<Lasharus> If you're going to call out languages for being overrated, do it right. :P
<KetaminaDianePie> ciao Ziltoid
<Wrek> 05if i eve got transfered to equestria

<Jim> Lyra seems to miss being human too
<Lasharus> TrixieMuffin - I just cringed. I am going to stop listening to you now.
<Wrek> 05hmm
*Lasharus shudders.
<xcanox> Wrek: Kial vi esti en Equestria?
<Dismo> Jim! Your birthday is in 7 days?

<EspyLacopa> Pegasus, because Flight.
<Lasharus> Jim, I'm almost definitely going to forget, so I'll just say it now - happy birthday in advance. :P

<otakon> I found it on Xbox Live
<Dismo> Pound*
<otakon> I'm dling it now
<otakon> oh and no allcaps :P
<Jim> But Pund Cake was a young filly, and young fillies have sudden bursts of magic
<Ictiv> otakon: he said link not C tease!
<Wrek> 05I AM THE EXCEPTION THAT PROVES THE POINT OTAKON
<Wrek> 05NOW LINK
<KetaminaDianePie> HAY!
<Lasharus> Oh dear.
<otakon> okay
<otakon> hold on
<Lasharus> Wrek, you KNOW this is going to end badly. :P
<Wrek> 05hush Lasharus beforei double dip you in ym sauce
<TrixieMuffin> The spell wouldnt exist if Twi was the only one who could cast it , there have to be other unicorns with comparable magical abilities . Yes she's a prodigy but that doesnt mean others cant get there with work!
<Dismo> When Rarity was a filly, I believe she hovered when he horn was dragging her to the jems.
<Ictiv> What flavour is that sauce? Chilly? Salad topping?
<EspyLacopa> I'd hesitate to use Pound Cake as an example simply because of the age (as in baby)
<Lasharus> I still have no idea about this sauce, and I would prefer to remain ignorant. Hushing now.

<kirzstryfe> 1,3Twilight is best pony and has no equal
*Lasharus tacklehugs kirzstryfe.
<otakon> that's the best I can find Wrek
<ofna01> wrong kirz
<EspyLacopa> No guarantee that if you ponified yourself that you yourself would also have that level of magic.
<TrixieMuffin> No equal , but a better
<otakon> the co-op demo is apparently only on LIVE and PSN
<Wrek> 05urk surveys
<EspyLacopa> Celestia and Luna don't count, they're alicorns TrixieMuffin.
<Lasharus> Very true EspyLacopa, but I'd be happy with a modicum of magic and the ability to study it.
<Wrek> 05cant you jsut send me the danged .torrent?
<Ictiv> kirzstryfe: Technically... Discord qualifies as everything that is imaginable and also what is not. So he qualifies as a pony and Twilight's equal
<kirzstryfe> 1,3chimaera =/= components
<EspyLacopa> Discord is a Q.
<otakon> sorry Wrek
<Ictiv> Q is best Q
<otakon> that's the best I got
<Dismo> The age thing still bugs me, The mane 6, some of them HAVE parents taht we see, But they don't live with them, And They're all employed.
<Wrek> 05you said you were downloading it
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Discord, Celestia, and Luna fall under deities, not ponies
<Dismo> That*
<otakon> Wrek: on XBOX LIVE
<Ictiv> otakon: can't you send over the torrent file to him on MSN?
<Ictiv> oh
<otakon> enope
<otakon> that's the pc demo
<otakon> from Zidemia
<otakon> it's official ofc
<otakon> or at least I hope it is
<Wrek> 05probably not
<otakon> that site date is from NOv.23 of last year
<Wrek> 05cause its a bloody torrent
<otakon> hmm
<kirzstryfe> 1,3and then otakon's computer gets jacked by hacker torrent
<otakon> I'm not torrenting it
<otakon> I'm dling it on Xbox Live
<kirzstryfe> 1,3then your xbox may explode
<otakon> and I picked up Bastion for 600 points too
<kirzstryfe> 1,3but let's face it, that's a possibility anyways
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> it's a newer one though
<otakon> and I have a warranty on it
<KetaminaDianePie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgkoiFwI5eM
<Ictiv> Wrek: I did a quick google search and saw somewhere that demo comes on January 31st
<Lasharus> I can't even download torrents Wrek. :P
<Ictiv> so it should be official
<ofna01> torrents r fur noobs
<Ictiv> But I keep looking for you
<Lasharus> If I try and get caught on our network (which is likely), I can get shutdown for about a month.
<Lasharus> Not really worth it.

<KetaminaDianePie> :((( mfw i cant use piratebay cause my government blocked pirate bay a year ago
<Jim> That's aweful!
<Ictiv> Ah I take it back. Bad news Wrek: Apperently there is no official release date for PC demo whatsoever
<Davie_Jones> Everyone seen the Art of the Dress episode, right?
<Wrek> 05mhmm
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IUjtHf76wM
<Davie_Jones> What is the cutie mark on the designer supposed to be?
<Wrek> 05I'll give it 1-2 days
<Wrek> 05if there is a "leaked demo"
<Wrek> 05that works on PC
<Davie_Jones> I can't see if it's supposed to be a fan or a color.. swatch. Wahtever it's called

<KetaminaDianePie> thx otakon
<otakon> oh np
<otakon> the only problem is I thought there was a pc demo out too
<Davie_Jones> I wonder if there is a mental condition that someone can have that makes them seek out acceptance in sociaty?
<otakon> but the co-op demo only came out for xbox and Psn
<otakon> Davie_Jones: ofc
<Jim> Davie_Jones: I think it's supposed to be a fan
<KetaminaDianePie> isnt it called normal beheaviour?
<diddutz> Davie_Jones: eeup it's a fan
<Jim> Well, Davie_Jones , that is because humans are from nature very social animals, therefore we do not wish to stand out of the crowd, like herd animals
<Davie_Jones> Ah, thank you.
<Davie_Jones> Wait... what?
<Davie_Jones> Jim, what are you talking about?
<Jim> You were talking about if anyone could have a mental condition that made you want to be accepted by society
<KetaminaDianePie> normal behawwww(owww damn)
<Jim> and most people do want to be accepted, because that's what we do to survive, it's instincts
<Ictiv> ^
<Tovler> Cool, I connected to Bronystate through Adium. I'm a l33t hacker now.
<Ictiv> I love when people go on about "The difference between man and animal is that animals live on instinct"
<Ictiv> Tovler: I read that as Alduin
<otakon> well
<otakon> humans work on instinct too
<Dismo> No more eating and watching KIng Of the Hill youtube poops for me,
<Dismo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwgGfjVnvdc&feature=related
<MirrorImage> what is a man but an animal with different instincts?
<Ictiv> You'll be 1337 when you log on through the first born of the time god
<Jim> Enough talk, have at you!
<Davie_Jones> I know many humans who want to stand out in the crowd.
<otakon> but we usually use our intelligence to override our instinct
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Good morning, everypony.
<Jim> ohai Kira_Pony_Yamato
<Ictiv> Jim: Have at who?
<Jim> It was a response to MirrorImage 's Castlevania reference
<KetaminaDianePie> Moaaaarning.... wait moarning?
<Ictiv> I want my Kammerjunk...
<otakon> hiya Kira_Pony_Yamato
<MirrorImage> Jim - i made a Castlevania reference?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> So, how was the L4D2 stream last night? Did the mods make it out alive?
<Jim> "What is a man but a pile of miserable secrets"
<Jim> I might have overanalyzed it
<MirrorImage> yeah... i've never played Castlevania
<MirrorImage> might've heard that line and pulled from it a bit, but it wasn't an intentional reference
<Jim> Eek.. Did I kill the chat with my stupid remarks? :(
*Kira_Pony_Yamato considering getting a private pilot's license, if I can find another job...
<Lasharus> No, I just stopped talking.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Damn Obama...

<Jim> Haven't played L4D in a long time now
<KetaminaDianePie> i just hope im not gonna be banned for posting yt links :)
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I left about when the mods got to the extraction point, so I have no idea as to whether they made it out alive or got nommed to death
<otakon> well
<otakon> who are you talking too?
<otakon> KetaminaDianePie: your fine, if in doubt ask the mod
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> anyone that saw the L4D2 stream last night
<Sumica> 00,10That was me, trying to set it up so wrek can talk with out LS
<Jim> Youtube links are fine unless the mods have said they're not
<Jim> usualy during stream nights they don't like youtube
<Morty> omg apacalypse pony fanfic! I should write one :P
<Morty> comedy of course
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Agreed, Morty
<KetaminaDianePie> but im usually too shy to ask someone something o_o"

<MirrorImage> do it
<KetaminaDianePie> :)
<Morty> lol
<otakon> I like that idea
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> If I was any good at typing, I'd try my hand at a MLP/Gundam crossover fic.
<otakon> but it's just a pun
<MirrorImage> yeah, i know
<otakon> you should make sure you have something interesting to write about
<ofna01> why was i kiced
<otakon> just taking characters and situations and then turning them to ponies is no good

<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I still think Ponies and Gundam could work, if done correctly. But I'm not sure that I would be able to do it and make it good.

<Shizuka> 13except TONS of potions you never use
<Pyrexo> Ah, It's just i haven't seen him use Poisons yet, but he has enchanting & smithing by the Ledengary gear :) Thanks
<MirrorImage> oh alchemy... durr
<Radu> Can't you put the dog on a skateboard?
<PinkiePi> wut
<MirrorImage> the only reason i end up using alchemy is because i pick up EVERY ingredient on the roads
<Heartstrings> And launch sad skateboard off a cliff.
<Heartstrings> said*
<Radu> Why is the game even named Skyrim
<OneTrickPony> k im back
<Pyrexo> Tis my first day on BronyState :D definetly coming back for the movie night
<Radu> Welcome back
<Fazana> The world is called skyrim
<PinkiePi> cause it takes place in skyrim
<Pyrexo> Because it is based in Skyrim
<Radu> Welcome here Pyrexo c:
<Fazana> or the country zone place
<Radu> I see.
<Pyrexo> Thank you Radu ^^
<OneTrickPony> I ran out of top ramen:'(
<Heartstrings> That's a pretty lazy way to name a game...
<Radu> Gesundheit
<PinkiePi> i find alchemy boring
<Radu> After the dog gets you there, do you kill it?
<PinkiePi> so annoying to find right ingredients
<Heartstrings> XD
<Pyrexo> Buuuut the layout for all of Tamriel is there too...meaning if you were to "tcl" you could run to Morrowind
<Radu> Hmm. Dogs have excellent memory.

<Shizuka> 13what now?
<Shizuka> 13oh

<Davie_Jones> Speculation time!
<Pyrexo> Revenge of the nerds? :O heard that was great
<ScootaChicken> indeed
<Davie_Jones> Who do you think they'll pull out of their hats for the third villan?
<Pyrexo> Looking forward to it :P
<Ictiv> Now, many responsiblities sit with the position of Archmage, but spenind time to actualyl work... Not among them!
<Phase4> 21-st of october is one of the first movies i saw here
<Ictiv> This one Ictivion jsut went on adventuring
<Tovler> *http://sibsy.deviantart.com/ http://comments.deviantart.com/1/282491737/2393013904

<Tovler> …Ouch
<Everlasting_Joy> Davie_Jones Christopher Lee?
<Fazana> Not until like 10 episodes
<Pyrexo> I hope we will :( She's great and I like the voice
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02kirzStolenBySB is a silly filly :3
<Davie_Jones> Christopher Lee? Who's that?
<Ictiv> He would walk down a street? Dragon attacks city, he kills dragon. "Yay our hero!" He's smiling and all, goes into inn to have a beer after Dragon killing.... "That'll be 20 gold"
<Fazana> Noobs in their homes
<Ictiv> "Dude, I literarily saved your life a minute ago! What about a free beer"?
<Ictiv> "That'll be 20 gold... Sir"
<Pyrexo> 20 GOLD?!? For mead? Better Be Black Briar...
<Ictiv> It was indeed
<Pyrexo> Recession in Skyrim...
<Fazana> Better be the good stuff
<Ictiv> but that is not the point
<Everlasting_Joy> Davie_Jones :O. Here: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000489/
<Fazana> Argonian ale
<Phase4> after some quick googleing, i've been here sence september 17, when s2 started
<Sumica> 00,10Nice singing wrek
<Ictiv> While drinking a fantastic idea came to him!
<Ictiv> How about I find me a wife?
<Fazana> I've been a brony since 20th september :)
<Phase4> hmmm, my stream died
<Phase4> again
<ScootaChicken> brb, refreshing
<Ictiv> My house gets dusty, my robes need to be kept out of bugs' way
<Ictiv> a wife would do positively good
<Davie_Jones> Ok, we got an actor, but what will he play?
<MirrorImage> did you just summon ovakiin again?
<Everlasting_Joy> Davie_Jones I was only speculating, I doubt they have him.
<Ictiv> So he takes a little stroll down to the chapel of Mara and buys a necklace
<Pyrexo> Nah Kest is sooo delayed o.o
<Ictiv> mighty fine necklace it is too! Gold and jeweled and all around neat
<Davie_Jones> First, we had a Aliucorn who lost her way ala the Protagle Son story.
<Ictiv> So then, what does he do?
<Pyrexo> Yeah Wrek get married :D
<Pyrexo> Riften
<Pyrexo> Beat him to it :D
<Sumica> 00,10yeah I am sure it is
<ScootaChicken> why do I imagine Wrek as being an incredibly abusive husband...
<Davie_Jones> Second, we had the embodiment of Chaos in direct controdiction to the Elements of Harmony which if this was a story towards boys or even teens would be a recuring villan.
<Ictiv> Well first he goes into a dungeon filled with a couplle hundered undead, gets covered in rigor mortis then crawls out
<Sumica> 00,10multytasking and all
<ScootaChicken> probably because I've always assumed he looks like the ROSMT guy
<Davie_Jones> So third......
<Ictiv> He dusts himself down just fine becasue what is a little undead flesh for an arch mage, am I right?
<Pyrexo> Don't Breylna Maron -.- She likes me...
<Pyrexo> Don't marry
<Phase4> ohai Sumica
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi
