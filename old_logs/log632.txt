<Kawaii_icybeauti> sagas: NFL is better@
<PONY> Okay... Enough for me. Good night
<CrimsonPhoenix> THIS VIDEO
<Quick_Thinker> when i was about 5 years old my neighbor invited to see a movie called Dawn of the Dead over at his house with his buds (i was not very social at the time so it SOUNDED AWESOME) after we started it i asked why its called that and he said it has Zombies and i asked "whats a zombie?" and he said just watch it so i did. After that i had TO WALK AN ENTIRE MILE HOME IN PITCH BLACK DARKNESS... i was making up excuses
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: yeah but there seems to be an excessive amount of video nuking lately, they might be doing some cleaning up
<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle: I swear, zombie killing spread are fun in a dream :D
<OohShiny> dis music is... rather familiar
<BronyInstrumental> i must stay awake, i wanna catch gigabit's show :)

<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: i thought maybe the adsmins were doing the clean ups and searches themselves, idk tho
<Kawaii_icybeauti> faliure doesn't really scare me too much...
<PONY> Failure is not a factory installed option.
<Sumica> 00,10admins dont do any investagative work
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kawaii_icybeauti, but this is RD we're speaking
<Quick_Thinker> what sucks about failure is its bound to happen
<Kawaii_icybeauti> CrimsonPhoenix: Of course.
<Sumica> 00,10they just look in to reports
<PONY> There for, failure is unacceptable.
<Quick_Thinker> im what they call a perfectionist
<shibaru> Bunny Must Die
<Quick_Thinker> and its a bitch to fail
<twilight_sprinkle> MadSurge: the one good thing about those 3 years of nightmares is that it gave me lucid dreaming, which was fun after the nightmare ended, i could even wake up at will :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> Chills
<CrimsonPhoenix> everytime
<sagas> Kawaii_icybeauti: Never!
<Quick_Thinker> for me at least
<OohShiny> why this reminds me of anime?
<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<BronyInstrumental> if i was a perfectionist, i woulda died by now. i fail publicly....all the time :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> THIS is a great example of a good PMV
<twilight_sprinkle> MadSurge: i actually ended the nightmare streak by using lucid dreaming in the nightmare :P
<Cades> does it involve killing bunnies?
<DerpyMuffins> Rainbow-creption

<PONY> Unaacceptable, you fail, you repeat, you keep doing what ever it is until death. If it is irrepearable, you replace it.

<Barbetos> Cypresswolf if we go to 6th street we have to make it to a showing of Master Pancake Theater Saturday night with Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie. If we can get an army of bronies to go, it will make the drinking game that much more epic. Imagine it, we could get a pony related word to use as the drinking game phrase. It would be awesome!
<FusRohYAY_87> Only the Admin, master of all Chatrooms could save it
<Barbetos> Sorry for text wall
<Franek12354> Adblock rulez!?

<CrimsonPhoenix> so where is Slendy anyway?
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: He'll start teleporting, as you collect more pages.
<Polydunami> Oh my
<Petrified_Discord> And in that bog there was a Slenderman.
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: If you stare at him too long, the game is over.

<oni_link> Daygon: lmao what :D
<Petrified_Discord> Daygon: And Splendorman
<Polydunami> So what, do you become insane?
<HoodyNinja> Rap isn't all "I be up in da club smoking chemically altered marijuana plants with my female dogs and my gardening tools"
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: well certainly nothing poetic about the lyrics, even if it could technically be classified as poetry...i just generally classify it as saying stupid things with a beat
<Daygon> THIS SONG IS MY JAM
<MaxTheBrony> allright leaving now for real, no need to ping me , see y'all tomorrow :)
*Daygon dances like a boss
<Rommulus> I believe when you collect 8 pages you have to escape from the foresty thing however I have been told you just die

<Polydunami> Yeah, the audio and video have desynchronized for me :S
<Wirisme> I was 3 :D
<JESmith71> Silver_Spoon: The AI cheats on all of them...well maybe except for MK 64 where they can't use Blue Shells
<TheRandomkid321> Dem sexy bucking graphics...
<Silver_Spoon> JESmith71: this is true

<cachi01|phone> back in the day.. Where i didnt existed
<Klumzeedragon> c-c-c-c-combo breaker.
<NullRadix> spent HOURS trying to get a perfect rainbow road run on time trial
<Silver_Spoon> NullRadix: only hours?
<Polydunami> I was maybe two years of age when this game was first released :P
*Sketch_Toku_Brony is playing 3d Land while watchin Mario Kart
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Isnt this the mario kart game with the uber cheating ai?
<NullRadix> *shrug* at least a day
<cachi01|phone> I was born in 1998 so........fuck........
<Polydunami> I still have the original cartridge :3
<NullRadix> not sure if days though
<Silver_Spoon> SpadeMagnes[R]: yes, yes it is
<Silver_Spoon> but they -all- do it
<NullRadix> HOP!! SPAM HOP TO TURN BETTER
<Polydunami> Hey I hear if you eat Toadstool's mushrooms, you lose weight :3
<Silver_Spoon> lol bowser
<SpadeMagnes[R]> God damn bowser
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You suck
<JESmith71> Silver_Spoon: Well they don't really cheat in 64 since they don't shoot Red Shells or use any of the hardcore items
<cachi01|phone> Bowser XDDD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Poor luigi
<Polydunami> Whoa that was close
<AJIsAwesome> That was close........
<Klumzeedragon> Dat Comeback. Hot Damn.
<JESmith71> 64's the easiest Mario Kart because of that
<Silver_Spoon> JESmith71: wasn't there still some rubber-banding going on?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And those two dont even finish
<TheRandomkid321> dat buffer
<cachi01|phone> JESmith71 they are a pain in the ass in MK wii and 7
<AJIsAwesome> I always found DD to be the easiest.
<sub06905> its all about double dash <3
<AJIsAwesome> I honestly like DD over 64, IMO.
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: There is no buffer.
<cachi01|phone> DS was the easiest
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Which rainbow road is the hardest?
<shibaru> Drawing Fate without his hat on... he looks so different...
<cachi01|phone> DD was not so easy
<Silver_Spoon> this one >_>
<Polydunami> Also, Mario Kart 64 is the only game in the MK series to have its special cup stages available from the start. :P
<cachi01|phone> Spade this one
<AJIsAwesome> And I played the HECK out of 64.
<sub06905> dem bucking flying blueshells -.-
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its fucking hard to drift in that one in 7
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also you know whats a bad idea to do in that stage in 7?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Get the drifting boost
*AJIsAwesome still needs to get MK 7...........
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You fly right off
<Silver_Spoon> ah, the feather. so semi-useless
<sub06905> how about mk ds

<SpadeMagnes[R]> I got a blue shell in my first mushroom 50cc track
<cachi01|phone> U R ABOUT TO WIN THE FUCKING RACE
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It was the first track I did when I first got it
<cachi01|phone> AND SUDDENLY SOMEONE GETS THE BLUE FUCKER
<JESmith71> I flipped someone out taking the shortcut once against someone who didn't know about it. He was like "What the...!?" and everyone in the room laughed
<Silver_Spoon> I remember rage quitting any time I didn't do it perfectly
<Silver_Spoon> ah...my youth
<AJIsAwesome> JESmith71: What shortcut?
<Therapist> I am bored
<Silver_Spoon> ...but I'm totally just a filly...yeah >_>
<Therapist> help me
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What MK games had the blue shells that could hit everyone?
<sub06905> 64
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: 64.
<JESmith71> AJIsAwesome: That one that SB just did where he used the feather to jump over that pit
<AJIsAwesome> JESmith71: Oh yeah, that one.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Didnt 7 do it too?
<cachi01|phone> No seriously...... Dafuq bowser xd
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: THat shell was BROKEN.
<cachi01|phone> Spade nope

<SpadeMagnes[R]> YOU LAPPED HIM
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Just lapped Bowser :3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> YOU FUCKING SUCK BOWSER
<twilight_sprinkle> wow bowser is bad at this :D
<JESmith71> AJIsAwesome: It's even more broken in the later games since it takes your items away
<Silver_Spoon> nothing quite like lapping someone in star cup :3
<AJIsAwesome> Bowser, close your mouth! You'll catch flies.......
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I have to say this
<Klumzeedragon> Bowser failed at his own castle...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> the 7 item is a clusterfuck
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It causes so much chaos
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: How?
<BerryPunch> Tom kick Phase4| 13,15testing colours
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You get 7 items at once
<cachi01|phone> 7 item is kinda useless........
<XAX> lolwut
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: 7 items?!:O
<Tom_Rock> can someone make me not-bored?
<Klumzeedragon> Those colours. X.x
<Cades> fml it didnt work -_-
<sub06905> the bot it talks :o
<cachi01|phone> Wait.... DID BERRY PUNCH TALKED?
<Tom_Rock> ples
<SpadeMagnes[R]> A red shell, a green shell, a star, a bomb, a blooper, a mushtoom
<Sumica> 00,10ow phase
<Silver_Spoon> Hi BerryPunch
<NullRadix> The 7 item was like... item roulette. you get a BUNCH of items that rotate around you
<Silver_Spoon> wanna hang out?
<d3rb> we must give sacrafice to the bot so it doesntr kick us
<NullRadix> you "use" whicehver is in front of you when you hit the item again
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And other players can steal the items
<TheRandomkid321> I think my heart stopped....
<NullRadix> and yeah, people can just run into the items
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: WOw.............
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You can actually steal the star and mushrooms
<cachi01|phone> 7 item was.... Bad
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It is a clusterfuck
<HoodyNinja> I return to nes mariokart?
<NullRadix> HoodyNinja: SNES
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: But at least it helps you overlap people.........
<HoodyNinja> Me gusta
<TheRandomkid321> I hink this game was trying to be ahead of it's time.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also nothing is more humiliating than getting hit by a blue shell and when your about speed up get hit by a bullet bill
<cachi01|phone> Oh hey. I remember this track from double dash :)
<shibaru> Maybe you need to get something replaced?
<d3rb> im gonna say it, no one will agree but i think its the truth, crash team racing was better than mario kart 64

*HoodyNinja would always win with bowser
<Silver_Spoon> The way the AI chooses the loser is based entirely on what *you* pick
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its sad I abused the Maku Wuhu glitch to get the very best time trial online
<Polydunami> What the hell!?
<Silver_Spoon> pick bowser: mario is prolly gonna be the "champion"
<shibaru> My desktop was having a lot of BSOD's and random shutdowns and everyone thought I had a virus, but then I took it to school and someone looked at it and told me there weren't enough... pins? and I needed a new power supply and motherboard
<cachi01|phone> http://chzvideogames.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/video-game-memes-blues-shells-are-the-bane-of-my-existence.jpg fucking blue shells
<Silver_Spoon> with toad or koopa being the loser
<Polydunami> Didn't know Toad could sprout a vine out of a champagne bottle O_O
<HoodyNinja> cachi01|phone: yes
<Tom_Rock> Leastfavorite Mario char?

<Tom_Rock> Daisy
<TheRandomkid321> wii everywhere
<Wirisme> sm64!
<Tom_Rock> Daisy gives me cancer
<shibaru> I think he meant the connections from the power supply to the motherboard? I dunno
<Klumzeedragon> All the games!
<NullRadix> I have a sudden urge to own a blue shell plushy. and throw it at people
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Hi I'm Daisy
<AJIsAwesome> Daisy really needs to be in a non-party game...............
<Silver_Spoon> Least? prolly larry
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Daisy with the power of devils
<Silver_Spoon> http://www.mariowiki.com/Larry_Koopa
<SpadeMagnes[R]> No one will get my reference I bet..
<Derpy_Hooves> NullRadix: me and some of my co-workers threw angry birds plushies at eachother
<XylemTube> Those eggs have hitboxes the size of garbage trucks
<Tom_Rock> & hate hammer bros
<NullRadix> meh... angry birds
<Tom_Rock> not really chars tho
<Silver_Spoon> SpadeMagnes[R]: pick a mario sprts game, any sports game
<Polydunami> I'd say my least favourite Mario character is Bowser Jr.
<cachi01|phone> Spade she was in the movies <_<
<Tom_Rock> tennis
<Tom_Rock> n64
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I wonder if you can avoid a blue shell at all
<Tom_Rock> no
<twilight_sprinkle> there are better games of the same genre than angry birds
<AJIsAwesome> I prefer Power Tennis over 64 tennis.
<NullRadix> SpadeMagnes[R]: you can in 7 if you have perfect timing and a mushroom
<Tom_Rock> unless you 300cc hex edit
<Cades> i dont think its that, it was working fine earlier today. my computer was being retarded to i restarted it, and every time i try to go on, it freezes at the desktop lol
<TheRandomkid321> SpadeMagnes[R] I once did.
<twilight_sprinkle> i prefer real tennis :D
<Tom_Rock> I did
<Silver_Spoon> SpadeMagnes[R]: Do you have god-like reflexes? then yes you can
<Cades> it only works in safe mode, but safe mode it retarded
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So you can but you have to be fucking precise
<Silver_Spoon> luck works, too
<twilight_sprinkle> oh and Federer is best tennis player of all time. REMEMBER THAT
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Use a mushroom when it pauss to go down.
<Tom_Rock> or 300 cc
<cachi01|phone> Angry birds is a piece of shit
<DerpDash> twilight_sprinkle: +1 for Reality
<Tom_Rock> OR 30- CC

*emangamer knows not to ask dark about that
<HoodyNinja> but then i'd need to unlock all the characters again!
<Colt_Silver> Man, I need to stop hanging around kids. :|
<HoodyNinja> ugh

<AJIsAwesome> Colt_Silver: Like 20's old?
<thelonepony> i'm 15
<Wirisme> btw i'm 23
<Colt_Silver> Use the boost to get through Derps!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> im 21
<AJIsAwesome> I'm 18.
<halcyonmanny> my money is on.....mr.game&watch
<Rommulus> 16
<HoodyNinja> superretroworld: It runs games fine, just that its not a brand spanking new computer, and it does have its bugs, but i love it :)
<HoodyNinja> 14 and proud
<Colt_Silver> Wirisme: :D Finally! Someone not in gradeschool!
<superretroworld> 16
<JESmith71> I must be the oldest here...
<HoodyNinja> 13 more days till im 15
<thelonepony> turning 16 in 3 months
<SpeedyBolt> I turn 200 in a few days
<emangamer> why do people give a fuck how old you are?
<Wirisme> apparently brony study is full of crap - average age of 21 my hoof
<superretroworld> HoodyNinja: well thats good, mines my acer, terrible mistake
<Rommulus> octo 31 I will be 17 excited
<SpeedyBolt> Age groups tend to get along better,
<emangamer> SpeedyBolt: thinking in non-base 10...I like you already
<d3rb> ugh, dont bring up age, i feel old now
<HoodyNinja> emangamer: Nobody does, we just like to feel seen
<Colt_Silver> Sketch_Toku_Brony: is it just me, or is your name some sort of convoluted Neopets reference?
<JESmith71> I'm 30
<Athgaar4> superretroworld: well the older ones push it further up than we drag it down
<SpeedyBolt> HEY d3rb, HOW OLD ARE YOU?
<d3rb> 24
<SpeedyBolt> You're not old :<
<d3rb> im not getting younger
<Colt_Silver> emangamer: I got nothing against the younger people in chat, its just nice knowing Im around people my own age for a change you know?
<Wirisme> I just feel really old in this chat lol
<HoodyNinja> Hot, steamy game and watch on game and watch action!
<emangamer> Colt_Silver: I never said you did, but what I'm asking is, why the hell it matters
<SpeedyBolt> He hates ALL the young ones.
<Athgaar4> why only mr game and watch
<superretroworld> Athgaar4: what do you mean?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Colt_Silver no lol im kinda suprised thats still going on :D
<emangamer> I remember seeing an 8 year old in here, and while she was, everyone watched their fucking tongue around her
<HoodyNinja> emangamer: I must've not been in here lol
<SpeedyBolt> TENTACLES
<Colt_Silver> emangamer: Well theres this connection thing. Its awkward trying to socialize with people young enough to be your own kids for example.
<HoodyNinja> I would have said as many words as i know
<emangamer> Colt_Silver: not really
<Colt_Silver> emangamer: Well i guess you have to be there.
<emangamer> Colt_Silver: so you cant connect to people when you're 80?
<SpeedyBolt> I dont think people here have kids at the age of...20-30
<Colt_Silver> emangamer: Not what I meant.
<Colt_Silver> SpeedyBolt: youd be surprised.
<Athgaar4> superretroworld: the younger ones that make up the majority are teenage, 3-8 years below 21, but the older ones can be older than 29
<HoodyNinja> emangamer: Not when all we are is just a bunch of floating texts, then you can imagine your talking to anyone, but irl its better to hang around your own age
<Gamefreak324> guess who's back
<d3rb> SpeedyBolt, i got a mate my age with 3 kids
<Gamefreak324> back again
<d3rb> 3!!!
<SpeedyBolt> Oh my
<HoodyNinja> Gamefreak324: NOT YOU MUTHAFUCKA!
<emangamer> HoodyNinja: that is a falsehood
<Gamefreak324> gamefreak's back
<SpeedyBolt> So I WAS wrong.
<Gamefreak324> tell a friend
<Colt_Silver> HoodyNinja: I concur.
<d3rb> one of them is 5 or 6! what the hell!?
<Vordox> XD
<SpeedyBolt> MORE TENTACLES
<Vordox> That counter
<Gamefreak324> *breaks down in epic rap*
<Derpy_Hooves> :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02fuuuuuu
<Derpy_Hooves> gg
<Athgaar4> also
<SuperBrony64> 11,02gg :)
<HoodyNinja> emangamer: Im speaking genrally here, I get along with all age groups, but thats just me
<superretroworld> Athgaar4: to me its 13-18 teenager 19-over adult
<Athgaar4> is mr game and watch the new fox or something
<Malk> Whos Dr.Hooves?
<Gamefreak324> HoodyNinja: I don't remember you
<HoodyNinja> some people might not socialize as well as i do
<Athgaar4> superretroworld: 13-18 = 3-8 years below 21
<HoodyNinja> Gamefreak324: And that is why your not on fire right now
<emangamer> HoodyNinja: age isnt a restrictive aspect to anyone unless you see age as a limiter
<Gamefreak324> so who's streaming?
<emangamer> the only mod who actually plays Wii
<SpeedyBolt> Wub
<Colt_Silver> emangamer: I think youre kinda missing the point. But oh well, its not so important.
<Gamefreak324> HoodyNinja: you has confused gamefreaknismness
<HoodyNinja> emangamer: Its not specifically age, more like a maturity aspect
<HoodyNinja> As in, how mature someone thinks you are or how mature they are
<Ponies47> Moo ^.^
<Athgaar4> superretroworld: what I meant is that the ones younger than the average of 21 aren't younger by as many years as the ones over 21 are older
<superretroworld> emangamer: then who was playing skylanders a few months ago?
<HoodyNinja> HAX
<Colt_Silver> SBG4 ripping it up with the trashtalk!
<SpeedyBolt> Dat cheap Ray Gun kill
<Klumzeedragon> Mooo~
<emangamer> HoodyNinja: everyone likes to act immature
<Rommulus> nice save
<sub06905> SuperBrony64: friend code? :3
<HoodyNinja> ded
<SpeedyBolt> If you acted mature, nobody would really like you.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol ya want coffee or milk? EITHER
<Athgaar4> superretroworld: so even though there are fewer older than 21, each one can contribute more to dragging the average up because they can be further from it
<emangamer> superretroworld: Dunno, but unless a new mod has joined, I think if you see a wii game, it's safe to assume it's SB
<Colt_Silver> Derps ftw! XD
<sub06905> ded
<Gamefreak324> lol i wanna play
<HoodyNinja> emangamer: that would mean everyone is still a kid, and we can all get along
<superretroworld> Athgaar4: yeah you got a point
<Gamefreak324> who missed me!!!!!!!!
<Gamefreak324> ?
<emangamer> HoodyNinja: we can, but some people are just stuck up egotistical jerks
<Colt_Silver> Anyways, the oldest guys here are 21-23. Who said they were that old again?
<emangamer> Gamefreak324: who are you
<HoodyNinja> curry=hax
<Athgaar4> items=hax
<JESmith71> Colt_Silver: I'm 30
<HoodyNinja> items make the game fun
<Athgaar4> not(no items, fox only, final destination) = hax

<HoodyNinja> Vordox: Dats. Wut. She. Said.
*emangamer is still mad as SB for never playing xbox with him
<TheRandomkid321> SuperBrony64 If you do play minecraft I may join you.
<HoodyNinja> Gamefreak324: Nor do I, good sir
<Eddmario> SPOILER ALERT: The Wii's online sucks
<Klumzeedragon> I'll probably play some TF2 if we don't do Minecraft. :P
<Rommulus> minecraft on pc or xbox?
<Athgaar10> I've had this problem before, is it a known problem and how do I get around it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02emangamer: I'll play :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Crab Battle!
<HoodyNinja> hello
<Phase4> o_O
<HoodyNinja> HAX
<emangamer> SB, it's too late, I dont have my xbox
<SpeedyBolt> LATIAS
<Phase4> what problem
<Phase4> also your here twice
<Phase4> nvm
<Colt_Silver> Pokemans up in this humpybump can you dig it?!
<Eddmario> SuperBrony64: Should have gone Kirby
<NocturnalBlade> morning everypony
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol if only ya got Shadow Moses and did the cdec :D
<Gamefreak324> HoodyNinja: but what about when i first join..... fuck it
<Rommulus> Hi NocturnalBlade
<SpeedyBolt> Forget Kirby
<Athgaar10> trying to say anything in chat disconnects me
<Colt_Silver> SuperBrony64: Dude you gotta play ness. Like you gotta.
<SpeedyBolt> Ness is where its at.
<Athgaar10> it's stopped happening now for some reason
<Eddmario> Derpy's jacking off in SuperBrony64's face
<TheRandomkid321> Eddmario Dafaq?
<emangamer> Eddmario: ....what the fuck?
<HoodyNinja> snake is the most annoying bot
<SpeedyBolt> Actually, he shouldve picked the Ice Climbers.
<HoodyNinja> ^
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Eddmario: Watch the language please
<emangamer> 6
<Colt_Silver> SpeedyBolt: No man, Olimar's where its at. <_<
<emangamer> ^
<Eddmario> SpeedyBolt: But SuperBrony64's not sexist...
<SpeedyBolt> >Olimar
<Athgaar10> was I just kicked/banned or something
<SpeedyBolt> Please, Jigglypuff.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02If you wouldn't dare say it in public, then it's not welcome here.
<HoodyNinja> SuperBrony64: I would say anything in public
<Colt_Silver> SuperBrony64: Challenge. ACCEPTED>
<HoodyNinja> anything
<Colt_Silver> SuperBrony64: I LOVE MY LITTLE PONIES!
<Colt_Silver> SuperBrony64: HA, hows THAT for not daring to say in public?
<Eddmario> SuperBrony64: If I can say it around my dad without getting in trouble, then can I say it here?
<HoodyNinja> MICHEAL JACKSON RAPED ME WHEN I WAS SEVEN!
<emangamer> SB, thats not a particularly wise rule. some poeple would say anything in public. maybe face to face with a little child?
<Athgaar10> and some people would say nothing in public. it's a guideline, not a rule
<SpeedyBolt> Hey kid, I ***** to Applejack.
<Gamefreak324> HoodyNinja: omg u tooo??????
<SpeedyBolt> ...Would you really say that to an innocent mind?
<HoodyNinja> Gamefreak324: IKR!?
<Colt_Silver> Well this went down the gutter rather quickly.
<Gamefreak324> HoodyNinja: time for sex
*emangamer remembers a tiem where SpeedyBolt would have gotten kicked for that
<HoodyNinja> SpeedyBolt: Do i know the kid?
<SpeedyBolt> No.
<Eddmario> Colt_Silver: It's BronyState. It IS the gutter...
<TheRandomkid321> If Wrek was here....
<HoodyNinja> Then probably
<Athgaar10> he'd probably start drawing
<SpeedyBolt> Wrek would murder us all.
<Colt_Silver> SuperBrony64: *sigh*, could you please just play using Ness so I can get out of here. :/
<Eddmario> TheRandomkid321: Wrek IS here
<HoodyNinja> Well, it all depends on who im saying the stuff too
<TheRandomkid321> Eddmrio really?
<Eddmario> Colt_Silver: NOBODY uses Ness...
<emangamer> Colt_Silver: can you please just quit bugging him and let him do what the fuck he wants
<Colt_Silver> Eddmario: I use Ness.
<SpeedyBolt> I DO
<Eddmario> TheRandomkid321: See the names on the side?
<Rain> thank you emangamer
<TheRandomkid321> I do wish people would just stop spamming.
<HoodyNinja> Eddmario: My friend will kill EVERYONE with ness
*emangamer hugs Rain <3
<TheRandomkid321> Eddmario I thought the mods names where always there
<Eddmario> HoodyNinja: Impossible. Ness sucks.
<Colt_Silver> Ness is awesome.
<SpeedyBolt> Ness is better than you.
<Rain> no, they are not there when the mods are not on
<HoodyNinja> Eddmario: BULLshit he abuses ness, and beats me almost every. single. time
<SpeedyBolt> Personally, i'd beat anybody with Ness, Lucas, Ice Climbers, and Peach.
<Eddmario> HoodyNinja: You suck then.
<SpeedyBolt> Dont ask why I use Peach, just dont.
<Colt_Silver> SpeedyBolt: How about Meta-knight?
<emangamer> SpeedyBolt: personally, I'd quit bragging so much if I were you
<SpeedyBolt> I dont like Meta Knight, really.
<Colt_Silver> emangamer: calm down buddy.
<SpeedyBolt> Well, I love him, but I dont use him often.
<Colt_Silver> SpeedyBolt: apparently hes banned from tourneys cuz hes OPed as Superman after sunbathing.
<emangamer> Colt_Silver: I dont know you...why are you calling me buddy?
<SpeedyBolt> SNAKE SNAKE SNAAAAAAAAAKE
<HoodyNinja> Ice Climbers, either Link, Pikachu, Peach, Bowser, Ike, Marth, Lucario, Mr. GamenWatch are about all im good with
<SpeedyBolt> YOUR TAUNT, IS, ANNOYIIIIIING
<Eddmario> SpeedyBolt: Because you can time the camera at the right time?
<Colt_Silver> That Snake AI is good..
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> *MGS2 Colonel voice* Good work Raide- I mean Snake :D
<SpeedyBolt> Everything is better during online matches
<Eddmario> Colt_Silver: I don't think it's an AI...
<Colt_Silver> Eddmario: ooooh. Ya.
<HoodyNinja> Kirby as well
<HoodyNinja> kirby is OP as fuck
<SpeedyBolt> Kirby is OP?
<Eddmario> SuperBrony64: Next match you should try and do Snake's secret taunts
<Colt_Silver> HoodyNinja: kirby is OP? really?
<Rain> To everyone complaining about what is on the stream: Shut the fuck up, or leave.
<HoodyNinja> When I used him
<SpeedyBolt> People are complaining?
<HoodyNinja> Im not
<emangamer> Rain ^
<Athgaar11> a
<Polydunami> Oh my, I didn't know people were complaining :S
<SpeedyBolt> Jesus I was in a coma-
<SpeedyBolt> OH GOD ENTEI
<Eddmario> SpeedyBolt: Unlimited flight, and has pretty much everyone's power attack? Definatly OP, which is why he's so fun to use.
<Athgaar11> awesome I didn't disconnect again
<Eddmario> Poly's on!
<Colt_Silver> Eddmario: Falcawn pawnch spam ftw
<HoodyNinja> Eddmario: No, Pit is unlimited flight
<SpeedyBolt> 3 1 2
<SpeedyBolt> WHO SHALL WIN?
<Polydunami> Eddmario's on O_O
<Ninjazz> Just the regular spam about how stream isn't ponies or something related to it.
<Eddmario> HoodyNinja: Nope, Pit is NOT
<emangamer> thirty-two is number one
<HoodyNinja> Which reminds me, i kill everyone with Pit
<Ninjazz> Or what they want.
<Eddmario> Polydunami: Did you catch the new Doctor Who episode?
<Rain> exactly, Ninjazz
<Rain> and they need to shut up or leave
<Colt_Silver> So SuperBrony64, how about some Ness gameplay?
<Derpy_Hooves> damn....
<Polydunami> I didn't really care to :P
<HoodyNinja> Eddmario: As many jumps as Kirby followed by a flight up special
<Ninjazz> Thing is, Rain, they never do. :c
<HoodyNinja> he can fly anywhere
<SpeedyBolt> Now its just SB64 and the Snake.
<Rain> Colt_Silver, shut up and just let him do as he wants. :v
<Eddmario> I'm usually really good with Kirby, but becuase I hadn't played in MONTHS I'm rusty as fuck.
<emangamer> OMG why is a site called Bronystate not playing ponies 24/7 despite having tried that once and it getting really old quick???? I'm just gunna complain for the next 2 hours
<Eddmario> I've seen enough hentai...
<SpeedyBolt> and SB64 is the winner.
<Derpy_Hooves> gg
<Colt_Silver> Rain: Theres no harm in asking. :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02gg :)
<sub06905> gg
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Snake? Snake?! SNAAAAKE!! :D
<Polydunami> Oh nuts
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'll play one quick one more for Colt_Silver >>
<Rain> no there isnt, Colt_Silver. but you are not asking. you are spamming.
<RainbowDash90> ..
<SpeedyBolt> It's not really spamming.
<Colt_Silver> SuperBrony64: ;~; I love you bro.
<Eddmario> SuperBrony64: Go after someone's secret taunt next match.
*HoodyNinja chews on RainbowDash90's hair
<SpeedyBolt> Hair nomming?
<Athgaar11> isn't that a disorder
<HoodyNinja> SpeedyBolt: I DON'T HAVE ANY FOOD
<Rain> no, SpeedyBolt, that is spamming. its continuously asking over and over and over again for the same damn thing.
<SpeedyBolt> Seems legit.
<HoodyNinja> Ive been eating hot dog buns for the past 3 days
<Eddmario> So, I ate 20 boneless wings at Buffalo Wild Wings in 1 sitting today...
<SpeedyBolt> Well, Rain, he could be doing it so obnixously annoying that we'd all be getting mad.
<Colt_Silver> SuperBrony64: XD for a second there....
<SpeedyBolt> and then rage would happen.
<Polydunami> KFC, Eddmario?
<Eddmario> WOuld have eaten more, but my dad "stole" 2 and my jaw had hurt near the end
<emangamer> SpeedyBolt: implying rage isnt already happening
<SpeedyBolt> and then there would be cake, lots of Toadstool-made cake.
<SpeedyBolt> OKAY
<Eddmario> Polydunami: Nope, Buffalo Wild Wings.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> dat music is BOOPIN'
<Polydunami> Oh :P
<Eddmario> Specifically the Sweet BBQ sauce
<Athgaar11> the rain is now bullets
<SpeedyBolt> Dad
<Eddmario> Surprisingly, their "mild" sauce isn't that mild...
<SpeedyBolt> Y u laugh so loud.
<emangamer> the tickets are now diamonds?
<Colt_Silver> What am I watching?....
<Eddmario> Although, I'm gonna get the Buffalo Chicken Wrap next time...
<Athgaar11> ponies
<emangamer> Colt_Silver: the same thing you've been watching for the past 2- minutes
<HoodyNinja> shouldve grabbed the curry
<emangamer> 20*
<Klumzeedragon> Sketch_Toku_Brony: The BOOPINEST!
<Polydunami> I go for the spice, myself :3
<Colt_Silver> emangamer: theyre just taunting though..Im so confused. :(
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ikr Klumzeedragon
<Polydunami> Polydunami enjoys spicy food very much :3
<Eddmario> Last time I tried eating 24 wings from Buffalo Wild Wings in a single sitting, I did the traditional. BIG mistake, as there's practically no meat on them.
<SpeedyBolt> It's easy to understand, Colt_Silver
<SpeedyBolt> The friendship lesson here is, be careful what you wish for.
<emangamer> Colt_Silver: well then dont beg for another round and then complain when they are actually having fun, which is what the game is about
<Klumzeedragon> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Brohoof for a fellow Groomp. :P
<HoodyNinja> SuperBrony64: HIt yourself with thunder, you turn into a missle
<SpeedyBolt> NOW STARSTORM THIS PLACE
<Colt_Silver> emangamer: I never said that. Im just wondering why they were taunting a lot.
<Eddmario> Also, if you get the Ultimate Nachos, be prepared to sit in the bathroom most of the night.
<SpeedyBolt> A price to pay for Ultimate things.
<Derpy_Hooves> gg
<SuperBrony64> 11,02gg :)
<SpeedyBolt> Nights of Bathrooms.
<Eddmario> SpeedyBolt: And hurt assholes...
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Klumzeedragon /) did ya see the Golden Eye VS? "This game is a bunch of JOHN WAYNES!" *Egoraptor* :D
<Colt_Silver> Ouch!
<SpeedyBolt> Indeed.
<HoodyNinja> And with that i must sleep, gn ponies
<Athgaar12> well, ultimate does mean last
<SpeedyBolt> Aww

<Colt_Silver> SuperBrony64: *golf clap* Good show ole bean
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moo :3

<SpeedyBolt> Holy shit

<Eddmario> THeir ultimate nachos are just tortilla chips COVERED in their chili and their queso dip. So good.
<SpeedyBolt> They will not shut the heck up.
<Athgaar12> speedybolt: who
<SpeedyBolt> No, they're dipped in Laxative.
<Eddmario> SuperBrony64: Y U NO HAVE INTERNET CHANNEL?

<Eddmario> This song can make a hot chick orgasm 20 times in 10 seconds flat
<SpeedyBolt> This oddly sounds like something that would come out of a SMG game

<Malavolent> DaringDerpy: Still, I think the original sounds better, can't really beat the british accent :3
<DaringDerpy> the entertainment market is the largest in europe and has immense purchasing power. everything is dubbed

<Prick> Wrek: gunna give er shorts? more clothing?
<Sumica> 00,10ponies XAX
<Wrek> 05Prick: need a body to follow first

<Prick> Wrek: ah wait nvm you have the prop
<AdamTheDuck> and ohai there
<Flare> I convinced my sister to watch it
<XAX> Sumica: Figured that. But was it with an episode? Art? Persuasive argument?
<Flare> Now she's unstoppable
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: You should have replied that yes you were cause they're so cutsie wootsie~ :D
<Sumica> 00,10his art
<XAX> Ah.

<Flare> hi
<AdamTheDuck> ^^
<XAX> lol
<Sumica> 00,10[03:35] <@Wrek> and basicalyl replied "and i thought they were for little girls"
<Sumica> 00,10after seeing Aj there
<pony_6916> hey, i gotta question. is the streamer using a mouse or a tablet?
<ACS13123> They so cuddly
<Rommulus> table
<Rommulus> tablet*
<ACS13123> No
<ACS13123> Hes using a table
<ACS13123> Like he said
<Prick> my folks gave me a MLP pony for my birthday last month, was suppose ta be a joke to em....but i kept it
<Sumica> 00,10and as I recall his dad is glad wrek is't drawing just guns and such any more
<XAX> :o
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Caravan Palace? <3
<Wrek> 05though he did say "did you have to take it to such an extreme when you went from guns etc?" sumi
<Wrek> 05also
<Wrek> 05this band is awesoem
<Wrek> 05you probably never heard of 'em /hipster
<Wrek> 05yes its CAravan Palace <3

<Wrek> 05but he still found it to be one extreme to the other xD
<Sumica> 00,10ah gotcha
<Sumica> 00,10so the happy middle is ponies with guns =p
<Wrek> 05so whats on stream right now could be called the equilibrium of both
<Prick> i gotta find more artist that are maybe similar to parov stelar i just love that swing with a beat
<Sumica> 00,10inb4 wrek makes another drawfriend with this one
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: I love your great taste in music. It's pretty much the same as mine. :D Ranging from the Metal, Swing, and Electronica. I have to say you're the streamer with the best musical taste. :P
<Wrek> 05Sumica: its not even shaded and is already looking fabulous
<Prick> Wrek: marvelous*
<Klumzeedragon> And everything Wrek does looks fabulous. :)

<Sumica> 00,10"do ponies have belly buttons?"
<Prick> yes
<Klumzeedragon> If Wrek drew one, then yes! :P
<Sumica> 00,10#14 Aw, man, it looks like I failed my paper again! I totally didn't fail it on purpose to get "detention"
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: I did though. ;)
<Prick> may wanna study up on Animal Anatomy
<Wrek> 05bellybutton logic: is it a mammal?
<Sumica> 00,10I bet if you get Aj done here today she will be posted up as well
<Flare> Wait How do ponies get bon in mlp?
<Flare> born*
<Accidentally_Octavia> Magic
<Flyboy> "Whenever someone calls me ugly, I get super sad and hug them, because I know how tough life is for the visually impaired."

<Sumica> 00,10oh hold on I have a link for that
<Prick> really you wanna get there, their Horses so just imagion a horse giving birth
<Accidentally_Octavia> I'd rather not XD
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica... Im afraid to know how you got a link for that. :D
<Flyboy> oh my... i've entered to a clop conversation
<Malavolent> I'm okay with this.
<Accidentally_Octavia> Funny how these things pan out...
<Flyboy> Accidentally_Octavia: IKR
<Prick> well sorry if it grosses you out, i had to learn that stuff and know it so i can successfully become a vet

<Sumica> 00,10http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZkZb589HrI
<Malavolent> Wrek: wat?
<Flyboy> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Dark_Horst> Flare: faust posted in a DA comment that they get born via good ol mammalian reproduction
<XAX> Wrek: ...mother of god
<Flare> Ok
<Buytoast> oh holy shit you've exposed us to the danger zone son
<Sumica> 00,10watch that and you will know where ponies come from
<Flare> But Rainbow dash didn't seem to have one
<Accidentally_Octavia> Wrek: Oh sweet Celestia!
<Buytoast> buckle up
<Flyboy> Sumica: i shouldnt have clicked that
<Flare> So I guess they get born somehow a little different from us
<Flyboy> Sumica: i REEEEAAALLY shouldnt have
<Sumica> 00,10go to around 4 min in
<Accidentally_Octavia> Why can't I look away from it?!
<Malavolent> Brb, deleting history.
<Dark_Horst> Flare: how would mammallian reproduction inply any difference from us? you now what ammammal is, right?
<Flare> Yes
<Flyboy> Sumica: i dont want to, but i must watch it. to prove my streangth and honor kmy fami- OH DEAR GOD WHAT ARE THEY DOING
<Flare> I'm just saying that I saw Rainbow Dash without a belly button so...
<Sumica> 00,10you know they are covered in fur right Flare?
<Flyboy> i've never hated rainbow dash but... well...
<Accidentally_Octavia> So.... Babies come from rainbows?
<Sumica> 00,10exactly
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica... Never show that to anyone... ever... again...
<Sumica> 00,10but only double rainbows
<Flare> You got a point Sumica
<Prick> if they show bellybuttons on MLP the age rating would go up
<Sumica> 00,10crash
<Prick> ^
<XAX> Sumica: That was touching and magical.
<XAX> Prick: Lol'd. True, though...
<Flyboy> that was torture
<Flyboy> yet i enjoyed it slightly
<Accidentally_Octavia> It was painful
<Flyboy> i dont know why
<Sumica> 00,10and just think that is just one ep
<Accidentally_Octavia> And normally Sweetie Belle is awesome....
<Buytoast> So does Dragon Porn Daily just go around looking for art to use in their drawfiends or do they at least need to ask
<Sumica> 00,10I have links for many many more eps
<Flyboy> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Flyboy> DONT DO IT
<Sumica> 00,10they dont ask
<Accidentally_Octavia> Buytoast: I had no idea such a website existed...
<Engi> ohlook
<Buytoast> aka equestria daily
<Sumica> 00,10they just hit up poniebooru and now derpybooru
<Buytoast> and they don't?
<Accidentally_Octavia> OH!

<Buytoast> AHAHA

<Buytoast> oh wow
<Buytoast> that's a new level of pathetic
<Klumzeedragon> I love Caravan Palace and Wrek's drawings, but I can't stay up any longer. x.X So tired.
<TheRandomkid321> I feel really depressed. Basically i'm not even sure if I am making the right decisions in life. I suddenly realise I am no more than a small puppet. Destined to die. I won't be remembered for any longer than 1 or 2 generations after I die. I wonder if I still feel entertained by MLP anymore. I look over at my MLP set I got a couple of days ago and know my father will say it's a waste of money despite the fact that he wasted
<ACS13123> o-o
<Prick> ^not reading that
<Sumica> 00,10Flyboy, he has a thing for some female dragon from the spyro games
<TheRandomkid321> Prick I never asked you to
<Buytoast> welcome to reality kid
<Flyboy> Buytoast: if someone has a hobby, its their choice of what to do with that hobby. not anyone elses. so dont hate someone for thier hobbys, whatever they do with them

<Flare> Thanks you
<Prick> well im sorry my friend i dont read paragraphs, i only read a summerized sentence or quote....or otherwise its useless knowledge
<Flare> fluttershy: Don't worry they wont bite :D
<Flyboy> Sumica: thats called economy
<Malavolent> So basically you're all bashing someone who quit school and makes money from his own website?
<ACS13123> Its not really knowledge...
<ACS13123> Its something he just wanted to say
<Buytoast> He sit's upon his Equestria Daily throne, stroking his Ring of Draconus Dildous, lusting for ultimate power
<Flyboy> Sumica: he needs money, so he can find a fun way to earn it. easy
<Sumica> 00,10it's not his website it's a blogger
<Malavolent> Huh? Eqd runs on blogger?
<Prick> Jobs...there nowhere...for now

<Flyboy> i'm seeing a lack of stockings. you dissapoint me Wrek
<Sumica> 00,10the sword is on another layer
<TheRandomkid321> You get one chanch. One mere chanch at life. Every step can mean your last one on two legs. I have come to the realisation that I have near all the information man has ever known at my fingertips. Yet I waste it looking at stuff that "entertains" me. I sit here infront of my computer. Wasting my life. I could die tomorrow and what would I have to show I ever walked this earth. A mesely gravestone that my family could probably
<Sumica> 00,10he turned the layer off to detal the glove
<Buytoast> why would you waste money on a gravestone
<Flare> TheRandomkid321 I know what you mean
<Sumica> 00,10not sure if you are quoteing or venting TheRandomkid321
<Buytoast> you could get a small rock or something with your name written on it
<Prick> so he/she remember - derp
<Prick> be remembered*
<TheRandomkid321> Sumica venting.
<Flare> I mean I for particular haven't done anything that might extend the human edge or tat's inspiring
<Buytoast> hell, get two piece of wood
<Flare> that's*
<Buytoast> and you have a cross or something
<Flyboy> http://derpy.me/sgCyi
<Malavolent> Your attitude is amazing, guys.
<Malavolent> You alway spend too much time thinking about death so you waste your life.
<Buytoast> oh hey, is this fort knox?
<flutterchu> Flyboy: um the rules are no video's during stream
<Flyboy> flutterchu: what they dont know, wont hurt them
<Hell2000> there is a german beer commercial with this song
<Flare> I'm not depressed or anything but I know that my life wont matter even if I try, all thigns will com to an end.
<Hell2000> hello
<Buytoast> i remember this song
<Prick> i spend my time watching Bronystate, hanging with friends, playing WoW or TF2, help family....i think ill die happy
<Flare> If life were a game I would've already played the story line about 1000 times
<Buytoast> these annoying little bastards back in my vidya games club spammed this song every damn meeting
<Flare> but even so I try to create new things
<Flare> So don't worry to much about it :)
<Prick> Buytoast: must be one ell of a song
<TheRandomkid321> In a few years I shall be on my own. Needing to worry about bills and my job. I am on the verge of ending my life now when I live in basic luxery. I have no skills though. I cant draw, dance, sing, play sports, do ANYTHING taht requires coordination, nd cooperate.
<Buytoast> i think they just thought the music video was LE SO RANDUM
<Klumzeedragon> Malavolent: :) I don't feel that way. I enjoy everything I do. Wether it be for friends or strangers, I put my needs last and it makes me like a decent person.
<flutterchu> i know a few contradiction's in the show itself
<Sumica> 00,10heh, trying to hide a youtube link
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, is this what has been depressing you the past few days? :/
<Buytoast> BANNU TIME?
<Prick> one way to avoid depressed death, Don't think about it just keep moving/trotting forward.
<TheRandomkid321> Sumica who was doing this?
<Hell2000> im afraid of living on my own
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck pretty much.
<Flare> Just keep in mind why you should live on forward
<Buytoast> living on your own is spectacular
<Buytoast> nobody around to bother you
<Buytoast> it's so quiet and you can have the house freezing if you want it
<Hell2000> i never get bothere in my room though ;_;
<flutterchu> TheRandomkid321: dont worry i had worse i cant even fly even tohugh i have wings
<Prick> if you let it control you, your just another fool that shot themself and not know the meaning of life...Moving Foward is you Future the past is forever gone.
<TheRandomkid321> flutterchu of for the love of god. Sorry but I would appreciate it if you pulled your head out of that fantasie realm this isnt a roleplay room.
<Malavolent> Klumzeedragon: That's the way. I don't care what happens after I die, since I won't be able to change it. I've got my goals to achive and I don't have time to waste thinking about negative stuff.
<Wrek> 05steampunk inspiration is suprisingly hard to come by
<flutterchu> TheRandomkid321: aiight *still shaking*
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, how about some steampunk MLP music? :P
<Flare> Anyway, I think Wrek has done a marvellous job so far
<Prick> bloody ell this was all a rp...boy didnt i get trolled
<TheRandomkid321> Prick what do you mean? I'm not RPing
<Prick> ...meh
<Malavolent> Prick is confused.
<Klumzeedragon> Malavolent: Exactly? Why think about the negative when it's just going to make you feel crappy. :) Getting out and just doing what I love makes me feel great. If I start to feel down or anything, the best thing that I can do is go out with music and walk through the neighboorhood. Simply, relaxing and wonderful.
<Malavolent> He hurts himself in confusion.
<Klumzeedragon> Exactly!**
<Prick> it was super effective
<Malavolent> Klumzeedragon: I completely agree with you.
<flutterchu> used confusion Prick
<Prick> is now immune to confusion
<Klumzeedragon> Pricks Prick with a prick.
<flutterchu> FINALLY THE STORM STOPPED!!!!!!!!!!!!!:$ *stop's shaking*
<Prick> hey dont used evil words
<Flare> yay
<Prick> try using it as a name
<Malavolent> Has the school already started at your place, guys?
<Hell2000> tomorrow for me
<Malavolent> Same here.
<Flyboy> 4 days for me
<Flyboy> :)
<flutterchu> Malavolent: i cant fly so i cant go to flight school
<Prick> 3rd of Sept when the children rise to learn
<TheRandomkid321> I cant help but think about how mankind, although we think of ourselfs as the strongest force on earth, are merely puppets to the force that is nature. All there needs to be is one natural desease and the whole earth could be wiped out. All our great structure would crumble. The streets would be filled with chaos, the few survivors would probably be insane cannibals, nature can and probably will destroy us eventually. We are
<Klumzeedragon> I think school has, but I didnt sign up for any college classes this semester. :P I'm more focused on trying to get a job.
<Flyboy> ENOUGH WITH THE PHILOSOPHY!
<Malavolent> Prick: Depends on where do you live. Some schools in the US start sooner/later.
<Flare> TheRandomKid321 We dicide what we do in our lives, many have forgotten that. We're just being supressed by the NORMS
<Prick> TheRandomkid321: Its best not to think about...dont worry the Reapers will be coming in the next 38,000 yrs
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, so... Zombie apocalypes? :$
<flutterchu> i wish my wings will flap someday
<Prick> Malavolent: I live up north
<Malavolent> Prick: North of the US?
<Flare> I say do whatever you want
<TheRandomkid321> AdamtheDuck I appreciate your humour but, alas, I am in no mood.
<Prick> Malavolent: ja
<Buytoast> i wonder how big the word document he's copy pasting from is
<Malavolent> Prick: So basically Canada :D
<AdamTheDuck> Ok then TheRandomkid321... I'm just usually in a cheery mood most of the time. :/
<TheRandomkid321> Buytoast I am honoured you think I am plagarising this. I truly am.
<Prick> Malavolent: close but no
<Buytoast> i didn't say you're plagarising it
<Buytoast> i said you're copy pasting from some word document
<Flare> be right back, I'm getting somthing to drink
<TheRandomkid321> Buytoast Oh, well I am not. I am merely saying what comes to my head
<Malavolent> Prick: Close enough for me. Never been that good in geography :D
<flutterchu> Flare: i can only drink sink water all that's in the frige is beer
<Prick> Wrek: i wanna see that leg prop again :)
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: Man, the way to look at it is that it's out of our hooves. We can't stop something like that if that's what decides to happen. So we deal with it when it comes. The weak will die, the strong will flourish, and those who stick together will flourish. We do what we must and we have to enjoy what we got while we have it.
<TheRandomkid321> I know you people probably see me as spamming but I am merely discussing the source of my depression that I have regretfully taken out on you for a few days.
<Prick> Wrek: very well done, do you think on making another steampunk animatronic
<Klumzeedragon> And that's all I'm saying about this. I font want to flood the wall of text anymore.
<One> HELLOOOOOO BRONYSTATE!!! Did ya miss me?
<Flare> hello one
<Flare> And I'm back as well
<Rommulus> Hello there One I dont believe we have had the pleasure of meeting until now
<Rommulus> Welcome back Flare
<Klumzeedragon> One: I haven't met you. :) But hello and welcome back!
<AdamTheDuck> Hello One
<Flare> thanks
<One> Well then, Rommulus, nice to meet you. And you too Klumzeedragon.
<Flare> I'm excited to see season 3
<TheRandomkid321> If Only I had the artistic talents wrek does. Or a similar talent. Or any talent at all.
<Rommulus> I actually thoroughly enjoy this song Wrek what is it?
<One> Wish I knew.
<flutterchu> i hate how they will have 13 episode's that are an hour long
<Prick> i am waiting patiently for that leg to finish...
<One> flutterchu, then again. ONE HOUR LONG.
<Flare> It's not that bad
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: You. Like me just have yet to find it mate. But I dont let it get to me. You shouldnt either. You'll find something someday. Just never lose sight of who you are. :)
<One> At least we have them ponies.
<Flare> I think they should feature a pony that makes chocolate
<One> Klumzeedragon: Yep. I for one have found a passion for the pianah.
<Flare> or is addicted to it :p
<One> Flare: Tense.
<Klumzeedragon> One: How long have you been playing? :)
<Rommulus> I love the sound of the piano and I have for the longest wanted to play one however I have had no such luck with finding one.
<MadSurge> Hello Bronystate! :$ I see badass AJ, viva Wrek!

<One> WELL, Klumzeedragon, about a year and a half is when I stated actually playing. I gingerly played around before that time, then realized how nice it sounds.
<Flare> Oh oh oh Is there a site where we could like, tell the staff of my little pony our ideas
<Flare> is there?
<Rommulus> Just relaxing and listening to the fantastic musical choices of Wrek.
<Wrek> 05how about some...

<Flare> Can you like do that?
<MadSurge> Prick: What else could you be? Humans? :D
<AdamTheDuck> Heavy techno ey?
<Malavolent> There is such thing as a heavy techno?
<One> *CHK CHK* Lock and Load, bronies. Here comes the Drums!
<AdamTheDuck> This will be interesting.
<Rommulus> Indeed
<Prick> MadSurge: no i am a person, but we all are Humanoids
<Wrek> 05ok got some techno queued
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: I will enjoy almost anything you play. I havent seen you play anything bad yet. :P
<Wrek> 05after that
<Wrek> 05some calssics
<One> Why do you have that name, Prick?
<Prick> One: guess
<Rommulus> I completely agree Klumzeedragon.
<One> Prick: Damn.
<Prick> maybe cuz im Lovable :3
<Rommulus> When you say classics how classical are we talking? as in Motzart and Beethoven classics?

<Klumzeedragon> One: Oh? Well that's good! Do you play shows or just play around on a personal piano?
<Prick> oh my...we can do a duet i can always get my violin
<One> Klumzeedragon: I have humongous stage fright, so I keep it to myself.
<Flare> I guess not
<Klumzeedragon> Rommulus: Im glad that I'm not the only one who loves Wreks music choices. :D
<One> PENDUMLUM!!!
<Flare> Wrek you should make like a little support for the blade
<Prick> Blood Suger?
<One> Fasten your seatbelts.
<Rommulus> I have gone full relaxation mode right now
<flutterchu> is there going to be a screamer :'( please dont http://mlp-vectorclub.deviantart.com/gallery/?set=29968919&offset=336#/d4oc6hz
<One> Must not mention tiarawhy...
<Klumzeedragon> One: Aw. As long as you have fun playing, I suppose that's all that matters. :) Sharing a talent like that is always nice though. I have a friend that plays a lot of piano.
<Prick> One: tiarawhy...im pretty sure everyone seen it
<One> Klumzeedragon. That is so nice of you.
<flutterchu> i need to leave now THANK YOU EVERYPONY
<Flare> bye
<One> Sadly, Prick.
<Prick> One: oh now you think about it...thank you One
<One> Bye, Flare.
<AdamTheDuck> Bye flutterchu
<Rommulus> Bye Flutterchu!
<Flare> not me fluttershu :)
<Flare> bye
<Rommulus> Have a good one
<One> Ohhhh...
<One> Whooops.
<Flare> If anypony needs me I'll be drawning abit myself
<TheRandomkid321> If you wonder why I have been silent I ahve been sitting here pondering. Wondering just why I was placed on this earth. If there is even a reason. What if I am in a comatised state and all this is just a dream. What if this is an afterlife. And when we die we merely move onto the next one.
<Flare> just mention my name when you need me
<One> If anyone nees me, I'll be walking into Mordor.
<Buytoast> I bet you made that name simply for that joke.
<Rommulus> One does not simply walk into Mordor
<Flare> haha :p
<One> Buytoast: Touché. Actually, I did NOT.
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: I was thinking about where I've heard this from... and now it hit me. :S
<One> Buytoast: I wanted to do "One Trick Scotsman" Buuuut. Appearently I need underscores instead.
<Wrek> 05oh? where from Klumzeedragon?
<TheRandomkid321> Klumzeedragon where?
<Prick> Wrek: ah ha! its a Rapier!
<One> Rapiers Rock.
<Rommulus> I feel like a rapier really doesnt fit in with the steampunk style however I do adore rapiers so I am torn
<One> But I think it's a cutlass.
<Klumzeedragon> Some r34 Chrysalis thing. It was on 4chans flash. X.x Just brought back the visions with that song.
<AdamTheDuck> This sort of reminds me of the Imperial Guard from Warhammer 40k
<One> Klumzee!!! WHY?! WHYYY?!
<Rommulus> XD
<Wrek> 05love this song
<AdamTheDuck> that and does anyone know what the name of that hat is called?
<Prick> Klumzeedragon: oh you mean Chrysalis with Pinkie Pie and Twilight :O oh ya that was funny
<TheRandomkid321> Is anyone getting agrivated by me posting these "walls of text" some may call them?
<One> AdamTheDuck: Officer's hat. I'm not sure if has an official name.
<TheRandomkid321> Because I can stop
<Rommulus> not really doesnt mind me I dont know about the others however
<AdamTheDuck> brb
<Klumzeedragon> One: Cause 4chan is evil and doesnt have room for proper title videos. :D And aye Prick. That's the one. :P
<GentleHeaven> Hello!
<Flare> Nice support Wrek
<Flare> looks awesome
<One> I feel like I get SWALLOWED up by text. In the vacuum. Where nopony hears me scream. That's why I wanna be a picture perfect pony.
<Rommulus> Ho GentleHeaven
<Rommulus> Hi*
<Rommulus> Oh damn One, oh damn!
<Klumzeedragon> One: That fluidity.
<Zanon> Heya everypony.
<GentleHeaven> anyone know what happened to paintchat?
<Rommulus> Hi Zanon
<Rommulus> No Idea
<Prick> we burned it
<One> Oh me!
<Flare> be right back
<GentleHeaven> oh, shame... i really liked it
<Prick> Wrek: can you tilt the blade a bit
<Rommulus> why tilt?
<Prick> if thats what ur asking
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: How long are you going to stream? Debating on sleeping and just using your streamed music as my lullabys.
<One> Shit... I have earplugs on. That bass is busting my brain. AND I LIKE IT.
<Rommulus> I am glad Wrek is streaming earlier then yesterday because for me I was up at 2am watching, thankfully now its only 9:49pm
<Prick> if you tilt a blade towards light it flickers and makes it look less fat
<Rommulus> oh I get what you mean
<One> Prick knows a thing or two about ZE MAGICKS of art.
<Prick> but i dont think you can put 3D modeling in a 2D picture
<Rommulus> Its just really the illusions of 3d
<Prick> otherwise its just fine the way it is
<Rommulus> done by the manipulation of highlights and lowlights
<Klumzeedragon> I don't have awesome speakers or headphones. Best pair of headphones I got is a $40 pair of turtle bitches. :D Don't do anything justice.
<One> WELL! *crack knuckles* I'm goin' to Omegle. Gonna do improvs and Brony hunts. CATCH ALL OF YOU LATER!!!
<Rommulus> I have $100 Turtle beaches however they are of course made for gaming so they dont have very good bass etc not good for music sadly
<Klumzeedragon> Rommulus: Lucky... It's 4:52am for me.
<Prick> i like to see thing visually ahead but i cant, i have to move it to that point to where its at, if i dont like it I move it back and redo it, but i can think ahead but not visually
<Rommulus> Ouch
<TheRandomkid321> I have been sitting here thinking and I have come to no conclusion besides what I was at at first... we are nothing... mankind is nothing... the meaning on life? Non existant... we live, we die, we rot. There is no afterlife, no second chanches. Although you have one chanch to make a temporary dent in history. Bujt it eventualy will be wiped out with the human race.
<Rommulus> you doing anything important well I guess it would be today for you so you doing anything important today?
<AdamTheDuck> You have been doing a lot of thinking lately TheRandomkid321
<AdamTheDuck> Why not sit and take a rest and enjoy life instead. :)
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck of course. It is what the human brain was created to do is it not?
*One hugs TheRandomkid321, Rommulus, Prick, Flare, Wreck, AdamTheDuck and Wrek. Bye!
*AdamTheDuck licks One
<AdamTheDuck> Why does everyone taste like a rainbow?
*Rommulus Hugs one
<Rommulus> Because Rainbows taste awesome and we are all awesome
<Wirisme> This is so cool
<One> I'll be back later.
<Rommulus> I like this song espedcially the beat
<AdamTheDuck> Bye One
<Klumzeedragon> Rommulus: Yeah. I guess thats the same thing with these. They sound fine, but they have no bass. And yeah, ouch is right. :P Cause I'll probably be woken up at 9:30am - 10am.
<Wirisme> I have no idea how you do this stuff
<Prick> another i like ta see is an illusion in a 2D photo
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck Enjoy life? Yes, I suppose one could do that. Or they could attempt to make the world a better place for the later inhabitants. We may even be able to post pone our destoned end.
<Rommulus> Geeze Klumzeadragon, I would say go to bed if it wasnt for the amazing art and music going on
<Prick> BUZZ LOOK AN ALIEN!
<Klumzeedragon> Rommulus: But no, nothing important. Chores. Maybe a beach party. And being woken up super early. I don't know what's more valuable~ :O
<Rommulus> However TheRandomKid321 why cant one enjoy ones self by making the world a better place?
<AdamTheDuck> One does enjoy refering oneself as one. :$
<Rommulus> Awesome then you are good to stay up if you want XD
<TheRandomkid321> Rommulus every time you enjoy yourself. Every second you do so. Could have a major impact on your accomplishments.
<AdamTheDuck> Dat cutie mark
<Prick> well im off to Wonderland, once Wrek finish this I might use this for my next wallpaper
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Prick, say hello to Cheshire for me
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: But if we only have one chance, then we need to make the absolute most of that chance. :) Why say "Only one chance, so fuck it." why not, "Only one chance? Fuck it, I'll do everything I can to make it worth it!". But of course you don't know if there
<Rommulus> Work and life does not have to be one giant arguise journey filled with hardships and pain take africa for example and volunteering, people volunteering to help the poor dont have to look at it as a chore or a pain they could see it as a fun adventure of helping the world and through this feel proud that they are doing so and through this feel happiness to help
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: is nothing afterwords or if it keeps going.
<Rommulus> happiness does not hinder us it makes us world harder and looking a life through such a funnel of bleakness does nothing but depress us and make us want to stay inside and craddle ourselves away from the pain
<Rommulus> Happiness is what keeps us driving forward and moving toward a better future, in science, in medicine, in art and in all other fields of life
<Rommulus> Apologies for text walls
<d3rb> i cant believe you havent been auto kicked for spam, nicely done :D
<AdamTheDuck> Sophisticated talks over the internet come rarely in this day and age. :3
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: I think you got your point across well. :)
<TheRandomkid321> I understand where you come from but what I have come across shal haunt me to my end... Mankind is nothing.... Everything we build will oneday be in ruin.... In this day of age we have created stuff to make lives longer but also inventions taht could potentialy end the world as we know it.
<Rommulus> I agree D3rb XD
<Klumzeedragon> That was for Rommulus. :P
<Wrek> 05thsi is pinkamenas themesong..
<AdamTheDuck> This is what wrek's drawing reminded me of http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb58378/warhammer40k/images/4/45/Company_Command_Squad.jpg
<AdamTheDuck> AJ would look good in a coat like that :$
*XAX opens IRC again and reads all the talk about life and happiness
<XAX> Damn it's srs in here :o
<AdamTheDuck> Internet is srs business
<AdamTheDuck> :P
<Buytoast> some kid is bitching about life and crap
<Buytoast> nothing really serious
<Jmo> ^
<XAX> I see, Buytoast.
<Flare> Back
<AdamTheDuck> and welcome back Flare
<Rommulus> I have also come across many things that have and will continue to haunt me in my dreams and in my wake if I ever let them in and give way to the sorrow and pain however I refuse to let it in and I persurvere into a better tomorrow because I know yes we have made things to make us live longer and things to kill eachother however the things that kill eachother also stop us from using them and stop others from making us use t
<Flare> thanks you
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: Aye. But you know what. That's our own damn fault. We build and we take care of what we build. When we die the next generation steps in and takes care of it as a gift, or they remove it and make something better. Progress. We keep moving forard.
*XAX trouts Jmo with a large slap!
<Flare> Please use a private party when you're discussing somthing phillosific
<Jmo> XAX
<d3rb> bronystatwe can be deep cant it?
<Flare> I really can't be bothered to awnser all of the questions nor read them :(
<AdamTheDuck> philiosofical is the word you're looking for
<Jmo> I will get SB onto you bro.
<XAX> Jmo: D:
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: But yes. Happy Pink Nightmares. :D Definitely Pinkamina material.
<Flare> I know I'm not from the U.S or U.K
<AdamTheDuck> AJ moustache?
<Flare> I live in Belgium
<XAX> Jmo: You wouldnt :o
<d3rb> oh belgium, great electronic music has come out of that country
<Flare> I guess I'm the only one who lives in Belgium
<Flare> Really?
<Rommulus> Think of it also this way, the nuclear bomb we have thousands upon thousands in the world and due to this threat we do not drop them, yes we have the fear of them but because of them there hasnt been a war for around 41 years or so now, the world is actually a better place due to that bomb and Im not saying its good that we can destroy on such a large scale I am saying because of it be have learned not to use them at all.
<d3rb> yeah really Flare
<XAX> Also Jmo, anything else to report about the Steam skin?
<Flare> Well I made a vew songs on my previous youtube account
<Flare> But it got deleted for copyright or somthing
<Flare> I made the songs myself...
<TheRandomkid321> I have come to the conclusion that with my report cards even though I try my hardest I am still failing. I believe my fate is sealed. I shall be another speck of dust on this floor we call earth. I shant be remembered by many. My fate won't be for a good cause. Not to mention if one of the other sperm was to fertalise my mothers egg they could have been much more than me.
<XAX> I'm aware of the ingame chat text not having the blue highlight, making it hard to read. I'll fix that soon. Anything else?
<Flare> I didn't even copy anything
<Jmo> XAX, I'm not using any skins. They're all broken until the community comes out of beta.
<TheRandomkid321> My corpse shall rot in the ground.
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Is that going to be a robotic Weenona?
<Rommulus> Dude, Bill gates dropped out of highschool and in 2008 and 2009 he was the richest man in the world
<XAX> Jmo: Hmm... I'm using it.
<Jmo> All your community tabs are working?
<Rommulus> Steve Jobs also dropped out of Highschool and look at what he did

<Flare> bye
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Flare
<AdamTheDuck> again
<Rommulus> Bye Flare
<AdamTheDuck> I don't know, I never really liked this band... :S
<TheRandomkid321> I shant become famouse. I shant be a scientist who discovers a cure for cancer. I shant create a time machine. I shant grant dreams.
<XAX> Jmo: ._. I'm still using the old version. Store/Library/something :|/Community
<Jmo> Ah
<Jmo> I'm using the new one lel
<XAX> I see.
<TheRandomkid321> I am a 13 year old male whos strength is rivaled by taht of a 10 year old girl.
<Rommulus> You can grant dreams because even the smallest speck of sand can become a beautiful shining pearl with time
<Rommulus> it is not the scale of what you do something it is how the simplist things can affect even one person in the biggest of ways
<pony_9419> Huh. When I left the stream yesterday this drawing was being made.
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, you have a perculiar way of talking and wide vocabulary compared to others to your generation :3
<AdamTheDuck> Glad to know not all hope is lost for humanity.
<Rommulus> such as for me on a personal scale I feel as if I will remember this moment for a very long time because of Wrek, talking with friends, listening to great music made by simple people and watching amazing art being made right infront of me
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: Everyone will rot in the ground. Some though, aren't that lucky. :/ And that's the thing, you're 13. You have so much you haven't seen or done. It can only get better from there. And you really don't know if any other sperm would have been better than you. So stop that.
<Rommulus> Strength does not = importance
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck of course. I never go on facebook because of all these people who I used to know from primary school using horrid grammar and simple words like they are 7 years of age.
<Rommulus> look at albert Einstein he was a weak man however he is remembered even to this day
<AdamTheDuck> Heil Grammar! :P
<XAX> AdamTheDuck: I was going to say I talked like that on the net when I was 13, but then I remembered I was actually a textlanguagefag :<
<Rommulus> Beethoven was not the strongest man of all time however he has been immortalised even till now
<Rommulus> Just like Motzart
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: Look at that. AdamTheDuck see's something in you. With grammar and knowledge like that, you can be a fantastic writer. :)
<Rommulus> I agree
<Rommulus> Sometimes all it takes is practice and a bit of initiative
<AdamTheDuck> and a little enjoyment.
<AdamTheDuck> Always look on the bright side of life~
<Wirisme> this is making me want to learn to draw
<Rommulus> any one of us in this chat could be the next great artist, musician, revolutionist, scientist, writer, sculptor.
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck when you know as much as I know that isn't easy.
<d3rb> it could always be worse, make the most of what you got
<Rommulus> Random do tell what is so horrifying that could cause such bleackness in ones self?
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, it isn't knowledge that makes a man, it is how persistant you can be.
<Buytoast> is mr dark and edgy still copy pasting his essay?
<d3rb> people with less than you have achived alot, no excuses, gotta just go for it
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck I am 13 and I know many MANY fact about how war is. How much suffering there is in the world.
<Rommulus> Wow that is really looking great Wrek.
<TheRandomkid321> AdamtheDuck and many other things that would haunt anyone my age.
<Rommulus> Do tell Random what are these other things
<Buytoast> oh god
<Buytoast> this is funny shit
<TheRandomkid321> Buytoast what is?
<Buytoast> you
<Buytoast> let me play you a ballad
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: Which everyone learns about eventually. :/ It's only harder for you because you're young. Pretty much you're just angsting so hard right now.
<Buytoast> CRAAAAAAWLING IIIIIIIIN MY SKIIIIIIIIIIIIN
<TheRandomkid321> Buytoast and you obviously have a limited vocabulary for you swear in a basic sentence.
*d3rb grabs a chair and popcorn
<Buytoast> oh man, mr i have a dictionary saying that my limited vocabulary means that my point is less valid
<AdamTheDuck> Nothin' wrong in being a Sweetie Belle. :/
<TheRandomkid321> Buytoast well i'm pretty sure I have supirior intellect. I do not insult people who are crying every night.
<AdamTheDuck> I can't wait for wrek to do the eyes :)
<Buytoast2> boy, i should really get that router fixed
<Rommulus> Whats wrong with the router?
<TheRandomkid321> Wya re there two Buytoasts?
<TheRandomkid321> *Why
<TheRandomkid321> *are
<Wirisme> I feel so inspired :D
<d3rb> can never have enough toast
<Buytoast2> because my connection is shitty sometimes
<Klumzeedragon> Dat shading. :) Looking great Wrek.
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek does have that effect on people Wirisme :D
<Cypresswolf> :| I still cant get into my Uru live account - Darn system doesn't recognize my name
<Rommulus> Just keep trying Cypress it will work eventually ^.^
<Rommulus> if not ive it some time and try again
<Klumzeedragon> Shake your fist at it angrily and demand it let you in cause you're great and powerful.
<AdamTheDuck> Cypresswolf: Solution: Use duct tape. :P
<TheRandomkid321> This song is making me cry :'(
<Cypresswolf> I cant remember my password for it - they cant send it to me because they have no record of my name or email
<Rommulus> ouch

<Flare> ^w^
<Rommulus> Oh well he is going through puberty, emotions run high at that point in time
<Klumzeedragon> Buytoast2 apparantly so. But everyone has a bad day now and then.

<Flare> Wait

<XAX> Buytoast2: thatfeel
<Flare> Wrek?
<Flare> Doesn't AppleJack have like a ponytail on her mane?
<Klumzeedragon> Buytoast2: You could have always sent him a link via private chat. 6_9
<Rommulus> I dont think Wrek can see the chat, just a guess though probably got sai on fullscreen
<AdamTheDuck> Flare, Yeah but wavy hair = 20% more badassness
<Flare> AdamTheDuck, you're right, just mentioning it :)
<MadSurge> Did I miss someone being moody?
<Flare> looks cool
<Rommulus> Yes
<Klumzeedragon> MadSurge: I thought you were here for some of it. :D
<MadSurge> Klumzeedragon: I'm looking at tons of other stuff :D
<Klumzeedragon> Flare: *plays with his ears* :)
<Buytoast2> TheRandomEmo was crying about life being unfair or something
<Flare> ahh
<AdamTheDuck> No not unfair, just more pointless iirc
<Wrek> 05its on a separate screen
<Flare> oh he's redoing her hair
<Wrek> 05and sometimes i cba to look right
<Rommulus> He was sad about how the world is crap at the start then went onto say how he did not think he could make a difference in the world because he is failing all his classes and that he would amount to nothing.
<Buytoast2> whatever it was
<Rommulus> Also thats pritty awesome Wrek
<Flare> yes it is
<Klumzeedragon> MadSurge: Ah makes sense then. :P
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: BIG DEAL. Life itself is pointless, so why not have some fun in the meantime? :D

<AdamTheDuck> Hello MaxTheBrony
<MadSurge> Wrek's eyes are just awesome <3
<Flare> that looks amazing Wrek :D
<Rommulus> I could of never guess Klumzeadragon<_<
<Klumzeedragon> MaxTheBrony: Howdy~ :)
<Rommulus> Hi MaxTheBrony
<Klumzeedragon> Rommulus: I just guessed! >_>
<MaxTheBrony> http://maxtheswed.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5dcsus , got any pointers on this? :P would appriciate anything.
<Klumzeedragon> MaxTheBrony: Needs more Spok.
<BronyInstrumental> Hello Everypony :)
<AdamTheDuck> Hello BronyInstrumental
<MaxTheBrony> heya BronyInstrumental
<MaxTheBrony> Spock xD?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello BronyInstrumental
<Flare> MaxTheBrony maby you should give him more then 2 legs it looks a bit two dimmencial :)
<Flare> But I like the rest
<MaxTheBrony> Ah true
<pony_304> Steampunk Ponies? nice! :D
<Rommulus> One part caught my attention Max, on the stomach I guess you can call it, there is the basic light and then the highlight ontop of that and I feel like you got it right with the basic highlight but not with that main highlight if you know what I mean
<MaxTheBrony> :o
<MaxTheBrony> hmm il try figure out what you mean :P
<Klumzeedragon> MaxTheBrony: And you may need to show the other arm coming from behind the head, otherwise it looks like he only has the one arm.
<Rommulus> Let me explain better you got the hair colour which is the darker brown then you have the light blue which is the basic highlight and then the really light blue which is the main highlight
<Rommulus> I feel like it shouldnt have the really light blue (main highlight) on the stomach if the light is coming from directly behind the centaur
<Rommulus> however having the basic highlight there is all good
<Rommulus> just my opinion
<MaxTheBrony> Ahh
<MaxTheBrony> I see waht you mean
<MaxTheBrony> what*
<MaxTheBrony> yeah that sounds reasonalbe
<Rommulus> thats all I can pick out from it
<MaxTheBrony> ble*
<MaxTheBrony> Thank you :)
<Klumzeedragon> Rommulus: .-. the lighting is on it's back.
<Jmo> Rofl MaxTheBrony

<Flare> CrimsonPhoenix what derpy animation project? What does it include?
<Rommulus> does wrek tries?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Flare, it's a bunch of mini-skit involving Derpy and her misadventure
<XAX> I think you just accidentally the whole grammar there, CrimsonPhoenix
<CrimsonPhoenix> the thing about it is that he'll be soing the whole video in pen and paper
<Flare> So basicly you could make an animation about derpy and her misadventures?
<Wrek> 05the steampunk prosthetic is growign on me

<Flare> hey Pearly
<Flare> and my manes and tail would be blue
<Pearly> Ho are you darlin?
<Midnight_Fyre> Can anyone tell me what the lottery winners yesterday were?
<Flare> oh, What's the lottery for actually?
<Vivix> The lottery was last night? I totally missed it-
<Vivix> lottery is for what movies and episodes next movienight
<Midnight_Fyre> Flare: The movies that will play
<Flare> oh ok
<Midnight_Fyre> I missed it because I went to a brony meetup yesterday
<Flare> epic she even has a cape :O
<Vivix> I only came in around midway through the euronight, 'cause I was here during us night
<Flare> The epicness is overflowing
<Vivix> but- I didn't see it
<Midnight_Fyre> I showed up at the meetup and I was the only one there aside from the guy oganizing the event
<Vivix> Awww
<Midnight_Fyre> So it was just the two of us
<Midnight_Fyre> We met at an arcade and still had plenty of fun though
<Vivix> Had fun anyway?
<Vivix> aah hehe
<Midnight_Fyre> yep
<Lil_B> So I wasn't the only one on a meetup yesteray eh? XD
<Flare> Wow
<Flare> Wrek that looks awesome
<Lil_B> I live that Steampunk leg
<Flare> So I'm not allowed to chare any kind of link right?
<Flare> :'(?
<Flare> Am I?
<Lil_B> I thought pics were allowed, but it always depends on the mods
<Flare> oh ok
<Lil_B> ... I have a stupid question :/
<Midnight_Fyre> Lil_B: I'm pretty sure pics are allowed anytime as long as they conform to the rules.
<Flare> sure
<Flare> ask away Lil_B
<Midnight_Fyre> I wonder if Wrek would kick me for linking to his own art :)
<Flare> I don't know :p
<Flare> If I were a pony
<Flare> I would look like this
<Flare> http://i.imgur.com/stOho.png
<Lil_B> I want to make a second youtube account and it says in the name "only letters, numbers and periods are allowed" , what are periods? Lack of basic knowledge here or maybe I'm just derping right now
<Sylandest> Lil_B: periods as in "."
<Flare> here comes Gods punnishment *shakes...*
<Midnight_Fyre> http://archiveit1.deviantart.com/#/d5dd0r8
<Lil_B> ok, I thought so, but when I tested it it still dodn't except it, thats what confused me
<Midnight_Fyre> Just a little something I made
<Vivix> _ and such is not allowed
<Hell2000> back from shaving my neckbeard

<CrimsonPhoenix> so why is Predator in League of Legends?
<Midnight_Fyre> Invi: Well, it's made of rock so I can't exactly color it. Actually, the pics don't do it justice. The rock looks very pretty close up
<Gamer_luna> Madsurge
<Gamer_luna> Stuff happened....
<MadSurge> Gamer_luna: bad stuff?
<Invi> Midnight_Fyre, oh ok then ^^ you could do another one and experiment around with the details like hair and eyes
<Gamer_luna> I got shot two times,lost my eye and voice in a crash AND need brain sugery...so yeah...
<MadSurge> Gamer_luna: O__O
<Midnight_Fyre> Invi: Yes, I'd like to do another. Maybe not for a while though because that took a long time and I'm pretty busy now that summer is over
<Flare> you, you did?
<Invi> Midnight_Fyre, you still have the weekends ^^
<Gamer_luna> It's been horrible.my room mate Matt died yesterday also...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gamer_luna, I am extremely sorry but I find your story hard to believe
<Midnight_Fyre> true, but i work every other weekend and i have a feeling i'll need the others to catch up on classwork
<Gamer_luna> CrimsonPhoenix: I'm alright with that,the internet is about trust.So you trust me or not :)
<Gamer_luna> It's your choice,I know it unbelieveable,I bearly believe it/
<Gamer_luna> But hey,stuff happens,right?

<MadSurge> Hey Pinkie_Brony!
<Pegasister> Pinkie_Brony Howdy.
<Pinkie_Brony> Why is it just a wheel of death?
<tSparx> *sudddenly, buffer every five sec*
<Pinkie_Brony> Pegasister: Heller
<Saturn> 08,01Pegasister: you just earned yourself a permaban
<Pinkie_Brony> Hey MadSurge !!!
<Pinkie_Brony> permaban?
<tSparx> Permaban, for what?
<Vivix> S3 spoiler YT link
<Pegasister> @Saturn; huh?
<Saturn> 08,01permanent ban for posting season 3 spoilers
<Pinkie_Brony> What is that?
<CCCP> Saturn dont do it!
<Saturn> 08,01rules are rules
<tSparx> Oh, I see... do what you think prudent
<CCCP> if some one is knew you shouldnt ban
<CCCP> new*
<Pegasister> @Saturn oh, sorry.
<Saturn> 08,01and it says clearly in the topic
<Vivix> "S3 Spoilers are not permitted. Discussion of anything related to S3 will result in a ban. "
<CCCP> Saturn just let it slide
<Unnr> Hullo all
<CCCP> hi Unnr
<Pinkie_Brony> Turn a blind eye
<Unnr> Hai CCCP
<Unnr> o/
<Vivix> he or she can appeal later, probably
<DoctoDoctorWho> let her burn saturn, let her burn
<Rex_Mundi> Hay look! Ponies in socks! http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/180/8/a/fluttershy_and_pinkie_pie_striped_by_shepherd0821-d55c2q3.jpg
<CCCP> DoctoDoctorWho thats mean
<tSparx> CCCP: On the one hand, sure, on the other hand, you should read the rules if you're new.
<killerpony7733> ^
<Vivix> not new user though
<CCCP> tSparx yeah i know, but it really wasnt somthing harmful
<Pinkie_Brony> Did Anyone even present the rules to Pegasister?
<tSparx> Oh wait, Pegasister did say she wasn't new.
<CCCP> you could of just seen the link and clicked out of it
<Rex_Mundi> I just got back here, what did Pegasister do?
<CCCP> does looking at the title of that video ruin season 3 for you?
<Unnr> Rex_Mundi: Link S3 material
<Rex_Mundi> She get kicked?
<tSparx> CCCP: She's a veteran here, and them's the rules. I again bow down to "what mods say goes"
<Vivix> rules are rules, appeal can be sent and she'll probably be back in a few days
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi, banned
<Saturn> 08,01CCCP: the rule is no s3 spolleers. that was an s3 spoiler. she should know better
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Permabanned
<GilDash> Rules are rules though. There isn't really an excuse not to know them. :S
<Pearly> morning everypony
<killerpony7733> GilDash exactly
<Unnr> Allos Pearly
<tSparx> Pearly: Mornin' Pearly :)
<Rex_Mundi> How serious of a spoiler?
<thelonepony> mornin' Pearly
<CCCP> Saturn but a perma ban is a little harsh really
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Long time no see! How're you doing? :)
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: That admittedly doesn't matter.
<DoctoDoctorWho> and the blasphemer is silenced...
<Saturn> 08,01CCCP: noits not
<Vivix> she got Appeal mail adress in the kick message, so it's not that harsh
<killerpony7733> GilDash pretty average been a tiny bit busy with school, but else i have been on lurking around and all
<Saturn> 08,01some people dont want to know anything anout s3
<Saturn> 08,01at all
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Ah, lurking. I've been busy that I've had to lurk, I'm afraid. :(
*Vivix raises hand as one of those people
<Saturn> 08,01including some mods
<tSparx> And the mods made it clear that THIS chan would involve no spoilers, at all, period
<GilDash> Same here. I abhor spoilers.
<Rex_Mundi> heh, still interested, was it like a plot summary, or was it something small?
<CCCP> Saturn cant they just get over it?
<tSparx> CCCP: Drop it.
<tSparx> CCCP: What the mods say goes
<Unnr> as killerpony7733 lurks in the night because he´s... TROGDOR!~
<Vivix> Why should we have to? It's in the rules, clearly stated as bannable
*DoctoDoctorWho raises hand with Vivix
<Pearly> all I saw for season 3 is what they presented with 2 songs, but that is is... I think season 3 will be a surprise for us all
<CCCP> okies :s
<ACS13123> HAI :)
<tSparx> CCCP: You don't have to like it, but...
<Vivix> I didn't even see the two songs, or their titles
<Pearly> but they were shown at comic con
<Rex_Mundi> Pearly: as it should be
<GilDash> Pearly: There's no reason for her to post them here though.
<killerpony7733> GilDash well i haven't been purely lurking. Been either playing games or purely just checking back and forth on the stream talking with random ponies here and there
<Pearly> Ijust can't wait for it if it is a surprise
<Saturn> 08,01CCCP: it was agreed by all the mods that s3 spoilers are a bannable offence, so its not going to change
<Vivix> I didn't want to know what the songs are about, what they sound like, who sings in them , or anything, so I avoided the EQD post, and I don't want to know anything about it even if they were on comiccon
<CCCP> Saturn i still dont agree with that rule
<Pearly> Oh I didn't post them here, I just said last time someone stopped me. I was looking for online lyrics for the orher songs
<GilDash> killerpony7733: I know what you mean. I've been busy with things elsewhere, so I can relate to that. :)
<Saturn> 08,01CCCP: well, you have the right to disagree,but rules is rules
<Pearly> I sense it will be a surprise on what is or what has not showin in s2
<Saturn> 08,01and the rule abouts3 spoilers stands
<Unnr> CCCP: Then apply as mod next time there is an open casting call. The Rules are Da Rules
<Vivix> Mods have to apply rules they don't agree with, so that wouldn't really help
<Masdragonflare> is the streaming back on?
<DoctoDoctorWho> BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE! BANNS FOR THE BAN HAMMER!
<CCCP> Unnr i could never be a mod lol
<Pearly> i they posted anything onit, they should just block those site, glad I have not seen anything about ir
<Buytoast2> did some dumbass post shit about season 3?
<GilDash> DoctoDoctorWho: That last one... is it bad I dread that most? XD
<tSparx> Mm, then I could type in purple... xD
<killerpony7733> Buytoast2 yep
<Buytoast2> ahahaha
<CCCP> Unnr i dont even know what client im using!
<Vivix> I could have the most obnoxious colours ever,
<Rex_Mundi> Pegasister did
<DoctoDoctorWho> GilDash: no, thats just common sense
<Unnr> CCCP
<Unnr> Magic?
<GilDash> DoctoDoctorWho: Good to know it's common sense to fear a ban then to worry about blood and skulls being taken from people. XD
<tSparx> I fear the Ban Hammer not; the Ban Hammer's here to protect me. As long as I stay with the mods, the mods will stay with me :$
<Masdragonflare> Is the streaming back on? :)
<CCCP> lol
<Saturn> 08,01tSparx: cometobed.png
<GilDash> tSparx: Problem is when you're not exactly best friends with the mods... :D
<tSparx> Saturn: Was?
<GilDash> Saturn: I feal a trap...
<tSparx> GilDash: I'm more than used to getting along with people I don't like :)
<GilDash> tSparx: Same here. Doesn't mean it always works in reverse though. :D
<Vivix> Yes, just because one disagrees or dislikes eachother, doesn't mean one has to pitch a fight
<CCCP> There should be a chat revolution somday
<tSparx> CCCP: I'd RP that xD
<CCCP> lol
<tSparx> Saturn: All I get when I google that is a picture of T-Sparx looking pissed off under some blankets.
<PillowPoni> Morning, guys
<tSparx> Saturn: And some sims doing naughty things
<tSparx> PillowPoni: Mornin' :D
<Masdragonflare> guys?
<Barbetos> Masdragonflare what?
<Masdragonflare> well
<Barbetos> ohhaibtw!
<Masdragonflare> I was just wondering if anyone can see the streaming?
<PillowPoni> How you doing tSparx?
<MadSurge> Hello GilDash! :D
<tSparx> Masdragonflare: There's still a stream, but man oh man can I not watch it xD
<GilDash> MadSurge: Holla! :)
<Masdragonflare> Does everypony have the same problem?
<Barbetos> Masdragonflare the exciting world of gray dots geting chased by white dots is on.
<tSparx> Masdragonflare: Too choppy on this end, buffer for 20 sec every 5 sec :/
<Barbetos> So yes.
<alexxm> jow you doing MadSurge
<tSparx> PillowPoni: I'm great, how 'bout chu?
<CCCP> jow
<Masdragonflare> alright tell me when it's back on
<Masdragonflare> I'll refresh then
<Wrek> 05dayum the prosthetic turned out good
<MadSurge> alexxm: better than the last two days
<Unnr> It is by mods alone the hammer´s set in motion. It is by power of OP that users acquire kicks, kicks acquire bans, the bans a warning. It is by mods alone the hammer´s set in motion.
<tSparx> Wrek: Aw is this a KiwiBlitz!Pony :P
<PillowPoni> tSparx : I'm doing fine. Saw that there was a ban.
<CCCP> *hugs PillowPoni*
<Jmo> Ohai PillowPoni
<Wrek> 05tSparx: what?
<tSparx> Wrek: All I can see wright now is a prosthetic limb, and I now want to see a pony based off the main char in KiwiBlitz (webcomic)
<Rex_Mundi> oh hey streem,long time no see
<tSparx> right* now
<DoctoDoctorWho> so wrek, is this 40k AppleCreed?
<Unnr> DoctoDoctorWho: Applejack would make a horrible Creed
<tSparx> PillowPoni: Yeah, sad times :/
<DoctoDoctorWho> Unnr: maybe, but dayum can she make it look good
<Wrek> 05no warhamemr here
<PillowPoni> tSparx: sad times indeed. I remember my first actual ban.
<Ravebrony> Good morning, everypony! :)
<tSparx> PillowPoni: I've only been auto-kicked for spam once.
<tSparx> Ravebrony: Hey there :)
<thelonepony> Mornin' Ravebrony :)
<tSparx> teh
<Applejack2012> Good evening
<DoctoDoctorWho> I was born with a ban, saturn had to come in and fix everything
*Ravebrony waves to tSparx, thelonepony, and Applejack2012
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/KHXhF.png
<tSparx> DoctoDoctorWho: "I... am a ma-an of constant bannage..."
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love abortion edits
<Ravebrony> o_o
<PillowPoni> tSparx: my first ban was for 24hours. Saturn was the one who banned me. :)
<CCCP> PillowPoni why were you banned?
<tSparx> PillowPoni: What'd you do, silly poni?
<Vivix> I was once banned for multiple accounts when me and my cousin lived in the same house using a reuter
<Vivix> on a forum
<CrimsonPhoenix> I've never been banned in here
<CrimsonPhoenix> MLG PRO
<pegasister96> This is my first time on here.. I feel like a noob. XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> pegasister96, read the rules, about us, FAQ and staff
<tSparx> pegasister96: So, hm, wait, let's be clear, no relation to the pegasister who was on here eariler, ja?
<CrimsonPhoenix> links are above the stream
<pegasister96> No, that wasn't me.
<PillowPoni> CCCP, tSparx: Saturn had set up a small game of Russian Roulette and I rolled a 1.
<tSparx> PillowPoni: Oh xD
<Ravebrony> Is there a stream?
<Ravebrony> Or did it go off?
<CrimsonPhoenix> PillowPoni, should've been permanant
<DoctoDoctorWho> buffer = :(
<pegasister96> I just finished browsing the top links on the page. :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause you bet your life in a Russian Roulette
<tSparx> pegasister96: We'd all appreciate it if you familiarized yourself with teh rules, but maybe the most important that you couldn't guess: 1) nothing about Ssn 3 in here, 2) no non-image links during streams
<CrimsonPhoenix> pegasister96, you've gain some of my respect points
<Unnr> tSparx: We thought you was turned into a banne´d toad.
<tSparx> pegasister96: Yay, a n00b who reads the rules!
<PillowPoni> CrimsonPhoenix: lolol I lasted a good while. About 15 minutes.
<tSparx> Unnr: Who, me?

<tSparx> pegasister96: Nah, don't worry bout it :P
<MadSurge> pegasister96: anyway, welcome aboard!
<pegasister96> I'm glad to be so cordially welcomed. :D
<Ravebrony> OH!... shoot, i had stream for about 3 seconds :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> and here I was told to give a benefit of doubt
<Derpy_Hooves> morning

<Ravebrony> Hey Derpy_Hooves!
<pegasister96> Oh, thank you tSparx. :)

<Wrek> 05large as fuck
<pegasister96> Alrighty then. ^^
<tSparx> Wrek: Sehr awesome!
<CrimsonPhoenix> aren't the ears a bit big?
<Wrek> 05you are a bit big
<alexxm> does the stream keep buffering for anyone else
<Buytoast> ban him for being a darn dirty troll
<Vivix> I like Wrek's new earstyle
<CrimsonPhoenix> Actually I'm underweight
<tSparx> alexxm: I gave up trying to watch it xD
<pegasister96> Yea, it buffers for me too. :\
<tSparx> Buytoast: You are ban-thirsty aren't ya xD
<Ravebrony> alexxm: Yeah, i get stream for about 3 seconds :D
<OneTrickPony> Wrek: that looks awesome
<MadSurge> pegasister96: so tell us, who's your favorite pony? :D
<PillowPoni> Wrek: nice Applejack. Permission to add to my favorites?
<pegasister96> I'd say Fluttershy ^^
<tSparx> lawl
<CrimsonPhoenix> You need permission to add to favorite?
<Buytoast> well, at least this time i wasn't banned for asking who rinachan is
<Saturn> 08,01who is rinachan?
<Barbetos> I dunno.
<Barbetos> Some girl
<CrimsonPhoenix> please guys
<MadSurge> pegasister96: excellent choice :D
<tSparx> Everytime I see that "Mode #bronystate +b" go up
<tSparx> My heartrate doubles :$
<GilDash> He's out of control! :O
<PillowPoni> Buytoast: how'd you get banned for asking who rinachan is?
<Saturn> 08,01you whore <3
<pegasister96> Aha, thank you MadSurge!
<Wrek> 05you lvoe it
<Barbetos> tSparx I could imagine you waking up in the middle of the night screaming becuase you ahd a dream about bronystate chat syaing your banned.
<tSparx> pegasister96: Certainly a pony or two 'round these parts that share that opinion
<Wrek> 05but yeah guise!
<Wrek> 05http://wreky.deviantart.com/art/Admiral-AppleJack-324866230
<Wrek> 05its done
<Wrek> 05commetn and fave :3
*tSparx shudders at what Barbetos suggested
<Wrek> 05probably not 56k friendly
<Vivix> damn internet
<Ravebrony> I dont think ive ever commented on Wreks work O.o
<CrimsonPhoenix> people still use 56k?
<MadSurge> ^
<Vivix> Oh I like that shading a lot more
<Barbetos> CrimsonPhoenix in texas, yes
<CrimsonPhoenix> woooow
<Derpy_Hooves> morning bronystate :3
<pegasister96> Woo, Texas! xD
<Vivix> 56K is still around
<Barbetos> The company I work for still signs up people for dial up
<CCCP> I wish Fluttershy was real...
<Vivix> so is the lack of in ternet
<Vivix> internet*
<Barbetos> We generally try to avoid it
<mitamaking> hello everygrasshopper
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can get lack of internet
<MaxTheBrony> ohai :)
*tSparx takes a deep breath of air
<pegasister96> I'm going to cosplay as a human fluttershy xD
<CrimsonPhoenix> I know people that can't afford it
<Malavolent> Evening, everybrony.
<MadSurge> pegasister96: you texan? :D
<Ravebrony> Hey Malavolent
<Applejack2012> good evening
<pegasister96> Sure am!
<tSparx> Hello MaxTheBrony mitamaking nameless pony #7007 and Malavolent
<MaxTheBrony> Heya tSparx :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> but I'm surprised there are ISP that still offers 56k
<MadSurge> pegasister96: then do you love or hate Applejack? :D
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: It's surprisingly widespread
<pegasister96> Oh God, I'd say it's more of a love-hate kind of thing. xD
<Wrek> 05CrimsonPhoenix: makes sense to me, you get lots of money for a shitty service
<Derpy_Hooves> hai wrek :3
<alexxm> how you doing Malavolent
<tSparx> Ope
<CrimsonPhoenix> Wrek not if the competitor offers a beter deal
<Malavolent> alexxm: It's K. School starts tommorow, but it's K. What about you?
<alexxm> i'm good Malavolent
<mitamaking> School should start on Tuesday
<CCCP> ITS REALLY fun to PM yourself
<Barbetos> Internet penentration in America sucks, especially in Texas.
<tSparx> mitamaking: Not if Mal's not an American
<MadSurge> pegasister96: least favorite pony?
<CCCP> MadSurge who is your favorite pony?
<mitamaking> Doesn't every where but America do year round school?
<tSparx> pegasister96: You of course shouldn't feel required to answer these if you're worried someone'll troll you for disliking their favorite pony
<tSparx> mitamaking: Also no
<Barbetos> To bad the internet did not come out around the time phones did. We would have awesome interent everywhere by now.
<tSparx> mitamaking: A lot of places do the Fall to Spring system we do
<MadSurge> CCCP: Pinkie of course :D
<mitamaking> That is a surprise
<tSparx> pegasister96: But I won't troll you for disliking my favorite pony :)
<CCCP> MadSurge wrong! the anwswer is every pony is equal
<pegasister96> Ah, I'm afraid I'd be spammed with hate. But I don't really care for Rarity. :X
<tSparx> CCCP: No, the answer is [pony(ie)]
<tSparx> (ies*)
<CCCP> D: Rarity is best pony
<mitamaking> MadSurge: Pinkie more like Stinkie, am I right? :$
<MadSurge> CCCP: she's my favorite, not the best. Everyone is best pony!:D
<CCCP> so is AJ
<Vivix> Rarity, pinkie and Fluttershy are my favourites
<MadSurge> mitamaking: more like Spittie Pie :D
<Vivix> though I love the rest, even if RD grates me sometimes
*tSparx surreptitiously high-fives pegasister96
<pegasister96> xD
<tSparx> Though I love Rarity too <3
<mitamaking> I find it so sad how well Fluttercry fits Fluttershy
<tSparx> mitamaking: But then she wrestles a BEAR
<Applejack2012> I love Rarity, and Applejack of course
<mitamaking> tSparx: Then she is scared of a butterfly
<MadSurge> pegasister96: as you can see no mane six is really hated here :D so feel free to talk about your preferences!
<pegasister96> Oh. ^^
<tSparx> mitamaking: Then she out-stares a cockatrice
<mitamaking> Well I don't like :D that much
<mitamaking> Flutter is bipolar
<CCCP> Is it weird that my 9 year old cousin thinks that My Little Pony : Friendship Is Magic is for babies, like i was watching it and she said it was for babies and stupid
<Vivix> Trassalderen
<Vivix> kids that age haate everything even slightly childish it seems
<CCCP> mitamaking Fluttershy is best pony
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai again , what are you talking about?
<tSparx> CCCP: Some kids fight kid-stuff because they wanna grow up. I was that kid :/
<mitamaking> CCCP: but also worst pony
<MadSurge> CCCP: nope, he's just a silly kid that knows no better because he still thinks girls suck :D
<Vivix> apparently me and my sister hated childrens tv at that age
<Wrek> 05there we go
<CCCP> MadSurge actually i forgot to say its a she
<Wrek> 05tail added
<mitamaking> Look at Disney, most people love it from birth to about 10 then again aroun 20 to death
<tSparx> MadSurge: she*
<Wrek> 05cant believe i forgot that one
<Wrek> 05again xD
<CCCP> mitamaking lies!
<CCCP> tSparx i guess
<Ravebrony> Wrek: Oh, haha, i was just about to ask :D
<tSparx> Fluttershy is a pony.
<mitamaking> CCCP: I present Toy Story 3 as proff
<MadSurge> CCCP: :D maybe she likes Arnold style action :D
<mitamaking> *proof
<CCCP> mitamaking wat
<Wrek> 05problem is the file is 13 Mb
<Wrek> 05take ages to upload to DA
<CCCP> maybe..
<CCCP> She reallyy like Anime
<mitamaking> Look at how many 20 year olds or so loved Toy Story 3, and look what they said about animation before then, note I am talking on majority not indivdual people
<CCCP> likes*(
<Wrek> 05fixafied: http://wreky.deviantart.com/art/Admiral-AppleJack-324866230
<mitamaking> Liking anime doens't mean you don't like ponies, I would know
<CCCP> mitamaking oh i thought you were taliknng about Fluttershy still
<tSparx> dat tail <3
<CCCP> pretty much all my friends know i like ponies now...
<MadSurge> mitamaking: I like cartoons regardless of provenience
<Vivix> I prefer western animation
<mitamaking> Me too MadSurge but I was in the minority
<MadSurge> CCCP: and what di they think of it>
<Vivix> I don't have anything against anime, but usually the story and animation don't captivate me
<tSparx> I luff Anime and Western Cartoons
<alexxm> i like both to be honest
<Wrek> 05who wanted a wallpaper version?
<tSparx> y'know what else I love?
<tSparx> Food.
<Applejack2012> I prefer Western Cartoonsa
<mitamaking> I mean look at the return of Toonami or The 90s were All That, all trying to play up on nostalgia
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: then you've been watching the wrong ones
<tSparx> I'm off to get food, later y'all!
<Vivix> Dark_Horst, maybe, I've only seen what was offered to me by anime nerds
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: i think we'd all like one
<mitamaking> I prefer Japanese cartoons, with a few exceptions(Ponies, Avatar, Word Girl)
<CCCP> MadSurge well they dont really care much, like a few of my friens really hate bronies and a few like the show a bit.. but thats all.
<Vivix> not everyone will like it, no matter how well made it is
<Applejack2012> Inb4 90s nostalgia storm
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: i think we found the reason
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> But look, even if it's rated 99/100 by people, someone will hate it
<MadSurge> ^
<tSparx|Lunch> Applejack2012: The amount of people who love the 90's but were born in like 1998 is TOO DAMN HIGH
<mitamaking> Applejack2012: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L969142tad4
*tSparx|Lunch actually goes away now
<CCCP> tSparx|Lunch lol
<Dark_Horst> i find it hard to find anime i like myself, but once in a while something pops up
<Dark_Horst> ghost in the shell for example, which has been streamed here
<Dark_Horst> love that one
<Vivix> I've seen it, but didn't quite like it, saw it here aswell
<mitamaking> anime does a lot better job covering a multitude of genres than American cartoons
<Applejack2012> I watch more Western cartoons than anime
<Vivix> of course I'm sure theres some anime out there that I might love, but I don't prefer it
<CCCP> i was born in 1996 and i dont remember the 90's i dont ever remeber any thing before 2005
<CCCP> except breaking my tooth
<Vivix> I was born in 1989, I remember the 90s, but not 90s TV
<Vivix> or well I remember Micheal Jackson being on TV, but I was too young during most of it
