<Ninjazz> So don't be an ass.
<Wrek> 05good riddance.
<Nabronyan> What?
<Mutterguy> he had it coming
<Ninjazz> Oh.
<Ninjazz> I see we lost him.
<Nabronyan> Wait
<Nabronyan> Am I getting banned?
<Nabronyan> Im confused
<Major_Frank> Why ello there
<Giger4444> not you, whoofs :D
<Ninjazz> Ah well. Should have thought a minute before typing them out.
<Nabronyan> Oh
<LucidDream> XAX O:
<LucidDream> Did you finish the cutie marks?
<XAX> LucidDream :D
<Giger4444> seeing D3 makes me want play D2. But when I think about making a new character I know I wont get past Lut Gholein :)
<XAX> *sigh* I only have Twilight's to do :(
<Nabronyan> I remember in D2 I made a necromancer
<Nabronyan> ANd had no idea what I was doing
<Major_Frank> lol.
<Wrek> 05i miss hammerdins
<Nabronyan> So I charged in with a spear along with my skeletons and golems.
<LucidDream> O: Still the most fun one though
<Nabronyan> I made playing D2 hell with my brother
<Ninjazz> Why has everyone played Diablo 2 expect me?
<XAX> Oh yes. I can't wait to start on it >_>
<Giger4444> I didnt like the necromancer. I found it useless in most boss fights.
<LucidDream> hehe
<Nabronyan> I find summoning classes useful because
<Ninjazz> Twilight's one is going to be very hard. man.
<Giger4444> then again Im a nobb, and not a hardcore gamer.
<Nabronyan> Even if the summons aren't strong enough to do damage to bosses
<XAX> Ninjazz: Why has everyone played diablo 2 except ME?
<Nabronyan> They can be used as meatshields
<Ninjazz> XAX: Because... I have no idea.
<F22skyhunter> sup guys
<Ninjazz> I should just play Diablo 2.
<Ninjazz> Hey F22skyhunter!
<Nabronyan> Which is what I had to do alot because my summons were just so underpowered
<Nabronyan> Because I was a terrible necromancer
<Mutterguy> XAX, I HAVEN'T
<Giger4444> Yeah, but if I remeber correctly it lacks hard hitter units, which are needed in boss fights
<Jim> ohai everypony
<Ninjazz> Hey Jim!
<XAX> Me and Mutterguy
<F22skyhunter> sup Jim
<Giger4444> fighting Duriel was a nightmare with a necromancer
<Jim> Just listening to that yatta song
<Jim> Why? Because I can
<XAX> Maybe we could meet and discover diablo 2 together Mutterguy >_> lol
<Nabronyan> I'll play too
<Nabronyan> Because
<Nabronyan> I never got far into the game
<Ninjazz> Obligitory XAX x Mutterguy comment here.
<Nabronyan> I HAVE AN IDEA
<Nabronyan> I say
<XAX> :o
<Nabronyan> We should all pool our moneys togethor, buy a mansion
<Nabronyan> And make it like
<Nabronyan> A brony hotel
<Nabronyan> Or something
<Nabronyan> Except
<Nabronyan> Free.
<Mutterguy> XAX, we could arrange this. It might be possible to meet outside the Southcity Christchurch libary
<Giger4444> Pretty much what uberhaxor nova and "the creatures" did.
<Nabronyan> I DID IT AGAIN Dx
*XAX doesent have a laptop.
<Ninjazz> Some what.
<XAX> *sigh*
<Nabronyan> I think I type too fast
<Mutterguy> mores spaces, less enter and you'll be fine
<Nabronyan> Advice taken.
<Nabronyan> Has anyone played Cry of Fear?
<LucidDream> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<XAX> But yeah Mutterguy, guess I'll try get on here next time im in chch :3
<LucidDream> :/
<Mutterguy> XAX, secondary solution... my household has a netbook
<Giger4444> How would we maintain a free hotel?
<XAX> :o
<Nabronyan> Ok, scratch the hotel part
<Nabronyan> More or less a giant household
<Nabronyan> For bronies.
<Ninjazz> Why would we need that?
<Giger4444> practically you are talking about building a big house from the collective money and everyone who live there would pitch in to pay the bills
<Giger4444> thats a start, but what would be the purpose?
<Nabronyan> It'd be the only safe spot from the zombie justin beiber fans
<Mutterguy> what Giger4444 said.. so long has people contribute to the various rates bills and maintence it could be very cheap
<Mutterguy> Also when the international congress for the foundation of Equstria needs to be held
<Nabronyan> NO
<Mutterguy> *Equestria
<Nabronyan> The mansion
<Nabronyan> Could be the capital of a nation of bronies.
*Nabronyan has a massive and unstable imagination.
<Mutterguy> I assuming the nation had yet to be founded
<Mutterguy> *i'm
<Giger4444> How much money did the brony documentary raised so far? about 70k bucks?
<Nabronyan> Uh
<Nabronyan> Not sure
<Nabronyan> If not, it was close to that, right?
<Giger4444> with that money you could buy a 1000-1200 squaremeter land where I live, but you'd need about additional 10 times this sum to build a mansion there :D
<Starflash> Dat post oO
<Giger4444> unless we get a sugar daddy, projects this size will remain a dream
<Mutterguy> I have to find the April's fool reddit thread...
<Ninjazz> It would be nice to have a hangout for bronies. Not sure if I would want to live with them though.
<BroniesFTW> Remember, American Idol's final performance will be at 8:00 pm EST today.
<Nabronyan> Ok, how about this
<Nabronyan> WE TAKE THE BRONIES
<Nabronyan> AND PUSH THEM INTO EQUESTRIA
<Ninjazz> If it were that easy. >>
<Kammerjunk> We should all purchase an island in the middle of nowhere (Which is possible) and then just live there in peace and harmony.
<Giger4444> I thought about it and I wouldnt want to live in Equestria
<Nabronyan> I wouldn't either
<Ninjazz> I live on one, Kammerjunk.
<Nabronyan> Hay, grass, and flowers don't exactly make a great meal for humans.
<Ninjazz> Finally. Someone who says that, Giger4444.
<Kammerjunk> At first, the thought of no meat pushed me off the thought of living in Equestria, because I love me some beef.
<Giger4444> That, and I just wouldnt belong there.
<Kammerjunk> But seriously, though, salad is awesome.
<Kammerjunk> Don't think I'd be able to live without cola, though.
<Ninjazz> Eh. I just can't properly imagine myself in Equestria.
<BroniesFTW> It's a tuesday morning at 7:30/6:30c now.
<Ninjazz> I still RP myself as a retired ninja LIVING among ponies.
<Ninjazz> But you know.
<Kammerjunk> So what was the original B film we were going to watch?
<Ninjazz> Samurai Cop.
<Nabronyan> I RP that im a pony living among retired ninjas.
<Kammerjunk> ^ wat
<Mutterguy> here we go http://www.reddit.com/r/t:2022/comments/rnhy2/bronys_buy_africa_and_rename_it_equestria/
<Ninjazz> You can buy continents?
<Kammerjunk> Mutterguy: But there's a place in Africa named "Equestria" ._.
<Giger4444> its an april fools post
<Kammerjunk> Well, of course it is. You can't buy a continent.
<Wrek> 05ON THE FUCKIGN SECOND!
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Wrek.
<Mutterguy> Still one ccan dream....
<Kammerjunk> Oh, is it Wrek playing?
<Ninjazz> Eyup.
<Giger4444> you can buy real estate, but I think in most countries it is limited how much land one person can own.
<Nabronyan> So
<Nabronyan> Anyone gonna play Fighting is Magic when it comes out?
<Kammerjunk> Giger4444: Which is why we all need to buy land and then just mash it together.
<Nabronyan> Im gonna buy a desert and name it "Lotsavsandinisia"
<Kammerjunk> wat
<Giger4444> Kammerjunk:I think the law applies to firms/consortiums etc. Im sure the governments wouldnt like it.
<Kammerjunk> Why do I keep hearing pings? I don't even have anything open which could ping me asides from mIRC.
<Jim> I'm gonna buy a forrest and call it "WherethefuckamI"
<Giger4444> Kammerjunk: like this?
<Mutterguy> OR We find an Asteroid (named Tom) and very carefully bringit down to earth...bit by bit or hollow it and live inside it...
<Phase4> Starflash, what post?
<Kammerjunk> It's not as scary as it used to be because my ping sound is Fluttershy saying "yay".
<Nabronyan> OR
<ofna01> good mornin
<Starflash> Hey ocean concert.
<Kammerjunk> Giger4444: Yeah, like that except it happens all the time.
<Nabronyan> We terraform mars
<ofna01> :)
<Jim> ohai ofna01
<Mutterguy> Kammerjunk so is mine....

<Mutterguy> RoboGerbil. Wrek is currently
<Phase4> well, attempted to read, its longer tha foe
<ofna01> reason i have to redo it is because i was nervous and shaking too much for them to get any clear pictures
<Giger4444> I fell asleep in an mri machine.
<Ninjazz> Hey RoboGerbil! Don't have the game, sorry.
<Giger4444> ofna01: may I ask why you needed a scan?
<Phase4> i gave up after the second time the guy went back in time to fix things

<Kammerjunk> I haven't bought Diablo III yet.
<Ninjazz> Hmmm
<Kammerjunk> Don't know if and when I will.
<Giger4444> I thought they would check hormones with blood tests.
<RoboGerbil> o nvm hes on nightmare already lol

<Kammerjunk> I have to do that anyway, since I end up breaking them one way or another.
<ofna01> my arms are all bruised from having to get shots and IV's so often
<ofna01> :'(
<Kammerjunk> That sounds bad, man. Hope it didn't affect how you think of doctors.
<ofna01> it doesnt
<Ghosties> 04I got stuck nine times in 48 hours one time I went to the hospital. Fun times
<Phase4> shows how reliable my memory is
<Giger4444> I really hope that you get support from friends and dont get bullied.
<ofna01> i got stuck 15 times before they found a vein
<ofna01> ;_;
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, I would have left
<Giger4444> inexperienced nurse?
<Ghosties> 04There's no way I would have waited through 15 attempts just to find a vein
<ofna01> i have small veins
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> daww poor ofna01
<Ghosties> 04I think my limit is three times
<ofna01> combined with the fact i hadnt had any water for awhile,made it alot worse
<Ghosties> 04If they don't find their mark by the fourth time then I'm done
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> i feel so tempted to give him wubs
<ofna01> go ahead
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> but it might anger the Ghosties
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<Ghosties> 04It will anger me
<ofna01> :|
<Ghosties> 04I, the great Ghost one

<Nerom> BLT Where?!!1
<Airpuff> Twi_Fi: Yeah.. she does have that pose..
<Ninjazz> Oh that has to be Applejack. That pose is too obvious of her.
<Ninjazz> common is a better word.
<GilDash> DitzyHooves: That's horrifying. :D
<DitzyHooves> I gonna say its Chrysalis
<Twi_Fi> And then suddenly.
<DitzyHooves> or Cadance
<Ninjazz> Horn.
<GilDash> I'm pretty sure AJ doesn't have a horn. :D
<Ninjazz> HOPE. HAS. RAISED.
<Airpuff> ... Well thats true GilDash xD
<Twi_Fi> I'm cool with a unicorn version of Applejack.
<GilDash> Twilight or Rarity mayhaps?
<Nerom> Prob Twilight
<Ninjazz> Eye design also hints Rarity.

<Litwick> It's Rarity from the eyes.
<Twi_Fi> Fingers?
<DitzyHooves> http://nerf-this.com/wallpaperly-sorry/ with Pinkie Pie scarf
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I thought Twilight because Wrek likes her, Rarity because of the eyes.
<Nerom> Airpuff: restart it

<Airpuff> Might it be the mayor? o.o
<DitzyHooves> what's the mayor's name?

<GilDash> Yeah, definitely Rarity.
<Nerom> Rarity's designer glasses

<Airpuff> GilDash: Yeah yeah.. never said it wasnt rarity, but it looked like the mayor at a certain point xD
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Bet you're happy now. ;)

<Ninjazz> GilDash: More than you can imagine...
<Airpuff> ô.o

<Airpuff> Ninjazz: ... Tuba?
<GilDash> Ninjazz: :D
<Ninjazz> You know... I don't know why I am talking to you ponies when I should be gawking at Wrek's Rarity.
<GilDash> Airpuff: Come on, it's a trombone. It sounds bad enough on its own. :D
<Twi_Fi> Dat picture is coming out nicely.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: She's not going anywhere. :D
<Airpuff> GilDash: ... I used to play the trombone when i was younger xD
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I wish she'd come here...
<Twi_Fi> Airpuff: Dat innuendo.
<GilDash> Airpuff: How big was your trombone? ;)
<Ninjazz> Damn you Rarity you bring out the worst im me...
<Ninjazz> So a bad side..
<Nerom> Just one thing how is she able to stand only on her two left legs?
<Airpuff> GilDash: .. Basstrombone xD
<GilDash> Airpuff: Do you want to get it out for me? ;)
<Litwick> Bow chicka wow ow

<GilDash> I've been here... 10 minutes. :D
<Kattchips-Pony> Hey everypony!
<OtakuTom> Can someone try pinging me? I'm trying to see if I got pings set up on HyrdaIRC set up correctly.
<GilDash> OtakuTom: Holla! :)
<Twi_Fi> Hey Kattchips-Pony.
<Nerom> Well atleast somepony listned to me :)
<OtakuTom> Darn...didn't work.
<Airpuff> Hai Kattchips-Pony
<GilDash> Kattchips-Pony: Holla! :)
<Resonantwaves> o.o
<Ninjazz> Hello Kattchips-Pony.
<Twi_Fi> Hello Resonantwaves.
<Airpuff> Nerom: I'd say she stands at three
<Nerom> Now yes
<GilDash> Rarity looks like she's tripping on something. :D
<Resonantwaves> Hello :D
<Kattchips-Pony> Thanks
<Ninjazz> She's trying to fabulous, GilDash.
<Ninjazz> No not trying...
<Ninjazz> She IS fabulous.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: It looks alike a shot just before she fails. :D
<Airpuff> Aaaw you made wrek change it ._.
<Airpuff> It wasnt that bad =I
<Airpuff> It wasnt bad at all acctually *glares*
<Nerom> Twise I did :P
<OtakuTom> Try again?
<GilDash> Airpuff: It was. If I can see it it's bad. :D
<Ninjazz> GilDash: With a smile like that? I think not!
<Ninjazz> OtakuTom! Yo!
<Airpuff> GilDash: Meh, it wasnt ._.
<OtakuTom> Gah! Why is it not working? :(
*Twi_Fi is watching Twilight read a book in the corner of the stream.
<OtakuTom> Maybe I should wildcard it...
<Derpy_Ctrax> Nick: Hello everybody! ( Hello brownies ;) )
<GilDash> Airpuff: Her center of mass was way off. It'd only work if she was propped up against something.
*Ninjazz has a bad feeling
<Airpuff> GilDash: How come?
<Ninjazz> Hello Derpy_Ctrax.
<Wrek> 05she is in motion so she doesnt trip
<GilDash> Airpuff: Just look at her!
<Ninjazz> HAH!
<GilDash> Wrek: That's the other available option. :D
<Twi_Fi> Hello Derpy_Ctrax.
<OtakuTom> One more time?
<Airpuff> GilDash: There is no telling wether or not she is leaning backwards...
<Ninjazz> OtakuTom! heeeeeeey!
<OtakuTom> Boourns...still not working...
<GilDash> I which case it looks strange with her right fore-hoof that far upwards. :D
<Wrek> 05besides if AJ can stand on only 2 left legs
<Nerom> Then how the buck does she have her right hoof before her left leg? Doing a sexy stance mid walk?
<Wrek> 05so can rarity
<Wrek> 05eeyup Nerom
<Ninjazz> ^
<GilDash> Airpuff: She's blatently not leaning backwards. :S
<Nerom> Logic is not flawed from wrek darn.. I rest my case
<Twi_Fi> When you look good physics can go buck itself.
<GilDash> Nerom: Those never go well. Not mid-walk. Termination, meybe. :D
<Airpuff> Wrek: No telling she's not leaning on her back leg though or putting any weight on it? ._.
<Airpuff> Wrek: Or are you going to make the ground like that it looks like she is leaning on it?
<Nerom> Well GilDash Wrek did confirm it
<GilDash> Seriouly, it looks like she's either propped up against something or she's about to falter on her next stride. But that's just my two cents.
<Ninjazz> How the hell am I going to study with her on screen, now?...
<GilDash> Nerom: Disregard artist, critique anyway. :D
<Ninjazz> DAT
<Ninjazz> WIGGLE
<Airpuff> Wrek: just draw a wall in the backroun and there is no problem ..
<Airpuff> backround*
<Nerom> Well Im an artist myself but not on wreks level but I do know my stuff
*Twi_Fi flips table.
<Wrek> 05implying im on a level
<GilDash> I'm an artist in no way shape or form. I'm just saying what my eyes see.
<Nerom> Level of awesomeness compared to me.. Atleast with ponies
<Airpuff> Im a noobie artist..
<GilDash> I've usually got a intuitive grasp of physics mecanics. So, I can't give you formulas. :D
<Airpuff> Feel bad when i compare against wreks work xD
<Twi_Fi> I wish I could draw....
<GilDash> Please, I haven't even draw anything and tried to be serious since primary school. :D
<Airpuff> Twi_Fi: You can.. just sketch up and use your time.
<Airpuff> Brb btw
<GilDash> BRB, removing plate...
<Radu> Rarity?
<Ninjazz> Last thing I drew were sketches of characters from Naruto. Ohhhh, those were dark days.
<Ninjazz> Yes, Radu.
<Ninjazz> The one and only. ;0
<Radu> Sweet.
<Ninjazz> ;)
<Twi_Fi> Hello Radu.
<GilDash> Wrek: Any chance of more GoT today?
<Radu> Hi there, Twi_Fi c:
<Ninjazz> He streamed GoT while I was gone?
<GilDash> Ninjazz: He did the first two eps of season 2 yesterday.
<Ninjazz> Damn it...
<Ninjazz> Always miss the good stuff. :(
<OtakuTom> Try one more ping on me?
<GilDash> Ninjazz: You should've gone to bed earlier then. :p
<GilDash> OtakuTom: PING!
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Not that. School.
<OtakuTom> Still not working :(
<Ninjazz> Just one more week and I am a Freeman.
<Twi_Fi> OtakuTom!
<Ninjazz> Or Freepony.
<Ninjazz> Either works.
<OtakuTom> I don't know why pinging isn't working on Hydra DX
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Well, tell your school to change its scheduel. :D
<GilDash> Ninjazz: That's funny, after this week I start work. :D
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Next thing in the morning they'll be hearing from me.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: The irony! :D
<GilDash> Ninjazz: It wouldn't be so bad, and it's for a nice place, but my brothers are both off for 2 weeks right when I start. =_=
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I'll be getting stick for a fortnight. :D
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Hmmm. Sounds bad.
<Ninjazz> Not so bad as you said.
<Ninjazz> But still, sounds like you'd rather do something else.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Oh no, it's fine. I'll just have to find something else to tease them about.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I'd rather do nothing. :D That's hardly an option though.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: What did you tease them about before?
<Ninjazz> My lord... She has a bracelet.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Mainly being able to laze around all day while they're at school/college like they're going to do to me now that I'm at work. :D
<Malavolent> Ello there, everypony.
<GilDash> Malavolent: Holla! :)
<Twi_Fi> Hello Malavolent.
<Ninjazz> Hey Malavolent!
<Airpuff> Hai Malavolent
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I thought she was going to be wearing a sweater for a moment...
<Airpuff> GilDash: that would be a waste o.o
<Ninjazz> GilDash: She'd look good in anything any way.
<GilDash> Airpuff: I dunno. I can think of at least one pony who might be interested in that. :D
<GilDash> Ninjazz: True, true.
<Airpuff> Really GilDash ? =O
<Ninjazz> Who would that pony be I wonder?
<GilDash> Airpuff: Ah ha. ;)
<OtakuTom> Meh...I'll work on it later...I'm missing out on watching the drawing :P
<Airpuff> brb..... AGAIN D=
<GilDash> Ninjazz: It's probably not appropriate for here. And it's not me either. :D
<Ninjazz> GilDash: *Raises eyebrow* What?
<OtakuTom> And I'm apparently missing out on some interesting chat XD
<Wrek> 05she twirls around, stops mid motion in front of the mirror, raising her hoof to watch her bracelet as she slowly falls forward with gravity adn then catches herself and continues twirling around
<GilDash> Ninjazz: ... Braeburned. :D
<Ninjazz> OtakuTom: Rarity being drawn. Get in here.
<Kammerjunk> I am digging this song.
<GilDash> Wrek: So much justification... :D
<Ninjazz> I like it...
<Ninjazz> So much.
<GilDash> Confound logic and stopping in the moment. :D
<Ninjazz> And I do not approve of that ship, GilDash. :|
<ofna01> I AM A DWARF AND IM DIGGING A HOLE,DIGGY DIGGY HOLE,IM DIGGING A HOLE
<Ninjazz> Barely know each other.
<Kammerjunk> Stupid, sexy Braeburn.
<Twi_Fi> Wait, what shipping?
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Well, he's for the other gender anyway. ;)
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Indeed he is. :D
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: Not Braeburn, Braeburn*ed.*
<GilDash> Ninjazz: He does like sweaters though. :D
<Kammerjunk> GilDash: I stand by my statement.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Taking them off, more like.
*Twi_Fi cares not for Braeburn.
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: Yeah, Braeburn is... confusing me. :D
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I don't think he bothers. :D
<Kammerjunk> GilDash: Everypony is gay for Braeburn. 'Tis a fact.
<Ninjazz> So much Rarity...
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: I guess so... Explain Thunderlane then. :D Or 'Soarin. :D
<Om> Good morning.
<Kammerjunk> Soarin's pretty cool, but he's no Braeburn.
<Ninjazz> Hey Om! Damage report.
<GilDash> Om: You've missed Airpuff's trumpet ceremony.
<Om> Lucky me.
<Om> Ninjazz: Damage?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Aw shit, best pony drawing
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: I'll be honest, for stallions it's Breaburn, Thunderlane, followed slightly behind by 'Soarin.
<Ninjazz> Om: I assume you are constantly being attacked while I am gone.
<Kammerjunk> Heus Om, et salve, CrimsonPhoenix.
<Twi_Fi> Hello Om.
<Ninjazz> CrimsonPhoenix: Indeed! Welcome! ;)
<Twi_Fi> Hello CrimsonPhoenix.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bonjour Bronystate~
<GilDash> CrimsonPhoenix: Holla! :)
<Om> Ninjazz: Probably.
<GilDash> Om: That'd be no fun. I need some kind of reaction. ;)
<Airpuff> Hopefully.. i get to sit here for more than 1 minute this time ._.
<Ninjazz> Om: Does that mean you don't want to talk about that? :S
<GilDash> Airpuff: Take your computer with you!
<Om> GilDash: I just woke up, you can wait.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: You might not want to hear about it. ;)
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Actually, I would.
*GilDash brushes Om's bedridden mane.
<Om> Ninjazz: I remember lots a lazers
<GilDash> Om: Brushie, brushie, brushie...
<Ninjazz> :D
<Airpuff> GilDash: ... While carrying a furniture and a grill around my house? xDD

<GilDash> Airpuff: ANOTHER I SAY! :D
<Ninjazz> Wrek: If L4D has tought us anything, take the entire bottle in one go.
<Wrek> 05but ive had several jugs already
<Airpuff> Meh GilDash .. you're never pleased..
<GilDash> Airpuff: You never put enough effort in. ;)
<Airpuff> Wrek: ... maybe Huuuuuuuuge!! Tracts of land will help ya?
<Om> Effort is for loosers.
*Airpuff stares at GilDash .... Ya right.
<Ninjazz> :S
<Om> Or losers?
<Ninjazz> Losers.
<GilDash> Airpuff: Experience would say otherwise. :)
<Om> Ninjazz: Thanks
<Airpuff> GilDash Ahahaha
<Ninjazz> My pleasure, Om. :)
<GilDash> Om: Your grammar is failing everywhere now. :D
<OtakuTom> Wow...I must be tired...I'm randomly clicking between the websites that I frequent, and suddenly went to Bronystate going "I wonder if anybody's streaming anything"...while already watching the stream >_>
<Om> GilDash: I don't need gramer in the morning
<GilDash> Cue my own grammar failure any message now... :D
<Radu> Hmm, the majority of bronies (about 32%) are atheists
*Ninjazz hands OtakuTom some coffee
<Airpuff> Epic OtakuTom xD
<Ninjazz> I'm not one of them Radu. Just saying.
*GilDash is extra careful with the grammar in his messages for a little while.
<Airpuff> Radu: Im simply a God. xD
<OtakuTom> Holy Crap! Pings work all of a sudden! I have no clue why, either!
<Radu> Same 'ere Ninjazz
<Radu> Oh you, Airpuff. :D
*Airpuff giggles
<GilDash> Airpuff: You've got the ego of one. ;)
<Airpuff> GilDash: Thats beacuse i am one Silly :P
<GilDash> Airpuff: Shame you haven't got the stamina. ;)
<Airpuff> GilDash: Looks who's talking xD
<GilDash> And... the chat room is silent. :D
<Om> I'll be back, gota take the morning bathroom run. AWAY!
*Ninjazz bonks GilDash and Airpuff with a rolled up newspaper
<Ninjazz> Down ponies.
<GilDash> Airpuff: Oh, but I am a simple pony, not a god. :D
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Hush, you. :p
<Airpuff> GilDash: Well i am a god. Idm. I have to put myself down at your level xD
<GilDash> Airpuff: I think you mean elevate to mine. :)
<OtakuTom> It's just about bedtime for me, actually. I just got home from work a little over an hour ago. At least I have the night off tonight so I can hang out here without being distracted by tons of phone calls.
<Ninjazz> I'm not the one filling this chat with innuendo, GilDash.

<Airpuff> GilDash: Cant come with a comeback now.. thats sad =c
<GilDash> Ninjazz: It's a perfectly clean conversation unless you're already in a dirty state of mind. Maybe you should work on that. :)
<Ninjazz> I know right, Radu.
<Airpuff> Mhm Ninjazz You should take a cold shower.
<Twi_Fi> Goodnight OtakuTom.
<Airpuff> Gn OtakuTom
<GilDash> Airpuff: Tsk, I'm one over you. ;)
<Lighty> 06irs HOT outside X.x
<OtakuTom> Ah...maybe that's why pinging wasn't working earlier...punctuation at the end doesn't get flagged for the ping...
<GilDash> OtakuTom: Night. :)
<Ninjazz> GilDash: My mind is constantly in that state of mind. Unlike you, I know how to repress it.
<OtakuTom> I'll work on that later. See you all later.
<Airpuff> GilDash: Yeah.. you're over me... "If you know what i mean?"
<Ninjazz> Cya OtakuTom
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Unlike you I don't think it needs to be repressed. :)

<Om> Ninjazz: You don't?
<Airpuff> Maintenance?....

<Ninjazz> Om: I don't... :|
<TheRandomkid321> I hope glitterglue isnt toxic... Is glitter glue toxic? Well if so bye.
<Om> Ninjazz: Sure sure.

<GilDash> Om: Tsk, if you want a tease, try me. ;)
<Airpuff> ô.o
<Ninjazz> Om: It's one of my hallmarks. I actually think I might be one of the only to use it.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I use that word a lot too. Just not in chat. :D

<Om> Ninjazz: I don't think you would help before.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rarity is best poni
<Litwick> It's because Wrek doesn't like you anymore. He's no longer your waifu.
<Ninjazz> Om: I would, though.
<Ghosties> 04He was never my waifu
<Ghosties> 04But he was always one of my artists
<Ghosties> 04Does that count?
<Ninjazz> CrimsonPhoenix: Agreed.
<Airpuff> xD
<GilDash> Om, Ninjazz: You shouldn't talk about ponies right in front of them. :)
<Litwick> Yes. He's no longer your artist.
<Om> Ninjazz: Saying wou "would" doesn't mean you will.

<Radu> Who is he?
<GilDash> Om: Just making you feel wanted. ;)
*Airpuff stares at Om.. yes they are! Keeps on noming at Ninjazz 's ear.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: You need to be up a bit earlier to see what he streams.
<Ghosties> 04Any of you ever heard of Jet Set Radio? It was a Dreamcast title that came out in 2000, I believe
<Litwick> silent chat?
*Ninjazz twitches his ears
<Om> GilDash: This is not the way to do it.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: No, just on Bronystate earlier. :D
<Litwick> Nope, just my stupid chat scrolling up to the top on it's own.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Also works. :)
<Ghosties> 04Okay so
<Ghosties> 04This is Vinyl
<GilDash> Ghosties: I vaguely know what you're talking about. I assume its something from that ponified?
<Ghosties> 04http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/284/9/0/mlp___vinyl_scratch_by_joehellser-d4ckjdr.jpg
<Airpuff> Yeah.. that is Vinyl.. xD

<Ghosties> 04And this
<Ghosties> 04Is Beat
<Ghosties> 04http://images.wikia.com/jetsetradio/images/9/9c/BeatJSR.jpg
<Ninjazz> Vinyl should scratch somepony.
<HyperMetalLugia> that was
<HyperMetalLugia> freaking retarded

<HyperMetalLugia> wow
<Ghosties> 04Leader of the GGs, a graffiti painting inline skating crew
<Airpuff> See what you did there Ninjazz ... xD
<GilDash> Ghosties: That's a blast from the past, and I've never even seen a real Dreamcast. :D
<Om> Sounds epic
<Ninjazz> Oh so that's a ponied GG?
<Ninjazz> I mean Beat.
<Ghosties> 04Basically, when I saw Vinyl I thought "Dude, she's Beat but in pony form and R63'd"
<HyperMetalLugia> > remove the bluetooth configs/service and tell mint to backup, I close my laptop and when I opened it, it was at the login screen and cinnamon was gone and Unity was there, wtf
<Ninjazz> I can see the resemblence.
<Om> And you wanted wreck to draw that?
<Ghosties> 04But uh, if you've never played Jet Grind Radio you should do so
<Ghosties> 04It's one of the greatest games
<Soital> 12so I just watched an ongoing "honest trailers" series on youtube
<Soital> 12lmao
<Ghosties> 04Ever
*GilDash is retrieving squash. Be right back. ;)

<Soital> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Soital, you are a 4Nidoran (f).
<GilDash> Om: No, not the plant. :D
<pyrocatboy> Good morning everypony
<Airpuff> mornin pyrocatboy
<Ninjazz> Hey pyrocatboy!
<Ghosties> 04I wanted someone that I knew could bring my request to life, that would treat the drawing with talent and respect
<Om> Ghosties: Ohhh, that sounds like a good crossover
<Ghosties> 04And Wrek was pretty much the best choice
<Om> GilDash: Have you ever had the plant?
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<pyrocatboy> Whats Wrek drawing?
<Om> Ninjazz: Our chance for what?
<Ninjazz> Om: RUN YOU FOOL!
<Airpuff> Lol Ninjazz he dosent even remember xD
<Ghosties> 04He's drawing Vinyl Scratch and a ponified Beat from Jet Set Radio
<Wrek> 05(cause he doesnt know that many people he quite a loner and suc.. i mean HI I WUB WHU)
<Om> -_- where Ninjazz
<Ninjazz> Om: Incredibily good point, my friend.
<Airpuff> Om... There's no escape.
<Om> Airpuff: Go play with a traped mouse of somehting >.>
*pyrocatboy noms on Om
*Airpuff giggles at Om I am
<Ninjazz> Wow.
<Ghosties> 04But man, I seriously can't wait till later this Summer. Jet Grind Radio HD is coming out on XBLA and PSN
<Om> >_< doh
<Airpuff> Yay.
<Ghosties> 04My problem
<Ninjazz> I might get it then, Ghosties. I don't think I could find a Dreamcast.
<Om> pyrocatboy: Why must you encourage them.
<Ghosties> 04Is that I bought a used Dreamcast and a copy of Jet Grind Radio for it two days before learning of the HD release
<Ghosties> 04Soooooooooooooo, I felt kinda peeved
<Ninjazz> Awww, man.
<Ghosties> 04But hell, I got Shenmue as well
<Ghosties> 04And Shenmue is epiccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
<Ninjazz> Dat terrible luck.
<pyrocatboy> Om : Because I feel like it.
<Ninjazz> Oh! Then it's all worth it.
<Ghosties> 04Yep :3
<Ghosties> 04Besides, Dreamcast was like the coolest system ever
<Om> I dislike that reason -_-
<Ninjazz> Before it died, you know?
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, pretty much
<Ninjazz> I wonder how did it die. You had so much promise.
<Radu> So much red
<pyrocatboy> Om : Well too bad!
<Ghosties> 04I believe it could have contended with PS2 and Xbox, honestly
<Ninjazz> It*
<Ghosties> 04Bad marketing
<Ghosties> 04SEGA really messed it up
*Airpuff giggles at pyrocatboy "Good going"
<Wrek> 05welcoem to sweden, where the coffee is so strong it could kill a samll animal
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Bad advertising or marketing I'd assume.
<Ninjazz> Ahhhh.
<Airpuff> lol Wrek xD
<Ninjazz> Always the case.
<Ghosties> 04Lol, don't mess your internal organs up Wrek :P
<GilDash> Airpuff: Well, we're all big game here. :D
<Airpuff> GilDash: Eeyup
<pyrocatboy> Wrek : ...I WANT SOME!!!
<Ninjazz> Wrek how bad could that be?
<Ghosties> 04But Dreamcast had some truly amazing titles. Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, Shenmue, JGR, and those are just a few examples
<Wrek> 05bad?
<Ninjazz> Good* :)
<Wrek> 05no you misunderstand
<Wrek> 05its good
<Ninjazz> I should get some...
<Ninjazz> Ugh. I need a cup right now.
<GilDash> It's bad for you but too good for you to care. :)
<Ninjazz> Yeah, that logic.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Heh, logic. :D
<Om> GilDash: You missed an apostrophie.
<Ninjazz> Who needs it right, GilDash? :3
<GilDash> Om: Where? :S
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Exactly. :D
<Om> GilDash: Right there, I'm pointing at ti.
<Ninjazz> it*
<Om> Ninjazz: Meh
<GilDash> Om: Nope, don't see it. :)
<Litwick> The same cannot be said for the Saturn though.
<Litwick> The system, not the mod.
<Om> GilDash: That is because the lazers took it out.
<Ghosties> 04Hmm, these pringles are pretty good.
<GilDash> Litwick: Oh, the Sega Saturn. I was going to say. :D
<Ghosties> 04I almost bought a Sega Saturn once when I was a kid
<GilDash> Om: Lasers can't mess with my grammar. :)
<Ghosties> 04What could have been...what could have been...
*Airpuff stares at om... "Dat lazer..." xD
*GilDash smacks Airpuff.
<GilDash> Airpuff: Don't you start. :|
<Om> GilDash: I never said anything about lasers, I am talking about LAZZZZERS!
*pyrocatboy is cut by LAZAR
<Om> Airpuff: Start.
<Airpuff> You know you'd hit Ninjazz instead of me? xD
<GilDash> Om: Lasers? Oh yes, I know what they are. :)
<Ghosties> 04I never did get to play NiGHTS

<derpy_pony> now that the explosions are covered, where are the clowns?
*Om impersonates Nicholas Cage
<Ghosties> 04PISS BLOOD!

*pyrocatboy salutes
<Om> Ninjazz: He said that?
<GilDash> Om: For someone impersonating Nick you're doing an appaling job.
<SirGanjalf> Ghosties: Search in YT for "Nick Cage loses his shit", if you didn't already;)
<Ninjazz> Om: Oh yes. It's worse than you think too.
<GilDash> Airpuff: It will be for you. ;)

<pony_5853> lets do this
<Ninjazz> One of his better performances, if you ask me.
<Meanwhile> Dis soundtrack
<Ghosties> 04Hell, probably the least crazy Cage films are either the National Treasure films or Face Off
<derpy_pony> this music would fit to something medieval, but not to this
<Wrek> 05i liked faceoff
<SirGanjalf> Ninjazz: Few of the moments when his role is not over the top
<Ghosties> 04Face Off was okay
<Ninjazz> I liked National Treasure.
*Om resists urge to sing "Cant touch this" knowing the penalty for doing so.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: That's why I can tolerate him in this.
<Nerom> I don't think i have seen Face off
*GilDash touches Om.
*Airpuff looks at Om... Do it..
<pony_5853> cand touch this
<GilDash> Om: I'm on top of you, silly filly. :D
<Ninjazz> GilDash: You should learn to love his Over acting. :3
<Om> GilDash: Guess you're easy to forget.
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<Om> Airpuff: No.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: That's the problem. It sort of ruins the film for me. :S
<pony_5853> :[:[

<Om> GilDash: And here you are, seducing internet ponies.
<ACS13123> GilDash: Kinda like me, but i literally ONLY tell people i can trust...
<Malavolent> GilDash: Well, I don't really have need to tell my family that I watch cartoon equines made for little kids. It's still shame there are not many bronies in my country.
<GilDash> Om: Anonyimity. :)
<ACS13123> which is hardly anyone
<alexxm> where are you from Malavolent
<GilDash> ACS13123: My problem is I *don't* trust anyone. :D

<ACS13123> Gildash: Thats why only about 1 or 2 know :P
<alexxm> hey RainbowAsh what have you been up to
<WallDives> my friends know, but I dont flaunt it or make it obvious.
<GilDash> Malavolent: That is my lament. I wish I could hook up with people IRL.
<alexxm> how is it there Malavolent
<panda> GilDash: you do?
<GilDash> panda: Yeah. :)
<RainbowAsh> alexxm, just watching my pc crash from hd freeze and waiting for it to reboot
<Malavolent> alexxm: Not that bad, but I still envy bronies in the US to have so many meetups and.. Tara...
<panda> GilDash: that would be really cool ^^ but I wouldnt "hook up" unless im hearing you wrong ;)
<GilDash> panda: I mean meet face to face. Not what you're thinking. :D
<Saturn> 08,01http://pastebin.com/LtEYAXW2 <--- i just made this facebook event
<panda> Malavolent: well... the nearest brony around here is 70 miles away...
<panda> GilDash: mmmmhmm..... ;)
<Saturn> 08,01a long shot, but if any of you are in the vicinity of St Andrews, Scotland tomorrow, come and join me
<Malavolent> Saturn: Ohai Saturn, how did the date with that Molestia girl go?
<Om> I just don't like people. Internet people is about my limit.
<owlicious> Saturn: nepotism?
<Saturn> 08,01owlicious: yes.
<owlicious> how?
<Malavolent> panda: Feels bad, you probably should convert your friends :D
<Saturn> 08,01Malavolent: horribly
<Saturn> 08,01she didn't show up!
<panda> Saturn: may I join... via cam? XD
<Malavolent> Saturn: No way! Did you have flowers?
<panda> Malavolent: meh, tried... no dice :(
<Malavolent> Saturn: Chicks dig flowers.
<Saturn> 08,01panda: doubtless there will be a laptop there; we're all comp scis. so yeah, sure!
<Saturn> 08,01Malavolent: i had a wilted lily, if you know what i mean
<panda> Saturn: hehe, now I just have to find some hard liquor... but forgive me, im not a drinker :D
<Malavolent> panda: Well, all my closest friends are both deeply practical and see no reason to watch ponies.
<GilDash> Why am I so tired when I've been getting 7 hours sleep? :|
<panda> Malavolent: well... mine are just indifferent... they dont like it or dislike it... but I'm not gonna push it :D
<Om> Man wrek you do some nice eyes.
<Malavolent> Saturn: You should put it in wet place, obviously.
<Malavolent> panda: That's right, don't be obsessed about it :)
<Bronysith> Om: so seductive
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, time to revise and eat icecream
<Saturn> 08,01and i'm all out of icecream
<Saturn> 08,01:(
<Bronysith> Saturn: cheers?
<Cobellanez> I just sent my letter to Val for Luna, I felt like writing a limerick.
<Om> Bronysith: They are, but that isn't what makes them good.
<Om> Its not bad tho
<Bronysith> Om: i love Wrek eye designs
<panda> Malavolent: hm... obsession with ponies and sanity with ponies... there is a fine, blurred line between the two :D
*Chrysalis buys Saturn some icecream
<panda> :D Saturn
<Malavolent> Saturn: For the record, how much is a bucket of ice cream in Scotland?
<Om> Bronysith: I think we all do
<RainbowAsh> A storyline? In my "And that's how equestria was made?" I am intrigued. http://equestria.fadri.org/
<Malavolent> panda: Yep, pony overdose is never good, though,
<Om> Malavolent: Unsless you're a brony
<panda> Malavolent: for sure, which is why im enjoying this wait
<Wrek> 05FUCKIGN HEADACHE
<Malavolent> Om: I ment pony overdose is never good for your friends. You can never have enough pony for yourself. :D
<panda> Om, well... you dont want to flip the scales and become an anti brony... right?
<panda> Wrek: slept more than 8 hours again?
<Om> panda: I was a hater before I joined the heard.
<panda> Om: really?
<Saturn> 08,01there once was a pony called Luna, who drove in a Renault Laguna, she drank with her sister, who drunkenly kissed her, then sent her blue ass to the moon-ah
<Om> panda: Aye. Not a big one. You've seen my sharp toung as it were
<panda> Saturn: oh my... your randomness is a force to be reckoned with
<Chrysalis> Saturn you should be revising
<panda> Om: yeah, I can only immagine "non brony" Om XD
<GilDash> Saturn: I can actually see that happening. :D
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: i really should
<Chrysalis> go learn AI
<Wrek> 05any audioslave/soundgarden fans in here?
<Bronysith> Saturn: would u like some pie?
<Malavolent> Saturn: Poor Luna is the victim again.
<Om> panda: Much less love and tolerance.
<Bronysith> Wrek: soundgarden is nice
<WallDives> ...well, I think the "bad" thing found me.
<Saturn> 08,01there was a young woman from Venus / whose body was shaped like a-- yeah, i'll get my coat

<Om> WallDives: Ahh, not sure what to say to that...

<GilDash> Om: Sight to behold, eh? ;)
<Bronysith> Malavolent: unfortunately i am
<Lil_B> Health typ number Somthing: Don't eat to much Rhubarb or you will get Kidney Stones.
<WallDives> Malavolent: depends on brand and weight.

<Om> Malavolent: I havent a clue, havent had icecream in a while
<GilDash> Om: Honestly I just feel really tired today. I'm not sure why. :S
<Lil_B> I use metric :I
<Bronysith> Malavolent: america is going down the shitter. we are seen as fat selfish pigs
<Om> GilDash: To much mental exurtion? That can do it to some people.
<GilDash> Om: I haven't been doing anything particularly challenging though.
<Malavolent> Bronysith: Stereotypes. I'd personally love to live in the US.
<Om> GilDash: Dunno then, could be a minor cold. Or alergies?
<Bronysith> Malavolent: there are alot of assholes here
<GilDash> Om: I'm not sick. Just tired.
<Bronysith> drink some tea GilDash
<Om> I may be one of those assholes.
<Malavolent> Bronysith: There are a lot of a-holes everywhere.
<Bronysith> Malavolent: i know
<Lil_B> Bronysith my teacher said that everyone in the US is way more friendlyer then here (Germany)
<Om> GilDash: Hmm, I dunno then.
<Malavolent> Bronysith: There are also a lot of bronies ^^
<Malavolent> And Tara Strong.
<Bronysith> Malavolent: yea
<Malavolent> Man, how can you even complain?
<Bronysith> Malavolent: idk
*pyrocatboy starts singing along
<Om> Lil_B: Depends on the city and the state
<Bronysith> Malavolent: i guess cause it seems the world is blaming america for the problems
<Bronysith> or how there are many sheep
<Bronysith> ANYWHOO
<Bronysith> pie time
*Bronysith eats 1 ton of pie
<WallDives> Malavolent: around $2-$4 for that much, maybe?

<Malavolent> alexxm: Oh, nevermind :)
<BlazeAngel> No outside links owlicious .
<prince-dari> When when we are recruiting mods, usually advertise as such at some point either on our site, or on the IRC. Then we accept applications, for which we send you a format if you want to submit an application. All the mods then look at your application and decide on whether or not to offer you an interview.
<Malavolent> Dat white.
<prince-dari> After the interview we all again vote and decide whether or not the applicant should be a mod.
<owlicious> oh right, the stream.
<GilDash> Agg! Mod-wall!
*GilDash hides.
<BlazeAngel> K, I will run that by my accosiates too. Thanks! :3
<Om> GilDash: Something your afraid of? Interesting.
<WallDives> just me, I find interesting that you use the application process, instead of a nomination process.
<GilDash> Om: I prefer to avoid Imperial entanglements. :)
<Malavolent> WallDives: There are quite a lot of skilled poeple, who don't chat at all.
<BlazeAngel> GilDash: Imperials are the true leaders.
<WallDives> Malavolent: I'm aware, I just said it was interesting, not that it was good or bad.
<Saturn> 08,01we also put you through trials, like appeasing the dari-bot, jumping through things that are on fire, and listening to my poetry
<BlazeAngel> OU Saturn .
<Meanwhile> Sounds like I missed something interesting.
<GilDash> BlazeAngel: Rebels FTW. :)
<Malavolent> Saturn: I though the last is forbidden by law.
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<WallDives> hello Meanwhile.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Woa what's going on here?

<Meanwhile> Saturn's poetry is...yeah, Vogons.
<Om> Rebel against rebelion. Like a baws.
<GilDash> Saturn: I like Vogon poetry. It makes me laugh.
<Malavolent> WallDives: Well, aplications seems better to me.
<BlazeAngel> CrimsonPhoenix: Stuff.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I like stuff
<Malavolent> It's so stuffy.
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: pervert.
<owlicious> stuffing is best stuff
<WallDives> Malavolent: It's more fair.
<CrimsonPhoenix> like stuffing a turkey
<Malavolent> WallDives: That too.
<alexxm> hey Meanwhile hows your day been
<Meanwhile> So Saturn, why do you put people through your poetry and flaming things?

<Saturn> 08,01ScootaChicken: also, i'm not sure how that'd work with regards to accommodation
<panda> aww Saturn, you're so nice ^^
<ScootaChicken> My parents probably wouldn't be so keen on me going to a convention for more than one day.
<alexxm> WallDives you recken they'll bring back the european championship
<ScootaChicken> Even if I lied and told them it was a guitar convention or something.
<WallDives> alexxm: no. Not Happening.
<Radu> I can even imagine Saturn telling ScootaChicken the classic "COME TO BED"
<Meanwhile> Do you get guitar conventions?
<alexxm> how come WallDives
<Saturn> 08,01Radu: dude, he's 14
<WallDives> alexxm: Mcmahon doesnt like it, HHH doesnt like it, and there's too many belts.

<GarrettBrony> Wrek can I suggest some Boston. If thats okay with you.
<WallDives> alexxm: for trips, I think its because there's just too many belts. for mcmahon, who knows.
<WallDives> Meanwhile: means you're safe.

<Meanwhile> Not so. Saturn's seen me before.

*Nabronyan Glomps Princess_Molestia
<TheRainbowDash> ACS13123: and you'll fail.
<Giger4444> My handwriting is also sucks and it's hard to read but thats partly because Im left handed.

<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: I can only imagine... If he's turned down GilDash, im sure that you wouldn't have as much luck either. :D
<GilDash> Ninjazz: TheRainbowDash is too damned forwards. :D I'm more subtle. I like building up to things... ;)
*Airpuff crashes with TheRainbowDash fainting from the impact
<Meanwhile> Irish_Pony: It's too stuffy in here, can't think straight.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: I have some luck, at times. Only two ponies that turned me down is Om and you.:D
<Ninjazz> GilDash: YOU CALL THAT SUBTLE?! :D
<PONY> Ninjazz, one does not simply turn down GilDash
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: I do not build things up, go straightforward.
<Irish_Pony> Meanwhile: Do you need a "drink?"
<WallDives> lol, subtle.
<Ninjazz> PONY: Tell that to Om.
<Airpuff> GilDash: .... youre subtle?... xD
<ScootaChicken> Y'know, given the fair amount of people who have been claiming my performance was rushed, I'm willing to redo it without rushed-ness.
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Remember I'm still one of your firsts. ;)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Anyone with $50 to spare help me with something? I will pay you back.
<ScootaChicken> If enough people demand it.
<Jim> A drink as in a drink, or a drink as in a "drink"?
<PONY> Ninjazz, are you calling that simple after two weeks?
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Ah, yes. Must not forget that now.
<Dark_Horst> i say, jewelry is something this man can do
*Irish_Pony pulls GilDash into his barrel and closes the lid
<GilDash> Ninjazz: It's more subtle then TheRainbowDash's method. :D
<TheRainbowDash> Nittany_Discord: Ummm, I got nothing left at the momet being.:(
<WallDives> GilDash: more like less straightforawrd.
<TheRainbowDash> (moment)
<GilDash> Irish_Pony: Oh, so you can manhandle me now? ;)
<Airpuff> GilDash: .. i guess you got some point there..
<PONY> GilDash has been very subtle lately
<Ninjazz> PONY: No. Not too simple. Just don't underestimate Om's abilities.

<SirPeckerish> We should watch Empire of the Ants. Good film.
<Nabronyan> I SAY
<Nabronyan> WE SHOULD WATCH
<Nabronyan> THE AVENGERS
<Meanwhile> We should dig a moat
<TheRainbowDash> WallDives: Ywh, pretty much speaking the truth there.

<Jim> What's a moat?
<Bronysith> I SHALL FETCH A RUG!!
