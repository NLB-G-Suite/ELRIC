<MI9000> 43 wing beats per second
<RaveBrony> D:
<otakon> ValtheJean: It's not horrible, but taken at face value it makes little sense to the rest of the series and that which it stands for. It throws former concepts out of the window and more or less solves the main issue of the game through "space magic" plus you don't find out what happens to ANYONE of the many important secondary characters or even your closest friends.
<Activate_The_pootis> BUFFA THE VIDEO SLAYER!

<String_Shredder> baby: "where the fuck am i?"
<brony_158> Film Ree;!
<ZombieBrony> That is why I don't like RD
<Pale_Horse> Dash, get that diaper out of your mouth. :P
<Obsidian> Still needs n=moar buffering
<Hrafn> who even build roads that end at the edge of a cliff? :P
<derpy_pony> they're jealous
<JoseEnriquez> Dat monie cutie mark
<Kandarihu> Alright. I'm suggesting a documentary for both A movie and B movie
<Qelix> the episode is quite okay until RD becomes a selfish bitch. okok. selfish RD is funny, too.
<IshBestPony> otakon x g3 baby
<MadSurge> Indeed Qelix
<derpy_pony> everypony is a jerk in this episode
<Radu> Don't you call RD a bitch, you bitch
<Rukario> it really doesn't help that the person who reviewed my essay didn't seem to even like weird al
<Ninjazz> This episode is so controversial...
<brony_158> His special talent is smoking....
<RainbowAsh> This episode would be much better if the other mane 6 had actually tried to talk to RD at all.
<Obsidian> Not Mr Waddle!
<DeathStar> yay spiderman!
<Kipkat07_Mare> nooo save the old people!!!!
<Meanwhile> Ew.
<Kandarihu> Oh, shoot. I'm too late.
<Airpuff> I dont like this one at all =c Being a fn of rainbow dash....
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Rainbow Dash is still my favorite.
<Rukario> i sensed a really negative personality in between the lines
<drf|osx> HML, as much as I hate to say it, it's not the worst thing ever
<DerpStar> It's a Spiderman parody
<Ninjazz> RainbowAsh: Then no drame.
<brony_158> :P
<TheWalrusCancer> Suddenly, string of Ponyville disasters.
<MadSurge> DERPY
<String_Shredder> yay spiderman knock offs!
<MahBoi777> oh my
<Ninjazz> Drama*
<drf|osx> that being said, all I'm doing is IRC
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol seeing that photographer pony makes me want a Frank West pony "He's covered wars ya know." :D
<Wrek|Observiking> 05aad she's so happy
<drf|osx> for anything actually useful it's kinda not possible
<RainbowAsh> Ninjazz, I could totally see RD blowing them off.
<drf|osx> XD
<Wrek|Observiking> 05aaw*
<Ingwaz> RD is too stuck on herself to be my favorite
<Rukario> drf you have experience with windows server 2008 right?
<Airpuff> I say the same Nittany_Discord: But still.. i dont like this ep x)
<Storm_Charger> slick moves
<GameTaco> ...I never thought of it that way. It's like, the only role the Mane 5 seem to have is foreshadowing for what they do for the rest of the episode.
<derpy_pony> the author of this episode got death threats for this
<drf|osx> yes
<Ninjazz> RainbowAsh: See.
<Kandarihu> Spiderman? This is a reference to Batman: The Animated Series.
<Ryanier128> same here Airpuff. I'm not a huge fan of this
<Rukario> anything with DC?
<MadSurge> ...silly.
<Ingwaz> pinkie is my favorite, because shes silly
<RainbowAsh> Ninjazz, it doesn't need to change anything but make the ponies likeable
<Radu> Sooo, whoever voted this the worst ep of Season 2?
<drf|osx> and the fact that Firefox can't even remember a simple preference is retarded
<drf|osx> DC?
<Storm_Charger> Deal with ti!
<Rukario> domain controller
<JoseEnriquez> inb4 kiss
<MadSurge> DEAL WITH IT
<Rukario> active directory
<Airpuff> I love the one with Daring do though..
<RainbowAsh> Radu, me. Not worst episode ever, though
<Radu> Deal with ti
<pony_300> <Twilight> Applejack, what is Rainbow Dash's ego level? <Applejack> It's over EIGHT THOUSAAAAAANNNNNND!!!
<GameTaco> Can we just call her Danger for short?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This episode was my least favorite of S2.
<drf|osx> I've used Active Directory
<drf|osx> but not DC
<brony_158> *pitchfork* Navk shippers! BACK!
<Radu> ^
<Roflbot> KISS
<Ninjazz> RainbowAsh: Hmmm.
<MadSurge> LET ME GO DASH
<Storm_Charger> Kiss?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just because there was nothing special with it.
<Airpuff> Immortalized xd
<derpy_pony> kiss
<TheRainbowDash> No, not the kiss!:O
<CrimsonPhoenix> that rumored kiss
<IshBestPony> I Liek Attention
<GameTaco> "Don't use such big words around me, Dashie."
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just meh.
<Rukario> i can't seem to get my windows 7 machine to log into my server 2008 server
<Rukario> so yeah x-x
<TheRainbowDash> (sighs):|
<twilight_sprinkle> its an important lesson for kids tho
<IshBestPony> Rainbow Dash is attention whore
<Nitram> Cya, night everypony

<drf|osx> do both of them have usernames with a password?
<Litwick> Her Ghost Rider

<DerpStar> Spike`s a Ghost!
<TheWalrusCancer> Spike's a ghost!
<MahBoi777> jinkies
<Kipkat07_Mare> Rainbow Dash is the only pony who has a bigger ego than me
<Ingwaz> nittany_discord i think secret of my excess is probably my least favorite. it just makes me cringe a bit
<Radu> Don't you dare call RD a whore.
<CupcakeWarrior> This is my least favorite episode, yet this was the new episode the first Saturday after I became a brony
<Storm_Charger> Those wigs need to be real
<Qelix> yeah. totally not bitching around.
<Airpuff> kk bye Nitram: =P

<DerpStar> A little wierd DavidCortez
<TheWalrusCancer> Radu: lesome individual in some other episodes.

<Storm_Charger> Jumping = Pinkie Pie
<CrimsonPhoenix> Pinkie Pie
<Kandarihu> I wish we'd have 10 seconds of buffering right after RD boasting about having 10 seconds to spare.
<pony_300> I love how the ponies forget about Rainbow Dash almost instantly
<mitamaking> That was the MMDW
<Magic> my pc is so slow i have to watch mlp on my phone
<CrimsonPhoenix> Jumping roof to roof
<ZombieBrony> They just forget about Rainbow?
<TheWalrusCancer> RD becomes supervillain.
<twilight_sprinkle> mayor-do-well
<Storm_Charger> Pinkie Pie is best free runer
<Qelix> well. it wasn't RD
<Ninjazz> RD over reacts.
<otakon> dat jealousy
<Roflbot> metal gear solid music?
<mitamaking> We never find out
<pony_300> I love this music
<IshBestPony> hey, Sparkle Sparkle
<GameTaco> Rainbow Dash would make an excellent supervillain. But the rainnuke would make her OP...
<Kandarihu> Hey, music reminds me of Metal Gear Solid
<ZombieBrony> Music reminds me of metal gear solid
<Qelix> music is great
<drf|osx> That was odd
<Yellowquiet> mg music ^^
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJ
<CupcakeWarrior> FUCK YEAH SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE
<pony_300> that's what I was thinking! Metal Gear
<Qelix> MDWAJ
<Roflbot> NEVER FEAR. ALCATRAZ IS HERE... if only ppl understood the reference
<Dark_Horst> dat spiderman rescue
<Kandarihu> Wow, ZombieBrony /)
<otakon> That's what I call
<GameTaco> Well. partly. I mean, she could rob a bank in ten seconds flat, but if she uses too much power, there won't *be* a bank. Or any bits.
<drf|osx> my home connection seems to randomly die for a few seconds
<otakon> putting the horse before the cart
<JESmith71> The hell you doing Dash? Quit giving the speech and stop the damn wagon
<IshBestPony> YEAH SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE
<Yellowquiet> why do they have that road anyway =
<DerpStar> I`m old enough to get it Roflbot
<JoseEnriquez> ^
<Storm_Charger> Super Strenght = Applejack
<GameTaco> And then the gears start turning...
<Radu> Skateboards.
<RainbowAsh> GameTaco, well, she could blow some stuff up and demand that Celestia pays her to stop
<ZombieBrony> Kandarihu (\
<mitamaking> spoils
<GameTaco> RANSOM!
<Pinkies4thWall> mysterious mare does well. Call her Mysterious Mare-Do-Well? seems legit
<Rukario> wb drf
<Rukario> after i'm done defragging
<twilight_sprinkle> lol Yellowquiet good point
<Rukario> i'll open up the Vms
<Rukario> VMs
<otakon> Storm_Charger: not really superstrength, but AJ does have very well developed legs from years of applebucking
<GameTaco> Hm. But then, that would be challenging Celestia, which is pretty daring.
<CrimsonPhoenix> PP
<Yellowquiet> ;)
<IshBestPony> see somepony actually gets it
<drf|osx> LOL defrag
<drf|osx> and wait
<RainbowAsh> When I first saw this episode I thought it would be awesome if MMDW was Luna
<CupcakeWarrior> Rainbow Dash, youre not spiderman
<DeathStar>
<Qelix> pinkie!!!
<drf|osx> VM?
<drf|osx> That might be why
<GameTaco> Toing. Toing. Toing.

<drf|osx> try putting Windows Server on an actual computer LOL
<Radu> Nah, Luna is taller
<Rukario> from memory what i was coming across as a problem was the windows 7 machine was no logon servers to proess the request
<Roflbot> man the pony community sucked that day
<CupcakeWarrior> lol
<DerpStar> Pinkie Sense FTW
<GameTaco> "Must. Resist. Urge. To. PARTY."

<MadSurge> Faint
<pony_300> Pinkie's Pinkie sense is an interesting superpower... wait..... PINKIE PIE IS SPIDERMAN!
<Evo_Kaer> debris sure falls far in equestria
<JESmith71> You do know RD, you'd be more helpful if you'd just go ahead and save them instead of announcing yourself every time
<Rukario> the ip settings are correct and the windows 7 machine is using the windows 8 machine as a dns server
<ZombieBrony> !
<Kipkat07_Mare> DO NOT WANT
<GameTaco> Except for the one that you *did* save.
<CupcakeWarrior> dat face
<Pinkies4thWall> DAT FACE
<DerpStar> dat grow;
<MahBoi777> that face
<MadSurge> Indeed
<mitamaking> I love the fact that the person she saved ignores her
<Qelix> deep female voice colt is right
<pony_7543> dat bgm
<RainbowAsh> Radu, well, if the alicorn states are like the super sayain levels, it could still work out

<Sundaysmile> tail in a bun
<Pinkies4thWall> HER ASS IS IRON

<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: CONSIDERING the huge amount of episodes where she is showered with love...
<CupcakeWarrior> Rainbow Dash x Granny Smith
<Qelix> the cronicles oh lamebow dash begin. your too awesome for this. stop it.
<pony_300> Granny is not amused

<MahBoi777> O_o
<String_Shredder> dat grunting
<twilight_sprinkle> Radu: and why do you say only twi is being bad?
<Airpuff> Its pretty much the same as the episode with twilight.. but they just make her look so bloody bad -.-
<DrGNs> hey Guys
<RyunosukeKnT> after the Trixie incident, RD should have learned about boasting ;)
<IshBestPony> why does mai housekey smell like ass?
<GameTaco> Show of power!
<Qelix> oh brother
<CupcakeWarrior> And then otakon would start a threesome with them
<Qelix> dat voice

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spike didn't like being babied by Rarity, which was OOC of Spike IMO.
<Malavolent> Oh boy, fans of different ponies are fighting.
<DrGNs> :O PONIES?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
<Roflbot> Unicorns op
<RainbowAsh> Nittany_Discord, I disliked Putting Your Hoof Down, as Fluttershy was just as one-dimensional in it as Dash is in this one.
<MahBoi777> umm...
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Aww yeah, those episodes definitely overshadow this one.:)
<Ninjazz> Ugh... WHY DO WE WATCH THIS EPISODE WHEN ALL IT CAUSES IS ARGUMENTS?!
<GameTaco> Yaaay~

<Radu> Talking is the key to solving things.
<RainbowAsh> Nittany_Discord, I thought Spike's reaction to Rarity was in character, because it happened just when his self image as a dragon was pulled into question

<Very_Silly_Filly> Guys, do I have a brain made of steel? Because I've had the 3DS's 3D on for 3 hours straight and no eyesore or headache, and I can see perfectly.

<Ghosties> 04Just show the OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD part
<SuperBrony64> 11,022.4/10
<MahBoi777> AWESOME

<Nittany_Discord> 11,011
<Ghosties> 04Troll 2

<String_Shredder> inafter OH MY GOOOOOOOD spam
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Alright, pony episodes...
<prince-dari> Just loop that clip for an hour
<DashWithRainbows> 2.4!?
<DashWithRainbows> Jesus...
<Ghosties> 04That's the only thing anybody knows from that film
<Meanwhile> That film sucks
<kenne> troll 1 got like a 1.8 i think
<Rukario> there one of them finally shut down, now only running 3
<Meanwhile> Horribly.
<otakon> This will be the first and LAST time Troll 2 is shown
<MahBoi777> low
<otakon> kenne: actually the first troll wasn't too bad
<LordDerpington> Nah, WMC is for stuff that's both bad and not entertaining.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I might not even know that part.
<Midnight_Fyre> And it should be lower than 2.4, but people ironically vote it up
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Number 127: pikorar
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Fall Weather Friends
<otakon> LordDerpington: yeah, but Troll 2 IS bad and unentertaining
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hasn't been shown in a while.
<otakon> doesn't even deserve to be called Troll 2
<ScootaChicken> otakon: YOU CAN'T PISS ON HOSPITALITY]
<IshBestPony> YEAH
<SlurryMoon> 3nice
<nickstr> but think of it this way drf, would you like to be able to back up your data in one fell swoop in case your internal hard drive crashed?
<kenne> nvm its 3.8
<otakon> ScootaChicken: lol
<Midnight_Fyre> kenne: no, Troll 1 (which is completely unrelated to Troll 2) is a much better film
<SlurryMoon> 3I haven't seen that one in months
<nickstr> or have some extra storage without breaking out the screwdriver?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02165: DSNesmith
<kirzstryfe> 1,3nah, we can't have that pick, it makes pikorar happy, and that's not allowed
<Midnight_Fyre> It's still bad, but much better than Troll 2
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: thank you, the story is more coherent and the FX ar better
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sisterhooves Social
<SlurryMoon> 3also nice :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OK.
<ScootaChicken> It's better than Troll 2, but less entertaining than Troll 2.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02That's all for the lottery today ponies!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We'll take this as our next movie pick.
<IshBestPony> lol pikorars not allowed to be happy
<LordDerpington> Yeesh, that was an ordeal.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3A Movie: The Silence of the Lambs - derpy_pony
<kirzstryfe> 1,3B Movie: Troll 2 - LucidDream
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Pony 1: Fall Weather Friends - pikorar
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Pony 2: Sisterhooves Social - DSNesmith
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: plus it has a character named Harry Potter who defeats an evil being with magic :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Stay tuned for a special event, an interview with Babble with Bronies!
<otakon> ScootaChicken: Troll 2 is a bad film and you should fell bad.
<ScootaChicken> Who's pikorars?
<fluttercry> 05,15THIS LOTTERY IS HAXED! I'M UNSUBSCRIBING!
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: this was BEFORE teh books by teh way
<ScootaChicken> otakon: The Room is also a bad film, but we all love it.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> A MOD DIDNT WIN
<otakon> WAY before the books
<Midnight_Fyre> yep
<IshBestPony> Eat the Rich foar B movie
<otakon> ScootaChicken: I hated that "movie" with a passion
<kenne> now time for the interview thingy
<ScootaChicken> otakon: But they're both incredibly entertaining.
<ScootaChicken> They epitomise the phrase 'so bad it's good'
<Radu> Ponies.
<mitamaking> +m over?
<Cobellanez> Scoot Scoot scoota-bell
<mitamaking> Bummer you didn't get to me the way A-movies were falling
<Very_Silly_Filly> FINALLY, I can talk now! God, I was so tempted to make so many silly comments during your lottery. -_-
<kenne> now im just waitiing for the crow to get picked for A movie
*Kipkat07_Mare hugs SuperBrony64
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when this lottery was so very much like the early days I actually got nostalgic?
<Ninjazz> Sisterhooves Social FTW
<CrimsonPhoenix> HELLO EVERYONE
<JoseEnriquez> That was just ridiculous
*SuperBrony64 hugs Kipkat07_Mare
<RankWinner> Aanndd we're back
<RAWRity> 4 FUCKING TIMES. Holy crap people do not know how A movies work.
<JoseEnriquez> Oh hai CrimsonPhoenix
<Storm_Charger> hey
<CreativePonyName> were back :)
*Kipkat07_Mare noms SuperBrony64's mane
<Very_Silly_Filly> My god, that was the SILLIEST roll ever
<Whiskra> (me facepalms at fail lottery submissions
<JoseEnriquez> ^
<Litwick> Can we switch to LimeV now?
<The_Si> I'll get B Movie one day! *evil laugh*
<StinkomanFan> Anypony find the pony referance in the Aquabats yet?]
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Ask yourself that question.
<Shane377> omg omg movies yay!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Competition week-end next
<Midnight_Fyre> Is The Crow A?
<Renard> Thank you for *not* choosing Appolo18 - it _sucks_.
<Ninjazz> Dat 4th roll :D
<Sundaysmile> was a shame apollo 18 wasn't shown
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm excited :D
<Qelix> so...ehhh. how does the lottery work?
<FillyFlam> I think we need a Bronystate guide to A movies. Since there seems to be some confusion.
<Roflbot> hang on...
<JoseEnriquez> Good thing I'm not signed up
<Very_Silly_Filly> I liked apollo 18
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: I wasn't asking a question
<LordDerpington> Hmm... borderline.
<Sundaysmile> silence of the lambs is a good substitute though
<Roflbot> we decided no apollo 18.. but we got troll 2?
<CreativePonyName> troll 2 ftw
<Obsidian> Interview Time
<Very_Silly_Filly> and I cried when you turned down zombieland
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://i.imgur.com/vGp2t.jpg
<Rukario> ouuu
<fluttercry> 05,15FillyFlam check our FAQ
<Kipkat07_Mare> SuperBrony64: soooooooooooo many rerolls. the intermission ended before B pick :D
<PrincessDismo> Roflbot: Oh my goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
<RAWRity> Roflbot: Troll 2 was in the right category
<MisterBen> I chose Pirates of the Carribean for the A movie myself
<prince-dari> All you need to do is IMDb your film
<Midnight_Fyre> I always thought of it as a cult film
<prince-dari> Check rating and budget
<kirzstryfe> 1,3imdb > 7.0 or rotten tomatoes > 80%
<Whiskra> thres a difference between APOLLO 18 and APOLLO 13, they're not the same movie
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Oh, my bad. It looked like a question.
<IshBestPony> should I get Graffiti Burger or HoundDogs pizza
<Litwick> Yeah, that's kind of hypocrtical. We say no to Apollo, yet we get Troll 2.
<pony_4588> . 1 B, avoids confusion...:/
<DasPinkie> I chose Bat 1989man
<kenne> Midnight_Fyre: should be
*Meanwhile hugs RAWRity.
<Roflbot> Apollo 13 was about the miracle that happened with the astronauts
<fluttercry> 05,15Litwick nope. because Troll 2 was in the right catagory
<GameTaco> We get trolled?
<RainbowAsh> Litwick, there are different rules for A and B
<EccoCode> !pokemon
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: don't let trixie see. She might get jealous
<ScriptBot> EccoCode, you are a 12Amoonguss.
<Ninjazz> B movie
<Radu> Alright, good night everyone c:
<Roflbot> If i nominated The
<twilight_sprinkle> Qelix: you need to subscribe for bronystate lottery ticket emails
<PrincessDismo> Troll2 was only picked for that stupid fucking like, I know it.
<Cobellanez> Night Radu
<EccoCode> D:
<Midnight_Fyre> IshBestPony: Do you live in Columbus?
<PrincessDismo> line*
<Ninjazz> Gnight Radu
<Roflbot> If i nominated The Matrix For B movie.... would it get turned down????????????
<IshBestPony> Midnight_Fyre yesh
<Shizuschlafen> 13yes
<pony_4588> they should just show two movies, instead of 1 A and one B...distinction seems silly to me
<JoseEnriquez> Night Radu don't let NMM or Molestia bite
<IshBestPony> Midnight_Fyre are you a spy
<RAWRity> Roflbot: yep
<Shizuschlafen> 13because the matrix is an a movie
<Pale_Horse> The problem with Apollo 18 is that it's not really good, or so bad you can make fun of it.... it's just Meh.
<MahBoi777> pizzaaaaaaa
<Midnight_Fyre> Knew it! :D
<Shamroc> hey kirzstryfe zombies/
<Roflbot> fine The Matrix Revolution it is
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Wait, columbus Ohio?
<Midnight_Fyre> Go for the Hound Dog's
<kenne> Midnight_Fyre: budget of 15M and rating of 7.5 seems like it to me
<GameTaco> Problem, Mr. Anderson?
<DrGNs> What would Robin hood men in tights be?
*DeathStar dances
<Rukario> great
<Shizuschlafen> 13which based on budget and return is also A
<RAWRity> DrGNs: B. and we've showed it before
<Rukario> so these two computers work
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The Matrix is definite A.
<Midnight_Fyre> I used to go to OSU, so I lived in Columbus for a while. Now I'm up near Cleveland
<RX-78-SweetieBot> IshBestPony: Columbus, Ohio?
<fluttercry> 05,15DrGNs probably B
<Rukario> so it's something i'm forgetting
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sequels less so.
<IshBestPony> yes RX
<Roflbot> What about the Matrix Revolution?
<Roflbot> it never made sense
<DasPinkie> Imma leave it here tonight everypony, see you all tomorrow!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Well shit, Im just over in Hilliard
<Rukario> hiii
<Meanwhile> I think I may have found a new B movie to vote for.
<SlurryMoon> 3We haven't shown men in tights before RAWRity
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: No, they're still definitely A movies. Budgets were HUGE
<Meanwhile> Which is tragic because my old one hasn't been shown yet.
<DeathStar> bye DasPinkie
<Obsidian> Bye DasPinkie
<Pale_Horse> Waterworld had a huge budget. :P
<Ninjazz> I have such a B movie. I ain't changing votes until it gets shown.
<MahBoi777> ?
<Meanwhile> What a dilema.
<Shizuschlafen> 13like back to the future, matrix 2 and 3 only work together as one film
<Midnight_Fyre> Did either of you go to the meetup in Cleveland a month or so ago?
<Shizuschlafen> 13on their own the plot is fractured
<Shiro> hiiii~
<fluttercry> 05,15what are your two picks?
<otakon> RAWRity: huge budget does NOT just qualify for a A movie, Apollo 18 had low budget AND low ratings, it's Z tier.
<drf|away_SchoolPC> 02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Havent gotten around to looking at local meetups yet
<Litwick> Voting Troll 2 for Z tier.
<fluttercry> 05,15A is budget AND ratings
<RAWRity> otakon: I'm talking about the matrix sequels
<Derpy_Hooves> hopefully i get picked sometime in the future :3
<DrGNs> Silent Hill?
<MadSurge> I would vote for Braindead, but I don't know where it is
<Derpy_Hooves> i picked the movie "red"\
<Meanwhile> I don't want to name this new one, but the old one...Grr. I've been tight lipped aboutthat one as well.
<Sundaysmile> troll 2 will be good fodder for parody
<MahBoi777> RED is a great movie
<Roflbot> hm... how did Titanic 2 never become WMC
<otakon> RAWRity: oh, well I guess.......The Matrix is way better then the last two movies though
<fluttercry> 05,15Dead Alive/Brain Dead would be a B
<TheWalrusCancer> Well, I saw what I came for. Goodbye everypony!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> You have to say one of them Meanwhile
<Derpy_Hooves> Mahboi777 IKR?
<FaithHeart> I hope we soon get Zombie Ponies
<Shizuschlafen> 13matrix 3 enjoys a 6.5 on IMDB, which is higher than some As we've shown
<IshBestPony> the bakery I work at had me go to an autism fundraiser last night to give outs samples, lots of rich ponies there, and in my head I was playing fun games such as: Spot the Plastic Surgery, Botox or Notox, and my favorite, Real or Fake: Booby Edition
<otakon> MahBoi777: it IS! my GOD RED is a great movie
<Pale_Horse> Cause Titanic 2 was a blast to MST3K
<Litwick> We haven't really seen a lot of animated films picked for the Movie Night so far.
<Evo_Kaer> intermissions over again
<Meanwhile> For the past year I have kept the title of my B movie a secret, but now that I might swap it...
<Ninjazz> RED is an amazng movie!
<otakon> Shizuschlafen: how you been today dear?
<PrincessDismo> Shizuschlafen: I agree 100% I can't only watch BTTF 1 without watching 2 and 3. That's why I hope it never gets picked for movie night,
<MadSurge> Then it will be my B movie choice fluttercry
<MahBoi777> YES
<mario_pony> what movies won?
<SirGanjalf> I'd vote for "The Moon", but i'm not sure which category it belongs too.
<Midnight_Fyre> That was the first one I went to, and probably the only one I will for a long time since I can't really travel too far in my current financial situation
<FaithHeart> Silence of the Lambs and Troll 2
<SuperBrony64> 11,02ALright, give us a few min
<JoseEnriquez> Prepare your emulators bronies... We're in for a long movie
<Whiskra> that feel when my movie renderer has been on 99% for 2½ hours...
<Ninjazz> Just how long?...
<Roflbot> =/
<twilight_sprinkle> and now for....the b movie...."shivers"
<otakon> PrincessDismo: email bronystate and ask that we have a trilogy night once a week during the dry pony free summer
<Bronysith> JoseEnriquez i is playing my chrono trigger
<Roflbot> clop clop clop
<Renard> I'd propose Amadeus
<Litwick> everypony..... run.
<DrGNs> 0____0
<FaithHeart> this B movie is so weird
<MadSurge> What movie are we in for?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Heh, thats largely why I havent gone looking for any meetups yet Midnight_Fyre
<derpy_pony> this movie is actually very good
<Litwick> Run from this film.
<JoseEnriquez> It's not that it's long.... it's just that it's so terrible it feels long
<twilight_sprinkle> Renard: oh thats a good one, i thought of proposing that too
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: Slither is good, isn't SHivers about the parasites that make you a sex fiend?
<DavidCortez> I could stare at this pic forEVER. :)
<FaithHeart> I hope you all like subtitles
<Derpy_Hooves> Mahboi777 RED is one of the very FEW movies where humor and action mix really well, know what i mean?
<Sundaysmile> what's the flic?
<Roflbot> wingboner
<fluttercry> 05,15I really like her.....mane
<pony_4588> Next movie is supposedly good...yet shown as B..:/
<Ninjazz> Is that?...
<DavidCortez> I could stare at this pic forEVER.
<FaithHeart> and native German speakers will love it
<JoseEnriquez> well not that terrible but entertaining enough to kill time
<Ninjazz> Is that?...
<Whiskra> I remember when someone drew that on stream... I think
<ScootaChicken> fluttercry: What would a film with a really high budget but a really low rating be?
<Ninjazz> SB?
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: .....what
<DrGNs> 90's horror flic about a detective
<ScootaChicken> Or vice versa?
<Litwick> The pacing is just so SLOW. If the pacing was a little faster I wouldn't mind but.... good CELESTIA.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: you never seen Slither?
<ScootaChicken> Actually vice versa would probably be a B
<Meanwhile> Hmm. What's the lowest "high" rating for a film on imdb?
<fluttercry> 05,15pony_4588 it's BORING
<RainbowAsh> ScootaChicken, Twilight
<pony_300> Any chance someone saved all of Ghosties's chapter titles from last night??
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: no
<Dashie_Dashie> We should stream Titanic 2 again.
<Midnight_Fyre> Can't afford a hotel room, and I won't share one with a bunch of people who stay up partying until 5:00 am because I'll never sleep and my car is junk, so I don't trust myself to drive it far
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: squick horror movie witha bit of comedy
<Kandarihu> ScootaChicken: a waste of money
<pony_4588> Im not easily bored
<derpy_pony> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068182/ b movie
<MahBoi777> Derpy_Hooves: yes, it's one of the few awesome action movies out there
<Rukario> laggy
<pony_4588> if the movie is any good
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: havent seen it
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: it's a little slow but has high gross out factor
<ScootaChicken> RainbowAsh: I'm asking for A and B categorisations.
<Litwick> I'd rather watch the Gen 1 MLP movie than Aguille again.
<Roflbot> Ya how did Aquire be a B movie with 8.1????????????????
<Obsidian> pony_4588: oh you will be....YOU WILL BE
<Roflbot> MOD LOGIC
<ScootaChicken> (mostly because I want to vote for Twilight but I'm not sure which category to put it in)
<otakon> Roflbot: it's a cult film and ValtheJean's pick.
<ScootaChicken> You didn't just read that.
<DrGNs> Napolean Dynamite has to be an A
<ValtheJean> 2,14 rating isn't everything
<pony_4588> well see :)
<Roflbot> so..
<ScootaChicken> That's totally not my evil plan.
<Roflbot> thats lies
<twilight_sprinkle> im surprised nobody is voting Harry Potter 7 part 2
<FlareChaser> Was playing L4D2, we all ragequit'd
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and besides, when you desire to claw your eyes out of boredom, then you'll understand
<Litwick> It buffered again. I'd recommend switching to another stream source so that way these ponies can suffer through every moment of it :)
<otakon> Roflbot: it's REALLY a damn eccestation(I cna't spleel today)
<drf|osx> o.o
<pony_300> I really don't get why Aguire was supposed to be a good movie, definitely must've missed something
<MadSurge> Great, german movie .__.
<otakon> Litwick: they are setting up
<Ninjazz> That's why chat is here... Right?
<Roflbot> i dont know if i should refresh or unpause this picture
<Roflbot> =/
<drf|osx> and now time for Fairly OddParents
<Starflash> sooooo
<otakon> Ninjazz: Ghosties kept us going last night with his chapters
<MahBoi777> now I want to see the movie RED again, lol
<Starflash> this B movie has an 8.1
<Shane377> Caillin u still there
*IshBestPony will get graffiti burger
<drf|osx> yay watching children's cartoons at 21 :P
<derpy_pony> the circle of buffering
<Meanwhile> Gah ffs I can't find a budget on this movie.
<otakon> Chapter 1: THE BUFFER CIRCLE!
<Starflash> Now I'm interested.
<Ninjazz> Chapters of what?
<Ninjazz> Oh.
<Dark_Horst> hm... is it playing? i'm buffering round and round
<Ninjazz> :D
<Meanwhile> How'm I supposed to know whether it's A or B?!
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm suprised no one got a number for Harry Potter
<RainbowAsh> So... is there anything going to happen now?
<Obsidian> Will u help us agains Ghosties?
<otakon> Meanwhile: it's a B for sure
<Midnight_Fyre> pony_300: It's the sort of movie you need to devote all of your attention to. It can't really be appreciated in a chat setting
<Lil_B> I just noticed the N64 controller-Cute Mark... could be my Cute-mark :/
<otakon> Meanwhile: its a damn speech is what it is
<Meanwhile> Not the one showing, this one I found while looking for a new movie
<twilight_sprinkle> Spell-of-Gaming: "thats what i said ya crazy cunt hehehe"
<otakon> Meanwhile: what is it?
<Meanwhile> Can't say.
<Pale_Horse> Original NES controller cutie mark is superior. :P
<MadSurge> Mine would be a generic joystick Lil_B
<IshBestPony> where da stream at?
<Ninjazz> Ehhh. Harry Potter is too mainstream.
<otakon> Meanwhile: then HOW can I help you find out if it's A or B then?
<Roflbot> im going to nominate Twilight as a B movie
<Meanwhile> NO ONE CAN HELP ME.
<otakon> IshBestPony: they are setting it up
<Spell-of-Gaming> twilight_sprinkle: :P
<IshBestPony> Ninjazz = hipster
<Roflbot> and ill pick the LONGEST one
<otakon> brb need more noms
<Roflbot> hahahahahha
<twilight_sprinkle> i still havent seen harry potter 7 part 2
<DrGNs> TWILIGHT??!?!?!?!!?!??!?!?
<MadSurge> Arcade-style joystick
*Skylands listened to DRF's show the other night :P
<nickstr> as did I
*Ninjazz puts on glasses
<RainbowAsh> Roflbot, be careful, though. I heard the last one was partially watchable
<Ghosties> 04Probably not, that B movie took the most out of me
<IshBestPony> otakon x nom
<drf|osx> nice
<drf|osx> did you like it?
<Skylands> 10I recognized all the songs pretty much
<Obsidian> awww
<Roflbot> hahaha 5.3 AND PPL STILL WATCH THE SERIES
<Skylands> 10Yrp
<IshBestPony> s
<Skylands> 10Yep*
<Evo_Kaer> Twilight is not a B Movie, it's a S-movie --> Suicide movie
<drf|osx> yay XD
<derpy_pony> will there be a movie?
<Roflbot> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1099212/
<nickstr> dance music is unusual on the radio
<twilight_sprinkle> Ghosties: Chapter 101: The re-run
<Starflash> Sooo is B movie worth it or not?
<Shamroc> ni
<drf|osx> which is exactly why I'm doing it
<Shamroc> no no no
<Shane377> Evo_Kaer: i agree
<Ninjazz> Oi! Twilight is pony, not an terrible movie.
<MadSurge> Twilight is an R movie, as in Rifftrax movie
<nickstr> you might be filling a niche
<IshBestPony> Starflash I heard not
<Obsidian> Yes
<Meanwhile> I wonder...this could probably pass as an A movie.
<nickstr> this is why some people like college radio
<Meanwhile> I could have my cake AND eat it.
<nickstr> niche formats
<Onyxia> wat happenned to the stream?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I didn't know the lottery was this early, because it's around 3:00 am in my place
<Starflash> where did it get its high rating from :T
<Litwick> Someone should request Twilight JUST to troll us.
<drf|osx> the problem is going to be getting enough songs for the upcoming weeks
<drf|osx> I have enough for next week but that's about all the music I have
<fluttercry> 05,15We're setting up for the interview mentioned in the newsletter that you should all know about
<IshBestPony> eat the rich foar B movie
*DeathStar dances
<Evo_Kaer> I qwonder if the mods would take it
<Obsidian> Great Now you gave them ideas
<MadSurge> YES, INTERVIEW!
<DeathStar> fluttercry: oh
<derpy_pony> oh
<Shamroc> ....question is it buffering for others?
<twilight_sprinkle> wait, so no B movie?
<Obsidian> yay
<Onyxia> thats wat i was waiting for .. so cool
<otakon> yeah
<Evo_Kaer> interview?
<otakon> it's still setting up
<IshBestPony> Shamroc for everypony
<Shane377> Litwick: and if they do (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻) table will be flipped
<Shamroc> ahh
<IshBestPony> otakon x Shamroc
<twilight_sprinkle> wow no B movie, you eurobronies are lucky
<GameTaco> Not sure if I should stay for it... I *had* plans for today. Hm.
<Shamroc> IshBestPony...wat?
<Rukario> finally
<Rukario> i think success
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Indeed they are
<Randomnerd> Of course, I haven't watched a single thing on here all day, I'd rather chat.
<MadSurge> I'm going out in an hour anyway
<Midnight_Fyre> ValtheJean: If you want to claw your eyes out from boredom check out Silent Light. It's much slower than Aguirre, a lot less happens, it doesn't even have an interesting setting, and it's almost an hour longer
<otakon> oh it's the interview THEN the B movie
<Lil_B> WHAT?! No B Movie? I want to see Klaus Kinski!
<Randomnerd> mips.tv sucks.
<Starflash> Yeah.
<IshBestPony> then otakon sexy tiem
<pony_4588> I was looking forward to this :/
<otakon> IshBestPony: what?
<Rukario> i got the welcome to <domain> window
<Midnight_Tempest> what is this interview?
<FlareChaser> Guys, dont refresh the page.
<IshBestPony> otakon x everypony
<Shamroc> otakon...just now heard of the interview like 4 minutes ago from kirz....
<twilight_sprinkle> the B movie sucked
<Midnight_Fyre> That B movie was awesome
<GameTaco> At least thanks to sticking around I can finally cross Monty Python and the Holy Grail off my to-do list.
*CupcakeWarrior|Food is back with Subway
<Roflbot> i cant refresh
<Shane377> that was that bad of a movie
<RainbowAsh> Roflbot, you can. It just doesn't help
<Ninjazz> I didn't see the ending of Holy Grail
<Lil_B> the stream is giving me a Website offline :/
<Shane377> ive seen worse *cough twlight
<GameTaco> Next on my list... Krull?
<RyunosukeKnT> lil same
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: They get arrested. THE END
<FillyFlam> Shane377: At least stuff happens in Twilight.
<Roflbot> KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHN
<Obsidian> Same here
<Ninjazz> MadSurge: :O
<RandomExtra> Yep.
<CupcakeWarrior> And then the website crashes
<twilight_sprinkle> the B movie just isnt for theaters
<Shamroc> eek
<MadSurge> Not kidding
<twilight_sprinkle> its for historians maybe
<Bronysith> CupcakeWarrior|Food i enjoy their meatball subs
<Ninjazz> :O
<Shamroc> must not press f5!
<twilight_sprinkle> it seemed realistic, but not something for this place
<MadSurge> And then the movie trolls you with organ music :D
<Ninjazz> You guys are scaring me... Is the B movie THAT bad? It got an 8.2
<FillyFlam> Yes.
<Shane377> FillyFlam: http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/demotivational-posters-one-of-these-is-incredibly-gay.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: its what i said
<fluttercry> 05,15Ninjazz it's REALLY REALLY BORING
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: It sucks. IT really sucks.
<FaithHeart> Ninjazz, it's boring
<Meanwhile> It sucks like a black hole with a smoothee
<Pale_Horse> What sucks?
<MadSurge> Sounds boooring
<NightSeas> 02I liked it. Didn't have to listen to the same songs you everyday
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: not for ordinary audiences, its for people interested in history
<FaithHeart> the chat was way more entertaining
<Ninjazz> Im going to need ALOOOOOOOOT of coffee...
<Shamroc> wonder why the site downed
<pony_300> Ghosties looks inactive. I pray for your souls during the showing of this movie
<DeathStar> FaithHeart: it almost allways is
<pony_4588> Without wanting to sound arrogant...it just might be that this here is the wrong crowd for this kind of movie..:/
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: it was sort of like a representatino of conquistador raids
<Midnight_Fyre> Ninjazz: It's one of the best films ever shown on Bronystate. I'm serious
<Meanwhile> Screw it, I'm trying that movie I found as A next time.
<NightSeas> 02hear*
<otakon> oh godammit
<fluttercry> 05,15twilight_sprinkle I'm going to college FOR history, and I still hated it
<Ninjazz> lol
<otakon> I think the site is down
<Meanwhile> For now though, I require tea. My dapperness levels are low.
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_4588: thats what i said
<Midnight_Fyre> pony_4588: I think you are right
<pony_4588> I collect movies and this movie was on my to- do..i was thrilled when I saw they streamed it here^^
<Shamroc> otakon: yeppers
<Ninjazz> Ehhh.
<otakon> Meanwhile: you are at 50% dapper atm?
<Ninjazz> Midnight_Fyre: Why did you like it?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I assume the homepage is being updated? It shows an error that says 'The website is online'
<Kandarihu> Hmm, I refreshed and I got an error page from Cloudflare.
<Meanwhile> That counts as low.
<FaithHeart> So am I the only one whose stream is buffering?
<Lil_B> Ninjazz 1/3 of the budget got spent just on Klaus Kinski, the crew almost starved during the producton, if the natives hadn't helped them
<Kandarihu> Website currently unavailable
<Meanwhile> I can't go below 50% because of the moustache.
<Obsidian> Mine is too
<drf|osx> I might do some early 2000s stuff too, as those were still great XD
<drf|osx> like ATC - Around the World
<twilight_sprinkle> fluttercry: well its also about movie taste of course
<Ninjazz> Lil_B: Holy crap...
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> same here Kandarihu
<IcryAlot> not mine lol
<drf|osx> was my favorite song for a long itme
<drf|osx> I*Time
<Ninjazz> Now I am scared...
<CupcakeWarrior> And of course Meanwhile likes tea
<RainbowAsh> FaithHeart, they are setting stuff up. I guess this could take a bit longer
*DeathStar dances on buffer
<FaithHeart> okay
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah i see
<Obsidian> What u got IcryAlot ?
<FaithHeart> thanks RainbowAsh
<pony_300> hmm... refresh isn't working..... is God trying to save us from The Wrath of Aguirre?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I assume it's being updated for the news
<twilight_sprinkle> fluttercry: maybe you dont like slow movies like that, some people do, just like classical literature is "slow" compareed to modern adventure stuff
<Kandarihu> pony_300: ROFL
<Bronysith> i like tea CupcakeWarrior
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: he IS British
<NightSeas> 02you should also do some stuff by UB40
<otakon> I like tea too, but cold
<SuperBrony64> 11,02HANG IN THERE EVERYPONY! :>
<IcryAlot> Obsidian; the buffering wheel
<Bronysith> stereotypes ftw
<drf|osx> yeah, one of my friends suggested that
<Randomnerd> I drink coffee.
<Midnight_Fyre> Ninjazz: Hard to say exactly why I like a movie. Actually I had seen it a few times before last night. It's beautiffully shot, has interesting characters and an interesting setting. The premise is decent. Hard to really put my finger on it
<Randomnerd> Lots of it.
<otakon> This website is offline
<drf|osx> hence why I made a thread for suggestions :P
<Sundaysmile> can do
<Bronysith> i drink water
<otakon> oh dammit
<Spell-of-Gaming> I need a 1.5 mbps download speed
<Bronysith> and milk
<Pale_Horse> I can't hold on! I don't gots no thumbs!
<Ninjazz> i cant! my ha- hooves are slipping!
<FaithHeart> spin spin spin the wheel of destiny
<Randomnerd> Water?
<NightSeas> 02XD
<IshBestPony> IS THE STREAM READY YET?!!
<otakon> Randomnerd: I like coffee too, I drink alot of it
*DeathStar hangs in there on SuperBrony64 s head
<otakon> IshBestPony: no, the site is down atm too.
<Evo_Kaer> its THE RING
<Ninjazz> Midnight_Fyre: Over all. You just don't know.
<Spell-of-Gaming> That would be a good after-birthday present :P
<Randomnerd> Bah, I only drink that when it's ot and run through coffee grounds.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> THE SYSTEM IS DOWN
<Lil_B> Ninjazz they litterely went deep into the jungle and shot that movie no matter what XD, aslo the director needed a lot of monkeys for a scene, so he went into a town and claimed to be a animal doctor
*Randomnerd probably has a heart attack brewing.
<derpy_pony> the star of the show is not ready for an interview yet
<otakon> I drink water
<IshBestPony> I don't normally ship ponies, but when I do, it's with otakon
*Evo_Kaer is listening to MCChris - Discord
<Ninjazz> Lil_B: You're kidding... :O
<otakon> I like a cold glass of water
<Midnight_Fyre> It's an art film. Imagine watching something like 2001: A Space Odyssey here. It would be hard to appreciate a film like that in this setting even though it is considered a masterpiece
<otakon> oh goddammit what have I done
<twilight_sprinkle> like i said, its not an action movie for average audiences, its a movie for specific audiences
<otakon> inb4
<Ninjazz> True...
<IshBestPony> otakon x cold glass of water
<otakon> SEE?!
<pony_300> The best part about the movies was someone quoting behind the scenes facts and trivia
<Shamroc> funny
<pony_4588> space odyssey <3
<diddutz> HAL 9000?
<derpy_pony> we need a psychiatrist and a jar of japaleno pepper
<twilight_sprinkle> Midnight_Fyre: ah ive seen that movie and read the book, it was nice, although the movie is kidna slow
<Vinyl> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l7g76Mx2_cg/TcZLUiHpwZI/AAAAAAAAEPs/YFD3fiNnK7w/s1600/whylauren.png
<Bronysith> otakon x IshBestPony
<Midnight_Fyre> pony_300: unfortunately, I used up most of my fun facts last night
<IshBestPony> otakon x Bronysith
<Vinyl> How did i just learn this. ._.
<Randomnerd> lol good inb4, otakon
<Midnight_Fyre> Most of them I got by watching the director's commentary
<twilight_sprinkle> Vinyl: thats season 1
<otakon> oh dear GOD stop shipping me with every conceivable thing!
<Lil_B> Ninjazz you are german right? or is my memory wrong?
<FillyFlam> Honest to god, the facts about the movie's production are more interesting than the movie itself.
<NightSeas> 02you should play nothing but JB. See how long everyone last :'D
<RainbowAsh> Vinyl, saddest brony-related event ever. Still, the series held up fine without her
<MahBoi777> internet derp ugh
<CupcakeWarrior> otakon x mare do well
*SuperBrony64 picks up DeathStar and hugs her
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek poniez ^-^
<pony_300> great, so Midnight's facts is burnt out, and Ghosties is gone.... well, enjoy your Hell, ladies and gentlemen.
<Ninjazz> Lil_B: I am sorry, my friend. I am not. I am American.
<IshBestPony> otakon sorry, rule of the latest newsletter
<Vinyl> twilight_sprinkle if you read the whole thing she isn't working on it anymore. I just learned that. posted a while ago.
*DeathStar hugs SuperBrony64 back "so do I"
<Ghosties> 04NEVER
<kenne> otakon x conceptions?
<FlareChaser> Flare is back, back again.
<Obsidian> Me too
<Ghosties> 04I SHALL NEVER LEAVE
<Vinyl> RainbowAsh you can see the difference though :P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DAT
<SuperBrony64> 11,02GHOSTIES
<IshBestPony> otakon you have a bad habit of getting shipped with everything that moves
<MadSurge> RainbowAsh, at least she's doing other new stuff :)
<MahBoi777> otakon x otakon
<Vinyl> Not animation wise, though,
<Litwick> I can't see the stream
<Sumica> 00,10Hi all, how life the universe and everypony?
<pony_300> rofl
<DeathStar> Ghosties: forever a lerk
<Vinyl> Litwick refresh
<Obsidian> Good Sumica
<Ninjazz> About to be dreadful, Sumi.
<IshBestPony> otakon x his hand
<Litwick> I've refreshed like 5 times so far
<MadSurge> Hi Sumica!
<Lil_B> Ninjazz ok, then it was someone else XD, also an other weird fact, the director STOLE the camera for to make the movie
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Sumica, it's not good
<CupcakeWarrior> I already said that earlier
<Midnight_Fyre> Is anything playing?
<derpy_pony> "this website is offline"
<Starflash> What the hoof is goin on here...
<Vinyl> No Midnight_Fyre
<MahBoi777> hi Sumica
<derpy_pony> boring
<Ninjazz> Lil_B: NO WAY! :D
<IshBestPony> otakon x both hands
<Bronysith> otakon x luna

<Sumica> 00,10oh dear sound srs

*Meanwhile returns with tea.
<Meanwhile> We shipping otakon some more?
<Shane377> i got buffering circle of doom
<IshBestPony> otakon x Meanwhile's tea
<MahBoi777> tea time is best time
<Spell-of-Gaming> What the hell is 12 days with no computer? Are you kidding me?
<RainbowAsh> Vinyl, I am not sure, actually. I mean s2 is different in some ways, but then again series usually develop over time. I find it hard to lay my finger on what exactly would have been different with her onboard.
<DashWithRainbows> I have no idea...
<Midnight_Fyre> Ninjazz: He took it from his art school. He was in his late 20s when he made this movie
*Yahooz does 12 backflips into the chat
<otakon> I'd like some coffee
<Yahooz> i heard shipping
*Meanwhile bonks IshBestPony with a cinderblock.
<IshBestPony> otakon x Yahooz
<otakon> hiya Yahooz and you did
<Starflash> Ohai Yahooz. Nice flip thar.
<MahBoi777> who started the whole shipping otakon thing?
<otakon> see?
<Meanwhile> Leave my tea alone.
<otakon> MahBoi777: no idea
<IshBestPony> otakon x Cinderblock

<Ninjazz> Yes.
<Yahooz> you guys. Shizuka x Vivi ist only ship
<RaveBrony> Woah... just got back...the website is offline?
<Yahooz> deal with it
<IshBestPony> otakon lolololololol
<RainbowAsh> Ninjazz, now I am looking forward to it.
<Midnight_Fyre> The director's commentary was fascinating. The production was an adventure itself
<Meanwhile> But otakon, it had enough milk already :(
<MahBoi777> lol
<otakon> you DO realize that the love calculator NEVER works right on embedded chat right?
<Dark_Horst> i just refrshed. now it says site offline. what did i miss while iw as away?
<Shizuschlafen> 13Hi folks.
<IshBestPony> otakon is it your own "special" milk

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Shizuschlafen
<Shizuschlafen> 13At the moment CloudFlare will be reporting that the site is offline.
<otakon> IshBestPony: dear god man I don't have special milk.
<drf|osx> though we did play Rebecca Black to troll people xD

<Shibakuzou_WallDives> I dunno, that might be a stretch...
<FlareChaser> Bronysith: didnt...mention ME?
<otakon> Han shot first in the original movie however Lucas felt it didn't make him "heroic" enough as a first impression so they changed it later on
<Obsidian> Well Tabitha didnt know she was voicinga female pony
<Kammerjunk> hey criken ur a chikn
<Kammerjunk> Spike x Rarity = OTP
<otakon> Obsidian: yeah, she though Derpy was a boy at first, but that's besides the point. I still think the voice fit the first time

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Val only ships with Caramel.

<Obsidian> Nooooooo Ghosties

<DeathStar> Sumica: ikr? :(
<otakon> aka bow chikka wow woo
<Obsidian> yay
<Ninjazz> Hahaha
<otakon> lol
<alexxm> i am alive
<xles> I'm very interested in shipping myself. I mean, a parcel from across town takes three days, but I can get the same stuff shipped from hong kong in only two. How does that work?! ...nowait, what are we talking about?
<BronyJenkins> 3 Chats. One BronyJenkins. Buck, yes.
<otakon> Val despises fan EVERYTHING
<IshBestPony> I like otakon shipping
<Meanwhile> For good reason
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> I dont blame him.

<Dark_Horst> FUCK NO
<alexxm> no
<Obsidian> Bad Val Bad
<pony_300> epic NO
<ChrysalisandDiscord> I think it is safe to say, nopony agrees.
<IshBestPony> otakon x spike
<Kammerjunk> Well, in Val's defence, Spike IS a baby dragon, and Sweetie Belle IS a filly.
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> and the questions take a turn for the squicky.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sweetie Belle and Spike would be so cute together /)^3^(\
<Chrysalis> note he doesnt say no to this
<Sumica> 00,10no no Val was the one that went nooooooooooooooooooo
<Chrysalis> he must like the idea
<IshBestPony> ^
<Obsidian> Great now i need to scrub my brain
<Midnight_Fyre> They would cease to be the CMC if they get their cutie marks
<Kammerjunk> I agree, SB.
<otakon> Kammerjunk: well, he's a "baby" dragon but he's closer in mentality to a 10 year old I'd say, Sweetie the same
<Kammerjunk> otakon: Yes, exactly.
<NullRadix> Season 3 finale: Wrap up all the sideplots in 22 minutes. GO
<xles> I think the CMC will get a blank slate as their marks, because they have infinite potential.
<Ninjazz> Good points made.
<otakon> SuperBrony64: well they WERE dancing together at the end of S2 finale
<pony_300> tabula rasa
<Biglaw> I drew Bronysith as a pony. Not sur eim me hoofsta
<Meanwhile> It's Friday Friday, gotta get down Friday.
<Kammerjunk> Obviously, dragons, being a different species and all, don't have the same lifespan as a pony. I assume they have a much longer life expectancy.
<otakon> no
<Bronysith> Biglaw ty man
<otakon> i was AWAY

<RainbowAsh> That doesn't look save
<Narolas> I don't mind if there's no explosion, but seriously, i've seen it yesterday, it's incredibly boring, nothing happens, and it even tranforms into some sort of pathetic comedy at the end :p
<IshBestPony> Everlasting_Joy sparkle sparkle sparkle
<Damos> Wie is everyone?
<Ninjazz2> Oi. The MLP movie is awesome.
<Midnight_Fyre> It can't stop being boring if it never starts being boring

<Ninjazz2> What exactly did Ghosties do?
<Dark_Horst> ooooh, he mean
<Kipkat07_Mare> TheRainbowDash: heres your barrel *hands you a barrel of cider*
<otakon> Narolas: I agree
<Midnight_Fyre> I'll admit, Ghosties was entertaining

<Darkts3> what language is this movie in?
*Kipkat07_Mare drops a key to the cider cellar as she passes out from alcohol and boredom
<otakon> hello Golakka
<Midnight_Fyre> German
<Darkts3> ah
<alexxm> hey Golakka hows your day been
<Obsidian> Dont forget the flute guy
<otakon> Darkts3: at a guess it's danish or german
<Narolas> I mean, this movie isn't the worst, and i don't mind it being long or without "splosions and action scenes", it's just bad, especially near the end, it becomes funny because of the way it's filmed
<Spectrum_Rush> how risque showin your neck like that
<Very_Silly_Filly> Saturn the flute guy
<Golakka> Outstanding! Tickets just went on sale for http://www.bronyuk.org/
<Ninjazz2> Dat face
<Golakka> everything is brilliant!
<Scr3wball> Personally, the movie may be boring but it is strangely entertaining.
<Midnight_Fyre> It was originally filmed in English because that was a common language of the international cast, but later dubbed in German
<TheRainbowDash> (picks up the key that Kipkat07_Mare dropped, and just stares at it for 5 minutes)
<otakon> Narolas: one word monkies
<JRP2234|webchat> SuperBrony64: pm
<Narolas> But hey, watching bad movies is fun, i find it entertaining
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: WHERE THE HELL IS THE ORIGINAL ENGLISH ONE!?
<Darkts3> the thing is we've experienced so many action scenes and explosions in movies nowadays
<alexxm> TheRainbowDash can i have some cide
<Golakka> What on earth is this film?
<Narolas> when talking to other people about it
<TheRainbowDash> Golakka: Good to hear then! I'm doing well too!:)
<Darkts3> we're not used to this
<Dark_Horst> i'm quite surprised at how many people can't identify the basic european languages. is it always like this?
<Ninjazz2> No.
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Sure, have a cup! (hands you a cup of cider)
<Ninjazz2> I understand every language. I just can't speak it.
<Kandarihu> THUNDER
<Kandarihu> PONY
<Very_Silly_Filly> I can identify most euro language

*alexxm drinks TheRainbowDash s cider thanks
*DeathStar dances
*Kipkat07_Mare wakes up and stumbles over to the cellar and falls down the stairs
<otakon> Dark_Horst: well to the UNTRAINED SPEAKER like myself danish and german sound similar dammit
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: You're welcome.
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: The English one is terrible quality. Although English was the common language among the actors, they couldn't really speak it well, so it sounds terrible
<IshBestPony> SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: oh
<Narolas> I personally am a fan of a lot of psychological movies, i'm used to long movies that are considered boring ... this one is just terribly realised :p
<otakon> IshBestPony: Sparkle sparkle sparkle motherbucker!
<Dark_Horst> otakon: i don't speka any language besides german and english and i can still recognize them
<otakon> okay, back to ME3, see you there RX-78|FireEmblem

<Darkts3> Thats where Pollution was invented
<pony_2056> No you don't need to watch Avatar
<Phase4> and what i've heard of silence of the lambs does not sound good
<pony_2056> There are nice easter eggs if you did, though
<Midnight_Fyre> Val says he chose it because he hates it and wants us to share his misery, but I love this movie and had already seen it multiple times before last night
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: yep. it's on Hulu thanks to Viz
<Sumica> 00,10meh

<Dark_Horst> but how come it's yours? CUZ I SAID SO, DIE!
<MahBoi777> it's good, but there are some strange parts
<alexxm> is this a comedy
<Ninjazz> So what happened in the past 30 minutes? I was washing the dishes.
<Darkts3> ..... nope its a horror film

<OmegaMetroidBrony> *aren't
<SuperBrony64|NOMZ> 11,02Just think of every movie that takes place during the past as a movie set in the future after a global apocalypse and then they all become horror movies.
<ZombieBrony> I find this boring

<JRP2234|webchat> woops
<RAWRity> Midnight_Fyre: proving again that IMDB ratings are horse piss
<MahBoi777> Titanic 2 makes me laugh
<OmegaMaretroidBrony> lol
<alexxm> how was it Biglaw
<RankWinner> 8.1 from what, 19 review?
<OmegaMaretroidBrony> Titanic 2 needed Sea Ponies
<Obsidian> Headshot
<Darkts3> so... WHY THEY NO MAKE TITANIC 3
<Biglaw> what are we watching? and alexxm it was good
<Dark_Horst> he took an arrow to the head
<Midnight_Fyre> RAWRity: Film critics often put this among the best films ever made
<pony_950> she ded
<CCCP> TITANIC ANIMATED MOVIE!
<MahBoi777> Titanic 3: Iceberg's revenge
<OmegaMaretroidBrony> Titanic 420 bro @_@
<CCCP> lol
<RAWRity> Midnight_Fyre: proving that film critics don't know what they're talking about.
<Biglaw> Titanic 4: A New Boat
<Ninjazz> lol
<Darkts3> stop the Titanic please
<LauraP> Titanic 2: Return of the Iceberg
<MahBoi777> xD

<Spectrum_Rush> la la la lal la
<Biglaw> Titanic 5: Revenge of the Ship
<CCCP> Titanic 6: new bron cuties
<Darkts3> Stop

<CCCP> :)
<Dark_Horst> HE TALKS WITHOUT A LUNG
<Darkts3> what?
<Darkts3> LOGIC
<Obsidian> His head sounded like a volleyball
<FillyFlam> Dat ten?
<RAWRity> I'm not even a film student, but I can tell that the pacing is awful, the camera work is ridiculous, acting is barely present, and the editing is so haphazard it borders on incomprehensible.
<Midnight_Fyre> 198
<FillyFlam> Sorry I have the stream paused.
<RainbowAsh> Newsflash: It's a jungle. There are no walls.
<LauraP> So is this the new Avengers movie?
<Darkts3> Rawrity: Thats why its in german Derp
<CCCP> nice review
<pony_950> *155 years later* IM FREE
<Midnight_Fyre> RAWRity: Most critics, and myself, would disagree
<Marx> And Title Drop.
<alexxm> this guy looks like an ugly edge
<Marx> Well, I'll go pick it up.
<RAWRity> At least "Tree of Life" had the redeeming quality of having good cinematography. This is barely on the level of a student film shot on a camcorder.
<Biglaw> Did everypony see my rendation of Bronysith as a pony?
*Espeon yawns
<Darkts3> nope
<Ninjazz> No.
<MahBoi777> no
<Biglaw> http://fav.me/d4xzhg1
<Ninjazz> Ooo A link!
*Angel_Umbreon shoves a sock in Espeon's mouth
<Midnight_Fyre> This movie is meant to draw you in, which is sadly impossible when watching in a chat. It's not meant to be watched this way
<RaveBrony> This movie is still on? O_o
<Obsidian> Not bad
<Digitalis> ewwww
<LauraP> So if the movie is supposed to be historically accurate, how come they don't notice someone holding a camera to their face?
<prince-dari> Eating algae?
<Darkts3> BETTER THAN KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
<MahBoi777> lol nice Biglaw
<twilight_sprinkle> Midnight_Fyre: yep

<Ninjazz> DeathStar: Nothing at all.

<Kandarihu> You know what? I can never consider this movie to be boring. Surely it's moving at a snail's pace. But these people are on an adventure. Even though it ends in failure, it's better that it has a beginning middle and end.
<CCCP> Darkts3: but that doesn't mean your right
<MahBoi777> LauraP: cuz it looks cool i guess, lol
<DeathStar> LauraP: the ladys love it

*DeathStar dances
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: You must take care of yourself more, Dashie...
<RAWRity> 90 minutes of dull, poorly acted pallor, all for a shot of him firing himself out of a cannon. I could dig it.
<Digitalis> haha
<WindWhistler> Oh, if you're on Chapter 100, the movie must be almost over, right?
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: I know....I wanted to reattach to my head, but you ate it already...
<OmegaMaretroidBrony> If only he could start a fire
*alexxm dances with DeathStar
<twilight_sprinkle> i wouldnt say it was poorly acted
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> so, question on whether a movie is A or B.
<Midnight_Fyre> 10/10. Love it, but I wish it wasn't so short
<WindWhistler> WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE
<Kandarihu> It pretty much is over.
<WindWhistler> O U Midnight_Fyre

<SuperBrony64|NOMZ> 11,029/10, lost points cause Nicholas Cage wasn't in it
<prince-dari> I don't think it was as bad some people made it out to be
<Everlasting_Joy> SuperBrony64|NOMZ :D
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: It was the greatest completment I could ever give! :)
<WindWhistler> Nicholas Cage makes everything better
<FillyFlam> You're right, dari. It was worse.
<WindWhistler> also Johnny Depp
<MahBoi777> yes SB64 LOL
<prince-dari> But it's hardly the most riveting film.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Ok then...:D
<Narolas> It's not bad, it's just kinda poorly done in some places
