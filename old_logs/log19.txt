<Quanyails> 7Because she first said she hates lugia.us, and now she hates squiby.

<Ray> 02at this rate she'll get banned from every forum in the internet xD
<prince-dari> And they stopped the car for some reason, then an actor made to look like an 'alien' ripped the car door off (I suppose it was rigged beforehand), and took the driver away.
<lightumbreon> i hope so....someway....

<Lambda> how did you start watching it Stormy?
<Lambda> weren't you basically just curious what was so great about it?
<Stormy> yeah, pretty much
<Stormy> I kept seeing it everywhere
<Stormy> I thought it looked cute but there was no way half the internet could like it and not be trolling
<Stormy> hm, maybe everyone who likes it is trolling
<Stormy> and there are only a few who actually like it
<Lambda> are you guys trolling?
<Stormy> nope
<Stormy> but if I was, would I be likely to tell you?

<Ray> 02SoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo?
<Drake> 04So
<StarlitDusk> 12soap?
<HyperMetalLugia> Soap
<HyperMetalLugia> She/He was banned
<StarlitDusk> 12Who is Soap?
<Nick> Soap, throw a flashbang through the door!
<Nick> Soap whatever it is you're planning do it fast!
<StarlitDusk> 12I just said soap because it was sounding like "so"
<Nick> Soap ready for MW3?
<drf|laptop> 03this movie is so awesome
<Nick> Soap, what sort of name is that? How'd a muppet like you pass selection?
<drf|laptop> 03it's kinda bizarre but XD
<Ray> 02LOL MW3
<Ray> 02It will suck
<StarlitDusk> 12Soapity soap soap from Soaptown, Soapaina
<Nick> the teaser did :|
<Ray> 02Same game, another place, same guns, diferent skins.
<Nick> but yeah dont say it'll suck just cos its popular to hate COD now
<drf|laptop> 03also TIME PARADOXES AAHHHHHH
<StarlitDusk> 12huh
<drf|laptop> 03this is now like my third time watching this movie and there are still things I never noticed before
<drf|laptop> 03I have a friend over and we're watching a movie
<drf|laptop> 03called Déjà Vu
<Ray> 02actualy I just hate it because of Activision
<Nick> true
<Nick> they did kill off Guitar hero
<Ray> 02They have closed almost every other game seccion
<Ray> 02If CoD fails, they are done
<Nick> I guess the topic is the same as EA and command & Conquer/Red alert
<Ray> 02^
<Nick> one thing is for sure though, BF3 is looking epic and will challenge COD
<Nick> but yeah I've loved COD since the first game on PC, the love for that followed my love for MOH: Allied Assault
<Ray> 02It's fun just to sit, watch the flame wars, and then see how the Companies close. :3
<Nick> yeah
<StarlitDusk> 12This topic. O_o
<Ray> 02.-.
<Nick> but I've always enjoyed cod, and I cannot understand why a lot of ppl hate it now although now I can understand the reasons stated cos of activision etc
<StarlitDusk> 12I know what happens at the end of COD: black ops heh
<Nick> same here
<Nick> or starlit are you talking about the intel where even if you find some parts are still censored?
<HyperMetalLugia> INTEL INSIDE
<HyperMetalLugia> :3
<Nick> cos I have feelings theories about that
<HyperMetalLugia> And I hate CoD
<HyperMetalLugia> So boo
<Angel_Espeon> 13Cod is a fish
<Angel_Espeon> 13:<
<Ray> 02^
<Ray> 02CS 1.6 > almost every CoD
<Nick> HML did you play the first and second games?
<Nick> or the exp pack to the first?
<Ray> 02and wait.. CS is around 10 years old
<Ray> 02so that's actually funny :3
<HyperMetalLugia> No
<HyperMetalLugia> I never played them
<HyperMetalLugia> Since FPS are mostly Ew
<Ray> 02Also Changing Topic...
<Ray> 02Starlit how's your new PC? :3c
<Nick> well then, honestly if you didn't play COD 1, 2 and MW1 you won't know those games MP and SP are actually really good
<Nick> I agree recent times MP has become hacked and cheap
<Angel_Espeon> 13Why is my internet connection always dodgy during the night? >:/
<Espeon> 06:3c
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon

*Quanyails 7blinks.
<Quanyails> 7Ookay, Nick, what happened there.
<Quanyails> 7?*
<StarlitDusk> 12@DRF >_>
<StarlitDusk> 12And @Ray I have no idea. What is RAM?
<HyperMetalLugia> Starlit should give DRF the pic
<HyperMetalLugia> In hD
<HyperMetalLugia> HD
<Nick> what happened what quan?
<Stormy> Back
<Lambda> hey
<Stormy> I was helping Evan get ePSXe working
<Lambda> what's that?
<SilverSonic> LOL I think Starlit sent me an HD Pic of her XD
<Stormy> Never done it myself, so I consider that an accomplisment
<StarlitDusk> 12When?
<StarlitDusk> 12Ohhh
<SilverSonic> mhm
<StarlitDusk> 12@HML shut up
<Stormy> It's a psx emulator
<Lambda> psx?
<Umbreon> 12give drf the picture
<Umbreon> 12and he'll make it 3D for you
<Stormy> We're playing Spyro the Dragon on it
<Stormy> Playstation
<SilverSonic> Ignore them Starlit XD
<Lambda> oh, so like ps1
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> that's cool
<StarlitDusk> 12I think I will.
<Lambda> I found a website that legally sells some game music that is hard to find elsewhere
*StarlitDusk 12punts HML
<Stormy> We had to run around google downloading random dll files and crap to get it to work, but it works
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> sadly Spyro was not on it
<Lambda> nice
<Stormy> I feel smart now yay
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> I feel smart too
<Lambda> while you were gone I was insulting an AI
<Lambda> and arguing with it
<Quanyails> 7Oh, Nick, you just returned from /away. *late*
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> Did you know you could actually put PSX games in a computer's CD drive?
<Stormy> I had no idea until just now
<Lambda> woah, no I did not
<Stormy> but it works
<Nick> o-o
<Lambda> but then again, I didn't even know it was abbreviated PSX
<Lambda> I always just thought it was just PS
<Quanyails> 7 18:10:21		--- Nick is back
<Stormy> It's PS1 or PSX
<Stormy> PSX is the old one, I think
<Ray> 02@Starlit: Ram is abbreviation of Random Access Memory, a virtual memory to store data temporarily. The more ram you have, the faster your PC will be.
<Lambda> the fat one?
<StarlitDusk> 12How do I find out how much RAM I have?
*StarlitDusk 12starts to count sheep
<Lambda> Playstation Phat

<StarlitDusk> 12It says 1.00 GB of RAM
*StarlitDusk 12bleats

<prince-dari> Lol, Gummy.
<prince-dari> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130541320977.gif
<Charles> Just got done being dissapointed. Turns out I can't get my damned SATA connector into the motherboard without removing my monster of a Graphics card
<Jason> D:
*Jason steals the gfx card
<Jason> :))
<Charles> which will make formatting my netbooks HDD pretty much impossiblwe
<Jason> all better!
<Jason> Charles: take out your disk drive
<Lambda> is this going to play scary loud music at me?
<Charles> I did
<prince-dari> ...It's a GIF, what do you think? No. :P
<Neon> Or worse, Lady Gaga?
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130540949664.jpg
<Lambda> lololol
<prince-dari> Ages 3+ - but only bronies buying it.
<Jason> oh
<Jason> hmm
*Lambda quickly goes to another tab because his dad was behind him
<Neon> Bronidom has lost its charm in my eyes.
<prince-dari> LOOOOOOOOOOOL
<Jason> take out your current drive, and boot from damnsmalllinux
<Charles> ?
<prince-dari> Neon: It was never about the community, it was about the ponies. :P
<Ray> 02Thx Quan :3 [/late]
<Charles> how will that help me? I will be screwed when I go to turn off my computer
<Charles> on*
<Jason> plug your dick drive back in
<Jason> and burn damnsmalllinux on there
<Jason> a disk, and put it on there*
<Charles> is that even safe to insert it while the netbook is powered on?
<Jason> cant you turn it off and back on?
<Charles> I can, but the Ubuntu partition I reformatted without thinking, meaning the grub loader is all jacked up to the point of being non-Existent, meaning it will not let me boot to anything, even my livedisk USB drive will not work
<Charles> so I need to completely wipe and reformat the HDD
<Jason> Cant you still boot from acd?
<Jason> a cd*
<Charles> netbook
<Charles> no disc drive
<Jason> do you have a USB one?
<Charles> I HAD the ability to boot from USB till I killed the grub loader
<prince-dari> ...WTH
<prince-dari> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130541238329.jpg
<Charles> no
<Charles> but I imagine I would face the same issue
<Neon> It shouldn't be about either. xD
<Jason> Hmm
<Stormy> Dari, what the heck is that?
<Stormy> O_o
<prince-dari> Looks like a Hello Kitty vibrator to me.
<Lambda> that is a flashlight I think
<Lambda> that or the kitty spins around or something
<Neon> I don't think so, Lam.
<Lambda> no?
<Neon> Where would the light come from?
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Neon> It spins around all right... it's part of the vibration. xd
<Lambda> maybe the kitty glows
<Jason> And you are on ubuntu rught now?
<Lambda> or there's an led at the other end, I dunno
*Aristeo just showered :3
<Neon> Could be.
<Neon> It's dark in there, you know.
<Jason> Charles: You on ubuntu right now?
<prince-dari> Apparently "this thing is for oral use".
<Jason> Aristeo: hehe
<Stormy> O_o
<Aristeo> I'm on Kubuntu :3
<Neon> Of... course...?
<Espeon> 06Kosoveon what
<Stormy> what I want to know is why anyone would be posting that in the first place
<Jason> Im on lubuntu
<Stormy> Actually no
<Lambda> ha
<Neon> It's a plastic-flavored lollipop.
<Stormy> What I /don't/ want to know
<Stormy> >_>
<prince-dari> Someone said they got a MLP flashlight.
<Charles> no, I am on Windows. Ubuntu shall not touch my rig
<prince-dari> So someone said they got an MLP fleshlight.
<prince-dari> Then someone posted that.
<Jason> no, I mean what is the computer booted into?
<Stormy> ew
<Charles> ...
<Charles> pay attention
<Stormy> /definitely not going to ponychan anymore
<prince-dari> Lawl, the music owned your computer.
<Stormy> Yeah =.
<Stormy> *=/
<Charles> GRUB loader= dead. Grub loader is what allowed me to boot into anything once I slapped a second OS on there.
<Neon> This is why Dari's rep is far too smeared to run in this race we're having/
<Jason> ok, but right now the comp is on or off?
<Lambda> haha
<Neon> He'd have about as much of a shot as Ron Paul.
<Jason> and what is it booted into if its on
<Lambda> that and he's british
<prince-dari> The_People can't handle me.
<Charles> IT BOOTS INTO NOTHING YOU INCOMPETENT OAF!
<Lambda> this is an American election!
<Lambda> because America owns teh internets!
<Neon> Well, overlooking exclusionary reasons.
<Lambda> *English
<junh1024-XD> so arti, does dis mean that the forum will link back to this chat or ?
<Charles> without the grub loader, i cannot select my Windows OS partition, and therefore I cannot boot into anything, just an error message and a command line prompt
<Neon> At least we don't have many limits on it, unless you count Internet Killswitch.
<Neon> And a healthy dose of CP, courtesy of 4chan.
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Quanyails> 7Oh, wait:
<Quanyails> 7Articuno?
<Jason> Ok, so I dont get why you cant boot from a USB stick?
<Charles> I dont get why either. All it does is give me one line of text, which ends in copyright info
<Jason> take out the bios battery, and put it back on
<Jason> in*
<Charles> ...
<prince-dari> I love that "WOAH-OH-OH-AH-AH-AH-AH-HA-AH-AH" thing.
<Charles> I DOUBT I can access that without opening up my entire netbook(laptop for the web, btw)
*Stormy doesn't
<prince-dari> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/test/src/130530621880.swf
*prince-dari kills Stormy's computer. :P
<Jason> I know what a netbook is
<Neon> You compslayer.
*prince-dari scratches another notch into his keyboard.
<Neon> Dari, did you like my combination of it with Nyan Cat?
<Articuno> 12hmmm?
<prince-dari> Yeah, that was awesome. XD
<Articuno> 12and the site already does link back to the chat.

<Charles> christ, I know nothing of reformatting a partition(it reads as unallocated
<Quanyails> 7But in other news, I've talked with Haii. She seems to be listening to me.
<Articuno> 12Good!
<Articuno> 12Does she know it's a temp ban...?
<Quanyails> 7I don't think so.
<Quanyails> 7She originally said she wanted to ban the admin who did this to her. XD
<Charles> umm, how do I delete the unallocated partition?
<prince-dari> "Spike, Spike, come to bed". Lawl. The lines are funnier taken out of context.
<NightSeas> 12lol
<Charles> gon burn that bridge when I come to it

<prince-dari> Wow, sounds loud.
<Charles> I hope it got it right
<Neon> Well, multiple train horns.
<prince-dari> Is that even legal?
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Sheena
<SheenaFox> hi HML

<Stormy> Hey dari
<prince-dari> Yeah?
<Quanyails> 7BBL.
<Stormy> I clicked on your computer-killing link
<Stormy> and it didn't kill my computer
<Lambda> D:
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> :D
<prince-dari> Well it was just the song.
<Lambda> Lol
<prince-dari> And you said that killed your computer last time. :P
<Neon> It must've developed a tolerance...
<Stormy> Actually I think the bluescreen happened because I was trying to muffle the sound under a pillow and it overheated
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> XD
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Neon> LOL
<prince-dari> Fail.
<Lambda> and it IS a netbook :P
<Stormy> yep
<Neon> Why would you even resort to that?
<Stormy> because it was really loud and I couldn't get the volume control to work
<Stormy> so while I waited for the volume control to come up I was trying to make it shut up
<Neon> Forced shutdown would have made you lose something?
<Lambda> nah, she just didn't think loud music was worth a forced shut down I'm sure :P
<Neon> Haha, but it was worth smothering with a pillow?
<Stormy> I only did it for a few seconds at a time and hoped it wouldn't overheat
*Stormy dies her hair blonde
<Lambda> no Stormy, you're not blond
<Cat> um. an unallocated partion can't be deleted
<Lambda> just spnding to much time with a pollock such as myself maybe
<Lambda> :P
<Neon> Homophones, lol.
<prince-dari> Yeah she is, isn't is dye? :P
<Cat> it's just that: space that hasn't been allocated to a partition
<Neon> dingdingding.
<Lambda> seriously though I probably wouldn't even have thought of the computer overheating
<Stormy> I was afraid it might but figured it wouldn't if I didn't do it for too long <.<
<prince-dari> Computer overheats I R KNOW PUT IN WASSER TO CALL IT DOWN
<Neon> That is pretty weird. But you said it was a netbook, and those thing swill heat up at the drop of a hat in my experience.
<Lambda> yes
<Neon> *things will
<Lambda> dip it into a bucket of wasser
<Lambda> :D
<Neon> WASSER IZ ONLY QURE
<Stormy> I'm not that stupid, dari
<Stormy> XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Is there anyone here who would be willing to part with a Reshiram that they might happen to have?
<Lambda> my sister tried drowning our cat when we were little
<Neon> Stupid? That sounds like legiimate advice.
<prince-dari> Maybe StormBlond is.
<Neon> *legitimate
<Stormy> lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've been wanting one for a while now, but since I have White it's pretty much impossible for me to get one on my own |D
<Stormy> my stupid doppelganger has a name!
<Lambda> she dunked it into a plastic golf bag (headfirst) and held it there
<prince-dari> I like your new word Neon.
<prince-dari> Using that instead of legitimate in future. XD Awesome.
<Lambda> plasmatic, that is all
<Neon> It looks like it's a Latin cognate, so roll with it if you like.
<Stormy> how do you pronouce that? legi-i-ment?
<Neon> Lay-gee-mit.
<Stormy> *mate
<prince-dari> I was about to comment on the -ment. :P
<Lambda> I imagine it kinda like that Stormy
<Lambda> legi'imet
<Charles> kinda figured that
<Lambda> like when people say ma'am
<Lambda> instead of madam
<Charles> gonna have to extend my current partition into it though, that unallocated space will drive me nuts
<Neon> That's for a different reason, but if it helps you sound it out, that works.
<SilverSonic> XD
<prince-dari> LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL

<Skylands> 10There may be an event for Zekrom/Reshiram in the future
<Skylands> 10Since in Japan, they're having downloads of them in movie 14th's premiere
<Neon> XDDDDD
<Lambda> What the heck
<Stormy> what is the context for that?
<Lambda> Brock finally got sick of Ash dragging him everywhere
<Stormy> it has to make more sense with context
<Stormy> I mean really
<Lambda> I have a comic that makes it make sense
<prince-dari> Nope, Brock rapes Ash in the actual episode. :P
<Lambda> oh, I thought he threw him into the air
<Lambda> the camera panned up and all
<Neon> Dari's right. In the uncut Japanese version he just rapes Ash.
<Lambda> O.o
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yeah I originally told myself I'd wait for an event or for a 3rd game (Assuming both legendaries can be caught should a 3rd game be released) but a small part of me has started to become a bit impatient xD
<Lambda> I don't believe you
<prince-dari> Inflatable boobs James still gets me. So funny.
<Stormy> Neon, I can't tell if you're trolling or not
<Neon> They don't speak of it again on their journey for obvious reasons.
<Stormy> @_@
<Neon> Pikachu saw, though, and is slowly consumed by survivor's guilt.
<Lambda> ah yeah, he's trolling
<Neon> How am I trolling?
<Neon> The Pikachu part was a joke, but the rest...
<Lambda> what episode was that?
<Lambda> I'm bulbapedia'ing it
<Neon> I'm not sure. I'll look as well.
<Stormy> How the heck did that make it here when an episode with Jynx was banned because of "racial stereotypes"?
<prince-dari> I can't remember, you need to look up the Japanese name.
<Lambda> "Brock is considered the most mature, wise and level-headed of the main characters, and he is arguably the most intelligent character as well."
<Lambda> NO HE'S NOT
<Lambda> if this is true
<Neon> Well, they're all basically morons.
<Neon> So I guess in a relative light he is.
<prince-dari> /notice Neon They must be trolling - they can't beleive this at all... XD
<Neon> I've fooled them with things more farfetched than this.
<prince-dari> /notice Neon You serious? Wow.
<Neon> I'm very good at rhetoric. Plus, they're more prone to believe it psychologically if we both say the same story.
<Lambda> this is the name of a quiz I stumbled accross
<Lambda> "Can you name the Brock's Pokemon?"
<Lambda> the Brock
<prince-dari> Have you never wondered how he got his name?
<Lambda> no, I have not
<Lambda> none of the characters have normal names but Jesse and James
<Neon> Ash is fairly normal, if it's short for Asher.
<Neon> Misty sounds like a stripper name, but nonetheless normal.
<prince-dari> Misty May!
<Lambda> What's not normal about Brock in comparison?
<Lambda> I feel like I've known a Brock before
<prince-dari> I think that was one of the American Olympic volleyball people. No joke. :P
<Neon> Well, Brock Lesner is a UFC fighter.
<Neon> And a douchebag.

<Lambda> that one I remember
<prince-dari> Lol, Misty is a man.
<prince-dari> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxeajNHLTz8&feature=related
<Neon> It's so funny that people analyze these episodes.
<Stormy> that's what fandoms do
<Neon> I know, I know. That's probably why they're so entertaining to watch.
<Stormy> if you think that's bad you should see the MLP fanbase, where apparently two female ponies are married and have a daughter together because they were standing next to each other in one episode
<Stormy> :P
<prince-dari> LOL
<Neon> Hahahahaha.
<Lambda> XDDD seriously?
<Stormy> yes
<Stormy> completely serious

<prince-dari> Nope, what's this?
<Neon> He says that according to "calculations" he did it had to be in the range of April 7th to May 21st, but of course he picks the very end of the range to have the most time possible. xD
<prince-dari> Lol - calculations.
<Neon> I know. It would all have to based on assumption, seeing as he would have to determine the exact year the Earth was finishe forming, which he claims to know.
<Neon> That and if he is a Christian he did a pretty good job of ignoring the book of Matthew, which explicitly states that no man can know "the day or the hour."

<prince-dari> Is that from Anchorman? I haven't seen it, my friends say it's funny, but it sounds stupid.

<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> On a plus side I finally mastered every combat skill on Mabi
<Chimera> 04meow
<Quilava> wow. gratz
<Jason> awwweee
<Jason> <3
<Isukra> 12meow Chimera :D
<Isukra> 12oh wait
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Total level is now over 1500 XD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I wanna solo peace >:(
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Peaca*
<Quilava> <.>
<Umbreon> 12solo peaca hard mode when it comes out
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> You can't solo Peaca
<Umbreon> 12sure you can
<Umbreon> 12you enter with people then everyone leaves
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> You HAVE to be in a party of 4+ to even enter it
<Umbreon> 12just ask 3 people to join with you then leave when they enter
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Hard Mode Rundal is bad enough
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Already tried that
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Everyone wants to do Peaca
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Especially with a pro -.-
<Umbreon> 12find some noobs then that won't even leave a dent
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Done that
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> None of them quit
<Umbreon> 12who cares if they quit they are so bad it's like they don't even exist there lol
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I want the EXP/Rewards to myself
<Dialga> 3 alts
<Umbreon> 12your total level is 1500, share some glory
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Umbreon, Peaca is the hardest dungeon, even at my total I will more than likely die alot
<Umbreon> 12i know
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> and Dialga, you CAN'T use Alt's on Mabi, unless you have more than 1 comp
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> In my case I have 1 comp
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Well 2
<Dialga> acquire 3 more computers
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> -.-
<Aristeo> KITTEN!
<Aristeo> :D
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Solo'ing Hard Mode Alby Intermediate is no longer fun
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Trying to get a Alby Adv pass
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Bloody things are hard to come by :|
<Lambda> only one exlamation point eh
<Lambda> *exclamation
<Jason> hehe
<Aristeo> i be sleepy
<Stormy> shameful
<Jason> there was like 8 when he said my nick
<Jason> <3
<Lambda> :P
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Ciar Advanced Hard Mode solo is fun
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> XD
<Stormy> I only get one, and not even all caps
<Stormy> Aristeo doesn't love me
<Stormy> </3
*Aristeo loves Stormy! D:
<Lambda> I don't even get a greeting :<
*Aristeo loves Jason and Stormy and Kitten and Lambda D:
<Lambda> then again I think Aristeo was still asleep when I got here
<Jason> Notce how I was first :
<Umbreon> 12i did an intermediate once
<Umbreon> 12that was enough
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Alby Advance is a pain in normal modes
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Hard Mode of it though
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Hmm
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Not sure, not tried it yet
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Not had the pass
<Kitten> Jason got 8?
<Umbreon> 12i just have no talent for the game
<Jason> yesh
<Jason> well, a lot more than one
*Kitten pouts and curls up with Lambda
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Well having R1 on all Combat skills
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> and Beast Lord to boot
<Lambda> that spot's taken by Stormy, sorry
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I can one shot every enemy in Ciar Adv (Including the boss)
<Stormy> hehe
<Kitten> well then thats fine by me too
*Kitten nuzzles into Stormy then giggles and runs off
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> One shotting Ogre Warriors is fun too
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Though one thing that is making my laugh so hard right now
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> My brother is playing Mabi (total level isn't even 150 yet)
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> And he thinks he could beat me in a PVP
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I'm wearing full Colin Plate Armour with a Lava Cat Robe
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> HP is 462, MP is 231, Stam is 631
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> And I have Beast Lord
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Hmmmmmmm

<Light_Latias> laa
<Jason> my comp just got constipated there
<Jason> it just shut down
<Jason> and I was like wtfff
<Jason> Aristeo: I found out how to fix the problem :D
<Isukra> 12Light_Latias is happy ;D

<Aristeo> and where <3
<prince-dari> Oh, Stormy and Lambda both got auto-ignored.

<Lambda> whenever he says that
<Lambda> which is essentially dari ignoring himself
<Lambda> that is all, I just got a little overexcited :P
<Jason> Aristeo: What did you do to get the apache2 directory back?
<Aristeo> sudo apt-get purge apache* && sudo apt-get install apache
<Charles> I killed the spare comp :(
<Charles> I think
<Jason> Aristeo: THanks :D
<Charles> I know I screwed something up quite badly when I reinserted the RAM
<Jason> Charles: hmm :(
<Jason> Charles: When sparks start flying out, you know you did SOMETHING wrong
<Charles> meh, no worries though, twas an old Athlon I Emachines
<Charles> just sucks that I have to now Build a new comp for my gf, rather than fix the old one up and give it to her
<Jason> meh
<Jason> I guess
<Jason> just get a cheap one off ebay
<Charles> but I got this one for free, and it was borderline suitable
<Charles> just needed more RAM and a dedicated GPU
<Jason> I gues
*Jason hugs Charles
<Jason> mmm squishy
*Charles hugs back
<Charles> hey!
<Light_Latias> orly
<Jason> :)
<Isukra> 12hi
<Charles> I am trying to get into shape
<Jason> xD
<Light_Latias> <late>
<Charles> hmm, is 2 gigs enough for a person who really just expects to play Sims 3 on her desktop, and little of anything more taxing?
<Light_Latias> hai
<Isukra> 12how goes
<Jason> nope
<Charles> ?
<Jason> sims 2 will like rape the hell out of those 2gb
<Jason> you will need more, for that game alone
<Jason> plus to have windows on it?
<Charles> damn
<Jason> If you put xp on there, maybe 2.5 will be fine
<Jason> windows 7? at least 3.5/4
<Charles> k
<Charles> does not matter what speed though, right?
<Light_Latias> semi-decent
<Light_Latias> yous?
<Isukra> 12feathery x-x
<Charles> Hmm, I know little about integrated graphics
<Jason> back
<Jason> hmm
<Cat> The Sims 3 would do fine with 3GB of ram on windows 7
<Cat> but it likely won't play nice with integrated graphics unless like, all the settings are at minimum
<Jason> Cat: think of all the background processes
<Charles> if I am going over 2 gigs, it is generally cheaper to get the full 4
<Cat> yeah, go for 4
<Jason> yeah, go for that
<Charles> background processes should be minimal, will be a clean install
<Cat> is it 32-bit or 64-bit windows?
<Jason> 32bit
<Jason> definitely
<Cat> why?
<Charles> well, if I am building it, will def be 64 bit
<Jason> why?
<Cat> 64-bit is more futureproof?
<Jason> obvious compatability
<Jason> issues*
<Cat> it means you can use more than 3.5GB of ram
<Jason> bah
<Cat> I've been using 64-bit operating systems for nearly 3 years now
<Jason> I guess.
<Charles> I have yet to encounter any compatibility issues
<Cat> and I generally don't come up with compatibility issues
<Isukra> 12wb ecco
<Charles> and any 32 bit programs seem to get their own folder
<Jason> meh, thats why there is compatability mode
<Ascendant> o_O
<Jason> yeah, they do
<Cat> and the one I did come up against was with unsupported starforce DRM drivers for an old game
<Cat> 64-bit can still run 32-bit programs
<Jason> C;\programfiles(86)
<EccoCode> thank you Umbreon.
<Cat> I cannot think of a single reason to not get a 64-bit these days
<Charles> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138294
<Charles> this might work
<Isukra> 12yay i'm umbreon :)
<Charles> not futureproof though
*Isukra doesn't poof into a dolphin
<Cat> other than perhaps if you have an ancient cpu that doesn't support 64-bit
<EccoCode> And I think my internet may crash on me again
<Cat> but if that's the case, why are you buying a new OS rather than a new CPU
<Isukra> 12D:
<Jason> http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138294
<Jason> xD
<Cat> that is a pretty cheap motherboard
<Jason> look at the price difference between us and canada
<Cat> does it only have 2 ram slots? D:
<Cat> I have never bought a micro-ATX motherboard
<Jason> Cat: I have 8000000000000000000000000000 ram slots
<Cat> shut up
<Cat> I have a normal ATX motherboard at the moment
<Cat> next one would be nice if it was extended-ATX, preferably with SLI support
<Jason> I have a motherboard that I got with my comp
<Jason> its fine for now.,
<Cat> you probably have 4 ram slots
<Cat> that's the most common amount
<Jason> I have 2
<Charles> Micro-ATX is a good board, but most certainly is hell to work with when you get it in a micro-ATX case
<Cat> what cpu are you using?
<Kosoveon> hi ecco
<Kosoveon> and that sucks :(
<Cat> I upgraded the pc at home to have a 2.9GHz Athlon II X2
<Armageddon> ;o
<EccoCode> hey Kosovo, and, I think it is okay. But we'll see.
*Armageddon stabs Altair
<Cat> and for the graphics card I used an Nvidia GT240
<Cat> basically all my old parts :P
<Charles> Cat: who was your question directed at?
<Ray> 02Ohai NS
<Cat> you're the one building the PC arent' you charles?
<MtChar|Sleep> k
<Ray> 02also, FUUUU-- Cliff Racer ;__;
<MtChar|Sleep> if thats how it is now
<Charles> true
<Jason> I have a 2.8ghz dual core intel
<Cat> that's not too bad
<Jason> I am upgrading to an intel p4
<Jason> 3.6ghz
<Charles> anyways, prolly any one of the AM3 CPU's
<Cat> upgrading to a P4?
<Jason> yeah
<Cat> that is a really stupid idea
<Jason> why?
<Cat> P4s are ancient
<Jason> yeah
<Jason> I have a Pentium D atm
<Jason> xD
<Armageddon> heya
<Jason> p4 is the most my cpu will support
<Cat> get a new motherboard, then?
<Jason> I dont have money
<Charles> Jason, chances are you are using 7-10 year old tech
<Ray> 02I got killed by at least a swarm of 7 of those
<Cat> and yet you're upgrading the cpu?
<Jason> and Im getting a new computer in september anyways
<Cat> well don't waste your money upgrading this one then
<Charles> shell out the 385 needed to build a foot in the door system and call it a day
<MtChar|Sleep> hi
<Jason> Charles: IBM thinkcenter, its like 6 yrs old
<Jason> Cat: I need just this upgrade.. my comp barely runs with the processor I have now
<Charles> the PC itself might be 6 years old, but the tech inside is likely 7-10
<Jason> And I dont have money
<Jason> Well, I do
<Jason> but I am saving up for a dedi
<Jason> offshore
<Cat> why?
<Jason> I cant get a job here, legally
<Jason> till next year
<Jason> so :(
<Armageddon> ._.
<Armageddon> ohai MtChar|Sleep
<MtChar|Sleep> nope
<Cat> too young?
<MtChar|Sleep> im sleeping
<Jason> yepp
<Cat> can't you even do a paper round or something?
<Jason> yeah
<Umbreon> 12Armageddon
<Jason> but that pays like 4 times less than minimum wage
<Umbreon> 12how do i DC the jumper on TST?
<Jason> its like $10/day
<Jason> and I have to work for like 2 hours
<Jason> minimum wage here is $10.50/hr
<Cat> 5 dollars an hour doesn't so bad
<Cat> and it's not like you're paying bills
<Jason> I need to be
<Cat> I worked for a year at minimum wage
<Stormy> $10.50 an hour is minimum wage?
<Cat> it was hell
<Umbreon> 12jkkjjjkjkjjkjjjjjjjjkkkjkkjjkjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjk
<Jason> Stormy: yes.
<Stormy> It's only $7.25 here
<Umbreon> 12whoops
<Jason> Cat: meh, I guess.
<Stormy> That seems like a lot to me
<Lambda> 10.50?!
<Lambda> Holy crap
<Jason> Yeah
<Cat> it was £5.80 when I was working
<Stormy> I know right?
<Jason> its gonna go up to $12.50 soon
<Lambda> I just got a RAISE for 8.50
<Jason> Lambda: xD
<where> It's like $14 here
<Stormy> oh wait, canadian dollars, right?
<Lambda> ohhhhh
<Stormy> that would explain it
<Stormy> XD
<where> Assuming you're 18
<Jason> Stormy: CAD is worth more than USD now, atm
<Proto> <Takanuva> Proto: 10.00 cad = 10.33 usd

<Cat> o.O
<Quilava> oh wow.. v0.30
<Jason> :OOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Quilava> that's.. absurdly old
<Cat> oh right, is it for online gaming?
<Charles> I would not imagine so, unless a lot of applications would be run on it
*Jason stabs and buries Cat
*Jason has a lot of applications runnign
<Jason> plus, it has a quad core
<Charles> if all it were handling was just some content and a lot of traffic, then the CPU and HDD speeds would be more important
<Jason> processor
<Jason> and I need the HDD space
<Jason> 3TB
<Jason> :D
<Cat> for $70 a month, you could have a decent HDD and a quad core in your own pc
<Cat> o.O
<Charles> yeah
<MtChar|Sleep> my classic server is better
<MtChar|Sleep> look up Icy Pond
<Jason> Cat: My mobo doesnt support that
<Cat> motherboards are cheap?
<Quilava> classic is boring too
<MtChar|Sleep> meh
<MtChar|Sleep> no creepers
<Cat> I got mine, a really quite decent one with support for loads of stuff, for about £60
<Quilava> I was hoping SDK would update his mod
<MtChar|Sleep> even though i own the game
<Cat> not micro ATX or anything
<Charles> 70 a month is $840 dollars. for that you could build one high end gaming machine, or 1 mid range high traffic high capacity server
<Jason> meh
<Jason> but I dont have a 100mbit connection

<Ascendant> because I haven't used ctcp scripts for ages

<Umbreon> 12it's the same exact code as the other ownership
<SilverSonic> hmm
<Umbreon> 12Armageddon any idea? lol
<Armageddon> what?
<Armageddon> uh
<Armageddon> you could have 2 of the same scripts
<Armageddon> which you do
<Umbreon> 12then how come when you do a /ctcp say for isukra it doesn't double line as well?
<Isukra> 12can you double check for me please SilverSonic
<Armageddon> you need to change the variables
<Umbreon> 12i did
<Armageddon> and well
<Armageddon> you should only have one script
<Armageddon> so it's like
<Umbreon> 12ctcp *:say:*: if ($nick == %kranick) /msg $$2 $$3- ( $+ $nick $+ )
<Umbreon> 12vs
<Umbreon> 12ctcp *:say:*: if ($nick == %espynick) /msg $$2 $$3- ( $+ $nick $+ )
<Armageddon> that should work
<Umbreon> 12you saw the resuls
<Umbreon> 12*results
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(WhiteTail02)03WB* - <Zoroark> 12So what? It's ok to bend the rules at times

*eXAKR now belongs to Isukra for 9 minutes
<nickstr> and plus its not exactly a good idea to format a removable media card as NTFS
<nickstr> because many devices only work with FAT32
<nickstr> if you will only be using it with a computer and no other portable devices then its ok
<lightumbreon> just formatted to FAT32, it works fine now
<nickstr> it will but I just recommend keeping that as FAT32 just to be safe

<Novi> best part is when
<Novi> Black whirlwind
<Novi> normal sicc
<Novi> add bora
<Armageddon> who had like 3 boras, gale and another blackwing on the field
<Armageddon> :x
<Novi> speical 3 boras
<Novi> gale
<Armageddon> LOL black whirlwind
<Armageddon> :x
<Armageddon> card is overpowered I swear
<Novi> so you have
<Armageddon> I still think Silverwind is the best
<Novi> so you technically have then
<Novi> 8400 piercing
<Novi> on field
<Novi> enough for game :(
<Armageddon> pretty much
<Armageddon> or you could use sircc's effect
<Armageddon> then icarus attack
<Armageddon> and then fuck your opponent with that
<Novi> but this would be first turn if you draw into giant trunade~
<Armageddon> I never use that card
<Armageddon> :x
<Armageddon> also
<Armageddon> Thought Ruler Archfiend <3
<Armageddon> favourite character is still Sayer
<Armageddon> :x
<Novi> :P
<Novi> have to admit my frav card is stardust
<Novi> but frav deck has always been without fail with blackwings
<Armageddon> heh
<Armageddon> oh yeah
<Armageddon> my other fav is rex goodwin :x
<Novi> omg>.>
<Novi> :p

<Aurelian> Guess I can just bookmark that link then
<Cat> which link?
<Cat> :O
<Aurelian> The link to the irc chat?
<Cat> ah, okay
<Aurelian> Nothing exciting, I'm afraid
<Cat> I'm really hungry D:
<Cat> not sure whether to make something now, or to wait until the chippy opens and go there
<Aurelian> Fish and chips?
<Cat> yes
<Cat> I am going to prepare noodles for now
<Cat> I will still get zeh chips laters
<Aurelian> Where do you live, UK?
<Cat> yes
<Cat> near Birmingham
<Aurelian> What do you use for condiment there? Malt vinegar?
<Aurelian> Everything here is tartar sauce and cole slaw. : /
<Aurelian> Southerners put cole slaw on everything. I swear
<Cat> salt and vinegar are common
<Cat> also, curry sauce, gravy, mushy peas or baked beans
<Cat> coleslaw is usually more a fried chicken thing here
<Aurelian> My grandfather loves crab cakes with beans. Don't think I've ever seen curry sauce though
<Aurelian> I'm hungry now, going to have fried eggs and kielbasa
<Cat> have fun
<Cat> kielbasa is sausage, right?
<Aurelian> Yeah

<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> You can download a real client...?
<Ascendant> like mIRC or X-chat
<Ascendant> I believe drf has a pre-configured mIRC for use
<Darkdragon> ... And I am going to try that. Maybe.
<Ascendant> don't know where it went :x

<Articuno> 12I think I did a long time ago but forgot how
<Darkdragon> WHICH IS ILLEGAL
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Articuno> 12If you look at my profile in the Shadow Lugia theme, it's the dark ppurple bit :/
<Articuno> 12lol
<Ascendant> it's windowbg1 or windowbg2
<Ascendant> can't remember
*Ascendant checks
<Articuno> 12Really? I have that set I thought
<Articuno> 12I thought those were the middle bits
<Darkdragon> RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANTING
<Ascendant> oh wait
<Ascendant> it is
<Angel_Espeon> 13there's a topic with Help and Feedback section with the code, isn't there?

<Ascendant> are you saying I'm not silly?
<Ascendant> I'm offended, idiot.
<lightumbreon|LightLugia> here we go again....

<Pattyrick> That's what I am.
<Articuno> 12Your profile has lots of stuff on it..

<lightumbreon|LightLugia> look who's here!
<Pattyrick> I mean, hi. =D
<Darkdragon> THEN WE SHALL HAVE A BATTLE OF THE AGES ASCENDANT
<Pattyrick> Hi Arti.
<Ascendant> hm
<Darkdragon> Oh, hi, pat
<Articuno> 12tborder didnt fix it :(
<Pattyrick> Hi Dark Dragon.
<lightumbreon|LightLugia> if it isn't our Orange loving italian Pat
<Articuno> 12It's still purple on the Shadow Lugia theme,
<Pattyrick> HEY! I'm still American! xD
<Ascendant> Hm
<lightumbreon|LightLugia> xD
<Articuno> 12I'd like it to be either white or transparent or something
<Ray> 02... In America
*Pattyrick thinks that perhaps that's not a good thing...
<Ascendant> is it titlebg, Articuno?
<Ray> 02[/reference]
<Ascendant> and it's white on the Articuno/Lugia theme
<Articuno> 12I have titlebg set
<Darkdragon> I am an honorable dude, Ascendant. I shall let you choose your type of battle.
<Articuno> 12If anyone visits my profile using the SL theme it is purple and rubbish
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> try table { transparent; }
<Pattyrick> I can't wait until the DOL theme comes to the forum.
<Articuno> 12Sorry just testing something
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> table { background-color: transparent; }
<Darkdragon> DOL?
<Ascendant> /fail
<Ascendant> and heya rye
<Ascendant> DOL?
<Pattyrick> Deep Ocean Lugia
<Ascendant> oh lol
<Articuno> 12I already have

<Articuno> 12Lol ^^;
<Ascendant> ah
<Darkdragon> Oh, cool.
<Ascendant> newsbar?
<Pattyrick> Really! =D Let me check it out.
<Articuno> 12I could try newsbar I ghuess
<Pattyrick> That's what the maintenance was for yesterday.
<Ascendant> don't think it'd be newsbar though
<Ascendant> or menubar
<Darkdragon> So, now what?
*Articuno isn't sure what Pattyrick is talking about
<Ascendant> I think he's talking about a new theme :x
<Ascendant> that you may or may not make in the future
<Ascendant> :x
<Pattyrick> Wait, it's not on the forum yet.
<Articuno> 12I think he's confused..
<Articuno> 12Ovo
<Ascendant> or try table.newsbar { if newsbar doesn't work
<Ascendant> yeah :x
<Articuno> 12Who told you I made a DOL theme for the forum?
<Pattyrick> The Deep Ocean Lugia theme is on the main site, but not on the forum.
<Pattyrick> Who made it then?
<Ascendant> <Pattyrick> I can't wait until the DOL theme comes to the forum.
<Articuno> 12No one did
<Darkdragon> Eh, we could use a new theme. Or better yet, make the Ho-oh temple theme actually work on the forum. It's pretty awesome.
*Pattyrick is also confused.
<Ascendant> I'm confused now
<Articuno> 12Who said anyone made the theme? ovO
<Ascendant> o_O
<Darkdragon> 0-o
<Articuno> 12D:
<Darkdragon> So... #waffles
<Pattyrick> Likes waffles.
*Pattyrick likes pancakes even more, though.
<Ascendant> but yeah, Articuno, does table.newsbar/newsbar work?
<Darkdragon> That was experimental. I guess.
<Darkdragon> Man, how do you do that?
<Pattyrick> So was Fermi's nuclear reactor.
<Articuno> 12Haven't tried yet, I found Ripred's topic and am just looking at that quickly
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> I haven't done the CSS for ages :x
<Ascendant> just did it and then left it
<Articuno> 12I did it ^^
<Darkdragon> I feel very silly/hyper right now.

<Articuno> 12hehehehe ^^
<Ascendant> does anyone actually believe
<Articuno> 12Haii's topic was so funny
<Ascendant> that Haii is 13?
<Ascendant> yeah it was
<Articuno> 12Maybe ^^;
<Articuno> 12It's a possibility
<Ascendant> personally I think she's 11
<Ascendant> even I didn't act like that
<Darkdragon> Haii... She's a special case. She refuses to obey the rules outside of the RP boards, and I do try to help her. I do. BUT SHE'S INSANE BLARRGH
<Ascendant> and I was bad enough
<Ascendant> she's not insane
<Ascendant> have you ever seen any of my ooooooold posts?
<Ascendant> as Nightshadow
<Ascendant> I'm sure Articuno remembers
<Ascendant> and not to mention my posts in the spam topic :x

<Jason> Dear New Running Partner,
<Jason> Hello! My name is Mustafi Chukwuemeka Adetokunbo, but my friends call me Wuemeka. I have just moved to Philadelphia from Kenya and I too am looking for a running partner. I run for twelve miles every morning, and another eight at night. I now run a 4 minute mile. I know this is slow, but no worry, I am aiming to run a 3:50 mile by next month. I most look forward to running with you, my new friend! Please respond with your contact information a
<Jason> nd where you would like to run. I am not so acquainted with Philadelphia, but I would prefer to run in densely forested areas if you know of any.
<Jason> Oh, so in your drunken stupor you decided it would be a good idea to wake up my entire family at 3:30 in the morning? I have my computer hooked up to a 7.1 surround sound system, and Outlook plays a sound every time I receive an e-mail. It damn near rattled the house when you sent it. You woke up our three month old baby and now he is crying.
<Jason> I have a meeting with some big-time clients today, and now I am going to be falling asleep in the meeting. Thanks a lot, douchebag.
<Jason> I don't like your attitude, pal. First you wake up my entire family, and now you curse me out? This is unacceptable. By the way, my wife was so distraught from you waking her up that she accidentally microwaved our baby's milk too long. The baby was scalded with burning hot milk, and now we have to go to the hospital. I hope you are happy with yourself. Is this how you normally sell iPhones on the internet?
<Jason> Aristeo:
<mib> Mib ^.^
<Jason> Cat: I have access to about twenty black widow spiders, and about 50 brown recluse spiders. For $200, I can release them at your party, and everyone can enjoy them. They are great for kids! I know a lot about insects from my job. I worked in an office on the first floor that had cheap windows, so I always had to kill bugs. I can tell you how to kill anything from a stink bug to an African burrowing scorpion. I can give a small speech to your p
<Jason> arty about this.
<Aristeo> Wow you could've just linked that

<Jason> and it no longer works
<Jason> so I found the 20GB hdd
<Charles> lol, I don't know why you don't use that desktop for yourself
<Jason> because I have a better one
<nickstr> Pokemon Puzzle League was released in Germany apparently
<Jason> If you dont want it, maybe I will use it
<Jason> is there a thing so you can make your screen switch from one comp to another?
<Nickario> I forgot about that game
<Charles> yes
<Charles> a KVM switcher
<nickstr> not me
<nickstr> because when it comes to many aspects of Pokemon I am stuck in the past
<Jason> :OO
<Jason> How much is one of those?
<Charles> not quite sure how they work, but essentially it acts like my HDMI switcher and allows you to plug in multiple computers to one hub, and from there you plug in your monitor, and typically your keyboard and mouse as well, and you are able to switch to whichever comp you need to with the press of a button
<nickstr> TV show, movies, music
<Jason> hmm
<Jason> thats cool
<Jason> yeah, I know of someone who has one, just didnt know what they were called

<Nickario> xxLatiosxx try holland
<nickstr> Pokemon The First Movie, Pokemon The Movie 2000, and Pokemon 3 The Movie were widespread releases
<Aristeo> http://dontevenreply.com/top.php
*Angel_Espeon still hasn't seen the Arceus movie or Zoroark movie
<xxLatiosxx> 12It's okay, not the best Pokémon film but ehh it's watchable I guess
<Nickario> I've seen it there and its PAL, so maybe it has an english version I dunno
<xxLatiosxx> 12Oh right owo thanks for the tip =)
<nickstr> releasing a Pokemon movie in theaters now in the US would be disasterous
<Jason> I saw you said pets are ok, so I hope the two parrots I own will not be a problem. They only understand German, which I do not speak, so I kind of just let them fly around and do their own thing. Aristeo
<Angel_Espeon> 13wb Sky :3
<Skylands> 10Thanks, Espy
<Aristeo> o.o
<Damos> SKY!
<Skylands> 10Damos!
*Damos huggles
<Skylands> 10Can I PM you, Damos?
<Jason> Xd
<Jason> XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Skylands> 10I asked earlier, not sure why you haven't responded. If you don't want to, please let me know
<Hyper> Or else
<Damos> oh sorry
<Hyper> :D
<Jason> know you said female only, but my friends have told me that I am very feminine. I even like to watch American Idol! And if you don't mind me asking, why do you think I am a horrible person to live with? If you have a problem with my German parrots, I'll understand. My last roommate was Jewish too.
<nickstr> this situation is not too upsetting to me
<nickstr> although it was frustrating trying to find DVD box sets for Johto
<nickstr> because Viz squats on their licenses
<xxLatiosxx> 12If the anime was like the manga...it would be awesome ¦3
<Damos> ew
<nickstr> um no
<nickstr> it might have failed and remained obscure
<Aristeo> You need to find me a girlfriend Jason ;3
<Jason> I will
<Aristeo> kk
<nickstr> because what works in manga does not always work in anime
<nickstr> in this case it would not
<Damos> 13kids wb HML
<nickstr> the TV show was a huge hit for the first two seasons as it existed because it seemed to have something for everyone in that era
<nickstr> not to mention a main girl with a significant depth in personality
<nickstr> plus it was before Brock's skirt chasing got out of hand

<Lambda> Yep
<Stormy> This discrimination against haters of lamp must end
<Nyan> Not as long as I draw breath.
<Lambda> Let us go crusading for the hating of lamp!
<Nyan> Next thing you know you'll want equal rights for all Americans.
<Lambda> Nah, screw that
<Lambda> Equal rights for all Americans who hate lamp, sure
<Lambda> but everyone else?
<Lambda> Pfft
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> That is my campaign platform
<Nyan> You're despicable.
<Nyan> I can't believe you'll even consort with antilampists, never mind defend them.
*Ray yawns
<Isukra> 12HyperMetalLugia
<Lambda> Anti-lampists speak the word of Truth
<Lambda> I learned this in my travels
<Nyan> The only truth that can be seen is mirrored in the love for lamp.
<Nyan> You are merely deceived by a sad facsimile of truth.

<`> Jesus christ
<Armageddon> XD
<Ascendant> actionscript.
<Ascendant> mfw
<`> but
<`> hi Armageddon
<`> xD
<Ascendant> I wouldn't count AS as programming really
<Ascendant> well technically it is
<Ascendant> but it's such a b*tch that I wouldn't use it
<Armageddon> heya XD
<Mikey> so what's up
<`> how're you
<`> other than screaming your head off

<Armageddon> I'm hungry

<`> don't take candy from strangers
<`> unless they're push pops
<`> (get it)
<Chimera> 04heh
<Chimera> 04All I need for programming is just a few calculators for damage and calling to other frames when someone presses a button...
<Chimera> 04Maybe this is more complex than I thought XD
*HyperMetalLugia gives Flash a Cacti
<Armageddon> xD
<Ascendant> oh
<Ascendant> 2 Chimera
<Ascendant> isn't the calling frame thing just a goto();
<Ascendant> @Chimera*
<Chimera> 04well yeah
<Chimera> 04you
<Chimera> 04're right
<Chimera> 04but like
<Ascendant> derp
<Chimera> 04I wanted calculators for damage as well
<Ascendant> write an array
<Chimera> 04and things like, if a certain value = 0 then goto death frames
<Ascendant> like, x, y = shithere
<Ascendant> oh
<Chimera> 04that value being damage :P
<Ascendant> it uses if (stuff == 0) {
<Ascendant> or something
<Ascendant> it's like C
<Ascendant> or C++
<Ascendant> can't remember
<Ascendant> I dropped AS ages ago ;x
<Chimera> 04heh
<Spyrorocks> anyone here ever airbrush a laptop before?
<Chimera> 04I have some knowledge of C
<Charles> :/ mope. sounds fun though
<Ascendant> or something
<Ascendant> so if (yourvalue == 0) { goto(); };
<Chimera> 04should probably look up some tutorials
<Chimera> 04That might help
<Ascendant> do that
<Chimera> 04THere's probably dozens of actionscript game tutorials on Youtube |D
<Chimera> 04cultivating a crapload of them should help, lul
<EccoCode> Greetings everyone.
<Ascendant> what AS version are you using, Chimera?
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Ecco
<Ascendant> and heya EccoCode
<Chimera> 04hi Ecco
<Chimera> 04um
<Chimera> 04CS5?
<Chimera> 04would that mean version 4?
<Ascendant> ActionScript 2 or ActionScript 3?
<Chimera> 04hm
<Chimera> 04probably 3
<Ascendant> There's only 2
<Ascendant> ewwwwww
<Chimera> 04:V
<Chimera> 04well
<Ascendant> Why the flying F*CK are you using 3
<Chimera> 04I don't NEED to use it
<Ascendant> use 2
<Chimera> 04k
<Ascendant> 3 has a fckload of bugs
<Chimera> 04I wasn't even using AS yet XD
<Ascendant> has more bugs than my garden does
<Chimera> 04wanna see the current animation progress tho?
<Ascendant> I'm at school
<Chimera> 04oh
<Chimera> 04no flash...?
<Chimera> 04heh
<Spyrorocks> yeah im wondering if it would be worth doing it myself
<Ascendant> no just blocked sites
<Spyrorocks> or getting it done professionally.
<Chimera> 04how about I give you the link, you E-Mail it to yourself, and then you look at it at home |D
<Chimera> 04or I can E-Mail it to you
<Chimera> 04I mean
<Ascendant> imma lazy fck
<Chimera> 04I think "E-Mailing for work related purposes" is allowed
<Chimera> 04and lol
<Chimera> 04u lazy ;P
<Ascendant> just mail it to me
<Charles> Hmm, well, you could always get one of them Skinz things. Make your own design, upload it to there, and then have em print it out and mail it to you
<Ascendant> I'll check it after you do so
<Charles> or are you just looking for a nice solid color?
<Ascendant> admin@nightshadow.co.cc
<Ascendant> or nightshadow@ho-ohrealm.net
<Ascendant> whatever you prefer
<Ascendant> also
<Ascendant> telnetting into IRC is fun ;x
<Spyrorocks> just looking for a solid color
<Charles> well, should be easy enough to do it yourself then
<Spyrorocks> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2827825/mymba.png
<Charles> liberal use of blue painters tape and an exacto knife will work
<Spyrorocks> thats what i want it to look like eventually
<Spyrorocks> I want to be a little artistic :P
<Spyrorocks> I spraypainted an eeepc before
<Spyrorocks> lol

<Jason> Perhaps I will drink the pepssi after I finish the rum
<Chimera> 04...why is nobody here ;-;
*Ray rawrs
<Ray> 02I'm here... lurking... like a boss
<Soyuz> yes Ray?
<Ray> 02Soyuz: CLIFF RACEEERS ;____;
<Soyuz> let me guess
<Soyuz> your playing Morrowind
<Soyuz> and you are currently at level 3 or 2
<Ray> 02yep
<Ray> 022
<Soyuz> Your a poor bastard
<Soyuz> but yes
<Soyuz> cliff racers are bastards
<Soyuz> Where are you now
<Ray> 02in the mage guild, in balmore.. afraid of cliff racers ewe
<Soyuz> Gawd
<Soyuz> betchj
<Soyuz> Mage Guild?
<Soyuz> you can do better
<Soyuz> But yeah
<Ray> 02.-.
<Soyuz> heading up to that Fort, you'll get attacked by Cliff Racrs
<Soyuz> but there is no other way around it
<Soyuz> I strongly
<Soyuz> fuck
<Soyuz> I order you
<Ray> 02They were too many >-<
<Ray> 02I can kill one or two at the same time
<Soyuz> to at least gain some spells from the Temple or Mages Guild
<Ray> 02But 7
<Soyuz> that act as..
<Soyuz> what
<Ray> 027?!
<Soyuz> okay you used that meme
<Soyuz> and seriously?
<Soyuz> Seven?
<Ray> 02Yeah ;_;
<Soyuz> You either fucked up and ran back to balmora
<Soyuz> Or
<MtChar> Yay
<Soyuz> somehow they spawned alot there
<Soyuz> seven or more are usually found around the area near Ghost-Fence
<Ray> 02I tried to run, and they still raped me
<Soyuz> never in my gaming time of Morrowind did I find seven there
<Soyuz> thats because if you run they can still hit you
<Soyuz> unless your very far away from them
<Ray> 02;_;
<Soyuz> So then
<Soyuz> I suppose you went to the Imperial Fort?
<Ray> 02Yeah
<Soyuz> No way you could find that many or any Cliff Racers when- okay
<Soyuz> Go to Caldera
<Ray> 02why? o-o
<Soyuz> Because on your way there you need to find a girl (trader) whom has the blinding boots of speed
<Soyuz> get a good weapon
<Soyuz> get her to hla ode
<Soyuz> talk to her about being a bad trader
<Soyuz> kill her
<Soyuz> take the boots
<Soyuz> and it'll have a benefit
<Ray> 02Ki-- ...
<Soyuz> and a consequence
<Haseo> ZA WARUDO
<Ray> 02Inb4: rape
<Haseo> inb4 corpse babies
<Haseo> :o
<Soyuz> you can guess the consequence by its name
<Soyuz> the boots of Blinding Speed
<Ray> 02I've been raped by merchants before ;_;
<Ray> 02not fun.
<Soyuz> ..
<Soyuz> okay
<Soyuz> what weapon
<Soyuz> do you have
<Soyuz> and what race are you
<Ray> 02Dark elf (hence the mage guild ¬¬) and a iron broadsword
<Soyuz> Fuck
<Soyuz> no wonder you suck in close combat
<Griggs> BATTLE MAGE
<Soyuz> your long sword skill has to be 20 at least
<Soyuz> which sucks
<Soyuz> what armor are you wearing
*Ray has it at 35 ._.
<Griggs> Why are you using swords
<Soyuz> yeah, it still sucks
<Griggs> Equip a firestaff
<Soyuz> Firestaffs are still weapons
<Soyuz> in Morrowind, you bash them
<Ray> 02I wish I had one in the firstplace
<Soyuz> you can use the magic quality of it
<Griggs> In Oblivion, shit comes out of your wants
<Griggs> wands
<Griggs> staves
<Griggs> rofl
<Soyuz> but it can still be a melele weapons
<Soyuz> Ray; what
<Soyuz> is
<Soyuz> your
<Soyuz> armor
<Ray> 02also, why the hell does the magicka (or however it's spelled) doesn't recover when I rest?
<Soyuz> Because its not an easy game
<Soyuz> and what birth sign did you choose
<Griggs> yeah morrowind was hard as balls
<Griggs> go play oblivion dude
<Ray> 02I have been stuck in melee combat for a good while ¬¬
<Soyuz> thats what made it good
<Soyuz> fuck don't listen to Griggs
<Griggs> Oblivion was amazing
<Soyuz> Oblivion sucked hard
<Griggs> You suck hard
<Soyuz> is graphics were good
<Ray> 02Go buy me a better PC dude, @Griggs
<Griggs> Build one
<Chimera> 04grah
<Soyuz> Ray; like I asked thrice
<Soyuz> what armor
<Chimera> 04Hey Ascendant
<Chimera> 04Now I know why I'm using 3.0
<Ray> 02Imperial armor
<Chimera> 043D transforming X_X
<Soyuz> ..
<Griggs> why are you wearing heavy armor
<Griggs> rofl
<Griggs> you're not being a good mage
<Ray> 02:D
<Soyuz> I agree with Griggs for once
<Ray> 02Funfact: I know
<Soyuz> Heavy armor is for those that actually train in it
<Soyuz> like Orcs
<Griggs> We've only disagreed on one thing Soyuz
<Griggs> lol
<Soyuz> but I use Redoran Armor
<Soyuz> I know :P
<Soyuz> Ray; so then whats your armor rating
<Griggs> lol
<Soyuz> and skill for Heavy
<Ray> 023
<Soyuz> No wonder you die
<Soyuz> your like a..
<Griggs> bro
<Soyuz> what are they call?
<Griggs> Nub
<Soyuz> No
<Ray> 02Kthx
<Griggs> Restart your game dude
<Soyuz> those small creatures
<Griggs> Imp?
<Soyuz> like worms
<Griggs> oh
<Griggs> uhm...
<Soyuz> but paralize you
*Griggs shrugs
<Soyuz> anyways
<Ray> 02Oh, I know
<Griggs> I haven't played Morrowind in years
<Soyuz> whats your heavy armor skill Ray?
<Ray> 02Low, very very LOW.
<Soyuz> (though I'm guessing if its three than your only wearing a chestplate)
<Soyuz> or curicass
<Soyuz> as the world calls it
<Soyuz> I recommend you train with spells for the moment
<Ray> 02hmm..
<Soyuz> Dark elves are bad asses with spells
<Soyuz> it took me DAYS for my Orc to even get into disciple of the Temple
<Soyuz> but now he's Patriarch of it
<Soyuz> Typically Dark Elves can exceed at anything if you train them well
<Ray> 02O-o
<Soyuz> but with level 3, I'd recommend going to the major cities of Al'Ruhn
<Griggs> Why did you make yourself a mage when you're not doing any mage stuff
<Soyuz> or Ald'Rhun
<Soyuz> and Caledra
<Soyuz> *Caldera
<Soyuz> because you can get some good weapons and training at Al'Rhun
<Soyuz> and Caldera you can meet Creeper
<Ray> 02also, Soyuz
<Soyuz> and make a shit ton of gold
<Ray> 02tell me a way to get gold
<Ray> 02aside from looting people/houses
<Soyuz> Well there are numerous ways
<Soyuz> doing jobs for instances
<Soyuz> random jobs
<Soyuz> like side-quests
<Soyuz> hence doing that Boots of Blinding Speed
<Soyuz> there are maybe 2-3 Cliff Races on the way to the Marshes
<Ray> 02is that merchant "easy to kill"
<Soyuz> There are some other things like Guar
<Soyuz> She has a silver dagger
<Ray> 02Hmm..
<Soyuz> she was easy for me to kill
<Soyuz> for I'm an Orc
<Soyuz> and killed Umbra when I was on level 7
<Soyuz> So for you..
<Soyuz> practice killing rats with your sword
<Soyuz> make it go up to forty
<Soyuz> then go to Caldera
<Soyuz> follow the road
<Ray> 02maybe 5 fireballs and she's dead (I think ._.)
<Soyuz> you may ignore the naked Nord
<Soyuz> go to east
<Soyuz> then east
<Soyuz> find her
<Soyuz> and follow the signs to Hla Ode
<Ray> 02signs :D
<Soyuz> and by easy
<Soyuz> *east
<Soyuz> I mean go by the road via east
<Soyuz> there are two forks in the road
<Ray> 02yet another funfact: It took 3 hours of my life to get to balmore
<Soyuz> which causes confusion for the naked nords quest
<Soyuz> ..
<Soyuz> the fuck
<Soyuz> why didn't you use a Silt Strider
<Ray> 02I got lost :D
<Haseo> Who has a gaming computer
<Haseo> in here
<Soyuz> thats the fun part about Morrowind
<Soyuz> you get lost
<Soyuz> you find stuff you didn't even want to find
<Ray> 02Because I didn't knew of it's existence after a while
<Soyuz> and get money
<Soyuz> you do realize the first quest in the game
<Soyuz> is to go to Balmora
<Ray> 02yeah
<Soyuz> Anyways
<Ray> 02that's why I went there
<Soyuz> Ray, fuck the main quest
<Soyuz> don't do it for a long time
<Soyuz> save up for it
<Ray> 02.____.
<Soyuz> I didn't do the second quest of the main quest for..
<Soyuz> some 80 days
<Soyuz> for I was doing guild and Great Houses quests
<Soyuz> its alot easier
<Ray> 02yeah
<Soyuz> and if you wanna be a warrior join house Redoran
<Soyuz> fuck Telvanni
<Soyuz> and fuck Hlaaly
<Soyuz> *Hlaalu
<Soyuz> just opportunistics and isolationists
<Ray> 02.-.
<Soyuz> hlaalu is an Imperial Cock-sucker
<Soyuz> Basically
<Soyuz> and Telvanni, although mage, is against the mages guild
<Soyuz> and is very aggressive
<Soyuz> pro-foundly fond of Slavery
<Soyuz> your best bet morally
<Soyuz> and for warrior status
<Soyuz> is Redoran
<Ray> 02Hmm..
<Soyuz> Tell me your magic qualities as well

<drf|laptop> 03Hexic HD is such a mindf***
<Chimera> Hey
<Chimera> I'm kinda freaking out about this weekend x-x
<Chimera> I mean I'm probably stupid for worrying about the whole May 21st thing but still
<Chimera> ;-;
<Chimera> :/
<Quilava> whats going on? :|
<Chimera> Apparently
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Chimera> This guy is saying that the earth will end with a massive 5-month quake on May 21st
<Chimera> I really don't believe it hut
<Chimera> *but
<drf|laptop> 03hi
<Quilava> there is no logic behind that :|
<Chimera> The thought kinda digs into my mind and bothers me x-x
<Chimera> Well
<Chimera> He said that in the book of revalations, it's implied the earth will end 7,000 years after the great flood
<Chimera> And dating 7,000 after the event would be today's May 21st
<Quilava> ..how does he know the date of the great flood?
<Chimera> Hi
<Chimera> It was said to be the 17th of the second month apparently
<Chimera> Translating that off the Hebrew calander to todays calander apparently leads to this saturday
<Quilava> meh
<Quilava> I still don't really think the original date would be remembered this long
<Chimera> Well it was written down :P
<Chimera> But implications can be misinterprited
<Quilava> yeahh..
<Chimera> Let's HOPE it was misinterprited...
<SilverSonic> That world ending shit is a myth

<Ascendant> and occasionally -_- just to emphasize stuff
<DarkDragon> 3OHAI

<NightSeas> 12Welcome back :3
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohio
<Ascendant> I usually don't use LOL nowadays
<DarkDragon> 3So, what's the topic?
<HyperMetalLugia> I wonder who lives there
<Ascendant> only when something is actually funny
<Ascendant> which is kinda rare
<Altair> O_o
<HyperMetalLugia> Everything is funny to me XD
<Kyoko> 10DD, we're talking about old days
<DarkDragon> 3K.
<Ascendant> don't think I've used LOL on this network
<Ascendant> or at least seriously
<Ascendant> or meaning it
<Ascendant> I either use loooool to mean I find it funny
<Ascendant> LOL is only if it's really really really funny
<HyperMetalLugia> Altair is a derp
<Ascendant> and it's kinda uncharacteristic of me to use that, if you know what I mean
<Ascendant> Altair is cool lol
<DarkDragon> 3I'm poofing. Darn rabbits are eating mah garden!

<Steve> 12 Hello, Someone_Important and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Lambda> Who is this now?
<Someone_Important> Someone important.
<Stormy> it's neon
<Stormy> I think
<Someone_Important> I'm very important.
<Stormy> yep
<Stormy> definitely Neon
<Someone_Important> I mean: Im very importnt
<Lambda> And the truth shall be revealed!
<Stormy> Sorry, hostmask gave you away immediately
<Lambda> Sup Important_Neon
<Neon> I wasn't actually intending to make anyone wonder who it was. xD
<Stormy> I remember it because the first five digits are the same as mine
<Lambda> oh yeah
<Lambda> I never noticed that
<Lambda> so Neon
<Lambda> how are you?
<Log1x> i use it on mine whats up
<Neon> Eh, less than chipper.
<Neon> I just found out I don't get to visit any of my cousins that are in the army.
<Log1x> although i dont know how to fix it if u bricked ur router or something. mine was extremely easy to do =/
<Lambda> D:
<Lambda> why not?
<Log1x> i know a lot you have to do weird power cycles and crap
<Jason> Log1x: I was "tweaking" the settings on my router for firewall, and the config page no longer workd
<Jason> but I can ping the router
<Jason> ad telnet into it.
<Neon> Damn airfare. It's outrageous. Round trip it would cost me $600 bucks (plus air taxes) at the cheapest.
<Lambda> oh wow
<Lambda> where are they stationed?
<Log1x> did you try doing the hard reset thing
<Log1x> http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Hard_reset_or_30/30/30
<Jason> but I dont want to lose my crap D:
<Jason> I know how to fix it that way...
<Log1x> ;_; probably going to be inevitable if it wont let you login
<Neon> One's in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and the other's in North Carolina at Fort Bragg. That particular ticket would have been to Missouri, though.
<Log1x> unless its frozen or something
<Jason> Maybe just restart it
<Lambda> ah
<Log1x> but since ssh works :$
<Jason> I have too many connections open now
<Lambda> yeah, they aren't exctly right next door, huh?
<Lambda> *exactly
<Neon> Haha, nope. I'm right in the east coast.
<Neon> Driving would be so much cheaper, but my extended family doesn't want to for whatever reason.
*` yawns
<Armageddon> ;o

<Neon> Yeah, luckily slackerdom is easily remedied. :P
<`> it kept giving me random errors
<`> i swear to god
<Armageddon> Never really used anything to connect to the internet besides my laptop
<Armageddon> and DS/clirc
<`> there is somebody sitting at a keyboard
<`> when someone gets an error
<`> who just throws
<Armageddon> XD
<`> random numbers together
<`> and calls it an error
<Armageddon> lmao
<`> 'oh hmm this guy got an error on a Wii

*Jason hugs Log1x
<`> destroying the CD reader

<Armageddon> i'm at school
<Soyuz> fff

<`> ended up making it even WORSE
<Lambda> I should do a 'shop of this
<`> than before he started
<Armageddon> lmao
<Lambda> bounty hunter Stormy
<`> yet
<Neon> Hahaha, yes.
<`> he still insists that he's good
<Stormy> D:
<`> and that all this is is
<Neon> Should we use Samus as a base?
<`> 'trial and error'
<`> after fucking up on 50+ things
<Lambda> no, no, no
<Altair> lol
<Neon> That was sarcastic.
<Lambda> I was thinking more... trench coatish
<Altair> I modded mine, for the sole purpose to play pirated games
<Neon> Hm...
<`> lol
<Altair> Best $10 I ever spent
<`> he wasnt doing a mod like that
<`> he was doing a mod
<`> to make it look better.
<`> thats it.

<Altair> like
<`> how you fuck up on THAT?
<Altair> wtf
<`> i have no idea
<Altair> hurrdurr stickers

<Altair> fucking up soldering LEDs is one thing
<Stormy> what is with you and trench coats?
<Altair> though any little kid can do that
<Altair> but wat
<`> oh and did i mention the fact that
<`> when he first got a GCN
<Lambda> they look awesome
<`> he spent the better part of half an hour
<`> trying to find which slot the GCN cont goes into
<Neon> I have to agree. Trench coats make the world turn.
<`> eventually he figured out that it does indeed go into the front slot

<Nick> I am sad :'(
<Angel_Espeon> 13Train tickets are pretty expensive, plus it's pretty hard for me to get from here to Newcastle anyway ^^;

<prince-dari> The weather factory in MLP reminds me of one of the levels in Spyro.
<Lambda> I haven't gotten that far yet
<Lambda> in MLP
<Lambda> I just watched episode 2 last night :P
<prince-dari> Oh right. :P
<Lambda> http://www.halolz.com/2011/05/16/my-little-portal-2/
<prince-dari> Haha, wow.
<prince-dari> I was thinking the other day someone should edit the "I FUCKING LOVE COLOURING" picture to "I FUCKING LOVE PONIES", changing the colouring pencil to a pony. XD
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> it'd be awkward having the kid holding a pony like that
<prince-dari> Oh, there's a pony with a rainbow for a cutie mark.
<prince-dari> Oh, two. O_o
<Lambda> is it rainbow dash?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Lambda> no, rainbow dash has a lighning bolt
<Lambda> *lightning
<Lambda> amirite?
<prince-dari> A rainbow lightning bolt. :P
<Lambda> haha
<prince-dari> I'm starting to think Trollestia only have one eye, when do you ever see both? XD
<prince-dari> has*
<Lambda> hmm
<Lambda> now that you mention it you do only ever see one eye
<Lambda> cyclopestia
<Lambda> oh wait
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Stormy> Cyclotrollestia?
<Lambda> I'm thinking of the evil sister
<Lambda> who's trollestia?
<Lambda> or what
<Lambda> Stormy: Nice
<prince-dari> Trollestia is Celestia, she got renamed because she's such a troll.
<Stormy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sPwM3guang&feature=related
<prince-dari> Wait, Doctor Whooves grew wings for one episode? O___o
<prince-dari> I didn't notice that the first time I watched it.
<Lambda> Stormy: Yay!
<Lambda> also, is Dr. Whooves the official name?
<Isukra> 12back
<prince-dari> I don't think he has an official name.
<Lambda> it always sounds echo-y after hearing that song
<prince-dari> DO 15 BARREL ROLLS!

<prince-dari> You watched it for that long? XD
<Kosoveon> night
<Kosoveon> (late XD)
<Lambda> I consider it a challenge to watch all 10 minutes of it
<prince-dari> What was I supposed to see?
<Lambda> I be trollin' :P
<prince-dari> Lambda is Princess Trollestia's heir to the throne.
*Lambda removes headphones
<Lambda> I am temporarily home alone
<Lambda> nobody will know that I am listening to a pony say "yay"

<Lambda> mmm Jolly Ranchers jelly beans
<Lambda> or wait, no
<Lambda> Lifesavers jelly beans
<prince-dari> BEST DAY EVER!
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Lambda> when you watch something for 10 minutes straight
<Lambda> it starts to sound veeeerrrrrry strange
<prince-dari> Spitfire sounds like a character from Spyro.
<prince-dari> Not sure why.
<Lambda> it does
<Lambda> you should make a Spyrony
<prince-dari> Lol, Spike pretty much = Spyro.
<prince-dari> Young purple dragon.
<Lambda> true
<Lambda> I guess it would be hard to do much to make him look different
<Lambda> oh wait
<Lambda> I thought you were saying he's already kinda like a pony
<prince-dari> This guy's desktop is awesome: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130561200481.png

<prince-dari> Sixth formers are people in the final two years of school BTW.
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> see, I instantly thought sixth graders
<Lambda> meaning 11 year olds :P
<prince-dari> Yeah, well this was 17-19 year olds. :P
<Lambda> even better!
<Lambda> would that make you a fifth former?
<prince-dari> Well that's the old system for naming the years in school, people only use sixth form to name the optional years of school after the age of 16, none of the previous years.
<Lambda> ah
<prince-dari> I'm year 11.
<prince-dari> Sixth formers describes people in year 12 and 13.
<Lambda> so you're only required to go to school until you're 16?

<DarkTruth> initial release is going to be 8 core 6 core and 4 core

<Jason> Why dont you just put out like 10% more money and get an intel.
<DarkTruth> basically the module shares certain hardware portions between the two cores
<Cat> because I'm happy with my current cpu, Jason?
<Cat> there probably isn't *that* much difference between them anyway
<DarkTruth> yea I have a I5 760 and I have a phenom II x4 impressed with them both
<DarkTruth> not really cat
<Jason> Cat: I meant when you got it..
<DarkTruth> trust me I have played with enough hardware lol
<Cat> it's like the difference between ati and nvidia
<Cat> that is, not very much
<DarkTruth> its negligible
<Cat> except maybe one brand tends to be slightly cheaper
<Jason> and the other tends to be better ;)
<Cat> I don't like you, Jason
<DarkTruth> I prefer Nvidia myself but thats just preference
<Cat> I use nvidia
<Cat> seems nice enough
<Jason> Cat: Meh, just saying my honest opinion, I have always used intel, and I like it, its trustworthy..
<Jason> mmm double chocolate cake ::)
<DarkTruth> I have always used both ..... but when intel was running with netburst architecture I was staying with AMD
<Cat> if you've always used intel, how do you know amd is so crap?
<DarkTruth> netburst was just eww
<Cat> what's netburst all about?
<Cat> I've used both intel and amd
<DarkTruth> it was the old pentium 4 architecture
<Jason> Cat: My mom has AMD on her laptop, and its pretty slow
<DarkTruth> read about it
<Cat> our pc at home used to have a Pentium 4
<Cat> then I "upgraded" it
<Cat> by which I mean I threw away everything but the hard drive and replaced them
<Jason> hehe.
<DarkTruth> lol
<Jason> my internet speed is 10/1
<Jason> I pay for 25/1

<Jason> England has pretty fast internet
<Jason> pretty much all of europe does

<Cat> so probably the connection for the whole halls, spread across pretty much just my pc
<Cat> :P
<Jason> DarkTruth: My speed is usually at 30mbit... its just screwed atm.
<DarkTruth> that sucks
<Cat> my internet at home is awful

<Guest44409> I ate her
<Neon> You... you what?
<Lambda> Stormy!
<Lambda> Nooooooo!
<Lambda> Ah
<Lambda> there you are
<prince-dari> Lambda: You know that video with the sword guy you posted? Well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVpyhO7otYA

<Neon> Watch that until the end, and I assure you there will be no disappointment.

<prince-dari> Yeah.
<prince-dari> Neon: What is that video you posted?
<Neon> Are you familiar with hotdiggedydemon?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Lambda> me neither
<Neon> He's an animator, affiliated with Newgrounds. Anyway, read the description. It explains it perfectly.
<prince-dari> Slow buffering.
<Neon> It's a ten minute video. :P
<prince-dari> Why'd they kill his dog?
<Neon> Did you finish it?
<prince-dari> Well music is playing for the end.
<Neon> That's not even important. Embrace how facetious the ending was.
<prince-dari> I dunno, I'm just surprised that furries...Killed the dog - you'd have thought they'd do something else. :P
<Neon> Yeah... maybe they did so before they killed it.
<prince-dari> Or afterwards.
<Neon> Of course. They always come by for seconds.
<Stormy> ...awkward
<Neon> Careful, Stormy. It is pitch dark.
*Lambda is here to protect Stormy
<Lambda> she need not worry about anything
<prince-dari> You can't protect her from a grue. :o
<Neon> No amount of protection you can provide will matter.

<junh1024-XD> so nickstr, M5/7 BD is out

<nickstr> and I don't want it

<nickstr> yes
<junh1024-XD> \and the colours still have that turqouise tint
<nickstr> is it two discs are just one
<nickstr> if its two I can just throw the Destiny Deoxys disc aside and forget about it
<junh1024-XD> oh whaat
<junh1024-XD> DL or flippie?
<nickstr> no
<nickstr> two SEPARATE discs
<junh1024-XD> nono,
<nickstr> EWW
<nickstr> EWW
<nickstr> EWW
<junh1024-XD> is the current release a DL or flippie?
<nickstr> EWW
<nickstr> EWW
<nickstr> I don't know
<nickstr> that is why I asked you
<junh1024-XD> i dont' know either
<nickstr> if its both movies combined into one disc I would rather pirate it
<junh1024-XD> oh, dw, drf'll prolly upload it sometime
<nickstr> because I don't want to buy ANY Advanced Generation TV show or movie ANYTHING
<nickstr> if its two separate discs I could perhaps justify it
<junh1024-XD> and sound is stereo btw, apparently
<nickstr> and just destroy the Destiny Deoxys disc or give it to someone else
<junh1024-XD> good: if it's native, not upscaled.
<junh1024-XD> bad: it was surround on the DVD
<nickstr> EWW EWW EWW EWW EWW EWW EWW EWW
<nickstr> ITS A SINGLE DISC
<nickstr> EWW EWW
<junh1024-XD> also, NB: M5HD apparently airing on KIDS. better than this BD, HOpefully (colour, less cuts, etc)
<nickstr> no
<nickstr> I want the English version
<nickstr> cuts and all
<nickstr> no BS restored version
<nickstr> I would say bullspit but EWW CURSING KICK
<junh1024-XD> so was my restored version BS?
<nickstr> its because I don't want those
<nickstr> I am trying to avoid buying this bundle because EWW ADVANCED GENERATION
<nickstr> so I want the English dubbed version AS IT APPEARS ON THE DISC!
<nickstr> no filtering
<nickstr> no "cut restores"
<nickstr> nothing
<nickstr> just a raw rip from the disc
<nickstr> or MPEG AVC transport stream
<nickstr> preferably the second of the two
<nickstr> but either way NO CHANGES
<nickstr> I want to AVOID buying this
<nickstr> but want Pokemon Heroes in HD
<nickstr> untouched
<nickstr> and dubbed in English

<nickstr> but I guess this criteria might be too much to ask so I guess I have no choice but to bite the bullet and swallow my pride at the same time and buy the movie along with a Blu Ray drive
<junh1024-XD> >>oh, dw, drf'll prolly upload it sometime
<nickstr> ENGLISH DUBBED
<nickstr> UNTOUCHED
<nickstr> those are key words here
<junh1024-XD> yes
<nickstr> that means no filtering and no cut restores
<junh1024-XD> >uploading a BDMV
<nickstr> from the screen shot given there it looks fine
<junh1024-XD> >drf bothering to touch it
<junh1024-XD> >mfw
<nickstr> all I ask for is the Pokemon Heroes portion only
<nickstr> so it should be smaller
<nickstr> not the whole disc
<junh1024-XD> most people want both
<nickstr> not me
<nickstr> because EWW ADVANCED GENERATION
<junh1024-XD> you'll either have to download all of it, or ask someone which m2ts is M5
<nickstr> because the distributer is run by a bunch of idiots
<nickstr> movies 4 and 5 would have made far more sense
<nickstr> Mirimax has the rights to both
<junh1024-XD> think about this:
<junh1024-XD> 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, etc
<junh1024-XD> if.
<junh1024-XD> we'll see if STARZ_HD bloadcasts a proper M4 in HD,
<junh1024-XD> because all "HD" M4 i've seen or heard so far is really, an SD upscale (FILMBOX, TX/K)
<nickstr> if Netflix had it available I could rent the bundle, rip Pokemon Heroes only, and send it back
<nickstr> provided I buy a Blu Ray drive first
<junh1024-XD> ohohoho
<junh1024-XD> i brought one a month+? ago because i wanz my HDz and i am limited by internets.
<junh1024-XD> provided my local rental has it (and half+ the time they don't)
<nickstr> in my case its because I am giving the format second thoughts
<nickstr> and positive ones in this case
<nickstr> plus it would be a good idea to handle all if not most optical disc formats currently in use
<junh1024-XD> well, BD is one of the onry legal ways that they are distributing movies on HD.
<junh1024-XD> you can AVCHD-DVD, but baisically nooone commercial movie studios use those
<nickstr> if I bought the bundle myself I might either resell the disc or destroy it
<nickstr> microwave oven looks attractive for that purpose
<nickstr> then shredder after that
<junh1024-XD> don't microwave discs. i've tried it. it makes your oven smell bad.
<nickstr> it creates a nice light show though
<nickstr> or run it over with a car or bicycle
<nickstr> gravel road
<nickstr> or if I rip it and then resell it in a short enough time period it will not depreciate much
<nickstr> maybe by around one or two dollars
<nickstr> still quite significant in value

<NightSeas> 12I had a hard time finding this for some reason, lol
<NightSeas> 12Awesome though XDD
<nickstr> its catchy
<nickstr> my cat is staring at the cat on the screen
<NightSeas> 12lol
*nickstr np: unknown - Nyan Cat [03:36m/0kbps/44kHz]
*junh1024-XD np: Nyan Cat - Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya! MP3@185kps
<nickstr> to make the WTF factor greater I am playing this into my AM stereo transmitter/signal generator
<nickstr> its actually being sent over the air on 1500 KHz AM
<NightSeas> 12XD
<nickstr> so there is a double whammy in its self
<NightSeas> 12How much does a AM signal generator cost?
<nickstr> several hundred dollars to several thousands
<nickstr> mine was about $80
<NightSeas> 12Ah
<nickstr> because its a simple transmitter I built from a kit
<nickstr> its output is C-QUAM AM stereo and in my setup I can output on 1250, 1450, and 1500
<NightSeas> 12Well that’s awesome, I had no idea those where even affordable
<nickstr> the thing is this one was a very short run kit
<nickstr> only about 13 were made
<nickstr> the sound quality output of this is very high as well and the only radio I have which does it justice is a car stereo made by Delco electronics in 1990
<NightSeas> 12How often do you usally have it sending off a signal?
<NightSeas> 12usually*
<nickstr> every once in a while
<nickstr> sometimes for making sure the AM receivers I have work properly but much of the time its to play my own selection of music on air

<Ripred> 4my computer blacked out over your last 2 messages
<Lakorv> lool, RSE remakes
<Quanyails> 7Ah, but the original R/S normally did not have that item.
<Ripred> 4brb
<Lakorv> that's when you know the world's moved on.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Do not deny the fact you lost, Ripred ~
<Chimera> 04yes it did
<Quanyails> 7It was only a mystery gift that allowed it?
<Chimera> 04you silly
<Chimera> 04true but
<Lakorv> I consider RSE too new for remakes .-.
<Chimera> 04the Soul Dew still is void from Gen 5 :3
<Lakorv> also, good night people.
<Chimera> 04eh
<Chimera> 04cya]
<Chimera> 04but
<Lakorv> Minnet: get off the network
<Quanyails> 7I'd wait for 2014.
<Minnet> Okay, bye!
<Chimera> 04RSE kinda are old...
<xxLatiosxx> 12I will LOL if this new 3DS Pokémon game is Pokémon Grey or something
<Quanyails> 7That'd make B/W already obsolete! D:
<Chimera> 04yeh
<Quanyails> 7Well, I'm gonna go play piano.
<Cat> I could make a site, as long as you aren't too bothered about custom images for the site design and javascript stuff
<Cat> :O
<Angel_Espeon> 13Have fun o3o
<Cat> technically I probably could do javascript
<Jason> :OO
<Jason> You could?
<Jason> Cat:
<Jason> :)
<Cat> not for free
<Cat> maybe for like, a tenner
<Jason> how much?
<Cat> or 20
<Jason> ill give you $3
<Manlyguy> lol
<Cat> no
<Jason> xD
<Cat> that's like, 3 pence
<Cat> or something
<Jason> Will it be good?
<Cat> it'll conform to standards!
<Cat> also, it really depends on what exactly you want the site to do
<Angel_Espeon> 13Manly guys don't say lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13Manly guys say AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
*Angel_Espeon is shot
<Angel_Espeon> 13Don't ask
<Angel_Espeon> 13;w;
<Manlyguy> I don't think I will. AHAHAHAHAHAHA
<xxLatiosxx> 12I don't know why I just thought of Hiker trainers in Pokémon.
<Jason> EVERYTHING
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Jason> IT SHALL FTP HOOKERS
<Jason> no.
<Jason> I want it to display plans for my server sales.
<Cat> you're selling servers?
<Manlyguy> God, everything thinks of the wrong type of manly. My name was based off James Bond. lol
<Spyrorocks`> I have a webhosting site i never got going
<Spyrorocks`> globalmax.com
<Spyrorocks`> and a design
<Spyrorocks`> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2827825/gmax/index.htm
<Jason> lemme see
<Spyrorocks`> one day ill get it up.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I think you've said before that your username wasn't formed the way people probably think it was xD
<Kosoveon> too many people think manly=muscular
<Jason> The thing is an image, though
<Angel_Espeon> 13Didn't know it originated from there though o3o
<Jason> Could I (you) tweak it so you can put in text instead?
<Spyrorocks`> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2827825/gmax/template.htm
<xxLatiosxx> 12I love dr pepper
<Kosoveon> by that definition, I am the least manly person on the entire earth XD
<Spyrorocks`> you cant use it
<Spyrorocks`> im just showing you an example of what I have
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 8Fraxure.

<SheenaFox> hi Angel
<SheenaFox> hi HML
<Kosoveon> hi Sheena
<Manlyguy> It's the smooth talking, gentleman-type manly, not overexploded muscular dude who wrestles bears every morning. lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<xxLatiosxx> 12Like a smoothie
<Jason> I see
<Angel_Espeon> 13But what if the manly I have in mind is a smooth talking, overexposed muscular gentleman who wrestles bears every morning?
<Jason> You want to buy a server from me :D ??
<Jason> xD
<Kosoveon> that's quite a contrast XD
<Spyrorocks`> heh
<Manlyguy> Then you better lay off the drugs, because you're living a dream. lmfao
<Spyrorocks`> I already have a managed vps lined up
<xxLatiosxx> 12Okay lets see what I get this time

<Ripred> 4I got halfway through before he said he forgot his wallet
<xxLatiosxx> 12Unown = my least favourite LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also, sugar paper is tasty
<Spyrorocks`> where are you reselling from? softlayer?
<xxLatiosxx> 12My first ever shiny = Unown. =<
<xxLatiosxx> 12MY LUCK IS GREAT
<Ripred> 4Im talking college ruled
<Ripred> 4xD
<Nick> swadloon
<Kosoveon> candy cane paper
<Kosoveon> ftw <3
<Kosoveon> and yes, it exists
<Nick> thats not the thing that evolves into the pink huge headed jellyfish with lipstick is it?
<Manlyguy> Lol, Ripred. That's nothing. My friend did it for free. xD
<Jason> no
<Jason> vstarvps
<xxLatiosxx> 12It's that grass thing that looks like it uses itself as a blanket
<Angel_Espeon> 13xxLatiosxx ate seaweed for free simply because I dared her to :D
*Angel_Espeon RUNS
<xxLatiosxx> 12NO

<Spyrorocks`> india?
*Nick also has a gun an ak with 100 round drum on finding out that swadloon does evolve into giant headed pink jellyfish with lipstick
<Ripred> 4for the lulz
<Nick> AAAAAAAAAHHHHH! *rataatatatatatat
<Manlyguy> Drinking water from a dirty sock is also a good dare. I forget which of my friends did that.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh god
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<Cat> sounds dodgy to me
<xxLatiosxx> 12don't get any ideas
<Manlyguy> Far less pleasant than it sounds.
<Jason> Spyrorocks`: company is in india, yes
<Jason> but the VPS work
<Manlyguy> At least, for the people watching. xD
<Jason> I can give you a trial
<Spyrorocks`> it looks like its hosted from india
<Kosoveon> someone dared someone else in my physics class today to spread out their hand on a table and stab in between the spaces of their fingers for a full five minutes with a sharpened pencil
<Spyrorocks`> its alright im alredy with softlayer
<Kosoveon> without hitting the skin for like $10
<Kosoveon> obviously no one did it for real....but some tried though XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13I have friends who can do that really well o-o
<Angel_Espeon> 13I can't do it at all though |D
<Manlyguy> DUDE. I tried that after watching Aliens. XD
<Kosoveon> I tried it with an eraser...I am pretty good at it
<Manlyguy> Except that it was with the rubber side of a pencil. I'd like to keep my fingers, haha.
<Kosoveon> but with a sharpened pencil....? I'd be way more jittery XD
<Jason> Spyrorocks`: I can get you 32tB BW (250GB HDD + 3GB RAM) in germany for $32/mo
<Spyrorocks`> I want usa
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've seen a friend try it with an actual knife >.>;
<Kosoveon> they actually proposed using a knife
<Kosoveon> yeah
<Kosoveon> x.x
<Jason> What HDD space you looking for?
<Manlyguy> That is how you live life. lol
<Kosoveon> people just WANT to have their body parts mangled apparently
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lovely stuff
<Kosoveon> suck the marrow out of life
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<Kosoveon> to borrow words from thoreau :P
<Kosoveon> quite literally
<Manlyguy> That reminds me of the time I jumped in rose bushes with my friends. We didn't know they were because it was nighttime, but we did know after one of my friends yelled in pain. Then we laughed at him while we held back out own pain.
<Jason> Spyrorocks`: What HDD space you looking for?
<Spyrorocks`> its alright
<Spyrorocks`> dont bother
<Cat> lol
<Ripred> 4Why were you jumping in bushes?
<Kosoveon> that would be supremely painful
<Kosoveon> I'd done it
<Ripred> 4DOING SOMTHING BAD AND RUNNING FROM THE COPS?
<Kosoveon> accidentally though XD
<Manlyguy> No.
<Spyrorocks`> you need to find a niche if you want to sell servers and stuff
<Manlyguy> We were trying to scare drivers passing by.
<Spyrorocks`> you cant just say everyone is your target customer
<Manlyguy> Actually, yeah, it was bad.
<Manlyguy> xD
<Jason> seedboxes
<Jason> +vps's
<Angel_Espeon> 13I used to have rose bushes in my garden
<Jason> I have made 2 sales
<Spyrorocks`> good
<Angel_Espeon> 13and everyone who visited seemed to fall into them at some point
<Spyrorocks`> keep doing that
<Angel_Espeon> 13I have no idea why o-o
<Ripred> 4xD
<Jason> And its recurring, so thats good
<Ripred> 4I rememebr waiting for the bus one day after a snow
<Nick> bed time night all
<Spyrorocks`> you need to pretty much sign up 20-30 customers a day
<Ripred> 4someone threw a snowball at a car
<Ripred> 4(no it wasnt me )
<Kosoveon> night nick
<Ripred> 4and the guy pulled over
<Ripred> 4and chased us xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Goodnight Nick :3
<Spyrorocks`> start an affiliate program and give a lot per customer.
<Kosoveon> what's messed up is, the only way to get a shortcut to my school is to go through a bunch of thorny bushes and muddy sand
<Jason> :OO
<Jason> I barely make any profit myself
<Kosoveon> and I choose that route than get stuck in super congested and heavy traffic XD
<xxLatiosxx> 12Goodnight!
<Manlyguy> You're lucky he didn't turn the whole car around to chase you, Ripred. A lot of people are like that in my parts, haha.
<Cat> I can't see how it's worth it
<Ripred> 4xD
<Guest6769> 03*WB02(Jerry02)03WB* - <Jerry> 02I'm back to chat and eat cookies. Wait..I dont have any.
<Jerry> Heya guys :D
<Spyrorocks`> you wont make any money in the next 6 months to 1 year
<Kosoveon> hi Jerry :D
<Jerry> Kosovo!!!!
<Spyrorocks`> but after that you will start to see a good return if you do what I say.
*Jerry glomps Kosovo~
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Jerry :3
<Jerry> ANGEL_ESPEON :DDD *glomps A_E*
*Kosoveon is glomped
*Angel_Espeon is also glomped :o
<Spyrorocks`> you have to ask yourself, is this a serious business or a hobby?
<Manlyguy> Oy, the glomps never end.
*Kosoveon glomps Manlyguy
<Jerry> yeah :)
<Kosoveon> :P
<Manlyguy> . -.
<Jason> Look, I just want a damn dedi
*Jerry glomps Manlyguy
<Spyrorocks`> your only selling to get yourself a dedicated server?
<Jason> thats all I am doing this for
<Jason> yes.
*Kosoveon glomps the chat
<Jason> I need $75/mo
<Jason> I am too young for a job
<Spyrorocks`> you wont get any serious customers then, just friends.
<Spyrorocks`> you are never too young to work.
<Spyrorocks`> dont ever use that excuse.
<Jason> I am
*Jerry glomps everyone in the chat list including Cube
<Jason> I applied in 2 places, both said I am too young
<Cat> do a paper round or chores for people
<Aeroslash> eep!
<Manlyguy> I still don't fit in after nearly two years. xD
*Aeroslash is glomped
<Aeroslash> hi Jerry! ^^
<Kosoveon> you fit in just as much as I do, manly. :P
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 6Anorith.
<Jason> I said work, not slaving
<xxLatiosxx> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> xxLatiosxx, you are a 2Kyogre.
<xxLatiosxx> 12SURFS UP DOODS
<Kosoveon> quite the contrast .-.
<Manlyguy> You sure? I do hold back quite a chunk of my personality, mostly because I'd get banned if I showed it. A lot of people say I'm mean RL, but that's just me being me. xD
<Kosoveon> but you aren't mean D:
<Cat> there's a difference?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Kyogre
<Jerry> AERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Angel_Espeon> 13y u eat mah shoes
<Angel_Espeon> 13:c
<Jerry> AEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Cat> I said jobs, not a career
<Jason> meh
<xxLatiosxx> 12THEY TASTY
*Jerry glomps Aeroslash :DDDDDDDD
<Manlyguy> Did you even read the first sentence. XD
<xxLatiosxx> 12MOAR
<Aeroslash> lol
<Kosoveon> yes
<Kosoveon> I did :P
<Aeroslash> hi Jerry
<Jerry> HEEEEEEEEEEEY
<Aeroslash> HEYYYYY!
<Manlyguy> How about the second? lmfao
<Jerry> LIKE, I HAVENT SEEN YOU IN A WHILE
<Cat> I still don't get what exactly you need a $75 a month dedicated server for?
<Aeroslash> IKR?!
<Kosoveon> yes, lol
<Kosoveon> I've read the seventh sentence too
<Chimera> 04http://14-bis.deviantart.com/art/Blue-Umbreon-195032071 this is freaking awesome
<Steve> 12 Hello, Neon and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<xxLatiosxx> 12that is really awesome =o
<Kosoveon> a lot of my personality is different here too
<Lambda> Yo
<Kosoveon> for instance, I'm WAY more shy irl
<Cat> I mean, if you want it for storage, you could get a massive-sized HDD for much cheaper
<Manlyguy> I'm a prankster RL. I don't pull any lol stunts on TST. On other sites, yes, but not TST. xD
<Kosoveon> and a lot less talkative and outspoken
<Angel_Espeon> 13My online personality is the person that I am on the inside, that most people don't give me a chance to show irl |D
<Cat> something of that price is totally not worth it for online gaming
<Jerry> o.o
*Jerry pokes a Angel_Espeon
<Jason> I need a fast speed
<Jason> fast speeds*
<xxLatiosxx> 12I have no idea to describe mine
<Jason> at least 100mbit
<Jerry> same with Latios
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm really quiet and shy on the outside irl, but once I feel more comfortable around someone I start to open up and show my true colours :P
<Cat> why?
<Jason> With the server, I get: 3TB HDD 16GB RAM 100mbit unmetered,
<Kosoveon> same here
<Manlyguy> Everyone seems to be like that here, haha.
<Kosoveon> it takes a lot to really get me to open up
<Jerry> because
<Spyrorocks`> Jason, voluemdrive.com
<Spyrorocks`> cheap
<Jerry> We're awesome
<Jerry> :D
*Jerry shot
<Quanyails|AFK> 7Back.
<Spyrorocks`> volumedrive.com
<xxLatiosxx> 12=D
<Jerry> wb~
<Angel_Espeon> 13Of course, most people don't have much interest in giving me the opportunity to open up, so .-.
*xxLatiosxx high fives Jerry
<Spyrorocks`> Jason, whats your age
<Kosoveon> not that I'm reclusive or whatever
*Jerry high fives back
<xxLatiosxx> 12Hehe your name rhymes with Cherry
<Cat> he's like 15 or something
<Jason> Spyrorocks`: 14
<Cat> I was close!
<Kosoveon> but most people IRL are idiots or jerks so ._.
<Cat> sweet
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya
<Spyrorocks`> I was programming for people when I was 14
<Kosoveon> thankfully tst isn't like that :>
<HyperMetalLugia> Creepycool pic
<Manlyguy> Lol, Kosovo. XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Late
<Spyrorocks`> theres always something you can do.
<HyperMetalLugia> But bah
<Jerry> Kosoveon: there are still a handfull of people that arent. :D you just gotta find the right people
<Jerry> HML
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol Kosoveon, I can relate to that
<Jerry> HEY YOU
<Spyrorocks`> my brother is 11 and he just sold a website of his for $350
*Jerry pokes a HML~
<Spyrorocks`> had a monthly profit of $100
<HyperMetalLugia> x.x
<HyperMetalLugia> Hey
<Spyrorocks`> no joke.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Almost everyone in my year during my time at secondary school seemed to find reasons to make fun of me for some reason >>;
<Kosoveon> that's true @jerry
<Spyrorocks`> anyways I gtg, got work to do :P
<Kosoveon> same XD
<Jerry> yeah~ anyway! how has everyone been?
<Jason> :OO
<Jason> laters
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's the main reason why I especially have trouble opening up to guys irl, but let's not go into that |D
<xxLatiosxx> 12High school = LOLdramalamaplace
<Quanyails> 7Ah, high school.
<Manlyguy> Man, I got lucky. I made all my friends in preschool, and I had two older brothers already in my school, so I couldn't get made fun of without any backup.
<Kosoveon> a lot of the friends I've made over my lifetime have either moved or betrayed me in some way
<Jerry> Kosoveon: that sucks.
<Cat> what do you need such a fast server for?
<Kosoveon> that's why I'm a lot more cautious
<Jason> Many things
<Jerry> I still have alot of bffs that I still keep in contact with :3
<xxLatiosxx> 12You know they're worth it if they stay in contact with you
<Jason> first of all, security
<Jason> I need a VPN
<Angel_Espeon> 13Most of the friends I've made in the past have just used me as a stepping stone to get to the "better" groups >>;
<xxLatiosxx> 12its a two way thing though
