<Jaketehsnake> so, will Bronystate only stream hearts and hooves or the entire marathon?
<Jewel> Well that is a very complex fording system
<gaybrony91> were we arguing? im sorry...
*Tovler googles it

<Xionponychan> eh...
<The_4th_Wall> Tiny Toons are anti-SOPA
<ncb_LuckyStampede> I think this is the latest I've made it
<Dark_Horst2> we crack up all the censors... yeah i9 imagine that
<CalycibosOfBjor> So..Much...Color...
<Tyr> screw sleep, this is an aawesome dose of childhood

<AliVega> nostalgia
<Tovler> AFTER SCHOOL CARTOONS

<ncb_LuckyStampede> Funny that furries killed this show
<Dtox> how so?
<Xionponychan> MahBoi777: are you okay :(
<ncb_LuckyStampede> eh, look up the history
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Random thought: Too bad Animaniacs aren't on air today, they would have A LOT of new material to make fun of with today's shows.
<Shizuka> 13and now our song is done
<Tovler> What did you 00s watch after school?
<Dtox> how did furries kill this show?
<Jewel> Wait did they really?
<ncb_LuckyStampede> bronies are bizarro furries
<PartyCannon> SuperBrony64 IKR???
<The_4th_Wall> Yu-gi-oh
<Fluttertastic> my childhood has returned holy crap.
<The_4th_Wall> Pokemon
<Tovler> I've never seen 00s r34 toons
<Buytoast> Animaniacs would probably get taking down in days from overly butt hurt asshatters
<Red_Pegasus> Wasn't there another version of this? Where there was a Granny and the loonys?
<Dark_Horst2> i think someon
<ncb_LuckyStampede> Similar but bizarro different

<Rainbowjack> lol
<Xionponychan> MahBoi777: heh okay :)

<RawketLawnchair> That armor isn't very well designed. The scaled bit should be on the other arm in order to provide more stability for the shield. If it's on that arm, it just makes swinging the sword harder.
<Jewel> Wheel of Comedy
<ncb_LuckyStampede> Buck no. I've just followed history
<Rainbowjack> love the pink bunny
<RawketLawnchair> See?

<CalycibosOfBjor> I meant if it takes place on an established world, or is its own separate planet.
<Colt_Magnum> equestria is a planet and celestia is dumbledore
<derpy_pony> you need portals to get there, CalycibosOfBjor
<MahBoi777> Shadowmere you are a champion
<Colt_Magnum> equestria is a nation**

<TeamDerpy> derp
<Dark_Horst2> it seems
<Polydunami> For now, I think
<Shadowmere> that planet they found could be Equestria? You know the one that real close and can sustain life?
<CalycibosOfBjor> Is it going to be blank until the marathon. I hope not.
<derpy_pony> hunting ponies is not for everyone
<The_4th_Wall> I like to think Equestria is the alternate universe to earth
<redmoon> equestria is a country: ep 1x01, right at the beginning: once upon a time, in the magical LAND of equestria...
<HurrHurr> rip stream </3
<Xionponychan> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

<Drake> 04Nah
<Drake> 04I don't want him to
<MahBoi777> one-man band
<Guidingarc> His lungs must be THAT big
<Phase4> Kammerjunk: #SillyFilly
<Kammerjunk> Too late.
<Armageddon> Because Rhy doesn't always take her fighter on missions
<Drake> 04Keep that to Leo and Rhy
<Volmise> I need a link to this.
<Jay911> suddenly parasprites thousands of them
<Drake> 04Like you said he can have basic training
<Volmise> Have a friend who would die.
<Armageddon> Helicopters should have more than enough firepower
<Ictiv> Starflash: I keep my sense in my pinkie finger
<Drake> 04But I'd rather him not
<derpy_pony> If you travel from the Schengen zone to the US, is a normal id card enough? Or do you need a passport or even a visa?
<Armageddon> Actually
<twispy> TIME TRAVEL
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> I think this guy also did U.N. Owen Was Her?
<Starflash> good answer
<Armageddon> we probably would have a specialised pilot
<theawesomebrony> sup
<Polydunami> Hey brony
<Armageddon> since we're going on missions
<Starflash> Ictiv: 10 pts
<ArteAlen> Hey bronies. Exicted about 5h of ponies? :3
<Sumica> 00,10indeed Gabe
<Armageddon> and the heli has to go somewhere
<RainbowDash48> sup dude
<Drake> 04And we don't always go on missions alone
<Egrus> Oh my, this guy doesn't need more arms than two
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> Play it Sumica after this
<Shadowmere> Hell Yeah!
<Kenrick55> I can write the letter 'A'. U jelly?
<Polydunami> I'm worried I might fall asleep
<Drake> 04Sometimes other teams back us up
<Armageddon> wel
<Dken2021> lali-ho ArteAlen
<Ictiv> 10 points?
<Armageddon> well yeah, that'd be cool
<Scootaloo> I don't even know http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/129892
<Ictiv> Alright
<Armageddon> but we'll have to have a pilot
<Cabooselololol> y does it say 56 minutes till pony? is the episode early?
<Drake> 04yeah
<rebound> He's needs someone to do the percussion
<Sumica> 00,10marathon
<Amras0000> Mare-a-thon
<ArteAlen> marathon
<Cabooselololol> oh kool
<Jay911> Caboose: hub marathon
*Ictiv tosses 10 points on the Australlia sized pile of points.
<MahBoi777> Scootaloo: WAHAHAAAA
<Rainbowjack> WE<3PONIES Mare-a-thon
<PONI> I thought the marethon was for valintines...
<Drake> 04And the pilot can complain that "Everytime Rhy takes the controls, the damn thing crashes"
<Dken2021> rebound ikr?
*Drake runs
<Armageddon> normally Rhy insists on piloting it
<Cypresswolf> Well Played! *Applause*
<Starflash> they are entirely useless points though, except for the fact that you now have more of these than the others
<Armageddon> yes lmfao
<Jay911> (yay)
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> did he died?
<CalycibosOfBjor> gimme a straight answer. why are we not having any megas.
<Armageddon> Rhy's pretty damn insane at it though
<CalycibosOfBjor> ?
<Dken2021> now that's what I call multi-tasking
<Shadowmere> asians did it...
<Sundaysmile> he needs a breather
<Armageddon> everyone complains about her flying
<Armageddon> but she's one of the best pilots
<Drake> 04Apache DO A BARREL ROLL
<Armageddon> lmao
<Drake> 04And NS
<Drake> 04I had the idea
<Armageddon> when dodging fire, YES
<Kenrick55> I'm an asian and I can't do that!
<MahBoi777> I LOVE THIS
<PONI> I love this.
<Drake> 04of Rhy piloting the Skyscraper at an important mission
<XaviortheSavior> lol
<fluttercry> 05,15oh hai everyone...

<_L1pE_BR> oh hai mark
<Egrus> Hahahaha THIS
<NOT_TIM> oh wow i havent heard this song in ... wow
<rebound> hahah!
<Armageddon> lmao
<Scavender> DAYUM
<RainbowDash48> XD
*Starflash hugs fluttercry
<Shrimp3000> ugh, i'll be back in an hour
<Drake> 04That she gets nicknamed the "Demon of <Location>"
<rebound> Demoman CAN'T TOUCH THIS
<Armageddon> hahahahahaha
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> Ohai fluttercry
<_L1pE_BR> hahaha what a story mark
<Noir> Lol
<Dken2021> CalycibosOfBjor Luna usually streams megas, but she's not here now, plus, she's stream the whole two seasons
<Armageddon> that'd be cool
<Chelly> xD
<Drake> 04My first thought was the "Demon of Singapore
<Polydunami> Oh my GOODNESS
<Drake> 04for some reason
<Rainbowjack> HEAVY!!!
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, fluttercry.
<MahBoi777> and MEDIC
<Armageddon> except we'd have to be careful not to overpower that
<Polydunami> dat burn the rope
<PONI> I love this burn the rope song.
<fluttercry> 05,15hi
<NOT_TIM> burn the rope?
<Drake> 04I know
<Phase4> and now i need some water
<Drake> 04But as you said, she's an exceptional pilot
<Armageddon> since technically evading 5-10 craft /might/ be okay, but not more than that
<CalycibosOfBjor> Awwww. Why do all the good shows get put on when I'm not around.
<Dken2021> mario?
<Futttershy_is_dovaki> pingas
<Drake> 04yeah
<Armageddon> hell, 10's probably a bit too much
<rebound> NOSTALDIA >_<
<Drake> 04I mean
<Armageddon> especially since they'll be human pilots
<fluttercry> 05,15for some reason my house feels like it's slightly above freezing
<MahBoi777> WHOA
<Armageddon> if there's AI
<Phase4> fluttercry: with your colours its hard to see the left of the h. so i read that as ni
<XaviortheSavior> metal!
<Drake> 04Taking down more than 4 aircraft is a huge feat
<Cabooselololol> Mario :D
<Armageddon> then 10 would be fine
<Armageddon> yeah
<_L1pE_BR> noice
<Drake> 04well
<MahBoi777> that's sick XDDD
<Shadowmere> Metal MLp FIM theme
<Plotbuster> that's metal...
<Drake> 044 aircraft in one conflict
<fluttercry> 05,15Ni! Ni!
<Sundaysmile> brutal...
<Dken2021> mario world was the best mario game imo
<Phase4> Argh!
<Drake> 04She'll probably rack up a lot more kills over her career
<MahBoi777> ^
*Ictiv hugs fluttercry to make her into Fluttersmile and also for warmth apperently.
<Futttershy_is_dovaki> :'(
<Armageddon> yeah
<Egrus> This is a castle... but it's not Roy's one.
<Noir> Oh thank goodness, i nearly thought it was Mario is Missing. that game was a lame excuse of edutament.
<PONI> Mario 3D land WAS bad..
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm A GUY!
<Armageddon> I'll say 4-5
<Monkey_Zombie> less than an hour left.
<Armageddon> 6 if we must
<Mr_Blue> Anyone wanna watch all that with me?
<XaviortheSavior> 64 is best mario game imo
<fluttercry> 05,15ARRRRRGH
<Plotbuster> blacker than the blackest black times infinity
<Drake> 04Also I'm sorry but most of this inspiration is coming from Ace Combat
<Mr_Blue> Ya know, from da 90s
<Kenrick55> Blargh!
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> Well
<Armageddon> normally the Nighthawk would lurk behind
<Drake> 04"Demons/Ghosts of Razgriz," "Demon Lord of the Round Table,"
<Phase4> its hard to tell, what with text only irc and your name starting with 'flutter'
<Amras0000> well, this guy doesn't seem overly talented
<Polydunami> I kinda prefer SMB3
<Egrus> I liked 3DS :(
<Armageddon> XD
<Scootaloo> have fun sleeping tonight http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/129882
<Drake> 04also AERIAL JOUSTING
<Cabooselololol> i prefer the orignal SMB
<Drake> 04Gotta have that
<Armageddon> and Rhy will go ahead and blast whoever is in the way to smithereens
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04maybe with a nemesis you get
<Ictiv> Don't blame me for having the mental image of a very sad yellow filly with pink mane sitting quietly in the corner
<PONI> Mario Kart 7 was great, but where did quickrace go?
<Cabooselololol> yeah, i wanted quickrace
<Phase4> i blame you for giving me that image Ictiv
<Jay911> awesome percussion on the guitar....
<Ictiv> Anyway, have and Epic Man Hug
<Dens-Arrn> anything from ponibooru immediately perks my interest lol
<Drake> 04Like, during the conflict in which you get your nickname, you kill a friend of an ace pilot.

<Flluttershy> Caps lock on |:

<Lucid> What time is the Mane6t rooms going to open?
<Drake> 04And when they enter the airport/leave the plan they pull out weapons and try to take hostages, the mercenaries posing as hostile troops from another country
<_L1pE_BR> I think I should play gta online and shoot some heads to distract me from the lack of sleep
<Armageddon> well technically they can override it with authority
<Skyblaze> does anyone still use dial up
<PONI> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmZ2a8sCzz4

<Scratch> And Trixie is ther.
<pony43932> why is everything with ponies in it so awesome?!
<Dken2021> because...
<Kenrick55> g4 scootaloo is better than g3.5 scootaloo
<Hazard3> pony43932: everything is made for ponys
<Jay911> Pinkie: "The earth is round, silly!"
<Skyblaze> pony43932 everytihng
<Noir> Huh? if eny thing, Eminem would summon Discord.
<Drake> 04The mission is intended to mislead, and while they take hostages Rhy and Nathan (somehow) avoid being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
<insanity> Because ponies are awesome?
<Lucid> Bronystate regulars is best channel

<PONI> Anyway, remember Gilda and when she made fluttershy cry? She's still alive. Let's fix that.....

<MahBoi777> Let the vase kick

<Dramel> young discord looks awesome~
<MacDerpy> shed.mov is not spoken about either
<fluttercry> 05,15no TOMi this is the mane chat
<KiDtehEPiC> sup superbrony.
<Drake> 04Which is why he thinks that gunning down the kids, even though they weren't actually trying to fight back, is a bot cold even for him.
<deathpigeon> ...Wouldn't he be better suited for Hellfire rather than Heaven's Light?
<insanitydash> I'm gonna be in that corner over there --> and be sad.
<Phase4> nope, dont work
<Yixion> NOO BUFFERING
<Buytoast> There is a hellfire version
<Polydunami> Discord is not a good guy
<Drake> 04He convinces his CO to let them take them
<Sparkledash> WOW HE SINGS AWESOME :O
<Lucid> That should totally be on a Seapony Valentine
<Hazard3> this vid is amazing
<RainbowDash48> ikr

<Cypresswolf> No one for valentine's day? What about family & friends?
<Mr_Blue> I love how the fans want discord to have some kind of dark and troubled past where he used to be a good guy. But then was turned dark. When in reality he's just a sick and twisted manifestation of chaos that enjoys mentally breaking ponies for his own amusement.

<Drake> 04brb
<Kammerjunk> Please tell me I'm not the only one who heard Ashleigh there.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02As of right now, we have opened up the Mane6 Pony rooms to be used for chatting, which you can join by refreshing the page.
<Starflash> Of course not Kammer XD
<Starflash> pretty obvious~
<Kammerjunk> Oh, good. I wasn't sure whether it was in my head or on the stream.
<Dken2021> ah, a good episode to begin the marathon
<SuperBrony64> 10,02(Hmm...Hearthswarming Eve...indeed a good episode)
<Shizuka> 13or, if you're on a normal client, you can join #rainbow_dash, #twilight_sparkle, #fluttershy, #pinkie_pie, #applejack, or #rarity
<Kammerjunk> I often hear Ashleigh, Tabitha and Tara's voices in my head.
<Dken2021> and it seems the main channel will close soon
<Phase4> side rooms are open
<Armageddon> blah sorry Drake
<Armageddon> mum came home
<Starflash> Eeeyup
<Ictiv> Can't believe no one noted that Pinkie seeing the future is canon
<Dken2021> .... I don't think I want to go in those rooms
<Dken2021> isn't rarity the room used less?
<Kammerjunk> More Ashleigh.
<Starflash> AJ I guess.
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> Ohai
<Starflash> Kammerjunk naw this is RD...nvm
<Kammerjunk> Do ho ho.
<Altair> guys
<Altair> <3
<Starflash> autotune.
<Dken2021> well, time to take a shower then
<Kammerjunk> Was I the only one who heard "Furry and friends"?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02From now up until after the new episode stream, the main #bronystate chat will remain muted. Please choose one of the Mane6 rooms for chatting.
<Starflash> autotuned fuggibles =w=
<Lucid> bucking Jar-jar
<Dken2021> furbies needs to make a return
<Luna> 07,01this room will stay muted the entire event.
<Dken2021> for the lulz
<Starflash> kabwooey
<Ictiv> Even announcer is shocked Jar Jar stayed in after all those edits
<Kammerjunk> Jar-jar almost ruined the film to me.
<Phase4> furbies were fun but they were a little to silly
<Armageddon> ALTAIR
*Armageddon hugs
<Ictiv> Wildly Whacky...
<Ictiv> He aint Gene Wilder
<Starflash> Mane6 is muted? hmm.
<Starflash> Mane room*
<Starflash> why?
<Lucid> I'M ABOUT TO BE BRILLIANT
<Dken2021> no they will be open in a few min
<fluttercry> 05,15because
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: He might be Depp, but he will never be better than Gene Wilder.
<Dken2021> oh ,yes main room is closed
<Kammerjunk> Oh, Derpy.
<Kammerjunk> You are so random!
<Starflash> because? o.o
<Starflash> dat reason
<Phase4> poor fluttershy
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: Depends on the role though
<Dken2021> main room is closed to lessen the hassle on the ops
<Kammerjunk> Yeah.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02We hope you enjoy the event! Have fun!
<Kammerjunk> I can't see Wilder as Jack Sparrow.
<Ictiv> Yeah
<Ictiv> stepping onto the dock in that establishing scene of Black Pearl
<Ictiv> Not exactly a Gene Wilder moment
<Kammerjunk> Not quite.
<Ictiv> But I also can't imagine Depp with a goat
<Starflash> that scene always seemed rushed to me <_<
<Kammerjunk> Also, that magic-pulling Pinkie moment makes perfect sense to me.
<Ictiv> Give a sign if you know where that was from :D
<Phase4> i'ma run an experiment, i'l broadcast http://derpy.me/bronystatescript in the mane6 rooms and see how many clicks i get
<Kammerjunk> I haven't watched much Wilder.
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: don't spam
<Shizuka> 13you've posted that enough tonight
<Ictiv> :|
<Phase4> Shizuka: not spam, just once per room. wondering how many will click
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and i'm late
<Shizuka> 13you've been doing that all night
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hi everyone!

<Kammerjunk> Phase4: I approve of your browser support, or lack thereof.
<Starflash> Phase4... go to bed plax
<Kammerjunk> "Get a better browser" Do ho ho
<Ictiv> Quick question: Did the vote take place yesterday?
<Phase4> Shizuka: one last time ?
<Ictiv> Because I saw the update on Google Docs but newsletter said it will be today
<Lucid> Princess Platnium is best princess. Besides Luna of course
<Kammerjunk> I'm partial to Starswirl in this re-enactment.

<Phase4> Neigh, it was the unicorns!
<ArcherJoe11> just click play
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: Unicorns would never do such a thing!
<Ictiv> Phase4: I imagined you in a full on 18th century british admiral get up yelling that as if you'd say "Reload the Cannons!"

<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: I do bots. In fact, I have made love to this machine!
<Phase4> Shizuka: never used it for more than that. it was a short experiment i did some months ago
<Kammerjunk> And now, upon retrospect, I ask 'why?'

<Armageddon> and it's hard for me
<Altair> of course we're typically fucked up when not doing school work

<Starflash> Phase4 I love that one.
<Starflash> for some reason, that was one of my favs 10 years ago
<Kammerjunk> Rescuebots: Because we need to make more money off of Transformers.
<Phase4> rescue bots. not at all related to transformers
<Lucid> Hey look, Transformers clones
<Armageddon> too often
<Ictiv> Um...
<Phase4> Starflash: its meh now i think back to it but its ok for kids
<Armageddon> fuck, every time I see you you're either high or drunk
<Ictiv> I think they are part of the Transformers Franchise
<Drake> 04^
<Kammerjunk> That still makes my statement valid.
<Starflash> I'd not watch it again, rly. Ruins the memories
<Phase4> breaks mine though
<Altair> nah
<Kammerjunk> Yes, Ictiv.
<Altair> i'm typically both :D
<Kammerjunk> It is part of Transformers.
<Kammerjunk> It's even called "Transformers: Rescue Bots".
<Phase4> i would have thought soo, but they didnt mention it in the ad
<Armageddon> that too
<Starflash> rabblerabblerabble <.<
<Kammerjunk> No, I just Google'd it.
<Armageddon> Oh yes
<Armageddon> Altair, meet culex
<Armageddon> culex, meet Altair
<Armageddon> you can be fuckbuddies
<culex> Pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Altair.
<Drake> 04>fuckbuddies
<Drake> 04>#True-Flame
<Drake> 04Good lord how long has it been
<Altair> y hello there, mr. culex
<Kammerjunk> I think Twilight squee'd with joy when she found out she'd be playing a character whose mentor was Starswirl the Bearded-
<Phase4> quiet in here
<Phase4> Kammerjunk: probably
<Altair> shit half of the log got cut off ><
<Phase4> being ponies they can actualy make a squee noise
<Armageddon> ._.
<Armageddon> no one said anything don't worry
<Kammerjunk> Lucky them.
<Kammerjunk> I wish I could squee.
<Armageddon> also run /znc *admin set keepbuffer $me true or /znc loadmod admin first
<Starflash> You can squee :3
<Starflash> you gotta practice a bit though
<Dken2021> oh and I miss my favorite episode, curse you shower!
<Armageddon> Anyway, Drake, still, being young while they're training is fine
<Drake> 04I don't like it.
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> So, that's two different ways Ponyville was founded?
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: I think what the show didn't let us see was Twilight Nerd all over the face about Magic history facts
<Kammerjunk> I'd watch that,.
<Ictiv> all over the place
<Starflash> GabeMoist this is founding of Equestria, not Ponyville~
<Ictiv> not sure how i typed face
<Kammerjunk> Oh, wait.
<Kammerjunk> I read it wrong.
<Kammerjunk> Now I look like a dirty old bastard.
<Drake> 04I'd much rather prefer them being at least mid-teens the whole thing
<Drake> 04Because 12 is just far too young.
<Drake> 04Even 13
<Kammerjunk> I thought you meant Twilight spew out magic history facts.
<Starflash> Kammer... nah nevermind
<Dken2021> dat special somepony
<Altair> i got the logback, i'm just tripping out.
*Altair poofs
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: Yes. She listed a lot of facts
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> Starflash, so where did the Earth Ponies live?
<Ictiv> Now you made me wonder what ever else could you be thinking of and welll...
*Starflash coughs Moria
<Ictiv> You are a dirty, dirty filly
<Kammerjunk> I didn't read what I thought I read!
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> diggy diggy hole?
<Ictiv> [SWAG]GabeMoist: Yes and singing epic dwarven songs
<Kammerjunk> Twitchy twitcha twitch-a-twitch!
<Dken2021> say it with me, 1, 2, 3 ...LALI-HO!
<Starflash> Earth ponies are dwarves o.o
<Starflash> Lali-hoof
<Ictiv> indeed
<Kammerjunk> Starflash: I knew that.
<Ictiv> well miner ponies
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> it is now head canon
*Ictiv is trying to remeber the song from the start of The Hobbit where dwarves sung of the old days of The Loney Mountain
<Kammerjunk> Starflash: Three Rings for the Unicorn-kings under the sky, "Seven for the Earth-ponies in their farms of stone," Nine for Peagi, blessed to fly, One for the Dark Queen on her Dark Throne.
<Kammerjunk> So yeah. Earth-ponies = Dwarves.
<Armageddon> alright seeya
<Starflash> Yup
<Armageddon> fine
<Meanwhile> Hey everypony.
<Armageddon> 15 then
<Starflash> Ohai Meanwhile
<Kammerjunk> Hi, Meanwhile.
<Dken2021> lali-ho Meanwhile
<Drake> 0414 and a half is alright
<Drake> 04because the year needed for training
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: Nightly throne perhaps?
<Starflash> and then, gandalf was a unicorn o.o
<Ictiv> Or shadowy
<Ictiv> Oh no
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: Sure, why not. I'm not artsy in the least.
<Meanwhile> Have you guys seen the most recent episode blurb?
<Ictiv> Gandalf is an angel
<Ictiv> so technically he can be anything
<Kammerjunk> Gandalf is an Alicorn.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohh shi another crazy twi ep?
<Phase4> so much pony
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also hi Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Twi recieves a message from herself from the FUTURE
<Phase4> hai Meanwhile and TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> hi everypony
<Kammerjunk> Shut up.
<Kammerjunk> Spoilers are permaban.
<Phase4> and [SWAG]DisplasedAcorn
<Dken2021> I'm already liking the new twi episode
<Meanwhile> That's not a spoiler .-.
<Meanwhile> It's the blurb.
<Phase4> Meanwhile: i read the blurb :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that count as spoiler ?
<Phase4> it will be an awesome episode
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> Ohai Acorn
<Kammerjunk> Warnings have been given for that, IIRC.
<Meanwhile> It's rather hard to spoil something that hasn't been publicly seen yet.
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> hey gabe
<Kammerjunk> I don't know.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i mean it's posted on eqd
<Ictiv> Hm... Kammerjunk Three to the Unicorn Lords in their forts, Five to the Earth Ponies, working all day long, Nine to the Pegasi blessed with flight and one to the Night Queen on her Black Throne
<Phase4> http://derpy.me/HCe9C heres the cover image from eqd, not a spoiler
<Meanwhile> SuperBrony64. I request your attention briefly.
<Kammerjunk> People were pretty mad when book 5 of Harry Potter was released.
<Dken2021> we kinda are already spoiled the last episode with the new alicorn, so.... yeah
<Lucid> Kammerjunk, why? Book 5 was the best book
<Armageddon> yeah
<Ictiv> Book 5 was... The umbridge on I remeber but...
<Ictiv> What was the title?
<Armageddon> well
<Kammerjunk> Lucid: Because Snape kills Dumbledore.
<Armageddon> they should be 16 when they're ready
<Kammerjunk> And that was spoiled.
<Lucid> That was book 6
<Phase4> book 5?
<Kammerjunk> Same difference, I never read any of them through.
<Meanwhile> 5 was Order of the Phoenix
<Phase4> that was order of the pheonix
<Ictiv> Yeah that was 6
<Ictiv> oh right
<Ictiv> Phoenix
<Phase4> 6 is half blood prince
<Drake> 04Right
<Phase4> thx Ictiv
*Phase4 spell bad
<Lucid> It was kind of obvious that Dumbledor was gonna die
<Drake> 04Then they hit 17 and 18 over the course of the story
<Kammerjunk> Lucid: But not to people standing in line to buy the book.
<Phase4> the last one was called....
<Armageddon> yeah
<Ictiv> "Sparrow of Death sat upon my Dumbledoor"
<Meanwhile> Deathly Hallows.
<Phase4> what was it again
<Phase4> thx
<Ictiv> Raven*
<Armageddon> and Leo hits 21 or 23?
<Phase4> that was a good read
*Ictiv facepalms.
<Starflash> Ictiv dat raven.
<Lucid> Hmm, speaking of spoilers. I should read the book of the next Twilight movie, and when the movie premieres, spoil ALL the things
<Drake> 0423, so he's older than us and more of a mentor
<Meanwhile> I have it, and I know I read it, but I don't remember it like, at all.
<Ictiv> Lucid: Better idea, go to Twilight.wikia.com
<Dken2021> I thought thw twilight books were done with breaking dawn
<Phase4> wait
<Lucid> I didn't even know there was a Twilight Wiki
<Phase4> their making more twilight books?
<Ictiv> Dken2021: Yeah but it was broken into two parts in the movie
<Phase4> ohai [SWAG]GabeMoist
<Dken2021> it's the internet, there's wikis of everything
<Ictiv> Lucid: There is a wiki for everything
<Lucid> This is true
<Kammerjunk> Did YouTube plan this?
<Ictiv> For some things there is multiple
<Lucid> Youtube, it planned this
<Ictiv> for example the Elder Scrolls has at least 5 separate wikis
<Phase4> i blame SaxyPretender
<Ictiv> one of them not on wikia though but at uesp.net
<Dken2021> if youtube did plan this, then why take down episodes?
<Meanwhile> Which was not helpful at all when I was trying to find things.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14mfw I got pinged XD
<Kammerjunk> I swear, if we don't see the Last Roundup in the fan favourite mareathon, I will be shocked.
<Phase4> (thats my new way of saying hi to sxy)
<Kammerjunk> SaxyPretender.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh hai everyone
<Phase4> hai
<Meanwhile> Hey SaxyPretender.
<Dken2021> lali0ho SaxyPretender
<Starflash> Dat SaxyPretender :)
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> its so wierd to be awake this early and not on my way to work
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hi SaxyPretender
<Kammerjunk> These commercials are oatmeal.
<Starflash> Saxy Y U NO % in here
<Lucid> DAMMIT LORAX, GO AWAY
<Ictiv> SaxyPretender: Wanna join my Jazz jig?
<Meanwhile> He speaks for the trees.
<Phase4> ultraviolet?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14sadly, I haven't played sax in years
<Armageddon> Yeah
<Dken2021> oh look, the original, now let's see how much it compares to the new movie
<Phase4> i hate those 'digital copies'
<Armageddon> so he's 20 when he first finds us
<Phase4> this is before the 'it requires windows moie player' thing
<Phase4> movie'
<Meanwhile> Oh wow it's only 11:45.
<Meanwhile> I was asleep for like, 5 hours .-.
<Dken2021> ^same
<Ictiv> Whatswawuggla?
<Kammerjunk> WugglePets have NOTHING to do with Build-a-Bear at all.
<Kammerjunk> And were in no way inspired by it.
<Drake> 04yeah
<Kammerjunk> Or, rather, "inspired".
<Phase4> !cd
<ChanServ> Episode 17 of season 2 "Hearts and Hooves Day" airs in 0 days, 3 hours, 46 minutes, 59 seconds (Feb 11 2012 15:30:00 GMT)
<Dken2021> aren't build a bears expensive as hell?
<Kammerjunk> SOON
<Phase4> they should rename ChanServ in this room
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> I'm hungry...
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: Damn you Kammerjunk! Don't correct yourself before I could correct you for you
<Meanwhile> I'm Meanwhile. How's it going.
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: You cannot correct me! I am incorretibable!
<Kammerjunk> ...incorrectibable*
<Kammerjunk> I can't even spell words wrong right.
<Meanwhile> Incorrectable.
<Kammerjunk> I like incorrectibable, myself.
<Meanwhile> Though incorrectibable sounds better.
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: You should have typed incorrecti-babel
<Kammerjunk> I should?
<Ictiv> hidden refferences and all that
<Kammerjunk> Yeah. "Hidden."
<Meanwhile> How does her horn fit in that hat?
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> For Science!
<Ictiv> Swneaky
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Magic.
<Kammerjunk> You really should know this.
<Ictiv> It's bigger on the inside
<Meanwhile> I know I know.
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: Twilight is a Time Lord.
<Ictiv> She probably got it from Doctor Whooves
<Phase4> tardis bush
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> Not the Bees!
<Meanwhile> Conclusive knowledge from one observation, you're a bad scientist Twi.
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> AAAAAAAAAAAA
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: You've read about new episode?
<Kammerjunk> No.
<Ictiv> okay then
*Ictiv zips mouth.
<Dken2021> ah nick cage, we only remenber you from that movie
<Ictiv> Dken2021: That movie as in every movie?
<Phase4> poor twi
<Meanwhile> Beeeeeees
<Dken2021> sure, why not?
<Ictiv> Bees, my god...
<Starflash> Derp'd like a baws
<Meanwhile> Oh Derpy, you so silly.
<Phase4> derpy spam is probably happening in the mane6
<Lucid> When I contracted vampirism in Skyrim, I ran around screaming "I'M A VAMPIRE, I'M A VAMPIRE" Because Nick Cage
<Kammerjunk> That does not compute.
<Ictiv> Let me correct that: NOOO! BEESMAN! LIVE DAMN YOU! Damn... Beesman was a good soldier! He'll be avenged... Bees... My god
<Meanwhile> I can't play Skyrim seriously since I got the maximum level block perk.
<Meanwhile> I just sprint shield ram into everything and it goes flying.
<fluttercry> 05,15Phase4 you were correct. something about derpy gets people excited
<Phase4> on the plus side it makes her super easy to find
<Kammerjunk> That's because Derpy should derpy derp.
<Meanwhile> Derp da derp da derpity derp derp.
<Ictiv> fluttercry: Her curie mark is thought to be a few bubbles. But technically it is the molecular structure of the red matter that creates black holes
<Kammerjunk> wat
<fluttercry> 05,15woah
<Ictiv> So he draws our attention
<Ictiv> she*
<Ictiv> or he
<Phase4> that explains so much
<Dken2021> oh the days when she was the pony waldo, good times
<Ictiv> I'm not sure anymore
<Kammerjunk> fluttercry: MFW Pinkie said 'woah' right after you.
<Meanwhile> That's some mighty fine logic.
<Kammerjunk> Bah, can't be bothered to find a face.
<Ictiv> Voice Actress did think she was a male so...
*Ictiv rubs forhead.
<Ictiv> Pony Science
<Lucid> FDWAGGY BODDOM BAWG
<Meanwhile> True, but only because she was never informed otherwise.
<Kammerjunk> But I'll do it anyway. http://grahamkozak.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/whoa.jpg
<Lucid> I love making fun of AJ's accent, dunno why
<Lucid> Flutter relief
<Dken2021> whoa
<Meanwhile> I got 5 hours of sleep and this explains why. http://i.imgur.com/afxiG.png
<Phase4> Lucid: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-ah-aint-got-no-ack-cent.html
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: You should regret nothing.
*Phase4 has read to much fanfiction
<Meanwhile> And I don't <3
<Meanwhile> I'm more suprised that I woke up this early than anything else.
<Drake> 04NS
<Drake> 04What city should the climax be set in?
<Ictiv> Doozy always reminds me of "(Someone) and Tucker vs Evil"
<Lucid> Meanwhile, another Lorax commercial
<Armageddon> no idea?
<Drake> 04I'm thinking that, at first, Japan, China, Russia and the US are all against each other
<Armageddon> don't forget Korea
<Phase4> whats this?
<Armageddon> :{D
<Drake> 04but by the time the climax rolls around Russia and the US have teamed up
<Phase4> a new ad
<Drake> 04hmm
<Drake> 04true
<Kammerjunk> Great.
<Kammerjunk> Now we have bedroom eye'd blankets.
<Drake> 04Korea and Chine?
<Kammerjunk> For children.
<Drake> 04China
<Lucid> oh GAWD, it's horrible. And I though Stompeez were bad
<Kammerjunk> That's not at all creepy.
<Phase4> looks like the mane6 are not sure how to respond
<Drake> 04Actually I'm thinking that Korea just pisses everyone off
<Dken2021> marketers have no idea how to market for children
*[SWAG]GabeMoist wants pony stompeez
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: For -ever alone- Children
<Kammerjunk> YFW the child didb't control that dog.
<Kammerjunk> didn't*
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> i want to burn one
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> My swag would go off the charts with them
<Phase4> i liked this movie
<Meanwhile> Fry up is best brunch.
<Phase4> aparently people think it was bad but i lik eit
<Drake> 04China, Japan, Australia, Indonesia
<Phase4> like it*
<Drake> 04With Russia, US and Britain on the other side
<Kammerjunk> Leftover pizza is best breakfast.
<Dken2021> johnney depp movie was ok
<Ictiv> Phase4: It deifently wasn't bad... But it would have been infinitely better with a Singing wonka
<Ictiv> Come with me...
<Ictiv> And you'll be...
<Kammerjunk> NO
<Kammerjunk> D:
<Ictiv> In a world of Pure Imagination...
<Phase4> i honestly prefer it to the 60s one, charlie was a jerk in that
<Phase4> but the singing was good
<Ictiv> Oh alright Kammerjunk
*Kammerjunk hums Pure Imagination.
<Kammerjunk> Thank you for that.
<Ictiv> Phase4: Charlie was a real kid in that
<Meanwhile> I prefer world of pure inebriation tbh.
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: Let me fix that
<Kammerjunk> If you truly wish to be...
<Ictiv> Times have changed...
<Armageddon> lolol Indonesia
<Ictiv> And we've often rewound the clock!
<Ictiv> Since our Twilight has got the shock, when Rainbow Crashed on her top!
<Armageddon> Isn't Australia allied with the US?
<Kammerjunk> :why:
<Phase4> lol
<Ictiv> If todaaaay... Any shock they would try to stern
<Armageddon> Australia sucks up to them remember
<Drake> 04Yeah, but we're constantly relying more and more on China and Japan
<Ictiv> 'stead of crashing on Twilight's top, Rainbow'd simply "jump" on her!
<Drake> 04I can see us siding with them rather than the US 30 or 40 years from now
<Meanwhile> Is that a song or just nonsensicals?
<Ictiv> In olden days mere sight of ponies was looked on as quite ominous but now all knows: MLP goes
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Ponification of Anything Goes.
<Kammerjunk> By Cole Porter.
<Ictiv> Meanwhile: Cole Porter^
<Ictiv> Yeha
<Meanwhile> Never heard of him.
*Ictiv continues.
*Ictiv stops.
*Ictiv slaps Meanwhile.
<Ictiv> Youtube.
<Ictiv> Now
*Ictiv clears throat and continues.
<Meanwhile> But, but...pony D:
<Kammerjunk> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as-whCYL4ns Here's somepony singing Porter's song.
<Phase4> i think the reactions to this episode were a little out of proportion
<Kammerjunk> Well, not "somepony" as such, but Ella Fitzgerals.
<Ictiv> Bad salesmen too who once sold Hasbro's stock, now get to make money off of Lauren Faust!
<Kammerjunk> Fitzgerald*
<Ictiv> They deserve oust!%
<Lucid> Seriously, I don't really see the religious connotations
<Meanwhile> I see how it can be interpreted as such.
<Ictiv> If Rainbow's fast tricks you like, if Spike's mustache you like, if Sun Gods you like, if Galas you like, if Big Mac you like or Smarty-Pants you like, well nopony will oppose!
<Phase4> and now i know how to pronounce 'plymoth'
<Meanwhile> But my response is my same response to all religious topics. I really don't care.
<Phase4> level up
<Ictiv> When Ev'ry nigth, newer bronies are intruding on pinkie parties in web-chatrooms...
<Ictiv> A new day blooms!
<Phase4> the difference betwene relegion and pinkie is pinkie is stasticaly significant
*Starflash is happy.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and way more fun
<Phase4> prayers to results cant be seperated from chance
<Meanwhile> Yeah, for a start, Pinkie makes sense.
<Starflash> squee
<Meanwhile> dohoho.
<Drake> 04Plus, we're far more multi-cultural than the US or Britain, and we're more in the Asia-Pacific region than anywhere near our old allies.
<Drake> 04New Zealand would probably follow us
<Meanwhile> Troll face disengaged, continue.
<Lucid> The difference is that Pinkie sense can be measured and observed in real-time
<Ictiv> When Rarity (Celestia bless her) can get fgrown old met to love her, then i suppose: Anything goes
<Kammerjunk> MFW I'm listening to the song now.
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> HONK
<Phase4> pinkie knew
<Ictiv> When Sethisto the Great can hoard enough, fandom to not just run but flourish a sight: It shines a new light!
<Phase4> Stream! Y U SPOILER
<Ictiv> The world has gone mad today, and bad's good today, and black's white today, and Day's night today, and the bro today, you gave a hoof today, Once could have loathed you!
<Phase4> :P
<Phase4> this is the second time i've seen this today
<Meanwhile> One does not simply write a checklist.
<Ictiv> When K-kat and his collegues, just cannot stop to expand on the show's lore, Bronies just glow
<Meanwhile> One does however, simply eat fried mushrooms.
<Ictiv> Hm...
<Ictiv> No that was off
<Ictiv> Can't rember how I wrote it :(
<Kammerjunk> Are you just makign this up as you go along?
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Ictiv> remember
<Dken2021> and then it's desync'd
<Kammerjunk> Dken2021: Refresh stream at commercials.
<Dken2021> oh it's veemi? that's odd
<Ictiv> Is it me, or did we see an 80s style commercial just a moment ago?
<Kammerjunk> So sweet and tasty~
<Phase4> alot of commercials are 80's style
<Phase4> dont look like theyve been changed since being made
<Armageddon> perhaps, Drake
<Saturn> 08,01afternoon all
<Saturn> 08,01oh yeah, mute

<Kammerjunk> Fair enough.
<Drake> 04Think about it

<Ictiv> Suddenly Doctor Whooves x Twilight Sparkle Shipping

<Meanwhile> That's even worse!
<Kammerjunk> Wait... Did Twilight just hoof stomp as we would beat one fist into our other hand's palm in frustration?
<Dken2021> Luna when you see this many ads, you just learn to live with it
<Ictiv> Meanwhile: Indeed?

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> asblock to the rescue
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ad*
<Kammerjunk> I'd make a comment about how news on the web reminds me of a certain something not getting media attention, but I don't want to start a discussion.
<Phase4> no, tell us sb
<Ictiv> SuperBrony64: Quick question: Did the lottery take place already,
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> what upsets you the most?

<Ictiv> Grats anyway :)
<Armageddon> Well true, Drake
<Luna> 07,01Bunti aur Babli is ;)
<Armageddon> but assuming that all passed
<Armageddon> We both know that Australia loves sucking up to the US and probably won't stop anytime soon
<Meanwhile> And what on earth is that?
<Drake> 04I dunno
<Drake> 04With Julia Gillard out of the way...
*Drake run
<Drake> 04s
<Luna> 07,01that's the Beeee movie ;)

<Ictiv> Luna: Did you see Danny Kaye movies?
*Phase4 is unsure but will give bollywood a chance
<Dken2021> I've been to an india food mart that had a wall full of bollywood movies
<Armageddon> it's China, Australia, NZ, Korea etc. against US, Russia and Britain
<Drake> 04Instead of these craptards like John Howard, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard
<Luna> 07,01^
<Armageddon> I think Japan would side with China
<Drake> 04yeah
<Dken2021> probably should've picked one
<Drake> 04Japan -> Australia -> China
<Armageddon> since >Japan and US
<Luna> 07,01eeyup

<Kammerjunk> INB4 boom.
<Armageddon> Hey
<LordCelestia> 0,5Vacant room is vacant
<Armageddon> I actually didn't mind Kevin Rudd
<Meanwhile> I don't trust bollywood movies since I saw Indian Superman, but I trust Luna enough to give it a look.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 SHHHHHH
<Ictiv> Luna: I have no problem with watching Bollywood movies but more importantly: Did you see any Danny Kaye movies?
<Armageddon> let's have Whitlam back
<Armageddon> actually he'll be dead by then

<LordCelestia> 0,5Oh I was
<Armageddon> yeah
<Kammerjunk> I knew it!
<Kammerjunk> But, well, the Sun is the same in a relative way.
<Kammerjunk> But you're older.
<Ictiv> Extreme multi tasking: Writing, being in a chat room, watching MLP and Watching Doctor Who at same time.
<Armageddon> Drake anyway
<Kammerjunk> Human multi-tasking is a myth.
<Armageddon> beginning
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> i just noticed spike and twilight are the same shade of purple

<Armageddon> sleep etc.
<Drake> 04first we need to fly back to the Aussie HQ
<Ictiv> Yes I am
<Ictiv> maybe not down the the smalles piece of measurable time
<Kammerjunk> You're focusing on writing stuff while chatting in a chatroom and watching two shows.
<Dken2021> yay multi tasking, I was in pit in marching band, had accessories
<Ictiv> but my attention is swapping with such speed i'm pretty much doing them at smae time
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Please don't talk in #BronyState while it is muted for the stream unless it is something important like an official announcement.
<Luna> 07,01yesss more ads!
<Drake> 04Then the CO of the Aussie section basically says to us and the few other kids that we either work for them or die.
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: I know right?
<LordCelestia> 0,5FOREVER
<Meanwhile> Because everyone needs more ads.
<Meanwhile> An endless cycle of ads
<Meanwhile> Forever.
<Ictiv> I feel like the sever from "The Parting of Ways"
<Ictiv> server*
<Drake> 04and then training
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: Because you know what they say. Severe interference is shown when even very time tasks are performed at the same time.
<Drake> 04NS, will we be stationed in Australia for our off-duty segments or somewhere else?
<Kammerjunk> when even very simple*

<Dken2021> it's been awhile since I seen party of one
<Phase4> 's list
<StinkomanFan> I'm not good with Star Trek canon
<Ictiv> ... Too much?
<Ictiv> oh
<StinkomanFan> could youy explain the joke to me?
<Dken2021> I really didn't like lat roundup
<Ictiv> StinkomanFan: Vulcans have this thing every 7 years
<Kammerjunk> Actually, I really, really like Nightmare night too.
<Ictiv> where uh...
<Ictiv> They well...
<Ictiv> Um...
<Kammerjunk> We'll be rah' back t' the We Heart Ponies mareathon.
<Ictiv> Well when a lady vulcan and a man vulcan feel very idifferent about eachother

<Kammerjunk> Dken2021: Oh Goddesses, that song.
<StinkomanFan> Oh so they sex weirdly
<LordCelestia> 0,5I am Ronald. Give me your children.
<Ictiv> A horny gig... I aways hear that
<Kammerjunk> I swear, if you can't get Ronald McDonald to sing Ran Ran Ru at this Ronald-gram, it's not worth it.
<Dken2021> the only ronald I will think of is the japanese one
<StinkomanFan> The Lorax made me cry
<Ictiv> Dken2021: You mean, Bow Chicka Bow WoW,
<Ictiv> ?*
<LordCelestia> 0,5Hey now
<Ictiv> Excuse me... um Lady Ronald?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Enough sexual talk
<StinkomanFan> What was the other 4 episodes?
<Lucid> I hate the Lorax. I mean, it's an okay movie I guess, but it reminds me way too much of my AP Earth Science class
<Ictiv> What talk? Bow Chicka is a legendary bow Wielded by the Elven hunter Elenamos
<Ictiv> And it was a Bow that Wowed everyone who beholded it in their sight
<Ictiv> thus the phrase
<Kammerjunk> Dashie was embarrassed because it happened in front of Applejack.
<Kammerjunk> You all saw it.
<StinkomanFan> Rarity's a silly pony
<Phase4> has matrix aired on bronystate?
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: Yup. Her rival
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: Not according to the backlog.
<StinkomanFan> ...in bed :3
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: ^
<Phase4> great! new a movie choice
<LordCelestia> 0,5I think we only said like, two things. :/
<StinkomanFan> Twilight is abusive Librarian
<Saturn> 08,01boing
<Big_Jakeintosh> gooooooooood morning everyone how goes it?
<Dken2021> morning Big_Jakeintosh
<StinkomanFan> saturn you aren't a mod here
<Kammerjunk> Two's company.
<StinkomanFan> Stop using color
<Kammerjunk> Three's a party.
<Ictiv> StinkomanFan: Neither is Shizuka
<Saturn> isn't this an official bronystate channel?
<Kammerjunk> Yes.
<Kammerjunk> But ChanServ is a silly filly.
<Ictiv> Saturn: Exactly
<Ictiv> So put that yellow back on
<Saturn> 08,01in that case, i'm allowed to use colour
<Ictiv> or rather: Put on a clour Saturn actually wears
<Ictiv> colour*
<LordCelestia> 0,5Yep, Saturn
<LordCelestia> 0,5As of about 2 months ago, this chanel is official :3
<Ictiv> And about 1 and a half ago, since I don't always forget to join here, this is also officiall a silly channel
<Ictiv> Fiddlesticks
<Starflash> Give Saturn his + already :<
<Saturn> 08,01woo
<Kammerjunk> Starflash: He did.
<Starflash> yay
<Kammerjunk> Aat 13:40:49.
<Kammerjunk> GMT +1.
<Phase4> shiny new router is good! i got 15MB/s of bandwidth. running 1376x[something] vnc session with bandwidth to spare
<Kammerjunk> Time zones are so easy to forget.
<Lucid> Dat 612
<Starflash> Kammerjunk, are you considerate or are you euro?
<Starflash> judging by kammer, euro
<Phase4> 23:41 here
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: You have 15 MB per second?
<Lucid> Also, that chick is pretty cute. Just sayin'
<StinkomanFan> Why don't mods have there own channel so they don't have to screw with us?
<Phase4> Kammerjunk: wifi, not internet
<StinkomanFan> ...That came out wrong
<Phase4> wish i had that much internet
<DWR_Shower> StinkomanFan but thats the best part of them being a mod!
<Phase4> lol StinkomanFan
<Kammerjunk> I thought MB/s meant megabytes per second and Mbps meant megabit per second.
<Kammerjunk> Starflash: Danish, so euro.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02It's okay, just a reminder since it isn't fair for us to talk in there while other viewers can't.
<Saturn> 08,01StinkomanFan: we do
<Phase4> Kammerjunk: megabytes, its 120 megabits a second
<Saturn> 08,01several, in fact
<Kammerjunk> Dude, wow.
<StinkomanFan> D:
<Kammerjunk> Why do you have that much?
<Kammerjunk> I only have 50 Mbps.
<Phase4> i use that much
<StinkomanFan> They're horrifying
<Kammerjunk> And it's not like I ever use 50 Mbps.
<Phase4> plus its running on 5ghz instead of 2.4, so i get that even when the microwave is on
<Ictiv> Fun fact, even with 120 Mbps, a Dalek couldn't dowload all of the internet in 5 seconds
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> Saturn is my favorite cuddleuppit
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: I hope that's not after series 4 of the new show.
<StinkomanFan> SoDoctor Whooves is safe?
<Big_Jakeintosh> wow 120 mbps I only got 3 mb/s
<Phase4> just to make sure i've not said this wrong, its 120megabits/s wireless. my internet connection is only 16mbit/s
<Meanwhile> Who was it who said "spock the drogon" like, ten minutes ago?
<Kammerjunk> I don't use wireless anymore because walls are annoying.
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: 1 I actually like Matt Smith
<StinkomanFan> I said it
<Big_Jakeintosh> Phase4: still more than i got i hate living in the middle of nowhere
<Ictiv> 2 that is from Series 1 of new show
<Ictiv> episode... 4 I think?
<Meanwhile> Well StinkomanFan this is for you then. http://i.imgur.com/UooHK.jpg
<Ictiv> Title: Dalek
<Kammerjunk> I don't watch much 9th Doctor.
<StinkomanFan> :D
<Phase4> Big_Jakeintosh: problem is i'm not in the middle of nowhere. aussies get screwed in terms of internet
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: How about old ones?
<StinkomanFan> Dalek is worst pony
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: Series 1, EP 4 is Aliens of London.
<Phase4> but the new router allso got native ipv6 ^_^
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: Okay, then another one
<Kammerjunk> I've watched very little of the old show. It's so LONG.
<Phase4> and i'm on the one provider in aus that suports it
<Ictiv> the one that plays in 2012
<Lucid> Because IPv6 is really all that useful
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: And it's also great
<Meanwhile> My photoshop ability needs work.
<Kammerjunk> Oh, right!
<Kammerjunk> That episode!
<Ictiv> especially 4th doctor <3
<Ictiv> I want dat scarf
<Kammerjunk> I completely forgot about that episode.
<Phase4> Lucid: it is, or at least will be when people start to impliment it
<Kammerjunk> It's 6, BTW.
<Ictiv> not much off then
<Ictiv> also: Are you my mummy?
<Kammerjunk> I want my mummy.
<Meanwhile> That episode was creepy.
<Ictiv> mummy?
<Ictiv> That episode was awesome
<Ictiv> Just like my mummy
<Meanwhile> Not as creepy as weeping angels, but sstill.
<Kammerjunk> I like the shoutout to that episode in The Poison Sky in series 4.
<Ictiv> My Little Mummy: Jack Harkness is Magic
<Meanwhile> Jack Harkness IS magic.
<Phase4> the reason i need the fast internet is file transfers, i would run an ethernet cable but people keep tripping over them
<Big_Jakeintosh> why is it some of my favorite episodes involve ponies going nuts
<Lucid> Dat construction
<Phase4> wireless', not internet. *derp*
<Ictiv> Meanwhile: Indeed
<Kammerjunk> Jack Harkness is sexy.
<Ictiv> Meanwhile: Also: That's what dem lady folks did say
<Kammerjunk> But not as sexy as Tennant.
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<Kammerjunk> Secrets and lies!
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: Tennant isn't sexy. Tennant is Swaxy
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/UooHK.jpg Nice spread.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Did you just make that?
<Meanwhile> I did actually, but it took me like ten minutes.
<DWR_Shower> Meanwhile Lolwut..
<Kammerjunk> Manually cutting the head off?
<Meanwhile> Yeah, I'm not exactly photoshop savvy.
<Kammerjunk> Neither am I.
<Kammerjunk> I just use it to make Rainbow Dash salute in front of the Danish flag so I can hang posters up at school.
<Kammerjunk> Stuff is fun.
<Meanwhile> I'm keeping that picture in my fav bar.
<Kammerjunk> What'sawuggle?
<Meanwhile> That is apparently.
<Kammerjunk> And it's totally not a Build-a-Bear ripoff.
<Meanwhile> Overlook the fact that until you add stuffing it's a skinned animal.
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<Phase4> my brain is yelling at me
<Phase4> "go to sleep. go to sleep."
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: Tell it to shut up when you're watching pony.
<Lucid> Just sayin, but Pinkimena looks better then Pinkie Pie.
<Kammerjunk> We don't have Black History Month over here.
<Meanwhile> I love Pinkie Pie, but I do like Pinkamena's look.
<Kammerjunk> We don't feel like we really need it.
<Kammerjunk> Pinkamena is terrifying.
<Meanwhile> I know, dreamy isn't she.
<Lucid> Kammerjunk, where do you live, because I want to move there
<Kammerjunk> And schizophrenic.
<Kammerjunk> Lucid: I don't think you do.
<Kammerjunk> But Denmark.
<Meanwhile> Best face.
<Phase4> Gah
<Phase4> still wierds me out
<Lucid> Well, it's probably better then here
<Meanwhile> I love her crazy face.
<Phase4> has anyone here read 'shipping and handeling'?
<Phase4> derpy fanfic?
<Ictiv> Lucid: "Here" wouldn't happen to be Hungary, would it?
<Lucid> No, I live in 'Merica.
<Meanwhile> I need to visit Hungary sometime.
<Ictiv> You don't
<Meanwhile> I do.
<Ictiv> you really don't Meanwhile
<Kammerjunk> Pinkamena: "They're coming to take me away, ha ha, to the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time and I'll be happy to see those nice young mares in their clean white coats and they're coming to take me away, ha ha!"
<Meanwhile> I really do.
<Ictiv> Meanwhile: Okay... NEVER to the capital
<EpicStatsGuy> <@Sneas> You can get electrocuted while fucking a robot <~Altair> shocking <~Armageddon> HAHA Altair <~Altair> oh god <~Altair> my own pun burns my eyes
<Meanwhile> Budapest? spelling optional.
<Ictiv> you spelled it right
<Phase4> party invitation, the hard way
<Kammerjunk> Is it just me, or is Pinkie a litte... grey?
<Ictiv> Now you know what trains/planes not to get on
<Phase4> Kammerjunk: i recon this was planned
<Meanwhile> Half my ancestry stems from Hungary, I need to at least visit.
<Kammerjunk> Also, don't take any planes to Denmark.
<Ictiv> Meanwhile: Visit the country. Not the cities.
<Kammerjunk> We're slowly ruining the country.
<Kammerjunk> Oh, wait.
<Kammerjunk> That's called a government.
<Ictiv> People are relatively nice in the country
<Phase4> inb4 3d cake
<Phase4> there it is
<Kammerjunk> And no more grey.
<Kammerjunk> THEY KNEW
<Ictiv> In a city you're going to get robbed blind by ligmate businesses as soon as they realize you're a tourist
<Meanwhile> Dat bucket of turnips.
<Ictiv> legimate*
<Phase4> perhaps the greying thing is part of being the elements of haromny?
<Phase4> harmony'
<Ictiv> Phase4: Or losing one's self
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: Yes, but this was way before S2.
<Meanwhile> I've been to Jamaica, they try to rob you literally when they know you're a tourist.
<Kammerjunk> Also, Big Mac was greyed out in S2.
<Phase4> Kammerjunk: i know, and discord was planned pre pilot
<Kammerjunk> Exactly! FAUST KNEW!
<Phase4> the thing you are watching is allso coming up next
<Phase4> neat, find a pet
<Kammerjunk> What if Faust planned this entire show to attract adult men all along?
<Phase4> no... may the best pet win?
<Phase4> whats this one called?
<Meanwhile> Same thing.
<Phase4> Kammerjunk: thats kinda true
<Phase4> its for kids and their parrents
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: It's called May the Best Pet Win, but ponies could guess it anyway.
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: Yeah.

<Kammerjunk> Everypony sing along to the duet!
<Ictiv> Anyone looking for a pre episode review? :D
<Phase4> Ictiv: NO
<Meanwhile> I only sing the song of the dragonborn. And only because shouting can counting as singing in that instance.
<Ictiv> okay...
<Kammerjunk> ...Cannot unhear "horny gig".
<Kammerjunk> So thanks for that.
<Kammerjunk> "We touch a lot of things throughout the day."
<Kammerjunk> he he he
<Lucid> I wonder if the Dovahshy episode will be on the list
<Phase4> 4/5 kids recomend clorox
<Ictiv> Phase4: I'm also very happy for them, and I'mma let them finish but Louis Armstrong and Ella Fritzgerald had the best duet of all time. Of all time!
<Kammerjunk> Oh, no.
<Kammerjunk> Is that the Rock?
<Kammerjunk> It's not, is it?
<Meanwhile> Probably.
<Kammerjunk> Good Goddesses.
<Lucid> It is
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: Feels like you're between a Rock and a hard place
*Ictiv twists mustache.
<Kammerjunk> Do ho ho.

<Meanwhile> Same person.
<Meanwhile> Sadly.
<Big_Jakeintosh> lol i know
<Meanwhile> Then don't say silly things.
<Ictiv> Hold on...
<Kammerjunk> It's easier to call him the Rock.
<Kammerjunk> Also, BRB. mIRC hates my guts.

<Big_Jakeintosh> what episodes have been on so far?
<Ictiv> uh?
