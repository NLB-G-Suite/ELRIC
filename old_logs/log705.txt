<Jmo> Aren't you a cool kid.
<XAX> Jmo: you comment on literally everything I say.
<Jmo> :>
<Vivix> Hehe, yeah, I try to keep it at 6-7, I don't know all the why's and such, but QI and others have said 6-7 is the golden medium-
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Hello DerpyMuffins
<Socks> Hey DerpyMuffins
<DerpyMuffins> Phase4 playing minecraft again?
<RaveBrony> Mhhm

<TheRandomkid321> if I got to sleep at 10:30pm and wake up a 7am I have 7 hours and 30 min right?
<Socks> Vivix, not wise to trust everything QI says though, they have recieved criticism for inaccuaracy before (most of which has been rectified by QI though)
<Vivix> True, alot of what they say are "teeechnically" or "Kiiindaa" or sometimes even "not really"
<Vivix> but, that one seems to have been repeated elsewhere as well
<TheRandomkid321> what is QI?
<Phase4> all the lags
<Vivix> English show about interesting facts
<Comfortabler> hello
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Comfortabler
<Vivix> sometimes downright wrong (Frequency vs pitch) and sometimes just technically right, but usually funny
<Comfortabler> hello AdamTheDuck
<Socks> QI is awesome don't get me wrong, but you should fact check it. :)
<Vivix> Agreed, totally
<Socks> If anypony hasn't seen QI, fix that!
<MadSurge> Awww I didn't get to say goodnight to Sumica :(
<RaveBrony> :(
<TheRandomkid321> Phase4 I got some more music for ya. One song though.
<Vivix> QI is a lot of fun, especially the XL, where you get that extra bit of silly things from the guests
<Phase4> theres a bunch of stuff happening here
<MadSurge> Hello Phase4 :)
<Socks> I don't get why they don't just make XL the normal show. :/
<Phase4> might have to stop streaming
<AdamTheDuck> I might actually head off to sleep early tonight

<XAX> Phase4: I'd run it for you if my net weren't atrocious.
<TheRandomkid321> Phase4. yes your IP worked... Now I am going to have to resist one of the greatest temptations ever.
<XAX> My machine is alright. I could probably play with you while running it. But my net is 3rd world-tier.
<Phase4> TheRandomkid321, :<
<TheRandomkid321> Phase4 Can I just test if it will work?
<XAX> TheRandomkid321: We get it. You have his server ip. But we've moved on from minecraft for now.

<Sylandest> morning, everypony :)
<valoreins> ohai Sylandest its evening here though :)
<Sylandest> ahh, howdy, valoreins! :) And is it? Then good evening! hehe
<valoreins> :D
<Phase4> urgh
<Phase4> this is anoying
<Phase4> theres an apache2.4 package in the exeprimental repo
<Phase4> but i can't install it
<Sylandest> so what do?
<Phase4> how bizare
<valoreins> oh btw Sylandest what do you think about this? http://i.imgur.com/M5k15.jpg
<Sylandest> valoreins: that looks marvelous! I can't wait to see the finished product!
<valoreins> thanks... but, the problem i dont feel like continuing this..
<valoreins> is*
<Sylandest> valoreins: oh? why not?
<valoreins> some people in my group complaints about celestia's heavy armor lol
<Sylandest> valoreins: it only gives the appearance of being heavy armor, doesn't mean it necessarily is, lol
<Sylandest> valoreins: which part brings the most objection from them?
<Eli> heyo. I'm back :)
<valoreins> the shoulder, i really need to rethink of a new design
<Eli> damn military
<Sylandest> wb, Eli
<valoreins> ohai Eli
<Sylandest> valoreins: not necessarily. I like what you did with Luna's shoulder design, so maybe we can think of something akin to that, but still significant and different for Celestia?
<Eli> hi. seems like the military liked me more then i like them :P
<The_Engineer> Hi everybody :)
<Eli> hi The_Engineer
<valoreins> ohai The_Engineer
<Sylandest> valoreins: the idea that came to my mind was to maybe change the texture that you have Celestia's shoulder armor done up as. It seems rigid, while Luna's is more loose. Maybe you could revise it that way?
<The_Engineer> Whose streaming?
<Eli> who's streamin?
<The_Engineer> xD
<valoreins> yea it's the texture, her shoulder is actually not finished texturing yet
<Phase4> stupid debian
<Sylandest> valoreins: well, then you still have room to finish! Don't go knocking a good artwork when its not even done yet! :P
<Phase4> Eli, The_Engineer: i am
<The_Engineer> Phase4 ;D
<Eli> thought so Phase4
<Eli> Phase4: what's the music? sounds damn interesting
<the_real_pony_1604> what is Phase4 trying to do?
<valoreins> i know.. but i already lose my drawing "spirit"... sucks to be me so easily depressed
<Dark_Horst> valoreins: just came back here. wat textures?
*Sylandest hugs valoreins
<Phase4> the_real_pony_1604, install apache 2.4 on a debian system
<The_Engineer> phase
<Phase4> its proving dificult
*valoreins hugs Sylandest back
<Sylandest> valoreins: then we'll just have to poke it back into action! hehe.
<Phase4> The_Engineer, yeah?
<The_Engineer> <3
<The_Engineer> i wub you
*Phase4 hugs The_Engineer
*The_Engineer hugs Phase4 back
<The_Engineer> I'm eating cookies with tea ;3
<valoreins> alright, i think its not good being depresed so easily
<The_Engineer> wait...thats wrong I wanted milk...
<Eli> what's the music Phase4? I really wanna know :(
*Sylandest ruffles valoreins' mane
<The_Engineer> Valoreins is a PONY?
<Phase4> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL_zhGHP4o0&feature=autoplay&list=UUmMWwYyeQlZzbeynRJwCSGg&playnext=5
<valoreins> :$
<Sylandest> valoreins: then we'll keep your spirits up! You've no reason to quit just yet, mister! OR miss. whatever you may be.
<valoreins> kay, thanks for the encouragement
<Eli> Phase4: pony musicians??? fuck they are GOOD!
<Phase4> :)
<JRP> Phase4: i be on le youtube
<Sylandest> valoreins: :) I'm sure if you keep at it, it'll turn out wonderful. Just take into account what folk say so you can edit it before you finish. Believe me, it looks great! You've no reason to give up on it!
<Phase4> damn
<Phase4> i could use the experimental package
<Phase4> but that'd require a dist-upgrade to sid
<Lyra|inbed> no shsuh
<valoreins> alright, think it's time for me to be busy~
<The_Engineer> Phase4 what browser you using? looks like MozFox
<Phase4> The_Engineer, nightly
<Sylandest> valoreins|Drawing: thats the spirit! :)
<Phase4> its the unstable build of firefox
<The_Engineer> nightly?
<The_Engineer> unstable?
<Phase4> its built once every night
<JRP> Phase4: make the internet go boom
<The_Engineer> Whats the difference between unstable and stable?
<Phase4> JRP, i'd rather not
<Phase4> i've got stuff stored there
<Phase4> The_Engineer, ones prone to exploding
<JRP> Phase4: i found your facebook
*The_Engineer says in a twilight voice:
<The_Engineer> I don't get it
<Phase4> i'm using it cause its aparently the only way to get 64 bit firefox
<Phase4> for windows anyway, linux and mac have had 64bit for years
<The_Engineer> Oh ok
<The_Engineer> so watcha doin in there/
<The_Engineer> i mean the site
<JRP> There's a shoe in my snake
<The_Engineer> So kicked in the dick?
<the_real_pony_1604> he is trying to install some software into an odd ball OS
<the_real_pony_1604> and not having much luck
<Phase4> "Frankly, a yellow box is a bit optimistic"
<The_Engineer> mmk
<Phase4> the_real_pony_1604, its hardly odd ball
<the_real_pony_1604> hahaha
<JRP> Phase4: make it go bookm
<Phase4> debian servers are the most popular servers out there
<The_Engineer> Oh god
<The_Engineer> aghhh
<The_Engineer> Too much cookies. Now I feel sick
<Phase4> The_Engineer, with reason, its great, i'm doing wierd stuff hence the broken
<Phase4> The_Engineer, eat so much cookie the sickness rolls over and becomes health
<The_Engineer> i ate 12
<The_Engineer> ;3
<Phase4> only 12?
<Phase4> sissy
<The_Engineer> D:
<RaveBrony> :o
<JRP> Phase4: There's a shoe in my snake.
<the_real_pony_1604> oreo, or the 5lb chocolate chip?
<The_Engineer> Chocolate chops
<Phase4> i love chocolate chip cookies
<Phase4> theres a few spesific brands here that are really nice
<the_real_pony_1604> snickerdoodle, my fav
<The_Engineer> i like the blue cookie box
<Phase4> should make my own at some point
<The_Engineer> I dont remember its name though
<Phase4> The_Engineer, its either debian or ubuntu servers
<The_Engineer> Its a blue box with cookies on it and its brand name. i ate it as a child
<The_Engineer> XED
<Phase4> but they're very similar opperating systems
<The_Engineer> Wrong persoN?
<Phase4> to th epoint that they share packages
<The_Engineer> Phase4 were you meant to message me?
<Phase4> derp
<Phase4> the_real_pony_1604, i ment you
<Phase4> and the mesages before also
<Phase4> derp
<Phase4> needs sleep
<The_Engineer> Phase4
<the_real_pony_1604> I would believe ubuntu, we have 4 flavors of that at work. no debain
<The_Engineer> i'm getting a double cream oreo and eating it with ma tea

<the_real_pony_1604> what are you trying to build? I thought I saw tekkit there
<Phase4> the_real_pony_1604, my tekkit server is on the same machine, i want apache 2.4 on debian but don't want to build my own package
<The_Engineer> Phase4 you going away now cause you stopped streaming
<Phase4> seems that to get that though i'd need to upgrade to sid and i'd rather not
<Phase4> The_Engineer, yeah, sleep, ineed sm
<Phase4> some'
<Phase4> brains giiving out
<the_real_pony_1604> interesting..... I wish you luck with that sir!
<JRP> night all
<Phase4> the_real_pony_1604, its not actually 2.4 that i want, its the mod_proxy improvments. mod_fastcgi is a terrible stupid broken thing and 2.4 fixes that
<the_real_pony_1604> haha, nice.
<JRP> fuck this nick
<JRP2234> much better
<Phase4> the_real_pony_1604, srsly though, try configure php-fpm with apache 2.2, its imposible to make it work like mod_php
<MadSurge> That's weird, the first episode they aired for the FiM italian dub was the Canterlot Wedding O_o
<JRP2234> phase bed
<the_real_pony_1604> no thanks, my computer building skills stops at windows. but if you want me to build the hardware for your server thats a different thing. ;)

<Jmo> Domo~
<MadSurge> YAAAY Flutterwonder :$
<Coldays> Yay
<MadSurge> Yaaaaay~
<Coldays> :[ you shall win this
<artist> hey guys
<Coldays> hi artist
<artist> i saw something scary searching for this site on google
<Kammerjunk> Google gonna google.
<MadSurge> Yaaaaaay~
<Frenchy_pony> the search on google are differents depending of your location
<MadSurge> Domo: who's your favorite pony?
<Coldays> indeed yaaaaaaaay
<MadSurge> YES
<Kammerjunk> U.N. Owen was best pony.
<artist> i typed equestria, and the first thing that showed up was "equestria after dark" ._.
<Coldays> bring da pain
<Jmo> Ahahaha
<artist> all i was ever looking for was equestria DAILY
<Frenchy_pony> artist you might have a "history record" for google ^^
<Kammerjunk> Google does use your search history. Its greatest asset is also a curse.
<artist> ive never searched for something like that before.....
<artist> + im using inkognito
<Frenchy_pony> so it's a curse
<Kammerjunk> I'm fairly certain Google hasn't considered ponies.
<MadSurge> :D
<Kammerjunk> artist: Your search history, not your browser history.
<artist> not my pc >_>
<artist> Kammerjunk: never searched it
<Kammerjunk> Again, it's hardly a perfect system.
<Kammerjunk> Joke's on Google, though. I'm blocking trackers.
<Kammerjunk> She can put target to God, she gobble gay!
<artist> other than google thinking im a clopper, whats up?
<Kammerjunk> Here's a little secret: The Earth is round. THERE IS NO UP OR DOWN
<Frenchy_pony> And to conclude, what do you found search for Osu ? (my curiosity is killing me)
<Kammerjunk> Frenchy_pony: Rhythm is just a click away.
<artist> yupp
<Nerom> Comes on stream and random gangdamstyle... Awesome
<artist> eyupp
<Kammerjunk> Suddenly, Alex S.
<artist> i dont want to do my homework......why does my teachers hate me?!
<Kammerjunk> Oh right, I only have one math assignment this week.
<artist> luckyyyyy
<Kammerjunk> I can't remember the Rule of Cosines, though. Oh well, Google.
<artist> when is halloween?
<Kammerjunk> The 30th, I think.
<Kammerjunk> I dunno, I don't celebrate it.
<Domo> dat pinkamena
<Domo> and 31st
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<artist> i wish i could submit my art here......to bad is suck at drawing
<Kammerjunk> As far as I can recall, pictures were never banned during streams.
<artist> oh, i mean for the halloween thingy
<Kammerjunk> Oh. I can't draw worth my life.
<MadSurge> WHAT THE HELL
<Kammerjunk> Yes, MadSurge?
<MadSurge> Italian Sailor Moon theme? :D
<Nerom> Them bananas
<Kammerjunk> I 'unno, I cannot Italian.
<Kammerjunk> It's more different from Latin than I'd like.
<Wrek> 05oo ponies are in levels gaming mag
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: I can and IT IS :D
<Wrek> 05picture inc
<Hoody|Skool> Sup suckas?
<artist> MadSurge: i wish i could do italian, its sounds awesome
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: not sure which season though
<Domo> I need more music...=w=;
<MadSurge> :D
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, me too.
<Coldays> dont we all
<Kammerjunk> I have, what, 17 GB? Not enough, at any rate.
<Hoody|Skool> ^
<Hoody|Skool> dammit Kam
<Kammerjunk> Ha ha,
<Kammerjunk> goddammitcommakey
<Hoody|Skool> ;~;
<ASoftFluffyThing> What's goin' on?
<Kammerjunk> What isn't?
<Jmo> Lots of stuff.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ohai Domo
<Hoody|Skool> This brings new meaning to the word "Fruitbowl"
<Kammerjunk> I really like fruit.
<Hoody|Skool> ^
<Wrek> 05http://notharam.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/wpid-1351002945482.jpg?w=640
<Kammerjunk> Speaking of which, I might have some apples downstairs.
<Wrek> 05there we go
<Coldays> 100
<MadSurge> Lil_B: really? .__.
<Kammerjunk> Lil_B: Still, it's one small step for a mare.
<Hoody|Skool> I think i'm the only person who actually did something for crazy hair day at my school...
<Kammerjunk> Crazy hair day? Is that a thing?
<Dragonmatte> Osu! :D
<Hoody|Skool> Kammerjunk: Yep
<Wrek> 05was still fun to see it in the article
<Kammerjunk> Because my hair is approximately 1½ cm.
<Wrek> 05cant escape ponies
<Lil_B> MadSurge yes, the speaker said they don't trust aall of us to behave kids friendly :P
<Coldays> sesure worthy
<Nerom> Brony for life wrek even if you slip away for some time
<Hoody|Skool> I spiked my hair and covered it in silleh string
<Kammerjunk> Lil_B: Unreasonable is what it is. The Internet houses the most trustworthy people I can think of.
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I understand no gore, but you can just ban people with obscenities as cutie marks
<Lil_B> MadSurge actually, Saturn was also there, he asked "Will the Game have Plot"
<MadSurge> Lil_B: OF COURSE IT WILL
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: But not before they're made, lest you want a character-approval system.
<Kammerjunk> The game will have a large selection of hats, it appears.
<Kammerjunk> Speaking of hats, I hope they keep the hat-tower bug in the game.
<Kammerjunk> That was fun.
<Lil_B> MadSurge I don't think you can ban every guy with a bad Cute-Mark, escpecially when it has a lot of players
<Lil_B> oh yes! they mentioned the Hats!
<Hoody|Skool> You can't get on FB here... but I can get on tumblr?
<Lil_B> They said "We want to have atb least one more hat than TF2!"
<Kammerjunk> I still don't know how they'll support their servers if it's supposed to be free. Then again, many private MMO servers work on a donation-based system, and they get along.
<UncouthLurker> May i ask what was the previous song?
<Coldays> Viva la Vida by Coldplay
<Nerom> Did not heart that
<UncouthLurker> Sounded like a vocaloid song
<Kammerjunk> I hear Vocaloid is pretty good.
<UncouthLurker> Depends on who uses it.
<Kammerjunk> Kanye West?
<Coldays> yes Kanye Powers Activate
<Kammerjunk> Coldays: Good gracious, man. No one man should have all that power.
<Coldays> Power by Kanye West
<Kammerjunk> No one mare should have all that friendship.
<Nerom> what about the power of major west?
<Coldays> and yes i do belive i should have all dat power
<Domo> The song I just finished playing was Kyven's All Beginning
<Domo> and i hate this computer. freezing everything :I
<MadSurge> Aww :(
<Eli> *Poof* Coldays became a gay fish
<Hoody|Skool> thats a cold computer
<Lil_B> I hope Christmas will come soon, wanna buy WiiU, Kirbys 25 th anniversary Stuff and at least 2 Movies
<Kammerjunk> Eli: As long as he didn't become a Babel Fish.
<Kammerjunk> Hoody|Skool: o u
<UncouthLurker> Domo: I'm really interested in the song that played before that one
<Eli> Kammerjunk: what's a babel fish?
<Coldays> I dont have gills and i dislike Fishdicks in my mouth
<Hoody|Skool> Kammerjunk: :3
<Eli> oh taht was THE best song live :)
<Nerom> begin the bannana rain!
<MadSurge> Awwww yeah, Coldplay!
<Kammerjunk> Eli: Hitchhiker's Guide. Translates stuff when you stick it in you ear.
<Hoody|Skool> Exploding bananas
<Hoody|Skool> My god
<Kammerjunk> A wild sticky keys appears.

<Kammerjunk> Hey, bananas are good. I like bananas.
<Kammerjunk> Good source of potassium.
<Coldays> :O he be playin my request Yaaaaay!
<Eli> "I don't care what others say, I like coldplay. deal with it" -David Tennant
*Hoody|Skool flps onto Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Eli: Every time I read that, I can't help but imagine David with sunglasses.
<Kammerjunk> Hoody|Skool: wat
<Hoody|Skool> I meant to flip, but my finger slipped and I said flp
<Kammerjunk> Well, that was a flop.
<Coldays> so many bell's
<Hoody|Skool> I tried to flip, but i slipped and tripped, now i feel like a dip
<Eli> I think coldplay made my general gaming philosophy: just because i'm losing doesn't mean i'm lost :)
<Nerom> Them bells
<Eli> I've*
<Coldays> you've
<Hoody|Skool> Alright I gotta go. Latas people
<Coldays> Bye Hoody
<Kammerjunk> I think B.J. Thomas made my life philosophy: Cryin's not for me, 'cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'.

<SafariMonkey> Socks: I'm sorry to say that as I don't have a TV I only see shows that I find myself, and I only found it recently
<Coldays> what is Red Dwarf?
<SafariMonkey> Socks: I started on s3, I believe
<Dken2021> it's a sci-fi comedy
<Socks> SafariMonkey, That is a good series, the first 2 have a fond place in my heart
<Coldays> i like syfi and comedy
<Socks> All of the series are really good :)
<SafariMonkey> Socks: Because I was told that the earlier ones weren't a good starting point. Like starting Dr Who on S1 TOS, but to a lesser extent
<Coldays> then ill have to start frome the start. now where is the start?
<SafariMonkey> Socks: I'll be sure to watch them sometime
<Socks> The first 2 are good but the show changes drastically from S3 onwards, it's way more sitcom-y with s1 and s2
<SafariMonkey> Socks: As opposed to?
<Panda> Less than 3 weeks \:3/ wooooooo!
<Socks> Well it happens way more on the ship as opposed to s3 onwards when they run around in starbug a lot and go to places
<Panda> And then WallDives showed up, everyone hide...

<Coldays> hi Shizuka
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Shizu. :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy` just talk shit about ruby all day and it will make him angry.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> because he seems to be so caught up in a single useless language.
<MadSurge> Hello Shizuka! Help us make Canary less sad :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> also he needs ponies so it is required that you put ponies on his desk.
<Stormy`> XD
<MaxTheBrony> is Canary sad D:?
<Bronysith> i dont remember LadyCanary saying shes sad.. question mark?
<Kimori> If that professor found out she likes ponies shed have bigger problems
<AJIsAwesome> I don't think she wants to talk about it.
<WallDives> ^
<Stormy`> It would only confirm his strange idea that I have a horse obsession
<MaxTheBrony> allright.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> id ask him why he likes a language that doesn't scale.
<MaxTheBrony> understandable :)
<MaxTheBrony> Il hope she'll feel better :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> thats why twitter had tonnes of downtime when it was growing because its hard to scale ruby on rails.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Invi> hi Jmo

<MaxTheBrony> :)
<AJIsAwesome> I STILL need to watch that show. :D
<Coldays> me too
<Dken2021_> you should, it's awesoem
<Stormy`> I think he just jumped on it because it was the newest bandwagon a couple years ago or something
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> thats true
<Dken2021_> especially aaron paul
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> it was a fad, a big deal and people thought it was going to be the next biggest thing
<Bronysith> i love the main character
<Bronysith> he was in Malcolm in the Middle
<Kimori> and it wasnt right?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> twitter is even moving away from ruby on rails
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> because it is hard to scale and resource intensive.
<Stormy`> everything I'm hearing says it was only a fad and only the fanboys are clinging on to it
<Dken2021_> yea, which was surprising to me since he was so comical in that one
<Stormy`> such as my professor
<LunasGuard> I just got the internet explorer on my xbox :)
<Invi> lol I just found a Soul eater (anime) Lyra ^^
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> ruby on rails tries to be easy to use, but at the expense of using much more cpu to process shitty code.
<Dken2021_> LunasGuard is it as stable as the PC version?
<Stormy`> even when I'm running it locally it's sooo slow
<Stormy`> And I don't even find it easy to use
<Stormy`> I think all the conventions and crap are confusing
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I prefer messy php to slow ruby any day.
<LunasGuard> sadly u need flash for bronystate
<AJIsAwesome> You could use IRIS, too.
<Stormy`> it complains if you make a slight mistake in how it wants you to name something
<Coldays> i like Soul Eater its a good anime
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> at least php has a decade of support and stability behind it.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<MaxTheBrony> Its awesome :)
<MaxTheBrony> hilarious
<AJIsAwesome> Too bad the anime's over.
<MaxTheBrony> yeah :s
<Dken2021_> it doesn't come with flash? that's lame
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yep, they force naming conventions on you to make your code look beter
<Coldays> yea
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> better
<AJIsAwesome> The manga's still going on, just not the anime.
<MaxTheBrony> Anyone got any tips on simillar animes like Soul eater?
<TheOnlyPegacorn> what just happend?
<Bronysith> MaxTheBrony: you mean hot blooded anime?
<MaxTheBrony> yeah
<LunasGuard> Dken2021_: it seems to work really considering I have just a controller
<MaxTheBrony> Lots of fun shit and epic battles :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> what is the class for anyways? is it a web dev course?
<Bronysith> MaxTheBrony: check out gurren lagann
<Bronysith> MaxTheBrony: your blood will boil after watching gurren lagann
<MaxTheBrony> Bronysith: I will thanks :)
<MaxTheBrony> Oh its this :D
<MaxTheBrony> I saw like 5 episodes then i forgot then name
<MaxTheBrony> but its awesome!
<Coldays> ohh shiz Gurren Lagann
<Coldays> dat good show
<Dken2021_> yea, that one's ok, though I like the second half more
<MaxTheBrony> Oh you know any on going series?
<MaxTheBrony> I hate catching up and then its done :s
<AJIsAwesome> One Piece?
<Dken2021_> Bleach?
<TheOnlyPegacorn> HELL NO
<Bronysith> Bleach sucks
<LunasGuard> fairy tail
<Bronysith> BALLS
*Socks stabs Colday in the back as his way of saying he has returned
<Coldays> what i thought we were done with that
<Coldays> Dam you Socks
<Stormy`> it's "Systems Development"
<Socks> :P
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Stormy`> It didn't even have to be web; the professor just wanted to use rails
<MaxTheBrony> bleach is done isnt it?
<MaxTheBrony> They just ended like that..
<Jmo> nop
<taoumi> oh..... that project isn't due till the 28th.... well that's nice to know
<Bronysith> its dragon ball z with swords
<Socks> IS bleach done, if so It may be time for me to start watching it
<Dken2021_> oh they did finally?
<Socks> Bronysith, you say that like it's a bad thing!
<AJIsAwesome> It's not.
<taoumi> nope Socks it is not
<Jmo> You wish it was finished.
<Socks> Aww :(
<MaxTheBrony> its on break?
<Socks> I would prefer to watch a show that I know has an end
<Dken2021_> geez, bleach must be going for the record of longest running anime of all time
<taoumi> the manga is stil lchuging along at 512 Socks
<MaxTheBrony> epi 366
<MaxTheBrony> Oops

<Socks> SO R PANDAS!
<Panda> one piece is good
<MaxTheBrony> Im so picky :s
<Panda> though
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVE One Piece. :D
<Panda> it just very very boring
<Bronysith> meh
<taoumi> i gave up watching one piece. i read it now insted
<Bronysith> one piece has been going on way too long
<AJIsAwesome> Panda: I can understand that.
<Socks> One Piece is really good, I need to get back into it.
<MaxTheBrony> Anyone know a show that have the Animation quality equall to FMA: Brotherhood?
<AJIsAwesome> At least it has an ending planned out,
<AJIsAwesome> *.
<MaxTheBrony> Cause Fma:Bh had awesome animations
<Dken2021_> are they still searching for gold roger's treasure or they doing somethi9ng different
<Dken2021_> ?
<Panda> one piece is one of those things like bleach and naruto that need to just end and not get strung out... though im sure my gf would kill me for saying that >.>
<AJIsAwesome> I still need to finish FMA.
<Socks> ^ same
<Panda> AJIsAwesome FINISH NOW~! ITS SO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!
<AJIsAwesome> Panda: Yeah, I can understand.
<Bronysith> YOU HAVENT FINISHED FMA?!
<AJIsAwesome> Nope.
<LunasGuard> i stop watching one piece because i forgot were i left off at
<Socks> Neither have I
<MaxTheBrony> Fma is amazing!
<MaxTheBrony> Watch it
<Invi> Panda, your gf is a One Piece fanß ^^
<MaxTheBrony> Love the Intro also!

<MaxTheBrony> Yui- Again , best intro song Imo
<Bronysith> friggin naruto
<LunasGuard> i still dont know were i left off at
<Panda> AJIsAwesome. make sure you watch brotherhood and not the origional...
<LunasGuard> :P
<LunAnonymous> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 17 days, 20 hours, 21 minutes, 11 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
<AJIsAwesome> ?
<AJIsAwesome> Why not?
<Invi> Panda, lol are they already off the fishmen island? ^^
<AJIsAwesome> Invi: Yeah, I think so.
<Panda> Invi i stopped after the fight with the CP9 and the introduction of the big 10
<Bronysith> my god people
<AJIsAwesome> I'm still on the Sabaody arc, myself.
<Panda> or what ever they are called
<Dken2021_> naruto wasn't that bad.....well then again, I left off when they when sasuke's brother was introduced
<Bronysith> stop doing the cd shit, season 3 will get here sooner than you think
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Socks> I'm on the one where they meet god... I think :P
<MaxTheBrony> On what anime?
<MaxTheBrony> fma?
<AJIsAwesome> I would've loved it if they kept the characters young in Naruto.
<Invi> Panda, last thing i saw was how they went to the fishmen island ^^
<Socks> One piece
<AJIsAwesome> But I lost all interest in Naruto when Shippuden came out.
<MaxTheBrony> AJIsAwesome: I actually like seing the characters grow up :)
<taoumi> the only reason i watch naruto was for lee, and now that he has his own spinoff show there is no reason to watch or read naruto at all
<Invi> Socks, you mean enel?
<Dken2021_> AJIsAwesome did sakura ever get useful after the timeskip?
<Kandarihu> So you're up to episode 175? That's the oddly awkward part of One Piece, where the filler arc after this is going to be better than the actual canon arc you're watching now.
<Socks> Yes that's the bunny
<Invi> buny?
<Panda> AJIsAwesome, well for me... its just getting good, well where the manga is... it was very very boring before hand.
<AJIsAwesome> In fact, because they were kids it seemed pretty inspirational to see them become powerful and developed shinobi.
<Invi> *binny
<Invi> *bunny
<AJIsAwesome> Dken2021_: Yeah, she did.
<taoumi> wait Kandarihu whithc one was that. the dragon island arc?
<Kandarihu> taoumi, Skypiea
<Dark_Horst> naruto would be a good show... if the characters wouldnt use up 95% of the episode talking bullshit
<taoumi> skypiea is cannon Kandarihu
<Dark_Horst> they sut never shut up
<AJIsAwesome> I loved the Skypiea saga. :D
<Dken2021_> man, sakura was like the most useless character in that show
<Panda> ^
<Panda> still is
<MaxTheBrony> I love naruto for Kakashi xD
<AJIsAwesome> My favorite so far probably has to be the CP9 saga, though.
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<MaxTheBrony> wait
<Panda> MaxTheBrony oh hehe, well... you know what he did right?
<Panda> hahaha
<AJIsAwesome> Either that or Impel Down.
*LunasGuard love naruto for naruto
<MaxTheBrony> Panda: Yepp :D
<Kandarihu> taoumi, I know. And this is the part when it gets slow. It's because at this point in the manga, Oda was rewriting how a major plot point in the future plays out.
<Panda> MaxTheBrony O_O you read the new chapter?
<MaxTheBrony> Panda: Ofcourse >; D
<MaxTheBrony> I loved it
<MaxTheBrony> !
<Socks> I found it dragged, (ha one piece drag never) so I stopped watching on skypiea, intend to go back though
<Panda> MaxTheBrony... poor rin ;A;
<MaxTheBrony> Panda: yeah but why did kak do it? i didnt understand
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<DaringDerpy> good evening bronystate :)
<Dark_Horst> hey, knwo what would be cool right now? if a mod would heroicly crash into the chat and stream something

<MaxTheBrony> Panda: I didnt think of that xD
*Socks stabs DaringDerpy by way of greeting
<taoumi> but usualy Kandarihu whe none piece does a filler it's like or or maybe 2 episodes that are obviously not cannon in the least... liek saumari theater or something
<Invi> Dark_Horst, too bad they are aaklmost all working or at school or whatever mods do in their spare time :D
<Panda> MaxTheBrony eeyup... well there is other specualtion, but thats heresy.
*DaringDerpy stabs socks in the liver as friendly hello

*Jake gives Socks the /me achievment
<Socks> WOO!
<taoumi> ok going ot read my book today. and write the prigram tomarow
<Kandarihu> taoumi, up to the point where Socks got up to, the longest filler arc was 7.5 episodes long.
<Socks> :)
<Invi> I liked Oz
<taoumi> sign of a good anime Kandarihu *cough* naruto */cough*
<MaxTheBrony> Socks: You know if you Write first letters of a chatters name and press TABB you will automaticly write the whole name
<Socks> O.O woah! Science fiction!
<MaxTheBrony> yepp yepp
<Socks> Let me try that...
<Jake> Neato
<Kandarihu> Well, the filler after Skypiea is 11.5 episodes long, but like I said earlier, it outshines the canon stuff.
<MaxTheBrony> :D
*Socks stabs Coldays
<Coldays> NOOOOO
<Socks> WOW It works!
*MaxTheBrony Tackles Socks
<Bronysith> im already talking with my friend who cosplayed as lelouch and we are setting up arrangements for dragoncon next year :D

*Panda licks SB
<Invi> Brad_, featuring: Captain Americas shield
<CaptainAmerica> Coldays and chew bubblegum! and I'm all out of gum!
<Kandarihu> There's a 10 episode filler arc a while after that, but besides that, yes. The fillers are very sporadic. It's probably because the episodes are padded to fill out the full 21 minutes that they have.
<CaptainAmerica> Aha! I see my sheild in that picture!
<Coldays> ha no sheild no decapitation
*CaptainAmerica punches Coldays
<Jake> I only have a Sword

<Meanwhile> I suck at driving games at the best of times but first person seems abominable to use.
<Vordox> Wbat if we take this van and push it over THERE!
<DaringDerpy> this looks like fun
<Vordox> THIS IS BLOODY MAYHEM
<Meanwhile> It's not all that bloody so far.

<DaringDerpy> front motor cars need a slight kick in the rear
<Meanwhile> No not really.

<MadSurge> Kandarihu: experience and objectives...?
<LunasGuard> I WANNA EAT!
<Vordox> This NEEDS to be increased in VOLUME!
<Coldays> ROCK!
*Vordox cranks up the Volume
<Meanwhile> What's the objective if you've already cleared the objective?
<Vordox> So much METAL :D
<Coldays> literaly
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, her objective is to kill 38 cars, and she pulled it off.
<LunasGuard> Vordox: is that a pun
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: yeah, I see
<Vordox> LunasGuard: ...Derp XD
<Vordox> GO GO NO NO NO!
<Meanwhile> Everything else is just bonus points.

<Vordox> Coldays: now it's just for fun!
<Vordox> SHIZU WANNA ROCK!
<DaringDerpy> next challenge
*Vordox headbangs.
<Sylandest> so its safe to say Shizu gives no bucks?
<Coldays> lol agreed this looks like fun
<Vordox> Sylandest: She gives no heed for weak pansies.
<Vordox> <--- Proof

<MadSurge> Meanwhile: are you one of those that want no spoilers for season 3?
<Vordox> Rock ROCK I wanna ROCk rock rock rock I WANT TO ROCK!
<Sylandest> im certainly enjoying this
<Vordox> Bravo shizumobile !
<Chrysalis> MadSurge ALL s3 spoilers are bannable
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Don't really care. But it's not allowed in chat anyway.
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: not even in PMs?
*Vordox standing ovations.

<alexxm> hey guys and how are things Vordox
<Coldays> hi Alexxm
<Colt_Brovakiin> Ohai alexxm :)
<Vordox> alexxm: Having some AWeSOME fun in Burnout :D
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, Chrysalis, only if the recipient doesn't mind the spoilers. Keep in mind that this is still a spoiler sancutary.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, alexxm. :)
<LunasGuard> Meanwhile: look out raining metal
<alexxm> how've you guys been Coldays Colt_Brovakiin and AJIsAwesome
<DaringDerpy> hi alexxm :)
<Socks> Well, I think I'd better be heading bedwards...

<AJIsAwesome> BYe, Socks :)
*Socks stabs Coldays for old times sake
<Vordox> That classical music XD
<DaringDerpy> you?
<Socks> :)
<Kandarihu> I wouldn't suppose there's any way to cause the game to play custom music in this game, is there?
<Meanwhile> Quality's better than yesterday.
<Sylandest> I love how the van has a constant kickback, lol
<Coldays> Noo bye socks
<Socks> :P
<MadSurge> There, I'm done Chrysalis. And I've been very vague to Meanwhile :D
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Should be doable
<Meanwhile> Speed limit? what speed limit?
<MadSurge> ^
<Vordox> Meanwhile: with a van? What Van?
<DaringDerpy> this music fits
<MadSurge> THIS MUST BE GERMANY
<Coldays> the Vague has been dubbled
<Meanwhile> What are these 'rules of the road' you speak of?
<Kandarihu> I mean, if there was a way for Shizu to have her modplug music channeled into the game as she smashes up cars, that would be an oddly amazing juxtaposition there.
<DaringDerpy> MadSurge: has of the german autobahn has speed limits or construction sites....and careless driving gets punished everywhere...but yes...at night, when the traffic density is low...yay :)
<Coldays> dose she have to pay for gas
<DaringDerpy> -has +half
<Vordox> Weneed music, by EA
<MaxTheBrony> Bye guys :s gotta go do some french studying...
<Meanwhile> Au revóir.
<LunasGuard> buffer
<MadSurge> DaringDerpy: I know noone would drive like this IRL, but :D
<DaringDerpy> MaxTheBrony: wish you success
<LunasGuard> later MaxTheBrony
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, MaxTheBrony. :)
<Coldays> you like smashing other cars don't you Shizuka
<MadSurge> MaxTheBrony: Go learn fancy! :D
<LadyCanary> DAT JANE'S ADDICTION
<Vordox> Awww, the music isn't high enough. :(
<LadyCanary> <3
<Meanwhile> It's kind of the point of the game.
<MaxTheBrony> :) merci mes amis! Au Revóir!
<LadyCanary> STOP AND NOW GO.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: murder with cars?
<Meanwhile> Mm.
<Vordox> <3
<DaringDerpy> autobahn is best with a motorcycle
<Bronysith> my god breaking bad wtf
<Coldays> no murder just wrecking
<Bronysith> DaringDerpy: best way to die
<Vordox> Thank you Shizu
<DaringDerpy> if you want to take the risk, Bronysith
<Meanwhile> Bonk.
<twilight_sprinkle> lul
<Vordox> Smart AI is Smart
<twilight_sprinkle> le wild wall appeared
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<Bronysith> oh god breaking bad you are breaking my heart
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, GilDash. :)
<Meanwhile> 'Lo GilDash.
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi GilDash
<TheKoreanBrony1354> burnout
<Coldays> hi GilDash
<DaringDerpy> Bronysith: it's a honorless death, imo...you risk to involve other people, who just want to get home
<Colt_Brovakiin> Heya GilDash :)
<Kandarihu> Does anypony know why DJ Atomica is referring to Burnout Elite as a "noble order of drivers"?
<Invi> hai twilight_sprinkle
<MadSurge> GilDash! Hiiiii
<twilight_sprinkle> hei Invi :)
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: Because he's buzzed off his head?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> is this burnout paradise
<Coldays> hi Twilight_Sprinkle
<twilight_sprinkle> ohai Coldays
<shizumobile> Oh come on...
<Coldays> so many wrecks:D
<Meanwhile> That was unlucky.
<Bronysith> so many retards on the internet
<VenHur> Hello everypony! I loves tacos, and I am NOT a retard for once.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, VenHur. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> i am!
<Colt_Brovakiin> Heya VenHur :)
<Coldays> Hi VenHur
<Invi> hi VenHur
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi VenHur
<Meanwhile> Welp.
<DaringDerpy> hi VenHur
<alexxm> how are things VenHur
<Meanwhile> 'Lo VenHur.
<Coldays> i am too but dont use the R Word\
<shizumobile> Blaaaaaaaah
<GilDash> VenHur: Holla you non-retarded taco loving person!
<twilight_sprinkle> vertically!
<Meanwhile> Those railings are surprisingly robust.
<DaringDerpy> Shizuka: this vehicle has brakes too
<Meanwhile> Don't be silly, brakes are silly.
<VenHur> So, what're we watching?
<GilDash> Who uses breaks?
<Domo> What are breaks
<Meanwhile> Kitkats?
<GilDash> I prefer Twixes, but thanks anyway.
<DaringDerpy> good show tonight
<twilight_sprinkle> twix ftw
<Bronysith> kitkats are so delicious
<Bronysith> so crispy and chocoloatelyeafdioaduf
<Meanwhile> Is it buffering a lot all of a sudden or is it just me?
<Coldays> true who dose use breaks i just let whatever i crash into stop me
<AJIsAwesome> I never liked kitkats. :D
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: i see some buffer too
<AJIsAwesome> I get some occasional buffer.
<twilight_sprinkle> kitkats are good too, but they so blatalntly ripped of the break thing
<GilDash> But Twixes has that irristable layer of caramel...
*DaringDerpy can't find a speed meter
<Bronysith> but you cant compare twixes to kit kats
<Meanwhile> Guess the connections gotten fuzzy on one end.
<GilDash> Just did.
<DaringDerpy> this is at least 250 km/h...more to 300
<DaringDerpy> ouchie
<Coldays> both vans
<Vordox> <--. Women drivers. :P
<Bronysith> we need more death in chat
<Coldays> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> nah, this seems slower than 250 km/h
<Bronysith> Vordox: asian women drivers
<GilDash> I have this song somewhere...
<Vordox> Bronysith: You do know women drives not as fast as men ? :P
<Coldays> the LOL has been Dubbled
<Bronysith> Vordox: id rather deal with slow drivers than fast drivers
<Vordox> Shizu is ONE hell of a driver from the looks of it
*MadSurge likes an active chat
<Vordox> Reaction times like a god(ess)
<Domo> I (would) drive about 3 miles a hour
<Meanwhile> Vordox: You say that and boom, walled.
<DaringDerpy> bus ^^
<Vordox> Meanwhile: XD
<Meanwhile> Vordox: You're bad luck.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: walled?
<Domo> the road is scary >>
<Bronysith> hehe
<Vordox> JUST A COINCIDENCE
<shizumobile> Ack
<Bronysith> shizumobile: stop dieing
<Vordox> Bronysith: It's not death :
<Vordox> :P
<twilight_sprinkle> wow
<twilight_sprinkle> that was a neat death
<Meanwhile> These games always were good for car acrobatics.
<Vordox> HOOPPPPY SHIT
<twilight_sprinkle> like ragdoll only with cars
<Vordox> Shizu likes her jumps
<Cades> hey
<Coldays> she crash win
<Vordox> "YOU LOST scene " "You win" "Woot"
<DaringDerpy> great success!
<Bronysith> fucking junkies
<Bronysith> Breaking bad is too damn dark
<Vordox> XD
<Meanwhile> No one cares about Breaking Bad.
<Meanwhile> At all.
<Meanwhile> I don't even know what it is.
<DaringDerpy> breaking bad is a thing now?
<Meanwhile> Find a Breaking Bad chatroom if talking about it is that important.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: meth trade
<GilDash> Meanwhile: It's got Hal in it! ... And that's literally all I know. XD
<Coldays> ^
<Domo> Dat car <3
<Vordox> Breaking bad = Sounds like farts
<Blako> hi
<Kimori> hi Cades
<DaringDerpy> barrel rolls
<Vordox> OH SHIT
<Vordox> It's the MAYHEM ONE
<Vordox> Ah no it's not :P
<Meanwhile> And I thought the van was a bit speedy.
<Vordox> That insane target score...
<twilight_sprinkle> no chance
<GilDash> How the hell are you supposed to reach that?
<Meanwhile> Driving around a lot?
<Vordox> Give her time. =3
<twilight_sprinkle> with combosalotsa combos without dying
<shizumobile> Hate the stunt runs.....
<Meanwhile> Clonk.
<Coldays> fali
<twilight_sprinkle> ignore my horribru typing
<Vordox> She was only 70k away
<Coldays> i failed at spelling fail
<Dark_Horst> dat dj
<Kandarihu> Now I understand. Even though she clears the requirements for an event, it doesn't end until her time runs out. Sorry for not understanding before
<Meanwhile> I like that there are no pedestrians whatsoever.
<DaringDerpy> on the highway?
<Vordox> Kandarihu: So spoiled gamers :P
<Meanwhile> Anywhere.
<DaringDerpy> where I live, they get fined when there
<twilight_sprinkle> pedestrians in this game would make it carmageddon
<twilight_sprinkle> fun game btw
<Meanwhile> Presumably in the kind of society that lets drivers do this all over the main road everyone has just learned to stay indoors.
<Meanwhile> Courier services must be lucrative.
<DaringDerpy> censors would have a party on this game with pedestrians
<twilight_sprinkle> carmageddon actually got banned in many countries for the pedestrian splattering
<alexxm> and thats why most racing games have no pedristrians
<twilight_sprinkle> they had to replace pdestrians with zombies
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, everyone?
<twilight_sprinkle> cause zombies have no feelings
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: Mm. It's like if the world was comprised of the average person in this chat. :P
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, oh that's not very nice. lol
<Coldays> i like da way you think <Meanwhile
<GilDash> Surely someone would do something about a bright pink vehicle doing a rediculous amount of damage?
<SafariMonkey> oight alexxm?
<DaringDerpy> this society were full of complaints, politicians, lawyers and people shooting each other out of frustration
<alexxm> i'm good SafariMonkey you?
<SafariMonkey> good thanks alexxm
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, mentioned replacing the pedestrians with zombies in Carmageddon in order to get around the bans. What if all of these other cars are being DRIVEN by zombies?
<DaringDerpy> you have a bad perception of the people, Meanwhile
<SafariMonkey> :)
<Meanwhile> Can you blame me?
<Meanwhile> Look at you.
<DaringDerpy> bad...imagination...don't know the fitting word
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: in this game you mean?
<Chrysalis> WHAT
<Chrysalis> they are replacing the people with zombies
<Chrysalis> WTF
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, yes. This game.
<Sumica> 00,10I have to say this is looking real clean Shizuka
<Kandarihu> Zombie drivers
<Chrysalis> half the fun was killing the innocents
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: lol thatd be an interesting twist
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol Stormy like my abuse warning page for my forum? http://www.soliforum.com/abuse.php
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> :P
<MadSurge> Sumica: indeed! Also, hi :D
<Kandarihu> AND it would justify DJ Atomica declaring the Burnout Elite to be a "noble order of drivers"
<Vordox> Sumica: It damn well is
<Meanwhile> Crunk.
<shizumobile> Ow...
<GilDash> I thought Paradise City was from Appetite for Destruction, not 'Greatest Hits'? :S
<DaringDerpy> all these cars are driven by baby ponies
<Meanwhile> Spaloosh.
<Vordox> Lucky Shizu there
<shizumobile> That was dumb
<Meanwhile> Kahrenk.
<Sumica> 00,10ouch
<GilDash> Ouch...
<DaringDerpy> wall 1 shizu 0
<Meanwhile> I think by now the wall is on like, 7.
<GilDash> Mental note: Walls are stronger then you are.
<GilDash> Or your car.
<Vordox> Shizu cannot win against the walls, NOONE can
*Bronysith runs into Sumica s shins with a bull dozer
<Coldays> lag
<MadSurge> GilDash: unless you're the Hulk.
<Coldays> GilHULK
<GilDash> MadSurge: Well yes, but the Hulk doesn't really need to drive now, does he?
<MadSurge> GilDash: nope :D
<Coldays> no he jumps
<GilDash> *Boing!*
<Coldays> like a Boss
<Vordox> My wall sense is tingling
<Coldays> lol
<MadSurge> How's stuff GilDash? :)
<GilDash> MadSurge: Same old, same old. Yourself? :)
<Vordox> bang
<Vordox> 20 seconds prediction, not bad XD
<Vordox> Wall sense tingling about now... *Starts counting*
<Shizuka> 13moment
<Meanwhile> Walls are our greatest defense against the zerg.
<GilDash> You're predicting someone is going to crash in a game where the objective is to crash into cars. Of course it's going to happen eventually. XD
<Sumica> 00,10I think out of all of them I liked revenge the most
<Jmo> lolzerg
<Stormy> lol nice
<Coldays> tap boom
<Shizuka> 13phone call ><
<twilight_sprinkle> lol nop, no walls
<Vordox> My prediction!
<MadSurge> GilDash: I have a stuffed ear ( water from the pool) but I'm fine too!
<Meanwhile> Di-doop.
<Stormy> ("anonymous" has only got two n's though)
<GilDash> MadSurge: I always shake my head really hard when I get out just to make sure that doesn't happen.
<Stormy> Btw I'm on my way to the post office to ship your Rainbow Dash :)
<Bronysith> Monty python intermission plz

<MadSurge> GilDash: I restarted recently, just to get some muscular tone again :P
<Coldays> yes back to deh driving class
<Domo> and yeah c: It's all good
<Meanwhile> The road is angry. Sacrifice some cement to appease it.
<MadSurge> ^
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I hate captchas so i think my custom spam solution will prevent mostly everything without annoying users.
<LunasGuard> burnout best game to play when u piss at someone
<GilDash> MadSurge: Now it's winter here, which means rain everyday so I can't walk/run, I should probably get membership. And kettlebelling.
<MadSurge> And some cars too
<shizumobile> Aaaah
<Sumica> 00,10not much, just realazing a bit before day 7 of work
<Meanwhile> Skadoosh.

<Bronysith> Sumica: want me to hurt someone? : D
<Meanwhile> I'm attempting to make an onomatopiea for every crash.
*Dark92Enigma hugs Coldays DaringDerpy GilDash AJIsAwesome LunasGuard and salutes Meanwhile (he's not into hugs IIRC)
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: i know that feel

<GilDash> There's a right for that? Mind if I hop on?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hey Bronysith.
<Yahooz> Meanwhile: hasnt it always been?
<Meanwhile> Thus the fault is his, as decreed by the unofficial sanctions of the 2nd era.
<Bronysith> Yahooz: i call bullshit
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Shouldn't that be 'rite'?
<Meanwhile> GilDash: Probably, I'm not all that familiar with the term.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: ... Did I just correct your grammar? :O
<Yahooz> 2nd gen has alot of unofficial laws...
<GilDash> The world is about to end, the end is nigh, etc.
<Coldays> :O
<Meanwhile> Dat corkscrew.
<Bronysith> Yahooz: heres a comment on my picture where lelouch was stealing the cabbage guys cabbages "Obviously, I stole the cabbage to feed my whiny ass group of so called "Black Knights." You leave them alone for a day and come back to find a bloody mess that used to be one of your underlings. Ougi says he doesn't know who ate him, but I thought I smelled human flesh on his breath."
<Stormy> I don't think they'll do international shipping
<Yahooz> text wall of whywpuldyoupostthat
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Stormy> it's going to be like $25 USD for shipping o_O that still okay?

<Major> XD
<Dark92Enigma> LunasGuard: same here.....but i stopped watching when the Third Hokage died
<Bronysith> he will probably say dragonball Z
<AJIsAwesome> I stopped watching after Shippuden came out.
<Bronysith> I stopped watching after naruto got the headband
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: yes, you say it's a ripoff of DBZ
<Dark92Enigma> IIRC*
<AJIsAwesome> You mean episode 1? :D
<Bronysith> 3
<Shizuka> 13blah
<Shizuka> 13brb
<Chrysalis> There's 10 kinds of people in this world, those who understand binary, those who dont, and those who weren't expecting a base 3 joke.
<pony_295501> hi everypony :)
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: dat randomness
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, pony_295501. :)
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: take your time
<GilDash> Nothing random about it. It makes perfect sense.
<cachi01> hi everypony :_)
<cachi01> :)*
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, cachi01. :)
<Dark92Enigma> hi cachi01!
<cachi01> paradise city stream? yay
<GilDash> cachi01: Why the long face? :p
<Coldays> Hi cachi01
<cachi01> GilDash: that was a typo mistake lol
<Coldays> and you pony_295501
<GilDash> cachi01: I know, just thought I'd make a lame joke out of it. :D
<cachi01> Coldays: dat was me lol
<Bronysith> I miss Interplay
<Coldays> omg
<cachi01> btw anypony else has problems with the chat embed?
<Bronysith> interplay made the original fallout, and my god it was awesome
<Coldays> the cachi01 has been dubbled
<GilDash> Didn't we have an Interplay reminiscence only a few days ago?
<Bronysith> the ability to kill anyone
<Bronysith> glorious
<cachi01> kill anyone? yay
<Bronysith> but of course there were consequences
<Coldays> indeed id start with Socks
<Bronysith> you could kill Main quest givers
<Bronysith> you could side with the main enemies
<GilDash> Coldays: But Socks are good! They make ponies look sexy. ;)
<cachi01> awesome
<Bronysith> target them in your sights and you could kill them
<Bronysith> even children
<Bronysith> those bastards trying to steal my caps
<cachi01> AWESOME
<Meanwhile> Could you stop adventuring and open a shop?
*Bronysith opens a shop of eggplants ontop of Meanwhile
<Coldays> yes not those Socks im talking about the brony Socks muahahahaha
<GilDash> Coldays: Bronies... with ponies... oh my. ;)
<cachi01> so chat is now PG 13+?
<Shizuka> 13you know... take any RPG where you go through dungeons... you amass a huge pile of valuable stuff
<Dark_Horst> that's a long phonecal
<Shizuka> 13why sell it to a merchant? you should be able to open your own shop
<Meanwhile> Exactly.
<Coldays> yea
<cachi01> Shizuka: is there any problem with the chat embed? it wont load for me
<Bronysith> Shizuka: finally someone with sense
<Dark_Horst> i usually just hoard it
<Meanwhile> But no. Sadly no one in fiction-world-of-the-moment sells land.
<GilDash> Probably because there's not as many crazy PC types in the world who would last as long as you?
<Bronysith> Shizuka: could you kill anyone in baldurs gate as well?
<Dark_Horst> if my fallout home would be sized realisticly according to the stuff i have in it.... i'd be living in a warehouse
<Shizuka> 13yes but you had a reputation score
<Bronysith> did they just glue that guys head to a turtle?
<Bronysith> Shizuka: so like fallout
<Shizuka> 13if it fell too low you'd get guards ambushing you pretty much all the time
<Shizuka> 13AH SURVE THE FLAMING FIST
<Bronysith> Shizuka: thats why i play lawful good
<cachi01> yay embed works
<Bronysith> and now the head exploded

<Meanwhile> GilDash: Fortunately it has one key weakness that we can exploit.

<AJIsAwesome> I am, Bronysith.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: dynamite?
<cachi01> take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and the drivers are crazy
<shizumobile> Crashing before phone call didn't help....
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Really? How many bothans died to bring you this information?
<thelonepony> Hi AJIsAwesome And MadSurge :)
<Bronysith> Corner the market and raise the price, thats how you win
<Dark92Enigma> Hi thelonepony!
<Meanwhile> GilDash: No less than 12. After driving into it at high speed multiple times one of them discovered a startling revelation. The wall doesn't move.
<Bronysith> Would you guys believe that life is just one big game?
<thelonepony> Hi Dark92Enigma :)
<alexxm> how are things thelonepony and Dark92Enigma
<GilDash> Meanwhile: By jove...
<Bronysith> time for the cornucopia of pain
<Bronysith> its where you take a cornucopia, and smash someone over their head with it
<Meanwhile> GilDash: As such we've started building around them. But it's slow going, whenever building starts walls seem to appear in the area. We have scientists trying to determine why.
<thelonepony> having a headache right now but good alexxm and you? :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hope you feel better, thelonepony. :)
<alexxm> i'm good thelonepony
<thelonepony> thanks AJIsAwesome :)

<Amu-chan> Later!
<GilDash> cachi01: You shouldn't drink and drive. You might spill your drink.
<GilDash> Then it'll get all over the upholstery, and it'll just be a terrible mess...
<cachi01> GilDash: i used to have that as my msn peronal message lol
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm: i heard AJ (WWE Diva and not our underrated pony) was forced to step down as GM.

<RDash5000> cachi01: No! Never enough! :[

<oni_link> NullRadix: oh yeah
<NullRadix> oni_link: and did you sing along to the... you know song?
<twilight_sprinkle> crysis, even the physics arent good
<Petrified_Discord> It's like bowling
<oni_link> NullRadix: Yes, I did :3
<Dark_Horst> lol. she ran him over. on foot
<cachi01> crysis lacks of so much code
<hunterman210> :$
<twilight_sprinkle> crysis lacks a lot of things
<twilight_sprinkle> all it has is good graphics really
<oni_link> hopefully the 3rd one is more polished
<Petrified_Discord> Maximum physics
<AJIsAwesome> Testing.
<AJIsAwesome> Nvm
<cachi01> k
<Kandarihu> This game is just demonstrating that you don't need a car for vehicular manslaughter
*cuteness_kitteh looks up at oni_link and purrs
*RDash5000 glomps AJIsAwesome
<twilight_sprinkle> it couldve been fun with the physics, but the game is just "shoot everyone with a gun"
<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkle: actually, it has a lot of things. you know, tactics, AI, giant boss enemies
<oni_link> also, have you guys heard of the new F2P game Crytek is making?
<Phase4> soo much grenade
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: in a sper suit
<Dark_Horst> what esle would you want in a shooter?
<cachi01> super*
<Yahooz> aw hell naw
<Safari|webchat> Give it some credit, it's a good 5 years old!
<Yahooz> he aint ded
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: tactics? what tactics?
<Petrified_Discord> And YOU get a grenade and YOU get a grenade and YOU get a grenade and
<Safari|webchat> @ twilight_sprinkle
<Meanwhile> He's waiting.
<pony_2532> Sorry if this was mentioned, but what game is this?
<cuteness_kitteh> ermahgerd sperr suits
<Yahooz> at any moment he'll stikre
<thelonepony> crysis
<twilight_sprinkle> Safari|webchat: the graphics are good for a 5 year old game, nothing else

<oni_link> *they
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: and the AI is pretty bad too
<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkle: the one's you have to use when you're actually playing it withput cheats or on somethin else than "super easy"-mode
<NullRadix> such... compliant hostages...
<cachi01> dat face
<Petrified_Discord> Meanwhile: Can't be. Graphics aren't good enough
<Yahooz> oce every blue moon he comes into mane

*cuteness_kitteh runs away, while saying "I just wanted to be petted!"
<Kandarihu> NullRadix, he's being grabbed by the throat. Ther's not much he CAN do
*AJIsAwesome hugs RDash5000 back :)
<fluttercry> 05,15lol
<Dken2021> you drowned him, he could've had cookies!
<NullRadix> Kandarihu: he could wiggle a little!
<fluttercry> 05,15WATER MY ONE WEAKNESS
<Safari|webchat> twilight_sprinkle: The physics etc thus tend to be judged by today's standards
<oni_link> should have had a V8 XD
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: it comes down to sniping more than any tactics,the suit runs out of gas too fast for any real tactics
<Phase4> Kandarihu, or do anything for that matter
<cachi01> what if the name of the korean was ben
<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkle: it's smart enough to use cover and circle you, instead of having you play target shooting, liek most shooters
<cachi01> and he died drowned
<Meanwhile> Ph'nglui mgwaghl Cthulhu R'yleh wahg naghl ftagn.
<Phase4> grabbed by the throat = legs and arms free to do stuff
<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkle: you sure you played the smae game as me?
<Meanwhile> Barrelled.
<oni_link> Phase4: theyre going through shock, dont tell me you wouldnt be scared of a dude in a suit like that?
<Dark92Enigma> nope. didn't work......my mom tells me to go, so i'll be off for tonight
<Petrified_Discord> Dat dash attack
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: the ai doesnt even think to stop driving a boat when you highjacked the boat and shooting at him
*cuteness_kitteh rubs up against Meanwhile
<hunterman210> oohp oohp oohp oohp open gangnam style
<cachi01> cya Dark9 Y U LEAVE SO FAST
<Phase4> oni_link, it's hardly shock if they were able to shoot him first
<Kandarihu> Well, he has to be careful not to do anything that would compel his captor to tighten his grip. The discipline of a man growing up in the most repressive dictatorship in the world is not to be underestimated.
<hunterman210> oohp oohp oohp oohp open gangnam style
<oni_link> well I know Id be scared
<Dken2021> their necks seems to be their one weakness
*Meanwhile scratches cuteness_kitteh behind the ears.

<cuteness_kitteh> I thought it was oppan o_o
<oni_link> I actually get annoyed with the pony toy commercials now, is that weird?
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: and idk what todays shooters youre playing, but in games like counter-strikes source the ai was very clever
<AJIsAwesome_> oni_link: I can understand that.
<cachi01> cuteness_kitteh: yeah the n didnt showed idk why
<Kurra> the heck, shooting rocks?
<cuteness_kitteh> cachi01: Seems legit.

<twilight_sprinkle> source is baws
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: I wish there was more steampunk pictures
<Safari|webchat> twilight_sprinkle: To be fair there are a huge number of physics-enabled objects compared to a lot of games of the time
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: updated graphics thats all
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: Same.
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: and new game modes
<cuteness_kitteh> I don't watch that stuff. Booooring!
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: I bought CS:GO because it was cheaper atm and now I have insta-regret
<twilight_sprinkle> Safari|webchat: where?
<thelonepony> well play with your yarn then cuteness_kitteh :3
<Safari|webchat> twilight_sprinkle: In crysis

<oni_link> wow
<cuteness_kitteh> ....No comment
<sub06905> thought that said bug banger
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: samurai are more drunk guys with swords
<Meanwhile> Realistic ninja were peasants fighting opressive regíme.
<Kandarihu> otakon, real ninjas are masters of stealth and were used as assassins and spies. Realistic ninjas at least hold to that.
<otakon> Dark_Horst: no Ninja were honorless samurai didn't you know that?
<Safari|webchat> Dken2021: I would get a copy, it's only like 10 dolars maybe?
<Safari|webchat> *dollars
<Meanwhile> otakon: that's ronin.

<fluttercry> 05,15Ronin were fallen samurai
<oni_link> no offense to anyone but I lol at the Christian dating adverts on the telly

<Dken2021> Safari|webchat sweet, might get one sometime

<Lyra`> that ronin didnt kill themselves
<Safari|webchat> might not be on for a couple weeks
<Lyra`> ^-^
<Safari|webchat> on holiday
<otakon> or they left their masters service
<Safari|webchat> bye
<Kandarihu> The thing is, ninjas would sometimes resort to deception to get away from a situation unscathed, and those tricks became legends in the eyes of those who survived a ninja encounter. These legends are the foundation of the fantastic ninja.
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Safari|webchat
<otakon> bye Safari|webchat take care
<Petrified_Discord> So he tried to run away from the frag, but you shot him back into it? Niiiiiice :)

<fluttercry> 05,15"We're going to test these two swords and see which is better, but we're not going to do the same test for both, so the scientific method is already wrong"

<CriticKitten> That show was AWFUL.
*cuteness_kitteh turns into a human and drinks Sprite

<Petrified_Discord> Although I DID learn about the metsubushi from DW, so they get a point from me for that. Just one, mind you.
<cuteness_kitteh> CriticKitten: Yay for kittens. ^_^
<RDash5000> twilight_sprinkle: katanas for the win
<fluttercry> 05,15But yeah, their testing method was flawed
<fluttercry> 05,15You can have two tests to compare something and expect it to be correct
<otakon> CriticKitten: yeah but didn't they show that the penetrative power of old gunpowder just wasn't that good? I mean christ in the 1800's they had MONKS taking flintlock shots at POINT BLANK RANGE and not only survived but resisted penetration through SHEER MUSCLE
<cowvarkian> fluttercry: like myth busters?
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Petrified_Discord> fluttercry: But they ran the simulation 1000 tiems u guise! It HAS to be legit! Rite?
<Kurra> wat?
<Kurra> o.o
<otakon> yeah PC simulations are NOT the same as physical ones
<fluttercry> 05,15Mythbusters used to be really good and they USED to do real science
<otakon> it was still a fun show
<thelonepony> what is it Kurra?
<otakon> fluttercry: until what?
<otakon> kaboom
<cowvarkian> otakon: until they didnt
<fluttercry> 05,15Petrified_Discord oh you mean the modified Rome Total War engine
<otakon> really?
<otakon> that is the high tech thing they used?
<cowvarkian> otakon: have you seen a revent mythbusters?
<cowvarkian> *recent
<DemoPegono> TF2 all the way. b o-o b
<otakon> cowvarkian: no I haven't really
<Kurra> I'm hearing things about munitions and tests....
<cowvarkian> otakon: ok
<twilight_sprinkle> idk how old that was, but all the mythbusters ive seen conists of so many compromises and pseudo-science thatn none of their results are credible
<thelonepony> ohai DemoPegono :)
<Sumica> 00,10but mythbusters got so much better when they started invloving the peole in the neighborhood.
<otakon> hiya Sumica
<Kurra> DemoPegono: do also d o-o b
<Kurra> :D
<DemoPegono> Hello, the lonepony.
<cowvarkian> Sumica: thats hilarious
<twilight_sprinkle> well maybe not none, but most
<Ryunosuke> ohai sumi
<Phase4> twilight_sprinkle, yeah, but its fun
<fluttercry> 05,15Also, Mythbusters bought Tested.com. Luckily nothing changed, but still I hate to see "Adam and Jamie's Tested" knowing they do nothing on that site
<CriticKitten> otakon: In that show, they demonstrated the blunderbuss as a complete crap shoot whose firing was dependent on roll of the die. And yet it managed to attain the pirate more kills than every other weapon combined, despite its extreme unreliability and mediocre-at-best penetration on plate armor.
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi
<DemoPegono> Thumbs up is awesome. b o-o b
<thelonepony> DemoPegono: you don't have to space my name :P
<otakon> CriticKitten: ah so that's your issue with it
<otakon> DemoPegono: okay please stop that
<CriticKitten> Pretty much forced to call bullshit on that show when that happens. :p
<DemoPegono> Why?
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: it can be fun, but i dont like the confidence with which they claim their results, and hearing people say well mythbusters proved it wrong, so its wrong"
<DemoPegono> Oh
<otakon> DemoPegono: I don't know, it's a bit aggravating is all
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: yeah
<DemoPegono> I see... it looks like boob...
<otakon> yeah and that
<DemoPegono> Lol
<otakon> also it can be considered spamming
<DemoPegono> ... how?
<otakon> I don't know ask the mods
<cowvarkian> otakon x DemoPegono
<cachi01> xd
<otakon> just giving you a head's up

<cachi01> otakon: but you ARE shipping
<otakon> seriously I don't want to go to Abu Dahbi
<Kandarihu> And to think I was wanting Mythbusters to test EMPs and faraday cages. Just doing a whole bit on it, maybe even a whole episode.
<cowvarkian> a free otakon with every purchase
<oni_link> cowvarkian: lmao
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: what? what did I do? I asked him to stop bc it was aggravating me
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: abu daru?

<CriticKitten> You know what was their dumbest episode though?
<cachi01> cuming in hot
<Dken2021> who be takin dem jerbs?
<otakon> KABOOM!
<CriticKitten> Spartan vs Ninja.
<fluttercry> 05,15lol
<Kandarihu> And besides, the shipping is harrassment.
<Petrified_Discord> Greek Spartan vs Halo Spartan
<cuteness_kitteh> Phoo. I have a lot of stuff to do... Bai everybody/kitty/pony
<otakon> CriticKitten: ugh wouldn't the Spartan have won?
<weeping_pegasi82> YAY violence!
<Dken2021> beautiful explosions
<cachi01> cya cuteness_kitteh :)
<otakon> bye cuteness_kitteh take care
<fluttercry> 05,15Spartan would own a ninja any day
<otakon> I think Micheal Bay was here
<thelonepony> Bye cuteness_kitteh :3
<otakon> fluttercry: yeah pretty sure on armor and weapons alone
<Petrified_Discord> Helicopter's like "fuck this shit"
<Dken2021> seeya cuteness_kitteh
<cachi01> otakon: nah. grass has'nt exploded yet
<CriticKitten> "Let's take a well-armored hoplite and pit it against a stealth-based fighter whose only advantage is the element of surprise. DURR HURR WHO WILL WIN"
<oni_link> Petrified_Discord: If the Mark VI is involved, the Greek Spartan is screwed
<otakon> cachi01: oh yeah good point
<fluttercry> 05,15Which cut better with R.Lee. Ermy. Broadsword or Katana?
<otakon> fluttercry: IIRC the katana, it CLEAVED through leather armor
<otakon> fluttercry: while the broadsword struggled with it
<fluttercry> 05,15CriticKitten I'm convinced that show was created in a room full of stoned people
<cachi01> fluttercry: spoon
<CriticKitten> fluttercry: Which is why it's funny because the episode ended as a total beatdown. The Spartan DESTROYED the Ninja. And his best weapon? THE SHIELD.
<twilight_sprinkle> well, katana Does cut better,its just that the broadsword is based more on power of the shot than cutting
<Phase4> so... the guys on this island have helecopters
<fluttercry> 05,15"W...what if a ninja fought a Spartan?"
<cowvarkian> fluttercry: it's a spike show, right
<fluttercry> 05,15DUUUUUDE
<DemoPegono> What's shipping?
<otakon> Phase4: its' the NK military ofc
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03sorry, was AFK~
<Kurra> That ally shold be saying Out instead of Over if he's not expecting a reply. :/
<Phase4> the airstrike was performed by normal jet craft
<Nittany_Discord> What if I exploded?
<fluttercry> 05,15cowvarkian yeah
<Kurra> Really.
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: u always explode!
<Phase4> but suddenly they have these vtol's things that can airlift tanks
<cowvarkian> fluttercry: then it probably was
<Coldays> im back
*Kurra , finest of hairsplitters.
<Kandarihu> DemoPegono, portraying a romantic relationship between two people.
<CriticKitten> YES. THE SHIELD was the Spartan's most effective weapon. Surprise surprise, it turns out when you hit people in the FACE with a hard metal plate, it hurts
*Nittany_Discord 11,01explodes
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: I'd have to sweep you up, you haven't exploded in a long time.
<thelonepony> DemoPegono: when you transport stuff via sea
<otakon> CriticKitten: lol
<Dken2021> haiyo Coldays
<Kandarihu> ...well NORMALLY it's between people.
*cowvarkian watches Nittany_Discord explode
*otakon sweeps up Nittany_Discord into a neat pile
<DemoPegono> Ah...
<Coldays> hi Dken2021
<fluttercry> 05,15Also did you guys hear? G4 is going away and becoming something else
<Kandarihu> But this is the internet
*cachi01 gathers Nittany_Discord's pieces
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01otakon: I know. Too busy with this maid thing.
<cowvarkian> fluttercry: oh, how sad
<otakon> fluttercry: ;_; wat
*Bronysith dusts Nittany_Discord up
<Kurra> fluttercry YAAAAY YAYAYAYAYAYAY
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: they have a nanosuit, i think vtol crafts are more likely
<fluttercry> 05,15There was nothing good there anymore. Adam Sessler was holding that place down and he got fired for being Adam Sessler
<Phase4> Spectrum_Rush, thats all fine and good, but why didnt they have new craft for the airstrike?
<fluttercry> 05,15Like Jeff Gerstmann getting fired from Gamespot for being honest in reviews
<Phase4> and who's producing those antiquated helicopters for the bad guys
<otakon> fluttercry: yeah true.. man I miss it the old Tech TV
<otakon> I loved Tech TV
<cowvarkian> fluttercry: seems legit
<cachi01> Phase4: shits expensive
<fluttercry> 05,15otakon Screensavers all day every day
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. Tech TV was nice.
<Dken2021> aww man, Adam Sessler was the only good there
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: a wizard did it
<cachi01> dat console
<otakon> fluttercry: yeah :) I loved that one cinema one that showed the short CG movies
<cowvarkian> Spectrum_Rush: hah, I remember saying that
<Phase4> Spectrum_Rush, nanites *snort snort*
<otakon> SHE'S A PHONY!
<otakon> a BIG FAT PHONY!
<Phase4> wait, what?
<Kurra> When TechTV, that was useful and fun and geeky neat, got eaten by G4, and G4 spouted only sensational stuff, it all just went wrong, completely.
<Phase4> could have sworn the tank shot bullets for a sec
<fluttercry> 05,15Tech TV was awesome because it had Extended Play, Screensavers, and Call for Help
<CriticKitten> One thing to Deadliest Warrior's credit, though.
<cowvarkian> that web soup show they had was nice
<fluttercry> 05,15I learned so much about computers there.
<CriticKitten> The fight scenes were hilariously choreographed.
<Petrified_Discord> CriticKitten: Especially pirate vs knight
<fluttercry> 05,15Luckily Leo Laporte is still on the radio
<Kurra> Screensavers was intelligent, and FUN and witty.
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: Clarke's three laws
<CriticKitten> I like how they each politely stop hitting each other so that they can each go through their arsenal of weapons
<RedDragonX|2> If he don't know ya he wont talk to ya lol
<Dken2021> remember that time AoTS showed Mugen on television and thought it was Marvel vs Capcom?
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: ikr
<Phase4> Spectrum_Rush, who's what now?
<fluttercry> 05,15Oh I think Kevin Perria got fired too. and he was the last person left from Tech TV days
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws
<fluttercry> 05,15or however you spell his name
<CriticKitten> "Excuse me Mr Pirate, but I'm going to grab my mace now if you don't mind." "Not at all, good sir! I was just thinking of grabbing my grenade." "Waitwat." BOOM
<Spectrum_Rush> look at hte third Phase4

<otakon> CriticKitten: lol you are having WAY too much fun deconstructing that you are...
<fluttercry> 05,15I'll have you know I'm buying Black Ops 2 at midnight on release day. Why? Because I'm stupid, but hanging out with friends at 3 AM at Ihop is worth it
<otakon> fluttercry: agreed,

<cowvarkian> fluttercry: I'm sure it is
<Buytoast> make sure you get a Grand Slam

<Saturn> 08,01Raisin Weekend is kinda special
<Saturn> 08,01it's a family bonding time
<Prince_Shadow_Night> Well, I only really came here to check that this wasn't some kind of religion based on mlp, that would have screwed me adn my mates over if it was seeing as we are making one ourselves
<Saturn> 08,01usually involving a lot of alcohol
<Prince_Shadow_Night> toodles!!
<Saturn> 08,01i'll take you through it step by step
<Saturn> 08,01first, on the sunday morning, you go to a 'tea' party at your mother's house
<cowvarkian> Prince_Shadow_Night: last time I checked we arent a religion
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^

<DashWithRainbows> That's a toughy. I'd suggest trying your best to go over the lines with the mouse. It will be tedious and may hurt your wrist a lot, you may be able to pull it off. As for colouring, add a layer and put it under the redone sketch's layer.
