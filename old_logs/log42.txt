*RedJolteon is rather emotional, too XP
<Ascendant> and sometimes it's too late to go back to what they had

<Ascendant> one moment
<SilverSonic> ok.
<Ascendant> "I am a being who has a path laid out but yet to walk it, to choose between the forking paths, between the darkness of the unknown and the paths already taken. I am overshadowed and ignored by many, but I can know and see, and that is enough. "

<Ascendant> "I am free to choose my path, but I am yet to stray off it, in fear of the unknown and the shadows that follow behind. I am someone who has been perceived in many different ways by those around me, but those perceptions are not my own. "
*Light_Latias 12decides to stay out of it
<Ascendant> "They only know what they can see, not what I feel, know or believe."
<Ascendant> Can you understand that?
<SilverSonic> Yes.
<Ascendant> Then make up your own
<SilverSonic> ok.
<Ascendant> Look not at the result, but at the process
<Ascendant> Only your perception and opinion matters
<Ascendant> just remember that
<Ascendant> only you know who you are and what you feel
<SilverSonic> yeah.
<Ascendant> and lol, you need to stop caring about what I say :p

<prince-dari> Cya.
<Ascendant> if it was an accident then they're not necessarily a bad person
<prince-dari> I remember my uncle picked a up cat by the tail and neck before, strangely it didn't seem to mind.
<Ascendant> and it was their choice and they have to deal with it
<prince-dari> I tried it, the cat didn't care.
<Ascendant> if they're guilty, then they acknowledge that they're a "bad person"
<Ascendant> if not, then they aren't, at least in their own eyes
<SilverSonic> heh

<Zoroark> my connection is being really derp for no reason :I
*IcyNinetales 2is currently playing Pokemon White
<SilverSonic> Hi IcyNinetales
<RedJolteon> Hi :3
<IcyNinetales> 2Hello. :3
*RedJolteon loves Pokemon White
<prince-dari> Put piece of glass in mouth for 5 hours, handle glass for 20 minutes, cut self. HOW DO?
*SilverSonic has no Pokemon games anymore :(
<RedJolteon> Aw :C
<prince-dari> Wasn't even sharp, it was just a little mirror thing.
<IcyNinetales> 2I like them both for the fact that during the cutscenes with Reshiram/Zekrom, their cries are lengthy and drawn out.
<SilverSonic> I COULD always buy one on VC
<SilverSonic> but meh
*RedJolteon just likes the characters X3
<IcyNinetales> 2Still, I'm curious if there's going to be a new game that goes into the backstory of Kyurem. O_o
<RedJolteon> There might be.
<RedJolteon> Kyurem is underloved.
<IcyNinetales> 2I hope so. I like Kyurem as much as the other two. :3
<RedJolteon> It's actually kind of cute X3
*SilverSonic is confuzzled about Pokemon games X3
<IcyNinetales> 2Since my Pokemon White is the game I play without using my Pokemon from previous games, I'm going to start with Tepig and have Reshiram, Zekrom, and Kyurem in my game early on.
<SilverSonic> I'm a too big of a Mario & Sonic fan XD
<RedJolteon> X3
<SilverSonic> to understand pokemon i mean
<RedJolteon> I'm working on training my old buddies from SoulSilver.
<RedJolteon> Charzy's at the top of the list right now.
<DSD> Spyrorocks[Air] you there?
*SilverSonic Now Playing: Ozzy Osbourne - I Don't Wanna Stop [Judgment Day Edit]

*IcyNinetales 2is listening to the battle theme for Team Plasma
<DSD> 10If you are Darkeiya said that you asked TTE not to make anyone admin and that they were trying to talk to you about that
<SilverSonic> nice
<SilverSonic> thats a good song :3
<DSD> 10I would like to ask if i could have admin or you let TTE make me admin
<RedJolteon> Yeah, it was my favorite battle theme.
*SilverSonic Now Playing: SilverSonic - Song of Storms -Rock Mix-
<SilverSonic> Ive got about 174 mixes ive made
<SilverSonic> includes failed attempts too
<IcyNinetales> 2Team Plasma's battle theme is better than Team Galactic's with Team Magma/Aqua's battle theme being in second place.
<RedJolteon> Mhm :3
*Ray lazy-yawns
<IcyNinetales> 2And N was the best Protagonist/Antagonist in that game.
<RedJolteon> Yes.
<RedJolteon> By far~
<RedJolteon> <3
<IcyNinetales> 2Plus, N is really cute! <3
<RedJolteon> X3
*RedJolteon is a fangirl X3

*IcyNinetales 2knows that Ecco the Dolphin and Ecco the Tides of Time were the most difficult Sega Genesis games
<SilverSonic> LOL i dont have a SEGA Genesis
<SilverSonic> sadly
*RedJolteon is actually more of a fangirl for FerrisWheelShipping.
<RedJolteon> X3
<SilverSonic> i did however want a SEGA Saturn
<SilverSonic> lol also it reminds me of the song
<SilverSonic> Segata Sanshiro
<SilverSonic> XD
<SilverSonic> best Saturn song ever
<IcyNinetales> 2If you want a good collection of games and you own a PS2/PSP, I recommend Sega Genesis collection.

<RainBroDash> oh lawdy
<RainBroDash> did you get an adults wristband i guess? ;)
<prince-dari> They were pretty relaxed about asking for ID.
<RainBroDash> sick
<prince-dari> My sister and parents ordered most of my drinks for me though.
<RainBroDash> last night (10 months after my 18 birthday) was the first night I distinctly remember not being ID'd
<RainBroDash> looking like I'm 12 ftw
<RainBroDash> not last night, bleugh, i mean wednesday night
<Apokalipse> You need to grow an awesome mustache
<prince-dari> Haha.
<Apokalipse> and never get asked for ID again
<RainBroDash> >implying I CAN grow an awesome mustache
<RainBroDash> I'm practically a girl.
<RainBroDash> (in terms of facial hair, not man-parts O_O)
<prince-dari> Girls don't get asked for ID. :P
<RainBroDash> x
<RainBroDash> xD*
<Apokalipse> I have too much facial hair. For being 15 anyway. I don't want to shave, it's boring!
<prince-dari> One of the people my sister met had me drinking a mixture of gin and champagne.
<RainBroDash> pahahaha
<prince-dari> It actually taste alright. O_o
<RainBroDash> that is a king combo i will say right now
<prince-dari> tastes*
<Apokalipse> I love champagne
<Apokalipse> well, I like wine
<Apokalipse> therefore I like champagne too
<RainBroDash> My physics teacher walked in on three of us physics students sipping gin from a hip flask in the toilets at our prom because it was 4:25 for a pint. The lad asks for some of it.
<prince-dari> I like limoncello.
<prince-dari> LOL
<RainBroDash> I love my physics teacher
<prince-dari> Nice teacher.
<RainBroDash> best teacher too
<Apokalipse> My physics teacher is srs business. Nobody dares to misbehave during his classes
<Apokalipse> Unlike every other class
<Apokalipse> ever
<Apokalipse> Especially german
<RainBroDash> hah
<Apokalipse> One of my class mates taped the door handle, so the teacher couldn't get in
<Apokalipse> suddenly principal
<Apokalipse> Oh yeah, it's a good idea to mention one of my other school mates got taped to a chair that class too
<Apokalipse> principal + taped door handle + student taped to chair = no fun
<prince-dari> Lol.
<RainBroDash> ah :D
<RainBroDash> fuck. just went to turn on my xbox to play some cod
<RainBroDash> forgot it RRoD'd last night...
<RainBroDash> WOOOOOOOOO
<Apokalipse> I don't have an xbox
<Apokalipse> I have a PS3 though
<Apokalipse> too cheap to buy any games
<Apokalipse> So I only have about 5
<RainBroDash> I literally own two Xbox game discs
<RainBroDash> they're both CoD...
<Apokalipse> I don't have any CoD games. I have Gran turismo 5, GTA4, GTA4 liberty city stories, the orange box, NFS:Hot pursuit and Little big planet 2
<RainBroDash> NFS: Hot Pursuit
<RainBroDash> that's a classic right there
<Apokalipse> okay, that's 7 games, but I suppose GTA4 and liberty city stories counts as one
<Apokalipse> It's a really fun game. I liked the original, I liked the PS2 game, but this one is the best
<Apokalipse> online play ftw
<RainBroDash> I was referring to the original :P
<Apokalipse> Yeah, I figured
<RainBroDash> :D
<Apokalipse> I just thought I'd make sure you know I'm not referring to the original
<RainBroDash> ah alrighty :P
<Apokalipse> I mostly play Gran turismo 5
<Apokalipse> It was the first game I got too
<Apokalipse> as a PS3 + GT5 bundle
<RainBroDash> fair

<Apokalipse> Hey, do you know the show Allo Allo?

<Ascendant> Articuno
<Ascendant> SMF has a security exploit up to version 1.1.16
<Articuno> Whats that?
<Articuno> I mean, what exploit?
<Ascendant> It's an attachment exploit
<Ascendant> allows someone to upload a remote access file to the server
<Ascendant> and also, when you're logged on the forums
<Ascendant> this shows under the quick login bit at the top
<Ascendant> "Login with username, password and session length show_facebook(); "
<Articuno> I know
<Articuno> lol
<Articuno> I spent ages trying to remove that XD
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> but yeah
<Articuno> I just left it in the end but I should have another go ..
<Ascendant> the exploit is the main thing
<Ascendant> Well, it looks like PHP isn't parsing the tag correctly
<Articuno> It's because I deleted the mod
<Ascendant> Ah
<Articuno> Manually...
<Ascendant> well, it has to be in the code somewhere
<Articuno> There'll be some file I forgot.. trouble is I can't be botehred looking
<Ascendant> rofl
<Ascendant> don't worry, I'm lazier
<Ascendant> well heh, have fun
<Ascendant> I'm more worried about the exploit which means I need to update
<Articuno> yeh but 1.1.16 isnt out is it?
<Articuno> Also yay for shared hosting, my host will definitely have some way to combat that if it does happen to ours
<Ascendant> dunno
<Ascendant> http://www.devside.net/blog/smf-exploit-like-phpbb-hack
<Ascendant> it's that one
<Ascendant> which doesn't give info on it though
<Samui> 1.1.14 is the latest in the 1.1.x series.
<Ascendant> http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=272393.0
<Ascendant> Ah right
<Samui> oh, derp. well, that's the latest that's available on their download page, at least, from what i can tell.
<Ascendant> derp
<Ascendant> 1.1.17 seems to be out
<Ascendant> unless they changed that
<Samui> I don't use the 1.1.x series, so I'm out of the loop on that one. I'm using 2.0 RC4 now, and testing out 2.0 final.
<Ascendant> ah it's 1.1.6/7
<Ascendant> not 1.1.1x
<Ascendant> well
<Samui> we both misread. xD
<Ascendant> I prefer 2.0 RC2
<Ascendant> or well, RC3

<Skylands> 10ASCENDANT
<Skylands> 10I ALREADY TOLD YOU I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY
<Ascendant> ):
<Skylands> 10I'll play checkers if you want though
<Ascendant> XELI
<Ascendant> PLAY CHESS WITH ME
<Ascendant> I haven't played checkers for aeons
<Skylands> 10You're such a nerd for playing anyway
<Espeon> 06Already multitasking AND playing video games >-<
<Espeon> 06And I haven't played it for
<Skylands> 10What CPU, Ascendant?
<Espeon> 06ages lol
<Skylands> 10What about*
<Ascendant> ?
<Skylands> 10Playing against the computer?
<Ascendant> computers are boring
<Ascendant> I can never beat the one on linux
<Skylands> 10That should motivate you to try harder next time then
<Ascendant> damn
<Ascendant> it
*Ascendant goes back to playing 4-in-a-row
<Ascendant> stupid game
<Dermathil> Silver still around?
<HyperMetalLugia> Ooh
<Ascendant> just lost again
<HyperMetalLugia> Can I play it
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Ascendant> sec
<HyperMetalLugia> or not
<HyperMetalLugia> BRb
<Ascendant> just lost
<Ascendant> 50%
<Ascendant> sloooooow
<HyperMetalLugia> oh
<HyperMetalLugia> So at least THIS floppy works
<HyperMetalLugia> need to reformat the other
<Quanyails> 7Meep.
<Quanyails> 7So, what'd I miss?
<Ascendant> nothing much
<Ascendant> except for me opting to stay up til 2 to wait for the stupid thing to finish downloading >|
<Ascendant> oh, and raging at some games
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Quanyails> 7Feel free to sleep. :
<Quanyails> 7:P*
<Ascendant> how big is the damn server anyway
<Ascendant> oh it's 1.8GB
<Ascendant> ow
<Ascendant> 54% atm
<HyperMetalLugia> fuu
<Ascendant> and Quan, I don't want to kill the download
<HyperMetalLugia> formatting failed
<Pinkie> I don't think so
<Quanyails> 7You can pause Steam downloads, if that's what you're doing.
<Ascendant> I'm doing it from the terminal
<Ascendant> so I can't pause it
<Ascendant> without stopping it
<Ascendant> I have no GUI
<Quanyails> 7I don't know what that means. :P
<Ascendant> basically
<HyperMetalLugia> why not ;p
<HyperMetalLugia> Linux sucks ?
*HyperMetalLugia flees
<Ascendant> it's all done from a command line
<Ascendant> nah
<Ascendant> it's so much better :p
<Ascendant> but yeah
<Ascendant> there's no buttons or anything, Quan
<Ascendant> it's like IRC, you have to type everything
<Ascendant> 56%
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<Quanyails> 7I think I get you.
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> 58%
*Ascendant yawns
<Dman> Is 'Independence Day' shown today, or is that Sunday's?
<Quanyails> 7Well, at least you're downloading that much faster than my computer. :P
<Ascendant> it's on a server with a 100mbps connection
<Ascendant> or supposed to have one
<HyperMetalLugia> One of the highschools here were throwing out server racks :p
<HyperMetalLugia> Big old rusty things
<HyperMetalLugia> Or UPS units
<Ascendant> so uh, Quanyails
<Ascendant> is there anything I need to do after running/installing it?
<Ascendant> admin or something?
<Quanyails> 7I think you need to configure some settings or somewhat.
<Ascendant> and are there different "lands" or something?
<Quanyails> 7Maps?
<Quanyails> 7Yeah, if you want to set up a certain rotation.
<Ascendant> I don't know anything :p
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<Quanyails> 7I don't know how to configure server options, but if you'd like a map rotation, have it primarily CP with a small dose of CTF and PL.
<Ascendant> wat
<HyperMetalLugia> ^ Wat^2
<Quanyails> 7Abbreviations for different map/game modes. o3o
<Ascendant> 65%
<Ascendant> I'm getting tired
<Ascendant> this might go until 2:30
<Quanyails> 7As I said, feel free to sleep at any time.
<Ascendant> I don't want to leave it running
<Ascendant> because it means I have to leave my laptop on
<Creideiki> I had some retrocomputing stuff to do yesterday (copying a hard disk and box of 8" floppy diskettes). However, my plans were delayed due to extreme cuteness.
<Espeon> 06I would help with the config and such but I'm rather busy >-<
<Ascendant> and if there's configuration required at the end of the ./steam download
<Ascendant> then I'm screwed
<Creideiki> I have photographed said extreme cuteness, which I have finally gotten off my memory card: http://upload.cetafurs.com/100_0926.jpg :P
<Pinkie> Is there a showtime list somewhere?
<HyperMetalLugia> aww
<Ascendant> actually
<Ascendant> Xeli
<Ascendant> do you want to shutdown my laptop when it's done?
<Dermathil> Independence Day is today
<Dermathil> Saving Private Ryan is tomorrow
<Espeon> 06you can wait until tomorrow or something, lol
<Dermathil> I'm looking to watching Kick-Ass another time. I ****ing loved that movie.
<Ascendant> I hate leaving my laptop on though >:
<Espeon> 06:<
<Ascendant> but okay

<Angel_Espeon> 13I'd buy those LOL
<Apokalipse> or today...
<Apokalipse> But oh well
<Aurora> 6same
<Hipster_Brony> 8Silver, was that you who said your power went out or somepony else?
<Aurora> 6I've been looping the Portal 2 OST for a very very long time lol
<Aurora> 6 50 songs of GLORIOUS
<Apokalipse> Oh wait. Saving Private Ryan is also today. It's cool, I don't like sleep anyway.
<Silverscreen> 11That be meh.

*Silverscreen 11is watching NSync to get rid of the taste of being BeiberRoll'd by his own Youtube account.
<Aurora> 6unless you got the official one lol
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Aurora> 6cuz apparently they're missing a crapton of songs
<Quanyails> 7Well, 2/3.
<Hipster_Brony> 8BUT WHY?
<Aurora> 6including "Reconstructing Science" >.>
<Quanyails> 7It's in there, I think.
<Silverscreen> 11Because NSync is still better than that shit.
<Aurora> 6oh good cuz that song is legit
<Hipster_Brony> 8why would you put yourself through more torture?
<Quanyails> 7Is it that one that was in the Potato ARG in the BitTrip section?
<Silverscreen> 11It's less torture than Beiber
<Silverscreen> 11At least NSync songs are bearable.
<Aurora> 6in english?
<Silverscreen> 11I rather hear Bye Bye Bye over BABY BABY BABY
<Quanyails> 7The Alternate Reality Game where GLaDOS hacked into various games, in this case, Bit Trip Beat, which had this song?
<Apokalipse> Why not just listen to something good?
<Apokalipse> Just a thought...

<Bakphoon> damn i'm tired
<RainBroDash> oooo ty silver, sorry
<RainBroDash> and HAI DMAN <3
<Bakphoon> i'm sitting here trying to think of something i said not 5 minutes ago
<Dman> Hey man
<RainBroDash> got a nice amount of sleep? :3
<Dman> So does independence day start at 8PM est?
<Dman> Yes, yes I did
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes, dman
*Umbreon throws Bakphoon into a river of chocolate
<Dman> Oh thanks Hipster_Brony
<Dman> That's 6 hours 40 minutes away? That's a long time
<RainBroDash> suck it up dman :P
<Dman> I got my Physics book right here to...do stuff while I wait ; )
<RainBroDash> :D
*Bakphoon drowns.
<Pyrate> I'm just relaxing and watching a few LPs.
<Pyrate> ...maybe I should do something that doesn't involve the computer
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Afternoon gaiz
<Pyrate> Seeing as I'll be staring at this monitor for four hours straight once the event starts :I
<Dman> Afternoon
*darky saves Bakphoon
*Bakphoon has already died a chocolatey death.
*darky uses her dark powers to reanimate Bakphoon
<Pyrate> According to my mirror my eyes are about to turn red.
<Pyrate> I'll just relax with some piano for the next half hour, then.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Ouch :(
<Pyrate> I'll see you people once the thing starts
<Pyrate> Turning off the monitor.
<Dman> Piano : D
*Bakphoon dies again because his lungs are filled with chocolate.
*May would like some chocolate, but prefers her chocolate not inside someone's internal organs.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Mods, I was on briefly last night but had to leave due to lag, and was wondering if DCD has the ability to turn off the subtitles on Austin Powers?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> It's just that some of that movie's gags don't work quite the same way with them on
<Dman> It was hardsubs
<Dman> so the subs were PART of the video : /
<RainBroDash> yeah they were stuck in the vid file
<RainBroDash> :/
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Ah, thought so.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> No problem, just wondering.
<Dman> although with the magique of .mkv files... : P
*Bakphoon was thrown into a river of chocolate.
<Dman> ...If anyone knows what I'm on about
<RainBroDash> it gave it a new dimension of humour at points, for some who've seen it multiple times
<RainBroDash> :D
<Apokalipse> Hey, when did RBD get here? Hey RBD
<Dman> I suppose so : )
*darky sights "always me..." then does CPR on Bakphoon
<Apokalipse> Or Dman...
<Dman> it's apokalipse again hai!
<Apokalipse> hey Dman
<RainBroDash> and Dman I'm afraid my amazing wealth of knowledge does not extend that far
<May> 14Ohh, were you in Candyland, or in Charlie's Chocolate Factory?
<RainBroDash> Apokalipse! hai :D
<Dman> so .mkv is like a video file rite but within one file you have subs that you can enable/disable
<Umbreon> 12no
<RainBroDash> :o
<Umbreon> 12just #silverwings
<Apokalipse> RBD, you still owe me one brohoof
<Dman> in fact, you can have multiple audio AND video AND subtitle files, but all within ONE file called .mkv
<Dman> : D
<RainBroDash> @Apokalipse >come at me bro
<Dman> heh
<May> 14Gasp.

<RainBroDash> D:
<Pyrate> I don't know why but I tolerate that annoying pony a lot more than before.
<Dman> But silverscreen you gotta be here : (
<WhatPAyne> Does anyone realize that the cutiemarks are quite ambiguous in meaning?
<Dman> You so funny, http://i.imgur.com/MhSERh.png
<Sathi> poor applebloom :(
<maxaminusone> lol, did you guys decide you didn't get enough ponies last night? :)
<potatojack> You were supposed to eat it if caught Apple Bloom!
<Rellek> nope
<RaZor921> I'm playing Mortal Kombat at the same time. Beating Shao Kahn on Expert? Challenge Accepted
<Dermathil> Color-swapped Scootaloo in that class o_o
<DragonRage> There's something I've never gotten: Why was Twist laughing?

<Sol> Twist is just a happy pony?
<Silverscreen> 11I crashed my Mibbit posting that. XD
<Pyrate> Twist bounce?
<Bane> She's a two-faced bitch, that's what she is
<Silverscreen> 11THEY'LL MAKE YOU THMIIIIILE!
<WhatPAyne> For example the teacher could have been florist bc of the flowers.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> DragonRage: Sometimes you just have to admit a joke is funny even if it's at a friend's expense
<Dman> Lol, Ghosties I have about 15 good screencaps hiar: http://imgur.com/a/pBnx8
<SirSprinkles> 6Mibbit cannot handle all they NYAN
<Sol> Needs more Twist
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Or she's a Scootaloo and is afraid of what Tiara would think if she didn't laugh
<Silverscreen> 11Agreed, Sol.
<Dman> Including NOT THE BEES, that was funny too
<MonsieurLeFlour> Shame, I've been meaning to watch Deathstalker 2 but I probably won't be able to attend the next BMN
<potatojack> Bitch ponies.
<SirSprinkles> 6Twist's "just look at all the shits I give" face. XD
<Dman> eeeeyup
<Bane> Wait what does their cutie marks even represent?
<Ignaesia> yfw Sapphire Shores has no cutie mark
<WhatPAyne> But the teacher chose to make it mean that she's supposed to help students "bloom".
<Hipster_Brony> 8NAO
<Bane> A silver spoon...?
<Sol> Their destiny/personality
<Dman> what nao hipster?

<Silverscreen> 11"Shh, I'm trying to hear the Apples
<Sol> Silverscreen: Yay! I'm not alone in thinking of that song!
<SirSprinkles> 6APPLES
<Colgate> Pie!
<Dman> I see dead apples
<Apokalipse> APPLES
<Rellek> APPLES
<potatojack> The apples tell me to kill Silver Spoon.
<Espeon> 06is it really that easy
<Dermathil> Were the Oranges family also the last ones in their class?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Mark! Mark! Mark!
<SilverSonic> nah
<SilverSonic> ;p
<MonsieurLeFlour> Horse apples
<Silverscreen> 11There's a leprechaun in mah applefield
<summerstorm> The apples they speak to me... they understand me
<Skylands> 10Ohai SS
<Dman> tennus
<WhatPAyne> Same with rarity. Her cutiemark is gems. So it makes sense that she should be miner. But she chose to be tailor.
<Colgate> Aggressive marketing comign up!
<Silverscreen> 11He tells me to buuurrn things.
<Dman> wat
<Pyrate> Apple art?
<SilverSonic> Ohai Sky
<Apokalipse> SHE DESTROYED THAT PAINTING

<Dermathil> WHOOVES
<BilboFaggins> dr whooves
<Colgate> Woctor Whooves!
<Bane> that artist pony had twilights...
<Rellek> there was no painting
<Sol> Cutie Marks are more symbolic than literal, imo
<DragonRage> And then The Doctor was terrified by a little girl.
<Silverscreen> 11Applebloom: She intimidates time lords.
<Dman> yup
<Pyrate> Dr. Whoof doesn't want apples?
<Sol> BACK TO THE TARDIS
<potatojack> The daleks are nicer than you kid.
<Ghosties> 4Wow, Dman, you certainly screencapped a lot

<Pyrate> Wait

<Pyrate> Also, only 4 bits for all those apples?
<Apokalipse> umad? Gimme all your apples

<Ghosties> 4Dman

<Dermathil> Equestrian Express...
<Dman> Um...the ones I can : D
<Ghosties> 4Oh, I see
<WhatPAyne> Doodlemood, yes. But everyone in this series makes it sound like they dictate your destiny.
<Dman> So this one today yes, but I need to leave at some point for about 30 mins to tidy my house
<SirSprinkles> 6He used all of the testosterone in Equestria to grow that mustache.
<BilboFaggins> why did they make twist autistic assburgers

<Silverscreen> 11lol

<MonsieurLeFlour> Le gasp
<Pyrate> Apple Bloom DOES NOT WANT
<Colgate> Me gusta!
<Bane> I don't see why applebloom cares about showing up to the party so much
<Hipster_Brony> 8Twist's special talent is diabetes
<Ghosties> 4At Silverscreen: *slow clap*
<Apokalipse> RBD I see what u did there
<BilboFaggins> like a stereotype nerd
<SirSprinkles> 6That was an M. Night level plot twist right there...
<Sol> And then Twist was never again
<potatojack> Styling on you, Apple Bloom.
<Dermathil> Someone gotta start a credit card compagny called Equestrian Express...
<WhatPAyne> Oh man was I glad they did not decide to make Twist that big character...
<DragonRage> Isn't it sad, Twist?

<Pyrate> Got 44 on the quiz.
<photoFINISHHIM> FORGIVE THIS BLAS-FEMUR'S BAD PUNS
<Elky> I don't want to watch kick-ass with all the lag, but it'll do
<Ghosties> 4The hardest area for me was the joke names Spike gave the victims of the poison
<Ghosties> 4I only got one of those right
<photoFINISHHIM> I got 3 of those
<Elky> what one?
<Silverscreen> 11Appletini

<Silverscreen> 11Twilight Flopple
<Ghosties> 4Flutterguy
<Pyrate> When did Spike give a name to Twilight?
<DragonRage> Comedy!
<Ghosties> 4That was it
<Silverscreen> 11Hairity
<SirSprinkles> 6...those are easy.
<Silverscreen> 11Flutterguy
<MonsieurLeFlour> Dash appearance makes this episode 20% cooler
<Darf14> Rainbow Crash
<photoFINISHHIM> Appletini, Spitty Pie, and Flutterguy
<SirSprinkles> 6Spitty Pie
<Pyrate> I can not remember him calling her Twilight Flopple
<Ghosties> 4I haven't watched Bridle Gossip in forever
<Silverscreen> 11Spitty Pie
<Elky> I got all of them, but the instruments had me stumped
<Pyrate> Did he do so later in the episode?
<photoFINISHHIM> oh and Rainbow Crash, so 4?
<Ghosties> 4In fact, I bet I've only watched it one time
<Sol> I got a 45/60. I am unworthy ;_;
<SirSprinkles> 6Let's see if I can fix this for reals...
<Silverscreen> 11KICK-ASS IS NEXT!
<Elky> Hairity
<Ghosties> 4I got the instruments easy
<DragonRage> He called her Twilight Flopple as an aside while they were leaving for the forest.

<Darf14> nope
<drfsupercenter> 03and I blame Articuno for that one
<Roleplay4life> 5Yay it's cooler here than it was yesterday~ :3
<Elky> I went to a boarding school and boy, there were food fights
<Roleplay4life> 5DRF, but have you seen them live?
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Ghosties> 4He's not a brony, he's some douchebag that showed no emotion when his mom died
<Pyrate> Those guys are boring.
<drfsupercenter> 03I generally don't like live performances
<Roleplay4life> 5With the TWELVE STRING BASS
<Hipster_Brony> 8SPIDERMAN DERAIL
<Roleplay4life> 5and the FIVE NECK GUITAR
<Dermathil> Yeah, Kick-Ass 2 is coming in 2012
<Roleplay4life> 5D:
<Darf14> I wanted a food fight in my high school but it never happened
<Ace> !seen PResea
<Growlithe> PResea was last seen here 14 days, 13 hours, 14 minutes ago.
*Silverscreen 11had fist fights on a daily basis in his school, food fights in every week.
<Ghosties> 4Hell, I think his group of friends are even worse
<potatojack> He wants to be Paris Hilton?
<Elky> heh
<drfsupercenter> 03sorry but all the videos of live stuff I've seen suck
<Roleplay4life> 5But a live performance is the truest mark of a band! :3 (IMO lol..)
<drfsupercenter> 03Eh
<RainBroDash> @hipster_brony don't make me post gary oak
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't care
<drfsupercenter> 03I like music that's catchy
<Ghosties> 4The dick with the glasses is the worst
<Guest8057456> Actually 2 volumes appeared right now
<drfsupercenter> 03if it takes some post-processing to make it sound good, so be it
<drfsupercenter> 03look at Eiffel 65
<HeavyMetalPony> No, love interest is worst character
<Hipster_Brony> 8inb4 ten badges
<Sol> That fabulous hair
<Roleplay4life> 5cheaptrickiscatchy /shot
<drfsupercenter> 03they were insanely popular in like 2000
<Ghosties> 4The only good characters are Big Daddy and Hit Girl
<Dermathil> Ghosties, he's certainly funnelled his emotions through his hormones.
<RainBroDash> D:
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's entirely autotuned, before they even had autotune
<Elky> (no spoiling?)
<Silverscreen> 11I like those guys, personally.
<Roleplay4life> 5But
<Apokalipse> Ghosties is incredibly right
<Pyrate> Well.
<Sol> Flutterguy fte
<Roleplay4life> 5I mean like bands that thrived on live performances when they were staring
<Roleplay4life> 5**starting
<Guest8057456> In Kick Ass 2, one of those guys will become a "hero"
<Darf14> Random Encounter!
<drfsupercenter> 03well all those bands are going to die of old age soon
<Sol> I like Ned Flanders too
<Roleplay4life> 5like REO Speedwagon and CT and Rush and Journey and all those bands from that era. :3
<RainBroDash> @ghosties don't get me started on hit girl, ffs. I've hardly recovered from the moral dilemma in my head from last night surrounding hit girl
<Roleplay4life> 5THEY ARE IMMORTAL /shot
<drfsupercenter> 03granted, I've seen Weird Al twice, and he's good live
<RainBroDash> bastard
<Ghosties> 4One of the main character's friends becomes a "hero?"
<drfsupercenter> 03but even then, I prefer the album tracks
<Silverscreen> 11lol, RBD
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just for the crazy stuff he does on stage XD
<Ghosties> 4God
<Sol> He becomes an hero
<Guest8057456> yeah, he gets in the fad just for the fun of it
<drfsupercenter> 03I saw Trans-Siberian Orchestra live and was like meh, I'll stick to the CDs
<Ghosties> 4I don't think I would watch the second one
<HeavyMetalPony> They stole my comics!
<photoFINISHHIM> Sol, +1 internets to you
<RainBroDash> @ghosties, not at all?
<Roleplay4life> 5I know. :C But that's why I go to as many concerts as I can now. ^^; Live performance will soon be dead. /sigh
<drfsupercenter> 03no it won't
<Ghosties> 4Maybe if someone bought me a ticket or something
<Roleplay4life> 5All the GOOD live performances.
<drfsupercenter> 03as long as there are fangirls there will always be concerts
<Sol> $100 for a wetsuit?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just, now it's a squee competition
<Roleplay4life> 5By rock bands that are actually GOOD.
<drfsupercenter> 03well I';m not really a rock fan
<Bjornfot> darn, only 53
<HeavyMetalPony> no way, it's 99
<RainBroDash> @ghosties oh I thought you meant maybe like this, watching for free lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I like RockBand, though, ironically XD
<Elky> we can watch it at mbn
<Darf14> BRB, will come back after this scene
<drfsupercenter> 03I tend to like more techno/electronic stuff
<Elky> bmn*
<Apokalipse> HeavyMetalPony OBJECTION. It's 99.99
<Ghosties> 4Well, if Kick Ass 2 was picked for the BMN I would watch it because I'm a mod
<Roleplay4life> 5Synth rock? :3
<RainBroDash> RACISM
<Guest8057456> Oh yeah, and Kick Ass gets trained by Hit Girl to become a better fighter
<drfsupercenter> 03uh

<RaZor921> His last name is fucking Cage
<Roleplay4life> 5Eiffel 65 rocks for dance music.

<Sol> Goodily diddly call, baby doll
<Roleplay4life> 5That's why you have to research what bands are great live and which ones aren't. xD And only go to the good ones.
<Darf14> A true American that little girl is
<nomnomgiggity> over the line mark it zero
<Hipster_Brony> 8trolling successful
<Rellek> lol
<Silverscreen> 11This is a good example of how Cage's acting abilities depends on what role he gets.
<nukeiffum> I remember seeing that scene in the theater
<Dermathil> balisongs!!!
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Little girl confirmed for favourite character
<Silverscreen> 11He fucking owns in this role.
<nukeiffum> audience reaction was gold.
<Roleplay4life> 5Besides the only band I've actually had to shell out money to see is RUSH. All the others were free concerts and they were great.
<Ghosties> 4@Silver: Absolutely
<Hipster_Brony> 8Nick Cage is best actor
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't go to concerts XD
<Roleplay4life> 5(Most of 'em.)
<haganbmj> He's just fantastic in this.
<RainBroDash> @silverscreen I love him in this film
<photoFINISHHIM> yeah, because in some roles Nicholas Cage only has one facial expression
<Pyrate> >implying Cage doesn't kick ass all the times
<Roleplay4life> 5Even free ones?
<Dermathil> @Silverscreen: What Ghosties said.
<Pyrate> all of them
<drfsupercenter> 03uh

<RaZor921> I love Gone in 60 Seconds. Why? Cage
<drfsupercenter> 03those guys were amazing
<Sol> >implying Nick Cage is sometimes a bad actor
<Hipster_Brony> 8IMMA VAMPIRE
<Dermathil> how'd it get burn'd?!?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's one group that's better live than on the album
<Silverscreen> 11He's great here, but he wasn't that good in Ghost Rider.
<RainBroDash> A. B. C. D
<Ghosties> 4Oh come on, he kicked women's asses in The Wicker Man
<drfsupercenter> 03they're an interesting mix of classical and techno
<Elky> >implying nicolas cage has >1 facial expressions
<HeavyMetalPony> But seriously, best role since...well this is my favorite Cage role actually
<Ghosties> 4How is that not bad ass
<drfsupercenter> 03kinda like Daft Punk, but a lot more loud XD
<Roleplay4life> 5But do they have live albums? /eyebrow waggle

<Hipster_Brony> 8Son, I am disappoint
<Darf14> *sigh*.....yup I started bitching around here, so ill try to keep my mouth shut and restrain myself pointing out the plot holes
<SilverSonic|Live> :D
<SilverSonic|Live> at least its working now
<Pyrate> Let's just enjoy.
<Dermathil> Pyrate: Critical on his Constitution roll
<WhatPayne> daym this movie seems good
<Sathia> greatplan
<Pyrate> Ah, I see.
<nukeiffum> Random classical bgm for the win.
<Sol> Ogod, this scene
<Roleplay4life> 5http://www.therushforum.com/index.php?showtopic=9400&view=findpost&p=2323621 <---- My sort-of-review of the concert I saw last night if anyone cares. ^^;
<Sol> The horror ;_;
<Ghosties> 4There was one plot point that the film makers decided to leave out in relation to Big Daddy
<Ghosties> 4According to the original comic
<photoFINISHHIM> classical music: instantly makes you classy
<HeavyMetalPony> inb4 oh god
<Dermathil> OH MAN
<SirSprinkles> 6inb4 oatmeal
<Sol> inb4 WHY
<Roleplay4life> 5WALL OF TEXT lol... There's a reason my username is "CMWriter" over there.
<SilverSonic|Live> and drf, learn2notcomplain about that face :P
<Silverscreen> 11Oatmeal
<Darf14> The only time I hate change if it creates plotholes
<Elky> oatmeal?
<Silverscreen> 11This is now Pony Revelent.
<drfsupercenter> 03or lrn2notpissmeoff
<HeavyMetalPony> inb4 because the nuts are the best part of oatmeal
<Elky> sweet
<Hipster_Brony> 8and i said oatmeal, are you crazy?
<nukeiffum> Finish yer oatmeal.
<masterbate> guys i just joind to see if people were still here why is the movie still playing
<Elky> nuts in oatmeal? ARE YOU CRAZY?
<Sol> Oh, it's not this scene
<MonsieurLeFlour> Oatmeal is enjoyed with a few spoonfulls of apple sauce
<Sol> Fail
<Ghosties> 4But I actually agree that if they had kept that particular plot point from the comic it would have been detrimental to the film's solidity
<Dermathil> Ghosties, what plot point?
<SilverSonic|Live> learn2notcomplain about that face :P
<drfsupercenter> 03no.
<SilverSonic|Live> yes.
<Apokalipse> fan art
<HeavyMetalPony> Seriously, this is like the 97th greatest film of all time.
<Ghosties> 4Big Daddy wasn't a cop in the comic
<Dermathil> ah
<nukeiffum> Wasn't the comic book and the movie developed simultaneously?
<RainBroDash> oh really ghosties?
<Elky> you're all decadent, oatmeal doesn't have anything but oats and milk in it
<Dermathil> alrighty
<Ghosties> 4He was, in fact, just a regular nerd just like the main character
<Angel_Espeon> 13lrn2beneutral
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3c
<drfsupercenter> 03dare to be stupid
<Lati> 12... >>
<Elky> and maybe a little butter
<Dermathil> BALISONGS
<Sol> It'd be like symbolic or something
<Silverscreen> 11Ghosties: I think the cop aspect is cool.
<HeavyMetalPony> >implying you can't make oatmeal with water
<Pyrate> BUTTERFLY KNIVES!
<Ghosties> 4But he actually was this bad ass character
<RainBroDash> @ghosties fair, although I think i prefer this one. he has motive to be so uber badass
<MonsieurLeFlour> Future Spy
<Lati> 12... <<
*Hipster_Brony 8doesnt read comics, didnt know there was a comic of this movie
<Elky> she's a SPAH
<Apokalipse> also, in the movie he's nick cage
<Light_Latias> 12lolz song
<RainBroDash> @ghosties getoutofmyhead.tif
<Dermathil> We got the knife and the Familiar fez in one Show.
<Ghosties> 4When it does come to characters, I also enjoy this version of Big Daddy
<nukeiffum> She's so pro
<Ghosties> 4I mean hell, it's NICK CAGE
<Darf14> I personally like the cop aspect, I didn't like the comics version of big daddy
<Sol> I love this actress, why they make no more of her ;_;
<Espeon> 06what
<Lati> 12I find Weather to be a funny word today
<Angel_Espeon> 13Funny word of the day?
<RainBroDash> so many beaches
<HeavyMetalPony> hello? XD
<nukeiffum> She was in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie
<photoFINISHHIM> he has his OWN OFFICE?! oh wait XD

<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 12 minutes
<Dermathil> Spy knife
<Sol> NOW IT'S THIS SCENE
<HeavyMetalPony> Disappointed when she didn't rip off Patty's head
<Lati> 12JUICE
<Ghosties> 4She was also in "Let Me In"
<Soarin> magic, Elky
<Lati> 12thats the funny word of the day
<Dermathil> With the Familiar Fez
<Lati> 12LOL
<Darf14> Hey! I have that same microwave to cook my meals.
<Ghosties> 4And she WAS a vampire in the movie
<Elky> obviously
<MonsieurLeFlour> Reminds me of Gremnlins
<HeavyMetalPony> Ghosties: original was better
<Pyrate> Put it on 2 minutes.
<Pyrate> Five?
<drfsupercenter> 03but check that out Roleplay4life XD
<nukeiffum> lolthisscene
<Elky> or maybe magnets
<Ghosties> 4I never saw the original
<Hipster_Brony> 8interrogation fail in 3... 2... 1...
<photoFINISHHIM> Hungry Man dinner XD
<Ghosties> 4I wanted to though
<HeavyMetalPony> Ghosties: it's on Youtube if you want
<Espeon> 06:3
<Darf14> His radiation level is over 9000!!!
<Ghosties> 4I hate the Westernized title
<Sol> This is even worse if you know how microwaves work ;____________;
<Ghosties> 4Let Me In sounds so...
<Dermathil> BOOM!!!!!!
<RainBroDash> BOOOOOOOOOM
<Dermathil> HAAHB
<nukeiffum> rofl classical music
<MonsieurLeFlour> Did he died?
<Dermathil> PERFECT TIMING
<Darf14> aww....he didn't turn into a ghoul
<Ghosties> 4Let The Right One In sounds much better
<SpiritShine> so...how does it work? o3o
<Sol> No, he good
<HeavyMetalPony> God, physics class made this movie a lot more disturbing
<Elky> that wouldn't happen in a real microwave?
<Roleplay4life> 5That's pretty shweet~
<Lati> 12OH Angel
<Darf14> Mythbusters Proved that doesn't happen
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I know right
<Ghosties> 4What does happen then?
<Angel_Espeon> 13o-o
<photoFINISHHIM> lol, implied rape
<Lati> 12a kinda new gaia grant thing
<drfsupercenter> 03I bought their CD after I saw the concert but it wasn't that good
<Lati> 12http://www.gaiaonline.com/grant?key=hueyichooseyou
<Roleplay4life> 5I love the mix of instruments but the vocalist's work leaves much to be desired, just imo.
<Elky> you'd cook
<maxaminusone> You'd be steamed alive.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, I don't really like the vocals either
<Elky> er, be cooked
<Silverscreen> SMACK!
<Dermathil> Well, what happens when the water molecules in a body starts to vibrate?
<Roleplay4life> 5But it sounds a little better at about 1:00.
<drfsupercenter> 03there were some entirely instrumental onems
<drfsupercenter> 03*ones
<Sol> Microwaves causes water molecules inside food to vibrate fast enough to where it warms the food
<Elky> just like microwave food
<Lati> 12if you haven't got it already
<Ghosties> 4Ewwww
<HeavyMetalPony> Sure, but I know how it should've worked
<RainBroDash> the tray hit is amazing hahaha
<HeavyMetalPony> And then he choked to death
<Angel_Espeon> 13Awesome, thanks :3
<Sol> In other words, you'd be boiling from the inside of your own body
<maxaminusone> The first thing that would happen is you'd go blind.
<Roleplay4life> 5How many instrumentalists are up there? Five?
<maxaminusone> Cuz the optic nerve cant dissipate heat
<SilverSonic|Live> http://www.flickr.com/photos/enithepuppy/3460703766/ XD
<Ghosties> 4Sol: I will not forget those words for many nights to come
<nukeiffum> he so beta
<Ghosties> 4Thanks for that
<drfsupercenter> 03I think there's 4 plus the singer
<photoFINISHHIM> metal implants make you 20% cooler
<Dermathil> Well, I see food pop in my microwave all the time when it is put slightly too strong
<Roleplay4life> 5Hm.
<nomnomgiggity> hey - now that you've been raped i find you more attractive
<Sol> That's why it makes me ;______________;
<HeavyMetalPony> Peeps, but that guy
<drfsupercenter> 03around 4:20 is what I was talking about XD
<drfsupercenter> 03how they have the electronic part in there
<Dermathil> PhotoFINISHHim, you forget the fked up nervous system
<Sol> Although, you did ask :p
<Roleplay4life> 5I think too many and it starts to sound crowded. But four-five is good.
<Elky> he's just jealous
<RaZor921> Dermathil: I managed to pop chicken once
<Ghosties> 4I shouldn't have asked
<drfsupercenter> 03and at the actual concert it was like bass so loud you could feel it
<drfsupercenter> 03it was awesome
<Ghosties> 4I regret it now
<nukeiffum> Bitches and whores.
<Hipster_Brony> 8GHEY?!
<Apokalipse> Pop Scootaloo? Nooo

<Silverscreen> 11Coke is sweeter, Pepsi is healthier.
<photoFINISHHIM> group fights can be a bitch
<Darf14> He should have used lethal weapons
<Dermathil> CHILL IN THE SPINE FROM AWESOMENESS

<Roleplay4life> 5One time there was this girl trying to convince me that Adam Lambert was the greatest musician in the universe and I was like, "Dude, my fave band had released 9 albums by the time he was BORN."
<Elky> anyone know the name of this artist?
<Hipster_Brony> 8Coke is too sweet
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Pepsi... healthier....? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<HeavyMetalPony> >totally going to download soundtrack after this
<summerstorm> if your worried about health why would you get a soft drink?

<MonsieurLeFlour> Coke is 20% sweeter
<darky> do !cmds for a list of commands :P
<Sol> *hydrogenated
<Ghosties> 4I will say this though
<Silverscreen> 11HeavyMetalPony: Agreed. This soundtrack is awesome.

<RaZor921> The song is called Omen, by The Prodigy
<Rellek> awesoem shit
<RaZor921> In case someone wanted to know
<maxaminusone> They still make that?!?
<Darf14> I would use stealth to take out those guys
<photoFINISHHIM> I like how they're just watching instead of calling the cops
<Ghosties> 4God, I wish they still made Pepsi Blue
<Apokalipse> I feel sorry for you guys. You will never taste the awesomeness that is Cockta
<MonsieurLeFlour> Pepsi Blue?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Why do a lot of girls I know think Adam Lambert is good-looking :|
<SirSprinkles> 6Pepse Blue was AMAZING
<Hipster_Brony> 8Pepsi Blue was the worst soda in history
<SirSprinkles> 6*Pepsi
<summerstorm> yeah it was.
<Sol> NARM
<Ghosties> 4Pepsi Blue was a short lived product in the early 2000's
<MonsieurLeFlour> Don't think they sold that here
<SilverSonic|Live> o_O
<SirSprinkles> 6I can't brain today.
<Darf14> ah who am I kidding, I would probable get killed even if I used stealth
<Dermathil> New Cola was worse
<nomnomgiggity> Yus got balls kid *closes knife. yus got balls

*HyperMetalLugia flees
<Lati> 12Imagine
<HeavyMetalPony> Coffe Cola was the shit
<SirSprinkles> 6Natural sugar = healthier
<Darf14> What about that rip off Pepsi Vanilla?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> And it was AMAAAAAAZING
<MonsieurLeFlour> Most common phrase in the BMN chat: Dealwithit.jpg
<Lati> 12I don't think he is
<photoFINISHHIM> had to happen, bad soda is bad, and Crystal pepsi sucked
<DragonRage> Is this a bad time to say I love Vanilla Coke?

<nukeiffum> beta as fuck
<Hipster_Brony> 8LeFlour, not apart from the obvious ones like Batman and Superman
<Silverscreen> 11Scott Pilgrim is a movie, based off of a comic book, that parodies video games.
<Roleplay4life> 5There was an entire section in their documentary about their lack of fashion savvy-ness. "We desperately just wanted to wear jeans and a t-shirt..."
<masterbate> am i the only one that cant see the movie?
<Darf14> Wait, so since I know Scot Pilgrim I didn't sin....let me fix that.....I think the bat credit card is an awesome idea!
<Roleplay4life> 5...and now they do.
<haganbmj> And it's a good comic.

<SirSprinkles> 6HERRO THERE
<photoFINISHHIM> lol
<MonsieurLeFlour> Crap, missed the scene
<HeavyMetalPony> What a douche
<nomnomgiggity> bumblebee
<Ghosties> 4God, now I wanna play Heavy Rain
<Pyrate> Was that good Y/N?
<SpiritShine> ouch :/
<DragonRage> Thankfully I have my trust WordPad censor bar in case things get too... eugh for me.
<nomnomgiggity> uh
<DragonRage> trusy
<RainBroDash> hnng
<Silverscreen> 11Ditko
<photoFINISHHIM> OMG, earlier meme didn't do this justice
<DragonRage> trusty!
<Rellek> hnng
<Light_Latias> o.o
<Pyrate> Wait what?
<Silverscreen> 11Hell yeah, Ditko.
<Sol> >Benefits of being gay
<Sol> *playing gay
<RainBroDash> @rellek hnnnnnnnggg
<photoFINISHHIM> PRETEND TO BE GAY, STILL GET TO RUB DOWN NAKED CHICKS
<Light_Latias> but men singing high is yucky D:
<Bakphoon> I'm looking to see if I can get a band going with some friends, actually.
<Bakphoon> no u
<Elky> still?
<Hipster_Brony> 8sometimes i wish i were gay...
<Rellek> HNNNNNNNNNNNG
<HeavyMetalPony> :|
<Dermathil> Ghosties: read Pony Rain if you feel like playing that. The quality is through the roof.
<Elky> like... gay, but also straight...
<RainBroDash> I pull off gay really well.
<Pyrate> Aaaaaaaaw shit, son
<Roleplay4life> 5LL, unless they can actually pull it off and sound good, like Lee used to be able to.
<Ghosties> 4Huh, I see
<maxaminusone> Closest person to a real-life superhero - wikipedia Jack Churchill.
<RainBroDash> h8rz be h8in
<MonsieurLeFlour> Should I mimic Whelp and bring up the kinsley scale?
<photoFINISHHIM> still as in most times pretending to be gay wouldn't help get into people's pants
<Darf14> Fact: Girls don't really do this with their friends, unless they play for the other team
<Rellek> everyone thinks I'm gay anyways so lol
<Dermathil> No seriously. That fic was brilliant.
<Roleplay4life> 5Jon Anderson is another one that sounded pretty good singing high. (of Yes)
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol leflour
<Sol> Time for cell shader : D
<Light_Latias> o.o
<maxaminusone> In WWII he charged german beaches playing the bagpipes and then pulled out a claymore and started hacking people up
<Light_Latias> how high?

<Elky> Closest person to a real-life superhero - read about Theodore Roosevelt on Cracked.
<Roleplay4life> 5We're talking.. soprano, pretty much.
<HeavyMetalPony> Big Daddy is a rad artist too?
<Light_Latias> o.o
<Light_Latias> so falsetto
<Light_Latias> yuck
<Sol> Carry a big stick, like Teddy
<Bakphoon> I wouldn't say soprano.
<MonsieurLeFlour> Big Daddy multitasks
<Bakphoon> Alto, more like it.
<Ghosties> 4I'll take your word for it. Unfortunately, I don't read much fanfiction anymore
<Silverscreen> 11I want more motion comics like this.
<Roleplay4life> 5Alto I. (;
<Darf14> They did this to save money on acting and special effects
<Light_Latias> 17:15 Light_Latias so falsetto
<Elky> reminds me of kill bill
<Light_Latias> yuck
<Ghosties> 4You know, you'd probably like Repo! Silver
<Bakphoon> Still not usual men range.
<Ghosties> 4They have the same visual transition style like this
<Silverscreen> 11Repo! The Genetic Opera?
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<Silverscreen> 11Already have it.
<Light_Latias> it's strange lol
<Ghosties> 4Hah
<Roleplay4life> 5I don't know, Anderson sounded pretty legit in some of those songs. But maybe he was just really good at falsetto. /shrug
<Ghosties> 4It's good, isn't it?
<HeavyMetalPony> I read your comic, it sucked.
<Silverscreen> 11Yes, it is.
<DragonRage> Ooh! We should watch that sometime. Maybe. If we haven't already.
<Sol> Needed more Spider-Man
<Bakphoon> I can sing reasonably high somewhat well.
<Ghosties> 4You know, I wouldn't mind watching that in the BMN at some point
<Silverscreen> 11That, Little Shop of Horrors, and Sweenie Tood. :D

<Ghosties> 4Now do we
<SirSprinkles> 6I would if I could. The wifi here doesn't really let me.
<Roleplay4life> 5One of those was a terrible movie.
<HeavyMetalPony> Note to people who haven't seen this: This actually happens, the film shows this scene twice
<Roleplay4life> 5Guess which one. xD
<Elky> depends on the type of accident

<Dermathil> Ghosties: True, we only have cold accidents here.
<prince-dari> So did I miss anything important in the last week?
<photoFINISHHIM> eeyup
<Pyrate> There are a whole bunch of people masquerading as Kick-Ass
<DragonRage> Ah.
<SpiritShine> oh impersonater :|
<Ghosties> We have two potential new mods
<Roleplay4life> 5I squee'd when they played both YYZ and La Villa this last tour. xD
<Bakphoon> -.-- / -.-- / -..
<Sol> accidents with tomahawks
<Hipster_Brony> we started a steam group
<photoFINISHHIM> surprise! it was fake
<Bakphoon> wait
<Darf14> You never heard of Cos-Play Mr. Mobster
<Bakphoon> i messed that up
<SpiritShine> lol :D
<Hipster_Brony> and a steam group jacked our logo
<Bakphoon> -.-- / -.-- / --..
<HeavyMetalPony> Throw Kick Ass party...everybody dies...profit?
<RaZor921> Is it just me, or does it lag a lot?
<Ghosties> But, DCD wants to play nice with them.

<Roleplay4life> 5Have you heard the ESL version of that one?
<Ghosties> Even if it was fucked up of them to steal our logo
<Elky> well, that means a lot of leftover snacks
<Elky> so yeah, profit
<Sathia> its fine now (finally)
<Bakphoon> RP4L i know these people at school that try to play that on the drum whenever they get their hands on a drumstick and i don't think they ever get it right

<nukeiffum> ;^;
<Roleplay4life> 5Rush just isn't that popular with our generation. :C
<Darf14> Tony the Tiger! How could you!
<Ghosties> The gist of it is if Silver wants to do them a logo or not
<Bakphoon> except guitar hero
<Ghosties> Because that was DCD's plan
<Sol> Nuke: Tony = Tacowiz, though
<Roleplay4life> 5Lol yeah.

<nukeiffum> imokaywiththis.jpg
<Ghosties> 4He should name the bazooka "Control"
<RaZor921> Bazooka is the anti-tank weapon used during World War II by US Forces
<RaZor921> M1 Bazooka
<Darf14> You know your a soldier class if you use a Bazooka!

<Ghosties> 4Well, he is a crime lord
<Rellek> he's got a damn dojo of course he can fight
<DragonRage> I thought all he had going for him was a mean roundhouse.
<RaZor921> Actually, it's a Minigun, Gatling-type Machinegun
<Darf14> Dude, you have a jet-pack gatling gun! You can beat him in 10 seconds flat.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Latest TST member is called OOO, apparently

<maxaminusone> Flutteryshy is best pony
<Elky> wee
<HeavyMetalPony> CDI: Friendship is shitty software
<RaZor921> Fluttershy and Rarity are the best, together
<photoFINISHHIM> what is the url of this vid?
<Hipster_Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83_VxAjyfts
<Darf14> Pinkie Pie and Rainbow are the best pony
<RaZor921> I can't decide on which one
<Nittany_Tiger> Mah poni, this is what all great colts stride for?

<HeavyMetalPony> Sorry guys, I'm not old enough to be associated with the use of apples
<photoFINISHHIM> I went out and favorited that video
<Darf14> don't recognize the reference
<nukeiffum> RDR?
<Elky> go to bed hmp
<Dermathil> RPR
<Silverscreen> 11I see this and first thought is True Grit.
<Hipster_Brony> we have a number of people i know are Dash fans too
<WhatPayne> Marston, is that you?
<nomnomgiggity> lolol
<nukeiffum> I'd play it.
<Ghosties> 4I see this and first thought is "Man, I wish I had Red Dead Redemption"
<Elky> we should watch true grit at BMN, but it's a bit too recent
<Aeroslash> gonna get going for a bit
<Aeroslash> bbl~
<DragonRage> Likewise, Ghosties.
<insertcupcake> how ironic of trixie
<HeavyMetalPony> I see this and thought muffin
<Elky> unless we watch the original
<Silverscreen> 11Which version? Old or new?
<Bjornfot> 0It's highly overrated, Ghosties.
<Darf14> Wait....Its Red Dead Redemption right?
<RaZor921> I have RDR, and now I feel the sudden urge to replay it
<Sol> Needs more Magnets
<RaZor921> And yes
<prince-dari> LOL that's cool, I have one of them too.
<Ghosties> 4I've played and beaten RDR, Bjornfot
<Ghosties> 4And I absolutely loved it
<maxaminusone> I thought RDR was amazing.
<RaZor921> I agree with Ghosties
<Darf14> The ending is sad though
<HeavyMetalPony> lol
<RaZor921> It's amazing
<Silverscreen> 11Did they died?

<Hipster_Brony> 8Ghosties, u got a problem with Kanye?
<Ghosties> 4*puts obscure 90's music on*
<SpiritShine> its ok i'll love and tolerate ur opinion
<insertcupcake> this is something that can handle this power
<maxaminusone> SilkAMV made all the best parts of this video, he also made fuck shit stack. Sub him.
<Sol> just count the houwas
<Ghosties> 4I don't like modern rap/hip hop
<nukeiffum> No one mare should have all this pony.
<Ghosties> 4At all
<photoFINISHHIM> I find this video surprising lacking until the very end
<ChaoMagma> 4who here likes googol?
<Elky> Me neither, but PONIES
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont either for the most part
*Silverscreen 11wants to do a Last Airbender AMV with this song.
<RaZor921> Neither do I, Ghosties, but this song
<SpiritShine> nukeiffum, ahh too many posts at one time D:
<RaZor921> So awesome
<GabeMoist> I don't really like the music, but that picture is great\
<Ghosties> 4No
<Ghosties> 4Not even this song
<Hipster_Brony> 8with the exception of Kanye
<drfsupercenter> 03you're asking if we like a very large number?
<RainBroDash> ghosties me neither, it gets on my nerves so much. But I don't tell everyone I always mute this :3
<RaZor921> I agree with Hipster
<Ghosties> 4Well I do tell them
<Nittany_Tiger> Now I have movie ideas. I'm entering next week's lottery.
<RainBroDash> ha
<Bjornfot> 0rap=gay

<Dermathil> alright, full vid.
<nukeiffum> SpiritShine: PM system didn't work for you?
<Darf14> Two of everything! Its Noah's Ark all over again!
<Sol> >Only one who can tolerate rap
<HeavyMetalPony> HeavyMetalPony is okay with Silverscreen's potential AMV
<Sol> ;_;
<Potatojack> When you see the video it's based on, this matches it amazingly
<RaZor921> Now for the Jackass intro
<photoFINISHHIM> @Ghosties, most modern/pop music is over synthed shit anyway, many feel the same as you do
<ChaoMagma> 4yesh :)
<Elky> I don't mute, it's basic courtesy, you don't want others to mute your request
<nukeiffum> >only one who really enjoys rap
<RaZor921> This is the best thing ever
<ChaoMagma> 4do yuu?
<Ghosties> 4But seriously, I just can't tolerate modern rap/hip hop. It's all entertainment these days
<nukeiffum> >by obscure Japanese artists
<ChaoMagma> 4er, do you?
<nukeiffum> >>
<RainBroDash> Ghosties, modz be hatin' on controversially opinioned non-mods, so i stay silent :D
<Dermathil> How long does this last again? 24 minutes?
<Hipster_Brony> 8theres some other rap that i like, but nothing on the radio
<Nittany_Tiger> Old rap is good ('90s rap).
<Apokalipse> and here I thought people here would be more mature than to be homophobic Bjornfot
<Hipster_Brony> 8Das Racist is great
<Ghosties> 4I do like Flobots
*Silverscreen 11listens to anything, really. : /
<Nittany_Tiger> Most music died in 2000 IMHO.
<Darf14> Unless you really really want to perform that dangerous crap *skates down a highway*
<Ghosties> 4But they're more Alternative Hip Hop
<Sol> nukeiffum >and TPain

<Nittany_Tiger> Fucking Backstreet Boys.
<RaZor921> I love all kinds of music, but right now I'm in love with Queens of the Stone Age
<Hipster_Brony> 8Curren$y and Shabazz Palaces are solid too

<HaveTubaWillTravel> Girls on FIM
<maxaminusone> girls on film
<photoFINISHHIM> With the sheer amount of pieced together footage the Brony community has pieced together from the episodes I squee with delight at the thoughts of season 2 footage and what it will bring
<Dermathil> PIE
<insertcupcake> take a drink for every girls on film in that song
<Nittany_Tiger> I think it was '09

<insertcupcake> aha!
<RaZor921> Now I need to listen to In My Head... fuck
<Dermathil> MAXAMINUSONE GOT IT RIGHT
<Elky> in my head is not their best song though
<maxaminusone> XD
<RaZor921> It's the one I've been addicted to lately
*Hipster_Brony 8thinks that in my head was one of the weaker songs on that album

<Drake|TF2> 04feel free quan
<Roara|TF2> 6doesn't matter how nervous you are, that helps a ton
<RenegadeBrony> 0Red bull? Rainbow is already a pegasus, and awesome.
<Skylands> 10I don't have those :P
<drfsupercenter> 03and depending on how old the person is, show some clevage

<Drake|TF2> 04I've just been playing with bots because I suck
<Roara|TF2> 6k
<Hipster_Brony> 8if the answer is anything besides Rainbow Dash, it's wrong
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<Starflier> TRUEDAT!
<Roara|TF2> 6what's considered "nice" lol
<Quanyails> 7Hey, when NS sets up that server, we can all play together. :P
<RaZor921> My answer is my own
<RaZor921> Actually it's every pony in the mane cast
<Quanyails> 7Then you can see how fail I am. :P
<Dark_Horst> someone mentions horns cut off > interpret dick metaphor > think about hornjobs
<Skylands> 10Dress pants and a decent shirt
<Drake|TF2> 04...NS as is Ascendant or NightSeas?
<Silverscreen> 11Rarity Pony is best Pony.
<Bjornfot> 0LUNA is best pony!
<Roara|TF2> 6k
*Skylands needs to get those though
<Quanyails> 7Ascendent.
<Ghosties> 4How about
<Drake|TF2> 04sweet
<Skylands> 10All I have is T-Shirts mostly :P
<Dark_Horst> FANDOM, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
<Roara|TF2> 6yeah just make yourself more than presentable, jobs love that
<Ghosties> 4All ponies are best ponies
<Silverscreen> 11Luna is second best pony
<Errannar> tsk.. Fluttershy's stare owns Rainbow Dash any day
<Quanyails> 7NS - Ascendent. Night = NightSeas. :P
<RaZor921> To be honest, I'm starting to love Rarity more than the rest
<Roara|TF2> 6the more casual, the less likely you get the job
<Starflier> Dark_Horst> Rainbow dash is awesome...
<RaZor921> So I'd actually agree with Silver
<Dermathil> Silly Silver, that's not how you spell Zecora
<Potatojack> Awesome music, Rainbow
<Starflier> is it true Rainbowdash is lesbo? IS IT?
<SirSprinkles> 6Rarity is best pony. Deal.
<Drake|TF2> 04ah
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't really have any clothes that are considered "smart" LOL
*Quanyails 7lols:
<Dark_Horst> i never said anything else
<Ghosties> 4Yes Starflier
<Angel_Espeon> 13so it took me forever to find something decent
<RaZor921> Zecora's no pony
<Drake|TF2> 04Roara
<Quanyails> 7There's a person named Inception about Dream World. XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8starflier: nope.avi
<Silverscreen> 11Luna's placement on being best pony depends on how she is in S2
<Starflier> Rarity is not best....UNLESS SHES SECOND BEST :d!
<Drake|TF2> 04I love how our nicks are the same length
<Dermathil> (Yes, I know my steam avatar is a RD one. I just can't find a Zecora one in the meantime)
<Espeon> 06lol
<RaZor921> My Steam avatar is a Fluttershy one

<Elky> doesn't overlap
<Ghosties> 4Scrumdiddlyumptious
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've either got really casual clothes (takes up 98% of all my clothes lol) or really formal clothes
<Ghosties> 4It's not very hard
<Roara|TF2> 6drake, quan, what are your steam names
<Quanyails> 7<
<Angel_Espeon> 13formal includes prom dress, which I hate wearing :|
<Quanyails> 7And a guy named Jeffx on DW. XD

<Starflier> *gets out of here*
<Bjornfot> 0mfw communism
<Roara|TF2> 6I'll try and track down a decent server
<nukeiffum> HOW DOES HE STAY IN BUSINESS?
<Ghosties> 4If someone touches you in a place or a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, that's good
<RaZor921> Exactly
<RenegadeBrony> 0I approve of this ability, Silverscreen.
<Quanyails> 7Wait for me, I'm almost done. :P
<Ghosties> 4So, what do you do?
<Dermathil> Sounds like Fallout: Equestria got updated. For all those who are interested.
<SirSprinkles> 6RaZor921: Yeah, and then the poor kid comes by and has to pay. XD
<Roara|TF2> 6as for clothes, I have mostly casual, but a fair amount of formal clothes
<Starflier> Rainbowdash backwards is hsadwobnair
<HaveTubaWillTravel> RaZor: When the Golden Tickets get announced, he'll make back the millions he lost in freebies

<Ghosties> Hey, Silver, what do you think about a Nick Cage special weekend in October? Wicker Man and Vampire's Kiss?
<Potatojack> Chuck Norris would be Celestia's dad.
<RaZor921> Chuck Norris isn't a very good actor
<Roara|TF2> 6I didn't ask for standard

<Roara|TF2> 6lost it
<Feather> 10no
<Lios> Silly Derpy.
<Silverscreen> Cool. :D
<HaveTubaWillTravel> The reason Celestia and Luna are princesses, not queens, is because they know Chuck Norris is the only true King.
<RainBroDash> ANIMANIACS
<Roara|TF2> 6Feather. FEATHER.
<Quanyails> 7Eh, I'll go with CP. Or maybe Payload.
<Feather> 10Aurora. AURORA.

<RaZor921> Fluttershy's Plot
<Starflier> ponies rhyme with bronies which rhymes with homies which rhymes with ponies...its a vicious cycle
<Drake|TF2> 04Roara
<Dark_Horst> chuck norris can't get into equestria. equestria is a mciro universe he once farted.

<ChaoAqua> 2Feather! long time no chat
<RaZor921> WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU RARITY?!!
<HaveTubaWillTravel> What is the art of the dress?
<prince-dari> This is pretty cool.
<Silverscreen> 11...that background is horrid.
<Starflier> WE ARE ALL HOMIEBROPONIES (created a meme right there :D)
*Sol starts fistpumping
<Dermathil> HEADBOB EVERYBRONY!!!
*Nittany_Tiger is listening to Nirvana
*Quanyails 7restarts said Steam.
<RenegadeBrony> 0Rarity, close your mouth.
<RaZor921> Rarity looks horrid
<Dark_Horst> this video needs a klingon to her left
<Elky> who made this song btw?
<Feather> 10must be cause I dunno who you are o.o
<Starflier> *headbobs*
*RainBroDash is listening to DJ Fresh again.
<Lios> Haddaway
<Starflier> *headphones fall off* DANGIT!
<Silverscreen> 11and that black wood look underneath the gold DJ stand does NOT work.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Agreed Silverscreen. Rarity would be ashamed of putting red against her purple hair
<Dermathil> "WHAT IS LOVE?"
<ChaoAqua> 2er, Quan? any specific pokeball? Perish Ball? :P
<RaZor921> This song is pure nostalgia to me
<Elky> lol I dunno
<RaZor921> I listened to it A LOT when I was a kid
<ChaoAqua> 2and YUU DON'T REMEMBER ME!!1???!!?
<SirSprinkles> 6I feel like a DJ, sitting in this cafe headbobbing with my giant headphones.
<Starflier> got my nephew to headbang 2 :D
<Angel_Espeon> 13The awkward moment where your friend forgets who you are
<ChaoAqua> 2:(
<Silverscreen> 11Razor921: NIght at the roxbury? :D
<Quanyails> 7Cherish Ball for Darkrai, hmm... Dive Ball for Latios.
<RaZor921> Nope
<Dark_Horst> i am sorry, but i always hated that song
<RaZor921> The song itself aired on radio
<Dark_Horst> kinda annyong
<Quanyails> 7Cherish Ball for Deoxys, and any ball for Arceus. :P
<Dark_Horst> am i evil?
<prince-dari> Put ponies into song, somehow it becomes good.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm still proud of the fact I got Kyogre in HG in a great ball
<Dermathil> Night at the Roxbury actually inspired the original trollface.
<Bjornfot> 0Don't Eat the Mushroom, anyone?
<RaZor921> I remember when we were on a car trip to Italy, this song played about 7 times or so
<Dermathil> The more you know...
<Potatojack> And forty bronies all headbob at once.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Colour coordination ftw
<Feather> 10Dive Ball for Latios? wtf?
<Quanyails> 7Actually, Premium Ball for Arceus.
<Silverscreen> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGvZa3tiYwY
<Starflier> my head hurts, make it stop
<Quanyails> 7I like it since it's blue and its nice exit effect.

<RaZor921> Anyone played Assassin's Creed 2?
<RainBroDash> potatojack I'm bobbing, but to drum n bass :L

<GabeMoist> WAT IS PONY\

<Feather> 10all my pokemon are in regular pokeballs LOL
<SirSprinkles> ...god that is hella long.
<Roara|TF2> 6no
<Feather> 10breeding ftw?
<Starflier> that would be epic
<RenegadeBrony> 0PMV's have introduced some of my brony friends to music they would have otherwise never heard or gotten into, so yes Ponies+Song does indeed = good idea.
<Roara|TF2> 6whats your name there
<Bjornfot> 0Really, Silverscreen? You a Nifflas fan?
<Quanyails> 7<
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe o

<mib_qg1pzn> banjo's are epic
<Elky> I prefer flutes personally
<Dermathil> Hey, should someone message Sethisto about the movie in 15 minutes?
<Starflier> banjos are epic when use in the appropriate situation
<Dermathil> needs MOAR FLUTES
<RaZor921> I prefer Violins, but that's beside the point

<prince-dari> I had it looped the whole day.
<SirSprinkles> Please say yes.
<mib_qg1pzn> yeah I'm gonna go play TF2 I don't really like Independence day enough to suffer it tonight, I'll probably be back later though

<Lolipop-of-Doom> But i ment really.
<Hipster_Brony> nope
<Dermathil> wait, oshit I be scared. WIll I even remember at the end of the summer that I don't have hoofs but hands?
<prince-dari> I wasn't at the computer all the time though, but it was still playing. XD
<RaZor921> I'm going to bed when Independence Day starts
<SirSprinkles> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<Elky> I think me too
<Dermathil> DCD, I heard the movie was as bad as the original in the trilogy. Was that true?
<Potatojack> By the end of summer you will have hooves.
<nukeiffum> dis loop
<Colgate> Today, I bought a Rainbow Dash KEYCHAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<mib_qg1pzn> nice

<Silverscreen> ?
<Silverscreen> well...
<Silverscreen> Shit.
<mib_qg1pzn> I think I'm gonna go order a Aj keychain...maybe
<RenegadeBrony> 0Colgate, you rock, woohoo.

<GabeMoist> found it
<prince-dari> You got the best pony too.
<RaZor921> I've yet to find any MLP-related merchandise in my area
*Silverscreen 11has a Twilight Toy. :P
<Starflier> Colgate Gained 500 reputation with Starflier (+50 rainbowdash bonus!)
<Dermathil> Alright. 'Cause Moviebob is my #1 movie critic that I listen to and he said that the movie is as bad as the others. Aka the movies should be about the robots not the humiez
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Me neither, RaZor. But with the show coming out here in a couple of days... hopefully...
<RaZor921> Need to check Toys 'R' Us next time I'm in town
<Colgate> I had to choose between Dash or Pinkie, then I figured Dash was about 20% cooler so yeah
<mib_tqg6tu> fuck moviebob
<mib_qg1pzn> I'd get a toy but the Applejack ones suck
<RainBroDash> @dari I watched the 10 hour video of nyan cat followed by the 10 hour Caramelldansen repeat once. It was an odd day
<mib_tqg6tu> that guy is awful
*Hipster_Brony 8needs Dash related merchandise badly
<prince-dari> LOL RainBroDash.
*Nittany_Tiger will order any MLP merchandise online.
<mobileDCD> it's my favorite of the three thus far
<mobileDCD> Then again to me these movies are the equivalent of TF2: ignore the excuse plot, watch for the fun
<Sol> Moviebob's review came out?
<Nittany_Tiger> Hipster_Brony: Same
<Dermathil> yeah
<GabeMoist> what happened with Colgate
<Dermathil> on friday
<Lolipop-of-Doom> It's Time.
<RaZor921> If someone asks me if I'm buying it for my sister or something, then I'll just look them straight in the eye and say "No"
<Elky> it's 2
<Starflier> *dances*
<RainBroDash> good on you RaZor :P
<Sol> Must have missed due to BMN (not a bad thing though, hehhehheh)
<Dermathil> Sol, he trashes it as much as he did the others.
<RaZor921> This video, who made it?
<mib_qg1pzn> Razor you had better
<Colgate> God, I had this on for 20 minutes a few hours ago..!
<MonsieurLeFlour> Hipster_Brony: I got a good one ogg eBay. See if you can get one at a decent price.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> RaZor is officially 20% cooler than me
<MonsieurLeFlour> off*
<mobileDCD> it was the most apocalyptic of the three, too
<mobileDCD> It also gave me a badass idea for a game, too bad I can't make games
<maxaminusone> Kespainify made this video, I think.
<DashAttack> Dash squeak is why this song is awesome
<Starflier> anyone here watch the MLP today?
<prince-dari> Someone got the link to what's on now?
<Colgate> I do
<Starflier> or recorded it if they can
<Dermathil> Also the only thing that could make him happy about the movie industry now (he's bored of it WAY too early in the year already) is Captain America.

<Sol> *48 of us

<maxaminusone> No air.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Starflier: Not intentionally
<Ghosties> 4It's my job to be here
<Hipster_Brony> 8starflier: its an action-comedy
<nukeiffum> Isn't this a Micheal Bay film?
*Espeon hugs Angel_Espeon :3
<Silverscreen> 11There's no wind either.
<prince-dari> Could we discuss some stuff after the film?
<RainBroDash> Silverscreen all is goood <3
<Axel_Foaley> Roland Emmerich
*Angel_Espeon hugs back~
<Ghosties> Something wrong, dari?
<Nittany_Tiger> ^
<Potatojack> We are awesome that way, Bjornfot.
<Hipster_Brony> like what?
<Colgate> This clip is questioning our intelligence!
<schro> it's a cultural thing, some people decided it'd be a good idea and eventually it got to the point where people just don't want to disappoint their parents and shit
<Silverscreen> ?
<Hipster_Brony> we can discuss during
<Nittany_Tiger> I love his disaster movies though 2012 needs improvement.
<prince-dari> Nah, just want to talk about getting a website up among other things.
<SirSprinkles> 6SOUND RAPE
<maxaminusone> Omg Loud OST is loud
<Ghosties> Ah
<Axel_Foaley> Weird how Roland gets americans better than Bay does.
<Colgate> So what the heck are we watching now?
<RainBroDash> Ghosties I'm sorry dude, accept my brohoof and apology my 'murrican brethren?
<Bjornfot> 0potatojack... that's exactly what i'm talking about. i'm facehoofing so hard
<Axel_Foaley> Poor sound quality =/= Ear rape.
<nukeiffum> rofl this song
<Dermathil> O.O SETI
<Starflier> EPIC SOGN ALERT
<Hipster_Brony> yeah, i can do that
<Dark_Horst> why so silent suddenly?
<Ghosties> 4*brohoof, my fine fellow who lives across the pond*
<Dermathil> They are supposed to have lost funding
<DragonRage> I love this song.
<SirSprinkles> Oh guys, this is something I just randomly thought up the other day...
<Ghosties> 4All is fine now
<Potatojack> :)
<Starflier> BUT does it need to be an Asian?
<Nittany_Tiger> I think SETI was originally defunded.
<Colgate> Yo bronies, what movie is this
<GabeMoist> Worldend
*RainBroDash brohoofs Ghosties
<Sol> This movie needed more fish
<Ghosties> 4Except that we're all gonna die in a while
<Ghosties> 4You know
<nukeiffum> niiiice haircut
<Ghosties> 4Will Smith and all
<Axel_Foaley> Black people can't can't be signals analysts
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Is that some Uncle Phil?
<Dermathil> HAHA
<maxaminusone> If the spaceships had made it that close already SETI wouldn't really be doing it's job.
<RainBroDash> fucking woll smoth
<schro> what could that possibly mean to him
<Potatojack> We are a whole nation of Rainbow Dashs, for better or worse.
<SirSprinkles> I was thinking once we're really up and running, like, full staff of mods and whatnot, we should do a classic movie month, with a single movie each day. We'd still be able to do our regular streams too.
<schro> "beep beep beep beep"
<Ghosties> 4Holy fuck, HTWT is right
<schro> "OH GOD"
<Ghosties> 4It's WHITE Uncle Phil
<Colgate> What is the movie´s name?
<Bjornfot> 0IT'S FROM EQUESTRIA
<nukeiffum> Niiiice coordination.
<Silverscreen> 11I honestly am quite embarrassed by how America is nowadays. Particularly with how greedy it's damn government's become. I prefer to think of Independance Day as a means of celebrating the golden days of American Culture.
<Axel_Foaley> So bald + grey beard = Uncle Phil?
<Ghosties> 4Golden days?
<Sol> We had golden days?
<Silverscreen> 11Yes, golden days.
<nukeiffum> news to me.
<Hipster_Brony> that would be interesting
<Nittany_Tiger> Silverscreen: Mother fucking agreed.
<Bjornfot> 0>implying america ever had any "culture"
<Ghosties> 4Wouldn't that be in the days of the American Revolution?
<Dermathil> Well, that's their fault if they thought separating from Britain was a good idea
<Zanzi> What golden days?
<DeadlyPony> The 90's
<Starflier> Silverscreen gained 5000 reputation with Starflier, but lost 9999 reputation with the united states government
<Ghosties> 4You know
<Axel_Foaley> Silverscreen I agree
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, inb4 SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<maxaminusone> I thought that was the 1960s
<Hipster_Brony> might be hard during the school year though
<SirSprinkles> Yeah.
<Ghosties> 4When we were trying to establish ourselves and all that?
<Colgate> Space, must go to space... I love space
<Potatojack> The 80s
<Hipster_Brony> 8inb4 moonbase alpha
<Sol> It's a space station
<schro> everyone, look at the blinking lights!
<CharlesAppleJackson> I'm here everypony, you can commence worshipping me now.
<prince-dari> AEIOU
<prince-dari> AEIOU
<prince-dari> AEIOU
<Dermathil> SHHHH
<GabeMoist> That's no moon
<SirSprinkles> This is something WAY long term I'm thinking.
<Bjornfot> 0I'm not hating or anything, but I just REALLY REALLY don't get why you Americans think you're so awesome.
<RainBroDash> silverscreen I refuse to think about the state of the world, it gets me really worked up about life and how inappropriately a lot of people live theirs, forever screwing everyone else over
<DeadlyPony> ...Duh, cause we ARE
<Axel_Foaley> WHOA, ROBERT LOGGIA
<Nittany_Tiger> USA now needs another revolution.
<SirSprinkles> Like... this time next year, hopefully.
<Ghosties> 4"If this isn't a beautiful woman..." "JOHN, IT'S ME"
<CharlesAppleJackson> Bjorn, I don't think I'm better than anyone.
<prince-dari> Meh, generalising like that is a bit unfair Bjornfot.
<Ghosties> 4"UH, UH, FIRST LADY"
<DeadlyPony> And plus, we have a holiday celebrating our foundig, and it is awesome
<Dermathil> They need an egoboost to even wake up in the morning. That's why.
<Colgate> God these american arguments are getting so last year
<Sol> Ew
<prince-dari> Some people probably do that, but a lot also don't.
<schro> man why do you stupid damn foreigners always lump the people who live in america together
<ChaoMagma> 4back
<Aishimasho> Bjorn, I wonder why everyone from another country always assumes every American is a certain way
<Silverscreen> 11RainBroDash: And that's why the concept of bronies is so special It shows that small percent that isn't like the rest.
<ChaoMagma> 4that took longer than expected
<Sol> Hahaha, a white president
<Ray> 02!shipping
<Skylands> 4 Ray is paired with ChaoMagma
<Colgate> Arguing over the internet is like running the special olympics, even if you win you are still retarded!
<Ghosties> 4Can you imagine a white president?
<Ghosties> 4Pfft
<DeadlyPony> OOOOO!!!
<SirSprinkles> 6I personally think America blows, but whatever chance I get to flaunt that I'm awesome. :p
<Hipster_Brony> 8wait, white president in a disaster day?
<Silverscreen> 11A WHITE PRESIDENT?! STOP THE PRESSES!
<RenegadeBrony1> My stream just derped; had to reload, and it says my nickname is already in use, this makes me a sad pony.
<Lati> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Lati, you are a 7Cacturne.
<DeadlyPony> OH SNAP!
*ChaoMagma 4is tires
<Lati> 12no
<Hipster_Brony> 8movie*
<ChaoMagma> 4*tired
<Bjornfot> 0because of movies like this, aishimasho
<Dark_Horst> well, because that's just the way hoe americans represent themselves to the outside ALL THE TIME
<Aishimasho> Do you realize many of us laugh at the Europeans for their violence and riots over soccer? That doesn't apply to every European though
<Hipster_Brony> 8what the fuck was i typing
<Axel_Foaley> Yeah yeah and "opinions are like asshole"
<nukeiffum> WHERE'S OBAMA?
<Axel_Foaley> "give 110%"
<nukeiffum> WE NEED A BLACK PRESIDENT.
<CharlesAppleJackson> hipster_brony lolidunno.jpg
<Axel_Foaley> "I don't so mondays"
<SirSprinkles> 6You should be able to nickchange back to your regular name, RenegadeBrony1
<Axel_Foaley> *do* lol I can't type
<DeadlyPony> Too much COMPIMISE!
<Dermathil> They fantasize they are awesome because they feel so shitty in real life. (look at all those who lost their jobs. I heard that america was the country that lost the most jobs in the Financial crisis)
<DeadlyPony> ...Compimse
<Ghosties> A single movie each day?
<DeadlyPony> ...
<SirSprinkles> Yeah.
<Ghosties> That's kinda pushing it, don't you think?
<prince-dari> If you DC on IRC, sometimes your nick stays connected, because the server usually checks that you are still connected every 120 seconds.
<Aishimasho> So you judge a culture by it's entertainment media? That doesn't sound like a flawed methodology at all
<Potatojack> Enough politics, let's start blowing crap up.
<Ghosties> For the people in school in all
<DeadlyPony> Booohm
<SirSprinkles> Again, WAY down the line.
<GabeMoist> Get The Doctor!
<Bjornfot> 0It's Luna coming home!
<Dark_Horst> NOW the shits starts cookin.... and i don't mean the movie
<prince-dari> So in that time your nick should disconnect.
<Ghosties> Like myself
<Silverscreen> 11PotatoJack: Agreed.
<SirSprinkles> And during this time of year.
<RenegadeBrony> Thanks, I don't what happened.
<Dermathil> FIRE IN SPACE
<Axel_Foaley> We need Space Squids to unite The World
<nukeiffum> dat audiorape
<Axel_Foaley> BOOSH!!
<maxaminusone> Ear rape.
<prince-dari> Or if you have registered your nick you can use the ghost command to kill it.
<DeadlyPony> And then, three nuclear blasts happened
<Ghosties> Well, how many mods are you talking about?
<Sol> Those wave peaks
<SirSprinkles> A full staff.
<Ghosties> And a full staff is?
<RainBroDash> oh yeah prince-dari i know. but A LOT of people will dick over anyone and everyone for a bit more money. shit like 'health and safety claims' and you hear cases about people getting sued for 'touching children inappropriately' after rescuing them from drowning in a lake, just makes me sick dude
<Silverscreen> 11That's chaos theory.
<RainBroDash> i'd rather not think about it
<Dermathil> who's that actor again?
<Colgate> HEY! Isn´t that the guy from Jurassic Park?!
<SirSprinkles> Iunno. I was thinking probably around 20 total.
<Silverscreen> 11Jeff Goldbloom.
<DeadlyPony> Steve Gutenbrg
<Ghosties> Damn, that's quite a lot
<Sol> Jeff Goldblum
<DeadlyPony> ...
<Dark_Horst> yeah. he failed in j-park
<maxaminusone> Satellites have hydrazine in them, it's nasty stuff.
<SirSprinkles> It is.
<DeadlyPony> Darn, was close
<Dark_Horst> actually, he
<Axel_Foaley> um uhhh umm Jeff Goldblum
<SirSprinkles> But expansion is good.
<Dark_Horst> he'S a horrible actor most of the time
<Dark_Horst> in general
<SirSprinkles> And obviously I don't expect to need them all at once.
<RockLobster> sry i just came in
<DeadlyPony> Checkmate o3o
<Hipster_Brony> lets not get ahead of ourselves right now
<RockLobster> wats this movie
<Sol> So, NC?
<Ghosties> For one, we'd have to have quite a bit of half-ops considering Bristle, and Peanut don't ever really make it to the streams or meetings that much
<maxaminusone> You're a fucking psycho, Jeff Goldblum.
<RockLobster> whats this movie calleddddddddddd
<Colgate> Ah yes, haha, I rock! I do have to admit I liked him in the jurassic park movies, and even more in the book
<SirSprinkles> Well, I'm counting half-ops in that.
<Botuts> that voice XD
<Ghosties> Also
<Starflier> My nephew got his hand stuck behind my bed :D!!!
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I'm Harvey Fierstein and I'm the gay stereotype
<Dark_Horst> dude, that was the most horrible acting performance i ever saw
<GoldenDragon> that voice is the best voice
<Axel_Foaley> Harvey Fierstein?
<Ghosties> I think we should have shown The Patriot instead
<Colgate> He sounds like the short dude from Mulan
<Dermathil> BIKING IN OFFICE, DISREGARD SAFETY REGULATIONS
<charmin> o hai guiz
<Silverscreen> 11the-the-the way you, way you impersonate Jeff Goldblum, you see, you SEE, is to repeat and stutter on words, words, and give the wrong emphasis on CERTAIN words as-as well.
<DeadlyPony> I SMOKED A THOUSAND MARLBOROS!
<Sol> It's the guy from Mulan!
<Ghosties> Hmmm
<Ghosties> Maybe we can just show it for the next 4th of July
