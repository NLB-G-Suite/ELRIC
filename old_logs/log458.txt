<Rainbow> :P
*Michael is so happy
<PONY> GilDash, I'm not even sure do I have actual insurance at all, but at least the oven should have a guarantee

<PONY> GilDash, but that's sort of an insurance, right?
<drf|laptop> 03yeah this show sucks now
<GilDash> PONY: Well... I'm not sure that cooking things the oven was not designed to cook will necessarily count on the contract. :D
<drf|laptop> 03just like SpongeBob >_>
<TheRainbowDash> Michael: I wub to wub ponies and lick them also.
<panda> NewDCD: ah I se ^^ I would love to see your work though

<cachi01> thththats all folks
<GilDash> PONY: And it's a cover for the oven only, no additional damage. It could burn your house down, but you'd only get money for the oven.
<WallDives> WindWhistler: yes, its a fighting game, but we're looking at the joke endings.

<Magical_pablez94> panda: :D
<GilDash> PONY: Regardless, the warranty covers the oven only. No additional damage. If the microwave fell you *might* be able to get that replaced on warrranty too. As for the rest of it... no insurance? No payout.
<VDXRetrotainment> Peoplemostly want to see the flashy stuff of Blazblue, WELL here you go! XD
<Midnight_Tempest> kirzstryfe: im installing it now, we can after its done
<DuskStarshimmer> kirzstryfe, you guys getting a game lobby together?

<RAWRity> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: porn probably
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Dken2021: ok lol
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Please try and stay up until then even if it kills you. Then try and sleep until 08:00 the following day, again, even if it kills you. This might take several days but you *will* fall back into a good sleep habit.

<Litwick> I fail to understand how Samurai Cop can't be shown here, yet Game of Thrones (a show with nudity and sex in EVERY EPISODE) can be shown almost daily.
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: no.. im most likely staying up till 6 am anyways xD
<Kurra|Biking> Hi all and laters. :)
<Airpuff> GilDash: You do? Really?
<AppleEric> is this WoW?
<GilDash> Airpuff: Why does nobody on this chat know how to sleep? :D

<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: We have that in Game of Thrones as points.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3that's why it was pulled

<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Even considering that most games nowadays are re-hashes of a previous title and still sold at FULL price.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TheRainbowDash: I just hate the business practices that are common with major titles now.

<TheRainbowDash> Nittany_Discord: Ah, that is what I was trying to go for, about big gaming corpertaions. And even of such that doesn't release games, such as IGN and G4, they are getting a little bias and mainstream also with these of big releases.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Profit and IP control.
<|Discord|> That is not a channel
<FlareChaser> kirzstryfe: wrong ping

<Airpuff> What was the name of the video? Anyone?! xD
<|Discord|> CoD and Halo are bad games. TF2 is sooo mcuh better
<FlareChaser> Halo is fun as hell, yeah its a FPS, but the gameplay is different.
*flutter_shy is trolling in a video
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Sumica: areu gonna stream it like sunday early morning?
<TheRainbowDash> Hello SmileDashie! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
<derpy_pony> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0763500/ b movie. looks better than the a one
<FlareChaser> TF2 is best FPS though.
<cowvarkian> ikr FlareChaser
<RosePetal> I saw that too.
<TheRainbowDash> Oh god, Call of Duty internet fight..(sighs):|
<Golakka> I took a freighter full of livestock and exotic dancers into auga :p

<OmegaMetroidBrony> I need a footstool.... where's my mobile school locker...
<Fluttershyfan158> has anyone ever seen or read the hunger games?
<Obsidian> Whos talking?
<derpy_pony> I looked cheap
<Dken2021> in a half hour Nabronyan
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nope Fluttershyfan158
<FlareChaser> Where are they streaming? D:!
<alexxm> it looks more like a ps2 game
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<RosePetal> I read it but i have not seen the movie :(
<Skylands> 10Not seeing other seasons
<RosePetal> More like a ps1 game.

<|Discord|> Biglaw: That is my question...
<Woodenfan> hmmmmmmmmmm
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dunno. You can't knock franchises.
<Skylands> 10Samurai Jack, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Power Puff, back when CN was cool
<Biglaw> sammicer most certainly not! MLD is a sad story, not cruel
<Woodenfan> shadow spinarak you're mine
<Sebiale> No Golakka, Torchlight looks like Diablo.
<Skunkurn> 08,01oh hey Golakka
<Biglaw> sammiver most certainly not! MLD is a sad story, not cruel
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If you judged MLP for being a franchise cash-out...
<Obsidian> I think the timer is off by an hour
<Golakka> No, Torchlight looks radically different to D2
<Ninjazz> sammiver: It's probably the completel opposite.
<Biglaw> Soooo
<Ersatz> Torchlight is more Diablo-like than D3.
<GabeMoist> What do I do? http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/3724/downzd.png

<TheRainbowDash> Hmm Alicorn_Prince_Shane?
<RosePetal> i KNOW! they just don't give up.
<Saturn> 08,01looks similar to Baldur's Gate
<Sebiale> Graphics might be similar, but the aesthetics between D3 and Torchlight are quite different.
<sammiver> how many mlp seasons are they?

<FlareChaser> Nittany_Discord: you never say hi to me :|

<dshannon> and the whole "post" apocalyptic zombie down
<TheRainbowDash> Uncharted kart racing? No way Total Halibut....:D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This is a Sony-only game? Online passes ahoy!
<Golakka> Naughty Dog made crash bandicoot! This game is gonna be awesome
<alexxm> this game looks good
<Fluttershyfan158> i never knew Angry Joe was a brony!!
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs FlareChaser
<RosePetal> Is it about zombies?
<SpiitFiire> GilDash: See ya in a bit :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sorry. Didn't see your message.
*Skylands forces juhn1024-XD to dance to hamsterdance jingle.
<GilDash> SpiitFiire: Aye. :)
<dshannon> it has them apparently
*FlareChaser hugs Nittany_Discord back
<Fluttershyfan158> isn't doug walker a brony?
<Dken2021> Fluttershyfan158 I'm not sure if he is
<Skylands> 10Unrelated song and TV show, tho
<Ninjazz> Made by the same people who brought Uncharted <3
<alexxm> where did he say that Fluttershy158
<RosePetal> Not sure.
<Fluttershyfan158> he didn't
<RosePetal> I know Cinema snob's wife likes mlp.
<sergio_scriptor> Fluttershyfan158: he said he liked the show and though it was funny,but that he did not like itt brony level
<Skylands> 10Now I know what writer's block feels like
<junh1024-XD> oh
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: I wub that series so much, much deserving and granting of awards and stuff, and it already has. However, I think that Uncharted 3 should've won Game of the Year for 2011.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Was that game they're talking about called something else earlier in development? 'Cause it reminds me of something else that hasn't been released yet.
<RosePetal> Ok.
<Fluttershyfan158> who did scriptor??
<junh1024-XD> ┐('～`；)┌
<drf|laptop> 03well I don't like "cute" shows
<sergio_scriptor> Him
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd be interested in this game, but I know an online pass is coming, so interest is dead.
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: INDEED!
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Did it have something to do with a some kind of poison gas?
<Skylands> 10You need more cute in your life then
<pyrocatboy> Seems like those people that were attacking those two, it might be that its something like a rage vires.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: On the surface I meant.
<Fluttershyfan158> who liked it AJ or Doug Walker?
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Doesn't it suck, sticking to principals? :D
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Ah, quite..(sips cider on my 1 million dollar leather chair, in my private estate, with my suit and what not):D
<sergio_scriptor> Doug walker
<Fluttershyfan158> doug said he liked it..
<Obsidian> It has to do with a mushroom that can take over your mind
<Kid_Cobalt> Sumica: You there?
<Woodenfan> hoo boy
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: WHEN DID YOU BECOME MillionareDash?! :D

<FlareChaser> League Of Legends....Veigar is awesome.
<Woodenfan> Fluttershyfan, where'd he say that? I'm looking for it
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Ahh, they just mentioned "I Am Alive" which is what I thought it might be, so no worries.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Ummm....a while ago....:D
<alexxm> when did doug say that Fluttershy158
<Fluttershyfan158> HE SAID IT IN AN ASK THAT GUY EPISODE
<drf|laptop> 03not my fault I can't talk to girls easily
*drf|laptop hides
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GilDash: Not really. Just sucks to know the bullshit that the game will come with.
<sergio_scriptor> yep
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Ahhh, yeah. Very similar games in concept.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And still watching my hobby rot.
<Woodenfan> thank you!
*Ninjazz steals TheRainbowDash's money
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Well, I try not to support these things on principle. :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01At least on the mainstream end.
<drf|laptop> 03hm junh1024-XD did you pirate CS6 for Windows?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Got mah Bronystate laptop on mah lap and some Metroid Prime in the Wii... I think tonight's gonna be a good night
<Fluttershyfan158> a question showed up involving twilight or RD..
<Dken2021> Fluttershyfan158 take note, ask that guy isn't suppose to be serious
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I won't buy it.
<Ninjazz> Not anymore >:3
<sammiver> how do i make pony faces ?
<TheRainbowDash> I should get Diablo III, but I am not interested in that type of game at all....hmm.
<Golakka> Is it just me, or does this boss look like Nocturne?
<Sumica> 00,10What's up Kid_Cobalt?
<Biglaw> Now, if Bill Gates were a brony, we'd control the world!
<Skylands> 10You talk to me just fine
<Fluttershyfan158> and i think he said it during a convention
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts GilDash
<sergio_scriptor> in the asked that guy episode thought about who was the bst pony: anwser twilight is the best pony :)
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I really don't keep up with gaming anymore. When I start saving up for my new PC however... :D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> No TheRainbowDash why waste money on something you're not interested in?
<Svettponny> Hello guise, I just joined, and what the HELL? Is that TotalBiscuit?
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: No! Why you steral my 5 million money?

<drf|laptop> 03I was gonna say something mean
<drf|laptop> 03but I won't xD

<drf|laptop> 03I like it down here :<
<TheRainbowDash> OmegaMetroidBrony: Yeah, it was sid of "Perfect game and that anypony will like it", but I shouldn't buy it still.
<junh1024-XD> i downloaded CS6MC, but didn't install yet
<Fluttershyfan158> its not suposed to be taken seriously but he sure knew an awful lot about twilight and RD
<TheRainbowDash> (said)
<drf|laptop> 03also LOL, that totally sounds like BDSM, just saying
*drf|laptop runs
<drf|laptop> 03well the reason I ask jun, is because

<drf|laptop> 035. CLEAN & REPLACE or Copy SSC from package
<drf|laptop> 03in both x86 and x64 common\adobe = c:\program files***\common\adobe\ssc
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Yeah well, I don't blame you. If you got a bad PC, you're pretty much screwed over. If you do have a pretty good PC, you're still screwed over. And then consoles... Still pretty much the same. :D
<drf|laptop> 03There is no ssc folder in x64
<drf|laptop> 03only x86
<drf|laptop> 03so I'm not sure what they want me to do
<TheXIIILightning> I liked FF13 ^^
<junh1024-XD> duno, i'm on 32bit
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: You don't deserve that much money. >:3
<Litwick> :D
<sergio_scriptor> Fluttershyfan159: actualy if you notest in some of his nostalgia critic videos,he sometimes makes subtle references to the show :)
<RankWinner> Why would you be screwed with a good PC?
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Good PC you're only screwed by money, but that hopefully won't be a concern to me. :D
<Fluttershyfan158> that too!!
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: I got it from person in box. Give me 5 million money, or make me video.
<Biglaw> That awkward moment when Final Fantasy hits 30 games.
<Fluttershyfan158> HE HAS JOINED US...
<drf|laptop> 03eh, nvm
<RosePetal> Are they talking about hot shots girls?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Ninjazz please if you're in the business I'm in you have more monies than TRD

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Damn you chat
<Wrek> 05hah
<TheRainbowDash> Biglaw: "Final Fantasy XXX:......Whgen will this fucking end??!?"
<Ninjazz> GilDash: What about those blood thirsty vampires that go by the name of Game Publishers.
<TheRainbowDash> (when)
<junh1024-XD> and i didn't clean anything
<panda> OK I just walked back in... um... WTF?
<Ersatz> What difficulty is this, Wrek?

<GilDash> Ninjazz: Hey, I can avoid the bad games still. :D
<Biglaw> TheRainbowDash :| Final Fantasy XXX
<Fleta> Just press play again
<sergio_scriptor> Flettershyfan159:the masters of the internet are joining us, soon the entire internet and wold will folow MUAHAHAHA
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: First you gotta threaten my family. >:3
<drf|laptop> 03CS5.5 had a different method for warez
<Ersatz> Ah. You're pretty tanky then.
<junh1024-XD> onry A5
<drf|laptop> 03because you had to replace DLLs
<Wrek> 05mhm
<drf|laptop> 03not that file
<TheRainbowDash> Biglaw: For 30, you kno-oh, snap...:D
<Dken2021> Biglaw lol
<Ninjazz> OmegaMetroidBrony: Care to make some investments?
<Wrek> 05got around 12k health
<junh1024-XD> i replaced a dll in my A5
<GilDash> Ninjazz: 'Sides, there's more indie developers on the PC I can support. :)
<Wrek> 05focus in life steal
<Fluttershyfan158> All thats missing is for AVGN to say he's one
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Lol nope My business is illegal
<Wrek> 05and armor
<Wrek> 05vitality
<Ersatz> That's pretty impressive for nightmare.
<TheRainbowDash> (threatens Ninjazz's family) Make me video, or give me my money.
<cowvarkian> what business is that OmegaMetroidBrony
<junh1024-XD> seems like there are two ways:
<Ninjazz> GilDash: True... But what Indie game needs a good computer? :S
<drf|laptop> 034. DISABLE any adobe services - make sure you do this, it's an important part of my solution
<drf|laptop> 03AAM \ ADM services = adobe app\download manager
<drf|laptop> 03Mostly this little guy who pops after offline registration: C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\OOBE\PDApp\P6\AAM Registration Notifier.exe. You can rename its extension to ***.BAK.
<drf|laptop> 03And: search your processes for anything with adobe in path. (task manager...)
<drf|laptop> 035. CLEAN & REPLACE or Copy SSC from package
<drf|laptop> 03in both x86 and x64 common\adobe = c:\program files***\common\adobe\ssc
<junh1024-XD> serial or crack
<drf|laptop> 036. REPLACE "reset files" from package
<drf|laptop> 03to P6 folder (search or look prev posts)
<Biglaw> YES!
<Ersatz> Magicka
<OmegaMetroidBrony> The kind of business that gets you're runners killed
<drf|laptop> 03"C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\OOBE\PDApp\P6"
<drf|laptop> 037. RUN En and ACTIVATE
<drf|laptop> 03Run Encore (optional about 8 times) each time using a different serial (prev posts). Activate offline/"trouble with internet" by copying and pasting request code to response code.
<Biglaw> AC3
<Ghosties> 04Oh hello Assassin's Creed III
<drf|laptop> 03Updated note: It should repeatetly ask you for new serials as if you didn't activate.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Some of them are actually really good.
<RosePetal> Snooooow!
<drf|laptop> 038. REPLACE "normal activation" from package
<drf|laptop> 03to P6 folder. Upon running encore no further code or activation should appear and the app should start.
<Fluttershyfan158> assasin creed
<sergio_scriptor> Fluttershyfan158:he already said,what he thought about mlp : "i dont care for itt" his words
<TheRainbowDash> Hmmm? What is this?
<drf|laptop> 03that's what it says
<drf|laptop> 03I used a serial...
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: D: FINE! Take 1 million monies.
<Ghosties> 04Later this year...later this year
<GilDash> I've only played the first AC. :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ubisoft game. I won't even start.
<Fleta> And the other part wants to RUN AWAYYYYYYYYYY
<panda> Ghosties: dat Ghosties :D
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lincon is a templar :p
<RosePetal> Redcoats!
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Ghosties
<Ghosties> 04This game cannot come out fast enough
<Biglaw> TheRainbowDash only the most nerdgasmic trailer ever
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: You still took 4 million of my money, and I want back.
<Svettponny> I'm actually tempted to get AC:III, I played AC and AC: II, but never bothered with all the damn sequals to the second one.
<cachi01> AAAAHHHHHH WAITING IS MAGIC IS HARD
<Fluttershyfan158> oh...well...nevermind..
<Wrek> 05im not nerdgasming...
<panda> Nittany_Discord: yes, save us the disapointment :( we already know the shit stain that is ubisoft :|
<RosePetal> Bear!
<TheXIIILightning> Running WHILE asasinating!!
<TheRainbowDash> Biglaw: I've seen more nerdgasmic trailers than this.
<Wrek> 05DISSAPOINTMENT
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Mmmmmm... No. >:3
<Fluttershyfan158> at least we still have Doug Walker
<Dan> OMG IS THIS BATMAN??
<Skylands> 10DOMINO
<Ghosties> 04I am a huuuuuuuuuge fan of early American history, so for an AC game to take place during the American Revolution rustles my jimmies immensely
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not enough people do.
<cachi01> dead island trailer gave me the hardest nerdgasm i ever had
<GilDash> Ubisoft can die, EA can die, Activision can die...
<Litwick> Asassin's Creed 3.
<sergio_scriptor> CHARGE YOUR DRUMS INTO THE BATTLE- criken reference :)
<Ersatz> ^ Ghosties
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Then you shall die for stealing my money, and so of your family.
<RosePetal> But I like the sims.
<Fluttershyfan158> has anyone ever heard of ponypokey?
<sergio_scriptor> yes
<TheXIIILightning> Epic Running
*Nittany_Discord 11,01gives GilDash a dollar.
<RosePetal> Yes!
<dshannon> going into smaller building?! what is this madness!
<junh1024-XD> HOW DO I LIVE without you, I want to know
<GilDash> <--- They've used a common sound effect at least 3 times in that trailer. :|
<Svettponny> Dat logo
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Ehhh. I'm already depressed like hell. Can't much better than this right now. :)
<panda> Nittany_Discord: well... still dont say it :( I'm still trying to get over it
<junh1024-XD> how do i BREATHE without you, if you ever go
<Fluttershyfan158> they kick ass
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: That'll be no help at all. I'm in England. :D
*flutter_shy is playing fusionfall
*Biglaw assassin-gasms
<RosePetal> This trailer looks promising though.
<junh1024-XD> how do i EVER, happen so fast
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh Metroid Prime how I love playing ping pong with your doors <3
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Thanks anyway. :)
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Wait, really?
<junh1024-XD> how do I, how do I, how do i LIVE
<Dken2021> and since it's setting is pre-america, it might attract the cod fans
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Blow your nose with it.
<junh1024-XD> </random>
<Skylands> 10Poetry by juhn1024-XD
<alexxm> honestly i like the look of this game
<HyperMetalLugia> back
<nickstr> not really
<Riders> I am still not sold on this game.
<junh1024-XD> nah, some randome song by Le-anne Rhymes
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> hey hey panda
<HyperMetalLugia> anyways
<cachi01> dead island trailer = super duper mega hyper nerdgasm
<panda> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: :D hiya
<nickstr> its called How Do I Live
<Ersatz> Colonial America needs more games.
<HyperMetalLugia> I made a hugeeee mistake when reinstalling Mint 13 ;-;
<Ghosties> 04I think you'd be better off getting Torchwood and Torchwood 2
<nickstr> and it was done by Trisha Yearwood too
<cachi01> in my oppinion AC is a great series
<Fluttershyfan158> i went on a trip to canada once and went to alberta..there was a fair..and then i saw an MLP FIM live...
<nickstr> in late 1997
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Yeah... I don't want to put the tag on though cause I (even though I appreciate the concer) don't want to type to everypony I meet asking me whats wrong. :D
<Dan> "cussed out"?
<Fluttershyfan158> oh god why
<GabeMoist> This guy's jimmies are rustled by the time period as well
<Ersatz> Your opinion is objectively wrong, cachi.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Awesome game...ruined by Ubisoft.
<Cobellanez> You mean Torchlight Ghosties ?
<Ghosties> 04Yes, that thing
<StupidSexyCJ> wait, a torchwood game? ans in Dr. Who spin-off torchwood?
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Oh, right...I'll get started then...(kills you) There you go.:D
<Fluttershyfan158> it was awful.
<Biglaw> Nittany_Discord hardly
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ncr ?
<Ersatz> AC has good games. It's a bad series, because they're all just rehashes though.
<TheXIIILightning> The bear is a Browncoat!!
<cachi01> AC is awesome but revelations was just bad
<cowvarkian> thats totally not a biased opinion Nittany_Discord
<Ghosties> 04No no, damn Dari and his streaming
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that bear is NCR ! kill him
<cachi01> revelatins was too rushed
<Biglaw> XD The bear is a browncoat!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01AC2 PC was ruined by the worst DRM in existence.
<panda> cowvarkian: not bias if its true :|
<Ghosties> 04Torchlight, yes
<RankWinner> Path of Exile beats D3 in every aspect as far as I am concerned
<prince-dari> Ghosties, wut
<GilDash> Us Brits still are twats. I'll be the first to admit it. :D
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Thanks you... t^t
<GabeMoist> Blame dari!
<sammiver> ive now been reading my little dashie for 15 minutes and it is very interesting

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Damnit dari you and you're postion on this earth making it day time there and night time here
<prince-dari> I'm not streaming?
<Fluttershyfan158> Twilight, Applejack, and Rainbow Dash were the only ponies in it..no Pinkie, Fluttershy, or Rarity...

<Meanwhile> ^
<Biglaw> Ezio is best pony
<Fluttershyfan158> and to make it worse..they were singing pinkie pies songs without pinkie being there

<SunderlandPony89> Ok, now those kids NEED to die
<Kandarihu> Woodenfan: we'd be internet savvy farmers or something. The average age of today's farmers is 62, so it falls to us to replace them.
<Woodenfan> oh god sergio. That'd be freaky
<DeadlyPony3> Did that Panda run on the other's ass :P
<RosePetal> So many SINS!
<derpy_pony> Studying must be hard when the old guy talks all the time

<Soupcan> where theres smoke theres fire
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why did this guy move?
<RosePetal> It's not his dad?
<DuskStarshimmer> Smoke is a myth, its called STEAM
*PartyCannon cuts footloose
<derpy_pony> or smoke grenades
<Big_Jake-intosh> woohoo caught that stupid gnat that was flying aroung my face :)
<DeadlyPony3> Oh wait, it added depth :P
<Biglaw> Where there's smoke, there's a bakery
<Sumica> 00,10is't it his car?
<StinkomanFan> and that's how Ren met Stimpy
<Yahooz> I have an announcement...

<KaitoThePony> where theres smoke theres dead people
<StinkomanFan> You're pregnant?

<RosePetal> Vent out my frustration!
<Yahooz> This chat is now full off...
<otakon> StinkomanFan: :/
<Yahooz> YES
<RAWRity> and now for the most gloriously ridiculous scene in film history.
<DeadlyPony3> Where theres smoke, theres a dragon
<Sumica> 00,10need some emo music
<Big_Jake-intosh> otakon: it had it coming
<Obsidian> Another great scene
<derpy_pony> smoke means 5fps for everyone
<icybeauti> wooooo

<otakon> Big_Jake-intosh: yeah, it REALLY deserved that

<Obsidian> Dance out your frustrations
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Gotta smoke and drink to relieve my anger
<red_ony> goes together
<Meanwhile> SunderlandPony89: Incredibly smug captain Sulu.

<TheRainbowDash> Oh my celestia, this choice of music is amazing.:)
*DeathStar dances in anticipation
<Biglaw> Watch out guys...
<KaitoThePony> This guy is me im blond and i love to DANCE AND OTHER STUFF
<Crippler> where there's smoke, there's rich, hickory flavor
<K_A> Kandarihu: My prediction is that engineers will become the new farmers thanks to modern biotech and big agro-industry.

<Yahooz> too much smug
<derpy_pony> so intense
<Bloxx> Dude, he's sinning SO HARD right now
<Obsidian> angry dancing
<Big_Jake-intosh> I have never seen this movie before
<otakon> MY GOD!! The cheese levels are reaching CRITICAL LEVELS!
<Sumica> 00,10So he's dancen with his car?

<Airpuff> Dat dance..
<OmegaMetroidBrony> *dance
*DuskStarshimmer chants "strip!"
<otakon> I don't know if I can take much more
<DeadlyPony3> ...Did the sun explode outside?!
<Bloxx> my reaction to dubstep
<StinkomanFan> LordCelestia, thanks for the pizza!
<otakon> the cheese SO MUCH CHEESE
<RivaLz> xD
<Midnight_Fyre> You people just don't get the deep symbolism of this scene :P
<Soupcan> rope
<FlareChaser> Bloxx: wat
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was aliens.
<derpy_pony> a typical evening in the 80s
<Kandarihu> Well, we gotta get our food somewhere. And everyone who's been growing it are getting too old for it.
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: I'm just about to switch to Mafia II. I'm not even paying attention
<Rain> "utoh he's taking the car" = "gais, he's going out to dance again"
<FlareChaser> Aliens.
<red_ony> ill go get myself a drink dancing like that..its great to lhave your own flat^^
<Meanwhile> The symbolism is acting like a cock.
<Woodenfan> he's not dancing with his car anymore and OH MY GOD WHY IS HE SWINGING ON A ROPE
<DuskStarshimmer> how does his car stero carry so far @_@?
<otakon> lol SunderlandPony89
<sergio_scriptor> Woodenfan : well you never know what people may like in a few hundred years,did you think people in 1940 would ever think that an large amout of people would join together to watch a show with ponies ? :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What are we talking about?
<K_A> My reaction to super eurobeat.
<KaitoThePony> 100% kaito
<Dark92Enigma> My reaction after my HOMEWORK FAILURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Ersatz> Worlds loudest car radio to fill that whole factory?
<StinkomanFan> Dat dance
<Dken2021> Midnight_Fyre he want's to dance like no one's watchign?
<Woodenfan> true sergio
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: that game was underwhelming tbh, too short and linear
<Meanwhile> The meaning is being the lead singer of Erasure.
<K_A> Alternatively: Me on energy drinks
<RAWRity> Dken2021: here's the jist: Kevin Bacon just moved to a town where dancing is banned, and is being treated like shit. He's now dancing out his aggression.
<DeadlyPony3> Wow, I usually just play video games to vent away frustration :P
<Yahooz> Meanwhile: you win
<KaitoThePony> this guy looks like me

<StinkomanFan> AND LIVE IN HARMONY
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> There's a gym conveniently placed in that empty factory.
<Big_Jake-intosh> that was so silly
<Kandarihu> Um, this guy's rage-dancing. He's dancing to burn off his pent-up frustration. Is that how you feel about dubstep and eurobeat?
<Meanwhile> Harmony
<RX-78-SweetieBot> :IVE IN HARMONY HARMONY OHHHHHHHHH LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE
<K_A> That scene was very important to the plot development.
<Sumica> 00,10quick sit casualy on the car act like noting happend
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> this needs more railings and sweatpants.
<Woodenfan> why is she there? how'd she know he would be there
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: It was mean't to be linear despite the open-world. And I'm still enjoying it. Getting all of the DLC FOR FREE was great too :D

<Rain> "comin on a little strong there, lady"
<Woodenfan> here comes sex?
<Fenr> burn
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: it was still an enjoyable experience, though the ending was a bit of a let down tbh.
<DuskStarshimmer> Boyfriends wantz spoon, she wants fork
<Whiskra> so. If a guy doesnt watch her or talk to her, he doesnt like her? What kind of logic is that? slutlogic.
<Ersatz> He called her a slut.
<Yahooz> ...oh were not doing this anymore?
<twilight_sprinkler> in other words, youre a whore. get out.
<StinkomanFan> Rainbow Dash Attack
<Bloxx> My point being, you're a WHORE
<K_A> Kandarihu: But his character probably liked the music, and I'm a very easily frustrated and stressed person anyway.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> WHORE!
