<RAWRity> inb4 Metroid moive....and it's Other M's storyline.
<Iron_Edge> SaxyPretender: *rim shot*
<SaxyPretender> 0,14:3
<Reikim> RAWRity: Another case where I would have to kill a lot of people!
<SunderlandPony89> Reikim: I can see the rage toward that starting and not stopping for a loooooooooooong time
<WindWhistler> err...I mean, the main character is dead in the end.
<Diglett> punch out
<ZackBot> 5:l
<killerpony7733> guys guuuys the reactor core is god damn offline what to do? :O
<WindWhistler> And some side character gets all the glory
<WindWhistler> and gets the girl
<Reikim> Why does Shizu enjoy punching things so much?
<WindWhistler> Reikim: Because they make funny noies.
<WindWhistler> noises*
<SunderlandPony89> Zombies are pathetic in this game. I mean seriously, a flashlight?
<Wrek> 05i like how the devs atleast tried to get some feelign of choice into the game when you got to choose if you want to send the transmission or not during comm 2. too bad it doesnt matter in the end. but it was nice of them to try atleast.
<WindWhistler> Wrek: wouldn't that make the players feel even more insulted than if they didn't have choices?
<Diglett> wheres the scary?
<Shizuka> 13yeah this is safe, even with railings...
<SunderlandPony89> ME3 incomming
<DeadpoolDash> Doom will never have choice besides: Kill Demons or Die?
<RainbowJack> Shizuka is cheating
<Spriggals> ORANGE
<Reikim> I SHOULD be dealing with me backlog of betareading...nah, screw it.
<Wrek> 05it was quite sublte. if you sent it you get the dialoge liek that
<Wrek> 05but betruger ends up sending it if you didnt
<Polydunami> I like it when it's scary
<Wrek> 05if you send it
<Wrek> 05then betruger will jstu say
<kirzstryfe> 8,6CoD has more railings
<Wrek> 05"thanks"
<Diglett> Polydunami What scary?
<RainbowJack> its online
<Wrek> 05Shizuka: i bet procedure orange was "hit button"
<Shizuka> 13so complicated ><
<WindWhistler> Nah, it was probably "keep doing what you're doing"
*RainbowJack hugs Wrek
<sagas> killerpony7733: So any advice?
<DeadpoolDash> I though Orange was mix Red with Yellow?
<DeadpoolDash> thought
<Wrek> 05hi RainbowJack ^_^
<WindWhistler> "After all, you're a whole lot more competent than any of us"
<Polydunami> I said, " I like it when it's scary," NOT "I think it's scary," Diglett.
<sagas> Why you starting, DeadpoolDash?
<RainbowJack> hi wrek nice to see your not typing drunk :P
<dishwasher_EXTREME> #Dashiesauce
<Wrek> 05but oyu get my point WindWhistler: it was back when no game had done that before
<killerpony7733> sagas i....really..can't say in some way you may need to think alot over it
<WindWhistler> oh boy, an ignorant advertiser!
<Wrek> 05it was early and experimental
<Reikim> What the Doom series taught us: whenever we go to space, we have to make sure to have more anti-demon-invasion procedures.
<Wrek> 05and nice and new at the time
<MahBoi777> hi RainbowJack, how are you?
<Spriggals> This game needs a crowbar
<WindWhistler> Yeah, I get it.
<DeadpoolDash> start what? My engines?
<sagas> killerpony7733: I know and I have and it never gets any simpler :'( :'(
<SunderlandPony89> Spriggals: But it has a chainsaw
<RainbowJack> Mahboi777 : i am doing fine just woke up and need to get ready for work
<WindWhistler> Though personally, I'd be afraid of making the "wrong" choice.
<Polydunami> All that plasma :3
<DeadpoolDash> where are the chest high walls?
<sagas> RainbowJack: Where do you work?
<Reikim> What FPSs in general have taught us: if you're not that one guy with all the guns, you have a 1/1000 chance of surviving. And will do so only if the guy with all the guns happens to miss you during the ship-is-exploding timed sequence.
<MahBoi777> RainbowJack: oh, well good mornin
<Wrek> 05oH! iirc Shizuka you get the bfg next level if you get the code
<SunderlandPony89> DeadpoolDash: In the pit with the regenerative realth
<killerpony7733> sagas i can't really help you but you seem to have the issue of wanting intimacy with guys but sex with girls
<RainbowJack> sagas : at a big company here in the netherlands
<Alister> Reikim: Except Iin Deus Ex ( to be fair it's more RPG) I let everyone live
<sagas> killerpony7733: I know
<Wrek> 05apparently the PDA is a pain to find but meh
<Spriggals> Zambies
<Alister> time for some Fisting
<DeadpoolDash> so does this autoaim like the first doom?
<Polydunami> Ugh
<killerpony7733> sagas maybe you just don't see sex logical with guys
<Wrek> 05DeadpoolDash: no
<Reikim> And Shizuka gets in another boxing match with the zombies.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Tonight on BronyState, Shizuka beats the shit out of zombies
<sagas> RainbowJack: ooo The Neatherlands. I visited there once. It was very nive
<RainbowJack> Shizuka is cheating
<SunderlandPony89> 4-KILL STREAK
<WindWhistler> I remember I missed a standing target with a sniper in Borderlands...my cousin never let me live it down.
<Alister> I just realised what Fisting means. I'm sorry
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: Sounds like a good night.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14eeeyup
<Diglett> Shizuka this is doom not punchout
<Wrek> 05alister: no worries
*hen3ry facehoofs
<killerpony7733> Alister hahaha
<Reikim> Alister.../).=
<WindWhistler> It was because it kept moving, so I was afraid I was going to miss.
<RainbowJack> sagas : yes the netherlands is nice
<Iron_Edge> Alister: :D
<DeadpoolDash> this...is...DOOM!!!
<sagas> killerpony7733: I dont know I just dont feel it. Thinking of sex with guys just doesnt arouse me
<RainbowJack> Wrek : how are you feeling?
<sagas> killerpony7733: For whatever reason
<WindWhistler> Usually when you're aiming, the gun stays still, but these games that like to go more realistic try to make it unsteady, and that screws me up
<Wrek> 05heartburn, headache and tired at 5:23 in the morning
<Wrek> 05gona go to bed soon ^_^
<Alister> sagas: asexuality , it exists
<hen3ry> indeed it does
<Reikim> Wrek: ...Go to sleep, man.
<Polydunami> Alister, pansexuality exists too.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Wrek
<killerpony7733> Alister he said he wants intimacy with guys but sex with girls
<sagas> Alister: But sex with women still does
*DeadpoolDash likes sex, with the ladies
<WindWhistler> Wait, you guys are STILL talking about that stuff?
<Spartan-Pie> punchout time
<killerpony7733> Alister that isn't asexuality
<Reikim> Polydunami: So does omnisexuality, but we haven't quite gotten to that point yet.
<WindWhistler> Oh silly me, it's about sex, of course they're gonna be talking about it for a while
<Iron_Edge> Wrek: Heart burn, nausia, indegestion...Upset stomach, Dyahrea...
<Polydunami> Oh my, that's... interesting...
<Wrek> 05favorite doom enemy for me aughta be the revenant though
<Greth206> Pepto Bismol
<Wrek> 05its the one most rememorable for me
<Diglett> .
<Alister> sagas: Sorry didn't see that. You're probably just shy for now. It'll be ok once you find the right girl
<DeadpoolDash> time for the sex song...
<RainbowJack> i played doom 3 i only used godmod in the hell part
<Wrek> 05DeadpoolDash more spam form you adn you get a timeout ban
<CECtheRonin> Wrek Every time someone says Revenant, I think of Mass Effect 3. :p
<DeadpoolDash> okay wrek
<Shizuka> 13usually i god the whole way through
<Shizuka> 13this mod added regen health
<Wrek> 05CECtheRonin: proof of your age
<Shizuka> 13which i cranked up obviously
<Alister> Well , Finals tommorow. So Good Night Everypony !
<Shizuka> 13moment, need drink
<CECtheRonin> Wrek Do tell. :|
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later Alister
<CECtheRonin> Night, Alister!
<Polydunami> Goodnight Alister :3
<kirzstryfe> 8,6and then Shizuka gets ambushed while she's afk
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Alister: Dream of Ponies
*DeadpoolDash thinks Wrek doesn't liek me
<WindWhistler> You kids these days and your mods
<SunderlandPony89> Cya Alister and good luck on the finals!
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> kirzstryfe: awww
<MahBoi777> gnight Alister, good luck
<Gamefreak300> Stuck in my head... T_T Watch at your own risk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WxcaCjiMw
<RainbowJack> CECtheRonin : REAPERS!!!!
<Wrek> 05Gamefreak300: no youtube links during streams
<WindWhistler> Back in my day, we had to do things without hacking, because there was no way to hack
<Iron_Edge> DeadpoolDash: -lol- you silly foal. Just give him a hug.
<Spriggals> *Insert Shaun Of The Dead theme*
<CECtheRonin> RainbowJack CRAP *ducks for cover*
<Gamefreak300> Oh whoops... my bad. Wasn't aware
<Shizuka> 13can probably make it to hell tonight
<SunderlandPony89> CECtheRonin: The Revenant in ME3 was a pretty good gun
<Polydunami> My most memorable Doom enemy is actually a tie between the cacodemon and the hell knight.
<Wrek> 05Gamefreak300: better read the rules then
<WindWhistler> I can understand hacking a computer, but I have no idea how people hack consoles...
<CECtheRonin> Though the Reapers do sound better than Nirvana. :D
<Wrek> 05Shizuka: you gotta beat the guardian while im here!
<Gamefreak300> Wrek, I'll take a look. Been awhile!
<Shizuka> 13dat cheap jump scare :#
<RainbowJack> CECtheRonin : i hated the ending of ME3 ME2 is best game
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> lol
<CECtheRonin> SunderlandPony89 Haven't used it in a while.
<Polydunami> Dang imps :|
<Diglett> gamefreak300 : if its stuck in your head posting it wont get it out
<Shizuka> 13i wonder how many testers fell for that
<WindWhistler> I miss playing Phantasy Star Online....
<Wrek> 05all of them
<SunderlandPony89> CECtheRonin: You spell Nickelback weirdly :D
<WindWhistler> if only we didn't misplace the disk...
<Polydunami> Wait, Shizuka, that was supposed to be scary?
<Spartan-Pie> WindWhistler : many of them just use modio and a flash drive on a jail j-taged 360
<Gamefreak300> Diglett, it was a fun video! I just wanted to share the wealth. Stuck in my head all the same though.
<WindWhistler> Spartan-Pie: ..............................come again?
<Diglett> polydunami: maybe there scary isnt our scary
<WindWhistler> See? To hack, you need extra knowledge. Knowledge that, as far as I'm concerned, isn't worth learning just to do something on a game.
<Polydunami> I suppose.
<Reikim> Great, I reconnect and the stream is dead.
<Polydunami> Polydunami doesn't really scare easily :S
<Reikim> WindWhistler: Hmmm, depends on what you're doing.
<WindWhistler> I mean, you have to learn the programming and all these codes and stuff
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Polydunami
<Spartan-Pie> they usally have to mod the console first
<Spriggals> BATTH ROOM
<kirzstryfe> 8,6stream's fine, probably something on your end Reikim
*Polydunami sneezes
<WindWhistler> it's really complicated, and I couldn't take the time to learn about that stuff.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> zombie taking a shit
<Iron_Edge> WindWhistler: Or look it up on youtube and follow the video insturctions :D -lol-
<Reikim> Thanks, going to go fix that now...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...oh that's a bad way to go
<Diglett> Diglet does get scared
<WindWhistler> lol...zombie using the bathroom?
<Diglett> At all
<Polydunami> Shoot ALL the lights :3
<Spartan-Pie> like for ps3 you have to get it jail broken
<Shizuka> 13so fun fact
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> kill all the light
<Iron_Edge> WindWhistler: You dont have to be einstien to hack a video game :D
<Diglett> bullet poof lighting
<Shizuka> 13in the doom 3 engine, there is no natural light
<Shamroc> oh a fun fact
<Wrek> 05this came out 05... i was.. 12 at the time, yes i was fuckign scared when i played it :P
<Shizuka> 13there must actually be a light source in order for something to show
<WindWhistler> Iron_Edge: Really? O_o
<Shizuka> 13that's why it's so dark
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> lol, no global illumination
<Polydunami> So you could possibly play in pitch black...
<Shizuka> 13it's fascinating reading the code
<Iron_Edge> WindWhistler: eyup *rustles your mane*
<sagas> Ha Wrek is scared of Doom 3
<Shizuka> 13ZOMBIELAND RULE 4
<Shizuka> 13ALWAYS FEAR THE BATHROOM
<Randomnerd> Hm
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: What about when you were on the train heading to delta? Wasnt there sunlight through the windows?
<WindWhistler> Iron_Edge: le gasp!
<Reikim> Wrek, you were allowed to play this at 12? Lucky you.
*WindWhistler faints from shock
<BronyCody1> That sucks someone has taken my name lol.
<sagas> Scared, Shizuka?
<Shizuka> 13TWO IMPS ENTER
<Spriggals> wtf
<Shizuka> 13ONE IMP LEAVES... THEN DIES
<WindWhistler> IN DA BATHROOM
<Wrek> 05Reikim: i played the first doom at the age of 3 so
<RainbowJack> Dead Space is Scary
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yay zombie infighting
<Shizuka> 13Iron_Edge: one huge light
<Polydunami> My first experience with Doom was actually Doom 64 for the Nintendo 64, oddly enough.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, brb, gotta restart this
<Dark92Enigma> OK....gotta go everypony
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: Damn
<Shizuka> 13also no i don't think there's any jump scares left for me in this game
<Shizuka> 13played too many times
<WindWhistler> I couldn't possibly play games like this. I scare easily.
<Reikim> Wrek: Wow, that's...impressive. My parents were way too strict, so I wasn't able to play M games until I found the means to buy them myself.
<Wrek> 05Shizuka: more or less same but there is always one i forget here and there x3
<WindWhistler> I'd probably be jumping at every corner.
<WindWhistler> Not to mention the paranoia knowing the enemy could jump out from anywhere
<Diglett> PUNCHOUT! time
<Polydunami> Wrek, I played Wolfenstein 3D when I was about five.
<HyperMetalLugia> rawr
<SunderlandPony89> RainbowJack: You should try Silent Hill 2 if you want to a scary game
<ponibas> body blow!
<SunderlandPony89> KNOCKOUT!
<Reikim> Shizuka will PUNCH you into shape! Unless you die!
<Shizuka> 13okay i know there's a way in here, help?
*SunderlandPony89 rings a bell
<WindWhistler> geez, doesn't that guy ever get tired of laughing?
*drfsupercenter sighs
<Wrek> 05heck, my mom and dad used to play the first dooms adn marathosn together with me sitting in his lap watching
<Spartan-Pie> my parents got me halo CE the month it came out when i was 9
<Wrek> 05good times

*WindWhistler holds a lightbulb over Shizuka's head
<WindWhistler> any ideas yet?
<CriticKitten> And off to bed.
<Reikim> Wrek, cherish your parents forever.

<WindWhistler> ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PRESS ONE OR TWO BUTTONS
<Spriggals> Sounds like a english german accent
<RAWRity> you know what we should all do? Bronystate Paintball Tournament
<Spartan-Pie> i got gta 2 on the deamcast when i was a kid it was awesome
<WindWhistler> Greth206: No, she doesn't. Only when I force her to. Which isn't very ofte.
<WindWhistler> often*
<Shizuka> 13this guy narrates the videos too
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> yup
<Greth206> Ah well...
<Reikim> RAWRity: Yeah, if you can scrape together the money for the plane ticket.
<WindWhistler> My mom gave me permission to play Halo. It didn't end very well....
<Sylandest> evening, everypony! :) How are we all tonight?

<superretroworld> WindWhistler: true
<drfsupercenter> 03public String toString() -- gives the inorder traversal. <- I dunno how to do any of this...
<WindWhistler> And the fear of an enemy popping out at you from anywhere...
<WindWhistler> and then The Maw
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Shizuka> 13which is actually 931
<Shizuka> 13got that yesterday~
<WindWhistler> Though I heard a funny thing.
<HyperMetalLugia> I just set up SSH for my parent's PC (access from anywhere) and I would like to use it as a tunne/proxy for my laptop when I am at school
<MahBoi777> Sylandest: I am doing great, thanks for asking, how about u?:)
<Polydunami> I like the part with the flood
<HyperMetalLugia> :s
<WindWhistler> Apparently there's a secret scene you can get during that ending
<WindWhistler> And it's hilarious
<junh1024-XD> isn't tostring an inherted method of every object?
<Spartan-Pie> i was scared of the flood when i first played halo for the first time
<Shizuka> 13i don't think this is steve blum
<Polydunami> WindWhistler, you have to beat The Maw on the highest difficulty
<Sylandest> MahBoi777: pretty good as well, hehe. Just relaxing as the evening winds down. Have I missed much?
<Shizuka> 13but could be wrong
<Wrek> 05STEAL HIS PISTOL Shizuka!
<junh1024-XD> anyway, implemet/override this method in your class to return w/e he wants
<Shizuka> 13blum does a lot of voices for this
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> do it
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but
<drfsupercenter> 03I dunno how to do an inorder traversal
<drfsupercenter> 03let alone make it a string
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<SunderlandPony89> The Flood ruined Halo 1-3 for me. Just coulldn't stand those annoying bastards
<drfsupercenter> 03and this is due in 20 mins...
<Ascendant> C or C++?
<junh1024-XD> Java
<WindWhistler> SunderlandPony89: They scared the crap out of me...
<SunderlandPony89> No, that doesn't sound like Blum
<Ascendant> oh
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> stolen ha
<superretroworld> SunderlandPony89: why?
<WindWhistler> But for some reason, I always loved the ones that fall over and explode
<drfsupercenter> 03http://faculty.washington.edu/moishe/javademos/jss2/ArrayBinaryTree.java
<drfsupercenter> 03I can like

<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Ascendant> well uh, syntax in C is like Token(1, true).ToString(); sorta thing
<SunderlandPony89> WindWhistler: You need to try Silent Hill 2. True pshyological horror, and it was brilliant
<TheRareP0N3> SUUPPPERRR MEAT BOY. ;B
<Wrek> 05red neurotoxin
<WindWhistler> I always called them "Wobblies" because of their wobbly arms
<Spriggals> "Have a nice day"
<Ascendant> dunno what it's like in java
<RainbowJack> atleast the robot voice is nice
<WindWhistler> You know the one I'm talking about?
<Ascendant> And er HML
<Shizuka> 13bit of a spooky machine...
<Shizuka> 13course they all are
<junh1024-XD> you can reference the code?
<WindWhistler> RainbowJack: That's what they thought about GLaDOS.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> all that decontaminating
<Ascendant> are you able to access the SSH from school?
<Polydunami> SunderlandPony89, I've never played a Silent Hill game and I'd like to try them out.
<TheRareP0N3> DECONTAMINATION

<TheRareP0N3> THAVE A NICE DAY
*LadyCanary peeks into chat.

<Polydunami> Trouble is, I don't have a playstation
<LadyCanary> :D WREKY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Randomnerd> Hi, LadyCanary!
<SunderlandPony89> superretroworld: The Flood missions were just long, boring, tedious, and drawn out segments that sadly made up more than half of Halo 1-3, and I ended up selling all 3 because of those freakin' flood levels
<WindWhistler> Anyone?
<Spartan-Pie> i remember those flood
<LadyCanary> What is streaming? :o
<MahBoi777> hi LadyCanary! how are you?
<Polydunami> Oh hey LadyCanary! :3
<Wrek> 05doom 3 a la Shizuka
<sagas> LadyCanary: Doom 3
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, I'm doing it from home
<WindWhistler> For some reason I thought they were cute. Because of those wobbly arms.
<LadyCanary> :D SHIZU PLAYING DOOM 3?!
<HyperMetalLugia> > Using a VPN to connect to my home
<Ascendant> XD
<LadyCanary> All of my WUB AND YES <3
<Ascendant> use the ssh -D flag
<sagas> LadyCanary: She does it all the time
<Reikim> So guys, I'm having a serious dilemma here, and I need help resolving it.
<SunderlandPony89> Polydunami: Silent Hill 2 and 3 are the only real noteworthy ones from what I' ve heard. And I can only speak of SH2's brilliance, since I've yet to start SH3, but SH2 was.. well... there's a reason why it's my favorite game ever
<HyperMetalLugia> I did that
<WindWhistler> But that one level that really scared me was the one with the giant Flood brain thing.
<HyperMetalLugia> SSH -D 9000
<killerpony7733> oh boy halon that gas that sufficates you
<HyperMetalLugia> set my proxy in chrome to localhost 9000
<HyperMetalLugia> but
<RainbowJack> doom 3 a la Cheating Shizuka
<SunderlandPony89> OHai LadyCanary. Seen the newest Metalocapyse yet?
<LadyCanary> sagas: Well I've never seen her play Doom.
<WindWhistler> it scared me so much...
<Ascendant> I haven't used reverse tunelling for ages
<LadyCanary> :O NO I HAVENT SunderlandPony89 D:
<Ascendant> tunnelling
<HyperMetalLugia> on the ssh connection, I can't even *ping* a site from the computer
<Ascendant> and uh
<Wrek> 05Shizuka: did you even play quake 4 by chance?
<WindWhistler> I think it was the second to last level?
<pony14238> On the one hand, sleep is good. And if I stay here any longer, I'm liable to start making pseudophilosophical commentary, and I don't think ANYONE wants that.
<Polydunami> Yeah, that level
<SunderlandPony89> LadyCanary: YOU NEED TO! They made a MLP refrence! Toki is a brony now
<drfsupercenter> 03and my teacher told us not to google stuff, what a moron >_>
<Ascendant> well, from your parents' computer
<Ascendant> or from the reverse tunnel connection?
<pony14238> But on the other, I have Shizuka punching zombies. What do I do?
<LadyCanary> ..And now I love Toki even more.
<sagas> pony14238: I want the commentary...
<Sylandest> SunderlandPony89: you're pulling me tail
<pony14238> Wait
<HyperMetalLugia> from SSH into parent's PC
<XAX> afternoon everyone
<Sylandest> howdy, XAX
<Reikim> Well that's odd
<WindWhistler> Polydunami: So you know what I'm talking about, right?
<MahBoi777> afternoon XAX
<SunderlandPony89> LadyCanary: As if you needed any more reason to love him :D
<geeky-brony> halo evry pony

<HyperMetalLugia> logs in fine, can see files and do stuff
<Shizuka> 13also
<LadyCanary> :D Shizuka!
<HyperMetalLugia> but no networking access :s
<Shizuka> 13canary canary!<33
<Reikim> Anyway, I repeat, NOPONY wants me to start getting philosophical.
<Polydunami> Well, there are those mannequin monsters and the infamous Pyramid Head...
<LadyCanary> ^o^
<Wrek> 05Shizuka: the waste dumps with the enhancement Q4 mods makes that game brilliant
<superretroworld> SunderlandPony89: i only played the 3rd one, only underground finding cortana was boring but the driving scene at the end was awsome
<Spartan-Pie> i remember when you could take out a hunters with just a pistol
<Wrek> 05so grotesque!
<Shizuka> 13oo there's enhancements for q4 too?
<HyperMetalLugia> netstat says I do have localhost-9000 working/listening
<Shizuka> 13i will have to look into that
<Panda> Anypony miss me yet? :D xD
<HyperMetalLugia> so blargh
<Shizuka> 13i want q4 to look this shiny~
<Shizuka> 13i miss panda~
<Sylandest> Panda: I missed you! :) *hugs*
<Reikim> So. Sleep, or zombies?
<WindWhistler> Oh, I'm still talking about Halo. I've never played Silent Hill.

<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> dat mental breakdown
<SunderlandPony89> Sylandest: Thankfully I'm not. They said Toki had a MLP item, although it had a work like "dismembered" after "pony". Still counts though :)
*MahBoi777 hugs Panda back
<WindWhistler> There's one thing I don't understand....
<Om> Sylandest: Fine, and you?
<Sylandest> SunderlandPony89: indeed. I'll have to keep my eye out for this. ty for informing me, hehe :)

<WindWhistler> unless you're still losing blood even after you're dead.
<SunderlandPony89> Panda: We let him outside when he feels like it. Had a hell of a time getting him ini today since for some stupid reason my sister let him out a couple of hours before the time where he WONT came back in, IE nighttime
<Polydunami> I've HEARD of borderlands...
<Reikim> WindWhistler: Sorry, tabletop gaming joke...0 is falling unconscious, negatives is further life loss. -10 is usually death.
<Polydunami> I don't know what it is
<geeky-brony> yay shotgun
<superretroworld> borderlands was so boring
<Shizuka> 13:3
<TheRareP0N3> Polydunami: it's a BA game, look it up

<sagas> Was that a drop-shot?
<Polydunami> Oh, I see
<Panda> SunderlandPony89: :( which is why i usually i made sure my cats are spay and neutered, so they dont have the urge to go outside :D
<WindWhistler> Reikim: Oh. Huh, I always assumed 0 means "ded"
<GenericBrony375> We watchin'....Doom 3?
<Greth206> Borderlands had the most let-down of an ending...
<SunderlandPony89> superretroworld: I'll a gree it got boring after awhile. I eventually sold the game after I got several characters to max level and had sucked all fun out of the game
<owlicious> GenericBrony375: yes
<Diglett> i will say borderlands starts off slow
<Reikim> Not bothering to punch them, Shizuka?
<GenericBrony375> Cool
<geeky-brony> has eny pony play the anlien doom mod
<superretroworld> TheRareP0N3: all that it is is shooting insects in a boring desert

<SunderlandPony89> Polydunami: They became whores to pop culture
<Panda> SunderlandPony89: ah i see....
<superretroworld> SunderlandPony89: yeah it was sorta boring in my opinion, but i heard the ending was dissapointing
<TheRareP0N3> Anyone play Killing floor?
<Reikim> Shoot him.

<LadyCanary> Pew pew pew
<SunderlandPony89> superretroworld: Beyond dissapointing. Granted, what did you expect after a boss that was a giant vagina moster with tentacles?

<TheRareP0N3> superretroworld: No recoiling, inf ammo, and god mod. :B
<Panda> Jaketehsnake: hehe where in cali did you go? you should visit san diego :D
<superretroworld> SunderlandPony89: eeyup, im pretty sure thats where the meme noob came from
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I dunno, SunderlandPony89, the fighting game community can be pretty dickish
*Stallion_of_War finally got a PS3
<Reikim> LadyCanary: All the stuff! Damn I wish we had some good conventions near where I live. Travel is so expensive.
<OtakuTom> I bought MW1, 2, and 3 just for the single-player campaign. I decided to try playing online and it was awful. Nobody would help me out with trying to figure out anything. My teammates in team deathmatch would just berate me for not knowing what I was doing.
<Squallken> hi, what game is this?
<WindWhistler> Don't forget Sonic!
<TheRareP0N3> cod4 is amazing
<SunderlandPony89> WindWhistler: At least they dont call people things I can't even say on here out of fear of teh banhammer
<LadyCanary> Reikim: Aw shucks D:
<Jaketehsnake> Panda, I did go to San Diego! And LA, Anehiem, and Vegas on the way home.
<TheRareP0N3> after cod4 and cod5, everything god stupid
<geeky-brony> cod needs to die
<Squallken> oh doom 3
<WindWhistler> SunderlandPony89: Really? I think they're just chronic complainers.
<WindWhistler> Not to mention they have no creativity.
<TheRareP0N3> geeky-brony: sadly it won't. it's one of activisions most successful franchises
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OtakuTom: Yeah.
<WindWhistler> Apparently recoloring a character makes it your own art.
<Greth206> Hoe does Battlefield stack up?
<LadyCanary> :D Nittany!
<Greth206> *How
<sagas> Why are we discussing COD?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01LadyCanary!
<Panda> Jaketehsnake: well warn me next time, we could meet up or something and watch some pony XD
<Reikim> LadyCanary: On another note, you cosplayed Black Canary! I've only seen her in a couple of things, but I find her interesting. And not just for the fanservice, although that is definitely a factor.
<superretroworld> TheRareP0N3: how do you recoil a gun?
<SunderlandPony89> WindWhistler: ...you have no idea the extend of the things the CoD community say to people they dont like, do you?
<Om> Teleporter?
<TheRareP0N3> superretroworld: no recoiling. :P
<killerpony7733> sagas beats me kinda have a itch against it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CoD jumped the shark after Modern Warfare.
<LadyCanary> She is mai waifu Reikim :3
*Stallion_of_War dusts Nittany_Discord with the Feather duster made from feathers plucked from the many Harpies I've slain recently
<WindWhistler> SunderlandPony89: Probably the same thing any rabid fan says about people they don't like.
<sagas> Well im getting off now
<Om> I volenteer Sylandest for that experiment
<TheRareP0N3> superretroworld: it's pretty easy acutally.
<Jaketehsnake> I got on and Shouted at people saying "HELLO! I AM IN/GOING TO CALIFORNIA!? WHO WANTS TO MEET!?" Sadly, nobody obliged.
<geeky-brony> TheRareP0N3: wich is sad ther beter games out like ninja gaydun
<MahBoi777> Om: which experiment? lol
*Nittany_Discord 11,01feels special and clean.
<RainbowJack> did Wrek fall asleep behind PC?
<Om> MahBoi777: All of them.
<TheRareP0N3> i wasted 60 on that game.
<TheRareP0N3> luckily ii'm buying myself a 50 dollar steam card. :)
<Panda> Jaketehsnake: i think that was during my "stressful" days :( i would have raised a hoof
<geeky-brony> RainbowJack: how r u
<Panda> Shizuka, punchin zombies :D
<MahBoi777> Om: OH, I see
<TheRareP0N3> he's going heavy now. :D
<WindWhistler> RainbowJack: No, he's just lying down
<Spriggals> "Eggheads"
<Greth206> Eggheads
<Greth206> Dangit...
<twilight_sprinkle> eggheads haw? he ded
<Om> My gawd
<TheRareP0N3> I'M AN EGGHEAD???!?!?
<OtakuTom> punching zombies...what is this, Minecraft? :P
<Phase4> 00,02eggheads
<Phase4> 00,02:3
<superretroworld> Nittany_Discord: then it went in the water, stabbed his heart, got it out of the pool, cut the head off, burned the body, hung the head on the wall and did the same to 12 others when Waw came out
<TheRareP0N3> Otakutom: don't remind me please.
<geeky-brony> no spike nukels fail
<Panda> what is this talk of eggheads :D
<Reikim> This guy is smart.
<SunderlandPony89> WindWhistler: Besides for the xXx1337Sc00p1PZxXx type of people in the CoD community, this side of it is also why it needs to die http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/harassment
<Sylandest> Om: what did I miss?
<Om> OtakuTom: We don't speak about that around these parts.
<RainbowJack> geeky-brony : i am fine getting ready fr work
<SunderlandPony89> WAT. The fapping droids?!
<Om> Sylandest: I volenteered you!
<twilight_sprinkle> pawnch
<geeky-brony> RainbowJack: awesome
<Reikim> When your race opens a portal to Hell, you better damn well have a bad feeling.
<Sylandest> Om: I-wait-for what?
<WindWhistler> You know, you could say the same thing about rabid bronies...
<superretroworld> ocean*
<SunderlandPony89> I heard fapping droids! I'm scarred
*Lewis_Jenkins screams
<WindWhistler> like the ones who sent death threats to a person they thought was responisble for changing Derpy.
<Panda> looks like shizu-chan cant punch those :D
<Om> Sylandest: Yup, you probably wont survive :(
<WindWhistler> emphasis on THOUGHT
<Spriggals> Save the game!
<Sylandest> Om: what was I volunteered for? I might have a chance
<TheRareP0N3> SunderlandPony89: I get on the mic and I instantly have kids yelling at me for using an *OP GUN* whiich is just a mac11, i tell him to watch his f***ing mouth because he's like, 6. and than he threatens to hack me. and that is why i went to pc gaming. :)
<Reikim> WindWhistler: I defer to Faust on this. Hold on, let me find the quote...
<Sylandest> Shizuka: remember to save!
<Om> Sylandest: Everything.
<Spriggals> SAVE IT
<sagas> SAVE Shizuka
<LadyCanary> ALL the things?
<Om> all of em
<Reikim> TheRareP0N3: The CoD community seems to be full of such annoying preteens, I'm afrais.
<LadyCanary> GO SHIZU GO
<Reikim> *afraid
<Sylandest> Om:oh, well...i can survive some of everything, can't I?
<superretroworld> i have OCD over saving
<TheRareP0N3> Reikim: preteens? you mean little kids?
<WindWhistler> Reikim: That sounds like 70% of the Steam community.
<Shizuka> 13went all the way
<Stallion_of_War> TheRareP0N3: "Sir, I believe you have a servear case of, baby voice..."
<twilight_sprinkle> annoying preteens arent as bad as annoying teens
<Reikim> TheRareP0N3: Yes, that.
<Shizuka> 13forgot the plot coupon
<Spriggals> Save it
<Panda> plot cupon? :0
<Om> Sylandest: Lets hope so :) otherwize you would be a poor test subject
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> oh look, you completed an objective, looks like youre gonna get ambused now
<geeky-brony> EA is makeing Dead Space three Co-Op becus the first two wer to scary .......... -_(\
<Om> Panda: Yes please.
<WindWhistler> You mean 12-year-olds?
<SunderlandPony89> WindWhistler: A majority of bronies didn't send the writer of that episode death threats though, only a few people. Nowhere near the about of CoD players who spread hate and bile
<Sylandest> Om: test...subject? *feels sudden aura of doom*
<TheRareP0N3> no. I just hate the 12 year old faze people in my school
<TheRareP0N3> *OH I DID A 360 ASDF CUMSHOT NOSCOPE*
<Om> Sylandest: Eeeyup.
<SunderlandPony89> TheRareP0N3: I envy you. If I had the money and know how I'd swtich to PC gaming in a heartbeat
<WindWhistler> SunderlandPony89: Oh no, I'm not talking about the writer of the episode, I'm talking about a FELLOW BRONY.
<TheRareP0N3> me: i don't. give. a single. f***.
<Sylandest> Panda: plot what now? :D
<geeky-brony> time to go to hell
<Panda> Sylandest: idk... Shizuka said it
<Stallion_of_War> Eggsalad... that will get the teleporter working again
<superretroworld> WindWhistler: who?
<WindWhistler> She wrote to them about removing Derpy because she thought Derpy was offensive.
<Reikim> To anyone who questions to brony fandom, or levels accusations against it...my response is thusly. http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M2E7mFY4K4U/TzGnbOU6MII/AAAAAAAAeAs/33qgjXMkdMQ/s1600/1.PNG
<Sylandest> Panda: hehehe
<owlicious> Fill your pokedex
<SunderlandPony89> WindWhistler: Again, at least a majority of bronies dont do that kind of stuff
<Om> I want my coupon
<Spriggals> SAVE
<Reikim> > never happens again
<WindWhistler> As a result, she got TWENTY PAGES worth of death threats to that one person
<Panda> Sylandest: so... i guess Shizuka has "plot" cupons...
<Sylandest> Om: did you check the newspaper?
<Reikim> Isn't this a prequel?
<Shizuka> 13plot coupon
<TheRareP0N3> Sunderlandpony89: Acutally, getting a pc is quite easy. :P just know what you want, not get tricked by some company
<Sylandest> Panda: yaaayy, coupons
<Panda> Shizuka: what is that?
<Reikim> WindWhistler: Here. http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M2E7mFY4K4U/TzGnbOU6MII/AAAAAAAAeAs/33qgjXMkdMQ/s1600/1.PNG

<Sylandest> Om: *hands you newspaper* check it then
<WindWhistler> Have you guys heard of Yamino?
<Panda> Shizuka: OH!!!! well ponies have muddled that meaning I guess XD
*Om checks newspaper for plot coupon
<flyingfire> 6_9
<Shamroc> Shizuka..can i have one?
<TheRareP0N3> Sunderlandpony89: I had a slimline comp with a integrated graphics card, and I magicly upgraded it to a ATI radeon 6990. :)
<Sylandest> Panda: I...oh god, now i see where you went with that :D
<Reikim> Shizuka: Free. Yeah, sure. What with all the crap you have to do to GET it.
<Shizuka> 13well yeah
<superretroworld> WindWhistler: who was the person that wrote a letter about derpy?
<TheRareP0N3> PC gaming isn't hard, steam + good pc = profit
<Shizuka> 13but it's different from macguffin which is an item central to the plot for no reason
<Panda> TheRareP0N3: :D
<Shizuka> 13plot coupons are "go here, get this, advance story"
<TheRareP0N3> hell i'm gaming on an ATI radeon 3100. :P and that's awful
<SunderlandPony89> TheRareP0N3: Good PC = Money though. Lots of money
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: hay what game stiotin u play
<Shizuka> 13good ambience in this room for the voiceover
<Spriggals> Wait why would this guy give you this thing when you are going into hell?
<Reikim> Shizuka: The MacGuffin is central to the plot for a reason! That reason being plot.
<WindWhistler> superretroworld: Her name is Yamino.
<TheRareP0N3> Sunderlandpony89: Gamble? :D
*Om finds nothing
<Panda> so.... doom 3 has best plot? XD
<Shizuka> 13taking breaks like this so i can scroll up in chat X3
<SunderlandPony89> TheRareP0N3: To young :P
<Sylandest> Om: nothing at all? no coupons?
<Shizuka> 13honestly if you take it for what it is, a reboot of doom 1, it's a good story
<TheRareP0N3> Sunderlandpony89: I'm 13. :P
<Om> Sylandest: Nothing...
<Reikim> > open portal to hell
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: Xbox 360
<Sylandest> Panda: Its a good thing I know multiple definitions, so I don't misinterpret that XD
<Reikim> > explore it
<OtakuTom> You had me at ATI, TheRareP0N3...I've had nothing but problems with any of their cards. I definitely prefer nvidia cards over ATI, even if there is the occasional driver problem.
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: (\
<Greth206> I KNEW this looked like the first one!
<Reikim> This is the human race in a nutshell.
<Panda> Shizuka: any idea what the min specs are off hand? i may get a copy
<Sylandest> Om: then we must try the interwebz
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: /)
<Shizuka> 13for doom 3?
<Shizuka> 13it was 2004, so quite low
<SunderlandPony89> TheRareP0N3: I'm 17, so I'm not to far off from being able to gamble :P
<TheRareP0N3> Otakutom: I'm not getting into video card wars. AGAIN. so i'm stopping this
<Om> Sylandest: I don't think I want to search for those...
<OtakuTom> Panda, this game came out some 8 years ago, so just about any computer should be able to play it.
<Shizuka> 13my laptop's integrated card can pull it off at around 10fps in big rooms, which is where the engine is doing the most work
<Sylandest> Om: then no coupons for any of us...XD
<Om> Sylandest: Somehow I am fine with that.
<HyperMetalLugia> lolfail, it does need Firefox
<Shizuka> 13carmack does good engines... or did, rage flopped really hard
<HyperMetalLugia> but whoop
*MahBoi777 takes all the coupons
<superretroworld> WindWhistler: she probaly must be the most hated brony now
<Sylandest> Om: as am I. no wait, there goes MahBoi777 with them! :O
<HyperMetalLugia> or does it :c
<TheRareP0N3> Sunderlandpony89: I don't gamble. oblivously. *lul* but just get a cheap comp, like a slimline that has a PCI express 16 slot. and than upgrade it. and bam. you got yourselves a dual core + a good video card
<OtakuTom> Uh oh...did I miss something earlier, TheRareP0N3? I definitely wasn't around for a video card war ^^;
<Panda> Shizuka: oh since 2004... my 08 lamtop should be able to handle it eh?
<Shizuka> 13probably
<TheRareP0N3> otakutom: *facepalm*
<WindWhistler> superretroworld: She WASN'T even responsible for it. People just ASSUMED she was.
<TheRareP0N3> oh yeah, this kid at my school
<Om> Sylandest: Oh noooo!
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: still around? http://fabiensanglard.net/doom3/index.php
<Panda> TheRareP0N3: ponies dont have palms ;)
<WindWhistler> Yes, she did write a letter, but no, she wasn't the cause.
<SunderlandPony89> TheRareP0N3: Given my horrible luck with computers, I'm still scared I'd end up screwing something up
<Sylandest> Om: after him! *chases after MahBoi777*
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, thx
<TheRareP0N3> i said comp gaming is better. than you can have 32 gb of ram. :P and xbox has little ram, 1 gb or so
<Om> Panda: Quit being picky!
<TheRareP0N3> him: 1 GB? THAT'S BETTER
<TheRareP0N3> me: LOL.l
<Shizuka> 13<3
<Panda> Om: how am i picky? :D
*Greth206 test
<Om> Sylandest: Nah, thats work

<Sylandest> Om: *stops chasing*...oh, well...good point. *sits* im too tired for work
*Greth206 has Doom on floppy-disks! *yay*

<Spriggals> ACTIVATE
<killerpony7733> yay for teleporter travel
<superretroworld> WindWhistler: is ymino there only evidence?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> hell tunnel of flesh

<DeadpoolDash> who is platinum games?
<MahBoi777> Om: okey dokey, thanks
<Sylandest> SaxyPretender: then hooray! :D
<TheRareP0N3> WindWhistler: Your never going to find a *perfect* community when it comes to popular things. theres going to be the asshats and the good people, in a way we're all the same. :P
<Om> MahBoi777: Why thank me?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Platinum Games is the developer behind Madworld, Bayonetta and Vanquish
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Also, Anarchy Reigns and Metal Gear Rising
<Sylandest> SaxyPretender: oooh! nice! Congrats!
<DeadpoolDash> ....so games I have never played then, okay
<MahBoi777> Om: why not?
<geeky-brony> this is not hell
<Sylandest> SaxyPretender: so what happens now for you?
<WindWhistler> TheRareP0N3: I'm just saying, you say CoD should die because of their community, but quite frankly, this is ridiculous, especially considering it's a KID'S show.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I dunno
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<Om> MahBoi777: Cuse I haz a shirt on.
<Panda> SaxyPretender: :D dat tweet
<Reikim> Bayonetta is good. The world should have more games like Bayonetta.
<LadyCanary> mfw I just remember Lollipop Chainsaw came out. SONOFABITCH I needz it
<WindWhistler> I mean MLP
<killerpony7733> Shizuka dat reaction time
<Sylandest> SaxyPretender: well, congratulaitons anyway. Well done! :)
<Sylandest> *congratulations :D
<MahBoi777> Om: oh okay, nevermind then :1
<TheRareP0N3> WindWhistler: After seeing what's on the internet, i don't consider MLP a kids show anymore. *wink wink*
<SunderlandPony89> LadyCanary: You also needz Bayonetta if you haven't picked it up already
<LadyCanary> I know TT_TT
<OtakuTom> I'm still crossing my fingers for a Bayonetta 2
<LadyCanary> But I spent my money at the convention.
<LadyCanary> I got a White Canary figure. ALL OF MY YES
<WindWhistler> TheRareP0N3: You get my point.
<TheRareP0N3> Anyone happy for the steam summer sales this year? :)
<SunderlandPony89> OtakuTom: Sega said no until futher notice, sadly enough
<SaxyPretender> 0,14one of the employees was saying that we need more feminist critique in video games, but that's actually based on feminist critical theory
<Sylandest> LadyCanary: ahh, thats right. How did it go for you, the convention?
<superretroworld> 7 years and im still nope losing my hopes for a mother 4
<superretroworld> not*
<Reikim> Bayonetta is good because it goes "let's do this Crazy Awesome thing" and when asked why goes "fuck why not" and then goes on to do it and still have a plot deeper than most mainstream games *coughCoDcough*
<SaxyPretender> 0,14he gave a link to a couple of really good essays/books, I mentioned I read an excerpt from one of them and BAM retweet
<LadyCanary> Lovely, Sylandest ^_^ I cosplayed and I got complimented by these 2 girls who MADE their costumes. Self esteem boost GO! ^_^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, YOU GOT A WHITE CANARY FIGURE?
<Polydunami> I like my mother 3 :3
<TheRareP0N3> WindWhistler: Think of it this way, they're both the same. Cod was aimed at adults and teens but it ended up going to kids and little kids, and MLP: FIM was aimed at small children and now it's popular with teens and adults
<OtakuTom> I think more companies need to start pulling a Blizzard and wait 10-12 years between sequels :P
<Sylandest> LadyCanary: indeed, well done! It sounds like you had a great time :)
<LadyCanary> I did ^_^
<LadyCanary> SaxyPretender: YES I DID
<SaxyPretender> 0,14JELLY
<LadyCanary> http://www.entertainmentearth.com/images/AUTOIMAGES/DC30681lg.jpg
<Sylandest> SaxyPretender: you so jelly
<SunderlandPony89> Reikim: You call that plot deep? I call it an incomprehensable mess. I love Bayonetta, but I wouldn't say it has an incredible and deep storyline
<TheRareP0N3> SaxyPretender: HAS A STRANGE ADDICTION WITH TONS OF JARS OF JELLLYYY
<Reikim> So we need more games that just go Crazy Awesome because they can. Also, the video game industry needs more strong female leads.
<LadyCanary> That's her, Saxy ^_^
<owlicious> man, that's funny hearing Tara Strong.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...waaaant
<OtakuTom> TheRareP0N3: It just goes to show that all kids want to be adults and all adults want to be kids :P
<Sylandest> LadyCanary: *whistles* nicely done, Canary!
<Reikim> SunderlandPony89: Yeah, that was bullshit, having not played the game, but then it wouldn't be hard to beat out a lot of today's plots.
<LadyCanary> I looked for Black Canary but they didnt have her. So WHITE CANARY.
<TheRareP0N3> OtakuTom: I don't wanna be an adult. :P
<superretroworld> OtakuTom: good point
<DeadpoolDash> revoltech has better joints for posing
<Panda> wtf? :D
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> lol flying sorpse
<Polydunami> ... Who is White Canary? Sorry for being ignorant :S
<killerpony7733> Blood blood everywhere
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> corpse*
<killerpony7733> :D
<Sylandest> Panda: things happened. resume studying :D
<SunderlandPony89> Reikim: Got a point there
<Reikim> I still maintain that the gaming industry could use more strong female leads. Like Samus (pre Other M, but we're not starting that).
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<TheRareP0N3> Reikim: yup.
<LadyCanary> Word up.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I don't think the new Lara Croft is a step in the right direction
<twilight_sprinkle> theres kinda of a lot of strong females in games already
<superretroworld> TheRareP0N3: when becoming a brony, youre never an adult
<Reikim> New Croft? Explain plz?
<SunderlandPony89> inb4 Tropes Vs Women arguement fires up
<TheRareP0N3> superretroworld: :D
<DeadpoolDash> Well Samus was the first true strong female gaming character I think
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I feel...weird everytime I see the new Tomb Raider game
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: I have yet to see it. What's it like.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Archville
<Panda> SaxyPretender: you and me bother :(
<Reikim> ?
<SunderlandPony89> SaxyPretender: At least Lara Croft has a good VA: Nolan North
<Sylandest> SaxyPretender: I got that feeling too. something's been changed from the dynamic that makes it work usually. I can't put my hoof on it though
<Panda> both*
<TheRareP0N3> superretroworld: i like staying inside half of the time, considering the fact that there's alot of kid's being stolen nowadays.
<TheRareP0N3> superretroworld: so whenever I do go to the store or something, i carry a pocketblade with me just incase. :)
<owlicious> a lot of kids*
<twilight_sprinkle> how do you even die with health regeneration like that
<SaxyPretender> 0,14It's problematic when a lot of the cutscenes they've shown is her getting the ever loving shit beaten out of her
<SunderlandPony89> twilight_sprinkle: You dont
<Shizuka> 13it snaps to the nearest 20
<LadyCanary> Me and my bf have been playing Half Life 2, and we're both loving Alyx. She may not be a "lead" per say, but she kicks so much ass.
<TheRareP0N3> er
<Shizuka> 13moment
<OtakuTom> Personally, I think the reboot of Tomb Raider with filling in Lara's backstory and even giving her a (albeit slight) visual redesign is a step in the right direction. It's really getting rid of the oversexualization of her and making her more human.
<Sylandest> SaxyPretender: indeed. sometimes it helps to build character, but in the vids I've seen, its more like they're just literally trying to tear her to pieces
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<TheRareP0N3> LadyCanary: HALF LIFE 2 IS A BOSS GAME.
<twilight_sprinkle> so it doesnt regenerate all the way tp 100 if below 80?
<Spriggals> No shit
<Shizuka> 13it regenerates up to 80 then
<geeky-brony> TheRareP0N3: (\
<Shizuka> 13or 60, 40, 20, ded
<Sylandest> OtakuTom: you make a good point there
<twilight_sprinkle> ook thats more interesting
<TheRareP0N3> geeky-brony /)
<SunderlandPony89> SaxyPretender: I'm guessing its to make her seem more human and in a desperate survival situation
<Panda> Shizuka: oh i was afraid you were cheating :D
<superretroworld> TheRareP0N3: i mean inside yourself, not the real word, put always carry a pocketblade just in case :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I will give you that point, OtakuTom, but some of the implementation is kinda problematic
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: mfw I open up the new Tomb Raider trailer and get a Lollipop Chainsaw ad :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<Om> Panda: You always thing everyone is cheating.
<superretroworld> but*
<Shizuka> 13only mostly
<TheRareP0N3> superretroworld: inside I keep a 5 inch blade under my computer desk. :)
<LadyCanary> Must..play...Lollipop Chainsaw ;3;
<Shizuka> 13usually i godmode and infinite ammo the whole way
<Panda> Om: i do? 6_9
<Polydunami> ... I'm skeptical.
<Shizuka> 13also
<Om> Panda: so far :D
<Shizuka> 13oblivious, party of this guy
<OtakuTom> It's hard to judge a game when it's not out yet. All the trailers are showing her in trouble because that's what builds up the suspense and interest in the game. It works, though.
<Diglett> 624
<Panda> well thats because you are Shizuka, Shizuka
<twilight_sprinkle> LadyCanary: so if alyx were lead, youd play hl2?...
<Sylandest> Shizuka: indeed, lol

<superretroworld> TheRareP0N3: for what?
<SunderlandPony89> BAH! You surprised me!

<LadyCanary> twilight_sprinkle: Wat. I am playing Half Life 2. Im just saying that she may not be a "lead playable" character, but I still love her. She's freaking awesome.
<Reikim> So, first comment...when the hell did Squenix acquire TOmb Raider?

*Panda waves back to Pinkies4thWall
<twilight_sprinkle> LadyCanary: o i misread. yeah shes pretty cool
<TheRareP0N3> superretroworld: my school sucks too. there's so many people getting pregnant there that it's not even funny
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh hai Pinkies4thWall
*SunderlandPony89 glomps Pinkies4thWall
<OtakuTom> A game like Lollipop Chainsaw (which I'm picking up in the morning) is easier to have fun and energetic trailers, 'cause the game is designed to be comedic and over-the-top. Tomb Raider is much more dramatic, so you're not going to have those over-the-top moments to really have a "fun" trailer.
<LadyCanary> ^
<Om> Oh gawd, so hungry -.-
<twilight_sprinkle> tl;dr
*RainbowJack hugs Pinkies4thWall
<Sylandest> Om: then go get noms
<LadyCanary> OtakuTom: Also, Suda51 is a crazy motherbucker.
<MahBoi777> Om: eat
<Om> Sylandest: Its cooking :C
<Polydunami> Om nom nom
<Sylandest> Om: but its also noms
<Spriggals> DED
<geeky-brony> dead
<OtakuTom> I couldn't agree more, LadyCanary XD
<twilight_sprinkle> lol dat jump
<TheRareP0N3> I watch mlp because it's an uprising show and it acutally is good to think about happy things than to think of some bad things that happen IRL atm.
<LadyCanary> No More Heroes <3
<SunderlandPony89> I've heard Lollipop Chainsaw isn't as crazy as Suda51 normally is
<SaxyPretender> 0,14B-b-b-but
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's Suda
<Sylandest> TheRareP0N3: hear hear! :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14he so crazy
<Shizuka> 13okay that beeped, is there a secret here?
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: I don't know, the trailer looks pretty promising. It looks dramatic in a good way. On top of that, the new design is good; yougner and fresher, fit for a Laura just starting out. What I think it risks is a fandom break like happened with Other M.
<Polydunami> ... Lollipop Chainsaw is a game by Suda51?
<Om> Sylandest: Yes. My name is comically the same as the sounds of eating
<Spriggals> NOCLIP
<SunderlandPony89> Just what I've heard, and I hope it's wrong
<Polydunami> Makes perfect sense O_O
<LadyCanary> Yes Polydunami
<killerpony7733> Shizuka i do not know :S
<TheRareP0N3> noclip. xD
<Sylandest> Om: you see? its in your name! you must go and obtain the noms!
<killerpony7733> Shizuka noclip then
<OtakuTom> I don't care if it's not as crazy as some of his other games, but it fits my "guilty pleasure" criteria pretty well.
<Stallion_of_War_III> ZEUS! YOUR SON HAS RETURNED!
<superretroworld> TheRareP0N3: thats pretty crazy
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm still waiting on more info, but I'm very uncertain
<Stallion_of_War_III> I BRING THE DESTRUCTION, OF OLYMPUS!
<TheRareP0N3> superretroworld: what is
<Om> Sylandest: Funy thing is, I don't eat all that much :I
<Spriggals> I AM KRONOS
<geeky-brony> Stallion_of_War_III: -_(\ lol
<Sylandest> Om: but you did say you were hungry :3
<OtakuTom> I'm love playing games like Oneechanbara, despite the fact that they're pretty bad from a technical point of view.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Guilty pleasures ftw
<SunderlandPony89> DW7 is my guilty pleasure <#
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: It's risking a lot, but I hope it turns out well. I think it has a lot of potential, so long as a) the developers don't derp, and b) the fandom gives it a fair try instead of pulling They Changed It Now They Suck
<SunderlandPony89> <3*
<Om> Sylandest: Yes. Painfully so xD just gota wait now...
<TheRareP0N3> LOL NOCLIP
<twilight_sprinkle> HAAAAAAAAAAAAX

<TheRareP0N3> superretroworld: Yup. Not lying too. :P
<PinkiePieGuy> im back <3
<Diglett> hello
<OtakuTom> And if it's another game like those (girl(s) going around killing zombies in rediculous clothing) AND made by a crazy motherbucker like Suda, there's no way I wouldn't pick it up...lol
<SunderlandPony89> Hell, I've probably bought $25 worth of DLC for DW7
<Sylandest> howdy, PinkiePieGuy
<Shizuka> 13:3
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> hai PinkiePieGuy
<Reikim> You know, in these gameplay trailers, the player needs to shut the hell up.

<PinkiePieGuy> lol just joined, looks a bit like valves engine
<TheRareP0N3> Superretroworld: Pretty much, my school is bad. kids get in random fights, someone put a knife to a kids throat and said *I'M GOING OT KILL YOU N*****" and got sent to jail
<PinkiePieGuy> though the health bar is nothing similar
<Sylandest> TheRareP0N3: that does sound bad. I hope nothing happens to you? :(
<SunderlandPony89> MFW a friend of mine called Lollipop Chainsaw sexist

<Sylandest> TheRareP0N3: still, make sure to be cautious. We don't want to see you getting hurt
<Reikim> Alright, night everyone. <3

<PinkiePieGuy> night reikim
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Reikim: Dream of Ponies
<SunderlandPony89> Sylandest: It doesn't "represent females in a very good way"

<TheRareP0N3> Sylandest: I don't get hurt, as I said. I carry a pocketblade. :P
<PinkiePieGuy> its amazing
<Sylandest> SunderlandPony89: do they detail this explanation, or is it just thrown out there?
<TheRareP0N3> and i'm not really afraid to die, so honestly. :P
<Sylandest> TheRareP0N3: well, thats good and all, but still, I worry for a friend who is put in dangerous situations. Habit of mine, hehe :$
<twilight_sprinkle> red wins!
<LadyCanary> SunderlandPony89: Like I havent heard THAT before. >_< They called freaking SKULLGIRLS sexist. Because they have big tits? Wooooooooow smart. To be fair, the ONLY ONE who actually likes to draw attention to her tits is VALENTINE.
<SunderlandPony89> Sylandest: That's all I got her to say, she HATES debates. Thinks there is no difference between arguements and debates, and she HATES debates
<Squallken> im off you bed, night everyone

<Om> Panda: Yes, you can.
<Sylandest> Om: that would be fine as well, hehe :D
<TheRareP0N3> not FPSs or anything, just a new genre for once.

<Shizuka> 13these demons stand no chance against my wub~
<OtakuTom> SunderlandPony89: There's still some PS exclusive characters that haven't been added to the roster (at least as far as I know) such as Crash Bandicoot, and I'd even argue that Snake from MGS should be in it since most people relate Metal Gear to Playstation instead of Nintendo. Heck, make a deal with Squeenix to put some FF characters in. Final Fantasy was exclusive to PS from 7 through 12!
<TheRareP0N3> anyone know what fourdeltaone is?

<OtakuTom|Nom> Depending on the game, I tend to turn on God Mode...at least if I'm trying just to experience the story.

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka: isnt there a command to kill all around you?
<xxMoopyxx> No i was talking about the software guys
<xmasskills> geeky-brony: since it isnt flawed then you admit it is true your not a real man
<Shizuka> 13if you godmode and overflow a bfg
<geeky-brony> xmasskills: why
<Shizuka> 13sure
<OtakuTom|Nom> I can tell when I'm doing something in the game that I shouldn't be able to do, like take on a whole army of Combine in HL2, but to me it's more fun to experience the story and get to be an unkillable badass X3
<twilight_sprinkle> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: thats never a good thing to use, it also screws up the game
<xmasskills> SunderlandPony89: PONIES can only go so far
<SunderlandPony89> xmasskills: Yes, ALL THE WAY!
<Eddmario> Wait, how do you know how much total ammo for a gun you have?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> twilight_sprinkle: only if you kill necessary characters for the game
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://derpy.me/K9Did Oh Hub
<xmasskills> SunderlandPony89: not on this occasion
<twilight_sprinkle> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: yeah but with kill all you cant choose

*Bronysith glomps trollhunter
<sub06905> all dem glomps 0-0
<trollhunter> what is glomps
*Bronysith glomps trollhunter
<FairysHuff> Glomping involves runnning full steam into someone you like, wrapping your arms around them and tumbling to the ground along with them while still holding on. Once on the ground the holding of said liked person continues and may involve crush squeezy love.
<sub06905> Hug attack :3
<Polydunami> A glomp is a tackle hug :3
<trollhunter> thanks for clearing that up for me
<FairysHuff> Impromptu quick kisses are encouraged after glomping
<Alchemist> like this? http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs49/f/2009/153/8/9/Crazy_Glomp_by_sixtailedwolf.png

<Alchemist> FairysHuff, but its an anonymous chatroom and people dont really start conversations like "Hi, Im XY and Im a girl", so Im sure there are more than just one :D
<FairysHuff> Random info. I just woke up from a series of disturbing dreams. One where I was asleep in bed and for some reason a hot shower was running in my room and flooded the place while I slept. I drowned. O_o

<Polydunami> Alchemist, dat biology fail xD
<Garand> >You will never get to pop a charlie with your A1
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: True that. It's just that all my friends are girls and I would have liked to make one on here as well.
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: as far as I know dreams of suffocating/drowning means that you are sleeping in an uncomfortable position and cant breathe easily. e.g. on your back, or with your pillow in your mouth :D
<Pinkies4thWall|sleep> yeah, it's 3:48. good night

<FairysHuff> Phase4: You should watch the Doctor Who series from the 80s. Some of the best episodes with one of the best Doctors.
<Om> Wow. I did not know it was that late already
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: when was the 4th doctor?
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: I dont remember my dreams: I remember feelings and pictures for about 5-10 minutes and then they are gone.
<OtakuTom> So yea...I just read some news that'll make me a Linux convert (at least on my laptop which is starting to show it's age)...

<OtakuTom> I'm looking at Ubuntu 12.04 (I've used previous Ubuntu releases on other computers) as well as Mint.
<Phase4> 00,02slow for some reason
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: the 7th doctor.
<OtakuTom> FairysHuff: I haven't seen anything before Eccleston yet :(
<Bronysith> OtakuTom: /) i love eccleston
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: I haven't Actually watched DrWho since Sylvester McCoy left. That was back in the 80s
<FairysHuff> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_actors_who_have_played_the_Doctor

<OtakuTom> I'm a bit biased when it comes to my favorite of the 3...I started with Tennant, then Smith, then Eccleston. I didn't really like Eccleston as much as Tennant and Smith.
<Airpuff> Night panda :P
<OtakuTom> Good night Panda
<Om> panda: Night!
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: Don't expect much. It was the 80s ^_^ Hes just funny to watch and does the doctor in a unique and comedic way

<Garand> What is this wizardry?
<Garand> I would have been entirely trapped by the last two
<WallDives> night Polydormant.

<Bronysith> OtakuTom: so now we have a picard vs kirk syndrome right?
*VioletGreySha hugs Phase4
*Phase4 00,02hugs VioletGreySha back
<OtakuTom> My game design teacher at college loves (and I mean LOVES) Doctor Who. I'm pretty sure I was guaranteed an A in any of my classes with her just for being a fan XD
<VioletGreySha> :3
*Bronysith hugs Phase4 with VioletGreySha
<FairysHuff> The doctors seem to be getting younger and younger. Can't say I like that trend. I prefer watching older doctors. They put a unique spin on the show
<VioletGreySha> hay Bronysith ^-^
*Bronysith super glomps VioletGreySha
<sub06905> ded
<trollhunter> not the super glomps

<Ninjazz> Hey there, Bronysith. :)
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: You should watch the series with the first doctor. It has "Proper English" so much fun to listen to ^_^
<Pinkies4thWall|sleep> good night guys
<Ninjazz> Night Night. ^-^
<OtakuTom> FairysHuff: Eventually they'll find some way to write it in that The Doctor finds the ability to circumvent the 12 regenerations rule and keep regenerating into a younger and younger state, eventually starting another spinoff series: Little Doctor Who Adventures.
<VioletGreySha> Ninjazz: hay ploty :P
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: again. as soon as i find a place to watch the old doctors i probably will
<sub06905> night Pinkies4thwall

*Bronysith slaps OtakuTom
<Om> Ninjazz: lol
<Ninjazz> The names I'm given. :$
<VioletGreySha> :3
<FairysHuff> OtakuTom: I hope so. I do prefer the older doctors. Perhaps he can reach a certain age and then just wink out of existence and pop back in again as an old man once more.
<OtakuTom> I take it you don't like my sense of humor, Bronysith? :P
<FairysHuff> OtakuTom: Like a reverse buddhit reincarnation ^_^
<Bronysith> OtakuTom: i dont like kids where kids shouldnt be.
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: There are places you can stream the oldest episodes for free.
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: LINK ME!!!!!
<OtakuTom> I'm still waiting for the day that they announce Patrick Stewart as the 12th doctor XP
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: I don't have them. Let me look em up.
<Bronysith> OtakuTom: John D Lancie would be better
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: ty

<FairysHuff> It's a fairly nice day outside. I want to go out and find a place to relax. But I would prefer to have someone to snuggle with while out there.
<WallDives> damn you all for making me hungry.

<Ascendant> [18:54:46] <%Ascendant> Drake
<Ascendant> [18:54:53] <%Ascendant> I got my report back .-.
<Ascendant> [18:54:55] <%Ascendant> I failed maths
<Ascendant> [18:54:56] <%Ascendant> x-x
<Ascendant> [18:55:11] <%Ascendant> but otherwise, my mum is pretty happy with my report cus' I explained that I'm trying to improve
<Drake> 04"failed" meaning...?
*Drake hugs NS
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: my very special somepony is on opposite coasts with me
<WallDives> Red = ded.
<Om> I'm not affectioate. But most of you know that already
<Drake> 04And if you failed maths I'm surprised your mum didn't go apeshit on you.
*CupcakeWarrior hugs Om
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: Atleast they are in the same country. All my friends are in different countrys ^_^
<WallDives> ^
<Om> I'll eat you >.>
<FairysHuff> Om: All you need is love Om. *Cuddles*
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: i havent even held her in my arms yet. i really want to meet her
<Om> e_o no. thanks
<Ninjazz> Hmmm, Om. What's this?
<Om> Ninjazz: Well.
<Om> uhhh
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Om doesn't like being touched. Which is why we are touching
<Ninjazz> Ah.
<Ascendant> language
<Om> -___-
<Ascendant> Drake, I got 41/100 for my mark
<Ascendant> lmfao
<FairysHuff> Om: Was about to make an innuendo but thought nah better not ^_^
<Ninjazz> Where was Gondor when Om was touched by somepony other than GilDash?
<Om> I think I already caught the inuendoes here...
<FairysHuff> Om: Thats strange cause there weren't any to begin with.
<Om> Ninjazz: They didn't light the fire.
<Viri> 14I failed economics
<Viri> 14:D
<FairysHuff> Om: Your dirty mind working overtime again ^_^
<Drake> 04ouch
<Drake> 04I thought you were good at maths NS
<Dark_Horst> did i just see a rarity?
<Viri> 14I don't know if your school system is screwed up like mine, but if you fail just one school object and you fail its test on September it means that you have failed the year as well
<Om> FairysHuff: No, overtime is when they convince my fingers to say them
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: yes you did
<FairysHuff> Actually thats an interesting social aspect. People who assume anything involving any type of physical contact must be sexual in nature.
<Ascendant> Drake not on the topics that we did
<pony_3587> hii
<FairysHuff> Thats something I've never understood.
<Ascendant> And all of our marks are based off one god damned assessment tasks
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: so is it sexual for me to want to hold my girlfriend in my arms?
<Ascendant> class crap doesn't count for anything
<FairysHuff> Why can't cuddles be cuddles and nothing more?
<Om> I blame america
<Ascendant> that entire mark was based off my first assessment's mark which i screwed up
<trollhunter> hey pony_3587
<FairysHuff> Om: I blame america to ^_^ America is to blame for everything. LOL
<WallDives> ^
<Om> Aye.
<Ninjazz> I wouldn't say that, but half true.
<pony_3587> :)
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: I don't know. Do you have sexual intentions? If so then yes.
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: no. ijust never had a girlfriend before
<Om> I just don't like being touched e_e is that so wrong?
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: and i want to hold her in my arms to know this is real
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: Ah well then since this is your first you will have sexual thoughts and desires no matter what you do. Can't be stopped ^_^
<FairysHuff> Om: It's not wrong. I just find it amusing to tease you ^_^
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: i dont want sex. i just want a relationship
<Bronysith> emotional relationship
<Om> arg /)_-
<WallDives> mfw FairysHuff is Gils in disguise.
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: You'll still have the thoughts and feelings. It's innevitable. You can't control your genetic drives.
<Om> Gillysuit is sick, soooo
<Phase4> 00,02mmmmm
<Phase4> 00,02food
<WallDives> Om, then someone had to fill in.
<Om> No no no. That is quite alright.
<Dark_Horst> so, these ponies a custom mod?
<Dark_Horst> game mode or something?
<Viri> 14:(
*Bronysith slaps Phase4 and takes his pizza
<Phase4> 00,02:<
<Ninjazz> Somepony is always willing to fill in. Doesn't matter who, just that someone will. =__=
<FairysHuff> Dark_Horst: I think they were made by god.
<Ponies47> BACK :)
<Om> Ninjazz: I don't like that rule.
<Dark_Horst> who'S playing btw?
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: me
<Ninjazz> Om, it's the cycle of life. =__=
<Dark_Horst> specify: who are we watching paly
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: Phase4
<Ninjazz> Phase4
<Om> Ninjazz: It can cycle elsewhere
<Ponies47> Dark_Horst: I want to but my computer is to slow :<
<Ninjazz> Om, it rather that it didn't and just laugh at us. :<
<Vordox> what lag loot?
<Dark_Horst> too slow for t2? how does that even work
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: May I ask how old you are?
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: 18
<Ponies47> Dark_Horst: It's 9 years old :<
<Dark_Horst> holy shite
<Ponies47> my computer
<Om> It does like to flex that metephorical diafragm
<Ponies47> Dark_Horst: IKR? I'm saving for a new computer :<
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: Well don't make the relationship mistakes I did. ^_^ Make sure you and your girlfriend are completely and totally honest with eachother and talk out everything rather than argue.
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: well first i want to meet her. shes in california while im in georgia
<FairysHuff> *Face Hoofs when thinking of all the stupid mistakes he's made in the past*
<Saturn> 08,01my god, i'm so tired
*Bronysith crash glomps into Saturn
<Om> the feeling is mutual
<Saturn> 08,01time for a very strong cup o' tea
<FairysHuff> Saturn: Here Saturn. Use my lap as a pillow ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01thank celestia i can work from home...
<Om> FairysHuff: At least you learned something form making mistakes :$
*Saturn 08,01lies on FairysHuff as his kettle boils
<Informant_Pony> Hey there, Saturn.
<Ponies47> Saturn: I think you might wanna try somthing called SLEEP. Somepony told me about this but I have no idea how to this thing called sleep. :<
<Bronysith> Saturn: how are you mate? want some pizza?
<FairysHuff> Om: Yeh... it's just took me over 12 years to learn them ^_^ Uuuuugh.... so much face hoofing.
<Bronysith> BRB EVERYPONY i need to take a shower
<Saturn> 08,01Ponies47: i've been trying, but my body doesn't seem to understand the conept of night
<Om> FairysHuff: Cover it with a pillow :\
<trollhunter> give that pizza back to Phase4 bronysith
<FairysHuff> Om: Huh?
<Ponies47> Saturn: It's almost 6:00 AM I haven't tryed this so called sleep yet.
<Om> so you can facehoof into the pillow xD
<Saturn> 08,01i actually went to bed at a decent time last night
<Ponies47> Throws a pillow at Om
<FairysHuff> Om: aaah ^_^ heh
<Ponies47> Saturn: I never do :P
<Saturn> 08,01just after 1am
<Om> Nuu ill fall asleep e_e
<Saturn> 08,01Ponies47: my 9-5 job is now 12-8
<Om> FairysHuff: Sory if I make little to no sense at times. Not running on much brainpower anymore
<Ponies47> Saturn: I see. Well I'm only 14 so I don't have a job :P
<FairysHuff> A lesson I learned about relationships. Always make sure your otherhalf knows you can't read their minds and get them to talk everything out.
<FairysHuff> Om: Tis fine. I will occassionally go crazy just for the fun of it.
<Om> It is quite fun...
<FairysHuff> Another extremely important relationship lesson. FREAKING RELAX!!!!! O_o
<Om> ReLAAAAAAAAAAAX!
<FairysHuff> Om: Seriously ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01a lesson I've learned about relationships: seducing your ex's new boyfriend is hilarious and fun

<Drake> 04Goddamnit
<Drake> 04I keep forgetting that
<Ascendant> !swearkick off
<ScriptBot> Swear kickers are now off.
<Drake> 04NS you're a bad influence.
<Ascendant> lol
<Drake> 04Also sorry for the late reply.
<Ascendant> I've been told that several times
<FairysHuff> Saturn: If he was that easy to seduce he couldn't have been that much of a BF in teh first place.
<Saturn> 08,01nota bene: this generally only works if you're on good terms with your ex, and they are polyamorous
<Ascendant> by you of all people
<Om> FairysHuff: I know, I have read...Some book...about it... oy...Twi moment /)_-
<Ascendant> anyway
<Ascendant> what were you saying, Drake?
<Ponies47> BRB
<Drake> 04Denying that you were a bad influence me is tantamount to idiocy.
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: see the nota bene
<Ascendant> hurr
<Ascendant> Oh yeah Drake
<Ascendant> Have you read Othello?
<Drake> 04How'd you screw up your assessment task?
<Drake> 04Nope.
<Drake> 04I've been reading Brothers of Blood from the Dragonkeeper series.
<FairysHuff> Saturn: Lucky ^_^
<Drake> 04Book 4 hellyesssss
<Dark_Horst> what's the enforer?
<MadSurge> Saturn: O U :D
<WallDives> bleh, relationships...
<Om> ^
<Ascendant> Dragonkeeper has a 4th book? WHAT?
<Drake> 04ayup
<Drake> 04recently released
<Ascendant> o___________-o
<Ascendant> woooooah
<Ascendant> okay
<Informant_Pony> ^^
<Ascendant> I want to get I, Iago and Iago: A novel first
<Ascendant> also I'm doing an Othello viewing task at school
<FairysHuff> Something I don't think people understand is that physical contact is only sexual when theres sexual intent in the persons mind whos initiating it. Otherwise it's just friendly affection.
<Ascendant> and I'm playing Iago
<Drake> 04My school librarian was just like "Hey, I know you like this series so I thought I'd tell you about the sequel"
<Drake> 04lol
<FairysHuff> The west has become overly sensitive to such things
<Ascendant> who's basically a manipulating, "evil" villain
<Ascendant> in the play
<Ponies47> BACK :)
<Om> No kidding.
<Drake> 04I figured
<Ascendant> Basically in my part
<Drake> 04since you drone on about him all the goddamn time and seem to be in love
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: or in the one who is not initiating it
<Ascendant> I have to play 3 different "faces" of him
<Drake> 04Asexually, platonic love. Somehow.
<Ponies47> *Noms on Wonka Bottle Caps*
<Ascendant> 1. When he's alone doing his soliloquys
<Drake> 04I'm not sure how that works though.
<Saturn> 08,01if you hug me and i smile slyly at the boner it's given me, it's probably sexual
<Ascendant> 2. When he's with another soldier guy, being all blokey
<Ascendant> 3. When he's with Othello, being serious and "honest"
<Ascendant> So
<Ascendant> I'm not an actor
<Informant_Pony> o__o
<Informant_Pony> >.>
<FairysHuff> Saturn: True. But theres no way for the intiator to know that unless the other person does or says something. We arent mind readers
<Ascendant> I'm going to have fun failing
<Alchemist> what??
<Ascendant> Anyway
<Ascendant> piano time
<Dark_Horst> an then there's people who dont feel comfortable getting hugged by random strangers
<Drake> 04aww
<Drake> 04bye
<Ascendant> Also, my english teacher is awesome
*Drake hugs
<Ascendant> guess what he put in my report
*Ascendant hugs back
<Saturn> 08,01fair enough, but it's a two person subjective transaction
<Drake> 04A
<FairysHuff> Dark_Horst: I don't hug strangers. Just people I know.
<Viri> 14see you
<Ascendant> "<name> is an enthusiastic student who is excited and inspired by Shakespeare"
<Ascendant> @ Drake
<Ascendant> xD
<Ascendant> 'tis true though
<Saturn> 08,01i hate that fact that physical contact is mostly seen as sexual in this society
<Ascendant> I've had lengthy discussions with him about various Shakespeare play
<Drake> 04hurr
<Ascendant> plays
<Ascendant> :}D
<FairysHuff> Saturn: True but that shouldn't stop the affection. Otherwise we'd have a society like we have now. Everyone afraid of physical contact
<Ascendant> but hey
<Alchemist> I dont hug at all, its not common to hug friends over here, only girl/boyfriends.
<Saturn> 08,01i can cuddle with my friends without it being sexual at all
<Ascendant> Hamlet and Othello plays are <3
<Drake> 04Shakespeare is only fun for me when we do tragedies.
<Ascendant> I'm in the middle of King Lear
<Ascendant> Yes
<Alchemist> Only hug when drunk.
<Drake> 04I'm doing goddamn Taming of the Shrew
<Drake> 04.u.
<Ascendant> His trag-
<Ascendant> haha
<Drake> 04I'm Petruchio
<Drake> 04I get to be the @$$hole :D
<Ascendant> I should read that one
<Saturn> 08,01hell, one time when i had sex it was completely non-sexual.
<Ascendant> Apparently it's pretty good
<FairysHuff> The important thing to do is reject the common social view of physical affection and form your own. Then act on it.
<Viri> 14I did the theatral version of Othello twice
<Viri> 14as Iago
<Viri> 14:D
<Informant_Pony> How is that even possible?!
<Ascendant> Lucky, Viri
<Drake> 04I did your mum
<Drake> 04twice
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: how does that even work?
<Ascendant> I'm playing Iago in Act IV Scene I
*Drake dies
<Saturn> 08,01Informant_Pony: we were both very drunk
<Ascendant> where Iago has like, 3 different faces
<Viri> 14lol
<Ascendant> when he's alone, when he's with Cassio, and when he's with Othello
<Ascendant> wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<FairysHuff> I know what Saturn means. I hate to admit I haven't enjoyed any of the sex I've had. >_>
<Ascendant> I'm not an actor so fun
<Alchemist> non sexual sex sounds like dry water tbh.
<Ponies47> pfft relationships *Noms on more Wonka Bottle Caps*
<Viri> 14I remember it was tedious as hell
<FairysHuff> But I have a unique brain ^_^
<Viri> 14but also very fun
<Alchemist> sex without affection is another thing.
<Informant_Pony> And you like... uhhhh, let's just... you know?... Uhh... or something? How does that work?!
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: well, mostly is was just trying to be ironic
<Saturn> 08,01*i
<Drake> 04There's like 4 or 5 people holding the class together for me.
<Saturn> 08,01so it's not entirely true
<Drake> 04No one else cares about acting their parts :'D
<Drake> 04People say I should have gone into drama class.
<Drake> 04I take it as a compliment
<Om> Well you made my brain implode.
<Ascendant> Yeah Viri
<Ascendant> Iago is an awesome character
<Ascendant> favourite shakespeare villain
<Ponies47> *Explodes*
<Viri> 14I remember I made people laugh when I was rubbing my hands and talking to the public xDD
<Saturn> 08,01however, there is a guy in Edinburgh who i'm friends with, and it's completely impossible for us to have sex, because we're both too silly
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ponies47> *Respawns*
<Ascendant> I don't see Iago as rubbing his hands
<FairysHuff> Well another piece of advice. Only have sex with someone you truly care for. That way it will actually mean something and won't be boring as hell to the point you fall asleep during >_>
<Ponies47> STILL GOT IT! :p
<Informant_Pony> Chat has become sex. O__O
<Ascendant> I see him as slightly excited... sorta, and very very confident
<WallDives> FairysHuff, TRUE DAMN STORY.
<Ascendant> I don't think he's necessarily evil
<Viri> 14there was a part of it while he was talking to Othello
<FairysHuff> Saturn: You live in Scotland?
<Ascendant> the one where he goes "Now will I talk to Cassio about Bianca"
<Ascendant> "He, when he hears of her / cannot refrain from the excess of laughter"
*Om has nothing to add to the conversation xD
<Ponies47> *Curls up in a ball and starts sucking on hoof over all this talk*
<Saturn> 08,01the first time we tried, he asked me to talk dirty (which i'm terrible at), and i ended up pinning him down and whispering "now bake me a cake, bitch" into his ear
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: i do
<FairysHuff> WallDives: I learned that lesson the hard boring way ^_^
<trollhunter> its the time of night when the chat turns to sex
<Viri> 14lol
<Alchemist> :D
<WallDives> FairysHuff, me too >.>
<Viri> 14maybe slightly different screenplay x3
<Viri> 14also hi HML
<Saturn> 08,01inb4 FairysHuff lives in scotland too and knows who i am from that story
<FairysHuff> Saturn: I am also in Scotland ^_^ At last a fellow Scot pony.
<Ponies47> *Keeps sucking on hoof over all this sex talk*
<Informant_Pony> Mfw
<trollhunter> where is everyone from
<Ascendant> "As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad; and his unbookish jealousy / will prove Cassio's gestures, smiles and light behaviours quite in the wrong"
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: awesome! where abouts in scotland are you?
<WallDives> trollhunter, united States.
<Ascendant> not that part?
<Ascendant> er
<Viri> 14uhm
<Informant_Pony> Some island in the pacific ocean.
<Ponies47> <- Wisconsin Brony right here ::)
<Om> Bad young Us of a
<FairysHuff> Saturn: Right in the middle. In between the cities of Falkirk and Stirling.
<Saturn> 08,01nice
<Viri> 14I think I recall the jealousy and the laugh
<FairysHuff> Saturn: You?
<Viri> 1414/didinitalian
<trollhunter> Australia for me
<Alchemist> Hungary.
<Ascendant> was it the one where he's like "Thus credulous fools are caught / and chaste dames even thus, all guiltless, meet reproach"
<Saturn> 08,01i'm in the East just by St Andrews
<Ascendant> where Othello-
<Ascendant> OH
<Drake> 04ohai HML
<Ascendant> the jealousy one?
<Ascendant> that's Act III Scene III
<FairysHuff> Saturn: Thats just north of Edinburgh right?
<Drake> 04How the hell can you quote that
<Drake> 04Unless you're looking it up
<Viri> 14yes
<Drake> 04sneaky
<Saturn> 08,01eeyup
<Viri> 14x3 Othello is quite interesting Drake
<Viri> 14read it :D
<Ascendant> "O beware, my lord, of jealousy; 'tis the green-eyed monster that doth mock the meat it feeds on"
<Ascendant> Drake I know these lines off by heart
<Viri> 14and make a WTF face when you read the ending
<FairysHuff> Saturn: How would you feel about hanging out sometime? ^_^ In a friends only manner.
<Ascendant> I love Iago's lines at the end
<Ascendant> where he's like
<Ponies47> *Throws a sandvich into the middle of the chat*
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: of course, i was just about to ask if you wanted to meet ^.^
<Om> I'll be sure to keep what I have learned in mind, if the situation ever occurs.
<Ascendant> "Demand me nothing; what you know, you know. / From ere forth I will never speak word."
<FairysHuff> Saturn: Awesome! ^_^
<trollhunter> grab sandvich
<Drake> 04that's
<Drake> 04what
<Ascendant> and "I bleed, sir, but not killed." *smirk*
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: do you know Sketchy Sounds from EFR?
<FairysHuff> Om: And what have you learned?
<FairysHuff> Saturn: Nope.
<Ascendant> I know some of hamlet too, though considerably less
<Drake> 04Shakespearean plays confuse me, since each new line has a capital letter.
<Saturn> 08,01ah, okay
<Viri> 14yeah, he was such a b*****d in the italian translation
<Drake> 04Sometimes I get around it but I usually don't

<FairysHuff> Saturn: I don't know anyone in Dundee

<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: ah, okay
<Saturn> 08,01well, i guess scotland is the right place for you
<Saturn> 08,01there's no sunlight
<FairysHuff> Saturn: Very true ^_^
<Ponies47> trollhunter: Guess I'm just gonna ahve to wait until she goes to work in about 2 hours :<
<FairysHuff> Saturn: I die if the temp gets above 15
<Ponies47> *have
<Om> No sunlight?
<Om> Hmmm.
<Viri> 14I think 50GB monthly might be enough
<FairysHuff> Om: Other than in summer Scotland is usually overcast all year
<Viri> 14but I'd be paranoid everyday about not having enough left for the next days xD
<trollhunter> ponies47: that sucks
<XAX> FairysHuff: ...seriously?
<Om> FairysHuff: I kinda like overcast
<XAX> lol
<FairysHuff> Om imagine a slate grey roof of unbroken cloud. Thats Scotland mostly all year round.
<Drake> 04aye
<Ponies47> trollhunter: Yeah. I all got is Wonka Bottle Caps but all that's left is cherry flavor. Candy is not a good breakfest :<
<trollhunter> hey XAX did you just get on
<Ponies47> Ohai XAX :)
<Om> FairysHuff: I can imagine that. Sounds a lot more stable then the weather I am used to
<FairysHuff> XAX: Yus seriously ^_^
<XAX> Nah been here for an hour or so :(
<FairysHuff> Om: Oh it's not stable at all ^_^
<XAX> Hai everyone, I guess.
<trollhunter> Ponies47; well make it count
<Bronysith> IM BACK everypony
<FairysHuff> Saturn: So what should we do about planning our friendly meet up?
<Ponies47> trollhunter: Okie doki loki. Don't really like cherry flavor but it will ahve to do. Atleast I got plenty of water bottles in my room :)
<Om> FairysHuff: Probably not, but I used to live in a very fun place for weather xD
<Ponies47> *have
*Bronysith glomps Saturn
<FairysHuff> Om: if you love violent wind and rain you'll love Scotland.
<Ponies47> Ohai Bronysith :)
<Viri> 14x_x I don't think that letting new posts from Forum Games show up in "Recent Posts" is a good idea
<trollhunter> sorry XAX you just havent said anything in abit
<Viri> 14it'd be nicer if you could control which sections to include there, maybe the most interesting for you x3
<XAX> trollhunter: It's alright :)
<Om> FairysHuff: Never have been fond of wind, but havent really lived with out it xD I was talking more along the lines of drastic changes in temerature
<Viri> 14my opinion, of course
<FairysHuff> Om: Though because of global warming I've noticed a distinct change in the weather in the past 20 years ~_~ This saddens me.
<pony_3259> chats

*Bronysith glomps Saturn
<Ponies47> *Glomps Bronysith with the superglomper6000* :)
<FairysHuff> Saturn is now regretting her words LOL ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01but seriously, how about you come to st andrews? it's accessible by train (get off at Leuchars), but the bus is bitchingly expensive to get in from the station
<Om> I don't like the sound of the word lube sounds weird.
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: oh, uh, Saturn is a he, btw
<Ponies47> Om: lube. TROLOLOLOLOLO :p
<Phase4> 00,02class switch in time for map change

<Om> Ponies47: Try saying Threnody out loud, it rolls off the tongue~

<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: people are confusing me for a woman again! it's hilarious!
<dishwasher_PRIME> #Dashiesauce
<FairysHuff> Saturn: And would it be possible to meet in say Edinburgh. I know how to get there as I used to live there. And I know the centre of the city better.
<Ponies47> Om: LE GASP! IT DOES! :o
<FairysHuff> Saturn: Plus I'd feel safer meeting someone for the first time somewhere I'm familiar ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: sure! i'm always open to excuse to go to edinburgh
<Om> Saturn: I thought of you as an it, until you showed your fantastic mane and beard
<Saturn> 08,01also, i used to live there too
<Saturn> 08,01i absolutely love the place
<FairysHuff> Saturn: Edinburgh Fringe Festival soon ^_^
<trollhunter> ok well Im out bye everyone
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: oh yes! some of my best memories of Edinburgh are from the fringe
<Om> Later
<FairysHuff> trollhunter: NO DON'T GO! *Grabs leg and gets dragged along the floor*
<XAX> Bai trollhunter
<Saturn> 08,01being unemployed during the Fringe is actually pretty awesome
<Saturn> 08,01sleep all day, go to free comedy shows every night
<Ponies47> DAT RAINBOW FACTORY! :D
<Saturn> 08,01well, sometimes i'd busk during the day
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, that's basically what i'd do all summer
<Saturn> 08,01well, all august
<XAX> Rainbow factory? Where? :D
<FairysHuff> Saturn: I am perpetually unemployed. ^_^ I didn't know why until I was diagnosed with Aspergers late last year. Then everything made sense.
<Ponies47> Wow 6:26 AM and I'm wide awake. :P

<Ponies47> *6:27
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: aspergers? better get a job in computing :P
<FairysHuff> Computing tech moves far to fast to keep up with. It's changing all the time.
<Viri> 14Lighty :3
<Saturn> 08,01ah, you probably have a touch of OCD too, then
<FairysHuff> Saturn: How so?
<Lighty> 13Viri :3
<Saturn> 08,01or am i getting it confused with aspergers?
<Saturn> 08,01i know that one of them is the one where you need routine and don't like change, as one possible symptom
<FairysHuff> Saturn: I don't know ^_^ You'll have to explain what your thinking.
<FairysHuff> Hang on. I'll link you.
<FairysHuff> http://www.autism.org.uk/about-autism/autism-and-asperger-syndrome-an-introduction/what-is-asperger-syndrome.aspx
<Viri> 14how are you? ^^
<Saturn> 08,01i've often thought that i might have mild aspergers. i certainly fit the profile, but i've never wanted it confirmed or diagnosed, as it doesn't really affect me in a negative way, and i don't want to be labelled
<Bronysith> Saturn: i have autism
<Saturn> 08,01plus, with me, it's probably just neuroses, and not actually aspergers
<Saturn> 08,01though i have no idea
<FairysHuff> Saturn: Well if your able to hold down a job and have some form of life and enjoy things then it doesn't matter. I have a hard time holding down jobs ^_^
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Hey Bromies :D
<Saturn> 08,01i tend to force myself to do the opposite of what my brain tells me to, in regards to social interaction
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> hey Saturn and others
<FairysHuff> Saturn: My diagnoses has helped me as I don't hate myself as much anymore for not being able to cope with thing other people cope with on a daily basis.
<Saturn> 08,01so i end up being pretty sociable, but sometimes things can trip me up (being so tightly wound, because i'm forcing the social behaviour on myself) and make me run away from social interactions (sometimes literally)
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: i always thought that it was my fault that i couldnt be social. im just glad the thing i have has a name
<FairysHuff> Saturn: I tried that social interaction mask for a few years. It was incredibly phsyically and emotionally exhausting. So I stopped.
<Saturn> 08,01to be perfectly honest, i'm more convinced it's the neuroses is growing up with a twin brother
<Saturn> 08,01*of
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: What is it you have?
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: autism
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: aye, i know what you mean; but to be honest, i love it
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: What level?
<Ponies47> *Tiphoofs away from Alicorn_Prince_Shane*
<Saturn> 08,01hey Alicorn_Prince_Shane
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol wut Ponies47
<FairysHuff> Saturn: I get overwhelmed easily and have to remove myself ^_^
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Saturn: hows dat sexy orange hair of urs
<Saturn> 08,01Alicorn_Prince_Shane: about to be pinked
<Ponies47> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: You don't wanna knowwhat time it is :P
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Saturn: LEGASP
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Saturn: u have to stream after u dye it please
<Ponies47> I was pinked last night! :d

*Bronysith1 glomps Sylandest
<FairysHuff> Aaaah dyed hair. I miss my shocking pink hair with dark blue tips.
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, one of the symptoms of aspergers is an inability to understand jokes
<Saturn> 08,01and... well, who here would say i'm not a funny person?
*Sylandest hugs Bronysith1
<Om> morning Sylandest
<Sylandest> morning, Om! :)
<FairysHuff> Saturn: I'll be a pain in the ass then ^_^ You'll probably have to logically explain all your jokes. LOL
<Sylandest> Saturn: you alwas make me laugh
<Sylandest> *always
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: ah, don't worry; i grew up with an indian mother, so i'm used to difficulties in humorous communication
<FairysHuff> Saturn: Wow... that must have been interesting.
<Saturn> 08,01ha! yes, it certainly was
<Bronysith1> FairysHuff: i guess thats why ive had a hard time getting a grilfriend really
<Saturn> 08,01the indian sense of humour is very different to the british
<Om> I don't have any head things that I know of. I'm just a tad crazy
<Lighty> 13tired, as always you?
<FairysHuff> Saturn: I tend to have a more intelligent or silly sense of humour more Gintama or BillBaily.
<Bronysith> thats much better
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: then we will get along just swell
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: I know what you mean. All my relationships have failed badly before my diagnoses.
<Alchemist> Om: one tip: dont try to analyze yourself based on wiki articles. If you really want to know if there is any condiction you have better see a doctor about it :)
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: i feel really uncomfortable really going out
<FairysHuff> Saturn: Groovy ^_^ I love bills metaphysical pub jokes.
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: Your not the only one ~_~
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: yes! my god, those are hilarious!
<Saturn> 08,01have you seen any of Tim Minchin's stuff?
<Saturn> 08,01oh, also
*Sylandest hugs Bronysith and FairysHuff
<Om> Alchemist: Pah, what does the internet know? And doctors for that matter, they have almost never been right the first time =_=
<Saturn> 08,01Simon Amstell's stand-up is absolutely hilarious
<Ponies47> Well it is Tim Allrn
<Sylandest> There's somepony for everypony out there :)
<Ponies47> *Allen
<Viri> 14x3 I'm ok. Pain is going away
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: LOVE GLOMPS OF DOOM!
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: unless im going to like a nerd convention. cause then im surrounded by people with common interests
<Lighty> 13pian? where? :o
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: :D all to cheer up the day! hehe
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: dragoncon. it is going to be so awesome /)^3^(\
<Alchemist> Om: Im sorry to hear that. Fortuantely I have no reason not to trust doctors...yet.
<Ponies47> Hey, how's about a wanna have a pizza pie>?
<Om> Alchemist: I suppose thats good xF
<Om> xD*
<Viri> 14body xP gym workout was very hard last time
<Viri> 14arms, chest, legs, sides..
<Lighty> 13ouwwie
<FairysHuff> I recently bought a pen camera to keep me safe when out and about. I have been badly bullied as a child and physically assaulted by strangers as an adult. So makes me even more nerouvs to go out or be around others.
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: thats why i carry a katana
<FairysHuff> So if anything happens again atleast I will have video evidence of it for police.
<Phase4> 00,02last round for me
<FairysHuff> It makes me feel a little safer. Though having someone with me would be better
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: dont you have a close circle of a few friends you can go out with?
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, people confuse you with a woman?
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: No. I'm completely isolated. All my friends are online.
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: thats not good... :(
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: know this my friend
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: you are never alone
<Viri> 14especially chest xP
<Viri> 14I couldn't cross my arms xDD
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: I find it hard making and keeping friends as people find it hard being around me.
<Om> FairysHuff: Mine are all online now
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: what Bronysith said. You're never alone :)
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: all the time
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: i will always be with you through the force. Use my strength, share with me
<Lighty> 13i cant cross my toes when im too long in the cellar without thick clothes
<Saturn> 08,01mostly on the internet
<Phase4> 00,02...how
<FairysHuff> Bronysith ^_^ lol thanks.
<Viri> 14o.o
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: no im serious
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: like-minded people too?
<Saturn> 08,01but some people see me from behind, and are very shocked when i turn around and show off my massive black beard
<Ponies47> I WUB ALL OF YOU! <3
*Sylandest wubs Ponies47 also :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wooo must get some sleep, Later everyone
<Saturn> 08,01also, anyone in the UK who would like to sell stuff: http://ukofequestria.co.uk/attachments/buck-poster-v3-png.1663/
<Bronysith> i wub you too Ponies47
<Ponies47> Night night TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: Yes. My mind works in almost complete logic and i can't read the social and body language cues others can. This strains friendships for people who can.
<Ponies47> dawwwwww so much wub :)
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: besides, didnt you and Saturn agreed to hang out sometime? I think thats a start :)
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: Yes. And I am not ashamed to admit that I am scared shitless about it ^_^ LOL
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: But it all about controlling my fear as best I can.
<Saturn> 08,01# a simple mare living simple dreams / a rumour that's not quite as it seems #
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: its a fair thing to be worried about. But all you have to keep in mind is you already know Saturn. All it is is just meeting up and hanging out :)
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: True. But like most people with Aspergers I am Fluttershy incarnate. ie very quiet. Makes first meetings awkward.
<Ponies47> EVERY PARTY NEED'S A POOPER! THAT'S WHY WE INVITED YOU! PARTY POOPER PARTY POOPER! :p
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: I dont really know what to say to encourage you, so Ill just shut up and hope the best for you :)
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: don't worry about it too much; i'm so chill that penguins flock to me
<Saturn> 08,01i have been known to wear polar bears.
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: what Saturn said, haha! :D
<cow334> man i suck at team fortress but ehh it's still fun to play
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: It's fine. Don't worry. You don't have to encourage me. ^_^ I've learned so many lessons over the years that I think I may finally have a philosophy that I can act on.
<Saturn> 08,01hence the saying: "wow, this curry is great! what's in it?" "bear meat."
<FairysHuff> Saturn: Awesome cakes and dwarven bakes ^_^
<Ninjazz> DAFUQ YOU SAY ABOUT RARITY?!
<cow334> Saturn: what is bear meat?
<Saturn> 08,01cow334: meat from a bear
<Bronysith1> GET OUT OF MY PC DERPY
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: what-what?
<cow334> Saturn: oh god is it good
<Saturn> 08,01cow334: bearly
<Om> Ninjazz: Look who decided to return
<Ninjazz> Grrr. Nvm.
<cow334> Saturn: ew i wouldnt try it
<Saturn> 08,01cow334: why not?
<Sylandest> Om: he reawakens, hehe :D
<Ponies47> I have been a bad pony. I stay up to late :(
<FairysHuff> One thing I think everyone should know about me. I HATE drama.
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: never run a convention, then
<FairysHuff> Saturn: I never intend to ^_^ LOL
<cow334> Saturn: well cause it's bear meat like that is pretty wrong like would you eat it well i think it is me being wierd i never tryd it so i cant decide how it taste like
<Om> FairysHuff: I treid to think of something whitty to say, but my mind kept drifting to cats and watermellons
<FairysHuff> Saturn: One of my ex's was quite into creating drama. As you can imagine I didn't know how to deal with it and freaked out ^_^ LOL
<FairysHuff> Om: Witty and funny huh? How about BUTT CHEESE!
<FairysHuff> Om is that good. Plus I just farted again.
<Sylandest> Om: what is this "garlics stuff" Nin is telling me about?
<Om> FairysHuff: but cheese is moldy :(
<Om> Sylandest: I made something up~
<Ponies47> I'm gonna go AFK for the enxt hour or so. I gotta fake sleep so mom doesn't see I was being abad pony and staying up late. BYE ALL!
<Sylandest> Om: yes, but what did you make up exactly? I'm curious, lol
<FairysHuff> Om: Brie Butt ^_^ heheh..... I laugh at my own jokes.
<Ponies47> *next
<Bronysith> ROSE! NO!!!!!!
<Sylandest> laters Ponies47
<Ponies47> *a bad
<Alchemist> FairsHuff: same here. She made a big deal out of nothing but it later turned out that it was because she had a problem with our relationship but instead talking about it she canned her feelings, lashing out occasionally, and eventually cheating on me.
<Om> FairysHuff: Thats good!
<Om> Sylandest: Ask him.
<Viri> 14brb
<Phase4> 00,02thats it for me tonight
<Ninjazz> Om, no you tell him.

<Ninjazz> :D
<Bronysith> may the force be with you Phase4 ty so much for streaming
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: Right there with you. I will never understand people who just can't talk things out.

<Saturn> 08,01you eat pig meat?
<Saturn> 08,01surely that's just as wrong?
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: there are people like you and then there are people who NEED drama. Like those women who actually like arguing with their boyfrinds over nothing. Its a different world and I wont understand it either.
<Om> Ninjazz: You are right, so go tell him.
<Phase4> 00,02not going to bed , just ending tf2 early
<Phase4> 00,02might stream a video series from linux
<Saturn> 08,01maybe it's only wrong if the animal is fluffy and cute...
<Bronysith> Phase4: DR WHO!!!!!
<Ninjazz> Om, I don't remember.
<Sylandest> Om: just tell me the story you came up with! XD
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, dont have any downloaded
<Om> Sylandest: I tild him you had to consume much garlic for a rash xD
<Sylandest> Om: whaa....how does that even work? :D
<FairysHuff> Someone should stream Big Trouble in Little China on here at some point in the future ^_^ Classic.
<Bronysith> "Do i look like an out of bounds sorta guy?" man i love dr who
<Om> Sylandest: I'm not the one who took the story without a wink of convern
<FairysHuff> Oh crap... My mother has arrived in the house. >_> *Sigh*
<Ninjazz> Om: Not sure how I bough that one... :D
<Ninjazz> bought*

<Lil_B|SchoolStuff> I wish i could speak english as well as wrek... but i'm horrible at speaking the "th" I just can't do it right :/
<alexxm> i approve of all orgies that may happen
<Cypresswolf> I'm getting - no, DEMANDING a refund from TaoBao, 2 weeks after sending payment for the Derpy toy they had on site and they still are in processing phase - the seller can't get anymore but didn't bother telling me or sending me a refund until I sent them an email :|
<Jim> Especialy if they involve ice cream
<pyrocatboy> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5lhn22qEm1r8f79so1_1280.png
<Saturn> 08,01Cypresswolf: man, that sucks
<Saturn> 08,01but that's why i didn't order one
<Cypresswolf> Oh and it gets better - They kept the page up, but changed the picture of the item to a different item
<pyrocatboy> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5lhn22qEm1r8f79so2_1280.png
<FairysHuff> Orgies, icecream and bondage. Brilliant night out.
<Cypresswolf> only $20, but lesson learned!
<alexxm> Cypresswolf this is why i only trust amazon or play.com
<pyrocatboy> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5lhn22qEm1r8f79so3_1280.png
<pyrocatboy> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5lhn22qEm1r8f79so4_1280.png
<Saturn> 08,01okay, this may be slightly hypocritical, but let's keep it PG-14 in here before thigns get out of hand...
<FairysHuff> OMG!! I just remembered some old 80s Scottish slang for cool! "Galas" ^_^
<Cypresswolf> Disputing it with paypal right now, they were supposed to have cancelled it when they could not recieve anymore to sell :|
<pyrocatboy> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5lhn22qEm1r8f79so5_1280.png

<Lambo> *facepalm at the content*
<pyrocatboy> Saturn ok

<ACS13123> O HAI :)
<Jim> ohai ACS13123
<derpy_pony> thx pyrocatboy :)
<derpy_pony> hi ACS13123
<alexxm> hey ACS13123 hows your day been
<otakon> hiya ACS13123
<ACS13123> alexxm: it's been good
<Cypresswolf> Bought a preorder Derpy through ebay, seller lives in north Texas, seems alright, and offered a refund in the event he couldn't get ahold of them while at Comic Con next month
<otakon> all I hear is CLICK CLICK CLICKETY CLICK CLICK CLICK.
<otakon> and GLUG
<otakon> and thus I KILLED THE CHAT
<Jim> I never pick up the white weapons
<MadSurge> I like Wrek's voice :)
<otakon> Jim: you can sell them to pay for repairs at least
<Jim> I found they were only worth like 10 coins or something
<Saturn> 08,01pyrocatboy: link to the tumblr?
<Saturn> 08,01i wanna see the rest of it
<otakon> God, I remember when about 100 damage was HIGH in D2
<Saturn> 08,01unless it's nsfw
<Saturn> 08,01(if it is, pm it to me)
<MadSurge> Is this hard mode or what?
<otakon> now I'm seeing 5 digit damage numbers and the enemies STILL aren't dying
<Jim> This is Hell difficulty I think
<otakon> MadSurge: I think it's Inferno
<MadSurge> otakon: equals the hardest difficulty?
<alexxm> Jim what are the difficulties and what would they translate into
<otakon> MadSurge: I think so
<Jim> You have Normal, then Nightmare, then Hell, then Inferno
<alexxm> thanks Jim
<Cypresswolf> took me much consideration to get the pre order through ebay, cause I prefer sites like J-list where they only accept your payment when they have the item in stock and prepped to send to you
<pyrocatboy> Saturn http://askdiscordwhooves.tumblr.com/
<MadSurge> Oh god, can't imagine what's the hardest difficulty like D:
<Jim> Which basicly translates to: Normal, hard, very hard and OH GOD WHY
<Alchemist> bronyfunds got 160$ since this morning. Thats not bad right?
<Cypresswolf> if they dont or can't get the item, your payment is left alone and nothing is sent
<alexxm> thanks Jim

<otakon> the hell?
<ACS13123> What just happened.... What?
<ACS13123> :p
<otakon> Jim: more like 90% clicking and 10% looting
<Lambo> Can you move with WASD in Diablo3 and Dota 2?
<Jim> Nope, you click to move
<Lambo> - why not?
<Lambo> I hate RPGs where I have to click to move
<Jim> Because that's how the game is made
<FairysHuff> Why do I have this sudden urge to listen to iron maiden? O_o
<Lambo> Literally prevents me from playing a game
<otakon> Lambo: yeah me too that's why I didn't like Diablo on the PC
<Malavolent> Reminds me of Sacred - the furious clicking.
<MadSurge> Is Diablo hard to defeat in tis game?
<RustyMeat> Hello bronystate

<Jim> Malavolent: In other words: "Sing us the song of your people"?
<otakon> pyrocatboy: makes sense, since Tara does the voice for the heroine
<Malavolent> Jim: You clever bastard, pretty much yes :D
<Jim> |Discord|: Yes, there's Hardcore mode, where you only have one life
<MadSurge> pyrocatboy: well, same voice actress :D
<Lambo> Please do never say YOLO again. YOLO is Carpe Diem, Memento Mori for dumb people

<Lambo> pyrocatboy: That is just wrong
<Lambo> Shit, I am afraid to play the last two chapters of Dead Space
<otakon> pyrocatboy: it's okay, but needs a decapitated Spike's head on her hip
<alexxm> how come Lambo
<otakon> Lambo: just do it
<Lambo> "Oh, you played so far? HERE! Have some invincible enemies"
<Lambo> Me: "Yeah, great idea."
<MadSurge> Lambo: nah, it's not a very scary game :D
<Lambo> I wish I could purchase Dead Space 2 in german Steam Store...
<otakon> Lambo: lol it's not THAT bad
<MadSurge> Also sawing off the invincible fucker's legs slows him sooo much :D
<alexxm> Lambo don't worry it's just jump scares
<Lambo> alexxm: Actually, I kinda figured out the way they implement those. I can easiyl predict them now
<Jim> So, now I have 2 copies of Amnesia, and I STILL haven't played it
*Elondras confused about this click click click click...goes to Bronystate...ah they streaming diablo :D hey everpony good evening :)

<FlaschenJoe11> GilDash: Fate!Gilgamesh is a guy with so much arrogance, Blueblood seems humble to him. He dies in every route of the game, 'cause he never takes his enemy seriously. And he is the only Character with a "Anti-World" type supermove.
<Floris> Does anyone have suggestions on some games to play? (f2p) I'm bored and don't like much, atm.. I know about tf2 and LoL.

<Alister> Traditional FPS conventions have it that dark rooms are bad
<CountDoofus> Then again, I'm almost never happy with anything I make.
