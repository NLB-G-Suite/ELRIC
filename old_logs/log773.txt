<Eli> Bronysith: why?
<RockWolf> add-ons are awesome
<Yahooz> >user named ya

<Bronysith> Eli: it is extremely overrated
<Yahooz> this is awkward
<Lil_B> Gregwil7 was going to, but I'm out of money so I'll wait a bit
<RockWolf> vampire sweetiebelle?
<Eli> Bronysith: it's still a good rpg, right?
<Bronysith> Eli: it just doesnt live up to the hype, but hey doesnt mean it is not enjoyable, have fun
<Invi> Lil_B, have you actually played Warlords Battlecry 3?
<Gregwil7> Well I'm in the EU so yeah...
*mew almost has a heart attack because of dogs barking
<Lil_B> Invi no
<Invi> aw
<Jageman> CrystalPhoenix: Gah so adorable
<Bronysith> Eli: eh, personally i think fallout is a better RPG series
<Anon_The_Sorcerer> mew is bad driver,apparentlly.
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: it is
<Eli> Bronysith: if i would go with the hype i would have bought it years ago.... i just like good rpgs
<Dark_Horst> btw, heck out this motherfucker of a salad http://www.wolff-catering.de/WebRoot/Store3/Shops/62168388/4A23/B9D4/7D54/81B6/E1E8/C0A8/28B8/335E/fleischsalat_m.jpg
<mew> oh you silly, i cant drive
<Canebridge> What's about to be drawn?
<Dark_Horst> and yes, that is pure sausage meat
<Bronysith> Eli: it is good, not fantastic, just good
<RockWolf> Gregwil7: what, is there a ban or something?
<Gregwil7> Different release date...
<RockWolf> ahh...
<Lil_B> Gregwil7 you may wanna look at the Zombi-U WiiU Bundle, comes with Zombi U and the Pro Controller and the Deluxe version, 399€ (would safe abou 30-50 € if you wanted to get Zombi U and the Controller anyway
<Bronysith> Eli: if you want fantastic, get fallout 1, 2 and 3, and new vegas
<Dark_Horst> german cuisine. leave it to us to make something completely devoid of vegetables and call it salad
<Sumica> 00,10lol "pure sauage"
<Gregwil7> What baffles me the most is that Japan get's it last
<Jageman> later all. Im going to go play skyrim
<Anon_The_Sorcerer> WAIT

<Bronysith> Eli: skyrim is FPS
<Anon_The_Sorcerer> FP SHOOTER?
<Bronysith> Eli: i mean, first person
<Anon_The_Sorcerer> Okay better
<Bronysith> can be shooter, if you use bows :D
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: we call it the fleischslat.
<Anon_The_Sorcerer> Argh
<Eli> Bronysith: it's the shooter part that really bugs me...
<Anon_The_Sorcerer> It has amazing physics too
<Bronysith> Eli: fallout is just an overall better series
<Anon_The_Sorcerer> Specially when you're on a Horse
<Sumica> 00,10bless you Dark_Horst
<Eli> Bronysith: opinions.
<Anon_The_Sorcerer> Horses are fucking Wizards.

<Justin> Dammit make the same mistake every time
<muffin_mix> i'm a pony
<Justin> So who's this guy supposed to be? Slendermane?
<muffin_mix> @justin, who?
<Justin> THe drawing
<MirrorImage> oh hey, wrek stream
*muffin_mix facehoofs and it makes a CLANG snound*
<Justin> Or am I looking at somethin different from everyone else?
<MirrorImage> no, i don't think you are
<Justin> Cause if I am my computers once again an asshole
<muffin_mix> what? snound? lol i mean sound
<Wrek> 05back
<Wrek> 05was gettign a bit chilly so i had to close the window
<Justin> So what is this drawing?

<Justin> Oh lemme guess you live in the Midwest like me? :)
<muffin_mix> ssssllllllooooooowwwwwwwww mmmmmmoooooootttttiiiiioooooonnnnnn
<Justin> Whats with the new video player?
<muffin_mix> are you guys still streaming? what is it now?
<MirrorImage> Justin - turns out Mips is vulnerable to streamjackings
<MirrorImage> so no more Mips
<Justin> Oh I see.
<Justin> Fucking /v/
<MirrorImage> don't think it was /v/
<muffin_mix> whats a /v/?
<Justin> I was told it was /v/
<Jmo> It wasn't /v/ for gods sake.
<String_Shredder> It was the GNAA. /v/ has nothing against bronies.
<Jmo> This has been explained multiple times.
<Justin> Sorry.
<Justin> didn't get teh memo
<muffin_mix> guys what's a /v/? or the GNAA?
<Justin> the GNAA are the assholes who hacked the stream yesterday
<muffin_mix> do they usually do that?
<Princess> *eats a muffin* *spits it out* WHUT?
<thelonepony|BL2> s
<aniderp> hijacked not hacked
<thelonepony|BL2> damn it
<String_Shredder> muffin_mix: one is a board on 4chan. The other you should google for yourself.
<Wrek> 05it wasnt /v/ and it wasnt a hack
<Wrek> 05it was a loophole in mips that caused it
<Princess> *REVERSES* oh. *eats muffin*
<Wrek> 05they didnt even have to hack anything
<Justin> @Wrek don't split hairs
*Wrek splits 100 hairs
<MirrorImage> Justin - the point is that a "hack" sounds so much worse than a "loophole"
*muffin_mix hops up and down for no discernable reason
<Justin> Touche
*Justin can't do the slash over the e
<DaringDerpy> When did it happen? I overslept the episode.
<Justin> Like between 9:00 and 9:30
<Wrek> 05no
<MirrorImage> DaringDerpy - they got it one during the opening scene, and did it again overnight at about 1AM EST
<Wrek> 05sayign it was a hack gives the responsible ones muuuuuch more credit that they deserve
<DaringDerpy> http://xkcd.com/932/
<muffin_mix> wrek, i think your text is red
<DaringDerpy> MirrorImage: ok, thx
<Wrek> 05nice observation
<Justin> Yeah. We should probably tell these uninitiated ones what the hijack image consisted of
<muffin_mix> GTG
<Alchemist> Wrek: Im surprised you haven't gone psycho yet for answering the same questions for over 24 hours now :D
<Justin> Wait I know...
<Justin> this is Deadpool!
<Justin> or the guy from Assassins Creed
<TrixieMuffin> Altair or Ezzio ?
<Justin> The guy you play as
<Justin> Never played Assassins Creed so I dont know.
<Alchemist> Justin: you play as both
<Justin> The dude with the cape

<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Mar doe well Twilight?
<Rex_Mundi> Dat Sumica OC
<DudeFromMinnesota> Why the gravy soaked fuck would Twilight be white?
<DaringDerpy> spidermare
<pinkieclone> i bet its derpy
<Princess> It looks like Rarity kinda.
<naturesfury> its twilight crossed with somthing. not gonna say what though quite yet
<Rex_Mundi> Mare do Well Rarity?
<DerpyMuffins> Rex_Mundi I see you finally found it
<Dark_Horst> you say that becasue white
<naturesfury> and no its not mare do well
<DaringDerpy> it has a white jihab
<muffin_mix> is this guy only gonna draw this?
<muffin_mix> not to be rude ^^
<DaringDerpy> probably a ninja
<naturesfury> o wait
<naturesfury> it might be rarity
<Rex_Mundi> Maybe a power ranger
<naturesfury> it makes more sense to do a rarity
<RustyMeat> ITS A PUMBLOOM
<naturesfury> im being dumb now so ill shut up
<DudeFromMinnesota> Cause Rarity is underappreciated.
<Rex_Mundi> Rarity is class
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Rarity needs love
<DudeFromMinnesota> No naturesfury you're not being dumb.
<DudeFromMinnesota> I'm listening
<DudeFromMinnesota> :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good morning everyone

<Dark_Horst> DudeFromMinnesota: who framed roger rabbit
<Dark_Horst> is a movie
<Rex_Mundi> Im in love with Rarity
<DaringDerpy> I like her greed ^^
<DudeFromMinnesota> Rarity is hotter than Jessica
<wipergone2> Rex_Mundi: just like spike
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rex_Mundi: I like her songs best ^-^
<Dark_Horst> what i like about rarity is that she'S so woidnerfully flawed
<DerpyMuffins> Fleur de Lis was better than Rarity
<wipergone2> wht is this shitty music
<DudeFromMinnesota> Rarity is sexiest pony
<DerpyMuffins> ^nope
<Dark_Horst> she's greedy but tries not to. and fails every so often :D
<Rex_Mundi> Rarity is hot indeed
*DoctoDoctorWho kicks DerpyMuffins
<killerpony7733> wipergone2 Complaining when wrek is streaming? tsk tsk that's not good for your health
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Sombra's Revenge / Apple Family Float / Art of the Match / Orange you Glad / You've Done it Twi

<Eli> would it be worth it to by Heartfire or Dawnguard with Skyrim?
<wipergone2> killerpony7733: wht helth
<DudeFromMinnesota> Complaining about the music? That's a paddlin'
<wipergone2> killerpony7733: health*
<YokusaHHart> Mexican death metal ftw!
<DaringDerpy> mexicans only make peruan flute music
<Dark_Horst> wipergone2: if it does not match your taste, you are invited to shut it and step out
<killerpony7733> ^
<DudeFromMinnesota> Disrespecting the guy who's streaming? That's another paddlin'
<Rex_Mundi> Sombrero likes mexican metal
<DaringDerpy> never heard it, YokusaHHart
<DoctoDoctorWho> DerpyMuffins: For pony biology that would be correct but as far as the slang for the word has evolved it would be really awkward.
<DerpyMuffins> Indeed
<DerpyMuffins> Rarity isn't sexist pony
<DerpyMuffins> Maybe best whore
<DoctoDoctorWho> And ponies can still kick I think
<DerpyMuffins> But that's about it
<DudeFromMinnesota> She's only a whore in the fanfics
<DaringDerpy> stahp dahpi!
<DoctoDoctorWho> I will eat you.
<DudeFromMinnesota> You should read Like Fine Wine
<DudeFromMinnesota> Everyone
<DudeFromMinnesota> every Rarity fan
<DoctoDoctorWho> Insultin mah ponies, tsk tsk
<Rex_Mundi> Rarity is sexy pone
<DerpyMuffins> I get a homosexuality vibe from Rarity
<DudeFromMinnesota> awwww shit son /me takes out lighter
*DudeFromMinnesota takes out lighter
<Dark_Horst> wat
<DoctoDoctorWho> DerpyMuffins: Oh now ya fucked up!
<DerpyMuffins> Let's face it, Rarity is more into mares than RD is
<DaringDerpy> wisdom of the day: raubtier is german for predator
<Rex_Mundi> This ould be Celestia...
<DaringDerpy> still don't understand anything
<Rex_Mundi> *coud
<DudeFromMinnesota> What was Fancypants doing in Ponyville? Rarity.
<Dark_Horst> DerpyMuffins: and you draw that conclusion hoooow exactly?
<DoctoDoctorWho> DerpyMuffins: wait, I see what your doing...
<pinkieclone> ah
<DoctoDoctorWho> she be trollin
<Wrek> 05how can you call this shitty?
<DerpyMuffins> What am I doing exactly DoctoDoctorWho
<Dark_Horst> of course
<Dark_Horst> but even trolling needs grounds
<DudeFromMinnesota> Who said it was shitty?
<DerpyMuffins> Who said this was shitty?
<DoctoDoctorWho> ^
<Wrek> 05wipergone2
<naturesfury> ya who called this shitty?
<DerpyMuffins> Get him!
<Dark_Horst> my guess? bieber fan
<DoctoDoctorWho> wipergone2: :|
<Rex_Mundi> DudeFromMinnesota: I dislike the Fancypants/Rarity ship (Rarepants?), I think he is too old for Rarity and is too minor a character. I friendship those two.
<DudeFromMinnesota> mmkay.
<wipergone2> Dark_Horst: u calling me bieber fan?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ya they are best rich friends, :P
<Dark_Horst> Rex_Mundi: sides, he'S already getting golddigged by fleur
<Dark_Horst> wipergone2: i did
<DoctoDoctorWho> Fleur = Trophy wife
<Rex_Mundi> Dark_Horst: yeah... also, Fleur is nice
<DerpyMuffins> If you guys haven't notice, mares outnumber stallions in Equestria
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<wipergone2> Dark_Horst: fail troll is fail
<DudeFromMinnesota> Fleur = One dimensional dumbass.
<DaringDerpy> fleur is expendable
<DudeFromMinnesota> Wait...are these guys German or Scandinavian?
<Dark_Horst> wipergone2: troll? you came in and complained about the music. thatw as a conclusion
<DoctoDoctorWho> The population is like, 80% female
<DerpyMuffins> Fleur is a harlot, nothing more
<Dark_Horst> wipergone2: also, i dont think you know what a troll is
<DaringDerpy> DoctoDoctorWho: and mostly nude
<naturesfury> DaringDerpy: -.(\
<wipergone2> Dark_Horst: i do
<Rex_Mundi> Daring DoctoDoctorWho /)
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> I like Fleur
<DaringDerpy> naturesfury: hm?
<Dark_Horst> DoctoDoctorWho: remmember season one? clestia'S lust dungeon was a widepsread theory back then
<DudeFromMinnesota> Are these guys German or Scandinavian? I'm so confused.
<DaringDerpy> swedish
<Rex_Mundi> Incans
<DerpyMuffins> Wrek is swedish
<DudeFromMinnesota> I'm like the only Non-Scandinavian in my state.
<DudeFromMinnesota> Oh so as a Swede he probably wouldn't have gotten my Simpsons reference then?
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> I'm Scandinavian too
<DoctoDoctorWho> DaringDerpy: The interesting thing about equestria is that I view it as what the world may be like if and sorry for the religion ref here, eve never bit off the tree. They make clothes for purpose and for occasion, but otherwise dont have problems with nudity.
<Dark_Horst> DudeFromMinnesota: i'm pretty sure that show is everywhere
<Rex_Mundi> She needs a long tail. I rather like long tails.
<DerpyMuffins> I bet you do
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> I really liker her tail
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> like
<DaringDerpy> DoctoDoctorWho: they have winter fur. humans don't.
<DudeFromMinnesota> I really like her ho-OH GOD THERES BLOOD EVERYWHERE!
<Dark_Horst> and that is why fluttershy
<Socks> Sup dudes, what we watching?
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Fluttertree
<Dark_Horst> Socks: wrek be drawing
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Socks
<aniderp> a unicorn
<DudeFromMinnesota> HELP ME!
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> OC pony-unicorn-mare do well
<Dark_Horst> DudeFromMinnesota: try cleenex
<DudeFromMinnesota> I CAN SEE MY SMALL INTESTINE!
<Rex_Mundi> Diamond_Tiara_2012: It might be rarity
<Rex_Mundi> Hell, it could possible be Celestia.
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> anything I can do to hekp?
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> help
<DerpyMuffins> Wow, I just brought 6 games on steam
<DudeFromMinnesota> CALL 911!
<DoctoDoctorWho> DaringDerpy: The ponies in show dont grow winter coats, and its just like with human society. If there is no nudity taboo, we will make clothes for a purpose.
<DoctoDoctorWho> nothing more
<Rex_Mundi> Edible boots
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> we normally dont wear clothes
<DaringDerpy> DoctoDoctorWho: status symbols
<DaringDerpy> milieu symbols
<DerpyMuffins> Nudity isn't taboo in Equestria
<Rex_Mundi> Because clothes are pretty, duh
<DudeFromMinnesota> At first when Sweetie Belle said that I thought she said "edible boobs"
<DerpyMuffins> Things got awkward
<Dark_Horst> that sounds very disturbing
<DoctoDoctorWho> DaringDerpy: there are many different reasons, but the need to be clothed at all times is null and void.
<Socks> Clothes are a luxury in Equestria
<DerpyMuffins> Only rich ponies wear clothes
<Socks> ^
<DudeFromMinnesota> Edible boobs
<DaringDerpy> DoctoDoctorWho: it solves a few problems society still hasn't worked out otherwise. the whole sexual stuff
<DerpyMuffins> It's teats
<DudeFromMinnesota> I would like some milk from the milkmans wifes tits
<Socks> All boobs are edible, it's just that few people like canabalism
<DerpyMuffins> Ponies don't have 'boobs'
<DoctoDoctorWho> DaringDerpy: Exactly! Im beggining to think we are both on the same side of the arguement here,
<DudeFromMinnesota> I would like some milk from the milkmans wifes tits
<Wrek> 05oo this is a good song
<Ditzy> Hi :P
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Ditzy
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> hi
*Socks hugs Ditzy
<DaringDerpy> DoctoDoctorWho: probably
<Dark_Horst> i think i know that one
<DudeFromMinnesota> I would like some milk from the milkmans wifes tits
<Dark_Horst> oh and i notice he now has songtitles on display
<Dark_Horst> sweet
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<Ditzy> Where Muffins
<Rex_Mundi> Actually, its only ponyville that is nude all the time, all the ponies in other towns all wear clothes
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> I want burnt juice
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rex_Mundi: cloudsdale
<Dark_Horst> Rex_Mundi: not really
<DudeFromMinnesota> Brains
<DudeFromMinnesota> pony brains
<Dark_Horst> there'S quite a bunch of unclothed ponies in canterlot
<Socks> Rex_Mundi: Generally just hats
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rex_Mundi: that western town
<DudeFromMinnesota> ZomBEEZ
<Dark_Horst> and almost no crystal pony had clothing
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Grape juice
<Rex_Mundi> right
<Dark_Horst> dunno about manehatten, i think that was an equal spread
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rex_Mundi: Oh yeah, AAAAAAAAPLEOOSA!
<Dark_Horst> makes sense, it being a metropolis and all
<DaringDerpy> now that I think about it, Fleur was the only female canterlot citizen without hat. how naughty!
<DudeFromMinnesota> Crystal ponies aren't actually made of crystal are they?
<DoctoDoctorWho> no :|
<Dark_Horst> DudeFromMinnesota: they are if you ask the crystal heart
<Socks> It makes sense only the rich having clothes, have you ever seen a second hand clothes shop in equestria?
<DudeFromMinnesota> FUN
<Ditzy> MUFFIN WHERE MUFFIN :(
<DudeFromMinnesota> FUN
<Rex_Mundi> DudeFromMinnesota: Nay, its only a magic effect that makes them sparkly that wears off.
<DudeFromMinnesota> FUN FUN FUN FUN
<DudeFromMinnesota> FUN
<DaringDerpy> there is no poverty in equestria. probably an oil sheikdom
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> I like muffin
<DoctoDoctorWho> DaringDerpy: haha, oh theres poverty alright.
<DudeFromMinnesota> No Celestia just kills all the homeless
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Derpy_Hooves
<Socks> DudeFromMinnesota: :D
<Dark_Horst> Rex_Mundi: it wears off after they leave the empire boundaries
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> hi
<DerpyMuffins> I swear there is like 6 derpys here
<DaringDerpy> turns them into stone
<Dark_Horst> we never get to know if it doesnt stay intac in the crystal city
<Socks> All the derp :P
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Tom
<DudeFromMinnesota> Sorry.
<DudeFromMinnesota> what is sorry in Swedish?
<Rex_Mundi> I find the 'Clip clop' sound the ponies hooves make to be super adorable.
<DaringDerpy> resistance is futile. you will be derpified
<DudeFromMinnesota> I WANT A FLUGELHORN!
<DudeFromMinnesota> like that?
<Socks> The DerpBorg, I smell fanfic!
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> I want cake
*Socks scribbles
<Dark_Horst> DudeFromMinnesota: then she stuffs their bodies into her tlailaxu meat tank and forms new pretty mares out of the raw material
<Jmo> Demaa
<Rex_Mundi> *steals socks*
<DerpyMuffins> I find pony squees to be overrated
<DoctoDoctorWho> Its kind of their shtick to be crystally, so I assume it doesnt wear off unless the crystal heart is compromised, wherever they are
<Dark_Horst> at least that'S my theory about the high mare to stallion ratio
<DudeFromMinnesota> Veggie salad
*DaringDerpy squees like a little girl when ponies do something cute :3
<Dark_Horst> *fleischsalat
<DudeFromMinnesota> ....
<DudeFromMinnesota> meat salad?
<DudeFromMinnesota> Really?
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> squee
<Rex_Mundi> Maybe its like G1, the boy ponies are off on a race around the worlds
<Socks> The squees are like the wilhelm scream, overated and overused, but I love it anyway :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dark_Horst: Or you know, they just have a high female birth rate, that too
<DudeFromMinnesota> Or half of the mares are actually drag queens.
<Dark_Horst> DoctoDoctorWho: with celestia? nope
<naturesfury> actually guys
<Dark_Horst> DudeFromMinnesota: really
<DudeFromMinnesota> Like Bon Bon and Lyra
<DudeFromMinnesota> actually drag queens
<DaringDerpy> DaringDerpy + ponies http://i.imgur.com/nnHjE.jpg
<Rex_Mundi> actually drag Changlings
<Zamer> and I'm back Bronystate from working on a test :D
<naturesfury> all the males are in the military. must be a young agg draft in equestria
<naturesfury> age*
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Lyra are human in Equyestria
<Dark_Horst> DudeFromMinnesota: it'S a real thing http://www.food-shop24.com/images/Nadler%20Delikatess%20Fleischsalat%20mit%20Salatcreme%20200g.jpg?osCsid=1b0cc52d89a0e5c5dce106927df3b63f
<DaringDerpy> with at least 5% meat
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> om no mnom
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> om nom nom
<DudeFromMinnesota> Lyra and Bon Bon are drag queens.
<naturesfury> man these songs are loooooooong
<DoctoDoctorWho> naturesfury: most are in the military, maybe its a draft.
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Hier öffnen!
<Socks> How is it possible to be a drag queen with no clothes 6.9
<Rex_Mundi> There were soooo many Lyras and Bonbons in the crowd last episode
<alexxm> how'd the test go Zamer
<DoctoDoctorWho> naturesfury: you serve your time, then your out. Unless your talent is the gaurd
<DudeFromMinnesota> I would like some milk from the milkmans wifes tits
<Zamer> dunno we had thanksgiving week to work on it
<Rex_Mundi> Maybe, Castrated males? :O
<Zamer> probably won't be graded till wensday
<naturesfury> did wrek stop drawing?
<Dark_Horst> Rex_Mundi: those are called geldings
<DudeFromMinnesota> Everyone sing with me
<DudeFromMinnesota> I would like some milk from the milkmans wfies tits
<DudeFromMinnesota> wifes*
<DoctoDoctorWho> I honestly think the Equestrian gaurd is just a formality, and they have a real functional military in reserve
<DaringDerpy> dinner time in europe
<Dark_Horst> i actually dont know that song
<DaringDerpy> DoctoDoctorWho: I want to see their battle mages
<DudeFromMinnesota> Milkman by Aphex Twin
<Dark_Horst> seeing how ponies know trenches, camouflasge and tanks, that is a valid theory
<Socks> Tanks? WHen did this happen?
<DaringDerpy> they have machine guns
<naturesfury> when did they have a tank?
<DoctoDoctorWho> And bullets
<Zamer> is Wrek drawing Slenderpony?
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353836450505.png have some feels
<DaringDerpy> they talked about tanks twice
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Tank the turtle?
<Dark_Horst> Socks: mentioned in rarities song art of the dress. also, RDs pet tortoise is named tank
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ahem, "He'll need to go fast as a bullet to keep up with me!"
<DaringDerpy> Bronysith: :(
<NullRadix> Emergency Edible Boots. Discuss
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Bronysith: Oh. Them feels.
<Socks> They mention the word tank, not acctual tanks
<Gasoline> What is he drawing?
<naturesfury> Gasoline: we arnt compleatly sure yet
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> A white horse?
<Gasoline> Okay
<naturesfury> NO WAY :O
<Dark_Horst> Socks: well, she was careful to design a dress that wouldn make rainbows flank look like a tank
<Socks> NullRadix: You mean you don't have those, what happens if your out walking and you get hungry?
<DaringDerpy> seems to be a horse
<Dark_Horst> i'm pretty sure they were talking about the war machines
<DaringDerpy> maybe a goat
<Zamer> I has money on SlenderPony
<DaringDerpy> not sure yet
<Rex_Mundi> My little gelding, castration is magic
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> horse pun
<DoctoDoctorWho> Nothing else would make sense in context
<naturesfury> o ya
<Socks> Dark_Horst: But the word tank could mean somthing different in equestr... hell what am I doing, ponies driving tanks would be awesome :D. This is now canon!
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353860020315.png
<naturesfury> what are the shows for next week any1 know?
<DaringDerpy> dafuq?
<Socks> Canon, Tank :P
<DerpyMuffins> How long you been on 4chan Bronysith
<Rex_Mundi> If AJ has a pickup truck, than Equestria can have tanks
<DaringDerpy> I'd like to know it too. Who won the lottery?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rex_Mundi: where?

<Socks> DaringDerpy: Probably half the regulars on BS :D
<Dark_Horst> but it would need targeting spells and precision optics
<DaringDerpy> haha
<Dark_Horst> maybe an earthpon unicorn joint project=
<DaringDerpy> what for?

<Bronysith> DISCUSSION TIME, what you guys think of that PoS "Dusks Dawn"
<Socks> Just checking rules, Stream is on, but on intermission do normal "stream on" rules apply?
<cachi01> http://media.moddb.com/images/downloads/1/21/20567/tank.jpg
<Dark_Horst> well, PzKwIII, but who cares
<cachi01> Bronysith: its bad....
<Socks> As in posting?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dark_Horst: Its similar, but no
<DaringDerpy> Socks: rules don't apply when you get away with breaking them
<Socks> :D
<Dark_Horst> DoctoDoctorWho: prototype. there were several iterations of that model
<Dark_Horst> DoctoDoctorWho: give me a top screenshot and i find you the right one
<DaringDerpy> :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dark_Horst: Its model was never specified, but this is an altrenate history pic, so panzers dont exist
<Socks> This is why I love nerds, you find out people are obsessed with the most wonderful things :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Note, tanks are larger than they appear
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100324204640/fma/images/b/be/BriggsTank.JPG
<Dark_Horst> DoctoDoctorWho: this one seems to do
<Dark_Horst> DoctoDoctorWho: also, if remember correctly, the whole bunch had a distinct german vibe to it. alone from the names
<DoctoDoctorWho> DaringDerpy: Amestris was distinctly resemblent of the third reich, but better and cooler.
<DaringDerpy> the uniform in the pic looks like an ss coat
<DaringDerpy> DaringDerpy: might be worth a look
<DaringDerpy> DoctoDoctorWho:
<DaringDerpy> so
<DaringDerpy> tab fail
<DaringDerpy> silence

<DaringDerpy> French
<Serenity> SpeccyRush: I get on with Wrek. For now.

<DaringDerpy> legit like the free candy van
<DoctoDoctorWho> didnt think so
<Jmo> THE FREE CANDY VAN IS REAL.

<Serenity> Dinkleberg is the blame for everything
<DaringDerpy> "St-Pierre and Miquelon is not a part of the EU customs territory. The EU has a customs agreement with the PTOMA overseas territories, of which St-Pierre and Miquelon are part. The regulations and duties applied in St-Pierre and Miquelon are not the same as those applied in the EU. For one thing, there is no VAT."
<DaringDerpy> ptoma?
<DaringDerpy> meh
<Serenity> Actually, the reason for this whole problem is fried chicken bitch watermelon

<Rex_Mundi> Juess what i learned? In a G1 tie-in comic book, the origins of he baby ponies are explained. There were created by a pony looking into a magic mirror that creates a baby version of the pony. So that explains why there is a character called "lickity Split" and a seperate character named "baby lickity split" who looks exactly like Lickity split, but a baby.

<Socks> Ok... Enflish I'm cool with this...
<Eddmario> Apparently the side rooms are open, even though they're not supposed to be.
<CriticKitten> And then magically Japanese?
<Vordox> Eddmario: They are not
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: :D
<Wrek> 05didnt remember that its beign silly having eng audio as nr 1
<GilDash> MadSurge: Nah, looks like newbies.
<Socks> Oh, apparently dubs arent good enough!
<MadSurge> GilDash: thought so
<Vordox> Socks: Very few are
<CriticKitten> So you can make your subs into dubs and back again? Wrek is a sorcerer. o.o
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> But I dont like to read!
<Zawan> silly english
<Vordox> <--- Mangrove Heaven, eh
<GilDash> MadSurge: Bringing their 4chan ways here. Tsk, tsk...
<Eddmario> Vordox: Well they are for me.
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: if the english dub is passable, why dont we just use that one`? easier to follow chat
<Vordox> Eddmario: No they are not, you can't join them :P
<Socks> Vordox: But then a lot of them are just as good, depends on anime really.
<DinkyDoo> Splash.

<GilDash> MadSurge: I can be... depending on what I think I can get away with. ;)
<Vordox> Eddmario: Using a special Irc?
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge and GilDash: :D
<CriticKitten> I like her a lot already. No whiny boy-teen drama while she's around. Now we need to strategically place characters like her into every Final Fantasy game....
<Eddmario> Vordox: Not that I know of..
<Rose`> a special IRC
<scout19_tf2> alexxm: ive been good:$ just bought another mlp shirt
<Rose`> or a "special SCP?"
<AJIsAwesome> scout19_tf2: Nice! :)
<Vordox> Rose`: Which SCP?
<Eddmario> So, I heard you guys got hacked yesterday...
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: GilDash and I met at BUCK :3c
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Nice. :O
<Vordox> Eddmario: So you're the one?
<Wrek> 05801-J
<Dark_Horst> did that board cannon use a battlefield firing sound?
<Vordox> :P
<Dark_Horst> i know i hearrd that before
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> La Style~ :D
<BaconMane> 0,5J-108
<GilDash> AJIsAwesome: Yes, you should try and come this year if you can.
<Eddmario> Vordox: No, just seeing if a rumor is true or not
<DoctoDoctorWho> Eddmario: The day before actually, no biggie.
<cachi01> Eddmario: you tell me http://imgur.com/M20Ff
<Vordox> Eddmario: They did get hacked on Friday by GNAA
<Rose`> The Bronystate PR department does not sustain any rumors of a hack, thank you for your concern
<AJIsAwesome> GilDash: It depends. I'll try my hardest to.
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: GilDash dons awesome hawaiian shirts!
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: :D
<CriticKitten> "hack"
<scout19_tf2> how have u been alexxm
<Socks> cachi01: O_o
<Dark_Horst> according to the mods it wasnt a hack
<CriticKitten> hafta?
<Wrek> 05there was no hack
<Dark_Horst> some dipshit simply god his hands on the streaming key
<cachi01> hijack
<alexxm> i'm good scout19_tf2
<Wrek> 05jsut a simple hijack due to mips not hiding its stream keys
<GilDash> AJIsAwesome, MadSurge: Yes, I am the one in the hawaiian shirt. I shall try again this year. ^_^
<DoctoDoctorWho> The mods are just trying to deny it
<Rose`> The PR department has spoken, There was no 'hack'
<GilDash> Bronystate wasn't hacked. Only the stream was.
<LadyCanary> ... =__=
<Wrek> 05this "hijack" has happened many times before we use it when we switch streamers
<cachi01> hack nope. just hijacked
<CriticKitten> People don't understand what "hack" means. >_>
<Wrek> 05not even the stream was hacked
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: im guessing that'S why i havent seen mips in the window since then?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Either way, we were invaded
<MadSurge> GilDash: I'll try to be there again :)
<Wrek> 05yes
<GilDash> Well, it's hardly a hack.
<Eddmario> So, did one of the mods forget to close one of the side rooms?
<AJIsAwesome> Hijacked, my friends. Not hacked.
<Wrek> 05calling it a hack gives the guys behind it waaaay too much credit
<MadSurge> ^
<DinkyDoo> What does Hijacked mean?
<Socks> But hack sounds more epic :/
<Gasoline> It does
<thelonepony> DinkyDoo: ttaking over
<DinkyDoo> Socks: True dat.
<CriticKitten> And it wasn't all that epic, ergo they don't merit the credit
<Rose`> saying that was a hack was like saying youre hacking someones facebook account if they leave it open
<thelonepony> taking*
<cachi01> DinkyDoo: lets say you are driving a boat and then i suddenly take it from you and i use it
<MadSurge> Socks: but it wasn't epic:D
<GilDash> What Rose` said.
<Dark_Horst> nice poster
<DoctoDoctorWho> DinkyDoo: taken controll of
<Gasoline> Rose`: lol
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Crissy and Sarah aaah yeah :D
<alexxm> can we get a clearer view of the pin up poster
<CriticKitten> Oh, and by the way some boobs in the background, just to remind you this is an anime.
<AJIsAwesome> DinkyDoo: I would say hijack is taking control, and hacking a complete override with no solution to the problem.
<DinkyDoo> Punch.
<AJIsAwesome> *taking control for a set time period
<Socks> SOmetimes it's nice to laugh at the iggnorant trolls :D
<DinkyDoo> Oh..
<DoctoDoctorWho> DinkyDoo: If I hijacked a vehicle, I killed/incapacitated everyone on it and took controll
<Socks> *ignorant FTW :D
<AdamTheDuck> DoctoDoctorWho, you don't have to kill them to hijack the vehicle
<Wrek> 05they didnt even do that
<Wrek> 05its like this
<Wrek> 05im driving
<Vordox> <---- Rock is one of my favourites due to a reason you'l see soon
<Wrek> 05adn they tried to grab the steering wheel
<DoctoDoctorWho> AdamTheDuck: I said or incapacitate
<Wrek> 05and we pucnhed them
<Wrek> 05and continued driving
<Gasoline> Like in GTA?
<CriticKitten> ^
<Socks> Hacking requires skill
<cachi01> Gasoline: yep
<GilDash> Wrek: Don't you try grab my steering wheel. It won't end well. XD

*HoodyNinja stabs Rose` repeatedly
<Bronysith> Rose`: ahh, so you're that bitch that my cousin smacked during batman
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: is that your personal kill score?
<Meulin> fuck all of you and your crappy streaming and even crappier modding. No wonder this website doesn't have more popularity, the only good thing about it is the Saturday streams. Other than that, this place is nothing but a cesspool of whiny and annoying idiots. Bye.

<thelonepony> :O
<AJIsAwesome> This is CRAZY........
<scout19_tf2> yeah
<TrixieMuffin> better than the other way round
<KrazyNoobs> Anime is awesome because it is easily made, highly entertaining, and it goes forever. Pokemon is at over 700 episodes now, i think.
<Vordox> KrazyNoobs: Easily made
<Vordox> ROFL
<AdamTheDuck> KrazyNoobs, uhh, I hate those animes that last forever
<KrazyNoobs> 80 episodes per year with Pokemon? Has to have been easily made.
<Wrek> 05>easely made
<Wrek> 05>red lien took 7 years to make
<Wrek> 05riiiight
<Vordox> Wrek: I already laughed at him. :P
<KrazyNoobs> They start out good, but they get crappy. Like Pokemon! I love Pokemon when it is old, but new Pokemon sucks.
<scout19_tf2> all it wud take is one bullet, ONE BULLET:[
<animebrony> She can shoot while driving
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :) back
<thelonepony> Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back, Sketch_Toku_Brony. :)
<Cypresswolf> Roberta > Terminator
<KrazyNoobs> Some animes with huge amounts of special effects, such as this one, would be hard. As stated by me before, Pokemon is easily made. 80 episodes per year, which does diminish its quality.
*HoodyNinja glomps Sketch_Toku_Brony
<scout19_tf2> heller Sketch_Toku_Brony:)
<Vordox> HERE IT IS

*animebrony glomps HoodyNinja
<LadyCanary> Those weapons. WANT PLS
<Dark_Horst> they totally did not just reference terminator
<HoodyNinja> Ow ;~;
<HoodyNinja> Why you glomp me
<AssertiveFluttershy1> hmmmmmmm
<Tyr> they'Vebeen referencing it all episide
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Sketch_Toku_Brony
<animebrony> Cus I like you.
<animebrony> Its me Justin lawl
<Wrek> 05this is jsut gettign goood
<scout19_tf2> ONE BULLET:[ :[ :[
<Cypresswolf> Roberta is Best maid
<LadyCanary> IKR
<Vordox> scout19_tf2: This isn't TF2
<Tyr> she goes abosultely BONKERS in the secodn season
<KrazyNoobs> The less episode per year, the more time to work on an episode, and the better quality it will be, as demonstrated by Season 3 Episode 3 of MLP:FiM. Ep 1, 2 sucked, and 4 didn't meet my expectations. Season 3 has 9 episodes to redeem itself.
<Vordox> KrazyNoobs: LAWL
<LadyCanary> ....
<scout19_tf2> Vordox: :P wut
<Vordox> KrazyNoobs: Boy, go back and read up on anime from the beginning. please
*LadyCanary facedesks.
<KrazyNoobs> I was talking about ponies. I moved on from anime.
<LadyCanary> dUDE.

<Rose`> CCCP, would you like to re-read what you just wrote?
<Rose`> i'll give you a few minutes.

<Cypresswolf> I need to find my Tank Police series - havent watched that in ages
<Tyr> aaaand this chat is going in an awkward direction
<CCCP> Rose otakon it has been almost disproven that that is not true.
<Vordox> otakon: Not to be WITh it, but if it's safe sex? =P
<Yahooz> CCCP: back up your points
<Yahooz> SHOW US THE STATS
<Rose`> CCCP, have you SEEN some of the people on the british isles?
<otakon> CCCP: bullcrap, that's why "pure" breed dogs have so many health issues

<pinkiebrony> but they get sued anyway
<Jmo> You're a genius Phase.
<DeathStar> DarkColt: yesh...
<pinkiebrony> they werent allowed
<DarkColt> Hasbro's stock is rising actually; it's funny, for my Economics class I'm using Hasbro as my main stock for my project
<pinkiebrony> but they get sued anyway
<pinkiebrony> they werent allowed
<DarkColt> I chose it due to season 3 coming out xD
<[SWAG]Haku> hmm?
<DarkColt> All the selling of merchandise for the holiday season! :D
<Kinixys> Hmm.. maybe should buy some hasbro stock.
<DarkColt> Wouldn't be a bad idea; though it may just be temp
<DarkColt> If you're looking to buy, wait till after season 3, and between season 3 and 4, buy the stock

<SpadeMagnes[R> You know what this game needs?
<SpadeMagnes[R> Needs more sand
<twilight_sprinkle> depends on your definition of hug i guess
<Deacon> DarkColt magic, ooh!, with whimsey!

<Deacon> meeshluvderpy you mean when ponies are streamed? well it's mostly on special occasions here, like new episodes
<SpadeMagnes[R> Dwarf Fortress, where losing is fun!

<SpadeMagnes[R> Is it wrong for me to find this game kinda boring?
<Allegr0> GabeMoist: trust me...with the internet connection my university's been shitting out...the buffer's been my friend a lot lately
<Stallion_of_War> It'd probably be more intersting if you knew, anything, about it...
<SpadeMagnes[R> From my standpoint right now, it doesnt look that interesting
*Stallion_of_War I'ma use my power of cuttin' things in half, with my axe.
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 Allegr0's OC is has a buffer ring for a cutie mark
<Zamordomin> Just downloaded the rar. It's a free game. It has a howtoplay text file attached
*Stallion_of_War and summon funnel cakes
<AdamTheDuck> has*
<Allegr0> AdamTheDuck: oh god no...
<AdamTheDuck> :$
<Allegr0> in tech news though, I did buy a new mobo during black friday :D
<GabeMoist> Allegr0, certainly your university's internet isn't worse than my university's internet
<Stallion_of_War> AdamTheDuck: But is it animated?
<Triple_Aught> I...have absolouty no idea how this is played
<Triple_Aught> I thought MTG was bad
<Stallion_of_War> I wish A Game of Thrones was on Netflix streaming...
<DeathStar> Triple_Aught: it's easy to roll the thingies and flip cards and move them about a bit
<Stallion_of_War> The first one to give Shizuka all their stuff wins?
<DeathStar> Triple_Aught: the winner is the one who lookes like they know what they're doing
<Triple_Aught> Heck, it's been years since i've seen D&D played on a board
<Triple_Aught> this is a whole new element
*AdamTheDuck licks otakon
<otakon> stop that
<AdamTheDuck> Nu :3
<GabeMoist> Ohai otakon
*AdamTheDuck continues to lick otakon
<otakon> ....
*DeathStar nokato skcil
<otakon> how can a duck even lick?
<otakon> and suddenly a space station too
<otakon> y'all are weird :P
<Triple_Aught> AFLAC
<Stallion_of_War> I need to find a game of something, if just for the fact that I can play the "Fallen fate" character idea I have.
<GabeMoist> space ducks?
<AdamTheDuck> Apparently ducks have tongues too.
<Stallion_of_War> FFS I WANT A SCYTHE
<Stallion_of_War> Ducks can sing good opera
<GabeMoist> QUACK
<DeathStar> moo!
*Stallion_of_War doesn't see any D20s
<Stallion_of_War> Nopony else knows of Critical Hit/Major Spoilers podcast?
<Triple_Aught> Isn't it kinda redundant to play a board game on a computer? I mean, I thought the whole idea of an RPG is to enhance the reality instead of...well...this.
<Stallion_of_War> Reality for those who don't exist in the same relative demension in time/space
<AdamTheDuck> Moo, I'm a horse :3
*Stallion_of_War is war
<DeathStar> moo moomoo mooooo moo AdamTheDuck
<DeathStar> I'm a space station ^_^
<otakon> Triple_Aught: it's called retro...
<otakon> DeathStar: that dances
<DeathStar> otakon: eeyup :3

<Triple_Aught> You want old? I remember playing Car Wars (Pre Gurps) when molds were used to make 3D vehilces for the map
<Shizuka> 13hit the exit in corner?
<Phase4> 00,02maybe
<DeathStar> Triple_Aught: I have no idea what you're talking about :D
*Stallion_of_War suddenly a wild Phase4 appears
*AdamTheDuck throws a pokeball at Phase4
<Stallion_of_War> I need a 7-hour long nap
<DeathStar> guys! you need to weaken the pokemon first then throw a pokeball! Phase4 is a strong pokemon
*AdamTheDuck throws a rock at Phase4 then
<Triple_Aught> DeathStar: GO back twenty years
<Stallion_of_War> There's a lot of British people in star wars yes? Jedi Master Tennant and Master Cumberbatch?
<DeathStar> Triple_Aught: okeys ^_^ at least I won't have to worry about running into my past self
*Jmo slaps DeathStar around a bit with a large trout
<Stallion_of_War> I find it funny how David Tennant is doing the voice for the lightsaber construction driod
<Triple_Aught> DeathStar: Not to worry. I was ony 10 or so back then
*DeathStar slaps Jmo around with a small whale
<Jmo> Whaaaaaaaaale
<DeathStar> Triple_Aught: I was not born....
<Triple_Aught> DeathStar: Ouch
<Stallion_of_War> given Sonic Screwdriver:Docor = Lightsaber:Jedi
<Stallion_of_War> *Doctor
<DeathStar> Stallion_of_War: the sonic Screwdriver is not a weapon though
<Triple_Aught> DeathStar: This will help explain things: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_Wars
<Stallion_of_War> It's very good at opening doors
<Stallion_of_War> though
<DeathStar> Triple_Aught: I apologise. it's my job to make people eather feel old or feel tall... though the tall part only works irl :3
*Stallion_of_War is roughly 6'
*Stallion_of_War and 21
<DeathStar> I'm 5,1... I think... I dunno.. darn not metric units
<Stallion_of_War> DO YOUR JOB NOW :[
<DeathStar> and 18 \:D/
<NocturnalBlade> i think i'm about 5'4" 5'5" ^_^
<Stallion_of_War> DeathStar: Google is your brain; metric -> imperial
<Stallion_of_War> x cm in inches
<Stallion_of_War> then /12
<Triple_Aught> DeathStar: No worries. I like to dance between the late x Gen and early Y gen : )
<Mutterguy> It's about 30 cm a foot
<DeathStar> Stallion_of_War: but I can't remember my metric size... because I only remember my imperial size from someone converting it for me...
<Stallion_of_War> lol Imperial size...
<Vordox> <--- lawl, someone raging?

<Stallion_of_War> Or we could roll a dice
<TeaDrinker> Yeah Shizuka is awesome.
<TeaDrinker> Brohoof for Shizuka
<Stallion_of_War> 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12 for the four players

<AmericanTeaDrinker> I might respect the show more now...just...get rid of Meg and Stewie and make Peter actually funny.
<AmericanTeaDrinker> I mean its not terrible. It's gotten a little better.
<AmericanTeaDrinker> That episode where Meg is kidnapped had me laughing my ass off.
<AmericanTeaDrinker> But thats just my opinion.
<Triple_Aught> I still want to see Ed O'neal from Married w/Children and Peter go at it in a fistfight
<AmericanTeaDrinker> These marbles look like olives <------------
<Jmo> Sometimes opinions are better to be kept to yourself.
<AmericanTeaDrinker> What's your problem?
<Jmo> I have no problem.
*SpeccyRush pulls up a chair
*AmericanTeaDrinker belches
<otakon> AmericanTeaDrinker: he's Austrailian

<Venus> 08,01indian music.

<Venus> 08,01oh god, i need to pee

<Shizuka> 13moderately distasteful joke when discussing indians to ask "dots or feathers"
<Shizuka> 13meaning india indians or native american indians
<The_Doctor> Eh?
<Venus> 08,01oh
<Shizuka> 13dot or feather
<Venus> 08,01we don't call native americans indians here
<Mutterguy> NZ still uses the eskimos and Canada hates us for it :D

<Mutterguy> *term
<DeathStar> Mutterguy: no we don't only for the eskimo pies P:

<Mutterguy> didn't know there was such a thing.
<DeathStar> Offensive October rolles of the tounge more
<Venus> 08,01it's a celebration of inappropriate comedy, throughout the month of December
<Venus> 08,01the object is to be as un-PC as possible
<Moopy> wow really
<Chrysalis> this sounds good
<AdamTheDuck> ^

<Venus> 08,01Chrysalis: there's no such thing as too far during Offensive December!
<DeathStar> Venus: we need a map of the world with the sheep shaggers clearly marked XD
<Venus> 08,01DeathStar: now there's an idea

<Mutterguy> So what you need is muslim/neo-nazi focus groups?
<DeathStar> Venus: ooh ooh! or what about "jesus would love you if he existed"
<Venus> 08,01i could even do it just a map of the UK, marked "sheep shaggers" (highlands and wales), "pakistanis" (bradford), "dwarves" (yorkshire), etc.
<Vordox> Venus: And you?
<Mutterguy> how about a 'What would Hitler do?" t shirt?
<Venus> 08,01Mutterguy: i like it!

<AdamTheDuck> It didn't even have a song ;-;
<oni_link> It didnt... and the VA is annoying :|
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Part of the reason I'm upset is that I drew a picture and they deleted it because of the quote.
<AdamTheDuck> ;~;
<Shizuka> 13?
<Shizuka> 13oh
<Shizuka> 13it's nintendo
<oni_link> SuperBrony64 that sucks :|
*AdamTheDuck gives SuperBrony64 an internet cupcake to attempt to cheer him up
<Sumica> 00,10I seem to recall that comeing up with the nintendo approved comments discussion we had way back when they anounced wiiU present facebook
<Sumica> 00,10sucks they would do that
<SuperBrony64> 11,02They did, but their censorship sucks.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It's even worse than censoring the Sopranos on cable TV
<oni_link> you serious??
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'll show you the message I posted that they deleted.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Alright, refresh embed
<Sumica> 00,10hey Phase4, is it bad that I have to move my rockets to the runway to launch them?
<Buytoast> "With the new Wii U message system, talk to your friends and make new ones online! Warning: Posts must have the words Mario, Nintendo or Wii to be sent without termination of your account."

<Shizuka> 13doubt we have any paranoia players here..
<oni_link> those pics are great and they were already censored
<oni_link> damnit
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What's wrong with this?
<oni_link> nothing
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Buytoast> "With the new Own U administration system, FUN will be focused in a Nintendo friendly environment!"
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, thats a sign that you're doing it right
<Sumica> 00,10it's missing mario
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I wonder if I would get in trouble if I drew a Swastika.
<oni_link> IM sure you would XD
<Sumica> 00,10mecJeb ejected from my rocket
<aniderp> hi
<oni_link> might get kicked off the services
<Buytoast> "Hey Jeff, did you hear about the new NINTENDO 360 game?" "Yeah Paul, I heard that MARIO will be pulling out all the stops to make it it as fun as NEW SUPER MARIO BROS. 2."
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hey aniderp
<AdamTheDuck> Hello aniderp
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Take a look at these messages that I'm allowed to send to them
<Sumica> 00,10you would probably get a nice 350dollar paper weight SuperBrony64
<oni_link> I got kicked from brawl's online services for that on an older console
<oni_link> because of the taunt messages
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I would like them to explain to me what's wrong with the message I posted.
<oni_link> its dumb :I
<oni_link> you did nothing wrong
<oni_link> it wasnt vulgar
<oni_link> it wasnt offensive
<oni_link> and it was clearly censored
<aniderp> i missed what happend..
<Buytoast> But did it have the word Mario in it?
<AdamTheDuck> aniderp, SB's post was deleted because apparently he was violating the Miiverse Code of Conduct.
<Buytoast> If not, you broke the rules."
<AdamTheDuck> "apparently"
<oni_link> mariomariomario
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Here's the Miiverse Code of Conduct
<oni_link> apparantly cartoon violence is offensive *shrugs*
<oni_link> and it was implied anyways, not shown
<Moopy> wow those guys are stupid
<oni_link> and not aimed at anyone
<oni_link> maybe its infringing SuperBrony64 ?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Why wasn't the Beavis and Butthead drawing removed then?
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<AdamTheDuck> It was his 2nd drawing that was removed.
<AdamTheDuck> Not the first
<oni_link> I guess someone got "offended"
<aniderp> how do you make friends over the wii u connection wouthout sharinf fc?
<oni_link> this makes me mad , not to mention that I saw that Metro is getting the plug pulled
<AdamTheDuck> SuperBrony64, are you able to write a ticket to ask why it was deleted?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02My ticket is 'Hey my thing didn't violate the code'
<SuperBrony64> 11,02That's all I can do from what it looks like
<oni_link> which is dumb
<Shizuka> 13yeah i doubt you'll win that
<oni_link> they make it so one sided
<Shizuka> 13consoles!
<oni_link> you cant even appeal
<oni_link> This is why Im saving up for a good PC and laptop. consoles upset me now
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This kind of thing makes me not want to post messages on Miiverse anymore.
<oni_link> I can see why
<Moopy> Hey SuperBrony64 do you have the box that has the Wii U phone number on there to call them talked to them about that drawing you did?

<KrazyNoobs> I don't know why, but whenever someone posts a link on here, I just click on it. I only regret it very few times.
<oni_link> ^
<SuperBrony64> 11,02We responded to him.
<aniderp> i only click a link sometimes xD
<Sumica> 00,10the pop out player oni_link
<SuperBrony64> 11,02We denied his appeal.
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 what did they delete?
<KrazyNoobs> Then click on this: http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/435318-gak One of the reasons I love Bronystate.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02JRP2234: They deleted this...
<oni_link> Sumica: hmm... I guess I never noticed
<KrazyNoobs> Damnn.... should have seen that one coming. :(
<JRP2234> cartman?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02No, this that has 'Deleted by administrator'
<oni_link> KrazyNoobs: if that word is in anything you post, it auto kicks XD
<JRP2234> nintendo WHAT THE FUCK
<KrazyNoobs> I know, I have had a few experiences, two with typos.
<KrazyNoobs> That's in the picture I put up.
<KrazyNoobs> I got a paddlin'
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 what else
<KrazyNoobs> Did anyone actually look at that picture? I just experienced that.
<KrazyNoobs> LITERALLY EXPERIENCED IT
<KrazyNoobs> Gawd, I love Bronystate.
<Sumica> 00,10post things on wiiU, dats a padd'en
<Moopy> brb

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Awesome :D
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 show me the message they sentyou
<KrazyNoobs> At least we don't get a paddlin' during the new episodes. I thank you mods for that, we FEED OFF typing the g-word into your chatroom during a fresh new episode.
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 i missed it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02JRP2234: They just said it violated the Miiverse Code of Conduct.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Not specifically what I violated.
<JRP2234> ring them
<oni_link> very unfair
<KrazyNoobs> Be right back... and yes, I could leave my system unattended. My brother is at school camp for 2 weeks.
<KrazyNoobs> My other brother respects my privacy, and my little sister doesn't know how to type.
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 weby show us the controller
<JRP2234> with the webcam
<ponyman> how many zombies are there with me? xD
<JRP2234> chat ded
<Sumica> 00,10hmmmm the panic button on the mechJeb seems to be the blow shit up button
<SuperBrony64> 11,02On the plus side, I bought a USB cable today that allows me to charge my Wii U GamePad from the console itself rather than the AC Adaptor.
<Phase4> k
<oni_link> wait, the gamepad has an AC adapter?
<oni_link> is that what comes with it?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yeah
<oni_link> not a fan of those :I
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 show us the controller
<JRP2234> webcam
<oni_link> at least theres a USB though
<SuperBrony64> 11,02That cable I bought today advertises that it works with the 3DS and DSi, which it does not as the connector is different. I messaged Nyko (the one who made the cable) about it today on Twitter. The post I gave earlier was the response when I brought it up. They apologized that future box art wouldn't have that error on it.
<oni_link> and a new cable on the way I hope
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Nah, that cable is just meant for charging the Wii U Gamepad.
<oni_link> oh
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The connector looked similar to the 3DS and DSi so they thought it would work with that too.
<oni_link> ah so they dun goofed bad
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 we like your face
<oni_link> this is true :3
<aniderp> hm
<aniderp> im getting wii u in 2014 :P

<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back Moopy :P
*AdamTheDuck licks Moopy
<Moopy> eww why did you just lick me?
<AdamTheDuck> Because you taste like moop Moopy .-.
<Moopy> Ummm ok
<KrazyNoobs> Ducks cannot extend their tongues past their beaks. It's duck anatomical fact.
<KrazyNoobs> Therefore, ducks cannot lick anything.
*AdamTheDuck ish an internet duck >.>
<Moopy> and how do i taste like moop?
<aniderp> -pokes the duck-
<AdamTheDuck> Your argument is invalid.
<KrazyNoobs> -pokes dolan-
<KrazyNoobs> -gets raepd
<AdamTheDuck> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5732/
<KrazyNoobs> -he sez-

*AdamTheDuck licks aniderp :3
<KrazyNoobs> -u aksd fur et-
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64
<oni_link> AdamTheDuck: full of d'aww
*AdamTheDuck wants a pet cat named Octavia :3
<KrazyNoobs> How are actions preformed, such as, X did [something] to Y? Do you need special priviledges to do that?
<KrazyNoobs> I am not too familiar with the multiple functions of PonyChat.
*AdamTheDuck asks if KrazyNoobs means the way I am speaking right now?
<KrazyNoobs> -says yes, knowing that he has miserably failed at trying what AdamTheDuck did-
<aniderp> put /me in front of a message
*aniderp rolls around the room
*KrazyNoobs Hi!
*AdamTheDuck simply tells KrazyNoobs that it is simple and all one requires to do is to type /me before typing
*KrazyNoobs Gives a huge thanks to AdamTheDuck and aniderp
*AdamTheDuck flails his arms about as he runs around chat
*KrazyNoobs types /me before a message
*JRP2234 slaps SuperBrony64 around a bit with a large trout
*KrazyNoobs needs a dispenser in this very spot
<AdamTheDuck> Try not to go overboard on the /me though
*KrazyNoobs AdamTheDuck created a monster on this chat.
<AdamTheDuck> Extreme RP is bannable.
<KrazyNoobs> Just kiddin'
<KrazyNoobs> But seriously, it is a pretty cool function.
<Moopy> Hey i got a question for everypony on bronystate and be honest with me: Did you guys already have the Christmas stuff up already?
<oni_link> I do
<aniderp> we started to decorate the room
<AdamTheDuck> Moopy, nope.
<Moopy> hmmmmm
<Moopy> wish i can help
*KrazyNoobs puts on his coolface
<aniderp> shall we finish decorating bronystate?
<Moopy> yup
<aniderp> i can putting tinsel up
<aniderp> its shiny :>
<KrazyNoobs> Christmas? What are you talking about? Never heard of it.
<Moopy> Its a holiday KrazyNoobs
<KrazyNoobs> Now when are you guys gonna do something with Hearth's Warming Eve?
<aniderp> we are
<aniderp> gyrobowl is the topper
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<aniderp> on the tree
<KrazyNoobs> I was implying that with us bronies, Christmas doesn't exist on the internet. Only Hearth's Warming Eve does.
<Moopy> Oh hey guys hehehehehe i have a pickle ornament on my christmas tree hahahahahaha
<aniderp> our tree not up yet
<Moopy> my tree over here is already up
<KrazyNoobs> In Australia, we just decorate our native Norfolk Pines. THey grow up to 35m (around 110 feet) high. Always fun to decorate.
<aniderp> the base is but
<aniderp> need to be put together
<KrazyNoobs> Our class had 5 trees in our vicinity. The 5 out of 19 bronies in the class took one of them and did JUST PONY.
<aniderp> i need a pony on the tree
<aniderp> derpy ornament and dash ornament
<KrazyNoobs> Although the Year 3s asked if they could join in, and they brought their sh--ty G3 ponies in, and started hanging them up. We had to tolerate them, but we were pissed.
<KrazyNoobs> The tree was once beautiful, but now honestly sucks. Us Year 12s had a good tree, and the Year 1s and 3s wrecked it.
<aniderp> i need a zelda tree.. and a pony tree..
<KrazyNoobs> We used hand-made clay pony ornaments. They looked like crap, and we also used McDonalds pony toys that we had.
<oni_link> aniderp: this is relevant to my interests :3
<aniderp> it is?
<oni_link> aniderp: yes
<aniderp> i love zelda stuff
*aniderp snuggles her zelda blanket
<KrazyNoobs> Anyone here still going through school? If so, any bronies in your class?
<oni_link> me too , I have a triforce wallet, I want a link plushie though
<aniderp> there are some bronies at work i guess..
<KrazyNoobs> 5 of the kids in my Year 12 class are bronies.
<oni_link> well Im in between jobs so this question isnt for me lol
<aniderp> lets see.. marissa asks me if i watch the episode on saturday
<aniderp> that count?
<aniderp> pony spin(vinyl on record) my freind likes that one
<aniderp> its like filly vinyl on a record going along to watch out here she comes
<KrazyNoobs> One of the marine biologists I work with at UnderWater World Mooloolaba (wierd Aussie names) like G3. She hates what happened to the show, so I hate her.
<oni_link> haha wow
<aniderp> least vanessa dont play g3..
<aniderp> she plays g1 sometimes..
<KrazyNoobs> What I mean is, she loves G3, hates G4. I hate people like that, but still tolerate them... hope no g3 people in here that i offended, if so, sorry
<aniderp> sea ponies shoo be doo
<KrazyNoobs> The first G1 promo was Okay, I guess.
<KrazyNoobs> The second one still was barely watchable, but not too bad.
<KrazyNoobs> The third one and all of the G1 from there on, in my opinion, stunk.
<KrazyNoobs> But really, how could someone actually mindlessly sit at a screen and enjoy something that had little effort put into it, and was a marketing scheme for 3 - 5 year old girls? The first two episodes of G1 didn't stink too bad, but from there on, I didn't like it. G2 was quite interesting, with the urban setting, but still sucked in my opinion. No offence to those whose childhood consisted of mainly this. With G3, I don'
<oni_link> I thought there was no G2
<AdamTheDuck> ^ I miss Val correcting everyone ;~;
<oni_link> aw :<
<KrazyNoobs> btw, my little sister watched G3 all the time when she was 4, the same episode over and over again. It was called Starsong's Song. I would go for a thirty minute bikeride everytime she watched this. I became fit.
<oni_link> wow
<KrazyNoobs> G2 existed, but it wasn't anything special. Just like G1 ponies, except in a retro-urban setting, with houses, tvs, radios, gyms, shops... everything a little girl would enjoy, but not us.
<RawketLawnchair> This is stupid.
<KrazyNoobs> Too much 'icky romantic' stuff in there too.
<KrazyNoobs> That's what I told my friends as a youngster.
<oni_link> RawketLawnchair: beep boop son
<oni_link> youre on "Off the Air"
<KrazyNoobs> But really, the primary focus was... *inhales dramatically* ... boys. The girl ponies had crushes on the male ponies, but the male ponies were huge jerks, so the morals were warped and completely wrong.
<RawketLawnchair> Beep boop.
*AdamTheDuck boops oni_link
<oni_link> beep o.o
<oni_link> I am a robot
<aniderp> brb
*KrazyNoobs KrazyNoobs catches his breath after his explanation... wait, he typed.
*KrazyNoobs he rested his fingers. THERE>
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Mooo \:D/
<AdamTheDuck> Mooooo
*KrazyNoobs Tips the cow.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
*KrazyNoobs realises he said that to an admin. Puts a gun to his head.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02D:
<oni_link> okay lets tone down the RP in here
<SuperBrony64> 11,02nuuuuuuu
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Also what oni_link said
<AdamTheDuck> oni_link, ^
<AdamTheDuck> Remember, excessive RP is bannable.
<KrazyNoobs> What's wrong with italic?
<oni_link> :D
<oni_link> why does Duke Nukem Forever suck so much :I
<oni_link> its trying too hard and its too little, too late
<RawketLawnchair> SuperBrony64: Where the streams at
<Moopy> Pinkie is funny sometimes heh fun fun fun fun fun
<KrazyNoobs> Season 3 summary:

<KrazyNoobs> WHAT NEXT!?
<RawketLawnchair> Trrrrrling rs from Trrrrixie.
<Moopy> Oh no not trixie
<oni_link> Ive always like Pinkie Pie, she just became my favorite between season 2 and 3 though :P
<oni_link> Thanks to FiW
<KrazyNoobs> I liked her from Season 2 Episode 24 to Season 3 Episode 4 so far.
<AdamTheDuck> SO MUCH ADORABLENESS With G3, I don'
<AdamTheDuck> <oni_li
<AdamTheDuck> Fuck
<gunthler> SB, I put together a Dashie gif site from scratch :3
<AdamTheDuck> why'd it copy that?
<gunthler> http://derpy.me/Woa1a
<AdamTheDuck> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me0h5qsLIb1rz0q8co1_250.gif
<AdamTheDuck> There we go.
<Moopy> but that was weird pinkie made her face into a g3 pinkie i was like whow
<KrazyNoobs> YAY ANIMATion
<RawketLawnchair> Moopy: What fourth wall?
<KrazyNoobs> Sweetie Drink from a straw... that's a paddlin'
<KrazyNoobs> LOL
<Moopy> no not the 4th wall
<SuperBrony64> 11,02RawketLawnchair: Refresh embed
<KrazyNoobs> http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/435318-XXX replace the XXX with that gooey stuff
<oni_link> gunthler: Im going to take a shot in the dark here and say RD is your favorite
<gunthler> probably, oni_link.
<oni_link> lol
*KrazyNoobs avoided a paddlin
<RawketLawnchair> SuperBrony64: I refeshed everything. NO streams here. . .
<MadSurge> Good morning Bronystate! :$
<KrazyNoobs> The new stream doesn't work for me.
<KrazyNoobs> Hey MadSurge.
<oni_link> AdamTheDuck: I actually like Scootaloo in this episode but I still like Sweetie Belle and Applebloom more
<AdamTheDuck> I like Sweetie Belle the most out of the CMC :3
<RawketLawnchair> All I've got is the Twitch embed.
<oni_link> is good pony :3
<KrazyNoobs> Finally, an RD gallery without that... shot... that /mlp/ likes from S2E07... *shrugs at the thought of it*
<oni_link> SuperBrony64: Me too, Ive been refreshing and I dont has stream :<
<KrazyNoobs> I don't want to --- i-s-d- r------ ----
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What browser are you using?
<oni_link> Firefox
<KrazyNoobs> I like this picture of her, but /mlp/ ruined it. I thought it was a good picture before it was defiled in such a manner. http://archive.heinessen.com/boards/mlp/thumb/0042/18/1346300462472s.jpg is the picture, putting aside the meme that got attached to it, do YOU think it's a good picture? Reminds me of a cat.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02How bout now?
<oni_link> now I got it!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sweet :)
<RawketLawnchair> Groovy
<AdamTheDuck> Yup
<AdamTheDuck> BO2 is up.
<oni_link> KrazyNoobs: Its like meh. I personally like the one where she's messing with the guards
<oni_link> dat emblem :3
<KrazyNoobs> Same. /mlp/ tied a disturbing meme to that picture I just put up. http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-want-to-cum-inside-rainbow-dash here's the meme if you are curious, but it has iffy content.
<oni_link> Pinkie giving Rainbow Dash an epic hoof
<oni_link> KrazyNoobs: I can see by the link
<oni_link> careful now
<KrazyNoobs> Yup... cannot unsee
<KrazyNoobs> Aw, crap, I see what I did there.
*KrazyNoobs slaps himself.
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 weby
<KrazyNoobs> I still think (here comes a paddlin') gak is funny.
<KrazyNoobs> You should probably investigate further into ways to prevent chatroom guests from mentioning that g-word. They can just say g a k, or say g - a - k. If I get a paddlin' I would know that you guys are responsible, and have it under control.
<KrazyNoobs> No? Should probably get that fixed. An easy way for offenders to say that.
<oni_link> well yeah i think its meant as an anti-flood mechanism
<oni_link> thats it really
<oni_link> just so there arent text walls full of that word
<oni_link> and cause im guessing people are getting tired of it
<oni_link> I might get this game but for 360
<oni_link> Can't run it on PC and all my friends own 360s
<RawketLawnchair> Kaboom
<oni_link> I can run MW2 and MW3 but I kinda don't like those games
*AdamTheDuck rolls around ded chat
<SuperBrony64> 11,02crud
<KrazyNoobs> I love the explosions that occur with 2000 people spamming with that word during a ga-k commercial. The comment you say with g-- g-- -ak only is around for 1.5 seconds or less. I love BronyState.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02>more points
<SuperBrony64> 11,02>2nd place
<oni_link> woot woot 2nd
*KrazyNoobs will be right back after these messages. *4 --- commercials in a row*
<Sumica> 00,10dat network loss
<oni_link> and then someone rage quit and disconneted :I
<KrazyNoobs> brb
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Now then, to see if Nintendo relisted my post
<oni_link> here we go
<KrazyNoobs> im abck
<KrazyNoobs> *I'm back.
<KrazyNoobs> By the way, what do I do if the stream will not work for me. Do I need to download any specific plugin?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02No, just go to the link provided in the stream embed
<oni_link> looks like this isn't going to get re-upped :|
*KrazyNoobs tried again and it worked. Fails to withdraw previous comment.
*KrazyNoobs will now stop abusing RP
<oni_link> thanks
<oni_link> lol
<JRP2234> is this a resistive touchscreen SuperBrony64?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yeah
<JRP2234> no
<JRP2234> NINTENDO WTF Y NO CAPACITIVE TOUCH SCREEN
*aniderp dies
<Sumica> 00,10that might just be the strangest thing you have said
*KrazyNoobs is already in love with the RP function... cannot... stop...
<KrazyNoobs> But I have to.
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 complaine to nintendo FOR NOT PUTING A PROPER TOUCH SCREEN ON THE CONTROLLER
<KrazyNoobs> The only thing I complain about
<KrazyNoobs> is complaining
<KrazyNoobs> Another thing I complain about
<KrazyNoobs> is the paddlins you get when discussing g-k.
<KrazyNoobs> Actually, I like it.
<KrazyNoobs> It's good at any time except during the episode. Us bronies NEED to g-kspam during a new episode.
<oni_link> Well damn I wasn't expecting much but I did better than I thought for this year's Famicompo-mini (achiptune competition) . I placed 33rd out of 48 entries for the originals section and 62nd out of 90 entries for the covers section :3
*KrazyNoobs is not sure whether anyone is here or nobody cares
<Jmo> Latter.
<oni_link> Im going to upload my entries to my YouTube within the next week :3
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 wake up
<KrazyNoobs> The whole chatroom is asleep. LOL

<Bronysith> http://ponceysounds.tumblr.com/image/36552956606

<Bronysith> Friendliness is not welcome
<Buytoast> this isn't a friendly place at all
<Buytoast> where have you been for the past hour
<dishwasher> well this is a friendly place when we make it so , how are we going to do that if you guys dont just relax and chill out
<Cypresswolf> readying for work :S - should be leaving now, but this 4 day weekend has made me a touch lazy.....lazier
<dishwasher> and all of this tension for a matter pf personal interests .come on relaxx
<dishwasher> *of
<Cypresswolf> as long as I get there around 7, no one's gonna care
<aniderp> its past 7..
<dishwasher> its 7 30 here
<Cypresswolf> not here :) I'm an hour behind you
<aniderp> oh
<pony_587700> Buytoast: 'Emo McPissfoot', eh? I'm flattered, but I'm not sure if you can really talk on the whole 'emo' front, seeing as you're essentially a less amusing, less likeable version of Meanwhile.
<ScootaChicken> Whoops.
<Bronysith> and heres the man of the hour "drum roll" ScootaChicken
<dishwasher> hello
<Ponies47> Morning
<ScootaChicken> Bronysith: I just felt it was unfair that you and Jmo were defending me all on your lonesome, I'm a big boy after all, I can look after myself :P
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: you werent here though mate
<ScootaChicken> Well I'm here now ^_^
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: and i hate seeing people insulted for their hard work
<ScootaChicken> >hard work
<dishwasher> what work?
<Cypresswolf> O_o...that's quite a switch - playlist chose a Tenacious D's Beelzebub after Winter Jazz Up ended - Damn You Playlist >_<
<ScootaChicken> >clothes from my wardrobe and poorly applied makeup
<ScootaChicken> Lel.
<dishwasher> oooooooooohhh
<Buytoast> i'm guessing that's the guy from the barefoot picture?
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: considering you were walking around everwhere, barefoot
<dishwasher> the cosplay thing
<ScootaChicken> Bronysith: Hardly a big deal, I did DofE :P
<dishwasher> walking barefoot is not that bad
<Cypresswolf> I'm the DEVIL I Love Metal!
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: but your feet were murder right?
<ScootaChicken> Weren't too bad to be honest.
<Buytoast> so did he just come here to whine about me not liking him playing dress up or what?
<Cypresswolf> *sings aloud in an overacting manner*
<Bronysith> Buytoast: theres opinions, then theres insulting people for what they enjoy
<ScootaChicken> Buytoast: Do you see me whining?
<Buytoast> you were a bit ago mate
<Buytoast> although i do have a question for ya
<Buytoast> were you on a bus or a train?
<Buytoast> cause i don't know of many trains with cushiony seats
<Cypresswolf> :3 That's enough of that....I think my brother heard that one :D
<ScootaChicken> Calling me 'Emo McPissfaggot' is hardly going to get me to think you're a paragon of virtue and goodwill.
<Buytoast> i don't care
<dishwasher> relaxxxx dudes. like you said this is the internet and there something that peple like and others that people dont
<Buytoast> i don't even know who you are
<ScootaChicken> And I was on a London Underground train.
<Buytoast> ah
<Buytoast> fancy ass train
<Buytoast> looked like one of those luxary shuttle things
<ScootaChicken> Hardly, most underground trains smell like piss and boozy vomit.
<Buytoast> well yeah
<Buytoast> i take the L to my classes
<Buytoast> but your trains look better than mine
<dishwasher> we dont even have subways
<ScootaChicken> What country do you live in?
<Buytoast> MURIKA
<ScootaChicken> I dunno about trains in MURICA, guessing they have plastic seats then?
<Buytoast> the ones i ride do
<dishwasher> heck we dont even have quality buses here
<Cypresswolf> Sleepy chat - Wake Up http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo1d26Y5LiY
<ScootaChicken> Basically every bus and train in England has fancy cushiony seats, which is nice I suppose.
*aniderp clings onto someone
<Buytoast> damn
<aniderp> dont make me go to work ;_;
<Colgate> Shiiieett
*Bronysith drags aniderp to work
<aniderp> nuuu
<Buytoast> only thing i rode on with cushiony seats was that one shuttle to that comic con thing back in march or some shit
<Buytoast> now that was comfy
<ScootaChicken> Although they really aren't as comfortable as they look, seeing as they tend to have chewing gum stuck to every seat.
<JRP2234> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Buytoast> damn man, don't dissipate my illusions of granduer
