<derpy_pony> next pilot plz
<Sumica> 00,10Raining blood
<Meanwhile> Auto Terminate.
<Randomnerd> Snuffsis: That was the reaction it caused in its designers, I think, hence the name.
<Ninjazz2> Holy... shit.
<Meanwhile> Agamemnons Toenail.
<Meanwhile> AT really doesn't have much fun for abbreviations.

<Snuffsis> Cicadas sound lovely
<Simon2> Sumica: glitch or insects?
<Sumica> 00,10we get tons of em here in vegas
<Ninjazz2> We should watch Higarashi No Naku Koro Ni. Sumica would love it.
<Meanwhile> Sound only.
<Meanwhile> Because they couldn't afford webcam
<Snuffsis> That show isn't really fit for Bronystate. :P
<Twi_Fi> Pony movie
<Kandarihu> Perhaps a better way to deconstruct it is to start where most of the viewer's attitude is and subvert it.
<Sumica> 00,10incects
<Ninjazz2> The freakin title means when the cicaidas cry.
<Chrysalis> FIM? or previous gen?
<Snuffsis> Yea, but the show is fucked up.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah that might be a bit too much for chat
<Sumica> 00,10and I have already seen it
<Ninjazz2> How so?
<Twi_Fi> Gen 4
<Kandarihu> Like have Shinji actually WANT to pilot the Eva, but 01 doesn't do as he wants. Everything that could possibly go wrong goes wrong.
<Phase4> i cant wait for a soundtrack
<Twi_Fi> I want to see one.
<Phase4> ^
<Sumica> 00,10right up there with elfin lied
<Snuffsis> Because of people in the town going crazy murdering everyone and stuff like that. :P
<Chrysalis> Phase4 Agreed
<Phase4> gen 4 movie would be epic
<Chrysalis> would love to see a proper sound track from the 2 seasons
<Kandarihu> Okay. He merely wants to meet his father. At least let him readily acc... meh
<Ninjazz2> Ahhh now I see what your talking about.
<Snuffsis> Elfen Lied isn't as crazy, but it sure is just as bloody. :P
<Vordox> Something "Appropriate" for the chat, FLCL. XD
<Twi_Fi> The finale hints that an awesome movie would be possible.
<Phase4> is there plans to release a soundtack yet? with this day aria out its worth something
<Meanwhile> That kid is a bitch.
<Sumica> 00,10I have shown FLCL many a time
<Twi_Fi> A soundtrack would be appreciated.
<Spectrum_Rush> awkward
<Vordox> Aww damnit
<Twi_Fi> I'd buy it.
<Ninjazz2> Have you shown Lucky Star? XD
<Sumica> 00,10no
<Phase4> i suspect they are watching what bronies thing about the show, we're large and smart enough to provide very usefull feedback
<Ninjazz2> Good.
<Sumica> 00,10but the rage would be epic
<Vordox> Excel Saga, Puni Puni Poemi? :D
<Snuffsis> Sumica, have you shown Sakigake!! Cromartie High School?
<Sumica> 00,10DCD was doing Cromate
<Kandarihu> I heard that FLCL was a vacation from Eva. That the production team had been working on Eva so much, that they consiered it a holiday to be working on something that had virtually nothing to do with Eva
<Phase4> s/thing/think
<Sumica> 00,10have showen Excell
<Snuffsis> Cool, Freddie!
<Mutterguy> So the maple syrup bottling plant exploding would be bad timing?
<Twi_Fi> Lawson!
<Twi_Fi> lol
<Vordox> DAMNIT why did I miss that?! I'll become a lurker here from now on
<Kandarihu> And Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann... that was technically an APOLOGY TO EVERYONE for Eva
<Spectrum_Rush> dat product placement
<Sumica> 00,10We show man things here
<Ninjazz2> I thought the whole city was just destroyed?...
<Phase4> perhaps someone could bother ingram about a soundtrack
<Ninjazz2> wth city make up your mind.
<Chrysalis> i think more show-faithful merchandise wouldnt go amiss
<Spectrum_Rush> ooh how about pant and stocking with garterbelt
<Kandarihu> Maybe those things aren't true.
<Sumica> 00,10it was the subburbs of the city
<Spectrum_Rush> panty*
<Sumica> 00,10the realy city was hideing
<Kandarihu> This is what wasn't destroyed.
<Ninjazz2> Wow...
<Snuffsis> Sexy Commando Gaiden: Sugoi yo! Masaru-san! That is something that needs to be shown, if it hasn't already. :P
<The> What
<Ninjazz2> WOW...
<Twi_Fi> After the city gets destroyed a few times, special measures are taken.
<Spectrum_Rush> wowee
<Lasharus> Hey, it's only sensible Twi_Fi.
<Ninjazz2> What happened to Tokyo 2?
<Sumica> 00,10the city goes under ground to defend
<Lasharus> After it looks like it'll start to become a habit, try to do something about it, really :P
<Sumica> 00,10it got blowen up
<Ninjazz2> Obviously...
<RainbowAsh> Sumica: So he defended the city while it was still underground?
<RainbowAsh> What a hipster
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Ninjazz2> Oh! Did you show Gantz?
<Kandarihu> I guess everyone in Tokyo-3 would be advised that any building they might be in will drop to below the Geofront with very little warning at any time.
<Lasharus> Whoo product placement :P
<Simon2> not sure what 葛城 means
<Spectrum_Rush> ow ears
<Ninjazz2> Ow...
<Sumica> 00,10more or less yeah
<Lasharus> Moderately so.
<Sumica> 00,10the city is built to be a fort
<Spectrum_Rush> o///o
<Sumica> 00,10you will see more of it
<Lasharus> Most fortresses don't sink into the ground.
<RainbowAsh> All the beers
<Lasharus> Unless we're talking Castle Figaro (yay Final Fantasy VI)
<Ninjazz2> This girl needs a trash can.
<Simon2> lol
<Kandarihu> But for the entire city to drop below an impregnable shield every time there's an attack. I'm sure the Israelis would love to see that happen in real life.
<somepony_else> pen² <3

<Meanwhile> Twice the pen.

<Lasharus> ...Sumica, I pray you never get your hooves on an actual weapon...
*Sumica has a militamans license.
<RainbowAsh> If they wouldn't try a lot of military stuff that doesn't do anything at all the series would only be half as long
<Lasharus> Oh dear lord we're all doomed.
*CloverMuffins wants a zombie apocalypse

*Phase4 would love to setup a bot that kicks on 7 in 10
*pablez94 thanks CloverMuffins for the greetings and kisses him on the forehead

<Ninjazz> You must be new here.
<OtakuTom> A body swap episode would be hilarious
<pablez94> CloverMuffins: still don't get it maybe i'm stupid...
<twilight_sprinkle> why would anyone want somepony instead of Twi
<Ninjazz> Uhhh. Cause Rarity...
<Spectrum_Rush> cough Luna
<otakon17> twilight_sprinkle: Magic teleportation gone wrong
<CloverMuffins> pablez94: no, I think it's hard to explain. I'm in love with ponies as they are and am not too fond of too much deviation.
<OtakuTom> Fluttershy for me :3
<Twi_Fi> Strange, I didn't turn up the volume and yet......
<DavidCortez> Good morning everypony :)

<Dishwasher_EXTREME> EPIC WUB
<Randomnerd> That_British_Guy: Oh, That_British_Guy, something wonderful....
<CloverMuffins> came for the ponies. staying for the awesome.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> ^
<Dark92Enigma> OK, i mark out everytime i see Luna, and Derpy, And Lyra, Dr Whooves, Colgate, etc.......but i feel identified with Twilight <3
<That_British_Guy> You only need to type my name once :/
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> he draw very well indeed just take to much time
<Twi_Fi> That_British_Guy:
<pablez94> CloverMuffins: ah NOW i get it... well i just love them for they represent not for how they are drawn
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> wrek seem low on ideas
<That_British_Guy> or not
<Dark92Enigma> aND WHEN i say Mark Out, that's a wrestling term for fanboy/fangirl scream (fanboy in my case, btw)
<CloverMuffins> pablez94: I guess it's an individual thing...
*Ninjazz|SPAZ is not a fan of wrestling
<CloverMuffins> cool tunes bro
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> wwe is fake
<That_British_Guy> I <3 Coldplay
<pablez94> CloverMuffins: yep me too
<Twi_Fi> So many topics.
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> funky music
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> That_British_Guys: I don't really like Coldplay... XD
<Dark92Enigma> that's ok.............
<CloverMuffins> pablez94: IMO there is too many humans and not enough ponies in this reality :P
<Twi_Fi> Twilight is reading a book, so cute!
<CloverMuffins> and she's reading FAST
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> what if equestria was real??
<pablez94> CloverMuffins: yep but avoid reality will not help ya <3
<Sumica> 00,10nice drop
<Twi_Fi> Dishwasher_EXTREME, implying that it's not.
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> yes but WHAT IF IT WAS
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> Dishwasher_EXTREME: I WOULD GO TO EQUESTRIA, TRANSFORM INTO A PONY AND GO ON AN ADVENTURE WITH RAINBOW DASH~!
<Sumica> 00,10ug, speaking to a beat
<Twi_Fi> It would be sooooo awesome!
<CloverMuffins> pablez94: actually it does help. helps me at least :P
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> horses will be loved even more then
<CloverMuffins> I like to think I'll be able to get there somewhere. It's just a world of dreams, but it doesn't make it unreal, just... unlikely...
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> how would u describe yourself as a pony
<pablez94> CloverMuffins: oh well u will have to back to reality... so don't avoid too much... face it!
<Sumica> 00,10this pose it has pontential to be awsome
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> I always talk about going to Equestria just plain awkward.
<That_British_Guy> or something sexy
<Kammerjunk> Paranoia, paranoia, everybody's coming to get me.
<That_British_Guy> :P
<Sumica> 00,10Sexy is awsome
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> that pose is a bit arkward
<That_British_Guy> Sumica /)
<twilight_sprinkle> sexy Twi pics give me cancer
<Sumica> 00,10(\
<CloverMuffins> pablez94: I'm tired of this reality, really. I'm sticking to it as long as it provides me with ponies. Even if just a little bit.
<Spectrum_Rush> so what Program is Wrek using?
<RX-78|Sitemaking> Otakon its not nice to kill the channel
<Sumica> 00,10SAI
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> Frankly: I am hoping that I would be able to start a new life as a pony (preferably as a Pegasus Pony) in Equestria once I finish my time in this world.
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> but reality had pizza and indoor toilet

*pablez94 brohoofs Ninjazz|SPAZ
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> :3
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> the pose seems weird
<CloverMuffins> pablez94: Thanks, I really appreciate it. But it's really hard for me to be happy in this reality as it imposes many, many constraints on me and... I know, I should be happy with what I got, but I just can't right now...
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> pablez94: I laughed...
<Sumica> 00,10yay
<Sumica> 00,10always good to see you push your self wrek. Some of your best stuff happens
<pablez94> CloverMuffins: how old are u?
<That_British_Guy> 10 Bits says its gonna be Twilight
<Kammerjunk> CloverMuffins: Don't be content, give physics a dent!
<CloverMuffins> pablez94: why?
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> wtf r we talking about friendship now?
<That_British_Guy> I think.....
<hazhat> What program is that? My resolution is poor...
<Sumica> 00,10I will take the vegas odds on that That_British_Guy =p
<Kammerjunk> hazhat: Magic Picture Maker SS6.
<CloverMuffins> Kammerjunk: sounds fun :P
<Sumica> 00,10Program is SAI
<hazhat> Cheers!
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> friendship taste delicious
<Kammerjunk> Friendship tastes like chicken.
<Sumica> 00,10I think it's a puma, it looks like a puma
<Wrek> 05brb gona put on my drawing bandage
<CloverMuffins> that is one twisted looking Twilight ;D
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> CloverMuffins: Reality isn't kind, when trouble comes, you have to be brave and face it face to face and deal with it
<That_British_Guy> Friendship is Family (Godfather Refernce)
<Twi_Fi> sunglasses?
<Simon2> Is this redline?
<Kammerjunk> _xXiaoDrag0n_: That's life. Harsh but unfair.
<Sumica> 00,10dont think so
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> what r we talkin about?
<Sumica> 00,10Sounds like infected mushroom
<Kammerjunk> Dishwasher_EXTREME: Everything and nothing.
<CloverMuffins> _xXiaoDrag0n_: yeah, I know that. I'm doing it all the time. I'm used to this reality by now, but it's just painful.
<Shane377> sweet wrek is drawing
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> seriously dude....
<pablez94> CloverMuffins: there's a period in everyone life when u think that your life is crappy and is going to be even crappy...nowadays it's even more difficoult to pass over it but if u do u'll realize how stupid u were thinking to that stuff... i just passed it...:)
<Kammerjunk> Dishwasher_EXTREME: But we are!
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> Kammerjunk: I almost met an car accident twice today, AWESOME~!
<Kammerjunk> It's accurate, really.
<That_British_Guy> I like it when my life is crappy :)
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> i had a pretty normal happy day
<Chrysalis> man why does every math resource assume you know what the symbols mean
<Shane377> well night all
<Kammerjunk> _xXiaoDrag0n_: I am jelly. Once when I was in a bus (Which by itself is rare), some car crashed right in front of the bus. The busdriver must have been the goddamn Batman or something, because he just steered around it like a boss and drove on.
<Kammerjunk> Sweet dreams, Shizuschlafen.
<Kammerjunk> Shane377.
<Twi_Fi> When I think about how crappy my life is sometimes I then think back to times when my life was a pure dung heap.
<Kammerjunk> Goddammittabkey.
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> That_British_Guy: So that you can know whom are your true friends?
<Spectrum_Rush> nite Shane377
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> friendship is sandwich
<RX-78|Sitemaking> Becuase the vast majority of mathematical symbols are universal?
<Twi_Fi> And then, I don't feel so bad.
<Kandarihu> So, this Sai program that Wrek is using... I just realized that it's shareware and cripple's it's Save/Load functions after 31 days.
<Wrek> 05nothing helps an aching wrist liek some eze gel, couple o´painkillers and a supportive bandage
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> Kammerjunk: Like a boss~!
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Dat meds
<That_British_Guy> That...and when its a crappy day i can look back and see how it makes me stronger
<Chrysalis> yes, but it needs a point of reference
<Kandarihu> So, no thanks. I'll just stick with Gimp
<CloverMuffins> pablez94: my life is decent, I guess. as in in this reality, but I don't belong here. that's how I feel. at least I found all of my lovely bronies here and there and I love you all very much :) you bring joy to my heart and I'm a lot less dark person than I was before.
<Chrysalis> english words all use the same alphabet
<Kammerjunk> CloverMuffins: So it's safe to say that you're a spiritual person?
<Rukario> HyperMetalLugia more DOS :D
<Chrysalis> of no use to someone who uses katakana
<CloverMuffins> dayum, look at me spilling the beans xD
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> bye guys
<Randomnerd> Kandarihu: I hav Gimp, wihich is odd. I'm a terrible artist.
<Randomnerd> Bye, Dishwasher_EXTREME
<That_British_Guy> Wrek maybe you should take a break from drawing for awhile
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, Dishwasher_EXTREME.
<Kammerjunk> goddammit
<pablez94> form all da bronies: that's our thank to u HUB DFXmedia & HASBRO! hope u enjoy!!!
<pablez94> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/173085
<CloverMuffins> Kammerjunk: well, I'm certainly looking for truth of life. so, I guess spiritual is a good word, just not in the traditional/religious sense.
<HyperMetalLugia> :333333333
<HyperMetalLugia> What commands?
<HyperMetalLugia> did u write batch file":?

<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Ahhh Dat S2...
<Kammerjunk> pablez94: I think I have an older version of that picture in wallpaper size.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> I joined this crazy trail waaaay too late.
<Kammerjunk> As in, S1 old.
<Kandarihu> I found his drawing process of that picture yesterday to be quite enlightening.
<pablez94> Kammerjunk: lcick on it u'll discover that is on wallpaper size
<CloverMuffins> that's a lotta ponies :)
<Meanwhile> I return, a second chance to carve your skulls.
<Kammerjunk> pablez94: Well, it's 3347x2284.
<pablez94> CloverMuffins: better?
*Randomnerd sees the poster "GLORY!"
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> And you're welcome to it, Meanwhile.
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> Meanwhile: Hey
<Kammerjunk> I meant as in 1080x1600 or, as I have it, 1200x1920.
<Schocke> hey everyone i see wrex is drawing!:)
<pablez94> Kammerjunk: well i guess it's a WALLpaper size...
<Spectrum_Rush> meanwhile Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Mfw people still spell Wrek's name wrong.
<Kammerjunk> Do ho ho.
<CloverMuffins> pablez94: I always feel better when I look at ponies, yes. but after that I get depressed that I'm not there xd
<Kammerjunk> "Wrex is drawing" I don't really think Wrex would be the artistic type.
*AusBrony is amused
*Kammerjunk is tired.
<Meanwhile> Wrex. "Not now Shepard I'm painting"
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Shephard.
<Kammerjunk> Wrex.
<Randomnerd> Wreck?
<Meanwhile> Spongebob.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Patrick,
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek
<Kammerjunk> Fluttershy.
<Randomnerd> Three yaks and a dog?
<pablez94> CloverMuffins: me too:) then i think taht if i'll be there i probably miss all da human people i know...
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARTA
<Kandarihu> Well, he is. There it is, right there. And he'll probably be making it as nice as that one he did yesterday.
<Randomnerd> No, Thrackarzog!
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> CloverMuffins: Just keep smiling, and believe that you will start a new life in Equestria as a pony one day. :D
<Kammerjunk> What the hay just happened to the chat.
<Meanwhile> Not sure, but it was amusing.
<Kammerjunk> It just spontaneously went oatmeal.
<Spectrum_Rush> Parthuraxx
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Spike
<Randomnerd> Oatmeal? Are you CRAZY?
<Meanwhile> Odahviing.
<CloverMuffins> pablez94: well, that is a point. but if I had an option to go there I wouldn't hesitate one second.
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> Randomnerd: She is...
<Spectrum_Rush> Alduin
<pablez94> am i entertaining u bronies? wanna see more pictures? brohhof me if u want to!
<CloverMuffins> _xXiaoDrag0n_: I believe :)
<Randomnerd> Are you not ENTERTAINED?
<Kammerjunk> )\ amidoingitrite
<Meanwhile> No sir I am not. I want my money back.
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: /(
<pablez94> CloverMuffins: hahaha well maybe i would think about it for smthing like 510 seconds then i'll jump into equestria..
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: I can't help but see a guy kicking something.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> I want my all my monies back.
<pablez94> CloverMuffins: 5/10
*Randomnerd would got to Equestria.
<Meanwhile> )\ ~o
<Randomnerd> go*
*Kammerjunk would sell his soul to go to Equestria.
<Spectrum_Rush> http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/are-you-not-entertained-ridiculously-photogenic-guy.jpg
<Randomnerd> Dat picture.
<Randomnerd> Yes, yes I am.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> I would enjoy a fic where Equestria gets corrupted by our Human nature because we wished ourselves into it.
<Randomnerd> Ninjazz|SPAZ: I would cry for days.
<Spectrum_Rush> hah my pic was on the stream
<Kammerjunk> Spectrum: I should really see that film again.
<Spectrum_Rush> Sucess
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> T'would be quite a tale.
<Spectrum_Rush> Gladiator yeah
<CloverMuffins> pablez94: well, maybe I'd take some time to leave a note to my loved ones that I love them very much and I will miss them :P
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz|SPAZ: Been there, done that.
<Randomnerd> I still need to read "My Little Human"
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Do ho ho ho
<PrincessDismo> :3
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz|SPAZ: I mean, there IS a fic for it, but it's on permanent hiatus.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Name of such fic?
<pablez94> CloverMuffins: that's what i was saying...i'll probably miss them after 2 weeks or something like...
<Meanwhile> So, drawing more Twilight or?
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> Ninjazz|SPAZ: I will hate humanity if that comes true
<Wrek> 05and yes, this is in fact, techno done right
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz|SPAZ: Hold on, I have it SOMEWHERE around here.
<Wrek> 05fuckign wubstep
<Octavias_Pride> ^
<PrincessDismo> Wrek: ;w; You're so fucking awesine at drawing
<Randomnerd> Wrek: There's a time and place for Dubstep
<Randomnerd> ...It's just a sometimes thing, like cookies.
<PrincessDismo> awesome*
<pablez94> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/173068
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> _xXiaoDrag0n_: Well considering that alot of ponies have rather human personalities... It might not be too dramatic as I am obviously thinking.
<Randomnerd> lol dat changeling.
<CloverMuffins> pablez94: I'd probably miss them too, but I surely wouldn't come back ^^ well, at least permanently. I'd maybe make a quick visit and instantly return to ponies ;D
<Spectrum_Rush> pablez94: that changeling's name is Do Me/Doomie
<Randomnerd> Doom doom de doom
<That_British_Guy> God Save the Queen!
<pablez94> Spectrum: nice try
<pablez94> MORE NAMES FOR DA CHANGELING!!1
<Randomnerd> That_British_Guy: You would! /Ammurrica
<Spectrum_Rush> pablez94 it says so right in the tags name courtesy of Glord
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> Randomnerd: I love Pinkie Pie in that scene, she was still so hype, cheerful, happy, carefree when they we fighting the changelings
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> when they were*
<Meanwhile> Pinkie Pie is best pony.
<Randomnerd> Pinkie Pie is pretty hard to faze.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> I like Pinkie Pie.
<pablez94> CloverMuffins: obviously u can't o awlays in equestria or always in da earth what's your choise?
<Twi_Fi> I know how to faze Pinkie Pie.
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> Meanwhile: Mane Six is best pony :D
<Phase4> i;m off to bed, night
<pablez94> Spectrum: notags mentioning doomie...
<Spectrum_Rush> i'm sensing another pony in Wrek's pick
*Randomnerd <3 Ponies too much.
<Meanwhile> G'night Phase4
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> Twi_Fi: How?
<Randomnerd> Bye, Phase4
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> bye bye...
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Gnight Phase4
<CloverMuffins> pablez94: always in equestria then. no contest.
<CloverMuffins> nite Phase4
<Randomnerd> Well, that's not true. There IS a way to <3 Ponies too much.
<pablez94> Spectrum_Rush: notags mentioning doomie...
<Krakass> + means addition Chrysalis
<Octavias_Pride> Wrek......im gonna guess OctaScratch drawing?
<Twi_Fi> By telling her that nopony likes her parties and wants to be her friend anymore.
<Krakass> Hope that answered your question.
<Twi_Fi> Seem to do the trick last time when she assumed it.
<Randomnerd> pablez94: "Requests"
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz|SPAZ: So apparently, I read it before I started archiving everything I read. And I don't really have anything like that not on permanent hiatus.
<Spectrum_Rush> pablez94:last tag man name doomie the whole point of that thread was to make a name and that was the most liked
<Spectrum_Rush> pablez94
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Its fine, Kammerjunk.
<Meanwhile> Woah woah woah. What is this pose?
<Spectrum_Rush> umm
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> I dunno but Sumica said it was ganna be awesome.
*Randomnerd looks at stream. "Damn my dirty mind".
<Meanwhile> Sumica lives in Vegas and is therefore constantly high on showgirl fumes, everything is awesome from that point of view.
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica's words "sexy is awesome"
<CloverMuffins> looks like a dancing pose to me...
<Randomnerd> Sumica lives in VEGAS?
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Well conisdering other things Wrek has drawn, I won't be surprised if it turns out sexy.
<Randomnerd> Or Nevada.
<Meanwhile> Veags.
<Meanwhile> Vegas*
<pablez94> Spectrum_Rush: evidently i am getting stupid. nothing else to say... iwas looking favorited by instead of tag hystory... please punch me
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> I live in Singapore, it's kind off a boring place to live in for me...
<Spectrum_Rush> pablez94; its ok no need for that
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> There's no place to go for an adventure, buildings are everywhere in Singapore...
<pablez94> Spectrum_Rush: PUNCH MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Chrysalis> unfortunately not
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Pawnch.
<Spectrum_Rush> pablez94: ok fine
<Chrysalis> my IRC doesnt support the symbols in use atm
<Randomnerd> Ponies know no flag.
*Spectrum_Rush pawnches pablez94
<Chrysalis> i think anyway
<Chrysalis> lets chek
<Chrysalis> check*
<Randomnerd> I can't let you do that, Starfox!
*Chrysalis is currently working on I ?'' = R × T
<Chrysalis> so it replaced theta with a ? and both R and T lost their accent
*pablez94 spill some blood from mouth and says"is that all u got Spectrum_Rush ?
<Spectrum_Rush> i'm calling it either rariy or trixie
*Ninjazz|SPAZ just got reminded of Fight Club
<CloverMuffins> I love how all pony towns are just for orientation, not implying conquering of any sort
<Spectrum_Rush> pablez94: oh you wanna do this the hard way we'll do this the hard way
<Meanwhile> Can't see the cutie mark accurately enough to figure it out.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> I'm not sure Wrel would draw Rarity.
<Randomnerd> Atatatatattatatata!
<Twi_Fi> Well I must be going.Cya all.

<Randomnerd> We were raised Catholic, strippers aren't our thing :(
<Xanbreon> tiptiptiptip
<Kammerjunk> I was raised as atheist as they come, strippers aren't my thing either.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Well, this is Sumica... He lives in Vegas... See where I am going with this?
*pablez94 "stop now you're hurting me:'( please stooooop" cracks his back "ahhhhhrgh stop it please!!!!" -CRACK- "....."
*Kandarihu brohoofs Randomnerd /)
<Randomnerd> Brohoofs Kandarihu /)
<Kammerjunk> pablez94: Did you break your spine or something? Because no matter where, that's bad.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> But I am interested to see who this mystery pony turns out to be.
<Randomnerd> Kammerjunk: Yeah, it's actually kinda pointless.
<Kammerjunk> That it is.
<Meanwhile> I bet Vegas smells like sex and circus food.
<Kammerjunk> I bet Vegas smells like Vegas.
<Meanwhile> That's what I said.
<pablez94> why u did this Spectrum_Rush ?!?:'(
<pyrocatboy> hello everypony
<RustyMeat> oh jesus what am i looking at
<Kammerjunk> Good point.
<Meanwhile> Allo pyrocatboy.
<CloverMuffins> hi pyrocatboy
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> pyrocatboy, welcome.
<Kammerjunk> RustyMeat: Well, remember that bachelor party Spike was supposed to arrange?
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> I been to Vegas.
<RustyMeat> oh
<Meanwhile> What would the cutie mark of someone whose talent was stripping even look like
<Randomnerd> RustyMeat: I was willing to pretend it was two ponies dancing ballet, but then I unpaused the stream to check on its progress.
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz|SPAZ: Was you a man on the move and just sick enough to be totally confident?
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> A pole.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: A pol-
<Kammerjunk> goddammit
<pyrocatboy> Is that Trixie?
<RustyMeat> Lol
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> :D
<Kammerjunk> Were you*
<Spectrum_Rush> pablez94: oh i'm sorry :'(
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Kammerjunk: No... I was visiting family with my parents.
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz|SPAZ: Oh. But was your heart filled with joy?
<Randomnerd> Strippers would probably cover their cutie marks with a fake one that matches their stage name.
<Litwick> Who's the male pony supposed to be?
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Hmmm Nah.
<Kammerjunk> And did you feel like a monster reincarnation of Horatio Alger?
<Kammerjunk> Well, gosh darn it, then.
*Spectrum_Rush performs healing spell on pablez94
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> What was I supposed to feel? I was around 14.
<Resonantwaves> Hello everypony :D
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Resonantwaves, welcome.
<SilverSonic|Android> Siiigh
<CloverMuffins> hello Resonantwaves
<Randomnerd> There must be ponies good at careers we don't see in the show.
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz|SPAZ: You were supposed to be filled with joy. After all, there was no point in looking back.
<Espeon> 06oo
*pablez94 opens his eyes immediatly and says to Spectrum_Rush "i fooled u!"
<Vordox> This reminds of Trixie and Shining Armor Bachelor Party image. <<.
*pablez94 kicks and punchs and beats Spectrum_Rush
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> I came back to my tiny little island in a round a week's time.
*eXAKR gives Espeon pills
<Randomnerd> I mean, Shining Armor has a shield Cutie Mark, so there's obviously ponies talented at soldiering.
<eXAKR> Ohai Xeli
<Randomnerd> (Dat antiquated verb)
<Espeon> 06hii
<Spectrum_Rush> :'( you
<Kammerjunk> ...It's a reference to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, awright?
*pablez94 keeps fighting till chenges Spectrum_Rush faces..
<SilverSonic|Android> What a horrible day ive had so far
<SilverSonic|Android> I cried today
<eXAKR> I have been training the Espeon named after you on my Pokémon Black
<Spectrum_Rush> :[how dare you pablez94
*eXAKR gives SilverSonic a vial of Phoenix tears
<CloverMuffins> Randomnerd: I'd rather say it's more about protecting in general, rather than... soldiering xd
*pablez94 then stops the allucinating spell
*Meanwhile bangs Spectrum_Rush and pablez94's heads together. "Stop that."
*Spectrum_Rush goes in to a blind rage at pablez94
<Randomnerd> I wonder if there are ponies talented at crimes.
*Vordox grabs Pablez94 and Spectrum_rush on their collar and suspens them in air.
<Kammerjunk> I wonder if there ARE ponies talented at arguing.
<CloverMuffins> stop fighting everypony! :(
<Randomnerd> Or the point is they aren't neccessarily their carreers.
*Spectrum_Rush hey lemme go i gotta bash is face in
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: Lawyer ponies.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> A jewel thief pony is inevitable.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: OBJECTION!
<pablez94> Vordox: don't stop this it was an hallucination..
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: overruled.
<Kammerjunk> ohokay
<SilverSonic|Android> i feel so overwhelmed by everything lately
<Randomnerd> Like, a pony with a crowbar cutie mark might be a burglar, or a Demolitions expert.
<Vordox> Even if it's an illusion, other may not agree to it. Especially for people seeing you two fighting within Bronystates Area.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> No... That would be Gordon Freeman as a pony,
<Kammerjunk> Randomnerd: A demolitions expert has to have an eyepatch. It's almost a requirement.
<Vordox> The new ones particulary.
<owlicious> so, a drawing of Shining Armor and trixie?
<Randomnerd> Any pony truly talented at CRIME would have a totally misleading Cutie Mark.
<Meanwhile> Tbh, how would you ever catch a thief whose special talent is stealing? They'd be so good at it you'd never find them.
*Spectrum_Rush huh what happened
*Vordox puts down the two and bonks their heads with his hoof* Behave now.
*pablez94 stops da hallucinating spell on Vordox Meanwhile and Spectrum_Rush
<SilverSonic|Android> I feel so much regret right now...all these flashbacks to the past mistakes ive made
<Randomnerd> Meanwhile: Exactly. Their CM would be something else entirely.
<Vordox> @.@
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Like a diamond...
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: What if a person whose talent is being a detective tries to catch a person whose talent is not being caught?
<Meanwhile> Just arrest anyone with a suspicious cutie mark.
<Randomnerd> "Officer, I have no idea what you're talking about, I'm just a baker."
<Meanwhile> That'd be like that movie with the psychic law enforcement wouldn't it
<owlicious> Like scootaloo? Orange is a suspicious talent
<Randomnerd> "Suspect is Pink, with a pink mane"
*Spectrum_Rush what'd i do so confuse:(
<Kammerjunk> >psychic law enforcement
<Kammerjunk> wat
<Meanwhile> Someone should write that fic. Where certain cutie marks are considered dangerous to society and are locked away. Presumably under Canterlot.
*pablez94 "i'm pretty powerfull huh Vordox ?"
<Randomnerd> Pinkie Pie truly *was* the master Cake Ruiner...
<owlicious> not the moon?
<Meanwhile> Too much effort.
<Kammerjunk> Oh yes, this song.
*Vordox gives the glare to Pablez.
<Randomnerd> Meanwhile: There's one called "Cognitive Dissonance", It's about a pony who's good at fighting.
<Espeon> 06! @ Exakr
<Espeon> 06yay espeons :3. and o.o
<owlicious> Okay, so are special talents like giving special talents dangerous?
<Viri> 14hi
<Kammerjunk> I am playing the game. The one that'll take me to the end.
<owlicious> what about decreasing entropy
<Meanwhile> The game.
<Meanwhile> You lost it.
<Saturn> 08,01friends!
<Saturn> 08,01romans!
<owlicious> well, it's been a while
<Ninjazz> Friend!
<Kammerjunk> Joke's on you, I lost it 5 minutes ago.
<Meanwhile> Saturn! The game.
<Spectrum_Rush> daMMIT
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: When in Rome?
<owlicious> Scottish molestia!
*pablez94 "whcih sense of "glare" Vordox ?"says scared
<LunaTheBeloved> Good morning everypony :)
<Kammerjunk> When in Rome, do as Roman does.
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: you're meant to say (countrymen)
<Saturn> 08,01then i say
<Randomnerd> I lost interest though. Besides, The Finale already established Ponies can be good soldiers without destroying Equestrian Society.
<Kammerjunk> E.G., go bowling.
<Ninjazz> Dat Julius Caesar
<Saturn> 08,01i know that!
<Meanwhile> Close enough.
<Randomnerd> Most Armies insist their goal is to end the fighting as quickly as possible, in line with Sun Tzu's instructions on the matter.
*pablez94 " Vordox ?" says even MORE scared
<That_British_Guy> did Wrek give up his last drawing???? :(
<Saturn> 08,01i'm totally voting Carry On Caesar this week
<Saturn> 08,01http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPEXCpDIrYM
<pablez94> btw what do ya think about my spell powers Spectrum_Rush? pretty ggod huh that hallucinating spell was pretty hard to learn...
<Kammerjunk> If I don't get into HTX, I'm joining the goddamn Army.
<Meanwhile> try not to get shot Kammerjunk.
<Kammerjunk> I'll try.
<Randomnerd> Kammerjunk: I thought Denmark had compulsory service.
<Kammerjunk> Randomnerd: We do, but only to learn how they do stuff.
<SilverSonic|Android> Ive had this stuck in my head..all day. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZK4ACg3gI8
<SilverSonic|Android> This eases my pain...not by enough though

<Randomnerd> I've been considering joining the Navy for some time.
<pablez94> can somepony hear me?? Vordox ??? Spectrum_Rush ?? is there anypony here?
<Vordox> Omg...The Swedish Translation sucks except for 1 voice. ._. I DECLARE fandubbing time!

<That_British_Guy> So....you drew a Nazi?
<Wrek> 05thats vinyl wieldign a maser, which basicalyl is a fusion driven bass gun
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah. Obviou
<Kammerjunk> Obviously*
<pyrocatboy> MAH BASS CANNON!
<Randomnerd> The problem is that the US Military is treated as the Employer of Last Resort in the US.
<Ninjazz> Make sure to make her eyes magenta, Wrek.
<Meanwhile> Vinyl would be a badass Noise Marine.
<Spectrum_Rush> you played with my mind made me do things pablez94
<VinylScratch> vinyl vinyl vinyl
<Kammerjunk> Randomnerd: Maybe that's because people don't want to die.
<RX-78|Sitemaking> blarg
*Spectrum_Rush glares at pablez94
<LunaTheBeloved> Blorg
<Ninjazz> We are amplified.
<prince-dari> Mmm, dying doesn't seem like fun.
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, dari.
<Meanwhile> Grabl.
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: it is
<Ninjazz> whoa
<prince-dari> Ohai
<Randomnerd> Kammerjunk: lol that's true.
<Meanwhile> Amidoinitrite?
<Saturn> 08,01the actual death part isn't, though
<RX-78|Sitemaking> Yes
<SilverSonic|Android> To be honest...atm it feels like im all alone in this world...
<SilverSonic|Android> So dark and cold
<LunaTheBeloved> Gorbl
<Meanwhile> yay.
<That_British_Guy> Hi prince-dari *bows*
<Ninjazz> Havent seen this color yet.
<RX-78|Sitemaking> Gorgelsmorgel
<Kammerjunk> I wonder if you go to Equestria after death.
*pablez94 "hehehehehehehe "embaraced"wel atleast no pony hurts right Spectrum_Rush ?"
<Ninjazz> prince-dari, welcome.
<LunaTheBeloved> Marglegargle
<Meanwhile> Allo dari.
<Viri> 14o.o
<Meanwhile> Ibblebibble.
<Viri> 14what happened?
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello dari
<Wrek> 05nope after death you cease to exist
<Kammerjunk> Randomnerd: Also, the whole psychologically-scarred part doesn't sound like fun either.
<prince-dari> Tally-ho? :P
<RX-78|Sitemaking> http://dash.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/133535845911.png
<Spectrum_Rush> prince-dari: my league
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: Yeah, figures.
<SilverSonic|Android> Ive made too many mistakes in my life
<LunaTheBeloved> D'aww
*pablez94 ":( sorry Spectrum_Rush."
<SpikeyWikey> Did Wrek finish the twilight pic?
<That_British_Guy> So Wrek whats next?
<Saturn> 08,01my god, i have such a crush on Kenneth Williams
<SilverSonic|Android> some of them....hurt the one person who i truly love.
<Saturn> 08,01i wish i had a time machine
<Randomnerd> Kammerjunk: That has more to do with the irresponsible way our politicians use military force, if you ask me.
<RX-78|Sitemaking> http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/109/d/b/muffin_kinesis_by_captainbritish-d4wodtz.jpg
<Kammerjunk> My God, I have such a cross on Braeburn.
<Spectrum_Rush> do yo ureally ean it pablez94
<Kammerjunk> crush
<Kammerjunk> *
<SilverSonic|Android> I have so much regret inside atm.
<LunaTheBeloved> Heheh
<Ninjazz> cross works... Kinda...
*Spectrum_Rush pinkie pie swear pablez94
<Meanwhile> Ice cream magic.
<RX-78|Sitemaking> And then pinkie pie had control over all baked goods
<Randomnerd> I'm not a pacifist, but our presidents tend to ignore "The Art of War" in a lot of ways.
<LunaTheBeloved> As if she didn't all ready
<Meanwhile> And that's how Equestria was destroyed.
<Kammerjunk> Randomnerd: Well, if fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must FIGHT!
<Randomnerd> ie: Protracted wars are a bad idea.
<That_British_Guy> "The enemy of my enemy is my friend" - Sun Tzu
<Kammerjunk> What if I don't really have any enemies?
<Randomnerd> I don't think Sun Tzu said that...
<That_British_Guy> he did
*Spectrum_Rush funny how were talikng about the art of war considering a few moments ago...
<RX-78|Sitemaking> She currently only has indirect control of all baked goods
<That_British_Guy> TF2 YAY!
<Kammerjunk> Randomnerd: Sun Tzu said that! And I'd say he knows a little more about fighting than YOU do, pal, because HE INVENTED IT!
<SpikeyWikey> So? Did he finish Twi?
<Randomnerd> lol, Kammerjunk.
<Meanwhile> And then he perfected it so that no living man could best him in the ring of honour Kammerjunk.
*pablez94 "no fake this time, i'm serious Spectrum_Rush . i hate to be gleared.. maes me feel pretty bad.. i thought u would be suprised but not that upset."reads to new meassages.."oh yeah i pinkie promise"
<BoilingPiglet> "fighting in facebook won't solve anything" - sun tzu
<Ninjazz> Did somebody say Zoo?
<Meanwhile> Then he used his fight money to buy two of every animal on earth! Then he herded them onto a boat! and then he beat the crap out of every single one!
<Viri> 14o.o
<Kammerjunk> Fighting on the Internet in general won't solve anything.
<Spectrum_Rush> pablez94: oh kay then apoligie excepted
<Meanwhile> And from that day forward any time a bunch of animals are together in one place it's called a zoo!
<Meanwhile> ...
<Meanwhile> Unless it's a farm!
<Kammerjunk> Fighting -for- the Internet, however, is different.
<LunaTheBeloved> Meanwhile, that explains so much....
<SilverSonic|Android> Sigh
<That_British_Guy> Cant wait to see what he has.....
<Meanwhile> He has a machina.
<Gilbert> yay i officially have my drivers liscense back!
<Meanwhile> Which is silly because you can't no scope with a machina.

<Ninjazz> Such a good person.
<Onyxia> saturn i wanna learn how to draw too
<Cobellanez> I just need to be able to accept my art work
<Cobellanez> I think everything I draw is crap
*pablez94 "yeah... this doesn't make me a filly..." -amused face- Spectrum_Rush
<Cobellanez> So I don't draw
<Cobellanez> And I don't get any better :s

<Ninjazz> Go fix that.
<Ninjazz> Add Wrek and go play with him.
*Spectrum_Rush laughs
<SilverSonic|Android> And AE..My pain im feeling right now...was caused by me...and all the past mistakes ive made...
<CloverMuffins> Ninjazz: Nyria was talking to me when I was at really dark places and she helped me to get out. She really lives up to identifying herself with Pinkie Pie ;) and I miss talking to her
<Ninjazz> CloverMuffins: She really does... God damn I miss her.
*pablez94 "better. Spectrum_Rush " laughs thinking that's an human and not an horse but acts like he is
<Angel_Espeon> 13Everyone makes mistakes, it's part of life
<Xanbreon> Lifes a <censored>
<Ninjazz> At first I was a little put off by just how freakin friendly she was... I was foolish. So foolish.
<L[a]korv> bad xan.
<L[a]korv> I mean hi.
<Xanbreon> I stand by my point
<Meanwhile> Nyria isn't a she.
<Xanbreon> hey L[a]korv
<Xanbreon> :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13There'll be plenty of opportunities to pick yourself up again, I promise
<Ninjazz> He.
<Spectrum_Rush> pablez94: uh wut
<SilverSonic|Android> I hope so AE
<Angel_Espeon> 13and you shouldn't dwell over things that have happened in the past, instead you should focus on what's to come
<Ninjazz> Hard to find guys that friendly.
<L[a]korv> if I were to actually care for all my mistakes I'd have killed myself years ago.
<Angel_Espeon> 13hope you feel better soon though~ and I'm always here if you need someone to talk to :3
<Meanwhile> And ffs, first the display driver goes out, now it's telling me only one instance of the game can be running. Fuck you computer.
*pablez94 "nothing. what?" Spectrum_Rush
<Xanbreon> +1@ L[a]korv
<Ninjazz> I knowz that feel, Meanwhile.

<Viri> 14oh well
<Spectrum_Rush> hey That_British_Guy
*Viri updates 3DS
<Angel_Espeon> 13When I think about just how many people here have gone through depression or other incredibly difficult times in life, I suddenly feel really grateful that I've never felt that low myself before o.o;
<Ninjazz> What is it that you must know?
<That_British_Guy> and that would be NewDCD?
<Saturn> 08,01NewDCD: yes, i admit it, i slept with her.
<That_British_Guy> O_O

<pablez94> pablez94's silly question time!!!! where are u from That_British_Guy ?
<NewDCD> 09,01anybody here own Ace Combat: Assault Horizon?
<Viri> 14you are very lucky, or you have a very strong personality o.o
<NewDCD> 09,01I need to know if it's worth it, from the perspective of an AC Vet
<That_British_Guy> I wish i own it :(
<That_British_Guy> but i have played the demo
<That_British_Guy> and in my opinion
<Angel_Espeon> 13Eh, I'm not that strong |D
<pablez94> NewDCD: i don't and i don't know what is it
<That_British_Guy> TOTALLY WORTH BUYING!
<Dark_Horst> just went to eqd while the stream was on. it's amazing how the music fits http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/04/nightly-roundup-300-this-is-full-of.html
<NewDCD> 09,01I don't know
<Angel_Espeon> 13when I think about the times that have got me stressed out for longer periods of time and such, they're nowhere near as bad as what other people here have had .w.
<NewDCD> 09,01Dogfight Mode sounds terribul
<Dark_Horst> well, fitted. the moment's over -.-
<NewDCD> 09,01and
<NewDCD> 09,01>regenerating health
<Ninjazz> I actually heard people say its not good. Other than that I can't offer you anything else.
<NewDCD> 09,01why why would you do that in an AC game
<That_British_Guy> NewDCD it got 8.75 outa 10
<Randomnerd> Augh, an Uber wasted! :(
<NewDCD> 09,01in IGN?
<NewDCD> 09,01Pfhahahaha
<Ninjazz> MW in AC.
<NewDCD> 09,01as if IGN's opinion was worth something
*Spectrum_Rush SUNSHINE SUNSHINE LADYBUG AWAKE CLAP YOUR HOOVES AND DO AL LITTLE SHAKE
<Dark_Horst> NewDCD: they said they wanted to reinvent assault horizon
<That_British_Guy> nope.avi
<Angel_Espeon> 13then again, even when I am stressy about something I tend to try not to show it xD
<That_British_Guy> GameInformer
*Spectrum_Rush yawns
<NewDCD> 09,01but theres a demo, then?
<Xanbreon> As i said, lifes a biatch
<Dark_Horst> NewDCD: in clear english: make it cod-kiddie freindly
<NewDCD> 09,01I think I'll try that
<Viri> 14well, at least for me, the past is the past
<NewDCD> 09,01that direction that games are taking makes me sick
<Viri> 14it took me years to overcome depression, but I did it, at least for the most part ^^;
<NewDCD> 09,01on the other hand, Assault Horizon Legacy sounds sweet
<Litwick> What are they going to sing or something?
<NewDCD> 09,01since it's a remake of AC2

<Ninjazz> My god...

<NewDCD> 09,01I hear the Multiplayer is good though
<pavarkian> We watching Wrek again?
<Ninjazz> Dark_Horst: Think Inglorius Bastards only really bad characters.
<Dark_Horst> oh boy
*Spectrum_Rush2 its ok pablez94 noponies perfect
<Ninjazz> Yep...
<pavarkian> but thats what brothers in arms is...
<That_British_Guy> Dark_Horst they took the most dramatic WW2 video game story and turned it into Inglories Bastards the video game
<Ninjazz> Oh HELL NO!
<NewDCD> 09,01well I might get it for Multiplayer (since I like the call backs they did to the Razgriz/Wardog Squadron from AC5 in the promotional materials)
*pablez94 "oh my gos the Spectrum_Rush has been daoubled!!!"
<Dark_Horst> well, if you want games that don't nerf themselves into shit or throw baysplosions and one-liner around, maybe you shoudl take a look at red orchestra
<Ninjazz> Brothers in Arms is a god damn good story of a squad leader and his troops trek through hell.
<pavarkian> ok
<Dark_Horst> the gameplay aims for realism and it's supposedly tough as fuck
*Spectrum_Rush2 MUHAHAHAHAHA
<pavarkian> I really dont give a fuk
<pavarkian> *fuck
<That_British_Guy> Dark_Horst then you wouldnt want to play ARMA 2 then

<Kammerjunk> Krakass: Figures.
<Invi> Wrek throw a coin

<thisguy> and some men just want to watch the world load
<Wrek> 05and to not go over that
<Wrek> 05they addd patches afterwards
<Rainbow--Dash> Wrek not to be rude but that colt has a female figure
<Pinkies4thWall> SEXY COLT
<thisguy> waht rainbow said
<RainbowAsh> Wrek: So it can't download games above a certain size, but it can patch it to a bigger size afterwards? That doesn't sound like a well thought out system either
<Wrek> 05implying thats not the point
<CloverMuffins> bbl. love you all :)

<SilverSonic|Android> Jolteon*
<StoryLine> Thanks. Now to use it to learn how to draw dem ponies
<pyrocatboy> Kammerjunk: Hooker pony is best pony.

<Rainbow--Dash> pyrocatboy whats with you
<Dken2021> pyrocatboy a pony with hooks?

<Kammerjunk> Dken2021: Good Goddesses, thank you.
<SilverSonic|Android> She hasnt been here in over a year
<Rainbow--Dash> alexxm? what? but derpy is my best freind D:
<Soital> 12whut seriously?
<Rainbow--Dash> :o
<Soital> 12where she's gone
<pyrocatboy> Kammerjunk: -_- Its a joke.
<thisguy> would be better with top hat
<SilverSonic|Android> Shes on skype often...havent said hi to her in forever tho
<Kammerjunk> pyrocatboy: Yeah?
<alexxm> i didn't mean you spefically Rainbow--Dash just the title of the picture
<SilverSonic|Android> But she drew me this http://pro.charex.net/main/pictures/PR_153.png
<Rainbow--Dash> oh :P
<StoryLine> Derpy is like "dude What the flank?"
<alexxm> sorry Rainbow--Dash
<Rainbow--Dash> StoryLine taht makes no sence at all
<Rainbow--Dash> thats like saying "WHAT THE @$$"
<StoryLine> the pic
<ctcb> Am I the only person to see the HUGE plot error in the show?
<thisguy> is your background sexy twilight?
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Soital> 12thats pretty cool
<SilverSonic|Android> That pic kinda shows how ive been feeling for awhile
<alexxm> what is it ctcb
<Rainbow--Dash> thisguy acctualy his background changes :P
<StoryLine> can't use the proper f word in chat
<thisguy> thats cool
*DrGNs I like having hurt, so send the pain below where I need it
<Kammerjunk> StoryLine: Fire?
<ctcb> alexxm: Season 2, Episode 26… A huge error...
<ctcb> Part of the script doesn't make sense...
<Gun_Dealer_Xephos> ello
<QueenChrysalis> what error would that be?
<Kammerjunk> ctcb: Do elaborate.
<Rainbow--Dash> ctcb ikr XD
<thisguy> what part?
<Dken2021> ello Gun_Dealer_Xephos
<Rainbow--Dash> GUYS I KNOW TOO
<StoryLine> not just fire SpitFire
<alexxm> hey Gun_Dealer_Xephos hows your day been
<Gun_Dealer_Xephos> gud
<DrGNs> I have a feeling they could have done a better introduction with Chrysalis
<RainbowAsh> Rainbow--Dash, ctcb, are you going to fill the rest of us in, too, please?
<owlicious> and dead
<SilverSonic|Android> So yeah
<ctcb> QueenChrysalis: Season 2 episode 1, Celestia clearly states only her horn and magic can open the vault containing the elements, In episode 26, she asks the mane6 to go get the elements of harmony on their own without her...
<ctcb> RainbowAsh: ^^
<thisguy> iif rainbow dash makes sonic rainboom at the bigest wedin in canterlot how do the wonderbolts not find her as a good flyer?
<QueenChrysalis> ohh I never thought of that..
<QueenChrysalis> but I thought twilight kept the elements in her book?
<Kammerjunk> ctcb: Weren't they getting married in the throne room, where the Elements were kept in the beginning of S2?
<Kammerjunk> The way I see it, they were moved afterwards.
<DrGNs> If she's the only one to do a sonic rainboom is more of a confusing reason why she is not yet a wonderbol
<Soital> 12it'll definately get better, probably won't feel like it will now but trust yourself =)
<Rainbow--Dash> EVERYPONY The plot error is that if they made a changeling defence sheild then how could she get in? dont say its because she took someones form because that would imply that every cahngling could get in easilly...
<alexxm> discord did that QueenChrysalis
<ctcb> Kammerjunk: They went back to the same room used in S2E1
<pyrocatboy> Rainbow--Dash: She was already there.
<RainbowAsh> ctcb: After discord had been able to steal the elements easily in episode 1 it seems reasonable to assume that the security measures have been overhauled since then. At that point Twilight or all of the mane6 might have gotten access to the elements as well.
<alexxm> perhaps she got in before they found out Rainbow--Dash
<DrGNs> Rainbow--Dash: Maybe she was there before the sheild was placed
<StoryLine> She used the plot device
<Kammerjunk> ctcb: They didn't actually get the Elements, though, did they?
<Rainbow--Dash> Nope
<Kammerjunk> Didn't Cadence do it?
<Rainbow--Dash> no
<Rainbow--Dash> They dont use elements at all
<Kammerjunk> Well, her and Shining Armor. With the power of LOVE.
<DrGNs> Love was the victor I guess
<ctcb> Kammerjunk: No, they were stopped before they could...
<SilverSonic|Android> I hope so
<Litwick> Drat! I've been beaten by the pwoer of looooooooove!
<Rainbow--Dash> Kammerjunk actually they just touched horns she dispenced her magic into his magic acctualy had nothing to do with it XD
<Rainbow--Dash> love*
<Rainbow--Dash> love ahd nothing to do with it XD
<Kammerjunk> Rainbow--Dash: "My love will give you strength."
<Rainbow--Dash> Kammerjunk she just wanted a good quote XD
<QueenChrysalis> I found it interesting that they never actually say in the episode that Cadance is celestia's niece
<Kammerjunk> Rainbow--Dash: But then that means energy transfer is possible through magic. This is excellent!
<That_British_Guy> So is Wrek just drawing random stuff now?
<Kammerjunk> I can use that so much!
<Rainbow--Dash> Kammerjunk EYUP
<DrGNs> If was love that powered Chrysalis in the first part, and what he regained back was Candece's which was just as strong or even stronger than Shining armor's
<DrGNs> *it
<Kammerjunk> Moral: Screw the rules, I have love.
<Rainbow--Dash> DrGNs no they just used cadences power as her being a princess combining with shinings low amount of power created the shield again love had nothing to do with it
<SilverSonic|Android> And atm...ive lost alot of trust in myself
<Kammerjunk> Also, "I told her she wouldn't just be getting a husband. She'd be getting a pretty good sister, too." That totally sounds like a loving relationship.
<DrGNs> If Candece had enough power already wouldn't she be able to stop Chrysalis at the beginning of her escape?
<SilverSonic|Android> I havent able to much at all really
<RX-78|Sitemaking> Dken2021: shizuka posted that in mane chat earlier
<Kammerjunk> DrGNs: If energy transfer is indeed possible, she pooled her energy with Shining Armor.
<Wrek> 05dat Cutie Mark
<SilverSonic|Android> Ive had like no inspiration for anything
<CrimsonPhoenix> Cadence can only spread love
<SilverSonic|Android> I can barely think of a song to make..
<SilverSonic|Android> Then again
<Dken2021> ah, I take it some took it well?
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: That is indeed a fine cutie mark.
<Shizuka> 13ping
<SilverSonic|Android> I dont really have any creativity with my music
<Dken2021> neat cutiemark
<DrGNs> That's right, isn't Cadence's power and magic "love" ?
<CrimsonPhoenix> yes
<Dken2021> allo shizu
<CrimsonPhoenix> She spread that love but that's not an offensive magic
<Randomnerd> The very same thing SA had lost.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bingo
<Rainbow--Dash> DrGNs She didnt but shining did the combined power of cadence AND shinings low power was enough power to create the sheild the shining alone originally could create it cadences power is more so then cadence just helped him perform the spell transfering her energy to his horn her power is "love" thats why she said "my love will save us"
<SilverSonic|Android> Im not really creative at all honestly
<RX-78|Sitemaking> pong
<Randomnerd> Perhaps we're a bit to literal about "Love"?
<SilverSonic|Android> The only thing im remotely good at is just hosting a show with music..thats it.
<Kammerjunk> Randomnerd: You can never be too literal.
<Randomnerd> Maybe Chrysalis was eating his Elan Vital.
<Invi> Ok, I'm out. C y'all later
<Randomnerd> Bye, Invi
<DrGNs> We're talking about the power of love on cartoon ponies at a royal wedding 0_0
<Wrek> 05heck that CM would make a neat tattoo
<Kammerjunk> love (noun): An intense feeling of deep affection: "their love for their country".
<Kammerjunk> love (verb): Feel a deep romantic or sexual attachment to (somepony): "do you love me?".
<Soital> 12dood don't let anyone make you feel like this
*Invi hugs Randomnerd
<Randomnerd> DrGNs: Yes, we're obsessive, I'll not deny it.
<Invi> thanks for streaming Wrek ^^
<Rainbow--Dash> Wrek i thought cuty marks were just tattoos on their buts *antibrony*
<Rainbow--Dash> XD
*Randomnerd hugs Invi back
<Soital> 12its probs hard to see with your mindset now but you have something dood
<Soital> 12=>
<Rainbow--Dash> lol
<Skydroid> Prinny dood
<RainbowAsh> DrGNs, if that surprises you, you must be new ;)
<Soital> 12^ :3
<SilverSonic|Android> Brb
<Rainbow--Dash> not really just being stupid :P
<Skydroid> Etnaaa
<Kammerjunk> DrGNs: This is Equestria. Love = I HAVE THE POWER!
<Viri> 14lol
<Soital> 12Laaharl
<Randomnerd> Love is the Seventh Element?
<Viri> 14I never did anything good until a few time ago
<Rainbow--Dash> Kammerjunk LOVE DID NOTHING D: EXCEPT HELP THE EVIL ONE
<Rainbow--Dash> XD
<Skydroid> Raspberylll
<Viri> 14and I still don't
<Viri> 14:D
<DrGNs> RainbowAsh, I've been a brony for awhile, but after a period of time it becoming a natural thing This may be a thing noticing after XD
<alexxm> hey Randomnerd hows your day been
<Randomnerd> Hey alexxm
<SS> Im preparing for a ping
<Kammerjunk> Rainbow--Dash: That's because she feeds off of it. If Cadence's cutie mark is about love, it certainly helped in the end.
<SS> Brb
<RX-78|Sitemaking> time for me to depart for now
<RainbowAsh> Wait
<Skydroid> !pokemon
<Bygios> Skydroid, you are a 12Teddiursa.
<Dken2021> alll this talk of power of love, confusnig @_@
<Kammerjunk> I am liking this colt.
<Rainbow--Dash> Kammerjunk so cadence is a changling that cant change form XD
<Randomnerd> Love is stronger than deception, that's sure.
<RainbowAsh> If Cadence's power is love, why did Crysalis settle for shining armor and didn't feed of her directly?
<PinkiePry> Who is streaming?
<Kammerjunk> Rainbow--Dash: Except she doesn't feed off of it, she gives it.
<Randomnerd> Chrysalis Still needs to weaken the force field.
<Kammerjunk> RainbowAsh: Because she's the villain. She's legally bound to make stupid decisions.
<NightSeas> 2Hai Skylands
<Rainbow--Dash> XD
<Rainbow--Dash> lol
<RainbowAsh> Kammerjunk, oh, all right, didn't consider that.
<Rainbow--Dash> Kammerjunk i follow you on that one
<Randomnerd> Eating Cadance's love may not have fed her, but that doesn't break the shield.
<PinkiePry> Can somepony tell me hooves streaming?
<Kammerjunk> >hooves streaming
<Kammerjunk> o u
<PinkiePry> :$
<Randomnerd> Had Chrysalis worked over SA long enough, the shield would have collapsed on its own.
<Kammerjunk> Anyhow, it's Wrek.
<PinkiePry> Okai
<PinkiePry> Thanks
<SilverSonic|Android> Back
<Kammerjunk> Bitte.
<Viri> 14wb
<Dken2021> PinkiePry that was so punny my cheese melted
<SilverSonic|Android> Thank
<Randomnerd> TS may have forced her to rush it and have her army start attacking the shield.

<PinkiePry> Dken2021 :$
<Dken2021> ... i'm not sure if that means anything
<Kammerjunk> Dken2021: Yeah, me neither.
<Light_Latias> 12these Nurses are almost as bad as Pyramid Head x.o
<SilverSonic|Android> ?
<Light_Latias> 12Silent Hill 2
<DrGNs> Cadence's power is controlled of her emotions of love, if she does not have pure love inside her, I'm not sure her magic would carry as much power, Through the series they show that all emotions carry on true power. So with Cadences magic having to be powered by her own love, That's what had to drive out all anti-forces opposing the stronger force that overpowers it's strength
<Kammerjunk> What is it with songs and walls?
<Kammerjunk> I am totally remembering everything here and using it.
<SilverSonic|Android> Eh
<SilverSonic|Android> Sigh...cooking today for this class period
<Kammerjunk> Oh, flash crashes. You are so random.
<Kammerjunk> Flash*
<Demonpony> I just realized in equestria you can be naked and no one will say a thing as horses are always naked
<Randomnerd> Cadence creates love, sure, but in theory, her love for SA is as strong has his love for her.
<Skydroid> SH2, oh god
<Light_Latias> 12my first time playing through
<Kammerjunk> Demonpony: Uh, beg'yr pard'n, but we don't normally wear clothes.
<Light_Latias> 12no guides or anything
<Light_Latias> 12and it's kicking my tail
<Demonpony> Exactly :D
<Skydroid> I want my own copy
<RDashie> HI GURLS!
<Randomnerd> So Chrysalis has to choose one, she might as well brainwash the Pony who is the cornerstone of Canterlot's Defense Policy.
<Skydroid> At the same time I don't
<Randomnerd> Though controlling Cadence would provide her with victims by the score.
<Demonpony> Anyone hopping the dopple gangers come back in Season 3? Or osme kind of dark lord
<Skydroid> The game is scary sh*t
<Randomnerd> Demonpony: Oh, hell yeah.
<RDashie> discord
<Randomnerd> I LOVE this unapologetic evil.
<Demonpony> Eh not discord I was thinking more evil
<SilverSonic|Android> *hums toot toot sonic warrior*
<HyperMetalLugia> ewww silent pils
<Demonpony> like a legit dark knight with dark powers :D
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Randomnerd> No more of this Draco in Leather Pants garbage.
<RDashie> yes but this time discord would know wtf to do with his powers
*Light_Latias muzzles Hyper
<Light_Latias> 12oh hush you
<Demonpony> If I was with discord I'd show him what true chaos is none of that silly soap roads and pink clouds
<RDashie> XD
<DrGNs> at least for sure, It's know that Discord will reappear in something of season 3
<Light_Latias> 12and agreed, Sky
<Demonpony> I'd show true horros :3
<DrGNs> *known
<NightSeas> 2How are you today Skylands?
<Light_Latias> 12it's terrifying .-.
<Randomnerd> Chrysalis is EVIL. She's hollowing out an upstanding soldier so her army can conquer an entire Kingdom, starting with its capital.
<RDashie> anypony knows something about S3?
<NightSeas> 2and yes, SH2 is scary ._.
<Randomnerd> RDashie: "Sweet Myster of Life", my friend.
<Demonpony> No one knows season 3 RDashie only except it's confirmed
<RDashie> :(
<Demonpony> If I don't know any information then no one does
<SilverSonic|Android> Ive never played the SH series
<RDashie> why? who are u?
<Viri> 14I'd like to play more horror games
<SilverSonic|Android> Brb
<Demonpony> I'm someone who has secret sorces ;3
<Viri> 14but I'm a...how I can say without being rude...mmmmm...
<Demonpony> sources*
<RDashie> ooohhhh
<RDashie> :D
<Light_Latias> 12OMG STAY DOWN
<DrGNs> John said he did more voice recording for discord 3 - 2 months ago
*Light_Latias whews
<Viri> 14let's just say I'm easily scared by those xD
<RainbowAsh> RDashie, it will only have 13 episode McCarthy is going to be in charge and Polsky is going to come back for it probably.
*ACS13123 has just arrived...and is wondering what srawing this is now
<Viri> 14when I played RE4, I was always like "OHGODOHGODNONONONONONO"
<ACS13123> drawing*
<Viri> 14and when there was too much silence, I always shot somewhere to hear sound
<RDashie> only 13 ? :(
<Demonpony> I'm a go to CA
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<Demonpony> have fun everypony :3
<Light_Latias> 12well
<Light_Latias> 12that was scary
<RDashie> bye
<Light_Latias> 12I enter a room...
<RainbowAsh> Bai Demonpony
<Light_Latias> 12...and there's a Nurse with a pipe 3ft away
<Randomnerd> Bye DashWithRainbows
<Randomnerd> Demonpony, rather.
<RDashie> ok im going too.... keep tight ponies :P
<RainbowAsh> RDashie, yes, there have been a few sources for s3 being shorter
<Randomnerd> Sorry DashWith
<DrGNs> wait, so the seasons are going to be shortened down to 12- 13 episodes????
<RainbowAsh> Bai RDashie
<Randomnerd> Bye, RDashie
<RDashie> nye
<RDashie> bye*
<RDashie> XD
<Randomnerd> 13 episodes?! :O
<RainbowAsh> DrGNs, well, we have no idea about any seasons after s3, so it's anyone's guess.
<PrincessDismo> D:
*Randomnerd falls to his knees "NOOOOOOOOOO!"
<Dken2021> 13 known made, there might be some later on
<RainbowAsh> DrGNs, but since MLP is the hub's strongest horse in the stable so to speak, who knows, maybe there is a movie in the works
<Saturn> 08,01Dash. Pinkie takes you do a gay bar. Pinkie takes you to a gay bar.
<Radu> Indeed, Saturn
<Randomnerd> RainbowAsh: I c wut u did thar.
<Randomnerd> "6 seasons and a movie."
<Light_Latias> 12it's the equivalent of turning around a corner in L4D right into a Charger
<That_British_Guy> Oh jesus :D

<Randomnerd> (Community HAS made references to Ponies. "Abed, the Emotionally Unavailable Unicorn"
<WallMaster> good afternoon, all.
<Randomnerd> Hey WallMaster
<DrGNs> I don't see the show with any problems, There's no large complaints from audience, has massive viewings, probably even receives generous donations, It'd seem like a huge thing to fall back away from all that success this early?
<Dken2021> because it's hot?
<Derpy_at_work> dken2021: is pure lead
<Derpy_at_work> its
<Randomnerd> Wow!
<ACS13123> so...many...ponies...EVERYWHERE!
<Randomnerd> Yeah, you might wanna wear gloves whilst handling that.
<Dken2021> indeed
<Radu> Oh my, so many "JOIN THE REA" fanarts
<Randomnerd> What's the "REA"?
<DrGNs> Era?
<RainbowAsh> EPA?
<Dken2021> Royal Equestrian Army?
<Randomnerd> Is this like the Lunar Empire thing?
<Randomnerd> I think there's no Regiment other than the Royal Guards.
<Randomnerd> Canonically.
<Radu> Indeed, Dken2021
<DrGNs> Woah, so much love for Chrysalis!!!
<Randomnerd> My headcanon says Equestria has a navy of Airships, you never see them because it's small and always flying.
<Dken2021> all in a few days too
<DrGNs> I've got it!!!! Ponies, IN SPACE for new episodes!
<ACS13123> ...
<ACS13123> maybe....
<Triple> ..
<Bronysith> DrGNs yes yes yes yYES YES YES YES YES YES YES YEPS YES YES EYS
<Randomnerd> DrGNs: I'm looking forward to Globe-Trotting.
<WallMaster> Mobile Suit Ponies. I'll pass, kthx.
<DrGNs> :d
<Randomnerd> I think they'll go to Zecora's Homeland.
<Triple> how about a bucking portal to equastria
<Randomnerd> I'm still looking for that damn portal.
<Triple> lol
<Triple> maybe we just need to think about it really really hard
<Triple> and than it will apper
<Randomnerd> If I weren't skeptical, I'd attempt lucid dreaming and actually dream of ponies.
<ZombieBrony> Sup bros
<DrGNs> The ponies will travel across the galaxy and universe
<Dken2021> or maybe the portal to equestria is in.... our hearts?
<Bronysith> nope
<Bronysith> its right over there
<Randomnerd> Dken2021: Mmm... nah.
<Triple> WHERE?
*Bronysith points to portal to equestria
<Dken2021> oh well, so much for trying
<Triple> lol
*Bronysith goes through portal
<Triple> wait for me

<Triple> i mean

<Triple> NO i want to do it!
<DrGNs> What'd I'd do to go to sugar cube corner
<Dken2021> Queen Chrysalis kidnapped Princess Cadence, assumed her form and tried to marry Shining Armor to further her goal of invading and draining all the love from Equestria. The fandom's immediate reaction? Adorable fanart. -TvTropes
<Bronysith> OMG THEY HAD THE MMMMMM IT WAS AWESOME

<Triple> she asked me if i was ok
<Triple> and than in just 1 sec
<Triple> i passed out again
<Soital> 12but you're on here during class
<Randomnerd> My CM would be a stack of books.
<Soital> 12qwhich is something I could never do
<Soital> 12;3
<Soital> 12also silent hill ftw
<Randomnerd> But I'm definitely not a Unicorn.
<Kammerjunk> My CM would be absolutely nothing.
<Kammerjunk> I have no talents.
<Randomnerd> I'm not that bright.
<Triple> XD
<Triple> mine will be a keyboerd and a mouse
<Sylandest> howdy, everypony! :)
<Triple> lol
<WallMaster> Hi Sylandest.
<Triple> howdy
<Cobellanez> Hey Slyandest
<Kammerjunk> Salve, Sylandest.
<ehm> Randomnerd, no worries. RD is an egghead, too. ;p
<Rukario> lol Soital
<Randomnerd> Kammerjunk: You're good at putting yourself down
<Rukario> HyperMetalLugia
<pyrocatboy> Triple: Me as well.
<Rukario> i got more DOS worksheets
<Rukario> i'll do them later :P
<Kammerjunk> Randomnerd: Well, what would the cutie mark of someone who degrades himself even look like?
<Randomnerd> You've got a CM, you just haven't found it.
<Nick> mm that was nice curry
<Bronysith> Triple did u see the CMC cutie marks
<Triple> yes.
<Randomnerd> There wouldn't be one -they'd be convinced they'd never get one
<Triple> just kidding i was there for just like a week.
<Triple> D:
<Bronysith> i was there for 30 years i should know
<DrGNs> where?
<Triple> equastria.
<Bronysith> eeeyup
<Bronysith> it was great
<That_British_Guy> http://digitalzebra.deviantart.com/art/Team-Fortress-2-Twilight-Sniper-297913081 Oh god yes......
<Kammerjunk> If I had to guess, though, I'd say an open book. One, I have over 700 books and two, I have nothing to hide.
<DrGNs> You lucky Bastard!
<Randomnerd> lol, I'm such a weirdo. "You'll find your Cutie Mark, someday!" ...you're 15, Kammerjunk, you've got plenty of potential.
<Triple> i was a gray pegsus with a black mane
<Triple> boy it was great to be with fluttershy
<pyrocatboy> -bites one of Triple's ears off-
<ehm> That_British_Guy, christmas lights? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of camouflage?
<WallMaster> I dont has a cutie mark cus I is not a poni.
<Triple> why you did that?
<That_British_Guy> ehm thats what we call fun :3
<Kammerjunk> If I was a pony, I'd probably be a unicorn. It just makes most sense to me
<Sylandest> <--- earth pony over here
<Triple> O_O
<pyrocatboy> Triple: Because I felt like it.
<Bronysith> i was a unicorn when i visited equestria
<Triple> lol
<Randomnerd> I'm probably a Donkey.
<Triple> lets all join in a big brohoof and maybe we will be at equastria
<Triple> *brohoof*
<Bronysith> i think im going back to equestria
<Dken2021> ok, hating audacity now, seems to have a mind of it's own
<Sylandest> *brohoof*
*Bronysith enters portal
<That_British_Guy> nothing happened :l
<Triple> XD
<Kammerjunk> I don't harvest the land and I'm afraid I'd burn down the kitchen if I tried to cook anything. I don't feel the need for speed and while flight would be nice, it's not something I long for.
<That_British_Guy> :|
<Triple> bronysith?
<Bronysith> im back
<Triple> how long
<Triple> ?
<Bronysith> 60 years
<Triple> hahaha
<Triple> wtf?
<Bronysith> yea there was a 30 year war
<Triple> wtf you did there for 60 years
<Bronysith> with the miasma
<Triple> XDDDDDDDDD
<Bronysith> and 30 years of recovery
<Triple> so it means the mane 6 arent alive?
<Bronysith> no they are
<Triple> huh..?
*Sylandest is confused
<Kammerjunk> I don't doubt you could be there for 60 years. Most people assume that time is a strict progression of cause to affect.
<Kammerjunk> But in reality, it's more like a big bowl of wibbly wobbly timey wimey... stuff.
<Triple> JOIN IN A BIG BRO HOOF AND WE WILL BE IN EQUASTRIA
<Triple> *brohoof*

<Radu> ^
<Radu> Indeed
<WallMaster> glennglog22: where have you been in the past decade?
<WallMaster> actually, longer.
<glennglog22> what are you talking about?
<drfsupercenter> 03But now Newell is directly involved with work on the Linux client, says Larabel, and as proof, he offers the picture up top (among others)  a shot of Newells desk setup, running zombie-shooter Left 4 Dead 2 natively on Ubuntu 11.10 with AMD Catalyst Linux drivers. Larabel says Valve is dedicating most of its Linux development time to L4D2 because of the games stable code base.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL

<Cobellanez> Hello SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What? :O
<RainbowAsh> There is one thing that struck me as odd in s2, but I don't know if it is really bad: When the ponies are sad, they are often weeping instead of crying, i.e. tears are flowing but they don't make any sounds that would normally accompany tears. Did anyone else ever notice that?
<alexxm> link please CrimsonFoxx
<RainbowAsh> SuperBrony64, that sounds adorable
<Sylandest> RainbowAsh: I did not see that, you make a good ppoint

<Onyxia> k
<That_British_Guy> Right....
<alexxm> how come OmegaMetroidBrony
<WallMaster> yep.
<Onyxia> was it a joke?
<twilight_sprinkle> User0: last time you just told me "it doesnt work that way", so yeah
<Onyxia> :P
<TheRainbowDash> CriticKitten: How much do you want it?
<Roflbot> YAY FALLOUT
<OmegaMetroidBrony> You'll see alexxm
<TheRainbowDash> Is it like a pet to to you?
<FillyFlam> Alright, sticks taped. Now I can actually pay attention.
<User0> twilight_sprinkle: I was refering to how much control/energy it would take, and the fact that something is plausable doesn't make it feasable
<Onyxia> btw where do u live TheRainbowDash
<Onyxia> i live in Greece
<TheRainbowDash> Onyxia: Batimare.
<pyrocatboy> 6
<CriticKitten> TheRainbowDash: I'm going to be gone pretty much all weekend because of the beta, does that answer your question? :P
<That_British_Guy> http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&q=NewBorn+Rainbow+Dash#/d4ghny2 My pick for round 2!
<Onyxia> ;o
<TheRainbowDash> CriticKitten: I guess so.:P
<twilight_sprinkle> User0: how should i have known what you meant, working "that way" doesnt sound like "too hard to do"
<Roflbot> is Wrek playing
<Jim> I've got that message too CriticKitten, don't despair
<pyrocatboy> yes
<Onyxia> i see
<Sylandest> That_British_Guy: oh celestia, my heart
<That_British_Guy> SuperBrony64...who wins round 2?
<CriticKitten> Jim: It's odd, they said it was ready. Server overload?
<semc> more proof i can't play this game, he's shootting at stuff i can't even see
<Jim> Probably, my brother managed to install it though
<Chrysalis> RX-78-SweetieBot any word on ME3 tonight?
<TheRainbowDash> That_British_Guy: I would automatically because I'm in your picture.:D
<That_British_Guy> XD
<Sylandest> lol

<That_British_Guy> SuperBrony64?????
<semc> i remember my first and only attempt at playing Fallout3
<semc> I died to flies
<Roflbot> lol
<semc> and was like, welp i'm done
<Sylandest> That_British_Guy: we may have over HNNNg'ed him
<User0> twilight_sprinkle: control would probably be the biggest issue, especially with collisions with other lightsabers (bound to have leaks)
<That_British_Guy> XXXXXXXXXDDDDDDDDDDD
<Midnight_Tempest> i remember my first time playing New Vegas... got molested by a pack of Radscorpions
<Floris> I would stream SSBB :p
<alexxm> have you tried changing the difficultly semc
<pyrocatboy> 6
<TheRainbowDash> Midnight_Tempest: Oh my....
<pyrocatboy> 8*
<That_British_Guy> So....what now???
<alexxm> how did that happen Midnight_Tempest
<semc> i had just exited the vault with no clue how to fight or where to go
<CriticKitten> Jim: Huh. I'll have to keep trying then. Shame, it's a big download so I wanted to get started right away. :(
<TheRainbowDash> Midnight_Tempest: Molestia approves of her workers.:)
<twilight_sprinkle> User0: probably, but thats atm, they are working on magnetic field manipulation and powerful portable energy sources
<Roflbot> ooo dead space sale on steam
<User0> twilight_sprinkle: and stray metal and whatnot could make everything fail
<semc> so I gave up
<Sylandest> That_British_Guy: he may have gone afk
<Kammerjunk> Nobody in the world ever gets what they want, and that is beautiful. Everybody dies frustrated and sad and that is beautiful.
<Roflbot> lol Semc
<That_British_Guy> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<User0> twilight_sprinkle: do you realize how hard it is to store and move energy?
<Roflbot> the game is free roam you dont have to go to a certain spot
<That_British_Guy> Well then we need a new judge
<Midnight_Tempest> alexxm: i went down the hill behind goodsprings, where the graveyard was... got destroyed
<Jim> yeah, good idea
<twilight_sprinkle> User0: and?
<alexxm> TheRainbowDash : Yes... Yes. This is a fertile land, and we will thrive. We shall rule over all this land, and we shall call it... 'This Land'"
<Roflbot> =*( no wild wild wasteland?
<Midnight_Tempest> TheRainbowDash: i didnt like being molested like that... i was hoping Molestia would do it herself...
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Nope, rather Dash's land.:)
<That_British_Guy> Who wants to be our new judge for the ddddddddddddaaaaawww competition?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> As I said... that guy was a Douche
<Derp> does anyone know how to get these animated ponies to put on your screen ?
<TheRainbowDash> Midnight_Tempest: ....Molestia has entered your game..."And you were saying?")
<alexxm> ok TheRainbowDash
<ehm> Derp, google "desktop ponies"
<semc> oh yeah and dying to crab people going neaar water
<WallMaster> I guess I will, I've been paying attention.
<Dark_Horst> dqawut?
<Midnight_Tempest> TheRainbowDash: Awwwww yeah... ^__^
<Shane377> hey all whose streaming?
<User0> twilight_sprinkle: I'm saying, nothing of such power will be feasable for anything other than proof of concept - It won't make it to actual war in my lifetime.
<Dark_Horst> wrek
<Dark_Horst> i think
<OmegaMetroidBrony> hai Shane337 Wrek
<alexxm> hey Shane377 hows your day been

<WallMaster> That_British_Guy: sure.
<ehm> That_British_Guy, just post the links -_-

<CCCP> brb
<That_British_Guy> http://tinuleaf.deviantart.com/favourites/49519355?offset=0#/d49cnt9 Why i love being a Ultra Marine :3
<TheRainbowDash> Alright then CCCP.:)
<Kipkat07_Mare> ehm: The clop side...
<CCCP> :)
<PonySwagg> XD Gotta love it
<TheRainbowDash> That_British_Guy: This confirms that I am the best pony.
<PonySwagg> TheRainbowDash: I know, right?
<TheRainbowDash> If not, it was already confrimed.
<pyrocatboy> 9
<Sylandest> TheRainbowDash: You're always the best pony. you're 120% best pony
<PonySwagg> ...
<TheRainbowDash> (confirmed)
<Kipkat07_Mare> TheRainbowDash: was there any real doubt?
<PonySwagg> Okay, you see this?
<PonySwagg> THIS is how you shoot
<ehm> Kipkat07_Mare, try guro.
<WallMaster> see, I dont have a favorite pony.
<Kipkat07_Mare> ehm: I dont want to :D
<pyrocatboy> 10?
<ehm> exactly.
<PonySwagg> Neither do I
<Joker1993> best pony? dashie
<Joker1993> clearly
<PonySwagg> But I do have preferences
<WallMaster> until Fighting is Magic comes out, then its whoever I main.
<twilight_sprinkle> see, sea
<TheRainbowDash> Joker1993: Aww yeah!:)
<PonySwagg> I identify with Rarity a bit more than others
<pyrocatboy> 11
<PonySwagg> But as for favorite?
<PonySwagg> Don't have one. ^^ They're ponies.
<Sylandest> ok, but really, i need to get back to work, lol. this essay is due tomorrow
<PonySwagg> I love them all.
<pyrocatboy> awesome shot
<TheRainbowDash> PonySwagg: Bu...bu Dashie!:D
<Joker1993> regardless of personal favouritism, dash is just the general all around best
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Dash IMO is kinda overrated
<derp_derp> dashie is obviously not best pony
<TheRainbowDash> Joker1993: And that is why you're 20% cooler than the rest....- Commander Dash
<Joker1993> omega, you just dont have the right mindset
<TheRainbowDash> OmegaMetroidBrony: Wait, what...
<Jim> I like Twilight and Pinkie
<Joker1993> you have to think in coolness, not what you like
<Bobeh> dashie is my second favorite. She's awesome. Gotta go with Pinkie Pie. Me and her are so much alike.
<twilight_sprinkle> best ponies are Twi, then Rarity, then Trixie, then everyopone ese. except fluttershy.
<Jason> o:
<derp_derp> rainbow dashie is not best pony
<TheRainbowDash> actually, in real life, I am more of a mix between Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy.:)
<derp_derp> faust alicorn is best pony
<Joker1993> unless you can suddenly appear whenever you want and become gelatin to show someone how to loosen up, you are nothing like pinekamina
<PonySwagg> You are entering into a world not of sight or sound, but of mind. A world with Friendship, Magic, and Ponies. There's a road sign up ahead. Next Stop: The Twilight Sparkle zone.
<FillyFlam> I'm like if Pinkie Pie had access to Urban Dictionary. And was a dick.
<Kipkat07_Mare> Im a mix between Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle
<PonySwagg> Sorry, had to do it. XD
<TheRainbowDash> BUT, Rainbow Dash was that pony that introduced me nito the fandom and actually got me hooked into it, and that is why I use this username today.:)
<TheRainbowDash> (into)
<Kipkat07_Mare> TheRainbowDash: same
<WallMaster> I used to like Fluttershy. I dont now, though.
<TheRainbowDash> No other pony stood out to me except My Little Dashie.
<PonySwagg> Wrex playing New Vegas?
<twilight_sprinkle> WallMaster: good
<OmegaMetroidBrony> yesh
<pyrocatboy> 12
<derp_derp> i am obviously more generous than rarity

<CCCP> ^
<Vordox> Cachi, give it a look if you want to... XD

<PonySwagg> Ohaithar.
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: ikr
<twilight_sprinkle> TheRainbowDash: RD seems like the most mentally strong/arrogant one, so destroying her psychie has a greater effect on viewers
<Kipkat07_Mare> TheRainbowDash: Why do they kill you? You are best at everything! Why do they kill you? :'(
<CCCP> ^
<Floris> I like Big Macintosh the most.
<icybeauti> Hello Flillyflam,TheRainbowDash,WallMaster,and PonySwagg
<PonySwagg> TheRainbowDash: Take heart. What Rainbow Dash does in Fallout: Equestria will have you both cheering and crying when you finally find out.
<CCCP> Chrysalis is BEST pony
<Litwick> I'm loving this 50's music.
*Kipkat07_Mare kills all the ficwriters who kill RD
<TheRainbowDash> twilight_sprinkle: But it can be to a point that it damages people's relationship with ponies....do you know of the damage that Cupcakes and clopfics with Rainbow Dash did to the community? TONS.
<PonySwagg> But int he end...
<CCCP> Litwick: me too
<PonySwagg> EVERYPONY bites the big one.

<prince-dari> Well you're allowed to discuss topics, just keep it civil
<ehm> Tech support questions go in #derpy_hooves
<Sylandest> icybeauti: we had some folks arguing over fanfics and their writers yesterday. mods had to step in to cool things down and move them to private chat
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Then came the ponies...
<twilight_sprinkle> it wasnt civil.
<icybeauti> WallMaster Sounds fun...I guess I'm a little thankful my brother kicked me out yesterday
<cachi01> john madden john madden 999999999999 aeiou aeiou DAYUMMMM gotta get $ aaaaaaaaaaaaaah
*OmegaMetroidBrony shudders.
<Litwick> Now I'm gettin a gray screen.
<Litwick> Not black, gray.
<PonySwagg> Nice shot.
<PonySwagg> Seriously, NICE SHOT
<icybeauti> cachi01 ehmagawd I luv that! /)
<twilight_sprinkle> most arguments get killed early here, which annoys me, but yesterdays wasnt killed early enough.
<PonySwagg> Buffer...
<User0> cachi01: you forgot the exclamation marks after the john maddens
<cachi01> yaaay (\ :)
<icybeauti> twilight_sprinkle That's good hear. I would actually consider this place a safe chatroom.
<PonySwagg> Congratulations, PowderGangers
<Sylandest> twilight_sprinke: but now, its alright because we're all enjoying ourselves and relaxing :)
<cachi01> lol true User0
<PonySwagg> You just got pwn'd
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Lol no safety here
<Sylandest> *twilight_sprinkle
<icybeauti> Much better than like omegel
<twilight_sprinkle> Sylandest: speak for yourself, i have a crapton of homework and an exam to prepare for :\
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :D
<PonySwagg> Every Day I'm Buffering.
*PonySwagg plays shuffling music.

<twilight_sprinkle> icybeauti: i would still like to have more freedom for discussion here, yesterday got out of hand tho, altho imo only 1 person got out of hand...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> NV
<TheRainbowDash> cachi01: Eeyup.
<PonySwagg> I think this is the first playthrough I've seen
<Sniper_Xephos> ey peeps
<Vordox> WHOA! A My Little pony with 3 million HITS?!
<PonySwagg> Where the Powder Gangers lost without anyone dying
<twilight_sprinkle> Sylandest: btw, press tab when typing a name and itll do the rest
<TheRainbowDash> Vordox: Wait, what do you mean by that?:P
<PonySwagg> You sir, are good.
<icybeauti> twilight_sprinkle There's a small gap between heated debate and argument. Once you start throwing insults around, it's no longer a heated debate.
<Vordox> A youtube video with MLP with over 3 million hits.
<Sylandest> twilight_sprinkle: oh ty for telling me that. so much typing! lol
<semc> later ya'll
<semc> thanks for the stream
<twilight_sprinkle> Sylandest: ikr :P
<TheRainbowDash> Vordox: Is is that one with Rainbow Dash and The Offspring?:D
<cachi01> fun fact 3 million is over 9000
<Sylandest> laters semc!
<twilight_sprinkle> icybeauti: exactly, and as i recall, only 1 person yesterday was doing the insults
<Vordox> Yeah TheRainBowDash
<icybeauti> Offspring? Luv them. Rainbow dash? Luv. Both. -rainboom-
<Sniper_Xephos> theres a glitch here to earn XP
<TheRainbowDash> Vordox: Yeah, seen that 1000 times now.:D
<Petrified_Discord> Did y'all know that originally it was "Over 8000" but they changed it for the English dub
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<Daring_Do> there we go
<icybeauti> twilight_sprinkle This place is pretty chilled, but something will come up every now and then.
<PonySwagg> TheRainbowDash: So how did you feel about performing a Sonic Rainboom on command at the wedding? Think any Wonderbolts saw it?
<twilight_sprinkle> 5 million money is also over 9000
<Vordox> Hmm...Perhaps if we mix a super famous song with MLP...A good song mind you.. What would that be... Rolling Stones, Metallica? Nirvana?
<Daring_Do> rawr
<Kandarihu> Yeah. Something about the mouth flaps
<TheRainbowDash> PonySwagg: Well, let's just say that I'll be flying with some Bolts next season.:)
<Daring_Do> weird
<icybeauti> Vordox Do wolfmother and MLP. They actually have fitting songs like White Unicorn and Apple Tree
<PonySwagg> TheRainbowDash: We can only hope!
<twilight_sprinkle> icybeauti: yesterday was the most heated one ive seen. usually the only thing that gets people mad is being shut up by mods
<Vordox> True, Icybeauti. But we need something more famous to spread MLP. ;)
<CCCP> i like Caravan Palace
<twilight_sprinkle> icybeauti: or at least i know im chill until that happens
<Petrified_Discord> Hold onto your wings, TheRainbowDash. I'll be back next season too :)
<Litwick> Yup. mips is officially the new YouTube. Buffers just as bad, and never fucking works when you want it to.
<icybeauti> twilight_sprinkle I walked into the cafeteria after being upstairs for lunch in a tacher's room and there was a fist fight.
<PonySwagg> CCCP: I KNOW RITE
<CCCP> :$
<TheRainbowDash> Petrified_Discord: Ok then. I'm ready for that!:)
<CCCP> dat spelling
<icybeauti> We should all hibernate until fall.
<Sylandest> icybeauti: my goodness! what happened?
<twilight_sprinkle> icybeauti: cant tell if literally or symbolism o.o
<TheRainbowDash> PonySwagg: you going to Rite Aid or something right now?:D
<Vordox> Wait wait...WTF?! DAMNIT PINKIE! Why do you ruin that video with your Foam HAND in MLP?!!?
<PonySwagg> Just in time for the RUnning of the Leaves?
<PonySwagg> TheRainbowDash: XD You would think that.
<asneakykitty> well hello there friends :)
<CCCP> hi asneakykitty
<twilight_sprinkle> hello asneakykitty
*PonySwagg spots asneakykitty

<PonySwagg> TheRainbowDash: XD
<TheRainbowDash> Hello asneakykitty! (waves)
<icybeauti> Sylandest, twlight_sprinkle I dunno. My friend had to go buy lunch, so we went to the lunch line and there was a fight on the far cornor of the cafeteria. The teachers sent like 6 kids to the office, and the most chilled teacher actually yelled today.
<Petrified_Discord> PonySwagg: My favorite part of Fall Wrap-Up. Also known as Fuck Off Fall :D
<asneakykitty> Haha, It's been a while!! No work for a while so I can join in on the fun :P
<PonySwagg> lol
<Sylandest> icybeauti: im glad you're alright. It sounds like it got pretty bad
<otakon> Wrek: playing a little New Vegas eh?
<Petrified_Discord> asneakykitty: We can DOUBLE it!
<icybeauti> Sylandest Yeah. I guess it was a good diea to stop hanging in the cafeteria.
<twilight_sprinkle> icybeauti: btw, press tab when typing a name and itll do the rest
<PonySwagg> My hopes for next season:
<asneakykitty> Ah! The fun has been doubled!
<PonySwagg> THE LUNA HAS BEEN DOUBLED
<Sylandest> icybeauti: indeed it was, lol
<icybeauti> twilight_sprinkle: Thanks. It's quiet a lot typing all the names out ;)

<icybeauti> Sylandest: Eyup. Tab is new best pony.
<twilight_sprinkle> icybeauti: cuz in my country teachers yell all the time

<icybeauti> twilight_sprinkles My math teacher and science teacher are bitched.
<asneakykitty> needs more plot
<twilight_sprinkle> icybeauti: my math teacher was angry as hell but he was a great guy tho
<Sylandest> icybeauti: i told her the same thing when she told me about the tab button, lol. and twilight_sprinkle, my teachers didnt yell much at all, only when we got too rowdy
<twilight_sprinkle> icybeauti: and the best teacher ive ever had, he was a math god
<OmegaMetroidBrony> You get more plot in Vegas once you get there
<PonySwagg> asneakykitty: You do know you're leaving yourself wide open, right? XD
<otakon> I HATE YOU MIPS!
<Ray> 02http://puu.sh/rtwz
<Ray> 02YES
<Aircrafter> I wonder if Wrek knows the easy way to get too Novac...
<otakon> stop lagging!
<icybeauti> twilight_sprinkle: My math teacher is an old women who's balding, fat, and has a mustache. Shes kinda a bitch, but it's probably because she's old.

<Aircrafter> Petrified_Discord: So they're like...Mares? But...Human?
<Roflbot> Vats is like Aimbot

<TheRainbowDash> Oh, ok SlurryMoon...and hello! How are you today?:)
<icybeauti> Uakh: Is there some ratio or something?
<Aircrafter> SlurryMoon: Doing nothing SlurryMoon is best SlurryMoon
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I used VATS once. I got a zero percent to hit "that".
<twilight_sprinkle> icybeauti: are you interestd in foreign language?

<twilight_sprinkle> well actually i only tried a wallhack

<otakon> PrincessDismo: he wasn't a mod
<otakon> prince-dari: hiya man
<ScootaChicken> PrincessDismo: Lolwut? I was never a mod.
<Sylandest> icybeauti: it matters not: fluttershy has made it into the realm of human fashion!

<icybeauti> Aircrafter Fluttershy has the potential to break the fourth wall. But she just chooses not to.
<otakon> ehm nice thanks
<ScootaChicken> Actually no, he's online right now
<ScootaChicken> So that wouldn't work
<Aircrafter> icybeauti: This can't get any better.
<ScootaChicken> My god, is he ever offline? He's like the new dari or something.
<Aircrafter> Unless Rarity breaks the fourth wall....
<Aircrafter> Or Rainbow Dash...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ScootaChicken = Spanish Inquisition?
<icybeauti> Aircrafter if you want the shirt, go to hot topic and find your size in girl's tees.
<otakon> brb
<DashWithRainbows> Dat double kick
<alexxm> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<ScootaChicken> That was totally deliberate.
<Aircrafter> I was Wrecked?
<Dken2021|Earthbound> Double kick all the way...... what does it mean?
<TheRainbowDash> Aircrafter: I tried many times now...still never works....(cries)
<Aircrafter> Boom Headshot?.....
<TheRainbowDash> Dken2021|Earthbound: Kicking party?:P
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Dat Earthbound

<Aircrafter> <--- Logic Defied
*Sylandest hugs TheRainbowDash

*OmegaMetroidBrony loves Earthbound
<Sylandest> one day, TheRainbowDash, one day
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: I can't break that 4th wall...
*alexxm hugs TheRainbowDash
<ScootaChicken> It seems like it's been deliberately designed to piss off otakon
<Aircrafter> TheRainbowDash: Its ok. I'm here for you. You'll break it one day. -hugs-
<Dken2021|Earthbound> kicking? I love kicking!
<icybeauti> ScootaChicken :D
<DashWithRainbows> ScootaChicken Who wouldn't want to make something to do that?
<Wrek> 05gona free beagle, sell mah shit
<Wrek> 05and grab a drink
<Wrek> 05then continue drawing my pretties
<Aircrafter> Like a Boss?
<Anotherguy> Wrek sounds good
<TheRainbowDash> http://fav.me/d4284sa Just tried again....did not work...:'(
<RoboGerbil> hmm the player doesnt know that maxing your int at level 1 gives you a lot more skill points at level up
*alexxm hugs TheRainbowDash
<Dken2021|Earthbound> green green, I'm new at this
<ScootaChicken> DashWithRainbows: I don't know.
<ScootaChicken> otakon is just the lovable guy that everyone is intensely cruel to
<ScootaChicken> Even the mods.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: huh?
<Aircrafter> If I do get a fallout for the PC, should it be 3 or New Vegas?
<TheRainbowDash> ScootaChicken: Wait, what...
<icybeauti> Dken2021|Earthbound: -you must be new here face-
<ScootaChicken> Hush otakon, it's alright.
<otakon> Aircrafter: Vegas
<RoboGerbil> Aircrafter: new vegas is slightly better than 3
<TheRainbowDash> ScootaChicken: I act like a mod too here in the chat, but I'm too silly to be cruel!:)
<ScootaChicken> otakon is so adorable.
*Vordox is bored... But not in the reading mood or gaming mood.
<cachi01> my pony is much bigger than yours!!!!!!
<RobertRevenge> ScootaChicken: Wut.
*alexxm licks Vordox
<ScootaChicken> Cruelness and silliness are two sides of the same coin.
<Kandarihu> But no Liberty Prime, though. Right?
<ScootaChicken> They often cross each others paths.
<Wrek> 05personalyl I enjoy NV more than i ever did fallout 3.
<Vordox> That certainly didn't help Alexxm. XD
<TheRainbowDash> ScootaChicken: Yay!
<Dken2021> icybeauti will you accept happy happyism in your life?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> No Liberty Prime :(
<Aircrafter> cachi01: Look at my Pony, My ponys amazing, give it a lick.
<alexxm> sorry Vordox
<twilight_sprinkle> mmm it tastes just like pingas
<Wrek> 05however the story is better IMO in F:3 compared to NV
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Licking actually is the answer to all wub problems.:P
<ScootaChicken> For example, SB is a silly filly, but he also says 'moo' a lot.
<cachi01> Aircrafter: it tastes like rainbows
<Wrek> 05atleast the main story
<ScootaChicken> Which is racist to cows or something/
<icybeauti> Dken2021: I will, if you accept pinkie pie as the best cupcake maker.
<ehm> Aircrafter, don't ask where the friendship is made
*alexxm licks TheRainbowDash
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Though I do enjoy the FO:NV DLC more than the FO:3
<Vordox> Perhaps I should draw myself as a Pony just for the lols.
<Aircrafter> cachi01: With a tug of its mane, it turns into a plane, and then it turns back again when you tug on its pinkie.
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Oh my....(wingboner)...see?:D
<RoboGerbil> main story maybe. but the dlc was second rate and it doesnt have near as many options as NV
<Aircrafter> ehm: .....Where is it made?
<alexxm> i see TheRainbowDash so can the children
<ScootaChicken> I never bought a single NV DLC
<Dken2021> icybeauti never! she isn't blue! all creatures that isn't blue are inferior!
<ehm> Aircrafter, continue the lyrics :p
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: eeyup.
<Aircrafter> Guess I'll decide. I enjoy F3 more for its apocalyptic feel, but New Vegas is just so much more expansive....
<Anotherguy> What children? Once a brony, always a man!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Gun Runners Arsenal make the Anti-Materiel Rifle even more OP.
<ScootaChicken> I did buy the GOTY version of F3 and I enjoyed all those DLCs.
<alexxm> i know Anotherguy
<Anotherguy> or woman
<icybeauti> Dken2021: So you accept the smurves as your supreme ruler?
<Aircrafter> Ohh A party. Do you like it? Guess I won't show you where the Cider is made, sweet cider, yes sweet Cider.
<CriticKitten> Whee. Download still going. And will be all night I figure. XD
<Dken2021> Blue, Blue.....

<QT_Marks> these shoes are made for walkin
<Petrified_Discord> No doubt it will. They're not about to do the concept art all over again.
<phobos2390> If they pull the same stunt they did last time, it looks like season 3 will begin around the same time season 2 will begin.
<JRP2234{laaaaaaaaaaa> l
<CupcakeWarrior> What day was bronystate started?
<Petrified_Discord> Well it DOES say 2012-2013, so it has to begin sometime in that time period
<Biglaw> the trippiness has been doubled!
<phobos2390> so sometime like september or august this year.
<Jim> I just know that Season 3 will be great
<phobos2390> Probably will be
<Bronysith> Biglaw heres a life lesson NEVER EAT BROWNIES before going to a pink floyd show
<CupcakeWarrior> lol
<Petrified_Discord> Season 3: "20% Cooler or your bits back."
<Biglaw> Bronysith why?
<RainbowAsh> ivisiblexmas, as far as I know these infos are backed by some more or less secure sources. The McCarthy and Discord ones are quite official I think, there were official tweets that mentioned 13 as the numbers of episodes and some studio webpage also listed that they would only work on that number
<Bronysith> Biglaw: you know why
<CupcakeWarrior> I like the feeling I get when I listen to Pink Floyd
<Biglaw> Okay everypony, got any suggestions for what I can draw?
<phobos2390> Now that we're done with season 1, what's everypony's thoughts on season 2?
<RainbowAsh> ivisiblexmas, about Polsky I am not quite that sure, but I heard it numerous times
<Petrified_Discord> Biglaw: Lonely changeling?
<Bronysith> Biglaw um celestia stabbing discord with her horn
<Biglaw> -_-
<Petrified_Discord> Bronysith: :|
<alexxm> i thought season 2 was good phobos2390
<Merc_Xephos> ello
<phobos2390> Season 1 stayed in ponyville and you got more of a slice of life, while season 2 was more broad.
<CupcakeWarrior> Bronysith: Kinky?
<junh1024-XD> CECH C02 model, has SACD logo on the side
<rainbowdash002> why u guys up to
<Bronysith> CupcakeWarrior wait wat
<phobos2390> And was more character driven
<Jim> Everything and nothing at the same time.
<Biglaw> any OTHER suggestions?
<pyrocatboy> Biglaw: A purple pooping people eater?
<ivisiblexmas> RainbowAsh: Thanks for info
<RainbowAsh> phobos2390, in my opinion, the best episodes of season 2 were better than the best of season 1 and the worst of season 2 weren't as bad as season one either. But s1 has a more solid middle field.
<Petrified_Discord> Celestia couldn't beat the power of love, what makes anypony think she could beat the power of CHAOS? She didn't even bucking TRY!
<rainbowdash002> is this pink floyd
<RainbowAsh> ivisiblexmas, you're welcome ^^
<CupcakeWarrior> Just watching the concert makes me feel high
*alexxm gives TheRainbowDash a stomach rub
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: I....won't take the wrong way now...:D
<SoundLag> Is twilight learning this concert?
<TheRainbowDash> But ok!
<alexxm> what TheRainbowDash
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Nothing, really.
<CupcakeWarrior> The concert os Twi's imagination
<CupcakeWarrior> is*
<alexxm> ok TheRainbowDash
<Midnight_Tempest> WHOO! IM FEELING TIPSY ALREADY! ^__^ *dances around*
<Jim> She's reading Concerts for Dummies
<QT_Marks> twi has the best imagination
<phobos2390> RainbowAsh: Season 2 has a broader reach and had more individual character episodes. Season 1 stuck with ponyville.
<Petrified_Discord> Nah, Twilight is too much of a goody-goody to go to a concert :D
<Petrified_Discord> "Did you say DRUGS?!"
<drfsupercenter> 03wait, you found a SACD one?
<Jim> dat EQD banner
<phobos2390> RainbowAsh: not that it was a bad thing
<NightSeas> 2ohai Drake
<Drake> 04Hey NightSeas
<Everlasting_Joy> I need to go.
<TheRainbowDash> Bye Everlasting_Joy! (kisses you)
<Petrified_Discord> Carry on, Everlasting_Joy
<Petrified_Discord> Chat just got 20% less joyful
<junh1024-XD> yes?
<Jim> bai everl- he's gone
<RainbowAsh> phobos2390, they did do some travel outside of ponyville in s1 as well. I actually disliked the episodes that centered on a single character without giving her a side character to interact with, i.e. Read it and weep and baby cakes.
<drfsupercenter> 03so you have two PS3s now?
<junh1024-XD> the point of buying a PS3 is ONLY for SACD
<junh1024-XD> i sold off the other one to my friend yesterday
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah for me it's to play Blu-Rays + linux
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<Jim> I liked Read it and Weep a lot
<cachi01> im going guys see u later :)
<ivisiblexmas> i like Baby cakes
<cachi01> thx for the pink floyd stream
<Jim> cya cachi01
<Dken2021> seeya cachi01
<junh1024-XD> (ripping them, hence FW 3.55-, linux, etcetc)
<drfsupercenter> 03is yours old firmware?
<Midnight_Tempest> anyone else here wanna get drunk with me?
<NightSeas> 2I plan on getting a PS3 for Final Fantasy on one disk and HD Rayman
<Merc_Xephos> me midnight
<junh1024-XD> apparently so
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL BUYING CONSOLES JUST FOR ONE GAME
<drfsupercenter> 03and nice
<drfsupercenter> 03good find :P
<alexxm> sure Midnight_Tempest
<ivisiblexmas> i would but when i get drunk i get murdery
<NightSeas> 2and Blu-Ray
<junh1024-XD> i'm buying a console for ZERO games
<junh1024-XD> beatthat!
<phobos2390> RainbowAsh: Season 1 stuck with ponyville more than Season 2. We had Best Night Ever and the elements of harmony. I don't consider the everfree forest outside of the realm of ponyville.
<drfsupercenter> 03now go rip me SACDs
<drfsupercenter> 03junh1024-XD me too
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't use mine for games
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah I do use it to play Blu-Rays
<alexxm> and sonic rainboom phobos2390
<junh1024-XD> >tells me to rip SACDs
<Midnight_Tempest> Merc_Xephos and alexxm: go get yourself some drinks than, cause the whiskey im drinking is mine alone. sorry.
<phobos2390> Alexxm: Yeah, that too
<junh1024-XD> >?doesn't even play my surround mixes
<junh1024-XD> >MFW
<RainbowAsh> phobos2390, s1 also had Appleosa, Cloudsdale and Manehattan
<drfsupercenter> 03OK so I tried that replaygain thing
<drfsupercenter> 03it works a BIT better than straight
<drfsupercenter> 03but still has oddities
<Petrified_Discord> And S2 had...well, they never said.
<Merc_Xephos> *gets vodka* lets drink!
<alexxm> and the rock farm RainbowAsh
<drfsupercenter> 03also is the replaygain stored in the track itself or only in the Winamp library?
<Ouroboros> Any chance of showing the new Avatar series at some point?
*alexxm downs beer
<junh1024-XD> track i?
<Midnight_Tempest> yes! *toasts Merc_Xephos*
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah track, not album
<RainbowAsh> alexxm, that one was on the outskirts of ponyville though, to be fair
<drfsupercenter> 03because they're all different albums
*Petrified_Discord drinks beer and becomes sober
<Merc_Xephos> *drinks vodka*
<drfsupercenter> 03I used a VM with the newer Winamp
<Petrified_Discord> Goddamit
<kirzstryfe> 1,3had a customer at work today, moved just like a boomer from L4D2, even made the noises >.<
<ekips> there is a new avatar series?!
<junh1024-XD> also note no volume analysis algorithm is prefect.
<alexxm> was that ever confirmed RainbowAsh
<Merc_Xephos> *gets drunk*
<RainbowAsh> alexxm, Pinkie said so
<junh1024-XD> i beleiove most RG ones use the old RMS
<ZetaMetroidBrony> Dear lord Kirz
<Jim> kirzstryfe: Did he barf all over the place?
<drfsupercenter> 03well it's better than nothing
<drfsupercenter> 03but I still have to fix More and More due to >really quietintro
<CupcakeWarrior> Ohai kirz, that sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03+space
<alexxm> i don't rember that RainbowAsh
<Petrified_Discord> And then a bunch of other customers flooded the store.
<Ouroboros> Yes :) legend of korra
<junh1024-XD> there are newer ones like loudness and perceived loudness which may use weighting curves
<Petrified_Discord> I just realized something: come the end of summer when everyone is bummed, the bronies shall rejoice, for Ponies are returning.
<Merc_Xephos> ugh i think i see a bird *shoots M4A1 randomly and hits Midnight_Tempest*
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol, thankfully no, but he waddled just like the boomer, and when he though nobody was around he made that urrrp'ing sound they make just before they spew
<junh1024-XD> and even then, it probably isn't perfect, because when i compare volumes of songs, i might not even be actually listening to the song overall
<junh1024-XD> maybe i'm latching onto the vocal levels
<ZetaMetroidBrony> ...
<Zephyr> love this song =D
<Midnight_Tempest> Merc_Xephos: Nuu... *is shot in the back*
<ZetaMetroidBrony> Not sure if Laughable or disturbed
<alexxm> you sure he wasn't cosplaying kirzstryfe
<phobos2390> Petrified_Discord: What? Why will everyone be bummed?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> There we go...
<drfsupercenter> 03I usually focus on the first note you hear
<Merc_Xephos> ugh surry
<drfsupercenter> 03since that kinda determines if it's too loud or not
<ivisiblexmas> kirzstryfe: mabye he was a fan of the game
<Ouroboros> Its set 40-50 years after Anngs time, Korra being the next incarnation. Looks like it's got potential.
<drfsupercenter> 03even if it gets quieter/louder later on
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol
<RainbowAsh> alexxm, around 16:07 in the chronicles she says "My sisters and I were raised on a rock farm outside of Ponyville"
<Midnight_Tempest> XD kirzstryfe... i think we have been playing too much L4D2
<drfsupercenter> 03if it's naturally getting louder during the song it's less noticeable than just right in your face loud note
<Petrified_Discord> phobos2390: I'm operating under the assummption that people like summer and dislike school. Honestly I hate the summer tho, so...idk. :)
<Ouroboros> They've broadcast the first 3 episodes so far.

<Bronysith> kirzstryfe eeyup
<phobos2390> Petrified_Discord: I don't know whether I will hate the return of school or not.
<Midnight_Tempest> kirzstryfe and Bronysith: ive been drinking... so if we play today, its gonna be awesome... more awesome than usual
<alexxm> i thought that meant not near ponyville RainbowAsh
<pyrocatboy> -eats Bronysith-

<pyrocatboy> Oh nothing special, just MAH BASS CANNON!!!!!!
*Midnight_Tempest tackles and strangle Merc_Xephos. 'No one shoots the booze!'
<RainbowAsh> alexxm, I think "outside" signifies the nearest point of reference. It's not in Ponyville, but it's the closest town
<Bronysith> Midnight_Tempest awesome we should play as soon as jake gets on

*xmasjedi cuts Bronysith in half with lightsabre
<Tarku> Ohai everypony :3

<RyunosukeKnT> RainbowAsh: don't go confusin me with yur fancy mathematics
<alexxm> i'm confused about what you guys are talking about

<Petrified_Discord> Bronysith: Impressive, most impressive...but you are no Poni yet...
<LunaTheBeloved_> Cello Val
<RainbowAsh> CupcakeWarrior, if I would start learning to code today, I wouldn't get into c++ anymore either. I hear python is much simpler. But once you got the basics down it is not all that hard.

<ekips> and there is ONE other brony in my area, I just HAVE to find him/her :D
<RainbowAsh> phobos2390, with c++ you might also want to have a look at the standard libraries. There are handy templates to make lists that are often easier to use than templates. Or, especially if you want to make windows programs, you could try a framework like qt, which also offers many more functions.
<pony_949> im one in argentina

<ghostxmas> Bronysith: on my planet the casual greeting is with slashes im impervious to all slashing and hacking anything sharp to but my species main weakness is our very weak necks
<phobos2390> RainbowAsh: thanks for helping, I need to learn the entire language before the beginning of the school year so I can take a data structures and algorithms class at the same time as an object oriented programming class.

<RainbowAsh> phobos2390, since you already know java, you should be fine. Just remember to always delete the memory you assigned with new.
<Merc_Xephos> I AM MORE THAN A MERC, GUN DEALER, ROYAL GUARD!
<Merc_Xephos> i also a wizard
<Petrified_Discord> Merc_Xephos: Not a sentence, but cool

<Merc_Xephos> no
<phobos2390> c++ seems to be the symbol language.
<Petrified_Discord> Merc_Xephos: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sab9rU38A-g
<Merc_Xephos> no wizard battle
<phobos2390> Java is a parentheses language
<Bobeh> has no clue what we are doing.
<RainbowAsh> phobos2390, yeah, but at least the compiler will tell you were you went wrong with missing ;. Memory leaks are a whole different ballgame.
<phobos2390> C# is a bracket language.
<Shamroc> soo how all thy ponys be fairing?

<Merc_Xephos> :'(
<ghostxmas> Bronysith: i think you have a misconception about my planet and my species no one on my planet could have destroyed anything because we cant survive outside of our planet for more than a day

<Merc_Xephos> OH-DA-VHING *dragon comes*
<phobos2390> RainbowAsh: What about pointers though? and multiple inheritance?
<junh1024-XD> how is hardware better than soft?
<Bronysith> ghostxmas besides you were on my planet attacking ME off of your planet
<Merc_Xephos> my dragon :)
<Litwick> Why is there a firefox message covering the video?
<phobos2390> RainbowAsh: Arrays also work differently in c++
<Shamroc> Litwick: cause who-ever is streamin is afk and doesnt notice it

*DeathStar climbs onto DovahKiin_Xephos's head
<RainbowAsh> phobos2390, true, c++ does have some unique elements. But I don't think they are that hard to understand when you already know the general workings of another programming language. At least that was my experience when I dabbled a bit in java and php.
<Petrified_Discord> Blue_Leaf: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2ypxbZEuj1rnl2pl.jpg
<ghostxmas> Bronysith OBJECTION: my parents own the second fastest ship which takes roughly 2 hours to reach your planet they sent me to your house with detailed directions
*DeathStar attempts to dance

<DeathStar> aww screw it

<LonelyPony> Arguement solved.

<phobos2390> So many xephoses
<linkerman> Normally it's a bunch of shadows
<Spartan_Xephos> *randomly fires at Freed_Discord and Blue_Leaf*
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Please don't link videos while a stream is running
<Blue_Leaf> -Jumps on top of a cotton candy cloud and noms on it-
<RainbowAsh> phobos2390, I know that one.
<Shamroc> kirzstryfe ELL THERE
<Shamroc> ELLO*
<owlicious> oh, saw it
<phobos2390> we've got Spartan_Xephos, Knife_Xephos, and who knows what else.
<drfsupercenter> 03owait, >not buy it now
<mario_pony> bad phobos2390
<linkerman> Let's look at how much peoples have Shadow in their names!
<RainbowAsh> Btw, anyone watched Iron Sky? I saw it in the cinema last week and found it quite awesome.
<Spartan_Xephos> *changes again*

<phobos2390> and gun_dealer_xephos, so much xephos. makes me think yogscast
<drfsupercenter> 03is the otheros++ thing better than the "legit" way?
<linkerman> Lol
<junh1024-XD> BE PREPARED
<drfsupercenter> 03Mine is still the legit way
<junh1024-XD> to go through
<junh1024-XD> http://wiki.gitbrew.org/wikibrew/PS3:OtherOS++
<Merc_Xephos> Merc_Xephos is back
<phobos2390> cccp: Hello fatherland!
<junh1024-XD> and http://wiki.gitbrew.org/wikibrew/PS3:Linux
<Merc_Xephos> *takes out minigun*
<drfsupercenter> 03wait
<drfsupercenter> 03"Can be used to downgrade your ps3 from 3.55 to lower firmwares. "
<junh1024-XD> otheros++ is trickier but allows you more access to hardware
<drfsupercenter> 03say what
<kirzstryfe> 1,3imnotjustaderper, I just said do not link videos while a stream is running
*linkerman takes out roleplaying manual
<drfsupercenter> 03I still have the firmware file of 3.14
<drfsupercenter> 03when I heard they were removing OtherOS I saved it
<Merc_Xephos> *fires at Freed_Discord*
<junh1024-XD> you can't downgrade FW by software iirc
*linkerman uses roleplaying manual as a shield
<drfsupercenter> 03PS3 Dual Boot GameOS/Linux CFW 3.55 SPECIAL - QA Flag CFW with SS patches, Can be used to downgrade your ps3 from 3.55 to lower firmwares. <- then what is that?
<phobos2390> Kirzstryfe: why no links to videos again?
<Freed_Discord> You see class, the difficulty with Merc_Xephos is that he is breaking 2 fundamental rules
<junh1024-XD> mbdn0
<kirzstryfe> 1,3because it's rude to the person streaming
<Freed_Discord> 1) He is randomly trying to kill everyone for no reason
<phobos2390> So much discord
<Freed_Discord> 2) He discredits the world that everyone else lives in
<Merc_Xephos> not everyone just you and blue leaf :P
<phobos2390> kirzstryfe: ok
<Freed_Discord> So we can only assume 2 things:
<Blue_Leaf> -Poofs into a draconequus and helps Discord spred chaos- .3.
<linkerman> Ah, but who wants to live in this world more than in Equestria?
<nickstr> depends on the revision
<Blue_Leaf> spread*
<nickstr> on the PSP you can
<nickstr> in fact I did
<Freed_Discord> 1) Merc_Xephos is a troll or 2) Merc_Xephos is insane
<Merc_Xephos> insane
<Freed_Discord> Very well.
<nickstr> I used a software downgrader to go from 2.0 to 1.5 and then from 1.5 to custom firmware
<Freed_Discord> >:]
<Merc_Xephos> *shoots Freed_Discord*
<Blue_Leaf> Brb.
<linkerman> Wait, are you telling me I'm more insane then?
*Freed_Discord undestands that Merc_Xephos has dellusions of shooting him
<linkerman> Because I do know laot of peoples would say I am insane
<rainbowdash002> is the streamer not here cause that things been up for awhile

<Shizuka> 13it doesn't scan in english, doesn't scan in rebus, it just doesn't scan
<Shizuka> 13it's unintelligible
<cow334> hello Shizuka
<RainbowAsh> CCCP, during the rehearsal? Well, it was pretty obvious from their first meeting that something was really wrong with Cadence, but Twilight went a bit overboard with all the "evil".
<Shizuka> 13to put it simply YOUR SENTENCE IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD
<cow334> modern warfare lol
<robotdragon7> yyyy=WISE
<otakon> Shizuka: ouch Shizu that's harsh
<cow334> is sentence was not bad i under stood it

<Shamroc> oh im here then
<robotdragon7> ur= YOU ARE
<Magic> good camio

<Litwick> stream froze
<Biglaw> Question for everypony: If you could have the choice, would you live in Equestria?
<cow334> Shizuka: i had a test today about proper english and how people say stuff like BRB in stead of be right back they say it messes up your english and your talking
<RAWRity> So, somebody on Rotten Tomatoes gave "The Avengers" a negative review (3 stars out of 5), and she's now been flooded with 300+ Comments.
<RainbowAsh> CCCP, if Twilight's case was a bit weaker from what we had seen previously, I probably would have, too.
<ekips> ohai buffer
<Shizuka> 13yes because the mass murder of millions is just HILARIOUS
<otakon> and now it lags dammit
<twilight_sprinkle> Biglaw: duh, yes
<owlicious> no, that's spelling
<Shizuka> 13it's right up there with jokes that there aren't girls on the internet

<CCCP> RainbowAsh: ya i guess
<robotdragon7> gosh i just made a riddle....
<Biglaw> Question for everypony: how do you think Celestia sends ponies to the moon?
<RAWRity> These comments have ranged from "psh I bet you like twilight" to "this is why you don't send women to see a good movie" to "I bet she's a DC fanboy"
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: lol that would be mass murder.
<CCCP> Biglaw: russia
<Magic> i belieave it would be a good place to live
<RAWRity> Really makes me want to kill people. A lot of people.
