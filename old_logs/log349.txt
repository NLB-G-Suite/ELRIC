<CloudSabre> they have awesome voices
<Busterdrag> or Equestria propaganda, whatever
<pony_4193> WE WILL KNOW LALALA
<fluttershyfan158> i see lyra
<maxderp> im thinking celestia and luna just showed up later and was like 'sup guys, i got wings and a horn.. worship me'
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And that's how Pinkie Pie got her cutie mark.
<maxderp> and then everyone was just like
<Blabbytaco> LLLLLLLLLAAAAAAALLLLLLA
<Liquid_vertibird> WILD GUESSING ENSUES
<Gumri> I guess they found the old flag offenssive?
<Rhymeless_Zebra> Please rise for your Equestria National Anthem
<pony_4371> WILL SEE US THROUGH!
<MoscowPony> *wears the hat off*
<Randomnerd> Yes, and most world war II movies have too many stars on old glory.
<DainbowRash> Clone audience
<JayDee> IT BURNS
<Soupjuice> im dissapointed discord wasnt in this episode
<flamingrockofdoom> LAUGHTER AND SINGINING
<Mistshadoww> And that's how Equestria was made!
<Nexusdragon> this predates luna/celestia/discord
<ofna01> sing applebloom
<maxderp> sure
<dispoint> strange luna/celestia flag
<Cavy> ^@ Nittany_Discord.
<ElementOfNaivity> oh god i am the Equestrian dream...
<Dr_Fluttershy> and then ponysex with hurricane and platinum
<Amras0000> dat flag is the most controversial part of MLP canon
<sonicrainboomer259> this show has continuity probs
<GameTaco> I bet all of the singing voices are simultaneously coming from Sweetie Belle.
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<TBi> X3
<kakashi6613> Will see us throughhhh
<Centaur> maybe they all individually worshipped them
<flutteryay> SO MANY CLONES
<FreezeFrame> I love the carol
*Sunset sing wit it :)
<Thunderpony> Pinky is the only one in a real dress
<irondaveh> freude schöner götterfunken
<Ducky> and thats how equestria was made
<Nova> reminds me of christmas caroling with my fami.y
<pony_4193> eeeeeendd
<DiscoDancingPony> i'd assume they're mythical beings used for heraldry
<pony_1v1> i hate happy endings
<Ingwaz> twilight and rarity stuck together...theyre such elitists
<NovedCheese> Hand to heart
<ExAxis> Me too
<randomname> the end
<JayDee> daww
<Captain> Why is Celestia and Luna immortal btw?
<Soupjuice> they could have un stone him or whatever and told him to act
<Highroller> i skipped this the last time i watched the episode
<Klutzershy9000> *rises*
<RaveBrony> Lol!! Nittany :D
<dispoint> y¿lazy layout artists
<Soupjuice> pffffrt
<fluttershyfan158> the end
<DiscoDancingPony> seeing as they are deities
<harmony1010> Equestria. Earth and all of the other names combined
<ProBrony> you must love grimdark
<Lords> also, Eurobeat Brony's Heart Carol is awesome version of that song
<pony_4371> how did alicorns come into equestria then?
<Cabrony> i see like 20 colgates
<Soarin> Ponies need more Q, err, John de Lancie, err Discord.
<HeavyMetalDash> because
<CountDoofus> I wish this how wars would truly end
<P0n-3> Because they're alicorns and stuff.
<pony117> hoof to heart
<CloudSabre> IM HONORED :D
<Thunderpony> Genetics

<Wrek> 05because, aliens.
<Marx> Now we need a Part 2 to explain the alicorns.
<irondaveh> pinkie :P
<Yahooz> Alright, prediction time: Hows about 20 more new regulars?
<DainbowRash> That
<ElementOfNaivity> Gene splicing
<Blabbytaco> why?
<Nornin> It's great :)
<pony_4371> lol
<James_Pony> that´s a story for another time
<Hazard3> lol
<Busterdrag> SHUT
<shadowdash> no duh
<pony_3641> Winter Wrap up
<Metostopholes> I really want more episodes with Equestrian history...
<nekohime1138> cross-breeding?
<Wiedlyra> Carol is the worst part
<Busterdrag> THE FUCKING
<CloudSabre> CLOSE THE WINDOW!!!!!
<Solar_Pony> Ranks last on my "Good Songs" list, but it will do
<Anonypony> Science.
<pony_4193> and now time for breakfast
<Ichijoe> 50 cycles after that she sent her sister to the moon
<ponyZalex> Best, episode, ever
<DocSane> And then Discord showed up and oppressed them.
<Ohfour> Too bad celestia didn't even attend the play
<Nexusdragon> discord ruled over equestira
<Anonypony> Humans?
<Amras0000> Star Swirl's special talent is genetics
<Busterdrag> WINDOOOOOOW
<irondaveh> window wrap up
<Rare> FreezeFrame, excellent poem
<P0n-3> Becuz MAGIC, Captain! Jeeeeez.

<Dismo> Captain: Magic *SnortSnort*
<Highroller> cross breeding
<NovedCheese> REWR
<DocSane> Then Celestia and Luna showed up to free them.
<ofna01> dont start this again
<Nexusdragon> this episode is how equestria was founded
<maxderp> might be a while before we get more
<DainbowRash> And back to the theme quarrel
<Havok_Pony> Carol is best song in series!
<pony_5531> http://crimsonbugeye.deviantart.com/art/How-Pinkie-Pie-got-her-cutie-mark-281949232
<NovedCheese> RAWR
<Jack85> :)
<Furzfanger> Oh my...
<CloudSabre> THEY ARE ARGUING
<Ponibas> Youre a dwarf among midgets
<FreezeFrame> One of my favorites
<ofna01> *facepalm*
<CallingCthulhu> Celestia was in a booth.
<ProBrony> i hope that one episoe of MLP involves Twilight asking all the hard questions
<dispoint> ok
<Soarin> You know Ponies are awesome when a guest-star (John De Lancie) makes you watch the entire series of Star Trek: The Next Generation just to watch Q.
<Thunderpony> Windy
<Rodman> Window > Discord
<Mistshadoww> Lies.
<Greycat_R> Derpy is hungry!
<Nexusdragon> therefor before discord
<Cabrony> alicorns will be explained when princess cadence appears
<Lord_Greener> Carol is the best part.
<kakashi6613> Three months of Winter Coolness
<ElementOfNaivity> Never mind that plothole!
<swerpin> Well done
<flutteryay> blame the pegususususues

<pony_3938> that sound...
<Liquid_vertibird> The princesses were sent back in time long after the era this series is set in
<rainbowHYPHEN> I wish that song would be expanded, god I love it
<kakashi6613> And awesome holidays
<Blabbytaco> blame twilight
<TwistedBlack> Yep.
<Dashie_Dashie> Because On_Godmode

<MelaPonie> well err dispoint, kinda funny you'd say something like that, somehow I ended up being the victim of a random act of kindness
<Dashie_Dashie> >.>
<otakon> but yh it's not completely reprehensible either
<Fluttershy94> Okay I did it :D
<Kencolt> I'm partial to Twilight myself. She's just the dort of mare I always wished to meet in college and never did, darn it.
<P0n-3> Yeah for some reason security companies like to put pictures of guards on their websites who look most like the people they're trying to guard against.
<bear2229> well at least we have someone protecting are unicorns
<P0n-3> I've never understood that one.
*MoscowPony drinks tea w/ lemon & cookies to warm

<Dashie_Dashie> so much racism from them and a lack of paticence.
<Th3Hat3d> Whatare they drawing
<Dashie_Dashie> @_@
<dispoint> i'm not trying to offend, i you mean that, you just reminded me the song
<CosmicLatte> SAVE THE UNICORNSES.
<P0n-3> Because Master, people who look a lot like the security guards pictured on the security company websites, are often up to no good.
<Nafedude> is this the lead singer of Crush 40?
<Dashie_Dashie> Later Scoot

<CountDoofus> oooh, that's gotta be Celestia

<TOY_PON3> Dat Molestia
<shadowdash> i prefer my ponies in HQ
<hawk> Looking good so far
<Ryanpyan> lol
<MelaPonie> Ichijoe, never had an apple product before, only used an acquaintences iPod touch before, and i really liked the thing
<kirzstryfe> 1,3yes, Wrek doesn't do r34
<CosmicLatte> The image is bothering me now.
<Fluttershy13> is it sad pinkamina pie thats being drawn?
<P0n-3> Oh I just realized that I moved on from cupcakes, I'm now fixated on pony-themed security companies.
<shadowdash> eyup :) id guess so
<Flare_Force> yeah
<NovedCheese> I be an Alberta Brony
<Ryanpyan> I always miss the eps because I sleep too much.
<sonicxsx> I just bought the best shirt ver!
<Fluttershy13> haha same here
<sonicxsx> ever*
<CosmicLatte> It's like.. creepy long-legged pony stalker watchin Twilight sleep
<MelaPonie> Ryanpyan, less sleep MOAR PONIES
*Dashie_Dashie wants to watch the new episode with TOY_PON3 but hopefully will have his errands done by time TITAN A.E. is done.
<MasterBrony> im fixated on destroying all websites that promote R34 ponies
<P0n-3> It's clearly Molestia.
<Ryanpyan> ikr?
<Wrek> 05urk that angle
<CosmicLatte> And we know of four long-legged ponies: Celestia, Luna, and.. Flim and Flam.
<TOY_PON3> :)
<NovedCheese> awwww
<Fluttershy13> :)
<CosmicLatte> LOL
<Ryanpyan> But I always stay up til 2-3 am
<Brony4life> big mac
<MasterBrony> @P0n-3 LOLOL
<Ichijoe> How is that a Pegasus, or an Earh Pony when it clearly has a Unicorn Horn?
<MelaPonie> ...yay...!
<sonicxsx> It has Rd and it says "This shirt just got 20 percent cooler"
<P0n-3> Dam Celly Y U so creepy! Stalkin' ur students.
<Ryanpyan> Hard for me to wake up at 10:00 after that
<bear2229> http://www.mackinacponyco.com/
*TOY_PON3 still wants to draw as good as Wrek
<GarrettBrony> The New Pony episode Should really be called Reading Rainbow
<P0n-3> Watchin' them sleeps!
<CosmicLatte> I be an Arizona bronette.
<Jamey> Fus Ro Yay :D
<Fluttershy13> i go to sleep at 12...i dont handle late night pony watching well! :P
<CountDoofus> Wish I could draw like that... best I can do is a stickfigure
<MasterBrony> thats a llama in the pic
<CosmicLatte> But srsly guise, it just might be Flim/Flam.
<flutteryay> Garrett you win an internets
<shadowdash> same :D
<MasterBrony> -.-
<Ryanpyan> Lol, Im a night owl, so I'm always uplate
<Thunderpony> Who would request that in a live-stream?
<Moop> hello
<sonicxsx> same here
<GarrettBrony> YAy
<P0n-3> Nah it's obviously Celestia.
<Dashie_Dashie> for some reason I had a dream that I could draw like wrek.
<Ryanpyan> up late*
<CosmicLatte> And then where would we be?
<Dashie_Dashie> >.>
<TOY_PON3> Oh I wanted to work on my drawings. I want to get done atleast 2 pics and digitalize them
<P0n-3> I'm sticking with that theory until it's indisputably a llama.
<NovedCheese> Flim&flam.... thats creepy
<Fluttershy13> supposedly "Fluttershy"'s on here
<TOY_PON3> Dashie_Dashie: I did too
<Ryanpyan> I guess I should've said nightpony. Crap.
<CosmicLatte> OH GOD, THE FANFICS THAT COULD HAVE JUST BEEN BORN T_T
<Moop> can any one hear me????
<GarrettBrony> Jordie La Forge + Rainbow Dash Fanfic
<MoscowPony> yep
<Dashie_Dashie> you mean read you?
<Dashie_Dashie> lolwat
<CountDoofus> hiya Moop
<RaveBrony> I think i could draw something decent, but the problem is digitalizing it...
<NovedCheese> Who here a read cupcakes
<bear2229> IM A FILLY AND WHAT IS THIS
<shadowdash> yep, and technically ...damn somone made the joke
<Flare_Force> i've seen that one before. nice pick
*TOY_PON3 cannot hear Moop :P
<kirzstryfe> 1,3the same type of person that asks why he was kicked for asking
<Aquafresh> :)
<CosmicLatte> * <3 's Cupcakes*
<Moop> lol
<MasterBrony> after i read "cupcakes" i now avoid ALL fanfics
<Ichijoe> well Apple make great gear no fooln' and with newer Toys like your Touch the newer iTunes Cloft will be of more use to you Moble Me and all that
<JTDrift> it feels like I'm talking to mself...
<Dashie_Dashie> this molestia drawing is worth staying for.
<TOY_PON3> hey Moop lol
*Dashie_Dashie smirks
<RaveBrony> lol!
<TOY_PON3> ^
<bear2229> you should read progress
<P0n-3> My mind isn't as pure as it should be. When my brain first registered 'pony rides' it made me think of it in a different context than that website intends.
<Flare_Force> if i get a shirt (and i probably will) thats the one i would get
<pony_4193> I draw people better than animals
<TOY_PON3> hey RaveBrony
<Thunderpony> Oh ok....oh...OH! O.O
<NovedCheese> k read the experiments of twilight sparkle
<rainbowHYPHEN> Hey guys, COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE TOPIC HERE.
<shadowdash> hello moop , shup Dashie>:(
<sonicxsx> I bought a RD shirt that says "This shirt just got 20 percent cooler"
<NovedCheese> freaky as shiz
<RaveBrony> Hey TOY_PON3 :D hows things?
<MasterBrony> Molestia is like "twilight, you so sexy when you sleep"
<Moop> what is she doing?
<TOY_PON3> Good, and yourself? :)
<MasterBrony> "now hold still a min"
<TOY_PON3> Moop: DIRTY THINGS
<CosmicLatte> After I read Cupcakes I realized that I had some sort of sick attraction to murder-pony fics and I kept reading them until I read Sweet Apple Massacre. Then I realized how terrible a person I was.
<Dashie_Dashie> "RUN"
<CountDoofus> I probably won't be able to stay until the drawing is finished, so where can I find it after? Does Wrek have a DeviantArt page?
<Dashie_Dashie> http://i.imgur.com/l0YBp.jpg
<Thunderpony> Ponies can be pretty basic to draw depening on your style
<MasterBrony> omg
<Ichijoe> But, for those with older (10+ year old Pods now or getting slowly on there now), have lost nothing
<Dashie_Dashie> yes, give me a second.
<MasterBrony> you actually READ that one?
<CosmicLatte> ..And then promptly discovered Cheerilee's Garden and fell in love all over again.
<RaveBrony> Quite well :) Im going to attempt to draw a bigger version of my Canerlot pony :P
<P0n-3> One of the most inappropriately hilarious things to me is Celestia traumatizing her guards.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Please do not discuss Cupcakes or related material in bronystate channels
<CosmicLatte> Sorry >.<
<NovedCheese> i just read sweetapple massacre that was bad
<Dashie_Dashie> http://johntb.deviantart.com/
<P0n-3> I don't know why that's so funny to me but it just is.
<Wrek> 05my da: johntb.deviantart.com
<TOY_PON3> sweet good luck
<CountDoofus> thanks!
<bear2229> http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6982210/1/Progress if you want to read it
<Ryanpyan> Well, I'm gonna go guys. Gonna maybe watch some eps on YT or something considering that literally every single one is on there
<MasterBrony> ?
<Ichijoe> I calling Lyra and Bonbon!
<rainbowHYPHEN> I'm really bad at art, but I can manage a pony if I spend enough time on it. ^^
<randomname> I think it depends on the pose. Drawing a sleeping pony for instance would be more difficult than drawing one standing up, in my opinion.
<Ryanpyan> Bye
<Dashie_Dashie> Wrek: http://i.imgur.com/l0YBp.jpg
<MasterBrony> @kirzstryfe for a stupid question.....why?
<Dashie_Dashie> got'cha
<TOY_PON3> like i said wanna draw 2 of my OC pony and digitalize it but that is going to be hard as Tom
<Moop> http://images.wikia.com/mlp/images/e/e8/Derpy_DERP!.png
<flutteryay> bye
<sonicxsx> I can almost draw like that... Just need to get pas the stick figures
<RaveBrony> Yeah... :|
<Thunderpony> I guess that's true, you'd have to be good at drawing from your mind for it not to be that big a problem.
<pony_4193> I can do it with a good eraser and enough time. no challenge is too hard with enough preparation.
<shadowdash> lol XD
<Dashie_Dashie> I need a tablet, and adobe illustrator.
<P0n-3> "Whatever you do, recruits, don't volunteer for palace guard duty. If you're selected for palace guard duty, try to stand very still and not be noticable."
<kirzstryfe> 1,3www.bronystate.net/rules
<TOY_PON3> RaveBrony: But we can do it though ^^
<Wrek> 05lawls
<flutteryay> princess molestia?
<MasterBrony> MOLESTIA!!!!
<pony_7680> oh no
<rainbowHYPHEN> Oo
<MasterBrony> lol
<flutteryay> jk
<Thunderpony> Molestia saw me
<otakon> and thus chat died
<NovedCheese> i made this in my free time... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwbtgX_Rvrw&context=C3b3ed3aADOEgsToPDskKGEOABtsY9NAd5AOLyxq3G
<Thunderpony> I'm scared.
<MasterBrony> i read the rules when you gave them to me yesterday
<pony_7680> evil be gone!
<randomname> Suddenly.....Molestia!
<pony_4193> And that should be a lesson for next episode
<otakon> with the making of MUFFINS as it's death knell....
<rainbowHYPHEN> Suddently this pose is concerning me
<Ichijoe> And to the person who watched their first stream you saw perhaps One of the best Eps this whole year baring the Season 2 2 parter A Return to Harmony
<MasterBrony> or rather
<MasterBrony> this morning
<Flare_Force> OH GOD, PRINCESS MOLESTIA??? not what i was expecting
<MasterBrony> but i still am not sure why?
<Thunderpony> It shouldn't
<kirzstryfe> 1,3A number of people do not want to see or hear content with gore, r34, etc. related to ponies
<hawk> I'mtempted to buy the derpy robocop one myself. I already have the LoTR Luna one
<NovedCheese> and this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWYpOk8WNzk&feature=context&context=C3b3ed3aADOEgsToPDskKGEOABtsY9NAd5AOLyxq3G
<pony_9809> When will the episode start?
<MasterBrony> ok
<Tovler> If only Starflash had made bagels
<randomname> Especially if the pony being drawn is Molestia.
<otakon> yes
<Flare_Force> nice
<CloudSabre> wtf is he drawing?
<P0n-3> Also I think the whole Lyra being a humare thing is hilarious.
<MasterBrony> that clarifiys things then
<Thunderpony> I think this is suppose to be celestia caring for twilight
<randomname> But we shall see.
<Ichijoe> what Ep?
<otakon> then maybe it would have lived!
<P0n-3> "Humans Y U no real!"
<otakon> like BOOMER
<TOY_PON3> Okay if anypony can answer. Is there another program to draw instead of Paint but it's FREE?
<flutteryay> it ended already :X (the new one)
<rainbowHYPHEN> I'm sure it is, but that Molestia pic scares me.
<sonicxsx> Molestia?
<rainbowHYPHEN> lol
<randomname> Ah, that would be good.
<MasterBrony> i had a theory the other day.....wanna hear it?
<Zanoab> GIMP
<sonicxsx> God i hope not
<otakon> TOY_PON3: ofc
<Starflash> Bagels, are you mad?
<bear2229> sure
<Gman> twilight sparkle and a alicorn if i had to guess
<Ichijoe> Saturdays @ 9.00AM EST work out you own TZ
<Dashie_Dashie> Next weeks episode should be interesting...
<Tovler> lol, I was thinking of Boomer from PPG
<Fluttershy94> Looks like not
<flutteryay> :'|
*TOY_PON3 takes notes
<Dashie_Dashie> it's a valentines special .__.
<CosmicLatte> *listens attentively*
<pony_4193> Does anyone know when the next episode of The Brony Show is coming? or did they leave all that for much much later?
<otakon> um
<hawk> one pony comforting another? Time will tell
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it's supposed to be a sad picture, it's just not close to done yet
<CountDoofus> is it just me, or is Vinyl Scratch (in fanfics anyway) a sex addict? certainly looks that way
<NovedCheese> OHhh TheOry
<sonicxsx> :D
<otakon> that was from Nostalgia Critic
<P0n-3> I saw this funny comic picture of Lyra at a shelf display full of My Little Human toys, and she was grinning ear to ear and holding a Paul figure. Bon Bon was standing beside her looking very embarrassed.
<CloudSabre> seriously wtf is is he drawing?
<MasterBrony> well...i believe dragons and unicorns and pegasusususus
<Ichijoe> Theirs always Jewtube
<MasterBrony> are real
<otakon> on his review of Independence Day
<RaveBrony> Of course we can TOY_PON3! :$ and I wud like to know an answer to your question too :\
<rainbowHYPHEN> Oh no... hurt Twilight? ;-;
<Thunderpony> Sad? Don't tell me one of them is....dead!?
<Meteor> Celestia knows...
<Dashie_Dashie> inb4 Big Mac and fluttershy?
<Ichijoe> and frankly it's better
<MasterBrony> but if i lived in equestria
<otakon> I love the whole
<flutteryay> what drawing program is that?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3a sad picture
<Moop> http://pushpull.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/arte.jpg
<rainbowHYPHEN> I don't know if I can watch this now
<Dashie_Dashie> lolwut
<CosmicLatte> LOL
<bear2229> but of corse
<kirzstryfe> 1,3adobe illustrator
<Fluttershy94> Hiw I register my nickname here?
<Ichijoe> M$ Paint
<otakon> "BOOMER ........WILL LIVE!"
<Rain> Valentines ep and not a Fluttershy ep. Its official... Fluttershy will never get an ep... ;______;
<MasterBrony> i would be the pony who believed people are real
<otakon> bit
<Flare_Force> speaking of Derpy, who here really thinks Hasbro is going to remove Derpy because some parent thinks she's offensive? I don't... Or at least i HOPE its not true
<CosmicLatte> Sorry, the LOL was for POn-3
<Fluttershy94> *How
<Ichijoe> no M$ Paint and a Waco Pen?
<otakon> that and BLAM
<Moop> RAIN how do u know?
<NovedCheese> :D
<RaveBrony> >.<
<NovedCheese> Same Here
<flutteryay> kk adobe illistrator
<randomname> Is the drawing based on a fanfic or just an original concept.
<Meteor> Dont worry
<Dashie_Dashie> we still have season 3 to look forward too Rain xD
<kirzstryfe> 1,3illustrator with a mouse
<Fluttershy94> Oh god I can't write good today xD
<randomname> *?
<Meteor> They are just some fllying myths
<L> oh, i will worry
<Tovler> Boomer… will live. sqeeeeeeeeeee
<CountDoofus> Then what about The Stare Master?
<P0n-3> Humans probably exist in Equestria but they're not very intelligent and they're used primarily as pack animals and to pull carts and stuff.
<Ichijoe> Your better then me
<Amazon> &4&5 etc
<RaveBrony> They probably don't want to cause/finalize shipping that people do xD
<Rain> in season 2 sillys
<MasterBrony> People are real celestia!!!! why doent anypony believe me?
<flutteryay> w/ a mouse like a boss
<Starflash> Anyways, muffins are good. they should never be the reason for a pony not to speak.
<shadowdash> see ya everypony, i shall return for the re stream of the new ep in 02 and 1/2 hours, but till then Epic brohoofs
<CountDoofus> ah
<fluttercry> 05,15Fluttershy will get season finale.
<NovedCheese> i do....
<kirzstryfe> 1,3not sure, with Wrek it's probably a suggestion or original
<rainbowHYPHEN> *yawn* oh, right, sleep
<Dashie_Dashie> ^
<flutteryay> brb breakfast
<Wrek> 05s3will be all about trixies special adventures
<Rain> I would die happy
<Ichijoe> I can just about draw a line with a Mouse
<P0n-3> The humans in Equestria all work in the salt mines and operate the WHEEL of WOE!
<RaveBrony> Brohoof! (\
<kirzstryfe> 1,3he doesn't do much from fanfiction
<CosmicLatte> I would be the pony who went insane when she realized that we didn't have actual hands but somehow picked things up anyways..
<DainbowRash> How can she be offensive? :/
<MasterBrony> lol
<frakturfreak> btw where was derpy in the new episode?
<rainbowHYPHEN> I guess I should do that. Night everypony!
<MasterBrony> thats good
<rainbowHYPHEN> or... morning
<rainbowHYPHEN> or whatever it is
<Dashie_Dashie> s3 Derpy will become more canon, so will vinyl scratch.
<Talidos> magnetic hooves
<rainbowHYPHEN> for yo
<rainbowHYPHEN> +u
<randomname> Oh okay, was wondering since it was supposed to be sad.
<Ichijoe> So who are they?
<CosmicLatte> But not everything is magnetic.
*Rain just realized who the larger pony is
<TOY_PON3> RaveBrony: Zanoab said GIMP
<MasterBrony> psychic powers
<Gman> well the word derp somehow has some old ties to mental disability i think
<RaveBrony> :o
<CosmicLatte> Unless you're going to tell me ponies eat iron.
<Dashie_Dashie> Rain: MOLESTIA
<MasterBrony> they are ponies
<RaveBrony> I shall look up this GIMP
<Dashie_Dashie> :T
<randomname> Goodnight
<Tovler> So many new nurses today. Now I know how Brock feels
<MasterBrony> they MAKE things magnetic
<CountDoofus> Lauren Faust alicorn, of course *que M. Bison clip*
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Twilight's the one on the ground, not sure who the standing one is yet
<TOY_PON3> fluttercry: I agree
<Ichijoe> Actually that does kinda look like 'tia
<CountDoofus> cue*
<Meteor> Yes it does but i dont think they would take it seorsly.
<Dashie_Dashie> YES.. YES..
<pony_9809> The one lying on the ground is Twilight.
<sonicxsx> Fluttershy NEEDS a new episode
<CosmicLatte> BUT ONLY TEH PEGASUSAE HAVE MAGICS
<Moop> Flutter Shy already kind of had an ep in season 2
<RaveBrony> I reeeeally want to see more Vinyl....
<kirzstryfe> 1,3with Wrek's style it could be anypony
<NovedCheese> I would be the random backround pony who pops out of no where.... aww i forgot thats allready taken
<P0n-3> fetock.\
<CosmicLatte> *brain is now broken*
<hawk> Its likely trolls being trolls
<otakon> oh lord....
<Flare_Force> if people are offended by derpy's voice, saying its offensive to mentally disabled pople then why hasn't anybody gone off on a rant about Patrick Star from Spongebob
<kirzstryfe> 1,3his ponies are long-legged
<P0n-3> Well ponies can hold things in the crook of their fetlock.
<Fluttershy94> OH GOD! Dat music o_O And this drawing...
<P0n-3> Like Octavia holds her bow.
<TOY_PON3> Season 3 will be nothing but Trixie, in order to make Sethisto happy
<MasterBrony> *fixes your brain by adding more ponies*
<Moop> She had a big part in Find a pet song
<TOY_PON3> :P
<Ichijoe> Yeah so much for the Lyra and Bonbon theory
<fluttercry> 05,15wait? wrek uses a mouse?
<fluttercry> 05,15hardcore
<CosmicLatte> Yay :)
<Gman> or goofy
<otakon> it's Celestia
<DainbowRash> lol
<hawk> Good choice of music
<pony_9809> Luna?
<CosmicLatte> Oooooh, awesome cover..
<otakon> fluttercry: you didn't know?
<NovedCheese> Pony hunger games??? what would that look like
<Moop> More Discord
<MasterBrony> ;)
<Flare_Force> and THATS why i think this is a load of crap from some stupid troll
<DerpyisBestPony> I knew this was a Phil Collins Cover like 2 seconds in. xD
<RaveBrony> This is true, she got a song xD
<fluttercry> 05,15no! That's awesome
<DainbowRash> Though I like Phil Collins ver. more
<Ichijoe> More like Molestia
<Fluttershy94> Definity right ;)
<CosmicLatte> Latte-chan wants to know who did this cover o.o
<Meteor> Well you see peoples are stupid in these hard times
<otakon> nah
<P0n-3> I'd be more vexed at having to pick thigns up and use them with my mouth.
<Flare_Force> I am a troll, but Ponies are OFF LIMITS!!!
<TOY_PON3> inb4 Hangover reference
<Meteor> so many stupid things they done
<Nafedude> What did DerpySparklz ask, anyway?
<CosmicLatte> Also, Pony Hunger Games would be so legit.
<hawk> I really need to practise drawing ponies more. Its a pain without a tablet or any digital skills though
<otakon> he wouldn't draw a pic like that
<Meteor> like SOPA >:(
<CountDoofus> AJ still hasn't had her own song
<P0n-3> Thank the Sisters for magic. Your MOUTH! Can you even IMAGINE?
<Flare_Force> NOBODY MESSES WITH MY PONIES!!!
<fluttercry> 05,15Phil Collins is better
<otakon> he draws saucy for sur
<Flare_Force> lol
<TOY_PON3> ^
<NovedCheese> :)
<otakon> but not molestia
<MasterBrony> as a legit question.....is religion allowed in here?
<RaveBrony> Yeah, 2 AJ episodes, and she didnt get to sing xD
<Meteor> :D
<CosmicLatte> Yeah.. *picks up medicine*
<TOY_PON3> :D
<CosmicLatte> *dies*
<Thunderpony> I'm guessing it's better not to know
<otakon> fluttercry: agreed
<Rain> this song is too appropriate Wrek XD
<Sunset_Shimmer> I prefer this version because the vocalist is so AWESOME
<DerpyisBestPony> Will the stream in 2 hours play Read it and Weep? I missed it this morning. ;_;
<Derny> Does anypony know if Read it and Weep is up on youtube?
<Moop> Look my smiley face has a nose! :^)
<P0n-3> Who needs religion? We have alicorns.
*Tovler attempts to compare Adventure Time cancelling Mathematical to Hasbro getting rid of Derpy.
<TOY_PON3> I demand Derpy song
<Meteor> is this the admni drawing?
<CosmicLatte> OH EM GEE GUYS IT TOTALLY IS FLIM/FLAM
<MasterBrony> *revives CosmicLatte with pony paddles*
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it's allowed, but if it devolves into a flame war we'll have to step in and stop it
<otakon> Rain, it's NOT MOLESTIA!
<Flare_Force> I doubt it
<Meteor> admin*
<DainbowRash> I doubt it
<NovedCheese> k
<Fluttershy94> Creator's name (drawing/website)
<Gman> well theres the beggining sequence of the episode
<Meteor> Nope
<Rain> who cares?
<Nafedude> heck, WHEN did she ask it?
<fluttercry> 05,15I find math offensive
<Gman> but thats just a spoiler
<Chex> TWILIGHT
<randomname> Something that mortal eyes were not meant to see.
<Derny> okidoki
<Nafedude> or he
<MasterBrony> it's just i dont wanna hear about "oh lord"
<NovedCheese> what is a pony religion anyway
<otakon> ._.
<Gman> and only 44 seconds long
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPqjKk_xCo
<Moop> I care
<Ichijoe> BTW Molestia is canon since that rarity Ep (sadly I forgot the name of it) :(
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Wrek is the one drawing
<RaveBrony> Woah!! Just spilled Pepsi all over my desk and picked up my drawing Just in time! X_x
<Derny> ty
<Meteor> oh
*Rain cant even make a joke
<TOY_PON3> Dayum
<kirzstryfe> 1,3www.johntb.deviantart.com
<Dashie_Dashie> ninja'd
<MasterBrony> worshiping Princess Luna.....for she is my savior
<pony_9809> Sweet Elite was it?
<Meteor> what is he using :S ?
<Flare_Force> I had found a channel that had EVERY episode... but they were all taken down yesterday
<bear2229> Princess Celestia was originally supposed to be Queen Celestia, as is logical considering her position, but Hasbro requested the name be changed as Disney has caused princesses to be associated with good and queens associated with evil. Princess Celestia is the highest authority, with no king or queen who outranks her.
<Ichijoe> where raritly was kising 'tia's Hoof
<CosmicLatte> Well they keep saying things like "Oh Celestia!"
<Fluttershy94> Is he on deviantART or something?
<P0n-3> Ponies don't need religion, they got magic.
<Flare_Force> I WAS PISSED!!!
<DerpyisBestPony> Will the stream in 2 hours play Read it and Weep? I missed it this morning. ;_;
<kirzstryfe> 1,3adobe illustrator and a mouse
<Ichijoe> yeah
<bear2229> found it on wiki
<Dashie_Dashie> that's totally molestia.
<Dashie_Dashie> I mean.. cmon
<NovedCheese> :)
<Dashie_Dashie> DAT FLANK
<Derny> :C
<TOY_PON3> ^
<P0n-3> When there are two ruling sisters they cannot be queens.
<P0n-3> Two are princesses.
<Meteor> oh thanks!
<RaveBrony> lol!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3the new episode gets restreamed at the end of the movies
<Ichijoe> this season has been full of little things like that
<P0n-3> If one of them leaves or expires, then one is a Queen.
<P0n-3> One would ascend.
<Ichijoe> and then Derpy
<stallion10123> omg
<Moop> lolololol
<CosmicLatte> So when Luna was exiled, she was Queen Celestia?
<Thunderpony> But i'm not mortal, so...something that eyes were never meant to see.
<TOY_PON3> Bow down to the royal ass, I mean plot >.>
<Flare_Force> i was using that channel to download the episodes... My friend is also a brony... but he doesn't get the internet or HUB
<Starflash> Wait wut
<Ichijoe> tham
<fluttercry> 05,15I think this season has been full of things people WANT to be references, but really aren't
<P0n-3> Celestia was not Queen Celestia because her sister was still alive.
<NovedCheese> .....ohh comfusing
<pony_9809> Did you hear that Hasbro might change Derpy's name?
<MasterBrony> princess celestia would "expire" at my hands so Luna could take over
<hawk> seriously thats with a mouse? That's skill right there
<RaveBrony> I get better at body structure and different poses by watching this :)
<P0n-3> She was just the current reigning Princess.
<stallion10123> run away
<Meteor> sad him D;
<CosmicLatte> Ah.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3suggested wrek draw r34 twilight, and he dislikes being asked things like that
<CountDoofus> I watch this livestream for the plot!
<Flare_Force> so i am his only way to see the show
<Ichijoe> thankfuly the 2end half is getting better now
<RaveBrony> ^
<Starflash> ...math is pretty offensive though
<RaveBrony> lol
<DainbowRash> I wish there was more bronies where I live
<CosmicLatte> Good thing we have a resident Obscure Royalty Laws expert..
<MasterBrony> is all going to be here to watch the new ep again?
<Flare_Force> and for now all i have is all of season one
<Ichijoe> Luna's ep totaly sucked
<pony_9809> 20% cooler that is.
<Wrek> 05im hating the pose >.>
<P0n-3> Me? Nah, just a resident of Canterlot. ~_^
<Nafedude> i saw it
<Meteor> Pfff in my country im the only one that is a brony
<NovedCheese> most likely
<Flare_Force> i only know three others
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> who did this version?
<otakon> damn it!
<TOY_PON3> Dashie_Dashie, Rain, and RaveBrony are all making Wrek's sad drawing into something hilarious :D
<CosmicLatte> If I can; my fammy might be leaving before it starts to go hang out with the grands =/
<Moop> http://www.geekalerts.com/u/guitar-solo.gif
<bear2229> probaly
<Nafedude> she seemed to be joking, though
<MasterBrony> can i ask everypony a question after this one?
<Ichijoe> I think they killed Luna for good with that Ep
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> of the song that is
<SweetieBell> hai
<bear2229> sure
<CosmicLatte> Cha
<Dashie_Dashie> :>
<otakon> Project Saturation, TELL US WHO GOT WHAT PARTS!
<P0n-3> NO! I mean, YES!
<randomname> I would hope so.
<Sheepy> Hmmmmm, can anyone think of a good minecraft server name with Brony in it
<otakon> the wait it KILLING me
<Flare_Force> in your country? where you from?
<fluttercry> 05,15That episode was great!
<Meteor> My country is the most unfriendly of all in EU
<NovedCheese> k
<CosmicLatte> I want to know what that random curved line in the background is turning into..
<Meteor> Lithuania
<Dashie_Dashie> project Saturation?
<Gman> i only know 1 other brony my brother who i converted
<CosmicLatte> o.o
<otakon> math is truth
<Meteor> We have bad society
<kirzstryfe> 1,3a wall
<fluttercry> 05,15The worst episode this season is Family Appreciation Day
<Tovler> Mathematical implied that a lesbian relationship could be canon and that AT takes episode-advise or w/e from the fans.
<Fluttershy94> I'm in the EU, too
<otakon> thus, it is offensive
<MasterBrony> did ya'll even read that book on obscure unicorn history twilight got you?
<Fluttershy94> Germany
<CosmicLatte> Oh, okai :D
<GLaDOS> Bronycraft_World 1
<Nafedude> she had this emoticon after it: :D
<GLaDOS> ;3
<pony_9809> Why is that?
<DainbowRash> ditto
<Meteor> Cool :D
<WinterTwister> hi
<Ichijoe> Perhaps I rested to much of my Fanon in that character
<Dashie_Dashie> OH SHI- IT'S GLaDOS
<NovedCheese> yes it sucked
<DainbowRash> but not germany
<Flare_Force> um... is anybody else disturbed by this pic being drawn?
<Moop> The best was the last round up!
<NovedCheese> :)
<GLaDOS> It's me.
<Fluttershy94> ^^
<WinterTwister> did you show the new episode yet?
<SweetieBell> Twilight I dont aprovve of you and this ponie O_O
<Flare_Force> lol
<Nafedude> so i'm sure it was a joke
<TOY_PON3> :O
<Gman> not really
<MasterBrony> i thought it was awesome
<otakon> Tovler: wait, when did a ep of Adventure Time get canceled?
<stallion10123> song goes with the picture
<CosmicLatte> I cherish it every waking moment of my life because she touched it.
<pony_9809> Because of Derpy.
<GLaDOS> And I'm going to kill you.
<Sheepy> Meh, gone for Bronycraft
<fluttercry> 05,15That's why I seperate fanon and canon
<MasterBrony> im going to twilights history class after work
<Meteor> Nope, but i wanna find out what he is drawing :3
<Ichijoe> but, Luna wasn't what I was expecting
<CosmicLatte> I keep it in a glass case to preserve her smell.
<Dashie_Dashie> .__.
<DainbowRash> I thought it's gonna be celestia hugging twi at first
<WinterTwister> Fluttercry?
<stallion10123> lol
<GLaDOS> And turn you all into potatoes.
<Fluttershy94> The next MLP episode here in my timezone at 19:00
<WinterTwister> have you shown the new episode yet?
<fluttercry> 05,15yes I did
<MasterBrony> ^^^^^creepy?
<bear2229> Bon Bon is one of Starlight's friends, who is extremely fond of food and cooking. She dreams of becoming a fashion model and loves to write in her diary, detailing every day's events. Her family is quite large, consisting of four younger siblings (Amber, Twink, Rusty, a 'baby brother' and an unknown sibling), one older sister (Misty), and her parents. In Friendship is Magic, there is a "background pony" that resembles her, but s
<GLaDOS> to eat.
<CosmicLatte> JAYKAY the only thing in my glass case is Pinkie's cider glass.
<Flare_Force> so did i
<kirzstryfe> 1,3even so, Wrek takes his work seriously
<sonicxsx> Well GLaDOS did send a letter to celestia
<fluttercry> 05,15Yes it's been shown

<pony_9809> Why does it say two hours till the saturday stream?
<Flare_Force> but then he/she looked at a picture of Molestia
<Thunderpony> Yeah that i can understand as a fellow artist
<WinterTwister> When I was out jogging, halfway through my route I was like

<GarrettBrony> yay movie night
<RaveBrony> Waait, its a sad drawing? O.o
<Tovler> The episode was fine, it was Mathematical that got shut down. I think fans can still talk to the developers in some other way.

<Flare_Force> true
<CosmicLatte> It's Cetrollia, or Luna.
<NovedCheese> OMG IT IS MOLEstia
<kirzstryfe> 1,3he usually doesn't take requests when he's drawing, just goes down the playlist on his computer
<Flare_Force> we will see
<Thunderpony> Ah
<Meteor> Time will show huh?
<Nafedude> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness

<fluttercry> 05,15ahead*
<CosmicLatte> No, Word From Above says it's a wall.
<WinterTwister> alright, thanks
<randomname> Yeah, taking any requests would be difficult really.
<Tovler> I'm pretty sure it's still in rotation.
<hawk> I use all sorts of crazy references when I'm drawing stuff. Apart from birds, then I only use my own photos
<MasterBrony> so god told you?
<Dashie_Dashie> oh GLaDOS
<Ichijoe> I might have to vote for that being the 2nd best song after WWU too
<WinterTwister> Guess I'll have to catch the new ep later on youtube.
*TOY_PON3 wants Wrek to put on some Marvin Gaye
<Dashie_Dashie> I have a present for you..

<Tovler> Still. I appreciate the transparency. We still don't know what's attacking Derpy
<randomname> That's some cool tricks with that program.
<Flare_Force> it would probably be more devious
<fluttercry> 05,15I've already read up to chapter 20...but 20.5 turned me off of it
<otakon> Globetrotter: the war was horrible for one
<bear2229> BRONIES TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL
<Thunderpony> I think most drawing programs can do this
<fluttercry> 05,15and now I need motivation to finish
<CosmicLatte> *bucks NovedCheese into the Sparta pit*
<MasterBrony> where are 4th wall portals are...the tv or comp monitor

<ofna01> nope
<MasterBrony> damn these truckdrivers making me do my job :P
<Shii> ill take a fellow brony's word for it, but i think its due t the fact that other fans got offended by the name, and also copyright issues
<prince-dari> MW2 > blackops
<ofna01> you got it backwards
<Rainbwdashlover> daring do is awesome but prob cause they dont wanna spoil it
<pony_9809> They probably will after this episode.
<BronyCon> its the goddamned shit on the stream now. iv'e seen this video 90 times.
<emangamer> Ohai prince-dari
<CosmicLatte> Lol

<CosmicLatte> "Sorry, guys, can't stop the arsonists breaking in right now. I'm watching ponies."
<Rainbwdashlover> Ditzy doo is still a cute name though...
<[wub]ehren> once, prince-dari modded me and then kicked me and thought he was trolling me, but really I was trolling him - but he knew of this and was actually trolling me by making me think I was trolling him
<pony_9809> Don't worry. I'll be right beside derpy.
<BronyCon> does anyone have a steam?
<[wub]ehren> and thats how equestria was made.

<Rainbwdashlover> wait how many of you all are boy's and girl? i wanna see how many bronies and pegasisters :P
<Ingwaz> ditzy doo isnt a bad name Rainbwdashlover, the problem is that a small percentage of people complain and thigns are potentially being changed
<FleshEpic> That's a valid excuse.
<Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPfMb50dsOk&feature=channel_video_title here you go.
<Flare_Force> in fact, he would probably laugh

<TheDr> twilight is awsome

<Hazard3> eh twilight is...hard to explain how i feel
<The_4th_Wall> If you can accept being a failiure, you canride through anything
<pony_9809> I'm not really a big fan of twilight. She's sometimes bossy.
<lord_darksun> I enjoy all the ponies equally.
<Sundaysmile> Lord Sunday here
<CloudSabre> Last night I actually had a dream that I was in Ponyville a Pegasus just like Rainbow Dash and I was flying with her it was sooooo realistic I almost cried when i woke up

<Meanwhile> Korso has alerted the lag.
<ElementOfNaivityagai> Twilight is the secret fan favorite. dont tell me you didnt identify with her immediately
<Dashie_Dashie> Shizuka: O U

<Sundaysmile> lol
<sonicrainboomer259> wtf
<RaveBrony> Troll
<The_4th_Wall> Planet things look like eggs
<SayWhat> Spike has a crush on Rarity, don't tell anybody though
<Hazard3> and i was browsing google images under mlp cute and it ruined fluttershy for me
<robokun> no kill like overkill!
<otakon> it TAUNTED him!
<TopHat> Twi is my waifu
<pony_9809> Maybe your right but i still like Fluttershy.
<Cypresswolf> Point blank & still missed O_o
<Pikuseru> my little dashie. D:
<Tovler> I'm a sucker for rotating camera shots
<Hazard3> badly ruined her for me
<Luna> We have plenty of knowledge within our team.. but like I said the problem in our current setup is the content we are streaming... But we do have a solution for that.

<lord_darksun> I think evryone likes fluttershy.
<sonicrainboomer259> he REALLY likes progress
<Dashie_Dashie> It was super effective!
<Meanwhile> As always, My Little Dashie was boring.

<DeadlyDerp3> "Dance with USS!"
<otakon> Luna is the KEY!
<alexxm> we came to rescue luna
<pony_9809> Too late I saw it. But I still like Fluttershy.
<LordDerpington> "I shall now tell you... through interpretive dance!"
<RAWRity> god this kid is slow on the uptake
<MasterBrony> *scree*!!!!
<Hatsune_Miku_Fan> Hazard2 i didnt need to know that
<RAWRity> otakon: no no, memory is the key
<SayWhat> LF enchanter, [enchant weapon: ponyblast] My mats
<Sundaysmile> that is an awesome cutie tat
<Arcane_Flame> The Night Shall Last Forever\
<lord_darksun> I can't believe r34 does it have no shame lol.

<Ghosties> 04I had a proposition
<Hazard3> jk but seriously i dont like trixie much
<TheDr> i just allways loved trixie
<Meanwhile> Best kind of device.
<RAWRity> fluttercry: it's basically a trinket that gets the plot moving.
<LordDerpington> An item whose sole existence is to advance the story.
<Shizuka> 13remember the glowy briefcase from pulp fiction? that's like THE macguffin
<Hazard3> Sypher: ur brave
<Raindrop> I blame aliens
<Arceus-pony> And I am back

<Lawkjaw> easy fix: become a pony furry
<StickySyrup> hello everypony!!!!
<Pikuseru> BOOM!!!!!!!
<Shizuka> 13the alternative is Plot Coupon, which is a macguffin part of a fetch quest "as in, cash in this coupon to get more plot"
<MasterBrony> then we can market it to ALL the bronies and make millions
<The_4th_Wall> NO
<Meanwhile> Hey StickySyrup

<MasterBrony> but why?
<lord_darksun> umm trixe was a showoff.
<Mew> yeah
<TheDr> all she did was put on a magic show and got heckled
<Dashie_Dashie> and now I do the dance of my people!
<Dashie_Dashie> http://i.imgur.com/rXKfR.gif
<LordDerpington> Plot coupon: 50% off plots.
<MasterBrony> wait.....what?
<sonicrainboomer259> an item made by the dark lord,sauron
<otakon> wait
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: if I could get plot from a coupon I wouldn't be here.
<pony_9809> Oh, I thought it was slenderman.
<The_4th_Wall> Real pony or brony
<detour> DAFUQ!
<Mew> poor trixie, showoff is her work
<Sundaysmile> was it any good sticky?
*Tovler replaces all the good guys with MegasXLR characters.
<otakon> first they wanted him dead
<LordDerpington> How'd it go, StickySyrup
<TheDr> ya thats her thing she has a boss magic show
<alexxm> there was a uk meetup where was it
<The_4th_Wall> There is nothing else

<Mew> showoff is how her get money
<StickySyrup> IT WAS GREAT!

<Hazard3> The pony said "Your performace was dissapointing!" and took a rock and SMASHED BOTH THEIR HEADS IN!
<TrixieMuffin> why alive now , they wanted him dead on Tau
<Shizuka> 13that's like the biggest macguffin ever
<lord_darksun> actually I think she'd make a good pyrotechnican.
<sonicrainboomer259> yes
<MasterBrony> *agrees with 4th
<Hazard3> thank u
<StickySyrup> Over 80 people turned up... at a random pub
<Arceus-pony> It is I Arceus thy lord and master(lol)
<Meanwhile> No non image links during the stream.
<TheDr> i feel that she is not like that at heart tho
<Hatsune_Miku_Fan> Help me decide..........
<Shii> my school bronies think shes a bitch
<fluttercry> 05,151 macguffin to rule them all
<pony_9809> And took an arrow to their knees.
<LordDerpington> Eighty!? Mercy be.
<robokun> oops, sorry
<Sundaysmile> where was it held?
<alexxm> where was the meetup
<Dashie_Dashie> pew pew pew pew
<The_4th_Wall> Besides, ponies don't have fur, they have hair
<DatEpicVoice> hhhmmm
<StickySyrup> it was hetic... but so much fun! It was help in Kings Cross, London
<Luna> go ahead Ghosties
<lord_darksun> speaking of witch how many of you play skyrim?
<StickySyrup> held*
<DatEpicVoice> when is movie time?
<Sundaysmile> pity, too far out of reach
<Mew> trixie isnt a bitch
<Tovler> Dammit, you're right. This "Titan" is the only reason to care what about what's happening.
<Pikuseru> http://okayface.com/okay-face.jpg
<Ghosties> 04Since PS seems to be like the facebook for bronies, I was thinking that we could use that as sort of a base point for the forums that we'll be creating soon. As in, since we expect a high number of users it would be neat if they could have their own individualized pages that truly express who they are.
<Hazard3> i want to write a fanfic crossover of Skyrim and mlp where fluttershy gets teleported to Skyrim and she gets shot in the knee by a hunter
<sonicrainboomer259> so,everybody sees the LOTR reference?
<detour> Thay do have fur. FAIL
<Hazard3> they become friends though
<MasterBrony> anypony going to bronycon this year?
<Pikuseru> Yes
<NovedCheese> intresting movie
<alexxm> damn i'm i live in stretham
<firlalaith> it's hard not to...
<Shii> i know but thts what my bronies say at school... haha
<kirzstryfe> 1,3no hurt fluttershy :(
<pony_9809> Noo! Dont let that happen.
<Shizuka> 13you know... it's funny...
<Tovler> Oh snap. it IS Nathan lane
<Pikuseru> wut
<Hazard3> she will be alright
<TheDr> i think she was doing her thing, got mad at being mad fun of so she tried harder and chalenged the mane6 to the fight, let it get to her head and then snipe and snails went at tarded it up
<Shizuka> 13the CGI quality in this movie is pretty low ja?
<JTDrift> get'em team winona!
<Sundaysmile> wat
<RAWRity> yes, leave your lazer gun!
<Hazard3> shes a expert medicinal officer
<MasterBrony> pansies
<Arceus-pony> I think this nickname is better
<LordDerpington> It doesn't mesh too well, no.
<Shizuka> 13and yet Final Fantasy The Spirits Within came out the next year
<Honey_Whistle> What are we watchin?
<Meanwhile> Johnny Quest levels.
<MasterBrony> i would FIGHT THEM LIKE A BRONY
<Billybadger7> I wish i could
<Dken2021> god, he's like jar jar if he was less annoying
<pony_9809> Yeah, I believe your right.
<Pikuseru> Titan AE
<sonicrainboomer259> it was made in 2000
<TheDr> me?
<robokun> now all we need is Treasure Planet
<Honey_Whistle> Ah.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3right now
<Mew> i dont doubt if i see someone saying fluttershy is a bitch
<Shizuka> 13AND Matrix 1 was already out
<MasterBrony> with love and tolerance
<Meanwhile> Liked that movie.
<DeadlyDerp3> "And by the way, watch INDEPENDENCE DAY"
<ElementOfNaivityagai> Sniper and snails?
<lord_darksun> how on earth is fluttershy a bitch?
<MasterBrony> and im saving for bronycon in NY
<Shii> guy at my school hates flutter and pinkie
<Meanwhile> Liked that movie to.
<fluttercry> 05,15matrix 1 was the only good one
<Mew> i dunno
<RAWRity> Shizuka: well, FF didn't try to mix CG and Traditional animation, so It didn't look out of place. Matrix was mostly practical effects.
<pankreas> shizuka, there is a quite epic CGI made scene later on
<MasterBrony> gunna cost me a few thousand
<LordDerpington> It's not so much that the CGI is poor, it's that it's not well integrated into the trad stuff. Iron Giant did it right, this didn't
<Arceus-pony> Just nopony throw a masterball at me
<firlalaith> I liked all three of them
<Mew> i love everypony
<Hatsune_Miku_Fan> ...Should i play Halo: Reach, Gears of War 3, MW3, L4D2, Battefield 3, Motral Kom,bat, Skyrim, or COD 4 on my Wii?
<Shii> his fav is rainbow
<Mew> OH FU THEY HATE PINKIE

<Maid_Discord> 11,01ABsorb
<MelaPonie> today
<Raindrop> so kinda like the 'facebook connect' service websites can use?
*RAWRity throws Dream Ball at Arceus-pony
<The_4th_Wall> Wikipedia confirms

<Arceus-pony> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

<sonicrainboomer259> THE MOVIE WAS MADE IN @)))
<MasterBrony> huh?
<alexxm> throws master ball at areceus pony
<pony_9809> Yeah I hate snips and Snails.
<Tao-mell> stupid SuddenLink
<Hazard3> i read a mlp and iron man fanfic where Tony Redmane and his Girlfriend get ambushed by terrorists and the girlfriend gets speared in the uterous through her flank
<ElementOfNaivityagai> i know. just a fun typo.
<MasterBrony> wikipedia confirms waht?
<Mew> i dunno why, but i like snails design g.g

<LordDerpington> See, it's done pretty decently in this scene, but the Drej look like they're spliced in from another movie.
*IshBestPony is back with chocolate chips and popcorn
<detour> yes
<Mew> snips and snails were the ones to send trixie away
<Ghosties> 04To be honest, I don't care much for social networking ^^;
<MasterBrony> Princess Luna>every other pony
<pony_9809> True that one time.
<RAWRity> Arceus-pony: that has literally no effect.
<Hazard3> Screw Ball is best pony
<Cypresswolf> Stith needs a better VA
<firlalaith> I actually like that effect

<Arceus-pony> Megaman?
<alexxm> this film needs more spiral power
<MasterBrony> so i had to reload the page
<Sundaysmile> This movie needs less lag
<Ghosties> 04If we combine our viewers with your userbase, Raindrop, it would bring in enough numbers to warrant an interconnected web of people that can gather on one large forum and converse on a multitude of subjects and topics while still being able to retreat to their own profile where they can showcase who they are and what they like or whatever
<Hazard3> scared the fucking shit out of me
<TheDr> i felt he was gonna skip rope with someones intestines
<Dashie_Dashie> It doesn't make much of a difference guys...

<lord_darksun> and he could do the same things seogorath could do you know alter reality itself. Which btw is an epic power.
<Hazard3> oh those are Snips and Snails

<Dashie_Dashie> IT'S JUST BEEN REVOKED.

<The_4th_Wall> Your whole life was a fabricated lie so we could project this super-holomap onto the universe. Psych!
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Absorb.
<Athena> Ah... I see I didn't miss much
<Shii> i mean specific ships
<robokun> wait, why does he understand the aliens!?
<Hazard3> Pipsqueak got thrown into a barrel for asking to many questions by Commander Shephard in this other fanfic
<Raindrop> I wouldn't mind sharing the userbase if the users liked to join your forum and it would make it easier for them to do it
<RAWRity> Shizuka: which, considering their touch could kill her...is kinda dumb.
<TheDr> she probaly has a sad past
<Hazard3> funny as hell
<Starflash> flail.
<Dashie_Dashie> This fill needs moar John McClain.
<Ghosties> 04And I'm not sure about the link you posted, though that could work
<MasterBrony> everytime you type, say, or print the word "ponies" the world gets just a little bit better
<alexxm> time for the temper tantrum

<GarrettBrony> Cypresswolf not madness SPARTAAAAA
*Athena hugs Roxsnow back~
<Luna> DCD / Dari do you guys have any ideas we could discuss now?
<sonicrainboomer259> it needs more LOTR references

<Meanwhile> Space creeping.
<The_4th_Wall> Want to talk; PM me

<Raindrop> any ideas what forum software you're going to use?
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: cannot unsee.
<GarrettBrony> needs more MAGIKS
<Tovler> Nathan Lane should have dressed in drag and done the hula.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3yeah, first time I saw the movie was probably 4-5 years after it came out lol
<Flare_Force> well, trixie probably gets thrown out of every town she goes to for bragging too much, so yeah she probably does have a sad past
<Shizuka> 13luau!
<Arceus-pony> This guy seems like a dick
<sonicrainboomer259> wheres wrek
<Arceus-pony> Is he a bad guy?
<lord_darksun> I haven't read any pony fanfiction really.
<TheDr> like she lost her parents or something so she had to act all strong
<Dken2021> and you just happen to have a pic of paula deen ready, why?
<[ger]Brony1> Somepony will get it when they are back on the ship.

<Tovler> That was a The Birdcage reference, btw.
<Pikuseru> pwned
<DatEpicVoice> that is what happened with me and harry potter

<ElementOfNaivityagai> the only good thing to come out of cupcakes is that reading that Frindship Is Madness did
<MasterBrony> i have it already
<Tao-mell> oh dur
<Shii> someone made an animation of cupcakes
<Billybadger7> This reminds me of dark matter from jak n daxter
<MasterBrony> LOL
<Meanwhile> Sounds like a good idea Shizuka
<Hazard3> Flare dont do that
<TheDr> i like comidy fun some sad and normal
<Mew> the fandom is scary
<pony_9809> Ew,
<JTDrift> its weird to see such a blend of excessive rotoscope and excessive cgi
<Tovler> so it stops zapping him?
<Tao-mell> yeah, Harry Potter's awesome
<Maid_Discord> 11,01At least this isn't a 3D film.
<Shizuka> 13he's a true scientist
<Billybadger7> like tree
<Hazard3> theres no need to discuss that
<Dashie_Dashie> them lightsaber sound effects.
<Hazard3> now
<Tao-mell> but the books will always be better
<Arceus-pony> Quick jump in the portal and get rid of the bowser sub!
<Dken2021> >advance alien race
<lord_darksun> well I'm a fan but not like that.
<alexxm> that was disgustinly easy

<TheDr> party inside?
<Shii> how about muffins
<Hazard3> its a shipping fic of Rainbowdash and Pinkiepie
<MasterBrony> ?
<Luna> I believe we were talking about PHPBB as forum software because it's highly customizable
<TheDr> awww
<pony_9809> What's that.
<detour> arrow404: knee not found
<sotha> They definitely don't fit in with the aesthetic of this movie.
<fluttercry> 05,15so...you can just walk out of prison?
<TheDr> i like some shipping
<Hazard3> very well written barely any shipping
<DeadlyDerp3> ....Why was she resting>
<Mew> i has watched the animation instead of Fic. Now i will stop to talk about cupcakes
<Billybadger7> it usually ponifys what i type
<Meanwhile> One does not simply walk out of prison.
<Dashie_Dashie> Boink
<pony_9809> I like food.
<Tovler> she broke out of her coffin too.
<RAWRity> fluttercry: pretty much.
<TheDr> but i always so rainbow with soarin in my head
<GarrettBrony> I guess the dredge didnt count on have prisoners that were not made of enery
<Shizuka> 13the drej are a pretty lenient society
<Flare_Force> my friend said cupcakes are gay muggins... but muffins are the fruity ones
<Hazard3> omfg

<Tovler> Never trust american-made blue prisons
<Morty> those guys suck at forcefields
<Arceus-pony> What is their beef with humans?
<Shii> no muffins are bald cupcakes
<RAWRity> Shizuka: if by lenient you mean inept
<sonicrainboomer259> CUE SAURONS EYE
<lord_darksun> what is that thing?
<NewDCD> well, my ideas are a much bigger project so it might be something that'd be better to discuss in a later date
<Hatsune_Miku_Fan> What game should I play, Halo: Reach, Gears of War 3, MW3, Battlefield 3, L4D2, Mortal Kombat, Skyrim, or CoD4 on the Wii?
<Hazard3> TheDr: Butterscotchsundae am i right?!
<Hazard3> that guy is amazing
<pony_9809> Muffins are fruity?
<Morty> how did such dumb guys ever blow up the earth?
<Sundaysmile> Human's are a threat to them

<Lawkjaw> i wonder what those alien's anatomy are like
*IshBestPony hugs everypony and then noms everypony
<Sundaysmile> hence why he broke out so easily
<deathfire365> why is it that everyone wants to kill us
<GarrettBrony> RED SPY is in the base
<alexxm> our population went over a million
<Shii> my favorite is banana nut
<kirzstryfe> 1,3giant energy cannon
<Randomnerd> Drej are pretty much Ringwraiths
<Flare_Force> YES
*Athena hugs IshBestPony and noms back~
<Tao-mell> I think it's because they're energy based life forms
<TheDr> butterscotchsundea is that a fan fic?
<pony_9809> Halo.
*ekips is learning the Drej language now
<alexxm> hax
<Arceus-pony> Are the drej the typical racist alien species?
<Shizuka> 13stupid humans with their carbon based bodies and corporeal form
<Randomnerd> They even have the blackspeech
<Dashie_Dashie> Matt damon is thinking with portals.
<fluttercry> 05,15some of the effects just seem..off. like, it's not bad. but it just looks out of place
<Hazard3> dude Hatsune_Miku_Fan u cant play half those games on the wii
<Flare_Force> ME GUSTA BANANA NUT MUFFINS
<Morty> and they suck at locking their ships
<pony_9809> Your right.
<RAWRity> seriously, I can't take those guys serious as enemies knowing that 2 fingers is all you need to break through their walls.
<Billybadger7> Penises. penises everywhere
<Dken2021> >advance alien race
<pony_6458> did I miss the show?
<Tao-mell> and humans are solid mass, so they can go through it
<MasterBrony> it's simple, first we kill the human species.....
<Sundaysmile> apparently they're just trying to save themselves
<Shii> BEST. MUFFINS. EVER.
<Hazard3> no TheDr hes a very good fanfic writter
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: what if you have no fingers? DOOMED.
<Shizuka> 13well rawr... they did kinda break our planet
<Dken2021> >simple aircraft controls
<TheDr> ohhh
<RAWRity> fluttercry: that's the biggest issue. the CG isn't integrated well.
<Billybadger7> Then batman
<pony_9809> Really?
<Morty> and they never thought of that?
<GarrettBrony> dumb flank alien race is more like it
<MasterBrony> yes

<GarrettBrony> De Magiks happen now
<IshBestPony> Krull foar B movie
<Pikuseru> Dredge says "OH SHI-"
<pony_9809> Vlad Plasimus.
<Nova> and that is how you beat some aliens and make some friends
<CloudSabre> RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW DASH

<Shizuka> 13eeeeyup, ice rings could totally make a rock planet
<Lasharus> Why not? It wasn't too bad a film.
<firlalaith> I saw this one in theaters, but treasure planet, I've only seen the beginning of that one at my dentist's office
<Lordlandraid> Oh, come on. Really?
<Shizuka> 13with magma

<Ghosties> 04Has to be sometime past 5 PM EST
<Shizuka> 13and have enough left over to make water
<Meanwhile> In which case she's just...ignoring Bronysate?
<MasterBrony> yep

<Ictiv> You can take my word on that.
