<Dman> 0prince-dari is it bed time? or watch more? what do we do?
<CallingCthulhu> I don't actually watch Torchwood, since it more or less takes out the fantasticalness of Doctor Who and replaces it with Jack, but it has a few good episodes.
<Altair> down towards charlotte, people lost power for a month
<Chimera> Didn't they? X3
<Altair> and we had no school for around a month

<prince-dari> And making it all crappy.
<CallingCthulhu> Haters gonna hate, etc.
<Dman> 0yea angels ruined
<prince-dari> And Matt Smith.
<JohnMadden> 0indeed. that was shitty.

<prince-dari> MFW they never explain how the Doctor gets out of the Pandorica.
<Dman> 0scootaloo plushie on ED : D
<CallingCthulhu> Actually, it's scientificlly impossible that it would be 'the same rain'.
<prince-dari> It's so poor.
<Dee_Twenty> So if I took a hammer and chisel to one of these angels and carved myself a weeping pegasus, would it send me to Equestria?
<TTG> They explained it
<prince-dari> Maybe they'll explain it later.
<TTG> it was just wibly
<prince-dari> No they didn't, he just automagically got out.
<mib_eirdop> http://www.clamtxt.com/?r=28048
<TTG> He went back to before he got out after he got out to tell them how to get him out
<Dman> 0what is that mib_eirdop?
<CallingCthulhu> 'They're all pirated.'
<Dee_Twenty> Amazing, it's almost as if the writer forgot all about why it was a bad idea for Rose to fuck around with the past in Father's Day.
<Dman> 0>all those years ago. >5 minutes. ;_;

<prince-dari> Actually. :P
<CallingCthulhu> OSCAR MOMENT.
<TTG> Life's a piece of shit, if you look at it
<Dee_Twenty> The full saying is "Life's a bitch and then you marry one, and if you're lucky she'll die first." :p
<jpony> are you saying we shouldn't look at it
<Dman> 0IMPOSITION PART 6 GUYS YES! my 3rd fave fanfic!
<prince-dari> I think that's probably an expansion on the original Dee_Twenty. :P
<braindrainer> IF that happened to me I would find myself and cause a universe destroying paradox. I'm old anyway, I don't give a fuck.
<jpony> didn't Lil Wayne say something like that (sorry)
<Dee_Twenty> No clue, who's Lilly Wayne?

<Dman> 0haha
<Dman> 0durr?
<Dee_Twenty> Except for the whole thing where Rose nearly destroyed the universe by saving her father, that kind of supports the idea that it's supposed to be a linear progression, otherwise it wouldn't have nearly destroyed everything.

<Dman> 0Ty, c ya jpony
<Dman> 0lol c ya today
<jpony> XD
<TTG> night yo
<prince-dari> I could get my mic.
<Dee_Twenty> >Only pony who has not seen nor has any desire to see Inception.
<Dman> 0>night. O U
<TTG> karaoke?
<TTG> Eh, ot
<jpony> drop the beat
<CallingCthulhu> Also, tommorow is DnD Night.
<Dman> 0Bai Bai
<TTG> It's pretty good, Dee
<prince-dari> Lawl, if you want karaoke.
<TTG> It'a not as mind-fucky as people say it is
<TTG> but it's a very good movie
<CallingCthulhu> Lordkat's Stream :D
<Dee_Twenty> It sounds like a Matrix knockoff.
<TTG> haha
<jpony> windowception
<TTG> not really
*eXAKR tosses NightSeas into the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator
<eXAKR> It really depends
<TTG> It kind borrows a few elements, but it's not much simlar
<TTG> AWESOME
<eXAKR> But yeah
<CallingCthulhu> My Wing-Wang is acting all funny now.
<eXAKR> Opera sucks in some aspects
<TTG> I wanna drop a penny down the hole
<prince-dari> It's not anything like the matrix to be honest.
<eXAKR> They add too many features few people need
<prince-dari> And it's a pretty good film.
<prince-dari> Matrix is better though.
<prince-dari> :P
<eXAKR> And they don't seem to pay enough attention to things that need to be attended to
<CallingCthulhu> It's all weird.
<eXAKR> Like colour profiles
<jpony> uh what movie are we talking about
<NightSeas> 12I always thought the interface is simple o-o
<TTG> Eh, Matrix has a lot of nostalgia going for it
<CallingCthulhu> My Wing-Wang.
<Dee_Twenty> >Disliked the Matrix trilogy. Especially disliked Keanu's pasty white ass.
<TTG> Matrix really isn't that complicated and the acting isn't fantastic
<jpony> let's watch Pokemon episode 1 herp derp
<prince-dari> Keanu is awesome.
<prince-dari> And he's a really nice guy.
<prince-dari> In real life.
<TTG> *ignoring sequels*
<CallingCthulhu> HOW'D IT GET BURNED
<CallingCthulhu> Sorry.
<TTG> Yeah, he is
<jpony> Keanu is sad.
<Dee_Twenty> Yeah, saying the Matrix is better doesn't fill me with the urge to watch Inception.
<eXAKR> Opera's?
<CallingCthulhu> I'm more of a Nic Cage fan.
<jpony> oh okay we're talking about Inception
<NightSeas> 12Yeah
<jpony> doi
<Dee_Twenty> He may be a nice guy, but it doesn't improve his acting.
<CallingCthulhu> Nic Cage is AWESOME when he plays screwed up characters.
<TTG> So, it's probably better than the Matrix, if you don't think the matrix is perfect
<TTG> VAMPIRES KISS
<TTG> YES
<TTG> I'M A VAMPIYAH, I'M A VAMPIYAH, I'M A VAMPIYAH
<eXAKR> Opera's interface can be made very very complex if you know how to mess with the customisation
<NightSeas> 12True
<jpony> threat has been detected
<prince-dari> If I saw Inception on TV I'd probably think meh.
<jpony> jesus christ how horrifying
<TTG> A stream within a stream within a stream within a stream within a stream within a stream within a stream within a stream within a stream within a stream
<TTG> 324545 levels
<prince-dari> Since I'd already seen it and once you've seen it I don't think there's much rewatch value.
<prince-dari> Where as if I saw the Matrix on TV I'd HAVE to watch it.
<Dee_Twenty> The only roles Keanu has ever gotten right was in the Bill and Ted movies, and in the remake of the Day the Earth Stood Still, the latter of which he nailed because it called for him being an alien being completely devoid of the ability to display human emotions, so basically himself.
<prince-dari> I'd be compelled too.
<TTG> Kind of like the terminator being the perfect part for Arnold
<Dee_Twenty> Exactly.
<NightSeas> 12Also, did you hear about the new Motorola Triumph Virginmobile is going to be offering?
<NightSeas> 12http://www.virginmobileusa.com/cell-phones/motorola-triumph-phone.jsp
<jpony> heh are you looking at Pokemon
<TTG> pokeporn
<Dee_Twenty> He can't really play humans though, not unless they're stoners.
<jpony> mwahaha
<TTG> Well, like, that's, y'know, your opinion, man.
<Dee_Twenty> Or maybe psychopaths, Keanu could probably make a good psycho killer.
<jpony> dat theme song
<NightSeas> 12The fact that Virginmobile is going to be offering Motorolas is pretty awesome
<TTG> BUM BUM BUM
<Winter-Puff> =D
<Dashite> I WANNA BE THE VERY BEST
<jpony> i will travel across the land
<eXAKR> Hmmm?
<jpony> searching far and wide
<jpony> dun dun dun
<prince-dari> I didn't see anything wrong with his acting in the Matrix.
<Dee_Twenty> What acting?
<jpony> i know kung fu
<prince-dari> >_>
<TTG> Everyone was a little stiff in the matrix
<jpony> Gary MotherFUcking Oak
<prince-dari> Whatever.
<prince-dari> You guys have weird opinions.
<prince-dari> Like 10th doctor not being best when he clearly is.
<jpony> his acting is fine I guess
<braindrainer> Ah yes, the show that teaches kids to forget about school, travel the world by themselves, catch wild animals and use them to fight other people
<NightSeas> 12lol You know what a Motorola is right?
<prince-dari> And Matrix not being great which it clearly is. :P
<TTG> I hear an echo
<jpony> dat Pokemon Blue opening
<prince-dari> Pokemon Blue <3
<TTG> Matrix is a classic, but it's a little overrated
<prince-dari> Those were the days.
<TTG> and Tennant is indeed amazing
<jpony> green pokeball FTW
<TTG> but the other guys have their moments too
<braindrainer> ONIX IN DA HOUSE!
<jpony> 1998 man
<jpony> good times
<prince-dari> >10
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<jpony> >implying that I was alive
<prince-dari> Running around on his own at 10.
<Dee_Twenty> Anypony else ever notice that Gengar and Clefable share the same base body?
<TTG> And now that I'm 10, I can LEAVE HOME
<jpony> Ash should be like 25 by now
<jpony> Milf.
<prince-dari> MFW Ash is apparently 8 or something in the latest series.
<drf|laptop> 03Why is that surprising
<drf|laptop> 03motorola makes phiones
<TTG> lol, Dragonball GT
<drf|laptop> 03*phones
<drf|laptop> 03not baby manaphys
<braindrainer> When my kid turns 10 I'm gonna buy him a lizard and kick him the fuck out
<jpony> mfg Robin Williams plays Professor Oak in the live action Pokemon movie
<prince-dari> LOL
<jpony> mfw..
<jpony> dat title card
<TTG> I jews chew
<prince-dari> There's a...Live action...Pokemon movie?
<Dee_Twenty> Parents are useless in this series, really who lets their ten year old children wander around with FIRE BREATHING MONSTERS?
<jpony> I choose you... ADRIAN ANDREWS!
<TTG> XD
<jpony> great judges of character
<NightSeas> 12lol
<jpony> o hai Dodrio
<NightSeas> 12Because Virginmobile is pre-paid
<TTG> IF you extinguish a charmander's tail, it DIES
<prince-dari> I so hungry.
<drf|laptop> 03so?
<jpony> Gary's hoes
<prince-dari> Now I know how Sprinkles feels.
<drf|laptop> 03they have Samsung phones, why not Motorola?
<Dee_Twenty> And that's just in the old games, it's even more ridiculous after Diamond and Pearl where they face FUCKING GODS.
<jpony> remember when Mew was God
<TTG> GARY-SAN TO YOU, BITCH
<jpony> Gary's balls
<NightSeas> 12That'
<Dee_Twenty> Remember when we thought EV's were a glitch? XD
<NightSeas> 12Kind of what I was saying
<braindrainer> Gary always got the bitches
<NightSeas> 12that's*
<jpony> remember how Mew was under that truck
<TTG> NEPOTISM
<jpony> good call TTG
<TTG> He was totally wasted
<jpony> Ash got high this morning
<prince-dari> MFW Oak is banging Ash's mum.
<jpony> MFW Oak is Ash's dad
<prince-dari> Gary and Ash are half brothers.
<jpony> yesh
<TTG> Why's he got those empty balls laying around?
<TTG> Didn't the kids take them?
<prince-dari> I'll TAKE IT!
<jpony> its Pokemon I ain't gotta explain shit
<prince-dari> Aidsemon I choose you.
<Dee_Twenty> http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/158/5/4/gummy_origins_by_csimadmax-d3ibjj8.png Totally relevant.
<TTG> D'awwwww
<TTG> lol, gummy
<jpony> haha Dash
<jpony> PUNNY
<TTG> As expected, you balls are tiny
<jpony> is that Tracey's clone or something
<jpony> Mexican cousin
<eXAKR> Ah
<TTG> That'll be good for, what, two days?
<prince-dari> I'm a big kid now!
<TTG> I AM a big pony.
<CallingCthulhu> Fuck you Ash. I AM YOUR MOTHER AND YOU WILL OBEY ME.
<prince-dari> INB4 everyone is banging Ash's mum.
<jpony> a week later Ash died of starvation in the Viridian forest
<braindrainer> yeah, all ten year olds can take care of themselves in the wild
<prince-dari> Including Pikachu.
<TTG> RETURN
<TTG> You gotta say return
<jpony> fire the laser
<braindrainer> That's not even how you get them to go back inside
<Dee_Twenty> I remember back when Pikachu was actually cute instead of being an annoying little rodent that Ash clearly used a Game Genie on.
<CallingCthulhu> One question, where did Ash get his basic education?
<TTG> EVERYONE DIED
<jpony> what level is Pikachu now
<jpony> 200
<TTG> 244
<CallingCthulhu> There aren't any schools.
<Dee_Twenty> >Implying Ash graduated Pre-K.
<Dashite> 9001
<CallingCthulhu> heh.
<TTG> He needs to change his underwear now >>
<jpony> ah yes the rubber gloves
<CallingCthulhu> Yes.
<Dashite> This the first episode?
<prince-dari> D'aaaawwwww, pikachu.
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<TTG> I like how Ash sounds a little like Rudolf
<TTG> Yes
<NightSeas> 12Anyways, how was your day drf?
<prince-dari> Somehow Ho-Oh appears in the first episode.
<braindrainer> Pikachu is an ass
<drf|laptop> 03fine
<prince-dari> Even though it doesn't exist yet.
<drf|laptop> 03and about to be over, I'm about to go to bed
<Dee_Twenty> "Fuck you stupid human, you're destined to repeated failure at the Pokemon League EVERY. FUCKING. TIME!"
<TTG> Foreshadowing
<jpony> I am your master obey me
<NightSeas> 12Same here XD
<Dashite> Ah, the only episode that actually happens, with everything else being a coma dream.
<CallingCthulhu> What kind of stupid mom would let their kid wander around a country which has wild abominable monstrosities walking about the countryside?
<SilverSonic> Same.
<braindrainer> He dosent have a high enough badge to control pikachu yet
<CallingCthulhu> Unless this was a plot by Ash's mom to get him killed.
<CallingCthulhu> Yeah...
<TTG> He doesn't have enough badges to control the level 21231231 pikachu
<CallingCthulhu> That's canon.
<jpony> hmm..
<Dee_Twenty> Nopony would blame her.
<NightSeas> 12 I think everyone is finally borking xD
<TTG> I WONDER
<CallingCthulhu> Durrrr, Raichu
<braindrainer> CHARAZARD
<prince-dari> I like the episode where Ash dies.
<TTG> SHIT
<prince-dari> Then leaves his body.
<TTG> I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKITUNG
<CallingCthulhu> FOREVER
<CallingCthulhu> Ash is a greedy bastard.
<jpony> why didn't Ash catch a Pidgey and then evolve it into a Pidgeotto instead of catching a Pidgeotto fill out your damn Pokedex kid
<Dashite> It was obviously snorlax
<CallingCthulhu> POACHER!
<jpony> the hat flip back it's on now
<TTG> HOLD B
<CallingCthulhu> Catching a wild bird who never did anything to you. What a bastard.
<jpony> press down on the D pad
<Dashite> lol hold B
<CallingCthulhu> How is Pikachu staying balanced?
<Dashite> I remember doing that....
<eXAKR> yuu.
<jpony> set up some traps..
<TTG> Now bash it over the head and catch it
<Dee_Twenty> Man, I remember back when this was the coolest thing ever... for all of a few months.
<Dashite> Sandstorm.
<braindrainer> Trolle'dex
<jpony> I don't really watch the show anymore but I still play the games
<Dashite> Hate that move.
<TTG> RA TA TA
<jpony> even the new ones
<Dee_Twenty> The new season is actually pretty good.
<jpony> purplest rat
<TTG> XD
<jpony> Top percentage Rattata
<Dee_Twenty> Team Rocket got an upgrade to badass ninjas.
<braindrainer> hahaha, Poke'dex is trollin
<Dashite> I haven't played a pokemon game since the first generation.
<CallingCthulhu> Ash is a dumbass.
<CallingCthulhu> >:V
<jpony> I have seen some episodes but I never wake up anymore
<TTG> I played the hell out of Silver, and not much of any other
<Dee_Twenty> Jessie kicked Pikachu's hacked ass with a FLYING TYPE.
<jpony> Spearow is evil
<CallingCthulhu> It's not very nice.
<Dee_Twenty> It was glorious.
<jpony> dat monochrome
<CallingCthulhu> Hey, it's self defence! Ash attacked it for no reason, it's perfectly reasonable that it would fight back.
<braindrainer> Spearow is jelly
<prince-dari> Jealous yet don't want to be cought.
<prince-dari> caught*
<TTG> Trainer envy?
<prince-dari> wut
<jpony> am I the only one who has played all the generations
<Dee_Twenty> Mmm, Spearow jelly.
<TTG> SPEEEEE ROOOOW
<NightSeas> 12Good night everyone
<prince-dari> I played everything before black/white, and HG/SS.
<Dashite> Ash about to get owned.
<TTG> Pikachu: Fuck yes.
<braindrainer> sandshrew, mankey!
<Dee_Twenty> I've played them all, though if they don't do better with the next gen that might change.
<braindrainer> Don't remember there being so many different poke'mon outside the starting city
<Dee_Twenty> Black and White is the first generation where I honestly can't stand even one of the starters.
<prince-dari> Dildo?
<TTG> I kinda like the Pig
<jpony> no the pig sucks it s a repetitive type combination
<TTG> I reminds me of p-chan from Ranma
*jpony is being pedantic
<jpony> hello Misty
<braindrainer> A kid you gonna follow around for the next few years
<jpony> when did you get here
<Dee_Twenty> I can't look at it without thinking I'd rather have the original fire/fighting, Blaziken.
<Dashite> Charmander > other fire starters
<TTG> lol, a hospital that says "We hope to see you again"
<braindrainer> Nigga stole mah bike
<TTG> ded
<jpony> sadface
<Dee_Twenty> The water starter would be awesome if they used the bipedal stance they've shown in some of the artwork wielding its swords.
<braindrainer> If pikachu had just attacked the pidgey like ash wanted in the first damn place, none of this would have happened
<TTG> And I. AM. TAALKING.
<Dashite> Sunglasses Squirtle
<Dee_Twenty> Instead it ends up looking like some hideous otter/unicorn abomination.
<jpony> goddamn it's thundershock and it's super effective use it already
<TTG> Think of every black day I ever STOPPED you
<TTG> And then
<jpony> dat BGM
<TTG> AND THEEEN
<prince-dari> Bam
<TTG> Do the smart thing. Let someone else try first.
<prince-dari> Owned.
<Dashite> Ash got owned.
<jpony> and Ash is still in a coma
<Dee_Twenty> You know, comparatively speaking to a lot of the seasons since, this first season was actually really well written.
<TTG> Yeah, I like it
<jpony> good old 4kids
<prince-dari> Random Ho-Oh.
<TTG> Ho-Ohly SHIT
<jpony> foreshadowing..
<Dashite> lol
<braindrainer> FAR foreshadowing
<jpony> they showed a G2 pokemon legendary in the first episode of the first season hot damn
<Dee_Twenty> We've really hit rock bottom when we've got fucking ice cream cone Pokemon. >_<
<prince-dari> We should watch the episode where James has boobs.
<jpony> I'm down
<braindrainer> then ash gets his ass kicked by misty
<jpony> SONIC RAINBOOOM
<prince-dari> Chandelier pokemon too.
<TTG> The story of a ten year old boy and his enormous yellow taser mouse
<jpony> and then they banged
<jpony> where is the Pokerap
<jpony> waarghlbarghl
<TTG> Polkamon, Polkamon, everybody Polkamon
<braindrainer> ok, I got to get some sleep. Catch you all later.
<Dee_Twenty> You know, next generation they should really toy around with Pokemon that have conflicting types, like fighting/flying, or fire/ice.
<jpony> peace out
<jpony> will there ever be a light type?
<TTG> FIIIRE AND IIIIICE
<jpony> the answer:no
<TTG> I want my Bug eevee
<Dee_Twenty> I always assumed psychic was supposed to be the light type.
<jpony> ground eevee
<Winter-Puff> they have a bug/fire if that counts
<jpony> so dark beats light that's kind of depressing
<jpony> i think psychic is just a mental thing
<jpony> look at me fanboying
<Dee_Twenty> Unless you're one who believes darkness isn't inherently evil or light good.
<jpony> hmmm
<jpony> is there an electric/ice type
<TTG> Darkness was originally meant to be evil
<TTG> like, shadow, or oni, or something
<Dee_Twenty> Hrm, I can't think of any, there are a few water/electric though.
<jpony> what about Ghost where does that fit in
<jpony> yeah Lanturn is good
<jpony> never had a Lanturn in my in-game party tho
<jpony> is this that clip
<Dee_Twenty> I'd like to see more Pokemon with typings like Lantern, two opposing types.
<jpony> fire/water
<TTG> I raised a shiny lanturn once, it was green
<jpony> would be cool
<TTG> It was a Green Lanturn *trollface*
<jpony> "steam" Pokemon
<jpony> mmm Japanese opening
<Dee_Twenty> Pinkie Pie = Ultimate Green Lantern.
<TTG> How humiliating for Sinestro
<TTG> defeated by streamers
<prince-dari> MFW buffering.
<jpony> whose dress is this
<Dee_Twenty> Pinkie Pie knows no fear, and with her mind she'd be the most unstoppable ring slinger ever.
<jpony> Professor Oak and his bitches
<TTG> UUUUUUUUU

<prince-dari> 3rd time.
<prince-dari> Wow.
<TTG> everybody slide down the survey poll
<jpony> I read that earlier
<Dashite> Again?
<TTG> When they hacked the white house?
<jpony> Ah this is nice having only a few people. Not having chat flying every split second
<jpony> yeah you buffer that episode Dari
<TTG> watch pmvs

<TTG> Haha

<TTG> Al
<TTG> And my silencer was on~
<jpony> the interrogation fits this well
<TTG> This is done so well XD
<Dee_Twenty> I can't be the only pony not surprised in the least that Hannah Wisconsin or whatever poor state she abuses by associating herself with it has effectively crashed her career already.
<prince-dari> ?
<jpony> not surprised but how did she crash it
<prince-dari> Who crash what?
<TTG> hopelessly trying to be sexy
<jpony> Hannah Montana
<Dee_Twenty> That and the whole Asian eye thing.
<jpony> this sponge is 20% cooler than other sponges.
<TTG> OOGHOHOHHOHH
<jpony> this woman's so excited
<TTG> This woman... is out of her mind.
<Dee_Twenty> I don't get it...
<prince-dari> Wow, it does look pretty cool.
<TTG> And now she's... the Joker.
<TTG> ...Approaching orgasm.
<jpony> omigosh omigoshomigosh
<jpony> well that was kinda huffy
<TTG> wtf
<TTG> XD
<prince-dari> LOL
<TTG> Huffy the magic sponge
<prince-dari> Tenacious D.

<TTG> XD
<prince-dari> I'm the devil I can do what I want
<jpony> my mooustaache
<Dashite> Wait what?
<Dashite> Deactivated lasers with his dick?
<TTG> Inorite, they're chicks
<jpony> I'm guessing I should add pick of destiny to my list of movies to watch before I die
<prince-dari> Yeah, that's in the film.
<TTG> It's pretty awesome, J
<jpony> Your resistance only makes my ponies harder
<jpony> taste the rainbow
<TTG> MOTHERFUCKER
<jpony> YEAAAAH
<TTG> ooh, pinkazoid
<TTG> damn

<jpony> yes
<TTG> I can
<Dee_Twenty> Timotei, Timotei, Timoteeei!
<prince-dari> Ok, good.
<jpony> Misty is a girl? OMG
<prince-dari> Wut
<TTG> hm
<jpony> the pink is hard to read
<prince-dari> Not sure if trolling
<TTG> Misty's pretty bad
<jpony> well that's what they're saying
<jpony> or at least Dumbash
<Dee_Twenty> Watch moar Lucky Star if you don't get the Timotei joke. :p
<jpony> are there subtitles
<jpony> cuz can't see
<TTG> They're named after a samurai or something
<jpony> I know the Timotei
<TTG> Gah, that's a terrible voice @ meowth
<TTG> Then again, Meowth had the best english voice
<jpony> Maddie Blaustein forever

<prince-dari> PAEDOPHILE!
<TTG> ERO-JIJI

<MidnightStar> Oh god, not this episode
<prince-dari> XD
<jpony> just run away guys
<jpony> are they really saying crappy
<TTG> I though she was naked for a second =\
<MidnightStar> I saw this episode as a little kid on a local tv station
<TTG> buuuu
<jpony> wow they recognized them holy shit
<prince-dari> MidnightStar: It isn't aired anywhere though?
<TTG> Because they're just in uniforms, not disguises
<prince-dari> Apparently it's been shown only twice in the US.
<jpony> I think I saw it back in the day
<TTG> Despite it disguises just as much as the average disguise
<jpony> but I'm pretty sure they cut "that scene"
<prince-dari> With the James scene removed.
<MidnightStar> LOCAL TV station, they got shut down a few years ago
<MidnightStar> The bewbs part was there when I saw it
<TTG> TO THE SUN
<jpony> disguise/uniform same thing
<prince-dari> So it was in Japanese?
<MidnightStar> With subtitles, yes
<jpony> they showed it with subs in the U.s.?
<jpony> also I don't remember Misty being a waitress
<jpony> but maybe that's just my bad memory
<MidnightStar> It was a local tv station, they pirated most of the stuff they aired
<jpony> and/or sexual repression
<TTG> Shit that's a big bird
<TTG> I forget how disproportionately huge these animals are sometimes
<jpony> lol pwnd
<prince-dari> Wut
<TTG> lol what
<jpony> BASTARDS.
<prince-dari> Those bastards?
<TTG> "Those bastards!"
<jpony> I think they bowdlerized the American version
<jpony> there are swears in the original
<TTG> Or saying "THOSE BASTARDS" in the japanese equivalent isn't as offensive as saying it in english is
<jpony> evolve your Pokemon damn it
<jpony> yes that too probably
<Winter-Puff> well it was dubbed by 4kids
<TTG> usually it's just "TIMEEEE"
<jpony> there is a baseball player named Antonio Bastardo
<jpony> best name ever
<prince-dari> >I'll explain later
<prince-dari> LIES
<prince-dari> HE'S SHAGGING YOUR MUM
<TTG> oak ends sentences with -ja

<jpony> oh shi-
<Dee_Twenty> I wonder if Pikachu tastes like bananas.
<TTG> In this episode?
<TTG> Pikachu tastes like yellow.
<jpony> lemons

<MidnightStar> Gary MOTHERFUCKING oak
<TTG> Shit
<TTG> the guy gets all the hoes
<TTG> Guy's Beiber
<MidnightStar> TROLOLO
<jpony> hohoho
<Dee_Twenty> I love how Ash never even gives Gary, Misty, or any of his other old friends so much as a moment's thought in the newer seasons. -_-
<MidnightStar> aaayEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<jpony> amnesia
<prince-dari> Gary's a friend?
<MidnightStar> no sleep
<jpony> well he becomes less of an ass over time
<prince-dari> Oh.
<TTG> only maniacism
<prince-dari> I never watched that far.
<Dee_Twenty> Gary's a "friend" wink wink, nudge nudge, say no more, say no more.
<jpony> i didn't really either i just read on bulbapedia
<MidnightStar> He wasn't as much of a douche after johto
<jpony> just as planned
<prince-dari> Is it just me or does Gary intentionally show off to Ash to try and impress him?
<jpony> dat BGM
<jpony> he's clearly obsessed
<TTG> DAT BUFFERING
<prince-dari> MFW buffering again.
<MidnightStar> Buffering

<jpony> more pony PMVs
<MidnightStar> MY LONGTIME RIVAL
<jpony> eeyup
<Dee_Twenty> Like I said, he's a "friend," wink wink, nudge nudge, say no more, say no more.
<jpony> mfw Youngster Joey is the champion in Pokemon Generation 6
<MidnightStar> Has anybody else read memories of days long past?
<TTG> about time Hot Topic got pony shirts
<TTG> FiM is right up their alley
<Dee_Twenty> Ew, Hot Topic.
<jpony> I bought some Donkey Kong juice there once
<jpony> that sounds wrong
<TTG> I know, I know, but they're the kind of people to sell PPG shirts, etc
<Dee_Twenty> So is Spencers.
<MidnightStar> Hot topic also doubles as an exotic sperm bank
<TTG> Don't have one of those
<Dee_Twenty> We need to get Pony shirts at Walmart.
<jpony> that would be nice
<jpony> but it'll be a while
<TTG> I would totally get a 3 luna moon shirt
<Dee_Twenty> Walmart rules the world, therefor once ponies have infiltrated every aisle of Walmart we will be one step closer to world domination.
<jpony> wahaha
<prince-dari> We don't even have Walmart over here. :P
<TTG> WAT
<MidnightStar> I want a rainbow dash why wub woo shirt
<prince-dari> Though Waitrose is owned by Walmart.
<jpony> in Britainland
<Winter-Puff> isnt asda also
<prince-dari> I doubr ir.
<prince-dari> it*
<Dee_Twenty> >Implying anypony cares about Britain for the purposes of world domination. :p
<TTG> <3 @ baby big mac
<Winter-Puff> thought it was though could be wrong
<jpony> was Granny Smith ever young
<prince-dari> They wouldn't own two competing supermarket companies I would have thought.
<Dashite> Why not?
<TTG> I've seen fanart of young granny
<jpony> yes FANart
<prince-dari> >implying I give a damn about America being converted. :P
<Dee_Twenty> It's actually a sound business tactic, if you own both competing companies it doesn't matter which people shop at you still profit.
<Dashite> Lots of companies around here own competing brands. They tend to use them in different markets.
<TTG> the hell is this?
<TTG> oh, lol
<jpony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAPXj-yVGLc
<Dashite> On the other hand we also have Future Shop/Best Buy which can at times be found literally right across the road from each other.
<prince-dari> Well I know Waitrose is owned by Walmart, I'm fairly sure that's the only one though.
<Dashite> And you get people storming out of one, only to buy stuff from the other.
<prince-dari> I've not heard of any others being owned by Walmart too.
<Dee_Twenty> >MFW Target is getting exclusive rights to both two different Pinkie Pies and the Luna toys and I've never even seen a Target. :(
<Dashite> "Asda became a subsidiary of the American retail giant Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, in 1999"
<prince-dari> Hm.
<prince-dari> We don't have Target either.
<Dashite> Never seen one here either.
<Dee_Twenty> How do they expect me to complete my Pinkie Pie collection when only Target will carry the last two I need?
<Winter-Puff> nor have i
<prince-dari> Oh, I got it wrong then.
<jpony> do you have Dunkin Donuts
<prince-dari> Waitrose isn't owned by Walmart.
<prince-dari> Just Asda.
<prince-dari> Meh.
<Dashite> :p
<jpony> I shoulda got those McDonalds ponies
<MidnightStar> You can probably find it on Ebay or amazon, Dee
<prince-dari> jpony: No.
<Dee_Twenty> Yeah, but you pay like twice the price. :(
<Winter-Puff> i know when to keep my mouth shut ^^
<jpony> unfortunately I didn't find out about ponies until they were almost done selling
*jpony has no ponies
<prince-dari> MFW we haven't and probably won't ever get McDonald's ponies.
<prince-dari> Or any other pony merchandise. T_T
<MidnightStar> I found a mcdonalds twilight sparkle in a gutter once
<jpony> that's sad
<Dee_Twenty> I got my McDisgusting's Pinkie like two days before they stopped carrying them. I kind of regret not getting the Cheerilee though.
<prince-dari> WUT
<TTG> haha, pinkie
<jpony> remember when noone knew who Cheerilee was
<TTG> XD
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Dee_Twenty> I got a regular Cheerilee at Walmart the other day though. Hasbro y u no get Cheerilee's cutie mark right?
<TTG> I have a bubble pinkie and the normal flutter
<Dee_Twenty> The toy has one of the yellow smiling flowers and then two small burgandy flowers with no smiley faces.
<MidnightStar> I long for the day when hasbro releases a pony set that gets the ponies right
<prince-dari> LOL
<TTG> dat bgm
<prince-dari> Penis joke?
<jpony> rockin
<Dee_Twenty> The sad part is it even has a picture of Cheerilee with the proper cutie mark on the back of the package.
<jpony> lol fail
<TTG> wtf

<jpony> Pinkie Pie is best pony.
<TTG> <3 pinkie
<MidnightStar> Can I buy your soul
<Dee_Twenty> I also have the special Spring Fluttershy.

<MidnightStar> It looks like she's threatening me
<jpony> eeyup
<MidnightStar> "If you go to sleep I'll kill you"
<Winter-Puff> she sure is
<jpony> that's the idea
*Dee_Twenty wants to hug Luna.
<jpony> indeed
<Dashite> "Can't sleep, Luna will kill me."
*Dashite rocks back and forth
<jpony> earthquake episode/porygon episode

<TTG> Sound of Sunlight, that was the one
<MidnightStar> please no porygon episode
<TTG> that one awesome Octavia fanfic
<Dee_Twenty> Has the earthquake episode ever even been shown in Japan?
<jpony> I don't think so
<Dee_Twenty> Would anypony even have a copy of it to upload then?
<jpony> not me
<TTG> Not I, said the dog
<prince-dari> "The episode didn't even end up as a DVD exclusive.
<prince-dari> "
<prince-dari> It's never been released.
<jpony> dun dun dunn
<Dee_Twenty> That's what I thought.
<MidnightStar> Such a shame
<jpony> I really wish they weren't so sensitive over earthquakes
<jpony> I mean they're natural disasters they're not going to stop anytime soon
<jpony> but I guess I understand
<jpony> they haven't even used the attack in the show since that episode got banned
<Dee_Twenty> Eh, I can understand delaying an episode for a few weeks after an earthquake, but I can't understand never releasing it at all.
<MidnightStar> Ponies the anthology?
<TTG> I dunno, I think you can find the offending scene on youtub

<Dman> Dermathil! Sathi!
<Dman> Oh yea we saw some Dr Who earlier Dermathil
<Dermathil> ah
<Dermathil> nice.
<Dermathil> I'm starting to think that putting CUBE forward if I win the lottery wouldn't be the best use of the win. I'm thinking of Blade Runner now.
<Sathi> 7Hello Dman, Hello Dermathil
<Sathi> 7How are you all today?
<slurrymoon> I am feeling nostalgic...I am thinking of Milo and Otis
<Sathi> 7How come?
<Dermathil> I'm here. And hi Sathi.
<Sathi> 7wb ;)

<Dermathil> If I get picked we watch Blade Runner.
<Sathi> 7Good choice
<Sathi> 7and as B?
<Dermathil> CUBE
<Dermathil> Cube's my choice since movie night #3
<Dermathil> and I certainly am not dropping it.
<Dermathil> I'm a big Sci-Fi fan.
<eXAKR> !espeon !glacymr
*Espeon now belongs to eXAKR for 11 minutes
*Glacymr now belongs to eXAKR for 7 minutes and has to fly eXAKR around until then
<Dermathil> I'm the kind of guy who could also suggest 2001 as the A movie.
<Sathi> 7as long as it's not 2012...
<Dermathil> nope.
<Sathi> 7the horror! the horror
<Dermathil> exactly.
<Dermathil> the special effects were nice though.
<Sathi> 7yea but the storyline is meh
<Dermathil> yep
<Dermathil> that's what happens when you use a fad as the basis for the story.
<Sathi> 7fad?
<Dermathil> Something that everybody was tripping on for a short period of time. (2012 apocalypse)
<Dermathil> The Day after Tomorrow was a much better Apocalypse movie.
<Dman> So 3 hours till the show starts?
<Dman> I wonder if there'll be a preshow today
<Dermathil> hopefully there'll be.
<Dman> Yee
<Dermathil> Do any of you know that The Day after Tomorrow is?
<Dman> also
<Dman> fad: An intense and widely shared enthusiasm for something, esp. one that is short-lived and without basis in the object's qualities; a craze
<Dman> I have the limited edishun DVD with a ... 3dpopart thingy cover
<Dermathil> ^^ aka what some thing the ponies are when they are sadly mistaken.
<Dermathil> nice Dman. did you like that movie? (TDAT)
<Dman> Welp, yea it was pretty good, but ocean should freeze not submerge new/york >_< my geog teachter DESTROYED it when it was voted as movie-to-watch-at-end-of-year
<Dman> in terms of realism lol
<Dman> now, 2012 was a comedy, i swear
<Sathi> 7I'm sure there will be a pre-show, just don't know what yet :)
<Dermathil> Moar Snatcher?
<Dman> hey Dermathil Blade runner aired yesterday in UK ^^
<Dman> on BBC
<Dman> Sathi as a mod can you stream anything whenever you want? :P
<Sathi> 7Well i'm not a streamer (yet) maybe in the near future
<Dman> http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511X1QYW91L._SL500_AA300_.jpg cover's holographic : P
<Dman> Sathi - you have to be appointd steramer?
<Sathi> 7oh dear god...
<Sathi> 7Well streaming also depends on connection / pc setup.. Some modponies would be unable to stream
<Dman> : /
<Sathi> 7Also preparing dinner so if i'm a little slow.. you now know why :)
<Dman> I remember applying for a mod, around the time RainBroDash did too.
<Dermathil> nice, Dman. (both the cover and the airing)
<Dman> =]
<Sathi> 7Did you use the e-mail adress or the webform?
<Dman> Yea, I applied for mod, and one of the questions was these 3 NSFW pics, and what you would do. I think I was too soft, and that's why i didn't get any further ;(
<Dermathil> and being I'm in North America I don'T have access to the BBC. (which I know does awesome documentaries)
<Dman> For what, sathi?
<Sathi> 7when you applied for becoming a mod, i'm just wondering
<Winter-Puff> couldnt you use the iplayer on their websiter dermathil
<Dman> oh, I applied via email, then was taken HERE for some PM interview
<Dman> with ghosties and hipster_brony
<Sathi> 7yea I had that too
<Dman> How'd it go for you?
*Sathi 7points at her color
<Sathi> 7I think it went good
<Dman> I mean, did you get a second interview? or an email saying 'ur a mod'?
<Dermathil> winter-Puff: I didn't know they had an iplayer.
<Dman> Demrathil I thought BBC iPlayer was UK only?
<Winter-Puff> ahhh
<Sathi> 7Hmm after the interview they pretty much told me
<Winter-Puff> well they do
<Dman> http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00plcmt/Blade_Runner/ try to access this see if it works : )
<Dermathil> Dman: I don't know nothing about their iplayer.
<Dman> try the link >_<
<Dermathil> nope not available in area
<Dman> Sathi - oh ok. did you say oyu'd kick / ban for any of the pics?
<Winter-Puff> ahh sucks
<Sathi> 7yes
<Dman> I just wanna know what I did to not be a mod : / and try and apply again in like a week. I've been here since pretty early on continuously and wanna be a mod whaaa~~
<Dman> I'm also nearly always the first to go 'no colour u silly' or 'this is what we're watching: blablabla' when somepony asks >_<

<Polarfire> 0what pics?
<Dman> and I made the pic you now see in paint : P and posted it here. Silverscreen was there
<Dermathil> yeah, I was around when that happened. I was among those saying it needed less lines.

<Dman> so I microsoftpaint'd it up and silverscreen used our design : D

<Dman> Bene
<Dermathil> still alive has lost its charm due to being so goddarn overused. Want you gone brought that charm back
<Dman> Portal is a very good game. Portal 2 is a very good game.
<Dman> Dermathil yup
<Dman> or rather, eeeeyup
<Dermathil> I'm thinking P2 is gonna be GOTY 2011
<Dman> Eh i don't know
<Dman> still got many games to come ; )

<Bane> I just beat Portal 2 yesterday
<Sathi> ah there you are. can you tell me how I update the BMN page on facebook?
<nickstr> the on air audio sounds clean
*Dman has yet to memorise the want you gone lyrics. Opinion, Dermathil?
<Dermathil> Even with COD8 and Resistance 3 and Skyrim and all the big games I am looking forward to getting.
<SirSprinkles> You just post on it. Now that you're admin it automatically converts any post you make there to a post by Brony Movie Night.
<SirSprinkles> Just make sure to sign your posts.
<Dman> COD8 won't win GOTY i personally very enjoy cod but it's not original enuf since cod4 to win goty
<Dermathil> Dman: I don't know all of em perfectly. But I do remember the main parts.
<Dermathil> TAKE IT!
<Dermathil> Dman: I know.
<Dman> resistance 3 is good looking but not that great. skyrim ... i played 1 hour of the 3rd one and was killed for accidentally nudging a cup in a bar.
<Dermathil> but its gonna sell alot.
<Dman> RAGE
<Dman> yea it will
<Sathi> hmmm I wanted to update the mod avatars
<Dman> it's sad it's overrated
<Sathi> but could not do it yesterday
<Bane> hahaha
<Dermathil> That'S what I'm counting on!!!
<Bane> I know
<Dman> due to it beeing overrated you have durr youtube comments everywhere about how the game sucks. it doesn'tfff suck!
<SirSprinkles> Mod avatars?
<Bane> I accidentally picked up a candlestick
<Dman> it's just not THEBESTHIGNEVER either
<Sathi> yea in the pictures section

<SirSprinkles> Hmm... don't know why that didn't work for you...
<Dman> *dies* huh. this is elderscrolls. heh heh. what?
<Dman> yea Bane, that's why i didn't play more
<Dermathil> Dman: it isn't overrated. It is a good nobrainer. Like many of the movies that use special effects as selling points.
<Dman> i should play them again soon to try it
<Sathi> as I dont see any admin tools at all
<Bane> And I always end up killing 7 guards and fleeing town
<Dman> I guess dermathil
<Sathi> or buttons

<Dermathil> yeah, Dman. Though he usually gets the models before they are taken off the shelves.
<Dman> oh so cheaply ^^
<Dermathil> Sprinkles, if I win the lottery we watch either Blade Runner as A movie or CUBE as B movie.
<Sathi> neither do I :(
<SirSprinkles> 6Should be fixed now.
<Sathi> checking
<Dman> Yea Dermathil you keep saying CUBE and i keep saying - its reall good : D
<Dermathil> yeah
<SirSprinkles> 6Why can't I hold all these buffers?
<Dermathil> it is a mindbender.
<Dman> funny story - i found cube on a livestream, downloaded it and 2 and 3, and with a friend during maths we watched them
<Sathi> yep just got a notification
<Dman> kept asking our teacher about hypercubes xP
<Dermathil> hehehehehbeheh

<Dermathil> I prefer the original
<Dermathil> it introduced the concept.

<D_man> dsnesmith so far doing quite well in quiz ^^ just done the curses one. twas too easy
<HyperMetalLugia> Hey Espeon
<DSNesmith> the trivia ones are easy
<Dermathil> I also remember hearing that the show wanted to have Weird Al doing a cameo in an episode. No news after that. Maybe it is top-secret that he's gonna be a one-episode-character like Trixie or Gilda...
<DSNesmith> but I failed at some of the RL ones :(
<Lakorv> Australia?
<Espeon> 06~

<Dman> wut
<Dermathil> RANDOMCEPTION
<Dermathil> hahah
<Silverscreen> WE HAVE TO GO RANDOMER!
<DSNesmith> speaking of ceptions
<Dman> yup?
<Dman> oh the button?
<DSNesmith> is sprinkles still modding himself x infinity
*Silverscreen has finally seen inception.
<Dermathil> *puts links to the randomizer in the randomizer*
<Dermathil> did you like it Silver?
<Dman> question 8 - mfw i haven't lucid dreamt yet ; __ ;
<DSNesmith> ololol there he goes
<Hipster_Brony> 8BRRRRRRRRRRRM
<DSNesmith> oh god I had a dream last night
<Dman> SPRINKLECEPTION
<Dman> EBRBRBRBRBRBR
<DSNesmith> I was getting a lifeguarding license or something
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://inception.davepedu.com/
<Silverscreen> It was good.
<DSNesmith> and there was this huge party afterwards
<Dman> dsnesmith was it pony?
<DSNesmith> and pinkie pie was the host
<Dermathil> Silverscreen: one of my top 2010 movies.
<DSNesmith> it was totally rad
<Dman> hipster_brony http://yeahbutton.com/ forl ater use ; )
<DSNesmith> there was pink everywhere
<DSNesmith> cupcakes and pastries
<Dman> : / i want a dream
<Hipster_Brony> 8Zecora theme song here
<DSNesmith> Mrs. Cake even showed up
<Silverscreen> The beginning was waaaay too damn fast for anyone to pick up on unless you were 100% focused on it.
<Zecora> thx
<Silverscreen> But after that, it was great.
<Dman> was it tail twitching for pinkie falling stuff? that's what i put
<DSNesmith> @silverscreen that's why you watch it a hundred times :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol, i meant the character XD
<DSNesmith> I've seen inception way too many times now
<Dman> same
<DSNesmith> it's like holy grail, I can say the dialogue along with the actors now
<Dermathil> Silverscreen: I actually understood everything of the plot since my #1 movie reviewer said to listen to the plot.
<Dman> i've never seen holy grail ... yet : p
<DSNesmith> Tell me, mistah cobb... how wouldyoulike to go home?
<DSNesmith> you can't fix that! nobody can!
<Dermathil> The dream is collapsing...
<eXAKR> Minnet: What's the time in AST?
<Minnet> eXAKR: The time is currently 13:13:42 AST, Sat 2011-07-23.
<Hipster_Brony> 8BRRRRRRRRRRRRM
<DSNesmith> JUST LAK INCEPSHUN
<Dman> 'mistah cobb has a job offah' 'whakindalik a work placement' 'not exactly'
<DSNesmith> Saito's accent is so great
<DSNesmith> Ay bought de airline. Eet... seemed cleaner.
<eXAKR> Minnet: What's the time in AWST?
<Dman> DSNesmith do u think that inception was a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within ?
<Minnet> eXAKR: The time is currently 01:14:22 AWST, Sun 2011-07-24.
<eXAKR> Minnet: What's the time in AEST?
<Minnet> eXAKR: The time is currently 12:14:34 EST, Sat 2011-07-23.
<Silverscreen> The only thing I don't get about the movie is...DID SAITO GET OUT OR NOT?!
<eXAKR> Hmmm. oO
<Dermathil> You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, Darling. *pulls_grenade_launcher_out*
<DSNesmith> I think the level where Michael Caine's character exists is reality
<Silverscreen> Dermathil: My favorite line. :D
<Dman> Dermathil YES
<Dman> YES YES
<Hipster_Brony> 8of course he did silver
<Lakorv> what?
<Lakorv> ow
<Lakorv> I just realised
<Lakorv> sorry, I'll fix that bug.
<ValtheJean> they made it ambiguous to make it seem like they were being cool and artsy
<Dman> but was it all a dream guys? SERIOUSLY i rewatched it a few days ago and grandfather says -come back to reality. and the
<DSNesmith> to "seem"?
<DSNesmith> christopher nolan IS cool and artsy
<Lakorv> she just sees A"EST" and thinks EST.
<Hipster_Brony> 8agreed
<Dman> old people who come there and dream is their reality and the guy in charge sais to Leo 'you can hardly talk' 0_o
<Dermathil> I'd hate to see it out of control.
<ValtheJean> well then he certainly failed to impress me with that movie :P
<DSNesmith> @Dman, I thought he was still dreaming at the end when I saw it the first time
<DSNesmith> but upon rewatches
<DSNesmith> I've concluded he woke up to reality
<Axel_Foaley> Oh Black Luster Soldier and MLP, no one must ever know of our forbidden love.
<Dman> DSNesmith i thought he was awake but upon rewatches now believe it's all a dream so he inception's 4 times
<Dman> lol
<Silverscreen> Black Luster Sodlier? The Yu-Ghi-Oh card?
<DSNesmith> I was half expecting him to get shot in reality and wake up to Mal
<DSNesmith> I've heard some really crazy theories though
<Dman> THE BAMBOOZLED CELTIC GUARDIAN 'i'm so bamboozled'
<Dman> dsnesmith tellm e about it
<DSNesmith> like, Saito is sent into a dream to rescue Cobb from his delusions
<Dermathil> Dman: it can be interpreted as a dream or as reality, since the spinner seems to fall.
<DSNesmith> by Mal
<DSNesmith> and he orchestrates the entire plot
<Dman> it wobbles a little dermathil yea
<Lakorv> Minnet: reload time functions
<Minnet> Lakorv: I reloaded time.lua.
<Lakorv> Minnet: reload commands
<DSNesmith> it was very convoluted I don't remember all the details
<Minnet> Lakorv: I reloaded the command files.
<Lakorv> Minnet: what's the time AEST?
<Minnet> Lakorv: The time is currently 03:17:23 AEST, Sun 2011-07-24.
<Lakorv> :>
<Dman> it deserves ANOTHER rewatch : P
<DSNesmith> and then of course there's the purgatory theory
<Lakorv> you were right and I guessed right.
<DSNesmith> that one is silly though
<Dermathil> Dman: in the other dreams it doesn't wobble at all.
<Axel_Foaley> Great Mouse Detective
<DSNesmith> but the Saito theory
<Silverscreen> The spinner falls throughout the movie, so he isn't in a dream. :/
<DSNesmith> has the entire team representing Cobb's psyche
<Dermathil> Saito: I bought the airline. It seemed neater.
<Silverscreen> That's the whole point of the spinner.
<Dman> the spinner wobbles alittle at the ending but never collapses
<DSNesmith> @silverscreen
<DSNesmith> the way a totem works
<DSNesmith> is that it has different phsyics than normal objects
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<DSNesmith> so the person who's dreaming will make it act like a normal item
<Dman> yea
<Silverscreen> To make it unique to the holder of the totem, I get that.
<Dman> but person woh it belongs to knows
<Lightumbreon> 06back from party
<DSNesmith> if it acts oddly, you're not in someone else's dream
<DSNesmith> yes
<DSNesmith> if you're in your own dream
<DSNesmith> your totem is worhtless
<Dman> cuz only u know what it SHOULD ACTUALLY do yea
<DSNesmith> also this song = disney furry porn
<Dman> what dsnesmith said
<Dman> wut
<SilverSonic> LU, TUNE IN NAO
<Elky> oh, hi silverscreen
<DSNesmith> go watch 'let me be good to you' on youtube
<SilverSonic|Live> http://radionintendo.com/listen.m3u ;D
<DSNesmith> it's disney furry porn
<DSNesmith> no joke
<Axel_Foaley> So the whole thing was Mal's dream?
<Dermathil> The problem is that Cobb's totem, everybody knows that it does. Which is to spin and topple.
<Aristeo> Oh i didn't make it in time >_
<Dman> lol seen it bfore dsnesmiht
<Aristeo> >_>
<DSNesmith> I don't think so, I think she's dead
<DSNesmith> but anyway
<DSNesmith> totems
<Lightumbreon> 06already?!
<Lightumbreon> 06one hour early!
<DSNesmith> let's use the chess piece as an example
<Axel_Foaley> I don't even remember the mouse being hot in that movie.
<Dermathil> I better get a shower before Jaws
<DSNesmith> Ariadne mods the chess piece to always fall one way, and to not roll
*Dman is listening to DSNesmith while enjoying fine wine
<Silverscreen> You know what it SHOULD do, but if he was in the dream, he would have been able to keep it from toppling over throughout the movie. THat's why he holds the gun while he spins it. If he keeps it spinning, he shoots himself to wake up.
<DSNesmith> but only she knows the proper weight
<Dman> quite
<DSNesmith> so if she's in someone else's dream
<DSNesmith> she doesn't actually have her totem
<Espeon> 06I'll tune in in 20 min or so .p
<Sathi> 7red orwhite?
<DSNesmith> she has that person's image of her totem
<DSNesmith> and it will behave by the DREAMER'S physics
<DSNesmith> not hers or reality's
<Dman> Sathi red or white?
<SirSprinkles> 6FUKKEN ARISTOCATS
<Dermathil> Arthur: PARADOX.
<DSNesmith> so the chess piece will act like a normal one
<DSNesmith> instead of her special modded one
<Sathi> 7wine ;)
<Dman> yes
<DSNesmith> for another example, Arthur's die
<Axel_Foaley> Isn't it easy to gauge the weight of something?
<DSNesmith> will fall randomly
<DSNesmith> because the dreamer doesn't know it's loaded
<DSNesmith> that's the thing, Axel
<Dman> Oh right me! Sorry Sathi, I meant I was enjoying DSNesmith's talk
<Elky> >implying white wine is worth your time
<Dman> BUT
<DSNesmith> they're specially weighted
<Dman> Red wine always. white only for big dinners
<DSNesmith> to be AGAINST expectations
<DSNesmith> okay and this is the weird one
<Dman> on its own, has to be red Sathi : )
<DSNesmith> the top
<Dermathil> IMDB is such a good place to find movie quotes.
<DSNesmith> the reason it never falls
<Silverscreen> Exactly. My totem would most likely be a little wolf.
<Sathi> 7good choice ;)
<DSNesmith> is because the dreamer doesn't know the weight of the top
<Axel_Foaley> An Architect can make everything except carpet convincing to the brain.
<Dman> Dermathil i have IMDB opened on black dynamite quotes
<Elky> very good dman
<Dman> Sathi well what would you go for? : P
<DSNesmith> so the physics of the top are basically in limbo, no pun intended
<Sathi> 7red of course
<Dermathil> Silverscreen, are you going to make movie trivia? (or are you still on a dial-up?)
<Hipster_Brony> also, obligatory: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmHAqgAFt6E
<DSNesmith> so it spins forever
<Dman> I could find movie trivia if anyone wants ^_^
<Dman> This is good stuff DSNesmith : )
<DSNesmith> yeah I did research on this :P
<DSNesmith> because the movie was so confusing but amazing
<SirSprinkles> 6Duh.
<Elky> do aren't you a mod anymore silverscreen?
<Dman> yes
<Silverscreen> I'm still running on dialup.
<DSNesmith> okay here's a crazy one for all of you
<DSNesmith> the kicks back up the levels
<Dman> i have like 4 bluray movies only, and Inceptions one of them
<DSNesmith> the way that saito's aging works out
<DSNesmith> because hey, if Dicaprio was in limbo just as long as Saito
<Dermathil> darnit. When will you be able to do movie trivias again Silverscreen?
<Dman> DSNesmith how do you mean?
<DSNesmith> he should be old in the intro too, right
<DSNesmith> so get this
<DSNesmith> he's down in limbo with mal, fischer, and ariadne
<Dman> listening
<Ziltoid> Hello brownies
<DSNesmith> saito is lost somewhere down there too
<SirSprinkles> 6Wow, the thread got buried really quick.
<DSNesmith> he kills mal
<Sathi> 7Hello Ziltoid
<DSNesmith> but she stabs him
<DSNesmith> so he's bleeding out
<DSNesmith> the kick comes
<Ziltoid> um whats this?
<DSNesmith> Ariadne takes Fischer back up
<Dman> sup Ziltoid : )
<DSNesmith> the hospital explodes
<Dman> yes
<Dman> yea
<Dermathil> alright, showertime
<DSNesmith> waking up ariadne, fischer, and the guy who's name I forget
<Dermathil> cyall in about 20 minutes.
<DSNesmith> damn what's his name
<DSNesmith> the cool british guy
<Dman> C ya Dermathil
<DSNesmith> anyway
<DSNesmith> they all wake up
<Dman> I too should shower soon
<DSNesmith> but this is the neat part
<SilverSonic|Live> kk Xeli
<DSNesmith> that level ceases to exist
<DSNesmith> because no one is awake in it
<Dman> hmm yes
<Dman> so....
<DSNesmith> so now we've got level 1, 2, and limbo
<Dman> . . . . FUCK
<DSNesmith> okay, the elevator explosion goes off
<Dman> DSNesmith WOW
<DSNesmith> they all wake up except saito and cobb
<DSNesmith> level 2 disappears
<DSNesmith> level one
<Hipster_Brony> >is on /oat/
<DSNesmith> they're in the car underwater
<DSNesmith> they all get outside of it except cobb
<DSNesmith> cobb bleeds out in limbo
<Dman> yea
<DSNesmith> he shoots back up to level 1
<DSNesmith> then drowns in the car
<SirSprinkles> 6I know.
<Dman> but lvl2 and 3?
<DSNesmith> meanwhile, saito ages down in limbo like 50 years
<SirSprinkles> 6But it got like, no replies. =/
<DSNesmith> 2 and 3 don't exist anymore
<DSNesmith> no one awake in them
<Dman> DSNesmith this is incredible
<DSNesmith> notice how they left someone awake on each level
<Silverscreen> There are four levels, though.
<Dman> sec i'm saving this in notepad!
<Ziltoid> inception?
<DSNesmith> limbo is a variable level
<Silverscreen> Top level which is the city. Second level is the hotel, third level is the hospital, and fourth is Limbo.
<DSNesmith> limbo is the level that is n+1, n being the number of constructed worlds made by the architect
<Dman> k got all that on notepad so far
<Hipster_Brony> threads like that usually dont
<Dman> Yea DSNesmith
<DSNesmith> so if they'd made two levels
<DSNesmith> and died on level 2
<DSNesmith> they'd have gone to limbo
<Axel_Foaley> He should've used a toenail clipper as his totem.
<DSNesmith> if they made 14
<DSNesmith> and died
<DSNesmith> they'd go to limbo at lvl 15
<Dman> and died on lvl 14 yea
<DSNesmith> also this song fucking rocks
<DSNesmith> why are we not watching rarity sing
<Ziltoid> yeah it does
<Dman> Watching Mulan just for this scene. everyone does this.
<Silverscreen> what thread?
<DSNesmith> Mulan was actually a good movie
<Dman> very good
<DSNesmith> one of the last good animated disney ones
<Sathi> the thread on Oat
<Dman> i have VHS and DVD : )
<Silverscreen> What part of Mulan?
<Ziltoid> I never watched it
<ValtheJean> D:
<DSNesmith> and it came after the atrocious pochohauntus and hunchback
<Sathi> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/36267469.html
*Dman bops zitloid on the head
<Silverscreen> What thread on /oat/?
<SirSprinkles> 6I wonder how The Brony Show gets stickied all the time... might be because their thread is only up right before their show starts...
<Axel_Foaley> So, Cobb died again when the 4 layer collaped?
<Dman> nicely
<DSNesmith> Frollo was great, but the rest of HoND was terrible
<Ziltoid> what
<DSNesmith> 4 layer didn't collapse
<Ziltoid> hunchback was good
<Dman> Hunchback was pretty ok, not atrocious
<Silverscreen> but isn't their show weekly?
<DSNesmith> limbo didn't explode, cobb got shot by saito
<Dman> all very interesting
<DSNesmith> who then shot himself
<SirSprinkles> 6It is, Silver.
<Dman> Guys i'm gonna go eat and shower should be back before show!
<DSNesmith> and then limbo ceased to exist per se
<DSNesmith> see limbo is a blank slate
<Sathi> 7Enjoy dman!
<Sathi> 7See you in a bit
<Silverscreen> Isn't that a bit of preferential? I mean, it's no different from our thread....
<Axel_Foaley> I still don't get how he went from the billionaire son's dream to saito's dream.
<DSNesmith> the only reason it had all those buildings and stuff
<Dman> Thank you Sathi see ya in a while
<DSNesmith> was because cobb had been there before
<Dman> everyone
<SirSprinkles> 6Their threads get stickied right before their shows...
<DSNesmith> limbo is the collective unconcious
<DSNesmith> it's kinda Jungian
<DSNesmith> they're all linked through the machine
<DSNesmith> and they share dreamspace
<DSNesmith> limbo doesn't have a dedicated dreamer
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, but it might be because their threads are put up like, a couple hours before thier shows and taken down after their show ends.
<SirSprinkles> 6Whereas ours are up all week.
<DSNesmith> whoever's inside it, is dreaming
<Silverscreen> not the selection thread.
<DSNesmith> is this the micheal bolton version?
<Silverscreen> That goes up for three days at the most.
<DSNesmith> or the good one
<ValtheJean> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, we don't do Selection Threads anymore anyway...
<ValtheJean> there's your answer :P
<Hipster_Brony> i have actually asked on /meta/ that threads like that not get stickied
<DSNesmith> sigh
<DSNesmith> I loved this movie
<DSNesmith> I still do
<DSNesmith> so much parental bonus and greek mythology references
<SirSprinkles> 6Since dari can take the list straight off the chat.
<SirSprinkles> 6And I know you have, Hipster.
<DSNesmith> plus, Hades
<Hipster_Brony> also, for future pre-shows: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1GRj6CNSGg
<Silverscreen> oh, cool.
<ValtheJean> lol
<DSNesmith> is my hair out?
<ValtheJean> yeah, Hades is one of the better Disney villains
<Hipster_Brony> dont play it today though cuz its better with the video
<DSNesmith> the list probably goes
<DSNesmith> Frollo>Hades>Scar>Everyone else
<DSNesmith> has anyone made a Hellfire PMV yet?
<Sol> Frollo is the best Disney villain
<DSNesmith> because that needs to happen
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, yeah.
<SirSprinkles> 6Maybe post-show.
<ReticentSmolder> holla holla get Octavia, sup bronies
<SirSprinkles> 6Frollo is hilarious.
<SirSprinkles> 6Hello Reticent.
<ReticentSmolder> I love 80's power ballads
<DSNesmith> HELLFIIIIIIIIYA BURNING IN MAH SKIIIIIN
<ReticentSmolder> oh teh noes DSNesmith
<DSNesmith> this is from the 90s btw lol
<ReticentSmolder> orly?
<Axel_Foaley> A man as the best Disney villain?
<DSNesmith> yarly
<Hipster_Brony> RBD brought up a good point on skype
<DSNesmith> another villain I liked
<ReticentSmolder> she's...entrancing 0.0
<DSNesmith> was actually from the recent movie
<DSNesmith> Tangled or whatever
<DSNesmith> the mother was interesting
<Hipster_Brony> we're gonna lose a shitload of fans on the FB page cuz of the brony purge
<Silverscreen> SO...christmas in July special, eh?
<ReticentSmolder> I liked the Huns from Mulan, they were dicks
<DSNesmith> because she wasn't some evil witch with super duper magic
<Silverscreen> on the 25th...nice.
<DSNesmith> she was this coldhearted, manipulative bitch
<Silverscreen> Brony purge?
<Silverscreen> Whut?
<DSNesmith> also yes huns rock
<DSNesmith> but they didn't get enough screen time :/
<Silverscreen> oh, I get it.
<Hipster_Brony> my profile got removed by facebook
<Silverscreen> Multiple accounts for bronies.
<ReticentSmolder> Huns are a historical villain, they didn't even need an evil backstory
<SirSprinkles> 6Facebook is killing profiles.
<Hipster_Brony> and so did a ton of other peoples
<Sol> Huns pop ouy of the snow
<Sol> LIKE DAISEYS
<ValtheJean> probably because of the nostalgia effect, I was always fond of Maleficent
<Axel_Foaley> I was surprised at how much I liked Tangled.
<ReticentSmolder> Huns have LEVERAGE
<Silverscreen> Killing pony profiles, right?
<DSNesmith> I really enjoyed Tangled
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, Silver.
<DSNesmith> it was a huge throwback to classic disney
<DSNesmith> which they haven't done in a while
<ValtheJean> yeah, I think Tangled was much better than a lot of people were expecting (myself included)
<DSNesmith> DON'T HURT ME
<DSNesmith> NO MORE
<Axel_Foaley> I prefer Stardust over it though.
<ReticentSmolder> I haven't seen it, can't get me to see it without Netflix or something because I'm too embarrassed to see kids movies in theatres
*DSNesmith headbobs
*ReticentSmolder bobs heads
<DSNesmith> a brony embarassed to see kids' movies?
<ReticentSmolder> lol
<DSNesmith> trololololo
*Sol hoofpumps
<ValtheJean> there are still closet bronies you know :P
<Hipster_Brony> another one for post show sprinkles: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PdOx24p14o

<ReticentSmolder> if it was MLP I would see the movie in an instant, but yeah, going to a kids movie, especially by yourself, is embarrassing
*Light_Latias 12o-o
<Axel_Foaley> I prefer the term Wardrobe Brony
<DSNesmith> I saw Toy Story 3 alone
<Light_Latias> 12suprise day off today
<DSNesmith> because I had the day off and no one else did D:
<anonymouse> MLP the movie really sucked
<ReticentSmolder> <------------- bit of an anonypony
<ValtheJean> well Pixar is different
<DSNesmith> was glad I did though
<Ziltoid> Toy story made me cry manly tears
<DSNesmith> TS3 I was fine
<Mai> >GOing to a kid's movie by yourself is embarassing - This is why I have an 8 year old cousin.
<ValtheJean> since it's already established itself as an "everyone" movie
<DSNesmith> I even made it through the incinerator
<DSNesmith> but that last scene
<DSNesmith> where he plays with bonnie
<DSNesmith> I was bawling
<Sol> I'm in musical theator and wear purple converse. I figured people will think I'm gay/effeminate no matter what I do at this point
<SilverSonic|Live> LL!
<Ziltoid> yeah
<SilverSonic|Live> TUNE IN
<ReticentSmolder> @Mai /duh, why didn't I think of that :P
<SilverSonic|Live> :D http://radionintendo.com/listen.m3u
<Light_Latias> 12ohai SS
<Axel_Foaley> TS3 toyed with my nostalgia too hard.
<Sol> :P
*Light_Latias 12lucky then :3
<DSNesmith> and I was the only college-age kid in there
<ReticentSmolder> I see what you did thar Axel_Foaley
<DSNesmith> it was a bunch of little kids
<DSNesmith> so I got a lot of strange looks from the midgees
<SilverSonic|Live> the actual show hasnt started yet, but im live with some Mega Man tunage
<DSNesmith> but idgaf, I was weeping
<Sol> I cried in Harry Potter, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.
<Axel_Foaley> Good, because I don't.
<Mai> So I found this channel on /oat/...slap me if this is stupid but what is it? xD
<Axel_Foaley> Oooh. "Toy"
<Dashite> Meh. Just walk into the theatre like a baws. Who cares what the people in the theatre think. It's not likely you'll ever see them again. :p
<DSNesmith> sup Mai, it's Brony Movie... afternoon?
<Sol> I cried harder in Bridge to Terabithia
<Ziltoid> mai this is your life
<Mai> Oh cool.
<DSNesmith> we watch movies and talk to each other
<DSNesmith> otensibly
<ReticentSmolder> I once saw Aliens v Predators, but they accidentally switched the reel with Pokemon, so we got the corny kids previews and 5 minutes of intro while the kids in the other theatre were pissing themselves to Aliens
*Light_Latias 12o-o
<Mai> MAH LIFE.
<Dashite> Not always in that order.
<DSNesmith> it's really more 'movies play while bronies snark and force memes'
<Light_Latias> 12suprise day off
<Axel_Foaley> Funny. I've only ever snuck into movie with my family.
<SirSprinkles> 6OH GAWD
<Dashite> Sometimes we talk to each other and oh right there is a movie or something isn't there?
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya LL
<DSNesmith> and write bad clopfic in chat
<HyperMetalLugia> :3)
<Mai> What movie's next, or do you know?
<Sol> Like leverage
<SirSprinkles> 6THAT'S AWESOME
<Light_Latias> 12hiyas :3
<Dashite> Jaws is up next.
*Light_Latias 12stretches
<Ziltoid> jaws
<ReticentSmolder> @DSNesmith its not BAD
<Sol> And HORSES: BRAVER AND FASTER...SIR
<Link> o.o
<Mai> Awesome!
<Axel_Foaley> o.o My family steals together.
<DSNesmith> @reticentsmolder have you read Pizza Party
<Ziltoid> the black dynamite
<DSNesmith> that was very bad
<Light_Latias> 12what?
<Ziltoid> then*
<DSNesmith> intentionally so
<ReticentSmolder> nope.jpg
<Dashite> But you really need to stay for Black Dynamite.
<Light_Latias> 12I SHOULD be upset by it
<Light_Latias> 12but it was a short shift oxo
<Ziltoid> you gig mai?
<Ziltoid> dig*
<ReticentSmolder> Black Dynamite was WAY better than jaws, at least in entertainment
<Winter-Puff> aye
<HaveDynomiteWillTravel> WHOO! GO INKY! GO INKY! IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY! IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY!
<Axel_Foaley> Black Dynamite > Jaws. However Jaws is one movie that NEVER needs to be remade.
<Link> nuthin
<Link> :3
*Link huggles LL :3
<Dashite> Just don't interrupt his kung fu.
<HaveDynomiteWillTravel> Agreed with everyone about BD
<DSNesmith> are we getting RainbowRolled?
<ReticentSmolder> @Axel_Foaley and yet it was...over and over
<HaveDynomiteWillTravel> *everypony
<DSNesmith> Black Dynamite was totally unexpected
<Dermathil> Alright, the one and only Dermathil is back.
<SirSprinkles> 6The B movie is almost always better than the A movie for the week. Almost.
<ReticentSmolder> This is Rainbow Trololol @DSNesmith
<Ziltoid> lottery today right?
<Axel_Foaley> And those remakes/sequels all failed. Except Deep Blue Sea
<Sol> Except for those.... rare occasions
<Dashite> Godfather vs Battlefield Earth.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, Ziltoid.
<ReticentSmolder> errr Rainbow *Tylenol*
*Light_Latias 12huggles back
<DragonRage> Good morning, bronies!
<Dermathil> Sprinkles: yeah. Though If I put Blade Runner as A movie then it's gonna be invalid.
<DragonRage> Or afternoon.
<HaveDynomiteWillTravel> Morning, DragonRage
<ReticentSmolder> sup DragonRage
<Sol> Good Morrow
<DSNesmith> bad books are bad, bad food is bad, bad movies are good
<DSNesmith> okay guys
<Dermathil> afternoon DragonRage
<DSNesmith> we need to get srs here
<DSNesmith> B movie next week has, HAS, HAAAAS to be Wicker Man
<Sol> Eh, depends oh the bad movie.
<Elky> well, 'bad' movies are more like fast food
<ReticentSmolder> hey mods, can I suggest a youtube vid while we wait?
<Dermathil> Nope, DSNesmith. If I choose B movie then we getCUBE.
<Elky> objectively bad, but it's still good
<DSNesmith> okay cube is lulzy
<DSNesmith> but Wicker Man!
<Pinkamina> aeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiou
<Light_Latias> 12~
<Axel_Foaley> I saw Wicker Man in theatres thinking it was a different movie (I had no internet)
<Dermathil> BTW, SirSprinkles, I do remember that a certain B movie was so horrible the one who suggested it was banned from suggestions. I doubt that B movie was better than the A movie of that week.
<Sol> By bad do we mean cheesy or horrible?
<DSNesmith> oh but I could troll if I get picked
<DSNesmith> I know a movie worse than Spider's Web
<Sol> That's why he said almost
<ReticentSmolder> @Dermathil it was Spider's Web
<Dermathil> DSNesmith: Cube isn't "Lulzy". It is mindbending in an awesome way.
<DSNesmith> I know several actually
<Dermathil> No need to NAME it ReticentSmolder.
<DSNesmith> but the worst
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't know what you're talking about Dermathil
<DSNesmith> Night Train to Mundo Fine
<Dashite> You found something worse than Spider's Web?
<HaveDynomiteWillTravel> Smolder: It was Twilight, wasn't it?
<Link> ~~~~
<SirSprinkles> 6We only aired an A movie that week.
<Dermathil> exactly, SirSprinkles.
<Mai> We should watch Godzilla vs Bambi.
<Mai> Yes it exists.
<SilverSonic|Live> ;o
<DSNesmith> ... do it
<SilverSonic|Live> well at least you get to hear my show in full today :3
<Dermathil> The only other week we did that was week 1 and I wasn't there.
<Sol> Rules 1 and 2 of BMN
<ReticentSmolder> ooooh, we TOTALLY need to see a classic Godzilla movie
<DSNesmith> hey sirsprinkles are you streaming?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, DSN.
<ReticentSmolder> yeah
<DSNesmith> see if you can find a clip of godzilla vs bambi
<DragonRage> Oh gods, this song.
<ReticentSmolder> DO THE MARIO!
<DSNesmith> because that sounds amazing
<DSNesmith> OH THIS
<DragonRage> So many memories.
<Dermathil> OH HECK YEAHJ
<DragonRage> RIP Captain Lou.
<DSNesmith> Everybody walk the mario
<ReticentSmolder> I *LOVED* this show as a kid
<ReticentSmolder> Pony Mario?
<Dermathil> I wanna be the fanboy has this when the mario boss dies. Freaking hard to survive.
<Light_Latias> 12yays
<HaveDynomiteWillTravel> DEEK
<DSNesmith> I wanna be
<Light_Latias> 12:3
<DSNesmith> has anyone ever beaten IWBTG
<DSNesmith> in this chat
<Dermathil> Nope
<Light_Latias> 12~~~~~
<Dashite> Sadly no.
<ReticentSmolder> @SirSprinkles have you seen the youtube vid I, Brony?
<Nittany_Tiger> Never played it.
<DSNesmith> I can't get to Mecha Birdo
<Dermathil> YES
<DSNesmith> that freaking zombie level
<DragonRage> I only beat half of it. The Metroid section burned me out.
<HaveDynomiteWillTravel> I don't know what it is /bad with abbreviations
<Dermathil> PONY POLKA
<Light_Latias> 12oh, SS
<DSNesmith> I can't ever get past the zombies
<Light_Latias> 12I finished Master Quest :3
<SilverSonic|Live> yush
<SilverSonic|Live> yay!
<Light_Latias> 12 HJUOLKN>W SJYDKUHNS BJ RHYME
<DSNesmith> the Ghouls and Ghosts area is just awful
<DSNesmith> the spike tunnel
<DSNesmith> uuuugh
<SilverSonic|Live> Lol
<DSNesmith> and the freaking bats
<Dashite> That spike tunnel is where I left off.
<SirSprinkles> 6Reticent, I've streamed it a few times.
<SirSprinkles> 6I love that vid.
<Dermathil> The final parts.
<Mai> This is all I could find on youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBkc2jK-6w
<ReticentSmolder> good shit eh?
<SirSprinkles> 6NO LINKS! /obligatory
<Dermathil> ^^
<DSNesmith> but IWBTG had the best intro ever
<Axel_Foaley> Is Mousehunt an A or B movie?
<DSNesmith> start
*Dermathil nukes the link with his rocket lawnchair.
<DSNesmith> move left
*Light_Latias 12was hoping that would add Ganon(dorf) to the Boss Gauntlet
<DSNesmith> WHAM SPIKE WALL
<ReticentSmolder> Diminutive and youtfhul equines of mine possession, oh yes, indeed, Diminutive and youtfhul equines of mine possession.
<Light_Latias> 12but apparently not :/
<SirSprinkles> 6Mousehunt? Probably A...
<DSNesmith> move down avoid walls
<DSNesmith> suddenly OTHER WALL
<ReticentSmolder> Suddenly, i feel the most appealing urge to give an artistic display regarding the presence of diminutive and youtfhul equines of mine possession, and thus i shall proceed with performing the aforementioned act in a timely and considerable manner, my dearest companions. Diminutive and youtfhul equines of mine possession.
*Light_Latias 12guesses it's because you can re-fight him naturally
<DSNesmith> go up instead of down
<DSNesmith> see apples
<DSNesmith> die to apple
*Nittany_Tiger just officially woke up. :/
<DSNesmith> avoid apple
<DSNesmith> jump over tree
<Dermathil> Blade Runner is my A choice, CUBE is my B choice.
<DSNesmith> apple falls up and kills you
<Dermathil> SIDEWAYS APPLE
<ReticentSmolder> @Nittany_Tiger feelsgoodman.jpg
<DSNesmith> and that was when I realized this was the greatest game ever
<Zecora> they are more like giasnt cherries
<ReticentSmolder> @Dermathil I second Blade Runner
<SirSprinkles> 6I have an amazing B choice... I have a lot of A choices, like Jaws, which we get to watch. : D
<Nittany_Tiger> I wanted to do other things this Saturday.
<Dashite> Death fruit.
<Axel_Foaley> Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night is my B movie.
<DragonRage> Delicious Fruit.
<Sol> BTW, inb4 mods win the lotto this week :P
<Nittany_Tiger> Oversleep is actually a bad habit I have.
<Dermathil> I am a good movie finder.
<Dermathil> I know quality.
<ReticentSmolder> lay it on us SirSprinkles, what movie, TELL ME TELL ME TELL ME
<Ziltoid> Falling down as A and reanimator as B
<Dashite> Finding a good A movie is easy. Finding a good B movie is hard.
<Dermathil> CUBE is a good B movie.
<Sol> Musicals make excellent B movies
<DSNesmith> wonder if galaxy quest is A or B
<DSNesmith> XANADU
<ReticentSmolder> B
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh hell no. Not musicals.
<DragonRage> I second Reanimator, on the grounds that I don't know what it's like but with a name like that...
<DSNesmith> xanadu is beyond a musical
<Elky> other way round. There are tons of excellent a movie choices
<Sol> Oh hell yes, musicals
<Elky> but only few for the b movies
<WhatPayne> O hey what's going on?
<Sol> >:D
<Dermathil> Musicals: the movie version of Phantom of the Opera.
<ReticentSmolder> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOKLAHOMA where the wind comes rolling down the plaaaaaaaaaaaaains
<Axel_Foaley> I might pick Happily Ever After as the B movie since Backslide is the villain that movie and everyone would going "COFOUND THESE..." throughout the movie.
<Veewave> Space Mutiny is good
<Ziltoid> the reanimator is so fucking good
<DSNesmith> space mutiny
<DSNesmith> amazing
<DSNesmith> all the 80s hair
<Sol> Repo the Genetic Opera is pretty B
<ReticentSmolder> Anybrony here seen Across The Universe?
<Sol> I have
<DSNesmith> Gattica was a decent A
<Dermathil> 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY is an A movie. No ifs or BUts.
<DragonRage> Also seconding Repo, I really want to see that here sometime.
<Axel_Foaley> Hot Fuzz is my A
<DSNesmith> oh god
<DSNesmith> 2001 is a snorefest
<Dermathil> HEY
<Elky> Gattaca was okay...
<HaveDynomiteWillTravel> Mine too, Axel. :D
<ValtheJean> I can feel it DSNesmith
<Dermathil> DON'T INSULT KUBRICK'S WORK
<ValtheJean> I can feel it
<Elky> if only for uma thurman
<ValtheJean> DSnesmith I can feel it
<DSNesmith> not saying it wasn't an important film
<ValtheJean> DSNesmit, I can feel it
<DSNesmith> but it wasn't an interesting one
<ReticentSmolder> any movie requiring a time machine to become accurate is weird (ie 2001 since we're already past it)
<Mai> I like how this song isn't so much a parody of Lady Gaga rather than an EXPLANATION of her.
<Axel_Foaley> Vicky Christina Barcelona might be the A if I'm in a bad mood.
<DSNesmith> all the parts with HAL are cool
<DSNesmith> but the 14 minute docking scene bored me to death
<DSNesmith> and the ending is ridiculous
<Dermathil> Reticent: hey, that's like saying Blade Runner is weird too. Seeing how it is supposed to happen in 2019
<Axel_Foaley> Sex and the City: The first movie to be denied by the mods.
<Dermathil> DSNesmith: that's because you haven't seen the sequel.
<Sol> You know what else makes good Bs? 80s and 60s movies
<Sol> Clue would be an excellent B
<Dermathil> Sol: 2001 is a 60s movie.
<DSNesmith> we should watch Star Trek 2
<Sol> See what I mean!
<DSNesmith> KHAAAAAAAAAAAN
<drfsupercenter> 03<Light_Latias> suprise day off today <- :O
<Dman> TADAIMA (okaeri~~)
<Axel_Foaley> Star Trek 2: Wrath of Trixie.
<Sol> Cult classics are also good Bs
<Dermathil> I'm gonna stick to my CUBE and Blade Runner as my movie roster for the movie nights.
<ReticentSmolder> Would Road Warrior be an A movie?
<drfsupercenter> 03and sigh, woke up too late, so I won't have a chance to watch HP7.1 before I see part 2 >_>
<DSNesmith> loool
<Dermathil> Both CUBE and Blade Runner are cult movies.
<Dman> Dermathil - maybe i'll go with Cube if i'm picked : P
<Sol> Really, anything that isn't still relevant/ doesn't have a huge budget
<DSNesmith> The Sound of Thunder movie
<Sol> Pick of Destiny
<Ziltoid> How do guys determand if a movie is A or B
<Dman> Dermathil don't you think cube is way more cult than blade runner thou? I do
<Hipster_Brony> 8>sound of thunder movie

<DSNesmith> that movie is stupid and dumb
<SilverMane> it's alright.
<Dermathil> (if we do both get chosen in luck)
<Dman> ... ok then it's decided Dermathil i'll pick CUBE if i'm picked. I'd like to point out that it isn't my FAVOURITE movie thou, it's just a good idea of a pick
<Light_Latias> 12o.o

<Dman> um
<Elky> I'm still looking for a good b movie to pick...
<ReticentSmolder> @Dermathil, I will put up Blade Runner, not sure about CUBE since I haven't seen it
<DSNesmith> would Men in Black be A or B?
<DSNesmith> it has an A budget for the time
<Axel_Foaley> A
<ReticentSmolder> B
<Elky> a
<SilverMane> if I get picked for B movie, we're watching House (1987), A movie is Toy Story 3
<Dermathil> COOLFACE
<ReticentSmolder> damn
<Elky> toy story 3? hasn't everyone seen that one already?
<Dman> I think Treasure Planet is, because it means a lot to me. it was shown when big stuff happened in my live AND i resonate with the protagonist very well. LOVE the song 'still here' too
<DSNesmith> how about The Bed that Eats
<SirSprinkles> 6Men in Black is definitely A.
<HaveDynomiteWillTravel> SHOO BE DO
<SirSprinkles> 6>has not seen Toy Story 3
<Dman> MiB A movie obviously
<SirSprinkles> 6Spoil it and I kill you.
<Dman> SIRSPRINKILES!
<ReticentSmolder> so A is high production value, B is low/ cult classic?
<Dman> Prepare your tears
<DSNesmith> spoiler alert: the toys are made of plastic
<Ziltoid> ANDY WIN
<Sol> Scott Pilgrim and Reefer Madness the Musical. GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Elky> me neither, but everyone who wanted should've seen it...
<DSNesmith> oh wow
<DSNesmith> is this Disturbed polka
<SirSprinkles> 6I will seriously ban you if you spoil that movie.
<HaveDynomiteWillTravel> Good point Dman. A movie or show can be horrible but mean a lot to you on a personal level
<Elky> yep reticent
<SilverMane> SOL wins CAKE!
<ReticentSmolder> @SirSprinkles challenge accepted
<DSNesmith> reefer madness... the musical?
<Dermathil> True, Dman, Treasure Planet was good movie. Maybe the biggest Disney flop on a financial point, but a good movie still (SCI-FI again)
<Sol> Yes
<SilverMane> look at that Inky Pie, she dancing awesome
<SilverMane> Reefer Madness is fucking hilarious!
<DSNesmith> poor treasure planet
<DSNesmith> the movie that killed 2d animation
<ReticentSmolder> hey Ghosties, how would you like to be shipped today?
<HaveDynomiteWillTravel> You shoulda seen her earlier, Silvemane. She was dancing WITH NO MUSIC
<Dermathil> Also, I learnt to enjoy Treasure Planet even more after reading Treasure Island.
<Dman> Sorry guys just a sec mmy dad's on the phone
<Sol> It's actually a parody of the original propoganda film
<Sathi> hey Ghosties
*Dman tempporarily leaves
<HaveDynomiteWillTravel> I enjoy Treasure Planet less after seeing DisneyFan01's art
<Hipster_Brony> o hai ghosties
<Axel_Foaley> I hated Treasure Planet. Atlantis demolished it as an adventure movie.
<DSNesmith> I loved the original treasure island
<HaveDynomiteWillTravel> But I do still enjoy it
<DSNesmith> atlantis!
<DSNesmith> great movie
<DSNesmith> I loved that one
<SilverMane> Reefer Madness is hilarious, watched it 3 or 4 times last Fall
<Ghosties> 4@ReticentSmolder: I'd like to be shipped without too many handling fees
<Dman> axel_foaley hates my favourite movie
<Ghosties> Hey guys
<Dermathil> Axel Foaley: you do know it is a sci-fi view of the treasure planet, right?
<Elky> would from dusk til dawn be a b movie?
<Elky> ohai ghosties
<Dermathil> 3 minutes
<DSNesmith> ooh we could watch 40 days of night
<DSNesmith> or Aliens
<SilverMane> @Ghosties: I'm the mandatory shipping char, so you would co-star with me
<Dermathil> actually, 1 minute 'til movies
<DSNesmith> or John Carpenter's The Thing
<DSNesmith> although people mgiht not be able to handle the Thing
<Axel_Foaley> There was a horrible mechanical Jar Jar in Treasure Island?
<DSNesmith> it's pretty gruesome
<DSNesmith> YES
<DSNesmith> RARITY
<Dman> sorry guys im on da phone
<DSNesmith> all my <3s are belong to you
<Sathi> 7tyt
<Dman> =]
<DSNesmith> dunno how but rarity made this song awesome, which I thought was impossible
*ReticentSmolder @ghosties : Ghosties was stuck in a tight compartment, waking with the taste of chloroform on his tongue. His hooves pushed against the confines of his container and the sides fell apart easily. Apparently whomever shipped him didn't splurge on handling fees.
<Dman> 0_o
<Axel_Foaley> In Atlantis, the treasure hunter KEPT the gold for once.
<ValtheJean> duh, it's cause ponies make everything better
<Nittany_Tiger> Is that guy that wanted my Saw stuff here?
<Dermathil> SHOW TIME
<Dermathil> IT SAYS SO ON THE PAGE
<DSNesmith> okay chloroform should never be int he opening line of a shipfic 0.o
<Ghosties> 4Why don't you two ship Hipster_Brony or SirSprinkles next?
<Light_Latias> 12D:
<Sol> Wow, I just realized. No one suggested horror titles yet
<Elky> still 10 secs for me
<Light_Latias> 12bai SS D:
<Sol> BUT I WILL
<Axel_Foaley> Giving up the gold is the worst trope of all time.
<Light_Latias> 12*bad
<Dman> 4 secs
<DSNesmith> Alien!
<Elky> 3
<WhatPayne> This song reminds of Rarity....

<Destructor236> dat 8bit.
<Dave_BroZilla> CAUSE TOMORROW SPRING IS HERE
*DSNesmith Silvermane stepped nervously backwards, quickly deciding to get out of the crazy house before he accidentally burned it down or something equally bad.

*DSNesmith He looked back in alarm as the machine rumbled. There was an earsplitting whine, and his vision began to distort. The room looked as if it were swallowing itself.
<Axel_Foaley> Chad Rocco is right. MLP is really good in 8bit.
<Dman> Elky ninja'd u to it! : D

<DragonRage> Suddenly, communication!
*DSNesmith Without warning, Silvermane found himself in the middle of the sky. He was standing on top of a cloud, utterly confused.
<Gnorri> derp derp derp derp derp derp derp derp
<Darf14> I hear the music, oh crud shes screwed
<Dman> A MA GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD

<Ghosties> 4It's great that the drunk guy isn't the one that actually dies.
*RainBroDash 10shakes head. Canon silvermane is pegasus :3
<Darf14> The shark is sure taking his time
<Tyranico> I bet that shark is feeling really good about itself right about now
*DSNesmith He gave a startled yell as he plummeted through the cloud, hurtling toward the ground.
<Wrek> this makes me think of egoraptors shark parody...
*Dman is an earth pony
<Darf14> and yet the drunk guy lives
<Dermathil> RED SEA
<Axel_Foaley> Sharks don't like larynxs apparently
<Gnorri> that blood
<Elky> instantly killing them is too mainstream
<Sol> Aw, she's playing Hide and Seek, how cute~ /)^3^(\
<Srake> Sun...Shine/
*DSNesmith The ground rushed up to meet him. He closed his eyes and winced, bracing for the end-
<Dave_BroZilla> Jaws vs. Jurassic Park >>>> Freddy vs. Jason
<Axel_Foaley> sigh, the black guy always dies first.
<Dman> CIAMOUN Rainbrodash
<GabeMoist> What if sharks could walk on land?
<Elky> so he picks of the pieces one by one
<ReticentSmolder> @DSNesmith but SilverMane IS a pegasus, how would time travel take his wings?
<Dermathil> Elky: they don't kill instantly. They usually nom a leg off.
<DSNesmith> no he's not, he's a unicorn
<GabeMoist> or fly?
<Dashite> I thought Silverman was a unicorn...
<DragonRage> If sharks could walk on land, we'd be screwed.
<Destructor236backup> sorry guys.i clicked on the rules and i logged out.

<drfsupercenter> 03<usotsuki> [14:15] <@Io> Troubled singer Amy Winehouse, known for her smoky soul voice and her struggle with drink and drugs, has been found dead at her flat in north London, police said. She was 27 years old.
<drfsupercenter> 03<usotsuki> [14:15] <@Io> The Grammy award-winning soul singer with her trademark beehive battled with well-documented addictions that she documented in her hit single "Rehab". Her death is being treated as unexplained, Scotland Yard said.

*ReticentSmolder Upon hearing this Silvermane gasped. He just celebrated the Summer Sun Festival two months ago, but that was the *1002nd* celebration. Realization dawned on him that he was still in Ponyville, but eleven years into the future!
<Dman> the one Silvermane sent ya

<Nittany_Tiger> Has anyone here actually eaten grass?
<DSNesmith> these two are so obviously in love
<DragonRage> Hellfish.
<Dman> lol darf14
<DragonRage> How many levels of Rogue did Jaws take, anyways?
<Bjornfot> I have, Nittany_Tiger.
*ReticentSmolder "Uuuuum, yeah, Scootaloo, you mind if we grab a bite to eat? My treat. I just want to thank you for saving me and all." Secretly he wanted to add 'and to ask where the last 11 years went'.
<Srake> Lan sharks
<Nittany_Tiger> Same.
<DSNesmith> no I'm not! yes you are! no I'm not! yes you are! I can't! yes you can!

<Dman> Oh Silvermane, DSNesmith, i thought you were on about new ones. I have that .pdf since like 3 weeks ago : P
<Gnorri> that pretzel!
<Dman> Gief pretzel
<Darf14> note to self, don't piss off a peaceful town or else a lot of people will want your head
<Dermathil> BUMP
<Dave_BroZilla> GRammar. wanna = want to
<Dman> Drinking game?
<Dman> GLUG
<Dave_BroZilla> Want a pretzel?
<prince-dari> How do you want me to send you the txt file Hip?
*ReticentSmolder "Sure," Scootaloo chirped, her brilliant blue wonderbolt's flightsuit shone in the mid-afternoon sun as she looked in the direction of Sweetie Bell. "Only if my friends can join too, I think we could all use a break."
<Dave_BroZilla> Want to pretzel?
<DSNesmith> this fic has a 'Whoa' tag
<DSNesmith> can I read this without damning myself
<Dman> How do I ate pretezel?
<Hipster_Brony> send it to sprinkles
<SilverMane> Dman, read 'Kindness's Reward' if you want an amazing story of a ship, although it is not a clop-fic
<Hipster_Brony> well
<Dman> DSNesmith i've read all dem : P
<Dman> Silvermane : )
<DragonRage> I'd like to pretzel.
<prince-dari> Also, I'm going to leave ChanServ in, because it would be so funny is he won one time.
<Hipster_Brony> just save it as a draft in the BronyState email account
<RainbowLoon> hay everypony
<SilverMane> DSNesmith, it's 2nd person starring Rainbow Dash
<Dman> did you SAY he wanted a pretzel? no...well yes
<RainBroDash> 10"although it is not a clop-fic" has become a clause in this conversation. I never thought I'd see the day
<Bjornfot> You have mighty fine taste in fics, SilverMane.
<prince-dari> MFW I don't know the email account.
<Light_Latias> 12kay
<Dman> lol RainBroDash, too true mate

<Hipster_Brony> oh, and can you take out duplicates that are using the same hostname?
<Elky> and I'm outta here
<Dman> lol elky
<DSNesmith> oh god it's a trixie fic
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Hipster_Brony> for the email
*ReticentSmolder After carefully dusting off and replacing the fallen items on Appleblooms fashion cart, the two had beckoned for Sweetie Bell to join them, who had recently finished her session with the orchestra and was approaching them with a smile.
<Hipster_Brony> its BronyState@gmail.com
<Hipster_Brony> password is BRONYMOVIENIGHT
<RainBroDash> 10@elky ">2nd person" was particularly entertaining
<RainbowLoon> you running live clopfics *again*?
<Elky> no but really, there's a reason second person is very, very rarely used in fiction
<Razyn> DSNeSmith, What's a Trixie fic? Tell meeeee.
<Hipster_Brony> all caps
<prince-dari> There aren't any ATM, when should I get the list?
<DSNesmith> the fic silvermane mentioned
<SilverSonic|Live> LL, you enjoying the show?

<Dman> : D
<Razyn> Oh. Right the Fluttixie fic,.
<GabeMoist> 2 minutes flat
<Darf14> even when I am getting killed do nothing
<DSNesmith> 2nd person in fiction can be very interesting if done well
<Hipster_Brony> yeah, like 10 minutes before intermission or so
<RainBroDash> during teh ponies?
<Dman> i will ask for a copy afterwards RainBroDash
<DSNesmith> anyone ever read the, uh
<Dermathil> GET BACK ON DA BOAT
<DSNesmith> what were they called
<prince-dari> Will do.
<Dman> uh
<Dman> uh
<DSNesmith> the magic of Recluse novels?
<Elky> tbh, I've never read a good example
<Dave_BroZilla> OH SHI
<Dman> ... no
<Dman> DUUUUUUUUUUN DUN
<Dermathil> I got... surprised by that.
<ReticentSmolder> "Sweetie, this is...ummm, who *are* you anyway?" SilverMane had to think fast. If this *WAS* 11 years from now he would have been labelled as kidnapped, or worse, for being missing so long. Without thinking he turned his head and looked at his uniform.
<DSNesmith> hunger games was 2nd person
<Dave_BroZilla> He pissed the ocean
<RainBroDash> 10dman it'll be on pastebin, providing photofinishhim and dsnesmith don't mind
<DSNesmith> that was good
<SilverMane> Trixshy is my new favorite shipping, due to Kindness's Reward
<Dermathil> Thought it was a barracuda.

<Dman> Razyin i don't always read 2nd person fics but when i do they involve WHOA
<ReticentSmolder> yeah yeah, I know, forgive me, its 108 degrees in Texas right now @RainBroDash
<Chocolate-MintSwirl> 13Dat orchestra
<Elky> I read a bit of the first book and I don't remember it being 2nd person
<Elky> but okay...

<muffin_hooves> His name is Fred.

<Darf14> NO tooth no proof

<DashAttack> Buster Browns
<Razyn> Dermathil It did? Today?
<DSNesmith> oh I'm sorry elky
<Dman> >drama
<Chocolate-MintSwirl> 0Pics or it didn't happen
<DSNesmith> I'm mixing up 2nd person and present tense
<DSNesmith> you're right, 2nd person blows
*ReticentSmolder Silvermane could only look back at Scootaloo with a pained expression, 'think man, what kind of pony delivers pizzas?' "Oh, I'm Pizza Pony." He had meant to add a 'the' but it was lost in his nervous break down, and the damage had been done.
<DSNesmith> present tense can be interesting though
<Dave_BroZilla> BOW CHICKA WOW WOW
<Elky> present tense is okay...
<Ghosties> 4Laugh
<DashAttack> 2nd person is hard to write good in
<Ghosties> 4and grow FAT
<DashAttack> i try to avoid it
<SilverMane> lawl
<DSNesmith> trololololo pizzapony returns
<RainBroDash> 10>the damage had been done.
<DSNesmith> oh here coems jeff goldblum moment
<RainBroDash> 10epic line
<Darf14> Screw the safety of others, lets party!
<SilverMane> And now SilverMane = Pizza Pony is canon
<Axel_Foaley> 2nd person is epic thanks to the Old Spice Guy.
<DSNesmith> oh, uh, uh, this creature, is, uh, a machine
<Sol> You try to avoid second person, because you find it to be hard.
<Razyn> Maybe Pizza Pony can be luckier this time?
<Srake> make little sharks
<Gnorri> i'm right! not crazy! MUAHAHHAHAHAHAH
<DSNesmith> it, erm, uh, all it, eh, does, is, eat and make LITTLE SHARKS, um yeah.
<Darf14> *looks at sign* wow, that sign sucks
<GabeMoist> the national geographic
<SilverMane> Razyn, remember, it was a story within the story
<Dermathil> Corrupt administrative people, don't know shit about safety procedures.
*ReticentSmolder Scootaloo and the others stared at him hard, making him feel uncomfortable, but they quickly broke out into smiles and laughed. SilverMane would have laughed nervously too, if it wasn't at his expense.
<Gnorri> and make little piece of shit
<Dave_BroZilla> and, uh, I'm just saying that, uh, life will, uh, find a way
<Sol> Second person is easy enough for a short story, but for an entire novel it'd be hella hard
<Ghosties> 4Why is that a good majority of creepy pasta is in second person?
<Elky> second person also has very little payoff compared to the difficulty of writing it
<DSNesmith> horror works better if you put the reader into the story, elky
<RainBroDash> 10@ghosties it can make it that bit creepier
<DSNesmith> not so much for other genres
<Elky> hm, maybe
<Razyn> Silvermane we need to go deeper.
<DashAttack> Sol: i should reiterate. i don't feel entirely comfortable writing in 2nd person
<RainbowLoon> O_o my face when thinking of noodles at the mentioning of pasta
<Dman> Reticentsmolder lives in TEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-EEEEEEEEEEEEXAS http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pZxKTGG4N_8/TiVINRtX8-I/AAAAAAAAIy0/oKSedDnEnW4/s1600/Capture.PNG
<DashAttack> it's not familiar territory for me
<SilverMane> Hey SilverMane fans! Guess who is here!
<Axel_Foaley> Choose-Your-Own-Adventure tend to be creepypasta hence the second tense.
<Ghosties> 4...sure, I guess. I think 1st person would be better, but that's me
<PizzaPony> ME!
<Elky> actually, the only published second person I've read are those goosebumps CYOA books
<Dave_BroZilla> MINDBLOWING GRAPHICS
<Dman> 2nd person makes for creepier as u feel there
<Elky> and they were... not good
<DSNesmith> the BEST creepypasta is all 1st person
<Razyn> omygoodness, the scary Pizzapony is here
*ReticentSmolder "So where should we go to eat? I don't know about you but I'm starved!" Sweetie Bell rang. "Me too," Applebloom replied, "how about we go to sweet apple acres and have some of my Sis's fritters?"
<DSNesmith> video game hacks
<Gnorri> killer shark, best videogame ever
<muffin_hooves> I miss arcades.
<GabeMoist> pew pew pew
<Dman> GOTY ERRY YEAR
<DSNesmith> killer shark
<Darf14> Worse arcade game ever
<Sol> Second person forces you to do stuff, it is essentially an order YOU are obligated to fill. In creepypasta, it's "creepyest" (ie not creepy at all) when you are forced to do something rather than have your own say as would be per first person or third person
<Bjornfot> 1. GO TO BEACH
<SilverSonic|Live> ;3
<Bjornfot> 2. PLAY VIDEO GAMES
<ReticentSmolder> @Dman...I only WISH it wasn't true that I owned cowboy boots and a ten gallon hat, even if for a joke once.
<Dave_BroZilla> I once had this arcade that had the Jurassic Park game

<GabeMoist> 8. Make baby sharks
<DSNesmith> anyone know how long this whole stream is going to be?
<DSNesmith> I wanna know how long I can push it
<DragonRage> The big reason CYOAs end up being so bad is because the plot is a jumbled mess and whether the story continues or not can seem entirely random.
<Darf14> 9. Ditch cupcakes and make muffins
<Elky> yep
<DashAttack> Sol: i definitely agree, but i just don't think i've been good enough to convey it in the way i like with my writing style

<NightSeas> !cmda
<NightSeas> !cmds
<DSNesmith> I think I'm gonna miss Black Dynamite *cries*
<Elky> maybe CYOAs just aren't meant to be a serious genre
<DashAttack> not to say i don't hate reading in 2nd person
<SilverMane> RainBroDash, my brother was practically a gangsta, and he rubbed a bit off on me.

<DSNesmith> I loved CYOA
<RainbowLoon> Bjornfot do you wear a horned helmet at least?
<DSNesmith> but I never survived

<NightSeas> 12ºOº
<prince-dari> Hm.
<DashAttack> speaking of CYOA, has anyone ever read the Super Mario Bros. CYOA?
<Dermathil> I think I got a lightning-fast thunderstorm incoming soon.
<SilverMane> ReticentSmolder, less talky, more shippy! (and I'm going back to reading Me and Rainbow Dash shipping. silly 2nd person, making Silver mane get sexed for once)
<RainBroDash> 10SilverMane brilliant; nerdy gangsta
<Gnorri> i love when the kid got killed
*ReticentSmolder The four of them made their way from the town square while talking idly. Sweetie was mentioning her progress in popularity with other singers across Equestria. Scootaloo listened, but couldn't surpress a gag or two at the thought of the romantic lovey-dovey politics between the mares and stallions in the spotlight.

<Axel_Foaley> Predator? Get to da choppah
<DSNesmith> did somepony say FRIENSHIP?
<Armads> I approve of the use of madoka majika
<DragonRage> Think they were D&D based. A lot of the monsters that showed up in them were from D&D.
<AppleCrash> because sharks can hear whistles

<AppleCrash> 1/2 of the people were trampled to death
<DSNesmith> hey sivermane, this RD fic
<DragonRage> Actually trying to fight the black pudding in this one CYOA resulted in your character turning into an idiot with no peripheral vision.
<DSNesmith> this fic contains the line' twitching, erect wings'
<DSNesmith> I... don't want to live ont his planet anymore
<Elky> heh
<Darf14> Everyone Panic, its the best thing to do!
<RainbowLoon> oh hello there, Mr. Mayor. smile, you're on TV
<DragonRage> ... in fact, fighting damn near anything in that CYOA was a dumb idea. Usually it would kill you in one page.
<Dermathil> FKING TROLLS
<DashAttack> i thought about writing a zombie apocalypse CYOA
<Dashite> DSNesmith you know you like it.
<GabeMoist> trolololol

*ReticentSmolder Scootaloo flipped the cowl that had been resting on her back over her head, her mane slipping in to a slot on top while she fastened a pair of yellow goggles to her face.

<SilverMane> LAWL WAT
<Dave_BroZilla> damn, missed that reaction too
*ReticentSmolder For a moment the room was silent except for what SilverMane expected was his heart audibly beating against his ribcage.
<JohnMadden> Just punch him in the face
<Darf14> Jaws: Can I drive?
<Hipster_Brony> the DS2 button would be perfect, but dont use it
<Dermathil> this was a bad idea
<Combustiblelemons> Bad idea is bad.
<SilverMane> inb4 Silvermane X Ribcage
<AppleCrash> just dump millions of barrels of oil into the water.. problem solved
<DashAttack> let's play tug of war!

<Combustiblelemons> *BARREL*
<DSNesmith> "Hammertime."
<muffin_hooves> That trick never works.

<DragonRage> Throw a banana peel at him!
<Dermathil> AW CRAP
*ReticentSmolder SilverMane let out a sigh of relief just as the others looked at her and took the same breath in as a shocked gasp. They hadn't believed a word and here was their friend, not only believing it but going with the ruse.

<Dashite> Dman: Challenge Accepted.
*ReticentSmolder SilverMane, not wanting to let the tension increase any more spoke up, "Well, from what you've told me this is eleven years from what I remember last. After entering Twilight's machine I ended up on a cloud, falling and terrified. Not quite my best moment, thanks again Scootaloo you were awesome."
<DSNesmith> it's time to do what has to be done by me and live up to my family name and face FULL LIFE CONSEQUENCES.

<PoniesPoniesPonies> "The pony pony ponied over the pony at pony."
<SilverMane> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

<SilverMane> RainBroDash2 wtf failsauce
<Combustiblelemons> Disregard other people, fuck up the boat.
*Razyn Every second that passed, his heart quickened just so much. It wasn't long before his creation was flattened against the counter. It was ready. Time to get... Experimental.

*Razyn Holding the secret compartment open, PizzaPony grabbed the small jar of RainBro sprinkles. He released his grip on the miniature drawer, letting it snap shut. He held the jar up high, letting it shine in the pale light of Luna's moon. His favorite topping, reserved only for him. not event the boss knew about it.
<DashAttack> Combustiblelemons: dat herdmind

<DragonRage> What a thrill...
<ReticentSmolder> @RainBroDash also, SilverMane is a pegasus in OC canon, but DSNesmith retcon'd it to be like PizzaPony, so I'm going to roll with him being a unicorn and maybe mentioning that he had been a pegasus before the accident
<Combustiblelemons> Huh? what was that noise!
<Ghosties> It can be troublesome. I was living on my own for a while, but then real life nipped me in the butt

<Elky> well, she does talk about renovating the barn...
<Dman> dat okie dokie lokie

<mib_hjus4d> Yeah Applejack we all know you like Goat porn
<Darf14> *GASP*
<Ghosties> 4Thanks for the love, Dashite, but I must decline the offer >_>

<interior_gummy> Big Pie is watching you
<Dashite> But... but you said... :(
*ReticentSmolder Applebloom, while obviously confused at the entire idea of time travel, saw that SilverMane was telling the truth. "Okay, I kinda get it an I kinda don't. You must be pretty shook up if you've been time traveling in the whoositwhatsits, so what are you gonna do now?"
<Elky> but you could see party preparations are renovations...
<DragonRage> What is a pony? A miserable pile of secrets and lies!
<DesSur> Gummy stares deeply into the voids of SPAAAAACCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

<Ghosties> 4Well, I would HOPE I know what my own name is
<Combustiblelemons> Disturbing.
*ReticentSmolder SilverMane thought for a bit about this. His house was probably sold...or foreclosed for that matter. "I have no place to go, most of my friends and family lived out of town and haven't seen me in years, I doubt they would even recognize me now if they thought I was still alive."
<AppleCrash> SPIKE

<Hipster_Brony> 8>never speak to them again
<Rezo-chan> Madame LeFlour needs to be a recurring character
<Gnorri> derpy pinkie
<Dee_Twenty> Elky: Yes, but Cupcakes was written before the episode was public, so neither one inspired the other.
<Dman> SirSprinkles cheer up!
<Dman> : D
<Elky> true
<DragonRage> Awkward.
<Bane> Yo whaddup
<Dumori> Combustiblelemons try acting out a bigger party solo you get tired way to quick

<Axel_Foaley> I thought the L word was Lesbian, not Losers.
*Razyn After just a short wait, the humble PizzaPony was enjoying his pizza. His lips were coated with warm melty RainBro goo mixed with special sauce. The night drifted away as he lost himself in his own custom pizza. No weirdos, no peanut butter, no... hole punching pizzas. Just him, and his soft dough.
<muffin_hooves> Welcome to the Twilight Zone, Rainbow.
<Nittany_Tiger> RD came to bring Pinkie Pie her pills.
<Elky> Cupcakes Pinkie is rather different from PoO Pinkie anyway
<Darf14> Poor Rainbow

<GabeMoist> SHE KILLED ROCKY
<RobotPinkie> I wonder if Rocky will return for a rematch with Dash.
<mib_hjus4d> Facesit
<Light_Latias> 12this remix makes me think of a whack-a-mole o-o
<Gnorri> i think cupcakes is inspired to the episode whit gilda
<Sol> I'm in lesbians with you
<Dee_Twenty> Dash is so omnisexual even a bucket of turnips gives her a wingboner.
<Hipster_Brony> ponyshrug.jpg
<Combustiblelemons> no wingboner there though

<Dman> Razyn ty bro
<Pinkamina> CHUMP
<interior_gummy> dash has had a wingboner for longer than 4 hours
*ReticentSmolder Another silence fell across the room as the reality of the situation bore down on them. SilverMane was a wayward pony now, had nopony to turn to for help, and he didn't even ask for theirs, only that they point him in the right direction. Sweetie Bell, now overcome with her emotions all but burst, "I'm sure we can find somewhere for you to stay."
<Darf14> Dam farewell parties, they always suck
<Dman> epic music here
<DragonRage> Falcon Kick!
<DesSur> They just can't handle the emotional trauma.
<Dashite> Hat party? I didn't know they had TF2 in equestria!
<Razyn> Thanks, RBD, Dman. Yeah I'd love that link.
<Elky> Rainbow Dash needs pills to get wingboners
<GabeMoist> A FAREWELL TO PINKIE PIE PARTY
<DragonRage> Gravity? What's that?
<prince-dari> Dat physics
<mib_hjus4d> My farewell party wasn't so decorated. :(
