<NewDCD> 9sup Jon
<Sumica> Sup jon
<Dermathil> Hello Jon.
<RobotPinkie> ohai Jon
<Jon> ...Isn't there EVA Pony art?
<Sumica> Dash has too much emotion to play setsuna.
<Winter-puff> hoy hoy jon
<NewDCD> 9yeah, but only one pic that I can recall
<Jon> God why am I capping random letters...Sorry I'll stop.
<NewDCD> 9obviously Setsuna is Scootaloo
<NewDCD> 9Just look at them.
<Jon> I recall a dude on DA doing some..
<NewDCD> 9they're fucking identical aside from hair and eye color
<Sumica> the hair works
*Quanyails 7is still stumped as for a name for her image.
<Jon> Give me a second.
<NewDCD> 9Oh God
<NewDCD> 9....this is glorious http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/0c570ed967488396d9801da2e10217ec/18453%20-%20Sweetie_Belle%20apple_bloom%20comic%20mecha%20robot%20scootabeam%20scootaloo%20super_robot_wars.png

<Jon> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/174/d/0/dj_dro1d_pon3_by_dreatos-d3jqc04.png
<NewDCD> 9that's pretty cool
<NewDCD> 9also
<NewDCD> 9I just realized
<NewDCD> 9Alto = Perfect Caramel
<Sumica> If any thing I see dash being um, what the hell was the one from gunbuster.
<Roara|Touhou> 6uhgudxdkjgvndf
<Dermathil> >mfw I have TWELVE tabs open.
<NewDCD> 9Noriko
<Sumica> that's the one
<Aurora> 6I forgot the continues are different in SA
*Quanyails 7is thinking about just calling it 'Birds'. O_o
<Aurora> 6just fok and see what comes up
<FreezeFrame> I have far more than that.
<Quanyails> 7o.o?
<Aurora> 6fok = face on keyboard
<Aurora> 6like so
<Jon> I normally have 4-5 tabs open.
<Sumica> buster kick so fits with a rainboom.
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Quanyails> 7Interesting abbreviation.
<Quanyails> 7D:
<NewDCD> 9quite frankly
<NewDCD> 9if I were to put Dash in a mech
<NewDCD> 9it'd have to be something much faster than that
<NewDCD> 9probably Cybuster
<Dermathil> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CW6zX7kzO0w/TkRqho2mDMI/AAAAAAAAKQg/awuWXvLZzSw/s1600/rainbow_dash_nanosuit_by_hereticofdune-d4650x9.jpg
<Aurora> WHAT BUTTON DID I PRESS LOL
<Quanyails> 7Weeeeeell, you disconnected.
<Sumica> what mechs that can move in FTL are not fast enough =p
<Espeon|Away> For once i use this name while I'm still actually connected, but I'll be back in not so long :p
<NewDCD> 9Twilight Sparkle is perfect for Nu Gundam though
*Quanyails 7pseudorandomly types and see what she can interpret out of her doodle.
<Jon> >mfw I have no clue whats going on cause I don't watch anything mecha
<NewDCD> 9hence why I said Cybuster
<Quanyails> 7askjaertnadknopdfnjslembirtbsklfg;s;sejirneksldsgldjspaikflfjfdogja;dkghbvghrioperjkga;dkltmeejosghg
<NewDCD> 9Cybuster, the Elemental Lord of the Wind
<Dermathil> Jon, all you have to do is watch.
<NewDCD> 9is probably the fastest mech in fictional history
<Dermathil> And enjoy the sight.
<Aurora> meejos

<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Sweetie Belle - Oh my, sounds serious" -
<NewDCD> 9but other than that
<NewDCD> 9Dash'd be a good Valkyrie pilot
<Nickario> the one marked self destruct?
*Nickario runs
<Sumica> indeed
<Dermathil> So, any idea what pony Simon would be?
<Dermathil> Skip of 3 seconds long
<Dermathil> skip of 7 seconds
<Dermathil> skip of 1 seconds
<NewDCD> 9huh
<NewDCD> 9seems
<Sumica> he's saying the streem is lagging again
<Dermathil> yeah it just began skipping like crazy
<Quanyails> 7Birds is still my best option. X.x
<NewDCD> 9downloading OOO's is taking a lot of my bandwidth
<NewDCD> 9give me a moment to cancel that download
<NewDCD> 9and get one via mediafire
*Quanyails 7says what the heck and continues the dA submission.
<Dermathil> ah, much more fluid now
<Aurora> you gonna try it too, angel?
<Sumica> who needs to aim when you have raie of fire.
<NewDCD> 9welp
<Sumica> er rate

<Dermathil> OOO?
<NewDCD> 9give me a moment
<Dermathil> what's OOO?
<NewDCD> 9gonna bump up the quality
<FreezeFrame> "It was part of a yacht club."
<NewDCD> 9and start the LQ Stream as well
<Dermathil> What's OOO DCD?
<Dermathil> Big O?
<NewDCD> 9Kamen Rider OOO
<Dermathil> OH
<NewDCD> 9what we used to watch in Post-Show
<Sumica> suddenly geting a mental image from the sleep over ep.
<Jon> ...umm...Is there any way to make it so i can keep an eye on both stream and chat without messing with zoom?
<Jon> Cause zoom makes the text tiny.
<Sumica> dont fullscreen the streem
<Thetrollside> is this really whats going on 3 hours before anything starts? >_>
<Dermathil> yes, TTS
<Dermathil> this is what happens before anything start.
<Purple`Prose> Isn't this DCD's last stream?
<Dermathil> This is what happens when we're not Friday or Saturday watching movies
<NewDCD> 9LQ Broadcast is live!
<NewDCD> 9Thetrollside: till the preshow officially starts
<Thetrollside> DCD
<NewDCD> 9which will be later
<NewDCD> 9basically
<Thetrollside> for your last broadcast
<NewDCD> 9it's not even preshow time yet
<Thetrollside> do what i suggested
<RobotPinkie> So if I fall asleep to BMN, will I wake up to dramatic readings of clopfics?
<Thetrollside> if oyu dont remember
<Thetrollside> cupcakes :S
<Jon> ...This looks like fire emblem with mechas.
<NewDCD> 9but I am Le Tired
<Jon> I'm okay with this.
<NewDCD> 9man I like FE a lot
<NewDCD> 9I WISH animations in FE were THIS crazy
<Thetrollside> sleep is for the weak
<Jon> Best game?
<Jon> Oh god if FE had these animations
<NewDCD> 9suddenly Laguz doing crazy million-hit combos on enemies
<RobotPinkie> But when I sleep, I dream of ponies...
<Jon> *Squee*
<NewDCD> 9and Sain multi-stabbing with his lance
<Dermathil> Do Cyberponies dream of electronic sheeps?
<Jon> Lyn I think her name was?
<NewDCD> 9and then Aether looks like a fucking DBZ attack
<Jon> doesn't she just crit everything?
<Dermathil> SO, is the lottery today or tomorrow?
<NewDCD> 9man I love this dynamic kill
<NewDCD> 9I think it's today
<RobotPinkie> Lottery is today
<NewDCD> 9SOKOOOOO
<Jon> Oh god lyn is broken as fuck...*remembers 100% crit rate*
<Jon> I sense badass.
<Sumica> no kill like overkill
<Dumori> oh my bad japanese
<Dermathil> Jon, there are things even more awesome than what's already on stream ATM.
<Thetrollside> if only i understood japanese :S
<Dermathil> Wait 'til you see Gurren Lagann or Dai-Guard in action.
<Dermathil> Those two are insane.
<NewDCD> 9I don't but I STILL ENJOY THE SHIT OUT OF THIS GAME
<Purple`Prose> Is this one of the original units?
<NewDCD> 9e'yup
<Thetrollside> soooo
<Dermathil> Purple, that's the player character.
<Thetrollside> you dont know the story
<Thetrollside> just like the explosions
<Sumica> this guy needs sniper training.
<Dumori> mecha man
<NewDCD> 9well there are translation guides for the story in development
<RobotPinkie> If you think Dai-Guard is awesome, just wait until you see ponies, it'll blow your fuckin' mind
<NewDCD> 9but yeah, I'm clueless
<NewDCD> 9but then again
<Jon> Why not aim for the head? where the pilot is?
<NewDCD> 9Pinkie
<Dermathil> Jon, pilot is way too small?
<NewDCD> 9why do you settle for less?
<Jon> ...Not if you just blow off the head.
<Sumica> besides the pilots are always in the chest.
<NewDCD> 9why not
<Jon> ...Ok i'll buy it sumica.
<NewDCD> 9PONIES IN DAI-GUARD?!
<Thetrollside> oh god
<Thetrollside> on the GROUND?!
<RobotPinkie> What? Should I go for Dai-Guard with ponies instead?
<Dermathil> NewDCD that would be flipping awesome.
<Winter-puff> WANT NOW DCD
<Dermathil> I wonder. What pony would Justice be?%
<RobotPinkie> Well, they already kinda did the magical girls thing in season 1
<RobotPinkie> lets see them do Magic Knight Rayearth for season 2
<NewDCD> 9http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/18116?search=super_robot_wars
<Dermathil> (Dai-Guard pilot is justice-like)
<NewDCD> 9PONIS IN DAI-GUARD
<Dermathil> OH RIGHT
<Dermathil> Scoot is everypilot
<Jon> Hers is the drill that will pierce the heavens?
<Quanyails> 7Hrm...
<Sumica> wrong drill =p
*Quanyails 7decides to ninja-upload that drawing.
<Dermathil> ^^
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<Jon> ...*shrug*You can always use a drill.
<RobotPinkie> Hers is the scoots that will scoot all over heaven
<NewDCD> 9Dai-Guard's is the Drill of Awesome Suckage
<Dermathil> Is Scoot simon too?
<Solarboy> Holy bananas! Super Robot Taise.
<Sumica> that just sounds wrong
<Jon> Awesome...suckage?
<Dermathil> ohai Solarboy
<Jon> *blinkblink*
<NewDCD> 9if you watch the series
<Solarboy> Wich SRT is this? Hi Dermathil, do I know you? o_o
<NewDCD> 9it's pretty much the most realistic Super Robot show till now
<NewDCD> 9SRWZ2
<NewDCD> 9because when they activate the drill
<NewDCD> 9they lost control of it at first
<NewDCD> 9due to FUCKING TORQUE
<Thetrollside> DCD you need to watch what ya type people like me will twist what you type
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> They took TORQUE in account
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Purple`Prose> Haha, the counter almost killed him
<NewDCD> 9we watched Dai-Guard here in BronyState
<NewDCD> 9the whole series
<Dermathil> yeah
<NewDCD> 9during this week
<NewDCD> 9in two days
<Sumica> toque but not mass eh?
<Dermathil> at my request I think?
<Molestia> Greetings, subjects.
<NewDCD> 9GO, SCOOTALOO F. SEIEI
<NewDCD> 9ohai Molestia
<Dermathil> Sumica, the only thing they don't take into account in Dai-Guard is the Square/Cube rule.
<Thetrollside> MOLESTIA
<Dermathil> Where if you put the size to the square the mass is put to the cube and so on
<Purple`Prose> The CMC would Pilot Shin Getter Robo
<Thetrollside> LUNA IS BETTER D:<
<Molestia> Yes, that is me.
<Molestia> ...
<NewDCD> 9Molestia
<NewDCD> 9I have a special surprise for you next turn
<Purple`Prose> CUTIE MARK CRUSADER SUPER ROBOT PILOTS, YAY!
<RobotPinkie> @pony The pony most likely to molest Molestia
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony most likely to molest Molestia is 8Sapphire 12Sh11or12es
<Dermathil> What mod is Molestia?
<Solarboy> Such a coincidence, I was playing SRTW earlier today
<Thetrollside> orly?
<Molestia> ^ Sapphire Shores
<Molestia> Imokaywiththis
<Quanyails> 7Okay, now that's done...
<Sumica> Sorry purple it needs to start with a C =p
<Quanyails> 7Off to do my other homework.
<Dermathil> NewDCD, are you DLing something again?
<mib_ts7jxk> @pony The Next pony to be molested by Molestia
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The Next pony to be molested by Molestia is 7G5ild15a
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9BRACE FOR IT
<Jon> Random semirelated question?
<RobotPinkie> I'm okay with Gilda being molested.
<Jon> How does death work in this game?
<Dermathil> OH YES
<Sumica> 42
<Solarboy> Oh colt here we go.
*Molestia marks Gilda on her list.
<NewDCD> 9TO
<Dermathil> MUGEN PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANCH!!!!!!
<NewDCD> 9THE
<NewDCD> 9MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<Thetrollside> hmmm
<Sumica> lol nice
<Thetrollside> @pony the pony most likely to kill molestia
<Steven_Magnet> 6 the pony most likely to kill molestia is 13Pinkie 4Pie
<NewDCD> 9A mech after Molestia's own heart
<Thetrollside> lol?
<Dermathil> And so a new crater was created on the moon.
<Purple`Prose> MOON-TOUCHING PUNCH!
<Jon> I think its dead.*looks at moon*
<Molestia> See? I'm so awesome even the streamer's game takes ideas from me.
<NewDCD> 9LUNA! EINA!
<Purple`Prose> GRAVION!!!
<Thetrollside> viva la resistance?
<Solarboy> If there is a 1° reason to play SRT it's the overly dramatic battles.
<RobotPinkie> Oh god manly tears moment in Torchwood. Fuck this show for making me cry. :(
<Solarboy> It's liek playing a Michael bay movie.
<Solarboy> Except it's good and has 20% mreo explosions.
<Thetrollside> so DCD how do you play if you dont understand the controls? just hope w/e you press kills something?
<Sumica> mech-ael baysplosions
<Molestia> aw, lookit the chibi gundam
<Solarboy> The commands are easy to learn troll.
<Solarboy> Most stuff is trial and error at the begining, but you get the hang of it really fast.
<NewDCD> 9or
<NewDCD> 9you could play one of the English SRW first
<NewDCD> 9and get the hang of it
<Solarboy> That helps too.
<Dermathil> SRW-J is good to try to get the hang
<Thetrollside> wheres the fun in that? 8D
<Sumica> the more en it cost the more it hurts =p
<mib_ls3mon> hi fellow bronies
<Solarboy> hi mib
<Jon> ...Did the mech just go underwater?
<Jon> *blink*
<Dermathil> yes he did
<Sumica> from below
<Molestia> One of the keys to a successful game franchise is to never drastically change the controls that work well.
<RobotPinkie> also online guides help with Japanese games
<Thetrollside> the japanses, how do you they work? Dx
<Thetrollside> ugh
<Thetrollside> japanese*
<Solarboy> Wait, why don't Gndams have their obnoxius theme like in the rest of the SRT games? D:
<NewDCD> 9is anybody checking the LQ stream?
<RobotPinkie> They work diligently and with lots of gusto
<Thetrollside> nope
<Jon> ...L...Q?
<Jon> *blink blink*
<Sumica> the what now?
<Molestia> This is actually the first time the HQ stream is working for me, so I don't feel like looking.
<Molestia> Low Quality
<Molestia> For people with lower bandwidths.
<Thetrollside> *cough*lunaisbest*cough*
<Silverscreen> 11ohai
<Silverscreen> 11agreed. :P
<Sumica> how many piolets did that one have
<Thetrollside> well
<Thetrollside> rainbow dash and luna

<RobotPinkie> Silly trollside, that's not how you spell Pinkie Pie
<Winter-puff> two words

*Dermathil is looking for the end of the split.
<LQPersonThingy> Is it just me, or is the LQ stream acutally ahead of the HQ Stream?
<Silverscreen> 11split? what split?
<Dermathil> the split in the game.
<Umbreon> 12so i left the bucket in my room until he gets back
<Dermathil> He's only got a limited series of shows to play with ATM
<Dermathil> no Dai-Guard or TTGL
<Purple`Prose> SCRAMBLE! SCRAMBLE!
<Umbreon> 12and i look over and there's the cat with the bucket tipped over and all the water seeping into the carpet
<RobotPinkie> Yeah LQ stream loads faster. Seems fine, btw, though I'm off it now.

<Dermathil> yeah, no Big O either
<RobotPinkie> and no Giant Robo

<Dermathil> Mostly Gundams ATM
<Nickario> ok @ Umbreon
*Silverscreen 11likes the musical score in this game.
<Nickario> how did the cat knock it over?
<Dermathil> the songs are amazing Silverscreen.
<RobotPinkie> Well it should be in every game, I love Giant Robo :P
<NewDCD> 9the creator of Giant Robo let for it to be in Alpha
<NewDCD> 9but after that, he died
<NewDCD> 9and the copyright holders haven't allowed for it to be since

<RobotPinkie> ohai barry
<Barry> Fair warning, some things will be more severe than the Power Rangers shows
<NewDCD> 9so more like Sentai?
<Barry> For instance, the bully characters openly insult one of the characters for her hair choice and her presumed sexuality
<NewDCD> 9Scootaloo F. Seiei, engaging target.

<Nickario> thats actually a cool combo name
*Espeon hides Angel_Espeon in floof~
<Purple`Prose> What unit would Twilight be in/
<Dermathil> I think the pre-show is youtube videos on request.
<NewDCD> 9Nu Gundam
<NewDCD> 9that much is obvious
<Espeon> 06It's like Fight Club. What happens there, stays there. Forever.
<Dermathil> alrighty
<Nickario> o.o
<Purple`Prose> I figured she'd be in a more magic-orinted unit
<Purple`Prose> like RyuKouOh
<FreezeFrame> Pinkie Pie would totally be in a mecha from Big O.
<RainBroDash> 10wat
<Thetrollside> RBD how many times do you plan on kicking me this time
<RainBroDash> 10>apple fritter
<FreezeFrame> The insanity of that series is right up her alley.

<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9brace for it
<Nickario> heh nice
<Sumica> again?

<Purple`Prose> Applejack would ride in Mazinger
<Nickario> you should make an avatar or pic of a character like that
<Jon> Moonshot incoming?
<Dermathil> MUGEN PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANCH!!!
<FreezeFrame> Rainbow Dash would do G Gundam, as she's the only one boisterous enough.
*Umbreon hides Nickario in floof as well

<Angel_Espeon> 13Yes
<Purple`Prose> So whou would Rainbow's Rain Nakamura be?
<Angel_Espeon> 13:D
<Purple`Prose> if Rainbow is Domon
<Umbreon> 12umbreon floof has scifi properties in which it turns Nickario into micronickario

<Zoroara> Megamicronickario
<Purple`Prose> What would Fluttershy pilot?
<NewDCD> 9the Dragon Gundam
<ValtheJean> probably one of the support bots
<Silverscreen> 11Fluttershy would pilot a giant robot of Angel. :3
<NewDCD> 9due to Sai's finisher being A FUCKING BUTTERFLY
<RobotPinkie> Pinkie Pie piloted Wing Gundam ZERO for too long, and look what happened...
<Zoroara> More letters por favor
<Sumica> She wouldt fight, she would be support.
<Espeon> 06what
<Purple`Prose> Fluttershy would probably be on a Capital Ship
<Solarboy27> Great, my internet and Nickname both derped :3
<Jon> brb
<stripes> lol Silverscreen
<Purple`Prose> What's the Cap-Ship that Lacus Clyne pilots?
<ValtheJean> so what happened to the giant interdimensional lizard bots?
<Apokalipse> High quality? oooh when did that happen?
<Dermathil> NewDCD, are you DLing something? It is lagging slightly in my 60Mbps Download.
<NewDCD> 9it's called "U.S.S. Useless Mary Sue Bitch"
<ValtheJean> lol
<Sumica> I was thinking one of the 00 support ships, the one that did't blow up =p
<Purple`Prose> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/43735?search=cutie_mark_crusaders The CMC would so ride in Shin Getter
<NewDCD> 9better?
<Dermathil> yeah
<NewDCD> 9it was youtube
<Dermathil> heheheh
*Nickario counters with the aura and puts Umbreon in Espeon floof instead
*ValtheJean wants to see a dynamic kill :P
<Umbreon> 12xx
<Ghosties> 4Just wanted to tell DCD that I'm having slight hiccups every now and then for the High Quality stream. And I wanted to ask him if he changed anything from last night when we were testing.
<FreezeFrame> CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS GIANT MECHA PILOTS! YAY!
<NewDCD> 9didn't change anything. It's probably because I had YT open
<ValtheJean> oh hey
<ValtheJean> that was a veritech
<ValtheJean> me gusta
<Purple`Prose> What would Rarity be in?
<ValtheJean> something flashy ;)
<Nickario> and lol! I just took this from my batman animated series DVD http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b88/nick-metroid/d7566b72.jpg
<FreezeFrame> Something flashy and classy
<Ghosties> 4Do you run anything else while Streaming, DCD?
<Nickario> Joker troll face?
<NewDCD> 9Rarity in the Nobel Gundam
<Sumica> now that I picture it I can see rainbow dash with a gundam. it could even have the hairdo.
<Purple`Prose> Nah
<NewDCD> 9the other stream
<Purple`Prose> Angelg
<NewDCD> 9but now everything else is closed
<NewDCD> 9good choice, Purple
<Nickario> Joker > Troll Face
<Ghosties> 4And you just started the LQ stream today right?
<FreezeFrame> Rainbow woudl have to be in something from G Gundam, though.
<Freyskol> o_O
<Nickario> correction
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<Nickario> >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
<Freyskol> Sleeping with a blue bird.
<Ghosties> 4I wonder if that's why...
<Freyskol> INTERESTING.
<NewDCD> 9yesterday we were testing with LQ as well though
<FreezeFrame> Definitely not Gundam Wing. Those mechas run on emo.
<NewDCD> 9I think I'll tweak the quaity an eenzy weenzy bit
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, and I was slightly freezing a couple times
<Damos> and we all know what blue bird that is
<FreezeFrame> (Which is why Heero's was always the most powerful)
<Ghosties> 4And now the stream is gone
<ValtheJean> lol freeze
<Apokalipse> My stream had no lag actually
<NewDCD> 9and it's back again
<Sumica> just reload
<NewDCD> 9lowered from 600 to 550
<Ghosties> 4I'm guessing my stream drops now
<NewDCD> 9quality difference should not be very noticeable
<Solarboy27> @pony Solarboy27's waifu
<Apokalipse> looks fine
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Solarboy27's waifu is 8Bo12nB13on
<ValtheJean> yeah it pretty much looks the same
<ValtheJean> though I just had a hiccup
<Ghosties> 4Either I'm not getting enough mbps to properly allow for fluid streaming, or it's on your end
*stripes has looked forward to his first movie night :) make it work damit
<NewDCD> 9how is it now?
<Solarboy27> I can't see the chat, I'm forever alone here ):
<RobotPinkie> It's fine here
<ValtheJean> this your first one stripes? welcome in that case :)
<Sumica> 5by5
<FreezeFrame> @pony The pony most appropriate to play Domon Kashu, King of Hearts,
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony most appropriate to play Domon Kashu, King of Hearts, is 8Bo12nB13on
<Ghosties> 4Well, it's not like the stream freezes every two seconds. It's sporadic, so I can't really gauge the quality of a frozen stream
<ValtheJean> I can let you know every time it freezes
<ValtheJean> but like ghosties said, it isn't consistent
<NewDCD> 9please do so
<RobotPinkie> @pony The bonbonest bonbon in the entire world
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The bonbonest bonbon in the entire world is 5A8ce
<Apokalipse> Doesn't freeze for me. It did before when you had Youtube open
<NewDCD> 9I want zero freezes
<Ghosties> 4I'm guessing it freezes for Val too?
<ValtheJean> eeyup
<Ghosties> 4How's your mbps, Val?
<Silverscreen> 11if you're referring to the HQ stream, mine is running smoothly
<ValtheJean> eh...not sure...last time I checked it was like...I don't even remember...19? 16? I dunno
<Sumica> been fine here from the point you stoped OOO
<ValtheJean> I forgot the link to check >.<
<RobotPinkie> Myeah HQ stream is fine.
<NewDCD> 9speedtest.net
<Dermathil> if yer wondering, mine's 63.06. and I get slight lag.
<Dermathil> one every two minutes or so
<ValtheJean> there
<Dermathil> *once
<ValtheJean> just had one
<Ghosties> 4Silver, weren't you having problems last night wit hthe stream?
<Silverscreen> 11Yes I was.
<ValtheJean> and there
<Ghosties> 4It's hiccuping
<Ghosties> 4The stream, that is
<Silverscreen> 11And suddenly a hiccup
<RobotPinkie> oh, actually got a short hiccup there
<Silverscreen> 11that was weird.
<Ghosties> 4Freeze
<Dermathil> again
<ValtheJean> there
<RobotPinkie> and again
<Angel_Espeon> 13asdfgh
<NewDCD> 9there
<NewDCD> 9lowered bandwidth consumption a bit
<Angel_Espeon> 13adorable Touhou and Puella Magi-related images http://danbooru.donmai.us/post?tags=haru_%28kyou%29&commit=Search
<Zoroara> Ra
<Angel_Espeon> 13<3
<NewDCD> 9from now on, it should run pretty smooth
<Ghosties> 4As long as it allows for fluid streaming with no freezes or hiccups
<Zoroara> OK
<Zoroara> That's adorable
<NewDCD> 9how is it right now?
<ValtheJean> apparently my download speed is 11 right now, though I am running 3ds max here...which drains memory like a bitch
<RobotPinkie> No freeze again thus far.
<ValtheJean> well it's fine now, but again it happens randomly, not consistently
<Ghosties> 4slight hiccup
<ValtheJean> the best I can do is let you know whenever it happens
<Nickario> http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b88/nick-metroid/trollfaces.jpg
<Ghosties> 4It appears to happen during battle sequences
<Nickario> the similarities...o0

<ValtheJean> well, it was happening to me too if that contributes

<Nickario> but I just happened to notice that face as I paused the DVD to go get a drink o0
<NewDCD> 9that's just my PSP
<Nickario> I was like OMFG ITS TROLLFACE
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<NewDCD> 9when you connect both an USB cable and a cable into the audio jack
<NewDCD> 9they resonate and make that rumbling sound
*Nickario has potentially discovered a new meme!?
<Ghosties> 4Do you know what was causing the static before?
<stripes> ahhh...
<Apokalipse> I never noticed any static. Must have not been paying attention
<Espeon> 06I think I've seen a few Joker trollfaces before not sure if it was that particular one though.
<ValtheJean> oh, question about tonight's stream
<RobotPinkie> My speakers are shit, so no low rumbling, yay!
<Nickario> oh really? *googles*
<ValtheJean> how long is the movie first showing?
<NewDCD> 9yeah, it was my Stereo Mix setting
<NewDCD> 9I believe 90 minutes
<NewDCD> 9I haven't checked the running times
<ValtheJean> 90? gotcha
*ValtheJean doesn't want to miss the auction on account of driving home >.<
<Ghosties> 4Not sure about This Island Earth
<Dermathil> We gonna watch This Island Earth or Scott Pilgrim first? I forgot
<Nickario> http://www.deviantart.com/download/153640040/Joker_Troll_by_GEEK_in_IT.png
<Ghosties> 4This Island Earth, Dermathil
<Dermathil> darnit.
<Dermathil> TIE.
<Ghosties> 4We save the better movie for last :D
<Sumica> jease that guy cant hit a dam thing.
<Thetrollside> if its a b movie its shit :S
<Dermathil> yeahGhosties.
<Thetrollside> or a comedy
<Dermathil> *Yeah, Ghosties.
<Ghosties> 4If what's a b movie, trollside?
<Ghosties> 4Like, any movie that's chosen as b movie?
<Thetrollside> any movie thats picked in here
<Ghosties> 4...
<Ghosties> 4No
<Ghosties> 4Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes
<Ghosties> 4All those beg to differ
<Thetrollside> i said shit or comedy
<Dashite> Dammit ghosties, you need to rig the draw for me!
<Zecora> and spiders web
<NewDCD> 9>rig the draw
<Ghosties> 4Evil Dead II wasn't exactly a comedy
<RobotPinkie> Evil Dead 2 isn't comedy...
<NewDCD> 9>Implying we could rig the draw
<Ghosties> 4It was more of a horror film
<Dermathil> DON'T SAY THAT NAME, ZECORA.
<Thetrollside> it acted like it
<Ghosties> 4It had some elements of comedy, but it wasn't outright comedy like Army of Darkness
<ValtheJean> that's more that the main character was that era's equivalent of Jim Carrey
<Dashite> You're a smart guy NewDCD. I'm sure you'll figure something out.
<Apokalipse> The movies that get picked as a B movie here are either old, bad, a comedy or cheap
<Ghosties> 4Evil Dead II is the best example of a horror comedy
<Solarboy27> Scootaloo attack!
<Ghosties> 4Well, Apok, that's the point of a b movie
<ValtheJean> phfff, give me the B choice this week and I will prove you the fuck wrong :P
<Dashite> Attack of the killer scootaloo's
<Ghosties> 4I mean, I personally believe Army of Darkness was badass
<Ghosties> 4And good
<Apokalipse> I'd go on a rant about B movies again, but I'm sure you know how it goes by now
<RobotPinkie> WTF is his name "Lock On"?
<Dashite> That's because Army of Darkness is both those things.
<ValtheJean> lol

<Sumica> oh no it's plot deaths
<ValtheJean> OIY...ME MOIRA....ME PATRICK!
<stripes> interesting how its freezing for some ponies, im on a usb stick modem and eeepc at work! conected at 256k!

<Zoroara> The demo was on the internet within a matter of hours
<NewDCD> 9GUNDAM
<Dermathil> RAINBOWDASH ATTACK!
<Solarboy27> Red mode activated!

<NewDCD> 9ORE GA
<RobotPinkie> REAL JUST GOT SHIT
<Dermathil> FREEZE
<NewDCD> 9KONO GUNDAMU DE!
<Silverscreen> 11FREEZEFRAME!
<ValtheJean> O_o
<Solarboy27> Jesus christ!
<Apokalipse> Anyway, about the B movie thing. I think you should call it something else. Like humorous movie (because we usually make more fun of B movies) and serious movie because it's usually more serious like Inception and has better production values so we can't really make fun of the movie being bad
<ValtheJean> 24....THOUSAND damage
<desertman2> that's a ton of damage
<Solarboy27> Oh wait, it's a plot fight. nevermind,.
<Ghosties> 4I want a firebird gundam
<Ghosties> 4freeze
<Ghosties> 4FREEZE JUST GOT REAL
<Silverscreen> 11A and B movie have been working fine so far.
<Ghosties> 4That wouldn't work Apok
<Apokalipse> It's confusing
<Winter-puff> well if your going to get the job done
<Purple`Prose> OHSHI-
<Apokalipse> for anyone that knows what a B movie is
<Dermathil> ValtheJean, TTGL has an attack that does 150K dmg in a cutscene.
<Purple`Prose> REINFORCEMENTS
<NewDCD> 9>enemy reinforcemnts
<Ghosties> 4So much rendering going on in the stream
<ValtheJean> niiiiice
<NewDCD> 9.............
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9episode preview
<Zoroara> That picture...
<Ghosties> 4Case in point, Apok, the A movie this week is Scott Pilgrim which is by no means a "serious" film
<NewDCD> 9we'll continue this shit post-MN
<NewDCD> 9since, y'know, it's preshow time
<Nickario> Touhou is the bottom of the screen scrolling shooter game isn't it?
<Apokalipse> yeah, but I'm sure we will make more fun of the B movie than Scott Pilgrim
<InsertCupcake> ooo
<Nickario> if I remember
<Ghosties> 4Still, it's not a serious movie. It doesn't work
<Apokalipse> Yeah and the B movie isn't alwayws a B movie
<Zoroara> Yep
<RobotPinkie> HAYAKU MODOTTE KOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOI
<Nickario> cos I thought 1945 was insane for projectiles, but the vids I saw of touhou!
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9gonna start the preshow
<Ghosties> 4Like when, Apok
<NewDCD> 9TRANSLATOR'S NOTE: That means "PLEASE HURRY AND COME BAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!"
<Zoroara> By staying at the bottom is a one sure way to die
<Ghosties> 4Can you give me an example?
<ValtheJean> Baaa baba baaaa baba baaaa baba barararararara
<Nickario> a hair could get hit lol
<Apokalipse> Like I said before a B movie is a cheap movie. Nothing more, nothing else. It can be good or bad
<Jon> ...I'm back DCD.
<Riders> Big O! Show Time!!
<Jon> Does that count?
<Apokalipse> That is the definition of a B movie
<Silverscreen> 11Anypony want to see what I've been working on recently?
<Apokalipse> by that definition Battlefield Earth was the exact opposite of one
<Dermathil> wait, Dai-Guard Babababababababa?
<Ghosties> 4B movie isn't always a "cheap" movie. The actual definition for what we have is "B/cult" film
<Jon> Shhuure?
<Silverscreen> 11meaning the thing I did just five minutes ago?
<Ziltoid> clopfic?
<Ghosties> 4So anything that's art house, cult status, or cheap
<Zoroara> Yes sir
<Apokalipse> Yes, what you have. And funny, this is the first time I've heard the movies being reffered to as cult films
<Silverscreen> 11http://i51.tinypic.com/10d9oup.jpg
<Zoroara> And yet people are pro at that game
<RainBroDash> 10My internet is hardcore derped tonight.
<Apokalipse> Just saying, that your definitions and the actual ones aren't the same
<Ghosties> 4We've done it the entire BMN history
<RainBroDash> 10 0.32 Mbps d/l...
<Zoroara> Beating yukari in no deaths
<Zoroara> Good lord
<Ziltoid> cool
<Ziltoid> lol rainbrodash
<Dermathil> Oh, Heromachine, Silverscreen?
<Silverscreen> 11si
<Dermathil> I recognise the style.
<Ghosties> 4Whenever you see us saying "pick the b film" we're implying B or cult
<Apokalipse> I've always heard it refered to as B movie in the chat, the newsletters and the threads
<Angel_Espeon> 13everyone goes through the "omg that looks impossible" when they first find Touhou
<Silverscreen> 11I call it the Ponyzord. XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13but once you're past that stage
<Ghosties> 4Because that's what we recognize as our definition
<Angel_Espeon> 13it's easy to get hooked |D
<Dermathil> Used to use that thing about 4 years ago
<Nickario> I've actually seen ppl complete the NES dragon's lair game with no deaths
<Zoroara> Because the videos often show the most insane battles
<Nickario> THAT'S insane!
<Apokalipse> Well if you have your own definition for a B movie that is diferent from the regular definition then call it something else is all I'm saying
<Ghosties> 4B/cult is anything art house, cheap, bad, or cult status
<Espeon> 06isn't dragon's lair that terrible like
<Espeon> 06interactive movie of sorts
<Ghosties> 4And Battlefield Earth was a *bad* film
<Ghosties> 4Real bad
<Espeon> 06that was re-released for the pstriple at one point? (like with many consoles before it)
<Apokalipse> Yes, it was, but it wasn't cheap
<Espeon> 06If not, sorry
<Espeon> 06xD
<InsertCupcake> There is no way BE was an 'a' film for sure
<Ghosties> 4But it was bad
<ValtheJean> phhffff >implying leverage isn't badass :P
<stripes> RainBroDash: , im only on 256k atm!
<Dermathil> there's a reason Battlefield Earth is part of the bottom 250 movies on IMDb
<Ghosties> 4That's honestly what we classify a b/cult film as
<RainBroDash> 10stripes... how
<Ghosties> 4those four requirement
<Ghosties> 4s
<Silverscreen> 11It's only confusing to people who actually know the technical term. If that's the only reason for needing to change it, then I don't agree with the need to change it.
<Apokalipse> Yes, but like I said before you're judging the movies by your own standards not the standards that are normal for a B movie
<Riders> This Island Earth is B in the sense that it's old and somewhat campy. It's a very good film though
<Purple`Prose> Do you know what my choice is for B-movie?
<NewDCD> 9and we're live.
<NewDCD> 9do you get signal?
<InsertCupcake> yup
<stripes> RainBroDash: , isb stick on eeepc at work!

<EspyLacopa> Rainbow-: Meh, I'll just play it on my Wii.
<COlimar788> 3DS will be worth it when it has games later this year. :P
<DragonRage> Especially New Vegas itself. I've been to Vegas, it should've been much bigger and stuff.

<Dermathil> FLUTTERPEANUT
<The_Artificer> Trixie is best pony
<nah> technically, they never said wings were off limits.
<Pegacorn> DOUBLE JUMP.PROBLEM?
<sotha> The only place Oblivion beats out Morrowind is graphics and an improved gameplay system, both of which can be attributed to its being five years newer.
<Dermathil> how are you?
<InsertKeksy> Lyra wins all events
<Hipster_Brony> 8o hai peanut

<Dman> Are there more RBD>AJ bronies here than AJ>RBD?
<Ghosties> 4And Morrowind is just the better game. There was an element of discovery and a lack of narrative urgency that immersed me much more than Oblivion did
<Combustiblelemons> pony stark is the iron pony.
<Flutterpeanut> 13I am a mysterious pony. Bwahahaha.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> She peanut BUTTER jelly
<Aponymous> No, Pony Stark is Dash.

<techdude300> This remeinds me of a clopfic I read....
<Xharn> Kent Brockpony: "We now go over to Pinkie Pie in the Sky! Whats the weather Pinkie?"
<Ghosties> 4Morrowind has plenty of good mods
<lossthief> ghosties both act like jerks in this one. Dash's competitiveness started it, but AJ still cheats too
<PinkiePie> I am high!
<EspyLacopa> LordEchimaru: She's high on life.
<DAT_PON-3> PINKIE STOLE TWILIGHT'S BALLOON
<PinkiePie> High up!
<Trooper7psp> pinkiespike :

<coonasspinkiepie> 42!
<pony_why> 42
<Ghosties> 4Perhaps, but it's Dash's fault for it
<DrForester> AJ challenges a Pegasus to competition, and expects them not to use their natural abilities. RD isn't a cheat, AJ is just stupid n

<Rainbow-> What in tarnation.
<Gentlecolt> trees and mountains is best pony
<Vagrant> EGGHEADDDDD
<Kjakings> 7I thought you died due to a laser-based accident
<Gentlecolt> EGGHEAD
<PinkiePie> 42, 11, 8
<DragonRage> You know, we only ever see Twilight in that balloon twice.
<Rodman> Whoever gave Pinkie that job was high at the time
<lossthief> Really, in this episode, TS > both of them
<EspyLacopa> Pegacorn: Mostly life.
<Riders> Morrowind has a lot of great content and expansions but it is way too clunky
<Scootaleo> every time Dash laughs at someone I laugh too
<turtaguin> 0dash being a second tier species pony as well as being just awesome she is clearly superier
<Gentlecolt> HEAD EGG
<sotha> Morrowind has a much better world, an actually good main quest, way more content, better balance/level/loot system . . . etc.
<PoniesInSocks> I can't tell who is higher, Pinkie or the balloon.
<Trooper7psp> SPIDER
<LordEchimaru> Twilight is gonna be first
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> IMO morrowind is slightly better than oblivion

<Pikaru> Lyra runs on two legs.
<Ghosties> 4I don't care what none y'all people say, Dash's cheating spurred a reaction in AJ. Hell, and she's not nearly as nice as AJ
<caerdwyn> Well, at least one book anyway. Rarity's book.

<EspyLacopa> DrForester: Hmmm. Twilight gets her mark due to Rainbow Dash. Equestria is saved due to Twilight being Celestia's student. . .therefore Rainbow Dash is the original savior?

<Tyranico> Pony QWOP needs to happen. Maybe QWOP:ASKL Four limbs = extra hard
<COlimar788> The difference between AJ and RD is that AJ actually listens to Twilight.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> BARACK OBAMA IS BEST PONY
<turtaguin> 0ghosties , then again, with her competative "top of the world" attitude and personality, she would probably get much farther in life and be more successfull, but then again again, happiness is the true measure of a good life

<Rezo-chan2> Rescue from Midnight Castle has horrible pacing (It really should've been two episodes), but art & animation are quite decent for an 80s cartoon, and as stated, it's amazing to see how the main villain and his number two basically merged to become Luna/ Nightmare Moon in the G4 incarnation.
<RanYakumo> HIS LEG IS STL MOVING.
