<MI9000> HELLO MAGNETO!
<Spell-of-Gaming> Soupjuice: Don't shove your fucking opinion on others.
<JESmith71> They're splitting Hobbit into three films right? Maybe if Bronystate is still around after all the films are out on DVD we'll probably have a full Tolkein week here
<Kandarihu> I'm pretty much as nooby to this as I am to Harry Potter. Never read the books or watched the movies, even though most of the internet is so familiar with it that spoiler rules might be null and void.
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04He arrives precisely when he means to >:I
<Fenr> in my dreams,gandalf turns and incinerates him

<Murky> Faramir: next one
<Ersatz> That cart is so complicated and awesome
<MI9000> DA SHIRE
<Bubbles97> yes this is the extended edition
<EspyLacopa> Best thing about this movie is how much Jackson did without using CGI
<NullRadix> Faramir: shhhhh... you'll ruin his big entrance
<Kandarihu> Ladies and gentlemen, the acting talents of Ian MacCellan (sp?) will be performing the role of... Magneto
<Meanwhile> Faramir: From me. You're welcome.

<Bubbles97> My dream home
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15This is like our last HURRAH! before summer ends
<Cypresswolf|Cider> I think it took them at least 2 years to build the set for Hobbiton
<Murky> Are you streaming all three back to back?
<Gimli> 12,1Sauron: lawl
<prince-dari> They must have used some CGI
<EspyLacopa> Andy Serkis is best Golum.

<prince-dari> So CGI
<Fluttershy777> IS HE FAPING

<Gimli> 12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Sean Astin's father, John Astin, auditioned for the role of Gandalf.
<Colt_45> bilbo i hear is gay
<EspyLacopa> There -is- CGI in the movie, but they intentionally don't use it all over the place.
<Fenr> kids,don't do rings
<EspyLacopa> They could have.
<Fluttershy777> Smell it
<EspyLacopa> Very easily, in fact.
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04Yep, Riders. It's like last year :)

<Kurra> I gotta buy this version of the movie.
<PinkiePry> this movie is a great background noise for League of Legends :D
<Gimli> 12,1I love the extended cut. In the Theatrical cut, it felt real rushed and jumbled because of the rather novice editing job to trim the film down.
<Soupjuice> how did they manage to make that pipe?
<CiderIsForDrinking> Or now
<Riders> Just 4 more months until we see that story
<Bubbles97> aww

<Gimli> 12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: At the birthday party, when Bilbo is naming various hobbit families, he says "Proudfoots" and a hobbit calls back "Proudfeet", with his large feet in the foreground. The shot was deliberately framed to imitate the shot used in The Lord of the Rings, as an homage to the film that introduced Peter Jackson to J.R.R. Tolkien's works.

<Gimli> 12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Usually on a feature film, when the director comes to view the dailies, there's about 20-25 minutes of footage to be seen.

It was not scripted, but that take ended up in the final film.

<Meanwhile> Quitted isn't a word.
<Murky> And he did his own stunts.
<Michael> hai
<magmablock> In the book, Sarumon is described as having a voice that can make even the most inane things sound wise beyond years. In that regard, you really couldn't have gone with a better choice than Christopher Lee
<MrBen> Count Gandooku the Gray
<Squallken> yay Christopher Lee :D

<PitViper> Christopher Lee also originally auditioned for Gandalf not Saruman.
<Dark92Enigma> Hi Michael

<Boromir> Cypresswolf|Cider: the damn bugs
<RosePetal> Whew.
<XylemTube> NOOO
<Gimli> 12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The scream of the Ringwraiths is actually Fran Walsh, the co-writer and co-producer of the film.
<RainbowGuy> Great Hunter for the Ring who can sense it across the land: Get's distracted by cabbage.
<RosePetal> They stopped him just in time.
<Boromir> Gimli: lol how did she do that?
<Gondor> And none of the original voice actors are in the game
<IshSexiestPony> he hates it with a passion....fruit
<Sumica> 00,10Riders on the storm
<Kandarihu> Man, I was bitten by a mosquito about 15 minutes before the movie.
<Gimli> 12,1I wish they kept Tom Bombadil, but honestly, he really WASN'T important to the story other than filler...
<RosePetal> The power of darkness compels you.
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04I thought it was the Ringwraith being so evil that the insects and other creepy crawlers were drawn to his evilness
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Tom was just filler.

<Jim> All the shippings?
<PitViper> Tom does give a significant amount of foreshadowing about later events.
<cookie> bk
<Spazturtle> Gandalf_The_Grey: Nope they are running away
<Calcos323> The movie would've been a laughingstock if the Bombadil part was left in
<Sauron> 11,01The rest will be day-one DLC.
<IshSexiestPony> Rohan theres already one like that made by pokehidden
<Spell-of-Gaming> Wow, almost 1 hour already?
<abrony> frodo
<afKirz> so otakon would be in the game?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Rohan clean your mouth, you are drolling
<Gimli> 12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: One of the stuntmen dislocated a shoulder in the scene where the Hobbits tumble down off the road to escape one of the Ringwraiths. This was also the very first day of shooting.
<Sauron> 11,01Premium DLC.
<alexxm> Gimli no offense but from what i heard he's part in the book was just out of nowhere and never really explained
<PitViper> Plus, it's fun to speculate about what he really is.
<Michael> fail
<Cypresswolf|Cider> Tom Bombadil & Goldberry added some nice story, I thought
<Jim> afKirz, lol
<Sauron> 11,01Twidash is $5. Lyra x Bon Bon is $15.
<pikorar> Kandarihu: Oh yeah? Well I walked into a spiderweb, and found its host resting between my fingers.
<RosePetal> I have to follow him.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> afKirz as DLC
<Gondor> Sauron, if you don't buy it day one, you can't buy them later
<haberdash> Spell-of-gaming yeah LOTR is a 3hour movie
<Gimli> 12,1alexxm: Which is why I wasn't TOO upset when they left him out of the movie.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Two shippings, a straight and a same sex shipping, but the dialogue would be terrible and the ending of the romance wouldn't be satisfying

<Gimli> 12,1Didn't even ATTEMPT to fight back.
<Gondor> We should watch it on BMN sometime
<RosePetal> You idiot, now they are going to kill you.
<K_A> I remember this scene so well.
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04But that's Frodo's character
<PonyStationVita> oh man
<Sauron> 11,01Stabby stab stab
<Distant_Gaze> he mad
<Boromir> HE MADE HIS WILL SAVING THROW!
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Despite the Bait and Switch, I loved MGS2
<Boromir> but his AC was too low...
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04He's supposed to be the most innocent creature you'll ever come across in Lord of the Rings
<Calcos323> staaaaaaab
<CriticKitten> Frodo's a pussy through the entire series.
<Meanwhile> Suddenly Aragorn.
<abrony> :O
<Michael> then frodo dieed, the end
<Gimli> 12,1Eh, good point, I guess.
<DIZZYRATCHET> dat power
<MrBen> He attempts to use the ring to hide from them, only to realize it only makes him more visible to them.
<Kurra> Frodo's weakest class
<Boromir> CriticKitten: he's basically a sheltered child
<RosePetal> What sorcery is this?
<K_A> GG, Frodo.
<Gimli> 12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Aragorn battling the Ring Wraiths at Weathertop was Viggo Mortensen's very first day on set. It was also the first time that Mortensen had ever handled a sword.
<Boromir> Nazgul take critical damage from fire!
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Fire, BAAAD!
<RosePetal> FIRE BAD.
<IshSexiestPony> kill it with fire
<Riders> He's a freaking Hobbit, what do you want from him
<Navy_Brony> owww my face
<XaviortheSavior> fire fire fire!
<Boromir> CRITICAL HIT!
<PonyStationVita> its burns!
<Meanwhile> Good thing Viggo is a lunatic.
<Fenr> where wa gonfdor when the wraiths almost killed frodo?Oh wait....aragorn was there
<AttacktheAndalite> DEMENTOR?
<CriticKitten> So I guess Aragorn is a GW2 ranger who prefer a 1H Sword / Torch combo?
<IshSexiestPony> or at least try to
<Michael> owned
<PitViper> And that's how a real human king shows how it's done!
<RosePetal> I do believe I'm on fire.
<Malk_The_Texan> I wana be a ranger when I play D&D again
<PinkiePieYoshi64> HEADSHOT

<JakyBoy98> love that game
<Rohan> 0,14and then skip right to Revengeance
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04Riders has a point too. Hobbits aren't exactly courageous creatures, in fact I think it's stated as such throughout the films
<RivaLz> Aragorn is OP cause he is King...
<RosePetal> He's hurt.
<RainbowGuy> Torch in the face!
<Michael> MEDIC!
<Boromir> Samwise_Gamgee: sadly the DnD Rangers suck compared to Aragorn
<Murky> If by "1H sword" you mean "2H sword in one hand", yes.
<IshSexiestPony> and then burn the people
<Hat> Why do people I talk to always confuse hobbits with rabbits
*Kurra mashes his E key
<AttacktheAndalite> Wait, what happened to him?
<Kurra> MEDIC!
<Reikim> Well what did I miss?
<RosePetal> Take him to MEDIC!

<owloysius> we need a dispenser over here!
<Reikim> Ah, I see.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> This theme reminds me of a game, but I don't remember what
<RosePetal> Cuts back to evil lair.
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04Yay for nature~

<Malk_The_Texan> eeeeee
<PreciousShy> PinkiePieYoshi64: Star Wars?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> No, not really
<RosePetal> badababababababa.
<Gimli> 12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Orc blacksmiths shown beneath Isengard are actually the WETA Workshop staff who made the weapons used in the film.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15I'm not sure why, but it's impossible to run a stream, my PS3, and my capture card at the same time. :(
<Reikim> I would be interested if, say, Valve bought EA nd thus Mass Effect.
<JakyBoy98> whats the E kjey a refreance from?
<Sergio_Scriptor> eat it
<RosePetal> Butterfly.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Something like Star Wars, but not quite
<Fenr> Hi,miyagi-gandalf
<Soupjuice> Gimli, are you saying that some kids never weild wooden swords in childhood?
<JakyBoy98> kay*
<prince-dari> Giant weta?
<CriticKitten> Murky: In the context of GW2, you can't hold a 2H in one hand, and the 1H fit his combat style there better. Thus the joke. :P
<AttacktheAndalite> My god I keep getting ads over the stream and I have AdblockPlus on
<IshSexiestPony> Reikim you see clearly now the rain is gone?

<Cypresswolf|Cider> Gimli: do you have one on the moth?
<abrony> maaaaaahhhhhhh fooooooooooooddddddd
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Kill the Trees.... use them as weapons!
<Gimli> 12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The moth that Gandalf whispers to was born shortly before filming that day, and died soon after the scene was finished.
<Bubbles97> yuk..
<Boromir> Riders: he's been up on that tower for six months, he MUST be hungry
<RosePetal> NO!

<Colt_45> Gimli: ur making this up now arent u?
<Phase4> 00,02i've never understood this bit
<Michael> groaaaar
<CriticKitten> The bad guys are born from mud. True story.

<AttacktheAndalite> What the fuck is that?!!!
<PitViper> And that's were baby orcs come from.
<oneoneeighteight> ewww
<Gimli> 12,1Colt_45: Nope.
<Boromir> OohShiny: actually Radagast the Brown is more like FLuttershy
<Vordox> Gimli: And the Oscar goes to... Dragonfly!
<RosePetal> It's to show how truly evil they are.
<JakyBoy98> ahh ima go check out paintchat kk?

<Boromir> RainbowGuy: yh but JRR never explained HOW Saruman made the Uruk-Hai
<abrony> and thats were babbies come from
<cookie> brb
<IshSexiestPony> we need to stream Blackadder sometime
<CriticKitten> Spazturtle: Elves, you mean?
<Leadhoof> I believe...Uruk-Hai were once elves. And...somehow they turn into orcs. I feel like I read that somewhere.
<Reikim> Born from trees? So are the Uruk-Hai like evil dryads?
<RosePetal> His eyes are so blue.
<Dovah> .
<Meanwhile> ^
<Squallken> frodo had watched "robot seizers"
<PitViper> Uruk-hai the original half orcs.

<Meanwhile> Old English sitcom.
<Sauron> 11,01Hi.

<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Gandalf_The_Grey Orcs were.
<Boromir> Leadhoof: Orcs(and goblins) were once Elves that were tortured and twisted by Sauron in Mordor.

<Vordox> Everything is weeds for Hobbits
<Colt_45> samwise know shis weed..
<Murky> Orcs were once elves, Uruk-Hai are a Goblin-Orc crossbreed.
<RosePetal> Oh noes.
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04It's hard to tell which is which, honestly
<Kandarihu> MandelBrony, it's on your end

<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Gimli: And about that previous Frodo comment: Yeah, i agree, Frodo seem a bit more... independent in the books
<Kurra> I'm about to die too, speak softly at me... :'(
<Fenr> no,really?
<Colt_45> gimli trolls + orcs = urukhai
<Murky> Gimli: Goblins.
<PonyStationVita> :O
<MrBen> "Damn it, Frodo! Stay with us! DON'T HEAD TOWARD THE LIGHT!"
<Reikim> Oh my
<Soupjuice> where do you learn all this stuff, Gimli?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Into the White.... PART 1
<Boromir> pointy ears and all
<Kurra> no? aww.
<Bronysith> yes
<Michael> dat eyes
<Bronysith> mr bean
<Sauron> 11,01Sadly, I don't think Valve will buy EA unless Valve delists EA from the stock markte.
<Reikim> Mr. Bean is quite amusing.
<Bronysith> is so much win
<PitViper> Orcs were once elves, Goblins Dwarves, Uruk-Hai Men, and Trolls SPOILERS.
<Sauron> 11,01*et
<Boromir> Soupjuice: he reads up on it.
<Spazturtle> Yay we have the subs
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> perfect timing
<Sauron> 11,01*market
<RosePetal> Arwen is real.
<OohShiny> no frodo, don't go into the light
<Spazturtle> last time we didn't have the subs
<Riders> Damnit Rainbow Dash, down in front
<Michael> soo elves are medics?
<RainbowGuy> George Takai likes ;)
<Boromir> PitViper: actually goblins are just small elves
<Soupjuice> exactly as i thought! HEHHEHEHAHHAHA
<AlienWarhead> He had too much pipe weed
<Fenr> get to the chop....river!
<Spell-of-Gaming> PitViper: No spoilers. Even if there was a spoiler tag.
<Boromir> PitViper: Goblins are what Hobbits call orcs and small orcs.
<Sauron> 11,01Or Valve just buys a majority share.
<Colt_45> Agent Smith!
<PonyStationVita> pony!
<Reikim> So who's this lady again? It's been a while since I've been through this series.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Don't drop Frodo, okay.....
<CriticKitten> PitViper: I'm pretty sure the Uruk-Hai are a perfected form of orcs, which in turn are former elves.
<JakyBoy98> well im back
<lowfn> Rarity
<Boromir> and actually there is no Troll spoiler
<Gimli> 12,1Michael: Elves know natural medicines better than anyone else in Middle Earth, hence they are much better at healing than any other species.
<RosePetal> I'll send ponies for you.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Whoops, i drooped him..
<Phase4> 00,02aparently... whats his name who wrote the books was a linguist, and all the languages in the book were fully defined
<PonyStationVita> ya go pony
<cookie> oh my
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15yup
<Boromir> Reikim: Arwen, daughter of Elrond.
<Gimli> 12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), who is trilingual in English, Spanish, and Danish, requested the script be revised to let Aragorn speak more of his lines in Elvish.
<OohShiny> I want to learn Elven
<Dovah> wait, wouldnt going to the light be a good thing seeing as light=elves and elves=healing and crap?
<Michael> Gimli: IKR
<Bronysith> Phase4: j.r.r tolkien was a linguist yes
<Gimli> 12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Elvish language lines spoken in the film are not just quotes from the book, they were derived from J.R.R. Tolkien's own limited dictionary of that language. Dialect coach Andrew Jack used actual recordings of Tolkien reading his books to guide the actors' pronunciation.
<RosePetal> It is up to you pony. Save Frodo.
<Phase4> 00,02Gimli, bit hard to read that blue
<PinkiePieYoshi64> RUN, RARITY, RUN!!!! Dx
<Michael> that is because they are so avesome
<Michael> *awesome
<Reikim> Also, yes, Tolkien actually invented a language. He did that first, and THEN built a world around it.
<RosePetal> You can do it!
<Boromir> Dovah: yes, thus Frodo is crossing over to the shadow
<Colt_45> DEATH PONY!!
<PonyStationVita> pony ftw

<Fenr> she engaged the horse nitro tank
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Another scene that makes Frodo less badass: In books he rode to Rivendell by himself. Well, still better than Bakshi's Sam though...
<Gimli> 1,11ow...
<Gondor> Samwise_Gamgee, A
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04I could read the old color just fine, Silver :P

<AlienWarhead> Oh no water!
<Dovah> Gondor where were you?
<Boromir> RosePetal: elven horses do what they want
<Gimli> 1,11SirGanjalfTheGreen: I've seen scenes of Bakshi's Sam...I wanted to stab the fucker. He's ALMOST worse than Jar Jar Binks.

<Fenr> *starts retrofitting the toot shelter into a "one doesnt simply" shelter"
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04A lot of tears are shed
<Boromir> The Last Homely House On The Left.
<Distant_Gaze> He entered the matrix
<DIZZYRATCHET> im dying here
<abrony> heavan?
<RainbowGuy> George! Not now
<RosePetal> Gandalf is here.
<Sauron> 11,01Oh my.
<AlienWarhead> Boromir They said pipe weed though
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The voices of the Black Riders (Heard when they reach the shire, before Gandalf returns, and when Arwen carries Frodo across the river) were provided by Andy Serkis, the voice of Gollum.
<Vordox> Gandalf: Weren't you ontop of a tower?
<Sauron> 11,01Sumica has best pings.
<DIZZYRATCHET> call a medic
<RosePetal> At least this heaven is better than Harry Potter.
<Boromir> AlienWarhead: it's the equivalent of tobacco
<OohShiny> so, Harry Potter talking with dumbledore looks like this
<lowfn> Kandarihu: In be4 when I didnt know about tab, Your name was a pain to type
<lowfn> no offence
<FlyingShoppingCart> yay
<owloysius> planking
<richfiles> Middle Earth... Uses Gregorian callendar?

<AlienWarhead> Boromir Ok, but I like the weed jokes
<RosePetal> Planking.
<ObLiCody> gogo eagle
<Boromir> brb
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Arwen escapes from the Black Riders through the river by flooding them, the spell she speaks isn't subtitled. According to the Encyclopedy of Arda, she says: "Nîn o Chithaeglir lasto beth daer; rimmo nín Bruinen dan in Ulaer", which means roughly "Waters of the Hithaeglir, hear the word of power, rush, waters of Bruinen, against the Ringwraiths"
<Reikim> Gandalf has to stop being badass.
<lowfn> Kandarihu: Its k :$
<Riders> So, Saruman is the Highlander?
<RosePetal> STOP hurting Gandalf.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> He called Gilda? He should have called Rainbow...
<haberdash> shoulda rode the eagle to mordor
<Gimli> 1,11That title drop
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,158,2 How does this compare to my old colors?
<richfiles> Nightmare Night is just around the corner! :)
<Bjornfot> ;_;

<RosePetal> Hooray for Eagle.

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> wow
<Gimli> 1,11Gilda rede-nope, it's a regular eagle.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15I'm just tired of dark red and ligt grey
<Riders> Mr. Baggins
<Gondor> Welcome to Rivendell, Mr Anderson
<Kurra> FFFFF lag
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Oh New Zealand, u so pretty
<OohShiny> RosePetal the cake is a lie
<Boromir> okay guys, bbl watching Cowboys and aliens in the other room
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04Mr. Baggins...it's been a while
<Reikim> Hm
<Meanwhile> Looks like red on white from my perspective.
<ObLiCody> mr. anderson...
<Boromir> Gimli: no that was a GREAT EAGLE
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Mr. Underson...
<RosePetal> So, is he dreaming or ded?
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Mr. Ander I MEAN....Baggins
<Reactor> Choose one: cake >death<
<lowfn> Raise your hoof if your over 19 and still dress in costumes on Nightmare Night for fun
<Reikim> What were the options back when we were deciding the BS updates?
<lowfn> 18*
<PonyStationVita> reminds me of that pokemon movie
<cratorkid> ObLiCody: mt freeman...
<Bubbles97> awww
<Dismo> I can't wait for the Hobbit. c:
<cratorkid> mr ObLiCody
<Navy_Brony> No Boromir,you can't leave until you die.
<RainbowGuy> He probably just realized that Frodo could have just flied into Mordor
<Michael> friendship!
<cookie> Reactor: cake
<Meanwhile> Mr Baggins. Surprised to see me?
<IshSexiestPony> Bronysith I think that gave me cancer
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> :O
<XaviortheSavior> sumica
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Bilbo
<AlienWarhead> lowfn hoof raised
<Hat> \
<richfiles> 33... Dress as brony! :D
<RosePetal> One does not simply fly into Mondor.
*Bronysith gives IshSexiestPony the cure for cancer
<AttacktheAndalite> Brb guys
<JakyBoy98> well im 14 so ha
<Bronysith> i need to still read the hobbit
<PonyStationVita> omg adfs
<Fenr> he should uppercut bilbo for leaving him the ring tbh
<Azuredragon> lowfn, me
<Ryunosuke> Gimli, actually what gandalf rides out of isengard is a Giant Eagle, they are highly intelligent creatures
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04I have to say, about the coolest, most badass thing Hugo Weaving ever did was the role of Agent Smith in the original Matrix
<Ryunosuke> :)
<OohShiny> One does not simply enter mordor.
*IshSexiestPony takes the cure and it crumbles in his hand
<abrony> friends
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Although David Bowie was said to be keen on playing Elf Lord Elrond, the part went instead to Hugo Weaving.
<ObLiCody> yay its bilbo
<Reikim> Bronysith
<Gimli> 1,11...
<ObLiCody> :D
<Bronysith> right now i am content with the hilarious hitchikers guide to the galaxy
<Gimli> 1,11oh god.
<owloysius> back to the future
<Reikim> I am disappoint
<Gimli> 1,11David Bowie...
<IshSexiestPony> Damn you Bronysith, this is snake oil
<MrBen> No, technically they couldn't fly over. The eagles wanted no part in the affairs of the war from what I understand of the trilogy.
<Meanwhile> David Bowie as Elrond.
<RosePetal> Great Scott, he's aged.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,1510,5 how about this?
<Murky> ...no kidding Gimli.
<Meanwhile> The elven crotch bulge would have been fantastic.
<Kurra> David Bowie dear goodness :O
<Zawan> PonyStationVita: adblock
<lowfn> Azuredragon, AlienWarhead whatre you guys goin as?
<RainbowGuy> OMFG David Bowie
<cratorkid> its awesome because we are not even half way through :)
<Sauron> 11,01Mica
<Reikim> Failing to read the one LotR book that's actually easily readable
*Bronysith slaps the shit out of IshSexiestPony s cancer
<RosePetal> Dance Magic Dance.
<Hat> The Nazgul would have fought the Eagles if they flew over Mt Doom
<Meanwhile> That looks terrible.
<Reikim> Unrelated: God that's some ugly colouring.
<Calcos323> Hugo Weaving is a boss. He MADE The Matrix what it is
*IshSexiestPony punches Bronysith
<MrBen> They refused to fly anywhere near Mordor, let alone over it, IIRC
<Dismo> OHHH MY
<lowfn> oh
<lowfn> mai
<ObLiCody> lol
<PonyStationVita> and thats how equestria was made
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04If David Bowie played Elrond we'd have the Elves breaking into song every other scene
<Bronysith> Reikim: i did read the lotr trilogy 3 times though
<ObLiCody> oooooooh my, what a wimp
<Riders> Bilbo Baggins, he's only 3 ft. tall
<ObLiCody> :I
<IshSexiestPony> oh my
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15I give up! I'll stay boring
<AlienWarhead> lowfn maybe nostagic critic
<cratorkid> cratorkid: test
<ObLiCody> LOL
<RosePetal> Oh my~
<ObLiCody> so true
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Frodo is leafing through Bilbo's Book in Rivendell, a page with dwarven runes is shown. The runes translate thus: "Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks, and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole." This is a reference (actually a direct copy) to a map in the book "The Hobbit" and the runes tell of the secret
<Reikim> Well
<Gimli> 1,11entrance into The Lonely Mountain.
<RainbowGuy> The Eagles would haved had to fight Diamond Dogs with David B on the job
<Vordox> Bilbo likes to write Fanfics and Doujinshies. :P
<ObLiCody> so true.
<DIZZYRATCHET> oh my
<Michael> dat music is lovely
<Meanwhile> Your current colour works fine.
<Reikim> You could always use the dirty rarity colours.
<Ryunosuke> Gimli... David Bowie as Elrond... would he do a ... DANCE MAGIC DANCE?!?
<Fluttertree> :O
<lowfn> I'm goin as slenderman for Nightmare Night. :$
<Gimli> 1,11If David Bowie played Elrond, we'd be spending this time discussing his crotch. -_-
<RosePetal> lol david Bowie.
<Bronysith> did someone say dirty?
<abrony> lowfn lol ok
<Gold_Demona> The elves would be singing 80s music instead of this wispy stuff they're singing now. =P
<Dismo> Gimli: Shhh, It's okay. :c The Movie Travia monster can't get you
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04Noooooooooooo
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> David Bowie would be a decent Elf actually
<Kurra> INDEED GIMLI
<RosePetal> My son....
<AlienWarhead> >_><_<
<IshSexiestPony> Naughty > Dirty
<Fenr> damn...i'd like to read the hobbit again but i can't find my copy of the book
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Sexy dirty...or...you don't like her dirty
<cookie> brb
<Riders> Of course you're not like Bilbo, he is the greatest little Hobbit of them all
<Soupjuice> the scene in the book with the lock and thrush was indeed memorable
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Maybe not Elrond, but...
<RosePetal> At least it's better than rapping.
<PitViper> You mean David Bowie isn't already an elf?
<Zxan> Is there ever a point where music isn't playing?
<Reikim> I don't know, we just called it "Dirty Rarity"
<Doormen> Gimli: Instead we take our time saying Mr anderson
<Barbetos> Gimli he is not even in the movie and we are talking about his crotch anyways.
<RosePetal> No, there is still more to come.
<Bronysith> good dirty or bad dirty?
<Gimli> 1,11Doormen: An exchange I prefer...
<Reikim> It was the colour for the BS updates. Less painful than rainbow colouring.
<Calcos323> EXTENDED SCENE TIME
<IshSexiestPony> Naughty dirty
<richfiles> Barbetos :D
<Gimli> 1,11Barbetos: ...damn.
<RosePetal> Or will it?
<Spazturtle> nope
<Barbetos> One cannot escape it!
<Bronysith> hang on im looking for some pics
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> nope.avi
<Navy_Brony> David Hasselhoff would make a good elf.
<RosePetal> THE END.
<MrBen> Eeenope
<PonyStationVita> thats what she said
<Squallken> AGENT SMITH
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> *credits roll*
<AlienWarhead> Is "The Hobbit" going to be 3 movies?
<richfiles> Bt the POWER of Bowie's Crotch! :O
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yes
<CriticKitten> There we good.
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> AlienWarhead: Yes
<DismoBaggins> c:
<CriticKitten> Orcs and goblins.
<Calcos323> AlienWarhead: I believe so
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04<Doormen> Gimli: Instead we take our time saying Mr anderson <-- I say this is a damn good tradeoff
<RosePetal> He betrayed the LAW.
<IshSexiestPony> where have I seen that elf before?
<Reikim> If you really wanted to stop being boring, you could take the rainbow colouring and burn all our eyes out.
<AlienWarhead> ok
<ObLiCody> they're taking the hobbits to Isangard
<cratorkid> inb4 sean bean , the best actor ever
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The water used on the Rivendell set was brought in and contained chlorine. The entire water system had to be water-proof so that the chlorinated water would not leaked into the ground and contaminate natural water. After shooting was finished, the water used was collected back.
<AlienWarhead> RosePetal WRONG
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04Dat Sean Bean
<Hat> Watching LotR on Bronystate, best day ever
<cratorkid> SEAN BEAAANNN
<Riders> Don't tell me about armies. I've led computer programs, owls, and Nazis into battle
<CriticKitten> So the Uruk-Hai are a perfected form of orcs that has been mixed with goblins.
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04Nobody cares about Legolas
<Gimli> 1,11Gandalf_the_grey: That's what I said.
<Calcos323> And there's the reason why women decided to watch these films
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04Oh shit, herro Gimli
<RosePetal> It must be destroyed.
<Gimli> 1,11hai.
<Squallken> SEAN BEAN
<RosePetal> Oh I think girls like me watch action movies sometimes.
<OohShiny> Legolas!
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04Pfft
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04Men
<Soupjuice> nah, dwarves are pretty chill
<RosePetal> Hagrid.
<ObLiCody> i love legolas
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Lord Eddard Stark!
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04I once knew a man
<ObLiCody> :3
<Gimli> 1,11And fifty Orlando Bloom fangirls jizzed their pants.
<PonyStationVita> Suddenly thinking runescape watching this movie\
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04He ran me out of The Matrix
<Murky> What is a man?
<RivaLz> Gimli!
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04What good are men?
<Vordox> 50...?
<Navy_Brony> That's a long time to carry a grudge.
<Michael> dat scene
<PitViper> It's nice to know Elrond is tolerant of the other races.
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04Wellllllll
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Must've been hell of a trip from Whiterun...
<MrBen> Murky: A MISERABLE LITTLE PILE OF SECRETS!!
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04To be fair
<Legolas> Samwise_Gamgee try 19,6
<PonyStationVita> FINISH HIM
<RosePetal> I feel like I'm the only girl here on the internet who is not into Olrando Bloom?
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> :P
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04The elves and men both gave much
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,1519!?
<Hat> Extends neck. Nope!
<Gimli> 1,11"It's because of men the Beliebers survive"
*SirGanjalfTheGreen was also there
<Crippler> look at that smirk
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04And then Isildor just kinda goes "nahhhhhhhh"
<Meanwhile> If I were Elrond I'd have pitched him into the volcano, ring and all.
<AlienWarhead> Should have pushed him over
<RosePetal> Nostalgia Critic.
<Ryunosuke> so Elrond is over 3000 years old
<XaviortheSavior> No! Suck my big fat a meatball!
<Reactor> Should have pushed him in
<cookie> dat buffer
<CriticKitten> So....
<Michael> MOAR betrayal

<SirGanjalfTheGreen> "Mario! MARU+
<abrony> old
<Legolas> uhmmm wait
<RosePetal> DESTROY IT!
<Ryunosuke> he doesnt look a day over 30
<CriticKitten> Elrond, why didn't you just....kill him?
<Gold_Demona> RosePetal: He's pretty, but I'm not into him either. I like my men to be manly. :3
<RosePetal> NO.
<OohShiny> dat Diablo
<Squallken> KILL HIM :[
<Reikim> Hey, Isildor, you're an asshole.
<RosePetal> MARIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> "Mario! MARIOOOOOOOARGH!"
<CriticKitten> Stab his ass and throw him and the ring into the fire
<PonyStationVita> FINSIH HIM!
<CriticKitten> Tada, problem solved
<owloysius> where was gondor
<Murky> Because he's Elrond's brother.
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04This guy
<RosePetal> Nostalgia critic was better.
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor's throne when it's owner chose exile?
<Deadlypon3> ...So...Why didn't he kill him!?
<Gondor> owloysius, hi
<Buytoast> Nostalgia Critic is a hack.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,159,3 Your retinas are mine
<Legolas> yep or 10,6
<Reikim> I agree with CriticKitten, Elrond just showed some serious lack of common sense there.
<ObLiCody> because he is a dumbdumb
<owloysius> oh there he is
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The different colors of blue for the elves' eyes revealed what race they were. The Lothlorien elves had light blue eyes, and the Rivendell elves were dark blue.
<Reikim> Ow ow ow
<RosePetal> Banish him~
<IshSexiestPony> Samwise_Gamgee and YOUR jimmies are Mine

<Vordox> BOOROOOOMIIIIR
<Squallken> SEAN BEAN :D
<Gold_Demona> Gimli: What about the Mirkwood elves?
<CriticKitten> Especially since the fate of all mankind was at stake. One king is not more important than all life as we know it. STAB HIM and dump the pair of them in lava. >_>
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15nah, I'll keep experimenting and return when I find more
<AJIsAwesome> I'm back! Can anyone recap for me?

<ObLiCody> how dare he drop the hilt of the sword.
<RosePetal> Paper cut.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15You'll find that my jimmies are quite unrustled
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: There is no use running. You will be swallowed by the sheer awesomeness of Boromir.
<Soupjuice> he made it of the DNA from Beetle, Human, and Eel, and the spleens of 10 tigers
<Reactor> "still sharp", as if it's being used regularly.
<cookie> sword cut
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> oh my
<sonicdude558> What are the movies for tonight?
<Kandarihu> If it can cut the ring, it can cut your finger!
<RosePetal> Do you know how sharp that sword is?
<Soupjuice> he edjucated it with pictures of him in a dress
<Murky> What are you guys talking about? Boromir is still there in the third movie.
<Sauron> 11,01He cut himself. Now he'll die of tetanus.
*Meanwhile 13,8 Pink on yellow?
<IshSexiestPony> Samwise_Gamgee Han shot second
<Soupjuice> and then he gave it herpies
<AJIsAwesome> sonicdude558: LOTR, I think.
<Buytoast> that sword is more than 3000 years old
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,159,14 last attempt, then back to the movie
<CriticKitten> Much as I love the movies, it's small bits like that where you just go "people could easily have ended this story before it began, damnit"
<Buytoast> some durability
<RosePetal> It will cut your eye out.
<Sauron> 11,01No.
<Meanwhile> Green on grey does not mesh well.
<AJIsAwesome> DAT WHISPER

*sonicdude558 just that AJIsAwesome?
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15IshSexiestPony HOW DARE YOU!
<JakyBoy98> i has sandwich
<MrBen> sonicdude558: Fellowship of the Ring tonight, The Two Towers tomorrow night, Return of the King on Sunday night.
<Sumica> 00,10ah good i dont have to movie the ponies for subs
<RosePetal> But then it would not be epic.
<OohShiny> cookie 4 hours
<Reikim> CriticKitten: How did they deal with it in the books? I forgot.
<cookie> thnx
<Gondor> Samwise_Gamgee, do green on grey
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: taco bell
<MrBen> sonicdude558: All of them the Extended Version.
<IshSexiestPony> Samwise_Gamgee your jimmies, they seem quite rustled
<RosePetal> EVILLLLLLLL!
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Viggo Mortensen kept his sword with him at all times off set so that he could remain in character. He was questioned several times by police after reviewing his training sessions with the sword and being spotted by members of the public.
<PonyStationVita> its a changeling!
<Reikim> So yeah, none of those works.
<XaviortheSavior> mica
<Bronysith> and now the love speach
<Reikim> Pink on yellow is tolerable, but a bit off...try the inverse?
<Bronysith> speech
<MrBen> That must have been annoying for him.
<ObLiCody> lol
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, looks like you might have to movie them down a bit
<ObLiCody> that trivia
<RainbowGuy> Say, anyone know when Season 4 will start?

<Navy_Brony> wut?
<Rosfox> lol

<SirGanjalfTheGreen> :D
<RainbowGuy> 3 sorry
<AJIsAwesome> Can anyone bring me up to speed from the beginning of this movie?
<JakyBoy98> ohh maiii
<CriticKitten> Reikim: Same way. They really didn't answer that problem, in fact the idea never came up. Which bugs me severely. The fact that they send the Fellowship by foot instead of eagles or at least horses is equally mind-blowing.
<richfiles> MY NIGHTMARE MOON JUST SHIPPED!!! yay :(
<RosePetal> Look at all the cares I give.

<DIZZYRATCHET> waaaaaaaattttttt
<Reikim> I like you, Gimli. Taking the most direct route. Stupid, but to the point.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During the council scene in Rivendell when the fate of the Ring is being decided, when Boromir makes his plea for the Ring to be brought to Gondor, the "Gondor theme" can faintly be heard; in "Return of the King", this theme is heard as a full orchestral piece. Composer Howard Shore didn't plan out that this Rivendell background music would develop into the "Gondor
<Gimli> 1,11main theme" by the third film, but it ultimately did evolve into it.
<AlienWarhead> We need 10 tons of tnt, a nuke, and a chicken to destroy it

<Reikim> He's reprising Elrond for the Hobbit.
<richfiles> One movie per night]
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The large tree that stands above Bag End was built especially by the production department. Every leaf had to be manually attached.
<magmablock> Shit, four hours? I knew it was long, but jeez. Extetended edition?
<ObLiCody> aw man
<Sauron> 11,01Fun fact, we didn't do intermissions for LotR last year IIRC.
<Reikim> He was Megatron, apparently.
<Meanwhile> Literally. People would die of exhaustion.
<Meanwhile> Like they did last time...

<d3rb> stupid question, are we only watching the first movie or is this a crazy marathon of all 3?
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04I don't think we did, Sauron
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11Sauron: Correct. We didn't do Intermission...and it sucked. XD

<PonyStationVita> its a mystery
<Attack|Away> Intermission time~
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11Gandalf, we were tired as hell by the end of each movie.
<Riders> The only time we broke was when the Hurricane came in and said fuck you to the streamers
<Benickerson> That's what I was wondering OohShiny
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Thanks.
<abrony> i haz chipz who wants some
<Ersatz> You can play mann up with other people who are just playing normal, or so I hear.
<Azuredragon> BEEEEEEEESSSS

<prince-dari> To be honest intermission just means the film's going to finish later

<Kandarihu> Phase4, I'd assume it requires everyone to have a ticket. It's for access to official servers, and I didn't see anything about inviting others to the server.
<AJIsAwesome> MY BODY ISN'T READY YET!
<Riders> AJIsAwesome = Last year, the streams coincided with a hurricane along the East Coast which knocked out electricity and internet service temporarily
<lowfn> I wonder what would happen if there wasnt a single bit of stream for one entire day

They got it at a tattoo parlor in Wellington, New Zealand, to commemorate the experience of the movie. The ninth member, John Rhys-Davies, declined and sent his stunt double in his place.

<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04You know what I realized? In LotR all it took for the world to be like "Oh shit, Sauron's returned!" was for Gandalf to say as such

<Fenr> it's just,no one actually cared to much
<cookie> one day luna will own a movie!
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11Actually, Gandalf, the elves knew that Saruon returned long before Gandalf stated such, which is why they were leaving Middle Earth from the get-go.
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04I find it slightly amusing how in Harry Potter all of the wizard world was like "NOPE! NO 'HE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED' HERE! NO SIRREE!! NEVER!" until they actually *saw* Voldemort

<Riders> Starting my last year of college in 2 weeks
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04@Gimli: It just makes me laugh how all of Middle Earth understood the gravity of Sauron returning and didn't try to exactly hide it, while all of the wizard world had proof for the first few movies but kept turning a blind eye
<Hat> Is college years 11 and 12?
<Kencolt> I had enough "fun" with my first two degrees. I don't see myself going back to college any time soon.

<Shizuka> 13Gandalf_The_Grey: the super evil in the HP universe had only been gone for 11-14 years, so was still a fresh serious threat to be feared

<Shizuka> 13
<PonyStationVita> o gawd that courage the cowardly dog episode

<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The two most renowned Tolkien artists are Alan Lee and John Howe, and so it was important to Peter Jackson to have those two on board. Lee was tracked down to a tiny little village in Dartmoor, England and was FedExed a package of Jackson's Heavenly Creatures and a letter outlining his intentions. They monitored the progress of the FedEx package every step of the
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11way, but were somewhat surprised when Lee rang them only 3 hours after delivery to say he'd love to work with them. Howe meanwhile was living in Switzerland, and because someone hadn't worked out the time differences between Europe and New Zealand correctly, was rung about 2am. He says that the biggest frustration with that phone call was waiting for Jackson to finish his pitch before he
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04If Sauron be nothing more than an urban legend by that time
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11could say yes.

<lowfn> ObLiCody: That was a terrible pun
<ObLiCody> we are watching the first one
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Tolkien estate was never in favor of Peter Jackson's film adaptation but seeing as J.R.R. Tolkien signed the rights away in 1968 for $15,000, there was nothing they could do about it. Tolkien's grandson Simon came out in support of the production and was disowned by his relatives. Tolkien's son Christopher Tolkien later retracted any opposition.

<Ryunosuke> what are all these eggcelent yolks about again?
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: It is estimated that filming of the trilogy pumped about $200,000,000 into the New Zealand economy. The New Zealand government even created a Minister for Lord of the Rings, whose remit was to exploit all the economic opportunities the films represented.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15I can't break out of my shell, so I can't make egg jokes

<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The shots that were too visually complex to be conveyed on a storyboard were rendered digitally on a computer in a stage known as pre-visualisation. Peter Jackson received a lot of pointers on this from George Lucas and his Star Wars producer Rick McCallum at Skywalker Ranch. When he returned to New Zealand, he hired a lot of recent digital artist graduates to help
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11him create his previz concepts.

<VDX_Son_of_Lavalamp> Lawl pwned Boromit
<prince-dari> I still don't understand why Gandalf seems apprehensive about about Moria
<Fluttertree> run
<Reikim> prince-dari: He read the script.
<prince-dari> But a dwarf who has relations there doesn't
<CriticKitten> Dari: Because he's a racist.
<OohShiny> dem good eyes
<MrBen> "Unless I have no other choice." And suddenly he has no other choice.
<RaveBrony> Lol :D
<Kencolt> prince-dari: You'll see.
<Colt_45> gimli doesnt know moria is fucked
<Cypresswolf|Cider> My cousin Balin would throw us a Royal Party
<PonyStationVita> run ur fat asses!
<Spazturtle> prince-dari: He knows that everyone there is dead
<abrony> ravens
<XaviortheSavior> the birds! the birds!
<Bronysith> yea
<prince-dari> Surely Gimli is more likely to know than Gandalf?
<Fluttertree> damn birds
<Bronysith> return of the king extended cut
<Gold_Demona> prince-dari: Because the dwarf doesn't yet know what lies in the deep
<Bronysith> so fucking long
<IshBestPony> next year we're doin Dark Knight trilogy right?
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15prince-dari I assume Gandalf knows of the war
<Reikim> Like I said, dari, Gandalf has a copy of the script and he knows what happens at Moria
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11Prince-Dari: Gimli doesn't know about the [GOLD MEMBERSHIP REQUIRED]

<Reikim> Are we doing this all weekend?
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04Somebody's been watching Birdemic
<Fluttertree> fail
<Cypresswolf|Cider> Kreblin? Krablin? What are they called?
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> prince-dari: Gandalf is no ordinary human. In fact, he's not an actual human being at all.
<Shizuka> 13aaaaand it's an outdated server
<PonyStationVita> epic false acting
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Gandalf_The_Grey I saw that yesterday. Best movie eer
<Soupjuice> BIRDEMIC
<ObLiCody> uh oh
<abrony> snow everywere
<Benickerson> haha fail
<Shizuka> 13that is...
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: While the rest of the Fellowship struggle through snow drifts, Legolas walks on the top of the snow. This is in line with the information given in the novel, because Elves are so light-weighted that they are able to walk on top of snow.
<Shizuka> 13so sad.
<ObLiCody> this isn't good
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04Indeed, best bad film ever
<afKirz> ?
<Kandarihu> Back. Mom and I are dinnering
<Kencolt> Gandalf has... ways... of knowing things. Things he shouldn't know. Part of why he's the Wizard.
<Marky> Imagine zap apple cider
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04Though Manos is just as wonderful
<Bronysith> tf2 Shizuka ?
<NullRadix0> finally get into a TF2 server?
<Shizuka> 13valve utterly broke MVM with an update today
<prince-dari> I swear I read somewhere that they used a giant ring made of gold for that scene
<Sumica> 00,10still say it was a nice touch to have them all sloging through the snow while elf boy prances across the surface of the snow.
<Shizuka> 13we just waited 20 minutes
<afKirz> lol
<Fenr> ring goes on,ring goes off,ring goes on,ring goes off
<Bubbles97> birdemic is so bad its awesome
<Soupjuice> I hold The Room closer to heart, yet i still agree
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Frodo falls on the snow and loses the ring, a close-up of the ring with Frodo in the background is shown. In order to keep both the subjects focused, a giant ring (6 inches of diameter) was used.
<Reikim> What
<Meanwhile> Really?
<Rain> notice that Legolas is walking on the snow
<Shizuka> 13to get a server out of date error
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15awww really? I wanted to play it
<Gold_Demona> prince-dari: Gandalf knows WAY more about Moria than any dwarf does.
<Meanwhile> Sucks.
<AJIsAwesome> Gandalf_the_Brony: What movie?
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> The Ring hungers...
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11Prince-Dari: ironically, read my trivia.
<AJIsAwesome> Gandalf_The_Grey: What movie?
<Kandarihu> Birdemic: B-Tastic?
<prince-dari> Hah
<Soupjuice> indeed
<prince-dari> XD
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol is anyone else hearing "The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny" in their head everytime they see Gandalf? lol
<ObLiCody> i don't trust that one...
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> bad touch
<Spazturtle> Frodo is 40 years old here
<VDX_Son_of_Lavalamp> Kandarihu: E Tastic
<magmablock> LAG
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04I remember hearing that a Tolkein historian gave her blessing for Jackson and the film when she saw that scene between Boromir and Frodo in the snow
<Meanwhile> Can you not use phases?
<cratorkid> Sketch_Toku_Brony: nope
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11YOU SHOULD HAVE KILLED THOSE KEESE!

<PonyStationVita> lol runescape was my life 5 years ago
<IshBestPony> Samwise_Gamgee because your jimmies are rustled at night
<PonyStationVita> now its mlp
<Reikim> Secretly, Gimli is planning the moment he takes out Legolas' kneecaps.
<Kencolt> People lived longer then, and Aragorn has elf in his bloodline, from way way back.
<Kurra> Suddenly Nordic singers everywhere!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> This is making me think of freaking Icecrown
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> Frostmourne hungersss...

<Meanwhile> Christopher Lee was part of a special ops team in WWII iirc.
<AlienWarhead> The darkspawn
<Gandalf_the_Brony> go*
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04That's why Gandalf is apprehensive, dari
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The cast often had to fly to remote shoot locations by helicopter. Sean Bean(Boromir) was afraid of flying and would only do it when absolutely necessary. When they were shooting the scenes of the Fellowship crossing the snowy mountains, he'd spend two hours every morning climbing from the base of the mountain to the set near the top, already dressed as Boromir.
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11The crew being flown up could see him from their helicopters.
<Bronysith> pony34612: what is reikims fav anime?
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Protip: Don't dig too deep in Dwarf Fortress
<pony34612> Who does Lee play here?
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04He knows the Balrog is down there while the dwarves don't
<PonyStationVita> fire to the rain opps i should shut my mouth now
<prince-dari> Well I've seen the film before
<Kencolt> Gandalf has reasons to use his magic as little-- and as subtly-- as possible.
<Barbetos> That part reminds me of Dwarf Fortress so much XD
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Yes he was
<prince-dari> So I know that much
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> Sure, dump it on a Hobbit.
<Shizuka> 13saruman
<ObLiCody> lol
<ObLiCody> what a dumb
<prince-dari> But I still think it'd be more likely for the Gimli to know
<pony34612> Just /whois me, Bronysith
<IshBestPony> http://derpy.me/aTvYy
<Shizuka> 13silly rei identify
<Shizuka> 13or ghost
<prince-dari> Rather than Gandalf
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15and he showed the sound team what a back stab sounded like
<ObLiCody> who would want to climb like that
<Rohan> 0,14^
<PinkiePieYoshi64> So be it.... Jedi.
<pony34612> It's not letting me :<
*Gandalf_The_Grey shrugs
<Rohan> 0,14I was gonna say that....
<Barbetos> Dwarves, diging to deep, and unlocking hell itself. No really?
<PonyStationVita> woah bridge from legend of zelda twilight prin.
<LunarSS> Samwise_Gamgee: naw man you need the lava sea
<cratorkid> Samwise_Gamgee: need to play that some more
<Shizuka> 13that's dedication though, climbing a mountain in costume
<prince-dari> He has relations there and you'd think he'd be in contact with them every so often
<pony34612> Argh
<otakon> indeed Shizuka
<Reikim> Oh
<Reikim> Now
<otakon> and my goddamn stream is DEAD
<Gold_Demona> prince-dari: Gimli couldn't know about the Balrog because his relatives that took residence in Moria never knew about it.
<Reikim> Now I am Reikim
<otakon> the hell is going on?
<Shizuka> 13yes
<Gandalf_The_Grey> 04Yeah, Sean Bean is absolutely badass to climb a mountain in full costume like that
<Shizuka> 13yes you are :3
<PonyStationVita> it keeps happening
<AlienWarhead> Believe in the me that believes in you
<Bubbles97> MORIA
<Pink3ALT> Eeyup
<LunarSS> otakon: get better internets
*Rain lays down and leans her head into Shizuka
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11Gandalf: Agreed.
<prince-dari> And yet Gandalf does know?
<Shizuka> 13>Sean Bean is absolutely badass
<Marley> Not according to the books prince dari. Gloin reports at the council that they haven't heard from the dwarves there in some time
<Kurra> The dwarves dug too deep and ruptured the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. 8c
<Shizuka> 13is what you meant to say
<Squallken> Sean Bean is awesome PERIOD
<otakon> LunarSS: easier typed then done
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so who is the guy in the white? is he a friend of Gandalf? ive only seen 2 Towers and a little of RotK
<Bubbles97> lol
<Bronysith> dwarves <3
<Pink3ALT> Lol
<RivaLz> my audio is soooooooo bad i dont even understand Gandalfs words omg need to turn on volume to understand at least 50% of it
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Sean Bean has always been badass
<ObLiCody> i feel something bad coming...
<Pink3ALT> Eeyup
<Reikim> prince-dari: This is medieval times. Kind of. Getting messages anywhere means a long ride on horseback, and dwarves are already kind of reclusive.
<Pink3ALT> Eeyup
<Gold_Demona> prince-dari: They didn't live in that mine for very long, so they didn't know about the orcs and the troll and much less the Balrog.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15that's why he has TWO memes
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> "Mellon"
<Pink3ALT> Eeyup

<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: As Gandalf and the others leap the stairway gap in Moria while fleeing the balrog, incoming arrows shot at them by goblins high above seem to rapidly flex. This is not an accidental special-effects artifact; arrows actually do this, and it contributes to stable flight, similar to a gyroscope's effect. That one of Legolas' arrows does not flex in a flying-point-of-view
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11shot may indicate that elvish arrows are enchanted - or that the filmmakers just wanted to spare the audience the extra distraction in that shot.
<Colt_45> Swiftly Orlando bloom!

<Dovah> Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: Stone demon? It's a fire demon tho...

<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Gimli's line "Nobody tosses a dwarf!" was filmed after the "Toss me" line in the sequel.
<OohShiny> Legolas using AimBot, no fair man
<Ryunosuke> its not a fire deamon, its just a powerful deamon
<Reikim> Stone + Fire = Lava. Clearly or friend Balrog is a fiery monster from deep in the earth's core.
<Dovah> Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: sure, I guess.

<Rosfox> :'(
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The ironic part about the Fellowship mourning the loss of Gandalf was, at that point, none of the cast members had met Ian McKellen, let alone seen him dressed up as the wizard.
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04This scene
<CriticKitten> It sounds like the track is skipping in the background at times, am I the only one hearing that? O.o

<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04I would be surprised if there were a single dry eye in the theater at that moment
<Kencolt> MrBen: The reason is, they filmed all three movies at once-- a titanic gamble in the film world, but one that paid off.
<AJIsAwesome> Samwise_Gamgee: Yes.
<cratorkid> your crying is bad , you should feel bad
<Riders> You know what, I still can't let go of the Man of Steel music. My god Warner Bros. is lazy

<String_Shredder> Gandalf the Grey COULD NOT PASS!
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: More than 1,600 pairs of latex ears and feet were used during the shoot, each "cooked" in a special oven running 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There was no way of removing the feet at the end of the day without damaging them and so each pair could only be used once. The used feet were shredded to prevent a black market in stolen hobbit feet but apparently
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11Dominic Monaghan (Merry) kept a pair.

<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15I can see why most of these scenes were cut
<Benickerson> lololo
<otakon> Samwise_Gamgee: bc they add character?
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Orlando Bloom landed the role of Legolas two days before he finished drama school.
<Murky> It's also his second role, ever.
<ObLiCody> lol
<Ranger_Striker> :P
<otakon> Boromir is suffering from a Will penalty of -10
<Kencolt> Samwise_Gamgee: Mostly for time... even Jackson realised that the running time would be insanely long were they to keep everything in.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15otakon they're unnecessary. Everything you need is in the normal editions.
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During the Fellowship's stay in Lothlorien, Boromir says that his father is "a noble man." Denethor, Boromir's father, is played by John Noble.
<Murky> The first was as a murder victim on "Midsomer Murders"
<otakon> Samwise_Gamgee: BLASPHEMY!
<LunarSS> yeah the extended cut gets rather tedious at some points

<Bubbles97> yes
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Pregnancy changed Peter Jackson's vision of "Lord of the Rings". Originally, he wanted to cast Lucy Lawless as Galadriel and Uma Thurman as Arwen. Unfortunately, both actresses became pregnant after being asked to read, and the roles were filled in by Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler, respectively.
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> magmablock: yes it is
<PonyStationVita> it is
<Bronysith> LOOK AT THAT ELF

<Bronysith> omg
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Why not? Uma Thurman is awesome
<Bronysith> SHE TOOK Reikim s SIGHT
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Cate Blanchett's role as Galadriel required her to film for only a month.
<Meanwhile> Uma as Arwen? Nononononon
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> ^
<AJIsAwesome> Soupjuice: Cutscenes edited out of the original movie
<Vivix> I'm glad those two were recast
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04Thurman as Arwen? Hell no
<Rohan> 0,14I love me some Uma, but don't think it would've worked
<AlienWarhead> Soupjuice more screens are added
<Reikim> No, I mean, I HAVE NO STREAM.
<Soupjuice> ooohhhhhhh, thanks
<Rohan> 0,14I think these choices were better

<VDX_Son_of_Lavalamp> LUCY LAWLESS
<AlienWarhead> Soupjuice I mean scenes
<otakon> Rohan: but Uma is so HOT
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Cate Blanchett joked that she took the role of Galadriel because, "I've always wanted pointy ears".
<VDX_Son_of_Lavalamp> <3<3<3 I love Lucy Lawless!
<MrBen> Yar. I always found this scene cool.
<Soupjuice> thanks baby babies
<CriticKitten> I can't see either of those two being better than these two.

<Kurra> Oh my gosh, I'm in the future!

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Bad Ending
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04I think Lucy would have better than Thurman as of choices for their respective roles, but Cate looks much more befitting of an elf, I would think
<Bronysith> i did
<Bronysith> was banned from it
<Rohan> 0,14Cate Blanchett has this sorta of regalness to her
<PonyStationVita> the ring

<Meanwhile> Can't blame it.

<otakon> and NOTHING would happen if it touched the water
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Friendship is indeed.... strong Magic...
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04The right voice too
<VDX_Son_of_Lavalamp> Her eyes are her iconic stature of actress.
<otakon> SYMBOLISM
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> audio up
<Benickerson> that chick is creepin me out (O_O)
<Reikim> RP rooms are supposed to be pretty lax about banning.
<AlienWarhead> No pressure

<otakon> SHE HAS A RING OF POWER
<pikorar> IT BEGINS.
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> Jedi mind tricks
<Vivix> I think Lucy woujld play comedy well, but it would be really weird t osee her in a movie like this
<OohShiny> Boss Time!
<Cypresswolf|Cider> In the scene of the destruction of the Hobbiton Mill when Frodo looked into the Mirror of Galadriel, the model of the mill took over 6 months to make for a 3 second shot in the film

<Squallken> We need to have Princess Celestia do that, that would be so AWESOME :O
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> This scene scared the shit out of me when i first saw it

<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Over 12.5 million plastic rings were made in order to fabricate simulated chain mail for the movie. Two crew members spent the length of the shoot linking the rings by hand into suits of armor. By the end of production, they had worn the fingerprints off their thumbs and index fingers.
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11Dat ring

<Bronysith> those guys were kewl
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> o hai Uruk
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04I imagine real chainmail would be much more expensive

<Dark92Enigma> otakon don't worry, i know how this goes, but i won't spoil anything
<PinkiePieYoshi64> "Wipe them out....... all of them."
<Meanwhile> dari: To stab with a sword is an artists fight. Uruk-hai are brutes who crush bone with blade.
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The original plan was to film the trilogy in two movies. Miramax said that it had to be done in one movie so the producers went to New Line Cinema. When their presentation was done, one of the people at New Line told them that they were crazy and that the film had to be done as a trilogy. This caused the producers to go back and rewrite the script.
<otakon> Marley: yfw The Hobbit is gonna be a trilogy
<PonyStationVita> yummy

<otakon> dat Gimli is shamed
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> Rope is always useful
<Reikim> Also, not sure if Nitt is listening, but
<PonyStationVita> rope use it to climb ledges

<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: While filming the trilogy, Viggo Mortensen got so into character that during a conversation, Peter Jackson referred to him as "Aragorn" for over half an hour without him realizing it.

<Kurra> :D
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> Lothlorien Coat: +20% stealth

<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04Viggo was really into making his character come to life
<Meanwhile> Viggo Mortensen is the best kind of lunatic.
<Kurra> I LOVE that Gimli, being called your character :D
<AJIsAwesome> Is anyone getting skips?
<otakon> HOW HAVE WE GONE THE WHOLE TIME WITHOUT A SINGLE MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL QUOTE?!?!?!
<superretroworld> Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: where do you get all of this?
<CriticKitten> And he makes it work.
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11That's probably the best sign of a good actor.
<Marky> +4 intelligence

<Gandalf_the_Brony> Light of Elhendiel +10 Hope

<Ryunosuke> that line
<OohShiny> she said his True Name!
<Ryunosuke> Ron heard it
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Viggo Mortensen joined the film when it was already shooting, never having met Peter Jackson before, nor indeed having read the Tolkien books either. It was Mortensen's 11 year old son Henry Mortensen who was the chief instigator in convincing Mortensen to sign on as Aragorn.
<Riders> You get a bow that can't raise your already maxed out skill, you two get badass magic knives, you get a miniaturized star of magic, and I got a fucking rope. Fuck you Galadriel.

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> PinkiePieYoshi64 lol i see,oh plus the quote was funny since my name is Sam.lol not Samwise
<otakon> AlienWarhead: TOO LATE! It has to be relevant
<Beta_The_Grey> "She said no" ._.

<PinkiePieYoshi64> xD lol
<Marky> G'night all! Must be off.
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: While filming the scenes on the River Anduin, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies were swept out of their boats.
<cratorkid> im prety sure hair was a resonable gift up untill the civil war
<Kurra> Do you guys hear a banjo?
<AJIsAwesome> Marky: Night1

<OohShiny> Meanwhile it's because they drink a lot
<AlienWarhead> I watch you sleep
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Wherever possible, costume designer Ngila Dickson followed J.R.R. Tolkien's descriptions of the characters' clothing to the very letter. One such example is Bilbo Baggins's waistcoat which does indeed sport brass buttons, as referred to in "The Hobbit".
<Meanwhile> OohShiny: Yes that was the joke.
<cratorkid> ObLiCody: first worlsd problems
<Vivix> SirGanjalf|TheGreen: mmmm- those are the best rpgs
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15I used to have a friendship like Sam and Frodo

<Bronysith> and Rohan shall answer
<Rohan> 0,14not since middle school
<Reikim> Granted, the last time I tried was when I was 10. And I didn't exactly have the attention span back then.
<Riders> AlienWarhead = It's not the same!:[
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15My junior year I'll be able to take a class about Tolkien and his circle of friends.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15I can't wait
<Bronysith> i still need to read the hobbit lol
<PonyStationVita> lol i dont even have a ps vita i have a 3ds
<AJIsAwesome> cratorkid: I don't really like Naruto. I hated it when it got to Shipudden.
<Bronysith> but right now i am content with hitchikers guide to teh galaxy
<otakon> Dammit Gimli try to be a bit of a downer could you?
<AlienWarhead> Riders it's better :P
<Reikim> Damn you Bronysith. The one LotR book that's of manageable length, and you haven't read it.

<Bubbles97> I acn feel it
<Vivix> I love ruins
<AJIsAwesome> cratorkid: Chunin exam?
<Riders> Hated Naruto even when I was part of its demographic's age range
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> Samwise_Gamgee: I'm sure LotR Trilogy made a huge favor for New Zealand's tourism
<Bronysith> i read the LoTR trilogy 3 times in my lifetime
<Kurra> coming baaa-aaack again...
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I didn't know the Force existed in this movie....

<PonyStationVita> naruto was great until about season 3
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> Where was Frodo, when Gondor... wait
<Bronysith> Sumica: they need higher perception
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When the cast are traveling on screen, they always walk from the left of the screen to the right, never the other way around. This is because of the movie convention that West-East travel is represented by left-right movement.
<Rohan> 0,14Personally, I'd like to read The Silmarrion (still never sure how to spell that)
<Sumica> 00,10you bastards you blew it up!
<AlienWarhead> dammit Frodo don't spit the party

<Dark92Enigma> otakon What's wrong with it, Neverending story is actually awesome!
<XaviortheSavior> I am an adult!
<Reikim> Isn't that the one about Sauron's origins and the thing worse than him?
<Kandarihu> We're down to the last hour about now, right?

<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: A scene involving the Fellowship escaping the Uruk'hai via some river rapids had to be abandoned as extreme flooding in the Queenstown area had washed the set away.

<PinkiePieYoshi64> He's gonna run for it... D:
<pikorar> He's making like a tree!
<Riders> cratorkid = I had assumed that the ping effects were just a humorous soundboard. They seemed to sink up way too well to be accidental

<Buytoast> goddamn pippin is the biggest dumbass to live
<AJIsAwesome> MOST IMPORTANTLY, YOU GOTTA TELL SOMEONE YOU TRUST, LIKE YOUR PARENTS, YOUR TEACHER, OR A POLICE OFFICER!
<prince-dari> "Rolled around on him till he went invisible. Resisted urge to have a little cuddle (made easier when he punched me in the face.)" - Boromir

<Reikim> Fighting ones are very much a learning process.
<Bronysith> merry and pippen <3
<Sumica> 00,10they want us to find them, surly that's not a trick or a trap
<JESmith71> Yeah use the pings at only appropirate moments (Like the Oh My at a sex scene or whatever)
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> Hey, look, a distraction!
<cratorkid> riders its usualy somone just typing a ping when they know something is going to pop up
<Kurra> The ring makes you metrosexual?
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During the fight between Lurtz (the leader of the Uruk’hais) and Aragorn, Viggo Mortensen successfully parried the dagger thrown at him on his first attempt.

<VDX_Son_of_Lavalamp> GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SEAN BENN!
<Reikim> I still can't play them worth a damn, mostly because it requires playing against people and that's not really something I can do.
<AlienWarhead> Kurra What6_9
<otakon> LEEROY JENKINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04REEEEEDEEEEEMPTIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON

<AJIsAwesome> Crotch shot?

<Ryunosuke> unlimited arrows?
<CriticKitten> Legolas is a fucking baws.
<Sumica> 00,10some one took the quick draw and indless quiver AA's
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Legolas's arrows in the final battle are computer generated. It would have been physically impossible for even the most gifted archer to fire off so many arrows so quickly.
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Boromir uses Horn of Gondor *allies are on the way*
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: I think i know the lyrics....i'll PM you later about it

<Rohan> 0,14fighting games can be quite easy to pick up
<Beta_The_Grey> BLOW THE MAGIC CAUNCH!
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The climactic fight scene was shot in the middle of a heatwave, with temperatures in excess of 100 degrees. Many of the actors playing the Uruk'hais had to be carried off the set with heat exhaustion.
<Rohan> 0,14but getting good at them?
<otakon> WHY DID HE DROP HIS SHIELD?
<Riders> If this is a D&D game, Legolas is either a dexterous demi-god or he's cheating his rolls
<CriticKitten> I wonder how they managed to make Legolas's speed look so real, though.
<VDX_Son_of_Lavalamp> Come on Boromir! You're my favourite character!
<Rohan> 0,14they can have one hell of a slope
<Reikim> If you haven't learned DF you aren't allowed to complain that your game is hard to learn.
<Kandarihu> Legolas, Aimbot?
<VDX_Son_of_Lavalamp> Come on Boromir! Just a few more minutes
<Reikim> :P
<otakon> Riders: he's a elf, he rolled a 20

<Kurra> Legolas rolls a dice factory.
<Vivix> CriticKitten: He just pulled the string, aiming more or less towards them. Arrows were generated, so it looks pretty good
<Benickerson> holy crap there's a lot of them
<otakon> he got a 20 for dexterity
<Bronyhawk> Right there, that big Uruk'Hai...anyone know his name? It's from the card game.

<Kurra> Hey, Boromir would have earned that one TF2 Sniper achievement... X3
<OohShiny> Tryndamere ulted!

<IshSexiestPony> sexy time?
<PonyStationVita> overkill
<Biglaw> LIKE A BOSS
<VDX_Son_of_Lavalamp> Gandalf_the_Brony: He's so awesome he has three winds.
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Sean Bean is wearing a fiberglass bodysuit underneath his costumeto stop the arrows sticking out of him from wobbling.

*Reikim is horrified
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Boromir is in Critical Condition!
<Fenr> hobbits: highly ineffective
<CriticKitten> Kurra: Actually, given the locations of the arrows, you could live for a while with those shots.
<Rohan> 0,14because you cock up the netcode
<OohShiny> Tryndamere was slain!
<Benickerson> why not kill the guy who's shooting you first?

*Dark92Enigma cries in pain
<Reikim> I only skip the animation after the hundredth time I've seen it
<CriticKitten> Kurra: But it would be UNBEARABLY painful.
<Squallken> WHY DOES SEAN BEAN LIKE TO DIE IN ALMOST EVERYTHING HE'S IN :[
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :'(
<Beta_The_Grey> You know what the best part about being Sean Bean is? Being able to say "Hello, I'm Mr. Bean" :$
<Ranger_Striker> I FUCKING WANT A COPY OF THAT BOW!!
<pony_1396> Hammer X to extend bleed out time!
<MrBen> HOBBITS FAIL
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome: Only when inhaled, it is used in boats, cars, tons of things. Usually only dangerous if you breathe it in while spraying it
<otakon> Goodbye Stark
<Kurra> You would die just from the pain.
<PonyStationVita> FINISH HIM
<OohShiny> Tryndamere was slain

<PinkiePry> Wouldn't it be awesome if Darth Vader came out of nowhere, killed all the orcs, saved everyone, turned into a potato and implowded?
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15the lag on PS3 after someone skips is crazy. Like....powerpoint presentation levels.

<XaviortheSavior> sumi
<Bronyhawk> Kinda sucks that Lurtz wasn't even in the book :3

<Marley> dies with sword in hand = Valhalla
<prince-dari> "Killed by orcs. Stupid orcs." - Boromir
<otakon> Rest well Eddard Stark
<CriticKitten> Kurra: Pain doesn't kill you. Pain is merely a nerve-impulse response intended to warn you about damage to the body. You would pass out if the pain is too great, but the pain isn't what kills you. The arrows he took would cause him to bleed out while experiencing quite a lot of pain.
<Reikim> Man, the team on Nyx is doing insanely well.

<PinkiePieYoshi64> FRODO!!!!!
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the scene where Frodo is leaving everyone behind at Emyn Muil to take up the quest on his own, divers went into the water to make sure it would be free of any sharp objects or debris for Sean Astin to run into when Sam goes chasing after him. Although they gave the OK, Sean ended up stepping on a piece of glass that completely pierced his foot from top to bottom,
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11requiring a helicopter to transport him to the nearest hospital and several stitches.

<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11I have to say, even though I haven't read the books, I can just tell that the film followed the book to the T. How? because there's no bulky loose ends, no cluttered editing and no rushed scenes. A perfect adaptaion of the first book, an opinion that many, MANY share. 10/10

<IshSexiestPony> I can't, she's like 3 years older than me, and I think she already has someone
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03My OC TOTALLY fits in with the music :3
<Marley> Sorry, they cut a lot out and gave a much larger part to Arwen. Among other things

<Meanwhile> Tell her that the sun itself cannot shine light where she can.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: no seriously, wat movie?
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: Star Wars
<Dark92Enigma> Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: I completely agree. I didn't read the books either, but i can tell this <---- was a perfect adaptation of them.

<ObLiCody> everyone dance like a pony
<Rainbow-Crash> K_A: Nope, not on film at least
<Marley> Like I said, it would have taken ten movies if they really followed the book.
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: im sorry
<IshSexiestPony> :'(
<Riders> Still taken aback by how spectacularly well the effects and general direction hold up. If Hollywood is still remake crazy in 20 years, this is one film that does not need to be touched because it still looks incredible
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I could just stare at it all day...
<Kencolt> K_A: No. Jackson, rightly, that although theTom Bombadil scene was an interesting part, it added nothing to the actual plot, and wasn't filmed.
<otakon> Samwise_Gamgee: it was as close as it could get
<VDX_Son_of_Lavalamp> Scoot-Scootaloo: The music?
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15GOD THIS MUSIC IS SO GOOD

<Vivix> Look at all the carpenters!!!
<otakon> Kandarihu: same as usual, or a break
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04Howard Shore did an amazing job, he's a great composer
<Meanwhile> Sigh. There's a moth in my sleeve.

<Saigneur> Dark92Enigma:)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03<_<
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: do you have a moth fetish or something?
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11FILLIES AND GENTLECOLTS: Thus concludes tonight's official streaming of the first Lord of the Rings film. Please, join us tomorrow at 2pm EST (the usual BronyState stream time for saturdays) as we continue the journey with THE TWO TOWERS. Thank you, and Goodnight.

<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15:[
<Saigneur> 2PM EST ? what about GMT system ><
<ObLiCody> BUT THERE WAS BILL
<NullRadix> fffff... 2PM tomorrow... I might be stuck at work
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when this movie was so good?
<ObLiCody> what about bill
<K_A> Kencolt: Well, he was more of an initial guide to them during their travel through the old forest and was more for exposition, so I can see omitting him for pacing reasons.
<cratorkid> sean bean is the best for any male medeivel protagonist who dies
<richfiles> It's only 10.. No pony??? :(
<otakon> WHERE ARE THE LORD OF THE RINGS WITH PONIES!
<ObLiCody> bill was a pony
<Benickerson> I was told there would be ponies
<abrony> :D
<Cypresswolf|Cider> Fun Movie Fact - in the Director's commentary to this film, Peter Jackson mentions he has the Bag End set in storage in hopes one day he can turn it into a future home
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Saigneur convert it
<Rainbow-Crash> WHY DOES EVERYONE FORGET BILL
<Beta_The_Grey> there's ponies at the bottom of the screen, obviously
<AJIsAwesome> No pony?:'(
<ObLiCody> lord of the ponies
<Sumica> 00,10mfw 20 min of credits
<Meanwhile> You get a lot of moths around here alright.
<Riders> Forgot how incredible the Lord of the Rings soundtrack was
<Reikim> Tell her that perfection is a pale shadow next to her.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Bill's dead! Jim!
<otakon> Benickerson: that was only to get you here
<Bubbles97> Is bill still alive?
<Meanwhile> There hasn't been a day in the last month that I haven't seen one in here.
<ObLiCody> how could you forget about the soundtrack
<ObLiCody> i think he died in the books
<Reikim> They like you.
<IshSexiestPony> I...I can't do it. She'll reject me, and if will be difficult for the both of us to work there in the presence of each other, one of us will have to leave, I can't lose this job
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04Don't forget we had that intermission :P
<ObLiCody> did he not?
<K_A> Actually, a lot of stuff was omitted for pacing, believe it or not.
<Reikim> And your moustache.
<Benickerson> Dang it!
<Dark92Enigma> Meanwhile LUNA will find it by the Second or Third Movie, i guess
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11What is the time difference between Eastern and GMT? 3 hours?
<K_A> But I can't rate the movie because my attention is spotty.
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> 2pm EST, that's 8pm CET, right?
<Reikim> Okay then, guard your feelings, that's cool.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: im gonna miss the second one too. should i watch the third one or will it just be spoiling?
<Reactor> Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: I think 5 hours
<cratorkid> new zealand made a sh*t ton of money of of this
<Ranger_Striker> TWO TOWERS!! IT HAS PONIES!!
<Marley> In the book the hobbits ride ponies to Bree
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04So it'll be just over 4 hours of movie night tonight, with only one movie and zero pony eps (unless an ep is shown after)
<Reikim> I've been doing that for, what, three years now? I'm doing alright.
*Bronysith slaps IshSexiestPony
<Saigneur> it's only 5AM GMT+1 !!!!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03FUNFACT: Despite my OC, I am NOT a PC gamer...

<sub06905> Console master race? :P
<prince-dari> Should not have pony eps
<Sauron> 11,01-5
<prince-dari> Ever
<Vivix> We should have like clocks of the world over the stream
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: so should i watch the 3rd one? or not without watching the first two?
<Kurra> Jeez, 4am GMT?? Poor Brits and others.
<superretroworld> how come ive never seen those two ponies before?
<Sauron> 11,01-5 GMT actually.
<Reikim> No, actually, that's a terrible idea, don't do that.
<IshSexiestPony> besides I already said I think theres someone else in her life already
<ObLiCody> i wonder what pony episode we shall watch tonight
<Reikim> That's just fine.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15NONE!
<HavokOC> Whats the scheudle for tonight?
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15This was it
<Rainbow-Crash> Weta is best effects studio
<IshSexiestPony> :
<JESmith71> I think Sumi showing the four pony eps in-between the Potter movies was to make up for not having them tonight.
<sub06905> We need Gen 3 MLP Live
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> cratorkid: As i've said before; Peter Jackson made a huge favor for New Zealand's tourism
<IshSexiestPony> :'(

<NullRadix> IshSexiestPony: a) Don't listen to me, I don't know what I'm talking about. b) Get over it. c) Once over it, with a sound mind, ask her out. it shouldn't be serious when it starts anyway
<ObLiCody> the pony on the computer is raging by the more credits
<Meanwhile> Or you can steel yourself and stare her right in the face and take the chance.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15DrSteveSCARz tis an end of summer tradition

<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The fanclub members included Peter Jackson, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, and many other cast and crew members.
<NullRadix> But really, if you do nothing, you'll be stuck with never knowing.
<CiderIsForDrinking> So much OC :P
<IshSexiestPony> Well she does like black metal, perhaps a goat sacrifice
<Cypresswolf|Cider> ALL the Mod Ponies
<Benickerson> helloo
<Marley> Wonder if they'll do The Silmarillion someday
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> Man, can't wait for Hobbit
<Bronysith> Reikim: um...no
<AJIsAwesome> :);):D:(:O>_>
<otakon> Major: was that Daniel READING the Deathly Hallows? neat
<VDX_Son_of_Lavalamp> Lawl
<ObLiCody> what the heck
<Azuredragon> MORE
<ObLiCody> ._.
<VDX_Son_of_Lavalamp> Phase4 just: "TL:DR"
<Dark92Enigma> MOAR
<otakon> SirGanjalf|TheGreen: but WHY is it a goddamn trilogy?
<Bronysith> IshSexiestPony: kill a goat in front of her and drink its blood then
<Gimli_Son_of_Gloin> 1,11I need a desktop pony...
<DrSteveSCARz> Ponies .... EVERYWHERE
<ObLiCody> ermagod we get ponies
<Reikim> Don't do that that's a stupid idea.
<otakon> Seriously, The Hobbit is TWO movies at best
*Samwise_Gamgee doesn't have a desktop pony.....yet
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04Lol, even Val got one XD
<IshSexiestPony> still, no :'(
<Phase4> 00,02?
<Bronysith> otakon: why are they making the hobbit a trilogy? WHY!?
<Reikim> Make friends with her?
<Major> otakon: accourding to the description Harry Potter reading Harry Potter on the set of Harry Potter during shooting of Harry Potter.
<otakon> Bronysith: i don't know!
<Sumica> 00,10not Val
<Saigneur> where can we find those new desktop ponies U_u i don't own them
<Sumica> 00,10last one is Nitt
<Ranger_Striker> NITTANY`S OC!!!
<Bronysith> otakon: its not that even long of a book
<DrSteveSCARz> Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: I have an Octavia background
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04The one on the middle right
<otakon> Saigneur: they're cutsom jobs
<AlienWarhead> Bronysith Money
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04Isn't that Val?
<IshSexiestPony> I am friends with her, thats all we'll ever be
<otakon> Bronysith: I know!
<Dark92Enigma> Ghost_of_Gandalf: Val is the one at middle right?
<Riders> Marley = I can't see it being done. The Silmarillon provided interesting background on Middle Earth but it lacked a real central story
<SirGanjalf|TheGreen> otakon: Dunno, i've heard that Jackson will include some material from other Tolkien's works
<Sumica> 00,10that's Phase4
<Reikim> Being friendzoned for a year or two doesn't hurt all that much.
<Sauron> 11,01Val isn't a weather pony.
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04...they look so similar
<Everlasting_Joy> Hi everypony!

<Bronysith> otakon: hmmm....nah
<ObLiCody> david h combs III
<superretroworld> Bronysith: its a good book
<Rainbow-Crash> SirGanjalf|TheGreen: He can't include stuff from any works except LOTR and the Hobbit, since he doesn't have the rights. He is using the appendixes of the books though
<Kurra> They just opened a phone book and.... XD
<ObLiCody> garland t ConleyIII
<ObLiCody> what
<Meanwhile> You've probably been paying too much attention here.
<Reikim> Kicked from console.
<Bronysith> otakon: i have hitchhikers guide to the galaxy to read first
<Dark92Enigma> Does Shizuka have a Desktop Pony?
<ObLiCody> all of these thirds
<DrSteveSCARz> Looks like ima need about 16 sandwiches
<Kurra> So who are all these OC ponies??
<otakon> they ARE thanking the whole population of goddamn New Zeland
<Kandarihu> Sumica, lol.
<Marley> True but there are a lot of individual stories that would make good films

<IshSexiestPony> Bronysith:|
<Vivix> Marley: you could join the fanclub or pay to get on this list, so it's freaking massive and unrelated to the movie
<Bronysith> thats a terrible idea
<Reikim> Just as long as you're aware that it will be extremely painful and in the long run you will hate yourself.
<Meanwhile> Sith you have the most useless advice I have ever encountered.

<otakon> OH GOD
<Reikim> If a girl asks you out, and this is not a common affair for you, and she is not psychotic/deranged/insane, then the smart thing to do, Samwise_Gamgee, is to accept with good grace, go home, and praise Celestia.
<otakon> MAKE IT STOP!

<Vivix> Bob J Rabbit
<Reikim> People are people.

<Bronysith> Scoot-Scootaloo: how many computers are you going to destroy?
<JESmith71> ...did they do this in the other extended versions too? Will we see the exact same list of names in the other two films?
<Reikim> All in all, the moral of the story is that there is no "safe" way to deal with people. If you want to be safe, be a hermit. Each action you take in dealing with people is a risk; but in the majority of the cases, the gains will outweigh the risks.

<TheKoreanBrony1354> my mama told me life was like a bix of chochlates

<Cypresswolf> this site has just about all the G4 merch - http://www.strawberryreef.com/Index/Year/2011.html - if you're looking for a certain pony, it'll tell you if its a store exclusive or not.
<AdamTheDuck> No Octavia :(
<Cypresswolf> may take awhile for the site to load, there's tons of pics
<spitfirecolt> still waiting on my stuff my nightmare moon and zecora is on back order
<Cypresswolf> No Octavia yet...but there's a Vinyl Scratch in the Collectors Set, Hasbro most likely will have Octavia in the future
<AdamTheDuck> Mai waifu
<Jmo4267> No Octavia? ;-;
<Jmo4267> BOLLOCKS TO THAT!
<Cypresswolf> If they do a mucisians set - Lyra, Vinyl, Octavia would be perfect as a trio
<AdamTheDuck> Awkward moment when pony toys arrive in the mail and parents get to it first
<Sergio_Scriptor> AdamTheDuck: :D do they know you are a brony ?
<AdamTheDuck> Lets just say they are still wondering why I have Season 1 on my phone... :D
<Sergio_Scriptor> AdamTheDuck: XD
<AdamTheDuck> Whoa a glittery-transparent Fluttershy
<Cypresswolf> you think your parents getting to your pony merch is bad? :P Try getting glares from the cashier at a store with a basket full of pony swag - that guy glared at me the whole time & asked questions - is this all for you? Aren't you too old for this?
<Jmo4267> o.O
<Sergio_Scriptor> Cypresswolf: XD yep that is usualy how it goes
<AdamTheDuck> Haha, that must be very uncomforting
<Cypresswolf> well, not as much as looking behind me in line and seeing a couple of moms with their kids right behind me as he was ringing up my pony purchase :D
<Jmo4267> Haha
<Sergio_Scriptor> Cypresswolf: XD
<Cypresswolf> Oh the perils of being a pony collector :P
<Sergio_Scriptor> ^^^indeed :)
<Flyboy> i'm going to be hated becuase of this but, i lost my blind bags :(
<AdamTheDuck> Flyboy: Lost? Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<Jmo4267> D:
<Flyboy> in my defense, i hid them from my parents a bit too well
<Flyboy> i might look for them again now. brb
<Sergio_Scriptor> Flyboy: faillure sucess
<Flyboy> i just found them in 5 seconds -.-
<AdamTheDuck> :D
<Sergio_Scriptor> Flyboy: :d :D :D
<Flyboy> they were in a drawer next to my computer
<Flyboy> i only need fluttershy then i have all the mane 6
<Cypresswolf> Maybe they're secretly alive and wandered off on a toy story-like adventure - think about that one :P
<Flyboy> i have twilight, rarity, applejack, pinkie, dashie and big mac
<Flyboy> and half of them are on warhammer standd
<Flyboy> stands*
<AdamTheDuck> Trixi-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
<spitfirecolt> guys i had an awesome dream i dreamed that i had bought a toy pack of ponies that had vinyl scratch with octavia and lyra and bon bon in the pack with big macintosh
<Flyboy> ok then
<Sergio_Scriptor> spitfirecolt: sounds like a lovely drean :)
<AdamTheDuck> All I want is Octavia... :(
<spitfirecolt> it was
<spitfirecolt> same here adam
<AdamTheDuck> Understand the concept of love?
<AdamTheDuck> I'm going to stop questioning the sense of the lyrics of these songs...
<Jmo4267> Good idea AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> Dat sniper :D
<Sergio_Scriptor> I Wished MvM had an ability to join the robots,and then we could have more people :)
<Jmo4267> That'd be insanity.
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, like versus in L4D
<Sergio_Scriptor> AdamTheDuck: exactly :)
<Cypresswolf> I wonder if walmart sells poster tubes...I havent bought a poster in a couple of years, I have too many art prints & wall scrolls, wall space is nonexistent
<Dragonmatte> All demo team? AWESOME xD
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Dragonmatte
<Dragonmatte> I always either get into bad teams, or Tf2 crashes :S
<Sergio_Scriptor> Hi Dragonmatte :)
<Dragonmatte> Hai :3
<Dragonmatte> What is this song?
<AdamTheDuck> No idea
<Dragonmatte> Like my teams can't get through one wave xD
<AdamTheDuck> Lucky you can get into a game at all
<Dragonmatte> Yeah
<AdamTheDuck> Mine just goes time remaining: any second now
<Cypresswolf> I have a few 5' x 8' vinyl movie promo posters for Legend of the Gaurdians, how do you get something of that size framed? O_o let alone load it up and haul them back home - I think I need a U-Haul trailor and a giant artwork crate
<Dragonmatte> Once i finally do, i crash in the 2nd wave or something :S
<AdamTheDuck> to '?' and i'll wait another 20 minutes
<Dragonmatte> I've lowered my video settings, so now it hopefully works
<Dragonmatte> Hopefully
<Dragonmatte> Also finished my first mann up yesterday :3
<Dragonmatte> Got a robot scout hat :D
<Dragonmatte> So much win
<Dragonmatte> And it was like 15 mins before the servers were going down :3
<AdamTheDuck> I don't understang why valve did this lining up for server crap
<AdamTheDuck> understand*
<Jmo4267> One does not simply understand Valve.
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo4267: Oh you
<Jmo4267> ;D
<Cypresswolf> One of these years, I will get those framed...I just dont have the money for what I think they're going to cost to get just one of them framed
<Dragonmatte> I love the last waves :3
<Cypresswolf> I could turn this house into an art gallery :P
<Dragonmatte> THose are the best :D
<Jmo4267> That'd be awesome to see Cypresswolf
<Cypresswolf> It would be a funny looking art gallery - anime, foxes, & ponies :P
<AdamTheDuck> Black hole?
<Jmo4267> I'd love to see something like that.
<Cypresswolf> and a few giant owls in the mix
<Sergio_Scriptor> Cypresswolf: XD sounds like a deal braker to me :)
<Jmo4267> Dat braker :3
<Cypresswolf> I suppose that would be fitting - this house is already a zoo
<Cypresswolf> they're Legend of the Gaurdian owls :)
<Cypresswolf> does that make it better? :P
<Jmo4267> Dat Gaurdian. :<
<AdamTheDuck> It was already good when you said ponies :3
<Jmo4267> That was an awesome movie otherwise.
<Cypresswolf> Soren, Digger, Klud, & Nyra
