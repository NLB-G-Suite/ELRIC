<Amras0000> ok, now for new episode theories. I think Hasbro was trying to portray becoming a brony, what with first calling bronies gay/stupid, then falling in love with the show and trying to hard it, then seeing how much could be gained from admitting it.
*Gumri hugs back
<FreezeFrame> Rarity is not best pony.
<Havoc_Brony111> Git on with it!
