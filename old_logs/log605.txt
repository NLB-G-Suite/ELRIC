<ThePoniFromTortuga> Barbetos: Someone has to captain the ship so whoever's hand is on the weapon that kills the current Davy Jones heart, the person who killd is the new Davy Jones
<CriticKitten> Guncolt_somuchpony: Presumably, the script would collapse in on itself.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Stormy seas gone... :O :O :O :O :O

<Petrified_Pirate> BASS CANNON!
<CaptainGanjalf> FIYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<twilight_sprinkle> didnt they have an entire armada?
<Navigator_Vordox> Yeah
<ChartmanFan> This scene. is BAD
<ChartmanFan> ASS

<Darf14> Abandon Ship! :O
<ThePoniFromTortuga> And Michael Bay came
<AdmiralYahooz> its just, good buisness
<EonMastor> at this point, they should just fire anyways without the captain's orders
<PinkiePieYoshi64> the Endeavour is... Devaoured...
<RaveSwabbie> :D
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Yep. MAFIAA.
<Darf14> He gives up too easily
<Tyler_The_Creator> The Bronies are triumphant.
<Barbetos> Why would he break down there?
<Squallken> welcome too your grave lol
<ChartmanFan> You betray a pirate, you get shot. Less KArma and more common sense
<twilight_sprinkle> how did they end up in this position? i thought they had an entire armada
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> R.I.P. Demonoid ;-;
<RAWRity> Well tht's certainly an ENDeavor, hh?
<alexxm> well wish them the best of luck in their future endovers
<Meanwhile> I wonder how many times the the Pearl and the Dutchman hit each other through this.
<FirstMateMaidkim> Take THAT, SOPA!
<Barbetos> Why not just, oh I dunno. get off the boat and hurrt back to the armada
<prince-dari> twilight_sprinkle: The armada is still holding back
<Sinestro> seriously he didnt even try to open fire
<Tyler_The_Creator> awesome scene
<Navigator_magmablock> This movie is full ofepic deaths
<CabinBoy_Sid> dat slowmo
<PinkiePieYoshi64> That slo mo :O
<RAWRity> man, he must be great at dodgeball
<Captain_Michael> dat slow mo
<Tyler_The_Creator> FUCK
<FirstMaid_Cratorkid> buffer
<Tyler_The_Creator> NO BUFFERING
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: why arent they helping? im lagging hard so idk
<Barbetos> he must really LOVE that ship
<Lasharus> You mean dat buffer.
<Deadlypon3> Such a awesome death scene for...a character we barely knew
<Malmortius> Fucking neos father.
<RaveSwabbie> Dat luck
<Navigator_Vordox> All dat buffer
<FirstMaid_Cratorkid> screencap
<pony_6288> name of the part ??
<Barbetos> like REALLY LOVE IT
<FirstMateMaidkim> Really, any illogic in this scene is pardoned by that one death.
<Darf14> Hes trying to make his death the best ever
<ThePoniFromTortuga> Meanwhile: Not sure but apparently the Dutchman and Black Pearl "repair" themselves somehow
<Meanwhile> Und dann everything goes to shit.
<Petrified_Pirate> And none of the splinters hit him. Fuck all that dude is lucky.
<Cypresswolf> and everything shatters behind him - Fricken love that
<ThePoniFromTortuga> EXPLOSIOOON
<diddutz> epic slow mo
<prince-dari> twilight_sprinkle: I suppose they're waiting for orders
<Lasharus> I mean, okay, technically it enhances the slomo, I suppose, but... no.
<Deadlypon3> WHy such an awesome death scene for this guy?!
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Nope, sorry, the Rebels have won. They captured the Dutchman and killed the Beckett. I'm afraid the entire British Empire has lost.
<alexxm> boom
<PinkiePieYoshi64> BEST
<CabinBoy_Sid> dead
<PinkiePieYoshi64> DEATH
<PinkiePieYoshi64> EVER
<pony_6288> nice
<ChartmanFan> Deadlypon3, because HE was the Big Bad
<Barbetos> Why would the do that.
<Barbetos> UGH
<Captain_Michael> we won!
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: so THAT'S why the pirates would have survived!
<ThePoniFromTortuga> VICTORY!
<Barbetos> I am gona stop thinking about this
<Quick_Thinker> 1 ship goes down so they flee WAHT
<DocSane> Load bearing villain
<CaptainGanjalf> Best death scene meets worst buffer:(
<FirstMateMaidkim> CriticKitten: It's like the last Star Wars movie all over again.
<Barbetos> Just enjoy the movie.
<Cypresswolf> Against the Flying Dutchman, there is no victory
<CriticKitten> I told you. Return of the Jedi syndrome.
<Captain_Michael> for celestia, we wonnn
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Its Star wars Episode 6 all over again
<Narolas> Well that's a stupid ending, i have to admit
<Sumica> 00,10they took out the deathstar, the rebals win
<Meanwhile> Suddenly pirates.
<Narolas> Never realised how stupid it was
<Sinestro> this defies so much of the British Navys history
<twilight_sprinkle> well that was lame
<Meanwhile> And then there's this bunch of assholes who did nothing useful at all.
<FirstMateMaidkim> > Take out Emperor + Deathstar > Entire Empire still remains
<Lasharus> I'm sort of unable to Barbetos. I'll download this blighted thing later and re-watch it.
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: except for, you know, how they just beat the Flying Dutchman like 10 minutes ago.
<RaveSwabbie> Lolwut
<Eulshy> Other captains didn't do shit
<CriticKitten> They took out the Emperor and the Death Star, movie over. Nevermind the entire fleet of battleships outnumbering them 10 to 1.
<ChartmanFan> It was an AWESOME ENDING
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I request Pony Throne room scene now... :O :O :O
<Ninja-Fou_Lou> Sumica: the rebels dont win in EP 4
<Tyler_The_Creator> French priates LOL
<Captain_Striker> YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Quick_Thinker> cept in the books the empire is still out there just not as powerful without a leader or large ammount of money
<LilB> "We did good... a i nothing" - every other pirate
<Darf14> Summons a whole army of pirates, only use one ship
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: why are you telling me that? i agree it doesnt make sense
*ThePoniFromTortuga throws her hat in the air
<Narolas> That didn't make any freaking sense, he didn't do anything, and the armada would have still attacked
<Cypresswolf> RAWRity: :P you spoiler
<Meanwhile> Now go and get it.
<CriticKitten> Jack's dad gives zero fucks
<Navigator_magmablock> So where were those other ships the whole time, just sitting there while the Pearl did all the work?
<Tyler_The_Creator> The bronies have won.
<Barbetos> Jack is already drunk
<FirstMateMaidkim> Ninja-Fou_Lou: Episode 6 they blow up a second one.
*CaptainGanjalf cheers anyway
<ponyfromPR> :D
<Sinestro> Empire still went on, even reclaimed the galaxy in 100 years
<Crimson_Phoenix> that hat
<RaveSwabbie> Lol :D
<alexxm> horray
<Ryunosuke> troll
<CabinBoy_Sid> lol
<Captain_Michael> for equestria!
<AdmiralSaxy> 0,14Battlefield Earth prompted the Leverage meme
*Captain_Striker throws hat in the air
<Barbetos> Mr Gibs is the best first mate ever
<Pirate_Spectrum_Rush> olol
<AdmiralSaxy> 0,14but that was before I was here
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Was answering your question. :P
<ThePoniFromTortuga> Hello Phase4
<FirstMateMaidkim> I remember that movie. Enjoyably hammy, stupidly illogical.
<Kandarihu|MaidsMop> Man, Demonoid. That WAS messed up how that happened
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: o ok :P
*Captain_Striker yawn
<Ninja-Fou_Lou> FirstMateMaidkim: EP6 the emperor was killed. That destroyed the Empire
<Phase4> 00,02ohai
<FirstMateMaidkim> So that's a pretty old meme.
<twilight_sprinkle> hai Phase4!
<CabinBoy_Sid> Ohi Phase4
<Captain_Michael> hai Phase4
<Meanwhile> I actually missed that one. Tbh.
<FirstMateMaidkim> Ninja-Fou_Lou: And there was a second Death Star involved.
<alexxm> how you doing Phase4
<Sinestro> It destoryed the Emperor, thats all
<RaveSwabbie> <3
<CriticKitten> "I know I wanted freedom, but I've decided that I have Stockholm Syndrome and I want to stay now."
<Kandarihu|MaidsMop> Phase4, I owe you a bit of an explanation of what happened last night.
<RAWRity> FirstMateMaidkim: and also something called a Sun Crusher
<FirstMateMaidkim> Ninja-Fou_Lou: Besides, as we have elaborated, killing the Emperor does not destroy the Empire.
<Sinestro> the Empire consided of millons of worlds
<Phase4> 00,02alexxm, i'm good
<FirstMateMaidkim> RAWRity: Wasn't that in the Expanded Universe?
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu|MaidsMop, ?
<Ninja-Fou_Lou> FirstMateMaidkim: why not?
<Admiral_Otakon> hiya Phase4
<sub06905> dat Phase4
<RAWRity> FirstMateMaidkim: yup. Also had the Galaxy Gun
<Admiral_Otakon> GODDAMN YOU BUFFER BE GONE!
<Barbetos> The first two decades will be fine
<twilight_sprinkle> Beckett mustve been so greedy he was the only one above the rank of ordinary soldier
<sonicandmario85> WHERES BAD HORSE
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Admiral_Otakon
<CriticKitten> Why can't she come?
<Barbetos> But after that she will totally be.... ugh
<Barbetos> So... ugly
<RAWRity> and then.........pregnancy.
<Sinestro> and the Rebels didnt do that great once they became the republic, nearly died every other year
<otakon> there we go
*Bronysith glomps Phase4
<otakon> brb guys
<CriticKitten> Can't she just resign from the Pirate King job and, like, sign up on his crew?
<Ninja-Fou_Lou> FirstMateMaidkim: it makes the rebellion a hell of a lot easier
<Phase4> 00,02RAWRity, does the galaxy gun fire galaxys?
<Barbetos> And Will... well will be not old.
<Kandarihu|MaidsMop> When I got off of Magicka, it's because my mom had to take up her laptop. My old computer that cannot run Magicka was up, so I got onto IRC on that machine.
*Phase4 00,02hugs Bronysith back
<FirstMateMaidkim> Ninja-Fou_Lou: Infrastructure, chain of command, they're all still there.
<RAWRity> Phase4: it DESTROYS galaxies
<alexxm> poppet
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01I think pirates of the old days were, in ways, like internet pirates of today.
<Franek12354> lags a bit :|
<Phase4> 00,02close enough
<FirstMateMaidkim> Ninja-Fou_Lou: If anything, it would make the rebellion harder; they're now even more of a target.
<Sinestro> Thrawn was all the Empire needed to take control back
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Fighting against greedy companies.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> For now on, this film series shall be known as: "Sea Wars"
<Barbetos> Jack is now GAY!
<Kandarihu|MaidsMop> Captain_Maid_Discord, no they weren't. They were bad news.
<RaveSwabbie> =_(\
<FirstMateMaidkim> RAWRity: Bullshit weapon. Whoever wrote that story was crazy.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: She carried the child, she gave birth....she can't explain what happened.
<Vivix|Stuff> and bankrupting indie companies
<LilB> I like that there ae 8 pirate lords with hundrets of ships, yet Jack and Barbossa have to share this one ship XD
<twilight_sprinkle> Captain_Maid_Discord: and surfing the vast oceans of the internet
<Pirate_Spectrum_Rush> Oh MAAIIIIII
<Captain_Michael> lol
<Barbetos> Kiss a woman, and gets killed for it, put the gay right into him it did.
<Malmortius> So now will is IMMORTAL?
<Meanwhile> Buffering.
<Meanwhile> Really.
<RustyMeat> dat leg
<RaveSwabbie> Oh damn
<Barbetos> Honey moon time
<Crimson_Phoenix> Oh my~
<Vivix|Stuff> Remember that when you download simpsons, Simpsons costs 750 000 dollars for each episode, and is the life and bread of families
<twilight_sprinkle> Will is immortal, gets a free ship
<Ryunosuke> oh mai
<alexxm> i'd buy that for a dollar
<RustyMeat> mica
<Captain_Striker> dem legs
<CriticKitten> No I'm being honest now, why can't she come?
<flutterfan> O MY
<Ninja-Fou_Lou> FirstMateMaidkim: not really. Its a dictature. if you cut of the dictator youll end up most of the time destroying the whole thing. Opressed Empire citizent would start to rebell.
<ThePoniFromTortuga> Totally for kids
<Sinestro> someones got a foot fetish
<Barbetos> Shut up will
<Crimson_Phoenix> RustyMeat, Sumica isn't streaming :P
<Barbetos> DOn't ruin it
<Bronysith> AND THEN nothing sexual happened
<CaptainGanjalf> She came buffers
<Barbetos> GET IT ON!
<Malmortius> RIGHT IN THE INNOCENCE
<Godking_Buytoast> eat dem feet
<RustyMeat> dammitt
<Captain_Michael> you know, disney
<diddutz> Malmortius: not quite, but you have to find his heart and stab it just like they did for Davy jones
<Commodore_Dark92Enig> whoaaaaaaaaaaaa.........
<Barbetos> WHILE SHE IS STILL HOT!!
<Godking_Buytoast> das rtight
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Yeah. There is the difference that respectable internet pirates don't kill or anything.
<CriticKitten> There's no good reason given for why she can't just join his crew.
<Commodore_Dark92Enig> EAT THEM
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: but he has to ferry the dead for 10 years before he can see his wife and child
<FirstMaid_Cratorkid> disney everybody
<Godking_Buytoast> eat em up like butta on bread
<FirstMateMaidkim> Ninja-Fou_Lou: Except it wasn't a dictatorship. The emperor didn't control everything; he just had rights to interfere whenever he chose.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: i think you have to be undead for that, maybe she wants to be alive
<Barbetos> Hey baby. Keep my creepy heart
<Navigator_Vordox> I'm rating this movie 1 hour and 20 minutes of fine/20 minutes of full time buffer when climaxing out of Mips.
<Barbetos> Okay?
<RaveSwabbie> Aww <3
<RAWRity> Captain_Maid_Discord: they compensate for the lack of murder with intense entitlement issues.
<Commodore_Dark92Enig> D'aaaaaaaaaw
<Malmortius> Will, thats not as romanic as you'd think.
<alexxm> heres my heart
<Darf14> now hes going to try a long distance relationship
<crazypony> daaawwww
<FirstMateMaidkim> Ninja-Fou_Lou: Direct other complaints towards CriticKitten; he can explain better.
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Put it back in your chest, will.
<LilB> and keep it away from the kids... thy will be weirded out
<Sinestro> the Empire factured but yet they regained control when they finally chose a new Emperor
<Navigator_magmablock> :$
<Barbetos> Whatever. You know part of her was like "Box with a beating heart in it. GROSS!!"
<Sharakan> inb4 she sells it on ebay
<Vivix|Stuff> Captain_Maid_Discord: true- like downloading a brand new companie's game is not as "ok" as downloading.. Harmony 10 or Photoshop Pro
<CommodoreJoe11> dat is so romantic. in a gross kind of way
<Godking_Buytoast> within two years, she forgot about her willie and decided to marry a strong douchbag named Rudolph
<Malmortius> The fuck was that point in that?
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01RAWRity: Some do.
<twilight_sprinkle> it would be nicer if he had a tentacle face
<Sinestro> because the retarded audiance would eat this shit up
<Petrified_Pirate> Commodore_Dark92Enig: It's like Van Gogh to the extreme
<Malmortius> WILL, WHAT DO YOUR PIRATE EYES SEE?
<Captain_Striker> So beautiful :')
<Narolas> Eh, i admit this ending sucks ass, i completely forgot it was so bad and so filled with plot-holes
<Sharakan> why doesnt she just go with him?
<Sharakan> he cant stay on land but she can go to sea...
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> :'(
<Ninja-Fou_Lou> so is she undead now too?
*Captain_Striker kills Sharakan
<ChartmanFan> DAMNIT CAPTIAN, THE STREAM NEEDS LESS BUFFERS
<Darf14> nope
<Barbetos> wtf
<PinkiePieYoshi64> meanwhile: Back in Ponyville...
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Not many are a fan of pirates out to steal.
<sonicandmario85> anyone here play blockland?
<CommodoreJoe11> Malmortius: The Elf eyes meme is not that bad actually.
<RaveSwabbie> LOL
<sub06905> lol
*Meanwhile at port...
<Navigator_Vordox> Wrek: You gotta check up dat streaming stuff.
<RaveSwabbie> That dingy
<Ryunosuke> lol
<FirstMateMaidkim> They're disappointed by the size of his...ship.
<Kandarihu|MaidsMop> Come to think of it, the Emperor's death meaning the end of the empire, it makes sense. The Galactic Empire was a Galactic Republic before Palpatine dissolved the Senate, and it probably became a Galactic Republic again after Palpatine died.
<CaptainGanjalf> And... gone
<CabinBoy_Sid> lol
<ChartmanFan> FFFFFFFFFF-
<Darf14> lol
<Darf14> Here we go again
<FirstMateMaidkim> Kandarihu|MaidsMop: Not quite...expanded universe explains it better.
<Commodore_Dark92Enig> I can't see a thing thanks to the buffer............something about foot fetish, a treasure chest........WHAT?
<RaveSwabbie> that joke :D
<CaptainGanjalf> Why is the ru-ship gone?
<Meanwhile> Dat drunk.
<alexxm> and the film ends on another betrayal
<CriticKitten> They want to take a "ride"/
<RaveSwabbie> Bear!
<RustyMeat> dat teddy bear
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu|MaidsMop: they fight against the empire continued in the books, i dont know if it became a republic immediately
<ThePoniFromTortuga> I bet it is bigger up close
<CabinBoy_Sid> dar Bear
<CriticKitten> On his "ship"
<Captain_Michael> lol
<Crimson_Phoenix> You don't say
<RaveSwabbie> You dont say!
<ChartmanFan> NOOOOOOO
<Sinestro> Palpatine intended to live forever, he didnt expect to have it surivive without him
<Kandarihu|MaidsMop> FirstMateMaidkim, darn the Expanded Universe, then. But okay
<Darf14> Fail
<alexxm> you don't say
<AdmiralSaxy> 0,14wench fight!

<CaptainGanjalf> Honest Jack is honest
<CaptainGanjalf> Savvy?
<RAWRity> and then, they went on to make a 4th movie that nobody gave a shit about.
<CabinBoy_Sid> Triple slap
<RaveSwabbie> He likes it
<Meanwhile> Brofist.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> *slap*
<FillyFlam> Dem pirates
<FillyFlam> Also hi.
<Barbetos> Such a romantic notion.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: I actually like the fourth.
<ChartmanFan> RAWRity, and an AWESOME LEGO GAME
<AdmiralSaxy> 0,14BROFIST
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Pirate Brofist
<CaptainGanjalf> BROFIST
*Captain_Striker slaps everyone
<Darf14> sea turtles
<Navigator_magmablock> dat pickup line
<Commodore_Dark92Enig> Didn't see much of the movie, therefore i don't deserve being your Captain nor your Commodore............
<FirstMateMaidkim> Brofist, and then proceeds to steal his girls.
<ThePoniFromTortuga> Sea turtles
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> darn lagskip
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: It's better than this one, really.
<Kandarihu|MaidsMop> /3
<Petrified_Pirate> Navigator_magmablock: Never fails
<RaveSwabbie> Peanut!
<Darf14> *writes down pickup line*
<DocSane> The fourth was fun because it was originally a good novel that had nothing to do with PotC.
<Quick_Thinker> what do they know of sea ponies?
<Meanwhile> Again.
*Captain_Michael slaps Captain_Striker
<alexxm> he loves that monkey doesn't he
<Navigator_Vordox> LAWL
<Navigator_Vordox> THOSE TWO IN THE BACK

<ChartmanFan> I HATE monkeys
<Navigator_Vordox> It's the 2 FUNNY GUS!
<Commodore_Dark92Enig> RAWrity I actually liked the fourth one, though it wasn't as good as the 1st one
*Captain_Striker kills Captain_Michael
<Meanwhile> Fail.
<otakon> Okay once again I ask
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Plus, the fourth movie turns Barbossa into a BADASS
<RaveSwabbie> Omfg :D
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I'll admit, its writing was better, but I just honestly could not care about any of the characters. Their stories were DONE, and the 4th did nothing to flesh them out.
<sub06905> lol
*Captain_Michael is immortal
<Barbetos> Jack has it
<alexxm> gone
<CabinBoy_Sid> lol
<otakon> Is the lag insufferable for anyone else?

<CabinBoy_Sid> Suspended/10
<Navigator_magmablock> 9.5/10. Some of the plot is confusing (like the double-reverse-quadruplecross in the middle), but the awesome setpieces, action, and Jack make it all worthwhile

<CriticKitten> o.O
<FirstMateMaidkim> And, finally: Crabs/10
<Darf14> oh no, sorry im not him Vivix|Stuff
<RAWRity> 4/10. good action and very creative visually, but the writing is cluttered and overlycomplicated, with subplots that go nowhere and so many characters that it lacks focus. It's entertaining, but seriously in need of a rewrite.
<Barbetos> Funnier thing is that I am not drinking it!
<Vivix|Stuff> Aww, Oh well
<CaptainGanjalf> Backstab/10

<CaptainGanjalf> and CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow/10
<CriticKitten> I'd say it's higher than that, RAWRity, but I tend to be overly generous when assigning numbers, so I avoid doing so.

<Barbetos> Night Ninja-Fou_Lou
<twilight_sprinkle> LilB: *that is
<Spectrum_Indy> ok ready for the next
<LilB> good night Ninja-Fou_Lou ;)
<Vivix|Stuff> RAWRity: That sounds about right, you should be a producer
*Indiana_Striker uses whip on Captain_Michael
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: fair enough. it's still an entertaining film, no doubt. But it has a lot of writing issues that stuck out to me.
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> crap. I need something to watch for the next 22 minutes.
<FirstMateMaidkim> Right to assign ridiculous and uninformative scores to movie streams...suspended.

<RAWRity> Shizuka: I'm okay with that.
<CriticKitten> Butbutbut Shizu ;_;
<LilB> twilight_sprinkle according to pay pal the last time I paid 10$ it was 7.8€ i think its always around 8

<CriticKitten> The fourth is actually pretty good. :(
<twilight_sprinkle> diddutz: wow euro has dropped, last i remember it was about .6
<Kandarihu|MaidsMop> FirstMateMaidkim, we could use some closure on this.
<Squallken> Last Crusade > Raiders
<FirstMate_JESmith67> There. Been wanting to post the song
<Meanwhile> I'll stab whoever claims the fourth pirates movie is worth watching.
<ThePoniFromTortuga> Shizuka: A little late for that suspention
<HellsFortune> what did i miss ? ;o
<Sinestro> this would be my first time watching raiders so i'm hoping for a no lag
<FirstMateMaidkim> Meanwhile: I think you've already got a lot of targets here.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: It's worth watching.
*ThePoniFromTortuga has never seen the fourth movie
<Darf14> Time for the Last Crusade...... after the intermission
<Agrold> the fourth is alot better then the 3rd. Think this movie was the weakest of the pirate movies
*Meanwhile stabs CriticKitten.
<pony_6049> Actually, I found the 4th... okay :S
<Navigator_magmablock> Am I correct in assuming tomorrow will be Stranger Tides and Crystal Skull?
<CriticKitten> Eh, it's just a flesh wound.
<Shizuka> 13Navigator_magmablock: nope
<Meanwhile> Aye that be true.
<ThePoniFromTortuga> The right for Meanwhile to stab, expelled
<Shizuka> 13though i might show indy 4 with rifftrax
<Navigator_magmablock> aight
<pony_6049> I thought the 3rd one was tolerable and fun, but the 4th.... eh :S
<twilight_sprinkle> 4th pirates one was so boring
<CriticKitten> Besides, Barbossa is a badass in the fourth movie. That instantly makes it enjoyable to some degree.
<FirstMate_JESmith67> I was just about to say that Shizuka
<Meanwhile> The right to suspend me, suspended.
<FirstMateMaidkim> CriticKitten: I haven't seen it either, so...nominated for A!
*Shizuka 13hangs meanwhile from his pants
<Vivix|Stuff> What about the right to stay suspended by a rope?
<Shizuka> 13meanwhile, suspended
*Meanwhile blinks.
<twilight_sprinkle> FirstMateMaidkim: noo dont nominate it D:
<ThePoniFromTortuga> Shizuka: I just expelled him
<Meanwhile> This'd hurt more if it was the first time this has happened.
<Darf14> 4th pirates? ....... oh you mean the movie that helps me go to sleep
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Did you remember to put him in suspenders before suspending him?
<FirstMateMaidkim> SHIZU :D
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/NpVeA.jpg
<Indiana92Jones> I......didn't see much of this movie......therefore, i don't deserve being called Captain or Commodore, for that matter.................all because of dinner, house chores and lagging
<Basenji> I think any movie with johnny depp is worth watching personally...
<Shizuka> 13riven huts
<Shizuka> 13suspended
<FirstMate_JESmith67> Right to wear suspenders, suspended. Drop yer pants whoever's wearin' em
<FirstMate_JESmith67> Them big block of names in the credits

<Indiana92Jones> Ha, Shizu didn't suspend ME!! :D
<Meanwhile> Because really, it's not likely to live.
*Helmsmaid_Tovler cries knowing he'll never win the lottery.
<Darf14> Im still stunned that it takes so many people to make a movie

<Agrold> right to win the lottery, suspended.
<Kandarihu|MaidsMop> InB4 stinger
<ChartmanFan> GMail's acting wierd, so none of my votes are likely to get in anymore
<Vivix|Stuff> It would be less people if they spend more time, but that would cost more
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dang, I just went to go get a bowl of Ice cream and the credits are still on?!?!?
<Zamer> >logs into bronystate watches the best part of the movie
<FirstMateMaidkim> Meanwhile: Right to be pessimistic, suspended.
<CriticKitten> FirstMateMaidkim: You haven't? Oh you really should. It's admittedly got its flaws, but it makes up for a lot of them with a generally enjoyable scene. And there's no Kiera trying to act at us by screaming at the camera.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: been meaning to ask, any opinion on them splitting the Hobbit into 3 films?
<Kandarihu|MaidsMop> Agrold, only suspended for the mods
<sub06905> Right to make fifth pirate movie....
<twilight_sprinkle> Darf14: cgi is pretty hard
<Meanwhile> FirstMateMaidkim: Ye' canna' do that!
<Indiana92Jones> Right of being captain.........suspended
<Zamer> oh guys Saturday is my B-Day ^_^
<Cypresswolf> has the lotto page been sent this week?
*Indiana_Striker throws random object at someone
<Zamer> lotto page?
<Vivix|Stuff> not just CGI, but crew- gaffing- lines, makeup, set, maintenance- it adds up pretty fast
*Meanwhile in the future.
<Cypresswolf> lotto vote page
<Obsidian> Stinger time
<LilB> and thus she didn't age in 10 years :/
<alexxm> the future
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: On the one paw, I trust Jackson to know what he's doing. On the other, it feels like they're juicing it. I could see two very long movies, but not three very long movies.
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> But mods have the occassion Mod pick week. They must be allowed to enter the lottery.
<Barbetos> She does not look a day older
<cowvarkian> pirates OF THE FUTURE
<Indiana92Jones> OH HAI SEQUEL BAIT
<Barbetos> Its like the 10 years never happened!
<FirstMate_JESmith67> Yeah I was about to ask about the survey. I haven't gotten by email yet. Have they even been sent out yet?
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Wait.
<Quick_Thinker> huh i guess this the treat people get for staying
<Agrold> 10 years later.. doesn't look a day older..
<CriticKitten> Hey look, it's Anakin.
<Indiana92Jones> I SERIOUSLY NEED TO SEE THIS FULL MOVIE!!!!!!!!!
<Barbetos> Come on movie
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01When did they procreate?
<Barbetos> its called make up
<FirstMateMaidkim> CriticKitten: I was hoping the Hobbit would be one movie. One of the reasons I love the Hobbit above the original series is, well, my ability to finish it.
<Darf14> It should have ended like this
<Spectrum_Indy> yay
<cowvarkian> when didnt they Captain_Maid_Discord
<Barbetos> Oh!
<Barbetos> I know!
<twilight_sprinkle> Cypresswolf: i havent gotten anything, hopefully im still subscribed at all
<Meanwhile> Ten years. Damn.
<FirstMateMaidkim> Captain_Maid_Discord: Their spirits mated when they were fighting together. CLEARLY.
<Barbetos> She went to the fountain of youth too!
<Squallken> That............suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks :[
<cowvarkian> which doesnt really answer your question
<Darf14> Daddys Home! Time to teach you how to plunder villages :)
<Barbetos> lol
<Vivix|Stuff> The only part in LoTR I skipped was that elf place, read like a meeting report. I did not skip anything in FoE..
<Squallken> 10 years
<Obsidian> And we never see them again
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: from what I've heard, the stuff that they're gonna be using for padding will be all the stuff Gandalf and Ratagast were doing to fight Sauron whie Bilbo was fucking around with the Dwarves.
<prince-dari> >10 years
<Sinestro> and then Nellson Navy killed them all
<CriticKitten> FirstMateMaidkim: I expected two movies, though. I figured it unlikely they'd fit that book neatly into one movie. But three seems to be stretching it fiercely.
<prince-dari> >get back to wife
<Godking_Buytoast> damn looks like it's asspirates of the carribean now
<prince-dari> >have a child
<prince-dari> >no sex
<ThePoniFromTortuga> Did anyone get the newletter yet
<prince-dari> Sad times
<FirstMateMaidkim> CriticKitten: Behold the power of moneys.
<Franek12354> intermission.
*CaptainGanjalf hoists the colours and sails away

<Barbetos> Kay. Gona play some more skyrim!
<Zamer> ooh monty python
<Navigator_Vordox> Wrek: Check that mips out :P
<Darf14> welp, brb in 19:43
<cowvarkian> seems legit diddutz
<alexxm> ThePoniFromTortuga nope
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: so hey, that means more Ian McKellan, Sylvester McCoy, and Benedict Cumberbatch. I ain't gonna complain.
<ThePoniFromTortuga> alexxm: Huh.
<Kandarihu|MaidsMop> Helmsmaid_Tovler, maybe having more mod pick weeks would be nice, in exchange for them not entering the lottery. The lottery is where the viewers get to vote on movies.
<Quick_Thinker> intermission well time to check Fim Fic for reviews on my story
<cowvarkian> Ill see anything with benedict cumberbatch
<FlaschenJoe11> gonna head to bed now. Seeyah all next night,
<ObsidianGrail> Night FlaschenJoe11
<Meanwhile> Und on that note, I need some chocolate.
<twilight_sprinkle> bye FlaschenJoe11
<Indiana_Striker> I`m going to make scrambled eggs
<ThePoniFromTortuga> Intermission time, gonna do stuff brb
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> brb, gonna take a leak
<PinkiePieYoshi64> By the Bay <3 <3 <3
<cowvarkian> benedict cumberbatch = most british name ever
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I'm gonna play Sim City, now thank you. :P
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: I don't want to complain, but I admit I have to worry about them running out of things to do and the movie being dragged down by slow pacing.
<cowvarkian> well, just add a few titles, and then it is...
<Indiana92Jones> This needs more views on YouTube.......and more railings <-------
<Quick_Thinker> does anyone else think that cadence is chewing gum? look at her jaw it kinda of looks like shes chewing on gum
<cowvarkian> and more pylons Indiana92Jones
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I still say they should make a Tom Bombadil movie
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> Kandarihu|MaidsMop: That was one of my feigned-ignorance thingy's in reference to the 2 times Mods had a mod-pick even, although Prince_dari hasn't had a movie yet.
<sub06905> TALLY HO!
<Vivix|Stuff> Tom Bombadil was crazy, msised that part in the movie-
<Indiana_Striker> I SAY!!
<cowvarkian> oh yeah, tom bombadil
<Vivix|Stuff> I wonder what the hell he was, the way he handled the ring?
*LilB is away during Intermission
<Lil_B> name fixed XD
<RAWRity> Vivix|Stuff: Bombadil's either God, Tolkein's stand-in, or some combination of the two.
<Vivix|Stuff> yees- Tolkiens OC, if you will
<PinkiePieYoshi64> and... cue the electric guitar :P
<Kandarihu|MaidsMop> I remember that Mod pick week. They crammed so many movies in together, that it started to happen during times when I couldn't watch.
<sub06905> BEES!
<pony_6049> >..>
<pony_6049> >.>*
<cowvarkian> OH GOD NOT THE BEEEES
<FirstMateMaidkim> Magic, sillies.
<pony_6049> lol
<cowvarkian> and ill brb
<RAWRity> I remember Mod Pick weekend. Everyone got pissed because they couldn't understand Black Rock Shooter
*Vivix|Stuff can't remember mod pick weekend
<CriticKitten> Love this intermission. XD
<Franek12354> What is freindship
<Vivix|Stuff> that's what I get for tkaing month long breaks from this place
<FirstMateMaidkim> RAWRity: Oi, I've heard of that anime. Isn't it supposed to be incomprehensible or somesuch?
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> Was it Black Rock Shooter the OVA or 8 episode anime?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Derpy's on line two?!?! But it's buffering :O
<RAWRity> Helmsmaid_Tovler: OVA
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Stream still bumpy for everyone?
<Eulshy> meow
<pony_6049> Just a little, but it was only a few seconds ago
<FirstMateMaidkim> Captain_Maid_Discord: That's all right, I'm okay with this buffer :>
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: When in doubt, it's always a big ol' metaphor.
<RAWRity> FirstMateMaidkim: nah, it's perfectly comprehensible, just not straight-forward enough for some folks here.
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> BRS the anime is amazing. I found the OVA kinda boring
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: wasn't even that. People he got confused by non-inear storytelling.
<FirstMateMaidkim> RAWRity: Well, you'll get some like that in any crowd. Think I'll go take a look at it now.
<ObsidianGrail> Captain_Maid_Discord: Its good for now
<SaxyPretender> 0,14took a while to get the hang of it, but the BRS OVA was pretty good
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Gondor is... dead... :O
<Vivix|Stuff> Rememeber that if someone screams "WHAT THE FUCK" people will join for the comraderie, somehow
<Vivix|Stuff> That's why people hate Twilight sooo muuuch
<RAWRity> To be fair, I hate twilight because I actually read all 4 books. I have a basis for my hate, and actual experience to back it up.
<Vivix|Stuff> True
<Vivix|Stuff> I only saw the movies and went.. not horrible, not good
<Navigator_magmablock> :);):D:P:$:O:|:S:[6_9:);):D:P:$:O:|:S:[6_9:);):D:P:$:O:|:S:[6_9:);):D:P:$:O:|:S:[6_9
<Applechip> Hey, just got in here, what's up next?
<Eulshy> I hate Twilight cause have you read it?
<pony_6049> Hey spammer >.>
<Zamer> I don't hate Twilight, I just hate what they did to Vampires
<Eulshy> Dem spam
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Oh right, I remember now. That thing that started at the end.
<Vivix|Stuff> I don't hate that either- Dracula is more lame
<Vivix|Stuff> but..dracula is FUNNY at least
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: And then ran multiple things concurrently.
<Vivix|Stuff> "BLEEHH!"
<cowvarkian> I like mel brooks dracula...
<sub06905> dat spidey
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> I try to watch things before jumping on the hate bandwagon.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> LOL at theintermission
<Zamer> well dracula was also back in the black n white silent movies era
<Vivix|Stuff> It's funny- but you know, serious vampire? I have no idea where to go, because all the serious ones are so weird
<WalkerPony89> Hiyo bronystate!
<Vivix|Stuff> Wasn't.. BLADE a vampire movie?
<Zamer> yes
<cowvarkian> wouldnt it be thee?
<Eulshy> I'm eating potato chips with mustard on them
<Zamer> he's a daywalker
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: more or less. It ended at the middle, and the two plots we saw going on were the 2 halves of the plot spliced together. Sort of like the perpindicular answer to Memento
<cowvarkian> meh
<Vivix|Stuff> I just... I didn't like that movie
<Vivix|Stuff> as a kid that is, never seen it since
<Sumica> 00,10Ok so short anouncment
<Sumica> 00,10Many of you have already asked but this week there was no survay or news letter sent out
<Sumica> 00,10It comes partly from not having much time to get people set up in order to make one in time.
<Sumica> 00,10as many of you may know Kirz left and he handled the newsletter.
<Meanwhile> Man who's managing mod duties?
<Sumica> 00,10That being said there is not much need for panice because we were not having a normal movie night next week any ways
<Reikim> Oh, so that's why there was no newsletter.
<RaveSwabbie> Apparently :o
<Sumica> 00,10Next friday-sunday we are showing lord of the rings extended cut.
<Reikim> Isn't...Ghosties in charge, or something?
<Sumica> 00,10One movie per day.
<Reikim> Or is it like a collective thing?
<Reikim> Oh lord
<RaveSwabbie> I think its collective :P
<Reikim> So that's why there's no movie lottery
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when WHERE WAS GONDOR was coming back next week?~
<pony_501018> Where was Gondor when there isn't movie night next week and LotR movies shown, thus spawning Gondor jokes?
<Ryunosuke> :(
<RAWRity> The whole "Twilight ruined vampires" thing is kind of shallow. A reason to hate Twilight would be the rampant mysogyny, its trivialization of rape, abortion, and numerous other issues. Its glorification of unhealthy romance and relationships. The sub-par, grammatically abhorent writing. The constant, obvious foreshadowing that spoiled its own plot twists. Inconsistent rules within its own universe. Cheap cop outs to keep charact
<Ryunosuke> kirz left
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> I wish I could pick The Secret of Kells for B Movie, but its too gorgeous and I'd hate to see it ruined with Lag/Low resolution.
<Meanwhile> Dat wall of text.
<CriticKitten> YESSSSSSSS.
<JESmith71> Wait Sumi, no normal movie night means no pony episodes next week?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Lord of the Rings? sweet :D :D :D
<Reikim> RAWRity: ...Impressive.
<pony_501018> Meanwhile: I beat you agaaaaaaaaaaaaaaain~
<Reikim> Extended cut. That's...three hours per movie, I think.
<Sumica> 00,10might slip in some pony eps ^_^
<Vivix|Stuff> RAWRity true, it wasn't a good book, but the community hate was spawned by popularity of the hate, not the poor state of hte book
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> We had a pony lottery last time LoTR night was done.
<Meanwhile> pony_501018: First off, who are you. And on my screen, no you didn't. :P
<Sumica> 00,10seeing as i will probably be the one streaming them
<Vivix|Stuff> The are many equally shitty books out there
<RAWRity> stuff that's actually a judgment of quality, not "omg they made vampires wooses!" Vampire knight did that shit years beforehand.
<otakon> Sumica: hell yeah ponies!
<Meanwhile> Yup.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Gondor's right there, silly.
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Yes, I did just take over stream.
<Meanwhile> Last time it was glorious.
<PillowPoni> Meanwhile: And Yes I did beat you. It shows me first on my screen
<otakon> AR! MUTINY BY Captain_Maid_Discord
<Meanwhile> And this time it will be additionally glorious.
<Reikim> How so?
<DocSane> I've never read a Twilight novel, but I attempted to watch one of the movies.
<Godking_Buytoast> let your Godking take it over
<Vivix|Stuff> Thank's for the Announcment Sumica
<Godking_Buytoast> i have power
<DerpyWhooves> xD
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Bloodrayne?
<sub06905> well im off bye everypony :)
<pony_6049> Must be difficult at times to stream and entertain, so we appreciate everything you guys are doing
<WalkerPony89> See ya sub06905
<DocSane> For a film supposedly involving vampires and werewolves, it was deadly dull.
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> At least the Vampire Knight fad die… was it ever a fad?
<Meanwhile> PillowPoni: Clearly we need a third party to confirm who was /actually/ first.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Can't forget Bloodrayne. :P
<Reikim> RAWRity: Erk, that anime...what I hear about it is not good.
<cowvarkian> cant we? CriticKitten
<SaxyPretender> 0,14More people
<PillowPoni> Meanwhile: So be it *shakes your hand*
<Reikim> No, I mean, glorious how?
<RaveSwabbie> Damn, my firefox just up and died
<Applechip> I just got in here, anypony know whats up next?
<Meanwhile> Because it'll be like a "look how far we have come" moment.
<Vivix|Stuff> My point with Twilight as an example is that people tend to latch on to popular opinion more if they are negative
<Reikim> Helmsmaid_Tovler: I still know people obssessed with it. It disturbs me.
<Meanwhile> Besides, LotR is great.
<CriticKitten> Vampire Knight eh? Next time I get bored I think I'll take a looksee.
<RaveSwabbie> What else did Sumi say??
<Kandarihu> So, will the LotR trilogy be this upcoming weekend or the next one?
<RAWRity> Reikim: it's a shlocky pile of poo. Basically it's the female answer to High School of the Dead.
<ObsidianGrail> Kandarihu: This week
<RaveSwabbie> After "1 movie every day"
<Kandarihu> Ooohkay.
<Sumica> 00,10it might just kill me to do it but we have one more thing next week.
<Navigator_Vordox> Phase4: You're good with Java?
<Reikim> Maybe some pony eps slipped in, because he'll be streaming.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: not really worth it. It's more boring than anything. Uness you're into barely concealed homoeroticism.
<Sumica> 00,10JACKIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, ONE MORE THING!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<Meanwhile> Sumica is best uncle.

<Meanwhile> Oh my god.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Drat. Had hoped for something at least mildly entertaining in its suckiness.
<Tovler> Hm, It might be my 1 year Anniversary since I settled on the name Tovler.
<ObsidianGrail> wat
<Vivix|Stuff> That's a crazy idea
<RaveSwabbie> Hmm.
<Shooeie> Are we watching Jackie Chan adventures?
<LordMoistBeckett> !
<PillowPoni> Sumica: *le gasp* YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<Reikim> RAWRity: So, basically, the majority of anime geared to teenage girls.
<Applechip> oh god... could you image uncle in equestria?
<pony_6049> O________O All eight?!!?!? You're crazy lol
<Meanwhile> All 8. Jesus.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> all harry pothead movies ?

<Spectrum_Indy> Sumica: you mad
<Meanwhile> Inb4 people get sick after Azkaban.
<Vivix|Stuff> hehe
<Navigator_Vordox> We're going to watch Radcliffe grow
<Tovler> Bad day Bad day Bad day!
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: you want entertaining suckiness? Fushyugi Yuugi. It's like if Inuyasha was entertaining and somehow had a worse dub.
<Phase4> 00,02Navigator_Vordox, not particuarly but i can work with it, why?
<CriticKitten> Next week?
<Vivix|Stuff> noo- after Azkaban the movies get really ood
*PillowPoni has exploded into a pile of happiness
<RaveSwabbie> Wow
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01I don't think I can watch them all. My family is getting pissy (as always) about me being here so much.
<Meanwhile> All 8. Holy shit. I haven't even seen all 8.
<DerpyWhooves> Twilight is best pony. *name is DerpyWhooves*
<Kandarihu> I hope these won't have running times in excess of 2 hours, right?
<Tovler> Next week is Harry Potter week?
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Butbut, Sesshoumaru. :(
<RaveSwabbie> :o
<Navigator_Vordox> Phase4: I need help with designing a beat signal system based on 2 vectors that pulses to the time of beats in a song
<Navigator_Vordox> :P
<SaxyPretender> 0,14next week is Harry Potter week, and then LOTR
<Reikim> I had some issues with the last one.
*Reikim shrugs
<Sumica> 00,10yes SaxyPretender
<Meanwhile> I read them all, but I've not really seen them.
<Navigator_Vordox> With controlling variables based on current frames of animation within SWF
<Vivix|Stuff> You're programing a bpm animation?
<RaveSwabbie> Well, ive never seen LotR, so that'll be fun.
<WalkerPony89> Aww. I'd rather watch LoTR
<Reikim> Ah, yeah, I read them too.
<Midnight_Fyre> Nuts., I'm going to be at work all next week
<doobinz> Morning
<Tovler> He's bring Sesshy back
<Meanwhile> Bloody hell.
<Meanwhile> Next week is going to be mind melting.
<Phase4> 00,02Navigator_Vordox, wat?
<CriticKitten> So basically, next week is going to be pretty much lethal in terms of overall movie time
<Tovler> Wizard!
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01If I have children, and they want to spend time on the computer, I'm going to let them as long as they're being productive.
<JESmith71> Sumi, for the LotR stuff, what will the show times on Saturday and Sunday be? Will you play it on Saturday during normal Euro night time or move it to 7 EST?
<Navigator_Vordox> Phase4: Pretty much that feel myself :P
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: fuck seshhoumaru. We've got a transvestite that throws giant rocks and kills monsters.
<CriticKitten> That is so wizard.
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Reikim> The last HP movie had some pacing issues, in my opinion.
*CriticKitten is bringing it back.
<Spectrum_Indy> Und dann Meanwhile was Ron
<Kandarihu> So this upcoming weekend will be the regular BMN/EMN, and the weekend after THAT will be LotR?
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01RAWRity: Wut?
<GabeMoist> Captain_Maid_Discord, productive like we're being right now?
<Tovler> Suikotsu?
<cowvarkian> is that really a phrase, CriticKitten
<RAWRity> Captain_Maid_Discord: taking bout Fushyugi Yuugi
<Bronysith> RAWRity: we talking about inuyasha?
<Sumica> 00,10friday will be normal time for friday, sat and sunday will be euro time
<DerpyWhooves> does anyone remember derpy.in
<RaveBrony> I never read the last 2 books :(
<CriticKitten> cowvarkian: Weren't here when Star Wars Robot Chicken was streamed?
<Tovler> I forget the named of the band of seven
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01RAWRity: Never heard of him.
<Reikim> Quick check: I'm not capable of spoiling Harry Potter for anyone here oh darn
<Meanwhile> Sumica: That for LotR?
<Tovler> *names*
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01I work to entertain you and make you happy.
<RAWRity> Captain_Maid_Discord: it's an anime. It's like if Inyasha were so bad its good instead of so bad it's boring as fuck.
<cowvarkian> I might have been, CriticKitten
<cowvarkian> I was probably asleep
<pony_6049> Uh... what? :S
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01I actually like Inyuyasha.
<Reikim> RAWRity: Oh, I've heard of that. Tried to read it. Got bored.
<WalkerPony89> CriticKitten: When was Star Wars Robot Chicken streamed?!
<Kandarihu> This is going to cause problems. I was planning to show my mom Macross II next week. Monday through Saturday
<Bronysith> RAWRity: you didnt care for inuyasha did you?
<RAWRity> Bronysith: I did not.
<Kandarihu> Captain_Maid_Discord, I also enjoyed Inuyasha.
<CriticKitten> cowvarkian: In the prequels, Anakin and friends say "that's so wizard". In Robot Chicken, they make a Return of the Jedi joke in which Vader claims he's going to "bring wizard back".
<cowvarkian> oh yeah, I remember that
<CriticKitten> Ergo, I'm bringing it back.
<Reikim> Well
<Reikim> Do you mind?
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Inyuyasha was one of the animes that got me into anime. I hated anime before.
<Bronysith> RAWRity: well i can understand that, not everyones cup of tea. but i liked it lol
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I remember a time when I tried to bring a word back
*RaveBrony 's fav anime is Inuyasha :$
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: so what you're saying is, you're George Lucas
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Besides the music, anyone else with headphones have static along with the sound output?
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01I thought it was all DBZ.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...it didn't go so well
<Bronysith> Captain_Maid_Discord: i like inuyasha, kewl story
<cowvarkian> But I saw them on adult swim when they actually aired >.>
<CriticKitten> Discord: I actually liked Inuyasha too.
<DerpyWhooves> Isn't toot coming in a sec?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14except for one phrase people liked
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01When I found the adult stuff, I started liking anime.
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: Which word, pray tell?
<Zamer> Mobile Fighter G gundam was what got me since it was the first anime i recognized
<Ryunosuke> Tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot toooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot toooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot tooot :D

<CriticKitten> Discord: But I'll admit it's not great.
<DerpyWhooves> i knew it
<Kandarihu> The anime that got me into anime was Sailor Moon. TMK, the only anime I saw before that was Go Lion
<Spectrum_Indy> >_>
<Reikim> Anyway, Meanwhile
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the word was poontang, Reikim
<pony_6049> That spam! >.<
<WalkerPony89> Toot
<RaveBrony> I know im not going to read the books :D no more time on my hands
<Reikim> ...Weird.
<Tovler> I wish I knew who picked Speed Racer for A movie so I can hug him.
<Reikim> Anyway, Meanwhile
<cowvarkian> SaxyPretender: was it porch monkey?
*RAWRity hated Inuyasha a great deal.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I shal join the spam!: Toot.
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01And when I say adult, I mean stuff aimed at adults, not hentai.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: If I were George Lucas, I couldn't hate the prequels or Crystal Skull.
<Sumica> 00,10yes Meanwhile, that is for lotr
<SaxyPretender> 0,14no, but it begins with p
<Meanwhile> Eh? Wha?
<Reikim> You know the part just after the Death Eaters break through the Hogwarts shield?
<Tovler> Wasn't inuyasha for girls anyway?
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Thanks.
<JESmith71> So are the trilogy movie weeks wrapping up then? Is LotR going to be the finale to it?
<cowvarkian> Ill just say yes, Tovler
<Reikim> Basically after the main battle there
<RAWRity> Tovler: wasn't MLP for girls anyway?
<Franek12354> what film is next?
<Meanwhile> Ur...
<Bronysith> Sumica: next week is LOTR?
<RaveBrony> RAWRity: Lol! :D
<Meanwhile> When did the book come out?
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01I enjoyed Rozen Maiden, and that's supposedly for girls.
<CriticKitten> Inuyasha is considered by many to be "DBZ for girls", yes. :p
<Reikim> Dunno
<Reikim> Anyway
<WalkerPony89> RAWRity: Damn ninja >.<
<Ryunosuke> my first actual anime (not the americanized crap) was either Birdy the Mighty or APC Nuku Nuku (OVA)
<cowvarkian> Ill just say yes, RAWRity
<Reikim> The movie had pacing issues thereabouts
<Franek12354> best moments of itnermission
<Ryunosuke> I forget which ;p
<Meanwhile> Because that'll be the year I read it.
<RAWRity> I'd consider Inuyasha "Twilight for anime fans"
<Bronysith> Captain_Maid_Discord: wat did you think of ouran high school host club?
<RaveBrony> Never watched DBZ, and loved watching Inuyasha x_x
<Reikim> After the initial conflict, everything else kind of felt low-key.
<GabeMoist_> When I started anime, it was mostly stuff my brother was watching, like Slayers, Rozen Maiden, Trigun, and stuff like that
<Tovler> RAWRity: Gottem!
<alexxm> night guys
<Reikim> Like the battle should have been the climax.
<Zamer> i see a spear
<Vivix|Stuff> I never got into anime- despite being heavily into japanese 90s music
<CriticKitten> But I dun care. It introduced Sesshoumaru, who is a badass, albeit a poorly written one.
<Meanwhile> You'll have to point this out to me on Thursday.
<cowvarkian> is it being shined by an argonian maid? Zamer
<CriticKitten> I don't blame Auron for FFX though, do I? No sir.
<otakon> yAY BEST MOVIE INDIANA STYLE GO!
<RAWRity> so I think,, of all places, BRONYstate would not be the place where I have to explain why something being for a certain demographic is an excuse for it sucking.
<Reikim> I enjoyed Nanoha and Madoka, and those were supposedly aimed at girls.
<otakon> CriticKitten: um Auron was AWESOME
<ObsidianGrail> wat
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: he's a bad ass until you put a bee hive near him.
<pony_6049> Spoilers!
<WalkerPony89> Moar Indy?
<pony_6049> lol
<Zamer> indiana jones?
<pony_6049> 3rd one
<RaveBrony> Indy time!
<Reikim> If I'm here
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Alrighty! Skip through the movie into the action scenes!!!!!
<otakon> HELL YEAH BEST INDY MOVIE!
<Kandarihu> Reikim, both of those series are aimed at guys.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> :P
<CriticKitten> otakon: Exactly. Even a bad piece of content can produce a sweet character.
<Reikim> Probably won't be.
<cowvarkian> no, its gurren laggen
<Zamer> anyone else hearing static on the stream?
<MysteriousKaos> Indiana Jones my fellow bronies
<JESmith71> We join our movie already in progress
<Tovler> Nanoha, really?
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Inyuyasha didn't have fight scenes taking 5 episodes to finish or video-game like elements.
<Eulshy> AHAHahahahaHAHAHAhahahaAHAHahahaha
<MysteriousKaos> BEST INDIANA JONES MOVIE EVER!!!
<WalkerPony89> ^
<GabeMoist> Reikim, Nanoha I don't think was actually aimed at girls
<Reikim> Kandarihu: Lies and Slander! The first season of Nanoha, at least, wasn't aimed at guys.
<Kandarihu> A prodominantly female cast =/= a female target audience. That's like saying that Touhou is for girls.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile in the deserts of....somewheresville
<magmablock> Last Crusade is best Indy movie
<Squallken> evening everypony
<cowvarkian> but its an anime? isnt it? Captain_Maid_Discord
<otakon> CriticKitten: honestly the voice acting was 50/50 but I liked FFX except for the goddamn infuriating sidequest to get the ultimate weapons
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01It had a pretty good stor(ies)
<ObsidianGrail> Hello Squallken
<WalkerPony89> 'Ello Squallken
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat rock formation :O
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hello Squallken
<cowvarkian> dat arizona
<CriticKitten> This movie is such a gem.
<cowvarkian> or new mexico
*Eulshy Pours sugar over everypony
<CriticKitten> SEAN CONNERY YESSSSSS
<DaringDoFan> IT
<cowvarkian> or somewhere in the american mid west
<DaringDoFan> BEGINS
<cowvarkian> it all looks the same
<magmablock> Badash lishp
<Adventuer_Quick_Thin> new name go
<Squallken> I love this movie :D
<RAWRity> But seriously, if you think about it, Inuyasha is surprisingly similar to Twilight in regards to premise.
<Midnight_Fyre> Best Indiana Jones movie
<Meanwhile> Well, I'll watch it.
<cowvarkian> ill brb
<Reikim> Captain_Maid_Discord: The only issue I had with Inuyasha was length. My God, the length. It took too long for me, personally, to wrap up plot threads. Mainly the love triangle. Kikyoh x Inuyasha x Kagome got old for me after a while.
<Applechip> opinions on temple of doom?
<Ryunosuke> dismount!
<Vivix> Howrsies
<Reikim> You'll notice it.
<Meanwhile> We can discuss the pacing fail after I'm actually aware of said fail.
<CriticKitten> Reikim: The Final Act of Inuyasha is far more rapidly paced.
<ObsidianGrail> Flashback time
<Midnight_Fyre> Applechip: Great movie, but weakest of the trilogy
<Reikim> There's a massive battle with the Death Eaters, and then this...lull.
<Zamer> but kagome never wishes to become a hanyou
<otakon> Herman's horse sick?
<Kandarihu> Reikim, Nanoha was based on an H-Game series called Triangle Hearts, particularily a VERY action-based installment entitled Sweet Songs Forever. Lyrical Nanoha was based on an omake that was a LOT more cutesy than the Lyrical Nanoha we know EVER was.
<otakon> Zamer: yes the anime was suck
<RAWRity> Kagome = Bella. inuyasha= Edward, Koga=Jacob, Naraku=Volturi
<Fedora_Quick_Thinker> okay now new name go
<Ryunosuke> who here remembers the "Young Indiana Jones" series
<WalkerPony89> I've only heard of it, myself
<DaringDoFan> In the Lego Game the Caves with the Boy Scout was its own level
<Midnight_Fyre> Ryunosuke: I do
<Reikim> Kandarihu: I still maintained it was aimed at girls initially. Or, was supposed to be. Then, I think, the writers decided "fuck that" and had fun with it.
<Vivix> Mouth breathing fat kid!
<CriticKitten> The Boy Scouts of America. Taking your children into dark caverns to run into dangerous fugitives since 1093.
<CriticKitten> *1903.
<GabeMoist> Kandarihu, and then the spin off became more popular then the parent series
<Eulshy> RAWRity did you just compare inuyasha to twilight?
<DerpyWhooves> cupcakes
<RAWRity> Eulshy: I did.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> in wich one he gets nuked in a fridge ?
*Eulshy Hangs self
<Vordox> This scene reminds me of a Western Billy Crystal film...
<CriticKitten> ACTING.
<Ryunosuke> the cross of cortez
<Fedora_Quick_Thinker> the ankuh from Spelunky
*WalkerPony89 uses a defib to revive Eulshy
<Tovler> Rich I tells ya!
<Kandarihu> Considering that these are Japanese writers, deciding to have fun with it would typically mean the mood gets lighter.
<GabeMoist> Reikim, I don't think H-games are aimed at little girls
<otakon> dat Indy
<Godking_Buytoast> oh man, is this blazing saddles?
<Applechip> Midnight_Fyre: It was just too silly for me to get into it. Although i do like the scene where Indie slaps Short Round
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Vordox: City Slickers?
<Reikim> GabeMoist: But they can spawn shows aimed at them.
<otakon> damn 1912?
<Meanwhile> 4th.
<Ryunosuke> oh coronado
<Meanwhile> Aka the one that doesn't exist.
<Reikim> GabeMoist: Nanoha was only tangentially related.
*Midnight_Fyre just noticed Daring Do in the corner
<otakon> that was the year RDR took place
<RaveBrony> :o
*Bronysith licks Reikim s shins
<Lil_B> I like this movie, but I don't think I'll go thought it, good night everyone
<otakon> IT ALWAYS BELONGS IN A MUSEUM
<Bronysith> Reikim: how do you enjoy bioshock so far?
<RaveBrony> Only a snake :D
<WalkerPony89> It's only a snake...
<CriticKitten> Even as a kid, Indiana is a stuck up kid. xD
<Godking_Buytoast> oh, it's indian joe
<Ryunosuke> yes, he wasnt always afraid of snakes
<pony_6049> Young Indie, says only a snake. Oh boy lol
<Fedora_Quick_Thinker> everpony needs fedora in thier name
<Vivix> He was handsome as young
<Ryunosuke> wait
<DaringDoFan> YOINKK
<cowvarkian> wait, are we watching the young indiana part?
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01He didn't care about snakes then?
<CriticKitten> >I'll think of something
<Ryunosuke> its explained
<CriticKitten> >steals it
<Bronysith> otakon: no, it belongs to the poor, no it belongs to god, no, it belongs to everyone
<WalkerPony89> When did he become afraid of snakes?
<CriticKitten> >no escape plan
<Reikim> Bronysith: Sander Cohen is a sick, twisted ****. Pretty much my thoughts on it right now.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat fail :O
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat WIN :D
<Midnight_Fyre> Dat River Phoenix
<RAWRity> also, to the person who mentioned Madoka, I think Madoka was meant as a deconstruction of the whole Magical Girl show archetype, right?
<WalkerPony89> RUN INDY, RUN!
<DaringDoFan> That guy's named Fedora BTW
<ObsidianGrail> sneak fail
<Kandarihu> According to TV Tropes, Lyrical Nanoha takes the Magical Girl Warrior subgenre of Magical Girl and combines it with MECHA tropes. And there are shoutouts to Gundam and Gao Gai Gar in this.
<Bronysith> Reikim: whos sander cohen again?
<Spectrum_Indy> otakon: your statement http://i.imgur.com/aPvL6.jpg
<Applechip> good horse
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01It's a rare artifact. It belongs in my colon.
<RaveBrony> :D
<CriticKitten> lol
<Ryunosuke> troll
<Eulshy> ow
<RAWRity> "ow my shins"
<pony_6049> lol
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> Trollhorse
<DocSane> And his wonder horse, Celestia...
<Reikim> RAWRity: Pretty much. But it masquerades as a kids' show. All the official art and that. I pity any poor girl who picks up the series thinking it's another fluffy Magical Girl show.
<Fedora_Quick_Thinker> its a rare artifact it belongs in Spelunky
<otakon> Wait doesn't Indiana adopt the leather coat and fedora look IIRC?
<Bronysith> Reikim: but also, andrew ryan, whatcu think of andrew ryan?
<DaringDoFan> This must be Red Dead Redmption
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat troll horse... I bet it's Trixie...
<otakon> dammit chat froze brb
<CriticKitten> otakon: Watch. :3
<derpyface> HEY DUDES
<Reikim> Bronysith: Sander Cohen is the artist dude in Fort Frolic.
<otakon> yh chat is still frozen
<derpyface> B ROHOOF /)
<otakon> goddammit
<Fedora_Quick_Thinker> EVERYPONY PUT YOUR FEDORA ITS TIME FOR DARING DOOS
<Bronysith> Reikim: oh god, him
<RAWRity> hey, they stole this scene from the Last Roundup!
<otakon> brb
<Applechip> that's one fast horse
<WalkerPony89> DaringDoFan: If RDR had vechicles
<Tovler> I keep trying to watch Madoka, but the Hidamari Sketch art style subconsciously makes me look away from the show.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> never been a fan of indiana jones ._.
<Kandarihu> If you want to see what a Magical Girl series that's aimed at girls is like, look for the entries that don't have fighting in it. Ojamajo Doremi and the like, and ANY Magical Girl series that predates Sailor Moon.
<RAWRity> he abandoned his horse! The bastard!
<WalkerPony89> DaringDoFan: Wait it did, nevermind :P It had that one car
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> dem giraffes
<derpyface> SNAKES
<Ryunosuke> snakes
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Snakes on a TRAIN :O :O :O :O
<RaveBrony> D:
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> lol snakes
<flutterfan> NOPE
<pony_6049> Circus with snakes. Cool >.>
<WalkerPony89> Why did it have to be snakes...?
<Kandarihu> And THAT's how he learned to fear Snakes.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Wow
<HellsFortune> ew
<cowvarkian> no, its alligators on a train
<HellsFortune> x.x
<Vivix> eew
<derpyface> THAST NOT DISGUSTING AT ALL
<Reikim> Tovler: it gets really deep, and really depressing, really fast. Then...well, I won't spoil.
<Vordox> Smart kid :P
<RAWRity> well, that explains the fear of snakes.
<Ryunosuke> thats where he gained his fear of snakes
<diddutz_1> so that made him fear snakes ...
<derpyface> <3
<Eulshy> Bacstory
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> *that snake quote*
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01And now he hates snakes.
<RaveBrony> and thus, the fear started
<derpyface> HE THEN GET A SCAR FROM A LION AND A WHIP NUFF SAID
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Put the snake in the guy's face!
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> So that's where he got that phobia from
<Ryunosuke> uh oh
<CriticKitten> Oshit
<pony_6049> o.o
<Reikim> Promised myself I wouldn't watch this...promised that I'd finish my writing.........*sighs*
<JESmith71> Honestly I haven't been into anime that much anymore. Last one I liked was Shin-Chan when it first came on but kind of lost interest in it because the later episodes lacked the charm I had with the ones from the first season
<otakon> well I guess that explains his fear of snakes
<Midnight_Fyre> Hey guys, guess what I just bought 5 minutes ago
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Killer Rhino... :O
<Darf14> man, he wants to hurt a kid
<Ryunosuke> oh mai
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> XD
<RaveBrony> Oh damn
<CriticKitten> ....is that Samwise?
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Ow.
<Kandarihu> Tovler, if you start taking interest in Madoka, then you should hurry up and watch it before the spoilers find you.
<pony_6049> lol
<Darf14> He has the weirdest boner
<JESmith71> (And I'm talking about the FUNi dub of course)
<derpyface> HES ONLY A BOY SCOUT
<otakon> JESmith71: you know the creator of Shin Chan passed away a while ago right?
<Sharakan> that explains his fear of rhinos
<DrGanjalf|Adventurer> 0__0
<JESmith71> Otakon sadly yes
<derpyface> this happens in real life
<Reikim> Tovler: What Kanda said. It's really worth it, I swear.
<otakon> JESmith71: yh sucks
<derpyface> is this based on a true story?
<Fedora_Quick_Thinker> shoot i did the epic stuff and i fail
<otakon> even sounds like Indy
<Meanwhile> Dat way out of this.
<Bronysith> What is the difference between a man and a parasite? A man builds. A parasite asks 'Where is my share?' A man creates. A parasite says, 'What will the neighbors think?' A man invents. A parasite says, 'Watch out, or you might tread on the toes of God... '
<Vivix> Lion?
<otakon> and then Lion
<WalkerPony89> At least this guy isn't trying to stab Indy
<Vivix> Aww Yeahh
<PinkiePieYoshi64> He ded
<derpyface> Oh he get that scar
<Darf14> oh a kitty :)

<otakon> This guy has been reading a bible for goddamn 2000 years
<Ryunosuke> that old knight
<CriticKitten> otakon: Problem though. The camera faced Indy and it wasn't visible even though it should have been from that angle. :P

<otakon> Sumica: true
<Vordox> Sumica: ....How?
<otakon> Vordox: no idea
<DaringDoFan> Vordox, how do you know that Indy doesn't know Latin?
<Fedora_Kandarihu> Vordox, he's from the times of the Crusades, and such he speaks an archaic form of English.
<Vordox> DaringDoFan: Nice try :
<twilight_sprinkle> bad guy figured everything out too
<otakon> bc this guy knows what he's saying
<RaveBrony> Wow :D
<DerpyMuffins> How do toy know they speak latin
<CriticKitten> I love this.

<Sumica> 00,10he listend to the radio Vordox
<kirz|art> haven't even seen the movie in years
<CriticKitten> This is the best part of the movie, and it shows that the writers knew what they were talking about.

<DerpyMuffins> Chose the gold one
<DaringDoFan> The cup of a carpenter...
<otakon> DaringDoFan: too soon
<Eulshy> The pewter one
<Fedora_Kandarihu> Well, it's not like they were still speaking Latin in the middle ages.
<Sumica> 00,10it's the cup that says number 1 son on it
<magmablock> Choose the simple one
<Fedora_Quick_Thinker> she wanted him to die
<DerpyMuffins> Ofc its that one
<Zephyr> its the one with Jesus' name written by sharpie
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<Ponies47> Yes we all know the very fancy one is always the correct one. :|
<otakon> It's the one that says "I'm Eggscelent" on it
<twilight_sprinkle> she probably chose wrong to help indy
<Tov_Men> Its the one made of non-radioactive stable Lawrencium.
<Fedora_Daygon> LOL Sumica
<magmablock> Remember, at the time of the Last Supper, it was just an ordinary grail.
<WalkerPony89> Because Jesus wasn't a humble guy...
<Darf14> so one out of 100 will sap 100HP every second . FOREVER
<Vordox> It's mage of Ageniuom,

<magmablock> There would be no reason humble citizens would have something so ornate
<Sumica> 00,10just pick it up out of the blue
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: hm, i would choose the one that says "i hate mondays"
<Fedora_Quick_Thinker> its the one that says im JESUSLICIOUS on it

<Darf14> now he has a bullet in his stomache
<EonMastor> that wound washed right off
<otakon> since you still grow old and weak
<DerpyMuffins> Did they even remove the bullet?
<RaveBrony> As is mine :)
<kirz|art> Last Crusade is the best of the 3 Indiana Jones movies

<twilight_sprinkle> i wouldnt expect it to be true
<Vordox> Kawaii_icybeauti: Which pony?
<Dken2021> what chu guys talking about?
<twilight_sprinkle> doesnt really make sense

<Kawaii_icybeauti> Vordox: He wants to make a fan made charecter that could possibly be in the show. Besides derpy and stuff
<Vordox> Kawaii_icybeauti: Who?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Crimson_Phoenix: He started the brony. You know the little article "The end of the creater driven era?"

<Kawaii_icybeauti> Crimson_Phoenix: Come on, it's genius. We can't use brony because that would be to obvi...I swear it's perfect.
<Crimson_Phoenix> Kawaii_icybeauti, that's not how Brony started
<Dken2021> hehehe
<CriticKitten> So, wow, the paint might actually do something. O.o
<Sumica> 00,10they are all trying to hide boners
<Kawaii_icybeauti> 4chan is my second idea though.

<Crimson_Phoenix> Kawaii_icybeauti, you're also missing the concept of what Brony2447 want
<Eulshy> FOR PONY
<Vordox> Kawaii_icybeauti: I find this.... very very.. "untrue"?
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> For Ponies
<CriticKitten> No volunteers?
<CriticKitten> Can't imagine why
<Crimson_Phoenix> he wants something that could fit in the show, not something that would represent the fanbase
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Yes.Applejack
<Brony2447> Crimson_Phoenix: good point
<Dken2021> CriticKitten wimps

<CriticKitten> It's just assumed.
<Eulshy> I would be scared to death

<Kawaii_icybeauti> Vordox: Yes, houdini was truley a master.

<Brony2447> Godking_Buytoast: so hows the pony goin?
<PuddingCupz> Oh Ty Dken2021
<WalkerPony89> CriticKitten: It's glass. I'm pretty sure skin and clothing isn't gonna help against giant shards of glass. Also, odds are the glass would still get past his arms and fuck up his torso
<Eulshy> After long time on google, i have found how to get an OC desktop pony yay!
<Sumica> 00,10smokeing for science
<Godking_Buytoast> i just finished actually

<CriticKitten> WalkerPony89: The first test showed no lacerations at all when he had skin. :P
<daring_derpy> good morning :)
<twilight_sprinkle> WalkerPony89: it would help if youre not diving headfirst into, and covering yourself with arms. also he sustained no damage at all the first time
<Eulshy> Sumica, I can't art, but my solution is the brilliance in itself!
<BroHoof> NOS exploded awesome
<Brony2447> Godking_Buytoast: cool cant wait to see it!
<PuddingCupz> I hope there was no people in there that episode. I forgot.

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Anyone remember Earl the caddie?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Yay spoldy time!
<Sumica> 00,10recolor, Eulshy?
<CriticKitten> WalkerPony89: In the second test they removed his skin and doubled the thickness of the glass. Of COURSE it'll do damage. He has nothing protecting him at all.
<Vordox> No spark = No fire
<Eulshy> Nope, found someone doing requests, Sumica
<Quick_Thinker> i'd never get too close to a car that just got shot

<Eulshy> Mmhmm
<WalkerPony89> twilight_sprinkle: You'd still get seriously injured if you'd have your arms up. I have no defence against him survive the first glass window unhurt, they should of called the myth plausible
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Where did the truck go?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I parked it RIGHT here
<Sumica> 00,10also Vordox, needs right air fule mixture
<CriticKitten> ....and then they blew up the mixer.

<twilight_sprinkle> WalkerPony89: i dont know if it would serious, also theres a factor of luck, and they were proving if you could survive it, not leave undamaged
<Vordox> LAWL
<Vordox> Not even a BRUISE of the Cement
<Vordox> XD
<Vordox> They need some HEAVY explosive to get that out...
<CriticKitten> Wow.
<PuddingCupz> Twister 2 Was a Loser 2
<WalkerPony89> twilight_sprinkle: Well their results were that he got seriously injured, so they gotta go by their results

<Dken2021> ther's nothing left
<Shamroc> i loved the sound it made..
<daring_derpy> not much fireworks though
<PuddingCupz> BaBoooooooooom
<CriticKitten> The truck didn't even explode. It was there one second, and GONE the next, replaced with this explosion.
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: that poor car was atomized

<WalkerPony89> twilight_sprinkle: How else were they gonna do it? Make it so he slid around so that his side slamed into the glass? That would be interesting to test, actually, but I but that was'nt their goal and I dont think they were gonna make more dummies to test that
<Brony2447> *nods head in agreement
<Vordox> Sumica: A room for myself? :D
<Spectrum_Rush> more like disintegrated sumi :S

<Vordox> Sumica: (\
<Vordox> Brony2447: Pretty much
<Brony2447> Vordox: oh ok
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sumica was a brony before it was cool
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica the Hipster Brony :S
<Sumica> 00,10hey kids could not be picky. there was only a few cartoons on a day

<prince-dari> Hah.
<Crimson_Phoenix> urhg

<Vordox> Sumica: I watched stuff here you guys NEVER heard of that's beyond awesome for those age
<superretroworld> just watched the finale of angel beats, omg was it sad
<Crimson_Phoenix> I really don't like this video

<Vordox> Brony2447: It's ..."mind f'cking"
<WalkerPony89> klkui9879899: :O Oh well, he's still awesome
*Shamroc facehoofs " Sumica your a silly filly"
<Dken2021> Quick_Thinker hopefully the human isn't one a specific frequency
<Ponies47> Back.
<Vordox> Brony2447: And I mean "Real life mind f'cking"
<Brony2447> Vordox: good mind f*ing or bad?
<Quick_Thinker> ow
<Shamroc> woo rip headphone users..
<BroHoof> my ear got raped
<Vordox> Brony2447: It's Real Life mind f'ck.
<Ponies47> There's somthing in my fridge that made me go WTF? O_O
<Quick_Thinker> im wearing headphones still alive
<Vordox> Brony2447: Give the trailer a look =P
<Quick_Thinker> but im taking them off now
<Brony2447> Vordox: ok
<Crono_brony> Hello, Everypony! How are you?
<PuddingCupz> Me too Quick_Thinker
<Dken2021> lali-ho Crono_brony
<Brony2447> Vordox: im afraid of it now :(
<twilight_sprinkle> uhh wut, the spacing IS the frequency
<potato_pony> Ponies47: what was it?
*Ponies47 Is still wearing headphones
<Vordox> Brony2447: Don't be. It's something that's a personal thing. :P
<lowfn> Hai Crono_brony I'm doing great.. and you?
<CriticKitten> In theory, everything has a resonant frequency.
<Brony2447> Vordox: ok lol
<Vordox> That's one heck of a wobble
<BroHoof> implode bitch!
<Sumica> 00,10look at the rim.
<Crono_brony> lowfn: I'm doing fantastic!
<WalkerPony89> klkui9879899: Well, shit. I had a welcome video for you, but it was deleated :(
<Kawaii_icybeauti> inb4 barrel roll
<CriticKitten> Such that if you could hit a particular resonance....the connections between the molecules themselves would start to break down.
<Ponies47> potato_pony: There was a cup of juice in ym fridge it was frozen but in the middle of it was a bunch of bendy straws rubberbanded together O_O
<klkui9879899> WalkerPony89: It's ok. I'll just take a long, warm welcome hug :)
<CriticKitten> At least that's the theory.
<Ponies47> *my
<daring_derpy> bad glass has a lot of tension in it from uneven cooling
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Try and vibrate Diamond :P
<potato_pony> Ponies47: da faq
<daring_derpy> explodes quite easily
<Ponies47> potato_pony: My step brother and step sisters are weird
<Brony2447> has any trolls ever came to this site or haters?
<Marx> What about finding the hay in the needle stack?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> or the hay in the needle stack
<Eulshy> What does her shirt have on it?
<Spectrum_Rush> Brony2447: all the time, its hilarious
<daring_derpy> Brony2447: happens, but not too often. they get kicked without discussion
<Dken2021> Brony2447 sometimes, though they aren't as effective as they think they are
<Brony2447> lol so many replies
<lowfn> Mossfessor
<Kawaii_icybeauti> That was the first time I ever heard anthrax..
<PuddingCupz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix7vrluEm4E - Welcome Video
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Like I said, the theory is if you can find the proper resonant frequency on any given item, you could hit it with a particular neutralizing frequency that would break down the molecules. I don't think the theory has ever been proven but it's cool to think about.
<Ponies47> Brony2447: PLENTY! I have been here for over 3 months and I hae seen them. If one comes on. just IGNORE them. IGNORE IGNORE IGNORE. The mods will take care of it :P
*WalkerPony89 gives klkui9879899 a hug :#

<GodHaytezFags> HEY EVERYONE
<GodHaytezFags> how's it going!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

<GodHaytezFags> FAGS BREAK DA RULES EVERY DAY
<GodHaytezFags> BUT THEY DONT GET BANNED FROM GO
<GodHaytezFags> FROM LIFE
<CriticKitten> Vordox: It would make an amazing military application. Imagine a gun that can fire resonant waves that break down your target at the molecular level.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> We just send them to the moon.
<Jmo4267> prince-dari pls.
<twilight_sprinkle> GodHaytezFags: banned from cs:go?
<Buytoast> because they're a bunch of annoying little buggers that try to force the damned show into every aspect of life

<Chrysalis> i have no idea how hes getting so many new idents
<Chrysalis> daring_derpy he was being an ass last night
<Chrysalis> then evaded and got permabanned
<PuddingCupz> how
<Panda> Chrysalis using different ports
<daring_derpy> Chrysalis: delete flash cache, get new ip number, new id ready
<Chrysalis> yeah but a new ip that quick is impressive
<daring_derpy> my personal record on another chat is 27 bans in an hour
<LeGoup> i do it in 5 secs -_-
<Chrysalis> man my router takes a full minute to get me a new IP
<Sumica> 00,10ok so would you like to go for network ban then LeGoup?
<LeGoup> well no
<Sumica> 00,10because you are working your way to one
<LeGoup> but
<LeGoup> sumica pls listen
<PuddingCupz> Chrysalis: How did he get banned. I know he was a ass but what kind of ass?
<LeGoup> ive been banned for no reason

<Greenkill> is there rules somewhere cause i dont wanna be banned :(
<LeGoup> no reason
<PuddingCupz> DRINK
<Vordox> Issue arising here I see.
<andy> the rules button in top of screen Greenkill
<Chrysalis> http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
<daring_derpy> wrek is a bit moody when it comes to banning
<Vordox> Investigation required here, mods?
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Dat bicyclerepairman
<PuddingCupz> wait if ur sleeping how can u anser?
<sub06905> SuperBrony64|Zzz: back to bed silleh filleh :3
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02><
<Sumica> 00,10well guess what, ban evading to say the ban was wrong is not ther right way.
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64|Zzz are you STILL awake
<Vordox> SuperBrony64|Zzz: Weren't you sleeping? :P
<Chrysalis> you should of been in bed ages ago
<Vordox> Sumica: He's just trying to commune before a prejudged ban
<Vordox> Sumica: Pretty standard reaction to someone that feels unjustified maybe?
<LeGoup> well, and what am i supposed to say in the ban appeal, NO REASON? like anyone would believe me....
<Chrysalis> thats what the appeal email is for
<Sumica> 00,10PM's still work
<Chrysalis> LeGoup thats what chatlogs are for, theyd probably go back through
<Ryunosuke> still, evading a ban to dispute said ban IN PUBLIC, is NOT the right way to do things
<Vordox> Ryunosuke: It can be. :P
<Brony2447> im back
<Ryunosuke> no, its not
<LeGoup> i know
<Vordox> Ryunosuke: It's called Public Opinion and exposure.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02LeGoup...
<Brony2447> wtf is goin on?
<LeGoup> and im sorry
<LeGoup> but
<Ryunosuke> that just makes you look like an ass and a douche
<LeGoup> when i asked for a reason
<Chrysalis> Brony2447 stream is showing animation errors from season 1
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Just send an appeal explaining what happened and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.
<Vordox> Ryunosuke: No, it does not.
<Chrysalis> chat is discussing bans
<Greenkill> now i habe read the rules
<LeGoup> :C oaky
<Sumica> 00,10guess what making a public desplay of it wont help your case
<Greenkill> have*
<Brony2447> Chrysalis: lol ok
<sub06905> insta pies, brought to you by Spike
<BroHoof> trolestia
<daring_derpy> until then, use a less obvious id, LeGoup
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02If you give us a good reason to unban you, we'll consider it.
<LeGoup> well
<LeGoup> do i still have a chance?
<Sumica> 00,10did that one wrong
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Yes
<LeGoup> okay....
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Everyone who is banned has a chance to appeal to be unbanned.
<sub06905> put bag and blanket
*Vordox listens intently to this, considering I am based on neutrality in these cases.
<Sumica> 00,10and to be frank LeGoup, it was a time ban that you recived.
<Dismo> I remember my ban, me and Wreck got into an argument.
<LeGoup> 24 hours i know
<LeGoup> but no reason was given
<LeGoup> so i came back
<Chrysalis> i dont think i could go 24hours without bronystate
<LeGoup> and asked for it
<daring_derpy> fluttershy a mud pony?
<LeGoup> and then i remember the guy made fun of me
<Sumica> 00,10you know the page still loads yes?
<LeGoup> i dont remember his nme
<Ryunosuke> legroup, i know bronystate is the best chat ever, but really, is 24 hours really that bad of a ban? :)
<LeGoup> it is, when youre bored
<Vordox> Ryunosuke: It got nothing with that. :P
<LeGoup> believe me
<Chrysalis> man the boredome
<Chrysalis> 24hours without chat
<LeGoup> hey SuperBrony64|Zzz im sorry , ill try to appeal it, i guess i cant stay here now can i? :C
<sub06905> fluttershy was a long legged filly
<Chrysalis> was your 24hours up?
<Vordox> Time Ban =/= Perma ban
<Vordox> They are not the same, but considering you are have been warned with that time ban, and that's what you wish to appeal to question on what terms.
<MadSurge> sub06905: fan fact, that's how real baby horses look
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02LeGoup: Sorry, you can't. If you're banned, you can't stay until you are unbanned. Just send an email, and hopefully things will be alright :)
<MadSurge> *fun
<sub06905> MadSurge: :o
<scottish-geeky-drawl> Ponies47: DeathStar hay gees what
<LeGoup> and another question
<Vordox> SuperBrony64|Zzz: Wasn't it a TIme Ban?
<LeGoup> am i banned from every theater?
<MadSurge> sub06905: also, she's one year older, remember?
<DeathStar> scottish-geeky-drawl: pickles?
<sub06905> MadSurge: oh yes thats right
<Chrysalis> the theatre rooms all link to this one except on official streams
<LeGoup> ....
<scottish-geeky-drawl> DeathStar: nope i just finshd two new drwalings
<sub06905> lol
<sub06905> dat sticker
<Vordox> So what case is LeGroup on?
<PuddingCupz> Drink!
<sub06905> Rainbow dash hit 88mph
<Vordox> Perma Ban or Time Ban? Cause this seems to be double ban here for some reason.
<MadSurge> ^
<PuddingCupz> DRINK SHE IS MISSING HER FRECKALS
<daring_derpy> LeGoup: don't get caught ban evading until this is taken care of. technically, there is only one theater now anyway. the main #bronystate channel
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02LeGoup: Yes, when you are banned, you are banned from all of BronyState's official chat rooms.
<Chrysalis> did you not see the math? rainbow dash can cruise at mach5
<Ryunosuke> but not the network
<LeGoup> omg D:
<Chrysalis> and after a sonic rainboom, can fly at mach 10
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02If you have further questions, feel free to PM me or send the appeal to bronystate@gmail.com
<sub06905> lol
<sub06905> no drinks for awhile now
<PuddingCupz> DRINK
<daring_derpy> hehe
<Chrysalis> man, now i feel bad, 2 people got removed from the chat :( i only inteded to point out rdashies ban evasion :(
<sub06905> socks in trash can?!
<Vordox> What the heck is happening here Mods...?
<sub06905> Socks now cannon
<FUS_RO_yay> Yeah, i just joined, what happened?
<Sumica> 00,10Chrysalis, same person
<Chrysalis> ah legoup = rdashie?
<Sumica> 00,10yes
<Chrysalis> i dont feel bad anymore
<sub06905> lol Chrysalis
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Vordox: LeGoup and RDashie are the same person. What was once a timeban, turned into a permaban due to ban evading.
<Vordox> SuperBrony64|Zzz: And person knew this?
<Vordox> (Aka read the rules)
<Chrysalis> it turned into a permaban about 1 minute after the time ban last night
<Sumica> 00,10it was posted in the kick message as well Vordox
<Panda> Vordox when you first come here it is implied you know the rules >.>
<PuddingCupz> Yeah
<Vordox> Using Light Irc, Mica, so cannot see those
<MadSurge> Brb gotta take out trash and plastic
*daring_derpy never reads rules
<Chrysalis> the rules are listed in the channel topic (/topic)
<Vordox> I can say, from what I saw <-- WTF IS THAT
<Sumica> 00,10light irc stoped showing them?
<PuddingCupz> KICK!
<Brony2447> how lng is this vid T_T
<Ryunosuke> CYCLOPS
<daring_derpy> all hail to our new cyclops overlords
<Vordox> Sumica: Using the HTML one so I cannot see it, unless it's shown in the main ponychat startup Irc
<Greenkill> last episode
<Brony2447> ok
<PuddingCupz> YAY
<Vordox> Which it does not.
<Panda> daring_derpy well its a good thing you are a good pony eh? :D
<daring_derpy> :) always
<thegt90> me in 20 years http://funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/3989456/Why+i+shouldn+t+be+a+father/
<Chrysalis> the eyes :O
<Vordox> I can say, from what I saw from RDashie yesterday was "Strong personality" that can make other people deduce a fast statement, even implying rude. But Strong opinions are allowed, as long as it never escaltes.
<Vordox> Unless it's rudely behavour on it, then it requires change, no doubt. What case was RDashie?
<Sumica> 00,10yep gonna call ya a lier Vordox
<Ponies47> Holy crap I better go to bed IRL now :$
<Sumica> 00,10popup window says the exact message of the kick.
<Ponies47> Good night everypony :)
<sub06905> night Ponies47

<Chrysalis> Vordox if your on the webclient you wont
<Sumica> 00,10the person kicked gets the message
<Vordox> Oh yeah that I see. :P

<Ryunosuke> i can cause I am using hydra ;)
<PuddingCupz> No... not season two!

<Chrysalis> Vordox if your on an external client you can see them
<Vordox> Yeah but Rdashie said he did not get a reason for the ban..
<daring_derpy> oh wow
<Vordox> That's something I'm worried about
<daring_derpy> season 2?
<Vordox> Chrysalis: That I know, but I'm using Light IRc, as stated.
<Greenkill> what's this?
<Brony2447> SO HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA BE.........

<Sumica> 00,10I have kicked 270 times sence I added the timer
<Ryunosuke> thats how many kicks sumica has done
<Vordox> ... That's a suprising effect.
<Chrysalis> surely its a counter not a timer
<Spectrum_Rush> RDashie probably cliked out of the window quickly and never saw the message
<daring_derpy> so much plot
<Sumica> 00,10true
<Vordox> Wait.. YOU have kicked?
<Ryunosuke> 250 of those kicks is otakon spamming :)
<DeathStar> scottish-geeky-drawl: well you can right click someones name in the list of people in chat, or just click it a bunch of times
<Sumica> 00,10it's also 230am so brain is more duh then normal

<sub06905> i prefer Futurama
<MadSurge> OtakuTom: there was a revival?!
<Gold_Demona> I don't really care for Family Guy myself. Some of what they have in that show is funny, but most of it is just... bad.
<Brony2447> lemme ask somethin if yall dont mind the rulses say no vids so is that only during stream or not at all?
*sub06905 pokes Wrek|Suspended and Phase4 with a stick.
<sub06905> You awake?
<MadSurge> Brony2447: only during the stream
<MadSurge> Now you can post videos
<Aps> Sumica, i have a question
<Spectrum_Rush> sub06905: why not poke dari too
<Brony2447> MadSurge: so if iwanted to show you someting now it would be ok?
<OtakuTom> Yea. He ended the show originally in late 2001/early 2002. Rumor has it that he was supposed to be on one of the flights hijacked in the 9/11 attacks, and he decided to end it because of that.
<Sumica> 00,10hmmm?
*sub06905 poke prince-dari with stick also
<MadSurge> Brony2447: videolinks are prohibited only during stream, so yeah

<Aps> Sumica, ok theres a proper movie called Kama Sutra a tale of love
<Brony2447> MadSurge: ok thx
<OtakuTom> After the show started airing on Adult Swim, there was enough fan demand to bring the show back on Fox.
<Aps> Sumica, would that be allowed on BMN or EMN
<Aps> Sumica, its a Indian movie

<AdamTheDuck> Dat past chat...
<Brony2447> vlad!the worst vamp since count chocula...
<Kandarihu> You remember in Chapter 3 when Vlad was flying the airship, and he suddenly left the helm claiming to sense a disturbance in his village? That's why
<LegoBrony> Wow.
<Brony2447> Kandarihu: uhh yeah if iknew wtf you were talking about i would agree
<Kandarihu> There was a lot of skippage around there.
<Brony2447> Kandarihu: so are you done playing it or did you just restart?
<Kandarihu> Er, it was now, right? Okay. The wizards came upon the village that Vlad was ruling, and he kept the villagers under his thumb with poor health
<Kandarihu> I'm not playing. I want to play, but I can't get in.
<Brony2447> i swear applejacks (cereal) should hove Apple Jack on the cover instead of the stoned apple and jamaican cinnamon. imean seriously? who wouldnt want appljack on there cereal?
<Kandarihu> I'm getting those infamous Phase4 lag times again. The stream is behind by minutes.
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, still not sure how to fix that
<Brony2447> VOTING TIME: ( ) apple jacks the way it is or ( ) apple jack on it
<Kandarihu> It's not even consistant. It might be out of your hands. It certainly didn't happen in recent days. Until today, it's been quite a while since the last time it happened.
