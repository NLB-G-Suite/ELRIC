<CupcakeWarrior> The battle system is shit
<Waffles> .-.
<otakon> NewDCD: it's a guessing game at heart later on I'm sure, I HATE rock paper scissor battle systems. Endless Space or what not had it too, and it sucked there too

<Shizuka> 13wubwub wub wub wubwubwub, priceless
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
*ofna01 wonders what Shiz is talking abou
<Pale_Horse> I played a PS game a long time ago that used a paper-rock-scissors system or combat. It was called "Dragonseeds" I think. I remember being continually frustrated at how
<NewDCD> 09,01oh man Dragonseeds
<Pale_Horse> "Coincidentally" good the computer was at guessing.
<NewDCD> 09,01dat game
<Shizuka> 13so it's six round rock paper scissors
<otakon> you have to guess ahead of time what your opponent will doahead of time and if you don't do the correct sequence you will not win ever
<ofna01> eveeer
<otakon> ever
<owlicious> ever ever ever ever
<Waffles> :|
<CupcakeWarrior> otakon: shittiest battle system ever
<ofna01> never ever ever ever ever ever?!?!
<Dynamic_Brony> F this (rolls dice) YES 16!
<NewDCD> 09,01kinda, without counting Skills and Codecasts
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: agreed, no strategy at all
<NewDCD> 09,01hey you guys
<NewDCD> 09,01cut it out : I
<MahBoi777> get inside your opponent's computerized head!

<Shizuka> 13.-.
<NewDCD> 09,01that said I have a friend who's studying game design and he's liking the game from an objective perspective
<NewDCD> 09,01so yeah
<otakon> NewDCD: well I'm not bashing on you for liking it
<mario_pony> turn around
<Waffles> i dont wanna be mean .-.
<Dynamic_Brony> dat dragon
<mario_pony> every now and then
<otakon> Attack Attack Guard, Guard Attack Attack
<Pale_Horse> "pylon Soul"... do Pylons actually HAVE souls?
<CupcakeWarrior> lucky
<mario_pony> i get a little bit worried
<ofna01> ded
<NewDCD> 09,01okay this is where it gets real
<Krakass> Baptist Pylons do, but not catholic ones
<Dynamic_Brony> Dem Metal Gear Acid
<ofna01> K
<otakon> I hope so
<owlicious> two of him?
<ofna01> AaaA
<Pale_Horse> ... and... if pylons have souls... then does that mean they have relions and afterlives too?
<ofna01> my brain hurts!
<NewDCD> 09,01ohai Prologue player character
<CupcakeWarrior> Getting real
<otakon> three of him
<Dashie_Dashie> hmm.. DAT KINGDOM HEARTS BEGINNING
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dun dun dun
<CriticKitten> DCD: Appreciate your friend's input, but I'd note that I've done some game development and I can't say I care for it myself. To each their own though
<otakon> wait
<ofna01> MY BRAIN HURTS
<MahBoi777> somethin seems fishy
<otakon> um
<NewDCD> 09,01have you played the game though CK?
<otakon> YOUR OWN DOLL TURNS ON YOU AND KILLS YOU!?
<NewDCD> 09,01it's a different thing to play it
<Dashie_Dashie> This level design = Kingdom hearts beginning level.
<CriticKitten> Howso? Does it institute time limits?
<otakon> yeah we just saw that
<MahBoi777> otakon: makes sense, dolls are evil
<otakon> apparently
<Dynamic_Brony> LOSE LOSE LOSE
<Dashie_Dashie> dat chain
<Pale_Horse> Last player character I had that lasted only through the prologue and croaked after was the guy at the start of "Calling".
<otakon> and here come the crap shoot
<ofna01> ded
<otakon> and we see NewDCD getting his ass kicked again
<CupcakeWarrior> CHEAP AS SHIT
<Waffles> scary game .-.
<CriticKitten> If it starts forcing you to pick your options quickly, then sure, it could be ugly. But I'm not too fond of a system whose combat basics grant you a 33% chance of picking the correct option
<MahBoi777> aw man
<otakon> ded
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ehmm someone have a google docs or pdf of "Eternal" please ?
<Dynamic_Brony> GAME OVER! for real
<LadyCanary> D:

<CriticKitten> It's not? But that's what the tutorial just presented. You select from three options, of which only one yields an ideal result of damage. One yields a tie, and one is bad.
<Everlasting_Joy> Never give up, never give in.
<Pale_Horse> Yours it the Drill that will pierce the Heavens!
<Dynamic_Brony> Stand FOR EQUESTRIA!!!
<MahBoi777> you're the best AROUND

<MahBoi777> bye mario_pony, and he's gone
<SaxyPretender> 0,14man, Archer's so snarky
<Waffles> ATTACKK!!
<Dynamic_Brony> LUCKY
<Pale_Horse> This whole Holy Grail thing sounds pretty violent. Can't the masters just take turns playing slap-hands instead?
<Waffles> are those cubes?
<MahBoi777> or a ravishing game of say uncle perhaps?
<Waffles> uncle
<otakon> oh look more cubes to fight
<CupcakeWarrior> More luck based bullshit!
<NewDCD> 09,01it's not luck-based
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>implying there's not apattern
<NewDCD> 09,01the enemies actually have patterns
<NewDCD> 09,01you gotta decypher it by using your brain
<Waffles> is it more training?
<NewDCD> 09,01you know, something most people seem to hate doing
<Krakass> Powerpoint is now a currency?
<Dynamic_Brony> VR Mission
<NewDCD> 09,01it's more of a puzzle based system than a luck based one
<CupcakeWarrior> Krakass: lol
<MahBoi777> gotta get inside the enemies head
<Dynamic_Brony> waiting
<otakon> yh, but not all of them follow a pattern 100% of the time, and considering a wrong choice can result in no damage or taking critical damage it really is seemingly luck based
<NewDCD> 09,01that's what techniques and code casts are for
<NewDCD> 09,01if you can't plan accordingly and take precautions for taking damage
<otakon> you just took friggin 25% damage from TWO HITS
<NewDCD> 09,01you're just not very much of a clever pony : I
<otakon> no, I prefer some actual TACTICS
<Tarku> ohai guise :)
<NewDCD> 09,01if we go by that logic
<NewDCD> 09,01all RPGs are luck-based
<MahBoi777> hi Tarku!
<NewDCD> 09,01what with they just being a collection of RNGs
<otakon> um but you have more options than just 3 actions
<Pale_Horse> Eh... Like I said, I played Dragonseeds back in the day, and this system looks much much better than what that game had.
<otakon> that's the difference
<CupcakeWarrior> I just thought there wasnt any patterns
<Shizuka> 13dice are so not RNGs, they KNOW man... they KNOW when you need a certain roll...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<otakon> Shizuka: eeyup, and they LOVE screwin you over at tiems
<Mutterguy> it's magical
<Pale_Horse> Besides, Fire Emblem also had kinda a P-R-S type system kind of too, and I loved that game.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14heck, even Soul Calibur
<NewDCD> 09,01an attack pattern I kind of love
<SaxyPretender> 0,14at its core is a R/P/S
<otakon> Pale_Horse: yh, but a good Axe user COULD beat a Sword user
<SaxyPretender> 0,14which they build upon
<NewDCD> 09,01is the Bull-type enemies
<otakon> Pale_Horse: it wasn't end all be all
<Pale_Horse> that's true.
<Krakass> Uh oh. Archer is about to reveal that Santa doesn't exist.
<Dynamic_Brony> the bad news is no new pony this week
<NewDCD> 09,01they use the command they were weak to in their last attack, creating a cyclical pattern
<otakon> in this, without knowing the enemies pattern ahead of time you have a satistical chance of doing the correct action of 33%
*CupcakeWarrior secretly wishes Archer was a brony
<NewDCD> 09,01that's where levels and Information Matrixes come into play : I
<MahBoi777> I like those odds!
<NewDCD> 09,01there are mechanics for that : I
<Pale_Horse> maybe he is... >.>
<NewDCD> 09,01plus you can just...use skills as well
<Shizuka> 13otakon: you have a 33% chance of getting them all right yes, but there's a better chance of getting any of them right
<otakon> hmmm still NewDCD the battle system could be improved,
<Waffles> its a cellphone
<otakon> Shizuka: but that's where over options come up that don't OUTRIGHT FAIL
<SaxyPretender> 0,14this is just the start, yes?
<NewDCD> 09,01otakon
<SaxyPretender> 0,14you haven't seen ALL the system has to offe
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*offer
<Shizuka> 13right
<NewDCD> 09,01it works better in practice than it sounds
<otakon> oh fine
<NewDCD> 09,01just sit back and watch
<otakon> I would hope so
<Shizuka> 13being the start i can already see this has lots of potential to be awesomeness
<Waffles> :[
<otakon> bc every thing I've read so far says the combat is the weakest part in the gaem
<rainbowdash002> whats he playing
<NewDCD> 09,01let me just unlock Alteration of the Soul and then we'll talk

<flutter_spin> This seriously is called The Matrix?
<NewDCD> 09,01Shizuka you going to sleep? D:
<NewDCD> 09,01no, Information Matrix
<Shizuka> 13jaja.. tired...
<MahBoi777> gnight Shizuka
<NewDCD> 09,01basically think of it as the notebook from L.A. Noire
<SonicRainboom> ...
<SonicRainboom> Too bad I don't know what L.A. Noire is.
<flutter_spin> ugh, not LA Noire
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Night Shizuka

<SonicRainboom> That guys a total ass, by the way.
<flutter_spin> Its cool, but everytime I tried to catch someone in a lie... my guy goes ballistic and just accuses him of burning down the whole town
<pony_7477> It is the sequal to True Crime:Streets of L.A.
<Krakass> he's a total cranky doodle donkey

<SonicRainboom> Is that a goddamn cube/

<SonicRainboom> ...
<otakon> night Shizuschlafen sleep well dear
<SonicRainboom> Really.
<CupcakeWarrior> waiting
*MASF123 leaves
<otakon> also, I think it would have helped to actually show what attacks the enemy uses when they execute them, since ALL THE ACTIONS look the same if they're following a pattern it's hard to tell what it is
<NewDCD> 09,01: I
<NewDCD> 09,01you know it's really annoying when people do that
<MahBoi777> I can't brain today
<otakon> NewDCD: I'm sorry, it's just my take on the game so far
<NewDCD> 09,01and they do, thing is, you have to brain
<NewDCD> 09,01If your ATTACK was successful
<NewDCD> 09,01they were using BREAK
<owlicious> if it failed, guard
<SonicRainboom> Some people don't have brains, DCD.
<owlicious> if it tied, attack
<otakon> ok fine
<NewDCD> 09,01if you get an EVEN -Equal Bloodshed-, he was using an Attack
<NewDCD> 09,01exactly
<otakon> jeez it is 1 am atm
<CupcakeWarrior> Do you fight him now?
<otakon> I'm not exactly in tiptop form atm
<CupcakeWarrior> dem boobs
<otakon> wat boobs?
<MahBoi777> bewbs
<otakon> okay nvm good lord
<Pale_Horse> How does she not fall out of that outfit? Double-sided tape?

<otakon> wait
<Pale_Horse> This fight... seems to be going south...
<otakon> SHE HAS HOW MUCH HP!?
<SonicRainboom> Sorry if this is obvious... It seems you're slightly outmatched, my friend.
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh shit
<otakon> she's using Break alot man!
<NewDCD> 09,01Servant battles in the Arena are prohibited
<NewDCD> 09,01you basically have to only survive three turns
<NewDCD> 09,01so it's no biggie
<SonicRainboom> Oh.
<SonicRainboom> Well, then.
<otakon> well good lord man you couldn't have put up a fight?
<Waffles> .-.
<NewDCD> 09,01not really...here's where the Information Matrix system comes nto play
<otakon> no nvm sorry
<Pale_Horse> but... you use swords...
<otakon> That came out the completely wrong way, I retract my statement and apologize
<NewDCD> 09,01Archer actually uses a BOW THAT FIRES SWORDS
<MahBoi777> he did give a menacing stare though
<NewDCD> 09,01he's that badass
<Pale_Horse> *brain asplodes*
<SonicRainboom> Whoa.
<CupcakeWarrior> WHOA
<NewDCD> 09,01when you gain extra notches of the Information Matrix, you can also see your opponent's attacks
<NewDCD> 09,01so yeah
<SonicRainboom> So, your goal now is to sneak around and gather all the info you can?
<SonicRainboom> That's remarkably simple.
<Pale_Horse> You're fighting a.... symbol?
<SonicRainboom> ...
<Krakass> An evil symbol
<SonicRainboom> Apparently, he is.
<Pale_Horse> well, it's no stranger than fighting a sphere or a cube...
<SonicRainboom> I can't see anything.
<SonicRainboom> Oh, there we go.
*Mutterguy noms pizza righy making everyone hungry
<MahBoi777> now I'm hungry
<SonicRainboom> Now a real opponent.
<Pale_Horse> The enemies in this game have no rhyme or reason.
<SonicRainboom> A goddamn insect.
<SonicRainboom> Well, everyone's gotta start somewhere.
<Krakass> Oooh, Mr Poniator
<CupcakeWarrior> Great enemy design game
<MahBoi777> YAY
<NewDCD> 09,01it's reflective of the fact that this is basically a game world
<NewDCD> 09,01kind of like a video game
<otakon> um
<PartyCannon> xD
<NewDCD> 09,01inside the arena I mean
<otakon> did anyone else get freaked out at the end of the MrPoniator video?
<SonicRainboom> Na.
<otakon> Imean just a bit
<NewDCD> 09,01I mean the arena is a "Virtual Training Ground"
<SonicRainboom> It was obvious where that was going.
<Pale_Horse> Oh man... It' 1:00 AM...
<otakon> damn I must be more tired then I thought
<otakon> damn
<Pale_Horse> And I have a dentist appt tomorrow...
<otakon> I have a open interview to go to
<Pale_Horse> Got to get a filling replaced that fell out.

<Pale_Horse> yeah. I should really head to bed. take good care everypony.
<Pale_Horse> ciao.

<Krakass> It's weird that the audio keeps working and the waiting appears in the top right

<Krakass> Unless the stream just keeps displaying the last thing shown
<NewDCD> 09,01it's my USB cable
<NewDCD> 09,01it keeps disconnecting

<MahBoi777> so how's the ME3 Multiplayer? it good?

<Midnight_Tempest> i havent played the multiplayer yet, but i hear its decent
<MahBoi777> ah

<RanDT2> Buhahahahahaa!!!
<SonicRainboom> Love and tolerance... Love and tolerance...
<d3rb> lol
<CupcakeWarrior> So the school doesnt like people showing displays of affection
<MahBoi777> LOL
<SonicRainboom> Ah, screw this.
<Midnight_Tempest> dumb religion is dumb
<d3rb> great school
<SonicRainboom> I hate uber-religious people.
<d3rb> people can be what they want just dont force it onto others
<CupcakeWarrior> On an unrelated note: >mfw there is a Celestia Street in my town
<Mutterguy> it's almost a foreign concept to me
<d3rb> get out, no wayy
<SonicRainboom> That almost makes up for it.
*RainbowJack hugs cupcakewarrior
<SonicRainboom> Wait...
<SonicRainboom> 6_9 PONY STREET!

<d3rb> "borrow" the street sign
<Phase4> in the me3 faq they allways say "EA Origin Account", horribly written legal bull#### document
<Midnight_Tempest> like all documents of the type?
<Midnight_Tempest> needless to say, im now more pumped about playing ME3... that cinematic trailer was amazing
<CupcakeWarrior> legal documents=instant bullshit
<MahBoi777> I wish they had a release date for Bioshock Infinite
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't buy ME3 on PC if you really want to buy it.
<CupcakeWarrior> I wish they had a release date for Fighting is Magic
<AndroUser> Hi ! I'm back.
<Phase4> ohai AndroUser
<d3rb> hey Androuser
<AndroUser> It's ne ashinysky
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And if you have to, don't go on Bioware's forums.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If you get banned there, you'll lose your games.
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord: untill the whole origin thing i was thinking of buying it
<Phase4> wait what?
<d3rb> lol serrious
<SonicRainboom> We bronies need to find a desert, and upon it build a glorious city where there are ponies in every window, and every street is named after a pony... -Has gone on delusional rant-
<Phase4> that doesnt sound legal
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Serious.
<Midnight_Tempest> i already preorded the game for PC Nittany_Discord... didnt cost me any money cause i had credit at gamestop :D
<SonicRainboom> Mid, winning.
<CupcakeWarrior> gamestop owns
*Phase4 is going to verify that and if its true he will never purchase an ea product
<SonicRainboom> Even though I hate that song.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's good.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Wow, sounds like real scumbags
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's true.
<MahBoi777> lol
<SuperBrony64> 10,02What a coincidence.

<Midnight_Tempest> i never go on game forums anyway, so ill be fin
<Midnight_Tempest> fine*
<MahBoi777> call of pony 4? LOL
<CupcakeWarrior> lol Call of Duty
<Mutterguy> I'm not sure but i think theres probably enough farm land here that a City could be built if we get the various resource consents... otherwise try Australia
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CoD is fun. I wish they weren't published by Activision though.
<Midnight_Tempest> its not Biowares fault that EA is a company of douchebags, they make my favorite games
<Mutterguy> you kind of have to worry about water and power supply though
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. Sad.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Stream is up now
<MahBoi777> O_o
<CupcakeWarrior> YAY

<Kammerjunk> Hey.
<TOY_PON3|Math> About 20 minutes
<TOY_PON3|Math> ?
<Kammerjunk> So, uh...
<Kammerjunk> Apparently, EU has suspended ACTA ratification.
<MASF123> I'll be off in a little while
<Kammerjunk> Have fun.
<d3rb> awesome
<dshannon> and yes it is times like these that you really don't want me on your minecraft server
<TOY_PON3|Math> Kammerjunk: Sorry I'm a stupid American what does that mean?
<Phase4> Sucess!
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON3|Math: yea, about 20-30 minutes give or take
<Kammerjunk> TOY_PON3|Math: They're taking it to Europe's highest court to find out if it violates and EU rights.
*Phase4 updated from 32bit win7 to 64bit whith a linux install still working
<TOY_PON3|Math> Kammerjunk: Oh okay
<MahBoi777> ohai Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi.
*Phase4 is going to join mc soon
<dshannon> basically what I knew would happen
<Phase4> test.du.cx i assume
<MahBoi777> LOL shed.
<TOY_PON3|Math> mfw I have yet to own minecraft :|
<d3rb> ^
<Kammerjunk> I played Minecraft before it was cool.
<Dashie_Dashie> Mfw I bought minecraft when it was the cheapest
<Dashie_Dashie> :D
<d3rb> teraria is a cheap substitute
<MahBoi777> LOL
<TOY_PON3|Math> Dashie_Dashie: >.>
<dshannon> I got both so meh
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Like it Dashie_Dashie? :3
<Kammerjunk> Terraria is 2D and has more goals than Minecraft.
<AndroUser> Mfw when minecraft got lame updates
<MahBoi777> teh colors @_@
<TOY_PON3|Math> SuperBrony64 gave my Terraria so I enjoy it more
<TOY_PON3|Math> me*
<Kammerjunk> As far as I'm concerned, Minecraft and Terraria are not comparable.
<TOY_PON3|Math> ^
<dshannon> minecraft has 3d
<d3rb> fair call
*Phase4 is going to join now
<dshannon> terraria has legitmately got guns
<Kammerjunk> But yeah, I prefer to play Minecraft of the two.
<AndroUser> 3d is.graphical and doesn't matter.
<MahBoi777> spin-offs, spin-offs everywhere
<Kammerjunk> Hey, SB.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hai Kammerjunk ^_^
<Kammerjunk> You should totally make a giant Celestia propaganda poster with the words "OBEY".
<TOY_PON3|Math> mfw I'm into Minecraft only for the creations ._.
<Phase4> Damnit!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Kammerjunk lol
<Phase4> have to download java
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Maybe another time :3
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, it takes a while.
<MahBoi777> Placebo was tryin to make a giant Rainbow Dash in Minecraft, he's almost finished, LOL
<dshannon> suuuu....might I join you fine minecraftians?
<dshannon> in dat servoi?
<Kammerjunk> I see a little silhouette of an Enderman.
<dshannon> wtf is wrong with me.....
<d3rb> ?
<TOY_PON3|Math> mfw I don't understand what's so great about minecraft .______________________.
<MahBoi777> it gets boring after awhile imo
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You can basically craft anything you want ^_^
<SuperBrony64> 10,02That's the cool part :D
<Kammerjunk> TOY_PON3|Math: It's a giant Lego sandbox!
<TOY_PON3|Math> Now I want it even more... :(
*dshannon slaps kammer
<Kammerjunk> It's perfect to satisfy any OCD needs.
<Dashie_Dashie> Hm...
<MahBoi777> but I admit building stuff is awesome
<Dashie_Dashie> Let's all buy Garry's mod for Bronystate craft night!
<Kammerjunk> Why, dshannon? D:
<AndroUser> I'm with terrariA
<MahBoi777> Gmod?? LOL
<dshannon> .....lego? really?
*MASF123 getting ready to leave
<TOY_PON3|Math> Dashie_Dashie: I don't even know how to use Gmod I will NEVER know
<Kammerjunk> Can you make a better analogy?
<Phase4> download minecraft, complains about java, start downloading java
<Phase4> world hole
<Dashie_Dashie> That's the fun of G mod
<dshannon> do you need to make one?
<TOY_PON3|Math> .____.
<MahBoi777> Gmod is fun
<Dashie_Dashie> also I have a Reese's Mc'flurry from Mc'donalds

<AndroUser> Cya everypony.
<MahBoi777> bye AndroUser
<Kammerjunk> Depends on the mode.
<dshannon> lol
<MASF123> bye AndroUser
<Kammerjunk> Granted, in Lego, you don't get to BE in your creaton.
<Kammerjunk> Or fight Skeleton.
<Spanner-pony> Wow.
<Spanner-pony> Thats laggy.
<Kammerjunk> Or be freaked out by an Enderman suddenly teleporting right in your face.
<MahBoi777> THE ALMIGHTY DIRT FORT
<TOY_PON3|Math> But it's expensive though...
<Simon2> SuperBrony64:
<TOY_PON3|Math> I'm poor...

<Jim> ofna01: Dinky Doo is Derpy's little sister
<CountDoofus> or sister
<Jim> or daughter, not sure
<CountDoofus> :D
<Iwubponiez> daughter
<KwakLad> Dinky Doo is Ditzy (Derpy) Doo's daughter ofna01
<ThatsAShinySky> Sounds exciting. Let's see this.
<BronyinJapan> in the fanfictions she is the adopted dauthger of derpy
<ThatsAShinySky> Lol.
<ofna01> adopted
<ThatsAShinySky> That's is hilarious.
<ofna01> but she looks just like her!
<Phase4> http://johnjoseco.deviantart.com/ this guy
<KwakLad> Daughter is the most common explanation
<CCCP> :/
<CountDoofus> according to the fans at least, I've never seen it established as such in the actual show
<CCCP> ;(
<Iwubponiez> who is ditzy?
<CCCP> :'(
<ThatsAShinySky> Thanks Jim :)
<KwakLad> Ditzy is Derpy Iwubponiez
<Iwubponiez> no she is not
<Iwubponiez> silly
<Phase4> she could be
<Iwubponiez> derpy is derpy :P
<CountDoofus> Derpy Hooves is the name the fans gave her
<Derpy_at_work> Phase4 in not on the clock yet
<Phase4> we've never seen them both in the same room
<Phase4> at the same time

<Iwubponiez> where derpy is called derpy
<CCCP> every one hear should have seen every episode
<Dark_Horst> mfw jj has mass effect art
<BronyinJapan> ep 14 i think
<CountDoofus> Remember the Winter Wrap-Up episode? "Ditzy Do accidentaly went north to get the southern birds!" "That featherbrain!"
<BronyinJapan> of season 2
<Derpy_at_work> Phase4 it means i havent started work yet
<Phase4> ah
<ofna01> squeee
<Phase4> ep 14, the last roundup
<KwakLad> Iwubponiez: im watching it now, yeah i get called Kwak by friends irl Iwubponiez it doesnt mean thats my real name
<Saigneur> yeah it should be derpy, but there is no evidence ...

<ofna01> FUSGDFHNSHGJHNSD FK /
<Iwubponiez> rainbow dash said NOW CAREFUL DERPY and talked to her directly and ppl dnt believe her name was on the show but they believe its ditzy when shw was not actually there
<BronyinJapan> season 2 ep 14 rainbow dash calls derpy, derpy
<CountDoofus> nickname?
<Phase4> pinkie rage is possibly one of the most terrifying things in existance
<KwakLad> CountDoofus: it is Ditzy Derpy is a nickname like Kwak is for me
<StickySyrup> i thought Ditzy was her daughters name
<Jim> They said that Ditzy Doo went north to get the southern birds in the winter wrap up episode
<Jim> But we didn't see if it was derpy
<Dark_Horst> naw, that was dinky
<Phase4> i thought it wasnt that big a deal

<KwakLad> Phase4: Excalibur, hes doing it wrong!
<StickySyrup> physics has taken a major blow after the last episode
<ThatsAShinySky> It does sound like derpy going north.
<Iwubponiez> ya i know
<ofna01> "i just dont know what went wrong!" *smacks into pole*
<Phase4> KwakLad: i beg to differ
<CountDoofus> that's not breaking the fourth wall. that's putting C4 around it and blowing it to kingdom come
<BronyinJapan> get hit by lighting
<Jim> http://youtu.be/dzKfac18IYQ?t=17m8s They say Ditzy Doo here
<KwakLad> Phase 4 firstly is supposed to be a woman in a lake with a sword, not man in river with fish... but i'd still have fun trying to rule a nation with a fish
<valoreins> man... finding 2 bronies in one omegle room is like searching for gold in a dump...

<Fazana> One sec, trying to remember name
<Fazana> Ghidora
<mario_pony> Fazana: awesome
<mario_pony> Fazana: the cyborg or the original?
<Onyxiaz> no screen?
<Fazana> I prefer original, but the mechaGhidora was pretty badass as well
<mario_pony> agreed
<mario_pony> Fazana: my favorite was mothra
<Fazana> I havent seen Mothra in ages
<mario_pony> Fazana: because my first one was godzilla vs mothra
<mario_pony> the one with the eveil mothra
<mario_pony> *evil
<Fazana> I think the first one I ever watched was The final wars, got into it, and my dad had literally millions of japanese collectorware
<Fazana> I also like Gamera :3
<BronyinJapan> http://bronies.memebase.com/2011/12/10/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-mane-six-cupcakes/

<alexxm> i don't know whichone do u want to see
<mario_pony> or godzilla final wars
<mario_pony> i love to see godzilla buck up the american goszilla
<mario_pony> *zilla

<Fazana> Ironicly, the last episode of Godzilla (final wars) is the most explanatory one
<Fazana> Zilla was aweful D:
<mario_pony> alexxm: what do you mean?

<mario_pony> *american
<Fazana> Tbh, it wouldn't suprise me
<alexxm> you know it was the avgn's godzilla month that got me into it
<mario_pony> i hope they include monster fights
<Fazana> Zilla ended at a cliffhanger
<alexxm> i heard it' going to be a man in a costume for the 2nd try
<mario_pony> alexxm: their probably gonna buck that up too
<Fazana> If you've watched that megashark vs giant croc I forget the real name, you'll know peeps in suits are better than effects
<mario_pony> Fazana: i know i watched it and it sucked the special effects were just horrible
<BronyinJapan> dont look at this or you'll die of a HHNNNNG attack http://bronies.memebase.com/2011/12/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-sorry-if-i-made-you-die-of-a-hhnnnng-attack/

<RaveBrony> Kipkat07, dang, lol
<RaveBrony> I wudnt like the status O.o but you have to show Some affection
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm afraid to tell girls online or in real-life that I like them because I'm afraid of being called a stalker. It's happened before.
<RaveBrony> o_o
<The_4th_Wall> Wrek: Could you send me these playlists?
<mario_pony> back
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's happened once.
<RaveBrony> I never know when girls like me.... lol, ive had about 6 Goregeous girls want me...but stop talking to me becuz i 'ignored' them :'(

<RaveBrony> Oh.... hehe :P
<mario_pony> RaveBrony: but seriously why would you ignore them?
<mario_pony> Fazana: blunt?
<RaveBrony> I didnt ignore them, I just didnt realize they were flirting with me... and that gave them the thot that i didnt return feelings for them :(
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> not be sharp
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> dont care
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> blunt = not care
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> oh
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> or
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> TBH
<Fazana> Being blunt /= Being frank
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, it was a girl pretending to be nice on a forum. I liked her and told her, and she went neutral with that. I joined a forum she ran and supported her, but ended up booting me off for "stalking."
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> lol @ nittany_discord

<Kammerjunk> Hi, mario_pony.
<F1uttershy> what softwre is he using to draw
<valoreins> i was listening to the fox news about bronies.. they just agree to the bald man's opinion...
<valoreins> i mean wat the buck?!

<Dark_Horst> it's fox new. nothing to talk about
<eltsoldier1> oh no

<Kammerjunk> They said "50/50".
<eltsoldier1> huggen you

<Wrek> 05there is only 1 good thing i have ever seen comign from fox
<eltsoldier1> definately terrorism
<Kammerjunk> That one was silly, Nittany_Discord.
<DaniilScit> Red Eye?
<valoreins> what's that Wrek?
<Kammerjunk> DaniilScit: A Fox News segment or something.
<Dark_Horst> explain. both of you

<Wrek> 05exactly
<valoreins> whoa i'm laging :(
<Fazana> I'm back
<Fazana> Had some cerial
<F1uttershy> what software is being used to draw
<Kammerjunk> The best thing I ever saw come out of Fox News was "hackers on steroids".
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hollywood's liberal agenda." <- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztVMib1T4T4&feature=related
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Those SOPA/PIPA-supporting fuckers liberal?
<CCCP> I <3 THATVIDEO
<Fazana> Bloody SOPA
<Fazana> How about I say NOPA
<Kammerjunk> SOPA is down, though.
<ThatsAShinySky> what about PIPA and ACTA?
<valoreins> i thought sopa was dead..6_9
<CCCP> ACTA against ACTA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It is.
<Tovler> both parties support SOPA but for different reasons.
<ThatsAShinySky> i ACTA against ACTA!
<valoreins> it respawn into ACTA
<Kammerjunk> Apparently, ACTA has been suspended for ratification.
<Fazana> Wait
<Wrek> 05brb
<Fazana> They were RATting people?
<Kammerjunk> They're taking it to the highest court in Europe.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Enough. I didn't mean to start a SOPA/PIPA/ACTA debate.
<ThatsAShinySky> oh
<ThatsAShinySky> no.
<ThatsAShinySky> okay :OP
<Kammerjunk> alrightythen
<Fazana> RAT = Remove Administration Tools
<Fazana> It's like AB tutor control or Teamspeak
<Tovler> what about a PCIP debate?
<Kammerjunk> I remember having RAT once.
<Kammerjunk> That was fu.
<Kammerjunk> fun*
<Fazana> But the victim doesn't get to control the PC
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I was just stating how Fox News thought that a right-wing group like Hollywood is liberal.
<valoreins> lol rick santorum XD
<Fazana> Basically, if you get RATted by soemone who wants data, you're bucked.
<CCCP> no madder how hard we will try sooner or later the internet will be Ruined by some stupid law.
<Fazana> I'd rather it be later
<CCCP> me too
<eltsoldier1> or some stupid hacker
<eltsoldier1> lol
<Tovler> This new, environmentalism is evil thing is killing me.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RAT? It's that a DRM-removal tool?
<Fazana> Nope
<Fazana> It's a very nasty hack
<Tovler> That, and this new War on Women.
<Kammerjunk> Oh no. I meant that I had the client software, not that I was a victim of it.
<Midnight_Tempest> well, i have a great deal of respect for that Judge Napolitano guy... i had never heard of him till now but, kodos to him
<Tovler> I thought Janet Napolitano was a woman.
<F1uttershy> what drawing software is that
<Bronyzilla> Illustrator?
<Midnight_Tempest> SAI
<F1uttershy> ok thnx
<Midnight_Tempest> ugh... i hope the pain in my face is only a sinus infection and not something worse... like a sudden case of death v_v

<CCCP> I <3 that video
*Midnight_Tempest joins CCCP in the communist dance
<Sundaysmile> it's addictive
<CCCP> see it every day
<CountDoofus> sorry if I offended anyone with that last remark, wasn't my intention
<ofna01> how is he gonna make her hair?
<ofna01> since its rainbow..
<Sundaysmile> like a rainbow?
<Midnight_Tempest> with magic
<ofna01> is rainbow considered a color?
<alexxm> probably
<Sundaysmile> yes
<Kipkat07> you are the first commie that i met and i dont hate due to predjudice. I think being a brony has killed my predjudice.
<Dark_Horst> what was the band ?
<Sundaysmile> love and tolerance
<ofna01> love and tolerate kip.....
<CCCP> ^
<ofna01> CCCP
<Kipkat07> thats what i do now :D
<ofna01> just try not to get us involved in your commie ways,ok?
<CCCP> All Ponies are equal
<Midnight_Tempest> i believe in the ideals of communism and socialism, i know that they wont work though...
*Kipkat07 gives tolerance hug to CCCP
<Sundaysmile> A collective regime of peace and love
<CountDoofus> I wonder how Fluttershy'll look like in a trenchcoat
<Derpy_at_work> >.>
<Derpy_at_work> <.<
<ofna01> god,why is that picture so badass?
<Derpy_at_work> Johnjoseco is opening commisions soon
<CountDoofus> btw, is this the same drawing Wrek started working on yesterday?
<ofna01> nope
<ofna01> yesterday it was Twi
<Sundaysmile> those feathers look like kick ass blades
<CCCP> Midnight_Tempest: every single government has its own faults.
<Sundaysmile> as does it's people
<CountDoofus> yeah I know, but after Twilight, he started on another
<ofna01> thats what i thought Sundaysmile
<ofna01> is the picture a reference to something?
<ofna01> i wouldnt know
<Sundaysmile> not sure
<Sundaysmile> I remember him doing a Rarity Gunslinger pic lately
<ofna01> i do too
<ofna01> that was cool
<Sundaysmile> must be part of a theme
<ofna01> badass pony theme
<KwakLad> Sundaysmile: hes doing a syndicate themed pony set
<Sundaysmile> oooo
<Sundaysmile> very nice
<ofna01> elaborate for me?
<ofna01> i dont play Syndicate
<KwakLad> 1 sec
<KwakLad> ohh maybe hes doing different now
<Midnight_Tempest> i remember a game called syndicate... it was mid 90's old...
<Sundaysmile> sadly it's not on steam yet
<KwakLad> http://johntb.deviantart.com/art/Syndicate-Agent-273961904?q=gallery%3Ajohntb%2F32043408&qo=15
<Wrek> 05probably wont be knowing EA
<Kammerjunk> Gentlemen, BEHOLD
<Wrek> 05fuck EA
<Sundaysmile> though hopefully will be once the remake comes out
<Wrek> 05fuck origin, hard and without mercy
<Sundaysmile> it's being made by EA?
<Kammerjunk> I have made THIS THING!
<Sundaysmile> There will be blood....
<Kammerjunk> Our arrows will block out the Sun!
<Sundaysmile> Then we will makes friends in the shade?
<Kammerjunk> Why not.
<Midnight_Tempest> all this hate for EA... shame it wont stop them from raping peoples wallets
<Sundaysmile> My only gripe with em is the way they treat their consumer base
<djackson> yoyoyo
<Sundaysmile> they DO fund decent enough games, but they are a group of assholes when you get down to it
<CountDoofus> greeting djackson
<Kammerjunk> EA is pretty desperate to retain their status as the asshole of the gaming industry.
<Midnight_Tempest> i dont normally buy games anymore, but im getting ME3... oh wait, i had credit at gamestop so the game was pretty much free for me :D suck it EA
<Jim> ohai djackson
<Sundaysmile> it's pretty much chisled in stone already Kammer
<ofna01> oh,wrek,u so crazeeee
<Wrek> 05not buying ME3 either
<Wrek> 05i want to but i wont.
<Sundaysmile> I can't afford to buy ME3, though not because of cash
<Kammerjunk> Sundaysmile: Yeah, but they don't seem to be the only ones who want the questionable honour.
<ofna01> any reason?
<Wrek> 05origin exclusive
<PartyCannon> Wrek true story
<Jim> I'm not gonna buy ME3 because origin is shit
<Kammerjunk> Shame I'm terrible with names, I can't quite remember the other company.
<ofna01> wrek
<ofna01> may i make a suggestion?
<Sundaysmile> they're trying to make a EA Steam equivalent
<djackson> EA and Valve need to make up
<PartyCannon> ^
<Sundaysmile> or EA just needs to stop acting like asshats
<djackson> anyone seen the new valve logo intro for DOTA 2?
<Midnight_Tempest> nope
<PartyCannon> djackson yup, I like
<ofna01> Valve+EA=Valvea?
<djackson> its creepy as hell
<Wrek> 05Electronic Valve
<ofna01> llol
<ofna01> that actually sounds pretty good
<PartyCannon> Wrek Valve Arts
<Midnight_Tempest> *takes off sunglasses* mother of god...
<djackson> for people who havent seen it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6JXDiz0C-s
<Sundaysmile> EA - Challenge Everything - But not that. Or that. Or this. And no you can't do this.
<ofna01> whassmatta midnight?
<RaveBrony> Woah!!
<RaveBrony> This IS creepy O_o
<CCCP> i still cant tell if shes smoking
<Iwubponiez> ^
<Midnight_Tempest> i swear, if EA does manage to buy a company like Valve... i'll quit gaming all together...
<ofna01> EA Games-Challenge Everything. EXCEPT ANYTHING YOU ACTUALLY WANT
<Sundaysmile> isn't that just the HL2 intro cept he moves?
<djackson> yeah
<Midnight_Tempest> yup
<djackson> its creepy
<Midnight_Tempest> thats kinda boring
<Sundaysmile> wouldn't call it creepy
<Midnight_Tempest> i wanted to see the valve being shoved into his head... that would be creepier
<Sundaysmile> though I was expecting some heavy nightmare fuel when you said it
<Midnight_Tempest> yay, nightmare fuel... mfw i dont have nightmares anymore
<ofna01> i dont even have dreams
<Sundaysmile> can't remember my dreams... even my nightmares
<djackson> ahem... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV3cDlQpTVs&feature=related
<Sundaysmile> a shame really
<Midnight_Tempest> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2850/
<ofna01> i can remember nightmares,but not dreams
<Iwubponiez> sundaysmile youre not the only 1
<ofna01> its like every time i close my eyes its a horror movie

<Turgle> nicely done
<ofna01> NOPE
<ofna01> CHUCK TESTA
<Turgle> (:
<Jim> That's not impossibru
<Jim> It was so awesome that it made it there
<Turgle> finally!
<ofna01> impossibru is ME getting on EQD
<RaveBrony> Indeed, i can only dream of being on EQD :(
<ofna01> Wrek,he's got the talent
<RaveBrony> ^
<Iwubponiez> ofna01 no i am the one immpossible to get on EQD
<Sundaysmile> I don't understand the obsession honestly
<Iwubponiez> cus i dnt even draw :D
<RaveBrony> What obsession?
<Turgle> me neither
<Sundaysmile> of wanting to be on EQD
<ofna01> it makes you part of a sort of "elite" group of artist
<ofna01> the best of the best
<Iwubponiez> sundaysmile look at the page vewies
<RaveBrony> Oh, i just want to draw well enough to be recognized, its doesnt Have to be EQD :P
<RaveBrony> and yeah, what ofna01 said
<Iwubponiez> only elite goes to EQO
<Iwubponiez> EQD
<Iwubponiez> thats why we want to be on EQD
<RaveBrony> :)
<ofna01> i honestly think wrek could be on EQD for everyone of his drawings
<RaveBrony> ^^
<ofna01> his skil.....pardon my french....is just damn amazing
<CCCP> I just took a which pony are you test and im Flutterfhy
<RaveBrony> dat french :D
<Krakass> I don't know about that.
<Jim> oui
<Sundaysmile> Doesn't need to be on EQD to be appreciated though
<CCCP> Fluttershy*
<ofna01> lucky you,mr. commie
<Krakass> This drawing needs to be about 20% cooler if you ask me.
<CCCP> ofna01: :3
<CCCP> Krakass: i think it already is
<PartyCannon> Sundaysmile indeed, not on EQD != not good
<ofna01> LOLOLOL
<Krakass> LOL
<ofna01> a round of applause for wrek
<PartyCannon> :D
<RaveBrony> Yeah, like i draw scenery too (but i dont show anyone, becuz its not the best). When it comes to ponies, EQD means your ponies are awesome :P
<Iwubponiez> lol
<ofna01> 20% Deader?
<Radu> Dat 20% Deader
<ofna01> i cant read it
<derpy_pony> good evening
<RaveBrony> dat english :D
<Radu> Hi derpy_pony
<Jim> ohai derpy_pony
<Iwubponiez> deader?
<ofna01> evenin derp
<Sundaysmile> put it this way.... Cupcakes was posted on EQD...
<ofna01> it was quality
<DaniilScit> 20% deadlier?
<ofna01> well writin
<Radu> Yes, deader. The english may not be correct, but you get the point. No need to be grammar nazis
<RaveBrony> Hey its was VERY well written!! just....bleh
<Iwubponiez> read what he said about it
<Jim> Radu: What are you, a dictionary?
<Radu> O U
<RaveBrony> :D
<ofna01> NO U
<CCCP> Sundaysmile: to be honest i liked that fan fic for what is was tring to be....
<RaveBrony> :o
<DaniilScit> Im Estonian,my english really suck,so...
<KwakLad> thats cool
<KwakLad> very much so
<Wrek> 05puns have no need to be gramatically correct
<Wrek> 05tsk tsk
<ThatsAShinySky> 20% deader?
<Sundaysmile> and the only reason they said they'd host it was because they were pressured into it
<RaveBrony> Indeed :)
<Radu> I searched for fan fics, but I never found fics about fans
<Sundaysmile> So I'd imagine skill has little to do about it, only popularity
<ofna01> crap......i need to fix my knife
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Sundaysmile> because there are a LOT of great artists and writers out there who aren't featured on EQD but probably should be if it's for folks who are good at what they do
<Krakass> That doesn't sound ominous or anything.
<ofna01> the bolts loose
<ofna01> bolts ARE loose,more then one
<RaveBrony> I agree, SUndaysmile
<RaveBrony> *Sundaysmile
<ofna01> hahah
*RaveBrony bobs his head to this Awesome songs beat
<ofna01> yeah,its got a good beat on it
<Krakass> Yeah, that's not good. I had a folder close on me before while I was using it. Not fun.
<CountDoofus> question: what color of eyes would a the Riddler have if he was ponified
<Sundaysmile> purple
<Sundaysmile> or green
<Sumica> 00,10Well hating this permitions crap with win7.
<Sundaysmile> I can't decide!
<Sumica> 00,10"you cant save there would you rather save here instead"
<RaveBrony> Yay!! Vinyl again!

<Sumica> 00,10heh, the installer for my video driver has clips for masseffect 3 in it.
<RaveBrony> I only have a hunting knife and i Own a katana...but i dont have it atm
<Sundaysmile> probably cuts like one too
<ofna01> i know XD
<Wrek> 05but how will you learn if you dont cut tourself when you do it wrong?
<RaveBrony> ^
<Sundaysmile> yes
<KwakLad> Wrek perhaps they like pain?
<Krakass> KwakLad, I'm now picturing him pulling it out in a fancy restaurant to butter his roll.
<Sundaysmile> being tossed in the deep end is the best way to sink or swim
<RaveBrony> Rofl!
<KwakLad> Krakass: AWE-some!
<Radu> So, no episode this week?
<ofna01> http://www.bladeplay.com/item--United-Cutlery-8-Black-Triple--9087
<Iwubponiez> when did we start talking bout knifes?
<RainbowJack> nope
<Radu> !cd
<Tom> Episode 19 of season 2 "Putting Your Hoof Down" airs in 8 days, 23 hours, 13 minutes, 19 seconds (Mar 03 2012 18:00:00 GMT)
<RaveBrony> Nope, Radu
<Sundaysmile> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Sundaysmile> I forgot that
<ofna01> just ordered that a couple of days ago
<KwakLad> Krakass: But making a big show of it like he was gonna stab waiting staff
<Sundaysmile> was gleefully expecting a fluttershy ep
<RainbowJack> next week new epi
<ofna01> Kwak
<Wrek> 05putting your hoof down
<Wrek> 05could be poor fluttershy goign assertive again
<RaveBrony> Where do you all get this money!? :'(
<Iwubponiez> fluttershy yay
<Wrek> 05anyways
<Wrek> 05dinner
<KwakLad> ofna01?
<RainbowJack> thats going to be a fluttershy one i just know it
<ofna01> it was only 15 bucks apiece.....
<Radu> See you later, Wrek
<RaveBrony> Enjoy, Wrek!
<Sundaysmile> so what will be streamed on sat instead? the re-run or something else?
<CountDoofus> ttfn wrek
<Krakass> Bye Wrek
<Iwubponiez> it is -.-
<Sundaysmile> I'd go through pony withdrawl
<Radu> Dat angle and fitting music
<PartyCannon> Wrek laters
<derpy_pony> only 8 more episodes in this season
<Sundaysmile> yay
<derpy_pony> bye wrek
<RaveBrony> o_o
<Sundaysmile> and then season 3 in nine months afterwards
<derpy_pony> what will we do in summer?
<Radu> Rewatch ALL the episodes?
<PartyCannon> derpy_pony the same thing we did last summer
<PartyCannon> going on a fanwork binge
<Sundaysmile> visit ponycon?
<Krakass> But how can seaon 3's intro beat season 2?
<Krakass> What's better than Discord?
<derpy_pony> by taking the italian version
<Radu> Disquord
<Iwubponiez> 9 months :O
<RainbowJack> krakass they will think of something
<derpy_pony> discord was not that good, imo
<Sundaysmile> maybe less wubponies
<Sundaysmile> was an exagerration
<Radu> @pony
<Radu> Boo.
<derpy_pony> more lazers
<RainbowJack> more CMC
<Krakass> Well as long as they don't get a shark and jump over it on a motorcycle.
<Iwubponiez> yay scoots episode
<Sundaysmile> well that Twilight from the future ep might be a sign of things to come?
<RainbowJack> maybe next season they will get the marks "finaly"
<derpy_pony> scoot will never get an episode
<Radu> I want an ep in season 3 in which the CMC get their cutie marks.
<derpy_pony> she is the milhouse of mlp ^^
<Iwubponiez> derpy_pony NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Sundaysmile> I think if anything they will get their marks in a feature length movie
<Iwubponiez> she is my fav CMC
<Sundaysmile> ANd yes, I'm one of the ones who thinks that'll happen
<Radu> Spike is best CMC
<derpy_pony> I fear this movie
<Iwubponiez> spike? CMC? seems legit
<derpy_pony> it will be horrible and childish
<Sundaysmile> likewise... usually movies of tv shows tend to tie up loose ends
<derpy_pony> probably
<Sundaysmile> and abruptly
<derpy_pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TtGQnyPZ6g
<Radu> derpy, not really, since Hasbro is now aware of bronies.
<PartyCannon> We can neither confirm nor deny that FiM is only 3 seasons long at this time
<Jim> I really hope for a full length theatre only mlp movie soon. Imagine all them bronies
<Sundaysmile> so reminds me of kryton
<Radu> Sadly, I don't think FiM will get more than 5-6 seasons
<Sundaysmile> that would be glorious radu
<derpy_pony> the fanservice doesn't make it better...hasbro might try to pander the loudest voices on sites like ponychan...not sure if I want that
<ScootaChicken_> Hey BronyState :3
<RainbowJack> radu dont say that kind of silly stuff
<Radu> I demand 9000 seasons.
<PartyCannon> Radu it would be good enough IMO; I hate shows that drag on forever
<Radu> Hi ScootaChicken
<Jim> ohai ScootaChicken_
<ScootaChicken_> Y'know, My Little Pony has been going for about 30 years.
<ScootaChicken_> just pointing that out.
<Paradise92> Hello all...
<Jim> ohai Paradise92
<alexxm> hey ScootaChicken
<RainbowJack> agree on that partyCannon like Naruto Bleach and one piece
<mario_pony> no stream?
<Paradise92> The creepy images can start mwuhahahaha
<Radu> Conspiracy Keanu: What if they're gonna start a G5 that's gonna be even worse than G3.5?
<alexxm> hey Paradise92
<Jim> mario_pony: Wrek is out for a while, he will maybe come back to stream later
<derpy_pony> fim is running good, keeping it, even at lower budget, is better than trying g5 with completely new staff and concepts
<CCCP> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1330018396426.png
<mario_pony> oh okay just checking
<Sundaysmile> didn't one of the voice actors already confirm they were hired for season 3?

<Fazana> Nothing happened basically
<RaveBrony> Krakass, did you draw that??
<ofna01> Faz
<mario_pony> i don't get nascar
<Fazana> To be frank, a wasted of a few hours
<Wrek> 05i love shadowsquirrels work
<ofna01> who's your favorite driver
<Wrek> 05he's so awesome :D
<Sundaysmile> mario it's a race
<CountDoofus> They're making a left turn!
<Fazana> I dunno
<ofna01> 24 for me
<Fazana> There's quite a few
<Krakass> RaveBrony, does that look anything like a stick figure?
<Fazana> I'd say Juan Pablo Montoya
<RaveBrony> Rofl :D
<Krakass> If not, then no I didn't draw it.
<ofna01> poor jeff got crashed out last race,he would've probably won
<Fazana> But I also like Dale Earnhardt Jr
<RaveBrony> Im totally drawing those eyes....omg :o
<Fazana> Jeff Gordon
<Dark_Horst> oh hey, itÄs back
<ofna01> yeah
<Fazana> Yeah, thatkinda scared me
<Radu> Stream is back up? Just wondering
<Wrek> 05so
<Fazana> I'm kinda new to Nascar
<derpy_pony> which band is this?
<Wrek> 05time to draw sexie eyes, cute eyes or anything?
<ofna01> i still remember Dale Earnhardt Sr
<CountDoofus> Radu: yes it is
<Radu> Yes it is, gladly no refresh needed :)
<ofna01> ummm
<Fazana> Been an F1 fan for about 10 years.
<mario_pony> what is the point to nascar?
<Krakass> Sexy eyes with firearms?
<Shizuka> 13vector und color~
<Jim> sexie cute anythings please
<RaveBrony> Yes!! Very Detaled eyes please, Wrek :)
<Paradise92> Sexie eyes!
<Krakass> Always a safe combo
<Fazana> Yeah, I remember the news on DE Sr
<ofna01> i was watching the race
<Fazana> I was 4 then, so I probably wouldn't have the patience to watch ovals
<ofna01> your the same age as me
<RaveBrony> Oh man....now my older bro is blaring Nascar on his tv...fuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<ofna01> O_O
<Dark_Horst> i spy an eye
<Radu> I remember when I was 6, and I was watching Formula 1 with Dad eating sweetcorn <3
<Fazana> Oh, and Mario, Nascar is speed and consistency
<Sundaysmile> Rave Brony, just blare the MLP intro
<Sundaysmile> MAX VOLUME
<Fazana> I wish I was born earlier
<pony_454> anyone here play Hatoful Boyfriend?
<ofna01> MAXIMUUUM TROOOLLLIIIING
<Fazana> Then I could watch Senna kick arse
<RaveBrony> I shall!!! :$
<Radu> Eye see you.
<mario_pony> how come there are soo many people on here but only a few actually get in on the conversation?
<ofna01> NAscar vs MLP
<Sundaysmile> i used to wonder what nascar could be
<Krakass> RD would win.
<mario_pony> mlp
<ofna01> i have no clue....
<Sundaysmile> until you shared it's magic with me
<Fazana> RD in a nascar
<ofna01> RD+Nascar= 20% cooler
<Fazana> Replace that ass of a driver Kyle Busch
<Radu> RD will have no effect in Nascar, since it's involved car driving.
<MirrorImage> oh, are there actually some people here watching the Duels?
<Dark_Horst> is it paced faster? than the studio version?
<ofna01> me Mirror
<Radu> I'd love to see RD in the Olympics
<Krakass> I need to win the lottery so I can sponsor a car
<Shizuka> 13quidditch: it's like the WNBA divided by curling
<Krakass> Huge RD logo down the side.
<Fazana> I would Sponser McLaren
<Shizuka> 13quidditch! what your wife sees when you make her watch baseball!
<ofna01> mirror who are you going for?
<MirrorImage> Jeff Gordon
<ofna01> :DDD
<MirrorImage> failing that, Hendrick
<ofna01> me too!
<Shizuka> 13quidditch! there's actually videos of people trying to play it on youtube!
<Fazana> I would sponser Montoya
<Fazana> with "Shout today!"
<Fazana> It would match him perfectly
<Radu> Quick. Guess the pony.
<ofna01> its a pony
<Radu> I say Rarity
<ofna01> umm
<ofna01> no.....
<ofna01> not pinkie
<Sundaysmile> Quiddich: When you watch inmates try to catch a snitch
<CCCP> Trixie
<Radu> I say OC
<Iwubponiez> fluttershy :P
<Fazana> If you ever watched Montoya in F1, "Bucking Raikkonnen, what a bucking idiot!"

<ofna01> RainbowJack
<Shizuka> 13HE'S MAKING ANOTHER LEFT TURN

<Paradise92> Shizuka then why didn't he got a warning?
<AwsomeNick> Same but then i took freindship to the knee
<Shizuka> 13You worry about yourself.
<Paradise92> Shizuka that wasn't a PG13 thing

<Cypresswolf> How old is flash animation? to my knowledge its somewhere under 10 years
<Iwubponiez> eeyup
<Jim> Coolbluemidnite: I'm OK with that
<Coolbluemidnite> xD
<Radu> Goodbye everyone, good luck Wrek on the drawing c:
<Fazana> It's a little over 10 years
<RaveBrony> Indeed, Wrek :)
<Coolbluemidnite> Byee radu
<unfoundbug|nap> Coolbluemidnite i dont think anyone would complain at that
<Fazana> I know this because Badger badger badger was done in Flash
<Fazana> In 2001
<Jim> bye Radu
<Capn_fisty> Coolbluemidnite: wouldnt WE have to break the 4th wall for that.
<Coolbluemidnite> Yesh and then we would all take turns hugging fluttershy ^_^
<Coolbluemidnite> Good point.....
<Everlasting_Joy> :)
<RaveBrony> Cya Radu
<Iwubponiez> nah i'll just call pinkie but i need a phone first XD
<Fazana> I break the 4th wall on a daily basis
<Coolbluemidnite> xD
*Iwubponiez brings her cell
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm hittin' the cider bar with pinkie
<RaveBrony> ^lol
<Fazana> It cuts off about a 30 minutes off my school journey
<Coolbluemidnite> If you went to equestria what would the 1st thing you would do there?
<Paradise92> well i'll be off guys gonna play some LoL
<Iwubponiez> make friends!!
<Dashie_Dashie> run naked through ponyville drunk.
<Coolbluemidnite> XD
<Fazana> I would go and find Rarity, and try live with her :3
<Capn_fisty> Depends if you turn pony or not when you get there
<Dashie_Dashie> just kidding.
<Dashie_Dashie> xD
<Fazana> I would most likely succeed because one is quite high class
<Coolbluemidnite> I'd be a black and white pony with poofy black hair :3
<stallion1> I just wanted to say that you guys are awesome
<Dashie_Dashie> I'd actually run naked trough ponyville while this song was playing.
<RaveBrony> I dont know what i wud do in equestria :D
<Fazana> Dashie, I would rather play Benny Hill if you did that
<RaveBrony> Maybe, rave with Vinyl Scratch? :)
<Capn_fisty> If do turn pony, spend ages finding out how 4 legs walking works
<Coolbluemidnite> I'd go to pinkie pie and listen to her sing random songs
<Everlasting_Joy> Thank you stallion1, if you're refering to the audience of course.
<RaveBrony> ^
<Sundaysmile> Gotta trot before you can gallop
<Coolbluemidnite> X3
<stallion1> yea
<Capn_fisty> then run around in circles like a derp trying to fiond out what my cutie mark is
<Dashie_Dashie> for real though, I'd HUG ALL THINGS.
<Fazana> I'll just get my car and make ponies jelly
<RaveBrony> Pshh, id be on 2 legs the whole time :D
<Fazana> Take Rarity for a ride
<RaveBrony> trying to keep my balance...
<Dashie_Dashie> rainbow dash can beat any car
<Dashie_Dashie> lolwut
<Coolbluemidnite> I'd take over princess celestia and be ruler of equestria
<Jim> If I was a pony, I'd wish to be a pegasus
<Fazana> My car goes about 80 MPH :3
<Coolbluemidnite> i'd wish to be a alicorn
<Dashie_Dashie> she's banish you to the walk within the fourth wall
<Coolbluemidnite> or to the moon
<Dashie_Dashie> you'd be stuck between rifts
<Dashie_Dashie> wall*
<Everlasting_Joy> Dashie_Dashie That's an awful fate.
<Fazana> If Dashie could beat my car, I could probably beat her in a flying comp though
<Dashie_Dashie> Don't try to overthrow celestia xD
<Dashie_Dashie> shes best dictator
<Coolbluemidnite> XD i wont lol
<Dashie_Dashie> I mean... princess
<Fazana> I fly at around 1200 MPH
<Coolbluemidnite> Nah i'd go to the cake store and pig out those cakes look good

<PinkieCupcake> Yay! I'm not the only pegasister!
<Coolbluemidnite> Maybe :o im ok at copying stuff
<Dashie_Dashie> I wish I still had my guitar, I loved playing tunes like these.
<Coolbluemidnite> -highfive- :D
<Meanwhile> Fine, with a hint of headache.
<Everlasting_Joy> Pegasister16 I'm doing pretty well. Working on show notes at the moment.
<Iwubponiez> highhoof
<Coolbluemidnite> ^_^
<Meanwhile> So are we moving away from Brony being a neutral term?
<Bronyzilla> Huh?
<KwakLad> What do you mean Meanwhile ?
<PinkieCupcake> ?
<Sumica> 00,10for some resion I read that as fine with a hint of headcrab.
<Krakass> Woohoo, I'm not the only brony here.
<Coolbluemidnite> idk i always thought pegasister was girl and brony was boy
<Jim> I guess some people prefer to use pegasister others just say brony
<Dashie_Dashie> What Sumica said.
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile that's a gray area to be honest.
<Meanwhile> Sumica, hostiles inbound.
<CountDoofus> I like the "Art of War" TF2 music
<Tovler> Girls can call themselves whatever they want to call themselves.
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<PinkieCupcake> No, pegasister is the female term for brony
<Bronyzilla> Yeah.
<RaveBrony> Ha! Im back! :)
<CountDoofus> but many pegasisters hate that term
<Meanwhile> I always thought pegasister sounded a bit weird.
<RaveBrony> :o
<Jim> Welcome back RaveBrony
<Wrek> 05maybe it is
<Bronyzilla> Otherwise girls will be 'bros'. Awkward.
<RaveBrony> Thanks :P
<Sumica> 00,10Still not a fan of the pegasisisisisister term.
<Coolbluemidnite> Im a fan of my little pony thats all i know
<Wrek> 05but a majority consider brony an unisex term
<CrazyBronyDonut> my friends who are girls go by either
<Wrek> 05and the majority is always right
<Meanwhile> Lolnope.
<Dashie_Dashie> Sumica.exe is not responding.
<Coolbluemidnite> Yea i'll just go by either
<Coolbluemidnite> lol
<PinkieCupcake> but I still prefer brony imo
<RaveBrony> I agree with Wrek, but i didnt think of it that way
<Pegasister16> So I've been thinking about doing a voice audition for Mane6.
<Meanwhile> Personally yeah I think brony is unisex.
<Jaegerpony> nods
*Pegasister16 agrees
<Coolbluemidnite> I wanna do a rarity one but i know this would sound weird i sound kinda good as a male rarity o.o
<Sumica> 00,10may the farce be with you Pegasister16
<Tovler> we'd better conform to the whims of the "many" then. Pegasister, ftw (that was needlessly combative)
<CrazyBronyDonut> the original term is /b/rony
<Jim> which pony are you thinking Pegasister16 ?
<RaveBrony> Meh, i didnt think of it as unisex, but yeah, its understandable :P
<Bronyzilla> Pegasis or Brony, I don't pay much attention to gender tbh.
<Pegasister16> Fluttershy and Applebloom
<Jim> I hear TF2
<PinkieCupcake> Pegasister just sounds..weird and I'm a girl
<Meanwhile> Bronyzilla: one day that's going to come back to bite you in the flank...
<Sumica> 00,10dat tf2 waltz
<Iwubponiez> pinkie eeyup
<Coolbluemidnite> TF2

<emangamer> Ohai Meanwhile
<Dashie_Dashie> Let's all play TF2 again.
<Dashie_Dashie> :>
<CountDoofus> Wrek, got "The Art of War"?
<RaveBrony> I downloaded TF2! But...i suck at it :D
<PinkieCupcake> I suck at TF2 :(
<Dashie_Dashie> I headshotted wrek yesterday
<Meanwhile> TF2 last night was good fun. 'Till Wrek went idle and the server shut down. :P
<Dashie_Dashie> FINALLY.
<Pegasister16> Jim- I'm planning to do Fluttershy and Applebloom
<Sumica> 00,10I suddnly want to see wreks take on the mane6 in tf2 loadouts.
<Tovler> I prefer "fan of My Little Pony"
<RaveBrony> o.o
<PinkieCupcake> ?
<Meanwhile> Brony is easier to say than that.
<Pegasister16> ^
<Coolbluemidnite> Im a brony or a pegasister im not bothered wich
<Jim> TF2 is so much fun to play with other bronies
<PinkieCupcake> Brony is so much better
<Iwubponiez> tovler too long
<Jaegerpony> wants this picture
<Iwubponiez> i dnt really care what i am called i just like MLP
<CrazyBronyDonut> i love minecraft with fellow bronies
<Coolbluemidnite> -has never played tf2 in my life- some of my friends was saying it was crap =/
<Meanwhile> You need better friends.
<Coolbluemidnite> xD
<CountDoofus> :D
<Jim> Coolbluemidnite: It's quite cool if you play it with cool people
<Jaegerpony> anything is good if you put ponies in it
<Iwubponiez> :d
<CountDoofus> thanks Wrek :)
<Sumica> 00,10I was not much of a fan of tf2 unless I was playing with friends.
<PinkieCupcake> I never played TF2 but I heard it was a lot of fun
<CrazyBronyDonut> TF2 is really only a PC thing so console players dont really get it
<Sumica> 00,10I have a blast playing with all of you.
<Coolbluemidnite> i guess im scaredd of going on it cus people will look at me like >.> wth when i have no idea what im doing
<ThatsAShinySky> Hey guys Im back! Shame you can't play tf2 on ur phone
<Dashie_Dashie> We wub you Sumica /)^3^(\
<Sumica> 00,10especaly that melee map
<Krakass> When Wrek is done drawing he should start the server up.
<Meanwhile> No doubt, TF2 on a console is a strange paradox of itself.
<Dashie_Dashie> Degroot
<DaringDude> i just got itt yesterday but wrek brought the server down b4 it loaded :(
<Coolbluemidnite> xD
<PinkieCupcake> aww

<Saigneur> :);):)
<Zappy> Hello Greed!
*otakon remembers her original outfit of overalls and a black strip of cloth around her chest....
<RAWRity> Winry Rockbell: She wears skirts as belts and belts as shirts.
*LadyCanary giggles.
<September> Suddenly TrollGreed appears!
<emangamer> Ohai RAWRity
<RAWRity> emangamer: ohai? I been her like an hour.
<Waffles> is the little girl still in there?
<MirrorImage> dem Smile remixes
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Well at least she's not wearing belts as a dress, like Lulu from FFX
<RAWRity> *here
<Meanwhile> Greedo dah.
<otakon> he's Greedo?
<Sumica> 00,10greedoda
<emangamer> RAWRity: well I've zoned in and out
<otakon> does that mean he'd shoot first?
<unfoundbug> the ponybeat mix is pretty good
<MirrorImage> wait, ponybeat is in there?
<MirrorImage> as in Odyssey Eurobeat?
<unfoundbug> yes
<Paradise92> prince-dari a bot?
<otakon> it's Marcoh!
<unfoundbug> he released a new song earlier today
<otakon> Paradise92: eeyup
<unfoundbug> instrumental but nice background music
<LadyCanary> Hi MirrorImage! Didnt see you there!
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: no now, Lulu had a dress that covered most of her body. It's just that her breasts were so enormous that clothing just could not contain them.
<Sumica> 00,10cyborg Paradise92
<Meanwhile> prince-dari isn't always a bot. just when he isn't around.
<September> I personally like Love Me Cheerilee and Discord by LivingTombstone & EuroBeat
<Paradise92> Sumica Terminator Lary?
<otakon> RAWRity: oh yh, I remember that
<KwakLad> Paradise92: sort of, sometimes (seemingly rarely) is about and speaks
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> guy in the sewer tell you he is a doctor
<Saigneur> :D
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> seems legit
<otakon> and then Marcoh lost it
<flutter_spin> http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2010/6/14/129210157191556358.jpg
<September> Random guy in the sewer says he's a doctor. Smeems Legit.
<Saigneur> dat cat
<September> TheGreatAndPowerfulT I think he lost it forever ago.
<RAWRity> Really, if anybody had the most shameless outfit, it was Riku in FFX-2
<Paradise92> September want me to PM you a dirtie version of Love me Cherrile?
<KwakLad> Its friday!
<September> Paradise92 Sure why not.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> September: yep
<Paradise92> dat link is awesome
<otakon> RAWRity: but Rikku is HOT.
<Theoboldi> FRIDAY NIGHT
<Cypresswolf> nothing wrong with the floor :P
<unfoundbug> ffx-2 was pretty poor in comparison to ffx
<otakon> so what's it say?
<RAWRity> otakon: and 15.
<KwakLad> Theo friday morning :p
<otakon> unfoundbug: agreed
<CriticKitten> ....Rikku is underage, dude!
<Meanwhile> And then otakon was a perv.
<unfoundbug> hang on...
<unfoundbug> wtf
<unfoundbug> that smile remix
<emangamer> otakon: ...wow
<Theoboldi> Don't use your fancy mathematics to muddy the issue!
<unfoundbug> those songs
<unfoundbug> should never be mixed
<flutter_spin> I google that guy and I get images 40% Hitler and 40% Obama. Why google?
<RAWRity> though really, if anybody's a perve, it's the game makers who had Rikky wearing a miniskirt, bikini top, and visible thong. AT FIFTEEN.
<RAWRity> *pervert
<unfoundbug> but its... pretty good
<RAWRity> *rikku
<Shadowpony0071> what anim is this?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dat face
<Saigneur> 1AM X_x i have to go to bed, sorry luna, bye everypony :)
<Meanwhile> Bye Saigneur
<Shadowpony0071> for me its 6:04 pm
<unfoundbug> yeahx3 is so much better with pinkie singing
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night Saigneur
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: That's standard FF faire, though
<RAWRity> Shadowpony0071: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
<Zappy> Bye Saigneur, may you dream of ponies!
<Waffles> 6_9
<emangamer> bye Saigneur
<Shadowpony0071> oh

<Theoboldi> bye to ya
<Sumica> 00,10manly tears
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> armstrong is best manly man
<September> Armstrong crying?!
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: at lest they usually try to cover a LITTLE more than that. Plus that scene in x-2 where she compares breast sizes with Yuna....
<September> Lies.
<LadyCanary> D: Awww.
<Zappy> Man tears!
<Meanwhile> What's wrong with his hair?
<Saigneur> Shadowpony0071 6PM <3 lucker ^^
<flutter_spin> that is some intense emotions going on there
<CriticKitten> X-2 can go burn
<otakon> indeed
<Paradise92> Sumica...i found a fanfic...involving FMA and MLP :)
<otakon> Armstrong is stronger now, he will NEVER forget
<RAWRity> x-2 has one thing going for it: It doesn't have fucking Tidus
<CriticKitten> FFX was at least salvageable if you removed about half its character roster. I actually enjoyed it, sort of.
<otakon> also, brb guys
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Armstrong pony where is it ?
<Theoboldi> Meanwhile his hair reminds me of some comic, though I can't remember the name
<otakon> RAWRity: I acutally like Tidus as a character, gameplay and story wise tbh
<flutter_spin> good o' Lust
<otakon> brb
<PinkiePieCopy> MLA
<RAWRity> otakon: you got issues then.
<unfoundbug> repeat post????
<RAWRity> Tidus can eat ALL the ass.
*LadyCanary giggles.
<September> Jesus christ what did I miss? where did her ARM go?!!
<Meanwhile> ...ok then.
<flutter_spin> FFX was my first Final Fantasy. I will not deny its faults, but I did like Yuna... as a character *cough*
<Midnight_Blaze> night all.
<Cobalt> NEEDS MORE PONIES<
<Sumica> 00,10she cut it off and tied it to a dog to loose the guy that was chaceing her.
<RAWRity> September: She cut it off to get away from the Homonculi that was chasing her.
<Dashie_Dashie|Lolwut> Final Fantasy 7 > all.
<Theoboldi> You know what I#m talking about.
<PinkiePieCopy> There is over 100 Final Fantasies in the future.
<RaveBrony> Firefox craches for the 6th time today?
<LadyCanary> Pandy <3 <3
*RaveBrony is not amused
<Theoboldi> *?

<Meanwhile> Binned.
<Sumica> 00,10I need to make that an image with that face of his RAWRity
<September> He just DECIDES to keep drinking.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: he sure as hell doesn't want to.
<CriticKitten> ....would you want to?
<CriticKitten> :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> because he can drink it~
<September> Is it wrong I thought of Rawrity's comment in RageComic form?
<PinkiePieCopy> Ugguh.
<flutter_spin> O.o
<flutter_spin> Useless peasants
<September> 23 Hours until I piss away a few hours of my life derpin around on BronyState. :D
<Kipkat07> How long does a brony need to be a brony till he is considered by the brony community as a full true brony?
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/afxiG.png
<flutter_spin> Watched every episode at least once.
<September> When he/she is able to recite the entire theme by heart/
<flutter_spin> Oh and had 1 dream about ponies
<PinkiePieCopy> You will never get a decents night sleep. BITCH.
<Kipkat07> okay then im a brony
<Meanwhile> I used to wonder what friendship could be~
<RAWRity> When he or she can sing Art of the Dress without missing a beat.
<Dashie_Dashie> I piss away hours on bronystate everyday.
<ekips> as soon as you are in the state of liking the series, you are a brony
*PinkiePieCopy is punched in face by Bronystatee
<Dashie_Dashie> I'mokwiththis
<PinkiePieCopy> NOPE.
<RAWRity> Keep that gun ed! you'll need it!
<Wrek> 05really enjoyign this show

<CriticKitten> It's dangerous to go alone. Take this gun!

<Waffles>
<SuperBrony64> 10,02emangamer: Dat wub...
<RAWRity> Wrek: glad to hear! It's got some issues, but overall it's a very good show.
<Dashie_Dashie> ?*
<Waffles>
*PinkiePieCopy obtained a scout!
<Kipkat07> panda!!
<Meanwhile> I bet panda's taste awesome.
<Wrek> 05i was told by almost everyone that the brotherhood part of it was useless
<DaringDude> has this stream ever done a mlp from start to the newest episode?
<flutter_spin> I say you do 1) Proudly say you are a brony 2) Visit EQD 3) Visit Bronystate
*Sumica wonders if SB has ping for wub.
<September> When are Ed and Winry gonna stop beating around the bush and make out already.
<Wrek> 05but i cant see anythign wrong, entertainment is entertainment
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Dat wub ping
<CriticKitten> The issues are pretty minor, though, honestly. This is probably one of the better anime out there by a good margin.
<LadyCanary> Wreky!
<Shadowpony0071> 2_2 first time ive watched this anime
<PinkiePieCopy> Oh my gosh, how much strength love can bring me. PART OF THE BRONY MOTTO
<Capn_fisty> I dont have enough room on the side of my computer that faces me to put my rarispike sticker from welovefine :(
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Actually I don't .___.

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Cause sometimes the wub isn't actually for me ;____;
<Dashie_Dashie> ?*
<CriticKitten> Wrek: Really? Wow, that's surprising. Brotherhood's the BEST part of FMA honestly.
<Dashie_Dashie> xD

<Meanwhile> SuperBrony64: this wub is for you <3

<CriticKitten> September: Different character
<September> Ok.
<CriticKitten> You'll meet him later in the show.
<Wrek> 05i dunno
<CriticKitten> He's a badass too.
*PinkiePieCopy glomps Meanwhike
<Wrek> 05kinda urging to draw tf2 ponis
<RaveBrony> I agree with Dashie_Dashie! Alch pony!
*PinkiePieCopy Glomps Meanwhile
<KwakLad> lol if only 2 people could stream at once.... i think im too tired to pay attention to drawing :/ Sorry Wrek :p
<CriticKitten> ....in fact most of the cast of FMA:B has ranks in badassery
*Meanwhile is glomped by a low flying PinkiePieCopy.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Draw Team Bronystate Wrek~!
<CriticKitten> It's like a requirement
<Meanwhile> I didn't ask for this...
<Sumica> 00,10I would love to see you draw tf2 ponies.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Sumica: Dat 64 ping
<CriticKitten> "You must be at least this badass to be on this show"
<PinkiePieCopy> Glomp means a hug tight asheck
<Wrek> 05anyways back to fma, back in the outro/intro
<PinkiePieCopy> Wrek already did, Pony Fortress
<flutter_spin> This coming from the guy who shot flames out of his hands at a woman...
<Sumica> 00,10well he did generic ponies yes.
<RaveBrony> Some needs to teach me how to be good at TF2
<PinkiePieCopy> He enforces Kill It With Fire
<Sumica> 00,10I meent mane6 and co
<CriticKitten> Dat coughing of blood
<PinkiePieCopy> I can teah you RaveBrony
<RaveBrony> :o
<otakon> oh look
<RaveBrony> Are we able to go into a private game so you can show me?
<Meanwhile> The key to TF2 is knowing how your class is best used to support the team.
<RaveBrony> I just get killed by turrets....in practice...
<flutter_spin> I wonder how old these guys are
<otakon> Riza b4 she took her level in badass
<Meanwhile> And to make sure everyone doesn't go sniper -_-
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile: or spy
<PinkiePieCopy> No, the key to TF2 is spending 1 year away from it and come back to find you killing everybody
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<PinkiePieCopy> Like I did
<Sumica> 00,10botmatches are a good way to learn the ropes then refine with layers
<unfoundbug> Meanwhile, also being willing to change to whatever class is needed at the time
<Meanwhile> PinkiePieCopy: like riding a bike.
<CupcakeWarrior> Awww, why no english voices?
<PinkiePieCopy> Yup.
<CupcakeWarrior> Also, hi
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and don't go all alone after all it is Team Fortress
<PinkiePieCopy> =yay= english voicees. We have subtitles.
<RAWRity> oh wait! Pride's gonna show up soon, awesome!
<flutter_spin> The same reason why we don't listen to MLP in other languages
<RaveBrony> When my kd spread is like 0:28....28 being death...bots dont help :'(
<Sumica> 00,10I left tf2 for over a year and came back to all my stuff being called vintage.
<CupcakeWarrior> News flash: english>japanese
<Meanwhile> WRONG.
<Tovler|SuicideWatch> well, that was a bad movie.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica: same thing
*Meanwhile hits CupcakeWarrior with a cinderblock.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well more like six months~
<PinkiePieCopy> I left TF2 for a year to find all my opponents exploded or on fire
<CupcakeWarrior> Whats so bad about dubs?
<Theoboldi> Nein Deutsch ist besser!
<unfoundbug> Sumica, and yet still plenty useful to kill everyone
<RaveBrony> How ong has TF2 been around?? O.O
<RaveBrony> *long
<Meanwhile> Actually I've never heard this dubbed. But in my experience dubs of anything suck.
<Sumica> 00,10indeed
<Shadowpony0071> LOL
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> 2007 right ?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i think
<Meanwhile> RaveBrony: like, 5 years.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i don't remember
<Theoboldi> Death Note had a pretty good dub.
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: then you must not have many experiences with modern dubs.
<RaveBrony> Woah!!! THen im SUPER late to the party O_o
<unfoundbug> im always so supprised at how much they keep adding yet it never feels too unbalanced
<ekips> Theoboldi the german dub is horrible
<Sumica> 00,10I rather like my "direct hit" rocket launcher.
<Shadowpony0071> :D
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: When you find something to suck you generally don't check up on thigns like it at a later date.
<unfoundbug> iv run on that since i got it a couple years back
<RaveBrony> Who is the best person to use in TF2??
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> BTW someone have a strange medigun ?
<Meanwhile> Which is why I don't care about Final Fantasy or console gaming.
<Theoboldi> I watched the english one. I think I'll take a quick look at teh german one later.
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: you mean like with Ponies?
<CriticKitten> And now you learn how awful this war really was. >_>
<CupcakeWarrior> I wont even watch an anime if it doesnt have a dub
<Saturn> 08,01i hate this essay
<Saturn> 08,01it can go make cheese.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RaveBrony: depends on what you like and how you play~
<unfoundbug> RaveBrony there isnt ont
<RaveBrony> Hows it coming along Saturn?
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: My only prior experience with ponies was Rescue from Midnight Castle.
<unfoundbug> one*
<unfoundbug> every class has strengths and weaknesses
<RaveBrony> Well ive played 3 characters and i suck at all of them...
<CupcakeWarrior> What episode is this?
<unfoundbug> RaveBrony, practice
<Meanwhile> RaveBrony: find your niche.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> start with engie or pyro
<unfoundbug> and changing to what is needed generally helps
<Meanwhile> Start with engi? Pfft.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you will learn to aim
<mario_pony> we are the cutie mark crusader!
<unfoundbug> pyro is a good call
<Theoboldi> Engie? Starting? Are you kidding me?
<Meanwhile> Pyro is too close range.
<PinkiePieCopy> Start with the Pyro.
<Sumica> 00,10piro is a blast on payload especaly with the back burrner ^_^
<Meanwhile> Start with soldier.
<unfoundbug> run at enemy, burn enemy, kill enemy
<RaveBrony> Skinny guy? dies in one hit.... Rocket launcher guy? gets burned to death.. Healer? Cant do sheeeyut :'(
<Tovler> Well, I give Breaking Dawn a 1/10. Its manner offends.
<PinkiePieCopy> I have the back burner, and on payload I won
<Capn_fisty> ugh the back burner
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i did star with engie just because, the sentry distracted everyone while i shoot them
<September> lol I can't focus with Ed's face. "What the hell?!" look on his face/
<Zappy> *yawns* Time for me to finish my homework. Goodnight everypony.
<Meanwhile> Soldier at least has ranged potential.
<Capn_fisty> cheap ass weapon
<CupcakeWarrior> Tovler: a 1 is too high
<unfoundbug> rave, all of them are necessary
