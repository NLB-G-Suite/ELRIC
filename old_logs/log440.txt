<WallDives> Kid_Cobalt: even liquor sounds like CPU shenanigans.
<Viri> 14*:3
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01WallDives: it's called a kernel panic because it's smooth until you get to the bomb, and the combination of a trippel and those shots will make you core dump

<Viri> 14on a different topic
<Cypresswolf> what game is this?
*Pony brb
<Jim> Cypresswolf: Saw

<Cypresswolf> Nice!
<Viri> 14why I love how death metal sounds, but I hate the voice that singers have?

<Mozdoc> Okay, so for those of us who know nothing about said game, what's the premise/plot/whatever of it?
*HyperMetalLugia finds some nails and scratches them against a chalkboard
<Om> That floor is as smooth as glass.
<LunaTheBeloved> Screw it I will

<PONY> the order was changed I suppose, Pi is last?
<RDashie> OK BYE GURLS
<Airpuff> Bai then PonySwagg =P
<Om> GilDash: But that isn't your style? You might end up finding me vapid.
<Monfang> Or do you mean mindfucks? In which case I want to relax today and dont' really want any of that.
<Dken2021> there, might get better response time, then again, idk
<Airpuff> Bye RDashie
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: is the static apart of the movie?
<PrincessLuna> More like a shower
<PrincessLuna> Or vacuum?
<TheMaster> i've seen the wall a few times. i've listened to the album atleast 800 times
<LordDerpington> Bizarrely, despite this being one of my favourite albums, I've never seen the movie.

<Monfang> A movie should grab the audience the moment it starts, Otakon
<Vordox> It's Maid Hour already? O.o
<PONY> seems legit
<GilDash> Om: I that's what you want, Ommy...
<SlurryMoon> 3this is The Wall, yeah?

<PONY> HALT! Hammerzeit
<Viri> 14music was boring for me, until a few years ago
<Cypresswolf> I like those old style lanterns
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because I do hear a background hiss.
<Viri> 14don't ask me why o.o
*PrincessLuna hugs MaidSurge
<BronyJenkins> Awesome.

<PrincessLuna> Ohh
<Kid_Cobalt> I love the sound of bombs in the morning...it sounds like....victory..
<Acleps> I'm going to bet that this movie will have music from Ponk Floyd.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Shizuka good morning.
<Monfang> Those are soviat rockets.
<Monfang> Not bombs
<SilverSonic|Android> ive got a 35 minute song

<LunaTheBeloved> Yeah, I like this
<yifle1> see ya all later
<PONY> Silly soundtrack
<Monfang> But those didn't sound like bombs. They sounded like soviet rockets.
<GilDash> Airpuff: That's because it wasn't me. ;)
<Kid_Cobalt> Magnum >=3
<SilverSonic|Android> Someone made a 25 minute metroid guitar mix
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maid Hour is starting to get out of hand TBH.
<TheMaster> this is sort of like a biography of roger waters...with acid
<Rain> aww, Im sorry to hear that, Shizu
<Airpuff> GilDash: See what you did there...
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: why do you say that?
<PrincessLuna> Yea but it wasn't a Katyusha rocket launcher...
*Tovler|nickfail wishes you had waited until Friday or Saturday to play this movie.
<ScootaBlues> After you've done that, go to 'Auto Perform' and add join #bronystate
<SilverSonic|Android> Called Grant Henry's Flesh Crystal i think
*Airpuff kisses GilDash
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Aww, I like. :(
<ScootaBlues> and join #bronystateregulasr
<SilverSonic|Android> Its by PoD

<otakon> Shizuka: no good sleep last night?
*GilDash smooches Acleps.
<ScootaBlues> And any other channels you use here
<PrincessLuna> Monfang: Just standard artillery, no katyusha :)
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: ah
<Kandarihu> Maybe we should just have two Maid Hours. A European Maid Hour and a NA Maid Hour
<Dken2021> you've been using the lightirc on the site LTB?
<Om> GilDash: I never know what I want.
<Shizuka> 13nope, stressful dreams
<Rain> :<
<Monfang> It might have been what it was, but it didn't sound like it, Princess Luna.
*Acleps looks at GilDash with a surprised gaze
*Rain hugs Shizuka
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: That's currently set up.
<PONY> Nittany_Discord, I expected you to be more familiar with that, L&M
<LunaTheBeloved> Yeah
<TheMaster> its pink
<Viri> 14probably my >10mins favourite song is Ghost Love Score :D
<Kandarihu> Okay
<GilDash> Kandarihu: Usually that just leads to a mental European maid hour and a crap American maid hour...
<MaidSurge> Nittany_Discord: that's why I'm always a maid lately, too muc RP
<drfsupercenter> 03that song's like 9 minutes
<Monfang> Artilery and bombs make a whistling, only the Katyusha made those firework like sounds.
<otakon> Shizuka: I'm sorry to hear that dear, maybe you should try and catch a nap then?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Acleps> My ears don't like this soind
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, RP is actually discouraged.
<otakon> Acleps: it's the movie
<ScootaBlues> Oh
<Kid_Cobalt> What is he suffering PDS?
<GilDash> Om: Does that mean you're undecided?
<Dken2021> yea, kinda a bit limited on it's own
<PrincessLuna> Monfang: I <3 the sound of them
*GilDash winks at Airpuff.

<MaidSurge> Hey Pink
<Litwick> what is this movie about?
<Viri> 14from End of an Era
<Acleps> ortakon: My ears still dissaprove the sounds
<otakon> Litwick: also, no idea
<Mozdoc> She needs to say "Housekeeping".
<TheMaster> you'll see what this movie is about in a second
<Apokalipse> Trooper. I couldn't stand the lightirc as soon as they introduced it on the site
<Kandarihu> Kid_Cobalt: I think you're thinking PTSD
<ScootaBlues> And don't put the forward slash in front of the command like you would normally
<Monfang> As do I, very strong pycological effect.
<PrincessLuna> Seems legit
<PONY> Nittany_Discord, yeah, and I supposed "Keeping it sane" is also one of the BS mottos
*Airpuff starts drooling
<TheMaster> brace for it
<TheMaster> BRACE
<Monfang> So I'm starting to loose interest again.
<PrincessLuna> BRACE FOR SHOCK!

<ScootaBlues> Yeah.

<PONY> Acleps, changed it an hour ago to avoid pings that are not meant for me
<ACS13123> magical_pablez94: Yes, cause then its for official ;)
<SilverSonic|Android> http://dwellingofduels.net/dodarchive/11-08-Recover_Month/01-PrinceOfDarkness-SM-Crystal-DoD.mp3 <-- that 25 minute song

*Nittany_Discord 11,01rocks.
<Om> GilDash: Why >.>
<LunaTheBeloved> Heheh
<LunaTheBeloved> Oh brb
<Mozdoc> Alright, this being the second song into this, I'm going to say what I think. The video has absolutely nothing to do with anything, its just some kind of a setting for the music. That's it.
<hooviet_Pony> Stuka
<PONY> Nittany_Discord, you don't dislike me, do you? :(
<TheMaster> his father fought and died at anzio.
<GilDash> Om: I like the wild side. :)
<PrincessLuna> Stuka dive bombers! <3
<Acleps> PONY: Try changing your nick to "the", you'll get pings only meant for you! </sarcasm>
<GilDash> Mozdoc: And that's a bad thing?
<SilverSonic|Android> Its a cover of a cover xD
<RX-78-SweetieBot> the right mouse button is a magic device
<PONY> Acleps, well I was "a" for a while :P
<TheMaster> 'Pink Floyd' is the main character. his father dies at anzio. He grows up to be a rock star. that is the premise of the movie
<Airpuff> GilDash: Wild side is good.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01PONY: I don't like you worshiping me.
<GilDash> Airpuff: Wild side is best side. :)
<Starflash> AAAAHHH
<Acleps> PONY: It's possible :O? I thought you have to have a longer nick than that :D
<Starflash> the wall has already started. goddammit
<Airpuff> GilDash: Indeed :P
<Acleps> It seems as if this movie is going to be awesome! :D
<GilDash> Acleps: Don't go getting any ideas. :D
<a> see?
<GilDash> a: Stop that. :D
<TheMaster> the song now should be' The Thin Ice

<Midnight_Fyre> Nittany_Discord: Can I worship you? I have a golden idol of you in my living room all set up for it
<Kandarihu> Yes. Sorry about doing that yesterday
<PrincessLuna> Too bad it's not just a war movie....bitches love war movies

<MaidSurge> PrincessLuna: it's much better than a simple war movie.
<SirGanjalf> I probably will be surfing around other sites while this playing in the bg;)

*PrincessLuna hugs otakon
<Acleps> I wish I could have the chat's background as the stream, it would make my life A LOT more easier

<Litwick> tom and jerry
<MaidSurge> Tom and Jerry!
<Apokalipse> Tom and Jerry. :D
<SirGanjalf> ^
<Midnight_Fyre> This movie is weird
<ScootaBlues> RX-78-SweetieBot: A boy called Pinkerton 'Pink' Floyd's father dies in WW2 and grows up to be a Rock Star and then things get really weird.
<Om> GilDash: I dunno, what if I do?
<Midnight_Fyre> Not bad, but weird
<TheMaster> its meant to be weird. just wait till the animated parts
<GilDash> PONY: You should pick that. :)
<Litwick> ninja'd you MiadSurge <3
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: that is putting it mildly

<Apokalipse> Also, music
<PONY> Nittany_Discord, my lottery votes go for Ironsky, the Unknown Soldier and Dead snow :P
<Viri> 14meh
<ScootaBlues> I've been voting for this film as B for god knows how long, you have no idea how much I appreciate Nittany_Discord streaming this.
<GilDash> Om: It's easy to take when I'm teasing... It's harder if I ask. :(
<SilverSonic|Android> Lolwat
<Acleps> Is this movie supposed to make sense yet?
<ScootaBlues> Now I can start voting for Life of Brian
<drfsupercenter> 03it sounds like a song from DDR
<Rain> SumerPan
<Viri> 14I hate the whole "hey look my phone is quad-core, so I'm better than you" trend
<hooviet_Pony> you need to be high
<Midnight_Fyre> I feel like I'm supposed to be high right now
<Litwick> What the fuck sudden blood? Flames?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dammit, he had his period in the pool.
<LunaTheBeloved> Back
<Starflash> Wb~
<Viri> 14it's getting worse than the actual "hey I own an iPhone so I'm better than you" one
<Silor101> XD
<TheMaster> its a very artistic movie. The main character slowly builds a wall inside of himself because his life sucks.
<alexxm> hey guys
<Dashie_Dashie> ewwwwww
<Litwick> :D
<GilDash> Acleps: It's making sense for me so far... :S
<Rain> that wasnt a period, that was an exclamation point
<Om> GilDash: I know ;) you arent the only one who can tese you know.
<PONY> Acleps, it's an artistic movie, they make sense any way you want
<TheMaster> at the moment he's little, his father died in ww2.
<hooviet_Pony> and he goes insane
<Kandarihu> I really wish Life of Brian wouldn't be shown on this stream.
<Kid_Cobalt> Acleps: He is suffering PTSD that is pretty much it -lol-
<Acleps> Nittany_Discord: Apparently men have periods now :D
<SirGanjalf> Midnight_Fyre: That might be helpful:D
<Viri> 14also wut
<ScootaBlues> Kandarihu: Why?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In this movie.
<MaidSurge> Rain: I see what you did there
<madnsdestiny> think of it as a compilation of music videos.
<GilDash> Om: ... I... Don't know what to say...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sick, isn't it?
<Litwick> Religious nutjobs is why.
<alexxm> hey guys
<Rain> lol
<ScootaBlues> Dis Brick in the Wall Part 1
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, epic song.
<hooviet_Pony> brick in the wall
*Tovler|Twibfm now pick Life of Brian for A movie.
<MaidSurge> :) this song!
<Kandarihu> It's too anti-Christian
<Midnight_Fyre> TheMaster: He needs to discover ponies
<Acleps> GilDash: Damn, I feel left out
<reddawn> this movie is a sorta biography for one of the oringinal band members that went crazy
<LordDerpington> It's not anti-Christian. It's anti-dogma.
<ScootaBlues> Kandarihu: Precisely how is it Anti-Christian?
<TheMaster> This is who pinkie pie would be if she were a guy...british and also a rock star
<Insert_cupcake> life of brian isnt anti christian
<Om> GilDash: I may not be good at argueing, but I can plan ahead.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: I know.
<Yokupony> Evening everypony
<Silvespeon> whee
<madnsdestiny> I'm %100 antireligion
<GilDash> Oh godesses, this is the only song I know by them (SORRY!) but I love it soo much...
<SirGanjalf> Souds like the first notes for Proper Education
<Airpuff> GilDash: There's no telling wether or not Om is teasing you on your teases.. xD
<Acleps> PONY: I really don't like artistic movies... They make alot of them at my school, and I always suffer while watching them
<Silvespeon> on logmein
<Dashie_Dashie> HEY! TEACHER, LEAVE THOSE KIDS ALONE.
<Litwick> Kandarihu:.... Are you fucking kidding me :| It's talking about people who MISUNDERSTAND the bible.
<TheMaster> actually Life of Brian has a very positive message towards christianity I think.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I'm Christian, and I wouldn't mind it streamed.
<alexxm> hey Yokupony hows your day been
<Acleps> This movie is like a music stream :3
<alexxm> hey guys
<GilDash> Om: ... I-I need...
<LunaTheBeloved> Yeah, I really like Chatzilla
<hooviet_Pony> RedDawn you mean Syd Barrett
<Acleps> Hey alexxm!
<Litwick> For fuck's sake, I'm an atheist and even I KNOW what the movie's trying to say.
<MaidSurge> Amen, Nittany_Discord.
<N4X> Hey Bronystate it's been a while hey alexxm
<TheMaster> its a album that tells a story
*GilDash trots away from Om.
<Kid_Cobalt> alexxm: /)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm pretty tolerant of most things.
<MaidSurge> ^
<Yokupony> not that bad alexxm, but could have been better
<Kid_Cobalt> N4X: /)
<PONY> Nittany_Discord, jsut for the record, I'm not trying to turn you away from your faith, you shouldn't try to convert me either.
<Om> Check

<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: I try to embrace out brony spirit as much as possible. :)
<RX-78-SweetieBot> heh
<LunaTheBeloved> Hehehe
<Apokalipse> lol
<N4X> Kid_Cobalt :(\
<Skydroid> So many students at school have been getting one lately

<GilDash> Om: I heard that! :)
<alexxm> failed my provisional test N4X
<TheMaster> poor pink.
<LunaTheBeloved> Not with Slurry here you can't
<Tovler|Twibfm> It's a very positive anti-religious movie. A RARITY among this sort of thing.
<ScootaBlues> David Gilmour is such a good guitarist
<LunaTheBeloved> xD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I was into tolerance before being a brony.
<otakon> Princess_Saturn: it HAS been WW2 up till now.
<GilDash> madnsdestiny: No, but I appreciate your religion. :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's a personal thing.
<Litwick> I also hate the atheist stereotype of how we always have a "vendetta against God".
<Om> GilDash: Could that be because I typed it?
<Acleps> I loved those spinny-things when I was young :D
<Dashie_Dashie> This movie needs moar desktop ponies.
<Starflash> mfw dari is still SP.
<PONY> Nittany_Discord earlier you said wanted me to stop worshipping you :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There are things I don't like.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> well, its the percent sign followed by C then it shows you the numbers for colors
<reddawn> how is this movie anti religious?
<hooviet_Pony> It jumps between his childhood and adulthood
<Viri> 14I wonder why
<TheMaster> this movie isn't anti-religious at all
<N4X> ohh sorry to hear that alexxm
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, most things then PONY.
<Litwick> reddawn: We're talking about Life of brian
<GilDash> Om: ... You are playing me like a violin right now... I'm not sure whether I like it...
<drfsupercenter> 03because they're complete idiots?
<Viri> 14I mean, it might be ok if you are some businessman or stuff like that
<PONY> :D
<alexxm> i was just 3 off passing N4X
<reddawn> oh
<Viri> 14lol
<Tovler|Twibfm> actually, anti-dogma is the best work for it.
<Om> GilDash: Puppet masters don't like to be put on strings.
<Airpuff> GilDash He most likely is xD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Worshipping internet people and cartoon horses is absurd.
<SirGanjalf> madnsdestiny: Hello fellow FSM believer /)
<Evo_Kaer> Hi everypony
<N4X> well then alexxm : can you redo it?
<otakon> hiya Evo_Kaer
<N4X> Hey Evo_Kaer
<Kandarihu> Believing what one wants to believe, doesn't exactly lend itself to being prepared for the truth.
<Skydroid> Even my chemistry teacher did
<Acleps> Hey Evo_Kaer
*Tovler|Twibfm also picks picks Dogma and Red State.
<Skydroid> and she's like
<alexxm> yeah N4X
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01i believe in Turing Machines
<PONY> Nittany_Discord, nittanydiscord.com is still going to be turned into a cult website.
<GilDash> Om: I'm no puppet master. I haven't got the smarts for that. :D
<Insert_cupcake> it does anoy me however that people pretend that religion is above criticism and being made fun of
<Skydroid> Now I have a better phone than you
<Midnight_Fyre> Honestly, I'd say the next movie today is more anti-Christian than Life of Brian
<alexxm> hey Evo_Kaer hows your day been
<Vordox> I don't admire anything online, Or in real life.
<Tovler|Twibfm> wait. I can't pick 3 movies, nevermind.
<MaidSurge> Om: they don't like people pointing out the strings eiter :D
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: Pi?
<Skydroid> In a teasing way, we're kinda like that
<Kandarihu> There are things I want to believe more than anything, but are starting to look more and more absurd.
<Vordox> Why admire something someone did deary? Really
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01i believe that thye exist, and i believe that they model any algorithmic computation
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: Pick of Destiny
<Om> MaidSurge: But I like to~
<SirGanjalf> To be honest; Life of Brian isn't very anti-christian
<Acleps> otakon: The pick of destiny :D
<N4X> alexxm : Then you'll make it next time for sure ^^
<Skydroid> So she wasn't purposelt trying to make fun of me
<Skydroid> y
<micromushroomman> bronyism is best religon
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: the hell are you on about? It's not anti religous
<Yokupony> so....what's this film about?
<Viri> 14my geography teacher is one of the best people I've ever met
<MaidSurge> Om: it's fun :D
<PONY> I believe on to my Lords and Science.
<madnsdestiny> lol life of brian is a parody of christianity
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01PONY: Well, I don't endorse the website.
<Viri> 14but he's a very religious Apple fanboy
<Evo_Kaer> alexxm, pretty boring so far, couldn't find any motivation to do something productive
<drfsupercenter> 03http://soundcloud.com/drfsupercenter/burning-up
<Viri> 14:(
<alexxm> thanks N4X
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01in other words, the only church i'm a member of *sunglasses* is the Church-Turing Thesis
<Yokupony> dat Religion argument
<TheMaster> when the tigers broke free
<PONY> Nittany_Discord, I know, nobody does.
<otakon> And then he looked at his moms knickers
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01YEEEEAAAAAAH
<TheMaster> why are we talking about religion while watching 'the wall'?
<Viri> 14and by that I mean that he tells us stuff like Apple invented the tablet, Apple invented the mp3 player etc
<Om> That and the new moon is comeing closer, and I always get a bit more hyper around a new moon. Don't know why...
<Litwick> Saturn...... no.
<Airpuff> lol Princess_Saturn xD
<SilverSonic|Android> I has soundcloud too
<GilDash> Princess_Saturn: That'd work better if I had any idea what you were talking about. :D
<otakon> Woah
<Skydroid> lol.
<PONY> TheMaster, it firs
<PONY> fits*
<SilverSonic|Android> But only one remix i did was uploaded
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: Neither one is very anti-religious really. Maybe I should have said sacriligious (praying to Dio, saying the devil is in your heart, etc.) But whatever, because it's a comedy
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fun fact: This movie was created years after the album.
<PONY> ask TheDoctor
<drfsupercenter> 03stupid copyrights
<Kandarihu> But then, as for believing what I want to believe. If I completely lose the ability to do that, then I have no place here at all.
<madnsdestiny> i want a razor like that
<drfsupercenter> 03I just tried to upload two of my edits, immediately blocked
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Album of the same name.
<madnsdestiny> where can i buy them?
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: exactly
<TheMaster> the wall is mostly anti-war anti-government and pro-not isolating yourself. very little religion talk
<Skydroid> Apple didn't invent, but they definitely had a large influence on the sales
<PrincessLuna> BANG!
<LunaTheBeloved> Yeah...
<N4X> shells here
<Dashie_Dashie> dem magnum rounds
<SilverSonic|Android> Eh i only upload vg stuff
<ScootaBlues> Nittany_Discord seems to be taking Silverscreen's role of random fact announcer.
<GilDash> Om: What am I going to do with you now?
<Acleps> I have absolutely no clue what's going on... :D
<Midnight_Fyre> Life of Brian on the other hand is really just a parody of religion
<Viri> 14I agree, Skydroid
<Evo_Kaer> interesting discussion
<otakon> ScootaBlues: someone needs to!
<brony_swan> im back everypony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Son, get dressed. We've got a war to go to.
<SilverSonic|Android> Even though the one i uploaded wasnt vgm
<Skydroid> Since people assume all MP3s are called iPods
<Viri> 14I still can't understand though
<Yokupony> I'm guessong this movie is base on the Pink Floyd album of the same name?
<drfsupercenter> 03because >RDF
<RX-78-SweetieBot> this is gonna be an ant-war movie isnt it?
<TheMaster> the main characters father dies at anzio. He feels awful about it.
<Evo_Kaer> should have come earlier ^^
<Insert_cupcake> becuase religion is funny
<RX-78-SweetieBot> anti*
<Yokupony> based*
<N4X> Welcome back brony_swan
<PONY> ScootaBlues, there will always be fun facts from the streamer
<Insert_cupcake> because*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nah. I did trivia once way back.

<N4X> hell yeah i love swans :D
<Yokupony> cat!
<Dashie_Dashie> kitty
<SilverSonic|Android> It was an original song remix as part of a open remix group
<Starflash> who knows? :3
<drfsupercenter> 03RDF, that's why.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01For Twister.

<Om> GilDash: Get thinking.
<alexxm> hey brony_swan what have you been up to
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I hope not
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay, cartoon.
<MaidSurge> THIS SCENE :'(
<TheMaster> mother before the education part. I always approved of the movie part
<LunaTheBeloved> Possibly
<PrincessLuna> WOAH
<PONY> lol blood
<reddawn> you know this is based on a true story .... well kinda
<N4X> HOLY!
<otakon> the buck........
<RX-78-SweetieBot> anti-war stuff annoys me
<PrincessLuna> WOAH
<Dashie_Dashie> wat
<Acleps> Wait... is this movie going in the wrong direction??
<Yokupony> suddenly, animated
<micromushroomman> grusome
<LordDerpington> D-d-d-did you see the frightened ones?
<Metronome> WTH
<Kandarihu> So since it's an anti-war film, I suppose there will be no context for the war. It's just war for the sake of backwards humanity?
<TheMaster> also. the animator for hercules did all this animation
*GilDash kisses Om tentatively.
<Skydroid> Some girl had a Zune, someone else was like, "Cool iPod!"
<PrincessLuna> What the hay
<brony_swan> ive been playin some bf3
<Dashie_Dashie> so trippy
<hooviet_Pony> Nazi's
<LunaTheBeloved> Woah

<drfsupercenter> 03Zunes are awesome
<RX-78-SweetieBot> oh god
<Viri> 14xD
<micromushroomman> the horor
<ScootaBlues> Fun Fact: The animation in this is done by the same man who did Disney's Hercules.
<SlurryMoon> 3LunaTheBeloved, test out your colors :P
<ScootaBlues> I think.
<Skydroid> Same.class too LOL
<LunaTheBeloved> Um

<Midnight_Fyre> Also topical would be the Who's Tommy, which is also a commentary on religion
<PrincessLuna> Dat blood
<Dashie_Dashie> woahhhhhhhh dudeeeeeeeeee
<LordDerpington> Well, Gerald Scarfe did the character designs for Hercules.
<Kid_Cobalt> Transformers moar than meets the eye =3
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01oh god, an art film by Pink Floyd
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah I've had people ask me what kind of iPod I have

<RX-78-SweetieBot> Well, silly stuff happens in here
<Midnight_Fyre> Princess_Saturn: Neither am I really. I respect the hell out of their talent, but I never got into them much. I'm more of a Led Zeppelin/Deep Purple fan
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm getting up.

*Starflash waves at SlurryMoon
<LunaTheBeloved> Heheh

<GilDash> Om: ... I think I need to process all of this...
<hooviet_Pony> It's anti War
<PONY> who said there was nothing to do with religions here?

<Acleps> PONY: Just to make sure I survive through this movie
<micromushroomman> religonkills people

<reddawn> yea here we go
<Litwick> They told me when I had a broken arm to go to the Red Cross.....
<PONY> Acleps, easily
<Acleps> Gotta love that british accent
<Litwick> But this is ridiculoius!
<N4X> ohhh
<Yokupony> that accent could be more forced if they tried
<Insert_cupcake> lol
<GilDash> PONY: Oi! :|
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01PONY: why do you always talk about religion? aren't there more interesting things to talk about?
<N4X> poor kid
<Skydroid> Oh, and another thing: I have second gen iPod and all these people who have the latest are all like, "WTF IS THAT AN.IPHONE?" since old iPhone was thicker, I think
<Apokalipse> I once applied for a mod position, but failed. xD
<otakon> brony_swan: a bit, and so far I am freaking confuzzled
<Om> GilDash: Shirking back again? Take all the time you need. No rush for time.
<Kandarihu> Atheism killed more people than every organized religion combined, though.
<otakon> oh god
<Acleps> PONY: We'll see :)
<N4X> like ponies!
<ACS13123> O hey...theres a train....ITS COMPLETELY SAFE
<Evo_Kaer> micromushroomman: no people kill people, BECAUSE of religion
<PrincessLuna> Uh oh
<Apokalipse> Interview was scary though
<brony_swan> ditto
<LunaTheBeloved> Oh Cello otakon
<Yokupony> I see where this is going......
<TheMaster> there is a album about anti-war and communication to be discussed
<PONY> Acleps, I have mindfucked you so many times, you are surely prepared
<GilDash> Om: What do you want from me?
<N4X> NO!

<Acleps> PONY: You? When?
<PONY> I like trains
<Litwick> I REALLY like trains
<brony_swan> lol
<alexxm> hey LunaTheBeloved hows your day been
<otakon> SHITE!
<ACS13123> SUS
<Acleps> That doesn't seem safe :D
<Midnight_Fyre> Kandarihu: ATHEISTS have killed more people than religious people, but not in the name of atheism
<ACS13123> DUDE
<RX-78-SweetieBot> lol
<LunaTheBeloved> I'm doing fine :)
<MaidSurge> That train is dead
<Dashie_Dashie> IT'S THE HOGWARTS TRAIN
<N4X> and thats how equestria was made
<ACS13123> DED
<ScootaBlues> Mozdoc: Why are you glad you only listened to Another Brick in The Wall Part 2/Comfortably Numb (it's probably one of those two...) I can understand why you dislike the imagery, but what's the matter with the music?
<otakon> and he's lucky he wasn't shot
<PONY> Acleps, you dont really have any idea who I am, do you?
<ACS13123> nearly...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Have a train run over a bullet. Smart.
<Viri> 14I liked the old iPods
<Om> GilDash: I don't want anything really. And what of you?
<SlurryMoon> 3oh gog...

<Starflash> So why did you fail? Oo
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01Kid_Cobalt: it was funny the first million times, but it's kinda losing it now, dude
<LunaTheBeloved> How scary?
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate all iPods.

<drfsupercenter> 03it wasn't
<Dashie_Dashie> WAT
<Viri> 14D:

<Silor101> O_o
<Mozdoc> Placing bullets on the tracks? Yeah that's a brilliant idea.
<Skydroid> Haters gonna hate
<Viri> 14I like them :(
<Acleps> PONY: I do, but my memory is shorter than you might think :D
<drfsupercenter> 03you'd end up overscrolling
<SlurryMoon> 3...
<jmicromushroomman> love this song
<GilDash> Om: ... I'd like you...
<Insert_cupcake> all my wat
<ACS13123> Woah....
<otakon> the hell was wrong with their facees?
<LunaTheBeloved> The hell is this....
<ACS13123> wut?
<N4X> Seems legit
<TheMaster> here comes one of the most famous parts of this album. the one everyone knows
<madnsdestiny> I doubt that atheists have killed more people considering the small amount of them throughout history
<alexxm> what just happened
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01placing a bullet on the tracks wouldn't do anything
<hooviet_Pony> it only gets more trippy from here
<drfsupercenter> 03and you can't seek accurately for s***
<GilDash> PONY: Doesn't know what?
<Kid_Cobalt> Princess_Saturn: hahaha I know I know i'm just trolling ya' guy.
<Apokalipse> Dunno, I just didn't get the position. Ah well, good thing since soon after that I started coming here less and less
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01BRB.
<MaidSurge> Jew trains ;__;
<ScootaBlues> And here comes the most famous song on the album.
<Midnight_Fyre> LunaTheBeloved: The Wall
<brony_swan> so does this movie have a point
<otakon> Om, GilDash try to keep it down eh?
<Dashie_Dashie> this movie has all of my wut
<Om> GilDash: I don't see why, you have so many. Willy counterparts.
<madnsdestiny> a larger precentage might have but religions have destroyed civilizations
<PONY> Acleps, that's a common side effect of being mindfucked
<HyperMetalLugia> oh volume control
<Litwick> Takes new meaning to BULLET TRAIN.
<Viri> 14just calibrate the sensibility? o.o
<N4X> Like? In England the fuck? MaidSurge ?!
<MaidSurge> Epic song.
<Yokupony> note to self: don't listen to Pink Floyd when sober.....
<HyperMetalLugia> time to fail
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01Kid_Cobalt: well, you're trolling yourself, because i'm the one with the magic kick button
<otakon> brony_swan: just a mindbuck really
<Starflash> ah, ya
<Kammerjunk> This is oddly accurate.
<Acleps> PONY: Damn... any way of restoring it?
<GilDash> Om: But I thought I liked you. And you're the only one on my level...
<brony_swan> oh...its working...and i think i like it
<twilight_sprinkler> a secant code???
<Skydroid> iPod Nano annoys me
<Yokupony> dat Welsh
<Dashie_Dashie> Princess_Saturn has all the swag.
<Skydroid> Sis has one
<otakon> Wow, what a asshole
<LunaTheBeloved> Only thing about Chatzilla, it doesn't ping me when somepony says my nick
<Dashie_Dashie> ALL OF IT
<Insert_cupcake> nothing wrong with poems
<Apokalipse> And now when I come back I barely know anyone anymore :x
<TheMaster> money, by pink floyd
<Kandarihu> It's not literally in the name of atheism. But one man who was bound only by his only sense of reason tried to modernize his country, and in the process 70 million people died pointlessly. His name was Chairman Mao.
<MaidSurge> N4X: hallucinations and history imagination.
<Kammerjunk> I had a teacher like this once.
<Skydroid> You can't turn it.off completely
<drfsupercenter> 03Viri, it still can't seek accurately
<Midnight_Fyre> The laddie reckons himself a poet
<drfsupercenter> 03sure you can
<drfsupercenter> 03just use a hammer
<Skydroid> Only sleep mode.or whatever
<SilverSonic|Android> Sigh
<Kammerjunk> TheMaster: Aye, in DSotM.
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01my swag makes my bum look big
<drfsupercenter> 03it'll never turn back on
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Skydroid> Wasting battery
<PONY> Acleps: Ask GilDash, he seems to be doing quite fine, being part of my chaos and all
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I think you can set it to somehow
<Om> GilDash: I dobut this scale is as machined as levels.
<Viri> 14LOL
<Kammerjunk> If ye don' eat yer meat, ye can't have any puddin'! How can ya have any puddin' if ye don' eat yer meat?!

<RX-78-SweetieBot> I want pudding...
<GilDash> Om: I have no idea what you just said.
<brony_swan> O_O
<Starflash> dammit
<Acleps> GilDash: Any advice on restoring memory after a "treatment" from PONY? :D
<Kammerjunk> Also, I had a teacher like that once.
<Kammerjunk> He was a douche.
<TheMaster> here it comes
<PONY> Princess_Saturn, why is anyone ever talking about religion anyway
<Dashie_Dashie> all of my wut
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01everyone's talking about China
<N4X> MaidSurge : Oh well then...I also guessed that should be a jew train,but i wondered why the heck
<ScootaBlues> here we go.
<Starflash> so welsh I spelled arround instead of around.
<LunaTheBeloved> Spanking
<Skydroid> Battery only lasts so long in.sleep mode/hibernation
<Litwick> Child beating! Totally ethical!
<GilDash> Acleps: What kind of treatment are we talking about here? ;)
<LunaTheBeloved> Paddling I mean
<ACS13123> Education...we dont need no....
<Kandarihu> Saturn, not everybody. Just me
<Om> GilDash: Just ranting. I do that, lots of time to think I have.
<madnsdestiny> rainbow factory lol
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01PONY: that was both a rhetorical, and leading, question
<Yokupony> dat symbolism....again
<jmicromushroomman> SYMBOLISM!!!
<Acleps> GilDash: Straight up mind bucking
<PONY> GilDash, common term would be "mindfuck"
<N4X> Oh my....why so high?!
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01as in, quit trying to make drama
<MaidSurge> Litwick: at the times, it was.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I need a snack now...

<Yokupony> and this is why I don't like Public Education
<HyperMetalLugia> My sansa that is 4+ years old still works
<SirGanjalf> (ughh again)Kandarihu: I didn't hear about any atheistic organizations that wanted to kill religious people(no, Communism doesn't count)
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<N4X> sorry if I misheard that
<Skydroid> Nay
<Starflash> Sooo The Wall is basically one big creepypasta?
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<HyperMetalLugia> cheap little thing
<PONY> Princess_Saturn, I am the DRAMA Queen.
*Rain soft rocks
<ACS13123> alexxm: no its all of my WAT THE F

<Acleps> GilDash: Then how are you doing so well :O?
<Skydroid> Unless you have a replacement
<drfsupercenter> 03mine has a large physical BREAK in it
<GilDash> Om: I'd like to spend more time thinking with you...
<Kammerjunk> Fun fact: "Spanking" in school was made illegal in Denmark 1969, the same as pornography was made legal to distribute.
<ACS13123> kinda...
<Skydroid> Cuz then no music at all
<drfsupercenter> 03like a CHUNK of plastic missing
<drfsupercenter> 03works fine

<ScootaBlues> This song is so good.
<SilverSonic|Android> Its 4th gen
<Viri> 14my KIWUEI is two years old and it got problems with his jack
<Kandarihu> Those 70 million people died during peace time.

<Viri> 14<w<
<SirGanjalf> ^
<LordDerpington> How can you have any cupcakes if you don't eat your hay?
<ScootaBlues> Less good than Comfortably Numb, but still incredible.
<Airpuff> Hmpf... talk about symnolic =s
<GilDash> Acleps: I'm immune. I was introduced to the internet at a young age. :)
<TheMaster> another brick in the wall part 2
<Kid_Cobalt> Lolsz

<SilverSonic|Android> As in glass shattered
<otakon> the gears
<Skydroid> lol4gen
<Om> GilDash: You cant think like I do around others. It dosen't work that way.
<LunaTheBeloved> POEMS
<ScootaBlues> Acleps: This and Comfortably Numb
<Midnight_Fyre> Kandarihu: Yes, but the deaths under Mao were due to totalitarianism and a horrible economic system. Atheism had nothing to do with it. This is coming from a Methodist
<ACS13123> I love this song you know?
<Dashie_Dashie> HEY
<ScootaBlues> LEAVE THEM KIDS ALONE
<Dashie_Dashie> TEACHER
<otakon> so THAT is what that scene is from

<xmasskills> wow stream is hawt

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So much suggestion.
<N4X> SirGanjalf : I thought it was pretty easy to interpret them : The monkeys in the begining got the ability to think by it. and it always jumps: The monlyths are a symbol for progress
<Om> Ded
<drfsupercenter> 03the movie 3 came from Ireland, I think the account name is like irelanditunes@drfsupercenter.info? XD
<Kandarihu> Man, half of the reason I got into anime was to avoid stuff like this.
<PONY> xmasskills, ah, so you do belong, for a second there, I was afraid you had mistaken me for somepony else. Also stop kicking, that's He-Who-Shall-not-be-NAMED's job
<madnsdestiny> anyone see the movie teeth?
<Yokupony> lolwut
*RyunosukeKnT switches off, I know what this is, I still have nightmares about this, and not in a good way
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03No offense, but I'm not into this kind of things, I mean it's coool if you guys do....
<drfsupercenter> 03I make random emails to abuse iTunes store purchases

<Insert_cupcake> Dayum Nature! YOU SCARY
<Kammerjunk> I don't know, but I sure do like the artstyle of the animated scenes.
<ScootaBlues> They're not even being subtle about it.
<Evo_Kaer> HOLY "buy some apples"

<Apokalipse> Can't ahndle the movie, get out <.<

<Apokalipse> I'm refering to the mane chat btw

<Acleps> GilDash: I remeber.... something....
<Cypresswolf> Kandarihu: You've must never have heard of Heavy Metal
<drfsupercenter> 03it's part of the joy of having my own domain
<Kammerjunk> Apokalipse: What are ponies complaining about?
<drfsupercenter> 03and yes?
<reddawn> its da walll
<Ryunosuke> the problem I have is... the one time I seen this... I was drunk... VERY VERY drunk
<Viri> 14which format do you think it's better for videos?
<otakon> and here comes the mindfuckery
<N4X> O_O
<Viri> 14what's the .wav format of videos? xD
<Rain> have stream open, tab out and do other things while listening to the good music
<HyperMetalLugia> avi
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<Kandarihu> I have heard of it. AFAIK, that's western animation, though.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Damn wall broke the church.
<Dark_Horst> this is interesting#
<N4X> I didn't even---
*Acleps looks at PONY with a puzzled stare
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> 0_0
<HyperMetalLugia> that's the more general
<drfsupercenter> 03there are very few lossless video codecs
<HyperMetalLugia> but
<HyperMetalLugia> .ts
<Insert_cupcake> suddenly tron
<madnsdestiny> ._.
<Dken2021> welll... that just happened
<LordDerpington> It's gone all Tron
<drfsupercenter> 03and they're usually huge
<HyperMetalLugia> possibly?
<PONY> xmasskills, really, the kicking belongs to the one who hasn't spoken tonight
<drfsupercenter> 03HuffYUV and uh
<drfsupercenter> 03Lagarith
<TheMaster> i like this version of empty spaces way more than the other one in the album
<Ryunosuke> rain, the problem is... I cant really listen to it either ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03you can store it in AVI, mp4 etc
<PONY> Acleps, do you remember anything?
<drfsupercenter> 03thing with videos
<Apokalipse> Not complaining. Just comments like these: OMFGIAHFIAWEHFUHWUIFASDFAHUIAWRG FLOWER INTERCOURSE being repeated 5 billion times
<Kammerjunk> That it did.
<SirGanjalf> N4X: Oh i know that - monolyth we're always there when humanity had to take the next step in progress and evolution, but i heard the sequel speaks more about the origin of it
<GilDash> PONY: Do go on if you wish...
<drfsupercenter> 03avi, mp4, mkv, ogm, all of those are just containers
<Kammerjunk> Aha.
<drfsupercenter> 03what matters are the CODECS
<Yokupony> I.....I don't even
<Ryunosuke> the images were burned into my brain ;)
<Dark_Horst> DRUGS!
<teh_Tharassan> ....0__0
<otakon> Ryunosuke: my mind
<Viri> 14I see
<TheMaster> WITH OUR BACKS TO THE WALL!
<drfsupercenter> 03XVID was a common one a few years ago and I still use it for quick stuff (not the best quality though)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Is this what eating 'Shrooms does to you?
<PONY> GilDash, just don't tell him to undress and do that
<ScootaBlues> Most of this film's imagery is just pretentious yet obvious metaphorical allegories about sex and self destruction.
<Dark_Horst> this is amazing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01'Dose hammers.
<Acleps> PONY: Yes.... something....But... I'm not sure
<SirGanjalf> RIOTS
<drfsupercenter> 03H264 is the newer accepted "good" format, and is what most BLu-Rays use
<LunaTheBeloved> Brb
<Yokupony> no more skooma for me
<xmasskills> PONY you deserve to be kicked for all your crimes
<drfsupercenter> 03whereas mpeg-2 is what DVDs and HDTV uses
<hooviet_Pony> Scoot: yes
<Viri> 14I would like to use one to make a 1:1 dvdrip
<GilDash> PONY: What'd be wrong with that? ;)
<Apokalipse> It's cool I like it
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: no, this is what LIVING in one does to you
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, videos are compliated
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol h264
<Viri> 14I don't care about the space
<SirGanjalf> HAMMERTIME!
<drfsupercenter> 03just rip it as ISO...
<HyperMetalLugia> xvid plz?
<Magical_pablez94> alexxm: no need to sorry... it's all okay now... my dentist saved the tooth and now i have to eat mixed stuff for 1-2 weeks but nothing to worring about...
<PONY> HALT! HAMMERZEIT!
<Ryunosuke> lets put it this way, this doesnt make sense when sane, imagine something NOT making sense, while everything ELSE is not making sense :)
<Dken2021> I'll just call it art, don't understand any of it
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01http://www.theatheistpig.com/comics/2012-05-16.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03ISO is a 1:1 copy of the *entire disc*
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01<3
<xmasskills> Acleps: kick PONY for me my leg is getting tired
<drfsupercenter> 03with special features, menus etc
<drfsupercenter> 03that's all I rip stuff as anymore xD
<N4X> SirGanjalf : That would be cool... And I always asked myslef : Who burried the fucking monolyth on the moon? Aliens or a super natural force? Or himself?!
<Kammerjunk> ScootaBlues: That's more or less what the thing's about. I prefer the album over the film, though.
<Viri> 14mh
<Acleps> GilDash: Wha....what's going on.....?
<N4X> PONY :LOL You german?
<ScootaBlues> Kammerjunk: I prefer the album because I can put it on my iPod ._.
<TheMaster> pink is a rock star. his wife cheated on him and now a bunch of groupies are going to a back stage thing
<Kammerjunk> That too.
<Litwick> And then everyone got WATSED
<TheMaster> this is called 'young lust'
<Apokalipse> I can put the movie on my iPod...
<madnsdestiny> lol saturn.
<Viri> 14that's not a bad idea, actually
<PONY> N4X, well I live in Germany.
<Viri> 14I could use a virtual drive to watch them
<xmasskills> Princess_Saturn: please do not place your political views on others
<Apokalipse> :p
<Kammerjunk> So can I, but I don't like watching films on a 2" display.
<drfsupercenter> 03that's exactly what I do.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> 0///0
<GilDash> Acleps: I don't know. What do you want to go on? ;)
<Yokupony> O________________________O
<N4X> PONY : Schön zu hören :D
<Magical_pablez94> dat explicit content
<Litwick> Black guy's face wen
<SirGanjalf> N4X: I think Monolyths were self-conscious in some way, so the last version might be possible
<Apokalipse> 2'' would be luxury. I have an iPod classic
<drfsupercenter> 03though you can technically strip the languages you don't want, etc using DVD Shrink
<drfsupercenter> 03just turn compression off
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Kammerjunk> Ah.
<PONY> xmasskills... So after all, you are new here.
<Magical_pablez94> Litwick: hahahahahahahaha
<Dken2021> lol Princess_Saturn
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01xmasskills: i'm not; i'm merely sharing a comic i found funny
<Acleps> GilDash: I'm.....not sure..... everything seems.....strange...
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01xmasskills: it's up to you whether you agree with it or not; i'm not saying you should
<Apokalipse> But small screen doesn't bother me. I like having a lot of space on it
<Kammerjunk> Good this RAWRity isn't here. He'd go crazy over all the metaphors and allegories.
<Cypresswolf> I'll be back later - got to pick something up
<PONY> N4X, bitte sprechen English im chat:)
*GilDash nuzzels Acleps.
<ScootaBlues> Plus, you can't split the movie into individual songs and shuffle them along with the rest of your library :P
<SirGanjalf> inb4 boobs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why are we arguing politics and religion during a stream?
<PONY> boobs
<Viri> 14nah, I'll take everything x3
<N4X> PONY : Yes of course, excuse me
<GilDash> Acleps: It's okay, I'll take care of you.
<Yokupony> boobs!
<Kammerjunk> Nittany_Discord: Because BronyState.
<Apokalipse> You could have both the movie and album :o
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, DVD Decrypter
<drfsupercenter> 03store it as ISO
<ScootaBlues> Kammerjunk: I'm debating whether I should or not, but to be honest it would probably just be typing effort wasted given no one in mane would read it.
<Om> Sooo, when do the funky drawing start up again?
<Viri> 14recently I'm watching my DVD movies in their original languages
<N4X> PONY : Why are you in Germany right now? Are you studying here or...=
<Evo_Kaer> Nittany_Discord: because the movie seems to drive us too
<Dken2021> Bronystate: where we discuss politics and ponies
<Kammerjunk> So #bronystate went oatmeal over a pair of flowers doing it, but not boobs.
<Cypresswolf|AFK> shame, I was just getting into this
<Viri> 14they are all american/japanese, so...
*Acleps rests head on GilDash "Thanks...."
<Kandarihu> Dangit! I really didn't want to see that
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pony 2012.
<Kammerjunk> I can't imagine why.
<ScootaBlues> That's because #bronystate is fucking stupid these days.
<Viri> 14Scrubs is not fun in English though
*Viri runs
*GilDash kisses Acleps on the forhead.
<xmasskills> Princess_Saturn: im fine with the topic i just dont find political comics all that funny those damned suited douche bags writing semi funny material just to make it serious
<alexxm> i miss much Kandarihu
<Apokalipse> Yup
<PONY> N4X, (also to hide the fact that my german is bad), I'm in Berlin, I work here
<GilDash> Acleps: No worries. :)
<N4X> Hm...but Ponies never kidnapped children
<Kammerjunk> That's the price of manestream.
<hooviet_Pony> i'm gonna visit Germany in September
<ScootaBlues> WHY
<Dken2021> maybe the flowers meant something to them
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf
<alexxm> says who N4X
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Can't we argue about Santana and why it never got its own movie?
<Litwick> Remember when THAT was a thing Nittany? And everyone was a sheep and believed it?
<ScootaBlues> WHY CAN'T IT BE LIKE THE OLD DAYS
<GilDash> Back in a bit. :)
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01xmasskills: i personally find there to be truth in this one, though; it's fair enough if you don't like it
<drfsupercenter> 03you know
<xmasskills> GilDash x Acleps has been confirmed as cannon
<ScootaBlues> WHEN 12 YEAR OLDS DIDN'T FILL UP THE CHAT
<N4X> alexxm : O_O
<Ryunosuke> hooviet_Pony, wait a month, Octoberfest :)
<GabeMaid64> Scoot-Scootaloo, No
<drfsupercenter> 03I heard in the Spanish dub of Scrubs... those scenes where Carla is speaking Spanish, they dubbed it to another language
<TheMaster> this song is called. 'one of my turns'
<drfsupercenter> 03Italian I think
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03:(
<N4X> no fanfics alexxm :D
*Acleps hugs GilDash tightly
<Dken2021> because summer vacation
<RX-78-SweetieBot> says the jailbait
<drfsupercenter> 03which is silly as Italian is like mostly the same as Spanish?
<Kammerjunk> I much prefer the album version over the film version.
<ScootaBlues> AND WE COULD HAVE DEEP INTELLECTUAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE INNER MACHINATIONS OF Rarity and Twilight Sparkle.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Litwick: I sure did. Dunno if it was for nothing.
<alexxm> whay N4X

<xmasskills> PONY: the secrets that will get alexxm sent to jail or the ones that will get him lynched
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't do that.
<Viri> 14in middle school, I could hardly understand my spanish teacher xD
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01xmasskills: if you want funny satire, you should see some of the Punch comics from the 80s about Margaret Thatcher
<pyrocatboy> alexxm: Meh
<Skydroid> yay Japanese
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just did a reblog on Tumblr.
<Yokupony> I am Welsh :)

<Kammerjunk> I remember one particular discussion during a live-stream about whether or not a dimension where Equestria exists would be possible.

<GabeMaid64> Princess_Saturn, /b/ is the cancer that's killing /b/
<Kammerjunk> Nobody rages like Gaston.
<bluesun> 3.ts isn't lossless :s it's just something else(mpeg-2/h.264) with a wrapper around it. which means usually there's no point in ever converting to .ts
<PONY> /b/ception
<Dken2021> GabeMaid64 eeyup
<alexxm> ah right she was before my time Saturn
<Ryunosuke> actually /b/ is the cancer that is killing the web :)
<PONY> someponies forgot rule 1&2 again

<Dken2021> those are some dusty blinds
<SirGanjalf> Sketch_Toku_Brony: I think someone spoiled it for him:D
<ScootaBlues> Kammerjunk: Indeed
<Kandarihu> Come to think of it, A Life Aquatic turned out to be a pretty good movie.
<xmasskills> Princess_Saturn: some of these are really good but you have to know the proper context for others
<Mozdoc> There went the TV.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<N4X> but otakon : Her eyes are open...I didn't knew ponies could to that...
<Vordox> This movie is just....just...so...just...
<LunaTheBeloved> Hey, ScootaBlues, is there anyway to make a pinging sound when someone says your name?

<LordDerpington> Midnight_Fyre: Pink's wife cheated on him, he had a groupie backstage but a war movie on TV made him lose his mind and have a massive rage fit.
<Litwick> Pool period
<Starflash> What would Otakon be in french anyways?
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01xmasskills: aye, that's certainly true

<Kammerjunk> LunaTheBeloved
<ScootaBlues> Otakon said something in a skype call yesterday and I somehow mutated it into otakon being French
<Kandarihu> I can't even call this movie art anymore. It's just pure weapons-grade angst.
<Vordox> xmasskills: As I said, take some toilett paper and stick it up, make sure no air gets in to stop the blood plasma
<LunaTheBeloved> Nope
<GabeMaid64> xmasskills, stick your face in ice
<LunaTheBeloved> No sound

<TheMaster> coagulate
<Vordox> Convulant..
<LunaTheBeloved> Yeah
<Vordox> Yeah Coagulate
<xmasskills> dudes you dont understand the gravity of the situation my nose is practicly running with blood and Vordox the toilet paper gets soaked in like 3 min

<N4X> Hey I want a room as big as that
<MahBoi777> WHOA
<Vordox> xmasskills: Put some toilet paper in your nose, and use the pinch at the bone structure of your nose. that WILL stop the bleeding but...
<TheMaster> he has a lot of televisions

<Kid_Cobalt> Guitar Hero Rage =D
<N4X> TV = infinit?
<Vordox> I'm no doctor. :P Not from text alone
<TheMaster> another brick in the wall. part 3
<PONY> I love politics
<LunaTheBeloved> Try now
<Tovler> damn internet.
<xmasskills> well what Vordox
<Vordox> xmasskills: Use the pinch at the tip of your bone structure of your nose.
<Kammerjunk> LunaTheBeloved
<Dken2021> Vordox can't you mess upi your nose that way?
<Kandarihu> I'm getting tempted to stop watching. This is too much angst, and it seems to be getting WORSE since I complained about it a few minutes ago
<Om> xmasskills: Take a tissue of paper towl or toilet paper, and wad it up to plug your nose. Lay back or tilt you head back and pinck the bridge of your nose.
<LunaTheBeloved> Once more
<Kammerjunk> LunaTheBeloved
<N4X> So...is it over or is this just a...intermezzo/revision part ?
<Magical_pablez94> pyrocatboy: hey but... do u do, sometimes , something different than posting images?:)
<Vordox> That's the main circuit of blood causing the rush
<Evo_Kaer> this music is actually the news + music
<LunaTheBeloved> Yeah nothing
<Kammerjunk> Ping her. Ping her ha- no
*Nittany_Discord 11,01bricks
<PONY> bleed the the blood on a cup, drink the blood, problem solved
<TheMaster> and now the wall is complete
<N4X> wow
<ScootaBlues> Kandarihu: Moosic
<Hawksight> dat smoke
<Evo_Kaer> TEAR THE WALL DOWN
<Vordox> you can't mess up your blood circuit of your nose UNLESS it's already messed up.
<pyrocatboy> Magical_pablez94 : I'm sometimes a maid.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Luna, try clicking on another window for a bit
<xmasskills> Om: been doing that for a while all that happens is the toilet paper gets soaked and the blood goes to the back of my throat
<Kammerjunk> Erectin' a Goodbye Cruel World!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> and then someone ping her
<TheMaster> this is the end of part 1
<Vordox> Besides, it sounds more like a blood Rush, usually caused by High Blood Pressure.
<SirGanjalf> inb4 suicide
<TheMaster> you'd have to switch cd's, albums at this point
<Hawksight> high res
<GabeMaid64> xmasskills, pinch harder
<Kammerjunk> LunaTheBeloved
<alexxm> i'm sorry but does this film have a plot or is it just random events with random music in the background
<ScootaBlues> LunaTheBeloved: Go back to Global settings and put the word 'beep' in the box next to the phrase 'Channel: Stalk Match'
<Litwick> Good hello!
<PONY> OO! xmasskillss, collect the blood! you have a serious change to make some 1m dollar modern art!
<Magical_pablez94> pyrocatboy: ok....O.O (watches carefully the BOY of da nickname)
<Yokupony> Well, I'm now das
<TheMaster> it does have a plot. you have to pay attention
<Yokupony> sad*
<LunaTheBeloved> Done try it now
<Om> xmasskills: Try bigger wads? and if you are really that concerned you can seek medical attention.
<Kandarihu> Wait a minute. Was this movie made before the Berlin Wall fell?
<alexxm> hey Litwick hows your day been
<Kammerjunk> LunaTheBeloved
<N4X> hm...did you ever imagined what would happen if you were able to open portals of some kind the other universes/dimensions?
<TheMaster> the plot is. Pink Floyd, the main character, grew up without a father because he died in ww2.
<Litwick> Fine.
<otakon> yeah, this movie is freaking me out
<LunaTheBeloved> Yeah...nothing
<pyrocatboy> Magical_pablez94 : Maid Hour
<Evo_Kaer> Kandarihu: good question
<xmasskills> ok i think the bleeding stopped
<Kammerjunk> Pinging is serious business, apparently.
<TheMaster> his mother basically smothered him and he began building a wall to isolate himself from the world. he became a rock star and then his wife cheats on him
<PONY> what a waste
<xmasskills> but im feeling kinda light headed
<ScootaBlues> LunaTheBeloved: Have you tried going to another window?
<SirGanjalf> Kandarihu: It was
<N4X> well 142 people here :3
<TheMaster> at this point pink has totally isolated himself from everything and everyone.
<LunaTheBeloved> count to three then try
<ScootaBlues> Minimize Chatzilla and then I'll ping you again
<TheMaster> and this has nothing to do with the berlin wall
<GabeMaid64> xmasskills, it's lupus
<Wrek> 05ohai
<ScootaBlues> LunaTheBeloved:
<Kammerjunk> LunaTheBeloved
<Kandarihu> Okay. That makes things a bit better.
<Vordox> Pinching hard, xmasskills ?
<Apokalipse> hai Wrek
<N4X> your face god damnit!
<Dken2021> lali-ho Wrek
<LunaTheBeloved> Yep nothing
<Magical_pablez94> O.O pyrocatboy are u ok?
<xmasskills> GabeMaid64: whats lupus
<Yokupony> Sup Wrek
<reddawn> its bascily about a guy that hated is life so much that he shut himself off from the world
<N4X> Hey Wrek !
<Kammerjunk> I don't even get pings. I get yays.
<ScootaBlues> Alright, time for one last thing.
<Vordox> Oh wait, he can't type unless he's pinching.
<xmasskills> Vordox: the bleeding stopped but im light headed now
<pyrocatboy> Magical_pablez94 : yep
<ScootaBlues> Check the volume on your computer.

<pyrocatboy> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqpu39xwhx1r2ulmeo1_r1_500.png
<Vordox> xmasskills: That happens with blood loss, it's not a bad sign unless you lose more blood.
<LunaTheBeloved> Its at 25
<Acleps> Wow, it's hard to follow up with everything at the same time :S
<Apokalipse> dis guitar

<N4X> Neurosen pretty much...
<Magical_pablez94> pyrocatboy: oh well! at least u'r no more answering me with meh and nothing else...:)
<PONY> <3 Surprise
<ScootaBlues> Go to the mixer and check Chatzilla
<alexxm> i'm sorry but does this film have a plot or is it just random events with random music in the background
<Kandarihu> This movie is in horrible taste nowadays, but more understandable when one ponders the disparity between West Germany and East Germany.
<Vordox> Just make sure the blood doesn't move, and make sure the toilet papper stop the air to get to your blood area.
<Om> Gypsy magic?
<pyrocatboy> Magical_pablez94 meh
<xmasskills> ok sweet i have to go guys school calls see everyone in like 3 hours
<xmasskills> bye
<Vordox> That'll cause a coagulation, and that should be good

<xmasskills> PONY save those candah kisses
<Kandarihu> alexxm, it's about a retired soldier going through HORRIBLE PTSD
<Rain> this guitar work makes me want to listen to The House of the Rising Sun
<Evo_Kaer> bye xmasskills
<Magical_pablez94> pyrocatboy: obvious and foreseeable
<PONY> <3
<Kammerjunk> INB4 he goes insane.
<Wrek> 05so i just founded a colony and began erecting mining facilities. but didnt give much thought on any defence. so a dude sent a large cago vessel to my colony, basically getting free loot. when i noticed i sent my fleet of 20 cruisers, 1 battleship and 50 fighters to his homeworld. accompanied by 7 cargo vessels. now i have a shitload of loot on the way back.
<Vordox> PTSD?
<PONY> <--- wot?
<LunaTheBeloved> Yep its good
<Kandarihu> Not sure if that's the entirety of the movie.
<ScootaBlues> TL;DR
<Dken2021> He's missing a pick of destiny, I deem this shrine a poor excuse
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Ouch...
<Kandarihu> Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

<TheMaster> he doesn't have PTSD. he's just depressed and isolated himself from the world
<alexxm> blood for the blood god
<TheMaster> his father died in ww2
<ScootaBlues> People complaining about the video, why don't you just listen to the music? I'm pretty sure that isn't something you can complain about.

<RaveBrony> Same
<pyrocatboy> WTF/10
<alexxm> why ishsexest
<Kammerjunk> LunaTheBeloved
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01i'm thinking either a jet engine, another tesla coil, or a metal cello
<Dken2021> LTB
<ScootaBlues> This film gets a Roger Waters/10
<Midnight_Fyre> Dafuq?/10
<Om> So what is the moral of the story?
<alexxm> why IshSexestPony
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01out of those, the metal cello would be the hardest, i think
<MaidSurge> The best musical trip ever/10 :$
<Mozdoc> And all these names now also completely went batshit after this was finished I think.
<derpy_pony> guess I missed the best film of the week here
<IshSexestPony> alexxm IshBestPony is not an ass
<TheGir979> Um, last night I was allowed to put YT links. What's wrong with them?
<Kandarihu> Evangelion-makes-nice-brainbleach/10
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Salvador/Dali
<LunaTheBeloved> Still no ping but alrgiht
<RaveBrony> Intriguing/10
<Apokalipse> On a scale of 1 to pretty cool this movie was pretty cool
<twilight_sprinkler> Princess_Saturn: build something pony-related
<TheMaster> the moral of the story is to communicate with people
<alexxm> that was werid
<Acleps> Midnight_Fyre: :D
<LunaTheBeloved> Cout to 5 and say LTB
<Wrek> 05needs more roger waters
<Kammerjunk> o u
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01or maybe an induction heater
<CCCP> TheGir979: not during streams
<Randomiser> Are these films being showed again later? Because I kind of wanted to see this one but I couldn't catch it.
<DRUNKOWN> Young Pink
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hard to tell what's going on / 10
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkler: already doing that, hun; i built a convention
<TheMaster> you shouldn't build a wall around yourself or a giant ass will yell at you and tear it down
<SirGanjalf> Music & Animations/10
<LordDerpington> I need some time to let it sink in, but my overall impression is that it was excellent.
<Kammerjunk> Uhh... What comes after 3?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> LTB
<ScootaBlues> The film is a whole bunch of pretentious yet surprisingly obvious metaphorical allegories for sex and self destruction, but the music is incredible, and the animation is fantastic.
<GilDash> I understood absolutely none of that. :D
<twilight_sprinkler> Princess_Saturn: ah, but does the convention have SCIENCE?
<TheGir979> But there's always a stream.... -_-
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Not during an official stream, TheGir979
<LunaTheBeloved> Awesome
<MrSnugglewoods> relative of pinkie pie?

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And yeah, where's my sketch >: (
<ScootaChicken> MaidSurge: Ah, fair enough. Yeah, I guess it's because of how varied Pink Floyd's music tends to be, I mean Wish You Were Here is a fairly standard acoustic ballad, whilst Shine on You Crazy Diamond is a weird proggy bluesy kind of thing and ABITW Part 2 and Money are borderline Funk.

*PrincessLuna pokes TheRainbowDash
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Crap, I'll be right back~

<TheRainbowDash> PrincessLuna: Yes?

<RX-78-SweetieBot> ScootaChicken: no, I was refering to princessLuna as a her
<ScootaChicken> Acleps: You can be the lead guitarist then, whilst I can solo, I'm far more comfortable with rhythm work.
<CCCP> daww pyrocatboy

<PONY> How many of you guys have wasted the whole week in here btw?
<Kammerjunk> I thought otakon was in #bronystateregulars, actually.
<MysteryPony> What up CCCP!
*PrincessLuna hugs Midnight_Fyre
<ScootaChicken> The thing is though, Wrek, banning people for that might not be the best idea, given that this isn't stated in the rules and someone could just come into the chat, make an otashipping joke and get banned without knowing it's a ban offense.
<CCCP> :$ brb\
<MrSnugglewoods> anyone up for G4-ponies the live-action?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> he sometimes is
<Kandarihu> I was tired of everyone picking on him. Thanks for standing up for him.

<twilight_sprinkler> ScootaChicken: well 30 mins isnt a big deal either
<GilDash> PONY: I don't consider it wasted as such though. ;)
<MysteryPony> MrSnugglewoods: you should see my Fluttershy cosplay!
<Nyria> So what movie is this?~
<Evo_Kaer> MrSnugglewoods: no I dont :P
*PrincessLuna pokes GilDash
<ScootaChicken> twilight_sprinkler: It's not, but it does seem a bit unfair.
<PONY> ScootaChicken, if Wrek wouldn't warn everypony he wants to ban, there would be nopony left here on the chat.
*GilDash hugs PrincessLuna.
<Wrek> 05ScootaChicken: give it time. sicne kicks and tellign people doesnt work. my hand is forced. besides if people actualyl read their kick messages for once alot of shitstrom could have been avoided.
<MrSnugglewoods> u know, that live ation, when the G4 ponies are one a scen and does things
<Wrek> 05which is also im not extreme as in appeal-bans or 1 hour plus. but 30 minutes.
<PrincessLuna> MrSnugglewoods: You mean all of S1+S2?
<twilight_sprinkler> Scoot-Scootaloo: hes been saying it for a while tho, but in a way it can be unfair, but at the same time 30 mins isnt a big deal
<Evo_Kaer> MrSnugglewoods: should I really go to youtube and search for it...
<CCCP> Wrek: why do you need to ban people in the first place?
<twilight_sprinkler> woooops wrong ping
<RaveBrony> I remember MY first kick from Wrek.... it said "You have been kicked....for having low DPS" :D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I know ;_;
<MrSnugglewoods> nah, you know. the infamous live action of G4 ponies?
<diddutz> Kammerjunk: Oh, right they swapped them... well I wouldn't want to miss the D too :D
<twilight_sprinkler> Scoot-Scootaloo: sorry wrong ping, no sleep this week > : (
<TheRainbowDash> CCCP: It is neccassary, to you know, regulate the chat.:P
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01WHICH WAY IS NORWEGIAN?

<ScootaChicken> Wrek: Fair enough.
<Apokalipse> Hai

<Airpuff> Princess_Saturn: wat? xD
<RaveBrony> Ive had alot of silly kicks
<Kammerjunk> RaveBrony: Aye, I was kicked for mentioning Deus Ex: Invisible War when nopony asked what game Wrek was playing. I deserved it wholely.
<Evo_Kaer> MrSnugglewoods: I remember the G3 one
<Wrek> 05CCCP: because they keep herassing otakon with it. sure it may be a joke. and be precieved as fun. but when he asks you to stop adn you dont it per automatics becomes an offence.
<twilight_sprinkler> Scoot-Scootaloo: as i accidently told the other scoot, hes been saying it for a while tho, but in a way it can be unfair, but at the same time 30 mins isnt a big deal
<RaveBrony> Kammerjunk: Oh, haha :D
<twilight_sprinkler> GAHG
<twilight_sprinkler> WHAT THE HELL
<ScootaChicken> Scoot-Scootaloo: I'm not.
<twilight_sprinkler> AGAIN

<Evo_Kaer> MrSnugglewoods: I turned of the audio and played good pony music in the background: AWESOME
<CCCP> Wrek: oh okay :)
<GilDash> pikorar: Yo, how are you doing?
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Dashie.
<PrincessLuna> In all fairness, he is a moderator and ultimately his decision stands. If it was an unfair judgement let the mods deal with it
