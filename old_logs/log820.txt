<Kandarihu> As far as I'm concerned, the outcome of the Secret Santa game is that I gifted someone the Deus Ex collection, and I didn't really get anything meaningful in return.
<KrazyNoobs> One of the conventions I attended here in Australia had a Secret Santa activity with only shirts... everyone brought a shirt (had to be new and never worn), I submitted a Pinkieception Shirt, and got a G3 Shirt in return, as a joke. I found it quite funny, and the people there gave me a free AU Bronies T-Shirt because of it. LOL
<Kandarihu> KrazyNoobs, lol

<KrazyNoobs> ouo: Also, in Fiji, trespassors to the island, such as different races (about 80 years ago) would capture them and keep them in the barn, then cooking them afterward and eating them (FIJI barns were not the classic design, they were referred to as barns, they are just small buildings made of metal.

<Kandarihu> KrazyNoobs is trying to substantiate the Racist Barn meme by using historical uses of barns by slavers, in order to create the image of a historical precedant for a meme that started 3 days ago.
<KrazyNoobs> btw, Season 3 Episode 9 has been leaked already.
<Bronysith> KrazyNoobs: pm it to me

<aniderp|bestfruitcak> i thought you tried to call him..
<DerpyMuffins> Why are you called Saturn Saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01apparently, he's "rubbish at answering [his] phone"
<Lightning_Wing> i think its an earthbound joke

<fluffle> aturnalia is a festival of light leading to the winter solstice, with the abundant presence of candles symbolizing the quest for knowledge and truth.[5] The renewal of light and the coming of the new year was celebrated in the later Roman Empire at the Dies Natalis of Sol Invictus, the "Birthday of the Unconquerable Sun," on December 25.[6]
<DerpyMuffins> Used to?
<Lightning_Wing> is it going to be nothing but yull log burning or is a christmas story going to come on eventualy?
<Saturn> 08,01and my furry character's species was a comet moth
<ouo> http://i1.minus.com/ibdPBpWzipIRep.jpg
<Saturn> 08,01and a comet moth is a big bright yellow moth, in family Saturniidae
<Saturn> 08,01so i decided to call him Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01and it just stuck
<cachi01> yay
<Kandarihu> cachi01, if you're wanting to see steam games for $2.55 or less, be sure to keep an eye out for games that are normally $9.99 or less and watch them on the sale like a hawk. You never know when one of them might go -75%
<Saturn> 08,01http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Argema_mittrei_01.JPG <-- a comet moth
<cachi01> Kandarihu: true dat. i'll be checking the indie section
<Saturn> 08,01fluffle: so what you should be saying today is "felix diem natalis sol invictus!"
<ouo> Saturn, let it bring griffins to us
<Saturn> 08,01because today is the Birthday of the Unconquerable Sun
<Saturn> 08,01which is preceded by Saturnalia
<cachi01> oh great audiosurf is just 2.50 =D

<CrystalPhoenix> Good thing Phase4 doesn't have any kids http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1356446772140.jpg
<Saturn> 08,01i want kids :(
<cachi01> dat 4chan leech
<KrazyNoobs> I'm back, my internet disconnected for 5 mins
<Lightning_Wing> that sucks
<Lightning_Wing> any idea why it disconnected?
<Saturn> 08,01CrystalPhoenix: i had my first computer when i was 4. it was an Intertec Superbrain made in 1979 that didn't have a graphical interface at all, and ran CP/M as an operating system
<Saturn> 08,01i learned to program wehn i was 8
<KrazyNoobs> Who here has read Season 3 Episode 11 Description (DONT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT, JUST WONDERING. No spoilers here, please)
<ouo> so
<KrazyNoobs> Saturn: You learned to program when you were 8? Dayum, what was it in?
<ouo> where the fuck cider truck was?
<KrazyNoobs> I learned C++ when I was 12, but 8 years of age? That's amazing!
<cachi01> i can count to potato
<KrazyNoobs> cachi01: prove it. >:)
<cachi01> 1
<cachi01> 3
<cachi01> 91
<cachi01> potato
<cachi01> yay
<KrazyNoobs> :O
<Saturn> 08,01KrazyNoobs: QBASIC
<KrazyNoobs> :D
<ouo> challenge accepted
<Saturn> 08,01when i was 12, i learned Python and C
<KrazyNoobs> Saturn: Is that like Visual Basic?
<Saturn> 08,01KrazyNoobs: a bit, but not as powerful/visual
<DocSane> Happy Christmas, everyone.
<cachi01> happy xmas DocSane :)
<Saturn> 08,01bear in mind that at this point, i still used a CLI-only based system
<Simon> I was bored, so I drew Santa http://imgur.com/vsUps
<KrazyNoobs> Visual Basic 6.0, I started to learn when I was around 10, but I never got too much into it. I played around with it a bit, but I couldn't actually consider myself an expert at it (at the time)
<KrazyNoobs> I learned and loved C++ at 12.
<ouo> i learned a potato
<cachi01> Saintuhg Kluoz pls
<DocSane> All set for the most unproductive week on the calendar? aka The week between Christmas and New Year's?
<KrazyNoobs> But yeah, I always have Visual Basic 6.0 pinned to my task bar, so that if I needed to write any small programs to solve a problem (math, duh), it would be easily accessible.
<cachi01> eeyup
<KrazyNoobs> Really easy to write small programs in with power, but if it is just something simple with math that would take forever to write on paper, I use Python.

<cachi01> yes it is
<Punkie_Pue> a ;lot of detail though.
<pony_1242> i hope that lyra dosent have a hole in its flank
<cachi01> i hope it does
<cachi01> i always wanted lyra socks
<Punkie_Pue> lol http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/mowza2k2/Merch/RainbowDashToeSocks.jpg
<WindWyr> I want those socks
<WindWyr> *_*
<kidzrul732> Hey bronies! I got Rhythem Heaven Fever for christmas!
<cachi01> kidzrul732: nice!
<cachi01> awesome game :)
<cachi01> and merry xmas
<kidzrul732> I even got Family Guy back to the multiverse and Ted Unrated version on DVD
<Punkie_Pue> I saw them at a hot topic in nh
<killerpony7733> I got a turtle beach x12 headset so yep. Funny story though how i was originally mean't to get it though but got it taken away and cheated to first get on christmas night
<DerpyMuffins> Kids are spoiled.....
<Punkie_Pue> ^
<cachi01> brb playing the unfinished swan :3
<fluffle> Far Over the Misty Mountains Cold:P
<killerpony7733> DerpyMuffins Wut? i'm 18. I got the money to buy it. Yet i was tricked by my mom who bought it instead of me doing it myself cause i wanted a new one.
<DerpyMuffins> I said KIDS were spoiled
<killerpony7733> Aaaah
<kidzrul732> I also got Regular Show toys
<GilDash> They're not all spoiled...
<DerpyMuffins> I'm expected to get my little sister something......
<DerpyMuffins> I don't know what to get her
<GilDash> A lot of them are though, yeah...
<killerpony7733> DerpyMuffins I know the feel. I was forced to buy things and all that.
<DerpyMuffins> Yea, but I want to get her something nice
<DerpyMuffins> It is Christmas
<CrystalPhoenix> golly
<CrystalPhoenix> I just watched a recording of a christmas that was before my time
<DerpyMuffins> It's a Wonderful life?
<CrystalPhoenix> It was like the first christmas of my brother
<CrystalPhoenix> it felt....odd
<GilDash> I hate figuring out what everyone in my family wants. Absolutely none of us ever know what we want. XD
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<WindWyr> That's like my family xD
<DerpyMuffins> I'd hate to do this...
<GilDash> I got my Nanna a book on ancient Egypt last Christmas. 'Twas a bottle of vodka this Christmas...
<DerpyMuffins> Vodka+eggnog=Best Christmas
<killerpony7733> GilDash That's why i usually say to just make it so easy and simple. Give me money then i can use it on things i may end up wanting or needing at some point. Instead of taking a shot at just buying something of a either low medium or high price that can backfire which i just don't need.
<DerpyMuffins> That's why I love Chinese new years
<DerpyMuffins> All you get is money
<GilDash> killerpony7733: That's what I say as well to make it simple for people. Chances are I won't even spend it until later anyway (I've actually got money from 3 years ago still saved). The problem is, not everyone agrees with giving money as a gift.
<DerpyMuffins> I'd want money for a gift
<GilDash> To be honest, I'm happy with anything you give me. Even joke presents can be quite funny sometimes. :D
<DerpyMuffins> All I got was gas money for Christmas
<killerpony7733> GilDash Yeah but most in the family does not agree and insist on being stubborn and having to use alot of money on things that i may not need or want. My dad knows this and has given me actual money with the note attached saying he wants me to use it well. My dad understands me but the rest of the family? nope
<Background_Pony> If everyone gave each other money; everyone would just about break even. XD
<Ninjazz> I'm pretty sure it's the thought that counts.
<Punkie_Pue> Who wants money when you can get a http://www.amazon.com/ThinkGeek-USB-Pet-Rock/dp/B003DOD0TI
<Background_Pony> I'd put the money in an elaborate puzzle box. Tehehe
<GilDash> killerpony7733: I know, right? I'd rather someone give me, say, a £10 rather than spend £30 on a huge gift for me. Honestly, sometimes I prefer the smaller gifts anyway.
<Punkie_Pue> lol unicorn meat http://www.amazon.com/ThinkGeek-Canned-Unicorn-Meat/dp/B004CRYE2C/ref=pd_sim_t_1
<fluffle> :'(
<DocSane> I really only got one joke pony gift this year.
<fluffle> Twilight nooo
<Punkie_Pue> I contacted the seller, they assured me it was a background unicorn.
<DerpyMuffins> DINKY NOOOOOO
<killerpony7733> GilDash Yep that too. But atleast though my big sister and mom bought a gift card with money for a game store which is honestly just as good tbh. But else i just try and keep pushing it saying it's stupid and i want to make it simple for them. But yeah it's a very pointless struggle alot of the time.
<DerpyMuffins> LYRA YOU WERE SO YOUNG!
<DerpyMuffins> Not too crazy about Sombra
<DerpyMuffins> Trixie meat.....
<DerpyMuffins> Hmmm
<Punkie_Pue> interesting thought...
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Problem I have with gift cards? You can only spend them in one place (I guarantee I can find it cheaper elsewhere). It has no real world value and can't be transferred (if there's nothing you want in that shop you can't get the money back). It will eventually expire (if you don't spend it in time it becomes worthless).
<GilDash> I sound like such an ass, debating presents. XD
<DerpyMuffins> Better than tech talk last night
<killerpony7733> GilDash Well the good ting is i always spend some money at that store anyway so i keep the said amount of time before expiring constantly reset :P
<GilDash> killerpony7733: That's fair enough. If you gave me a gift card for the local garden centre though... like, lulwat?
<killerpony7733> GilDash Yeah that would be silly.
<GilDash> You know... I can't think of a single thing I'd buy in a garden centre. Doesn't help that this house doesn't have any gardens...
<Punkie_Pue> how about a spade?
<GilDash> ... Not going to help with concrete. XD
<Punkie_Pue> Maybe not.
<GilDash> Maybe I could buy a pressure hose? That's good for cleaning concrete, right?
<Punkie_Pue> A pressure hose?
<Punkie_Pue> YOu mean like a power washer?
<GilDash> Aye, like a power washer.
<Punkie_Pue> yeah, that a good idea.
<GilDash> Although this is all achedemic. I'm not going anywhere near a garden centre unless I can help it. XD
<Punkie_Pue> Does anyone else have issues withs steam going offline?
<Vivix> though with giftcards, getting it cheaper elsewhere isn't important, as it's free for you anyway, and you can get mall-wide giftcards
<GilDash> Then in that case you've got to go to a specific mall. Also, if we're going that way, money you get given is technically free to you as well.
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> and no not specific mall, it's cooperation thing-
<Vivix> can't remember what mine's called, but it's a list of various shops that take that type
<Vivix> like "This mall + these shops"
<GilDash> Not sure we have anything like that in the UK. Or, at least, I've not heard of it and never bothered checking.
<Vivix> I never heard about it until I got it
<jcelios> MEEEEEEERRRRRYYYY CHRISTMAS!
<GilDash> Merry Christmas to you too! :)
<jcelios> :)
<GilDash> Honestly, I am really struggling to type Christmas for some reason. :S
<Vivix> almost always become chirstmas to me
<GilDash> I dunno... my mind just kind of becomes blank.
<GilDash> It's like I've really got to focus on typing that one word. XD
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> Is odd yeah
<jcelios> The fire of friendship lives in our heartsAs long as it burns we cannot drift apartThough quarrels arise, their numbers are fewLaughter and singing will see us through (will see us through)We are a circle of pony friendsA circle of friends we'll be to the very end
<otakon> okey dokey all
<GilDash> jcelios: Is that from somewhere?
<otakon> have to disconnect my monitor for travel
<otakon> so I'll brb on ipod shortly
<jcelios> GilDash: From Hearth's Warming Eve episode :)
<otakon> actually scratch that
<otakon> I'll be leaving
<otakon> so goodbye all, take care and have a merry Christmas )
<GilDash> otakon: See ya! :)
<otakon> :)
<Vivix> goodbye, have fun
<GilDash> jcelios: I thought it might be.
<GilDash> We need to get otakon a fleet for Christmas.
<Vivix> I never got into that song, It was too hard to sing along-
<Arcium> ! http://www.bronystate.net/theater/fluttershy/
<Arcium> whops
<Arcium> sorry
<Arcium> xD
<Vivix> \001ACTION laughs\001
<jcelios> Twilight Sparke is best theater :$
<Randomnerd> Hey everyone.
<Vivix> Hiya
<Ninjazz> Okay. Rarity can be best pony then.
<Randomnerd> Rarity is least understood pony.
<Vivix> Rarity is best mare
<Ninjazz> Oh I know right.
<Ninjazz> Indeed!
<Randomnerd> It's a contradiction -in order to be generous, she needs stuff to give.
<Vivix> yeah
<Randomnerd> So she must be acquisitive.
<Vivix> and she's very emotionally generous too
<Vivix> I don't have trouble seeing her element-
<Randomnerd> Sorry, I'm sure this was all discussed before I came in.
<Arcium> Vivix: Thats what i mean :D
<GilDash> You can certainly say that Rarity has earnt her namesake.
<CrystalPhoenix> Double Rainboom teaser everyone
<Randomnerd> -or has been discussed to death since S1.E2. XD
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Vivix> True, the general consensus is fine now
<Randomnerd> Double Rainboom? What does it mean?
<CrystalPhoenix> Randomnerd, first ever fan made episode based on MLP FiM
<Vivix> Oh god! O h man!
<Vivix> Oh, right
<Vivix> I-- probably won't watch it
<CrystalPhoenix> I might
<Randomnerd> Thank you, CrystalPhoenix.
<GilDash> Eh, why not?
<Vivix> Rarely watch fandmade things
<CrystalPhoenix> at least it'll be better than Dusk Dawn
<CrystalPhoenix> urgh
<Randomnerd> I was being silly, but in truth, I didn't know what it was, so thanks.
<Vivix> that it will be
<Arcium> Whats the difference between the channels on bronystate?
<Vivix> just the chat, during certain events like episode stream
<Sundaysmile> Twilight Chat is best chat
<Arcium> Vivix: Thnx!
<Ninjazz> That's what the promise. They delayed to early 2013 instead of this year's fall so we can at least assume it's going to be quality.
<CrystalPhoenix> http://youtu.be/dYQTEW6GYU8
<Arcium> Fluttershy chat is best chat :D
<CrystalPhoenix> for those curious about Sonic Rainboom
<Vivix> They're very talented animators, and I think it will be great, but I most likely won't see it
*Randomnerd goes to war against Sundaysmile carrying a banner with three Butterflies on it.
<CrystalPhoenix> and from what I've seen, the animation aren't as show accurate as the director claims it to be
*Vivix waves Fluttershy banner
<CrystalPhoenix> it's good, great even but still not exactly like the show
<Vivix> well they're all animation students, right?
<CrystalPhoenix> the voice, I could get use to that
<GilDash> I want to know what the VAs are going to be like.
<CrystalPhoenix> Vivix, I suppose so
<Vivix> the animators on mlp have very long experience
<Vivix> well, the seniors do
<Randomnerd> PURGE THE INFIDELS! That is.... if you don't mind....
<Vivix> Randomnerd's purge was succesful
<Vivix> downside: it killed the chat
<Randomnerd> lol
<Randomnerd> This is why we can't have nice things.
<CrystalPhoenix> welp time to go back to killing angels
<CrystalPhoenix> in a suggestive way
<thelonecubone> Good luck
<Arcium> Byeee :P (i have been in this chat about 4 times today xD )
<jcelios> mfw ep11 synopsis :O

<kidzrul732> Hey bronies I'm sad because I never got any ponies for christmas :(
<thelonecubone> Hi Saturn :)
<jcelios> Saturn: It'll just be like good ol' classic Dr. Who
<DocSane> Saturn: Well, you have 15 minutes to solve it.
<DocSane> Saturn: Just reverse the polarity of the neutron flow. That'll solve whatever ails it.
<jcelios> but but... neutrons are neutral they have no polarity!
<Saturn> 08,01okay, if you refresh your stream, you should see the bbc news
<Vivix> screw physics, hit it and kick it
<Saturn> 08,01let me know if it's working
<jcelios> seems to be
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> yup
<CrystalPhoenix> I can see pictures
<Saturn> 08,01sound?
<jcelios> black and white, but sound and video
<Saturn> 08,01eccellent
<Vivix> last time I got blackandwhite instead of colour was ntsc vs pal etc
<Vivix> though that was over 10 years ago
<Saturn> 08,01i've tried that, actually
<Saturn> 08,01still didn't work
<Vivix> hm, I'm out of ideas
<jcelios> he could try streaming in antimatter instead of matter
<GilDash> It's the Queen!
<Vivix> well honestly, last time I got black and white without it being an issue, I was running and old xbox into my pedalboard and into a tv
<Vivix> digital tv cut the signal if I applied too much noise-
<Saturn> 08,01and we have colour.
<Vivix> boom
<Vivix> what was it?
<Jmo> How long till it's on?
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> dat jaymoo

<Vivix> yeah
<Jmo> LOL RAT7
<Vivix> I don't game, but I do enjoy how that mouse feels
<Vivix> well, as in, I play games, but not much
<Jmo> Isn't that the shitty cyborg mouse
<Vivix> It's lovely ;__;
<Jmo> That mouse is horrid
*Vivix hugs it
<Jmo> Whoever made it should feel bad for coming up with such an ugly and horrible design.
<jcelios> my opinion is fact
<Vivix> I had a Razer before then, but the RMB kinda started dying
<Vivix> and the MMB was dead
<DaringDerpy> :)
<DaringDerpy> only 11 viewers
<Deacon> well, looks odd, but as long as it feels comfortable, k
<Vivix> yeah, I can change parts on it and such
<DaringDerpy> thanks, Saturn!
<Vivix> as a gear whore, I like that
<Jmo> I will wreck your mouse :I
*Vivix licks Jmo's mouse
<Jmo> Don't you lick my mouse.

<Stormy> -.-
<Stormy> anyways
<Stormy> Merry Christmas :)
<Conyst> Happy Hearth's Warming everypony
<DaringDerpy> hello Conyst :)
<Deacon> lali-ho Conyst
*Conyst hugs DaringDerpy Deacon
<SirGanjalf> suddenly LotR
*Deacon huggles back :3
<Conyst> LOtR is always good
<Afflict> How's everyone doing?
<SirGanjalf> and i could swear i've seen Dancing with the Stars here, a couple of minutes before
<Neotyguy40> Pretty good
<Conyst> Dancing with stars is always difficult. You can manage only one step before you burn up.
<Conyst> This is the most silent I have ever seen Bronystate.
<Deacon> well it is chrsitmas
<Afflict> I was thinking about trying to come up with another challenge for Spyro. Do you think anyone cares about them anymore?
<ScootaChicken> tfw I'm watching this at the exact same time on the exact same channel.
<ScootaChicken> Film4 ftw
<ScootaChicken> UK TV uber alles.
<Conyst> nice ScootaChicken
<Stormy> I might if I had enough time for one
<Conyst> I watch the Extended edition about twice a year
<Neotyguy40> Challenge?
<Afflict> Neo, http://www.spyroforum.com/forum-spyro-contests.html
<Deacon> I still need to finish watching all of them, but procastionation -_-
<Neotyguy40> dafuq
<Neotyguy40> Why is the forum still open?
<Stormy> because I didn't have time to draw anything
<Neotyguy40> k
<Stormy> I'm kind of sad about it actually
<Stormy> but oh well
<Stormy> Next year I won't have finals and stuff anymore at this time of year
<Stormy> so hopefully it'll happen
<Afflict> You're sad that no one does them anymore?
<Stormy> Unless I get kicked out for being too old by then
<Stormy> :P
<Conyst> watch the extended version RotK with the actor's commentary on tis hilarious
<ScootaChicken> Does anyone know where VioletVanilla is? I really want to get her a Christmas present, I'll get her ANYTHING, she just has to ask.
<ScootaChicken> ANYTHING.
<Stormy> I'm sad I didn't have time to draw anything for the Christmas page
<ScootaChicken> ANYTH-ohai emangamer
<SpeccyRush> lel
<Lil_B> ScootaChicken her PC blew up
<Stormy> usually the forums are down for Christmas
<Conyst> Anything you say
<Lil_B> ScootaChicken seriously, it broke since than she couldn't be able to be here
<Lil_B> then*
<Stormy> and SR and I put up a Spyroy Chrismas picture with javascript snow and stuff
<ScootaChicken> Lil_B: Yeah I know, I just felt like taking the oppurtunity to bust out an in joke.
<Afflict> oh :(
<Jmo> O U so silleh.
<Lil_B> ScootaChicken you mean that Vivi is best Pony? :3
<ScootaChicken> No she's not.
<ScootaChicken> Splash zone is best pony.
<ScootaChicken> Also, #jezuzbday2k12yolo
<Jmo> Ayo.
<Afflict> Why was it always down for christmas?
<Stormy> just a tradition
<DaringDerpy> my birthday
<Stormy> so people would spend time with their families instead of posting on forums
<Sundaysmile> Merry Xmas to all!
<Deacon> yo Sundaysmile ScootaChicken emangamer!
<Sundaysmile> And good evening too all
<DaringDerpy> hi Sundaysmile :)
<Afflict> ah ok
<SirGanjalf> happy holidays Sundaysmile
<Stormy> we've been doing it since like what, '08?
<Stormy> I think '08
<Conyst> Hello Sundaysmile
<Sundaysmile> Is it insane coincidence that my tv has this playing in the other room?
<Vivix> he's streaming from tv
<Pikachu> Hey bronies/ponies! :) Merry Xmas!
<Deacon> so...anyone read any good books lately, trying to get something on itunes, and it's ben awhile since I read anything
<Conyst> Saruman is like I hate when he does that
<Vivix> they sell books on itunes?
<Sundaysmile> that makes me feel less paranoid, thanks Vivix
<Vivix> Hehe, let the paranoia feed
<Neotyguy40> It was a 3 year tradition
<Neotyguy40> Nice
<SirGanjalf> a wild ad appears
<Conyst> every single time we have a get together he calls the eagles so he can leave
<Sundaysmile> AH GOD
<Sundaysmile> FURBY! KILL IT!
<thelonecubone> SirGanjalf: Get adblock +
<Conyst> Can't ride a horse out like a normal wizard
<SirGanjalf> thelonecubone: i meant TV ad
<thelonecubone> SirGanjalf: oh, :P
<Sundaysmile> thelonecubone - you should be seeing ads too.....
<thelonecubone> well, i'm not looking at stream atm
<thelonecubone> helping someone atm
<Sundaysmile> dawwww
*Conyst wishes they had adblock+ for tv
<Deacon> but that's where tv stations get their money from
<Sundaysmile> that and the companies who pay them to host their shows....
<Vivix> what
<Vivix> no other way around
<Vivix> tv pays for the ability to air shows
<Sundaysmile> well depends on the show :P
<Vivix> unless the show is made by them, then they pay the staff who made it
<Vivix> commercials pay to get on tv
<Stormy> must've been '07 then
<Sundaysmile> So if I say that i have a show to air, they'll air it?
<Conyst> DISASTER YOUR TEARING ME APART
<Stormy> Because I drew 3 pictures
<Stormy> And one got reused one year
<Vivix> no, but if it's a show they believe in, believe in your pitch
<Vivix> they'll buy it
<Conyst> Forgot to do the electricity
<Conyst> wat was that
<Stormy> and the forum was founded in '06
<RaveBrony> Hello and Merry Christmas, everypony! :)
<Sundaysmile> merry xmas ravebrony
<Stormy> so that's every year except first that we've done it
<Stormy> aw :(
<Sundaysmile> have a good one so far?
<Lil_B> Sundaysmile basicly, if they think that you make a Show, that will get people to watch their Channel so they can get advertising money, because componies know that a lot of people watch this channel, than they will buy your Show you offer them
<Dark92Enigma> hi RaveBrony! :) Merry Christmas!
<Dark92Enigma> BILBO!
<RaveBrony> Sundaysmile: You bet! :3
<RaveBrony> Dark92Enigma: :$
<Sundaysmile> I feel educated for someone who doesn't watch tv now
<Sundaysmile> thank you bronystate
<Vivix> I'm not sure how a tv show generates profit though, I think that's merchendise isn't it?
<Vivix> they don't get admoney, right? Only staff pay and royalties?
<Sundaysmile> I'd imagine they'd get a cut
<Sundaysmile> but like you said
<Sundaysmile> probably from advertising the merchandise
<Vivix> I'm not sure- I know simpsons get a rerun pay, and if you have origina lcharacter in that episode you get character pay or writer pay-
<Vivix> yeah
<RaveBrony> :o
<Dark92Enigma> What does TUS mean?
<Beefchief> Woof
<Mike|Explosives> OH MY LORD OF THE RINGS
<SirGanjalf> "Mario! Marioooooooo!" :P

<Bronysith> Mike|Explosives: kill yourself
<SirGanjalf> remember times whe PS3 had no games?
<SirGanjalf> *when
<Mike|Explosives> SirGanjalf: It never has.
<Conyst> Also get Gravity Rush it is an excellent game.
<Conyst> I know this from playing it.
<Mike|Explosives> I really wonder if anyone knows what I'm talking about.
<Sundaysmile> one does not simply <insert comment here> into Mordor
<Conyst> Take pie into Mordor
<SirGanjalf> One does not simply dash through the snow into Mordor.
<SirGanjalf> Which means no presents for Orcs:;(
<SirGanjalf> *:'(
<jcelios> One does not simply trot into Mordor.
<SirGanjalf> oh mai
<Conyst> One does not simply wear a hat into Mordor.
<jcelios> One must ROCK \m/ INTO MORDOR!
<Ninjazz> Where was Gondor when one didn't simply walk into Morder?
<Kimori1> Hey Stormy, Merry Christmas :)
<Mike|Explosives> Jcelios: At that exact moment, a prog metal riff played in my head.
<SirGanjalf> inb4 Gimli SMASH
<Conyst> Where was Gondor when Gimli broke his axe?
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<Sundaysmile> Gimli gives no fucks
<Sundaysmile> he finds a bigger hammer and tries again
<jcelios> Where was drums in the deep when one does not simply precious?
<DaringDerpy> apply magma
<Conyst> Gimli use Moljnir on it.
<SirGanjalf> Not even Banhammer can destroy the Ring
<Saturn> 08,01just a sec, need to swap this thing over
<Sundaysmile> np
<Mike|Explosives> noooooo
<Conyst> When Sauron takes back what is his there will be a big party.

<virtannia> ScootaChicken: da yaoi
<cachi01> ScootaChicken: LL is real 2401
<texasboykc09> hi stream
<stream> hi texasboykc09
<texasboykc09> how are you cachi01
<Dark92Enigma> I've heard the Hobbit is an awesome film. Gotta watch it
<cachi01> texasboykc09: lol
<Afflict> oh cool, have you played them yet?
<cachi01> Dark92Enigma: it is :3
<Neotyguy40> I've played Nintendo Land, it's not bad
<Neotyguy40> The games are better than the Wii Sports games the first Wii had
<Afflict> I should hope so :P
<Dark_Horst> In The Fellowship of the Ring, both the novel and the film, Gandalf claimed to be the wielder of the Flame of Anor. Many people think this means the Elvish Ring of Power he has (Narya, the Ring of Fire), but many also wonder why he would reveal this secret to such a powerful enemy. No one knows what he really meant by the Flame of Anor.
<Neotyguy40> Nintendo also made it a lot more internet orientated like the 360 and PS3
<Dark_Horst> It is interesting to note that Minas Tirith was formerly known as Minas Anor, or "Tower of the Sun." This could suggest that the Flame of Anor is the light of the Sun - an ancient symbol of the one omnipotent being, Ilúvatar. As a Maia and a wizard charged with aiding the peoples of Middle Earth in the battle against evil, it's possible that Gandalf's powers are linked to the power of the sun and given by Ilúvatar himself. This seems
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<Conyst> He is very sad about the cat
<Dark_Horst> the more you know
<Conyst> woot IT crowd
<Lil_B> welll... dat Psy
<Kimori> did you have to make an account
<soulrider95> ello everyone
*Conyst upgrades tea to LotR
<Neotyguy40> I don't think I "had to"
<Conyst> hello soulrider95
<Neotyguy40> but I did
<cachi01> you ar drunk gimli, go home
<Lil_B> hi soulrider95
<Neotyguy40> It actually divides userspaces into different logins, sort of like a computer with multiple users
<cachi01> go home frodo, you are high
<Neotyguy40> So each person has a different save, differen't data, etc.
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: you were truncated at "this seem", hun
<Stormy> that's what the PS3 does
<Conyst> We must sing you the doom song
<Dark_Horst> yes gimli, you do
<Stormy> Not sure about the 360
<virtannia> chat needs more of something
<Stormy> Previous Wii had nothing like that though
<cachi01> oi aragorn speaks fancy
<Neotyguy40> Yea
<Saturn> 08,01chat needs more naked..
<virtannia> Saturn: O U
<Conyst> and you cannot get out
<Lil_B> Saturn but... I'm already :/
<Neotyguy40> You could put some data in individual Miis, like Wii Sports statistics
<Afflict> Yeah that's what the ps3 does
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst I just got a Bundeswher Ad...
<Neotyguy40> But it doesn't let you do anything else
<Dark_Horst> This seems supported by the fact that most of Gandalf's wizardly powers have something to do with blinding white light.
<Saturn> 08,01naked germans are best germans.
<Dark_Horst> there'S the rest
*Saturn 08,01is slightly drunk
<Lil_B> xD
<thelonecubone> Lil_B: I want you to go streaking in the streets then
<Neotyguy40> The Wii U is much more like PSN actually
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: y u no adblock
<Dark_Horst> but i think they might be trying to tell us something
<Conyst> only slightly Saturn? I don't believe you.
<Dark_Horst> lyrics drop
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst I have Adhunter, but I just can't find the Block-Rules for U-Stream :(
<Dark_Horst> weird
<Dark_Horst> i installed adblock plus
<Saturn> 08,01galadriel's a whore
<Afflict> cool
<Saturn> 08,01galadriel's a whore
<Dark_Horst> does everything by itself
<ShizuKlaus> 13easylist
<Saturn> 08,01la la la la la
<Dark_Horst> didnt need any configuration
<Saturn> 08,01galadriel's a whore
<ShizuKlaus> 13just subscribe to easylist, it stays updated
<Stormy> I heard that Nintendo announced something about the updates
<Neotyguy40> They also got rid of the friend codes
*Saturn 08,01slutshaming
<Neotyguy40> Yea
<Neotyguy40> The updates take forever to download
<Stormy> like supposedly they take forever right out of the box
<Neotyguy40> Yea.
<Dark_Horst> nice skirt, legolas
<Neotyguy40> At least 2 hours
<Stormy> So if you bought it for someone as a gift you should unbox it, install the updates, and then repackage
<Stormy> Oh wow
<Saturn> 08,01we're watching swan lake ehre
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma yes, Adblock does everything by Itself, Adhunter can do the same, except you have to find the Rules yourself :(
<Neotyguy40> And that's just the main update
<Stormy> well hopefully they'll start packaging them with those updates preinstalled ._.
<soulrider95> lets see, this is fellowship of the ring correct?
<Saturn> 08,01my mother: "is he going for hunting?"
<Conyst> Dark_Horst: Have you read DM of the Rings?
<Saturn> 08,01my brother: "not in those tights he's not"
<Neotyguy40> There are other smaller updates when you run the channels that take a few minutes
<Dark_Horst> Conyst: dont think i have
<Neotyguy40> I should see if it will run Gamecube games
<Lil_B> fun-Trivia, IE 9 has something Similar as Adblock Plus Implemented, Easylist is available for this too, just look through the Options and enjoy Ad-free IE9
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: how does elf with pitcher translate to hunting?=
<Kimori> I thought it couldnt
<cachi01> ewwwww IE
<Neotyguy40> It's supposedly backwards compatible with the Wii, and there is a Wii menu available.
<Kimori> since theres no way to plugin your controllers
<Neotyguy40> Yea
<Neotyguy40> That's what I'm wondering about
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: i was talking about Swan Lake, which is a ballet
<Kimori> it really sucks
<Dark_Horst> ah
<Saturn> 08,01so they're all wearing tights
<Stormy> My Wii is pretty much just used as a Gamecube
<Stormy> :P
<Dark_Horst> still not getting the hunting
<Saturn> 08,01that's what we're watching here
<Conyst> IE nuke it from orbit for it is the only way to be sure
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: he's got a crossbow
<Neotyguy40> I think you can get downloadable gamecube games though, so that's nice
<Dark_Horst> he does?
<Dark_Horst> didnt see that
<Lil_B> IE9 is not that bad, a lot of you never gave it a chance anyway so STFU
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: because you're watching lord of the rings...
<Neotyguy40> Can finally purchase the gamecube games I've never had :P
<Dark_Horst> aaaaah
<Dark_Horst> now its clear
<Saturn> 08,01finally.
<Saturn> 08,01:P
*Saturn 08,01loves ballet
<Kimori> seriously?
<Saturn> 08,01so many hot guys in tight tights
<Conyst> I gave IE a chance then I came to my senses and got back on Chrome
<Saturn> 08,01nice... tight... buttockses...
<Neotyguy40> I think so
<Lil_B> I have a Classmate who looks exactly like Frodo... it's unbelievable... He has the Nickname "Gollum" in our Class however
<Kimori> Thats pretty cool if they really are doing that, but I would still prefer the physical game
<cachi01> WAT
<cachi01> wat
<Neotyguy40> Well yea
<Dark_Horst> careful there saturn, we wouldnt want to bust the rating now
<Neotyguy40> If you already have it there's no point in getting another
<Conyst> Calm down Saturn
<soulrider95> I love this new keyboard :)
<Lil_B> ShizuKlaus thanks for mentioning easylist... I found the right Filter rules in their txt File :D
<Saturn> 08,01my mother: "is she a swan?"
<Neotyguy40> But it's not like you can go to your local Gamestop and pick up Kirby Air Ride anymore
<Saturn> 08,01my brother: "no, she's a dancer"
<Stormy> Kirby Air Ride <3
<Stormy> Love that game
<Neotyguy40> City Trial
<Neotyguy40> That's the only part of the game anyone I know plays
<texasboykc09> bbl
<Stormy> Yes
<Stormy> Got hours of play time out of that with my brother
<Neotyguy40> We never play Top Ride though
<Stormy> we got pretty ridiculously competitive
<Neotyguy40> Never enjoyed it
<Stormy> that mode was alright
<Stormy> City Trial is obviously the best though
<cachi01> rarity
<Neotyguy40> o.O
<Stormy> Even just the free run was fun
<Neotyguy40> Smash Bros Melee -> Confirmed for download
<Stormy> You can just drive around and tried to kill each other
<Neotyguy40> Wind Waker -> Confirmed for download
<Neotyguy40> Super Mario Sunshine -> Confirmed for Download
<Neotyguy40> Metroid Prime -> Confirmed for download
<Stormy> Mario Sunshine was another great game
<Stormy> I don't know why everyone hated it :(
<Neotyguy40> What?
<Neotyguy40> I know no one who hates it
<Conyst> So long everyone.
<Stormy> I guess everyone was all like
<Unnr> Saturn: which ballet?
<Stormy> "It's not like real Mario because there's voice acting and no Goombas"
<Stormy> =/
<alexxm|colt> expostion
<thelonecubone> Bye con-damn it :I
<Lil_B> OF MANY COLORS
<Stormy> I always wished they would make a sequel
<soulrider951> god the internet here is so shitty
<Stormy> But I'm not up to date on Nintendo consoles anymore, so I'd never get to play it
<alexxm|colt> so are we only watching fellowship tonight or all of them
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: Swan Lake
<Neotyguy40> Now
<Neotyguy40> I wonder how long it will take for people to make a Wii emulator
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: i've noticed you pinged me. you were talking to Dark_Horst
<Unnr> Ooooh. Which ending Saturn ?
<cachi01> i hope the sad one
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma that must have been further back ... btw, hello :)
<Unnr> cachi01: but even the sad endings vary
<alexxm|colt> so what did you fet Dark92Enigma

<alexxm|colt> stop in the name of love
<DerpyMuffins> How's Christmas for everyone?
<Sundaysmile> pretty good
<Saturn> 08,01x/win 14
<Sundaysmile> full of food and drink
<Unnr> cachi01: there are several variations on that, including one where the suicide breaks the spell, the prince joins her, and several other variations
<soulrider951> DerpyMuffins: pretty good. Got a new keyboard and mouse
<cachi01> i wonder if my pc can handle half life

<thelonecubone> oh yeah, cachi01 have you ask them if it's possible if they could make Sumi's OC?
<cachi01> im pretty sure they can. but i havent asked them how much would it cost
<thelonecubone> ah
<cachi01> for example my oc costs 470 pesos
<cachi01> thats 40 dolalrs
<cachi01> dollars*
<cachi01> wait
<cachi01> i think sumi's would cost the same

<Dark92Enigma> The Enigma's review of LORD OF THE RINGS: FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING: even though i haven't read the books, this movie (and the whole trilogy) follows the book to a T. why? because knowing Peter Jackson as we do it has a stong story, identifiable characters, great character development, and thrilling action to the very end. Thanks for streaming Saturn, and here's to the Hobbit to be as epic as this trilogy 10/10
<Dark92Enigma> sorry
<Dark92Enigma> took so long
<Sundaysmile> movies over :P

<killerpony7733> pony_891577 Take that to a more suited channel. Seriously don't bring it up in mane.
<pony_891577> killerpony7733: Spiderman.mp4
<pony_891577> I've been here for over a year you newfoal.
<pony_891577> I can do what I want.
<thelonecubone> yeah, But the Fucking rules man
<pony_677163> For some reason I can't change my nick
<MLP_Brovakiin> thelonecubone: Geez man, way to drop the F bomb!
<MLP_Brovakiin> :D
<thelonecubone> MLP_Brovakiin: :3
<Yahooz> hey now, fucking the rules is a bit over the top
<killerpony7733> pony_891577 Suit yourself not my IP on the line luckily
<Kencolt> Odd. I don't recognise the name... and there are rules, which you would be aware of had you been here for a year. I find your assertions... wanting.
<pony_891577> Yahooz: I'd fuck your rules ;D
<Jinglebell_icybeauti> Hi, and happy hearth's warming eve everypony!!
<thelonecubone> Hi Jinglebell_icybeauti :)
<Jinglebell_icybeauti> hi thelonecubone
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Jinglebell_icybeauti :)
<Jinglebell_icybeauti> and hi MLP_Brovakiin
<Floris> I'm just gonna leave this here.. http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/12/keep-calm-and-flutter-on-synopsis.html
<pony_240994> JESmith here. Testing using the chat on 3DS
<Jinglebell_icybeauti> pony_240994: No way, I just got one!
<pony_240994> For some reason its not letting me switch my nick
<killerpony7733> Floris Ooooooh you getting banned son.
<Jinglebell_icybeauti> You're not even allowed to know the title in bronystate lol
<cachi01|afk> Jinglebell_icybeauti: as soon as i get mine out of the thingy that i give my things and they give me money for them which i forgot its name. i'll give you my friend code
<GilDash> Why do we have to have idiots on today? Do they really have nothing better to do? (For that matter, why am I on? Hypocritical much? :D)
<Jinglebell_icybeauti> cachi01|afk: Okay, I'l make sure to write it down
<killerpony7733> GilDash Hey you aren't douchy atleast and all.
<MLP_Brovakiin> GilDash: You're not an idiot though :p
<Yahooz> GilDash: that made my day
<GilDash> killerpony7733: I was referring to the "nothing better to do on Christmas" bit. :D
<Jinglebell_icybeauti> My parents also gave me this pony bag with rainbow dash and derpy on it, and inside, there was a mlp hoodie, luna shirt, headphones, and something else I forgot.
<GilDash> I try not to be douchy. Whether I succeed or not is another matter entirely. :D
<Kencolt> I haven't gotten anything... yet. I'm a bit ill, so I had to beg off on the family get-together this year... but my sister in law is coming bylater with what loots I get at this late age.
<Kencolt> Oh, and to pick up the gifts I have for the kids in the clan.
<Stormy> I got a toaster oven, some lotion, a new scarf, an alarm clock, and a wedding guestbook
<Stormy> My brother just downloaded Playstation all stars with the PSN card I gave him
<Stormy> we were just playing that
<Jinglebell_icybeauti> Since I am still young, I got a crapload. U jelly?
<Stormy> and now we're off to another relative's house, be back later :D
<GilDash> Not really. I've got nowhere to put things these days. :D
<Kencolt> Yeah. At my age and pathetic health, all I really want is my old teeth back-- that's not happening any time soon.
<killerpony7733> GilDash also i hope that floris guy gets banned hard. Cause what he linked gave off spoilers to ep 11 which from what i can read though not name at all. Is VERY big for many
<killerpony7733> GilDash Seriously that was douchy as hell if i don't mind such spoilers.
<Yahooz> Floris eh?
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Aye, he broke the rules hard on that one. Problem is he did a hit and run, so you'd have to have join/leave messages on to figure out who he was so you can set an ip ban up. If he's a hit and runner he probably wouldn't use the same username.
<killerpony7733> Yahooz Yeah he linked a EQD page to a upcoming ep explaining what it's plot line will be.
<killerpony7733> GilDash Best cause i can copy paste the line and give the proof away.
<Yahooz> killerpony7733: ill tell the mods. he can be banned right here right now
<killerpony7733> Yahooz Alrighty remember copy the string of messages for proof.
<Yahooz> dontchu worry, i got this
<GilDash> killerpony7733: I can as well. I've got his IP he logged in with and everything.
<killerpony7733> Really though i cannot express how douchy it is to link that page. Really it would ruin a awesome surprise.
<Yahooz> as well as the fact that he broke the rules
<GilDash> It's not as though you're forced to click on the link though. The fact it gives the ep name away is kind of a spoiler warning as well.
<SpeccyRush> one of they great things about seeing join/quits, you see there host so even if they bail they'e still screwed
<GilDash> Also, doesn't !cd give the episode name anyway?
<killerpony7733> Yes but that ep is first out jan 19th? i think
<Vivix> everyone who ops see join quit
<Yahooz> GilDash: not a synopsis. the mods give the new ep name in their newsletter though
<Jinglebell_icybeauti> I read it earlier...Crap, no saying nothing...But it excited me slightly....-prepares for moon launch-
<Yahooz> Vivix: not just ops
<Vivix> no, but everyone who does, do
<Yahooz> anyone with a good client that can
<Vivix> so it's not something to worry about us catching it or not
<Vivix> everyone with any client can
<Yahooz> Vivix: not lightIRC :p
<Vivix> I think you can on webclient too, not sure
<Vivix> Ajax is in lightirc, it does
<Yahooz> Ajax ≠ lightIRC
<GilDash> Yahooz: Oh aye, I know that. I was referring to someone who said earlier that the episode title was never posted on Bronystate. If you can do it with !cd, then it must be.
<Yahooz> in anyway
<Vivix> They're not bundled?
<Dark92Enigma> ok. thank goodness, i havent seen the leaked episodes
<Vivix> yeah !cd reveales name, which is kind of annoying to some of us-
<Yahooz> GilDash: titles dont even count as spoilers as far as im concerned
<Vivix> though ignoring the bot would be easy, I'm too lazy
<SpeccyRush> * Floris (mwnwllddql@131swoi5.cm-6-1c.dynamic.ziggo.nl) has joined #bronystate
<Vivix> they do to some, but very few
<GilDash> Yahooz: Some people do though. I don't like them, but I can deal with it.
<Dark92Enigma> SpeccyRush: how do you know?
<Jinglebell_icybeauti> Bronystate episode policy: There is no episode until saturday.
<SpeccyRush> I'm secretly an op ;P
<Yahooz> SpeccyRush: indeed
<Dark92Enigma> SpeccyRush: :O

<Jinglebell_icybeauti> thelonecubone|Halo3: When you had to stand and sit and stuff, nopony knew what to do, people spoke when it was quiet time, and the church was practically filled. I found it funny when I saw people falling asleep (Even considering it was midnight mass with a choir.)

<cachi01> it was 20 minutes
<cachi01> silly steam
<ekips> what we had christmas specials last week? :/
<thelonecubone> Lel
<Lil_B> I wanted to order the Zelda Historica Book yesterday, but I found out that A Limited Edition Version comes in February... costs 30$ more but I'll take it!
<texasboykc09> i dont know why the new ep. aire today
<thelonecubone> cachi01: How much is for Old Half life anyway>
<thelonecubone> ?*
<cachi01> thelonecubone: gb?
<cachi01> or wat?
<thelonecubone> Cost
<thelonecubone> and gb as well :P
<cachi01> idk i bought the complete pack lol
<alexxm> whats the difference with the limited edition
<ekips> Zelda died for me after Wii :<
<thelonecubone> oh
<cachi01> and i think its 800 mb
<cachi01> but i wont install HL 1 in this pc
<cachi01> just opposing force
<cachi01> ekips: waaaaaaaaaaat
<Lil_B> I tried the new Steam "Big Picture"-mode... it started in 1280x980 (or whatever the 16:9 resolution at 1290 is) and when I wanted to switch to 1920x1080 it told me that my Grafics card isn't good enough... thanks Steam finally someoine told me!
<cachi01> ekips: but....but it was epic D:
<thelonecubone> 800 mb, not bad
<cachi01> thelonecubone: i think its 4.29
<Lil_B> ekips a lot of people didn't liked Skyward Sword, and I, as a huge Zelda Fan, just fail to see why D:
<cachi01> ^
<thelonecubone> oh, well :P
<ekips> I don't know the content of the new Zelda games. But I don't like the gameplay
<Lil_B> Game Grumps don't like it eather, but ... I have yet to hear any real arguments!
<cachi01> thelonecubone: i mean the price
<ekips> Lil_B Maybe I don't like the new Zeldas because I don't like the Wii
<Lil_B> ekips the Gameplay hasn't changed since OoC! You get around, interact with people, get to dungeans and solve them :/
<thelonecubone> cachi01: oh :$
<cachi01> lel
<ekips> Gameplay wasn't the right word. I meant the whole dancing around to move thing
<ekips> I want a proper controller and relax in my chair when I play a game like Zelda
<cachi01> ekips: wait till 2014
<cachi01> we r getting a new zelda
<ekips> I already rage enough when I'm stuck in Zelda. Fiddling with the movements would only add to the rage
<alexxm> whats the new zelda called
<cachi01> we dont know yet
<cachi01> nintendo just said that they were releasing a new zelda in 2014
<ekips> cachi01 with an "oldschool" controller?
<Lil_B> ekips honestly you can just make simple wrist movements to trigger the sword movements or to aim in Skyward Sword
<cachi01> we just have to wait till E3 2013
<Lil_B> btw, anyone here who knows a bit about building PCs?
<cachi01> ekips: well..... wii u gamepad, and i think the only thing you'll need to move is to aim with bow
<ekips> Lil_B what a coincidence, I chose the parts I will order today for my new pc
<cachi01> but i hope they add wii u pro controller compability
<Lil_B> ekips I wanna do that too during the holidays
<cachi01> Lil_B: http://i1002.photobucket.com/albums/af150/The_FalconO6/CurrentLogicalPCBuyingGuide/Guide.png
<ekips> ^
<Lil_B> cachi01 I just wanted to know the Wattage of my Power Supply for the componets I choose :P
<cachi01> oh lol
<ekips> Lil_B bequiet! has a nice calculator for that
<Lil_B> ekips thanks
<ekips> http://www.bequiet.com/de/psucalculator/expert
<thelonecubone> If i built a PC, i'll try to aim for Superb or excellent
<ekips> It's even in german :P
<Lil_B> My PC will be a biest >.< after all I wanna Play Games, and make music, that means I can'tr cheap out on anything except the case...

<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: holy shit
<TwilightSonata> Reikim: Duuuuhhh.
<DashWithRainbows> Sweet, I'm only on the 3rd volume now.
<DashWithRainbows> Near the end of it though.
<thelonecubone> cachi01: Holy sheet
<TwilightSonata> Although if Charizad was a dragon type it would be soooo awesome.
<Reikim> That's what I though.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Charazard can still drop like a fucking rock
<Reikim> Charizard SHOULD be a dragon. But then he'd be OP.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Well then Ice and dragon would murder him
<Reikim> Man why are you hating on Charizard so much.
<twilight_sprinkle> dragons have quite a few weaknesses, but they tend to have better stats
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Because he's fucking overrated
<Yahooz> I gotta say though, Ivysaur is a pimp
<TwilightSonata> It's really annoying though, loads of people think I look like a guy ;A;
<cachi01> thelonecubone: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v246/fi123storm/PA1_Chapter_Fourteen12.jpg
<Reikim> I never said he was THE BEST MON. Only idiots claim there is a BEST MON.
<cachi01> sprunkls u also click it
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: because having an original trio pokemon with 4x weakness to a fairly common type like rock is a pain
<Reikim> I just happen to like him because he's cool.
<TwilightSonata> Plus I kind of have AA cups which freaking sucks ;_;
<Yahooz> TwilightSonata: well ofc you're not a guy
<thelonecubone> cachi01: D:
<Legendary> *facepalm* I found a pic that will make facepalm
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Bidoof is worst pokemon

<twilight_sprinkle> magikarp is epic though
<twilight_sprinkle> a real trooper
<thelonecubone> ^
<thelonecubone> he's right
*cachi01 splashes twilight_sprinkle

<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I know Garchomp is banned
<twilight_sprinkle> ah
<twilight_sprinkle> that sucks
<Reikim> Which is actually kind of nice because otherwise the metagame would stagnate.
<TwilightSonata> Bronysith: It's going awesome ^_^ although I had a haircut so I can't use my own hair for it anymore, so I had to buy a wig :s
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> And Blazakin

<Shizuka> 13railcraft has suspended rails, else no
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Boooo
<Shizuka> 13you might with pistons but that only works until the rail gets a block update
<Shizuka> 13which would be as soon as you place another rail
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well i'll download that later
<Shizuka> 13get FTB Direwolf20 pack
<Shizuka> 13could join my server

<twilight_sprinkle> no
<twilight_sprinkle> im looking at os's people use
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I feel the chance of me getting a gift code is slim to none
<SpeccyRush> Shizuka, what if you had a line of pistons at the spot you wanted to have the tracks float, having rails on each end so it wont do a block update and then activate all the pistons at the same time?
<Shizuka> 13yay version spam
<Shizuka> 13bet mine hasn't changed
<twilight_sprinkle> heh i was wondering if mods could see it
<Shizuka> 13yep, still 0.8.15
<Shizuka> 13sane clients typically alert you that someone sent you a CTCP
<Shizuka> 13[21:35] twilight_sprinkle [jluidtqzns@aeyyns33-29-103-0.buckeyecom.net] requested CTCP VERSION from [Shizuka]:
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah but i didnt know it displayed to everyone, thought its usually only to the person wwhos being versioned
<Shizuka> 13anyway SpeccyRush *maybe* but it's not a great idea
<twilight_sprinkle> if theyre using the proper client that is
<Shizuka> 13no just the person who's versioned :P
<twilight_sprinkle> ok lul
<Shizuka> 13SpeccyRush: if any block on any of the rails changed they'd all get popped off as the connected ones fall
<twilight_sprinkle> i wonder if it shows on my phone....
<JRP> Add nes on Wii u
<JRP> Me
<JRP> Phone stop changing my Dana text
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: does it show /whois too?
<Shizuka> 13no, whois is a request from the server, not clients

<CrystalPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, I never followed the previous gen and I want Minty in the show
<Unnr> Rex_Mundi: That´s because Minty == love
<Unnr> and if you don´t love minty, read http://kimonos-house.livejournal.com and then you will
<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinkle: btw, i wasn't leaving 5 minutes ago, i just quoted Yakko

<KrazyNoobs> I can't draw anyways, sooo...
<Buytoast> They don't care about the quality
<Stallion_of_War> I drew Luna with a Santa hat on yesterday :)
<Buytoast> all that matters to them is publicity
<legendary> its about creativity
<KrazyNoobs> I drew a Fluttershy completely out of Zalgo yesterday (took me 80 minutes)
<Petrified_Discord> Or at least effort
<KrazyNoobs> Zalgo as in the text function

<kidzrul732> I don't know
<Stallion_of_War> He's made a crap ton of money already off it, plus I think there'
<Buytoast> He doesn't care about Minecraft
<Stallion_of_War> there's sort of a fanbase loyalty when you go ahead and say that people can have it if they can't buy it.
<Buytoast> he's milked plenty of cash out of it

<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Celestia is worst alicorn
<Rex_Mundi> Bronysith: You do know this is a show about friendship and 6 different ponies learning how to be better friends with lessons each episode to improve themselvs. right?
<Barbetos> Yeah.. I am done.
<legendary> yesssss
<legendary> wait n
<Sweetie_Belle> 10:30 here
<Buytoast> it's been about 56 episodes
<legendary> no
<Buytoast> you'd think white selfish would've learned to be good by now
<Bronysith> Rex_Mundi: yea, but even then, the show lacks an amazing amount of consistency and character development
<Buytoast> but no
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> She sends 6 very mortal ponies TO MOVE A POSSIBLY VIOLENT DRAGON!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WHICH ARE MOSTLY MAGIC IMMUNE
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> THE FUCK
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: celestia is still sexy though
<cachi01> Pony smexy list. Twilight > Aj > Fluttershy > Rarity > Rainbow dash > pinkie pie
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> cachi01: /)
<Bronysith> cachi01: id like to think rarity is a kind, teasing mistress
<cachi01> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: (\
<Rex_Mundi> Oh God, the ponies are all so sexy, i cant list themm
<legendary> hey guys did you see the leaked episode? big mac and cheerlilee make such a cute couple. *slow brony*
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also Celestia is worst sister
<cachi01> Best pony list. pinkie pie > twilight = rarity > Aj > fluttershy > RD
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: TBH, i think celestia is to busy being molestia to alot of ponies to actually do anything
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: at least thats my head canon T~T
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sister came back after her 1000 banishment... DONT INFORM HER ABOUT THE CHANGES
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> THE SHIT CELESTIA
<legendary> 4=9-d+867
<Rex_Mundi> You guys are so negative
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: stop ranting now
<Sweetie_Belle> GTG bye :(
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: molestia is sexy, drop it
<cachi01> cya Sweetie_Belle :)
<legendary> NO

<NocturnalBlade> bye Sweetie_Belle
<thelonecubone> Bronysith: and Luna is the shy and cute one ^w^
<Rex_Mundi> thelonecubone: What? this place is negative, not compared to 4chan, or Newgrounds... or furaffinity. Especially not furaffinity.
<Kimori> hi Adjeca
<cachi01> and wtf pokehidden u promised christmas release :[
<thelonecubone> cachi01: calm down
<cachi01> >.>
<cachi01> <.<
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: actually, i think that cadance is worst alicorn, cause at least celestia was a previously established character and not shoe horned in for the sake of sales and stupid deus ex machina
<thelonecubone> cachi01: well go play something
<thelonecubone> :P
<Rex_Mundi> Cadence is fairly smoaking herself too.
<Bronysith> i prefer deus ex MACHINE GUN
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> At least Cadance is more useful than celestia
<Bronysith> Rex_Mundi: the wings kill it for me
<cachi01> if you have herpes
<cachi01> jus throw ur wife
<thelonecubone> and you know what? grab some of my stash if you want, blachi
<legendary> when some one leaves its like "bye ""bye"" see ya" when i leave:"......"
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Celestia the one time she helps, GETS TAKEN DOWN LIKE A CHUMP
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: at least Celestia doesnt have a shitty Mary Sue OC story
<Bronysith> like shining armor
<Bronysith> or cadance
<NocturnalBlade> sowwy legendary text flood :$
<legendary> true story
<legendary> yay
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> > Had a brother since they were little, > no mention of him whatsoever till his wedding
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Wat
<legendary> Lets all flood thecomment section YAY
<Rex_Mundi> Bronysith: My theory on alicorns, is that there are 2 special ones (Celestia and luna), and a few much less special ones, like Cadance.
<legendary> no? ok
<Rex_Mundi> Celestia and Luna = alicorn.
<cachi01> the filler ones
<cachi01> lel
<Rex_Mundi> Cadance = winged unicorn
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: "oh, i love my brother so much, that is why i never mention him ever to my closest friends at all"
<legendary> luna+luna=moon
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Bronysith: So is it fair to say I find that retarded?
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: "and hes captain of the royal guard and marrying my other best friend who is a princess and has love magic"
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: yea, cadance and shining armor have no reason to be in the show
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sounds like a bad fanfic Bronysith
<legendary> love magic? *snickers*
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: im sure Shining armor couldve been like a long lost friend or something and the episode could still work
<Rex_Mundi> Bronysith: OK, they should have at least mentioned Cadance and Shining armore bofore they got married. I give you that.
<cachi01> Celestia = Sun and troll Luna = Moon and dreams. Cadence = Love and uhmmm great r34 material?
<Bronysith> nah
<Bronysith> cadances wings just kill it for me
<ouo> what's going on here? :)
<Bronysith> T~T
<cachi01> oh yeah her wings :/
<Unnr> apparently poking with a stick = host time out
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also the whole premise of the wedding plot bugs the shit out of me
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: but hey, what can you do? lauren faust left so the studio has to result to deus ex machina and fanservice to carry out the show
<legendary> luna = Nightmares and dreams get it? nightMAREs hahahaha
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: can i say this
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: stop
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: i take this
<thelonecubone> Unnr: oh yeah, that is what i did after 4 mins
<cachi01> season 2 finale was good
<cachi01> season 3 premiere was meh
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: the whole changeling fight scene was pointless, afterall "only i can break the spell on that door, me, celestia" "go to the elements of harmony and get them" how would they fucking open the door?
<cachi01> not bad not good
<thelonecubone> average
<ouo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZivRFeXsk8M ultimate poking
<Bronysith> cachi01: season 2 finale, only reason people like it is because of the fight scene
<legendary> so i came a cross this website called bronystate and i-...... im still here arent i?
<Rex_Mundi> Bronysith: What do the wings take away exactly. Alicorns are still rare so its not like theres suddenly a proliferation of wings. Cadance is hawt regardless
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Bronysith: Actually I think they were in the room not the actual vault
<cachi01> legendary: no
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The vault had a huge hallway
<cachi01> this is a dream
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: still pisses me off
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: not to mention chrysallis is fucking stupid
<NocturnalBlade> legendary: eeyup
<legendary> ah
<thelonecubone> cachi01: A dream that needs to be paid, you forgotten about that
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Need love, instill fear on every one
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: "your love made me more powerful than celestia" 5 seconds later "trying to gain power with love? yea that wont work" T~T
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> If she gains power by love how did love beat her?
<thelonecubone> you need to pay 62$ a month to be in dreambronystate
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I dun get it
<Barbetos> Need to sleep.. but want to watch Doctor Who Season 2 Finale
<Barbetos> Such a delima
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: thats like, one country nuking another country, then that country gets the same nuke and the original country is all "that nuke wont work"
<Bronysith> ///////)_=
<cachi01> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: love + magic
<legendary> I once played this game called real life.. it had a horrible storyline
<Unnr> http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2253230/Footballs-marked-warning-stating-choking-hazard-according-EU-regulations.html
<Unnr> hehehehehehehe
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> cachi01: Still retarded
<cachi01> yeah u r right......
<legendary> it hd good graphics
<legendary> *had
<ouo> still fireplace
<thelonecubone> Unnr: Lol
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: worst fucking villain of hte series, even then her motives werent really all that villainy, just common conqueror like alexander the great, for her kingdom to survive another has to fall
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also couldent Chrysalis just do things peacfully? Why did she have to do a take over?
<cachi01> caause
<cachi01> she is hawt
<thelonecubone> cause plt
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Stupid?
<thelonecubone> plot*
<legendary> the tutorial lasted 18 years
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: would you let a demon basically steal your soul?
<legendary> the controlls were confusing
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Well Im sure they could arange something
<Rex_Mundi> Heres a question, can unicorns become powerfull enough to challenge Celestia? Maybe Sombra could have had a chance if it wasnt 2 on 1. Maybe
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: again, the entire season 2 finale was just pure fanserivice
<sub06905|GBA> http://derpy.me/xSoDj
<sub06905|GBA> :3
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Rex_Mundi: Well since shit like a god damn brooch lying around yea
<Barbetos> party hard
<Bronysith> cause "DURR, LAUREN ISNT HERE ANYMORE AND WE HAVE NO GOOD WRITERS, SO WE HAVE TO RELY ON FANSERVICE AND FIGHT SCENES" goddamnit
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> How the fuck did you miss that celestoa
<legendary> fanservice everywhere
<legendary> party soft
<Bronysith> seriously, fuck the season 2 finale
<cachi01> http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lq04v7b5bJ1qjf12k.jpg
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I love how Equestria has ARTIFACTS OF POWER JUST LYING AROUND
<Rex_Mundi> The season 2 finalle are the best 2 episodes yet
<cachi01> ikr
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Good job celestia
<legendary> woah watchut we got a badass over here
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Good job making sure your kingdom is safe
<Bronysith> it wasnt consistent, the characters contradicted themselves and also completely neglected what they learned in the episode 3 of season 2, right SpadeKyurem[WoW] ?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Yea
<Barbetos> who fucking cares.
<Barbetos> I am glad they at least acknowledge previous episodes
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: "always believe your friends, even if you think its not a big deal" /)_=
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also Discord was kinda stupid in his plannings
<Barbetos> Most cartoons don't
<Barbetos> And that is one of the things that got me hooked on MLP
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: not as dumb as chrysallis
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> If he didnt treat things like a game he would have won
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: hes not as dumb as chryssalis
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> His own personality was his downfall
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: at least he wasnt stupid like chrysallis
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: and at least he wasnt deus ex bossima
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also how come only shining armor can maintain the shield
<Rex_Mundi> Discord will be discord, he does eviil for the luls. Some ponies arent interested in logical things like money. Some ponies just want to watch the world burn.
<legendary> I dont how 1 crystal pony said" the crystall princess is back" but it showed cadense as a filly in the season 2 finale
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> doesnt canterlot have..I dont know ALOT OF UNICORNS
<Unnr> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Plot holes, let me show them you!
<cachi01> you know
<cachi01> u can still be a filyl
<cachi01> filly
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: it was written like a bad fanfic, "only a shield that only i am strong enough to maintain"
<cachi01> and a princess
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: CONVENIENCE
<Bronysith> FOR THE ENEMY
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: also, who the fuck sent a threat to canterlot?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Bronysith: I really find the finale to be bad in logic
<legendary> me
<Barbetos> How is that such a stretch?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also bride acts like a total bitch...BLOW IT OFF
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Wat
<Rex_Mundi> The episode does explain why Cadance is a Princess. it seems she is decended from Crystal royalty and or related to Celestia.
<legendary> Derpy hooves vs a muffin man. GO
<cachi01> this
<cachi01> isnt
<cachi01> 4chan
<twilight_sprinkle> "ermagerd no lelouche? dis season is gunna suk"
<Barbetos> They become friends. Move on.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sparta
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: also, cadance magic=blue, chrysallis magic = green....no one fucking notices this
<Rex_Mundi> 3 female alicorns. 0 male alicorns. Shinanigans!
<twilight_sprinkle> fakken lelouche fangirls
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Bronysith: Or her fucking singing
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: is lelouch that good of a character anyways?
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: "hey is this bitch singing how shes planning on destroying us all right in front of us?"
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: "lets stand here like idiots and find out"
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also cant you dectect magic or something?
<cachi01> Rex_Mundi: its because malealicorns look like this https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A9Y9JNZCYAAWZP-.jpg:large
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: depends in terms of quality? yeah very good imo. in terms of personality? hard to say
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You would think celestia would do a sweep to check for spys or such
<legendary> best pony that sings? obliously Luna
<thelonecubone> cachi01: lelelelel sprunkls oc
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: just goes to show, the studio CANT write good villain songs, and the setup is fucking wrong, it wasnt like that in the little mermaid,
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: but i'm liking the new characters so far, and lelouche wasnt even my favorite character in the prev seasobs
<Bronysith> jesus fucking christ
<Rex_Mundi> Bronysith: Are you trying to put logic into the song and dance numbers? Its like baliwood in ponyville with the random song and dance numbers.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I still want to know what the hell Luna was doing during the whole thing Bronysith
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: lunaughty
<Bronysith> :P
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The whole did I miss anything line seems so trollish
<legendary> Luna sleeps during the day and Celestia vice versa
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Oh you didnt miss anything...just the invasion of canterlot
<cachi01> anyway.
<cachi01> g2g
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: i heard some questions the fandom has will be expanded on in s3
<thelonecubone> Bye cachi01 :)
<cachi01> goodnight everypony :)
<Barbetos> Has anyone actually seen Luna or Celestia sleeping?
<cachi01> merry xmas
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: perhaps that will be one of them
<thelonecubone> sleep well :)
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: dude, the current writers have no idea how to write, so they just give SHITLOADS OF FANSERVICE TO MAKE UP FOR IT
<twilight_sprinkle> bye cachi01
<legendary> oh you miss the kiss
<Bronysith> Barbetos: in my bed
<Barbetos> But is that sleep?
<Bronysith> : D
<legendary> Bye Legendary
<Rex_Mundi> Goodnight cachi01, may Luna grant you 'interesting' dreams!
<Bronysith> Barbetos: after they are done with me they sleep yes
<Barbetos> Are you SURE?
<DaringDerpy> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3sc1nc/
<Barbetos> I doubt any of it even happened
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also why the hell does Canterlot have a fucking cave they used to put ponies in?
<Barbetos> Celestia just magics you, and nothing actually happened.
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: sex dungeon :P
<Bronysith> Barbetos: doesnt matter had awesome sex
<NocturnalBlade> nite cachi01
<Rex_Mundi> Obviously, the ponyverese is darker than the show would have you belive.
<legendary> it was justa mine everypony fogot about
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: again, its the current writers trying and failing at being epic...the show doesnt need to be epic
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I swear the s2 finale could be passed off as a bad fanfic
<Bronysith> like
<Bronysith> at
<Bronysith> ALL
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: it is a bad fanfic =_=
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: animation was good though >.>
<Rex_Mundi> We nead Tirak to kidnap some ponies and take them to midnight castle. and pony slavery, more of that.
<legendary> If you overthink it its bad but i found ejoyeable
<Bronysith> the show seems to be more focused on animation now though instead of good writing or character development
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-XPNAexw4Q
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sombra was boring
<twilight_sprinkle> it was enjoyable that is true, but it did feel like it was going off in the wrong direction
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> He had nothing interesting going for him
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: more villainous than chrysallis
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> All it wa, GRAGH and crystals
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Get a dictionary damn it
<legendary> Gak had more dialogue than King sombra
<Bronysith> at least we knew who the villain was the whole time instead of "OH HEY THIS IS BAD GUY HERE HEY HEY THIS IS BAD GUY THIS IS WHO YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO FIGHT"
<Bronysith> friggin deus ex bossima
<thelonecubone> Mr. Sombrero is a better villian than chrysallis
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Bronysith: Chrysalis seemed shoehorned
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-XPNAexw4Q
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: i fucking said that, she was put in for clop

*Bronysith blasts off before shit storm
<Unnr> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: 3 is pretty good, up to the end
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I dont like games that give me moral choices that dont fucking matter
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Why give them to me in the first place
<legendary> i never really liked mass effect or any RPG except walking dead and fallout
<Unnr> Fallout 3 makes me sad
<Unnr> its not the story of the vault dweller
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I like fallout new vegas
<legendary> i bet nobody here ever heard of command and conquer 3:kanes wrath
<Barbetos> yes
<legendary> wat
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka how do i add the logisticspipes ? already disabled the portalgun
<Barbetos> And that is red alert 2
<Unnr> legendary, but that was the one where he had the cool head makeup
<Barbetos> Well.. Actually you are right
<Shizuka> 13sec i'll get link
<Barbetos> Forgot about kanes wrath
<Unnr> Anypony here play Myth: The Fallen Lords
<Unnr> ?
<Shizuka> 13http://ci.thezorro266.com/job/LogisticsPipes/37/
<Unnr> Such an amazing game
<Barbetos> I think it was not good.
<Rex_Mundi> Fallout 3 is stupid. New Vegas is the greatest RPG of the decade
<Shizuka> 13drop that into the mods folder, might have to start the game once to fill out the folder
<legendary> i liked kanes wrath that 1 was my favorite
<Shizuka> 13launcher will put all the files in Direwolf20/ next to the launcher

<Kipkat07_Scarf> you have lost the game thelonecubone
<thelonecubone> ohai anon
<J_E_Smith71> That jumble of words
<DRHUnleashed> complex language
<KillaMeth420> yo
<Afflict> hey
<twilight_sprinkle> that reminds me, i need to get off my lazy butt and finally try to fix my ancient psp
<J_E_Smith71> Err letters
<thelonecubone> translation: i'm not sure what am i typing
<Afflict> I agree
<Afflict> nevermind
<Kipkat07_Scarf> twilight_sprinkle: I am immensely grateful but I point out flaws too often I suppose..
<Kencolt> I got a new shirt, a bit of cash (odd for a 55 year old, but an extra 20 mis never turned down) some pony (Which I did NOT expect, but four buttons and a couple of hang-ups-- and one of the hyang-ups was DERPY) is nice, and a reproduction of one of my Grandmotehr's painting, to be framed and hung.\
<KillaMeth420> what i miss?
<thelonecubone> twilight_sprinkle: you got an old PSP :O
<twilight_sprinkle> my psp works, but it got hit on the back a while ago and the screen doesnt turn on, wonder what it cold be
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonecubone: i had it for years
<Afflict> nothing
<thelonecubone> my brother has his, he doesnt use it all the time, he got it when we move back to the aparments
<twilight_sprinkle> im wondering if i should buy pokemon b/w and b/w 2
<twilight_sprinkle> they make them too fast
<thelonecubone> twilight_sprinkle: for the new gen yes
*Kipkat07_Scarf is still trying to get used to the smaller keyboard on his laptop
<thelonecubone> Kipkat07_Scarf: you'll get use to it
<thelonecubone> my keyboard is so old and small xD
<thelonecubone> and the laptop is like 8 years old
<Kencolt> Desktop only for me. I have neither a need for a laptop nor a desire for one.
<thelonecubone> still runs good
<texasboykc09> thelonecubone, how good?
<thelonecubone> Kencolt: aye, everyone has their favourites
<thelonecubone> texasboykc09: not sure how to say it
<Kipkat07_Scarf> DAMN IT ALL!! I have to do my lab report :'(
<Polydunami> Finally joined the iPhone crowd
<Polydunami> :S
<texasboykc09> thelonecubone, play games on it?
<thelonecubone> Kipkat07_Scarf: how long till you go back to school?
<Kencolt> I'm looking at the not-quite-a-stream and thinking, "I have a fireplace, I have the logs left by the previous owner, I could make an actual fire-- but I'd have to clean it up. That would suck."
<thelonecubone> unable too
<Kipkat07_Scarf> wait... I can wait till morning to start it
<thelonecubone> the new ones i mean
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: iphone 5?
<Afflict> Did Playstation Allstars get released?
<Polydunami> I believe it's 4
<twilight_sprinkle> ok, i dont like the 5th one much anyway
<Kipkat07_Scarf> thelonecubone: I get back on 4 January
<twilight_sprinkle> its too long, hard to scroll with a thumb of one arm
<thelonecubone> Polydunami: is it bigger then your palm of your hand?
<Polydunami> Well, it was a good Christmas, then
<Polydunami> Not that I can tell
<thelonecubone> Kipkat07_Scarf: work on it tomorrow then
<Polydunami> It's longer, but not wider
<thelonecubone> Polydunami: well Iphone4
<thelonecubone> :P
<Kipkat07_Scarf> thelonecubone: I had an excuse not to start it till now but I need to finish it
<Polydunami> Yep. So then, first app I download is that My Little Pony game.
<thelonecubone> Kipkat07_Scarf: you got enough time to finish it, but i recomend you to start it tomorrow
<twilight_sprinkle> i accidentally made it so that i wont get a single daily reward for playing the game til 2021
<thelonecubone> so you dont have to worry about it till later
<Polydunami> Oh dear
<Kipkat07_Scarf> true.
<thelonecubone> twilight_sprinkle: oh god
<Polydunami> How do you fudge that?
<J_E_Smith71> twilight_sprinkle: The heck did that happen?
<twilight_sprinkle> i was told that if you do the manual day switch bug then you wont get a reward for that day even if you set the actual date back,so i thought that when doing the manual day switch bug if i set it to 2020 i would still get the rwards until that year
<twilight_sprinkle> but it turns out it includes all days until that date
<KillaMeth420> I think it did
<twilight_sprinkle> i thought i would set it to 2020 and then set it back to 2012 so i could get my rewards for 8 years, but alas
<Polydunami> Is there any way to uninstall an app from your iPhone?
<Kimori> hi
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: nope youre stuck with them forever :P
<KillaMeth420> yo
<Polydunami> Nothing to reset the whole game?
<Polydunami> Dang
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: im joking :P
<Kimori> how was your christmas?
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: to delete an app you press any app, and hold for a bit
<thelonecubone> Polydunami: I think you're supposed to hold the button on the phone for a bit till you see a X on the app
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: then it starts jiggling
<thelonecubone> or what sprunkls just said :P
<Polydunami> Okay, I've never needed to do that before
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: all the apps start jiggling i mean, and X's appear, so you can delete them then
<twilight_sprinkle> and move them around
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: you can take screenshots btw by pressing the top button and the front button simultaneously
*ouo gives DRHUnleashed a christmas sock c:
<Polydunami> Oh, I see

<thelonecubone> Hi SuperChristmas64 :)
<texasboykc09> twilight_sprinkle, aww
<Shizuka> 13TheGreatAndPowerfulT: sorry bout that .-.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> don't worry
<Shizuka> 13not sure what caused dynmap to start spamming..
<SuperChristmas64> 11,02hai :D
<SuperChristmas64> 11,02Shizuka is pink o3o
<thelonecubone> http://i.imgur.com/jaIgG.jpg
<KrazyNoobs> I'm back
<thelonecubone> wb KrazyNoobs :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> shizu, you know how can i add my old map to this launcher ?
<Shizuka> 13move the save folder to Direwolf20/minecraft/saves
<SuperChristmas64> 11,02imma krazy noob \o3o/
<Shizuka> 13but if the mods don't match it might bork
<thelonecubone> SuperChristmas64: a krazy noob that is sillieh :3
*KrazyNoobs is more of a noob.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka nah my old map didn't have any mods aside from singleplayer commands and reis map
<thelonecubone> Super sillieh ^w^
<Shizuka> 13unless you mean nonmod world, but extrabiomes will kick in on new chunks
*KrazyNoobs but is krazy, too.
<texasboykc09> hello KrazyNoobs
<SuperChristmas64> 11,02thelonecubone: moo :3
<thelonecubone> Moo :3
<KrazyNoobs> Every time an admin says the word, "kick" or "ban", I get scared.
<Shizuka> 13what about
<Shizuka> 13KICKBAN
<KrazyNoobs> That's how krazy of a noob i am
<twilight_sprinkle> k-line sounds scariest to me
<KrazyNoobs> Kickban isn't as intimidating, to tell the truth.
<KrazyNoobs> idk why
<texasboykc09> KrazyNoobs, why does it scare you
<thelonecubone> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eJay2QHmZM
<Unnr> Shizuka: dun dun dunnnnn
<KrazyNoobs> tecasboykc09: It really doesn't, I was using that as an example for a noob.
<KrazyNoobs> It is only when they say kick or ban in the same sentence as your name you really get worried. inb4 someadminpony does it
<Shizuka> 13yay nether breaks dynmap .-.
<texasboykc09> KrazyNoobs, no i see why, i would too
<SuperChristmas64> 11,02kick and ban someone? alright
<twilight_sprinkle> k-line sounds scariest to me because it doesnt have the classical words of kick or ban in it, it sounds like something else and something especially badm which it is

<KrazyNoobs> I remember when I got banned permanately for my brother getting on my keyboard, I thought, at the time, that I was never going to get back in to the best Brony Livestream on the internet (chat area, that is what makes me spend hours here)
<ouo> damn that brothers
<Unnr> secret asian langauge?
<KrazyNoobs> He went on and started talking about disgusting stuff with Pokemon.
<ouo> they always post porns and r34
<ouo> and arguing
<thelonecubone> ouo: porn and r34 are the same
<KrazyNoobs> Rule 34 isn't porn, it is just genetilia drawn on to characters.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0oV3jid-0c&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577&index=124
<KrazyNoobs> Which is wierd.
<thelonecubone> KrazyNoobs: eh, true
<thelonecubone> but let's not go that far
<KrazyNoobs> But yeah, I got banned twice because of him, and I thought they would never let me on again.
<ouo> ig i'll do something like that this isn't me, it's my brother >_>
<KrazyNoobs> But I changed the password to my computer, and he is now off.
<KrazyNoobs> He is 13, by the way, and drew penises all over my old brony shirts. At least my parents made him buy me new ones (in a larger size, so they actually fit this time), and he also had to pay for the shipping.
<KrazyNoobs> This was about 3 weeks, 4 weeks ago
<Sc00tal00> Aw well, people do insensitive things. : /
<ouo> oh i forgot on english cancer != crayfish
<ouo> ._.
<texasboykc09> KrazyNoobs, how did you get back on
<thelonecubone> KrazyNoobs: your parents should've disipline a little bit more, because quite frankly that was rude
<texasboykc09> seeing that you dont have the best of luck
<twilight_sprinkle> ouo: so its your brother who posts the questionable pic here occasionally?
<Shizuka> 13HOW ARE YOU GENTLEMEN //

<thelonecubone> Saturn: same here
<Canadian_Brony> I /hate/ going anywhere without atleast socks
<KrazyNoobs> texasboykc09: Yeah, although sometimes, I type something questionable, and I ask myself whether it is worth posting. I only do this very few times, sometimes everypony is okay with it, once, I was really irresponsible and went on google to find something (a symbol), and I was stupid enough to post it. I was severly warned, and I will not do that again.
<Canadian_Brony> mind you, I live in a basement where all the floors are hard and cold
<ouo> i always wear socks

*AdamTheDuck steals SuperChristmas64's beer
<KrazyNoobs> I always rethink pressing Enter after I have typed the comment when there is a discussion of r34 or something like that, as I don't want to post anything too offensive (even mentioning that think I said back there is making me think this is questionable)
<texasboykc09> KrazyNoobs, i was there for that and baconmane was very serious
*AdamTheDuck guzzles the beer before SuperChristmas64 has a chance to react
<thelonecubone> AdamTheDuck: i wanted it ;3;
<Canadian_Brony> the only time I will go barefoot is in our 2-week session of not-snowing that we dare to call Summer
<SuperChristmas64> 11,02D:
<Unnr> Saturn: you should buy a bucket of live ladybirds off of amazon
<thelonecubone> you're a fast drinker, AdamTheDuck ;3;
<KrazyNoobs> texasboykc09: When I got in trouble with baconmane was when i was talking about how I used to be in teh GNAA, and everyone was making a huge deal out of it. At the time, I was urgently trying to change the conversation.
*AdamTheDuck gives SuperChristmas64 the empty beer bottle o.o

<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-fRuoMIfpw MY BRAND!
<Lunar_Brony> Unnr hehe, I saw a girl (try to) play a Hurdy Gurdy a few months ago. She was dressed up as a hurdy girl in a (once) old goldpan town.
<Lunar_Brony> she was awful, but I got to dance with her after :)
<Lunar_Brony> you will never dance the same way again after you dance with a hurdy
<Ponies47> Rawr. Back got bored
<Lunar_Brony> hey Ponies47
<Unnr> Lunar_Brony:There are few instruments worse sounding than a poorly played gurdy
<thelonecubone> lel
<thelonecubone> wb Ponies47
<Lunar_Brony> Unnr ugh, tell me about it -__-
<Lunar_Brony> hey Ponies47, have you ever danced "Stag" before? *innocent smile*
<Unnr> Lunar_Brony: the term, like a cat being swung by its tail comes to hoof....
<Ponies47> Eh?
<Unnr> >_<
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 I'm guessing you don't even know what that is...
<Ponies47> Nope
<Lunar_Brony> Tell you what. Put a white hankerchief around you wrist and you'll find out soon enough :)
<Ponies47> O.O
<Lunar_Brony> inb4 he just Googles it
<Unnr> worse is if you are in the same room as a poorly played gurdy and a poorly played Rauschpfeife or Shawm
<AdamTheDuck> Stag - To go alone "I'm goin stag to the dance."
<AdamTheDuck> o.O
<Lunar_Brony> AdamTheDuck not when you dance stag
<twilight_sprinkle> anyway im out, bye
<AdamTheDuck> Just a search on the Urban Dictionary .-.
<Lunar_Brony> it's when two guys practice dancing: one plays the male, the other the female
<AdamTheDuck> Bye twilight_sprinkle
<Lunar_Brony> g'night twilight_sprinkle
*aniderp|bestfruitcak hugs her derpy plush
<Ponies47> Night twilight_sprinkle
<Lunar_Brony> the one who play's female wears a white hankerchief around his wrist to designate him as the female
<thelonecubone> Bye twilight_sprinkle :)
<Lunar_Brony> unfortunately, the first, last, and (so far) only time I've danced stag, I was the poor soul who played the female
<Lunar_Brony> and let me tell you, girls must have nimble feet if they can do the moves I was told to "attempt"
<thelonecubone> well, gonna go to sleep, night everyone :)

<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back KrazyNoobs
<JRP2234> ie is good.........for getting other browsers

<d3rb> silver
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ok silver one it is
<Cypresswolf> bows and arrows....I'd like to play skyrim all day...dont think I can get away with it - on the other hand, I know the jobsite is a mud pit, got heavy rain early yesterday morning with the cold front....
<Cypresswolf> and I dont fancy working in the cold today...
<Cypresswolf> If anyone asks....I overslept >_>
<AdamTheDuck> Cypresswolf, you sure did >_> <_<
<Cypresswolf> ...too much...eggnog? Yeah, Eggnog! Thats it >_>
<d3rb> i slerpt too much during the day now im wide awake at 11:44 pm
<d3rb> so much for work tomorrow
<d3rb> so, who has plans for new years?
<Cypresswolf> I doubt we have much to do - the last 2 weeks, we got done with the latest plan updates in less than an hour - we're waiting on other crews to finish their stuff, before we can move forward - its all little odds and ends with the underground
<Cypresswolf> spent the rest of the day doing nothing, pretending to "organize" our conex box
<Cypresswolf> just to look busy...can only go so far
<d3rb> had to google conex box
<d3rb> bassically a shipping container right?
<d3rb> at least they look like them
<Cypresswolf> yes
<Cypresswolf> plenty of storage space in those things - you have to have those on the jobsite nowadays - didnt use them 20 years ago - mainly to store things you dont want stolen
<d3rb> fair enough, equipment isnt cheap
<Cypresswolf> pvc and emt pipe we still keep outside - no one's gonna take that stuff, copper wire, cords, ladders, etc - inside as well as little stuff - couplings, screws, breakers - stuff that have to stay dry
<Cypresswolf> breakers I mean
<Cypresswolf> ...by the sound of it, seems my brother isnt getting up for work either (keeps hitting his snooze button) :D
<d3rb> lol, work is for chumps, he's got the right idea
<KrazyNoobs> SO
<KrazyNoobs> MUCH
<KrazyNoobs> SILENCE
<d3rb> i know right
<aniderp|bestcakeever> Andrew: i took the pic

<Kandarihu> Well, it's time to head into and through the maelstrom. The more we wait, the worse it's gonna get. So I'll see you later guys. I might check in from restaurants along the way.
<GilDash> Kandarihu: Alright. Good luck and godspeed. :)
<GilDash> texasboykc09: Holla! :)
<d3rb> hey texasboykc09
<Andrew> 08,01just bought this with my parents' christmas money: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Calvin-Hobbes-Bill-Watterson/dp/1449433251/ref=tag_dpp_lp_edpp_ttl_in
<Andrew> 08,01rather, my christmas money from my parents
<MLP_Brovakiin> ohai texasboykc09 :)
<GilDash> The yellow one has a name! :D
<Gold_Demona> Ooh, Calvin and Hobbes! Nice! =D
<GilDash> Okay, so first the undead, now the forces of Hell are joining us. XD
<texasboykc09> hope all had a nice christmas, people lost everything on christmasday 2012 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rXgL3B1L1Q
<GilDash> Sorry, the tornadoes got confused. They should have arrived on 21st.
<Buytoast> That day was already BLOWN enough out of proportion.
<Gold_Demona> Worst apocalypse ever. Not impressed. >:C
<d3rb> worst...or best?
<GilDash> It was pretty damned pathetic, wasn't it?
<Gold_Demona> Eeyup
<Gold_Demona> It was a failpocalypse
<GilDash> I was expecting raining fire. Bitterly disappointed.
<Gold_Demona> I was at LEAST expecting zombies
<Gold_Demona> Had my peashooters out and everything.
<GilDash> Eh, zombies are overdone. I wouldn't mind seeing something more traditional. Plagues, locusts, toads, that kind of thing.
<Gold_Demona> Ah yes, the plagues
<Gold_Demona> I don't suppose the common cold counts as a plague. =/
<GilDash> Gold_Demona: Dunno, but mine's beating me something rotten right now.
<GilDash> I usually don't have difficulties breathing with colds... -_-
<Gold_Demona> Yeah it tends to do that, but then your immune system will wake up and kick its ass.
<GilDash> Gold_Demona: It's actually your immune system causing your symptoms.
<d3rb> just eat those vitamin c tablets like they're candy
<Gold_Demona> It'll walk up to the cold virus and be like "Hey, you punks! Get outta dis bice body!" and make the virus so scared it make them want to go home and go to bed.
<Gold_Demona> dis nice*
<GilDash> I could try sing to thrash metal to get it to leave. Might end up sounding like doom metal though. XD
<Gold_Demona> lol
<GilDash> I wonder if a VA has ever used a cold for a temporary character?
<VenHur> Hi guys, the other day, I got Assassin's Creed.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya VenHur :)
<d3rb> hey VenHur
<texasboykc09> hello VenHur
<GilDash> VenHur: Holla! :)
<GilDash> VenHur: I presume you mean AC3 and not the first one. :D
<VenHur> GilDash: NOPE.avi
<GilDash> VenHur: Oh, you do actually mean the first one?
<VenHur> GilDash: It IS the first one, I only brought just to prevent story spoilers from the later installment.
<GilDash> VenHur: Fair enough. I've not played any of the others except for the first one.

<CCharmanderK> Mind you, I normally love Christmas, but this year was just painfully stressful for me.
<CCharmanderK> Mostly because of my sister, which I will NOT get into.
<Bronysith> CCharmanderK: i like sword
<CCharmanderK> Bronysith: Wat?
<Bronysith> i like swords
<MirrorImage> dare i say the obvious here? "Spend 15 minutes creating your face - never see it for the rest of the game"
<CCharmanderK> O...okay... o_o?
<killerpony7733> MirrorImage What if he uses third person?
<MirrorImage> killerpony7733 - ok, so you see his mullet
<alexxm> take all the things
<MLP_Brovakiin> Loot everything so you can sell it later :3

<MirrorImage> ouo - VATS + Fat Boys makes all combat interesting
<Bronysith> vats?

<MirrorImage> hey, it's not like I could hit that gecko square in the face that charged me from nowhere
<MirrorImage> so if i reflex-activate VATS, i'm going to murder it in the face
<ouo> I think it would be better if you can turn pause but not only to chose there to shot
<ouo> i think it should be like in KOTOR
<MirrorImage> well, bringing up the Pipboy pauses you as well
<MirrorImage> for things like using items and changing weapons
<MirrorImage> (and putting on a suit of Power Armor in the middle of combat)
<ouo> why she is following you?

<ouo> aaah graveyard food
<MirrorImage> yes, nothing like the zest that a little necrosis adds
<ouo> suddenly wild scorpio appears
<GilDash> Call me weird, but I'm not really a fan of necrosis in my food. A little to zesty for my tastes.
<MirrorImage> well, that's a Bethesda game for you...

<DerpyMuffins> Vegas is an unofficial 4
<Vivix> Can't remember who said it, but it was someone here who said four is in dev/prep
<DerpyMuffins> Did Wrek crash again?
<Vivix> Well, kindof, but the count is 1 2 bos and that horrible ps game, 3 nv and now four in a few years
<DerpyMuffins> Creepy

<Bronysith> DerpyMuffins: aniderp_work is a girl
<Jmo> No shit Bronysith, he's asking if her ex-boyfriend is a guy, but the answer is obvious.
<Jmo> Get your shit together.
<aniderp_work> yea my ex bf is a boy
<DerpyMuffins> What kind of guy gives a blanket for Christmas?
<Jmo> You don't require Sherlock Holmes to figure this out.
<aniderp_work> jaymoo :>
<aniderp_work> i showed my hoodie right?
<aniderp_work> i forgot if i did...
<Mattcrowley2a> Hey all.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai Mattcrowley2a :)
<aniderp_work> well i gotta work now
<aniderp_work> bai
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye aniderp_work :)
<Bronysith> there needs to be more final fantasy fighting games
<Mattcrowley2a> Indeed.
<J_E_Smith71> DerpyMuffins: Linus from Peanuts:p
<Bronysith> teh peanuts is so depressing
<Mattcrowley2a> So how's everyone on the day after Christmas?
<DerpyMuffins> I'm using my Christmas gift right now
<Bronysith> same
<Bronysith> a playstation vita <3
<Mattcrowley2a> I am not jealous.
<MLP_Brovakiin> I need to get rid of my vita... I barely used it :I
<J_E_Smith71> Can't really use any of my Christmas gifts till I get home. Got3 games but can't play em yet
<ouo> meh i think i lost it
<ouo> sorry
<J_E_Smith71> Err Wii and PS3 games
<CrystalPhoenix> what game>
<CrystalPhoenix> ?**
<Mattcrowley2a> I feel like we all don't always get what we do desire most of the time.
<J_E_Smith71> CrystalPhoenix: Epic Mickey 2 and Ratchet and Clank: Full Frontal Assualt
<CrystalPhoenix> interesting
<Vivix> Getting anything at all is nice enough
<CrystalPhoenix> Mattcrowley2a, be happy with what they give you, consider yourself lucky you're in such a comfortable life
<Vivix> I got tickets to festival, very content~
<Bronysith> Vivix: yay~
<Bronysith> can i tag along?
<Vivix> Welp, you'd have to supply your own ticket, and endure hours of indierock
<J_E_Smith71> VioletGreySha: Exactly. My parents can't afford many gifts anymore so I can only ask for a few. Thankfully those two games were pretty much all I wanted. Don't want a WiiU just yet
<J_E_Smith71> Tab fail
<Vivix> Did you mean me? If so, yeah, We never had much money growing up, but getting anything is really nice
<Vivix> and giving is reaaally nice-
<J_E_Smith71> That response was to Vivix
<Vivix> :3

<AssertiveFluttershy1> yeah
<Wrek> 05keep the discussion of that shitpile out of here
<AssertiveFluttershy1> like ga-
<cachi01> legendary_brony: how can you fail at that game?
<ApplejackSwag> I just found out about how the stream got hacked during the one bad apple episode
<AssertiveFluttershy1> sup cachio
<legendary_brony> the race
<cachi01> hijacked
<cachi01> sup AssertiveFluttershy1 :)
<AssertiveFluttershy1> :)
*ouo got every hidden scene
<Wrek> 05ApplejackSwag: why do you say it was hacked? it wasnt hacked
<legendary_brony> and i need to be unicorn for trixie
<AssertiveFluttershy1> seems like the conversations starting to pick up
<legendary_brony> nah
<legendary_brony> ok jeesh
<Wrek> 05as stated on the post we made on the frontpage
<AssertiveFluttershy1> realy wish I could join in the artist training grounds this time around but I lack a scaner
<Wrek> 05it was a hijack caused by the stream provider at the time having the key visible for all to use
<ApplejackSwag> chack this out then http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ9vWulShds
<Wrek> 05lolstream or whatever their name was did it to get traffic
<Lil_B> hello everyone :)
<Lightning_Wing> hello everypony
<AssertiveFluttershy1> hey lilb!
<ApplejackSwag> hey Lil_B
*Bronysith spots a Lil_B
<Wrek> 05ApplejackSwag: its still nto a hack dimwit

<legendary_brony> */tp legendary_brony Bronystate*
<Lightning_Wing> O.o
<Lil_B> thanks AssertiveFluttershy1 ApplejackSwag and Bronysith :)
<ApplejackSwag> no
<Bronysith> cachi01: i think this bastard is ban evading
<AssertiveFluttershy1> :)
<AssertiveFluttershy1>
<ApplejackSwag> i'm not 1
<cachi01> Bronysith: i also think so
<cachi01> oh hi Lil_B :)
<Lil_B> aloa cachi01 :)
<Bronysith> cachi01: dissidia needs a port to the ps3
<cachi01> indeed it does
<ApplejackSwag> love the song that I have on
<Bronysith> T~T
<ApplejackSwag> this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-npBowNYDfg who first posted that?
<ApplejackSwag> on the stream
<AssertiveFluttershy1> Hay bacon strips?
<CrystalPhoenix> ouo posted that here before today
<CrystalPhoenix> a few minutes ago
<ApplejackSwag> yeah
<Lil_B> I think I finally should do what I have to do... If you take to long to finish a song, delete it, because your artistic flow will nopt come back... must delete all my Projects now :/
<ApplejackSwag> i love it
<GilDash> Lil_B: That's not a very good idea...
<CrystalPhoenix> I linked the song before
<AssertiveFluttershy1> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Vivix> I delete songs all the time
<CrystalPhoenix> it's in those MLP commercial
<Vivix> Or just restart
<ApplejackSwag> HHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGG
<Lil_B> GilDash actually, it is actually, especially for a beginner like me
<AssertiveFluttershy1> :P
<Vivix> Like our teacher said, kill your darlings is an important thing to learn, so good on you Lil_B
<Lil_B> Vivix I have about 30 songs, and I know I will not finish one of them anyway :/
<Vivix> it sucks, but it can help
<GilDash> Lil_B: I'm a writer. I might give up on projects, but I always keep them around. You'd be amazed at what can inspire you from old material, and it's nice to reflect once in a while.
<ApplejackSwag> it's been awhile since i've been on the chat
<ApplejackSwag> ya know
<Vivix> That's true too, but you have songs where you know, this isn't good enough, I can't finish this, and deleting them is something that's important to learn
<legendary_brony> Hey, in 1 of the pictures, theres a pony
<Lil_B> Vivix got this advice from a really nice speaker, I may have to kill Stilöl I was working on for hours, but at least I gained knowsledge :/ ... and some presets xD
<Vivix> hehe yeah
<Vivix> Though, I would hide them away, rather than fully demolish
<Punkie_Pue> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaTNrauAcB4 have you heard this yet?
<Vivix> listening to them again in 5 months might be nice to hear progress
<Wrek> 05brony music annoys me nowadays
<Lil_B> GilDash yeah, but writing isn't exactly like composing (though very similar) but it really helps startsing over again, it can be to complex when you resatart and your idea is just gone
<legendary_brony> why
<Wrek> 05its all wananbe wubstep remixes
<String_Shredder> ^
<String_Shredder> ^^^^
<Wrek> 05the original songs are still nice
<Vivix> I only listen to a few artists, never really liked remixes
<ApplejackSwag> heres a nice song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2lncdgW3QA
<CrystalPhoenix> Wrek since when have you made that realization?
<Vivix> if I hear a nice pony song in the show, I avoid all remixes
<Punkie_Pue> I think this was the first remix
<Wrek> 05CrystalPhoenix: since halfway through S2
<DerpyMuffins> Now a days, there are remixes of remixes
<CrystalPhoenix> ApplejackSwag, that's just offspring sped up
<Vivix> I never liked remixes though, outside of pony
<Lil_B> Wrek I don't listen to Brony music... and I'm incabable of doing wubs anyways, I ttry to make some nice synth, use real instrumentss, or Chipstunes
<ApplejackSwag> :D
<CrystalPhoenix> I still say this is one of the best around https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4tyvJJzSDk
<GilDash> Lil_B: It's all a creative artform. If you never keep what you know is wrong, how can you know for sure you've ever improved?
<sonicdude558> Thats it, I am not going to the Bronypalloza panel
<Vivix> I would keep them, but I'd take them out of your WIP folder, Lil_B
<Vivix> it's nice to hear your old stuff
<Vivix> I still have some of my first songs
<Lil_B> GilDash that's the Problem, this was not the only thing the speaker said, there was another important thing thew guy said
<Vivix> m?
<Lil_B> Vivix me too, I have such a Folder :)
<cachi01> Lil_B: yay chiptunes =D
<GilDash> Lil_B: What 'speaker' and what 'guy'?
<Lil_B> GilDash erm... I can link you the Video, he just keeps giving good advice for beginners
<AssertiveFluttershy1> .............................
<ouo> pokehidden also do some normal art c: and i like it
<Wrek> 05i still need to download all of S2
<legendary_brony> ^ oh nooo i was too late
<Wrek> 05i jstu havent been arsed
<ApplejackSwag> I like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDdL4z5qfr4
<ouo> S2?
<cachi01> http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/23550911.jpg
<Punkie_Pue> lol
<GilDash> Lil_B: I just disagree with throwing stuff away if you've worked hard on it, that's all. Sure, archive it away in some box that you will take forever to find again, but if you remove it you can lose more than you know when you do so.
<CrystalPhoenix> ApplejackSwag, song is catchy but meh overall the animation is glorious
<ApplejackSwag> ikr
<Lil_B> GilDash anyway he also said, that, if you finished a song, leave it in that state, don't send it to friends or Stuzff and wait for their feedback, when you say "It's done" than it's done, and that's the version you upload, and than you try better next time
<Lil_B> GilDash yeah, I will keep tham in the WIP or ABandoned folder
<AssertiveFluttershy1> well i'll talk to you guys later
<legendary_brony> I should go to Bronystate....
<AssertiveFluttershy1> gotta go
<GilDash> Lil_B: True. If you try to constantly improve things you never finish it.
<cachi01> cya AssertiveFluttershy1 :)
<Vivix> When as ong is done, it is done, I never go back unless I rerecord them for a new project
<sonicdude558> isn't bronystate off break now?
<cachi01> yep
<alexxm> i think it is
<Vivix> but also, leave it for abot a day and then listen to it again
<legendary_brony> might be
<cachi01> Wrek: just finished streamig some fallout NV
<Vivix> your ears are tired when you've been working
<ouo> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/218/9/d/loki__s_horny_helmet_by_mewmewravan-d5a2kok.jpg
<ApplejackSwag> if you have a tumblr and go on pony ask blogs do you know anynonymous
<Lil_B> Vivix yeah that too
<Vivix> but yeah, done is done is a great advice
<Lil_B> Vivix do you wanna see the Video?
<legendary_brony> Im going to the dentist because my eyes hurt and i cant hear a thing
<Vivix> sure, I'll put it on to watch though
<cachi01> lel
<ApplejackSwag> brb
<Vivix> When I went to school we had a lot of speakers on songwriting and stuff
<legendary_brony> BBQ
<Vivix> one thing still sticks with me, First impression is something you can never have again, so it can be hard to hear the first impression of your own song, and an intro can break your song
<Lil_B> Vivix it's long, but it's good in my opinion, but you may already know this things anyway http://youtu.be/XVQ8c19unnM
<legendary_brony> I like AC/DC
*Vivix puts in to watch
<legendary_brony> and turtles
<Vivix> I've grown fond of grunge, like- Melvins and Mudhoney, and Motorpsycho the past few months
<ApplejackSwag> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbWFaI3d9D8 the voices aren't that great but that animation <3
<legendary_brony> ...
<ApplejackSwag> anypony there?
<legendary_brony> me
<ApplejackSwag> okay
<Vivix> Ill methodology- never heard of IllGatesmusic, but I'll be sure to watch it
<legendary_brony> *forever alone face*
<ApplejackSwag> what did everypony get for christmas I got a kindle fire
*Vivix strokes the forever alone face
<Punkie_Pue> Windows 8
<ApplejackSwag> nice
<Punkie_Pue> amazon gift card and gloves
<cachi01> wii u, zombi U, scribblenauts unlimited, 100 dollars
<ApplejackSwag> wow
<Punkie_Pue> Nice
<legendary_brony> My christmas i was sleeping blissfully until my mother smacked me in the face with a new laptop to awake me
<Lil_B> cachi01 got the same, except the WiiU, ZombiU and scribblenauts
<cachi01> legendary_brony: awesome
<legendary_brony> yeah
<legendary_brony> or should say YEEEEEAAAHHH
<ApplejackSwag> was it windows 8
<legendary_brony> yes
<Punkie_Pue> How do you like 8?
<ApplejackSwag> my brothers got the same
<Punkie_Pue> Do you miss the start menu?
<legendary_brony> its confusing me but i like it
<legendary_brony> yes
<ApplejackSwag> so are any admins on?
<legendary_brony> yes
<ApplejackSwag> whens next stream?
<legendary_brony> 2 days i think
<Vivix> They're unschedueled
<ApplejackSwag> oh
<legendary_brony> sooo its just us 3?
<jcelios> hai
*Vivix aves
<legendary_brony> nvm
<Punkie_Pue> hello
<ApplejackSwag> hai jcelios
<legendary_brony> nvm again
<jcelios> 128 pokemans
<Lil_B> Vivix though, one point he makes is that collaborating with others is a nice way to improve on a lot of things... but I can't find anyone :/
<legendary_brony> 6 of us
<ApplejackSwag> If I were a pony I'd be a Pegasus named Fire Drizzle
<Vivix> well, I've yet to collaborate in pony world, but school was all abot collaboration
<ApplejackSwag> or alicorn
<legendary_brony> if i was a pony id be a black pegasus named night wing
<Vivix> I think collaboration over the internet sounds difficult, but I'd like to try it some day
<jcelios> I'd be an alicorn named Omega Black and started a harem
<jcelios> and fight goku
<legendary_brony> with a scar and bitten ear
<jcelios> yup
<cachi01> jcelios: dont forget being a lost broher of celestia
<CrystalPhoenix> legendary_brony, don't forget the red mane
<jcelios> now *this* is what I call collaboration
<ApplejackSwag> I'd have a fire blue coat & lime green mane with black highlights
<legendary_brony> its actually blue but you knoow
<Vivix> I wonder if Falvie could make an alicorn oc look good
<Lil_B> Vivix I know some people near me whomake music too, but I just never really come together with asnyone to collaborater :/ maybe I should just speak with them :/
<Vivix> maybe- you know them?
<legendary_brony> the scar on my left eye and bitten left ear
<Vivix> Jamming and impro is a great way to test your skills and get a feel for who you are in music
<ApplejackSwag> my cutie mark is a blue fire ball with lighting striking it
<ApplejackSwag> :)
<CrystalPhoenix> I love my OC
<Punkie_Pue> I think mine would be a flash drive
<ApplejackSwag> :D
<CrystalPhoenix> he has a transparent coat with invisible mane
<ApplejackSwag> so your good with computers
<legendary_brony> cutie mark: sorta of a guardian's emblem
<Punkie_Pue> Id like to think so.
<Vivix> I'd like mine to be the stereotypical G-Key
<Lil_B> Vivix 2 of them are in my class, but both have a lot of other things to do and don't have much time, and the last one is in my village, but I don't have that much of a connection to him and he also has a rather busy life
<CrystalPhoenix> you know
<ApplejackSwag> who's your favorite background pony?
<legendary_brony> *guardians angel emblem
<CrystalPhoenix> I personally think it's very odd to have a tool as a cutiemark
<cachi01> applejack
<ApplejackSwag> background
<jcelios> probably Derpy
<cachi01> applejack
<Punkie_Pue> Does derpy count?
<Vivix> Aah, well- collaboration online is another way to learn, I'm not very sociable, but you could probably find a music club or- hangout to meet people to play with
<sonicdude558> a cutie mark tool? To remove cutie marks?
<ApplejackSwag> yes
<legendary_brony> octavia
<Vivix> like in real life, but you could also try online, just to see how it is
<ApplejackSwag> mine is Rose Luck
<cachi01> http://oi45.tinypic.com/1hv9t.jpg one does not simply beat my oc
<Octavia> legendary_brony, sup

<Punkie_Pue> I dont know of any public servers that are good
<Vivix> probably some good whitelist ones out there
<Punkie_Pue> Yeah!
<Punkie_Pue> Thats your best bet
<Vivix> but usually a closed community can make it weird to enter as the new person
<Punkie_Pue> Or get some friends who play and rent a server.
<Socks> oK, i'll start checking out Whitelist stuff
<SmokeW33d420tacosaladALLDAY> cool
<legendary_brony> i type really slow compared to other people....

<sonicdude558> I heard its a group of furfags

<Rex_Mundi> sonicdude558: thats it, Bronies are Furries then. it means they watch anime.

<Vivix> Look at it this way, no fursuits, no Narnia
<sonicdude558> ewww
<legendary_brony> i had oxygen last night.... it was good until i released carbon dioxide
<Punkie_Pue> Oxygen is overrated.
<cachi01> ''dad i just came out of the closet''
<legendary_brony> yeah it asntt pretty
<cachi01> ''son''
<cachi01> ''tell me how is narnia''
<sonicdude558> a girl walks into a wardrobe thing, and she falls asleep at the amount of fursuits inside of it
<Vivix> I wouldn't mind dating a furry-
<cachi01> ^

<Rex_Mundi> DRHUnleashed: You get to date all the seaponies.
<Punkie_Pue> I dont see a download button
<cachi01> J_E_Smith71: cant find it
<Vivix> Youtube might make it available based on region
<Vivix> I had the new layou for a month or so before it went live, you might need to be in the html5 beta as well
<Kimori> Meth always comes up with interesting names
<Punkie_Pue> What region are you from J_E_Smith71?
<DRHUnleashed> i'm unsure whether this is a good thing or not
<thelonecubone|BL2> or actually, i'll play some GTA4 ^w^
<J_E_Smith71> cachi01: I'm wondering if its something to do with my account
<ouo> Rex_Mundi, he's too shy :\ doesn't talk much
<Vivix> it might also need to be enabled by the uploader
<cachi01> J_E_Smith71: maybe
<spyrofan001> 6Meth?
<Kimori> yeah, hes a new guy that has been coming here
<cachi01> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWtO0cfgewY cant find the button in here
<legendary_brony> Id rather date cray pinki- * remembers Cupcakes* never mind
<Vivix> I can't see it either, I'm in html5 beta and region europe north
<J_E_Smith71> Every video I'm looking at has the button so fat
<J_E_Smith71> far
<J_E_Smith71> I'm in the US
<Rex_Mundi> Id date Rarity
<Punkie_Pue> could it be a plugin?
<legendary_brony> so you think rarity= best pony
*ouo pokes sombra
<Vivix> Probably region
<CrystalPhoenix> but rarity is best pony
<Punkie_Pue> I have g3 rarity according to Rex_Mundi
<Rex_Mundi> legendary_brony: The mane6 are equally best pony
<Punkie_Pue> All ponies are created equally.
<legendary_brony> silver spoon is best pony
<Vivix> Except earth ponies
<Vivix> I adore Silver Spook and Diamond-
<Punkie_Pue> ^
<Kimori> Someone bought me a spyro plush for christmas
<Vivix> Spoon*
<ouo> earth ponies are slaves
<Punkie_Pue> I feel earth ponies kind of got screwed
<Spyrorocks[Air]> pics
<Vivix> well, Earth Ponies are really strong, they are equal in ability
<Vivix> but it's a joke that goes around
<Rex_Mundi> Earth ponies are more in thouch with nature n. stuff. They are ponyverse elevs kinda
<Kimori> alright, ill try taking a pic of it later today
<J_E_Smith71> Wonder if its a plugin on this laptop I'm using
<ouo> i thought ponies fight with power of friendship
<Vivix> They are also seemingly (so far) the only ones who can cultivate plants and earth
<cachi01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRNzhOhE6sQ
<Vivix> I've yet to see anyone else actually grow something, but I don't know for sure
<legendary_brony> they are the most independable becuae they are in charge of food pegasus andunicorns are not.
<ouo> Harry Potter is gay >_>
<r-dash> helllo
<DerpyMuffins> Celestia= Slave driver
<legendary_brony> herro
<Gekoncze> Yay! I would like to have Spyro plush too.
<ouo> no really
<ouo> he's fag
<legendary_brony> *Trollestia
<Punkie_Pue> What can unicorn magic not do?
<thelonecubone> okay, somethings wrong with my Xbox 360 D:
<MLP_Brovakiin> D:
<Punkie_Pue> Whats wrong thelonecubone?
<legendary_brony> o no
<cachi01> thelonecubone: same here
<Stormy> I have one already :D
<Rex_Mundi> The whole thing that people are saying that Twilight will become an Alicorn, doesnt that work with the other ponies. Can a pegasus become an Alicorn, or an earth pony? Its one of the reasons why i dislike that Twilight Alicorn theory.
<Stormy> You can buy them on ebay

*RaveBrony waves to MLP_Brovakiin
<thelonecubone> Good morning RaveBrony :)
<ouo> want to kill*
<RaveBrony> Hey thelonecubone :$
<MadSurge> Hello RaveBrony! Had a merry Christmas? :)
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Then, after about 7 days of my torrid affair with the Galaxy S3, it came to a screeching halt, when my phone (which was nestled safely in my robe pocket… or so I thought), came flying out of that pocket as if it had grown some kind of consciousness, and landed itself right in the toilet
<Rex_Mundi> MadSurge: http://maxiburger.tumblr.com/post/37445812704/what-japan-thinks-of-mlp122-with-timestamps
<RaveBrony> I did indeed, MadSurge! How about you??
<Gekoncze> :D
<Cypresswolf> I had a nice relaxing day :) - I might be in trouble later, but worth it!
<MadSurge> RaveBrony: had a huge feast with my relatives, played with my little cousin, got a brand new laptop... yes I did!
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: thanks a lot!
<RaveBrony> MadSurge: Awesome! :o
<legendary_brony> In the rainbow factory, where fears and horros come true.
<ouo> this little horsie kissing me
<Spyrorocks[Air]> My grandpa signed a new contract and got a galaxy s3
<Spyrorocks[Air]> a week later he smashed it
<ouo> giddy up giddy up giddy up up
<Spyrorocks[Air]> by accident of course...
<legendary_brony> In the rainbow factory, where not a single soul gets through
<Spyrorocks[Air]> but that sort of sucks, $250 to replace a busted screen
<Spyrorocks[Air]> snowing here.
<Stormy> I almost killed my S2 with wet laundry
<Ponyguy> Funniest fan fic I've ever read
<Rex_Mundi> One thing I noticed using Google translate, is that names get warped translated back into english. Selestia become "Seresutia"
<Stormy> but it recovered somehow
<Ponyguy> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24941/the-fraternal-brotherhood-of-mann
<Rex_Mundi> Celestia become Seresutia, I mean
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Spyrorocks[Air]> samsung phones are usually really resilliant
<Kimori> Are the screens glass?
<Spyrorocks[Air]> but if they get hit in just the right place....
<Spyrorocks[Air]> yes, gorilla glass I believe.
<Rex_Mundi> Why is Sumicas OC pony so sexy?
<ouo> this little horse travel Hong Kong
<Rex_Mundi> whatevs
<Spyrorocks[Air]> luckily I have never damaged any of my phones
<Rex_Mundi> What was I gonna do?.. alright... homework.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> knock on wood.
<Ponyguy> bored..
<Rex_Mundi> guhhhhr
<thelonecubone> well go do something then pony_26
<Stormy> just don't a phone in your pocket with a package of fish hooks
<thelonecubone> Ponyguy*
<Gekoncze> My grandpa cooked his mobilephone on a stove and it still worked after that. It was some very old model which had an anntena and 2 color display :)
<Stormy> I destroyed on of my phones' screens that ways
<Stormy> *way
<Stormy> yeah those old phones were unbreakable
<Gekoncze> yeah
<Stormy> my parents used to have them
<Stormy> I always asked to borrow them to play snake :P
<Gekoncze> :D
<Spyrorocks[Air]> lol old nokia snake
<Kimori> haha I remember snake
<Kimori> its still a fun game
<Spyrorocks[Air]> i still remember the ringtones from those phones
<Spyrorocks[Air]> not because I had one but because my parents did,
<Ponyguy> You think they'll ever say who Celestia and Luna's parents are
<killerpony7733> Doubtful
<Ponyguy> same thing with AJ
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/sjwtL.jpg

<thelonecubone> oh shit
<legendary_brony> yes

<Spyrorocks[Air]> its their fault for being a little pissy crybaby over nothing.
<thelonecubone> damn it brain >_<
<thelonecubone> Shizuka: :D
<Stormy> that's true
<Ponyguy> I couldn't see big mac the same after that
<killerpony7733> Ponyguy Yes and i suggest stopping there cause rules say no gorefics talk here
<Spyrorocks[Air]> those faces on those phones creep me out
<legendary_brony> the below person below me is typing in english
<killerpony7733> Ponyguy I strongly suggest you read the rules and FAQ if you haven't
<legendary_brony> told ya
<ouo> my dad said shut the fuck giddy up
<ouo> :\
<Stormy> I remember that ringtone
<Gekoncze> me too
<Spyrorocks[Air]> I still like the first original one the best
<Kandarihu> Hey guys. I'm on the road, and IT IS BRUTAL OUT HERE!
<Kimori> yeah the original is still good
<legendary_brony> the person below me is a brony
<Kandarihu> I'm a brony
<Cypresswolf> Ponyguy: Celestia & Luna's parents are as of yet, unknown, but I have my suspiscions - Sun & Moon - Time & Space
<ouo> what road?
<Spyrorocks[Air]> "Last week, we ran a post with advice for families bringing kids to visit Santa, written by a former mall Santa who got the job despite being skinny, thirtyish, and Jewish."
<Lil_B> legendary_brony what if I turn my Monitor upside down?
<GilDash> Kandarihu: Stay safe. Hoping you have a safe trip, if not pleasant.
<legendary_brony> umm damn i dint think abou that
<ouo> oh
<Spyrorocks[Air]> http://consumerist.com/2012/12/26/it-really-is-a-business-why-taking-your-own-santa-visit-pictures-makes-you-a-cheap-jerk/
<Spyrorocks[Air]> wow that would be embarassing.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> taking your own photos in their set and paying them nothing
<thelonecubone> stay safe Kandarihu :)
<Spyrorocks[Air]> what a cheap ass.
<ouo> what road ?!
<legendary_brony> wait its still a brony
<Kimori> lol
<Cypresswolf> I gotta start staying in one place for more than 5 minutes...too much back log to go through...
<ouo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFgR0m-9FmM
<Lil_B> I can't wait for the Turrican Soundtrack Anthology to come out... oh the sweet sweet 90's Synths :(
<legendary_brony> its a paddlin
<Spyrorocks[Air]> anyways time to get out of bed..
<Kimori> I love that topic name
<legendary_brony> who wnt to be a gremmar nazi?
<thelonecubone> Grammar*
<Punkie_Pue2> who wants a flugel horn?
<legendary_brony> *want
<AdamTheDuck> Heil grammar!
*AdamTheDuck salhoofs
<legendary_brony> Heil grammar!
<Stormy> I never did those Santa visits as a kid
*Bronysith carries AdamTheDuck to bed
<ouo> i want a flugelhorn
<Lil_B> why do I think it's aktually "Flügel Horn" but the americans just thought "skrew the Ü and their Pronounciation, but let's keep the word around anyways"
<legendary_brony> cee ya
<Brad__> I did
<Brad__> a few times
<Stormy> My parents never taught us to believe in Santa
<Punkie_Pue2> who else wants a flugel horn?
<ouo> i don't know anything bout Ü :P
<legendary_brony> i want a flugel horn!!
<Brad__> I wouldn't teach my kids about santa
<Stormy> When I tell people this they usually say something like "OMG how did you have a childhood!?"
<Brad__> I dont think its cute or funny.
<Stormy> but it seemed perfectly normal
<AdamTheDuck> Bronysith, funny you should say that, I'mma head back to sleep, just woke up to check downloads :P
<legendary_brony> Ponies nuff said
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck xD hello and sleep well
<Brad__> Id rather tell them the truth as to give myself more creditability when they are older.
<Brad__> yeah, im pretty dry :P
<Stormy> lol
<thelonecubone> Sleep well AdamTheDuck :3
<Stormy> I would just rather Christmas not be just about getting stuff for them
<Stormy> that was my parents' reasoning, makes sense
<ouo> http://curezone.com/upload/_A_Forums/Ask_Ana/Ana_Fun/Thats_a_paddlin.jpg
<Brad__> yeah totally.
<Punkie_Pue2> I think in season 4 they should get an hour time slot.
<legendary_brony> sleep tight dont let the bedbugs kill ya slowly
<Brad__> This year my mom put icing sugar on the floor and told my little sister that santa was here
<ekips> good evening
<Brad__> Im like... since when does santa throw icing sugar all over?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye AdamTheDuck :)
<Kimori> wow
<ouo> i think g5 should get 18+ rate
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai ekips :)
<Stormy> Hohoho, have fun cleaning up your house!
<Kimori> Thats just original though
<Brad__> she does funny things like that.
<thelonecubone> Hi ekips :)
<Kimori> never heard anyone doing that
*Bronysith dances in a gala suit
<Stormy> :P
<Brad__> and she put celery and said santa took a bite of the celery
<Brad__> Im like... since when does santa want celery?
<ouo> and been showed after 11 00 pm o////o
<Kimori> If all your snacks end up missing in the house blame santa
<Stormy> he's on a diet
<Brad__> thats what she said.
<Brad__> and I just responded with "unlikely."
<Punkie_Pue> I think we should have more 2 parters.
<Brad__> My mom is funny though, she just wants to make things fun in her own way
<thelonecubone> Bronysith: Nice suit :)
<Lil_B> I demand a MLP Movie... but I want to finally get an a compelling non-stereotypical villian, some actrion and Characterdevelopment.
<Bronysith> Lil_B: you wont get that with the current writers
<Punkie_Pue> Well get a moive when the mlp fandom starts to decline
<Lil_B> Bronysith yeah, S3 really disappointed me so far...
<Kandarihu> Alright. I don't see any way to charge my battery, and I'm down to about 28%. So I'll see you next time I stop off somewhere else. I hope I can recharge the battery.
<alexxm|colt> how come Lil_B
<GilDash> Kandarihu: See you around. :)
<Bronysith> Lil_B: so far it has been just fanservice and action since the season 2 finale
<Bronysith> no character development or good writing
<Lil_B> alexxm|colt the Writing, it has become really predictable and/or Fanservice
<Bronysith> just, fanservice and action
<Punkie_Pue> SPitefires character was all over the place if i recall
<Stormy> sometimes I wish Spyrochat was not called Spyrochat
<Stormy> So kids wouldn't come in thinking we only talk about Spyro and nothing else
<Kimori> What would you call it?
<Stormy> I dunno :P
<Bronysith> at least applejack has a song...but they friggin put no effort into it
<Punkie_Pue> I didn't think the song was bad.
<Lil_B> I would actually call this episode with the Wonderbolts not so bad, but man, you saw that "Lesson" coming from a mile away, and the way they just kinda kicked Lightnighdust out was rather uneventful
<Lil_B> btw, when was the last time you actually had someone qwriting a letter to the Princess?
<Stormy> I don't really think we should change it
<GilDash> Lil_B: Uh, last episode, actually. XD
<Bronysith> Lil_B: only applejack and pinkie pie so far this season
<Lil_B> GilDash damnit... before that?
<Stormy> but it would probably get rid of that
<Kimori> We are getting more newcomers
<Kimori> I think the skylanders generation is a bit too young right now
<Stormy> most of them figure out pretty quick that we're not all about Spyro
<GilDash> Lil_B: No idea. XD
<Stormy> Yeah
<Bronysith> Lil_B: in the pinkie pie episode
<Stormy> And I don't blame them, but some kids that young just shouldn't be on the internet
<Bronysith> and applejack, that is it the entire fucking season
<VenHur> ...Ever thought about an episode about a villain that camed straight from "Heck"? ...*Cough* The PG-rated way to say "Hell".
<Bronysith> only 2 letters this season
<Lil_B> Applejacks Episode was horrible for me to watch, I just can't stand easily avoidable awkwardness
<Stormy> there are much worse things than someone making fun of your favorit video game
<Stormy> if they can't even take that...
<Bronysith> Lil_B: eh, the studio hates applejack remember?
<Kimori> You know you enjoyed it
<GilDash> Lil_B: Disregard Applejack; Aquire Braeburn.
<Stormy> enjoyed what?
<Stormy> making that kid mad?
<Kimori> yeah
<VenHur> Okay, if you guys wanted a episode that can makes your jaws drop like no tomorrow, then why don't you listen to MY idea?
<Kimori> well maybe enjoy is not the best word to use
<Stormy> well I dunno
<Kimori> but you said you missed it
<Lil_B> Bronysith I don't think they hate anyone, judging by how I saw the episodes, but they write it just poorly >.< like giving rarity actual generosity
<Stormy> that was 95% sarcasm :P
<Lil_B> VenHur I had a Good Idea once, but I forgot it :P
<Kimori> You enjoy sarcasm
<Kimori> :D
<Stormy> now that is definitely true
<Stormy> although I wish it was easier to detect on the internet
<GilDash> VenHur: Haven't they already got Tarturus?
<VenHur> Well Lil_B, my idea is an "jumping the shark in an cosmic sort of way"ish idea, and yes, it's a two-parter...
<Kimori> I tend to miss the sarcasm often
<Lil_B> VenHur xD
<Stormy> I think you have to know the person really well
<Stormy> like if it's something they would obviously never say, it's probably sarcasm
<Lil_B> https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6878859008/hFC420297/
<VenHur> You see, 1000 years ago, ANOTHER villain named Diablo, a monstrous 50ft demon that clarrifed to many as "The King of All Sins", or "The Demon King" had broken from his prisonment one day.
<thelonecubone> i just realized something, It was that little box that keeps the power for the xbox :$
<VenHur> On that day, Diablo requested a challenge to the Mane 6, if they would won, Diablo would be sent to the sun to be burned to the crisp.
<Lil_B> VenHur will there be a Cow Level like in Diabolo?
<VenHur> And if Diablo wons...well, let's just say that until death, EVERY single ponies in Equestria will bowed down to thier new overlord, even Celestia herself.
<VenHur> And I DO means, EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.
<Lil_B> errrrr... okey...
<VenHur> ...So...how's my idea?
<Lil_B> unimaginable for MLP xD
<thelonecubone> Lil_B: Is that Fiona, the R63 version of Finn?
<Lil_B> but now I remembered my Idea I had : D
<thelonecubone> because it does look like her :D
<Lil_B> thelonecubone why do you ask me something about r63?! ... btw, I think so
<VenHur> Hey, at least my episodic idea is as grimdark as A Canterlot Wedding, hell, maybe it can goe BEYOND that standards.
<GilDash> Ponies aren't exactly grimdark though. That's not the point of the show.

<Lil_B> Random Trivia: All Main Console Zelda Gmes used the same Engine since the Wind Waker up to Skyward Sword, just minor tweaks were done
<VenHur> Random Nintendo Logic Theory: Why can't brick that Mario breaks hurts his head?
<VenHur> *bricks
<Lil_B> because he attacks their Weakpoint for massive damage
<VenHur> Another Random Nintendo Theory: If Mario felled down a hole in the Overworld, shouldn't that one hole leads straight to the Underworld?
<Lil_B> nope, the holes usually have no connection to the underworld, the ceiling in the underworlds are usually void of holes in them
<Shizuka> 13mario punches blocks, not his head
<Lil_B> ^ that too, if you looks very closly at screenshots
<Bronysith> it would still hurt to punch blocks
<Bronysith> made of fuggin brick
<VenHur> Shizuka: Still, if you punched a block in the real world, it would of clenchs your hand. And really, that is painful.
<Shizuka> 13mario eats a mushroom and grows larger
<Shizuka> 13i don't think his hand cares
<Spyrofan001> hey
<Gekoncze> hi amu-chan and spyrofan

<Amu-chan> Hi!

<Saturn> 08,01i want to come out to my parents
