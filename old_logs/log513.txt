<Saturn> 08,01Panda: i'm not sure, but probably
<SolairePony89> hen3ry: Oh, right 6_9
<hen3ry> recursiveness is recursive.
<Panda> Saturn: xD
<junh1024-XD> in http://myanimelist.net/anime/8675/Seitokai_Yakuindomo < they even mention specific pages of the manga in the NE{
<Ponies47> Is sad now and feals ignored :(

<Saturn> 08,01definition of recursion: see recursion
<cow334> Ponies47: MAAAN I OVE YOU
<Panda> Saturn: wait... did this happen twice already or are you just repeating about the first time :)
<drf|laptop> 03I'm not watching NEPs, fairly pointless if I can just open the next ep
<lakingsfans> I'M B ACK
<Panda> lakingsfans: that was quick
<Capn_Gavn> saturn should call himself swag-urn when he is telling us about his adventures
<SolairePony89> Ponies47: What was your question?
<Ponies47> I feal ignored because no pony answered my question :(
<User0> Saturn: Are you thinking about thinking about thinking about thinking about...
<Polydunami> Ugh, when I think of the word recursion, I think of ENDLESS EIGHT :|
<Sylandest> Ponies47: what was your question
<lakingsfans> ehh 5 hour energy
<Yahooz> Ponies47: what would that be?
<junh1024-XD> watch at least 1 NEP in the beginning of the season. the style is unique to PA
<Saturn> 08,01Sylandest: it's not just work, it's the con too. and this past few days, i've had 3 other people say that. but i don't have time to take time off now
<hen3ry> Polydunami: gah!
<Polydunami> Exactly
<Ponies47> Ok If I can convert 3 poeple in bronies would 4 bronies working together could they make somebody else into one? 6_9
<Saturn> 08,01but i've said i'll rest next weekend
<junh1024-XD> and sometimes the NEP contains unique content not in NEXT or CUR_MAIN_B
<drf|laptop> 03PA?
<|Discord|> Bai everypony*Yawns*
<junh1024-XD> PA works
<Saturn> 08,01but first, i need to work extra hard this week

<Panda> Ponies47: yeah, but you cant over do it
<cow334> Saturn: if you want to know what gose on in my mind watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CWD84MHmM8
<Yahooz> Ponies47: ...most likely?
<Sylandest> Saturn: Then make use of the time you got. You said you have that access card to use, right? Make use of it to do what you can. Get the work done and done so you can relax again
<junh1024-XD> AB is PAw's first anime as primary animators
<SolairePony89> Ponies47: If one brony can convert others, then hell yeah 4 can
<junh1024-XD> previously they used to draw mainly backgrounds
<lakingsfans> i came back on my mobile i'm accually laying in bed while doing this
<hen3ry> You know, tho... if they were ever dumb enough to make me a mod - and I was foalish enough to agree - I would totally stream endless eight.

<KiwiBoi777> Ninjazz: Lol indeed
<MadSurge> Hi Ninjazz! :$
<Om> Ninjazz: Technology
<Ninjazz> Hey there, MadSurge! :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> If a friend does catch you watching MLP then ok kool, if he's interested about it then that's great

<Ninjazz> Om, Superman defeats it.

<Alchemist> Ponies47: Im really sorry to trample over your enthusiasm, but CrimsonPhoenix is right.

<MadSurge> Ninjazz: Lollipop Chainsaw is awesome!
<Ninjazz> Hey there, Ponies47. :)

<xxMoopyxx> i said i DO NOT CLOP TO PONIES! :[
<Ponies47> Yes they may not like it but it never hurts to atleast try right? No force. Just see if they wanna watch an episode.
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, it's fine. :$
<DJ_PINK-3> AR U SHURE?
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: Tara had so much fun recording her lines, you can tell :D
<Ponies47> I'm not gonna stuff it down there throats
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I can imagine. :D
<[B]JRP2234> i need a spot in a voice acting thing
<KiwiBoi777> Ponies47: good boi
<Ponies47> KiwiBoi777: Can I have a treat!?!
<Ninjazz> lol Lex Standee.
<Vordox> Phase4: Reminds me of the Beyond Good and Evil Puzzle. :P
<Alchemist> Ponies47: if they spend some time on teh interwebz I assume they have already encountered the show in some form. If they havent watched it by now then they are probably not interested
<KiwiBoi777> Ponies47: of course you can:D
<Vordox> And Kotor
<xxMoopyxx> i just watch them of enjoyment jeeze guys
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ponies47 that's fine but you don't have to HOPE them to catch you
<lakingsfans> i used to have this game but i never knew there were this many glitches in here
<Ponies47> KiwiBoi777: YAY! *Noms on treat*
<CrimsonPhoenix> that ain't a good mentality
<DJ_PINK-3> this game is mean to people with dyslexia
<Mutterguy> g'day!
<Om> Seems legit
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: Yes I know. I would rather be an accident that wasen't planed
<Ponies47> Like when I told my mom. That was planed
<MadSurge> Nice boss fight!
<Alchemist> .Ponies47: why not just ask them in conversation? Isnt that a bit more... easy?
<lakingsfans> seems legit
<Shamroc> SUPERPOCKET
<lakingsfans> endless pocket of doom?
<Om> just like ponies
<Ponies47> Alchemist: Talk is good. I should atleast try that. They don't know that I'm a brony
<CrimsonPhoenix> well Alchemist considering the target demographic I doubt that would be easy
<Mutterguy> the stream is down?
<MahBoi777> nope
<[B]JRP2234> has my stream taking a shit again
<lakingsfans> just like all the boss fights in old games
<Irish_Pony> :D
<MahBoi777> hey Mutterguy
<MadSurge> Mutterguy: no, it's on
<Om> Pans cant spell
<MahBoi777> it's a fact
<[B]JRP2234> Phase4: y i has no stream
<Phase4> 00,02not sure
<Mutterguy> Ok because I was about to post a Beaurepaires ad
<lakingsfans> BEST BOSS FIGHT EVER!
<MadSurge> GREAT BOSS FIGHT

<Ponies47> *Looks at clock* hmm 3:03 AM. Yeah I should TRY and get some sleep so.....
<[B]JRP2234> Phase4: i think mips embed has dun goofed
<Ponies47> GOOD NIGHT EVERYPONY!
<Ponies47> :)
<Mutterguy> it's a very kiwi advert
<Alchemist> CrimsonPhoenix: the facts are the same regardless of you bringing it up in conversation, or they "catch" you watching it. The mindset of the "target" is the same in both situations.
<xxMoopyxx> night ponies
<BroKnee> Night Ponies47 <3 wubz
<MahBoi777> gnight Ponies47! sleep well!:)
<lakingsfans> this boss fight was really hard it took me all day to beat it

*MahBoi777 hugs Ponies47 back
<mario_pony> he said it he must be a brony :P
<Om> This game is a glitch
<lakingsfans> he has no idea what he said
<CrimsonPhoenix> Alchemist, you got a point, but for the whole catching one watching the show I was thinking about the animation and the characterization that the "intruder" would be welcomed into
<Shamroc> nigth Ponies47
<[B]JRP2234> Phase4: please changed embeds
*BroKnee Huggues Poies47
<Mutterguy> the refresh button! it does nothing!
<BroKnee> Ponies47 xD
<Phase4> 00,02k
<Phase4> 00,02time to reboot
<Ponies47> HE GONE!
<OtakuTom> Om, I think it's the other way around. I'm pretty sure it's actually a glitch that people think is a game.
<Shamroc> Phase4....oh my god that was some funny stuff
<Phase4> 00,02[B]JRP2234, Mutterguy: it may have been the way mips works
<Phase4> 00,02will probably work fine when tf2
<lakingsfans> he said jumping like a pony but ponies don't jump that way on the other hand he should have said stop jumping like pinkie pie cause that was pinkie pie jumping :D
<MahBoi777> dat manly chest
<Mutterguy> tf2? better start up steam now...
<xxMoopyxx> Hey cow334 brb im going to go make me some fruit snacks to get ready to go watch MLP episodes reactions ok
<Om> OtakuTom: I don't see why it cant be some of both. Off topic, his chest looks very pointy
<XAX> Anyone here play CrossFire? :l
<BroKnee> I'll brb everypony :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/iB42I.jpg
<[B]JRP2234> Phase4: mips is refusing to let me watch
<cow334> xxMoopyxx: kk
<xxMoopyxx> cool brb
<MahBoi777> Om: it cud poke an eye out
<lakingsfans> is it wrong to say what is tf2?
<Om> MahBoi777: Superpoke!
<MahBoi777> xD
<[B]JRP2234> Phase4: stop and restart stream
<Crispmilk> Oh god, this room too!?!?
<lakingsfans> my eyes are focusing out of vision
<lakingsfans> is that a good thing?
<MahBoi777> whuzzat Crispmilk?
<Ninjazz> Sometimes. >.>
<Phase4> 00,02havent started streaming yet
<lakingsfans> my eyes are sad :(
<Alchemist> CrimsonPhoenix: I dont think seeing the animation would change the affiliation, because the first impression is not aesthetical, its about content. He will see colourful ponies and make a judgement by that.
<MahBoi777> lakingsfans: don fall asleep during stream/nonstream!
<Om> lakingsfans: Have them drink orangejuice
<MahBoi777> I do that too often
<lakingsfans> i'm trying not to!
<[B]JRP2234> Phase4: i see it
<lakingsfans> i'm telling my eyes to stay awake
<lakingsfans> or they will pay
<Phase4> 00,02are you guys getting a stream
<Om> Yup!
<MahBoi777> listen to me eyeballz!
<Crispmilk> Clear on my end
<Phase4> 00,02i cant see my own stream XD
<[B]JRP2234> Phase4: just change embeds
<MahBoi777> yea I see it lol
<Om> Thats bad
<Shamroc> yeah were gettin it
<diddutz> Phase4: i has stream
<Phase4> 00,02oh there it is
<[B]JRP2234> i think mips is having problems again
<Phase4> 00,02[B]JRP2234, yours working?
<lakingsfans> my eyes are disloyal
<[B]JRP2234> now it is
<MahBoi777> yo dawg, we heard u like streams
<Om> And streamception begins
<CrimsonPhoenix> Alchemist, but at least they will be in place and the chance might be higher to present not only the content but also the quality behind the whole show.
<Alchemist> CrimsonPhoenix: I think seeing the show from afar on a screen by surprise and bringing it up in convo doesnt change the person's mindset.
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: Look what you have done! Now the screens will go on forever!!!!
<Vordox> I see windows D:
<lakingsfans> how can i fall asleep when i'm laughing at all this :D
<MahBoi777> we put streams in your streams so u can stream while u stream
<Shamroc> BEEP...my ears bleed now
<MadSurge> Desktop Ponies! :3
<lakingsfans> ponies there the best eyedrops
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, you there?
<Vordox> Phase4: Untagged
<Ninjazz> Dat quick responce. XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> It won't no but at least they would already be there instead of desperately attempting to drag them to your computer screen and set them to watch an episode
<Om> lakingsfans: Until I read your name, I thought it said laughing gas
<Mutterguy> Phase4, it's working
<Mutterguy> for me that is
<Vordox> Phase4: Also, that Timing again :P
<lakingsfans> that to
<Ninjazz> Dem PMs.
<MahBoi777> Om: that's not a bad name actually
<[B]JRP2234> Phase4: can i share a video link
<Vordox> Ninjazz: OH SHUSH it's PRIVATE stuff :P
<Ninjazz> >.>
<Ninjazz> <.<
<CrimsonPhoenix> I remember I was watching Philomena episode and my 24 years old brother came in and watch a good couple of minutes of it
<Om> MahBoi777: That is why I never took the time to read it xD
<Ninjazz> I saw nothing, Vordox. XD
<MahBoi777> xD
<lakingsfans> you know what suck the heads means?
<MahBoi777> brb
<CrimsonPhoenix> he did seem intrigued by the quality but of course he's not into cartoon anymore
<Phase4> 00,02brb
<Om> Ninjazz: U saw. Teh wurld
<lakingsfans> it's about eatinjg
<Ninjazz> lakingsfans, it's about eating.
<Ninjazz> Damn it.
<lakingsfans> you see i was with my buddy keith once
<Vordox> The phase pony is untagged catalogue
<Alchemist> CrimsonPhoenix: if the person is interested in quality over content, you can also say in convo that "hey the show's animation/audio etc qualities are awesome" and he will still be interested. What Im trying to say that everyone have a certain mindset and you cant change that. Its like trying to see if an atheist will convert to christianity by trying to talk to him and bringing him into a sunday mass.
<Ninjazz> Om, and teh world... scared me.
<Phase4> 00,02urgh
<Glacymr> yay
<Phase4> 00,02things have gone wrong
*Glacymr pets Espeon
<Om> Ninjazz: Shh shh shh, Pinkie will be her to show you it isn't that bad :3
<Phase4> 00,02bbl
<[B]JRP2234> you know how bored i got
<lakingsfans> BOO!
<[B]JRP2234> http://youtu.be/uewKXpDxFGk
<lakingsfans> why u stop stream
<[B]JRP2234> THATS HOW BORED I WAS
<Ninjazz> Don't worry, Phase4, you could just have Rarity on instead and things should be good. :3
<Mutterguy> oh phase4 got the kerbal Space program demo. i can happily get into space but two of my attempts have netted my a planetoid...
<Mutterguy> *me
<lakingsfans> going to space is a bitch
<Ninjazz> Om, now I feel like singing. :D
<Om> Ninjazz: Sing it brothah!
<Irish_Pony> well im gonna go to bed, night!
<Alchemist> CrimsonPhoenix: also sorry for arguing this early, had a terrible night.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and what I've been trying to say is that there's still a better chance to catch an interest to that person if he catch you watching the show. A better chance doesn't mean a definite
<Om> Irish_Pony: Sleep well~
<Ninjazz> Night, Irish. Take care.
<OtakuTom> I got KSP and can't even get airborne with a spaceplane >_>
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm not upset nor angry
<Ninjazz> Om, the brother is sleeping. :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> this is quite an intelligent discussion
<Om> Ninjazz: Hum it :)
<Alchemist> CrimsonPhoenix: okay I can agree with that, but I think that increase in chance is trivial.
<Storm_Chaser> Hello Everypony
<Ninjazz> Om, that... is a good idea. :_
<Ninjazz> :)
<[B]JRP2234> Phase4: what have i done: http://youtu.be/uewKXpDxFGk
<OtakuTom> Hi Storm_Chaser
<CrimsonPhoenix> I could compromise on that
<Irish_Pony> Ninjazz: can ya tell Bunny_Maid_Luna i wub her for me? :$
<IowaBrony> Hey, StormChaser.
<Ninjazz> Irish_Pony, if I see her, she'll get the message. :)
<Irish_Pony> Ninjazz: thx lad
<lakingsfans> "My buddy Keith tried camping out on top of a building once. He was shooting crows, but the police were too busy teargassin' him to ask what he was doin' up there. He screamed for an entire year every single time he opened his eyes! Oh, man! At first, it was funny; then it just got sad, but then it got funny again! Oh, man!""Man, I love malls. I do. Once, I was in this mall, up in Atlanta, and these guys were dancing
<Ninjazz> Irish_Pony, you're... welcome. :$
<lakingsfans> i learned all that from the game :3
<Shamroc> lakingsfans...elis..you thing now is the best time?

<Glacymr> hi
<Glacymr> what's up
*Storm_Chaser hugs IowaBrony and OtakuTom, giggling
<lakingsfans> "I ever tell you about the time my buddy Keith drowned in the Tunnel of Love? You wouldn't think it could happen 'cause the water's so shallow, but that's how it gets you, man. Overconfidence. Keith was with his lady at the time, and he was yellin' for her to save him, but she didn't want to get wet."
<MadSurge> YAY :D
<Bunny_Maid_Luna> My computer is crazy 6_9
<Alchemist> CrimsonPhoenix: I tortured myself by watching several atheist vs theist debates last night and what I concluded was no matter how good points/reason one can come up with, the other side wont agree/convert, that how powerful a mindset can be.
<cow224> dawwww
<Ninjazz> Bunny_Maid_Luna, just tell it that everything is going to be just fine.
<Shamroc> cow224...you gonna 1v1 phase?
<MadSurge> HOW DO I TRUMPET
<CrimsonPhoenix> conver obviously not but compromising possibly
<lakingsfans> what is with twilights eyes?
<IowaBrony> I am so confused right now..
<MahBoi777> come back to this awesome Lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> then again if we're talking about relgions then yeah there's nothing we can do
<Shamroc> Phase4: show the new one...
<CrimsonPhoenix> but to respect the other views
<cow224> Shamroc: yes but he has to get some stuff under check real quick just give him sone time
<Shamroc> cow224.. i know i was just asking
<Om> Suddenly, beard
<MahBoi777> O Pinkeh XD
<lakingsfans> "I ever tell you about the time my buddy Keith fell out the rollercoaster? Yeah, he didn't drop far, mind you, just onto the tracks, but the carnival people wouldn't stop the ride 'cause all the other people paid good money and Keith snuck on for free, so he had to dodge for, like, 20 minutes or so."
<Ninjazz> BY PINKIE'S BEARD!
<MahBoi777> :D
<cow224> Shamroc: oh i didnt mean to sound like a jerk or nothing sorry man

<Bunny_Maid_Luna> mario_pony: When Stewie kills Louis :)
<OtakuTom> Same here, Ninjazz. I haven't found Family Guy funny in a very long time. All I see is a writing team that can't think of anything, so they reuse old jokes way too much and make some jokes go on for way too long.
<mario_pony> :O me too
<Ninjazz> Panda, we can't have nice things for long.
<Panda> NO PYRO IS AS GOOD AS Shizuschlafen :)

<Evil_Spike> Night Moopy
<lakingsfans> i always wondered what that pony on the desktop is looking at on his moniter
<xxMoopyxx> *Moopy has left the chat*
*Ninjazz counted 13 seconds before he actually left
*Shimmer gently pats Ninjazz
<Lil_B> and i was still to late to say bye
*Meanwhile didn't care for that guy.
<Spell-of-Gaming> http://gif-database.tumblr.com/post/25296718189
<Shimmer> Meanwhile: That is not the pony way, shame on you
*Ninjazz is gently patted :3
<WallDives> Meanwhile, he was originally a troll. what did you expect?
<MadSurge> :D I love Phase4's OC flipping rockets
<Meanwhile> Shimmer: you mean "love and tolerate" ?
<Phase4> 00,02:3
<Shimmer> Ofc
<lakingsfans> that rocket doesn't look safe
<Spell-of-Gaming> http://gif-database.tumblr.com/post/25299975262

<Ninjazz> Hey there, Invi! :)
*Invi hugs Ninjazz :)
<lakingsfans> what time is it?
<MadSurge> Ohai Meanwhile, Invi and Lil_B!
<Meanwhile> There's nothing to discuss, Love and Tolerate is ponychan muppetry. Not to mention a bad idea.
*Ninjazz hugs back Invi
<Invi> hi MadSurge ^^
<Meanwhile> Allo MadSurge.
<Mutterguy> it's fine. So long as Phase4 remembers to deploy the parachute and they don't land in hilly terrain they'll live
*Lil_B hugs MadSurge

<Meanwhile> Inb4 Phase4 forgets to do that.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: Lollipop Chainsaw is great :D
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Um...ok?
<Lil_B> MadSurge do you like "the voice"?
<WallDives> hi MadSurge.
<MadSurge> WallDives! :)
<Om> WallDives: The wall!
<twilight_sprinkle> oh? did he succesfullu land on Mun?
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Tara had so much fun recording her lines :D
<lakingsfans> shoot that rocket!!
<WallDives> MadSurge, you can have Lollipop Chainsaw, I'm getting Pokemon Conquest later today.
<Invi> hi Lil_B ^^
<Lil_B> hi there Invi ^^
<MadSurge> WallDives: only tried Pokemon Black :D
<Lil_B> brb filling up my water bottle
*WallDives has nearly every pokemon game...
<Meanwhile> When I played Pokemon it was Gold.
<Meanwhile> http://www.reactionface.info/sites/default/files/images/1310671996285.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> so was there a moon landing>
<twilight_sprinkle> ?*
<lakingsfans> you spin me right round
<Shimmer> Pokemon black/white would be my only reason to get a DS. Luck has it, it's also the reason I don't get one. Ugliest pokemon designs ever
<OtakuTom> I have all the main series pokemon games (blue, red, yellow, gold, silver, crystal, etc)
<lakingsfans> what the hell was that Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> lakingsfans: that was incredibly smug Sulu.
<WallDives> Shimmer, only the ugliest ones since RBY. Since they ARE Monsters.
<lakingsfans> lol
<Shimmer> OtakuTom: And there's no reason to get the rest
<Phase4> 00,02well shit
<Lil_B> i only have blue and red, because I'm retro XD
<lakingsfans> your screwed
<Mutterguy> fuck
<Invi> Lil_B not even gold/silver? :O
<WallDives> At any rate, I liked Nobunaga's Ambition when I was little, so i'm getting POkemon Conquest.
<Lil_B> Invi no
<Invi> poof
<lakingsfans> fail
<Invi> ded
<Lil_B> all that work...
<Invi> what are these buildings there?
<Meanwhile> http://derpy.me/LctJ-
<OtakuTom> I already have Black/White 2 preordered.
<lakingsfans> not a single fuck was givin that day
<WallDives> OtakuTom, /)
<Mutterguy> hey! I gave one!
<Meanwhile> Who'd you give it to?
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont even have b&w 1
<lakingsfans> ok one fuck was givin that day
<Lil_B> make a X-Wing!
<WallDives> also, Lil_B, I'm doing a Pokemon Stadium run atm.
<Lil_B> WallDives Staduim for the N64?
<WallDives> yessir.
<Invi> Yeah make a X-wing :)
<Lil_B> I have that game :D
<WallDives> with Transfer Pak.
<Shimmer> Stadium isn't for anything other than N64
<Invi> Shimmer i got it for PC on emulator :D
<WallDives> it was on the N64DD, but we DONT talk about that.
<Mutterguy> I gave it in honor of the crew's family. Along with my bill as their lawyer
<lakingsfans> interesting
<Shimmer> Invi: Emulators don't count :)
<lakingsfans> we are ready for liftoff
<Meanwhile> Inb4 it explodes.
<lakingsfans> engines?
<Shimmer> I expected seeing a original 151 pokemon MMO this year at E3
<Shimmer> But it never came :(
<lakingsfans> watch it blow up
<Spell-of-Gaming> Massive Multiplayer Online about Pokemon
<Spell-of-Gaming> GAAAAAAA NO QUESTION MARK KEY KJSAK:JD
<lakingsfans> fail liftoff
<Invi> needs more speed
<Mutterguy> wooo! Lift off!
<diddutz> that was a close start
<WallDives> Shimmer, TPC doesnt want a MMO.
<lakingsfans> pull up
<Meanwhile> Shimmer: If you expect to see something you want at E3, you're gonna have a bad time.
<WallDives> so, you will NEVER see it.
<lakingsfans> what the hell
<Panda> night night everypony :) HAVE A GOOD NIGHT~
<Lil_B> behold! The N64 Tower! http://i71.photobucket.com/albums/i135/sweaterfish/NinTower.jpg
<Meanwhile> Night Panda.
<twilight_sprinkle> didnt explode
<lakingsfans> what kind of flying was that?
<Shimmer> Meanwhile: True dat
<Meanwhile> Man I hate E3.
<WallDives> Lil_B, *bows*
<lakingsfans> interesting flight Phase4
<Panda> Lil_B: nintentower :)
<Panda> well im out :)
<Meanwhile> lakingsfans: That wasn't flying, that was falling. With style.
<Shimmer> Meanwhile: After all, all I wanted to see was a pokemon MMO and some info about FF vs XIII
<Lil_B> WallDives I wish i knew what all these things even wer XD i only know the N64DD and the thing on the top
<Shimmer> Neither came
<Mutterguy> Phase4, the controls are still horrible clearly?
<Lil_B> Bye panda :)
<Phase4> 00,02the real problem is the fuel tanks
<Phase4> 00,02they dont drain evenly
<lakingsfans> lol
<Phase4> 00,02so the craft ends up rear heavy
<twilight_sprinkle> Mutterguy: controls?they arent bad
<Mutterguy> they are in the demo
<WallDives> Lil_B, I know the bottom two are DD variations, the 2nd from top is a Standard 64, the top, I dont know...
<twilight_sprinkle> Mutterguy: idk theyre fine for me
<lakingsfans> Alright everypony i'm going to hit the sack
<lakingsfans> i'm done
<Meanwhile> Night lakingsfans.
<Mutterguy> I could just be shit
<Lil_B> WallDives the top one is a copy station, to make a copys of your games on empty cartridges
<WallDives> ah. and now the riddle is solved.
<twilight_sprinkle> Mutterguy: you do realize its hard to control it cause of air resistance?
<Meanwhile> Boom.
<twilight_sprinkle> aw caterpillar exploded
<Lil_B> well... it DID make an awesome car
<Meanwhile> Shrapnel and giblets everywhere.
<Shimmer> You saying boom in chat adds effect to the screen
<Mutterguy> yeah but there's not a lot of things that I can use to reduce drag
*Lil_B watches Stream, listenes to VGA
<twilight_sprinkle> Mutterguy: well how could you reduce it, its a rocket, not a racing car
<WallDives> mfw I havent opened a page for the stream.
<Meanwhile> Damnit Captain I'm a doctor not a pilot!
<Mutterguy> flat top fuel tanks spring to mind
<twilight_sprinkle> Mutterguy: like canisters? there are fuel tanks like that
<Meanwhile> My chat is deeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaad.
<twilight_sprinkle> ...BOO
*Ninjazz is slapped
<dishwasher_EXTREME> 'ello mates
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi dishwasher_EXTREME
<Meanwhile> Allo dishwasher_EXTREME.
<Ninjazz> Hello there, dishwasher_EXTREME.
<Mutterguy> Well i was thinking about structural elements you put on to of the tanks so they're nice curvy and not going to drag
<DuskShine> Would anypony be interested in reading a creepypasta fic me and a friend are making?
<DuskShine> I need feedback c:
<twilight_sprinkle> Mutterguy: leave it to the specialists bro
<twilight_sprinkle> :D
<Majestic_Sparkler> creepypasta?
<DuskShine> Yup.
<twilight_sprinkle> DO IT AGAIN
<Mutterguy> more bolts Phase4
<Majestic_Sparkler> Whats a creepypasta ?
<twilight_sprinkle> bolts? where we're going, we dont need, bolts. *flips shades*
<DuskShine> Its kind of a spin off scary fic.
<DuskShine> Dark-Grimdark
<Majestic_Sparkler> oh
<DuskShine> Its not going to be like cupcakes though.
<DuskShine> *shiver*
<Phase4> 00,02Mutterguy, more bolts
<Spell-of-Gaming> http://gif-database.tumblr.com/post/25108312552
<twilight_sprinkle> creepypasta is scary lazagna
<DuskShine> I will never be the same again xD
<Mutterguy> I'm suprised duct tape isn't a structural element
<DuskShine> Nor will i look at pinkie the same.
<twilight_sprinkle> lol.
<Lil_B> Mutterguy or spare wooden planks
<Majestic_Sparkler> I cant look at pinkie pie after i read princess molestia... biggest mistake of my life...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Well time to sleep, goodnight everyone
<twilight_sprinkle> bye, oh TheGreatAndPowerfulT !
<Lil_B> bye TheGreatAndPowerfulT

<twilight_sprinkle> creeping chat

<[B]JRP2234> Phase4: nvm
<Spell-of-Gaming> Mutterguy: http://gif-database.tumblr.com/post/24071674701

<Peaches> Who is streaming?
<OtakuTom> Yes, stream is working
<OtakuTom> Phase is streaming
<Lil_B> I higly doubt the funktionality of this Vehicle
<Phase4> 00,02Damn
<Majestic_Sparkler> LOL
<Phase4> 00,02that things rugged
<Majestic_Sparkler> they surived?!
<OtakuTom> Well...they lived, at least :P
<twilight_sprinkle> lol it survived...just as planned
<Lil_B> Lol
<MadSurge> :D at least they didn't die!
<twilight_sprinkle> happy kerbals
<Mutterguy> Tonight on Destroyed in seconds!
<OtakuTom> I need to fix my gaming rig so I can finally start playing this. I bought it a few days ago ^^;
<MadSurge> And then pony Phase4 pops out a rocket :D
<Majestic_Sparkler> what happends if you get it flying?
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Om> I see no way this could possibly go wrong.
<Lil_B> Majestic_Sparkler I din't think we will ever see that :/
<Majestic_Sparkler> ok :o
<OtakuTom> The obvious solution is to add more wings :P
<Om> OtakuTom: OBJECTION! Thrusters is the way to go.
<Mutterguy> Majestic_Sparkler you stick rockets on it and get a contract with NASA
<Majestic_Sparkler> lol
<Lil_B> wow, Lavos Theme+Meridian Dance+One-Winged Angel+Destati...
<FairysHuff> Hi everypony ~_~
<Majestic_Sparkler> hello
<OtakuTom> Hi FairysHuff
<Om> hey FairysHuff
<Lil_B> hi FairysHuff
<FairysHuff> Thanks ^_^ Coming on here makes me feel better
<Lil_B> i correct myself... a One winged Angel+Kefka Theme
<OtakuTom> Dancing Mad is best boss song ever, Lil_B
<WallDives> Dancing mad?
<Lil_B> OtakuTom yes, indeed
<Jim> oh, airplanes!
<Om> One Winged Angel is fun on Audiosurf
<twilight_sprinkle> nu, one-inged angel is
<WallDives> hi FairysHuff.
<OtakuTom> FF VI final boss theme
<MadSurge> WallDives: from Final Fantasy 6
<Lil_B> WallDives Final Boss in Final Fantasy 6
<WallDives> I know this.
<Majestic_Sparkler> lOL
<Jim> LIFTOFF!
<MadSurge> UH OH
<WallDives> you said Kefka's theme, thats what I was correcting...
<OtakuTom> So many parachutes
<Majestic_Sparkler> will it survive
*WallDives has the SNES Instruction Manual for FF3/6.
<Majestic_Sparkler> ooooo
<Om> THey live!
<WallDives> and the game too, but whatever.
<MadSurge> AND THEN THEY LIVED :D
<Jim> bang
<Majestic_Sparkler> yay
<Lil_B> WallDives yes, in this Suite they mixed, Kefkas Theme with Dancing Mad and One-Winged Angel
<Om> how have you been FairysHuff?
<Lil_B> and 3 other boss themes XD
<Mutterguy> Phase4 i acn't help but think you need far larger wings
<Majestic_Sparkler> thrusters everywhere
<FairysHuff> I was fine until a moment ago. The tutor I have for a class at the local high School has quit. And she was really nice. ~_~
<Jim> Fire ze missiles!
<FairysHuff> So I'm a tad upset
<Om> Bummer.
<FairysHuff> yeh
<Majestic_Sparkler> barrol role
<WallDives> so sorry to hear that.
<FairysHuff> Thanks.
<OtakuTom> When it comes to boss themes that aren't for final battles, I'm particularly fond of Lords of the 4 Elements from FF IV
<twilight_sprinkle> its goin down too fast
<Phase4> 00,02Mutterguy, but those are the biggest wings
<twilight_sprinkle> oh not anymore
*Ninjazz pats FairysHuff on the back
<MadSurge> It's not workiiiiiing!
<Majestic_Sparkler> and
<Majestic_Sparkler> BOOOM
<FairysHuff> But ah well. I can't let it get to me. It's upsetting but if I let it it will just pull me down. This is life. People move on as sad as that is.
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: that may be the problem, it might add to much torque when turning. im just guessing tho
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Thanks ^_^
<Lil_B> OtakuTom I think my favourite Sub-Boss theme is Natural Killer Cybord from Mother 3
<Ninjazz> Anytime. ^-^
<Lil_B> Cyborg*
<Om> I think the interface for liftoff horizontally is a tad wack.
<OtakuTom> Hmm...I'd probably swap the order of those wings. I think having the ones with the higher lift in front would be better to lift the nose up for takeoff.
<twilight_sprinkle> wow that bent so much
<Jim> ded
<WallDives> FairysHuff, true story...
<Om> *groud poke* BOOOM!
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Mother3 is a nice game, but I really hate the story :(
<twilight_sprinkle> OtakuTom: as long as it doesnt add to much torque inertia
<Lil_B> MadSurge I kinda like it, its so open
<FairysHuff> WallDives: Shame it's not as easy to do as it is to say ^_^ heh
<Om> ...Hi.
<twilight_sprinkle> hey .... Om
<Om> Hmmm, that was pretty easy
<twilight_sprinkle> wait,i added one dot too many
<Lil_B> I like the Fake-Lead-in to One Winged Angel in the actual FF-Suite, Trolls everyone by actually playing the Chocobo Theme
<OtakuTom> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: oh i saw dat :D
<Om> twilight_sprinkle: That is the.Worst.Possible. Thing!
<Majestic_Sparkler> god damit. im not gonna have internet for hours from now on... I hope i can entertain myself. anyways bye bye everypony :)
<Lil_B> hi Om... Oô
<twilight_sprinkle> Om: yep, ive doome dthe world
<WallDives> bye Majestic_Sparkler.
<Om> Lil_B: Hiiii O_O
<OtakuTom> I'm excited...the only official 25th anniversary concert in North America is being held right here in Chicago :)
<Lil_B> damnit, already gone !
<Ninjazz|BRB> Cya maj...
<Ninjazz|BRB> Damn.
<BroKnee> Does anypony wana play any games?
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: maybe you try adding wings with those flippy plates or moving the one you have>
<Lil_B> BroKnee maybe
<FairysHuff> Apparently Jack Ozboure, son of Ozzy Osbourne, has Multiple Scelerosis
<FairysHuff> Poor guy ~_~
<twilight_sprinkle> hm, dancing nice is quite nice. still think one-wingeed angel is better
<twilight_sprinkle> *dancing mad lol
<Om> oh dam
<Jim> badaboom
<Om> I guess going that fast friction really pulls you apart
<twilight_sprinkle> he needs more torque when turning
<Ninjazz|BRB> That was pretty one too.
<twilight_sprinkle> vertical turning i mean
<Jim> Whoa, what's that desktop pony?
<WallDives> Jim, I think thats Phase4's OC.
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle Whats so greate about this song is that it fits so well to the main villain, and the overall final fight.
<twilight_sprinkle> Whos that desktop pony? dundundun!
<Phase4> 00,02tis ma oc
<Om> Who makes all those custion oc desktop ponies?
<WallDives> I was right. ^_^
<Jim> it's so awesome /)^3^(\
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: i never played ff7 or 6. but in ff7:ac and in ff7:cc one-winged angel also fits great :D
<WallDives> twilight_sprinkle, boo, play them.
<OtakuTom> Okay, I've gotta log off for now. I'll try to be on again a little later.
<Om> OtakuTom: Have teh funz
<twilight_sprinkle> WallDives: my psp broke, dont have anyth else to play on :(

<twilight_sprinkle> FairysHuff: eat them?
<Om> twilight_sprinkle: /) for similar ideas
<FairysHuff> twilight_sprinkle: I suggest a SAW style retribution ^_^
<twilight_sprinkle> Om: [\
<twilight_sprinkle> FairysHuff: idk what that is
<twilight_sprinkle> unless it involves sawing politicans in half
<FairysHuff> twilight_sprinkle: Probably just as well. Those movies are disturbing.
<Lil_B> I guess I'll use xCaht as well, hence i want to use Linux in the Future so i could get started with this :)
<twilight_sprinkle> linux...of the future!
<twilight_sprinkle> wow that reference died out fast
<Om> Just like the chat.
<FairysHuff> Om: It was your fault
<Om> That I can live with.
<FairysHuff> heh
<twilight_sprinkle> Om you murderer
*Om stabs the chat
<twilight_sprinkle> dun dun DUUUUUN
<WallDives> Om doesnt usually kill things, but when he does, its the chat.
<FairysHuff> Topic: Needing to poop when someone else is using the shower... for HOURS!
<Om> Solution: You don't get to poop.
<WallDives> ...what.
<FairysHuff> Om: Yup
<twilight_sprinkle> FairysHuff: yeah i kno dat feel, i lived in a dorm with 3 people
<Lil_B> I'm out fo an hour, but remember... I WILL be back Muhahaha >: D
<Om> Lil_B: And you are?
<Om> WallDives: I haz meme prowess
<Lil_B> Om I'm Lil_B :/
<FairysHuff> Lil_B: Your going to deny someone the right to poop aren't you
<Om> Lil_B... Lil_B...No, sure you aint big b?
<Lil_B> FairysHuff I'm currwent5ly olane in this house...
<twilight_sprinkle> dat spelling
<FairysHuff> twilight_sprinkle: And they ALWAYS just start the shower right when you need to go O_o
<Lil_B> Om nope...
<Om> Oh well. Nice to meet you.
<twilight_sprinkle> FairysHuff: yes, it was ALWAYS like that, and one of them is in there for hours
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle sorry you had to see this derp spelling XD
<FairysHuff> Yup
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: dont let it happen again!!!
<Lil_B> anyway, I'm gone XD
<Om> Lil_B: One last thing
<twilight_sprinkle> bai Lil_B
<Lil_B> Om what?
<Om> Shoe size
<FairysHuff> I say we lead a revolution of seperate toilet and bothroom rooms ^_^
<Om> What is yours.
<Lil_B> ... 42
<FairysHuff> ALL HAIL THE SEPERATE TOILET ROOM!
<Om> Hmm hmm. How many inches is that?
<Lil_B> Om goddamnit! BYE!
<Om> Lil_B: I MUST KNO!
<Om> :(
<FairysHuff> Om: It's uroberos.
<FairysHuff> ^_^
<Lil_B> Om I don't know how much that is...
<Om> Is that like cerebro FairysHuff?
<WallDives> not Uroboros..
<Om> Lil_B: Can you check?
<WallDives> dammit WESKER!
<FairysHuff> WallDives: You maybe right. I'm not sure of the spelling.
<Lil_B> Om if you tell me how exactly do you mesure it XD, i have a ruler that has Inches on one side
<WallDives> FairysHuff, the RE spelling is different from the normal spelling.
<WallDives> which is Oubouros.
<FairysHuff> Om: I don't know what cerebro is unless you mean brain.
<Om> Lil_B: Okay, but you have to use a aluminum ruler.
<FairysHuff> WallDives: Why is there a respelling?
<Om> FairysHuff: Sounds the same.
<WallDives> FairysHuff, because the Japanese are terrible at English spellings, generally.
<Lil_B> Om thxcaoby
<Om> He finally left xD
<WallDives> as Om noted, phonetically, its the same, so no one cares.
<FairysHuff> Om: Wall and call sound the same but are different. You fail at logic ^_^
<WallDives> especially not the Localization staff.
<Mutterguy> 26 and 1/4
<FairysHuff> WallDives: I think your may have confused the meaning. Uroboros is the nevereding snake that eats it's own tail.
<WallDives> It is.
<Om> FairysHuff: Logic is for chumps
<Meanwhile> Ouroboros
<twilight_sprinkle> i love des tutorials http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=007VM8NZxkI&feature=related
<WallDives> the Resident Evil Virus is named after that concept.
<Spell-of-Gaming> If I had a dollar everytime Hatsune Miku made me depressed, I would afford the White House
<FairysHuff> Meanwhile: Normally I would look it up but I'm too damn lazy today ^_^
<Ninjazz|BRB> Assuming you can even buy it.
<Om> Which you cant.
<Spell-of-Gaming> With corruption, of course
<Spell-of-Gaming> And also the help of Discord :P
<Mutterguy> you might be able to buy Downing Street though
<Meanwhile> Ouroborus or Uroborus.
<twilight_sprinkle> ive been to the white house, its surprisingly small
<FairysHuff> Mutterguy: Afraid thats already been bought by the banks.
<Spell-of-Gaming> No stream, right :P
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, some would call it cozy. :3
<Om> Yes.
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: eh, too white
<Om> twilight_sprinkle: Raceist.
<Ninjazz> I lol'd.
<twilight_sprinkle> nou Om
<Spell-of-Gaming> As much as awarding as a White House would be, I'm afraid of ghosts
<twilight_sprinkle> Om: and you misspelled racist
<Mutterguy> No I mean literally tearing up the Houses by their foundations and carting them of to say Dorking or Weston Supermare
<Mutterguy> *off
<Om> twilight_sprinkle: You misspelled Raceist.
<FairysHuff> OH OH OH!! Theres a new season of Yuri Yuri coming ^_^ YAY! I love that anime.
<Mutterguy> but not Basingstoke (ewwww)
<twilight_sprinkle> Om: Touché
<Spell-of-Gaming> I need to watch and play Little Busters next time
*Om cant do a fancy e :'(

<FairysHuff> Om: hehehe ^_^

<Ascendant> Especially with the new format
<Mutterguy> MadSurge that's for when you reach Mungor, the ice moon
<Ascendant> it's all put onto one line
<Om> twilight_sprinkle: You would know >.>
<FairysHuff> opiates are in the arm rest

<Ascendant> just need to search for <div class='storytext xcontrast_txt' id='storytext'> and then end at the next </div> after that
<Ascendant> and then write a HTML parser
<twilight_sprinkle> Om: ive built an entire evil base with a freezer with body bags so i would
<FairysHuff> So no one wants a FREE copy of Magicka on steam then?

<twilight_sprinkle> so much weight
<FairysHuff> Om: Steam or Magicka?
<Ascendant> but no, I think I'll use python for this
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: It's actually really easy once you learn the shield spells.
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff, which I didn't. :D
<diddutz> Phase4: You can rotate your wings with the q w e a s d keys
<Om> FairysHuff: Uhhhhh
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Just combine shield, ice or earth and cast on yourself
*Ninjazz writes that down
<diddutz> that way you can atacht those fins to the delta wings perfectly
<Ninjazz> Got it.
*Phase4 00,02hugs diddutz

*diddutz is hugged
<Om> I have no idea =___=
*Skylands sleeps on Ascendant
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: I like to combine shield + ice + earth and use a life staff.
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: The more of an element you use the more powerful it becomes
<Ninjazz> I like it when goblins go boom. :3c

<Ninjazz> So if I use more of fire on a simple... beam spell it will be more powerful?
<FairysHuff> Om: Well if you have steam add me on it and we'll know for sure. Same ID as here as on steam.
<twilight_sprinkle> not for long at least
<Jim> I prefer to use the elements of harmony
<Skylands> 10Waking up at 6am ;-;

<ofna01> it would have cake
<ofna01> lots of cake
<Phase4> 00,02if i shifted the fuel into the center of the engines
<Phase4> 00,02and used the cooling engine bodys instead of the ramjet ones
<Phase4> 00,02this would work better
<ofna01> uhh
<Jim> seems reasonable
<trollhunter> I have no idea what your talking about
<Jim> /) Science (\

<ofna01> YES THATS A CHALLLENGE!
<Lil_B> this really looks like a Train XD
*diddutz is now building an B-2 in kerbal space program
<Phase4> 00,02Invi, k
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<ofna01> if you can build a B-2 on there and get it to fly,i will say you are a genius
<Invi> :D
<HiImSpike> Phase4: Make a helicopter with jet made perpellas ifs that how you spell it
<ofna01> weirdest
<ofna01> landing gear
<ofna01> ever
<ofna01> of all time
<trollhunter> its like a bug or something
<ofna01> needs wings Phase
<HiImSpike> ofna01: specially made from Phase4
<twilight_sprinkle> wow lol
<ofna01> who needs wings
<ofna01> amiright
<OtakuTom> Best spacecar ever!
<HiImSpike> rollerblade not FTW
<Phase4> 00,02:D
<twilight_sprinkle> its the schoolbus of the future
<OtakuTom> lol
<trollhunter> someone need to put that thing out of its missery
<Phase4> 00,02i think i can make pod racers
<Lil_B> as i sead, good Train XD
<ofna01> CHOO CHOO BITCH
<ofna01> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> chugga chugga woo woo
<Lil_B> hover-craft?
<ofna01> dat gea
<Jim> Excellent!
<Vordox> Pony Phase thinks Phase is ridiculous now XD
<Jim> This shit should be on Top Gear
<trollhunter> crazy train
<ofna01> Phase defys physics daily
<Om> This game is gunna get crazy
<ofna01> needs wings phase
<ofna01> and an elevator
<Om> Space? Nah, we haz pod racerz
<Invi> Om it is not gona get. it is already :D
<OtakuTom> That fin will be too tall
<ofna01> not gonna fly
<HiImSpike> screw gravity :[
<Mutterguy> with a lot of squinting I could almost see an AT-AT
<ofna01> No
<ofna01> just No
<Jim> That's not going to fly
<Jim> Wait a minute
<OtakuTom> Wow...I'm surprised.
<ofna01> FULL POWER PHASE
<Invi> Mutterguy what? where?
<Jim> is that a boat?
<ofna01> FULL POWER
<Lil_B> This game knows more about Physics, than Half Life 2
<Invi> wait, it it using the landing gear as wings? xD
<ofna01> FULL POWER PHASE!
<ofna01> FULL
<Meanwhile> Looks like a troop transport from Supcom2.
<Ninjazz> And that is saying something.
<ofna01> POWER
<Mutterguy> well if he keeps retracting the wheels it's walking
<ofna01> YEAH!
<ofna01> No!
<Lil_B> Number of people who got the reference=Zero :D
<twilight_sprinkle> not really, half life 2 is great, but this is a simulator, hl isnt
<Jim> OH, I get it, it's a torpedo
<twilight_sprinkle> so a simulator is supposed to have heavy physics base
<ofna01> TORPEDO AWAY!
<Jim> Deployable from land
<ofna01> full throttle phase!
<ofna01> we must find atlantis!
<HiImSpike> man the things you can do with rocket fuel
<Phase4> 00,02DAMNIT
<Phase4> 00,02the engine disapeared
<Kandarihu> Well, looks like this rocket is made for land travel
<Mutterguy> a Kamikaze land torpedo
<HiImSpike> boom
<ofna01> icwututriedtodothere
<Kandarihu> How about making a car?
<ofna01> no
<OtakuTom> tipping over XD
<Jim> It's rolling over :D
<ofna01> we need moar space planes
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: add it on the top 10, maybe then it wont
<ofna01> or just planes
<twilight_sprinkle> *top
<Om> Do a berrel roll!
<Jim> Like a dead guppy
<twilight_sprinkle> wow why the hell did i write 10, im scared
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle there is a Nerdcore Song by MC Hawkins and MC Frontalot with the Lyrics "I know more about Physics, than Half Life 2!" thats what I was refering too
<ofna01> its a space shuttle
<ofna01> yay
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: well i was mostly asnswering to Ninjazz :P
<Lil_B> or an U-Boat
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I'll be bach~
<ofna01> :P
<Lil_B> oh XD sorry, I did't catch that twilight_sprinkle
<trollhunter> got to get to sleep now bye all
<ofna01> night troll
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<Mutterguy> yesh. Sleepy times for me too
<Ninjazz> Cya trollhunter. Take care.
<Ninjazz> Cya Mutterguy. Take care.
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Mutterguy and trollhunter
<Lil_B> Scoot-Scootaloo will be bach in just a Minuet
<Invi> I need the ful version of that game :D
<Mutterguy> bye all!
<Lil_B> bye Mutterguy
<twilight_sprinkle> take Ninjazz , cya care
<HiImSpike> bye Mutterguy
<Ninjazz> Waaah? D:
<Kandarihu> Phase4: not sure if you've seen the latest xkcd, but I've come to realize that he's waging an all-out war on the English Language, now.
<Ninjazz> Oh you, twilight_sprinkle. :3
<Jim> cya trollhunter and Mutterguy
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, with reason
<Lil_B> brb, taking a shower
<Mutterguy> Kandarihu it's totally 3
<OtakuTom> "a couple" is ALWAYS 2
<Kandarihu> Darn right
<Jim> So when I say "I'll only have a couple of drinks"
<twilight_sprinkle> add wheels until it reaches the moon
<Jim> ^
<HiImSpike> put two small wings and see if it will take off Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02it wont take off
<Phase4> 00,02way too heavy
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Dont stoppppp believin!
<ofna01> moar engines
<ofna01> that will make it take off
<twilight_sprinkle> its like a skate boot with rockets
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Lol oh god
<twilight_sprinkle> suddenly no wheels
<OtakuTom> XD
<Jim> Disengage
<ofna01> lol
<HiImSpike> owwww
<twilight_sprinkle> splat
<ofna01> the guy in the middle
<ofna01> lol
<HiImSpike> back to the drawing board
<OtakuTom> I think you need some secondary wheels for when the fuel compartments come off XD
<Invi> Phase4 make as many thrusters as possible with as many fuel tanks as possible and look what happens xP
<Jim> The guys in the middle gives no fucks
<HiImSpike> stop
<ofna01> engine gone
<twilight_sprinkle> add the engine to the top
<ofna01> shuttle does not want to be a boat
<ofna01> yes!
<ofna01> engine on top!
<Kandarihu> After looking through the backlog, maybe "all-out war on the English language" might be premature.
<HiImSpike> y u not be boat
<ofna01> how to boat
<ofna01> take shuttle
<ofna01> put engines
<ofna01> ???
<ofna01> PROFIT
<twilight_sprinkle> how to motorboat
<ofna01> oh god
<twilight_sprinkle> :P
<ofna01> Wrek!
<HiImSpike> ofna01: lovin <3 the idea
<ofna01> stop kickn meh
<twilight_sprinkle> ofna01: its a bot
<CCCP> hi ofna01
<ofna01> mr commie!
*twilight_sprinkle nomz CCCP first
*CCCP hugggles ofna01
<CCCP> :o
<Jim> hai CCCP
*ofna01 hugs CCCP
<HiImSpike> Phase4: you should make the tallest space mobile ever
*CCCP nomz twilight_sprinkle back
<CCCP> hello Jim
<twilight_sprinkle> ow my back
<CCCP> lol
<Om> I smell the blood of a CCCP
*ofna01 makes chips & Salse
<ofna01> Salsa*
<CCCP> Om: O_O
<ofna01> anyone want some?
<Invi> hi CCCP ^^
<Jim> Sure, I have the munchies when depressed
<HiImSpike> ofna01: have we ever made salsa in space... IDEA :D
<twilight_sprinkle> well that was...
<ofna01> whats wrong Jim?
<CCCP> hi Invi :)
<Jim> Exam tomorrow
<ofna01> oh
<Jim> Really nervous
<twilight_sprinkle> Jim: which exam
<Jim> Maths
<ofna01> its alright,exams are Easy
<twilight_sprinkle> ofna01: lolwut
<ofna01> just concentrate and you'll do fine
<HiImSpike> needs MOAR wheels
<Meanwhile> If all else fails, coat it in breadcrumbs.
<ofna01> HAHAHA
<Phase4> 00,02this is not working
<twilight_sprinkle> ofna01: apparently youve never taken college exams
<OtakuTom> When all else fails: C4
<ofna01> GOD DAMNIT PHASE
<Invi> :D
<Phase4> 00,02one more try
<ofna01> made me spit cola all over my screen!
<Meanwhile> It isn't? you mean the idea wasn't to hilariously explode?
<twilight_sprinkle> Jim: which maths
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, its not unwelcome, just not the goal
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: add the engine to the top if you want a boat
<ofna01> IM ON A BOAT
<Meanwhile> Hmm.
<ofna01> Full throttle
<Meanwhile> You need wheels.
<Meanwhile> You need wheels on your wheels.
<ofna01> phase,i have an idea
<Meanwhile> You need wheels, on your eyeballs!
<ofna01> lol
<Videofreak1127> hello
<twilight_sprinkle> yo dawg i herd you liek wheels
<CCCP> lol
<ofna01> *rides around on eyeballs*
<ofna01> hellyea.jpg
<Phase4> 00,02THATS IT
<Phase4> 00,02i'm bolting the front to everything else
<Jim> Not sure what you call it over there, but we use geometric series, trigonometric equations, non-linear regression and differential equations to name some
<Meanwhile> Lmfao.
<ofna01> HHAHAAHA
<Om> That isn't supposed to happen
<HiImSpike> no offense but if this was in reality i would be '3'(\
<Meanwhile> A slight nudge, and there goes the cockpit.
<ofna01> Phase,stop your killing me
<Jim> We just call it R2
<Meanwhile> Oh wow. That was spectacular.
<ofna01> i nearly choked on a chip
<ofna01> oh god
<Om> ofna01: Try harder.
<Meanwhile> Your chip needs wheels.
<ofna01> *puts wheels on chip
<Videofreak1127> What game is this?
<twilight_sprinkle> Jim: sounds easy, but weird that differential equations doesnt fit in that list
*ofna01 puts wheels on salsa
<ofna01> Kerbal Space Program Video
<Videofreak1127> ok
<ofna01> free demo available at the site
<Om> chps x wheels. Make it happen
<Jim> We also have integration, so it kinda fits
<ofna01> Phase has the right idea
<ofna01> MOAR ENGINES
<Videofreak1127> This reminds me of spore
<ofna01> spore,but with rockets
<ofna01> likeaboss.jpg
<Meanwhile> More apples!
<ofna01> you cant eat all those apples
<twilight_sprinkle> Jim: oh geometric series, i read that wrong. yeah so im guessing youre in college. i had my last calc exam a bit over a week ago
<ofna01> MOAR SPEED
<Meanwhile> That wasn't right.
<ofna01> LOL
<Meanwhile> But it WAS hilarious.
<HiImSpike> directed and made the game by himself I give you Micheal bay and his game of exploding space ships!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> its like a drunk turtle
<ofna01> Michael Bay made this game
<Meanwhile> lol, twilight_sprinkle.
<ofna01> I HAVE AN IDEA
<CountDoofus> Hi, everybrony
<Jim> hi CountDoofus
<Meanwhile> Allo CountDoofus.
<ofna01> EVERYONE PUT MIND HEIST ON
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi CountDoofus
<HiImSpike> hello CountDoofus
<twilight_sprinkle> ofna01: YASSIR
<Meanwhile> And then it falls in half or something.
<Meanwhile> Or a giant falcon picks it up.
<Sylandest> morning, everypony! :) *yawns* How are we all today?
<Jim> hai Sylandest
<Meanwhile> It trips on a pebble.
<Roflercopter> hes making a space bus?
*Ninjazz attacks Sylandest with hugs
<Meanwhile> Allo Sylandest.
<ofna01> this fits perfect!
<HiImSpike> slow and steedy explodes the race
<Om> lololol
<Ninjazz> Hello there, CountDoofus.
<Meanwhile> Fail.
<Jim> Still going!
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cXLYxx1yBA
<Invi> lol
<ofna01> everyone listen to that while watching
*Sylandest hugs Jim, Ninjazz, Meanwhile, Om, Invi
<Jim> It's like a droid, picking up the cockpit
<ofna01> it fits
<Meanwhile> It looks like it's carrying an ice cream cone.
<ofna01> MY ICE CREAM
<ofna01> lol
<ofna01> nom icecream
<Om> Sylandest: You're awake!
<CountDoofus> Ocean. Ocean. Ocean! OCEAN!
<Meanwhile> Dat wombo combo kick
<Jim> ofna01: It made it 50% cooler
<Meanwhile> I must go, the...sea, needs me.
<HiImSpike> johnny dont press the button... Ow crap
<Sylandest> Om: eeyup! A few hours unconscious, and im back in action
<ofna01> WTF?
<Meanwhile> Dat spin.
<ofna01> No
<Om> Sylandest: Oh jes
<ofna01> we need a real plane!
<Videofreak1127> Right after that crash, my desktop Pinkie Pie said, "I never felt joy like that before!"
<Videofreak1127> XD
<ofna01> HA
<Invi> yeah it obviously needs more landing gears
<Sylandest> moar gears!
<Meanwhile> Wheels...on wheels.
<Roflercopter> WOW A SPACE BUS
<HiImSpike> this is eqivelent to game over... but to the little guys lifes over
<Om> Sylandest: There are no gears?
<ofna01> LOL
<ofna01> MOAR GEAR
<Sylandest> Om: er...I meant wheels...XD
<ofna01> MOVE THIS GEAR UP
<CountDoofus> Everyone knows it needs more railings.
<Videofreak1127> I'm drawing a blank as to what I should name my OC
<Videofreak1127> it sucks
<ofna01> no Count
<Jim> Deploying wheel railings, riiight here
<Om> Sylandest: Have something special in your cherious this mornin?
<ofna01> it needs more engines
<ofna01> MOAR ENGINES
<Jim> Cross it!
<Jim> Do eet!
<Sylandest> Om: :O how did you know I was eating cheerios?
<HiImSpike> yes
<HiImSpike> do it
<twilight_sprinkle> dont cross the wheels!
<Meanwhile> So let me get this straight.
*ofna01 crosses the streams
<Meanwhile> Wheels didn't work.
<ofna01> >:D
<Om> Sylandest: Don't look out your window O_O
<Meanwhile> So you think wheels on stilts might?
<ofna01> haha
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: problem?
<Jim> Cross the streams because that always ends well
<Sylandest> Om: *looks out window* oh. my. god
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: Not really. This is going to be funny as hell to watch one way or the other.
*Om waves
*ofna01 gives everyone chips and salsa!
<twilight_sprinkle> hmm, these wheels Might be enough
<ofna01> EL QUESO!
*Sylandest waves back at Om, slightly terrified
<HiImSpike> this must be the cheapest airlines to man
<Ascendant> woohoo
<Ascendant> It downloads and checks if the story exists now
<FairysHuff> *YAWN* Sooo tired. ~_~ Damn you day light.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: the logic is flawless, wheels well fix everything
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh lol
<HiImSpike> :O
<ofna01> lol
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: perhaps you need sleep? :$
<Om> FairysHuff: I sleep during the day all the time :I
<Sylandest> oh shiz
<Phase4> 00,02whered my plane go
<Jim> I don't always eat cereal, but when I do: http://derpy.me/dZQa1
<ofna01> HA
<ofna01> HAHA
<twilight_sprinkle> weird, whyd that happen
<Jim> EXCELLENT
<CountDoofus> :D
<Sylandest> Phase4: its here, and there, over there, and there
<Meanwhile> Your plane blew up so hard not even shrapnel was left.
<Jim> it just went bang
<Meanwhile> It was atomised.
<twilight_sprinkle> damn it, get our scientists back in here, we have another mystery
<ofna01> i cant
<ofna01> stop
<ofna01> laughing
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: I sleep very poorly so I end up tired and sleeping all the time. Constantly toss and turn. Never fully asleep.
<Meanwhile> Lmfao
<HiImSpike> boom
<Jim> Nopony survived http://i.imgur.com/Kvr3p.png
<HiImSpike> FTW
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: oooh, that bites. I'm sorry to hear that
<Meanwhile> Jim: rofl
<FairysHuff> Om: Sadly as do I. I only ever feel awake at night.
<Sylandest> twilight_sprinkle: perhaps we crossed too many wheels? :D
<ofna01> he crossed the streams
<twilight_sprinkle> Sylandest: naaaah
<Om> FairysHuff: I only feel awake when I am awake :D
<HiImSpike> FairysHuff: sucks to read that
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: I wouldn't mind so much if I atleast had a little energy to do stuff.
<Sylandest> twilight_sprinkle: moar wheels then!
<Jim> So, crossing the streams is apparently a bad thing
<twilight_sprinkle> Sylandest: on it!
<Ascendant> ffndl.py:24: SyntaxWarning: name 'directory' is assigned to before global declaration
<ofna01> well,i have to take shots daily
<Ascendant> but rage
<ofna01> poor me
<Ascendant> that's annoying
*twilight_sprinkle shoots ofna01
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: well, do you eat or drink anything right before bed?
*ofna01 catches bullet
<Meanwhile> In case of catastrophic failure of spacecraft resulting in the deaths of pilots, find new pilots and give the spacecraft stilts.
<FairysHuff> HiImSpike: Meh. Been like this since I was a child. Just the way my body works unfortunately.
<ofna01> ....
<twilight_sprinkle> ofna01: hey, you didnt take your shot.
<ofna01> needle shots
<Videofreak1127> Pinkie's twitchin'
<Videofreak1127> She knows what's gonna happen
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Rarely and even then only toast and water.
*ofna01 throws bullet back at lightspeed
<CountDoofus> KABOOM
<Sylandest> awwww
*twilight_sprinkle shoots a needle at ofna01
<Jim> BLAWIE
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: hmm...perhaps its your mattress?
<Meanwhile> It's only got legs on one side.
<ofna01> browser ponys is best ponys
<Ascendant> well 'night
<Meanwhile> How did you overlook that? :D
<ofna01> other then desktop ponys
<Jim> It happens to him ALL the time, Meanwhile
<Jim> He forgot to have a second wing earlier
<HiImSpike> FairysHuff: do you have a condition with sleep may I ask
<twilight_sprinkle> LOL
<Sylandest> roflmao
<Jim> loool
<Meanwhile> Lmfao
<Sylandest> Phase4: I just don't know what went wrong! :D
<Phase4> 00,02why did that happen
<CountDoofus> Cockpit-blocked.
<twilight_sprinkle> lol its moving
<HiImSpike> yeah yeah yeah boom boom boom
<Meanwhile> Because the lord of physics hates your stitls.
<Meanwhile> stilts*
<FairysHuff> HiImSpike: I have no idea. I've been to the doctor numerous times and they don't think it's anything to worry about.
<twilight_sprinkle> i hnate stitlts too
<Jim> I'm amazing at stilts
<FairysHuff> *BIIIIIIIIIIIG Yawn* Oh fook... >_<
<Vordox> wtf is that....
<Meanwhile> Derp.
<HiImSpike> in soviet russia plane controls u
<Sylandest> Phase4: I am of the persuasion your rocket has a few bolts loose...XD
<Jim> This spacecraft reminds me of those spiders
<Meanwhile> Why don't you add oars as well?
<ofna01> i have ponys on my screen
<FairysHuff> I was going to by lavendar oil and an oil burner. Apparently it helps with sleep. But the shipping cost for an oil burner is stupidly high.
<Phase4> 00,02i cant figure why it sfalling abart
<Om> Spider plane?
<FairysHuff> *buy
<Sylandest> Om: eeeyup
<Invi> hmm needs more thrusters and landing gears
<Meanwhile> Om: fund it.
<ofna01> spider plane. spider plane. does whatever a spider plane does. can it swing from a web. no it cant, its a plane.
<Meanwhile> Phase4: You're sure it's not held on with PVA glue?
<somepony_else> FairysHuff: just put some drops of lavendar oil on a wet cloth and hang it somewhere near your bed
<Jim> Make them wings!
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Jim> GENIOUS
<Kandarihu> Wheel Wings!
<Sylandest> nope
<ofna01> needs moar wings
<Meanwhile> Rofl
<twilight_sprinkle> aw
<Jim> dafuq happened?!
<Meanwhile> Just the sound of explosion
<ofna01> i heard big boom
<Om> Well there's your problem
<FairysHuff> somepony_else: How would that work? O_o
<Meanwhile> But they lived!
<Sylandest> and the pilots just do not give a buck! :D
<ofna01> rest of the plane is gone
<Phase4> 00,02k
<Phase4> 00,02new plane
<Kandarihu> It started suspended off theground. Then it fell
<Meanwhile> Just put an engine on the back and see if it flies.
<ofna01> phase's orginal design
<ofna01> the flying torpedo
<ofna01> AKA the Torpedo
<somepony_else> FairysHuff: evaporation. if you use a wet cloth, the water evaporates. but it also spreads the scent of the oil
<Videofreak1127> brb
<ofna01> need an engine and some wings
<ofna01> then it is space worthy
<somepony_else> that's what i do with mint oil, when i've got a cold
<ofna01> mint oil?
<ofna01> :O
<HiImSpike> lovin the design
<HiImSpike> <3<3<3
<ofna01> looks like a fighter jet
<ofna01> <3
<FairysHuff> somepony_else: Hmm I hadn't thought of that. Though that would only work during the summer. It wouldn't evaporate at any other time during the year. I live in Scotland. Very cold.
<ofna01> i see what he's doing
<Lil_B> I'm back, but i don't know when the first guests will arrive, than I will have to leave for a couple of hours

<Meanwhile> Make one less likely to die!
<Sylandest> welcome back, Lil_B!
<ofna01> the X-Wing flew,im pretty sure the Y-Wing will too
<Lil_B> hi Sylandest ;)
<Kandarihu> ofna01: it did?
<ofna01> Yeah!
<ofna01> it flew great!
<Jim> This will crash and burn

<FairysHuff> Saturn: I fear you and your potential flatulance. ^_^

<Kammerjunk> I have a dream that one day, the mares and stallions of this world will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all ponies are created equal.
<Sylandest> oh my lord its working
<Sylandest> ITs working!
<HiImSpike> Kammerjunk: nice dream
<Jim> LOL
<MegaMoonShine> NAHT!

<Kammerjunk> I don't know, it gets kind of annoying after a while.
<FairysHuff> Just a quick reminder for any Scottish bronies. I'm still interested in setting up a bi-weekly D&D game. ^_^ Let me know if your interested.
<Jim> It just collapsed upon itself
<ofna01> i was in a different tab
<Sylandest> Om: Who else but me though? :D

<Jim> hi Irish_Pony
<FairysHuff> Jim: Can never to too careful. ^_^ People may get the wrong idea.
<Meanwhile> FairysHuff: As if one might confuse the word weekly with the word sexual.
<ofna01> F-14 should be easy to make

<Meanwhile> RainBowJack: Well I might, but Idk what your steam is actually doing.
<Lil_B> RainBowJack whats wrong with your steam?
<Sumica> 00,10I never uploaded them
<RaveBrony> Alister: Lol!! I showed him that :D apparently hes already talked to that guy :P
<BrOnyxia> Sumica: ;o wait wut. u made them? how?
<Alister> RaveBrony: How did it end ?
<RaveBrony> I found it while looking up how to make your own OC desktop pony...
<Sumica> 00,10I used GIMP
<Vordox> Someone's talking about Sprites?
<BrOnyxia> Sumica: gonna try someday xD.. thx tho
<Sumica> 00,10desktop ponies is easly modded
<RaveBrony> Alister: Lol, not sure :D he chatted with him a while back apparently :P
<ofna01> LOL
<Alister> RaveBrony: I wished I was there to see it
<Sumica> 00,10but the best I can do is a bit of copypasta and recolors
<RainBowJack> Lil_B : when i start up a game like TF2 just 5min and it turns my screen black and my sound bucks up and then i need to restart my PC
<Sumica> 00,10you need some one good to get like what Phase4 has.
<Barbetos|AtWork> NUUUUU
<MegaMoonShine> Whoa!
<Barbetos|AtWork> =((
<rdibp> esplode
<Barbetos|AtWork> asplode even
<BrOnyxia> Sumica: he made it right?
<RaveBrony> Theres a tutorial on how to do it...but you need Photoshop :'(
<Barbetos|AtWork> wut?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Why did that explode?
<Meanwhile> Dead.
<Lil_B> RainBowJack oh, I had problems with Steam too a few days ago, but different ones, sorry i can't help
<Meanwhile> Reasons,
<BrOnyxia> kia
<diddutz> Phase4: I think your merged engines are making everything acting wired. I got a simmilar problem with cockpits falling apart because i had an engine in a wing.
<Jim> photoshop, why you so expensive
<Vordox> RaveBrony: You don't need Photoshop
<Phase4> 00,02diddutz, its something else
<Vordox> RaveBrony: GIMP is good enough
<RainBowJack> Lil_B what did you do about it?
<Meanwhile> RainBowJack: That sounds more like a problem with your graphics than steam, are your drivers updated?
<BrOnyxia> Jim: its why cracks exist :D
<RaveBrony> Vordox: Does it have the same features as the tutorial on desktopponies?
<RainBowJack> its sinds the last update that steam does that so you can be
<Awesomeness> listening to balloon party
<Awesomeness> XD
<Lil_B> RainBowJack my problem was entirely different from yours, so it wont help you. Steam didn't want to connect to the internet, and i fixed it by turning of my Proxy-Server in IE
<Sumica> 00,10are you tryng to add lift boosters?
<Crono_brony> i prefer onlive... no worries about graphics cards.
<Sumica> 00,10turn off snap to angles
<RaveBrony> I dont know how to work art programs.... let alone, animations.... so without a tutorial on how to make ponies.... Id be completely lost
<Vordox> RaveBrony: GIMP has all you need to make anythig sprite related
<Sumica> 00,10or that
<Vordox> RaveBrony: Animation? Just do a sprite sheet
<BrOnyxia> ima go now... gotta love biology exam
<BrOnyxia> :S
<MadSurge> They should call this game "Michael Bay simulator" :D
<RaveBrony> Vordox: See? I have no clue what that is :D
<Vordox> Give a "field" of how much you want your sprite to be in size, usually make sure it's 55+ x55+
<Sumica> 00,10oh god arrow jets?
<Vordox> Phase4: Building a harrier
<Sumica> 00,10no good will come of that
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<rdibp> see you all later
<Lil_B> Vordox, can you teach me how to use gimp someday? Every time I look at it I have 0-clue what to do, everything I try messes something up
<Vordox> RaveBrony: BASICALLY, make a sprite sheet...Let me show you ONE of the things I did
<Barbetos|AtWork> Bye rdibp
<Vordox> I don't use GIMP, I use PSP
<MegaMoonShine> Bye rdibp

<Sumica> 00,10just took down the seagebreaker with friend last night on eu

<Meanwhile> Why not stilts?
<Sylandest1> Om: go for it, hehe. Good sleep helps to keep one happy and going
<Jim> Stilts are best wheels
<Vordox> RaveBrony: It's not as hard as you think it is
<kidzrul434> I had food for breakfast!
<Phase4> 00,02cause i didnt think of them
<Phase4> 00,02they might work better
<Vordox> RaveBrony: Just do like...pose to pose...
<Om> Ninjazz: Fair enough. In case I fall asleep and you leave, goodnight xD

<Ninjazz> Om, and to you too, good sir! :D
<Vordox> Then do inbetweens to make it smooth

<Big_Macintosh_1992> <--- this is fun to watch. what is it?
<Vordox> Phase4 should not fly a spacecraft...
<Meanwhile> Agreed.,
<RainBowJack> that was a EPIC fail moment Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02^ Vordox
<Sumica> 00,10you could try detaching the vtol
<VenHur96> Agreed, bro.
<Meanwhile> Or you could try more wheels.
<Vordox> Phase4: It's kinda quiet, got any playlist? =3
<Lil_B> Vordox nor should he design one XD
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, that assumes i'm not tired
<ofna01> im back
<ofna01> MORE WHEELS!
<Phase4> 00,02and thinking straight
<Vordox> Lil_B: Designin is fine
<Alchemist> RaveBrony: it would be but the ppt I have to study from only have a few bulletpoints and dont explain anything. Its quite hard to learn what quantum entrapment/confinement means all by yourself...
<MadSurge> *losing horns*
<ofna01> i keep thinking the engines startin up are sirens
<ofna01> lol
<Meanwhile> Toasty.
<Vordox> LOL
<VenHur96> Toasty!
<Vordox> They looked happy before the explosion
<ofna01> haha
<RainBowJack> poor Phase4 OC his Roket gets blown up everytime
<Lil_B> the Jury sais 8/10 for the Backflip
<RaveBrony> Alchemist: Oh dang :\
<Meanwhile> Vordox: "Finally! Our suffering is over!"

<RaveBrony> Alchemist: yeah, thats tough :\
<brony_swan> hey bros, what r we watchin
<RainBowJack> diddutz : indeed
<Lil_B> I think the Kerbals dumped more money into their Space Program than NASA
<ofna01> Lil
<Sumica> 00,10the space program is all they have
<ofna01> i think they spent 99% of that on Beer
<Big_Macintosh_1992> <---- This guy's spending billions and billions of government dollars trying to get this thing to fly.
<Sumica> 00,10not the lack of citys
<Sumica> 00,10note*
<Jim> so, Kerbals just want to get away from their planet
<ofna01> DAMN
<Jim> Because it's a dump
<ofna01> Phase4: fly the G-14
<RaveBrony> :O
<Phase4> 00,02good idea
<Lil_B> Sumica their Civilisation is all underground... I guess because they are all gangsters
<Jim> Fly the G3.6
<Jim> Lil_B: Or hipsters
<Meanwhile> Jim: Well, look at it. Judging by this game the only thing on the planet is a rocket design and launching station.
<Meanwhile> AHAHAHAHA
<Big_Macintosh_1992> ha
<ofna01> Phase4: i hope you fixed the G-14
<ofna01> HAHAa

<Lil_B> Lasers deflected succesfully
<RainBowJack> Phase4 : i think they need a Barf bag

<ofna01> G-14
<Sumica> 00,10then make it an f14 g from swatcats and add a third nozzle
