<Serenity> Lets say that if this coat was any thicker, I'd die of a sunstroke during the 2010 snowstorm at -15'c
<Jerry> Hey JappleAck

<TheMaster> pff, chrome. Don't trust google
<Meanwhile> Hello everyone.

<TheMaster> nazis make everything better
<Serenity> JappleAck: I had a printer, but no camera
<Jerry> Nazis make everything 88% Cooler

<JappleAck> Was the infrared on the Gameboy Color ever used?

<Serenity> JappleAck: I think it was used in pokkymans
<Jake> JappleAck: i never used it
<Serenity> But it failed hard because Infrared
<Serenity> Wish I still had my gameboy pockets

<String_Shredder> OohShiny: Use finkleboob
<Kammerjunk> Plastic surgery is the old-fashioned way?
<artist> and sometimes you are bitch? is it possibru to say that?
<RAWRity> Saturn: not really. This is a special case because the show he was dubbing was awful, but other shows he's done? They were at least competent, and he intentionally made the dubs shitty.
<Kammerjunk> Call me old-fashioned, but I think that fire is magic. And it scares me a lot.
<OohShiny> damn it time skips
<MadSurge> NYC_Brony|Bored: Ghost Stories. Horrible anime but the western dub saved it :D
<Eli> ouch
<RAWRity> Saturn: and now not only is he working on "Grave of the Fireflies", he's doing "Mawaru Penguindrum" as well which is...no. just no.

<Kammerjunk> artist: Call me old-fashioned, but it seems to me that when the giant that hold up the Earth falls, we are SCREWED.
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: i kinda like it......but this is hilarious, i gotta say :D
<OohShiny> those gems remind me of ace attorney

<Franek12354> twilight_sprinkle: Close enough :)
<MrBen> alexxm: Doing alright. For the most part.
<pony_300> magmablock: I think the wind went out of the sails when 2000 came. Now nobody gives a fuck about prophesized dates.
<BroPony|MEDIC> the 2012 theory doesnt predict the end of the world, it predicts a drastic change
<Conyst> We were going to run out of bacon by 2012.

<Tamazarashi> yes you are
<Polydunami> Hey Michael
<IshPonyThePonyPony> we're all dead men
<AlienWarhead> The end of the Mayan calender does not mean end of the world, it means get a new calender
<Thugging_Centipede> The Mayan calendar doesn't say the world is going to end, it's just when the calendar ends
<ThePillowship> MrBen, because they want to :3
<Ghosties> 04He's really, really missing a boombox, dammit
<BroPony|MEDIC> celestial alighnment my ass
<Ghosties> 04Where's his boombox
<DuckManCuack> Im a dead man.... Wait 4 hours
<Kandarihu> Tovler, the only thing holding Obama back is that he wants to be re-elected. If he gets over that hurdle, he'll get away with anything he wants, and it doesn't matter what anyone else says.
<pony_2812> skipple shure piedram orpreder
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> hi Polydunami
<BoulderDash> Two months till we're all dead men
<AlienWarhead> lol Thugging_Centipede
<XxNightHawk64xX> wait is it true that nasa says there wil be a solar flare by christmas time cause i heard that
<Pale_Horse> You know. I'm willing to bet what the ancient Mayans actually knew about "Mutating meutrinos" could fit into the Grand Canyon and still leave room for the rest of the entire Universe... :|

<XxNightHawk64xX> do scientists in real life actually saying that something will happen around christmas time

<Ghosties> 04Hah
<Celestia`s_Bunny> Megalomanic: you`ll GET weak after 4 days of not going to sleo
<Tassadork> alexxm: that is the real question
<Kandarihu> The idea here is that the Mayan Calander's 5th age runs out on December 21st 2012, and this is somehow fortelling the end of the world.
<Ghosties> 04That's me and my nephew and niece, basically
<IshPonyThePonyPony> why are there subtitles for this?
<AVS619> limo is best vehicle
<fluttercry> 05,15Personally I can't wait until December 21st 2012. It's going to be awesome
<OohShiny> who needs kids when you've got the internet!
<Ghosties> 04We should show 2012 that night
<Meanwhile> Who knows.
<Cypresswolf> I like listening to the arguements of bitchy divorced couples in movies -_-
<fluttercry> 05,15Everyone's going to be freaking out and NOOOOTHING is going to happen
<Pale_Horse> I live in New York. I remember when we got a 6.5 quake about 15-16 years ago and everyone thought that was a really big deal.
<Tamazarashi> oh no not that guy, I live that guy but he dies. :(
<Sciaenops> What's funny is that Mayans themselves have no idea where the apocalypse thing is coming from.
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: Exactly! :D
<BroPony|MEDIC> fluttercry: Ikr, I did the same thing on May 26th
<Mutterguy> yeah! 4 days before Christmas!
<pony_1707> what if the spanish comquered them before they could finish it
<Polydunami> I'd be willing to play the air raid siren on that day.
<AlienWarhead> fluttercry: And maybe a new pony episode
<Ghosties> 04So at least in one plane of existence, it DOES happen
<ThePillowship> I can't think of a way to draw a noseless pony at all.
<IshPonyThePonyPony> why are we watching with subtitles?
<Michael> Gnight everypony! HF

<fluttercry> 05,15AJIsAwesome nothing happened, but everyone thought that all our computers wouldn't be able to handle the millenium change
<Ghosties> 04Independence Day was pretty terrible too
<Sumica> 00,10it's not a proper disaster movie with out a ship
<Meanwhile> Probably because a good amount of it isn't in English.

<Kandarihu> fluttercry, the Y2K bug was a serious problem when it was discovered. It took some work to fix the bug, and almost everyone was unaffected.
<Pale_Horse> It's not stellar, but since it's on sale I'd say it's worth it.

<Kandarihu> fluttercry, if we had done nothing to prepare for it, there would've been a lot more disaster than a video rental in NYC charging people with 100 years of late fees.
<Everlasting_Joy> And than Yellowstone will erupt.
<Meanwhile> Yellowstone's gonna go up like a supernova.

<Polydunami> Millennium, nothing, fluttercry; most computers only had the last two digits of the year programmed. It wouldn't have mattered if it was 1900, the craze would still be there if computers existed back then as they did twelve years ago.
<Barbetos|Blashemer> oni_link I don't own it and I agree
<pony_300> I can't remember if the children in this movie are abominable or just annoying

<OohShiny> I'll just ask another question. Why does this movie even exist? If everybody knows how the movie end, what's the fun?
<Conyst> machine guns best shovel
<AVS619> digging with machine guns. seems legit
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: Nope.
<J_E_Smith71> ...wait it's only be 30 minutes of course it hasn't
<Lil_B> than why are qwe starting twith the B Movie?

<Ghosties> 04This is the second movie I've seen where John is a writer
<Chrysalis> Also, Digging with bullets

<Ryunosuke> uhh
<Ghosties> 04Iced coffee is the bomb
<Ryunosuke> that wouldnt be a solar flare
<magmablock> Mayans didn't predict shit, they just didn't feel like writing down their calender to the year 5 billion
<Kandarihu> What? THAT didn't get subbed?
<OohShiny> Bane: Scare people? I think that's a horror movie you are talking about
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: can the neutrinos microwave my soup?

<pony_2812> what-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t
<Big_macinsocks> This is the B movie, it is being shown forst because of the graphicness of the A movie IIRC

<Ryunosuke> secondly, a solar flare would not cause magma displacement
<OJ> Does temperature rise with velocity?
<Thugging_Centipede> I'M LAUGHING AT THE STUPIDITY OF THIS MOVIE
<Bane> Save valve

<Eli> For a movie about a catastrophe of cataclysmic proportions, it has way too much humor...
<Chrysalis> BoulderDash: no fire
<Tassadork> it is actually kind of enjoyable how reidiculous it is
<oni_link> Navy_Brony: esentially the last level in the first HALO
<GamerGodJones> Thank god this guy is the best driver ever
<abrony> like a boss
<OohShiny> tokyo drift now
<Barbetos|Blashemer> John Cusack only knows how to be cheesy in love!
<AJIsAwesome> MLG DRIFTING.
<Ryunosuke> and a guy is running UNDER a collaplsing bridge
<Kandarihu> 50 minutes into the movie, and we're finally getting to the stuff from the trailers.
<ThePillowship> RosePetal, it hasn't had fire. Pray that it doesn't.

<pony_300> another words it's CGI porn
<AVS619> lol
<BeetieSwelle> Is there any way to lower the stream quality? I'm lagging pretty bad.
<Conyst> Drive through the building

<Crippler> well...at least it will wash all the ashh off
<Ryunosuke> dat irony
<CCCP> all the CGI
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: So....this makes this movie LESS REALISTIC
<Deadlypon3> ...Oh shut the fuck up you old man
<RosePetal1> So Oz is Heaven? Oh no.
<Tassadork> can I get a perfect 100%?
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: /)
<CriticKitten> SYMBOLISM
<Bane> navy backstabs president
<magmablock> I'm suddenly reminded of Project Horizons
<Tamazarashi> please excuse me while I go sob on my bed :'(
<Dark_Horst> well, at least he gets squished. quicker than drowning
<Shizuka> 13(\
<twilight_sprinkle> he'll walk it off
<Kinixys> That house just got served.
<Tovler> If only we had built more aircraft carriers.
<Nyst> Is this more symbolism?
<Deadlypon3> Shizuka this movie, unrealistic?! NAAAH
<oni_link> Kenedy killed the president lol
<Spazturtle> USS JUDGMENT, oh it had to be that ship
<pony_300> GLOVER NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU, your retirement was today!!
<Ryunosuke> dead president kills current president
<AJIsAwesome> ........
<Sciaenops> Emmerich likes tsunamis, I guess.
<RosePetal1> ded.
<Pale_Horse> Aha! So KENNEDY assassinated the president... :|
<Deadlypon3> Nyst This movie's symbolism is just GUSHING
<IshPonyThePonyPony> .......

*Bronysith snuggles IshPonyThePonyPony onto Lyra` and AJIsAwesome
<pony_300> Pale_Horse: Badam-tish!
<Saturn> 08,01now i really want to riff this film with shizuka
<Dark92Enigma> Pale_Horse: GOD! This is SO EDUCATIONAL!
<CriticKitten> This movie is so full of SYMBOLISM that it's as subtle as a fucking hammer to my temples
<OJ> That's not a making-out car. Try another one.
<Bane> kennedy is reincarnated to a carrier
<Chrysalis> Saturn: that sounds dirty
<Dark92Enigma> Pale_Horse: (sarcasm)
<Nyst> I wanna see the arks. I hope they look high-tech.
*IshPonyThePonyPony wiggles onto AJIsAwesome
<oni_link> lol
<RosePetal1> No.
<Fenr> time to start the repopulation!
<CrazyHippie> people are dying
<Deadlypon3> Nyst Oh you will see them, and they are dumb
<Shizuka> 13tbf by this point the stations able to transmit to the satellites are probably dead
<Kandarihu> There's a Rifftrax of this movie, right?
<Fenr> off to the baby-car!
<Shizuka> 13that and they're over water trying to tune in FM
<RosePetal1> Is this scene important to the story?
<J_E_Smith71> Nyst: Maybe they are Space Colony Arks
*Blaze-Ember 14pets the silence.
*AJIsAwesome prys himself out of the pile
<CCCP> meanwhile everyones dying
<Shizuka> 13just not going to happen
<AlienWarhead> Kandarihu: Most likely
*Meanwhile everyone is dying.
<Deadlypon3> Shizuka Sattilite....car
<RosePetal1> I don't know.
<Shizuka> 13no riff of this yet that i know of, you could check rifftrax.com though
<Adjeca> haha
<Nyst> I'm crossing my fingers for Anno 2070 arks.
<Sumica> 00,10well at least they did't get a signal Shizuka
<Adjeca> hiya
<pony_300> subtlely is this movie's middlename. And that middlename is plastered in 200 foot tall neon sparkling letters.
<Sciaenops> IT'll be like in WALL*E, those big ol ships.
<Ghosties> 04Do you think love can bloom on the battlefield, Snake?
<OJ> Mile-high club
<Celestia`s_Bunny> Nyst: you never seen this before? Holy shit
<Sumica> 00,10would be more silly if they did
<oni_link> lol cereal
<USSR> HA
<Blaze-Ember> 14Hai ouo
*IshPonyThePonyPony grabs AJIsAwesome and forces him back into depths of pile
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm telling you guys, this is why I'm going to get a HAM radio licence. I'm going to be prepared
<Meanwhile> Metal Gear Toasties.
<weeping_pegasi82> SO unrealistic aaauuughh
<Megalomanic> Not one bit!
<abrony> cerial
<Bane> this scene is not important whatsoever
<OohShiny> dat humor
<Deadlypon3> "Do you think we can do this, with you having a husband, and the world ENDING and all"
<Nyst> Nope, never seen this before.
<AJIsAwesome> -_-
<Cades> hey adjeca
<Ghosties> 04MGS
<Lil_B> Ghosties I kinda revise my statement, while this Movie m,ay be the best use of CGI I've seen (it looks good, and destruction in this scale can't be done with other effects), but they expect us too take this story seriously, and thats Bullshit :/
<Ghosties> 04METAL GEAR SHOSTIES
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I guess you can say their reltionship was... Like a bridge over Troubled water!
<XylemTube> I bget tunnel vision everytim e i play sniper\
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: and the only station is three dog
<Adjeca> how's things?
<Welsh_Pony> Got to start repopulating the human race
<Nyst> Also joined halfway though because I had -NO IDEA- that there was a movie today!
<Meanwhile> Pointing out that official room follows official rules. Less /me.
<weeping_pegasi82> it's trying to let you know the characters duh!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03relationship*
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :) what are we watchin'?
<Shizuka> 13Scoot-Scootaloo: and you said my joke was bad
<RosePetal1> Well you could of talked to him about rather than divorce him idiot.
<Ghosties> 04I'm glad you've come around, B~
<Everlasting_Joy> Scoot-Scootaloo: aaaauuugh.
<Deadlypon3> Can't wait for him to die
<USSR> Yay
<Deadlypon3> He is going to die
<Imadolphin> yay
<Kandarihu> Ghosties, only if battle can break out in the Tunnel of Love.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03NO U, shizu >: (
<fluttercry> 05,15Anybody else want to learn HAM radio with me?
<Conyst> hello Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Tovler> Mike Kevin and Bill seemed to have stopped doing riffs of recent hollywood movies
<Celestia`s_Bunny> LOVE TIME NOW!!!
<Blaze-Ember> 14Fine. You?
<Shizuka> 13fluttercry: want to... but broke .-.
<AlienWarhead> Scoot-Scootaloo: man your jokes are washed up
<Blaze-Ember> 14Or was that directed at Cades?
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Sketch_Toku_Brony!
<RosePetal1> Doctor who?
<IshPonyThePonyPony> I'd play this https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/545467_462603910449867_1473194920_n.jpg
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03fluttercry: will there be bacon?
<Meanwhile> fluttercry you're just making me hungry for a sandwich.
<Blaze-Ember> 14.w.
<fluttercry> 05,15Shizuka awww :(
<Ghosties> 04I'm glad they've stopped, actually. I think the older movies are better riffable
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: dats galaxy news radio, ma'm
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Sketch_Toku_Brony. :)
<Adjeca> whomever hehe
<CriticKitten> Wat.
*Lyra` "i agree, Meanwhile, thats why ill do it propper"
<Imadolphin> Cho ming.. Yao ming
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> Quickly we can escape the end of da world with that blue portal! The red one's in Equestria
<Blaze-Ember> 14'kay, haha.
<weeping_pegasi82> so many bad jokes!!
<OJ> We're expecting widespread incontinence
<CriticKitten> .....
*Dark92Enigma hugs Shizuka and Scoot-Scootaloo together
<RosePetal1> Dat tatoo.
<Meanwhile> proper*
<BoulderDash> and the ships leave without them all because everyone hates Americans.
<CriticKitten> That's bullshit. XD
<Sumica> 00,10polls move, still able to navigate
<fluttercry> 05,15It'd be fun because then you get to be "that guy" with a huge antenna in your yard
<AJIsAwesome> IshPonyThePonyPony: :D
<Lyra`> Propppper
<Tassadork> 23 degrees? that would be hundreds of kms...
<Sciaenops> The earth reverses its poles all the time.
<Fenr> southwest......where australia is!I KNEW IT!
<Adjeca> i'm glad it's the weekend :)
<abrony> lol
<Tamazarashi> WISCONSIN lol
<Ryunosuke> lols
<Deadlypon3> DOOOohh
<Shizuka> 13oh and if you're wondering, emmerich has a fixation on wisconsin cause he's from there
<Nyst> It really is Phlox!
<RosePetal1> WUT
<CrazyHippie> seems legit
<Tovler> except most of the riffs on the older movies are bad.
<Blaze-Ember> 14Same. xD I got lucky and didn't have any school today.
<Shizuka> 13and yesh it's phlox
<Deadlypon3> Shizuka I thought he was from the mooooon
<Meanwhile> Close enough.
<Ghosties> 04And the Wisconsin cheese is now somewhere in Portugal
<RosePetal1> OH NO THE SHIP IS FALLING.
<IshPonyThePonyPony> so where did Santa move to then?
<Bane> dont die shasha
<Shizuka> 13he was also in stargate sg1's later seasons
<OJ> And their instruments would now be useless.
<Crippler> WAAAAAAHHHHT
<OohShiny> 15 = 18
<AVS619> lol
<SpeccyRush> Shizuka: slowpoke.jpg
<CriticKitten> Well I always said that Wisconsin was going south with all of those backwards politics, but did they listen? NOOOOOOO....
<Deadlypon3> "DAH"
<turtlegod98> da
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Portugal cheese.
<Deadlypon3> "DAAAHHH"
<Meanwhile> Santa drowned.
<fluttercry> 05,15So he's like Stephen King and Maine?
<Blaze-Ember> 14But I had to go to see my counselor and then to Wal-Mart, instead. >:C
<pony_300> Wisconsin is the south pole now? Now.... I just can't picture it.
<Ghosties> 04Don'tcha want some Portugal cheese, kids?
<Kinixys> Oh.. so the magnetic poles are flipping in this movie?
<SirGanjalf> Oh, so the magnetic poles are changing too?
<IshPonyThePonyPony> so where's the north pole then?
<Shizuka> 13anyway two things, magnetic reversal takes much longer than a day
<Cades> :(
<pony_2812> fuck this family
<Shizuka> 13and two, that would pretty well screw up satellites
<Lil_B> the earth poles have alway shifted exactly 180° (they just shifted places) quite often in history, but it usually didn't led to gttreat desasters
<Adjeca> aye. still better than school i say
<Sumica> 00,10true Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13so there's a tiny bit more realism for that
<OJ> The magnetic poles are flipping us off.
<Meanwhile> Santa drowned by now presumably. Merry Christmas kids.
<Lil_B> great desasters*
<Blaze-Ember> 14Good point.
<Bane> hes better than me
<Sumica> 00,10and it takes a long time to fly from vegas to hawaii
<CCCP> why would he want to save them? It means less food for him
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, there has been some improvements, thanks to Scott Walker.
<weeping_pegasi82> your kinda hoping they're gonna die
<Spazturtle> Shizuka: Magnetic reversal was recently disprovern
<AJIsAwesome> Why would you hate Gordon Freeman?
<Shizuka> 13anyway magnetic poles flip all the time, just on the scale of thousands and thousands of years, not a few hours
<RosePetal1> I don't hate him. I just really really dislike him.
<fluttercry> 05,15"Because he hit me with a crowbar"
<Tassadork> because he's banging my wife
<Ghosties> 04Hasn't the human race yet to experience a polar shift, though? So we're not quite sure how it's going to affect the earth and our race?
<CriticKitten> Nonsense, Shizu. The planet obviously hired Magneto to shift the world's magnetic poles.
<BeetieSwelle> b/c Gordon never gets enough altitude
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: PHYSICS!
<Celestia`s_Bunny> hmmm... I thought at the highest speeds, the poles would take alot longer than a few days
<Bane> because gordon is better than you?
<SirGanjalf> inb4 he sees a Giant Asteroid outside the window
<Conyst> Because he took my crowbar when we were kids.
<pony_2812> i hate earth
<RosePetal1> Suddenly father son moment.
<Shizuka> 13Spazturtle: core samples show clear bands of magnetic alignment in opposite directions that represent many years, we know it's a thing :)
<Dark_Horst> Ghosties: well yeah. actually, ours is late to the party
<CrazyHippie> but he ****
<pony_300> Ihate kids in movies.
<Adjeca> i've always disliked school
<Adjeca> i never went to highschool
<Domo> pony_2812: Don't wanna live on this planet anymore?
<Celestia`s_Bunny> pony_2812: TO EQUISTRIA
<CCCP> oni chan
<Bane> the only good kid was yoko
<DocSane> Um... Is Pan's Labyrinth over already?
<Dark92Enigma> Especially in disaster movies
<RosePetal1> At least the kids are not being annoying now.
<fluttercry> 05,15DocSane no
<weeping_pegasi82> even I knew that
<Sumica> 00,103 down
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: about every 750.000 years, wastn it?
<otakon17> Bane well she is dead sadly
<fluttercry> 05,15We're doing B first tonight
<Blaze-Ember> 14I'm a freshman right now, and hating it.
<Meanwhile> It's gonna be a little bumpy and a little wet.
<Shizuka> 13something like that
<Celestia`s_Bunny> DocSane: NOPE, NEVER STARTED
<CCCP> hi DocSane
<RosePetal1> And Lilly's not a bad person.
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka yeah but maybe the earth going nuts changes it faster? not that i know much about geology
<otakon17> 640k
<Ghosties> 04We haven't started Pan's Labyrinth yet
<Bronysith> i thought santa was shot down over the sea of japan
<Panda> so.... what did I miss? ^^
<AlienWarhead> Docsane no we switched movie times
<DocSane> Why the switch?
<oni_link> Only time where kids arent annoying are kids movies ironicaly
<Katalenic> fluttercry can i ask why?
<otakon17> fluttercry: What is A again?
<NullRadix> All I'm hearing is I need to find a way to squat in antarchtica. So years down the line, when poles shift, my descendents will own the continent
<CCCP> hello Panda!
<CriticKitten> Pan's Labyrinth tonight? Bitchin'. That movie's sweet.
<Cades> I'm a freshman too
<Blaze-Ember> 14But luckily I'm getting moved to an alternate school next week. :)
<Spazturtle> yes becuase engines catch fire when they runout of fuel
<Lil_B> ohai Panda
<fluttercry> 05,15A movie is Pan's Labryinth
<otakon17> Oh sweet
<Panda> CCCP ^^ hello there
<Sumica> 00,10because spiderman.mp4
<Adjeca> aye, yep i went for a little bit that's all
<IshPonyThePonyPony> no, he was killed by terrorists in imaginationland
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: possibly, but the thing is magnetic reversal understandably screws up the magnetic field for a while, which exposes us to the solar winds
<Conyst> Panda!
<Panda> and to you too Lil_B
<Kandarihu> As far as I'm concerned, Pan's Labyrinth is the main event.
<CriticKitten> Bit late to tell daddy that, sweetie
<Celestia`s_Bunny> Panda: lucky you, most of thismovie
<otakon17> And I'll make it most likely
<Blaze-Ember> 14It's internet-based. ouo
<RosePetal1> You have a lifejacket you will be okay.
<AlienWarhead> DocSane: I think it is because 2012 is longer
<RosePetal1> Change of plans.
<SpeccyRush> Sumica: might wanna show that just after
<Tassadork> Spazturtle: the lack of fuel can even cause the plane to explode!
<Shizuka> 13forget the earth destabilizing under you, the sun will fry your butt if the poles reversed
<Adjeca> still graduated by self teaching :)
<Cades> Oh that's interesting?
<Panda> Conyst O_o and Celestia`s_Bunny... uh.. why are you a bunny?
<Blaze-Ember> 14My reaction: "oh HELL yeah"
<Ghosties> 04So when the polar shift happen, will Santa be living in the South Pole from then on?
<Ryunosuke> except here IS china
<Adjeca> internet based.. ? o.o
<mylilpwny> family vacation to china cut short
<AVS619> how long is this movie?
<oni_link> Not a good swimmer, time to learn MOFOS~
<pony_300> YAY
<RosePetal1> Pinkie promise.
<Bane> quit whining
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Ghosties: ah man i always wanted to see Pan's Labryinth,never saw it :D is David Bowie in it?!
<OohShiny> pinkie promies
<Shizuka> 13no we're not kid, the camera keeps focusing on us
<Dark92Enigma> GAME OVER MAN! GAME OVER
<CCCP> why doesn't he just eat them and then use them as blubber for the winter?
<fluttercry> 05,15Santa Clause lives in Lapland

<Blaze-Ember> 14And then I go to a school in the afternoon and work there.
<SpeccyRush> we're gonna die, yay
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: maybe, but hey, at least youd get a wicked tan~
<CrazyHippie> they went from the US to china in 1 day?
<OohShiny> CCCP: like that other movie?
<Ghosties> 04No no, you're thinking of the Labyrinth, Sketch
<J_E_Smith71> Ghosties: Why the switch? Was it because Flutterguy's voice was in this movie and you wanted to play Bridle Gossip afterwards so it'd be more fitting?
<HotWingsSmitesAsses> last world problems
<Meanwhile> Awkward Gordon.
<weeping_pegasi82> cross my heart and hope to fly stick a cupcake in my eye!

<fluttercry> 05,15"Life isn't fair!?"
<XylemTube> what a dick head
<Blaze-Ember> 14Not really. Luckily I have a pretty high metabolism, it would seem.
<CriticKitten> Yes, we get it movie, he's a wanker
<Celestia`s_Bunny> This looks Halo-ish
<BoulderDash> They die... right?
<Meanwhile> Shizu: Yeah true, pardon my terminology.
<Zephyr> Dickish, but realistic
<Big_macinsocks> The yare all gooign to die o nthose ships from Lead paint poisoning
<RosePetal1> Noah's Ark.
<Sumica> 00,10money = ticket to pay for construction
<Meanwhile> For funsies?
<Pale_Horse> He's a wanker but he IS right.
<Fenr> let me take a wild guess...the huge superplanned arks will fail
<OohShiny> Mass Effect takes place right after
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Silent Hill siren :D
<DocSane> Um, like 6 billion people are dying today. Hell, yeah, life isn't fair.
<OJ> We'll see who's laughing when you can't find anyone to jailbreak your iPod
<AJIsAwesome> *shrugs*
<Ryunosuke> they ded
<Nyst> Well, the least you can do is poison the workers. Give them a painless death.
<turtlegod98> oh god
<Ghosties> 04Suddenly we cut to a Transformers movie in India
<Saturn> 08,01he's not a wanker, he's a realist
<Tamazarashi> its the end of the world , and they STILL only care about money.
<Adjeca> ah that's cool. same here, i can't ever seem to gain weight no matter how much/what i eat
<diddutz> and then life happened
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: by the way, sorry for the major curse, but i was angry at that B.S. twist that only delayed the movie, and ran out of things to say
<JimmyRussell> Just came back from a halloween party. I was NoFace from Spirited Away
<Shizuka> 13welp, india wanted a public swimming pool
<Sciaenops> This....this is hard to watch...

<AJIsAwesome> JimmyRussell: Nice!
<Ghosties> 04With Shia Lebouf trying to play off being lost in India
<RosePetal1> IT'S A TRAP!
<Conyst> They are now in the otherworld
<Tassadork> probably more about size than weight ...
<CriticKitten> And besides, the realist angle isn't realist in this movie.
<Meanwhile> Could've, but there's no luxury in that.
<otakon17> Hey a mile high tidal wave
<RosePetal1> But it would be crowded.
<Shizuka> 13suddenly cell reception
<otakon17> Yay
<Sumica> 00,10phone still works

<Shizuka> 13in a town with no electricity
<Tassadork> err, switch taht
<USSR> Cell Service? Nope...
<Blaze-Ember> 14I've been gaining weight, but that's probably good because I was rather underweight for a while, that time because of a medicine that made me lose my appetite.
<Ghosties> 04"I'm just casually talking to you while I'm about to die"
<Dark92Enigma> Ghosties: he makes Matthew Broderick look NATURAL
<Sumica> 00,10must be sat phone

<AlienWarhead> hi brony2447
<Derpy_Hooves> Ghosties: i like this movie :3 (speaking the truth)
<Everlasting_Joy> brain anyone ? damage Anyone getting else
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, brony2447. :)
<Conyst> hello brony2447
<CCCP> The worst part of this movie is that the money could of gone to a charity or somthing
<Randomnerd> lol
<DocSane> Remember, all this happens in a month or so, kids.
<Bronysith> fluttercry: you're a wizard?
<AVS619> hi brony2447 :)
<JimmyRussell> hello brony2447
<CriticKitten> For once I'll defend this movie (it won't happen again): Even the realist angle is stupid. There's no way they could reliably create all of this, and even if they could, there's nowhere to go anyways. Humanity is effectively screwed regardless.
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<RosePetal1> I guess.
<turtlegod98> shit
<Shizuka> 13taking bets on the next kill, no cheating if you've seen the movie already
<IshPonyThePonyPony> say your prayers mankind, if you believe that shit
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm a wizard
<CCCP> hi brony2447
<oni_link> Celestia`s_Bunny: Its some peoples odd way of saying American
<OJ> I'll bet you can't tell this is the same guy who did Independance Day, with Washington getting destroyed, and the ominous countdown and the planes taking off just in time and the President doing something noble and the...
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: Yuri.
<CriticKitten> Glasses guy?
<fluttercry> 05,15Awwww
<pony_2812> fake backround
<fluttercry> 05,15But I could have won that
<Pale_Horse> why do I get the feeling they're building up Gordon to be likable so they can kill him dramatically? :S
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: Are you mad at me? ( i won't blame you if you are ) :(
<RosePetal1> I predict Gordon or the blonde might die. Guessing.
<brony2447> i got some MLP TF2 mods and i am stoked to start using them
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some say the end is near. Some say we'll see Armageddon soon. I certainly hope we will. I sure could use a vacation from this bulls*** 3-ring circus sideshow.
<Derpy_Hooves> Shizuka: im not betting then, i love this molvie, seen it 6 times already
<Meanwhile> Shizu: Five bits on Gordon.
<Celestia`s_Bunny> oni_link: it sounds dumb:/
<Ghosties> 04Nice Derpy
<Silver_Spoon> I got 20 on Gordon
<BeetieSwelle> I want to bet Gordon, he never gets enough altitude.
<Ghosties> 04And I say Gordon dies
<Bane> aang help them
<Sumica> 00,10till the earth and water and fire nations teamed up
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> CCCP what do ya mean about the charity thing? did they cause paranoia just for the movie?
<RosePetal1> They are Americans.
<Dark92Enigma> Meanwhile in Area 63
<Randomnerd> I don't. IshPonyThePonyPony, but I don't blame someone for trying.
<J_E_Smith71> It's more like 2 hours and 38 minutes
<oni_link> Celestia`s_Bunny: yeah i think thats the ooint :|
<potato_pony> Shizuka: I bet that blond chick on the pickup truck is next

<RosePetal1> Cuz they are children!
<Megalomanic> I can't stand them anymore!
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: you there? :(
<CCCP> Sketch_Toku_Brony i mean the money for this movie could of been used for somthing "better"

<Lyra`> SaxyPretender, or you could just not say anything, and it'll be awkward around her, and that will evolve into her thinking you dont like her, and that will become her not liking you, and then you have no chance at all :D
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> hai Ponies47
<Conyst> She just wears a cloak.

<Conyst> I promise not to eat all the Cakes stock.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> How about i go eat some hay? I can make thing outta CLAY,I can lay by the BAY,I JUST MAY! What do ya say? :D happy gilmore

<Lyra`> also, id like to bring this meeting to order. the first item on the agenda is: 1. Fuck Meanwhile
<Imadolphin> Zecora is a girl or boy? :S
<Kandarihu> Imadolphin, girl
<abrony> girl
<AlienWarhead> Imadolphin: girl
<Rev> fluttercry, only the second half, and you can disable the scenes where you fuck them.

<OohShiny> the poison jokes have some funny FX
<Pale_Horse> Oh, here comes the magic snobbery again... >_>

<Lyra`> you almost did, that time your will was broken ;3
<Shizuka> 13>nightmare moon
<Shizuka> 13watt
<OJ> I agree with Rainbow Dash. The distinction seems quite arbitrary.
<twilight_sprinkle> giga
<Ryunosuke> Shizuka, ikr
<naturesfury> OohShiny was thinking that too
<Saturn> 08,01so curses are just Headology
<Blaze-Ember> 14spaced
<fluttercry> 05,15Shizuka you know nobody in this show remembers lessons
<Lyra`> im like a vulture of wayward men
<SpeccyRush> fluttercry: its funny, there will probably still be people in chat that didn't catch your mention of a certain VA
<Imadolphin> Poor Chicken :'(
<OohShiny> damn, crazy dream
<fluttercry> 05,15They all hit their head and get Amnesia
<Shizuka> 13we need an episode next season that does a proper callback
<Dashie_Dashie> My nights in general.
<Dashie_Dashie> lovely dreams.
<Meanwhile> Reality is it only makes it better if I can make you angry.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Chicken Arise,Arise chicken ARISE :D
<Saturn> 08,01wow, even her laughing rhymes
<Conyst> Nicze mane Twi
<Metronome> Animation error
<AlienWarhead> This would be way funnier if Shining Armor got the poison joke
<Imadolphin> HAHA
<Conyst> Nice*
<OohShiny> I like her bed mane
*Lyra` is considering getting a tattoo of a red hourglass
<turtlegod98> lol
<Rev> Sumica, you were the one that used to play Amnesia on stream, right?
<abrony> woble woble
<Pale_Horse> Dear Princess Celestia... I didn't learn anything!... No... Seriously. I didn't... :(
<weeping_pegasi82> no one said she couldn't use magic!
<SpeccyRush> Shizuka: super cider squeezy 6000s lesson is a callback, not direct but it is
<Imadolphin> THE BUCK LEVITATE DAT BRUSH
<AlienWarhead> Dashie_Dashie: full of ponies?
<Shizuka> 13the continuity in this show wants to be more consistent but at times it approaches dexter's lab levels of discontinuity
<Dashie_Dashie> Adorkable. <3
<twilight_sprinkle> wat, no horn jokes?
<naturesfury> not enought viagra?
<Meanwhile> Red sand or actually red?
<Everlasting_Joy> AlienWarhead: Singing Armor, all he could do is speak in song?
<AJIsAwesome> You're usuing your horn right now. :D
<twilight_sprinkle> o there it is
<Lyra`> red sand~
<Ryunosuke> or magic?
<Dashie_Dashie> AlienWarhead, I've been having alot of pony dreams lately.
<Dashie_Dashie> @_@
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back again............And 2012 ended, but i will play my take on it later

<EspyLacopa|2> A purse!
<Lyra`> with marble stoppers
<Rev> Dashie_Dashie, you took the blue acid then.
<Shizuka> 13she ate some of those paper dots
<Everlasting_Joy> AlienWarhead: Oh.
<OJ> I asked for the news, not the weather
<fluttercry> 05,15The discontinuity actually makes me upset. Seeing as the whole point is that they're supposed to learn lessons
<weeping_pegasi82> and maybe she wasn't using magic the whole episode because you don't know what would happen!
<Dashie_Dashie> Rev: I just write to much fics.
<AlienWarhead> Dashie_Dashie: I've had a couple of them
<Dashie_Dashie> :p
<Kimori> Thats not a bad deal at all
<OohShiny> RD, why do you even try?
<Ryunosuke> supernatural could refer to magic as it is not magic, and coming from Twilight, the element of MAGIC, that is kinda... hypocritical dont you think?
<Imadolphin> Headshot!
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: LIKE the time Dexter said he hates Burritos, and in the next, he eats a BIG ONE
<fluttercry> 05,15which the immediately ignore the very next episode
