<MahBoi777> so much detail
<Phase4> i'm not sure i belive that hostname
<UnFoundBug> didnt this game have a quick-save key?
<derpy_pony> everytime a conservative uses the word "internet" here, the pirate opposition wins percents
<Dken2021|FF1> Lawrence who makes sewers that massive?
<Altair> xD
<Altair> Very funny Phase4...
<TopHat> I don't take no shit from the government, man
<Luna> 07,01what about ponysquare?
<MahBoi777> maybe sewers really are dat huge
<Lawrence> This game makes less sense than the physics in speed racer
<MahBoi777> no, the physics in GTA 4
<Nyria> Oh hey there Luna~
<MahBoi777> lol
*Luna hugs everypony

<otakon> what did he do?
<UnFoundBug> "The Plutonia Experiment"
<TopHat> lol
<Wrek> 05its plutonia
<CK|Asleep> Oh, ACTA, that's why the politics. You mean that trade agreement that everyone's already signed? It's pretty much a done deal in the US at least, unless Congress can legitimately argue that it's a treaty and thus requires their ratification. :/
<Lawrence> Twilight is best pony
<EspyLacopa> Now, imagine if you took the difficulty level of the Kaizo Super Mario Brothers, and transplated it into Doom 2.
<Wrek> 05OFICCIAL follow to doom 2
<KetaminaDianePie> hmmmm
<LunaTheBeloved> What that pony said^
<TopHat> :)
<ben1994> who is playing?
<derpy_pony> yes, it was actual in europe 2 or so years ago

<TopHat> I feel like the same thing is said in here everyday

<UnFoundBug> OMG, he has 32 health now
<ben1994> ught im worse at typeing german than english
<EspyLacopa> Whoa. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igIXFyxFTm0&

*TOY_PON3 sighs a bit
<derpy_pony> mean...yourself
<derpy_pony> means
<MahBoi777> epic pie time
<ben1994> hmm das stimmt
<MahBoi777> I have been tempted into making a cherrychunga now
<SkilledSkillet> Das ist kein Deutsch-Chat
<karmathewolfie> :[
<ben1994> enshudigung mener deutch ich bin im deutch dri i can nich spreche gut :/
<UnFoundBug> You mean a chimicherry?
<fluttercry> 05,15how would one create a cherrychunga though
<Cypresswolf> I got a confirmation about an order of glasses. would ya'll like to see the etching design?
<EspyLacopa> With cherries.
<TopHat> with cherries and changa
<ben1994> ich shlaift in der classe ein :0
<derpy_pony> erm...ok, ben1994
<Wrek> 05fuck yeha

<Wrek> 05megashpere
<UnFoundBug> NICE!
<Phase4> crushed cherries in a tortilla isnt it?
<TopHat> and it is spelled 'changa' I checked
<ekips> out of nowhere, megasphere
<UnFoundBug> gz wrek
<MahBoi777> well, according to pinkie, mash up some cherries roll it up in a tortilla, deep fry it and TAH DAH
<Morty> yay best pony room is alive
<Shizuka> 13now go blow it on a squishy ceiling! X3
<Phase4> ^
<Phase4> what MahBoi777 said
<TopHat> barely
<MahBoi777> maaybe some powdered sugar on top
<MrPoniator_laptop> And apparently the people who made some liked it
<MahBoi777> lol
<EspyLacopa> Take a chimichanga, and add cherries?
<MahBoi777> I bet it's good
<Shizuka> 13you really gotta let them infight more :)
<Nyria> I wonder what would that taste like~
<Davie_Jones> I would use something like a puff pastry instead of a tortilla
<Shizuka> 13canary~
<UnFoundBug> so much wasted health and armour
<MrPoniator_laptop> Sounds like a cherry pancake or something
<Cypresswolf> send me a pm if you'd like to see it. I dont want to post it live while Wrek is playing
<Nyria> Hey LadyCanary ^^
<Davie_Jones> Though I don't know how the butter would fare with the deep frier
<karmathewolfie> When did people actualy start chatting?
<LadyCanary> Hiii Shizuka :3 hi everyone. Yaaaay Wreky's playing Doom :D
<Lawrence> 2 minutes ago
<Phase4> ohai LadyCanary
<Nyria> Wreky is playing doom~
<TopHat> you mean in general?
<Davie_Jones> Original Doom?
<fluttercry> 05,15is it just me or are there some graphics mods in this?
<MahBoi777> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YgmJCSQXwg these guys made some
<Dken2021|FF1> hey LadyCanary
<Davie_Jones> Music or Silent version?
<TopHat> or here
<Nyria> Oh I mean Plutonia~ Or something like that~
<UnFoundBug> Doom 2: Plutonia Experiment
<Shizuka> 13wrek is playing the doomsday port of doom 2, with The Plutonia Experiment
<Davie_Jones> Ah
<Davie_Jones> Never played the doom games
<Nyria> Davie jones locker~ Arrg~
<Davie_Jones> Weird, usually by now I'd have someone saying: "You never played Doom before?"
<Lawrence> and then the chat died
<TopHat> those explosions look out of place
<Davie_Jones> And no, it's supposed to be a conbonation of 'Davie Crocket' and 'Indiana Jones'
<UnFoundBug> Unforunately its getting more common
<UnFoundBug> unfortunately*
<Nyria> Well I haven't played doom soo~
<RAWRity> just saw a hilarious comment on YT on a K-Pop song.
<Davie_Jones> It's hard to make myself go back to 2.5D
<UnFoundBug> Get ALL of the ammo
<ben1994> oooh webons cashe FTW!
<TopHat> it looks like minecraft without being intentionally bad
<RAWRity> "Great Dictator does not approve of your catchy beats and sassy dance moves."
<Davie_Jones> And the bad reviews of Doom 3 put me off as well
<Dken2021|FF1> yfw this was someone's childhood
<Davie_Jones> yfw?
<fluttercry> 05,15Doom 3 wasn't that bad. Just, bad design
<UnFoundBug> doom 3 was fun but reviewed under the wrong mindset
<Dken2021|FF1> yfw = your face when
<TopHat> I didn't mean it was bad
<Davie_Jones> Well the main problem most people had was that you can't use a flashlight and a gun at the same time.
*Tovler||Insane is listening to more gothic metal.
<fluttercry> 05,15Duct Tape mod
<Davie_Jones> Aren't you playing a marine?
<UnFoundBug> Kinda ruins the atmosphere hacing both
<ekips> i think i could not play doom, the voices would scare the shit outta me
<SkilledSkillet> Smart Idea fluttercry
<Lawrence> You would they would have run out of monsters by now
<Davie_Jones> It's standard issue to carry a flashlight that attaches to your gun in marine gear.
*ben1994 would die way to quickly if had to play doom irl :/
<fluttercry> 05,15No like, there really was a duct tape mod
<Tovler||Insane> So Doom is streaming right now?
<SkilledSkillet> There was?
<Nyria> Yes Tovler~
<ben1994> haha derpy skeleton woulnt die
<Nyria> And are you insane?~
<Tovler||Insane> I think I've only played like 2 shooters in my life.
<REALmoshakra> moshakra, why did you steal my name...?
<TopHat> I play metroid
<TopHat> thats it
<UnFoundBug> Well done microsoft, visual studio crash
<Tovler||Insane> Oh yeah, I played the Prime trilogy
<Dken2021|FF1> already love it: http://derpy.me/Pyes6
<Dken2021|FF1> I love the prime series
<Tovler||Insane> (where did this cut come from?)
<Davie_Jones> wait, is derpy.me the new tinyurl?
<Dken2021|FF1> it's a form of tinyurl
<Nyria> It's a pony version of the tinyurl ~
<Lawrence> My god http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8sJhUa2qUgg/Tyh3t5D4poI/AAAAAAAAdQg/HjDJ7WyPcko/s1600/trixie_knows_magic_by_doggie999-d4o6s1l.jpg

<karmathewolfie> Here, pretty much. 6_9
<MahBoi777> seems like each DOOM game gets darker
<LadyCanary> I'm liking that new little ticker on the bottom :D
<MahBoi777> might just be me
<Shizuka> 13there's a typo on it though ><
<LadyCanary> Oh well, it's a nice touch ^-^
<Shizuka> 13X3
<MahBoi777> you should try Metal Slug Wrek
<karmathewolfie> Also, I have a random math problem.
<Shizuka> 13rockets in close quarters combat without strafing, seems legit
<SuperBrony64|Silly> 10,02I can solve it

<UnFoundBug> sleep is for those with 9am starts

*TOY_PON3 drinks more cider and thinks deeply
<TOY_PON3> ....
<GarrettBrony> @Wrek omg your on yay:(
<LunaTheBeloved> ^
<KetaminaDianePie> yeeeeah this song
<MahBoi777> cider you say?
*Tovler||Insane eats oats and washes it down with soymilk
<MahBoi777> never tried the stuff
<StickySyrup> I do love cider me
<UnFoundBug> That episode was a little wierd if viewed from uk perspective,
<UnFoundBug> cider is alcoholic in uk
<diddutz_2> i am bulletproof *haha*
<UnFoundBug> apparently not in us
<GarrettBrony> a round of cider for everypony
<MahBoi777> eez good time to run cowards!!
<StickySyrup> UnFoundBug: hell yeah it is
<Shizuka> 13in the US "cider' is pretty much carbonated apple juice
<StickySyrup> thats what made the episode so funny
<GarrettBrony> iddqd
<UnFoundBug> we have a name for that, appleade
<StickySyrup> all ponies looked like alocoholics
<MahBoi777> hm, I've never tried cider
<UnFoundBug> homebrew cider is NICE
<Shizuka> 13pff god mode, it's not like I'M playing this..
<ben1994> CIDER.....Yay
*Shizuka 13is a compulsive god moder
<GarrettBrony> iddqd god mode
<KetaminaDianePie> cider is not alcoholic?
<Queen-Rarity> cider is mostly alcoholic, however the cidder in the episode was made during one day, thus no alcohol
<StickySyrup> I like merrydown cider
<MahBoi777> they sure do like their cider, especially Rainbow
<Davie_Jones> Cider is unfiltered, unfermented juice.
<Davie_Jones> In the US, only HARD Cider is alcoholic
<KetaminaDianePie> oooo that makes sense
<GarrettBrony> Cider is now the official drink of Brony Fandom
<TopHat> http://derpy.me/AhlAd
<StickySyrup> Lol hard cider in US = normal cider in UK
<KetaminaDianePie> Cheeers!
<MahBoi777> lol
<ben1994> :)
<Davie_Jones> You get Hard Cider by allowing Fresh Cider to ferment which will happen because cider has no preservatives
<derpy_pony> I though hard means distilled
<StickySyrup> I havnt seen non--alocoholic cider in UK at all
<derpy_pony> +t
<Davie_Jones> If you add preservatives to cider, you get juice
<MahBoi777> how does one make cider?
<UnFoundBug> Sticky, its just applejuice
<EspyLacopa> iddqd?
<ben1994> at leas good cyeder doesnt lol
<TopHat> not sure why I did that
<GarrettBrony> non alcoholic cider is thick apple juice
<StickySyrup> UnFoundBug: lol
<Davie_Jones> You crush apples.
<Davie_Jones> That's how you get cider
<MahBoi777> that's it?
<EspyLacopa> CRUSH!
<Rain> my friend said that the ponies were all drunks and I said that the cider was made and then served the next day. It didnt have time to ferment
<GarrettBrony> eeyup
<UnFoundBug> MahBoi, in US, crush apples, in UK, applejuice femented with yeast and honey
<Nyria> I wonder what cider taste like~
<Shizuka> 13wrek, mancubus takes three rockets, shoot at range as you run up
<Davie_Jones> You just crush and crush until they turn into liquid
*Midnight_Tempest jumps our of the shadows and glomps everyone
<Shizuka> 13or that
<KetaminaDianePie> :O
<UnFoundBug> made a batch once left it to ferment too long
<EspyLacopa> Rain: Sometimes they don't even wait a day.
<MahBoi777> I see, thank you

<Davie_Jones> And so is overworld bosses and dungeons.
<Dermathil> who is hyper hyped because of Phoenix Wright DUBS and SUBS in each regions???
<Davie_Jones> Like Skyward Sword has
<Davie_Jones> They are both the same in taht regard.
<Nyria> Oh Phase4 about that addon is there a chrome version?~
<Davie_Jones> Oh, and laser sword beams
<Phase4> Nyria: not yet, its aqward to get it to wark
*Dermathil is hyper hyped for the Phoenix Wright movie!!!
<Phase4> work'
<Phase4> aparently its hard to make chrome wark
<unfoundbug> hows that multiplatform? oh wait its nintendo
<fluttercry> 05,15HOLD IT! There's a Phoenix Wright movie?
<MirrorImage> is it bad that i'm more hyped for MLP Turnabout Storm III than i am for the actual Phoenix Wright movie?
<Nyria> Phase4: Oh okay~
<Mutterguy> There's amovie?
<Davie_Jones> What's your point? The game is built around the Wii's controler
<Dermathil> Mutterguy: yes.
<Dermathil> and the cast is GODLY.
<unfoundbug> motion controls are a bad interface
<MirrorImage> fluttercry; Mutterguy - in Japan, yes
<Nyria> indeed fluttercry~
<Davie_Jones> What, you can't get your sword skills up?
<unfoundbug> slow unresponsive
<Davie_Jones> Based on what, bug?
<MirrorImage> hang on, let me see if i can find the trailer
<unfoundbug> iv coded for the damn thing
<Dermathil> Mirrorimage: not only in japan anymore, because WORLDWIDE RELEASE
<Davie_Jones> In what game?
<Mutterguy> Butthatcould justne 12 angry men with loud music!
<Phase4> Nyria: i started on a chrome one, i'l try again. see if i cant make it work
<unfoundbug> its less baout actually using them
<Dermathil> teehee!!!!
<MirrorImage> http://kotaku.com/5868691/does-porno-graffitti-make-phoenix-wright-better?tag=phoenixwright
<unfoundbug> more pretending the user is doing what you want and blending it
<Ictiv> fluttercry: I heard there's even a stage musical
<Tovler||Insane> I was able to master Zelda's motion controls.
<Mutterguy> Sorry on my I pad
<MirrorImage> wait...
<Davie_Jones> In what game have you coded for the Wii motion plus?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4: it' seems i don't know how to use it xD
<unfoundbug> about*
<MirrorImage> yeah, that's right
<unfoundbug> whats the point of a game if its playing for me
<LordCelestia> 0,5============
<Phase4> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: see that muffin thats in your browser?
<Nyria> Phase4: Oh~! You don't have to, if you don't want to~ Though if you do I would love to download it and support it ^^
<MirrorImage> BEFORE I GET KICKED FOR THAT LINK - it is 100% clean, despite the link itself
<Davie_Jones> In what game have you coded for the Wii Motion Plus?
<Morty> *kssh* nom leader the books have arrived, over *kssh*
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Eww, CoD...
<Mutterguy> Cake or Death
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> lol
<unfoundbug> not a full game, tech demos using a BT adapter
*Davie_Jones highhoofs Tovler for his mad Zelda skillz
<Phase4> Nyria: its not a problem, theres a few people with chrome that want it and its worthwhile to learn how to do it
<Davie_Jones> What is BT?
<unfoundbug> plus is better yes, not good thoguh
<unfoundbug> bluetooth
<unfoundbug> hooked into my desktop
<unfoundbug> same as my kinnect
<Davie_Jones> What does Bluetooth have to do with Wii Motion Plus?
<Nyria> Phase4: I can't wait to see it come out ^^
<Phase4> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: it sometimes defaults to the addon bar, press ctrl+/ to make it apear
<Davie_Jones> Kinect works by taking pictures, not reading movement
<unfoundbug> so i can get the raw data off the wiimote and run on that
<MirrorImage> Davie_Jones - Wiimotes communicate with Bluetooth
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4: http://derpy.me/UNAdn oh right hadn't noticed it before
<TopHat> I don't get it
<TopHat> how does it work
<Davie_Jones> Tell me bug, what was the highest ratio you got it to work at?
<fluttercry> 05,15troll napalm
<LordCelestia> 0,5OBJECTION!
<unfoundbug> can't remember, was a while ago
<Davie_Jones> Was it before Wii Motion plus?
<Mutterguy> OVERRULED
<unfoundbug> after, cause getting the drivers to actually give me the plus data was a pain
<Mutterguy> or is it take that?
*kirzstryfe noms Morty
<Swaffy> KKKKKKKKKimori.
<Kimori> yes?
<Ictiv> Hold on...
<Morty> :3
<unfoundbug> its mostly just a gyro anyway

<Nyria> Hey Randomnerd~
<unfoundbug> well, there goes my train of thought
<Davie_Jones> Before you did taht, did you actually... play the game?
<LadyCanary> Hihi Randomnerd~
<IctivOfSillyfillydel> Now then

<Davie_Jones> Skyward Sword, I mean.

<Nyria> Is Skyword sword a good game?~

<LordCelestia> 0,5Guys
<Ictiv|Wizard> Or do you somehow presume that being a Wizard I have to look like a 13th century court jester?
<Davie_Jones> So because your indie games require you to make games that 'want' to be played sometimes, you believe it is the same in this case?

<SkilledSkillet> Ha as soon as I read that I flew off the map on Rock Of Ages
<Yahooz> well, yeah scratch out the personal part :$
<Yahooz> he typically noms on me and SB though
<Ictiv|Wizard> Well
<Morty> Superbrony64 is best pony
<unfoundbug> the PC version plays much better cause the aim isnt constantly dragged towards the nearest enemy
<Mutterguy> Warning SB64 has sccivated silly mode, prepare for nonsense and make it double
<Davie_Jones> What does that have to do with the Wii?
<Morty> <3
<Kimori> not much...you?
<Ictiv|Wizard> I think I'll need to get off for a while now. But I have a gift before I leave.

<Ictiv|Wizard> Take this SuperBrony64|Sili.
<Davie_Jones> Totalbiscet said so himself.

<Ictiv|Wizard> It's for you
<Nyria> that's rare~
<Yahooz> eeyup
<Randomnerd> Hm.
<unfoundbug> those who review games dont care bout gameplay at all anymore they want set pieces and graphics
*Ictiv|Wizard removes y from "you".
<Ictiv|Wizard> This also.
<SuperBrony64|Sili> 10,02I'm best pony? :O
<Dken2021> beautiful poem SB
<Morty> yuss
<unfoundbug> hence why uncharted does so well though its a terrible game
<Davie_Jones> Did you not say yourself that you thought Skyrim was pretty?
<LadyCanary> Then shout it out! Oink oink oink
<unfoundbug> yes
<Kimori> how far are you on it?
<Morty> :)
<unfoundbug> but it has gameplay behind it

<fluttercry> 05,15But Uncharted isn't terrible
<Ictiv|Wizard> Actually...
<Ictiv|Wizard> You come pretty close
<LadyCanary> It isnt!
<unfoundbug> graphics help, though they shouldnt be the core
<Ictiv|Wizard> R63 SuperBrony64 is best pony
<Davie_Jones> Yes, gameplay taht hasn't changed in years. Something you brought down on Zelda for doing.

<Davie_Jones> Then you have no right to speak criticly about anything concerning modern gaming
<Ictiv|Wizard> Awesomeness? Check-o do sole mio baby!
<unfoundbug> regnerating health, auto-aim, and the general downward trend of any sort of player impact is a mssive loss
<Lasharus> Oh dear, are we discussing the pros and cons of gaming reviews? Or merely the horror of the current direction of modern gaming?
<Dismo> Is there a stream going on right now?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Black Ops multiplayer on the wii? Now I've seen everything
<Kimori> Chaos is real tough
<Aicebo> this game is so addicting, I didn't think it was gonna be but omg @___@;
<Kimori> I was able to beat him with just the starter characters :)
<Ictiv|Wizard> Staff of Greatness? *flips magic staff* Check.
<Dken2021> I've yet to played any FPS this generation and kinda interested, even though I prefer RPGs
<Aicebo> cool
<Tovler||Insane> I'd complain if I had some LEVERAGE over the gaming industry.
<Ictiv|Wizard> One thing left to do.
<LadyCanary> Dat Wario.
<Davie_Jones> It used to be a Skyrim vs Skyward sword talk, but that broke down.
<Kimori> oh yeah, get rechargable batteries if you can
<Lasharus> I see.
<Ictiv|TimeLord> Well then.
<Ictiv|TimeLord> See ya all sometime.
<Kimori> that way you wont get stuck
<Mutterguy> In mah day is was complete the game or chose your own arbitrary means to win
<Aicebo> my mom got an 8 pack so I should be okay for awhile :)
<Morty> cya boss
*Ictiv|TimeLord disappears.
<Davie_Jones> It turned into a "I hate what Skyward Sword does, except when Skyrim does it."
*LunaTheBeloved hugs Ictive
<LunaTheBeloved> Bye
<Nyria> The best FPS I've played would always be Half life~
<Kimori> true
<unfoundbug> half life was good
<Davie_Jones> Amen, Nyria
<Aicebo> drobot is my big weapon
<pinkydash> Another EQD pony mission
<Scoot-Scootaloo> The best FPS will always be Halo: CE before it was remade :3
<pinkydash> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/01/reddit-and-imdb-pony-groups-seeking.html
<unfoundbug> just when we all agree...
<Davie_Jones> You little kid
<Mutterguy> Didn't get past picking up the crowbar....
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Counter strike~
<unfoundbug> halo is definately among the greats
<Nyria> hey be nice~ It's his opinion~
<Davie_Jones> NO it isn't
<Nyria> And I like halo as well :3
<Davie_Jones> It's a overhyped garbage game for fratbrothers
<Tovler||Insane> I totally see myself skipping console gaming all together.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> The first Halo was ok
<Lasharus> Oh no...
<Nyria> It was actually one of my first FPS games~
<Lasharus> Can I make a request of the mods?
<LunaTheBeloved> First Halo is best Halo imo
<fluttercry> 05,15The best FPS ever was Half-Life
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> agreed
<Lasharus> End this discussion before it turns into an FPS flamewar? :P
<Nyria> mhm~
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I liked Half life 2. The first one...
<Dken2021> never played portal yet I love it
<LunaTheBeloved> Agreed
<unfoundbug> portal was very good
<Phase4> ^
<Phase4> ^^^
<Davie_Jones> Portal was great
<Nyria> Portal was great~
<unfoundbug> 2 looked better in the previews
<Davie_Jones> Perfect game.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> <3 Potral
<Mutterguy> You can't beat duke nukes for cheap thrills though...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> portal*
<fluttercry> 05,15Portal 2 has great writing
<unfoundbug> but they took out alot of the good stuff cause the playtesters found it hard
<Davie_Jones> 2 only looked bad because the first was Perfect.
<Phase4> Mutterguy: yes you can, portal is cheeper
*Scoot-Scootaloo has never played Poortal 2
<Tovler||Insane> I enjoyed looking for the white walls in Portal 2.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> portal*
<Nyria> You should it's a great game~
<Mutterguy> * duke nukem 3d( the original one)
<fluttercry> 05,15yes!
<unfoundbug> I still play that game
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Seriously though, I'm a halo fanboy :3
<fluttercry> 05,15It's time to kicks ass and chew bubble gum, and I'm all out of gum.
<Dken2021> I need another current gen console
<unfoundbug> nothing ever quite matches skrinking an enemy and squashing them under your boot
*Davie_Jones gags
*Scoot-Scootaloo raises sheild
<unfoundbug> shrinking*
<Davie_Jones> Talk about bad writting. And it got worse in Duke Nukem Forever.
<Boodfire> time-splitters is the best console shooter ever
<unfoundbug> lol, it wasnt about the writing in that gae
<unfoundbug> game*
<fluttercry> 05,15Did anyone else every play Goldeneye on N64?
<unfoundbug> it was one liners and OTT bad guys
<Dken2021> also interested in playing time splitters
<Scoot-Scootaloo> YES!!!
<Davie_Jones> They should make a mod that turned off Duke's Voice
<unfoundbug> Now that really was the best shooter ever made
<Scoot-Scootaloo> It was oaky...
<Davie_Jones> Yes, Goldeneye was always fun.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> okay*
<Dken2021> me and my friends only play multiplayer in goldeneye
<Davie_Jones> Four player deathmatch with my brothers was awesome.
<Mutterguy> Davie at the time I don't think they were worried about the writing. It was a simple time
<Davie_Jones> Glad we all grew up then
<Dken2021> never touched singleplayer
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Perfect Dark was also pretty good
<Nyria> I hate it when games are 100% different from the other console it was also made on~
<LadyCanary> I remember seeing a brother of a friend play Goldeneye when I was young
<fluttercry> 05,15But it was so good! And it's the whole reason Console shooters even exist
<Davie_Jones> What is?
<Dken2021> but it's so dated now though
<Nyria> <3 Ps2
<pinkydash> kirzstryfe
<pinkydash> stop nom-ing Yahooz
<Davie_Jones> What about it is dated?
<pinkydash> I can't talk to him like this >_>
<Dken2021> goldeneye
<Phase4> dafaq, i just started the stream
<Davie_Jones> What about it?
<unfoundbug> goldeneye isnt dated in the least
<Yahooz> ?
<Yahooz> pinkydash im working silly XD
<pinkydash> AH YAHOOZ'S BACK
<Nyria> I remember playing the old spongebob games~
<pinkydash> Oh

<Scoot-Scootaloo> Not on the 360 -_-
<KetaminaDianePie> sonic yaaaaaaaaay!

<Tovler||Insane> dude bro, the CMC are cool.
<Dken2021> Davie_Jones no like CMC?
<Nyria> Or "Xbox exclusive"
<unfoundbug> What about ME3?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is not okay, the only thing you're allowed to do is reallyreallyreallyreally, dislike them
<TopHat> sweet
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I did play on Steam, but then I went to college and I couldn't bring my computer with me :'(
<Aicebo> cool that's one on my wishlist
<Phase4> i love the effect speed has on sound
*Midnight_Tempest is esstatic about ME3 and wants it nao!
<Davie_Jones> No. It's like.. every episode they touch turns into.... manure.
<Nyria> Oh~ well Scoot-Scootaloo if you want I'm on steam ^^
<unfoundbug> Same here
<Aicebo> so far I've got at least 1 of every element except fire
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm skeptical about the ME3 multiplayer
<BEN> Scoot-Scootaloo: should have gotten a haunted Majora's Mask!
<Nyria> Wait who else is on steam?~
<Scoot-Scootaloo> DON"T DROWN!!!
<unfoundbug> is there a group?

<Scoot-Scootaloo> eeyup
<Dken2021> Davie_Jones would you watch an episode of them if they got their cutie marks the right way?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I can't play on this computer, since its a piece of crap laptop :/
<Nyria> Oh... aw~
<Davie_Jones> Yes
<KetaminaDianePie> Hey!
<Nyria> I was hoping all of us could play sometime~
<Midnight_Tempest> i cant play this on my comp without a controller...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I have my 360, so I'm fine with that :3
<Davie_Jones> I would love to see an episode where they don't carry the idoit ball in their skulls
<BEN> wait theres a bronystate steam group? how come I didnt know about this? :'(
<unfoundbug> is it the one named "Brony Movie Night"?
<Tovler> A CMC episode in 1.5 weeks. Can't wait

<Scoot-Scootaloo> Yeah, Live is pretty BS, but for some reason, I can't stop paying D:
*Scoot-Scootaloo is a corporate sheep
<unfoundbug> it is annoying to find it
<LadyCanary> You're under the spell of Microsoft, Scoots.
<fluttercry> 05,15oh so am I. I still use xbox
<unfoundbug> i think the last game i buy on xbox will be ME3, i want my saves to much to move to pc
<Midnight_Tempest> i use xbox, when its connected... but im a pc and ps3 player mostly
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I have a dumb laptop and a Mac. Macs are terrible gaming computers >: (

<Midnight_Tempest> that sucks...
*Nyria has never used a mac other than in school~
<unfoundbug> my condolences
<Nyria> And there not that good when it comes to flash~
<unfoundbug> lol, apple hated flash so much they pushed html5
<unfoundbug> cause they have more control over that
*Tovler has only used macs outside of school. forlorn.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Macs have their uses sometimes, but I prefer to steer clear of them
<Scoot-Scootaloo> My roomate is the only one who uses the one in our dorm
<LadyCanary> I've only used family member's Macbooks. But A LOT of people in school have them
*Nyria used to use defult browser until 1 month ago~

<Dken2021> it confuses me

<Phase4> thehated5689: you must be thinking of a different game

<LordCelestia> 0,5WAT
<LadyCanary> Wat wat?
<Randomnerd> "ACTA"
<Dken2021> you just now hearin about this?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Oh
<LordCelestia> 0,5Wow
<Randomnerd> That's international.
<LordCelestia> 0,5REALLY
<LordCelestia> 0,5You JUST heard about this?
<LordCelestia> 0,5-_-
<Nyria> Hey~ not his fault~
<Tovler> ACTA? the bill USA signed in October?
<Randomnerd> That's the problem, they try to keep it under wraps.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> inb4 slowbro(?) nah just kidding but really it's been out for a while now :p
<Phase4> who posted 'go the distance'?
<unfoundbug> Ah no, just got a notification in my email thats a fair bit dated
<LordCelestia> 0,5Sorry, its just, Bronystate has been advertising it for a while now.
<GabeMoist> me
<EspyLacopa> http://i.imgur.com/y0J6w.jpg
<LordCelestia> 0,5SAY NO TO ACTA
<CriticKitten> Too late.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Its worse than SOPA
<Phase4> GabeMoist: you posted go the distance
<Randomnerd> What do you think we have Freakshows like the Kardashians?!
<Phase4> ?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Its not too late...
<Randomnerd> Why*
<CriticKitten> Virtually every first-world nation has already signed it. >_>
<Tovler> lol, we were telling people to ST_U about SOPA/PIPA in October.
<LordCelestia> 0,5It wont be too late until like June of this year.
<LordCelestia> 0,5But the more we act.
<GabeMoist> I posted it as in posted in this chat
<LordCelestia> 0,5We better well do.
<CriticKitten> The EU, for the most part, signed it about a week or two ago.
<IshBestKitty> meow
<fluttercry> 05,15booo
<Phase4> gabe.. i cant tab complete your name for some reason
<Nyria> haha EspyLacopa~
<CriticKitten> The US signed it in October along with Canada and a few others.
<Randomnerd> It's definitely worse than SOPA, because it's got more signatories. SOPA was unenforcable.
*Scoot-Scootaloo thinks Fallout New Vegas is scary
<GabeMoist> What are you doing to my name?
<Nyria> <3 Fallout: NV
<CriticKitten> There's little left to fight it with, when almost everyone has already signed onto it.
<unfoundbug> You should play Amnesia
<Phase4> GabeMoist: thanks for posting that, neat music
<IshBestKitty> mew
<unfoundbug> Amnesia: Dark Descent
<fluttercry> 05,15Question, should I buy Counter Strike or Counter Strike Source.
<NullRadix> signed != law
<CriticKitten> This isn't like SOPA where the bill hadn't even reached the point at which it COULD be approved. ACTA already HAS been.
*Nyria pets IshBestKitty~
<Nyria> Hey there~
<Wrek> 05justine beats dark descent
<unfoundbug> CS:S will have more players
<unfoundbug> hmmm
<GabeMoist> I thought it was awesome, so I thought you guys might want to hear it
*IshBestKitty prrs and rubs against Nyria
<Swaffy> Haaaaaiii
<unfoundbug> CounterStrike Source
<Swaffy> Hawaii
<CriticKitten> It's not a law, NullRadix, it's a trade agreement.
<Nyria> Oh Wreky~ I thought you where getting some sleep~
<Phase4> my chat is atempting suicide, brb
*Scoot-Scootaloo played Amnesia. Nightmares were recurring and paronia attacks were had....
<Wrek> 05as did I
<Swaffy> Crap. Too late.
<CriticKitten> And its effects are technically supposed to be in place already.
<Kimori> its ok
<Tovler> I'm sad that Megaupload is guilty until proven innocent.
<LadyCanary> Ohai IshBestKitty
<Dken2021> anyone seen that moviebob episode about sopa?
<Swaffy> : (
<NullRadix> as I recall, there was something about the individual countries still having to agree with it, like Congress haven't to approve the president's signature
<unfoundbug> they were already proved guilty
*IshBestKitty purrs and rubs against LadyCanary
<Phase4> there we go
<Swaffy> Kimori
<Phase4> ohai NullRadix
*LadyCanary pets the kitty
<Kimori> hm?
<CriticKitten> They just haven't set up the infrastructure for it yet, as I recall.
<Shizuka> 13nya?
<NullRadix> evening Phase4
<unfoundbug> internal emails were seized which showed them knowing about illegal content and using it for personal gai
<CriticKitten> NullRadix: Most of the EU signed it less than two weeks ago.

*Flaria brohoofs Phase4 for movie
*Phase4 brohoof's Flaria
<Nyria> Flaria~!
<unfoundbug> ah thanks, it got left in the message window, that 'n' was lonely
<thehated5689> who is the man on the stream, btw?
<Swaffy> I don't remember.
<Tovler> If all MegaUpload files are deleted, how will they prove that MU was largely used for legal stuff.
*Nyria hugs Flaria~
<CriticKitten> And the only way that Congress can override the president's vote, as far as the US goes, is for them to find a way to legally declare ACTA as a treaty.
*Flaria hugs Nyria~
<Phase4> problem with ACTA: it is IMPOSIBLE to impliment the level of regulation the bill calls for
<Swaffy> Have you tried Google Talk before?
<Phase4> as in imposible, cannot be done
<CriticKitten> But it's not, not really. It's a trade agreement, and Congress has no say in the president's ability to sign trade agreements, technically.
<TopHat> Trapped forever! ACTA! ACTA!
<Phase4> there is way to much bandwidth to filter
<NullRadix> I'm no law expert, but again from what I've been hearing is that while the countries signed it, it still hasn't been through proper legal processes at 'home' for respective values of home... I could be wrong
<Kimori> nope never
<CriticKitten> Here's the basics:
<IshBestPony> I'm gonna sing the doom song, doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom
<Phase4> ^
<TopHat> thats the basics?
<CriticKitten> Congress can't do squat about it unless one of two things can be proven:
<Nyria> Gir is so adorable~
<Swaffy> A friend from Xbox and I are using it to make a Minecraft commentary. Since Google Talk is VoIP, we can live chat while recording our voice and game.
<CriticKitten> 1) That ACTA enforces new laws on the United States (which hasn't been, and indeed cannot be, concretely proven from a legal standpoint at this time)
<Kimori> you play together?
<CriticKitten> 2) That ACTA serves the function of a treaty, thereby falling under Congress's duties as part of their ability to regulate commerce.
<CriticKitten> Neither of these are actually options, and neither is a priority since all eyes have been turned to the presidental primaries.
<Swaffy> On a server. Do you play the game?
<Randomnerd> Senate votes on Treaties
<CriticKitten> Yes. But it's not a treaty, that's my point.
<LordCelestia> 0,5I know what will happen
<LordCelestia> 0,5If it does pass,
<IshBestPony> doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom
<TopHat> bacon
<CriticKitten> Congress would have to prove that it IS a treaty, and they can't. Because it's not.
<Randomnerd> ^
<LordCelestia> 0,5ACTA passes. Riots. Hacking. Illegal actions. Rebellion. Lives ruined. Massive lawsuit. The people will win.
<KetaminaDianePie> nope
<LordCelestia> 0,5So dont worry.
<GabeMoist> If it passes, we overthrow the government and declare LordCelestia as world ruler
<CriticKitten> "passes"
<CriticKitten> It's not a law
<CriticKitten> xD
<LordCelestia> 0,5Oh well
<fluttercry> 05,15Anarchy in Bronystate! *throws fire bomb*
<LordCelestia> 0,5You know what I mean
<IshBestPony> GabeMoist and I will challenge that title
<CriticKitten> It's a trade agreement and it's already taken effect technically.
<Nyria> I would like to see an up rise~
*Shizuka 13is set on fire .-.
<LordCelestia> 0,5NO
<unfoundbug> Im worried about what will be tantamant to a digital war between governemnts and hackers
<Randomnerd> Well, at this point, I'm expecting it's more likely someone will make their own internet.
<Tovler> I'd kill to be able to vote "no confidence" on the ballot.
<Kimori> no I dont
<Swaffy> Hmm. I wonder if Google Talk does three way calls.
*LordCelestia douses Shizuka with a bucket of water
*LordCelestia 0,5douses Shizuka with a bucket of water
<CriticKitten> It's just that the infrastructure demanded by ACTA has not actually been put in place yet.
<KetaminaDianePie> omg again
<CriticKitten> So it is binding for all of the people who have signed, but cannot yet be enforced.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Oh well
*thehated5689 played this game and regretted it
<fluttercry> 05,15well that was a short lived riot
<Photon-Phoenix> <GabeMoist> If it passes, we overthrow the government and declare LordCelestia as world ruler <-- free trips to the moon for everyone!
<LordCelestia> 0,5With no internet, lives will be ruined. That calls for lawsuits in some cases.
*Shizuka 13is now wet .-.
<Randomnerd> Seriously, a bunch of guys back in the 70s made the Internet for the DoD, it'd probably be easier to do now since there are more programmers.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Especially if suicide / crimes occur
*Tovler watches as Occupy fizzles out.
<CriticKitten> Wetmane Shizuka
<thehated5689> wait
<CriticKitten> :o
<thehated5689> wait what
*Nyria gives Shizuka a towl~
*LordCelestia 0,5dries Shizuka off with his towel and sits her down on a nearby lounge chair.
<Nyria> towel*
*Flaria huggles Shizuka and dries her off with her natural warmth
<Tovler> I wonder if Americans protestors are capable of self-immolation
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm sorry i set you on fire Shizuka
<LordCelestia> 0,5mfw team frying effort
<unfoundbug> What......
*LordCelestia 0,5sets fluttercry on fire and does NOT douse it.
<thehated5689> so... confuzed...
<KetaminaDianePie> ahhahahhahahaha Tovler
<unfoundbug> *douses All the fire*
*fluttercry jumps in the river
*unfoundbug douses ALL fire
*GabeMoist freezes LordCelestia
*IshBestPony dispenses ham to everypony
<Randomnerd> The problem is that if you look at the underlying principles of this rot, it seems as if even Libraries would need to be shut down.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Oh no! he fell into the pihranna river!
*thehated5689 sets river on fire
<Randomnerd> Enough with the fire!
<Nyria> I think fillies shouldn't play with fire...
<LordCelestia> 0,5FIYAH
<fluttercry> 05,15Oh god! The teeth!
<GabeMoist> Randomnerd, of course, libraries are evil
*unfoundbug sets the fire on fire
<CriticKitten> Eh, to be fair, a lot of this has been overblown.
*thehated5689 <_<
*IshBestPony douses everything with a bucket of greek fire
<TopHat> this is basically every kirby boss
<thehated5689> yo dawg, i heard u like fire, so i put some fire on the fire
*Tovler loves how Dan from Dan Vs tries to set everything on fire.
<LadyCanary> ...Fire bad! fire bad!
<unfoundbug> bet dash could put it out though
<CriticKitten> SOPA and PIPA and now ACTA are being made into boogeymen that will come into your house and steal your unborn children, rather than just a desperate act by a dying collective of dinosaur industries that want to stay relevant.
<IshBestPony> ...Fire good! fire good!
<Nyria> I remember burning my hand a lot when I was little~
*Flaria hugs thehated5689
<Flaria> Long time no see.
<Flaria> I think
<unfoundbug> Too the MOOOOON with fire
<CriticKitten> It would be far easier to just boycott the ever-living hell out of those groups.
<Tovler> Fire cleanses your pores
*thehated5689 hugs flaria
<thehated5689> heyo again!
<IshBestPony> unfoundbug great job, now even the moon's on fire
<Randomnerd> The idea that a company should be able to get a government to do the hard work for them is pretty reprehensible.
*Tovler sets Saturn on fire
<LadyCanary> D: Nuuuuuu
<unfoundbug> theres no air on the moon for a fire to survive
<Nyria> There's oxygen on the moon o.o
<TopHat> yes
<IshBestPony> unfondbug its magic fire, it needs no oxygen
<CriticKitten> Randomnerd: Hi, let's meet capitalism
<thehated5689> dat game was so addicting
<unfoundbug> fine ill find magic water
<IshBestPony> unfoundbug quit interfering with the fire
<CriticKitten> Ah yes, capitalist. The wonderful system by which the richest corporations petition the government to get special benefits that allow them to kill their competition!
<unfoundbug> at least only burn SOPA/PIPA supporters
<Nyria> I feel that history repeats itself so many times~
<CriticKitten> Sort of like exactly how SOPA was intended to work!
<Randomnerd> CrtiicKitten I'm not disagreeing with you.
<CriticKitten> You want to get rid of corporate interference? You need to get rid of capitalism. Not half-heartedly either.
<CriticKitten> *Entirely*.
<IshBestPony> I'm gonna sing the doom song, doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom
<Nyria> Well that's it for me I'm going to sleep~
<CriticKitten> It's the RIAA and such today, it'll be other corporations tomorrow. :P
<Nyria> Goodnight everybody~
<CriticKitten> G'night Nyria!
<thehated5689> gnight nyria :)
<Randomnerd> Well, there's going to be corruption in any system, but capitalism is the only system I've seen where it's actually rewarded.
<SkilledSkillet> Macht Nyria
<Randomnerd> Bye, Nyria
<SkilledSkillet> *Nacht
*IshBestPony cough*revolution*cough
<unfoundbug> G'Night
*Tovler uses holy water to bring back the Bretton Woods system.
<LordCelestia> 0,5http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPiV_SB-scM&feature=youtu.be
*Flaria hugs Nyria
<Flaria> Sleep well~
*Nyria hugs Flaria back~
<CriticKitten> That's because most people only know of two systems: capitalism which is wholesome and good, and socialism which is the devil. So sayeth Fox News. :p
<Tovler> Liberal is a bad word?
<unfoundbug> socialism has never actually been implemented
<fluttercry> 05,15The Cold War made america terrified of anything slightly left.
<Randomnerd> Well, any system that uses taxes for government services is "socialized"
*IshBestPony cough*overthrow congress*cough
<CriticKitten> Eh, it was more McCarthy and the Red Scare, to be fair
<Randomnerd> The Army uses tax money to provide a service that no private agency could provide
*IshBestPony cough*new world order*cough
<fluttercry> 05,15Well yeah, and now socialism is always thought to be the stepping stone to communism. IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT
<SuperBrony64|Sili> 10,02What does PTFO stand for?
*Tovler wonders how the world didn't go into an economic meltdown after Europe was destroyed in WWII.
<unfoundbug> @Tovler, loans from america
<CriticKitten> Eeyup
<IshBestPony> SuperBrony64|Sili Party the F:Ok On?
<unfoundbug> also, was mostly france
<SuperBrony64|Sili> 10,02Oh...is Wrek mad?
<unfoundbug> who got the money from the germans
<Randomnerd> Comprehensive conspiracies don't work in the end. Event conspiracies are possible, if improbable. How does the NWO work? If the participants are really that vicious, wouldn't they just murder one another?
<unfoundbug> Wrek should be asleep
<NullRadix> Randomnerd: you could go with the FO Raiders theory: Like likes like
<VioletVanilla> 06.-.
<CriticKitten> The only way that large-scale overthrowing of a government works is if Lelouch is the one leading it. In any other situation it sorta doesn't fly. >_>
<IshBestPony> cough*viva la revolution*cough
<Randomnerd> Much like the theory of Tyrant Celestia, to bring back ponies...
<fluttercry> 05,15I don't think revolt is necessary.
<Tovler> I'll wait for the next global economic meltdown before I make a move.
<IshBestPony> fluttercry that won't keep it from happening
*thehated5689 hands ishbestpony a cough drop "are you sick or something?"
*Shizuka 13curls up with vivi by the fireplace~
<Randomnerd> Celestia didn't send Luna to the moon because she was jealous of her power, she sent her to the moon because authority figures fuck up.
<fluttercry> 05,15The government just needs to hit the reset button.
<CriticKitten> Revolution could have worked back when citizens had roughly the same weapons as soldiers and the lines between them were blurred. Nowadays standard riot police could end a revolt, much less our military. Of course that assumes revolt is even ideal. :p
*unfoundbug darts around at mention of fire
<Randomnerd> Looking for the easiest way to solve a problem, she did something horrible.
*IshBestPony sets unfoundbug n fire
<IshBestPony> *on
*Phase4 is a silly filly
<unfoundbug> NOOOOOOOo
*unfoundbug is on fire
<Phase4> spent all that time using hidden frames when all i needed was "req.responseText.match(/a href=\"http:\/\/derpy.me\/(.+)\"/)"
<CriticKitten> Best way: political parties go into a biiiiiiiig bonfire and are never spoken of again~
*IshBestPony in beavis voice "yeah, fire, fire"
<PonyBlade> HI everlasting_joy !!!!
<Phase4> someone slap me with a trout for being so silly
<Randomnerd> CriticKitten. Very true. No redneck with a fully automatic AK-47 is going to impress a Carrier Strike Group.
*fluttercry slaps Phase4 around with a large trout
<unfoundbug> oh god, trout slapping, not seen that in a long time
<Everlasting_Joy> Slaps Phase4.
*IshBestPony pulls out prosciutto wrapped trout
<Phase4> fluttercry: thx
*thehated5689 slaps phase4 with a cooked trout
<unfoundbug> mIRC much
*IshBestPony hits Phase4 with it
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey PonyBlade.
<Randomnerd> I'd like to hear from our European Bronies... are they happy with multi-party politics?
<PonyBlade> howdy
*Phase4 is now covered in fish
*GabeMoist slaps himslef around a bit with a large trout
*Tovler sets corporate jets on fire.
<unfoundbug> I am
<Randomnerd> In the US, all that one party has to do is be less disgusting than the other.
<IshBestPony> Phase4 you smell like fish, go take a bath
<Everlasting_Joy> What's new with you?
*Phase4 is off to bathe
*thehated5689 eats the cooked trout
<LunaTheBeloved> What is this madness?
<PonyBlade> oh just more poniez
<thehated5689> acta, trout, and politics, of couurse
<PonyBlade> so nothin too new
<unfoundbug> At the moment in the UK we hve a coalition, and i think its the best iv seen, they actually have to work together to get stuff done
<SkilledSkillet> The best kind Luna
<LunaTheBeloved> Sounds like US Congress
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Forza Motorsport 4 is better than this thing...
<unfoundbug> even if it is alot of "were screwed over by labour before us"
<Everlasting_Joy> Small world.
*IshBestPony cough*overthrow congress*cough
<PonyBlade> Eeyup
<KetaminaDianePie> :O
<sandvich> what is streaming right now?
<Randomnerd> That might be neccessary, IshBestPony ... the trouble is that our rules are so crappy anyone who replaces these people will do the same thing. All the "Bugs" have been figured out.
*Tovler will never trust again :'(
*IshBestPony cough*alone we are powerless and weak together we are strong and powerfull*cough
<thehated5689> randomnerd a montag of videos
<thehated5689> *montage
<unfoundbug> its been on loop a while now
<unfoundbug> though interestingly, 45 viewers on stream 103 people in chat
<Randomnerd> Madison was brilliant, but he could have never anticipated a corporation could be so big that it could just bribe *everyone*
<KetaminaDianePie> old SB vreruns sandvich
<IshBestPony> Randomnerd thats why we change the rules to ensure the same mistakes aren't made again
<Roxsnow> Hello everyone : 3
<CriticKitten> Oh, oh! Pick me! I have a plan! It's called "force government to become a public service as it was intended to be". Pay them a pittance of what they get now, set hard caps on advertisement and spending, kill off the Super-PAC system....
<Randomnerd> Well, we'd make new mistakes ;)
<unfoundbug> Hi Rox
<Everlasting_Joy> hi Roxsnow.
<KetaminaDianePie> the same...... over and over and sover,,,,,,
<thehated5689> hi roxsnow
<Phase4> http://i.imgur.com/y0J6w.jpg not a clue who posted this but its awesome
<Phase4> hi Roxsnow
<pony_336559> :)
<Roxsnow> oh hello Phase4 : 3
<Randomnerd> CriticKitten: It's not that simple. Without a salary, it'd be a rich man's hobby anyway.
<LadyCanary> Hihi Roxsnow
<Roxsnow> and also, you won the lotto Phase4 : o?
*IshBestPony is having french fry burps
<Roxsnow> and hello LadyCanary : 3
<Phase4> that i did:)
<Roxsnow> dat feeling when you win the first time : 3
<Roxsnow> : 3
<Phase4> ikr
<KetaminaDianePie> ahahahahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<CriticKitten> Not necessarily. If you make the office accessible to a middle-class citizen, they will run.
<CriticKitten> Right now, they are not.
*Roxsnow felt off guard when he saw his name : 3
<KetaminaDianePie> th Phase4
<Randomnerd> It'd have to be a much shorter term.
<Randomnerd> Or far less demanding.
<CriticKitten> Because it costs millions to run.
<Saturn> 8,1http://i.imgur.com/duc9F.jpg
<Saturn> 8,1i took this the other night
<Saturn> 8,1no telescope, just a kit lens
<LadyCanary> ...Wow.
<Phase4> my god, its full of stars
<Randomnerd> But a middle-class ciitzen still needs a *job*
<GabeMoist> very nice
<LadyCanary> That's absolutely beautiful.
<CriticKitten> They have staff who read the bills they vote on FOR THEM, how much actual work do you think they do anymore?
<GabeMoist> I have some pics of stars
<Phase4> Saturn: nice telescope
<meh> i never see stars here
<Saturn> 8,1Phase4: no telescope
<Everlasting_Joy> You're missing out meh.
<meh> i know
<IshBestPony> can't we all live in a peacefull society, like the smurfs, or the ponies
<Randomnerd> Congress requires constant campaigning as it is.
<KetaminaDianePie> good raw material
<Phase4> Saturn: oh, i derp read sometimes. nice camera
<Saturn> 8,1<3
<Everlasting_Joy> IshBestPony that would be asking too much.
*Tovler grows a Stalin moustache in protest.
<CriticKitten> No it doesn't.
<CriticKitten> They've just MADE it that way.
<Saturn> 8,1also, prince-dari, i have a present for you: http://imgur.com/rxrXT
<Randomnerd> It always took campaignig, it just had a smaller pool of voters.
<xcanox> Is it SFW?!
<CriticKitten> Running for president does not require that the campaign start 2 years into the existing guy's term. >_>
<Shizuka> 13oh dear
<Saturn> 8,1teehee
<LadyCanary> ...Saturn, you just opened the portal to hell. WHY.
<Randomnerd> Pols also used to not campaign on their own.
<Shizuka> 13he gon beat you
<thehated5689> good ogd
<Roxsnow> Oh you Saturn ...
<afKirz> 1,3lol
<CriticKitten> It could easily be done in a much shorter span, but no one wants to do that because they like to drag it all out.
<LadyCanary> Beating is an understatement
<Phase4> that guy to the right of the doctors head looks like a creeper
<CriticKitten> It makes them money.
<Randomnerd> Parties would disseminate speeches that were delivered by local agents of the party.
<IshBestPony> bai everypony cough*viva la revolution*cough
<Phase4> later IshBestPony
<unfoundbug> cya ishbestpony
<thehated5689> bai ishbestpony
<SkilledSkillet> ByeIsh
<Everlasting_Joy> Aww. .. later IshBestPony.
<Roxsnow> Bye ishbestpony : 3
<Randomnerd> Say I was a D-R in 1800, -Bye, IshBestPony - I would have never met my candidate
<Randomnerd> But I'd be sent a speech, and I'd be told to deliver it on his behalf.
<GabeMoist> Saturn, do you which part of the sky did you photograph?
*IshBestPony hugs Phase4 and unfoundbug and thehated5689 and SkilledSkillet and Everlasting_Joy and Roxsnow and Randomnerd
<SkilledSkillet> yay
<Everlasting_Joy> Hugs IshBestPony and watches him/her depart.
<Randomnerd> This worked at the time because there was no effective means of the candidate reaching the masses on their own.
<Tovler> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sZjpStFNY&feature=related
<Randomnerd> When a congressman only has to talk to a group of a few hundred white males, he can get them all in a few big meetings in a few weeks.
<Randomnerd> Our voting pool is much bigger, now.
<Randomnerd> This is good, but it makes that sort of thing impractical.
<thehated5689> alternative vote?
<CriticKitten> And yet we purposefully drag out the campaign term MUCH longer than necessary.
<SparkTech> Hai
<CriticKitten> The population is larger but the technology is also VASTLY improved.
<GabeMoist> you're killing me Saturn
<thehated5689> hola sparktech
<Everlasting_Joy> Hi SparkTech
<Dken2021> heyo SparkTech
<Randomnerd> Well, the presidential Campaign is literally longer.
<thehated5689> dken2021 >_>
<SparkTech> *Shudders* I really shouldn't be reading Creepypasta at 9 aclock..But oh well...
<Randomnerd> Iowa and NH used to be held in March.
<Randomnerd> Hell, I remember when I was a boy it was held in March.
<Randomnerd> Congressmen used to campaign more, and the legislative season was shorter.
<Randomnerd> Well, I misspoke. The Legislative season was shorter, but Congressmen campaigned much differently than they do now.
<Randomnerd> Retail politics were the only method.
<Randomnerd> And the Presidential candidates didn't go out and do retail politics on their own.
<Randomnerd> As I said, local party operatives did the legwork.
<Randomnerd> There's no easy answer, per se, but with a parliamentary-style voting process, we could at least stop voting for the lesser of two evils.
<MahBoi777> hello
<fillyfillyy> im back all
<Saturn> 8,1GabeMoist: i just pointed my camera up to a patch of sky that wasn't cloudy
<Morty> ohai
<Everlasting_Joy> MahBoi777 This greetings is what all true warriors strive FOUR!
<thehated5689> well, look at the time
<Saturn> 8,1didn't really aim it at anything
<GabeMoist> hmm
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello
*thehated5689 throws smoke ball on the ground
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy fillyfillyy.
*thehated5689 escapes
<Randomnerd> Hey, MahBoi777, Hey fillyfillyy
<fillyfillyy> hi everyone
<MahBoi777> Everlasting_Joy: I wonder what's for dinner.
<unfoundbug> welcome back
<Saturn> 8,1but that was on a moderately bad night for seeing, bit of cloud up, and with a 300mm focal length
<MahBoi777> hey fillyfillyy
<fillyfillyy> hey MahBoi777
<GabeMoist> Is it a large of small part of the sky?
<Tovler> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJjvV0t_3Qw best vocals ever.
<Saturn> 8,1i think i could have gotten a much better pic with a shorter focal length and some better caera settings
<Saturn> 8,1and better sky conditions
<Randomnerd> Perhaps the thing that disgusts me most about corruption is that US politicians sell out for so little.
<GabeMoist> I've taken some pictures of the sky. pictures of the sky are cool
<Everlasting_Joy> Randomnerd, you act like human depravity has a limit. That's all I'm going to say.
<MahBoi777> money, it's all about the money
<Randomnerd> In some countries, a bribe comes with the implicit threat of murder for non-compliance. Yet still some people refuse.
<fillyfillyy> should i color my Pinkie Pie picture?
<MahBoi777> the love of money is the root of all evil
<Saturn> 8,1fillyfillyy: do it, filly!
<Tovler> and yet, we vote for them anyway while merely shaking our head at people who don't vote.
<Everlasting_Joy> fillyfillyy you should show us it.
<fillyfillyy> well take a look http://derpy.me/5jaNE i think it would ruin it
<MahBoi777> do it filly
<Randomnerd> Well, if you don't vote, they won't listen.
<LadyCanary> Well, if Pink Floyd says that money is the root of all evil, MahBoi777, then it must be true.
<MirrorImage> Randomnerd - SOPA.
<Randomnerd> If you vote and they ignore you, it's a tragedy.
<GabeMoist> Saturn, here's a picture I took a while back
<GabeMoist> http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/8608/orion6small.jpg
<Everlasting_Joy> fillyfilly color it.
<Randomnerd> If you say "they don't care" and not vote, they will do as they please.
<MirrorImage> it's not about "voting," it's about shouting with a loud enough voice
<Randomnerd> I vote and shout.
<MirrorImage> unfortunately, democracy tames most shouts
<fillyfillyy> so MahBoi777 and Everlastin_Joy should i color it.. after you saw it
<MirrorImage> hence: Occupy, Anonymous, etc
<Dken2021> GabeMoist where wa that light coming from?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Well See ya later everyone~, i'm going to read for a while, Goonight~
<Randomnerd> I have missed ONE local election in my eight years as an active voter.
*Tovler wonders if Derpy will be replaced with Screwball
<MahBoi777> yes you should color it
*Flaria hugs TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Flaria> Bai~
<Flaria> Sleep well~
<StinkomanFan> Anypony know Latin?
<MirrorImage> Tovler - nah, but i half suspect they may revoice her
<GabeMoist> Dken, the light in the sky?
<Dken2021> bye ba The_Browncoat
<fillyfillyy> im gonna trace it 1st to find the right shade
<Saturn> 8,1GabeMoist: nice!
<Randomnerd> I don't know whether it's writing my congressman, voting, or signing petitions, but I'm not qutting one in favor of the other.
<MahBoi777> alright
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT hugs Flaria back~ ^^
<Flaria> :'3
<Dken2021> no, noticed the trees
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT hugs everyone: See ya~
<Tovler> Season 3 has probably already been fully voiced.
<Everlasting_Joy> fillyfillyy I think my response is adequite.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Double Bass
<Dken2021> was that at night?
<fillyfillyy> ok im gonna trace it so i dont ruin the original
<LunaTheBeloved> Banjolin
<StinkomanFan> Guys, I need somepony who speaks latin to tell me if something is grammatorically correct
<Morty> ohai Kirzstryfe
<Randomnerd> And every poltiical hiccup I've seen in the last few years in this country is basically a result of a COMPLETE loss of perspective.
<MahBoi777> it'll look gud, well it already looks good, so maybe better is what I'm trying to say
<Saturn> 8,1your sensor's being saturated, though; if you use a smaller iso, and less exposure time, you can capture star colours better. if you want fainter objects, you can also take many photos and stack them (brighter objects won't be as white and you'll have less sensor noise)
<fillyfillyy> im gonna trace it but i gtg shower 1st ill be back soon
<Saturn> 8,1(note, the stacking method is not what i used on my photo)
<Everlasting_Joy> See you soon fillyfilly *hugs.
<MahBoi777> alright filly
<Randomnerd> fillyfillyy: see ya
*Tovler wonders if decision makers ever consider the worst possible senarios.
<Randomnerd> Unlikely, Tovler :(
<GabeMoist> Well, I need exposure time to get more stars
<GabeMoist> I also used some stacking for that picture
<Saturn> 8,1aye
<unfoundbug> @Tovler, they probably try, but worst case is a very subjective term
<Saturn> 8,1it's a delicate balance
<Tovler> No, gotta think positive. Doubt is the devil afterall. gotta keep faith.
<GabeMoist> Here's a picture someone else did of the same part of the sky
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1tzReAigEo

<StinkomanFan> Alright since I'm being ignored in Mane chat I'm just moving it here
<StinkomanFan> I need somepony to check something for me
<LunaTheBeloved> Sure
<LunaTheBeloved> What?
<LadyCanary> EspyLacopa: OMG. I LOVE her piano/violin covers :D
<Saturn> 8,1wow, that is amazing
<MahBoi777> so this is the PC version of Black Ops correct?
<StinkomanFan> Do you know Latin?
<Saturn> 8,1did you take that?
<LunaTheBeloved> no sorry
<sonicrainboomer259> lol call of duty
<unfoundbug> xbox version
<GabeMoist> I didn't take that
<LunaTheBeloved> Pick somepony else
<GabeMoist> I said someone else did
<Tovler> 2 instruments at the same time?
<KetaminaDianePie> i think is the wii version
<unfoundbug> definately not the pc in any case
<StinkomanFan> Well do you know somepony who does?
<MahBoi777> oh it is? thot there was a pc version
<Saturn> 8,1i'm guessing it was with a bloody good refractor
<GabeMoist> But it is of the same constellation
<unfoundbug> pc looks SOO much better
<LunaTheBeloved> Nope
<LunaTheBeloved> Pick somepony else
<MahBoi777> Battlefield ftw
<Randomnerd> God, I've probably been put on ignore by half the room... sorry, I'm very pedantic.
<StinkomanFan> Well lotta help this turned out to be
<LunaTheBeloved> Sorry :(
<MahBoi777> nonsense mah boi
<MahBoi777> everyone has an opinion

<MahBoi777> mmmm, yes quite
<Randomnerd> I have a calendar counting down the days to BronyCon.
<unfoundbug> youd think this was a pony chat room or somthing
<GabeMoist> The image is a mosaic the guy did. He used several hours of exposure time
<Everlasting_Joy> So who is best pony?
<Randomnerd> It is a pony calendar.
<unfoundbug> rather than a political discussion
<sonicrainboomer259> GIMME THE NEW EPISODE AND HAVE DERPY IN IT,DAMMIT!!!
<TopHat> hello
<Randomnerd> All pony is best pony.
<MahBoi777> Pinkie Pie!

<sonicrainboomer259> sorry
<Randomnerd> I want to make a Space Marine Chapter for Warhammer 40K that loves ponies.
<TopHat> :)
<TopHat> hello
<Reokie> I honestly cant decide :/.
<RawketLawnchair> They'd be heretics.
<RawketLawnchair> Because ponies are xenos
<LunaTheBeloved> SlurryMoon
<Morty> LunaTheBeloved hi im new kinda idrk u
<Randomnerd> Give them all cutie marks on their pauldrons.
<RawketLawnchair> Suffer not the xeno to live, etc.
<sonicrainboomer259> i like caps <3
<Morty> but hi
<Reokie> I guess I have to say RD lol
<LunaTheBeloved> Hi Morty!
<Morty> :3
<Everlasting_Joy> This is wrong. . .
<LunaTheBeloved> I'm LunaTheBeloved
<MahBoi777> Boss tiem
<sonicrainboomer259> omg wario
<Randomnerd> They believe The Emprah rides Celestia into Battle.
<LunaTheBeloved> Most people call me LTB though
<Randomnerd> Hey, if the Imperium can put up with Space Wolves...
<MahBoi777> who's da emprah?
<Morty> hi LTB! yay new friends
<LunaTheBeloved> When did you start coming here?
<SlurryMoon> 3Hai Morty!
<Morty> hi silly
<Morty> sillymoon
<SlurryMoon> 3It's always nice to see new users
<Randomnerd> bad inside joke... in 40K, the God-Emporer of Mankind is the ruler of humans.
<sonicrainboomer259> is everybody seeing what im seeing O_O
<Randomnerd> Emperor*
<Tovler> 30 more minutes until I can sleep
<Morty> im def gonna be a regular
<fillyfillyy> ok all im back and now im gonna copy down my picture to color it
<Morty> i love the brony community
<LunaTheBeloved> That's good
<SlurryMoon> 3:3 yay~
<MahBoi777> yea man, too much all caps equals kick
<LunaTheBeloved> SlurryMoon
<LunaTheBeloved> Yay~
<TopHat> when I came here in the summer, I didn't make friends with anypony
<SlurryMoon> 3x3
<Randomnerd> But because the VAs in the Video Games put on horrible accents, they say "Emprah"
<Reokie> I always wondered, why are there so little male ponies O.o
<Gibby> hello again everyone
<TopHat> I just lurked
<LunaTheBeloved> I slowly gained friends
<Dken2021> hello Gibby
<Randomnerd> The other towns have lots of Male Ponies
<SlurryMoon> 3TopHat I was the same as you, but look at me now
<MahBoi777> hey gibby
<sonicrainboomer259> wario is now 20% cooler
<TopHat> haha ya
<MahBoi777> lol
<Tovler> Flim and Flam made up for the lack of male representation.
<KetaminaDianePie> FOR THE EMPRAH!
<Reokie> And where's the Queen?
<TopHat> I'll never be a mod though
<LunaTheBeloved> You never know
<Reokie> If there was a Princess
<Morty> never say never
<SlurryMoon> 3It's a fun job if you have the time
<TopHat> but I don't want the responsibility
<Morty> except when you say "never say never"
<GabeMoist> Who would the King be?
<Randomnerd> When I used to run with the "Tyrant Celestia" trolls I'd say the Males are fighting wars of conquest, lol.
<Morty> then u can say it twice :P
<unfoundbug> but to get from princess to queen, she would have to marry a prince
<kirzstryfe> 1,3yeah, we feed him, and water him, and let him out to play 3 times a day
<Dken2021> simple, queen = evil, princess = good
<sonicrainboomer259> is it RD playin this?!
<LunaTheBeloved> I rather like being a resident
<MahBoi777> ohai filly
<unfoundbug> i dont think anypony s good enough for celstia
<Reokie> Randomnerd: omg that makes so mcuh sence
<sonicrainboomer259> wtf
<Morty> i have tons of time on my hands, doing nothing until september
<RawketLawnchair> I just
<GabeMoist> infoundbug, or lives long enough
<Tovler> >mfw I think of Trolestia/Molestia before I think of canon Princess Celestia
<RawketLawnchair> I feel sad.
<RawketLawnchair> I don't know why. I just do.
<SlurryMoon> 3Well, maybe you should try to be a mod when we start accepting applications again
<LadyCanary> Something on your mind?
<Morty> cept hanging here, being with gf and writing
<Morty> ok maybe ^-^
<Reokie> That would make the most sence too, and Celestia is keeping the rest of the population ignorant of the ongoing wars
<Everlasting_Joy> 1984 all over again.
<Randomnerd> There's little implication there's a war on in Equestria. It could also be universal male Conscription.
*Flaria huggles LadyCanary
*LadyCanary hugs Flaria back
<TopHat> do you get payed? lol
<LunaTheBeloved> Back in my days as a young resident.....
<RawketLawnchair> Something on my mind?
<RawketLawnchair> Well, there's quite a lot.
<sonicrainboomer259> am i the only person who wants saturday to come
<unfoundbug> it could just be genetically males are less viable than females
<RawketLawnchair> But this isn't my blog. So I'll spare you my woes.
<Randomnerd> Basically, the fellas are watching the border.
<Tovler> Maybe the males all died in the war
<unfoundbug> then why wasnt macintosh there
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol, paid
<kirzstryfe> 1,3nope
<Dken2021> maybe he was too young for war?
<LunaTheBeloved> Paid. That's a good on---Wait do you?
<Randomnerd> Maybe he finished his tour.
<sonicrainboomer259> good lol
<Tovler> Draft dodger
<RawketLawnchair> Macintosh suffers from PTSD, and doesn't talk a whole lot because of it.
<TopHat> explain why theres so many young fillies
<SlurryMoon> 3No, no, you don't get paid
<RawketLawnchair> Hurr hurr.
<Dken2021> or inb4 it's a show about silly ponies, no need to go deeper than that
<Randomnerd> This is all headcanon, mind.
<unfoundbug> eeeyup
<SlurryMoon> 3That is unless you guys donate to us
<LunaTheBeloved> I like being a resident
<kirzstryfe> 1,3not that Slurry knows at least :3

<BronyCon> Does anyone here recomend Hawx 1?
<SlurryMoon> 3Suddenly Luna
<LunaTheBeloved> To a girl named Juliet....
<sonicrainboomer259> rayman
<Randomnerd> World-building is fun, but to be honest, the "Conscription" Theory isn't internally consistent.
<unfoundbug> Suddenly rare names
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hehe
<MirrorImage> BronyCon - you mean the fighter jets game?
<unfoundbug> I got it on xbox, i really enjoyed Hawx
<BronyCon> yes
<Randomnerd> We know what Pony War looks like -they shoot pies.
<MirrorImage> it's alright
<BronyCon> Um
<LunaTheBeloved> There it will be used to further the Brony Communtiy
<BronyCon> Pc?
<sonicrainboomer259> put black ops on):
<unfoundbug> as long as you get custom soundtracks going
<kirzstryfe> 1,3the 6 rooms are just different chat channels, there's only one stream
<MirrorImage> i had it for PS3
<Morty> hi Luna

<Morty> :>
<LunaTheBeloved> Ohai Lulu
<BronyCon> lol unfound
*RainbowDash noms on zapapple
<unfoundbug> the bombing runs are a bit dull
<BronyCon> Yeah
<Randomnerd> Mr. and Mrs. Cake are defense contractors, if "Over a Barrel" is any indication.
<unfoundbug> but if you ignore the auto targeting and dog fight in jets
<Everlasting_Joy> Hahaha
<unfoundbug> its REALLY fun
<Lulu> 07,01hello everypony
<sonicrainboomer259> i was jokin
<MirrorImage> Randomnerd - how do you gather that from Over a Barrel?
<LunaTheBeloved> Quick Question Lulu......everytime somepony says my name, do you get pinged?
<BronyCon> How's the cockpit and controls?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:p
<Randomnerd> Ponies fight Buffalo with Pie.
<unfoundbug> only played xbox
<unfoundbug> but felt pretty solid
<Lulu> 07,01not in mIRC but yea if i'm logged in via the web...I get pinged
<BronyCon> ah
<Dken2021> maybe their "catering" business is secretly a ammunition store
<BronyCon> ok
<BronyCon> thanks
<Morty> not if they type your whole name
<sonicrainboomer259> was raqyman humpin the air?
<LunaTheBeloved> Oh......

<BronyCon> YAAAY
<otakon|AFK> what's up my bronies?
<unfoundbug> the camera was pretty nice as well, multiple modes was cool
<Dken2021> hiyo otakon

<Randomnerd> nm, good to see ya, otakon
<LunaTheBeloved> I'm sorry if that gets annoying....
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy otakon|AFK.
<GabeMoist> Luna was banished to the Moon for opposing the war efforts
<RainbowDash> otakon: wuz up?
<KetaminaDianePie> Stay tuned! Coming up next Sonic Generations!
<otakon> not much
<sonicrainboomer259> :P6_9
<kirzstryfe> 1,3very few people type out LunaTheBeloved
<SlurryMoon> 3The pings have been Doubled!
<otakon> I like that jingle
<Randomnerd> Actually, I find it more dreadful to think that Celestia made a horrible mistake.
<Lulu> 07,01it's alright
*Tovler dreams Equestria
<sonicrainboomer259> fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.
<Yahooz> ...
<Hat> Luna wouldn't have gotten out if it weren't for her escape effort
<sonicrainboomer259> ck
<Yahooz> RayMan?
<TopHat> type out?
<Randomnerd> Not that she was oppressing ponies, and banished Luna for her defiance.
<TopHat> what about tab
<LunaTheBeloved> If you'ld like me to change my name I will.
<Tovler> Dude, I love Rayman
*RainbowDash glomps LunaTheBeloved
<LunaTheBeloved> You did have the name first
*LunaTheBeloved is glomped
<LunaTheBeloved> Hi there :3
<kirzstryfe> 1,3we tried that out before LunaTheBeloved, you were unhappy for a week before you changed back
*Phase4 has a new irl friend
<Randomnerd> But that Luna did a bad thing, and in her inexperience and anger, Celestia Banished her own Flesh-and-Blood to the moon... because even grown-ups make mistakes kids.
<SlurryMoon> 3Oh LunaTheBeloved, you don't have to do that
<sonicrainboomer259> how come were the only ones talkin
<Everlasting_Joy> Phase4 if only some of us were so lucky ;).
<MirrorImage> Randomnerd - it was Time Out, plain and simple
<unfoundbug> 1000 time out
<MirrorImage> just a matter of scale
<Tovler> I used to have real-life friends, like you.
<LunaTheBeloved> If it annoys her I can, I really don't mind
<sonicrainboomer259> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSS SONIC!!!!!!

<Phase4> Everlasting_Joy: well to be fair i was more or less forced to talk to him
<LadyCanary> Or to the SQUEE.
<otakon> that's a better one
<Everlasting_Joy> Phase4 fair enough.
<otakon> hiya LadyCanary
<GabeMoist> Took a squee to the knee

<Phase4> KetaminaDianePie: why are you crying/
<Randomnerd> MirrorImage: Eeyup
<MirrorImage> i think the embarrasment in that scene was less "i'm naked. oh wait" as much as it was "why am i covering up in the first place?"
<sonicrainboomer259> 1yay black ops 2.no all caps
<otakon> hmm

<Tovler> Man, that was one of the best episodes of Adventure Time ever.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3but if you play House, it's almost to the kutner/bad episode isn't it?
<prince-dari> Hey Yahooz
<RainbowDash> "I'm the world champ, you know. I bet you can't beat me! *SQUEE*...Aaahhhhhh...."

<GarrettBrony> Yahooz mah boi great to see you
<prince-dari> Yeah?
<Lulu> 07,01yep
<otakon> isn't there a part of England called Wales?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Tovler> Sumica's still rubbing elbows with the high-rollers
<RainbowDash> :(
<prince-dari> Wales is a different country.
<prince-dari> :P
<Lulu> 07,01should try to stream at least 1 or maybe 2 eps tomorrow
<otakon> :/
<Tovler> Wales and Eng… yeah
<Yahooz> Duh
<unfoundbug> @otakon, be VERy careful where you say that
<Yahooz> You didnt know that?
<otakon> :P
<Everlasting_Joy> RainbowDash be sad no longer, I bet thee.
<otakon> I did
<prince-dari> You would get raged at by Welsh people for saying.
<otakon> I was just messin
<prince-dari> And raged at by English people.
<prince-dari> :P
<unfoundbug> alot of people in both countries dont like being associated with theother
<Everlasting_Joy> *I beseech thee.
<prince-dari> Just generally raged at
<otakon> ooooh
<Phase4> welsh? i;ma google that
<RainbowDash> Everlasting_Joy: :P
<otakon> raged at by the english
<Tovler> It's like calling a Texan a yankee. You just don't do that.
<NullRadix> Welsh is for grape juice?
<otakon> scary~
<GarrettBrony> @prince-dari r u streaming
<prince-dari> Nope
<GarrettBrony> whois
<unfoundbug> a general rule of thumb, everyone hates everyone unless there is someone that lives further away
<sonicrainboomer259> how 6_9
<Everlasting_Joy> RainbowDash why I went with a middle English line? Because sometimes I do.
<Yahooz> Its like using the term British, it refers to Engalnd, Wales, and Scottland
<unfoundbug> or a brony
<KetaminaDianePie> Or like calling a souther italian terrone
<KetaminaDianePie> haha:D!
<MirrorImage> prince-dari - you really need to fix that script
<Dken2021> no one's streaming, it's on loop
<GarrettBrony> noooooooooo
<prince-dari> Just as Andy Murray is British if he wins, and Scottish if he loses.
<unfoundbug> @yahooz, may not be the case soon, scotland is trying for independance
<prince-dari> Just recently he was Scottish.
<Yahooz> XD
<RainbowDash> It's okay. My mom goes to alot of Renaissance fairs so she speaks that way smoetimes. Thank Thee...
<prince-dari> :P
<Tovler> I love how the Bristish destroy their dogs instead of putting them down.

<Phase4> what is what? i turned my stream off
<sonicrainboomer259> their only showin eps on friday,and saturday
<Tovler> F'real. They use the word "destroy" for putting down animals. It's hilarious

<sonicrainboomer259> and i got school:/
<RainbowDash> 6_9
<KetaminaDianePie> i was talking about the link
<MirrorImage> the 6 message/10 seconds kick script
<prince-dari> It doesn't need fixing
<Shizuka> 13it does its job well
<otakon> I think it does
<MirrorImage> either that message is horribly inaccurate or your criteria is off
<kirzstryfe> 1,3non-pony stuff
<Phase4> KetaminaDianePie: oh, it does a 302 or 303 (not sure which) when you go to it
<Phase4> KetaminaDianePie: redirects you to another page
<sonicrainboomer259> btw what game is this6_9
<prince-dari> It's because of lag between me and the person sending the message.
<Tovler> 10 seconds is awefully long with you think about it.
<RainbowDash> I got to get to bed now, guys. sry i was only here for a short time. I'll be on here tomorrow..BYE!:)
<prince-dari> And either way, it works fine.
<KetaminaDianePie> ooowww

<Randomnerd> Taaaaab!
<Phase4> prince-dari: so it wasnt just me, it does kick on less than 6/10 due to lag
<otakon> does not
<GarrettBrony> lets make sopa a curse word
<Lulu> 07,01other series
<unfoundbug> actually, looking at the time, i'm gonna be heading off as well, in lectures in 6 hours
<Lulu> 07,01such as magic school bus
<Lulu> 07,01animaniacs
<otakon> I've been kicked on 4 messages I swear
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol
<prince-dari> It may be less than 6/10 on your side, but not on mine.

<MirrorImage> and i've seen people kicked on 2/11
<Everlasting_Joy> Night RainbowDash.
<TopHat> nope
<Shizuka> 13Morty: [20:57] *** Morty [yukcfymcbg@h-28-180-678-03.hsd8.ma.comcast.net] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
<Shizuka> 13you closed your client
<otakon> argh
<prince-dari> MirrorImage: You're wrong there
<Randomnerd> When we were singing along to Megas XLR, I got kicked, I'm not mad, I'm actually proud I could type that fast, lol.
<otakon> I need to figure out how to use auto join script
<KetaminaDianePie> so you can troll with images or videos and nobody knows Phase4?
*Tovler now has Skype but is too chicken to use it.
<Randomnerd> I've been much more careful since then.
<Shizuka> 13well you won't without a real client otakun~
<sonicrainboomer259> 1 FUCK that stuff 2 how do i watch that stuff?wait for it to com on?
<otakon> Tovler: don't be afraid
<otakon> well crap
<MirrorImage> prince-dari - maybe it was just personal time stamps, but what's apparent is that your script seems to get a lot of apparent false-positives
<Phase4> KetaminaDianePie: its intended for shorting urls, but i supose you can
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I can safely say that Giant Rad Scorpions are the scariest jerks in Fallout. Serioulsy, screw those guys
<xcanox> "Connection reset by peer" doesn't mean a client quit.
<KetaminaDianePie> http://derpy.me/XpqUXAJ3IDk
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Anyway, what I miss?
<Shizuka> 13Randomnerd: pff, i sang along the first night of Blazing Saddles... nopony noticed just how hard it was to type that fast, und then daribot smacked me anyway :<
<TopHat> oh, I thought that was it's main purpose
<SkilledSkillet> Im back
<Everlasting_Joy> Well howdy Scoot-Scootaloo.
<xcanox> Typically, it means there was a communication error.
<KetaminaDianePie> hmmmmmmm
<GarrettBrony> +Saturn sup still in scootland
<prince-dari> As I said, only possible discrepancies are lag time between me and the person
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy SkilledSkillet.
<Randomnerd> lol Shizuka
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Howdy!
<sonicrainboomer259> now i know its nights:$
<KetaminaDianePie> ow
<KetaminaDianePie> i get it
<otakon> 1
<otakon> 2
<otakon> 3
<otakon> 4
<otakon> 5
<xcanox> "Connection reset by peer" is the TCP/IP equivelant to slamming the phone back on the hook.
<Shizuka> 13aaaaaaand
<Phase4> KetaminaDianePie: invalid link, you need to go to http://derpy.me to generate one
<otakon> nope
<sonicrainboomer259> BLACK OPS
<KetaminaDianePie> i get it i get it
<otakon> just a test is all
<Shizuka> 13uh huh
<sonicrainboomer259> derp
<Phase4> confound that flashplugin
<Phase4> slowing down my pc and derping my chat
<otakon> well
<otakon> clear your cache!
<GarrettBrony> I need a heeping dose of either ponies or anime
<otakon> run Ccleaner
<otakon> GarrettBrony: I suggest One Piece
<prince-dari> MirrorImage: I can even go to my lags and find ever single instance of people kicked by the script
<otakon> or Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
<Shizuka> 13well.. so could i...
<prince-dari> logs*
<GarrettBrony> Otakon Which One Piece
<Tovler> I suggest Gintama
<TopHat> hm...
<Shizuka> 13grep "you sent 6 messages in 10 seconds"
<otakon> GarrettBrony: the good one i.e. Funimation's
<otakon> here I have a link hold on
<TopHat> Could we use quantum jumping to get to Equestria?
<sonicrainboomer259> leavin
<AppleDash> I seem to be having connection issues that seem to be on the server's end.
<TopHat> I have a link: http://derpy.me/VVXnL
<Morty> Tophat: I hope so
<otakon> http://www1.watchop.com/
<MirrorImage> that's fine dari, maybe i'm just fully understanding how IRC works compared to other chat protocols

<fluttercry> 05,15Well I'm going for the night. Later my people!
<otakon> I'm not using it
<MirrorImage> but perhaps you need to loosen the criteria on that filter then to help fix it - 8/15 perhaps?
<Nittany_Discord> .
<AppleDash> I believe it was rainbowdash
<MirrorImage> or 8/10
<otakon> night fluttercry sleep well
<Dken2021> night fluttercry

<Phase4> LordCelestia: part 5?
<Shizuka> 13http://imgur.com/a/xg4fj
<LordCelestia> 0,5Yep
<AppleDash> Sometimes I just leave and minimize mIRC while still connected
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Seriously though, I don't think I'll sleep tonight...
<AppleDash> And I come back, there has not been a chat msg for over 10 minutes
<Morty> y?
<AppleDash> I type a command, such as .join or .identify
<AppleDash> err
<AppleDash> /join or /identify
<Tovler> (OMG, this movie is boring! I h8 black history month!)
<Phase4> lol, dat season 2

<LunaTheBeloved> Oh....
<SaxyPretender> 0,14(\ Flaria
<MirrorImage> you'll be walking along, and all of a sudden you'll take a random Varmint Rifle to the face
<Scoot-Scootaloo> MirrorImages D:
<LadyCanary> I take it you're enjoying it, Saxy
<Kabaka> All right
<SaxyPretender> 0,14eeyup
<AppleDash> It happens so often that when it does reconnect, I forget to identify, thus the need for typing /identify
<KetaminaDianePie> SOUL CALIBUR?!?!?!
<Kabaka> I see two "connection reset by peer" quits
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01K
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I get scared so easily :(
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dat...dari bot
<AppleDash> That must be it.
<MirrorImage> worse yet are the raiders who use Grenade Rifles as a primary weapon...
<Kabaka> That is not on our end.
<AppleDash> It happens at least once daily.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3so how long do you think we can slack off in here before anypony notices we're here?
<AppleDash> What is it?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14a long time
<SaxyPretender> 0,14?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I just fought one! They came up to me from behind!
<MirrorImage> though if you encounter them in the right way, they can also be hilarious
<Shizuka> 13foreverr
*Morty wubs Scoot-Scootaloo
<MirrorImage> i saw one blow himself and 3 of his comrades up as i went to charge them with a combat knife
<Dken2021> ok, an odd movie synopsis
<LordCelestia> 0,5http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/art/A-New-World-Equestria-Part-5-282628559
<Scoot-Scootaloo> "Hey buddy, can I get some wa-NADE LAUNCHER TO THE FACE!'
<MirrorImage> the grenade didn't even explode near me
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Forever's a long time
<Randomnerd> There is not enough Fluttershy!
<KetaminaDianePie> omg i totally forgot about Soul Calibur V
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's like...forever, man
<LunaTheBeloved> And this chat room dies..........
<Kabaka> The socket is being ungracefully closed somewhere on your end. Either your client is closing it without sending a QUIT command or something else is closing it for some reason.
<AppleDash> Like I said, another network I'm on in the same mIRC at the same time dows not do that
<MirrorImage> and as another tip Scoot-Scootaloo - you'll want to become VERY good at Caravan
<otakon> yeah
<AppleDash> does*
<kirzstryfe> 1,3duuuuuude
<otakon> another Soul Caliber
*Morty defribulates the chat
<RawketLawnchair> No streams?
<LadyCanary> Nope
<otakon> I wonder if Namco still has busoms on the brain...
<Lulu> 07,01nope
<Phase4> damnit, i keep loosing this tab
*Lulu hugs everypony
<Kabaka> I see tons of ping timeouts over the last few days.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,013 nights. Coming in with no stream.
<Morty> yay
*LunaTheBeloved hugs back
<MirrorImage> i ended up walking in to the Nipton store with about 2500 caps and managed to walk out with a Chainsaw (2700 caps), a damage mod for it (2500 caps), and a further 6000 caps in spare change
<SaxyPretender> 0,14they do, but nowhere near as bad as SC4
<Scoot-Scootaloo> You know, I never really knew how to play Caravan. I still don't get it!
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: well your a MOD you can change that!
<MidgetBrony> I know I do
<MidgetBrony> but I blame my ed
<Lulu> 07,01Sorry was playing with Lanie :)
*kirzstryfe noms on defribulated chat
*SlurryMoon explodes into confetti
<AppleDash> That is quite odd... I don't NOTICE pinging out ever.
<Dken2021> he's just a hop
<Kabaka> That means our server is sending your client a PING command and it is not replying within 250 seconds.
<Morty> in my fanfic, should fluttershy say noooo or nyuuuuu
<LadyCanary> A skip!
<Kabaka> I see about 15 per day for you
<GarrettBrony> otakon thankyou for the suggestion
<MirrorImage> want me to give you a quick primer on it scoot?
<AppleDash> You have a large ping timeout time
<MidgetBrony> Who?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm a half-op. I don't have the reigns of the main stream yet.
<KetaminaDianePie> well...... at least is a new fighting game to play with my friends otakon
<Kabaka> AppleDash
*LunaTheBeloved watches a pony noms, one explodes and another hugs
<MidgetBrony> Ahhhh
<kirzstryfe> 1,3depends on the situation
<Shizuka> 13reins
<MidgetBrony> I thought you meant me
<MidgetBrony> D:
<LunaTheBeloved> *nom
<AppleDash> My other server only does about 25 seconds before timeout
<Kabaka> You weren't asking for help. :-\
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know.
<Morty> Twilight is grabbing her to teleport
<AppleDash> oops
<MidgetBrony> Of course im not
<AppleDash> wrong windows
<otakon> SaxyPretender: tbh I don't mind cheesecake. But it did seem like all the females had a ....well "bountiful" set of endowments
<Shizuka> 13also today you learned it's "free rein" not "free reign" cause reign implies you can already do whatever you want
<Morty> to a pony that hit on her
*kirzstryfe noms LunaTheBeloved while hugging her, then promptly explodes
<Phase4> DAMNIT i lost it again
<Kabaka> Anyway, it looks like your client is not correctly answering pings. That is probably the main problem.
<otakon> you lost
<otakon> the game?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14indeed, otakon, I often joked that plastic surgery existed in the 16th century
<GarrettBrony> whose up for cider
<Phase4> NO, this tab
<otakon> lol
<Phase4> but that too
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01it is reins
<AppleDash> What could be causing that on my end?
*LunaTheBeloved is hugged,nommed then blasted with confetti into the wall
<kirzstryfe> 1,3in the story, is she really not interested, or feigning disinterest because of her personality?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Giggle at the Scorpions! Guffaw at the Ant-ies!
<LunaTheBeloved> Ouch
<fillyfillyy> to everyone who wanted me to color my Pinkie Pie picture http://derpy.me/e3xxH
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's what I get for napping. Getting stupid.
*SlurryMoon hugs LunaTheBeloved x3
<Kabaka> I'm not seeing frequent timeouts from other users, so I don't think it is server-side (and our automatic diagnostics would have reported this)
<kirzstryfe> 1,3<3
*LunaTheBeloved hugs SlurryMoon
<Phase4> so many derpy.me links
<MirrorImage> Crack up at the *WARGHL-GHOUL*
<otakon> fillyfillyy: next time dear, use a smooth surface
<Kabaka> Client misconfiguration, firewalls, ISP trouble, bad network hardware
<MirrorImage> (btw, have fun with the Ghouls - they like to ambush)
<Kabaka> Misconfiguration is most likely
<otakon> yeah
<fillyfillyy> lol i know i dont have one :D
*LunaTheBeloved promptly noms kirzstryfe's tail in respnose
<otakon> fillyfillyy: you don't have a smooth table or floor to use?
*kirzstryfe puts giraffes in the air
<GarrettBrony> Fellow bronys look up the song Party by boston/ It is a great song for a pinkie pmv
<AppleDash> I've used mIRC for 5 years and know quite a bit... But, for the fun of it, what could be misconfigured?
<Kabaka> A cheap fix to this is normally to have your client send server pings every now and then. Most can be configured to do that.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I haven't gotten up to the part where I fight ghouls, and I'm scared D:
<Morty> Kirzstryfe: She just kinda fainted of embarrassment after he sweet talked her
<fillyfillyy> not in my room right now my desk is all scratched up
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: don't be, there's WORSE!
<Morty> she is indifferent/embarrased
<otakon> fillyfillyy: hmmm
<otakon> use a textbook
<LadyCanary> Scoot-Scootaloo: Has Pinkie Pie taught you NOTHING?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3do you plan on her getting involved with said pony?
<fillyfillyy> ok
<Morty> no
<fillyfillyy> but how is it?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I played Fallout 3, so i knda know what to expect, I hope D:
<TopHat> he has a gf!
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: wait until you meet the Deathclaws
<Morty> ?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3then I'd go with a regular noooooooo
<SkilledSkillet> deathclaws are awful otakon
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I fought a young Deathclaw! It destrolished me!
<MirrorImage> otakon - why wait? just take the shortcut north to New Vegas from Goodsprings
<Morty> that was my gut feeling
<kirzstryfe> 1,3nyuuuu sounds more like she'd want to go, but felt she had to fight it
<AppleDash> And how do I do that? I've never heard of that option in mIRC
<TopHat> what are we talking about anyway
<Morty> but Fluttershy saying nyuuuu=me want :3
<MirrorImage> it's completely plausible to defeat Deathclaws at level 3
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Pinkie Pie never saw a giant Scorpion!
<GarrettBrony> Scoot-Scootaloo when you meet the Deathclaws you can kill them and make a deathclaw guantlet
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Morty's writing a story
<otakon> fillyfillyy: yeah, just but the textbook under the part your coloring is all, and don't forget it helps to color in the same direction, helps it look uniform
<TopHat> oh

<Kabaka> Huh. Well, my next best thought is that you should try connecting to a server that isn't so distant. You may want to try irc.us.ponychat.net, or look at the map on http://ponychat.net/server-information/ and choose a server closer to you.

*Randomnerd is now oribiting the glomp pile
<RawketLawnchair> Full screen chat.
<Kabaka> I would try that, and it it doesn't seem to solve the problem, we can look for other causes. I'm doing some network tests from Rarity to your location, and there doesn't seem to be any connectivity problems, but overseas connections are more prone to problems like this.

<VioletVanilla> 06Stallion_of_War~
<MakerDusk> hello Phase4
*VioletVanilla hugs everypony~
<AppleDash> I thought simply connecting to iris.ponychat.net would shift me over to the closest server.
<LunaTheBeloved> Hi Violet~
<MakerDusk> hello Shizuka
<Everlasting_Joy> <3.
<Shizuka> 13i... i have never hugged an ircop before...
<SkilledSkillet> Gutentag Violet
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 08,05Guys, I hope you don't mind if I test out certain colors. Will that be okay?
<TopHat> Was I automatically added here because I am a regular?
<Saturn> 8,1who's an IRCop?
<Phase4> no, again i derped the link
<RawketLawnchair> Woah.
<Kabaka> iris.ponychat.net will connect you to one of our Iris web chat servers.
<Stallion_of_War> Scoot- Of all the things that could happen, that would be
<Stallion_of_War> THE
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol
<Stallion_of_War> WORST
<RawketLawnchair> Those are some funky colors.
<Stallion_of_War> POSSIBLE
<Phase4> hacked mine to autojoin here
<Stallion_of_War> THING!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Saturn pays attention :3
<Midnight_Tempest> O.O bright text is BRIGHT!
<Saturn> 8,1Scoot-Scootaloo: maybe it'd be wiser to do that in another channel?
<RawketLawnchair> Looks like. .. spaghetti-os.
<Kabaka> That address is meant to be put into a web browser, not an IRC client.
<TopHat> oh...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 01,05yeah, ill do that
<TopHat> :(
<MakerDusk> no one's an ircop
<Kabaka> See http://ponychat.net/server-information/ for a list of host names you should use in your client.
<Phase4> but your probably regular enough to be here anyway
<MakerDusk> this network has none
*Phase4 hugs TopHat
<Lulu> 07,01ah
<TopHat> good
<TopHat> :)
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hehe
<Lulu> 07,01so I can allow my bots to enter?
<RawketLawnchair> Woah, dark and edgy colors.
<AppleDash> Ehh
<Kabaka> We don't currently have a geographically-aware host name you can use, which is why we have irc.us.ponychat.net and irc.eu.ponychat.net for regional pools.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Scoot-Scootaloo. Colors!
<MakerDusk> Lulu: you can try
<Stallion_of_War> What color does Wrek use again?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dark red.
<Stallion_of_War> Red on black?
<Kabaka> In your case, fluttershy.ponychat.net is probably the best choice.
<Phase4> MakerDusk: do you keep logs of of this room?
<AppleDash> I was using the web client
<Saturn> 8,1MakerDusk: aha, i see what you did there :P
<AppleDash> And I asked what I should put into mIRC
<otakon> hiya Lulu
<AppleDash> And they said iris.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Shizu does
<Everlasting_Joy> If we're going to be using colors in our text. . . I'll be back shortly. Muahahahahaha.

<Shizuka> 13Phase4: IRC can be used to transfer files
<VioletVanilla> 06bronystate silly~
<kirzstryfe> 1,3^
<Midnight_Tempest> its like the spectrum exploded in this chat
<Phase4> ah, thought that might be it

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 02,07What is this place filled woth so many wonders~
<Stallion_of_War> und all the bunnies! Buuuuuuuuu nieeeeeeesssss!
<AppleDash> I switched to using irc.ponychat.net instead of iris.ponychat.net.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01First time I used IRC was to transfer files.
<Shizuka> 13vivi where am i... this is a place filled with... not enough snuggles...
<Phase4> xchat had a file transfer option
<KetaminaDianePie> O.O
<Kabaka> Incidentally, that put you on Rarity again :-P
<Everlasting_Joy> Midnight_Tempest someone set off a sonic rainboom.
<KetaminaDianePie> O.@
*Spectrum exploded in this chat

<LadyCanary> Casting its spell that I am now under~
<Phase4> oh look, another alternative to megaupload, irc!

<LadyCanary> :3
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka *hugs?
<Stallion_of_War> Vivi - No, but I'd like to hear it. I wasn't aware you had done one. I bet it's awesome
*VioletVanilla snuggles Shizuka
<Kabaka> We considered that, but decided it would be bad luck; the server itself might end up being derpy and unreliable.
<MakerDusk> Phase4: yes it does, and it's of course allowed on the network... for banned book purposes
*Steven_Magnet 1 2 3 4
*Shizuka 13hides under vivi's mane from exploding chat
<MidgetBrony> Well we were going to have vinyl....

<BewareOfBunny> hallooo
<Kabaka> Well, I notice you identify manually after connecting. It is possible, using some of the methods listed there, to automatically identify during connection, such as by using your services password as the server password. And with SASL or CertFP, your password is not transmitted (though I think you need a script for mIRC for those).
<Stallion_of_War> Did anypony else think of the witch from L4D2 when Fluttershy mentioned being startled?
<Yahooz> Yazooooo?

<Midnight_Tempest> they really need more selection for onlive... the games are pretty lacking
<Dken2021> becasue having new content in the middle of the week would be weird. look at CN, used to show them on fridays, not they do it mondays

<StickySyrup> hahahahha
<Dken2021> night Shizuschlafen
<Phase4> Ingwaz|laptop, well it was on the stream
<Phase4> suddenly twi
<Davie_Jones> Blah
<Phase4> twilight is best pony
<Dken2021> I see them socks
<Phase4> she needs more episode
<Ingwaz|laptop> well...i'm not making much progress on my homework, so i think i'll sleep for a bit then try again
<Ingwaz|laptop> Phase4: shes in like every single episode
<Ingwaz|laptop> if anybody needs more episodes its rarity and applejack
<Phase4> but so is derpy, with about the same amount of screentime
<Davie_Jones> I think Phase is trollen
<StickySyrup> I think twilight needs a new episode for herself
<Ingwaz|laptop> he could be, or he got applebucked in the head by applejack
<Davie_Jones> We already had Lesson Zero
<Phase4> rarity and applejack got their episodes, cept for "lesson 0" we havent had a real twilight episode
<Dken2021> now that you think, she really doesn't have that much
<Davie_Jones> Winter Wrap up
<Phase4> true
<StickySyrup> but then again, she is the central character
<Phase4> she did get winter wrap up
<Ingwaz|laptop> she doesnt have a ton of episodes strictly devoted to her, but not any of the other mane 6 do either
<Ingwaz|laptop> its usually a combination episode
<StickySyrup> its because she is usually involved in all the episodes
<Phase4> not this season though
<StickySyrup> SuperBrony64: have any good music? I cant be bothered to open itunes
<Dken2021> in season 1 she was there mostly for filling the letter out
<Phase4> lesson zero was the only episode where we had real character development
<Ingwaz|laptop> meh, i could look up episodes and debate it with you Phase4, but i really shoudl sleep for a bit
<StickySyrup> good episode though
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I can put something on...
<StickySyrup> Ingwaz|laptop: Bronys shall overcome the need to sleep
<Davie_Jones> The show is about friendships, you can't have Twilight by herself and not building friendships
<Ingwaz|laptop> lesson zero was insanity development, not sure if i'd call it character development
<Phase4> Ingwaz|laptop, yeah, sleep is good
<StickySyrup> SuperBrony64: Thanks :)
<Phase4> lesson zero was good but not my favorite
<StickySyrup> same... I really liked winter wrap up
<Ingwaz|laptop> StickySyrup: considering its 03:30, i plan on sleeping for only a few hours, attending a full day at college and donating plasma afterwards, i need sleep
<StickySyrup> tuuunnneeee
<Ingwaz|laptop> oh sb, you such a troll
<Phase4> nittany discord left and gave us all hugs
<Phase4> dat fml
<StickySyrup> Ingwaz|laptop: hehe have a good... um... morning then
<Davie_Jones> The first two episodes of any season should count was Twilight Episodes.
<Phase4> i count them as group episodes
<Ingwaz|laptop> no, fist two this season were discord eps
<Ingwaz|laptop> and i loved them
<Phase4> ohai StickySyrup
<StickySyrup> lol... I clicked the screen... sorry
<Davie_Jones> Oh really, Phase? Who was the one who brought together five opposites into one group?
<Phase4> lol
<Ingwaz|laptop> nn everypony
<Phase4> night Ingwaz|laptop
*SuperBrony64 hugs Ingwaz|laptop
<Dken2021> nighty night ingwaz
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Night ^_^
<StickySyrup> Anyone heard the Hush now Quiet now remix by princess addictia?
<Phase4> Davie_Jones, honestly? they allready seemed to be friends before twi showed up
<Davie_Jones> Who was the one that Celestia sent to awaken the Elements of Harmony?
<StickySyrup> night Ingwaz|laptop
<Phase4> twi was simply common ground
<Davie_Jones> Who was the one who figured out what the 'Spark' was?
<StickySyrup> thats Twilight
<Phase4> nah, realy?
<Davie_Jones> Who brought all the ponies back when they feel into Chaos?
<Phase4> am i still recording?
<StickySyrup> I need to watch all episodes again... for the 4th time
<Phase4> i am still recording
<Phase4> 300mb of near lossless footage
<Phase4> 1 hour
<StickySyrup> recording what?
<Dken2021> how do you not notice?
<StickySyrup> oh
<Phase4> stream and chat
<Phase4> ariscop, ding
<StickySyrup> HELLO Phase4's recording!!
<Davie_Jones> Then there's Ticket Master...
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Who wants to hear A BronyState Christmas Special?
<StickySyrup> has anyone heard the Hush now quiet now remix by Princess addictia
<Davie_Jones> Boast Busters
<Dken2021> sure
<StickySyrup> SuperBrony64: ok =) those were the days before I was a Brony
<Davie_Jones> Bridle Gossep
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:3
<StickySyrup> Let me dim the lights....
<Phase4> but they've all been group episodes. wich is apropirate for twi sure but still
<Phase4> we dont have a 'baby cakes' for twi
<Phase4> wow, that was not a sentence i would have ever imagined me saying
<StickySyrup> lol.... wish I was a Brony sooner
<Davie_Jones> There, I can count at least 6 Twilight centered episodes
<Davie_Jones> And I call them that because for at least 50% percent of the time, the camera is focused on a scene were Twilight is at and is actively partaking in.
<Phase4> i'l give you boast busters, but the rest are more about the interaction of twi with her friends
<Davie_Jones> I mean, for the first one the camera rarely left her.
<StickySyrup> Phase4: why are you recording?
<Phase4> StickySyrup, testing before the next episode
<Davie_Jones> Same for Winter Wrap Up
<Phase4> @pony
<Phase4> hmm, steve is broke

<Davie_Jones> you are free to think that.

*SuperBrony64 hugs StickySyrup

<Dken2021> @calc 2+4
<Steven_Magnet> 6 2+4 = 6
<Davie_Jones> What about between Season One and Two? They changed directors.
<StickySyrup> @calc 234+465
<Steven_Magnet> 6 234+465 = 699
<StickySyrup> sweeet
<Dken2021> @calc 1/0
<Steven_Magnet> 4,8I can't let you do that Dken2021
<Phase4> xD
<StickySyrup> lol :P
<Dken2021> @brokemeter Steven_Magnet
<Phase4> Davie_Jones, there was a large change from group episodes with minor continuity to individual episodes, but that seems more like experimenting than change in method
<Dken2021> @lovemeter Dken2021
<StickySyrup> Not much changed really
<Davie_Jones> How so?
<Davie_Jones> experimenting in what way?
<StickySyrup> @lovemeter
<StickySyrup> nooooo
<Dken2021> @lovemeter Dken2021
<StickySyrup> did it tell you to shutup too?
<Phase4> Davie_Jones, ticket master introduced the gala wich was a recuring theme for the rest of the season
<Davie_Jones> Yes, that was the overarching plot
<Dken2021> I think he's beyond repair with all the spam he had to report
<Phase4> most episodes involved the entire mane 6
<StickySyrup> does anyone else have Brony music on their Ipod, and balst it loud!?!
<StickySyrup> lol IM NOT GAY
<Dken2021> what's with val and tridents?
<Davie_Jones> Amy Keathing Rogers must be a close friend of Lauren Faust.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02'I'M NOT GAY'
<StickySyrup> was that you?
<Dken2021> that was val
<Phase4> http://derpy.me/sRsMn this is a real thing that exists, and is by the same writers?
<Davie_Jones> WOAH! Lauren has red hair.
<Phase4> writer'
<Phase4> i must see this movie
<StickySyrup> red hair FTW
<Davie_Jones> Yes, that is a real movie
<Davie_Jones> Like.. RED hair
<StickySyrup> (I have red hair)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Dat me :3
<Dken2021> you never seen it?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm the one talking with the monster ^_^
<Davie_Jones> i think Lauren just grabbed all of the people she used to work with when she made MLP
<Davie_Jones> Everyone who writes episodes in the show has worked with her before.
<Phase4> never seen the powerpuff girls movie
<Phase4> dat ff7 music
<StickySyrup> when the magical creation of MLP was born
<Phase4> its funny, i'm an 18yo male thats never watched the powerpuff girls movie.
<Davie_Jones> Wait....Not Charoltte Fullerton
<Davie_Jones> Nevermind
<Phase4> would it count as an a or b movie?
<Davie_Jones> It was a TV movie.
<Phase4> looks like a b
<Dken2021> so TV movies are automatic B?
<StickySyrup> I heard you!
<Davie_Jones> They usually have lower budgets
<Dken2021> what? ebert gave the movie a thumbs down because it was too violent
<StickySyrup> LOL this made me LOL !http://mickeymonster.deviantart.com/art/TeNEIGHcious-D-A-Tribute-281684405
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I never watched the Powerpuff Girls movie either
<Davie_Jones> Violent?
<Phase4> Dken2021, wait wut
<Davie_Jones> Whois Ebert anyway?
<Phase4> movie critic
<Dken2021> under reception
<Davie_Jones> And who is he?
<Phase4> ebert
<Phase4> :P
<Dken2021> he's a famous critc
<Davie_Jones> It's meant to be read in a tone that suggests that he has no credabilty in reviewing anything.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02i liek poniez :3

<SuperBrony64> 10,02i liek poniez :3
<Davie_Jones> A good review of a critic is to see what he likes.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02i liek california :3
<Davie_Jones> I can't find his critic of the movie in question
<SuperBrony64> 10,02We Wish You A Merry Christmas ^_^
<Phase4> "Ebert & Roeper gave it "two thumbs down," criticizing that the movie was too violent." from wikipedia is all i can find to
<Davie_Jones> So I'll go by his face. He has an eternal frown that has led to fat to gather at the bottom of his cheeks leading to big jiggling gobles that remind me of McCain so Idon't like him already.
<Davie_Jones> They should have a citation
<Dken2021> silly sb, chrismas in february.. what a silly idea
<Phase4> SuperBrony64, we seem to have left you out of the chat, sry

<SuperBrony64> 10,02You can lose your horn...
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Sure it fetches a pretty penny on the black market
<StickySyrup> The pink market. We all know Pinkie is an Illegal trader

<bugeyes8> I consider it a compliment
<MakerDusk> and they are catagorized by:physics, math, other, undefined
<bugeyes8> NItches love gay people
<bugeyes8> What?
<ofna01> my voice still hasent changed,so i still have a high pitched voice
<bugeyes8> What about the engineeers?
<ofna01> makes me sounds gay XD
<MakerDusk> other
<MakerDusk> with one foot in physics and math
<bugeyes8> Really? i would think engineers get their own class
*ofna01 looks at bugeyes and says,"need a dispenser here!"
*bugeyes8 I'm afraid not.
*ofna01 rolls on floor laughing
<MakerDusk> engineering classes are dumbed down versions of physics and math
<bugeyes8> Yay, I'm funny!
<ofna01> im honestly surprised i've never been asked out before
<MakerDusk> they just have practical classes on top of them
<unfoundbug> engineering is the practical application of maths and physics
<ofna01> alotta the girls at school tell me im cute
<unfoundbug> no point of either of the later without application
<ofna01> weird huh
<bugeyes8> Not better or worse than physicists
<MakerDusk> that's what experimental physicists are for
<bugeyes8> just a practical application of it.
<ofna01> enough school talk for now guys
*Rain throws a table and tries to sleep again
<ofna01> im on break
*bugeyes8 catches table, drops it on toe
<bugeyes8> OW
*ofna01 glares at rain,"wtf,why'd you throw a table at me!?"
<bugeyes8> I took that bullet for you all.
<ofna01> yyour dillusional bug

*ofna01 wonders if rain is ok

<bugeyes8> God this is a good movie
<ofna01> never heard of it bugeyes8
<ofna01> whats it about?
<bugeyes8> zit's written by Carl Sagan.
<bugeyes8> It's about science, faith, and reason.

<Nick> Freaking chrome crashing when i close youtube
<ofna01> niiiice pic saturn
<unfoundbug> Oooh wreck stream
<ofna01> Safari>Chrome
<Wrek> 05firefox>all
<Nick> Really. safari.
<Nick> Really?
<ofna01> nope.pony
<Simon2> Chrome>Firefox
<unfoundbug> Firefox < ponies
<Nick> yes simon, thank oyu, also hello again
<Wrek> 05speaking of firefox
<ofna01> Chrome > Firefox,Safari > Chrome
<Wrek> 05check my browser icon
<xcanox> I wrecked Google Chrome by using Google Maps.
<Simon2> Chrome>Safari
<Nick> All i see is a heart attack inducing twilight
<unfoundbug> nice
<Simon2> Ponies>=Chrome
<xcanox> It crashed and wouldn't start up ever again.
<ofna01> : D
<unfoundbug> ALL the pixels!
<xcanox> That's why you don't use Google products!

<Nick> Count he pixels, all six

<Simon2> @pokemon
<Steven_Magnet> 9 Simon2 is a/an 0 Pelipper
<Nick> Firefox became bloatware 4 years agp
<unfoundbug> opera is still nice and thin
<ofna01> so safari>all
<Nick> Do not start simon2
<Simon2> Chrome>Safari
<ofna01> noone uses god damn opera
<unfoundbug> Doom 2: The Plutonia Experiment (Played by Wrek)
<Nick> Lolopera
<unfoundbug> oops, just meant to copy that
<unfoundbug> Most people on my course at uni run opera
<Nick> Safari is chrome without any usability.
<unfoundbug> about 25/30
<Nick> I'm not saying you're not allowed to use safari.
<Nick> Also I'm bugeyes8 simon2
<unfoundbug> Love and tolerate, even if people have odd browser choices
<derpy_pony> this level looks interesting
<Simon2> Speed & Security: Chrome ; Customization: Firefox
<Nick> Essentialy, yes
<Nick> it like comparing OSX to linux
<Wrek> 05Opera, the hipsters choice!
<unfoundbug> OSX, overpriced, over restricted, no games
<unfoundbug> linux free, poor ui, but runs on anything
<Nick> That's what i don't get about gamers choosing macs.
<Nick> But its the core 'values' i'm talking about.
<Nick> OSX has no customization, but linux has no speed or security
<unfoundbug> like value for money? your paying at least 50% more for a mac for comparable hardware
<unfoundbug> LOL!
<unfoundbug> seriously nick?
<unfoundbug> linux no speed/security?
<unfoundbug> there is a reason its used for every major server ever
<Nick> I spend 3 hours trying to get my linux computer to run
<unfoundbug> an OS is only ever as good as its user
<Nick> I simply don't have the time for messing with everything everytime i want to use my computer
<Nick> I don't use OSX
<unfoundbug> operating system, windows linux or mac
<Nick> I use windos 7. Not too happy about it, but i have to game, and i don't have time for linux bullsh*t
<Saturn> 8,1http://i.imgur.com/hrpFi.jpg
<Nick> I configured an old laptop to linux for learning, and it is a huge pain to get to do ahything
<Simon2> wtf horse
<unfoundbug> wow, thats creepy
<Nick> GAH
<Saturn> 8,1i use Linux mainly, because it's my most comfortable envirnoment to work in, probably mainly out of habit
<unfoundbug> The point of linux is long setup, never ever goes down afterwards
<Nick> Dude, that';s creepy
<Saturn> 8,1but i also have mac os and windows installed
<Saturn> 8,1windows for gaming, and mac os for... well, just because it's fun to have a hackintosh
<unfoundbug> lol
<Nick> I understand the draw for linux, I just don't have the time for it.
<Wrek> 05i run OS8 in an emulater enviroment
<Nick> Makes sense
<Saturn> 8,1though really, i don't actually game much
<Wrek> 05im telling ya, extracting ROM files is hard work
<Saturn> 8,1literally, the time i spend gaming is about a week or two every year
<Nick> That's ok, i don't game as much as i say
<Nick> maybe an hour or two a week
<unfoundbug> Hell yeah
<unfoundbug> go marathon
<Saturn> 8,1but it's nice being able to boot into any of the three main OSes when i need to
<ofna01> http://kiyoshiii.deviantart.com/favourites/?offset=0#/d4nosqu
<unfoundbug> d'awww filly derp
<ofna01> derpeh ^_^
<Saturn> 8,1but yeah, i'd recommend mac os over linux any day, unless you have a specific reason to use linux
<Saturn> 8,1and this is coming from a massive linux nerd ;)
<Wrek> 05something is eating my comp power
<Wrek> 05but oh well
<Wrek> 05lets see how this goes
<Saturn> 8,1Wrek: it's me
<unfoundbug> Wrek, the stream :P
<Saturn> 8,1i'm a chubbysaturn, nomming on your cables
<Nick> Like i said, i have a little experience with linux, but not enough t be good enough for my main computer to run off it
<Wrek> 05nope unfoundbug
<Wrek> 05had it been that i wouldnt mention it
<unfoundbug> fair enough
<Saturn> 8,1Nick: one of the best ways to learn it is to force yourself to use it, then you get accustomed to it
<unfoundbug> The only time i get performance hits anymore is fraps
<Nick> And i use chrome for it's speed and Awesome UI
<Saturn> 8,1chrome is awesome, but i do have a couple of gripes with it (mainly UI, but some API too)
<unfoundbug> 1080p recording is not a subtle thing
<Saturn> 8,1but still, it's sooo much better than firefox
<Nick> My graphics card handles recording BF3 in 1080 like a champ
<Saturn> 8,1even if it takes up a hell of a lot more memory
