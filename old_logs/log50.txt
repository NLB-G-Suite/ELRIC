<Annomaniac> Godfather has B-budget but is an A-movie.
<Combustiblelemons> ^that
<SilverMane> this is a very Brony-friendly scene, talking about Friendship
<HuffytheMagicDragon> MOAW
<Tacowiz> So far this movie bores me.
<DSNesmith> that cat
<Razyn> Everything I know about this is a lie.

<Saddletramp> how much have i missed
<Twistcity> so much friendship

<Elky> oh you taco
<Darf14> A B that became an a, this is a good example of one

<Tacowiz> Spider's Web>The Godfather
<DentistBrony> cat is like, "no, you aint done with those petting man thing!"

<Hipster_Brony> 8this guy needs to learn the meaning of friendship
<Saddletramp> now better than a rocket launcher

<Aponymous> This movie would be much better with Tommy Wiseau.
<Combustiblelemons> *fangasm*
<Twistcity> squeeeeeeeeeee
<UncleOrange> Johnny was planking before it was mainstream
<SirSprinkles> 6Sathi is Hipster.

<SilverMane> Elky is now Flowergirl, sorry Dashite. You can be a groomsman though
<Forderz> This movie is better with DSII button spam

<SirSprinkles> 6And the real Sathi can't get in the channel because of it.
<mysterypony> he need that one dude who need that FUCKING MONEY

<DentistBrony> *fanscream*
<Eldrad> YOURE TEARING ME APART JOHNNY

<Niishere> I'm a black belt in pretty much everything. Including bedroom.
<Bjornfot> 0Of course, SecondSepharim... but their marks would be very... subtle, only hinting
<Sathi> are the 4chan people still in?
<Purple`Prose> pony lingerie designer?
<Silver> 'Pillow Talk'

<CircuitMane> I'm a business man, I make it my business to be a man
<Bjornfot> 0They both affect the liver.

<Combustiblelemons> I wonder if bill clinton is now a brony...
<Suinide> Iz take care of him
<sotha> KristjanKirax, it depends on what kind of University, who your friendgroup is, which types of classes. It is impossible to correctly gauge potential responses without knowing most of the variables.

<Cynder7> 6My Icy sim..
<Hipster_Brony> its not adding any extra security
<Dashite> But they'd never vote for you. You aren't insane enough to get elected in the US.

<Combustiblelemons> Has rarity eating paste been done yet?
<Senor_BroZilla> >not invited to groupsex
<Starscream> 4Really?Mine too

<nurgle> i havent been paying attention to the movie
<sotha> Did KristjanKirax get that?
<Locke> >dying with bullets... laaaaame
<Silver> Every pony is always in love with Dash. The only reason not to be is if you don't swing her way... and that just means you're in denial.
<thetrollside> silvermane gets to be in RD shipping fics? lucky motherfuker
<Suinide> Still im watching you...*licks my jealousy claws*

<Elky> because there are no OCs yet...
<Hobo> 0What's a Shrew?
<Bjornfot> 0Silver... that's just silly. Who doesn't swing towards awesome rainbow ponies?
<Unknown> I liked the fic where EVERYPONY tries to hook up with dash and then at the end it turns out she's heterosexual.
<Hobo> 0??
<Locke> You have shrews?
<Hipster_Brony> 8too many vendettas
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> ARE THERE ANY OC/RAINBOW DASH SHIPPING FICS
<SilverMane> a shrew is a small mouse-like animal
<Ghosties> 4Because they all line up for Rainbow Dash, Hip?
<Darf14> They were killed by V!
<Locke> and there's a season for shrews?
<nah> dermathil change of plans you're the minister of defense

<Suinide> lol im jking
<Niishere> Oh please, Dash x Spitfire is FAR more likely.
<Chimera> Also hey Aurora~ not much
<Suinide> Sorta...
<RainBroDash> 10photofinishhim I agree. DashxSoarin is almost as good as DashxVinyl
<Chimera> In Virginia Beach
<Locke> Everything i know about Italy I learned from Hetalia
<Zambrony> Is this movie almost over?
<issac_johnington> I dunno, it interferes with my OTP of Soarinxapplepie photofinishhim
<Cynder7> 6Meh.. xP
<Angel_Espeon> 13.w.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was... interesting
<IronPoptart> I think the filmography in general looks fantastic...
<Niishere> *brohoof* thetrollside
<Silver> Dash x Soarin' needs more Spitfire, absolutely.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> DASH X SOARIN IS BETTER!!!
<Elky> Appledash is canon
<Suinide> *holds my crotch* dammit icy
<KristjanKirax> 0...self-insert fic... must resist writing
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think they're writing a fic about it now too
<Ghosties> 4IronPoptart: Don't forget, her Rainboom did bring all the girls closer together
<Veewave> Are you sure this isn't China?
<RainbowLoon> Zambrony: far from it
<SilverMane> JACK X SOARIN
<IronPoptart> Ah...ah!

<Angel_Espeon> 13:P
*Cynder7 6approaches the spike.
<Ghosties> 4nah: exactly

<KristjanKirax> 0Oh wait, have a Touhou Crossover fic I'd have to write first
<Niishere> Obviously
<SilverMane> ^
<photoFINISHHIM> okay bronies, I'm talking about the only STRAIGHT Dash ship, DashxVinyl Scratch and DashxSpitfire are best otherwise
<drfsupercenter> 03but I had to fix mine with duct tape and that kinda sucks
<ValtheJean> but Soarin likes pies!
<Cynder7> 6CAUSE THAT'S THE COOL THING TO DO
<Elky> I'm not even sure what the chat is about atm
<HaxBrony> And this one time, she flew so fast, she gave all her friends puberty
<Zambrony> >_<
<Starscream> 4prince-dari look at this
<IronPoptart> SoarinxPinkiePie!
<ValtheJean> are you a pie hater? ARE YOU??? O_o
<Applegenier> 7how long till this movie is over?
<Suinide> everyone fwiendly
<Starscream> 4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vnelx6VLm9Y
<SilverMane> can someone explain why someone wrote a Bible Black parody fanfic?
<Cynder7> 6Oh noes.
<thetrollside> DASH BEIN STRAIGHT IS NOT AN OPTION
<Flutterpeanut> I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON ANYMORE
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> IS SOARIN X DASH THE ONLY STRAIGHT MLP SHIP FIC?
<TheOwl> appledash is best, fuck all yall
<issac_johnington> Soarinxpinkie pie? that's new
<Bjornfot> 0STRAIGHT daship? OLOLO
<Uncle_Orange> wats after this movie?
<Ghosties> 4HaxBrony: Haha, their cutie marks=puberty
<Combustiblelemons> Dash is straight.
<Elky> what owl said
<ThatGuyWithThePonyThread> Shits about to go down
<issac_johnington> Appledash is meeeh
<Ghosties> 4I don't either
<Sathi> 7neither do I
<nukeiffum> >only 5 people
<HaxBrony> eeyup
<nukeiffum> oh
<SilverMane> seriously, why a Bible Black parody?
<Elky> though AJxRarity iseven better
<photoFINISHHIM> the only straight ship fic for Dash that makes sense yeah
<Niishere> Oh, no she's not
<Zambrony> Dash is straight, Faust said so somewhere
<Sathi> 7I just read and try to understand :)
<nah> @themarewhoarrangestheblocks nope
<Cynder7> 6._.
<DashAttack> i refuse to accept that thetrollside
<Tallasisco> Sorry I'm late
<DashAttack> :P
<Bjornfot> 0Appledash is weh but makes incredibly much sense.
<Ghosties> 4I think Michael might have an affair with this Sicilian woman
<Combustiblelemons> Damn rainbows being associated with gays...
<Ghosties> 4And Vito is alive
<Hobo> 0Pacino has balls
<issac_johnington> more actually faust said "Who the hell cares?"
<Purple`Prose> ...NO
<Ghosties> 4That's about it
<Elky> faust didn't say anything on the matter
<IronPoptart> I think Dash is totally uninterested.
<Tallasisco> What's happened so far?
<photoFINISHHIM> best STRAIGHT Dash ship pair: discuss
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> nah wat others are there
<Suinide> *licks the spike*
<whatisthis> I think Dash is asexual.
<Dashite> Faust said "Not going there"
<Applegenier> 0stupid gays associating themselves with rainbows
<Lonelyweeaboo> Happy Brony Day!
<whatisthis> And she reproduces asexually.
<Zambrony> oh, nvm
<Niishere> Yeah, faust has no opinion on pony sexuality.
<ValtheJean> she said it isn't in the show, nor is it even a concern
<Hipster_Brony> 8i personally think of all the ponies as straight because im straight and i think of that as "normal"
<HaxBrony> @combustiblelemons gays only use them cuz they represent diversity
<Bjornfot> 0no Zambrony, Faust never said that, she just said that she doesn't necessarily have to be gay
<Uncle_Orange> Dash is without a doubt asexual
<TheOwl> although the best dash ship is rainbow dash x cloudy dash
<Aponymous> Look to the left, Mob movie. Look to the right, Dash shipping discussion.
<Elky> iirc, she said sexual stuff won't be in the show
<nah> themarewhoarrangestheblocks ziggy and scratch and then everyone and mac
<BronyDay> only rarity cares about anything, all others are oblivious
<Purple`Prose> I sense a mob...
<ValtheJean> in other words, she said there is no canon on that because it doesn't exist
<Ziltoid> Dash is omnisexual
<Aponymous> What?
<Silver> Somepony requested the Dash x Cloud clopfic, so here it is.

<Silverfish2> 0It was Vizini all along. Wasn't he from the Princess Bride?
<RainbowSmash> I love that line; "Tattaglia's a pimp, he could never have outsmarted Sonny"
<Combustiblelemons> well one of them are.
<Hobo> 0How did we get to a discussion about Minecraft?
<UncleOrange> Minecraft has better multiplayer though....
<How_Equestria_Was_Made> It never ends.
<Silverfish2> 0Vizini?
<Elky> you can torrent minecraft?
<DSNesmith> ugh this is torturous
<NeighBro> I AM DAVE! YOGNAUT AND I HAVE THE BALLS!
<nickstr> thought it was going to be today but I got a crap transmitter that will not pass RDS and is broken for FM stereo
<nurgle> terraria has better singleplayer
<DashAttack> Minecraft was fun for a while, then i just got tired of building buildings
<Razyn> I think Hipster
<Dermathil> Terraria is a metroidvania mixed with minecraft. Best description.
<DentistBrony> can someone give me an estimate as to how much longer this is?
<Locke> ADD Hobo
<Razyn> get's cooler every week
<Hipster_Brony> how far in are we, sprinkles?
<Elky> I thought it worked with an account system
<ValtheJean> I said the same thing too Hipster, until I played it and got hooked. (Ignoring the fact that after a few months I'm now bored with it <.< >.>)
<Suinide> ..yes :P
<InterestingFact> Minecraft is like the Hitler of video game talks. Everything eventually leads to it.
<Hobo> 0lol
<Hipster_Brony> or actually
<TGPFluttershy> Any word on a mac version for TErraria?
<Hipster_Brony> how much time is left?
<Cynder7> 6Sims :P
<DSNesmith> this movie needs more cheese
<Flutterpeanut> I don't knoowwww
<TheOwl> I don't know what the point of minecraft is
<Suinide> Which one
<Flutterpeanut> But I want it to be over
<DSNesmith> EH MARCO?
<Cynder7> 6Woo! River became a teen.. :3
<Combustiblelemons> man this movie is torturously slow...

<Psi> Thats a very nice everything you've got there!^
<HaxBrony> OMG NO WAI! official character description videos on youtube
<Silverfish2> 0If you are true yognaughts finish this sentence: I am a Dwarf and I'm digging a _
<Cynder7> 6Castaway stories..
<DSNesmith> oh god 30 minutes
<UncleOrange> Getting a gold chest is like finding a chozo statue in metroid
<Unknown> Ok, I missed it, what happened to Micheal's hot Sicilian wife?
<HaxBrony> awesums
<Locke> 30 minutes?!
<vagrant> the point of Minecraft is autism
<TheOwl> as far as I can tell it's about making buildings in 1993 graphics
<Tyranico> I love the background music though
<Elky> owl: you have to determine the point yourself
<RainbowSmash> Basically
<Combustiblelemons> 30 mins left?
<prince-dari> God, some of you guys are so impatient. :P
<How_Equestria_Was_Made> This movie is about 3 hours long.
<prince-dari> No staying power.

<Fengor> every minute is amazing imo
<Ghosties> 4Oh shit, I forgot about the selection thread
<RainbowSmash> xD
<Silverfish2> 0He's kinda short
<Ghosties> 4Listen
<ValtheJean> it's a shame that modern society is so impatient now...Sleep well classic cinema, your life was well lived
<UncleOrange> So there are like... 20 minutes left?
<Unknown> NOW GET IN
<Zambrony> When did the movie start?
<How_Equestria_Was_Made> *fluttershy voice* 3 hours long... that's what I said...
<DSNesmith> END MOVIE
<DSNesmith> damn
<Srake> Its not too late its never too late
<Ghosties> 4If I don't make it back in time, can I just give you guys my two picks?
<DSNesmith> and then they all fucked, the end, finite
<RanYakumo> Silverfish2 Well, short people often do have inferiority complexes. Look at Napoleon for example.
<TenchiFreak5> Get Kay on the rebound!
<Locke> >Hot wife dies in fiery explosion... get second best
<Elky> freaking chat and freaking wine made me not enjoy this movie...
<Hipster_Brony> sure
<Ghosties> 4In the case I'm selected?
<Silverfish2> 0So I herd you liek fish
<Locke> meh.jpg
<Hobo> 0lol
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<DSNesmith> Napoleon wasn't really that short
<RainbowSmash> Wait for when Corleone dies, it's a funny scene imo
<Caulron> Be patient
<Darken_Skye> Napoleon wasnt short
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<Keiw> shoot im left handed
<Elky> you're evil people, 'bronies'...
<nah> he was 5'7
<Combustiblelemons> whining? I am not whining...
<Ghosties> 4The Wicker Man (original) for "A" film
<Unknown> ^
<InsertCupcake> 4th red bull down 1 left
<Combustiblelemons> I am complaining.
<Darken_Skye> that was a myth spread by the english
<Silverfish2> 0He was actually slightly taller then the average frenchmen
<DoctorWhooves> 0how much longer does this have
<Silver> 5
<nah> he just surrounded himself with 6'8 body guards
<ValtheJean> Napoleon was angry because of all his hemorroids
<DSNesmith> ololol Elky
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<UncleOrange> I stopped caring about this movie a looooong time ago
<HaxBrony> lol elky
<Cynder7> 6You think that having those two makes me obsessed? :P
<KristjanKirax> 0I'm not evil... now my brother...
<InsertCupcake> once i break that wall of being tired i wont need anymore
<Silver> 5'7 is short in modern times, but not back in the day.
<Combustiblelemons> the only line rarity made that i like.
<HaxBrony> we just made the movie 20% cooler thats all
<RanYakumo> And then he invaded Russian and screwed himself over. :D
<RainbowSmash> boo yeah
<RanYakumo> *Russia
<DSNesmith> no, this movie isn't cool
<DSNesmith> it's boring as hell
<Silverfish2> 0My favorite MLP song is Rarity's
<TheOwl> he was 5 7 in french feet
<Cynder7> 6Cause it's much worse than that..
<DSNesmith> sorry film fans
<TheOwl> which is five ten in our feet
<Combustiblelemons> the best is yet to come.
<TheOwl> I think
<Silverfish2> 0Catchy
<Elky> just like with se7en... I have to remember not to watch serious movies with you...
<nah> has russia ever been successfully invaded
<Israphel> BECAUSE NOPONY INVADES RUSSIA!
<nurgle> i like winter wrap up
<RanYakumo> I like this movie actually.
<Hobo> 0Everyone who has invaded Russia has suffered a crushing a defeat
<ValtheJean> Forgive me while I go cry myself to sleep now
<Silver> This is a very good movie, but it's not a movie you can possibly watch while distracted.
<DSNesmith> lol
<Sidworth> he was 5'7 in french feet, which is 5'2 by imperial measurement
<Hipster_Brony> 8abe vigoda lol
<RainbowSmash> 3 months of winter coolness, and awesome holidays!
<DSNesmith> I'm fine with serious movies
<DSNesmith> as long as they're not boring
<DSNesmith> and aren't 3 hours long
<UncleOrange> Everyone says this is the best movie ever... But I don't get it
<Silverfish2> 0Or the Gala, if only for Rainbow's solo
<XenoBrony> My blessing...you has it
<prince-dari> Rainbow Dash's section of the gala song is the most awesome.
<Keiw> its ok DSN this movie is for a niche audience
<Combustiblelemons> Uhh hate to burst your bubble but the french did
<RanYakumo> It's mainly because said people who invade Russia are retards.
<Aponymous> Abe Vigoda, Before GoodBurger
<HaxBrony> At the gala has the best solo evars
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari: isnt that obvious?
<TheOwl> so did the nazis
<RanYakumo> LET'S NOT BRING WINTER CLOTHES FOR TEH LULZ
<sexysquirt> ;)
<Starscream> 4eww
<HaxBrony> but wwu is my favorite song
<nurgle> yeah, rainbowdash gala
<nah> rainbow poni is best poni
<charmin> fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!
<DSNesmith> Gala has the best solos
<Suinide> Lol no :P i guess obsessed was to extreme of a word, do you like the sims a whole lot?
<Silverfish2> 0APPLEJACK IS STILL BEST PONY
<DSNesmith> but Art of the Dress is the catchiest
<RainbowSmash> Rainbow Dash's part of every song is the best
<Elky> even though I don't really like Rainbow, dari is right here.
<Ghosties> 4And...hmm
<nah> @silverfish2 NOT HOW YOU SPELL RAINBOW DASH
<Israphel> thats not how you spell Rainbow Dash
<TheOwl> thats not how you spell pinkie pie
<HaxBrony> rainbow dash's solo may have been the best thing on TV evar
<prince-dari> Hipster_Brony: Yeah, but I like it over Winter Wrap Up.
<SilverSonic> :o
<nurgle> fluttershy and RD are the best
<Keiw> Buck apples eh?
<RanYakumo> Applejack ought to get one song of her own in Season 2 at least.
<SilverSonic> cool
<Hipster_Brony> 8eh
<TheOwl> SEASON TWO NEEDS A RD SOLO SONG BTW
<Fengor> niche audience Keiw? Hold on, I have to google some stuff
<Combustiblelemons> I think britain invaded russia too...
<nurgle> never really liked applejack
<UncleOrange> Winter wrap up and art of the dress are good,,, but I like cupcakes because it's the only song I've memorized completely
<Cynder7> 6Yeah..
<DSNesmith> WWU won the 'suprise song' award
<Hobo> 0I love how Don Corleone is just staring at the fish while this is being dicussed
<Israphel> Nurgle, love you forever now
<Hipster_Brony> 8i like Dash's verse on WWU more
<Ghosties> 4mfw the only "B" film I can think of is Freddy Got Fingered >.<
<Elky> Applejack had the best part of WWU however
<Ghosties> 4But that's my choice
<Locke> This movie needs to winter wrap up!
<Combustiblelemons> Was the light brigade english or french?
<Ghosties> 4WAIT
<Locke> Heyyo!
<Hipster_Brony> 8Elky: nope
<Ghosties> 4NO
<DSNesmith> No, I'm gonna agree that Dash had the best part in WWU
<Israphel> Cupcakes is easy to memorize
<ValtheJean> lol, that's because you like anything with Dash :P
<TheOwl> Britain never *invaded* so much as bought all the banks and made it it's bitch
<nurgle> fawww ty israphel
<DSNesmith> and let the sunshine iiiin
<Applegenier> 0agreed Elky
<Ghosties> 4Evil Dead 3: Army of Darkness
<Hipster_Brony> 8AJ's verse on WWU wasn't very good IMO
<Flutterpeanut> Want me to give a suggestion?
<Cynder7> 6I basically have all the sims games on my computer..exept from the TS3 expansions..
<Elky> hipster: anti-nope?
<TheOwl> Russia is a british crypto-colony lol
<Ghosties> 4That's my "B" choice
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<Flutterpeanut> Oh.
<Hipster_Brony> 8weakest part of the song
<Flutterpeanut> xD
<DSNesmith> yeah AJ was kind of forgettable in WWU
<nah> @israphel all you gotta do is take a cup of flour
<Bjornfot> 0AJ verse is best verse!
<Ghosties> 4Thanks guys
<Elky> :(
<DeathXp> Season two needs a Fluttershy song. About the length of AoTD at least.
<DSNesmith> but Twi's solo was fantastic in WWU
<RainbowSmash> we move the clouds and we melt the white snoooow!
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> AJ NEEDS MOAR SONGS
<Elky> Y U HATE ON AJ
<Applegenier> 0IT'S JUST SO MUCH TO DO~
<Keiw> true death
<Silverfish2> 0APPLEJACK NEEDS MORE EVERYTHING.
<HaxBrony> Dash needs moar songs
<DSNesmith> lol, AJ just isn't a singing pony
<Combustiblelemons> We tamed the biggest country in the world
<Hobo> 0Light Brigade was English
<UncleOrange> MONTAGE TIME
<RainbowLoon> wat?
<TheOwl> but season 1 had a fluttershy song
<Combustiblelemons> makes me prouder to be british
<prince-dari> Because AJ and Twilight are worst ponies. :P
<charmin> I just wanted to see BFE
<DSNesmith> Applejack does need more love in Season 2
<Silverfish2> 0It should just be called the applejack show
<Sidworth> Applejack needs more hats
<HaxBrony> or is there a video of her solo looped for ike an hour on youtube
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> 1940S LAS VEGAS FTW!!!!!
<Suinide> See? Thats why i use obsessed
<nah> @prince-dari BURN THE HERETIC
<Unknown> Oh man. MLP Newborn Cuties is pure evil excreted from satan's anus.
<Combustiblelemons> ikr
<Hipster_Brony> 8disagree about twilight dari
<Hobo> 0Led by Lord Cardington
<Elky> uh, Ashleigh Ball is a singer actually...
<RainbowSmash> oh shit, this is going to take a while
<Singed_Iz_Brony> umm
<Keiw> But i like southern comfort applejack....
<Silverfish2> 0I'm liking this idea.
<Singed_Iz_Brony> AJ is second best pony
<DSNesmith> MLP newborn cuties
<Singed_Iz_Brony> what are u smoking
<DSNesmith> DEAR GOD
<DSNesmith> WHY
<Bjornfot> 0oh prince-dari you troll, twilight is best unicorn at least
<DSNesmith> WHYYYYY
<Applegenier> 0applejack needs more sentrys and dispensers
<Combustiblelemons> Applejack isn't really that loved is she.
<Toty> prince-dari the fuck did you just say?
<sexysquirt> APPLEJACK BEST PONY FLUTTERSHY SECOND BEST PONY RAINBOW DASH THIRD BEST PONEY
<Hipster_Brony> 8twilight is my 2nd favorite, after Dash
<Senor_BroZilla> I can't seem to like Pinkie too much, I suppose...
<Locke> DEAN JERRY AND MARTIN LEWIS?!
<Elky> I'd like an AJ/RD duet in season 2
<TenchiFreak5> Season Two needs a Fluttershy song that takes up an entire span of time between commercials.
<Singed_Iz_Brony> AJ is 2nd best pony fools
<KristjanKirax> 0I have no idea who my fave pony is
<nurgle> lots of people do not like rarity, i do not see why
<nah> hipster_brony knows his stuff
<DSNesmith> Rarity is best pony
<Combustiblelemons> No memorable episodes for applejack
<prince-dari> Twilight's personality is the most boring and generic I've ever seen.
<DSNesmith> easy
<Incral> Purple pony is best pony.
<prince-dari> :P
<InsertCupcake> suddenly dancing
<XenoBrony> Sandvich Sandvich, Pinkie loves her Sandvich! tomatoes lettuce cheese and bread! Makes me strong to beat up Red!
<UncleOrange> The best two are Fluttershy and Rarity
<Hipster_Brony> SPRINKLES, Y U NO ANSWER?!
<Silverfish2> 0Does anybody even like Rarity? She's kind of a bitch.
<HaxBrony> hipster knows wherof he speaks
<Prison> Hi there, everypony!
<Caulron> pony pokey
<DeathXp> FUCK YOU SEXYSQUIRT! Fluttershy is best pony.
<DSNesmith> She's a fabulous bitch though
<RanYakumo> I don't really like Twilight all that much.
<Senor_BroZilla> DSNesmith knows what's good
<Combustiblelemons> +
<Cynder7> 6Yeah..You already knew what was coming.. :P
<Combustiblelemons> oops
<Flutterpeanut> I think he fell asleep.
<Hobo> 0I like Rarity
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari: nope
<DentistBrony> she's friggin adorkable though
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> TWILIGHT IS BEST PONY
<Singed_Iz_Brony> 1. Fluttershy (duh) 2. AJ -_-
<Prison> 6What's up?
<Locke> Luna is best pony
<Unknown> I LOVE Rarity. I've got a pair of Rarity shot glasses coming in the mail this week.
<Hobo> 0She's not my favourite though
<Singed_Iz_Brony> deal with it
<Silverfish2> 0One fabulous bitch.
<Elky> twilight's? really? did you even look at Fluttershy?
<prince-dari> Eeyup
<Bjornfot> 0WTF, prince-dari? SHe's an aspie. Nothing normal with her.
<Combustiblelemons> heh.
<Sathi> 7will you be around tomorrow?
<Cynder7> 6Icy grew up and is wearing a hat!
<DSNesmith> I thought I was gonna hate Rarity when I started watching
<Locke> LUUUUNA
<Hipster_Brony> 8AJ has the most generic personality
<Combustiblelemons> here's the pony debate
<DashAttack> i like Twilight though =/
<Senor_BroZilla> SEXY, NAUGHTY, BITCHY ME
<Israphel> RD#1, FS#2, AJ#3, PP#4, TS#5, Rarity#6
<Silver> I wish Tara Strong recorded on sight with the others. I think the separation does hinder her voice work.
<Starscream> 4lol
<DentistBrony> BRONIES Please, a little more love and tolerance please!
<RanYakumo> In order, it'd be Applejack, Rainbow Dash/Fluttershy (tie), Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Twilight Sparkle.
<DSNesmith> it took me maybe two episodes to love her
<TheOwl> IF ANY OF THEM WERE REAL PEOPLE I'D DAT ANY OF THEM THOUGH
<Caulron> cheerilee is the best pony
<Singed_Iz_Brony> LOL
<KristjanKirax> 0Twilight, Fluttershy, Dash and Pinkie are all tied for my top spot so far...
<DashAttack> she's adorkable
<Senor_BroZilla> THAT DAMN SONG IS STUCK IN MY HEAD
<Silver> *on site
<Singed_Iz_Brony> Rarity is the freaking epitome of generic -_-
<Cynder7> 6Which I shall take off and make Icy hatless.
<Prison> 0What movie are we watching, guys?
<Combustiblelemons> Rainbow dash is always number one.
<UncleOrange> WHY DOES EVERYPONY HATE RARITY?
<Applegenier> 0OH NO

<Sol> TECHNICOLOR! FUCK YEAH
<Fengor> I'm rather disappointed to see that showing this movie made more haters than fans
<Elky> so gone with the wind you be okay with y'all?
<Silver> The Godfather starts very slowly, and introduces a lot of completely uninteresting characters (like Michael's first wife, and Sonny) just to kill them off. Frankly, the first two hours could be shaved down to one without losing very much.
<Combustiblelemons> NewDCD is the broadcaster.
<UOrange> I will go insane if I win the lottery
<HaxBrony> IT IS DONE
