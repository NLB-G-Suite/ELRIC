<Reikim|Preread> I am content.

<Pinkies4thWall> cachi01|phone: I don't think so
*Pinkies4thWall hugs LadyCanary
<Reikim|Preread> At least they don't have the RP deities hanging around.
<ScootaChicken> Honestly, I just get upset because whenever I look at it I can never see anyone I recognise.
<LadyCanary> ^-^
<ScootaChicken> And the chat is usually really, really boring.
<ScootaChicken> And/or mind numbingly stupid.
<Reikim|Preread> But...but I was in there...
<cachi01|phone> Pinkies4thWall listen to the voice very carefully
<Meanwhile> He's still got a point.
<Reikim|Preread> You don't recognize me?
<ScootaChicken> The mane chat used to be really fun and stuff, but I've just grown really tired of it now.
<ScootaChicken> Which is a shame.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Scoot-Scootaloo: well as long as you dont put the endurance Pmv then we are good :)
<Reikim|Preread> But yeah, mane is usually boring and/or stupid.
<ScootaChicken> Yeah, I recognise you.

<cachi01|phone> Anyway this isnt my cup of tea.
<Pinkies4thWall> Scoot-Scootaloo: Story?
<Meanwhile> Mane chat's been declining for a long time, but nowadays it seems to be dragging the bottom of the barrel.
<Sergio_Scriptor> can't wait to see it Scoot's :)

<Apokalipse> Once it hits rock bottom it can't get much worse, right?

<Meanwhile> Probably not. But it can cause comas.
<AJIsAwesome> Radioactive socks :D

<silverturtle82> sorry
<Reikim|Preread> "“It is useless to hide anything from me. I feel everything you feel Luna. Both emotionally and physically only intensified. That’s what broke the seals that freed me in the first place. Your lust for the lavender mare. Your love for her. Your desire to be in bed with her and having your way.”"
<Reikim|Preread> That's Nightmare Moon speaking.
<Pudge> O_O
<thelonepony> :D
<Reikim|Preread> "Luna blushed immensely after hearing the last one. Did she really love Twilight? Nightmare Moon may have been a monster, but she had some valid points. Deep down she did lust for her, to love her, and to have her way in bed."
<Not_A_Moderator> guess what...
<Derpy_Hooves> Sumica i see what you did there to the script :P
<silverturtle82> what cutting short?
<Reikim|Preread> And then that

<Not_A_Moderator> WRONG...
<DocSane> silverturtle82: It wasn't cut short. They only ordered 13 new episodes for season 3.
<Quick_Thinker> some how when derpy got dissed and removed we actually fought back with words and not actions
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim|Preread i'm sorry but if you accept to pre read this you deserve that suffering
<twilight_sprinkle> Not_A_Moderator: a greater sign, then a bunch of sashes, then an 8
<silverturtle82> yes and there have NEVER been any retarded cartoon characters
<Derpy_Hooves> guys incase your wondering, Sumica edited the kick script to autpo kick you if you mention the title of today's A movie :P
<Reikim|Preread> I didn't know it was this bad!
<Not_A_Moderator> nope...
<twilight_sprinkle> Not_A_Moderator: or is that a lesser sign, idk
<Joy> Love and tolerate!

<AJIsAwesome> Not_A_Moderator: Potpourri?
<Reikim|Preread> I definitely cannot handle any more than that.
<silverturtle82> I feed them muffins : )
<Not_A_Moderator> nope...
<AJIsAwesome> Not_A_Moderator: Piano?
<DocSane> silverturtle82: Most networks only do about 13 new episodes a season, so we've actually been getting double seasons for the last two years.
<Gunthler> fight cĺub

<Reikim|Preread> At least with the first chapter I'll be able to highlight all the major grammatical failings and then say the author can figure out the rest on his/her own.
<twilight_sprinkle> bronydumb
<Derpy_Hooves> Klumzeedragon: NO WAI?!
<Pudge> Obv Sumica is abiding by the first rule of you know what

<Reikim|Preread> Unfortunately that's still a ten-hour download.

<Reikim> But then, when you work five and a half hours with one break, just about anything will amuse you.
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica I think he . . . he did. I would've aimed for the neck.
<RosePetal> Ear Punch is the moost painful punch.
<ScootaChicken> Fun Fact: That punch was entirely unscripted, Brad Pitt expected Edward Norton to hit him in the shoulder, the reaction was entirely real.
<GilDash> Should've asked whether he would punch back. XD
<AlienWarhead> WOAH PUNCH
<p4ngya> love this soundtrack
<Canadian_Brony> Scoot-Scootaloo it was weak
<Tovler> beat that ear like a drum

<SirGanjalf> well, maybe not, but you got my point
<ScootaChicken> Wrek and Scoot-Scootaloo: To be fair, the film does have some fairly blatant homoerotic overtones.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> This movie is not what I thought it'd be like.

<Dark92Enigma> Canadian_Brony: Mayor League Gamer......but close enough
<MrBen> Fight your boss
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Wish I could do that with my boss.
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: why, the switch isnt meant to be a conductor. and if it conducts, itll hit him without water too
<AJIsAwesome> hi Patricia
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Bloody shirt
<DashWithRainbows> But Saxy, what about us HLG people?
<DashWithRainbows> Explain dis.
<RosePetal> Dats a tiny tub.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Er, mute him, I mean.
<MrBen> I think the chat froze on my end. I might have to refresh
<Canadian_Brony> DashWithRainbows what be that?
<pony_300> NOTICE THESE DETAILS they become interesting later
<SaxyPretender> 0,14have no idea what HLG means
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I'm pretty sure he'd kick my ass.
<RosePetal> Okay.
<Sumica> 00,10if he was't leg deap in water he would probably have shoes on to block the current
<Mozdoc> Important to keep smoking at all times, even in the tub.
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: Higher League Gamer? :P

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> swag
<Crainy> SWAG
<GilDash> Dat swag.
<SirGanjalf> Fight Swag
<JESmith71> therainbowvortex: Sumi as usual
<DocSane> This is one of the gayest movies ever made.
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: Movie logics.
<AlienWarhead> This guy is nuts fights everyday, lives in a crappy house, and hears fluttershy all the time
<RosePetal> Does not matter, fangirls love a guy who is crazy, at least that's what I learned from tumblr.
<giant> whatc out for troll
<cowvarkian> hey, doesnt ghosties hate the word swag?
<DashWithRainbows> SaxyPretender Hidden League Gaming. I used to do it a lot in Halo 3, you gain the lead and use hiding spots and wait until the game has ended. The best part is getting the opposite team to join party chat and lie to them where you are and that you can see them.
<DashWithRainbows> It was fun as hell
<Thulu-tan> I could summon you a muffin.
<AJIsAwesome> DocSane: How is this movie homosexual?
<silverturtle82> yay
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<DashWithRainbows> then kids found out about it.
<Thulu-tan> It may not like you though.
<DashWithRainbows> Ruined it so much for me,.
<WildRepublicGuard> dat girl
<OohShiny> DING
<Rosfox> ping
<inkBot> dingadingading
<Reikim> But Phase...I didn't install a muffin button...
<ScootaChicken> AJIsAwesome: How are you not spotting the blatant homoerotic overtones.
<Envenomed> dundundundun
<DocSane> AJIsAwesome: It's a love story between two men.
<BaconMane> 0,5d-d-d-d-ding
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: doesnt matter afaik, he still has 0 potential, while the switch, if it actually conducted, would have a non-zero potential, so i think it would hit him anyway. rubber boots dont stop getting hit by electric fences, for example
<SirGanjalf> cowvarkian: It think YOLO is worse.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14HLG are true pros
<RosePetal> What the? I thought she was ded.
<ScootaChicken> It's a major part of the film.
<Reikim> There is no muffin button...

<Klumzeedragon> Canadian_Brony: It was mentioned above.

<Phase4> Reikim, people complain about the end, and tbh it has problems, but thats because its compared to the rest of the game

<RAWRity> Romney just doesn't have the support base to compete. The democrats is nowhere near as splintered or full of in-fighting as the republicans atm
<MrBen> SirGanjalf: Thanks, now you thinking of Cupcakes, only with bombs instead of knives.
<Envenomed> All you have to do is take a cup of flour!Add it to the mix!
<Michael> omg
<SirGanjalf> and Pinkamena's Promise...
<RosePetal> lol why did you kiss my hand.
<Moopy> i think this is like pinkamena stuff like this
<Reikim> Dunno, I read an article saying he might actually have a shot at winning.
<RosePetal> I just saw woods
<OohShiny> He just wants to play a game
<SirGanjalf> think about penguins
<Fenr> i bet i'm not the only one moving is hand uncomfortably
<Canadian_Brony> premature elightenment?
<Reikim> Partly because of the old saying "change is good". People seem to be naturally wired to vote for something new.
<Canadian_Brony> WTF?!?!?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> This guy is even crazier than the girl.
<JESmith71> This is your pain, this is your pain on drugs
<RosePetal> lol think about the penguins.
<Wirisme> these people are fucked
<Canadian_Brony> is this guy sane!?
<AlienWarhead> Think about ponies
<Reikim> Then there was something about the GOP and all that but I don't remember much.
<Michael> think about ponies!
<RosePetal> He vomitted on her.

<giant> this guy a psycho
<hungergames> i mant hi
<magmablock> Slideshowagain
<Wirisme> _|\ giggle at the ghostie _|\
<RAWRity> Reikim: if that were true (the change thing) then incumbents wouldn't win nearly as often.
<DocSane> This movie is about trying to find sense in a morally collapsing world.
<AJIsAwesome> Yep, this guy's a psycho.
<AlienWarhead> God loves us he made ponies
<Reikim> True enough.
<RosePetal> So be it!
<Malk> Does it sound bad that I think he would make a good cult leader?
<RAWRity> Save an absolute disaster from Obama's campaign, he's gonna win.
<Reikim> In this election, though, it is apparently in full force.
<kidzrul434> MY MIND IS SEXUALLY HARASSING ME! HELP ME!
<Canadian_Brony> this guy is freakin' sane
<cowvarkian> AlienWarhead: implying there is a god
<Michael> he mad
<RainbowGuy> AlienWarhead lol
<RosePetal> I think he is a cult leader.
<Reikim> That's my bet too.
<SirGanjalf> Psychopat who knows chemistry = bad combination
<Kandarihu> DocSane, that speech about God indicates that this guy is part of the moral collapse.
<Ersatz> He'd be great at it.
<DocSane> Brad Pitt IS Osama Bin Laden!
<HoodyNinja|Birfday> ow
<Reikim> Partly because if it isn't I will have to endure up to three different tirades from three different friends.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Malk: I wouldn't be surprised if Manson was sort of like this.
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Yep.
<RosePetal> Dats acid.
<Ghosties> 04Soooo...the lesson here is that once you finally get a scar on your hand you're god incarnate?
<thelonepony> ouch
<HoodyNinja|Birfday> that looked like it hurted
<twilight_sprinkle> DocSane: seems more like its demonstrating the collapse itself rather than looking for any sense
<Kandarihu> The environment they're both rebelling against isn't moral collapse. It's civility.
<cowvarkian> totes mcgotes, ghosties
<Canadian_Brony> Ghosties somethin' like that I guess
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> LOL

<Wirisme> he just talked about it
<Bjornfot> That may be because he's a bigot.
<RosePetal> oh no he knows!
<SirGanjalf> DocSane: BinLaden was a religious fanatic. He wouldn't speak like that about God.
<Phase4> obaba seems like a cool guy

<twilight_sprinkle> ScootaChicken: well, before beinga dick, try actually putting some effort into accusing someone of something
<Ghosties> 04But I don't feel like there's a sense of closure yet
<SaxyPretender> 0,14who has the Canadian equivalent of otanet
<Kandarihu> Even though it wasn't a twist? I ask you. At what point in the movie is it okay to mention that Tyler blew up his condo?
<RosePetal> Jigsaw, these games are not funny.
<DocSane> Dark92Enigma: Keep watching.
<cowvarkian> Dovah: its 139 minutes
<Reikim> My connection's picked up!
<twilight_sprinkle> ScootaChicken: i didnt say anything of the sort.
<Ghosties> 04I feel like we haven't come close to any kind of resolution
<Dark92En|gma> DocSane: As Megaman X said: WHAT AM I FIGHTING FOR
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so onto Carrier Hawks?

<Meanwhile> Presumably Reikim's internet is powered by moose.
<RosePetal> And then he was gone.
<Wirisme> tyler: lol jk

<JESmith71> Hey it's the Haunted Mansion/Phantom Manor from Disneyland
<Klumzeedragon> Ghosties: Its not quite over. :) In the end though, everything comes together.

<shogipony> it's not over yet
<OperatorPony> making bombs?
<RosePetal> Oh my god, human sacrifices!

<DashWithRainbows> suddenly, screen of silver.

<RosePetal> GASP HE'S JUST AN ALTERNATE EGO!
<DIZZYRATCHET> WHOA
<TOY_PON3> Woah!
<cowvarkian> this wasnt much of a twist
<Eli> multiple personality disorder - i love psychology

<AJIsAwesome> otakon: :D
<andy> this is freaky
<RosePetal> He dissapeared.
<Kreature> yep. He is crazy
<Thulhu-tan> Torrents are magical.
<TOY_PON3> lol
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> SCITZO
<ScootaChicken> twilight_sprinkle: It's probably not, this film is a fair bit unrealistic.
<OohShiny> o.o
<otakon> he's losing himself to Tyler Durden
<giant> his imagination has a mind of its own
<RosePetal> He's crazy.
<ScootaChicken> There's a LOT of artistic license with the psychology in this.
<Freefall29> hello everypony
<SirGanjalf> "Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself!"
<TOY_PON3> Tyler is a fucking psycho
<OohShiny> lol
<Dken2021> allo Freefall29
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> whoa
<pony_300> one thing that bugs me is how "tyler" is beating himself up in the lot, and the people ask if they can go next....
<OohShiny> totally nuts
<Dark92En|gma> HE'S AN ALTER EGO ALL ALONG? and HE WAS TALKING TO HIMSELF? HE WAS FIGHTING TO HIMSELF!!!!!?? AND AND AND AND AND AND................Who wrote this, Dr. Insano?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> ScootaChicken: Yeah, this twist is a bit farfetched...
<Freefall29> damn. I forgot about fight club
<BaconMane> 0,5DA FUCK
<Mozdoc> Two of us are in this room. One of us has to die.
<Eli> Dark92Enigma: almost
<NocturnalBlade> Dark92Enigma: eeyup lol
<TOY_PON3> o_o
<twilight_sprinkle> no, Youre insane
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92En|gma, Chuck Palahniuk
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ded
<OohShiny> Tyler is Pinkamena, the other guy is Pinkie
<giant> his alter ego is alive?
<Sumica> 00,10dat lampshadeing
<WildRepublicGuard> ＼(゜ロ＼)
<Mishia> Dark92Enigma: /) dr insanso did, din;t he :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03So... soap was Hobbes?
<DIZZYRATCHET> ded
<RosePetal> No your insane.
<ScootaChicken> DERPDERPDERPDERP: The amount of foreshadowing earlier in the film does give it a bit more credibility though.
<Rustymeat> wha
<OohShiny> 4th wall break
<inkBot> pony_300 when the guy asked to be next tyler wasn't fighting jack
<TOY_PON3> OohShiny: It all makes sense
<Wirisme> :o
<twilight_sprinkle> nah the audience has pretty much figured it out
<RAWRity> I call you back to the scene where he beats himself up in front of his boss: "For some reason, I thought back to my first fight with Tyler"
<TOY_PON3> so true xD
<DocSane> giant: It's an alternate personality struggling for control.
*Bronysith smacks Freefall29
<RosePetal> lol that's so true we have no idea.
<Bronysith> you dont talk about that
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: Calvin was Hobbes...MAD TV FIGHT CLUB PARODY IDEA!
<Canadian_Brony> Scoot-Scootaloo . . . fuck it. Yes. Soap was Hobbes.
<Dken2021> insolent fool
<otakon> THE FUCK
<MrBen> "The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea." Yeah, pretty apt.
<pony_300> inkBot: Who was he fighting?
<Kurra> Oh, I missed the thing where there's the spot on screen that signals a movie operator to put in the next reel of film....
<TOY_PON3> my name is Tyler Durden
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: That's probably the most obvious ones, but there are quite a few more.
<ScootaChicken> *one
<Sumica> 00,10film real change over
<Bronysith> BLOOD
<WildRepublicGuard> oh snap
<inkBot> pony_300 some random dude
<Bronysith> BLOOD BLOOD BLOOD
<Kandarihu> And the movie began with what seemed to be a flash forward of Tyler putting a gun in his mouth. That makes this mindscrew all the more trippy.
<shogipony> sorry all for spilling the beans
<pony_300> ohhhhh okay
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: yup. Like the fact that nobody else ever talked to Tyler.
<TOY_PON3> the moral of the story kids: GET SOME SLEEP
<RAWRity> always to him.
<Dken2021> deja vu, a glitch?
<Freefall29> Bronysith: yeah. but nobody listens to rules 1 and 2 anyways
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<giant> this is what happens when you dont sleep
<DocSane> And yet he revealed it in the first scene. "I knew all this because Tyler knew all this."
<RosePetal> Moral of the stories: Don't do drugs.
<OohShiny> there's a glitch in the matrix
<TOY_PON3> ^
<AJIsAwesome> Remeber kids, make sure you always sleep. :S
<cowvarkian> wait, so the culties know he's tyler?
<SirGanjalf> He was living in his own Matrix.
<cowvarkian> or is there no cult
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: Another example is lines like 'Sometimes Tyler answered for me'.
<magmablock> Great. I'm a chronic insomniac who feels like his brain is a seperate person. I'm scared now.
<Pudge> wha
<cowvarkian> oh bollocks
<RosePetal> Hello.
<twilight_sprinkle> lol AJIsAwesome i need to do that more often :D
<Addict_Quick_Thinker> wahhhht
<RAWRity> Scoot-Scootaloo: "Tyler's words, coming out of my mouth."
<Addict_Quick_Thinker> shit
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I feel like I should try and sleep more often.
<Dken2021> hai RosePetal
<Envenomed> Dear princess Celestia: today I learned to never stay up for days
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah still "that which shall not be named" nice
<otakon> Sumica: why did you kick me?
<inkBot> cowvarkian i'd guess it's pretty hard to not notice it if you live with him
<Kreature> members EVERYWHERE
<otakon> He's in the loop
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03RAWRity: :O
<otakon> they're ALL in the loop
<cowvarkian> inkBot: meh, yeah
<Crainy> yaaay
<Mozdoc> So now the world goes to hell.
<Kurra> otakon, it's a dumb joke.....
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: Or when you see Tyler talk to the narrator whilst in the middle of having sex with Marla, she keeps saying things along the lines of 'Who's there?'
<DJ_Soru> Dat 808 drum is awesome
<Sumica> 00,10read the kick message then otakon
<RosePetal> Everyone is now crazy.
<Canadian_Brony> hi otakon
<Kurra> Sumica fffffffs XD
<DocSane> Marla! We have to stop my alternate personality's plot to start a terrorist attack!
<Reikim> Hoo boy
<otakon> Kurra: agreed and it's given me goddamn GRIEF ever since I heard of it.
<Kandarihu> So this epiphany of his has resulted in his being cured of MPD?
<otakon> Sumica: blast the joke
<IshSexiestPony> ohai bonies, what I miss
<thelonepony> hi Otakon
<Wirisme> lol

<RosePetal> They multiply.
<Dken2021> well that works

<twilight_sprinkle> so nobody can figure out that the hundreds of people with bruises are part of the fight club?
<otakon> hiya TOY_PON3 what's up mate?
<Freefall29> IshSexiestPony: check the newsletter and you'll see why

<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Eli: We only have the choice of two examples, both that are nearly as bad as the other?
<OperatorPony> HIS BALLS!
<Nittany_Discord> Crazy movie.

<Rosfox> OH SHIT
<Kreature> Not da balls!!!

<cachi01|phone> Pe
<otakon> oh God
<MrBen> Everlasting_Joy: xD Yes.
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken2: hard to say. On the one hand, the film's ending is more fitting with the tone, but it's lacking in closure. The novel's ending is more ambiguous, but it offers a better conclusion.
<twilight_sprinkle> uuuhh its not what you think
<IshSexiestPony> so the fight club controls even the police?
<pony_300> wow, so they know their boss is nuts
<TOY_PON3> dem balls

<Eli> DERPDERPDERPDERP: basically: YES. after the second world war these to economies had the greates following, and yeah, we had a choice between the two :P
<pony_300> otakon: I know(sorta) but I'm just wondering how that "new world" tyler created would play out

<AJIsAwesome> Lead salad. :D
<twilight_sprinkle> *lead
<RAWRity> prince-dari: eeyup.
<RosePetal> MAD SALAD.
<Wirisme> He had to think about it fdor a second
<giant> screw pants
<ScootaChicken2> RAWRity: Yeah, you're right. To be honest though, most people prefer the film's ending (including Palahniuk).
<silverturtle82> chaos salad
<WildRepublicGuard> lead salad?
<IshSexiestPony> Freefall29 what are you talking about?
<ScootaChicken2> Mostly because it's a fair bit happier.
<Kreature> *yells after him* you forgot your pants ...Sir
<MrBen> And he's still not wearing his pants. I love.
<Eli> DERPDERPDERPDERP: it's what the cold war was all about

<TOY_PON3> Tyler Durden is officially Project Mayhem(World)'s Most Wanted

<ScootaChicken2> Wrek: I like Edward Norton more tbh.
<TOY_PON3> this is pure gold.
<RosePetal> I wonder how that will look on camera.
<Kandarihu> Tyler is Jared's inner demon. The only way Jared can win is to realized that Tyler isn't real.
<pony_1758> LOL
<RAWRity> Wrek: do you have a thing for self-destructive lunatics?
<silverturtle82> well that escalated quickly

<RosePetal> Nows its flashforeward.
<Canadian_Brony> MrBen *ahem* "I'd like to thank the acadamy."
<Reikim> Anyway, there's some philosophical statement behind it about our consumerist society.
<TOY_PON3> Just fucking kill yourself
<otakon> MrBen: he's IMAGINING Durden dragging him while he's actually walking
<twilight_sprinkle> the ded 4th wall

<Tovler> Ed Norton should have installed antivirus. … /me deletes that.
<cachi01|phone> ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE END
<MrBen> otakon: Yeah, but if you saw the video feed during the "fight" you saw him being physically dragged across the ground by ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
<Addict_Quick_Thinker> is he pushing himseld
<Ersatz> How egalitarian.

<Kandarihu> He warned the police. A happy ending will result in them working their butts off to defuse those bombs.
<Shamroc> ohai Phase4
<TheMaster> this ending is actually way better than the novels

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> BaconMane: Michael Bay would cream himself

<Kandarihu> Kurra, darn right
<GabeMoist> FINISH HIM
<Canadian_Brony> ultimate "Fuck you" moment of the movie
<ScootaChicken2> Fight Club
<Ersatz> Gainax would be all over this.
<OohShiny> shit just got serious
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: agreed
<Kreature> Iminite crazy suicide
<Mozdoc> Awww, he doesn't want to watch the city go boom?
<Freefall29> what is the message this movie is trying to get at
<RosePetal> Our head.
<TOY_PON3> Ersatz: Ikr?
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: think about the fact that he's written al the stuff that's occured before hand. Does he strike you as the happy ending type of guy?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I still wish for that Lullaby movie to progress
<otakon> Ersatz: inb4 they do an animated remake
<Reikim> Something about consumerism.
<Ellieme> now remember kids, suicide is never the answer
<RosePetal> He's gonna commit sucicide.
<RAWRity> CrimsonPhoenix: maybe one day
<desertman2> Is he summoning his Persona?
<Reikim> And something about the illusion of freedom.
<Reikim> And something about soap.
<cowvarkian> Ellieme: except when it is
<SirGanjalf> Friends?
<twilight_sprinkle> aw friendship saves the day! except all the chaos and madness
<IshSexiestPony> Freefall29 that you shouldn't talk about fight club?
<RosePetal> Dats right no killing yourself. Think of ponies.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> do it!
<Eli> actually, it's you and you

<OohShiny> ded
<silverturtle82> ouch
<SirGanjalf> What's that smell?
<otakon> the picture is so dark I can't see it
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Double kill
<DocSane> He killed Tylor.
<Freefall29> IshSexiestPony: that, and how exactly blowing up credit card buildings will bring about economic freeding.
<TheMaster> he missed his brain
<Eli> ... that's why i would never use a gun to the head for suicide
<Kreature> Shooting his cheak
<TOY_PON3> dumb fuck
<GilDash> Frickin' ow.
<RosePetal> It's smoke.
<WildRepublicGuard> ಠ__ಠ
<giant> thats the only way to kill your imaginary friend
<Canadian_Brony> he didn't aim up
<Freefall29> freedom
<DaringDerpy> that was unnecessary
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> whoa
<otakon> cachi01|phone: you can survive getting shot in the head
<WildRepublicGuard> u ded
<Canadian_Brony> back of the neck
<RosePetal> Ded but they both ded.
<ScootaChicken2> cachi01|phone: He shot himself through the cheek, that'll hurt a fuckload, but chances are it won't kill you.
<MrBen> That's one hell of a lobotomy.
<prince-dari> Wut
<TOY_PON3> it's over. it's finally over
<Canadian_Brony> not the brain
<Ghosties> 04For a moment, I thought it was gonna turn out that Jack was actually the alter ego and Tyler was the real person
<otakon> cachi01|phone: he shot himself in a way that the bullet GRAZED his brain
<Canadian_Brony> "I'm okay."
<Jawn> OH MY GOD
<OohShiny> this was kind of a jigsaw game
<Jawn> HOW IS HE STILL ALIVE
<twilight_sprinkle> tis but a flesh wound
<Kurra> that gunshot take was done with a rubber head and an air blaster.
<silverturtle82> what
<OohShiny> he shot himself to save the city
<otakon> it destroyed his ear
<magmablock> he has a giant hole in his head and he's holding a gun. "Are you okay?"
<EspyLacopa> He's fiiiine.
<Ellieme> "nothing it's no problem"
<SirGanjalf> :D
<TOY_PON3> I'm all good
<Sumica> 00,10he blew his fucking mind
<RosePetal> He's alive but barely.
<OohShiny> totally SAW game
<otakon> and blew out the bottom of his chin
<DashWithRainbows> He'll walk it off.
<OohShiny> it's just a Flesh Wound
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> The back of his head has been blown open, how is he still talking and moving?!
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica . . . nice
<cachi01|phone> otakon i know there was a mexican soccer player who survived a shot to the head :)
<SirGanjalf> Yep, totally fine.
<Spectrum_Rush> tis but a scrstch
<pony_300> Ghosties: Huh, not a bad idea though....
<cowvarkian> tis just a flesh wound
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: ha
<otakon> it IS a flesh wound
<RosePetal> Tis but a scracth.
<twilight_sprinkle> guess he never actually shot himself?
<DaringDerpy> ignore the whole in my neck
<DocSane> Jawn: The bullet exited without hitting his brain or jugular.
<Hell2000> where are they what is going on
<AdamTheDuck> Hai Marla :D
<silverturtle82> yay
<SirGanjalf> Tis' just a gflesh wound
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> cowvarkian: touche
<Kreature> lol
<RosePetal> Oh hai Marla.
<SirGanjalf> *flesh
<giant> my face
<ScootaChicken2> Ghosties: Throughout the film you can see that Jack slowly changes his performance where he starts behaving a lot more like Tyler, whilst Tyler starts behaving more like Jack did at the beginning.
<Nittany_Discord> O.O
<Addict_Quick_Thinker> he is he still not passed out from shock
<ScootaChicken2> Which is pretty kewl.
<Canadian_Brony> "Blah blah blah you're a dick-oh my god your face."
<IshSexiestPony> how did he survive that?
<OohShiny> he shot himself to cure himself
<otakon> cachi01|phone: there was a construction worker that had a 3 foot section of pipe SKEWER his head and not only he was concious for it, he felt no pain and survived it.
<TOY_PON3> haha
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> look theres a giant smoking hole in my head
<Rustymeat> BOB?
<RosePetal> I shot myself.

<SirGanjalf> I'm Jacks rate of this movie.
<Rustymeat> Who directed this film?

<cachi01|phone> Im going to watch this movie again tomorrow =D

<Canadian_Brony> HIS NAME IS ROBERT PAULSON
<K_A> I love Pixies.
<silverturtle82> do we have to watch the credits?
<EleanorAwesome> shut up/10
<thelonepony> night andy
<twilight_sprinkle> 7.5/10. as far as movies go, it wasnt bad, but the philosophy was too simple to actually have any place in the real world
<p4ngya> 10/10 :)
<Eli> i would say 9.5/10, but i'm not supposed to talk about it.
<inkBot> bob/10
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> 1 hour until i get black mesa
<ScootaChicken2> GilDash: What did I tell you.
<Franek12354> I will be generous to rate it 9.75/10 :)
<Ghosties> 04The ending with the buildings blowing up and "Where Is My Mind" playing is...chills down my arms, man
<The_Browncoat> This part here, the credits? Best part of the whole film.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03We needed facts Silverscreen! Like how it's related to Calvin and Hobbes!
<Canadian_Brony> silverturtle82 yeah
<Kreature> One of the best movies ever made right here
<d3rb> DocSane, the only way to see it
<TOY_PON3> spacemonkey/10
<AlienWarhead> 5/10 I kind of liked it, but everything was far-fetched
<Phase4> ololololololololololo episode one's twist is epic
*SirGanjalf looks for his mind
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and that's watching the stream
<MLP_Brovakiin> goodnight peopel :)
<silverturtle82> I gave it a 7
<Ghosties> 04Holy fuck this film
<GilDash> ScootaChicken2: I was not disappointed. :)
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> 9/10, some parts I didn't care for but overall it was pretty great.
<OohShiny> this was insane
<NocturnalBlade> nite MLP_Brovakiin
<prince-dari> I'm still not sure what to make of it.
<pony_300> 9/10, still one of my favorite films that introduced me to one of the most powerful mindfucks I'd ever seen
<Gunthler> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
<Ghosties> 04I mean
<Gunthler> waaaaaaaaaaaaaat
<cowvarkian> AlienWarhead: thats the point
<Tovler> I'm glad someone who had been waiting over a year won a movie too. This needs to happen more often.
<Ghosties> 04It started out slow as hell
<TOY_PON3> Help. I have lost my mind
<Gunthler> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAT....
<twilight_sprinkle> bye MLP_Brovakiin
<Ghosties> 04And the pacing was really terrible for like the first thirty minutes
<OohShiny> and that kids, is How I met Myself
<Klumzeedragon> Ghosties: Glad you ended up liking it. You seemed so meeeeeh, about the beggining.
<silverturtle82> the sex scenes were a little much
<DocSane> It's an honest to God anarchist movie.
<giant> guess thats the only way to kill your imaginary friend then
<thelonepony> night MLP_Brovakiin
<RAWRity> Ghosties: you know what's fun? Watching it a 2nd time, and seeing all the subtle hints towards Tyler's existence. FOr instance: in the first 30 minute he's spliced into single frames of shots.
<Eli> why are we talking about fightclub? we're violating the first 2 rules
<Gunthler> waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat....
<flutterfan> every ones a cridic
<Anonthony> wut
<OohShiny> fightclub
<Ghosties> 04THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS, RAWRITY
<Crainy> this movie really was doing coke or something
<Wrek> 05also he didnt shoot his neck off as in where the spine connects to the skull. more like through the jaw otu on the side, missing the main artery
*Nittany_Discord jams to end tune.
<AJIsAwesome> Scoot-Scootaloo: Well,the only way I could see this related ot that is if this show wasa dark twist to the comic.
<shogipony> this movie is a moden classic
<Kurra> 1.1/10, not for any lack of technical execution or artistic merit, but 'cuz it made being mean and fighty look cool. :/
*TOY_PON3 missed the sex scenes
<WallDives> oshit, Ghosties.
<Ersatz> First time I've seen this, but I went in with spoilers and wow. So many clever details.
<TOY_PON3> I'm okay with thisd
<Freefall29> how many have actully played black mesa, not still downloading.
<giant> discord's favorites
<ScootaChicken2> So BaconMane, glad I forced you to watch that? :{
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> DocSane: It shows anarchy as a bad thing though, I think.
<Eli> ...screw you Sumica
<ScootaChicken2> *:P
<RAWRity> Ghosties: yup. The film makes had a lot of fun with this.
<Ghosties> 04But yeah, once Tyler finally made his onscreen debut like...the film just kept getting better and better
<Kandarihu> DocSane, I agree. The implications of the ending, I find especially ironic.
<Ersatz> This is Grimdark Pinkie Pie the movie.
<Wirisme> It grew on me
<Innate> can I say "fight club" now?
<DocSane> DERPDERPDERPDERP: Which I agree with.
<BaconMane> 0,5I wasn't forced, and you ruined the ending
<Sweet_Tea> thanks for the movie! :)
<silverturtle82> oh at the end of the credits already? cool
<SirGanjalf> Ghosties: My feelings exactly
<Shamroc> i dont know where to get it..
<AJIsAwesome> Scoot-Scootaloo: Plus, Hobbes is childish animation. Tyler is just insanity originating from insomnia.
<twilight_sprinkle> lol nope Innate . but you can say f¡ght club
<RosePetal> Where is my mind.
<Kurra> and I didn't spoil the movie! :D
<Jigglysaint> So basically this is like Me, Myself and Irene except darker and edgier?
<AJIsAwesome> *imagination*
<ScootaChicken2> BaconMane: Barely, you can see it coming a mile away.
<Kreature> First rule of fight club is *Buy some apples*
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc interwebs
<RanbowDash90> i give this movie 0/10
<Ghosties> 04Neat credits outro too
<p4ngya> Ghosties: im really surprised you haven't seen it yet
<Sweet_Tea> whats the next movie?
<DocSane> DERPDERPDERPDERP: Anarchy is NOT a viable social system.
<OohShiny> I wonder if Pinkie would shoot herself to kill her Crazy Self.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> DocSane: As should everyone, I'm just saying I don't think it was promoting anarchy.
<EleanorAwesome> Ponies time
<Freefall29> www.blackmesasource.com
<WallDives> dat kick script.
<Mozdoc> Those were some short credits.
<Wirisme> pony time!
*Shamroc slaps himself
<Kreature> oh come on. I didn't even say anything
<Canadian_Brony> I'm trying to think of an allusion for this film. I know there must be one, but I can't think of one
<Shamroc> OF COURSE
<flutterfan> PONI TIME
<OohShiny> Applebuck season
<twilight_sprinkle> and then ponies...
<GilDash> Mood whiplash time. XD
<Envenomed> POny time!!
<prince-dari> The majority of the film seems fairly pointless when you consider that the only thing that actually mattered throughout the whole film was the main character's state of mind
<flutterchu> PONIES :$
<Wirisme> I love this episode so much
<Sumica> 00,10perhaps later Eli, I have a headacke

<prince-dari> Silverscreen: Well you missed the build up of the relationship between the main character (for some reason I don't remember his name), and Tyler.
<Mozdoc> And pony just sliiiiides up from the bottom of the screen...
<EleanorAwesome> She can do it with the magic of friendship

<Kandarihu> Dangit, my mom found out that she was just targetted for a scam by someone who got control of a friend's e-mail address.
<Mishia> can i have a hug>
<Mishia> APPLES
<Freefall29> I've got every valve game released except dota 2 and cs:go
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: well it was partially to demonstrate the philosophy, although most of it was pretty pointless, true. especially since the whole idea wouldnt really work too well irl
<magmablock> @prince-dari: that's because the narrator has no name
<otakon> I'm a horrible person :( I forget who gave it to me.
<OohShiny> STAMEPD
<prince-dari> How could I not notice that he doesn't have a name?
<Jigglysaint> fight club + ponies = Buck Club
<prince-dari> What the actual fuck.
<EleanorAwesome> STAMPEEEEEED
<Eli> i probably shouldn't have turned up the volume that much just right now... i mean, i love the intro, but my lil bro is having a party in the house :/
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> prince-dari: His name was Tyler Dresden, he had no other name. That was pretty cool, the way they did that.
<Franek12354> INCOMING!!!
<silverturtle82> stampeed!
<Doctor> STAMPEEED
<GilDash> What if the main character's name actually *was* Tyler?
<Canadian_Brony> prince-dari holy shit. I didn't either!
<OohShiny> STAMPEEED
<Klumzeedragon> prince-dari: Mind fuck right?
<Canadian_Brony> NICE
<Jigglysaint> okay look the movie is over, joke is old
<Phase4> otakon, i know the feel bro /)
<RAWRity> Dari: We're never given the narrator's name. Not in the book either. Closest hint we're given is "Jack" and even that's suspect.
<Everlasting_Joy> Snake skin! Snake skin!
<ScootaChicken2> prince-dari: They deliberately avoided naming him throughout the movie.
<AlienWarhead> Can I say fight club now?
<SirGanjalf> GilDash: He was.
<silverturtle82> luna in the corner
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03His name was Calvin, duh :P
<sub06905> Moo!

<Eli> Pinkie is always silly
<Canadian_Brony> GUYS
<Innate> HIS NAME IS PINKIE PIE
<SirGanjalf> GilDash: And he wasn't entirely at the same time.
<Canadian_Brony> you cant' say the movie name
<AlienWarhead> GET AJ
<Mishia> Canadian_Brony: Frist rule of APPLES you dont talk about APPLES

<Canadian_Brony> prince-dari apparantely
<Franek12354> i got peanuts now :)
<AJIsAwesome> Pinkie Pie. Enjoying popcorn even when there's chaos around her. :D
<Reikim> I died for a sec there.
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: he placed the bombs and ignored the fact that he did, im guessing
<Reikim> Is everyone else dead now?
<otakon> Pony is small
<Mozdoc> Hello/Goodbye Winnona, as this is the only episode of season one you were in.
<Canadian_Brony> I'm still putting the entire film together
<OohShiny> Pinkie Pie is the element of Chaos
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: oh nvm, i misread
<Freefall29> Reikim: from what
<Pale_Horse> Heya everypony.
<Kreature> yay for random flags
<GilDash> SirGanjalf: No, I know what you mean. As the narrator he doesn't have a name though, so it's hard to say whether his real name is Tyler or that's just his other personality's own name.
<Dken2021> ello PaladinDrakkenwolf
<NocturnalBlade> hi Pale_Horse
<otakon> Mozdoc: but she shows up twice in S2
<WildRepublicGuard> dat apple flag
<cachi01|phone> AjIsAwesome i would enjoy the show also lol
<Doctor> MOOO
<Dken2021> ewr.. Pale_Horse
<silverturtle82> tongue
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Dken2021: hai
<ScootaChicken2> twilight_sprinkle: Basically, the insomnia was important, because whenever the Narrator's character was asleep, the Tyler persona took over.
<otakon> no
<silverturtle82> don't ya know
<Canadian_Brony> unfortunately, I won't be here for Euro Movie Night due to volunteer training
<Reikim> Internet shenanigans.
<twilight_sprinkle> cows are swiss, yah
<Kandarihu> Probably the one plothole is that Tyler gave him all kinds of knowledge, such as how to make soaps or bombs.
<Dken2021> well hey to you too PaladinDrakkenwolf
<kidzrul434> HELP MY PSYCHOSIS IS TRYING TO SEXUALLY HARASS ME! IS SEASON 3 OUT YET?!
<Innate> Where do the cows LIVE?
<Kreature> steer clear. Oh the puns
<Eli> i wonder why they have never made an issue of cows being stupid and a bit 'backwards' in mlp... they make such a fuss out of buffalos and derpy
<cowvarkian> implying cows/sheep are inferior creatures
<AlienWarhead> Dat pun
<Canadian_Brony> kidzrul434 no
<WildRepublicGuard> dat pun
<Mishia> :P
<AJIsAwesome> kidzrul434: It's out when it is.
<Kandarihu> Er, soap
<Pale_Horse> Sort of overslept. But at least there's more pony. :)

<Freefall29> Reikim: :D
<SirGanjalf> GilDash: Well, judging from his behavior after shooting himself, it doesn't seems like he killed Tyler. It looks that his personality and Tyler were connected again.

<Mozdoc> Applejack is entertaining you Rainbow! Aren't you entertained? :)

<OohShiny> RD, just fly
<Derpstar> Did she just concede to not being the best athlete?

<CrimsonPhoenix> woah what happened to the voice now
<flutterchu> FUCK YOU
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> What would even be in a Pony Zoo???
<CrimsonPhoenix> All I can hear now are horse noise
<Eli> flutterfan: i don't think there's a "best ship" some better some less. it all matters how you lay out the caracters. but with the mane 6, who have a very defined character, writers have to be carefull. to be honest, i think Rarity is straight
<flutterchu> NO I DONT
<GilDash> Argh! That ringing gets right in my ears. >_<
<Crippler> Oh AJ, you crazy redneck.
<Dken2021> there are zoos?
<Bronysith> why is applejacks only episode too damn good
<Crainy> Twilight should have used some Optimus Prime philosophie on this issue...
<OohShiny> there are zoos in equestria
<AlienWarhead> Tyler
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Whats in their zoos?
<twilight_sprinkle> she can do a 90 degree angle turn after a sonic rainboom, but cant redirect after being flown off a seasaw
<OohShiny> now that's interesting
<Canadian_Brony> twilight_sprinkle she wasn't prepared and was most likely unable to use her wings which would require focus, even for Rainbow
<AJIsAwesome> There're zoos in Equestria?
<magmablock> Do pony zoos have humans?
<Freefall29> Bronysith: its not her only epside
<sub06905> kelp
<silverturtle82> duh
<AlienWarhead> OohShiny made up of lesser creatures
<Canadian_Brony> gah, Kelp is awful
<cachi01|phone> AjIsAwesome humans
<Bronysith> Freefall29: yea it is
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> DERP 6_9
<twilight_sprinkle> Canadian_Brony: i would think using wings to them is just like us using legs and arms
<sub06905> she needs Kelp Shakes
<silverturtle82> kill kelp with fire
<Bronysith> Freefall29: the other one is a derpy episode
<Kreature> Slavery is magic

<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Derpstar: That's awesome, I've always heard about what a great guy he is.
<EleanorAwesome> Well good night I suppose?

<thelonepony> night EleanorAwesome
<silverturtle82> good night
<AJIsAwesome> night EleanorAwesome
<EleanorAwesome> OH for celestia's sake
<Rex_Mundi> Uh, so here is a question, why is Pinky Pies depressed alter ego known as Pinkamena? isnt that just Pinkie Pies full first name? Its not like Pinky ever stoped being Pinkamena.
<EleanorAwesome> Stop it
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Derpstar: I bet there were a lot of them over there.
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: It's nice that you bring that up. I never liked that to begin with.
<Klumzeedragon> sub06905: I'd really like too cause of stuff. But I suppose that AJIsAwesome is right. I would be able to go, but then I wouldnt have money for other things... Oh the ponymanity!
<MrBen> Rex_Mundi: Just a fanon term, and the fact that depressed Psycho Pinkie is supposed to be, fanon-wise, completely personality different than regular old Pinkie.
<Derpstar> Not many today (Friday) but there's a MLP panel tomorrow
<Sumica> 00,10it's because people need to label things to reffrence them later
<Kurra> dunno if i wanna see 2nd movie.
<Ghosties> 04I'm still reeling from Fight Club
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, perhaps she went by that name when her mane was straight. And when she feels down, her mane also goes straight.
<flutterchu> tombstone is best OC
<EleanorAwesome> ^
<flutterchu2> flutterchu: indeed
<kinixys> Pretty good eh, Ghosties?
<OohShiny> never saw tombstone's OC
<Final_Boss_Desco> ?
<Ghosties> 04Holy shit, was it ever
<EleanorAwesome> Whats the slangs
<AJIsAwesome> I wouldn't call Pinkamena "psycho" or "crazy", just depressed and lost.
<EleanorAwesome> watch*
<Kandarihu> When she's down or mentally unbalanced, she's straight-maned Pinkamena Diane Pie. When she's happy and fun to be around, she's messy-maned Pinkie Pie.
<AlienWarhead> hi guys is that the Sumica OC pony
<AJIsAwesome> But hey, that's my opinion.
<sub06905> Klumzeedragon: well if you do have more important things to take care of, then AJIsAwesome is right it can wait
<d3rb> tomorrow will be the best day of Ghosties life, his breakfast will taste beter than any meal we have ever eatten
<Klumzeedragon> Ghosties: Buy a copy so you can see it all over again. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> so what was crazier, Requiem for a dream or Fight club?
<MrBen> AJIsAwesome: Agreed, but other people just take the idea and run with it.
<Wirisme> back :)
<Wirisme> just in time!
<flutterchu> oh boy
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, you ready for the insanity?
<Petrified_Discord> Dun dun da da
<Rex_Mundi> Kandarihu: I dont like that explanation. She is Pinkamena Diane Pie aka Pinkie Pie, no matter her mental state.
<AJIsAwesome> MrBen: True, and I can understand that people do that as a joke but some people take it WAY too far. :|
<Klumzeedragon> sub06905: In between jobs right now... :D So I suppose I need to save every little bit I can.
<silverturtle82> storm incoming!
<JESmith71> B Movie Begins
<Silverscreen> 01,11DA-DA-DAAA DA-DA-DA-DAAAA DA-DA-DA-DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA :D
<MrBen> AJIsAwesome: Hence why we have a fanon that, on the general whole, assumes Straight-Hair Pinkie is 180º different than Regular Poofy Pinky.
<Silverscreen> 01,11...C'mon, i'm not the only one who sings it.
<WildRepublicGuard> -WildRepublicGuard awakens-
<MrBen> AJIsAwesome: Ah. Heh. But, yeah.

<OohShiny> I like this soundtrack
<Sumica> 00,10this movie is all about sunday
<pony_9742> DADADA
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, then I guess you can think of it as a line between idealism and realism.
<Buytoast> what's this? is that that world fo warcraft movie?
<Final_Boss_Desco> Let's get ready for Earth's destruction.
<flutterfan> MADE IT
<MrBen> Oh.

<AJIsAwesome> Hi, XylemTube :)
<flutterchu> does this mean bad movie
<silverturtle82> ice...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03It looks like this movie sounds pretty cool!
<AlienWarhead> The movie that proves Al Gore wrong
<flutterfan> dash
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> It didn't get too many good reviews, even if the budget was pretty high.
<richfiles> It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine
<WildRepublicGuard> ello XylemTube
<Sumica> 00,10thought you hate those Kandarihu
<RosePetal> lol this movie is so bad it's good.
<Klumzeedragon> Scoot-Scootaloo: That pun...
<Wirisme> It's just a stupid disaster movie
<Sumica> 00,10dohoho Scoot-Scootaloo
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> It's not that bad at all, not good though either. Then again I don't care for disaster movies anyway.
<Wirisme> but whatever
<OohShiny> anyone likes the soundtrack as much as me?
<SirGanjalf> I still like TDAT more than Independence Day...
<silverturtle82> haven't seen it in a while
<XylemTube> This movie was okish
<XylemTube> ISH
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu: or some Mystery Pony Theather 6000 <----- Get it?
<Petrified_Discord> Wirisme: Stupid good or stupid bad?
<Doctor> WHAT FUCKING MOVIE?!
<Kandarihu> Sumica, I saw this movie before.
<Silverscreen> 01,11Icebergs. Is this Titanic 2?
<silverturtle82> oh great
<Spectrum_Rush> Scoot-Scootaloo: there is something wrong with that grammar, you're lucky Meanwhile isn't here
<Wirisme> It's not that bad actually
<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma, hehe
<AlienWarhead> Scoot-Scootaloo chill out chicken boy
<sub06905> Silverscreen: :D
<Metronome> BEST MOVIE EVVVVVEEEEERRRRRR!!!!!!!!1
<MrBen> AJIsAwesome: One last point--keep in mind that Party of One has been the ONLY time we have EVER seen Straight Hair Pinkie.
<Klumzeedragon> Doctor: THIS FUCKING MOVIE! :)
<kinixys> Day before tomorrow.
<RosePetal> I saw this movie when I was in Middle School.
<flutterchu> i know what movie i would stream if i were streaming
<OohShiny> Silverscreen: no, it's Ice Age 5
<Sumica> 00,10titanic 2 electric Scoot-Scootaloo
<DocSane> This is what I'd class an irresposible environmentalism.
<Ghosties> 04Fluttershy likes the nice score
<magmablock> In my opinion: it's a good movie, just as long as you don't take it too seriously
<AJIsAwesome> MrBen: True.
<DocSane> It claims to preach a message I agree with, but in such a stupid way that it damages its own cause.
<Sumica> 00,10long movies tonight
<Dark92Enigma> NO, it's the LAND BEFORE TIME XXVI!!!!!!!!!
<EonMaster> Silverscreen, nope, Titanic the Animated Movie
<Doctor> GUYS WHAT IS THE DAMN MOVIE?! IM FREAKIN OUT OVER HIA
<Sumica> 00,10both of them over 2 hours
<kinixys> This scene could use some Pegasai flying about.

<Petrified_Discord> MURICCA
<Wirisme> Did the lottery happen yet?
<Dark92Enigma> AMERICA!!!!!!! FUCK YEAH
<MrBen> Tovler: I'm tempted to ask why we didn't just use that version here to begin with.
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: As long as we stay entertained, no one's complaining. Long movies are great. :D
<flutterchu> now im confused
<Spectrum_Rush> ntartica!

<DocSane> The ozone hole is gonna eat us all!
<Petrified_Discord> Better worry
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> NOAA
<AlienWarhead> I never liked 2012 a lot because this movie is cooler
<Klumzeedragon> flutterchu: Why?
<Wirisme> Okie
<Mozdoc> Well I can see the reason this movie exists. Humans are in Antarctica.
<Nittany_Discord> This is the Titanic 3. In this movie, the US launches Titanics all over the world. In response, there's a massive ice age. Then iceburgs go and sink the Titanics.
<Dken2021> it's....something
<Kandarihu> Yes, the illegal American occupation of Antartica
<sub06905> the windagos must fave caused all this snow
<Tovler> 2012 got slow in the 3rd act.
<Ghosties> 04^Brilliant Nitt

<EonMaster> i'd pay to see that Nittany_Discord
<AlienWarhead> SirGanjalf SHAAWWWNN!!
<OohShiny> Antartica is the land of hatred, because of all the windigoes
<Dark92Enigma> Nittany_Discord: Makes sense! :)
<Mozdoc> Derpy broke the world.
<Everlasting_Joy> The drilling wouldn't cause the ice cracking.
<Doctor> THEY DUG TOO DEEP!
<Kandarihu> NO BLOOD FOR ICE
<OohShiny> ded

<Nittany_Discord> It would make an awesome Sci-Fi Channel flick.
<Petrified_Discord> HOLY FUCK
<flutterchu> O_O
<AlienWarhead> 6_9
<Mozdoc> Told you, here's the reason this movie exists. Fucking humans, in fucking Antarctica.
<silverturtle82> no prob
<OohShiny> this wouldn't really happen in antartica
<Wirisme> careful derpy
<OohShiny> only in north pole
<MrBen> "I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING." <ded>

<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Nittany_Discord: It basically is, only with a bigger budget and "better" actors.
<Dark92Enigma> Get it? because I'm ICE! VAINILLA ICE!
<EonMaster> how were they drilling through open air?

<Kandarihu> Whatever. All that the governments of the world need to know is that it doesn't matter whether the Earth is getting extremely hot or extremely cold, but humanity having any standard of living is responsible, so the only way to save the ecosystem is to screw the people.
<flutterchu> a 3d pony game

<XylemTube> Futbol
<SirGanjalf> AlienWarhead: What makes me a good Demoman? Swords!

<Metronome> NOOO:'(
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah, its Japan
<MrBen> Petrified_Discord: And this is why we should be glad Pokemon battles don't exist IRL
<DocSane> Kandarihu: If the warm water currents in the oceans were disrupted, it WOULD cause a massive temp drop for Europe and the US.
<Tovler> more like Mushy Mushy
<Spazturtle> "are you ok?"
<Dark92Enigma> Scoot-Scootaloo: bA Dumm Tss

<Final_Boss_Desco> In a deleted scene, Taka was not talking to his wife. Instead, he was talking to a minor character we'll see later.
<Kandarihu> And the movie itself was a disaster. DISASTERCEPTION

<name> oh fudge
<Petrified_Discord> Someone call Batman!
<Sumica> 00,10now for the lets destroy any landmarks we can think of bit
<Dark92Enigma> NOT THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN
<Nittany_Discord> This is commonplace for Oklahoma City.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Idiots
<flutterchu> pewdiepie: WHAT THE FUCK IZ GOING ON HERE!!!!!!!!!!!
<Mozdoc> Ha ha! Look, Hollywood just played with itself, erasing its own sign.
<XylemTube> why is there so many twisters?
<Ghosties> 04And unless humans manage to find a way to leave the Earth and colonize other planets we're eventually going to die out because of the eventual extremities that will shape Earth

<CK|Catnap> Dear god, it's Twister all over again
<NullRadix> Ghosties: colonize other planets or become masters of our own
<flutterchu> THIS IS HORRIFYING
<Science_Brony> also, twister + twister does not equal bigger twister

<sub06905> we fight weather with tons of missles and guns
<Dark92En|gma> TO THA MOOOOOOOOOOOONA BEE-YTCH
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> We should take the Earth... and push it, somewhere else!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Scoot-Scootaloo: I like your thinking
<name> hey guys the moon is made out of cheese
<Tovler> The "Son"
<Reikim> *insert generic hello here*
<Science_Brony> Ghosties impossible. A twister that size would only be F2 max. Anything else would have an eye, but it would last a couple seconds maybe. The tornadoes' size and damage do not relate repectively.
*Quick_Thinker makes an alternate universe machine and goes to Equestria to ride it out
<Reikim> Oh my god this is The Day after Tomorrow.
<silverturtle82> *sigh* stupid people
<Reikim> And we have Nitt here for this.
<thelonepony> name have you found woona?
<Science_Brony> Ghosties in other words, this wouldn't happen and it wouldn't have an eye
<sub06905> inb4 rabble rabble
<Wirisme> Less talk more explosions
<Science_Brony> HOWEVER
<Reikim> All meteorologists, feel free to make fun of this movie.
<Nittany_Discord> Trying to get into the NWS. They won't take me :<
<Science_Brony> this is true
<WildRepublicGuard> *digs underground base made of lead n steel*
<silverturtle82> exactly!
<Silverscreen> 01,11So he's saying we need to dump a shitload of salt into the ocean.
<Nittany_Discord> Reikim: Sure.
<Science_Brony> the current CAN change the weather
<Sumica> 00,10weather will continue to happen?!
<Derpstar> science babble!

<Malk> Sumica YES
<Wirisme> Oh. Mah. God.
<twilight_sprinkle> NUKE THE WEATHER
<DocSane> The climate is shifting...RIGHT NOW!
<silverturtle82> does not compute
<Quick_Thinker> NUKE THE SUN
<name> ok were having tea time right now
<Ninjazz> SCRAMBLE THE JETS.
<Nittany_Discord> Like how a climate shift happens on a synoptic time scale?
<Wirisme> Send global warming to the moon
<WildRepublicGuard> NUKE THE BUFFER
<Sumica> 00,10call in the weather ponies
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: I remember hearing...the only accurate moment in this movie is in the beginning, when he jumps the ice chasm. All meteorologists are totally that hardcore.
<Ninjazz> Let's show the weather who's boss.
<name> HEY IM IN THE MOON
<Wirisme> RD would solve this in 10 seconds flat
<CrazyHippie> Buts it's a SCIRNTIFIC THEORY!
<pony_300> NO. :C
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> in 48 hours theyre all gonna be dead
<Lil> Freaking windigoes
<OohShiny> send the moon to the sun
<Dark92En|gma> Silverscreen: Next thing we know, is that we need................ a lot of fish
<Silverscreen> 01,11A theory that, for the past 24 hours, has been proven true with one disaster after another. Stupid f**k.
<Thrackerzod> let them all die please
<Quick_Thinker> SCIENE IS CLEARLY THE ANSWER HERE
<Thrackerzod> please?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> slap
<DocSane> The head of NOAA is trying to protect his budget...from CHENEY!!!!!
<Science_Brony> Silverscreen that would do nothing. Too much water, not enough salt to dump. We'd have to freeze the water, which is what the climate shift is doing.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> 20%?
<Kandarihu> Reikim, First rule of The Day after Tomorrow, you do not talk about The Day after Tomorrow. Second Rule of The Day after Tomorrow, you do not talk aobut The Day after Tomorrow. Third rule of The Day after Tomorrow, you do NOT talk about The Day after Tomorrow!
<AlienWarhead> Lil too many haters

<Quick_Thinker> peter why should we care for you
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Wait, so we don't talk about Sunday?
<Wirisme> aw :(
<Reikim> Quick_Thinker: He has cancer. It's not debatable.
<SirGanjalf> Oh hey, emotional token
<OohShiny> damn, good memory
<Kandarihu> Dovah, Fight Club
<Quick_Thinker> thats the ultimate question
<sub06905> The pegasi are attacking earth!
<twilight_sprinkle> awww, so sweet.... and then a car crashed through the wall
<Dovah> ......... Kandarihu
<Science_Brony> Dovah Day After Tomorrow. AKA, some science fact, some science fiction, and me pointing out which is which.
<Science_Brony> Dovah hence my name
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Dovah: Well right now it has leveled up to just 'Day of Tomorrow'
<Thrackerzod> Quick_Thinker remeber to give monie to envoromentalist so they can save you from global warming, instead of real scientist who want to research plasma enegry
<DocSane> People complain about ID4, but it's so much more enjoyable than Roland Emmerich's later disaster films.
<name> ...
<Nittany_Discord> Desalinization would shut down the Gulf Stream/NAC, but the resultant cooling won't be this severe.
<Sumica> 00,10ok guys stop that, it's not funny
<OohShiny> war of the worlds next?
<cachi01> guys i have a pc for just 3 hours so GIVE ME IDEAS!!! (i already played slender lol)

<Nittany_Discord> And it would affect Europe first.
<Dovah> This looks more like catigory 7 than day after tomarrow, i has both so...
<Tovler> Weasley Twins did this schtick better
<DocSane> Dark92Enigma: So do I.
<Quick_Thinker> real scientists CAN MAKE ME MY PORTAL TO EQUESTRIA SO FUCK THE ENVIROMENT IF I CAN GET MY PONIEs
<Dovah> really were is all the ICE?!

<Malk> DocSane hes my distant relative

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> He's going Quail Hunting
<Science_Brony> I love how we are mentioned twice: Newfoundland has a storm that's shown on the news and we're mentioned along side Australia

<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Yeah, 'Murican Landmark destroyed = cheap emotional reaction for film. It is known.
<Mozdoc> Painful foreshadowing.
<otakon> Reikim: I don't care if you think this movie is shit, it's not.
<Reikim> Science_Brony: Haha, just joking...everyone else knows that Great Britain is the centre :P
<cachi01> huzza for pc!
<flutterchu> WE NEED A BRONYSTATE APP
*Kurra compares everyone arguing here to Hitler
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> And video games actually.
<Reikim> otakon: ...I'm not saying that.
<Malk> DocSane Its not so bad

<pony_3817> Bilbo baggens?
<Nittany_Discord> That is Bilbo. I didn't realize that until now.
<Science_Brony> instant freezing does NOT mean it will be perfectly preserved. Even so, that would require tempertures lower than Liquid Nitrogen
<Tovler> The movie has way too much TV and Phone Calls. It needs more googling scenes.
<Silverscreen> 01,11My god, that is Bilbo baggins. Thanks, Ghosties. XD
<Ghosties> 04Yep, that's Bilbo
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Kandarihu: I've only seen the first season so far, but yeah Big Ben. They use British landmarks I assume?

<Silverscreen> 01,11they're f**ked
<PonyStationVita> oh no no the ice age\
<AlienWarhead> DUN DUN
<Reikim> Those are British pilots, of course.

<Everlasting_Joy> How can there be a cold hurricane?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> You can tell he's British, he said bloody.
<Quick_Thinker> isnt the eye spposed to be the safeiest part of the storm
<Appleshine> going down
<silverturtle82> DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
<Spectrum_Rush> THEY WERE FROZEN TODAY!!!
<Quick_Thinker> isnt the eye spposed to be the safeiest part of the storm
<Sumica> 00,10and we are not to some how belive they are being exposed to the vacume of space
<Kandarihu> DERPDERPDERPDERP, it's British, so it's seen from a British perspective. This movie is American, so it's seen from an American point of view.
<DocSane> Riiiiight
<Derpstar> Welcome to Canada!
<PonyStationVita> aw this movie
<SirGanjalf> Baggins has fooled the Eye of Sauron already. Eye of the storm is nothing for him.
<Tovler> should had the heater on.
<Thrackerzod> im sorry thats not possible
<Nittany_Discord> You crashed into the storm.
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Reikim> ^^
<Mozdoc> I feel no emotion or sympathy for any characters in this movie. I just don't care.
<Appleshine> don't open that!
<Kurra> Oh I know, I bet it's volcanic ash!
<SirGanjalf> inb4 I WAS FROZEN TODAY
<PonyStationVita> damn
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> human popsicle
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Kandarihu: Yeah, I know. Still, I don't like national landmarks getting destroyed for a lazy emotional response, video games do this all the time too.
<Wirisme> now ded
<Quick_Thinker> yeah sure
<Kurra> whoah. o.o
<Dark92En|gma> mythbusters would call BULLSHIT ON THAT ONE
<AlienWarhead> At that point would they freeze to death?
<Aircrafter> Screw your internal body heat
<CK|Catnap> lol nope
<Science_Brony> Derpstar more like Canada welcomes you
<magmablock> SubZero wins
<Aircrafter> I'm mother nature.
<Derpstar> But what about the Queen?
<Dark92En|gma> I WAS FROZEN TODAY
<WildRepublicGuard> Mozdoc: wow
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> He got a chilling reception.
<Kurra> O_O;;;;
<Science_Brony> dem bad puns
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Man, those guys chilled out

<Kandarihu> DERPDERPDERPDERP, yeah, I understand.
<flutterchu> http://derpy.me/Mtkf7
<CK|Catnap> Pretty sure that's IMPOSSIBLE.
<Nittany_Discord> And when did scientists start using F?
<Dark92En|gma> DERPDERPDERPDERP: His acting was cold enough
<Science_Brony> SUCH TERRIBLE PUNS
<Reikim> Oh dem puns
<SirGanjalf> He's so cool
<PonyStationVita> lol nice puns/memes
<Final_Boss_Desco> These people should have frozen instantly. Emmerich himself said that in the commentary.
<Malk> Thank gawd I dont live in england
<Mozdoc> This movie is just so full of bull...
<DocSane> We need the internet...NOW!
<Ghosties> 04Mountain, Gandalf. Mountains!

<Wirisme> It's a landcane!
<PonyStationVita> fluttershy...
<silverturtle82> Oh the fuel lines are freezing? I know I'll stick my head out of the door!
<JESmith71> DERPDERPDERPDERP: Yeah I remember that used to work on me. Seeing the White House blow up in ID4 freaked me out as a kid but not so much anymore
<Kandarihu> But you gotta admit, it was done well in Planet of the Apes
<Sumica> 00,10so it's a hisacane?
<Kurra> We must go through the mines.... of Moriah!
<Ninjazz> It's everything!
<Nittany_Discord> Funny. Hurricane cores are warmer than the surrounding atmosphere.
<Ghosties> 04I tell you, this is all a nasty plot by the dastardly Mr. Freeze!
<Dken2021> terrible wheather
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Dark92Enigma: His acting was wooden, almost frozen stiff.
<WildRepublicGuard> rock u like a hurricane
<Derpstar1> Chat derped, did I miss anything insightful?
<AlienWarhead> Silverscreen you will warm up to the ice jokes
<SirGanjalf> It's a HURRicane

<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Kandarihu: Certainly, it's effective when done well, that's for sure.
<Kurra> YOURICANE. Made just for you. By you.
<Dark92En|gma> DocSane: If this movie was made by TED TURNER, then i guess so
