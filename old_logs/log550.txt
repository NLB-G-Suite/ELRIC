<Marx> Easily one of the best fanworks I've ever seen.
<richfiles> Cuz we saw the original movie... All our derps 6_9 were expressed on it
<DocSane> Because most of us have seen 2001 and know the story'
<Mozdoc> Lots of talent around here.
<otakon> Marx: agreed
<Biglaw> Nittany_Discord ooki doki loki

<Mutterguy> I was in high chool when that came out...
<Kencolt> Sumica: I suspect a LOT of people fell into our trap like that-- you watch something like this and figure, "Well, heck-- I need to find out what this is ABOUT."

<SpadeMagnes[R]> What is this clip from?
<richfiles> Jut looked at the Spitfire comic... Wildfire... Spitfire... Geez! What are these ponies made of? Fe2O3 and 2Al???
<Reikim> SpadeMagnes[R]: LotR
<Lightning-Quill> My friend was a brony. I thought him odd for watching MLP but he always has his reasons for everything. Watched it became a brony after I found out what a brony was
<dinky> what the fuck
<DocSane> Galadrial freaks out
<SparklyWaffles> ;)
<Sumica> 00,10SpadeMagnes[R], it's from lord of the rings
<Lightning-Quill> Kill it with the sun
<Dr_Fumbles> MahBoi777: Can't complain. Trying to learn Java, and it's hard...
<Biglaw> Rarity deserved id
<Biglaw> it
<DocSane> Rarity was awful in that episode.
<Vereox> First Step into Bronyhood: Denial.
<MirrorImage> Dr_Fumbles: first programming language?
<Biglaw> who who
<Chaser> WOOO HOO HOO HOO HOO
<MahBoi777> Dr_Fumbles: ah, well good!
<Biglaw> whoooooo are you
<wicked> this is funny:D
<Sumica> 00,10all I know about java is I dont like the taste of it.
<Dr_Fumbles> Yep, I am also trying C#
<Chaser> awww....
<DocSane> First step into Bronyhood is watching an episode and wondering why people like this so much.
<MirrorImage> can't say i'm fond of Java either, but i can BS my way through it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Just as planned
<Lightning-Quill> I don't drink coffe :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Hah
<MahBoi777> lmao
<Tassadork> java's terrible, unfortunately...
<Ponies47> Lightning-Quill: Yay! I'm so glad that classmate of mine convinced me to watch an episode! Who knows maybe if he didn't maybe I would just watched an episode anyways :P
<adasdad> lol
<Lightning-Quill> Deathnote
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: (\
<Biglaw> XD
<noname> lol
<adasdad> poor celestia
<MirrorImage> Dr_Fumbles: if possible, you might consider trying a different language first to get the feel of coding down
<MahBoi777> rollin rollin rollin
<Sumica> 00,10I kinda regret i did't join the fandom sooner.
<wicked> cows
<Reikim> Don't we all, Sumi?
<Dr_Fumbles> MirrorImage: I'm considering it... any suggestions?
<Dark_Horst> actually, java is formidable. it'S just a slow fuck
<MirrorImage> i started with Visual Basic and it works out great for me
<Lightning-Quill> What I like about MLP is that is a diamond in the rough
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i didnt
<otakon> um
<otakon> Lightning-Quill: wrong euphemism there
<MirrorImage> it's extremely plain-english, so there's less thinking about syntax and more on actually learning logic
<MahBoi777> Crash
<otakon> Lightning-Quill: but I know what you mean
<Biglaw> wall
<otakon> splat
<MirrorImage> (and no SEMICOLONS)
<Tassadork> Dr_Fumbles: python has its charms, definitely easier to pick up than java
<Ponies47> flyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
<adasdad> ;
<Vereox> That mountain must be in the Top-Percentage to stop Rainbow Dash.
<otakon> !
<Biglaw> Dat sound!
<MirrorImage> Though C# might do as well
<Ponies47> !
<Dr_Fumbles> Alright, I'll look into it, thx
<Biglaw> FWIM
<otakon> !!
<MirrorImage> never used that
<MahBoi777> Game Over
<otakon> GAME OVER
<wicked> taLK TO ME DUDE
<Vereox> Nice goin' Twi.
<adasdad> ;(
<Ponies47> !
<Reikim> MirrorImage: C# is Microsoft's version of Java.
<Ponies47> wicked: NO! :[
<otakon> TWILIGHT? TWILIGHT?! TWILIGHT!!!!!
<MahBoi777> oh man I remember dat show
<MirrorImage> fair enough then - i return to my original suggestion
<Biglaw> nope
<Lightning-Quill> I mean in better words it is a show that is in essence good in terms of values over other shows that lack being even remotely good. Most are just brutish
<Chaser> Be very afraid
<Biglaw> XD
<otakon> God, this opening theme STILL creeps me out
<MahBoi777> ikr
<Tassadork> MirrorImage: yeah, it's pretty much true
<Chaser> lol
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Aw
<Chaser> LOL
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Blaugh
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Biglaw> XD
<otakon> God, the quality alone jumped SO much between 1 and 2
<Dr_Fumbles> I was originally trying to learn Java to mod Minecraft, but now I can see myself in a programming career
<MirrorImage> Dr_Fumbles: random question, but what program are you using to learn Java?
<Xaiden> Wtf is up with Pinkie Pie
<wicked> HEY TOM!
<Biglaw> mmumummumuuumuuu
<dinky> appleblooms face... xD
<Vereox> She's high.
<otakon> Xaiden: like what?
<Vereox> On.
<adasdad> prefer pinkie's brew, thianks
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Heh
<Vereox> Cupcakes.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> okay Bronies, I got a hangover to go sleep off
<Dr_Fumbles> MirrorImage: Eclipse
<SpadeMagnes[R]> go go pony rangers
<Chaser> POWAH RANGAHS
<dinky> So relevent...
<Xaiden> How much longer is this?
<MirrorImage> good, was going to suggest that
<otakon> Xaiden: she's a hyper active pony of improbably possiblities.
<Sumica> 00,10alot of that goes from upgrading the hardware they used otakon
<dinky> o.o
<Lightning-Quill> Main Reason: It makes me happy
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well I'm going to go to bed when this ends
<wicked> im equestria clown. laugh at me:D
<CrimsonPhoenix> HELLOOOO Bronystate
<otakon> Sumica: I figured, plus using better qualtiy scenes and the general improvement of the animation fo S2 as well
<otakon> hiya CrimsonPhoenix
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'm gonna go curbstomp Whitney
<MahBoi777> hi CrimsonPhoenix

*Spectrum_Rush pokes CrimsonPhoenix
<dinky> xD
<Pale_Horse> Dat LAzytown...
<CrimsonPhoenix> What's up in da web
<MahBoi777> Lol
<Reikim> otakon: But the key ingredient was that the team actually loved what they were doing.
<otakon> God Lazytown
<otakon> I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT SHOW
<Dr_Fumbles> dis song
<Ponies47> HELLOOOO CrimsonPhoenix :P
<otakon> and this is my least favorite skit
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon it's a show about GETTING ACTIVE
<Sumica> 00,10well they could not do much cause if they had to much in a clip you got rendering errors like with the pony with only one eye in the best night ever.
<otakon> if only bc I find this "song" utterly repugnant.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and there's a villain that doesn't like that
<SpadeMagnes[R]> This seems to fit
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: then why call it LAZYTOWN?
*Vereox just testing.
<Dr_Fumbles> Sumica: that was... weird...
<CrimsonPhoenix> so he goes and make it lazy again
<MirrorImage> well, i'm out for the night
<Dage4> Back
<CrimsonPhoenix> well try
<Reikim> otakon: Irony.
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: and have the weird puppet mask people
*Dage4 is derping
*Vereox pulls out GBA.
<Dr_Fumbles> MirrorImage: G'night
<otakon> night MirrorImage sleep well
*Dage4 slaps admins
<SpadeMagnes[R]> CrimsonPhoenix: That seems like a very poor villain plot
<sub06905> o.o
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah the animation went way up
<Mutterguy> in fairness. Teletubbies is fucking weird too when you thin about it
<otakon> Sumica: eeyup
*Vereox plays Sonic Battle.
<Sumica> 00,10such as the bit in leson Zero
<CrimsonPhoenix> but there's a hero, in a zeppelin, coming down to put the kids active again :D
<wicked> supppppppppppppp..... OH sorry i got stage frite. not a coment just a joke
<Mutterguy> *think

<hen3ry> bad spike is better than no spike at... nevermind
<Reikim> Proof positive that the saxaphone is the sexiest instrument around.
<richfiles> How sad is it that I know the bit that will come up next... EVERY TIME
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: odd song, but good beat
<Kencolt> Sumica: Tio be fair, Studio B was trying to do something no-one ever really had tried-- to use Flash to make GOOD animation with a decent budget. It took a while to work out some of the kinks. Thankfully. THose kinks gave us Derpy.
<Xaiden> I want that a my TF2 spray now
<Xaiden> damn awesome
<Sumica> 00,10eeeyup
<Reikim> Kencolt: I thought Derpy was an intentional joke?
<otakon> Kencolt: and it came out GOOD too

<otakon> MOLESTIA: keep your plot to yourself
<MOLESTIA> SPACE
<SpadeMagnes[R]> SPAAAAAAAAACE!
<Reikim> otakon: There was an interview where someone confessed they put the crosseyes in on purpose.

<Unnr_NoPower> Reikim, because I am in brown out conditions, and my desktop which I was connected on crashed but the client didn' t disconnect
<adasdad> wicked just walked over and started punching me, no joke
<Unnr_NoPower> and I have been too lazy to ghost and reconnect
<Reikim> Unnr_NoPower: Ah, makes sense. No worries then.
<Lunar_Brony> Unnr_NoPower ugh, that can get annoying

<Lunar_Brony> Unnr_NoPower I would never, EVER, survive those conditions

<adasdad> disregard anything i say for a while
<Unnr_NoPower> Tolver 28 C currently here
<Lunar_Brony> last time I was pulled away from internet for more than 3 days, all I did was sit around and talk to myself for hours. Good and bad, however
<Dr_Fumbles> Air conditioning ftw!

<Dr_Fumbles> Reikim: You didnt look up, look again
<Reikim> Unnr_NoPower: There was no way that was unintentional.
*Reikim looks up
*Reikim looks down
*Reikim still sees no stream
<adasdad> he says he's gonna humiliate me
<adasdad> he says it better work
<Tovler> My bed should be stickier after seeing Chel.
<Dr_Fumbles> Reikim: Did you look under the tray?
*Reikim looks under the tray
<Reikim> Waaaait
<Reikim> There is no tray
*Lunar_Brony looks inside his pop can
<Dr_Fumbles> there's your problem
<Lunar_Brony> empty
<Dr_Fumbles> lol
*Lunar_Brony cracks open a Coke
<Reikim> I suppose next I'm supposed to look behind me, but I suppose that's dangerous now
<Lunar_Brony> much better
<Dr_Fumbles> yes
<Dr_Fumbles> I put bait out, maybe it'll lure the stream from hiding
<Reikim> Can you check behind me? I'm scared now.
<Biglaw> Ahem, Slenderman

<pony5432> Lunar_Brony: I kept having to resist the urge to throw money at my screen.
<pony5432> Hm
<Dr_Fumbles> No slenderman here, though I think an enderman took the stream...
<pony5432> Why
<Lunar_Brony> pony5432 I threw a can of Coke at it when reaching for my wallet. Thank Celestia it was empty
<pony5432> Lunar_Brony: By the way I'm Reikim but my nick is for some reason unavailable to me.

<Lightning-Quill> Same here
<hen3ry> Sup, Cana?
<Canadian_Brony> . . . oh lord, am I killing the chat again?
<Canadian_Brony> here we go . . .
<hen3ry> No, you're not killing it.
<Shamroc> ...wut? dead?
<hen3ry> It's dying of natural causes.
<Lightning-Quill> Nah it was already dying
<Shamroc> makes snese
<Hat> http://derpy.me/pVOUO
<Zombie_Brony> much better
<hen3ry> Killing it would be saying something ridiculous until no one wants to talk anymore.
<Polydunami> Well, today was a busy day.
<JRP2234[iPhone]> Lottery yet?
<hen3ry> already passed, JRP
<Polydunami> JRP2234[iPhone], http://www.bronystate.net/2012/07/06/lottery-results-7612/
<Lightning-Quill> What is the lottery thing?
<hen3ry> People submit votes for what movies and pony episodes to show on movie night, then lottery picks winners, unless the vote was really lame
<CrimsonPhoenix> meh movies Great ponies
<JRP2234[iPhone]> Gfggtgfddyygddrts
<CrimsonPhoenix> meh mostly because I haven't heard of those
<CrimsonPhoenix> they might be glorious though
<Polydunami> OR, hen3ry, if they can't find whatever movie that's scheduled
<Tassadork> how about a nice game of thermonuclear war?
<hen3ry> Polydunami: that's more a "sorry, uh, can't accomodate" than a veto tho
<JRP2234[iPhone]> Why DO I ALWAS FUCKING NOT THIS LOTTORY aaaaahh
<hen3ry> Yeah, Wargames was a good movie back in the day.
<Lightning-Quill> Sorry f I'm in and out. I'm trying to find scary games to play
<hen3ry> what's the other one?
<Tassadork> never seen it but I know the meme. looking forward to that
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lightning-Quill, YOU AND ME IN PM
<Polydunami> B movie is called Young Frankenstein :S
<hen3ry> mel brooks
<Polydunami> Mel Brooks again!?
<hen3ry> Never seen it but given the man's track record, I'll give it a shot
<Hat> What are the chances of my movie getting played
<Mutterguy> Was
<JRP2234[iPhone]> Spc containment breach
<hen3ry> about 1 in 160 or so.
<hen3ry> at least that was the rough number of entries today
<Mutterguy> wasn't Young Frankenstein from tasmania?
<Hat> But my movie is the best!!!!2
<hen3ry> doesnt matter. lottery picks it
<Polydunami> Hat, it's random. Allegedly.
<hen3ry> they showed Final Fantasy movie.
<Hat> Has anyone seen Miracle Dogs Too?
<hen3ry> I believe in random crap happen
<Tassadork> sometimes they post a link to the random number site they use with the result. sometimes not =P
<Polydunami> Nope, Hat, and I don't plan on seeing it.
<Hat> Don't it's terrible
<JRP2234[iPhone]> Goo blues
<Eddmario> Woah, the chat server was just f'd up for a second there
<Ponies47> I chose a B movie that is so B movie! :d
<Hat> If the lottery picks a movie that isn't out yet, does Bronystate still show it on the stream?
<Polydunami> Okay, if it's a live action movie and the main characters are dogs, my first instinct is to stay far far away from it.
<Polydunami> Or cats or other animals
<hen3ry> how would they, hat?
<Hat> That's correct Polydunami, but the dogs are only in two scenes
<Tassadork> Polydunami: similarly if the main characters are CGI animals. most animals, in fact
<Hat> hen3ry, because Bronystate is cool
<Polydunami> Well, 101 Dalmatians wasn't so bad.
<Polydunami> Mainly because Disney
<Hat> The new MLP is pretty good as well
<Polydunami> Hm?
<hen3ry> cool, but not able to bend the laws of time and cinematic distribution
<Hat> They haven't tried yet
<Polydunami> Well, yeah. But I meant live action, Hat.
<Hat> :(
*Ponies47 Hates CGI
<Ponies47> I killed the chat :(
<Polydunami> Eh, there ARE good movies done mainly in computer graphics
<Zombie_Brony> Ponies47 IMPOSSIBRU! That's my job!
<Hat> Mostly ending in a dance scene
<Ponies47> Polydunami: Yes there all. But some CGI -_-
<Hat> Zombie_Brony, you bring things back from dead
<Ponies47> *are
<Zombie_Brony> Hat I am dead
<Hat> Bad luck
<Polydunami> So people really like the Madagascar movies. I'm skeptical.
<Hat> Ice Age?
<pooorfluttershy97> shrek

<sub06905> lol :D ^
<SparklyWaffles> Lunar_Brony Haha!
<Lunar_Brony> I told her that I couldn't date a fictional character, but I heard a voice in the back of my head
<sub06905> o.o
<Lunar_Brony> "But if you could, she would be my marefriend."
<PsychoticDoc> lol i love/hate my back-of-the-head voices
<Ponies47> I sing pony songs sometimes. One of these days I'm gonna go out into public and sing a pony song and record and post it onto the Ponies47 Youtube page MUHAHAHAHA! :P
<Lunar_Brony> this one I'm going to wear on the first day of school: http://www.redbubble.com/people/kuzcorish/works/7741397-stupid-people
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> whats Phase doing?
<Mister_Foster> damnit, the first thing that comes to my mind is: "What are you talking about... Cupcakes didn't scare me..."
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 I did that once. Not record it, though, but I walked through town singing "This Day Aria". I got 7 brohoofs
<PsychoticDoc> phase is cookin food
<sub06905> i think imma wear my Flootershai shirt for first day of school
<Ponies47> Lunar_Brony: Nice! But i start high school this year sso I have to make new friends. I'm gonna wait until I'm friends with some poeple and then tell em I like ponies :$
<Ponies47> Lunar_Brony: O_O NICE!
<SparklyWaffles> Lunar_Brony instant win
<sub06905> i wonder how many comments i will get on my fluttershy shirt when i go back to high school
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 I remember my first year of High School. We went from the seniors of the school to sprites.
<PsychoticDoc> My highschool has uniforms...
<Lunar_Brony> PsychoticDoc *cringe* ouch. The last uniform I ever wore was for Elementary Choir
<sub06905> oh uniforms? havent wore one of those in awhile
<Ponies47> Lunar_Brony: I have to go in one day before all the other grades do. I hate freshmen only day! :'(
<PsychoticDoc> Lunar_Brony: i went from uniforms to none to belts and tuckins to uniforms....
<SparklyWaffles> PsychoticDoc: I hate uniforms, ew...
<SparklyWaffles> >.<
<PsychoticDoc> SparklyWaffles: they stick to your back in warm weather lol
<sub06905> Ponies47: ur high school has a freshman only day?
<Lunar_Brony> PsychoticDoc up here, we go K-7, then 8-12. No middle school, and no uniforms
<Ponies47> sub06905: Yes. :(
<sub06905> Ponies47: wow :D
<SparklyWaffles> PsychoticDoc: It's true.. xD
<PsychoticDoc> Lunar_Brony: k, 2-3 4-6 7-8 9-12 for me
<sub06905> imma going to be a Junior this year :$
<Ponies47> sub06905: It sucks. All the freshman have to go in 1 day before all the other grades. School doesn't start till the end of August
<Lunar_Brony> PsychoticDoc 5 schools . . .
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 we dont' have that here
<Ponies47> Lunar_Brony: Lucky -_-
<PsychoticDoc> Lunar_Brony: Indeed, it can get very agitating registrating for them all
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 not totally. First day of Grade 8 was terrifying.
<Ponies47> My brother is a jerk. He says I'm gonna be a high school drop out. He jut thinks he's better then me. Show off -_-
<sub06905> i know seniors get out of school earlier here at my high school
<Ponies47> Lunar_Brony: 8th grade was meh for me
<Lunar_Brony> Walk right in and avoid ALL crowded areas
<SparklyWaffles> *shutters* ooh, I hated 8th grade.
<Lunar_Brony> I don't remember using the bathroom much, either
<sub06905> i enjoyed 7th and 8th grade :$
<Ponies47> Thank goodness I'm done with middle school.
<Lunar_Brony> Grade 9, I'm walkin' around feeling like I own the place
<Ponies47> sub06905: I hated 7th grade so much -_-
<PsychoticDoc> Lunar_Brony: during 5-6th grade, we had outdoor bathrooms that has moss and green stuff allover the place
<sub06905> Ponies47: why?
<Lunar_Brony> PsychoticDoc eeesh
<SparklyWaffles> PsychoticDoc: Oh Dear God
<PsychoticDoc> Lunar_Brony: needless to say, i mastered the art of holding it for around 9 hours straight
<Ponies47> sub06905: It was hell. Plus I had one (squee) of a(squee)ing of a (squee) English (squee)ing teacher -_-
<sub06905> man college is coming really close just need to complete 11th and 12th grade :O
<Lunar_Brony> PsychoticDoc the only reason I didn't use the bathroom in Grade 8 was you walk in there and you see a Grade 12 and you think "This guy's gonna pound me into the floor."
<sub06905> Ponies47: wow that sucks :\
<Ponies47> eeyup
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 dem squees
<PsychoticDoc> Lunar_Brony: that and the fact that it gets very uncomfortable if your not very tall like the older people in there
<Ponies47> I better hit they hay. GOOD NIGHT EVERYPONY! :)

<Saturn> 08,01so last night in an RP, i made it my mission to always refer to the other RPer's male parts as something different each time
<Saturn> 08,01getting more and more ridiculous as i went on
<DB_Brony> what were some of the more riduculous ones you used?
<Saturn> 08,01"pegacock" was one
<Saturn> 08,01"flutterpenis" too

<Saturn> 08,01"pleasureyoke"
<DB_Brony> this was a MLP RP, right?
<Saturn> 08,01it was
<DB_Brony> okay, it would have been a lot weirder if it weren't
<Saturn> 08,01there were several times last night where i was laughing too hard irl to continue for several minutes
<Saturn> 08,01never laugh at your own jokes
<Saturn> 08,01unless youre genuinely funny, like me

<Liokin> Shamroc: Wow...its like gaming tried to abort a baby but failed so it made this god awful mixup death chamber of randmones....
<Shamroc> wut?
<Liokin> Saturn: Thats a sign of the apocolypse.
<Shamroc> Phase4: sposed to shoot it
<Liokin> Run from what???
<Saturn> 08,01an example: "its a model of the big bang, but with my cum"
<Liokin> Saturn: That would be kinda epix
<Saturn> 08,01i lost it when i read that
<Liokin> Saturn: I mean horriblky awkward.
<Liokin> Saturn: But epic.
<Cp_MasterBoss43> Jolly good derp PsychoticDog.
<Saturn> 08,01because this was during an honest to god sexytimes rp
<diddutz> However, i have no idea how that should be a helpful model
<brony_swan> ive been accepted to the source filmaker it finnished installing so..gunna check it out, cya later
<Liokin> Saturn: That actually just doesnt even make sense...
<Liokin> Saturn: Unless pervyness has evolved past what I know.
<Saturn> 08,01Liokin: it was a cumgularity
<Liokin> Saturn: See that word means "Error not found" to my brain..
<Saturn> 08,01its mass was all contained within its schwarzchild radius
<Atler_Tempest> <_< >_>
<Liokin> Saturn: uhh..
<Saturn> 08,01it was *sunglasses* a white hole.
<Saturn> 08,01YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAH
<Atler_Tempest> =.=
<Liokin> ohhh I get it....like black hole...but with...ahh yeah...
<diddutz> Saturn: pls give us more of that :D
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i think im pushing slightly past the boundaries of PG-14 here
<Saturn> 08,01so lets talk about something else
<Liokin> wow saturn wow....
<Liokin> that is just sad...pg buckin 14...ehhh..
<Atler_Tempest> ok... i just finished ME3 with the new ending DLC... it fixed so many issues i had with the old ending...
<Saturn> 08,01Liokin: channel rules, im afraid
<Liokin> Saturn: Let me level with you then.
<Liokin> Saturn: why is it the mane channel the one that everyone is defaultly sent to
<Liokin> Saturn: Why does it...how do I say it....Suck
<Liokin> Saturn: I meam cmon how many of us here are like buckin 12?
<Atler_Tempest> cause all the other channels are closed down unless its movie night
<Liokin> Saturn: It kills me a little -lol
<Saturn> 08,01Liokin: i like it that its PG in here, actually
<Liokin> Saturn: Elaborate your reasoning behind that for me.
<Saturn> 08,01there are plenty of people in here who are uncomfortable with talking about mature things
<Saturn> 08,01some of the mods, certainly
<Saturn> 08,01for example, valthejean
<Saturn> 08,01some like to keep ponies innocent
<Saturn> 08,01most, actually
<Atler_Tempest> <_< >_> im not one of those people...
<Saturn> 08,01anyway, there are other channels for talking about sexytimes
<Shamroc> all the sexytimes
<Saturn> 08,01like #stupidsexytwilight, which i made when for when i wanted to talk about sex and sexuality without polluting this channel
<Saturn> 08,01not an official bronystate channel, btw
<Liokin> chat derp
<Liokin> but yeah saturn like I was saying
<Liokin> its just that it seens some rules censor the fun of things
<Liokin> Im not saying you need sex orientated things to have fun
<Kammerjunk> so i herd u gais liek d'aaww http://i.imgur.com/r1Ptk.png
<Saturn> 08,01Liokin: did you see my above posts?
<Liokin> no sir i didnt
<Liokin> Chat derped
<Saturn> 08,01some like to keep ponies innocent
<Saturn> 08,01most, actually
<Saturn> 08,01for example, valthejean
<Saturn> 08,01anyway, there are other channels for talking about sexytimes
<Liokin> I get that. But I didnt say ponies were what needed to be uncensored
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: your lack of replu
<Saturn> 08,01like #stupidsexytwilight, which i made when for when i wanted to talk about sex and sexuality without polluting this channel
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> reply*

<Phase4> 00,02my lack of what now?
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, if *i* can enjoy a pg channel just as much as a non pg channel, so can you buggers :P
<Phase4> 00,02oooo
<Phase4> 00,02dedicated server is allmost downloaded
<Phase4> 00,02^ Saturn
<Atler_Tempest> look... if this chat wasnt kept at a PG-13 level, there would be chaos... it would literally be just like 4chan forums, pretty much worthless
<Saturn> 08,01what are you playing Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, gmod
<Saturn> 08,01ah
<Saturn> 08,01Atler_Tempest: exactly. itd be like #brony, which is a horrible place
<Atler_Tempest> Saturn: indeed
<Saturn> 08,01its much more light hearted and fun in here
<Atler_Tempest> Saturn: that place is like the /b/ of ponychat...
<Saturn> 08,01indeed
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, its a matter of freedoms
<Shamroc> moop
<Atler_Tempest> and no one talks about /b/... <_< >_>
<Liokin-> efffiiinnn chat derp!
<Saturn> 08,01freedom to and freedom from
<Shamroc> what is this /b/ ;p
<Liokin-> ook im back
<Shamroc> ohai
<Liokin-> now what I was saying saturn I agree with you
<Saturn> 08,01this chat is the way it is, a friendly, welcoming atmksphere, partly because we have freedom from mature stuff
<Shamroc> yep..
<Liokin-> I suppose but what about others who feed off of the more adult culture
<Liokin-> Gore
<Liokin-> Comedics beyond standard
<Atler_Tempest> there is still mature stuff, but its kept within tasteful limits
<ACS13123> Dat chimera
<Liokin-> nudity
<Saturn> 08,01we lose the freedom to, say, come in and start complaining about our sex lives in great detail
<Shamroc> night everypony its 4am for me..and sleep is needed
<Atler_Tempest> Liokin: things like Gore and Nudity wont be shown here unless its in a movie that the mods have cleared...
<Saturn> 08,01but we gain freedom from some associated natiness that comes in large unregulated chats
<Shamroc> have fun talkin bout your channles Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01see you Shamroc
<Saturn> 08,01we want bronystate to be fun and accessible to the most possible people
<DB_Brony> I'd say we're free but also smart enough to know that no-one cares about simple little negative things.
<Saturn> 08,01so this means keeping it pg
<ACS13123> fly
<flutterisbest> :)
<Saturn> 08,01as i said before, a lot of bronies like to keep any pony related things innocent
<Saturn> 08,01we wouldnt want to scare people off
<DB_Brony> yeah, if someones not enjoying because of me, then i'm not enjoying.
<Saturn> 08,01this is a safe, happy place
<Liokin> ok back AGAIN
<Atler_Tempest> i dont mind any of the adult material, but i wont bring it to this channel...
<Irish_Pony> Hi all and what in the world is tthis?
<Saturn> 08,01could someone be a doll and pastebin my last 20 or so lines for Liokin ?
<Atler_Tempest> lol
<Saturn> 08,01i would but im on my phone
<DB_Brony> Irish_Pony: :Oi have no idea
<Lasharus> I just woke up, so I'm afraid I'll have to decline.
<Irish_Pony> :D
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Atler_Tempest> ive honestly never seen someones chat derp this much... liokin should probably use a different IRC instead of the one built into BronyState...
<Liokin-> ok befire anything else happens
<DB_Brony> so... what is this? a earthbound counterstrike?
<Liokin-> Saturn: I agree and disagree
<Liokin-> Saturn: I feel adult oriented things should have there own chat then bla bla bla
<Atler_Tempest> adult oriented chats do have their own channels...
<Liokin-> Saturn: And I agree your right this chat is fine as is being a welcoming staple of Brs bla bla ba
<Atler_Tempest> you can also make your own channel if you so wish
<Liokin-> Atler_Tempest: Yeah when someone makes a temporary one
<MegaMoonShine> Hi everybo- O___0
<MegaMoonShine> What is this? :S
<Atler_Tempest> Liokin-: yeah, or if you wanna discuss something adult based with other people you can PM them... the bronystate mane chat is family friendly
<Atler_Tempest> talking about nudity or sex, normally isnt that
<DB_Brony> MegaMoonShine: chimera hunt or some game like that, frankly i'm still trying to figure out
<MegaMoonShine> DB_Brony: Yeah, I saw. The title came up on stream
<Kandarihu> Good morning, Twi_Fi
<Atler_Tempest> and that guys chat probably derped again... ffs... i hate talking to people this way >_<
<DB_Brony> I'd say that if it's adult oriented, probably not everyone on the mane chat wants to hear about it.
<cow334> hello every one
<MegaMoonShine> hello cow334 :)
<DB_Brony> hey, cow334
<cow334> hello MegaMoonShine and DB_Brony
<Kandarihu> This looks like an interesting Mother 3 fangame.
<MegaMoonShine> Ahh, I thought those looked familiar :$
*Atler_Tempest sighs. 'Guess I'll turn on the stream and see what is being talked about'
<Kandarihu> So the Ultimate Chimera is playable?
<Atler_Tempest> ok... all i see is programming...
<Atler_Tempest> and now... pigs?
<Kandarihu> It might be hard to understand if you've never played Mother 3.
<XAX> And back.
<Atler_Tempest> >_< ive played Mother 3... this is just weird...
<MegaMoonShine> I've never played it :D
<Atler_Tempest> hmm... this is kinda... meh
<cow334> ,=,e
<cow334> turttle
<CrazyCherry|Work> Homies unite!
<Atler_Tempest> what the hell is the point of this... to jump on its back?
<cow334> CrazyCherry|Work:
<cow334> ....
<CrazyCherry|Work> cow334:
<cow334> CrazyCherry|Work: ._.
<CrazyCherry|Work> cow334: What?
<cow334> CrazyCherry|Work: ._.
<CrazyCherry|Work> cow334: Quiet you!
<XAX> ._.
<Atler_Tempest> =_=
<cow334> CrazyCherry|Work: im sorry
<Kandarihu> The Pigmask army ruined the peaceful life of Tazmily Village, carrying out their leader's misguided attempts to revolutionize an already idyllic society with such things as chimeras.
<Atler_Tempest> this is just weird... when do they get their shotguns?
<cow334> CrazyCherry|Work: ,=,e
<MegaMoonShine> Atler_Tempest: When episode 3 comes out
<ACS13123> Atler_Tempest: they get it when Episode 3 comes out
<CrazyCherry|Work> cow334: :3
<Atler_Tempest> curses
<MegaMoonShine> That was my least favourite Star Wars
<XAX> Episode 3 was my least favorite star wars
<cow334> CrazyCherry|Work: where are you at right now like are you on a computer from work or something?
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<XAX> Dammit MegaMoonShine
<MegaMoonShine> ^Ninja'd
<ACS13123> XAX: waht the... oh fuck you :p
<ACS13123> XAX: jk jk
*Saturn 08,01puts on some Black Sabbath
<Kandarihu> Many of the chimeras were animals turned into cyborgs for no purpose other than to be cooler. The Ultimate Chimera was so powerful that it cannot be fought. The only thing that one can do is toggle it's power with the button on it's back.
<cow334> ill be right back
<cow334_gone> and hello Saturn
<XAX> Kandarihu: Thank you for telling us all the Lore of ultimate chimera hunt
<XAX> ._.
<Atler_Tempest> i just wanted to know if they had to jump on it...
<CrazyCherry|Work> cow334: I should be working, except I'm not. I'm at home, and I need to go away soon.
<Atler_Tempest> i only liked Earthbound... Mother 3 was kinda, meh to me...
*ACS13123 *clap clap clap*

<MegaMoonShine> Hello oni_link :)
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma do a bit of programing
<oni_link> Hi Saturn! I
<oni_link> hello MegaMoonShine
<Saturn> 08,01imma go retrieve my laptop from work
<oni_link> sweet
<Atler_Tempest> imma probably gonna go to bed... 5:40am...

<Atler_Tempest> oni_link: ive also been up since 8 yesterday...
<Saturn> 08,01imma do the book
<oni_link> MAlavolent: Im gonna do a book. awww :9
<shana> Phase4: btw is that the actual sourcecode or is it a decompilation?
<oni_link> :)
<oni_link> lol
<Phase4> 00,02shana, decompilation
<MAlavolent> This is why I love this chat :3
<Phase4> 00,02shana, not sure how to contact the orignal author
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: carrier pigeon
<Phase4> 00,02havent found anything from him/her newer than 2003 and they're japanese
<oni_link> Atler_Tempest: ohhh you should rest then
<Atler_Tempest> Phase4: telepathy
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, that could work
<shana> Phase4: yeah me neither
<Saturn> 08,01i want some food
<Atler_Tempest> then go feed
<Saturn> 08,01ive had a very tiring morning
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i'm not sure of the legality of it but theres a few things i could definantly release
<Saturn> 08,01for reasons i shant go into
<Phase4> 00,02eg: utf-8 encoded resources
<Phase4> 00,02instead of the broken shift-jis they're in now
<Phase4> 00,02not entirely sure how java handles missing classes
<Phase4> 00,02i imagine its an exception thrown when you try to instance it
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma assume that cause it makes this simpler
<shana> missing classes is rather rare oO
<Saturn> 08,01thats more or less correct
<Saturn> 08,01afair
<shana> unless you do dynamic loading of classes and stuff..
<Liokin> Saturn: Do you know of any brony forums?
<Saturn> 08,01Liokin: ukofequestris.co.uk
<shana> Phase4: what class is missing?
<Saturn> 08,01Liokin: ukofequestria.co.uk
<oni_link> Whoa my dropbox was upgraded to 52.8 GB for setting it up on my SIII :O
<Saturn> 08,01nice
<Phase4> 00,02shana, two places this ocours, one is JTablet (extention that most likley does not exist on any random system) and java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment which is standard sense java 1.5
<oni_link> feelsgoodman.jpg :)
<Phase4> 00,02this targeted java 1.1
<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, Dat quota
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<oni_link> yes quite Phase4 :P
<shana> Phase4: did you add jtablet to the classpath?
<Liokin> Saturn: UK is all you've got huh?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i'm not getting the exception, just wondering how it handles it
<shana> ah ok
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> phase4

<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> i would like to welcome to the memorial for carlton
<oni_link> Phase4: If you had told me like 2 months ago, I would have used that link
<shana> Phase4: is registration enough or do I have to use it?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, registration should be enough

<oni_link> so that server is a no go eh?
<LightTrooper105> lulz
<EggWhite> If I can do math.
<shana> Phase4: I have written a python program that takes the raw network data from the paintchat server and produces a .svg file of the image... it's very rough but it produces something recognizable
<Phase4> 00,02oh neat
<Phase4> 00,02i'd love to see that
<Phase4> 00,02havent got around to figuring out its network stuff
<DJZephyr> ^^
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm

<shana> Phase4: is it a out of stack space exception :D
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02shana, that would have been funny

<shana> Phase4: this is an example output, converted to png and downscaled: http://s8.postimage.org/74wgtqccz/foo.png
<Phase4> 00,02MAlavolent, paintchat
<shana> Phase4: it doesn't supported the brushes and such.. only renders path and color
<Phase4> 00,02shana, not bad
<MAlavolent> Oh, that's fine too. Though console breaker is pretty badass.
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i would help you with the brush code but i think i've found the brush code
<Phase4> 00,02i call it M.java
<Phase4> 00,02aka: HELL
<shana> Phase4: http://pastebin.com/dswk9YaD it's actually pretty small code :D
<Phase4> 00,023.6k lines of obfuscated java
<shana> Phase4: yeah some of my code is from the decompiled java
<Phase4> 00,02shana, do you have a bitbucket account?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wow dat drawing

<FairysHuff> Hallo. I return. ~_~
<oni_link> Hi FairysHuff
<Phase4> 00,02that was a strange bug
<shana> Phase4: http://pastebin.com/eCdGKpnD this is the script for mips, outputs the stream to stdout.. works rather well
<FairysHuff> Chat dead huh?
<Phase4> 00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, try join mine now
<FairysHuff> oni_link Hallo
<Phase4> 00,02ah

<oni_link> How ya doin today?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, see rtmpdump isnt in the arch repo's
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> it worked NOW TELL ME HOW U DID THAT
<Phase4> 00,02so i used wireshark to find the rtmp url
<Phase4> 00,02they have no protection on their streams
*Vordox is pulling alot of strings around the world for Brony sharing.
<shana> Phase4: yeah finding the rtmp parameters is always a pain...
<oni_link> FairysHuff: you seem tired
<shana> Phase4: the ones from mips remain pretty constant, livestream.com is much more difficult..
<FairysHuff> oni_link I am. Didn't sleep well at all.
<Phase4> 00,02livestream's flash player is a bit better though
<Phase4> 00,02good enough that i just use it and dont care
<oni_link> FairysHuff: aw that sucks
<shana> yeah that's true..
<FairysHuff> oni_link yup
<oni_link> oh well at least you can relax for a bit right?

<Toranaga> It's always someone who died, someone who had an affair, someone charged with molesting kids, drug problems, anything
*oni_link is working on dem chiptunes
<Vordox> Phase4: I'd prefer ANY song with good beat
<Vordox> And not some crazy hip hop crap that sucks
<Vordox> Quality wise, effort wise, and feeling wise.
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Phase4> 00,02soo much utter crap out there right now
<Orange_Peel> If there are 10K+ people in any group, some of them are doing something. Just a function of how many celebrities there are
<Vordox> Also Phase4, what'cha up to, what c++ you do?
<oni_link> todays music doesn't have that feel
<derp> -6
<Phase4> 00,02this is java, c++ would probably be easier
<Vordox> oni_link: Some has.
<Vordox> Phase4: Oh the Paint chat thing?
<Phase4> 00,02then again a c++ decompile...
<Saturn> 08,01any SST regulars in here?
<oni_link> Vordox: well as a whole it doesn't
<Phase4> 00,02sst?
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, yeah
<Chrysalis> SST?
<Saturn> 08,01stupidsexy
<Chrysalis> oh yeah...
<derp> one day bronies will rule the world...........
<Toranaga> Most of the pony tunes are Dubstep I noticed
<oni_link> derp: my kinda world
<derp> indeed
<cow334_GENTELMEN> ,=,O-O
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, any SST regs who are coming to buck, pm me
<Toranaga> The fandom runs on consistancy of the show
<oni_link> Toranaga: I noticed
<Toranaga> If it's the time between two seasons. Thats always the darkest
<derp> yes
<Phase4> 00,02oh wow
<Phase4> 00,02putting your mouse over those things on the left
<Toranaga> When the show returns. Thats when people come back and the time when most convert
<derp> nyan remix
<Phase4> 00,02ip addr and port things
<Phase4> 00,02CREATES a thread
<O-O> ,=,O-O
<Toranaga> So if the show got cancelled then the fandom would die in a matter of weeks.
<alexxm> Toranaga i became a brony during the break during the first and second season
<oni_link> Toranaga: pretty much when its topical
<derp> became a brony 3 weeks ago
<Saturn> 08,01Toranaga: when
<Saturn> 08,01not if
<Toranaga> Exactly guys. The internet is the fandoms life support system
<oni_link> I became a fan in time to watch the season finale. and it was here on the stream :) <3
<Toranaga> Yes, sadly it's certain the show will die at some point. We just have to hope not soon.
<Chrysalis> i doubt itll die soon
<derp> dont say tha
<Chrysalis> theres so much money flow
<Chrysalis> and hasbro are just realising how to tap into it
<Saturn> 08,01i think this will be the last season
<oni_link> Chrysalis: exactly
<Toranaga> The show and the fandom is in a coma, the only thing keeping it alive is the internet.
<alexxm> i joined bronystate around read it and weep oni_link
<derp> noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<oni_link> Saturn: i think this will be milked dry
<Toranaga> If it's the last season then this wonderful and unique fandom would die.
<Chrysalis> Toranaga yes... thats why there are so many new fan arts and new fanfics uploaded daily
<oni_link> alexxm: niiiice :P

<oni_link> dont know if cutie mark should be drum sticks or an NES controller
<Toranaga> Some of the members of the fandom have poured their life in this show. So when it gets cancelled, they will be heartbroken.
<derp> wut
<FillyFlam> oni_link: Drumsticks.
<Toranaga> I heard of stories about guys getting kicked out of their houses because they watch the show.
<Phase4> 00,02shana, you here?
<derp> its true
<shana> Phase4: eyup
<Chrysalis> ohai scooter
<Chrysalis> bye scooter
<oni_link> FillyFlam: thanks, now I need a name :D
<oni_link> what was that just now Phase4 ?
<Phase4> 00,02you wouldnt happen to know why java interprets file:// url's as ftp would you?
<Chrysalis> oh my godess'
<derp> CRUSH KILL DESTROY SWAG
<FillyFlam> oni_link: Now that I can't help you with, lol.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> interesting song
<Toranaga> No we wouldn't. I'm not much of a computer wiz
<shana> Phase4: which class do you use to handle the url?
<oni_link> FillyFlam: well thanks either way lol
<Phase4> 00,02this song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk7xH-a3O9k
<Phase4> 00,02shana, java.net.URL
<oni_link> anypony wanna help my name my oc?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> silly Phase you cant post video links during stream
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> :3
<Chrysalis> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG mods do what they want
<Chrysalis> .gif
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> :33
<shana> Phase4: you mean when you parse the url with java.net.URL the protocal part will be file?
<derp> spaaaaaaaaaaaaace
<shana> Phase4: err I mean ftp
<Phase4> 00,02shana, do you have a java ide installed?
<shana> Phase4: yup eclipse
<Toranaga> Bye guy's Imma go play Shogun 2 now.
<Phase4> 00,02shana, in the one thats on bitbucket now, put it in eclipse and run...
<alexxm> bye Toranaga
<derp> its sooo quit
<oni_link> Bye Toranaga
<Phase4> 00,02shana, paintchat_frame.PFrame in debug
<derp> quite
<oni_link> quiet derp?
<derp> 3xquite
<Phase4> 00,02shana, break on UnknownHostException
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> KERBALS
<derp> tooo quite madness slowly sets upon me
<alexxm> is there supposed to be no sounds
<Vordox> What...the fuck is that...Pha?
<Vordox> I've never seen somethign so...hideous..
<derp> who could play this!?!?!
<derp> im dyeing...... dyeing of borrdom
<ACS13123> Kerbal ;D
<Phase4> 00,02i find that very impresive
<derp> typeing on my kindle fire by the way
<shana> Phase4: it starts fine, which buttons should I press to replicate the bug?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, it starts fine?
<Phase4> 00,02oh
<Phase4> 00,02shana, action->client
<XAX> Lol if you wait long enough on the loading screen of Ratchet and clank 2, Ratchet starts playing Jak 3
<XAX> >_>
<Phase4> 00,02i'm tired and assumed you knew what to do somehow
<derp> yes oice!!!!!!
<Phase4> 00,02shana, it does URL(codebase url, './res/') and cant open the result
<derp> oice hate useing this thng totype
<derp> gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa noice noice noice ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
<derp> ok i know how to spell noise now
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back
<shana> Phase4: works fine for me
<Phase4> 00,02strange
<Chrysalis> welcome to coding
<oni_link> Its early, I gotta nap. Ill see you all later. Hopefully today :D and thanks Phase4 for streaming /)
*Phase4 00,02hugs oni_link
<Chrysalis> night oni_link
<shana> Phase4: can you point out file+line where the exception occurs?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, line 193 of Data.java is where it breaks
<Phase4> 00,02shana, great minds think alike /)
<shana> :)
<derp> soo long have long nights and pleasent travels
<alexxm> hey Dark92Enigma hows your day been
<derp> oni link
<shana> Phase4: hm thats in the runLobby function, is that correct?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, its in init(), might be more than one Data.java
<Phase4> 00,02the one in paintchat_client
<shana> ah ok
<SpringStingray> Hey guys, who are we watching today?
<shana> Phase4: have you changed the configuration
<Chrysalis> SpringStingray currently streaming is Phase4
<derp> stuff
<Phase4> 00,02shana, not sure what config you're refering to
<derp> :D
<shana> Phase4: cnf/paintchat.cf
<Phase4> 00,02dont belive so
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm I'm fine.,.....waiting for EL DORADO!
<Phase4> 00,02i'll be anoyed if i have, i think thats in the bitbucket and is suposed to be the same as pchat366.zip
<Phase4> 00,02aparently i have
<Phase4> 00,02its looking in www/.paintchat
<derp> the many faces of pony;) i dont know how to do derpyns:) :( :D
<Phase4> 00,02shana, the file exists
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i'm getting an unknown host exception
<shana> Phase4: I have the same, the url it constructs for me is file:/bla/folder//Paintchat/www/.paintchat
<shana> Phase4: what kind of url do you get?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, c:/path
<Phase4> 00,02i think it worked on linux
<shana> Phase4: ah could be a windows specific bug :(
<shana> Phase4: c:/ is intepreted as the protocol or something like that..
<Phase4> 00,02seems like
<Phase4> 00,02but then again, its appending to the codebase
<shana> Phase4: I suggest not using net.url for constructing filenames
<Phase4> 00,02have to, this is the applet code
<shana> oh..
<Phase4> 00,02plus decompile, so not sure whats safe to change
<shana> Phase4: shoudn't getCodeBase return file://c:/path ?
<shana> Phase4: the doc says it returns a url
<Phase4> 00,02thats the thing
<Phase4> 00,02it should
<Phase4> 00,02hence the confusion
<Phase4> 00,02infact it does
<Phase4> 00,02and constructs a correct url for a different path
<shana> Phase4: did it just say that C: is the authority part of the url oO?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, it did
<Phase4> 00,02i'm going to check its not doing something stupid like using URL(String, String)
<shana> Phase4: I think it does the correct thing... it parse the url and treats C: special..
<shana> Phase4: so there is no easy fix for windows..
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<Chrysalis> shana all relative addressing?
<Chrysalis> howdy Everlasting_Joy
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fav.me/d56fhqw
<shana> Chrysalis: it's java that returns the absolute address
<Phase4> 00,02its strange because it does exactly the same thing earlier in the code and it works perfect
<shana> Phase4: is it Awt.openStream in both cases?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, yeah
<Phase4> 00,02i think
<Phase4> 00,02one sce
<Phase4> 00,02yes
<Phase4> 00,02if you click buttons too soon on the pframe, it lock sup
<sonicandmario85> HELLO
<sonicandmario85> GOOD MORNING EVERYPONY
<Phase4> 00,02sonicandmario85, HELLO GOOD SIR, IT IS NICE TO MEET YOU
<alexxm> hey sonicandmario85 you sleep well
<Flammie> Afternoon here in the British Isles, but hello regardless! ^^
<Phase4> 00,02theres a channel for allcaps, its not this one :P
<sonicandmario85> alexxm:yep :3
<strawberrie_smuckerz> BUT THIS IS THE TRADITIONAL ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE!!!
<Everlasting_Joy> Morning sonicandmario85.
<sonicandmario85> also since i live in america its morning :3
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02i cant single step into URI
<Everlasting_Joy> Phase4: Wait, there's a channel where you can talk in allcaps?
<Phase4> 00,02URL'
<Phase4> 00,02Everlasting_Joy, yep
<sonicandmario85> i just use caps to shout XD
<Flammie> You can use %Bbold%B, instead.
<sonicandmario85> PewDiePie:GOD DAMIT BOY YOU DISAPOINT ME SO MUCH!! Son:IM SORRY DAD ): PewDiePie:I DONT CAREEEEEE!! SHUT UP YOU FUCKING DISGRACE
<sonicandmario85> xD
<Flammie> Shoot, that doesn't work on lightIRC. Works on Chatzilla.
<Chrysalis> wth
<Phase4> 00,02shana, it has file as the url
<sonicandmario85> what are you doing dere phase? :3
<shana> Phase4: it actually looks ok, with the exception that C: is authority and not part of the file..
*Bronysith glomps Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02and if i put the url in firefox it works
*Phase4 00,02hugs Bronysith back
<Phase4> 00,02sonicandmario85, debugging stupi
<Phase4> 00,02stupid'
<|Discord|> MY WUBS...PASS THEM AROUND
<Phase4> 00,02shana, as far as i can see the url is correct
<sonicandmario85> ok i didnt know :P
<Phase4> 00,02sonicandmario85, i meen the thing i'm debugging is stupid
<shana> Phase4: yeah but what if some code only uses the file part of the url, then windows won't find the file
<Phase4> 00,02stupid ambiguious english
<sonicandmario85> oh
<Phase4> 00,02shana, then why can it open res.zip? twice?
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Bronysith.
<Bronysith> oy Everlasting_Joy
<shana> Phase4: hm.. can you breakpoint there and look if the url looks the same?
<Bronysith> how are you Everlasting_Joy
<Phase4> 00,02i cant step into awt.openstream
<Phase4> 00,02no sources for some reason
<Phase4> 00,02i have them on linux
<shana> Phase4: you'd need the java sourcecode for that
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Pretty bad man. I have to cancel my show today due to me not having my laptop.
<shana> Phase4: btw. what's the exception thrown, file not found?
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: ouch
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: You get use to it.
<Phase4> 00,02shana, unknown host exception
<Phase4> 00,02its trying to resolve 'c'
<shana> oh whoa
<sonicandmario85> also if you think windows 7 is better than windows xp its faster than 7 on mine but its slow on my computer because it has poor ram and its old it was designed for windows 98
<shana> that looks like it's ignoring that protocol is file oO
<Phase4> 00,02it is
<Phase4> 00,02its trying to interpret it as an ftp protocol
<Phase4> 00,02i Had the problem on linux and dug through the system libs
<Phase4> 00,02if it doesnt have a host it interprets it as ftp iirc
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<Phase4> 00,02if it Does have a host
<Phase4> 00,02the host on this url is "C"
<shana> Phase4: yeah but it should see that the protocol is file and not unknown
<Saturn> 08,01i smell wonderful
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Damn them letters
<Phase4> 00,02shana, http://pastebin.com/c8HKd6Ft
<Chrysalis> Saturn you trying out your stuff for BUCK?
*Saturn 08,01likes using womens deoderent
<sonicandmario85> Rainbow Dash:It Needs To Be About 20% Cooler.
<sonicandmario85> :3
<Saturn> 08,01it smells so much nicer tjan mens
<Phase4> 00,02shana, it completly ignores protocol, cant remember in what file this breaks
<Saturn> 08,01mens smells like public bathrooms most of the time
<sonicandmario85> Saturn:XD
<shana> Phase4: hmm yeah host set could be bad..
<Sumica> 00,10I think you are using round logic Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01hmm
<Saturn> 08,01maybe
<shana> Phase4: so why does it work sometimes?
<Saturn> 08,01but still, i dont like the smell
<Phase4> 00,02no .setHost method
<Phase4> 00,02shana, can you break there and see what url it makes?
<Saturn> 08,01mens deo smells sharper in general
<Saturn> 08,01i like soft smells
<Cypresswolf> -_- my ethernet is still down...stream keeps buffering
<shana> Phase4: can you give line number?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, paintchat_client/Data.java:193
<sonicandmario85> my dad has a deordirante stone you put water on it and then rub it in your arm pits and then use a towel on them and they werent sweaty anymore :D the smell didnt smell like a bathroom or anything xD
<Dark92Enigma> WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE SONG?
<Saturn> 08,01i hope wreks back on soon
<Dark92Enigma> It's 20% cooler
<sonicandmario85> 0TF2 XD
<Chrysalis> Dark92Enigma AlexS - 20% cooler
<Chrysalis> ohai demoman
<Phase4> 00,02strange
<Dark92Enigma> Chrysalis Thanks :)
<Phase4> 00,02host is set for the other things
<Cypresswolf> I had to rage quit during B movie - stream would pause for a few minutes then would play and skip ahead to catch up - that garbled audio ticked me off
<Phase4> 00,02the only thing i can think of is lack of a windows style extention
<Phase4> 00,02it starts with .
<Phase4> 00,02filename that is
<Cypresswolf> doing it right now too -_-
<Chrysalis> isnt a file/folder starting with a '.' illegal in windows?
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony
<shana> Chrysalis: nope
<Chrysalis> huh, thought it was
<Bronysith> hi Meanwhile mario
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: Meanwhile has a mario hat
<Chrysalis> i have a BUCK hat
<sonicandmario85> i have a headphone hat
<applejack096> Im back after 5 months!!!!!! BAAAAH! How did I survive!!!!!
<sonicandmario85> XD
<sonicandmario85> jk xD
<TheRandomkid321> I also have a ario hat.
<TheRandomkid321> *mario
<Chrysalis> everyone has hats?
<Cypresswolf> Im off to raid Toys R Us - opens in 15 minutes - hopefully I find something on the shelf this time - plan B is I drive to College station over an hour away
<Chrysalis> OMG ITS TF2 IRL
<Meanwhile> I only have it because dari was like "You should get a Mario hat"
<TheRandomkid321> Chysalis This AINT TF2
<Meanwhile> So I did.
<sonicandmario85> im just using headphones im not wearing any hats
<Chrysalis> theres a heavy hat which is just headphones
<TheRandomkid321> I'll try to find my hat
<applejack096> Hey whos playing the music
<sonicandmario85> they are wireless too :#
<TheRandomkid321> Itll cover up my sh!tty hair cut
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, its NOT illegal, but explorer.exe will yell at you for trying to make one
<Chrysalis> applejack096 Phase4 is currently streaming
<Cypresswolf> College Station is the next nearest Toys R Us store - :) I love living out in the sticks
<cow334> America
<applejack096> Kk
<Meanwhile> Steaming the chat.
<Chrysalis> Fair enough, tend to avoid file interop like that
<ScootaChicken> http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/23081985.jpg
*ScootaChicken leaves
<Meanwhile> So you can see what you've said as it appears to someone else. :D
<applejack096> SUPERBRONY64!!!!!!!
<cow334> ,=,O-O
<Phase4> 00,02ohai ScootaChicken
<ScootaChicken> Sup
<Meanwhile> Allo Nail.
<Cypresswolf> I'm quite colorful (in text) to mod point of view
<applejack096> Hi chicken
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi SuperBrony64
<sonicandmario85> Phase4:how will explorer.exe yell at you? does it open up a window saying dont do it?
<Phase4> 00,02sonicandmario85, it simply says its an invalid filename
<applejack096> Hey SB remember meeee! :)
<Cypresswolf> so many colors
<Meanwhile> Yfw SuperBrony64 hasn't even said anything...
<TheRandomkid321> I know have mah mario hat on :D
<Phase4> 00,02most of the win32 api simply doesnt care
<Meanwhile> And is probably not even at his keyboard.
<Phase4> 00,02you'd have to Make it care, and that meens checks everywhere
<Obsidian> Hello there everypony
<Meanwhile> Allo Obsidian.
<shana> Phase4: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=nfnNHiz0
<applejack096> Hey phase4s on skype!
<sonicandmario85> *mines obsidian and makes a nether portal*XD
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02shana, its the authority bit
<Saturn> 08,01worth noting: actual orgies happen in #stupidsexytwilight
<Phase4> 00,02only difference
<Cypresswolf> Do the color of each name mean anything or just random?
<shana> Phase4: also host
<TheRandomkid321> Obsidian is the best rock IRL... SO smooth... Like glass
<Phase4> 00,02which yours lacks
<applejack096> lol
<applejack096> soo AMUSING
<Meanwhile> Worth noting: Only you and Nyria are into that stuff.
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm afraid I must take off folks. I'll be back shortly.
<ScootaChicken> And FlareChaser, apparently
<Obsidian> Later Everlasting_Joy
<sonicandmario85> what are you debugging for phase4?
<Meanwhile> Figures.
<shana> Phase4: if you clean the host part, does it work? e.g. do a setHost("") or something
<applejack096> Yawn
<Phase4> 00,02shana, no way to set hostname
<Phase4> 00,02i did it manualy via the debugger, now it seems to be stuck somewhere
<sonicandmario85> unless you probally hack it XD
<Bronysith> http://trollfacecomic.com/post/5770023211/troll-comics-usb-troll-rageguycomic-rage
<Phase4> 00,02that seems to have worked
<Phase4> 00,02now its deadlocked
<Meanwhile> So Phase4, what're you actually trying to do?
<applejack096> This music is kinda boring no offence or anything cuz u like it but COME N!!
<Cypresswolf> Actually, before I go - did anyone watch National Geographic this week? There was some documentary scenario about what we would do if attacked by intergalactic aliens...
<applejack096> random
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, debug something
<TheRandomkid321> What?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, it *worked* but it dies elsewhere now
<applejack096> Who me????!!!
<TheRandomkid321> applejack096 You called?
<applejack096> no
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<Meanwhile> Cypresswolf: I did not see that but I wish I did.
<Phase4> 00,02might have to over-ride getCodeBase
<Phase4> 00,02urgh
<TheRandomkid321> applejack096 well sy somethin like That is random next time will ya?
<Phase4> 00,021am
<Cypresswolf> There was something I found quite perplexing - that WE (some scientists) have declared mathematics as the universal language - think about that for a moment :)
<Phase4> 00,02sleep/code/game?
<applejack096> I sed random because Cypresswolf was random TheRandomkid321
<TheRandomkid321> Phase4 HOLY CRAP IT IS!
<Meanwhile> No/No/Yes.
<sonicandmario85> applejack096:You Cannot Go Alone Take This With You.*gives a tiny fluttershy*
<Phase4> 00,02TheRandomkid321, utc+10 bro's /)
<shana> Phase4: does the url returned by getCodeBase also contain a host part?
<Chrysalis> Cypresswolf how is that perplexing, we use the damn things
<shana> Phase4: or is it just the new Url(url, "foo") bit that has the host part set?
<Chrysalis> we use it, we define it
<TheRandomkid321> Uhh yeah.. (\
<Saturn> 08,01let wrek know im looking for him when hes on
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> k
<Phase4> 00,02checking
<Bronysith> ok pluto
<Meanwhile> Will do Saturn.
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02too early
<shana> hm never had such a deadlock
<Phase4> 00,02need to check that deadlock if you use too early
<DarkStar> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAKaym1gx3I&feature=bf_next&list=LLPAvCXct1pg-6eaOAgJ3flg
<applejack096> What do you mean cannot go alone *Adores the tiny fluttershy* ahhhhh thx sonicandmario85!
<Vordox> Lolita paint chat...?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, the one where it *worked* wasnt actually a deadlock, the window poped up behind eclipse
<Vordox> =P
<Cypresswolf> In the show, we found creatures on this planet respond to math - but we have not had outside contact by aliens at all - furthest weve gotten is Mars through robotics - not counting whatever that satelite that recently exited the solar system....
<valoreins> i did not hit her its not true its bullshit i did not hit her... I DID NAAHT... Ohai bronystate
<Phase4> 00,02shana, url has the authority and host bit
<shana> Phase4: I'd consider that a java bug..
<Cypresswolf> How can we truly confirm math as a Universal language based on studies on this single planet?
<Phase4> 00,02probably
<applejack096> Ok wat wuz the mini fluttershy for sonicandmario85 its adorable but why!!
<TheRandomkid321> My mario hat makes my head itch :(
<sonicandmario85> applejack096:i dont know XD
<applejack096> lollllollllipop!!!!!
<applejack096> Hey SB TALK!!!!!
<valoreins> wat mini fluttershy?
<applejack096> Plz
<applejack096> Nm valoreins
<sonicandmario85> im watching power rangers samurai in real life right now
<applejack096> lol
<Cypresswolf> We still dont know if there are any intelligent life out there - we can speculate based on the numer of stars & planets, but we have no clue - odds considering, we know its possible
<applejack096> someone put decent music on plz
<Saturn> 08,01i beg to differ
<sonicandmario85> RANGERS TOGHETHER SAMURAI FOREVER!
<Meanwhile> I beg you do not share anyone elses name.
<Meanwhile> Mighty Morphing > All.
<Phase4> 00,02the url it returns when running from eclipse is different
<valoreins> i wonder what would the american version of the new super sentai that have a spy theme...
<Phase4> 00,02the crap is going on
<shana> Phase4: huh?
<shana> Phase4: how did you run it before?
<sonicandmario85> i like mighty morphin best but i like some of the other ones like zeo in space and samurai those are all the ones i like including mighty morphin
<Phase4> 00,02shana, from pframe
<Phase4> 00,02i meen running from eclipse in its applet viewer
<Saturn> 08,01im not
<sonicandmario85> i miss zordon..
<Cypresswolf> the entire documentary was a War of the Worlds scenario using tactics like Gorilla warfare to fight back once our planets manufacturing, military and communication goes - first half hour rules our weaponry useless against the aliens - interstellar travel > earth weapons
<Saturn> 08,01all you need to do is join the channel anyway
<Cypresswolf> though, they didn't mention bio weaponry...or at least I missed that part - give the aliens a cold
<Phase4> 00,02shana, it has a custom getCodeBase /)_-
<Chrysalis> though not everyone in that channel is involed
<sonicandmario85> PONYS TOGHETHER HARMONY FOREVER! xD
<Meanwhile> If there is anything I did not want to happen today it's find a list of folks who rp orgy.
<Phase4> 00,02how insanely strange
<sonicandmario85> GO GO PONY RANGERS
<Saturn> 08,01actually, the channels mainly just for talking about sex and sexuality
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i change the string litteral from file:// to file:/ and it seems to work
<shana> Phase4: I'd suggest a fix like this: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=MT2zuquZ (untested)
<Saturn> 08,01but rp orgies sometimes happen
<shana> oO
<Cypresswolf> I though aliens beneath National Geographic, but hey why not, we have the CDC preparing for possible zombie outbreak now
<Phase4> 00,02shana, AppletWatcher.java
<Meanwhile> You're not helping.
<Phase4> 00,02its a custom applet viewer
<sonicandmario85> BY JAVA
<TheRandomkid321> It juts mentioned christmas.... I ahet christmas.
<sonicandmario85> XD
<TheRandomkid321> *hate
<Phase4> 00,02stupid codebase
<Saturn> 08,01ill shut up about it
<Phase4> 00,02too large and obfuscated and confusing and java does not help
<Meanwhile> Thankyou.
<Funkballs> Hi everypony.
<Phase4> 00,02all fixed now
<Funkballs> oh sweet what are we developing?
<sonicandmario85> hello :3
<Saturn> 08,01this isnt the place to discuss that anyway
<Starflash> Meh.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> derp
<Funkballs> Java applets?
<Saturn> 08,01paradoxically, SST is...
<alexxm> Funkballs coding i think
<sonicandmario85> GO GO PONY RANGERS
<Funkballs> I see that. It's java in eclipse
<Funkballs> but what are we coding?
<Obsidian> Need to go. Night be back later. Bye everypony.
<Cypresswolf> Im out - let yall know what I find this time
<TheRandomkid321> It... REALLY pains me to vote on rage comics... But someones gotta do it.
<shana> Phase4: strange that it works, so file://C:/foo does not work, but file:/C:/foo does?
<TheRandomkid321> PEOPLE Y U NO REALISE THAT JOKES THAT DONT REACH A LARGE VARIETY OF PEOPLE ARNT FUNNY!?
<Vordox> Phase4: Is there any logs saved between PMs in this Irc?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, yes
<Meanwhile> Turtles.
<Bluestrom_S> ahh cool you guys to version control
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, i dont know
<Vordox> Phase4: GOVERNMENTS!
<sonicandmario85> Princess Celestia:DUNGEON 13 HOURS
<sonicandmario85> XD
<shana> Vordox: you mean wether ponychat stores the logs?
<Vordox> yes
<PonyNegZero> I don't believe so...
<Phase4> 00,02thats fixed
<Phase4> 00,02look at deadlock or sleep...
<Phase4> 00,02quick look at deadlock
<Bluestrom_S> what version on tortoise do you guys use Phase4 ?
<sonicandmario85> Phase4:what are you debugging for?
<Phase4> 00,02sonicandmario85, paintchat
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> he's trying to fix paintchat
<Phase4> 00,02Bluestrom_S, tortise svn and tortise git
<sonicandmario85> i tried going there but it whould just load and not go there
<Phase4> 00,02as for the actual version, nearly latest but i cbf downloading the update
<Bluestrom_S> cool
<Phase4> 00,02dont realy like it anyway, git > tortise git
<Bluestrom_S> tortoise svn in pretty awesome
<Phase4> 00,02stupid windows cmd.exe mishandles stdin
<shana> I use git command line tools, and gitk/git gui
<shana> they come with the standard git distribution
<shana> pretty awesome toolset
<Bronysith> http://bronysith.deviantart.com/art/chocolate-dipped-potato-crisps-312580317
<Funkballs> the new github gui for windows is surprisingly nice.
<shana> Phase4: windows git comes with mingw and bash iirc
<Phase4> 00,02shana, yes but it cant accept passwords via the terminal
<shana> Funkballs: never looked at it, can you compare it to gitk or git gui?
<Funkballs> previously I just used the command line one and some eclipse plugins.
<Phase4> 00,02tbh if i'm in a position where i need a gui, i'm pushing to a bitbucket or github repo
<Phase4> 00,02so i can just use the websites
<XAX> I think we can all agree the Opera Duck was the best part of Ponies the anthology II
<Phase4> 00,02inb4 i'm in that position and internets not avaliable
<sonicandmario85> KRBALS
<sonicandmario85> KERBALS*
<shana> Phase4: have you tried the official git gui?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, nope
<sonicandmario85> THEY ARE INVADING YOUR DESKTOP PHASE4 :o
<Phase4> 00,02sonicandmario85, that they are
<Phase4> 00,02i'll explode them soon :P
<pony_4234> java?
<Funkballs> it's very clean and fast. Not sure if it works with non github repos though.
<sonicandmario85> Phase4:try to go to the moon when you do and crash land on the moon :D
<Phase4> 00,02oh god, its not seriously halting for that reason is it
<Funkballs> very easy to see whats changed and manage multiple branches and stuff
*Phase4 00,02think he;s found the deadlock
<shana> Phase4: hm thread.sleep is milliseconds, right?
<shana> or was it floating point seconds..
<Phase4> 00,02Funkballs, it should work with any git repo, github does nothing spesific
<Funkballs> I think it'
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saeriously has anyone caught the MLP theme faintly playing at the start of Daddy Discord?
<Funkballs> ss milli
<Phase4> 00,02shana, in miliseconds, theres probably a float overload though
<shana> anyway using Thread.sleep when waiting for a lock is pretty bad
<sonicandmario85> one small step for kerbal XD
<shana> there's Thread.wait for that
<Phase4> 00,02and just like that
<Phase4> 00,02the deadlock is gone
<Phase4> 00,02and i did nothing
<Phase4> 00,02[buy some apples] you java
*PonyNegZero nuzzles Phase4.
*Phase4 00,02hugs PonyNegZero back
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: Java loves you too.
<sonicandmario85> Phase4:whats paintchat for? can you paint pictures or something on it?
<Phase4> 00,02i stand by my opinion that there is a way to do java wel
<Phase4> 00,02well'
<Phase4> 00,02but that sun decided not to do that and oracle is not gona help
<TheRandomkid321> That was mildly peculiar...
<Funkballs> lol
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.bronystate.net/paintchat/
<shana> the java language hasn't gotten a lot of new features
<Phase4> 00,02TheRandomkid321, chat derp?
<TheRandomkid321> No... My computer settings reset randomly?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, yeah, but to be fair the language is prety much assembler for the bytecode
<shana> ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02compiler does bugger all from what i've seen
<TheRandomkid321> Just a moment guys.
<Funkballs> only new language feature I can think of is the error handling being able to put multiple exceptions in one catch statement.
<cow334> Phase4: ,=,e
<shana> javavm is probably the fastest vm there is..
<TheRandomkid321> I cant pause the stream? WHAT THE BUCK!?
<Phase4> 00,02fun fact: the server is running here at my hose
<TheRandomkid321> Wait its good
<Phase4> 00,02shana, not realy, .net exceeds it in anything memory heavy
<Phase4> 00,02they just spent a LOT of money making hotspot fast
<Phase4> 00,02same amount of effort on .net would yield more results
<shana> Phase4: ah ok, my sources are from http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programming-languages-are-fastest.php
<Phase4> 00,02suddenly clients
<cow334> Phase4: Wait so is the paint chat open or is it closed for right now? or as of now or is it open
<shana> Phase4: but the microsoft vm is probably not listed there
<Phase4> 00,02shana, mono is about as fast as it anyway
<Phase4> 00,02about to exceed it
<PonyNegZero> brb
<Vordox> Oy Phase4 ....
<Phase4> 00,02not sure what benchmark they use
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Vordox
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> so confusing
<Vordox> I want to see you program as fast as this guy can play. :P
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azmASqYPNc
<Vordox> In case you wish to see it.
<shana> Phase4: you can view the sourcecode for the benchmarks here: http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=nbody&lang=java&id=2
<Vordox> THAT is the speed I want to draw...or program, or anything
<TheRandomkid321> Okay back
<Phase4> 00,02listening to music, will play after Vordox
<Vordox> Ok. :)
<Funkballs> that's kinda surprising. I woulda thought the overhead from the JVM would make JAVA slower than that
<Funkballs> lower down the list
<Vordox> All you need is love....Hum hum humh...Isn't that one of the Beatles?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, that benchmark is very impractical
<Phase4> 00,02for java that is
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, yup
<String_Shredder> Vordox: you don't say?
<shana> Phase4: why?
<Vordox> String_Shredder: I only know 3 songs from Beatles. :p
<cow334> all you need is love
<cow334> daw
<Phase4> 00,02shana, double, int, byte and something else are vm internals
<cow334> <3
<cow334> WAIT
<Phase4> 00,02not objects
<cow334> i didnt want that heart
<Meanwhile> Dat kick
<TheRandomkid321> All you need is love... And water.... and Blood... And food.... And a spleen.... And lungs.... And a heart.... And one kidney... and your intestines... and your brain... and you stomach... and your liver...and your spine...
<cow334> Meanwhile: lawl
<sonicandmario85> dat mega zord
<Phase4> 00,02in practice you create a lot of objects, and all objects in java are heap alocated
<Meanwhile> cow334: :3
<shana> Phase4: yeah I see what you mean
<cow334> TheRandomkid321: i think they coverd that part of the story lawl
<cow334> Meanwhile: ,=,e
<Phase4> 00,02gc pauses get out of hand real fast
<Meanwhile> cow334: Turtle. :D
<sonicandmario85> I SAW THE KERBALS THEY ARE GETTING WORSE!
<Vordox> This guy is CRAZY
<cow334> Meanwhile: yup :)
<Vordox> But THAT'S how fast I want to program. XD
<TheRandomkid321> Skill level : ASIAN!
<sonicandmario85> THEY ARE DESTROYING HIS FILES D:
<rdibp> :O
<rdibp> hai
<Meanwhile> Daaaaaaamn.
<Vordox> This is one of the most famous videos on the internet, pre Torrent
<cow334> HOLY SHIT
<Vordox> SUPER MODE ACTIVATE
<sonicandmario85> WOAH

<sonicandmario85> IMPOSSIBLE!
<cow334> just kidding
<rdibp> asians
<Meanwhile> Now play an actual piano.
<Vordox> So yeah Phase4 ....Program that fast. :P
<Meanwhile> Seriously, I bet on a real piano he'd be fantastic.
<cow334> Phase4: i cant hear anything on the stream
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, his hands are made of speed
<rdibp> IMPOSSIBRU
<wicked> cool:)
<Vordox> Phase4: XD LOL
<cow334> wait okay i got it
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, your end
<sonicandmario85> its called crazy japanese guy.. and its a kid XD
<Vordox> Like holy crap...
<Vordox> Seriously...
<cow334> Phase4: it's okay it started to make sound again
<Vordox> LOOOOOOOOOOL!
<Vordox> Look at this SCORE
<cow334> Holy shit like seriously
<Vordox> He ranked THIRD! XD
<TheRandomkid321> DAT SCOORE!
<Vordox> Who the FUCK IS FIRST?!
<wicked> asian? more like japanese
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, thats a heck of a thought
<PonyNegZero> What did I miss?
<Vordox> Phase4: ^^
<Vordox> That's for the video...
<TheRandomkid321> PonyNegZero Asians doing Asian stuff
<Vordox> Still I want to see you program that fast someday :P
<Vordox> Make it happen!
<Phase4> 00,02wish i could
<PonyNegZero> TheRandomkid321: fair enough
<wicked> he's good
<Phase4> 00,02programings not realy about typing though
<PonyNegZero> needs more tableflipping
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Jesus ranked first.
<Vordox> Phase4: It's about prethinking, then put it to work
<cow334> replay the video
<cow334> please
<rdibp> plox
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azmASqYPNc

<Phase4> 00,02shana, nice version
<Funkballs> yay null pointers :D
<alexxm> Chrysalis that video has a need for speed
<shana> Phase4: :) it's weechat
<Phase4> 00,02shana, you have icedtea installed?
<wicked> who wants to PARTY!!!:O
<shana> Phase4: yeah, it's my main java jdk/jre

<TheRandomkid321> Umm I havnt been on on sunday mornings for a while but souldnt the aquabats be coming on? Or is that series finished?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, not yet, need to make a stand-alone one

<Meanwhile> TheRandomkid321 I'm willing to believe Golakka is probably on friendly terms with Saturn.
<Zetheross> anyone here going to canterlot gardens?
<TheRandomkid321> Meanwhile... Yeah... Perhaps...
<Straisin> alexxm: oh, where's my manners? and how's your day going?

<Meanwhile> I very much doubt Golakka goes around randomly telling people to take days off.
<Dovah> I haz fud! :)
<TheRandomkid321> M chest is very hollow... Is taht normal?
<Funkballs> dat cygwin
<alexxm> TheRandomkid321 i don't know sorry
<TheRandomkid321> Probably where my heart used to be.
<Phase4> 00,02DEBUGGING
<Phase4> 00,02and scp
<Meanwhile> SCP as in containment breach?
<shana> Meanwhile: secure copy
<Phase4> 00,02as in secure copy
<Phase4> 00,02shana, /)
<TheRandomkid321> Scp? God I hate that "creepypasta" series.... I jst don't get it.
<sonicandmario85> Phase4:try making it to where you can upload a picture on the chat XD
<Meanwhile> Much less interesting.
<Funkballs> it's liuke ftp over ssh
<shana> Phase4: (\
<cow334> ,=,e
<cow334> it's a turtle
<Straisin> likely story >:(
<TheRandomkid321> cow334 ----- its a worm BICH!
<cow334> TheRandomkid321: ,=,O-O YOU FAIL
<shana> Funkballs: not quite, sftp is like ftp over ssh
<cow334> this is a worm
<cow334> ____
<Funkballs> I thought sftp was ssl?
<Phase4> 00,02TheRandomkid321, tell me
<shana> Funkballs: that's ftps
<Phase4> 00,02do you like bananas?
<Funkballs> I seee
<sonicandmario85> fuckin barrels...
<TheRandomkid321> <( ^^) It's a sperm
<shana> Funkballs: with sftp you can copy, download, move, create directories, etc. pp
<TheRandomkid321> BARRELS!?
<cow334> TheRandomkid321: shh
<cow334> no more
<TheRandomkid321> cow334... Okay...
<Meanwhile> ▲
<Meanwhile> ▲ ▲
<CrimsonPhoenix> TheRandomkid321, do you like bananas?
<alexxm> so next weeks movie night looks good
<Meanwhile> Nice going top triangle.
<TheRandomkid321> Yeah
<TheRandomkid321> Yeah I do
<cow334> TheRandomkid321: k :)
<Funkballs> whereas scp only copies?
<Meanwhile> Way to land like, two feet from the right of where you appear in the chat box.
<Meanwhile> ▲
<Meanwhile> ▲ ▲
<RX-78-SweetieBot> And then meanwhile was a newfoal for about a minute
<Starflash> The top triangle dun wanna triforce.
<shana> Phase4: try 'AddType application/java-archive jar' in apache
<Meanwhile> Eh, I don't have it set right on my source.
<Phase4> 00,02shana, thx ^_^
<TheRandomkid321> Try uhm... /fixeverything
<Meanwhile> And if I recall it doesn't land properly in mane chat like that anyway
<sonicandmario85> i like to kill barrels :3
<TheRandomkid321> I SHALL DESTROY ALL BARRELZ!
<Phase4> 00,02now to wait 2 hours untill cloudflare re-caches the file
<alexxm> TheRandomkid321 good luck
<Meanwhile> ▲
<Meanwhile> ▲ ▲
<Straisin> ah, I haven't been on EQD for a while now
<Meanwhile> ▲
<Meanwhile> ▲ ▲
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, tri-fail on my screen
<shana> Funkballs: scp is good for command line, to upload a file,folder or download a file/folder - sftp is good for interactive use or multiple file upload/download change permissions etc.
<TheRandomkid321> LAWL!
<Meanwhile> Your screen is irrelevant.
<Straisin> any thing that isn't related to an elephant is irrelephant
<CrimsonPhoenix> well shit guys http://i.imgur.com/UNHcT.png what should I choose?
<Meanwhile> ▲
<Meanwhile> ▲ ▲
<Straisin> majora's mask
<Jim> Newfoals can't triforce
<Straisin> me says
<Meanwhile> Hush Jim
<Phase4> 00,02CrimsonPhoenix, jpg because png is a bit large for this kinda image
<Meanwhile> I need to see it on Phases screen
<Funkballs> shana: yeah I see that now. What misled me was the winscp client for windows which actually defaults to sftp for just about everything.
<Unnr|Laptop> Meanwhile can't triforce? O_o
<shana> CrimsonPhoenix: if you haven't played majoras mask then that
<sonicandmario85> CrimsonPhoenix:super mario kart :3
<alexxm> CrimsonPhoenix one of the games i giess
<Phase4> 00,02or a better png compressor
<Meanwhile> ▲
<CrimsonPhoenix> well it's hyperdesktop so heh
<Phase4> 00,02CrimsonPhoenix, i'd say majoras mask
<Straisin> ^
<shana> Funkballs: yeah I think the name winscp is there for historical reasons, e.g. before sftp existed
<Meanwhile> And that one is denied by the message blocker.
<Funkballs> I use scp from the command line but I guess I never noticed it didn't hand't anything bu file transfers.
<Meanwhile> Meeeeeeeeeh.
<Straisin> listen to the man with the highlighted text CrimsonPhoenix
<Funkballs> *handle anything but
<Phase4> 00,02CrimsonPhoenix, if you've played it i'd get the posters
<CrimsonPhoenix> Straisin, I know I'm just sayan
<Meanwhile> Oh well, guess Phase4 is forever unforced.
<Phase4> 00,02lol Meanwhile
<TheRandomkid321> http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/343214-60s-spider-man
<Phase4> 00,02that single triangle is in the right place for a triforce i think
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I have played Majora mask before but haven't completed it. I did however watch the whole game
<Straisin> CrimsonPhoenix, oh xD
<SEGAdude> hello
<Phase4> 00,02ohai
<alexxm> CrimsonPhoenix well which one do you want
<alexxm> hey SEGAdude hows your day been
<CrimsonPhoenix> I must say I' kinda tempt to get the playing cards
<Meanwhile> Allo SEGAdude
<CrimsonPhoenix> then again still unsure
<SEGAdude> crappy
<SEGAdude> stupid
<SEGAdude> kill worthy
<Straisin> they made another "where the hell is matt"?
<Jim> CrimsonPhoenix: Get the posters!
*Unnr|Laptop Sees SEGAdude's nic and the *SEGA* sound from the genesis days plays in their head
<Jim> Straisin: Yeah, 2012, we watched it earlier
<Straisin> nnnuuuuuhh
<alexxm> CrimsonPhoenix well most of those games are from before i started gaming so i never had the chance to play them so sorry
<Straisin> Jim: curses, I guess I came in late
<CrimsonPhoenix> alexxm, play them they're great
<Jim> you should definately check it out, it is beautiful
<CrimsonPhoenix> ...okay except for return of samus and Mario vs Donkey Kong
<Straisin> I'd like to learn how to code too Q_Q, and will do Jim
<Unnr|Laptop> To be fair, OoT is fairly ugly with current generations
<alexxm> CrimsonPhoenix i will if i can find them for a realtily cheap price
<CrimsonPhoenix> Just emulate~
<String_Shredder> ▲
<CrimsonPhoenix> YARR HARR FIDDLE DE DEE
<String_Shredder> ▲▲
<alexxm> ok
<Phase4> 00,02Straisin, download python, go on the internet and start learning
<Unnr|Laptop> CrimsonPhoenix is a parrot
<Straisin> being a pirate is allright to be!
<CrimsonPhoenix> a lite one
<Unnr|Laptop> SQUAK!
<Phase4> 00,02or ruby, people recomend ruby but i'm yet to learn it
<Funkballs> I like python.
<Straisin> Phase4: thanks, I've managed to get my hands on a few C++ books, but I'll give that a shot too
*Gunny is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
<shana> I have looked at ruby, its a neat language but its documentation really sucks
<Meanwhile> Now see that's Newfoals can't Triforce.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't like, dowanload 360 games and burn them in cds then play them on a modded xbox 360
<shana> also there are tons more libraries for python
<Unnr|Laptop> Python is nice as it teaches you good tabbing habits
<MadSurge> Good afternoon Bronystate!!!
<Funkballs> c++ is a bit heavy on the memory management stuff for a beginner I think
<Straisin> heya MadSurge
<Phase4> 00,02Straisin, c++ is probably not where you want to start
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> can I post link to song I made?
<Funkballs> Java is nice to start out too
<Cypresswolf> I got some good finds today :)
<Phase4> 00,02do a bit in an easier language, once you have the basic concepts you can start c++
<Funkballs> learn OO stuff
<FairysHuff> Hallo
<TheRandomkid321> http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/masonry/000/332/257/704.gif
<Straisin> Phase4, gotcha
<Meanwhile> Allo MadSurge
<Vordox> Phase4: Want another crazy video? This one is more of a YTMPV though with a music... :P
<Jim> Spiderman is best pony
<Funkballs> actually... theres a really good interactive learn to program site...
<shana> python has got some nice functinal programming stuff :)
<Eleanor> hey random strangers from internets
<alexxm> hey FairysHuff and MadSurge hows your day been
<Funkballs> teaches you javascript but is really good...
<shana> lambda, list comprehension, iterators..
<Phase4> 00,02i'm thinking bed
<sonicandmario85> LOL
<Funkballs> hang on lemmie see if I can find it
<alexxm> hey Eleanor hows your day been
<Vordox> Phase4: Sounds good too XD
<MadSurge> Allo Meanwhile, Straisin, alexxm and FairysHuff!
<Vordox> Lawl Spiderman
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, YTPMV are always with music

<FairysHuff> alexxm Meh. Been in a bad mood all day cause of lack of sleep.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> http://tinyurl.com/72qxg29 me singing a seapony version of "Strawberry Fields" titled Strawberry Seas
<alexxm> fluttershy wins fatality
<Phase4> 00,02shana, pull from bitbucket, make sure your up to date
<Vordox> Well I'll link it once Phase goes to bed. :9
<Funkballs> http://codeyear.com/ - they send you interactive things to teach you how to code. It's really good.
<Meanwhile> Phase4: you're*
<Phase4> 00,02shana, also can you quickly check the url change doesn't break linux?
<shana> Phase4: oki I'm on it
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, its 2:10, i can say your all i want :P
<d3rb> still streaming Phase4 far out
<Phase4> 00,02d3rb, none of the other streamers are awake/avaliable
<Meanwhile> Phase4: Given the context of the spelling error, saying that I'm all you want could be taken the wrong way.
<Straisin> Funkballs: I've been trying out http://www.codecademy.com, but it isn't providing much new information to me so far
<Vordox> This one will probably make you go tired, Phase4 XD
<d3rb> lazy bastards
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, fair enough
<Vordox> Recommend you see it before going to bed, and hope you like Eminiem
<Funkballs> Straisin: yeah that codeyear thing is the same as codeacademy
<sonicandmario85> you're may be the correct way to say your but you dont even need to do it...
<Meanwhile> Phase4: Of course, if I /am/ all you want I'll be sure to visit in your dreams. :P
<Funkballs> it's a program they run I think
<Cypresswolf> Found Talking Cadence, CMC Flower Friends & 3 blind bags - Talking Cadence according to my sources isnt expected for another month ^_^
<Funkballs> great for beginners
<Vordox> SO I HEARD CADANCE IS IN S3!!!!
<Straisin> Funkballs: aha, I probably just haven't gotten far into the course to get new information then
<String_Shredder> Vordox: I listened to Eminem back when he was Slim Shady *hipster glasses*
<Phase4> 00,02o_O
<Funkballs> I haven't found much new info for me there either to be honest but if you hadn't programmed anything before I'd think it would be pretty useful
<Jim> Will the real Slim Shady please stand up
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, source
*String_Shredder sits down
<Meanwhile> No.
<Cypresswolf> Still no Toys R Us exclusives though
<TheRandomkid321> YEs I'm gonna continue posting random images taht involve spiderman and ponys... problem? http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/masonry/000/310/832/740.png

<Jim> TheRandomkid321: No problem, I enjoy spiderponies
<Straisin> Funkballs: I've learnt a bit of things from http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/, but I'm just trying to get the very basics of coding down atm
<cow334> Speed is my game
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ3zu6jHGm0 <--- The last video I recommend for you. :P It's completely random and VERY VERY Bad video. XD BUt hey! Challenges, mister Phase4 !(Also last video I put here during stream.... Kick me after :P)

<EspyLacopa> Boooo.
<RaveBrony> Sir_Brony: :'(
*MadSurge doesn't really understand why Angry Birds is popular
<derpy_pony> celestia radio plays these songs all the time
<anon3mous345> and 20% cooler
<RaveBrony> MadSurge: Nor do i....
<WindWhistler> You'd think I'd be used to this, considering I keep getting interrupted IRL
<WindWhistler> and ignored.
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler: That's just paranoid, I only got one hello when I joined earlier.
<sonicandmario85> MadSurge:its fun though XD
<Jim> Because casual games
<Sir_Brony> http://lilmisswaffles.deviantart.com/#/d55l05r :D

<MadSurge> WindWhistler: that, I understand :D
<Meanwhile> Yay.
<Lil_B> MadSurge RaveBrony stay away from any Angry Birsds news you will every see... this company thinks (and thats an actual statement by them) that they will be as big as Disney in a few years
<WindWhistler> I get interrupted so often I often have a minor fit every time it happens.
<alexxm> really Lil_B
<RaveBrony> Lil_B: Wtf!?! Roflmao! :D

*Jim shrugpony
<WindWhistler> EspyLacopa: That can't be Cirno...where's her wings? And why are her eyes red?
<EspyLacopa> Cirno is a touhou thing.
<MadSurge> EspyLacopa: but that's the girl from Evangalion o__o
<derpy_pony> never played angry birds. is it a flash game?
<WindWhistler> And she doesn't have a bow in her hair.
<EspyLacopa> ^_^
<prince-dari> I don't find Angry Birds addicting at all, it's alright to do if you have nothing else to do
<WindWhistler> I knew it! It's not Cirno.
<EspyLacopa> MadSurge: That's the joke.
<Kandarihu> Wow. That's one vertical screengrab area
<Meanwhile> What dari said.
<TheRandomkid321> prince-dari everyone has their opinions

<MadSurge> Hey prince-dari!
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Great. What's Touhou?
<WindWhistler> MadSurge: SHE.
<PonyNegZero> prince-dari: I have enough things to do, I don't need Angry Birds...
<Sir_Brony> I beg to differ, the computer version sucks but the smart phone versions are addicting
<WindWhistler> Meanwhile: A very popular Japanese game series.
<WindWhistler> It's a shmup.
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler: Oh ok then.

<Sir_Brony> I just got back wow
<Dken2021> welcome back Sir_Brony
<MegaMoonShine> wb Sir_Brony :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Is this Basshunter?
<Jim> Think so
<Nyst> My guess is that the jet exhaust burns off the tail. That, or the stress from the acceleration burns it off
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause it sounds like his style...
<Sir_Brony> Thanks but wow, those poor kerbals
<Jim> it's swedish atleast
<Dken2021> Sir_Brony no worries, they were paid for this job
<Chibi_Loves_Parties> Lolnope
<anon3mous345> boom
<CrimsonPhoenix> not only it's swedish but the beat and all, it has a basshunter feel
<MegaMoonShine> Ded
<Sir_Brony> They don't pay them enough
<Chaser> That didn't end well...
<Nyst> To run, one must first learn to crawl. And to get to space, one must first die horribly in a giant fireball.
<Sir_Brony> now that you mention it phoenix your right they do
<sonicandmario85> which is da sun
<sonicandmario85> XD
<MegaMoonShine> Nyst: But then how do they get to space when they are dead?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yay for poniez ^-^
<Barbetos|Atwork> ^
<Jim> yay for SuperBrony64

<Dken2021> looks like the ship is.... winging it.
<RaveBrony> Hiya SuperBrony64 :)
*SuperBrony64 hugs PonyNegZero

<MegaMoonShine> hello Eztio-- :)
<Jim> http://i.imgur.com/Kvr3p.png
<Nyst> I never managed to get to the Mun :( I could make a rocket that'd fly out far enough, but it would always be in a different place.
<MegaMoonShine> Sir_Brony: Aww why are you sad? :(
<Chibi_Loves_Parties> Ee'yup
<Chrysalis> Jim those poor children
<PonyNegZero> Chrysalis: Well played.
<Starflash> Whoa...

<AttacktheAndalite> Hey gusy, I'm only gonna be able to stay for a few minutes but what's up?
<Jim> AttacktheAndalite: Genocide!
<Chaser> not much, you?
<DashieMusic2> if you watched heroes in the past few days, what episode did you leave off on?
<Nyst> Question: can you detach parts in airplane mode the way you can in rocket mode?
<Sir_Brony> Alright I feel better now.
<PonyNegZero> rave-tail is full of party
<Dken2021> hmm, network seems jittery as of late
<AttacktheAndalite> Jim: Genocide? Whut/
<Chaser> So many thrusters
<Nyst> Because I wonder if you could make a rocket that starts out with wings, launches horizontally, and then pulls up and throws off it's wings.
<Jim> Kerbals are being murdered
<Jim> as usual
<AttacktheAndalite> Ahh.
<Sir_Brony> Turns out I just had to vomit... and it went EVERYWHERE

<Nyst> Whoa it barely cleared the pad.
<MegaMoonShine> Is it just me or is the game lagging?

<Chibi_Loves_Parties> Just a little
<Nyst> The game can really take it out of a pc.
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ I can has a dino park with RC3 - by the way...doesn anypony want to visit my theme park? :P
<MegaMoonShine> That it can
<Nyst> My pc isn't terrible but it suffers from this game (the demo)
<Sir_Brony> Alright I think I'm good now
<Nyst> Probably in the same way DF murders computers, not in graphics but in all the calculations.
<Chaser> Those are some giant wings...
<Unnr|Laptop> Mmm, DF
<Nyst> Oh man that plane looks cool.
<MegaMoonShine> ^
*Unnr|Laptop thinks BS needs to run a DF succession game
