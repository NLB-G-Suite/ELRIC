<Sergio_Scriptor> Darf14: i got one of those hats :) i wish they still worn those :'( now when i use them in my school everyone laughs at me...
<Wirisme> people aren't wearing enough hats
<Cades[Laptop]> lol
<SafariMonkey> wb Discord
<Quick_Thinker> damn mimes
<Shining-Star> this movie is why mimes scare me
<ScarecrowGanjalf> alexxm: 80's stylized on 40's
<Svettponny> Bob!!!1
<Discord> I haven't been on in a few weeks o.o
<Darf14> Nothing suspicious of that mime
<DB_Brony> "Maybe these mimes will speak up about Batman."
<Wirisme> seems legit
<Kandarihu> Kencolt, MoP?
<ScarecrowGanjalf> Suddenly Joker is the Penguin
<thelonepony> Joker!!!
<Discord> Safarimonkey I haven't been on in a few weeks.
<DB_Brony> xXQuickSC0pezXx
<thelonepony> ded
<Kencolt> Basically, 80's, with Burton trying for a Film Noir (40's) with a freakish supefuture (as he saw it-- 2020's) mix.
<SafariMonkey> Discord: Then you don't have a registered nick I guess
<mentallyeffedguy> epic kill

<Sergio_Scriptor> Stallion_of_War: the puns,the puns :D
<Darf14> I thought mimes use silencers
<ScarecrowGanjalf> Umm, Bruce... You don't have your bulletproof suit on, you know?
<JESmith71> Got QUILLED by the Joker
<Sergio_Scriptor> Darf14: :D that would make way to much sense
<Nyst> This Batman is really quite gobless

<Stallion_of_War> I wonder if the festival will be long
<DB_Brony> you know there is a better way to turn off the tv, right?
<Shining-Star> Wow he really made a dent on that tv
<Fl00t4hSh41> The pen is mightier than the sword, but bringing a few machineguns for backup don't hurt
<PartyCannon> lol
<ScarecrowGanjalf> dat line:D
<Quick_Thinker> :D
<EleanorAwesome> enema
<Star_Shadow> That's one way to turn off the tv
<Kencolt> Kandarihu: Mist of Pandaria, the new Expac for WoW-- for some reason, when I pre-ordered my copy of the new expansion, the clerk added, "oh, and'd here's your Beta Key, so you can get the hang of it." Ou tof NOWHERE.
<DB_Brony> Classic scene
<Klumzeedragon> Yum. Enemas.
<alexxm> eneamas for everyone
<PillowPoni> Hey guys
<Kandarihu> Mimes don't use props. They'll hold out their hands as if they're holding a gun, then behave as if they're facing some big recoil as they pretend they're firing their imaginary guns.
<Stallion_of_War> I have a feeling he's going to screw Gotham.
<PillowPoni> I'm back on the computer
<Kandarihu> Kencolt, I see.
<mentallyeffedguy> PillowPoni: good, enjoy the movie!
<Cades[Laptop]> i winder where shibaru is

<Shining-Star> tvs
<Darf14> This is why remotes were invented
<Cades[Laptop]> brb gonna go make some music
<Star_Shadow> That's one wa yto turn off the tv
<Canadian_Brony> How to turn off your TV in one simple step: shoot it.
<Cynder7> 6k ^^
<BaneSurge> Dat giant revolver
<Wirisme> It also works with lightbulbs
<Cades[Laptop]> actually never mind, ill just take my phone with me lol
<Fl00t4hSh41> Darf14: I prefer the jokes remote, it's more entertaining
<Klumzeedragon> And one more ding for you Ponies47. :)
<Cynder7> 6xD
<MrMalk> Canadian_Brony or use the remote infront of you
<Wirisme> Have one from me Ponies47
<Dark92Enigma> mentallyeffedguy: I ALREADY told you after they got in the batcave, where the sound of bats could be heard. It's not much of a spoiler
<mentallyeffedguy> i bought you a rose, fuck me right?!
<Shining-Star> Ding Dong
<Darf14> he went cheep on the flowers for a rich guy
<Dark92Enigma> Canadian_Brony: it only works one way, though
<mentallyeffedguy> Dark92Enigma: i was sure it was just soundeffects
<Canadian_Brony> MrMalk but that isn't one simple step! You have the gun, so you pull the trigger. With the remote, you'll have to lean over, pick it up, and push the button.
<Cynder7> 6DAMN MOSQUITOS! -.-

<mentallyeffedguy> poor crazy joker
<KalarMar> windows error? anyone
<Kurra> Stupid Joker.
<One> Prepare to die.
<BaneSurge> :D DAT NO SELL
*PinkieSpice does a George Takei "Oh mai"
<BaneSurge> MY PARENTS ARE DEAD
<Dark92Enigma> PURPLE IS BEST COLOR
<RosePetal1> Yes.
<otakon1> I made you, you made me first.
<BaneSurge> :D
<One> PinkieSpice, can't tell if jokesteal.
<Wirisme> Yes he would
<DB_Brony> AAAH
<Darf14> that would be a yes
<otakon1> grab
<Azuredragon> im sorry but Joker being the one who killed his parents is lame
<Dark92Enigma> HE WOULD :D
<BaneSurge> :D
<Wirisme> Kinda
<Darf14> :D
<Fl00t4hSh41> How the hell did the Joker know what batman was refering to when he said he killed his parents?
<KalarMar> pinke pie
<RosePetal1> Don't listen to the Joker vicki.
<Kurra> One thing though, Nicholson does the Joker laugh PERFECT.
<otakon1> Azuredragon: it's the same in the Batman TAS too
<DB_Brony> AAAAAH
<Dark92Enigma> Straaaaaight outta from looney toones
<RosePetal1> I dont know.
<otakon1> that girl is STUPID
<DerpyMuffins> Troll
<One> DAT F*CKING LAUGH! Yes, Korra, thanks for telling me.
<otakon1> Dark92Enigma: it IS Warner Bros.
<Dark92Enigma> *TUNES
<One> *Kurra
<PinkieSpice> while he busy playing around, he could have stepped on thier hands
<otakon1> PinkieSpice: not his style
<Dark92Enigma> otakon1: Thanks for reminding me
<Kurra> One, I could be the aquatic Avatar too, that's okay. |3
<Dark92Enigma> DAT GARGOYLE
<otakon> there we go
<BaneSurge> Inb4 Disney Villain Death
<brony90> is this batman begins or why does this scene looks similiar
<otakon> BaneSurge: hush!
<otakon> brony90: no it's Batman
<KalarMar> damn windows error
<One> Sure thing, Kurra.
<RosePetal1> Foreshadowing.
<PinkieSpice> idiot -_- paints joker more like a fool than a clown
<SafariMonkey> The joker's fall is physics-free
<Dark92Enigma> brony90: It's the classic 1989 Batman, the first movie
<otakon> famous last words
<Darf14> I smell foreshadowing
<otakon> FAMOUS LAST WORDS
<One> Epic Foreshado- OH FOR GOD'S SAKE IT COULDN'T BE MORE OBVIOUS!
<otakon> lol
<RosePetal1> Then Frolo falls on him.
<PinkieSpice> should have kicked them off while he could
<otakon> I wonder though WHY his leg didn't just cut off
<Kandarihu> Remember at the beginning, Joker was danging, and Batman tried to save him? Batman's doing the opposite here.
<KalarMar> scary
<Kurra> There is NO WAY he could hold that if it was real stone.
<mentallyeffedguy> dat leg
<Nittany_Discord> Yikes.
<Squallken> love this fall
<mentallyeffedguy> dat weight
<Kurra> that's like a Fiat 500's worth of rock.
<PinkieSpice> he falls to death now?
<RosePetal1> Eyeup.
<BaneSurge> DED
<One> Alright, RAISE YOUR HAND if you think the musician did a brilliant job for this movie.
<mentallyeffedguy> BaneSurge: no
<otakon> that stone statue must weigh several hundred pounds
<Obsidian> I guess now hes just....Dead weight
<Dark92Enigma> Derpy: I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT WENT WROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG
<DB_Brony> AAAAH
<otakon> One: agree
*ScarecrowGanjalf raises hand
<Kandarihu> Thereby, Batman gave Joker enough clues to uncover his secret identity. If the Joker lived long enough to put 2+2+2+2 together, he WOULD uncover Batman's secret identity.
<Kurra> his wrists and arms woulda snapped like rubber bands. O_O
*SafariMonkey raises hand
<nonody2> Batman dosent kill? Ookay?
<CaptainBatman> *raises hand*
<KalarMar> he did not leave a smile
<PinkieSpice> if he wasn't soo cocky, whe would have lived
<Azuredragon> The gargoyle killed him
<Derpy_Hooves> ...........
<Dark92Enigma> Obsidian: Ba dum tss
<otakon> Goliath killed The Joker
<mentallyeffedguy> quit screamin you bitch"!
<Maid_RainBow> Some times i can kill myself best famouse last words
<Fl00t4hSh41> It's elfman who made the music, so the awesomeness is a given
<otakon> she is Lady screams-alot
<Dark92Enigma> TRIVIA: That GARGOYLE was Actually Goliath
<Darf14> ......creepy

<EleanorAwesome> I love this show, anyone here heard of it?
<GaP> I'm best pony
<Wirisme> Big adventure
<Shining-Star> The great and powwerful trixie is hear :|
<Dark92Enigma> My thoughts, even for it's time, it still holds up as a timeless classic. The music plays very well with the enviroment, and sometimes, it's silenced so we can appreciate the atmosphere........even though other characters outside the Joker and Batman were less memorable, this still hoilds up. 8/10
<DB_Brony> Kurra, It's a pretty tame show without any sex or violence. It's good for comedy, you should try it out if you like that kind of stuff
<One> twilight_sprinkle: EXACTLY.
<Moopy> trixe is just a big show off
<Wirisme> Fraaaance
<GaP_Trixie> Best pony

<brony_90> nope.... its aMAREica

<Wirisme> Good evening HoodyNinja
<Hipster-Pony> NOPE IT'S 'MURCA
<pony_300> Streets olf Rage Football
<Petrified_Discord> I feel that in Starship Troopers, athletes are REQUIRED to take steroids. Make 'em the best they can, amirite? :D
<Nyst> So much testosterone.
<Hipster-Pony> STURODS
*HoodyNinja gives Wirisme a bucket
<MadSurge> Nyst: even between women
<Wirisme> A bucket? for me!?
*Hipster-Pony eats steroids
<Snowflake> bullshit!!! hes drinking redbull
<HoodyNinja> Use it wisely
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, you saw this movie. It's a one-world government. There IS only one country. And it runs contrary to values that were still held sacred when this movie was made.
<thelonepony> get RoidRage!
<thelonepony> yeaaaaah
<Petrified_Discord> yeaaaaaaaah
<Susan> :)
<DaringDerpy> the continent where the only way of social rise is a military career...how can one be too jingoistic for south america?
<brony_90> seems like iron will was a good trainer ... again...
<Nittany_Discord> Yep. Arena football.
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: Yep
<HoodyNinja> Ohai Nittany_Discord
<MadSurge> Hey Nittany_Discord! :$
<Hipster-Pony> HAI
<Kandarihu> Some of the values this movie runs contrary to are STILL held sacred even today.
<Obsidian> Hi Nittany_Discord
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: this is like fascism to the extreme
<Nyst> Lashes huh.
<Hipster-Pony> because normal discord was too mainstream
<Nittany_Discord> Professor Sam Fisher.
<Petrified_Discord> Hipster-Pony: MANEstream :P
<Nittany_Discord> Hi HoodyNinja, MadSurge, and Obsidian.
<HoodyNinja> Colorless by choice?
<alexxm|colt> wait this idiot is going to havard?
<Wirisme> lol
<Hipster-Pony> Petrified_Discord: LOL :D
<Ninjazz> Dat Sam Fisher.
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, agreed. And that's also the stereotype applied to the American people. That's why people here keep screaming MURIKKKAH!
<Nyst> It's a pretty interesting concept that such a violent and power driven civilisation could flourish. If you look at the buildings or tech things look pretty good.
<Obsidian> Who needs Harvard when you can go to war?
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: that's why I keep saying it too :D
<Buytoast> im gay!
<Hipster-Pony> I yell that to my friends
<Nyst> And -everyone- looks handsome.
<DaringDerpy> works for the usa too, Nyst. they're always at war, but never in their own soil
<DaringDerpy> on
<Klumzeedragon> Buytoast: We know. :)
<HoodyNinja> Nyst: Thats how most great countries flourished in the old days, like Rome, Greece, and all those other empires. They looked out for numero uno
<Snowflake> slut
<Buytoast> im gay just like nph
<Nyst> DaringDerpy: I like to imagine that the USA isn't quite at that level yet.
<Hipster-Pony> 6_9
<Klumzeedragon> Buytoast: just like or for?
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: probably the richest country's lifestyle is the one that takes on in a totalitarian one-nation world
<Snowflake> is there Boobs on here?
<Buytoast> we r never at war on usa soil cuz no one dares to fuck with us
<Hipster-Pony> HURHUR HAY GURL
<JT> there os snowflake
<Buytoast> we woop there ass
<MadSurge> Redhead
<Nyst> HoodyNinja: Well if you look at say the Spartans, they were culturally dead, instead having their slaves do all things art, music, technology and the like.
<Wirisme> some epic buffers last night
<Alchemist> MadSurge: yum
<Snowflake> is there a admin to repeat it over and over :D LOL
<DaringDerpy> Nyst: recruiting stupid school boys? being at constant war?
<HoodyNinja> I hate my computer...
<MadSurge> Snowflake: funny how you asked that :D
<Nyst> DaringDerpy: public lashings?
<Hipster-Pony> my name's Bonshaquitalafondria
<Kandarihu> Nyst, everyone thinks America has ALWAYS been at this level. We're NOT at that level, but everyone takes too much enjoyment shoving that stereotype down our throats.
<MakerDusk> Snowflake: an admin to repeat what over and over?
<DaringDerpy> Nyst: ok, this one is different
<Snowflake> LOL
<Svettponny> Oh lawd. I just went and got a cup of coffee, put two spoons of vanilla ice cream in it, and am now experiencing orgasmic feelings in my stomach.

<Vordox> BRAIN WASHING in actioj

<Cades> exactly haha
<Rex_Mundi> What movie is this?
<Kotano> Starship Troopers
<One> OCTAVIASSHOLE IN BACKGROUND!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey guys :)
<Yahooz> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: implying they can handle even PG-13
<DaringDerpy> infantry...
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Klumzeedragon> DaringDerpy: I don't think everyone here is old enough to see a human body. :D
<Hipster-Pony> hello
<Cades> are there any websites that can spell check stuff?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Yahooz True
<Kandarihu> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, let's face it. The reaction I'm seeing is NOT handling it.
<xxMoopyxx> hehehehehehehe
<Snowflake> man i i ever get to pick a movie it gonna be a porn o
<thelonepony> hi Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
<Cynder7> 6No idea..
<pony_300> people acting immature to an immature movie. Oh noes.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Snowflake: why must you test me...~
<Dark_Horst> shouldy you open the door BEFORE you fire the capule?

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> pretty good alexxm|colt just playin some Dark Souls
<Klumzeedragon> Cause Scoot-Scootaloo is MLG enough to handle anything. :)
<DaringDerpy> Fl00t4hSh41: because plot
<Fl00t4hSh41> Shouldn't that wait untill AFTER the pilots get their liscences?
<Kandarihu> Fl00t4hSh41, probably because the simulators don't give the full experience.
<Alchemist> I just realized they call those soldiers "mobile infantry". Is there an "immobile infantry"?
<Epicmetalfreak> Snowflake: Do what ever you want but dont make fluttershy cry :'(
<Hipster-Pony> One: WHAT?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Damnright, son~
<Nyst> Okay their spaceships look amazing. I love their design.
<Vordox> Whose Tombstone?
<Fl00t4hSh41> Kandarihu: But that wasn't supervised or as part of an exercise
<DaringDerpy> Alchemist: standard infantry has to walk to the front
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Scoot-Scootaloo here is your results in the MLG pro test: C
<Hipster-Pony> thelivingtomestone
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT, got any spare items for Tf2?

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Scoot-Scootaloo probably yes
<Vordox> HOw can a Tombstone live...?
<Hipster-Pony> One: ok
<Wrek> 05One: why would you punish him like that?
<Snowflake> well its not like iam cloping shes fine dont clop gosh
<Wrek> 05the chat will be unbearable
<Wrek> 05and he'll get a bad first impression
<Wrek> 05jeez
<One> Vordox: By the power of GODS.
<Percy_Vee> Agreed Wrek
<Wrek> 05if he want to join in sure he can join in
<Hipster-Pony> Vordox: he's a musician
<Wrek> 05but its the best if he uses a nickname or something
<brony_90> Vordox: look him up on youtube...
<Vordox> brony_90: Nah, his name is...
<Wrek> 05last he needs is the whole chat explodign cause hejoined
<Snowflake> who?
<Ninjazz> He will drown in the amount of pings he will get.
<Kandarihu> One, this isn't a good time for that. Not while we're watching Starship Troopers
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: I know right? Ponies goin crazy up in here today.
<Cades> i really want calamari tonight
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03If he actualy joined, I would know anyway~
<Alchemist> Wrek: this is no place for "celebrities" :D
<DaringDerpy> and then she wrecked earth's only orbital dock
<Snowflake> i love you and i dont know who he is
<Kandarihu> Okay. She's been through the simulations, and she aced them.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Klumzeedragon: somepony's been eating oatmeal huh? :S
<One> It was worth a bucking try, forum.
<Cynder7> 6Now you made me want it too.. >.<
<Wrek> 05i jsut personally think its for both the best of the chat and the celeb in question to use an alias
<Dark_Horst> nailed it
<ponyremix> holy shit that was close
<Snowflake> but a broney is all ways loved by snowflake
<JT> A woman can drive ^^
<Klumzeedragon> Alchemist: There was a SimGretina in here last night. :D

<Vordox> <--- I'm a better solider then those...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03This game.... is MLG

<DaringDerpy> in real battle, they wouldn't survive a week
<JT> TF2 XD
<McGoerk> in the third movie you'll see some mechs
<pony_300> what's mLG?
<brony_90> ded
<FlaschenJoe11> This tactic would never work, since No one is REALLY that good.
<ponyremix> YEA@
<One> Wrek: It would meeken the suspicion.
<Wrek> 05but i dotn trust this chat enough to safely say that join here as a celeb will prove a good experience
<JT> the third wasn't that good
<Klumzeedragon> pony_300: Minor League Gaming. :P
<Dark_Horst> the third was utter crap
<ponyremix> nope it wouldent One
<JT> those merauders wer meh
<Squallken> the third movie?
<Wrek> 05One: an alias is more than enough to dull any suspicion
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wrek is wise on his words
<Cynder7> 6I want more barbecue saus
<Cynder7> 6sauce! D:
<Wirisme> was AFK has it been the hand scene yet?
<JT> no dark_host the second was utter crap
<Ninjazz> And yet we have Mr. Poniator.
<Vordox> Wrek: Let him join and his fans praise him
<Kandarihu> What if he just goes as a pony_*?
<Alchemist> Klumzeedragon: well, I dont know that much brony celebrities. I know woodentoaster, alexs, tombstone, h8seed, aviators and that's about it
<Wrek> 05Vordox: by all means

<Wrek> 05i just dont want him to feel smothered
<Vordox> Wrek: Depends on WHAT fans... >.>
<Dark_Horst> JT: the seconds was plain boring the third was utter crap. especially since the bug animation got a downgrade to "hoby animator"
<One> Wrek: Skype says he's busy anyways.
<DaringDerpy> what could go wrong? celeb gets a bad impression?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Then again, there are floozy impersonatrs, which can get you banned!
<Snowflake> dont ask dont tell

<trollghost> Sumica: yea he wiped to fast, but that whipping was a pretty good speed
<Sumica> 00,10you are supposed to wait for the sting to die down before you do it again
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03sort of...
<DerpyMuffins> Wow my fanfic is doing better than I thought
<Sumica> 00,10othere wise they are still numb from the first few
<Kandarihu> Nyst, there is still discrimination. Mormons are discriminated against. And so are people who don't serve in the military.
<Snowflake> because the move is full of chat megs
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you seems to know a lot about this Sumica
<trollghost> wait.. i meant whipping cream
<JT> derpymuffins

<EleanorAwesome> DerpyMuffins: link
<Kandarihu> Scoot-Scootaloo, only because I kept quiet when by all rights, I shouldn't have.
<Dark_Horst> trollghost: lashings
<Nyst> Kandahiru: Yup. All discrimination distilled into citizen and civilian.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03yeah yeah~
<DerpyMuffins> Can I show fic links during stream?
<Sumica> 00,10we have an emote for that now Caramel

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03only image lnks DerpyMuffins~
<Snowflake> run!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Kandarihu> And even when I spoke up, I was shouted down by everyone who loved Boondocks.
<DocSane> Wait, is it an asteroid or a wormhole?
<DerpyMuffins> Guess not
<DerpyMuffins> Maybe later
<EleanorAwesome> D:
<otakon1> it's both
<Sumica> 00,10dont need to use it to type them =p
<MLP_Brovakiin> DerpyMuffins: Just PM the link
<Dark_Horst> why yes, we have this convenient button with exactly the right maneuver for precisely this one rock
<kidzrul434> Hey Bronies! The Newest Episode of PWAAMLP is on youtube right now!
<Fl00t4hSh41> Also gotta wonder why that rock is so slow
<Snowflake> wait till last sec retards
<trollghost> Dark_Horst: and even then it didnt work
<Hipster-Pony> :T
<Dark_Horst> wat? just push down the steering wheel? what are you, an amateur? we have buttons
<Nittany_Discord> Should have avoided sooner?
<trollghost> "so how many men did we lose?", "all of them sir"
<DocSane> Screw those guys on the...star destroyer bridge or whatever that was.
<otakon1> Kandarihu: you don't like Boondocks, we get it. You DO realize the humor of it is poking fun at racial stereotypes correct?
<Ninjazz> Probably should have.
<DaringDerpy> lost the canteen
<Ninjazz> But they were trying t o show off.
<Kandarihu> kidzrul434, what is that acronym?
<Dark_Horst> Nittany_Discord: and that is why you will never become a pilot
<trollghost> that engine just HAPPENED to be the communications centre too
<Cades> thats pretty cool
<trollghost> good job
<kidzrul434> Kandarihu Pheonix Wright Ace Attorney My Little Pony

<DocSane> God dman, I hate the Nazi athetic of this movie
<Snowflake> hi mommy!!!!!!!!!
<Wirisme> oh hai johnny
<Snowflake> hi daddy!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Kandarihu> otakon1, the stereotypes presented there about black people aren't very condemning in nature. The stereotypes presented about white people tend to be quite condemning.
<DocSane> We're the whitest people in Buenos Aeries
<otakon1> Kandarihu: so? you're point? it's funny
<otakon1> We love you
<otakon1> and then dead
<Snowflake> hail!
<DaringDerpy> DocSane: this has nothing to do with nazis...it's normal military culture
<Klumzeedragon> Hello mother, hello father!
<Bronysith> otakon1: what do you know, agro is alive
<Dark_Horst> DocSane: pssst, it'S part of the parodying take on propaganda this movie has, but dont tell anyone. it's a secret
<trollghost> wow, what a coincidence that just at the time he calls, rain kills them
<Kandarihu> DaringDerpy, it's not a military culture that happens every day.
<otakon1> Bronysith: yeah but YOU didn't know that
<Fl00t4hSh41> The sky is going dark because the sun is being blocked by A GIANT FIERY BALL
<otakon1> Bronysith: lol
<Wrek> 05of course they often are Kandarihu. its becasue its enoucraged and seen as accepted to be racist agaisnt white people
<Alchemist> oooooh, take THAT!
*otakon1 nick otakon
<DocSane> DaringDerpy: No, the costumes are intentionally designed to be reminicent of Nazi uniforms
<Ninjazz> Shouldn't they have seen a GIANT SPACE ROCK coming at them? Like they have people in the government for that, right?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Klumzeedragon: Here I am at, camp Granada
<otakon> tehre we go
<DaringDerpy> not in the book, DocSane
<SafariMonkey> otakon: Nice
<Wrek> 05DocSane: say what you want about the nazis, but their uniforms were fucking gorgeous
<Bronysith> otakon: oh there we go, thats much better
*Bronysith throws a rabid tonberry at otakon
<Snowflake> run
*otakon dodges
<Snowflake> run and you dont know why
<Bronysith> otakon: it is a homing tonberry
<DaringDerpy> free beer!
<Alchemist> WAR! Murika!
<Ninjazz> One of the few things Hitler made right, Wrek.
<DocSane> DaringDerpy: I know, but Verhoeven made the usual lazy mistake of assuming Starship Troopers is a Fascist story.
<Dark_Horst> why yes, they had awesoem uniforms. hugo boss designed them
*otakon leads the homing tonberry BACK to Bronysith
<Dovah> the hell is wrong with the nazis? they were just following orders.. :|
<Michael> ohai everypony :D
<Kandarihu> Wrek, but is it right? Regardless of what the tone in the media and blogs and academia say, is it right to be racist against white people?
<thelonepony> hi Michael
*Bronysith grabs otakon and attaches the tonberry to his back
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wrek done by hugo boss apparently
<Obsidian> oodly specific tragetory
<otakon> AH!
<DaringDerpy> good aim
*Michael hugs thelonepony
<Nyst> We know the bugs can aim and shoot asteroids.
<Pikachu> Hi Bronies/Ponies :) im feeling dizzy :P
<otakon> GETITOFF!GETITOFF!GETITOFF!
<Wrek> 05Kandarihu mhm
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Michael :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Pikachu
<otakon> foreshadowing!
*Michael hugs MLP_Brovakiin
<DaringDerpy> hit a city from the other end of the galaxy
<thelonepony> hi Pikachu
<SafariMonkey> Hey Pikachu
<Nyst> Though we don't know why.
<Michael> ohai Pikachu
<Cynder7> 6:3
*MLP_Brovakiin hugs Michael back :3
<alexxm|colt> how are things Pikachu
<otakon> DaringDerpy: 50K light years away....which means they launched it 50K years ago
<FlaschenJoe11> There are some rumors, that the Federation did that themselves to get the morale for the Klendathu Attack.
<pony_300> Nyst: I've been playing with the idea that he bugs traveling by asteriod is propaganda in order to engage the war. *conspiracy Keanu*
<Lil_B> OBJECTION!
<otakon> so I'm pretty sure it WASN'T INTENTIONAL
<Michael> lol
<Kandarihu> There was a time where it was popular to be racist against black people. Those times are over, although there are people who keep dredging up those terrible memories for personal gain. Holding white people of today responsible for the crimes of the distant past.
<Michael> this is starship troppers if i am not wrong
<Ninjazz> Dat bro sarge.
<Nyst> pony_300: maybe, but they can actually do that. it's how they colonize other planets.
<Fl00t4hSh41> otakon: It had to be launched a lot earlier than that, it wasn't relatavistic
<Dark_Horst> and that day boomer died
<Snowflake> no my dog
<MLP_Brovakiin> Doggy :'(
<DaringDerpy> otakon: everything is moving, even to hit earth they had to aim very precisely. it was intentional
<otakon> Fl00t4hSh41: well it wasn't traveling even at the speed of light
<Obsidian> NotBoomer!
<Cades> is there any boston pizzas in ur area?
<alexxm|colt> boomer died
<Pikachu> alexxm|colt: Good i feel dizzy from going on a fast ride 10 time
<Wirisme> boomer must live!
<Pikachu> s
<Kandarihu> Michael, troppers, lol
<Pikachu> s
<Snowflake> fauckers showed us a dead dog fuck them
<Fl00t4hSh41> otakon: That's what I said
<Squallken> again, why do they not just blow up the planet?
<DocSane> Why are they so afraid to make technology-using non-humanoid aliens?
<otakon> DaringDerpy: but it wasn't traveling at the speed of light for one.
<pony_300> Nyst: Yea, that's only what we've been told, but we haven't really seen them *do* it
<Pikachu> KYF
<Michael> thanks Kandarihu
<Ninjazz> Dat NPH.
<otakon> DocSane: bc then we can sympathize with them
<Pikachu> know your foe :)
<Snowflake> troll :D
<pony_300> and it doesn't seem like the bugs riding on that meteor that destroyed that town survived
<Cynder7> 6Boston pizzas?
<otakon> pony_300: no bugs on it
<Alchemist> dat propaganda
<DaringDerpy> ahahaha
<brony_90> just like dead space.... aim for something and kill it
<Michael> omg
<otakon> god so much propaganda
<Caramel> 2,14 otakon: in the book/tv show there were
<EleanorAwesome> hahaha
<Klumzeedragon> 90% Less Bugs!
<Nyst> pony_300: I think they did. The've seen bugs on other planets, plus they quarantained the planet's asteroid belt.
<otakon> Caramel: hmmm
<Cades> i guess not then
<Michael> this movie is getting interesting
<otakon> Nyst: those are spores ON the asteroids that hatch after planet fall
<Snowflake> YUM YUM SLUT
<Cades> maybe its only in canada
<brony_90> somehow i like this movie more than Bedman
<Colt_Silver> The only good bug is a DEAD BUG!
<pony_300> otakon: ahh
<DocSane> Genocide! Genocide!
<DocSane> Bonk bonk on the head!
<otakon> brony_90: Batman
<FlaschenJoe11> You know what would be funny, If the Bugs saw this tv channel
<otakon> yes
<otakon> yes it would
<Michael> kill all the bugs
<Colt_Silver> "Lets all get cut together" <---wtf?
<brony_90> otakon: ah know :3
<Dark_Horst> the slut dumped you,r emmember?
<pony_300> wait, how do you qurantine an asteriod belt?
<Colt_Silver> Michael: Kill ALL the bugs!
<Colt_Silver> pony_300: very carefully
<otakon> pony_300: no one is allowed to go near it to colonize the planets nearby
<Alchemist> is she really this dumb?
<Michael> wtf
<DaringDerpy> women
<JT> eeyup
<Snowflake> put bug spray around the rock done
<DaringDerpy> he is best for him too
<Hipster-Pony> whelp
<Hipster-Pony> BYE EVERYPONY
<pony_300> otakon: so the bugs aren't allowed near the asteriod?
<otakon> kick his ass
<Hipster-Pony> :T
<otakon> bye Hipster-Pony
<JT> who needs bug spray if we have nuke's on missle launchers
<Axel_Dash> byebye
<Michael> bye Hipster-Pony
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye Hipster-Pony
<Ninjazz> Here comes a fight.
<alexxm|colt> nye Hipster-pony
<Cameh_Dude> pye hipster-pony! :)
<JT> cya hipster
<otakon> pony_300: no not the bugs, humans.
<Squallken> owned :D
<Michael> all them pings
<otakon> kick your ass
<Ninjazz> Fight, fight, fight, fight.
<Michael> oh shit
<Squallken> 2 head shots :D
<Snowflake> bug spray= upgardes
<Kandarihu> Alchemist, welcome to the universe of Starship Troopers. Most of the time, if you have to ask "Is X really that stupid?", the answer is yes.
<pony_300> otakon: why would theyy be worried about humans going near the belt?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dat music
<otakon> yeah I'm sure THE PILOT would win in a fight against a infantryman.
<pony_7007> Such hapy music
<Axel_Dash> xDDDDD
<pony_7007> happy*
<Michael> ideal music for battle
<DocSane> We need to watch the awful Starship Troopers anime after this.
<Alchemist> if a flight officer can win a fight against an infantry soldier, there are some serious problems in training
<Snowflake> lasers coool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Hi everypony. Just got back frm practice...and feel ded.
<DaringDerpy> the infantryman has only basic training
<Fl00t4hSh41> otakon: Pilots do need a lot of physical training due to G forces they have to withstand
<otakon> pony_300: BC THE BUGS SPORES ARE IN THE BELT AND COULD CONTAMINATE any ships flying through, allowing the bugs to "piggyback" on the ship.
<Obsidian> Hello Kawaii_icybeauti
<Michael> ohai Kawaii_icybeauti
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Kawaii_icybeauti :)
<Axel_Dash> dat music
<Axel_Dash> :D
<JT> the problem with this is
<otakon> Fl00t4hSh41: that doesn't mean hand to hand combat though I wouldn't think beyond basic
<Kawaii_icybeauti> heya Obsidian Michael MLP_Brovakiin
<SafariMonkey> hello crazypony
<Ninjazz> dat theme.
<Colt_Silver> im pretty sure this is the scene that inspired the ODST in Halo
<FlaschenJoe11> I love this Music
<DocSane> All personnel, report for Operation Deadmeat!
<JT> They try to swarm the bugs...
<Ninjazz> So good.
<otakon> ah yeah THIS scene
<Dark_Horst> and this is the scene that alone makes this movie worth watching
<Snowflake> moves out wise more games where like that
<DerpyMuffins> These guys seem like stupid teenagers than soldiers
<otakon> DerpyMuffins: that's the point
<Alchemist> poor dogs
<Epicmetalfreak> they are
<thelonepony> Hell Jumpers away
<pony_300> otakon: ahh, finally it makes some sense
<DaringDerpy> DerpyMuffins: where is the difference?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I saw a list from some feminist site on "Most empowering girl's shows," and MLP was on it :$
<Kandarihu> DerpyMuffins, they're both teenagers and soldiers.
<Michael> do it for the dogs!
<Colt_Silver> thelonepony: Feet first into hell!
<FlaschenJoe11> First Wave? "WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!!"
<SafariMonkey> WE get you sir! haha
<Percy_Vee> That would be becuase they *are* stupid teenagers weho happen to be soldiers, too.
<Snowflake> weeeeeeeeeeeee
<otakon> Kawaii_icybeauti: but feminist site...
<Wirisme> mlp is a girls show?
<DocSane> No powered suits = no chance in hell
<Wirisme> ;)
<DaringDerpy> no halfway sane person would sell his body as meatshield for the government
<Nyst> That music. It reminds me of Robocop.
<Fl00t4hSh41> But Rico's a raw recruit straight out of bootcamp. Why do you think he has more than basic hand to hand training?
<Alchemist> FlaschenJoe11: You are first wave! Here is your mandatory red shirt!
<otakon> DocSane: no artillery or heavy vehicle support either
<Percy_Vee> Love the power suits. Missed them when I first saw the movie.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> otakon: Your right...But at least they can't say one thing isn't horrible..
<otakon> true
<otakon> also, idiots
<Nyst> DaringDerpy: the media paints it as a fun adventure.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> you're....UGGHHHH*
<Dark_Horst> hey guess what? the bugs are pooping at you. from the planets surface
<Michael> dabuck?
<Colt_Silver> Sumica: Its applejack appreciation day at EqD
<DocSane> otakon: Like I said, they removed the powered suits and didn't realize they needed to add the other stuff back in.
<otakon> GIANT BALLS OF HOT PLASMA
<Dark_Horst> that's soem fucking sphincter power right there
<Kandarihu> Alright. All these ships are clustered together. That's not a good tactic.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Lotto happen yet?
<Atheist> nobody makes it back alive
<Snowflake> did some one call for 25 pie boxes?
<Fl00t4hSh41> Also, why is the space fleet parked so densely they can almost spit from one ship to the next?
<otakon> REMEMBER YOUR TRAINING AGAINST HUMAN TACTICS AND INTELLIGENCE
<Nyst> A million years of buttpower evolution.
<DaringDerpy> Nyst: that's how they get their recruits. adventure. unusually much money for unskilled work helps too.
<otakon> that do NOT cover fighting gianting insectoids
<Colt_Silver> Kandarihu: Human tactic 101: "The Zerg Rush"
<Atheist> how come human starships always look like crap
<otakon> so much fail
<Axel_Dash> big goddamn mistake
<Dark_Horst> they didnt expect bugs to be able to hit stuff
<otakon> so MUCH goddamn fail
<Caramel> 2,14 now I wish I had starcraft II installed on this machine
<Atheist> FAILLLLL
<FlaschenJoe11> So, the bugs are dumb? WRONG!!
<Michael> fail spaceship!
<Colt_Silver> Atheist: cuz theyre funded by corporations with outside interests :P
<DocSane> How come the EarthFed ships are always, like, 20m apart?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Wait a sec, who in tarnation picked this?
<Caramel> 2,14 I'm in a real god damn bug killing mood right now
<Atheist> i gues that explains it
<otakon> Dark_Horst: and yet they said the bugs hit EARTH from 50K light years away
<MLP_Brovakiin> ded
<Nyst> DocSane; because the literally wanted to blanket the planet with bombs and troops.
<Snowflake> pizza is here!
<Colt_Silver> Caramel: then go play Skyrim and uninstall all the patches :P
<Fl00t4hSh41> DocSane: Yeah, they should be easily 100km from eachother
<Nittany_Discord> Quite a shot.
<JT> yeah swarm the bugs
<Alchemist> why not just vaporize the whole planet with nukes?
<Colt_Silver> Human zerg rush!!
*FlaschenJoe11 waves his Bugs Flag, for support of his favourite Race in this movie.
<pony_300> pewpewpew
<Major> This reminds me of Earth Defence Force :P
<Kawaii_icybeauti> It's thundering here...I'm just thinking that the pegasi missed a downpour last week.
<Ninjazz> FOR THE MOTHERLAND.
<Atheist> ZERG RUSH
<Alchemist> uraaah!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> FUS RO DAH!
<Nyst> Alchemist: not enough glory and sense of superiority.
<otakon> Kawaii_icybeauti: they're kicking up a wind storm over here
<Michael> lol
<DaringDerpy> human wave tactics
<Colt_Silver> Alchemist: ikr? Its yonkers all over again. Zeds dont give a hoot about infantry tactics, and neither do bugs
<JT> well the Bugs are cooler in this movie
<Michael> dat is a huge bug
<Fl00t4hSh41> Alchemist: They need a publicrelations stunt?
<DaringDerpy> 30% losses guaranteed
<Wrek> 05Caramel: id play you but region lock :o
<DocSane> Alchemist: Exactly. In the book, there were several races at war and they needed to capture and hold, not just destroy.
<Lil_B> Fürs Vaterl... Muttershiff!
<Axel_Dash> ZERG STUFF
<Caramel> 2,14 wrek: IKR?
<otakon> Colt_Silver: except WE are intelligent and THEY work on instinct
<Kandarihu> Maybe after this movie, I'll just get on PSO2. The overarching enemies are basically giant dark bugs collectively known as Darkers. But they are clearly evil.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Operation Human Sheild is a go~
<Kawaii_icybeauti> otakon: Well, the storm is passing through where I live, going east. Did it hit you guys yet?
<Atheist> alian butt lazers
<Michael> ^
<Wrek> 05otakon: not the rbain bugs
<DerpyMuffins> Dat buttlazer
*Bronysith grabs Scoot-Scootaloo
<Fl00t4hSh41> Alchemist: And infantry on the ground looks better in the propaganda than a spaceship nuking some random rock
<Nyst> alien butt plasma you mean.
<Wrek> 05the zerglings maybe
<Colt_Silver> otakon: What they lack in intelligence, they make up for with a hivemind and vast numbers
<otakon> Kawaii_icybeauti: it got REALLY windy heavily here
<Wrek> 05but not the brainbugs
<JT> Nuke's For the win ^^
<thelonepony> move up Space Marines!!!
<otakon> Colt_Silver: vast is an understatement
<Kotano> well,THERE's a design-flaw...
<Wrek> 05SPAEC MUHREENS
<JT> nah Imperial gaurd XD
<otakon> one bug
<Alchemist> Yeah, I always forget that this movie was a recruiting tool
<Atheist> why didnt they just use the DEATH STAR to destory the entir eplanet
<Michael> ded
<Axel_Dash> zerlings!
<otakon> takes 12 guys to kill
<Michael> om nom nom
<thelonepony> ded
<Colt_Silver> Atheist: troopers r cheaper
<otakon> AND 100's of rounds
<DaringDerpy> Kawaii_icybeauti: storms are cool. :)
<brony_90> They´re always using Rocket-Launchers...Why not Zoidberg
<Kawaii_icybeauti> otakon: I had to cheer a football game this morning, and it started puring like hell where it was taking place. Thank gawd we left early. But it was nice for most of the afternoon until I got home just now.
<Rain> antlion!
<Snowflake> zerg rush o shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<DocSane> No air support, no basic tactics...
<Ninjazz> Do bullets stop anything?
<Major> Jesus....
<Axel_Dash> they're DOOMED
<DaringDerpy> counterattack ^^
<otakon> FALL BACK YOU IDIOTS
<MLP_Brovakiin> You have to cut off the limbs!
<Kandarihu> otakon, I'd say both sides lack intelligence. They BOTH run on instinct.
<Michael> fail tactics
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Storms are cool, but I don't like the noises.
<Colt_Silver> docsane no tanks...just a zerg rush of infantry
<DaringDerpy> concentrated fire
<Atheist> troops may be cheaper but are a 100,000,000X less affective
<Dark_Horst> DocSane: they're first wave, they're cannon fodder and defenseline-stresstest
<Nyst> DocSane: they approached this comepletely confident they'd win instantly.
<otakon> and then THIS moron
<DaringDerpy> and hope they die
<brony_90> MLP_Brovakiin: its not dead spce
<Michael> noob down
<Axel_Dash> in the balls
<Nittany_Discord> Ow.
<Axel_Dash> XD
<Atheist> I HOPE EVERYONE DIES
<otakon> dead
<thelonepony> Pedro NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
<Fl00t4hSh41> Translation from arachnid <FOOD!>
<Squallken> idior
<otakon> and ofc the body armor does NOTHING
<Squallken> idiot*
<JT> the media guy in this battle scene is awesome XD
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03apparently grenades don't exist in this time period...
<Axel_Dash> pwned
<MLP_Brovakiin> brony_90: My point still stands :D
<Ninjazz> Dude just can't get a break.
<Major> O_O
<thelonepony> he's like Carbine from Gears of war!
<DaringDerpy> welcome to war
<nonody2> That was probably a COD fanboy anyways
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: oh they do
<DaringDerpy> this is only the beginning
<brony_90> MLP_Brovakiin: :D
<DerpyMuffins> ded
<DocSane> They have nukes and future M-16s. And that's it.
<otakon> dead
<Nittany_Discord> Gotta not love how violent this movie is.
<Colt_Silver> otakon: prolly cuz a bug bite has more punch than a bullet
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Needs more Ben Carmine
<pony_300> Scoot: I think only 3 exist in this world
<Kandarihu> Scoot-Scootaloo, they were firing grenades from RPG launchers... the thermonuclear grenades.
<Michael> come with papa
<Caramel> 2,14 Scoot: rofl
<Nyst> In the books they also had mechsuits.
<otakon> true
<thelonepony> she ded
<Klumzeedragon> Scoot-Scootaloo: Grenades are for MLG only. They arent MLG enough.
<Wrek> 05what would work here? a heavy caliber sabot shotgun
<Ninjazz> Scoot-Scootaloo, Clay Carmine is best Carmine.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Ih yeah that's right...
<Atheist> these people are diots
<Wrek> 05preferrably drum magazined
<otakon> how about some ARTILLERY COVER?
<brony_90> Everytime someone enters the rage-badass-mode je dies....
<Atheist> IDIOTS
<Dark_Horst> yeah, they reserved the heavy ordinance for the bug artillery
<Wrek> 05almsot liek an AA12
<Atheist> IDIOTS
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Anthony Carmine was MLG!
<Atheist> IDIOTS
<Alchemist> I really want to see this scenario in the Alien franchise
<Kawaii_icybeauti> We're watching pony after this, right?
<Michael> wut
<otakon> nom
<Colt_Silver> See what I wouldve done first is carpet bomb the place. Heck GLASS the entire planet like the covenant would
<Ninjazz> Anthony was OG.
<JT> The camera guy xD
<Sumica> 00,10would not mind some sc2 my self
<otakon> nom nom nom
<Major> Wrek: I would go with an M60
<Axel_Dash> oh man xD
<Michael> ded reporter is est reporter
<Atheist> everyone is an idiot

<Michael> *best
<otakon> hiya Joy
<Atheist> WHY DID WE SEND GROUND TROOPS
<Fl00t4hSh41> And now we are back to the scene from the intro
<thelonepony> hi Joy
<Atheist> were are the planes
<Wrek> 05Major: too little a punch for the ammo cost
<Michael> ohai Joy
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Joy came back to the chat! :D
<otakon> Atheist: military intelligence
<pony_300> I say lots of grenade launchers. Equip their entire front line with grenade launchers and they'd be fine
<Wrek> 05you're not fighting a human here
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: the morita actually has an integrated shotgun that fires the rifle ammo in bulk, the game usses that
*Ninjazz is now Joyful.
<Atheist> the sonar invisble jet fighters
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello again Joy :)
<thelonepony> drop the camera!!
<otakon> pony_300: flamethrowers too
<Joy> :)
<Axel_Dash> haha
<Atheist> why do we fail so much
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: this movie just seems to forget a lot of things
<Axel_Dash> dumb
<Joy> I feel so loved!
<Kandarihu> Infantry shoot with their guns. That camera guy is press, not infantry. He shoots with his camera.
<Snowflake> and stnd on a mountain
<thelonepony> ded
<otakon> hit with his dead buddy
<Caramel> 2,14 See, this is why you don't nuke Hiroshima, because if Japan were a stronger figure in this they'd be sending Gundams
<Michael> yummi human
<Major> Wrek: from what heard M60 rounds can tear a man in half
<Kawaii_icybeauti> man, dem effects....
<Cameh_Dude> colt_silver ikr?
<Axel_Dash> facehoof
<otakon> Caramel: they would HAVE giant robot mechs!
<Ninjazz> Dumbass.
<DaringDerpy> how about some grenade launchers?
<otakon> and STILL NOT DEAD
<Michael> lol
<Kotano> @caramel : yes,and Ninjas
<Sumica> 00,10AJ plushies! I want one'
<otakon> idiots
<Michael> dat gotta hurt
<Caramel> 2,14 Otakon: Just amazing Mazinger punching the shit out of these guys
<Atheist> therse no plains no mech infantry no tanks no planetry bombardment EVRYTHING IS MISSING
<Wrek> 05still a human
<JT> shot gun rounds ^^
<Nyst> The bugs are knows for staying lethal even with several limbs missing.
<Wrek> 05and you're not fightign a human here
<thelonepony> Last Stand!!
<DerpyMuffins> Reload once in a while will ya?
<Axel_Dash> how many shots do they take O_o
<Caramel> 2,14 In fact, I'm rewriting Z2, they aren't dimensional beasts, they're bugs
<Wrek> 05you are fightign a thick carapaced bug
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: ah, see? THERE is the built in shotgun
<Percy_Vee> Original book had power suits that could fly and had very heavy weapons compared to these. :P
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03shotguns are for n00bs -_-
<Fl00t4hSh41> Why are you so violent Rico, it was only trying to hug you
<DocSane> The powered suits in Starship Troopers aren't "giant". They're only 8ft tall.
<Wrek> 05with instict to eat your guts
<otakon> Wrek: eeyup and brb
<Colt_Silver> Nyst: according to neil patrick harris. Neil patrick harris has never led us wrong
<Kandarihu> Caramel, the Gundam was produced by the Earth Federation, another global government that isn't quite as evil as this government... but is stil pretty bad.
<Wrek> 05Scoot-Scootaloo: shotgusn are SOOO MLG man
<Atheist> oh really
<Alchemist> most retarded army ever
<Atheist> yep
<Michael> ^
<Fl00t4hSh41> Poor arachnids
<brony_90> ded
<Nyst> They're more like exosuits then mechsuits.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Wrek: Awww HELLL naw!
<Kotano> "I'm sorry,we made a whoopsie."
<Sumica> 00,10shotguns can fire more then just buckshot
<Fl00t4hSh41> They where only trying to greet their new neighbors with hugs
<Wrek> 05Sumica: grenades!
<pony_300> I hate this part. Somehow the bugs having brains is impossible?
<Wrek> 05love shotgun grenades
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03except Spas-12's, they are totally for pros~
<Major> Wrek: Frag Rounds? :P
<Wrek> 05that guy needsa bat to the head
<Wirisme> lol this guy
<Snowflake> no brains
<Axel_Dash> xDX
<Percy_Vee> And thus, not possible. :P
<Atheist> that dude is an idiot
<Sumica> 00,10I just so happen to have one too scoot
<Fl00t4hSh41> Sure, they where trying to hug the humans with their jaws, but they ARE insects...
<DocSane> And thus we see the mindset of modern conservatives.
<Ninjazz> Spas-12's were the only /actual/ shotgun.
<Snowflake> just sex
<Klumzeedragon> Scoot-Scootaloo: Especially in MW2! :P
<Nyst> limping back.
<Colt_Silver> Ya..the only thing that put the bug down were those shotgun slugs
<Sumica> 00,10for home defence
<Dark_Horst> the thing is, the rifles the mobile infantry here uses is compeltely sufficient for bugs. armor piercing, high capacaty magazine and built in shotgun. these kids are just too dumb to use it right
<Michael> the fail in that intercourse was just epic
<Cameh_Dude> Nyst yep :D
<Joy> What is this?
<Ninjazz> Arn't they illegal?
<Alchemist> she survived an inferno with just a cut?
<Ninjazz> In the US?
<Obsidian> Alchemist: Plot Armor
<Nyst> She needs that one cut to look badass.
<Nittany_Discord> Funny how some of those ships got there w/o engines.

<Eli> how can the spaceships lie on top of each other? there's no gravity
<RaveBrony> ded
<Michael> he ded!
<pony_300> Dark_Horst: Yea but if you don't hit them in the right spot, they can still be a strong threat. In any case for the huge numbers they face, they need something with higher destructive capacity IMO
<SafariMonkey> Hello Phase4
<DaringDerpy> they left them all behind
<Caramel> 2,14 "Oh no, the boyfriend who's heart I broke on the eve of battle died"
<Wrek> 05meh

<Wrek> 05wold*
<pony_300> Dark_Horst: I don't think it's dumb so much as the situation. Don't have time to aim for brain stems or whatever on things that are as active and mobile as those things and attack enmasse
<Wrek> 05world*
<Sonny> haha wrek :p didn't know that
<DocSane> They had to shut down your immune system to make it work, so the patients would form cancer tumors that each had to be treated as the limb was being regrown.
<Colt_Silver> Atheist: shields r science fiction obviously. :P
<Sonny> I'll consider all your advise tough Wrek
<Fl00t4hSh41> Atheist: Shields don't exist in this Sci fi universe
<pony_300> it's like asking for a bullseye shot on all 100 of the rushing bugs coming at you
<Sonny> right back to work
<Dark_Horst> pony_300: let'S call it inexperienced then
<Colt_Silver> PAWNCHED

<DaringDerpy> he has no girlfriend
<Dovah> I almost thought they were both guys for a second there
<Caramel> 2,14 Kandarihu: she broke up with him the night of the battle
<Colt_Silver> Eli: now i have to watch game of thrones dont i?
<Percy_Vee> Married to pair like that. trust me, plenty there.

<McGoerk> and his ex thinks he's dead

<Axel_Dash> Eli: hahaha I don't think so :P
<Fl00t4hSh41> Dark_Horst: I just wonder why some supply officer thought a company of soldiers would need a violin with their R&R supplies

<Snowflake> fuck no i need a hr
<Herostar> ummm hai nudityscene soon as i log in

<Fl00t4hSh41> alexxm|colt: Yup, that book was the trope namer for power armor and space marines
<Colt_Silver> DaringDerpy: FUCK YA War can wait!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Sarge is like "...nice."

<Michael> Wb Herostar
<thelonepony> hi Herostar
<otakon> DESERT PLANET, NO VEGETATION, NO OTHER LIFE BESIDES THE BUGS
<MLP_Brovakiin> ello Herostar
<Eli> well, if he isn't planing to get the girl off in any way, i guess 20's enough
<DerpyMuffins> This doesnt look like an ambush at all
<DaringDerpy> perfect ambush area
<JT> what do bugs even eat?
<Herostar> love the welcoming committee -w-
<brony_90> is the movie going to end soon?
<Cameh_Dude> incoming!
<Dark_Horst> this scene is my favourite mission in the game
<Wrek> 05JT: rocks
<Herostar> nomnomnom
<Wrek> 05pop rocsk to be exact
<thelonepony> see something moving, don't tell your platoon
<Kotano> maybe the bugs eat rocks.Plenty of those there...
<otakon> JT: anything but the point is there is NOTHING to eat on their planets
<Fl00t4hSh41> It just wanted to give him a hug
<Dark_Horst> you sit in the outpost and get to shoot lots of shit
<JT> Yeah
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sc0p3zzz
<Eli> how can you not notice a 7 meter buzzing bug?
<Michael> sniper is for noobs
<DaringDerpy> no one even fires
<otakon> Maybe the bugs are a silicone based lifeformt that can metabolize minerals?
<Fl00t4hSh41> And he shoots his own dude instead of the bug
<nonody2> dat teamkiller
<SafariMonkey> otakon: Are the bugs autotrophic? What do they eat?
<Eli> and now you know what the bugs eat
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Friendly fire :|
<Ninjazz> Needs more quick scope.
<JT> well otakon maybe its just they know that those humans come xD
<thelonepony> mercy
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03also dat hard scope
<otakon> SafariMonkey: no idea, but it's shown that they eat anything(cow, humans).
<DerpyMuffins> dam
<FlaschenJoe11> As I said: Rico, The Master of Field Promotion.
<DerpyMuffins> Best leader ever
<MLP_Brovakiin> otakon: They live off of the flesh of their enemies
<Kandarihu> Scoot-Scootaloo, I think that was meant as a mercy kill.
<Klumzeedragon> Scoot-Scootaloo: Only noobs quick scope.
<otakon> MLP_Brovakiin: the humans ONLY just got there
<Klumzeedragon> :P
<Fl00t4hSh41> otakon: They aren't silicium based if they can walk in the same atmosphere a carbon based lifeform can
<Axel_Dash> Kandarihu: Eeyup
<JT> Whiskey outpost ^^ best battle scene ever
<SafariMonkey> otakon: Yeah, but any biosphere needs autotrophs.
<otakon> Fl00t4hSh41: they could be it's science fiction
<Dark_Horst> also best mission
<Atheist> if everyone dies does that make rico fleet master of the enitre federation?
<MLP_Brovakiin> otakon: They have many enemies
<Herostar> a bug just killed everyone here... lets move in!
<Major> Some damn fort this is :/
<otakon> SafariMonkey: what's an autotroph?
<Michael> all the corpses
<JT> Eeyup
<otakon> all corpses
<Wrek> 05aye Klumzeedragon: real snipers steady tehir aim, pickign out the best target and aims for the head. do this logn enough adn you become fast enough to beat any quickscoper that gets a lucky shot
<otakon> NONE eaten
<FlaschenJoe11> JT: You know the HL2 Mod based on this battle? With the real Theme?
<isaac702> What is the point of the enclosed base. The bugs can fly.
<McGoerk> do you know what rank he has in the third movie xD
<JT> HL2?
<Fl00t4hSh41> otakon: No they can't, silicium can't make the right chemical compounds to be used to make life at room temperature
<otakon> isaac702: not many flyers
<FlaschenJoe11> JT: Half Life 2
<Atheist> hl2 is awesome
<Eli> seeing as this whole planet is a complete wasteland, i guess the bugs eat anything. it's actually a realistic picture of our future. the bugs are a lot like us i suuppose
<otakon> Fl00t4hSh41: true I guess
<JT> I don't play half life so nope
<Ninjazz> Actually, quickscoping ain't that hard. Just takes practice.
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Exactly. I like the way you think sir.
*Bronysith puts a muffin on otakon s ravaged face
<Atheist> throw a nuke down that hole
<SafariMonkey> otakon: A primary producer: something that gets its own energy from non-organic sources
<Herostar> a bug
<Herostar> it's not dead O-O
<Michael> ewwwww
<JT> they sucked his brain out!
<otakon> well apparently their metabolizm is robust enough to eat mineral for substanance
<JT> xD
<AdamTheDuck> Zombie bugs :|
<Fl00t4hSh41> otakon: It would have to be hot enough for liquid Silicium or cold enough to liquid amonia to dislove the silicium in
<otakon> odd thing is
<Axel_Dash> ewww
<Michael> bugs nomz brains!
<JT> best line ever
<Dark_Horst> brain slushy yum
<otakon> the wound is OUTWARD facing
<MLP_Brovakiin> zombie bugs
<otakon> NOT inward facing like a puncture SHOULD be
<DerpyMuffins> They eat brains now?
<Fl00t4hSh41> Thats either -100 degrees celcium or several hundred degrees above boiling
<Dark_Horst> on... deck? you relize you LEFT the spaceship, right?
<JT> Well brain bugs do :P
<Nyst> otakon: maybe the bugtentacle had barbs on it.
<Scootsy_Pie> What movie is this?
<SafariMonkey> otakon: yes, but not energy. They'd need a lot of mineral to get all that energy they're using.
<Dark_Horst> Scootsy_Pie: starship troopers
<Michael> Starship Troppers Scootsy_Pie
<Scootsy_Pie> Thank you~
<Herostar> crazy man bursts out and says you're gonna be heroes. my reaction= :D yey /)^3^(\
<SafariMonkey> otakon: ^Hc for most minerals is very low
<Caramel> 2,14 your faces when you realize those mormon colonists probably fed them the location of earth
<Michael> stfu
<Herostar> ...whacks the man...
<Cameh_Dude> lol
<Major> WERE ALL GONNA DIE!!!! ;~;
<otakon> SafariMonkey: they are the ONLY lifeform on the planet and it shows that they dig MANY MANY MANY miles under the planet in hives.

<DaringDerpy> party on!
<Ninjazz> YOU WANNA LIVE FOREVER?!
<Fl00t4hSh41> Where did they put all that airsupport and those nuclear RPGS?
<Herostar> oh... shit....
<Axel_Dash> wow
<Michael> all the horde
<Nyst> I want to live forever :(
<Atheist> I WILL LIVE FOREVER
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03brony_90: When we see bugs nuke the universe
<nonody2> MVM
<DerpyMuffins> Best LT. ever
<Kotano> I would like to,yes.
<Dark_Horst> KEKEKEKEKEKEKEKE
<Klumzeedragon> Nooooo. What gave them away? The grenade in the grub hole?
<Wrek> 05oh look sumica
<Kandarihu> Caramel, why would Mormons do that?
<Herostar> BUUUUUUUUUGS :O
<thelonepony> Get Rambo in here NOW!!!!!!
<Fl00t4hSh41> either would have been awfully useful here
<Wrek> 05the zerg player massed swarm hosts
<Herostar> ZERG RUSH
<otakon> Kandarihu: bc Mormons are weird
<DerpyMuffins> Its a trap....
<Caramel> 2,14 Kandarihu: brain bug
<Shamroc> Wrek: SO MANY LOCUSTS
<Atheist> dont these people know that helions counter zerG???????\
<Michael> yatatatatatatatata
<JT> Derpymuffins: Admiral Ackbar ^^
<DerpyMuffins> What no nukes?
<Eli> it's strange, i think i'm more scared of an everyday but than i would be of a 6 meter one... i think they would just disgust me in that size
<SafariMonkey> otakon: They'd use more energy eating than they'd get. There just isn't that much enrgy available via chemical processes, so unless they're nuclear...
<Caramel> 2,14 needs more ORAORAORAORAORA
<Sumica> 00,10such a noob terren, he for got to tech for mech
<Kandarihu> otakon, that's some bad reasoning there.
<Eli> bug*
<Obsidian> Wrek: Swarm hosts are OP
<Fl00t4hSh41> Derpy_Hooves: and no airsupport either
<Michael> noobs cant throw grenades
<Derpy_Hooves> what?
<Sumica> 00,10he dont even have hellions
<Atheist> i think these bugs are plants
<Caramel> 2,14 Sumica: look at this newb, 3 missile turrets and only 1 bunker
<DerpyMuffins> God reload atleast
<Wrek> 05MUTALISKS!
<SafariMonkey> Need more Dakka
<otakon> SafariMonkey: remember they DO have bugs that can crap out PLASMA BALLS
<Wrek> 05HOW THE FUCK DID HE TECK SPIRE ALREADY
<mentallyeffedguy> im watchiing THE MATRIX :D
<nonody2> Decapitation
<otakon> SafariMonkey: so maybe they ARE nuclear
<JT> Ofcourse not fl00t who do you thinkt they are? important people ?XD
<Wrek> 05TECH*
<Caramel> 2,14 HAX
<thelonepony> decapitation!
<Herostar> whack
<Fl00t4hSh41> Atheist: If they where plants, they wouldn't have enough energy to move
<Axel_Dash> hahaha
<thelonepony> ded
<Axel_Dash> pwned
<Ninjazz> Wow.
<Eli> they have a freaking great aim these bugs...
<Sumica> 00,10he would probably set his seage's in front of the bunkers too Caramel
<Ninjazz> He should have moved.
<Herostar> Welp, the general got boned
<DerpyMuffins> Premotion
<Atheist> IF they wernt plants then they couldnt exist theres nothing to eat
<Caramel> 2,14 Sumica: >implying he wouldn't try to use SCVs as tanks
<Michael> derp bugs
<Herostar> planet PENIS! CLEAR!
<Klumzeedragon> PLanet penis? Whut?
<mentallyeffedguy> hey Wrek do you have TV 3 SWEDEN?
<Fl00t4hSh41> Atheist: They may have some other food supply?
<Sumica> 00,10hey SCV's are usefull in heart of the swarm
<Snowflake> bug ramp
<otakon> WHERE ARE THE MORTARS?
<otakon> WHERE ARE THE GRENADES?
<Atheist> the only answer is is that these bugs are an advanced form of plant life that somehow gains enough solar enrgy to survive and move around
<Herostar> i luv blasting bugs :3
<Michael> well shit
<mentallyeffedguy> ive seen this movie before actually
<Sumica> 00,10make hellions in to battle mechs with them Caramel
<SafariMonkey> otakon: plasma is just superheated, it can't cause nuclear effects (nuclear is unaffected by temperature) but maybe the plasma is nuclear in origin...
<DerpyMuffins> Im half expecting teh LT. to punch a bug in the face
<Fl00t4hSh41> Atheist: They could be growing mushrooms or fungy bellow the ground
<Axel_Dash> dat swarm
<Eli> they could do Legolas and Gimlis game here
<Herostar> shit another zerg rush -_-
<otakon> SafariMonkey: well that's what I meant
<Michael> yes run, let them catch you
<Sumica> 00,10nice catch
<Herostar> impalement
<otakon> and also mobile plants isn't completely out of the question either
<MLP_Brovakiin> Eli: Haha
<Snowflake> got ya
<SafariMonkey> otakon: Thought so. You might be right
<Major> Sumica: more like nice stab :P
<JT> First and last time they need to reload in the starship trooper series.....
<Fl00t4hSh41> Aww, the bugs just wants to give them a big hug
<Sumica> 00,10where was gondor
<mentallyeffedguy> why are they on that planet anyways? :P
<Caramel> 2,14 >mfw as the bugs start climbing the walls, the people living below me play their music so loud the ground shakes
<Michael> dat giant scope
<SafariMonkey> *The bugs are nuclear!*
<Atheist> if there was fungal or plant life below then a visble ocean would definantly be noticeably on the surface and the planet would be greener
<Eli> MLP_Brovakiin: 21. 22. 23. that one still just counts as one!
<otakon> Caramel: lol
<Ninjazz> Caramel, dat ambience.
<DerpyMuffins> Finally
<DaringDerpy> proper mobile infantry should have vehicles and drones
<Michael> weee
<Herostar> backup!!!
<otakon> Atheist: no ocean, it's literally a desert planet
<Dken2021> hallo you wonderful peolpe!
<Kandarihu> Wow, Caramel.
<Snowflake> make them count lolz
<Obsidian> Hello Dken2021
<JT> Hi Dken
<Atheist> yes which is why the bugs must be Plants
<Ninjazz> Hey, Dken2021.
<Michael> ohai Dken2021
<DaringDerpy> hi Dken2021
<Sumica> 00,10yeah for being moble infintry they sure are dependant on navy
<Axel_Dash> yo Dken2021
<MLP_Brovakiin> Eli: A dwarf with an axe would fuck shit up in this situation :D
<thelonepony> Carmbine NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
<Fl00t4hSh41> Atheist: The bugs could have brought the spores for the fungi with them
<Michael> the hell?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hey Dken2021
<otakon> yeah shooting into the ground does NOT work
<Ninjazz> That's because they don't have heavy support.
<Herostar> EWW
<SafariMonkey> Atheist: Either they're photoautotrophs or have nuclear reactors in them
<otakon> Fl00t4hSh41: the spores are their eggs
<Eli> Gimli would rip them all apart!
<Axel_Dash> ewwwwww
<Herostar> 2 AN A HALF MEN :3
<mentallyeffedguy> its funny cause it just is
<Klumzeedragon> I thought he didnt have legs already?
<thelonepony> his legs!!!
<Michael> do it!
<otakon> SafariMonkey: well plasma "bugs" so second?
<DerpyMuffins> He can get new legs
<Sumica> 00,10FFS at least shoot him in the head
<Dken2021> just got back from first day working, I swear my manager looks like John De Lancie
<DaringDerpy> just a scratch
<Axel_Dash> Herostar: hahaha
<mentallyeffedguy> Herostar: nice one!

<Atheist> they are definatly Plant life
<nonody2> Mabye she can respawn
<Dken2021> so... starship troopers eh?
<Aryd> how about instead of standing there and calling her name, you shoot the bug
<Eli> her lung is pierced... how can she still scream
<howdyx> hello everypony
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello FillyFlam

<Sumica> 00,10yeah they do wrek
<Squallken> Zerg > Bugs
<Michael> toasty bug :D
<Caramel> 2,14 Sumica: Airforce- he's a dick
<MLP_Brovakiin> He is spraying hot cheese everywhere!
<otakon> GET ME A MEDI-GEL
<Fl00t4hSh41> Herostar: That bug just had a lot of chili for breakfast
<otakon> GET ME A GODDAMN MEDI-GEL!
<Kandarihu> Yeah. At this time last night, I was already back with dinner.
<FlaschenJoe11> Does anyone know, what happened to Carmen between the first and the third Movie?
<Atheist> gets this girl some bacta
<Dken2021> so has there been more "accidental" buffers?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Wait, what happened to Barney?
<SafariMonkey> Atheist: I agree, I just can't see them living underground if the're photoautotrophs
<Snowflake> slut with her dreams man
<Squallken> yay
<otakon> Dken2021: enope
<DerpyMuffins> They could have given the LT. new legs
<Eli> NOooo... she was pregnant!
<Herostar> noooooooooooooo
<Michael> ded
<Klumzeedragon> Scoot-Scootaloo: Ded/
<Sumica> 00,10would have realy sucked if she coughed up blood all over his face
<EleanorAwesome> robot legs
<DrSteveSCARz> bacta tanks (uncheck)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03NOO :'(
<otakon> and then she voided her bowel
<Obsidian> Awkward
<Ninjazz> Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. The wingman died?
<Klumzeedragon> Scoot-Scootaloo: Wait, Barney was metal hand right?
<otakon> Ninjazz: no the chick did
<Sumica> 00,10soooooo, they are like the best damn bridge crew fleet has.
<Ninjazz> Oh. Damn. :/
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03He's neil patrick harris :P
<Sumica> 00,10why are they doing combat drop sorties?
<Michael> he got promoted again
<otakon> what other plans?
<Michael> lol
<Obsidian> Scoot-Scootaloo: oh him? He's still on earth
<Caramel> 2,14 Sumica: I was thinking the same thing
<DerpyMuffins> I think he is LT. now
<Fl00t4hSh41> Sumica: Why else you they be flying a shuttle into a warzone?
<otakon> ITS JUST A GODDAMN DESERT
<Wrek> 05as they said
<Sumica> 00,10operation stupid fleet formation 2 is a go
<Wrek> 05they needed a crasy good pilate to land and pickem up
<Klumzeedragon> Scoot-Scootaloo: Oh. :P I don't know. I dont think they've shown him for the last hour.
<Snowflake> lol
<Atheist> well just because they live undergorund doesnt mean they spend all their time under the ground
<Major> otakon: maybe theres more to it? :P
<Caramel> 2,14 it just shows how much they think of the MI: "Send in the best for trivial work? Sure thing"
<Ninjazz> Hey, guys, look! A body we can actually bury for once!
<pony_300> so she died about 15 minutes after. estimate was wrong rfrom last night
<Klumzeedragon> Pilot lady doesnt have a scar over her eye anymore?
*Michael salutes
<Fl00t4hSh41> Ninjazz: One has to be the first
<Kandarihu> Ninjazz, and then they shoot it into space.
*Michael plays trumpet
<MLP_Brovakiin> launched into space
<Herostar> was gored to all hell. no bloodstains in coffin. seems legit
<Caramel> 2,14 Klumzeedragon: and Rico doesn't have a giant hole in his leg. Advanced medicine
<thelonepony> SPAAACCCE
<DrSteveSCARz> BUCKIN LAAG!
<Michael> spaaaaaceeee
<Snowflake> the dude does not have hole leg to owwww
<Ninjazz> Kandarihu, they need space for the living people. >.>
<Atheist> besides it couldnt be anything else amyway, there is no other life on the desert planet they couldnt get energy any other way other than being canibals which i dought highly due to the ature of life to be programmed to preserve it
<Wrek> 05a thosuand years later it will burn up at reentry
<Obsidian> Neil!
<DaringDerpy> cool uniforms
<Atheist> so they must be plants
<pony_5824> 00,02Fightclub!
<Ninjazz> Fl00t4hSh41, I'm suprised they only got one now.
<Major> Nazi?
<Klumzeedragon> Caramel: True. But why waste super medicine on a little eye scar? :D
<Rain> is that NPH!?
<Fl00t4hSh41> Dat gestapo trenchcoat
<Obsidian> Scoot-Scootaloo: See, he's alive
<MLP_Brovakiin> I would laugh if the coffin became a meteor and wiped out a city :D
<Caramel> 2,14 Klumzeedragon: BECAUSE SHE GOTTA LOOK PRETTY
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03yaay!
<Atheist> who names a planet P?????
<FillyFlam> Wow. Guess who's evil.
<Atheist> lame
<Dark_Horst> FINALLY he figured it out
<Wrek> 05MI: population control. not for the bugs, but for the uman speices
<SafariMonkey> Atheist: I guess maybe they're really efficient, or they have solar farms
<thelonepony> Human*
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03that actually seems legit!
<DerpyMuffins> He gets new promotions every other week now
<Klumzeedragon> Caramel: Dudes dig scars though. :P
<Fl00t4hSh41> Dark_Horst: You'd think that stasi uniform would have been a deadgiveaway
<Prince_Blueblood> lol, nickname of 'Atheist'
<Kandarihu> Atheist, since this movie was made, NASA discovered a real Earthlike planet that's about 20 light years away or something. They literally named it Planet C.
<Prince_Blueblood> bound to invite trouble
<Snowflake> ther helmets are stiofoam
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek is shwasted. Stop correcting his spelling. :D
<otakon> Klumzeedragon: if only Meanwhile was here
<Eli> Klumzeedragon: that's more of an opinion, right?
<Atheist> thats stupid nameing a planet by a letter is really really lame
<Dark_Horst> Fl00t4hSh41: 1) i was talking about rico^^ 2) that'S a waffen-ss uniform
<otakon> there is a KID in the front line
<DaringDerpy> 12yo
<Sumica> 00,10what if his name was bob?
<otakon> SERIOUSLY
<otakon> KID
<Snowflake> omfg like 14 year olds
<DerpyMuffins> Thats a kid
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03AMERICA!
<Atheist> i is have BROWNIES
<Klumzeedragon> otakon: Why's that? :D
<Michael> so much america
<Sumica> 00,10more like earth Scoot-Scootaloo
<Klumzeedragon> Eli: I suppose it is. :P
<Major> What was the name of this again?
<Atheist> EVASIVE MANUVERS
<Ninjazz> Hey. He has the right to fight as much as anyone else.
<otakon> Klumzeedragon: bc he's British and he LOVE being a spelling/grammar nazi.
<Wrek> 05same mistake twice
<Wrek> 05with the formation
<DaringDerpy> again the humans fall for the same tricl
<Dark_Horst> aaaaand closed fromation again. becasue that was SUCH a good idea the first time
<Fl00t4hSh41> Dark_Horst: It's still a blatantly evil looking trenchcoat
<SafariMonkey> Atheist: Remember they can only capture the energy from light that hits them. That's 1kw/m^2 on earth, not a lot for something like that
<Rain> FOR EARF!
<otakon> Wrek: I know
<JT> Starship troopers
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03In the future, Earth is renamed: Amearth
<Klumzeedragon> Major: Starship Troopers.
<DrSteveSCARz> Holy crap if my stream cant play the movie for more than 5 seconds i out
<Ninjazz> 'MEARTH.
<Eli> why are they attacking the planet in the first place
<Fl00t4hSh41> Why don't they park their fleet further away from the planets?
<Eli> ?
<Kandarihu> And THiS is why you don't cluster ships together if the enemy has Surface to Orbit bombardment capabilities.
<Snowflake> fire in space@@@@@
<DaringDerpy> humans are idiots. they deserve to die
<Fl00t4hSh41> Like outside the range of those plasma bugs
<Dusty> who was here for the buffering problems last night?
<Dark_Horst> Fl00t4hSh41: dropship range
<Wrek> 05eli: to fidn a bainbug, you not payign attention?
<Michael> wow dat was a direct hit
<Wrek> 05its sooooo obvious
<Sumica> 00,10would have been funny if the rear half went to warp
<Major> Well shit.........
<Rain> Snowflake, they have oxygen on that ship
<Eli> DaringDerpy: very sad, but just as much true
<twilight_sprinkle> Dusty: me
<thelonepony> death, death everwhere
<DaringDerpy> I for one welcome our new bug overlords!
<Herostar> Humans: YEY we're going to escape! :D bug: NOPE.AVI
<Michael> abandon ship!
<Snowflake> on the oputside and that air still would not be that much to make a big fire
<Atheist> maybe the bugs skin is made of a chemical that has an 83% effeciency at caputuring light energy, making it more effecient than all photosynthesizing lifeorms
<DaringDerpy> eyeyey
<Dusty> that sucks
<Fl00t4hSh41> Why do the spaceships "sink" when hit?
<Sumica> 00,10there were no buffering problems last night, it was buffering awsome
<Major> JESUS
<Eli> Wrek: ... not so much
<Snowflake> ahhh
<Michael> abandon ship!
<killerpony7733> Fl00t4hSh41 gravity?
<thelonepony> she ded
<Obsidian> Fl00t4hSh41: Gravity of the planet
<DrSteveSCARz> Fl00t4hSh41: Gravity of nearby planets
<Wrek> 05eli: jstu keep in midn peopel might not be so keen on explainign when you've been given the answer and ignored it
<pony_7007> Sumica: made the movie beter
<Franek12354> this is wreck not a ship
<FlaschenJoe11> Fl00t4hSh41: They are in Low Orbit.
<Fourbox> scotty could fix it
<robotdragon9> lol i just read starship troopers
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: true, the buffer was on fire!
<Fl00t4hSh41> But they are in a stable orbit, no?
<robotdragon9> and watched it
<DaringDerpy> gravity fields are shaky
<Petrified_Discord> Explode ALL the things
<Kandarihu> We really enjoyed the buffering last night.
<Sumica> 00,10yes is was as if the buffer was being controlled
<Percy_Vee> Not after impact... throws off speed and trajectory
<Eli> Fl00t4hSh41: ... space physics? they should float backwards actually
<DrSteveSCARz> Fl00t4hSh41: they had engines to keep them at an orbit
<Snowflake> flips like a boss on ship going down
<Herostar> SUPAHNOVA
<Fl00t4hSh41> Or are they wasting massive amounts of energy on making themselves easier targets by holding still?
<Caramel> 2,14 Sumica: LIES! WE WOULD NEVER FORCEFULLY BUFFER OUR STREAMS <.< >.>
<Atheist> maybe the bugs have a thinner atmospher on there planet letteing in more light energy and have more efficent means of light to energy conversion
<otakon> >Ship that houses hundreds
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: yeahhhh...^_-
<Snowflake> 2 man esacpe pods not that good
<otakon> >Escape Pods only fit TWO people
<SafariMonkey> Atheist: so that's up to 2 kw per bug, when it's on the surface.
<Kandarihu> Kind of like the Hurricane Fluttershy premier
<Percy_Vee> Bridge escape pod.
<otakon> idiots
<SafariMonkey> Atheist: ok, 3kw
<otakon> this movie has SO MUCH IDIOCY
<Michael> otakon: logic not found
<Eli> Caramel: really? because sometimes, you just hit THE perfect second for buffer
<Dark_Horst> isnt that the escape pod from screamers?
<otakon> Caramel: shenanigans
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: Like our Batman buffer earlier? :D
<otakon> Dark_Horst: and then re-used assets too
<robotdragon9> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIGHCoVzqtk have a soundtrack
<Ninjazz> I'm not sure flying a life shuttle to the planet full of bugs is a good idea.
<Michael> no vid links
<twilight_sprinkle> inb4 no vid links herpderp
<DerpyMuffins> No vid links
<twilight_sprinkle> damn im too slow
<thelonepony> no video links during stream
<Sumica> 00,10I have no idea what you meen Klumzeedragon >_>
<Dken2021> so...this movie's still going....
<Ninjazz> What they said.
<Eli> watch it robotdragon9
<robotdragon9> sorry bout that forgot
<Herostar> AND BOOOM
<Wrek> 05robotdragon9: good
<Snowflake> nop[e
<Dark_Horst> otakon: yeah, lots of the equipment reappears in the movie world. especially armor and guns
<Herostar> oh god ik this scene
<Wrek> 05next time you forgettign will not save your ass
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: Oh you know what? I must be mistaken. <_<
<Sumica> 00,10da shit is this, starcraft trys to optamise now/
<Herostar> shit this won't end well ;~;
<Kandarihu> By this point in the movie, half of the community wanted Carmen's head on a silver platter.
<Eli> Wrek: the mod with no mercy
<Joy> :)
<DerpyMuffins> Do they not have airbags in the future?
<Atheist> 3kw is + to 2581261.9502868 calories so thats wayyy more than enough to suport the buglife
<twilight_sprinkle> bugopolis
<otakon> >Fighting giant goddamn bugs
<Wrek> 05Sumica: yeah they otimize to remove uneeded files and tidy up the isntall to take less spaec
<Snowflake> stay i nthe space proof glass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<DaringDerpy> I wonder if they will make a movie of "Old man's war"
<otakon> >takes a LITTLE damn K-Bar knife
<otakon> brb
<Michael> situation is somewhere
<Fl00t4hSh41> Dark_Horst: Quite right. The Starship Troopers guns and armor reapear in Firefly as Alliance infantry kit
<Herostar> awww shit i was right >~<
<Sumica> 00,10I just installed it how dose it know what it dont need?
<Kandarihu> I think the bugs can speak better for the humans' situation than Carmen.
<twilight_sprinkle> damn
<Dken2021> there goes the leg
<robotdragon9> up dat *ss
<MLP_Brovakiin> butt stab
<Michael> awww yeah
<Major> Right in the ass.... ._.

<Snowflake> he smiled
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03what a trooper~
<Atheist> 3kw is more than enough to suppport buglige
<otakon> Sumica: it requires Battle.net to run, start it up and it'll auto update
<Atheist> life
<FillyFlam> "Sorry buddy."
<Cameh_Dude> :'(
<Herostar> she's not already dead
<Dken2021> he was right, she was good as dead
<Dark_Horst> she acts well
<SafariMonkey> Atheist: No, it's 62000 cal/day
<DaringDerpy> braaaainzzzz!
<Michael> little bugs!
<Dken2021> thus the little bug children will feast
<robotdragon9> the book wasnt much like this actually
<Major> o_O
<pony_300> there was a book of this movie?
<Fl00t4hSh41> He seems remarkably calm for someone who has a giant alien arm sticking through his leg
<Atheist> is that per bug SafariMonkey
<Major> and a game
<Percy_Vee> There was a book first.
<robotdragon9> the movie was originally a book
<Caramel> 2,14 the book came WAY before the movie
<Wrek> 05other way around pony_300
<Dark_Horst> pony_300: no. there was a movie of this book
<Sumica> 00,10just seems silly that before I even patched the game it's deleting parts of it
<pony_300> hah, well the more you know
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Yes, movies based on books tend to some out after the movie -_-
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03come*
<Sumica> 00,10did you know they did an anime that folows the book closly Caramel?
<SafariMonkey> Atheist: assuming 3m^2 area
<Caramel> 2,14 I heard, but never saw it
<Dken2021> Scoot-Scootaloo it worked for twilight
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03...anime?
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Michael> gotta watch dat anime
<Ninjazz> Earth Defence Force?
<Fl00t4hSh41> The book was from back in the 70'ies or some such
<Sumica> 00,10they did a good job on the anime
<Caramel> 2,14 was it any good?
<Eli> the question "there was a book of this movie" is surprisingly hilarious... when is there ever a book made from a movie?
<Wrek> 05Sumica: i love the way the marauders were in that
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I have a feeling the aliens have more tentaces in the anime...
<Dark_Horst> and here comes the giant vagina bug
<Major> Caramel: you should stream the game some time :P
<Percy_Vee> Quite frequently.
<Caramel> 2,14 what I've always wondered:
<Sumica> 00,10and yeah the marauders were good
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: don't got here
<otakon> Caramel: yes?
<Caramel> 2,14 why the hell doesn't he keep the knife for himself?
<twilight_sprinkle> its the advisor
<Eli> tha brainbug...
<Kotano> Eli It happens very often,actually
<Dark_Horst> you also play a marauder in the game
<Fl00t4hSh41> Eli: Theres a lot of books based on the star wars movies
<otakon> Caramel: no idea
<Herostar> brainsucker
<Michael> dat fat bug
<twilight_sprinkle> dat boner
<Dken2021> a peace offering?
<Snowflake> vagina face vagina face vagina face haahah
<otakon> nope
<Major> eeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwww
<Wrek> 05vagina spiiike of heeeell
<alexxm|colt> well that doesn't look suggestive
<otakon> bug boner
<Herostar> dear god it's disgusting
<Squallken> mind rape time
<Axel_Dash> ewwwwwwwwwwwww
<Eli> Fl00t4hSh41: apart form fanfiction
<Nittany_Discord> Eww.
<otakon> and then PENETRATION
<Fl00t4hSh41> It just wants to give hima hug
<twilight_sprinkle> Dken2021: if your peace involves holes in your head
<Fl00t4hSh41> A brain hug mind you
<Kotano> I,for one,should still have my book of Pokemon:The first movie lying around somewhere
<Michael> bug want to nomz brains
<Fl00t4hSh41> But a hug none the less
<thelonepony> ded
<Ninjazz> Sweetjeesusthat'sterrifying.
<otakon> and STAB
<Squallken> not again
<Atheist> if each bug produces enough light energy to make the equivlent of just 2000-4000 calories then the bugs
<Dark_Horst> mindfuck redefined
<JT> omg
<robotdragon9> brain eater
<twilight_sprinkle> again?
<twilight_sprinkle> same spot
<Major> O_O
<Dken2021> another accidentall buffer
<pony_7007> AGAIN!
<twilight_sprinkle> as yesterday
<Kandarihu> Oh, it buffered here last night, too.
<Nittany_Discord> Eww.
<robotdragon9> great special effects
<Dark_Horst> slurrp sluuuurrrrrrp
<otakon> actually that should be damn near painless
<Klumzeedragon> Like a juice box. :)
<pony_300> we sure that buffer wasn't intentional?
<otakon> the brain can't feel ANYTHING
<Herostar> that has to hurt like a bitch
<alexxm|colt> mm brain slushie
<Nyst> Yum.
<Michael> tastes liek chicken
<otakon> Herostar: brain has no nerve endings
<Percy_Vee> But the hole in the skull probably smarts a bit.
<Fl00t4hSh41> otakon: But the skull around it can
<Herostar> and now they're saved
<Sumica> 00,10other then the part where it punches a hole throught your skull otakon
<Dken2021> otakon your other senses would go to crap anyways
<otakon> Fl00t4hSh41: only for a second
<SafariMonkey> Atheist: You mean recieves
<twilight_sprinkle> what if...there really is no buffer actually...
<Axel_Dash> why didnt he keep the brain for himself lol
<Axel_Dash> I mean the knife
<twilight_sprinkle> its a puhhhh
<Axel_Dash> not the brain xÇD
<Dken2021> looks like a piggy
<Fl00t4hSh41> otakon: Your bones are covered in quite a lot of nerve endings
<Ninjazz> Big, fat, smart bug.
<Fl00t4hSh41> otakon: That includes your skull
<Kandarihu> And the sensation of your brain, your entire throught processes being horribly disrupted.
<robotdragon9> why is this war even happening again....WHY did the bugs launch the meteor?
<linx> what we watchin?
<otakon> Fl00t4hSh41: yeah well that's like saying there is something akin to a painless death
<otakon> robotdragon9: they didn't
<otakon> robotdragon9: it just happened
<Wrek> 05otakon: yes they did
<Wrek> 05they said it even
<Nyst> The trauma alone would make you scream your lungs out though.
<Wrek> 05with bug plasma
<Kandarihu> robotdragon9, if the bugs even did launch it, it was billions of years ago.
<Sumica> 00,10amazing how the 4 of them can kill so many bugs
<otakon> Wrek: the MEDIA
<Herostar> shoulda thrown the damn bomb to kill it when they leave
<robotdragon9> ._.
<otakon> Wrek: FOX News says a LOT of stuff
<Wrek> 05otakon: THE MEDIA IS THE TRUTH
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Propoganda FTW~
<otakon> yeah
<Nyst> Sumica: they're max level.
<Sumica> 00,10when you know whole armys are cut to shreds by the bug before
<robotdragon9> i dont know anything any more ._.
<Michael> M-M-M-M-Monster kill!
<Dark_Horst> robotdragon9: mankinds expansion into space intruded on their territory. being a hive, they were not so cool with that
<otakon> The guns go from 10+ to kill one bug
<Caramel> 2,14 Knowledge is power Sumica :P
<otakon> to 4 to kill a few
<pony_300> Sumica: well perhaps it's the funnel tactic working to their advantage
<Ninjazz> Hero units, Sumica.
<Kandarihu> It's a global government run media that said it.
<robotdragon9> oh well now i know
<Snowflake> run !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<otakon> to 4 to kill dozens
<Snowflake> run!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Snowflake> damit run
<robotdragon9> GOODBYE COOL WORLD
<Fl00t4hSh41> Nice of the bugs to give them time to say their goodbies before they rush them
<Moopy> Tatical nuke ready for launch repreat tatical nuke ready for launch................tatical nuke inbound!
<Shamroc> they like that?
<Eli> to my question, about books made from movies, forget it, i just remembered "50 shades of grey" but i guess that counts as a fanfiction too
<SafariMonkey> otakon: Better aim?
<otakon> SafariMonkey: yeah I guess
<Atheist> yes i do but the point is is that the bugs could probably generate enough energy to support there life, i mean they must generate enough energy photosynetically to survive because there is no other way for them to survive
<twilight_sprinkle> oh thank you cave
<Sumica> 00,10just just out run the fire, no worry about the air presure wave or the radiation
<EleanorAwesome> Movies
<Snowflake> they eat there own poo
<CrimsonPhoenix> Welp now to wait forever until the finale of turnabout storm
<SafariMonkey> bye Atheist?
<Ninjazz> I don't have time to worry 'bout dat.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Sumica: Or the way the cave would focus the blast to amplify it
<Atheist> what no i just refreshed
<Dken2021> Sumica it worked for every other action protagonist
<Michael> wat
<SafariMonkey> Atheist: random cutout on yor part
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: also, every kid knows that you can outrun a fire wave in a tunnel
<Nyst> You can tell the thing is terrified.
<Atheist> yes
<AdamTheDuck> Victory music~
<Michael> they catched it!
<Nyst> After all, humans are the invaders here.
<RanbowDash90> explosion 10/10 lol
<otakon> eeyup
<Dken2021> does that mean they won?
<robotdragon9> technically yes
<mentallyeffedguy> the future is now kill the giant brain
<Eli> how did they do that so fast?
<Snowflake> vagina face hahahah!
<Herostar> it's still alive
<Nyst> There are several brains.
<otakon> still has the oozy slimy gina face
<Dark_Horst> giant vagina bug whisperer

<otakon> Dken2021: AJ doesn't have wings and FLYING to improve your long jump is DEFINITELY cheating
<Sumica> 00,10it's called a long jump Dken2021
<twilight_sprinkle> so basically pegasi are as athletic as earth pnies PLUS they have wings
<CrimsonPhoenix> this episode needs more Rarity
<otakon> Dken2021: not short flight
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<Michael> you cheater!
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: only RD
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: yeah but they suck at growing plants usually
<Unnr> Would somepony be nice and help with a hair-colour decision?
<otakon> Unnr: for what?
<Unnr> Queen Chrysalis custom
<otakon> ....
<Dken2021> still, no set rules
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: theyre bost one of the best athletes. they both won in equestria competitions
<Unnr> Trying to decide between : http://imgur.com/nMxIf or http://imgur.com/FfpoC
<Sumica> 00,10Unnr, plad. You can never go worng with plad
<otakon> light emerald green, flat should work
<Eli> Unnr: go for rainbow. always use rainbow
<Snowflake> brohoof
<otakon> Sumica: plaid
<fluttershyFTW> BROHOOF
<Atheist> only 4 ponies< RACIAL DISCRIMINATION
<CrimsonPhoenix> Unnr, for tail?
<SafariMonkey> poor spike
<DaringDerpy> haha
<Unnr> Mane and tail, but tail is easiest to plan with
<Kandarihu> Caramel, I see you're using the 1080p version. Back to a good computer?
<Nyst> non-ponies not allowed to compete.
<otakon> Unnr: second choice
<Dken2021> Unnr second one kinda looks better
<JT> Pinkiepie with her random comments ^^
<otakon> THE EYES!
<Eli> was that trixie?
<Michael> derpy
<otakon> LOOK AT HER EYES
<JT> derpy ^^
<Caramel> 2,14 ...when have I been on a bad computer...?
<Unnr> I was fearing that...
<Snowflake> there a pony in a bucket on my screen
<CrimsonPhoenix> I suppose the lighter blue
<Unnr> >_<
<otakon> Unnr: why?
<otakon> dat smile
<fluttershyFTW> ooo
<Hipster-Pony> :P
<otakon> and then they were into bondage
<Dken2021> Unnr not enough hari?
<twilight_sprinkle> kinky
<Unnr> otakon: that is a custom blend between a really violent turquoise and the darker colour
<Atheist> acourding to ajs back shes in 8th place
<Dken2021> *hair
<Unnr> and it has to be mixed by hand
<otakon> Unnr: well that's what works
<CrimsonPhoenix> Unnr, lighter blue just looks better in my opinion
<Sumica> 00,10and then every one said pinkie was a bad comentater because she only talked about her friends
<fluttershyFTW> lol pinkiepie
<twilight_sprinkle> pinkie is biased
<twilight_sprinkle> fire her
<Kandarihu> Caramel, you were around but not using colors. I asked you why and you were understandably upset with me over that.
<otakon> Unnr: custom man, they take time and effort but if you want it to look good you need to do that
<Caramel> 2,14 My Little Announcer: Favoritism is Magic
<Obsidian> dat 42
<Dovah> 42 yay!
<JT> stretching eye muscle's!
<Michael> dat answer
<SafariMonkey> Caramel: Favoritism?
<otakon> lol

<Caramel> 2,14 Yes, because the computer I was on died and I didn't have mIRC on this one until today
<otakon> RD laughs now
*fluttershyFTW facehof
<DaringDerpy> 42
<otakon> but then she loved Daring Do

<Atheist> why is she friends with rainbow anyway
<fluttershyFTW> mmm dat 42
<Kandarihu> I see.
<Michael> dat reference
<PinkiePry> Hai everypony! :)
<alexxm|colt> 42
<Hipster-Pony> hi
<EleanorAwesome> Rainbow is such a jerk
<Atheist> it seems highly unlikely
<AdamTheDuck> Hello PinkiePry
<alexxm|colt> how are you PinkiePry
<otakon> Atheist: well you've never joked around with your friends before on stuff like that?
<Ponies47> Hey PinkiePry :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> funfact
<otakon> hiya PinkiePry
<MLP_Brovakiin> Obsidian: Twilight is the awnser to life, the universe and everything
<Michael> ohai PinkiePry
<otakon> lazy leaves
<otakon> TITLE DROP
<Kandarihu> Well, I've just disrespected two mods in close succession.
<alexxm|colt> title drop
<CrimsonPhoenix> 42 is actually a reference to Alice in Wonderland
<otakon> ...
<otakon> I've never heard that
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: do three and you win a prize!
<Atheist> no i havent, but then agian i dont have any friends -__-
<Snowflake> lazy ass leaves
<Eli> MLP_Brovakiin: except for the question "what's the best book?"
<Hipster-Pony> her freckles were gone
<otakon> and then Spike was speechless
<fluttershyFTW> I LIKE FUDGE
<otakon> his mnd broken
<EleanorAwesome> wut

<MLP_Brovakiin> Eli: Haha true

<Klumzeedragon> SafariMonkey: 63.7% more nose.
<fluttershyFTW> FACEPLANT
<Dark_Horst> well, greta, now we have to shoot her
<Kandarihu> I've honestly wondered if I'd be permabanned by the time S3 premiers. It's looking more and more like I will.
<Unnr> annoyingly the flat dark blue that was 1 is actually closest to Chrysalis blue doing an averaged colour sample
<fluttershyFTW> mmmmm dat 42

<twilight_sprinkle>
<fluttershyFTW> owned
<Michael> ohai Lyra`
<Lyra`> just watching adult films with the sgt
<Caramel> 2,14 AJ sees she was mistaken, tries to catch up anyway
<Caramel> 2,14 RD doesn't see, and starts cheating
<Lyra`> like blade runner
<otakon> eye derp incoming
<Atheist> not really hating everything is kinda fun then u get to complain alot
<otakon> Lyra`: ah
<Lyra`> and saving private ryan
<Michael> it's only a game
<twilight_sprinkle> Atheist: <.<
<fluttershyFTW> ....
<Percy_Vee> And that is where Discord gets his little jab at AJ from...
<Lyra`> really movies that shouldnt been seen by chilodren
<Michael> seems legit
<otakon> suddenly hotdogs
<Lyra`> its just for adults :3
<Eli> this is one of the moments i really dislike RD
<otakon> Lyra`: agreed
<Dken2021> I would consider AJ and dash to be red oni, blue oni
<EleanorAwesome> She's so loyal to her promise not to cheat
<Ninjazz> Caramel, the difference between loyalty and honesty widens.
<Michael> wut hotdogs?
<SafariMonkey> Welcome back where pinky?
<Atheist> i hate everything exluding things i like
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<fluttershyFTW> HEADSHOT
<Caramel> 2,14 yeah, don't really think "Loyalty" is covered in this episode

<Kandarihu> I was planning on starting a Bronystate Team on PSO2 next week. This is going to complicate matters greatly.
<Eli> aj is really bad at this
<alexxm|colt> i'm calling hax
<Ninjazz> It's more like "eye for an eye", imo.
<Caramel> 2,14 though I can't say I wouldn't act the same if I had to deal with RD
<twilight_sprinkle> physics cheater
<Ninjazz> But tempers run pretty hot.
<Atheist> its a difrent dimension

<fluttershyFTW> night*
<Ninjazz> Gnight, everyone.
<Kandarihu> Most cases of races where a major character is racing is presented by only the character being covered by the professional sportscasters without any regard to other racers. It's just like here, but in MLP, it was justified by Pinkie Pie and Spike only talking about the ponies they personally know.
<Ponies47> Scoot-Scootaloo: Server code? :3
<Pale_Horse> Dat Starcraft 2
<Klumzeedragon> Caramel: you going to start streaming SC?

<mentallyeffedguy> Hipster-Pony: have you heard of the cake?
<otakon> that is a BIG sonofabitch
<thelonepony> Heavy cousin!
<Pale_Horse> He's a prisonerer. Therefore he has been selected to star in the next Elder Scrolls game. :D
<otakon> Joy: Starcraft 2

<Obsidian> 626? he is Stich then?
<DashWithRainbows> Not bad. Renegade was an alright shot as an FPS in my opinion.
<otakon> armor up
<killerpony7733> fluttershyFTW multiplayer?
<Herostar> thats jail and today's his day
<Hipster-Pony> I ran out the door
<DashWithRainbows> They should try again, but EA would make so much of the campaign and weapons as DLC.
<SafariMonkey> Good gae graphics or bad movie graphics?
<mentallyeffedguy> Hipster-Pony: you only watched one episode of what?
<otakon> yikes he's being SEALED IN HIS SUIT
<SafariMonkey> *game

<sonicandmario85> Sumica:DONT JINX IT
<otakon> Michael: it's near-permanently attached to his body

<Michael> otakon: IKR
<fluttershyFTW> PEW PEW PEW PEW PEW

<Hipster-Pony> or g1
<Snowflake> hes locked in there foreve pretty much
<FillyFlam> Okay, I change my mind.
<FillyFlam> I -need- to buy this game.
<Hipster-Pony> it was about the ponies getting sent to hell or something

<mentallyeffedguy> Hipster-Pony: have you watched the FIM mlp?
<fluttershyFTW> killerpony7733" i did and apperently im decent most of the time i just pray and spray
<Dark_Horst> otakon: or just exchange years of your sentence against service

<Snowflake> dont like ponys i still love you
<Dovah> Atheist: stop being depressed or the scientificly proven brain god will eat your face :P
<cowvarkian> I just see it as too much of a waste to kill myself >.>
<cowvarkian> And I;m not self centered enough
<Snowflake> depression is the most affected most of the time
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> was there ever any doubt ?
<Atheist> i hate everything because i can
<Kandarihu> I swear, why are so many people talking about suicide today?
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: because why not
<mentallyeffedguy> when boringness turns extreme, suicide is the only answer; my motto
<cowvarkian> mentallyeffedguy: thats fucking stupid

<mentallyeffedguy> Atheist: if you hate everything, it is!
<Kandarihu> SirGanjalf, yeah. I'll gladly suicide in games if there's a good reason for it. Only because I can respawn.

<Nife> cowvarkian: Exactly..
<MaxTheBrony> ... :(

<Kandarihu> Atheist and cowvarkian. PinkaPie was talking about it earlier as well.
<cowvarkian> because boredom
*name is asleep
<Petrified_Discord> Atheist: Wouldn't that mean everything has a point?
<cowvarkian> Atheist: well thats your own fault
<SirGanjalf> It's not much of a sadism if you're hurting yourself...
<Kandarihu> Atheist, maybe your world view is all screwed up.
<name> Petrified_Discord: there i fell asleep
<Petrified_Discord> name: Good job

<cowvarkian> hey
<Nife> mentallyeffedguy: Surprised you recognized me with my handicapped k and h dropping off my name
<alexxm> how are things Meanwhile
<DerpyMuffins> Is steam over?
<Atheist> yes the world has a meaning but only from an individuals perspective but try to see things as existance and nothing more and youll see the irellivance of existance itself
<Kandarihu> Atheist, everyone dies. And there's a time and place for everything. I take it that you're a materialist?
<name> back
<Dovah> Atheist: the world would be a great place and have plenty of meaning if you werent around so please do us all a favore
<MaxTheBrony> the stream is temporarly down
<MaxTheBrony> cause no host.
<Flootahshy> HAY GUYS
<Rex_Mundi> Atheist- it all depends on your point of view, a compleatly materialistic point of view indeed has no point. Doesnt meen death has a point either. I hope you dont kill yourself but i dont know what I can say to change your mind, you seem hell bent on hoplessness.
<Meanwhile> Oh boy, I really didn't show up at a good time did I.
<name> evryone dies but no one knows how or when
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai Meanwhile
<name> hey Flootahshy
<Meanwhile> Allo T.
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: not exactly
<Flootahshy> Relegious debate?
<name> no
<Dovah> I honestly would give a raging crap if someone suicided
<Atheist> hopelessness doesnt mean death, that wouldbe equally irellivant
<Petrified_Discord> Flootahshy: Not quite. meaning of life and shit
<name> suicide debate
<twilight_sprinkle> fucking hasbro, raised the price 2.5 times on amazon for sparkly twi
<Kandarihu> Flootahshy, better than a suicide debate.
<Flootahshy> Ah.
<Petrified_Discord> Suicide debate is worst debate.
<Petrified_Discord> Worse than best pony debate
<cowvarkian> not nearly, Petrified_Discord
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<cowvarkian> suicide debate is one of my top 5 debates
<Kandarihu> Petrified_Discord, best pony debates are much nicer than this.
<MaxTheBrony> Why we talking about suicide , it only makes me depressed...
<name> suicide is never on my debates
*name points gun at myself
<name> am i holding this the right way
<Meanwhile> Suicide debate? What's there to debate about?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: id rather have a suicide debate than best pony debate
*Petrified_Discord points gun at name "Put the gun down or I'll shoot"
<cowvarkian> >.>
*SirGanjalf jumps of a cliff
<DerpyMuffins> Guys this is a pony chat and we are discussing suicide.....
<MadSurge> Guys, two weeks ago one of my friends did that, so please change topic. Seriously.
*cowvarkian remembers blazing saddles
<AdamTheDuck> Everyone just shush and listen to some relaxing music :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tCgxhsz8tM
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, Atheist and cowvarkian are talking about killing themselves.
<Flootahshy> HOW ABOUT WE JUST TALK ABOUT HOW PINKIE PIE IS THE BEST PONY
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: Right, and?
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: how the fuck am I talking about killing myself?
<MadSurge> Flootahshy: YES PLEASE
*name points at Petrified_discord shoots"oops"
<Atheist> im not gonna kill myself that would be meaningless
<twilight_sprinkle> Flootahshy: >:I
<name> DISCORD IS THE BEST ANTAGONIST
<cowvarkian> i agree name
<Dovah> Flootahshy: seems to be an odd spelling of Discord but i'll roll with it
<Bronysith> name: villain
<Petrified_Discord> name: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBaSxHVPYyA
<MadSurge> APPLEJACK NEEDS MORE EPISODES
<Atheist> everything is meaningless so i simply divulge in the pointlessness of the universe
<Rex_Mundi> Atheist- That reminds me of a quoet ""Thales was proclaiming that death isn't any different than life. 'So, why don't you die?' someone asked. 'Because there is no difference' he replied."
<name> he gives chocolate rain i have to give kudos to that
<twilight_sprinkle> it would be hilarious if AJ doesnt get a song in s3
<Meanwhile> Well I can agree with that one.
<Petrified_Discord> Atheist: C'mon man...this isn't philosophical anymore. It's just...kinda bleh.
<Dovah> Atheist: please just die so everyone else may lead a happy existance?
<Petrified_Discord> Dovah: WOA DUDE c'mon

<SirGanjalf> twilight_sprinkle: That would be even more depressing than this debate.
<Petrified_Discord> Dovah: Not cool
<Dovah> Petrified_Discord: did you miss my message about me entering douche mode?
<Kandarihu> cowvarkian, sorry. I misunderstood.
<Meanwhile> Problem with atheists Dovah?
<Petrified_Discord> Dovah: No
<Bronysith> http://askprincessmolestia.tumblr.com/image/12816795637 SHUT UP AND LOOK AT THIS
<Rex_Mundi> Atheist: OK dude, your just bumming me out. Is this some form of trolling?

<Petrified_Discord> Dovah: I mean yes
<Snowflake> best song ever in my child hood http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POlRUxMpd64&list=UUT2SpyOpcX7nt6VAfmiQdzg&index=9&feature=plcp
<cowvarkian> its fine, Kandarihu
<Kinixys> Apathy is pretty low on the list of qualties to cultivate.
<Dovah> Petrified_Discord: ah i see

<Dovah> Meanwhile: oh no my view on religion is extreamly flexible
<Atheist> no im not trolling
<RaveBrony> I dont have a silly spray...
*cowvarkian is apathetic...
<Meanwhile> Make a gif, no. But the spray settings are in the options menu.
<Reikim> I don't think that sprays take gifs, though. Do they?
*Dovah douche mode over
<Kandarihu> Kinixys, apathy is not a quality. It's a vice.
<MadSurge> Bronysith: never tried waffles, are they sweet or salty?
<Reikim> Oh, you're looking for an animated gifd.
<Reikim> *gif
<Petrified_Discord> MadSurge: Depends if you put salt on 'em
<RaveBrony> Ive seen moving sprays :o
<CrimsonPhoenix> Snowflake, you had the best childhood
<twilight_sprinkle> Kinixys: true, apaty is just...kinda sad
<Reikim> Yeah
<twilight_sprinkle> *apathy
<RaveBrony> Oh, yeah
<Flootahshy> Atheist: Than why spread your negative influence on everypony else?
<cowvarkian> well, I'm not really apathetic I guess
<Eli> MaxTheBrony: it was about your pic you posted, but i guess that's hours ago. my chat stuck :P
<Kinixys> Kandarihu: Nice one!
<Atheist> in truth i think most of my hatred for everything is BASED ON THE LACK OF A STREAM:D
<Derpy_Hooves> i better get into uniform for the live show at BFF
<Reikim> Supposedly it's possible to take an animated gif and convert it into a VGA format to use it.
<Meanwhile> Misery loves company Flootahshy.
<Reikim> If you have the original I can try.
<Petrified_Discord> Atheist: The meaning in life is stream
<cowvarkian> I just could give no fucks
<MadSurge> Petrified_Discord: ah, it's sorta like pancakes?
<Flootahshy> Atheist: HEY! DONT TALK ABOUT THE BUFFER SHOW LIKE THAT!
<Petrified_Discord> MadSurge: Pancakes are salty?

<PillowPoni> twilight_sprinkle: I SAY HEY, WHAT'S GOIN' ON

<Eli> MaxTheBrony: well, now i'm dissapoint. didn't mean roxas anyways. it looks like riku. and don't tell me you really don't know Kingdom hearts...
<Reikim> Well
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: DID IT BUFFER RIGHT THERE? REALLY? :D

<PillowPoni> alexxm: I'm fine. Played some MvM today. Twas awesomesauce
<Reikim> The problem is getting the right resources.
<name> yeah cowvakian

<Shizuka> 13alternatively those of you with gmod should look up "the elements of computing systems" and build a cpu with wiremod

<Spell-of-Gaming> As a weaboo would probably say it: "OMG THE OLDER GENERATIONS ARE NICE BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY KAWAII DESUUUUUUUU"
<JESmith71> Kinixys: Really? Then have her play Rainbow Dash's mother.
<CrimsonPhoenix> everypony ready?
<Rex_Mundi> Has everyone here watched the CR retrospective of MLP? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K2aIA6nOiw
