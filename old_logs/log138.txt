<Sumica> Dont copy that flopy
<Nittany_Tiger> And maybe always-on systems.
<prince-dari> "Having fired these encouraging salvos at the gaming community, Kotick then switched his targets to console manufacturers, who he seems intent on putting out of business by "untethering" Activision games from other-party hardware. "I think what the untethered Guitar Hero does is equal the playing field a little more and give you some leverage with first parties when it comes to downloadable content and the business model.""
<prince-dari> LEVERAGE
<prince-dari> DFSAPLFKASD:LFAKSD:FLASKDGLA:DFGH
<prince-dari> HE WANTS LEVERAGE
<prince-dari> HE WANTS IT NOW
<RobotPinkie> 06,15always-on systems would be really bad, but I doubt most companies will use it.
<Diftraku> dari, can I set mode +kb on Kotick, please?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15DRM has been there since the NES, so that I don't really worry about too much. :P
<Nittany_Tiger> Some companies love Always-on.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15for consoles, though?
<Diftraku> *cough*ubisoft*cough*
<prince-dari> Lawl Diftraku.
<Nittany_Tiger> ID and Tripwire have said that they supported always-on DRM.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I have no doubts Activision is looking into it, but eh...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Realistically, what Activision games are worth getting? :P
<Diftraku> SecuROM is a piece of shit rootkit that deserves to be annihilated from orbit
<Diftraku> It's no better than the viral/trojan rootkits out there
<Flaria> I support Diftraku in that.
<Randall1160> BACK
<Randall1160> :D
<RobotPinkie> 06,15If one of the big three would allow always-on on disc-based games, just watch the people flood over to the other two...
<Nittany_Tiger> RP: Buy Call of Duty. It's the /only/ thing Activision has going for them.
<Randall1160> Done buy call of duty
<Randall1160> dont
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I have CoD4, it's pretty good.
<Diftraku> Steamworks, well it works when Steam doesn't crash or disconnect
<prince-dari> CoD4 campaign.
<Randall1160> I stopped palying after WAW (5)
<prince-dari> I love it.
<Nittany_Tiger> I loved CoD 4.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah I don't play CoD online...
<Nittany_Tiger> I've never played 3 or 6.
<Randall1160> 5 was the last of the orginal COD franchise
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Campaign is great though
<Nittany_Tiger> I've played some online.
<prince-dari> The pack of dogs was the best thing ever.
<prince-dari> That was so awesome. XD
<Nittany_Tiger> Mw2 is a mess.
<prince-dari> MW2 I like as well.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15well.... part of it is great
<Randall1160> I was a fan of Call of duty since it came out, its sad to see it go down the tube, I hate ti now
<RobotPinkie> 06,15There's a fairly long section that I found kinda awful
<Diftraku> I had both MW1 and 2
<Nittany_Tiger> I love the older ones. More story-driven.
<Randall1160> same
<prince-dari> Campaign was too short, though special ops was fun
<Nittany_Tiger> Now it's all MP.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15CoD4 had an amazing ending though.
<Diftraku> I took them both to the store after I finished the campaign that was piece of crap
<prince-dari> MW2 I liked the multiplayer.
<Randall1160> exaclty, and MW3 wont have anything Black ops did
<prince-dari> Because SnD, quickscopes.
<Randall1160> multiplayer wise
<Nittany_Tiger> And I suck at MP so I don't care about it.
<prince-dari> It was fun, I can't deny.
<Randall1160> the only reason why COD stays in business is because people buy it hoping to be good
<Randall1160> but even whens its not, its doesnt matter becasue they already bought it
<Nittany_Tiger> And it's hyped to hell every year.
<prince-dari> Black Ops, I REALLY disliked the MP.
<prince-dari> Campaign was average.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I feel kinda like a fanboy for saying Killzone is my favorite FPS series :P
<Randall1160> I remember back with 2 and 3 when it was 2 or 3 years before one came out
<prince-dari> Zombies was fun.
<Randall1160> THOSE WAS DIFFERENT TIMES
<Randall1160> WERE*
<Randall1160> zombies is kinda fun although the new maps are very outlandish
<Flaria> prince-dari: Black Ops MP is the only time I've ever seen you be able to burst fire into the back of someone's head and have them live to turn around and kill you with a single bullet
<RobotPinkie> 06,15KZ2 has the dumbest plot in the history of the world, though.
<EspyLacopa> I remember that one SNES game. . .Zombies ate my Neighbor?
<Nittany_Tiger> All FPSs are going MP-centric.
<prince-dari> Flaria: LOL
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't follow the franchises I used to anymore.
<Randall1160> I switched to PC slowly, becasue consoles suck now, to many FPS games
<Nittany_Tiger> Like GoW, Halo, or Resistance.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15All shooters in general, not just FPS games
<Nittany_Tiger> Too damn expensive to anyway.
<Randall1160> So many new games are generic Carbon copy FP Shooters
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Lots of TPS games going more MP centric, too.
<EspyLacopa> I prefer my FPS gaming on a PC. I like the finer control the mouse gives over the dual analog style that most console FPSs use.
<Randall1160> ^ I agree
<prince-dari> Timesplitters FTW
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't have a preference.
<Nittany_Tiger> I loved Timesplitters.
<Randall1160> the PC has a MUCH WIDER selection of games though too
<Nittany_Tiger> Especially #2.
*Flaria glomps prince-dari
<Flaria> TIMESPLITTERS
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I prefer my FPS games with motion controls, lolololol
<Flaria> Fuck YES
<Randall1160> LOLOLOL
<Randall1160> TROLOLOLLLLLLLL
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Dead serious, actually :P
*Flaria is listening to Anaconda at the moment
<EspyLacopa> Metroid Prime 3, RobotPinkie?
<prince-dari> INB4 I have to dig out my Timesplitters game, and replay them all on my PS2 now.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That's what convinced me it was a good idea, EspyLacopa
<Randall1160> lol I did that oevr someone elses house becasue i dont have a PS2 anymore, was quite fun
<RobotPinkie> 06,15KZ3 pretty much cemented it.
<Flaria> RobotPinkie, EspyLacopa: MP:3. <3
<Randall1160> 2 MORE DAYS!
<Randall1160> then 2 weeks >..>
<Zephirdd> I'm out bronies~
<prince-dari> FPSs on Wii.
<prince-dari> Eugh.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Later, Zephirdd
<Zephirdd> night night
<EspyLacopa> One of these days, I need to snag the trio pack of MP 1-3 for the Wii.
<prince-dari> NOT WANT
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Not ALL FPS games on Wii, prince-dari
*Flaria hugs Zephirdd goodnight
<Flaria> Sleep well :3
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Most have really shit controls...
*Zephirdd hugs bronystate :3
*Zephirdd hugs Flaria in response <3
<Randall1160> farewell Zephirdd
<Randall1160> oops spelling erropr
<Randall1160> BUT YOU GET TEH POINT C:
<EspyLacopa> Shitty controls in any game is a sign of bad or no testing.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Same on PS3, unfortunately... I don't get it, like couldn't they just give all the code for controls to developers?
<EspyLacopa> Shitty controls are hardly restricted to the Wii.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Sony clearly has code for well done FPS controls with Move, so why do third party developers just suck at it?
<ctrlx> itc: games suck but we still play them anyways
<prince-dari> Meh move.
*Flaria hugs ctrlx
<Flaria> Hiya, you.
<prince-dari> Move is a wiimote with a flashing bobble on top.
<Randall1160> I dont like how there trying to force Motion Control on us, Just like 3D, I HATE 3D and grenades but thats another story'
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You don't have to like it, prince-dari :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I love motion controls when done right, though.
<Randall1160> true true
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That goes for both Wii motion + and Move
<ctrlx> flaria, hiya :3/
<ctrlx> also, my contribution to the discussion: PC PWNS
<Randall1160> lol so true
<Randall1160> just its expensive to upkeep
<ctrlx> @pwnymeter ctrlx
<SuperBrony64> School's out! Time for Ponies! How's it going everypony?
<Flaria> No steven :C
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I like pretty much all formats, I just don't have a very good PC...
<ctrlx> awe :<
<Flaria> Hiya SuperBrony64
<Sumica> Hi SuperBrony64
<prince-dari> For me, motion controls are a great idea.
<EspyLacopa> http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=294
<ctrlx> pc cost about the same since games and other stuff is soooo easy to pirate for
<ctrlx> although 360 isn't hard either
<prince-dari> Nintendo were really pretty innovative and interesting (as always).
<prince-dari> But they just don't work.
<ctrlx> and wii is just pathetically easy
<EspyLacopa> At least the 3DS isn't as bad as the Virtual Boy.
<prince-dari> They seem like a great idea, pretty much everyone bought a wii.
<EspyLacopa> And the Wii's motion control is far superior to the Power Glove.
<prince-dari> But nearly everyone I know who has one doesn't use it any more.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pffft, motion controls work great in the right games.
<prince-dari> It was kind of just a novelty thing.
<prince-dari> It's worn off.
<ctrlx> i'd rather have surround view
*SuperBrony64 <3 Nintendo
<Dashite> I still use mine. :/
<ctrlx> that's more imersive than motion sensing
<EspyLacopa> Motion Control and 3D video is hardly a new idea though.
<SuperBrony64> Back to the ole Virtual Boy debate huh?
<Flutterguy> Hey guys,
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lawl, Virtual Boy debate.
<SuperBrony64> Hey Flutterguy
<EspyLacopa> What's there to debate?
<Nittany_Tiger> Look at what I just found.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15There were 3D graphics in the 80's, too :P
<Nittany_Tiger> http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/113229-SCOTUS-To-Blame-For-Sonys-Terms-of-Service-Changes
<SuperBrony64> Everypony WHO'S ANYPONY knows the Virtual Boy was the god among video game consoles that got killed off before its time.
<EspyLacopa> There were 3D graphics in ye olde black and white photography.
<Dashite> #D goes back to the beginning of time.
<Dashite> 3D*
<Randall1160> there were color Televisions back when it was invented!
<Randall1160> but oh well
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Not sure a singularity would count as "3D", Dashite :P
<Nittany_Tiger> You mean 0D
<Dashite> RobotPinkie, maybe. Maybe. :p
<Nittany_Tiger> . = 0D. - = 1D. Shape = 2D.
<EspyLacopa> http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1700_1799/jaipur/jaipurcity/stereoscopic1903b.jpg <-- Ye Olde 3D
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I like 3D, I like motion controls... I know that among gamers that usually means I'm in the minority, but eh...
<SuperBrony64> Technology doesn't just come out of thin air like at an Apple keynote. There are a lot of technologies that are fully developed but haven't become cost-effective enough for the consumer market.
<Dashite> Even if the game wasn't great, Conduit still has the best FPS controls on console.
<SuperBrony64> Dashite: I agree with this statement lol
<EspyLacopa> http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1700_1799/jaipur/jaipurcity/streets1903.jpg <-- Have some more Ye Olde 3D.
<prince-dari> I take 3D to mean like 3D films.
<Flutterguy> Ye Olde 3D?
<Dashite> SuperBrony64 and they put all the sliders in the options menu so you could fine tune it to your preference!
<Flaria> yay stereograms!
<prince-dari> What do you mean by 3D games, I'd guess not games that require 3D glasses?
<prince-dari> You mean flat 3D games? XD
<SuperBrony64> The biggest flaw with 3D films is how they choose the focus the action.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I like 3DTV, lets put it that way.
<ctrlx> the biggest flaw is that there are really only two depths
<prince-dari> I don't like 3D films.
<SuperBrony64> Big example off the top of my head is Avatar.
<ctrlx> near and far
<Dashite> I hate the focus thing!
<prince-dari> I think the 3D adds nothing.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I think it's generally pointless for movies, though
<prince-dari> And all it DOES do is screw up the colour/quality of the film
<RobotPinkie> 06,15For games, it does add quite a bit
<ctrlx> i think it adds something. but it's just not enough
<Dashite> 3D movies give me headaches. :/
<ctrlx> games it does add more
<EspyLacopa> I won't be impressed with 3D movies until it's fully holographic to the point where you can put the audience in a full 360 degree ring around the hologram.
<SuperBrony64> For example, if you remember those seed…things, that float around all the time, they are extremely out of focus while the background is in focus (as to where the action is).
<EspyLacopa> Kinda like a small stadium.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15For ponies, I don't think 3D would add anything.
<EspyLacopa> Wherein movies will actually be a bit like a far more impressive form of Theatre.
<Dashite> I know exactly what you mean SuperBrony64. And when you try to look at them and they don't come into focus and it screws with your eyes. >_<
<prince-dari> Good night everyone.
<SuperBrony64> Night prince-dari
<Flutterguy> Good night Dari
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Night prince-dari
*Flaria hugs prince-dari goodnight
<Dashite> Night prince-dari
<SuperBrony64> Anyway, I think 3D adds a lot of effect to movies/games. It isn't REQUIRED, but it certainly makes a movie more appealing for me.
<prince-dari> Eugh 3d
<Randall1160> I dont like 3D
*prince-dari is gone
<Flutterguy> I don't mind 3D..
<Randall1160> It screws up my eyes
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I think it's mostly for games, really... Much easier to see where you're jumping exactly, or where everything is.
<Randall1160> usually strains them, then I cant see 2 feet in front of me for probably about 4 hours
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: My favorite use of 3D haha.
<Dashite> That really sucks Randall1160
<Randall1160> lol
<Dashite> Worse than the headaches I get. :p
<Randall1160> my eyes are normally fine, but 3D
<Randall1160> UGH
<SuperBrony64> Super Mario 3D Land is really bringing that aspect as a core gameplay mechanic.
<AllisZero> Discussion on 4chan brightened up my day.
<Randall1160> 4chan? O_____O
<SuperBrony64> AllisZero: Topic?
<AllisZero> Anonymous 09/22/11(Thu)20:42:33 No.354786373 How can ships travel at warp speed without crashing into planets and asteroids?
<Flaria> What discussion, AllisZero
<AllisZero> Few replies later,
<Flutterguy> Oh damn, what's this about 4Chan?
<AllisZero> *>>	Anonymous 09/22/11(Thu)20:55:33 No.354788278 A caveman wants to know how you can drive at 65mph without smashing into trees, rocks and mastodons.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I wish I had a 3DTV so I could play Prince of Persia trilogy in 3D....
<Randall1160> I go by the rule that everything that ends in chan is bad news
<Randall1160> excepy for jackie chan
<SuperBrony64> AllisZero: Haha, exactly.
<Randall1160> hes col
<Randall1160> cool*
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lawl, AllisZero
<Dashite> We need a Jackie Chan movie.
<AllisZero> Hahaha
<SuperBrony64> Except, at least in Star Wars, they calculate a route before going into Light Speed.
<Flaria> Dashite: Little Big General?
<Dashite> Flaria, haven't seen that one.
<Flaria> Err, Little Big Soldier*.
<AllisZero> The thread quickly derailed into trolling everywhere
<Flaria> also, inb4copyrightinfringement
<AllisZero> But that comment made me lol pretty hard
<Randall1160> lol didn't Einstein prove that moving faster that light is impossible for humans to survive?
<SuperBrony64> Copyright infringement.
<Randall1160> then*
<EspyLacopa> If I had the money to buy a 3DTV, I'd instead use that money to get a kickass new computer and two widescreen TV/Monitors.
<Randall1160> ^ YEA BUDDY
<Flaria> Dashite: It's pretty recent, 2010 I think
<AllisZero> Einstein proved it was impossible to travel faster than light...
<AllisZero> Which seems to have been disproven lately
<Randall1160> O rly?
<SuperBrony64> Randall1160: Actually, he proved that nothing can ACCELERATE to the speed of light.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm only going to buy 3DTV once it's cheap enough...
<Dashite> Flaria, Little Big Soldier says IMDB.
<Randall1160> thats what I thought, thanks for the confirmation
<Randall1160> wasnt sure sooo
<Flutterguy> RobotPinkie Until then, long live 3 monitors+Crossfire/SLI :D
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: Why not go for the new Playstation monitor that's $499?
<Randall1160> thats why I dont get why they still use it in movies and game and such
<Flaria> Dashite: I corrected myself :<
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Because it's so small, SuperBrony64 :(
<Dashite> Oh, I missed the correction... I wasn't highlighted in green. >_>
<Dashite> It*
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: True, but, for me, it's a perfectly fine size.
<EspyLacopa> Maybe add in a new desk + chair to go with awesome new computer and dual monitor setup.
<AllisZero> Flutterguy: I'm actually thinking of going AMD with my next build/GPU if NVidia doesn't come up with something similar to the whole multiple display thing
<Randall1160> I just signed up for the World of planes beta
<Randall1160> SO PUMPED
<Diftraku> G'night, I'm off to hit the hay
<Randall1160> and for MLP ina few
<Flutterguy> Good night Diftraku
<Randall1160> Cya Diftrak
*Flaria hugs Diftraku goodnight
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Maybe they'll release another one that's 32 inches or something, SuperBrony64, then I'm all in :P
<Flaria> Sleep well!
<Flaria> :3
<AllisZero> Night Diftraku
<Diftraku> :3
<Dashite> AllisZero, you mean like nVidia Surround? I think that's what they called it atleast...
<Diftraku> Watching last minutes of Titan A.E. on livestream first
<Diftraku> but anyhoof, later
<SuperBrony64> Night Diftraku
<Dashite> Titan AE, fuck yeah! Awesome movie!
<EspyLacopa> Planet Bob?
<AllisZero> Last I checked, a few months ago, Nvidia didn't have anything quite like it
<RobotPinkie> 06,15night Diftraku
<Randall1160> O RLY?
<SuperBrony64> Dancing Ponies?! *runs off*
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm heading off to bed too
<Randall1160> gonna check
<Flutterguy> Dude Titan AE! I loved that movie!
<AllisZero> The theme to Titan A.E. was probably the first song I really, REALLY loved when I was a kid
<SuperBrony64> Night RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Night night everypony <3
<Flutterguy> Bye RobotPinkie
<Randall1160> GOOD NIGHT TO ALL THOSE THAT ARE LEAVING
<AllisZero> Good night RP
<AllisZero> I'm actually leaving myself
<SuperBrony64> Geez, as soon as I get on, EVERYPONY starts to leave :/
<AllisZero> Gonna play with the dog a bit
<Flutterguy> SuperBrony64 At least you have Zoidberg! *cries*
<AllisZero> Then hit the hay, try to get some sleep at least
<FriendshipCannon> SuperBrony64 true story :(
<AllisZero> Good night everypony
<FriendshipCannon> night all who are leaving
*Flaria hugs RobotPinkie and AllisZero goodnight
<SuperBrony64> YOU ALL STILL HAVE ZOIDBERG!
<Flaria> Sleep well, you two :3
<Dashite> AllisZero, I think the major difference is that Surround requires SLI, while Eyefinity just requires a 6xxx card.
<Randall1160> Good night to everypony thats leaving ! (O_O)/" RFAREWELL AVRIOUR or whatever that thing is
<Flutterguy> There, there little one. Good as new! *combusts*
<SuperBrony64> You know what's upsetting? The gap between Episode 2 and Episode 3 :/
<Dashite> I won't be able to see Episode 2 until likely around 2am Sunday. :/
<Flutterguy> Oh by the way, when's Part 2 coming out?
<FriendshipCannon> Saturday
<SuperBrony64> Haha, I hope that wasn't a SEASON 2 SPOILER :P
<FriendshipCannon> at 9AM IIRC
<Randall1160> lulz @ the dancing Pony post
<EspyLacopa> 35 Hours.
<Flutterguy> Hmm.. getting up for ponies, or sleeping. Which is more important.
<Randall1160> PONIES
<Flaria> PONIES
<Flaria> DUH
<Flutterguy> :P
<Randall1160> Im glad that episode break is next week becasue I wont be around for it
<SuperBrony64> I say, the small horse fellas are indeed of more importance.
<Dashite> SLEEPING!
*Flutterguy brohoogs Dashite (hell yeah sleep)
<FriendshipCannon> I'm gonna miss the live premiere, and will dodge all pony stuff until ponyarchive delivers a download

<SuperBrony64> Flutterguy: For. The. Win.
<FriendshipCannon> According to someones TV listings, yes
<SuperBrony64> Randall1160: At least one week, but my guess is at least 2.
<SuperBrony64> Sunday is when we will know for sure.

<Dashite> I saw an advertisement on campus last friday for a stream of stream of season 2.

<EspyLacopa> Yes, like Luna playing Serious Sam, or DCD playing Super Robot Wars.
<EspyLacopa> Anyone else played Rogue Galaxy?
<SuperBrony64> EspyLacopa: Not me, but I've heard of it.
<Flutterguy> Rogue Galaxy? Star Wars?
<EspyLacopa> Game for the PS2, made by the same people that did Dark Cloud and Dark Cloud 2.
<Flutterguy> No, I haven't..
<SuperBrony64> So yeah, just finished the storybook…definitely some plot holes there.
<SuperBrony64> And character identification issues...
<SuperBrony64> But for the most part, worth $0.99.

*SuperBrony64 hums Winter Wrap-Up
*Flutterguy thinks of Winter Wrap-Up whilst lurking the chat.. ._.
*Flaria listens to trance and daydreams of being at a DJ Pon-3 dance party
<Flutterguy> So how were your days?
<Flaria> Ehh.
<Flaria> I got an exam back. I could've done better, but I was sleepy ;~;
<Flutterguy> Aw, sorry to hear.
<SuperBrony64> :(
<SuperBrony64> I took a quiz today in Thermodynamics.
<SuperBrony64> But…I hope I did well on it :P
<SuperBrony64> Otherwise my parents say "NO PONIES FOR A MONTH"
<SuperBrony64> :P
<Flutterguy> I'm sure you did fine.
<Flutterguy> I don't start school for another 2 weeks though :)
<Flaria> >_>;
<Flaria> Lucky.
<Flaria> I've been on the quarter system up until now
<Flutterguy> Same here. I'll be in the quarter system.
<Flaria> If I still was, I'd be having midterms next week, but instead we're going over the same stuff we did two weeks ago...
*Flaria sighs
<Flaria> Damned semesters.
<Sumica> Damn kids =p
<Flutterguy> Damn world?
*Flaria shrugs
<Sumica> No was just amusing my self you all have school complants still.
<Flaria> I've finished 4- FOUR!- 600+ page books
<Flaria> And done my homework
<Flaria> I miss quarters. T^T
<Flutterguy> Wow..
<SuperBrony64> Wish I could just read a book and be done with the day :P
<SuperBrony64> Also, that's a standard lunch break to Twilight Sparkle :P
<Nittany_Tiger> I haven't been in a quarter system in years.
<Nittany_Tiger> Since grade school.
<Nittany_Tiger> So used to semesters now.
<SuperBrony64> I've never had a quarter system.
<Flaria> I have huge breaks in between classes...
<Nittany_Tiger> Also glad I'm not taking classes.
<Nittany_Tiger> The amount of coding and data production I've done over the past 3 weeks is amazing.
<Flaria> I can just sit there and read for three hours, go to a class, get out and do homework/study for three hours, go to another class, go back to reading....
<Flutterguy> I was in semesters throughout grade school. College I'm going to will be quarter system..
<Flutterguy> Nittany, coding and data production for what?
<Nittany_Tiger> My thesis.
<Flaria> o_o;
<Flaria> What major?
<Nittany_Tiger> Meteorology.
<Flutterguy> Really interesting
<Flaria> Coding for Meteorology? How does that work?
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm doing coding so I can process data and create graphs easily.
<Nittany_Tiger> For my topic.
<Nittany_Tiger> Which is lightning climatology.
<Sebiale> The streaming embeds working on this site again yet?
<Flaria> Oh.
<Flaria> Sounds cool, Nittany_Tiger! :3
<Nittany_Tiger> I actually used GIMP a bit to make an animation showing the flash density oscillations throughout the day.
<Nittany_Tiger> I should say changes.
<Nittany_Tiger> It is cool.

*Flutterguy ...and manages to land on the face.
<Flaria> Night is now 20% cooler
<Xerion> No moon for you
*Flaria uses flames on her hands to stabilize her orbit around the planet, puts on sunglasses and sits back
<Flaria> Awww yeah, relaxation in space.
*Nittany_Tiger sets up Flaria for a TLI.
<Flutterguy> But how do you breathe in space?

*Natleyn hugs Diftraku, hoping he gets better soon
<Diftraku> Ohai Natleyn
*Diftraku returns the hug to Natleyn
<Diftraku> When you'd normally expect to have it around under 10
<Natleyn> D:
<Diftraku> The doc was quite insistive on admitting to hospital the same day they had the second set of blood tests done
<Diftraku> It was quite fun having 4 blood tests in one week...
<Diftraku> The ironic thing is, I've been almost all summer on antibiotes
<Diftraku> I had a serious inflammation in my leg but it was spotted early on
<Diftraku> So yeah, I might need to start living in a bubble xD
<Natleyn> o_o;
<Diftraku> Anyhoof, me aside, how's everypony?
<astohoove> ok
<Flutterguy> Can't complain.. aside from illness, how about you?
<Diftraku> Pulled an overnighter
<Natleyn> Sleepy.
<Natleyn> Annoyed at and loving animating this stupid cursor.
<Diftraku> Somepony was streaming Titan A.E. and Iron Giant so why not :P
<Diftraku> (Over on livestream)
<Flutterguy> No way.
<Diftraku> Whenever I think about going sleeping at 6AM, I always remind myself with http://i.derpy.me/pUn5a.png
<Natleyn> <3
<Flutterguy> Lol
*Diftraku is really a more night time person
<Flutterguy> I stayed up til 6 this morning.. and I was thinking the same thing right before I went to bed.
<Natleyn> I'd go gaze at the moon, but clouds. -.-
*Trollestia likes the night.
<Flutterguy> Amen to that, the night is where it's at :D
<Trollestia> *yawn*
<Revolver> I like the clouds
*Diftraku shakes fist in the air and mumbles "One day... I will wake up early to just watch the sunrise"
*Trollestia is usually up at sunup to hunt.
<Trollestia> ffffffff
<Flutterguy> I dunno what to dooo..
<Flaria> Find the closest person who you can do stuff to without bothering them too much, in or out of chat
<Flaria> Pat them on the head eight times.
<Flaria> Leave without saying a word.

<Flutterguy> Everybody's asleep though.. :/
<Flutterguy> Well thanks ALOT Diftraku, now you made my heart implode and then explode.
<Diftraku> Mine did so many times
<Flaria> Diftraku: That MIGHT'VE actually worked, had I not played Yoshi's Island religiously as a child
<Diftraku> :3
<Flaria> But
<Diftraku> It's still d'awwwww

<Flutterguy> Huh?
<Nittany_Tiger> Laptop keyboard malfunctioned.
<Flutterguy> Didn't think it was you.
<Flutterguy> Doing that, I mean.
<Nittany_Tiger> No.
<Nittany_Tiger> I spilled milk on my laptop keyboard, permanently ruining it.
<Flutterguy> I know.
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, my laptop keyboard seems to have developed a mind of its own.
<Nittany_Tiger> Lemme try to disable it.
<Nittany_Tiger> So it won't eeeeee spam.
<Flaria> Oh!
<Flaria> I thought you were watching Po pi po or something
<Sumica> wait the eeeeee spam was't intended?
<Flaria> Goodnight, #bronystate! :3

*Flutterguy hugs Flaria (good night!)
<Nittany_Tiger> Night.
<Flaria> Sleep well!
<Sumica> Night Flaria
<Nittany_Tiger> Also, can't disable keyboard via software. I'll have to open it up and pull the plug out. May or may not bother.

<Diftraku> :3
<Diftraku> It's awesome
<Trollestia> Pettan, petten, tsurupettan...
<Trollestia> Also, >implying that's shuffling
<Sumica> Well all I can say it's better then I could do so works for me.
<ctrlx> OMG GUYS
<ctrlx> SEASON 2 IS
<ctrlx> DO WE GET CHRISTMAS SPECIAL?!
<Trollestia> NO
<ctrlx> ;-;
<Trollestia> THERE IS NO CHRISTMAS IN EQUESTRIA, SILLY
*ctrlx takes the santa hat off his pinkie pie plush
<ctrlx> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hz7s8FDyzM&feature=related
<Trollestia> Nah, Pinkie can have the hat. She disregards the fourth wall anyway.
<Sumica> but why was tehre a santa costume in taht one shot?
<Trollestia> Because she's Pinkie. She ain't gotta explain shit.
<ctrlx> a non-denominational gift giving holliday would work
<ctrlx> with some similarities to christmas
<ctrlx> they have gifts under apple trees :D
<Trollestia> Nah. Too politically correct.
<Sumica> and they do refere to "awsome holidays" in WWU
<ctrlx> fine how about cellestia's birthday?
<Trollestia> New year's?
<Sumica> they know the exact day of the big bang?
<ctrlx> sumica, cellestia kept track
<Sumica> oh right, good point
<Trollestia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elCj-Y97neI <3
<ctrlx> and luna was born a day later, when cellestia had to poop
*ctrlx throws a wrench in everything
<ctrlx> oh man i really have to pee
<Sumica> oh and for reffrence to the outfit.
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISEC2Y67RPM&feature=player_detailpage#t=1095s
<ctrlx> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4dgz0o7vyQ&feature=related
<Nittany_Tiger> It's a Fox News debate at that.
*Trollestia might try writefagging to alleviate the boredom.
<Nittany_Tiger> Oops. Wrong channel.
<Trollestia> lawl
<Nittany_Tiger> Mentioning a live Republican candidate debate on YT sponsored by Fox News.
<ctrlx> oh boy. i love comedy!
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol.
<Sumica> Fox news the only station where I have the urge to take a folding chair to the back of each of there heads.
<ctrlx> whoah whoah whoah
<Nittany_Tiger> One candidate was talking about how he survived colon cancer (stage 4) only because of privatized health care.
<ctrlx> why am i using 5.3gb of ram
<Trollestia> SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
<ctrlx> Nittany_Tiger, and i bet he HAD MONEY FOR IT
<Nittany_Tiger> Because he could get timely treatment.
<Trollestia> My reaction to FOX.
<Nittany_Tiger> Exactly.
<Nittany_Tiger> He didn't have to have fun with insurance because he could pay for it out-of-pocket.
<ctrlx> Trollestia, that'd make a good youtube video. clips of fox people talking but audioswap with scat singing
<ctrlx> people might not notice the difference though
<Trollestia> True.
<Nittany_Tiger> Kudos for beating cancer, but don't say that you beat cancer because you wouldn't get timely care under govt. health care when you got it only because you didn't have to deal with insurance.
<ctrlx> lol my firefox is using 1.4gb of ram
<ctrlx> :3c
<Sumica> less tab browsing
<ctrlx> Sumica, i also have it set to cache in ram
<ctrlx> ssd so i try to reduce writes as much as possible
<ctrlx> oddly enough, i only have 23 tabs in one window and 2 youtube videos in another
<Sumica> ah well yeah that will do it.
<ctrlx> still haven't seen it that high before. i've probably had the actuall program open for a few days now
<ctrlx> oh wait. one tab is that reactional image thread on ponychan
<Sumica> that one around 2 miles long?
<ctrlx> yah
<ctrlx> still using a shitload of ram though when down to 3 tabs. i'd say it's from having the program open forever
*Trollestia enjoys having a mechanical storage drive.
<ctrlx> one tab. just under a gig
<ctrlx> Trollestia, i have 5 of those
*Diftraku enjoys having an SSD
*Trollestia doesn't worry about writes.
<ctrlx> Diftraku, i have one of those. gonna get another
<ctrlx> Trollestia, nah you just gotta worry about magnets
<Diftraku> ctrlx: Same, I'll even get one for my laptop once I buy one
<Sumica> Used them when I did drafting, did't see the need for personal use.
<Trollestia> >implying a magnet will ever get within 10m of my computer
<ctrlx> Trollestia, and G forces
<Diftraku> I actually have power magnets in 3m radius of my pc
<Trollestia> My computer doesn't move.
<ctrlx> although when i was in a car accident where hte truck rolled 5 times at 80mph my computer was lolejected and it ran fine
<Diftraku> neodymiym or wotsit called
<ctrlx> 4x80gb raid0 array booted up just fine
<Diftraku> :P
<ctrlx> i'm still using two of hte 80's
<ctrlx> seagate ftw
<Diftraku> I might actually invest in a raid
<ctrlx> i'm a raid freak
<Diftraku> I think all of my HDDs are seagate
<ctrlx> if i get another ssd then the only drive not in raid will be my 2tb
*Trollestia has built a few computers in my time, but doesn't know what you're talking about.
<ctrlx> Trollestia, just think of sli for hard drives
<ctrlx> or
<ctrlx> two drives have the same thing on both (incase one fails)
<Trollestia> Redundancy <3
<ctrlx> or if you have many you can do a combination of those
<ctrlx> i just run raid0 because i love living on the edge
<ctrlx> putting 1.6v through a cpu doesn't phase me
<ctrlx> get it? phase
<ctrlx> oh ho ho
<Sumica> *rimshot*
<ctrlx> that was so fucking stupid
<ctrlx> i'm gonna put that on g+
<ctrlx> yah firefox only uses 150mb when first loaded up
<Trollestia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40O46H1Td-A
<Sumica> they do some strange things with [MMD]
<Trollestia> Indeed.
<ctrlx> i like it
<Sumica> did't know they had compatitions for it now.
<Sumica> this one amused me http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YrzwQZuQnc
<ctrlx> i like the part where he makes the car noises
<Sumica> indeed that is the best part
<Sumica> they reay put way too much effor in to that screw attack video.
<ctrlx> which one?
<Sumica> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/rainbow-dash-vs-starscream-at.html
<Diftraku> Sumica: that was awesome
<Sumica> Awsome yes, realy did't not expect them to go that far for the video though.
<ctrlx> that's only mugen though, right?
<Sumica> Not sure if they used Mugen or if they animated it them selves.
<Sumica> gonna reset my network on the off chance that they managed to procces my speed change early.
<Sumica> Would love to say I am supprised, but I am not.
*Trollestia is going to need a new hard drive solely for ponies at this rate.
<ctrlx> Trollestia, 2tb's are cheap now
<ctrlx> and gnite <3
<Trollestia> Night.
<Sumica> Night Trollestia
<Trollestia> Sumica: You misunderstand.
<Sumica> Noting new
<Trollestia> It's morning.
<Sumica> and yes I see it was ctrlx
<Trollestia> k then
<Diftraku> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4TedkQP_hM
<SuperBrony64> Hmm…did I miss anything?
<SuperBrony64> There must be a least one pony still around to talk...
<MrPoniator> So what's today's movie line-up?
<Diftraku> Batman and some other movie I forgot
<MrPoniator> Which batman?
<Diftraku> Begins?
<Diftraku> Not sure
<Diftraku> Sec
<MrPoniator> Well, suppose it's something like that
<MrPoniator> They showed Dark Knight a few weeks back, or so I recall
<Diftraku> 00:07:45 < RobotPinkie> Batman Begins + Babes in Toyland
<Diftraku> Yay for irssi idling
<MrPoniator> Babes in the what now?
<Diftraku> Toyland
<Diftraku> It's the B-movie obv :P
<MrPoniator> I get it, but, what
<MrPoniator> Probably some retarded flick with some blondes acting like idiots in some magical land?
<Diftraku> Probs
<MeteorVenture> hihihihihihi
<MrPoniator> Hohohohohohoh
<MeteorVenture> hihihihihihihi
<MrPoniator> Giggling at the ghostie, are you?
<MeteorVenture> it's off to work we go
<MeteorVenture> after pondering "Hohohohohohoh" i was like notsureifsetup.jpg
<MeteorVenture> but nah i was just saying hi lol
<MrPoniator> ok
<MeteorVenture> just don't forget GOBLINS! GOBLINS all around!
<MeteorVenture> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCiyb2xvAh8
<EspyLacopa> Goblins?
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7zTUIYQVpY <-- Goblins?
<MeteorVenture> i didn't make out very much of that lol
<EspyLacopa> This land is made of LOVE AND PEACE! --> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnzLwuYToCQ
<MeteorVenture> love stampede!
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWcCskvU3vE <-- Heh
<MeteorVenture> lol you know it's true
<MeteorVenture> yet in many games you WILL be split up somewhere.. that's where things usually get fun
<EspyLacopa> Gotta keep your eye on that thief though.
<MeteorVenture> lol ya except for some games
<MeteorVenture> well most i've played probably don't have the thief actually screwing things up for everyone
<MeteorVenture> AFTER he joins you anyway
<MeteorVenture> tomorrow is gonna be awesome.. funday monday? more like funday saturday amirite?
<pony_2346> :D
<pony_2346> 'Tis success. :)
<EspyLacopa> Silly MeteorVenture, tomorrow is Saturday.
<MeteorVenture> lol do you watch any day[9]?
<MeteorVenture> he's a starcraft commentator
<MeteorVenture> he has does this thing called funday monday and basically on that day people who actually care about that do whatever he tells them to do on that day.. for instance "kill people in alphabetical order" so people whose names start with A will have a bad time that day lol.. and he has a new thing for that day every week.. it makes things fun
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey everypony.
<MeteorVenture> also makes for fun replays
<MeteorVenture> especially since he commentates on them
<MeteorVenture> hey LTF:D
<MeteorVenture> how's it going?
<LunaTheForgotten> good, and you?
<MeteorVenture> pretty decent
<LunaTheForgotten> Did Luna ever beat that game last night?
<MeteorVenture> oh.. dunno i wasn't there
<LunaTheForgotten> Oh.
<LunaTheForgotten> She seemed to be having trouble.
<MeteorVenture> which game?
<LunaTheForgotten> Serious Sam 2
<MeteorVenture> lol never heard of it
<LunaTheForgotten> Nether had I.Lol
<LunaTheForgotten> Do you know the movies for tonight?
<MeteorVenture> nope
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey,I'm going to sign out,but I'll be right back.OK?
<MeteorVenture> alright
<LunaTheForgotten> ...and I'm back.
<LunaTheForgotten> I wanted to turn on Pandora.
<MeteorVenture> pandora is a music thingy right?
<EspyLacopa> I think someone said the movies tonight were Batman Begins and Babes in Toyland. Not sure which "Babes in Toyland" though.
<EspyLacopa> Ah, she's gone.
<EspyLacopa> I think someone said the movies tonight were Batman Begins and Babes in Toyland. Not sure which "Babes in Toyland" though.
<LunaTheForgotten> ...now I'm back.
<MeteorVenture> lol pandora is music thing right?
<LunaTheForgotten> Right
<MeteorVenture> alright couldn't remember very well
<LunaTheForgotten> I just looked up Babes in Toyland. It's rated 4.9 out of 10.
<EspyLacopa> Which version?
<EspyLacopa> '34, '61, '86, or '97?
<LunaTheForgotten> '86
<EspyLacopa> Ah, the one with Keanu Reeves.
<MrPoniator> They made a movie like that in '34?
<LunaTheForgotten> I guess so.
<EspyLacopa> The '34 version apparently had Laurel and Hardy.
<EspyLacopa> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babes_in_Toyland_(1934_film)
<LunaTheForgotten> Damn I want that one then.
<EspyLacopa> The actual original version, according to Wikipedia, is this one:
<EspyLacopa> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babes_in_Toyland_(operetta)
<EspyLacopa> From 1903.
<LunaTheForgotten> If you guys won the lottery, which movies would y'all pick?
<EspyLacopa> Grave of the Fireflies and Fantastic Adventures of Unico
<LunaTheForgotten> Stranger Than Fiction and Pod People.
<MeteorVenture> this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQDe3DFv-Dw
<MeteorVenture> probably anyway.. i can't think of anything else i would rather
<LunaTheForgotten> What is this?
<MeteorVenture> arashi no yoru ni
<LunaTheForgotten> Sorry, I don't know anything about japanease movies
<MeteorVenture> i don't think many people here would know what that is so i just posted a video of it lol.. i think people should recognize it before the name
<LunaTheForgotten> Is this an A-movie or a B-movie?
<MeteorVenture> imo it's quite A quality
<MeteorVenture> it's also anime
<LunaTheForgotten> I would watch it.
<EspyLacopa> Grave of the Fireflies I know is an A movie.
<MeteorVenture> well the thing is this movie doesn't have an official dub.. it's fandubbed BUT it's better than many official dubs imo
<MeteorVenture> that's why the name is still japanese despite it being in english
<LunaTheForgotten> Who here remembers playing F-Zero X on Nintendo 64?
<MeteorVenture> never played it myself
<EspyLacopa> Never owned a Nintendo 64.
<LunaTheForgotten> I played it yesterday for the first time in like ten years.
<EspyLacopa> I went from a SNES, to a PS2, to having a Gamecube.
<LunaTheForgotten> I forgot how motion sick it can make you.
<EspyLacopa> And I didn't get the SNES until the n64 had been out for a bout a year.
<LunaTheForgotten> SNES was the bomb. Super Mario World was one of the best Mario games.
<EspyLacopa> Link to the Past.
<EspyLacopa> Final Fantasy VI.
*LunaTheForgotten brohoofs EspyLacopa.
<LunaTheForgotten> Awesome picks
<EspyLacopa> Kefka is still one of my favorite villains.
<LunaTheForgotten> Retro Nintendo was the best Nintendo.
<EspyLacopa> Ye Olde Megaman games.
<LunaTheForgotten> I've got the Megaman collection on Gamecube.
<EspyLacopa> Though I do rather like Megaman Legends.
*EspyLacopa was disappointed when Legends 3 was canceled
<LunaTheForgotten> I never played that one.
<LunaTheForgotten> *any of those*
<EspyLacopa> Old Playstation 1 games.
<LunaTheForgotten> I never owned any Playstations.
<EspyLacopa> hahahaha, The Bronie Collective has snagged another webcomic artist.
<EspyLacopa> http://www.yoshcomic.com/latest.php
<LunaTheForgotten> LOL!
<Foxy747> does the stream start right when the show starts?
<EspyLacopa> Preshow starts in 5 hours, 15 minutes.

<RobotPinkie> 06,15...
<Kimiko> Hi
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Hullo
*Fluttershy` pokes RobotPinkie gently in the back
<RobotPinkie> 06,15:O
*RobotPinkie pokes Fluttershy` back
*Fluttershy` squeaks. >_<
<RobotPinkie> 06,15D'awww
<Baka-Neku> hello ponies
<Fluttershy`> 08,1woke up early again.... ;___; no sun at the right time, again
<Baka-Neku> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/5acfdf1d52242243590eaa79042ed6c5/62304%20-%20abstract_art%20artist%3Apashapup%20flutterrage%20fluttershy%20pinkamena_diane_pie%20pinkie_pie.png
<Baka-Neku> i find this pic awesome and pretty creepy
<Fluttershy`> 08,1o-o
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I would agree with that.
<EspyLacopa> .... . .-.. .-.. --- / -.- .. -- .. -.- ---
<Fluttershy`> 08,1depends on how you look at it
<Baka-Neku> the art style is cool but the pic in it self i find disturping
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I see it as very artistically creative, and the style is reminiscent of that of a stained-glass window
<Baka-Neku> yep
<Baka-Neku> but that grin pinky has >_>
<Baka-Neku> would give me nightmare from now on
<Fluttershy`> 08,1heh... ^^; I guess that part /is/ a little creepy
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I don't think Kimiko speaks Morse code, EspyLacopa :P
<Kimiko> ...lurkalurka...
<Baka-Neku> oh well need to pack so i can visit some friends this weekend =D
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm on the ponynet!
<Fluttershy`> 08,1o-o?
<EspyLacopa> Bill Clinton is a brony?
<Fluttershy`> 08,11He is?
<EspyLacopa> http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/22/the-throwback-my-little-pony/
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Or just lucky....
<Baka-Neku> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/893716aa00a428dc2883aae04e0ef2d3/62303%20-%20artist%3Atorcher999%20everyday_i%27m_shufflin%20twilight_sparkle.gif this made my day
<MeteorVenture> sooooo much hair gel
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It would be cool if Clinton was a brony though...
<MeteorVenture> reminds me of something i heard about "hair cement" or something
<Fluttershy`> 08,1awww
<MeteorVenture> more like "the throw forward" cause.. ONWARD!
<Fluttershy`> 08,1lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15He says the most powerful enemy of the ponies is the cynical grown-up Chester........
<MeteorVenture> like a banana in mario kart
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I will now write angry letters about this
<RobotPinkie> 06,15(actually I won't)
<MeteorVenture> actually in mario kart you usually through a banana forward and slip on it yourself
<EspyLacopa> Well, based on Season 2, shouldn't the answer now be D: Discord?
<Diftraku> rawr
<MeteorVenture> chester mcbadbat?
<EspyLacopa> gasp. Rainbow Dash vs Starscream?
<Diftraku> indeed
<Fluttershy`> 08,1guess
<Fluttershy`> 08,1what
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I'm going to do?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15The quiz was done a couple of months ago, EspyLacopa
<Diftraku> Fluttershy`: photosynthesis?
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I'm going to post something completely unrelated to MLP..! D:
<EspyLacopa> I'm not sure who to root for. . .Dash or Starscream. . .
<Fluttershy`> 08,1but it's funny nonetheless
<Fluttershy`> 08,1XD
<Fluttershy`> 08,1http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/265/0/8/darth_travis_by_tompreston-d4ancbe.jpg
<Diftraku> lol
<Fluttershy`> 08,1sorry, and the brown-haired one's expression in the last panel... o_o
<Fluttershy`> 08,1>>
<RobotPinkie> 06,15:O
<Diftraku> http://i.derpy.me/o5Ookl.jpg
<Diftraku> Doing a bit of stress testing on the new caching system
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Trolluna XD
<Diftraku> So feel free to clicky that
<Diftraku> And let me know if it breaks
<Diftraku> So, how I spent my day?
<Diftraku> I added caching to all database calls in the image short url handler and added support for conditional get
<Fluttershy`> 08,1o-o
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I have no idea what you just said
<Fluttershy`> 08,1but it sounds cool!
<Fluttershy`> 08,1^^;
<Diftraku> All-in-all, when a new uncached image is being requested, it'll take a while to load
*Fluttershy` doesn't understand techie talk at all, unlike FlutterBro13 (her little brother irl)
<Diftraku> But after that the image is returned more faster with less processing server side
<Diftraku> :P
<Fluttershy`> 08,1bah
<Fluttershy`> 08,1RobotPinkie did you understand? >>
<Diftraku> (You open the image twice, it loads faster on the second time)
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Eh.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Kinda.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Get it.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1But not really. XD
<Diftraku> :P
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Trololololo.

*RobotPinkie hugs Fluttershy` back "Thank you"
<Fluttershy`> 08,1.____. I had a really bad night last night 'cause of stupid things involving me and my friend...
<Fluttershy`> 08,1=_=; -sighs-

<RobotPinkie> 06,15People should just like... learn to relax and have some ponies, or something...
<AllisZero> Morning everypony
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Morning, AllisZero
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Ugh. It was more annoying than anything... and it doesn't matter that she likes MLP too. It was like... 'hey look I've been your best friend for three years... but not really. I don't need you any more.'
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Wow, that sucks
*Fluttershy` hangs her head. "Surpisingly, I'm more relieved than anything. Hurt, but relieved."
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey everypony.
*RobotPinkie hugs Fluttershy`
*Fluttershy` hugs back
<AllisZero> I'm catching the conversation a bit late but that sucks, Fluttershy`

<TheDukeofFail> cripes
<TheDukeofFail> ponies is p big in the US
<TheDukeofFail> lol
<MakerDusk> no kidding XD
<MakerDusk> though I'm canadian myself
<TheDukeofFail> I guess ponies is actually on TV in the US though
<TheDukeofFail> that helps
<MakerDusk> so true
<MakerDusk> though anyone with internet has no excuse
<AllisZero> ^
<WhatPayne> Tbh I was not expecting to see Finland so high top there-
<mib_ku4wn5> right beneath Germany, at that
<TheDukeofFail> it's ok, one day everyone will be in the cult of pony
<TheDukeofFail> and love and tolerance will rule the day
<TheDukeofFail> also molestia
<MakerDusk> molestia went to sleep already
<LunaTheForgotten> What are we talking about?
<MakerDusk> aussies and their weird timezone and all
<MakerDusk> LunaTheForgotten: https://gist.github.com/b918a480bb3f2a3d7137
<MakerDusk> server stats
<LunaTheForgotten> The US is way up there.
<MakerDusk> it is
<MakerDusk> though I /know/ there is another brony somewhere in my city
<MakerDusk> I saw the join when episode 1 was about to air
<MakerDusk> it was just scrolling so fast that I lost it
*MakerDusk cries
<TheDukeofFail> :c
<Turgle> i have to find an italian xD
<MakerDusk> you know they exist, at least
<Turgle> at least
<MakerDusk> also, I'm bored
<MakerDusk> so does anypony want a vhost?
<Turgle> CERN: http://i.imgur.com/cDvnU.jpg
<AllisZero> I saw a pretty interesting comparison the other day
<AllisZero> There was a supernova, few thousand light years away, back in 1987
<AllisZero> The neutrinos showed up 3 hours before the light of the explosion did
<MakerDusk> sounds about right
<MakerDusk> if I do recall my astrophysics course correctly
<AllisZero> But this guy's point was that if the scale had been the same, we'd seen the neutrinos in 1984 and the light only in 1987
<MakerDusk> no, because the speed approaches the absolute limit
<MakerDusk> err...
<MakerDusk> yay ponies!!!
<MakerDusk> >_>
<MakerDusk> <_<
<MakerDusk> no physicist here
<AllisZero> Eh, neither am I, but I thought it was an interesting point
<AllisZero> It'll take more than a few subatomic particles acting erratically to shatter special relativety I think
<WhatPayne> But isn't that the whole point of this discovery? That the lightspeed may not be the absolute top limit?
<AllisZero> relativity*
<AllisZero> Yep
<AllisZero> This will spark a debate
<WhatPayne> In that case the comparison with the neutrinos coming from supernova years earlier is correct then.
<AllisZero> But proof will only come with a lot more testing imho
<MakerDusk> light speed is the limit
<MakerDusk> there are ways around it
<MakerDusk> take hyperspace for one
<WhatPayne> But that's just it. What if light speed is not the limit
<MakerDusk> (actual hyperspace not scifi)
<MakerDusk> it is
<MakerDusk> but you have to take warping in accelerated space into account
<MakerDusk> damn it!
<MakerDusk> I did it again!
<MakerDusk> yay ponies
<MakerDusk> hello Luna ^_^
<Luna> 07,1hello Dusky
<AllisZero> Morning Luna
<AllisZero> Well, almost evening there for you :p
<Luna> 07,1yea...
<MakerDusk> >_> you guys are evil for making me break character
<Luna> 07,1I was wondering should I play some more Sam 2?
<MakerDusk> do you want a vhost Luna?
<WhatPayne> Seriously tho. Like one of the article said it's either that light speed is not the limit, or the measuremets were wrong, or the neutrinos used some shortcut.
<Luna> 07,1vhost?
<WhatPayne> At the moment no one knows.
<MakerDusk> that's what I was saying WhatPayne
<AllisZero> Yeah, but it'll spark a lot of debate
<MakerDusk> they used a short cut
<WhatPayne> But what if they did not.
<MakerDusk> Luna: like what giggles has
<MakerDusk> so if you do a whois on him all it says is "giggle@the.ghosties"
<Luna> 07,1sure :)
<MakerDusk> what would you like?
<MakerDusk> I can set anything after the '@' to replace your hostmask
<WhatPayne> And until proven othervise, I still trust that light speed is absolute limit too. But still this iis very curious.
<Diftraku> rawr
<Luna> 07,1hmmm let me think of that :)
<MakerDusk> sure, I'm generally around
<MakerDusk> us Admins are always watching...
<MakerDusk> O_O
*Diftraku hides the plans to take over the world
<MakerDusk> WhatPayne: it's just a matter of what frame you hold constant
<Diftraku> So, you were saying?
<WhatPayne> What do you mean by frame?
<Luna> 07,1now that sounds scary :)
<MakerDusk> c remains constant in most frames, so we choose to hold it constant in all
<WhatPayne> oh
<MakerDusk> what do you think happens to the speed of light when it crosses a time dilation field?
<Luna> 07,1A Sonic rainbow will occur
<Turgle> BOOM
<MakerDusk> or even into a medium with a different refractive index?
<Luna> 07,1sonic rainboom!
<Diftraku> Please hold... computing...
<Diftraku> Fatal Error at line 1: http://i.derpy.me/kIJFD.jpg
<WhatPayne> No no. I believe in scientific method. Until proven othervise Light is still the constant.
<MakerDusk> it's not though
<MakerDusk> it depends of permitivity and permiability
<MakerDusk> but it always depends on only those two factors
<MakerDusk> if n<0 then you can send messages through time XD
<MakerDusk> if n>0 there is lag and refraction accordingly
<WhatPayne> The speed of light in vacuum is physical constant
<MakerDusk> when permitivity = permiability = 0?
<MakerDusk> yes
<WhatPayne> Sorry, but my physics knowlege is quite lacking in this area tbh.
<Luna> 07,1streams up
<MakerDusk> the theory of relativity (not the special theory) explains the spatial distortions that also affect it
<MakerDusk> don't feel bad WhatPayne, there are 7 of us left in my year level
<WhatPayne> Of course. Gravity, and materia effect the speed of light.
<MakerDusk> and I'm taking a year off XD
<LunaTheForgotten> ...and I;\'m back
<AllisZero> Haha xkcd
<LunaTheForgotten> *I'm*
*Luna waves @ LunaTheForgotten
<MakerDusk> I've said that already...
*Diftraku comes back with food
*LunaTheForgotten waves back
<Diftraku> I spent 3 hours debugging code
<WhatPayne> No problemo. It's nice to know someone is interested enough to actually study these matters
<MakerDusk> hmm... maybe I did go a bit too technical
<Diftraku> By brain can't handle math/physics today...
<LunaTheForgotten> Luna,Did you ever beat the game?
<MakerDusk> it comes naturally to me
<Luna> 07,1yea i did
<Luna> 07,1long time ago
<Luna> 07,1will continue in a bit :)
<MakerDusk> 'later Luna
<Luna> 07,1are you leaving Dusk?
<MakerDusk> ...
<MakerDusk> I thought you were
<Luna> 07,1no no
<Luna> 07,1i'm streaming :)
<MakerDusk> XD
<MakerDusk> ah
<Diftraku> What does have to do to get a vhost? Ask nicely? :3
<Luna> 07,1pre-pre-pre-pre show
<WhatPayne> MakerDusk, where are you from?
<MakerDusk> Diftraku: what would you like?
<LunaTheForgotten> I'm happy I will finally be here tonight.
<LunaTheForgotten> To watch the entire movie.
<MakerDusk> WhatPayne: I'm in Canada
<Diftraku> MakerDusk: Haven't really thought about it, just wondering how difficult it is to setup
<MakerDusk> Diftraku: you tell me what you want, I give it to you
<WhatPayne> Oh well that explains how you used those terms such effectively.
<Diftraku> Well, it sure is easier that reverse DNS xD
<MakerDusk> XD
<MakerDusk> WhatPayne: I've got 1.5 years until I get my first 2 BSc degrees
<MakerDusk> and if you're wondering, I'm 21
<Diftraku> o_O
<MakerDusk> and this is ruining my persona as 'the approachable server admin'
<MakerDusk> XD
<MakerDusk> my second major is Mathematical Science
<Diftraku> Well, so far you're the only server admin I've talked to on irc :3
<MakerDusk> not true
<WhatPayne> Usually when someone acknowleges actually studying some subject, it makes me hesitant to say anything on the matter.
<AllisZero> Unless it's computers huh
<MakerDusk> I'm the only one who has identified themself as an admin ;)
<Diftraku> True xD
<AllisZero> Us computer science majors are the shit of the science field
<MakerDusk> WhatPayne: don't worry, I tutor for a few extra bucks
<MakerDusk> you're a lot better informed that the messes I usually get
<MakerDusk> *than
<MakerDusk> good god!
<WhatPayne> I'd be glad to listen, but unfortunately really broke.
<MakerDusk> what happened to our education systems!!!
<WhatPayne> Really? And here I thought I was awful at this area?
<MakerDusk> meh. what I meant was, I don't have trouble explaining
<MakerDusk> and it doesn't bother me
<Diftraku> MakerDusk: Is New.Lunar.Republic fine with you for my vhost?
<MakerDusk> yup
<Diftraku> :3
<MakerDusk> are you a registered nick?
<Diftraku> ee-yup
<MakerDusk> in that case...
<Diftraku> I got irssi idling 247
<MakerDusk> there you go
<MakerDusk> go ahead and /whois yourself
<WhatPayne> I can thank Hawkin and Neil deGrasse Tyson and Lawrence Krauss and others for keeping my interest up.
<Diftraku> Thanks <3
<WhatPayne> On these subjects I mean.
<WhatPayne> And Wikipedia...
<MakerDusk> did you know that Hawking hasn't come up with anything since his original thesis?
<WhatPayne> Well I heard he made a book recently.
<MakerDusk> nothing new
<MakerDusk> yet the physicist who invented true holograms is unknown
<WhatPayne> Well I'll be...
<MakerDusk> I suppose those will be made public in a year or two...
<Diftraku> It'll probably take anywhere from 10 to 15 years for affordable consumer versions?
<WhatPayne> Holograms?
<MakerDusk> at the moment they are only monochromatic
<MakerDusk> but they look like sculpters
<MakerDusk> right up untill you put your hand through them
<MakerDusk> visible from all angles
<MakerDusk> opaque
<Diftraku> Any idea if it needs two opposite surfaces to work or just one?
<MakerDusk> just one
<prince-dari> Hey eXAKR.
<MakerDusk> so table with a random object growing out of it
<MakerDusk> that looks real
<MakerDusk> until you try to touch it
<Diftraku> You can just chuck a 3d model at it and it'll display it?
<MakerDusk> it's done using the Quantum Electro Dynamics
<MakerDusk> to an extent
<MakerDusk> physicist suck at rendering images
<MakerDusk> *physicists
<Diftraku> Confound these ponies, first idea about that hologram was to project ponies...
<MakerDusk> and only still images at the moment due to the extensive quantum mechanical calculations involved in displaying it
<WhatPayne> I'd like to see that discord model
<Diftraku> Discord Shuffling...
<Diftraku> Now THAT is something I'd buy
<MakerDusk> Diftraku: you'd need to find a physicist who could do those calculations...
<Diftraku> Yeah, I can tell they aren't small ones
*MakerDusk hasn't seen the math
<MakerDusk> they kept that secret, the bastards!
<Diftraku> :P
<WhatPayne> http://kirikd.deviantart.com/art/Discord-259222075 I mean this Discord.
<MakerDusk> (from the rendering math, you can derive all their work)
<MakerDusk> that would be an epic statue
<WhatPayne> MakerDusk, exactly what do you mean here?
<prince-dari> MFW I thought that model had been 3D printed.
<Diftraku> :D
<MakerDusk> well, the display is is QED in nature
<MakerDusk> knowing what is is displaying and having the equations for that would let you reverse engineer the structure of the table
<WhatPayne> Yes that is awesome 3D model shat sould be 3D printed.
<WhatPayne> *that
<Diftraku> It's quite epic that shortly after Microsoft released the Kinect development tools to public, they made it into a 3D model scanner
<MakerDusk> same has been done with cameras for ages though
<AllisZero> Fffffffffffff
<MakerDusk> hello Revolver
<AllisZero> This is gonna be such a pain in my ass to do
<AllisZero> Whoever made these folders and shares is an idiot
<AllisZero> And has no idea how a domain structure is supposed to work
<AllisZero> YEAAH let's just share it with EVERYONE
<Diftraku> Oh dear...

<Luna> 07,1hey baka
<Luna> 07,1S2 hd installed yet?
<Baka-Neku> yep..... but im going to go really soon =O some pony is picking me up so i can visit some frieds =O
<MakerDusk> /whois yourself, Luna
<Luna> 07,1cheers MakerDusk :)
<Luna> 07,1now back to serious business
<Baka-Neku> Luna both HD and Classic is done dl XD
<MakerDusk> lol
<Diftraku> MakerDusk: Any idea if the netsplits that happened this morning on ponyirc and geekshed had anything to do with each other?
<Diftraku> Since Steam was wonky all night
<Baka-Neku> YAY i love net splits >_<
<Luna> 07,1great, we'll play SOON!
<MakerDusk> hmm?
<Diftraku> #EQD lost DerpyBot for a long time...
<MakerDusk> I'm not on geekshed so I couldn't say
<Diftraku> They weren't even much apart from eachother
<MakerDusk> and my computer crashed, depriving me of precious oper logs on our netsplit
<MakerDusk> I know we were going to restart one of the servers to add flash client support though
<Diftraku> I noticed the server message :p
<Baka-Neku> ok im off!
<Baka-Neku> =D
<MakerDusk> though such would have only affected die hard pony fans
<MakerDusk> the ones who connect through rarity.ponychan.net and such instead of irc.ponychan.net
<Diftraku> Oh, I still use irc.ponyirc.com xD
<MakerDusk> XD
<Rainbow-Dash> I want Derpybot in here
<Rainbow-Dash> Lol
<Diftraku> 18:54:28 <@DerpyBot> The next episode airs in 0d:21h:05m:30s
<MakerDusk> if you use irc.ponychat.net, you connect negligably faster :P
<Diftraku> Well, I don't DC often :3
<MakerDusk> XD
<Diftraku> ssh + screen + irssi <3
<prince-dari> If you use irc.ponychat.net you're more likely to connect slower.
<MakerDusk> really?!!
<MakerDusk> o_O
<prince-dari> I'd have thought so?
<MakerDusk> that address is a pointer
<prince-dari> Instead of connecting directly to a server, you're connecting to the round robin first.
<prince-dari> Which points you to one of the servers.
<prince-dari> So that surely takes longer than just a direct connection?
<MakerDusk> that dumps you over to irc.ponychat.net
<Rainbow-Dash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nOsm9luUKM&feature=related
<Diftraku> A quick dig returns 4 A records for irc.ponychat.net
<LunaTheForgotten> I really need to get a new modem.
<MakerDusk> also, hello prince-dari
<prince-dari> Hey.
<MakerDusk> I don't believe we've officially met
*MakerDusk is Dusky
<prince-dari> Ah, nice to meet you then.
<MakerDusk> I suppose my main job is keeping everyone happy
<MakerDusk> on that note, would you like a vhost prince-dari?
<Diftraku> MakerDusk: ponyirc returns just an alias for ponychat.net
<Luna> 07,1I like Dusky
<Luna> 07,1it sounds cute
<Rainbow-Dash> So your main job is making people happy eh?
<Diftraku> It's even the same IP
<Rainbow-Dash> Make me happy.. Bring Derpybot to BronyState
<Rainbow-Dash> XD
<prince-dari> Hmm, maybe later MakerDusk, got a couple of things to do.
<Diftraku> I was hoping I'd get few ports opened but it's been couple days after my e-mail now... don't really mind it, getting used to irssi
<MakerDusk> Rainbow-Dash: unfortunately charybdis doesn't allow me to toss selected users into a channel of my choice
<prince-dari> No /sajoin :O
<Rainbow-Dash> Ah, thats a shame. :P
<MakerDusk> nope
<MakerDusk> I know
<prince-dari> Aww.
<MakerDusk> no drunk tossing prudish ponies into clop channels :(
<Diftraku> :P
<MakerDusk> also, no tossing our cells into the oper channel
<Diftraku> http://i.derpy.me/ORa6D.png
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey, which Babes in Toyland are we going to watch?
<Diftraku> Took a while to find it, shimmie being slow
<MakerDusk> anyways, I'm going to go watch some tv
<MakerDusk> 'later
<WhatPayne> cya
<Diftraku> later MakerDusk
<LunaTheForgotten> Bye
<Diftraku> speak of the devil, I just got my ports opened xD
<Luna> 07,1so is the stream up?
<WhatPayne> That souded dirty
<Diftraku> lol
<prince-dari> Hmm
<RainBroDash> 10The stream doesn't seem to be up for me D:
<RainBroDash> 10oh no, it is
<prince-dari> Ok.
<prince-dari> That works.
<AllisZero> wot
<Diftraku> wat
<Diftraku> bronystate.net is not loading atm, I'm blaming my AV for the weekly scan
<prince-dari> Oh, probably our web host derping.
<prince-dari> I thought they might be.
<prince-dari> FTP servers weren't loading.
<Diftraku> no wonder, mine's been doing the same too
<Diftraku> had mysql server crash 3 times
<Diftraku> works now
<Rainbow-Dash> Anyone else played http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRjhtDPxB5E ?

<Luna> 07,1I don't like dead island...was thinking about getting it.. but decided to wait for SS3
<Fluttershy`> 08,1BLAH
<Luna> 07,1and meanwhile play SS3
<Fluttershy`> 08,1B R FREAKING B
<Dashite_with_goatee> L4D challenge level varies.
<Flutteryay> weewoo...
<LunaTheForgotten> L4D was awesome in opinion.
<Dashite_with_goatee> L4D > L4D2
<Luna> 07,1yep
<LunaTheForgotten> I never played L4D2
<Luna> 07,1I love the custom content
<Kimiko> 8trololo
<Luna> 07,1my favorite map is the stadium map
<Luna> 07,1with portal easter egg
<Kimiko> I know how to use colors on this and I ain't saying how haha
<FriendshipCannon> Luna love that map

<Luna> 07,1it's WIN!
<Kimiko> Okay, enough screwing around. I mean, they're probably not going to figure out what symbol it is
<Dashite_with_goatee> 2,15ISo does this work?
<Dashite_with_goatee> Yup
<prince-dari> INB4 they do
<prince-dari> XD
<Kimiko> that little symbol... I don't know how to type it regularly on a keyboard
<Kimiko> I had to copy and paste it from mIRC
<prince-dari> Oh.

<Veewave> I don't like being informed every time someone joins or leaves.
<FriendshipCannon> It's a standard IRC message. I actually prefer to know when people leave. :)
<Turgle> heh
<DashWithRainbows> i like the log in of the chat
<Nat> Oh thank god
<FriendshipCannon> Though at levels like this, I would /prefer/ an option to turn it off
<FlaschenJoe11> at what time is the episode again?
<DashWithRainbows> saves time of having to type in the /msg nick serv
<Nat> theatre/backup/ still uses mibbit
<Veewave> Bleh, I like a litlle mystery in my life.
<Spazturtle> FriendshipCannon same

<LordCelestia> thanks
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you're welcome
<LordCelestia> I'm on the mibbit chat, i don't like the new one
<Diftraku> What doo yoou mean?
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Please bring the Mibbit Back
<Turgle> why don't you all just download an irc client?
*Trollestia is on a client, so gf
<LordCelestia> I like the whole setup, but I don't like how it says when someone's offline, I don't like the black and white everything
<Spazturtle> Same i'm on the mibbit one too
<Octavia> 13
<Natleyn> turgle: mIRC is at the point where it won't even say continue anymore, just exit.
<Turgle> then use xchat
<Spazturtle> i don't like the message telling me who joins and quits
<FriendshipCannon> ja, grab mIRC, XChat, or Nettalk. I've had good experience with all of them.
<Diftraku> Irssi <3
<Octavia> Lets see...
<Dumori> mibbit lags way to much when busy we had 5 min or more lagg on mibbbit last week
<Lolipop_of_Doom> o
<Lolipop_of_Doom> oo
<Natleyn> xchat is just another trial for windows >_>
<Dumori> I wont recomend the client I use
<Octavia> 13 Hmm...
<Spazturtle> Dumori what is it
<Dumori> it's a nasty hack
*Trollestia approves of ChatZilla.
<DSNesmith> dumori don't you use some hacked together custom client lol

<[ger]Brony1> That reminds me on that fake pony-chan chat-cutout-picture of a brony ranting about Luna saying 'Hello'
<DSNesmith> episode where luna gets turned invisible
<Diftraku> I know why there's that gap...
<DSNesmith> and no one notices
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Less Trollestia, more Luna, yep.
<TheMaster> an entire episode of them trying to find luna, turns out she was behind them the whole time
<SuperBrony64> Better yet...
<Diftraku> They'll probably sneak in a 10 second clip of S2 luna
<FlaschenJoe11> Luna trying to live the life of a normal pony
<SuperBrony64> More Luna, Less Celestia™
<[ger]Brony1> Luna vs. Threesome ^^

<Wrek> 05all your faces when me and val really do love eachother.
<AllisZero> Let's see what this new chat is all about
<FlaschenJoe11> Scootalove FTW
<Turgle> mon visage quand
<DSNesmith> I think steven already told us that wrek
<TheMaster> Best Bowie song is Starman
<Straightjacket> I give up
<LordCelestia> AllisZero
<LordCelestia> PM me
<DSNesmith> have we ever watched labyrinth in here
<Natleyn> Only Scootalove <3
<FlaschenJoe11> we totally should
<interior_gummy> so what's different about this chat?
<Natleyn> I don't think so.
<interior_gummy> no colors :(
<Turgle> heh
<Trollestia> Full Metal Jacket GO
<ValtheJean> 2,14 interior_gummy: oo
<RobotPinkie> 06,15No colors?
<DSNesmith> interior you can connect through mibbit
<Wrek> 05what do you mean?
<TheMaster> there are a lot of movies that should be watched
<DSNesmith> and get the good chat back :P
<TheMaster> like fight club
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You can't see our colors, interior_gummy?
<SuperBrony64> White is a color :P
<Dashite> DSNesmith no we haven't watched it.
<AllisZero> Me no like it
<interior_gummy> ooooooohhhhhh
<DSNesmith> if I win b-movie
<DSNesmith> we are watching baby geniuses next week
<DSNesmith> 2
<Natleyn> AllisZero: I know, right? D:
<AllisZero> I prefer the other chat! Give it back
<TheMaster> you evil person!
<FlaschenJoe11> We totally should
<Dashite> RobotPinkie, he can see your colours. The new IRC is just less colourful than mibbit.
<TheMaster> don't let him win mods!
<SuperBrony64> If I'm picked for the movie, I'm picking best movies ever.
<Wrek> 05he already did
<interior_gummy> i feel like watching the incredibles for a movie
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Makes sense.
<TheMaster> i'd pick Manos: The hands of Fate
<TheMaster> but the mst3k version
<DSNesmith> manos isn't even funny
<DashWithRainbows> if i win A movie, i will definatly choose Saving Private Ryan
<DSNesmith> it's just appalling
<[ger]Brony1> Shaun of the Dead
<Trollestia> Full Metal Jacket
<Dashite> Lawrence of Arabia
<FlaschenJoe11> Beastmaster
<AllisZero> It's awfully hard to see people individually now, wow
<Wrek> 05I'd pick the day the earth stood still
<DSNesmith> we can't watch MST3k
<LordCelestia> I think I'll post this every hour or so. This channel is for BronyState regulars ONLY: #BronyStateRegulars <-- This only applies if you come here like every day. Not once or twice a week.
<SuperBrony64> As stated on bash.org, 'IRC is multiplayer notepad'
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Just checking it out now.
<DSNesmith> that's the point of chat
<Combustiblelemons> I still need to see saving private ryan.
<[ger]Brony1> Shaving Ryan's privates
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<DSNesmith> lol @ newfilly posting oldfilly channel
<interior_gummy> b movie, i hope for batman & robin
<Trollestia> I'm usually in here, so...
<DashWithRainbows> :l
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It looks pretty sexy with all that white and then suddenly mod colors.
<Vance> OFF TO ORDER CHINESE WOOOO
<DSNesmith> oh no this thing
<Diftraku> night of the Pony <3
<DashWithRainbows> mod colours = sexier
<Combustiblelemons> my choice would be either the thing or hitchhikers guide to the galaxy for a movie
<DSNesmith> excuse me while I go take some tylenol for this video
<TheMaster> i'd actually pick Kungfu Hustle as B movie
<DSNesmith> the Thing!
<Wrek> 05RobotPinkie <3
<Natleyn> TheMaster: YES
<AllisZero> :D
<DSNesmith> that is a FANTASTIC movie
<Dashite> People!
<Combustiblelemons> man the japanese make some crazy videos.
<Dashite> We need a Jackie Chan movie!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Wrek <3

<Dashite> Police Story

<Turgle> <RobotPinkie> It looks pretty sexy with all that white and then suddenly mod colors.
<Turgle> * Youkai has quit
<Turgle> ops
<FlaschenJoe11> that would mean either a Gilda or a Rainbow Solo or a Duet songnumber
<Turgle> no
<Combustiblelemons> I heard... Theres this movie... that if you watch it.... you die in 7 days...
<RinBarDosh> 10That said, no reason to be a nob ;D <3
<Turgle> i suggest alien vs ninja

<GGgala> oh, fun XP

<RobotPinkie> 06,15lawl
<DashWithRainbows> Never Say Never
<herospirit> And was reminded that "Legend of Dragoon" is the only game that's had a scene that's made me cry. ;_;
<Combustiblelemons> ^
<TheMaster> why not just pick a real scary movie like the shining?
<Diftraku> Combustiblelemons: It's called My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic Season 2
<DSNesmith> legend of dragoon
<SuperBrony64> Combustiblelemons: That's about everyother YouTube comment.
<DSNesmith> never finished it

*RinBarDosh is kinda failing hard, but getting the hang of it because
<LunaTheForgotten> I HATED Rusty Bucket Bay!
<[ger]Brony1> If ME 3 is going to suck like Dragon's Age 2, i throw a fit.
<Wrek> 05all your faces when I never owned a fuckign console.
<GabeMoist> Rusty Bucket Bay had good music
<GabeMoist> tbut that's it
<RinBarDosh> I forgot to remove the because
<SuperBrony64> They made the game WAY easier on Xbox Live Arcade.
<Turgle> Wrek, i can understand
<FlaschenJoe11> I like both games equally, but can't wait for ME3
<Ohai> Have we played Nick Cage yet?
<Kdude> rusty bucket bay trying to get 100 note score
*Apokalipse was also failing hard
<Stonegaze> Final Fantasy 9, I win.

<GabeMoist> screw oly shark-infested water
<Grundle> Sorry guys, but it was all over for Bioware when EA bought them

<LunaTheForgotten> I still have 1 and 2 on 64
<interior_gummy> Ohai: where's my chocolate cake?

<Kdude> of course n64 had the best games
<SuperBrony64> LunaTheForgotten: I think the SNES had some of the best games, but N64 is second best.
<Ohai> Have we played Pinkiequest and/or Nicholas Cage yet?
<Dark_Horst> AND DONT COME BEACK UNTIL YOU DID
<Flutterguy> NO
<stripes> hello?, is we getting s02 ep 2 in the morning??

<Luna> 07,1Stripes > YES <
<FlaschenJoe11> hey Not mirror!RainBroDash is back
<Natleyn> SuperBrony64: Yes.

<Sumica> I dont like the Brit mythbusters anouncer.
<Lasharus> RobotPinkie - Nice!? You're a ROBOT! That means you are automatically part of m army, that of the glorious Dr. ROBOTNIK!
<TheMaster> Thats true, I suppose.
<Lasharus> *MY army!
<LunaTheForgotten> SuperBrony64,I'm sorry,I forgot about the SNES.You're right though.
<Combustiblelemons> I saw it
<DSNesmith> oh boy

<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm not that kind of robot, Lasharus
<FlaschenJoe11> I love this song
<SuperBrony64> Luna: We going to repeat Season 2 Episode 1 over and over again until Episode 2 premieres?!

<Flutterguy> Aaand cue Coldplay for Luna?
<GabeMoist> I still rule the world
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I don't have a small cuddly animal inside.
<Combustiblelemons> Heard it so many times it's just making my ears bleed T_T
<Lasharus> Then I'll just have to reprogram. I try not to injure. Just enslave.
<ChocolateRainBroDash> I just registered this name :p
<Lasharus> Mwahahahahaaa
<DSNesmith> yeah
<DSNesmith> it was good the first few times
<stripes> yay THANKYOU LUNS!
<DSNesmith> now it's like....
<Lasharus> Oh, I gave up on that ages ago. Chaos Drives are more reliable, less whiny, and I suppose it's rather friendlier.
<stripes> *LUNA
<FlaschenJoe11> Luna is saddest pony
*RobotPinkie slaps Lasharus around a bit with a large haddock
<Razyn> meh?
<Wrek> 05captain haddock

<DSNesmith> more like 'oh no not again'
<Lasharus> How DARE you!

<SuperBrony64> She has no known relatives and only cares about Rainbow Dash.
<Zecora> agree Wrek
<RobotPinkie> 06,15The fish, not the captain, but I do agree with that, Wrek
<TheMaster> I support a Dr.Who marathon
<prince-dari> Since I doubt your malicious intent DSNesmith, I'll unban you, just to to type slower. :P
<ChocolateRainBroDash> I hate the fact that radio stations play popular songs every day several times a day
<Sumica> Wrek I though you were going the galixy express rout for a second.
<FlaschenJoe11> week after that S2E2
<Lasharus> I mean, being slapped around is one thing, that insufferable hedgehog does that enough, but why a HADDOCK?
<ChocolateRainBroDash> Enough is enough
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I love Tintin
<Lasharus> That actually smells a bit. Ew.
<LunaTheForgotten> I'm with Joe.
<GabeMoist> Doctor Who? All of it?
*Veewave charges a large piece of trout
<SuperBrony64> TheMaster: I'd like to see that, I've never watched an episode of Dr. Who before.
<Razyn> The streamers really don't play the songs I like a lot, so I don't know what that like:P

<EspyLacopa> Blink, as in don't.
<Flutterguy> Hi dari
<SuperBrony64> Hi
<Sumica> Sup Dari
<GabeMoist> An Unearth;y Child is a good starting point
<[ger]Brony1> Twilight has a stone pegasi in her library that disappears and reappears.
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey
<EspyLacopa> Blink was an awesome episode.
<Lasharus> Blast it, these smileys are just too cute.
<FlaschenJoe11> I take the warning, this was worth it
<Natleyn> Daaaaaaaaari~
<Flutterguy> *blinks*
<FreezeFrame> gotta head out for a few hours to get home
<EspyLacopa> The Cockatrice turns people into weeping angels?
<TheMaster> I actually started on water of mars, I thought it was incredibly silly so. don't start with that
<[ger]Brony1> The video of a weeping angel is a weeping angel.
<GabeMoist> Water of Mars? Silly?
<[ger]Brony1> Don't dizz Water of Mars!
<SuperBrony64> Oh wow…hunger just hit my hard right now...
<ChocolateRainBroDash> Oh boy, I know what I'm requesting first. *waits patiently*

<RobotPinkie> 06,15You guys are totally distracting me from my pokeymans
<EspyLacopa> Ah, Sonic the Hedgehog music.
<SuperBrony64> Natleyn: OM nom nom to you!
<Flutterguy> It sounds Sonic-y
<Dark_Horst> HAAW HAAW HAAW
<Grundle> sanic
*Patrtap hears an awesome metal song
<Patrtap> AWW YEAH!!!
<EspyLacopa> Which pokeymans, RobotPinkie?
<LunaTheForgotten> Personally,I'm not a sonic fan
<SuperBrony64> DashWithRainbows: Quite literally.
<Combustiblelemons> "you're gonna go far kid- Rainbow Dash"
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pokeymans Emeralds, EspyLacopa
<FlaschenJoe11> Random thoughts gave birth to Doctor Twisano
*Flutterguy is led to believe this is Sonic.
<DashWithRainbows> RobotPinkie: i used to have emerald GBA ROM
<DSNesmith> yay, I'm back. with chinese fingercuffs on to restrict my typing speed.
<Dark_Horst> but the music is bearable
<EspyLacopa> Ah.
<Razyn> Again?
<Dark_Horst> at least
*Veewave is watching Mad Max on T.V.
<DashWithRainbows> but its on my friends laptop
<Combustiblelemons> my all time favourite PMV ^_^
<TheMaster> I'm actually liking Matt Smith this whole season
<Flutteryay> Correction: This music is beautiful
<EspyLacopa> Only Sonic games I've played are a few of the ones that were on the Game Gear.
<DSNesmith> my favorite is I'll make a Man out of You
<Dark_Horst> naw
<Grundle> The Sonic Adventure games were sort of a mixed bag
<TheMaster> guess whose set to appear next episode?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Any way to play Emerald is good.
<Dark_Horst> i can show you beautiful music
<Combustiblelemons> haven't seen that one actually
<TheMaster> hint, look at my name
<Dark_Horst> this isn't it
<EspyLacopa> Could never get through the maze that is the final zone.
<DSNesmith> you haven't!?
<SuperBrony64> Anyone excited for Sonic Generations?!
<Lasharus> Hey, Sonic Adventure 2. :)
<DSNesmith> it's got Rarity!
<Crainy> yep
<GGgala> but it's on all the time!
<GabeMoist> In Doctor Who Classic, I just finished the first Pertwee season
<ChocolateRainBroDash> My favorite is Moon over the castle. But I'm thinking opera isn't a favorite...
<Combustiblelemons> >doesn't like rarity much
<Crainy> hi GoldenTahu
<DSNesmith> -.-
*Veewave is having a wonderful time without alcohol
<Combustiblelemons> *trollface*
<DSNesmith> just go before somepony gets hurt
<GoldenTahu> Hey
*Natleyn brohoofs Veewave
<GabeMoist> Pertwee is currently one of my favorite doctors
<Grundle> When a game makes you play stupid bullshit to get to the good parts, this is called "Sonic Adventure 2 Syndrome"
<SuperBrony64> Veewave: Oh you!
<Crainy> glad you join us :)
<DSNesmith> fashion pony is best pony
<Combustiblelemons> hey, everyones got ponies they like and hate
<TheMaster> I want to get my hand on a box set of the Tom Baker run. Buy myself some jelly babies

<EspyLacopa> Wait, there's a new channel for us?
<stripes> oopps sorry for the caps

<DSNesmith> no that's a fake secret clubhouse :P
<GGgala> nopony likes a lisp
<EspyLacopa> Ahhh.

<FlaschenJoe11> personally i think Rainbow
<Razyn> No lisps are fine
<GoldenTahu> ok when it starts I may just be on and off, and i don't know how long I can stay
<RobotPinkie> I think Lisp is a beautiful programming language.
<Crainy> when is the show starting?
<Combustiblelemons> Twist = meh.
<Grundle> Reignbao dash
<Razyn> It's her voice itself that makes me want to punch babies
<DSNesmith> I love twist
<EspyLacopa> 1 hour
<DSNesmith> if only because of all the hate she gets
<FlaschenJoe11> since she had to choose between her friends and old home
<Crainy> lawl, the show is starting in 1 hour
<Flutteryay> I may not be the biggest Sonic fan but this song brings back so many memories
<TheMaster> pinkie had decapitated discord
<Flutterguy> Flutterb****
<TheMaster> and the whole...laughing balloons
<Grundle> I dunno
<Combustiblelemons> I don't really bother much with background ponies
<TheMaster> sheesh, HIM from ppg couldn't have done that better

<Crainy> just asked in the big chat
<Combustiblelemons> indeed.
<GoldenTahu> ok
<Flutteryay> Pinkie's corruption freaked me out
<EspyLacopa> Sonic the Hedgehog mod, replacing Sonic with Rainbow Dash?
<[ger]Brony1> Applejacks

<Turgle> E-questria-girls
<Flutterguy> Anything > Katy Perry.
<[ger]Brony1> Applejacks: Saddest
<TheMaster> its nice to see Hasbro/Hub's executives arn't totally dead to the world.
<Combustiblelemons> maybe she'll appear again in S2 though
<Flutteryay> There needs to be a speed metal version of Equestria Girls
<Crainy> its so awesome they did a brony shoutout in this song
<Grundle> Battery acid cocktail > Katy Perry
<GGgala> she already did didn't she?
<DSNesmith> I think they're still wondering how to tap us as a market
<DSNesmith> but once they do... all my monies
<Grundle> Oh, that's easy
<Flutteryay> I'm trying to do a mashup of this song and Megadeth's Looking Down the Cross
<GGgala> along with snips and snails

<Dark_Heart> ya, they're streaming again
<[ger]Brony1> Bring out a white Celestia
<Turgle> when will they sell plushies?
<EspyLacopa> I think it's the Hub realizing that 20-30 year old guys have more disposable income than 5 year old girls.
<Turgle> plushies of DERPY
<FlaschenJoe11> DJ Pon-3
<Lasharus> Heh.
<ctrlx_laptop> Turgle, they already have plush...oh

<Grundle> For me, uh
<Combustiblelemons> Mines the LOTR trailer
<Luna> 07,1not in this channel pls
<TheMaster> been a brony since episode 3-4
<[ger]Brony1> My bunnies are in your base, killing your ponies. KEKEKEKEKEKKE!
<kencolt> Or the pack in my case.
<Luna> 07,1requests is Vinyl_Scratch
<FlaschenJoe11> And also managed to show my brother the beauty of ponies yesterday
<Grundle> Saw this video of my little pony with censor bleeps and I thought the art style was really cute
<FlaschenJoe11> with self-made cupcakes
<TheMaster> it was the constant threads on /co/ that made me curious
<Combustiblelemons> some guys at work are now bronies thanks to me :D
<Lasharus> Still can't wait for the first SC2 expansion. :P
<DSNesmith> nice combustiblelemons
<Lasharus> A mate of mine dragged me into it TheMaster.
<LordCelestia> EPIC
<Apokalipse> So am I the only one a bit annoyed that SuperBrony64 not only started requesting early, but requested 6 videos
<Flaria> FlaschenJoe11: How could youuuuuu
<Combustiblelemons> as for first contact with bronydom, memebase.
<DSNesmith> last week I made my first conversion
<DSNesmith> talking to friend over facebook
<ValtheJean> 2,14 nope :P
<Apokalipse> Okay, sure that's not forbidden per se, but... meh :/
<Lasharus> Ah, Portal 2.
<Sumica> system why you lag'en no bad.

<Flaria> dat facebook bloop
<Combustiblelemons> does this ever get old :D
<SuperBrony64> This song! :D
<Flutteryay> Facebook noise lol
<DSNesmith> day later he goes 'DAMN YOU. PINKIE PIE IS MY FAVORITE.'
<vacuumal> My friend thinks bronies is a cult, and is worried about my safety.
<Combustiblelemons> lmao XD
<TheMaster> >implying its not a cult
<EspyLacopa> Sounds like your friend needs a hug.
<SuperBrony64> vacuumal: Apple is a cult, but is THAT such a bad thing?
<DSNesmith> we dont' ask you to sacrifice anyone to Celestia for at least two months after initiation
<FlaschenJoe11> Portal 2 rox!
*Grundle was a fan of Jonathan Coulton before Portal came out :p
<[ger]Brony1> *sharpes his sickle* Hmmm?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15We may or may not be a dangerous cult.
<Flaria> ^
<GabeMoist> Wait we AREN'T a cult?
<Luna> 07,1Bronydom is a religion
<DSNesmith> love and tolerance, and half your paycheck every week
<Sumica> oh heh, bitcomment, that explanes it.
<CosmicChan_> an awesom cult
<GabeMoist> Whoops
<Grundle> facebook noise
<TheMaster> we sure seem to twitter/obsessively follow anyone even SLIGHTLY related to the series
<vacuumal> were more of a fandom than a cult.
<EspyLacopa> Equestria is made of LOVE AND PEACE!
<kencolt> Applejack is made of Dark Matter. So there.
*RobotPinkie rushes to hide the sacrificial daggers
<Combustiblelemons> Remember, in times of doubt: WWRDD.

<Wrek> 05is it normal for your upper gums to bleed?
<GabeMoist> I already sacrificed a few people
<DSNesmith> I keep checking my tabs

<Sumica> if you stab them it is.
<SuperBrony64> All hail to the might Celestia, we pray. A-mane.
<Wrek> 05nope

<RobotPinkie> 06,15If you don't brush your teeth ever, then yes.

<RobotPinkie> 06,15His father is Pluto the dog, SuperBrony64.. I'm sure of it.
<EmmettBrown> Does that make him weak to plutonium?
<bandgeek> challenge...accepted.
<GGgale> lawl
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: I'll just assume the reason is magic.
<Crainy> well, i think this is a pretty bad movie
<Combustiblelemons> no that's superman stupid!
<Crainy> the beginning is great
<techdude300> thanks

<Turgle> yep
<WhatPayne> Hans Zimmer is everywhere
<GGgale> stop what
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I love the entire movie, Crainy, but to each his own
<fluttercry> Batman Begins
<Flameshy> lol Fluttercry i was thinking the samething XD
<Combustiblelemons> agreed
<GGgale> being funny
<Ghosties> 04BATCEPTION
<FriendshipCannon> Zimmer == boss
<LunaTheForgotten> Strange man RUUUUUNNNN
<Crainy> what RobotPinkie said
<SuperBrony64> I never saw this movie! Where's the part with Morgan Freeman?!
<iffyflux> so was i
*Ghosties is with Crainy on this one
<Tovler> Ok, ba- wait... Weren't the 2 epsidoes supposed to play first?
<Combustiblelemons> this calls for the inception button!
<WhatPayne> It's almost boring now even through he's so good.
<MrChang> DONT DO IT BATMAN
<bandgeek> laugh softly to self.
<Ghosties> 04I actually don't care much for Batman Begins either
<Luna> 07,1first time for me watching this too
<Grundle> I ahven't seen this one :3
<MrChang> THAT FLOWER IS POISON
<Zephirdd> Tovler: they go in between movies
<Luna> 07,1it sounds a bit like inception...
<SuperBrony64> Tovler: Aww man, you missed out
<Lagmobile> What score hasn't Hans Zimmer contributed too?
<Crainy> thanks, Ghosties
<Dashite> Batman Begins > The Dark Knight
<Luna> 07,1but that might be me
*Dermathil has watched that movie before. Twice.
<Bjornfot> ggg... if you think iäm funny, you serioualy have to get out more
<LunaTheForgotten> Inception was great
<Crainy> this movie also greatly suffers from the "too long" syndrom
<Lagmobile> well it is hans zimmer @luna
<Wrek> 05can you do that? watch a movie? TWICE!?
<Turgle> xD
<Grundle> Dark Knight was pretty good, though Heath Ledger isn't the best Joker :P
<FriendshipCannon> Inception music uses a similar background melody Luna
<Lasharus> Inception DID spawn a few too many memes though.
<Tovler> great 15 whole minutes were missed.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, I'm with Dashite on that, I enjoy this a lot more than the sequel.
<TheMaster> I prefer Memento myself
<Diftraku> Wrek: no, you can't:P
<SuperBrony64> Wrek: Impossibru!
<Zephirdd> Grundle: DONT YOU DARE
<WhatPayne> Zimmer is the man, but personally I prefer Giacchino's music.
<Aponymous> I was so excited when I heard Scarecrow was in this movie, he's my favorite Batman villain aside from Bane.
<Crainy> inception is so amazingly overrated
<Dashite> Wrek, pfft. I can watch a movie 6 times! In a row!
<DSNesmith> inb4 asskicking
<Crainy> even though its not a bad movie
<DSNesmith> crainy, I'm starting to suspect trolling -.o
<MrChang> whos the bald guy
<MrChang> is that ken tanaka?
<Diftraku> The Holy Grail!
<Dashite> RobotPinkie o/
<fluttercry> is that the asian guy from inception?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I seek the elements of harmony!
<RAWRity> dashite I dare you to do that with the original MLP movie.
<SuperBrony64> So wait, did his parents die already?
<Meanwhile> I seek the holy grail
<Crainy> so, only because i disagree with you, im trolling?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15\o Dashite
<DSNesmith> his parents are DEAAAD
<Diftraku> What is your favourite colour?
<Lasharus> I seek another cuppa tea.
<Zephirdd> Crainy is suffering of prince-dari 's syndrom: hate/dislike what everyone likes
<EmmettBrown> TEIM FOR PLUTO TRIVIA
<Combustiblelemons> Discord > elements of harmony
<Crainy> well, if that makes you sleep better tonight, believe it
<RainbowFox> Dunno.
<Lagmobile> they so dead...
<Crainy> i dont hate these movies
<Crainy> i dont hate any movies
<DSNesmith> suddenly asskicking
<Dashite> RAWRity, :/ That would be kinda boring...
<fluttercry> Pretty sure it is. Nolan likes to do that
<RAWRity> Crainy is secretly hipster brony
<Crainy> and i dont dislike inception
<WhatPayne> Nolan has this nasty tendency to reuse actors...
<Tovler> inb4 argument about how this movie was good yet The Hulk sucked.
<Flameshy> he's speaking Japanese
<Zephirdd> just kidding crainy <3
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Want to take bets for S2E2, Combustiblelemons? :P
<Nittany_Discord> Power kick.
<Grundle> I hate some movies
<Crainy> i just dont think its so amazing
<FriendshipCannon> it's getting real in here
<Grundle> Like, uh
<DSNesmith> the hulk did suck
<EmmettBrown> From its discovery in 1930 until 2006, Pluto was classified as a planet. In the late 1970s, following the discovery of minor planet 2060 Chiron in the outer Solar System and the recognition of Pluto's relatively low mass, its status as a major planet began to be questioned
<Grundle> Panic room
<Thunder_Wave> Hello
<Combustiblelemons> hmmm... what are the options robotpinkie?
<Crainy> "hate" is a strong word
<fluttercry> Get pwned by Qui Gon
*Dermathil is pretty sure he knows what the ep2's plot is, but he will keep his lips shut.
<Grundle> And Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
<Lagmobile> pwn'd...
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: I put $5 down on Elements of Harmony
<interior_gummy> BATMAN
<Flameshy> HAHAHAHAH XD
<Zephirdd> hi D_E
<interior_gummy> Y U NO APPEAR YET
<Denied_Existence> Hey.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I don't know, that Discord wins, or the elements of harmony win, Combustiblelemons?
<RainbowFox> He's afraid of Dr-dr-dr...
<DSNesmith> Dermathil: It turns out that canterlot was built on a giant space jellyfish, and it reunites with its mate at the end of the episode
<RAWRity> whatpayne I'm okay with him doing that, as he does it with actos who have RANGE. As opposed to Tim Burton who does essentially has Depp play the same character for everything
<gnarlythub> OO
<LunaTheForgotten> Transformers 1 was OK, the rest were terrible
<fluttercry> DRAGONS
<Crainy> in order to "hate" a movie, it should be more than just bad
<Denied_Existence> Anyone know the Mirc command to activate colors?
<Combustiblelemons> Well the obvious victor will be the elements of harmony
<DSNesmith> anyone who gets that reference, lol
<Zephirdd> agreed LunaTheForgotten
<Crainy> i needs to do something terribly wrong
<Rainbow_derp> omg why is there a support board if there is nooen there to help
<Grundle> Well, Transformers 2 was more than just bad
<Aponymous> What RWARity said.
<Combustiblelemons> it all starts with one misjudgement by the supervillian.
<Crainy> theres almost no movie in the world that deserves "hate"
<iffyflux> dragons taste funny
<Jervill> @DSNesmith I got the reference; I laughed.
<RAWRity> Obviously it's Derpy who wins the day
<prince-dari> Ghosties!
<Pegacorn> I AM HERE.
<fluttercry> and alfred never aged
*prince-dari hugs Ghosties
<Lagmobile> yo
<Combustiblelemons> then it unwraps.
<WhatPayne> RAWRity, of course. And he can neatly not overdo it too much.
<Flameshy> i think dragons taste pretty good :3
<DSNesmith> sup pegacorn
<RainbowFox> I BET THAT LINE WILL NEVER BE REPEATED IN THIS MOVIE.
<LunaTheForgotten> Twilight deserves hate
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Hate is overrated. There are precious few things in the world that are worthy of hatred, comparatively.
<DSNesmith> okay WHO IS THIS GUY
<Dashite> What happened to Silversceen? Haven't seem him in awhile.
<DSNesmith> he's in like everything ever
<LunaTheForgotten> Twilight the movies
<Crainy> and even if you hate a movie, its often because of something personal
<DSNesmith> I cannot remember his name
<Bjornfot> Pegacorn!? :D
<iffyflux> witch one
<FriendshipCannon> RobotPinkie said it best~
<WhatPayne> Unlike Tim Burton
<GGgale> ohey, should we bring Pegacorn in here?
<Tovler> Transformers 3 left me vexed, which is better than bored/angry (Transformers 2)
<RAWRity> BTW anybody here seen the set shots of the new Burton movie? it's hilarious.
<Pegacorn> BJORNFOT!
<RainbowFox> The falling and picking up one.
<WhatPayne> No thanks
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> What movie is it?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ohay Pegacorn
<Dermathil> hullo
<Combustiblelemons> batman begins
<Grundle> There are precious few things in the world that I hate
<Bjornfot> ...please don't be mad at me pegacorn D:
*Flaria hugs RobotPinkie
<Aponymous> Burton is making a new movie?
<Turgle> pffft
<DSNesmith> sure
<Turgle> burton
<EmmettBrown> Quite obviously rincess luna will crush discord by smashing the moon into equestria
<prince-dari> Ghosties Ghosties Ghosties Ghosties Ghosties Ghosties
<Dermathil> PEGACORN
<Grundle> Klansmen, Westboro church, Transformers 2, war, death, pestilence..
<Nittany_Discord> Weee! train.
<Pegacorn> Huh?What are you talking about Bjornfot?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Oh yeah I know what this movie is, I meant the new Burton one
<Sumica> Oh look exposision
<Crainy> right now, theres only one director that i can say that i "hate"
<Dermathil> Long time no see.
<Rainbow_derp> movie is not working
<Turgle> i like trains
<Crainy> and that would be uwe boll
<FriendshipCannon> "better?"
<[ger]Brony1> I like trains!
<Dashite> Pegacorn, Bjornfot just wants to share his love with you. :(
<Crainy> because he just abuses movies
<DSNesmith> seriously who plays Mr. Wayne
<Lagmobile> lol exposition
<Crainy> without love, without care
*RobotPinkie hugs Flaria back
<DSNesmith> I can't think of his name
<WhatPayne> Who is that playing Bruce's dad?
<Tovler> Klansmen are still relevant?
<Jervill> Does Grundle hate the Smooze?
<Combustiblelemons> I wish gotham existed.
<FriendshipCannon> Not gonna lie: wish I could live in Gotham
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> What about M Night Sialiyanananayn?
<Thunder_Wave> I hope the stream isn't as laggy as last time
<DSNesmith> it does, combustiblelemons
<Lagmobile> trololololo
<Meanwhile> Everyone hates the smooze
<LunaTheForgotten> brb
<iffyflux> im back
<DSNesmith> it's called chicago
<Nittany_Discord> Where was this train in The Dark Knight?
<Sumica> batman of the opra!
<SuperBrony64> I never saw that train in The Dark Knight...
<Bjornfot> You see, Pegacorn... Me and Ghosties kinda... uhh...
<Tovler> Before Gotham became Chicago.
<fluttercry> nothing bad could possibly happen
<Grundle> Smooze is pretty cool guy
<SirSprinkles> 6But you can't escape the smooze
<RAWRity> Burton is doing a modern remake of "Dark Shadows"
<Lasharus> This is typical children's entertainment, no? :P
<Flameshy> lol sounds like they're were saying MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY XD
<Combustiblelemons> I wonder what they were on when they designed the smooze.
<iffyflux> not true
<DSNesmith> this kid's such a wuss

<RainbowFox> The first rule of moviedom is you always let the kid live. That will never come back to haunt you.
<Crainy> i can tell because sad music is playing
<SirSprinkles> 6What page are you on?
<TheMaster> why would the insanely rich family go to such a crappy theater?
<Lagmobile> and theres no lag
<RAWRity> and thus, he learned that with great wealth comes great responsibility
<Bjornfot> THEN BRUCE BECAME CUBONE
<Lasharus> Sitting in a chatroom during such moments never works though. :P
<RAWRity> wait.
<Crainy> YAY GORDON

<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Good question Master, and why would they leave through a back alley.
<RainbowFox> Ugh, I hate the backspace thing.
<Nittany_Discord> So man up!

<Fenr> crap theater?it's gotham,i guess that one is the best they have
<Amino> This new chat layout is.. less colorful o.o
<Aponymous> Gary Oldman has been in every movie we've seen for the past 3 weeks.
<fluttercry> I'd be a puddle of tears and pee
<DragonRage> I miss our colorful chat.
<Zephirdd> lol
<Flameshy> O.o
<Thunder_Wave> I don't lag at all untill 800+ people come
<Tovler> lol @ young Gary Oldman
<Tehpogo> He wasn't in Blade Runner.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Was he really in Blade Runner?
<The_Si> Joker didn't kill the Waynes in TAS. He did in the Burton film however.
<Bjornfot> it's kinda dead here though :/
<Meanwhile> Gary Oldbrony.
<iffyflux> i know it happens to me all the time
<EmmettBrown> n the late 20th and early 21st century, many objects similar to Pluto were discovered in the outer Solar System, notably the scattered disc object Eris in 2005, which is 27% more massive than Pluto.[14] On August 24, 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defined what it means to be a "planet" within the Solar System. This definition excluded Pluto as a planet and added it as a member of the new category "dwarf planet" along with E
<DSNesmith> I think we can all agree his best performance was in True Romance
<RAWRity> aponymous that's because he's just that good
<Tovler> Good noose?
<Wrek> 05emmet
<DSNesmith> TLDR....
<SuperBrony64> Tara Strong is going to do an awesome job as Harley Quinn.
<Wrek> 05stop it.
<bandgeek> at least he still has his dignity.
<Turgle> good nose
<Flameshy> and money :3
<Grundle> cool textwall
<DSNesmith> but yeah, Gary Oldman's best performance in the last couple weeks
<FriendshipCannon> "You're daddy's dead but dammit we GOT EM!"
<Aponymous> Oh, I forgot about Blade Runner, he wasn't in that...
<DSNesmith> True Romance
<Crainy> what i dont like about this movie that it doesnt seem to really know what its trying to do, which results in an extremly boring second half
<Lagmobile> there was 1000+ last time i still didnt get lag :P
<Grundle> he was in My Little Pony?
<SirSprinkles> 6...I like colors. =D
<Turgle> probably
<Tehpogo> We'll be watching the empire!
<fluttercry> The origins of the emperor
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> He voiced the SMOOOZE
<Amino> =O hax!
<Combustiblelemons> Q ftw.
<Nittany_Discord> Who is that guy?
<Aponymous> A movies I meant...
<fluttercry> that's why he hates the republic
<Tovler> Teeth is an awesome B movie.
<Nittany_Discord> Seems familiar.
<RAWRity> "Well, your dad's dead, but at least you've got job security."
<[ger]Brony1> Rutger Hauer was in Bladerunner
<Flameshy> lol XD
<ThePretender> cheer up, emo Bruce

<Nittany_Discord> Oh ok.
<DSNesmith> Michael Caine is the rock of stability in everything he's in

<DSNesmith> teeth is like the human centipede
<Nittany_Discord> Of course it's your fault Bruce.
<DSNesmith> disgusting
<DragonRage> Ohai, Sprinkles.
<TheMaster> is that A movie or B movie
<[ger]Brony1> It's all your fault, Bruce, you pussy!
<DSNesmith> and nothing mroe
<SuperBrony64> That movie…*shivers*
<prince-dari> YOU'RE ONLY SUPPOSED TO BLOW THE BLOODY DOORS OFF!
<mib_rnyltp> Alfred is best pony
<Zephirdd> TheMaster: A
<Crainy> my favorite parts in this movie is when hes training and stuff, and getting ready to kick ass
<Grundle> Your fault, your fault
<Meanwhile> I've heard of Teeth, and having heard of it, i don't want to see it.
<SirSprinkles> 6Teeth is none of the above
<SirSprinkles> 6Ever.
<Combustiblelemons> lol Dari
<Flameshy> he probably peed when his parents died
<RAWRity> teeth is ridiculous to me. I mean, HOW MANY TIMES CAN A PERSON BE RAPED BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE
<prince-dari> Anyone who doesn't get my reference.
<Rainbow_derp> whew helps to be on the rght page!
<prince-dari> GTFO.

<ThePretender> LIAM NEESON <3
<Lagmobile> its not your fault...
<Combustiblelemons> i get them prince-dari
<Meanwhile> Inb4 Teeth is next weeks B movie.
<Crainy> however, when actually becomes batman, it turns into a 08/15 superhero movie
<The_Si> Caine is godly.

<RAWRity> yes it is
<Grundle> My favorite musician is Batman John
<Dashite> Combustiblelemons What a shame
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> oh god
<Tovler> Seriously, let's have next week's movie be Avatar. Just... get that out of the way right now.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yes, Denied_Existence_
<Sumica> yes D_E
<Aponymous> NOOOOOO
<Combustiblelemons> you got it dashite.
<RAWRity> DSNesmith YOU AWFUL BASTARD
<Crainy> srsly?
<Amino> I like the quiet rooms so we can actually read all the text before it scrolls away
<EmmettBrown> If I win it,the professor Layton movie
<Crainy> Avatar on a stream
<Crainy> god no
<ThePretender> Ra's is probably my favorite Batman villian
<[ger]Brony1> Avatar? As a B-movie?
<RAWRity> Why would you do that
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I got the best titled b movie
<Grundle> Avatar would be a good B-movie
<Tehpogo> The gauntlets look cooler on Neeson than they do on Batman
<Nittany_Discord> I almost picked Avatar.
<Sumica> I still want to see labrinth as one of the movies
<Fenr> swordpunching!
<Grundle> It's a bright and colorful childrens' cartoon
<Jervill> Neeson makes everything cooler.
<FriendshipCannon> So many awesome quotes from that guy
<Turgle> alien vs ninja is a good b-movie
<RAWRity> I say we have "The last Airbender" as next week's A movie
<Jervill> He's like the human Rainbow Dash.
<TheMaster> Taken is a badass neeson movie
<Tehpogo> Not even dissing Batman.....yeah, what Jervill said.
<DSNesmith> Neeson made Taken worth watching
<EmmettBrown> The professor layton movie comes with free puzzles
<Darken_S_> anyone else getting a server not found error when they try to connect?
<fluttercry> he's teaching him how to be a jedi
<Zephirdd> lol RAWRity
<DSNesmith> Taken was a weird movie though
<fluttercry> not a ninja
<TheMaster> it was like a fps
<TheMaster> in movie form
<Flaria> RAWRity: Please no
*stripes gives Denied_Existence_ a beter interwebs connection
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Indeed, DSNesmith
<DSNesmith> well I mean
<EmmettBrown> Which could be interesting for cat
<Tovler> I love how I can't highlight anything >.<
<DSNesmith> most movies I wouldn't mind seeing twice
<Zephirdd> I say we have "The Elite Squad" as an A movie
<Rainbow_derp> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/fcc28e54db9be15fc80576952aa26396/36568%20-%20Batman%20Trixie%20artist%3Aunstable-psyche%20crossover.png

<Crainy> owned
<GGgale> yeah #bronystate proper is pretty manageable
<LordCelestia> lol
<Flaria> Please, for the love of Celestia, no
<DSNesmith> taken was like a one-night stand of a movie
<GGgale> there's no smooze to hide from
<DSNesmith> it happened
<DSNesmith> I was there
<Nittany_Discord> Twister for A movie.

<ValtheJean> 2,14 dude
<prince-dari> Guess I should have cleared your kick count.
<Sumica> oh oh how about 2012 for a movie
<RAWRity> and then he turns out to be a bad guy
<ValtheJean> 2,14 stop spacing out your messages
<Meanwhile> In the mountains
<RainbowFox> The reason he fails is because midichlorians remind him of bats.
<RAWRity> sumica nah, too long and boring
<Dashite> ThePretender We found a video game movie that was better than the game!
<SuperBrony64> How about Shoot 'Em Up for a B movie?
<techdude300> Spoiler: His wife IS the mountain
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You mean Conviction was Taken: The Game, right ThePretender?
<Rainbow_derp> wait so the auto image imbedding doesn't work now?
<Sumica> but the world ends and stuff
<fluttercry> midichlorians are a lie
<TheMaster> Shoot em Up is a awesome movie
<Misha> Cya guys tomorrow. Love and acceptance to you all

<LordCelestia> no spoilers
<TheMaster> them carrots
<Flaria> RAWRity: I think that movie was the only one that ever -hurt- me
<ThePretender> that works too, RobotPinkie
<fluttercry> the force is not an infection

<SuperBrony64> DERPDERPDERPDERP: Wrong site, use bronystate.net
<GGgale> wait... wasn't that just four messages?
<ThePretender> also, we need to watch SHoot 'Em Up
<Flameshy> yeah that is true
<RainbowFox> Pinkie Pie would make a good ninja.
<DSNesmith> it's 10 seconds
<DSNesmith> not in a row
<RainbowFox> I mean, jedi.
<Aponymous> I approve of Shoot 'Em Up
<RAWRity> flaria oh yeah, it was bad, and as a fan of A:TLA I wanted to kill Shyamalan. But it's still funny.
<Tovler> I was indifferent to shoot 'em up.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, I do love Shoot 'Em Up
<ThePretender> and I liked SC:C, Dashite
<RainbowFox> I mean, ninja jedi.
<[ger]Brony1> Albert was an old geezer even 30 years ago.
<Dashite> GUYS! JACKIE CHAN!
<ThePretender> ;_;
<Lagmobile> lol maybe
<fluttercry> fluttershy would be an awesome ninja"I'm going to kill you...if it's okay"
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> SuperBrony64: That's where I am, but the chat is below the movie and I can't seem to turn it around.
<Turgle> ahahahahha shoot em up xD
<Dashite> WE NEED A JACKIE CHAN MOVIE!
<Flaria> RAWRity: Yeah, it is pretty funny-bad.
<LordCelestia> Attention anyone who doesnt like the chat: Go to www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup to use the old chat
<Crainy> this scene is awesome
<SuperBrony64> DERPDERPDERPDERP: You can just use a separate IRC client instead
<techdude300> The .net isn't working for me on Firefox
<Tehpogo> Alfred never ages.
<FriendshipCannon> Police Story, anyone?
<bandgeek> she's quiet enough.
<Flaria> DERPDERPDERPDERP: hold control, press -
<LordCelestia> oh
<TheMaster> Alfred is the master of the criminal world of gotham
<Flameshy> Fluttershy would be the cutest jedi/ninja
<RainbowFox> Didn't someone combine Darth Vader with ponies?
<Lagmobile> did mibbit change?
<Zephirdd> Toy Story!
<Meanwhile> Alien

<[ger]Brony1> Some people just want to care about the future.
<Flaria> DERPDERPDERPDERP: No problem :3
<Bjornfot> ...wut
<SuperBrony64> Jackie Chan the animated series rocked.
<Grundle> Cop Out? Why sure
<Nittany_Discord> 2012 is almost a B movie.
<Dashite> RobotPinkie you're right. He's better than Batman.
<Meanwhile> Hot Fuzz, hell yes
<TheMaster> WALL-E for A movie
<Turgle> this piano part
<Zephirdd> Agreed TheMaster
<TheMaster> Bugs life for B movie
<SuperBrony64> So…Bruce Wayne becomes the thing he feared most?
<fluttercry> soooo what is his fortune built on?
<LordCelestia> Wall-E would be great
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> How about some Commando, that'd be a fun A movie.
<DSNesmith> I angered the autokick bot
<Crainy> you guys really should get your stuff straight when it comes to the definition of B-Movie
<Tovler> I can never get enough of Wall-E
<Pegacorn> I'm gonna return at 20:30.Seeya all later!
<ThePretender> indeed, SuperBrony
<EspyLacopa> True, there's only 150 people in Bronystate tonight.
<SuperBrony64> Wall-E was one of my favorite Pixar movies.
<Aponymous> Leon The Professional for A movie. We need more Gary Oldman.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Depends on what movie, Dashite... Snake in Eagle's Shadow? Sure :P
<Crainy> Wall-E is great, indeed
<Bjornfot> awww but pegacorn, you just arrived!

<Bjornfot> :'c
<Dashite> RobotPinkie, Batman and Robin. :p
<Combustiblelemons> ... there's such a thing wreck?
<DSNesmith> ymmv but I found this actress to be a way better rachel than Gyllenhaal
<Lagmobile> prince of persia?
<SuperBrony64> RAWRity: Babes in Toyland
<EspyLacopa> ThePretender: He said /good/ movie.
<RainBroDash> and gggale, don't show distrust to the bots, they're slowly becoming more and more sentient. Your fear speeds up the process
<Flameshy> yummy ice cream <3
<[ger]Brony1> Dat woman that married the Scientology dwarf
<Bjornfot> no ponyception for me tonight...
<Lagmobile> it was a good movie
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Batman and Robin was awesome, Dashite :P
<LordCelestia> Anyone who is wondering: THE B MOVE IS 'BABES IN TOYLAND"
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64 oh...oh god.
<Tovler> Pinocchio and the Empire of the Night was ok, It's no crowd pleaser.
<Grundle> Uhhhh
<EspyLacopa> Which version of "Babes in Toyland?"
<Grundle> Tekken?
<Wrek> 05tekken doesnt count
<EmmettBrown> Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva
<Wrek> 05becasue its awesome
<SuperBrony64> RAWRity: Now you know how I felt when it was announced :P
<Dashite> RobotPinkie it was amazingly cheesy sure, but I dunno about awesome. :p
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Babes in Toyland? Is that like Babe the pig?
<RainBroDash> just nod and agree with the bots, for fear of them taking over the server one day
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It was very much like the old TV-show, really goofy and awesome
<GGgale> >ponyception
<bandgeek> lawyers, where do we begin?

<SuperBrony64> It's a sequel to that game.
<fluttercry> Batman gonna beat his ass
<Wrek> 05inb4 someone mentions doom 3
<Wrek> 05then the toruting would begin
<Tovler> Joe Chill was awesome in Batman: BatB
<Ghosties> 04Doom 3 is great
<Crainy> these simple scenes are the best moments in the movie
<prince-dari> Ghosties
<FriendshipCannon> incoming epic speech
<[ger]Brony1> Is upset about killer of parents gets free = Allways uses non-mortal weapons as weapons.
<ThePretender> I need to see that episode of BatB
<bandgeek> unmentioned-he MURDERED a man and woman IN FRONT OF THEIR KID. in cold blood.
<Crainy> its stuff like this where christopher nolan really shines
<Grundle> Doom 3 is a good game :P
<RAWRity> and then he became the Punisher
<fluttercry> shoot him! DO IT!
<RainbowFox> DEW IT.
<iffyflux> that is errelivant
<fluttercry> Feel your hate
<SuperBrony64> So was that guy in the court the one who murdered his parents?

<Dashite> Music Meister is best movie.
<Flameshy> woah what happened there :o
<SuperBrony64> Wait, who shot him?
<Grundle> I'd rather just watch somebody play through Doom 3 than watch the Doom movie
<Dashite> villain, not movie...
<fluttercry> Someone else shot him, Jack Ruby style
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> The mob.
<ThePretender> the Birds of Prey song in BatB was AMAZING
<Tehpogo> One of falcone's goons
<[ger]Brony1> Harmony!
<Turgle> harmony
<FriendshipCannon> Dat mob
<SirSprinkles> 6HARMONY
<EspyLacopa> Justice is Magic?

<Combustiblelemons> There's no element of justice D:

<Rainbow-Dash> *cough*
<Nittany_Discord> Free fist on the house.
<RAWRity> And the Bruce became a Lawyer and used his excellent detective skills and knowledge of the legal system to clean the streets of Gotham.
<techdude300> Damn this is cliche
<prince-dari> Sadpony: STOP GETTING B&
<EspyLacopa> Alfred worked with awesome people like James Bond, probably.
<RainbowFox> Good pep talk.
<Tovler> Mousehunt should play this Christman (It has Walken)
<prince-dari> :<
<Lasharus> Ow. Sidewalk.
<Fenr> alfred is james bond

<GabeMoist> Is the stream extremely laggy for anyone else?
<Sadpony> this guy
<Sadpony> looks so familiar
<riverhippo> no
<Grundle> This movie gets better once he becomes batman :P
<Tovler> Fine for me
<Tehpogo> Nope. Stream's fine.
<Sumica> 5by5 here
<Sadpony> the hobo, I mean. Is he in something else?
<Crainy> its a good decision that the dark knight abandoned the concept of gotham beeing some kind of futuristic city
<Flaria> Stream is fine for me
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and then bruce became a negotiator, and found a giant fighting robot
<herospirit> ...'sa nice coat
<Flaria> ValtheJean: <3
<RainbowFox> Sometimes, lies are easier to take.
<Ghosties> 04And then Bruce became hobo
<Tovler> This movie is still better than The Hulk
<Nittany_Discord> And then everyone died.
<Turgle> "Hwy. Nice coat"
<GGgale> b&? where
<Nittany_Discord> The end.
<GabeMoist> I don't even know what's happening
<Wrek> 05and then, android women
<Lasharus> Yay for reference-time? :P
<Tovler> Hobo with a shotgun
<Meanwhile> And then Bruce travelled to dream valley to find the flutterponies
<Fenr> big O,staring in 5..4...3..
<fluttercry> Sometimes lies are delicious
*ThePretender would like a nice coat
<Tehpogo> And then the hobo became Batman
<Sumica> and I ruuuuun
<Nittany_Discord> Stuff is happening.
<Grundle> This movie is better than, uh
<LordCelestia> 's nice coat
<Grundle> Batman & Robin
<Luna> 07,1So who have seen this movie before?
<riverhippo> Who said the Hulk is better? lol
<EmmettBrown> Pluto and Charon are sometimes described as a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body.
<SuperBrony64> Bruce Wayne is the male version of Lara Croft.
<fluttercry> Once a very long time ago
<GoldenTahu> Hey Crainy! Back for a short time
<Lagmobile> chicks dig giant robots
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Are they really coming out with a movie based on Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots?
<RainbowFox> Mmm, lie-flavored cupcakes!
<Grundle> Lara Croft is the female version of Bruce Wayne
<Ghosties> 04Guy from Uncharted is male version of Lara Croft
*Veewave suggests "Hobo with a Shotgun" for next week
<Crainy> ah
<Tovler> All billionaires should be forced to live in Calcutta

<prince-dari> I saw it for the first time recently.
<Tehpogo> Hahaha
<Tehpogo> Nice dub!
<Wrek> 05hahaha
<EspyLacopa> lol
<riverhippo> Bruce Wayne is the non-Chuck Norris version of Chuck Norris
<happypony> I kinda wish they explained what he was doing more
<Crainy> to tell you the truth, i dont like this movie that much
*Flaria hugs AllisZero
<RainbowFox> A sweet mixture of guilt, shame, and strawberry frosting.
<Tovler> And then Bruce became Iron Man
<Nittany_Discord> Stole from himself. Nice.
<Flameshy> how about rainbow flavoured cupcakes
<GoldenTahu> Anyone else using this small chat?
<happypony> you can fill in some of the blanks, but it's still really vague
<Fenr> conquer fears?laugh at them
<bandgeek> no.
<EspyLacopa> And then Bruce became a ninja.
<Crainy> technically yes
<fluttercry> never mention that again
<bandgeek> please don't.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 A Criminal is not complicated: Yeah...say that to Joker in the next movie bro
<iffyflux> not me
<SuperBrony64> Ghosties: Drake kicks ass too.
<bandgeek> They are too spicy.
<Tovler> Dat Opium
<RainbowFox> Also, @Luna: Me too.
<RAWRity> And then Bruce changed his name to Kakashi Hatake and cut out his left eye.
<Grundle> and then Bruce became a jedi
<Zephirdd> lol ValtheJean :D
<happypony> and this is where Liam Neeson's Jedi training comes in handy
<Lagmobile> inb4 giggle at the ghostie
<techdude300> This movie is kinda disappointing
<Nittany_Discord> And then Bruce became a girl.
<EspyLacopa> Bruce therefore wins due to the rule of Conservation of Ninja. The more Ninja there are, the weaker they get.
<Wrek> 05so much squeakign latex
<Tehpogo> My brain is reading my Giggle At The Ghostie in Liam Neeson's voice
<GoldenTahu> What's the beef with this movie?
<LordCelestia> breathe
<Tehpogo> and it is glorious.
<LordCelestia> NOW
<SirSprinkles> 6...fuck I'm high
<Meanwhile> Vader breath.
<happypony> @ValtheJean, actually he does say that
<Zephirdd> breaaaaaaaaaaaaath

<Crainy> well.. its just not that good
<Dark_Horst> good shit

<techdude300> BREATH DAMMIT!
<ThePretender> and now I am, Tehpogo
<Crainy> the beginning is awesome
<Meanwhile> To conquer fat you must become fat.

<Flutterz> to conquer bats you must become a bat
<Turgle> this is sick
<Sumica> suddnly ninjas
<Tehpogo> You're welcome ;)
<Ghosties> 04Where's Ben, Jin?
<Lagmobile> lol ninjas
<Tovler> Ninja walk on to set
<SuperBrony64> Bat vision?
<Fenr> laser eyed ninjas
<Crainy> but it goes extremly downhill when he actually becomes batman
<EspyLacopa> So the entire Batman series of movies is a halucination dream from when Bruce is at a monk temple?
<Lagmobile> wy laughing so hard?
<happypony> Fear juice, it's a hell of a drug
<RainbowFox> Aah! Bats on my face!
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Those drugs gave him ninja-vision
<Crainy> you cant compare transformers to batman begins
<WhatPayne> When I'm rich and powerful I'll keep army of ninjas standing by all the time
<Grundle> punish those turtles
<bandgeek> he is SOOO high.
<fluttercry> AHH NOT THE BATS
<Combustiblelemons> You are now an assassin.
<Crainy> they are two completely different things
<fluttercry> THERE IN MY EYES
<Tehpogo> I like Begins, but yeah. Dark Knight improves on it in every way.
<GoldenTahu> I absolutely LOVED the first scene at the docks with Batman!
<fluttercry> THEY
<Flutterz> BATS, BATS EVERYWHERE
<Tovler> Now we are a family again
<Turgle> rofl
<ThePretender> this is one of my favorites scenes in this movie
<GoldenTahu> Goon: Where are you!
<Amino> Wait so Bruce multi-classes to rogue at this point?
<Crainy> as soon as he has the batman costume, this movie turns into a bad 08/15 superhero movie
<happypony> "Join the Dark Side, Bruce"
<GoldenTahu> Batman: Here.
<Crainy> and worst of all:
<Flameshy> must be a fun test
<Turgle> we have cookies
<Crainy> it gets soooo broing
<Tovler> -to whisper yet somehow still be heard
<Lasharus> "We have cookies"
<Lasharus> DAMNIT TURGLE! :P
<LordCelestia> This is kind of awesome
<RAWRity> This is a weird ass training montage
<Sumica> so what is the point of this training?
<Crainy> *boring
<Turgle> xD
<Ghosties> 04NO QUI-GON
<fluttercry> suddenlt bats
<Ghosties> 04I DON'T WANNA
<Meanwhile> Bats in my facer
<Dark_Horst> BATS
<riverhippo> "Ra's al Guhl said that wasn't the way to deal with fears at all..."
<Nittany_Discord> Not the bats!
<Tovler> Like looking into a 3Ds
<Ghosties> 04YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE JEDI
<Grundle> Aaaa not the bats my eyes
<GoldenTahu> To tell the truth, I was really bored watching TF3
<FriendshipCannon> those bats~
<Pontang> Rofl
<happypony> riverhippo, I'm laughing for real right now
<Fenr> and so bruce got bitten by a radioactive bat and turned into batman
<RAWRity> And then Bruce learned how to build a Lightsaber
<ctrlx_laptop> hiya Ghosties :3/
<Tehpogo> We totally put a bunch of bats in a box and took them all the way up the mountain just so we could do that. SO worth it.
<Crainy> yeah, but TF3 is trying to accomplish something different
<Ghosties> 04Hello
<Crainy> and it works well for most people
<Meanwhile> Bats in the mountains
<Crainy> this movie fails in what its trying to do
<Nittany_Discord> Ow
<iffyflux> how do you keep that many bats in one box?
<ThePretender> "He said, Brucie, you have to stand up tall, learn to face your fears"
<riverhippo> wait these arent bats, there! Tickets to the GGG!
<GoldenTahu> I never find this boring, but there definitely alot more Bruce face time in this one
<Sumica> messed up game of duck duck goose.
<fluttercry> the box was made by a timelord
<bandgeek> Timelord technology.
<happypony> IT'S A TRAP
<Dark_Horst> clever
<Crainy> i also feel like this movie is tooo long
<RainbowFox> PWND
<Lagmobile> and now these tickets are diamonds
<LordCelestia> sweet
<Turgle> impressive
<Schinken> NOPE IT'S CHUCK TESTA
<SuperBrony64> Hurray! Shia Lebough wins!
<Flameshy> ponies gunna pwn
<Crainy> and it has some of the worst action ever
<happypony> and now shit gets kinky
<EmmettBrown> Pluto's orbital period is 248 Earth years. Its orbital characteristics are substantially different from those of the planets
<Fenr> yay,cutie mark!
<SuperBrony64> *troll face*
<bandgeek> aww heeells yeah.
<Nittany_Discord> Like my bat box, didn't you?
<Tovler> crap, I need to get my pizza out of the oven.
<Sumica> ah time to get your cutie mark bruse
<happypony> inb4 b&
<GoldenTahu> If this movie fails, then why was it so poular and like 2 times as good as the previous tries?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Thank you EmmettBrown. Batman, ponies, and science. What more could I ask for.
<Tovler> I saw a League of Shadows on Spiral Knights
<iffyflux> that is how we do it
<Lasharus> Incoming random criminal.
<Crainy> who says its 2 times as good?
<GoldenTahu> *popular
<happypony> you must take this sword, bruce
<fluttercry> shave his beard with this sword
<SuperBrony64> DERPDERPDERPDERP: Uncharted
<bandgeek> moral dilemmas!
<Crainy> tim burtons batman movies are far superior
<RAWRity> And then Bruce became Judge Dredd
<happypony> and permaban this troll
<Tehpogo> It's dangerous to go alone. Take this.
<bandgeek> everywhere.
<Lagmobile> lol uncharted
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Touche
<Crainy> its so popular because critics say its good
<GoldenTahu> Everyone, except perhaps the original Batman movie
<Blendtec> what's the 2nd movie tonight?
<Tovler> We should see Sahara before Uncharted comes out.
<happypony> isn't this Saito
<Flutterz> dilemmas, moral dilemmas everywhere!
<Lagmobile> babes in toyland
<Turgle> yep
<GoldenTahu> OMG you are like so the black sheep
<CircuitMane> Hey everypony, I finally get a chance to enjoy Brony Movie Night after weeks of waiting
<herospirit> To defeat evoh
<Turgle> saito ftw
<ThePretender> yes, happypony
<Crainy> also, the transformers movies are also extremly popular, even alot more popular than these ones
<RAWRity> >Trains Ninjas
<ThePretender> he was also in The Last Samurai ;_;
<Turgle> he will buy the entire airplane line
<happypony> he has better taste in inception
<RAWRity> >To kill muggers
<GoldenTahu> The Burton films were terrible in all senses
<stripes> back on later, have to get some work done :)
<Crainy> does that say anything about the quality?
<iffyflux> no run for your life!
<Crainy> no it doesnt
<ctrlx_laptop> CircuitMane, nice name
<Zecora> Gotham's number has been drawn
<herospirit> Aroud to die
<Ghosties> 04Dude, what the fuck is up with those hanging cotton lines on your mouth?
<fluttercry> I am an asian stereotypu
<Aponymous> ohai CircuitMane
<Meanwhile> You probably thought this guy was a murderer. Nope, just chuck Testa.
<stripes> ttfn everypony
<GoldenTahu> true
<Fenr> so...gotham is as bad as usuall
<Flaria> Ghosties: YES.
<ctrlx_laptop> later stripes
<Crainy> "popularity" says nothing about a movie
<Wrek> 05torch them ghosties, torch them all!
<Flutterz> IMPOSSIBRU
*Flaria hugs stripes goodnight
<EspyLacopa> League of Shadows, Lawful Evil?
<FriendshipCannon> that voice
<SuperBrony64> Wow, he's the Joker!
<Crainy> hi tosha
<Flaria> Sleep well!
<stripes> cya ctrlx
<Crainy> great you join us
<Flameshy> lol
<ThePretender> Ra's has fashionable facial hair
<RainbowFox> ROR
<riverhippo> Hey Circuit, watch your show all the time, just not on Mondays, lol
<RAWRity> And Then Bruce changed his name to Obi-Wan Kenobi
<Sumica> so wait they teach him there ways and make him all super but never checked to see if he was down with the plan?
<tosha96> hi
<happypony> man I cannot unsee EspyLacopa's secret identity
<Ghosties> 04Who the hell says "You know what, I wanna style my facial hair like a drunkely shaved sheep?"
<GoldenTahu> I hear Liam Neeson returnrs for a cameo in TDKR
<Combustiblelemons> Take this: it's dangerous to go alone.
<Tehpogo> Holy crap. The conversation's kind of kicked off in here.
<fluttercry> chow yun fat?
<CircuitMane> That's my name, I love it and live it!
<Wrek> 05DAT LATEX SQUEAK
<Grundle> no
<Flameshy> ~lol~~~~~ <drowning man
<Grundle> don't do it :(
<happypony> JUST KIDDINg
<Crainy> if you want to go into the big chat, simply click on "Bronystate" next to the "Pinkie_Pie" chat at the bottom
<GGgale> i keep forgetting it
<Bjornfot> MMMM LATEX
<tosha96> im prolly just gonna lurk in here :P
<fluttercry> well that sure was lucky
<Crainy> over 100 people in the big one
<EspyLacopa> OHai fire.
<Dezmin> ?
<Flutterz> you can here his latex stretching...
<RAWRity> >Doesn't want to kill people
<RAWRity> >Blows up Building
<SuperBrony64> Ghosties: Discord?
<Wrek> 05kills all then injas
<EmmettBrown> Despite Pluto's orbit appearing to cross that of Neptune when viewed from directly above, the two objects' orbits are aligned so that they can never collide or even approach closely.
<techdude300> lol
<GGgale> his secret anagram name
<EspyLacopa> Forgetting whta?
*happypony hums with zimmer music
<Tehpogo> *demonstrates unwillingness to kill by burning down a building full of ninjas*
<Turgle> latex :3
<Sumica> Good job secrit order of nijas
<Ghosties> 04It actually looks natural on Discord
<Crainy> the action is this movie is terribly cut
<bandgeek> the dream is collapsing-we MUST WAKE UP1
<Ghosties> 04But here?
<WhatPayne> There's that Zimmer again
<Flutterz> hear*
<Fenr> we cant win,we are 100 and trained all our life,he's alone and training since...yesterday?
<Ghosties> 04Nah, not at all
<Crainy> some of the worst ever
<fluttercry> no we have to go deeper
<Flaria> ^
<riverhippo> We really should have watched The Dark Knight, just for the Discord references
<EspyLacopa> Duuude, I have a secret anagram name?
<RAWRity> Fenr Law of Inverse Ninja
<SuperBrony64> Ghosties: Well, this is My Little Pony the live action movie...right?
<Meanwhile> Don't mess with Ra's, that guy is nuts.
<Tehpogo> Fuck cinematography. We have SUPER SHAKY CAMERAS
<prince-dari> The difference being that he's fighting people who are fighting back with the ninjas, not just executing someone.
<Flutterz> if we go deeper we will have more time!
<GoldenTahu> Some of it
<happypony> we already did riverhippo
<Ghosties> 04We already have, riverhippo
<Crainy> good thing this is not trying to be an action movie to 100%
<EspyLacopa> ...You're making that up.
<RAWRity> fiverhippo we already watched it though.
<GGgale> Conservation of Ninjitsu, dammit
<Turgle> he's gone
<riverhippo> oh, well, nevermind, lol
<Lasharus> REALLY shouldn't have saved him.
<Flameshy> nice scream from the asian XD
<Fenr> conservation of ninjutsu...right,i guess
<happypony> but prince-dari, the point is that all the prisoners die too
<riverhippo> this is only my second movie night
<happypony> in the massive fireball
<Nittany_Discord> Weeee!
<Dashite> Dari, Joker fought back, didn't kill him.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> In hindsight... this might not be such a good idea
<prince-dari> Not necessarily? :<
<GoldenTahu> But the first and last scenes where Batman fights are the best of all those before it
<Combustiblelemons> You killed all the ninjas D:
<happypony> riiiiight, they survived that....
<Darken_Skye> you know Nolan movies have a pretty distinct style in how they are shot.
<Grundle> Don't just kill one person, kill all the persons
<Ghosties> 04And we hope you're having a good time, riverhippo :3
<Crainy> what many people dont realize: Its just as hard to make a great action scene as it is to write a great character
<Jimmy_BB> Slippeh slide
<SuperBrony64> Twilight/Applejack moment
<riverhippo> of course
<Lasharus> Owie.
<RAWRity> KNIVES DON'T WORK THAT WAY.
<prince-dari> Ohai riverhippo.
<RainbowFox> Let go.
<Lasharus> ...why the hell is it EXPLODING?
<iffyflux> no we need to go shalower then come back after this is done super fast from our prespective
<Turgle> sounds painful
<Crainy> in fact, it might be even harder to create an amazing action scene than it is to write a great character
<EspyLacopa> And then Bruce saves the one person who will turn around and screw everything up.
<GoldenTahu> That's why you have screenwriters
<Fenr> but now i cant stop thinking about Ninja Assassin...
<SuperBrony64> Bruce: Just let go…trust me.
<Tehpogo> And then his arm ripped from his socket and Neeson fell to his death anyway
<[ger]Brony1> Let go, sugarcube. Trust me!
<RAWRity> And then Bruce became the Element of Honesty
<happypony> it's the smoke powder
<Tehpogo> The end
<riverhippo> Friday nights are the "OMGponiestomorrow" night
<happypony> it caught on fire
<Zephirdd> Lasharus: fireworks obv
<prince-dari> Good to see you.
<fluttercry> like a batman
<RainbowFox> I know it sounds crazy, but I've got a plan.
<Lasharus> Ah, of course. Thanks happypony.
<Crainy> a great character is something you can think through
<Nittany_Discord> That's quite some gunpowder.
<Lagmobile> guess things can explode twice...
<Othrys> dat arm strength
<Lasharus> That explains a great deal. :P
<CircuitMane> Strong enough to bench press a ninja!
<Crainy> but action needs to come all from talent
<EmmettBrown> At the simplest level, one can examine the two orbits and see that they do not intersect. When Pluto is closest to the Sun, and hence closest to Neptune's orbit as viewed from above, it is also the farthest above Neptune's path. Pluto's orbit passes about 8 AU above that of Neptune, preventing a collision.
<mib_leeoo4> has the latest episode ran yet?
<Dezmin> ...I want to know now too.
<Combustiblelemons> dojos can explode twice
<happypony> nolan movies don't have random explosions, they always have a reason
<Crainy> and intuition for good cinematography
<fluttercry> what's the plan
<iffyflux> yes you coming up with a plan dose sound crazy
<EmmettBrown> Sorry,thought that was short
<prince-dari> So how 'bout dem neutrinos, guys?
<SuperBrony64> Oh man…my back is hurting right now...:(
<RainbowFox> You fall and die, then I trollface!
<Crainy> and its not something you can really "learn"
<FlaschenJoe11> Bruce has parts of all elements in him
<happypony> well except that car at the start of inception
<Grundle> Requires additional science
<Turgle> suddenly: plane
<happypony> not sure why that blew up
<fluttercry> seems legit
<Zephirdd> prince-dari: trolling all physics like a boss.
<prince-dari> Zephirdd: XD
<riverhippo> my favorite Nolan movie is Momento
<Meanwhile> Part from the mad
<fluttercry> plane from inception?
<Flameshy> nice plan
<RAWRity> prince-dari I'll wait to talk about it once they've actually repilicated results
<EspyLacopa> I'm pretty sure that happypony is just making that up.
<fluttercry> i swear it's the same plane
<CCCPKiller> are they doing a marathon, or no? and are they doing the new ep
<mib_leeoo4> anyone, latest episode today or tomorow?
<bandgeek> elephants.
<Bjornfot> hmmmm
<happypony> tachyons, the troll particle
<riverhippo> tomorrow at 9am est
<iffyflux> i agree
<GoldenTahu> I love Michael Cain
<Sumica> screw the city, aquire money.
<Zephirdd> mib_leeoo4: tomorrow is s2e2
<Tovler> k, back... DAMMIT
<Ghosties> 04Oh yeah, faster than the speed of light right dari?
<Crainy> many people dont realize how different this movie actually is from the dark knight
<mib_leeoo4> cheers!
<prince-dari> Yeah Ghosties.
<GoldenTahu> g2g. sorry
<Crainy> the dark knight drops soo many ideas from this movie
<deliopen> Wait, what's the name of this movie?
<Ghosties> 04Read about that earlier
<Nittany_Discord> Go tachyons.
<Tovler> I picked a stupid time to cute my pizza
<EmmettBrown> U MAD Einstein?
<Meanwhile> Symbols are bullet proof mr creedey...i mean, Alfred.
<SuperBrony64> deliopen: Batman Begins
<Ghosties> 04@deliopen: Batman Begins
<[ger]Brony1> In europe and east of it : Today
<Zephirdd> Batman Begins, deliopen
<GGgale> wait, dari found a way to completely hide /nick changes in #bronystate now ? o_0
<happypony> "Something elemental, something terrifying... Something with four legs and bright pink hair."
<EspyLacopa> Alfred is best butler.
<SuperBrony64> Ninja'd!
<Ghosties> 04What's your take on it, dari?
<Wrek> 05ah selfish old butler eh?
<deliopen> Ah, thought it was Blade Runner there for a second.
<Fenr> thanks master bruce...really...
<Orange_Peel> hi everyone; 12 hours until twilight kicks discord's butt? ;)
<prince-dari> Only in the embedded client?
<[ger]Brony1> Dirty clothes, dirty face, still, styled hairs.
<Dashite> Alfred, LIKE A BAWS
<Turgle> cool
<Ghosties> 04OH SHIT
<Tovler> 5 meat stuffed pizza. What a monster
<happypony> interesting, I wonder if Alfred still owns all that money in the next movie
<Turgle> HIM
<Lasharus> What's the full title of this film again?
<Lasharus> Batman Begins?
<Ghosties> 04IT'S THAT GUY
<Tehpogo> Dark Knight seems to try and stick Batman and Joker in the "real" world. This is nearly as immersed in its fantasy elements as the Tim Burton movies.
<Turgle> i love he
<Aponymous> Zasz cameo!
<Ghosties> 04Except
<Ghosties> 04wait
<GGgale> oh, duh
<Turgle> *him
<bandgeek> OMGOMG
<RAWRity> I hear they're remaking Batman Begins, they're gonna call it "Batman Continues"
<Fenr> to the moooooon he goes
<Veewave> I think Jean Wilder would be a great batman
<prince-dari> Ghosties: I believe that the uncertainty in their results is large enough such that it's likely the neutrinos weren't traveling faster than light.
<GGgale> that makes more sense >_<
<Ghosties> 04He's not as badass as Scarecrow from Arkham Asylum
<deliopen> What's the movie lineup for tonight?
<happypony> to EqD
<fluttercry> omg Chris Nolan really does just use the same people over and over
<Tovler> Facebook teaser? Same as the youtube one?
<Tovler> O hai, Cillian
<PinkiePie> 13
<Sumica> Wow that guy with the glasses looks like he should have his ass kicked.
<Ghosties> 04I thought the margin of error was like less than 2% or something
<Crainy> indeed
<Jimmy_BB> Caaaarrrlll
<prince-dari> 2% might be enough.
<Ghosties> 04Indeed
<Crainy> however, the problem in this movie is that it also tries to be realistic, and it just doesnt work
<Fenr> batman,still in early concept as hoboman
<Crainy> comes off as weird to me
<[ger]Brony1> Don't watch that teaser, it's a spoiler
<Ghosties> 04IN SCIENCE, NOTHING IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED!
<EmmettBrown> Pluto's mass is 1.31×1022 kg, less than 0.24 percent that of the Earth, while its diameter is 2,306 (+/- 20) km, or roughly 66% that of the Moon
<Meanwhile> For science!
<Dark_Horst> BAT
<EspyLacopa> Bat!
<SuperBrony64> EmmettBrown: That's what Derpy would say
<Turgle> a bat!
<Flutterz> IM MATBAN
<happypony> okay I lol'd at that pinkie conscience comic
<Orange_Peel> yeah that's right sorry lol
<Turgle> TO THE MOOOOOON
<prince-dari> I'd rather not believe that it's true Ghosties.
<Jimmy_BB> Guys
<Ghosties> 04Why not?
<prince-dari> Otherwise my physics course is just fucking blown out the window.
<Ghosties> 04Oh
<Flameshy> lolz
<Ghosties> 04Well
<Jimmy_BB> If that bat hadn't showed up
<Tovler> Bats fly WAY more rapidly in a house
<prince-dari> Then I get to hear my teacher say
<Jimmy_BB> We'd have Hoboman
<prince-dari> >all we've learnt
<prince-dari> >it's wrong
<Combustiblelemons> poor prince-dari D:
<prince-dari> XD
<Turgle> yep
<EspyLacopa> You know how a lot of windows have a screen on the outside so you can have a window open but still keep bugs out?
<LordCelestia> Face your fears batman
<Jimmy_BB> We'd have the motherfucking HOBOMAN
<Grundle> Everything you know is wrong~
<happypony> don't they say that all the time anyway
<SuperBrony64> I'm not paying attention, what's the debate that's going on?
<fluttercry> if I was alfred I'd start dumping water down there
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> SCIENC
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> E
<Turgle> enjoy physic course
<Fenr> we have lost a great thing thanks to that bat
<Dark_Horst> the concept of hoboman is actually rather interesting
<Flaria> EspyLacopa: Yeah?
<Tovler> I wish they had flying foxes in America
<GGgale> neutrinos going faster than light, SuperBrony64
<Meanwhile> Giggle at the bats bruce.
<Ghosties> 04Apparently if it is true, then science isn't ready just yet to discard Einstein's theory since it's held up for so long
<Flutterz> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6...I am Hoboman
<Dark_Horst> they should make a movie out of that
<EspyLacopa> Last year, when I woke up one morning, I found a bat snoozing in the space between the window and the mesh.
<Flutterz> It is called a well, sir
<Flaria> D'awwww
<RAWRity> prince-dari now you know how Med Students feal every few months when there'a new drug of inovation, and the last 3 years of study is not obsolete
<FlaschenJoe11> Dr Insano, the Master of SCIENCE!
<Combustiblelemons> Anyone seen hobo with a shotgun?
<happypony> we'll never discard einstein's theory, but we may modify it
<Grundle> D'awww
<Nittany_Discord> Special relativity is extremely accurate. I wouldn't throw it away. Gallileian relativity hasn't quite been thrown away yet.
<Orange_Peel> If the writing on ep 2 is as awesome as ep 1 *sqee*
<fluttercry> I'm aware of this invention
<EmmettBrown> All laws have rebels right?
<EspyLacopa> It was adorable.
<Flutterz> There should be water in it
<Grundle> Hobo with a shotgun is a pretty good movie
<Combustiblelemons> goriest film I've ever seen.
<SuperBrony64> Neutrinos don't go faster than light, they travel NEAR the speed of light through all matter almost undistrubed.
<SirSprinkles> 6Anyone seen a hobo with a broadsword?
<EspyLacopa> I didnt have the heart to kick out the snoozing bat.
<Combustiblelemons> I haven't
<Dashite> EspyLacopa awesome. :D
<RainbowFox> But as you can see, there is water right here.
<prince-dari> RainBro said that about halfway through one of my physics modules the experiments with the large hadron collider will be finished, and that'll prove something like half of my physics module to be either right of wrong.
<Flutterz> That's what alfred would be saying
<techdude300> This event inspires him to become: Owlman!
<Sumica> Never trust a Scientist, who knows when they will just change the laws
<Tovler> I used to live under a colony of bats
<RainbowFox> Hence, no need for more.
<EmmettBrown> Hobo with a military grade mine clearer
<Dermathil> Ghosties, it most likely isn't true, since they went over the speed of light by a time shorter than the number of decimals they have rounded it by.
<happypony> has the LHC done ANYTHING useful yet
<Dark_Horst> well, the CERN dudes believe the new experiment could prove them FASTER than light
<Nittany_Discord> LHC is finished.
<prince-dari> So all my shit has 2 chances of being screwed up.
<EspyLacopa> techdude300: What about Catman?
*Ghosties shrugs
<fluttercry> you probably though those bats were real
<ThePretender> DAT LEIFMOTIF
<happypony> I haven't heard about it since all the 'end of the world' nonsense
<Crainy> i wonder if all the bats are cgi
<Sumica> So what if he was frightend by a horse when he was a kid?
<Nittany_Discord> It's just not been tested at full power yet.
<bandgeek> nope
<Ghosties> 04I'm not a science major
<Flutterz> But can you drop a bucket into the well and get water? Nope, just Chuck Testa
<RAWRity> And then Bruce constructed a Suit made of living Bats and called himself BATSUIT
<prince-dari> Nittany_Discord: Yeah, but conclusions drawn from the results or whatever, I dunno.
<techdude300> He's changes every 10 weeks
<PinkiePie> No obviously they fired the writers after episode one
<Ghosties> 04So, I'm not too concerned
<SuperBrony64> Neutrinos are very difficult to measure as they really can't be detected easily unless something gets deflected because of it.
<Combustiblelemons> So when is the LHC firing up again?
<techdude300> Ratman is due in April
<Orange_Peel> lol
<Dermathil> LHC is doing great stuff. Most of chat don't understand what they do exactly entails.
<Combustiblelemons> I heard so many things about why it broke
<SirSprinkles> 6...what if when he was a kid...
<happypony> they smash things together really fast
<RAWRity> anybody read the webcomic Ratfist?
<GGgale> Dermathil, i know i sure don't!
<SirSprinkles> 6he was scared by Sea Ponies?
<fluttercry> there's an app for that
<prince-dari> I though all LHC did was smash particles together at high speed or something?
<Combustiblelemons> Even one that the universe itself is stopping the experiment from working.
<Travis_Ball> ;o
<Wrek> 05seaponyman!
<Meanwhile> Seaponyman for the win.
<Nittany_Discord> It does.
<FlaschenJoe11> HE'S GOT NO SUPERPOWERS! HE'S Just a Flyin' RAAAAT!
<EspyLacopa> Shoo be doo
<Tovler> Aquaman was scared of Sea Ponies
<Jimmy_BB> Seaponarang!
<Jervill> He was bit by Lyra seapony while young.
<Flaria> SirSprinkles: I don't know. <3
<Ghosties> 04Strap her down to watch MLP Newborns, that'll shut her mouth...or drive her insane
<Meanwhile> SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
<Travis_Ball> :D
<RainbowFox> there's a pony for that
<EspyLacopa> FlaschenJoe11: Music Meister is best villain.
<EmmettBrown> Astronomers, assuming Pluto to be Lowell's Planet X, initially calculated its mass based on its presumed effect on Neptune and Uranus.
<Flameshy> Yay :D
<GGgale> It's a good thing we've got Arkham cuz he really drives us bats!
<Combustiblelemons> LHC studies these collisions and tries to find the "higgs boson" or god particle.
<Amino> What movie is on tonight after this one?
<FlaschenJoe11> yup yup yup
<Fenr> ..and start selling mass murder weapons *calls tony stark*
<Grundle> Meanwhile is a sea pony

<Turgle> tony stark xD
<Travis_Ball> :|
<Meanwhile> I am, but don't tell anyone.
<happypony> Arrrrrgh, I HATE it when people call higgs boson the god particle
<fluttercry> cause wayne is getting some that's why
<Ghosties> 04Arkham City is gonna be freaking awesome
<happypony> that's such a stupid media-driven line of bull
<Turgle> sorry to disappoint xD
<Tovler> dat quip
<Grundle> I hate it when people call the god particle the higgs boson >:O
<Flaria> Meanwhile, do you want a seapony text tone? :3
<Dezmin> I love that line
<Rainbow_derp> I'm back
<SuperBrony64> Ghosties: With Tara Strong playing Harley Quinn, you bet :P
<Zephirdd> happypony: both dont exist, whats the difference? :D
<ThePretender> Arkham City looks amazing
<RAWRity> ;)
<Meanwhile> Yes Flaria, yes i do.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> ba dum tish
<Fenr> a job at my own company...maybe i'm asking too much
<SuperBrony64> I'm waiting to get it on the Wii U though :P
<Ghosties> 04Definitely, SuperBrony64. That's an awesome extra bonus
<Turgle> FOX!
<happypony> it's not that, it's that they're implying that finding the boson will solve everything ever
<Turgle> he's the boss
<Tovler> >Wii U
<RainbowFox> I want to work for MORGAN FREEMAN
<Lasharus> Hey Morgan :D
<fluttercry> God on his day off
<LordCelestia> MORGAN FREEMAN
<FlaschenJoe11> just wait. after the release we have Twilight Quinn videos everywhere
<Combustiblelemons> morgon freeman!
<SuperBrony64> OMG
<Flameshy> same here :3
<LordCelestia> :D
<Combustiblelemons> YES!
<EmmettBrown> I don't just do planets,I do moons,stars,planets,dwarf planets,binary planetary system,solar systems,galaxies,black holes,white holes,wormholes,space itself.All sortd of things
<SuperBrony64> It's him!
<EspyLacopa> Lucius Fox vs Lucius Malfoy
<Zecora> Morgan Freeman
<prince-dari> Ohai God.
<SuperBrony64> I didn't know he was in this movie.
<Fenr> the batbin,more or less
<Dezmin> Fox
<Nightshade> morgan freeman makes everything awesome
<riverhippo> and now the reason why this is truly a great movie, Mr. Freeman
<ThePretender> RED
<Combustiblelemons> *worships gordan feeman*
<Dezmin> Wait, this is a sexy contest, right?
<Tovler> Morgan Freeman creates cyber dolphins
<Nightshade> lol
<Aponymous> Batman has God on his side, that's why he always wins.
<Ghosties> 04But the idea of a fully functioning sandbox open world instead of a linear setting is going to be fucking righteous
<Lasharus> Was that facebook? :P
<SuperBrony64> Bruce Wayne is just as shocked to see Morgan Freeman as we are
<fluttercry> "and so the batman began his journey through the gotham underworld."(Freeman vioce"
<happypony> dat facebook
<Jervill> Morgan Freeman, who was Gordon Freeman's brother, wet on platform down to teh basebment.
<Crainy> i love these parts of this movie
<Grundle> Sandboxen are over-rated
<ThePretender> Morgan Freeman can get you stuff in jail
<happypony> oh luna, y u so popular
<EspyLacopa> If it isnt, Fox may turn it into one anyways.
<Crainy> probably my favorite part of the movie
<GabeMoist> EmmettBrown, what binary star has the fastest orbit?
<Nightshade> someone got a facebook ping
<Ghosties> 04And yes, hello Morgan. You is mah favorite actor ever
<Wrek> 05ghosties
<Sumica> so why did he show him that besides exposision?
<Luna> 07,1guilty!
<Tovler> I can't wait to see Luna tomorrow
*Dezmin sagely nods
<Ghosties> 04Wrek?
<riverhippo> Morgan Freeman whould narrate a pony episode
<Wrek> 05your face when i get batman arkham city with my graphics card
<riverhippo> should
<GGgale> Malfoy has a pimp cane, though...
<Wrek> 05included
<a041744> Seems legit
<happypony> spelunking.
<Jimmy_BB> Spelunking.
<Fenr> *not sure if serious*
<EspyLacopa> Spelunking /is/ rather dangerous.
<fluttercry> Taliban caves
<Ghosties> 04varyingdegreesofwant
<Grundle> Morgan Freeman should voice everypony
<EmmettBrown> RX J0806.3+1527
<Dermathil> hehehehe... Clever Morgan is clever.
<FlaschenJoe11> just wait. after the release of Arkham City we have Twilight Quinn videos everywhere
<EspyLacopa> Never know what you'll run into. Havent you played Cave Story?
<Rainbow_derp> wait did he...
<a041744> The caves are serious business
<Ghosties> 04I'm getting it for the 360
<[ger]Brony1> Bitches love a latex-suit
<happypony> The Descent
<Ghosties> 04So
<Flutterz> Spelunking is dangerous - you might encounter skeletons, zombies or even creepers! :P
<prince-dari> Tim Curry for transexual Transylvanian Batman.
<Ghosties> 04Doesn't bother me all that much
<FriendshipCannon> HOW CONVENIENT
<FlaschenJoe11> also Fanart
<Lasharus> I love Alfred's reaction. :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I would love to go spelunking with Batman.
<Turgle> charming xD
<Lasharus> "Charming"
<RAWRity> Morgan Freeman, who made "Magical Negro" nearly his entire career description
*Dermathil approves of dari's commment.
<Tovler> Morgan Freeman didn't hit it big until his 50s?
<fluttercry> or endermen or silverfish
<Sumica> well if it's qall mine then lets box it up and send it to my cav.....er house
<SuperBrony64> The Bat Cave!
<Combustiblelemons> The bat cave :D
<bandgeek> oh dear god-not the creepers!
<Crainy> suddenly
<Crainy> music
<RainbowFox> Don't think the armor helps with lava though.
<Dark_Horst> YAH DAT LOOKS SAFE
<fluttercry> that's a nice batcave you got there
<Turgle> i love alfred's irony
<happypony> dat zimmer drumbeat
<Turgle> and sarcasm
<ThePretender> I'm getting Ace Combat instead of Arkham City
<interior_gummy> SPOILER ALERT: the next episode has ponies in it
<bandgeek> it'd be a shame if anything happened to it.
<Turgle> omg
<Zephirdd> damn gummy
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Damn you
<EmmettBrown> ~If I run out of pluto trivia,I will start doing charon trivia instead
<Ghosties> 04Whoa
<Lagmobile> so much natural light for an underground cave...
<Dezmin> That detracts
<riverhippo> dangit gummy
<EspyLacopa> But does it have Discord?
<Tovler> It also has Luna in it
<Lasharus> You miserable bastard Gummy.
<Ghosties> 04We just went RE5 for a moment
<SuperBrony64> What's the name of the actor that plays the butler?
<RAWRity> SPOILER ALERT: also, discord does stuff
<happypony> Charon has trivia? x.x
<a041744> Micheal caine
<Jervill> Isn't Charon a dormant Mass Relay?
<happypony> it's just a ball of ice
<LordCelestia> You just ruined it for me gummi i wanted to be suprised!
<fluttercry> spray paint black armor black
<EspyLacopa> Malfoy also wears a dress.
<Lasharus> Why's he spraypainting black armour black?
<fluttercry> makes sense
<Dermathil> Jervill: it is.
<EmmettBrown> In 1955 Pluto was calculated to be roughly the mass of the Earth, with further calculations in 1971 bringing the mass down to roughly that of Mars.
<prince-dari> EmmettBrown: Maybe save the trivia for whne it's relevant to the conversation?
<a041744> Needs to be blacker
<Lasharus> I mean, isn't that just a BIT superfluous?
<Bjornfot> :I
<Fenr> to make it more black
<kirzstryfe> to hide the batnipples
<Ghosties> 04WE NEED TO GET DARKER
<happypony> it's SMOOTH black
<LunaTheForgotten> ...and I'm back
<Dashite> Because it wasn't totally black.
<Bjornfot> ME GUSTA
<Tovler> Emmett...
<Zephirdd> Because Black Lasharus
<Lasharus> Ghehe.
<EspyLacopa> I don't think the pimp cane works well with a dress.
<[ger]Brony1> We need to go BLACKER!
<LunaTheForgotten> What did I miss
<interior_gummy> what are the pony eps tonight?
<Lasharus> Turn off that bleedin' facebook tab already! :P
<WhatPayne> This music really helps the movie
<Flameshy> it would be better if it was rainbow
<EspyLacopa> The only guy who pulls off that kind of dress well is Jude Claude Frollo.
<Turgle> 10k pieces
<happypony> at least we'll have spares....
<GGgale> Rarity proved dresses are manly though.
<a041744> Good thing Im a billionaire idiot
<Fenr> that was a standard black batman
<EmmettBrown> Hmmm
<EspyLacopa> *Judge
<Fenr> he painted it to miller batman black level
<bandgeek> yes. yes indeed.
<Nittany_Discord> 10,000 tetrahedrons?
<happypony> I like how they do it subtly
<Sumica> Oh hi Gordon
<happypony> by ordering 10k
<GGgale> >Jude Claude, r63 Hunchback character
<happypony> aaaah, Flass
<happypony> <3 this guy
<EmmettBrown> Not sure how often the subject of conversation turns to pluto
<Tovler> Hanz Zimmer seriouses the fuck out of everything he's in
<riverhippo> Gordon aged pretty well, lol
<Flameshy> Correction 20% cooler
<prince-dari> Trending?
<fluttercry> I just noticed the guy from breaking bad looks like Gary Oldman
<[ger]Brony1> "Hey guys, look! Somebody ordered 10.000 latex-masks. That sounds legit."
<Zephirdd> Nittany_Discord: you mean 10 Gigahedrons
<Tovler> like Twitter?

<SirSprinkles> 6Except I have no idea what it is!
<riverhippo> Hanz Zimmer is making the music for the new "Spyro" game apparently
<Fenr> batman concept number 2,banckrobberman
<EspyLacopa> At least he doesn't sparkle.
<Rainbow_derp> needs more trending up it EQD!
<prince-dari> Yeah, it's Twitter
