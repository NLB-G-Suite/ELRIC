<Gold_Demona> I don't like playing Sonic 3 by itself, cuz it's only half the game.
<VenHur> Sonic and Knuckles, Eh, it's still great, nothing to say about it...
<Bronysith> the last good sonic game was Adventure 2 battle
<Dken2021> yea, easy mode is pretty pathetic
<Blako> Hi
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Hey sonic colors was good
<Applejack2012> Spagetthi all around
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So was generations
<cachi01|phone> Easy mode is always pathetic Dken2021
<Gold_Demona> Sonic and Knuckles isn't meant to be played by itself.
<Gold_Demona> Because it's the second half of Sonic 3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Knuckle's story takes place after Sonic's adventure right?
<VenHur> Sonic 3 and Knuckles, Behold, THE greatest Sonic game out there, It's the first and only to feature...SEIZURE SONI-I mean...Hyper Sonic!
<cachi01|phone> Sonic 4 was meh
<Gold_Demona> LOL, yes. AND Super Tails
<Iron_Edge> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d5haav4
<VenHur> And Super Tails...and Hyper Knuckles...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sonic 4's website said they happened at the same time..some how
<Gold_Demona> Don't forget Super Tails and his FLICKY ARMY OF DEATH!!!
<cachi01|phone> SCREW SUPER TAILS
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So why does tails need the super emeralds to go super?
<cachi01|phone> Ask Sega
<VenHur> Sonic 3D Blast: Eh...it's...OKAY...but the over the head view kind of ruined it...
<Dken2021> because he's a genius and needs the extra amount of power? iunno
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Inexperience with the chaos emerald energy?
<VenHur> And the Special Stages are not much of an challenge...
<Bronysith> i prefer super mario bros 3...
<cachi01|phone> Super mario bros 3 is so fucking awesome
<VenHur> Unlike Sonic 3's special stages...
<Gold_Demona> Mario 3 was awesome too
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Break dancing eggman!
<cachi01|phone> mmmm i think i will play some super mario bros 3 on my nes
<Gold_Demona> Am I the only person here who loves Sonic and Mario equally?
<VenHur> Sonic Adventure, it's...still good...but it haven't aged well for me.
<Dken2021> for those who don't know what SpadeMagnes[School] is talking about http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJVabLZl3kw
<Applejack2012> Sonic Adventure ruled
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Who was Eggman in SA 1?
<VenHur> Could of been better...if it haven't been for Big The Cat...
<cachi01|phone> Gold_Demona i used to loved them equal. But then my love for sonic was kinda going down
<VenHur> *sniff* ...Gamma...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> VenHur: Aka Duke Nukem
<Applejack2012> if you take Big away
<cachi01|phone> But i have a sonic plushie =D
<cachi01|phone> And i love it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I still find it hilarious Big the cat was voiced by Duke Nukem...
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Cypresswolf> Im gonna get some sleep - might be back later...if im well enough
<cachi01|phone> SpadeMagnes wut .-.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Not kididng
<Dken2021> seeya cy--oh
<VenHur> Sonic Adventure 2, the story's fantasic, the levels were great (expect for Knuckles and Rouge's, they're kind of a pain..), and the music's awesome.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also why IS big in the game?
<Applejack2012> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6h0dcudMAA :D
<Dken2021> cameos
<cachi01|phone> SpadeMagnes cause froggy
<Gold_Demona> I like how Big the Cat was an easter egg in SA2
<VenHur> ...And who's idea was to make Rouge's concept in the first place...?
<Applejack2012> Sonic Youtube poop2008
<cachi01|phone> FROOOOGGYYYYY
<SpadeMagnes[School]> VenHur: some very sexualy deprived man
<Bronysith> chrono trigger is very much win
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: No argument there.
<Applejack2012> Where are you Froggy
<cachi01|phone> VenHur Cause fanservice ftw?
<Gold_Demona> FROGGY! D:
<Dken2021> VenHur it was around the time sonic team though sonic needed to be edgy and have a story
<cachi01|phone> Press X to Froggy
<Bronysith> Chrono trigger is pretty much my fav game, too goddamn good
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Does Big contribute ANYTHING to the plot?
<cachi01|phone> No
<Bronysith> nope
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So why is he there?
<cachi01|phone> Not at all
<Gold_Demona> Nope
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[School]: havent you ever heard of shoehorned in characters?
<Dken2021> he.....uh.....found froggy
<Gold_Demona> Because... reasons?
<cachi01|phone> Cause froggy needs to be saved
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They apperently made Big because they didnt want a character that went fast all the time
<Gold_Demona> Who else was gonna save Froggy? D:
<Dken2021> who....had swallowed an emerald for no reason.....
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Which is...retarded
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Alls well that ends well
<cachi01|phone> Gotta save froggy
<Dken2021> ....but the city is bucking destroyed.....
<Gold_Demona> Froggy!
<Gold_Demona> Save Froggy! D:<
<Gold_Demona> By fishing for him!
<Gold_Demona> Lots... and lots... of fishing
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why does tails seem shoehorned into SA2?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What characters were in the origional SA2?
<Kimori> hey
<Gold_Demona> I think the fact that they made Tails the "mech pilot" character was stupid.
<Applejack2012> why so many questions? :D
<VenHur> Sonic Heroes, I think this is where the Dark Age of Sonic began, sure the game's great and all, but Sonic and his friends just won't shut up!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also SA2 marks the people of sonic's world having poor eyesight problems
<VenHur> Also, TEAMWORK FTW?!
<Gold_Demona> In the original SA2, it was Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, Big, and E102 Gamma. I think.
<cachi01|phone> SpadeMagnes well the robot. Shadow, Rogue,sonic,tails,knuckles,amy and cream
<Gold_Demona> Oh and Amy
<Gold_Demona> Shadow and Rouge weren't in the first one
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349540958759.gif
<Gold_Demona> They appeared in SA2
<CrimsonPhoenix> Great gif
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well who was playable in SA2?
<VenHur> Shadow The Hedgehog, seriously...Shadow with a motorcycle...and guns? The hell SEGA?
<Bronysith> its called they gave up
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sonic Shadow, Rouge Knuckle, Tails Eggman
<cachi01|phone> SpadeMagnes. Playable? Sonic tails knuckles shadow the robot and rogue
<Bronysith> they realized sonic was dead
<Bronysith> so they try anything
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix hehe
<CrimsonPhoenix> Three types of gameplay two set of stage each
<cachi01|phone> VenHur atleast the story was good.....
<Bronysith> cachi01|phone: nope
<VenHur> Sonic 06, ...NEVER. BUY. THIS. GAME.
<Applejack2012> lovely gif :D
<cachi01|phone> I hated rogue stages
<CrimsonPhoenix> VenHur, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MWEHwvcnyM
<Gold_Demona> VenHur: LOL Watching a Let's Play of it was enough for me
<cachi01|phone> They were fakin impossible
<Dken2021> the concept for shadow was good.....but playing levels again and to find out there's just one good ending? blech
<alexxm> hey guys
<Dken2021> hey alexxm
<cachi01|phone> Hi alexxm :)
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo alexxm
<Applejack2012> good evening
<Dken2021> how are ya?
<Bronysith> i want to tear my eyes out from the sockets and shit in them
<Bronysith> friggin End of Evengelion
<alexxm> how are things Dken2021 cachi01|phone and Gold_Demona
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I fucking love I am all of me
<Gold_Demona> Wow, extreme much Bronysith?
<cachi01|phone> Ok guys now lets talk about that one thing we all spend atleast 4 years of our lives in it.........chao garden
<Gold_Demona> Goin' good, alexxm
<VenHur> Sonic Unleashed, what a breath of fresh it would of been better without the Werehog gimmick, but I don't mind...
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: you try dealing with this depressive anime
<Dken2021> things are swell Alchemist
<VenHur> *air
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: I have. A couple of times
<Dken2021> er.. alexxm
<alexxm> ok
<SpadeMagnes[School]> People compare the werehog to GoW too much
<cachi01|phone> Chao garden is best garden
<Bronysith> I need to get a copy of devil may cry 3
<Bronysith> and ninja gaiden
<Dken2021> mmhmm, my cousins loved the chao garden
<CrimsonPhoenix> Werehog was actually cool
<cachi01|phone> I loved chao garden
<CrimsonPhoenix> I admit I was a bit annoyed at first
<SpadeMagnes[School]> CUBE!
<CrimsonPhoenix> but once you unlock every move it's a blast
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Wii version was shit though...
<Panda> O_o you guys are still talking about sonix?
<Panda> sonic*
<Gold_Demona> I'm mostly "meh" about the werehog, but the daytime levels were lots of fun. =)
<Bronysith> WII version is always shit
<Panda> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> Though Unleashed can't argue with his final boss
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh GOD that final boss
<Panda> twilight_sprinkle SPRINKLE!
<cachi01|phone> I've never finished sonic unleashed. I.got bored so i havent played it in a year
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Fuck that button mash!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> FUCK IT TO HELL
<Panda> I beat it within the first day, it was too easy
<alexxm> is there a stream for some reason my internet doesn't like showing streams
<Gold_Demona> I've never made it to the final boss of Unleashed. I always lose interest somewhere along the way
<VenHur> Bad news though...I owned the Wii version...so I didn't know what the Africa themed level was like...
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda: PANDAAA *nos&glomps*:3
<twilight_sprinkle> *noms
<Panda> :)
<Gold_Demona> alexxm, there is no stream
<Panda> how you been?
<twilight_sprinkle> curse you typos
<cachi01|phone> I own the PS3 version
<VenHur> Yeah, they removed that level in the Wii version...don't know why, but...o..kay then.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why would anyone think pressing x 50 times was a good idea
<CrimsonPhoenix> Also another problem with unleashed was MEDAL COLLECT
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda: eh ok i guess. tired atm. what about you?
<CrimsonPhoenix> That was annoying as fuck
<cachi01|phone> Sonic 06 can go fuck itself
<Gold_Demona> The only new Sonic game I've beaten is Sonic Generations.
<Dken2021> dang net connection
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh what's that? You passed the other levels but didn't collect enough medals?
<Gold_Demona> I really liked that one, though I wish there was more content
<Panda> I'm good, got some stuff done this morning :3 now im just drawing stuffs for a friend twilight_sprinkle
<CrimsonPhoenix> TOO BAD
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I've pretty much beaten every sonic game
<SpadeMagnes[School]> At least you can just find them lying around
<cachi01|phone> I've never beaten sonic advance 2 :(
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Unlike the wii which requires speed
<VenHur> Sonic Colors: This was Unleashed, but better thought out, I liked the Wisp gimmick too.
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda: nice, the only thing i can draw is graphs :D
<cachi01|phone> I loved sonic advance
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh fuck the Sonic advanced 2 special stage
<Panda> twilight_sprinkle D: I cant draw those! I fail so hard!
<CrimsonPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[School], the medal requirement was ridiculous at some point
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The requirement is so bullshit
<cachi01|phone> SpadeMagnes amen
<Gold_Demona> Sadly, I've never played Sonic Colors. I've heard good things about it though.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I should play Sonic Colours
<cachi01|phone> ^
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[School] the special stages were pretty easy, but yea, the requiremets to get there are stupid
<Gold_Demona> I should GET Sonic Colors
<CrimsonPhoenix> sadly the game bored me at some point
<SpadeMagnes[School]> DRILL!
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda: heh, i remember drawing my math teachers face with graphs :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> LASER!
<Gold_Demona> RRRRROCKET!
<CrimsonPhoenix> maybe now I'll be more patient
<SpadeMagnes[School]> BURST!
<VenHur> And Finally, Sonic Generations, oh my god...this is where I gone back to playing Sonic, all those nostalgia, the remixed music...it's too BRILLIANT!
<CrimsonPhoenix> but seriously for those who haven't played 06 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MWEHwvcnyM
<alexxm> CYCLONE JOKER
<cachi01|phone> Btw i remember there was this weird egg in sonic advance 2 in the chao garden.......what was it about?
<CrimsonPhoenix> VenHur, you bought the game for nostalgia?
<Gold_Demona> VanHur: Yes, I really liked Generations. Again, I wish there was more content to it.
<Gold_Demona> I'd love to see them add more worlds to it
<CrimsonPhoenix> why not buy every Sega Genesis collection out there
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's pretty much what Sega is good for these days
<SpadeMagnes[School]> God forbid Sega does dlc
<Gold_Demona> CrimsonPhoenix: Because the Genesis collection isn't remakes.
<VenHur> Seriously, I banged my head a lot while listening to the Super Sonic Racing theme. And Escape from the City too.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How long did it take for Unleashed to even get DlC?
<Gold_Demona> Unleashed has DlC?
<cachi01|phone> Yes
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Apperently
<cachi01|phone> A new country
<Gold_Demona> I only have the PS2 version, so that's news to me.
<CrimsonPhoenix> >not listening to Acid Remix of Can you feel the sunshine http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrplxzlM8MY
<CrimsonPhoenix> ISHYGGIDY
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The kind of dlc i dislike is the stuff thats allready on the disk
<alexxm> yeah everyone hates on disk DLC
<VenHur> Altough, I wished there's was DLC for that game...I heard about a pinball themed level for Sonic Generations.
<cachi01|phone> VenHur escape from the city is awesome
<CrimsonPhoenix> Those Mario DLC were pretty alright in my opinion
<Gold_Demona> VenHur: Yeah the Casino Night level
<Gold_Demona> VenHur: I have it. It's fun
<VenHur> Oh yeah, that level, brilliant...
<Gold_Demona> If you like pinball, that is. :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> That level is just a pinball mini game
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's it
<Gold_Demona> I like it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> pre order bonus
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's not a Pinball level
<VenHur> Can't wait for the next Sonic game, oh how will Eggman gets out of the whiteness...
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's just a minigame
<cachi01|phone> Yeah now we have to wait for zelda and metroid.DLC on the Wii U
<Gold_Demona> Of course I would've prefered a full Casino Night Zone level, but the pinball's fun too
<cachi01|phone> :,/
<CrimsonPhoenix> VenHur, I don't think there's a continuity now
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also guess what europe and japan got that america didnt
<CrimsonPhoenix> I mean sure there was one before but now?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They got a artbook a statue and other stuff
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/Xx-yryFIB6E
<CrimsonPhoenix> My god I think I'm falling in a Sonic mood now....
<CrimsonPhoenix> NO
<CrimsonPhoenix> MY PAST
<CrimsonPhoenix> Don't come back to me
<CrimsonPhoenix> I flee you for a reason
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also Sonic Colors has THE LONGEST credits ever....
*SpadeMagnes[School] starts humming reach for the stars
<Gold_Demona> I really liked the remixed Casino Night Zone music for that /MINI GAME/.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcCrHZAKfPI
<SpadeMagnes[School]> EMBRACE IT
<Gold_Demona> It was always one of my favorite tracks from Sonic 2.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rarity's theme song if she was in Sonic R http://youtu.be/zex_DZcEn4o
<SpadeMagnes[School]> No one remembers Nights anymore
<cachi01|phone> SpadeMagnes night was bsd
<cachi01|phone> Nights*
<cachi01|phone> Bad*
<CrimsonPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[School], I got the shitty sequel
<Gold_Demona> I never played Nights. =P
<cachi01|phone> The sequel sucks ass
<alexxm> how was nights bad from what i've seen it looks pretty decent
<SpadeMagnes[School]> UNLIMITED COLORS!
<CrimsonPhoenix> I would LOVE to play the sequel and knowing Sega I guess it's just a matter of time until it gets on Steam
<CrimsonPhoenix> NiGHTS wasn't bad
<CrimsonPhoenix> maybe the sequel is
<cachi01|phone> alexxm to be honest i only played the shitty sequel for wii
<CrimsonPhoenix> but the original was beautiful for its time
<Gold_Demona> Does anyone remember Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Nope
<Gold_Demona> That game was cute, but kinda boring.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gold_Demona, I know a person that does
<CrimsonPhoenix> I want a dreamcast....
<alexxm> i saw an advert for it in a comic but i didn't play it
<cachi01|phone> Gold_Demona a friend of mine has that game
<CrimsonPhoenix> so many good games on it
<Gold_Demona> I have it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smJ3HoxaaL8
<Applejack2012> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXHw8o6UI9M
<cachi01|phone> CrimsonPhoenix same here
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I love Doomsday Zone
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Fucking love the Project Chaos remix of it
*cachi01|phone completed sonic adventure DX 100%
*Bronysith doesnt care
<alexxm> CrimsonPhoenix my cousin had a dreamcast he had sonic adventure marvel vs capcom and a load of other games
<cachi01|phone> Its so freaking easy
<CrimsonPhoenix> alexxm, does he still have it?
<CrimsonPhoenix> if yes where do you live
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Is it Hydro City or Hydrocity?
<alexxm> CrimsonPhoenix i think he gave it to another cousin who couldn't afford any of this gens systems
<Gold_Demona> I believe it's Hydro City
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's sweet
<alexxm> yeah
<VenHur> Oh, I have Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_181FnvwOg Needs more Lava Reef
<pinkiepieguy> No stream?
<VenHur> Great game and all...
<cachi01|phone> pinkiepieguy nope
<VenHur> ...BUT WHY IN GOD'S NAME DO I (or rather Billy himself...) HAVE TO WEAR A CHICKEN SUIT?!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Fucking love lava reef
<alexxm> VenHur to appease the furries
<Ghost_of_Dken2021> chicken suit?
<Gold_Demona> VenHur: because the chicken suit is magic and gives Billy his chicken powers. :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What I heard Labarynth zone was supposed to be after green hill
<pinkiepieguy> MLP is next on Hub
<Gold_Demona> You telling me you don't wanna be Scootaloo?
<Ghost_of_Dken2021> oh, billy hatcher, never played that gmae
<CrimsonPhoenix> My most favorite song in Generation http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EdNeCCqYFw
<cachi01|phone> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dHo_3NRRmY&feature=youtube_gdata_player >_>
<Gold_Demona> Yes, I love Chemical Plant Zone. =D
<CrimsonPhoenix> just while playing Chemical Plant Zone while hearing this made me love it
<Gold_Demona> I prefer the classic remix though
<BladedWings> i like the Casino Night zone...mainly cause of the music lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gold_Demona, there's no BLUDUBULOOP
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySsrnlj6MfE Needs more Death Egg robo
<VenHur> Would of been freaking hillarious if the suit made him becamed a real chicken...Oh god...I just gave away a fanfic idea to the furries...
<Gold_Demona> Yes, I love Casino Night's music
<Gold_Demona> CrimsonPhoenix: LOL true
<CrimsonPhoenix> That
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't know something about that got in me
<CrimsonPhoenix> it was like HOLY SHIT
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also apperently you can spin dash under the egg robo when it leaps up
<VenHur> Oh well...wonder if they'll made a sequel to Billy Hatcher...really underrated...
<CrimsonPhoenix> It felt special in a way and how it fit the large view of the level at the start
<cachi01|phone> VenHur they wont
<cachi01|phone> I dont think.so
<CrimsonPhoenix> and City Escape is overrated due to Nostalgia
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODKaVpMYZfg&feature=related Needs more Crysis City
<Applejack2012> that City Escape Nostalgia overload
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *Crisis
<CrimsonPhoenix> also I think you can't beat the truck now in Generation
<VenHur> There's should be a mashup of the Classic, Modern, and original 06 versions of Crisis City...I would Eargasm...
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/hnUgeEGstDU Like this
<SpadeMagnes[School]> VenHur: I have just what you want
<Gold_Demona> The only way Billy Hatcher will ever appear again is if Sonic Team makes one of those "crossover compilation morass of characters" type of game. Like Super Smash Bros. or a racing game.
<Gold_Demona> Which they'll never do
<Gold_Demona> I agree City Escape is overrated, but I still love it. :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> SONIC VS BIG ASS TRUCK WHO WINS
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Give me a minuete to find it
<Gold_Demona> LMAO That truck glitch. XD

<CrimsonPhoenix> You know as horrible as Sonic 06 was
<CrimsonPhoenix> its soundtrack was still the most amazing thing
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The music never falters

<Gold_Demona> No it's not
<Blako> If anybody had a little bit time, I need to test my Sparx game engine a little bit. Just if it works on other maschines than mine :D
<Gold_Demona> School is social hell for introverts
<SpadeMagnes[School> I should be able to learn shit on my own pace
<Cades> yeah sure
<alexxm> it's either school or the battle royale kid
<Bronysith> Middle school can die in a fire

<SpadeMagnes[School> Besides I probably wont use half the crap I learn
<thelonepony> ^^^

<Randomnerd> And that's all I can say, really. Those who haven't seen it really should.
<alexxm> Randomnerd i saw it saturday any idea what would have summoned kevin
<Randomnerd> Maybe a pair of glasses?
<Randomnerd> I automatically assumed it was a reference to Sin City.

<Ghost_of_Dken2021> and you must scream?
<Bronysith> luna is so sexy
<Bronysith> Ghost_of_Dken2021: /)
<Gold_Demona> Dark92Enigma: Did you try completely closing your browser and restarting it again? Cuz that's what I had to do.
<Randomnerd> Hey, have you guys seen this video?
<alexxm> well that means a scorpion crawling on your face SpadesMagnes|School
<Dark92Enigma> Gold_Demona: i'll do that......
<Randomnerd> I'm a little embarrassed to ask, but I worked on it, it's a puppet show :D
<Ghost_of_Dken2021> Bronysith /)
*SpadeMagnes[School swats it off with his sword arm
<Randomnerd> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iolpKBgJ-Oc&feature=plcp
<Blako> for example if you had IE set to automatically download files without asking, it may download and open it for you, and if you have zip associated with IE, it will download it again and then open it and so on, but this isn't propably the cause... just guessig
<Cades> maybe
<Applejack2012> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UtuKeS6igE :D
<Randomnerd> What the crap.

<DashWithRainbows> Nope.
<Chrysalis> but the early power readouts
<thelonepony> Kawaii_icybeauti: i need it, want it
<Chrysalis> look like ZPMs
<Shizuka> 13ikr
<DashWithRainbows> Because I'm not immature when it comes to names.
<cachi01|phone> I will miss naming my opponent douchebag :'(
<Blako> it is in the radme
<thelonepony> cachi01|phone: Me too :'(
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Spell it wrong.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I named my rival "Dickfak"
<Cades> yup
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: I always just named him something normal. :D
<Shizuka> 13walkman
<Shizuka> 13this series is aaaancient
<SpadeMagnes[School> Asshat
<Kawaii_icybeauti> That could work
<SpadeMagnes[School> Asshat fucking oak
<Gold_Demona> I was so happy when I made my purchase on Amazon, cuz I had like 15 bucks worth of points on my credit card. And the games had free shipping. :D
<Arcane> My Rival was always named Him Blue or whatever his corrisponding version was
<cachi01|phone> I always name my character bigdick or cachi :I
<Blako> I'm glad it works
<Dark_Horst> McDouche
<Kawaii_icybeauti> cachi01|phone: You could name him that
<cachi01|phone> Yay
<cachi01|phone> Bigdick vs Douchebag is best fight
<Blako> btw after closing the game there should be "stdout" file - check it if there are any errors
<Kawaii_icybeauti> It's just the obvious "Penis" "Shit"...All of those.
<Cades> ok
<Shizuka> 13everything's better with spinning
<Blako> in the *exe directory
<SpadeMagnes[School> Name him Smogon
<cachi01|phone> And i always name my first pokemon sex slave
<Dark_Horst> oooooooouuuuuuhh.... twirly
<cachi01|phone> Except in ponymon
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Imma go try that.
<Cades> nope, no errors

<Kawaii_icybeauti> I got to nimbasa city, and when you go back to castella, there's a girl who ALWAYS fights you, even if you've beaten her.
<Dark_Horst> who's rda again?
<Gold_Demona> I usually name my trainer Katana after my pok?mon OC, but for my Pearl Nuzlocke, my trainer's name is Dema. :D
<cachi01|phone> Arcane well....dittos are sexlaves
<Shizuka> 13richard dean anderson
<Shizuka> 13oneill
<Gold_Demona> Pretty sure I'm gonna just use Katana for White 2
<Dark_Horst> oh him
<Bronysith> how often does a pokemon game come out again?
<Cades> Does the shoot buttom work?
<Bronysith> like once every 5 years?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I started with snivy this time around. I had a samarott already.
<Blako> yes
<Dark_Horst> no wonder i couldn remember a role with those initials xD
<Gold_Demona> Every some number of years
<soulrider95> Afternoon everyone :)
<Chrysalis> also
<AJIsAwesome> I always named my pokemon after the japanese names.
<Chrysalis> hell yes for continuity
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, soulrider95. :)
<Blako> at least on my computer :D
<Chrysalis> they reuse this principle in 6 seasons
<Shizuka> 13earlier than that
<AJIsAwesome> I might use Oshawott this time. I used Snivy last time.
<Blako> it should be 6 on numpad
<Shizuka> 13they use it twice
<Cades> It's not working on mine :p
<Shizuka> 13first to blow up a sun
<Arcane> cachi01 I know hehe. I have a max IV shiny Ditto
<Chrysalis> they use it twice for the supergates
<Blako> ouch, do you have numlock on?
<soulrider95> Got me a new sound card :D
<Shizuka> 13oh yeah they do get a third one
<Cades> ok there we go haha
<Cades> it works
<Blako> :D
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Oh yeah, catch a magnamite before the second gym in the city. I literally took the gym with a magnamite that was a much lower lvel than the gym.
<cachi01|phone> Arcane make it have a baby with a random pokemon lol
<Shizuka> 13close the iris! we blew our budget already making the event horizon swirly!
<Chrysalis> it is stupidly expensive for them to do the gate effect wasnt it though
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I should name my ditto prostitute.
<Chrysalis> which is why they only go through once an ep
<Arcane> cachi01 I Used him to breed my entire team, so i could get MAX IVs on them all
<cachi01|phone> LOL
<Shizuka> 13and also why it's aaaalways stock footage :3
<Chrysalis> nothings quite as awesome as the supergate openings though
<Shizuka> 13^
<Zawan> aww how many eps been showed?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> So far, I named my pokemans viper,umi, and machinehed
<Shizuka> 13i should jump to the end of that ep just to show it
<Chrysalis> which time

<Blako> pause menu too?
<Dark_Horst> mckay is best atlantis character
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Is this about space? *has never seen the show*
<Dark_Horst> carson gets points for the accent though

<Blako> ok
<Fersure> Stallion_of_War: you forgot 'timey wimey'
<Arcane> I really like this show o:
<Fersure> Most people think of time as a strict progression of cause to effect.
<Fersure> When actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint
<Arcane> I used to watch if on sc fi channel
<Blako> great, now just to decide what to make now, maybe butterflies
<Fersure> It's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey.... stuff...
<Stallion_of_War> Fersure: Ahh, it is time, not causality,
<Fersure> do not question my knowledge of doctor who.
<Fersure> pls.

<cachi01|phone> Im going to cosplay as tom
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Don't forget the sonic screwdriver
<Stallion_of_War> "I recognize that the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid-plot decision, I've chosen to ignore it."
<Fersure> Where is bronycon going to be next year?

<DashWithRainbows> kk
<Shizuka> 13it was withstanding the pull until now
<DashWithRainbows> not mine anyways
<Jmo> Who owns it?
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: looked like it at least dampened it though. that, or the wormhole picked the luckiest moment to kick another foot in
<Shizuka> 13well yeah, plot
<ekips> so why is the gate pulling everything in?
<Stallion_of_War> HEY STARGATE! BITE MY SHINEY METAL BOMB!
<Shizuka> 13the iris is placed like a micrometer in front of the event horizon, normally prevents particles from forming
<DashWithRainbows> It's Dari's sand castle
<Jmo> Oh sweet
<Chrysalis> Tealc vs black hole
<Chrysalis> tealc wins
<Chrysalis> hes so bad ass
<Dark_Horst> it's moments like those whenn you're happy you brought an alien mucle-dude home from your missions
<DashWithRainbows> he dampened the sand with the tears of other children
<Stallion_of_War> The bomb should have, ohh, time's slowing down
<Shizuka> 13and then they all died, the end

<Jmo> Continue on.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, QuinnThePegaSistta! :)
<Shizuka> 13my thinking is the iris was strong enough to withstand multiple Gs coming from the wormhole, and was holding up well until that last shard of glass/rope
<Dark_Horst> blackhole, time dilation effect due to gravity
<Dark_Horst> that, ekips
<QuinnThePegaSistta> hows it going AJIsAwesome

<Lyra`> nothing :3
<SpadeMagnes[School> Hah
<Amu-chan> How are you doing?
<prince-dari> Hahahaha
<Iron_Edge> If only if only...
<Everlasting_Joy> That was so much fun!
<Stormy`> I am frustrated with CSS >_>
<Stormy`> And I have a paper due at midnight tonight
<Stormy`> plus tons of other work
<Amu-chan> Oh...
<AJIsAwesome> So they're all going through the "groundhog day" loop?
<Everlasting_Joy> Lagtacular.
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome, yes.
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks. :)
<flutter_spin> AJIsAwesome: only the two know of it
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks, flutter_spin. :)
<Lyra`> XD
<Kandarihu> Only O'Neil and Teal'c were experiencing the loop.
<Sumica> 00,1010 hour loop actaly
<Lyra`> i want groundhog day rules for a day in new york
<prince-dari> Do we wever find out why only O'Neil and Teal'c remember?
<Lyra`> id have SOOO much lacivious activities :D
<Sumica> 00,10because they were on the alter when it actvated
<Cades> hi amu
<Shizuka> 13daniel got zapped, carter was tending to him, jack and teal'c went to grab archeologist hitler here
<Lyra`> because ones black, and the other has moxxy
<Amu-chan> Hi Cades!
<Iron_Edge> hitler??
<Dark_Horst> prince-dari: they were at the control altar with the other guy when the lighting went aöö wonky
<Shizuka> 13so they three are the ones outside the loop
<prince-dari> Ahh
<prince-dari> Ok
<Kandarihu> Malachai (who totally isn't Hitler) is also timelooping.
<Lyra`> that reference :D
<SpadeMagnes[School> HAH
<Lyra`> love it!
<SpadeMagnes[School> His wife is ill
<Stormy`> So now that people are here
<Stormy`> I was thinking
<SpadeMagnes[School> Or that...
<Stormy`> What would you guys think about moving #spyrochat to a different network?
<SpadeMagnes[School> You insane fool
<Stormy`> since this one is pretty much dead
<Lyra`> he has tenacity!
<Lyra`> he can do it!
<Shizuka> 13dude if the race that built the GODDAMN STARGATES couldn't do it
<Shizuka> 13don't think you can
<Lyra`> those ancients were just quiters!
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<SpadeMagnes[School> People having the same shitty cereal
<Stormy`> probably wouldn't happen, just a thought
<Iron_Edge> SpadeMagnes[School: Oh god.....
<SpadeMagnes[School> People spilling hot coffee
<SpadeMagnes[School> MASS HYSTERIA
<Iron_Edge> SpadeMagnes[School: Your describing a world I do not wish to live in....
<Sumica> 00,10he dont have the genes for it Shizuka
<Cades> Would that make a difference?
<Lyra`> then he'll be sad again :D
<Lyra`> I KNOW
<Cades> To the amount of people that would come here I mean
<Amu-chan> Not sure how much of a difference it would make. I don't think the activity of the network will change how much of the member-base joins the channel.
<Stormy`> I don't really know
<Stormy`> like right now the channel is just sitting here in nowhereland
<Kandarihu> I just noticed something. SG-12 came back 3 days early from a planet named Alaris, which was one of the affected planets. During some of the loops in which O'Neil and Teal'c were goofing off, they were hitting golf balls into an open stargate TO Alaris.
<Shizuka> 13eeyup
<Stormy`> so no one ever finds out about it except by word of mouth
<Shizuka> 13but they come through shortly after the loop starts so no chance of a weird paradox of the golf balls causing the injury they come back for :3
<Stormy`> I don't know much about the behavoir of users of other networks, so I don't know if anyone would come in and look at a new channel
<Cades> Well if it means that there's a higher chance of people coming here, then I'm cool with it.
<Lyra`> he forgot a few tries
<Lyra`> just saying.
<Lyra`> OATMEAL!
<Stormy`> it's not doing us any favors to be here, that's for sure
<Iron_Edge> Oh hell no!
<Cades> true
<Buytoast> haha
<Iron_Edge> I cant eat fruit loops over and over and over and over again >.>
<Shizuka> 13and now we'll never know what DANIEL would do if given an infinite time loop
<Lyra`> i can eat 12 bowls of cerial!
<Saturn> 08,01HOLY FUCK MY FAVOURITE EPISODE!
<Shizuka> 13mmm oatmeal~
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Saturn> 08,014x03 Window of Opportunity
<Lyra`> oof~
<Buytoast> 4X06
<Lyra`> i'd keep going on that for years
<Saturn> 08,01you sure?
<Buytoast> at least that's what the box said
<Lyra`> i SO want an endless time loop!
<Buytoast> well
<Buytoast> the bottom text
<Lyra`> i could know EVERYTHING!
<Buytoast> oh boy
<Chrysalis> thanks for the stream Sumica
<Buytoast> canned bread
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<Chrysalis> Shizuka*
<Lyra`> oh god.
<Chrysalis> samn tab fail
<Chrysalis> damn*
<Bronysith> Shizuka: have i ever told you how much i love you?
<AJIsAwesome> Chrysalis: She's not done. :D
<Shizuka> 13oo i can do this?
<Saturn> 08,01ah, it's numbered wrong on my dvd set
<Everlasting_Joy> Yay! Some good SBSP.
<Saturn> 08,01i have the cheap chinese version
<Chrysalis> yes, but i dont watch spongebob
<Lyra`> ahah
<Shizuka> 13oh no it just squishes it
<Chrysalis> so for me, the stream is over
<Kandarihu> But there's no indication of when in the loops they were doing that. I think SG-12 encountered some ill-justified hostilities from the people there. So O'Neil and Teal'c asked for permission to get back at them.
<AJIsAwesome> Chrysalis: Okay.
<Lyra`> sand bob.
<Shizuka> 13hrm
<Everlasting_Joy> "Improved Squidward's day yet!" Improved. . . Right.
<Lyra`> gloryhole?
<AJIsAwesome> Lyra`: .........

<Iron_Edge> Lyra`: I enjoy that you enjoy them.

<Amu-chan> That can happen with IRC bots... >->
<Kjakings> 7and the channel was /always quiet/
<MadSurge> We should have mods streaming only horror movies/cartoons/live action series for the occasion :D
<Stormy`> Not always :(
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Michael> ^^
<Kjakings> 7and the channel was /largely_quiet/
<Obsidian> brb gotta change computers

<AJIsAwesome> Still need to see that one.
<MadSurge> Iain: I'm not a gun nut, sorry :( I prefer old weapons
<Cranberry_Scotch> Next year we should celebrate Shark week by streaming different shark-based movies all week long

<twilight_sprinkle> and here i thought the ep wouldnt end in sex
<Stormy`> I thought he was getting unfunny anyways

<shuddup> i would love to see that....except shoot him with a tank, minigun or RPG
<Stormy`> Basically he took clips from the Land Before Time movies and put stupid youtube humor and "adult" jokes into them
<Cades> Did jittery dragon just commentate over the show or something?
<Cades> ah ok
<SirGanjalf> I wonder what happens if you cut his head off.
<Panda> >.>
<mentallyeffedguy> all this killing, and dumping of bodies
<twilight_sprinkle> its a power ranger

<Amu-chan> The bot itself did a lot. The specific script I'm thinking of is actually similar to what Steve does, except it has separate databases for different members, and anyone on the same channel as the bot could add quotes to the database.
<Lunar_Brony> Dark_Horst per disk, or the entire stack?
<Dark_Horst> no idea
<Lunar_Brony> sub06905 KILL IT! KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!

<Lunar_Brony> it is
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905: :|
<Amu-chan> It was a good thing the bot had the quotes separated, because there were quotes from a bunch of different networks, and not all of them were entirely appropriate for the community the channel was for.
<twilight_sprinkle> i knew someone would link it after i said id kill them

*twilight_sprinkle whistles at Lunar_Brony
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: :(
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: Just kidding. :D
<otakon> hiya guys what's up>?
<Lunar_Brony> hmm, maybe if I PM him directly so he wouldn't be able to ignore it . . .
<Shizuka> 13single take btw
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, otakon. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> ohai otakon
<thelonepony> hi otakon :)
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: we all know raritys the worst
<AJIsAwesome> Single take? Nice.
<Shizuka> 13and without the music playing while i recorded
<scout19_tf2> hey otakon
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: that won't work
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: *fluttershy
<Lunar_Brony> damn
<RDash5000> WAZZUP!?
<Dark_Horst> i once found a seed that would generate an awesome canyon landscape. but i forgot it
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, RDash5000. :)
<Lunar_Brony> RDash5000 WAZZUP!!!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Shizuka, do you time when you record the videos in Minecraft?
<Shizuka> 13actually it was the second time i tried i think, first run failed in expression
<otakon> Shizuka: so thinking of redoing your old video in GLORIOUS HD instead of summer squash?
<Randomnerd> Hey, otakon
<scout19_tf2> hey RDash5000
<Shizuka> 13wut
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: which texture pack are you using?
<thelonepony> Hi RDash5000
<Lunar_Brony> summer squash?
<Shizuka> 13painterly
<otakon> Shizuka: sorry bad joke
<RDash5000> so much lag!
<otakon> nvm
<otakon> RDash5000: do NOT complain about lag
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: NO, NO, NO, NO :O. YOU TAKE THAT BACK!!!!
<AJIsAwesome> You were locking out a chicken? :D
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: nope
<Shizuka> 13otakon: so thinking of redoing your face in GLORIOUS HD instead of summer squashed by pool noodle?
<ASoftFluffyThing> OOOOOOOOOOOOH BUUUUUURN!
<Shizuka> 13yeah on the first run there was a chicken on the roof
<Lunar_Brony> oh snap
<otakon> Shizuka: WHAT? I keed I keed! :D
<Blaine> HA! Better have burn heal!
<Shizuka> 13but anyway that's what happens when shizu records, things time perfectly without trying too hard
<ASoftFluffyThing> Blaine, I don't think a graft would cure that burn
<otakon> he left
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: have you even seen flutterwonder?
<Blaine> ASoftFluffyThing: :D
<StinkomanFan> STREAM SCARY THINGS
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: got a seed for that world or was it random generated
<CrimsonPhoenix> superretroworld, who hasn't
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: dont think i have
<ASoftFluffyThing> I noticed that in both of your Minecraft videos it's raining. Unless you managed to time the weather to a T
<superretroworld> Shizuka: holy shit your good at minecraft
<Shizuka> 13was 1.7.3, 'Sakura'
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, you don't know PinkiePieSwear?
<Dark_Horst> gonna try that
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: dont think so
<CrimsonPhoenix> duuuuude
<CrimsonPhoenix> You're missing out
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: well youll might change your mind if you watch it
<sub06905> Shizuka: what game is this?
<Shizuka> 13tonight on bronystate, shizu's catalog of videos, cause we got nothin else to stream today >>
<sonicdude558> Trackmania
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: doubtful because it isnt canon
<AJIsAwesome> Loop-de-loos!
<Shizuka> 13and now you know where this shot came from
<ASoftFluffyThing> All the loops!
<sonicdude558> Shizuka do us a favor and stream this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP7k-3Tipp4
<CrimsonPhoenix> wait a sec
<Kandarihu> Trackmania!
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: what do you mean canon?
<AJIsAwesome> No video links during stream. :)
<sonicdude558> fuck
<CrimsonPhoenix> superretroworld, have you really said that Rarity is worst?
<Kandarihu> Track! Track! Shizu's a Trackmaniac!
<Shizuka> 13yeah not cool sonicdude558...
<superretroworld> CrimsonPhoenix: YES
<Shizuka> 13this one i actually made >>
*sonicdude558 over reacts and hides in a corner
<otakon> sonicdude558: -_-
<Shizuka> 13took like sixteen hours... way too much detail you'll never see when running it
<CrimsonPhoenix> superretroworld, I would beg to differ
<otakon> I HEAR FALLOUT 3 MUSIC!
<Dark_Horst> DID AH JUST HEAR FALLOU!
<otakon> yes you DID
<SirGanjalf> Fallout
<Shizuka> 13and yes
<Shizuka> 13and it's set to the track music as well
<Dark_Horst> aw, jsut the soundtrack
<Cranberry_Scotch> I hope Hasbro keeps their promise and brings Trixie back
<thelonepony> FALLOUT 3!
<Lunar_Brony> I should play the Fallout games sometime
<Shizuka> 13the intro is supposed to be synced but usually falls out of sync due to level loading
<Kandarihu> Man, I can't read all of this text
<otakon> Shizuka: you ever play FO3?
<Shizuka> 13uh ja
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: well as im understanding this flutterwonder is something fanmade, so i doubt itll change my opinion on the character
<DaringDerpy> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Shizuka, how many hours did you put into your Minecraft? Because I totally envy you :3
<Shizuka> 13only finished main quest once, very bland game
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: yes do that, seriously. If your PC can run it get GOTY of Fallout 3
<Shizuka> 13as for minecraft, i abuse worldedit, so usually a few days
<Dark_Horst> man... i remmember launcing fallout 3 back in the day. i'd always sit there looking at the menu scren, listening to that beautiful epic soundtrack
<otakon> Shizuka: >_< what about New Vegas?
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, I would agree with you on that but I have to say that music is awesome
<ASoftFluffyThing> I've never tried worldedit........
<Dark_Horst> THEN i would start the game
<Lunar_Brony> otakon I have a major problem, though
<Shizuka> 13crashed on me, looks like looots more of the same...
<Lunar_Brony> I'm broke
<Shizuka> 13which is oblivion minus color
*sonicdude558 gets up from hiding
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: true, but lets not forrget Beep Beep
*sonicdude558 walks back to his computer
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: is that the trippy thing where she follows some lights in everfre forest?
<Shizuka> 13that's the track the signature was designed for btw
<Brad__> so was the whole south park brony episode thing a hoax or whats going on with that?
<Lunar_Brony> there is $0.11 in my Steam wallet and $2.37 in my IRL wallet
<Shizuka> 13WMP loves screwing this up
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, nah that's the garden
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: oh ok
<CrimsonPhoenix> flutterwonder is a classic brony song
<otakon> Shizuka: are you kidding? NEw Vegas is a LOT more colorful in many ways then Fallout 3 you should give it a shot if you can.
<Cipher> 0,14...I almost thought that was something out of KOF13 from the opening
<SirGanjalf> Shizuka: Except it's not made by Bethesda.
<sonicdude558> Sorry about that link guise... I gotta read the rules I guess :(
<twilight_sprinkle> oh, Thats flutterwonder, now i remember it. eh, its ok, but i dont find it amazing
<otakon> Cipher: ofc you would think that
<superretroworld> CrimsonPhoenix: sunshine and celery stalks is great too
<sonicdude558> also, OW MY EYES 2FAST
<CrimsonPhoenix> sonicdude558, you're not the only one don't worry
<otakon> sonicdude558: you haven't read the rules yet?
<DeadpoolDash> New Vegas made me feel like I was playing one of the original Fallouts
<sonicdude558> no
<SirGanjalf> Shizuka: But by Obsidian(which automatically raises it up in my ranking)
<CrimsonPhoenix> superretroworld, PinkiePieSwear is overall sweet
<Kandarihu> Man, awesome stuff here
<superretroworld> Brad__: really?
<Lunar_Brony> $10 for Fallout 1, $10 for Fallout 2, $10 for Fallout 3, and $30 for New Vegas
*Jmo slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
<DashWithRainbows> oi
<CrimsonPhoenix> wait 10 for fallout3?
<DeadpoolDash> Fallout 3 just felt out of place to me in the series
<sonicdude558> I do know one rule: Don't spam 3 messages every second or kick
<Shizuka> 13hm
<Shizuka> 13let's find out...
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: dude Fallout 1 is a MUST BUY and you can get it cheaper
<CrimsonPhoenix> I've been thinking on playing it....
<Lunar_Brony> I don't even have $5
<Jmo> lulz
<DashWithRainbows> dafuq u think u doin', Joomay?
<Lunar_Brony> otakon where?
<Jmo> not u dat4u
<Jmo> sure
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: hold on finding it now
<Lunar_Brony> k thx
<DashWithRainbows> oh...
<DashWithRainbows> kk
<Shizuka> 13fair warning
<Dark_Horst> what really rustles my jimmies is that until today noone managed to make an actually good fallout texture pack for mc
<Brad__> superretroworld, according to IMDB season 16 episode 1 was supposed to be called "my little brony", but it ended up being a different episode instead, so im wondering if they are going to move it to another episode this season
<Shizuka> 13it's usually pretty boring to watch
<VenHur> Shizuka, I also plays Trackmania in case you haven't known yet...
<Kandarihu> Hmm, Fallout 3 GotY is $20
<VenHur> Just a bare fact.
<superretroworld> Brad__: that will be an interesting episode
<Jmo> How long did it take for dabi to come back dwr?
<Dark_Horst> Kandarihu: when they do special offers it gets even cheaper, you wouldnt believe how much game you get there for your money
<Brad__> superretroworld, totally, if it actually happens :P they usually write the episode a week before it airs.
<sonicdude558> I have found a duplicate of the same rule
<sonicdude558> *a
<VenHur> So, in case if you want, we can race sometime...
<VenHur> ...Maybe.
<Kandarihu> Dark_Horst, I know. I'm kicking myself for not getting those games during the Summer Sale
<Dark_Horst> Kandarihu: but really... you should get that game. the goty edition is the basegame plus all addons. that is so much addiction for so few moneyz!
<Cretor> is the stream on?
<DashWithRainbows> Joomay he took hours
<AJIsAwesome> Yep
<Dark_Horst> Cretor: it is
<DashWithRainbows> he wus cryin'
<Kandarihu> And that Hearthfire DLC for Skyrim makes me REALLY want that game now.
<superretroworld> POP POP
<DashWithRainbows> and stoof
<Cretor> got it to work
<Shizuka> 13hm
<scout19_tf2> lets watch bathboys: clone
<DashWithRainbows> jk he came back about 20 mins later or something.
<Jmo> Rofl
<Dark_Horst> that reminds me of how i still have to get the addons for my skyrim
<VenHur> Shizuka: I think pink or red's your favortie color, isn't it...?
<Dark_Horst> totally slept over that
<VenHur> *favorite
<Shizuka> 13bleh come on stupid game...
<Dark_Horst> what is it you're trying to launch?
<Cretor> Can we watch some mlpytps like i suggested yesterday? I cant find any new ones that are worth watching.
<Kandarihu> I see Shizuka runing Trackmania United Forever, so I launch my Nations Forever. But Steam is converting content
<VenHur> So who wants to be in my Trackmania buddy list?
<SirGanjalf> Kandarihu: Why? There are mods for that stuff. (Except if you have console version - then there was no question)
<Kandarihu> That's what it says
<AJIsAwesome> Cretor: Just letting you know, they'll request videos to play.
<AJIsAwesome> Sometimes.
<sonicdude558> Okie Dokie, I read the rules.
<AJIsAwesome> Cretor: So you're better off waiting until then.
<Cretor> Gotcha
<AJIsAwesome> I've never seen Shizuka play this game before. This is SO AWESOME! /)^3^(\
<Shizuka> 13lul
<Shizuka> 13i am so out of practice
<Cretor> AJIsAwesome not quite sure what you mean though 6_9
<VenHur> He does it rarely, I also plays Trackmania too.
<Lunar_Brony> I think I understand some of this
<AJIsAwesome> Cretor: They'll open a request channel where you can put in your requests.
<Lunar_Brony> If you run into a wall, or fly off the track, you restart
<VenHur> Shizuka: That's okay, I'm always out of pratice too, since because i'm a novice in Trackmania.
<sonicdude558> odd, Shizuka's stream setup is more pixelated that Saturn's
<Shizuka> 13well
<Shizuka> 13this is 1024x768
<AJIsAwesome> CHOCOLATE!!!!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dat CHOCOLATE
<CrimsonPhoenix> dem bumps
<Shizuka> 13mixing down to 640x480
<Shizuka> 13at maximum graphics
<sonicdude558> The video gets garbled when there is moving video
<AJIsAwesome> We must go to plaid.
<Kandarihu> sonicdude558, different issue. Shizuka's game has so much motion that the video has to be EXTREMELY compressed to go out to mips at a bitrate that most of us can handle.
<sonicdude558> ah thats the word. Compressed
<VenHur> Shizuka wants your chocolate...ALL OF THEM
<Kandarihu> Saturn's computer tends to lag a lot.
<Shizuka> 13yeah if you guys think it's blurry for stream
<Shizuka> 13just picture me having to react to this....
<CrimsonPhoenix> Shizuka do you have a Rainbow Dash car?
<Cretor> What? What are they selling?
<Shizuka> 13i have no idea how many replays it took for me to finish
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: i've not been streaming for the last... hour or so?
<Cretor> how do i get this game?
<sonicdude558> idk I have never played it
<AJIsAwesome> Steam, I think.
<sonicdude558> I would do a simple search on Trackmania
<Ponies47> Chocolate!
<sonicdude558> Hi Ponies47
<Cretor> sounds goo.
*sonicdude558 glomps Ponies47
<Cretor> good*
<Kandarihu> Saturn, begging your pardon. It was merely my observation based on when I saw you streaming.
*Ponies47 Huggles sonicdude558 in return
<sonicdude558> dang. 11 minutes till bed.
<otakon> hiya Saturn how ya feeling today?
<Cades> time to start working on that biography :/
<Cretor> why does MSI play over and over again?
<Shizuka> 13it's the track song
<Shizuka> 13you can set a custom song for your track
<Shizuka> 13anyway, let's see mah car
<sonicdude558> I bet its epik
<sonicdude558> ooooo
<Kandarihu> Ah, the perks of United
<sonicdude558> smexy
<CrazyHippie> hi guys
<Cretor> Nice, i would have a really long one like masture of puppets if i where you

<CrazyHippie> Dose warm colurz!
<Shizuka> 13my rule for making the trackmania videos is A) i would use a fresh replay to get the most recent skin
<Shizuka> 13and B) i had to beat my previous best
<Shizuka> 13as you can imagine, that firebrand track took me FOREVERRRRRR
<VenHur> Forever?
<CrazyHippie> 4 ever
<VenHur> That's means....FOUR evers!
<Lunar_Brony> gasp
<CrazyHippie> :O
<sonicdude558> Wow, now I learned that $5 Lumber supports are a piece of junk.
*pony_960577 GraceNote

<SirGanjalf> twilight_sprinkle: They're not lesbian really
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: yep, at least that used to be their image back in the day
<AJIsAwesome> AH.
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<Kandarihu> I wonder if the game would look better on the steram if Shizuka would be willing to turn the game resolution down to 640 x 480
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, you're talking about Tatu?
<brony2447> Cretor: 193.35.57.25:25588
<Cretor> ill do it some other time brony2447 my computer cant handle bronystate and mincraft at the same time
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: yes
<brony2447> Cretor: aww, come on :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> I kinda loved those a bit
<Shizuka> 13not really
<sonicdude558> Am I hearing what I think I'm hearing? "Not near the courtyard"
<Shizuka> 13at 640x480 on a 1440x900 screen
<Shizuka> 13it's unplayable
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, sorry. I see
<Shizuka> 13also you're hearing "nas ne dogonyat"
<superretroworld> Cretor: minecraft is laggy on my computer :[
<SirGanjalf> twilight_sprinkle: It was just a marketing gimmick, back when people were "shocked" by this:P

<otakon> brony2447: dude, PM that next time
<Lunar_Brony> Eddmario yeah, I wouldn't even if I did. I feel like it's treating the player like a complete Minecraft noob, automatically filling out crafting recipes and warning you when you dig straight down or straight up.

<flutterchu> *bleeds from cookies he/she is eating
<SirGanjalf> Godsmack - Chocolate, got it
<SirGanjalf> but, srsly?
<AJIsAwesome> flutterchu: I thought I patched up your bleeding.
<flutterchu> AJIsAwesome: a patch cant clear an uppercut
<StinkomanFan> >Mute this
<StinkomanFan> >Play City Escape
<StinkomanFan> ((The song))
<Cretor> Im not sure the name of the song SirGanjalf but all godsmack songs sound the same so you can just listen to anyone of them.
<StinkomanFan> It feels so amazing
<Cades> "working"
<AJIsAwesome> flutterchu: Never underestimate the powers of patching.
<flutterchu> huh?
<Kandarihu> Man, it would be great if we could just all get on a single Trackmania server.
<Cretor> Thatd be cool
<AJIsAwesome> So much chaos on the track. :D
<VenHur> AJIsAwesome: Discord made that track.
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<SirGanjalf> if wonder if my pc could easily handle 100+ cars on a single track
<AJIsAwesome> I knew it. :D
<SirGanjalf> Speed of Chocolate:O
<flutterchu> no one signed up on my camp today :(
<AJIsAwesome> DAT TURBO
<Cretor> flutterchu: camp?
<SirGanjalf> Almost as fast as Ludicrous Speed
<VenHur> The plot of the game: One day, Shizuka sees a car made of chocolate, it was SO tasty looking that he raced it to this day, The End!
<flutterchu> Cretor: not what you really think but i dont want to talk about it
<Cretor> :( but i wanna know
<AJIsAwesome> BFDI Camp?

<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<flutterchu> Cretor: um.....im...sorry...um...no
<AJIsAwesome> It's BFDI camp, right?
<Cretor> Shizuka should read us cupcakes.
<flutterchu> AJIsAwesome: um..yes
<flutterchu> y-yes
<AJIsAwesome> flutterchu: Got it right!

<Cades> ok. NOW it's time to start
<AJIsAwesome> I think it stands for Battle For Dream Island, I think.

<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: WUT? :D
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: season 1 opening http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EwggOWkdo
<SirGanjalf> Chocolate cars would be a serious danger to the traffic - not because of temp. or sth, but because of drivers eating them slowly instead watching the road
<AJIsAwesome> No vid links during stream, flutterchu. :)

<otakon> eeyup Rustymeat
<superretroworld> 'remember, i died for your sins!'
<SirGanjalf> AJIsAwesome: Or delete entire WINDOWS folder. I mean, you're already using Windows - why would you need a folder for it?
<otakon> more like our entertainment
<AJIsAwesome> SirGanjalf: :D
<Kandarihu> Rustymeat, what could this possibly be other than Trackmania? ... or Trackmania 2?
<Cretor> I don't even verb.
<AJIsAwesome> Wut?
<Rustymeat> Yeah that was kind of a dumb question
<Kandarihu> Well, your guess was spot on
<Lyra`> i forgot i made tea
<Lyra`> and it was sitting on my nightstand
<VenHur> Shizuka: Have you heard of Trackmania 2 yet?
<Lyra`> and now its cold :(
<Shizuka> 13yes it sucks

<Shizuka> 13it also sucks
<otakon> Lyra`: seriously it's better than sweating into a puddle of humanity
<Jmo> Na, sweating is better.
<flutterchu> i liek fog....just not cold
<SirGanjalf> cold tea isn't good if you not intend it to be cold
<otakon> Lyra`: and I thought you Aussie's were tough.
<Lyra`> so, you dont like it when girls are in a puddle of sweaty humanity?
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVE it when it's cold. :D
<VenHur> Why you think that everything sucks, Shizuka?
<thelonepony> i like the cold :3
<SirGanjalf> coffee - not that bad
<flutterchu> (the teachers are starting to beleve im a lizard)
<Lyra`> i know what i spelled.
<Jmo> When it comes to cold weather, we hate it. lulz
<AJIsAwesome> It's around 55 degrees. Loving every second of it.
<Dken2021> Lyra` wha?
<otakon> Lyra`: that's different, haven't you seent hat commercial? Sweaty Girl= Hot, Sweaty Guy= Stinks, Sweaty big guy? disgusting. I'm the third catergory
<Rustymeat> Who else is exited for the new walking dead episode?
<Lyra`> im the first
<ASoftFluffyThing> I don;t lik cold tea. All I taste at that point is sugar.
<Shizuka> 13can't see anything capn ><
<Lyra`> :3
<flutterchu> heating up when youre cold > cooling off when youre hot
<Cretor> I just swalloed glass, on accident.. O_O
<Dken2021> ouch
<AJIsAwesome> Ouch...
<Cretor> It didnthurt but im scared
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ouch, Cretor. You might want to get to a hospital or doctor.
<VenHur> flutterchu: PLEASE don't remind me of that Pop Tart commercial, it doesn't made any sense.
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH BOY OH BOY Look at what Peta's been doing now http://i.imgur.com/CPRlM.jpg
<AJIsAwesome> You should tell someone about that.
<thelonepony> i think you should go to the hospital
<Rustymeat> dont move too much for the next hour
<Dken2021> think you'll be fine or do you think you need to go somewhere for that?
<Lyra`> Cretor, as long as it doesnt lodge itself inside your intestines
<Lyra`> youre fine
<ASoftFluffyThing> Like, right now.
<twilight_sprinkle> if youre cold you can at least warm up, but if its too hot and you dont have an ac, nothing will help
<Lyra`> unfortunatly
<Rustymeat> dont pirce your esophagus
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: EXACTLY!
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: WUT
<Lyra`> youre going to have to sift thru your stool from now on
<Cretor> Lyra': Ill keep that in mind. I chewd it up alot so ill be fine.
<Lyra`> about three days should be long enough to be sure.
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, I'm cureently playing the game
<otakon> you can only shed so much clothing until your naked and STILL sweating like you're on fire
<Lyra`> kk
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's hilarious
<Dken2021> Cretor was it from a broken cup?
<otakon> while you can bundle and warm yourself
<VenHur> CrimsonPhoenix: DEATH TO PETA!!
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, PETA. You idiots.
<Cretor> No a christmas lightbulb
<TheMaster> You swallowed glass? why would you do that?
<Jmo> HOW would youdo that.
<Dken2021> Cretor how did it managed to get to your mouth?
<Cipher> 0,14for a moment there, that looked like a Delorean
<ASoftFluffyThing> CrimsonPhoenix, can I kick PETA in the head? I'll leave some left for you to kick or punch. :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> Be my guest
<AJIsAwesome> Really wish PETA would try to stop doing these things. They're making themselves look worse than they need to be.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just think they're hilarious really
<Cretor> I was chewing on plastic i had on my bed and somhow one of these lights got on there then i heard a crunch.
<Dken2021> I haven't heard anything from PETA nowadays
<VenHur> First Cooking Mama...then Super Mario 3D Land...or Pokemon?
<TheMaster> PETA doesn't get donations and attention by being moderate and trying to have workable solutions towards animal issues
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Wait. Cooking Mama?
<TheMaster> they get money by doing crazy stupid things
<AJIsAwesome> They attacked Cooking Mama of all things?
<VenHur> I'm starting to think that Peta are trolling the video game industry.
<TheMaster> You should chew on pens like a civilized person from now on
<Rustymeat> oh yeah they also attacked super meat boy at some point
<Rustymeat> jesus
<AJIsAwesome> Super Tofu Boy. :D
<flutterchu> Cretor: youre gonna die....if you have brony freinds tell them to tell us about the message that you died (im SO SORRY http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/209/d/0/broken_heart_by_kurokaji11-d41zjrb.png i had to)
<CrimsonPhoenix> VenHur, oh you haven't seen the New Super Mario bros one?
<CrimsonPhoenix> with KFC?
<SirGanjalf> CrimsonPhoenix: http://www.halolz.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/halolz-dot-com-pokemon-letsfightourpetstothedeath-comic.gif
<VenHur> What's next, Peta making a My Little Pony flash?!
<Dken2021> Cretor well, if it were me, I would get that checked out just in case
<TheMaster> sounds about right
<CrimsonPhoenix> VenHur, funny you say that but I saw that flash in /mlp/ with the OP saying the same thing
<Dken2021> VenHur it's popular, it's all the talk over the internet, it's the perfect tareget
<Cretor> I was like sand when i swalloed and it wasnt alot because i spit out immediatley
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's one problem though
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's nothing in MLP for abuse
<TheMaster> why was it so far in your mouth that you could swallow it at all? Got to be more careful next time brah
<SirGanjalf> PeTA: Bronies are hurting real life ponies' feelings!
<Cretor> Hah okay
<Rustymeat> PEta will find a way
<VenHur> I mean, sure there's no animal abuse in the sh- *remembers Twilight getting injured by a piano and other things by Derpy* On second thoughts, never mind.
<flutterchu> nochangelings were harmed in the making of a canterlot weeding part 2
<Cypresswolf> :D Peta on Pokemon now - not sure if bigger low than their Tanuki Mario huff - and they didn't even bother mentioning the whole jumping on turtles :D
<TheMaster> So we're about 20-30 days away from season 3 right?
<TheMaster> whose excited?
<J_E_Smith> SirGanjalf: Speaking of Peta, they did another stupid Nintendo parody game, this time with Pokemon. You know "catching Pokemon is bad"
<otakon> ugh
<Dken2021> they're using pokemon as victims now?
<Shizuka> 13so yeah i made this track
<otakon> PETA is evil
<otakon> PETA IS EVIL
<Cipher> 0,14...did that car take off BTTF style?
<Shizuka> 13was not nearly this dark on the system i built it on though...
<otakon> do you KNOW what they do to pets?
<VenHur> Who have heard of the OTHER Peta by the way?
<otakon> They euthanize them outright?
<otakon> *.
<flutterchu> pika pi :'(
<TheMaster> They were caught euthanizing animals off the streets, yes
<otakon> They take perfectly adoptable pets
<otakon> and euthanize them
<AJIsAwesome> Wow.
<otakon> TheMaster: not only that but from SHELTERS too
<Kandarihu> I think I remember that on one recent occassion, I actually agreed with PETA on something. I don't remember the details, but I think it involved ACTUAL animal abuse.
<SirGanjalf> J_E_Smith: Only PeTA's game i've heard about til then was Super Tofu Boy
<JRP> Charrrrrrrilllllleeeee
<Dken2021> anyways, how is this game? you customize tracks and whatnot?
<flutterchu> otakon: what does euthanize mean?
<otakon> TheMaster: and these weren't diseased, condemned old animals, they were perfectly healthy.
<TheMaster> meh. There are a lot of dogs and cats. They arn't going to go extinct and as long as they're not torturing them then whatever.
<otakon> flutterchu: kill
<Cypresswolf> The other Peta? People Eating Tasty Animals? that one? I love that group :)
<VenHur> PETA should NEVER bashes the Bronies, think of the ponyity if such a flash game is made!
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: :D
<Cipher> 0,14that car looks like a mix between a muscle car and a Delorean
<Cipher> 0,14I need it
<Rustymeat> well im gonna go play borderlands 2
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Rustymeat. :)
<otakon> Rustymeat: what system?
<Rustymeat> 360
<otakon> Rustymeat: if 360, add me. I'm otakon17
<thelonepony> bye Rustymeat
<TheMaster> People only care about dogs and cats because they look cute. At the end of the day they're animals. And animal shelters euthanize a lot of animals every day
<flutterchu> chaaaaa ,/)_(\
<Rustymeat> oh cool ill ad you then
<Shizuka> 13problem is the island cars are touchy as hell ><
<otakon> Rustymeat: I'm level 50 Gunzerker with Teh Bee and I can farm the last boss and Terramorphus
<VenHur> The Delorean mk ii? (Mark Two)
<TheMaster> I volunteered at a animal shelter actually. They had a crematorium and beleive me, I saw piles of euthanized dogs and cats. Perhaps not the best thing for a 12 year old to see but whatev
<Rustymeat> ah neat
<otakon> Rustymeat: srs, friend me. Tag is otakon17, we can play sometime this wekk
<brony2447> lol i just claimed a desert island for my faction for no reason :P
<Rustymeat> I heard the bee is aan op weapon
<otakon> *week
<Shizuka> 13this one i also made
<Rustymeat> im a lvl 40 gunzerk
<otakon> Rustymeat: not a weapon, amp shield. Used with a high pellet Shotgun it's OP
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU: eggs
<Rustymeat> it has no amp penalty right?
<otakon> Rustymeat: yeah I can help you level if you want to fifty off of the Warrior AND get you some selling loot and stuff for you when you hit 50 later on.
<otakon> Rustymeat: eeyup
<Cypresswolf> Dogs & Cats are just kept around for emergency food when things get bad - Have you learned nothing from Excel Saga?
<CrimsonPhoenix> >Peta Pokemon trading card
<TheMaster> thats how it was in the 40s anyway
<CrimsonPhoenix> so much hilarity
<VenHur> Shizuka: Do you play other racing games? Like say, Need for Speed, Burnout, or Gran Turismo?
<TheMaster> er 30s
<otakon> Cypresswolf: Poor dog...
<Rustymeat> right now im focusing getting all the challenges done
<Kandarihu> The whole saga with Super Tofu Boy turned out epically, though.
<Rustymeat> regions specificly
<otakon> Rustymeat: ah, well good luck. Challenges are best done in regular mode though
<TheMaster> i'm suprised nobody ever says poor cow or pig. But then again they are really delicious
<otakon> Rustymeat: at lv 50 you can more or less pull stuff off without dying
<Ryunosuke> is that... that racing game in Shizuka's outro?
<Kandarihu> Ryunosuke, eeyup
<VenHur> Yup.
<otakon> TheMaster: okay but they are bred for eating and I DO feel guilt and always thank my meat before I eat. But that's just me.
<Dken2021> TheMaster pfft, who cares about farm animals?
<flutterchu> pika pika pi pi pika pikachu (translation: im speakng pikachu so you all cant understand me)
<Cretor> because a cow or apig willnever love you
<Ryunosuke> ahh
<TheMaster> Only cute animals deserve to live
<otakon> no
<otakon> just no
<VenHur> flutterchu: Um...we can hear your thoughts you know.
<Ryunosuke> Track mania I take it?
<otakon> CHOCOLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE
<Starlight_Phoenix> Hey Shizuka. What do you use to play trackmania?
<otakon> Ryunosuke: eeyup
<Kandarihu> That CHOCOLATE scream is Shizuka's horn, right?
<Lunar_Brony> either chat derped or died
<otakon> Starlight_Phoenix: keyboard mouse ofc
<Dken2021> I didn't know fish can survive on land craving for sweets
<VenHur> Kandarihu: Yup.
<Ryunosuke> I cant read that tiny assed font in the corner :p
<Shizuka> 13isn't it obvious
<Shizuka> 13keyboard
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: you got derp
<Kandarihu> Nice horn.
<Ryunosuke> I read the banner
<VenHur> Keyboard is your horn?
<Lunar_Brony> otakon figured that
<VenHur> Or is it chocolate?
<Kandarihu> I'm gonna have to revert my ping if I'm gonna do my Pony Fast
<otakon> Kandarihu: pony fast?
<Dken2021> what kind of pony are ya doing?
<Cypresswolf> I wouldnt mind raising chickens again - havent had since I moved to college - got several for easter every year since I was a little tike. but they attracted all kinds of predators, hawks, dogs, sometime cats
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/4ApwQ.png My sides
<Starlight_Phoenix> Can you use a x360 or steering wheel?
<otakon> Cypresswolf: ugh I lived on a chicken farm. Smelled of hot mayo for 10 years...still like chicken though
<Shizuka> 13assume so
<Cypresswolf> longest we had a chicken was about 6 years,rooster actually, think a hawk got him
<flutterchu> :'(
<Shizuka> 13but controllers cost as much as a decent keyboard
<Starlight_Phoenix> I just assumed that you use a controller.
<Shizuka> 13and have about a hundred less buttons and usefulness
<otakon> Starlight_Phoenix: yh but why buy one when she can use the ky and mouse? Shizu is good with them
<Shizuka> 13i hate controllers
<Kandarihu> If Season 3 isn't going to premier by the time of the election, I might as well fast on watching anything related to MLP. I gotta fast on something.
<Cretor> i got a controller for 30$ shizuka
<Shizuka> 13this i also made
<Cretor> workes good for halo ce
<otakon> Shizuka: good for you, I hate using four fingers to try to move in diagonal directions
<otakon> I can't do movement on the keyboard
<otakon> there is no give
<Starlight_Phoenix> Your good.... at this Shizuka
<Kandarihu> I'll probably fast on gaming once the IGG Marathon is done.
<otakon> it's either full speed single direction or full stop
<Shizuka> 13that scoreboard
<Shizuka> 13is the world record for this track i made
<Shizuka> 13i think my best is 1:10
<Shizuka> 13so yeah >>
<otakon> Shizuka: nice :)
<AJIsAwesome> Nice.
<Lunar_Brony> I would whistle if I could
<AJIsAwesome> Same here.
<Lunar_Brony> I'm over twice as old as my sister and she can whislte

<AJIsAwesome> What was wrong with him?
<Cypresswolf> I think we had 3 parakeets actually - the first one was a brat, always tried to bite when you put your hand in the cage to change out the food/water dishes or clean its mirror
<Cypresswolf> that one flew out the door after it was left open
<Lyra`> he developed psychic and reality warping powers
<AJIsAwesome> I've ALWAYS wanted a parrot as a pet.

<Dken2021> allo Arcane_
<Arcane_> Guess what im playing
<Cranberry_Scotch> Like being able to open and test coasters without completing them, leading to very unique crashes
<StupidSexyCJ> Arcane_: pattycake?
<Jmo> Hello Kitty Online?
<Dken2021> Arcane_ is it something pokemon related?
<Arcane_> Yes
<AJIsAwesome> Arcane_: Hotel Mario?
<thelonepony> Arcane_: Pokemon black 2:3
<Jmo> OH

*Jmo slaps DoshWithReenbows around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> you chav.
<Dken2021> aha, I think I might get black 2 since white 2 doesnt' have hard mode, lame
<DoshWithReenbows> Shaddap
<AJIsAwesome> Dken2021: hard mode?
<Cranberry_Scotch> JMO, you like Boardgame-Online?

<Arcane_> Yeah Also its put on set battle mode kinda like when you play multi player
<twilight_sprinkle> Dken2021: wait so black 2 has hard mode but not white 2?
<VenHur> This game defys all physics and push them aside.
<Dken2021> twilight_sprinkle yea, white 2 instead has easy mode
<AJIsAwesome> That's unfair to people who bought White 2.
*Lyra` is watching justice league
<StupidSexyCJ> VenHur: you could say it kicks logic out and does the impossible
<Lyra`> and its AMAZING
<Dken2021> well you can transfer the modes via IR
<twilight_sprinkle> Dken2021: huh, thats new.
<Lyra`> even better the second time ^-^
<thisguy> it thrives on the impossible :P
<Dken2021> but you have to have someone else to have another copy, ie: no internet transfer
<[Alpha-Trinity]> should I ask?
<twilight_sprinkle> well that sucks
<twilight_sprinkle> well at least theres a hard mode at all, the easy grind fest was getting old
<AJIsAwesome> ^

<sonicandmario85> AJIsAwesome:im not one of them i only like G4 and G1
<flutterchu> i guess i can say that i like all gen's
<Ryunosuke> I thought we were talking abaout mlp
<Dken2021> well besides the surf route, nothing was wrong with gen 3, heck it introduced secret bases, which I wish they brought back
<flutterchu> exept 3.6
<DashWithRainbows> Lol, don't give a shit.
<DashWithRainbows> Pokemon > MLP
<DashWithRainbows> Anyday
<AJIsAwesome> I like all the gens. Gen 3 is one of my favorites.
<Jmo> Osnap

<Jmo> Hello Kitty > Pokemon
<flutterchu> DashWithRainbows: i thought you said you hated pokemon
<Jmo> sup DWR
<Ryunosuke> when I heard DashWithRainbows talkiing about G3, I thought he liked G3 mlp :p
<DashWithRainbows> I hate things in varying levels.
<flutterchu> DashWithRainbows: do you hate blood
<VenHur> I liked ALL the generations, but Ruby Version is where I started playing Pokemon in the first place.
<DashWithRainbows> Yes.
<Arcane_> About to Battle Slater

<DashWithRainbows> That's alright, mate.
<flutterchu> *gen 1 ash voice* ALL RIGHT
<VenHur> I can't wait for the Generation 3 remakes...
<AJIsAwesome> Ryunosuke: That's fine.
<DashWithRainbows> Gen 5 is not that bad as...
<Maid_RainBow> Ryunosuke why does that name sound so farmilare?
<DashWithRainbows> YES VenHur

<Kimori> Thats pretty expensive...
<VenHur> Might as well called the remakes "LavaRuby Version" and "SeaSaphire Version".
*Ryunosuke is old, GET OFF MY LAWN
<AJIsAwesome> Only thing I liked from Gen 4 was the physical-special-status split.
<otakon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBPdtMJwycA&feature=relmfu
<sonicandmario85> also by generation i though you meant MLP i like all the pocket monsters generations
<DashWithRainbows> The only thing I liked from Gen 4 was two more Eevee-lutions.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<AJIsAwesome> Well, that and Porygon-Z.
<Slater> Gen 1-5 <3
<AJIsAwesome> That thing is a monster.

<J_E_Smith> Though the new Lyoko will be live action in the real world
<RedDragonX> i have a couple of silver and red stamped two dollar bills from just before the great depression
<J_E_Smith> Dken2021: Well that's because they destroyed XANA in the next to last ep
<Dken2021> are the actors french?
<Shizuka> 13did sumica ever get through season 1
<Cranberry_Scotch> code Lyoko was always a french cartoon
<Shizuka> 13would not want to jump to season 3 with lost ponies
<Dken2021> iirc, don't think so
<flutterchu> why is the B movie created by Laura Faust
<Kimori> I have some mercury dimes and some silver certificates

<Dken2021> J_E_Smith I forget, but it was around the time William was XANA-possesed and them tryin to find aletia's dad
<Kimori> It sucked, its a bad time to sell stuff like that right now
<Ponies47> Invi: He just broke the disk in half because he's a jerk

<sub06905> i am $25 short on getting the game
<tSparx> Y'know, normally I like school, but I've missed the shit out of my bronystaters. How's everyone been?
<sub06905> ello tSparx :)
<DaringDerpy> http://huussii.deviantart.com/art/MLP-Banished-324738218
<sub06905> o.o
<andy> thats... pretty dark
<tSparx> DaringDerpy: Ooohhhh :(
<DaringDerpy> all she wanted was love
<sub06905> im so glad i bough my sonic screwdriver :>, i just checked the website and they are out of stock o.o
<sub06905> bought*
<Arcane_> Ugh why am i still not doing my project
<DaringDerpy> because lazyitis
<sub06905> because bronystate is distracting you :>
<DaringDerpy> creative avoidance
<tSparx> BronyState is equal and opposite to productivity
<Chrysalis> depends how you define productivity
<tSparx> School-related productivity, I should say
<Amu-chan> Nice timing me. XD
<SharkMane> Is there ANYthing showing in the stream?
<DaringDerpy> the circle of life
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The buffer show if that counts
<sub06905> Arcane_: http://derpface.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Ermahgerd-Merdern-Werferr.png
<Arcane_> My entire life depends on this project
<sub06905> errm wrong link
<Chrysalis> spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
<Arcane_> yet I cant bring myself to do it
<sub06905> http://thenewspatroller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Get-stuff-done-today.jpg
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sir Bufferson is fighting the dreaded buffer dragon
<DaringDerpy> then by the gods don't do it!
<DaringDerpy> with all your power
<Arcane_> Seee now im giggling
<Arcane_> Most def not gonna get it done
<SharkMane> Is there ANYthing showing in the stream?
<tSparx> Arcane_: Don't allow yourself to do anything else, and eventually your brain will find it more interesting than nothing
<tSparx> SharkMane: No.
<DaringDerpy> is this an actual language, sub06905`?
<sub06905> nope
<Amu-chan> I'm off then, later everyone! XD
<sub06905> :)
<Spectrum_Rush> sub06905: http://i.imgur.com/6Uu4o.jpg
<DaringDerpy> tSparx: this is how I get things done too. nothing else for the whole planned time. no matter if I do what I planned or not, but no other things allowed
<DaringDerpy> -no +doesn't
<DaringDerpy> usually I end up working as planned
<tSparx> DaringDerpy I usually have just enough discipline and skill to procastinate and get work done well at the last minute, but in desperate times, I will smoke and then not do anything else but work.
<sub06905> Spectrum_Rush: ah yes, i couldnt find that one
<tSparx> That only works, of course, if you can do good work and be high at the same time. But there is no boredom quite like high boredom.
<Spectrum_Rush> sub06905: save it just incase i lose it again, shame I still cnt find the other version ;A;
<DaringDerpy> smoking is a bad idea
<sub06905> what other version?
<DaringDerpy> can't concentrate when high
<tSparx> DaringDerpy: Maybe you can't. The first time I ever smoked I wrote a philosophy paper. Got an A+ on it.
<tSparx> DaringDerpy: I've not smoked dozens of times, I can work just as well high as I can not high -- no better, but no worse either.
<DaringDerpy> and you think you couldn't have done that sober?
<DaringDerpy> hm...
<tSparx> I've now* smoked dozens of times
<twilight_sprinkle> tSparx: oi, twilight wouldnt appreciate you smoking :I
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: I talk about my drug use all the time on here, how come I come back for the first free night I've had in weeks and people suddenly give me a hard time?
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: :P
<DaringDerpy> tSparx: I have smoked for eight years. Almost daily. Brought only problems.
<twilight_sprinkle> tSparx: cause smoking is bad
<tSparx> DaringDerpy: How do you afford that much? Christ.
<twilight_sprinkle> tSparx: and i think you were told that before
<DaringDerpy> I lived near the border. Lots of opportunities to make money. ;)
<DaringDerpy> and it was not too expensive. 300€ for 50g
<Spectrum_Rush> sub06905: instead of saying stuff done, I think it said 8 hours of sleep iirc
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: I've been hearing it all my life. You might consider it bad; the Rastafarians consider it a holy way to talk to God. I think God gave to us "every plant bearing fruit and every herb bearing seed," and that includes the cannabis plant -- especially if it includes the tobacco plant.
<sub06905> Spectrum_Rush: ah
<twilight_sprinkle> tSparx: so god wants you to smoke and screw up your lungs?
<twilight_sprinkle> tSparx: and screw with other aspects of your health, including thinking?
<SharkMane> http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2pazpy30L1r10378.png
<DaringDerpy> tSparx: you believe this? do you believe in tv ads too?
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: Cannabis has actually been shown to help against lung cancer -- now as a man of science I'll freely admit that there hasn't been enough study to make that *fact*, but it is theory.
<twilight_sprinkle> tSparx: tobacco, on the other hand, is known for screwing up lungs.
<DaringDerpy> yes yes, cannabis heals cancer, feeds the poor and brings world peace
<tSparx> DaringDerpy: I don't watch television; any shows I watch, I watch DVR'd.
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: And I don't smoke cigarettes.
<andy> well i got to go guys. see you all later
<tSparx> DaringDerpy: Nonsense.
<tSparx> DaringDerpy: Weed isn't holy. It's not evil either.
<DaringDerpy> that's what the addicts preach
<twilight_sprinkle> bye andy
<tSparx> Night andy
<DaringDerpy> bye andy
<sub06905> bai andy
<twilight_sprinkle> tSparx: you just mentioned tobacco. plus ive heard a lot of theories on how smoking helps, but all i see is addiction
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: I'm not gonna stop anyone from smoking tobacco, but I don't.
<twilight_sprinkle> tSparx: smoking other things is bad too, especially for your thinking. and its known to cause addiction
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: Psychedelic drugs don't have a method of physical addiction. That's not even far out there -- that's just chemical fact. And you can get mentally addicted to anything.
<DaringDerpy> I find the cannabis addicts funny. "Weed is not addictive! I just go out of my way for this stuff every single day because I have no reason not to!"
<tSparx> DaringDerpy: I haven't smoked in weeks. I have 1,300 dollars in my bank. I'm probably not an addict.
<DaringDerpy> probably not
<DaringDerpy> you risk an addiction by using it. always
<SharkMane> http://www.hilariousheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/funny-dogs-guns-photo-5.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> tSparx: so ive heard, but people who smoke it praise it too much to sound un-addicted.
<DaringDerpy> a mental addiction is an addiction
<PonyNegZero> any colt scout in here is probably thinking "wtf?"
<DaringDerpy> the effect is the same
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: DaringDerpy I'm done talking about this.
<SharkMane> WTF?
<DaringDerpy> poor dog
<Arcane_> o:
<twilight_sprinkle> tSparx: just know that its risky, and if you screw up your health or mind, especially as a scientist, youre screwed for life
<twilight_sprinkle> anyway i need to go now, night.
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: I'm not a scientist, I'm a theologian.
<Kinixys|afk> twilight_sprinkle: G'night!
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: I just appreciate the scientific method.
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: Night t-sprinkle :)
<Kinixys|afk> twilight_sprinkle: Sleep well.
<DaringDerpy> good night twilight_sprinkle :)
<Kinixys|afk> Scientific method, best thing ever invented.
<NocturnalBlade> nite twilight_sprinkle
<SharkMane> http://i.qkme.me/35n93j.jpg
<Moopy> WHOOP WHOOP!
<tSparx> Kinixys: Amen! Religion on its own worked for a while, but then people, especially my predecessors in the Catholic Church, overstepped the bounds of faith. Science put religion back in its place, and thank God for it.
<DaringDerpy> http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg78/evalana/blog%202/mlpfim_ep1513.png
<SharkMane> SCIENCE!!
<DaringDerpy> yay
<SharkMane> ... Who's in charge of the streaming?
<DaringDerpy> no one
<DaringDerpy> the stream is out of control
<DaringDerpy> usually the mods
<DaringDerpy> their asleep
<SharkMane> 0h!

<Spectrum_Rush> actually Ghosties is apparently the leader...
<SharkMane> Mods are asleep?

<SharkMane> NNN0000000OO!!!
*Spectrum_Rush dammit ArmaII install faster :<
<Kinixys> tSparx: I'm not sure what sort of balance could exist between the two. Scientific method is covering the material world rather well.
<DeathStar> DaringDerpy: like candle ja-wait nope not saying it!
*DaringDerpy installs fallout 3 goty
<tSparx> Kinixys: Science is about answering the questions we can. Religion is about answering the questions we can't. Or to put it another way, Science is about the how, Religion about the why.
<Moopy> Awwww shit the truth is going to reveal to the continue next yesssss WHOOP WHOOP!
<SharkMane> Muffins!
<DaringDerpy> Installation complete :)
<DaringDerpy> I'll be in my lab then

<DeathStar> Moopy: I don't think so...
<Moopy> Well then if i did i need a better computer
<Moopy> Wait i would be scared if i had a job like that
<DeathStar> the computer is usualy not the problem if you can't stream. it's the internet
<DeathStar> Moopy: why?
<Moopy> I don't know................i don't want to stream anything bad on the air
<DeathStar> worried about people judging your streams?
<Moopy> well ummm..................

<Moopy> Nooooooooooooooooooo!
<SharkMane> Sing for us!!
<XylemTube> WOOOO this song is awesome
<Kencolt> I would describe this as Furby gone wrong-- except Furby was never right in the first place.
<SharkMane> yay
<XylemTube> CUPCAKES
<SharkMane> CuPCAKES!!!! now 20% cooler!!

<Kencolt> Dead battery, Moopy .
<J_E_Smith> Problem with the voice chip?
<Moopy> Hey buddy change battries
<XylemTube> fsgfdvjhayfbviughjiuajrfukoi9ahfvhaedg
<RoboGerbil> might be low batteries?
<Sumica> 00,10not enough voltage
<pony_2978> I hope they programmed the three laws of robotics into this thing, otherwise wer are doomed
<Moopy> that was weird
<SharkMane> mindf@%*!!
<RoboGerbil> song seems familiar...
<Moopy> so where does pinkie keep her battries in?
<SharkMane> 0h NO!!!
<Spectrum_Rush> RoboGerbil: from Cave Story
<SharkMane> Where is this from?
<XylemTube> MY LEG
<Moopy> Uh oh
<Moopy> Oh derpy
<Kencolt> Moopy: Depends on the toy... one is.. wrong.

<pony_2978> AAARH
<Moopy> WTF
<pony_2978> So schlecht
<XylemTube> Pinkies sounds pissed off suddenly
<Moopy> Sumica...............you are so random
<Sumica> 00,10eeeyup
<Moopy> cool
<SharkMane> I speaky spanish :D
<XylemTube> something about cleaning stuff
<Kencolt> This is not a bad version at all.
<pony_2978> German dubbing is horrible
<SharkMane> Damn... I laughed.
<XylemTube> I understand what they are saying, I prefer the English version
<pony_2978> Aufhören!
<RoboGerbil> wow that german art of dress sux
<Kencolt> pony_2978: Germany is, sadly, notorious for poor dubbing and editing... the Zabuza in Naruto was especially infamous. The guy's whole thing was his giant sword-- the solution? Edit out the blade, so it looked like was attacking with a dildo.
<Moopy> See this is why i like you 2 guys Sumica and wrek you guys are my favorit guys on bronystate
<Sumica> 00,10oh?
<Kencolt> And I am NOT kidding.

<XylemTube> Been Dreamin' I've been waitin
<RoboGerbil> who made this crap list?
<Kencolt> RoboGerbil: Y9ou should hear the LOSERS.
<SharkMane> CRAP!?
<pony_2978> Kencolt: And I find it funny that so many people bitch about any dubbing of japanese anime other than anime, because most of the time they can not even have an opinion whether the japanese version is any good
<DeadpoolDash> so much ear rape
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Moo o3o

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02O3O
<DeadpoolDash> latino, lolz
<DeadpoolDash> Spanish
<SharkMane> Who else speaky spanish?
<XylemTube> Italian is ok\
<Sumica> 00,10inb4 italian op gets number one
<Kencolt> I USED to , years ago.
<RoboGerbil> they should do something in romanian
<RoboGerbil> or finnish
<Kencolt> Sumica: Yeah-- if you're going to change things, thattime they did it GOOD>
<pony_2978> I thought polish version would just be one dude speaking over the main audio, without any editing, lol
<XylemTube> Fuck shit stack
<Spectrum_Rush> saw this coming
<DeadpoolDash> The polish voices are nice
<Kencolt> Yay, Poland-- GOOD Va there.
<XylemTube> I really Like Frnch Flutterguy
<Spectrum_Rush> ikr
<SharkMane> AT THE GALA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02!!!
<Sumica> 00,10what a shock
<Kencolt> The Poles treat the source material with respect. I like that.
<XylemTube> WOOOOOOO
<pony_2978> I love how absolutely random the italian opening is
<Spectrum_Rush> can ya blame 'um sumi
<pony_2978> What were they thinking
<RoboGerbil> no subs?
<SharkMane> That's the opening for italian!?
<DeadpoolDash> so many spoilers in this opening
<XylemTube> ]THe italian opening is really good
<Kencolt> Sumi, don't you have a subbed version of the Italian OP?
<Sumica> 00,10not realy a spoiler with out context
<MadSurge> Well, that's one good way to come into Bronystate :D Hi guyyyys
<DeadpoolDash> still shows future scenes
<Sumica> 00,10wrong one
<pony_2978> In un mondo splendido - aaaand lag
<DeadpoolDash> the regular opening just has opening animation
<RoboGerbil> er.. they call it anime?
<DeadpoolDash> anime just means animation
<Spectrum_Rush> need link Sumica ?
<Kencolt> In Italy, Anime means the same thing as in Japan-- ALL animation/cartoons.
<SharkMane> YEAS
<Sumica> 00,10hmmmm guess so
<MadSurge> Kencolt: we just call anime "japanese cartoons"
<Kencolt> The Japanese refer to MLP as an anime. And comment heavily on fansubs.
<pony_2978> I watched Avatar - The Last Airbender completely in italian
<Sumica> 00,10cant seem to find the short opeing with lirics on local
<pony_2978> I am glad only the first half of the first season sucked
<Spectrum_Rush> oh was that the wrong one then Sumica ?
<MadSurge> pony_2978: well, glad we don't suck :D
<RoboGerbil> pony_2978: what was wrong with it? only the firt ep had animation errors
<Sumica> 00,10wrong launage Spectrum_Rush
<Spectrum_Rush> woops XD
<DeadpoolDash> for me the lowest part of the first season was the 2 part intro episodes
<pony_2978> RoboGerbil: I really didn't like the first half, I don't even know why
<MadSurge> Vola e va', my little pony, se nuovi amici vorrai incontrare
<pony_2978> But the 2nd and 3rd season were MUCH better
<pony_2978> And Toph alone was worth it, anyway
<XylemTube> This intro dose feel a lot more like anime....
<RoboGerbil> this the extended opening?
<DeadpoolDash> the avatar movie sucked ass
<Sumica> 00,10there
<pony_2978> XylemTube: No, for that this intro would need the Ponies running on a green field, and birds in the air
<SharkMane> .... which is this?
<pony_2978> XylemTube: And the mane 6 standing on the edge of a cliff, looking into the distance, hair flowing in the wind
<MadSurge> SharkMane: the short opening they actually use
<Kencolt> Holy-- it IS like an anime poening. It even had Random English.
<DeadpoolDash> wow steam really wants me to know X-COM is out
<RoboGerbil> wishbone?
<SharkMane> 0h...
<J_E_Smith> Whoa Amazing Stories
<Kencolt> AMAXING STORIES.

<RoboGerbil> could be anything.. even a pinkie ieacus
<MadSurge> Sumica: we need some Crypt Keeper for Halloween! :D
<Spectrum_Rush> Whatever we're gonna see is probably gonna be awesme
<SharkMane> HELL YEAS!!!
<DeadpoolDash> swamp thing would be awesome right now

<RoboGerbil> thats a scary mummy...
<DeadpoolDash> ...everything floats down here...
<Spectrum_Rush> now question is... why would there be a zombie in a swamp
<SharkMane> MAGIC!!!
<MadSurge> pony_2978: Lots of german ponies here :) (I'm Italian though)
<SharkMane> I'm part spanish!! :D
<Kencolt> And the director is an ass. This is no surprise. I have directed a play once myself, and I was an ass.
<Sumica> 00,10which part?
<pony_2978> I did take italian in school
<Kencolt> It comes with the territory.
<Sumica> 00,10exposision time

<Kencolt> MOst American are some sort of blend. With a few exceptions.
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: yeah basically
<Spectrum_Rush> XD

<MadSurge> We're not having a lottery this week?
*Gold_Demona does copy paste
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfaxquIn060
<DoctoDoctorWho> now?
<Ryunosuke> you know
<Gold_Demona> There we go. :3
<alexxm> bye guys
<TheKoreanBrony1354> botox doctors
<Gold_Demona> You leaving alexxm?
<Ryunosuke> I just had a terrifying though
<Ryunosuke> later alexxm
<alexxm> yeah i have college Gold_Demona
<TheKoreanBrony1354> alexmm bye
<DoctoDoctorWho> go on...
<Gold_Demona> Ah. ok. laters
<AdamTheDuck> Bye alexxm
<Gold_Demona> I need to go forage some breakfast. brb
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ryunosuke: Go on...
<Ryunosuke> Peta's dream world would in fact be equestria, no one dies, Animals are the rulers, NO ONE eats meat (except for maybe the occaasional carnivore)
<MadSurge> There is death.
<bicyclerepairman> no, being a carnivore is wrong
<DoctoDoctorWho> I eat meat...
<Ryunosuke> well there was that one time fluttershy fed fish to some otters or something :)
<bicyclerepairman> so do I
*AdamTheDuck noms on ded chat all the time... But is not sure what ded chat is made of... :<
<DoctoDoctorWho> bicyclerepairman: then why did u say that?
<Gold_Demona> I'm an omnivore. That's what my dna dictates I be. So it shall be.
*Spell-of-Gaming sighs on... ded chat
<Jmo> cottno candy.
<TheRandomkid321> I swear if that bloody kid pisses me off again tomorrow I will beat his face in. He is lucky his back was turned and he had his bag on today. Or I wouldve done it when he stole my favorite pen.
<Jmo> cotton*
<bicyclerepairman> I don't know if that's an official position by PETA, but there are some sick people who give their pets vegan food
<Spell-of-Gaming> GREATSCOTTon candy
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: good job, you won the logic, /)
<Ryunosuke> same here, I have fangs for a reason, it is not to tear apart lettuce leaves :)
<Jmo> That was abit eh
<Jmo> Plain
<Spell-of-Gaming> I hope PETA realizes raising pets can be animal abuse.
<bicyclerepairman> but you have the opportunity to change, Gold_Demona!
<Gold_Demona> The word "carnivore" implies you eat nothing but meat and cannot digest plant material.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: technically we can go on without meat, but meat is delicious :3
<bicyclerepairman> it's possible to not eat meat and survive, why don't you do it?
<Ryunosuke> which brings be back to my philosophy: everyone needs to eat more bacon :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> Humans are omnivores.
<MadSurge> ^
<TheRandomkid321> ^^
<bicyclerepairman> so?
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, we can choose to eat just vegetables. That's called being a vegetarian, not an herbivore.
<Gold_Demona> Being an herbivore means you physically cannot digest meat
<DoctoDoctorWho> bicyclerepairman: because it is scientificly proven to be an unhealthier lifestyle than just eating plants
<MadSurge> Yep, we're still omnivores
<Ryunosuke> your body still retains the dna and structure to eat and digest meat
<Gold_Demona> Yeah
<TheRandomkid321> The last Vegitarian I saw was stupid and din't believe in evolution and belived the wprld was less than 10,000 years old.
<Spell-of-Gaming> But it's still possible to eat meat.
<bicyclerepairman> DoctoDoctorWho: what is?
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: there's still peopl that believe the bible theory? :D
<Gold_Demona> We are not herbivores or carnivores based on what we CHOOSE to eat. We are omnivores based on the fact that we CAN eat both meat and vegetables.
<Ryunosuke> and it has been proven that your body obtains minerals from meat more efficiently than from plants
<TheRandomkid321> MadSurge Unfortunatle
<bicyclerepairman> supplements, Ryunosuke
<DoctoDoctorWho> bicyclerepairman: besides, what makes eating plants better than eating animals? they are both lifeforms.
<Phase4> its not IMPOSIBLE to live healthy without eating meat, but you better like eggs
<Ryunosuke> bicyclerepairman, so you would eat a car?
<AdamTheDuck> Suddenly Phase4 :4
<Ryunosuke> let me ask this
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<bicyclerepairman> DoctoDoctorWho: plants aren't fluffy and cute and can't look at you with big brown eyes
<Jmo> ._.
<bicyclerepairman> I would if I could, Ryunosuke
<Ryunosuke> do you drink milk? do you eat eggs? do you eat ANY bakery products what so ever? :0
<TheRandomkid321> So... WHO ELSE IS GETTING THE NEW XCOM GAME!?
<Jmo> Who brought up this topic?
<Phase4> if you dont like eggs then your stuffed
<bicyclerepairman> uhm, Ryunosuke... I said I ate meat
<Spell-of-Gaming> Some vegetarians don't like eggs AND milk. .-.
<DoctoDoctorWho> bicyclerepairman: neither can a mute blind man, does that make him okay to eat?
<Ryunosuke> oh
<bicyclerepairman> he might be cute, DoctoDoctorWho
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dairy products, in general.
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: I would, if my laptop was any good with more modern games :D
<Ryunosuke> dairy products in general constitute meat products by relation
<TheRandomkid321> MadSurge Isn't it for Xbox 360?
<DoctoDoctorWho> bicyclerepairman: I think trees are cute, I still eat off them
<TheRandomkid321> Too
<Gold_Demona> Spell-of-Gaming: Them's vegans. Not vegetarians.
<bicyclerepairman> you monster :O
<bicyclerepairman> :3
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: you mean the shitty FPS or the strategy RPG?
<Gold_Demona> Vegans go completely all out and don't even eat animal byproducts
<TheRandomkid321> I don't eat eggs I'm not into chicken periods
<DoctoDoctorWho> the bacon tree, BEST. EVER.
<TheRandomkid321> MadSurge Startegy RPG
<Gold_Demona> Mmmmmm bacon
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: it's also for PC
<Gold_Demona> I don't think I could live if I couldn't eat bacon... And steak... and chicken... and cheeseburgers...
<TheRandomkid321> MadSurge But it's also for xbpox right?
<Spell-of-Gaming> If you think eggs are chicken periods, that's just the stupidest thing I have ever heard.
<Tiberium126> G'day all.
<Gold_Demona> And baby back ribs...
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hi Tiberium126
<TheRandomkid321> I was joking
<Moopy> Night everypony got to hit the hey see you guys in the morning aight..............peace.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Do periods have babies?
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Moopy
<Tiberium126> No moopy :(
<Ryunosuke> I like some good chicken wings
<Gold_Demona> Spell-of-Gaming: Well, technically they are.
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: I 'unno, I hate Xbox :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> Tiberium126: Guess what?!?!
<Moopy> sorry dude i have to go
<TheRandomkid321> Spell-of-Gaming Not all eggs have fetuses
<Tiberium126> DoctoDoctorWho, I love guessing games
<Gold_Demona> Spell-of-Gaming: The chicken eggs we eat don't have baby chickens in them. Not even embryos.
<Moopy> later
<Phase4> 0,2Meat is considered a required part of diet due to the need for protenes and iron which are incredibly dificult (if not imposible) to get from plants
<DoctoDoctorWho> Tiberium126: Im getting C&C 3 soon!
<Jmo> Oh god the colours.
<Jmo> They burn.
<Tiberium126> DoctoDoctorWho: :D
<Phase4> and now you know
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: just the nutrient necessary for the embryo
<bicyclerepairman> well, a period isn't an embryo as well
<Ryunosuke> ohai Phase4
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Exactly
<Ryunosuke> :)
<AdamTheDuck> Colours! What is this madness Phase4? :<
<Ryunosuke> okay let me ask this
<bicyclerepairman> but the... uh... cell... thingie is inside every egg
<Phase4> did manually so i would be noticed
<DoctoDoctorWho> Colors for mods are like canterlocks for luna
<TheRandomkid321> COLOURS! EVERYBODYN RURURURURURUN
<Gold_Demona> Spell_of_Gaming: In order for the egg to have a baby inside, the egg would have to first be fertilized.
<MadSurge> Phase4, I missed your blue text :3
<Gold_Demona> Spell_of_Gaming: Generally, chickens that are farmed for eggs never see any roosters.
<Jmo> This topic..;_;
<bicyclerepairman> Phase4: you can get those proteins from animal byproducts
<bicyclerepairman> but it
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: except for when farmers need them to breed :D
<bicyclerepairman> 's a problem for vegans*
<Gold_Demona> Spell_of_Gaming: No rooster means no fertilized egg. Ergo, no baby.
<Ryunosuke> is peta against wolves, lions, tigers, coyote, or bobcats, Eagles or Hawks, as thier entire diet constitutes eating other animals? :)
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Then they are farmed for breeding, not egg farming. :P
<MadSurge> Ryunosuke: Ikr
<TheRandomkid321> Gold_Demona SHE HAS THE RIGHT IDEA!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: chicken eggs are yummy
<Gold_Demona> I love chicken eggs. :3
<Phase4> bicyclerepairman, exactly
<Gold_Demona> I eat ALL THE CHICKEN PERIODS!
<TheRandomkid321> I'm gonna try the next vomit inducing challenge. eat a whole 6 pack of raw chicken eggs
<bicyclerepairman> you said meat though, not animal products ;-)
<Ryunosuke> hello salmonela :)
<Gold_Demona> Um, TheRandomkid321. You could DIE doing that.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: well, they don't involve any blood, so it's not very gross :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Eeyup :3
<Phase4> bicyclerepairman, its hard to get iorn from anything thats not red meat
<TheRandomkid321> Gold_Demona But rocky...
<bicyclerepairman> it's not that difficult, I looked that up for my gf once
<AdamTheDuck> Why don't you stream for us Phase4? Pwease? :3
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: Who?
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, streams free?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: it's like dem idiots trying to eat spoonful of cinnamon
<Ryunosuke> without suplements/vitamins?
<Phase4> indeed it is
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: Dude, raw chicken has salmonella in it. That stuff can KILL you.
<Spell-of-Gaming> ^
<TheRandomkid321> No Rw CHocken Eggs
<Jmo> Genius.
<Ryunosuke> that is why we figured out how to use fire :)
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: Raw eggs have it too
*Jmo slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> And fish
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's sad to say, some athletes eat raw chicken eggs.
<TheRandomkid321> Oh...
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ew.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: that's why Gordon Ramsey REALLY cares about chicken not being raw.
<bicyclerepairman> for example, beans, oats, spinach, walnuts etc
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Exactly
<Gold_Demona> I don't blame Ramsey for going rage mode over raw chicken.
<Jmo> Ah Ramsey.
<Jmo> So entertaining.
<Gold_Demona> I don't even WATCH any of the shows he's in. I only know him by reputation. :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: at least he gets angry only at idiots in the kitchen :D
<Jmo> Tsk tsk
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Exactly. He's not just being an asshole.
<Ryunosuke> bicyclerepairman, the problem then is that too much of those items results in excessive diarhea, which is bad too
<bicyclerepairman> heh, true
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I wouldn't wanna work in his kitchen tho. :P
<Phase4> i think that worked
<Gold_Demona> O hey, a stream! :D
<AdamTheDuck> Stream is up Phase4 :P
<XylemTube> that stream scared the shit outta me
<Vordox> Inb4 ded people due to music
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also, he's a great cook first and a great showman later
<Jmo> eww Adam is playing
<Phase4> XylemTube, Success!
<Jmo> u suk Adam
*AdamTheDuck licks Jmo :P
<MadSurge> I hear Chrysalis :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: That's why I have a lot of respect for him. He really cares about what he serves on his plates.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh my god
<Spell-of-Gaming> Someone actually made a movie about the heads and tails of a coin
<Spell-of-Gaming> wa
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> Well, I'd find that an interesting topic.
<Jmo> Rofl.
<Gold_Demona> Is it like an actual MOVIE movie where the two sides are characters, or is it a documentary explaining why they're there?
<MadSurge> The hell :D
<MadSurge> Time for DJ Pon3!
<Gold_Demona> DJ Pwnage?

<Phase4> fluttershy has arrows through her face and does not care
<MadSurge> Phase4: she's that badass
<DoctoDoctorWho> flutterspy?
<Gold_Demona> Arrow through knee. Give up adventure. Fluttershy gets arrow through face. Gives no fucks.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: so Skyrim is full of pussies
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Exactly.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: Of course, knee's are vital organs, face's arent
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Oh yeah. I forgot. 6_9
<Gold_Demona> The knee is only one of the most unstable joints in the human body. :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: Im planning on getting my entire skeleton replaced with titanium
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: did you know that Rivale rhymes with Caviale? :D
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Not adomantium?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: sadly, I need real metals
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I have no idea what either of those things are, but that's cool. XD
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Aww. :(
<Jmo> glhf with magnets
<DoctoDoctorWho> maybe Ill get Carbon nanotube infusions...
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: rival and caviar :D Italian version of grudge and fudge
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Ooooooh

<DeadpoolDash> looks like mane6 has posted a bunch of vids of their tourney they had
<AdamTheDuck> hl2.exe has stopped working >.>
<AdamTheDuck> Damn you Valve.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: of course, Pinkie could just be making this up and never eaten fish eggs :D
<DeadpoolDash> hl2.exe is known for that
<Jmo> aww poor diddums Adam
<DeadpoolDash> it always crashes when is thinks hl3.exe is coming
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: lol Yeah

<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yup

<Jmo> Oh god 404.
<Jmo> y Phase
<Cypresswolf> Huzzah! TF2 Action ^_^
<MadSurge> Phase4 is RD :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> No love 4 trixie?:(
<Cypresswolf> Morning Everyone :)
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Cypresswolf
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Cypresswolf
<Jmo> I feel sorry for all those lpayers.
<Jmo> lpayers*
<AdamTheDuck> lol
<Jmo> players. how to engrish
<Gold_Demona> lol
<DoctoDoctorWho> No trixie love?:(
<Gold_Demona> You gonna slap people around with rtouts now Jmo?
<Jmo> Na
<Jmo> I'mg ood
<Jmo> good*
<Gold_Demona> :D
<Jmo> Smart medic.
<DoctoDoctorWho> *twitch twitch* Grammar Nazi self destruct sequence in 5 seconds...
<XAX> That was awesome.
<XAX> Doom 3 in 1:09:00.
<DoctoDoctorWho> 4 seconds...
<AdamTheDuck> Heil grammar!
<Jmo> Oh Phase4, you're getting toyed with badly.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Proper grammar detected, self destruct averted.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Y nopony leik Trixie?
<MadSurge> :D
<Phase4> Rainbow wins
<XAX> seth pls go
<Gold_Demona> Cuz Trixie's a beeatch? :P
<Jmo> So close.
<MadSurge> YAY FOR YOU Phase4!
*DoctoDoctorWho flips between Grammar Nazi and internet speak frequently
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: Ever consider that showing off and being dramatic was her special talent?
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: That's not helping her case any. :P
<Gold_Demona> dem Pacman noises
<Jmo> Pacman o.o
<DeadpoolDash> damn tf2 being all "Not Responding"
<DoctoDoctorWho> She may have gone a LITTLE overboard with taunting the crowd, but she is just being herself!
<Jmo> Rofl
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Still not helping her case any. :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> A loveable showpony with a talent for illusion magic
<Gold_Demona> showpony yes. Lovable no
<MadSurge> Basically, it's RD's boasting gone all wrong
<Gold_Demona> She oozes arrogance.
<MadSurge> ^
*Jmo pats Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> :)
<MadSurge> That doesn't mean she can't get better, but in Boast Busters she's insufferable
<Gold_Demona> Yeah
<DoctoDoctorWho> so should we all hate RD forever because she likes to strut her stuff and sometimes gets a bit carried away?
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWHo: RD has redeeming qualities. Trixie didn't show any
<Gold_Demona> None
<DeadpoolDash> pretty sure tf2 is going to crash on me
<Jmo> Crash all TF2s
<DoctoDoctorWho> You guys arent considering that she has more to herself than what she showed on stage, no second chances? no love? no tolerance?
<DoctoDoctorWho> I know there is a good pony behind all those fireworks and ego boosts, I can see it.
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: If she proves herself as anything other than the arrogant bitch she was through the entire episode, then sure. But as of yet, she has not shown ANY qualities that suggest there are any good intentions in her.
<DeadpoolDash> trixie and gilda are some of the best antogonists in the series
<Ryunosuke> I dont have anything agaisnt trixie per se
<MadSurge> She didn't seem that nicer when she was in her wagon, DoctoDoctorWho :|
<Gold_Demona> Gilda I hate with a burning passion
<Ryunosuke> she is a showmare, her JOB is to exagerate
<DeadpoolDash> which makes Gilda a great antogonist
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: one of s3 episodes will be about them trying to be better :D *speculation*
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: If she showed ANY good qualities at all in the episode, I must've missed them. I don't just mean on stage. I mean at all ever the entire time she was on screen.
<DeadpoolDash> no spoilers
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I know Trixie's supposed to make a comeback, but I saw nothing about Gilda.
<MadSurge> I said *speculation*, DeadpoolDash :D
*Jmo4267 slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo4267> Damn clone
<DoctoDoctorWho> She obviously puts her show face on when her "fans" are around, otherwise she loses stage credibility.
<DeadpoolDash> speculate is very close to spoiler if there were any leaked scripts/overviews
<DoctoDoctorWho> If we saw her on vacation or on the road, she would almost definitly be different
<Gold_Demona> If Trixie's character is improved in her next appearance, then that's cool. But from everything I saw in the one episode she appeared in. She's just an arrogant bitch.
<Jmo> osnap.
<MadSurge> DeadpoolDash: that's it then, no evidence found of that yet
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: she's certainly fairly powerful, but Twilight is this much above her
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: It seems to me your judgement on Trixie is based on the tragedy the fanon has built around her.
<AdamTheDuck> This argument is getting a little overboard...
<Gold_Demona> I'm just going by what I saw in the episode.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: silly fandom, Trixie is for kids :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> MadSurge: k, that was good. Ill give you that.:D
<MadSurge> Ok, gotta cook some pasta, be back later :P
<Gold_Demona> kk
<DoctoDoctorWho> But Im just trying to be more open to speculation instead of writing her off like pinkie initialy did with gilda, while gilda truly DID prove to be a bitch, we have no further evidence that trixie is any worse than we saw.
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: We also have no proof that she's any better either. =/
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: thats what I mean!
<Jmo> I AM BEST PONAY.
<Jmo> Arguement settled.
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo is best pony. Ineed.
<DoctoDoctorWho> wd
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Bottom line. I'm not gonna like her unless I see some ACTUAL redeeming qualities,
<Gold_Demona> Not speculation
<AdamTheDuck> indeed*
<Dovah> Wuts goin on?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Judgemental jelousy pants...
<Jmo> wait wut
<Jmo> Dovah and DoctoDoctorWho are two people?
<Jmo> WTf
<Gold_Demona> With fictional characters. If a character never actaully shows redeeming qualities, then they don't have any.
<Dovah> Jmo: yeah
<Jmo> Then
<Jmo> Oh my god wut.
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, that's why I asked why you were talking to dovah :$
<Jmo> Cause I saw Dovah as DoctoDoctorWho before.
<Dovah> Jmo: DoctoDoctorWho was just at my house this weekend
<Jmo> Righto.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Well I have to leave bye everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Bye DoctoDoctorWho
<Gold_Demona> kk
<Gold_Demona> laters
<Dovah> see you at school DoctoDoctorWho
<Jmo> I've been lied to.
<Jmo> ;_;
<Jmo> You lai Adam.
<Gold_Demona> Poor Jaymoo D:
*AdamTheDuck makes Jmo some tea :<
*Gold_Demona gives Jmo a muffin
<Jmo> tea sounds good right now.
<Jmo> Buut we're out of milk. fml
*AdamTheDuck licks Jmo :<
<AdamTheDuck> So much ded in chat :/
<Jmo> I blame you.
<Phase4> one more map then i need to do stuff
<Gold_Demona> That's because most of the chat was the Trixie debate, and that died when the opposing party left the chat. :P
<Gold_Demona> I was having fun, too.
<Gold_Demona> That was a good debate
<Gold_Demona> I still don't agree with him, but he made some valid points.
<AdamTheDuck> Dat cough laugh
*Jmo pats Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> lol, I bought Pok?mon Black 2 and White 2 on Amazon yesterday, and I just got the shipping confirmation today. Current location: US
<Gold_Demona> WOW, Amazon! That's REALLY specific!
<Gold_Demona> Nice to know EXACTLY where my package is, lol! :D
<AdamTheDuck> That's the reliable Amazon we know and love. :D
<Jmo> Huzzah for specific tracking.
*Jmo slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> Oi you're Australian
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<AdamTheDuck> But I buy books sometimes from Amazon... :<
<Jmo> What books?
<Gold_Demona> I buy lots of things from Amazon.
<Jmo> You better not be buying 50 Shades of Grey.
<AdamTheDuck> Lol no XD
<Gold_Demona> Mostly because I can spend the reward points on my credit card on there.
<AdamTheDuck> Goliath by Scott Westerfeld
<XAX> AHAHAHA that book was on the table one day at lunch time when I went home from school for lunch, so i took it back and read it in English
<XAX> >my teachers face when
<AdamTheDuck> I might the whole Leviathan series :P
<Jmo> What a cool kid.
<Gold_Demona> No, Jmo. He's buying Twilight
<Jmo> FFFFF

<Jmo> ew invisible boss.
<Phase4> Lil_B, the nes game?
<Lil_B> Phase4 the SNES game
<Phase4> cause if so that toom em a while
<Phase4> close enough
<Phase4> i could rip one of those easy
<Lil_B> Phase4 yeah, I guerss most people where just pleased with the regular mp3s :/
<Cypresswolf> Vinyl Scratch rocks to hard because she's not a mortal pony - :) I have Tenacious D stuck in my head
<Phase4> Oh, the music
<Phase4> thats a smidge harder but not that hard
<Phase4> Lil_B, the original stuff is 'chiptunes', as in it is litteraly instructions for a chip
<RoboGerbil> zomg octavia keeled you
<Jmo> Lul
<Lil_B> Phase4 the SNES already used samples
<Phase4> Lil_B, interspliced with the sound chip
<Phase4> it could not have stored full music
<Phase4> 16bit memory buss, it couldnt address a small mp3
<Phase4> let alone play one
<Lil_B> Phase4 it used Trackers, or Midis
<Gold_Demona> I thought they didn't do that until the age of Playstation
<Lil_B> Phase4 it didn't had the Mp3, it just stored the order in which they were played+ additional modulations
<Lil_B> the samples were playxed*
<DeadpoolDash> lolz at the Spike VA playing Fighting is Magic
<Gold_Demona> dem midis
<Gold_Demona> I used to collect midis
<Phase4> shhhh
<Phase4> i chose rainbow dash as next boss
<Phase4> :3
<Gold_Demona> lol XD
<Phase4> Lil_B, point is it wasn't stored as pcm
<Phase4> you cant play back an actuall lossless copy with any normal player
<Phase4> unless your using vlc but its better than normal

<Lil_B> I'm thinking about switching to eather Foobar or just using VLC for my music too though
<DeadpoolDash> well tf2 is being dumb right now so that enough for me
<Lil_B> WMP isn't bad once you got all the Codecs, has some neat features to get your music ordered, but it has still too many faults imo compared to others
<Jmo> Oh bollocks.
<Jmo> You and your RD Phase.

<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I got a few Pony munchkin-like cards :3
<RoboGerbil> lol that plush isnt very cooperative

<Spectrum_Rush> ok fine Wrek I have 3 Rainbow dash plushes, Princess Luna, Nightmare night Derpy, and one of my oc

<Spectrum_Rush> I saved... and they weren't that expensive >_><_<
<Ponies47> ^
<Mega_Milk> Wrek: Like a baws. Like a baws.
<FakeSaturn> 08,01how was Canterlot Gardens?
<FakeSaturn> 08,01i heard some bad rumours about it
<Cypresswolf> Plushies are too expensive for me - customs and actual toys, not so much
<Ponies47> FakeSaturn: It was the worst time of my life. >_><_<
<Gold_Demona> Maybe I could get a custom made of my OC instead. :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: at BUCK they were selling the character cards for this upcoming Munchkin-like game with ponies :3
<Cypresswolf> would like a Gilda plush, if I had the $ to buy one :)
<RoboGerbil> Gold_Demona: why dont you just make your own oc as a plushie? it cant be that hard...
<FakeSaturn> 08,01Ponies47: seriously?
<FakeSaturn> 08,01MadSurge: holy shit!
<FakeSaturn> 08,01how did i miss that?!
<Ponies47> FakeSaturn: NAH! It was awesome. Best time of my life!
<FakeSaturn> 08,01i fucking love Munchkin!
<Ponies47> Dat Tomska
<Spectrum_Rush> Gold_Demona: try etsy my oc one was only $55
<MadSurge> Spectrum_Rush: Oh wow, that's almost a reasonable price :$
<Gold_Demona> Spectrum_Rush: Aaaaaand that's why I don't have one yet. T^T
<Mega_Milk> -lol
<Gold_Demona> I can't justify spending 55 bucks on a toy...
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Gold_Demona> Not with mortgage and car payments to make
<FakeSaturn> 08,01$55?!
<FakeSaturn> 08,01that's fucking cheap
<Mega_Milk> ^
<FakeSaturn> 08,01that's like... £35
<Spectrum_Rush> well then I shouldn't mention how much the others costed
<FakeSaturn> 08,01Spectrum_Rush: linky to plushie maker?
*Spectrum_Rush is somewhat insane
<FakeSaturn> 08,01Spectrum_Rush: also, linky to the plushie you got?
<Gold_Demona> It's a good price for a custom, but I can't justify it. T^T
<Jmo> O.O
<Ponies47> Spectrum_Rush: Same for me. Link to both pwease? :3
<Spectrum_Rush> FakeSaturn: give me a min or 2 I keep forgeting to save the links
<Kandarihu> Wow. We're really getting into the TomSka lately
<Gold_Demona> Dumb cops are dumb. XP
<MadSurge> FakeSaturn: next year let's have a few matches, I'd like to learn to play some Munchkin :D
<FakeSaturn> 08,01MadSurge: by next year, i might be into MTG
<FakeSaturn> 08,01we should play that
<Ponies47> :D
<MadSurge> FakeSaturn: No idea what that is :D
<Kandarihu> As silly as this is, I think it makes more sense than ASDF
<FakeSaturn> 08,01MadSurge: Magic: The Gathering
<MadSurge> Ah
<Jmo> Pokemans is betr
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Gold_Demona> ^^

<Ryunosuke> MTG is easy to learn, hard to master
<FakeSaturn> 08,01Jmo: gtfo
<Jmo> Naww
<FakeSaturn> 08,01:P
<Jmo> I collect all of them.
<Ryunosuke> there are only 2 basic rules to MTG, Rule on the cards, and LIFO
<Mega_Milk> Oh those awkward moments
<MadSurge> But there's only a handful of Pokemon that are not fluffy cute animals :( I want monstruous monsters
<Ponies47> Guns, guns everywhere
*FakeSaturn 08,01lies on MadSurge
<FakeSaturn> 08,01i'm a monstrous monster
<Lil_B> what are we watching?
<Ryunosuke> that being said, the hardest part of mastering MTG is deck building.... like childrens card games on motercycles :)
<AdamTheDuck> ^ XD
<MadSurge> FakeSaturn: YAY *is lied on
<Gold_Demona> Card games on motorcycles!!!!
*Ryunosuke misses his thallid deck and his ice age elf deck :)
