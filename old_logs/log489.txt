<Ponies47> Polydunami: The Chicago cubs?
<Polydunami> Yeah. They're doing pretty badly right now
<Ponies47> Polydunami: They kicked the Brewers butts last night. Which makes me sad because I'm from Wisconsin. :(
<mario_pony> Okay to make it clear to everypony it's Football NOT soccer
<Polydunami> In some places, there is no difference
<Ponies47> Polydunami: yeah.
*mario_pony flips tables
<CrimsonPhoenix> "The world needs more Bronies"-John de Lancie
<Spectrum_Rush> football, american football problem solved
<CrimsonPhoenix> The best quote ever
<Polydunami> Ponies47, Cubs got beat right back today by the same Brewers
<WallDives> REAL football, problem solved.
<WallDives> Feijenoord. enough said.
*Magical_pablez94 "uuuuuuuuuuuu" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyAtc-MyvA8&feature=related
<VioletGreySha> NO football even better solved
<Ponies47> Polydunami: true. But lets not get into a baseball war here.
<mario_pony> did somepony say WAR
<WallDives> VioletGreySha: aww, but I like football...
<Spectrum_Rush> futbol
<Polydunami> I like sports in general
<VioletGreySha> awww but i hate football =3
<Ponies47> O hey VioletGreySha :)
<VioletGreySha> hay Ponies47
<Spectrum_Rush> WallDives: language?
<Ponies47> mario_pony: No :$
<WallDives> Spectrum_Rush: my team, or where I'm from?
<Polydunami> Anyway, just stating a fact, Ponies47. I live nowhere near the midwest
<WallDives> I like sports enough for it to be my major...
<Ponies47> Polydunami: I do. Wisconsin brony right here :)
<Spectrum_Rush> WallDives: Feienoord?
<WallDives> Nederland.
<Polydunami> I know that much
<VioletGreySha> Germany here =3
<imgur> It's 4:30 am in the east.
<Ponies47> And before anypony asks NO we do not all grow dairy products here. :|
<WallDives> I'm in America, I was born in the The Netherlands.
<Ponies47> WallDives: Intresting
<Polydunami> At least you have three teams to cheer for, Ponies47
<Ponies47> Polydunami: true.
<Polydunami> We only have Hockey
<WallDives> and Canadian football.
<Spectrum_Rush> WallDives: danke
<Polydunami> Well, we used to have basketball, but the Grizzlies moved to Memphis
<imgur> Did you see the new hotdiggedydemon video?
<Ponies47> eeeyup
<Pwah> which one?
<StupidSexyCJ> imgur: a new Jappleack?
<Shamroc> night everypony im done for the night
<Pwah> the sonic one?
<WallDives> night Shamroc.
<StupidSexyCJ> night Shamroc
<Polydunami> Goodnight Shamroc :)
<Ponies47> Night Shamroc :)
<Ponies47> You want this cake?
<Polydunami> And I COULD cheer for the Canucks, but their season is over
<WallDives> dont remind me...
*WallDives sighs
<imgur> Just watch it.
<Spectrum_Rush> imgur: why ot link it then
<WallDives> and then the chat died.
<Polydunami> Well, it's not like the Canucks are gone forever
<Polydunami> So don't feel too bad
<WallDives> just feels like forever.
<WallDives> ah well. Theres EURO for this month.
<WallDives> so...uh...yeah. Dat Fighting is magic.
<Ponies47> When does that game come out?
<Polydunami> I dunno what to say :S
<WallDives> dont know, but probably later than October.
<Ponies47> I want it. It looks like fun.
<imgur> I'll give it to you straightforward. It's an announcement that the HDD store is avalible in europe, there's a discount offer this weekend, and that he may come to your hometown.
<Ponies47> Plus there's a code to get 15% off any T-shirts you buy
<Spectrum_Rush> fight is magic deserves money if ya ask me
<Ponies47> ^
<WallDives> maybe, but if they dont want it, we cant give it to them.
<WallDives> so, keep spending money on merch, which will make sure that MLP stays on air.
<Spectrum_Rush> yeah i guess but still
<WallDives> besides, if we paid for it, Hasbro would nuke them into the ground for copyright infringement.
<WallDives> and that would be bad.
<Ponies47> I hope MLP will last atleast 5-6 seasons or more.
<WallDives> tbh? I dont.
<Polydunami> I hope MLP will REMAIN GOOD for at least that long
<StupidSexyCJ> My fear is that it will eventually start spiraling downward in quality as the years go by
<Ponies47> Polydunami: yeah
<StupidSexyCJ> like spongebob or family guy
<Ponies47> Yeah like SPONGEBOB!
<WallDives> I hope it has 5-6 seasons TOTAL. I dont want the series to burn out, run out of aesops, or turn into something I dont want to see.
<Ponies47> :|
<WallDives> the series is too precious, to pure for it to deserve that fate.
<pony_2369> I hope it lasts long, but still remain good. Look what happened to Spongebob :S Back then it was good, but now it's crap
<StupidSexyCJ> that being said, if they can maintain quality somehow, then please let it happen for a long time
<imgur> Ponies47: I just said the same thing ya crazy cunt! huhuhuhuh
<Ponies47> WallDives: yeah. I gotta argee. I would love to see a movie but as A SERIES FINALLY not while it's still on the air because after a TV show gets a movie and still runs it's never the same again
<StupidSexyCJ> i consider the movie to spongebob the ending to spongebob, period
<Ponies47> imgur: (Squee) YOU I CAN EAT ALL THESE APPLES *Noms on apples*
<StupidSexyCJ> but it was a GREAT ending
<WallDives> technically, the Movie IS the end.
<pony_2369> The movie still feels... distrubing :S
<Polydunami> Reminds me of The Simpsons
<ACS13123|Minecraft> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaG-JijAr-c&list=UUfBfjK2Gg777FLAWrAZ6Slg&index=1&feature=plcp
<Ponies47> StupidSexyCJ: Yeah after the movie. The show has never benn the same :(
<WallDives> all the episodes, happen before the movie, iirc.
<StupidSexyCJ> i think they burned themselves out on the movie or something
<Polydunami> That movie happened a while ago, actually
<Polydunami> Wow
<imgur> What about Phineas and Ferb? There was a movie, and the show keeps going.
<Ponies47> New Spongegbob sucks. Period :|
<WallDives> opinion...
<WallDives> not saying I like it, I dont watch it.
<Polydunami> I don't really watch that show either
<WallDives> but if its really that bad? it wont be on the air. raitings and adverts and all that.
<Polydunami> Spongebob neither
<pony_2369> You know what's stupid? People were sueing Spongebob back then because it was "unappropriate". I don't hear much about that little disbute now for some reason
<WallDives> same no one hears about the Pokemon/Evolution arguements.
<Polydunami> People get bored of making a big deal out of nothing
<Polydunami> Usually
<imgur> Did you miss last saturday's ponies and got Batman instead?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm going to sleep, Goodnight everyone
<StupidSexyCJ> Ponies47: too many other shows for kids that can get worse to worry about now
<Polydunami> Goodnight TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
<StupidSexyCJ> night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<WallDives> night TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
<imgur> Because you ignored the warnings.
<XAX> hai guize wats goin on in ths chat?
<ninja_pony> ya um does anyone know if there is a demo i can play of my little pony friendship is fighting??
<WallDives> ninja_pony, you mean fighting is magic?
<pony_2369> I don't think so
<ninja_pony> yes
<ninja_pony> my bad :)
<WallDives> not until Canterlot Gardens, thats the first open beta.
<Ponies47> Night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<WallDives> and you have to go there. otherwise, you wait until it releases.
<Ponies47> StupidSexyCJ: eeyup
<WallDives> they MIGHT have a playable build at EVO, but it hasent been announced.
<StupidSexyCJ> well at least they have a beta ready, I was starting to think it was just never gonna happen
<ninja_pony> walldives?? where can i sign up for the beta?
<Polydunami> I hope Oklahoma City wins the finals. Long shot, but still
<WallDives> ninja_pony, there is no "beta". just a playable build. that you have to go there for, in person.
<pony_2369> Where's that located?
<Ponies47> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmGt0EhVToE&NR=1&feature=endscreen <- I want this idea turned into a episode. But with the mane 6. :)
<ninja_pony> oooh ok yeah so there is a build lke demo i can get my hands on right now?
<WallDives> Canterlot Gardens is near Cleveland, and is in the last weekend of September.
<ninja_pony> ok thx :)
<pony_2369> Ah I see
<WallDives> ninja_pony: no.
<WallDives> there is no playable build atm.
<ninja_pony> walldives :(
<ninja_pony> lol
<Ponies47> I'm in Wisconsin. I'm to young to drive. If I could I would drive to the Canterlot Gardens
<ninja_pony> yeah kk thx for the info i mean :)
<WallDives> hell, theres only 3 characters close to completion, 2 incomplete, and one not started.
<WallDives> np.

<StupidSexyCJ> I hope Trixie is playable character
<ninja_pony> walldives so i should be able to have a good in like september?
<ninja_pony> go
<Ponies47> And now it's time for some smooth jazz
<Ponies47> IT'S SO SMOOOOOOOOOOOOTH!
<ninja_pony> IT SO SMOOTH YOU CANT TAKE IT
<WallDives> you should be able to see it played? probably. you probably wont be able to play it until, if I had to guess, maybe November or December.
<WallDives> thats a guess mind. we know it wont be before October, if schedule holds.
<StupidSexyCJ> I hope the next Two Best Friends that gets ponified is Resident Evil 4

<Ninjazz> And waiting for some splicer come by...
*Magical_pablez94 random dance!
<StupidSexyCJ> Ghosties: naw best part is throwing corpses at splicers to make more corpses with

<Om> Ninjazz: The highest fall the furthest.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Already completely red ;)
<Ninjazz> Doesn't mean she will cry.
<Om> Ninjazz: There is no point in trying to justify it to yourself.
<Ninjazz> I hate when her fanon makes her such a insecure, just want to be loved mare.
<Ghosties> 04Um...you might wanna go to a hospital..
<Ninjazz> It's my headcanon. I can justify it for myself.
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's just blood, nothing serious
<Ghosties> 04How much?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Dunno, lots?
<Spectrum_Rush> http://derpy.me/KBcZW
<Ghosties> 04Lots, and you say it's just blood :I
<XAX> Ninjazz: I can't read the word "headcanon" without picturing someone with a cannon sticking of their mouth.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Like I said, I've had worse
<Ghosties> 04Doing what?
<Ninjazz> lol XAX
<Very_Silly_Filly> I did this before when I crushed my wrist in a car accident
<alexxm> well that makes my werid dream seem inconsequntionlal
<Very_Silly_Filly> Had to have I think it was 4 bones replaced.
<Ninjazz> I love how you're filling up this chat with wet manes, Spectrum_Rush. ^^
<Spectrum_Rush> XAX: Ninjazz http://fim.413chan.net/art/src/132177323722-HeadCannon.png
<alexxm> ouch
<Om> Ninjazz: Just saying, you don't lie unless you have something to hide.
<XAX> Spectrum_Rush: THANK YOU
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: well no one else is anymore
<Ghosties> 04Jesus...you don't have much luck do you, Filly?
<Very_Silly_Filly> No, not really :/
<Ninjazz> Om: You have a good point. But I don't care about her... I know that sounds like a jerk move... But first impressions and her continued support through her own fanon... annoys me.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I realised that after I managed to shoot a friend in the shoulder with an airsoft by accident
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush: You know I appreciate it. ^^
<Very_Silly_Filly> Confound those sensitive triggers
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: changing it up slightly http://derpy.me/kYNR2
<Om> Ninjazz: You dissliker her because she has support?
<Ghosties> 04Ninjazz, you mean like Sethisto supporting his obsession over her?
<alexxm> was he hurt badly Very_Silly_Filly
<BronyJenkins|RAGED> Hey everypony...
<Ninjazz> Not just that... Just how much she gets over ponies WHO should.
<alexxm> hey BronyJenkins|RAGED hows your day been
<Ghosties> 04Like?
<Very_Silly_Filly> No, other than having to have the pellet removed surgically
<TheRainbowDash> Hello BronyJenkins|RAGED, and hello everypony.:)
<Om> Ninjazz: Like Rarity.
<Ninjazz> And well... She's dislikeable pony.
<Magical_pab|Music> BronyJenkins|RAGED: t u raged?
<WallDives> hello BronyJenkins|RAGED, TheRainbowDash.
<Ghosties> 04Hmm, I suppose
<Ninjazz> Not just Rarity... Celestia as well.

<alexxm> hey TheRainbowDash hows your day been
<Ninjazz> Hey, Dashie.
<Ghosties> 04I'll give you Celestia, Trixie certainly seems to have much more support and love than Celestia does
<Ninjazz> Om: So?
<TheRainbowDash> Magical_pab|Music: Yesterday was absolutely flawless, and today maybe even be better than ysterday, so of course, I'm doing amazing.:)
<ChimerAsleep> Zzzz
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ghosties: I agree, Trixie has Meanwhile after all ;)
<BronyJenkins|RAGED> So pretty much a bad day. :P
<Spectrum_Rush> http://derpy.me/2hEmj swappin it up
<Ninjazz> You see? Celestia doens't do anything wrong and she gets hated. Trixie?... She's a gosh darn antagonist.
*Ninjazz sighs
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: I know, I hate Trixie with a dying passion.
<Ninjazz> YOU DO?!
<XAX> TheRainbowDash :>
<TheRainbowDash> Yes, I do.
*Ninjazz hugs TheRainbowDash
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sounds like chocolate toast
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Yay!:D
<Ninjazz> You do not know how happy I am to hear that! ^^
<Magical_pab|Music> TheRainbowDash: that really is a good news! i'm really happy to hear this :D!
<Om> We just cant accept all the ponies can we
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'mma go get some!
<Ghosties> 04Well, you have support in your hatred of Trixie since Val despises her too
<Ninjazz> Even Val?...
<TheRainbowDash> Magical_pab|Music: Yeah, got a bunch of awards and what not, I got the persidental award for excellence, or something like that.
<Ninjazz> Wow...

<Kandarihu> Whatever happened to Val? He hasn't been around lately.
<XAX> All dem ,
<Ninjazz> You got an award, TheRainbowDash?
<TheRainbowDash> XAX: I use commas a lot, but I speak fast.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Actually, several of them.
<Ninjazz> Huh. Nice. Which ones?
*XAX grants TheRainbowDash his congratulatory hugs.
*alexxm hugs TheRainbowDash well done
<Shimmer> Morning everypony
<Ninjazz> I sense an incoming text wall.
<Ninjazz> Hey Shimmer!
<alexxm> hey Shimmer hows your day been
<WallDives> morning, Shimmer.
<trollhunter> goodmorning shimmer
<StefOfAllPonies> I sense that after I post a meme relevant to Bronystate others will..
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: I got perfect attendance throughout the whole year, an award for the highest grade percentage average in a class (Science), the presidental award for excellence, completion of middle school, and I will be attending an IB program next year, so will be taking AP/IB classes in high school.
<Chimera> My face is tired
<Shimmer> alexxm: it just started :)
<StefOfAllPonies> Yup
<Ninjazz> Got it. :3
<Chimera> x.x
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Shimmer!
<Ghosties> 04Congrats TheRainbowDash
<Shimmer> Hiya TheRainbowDash
<Very_Silly_Filly> Back with chocolate toast
<Om> Sweet
<TheRainbowDash> Ghosties: D'awwww, thanks.
<TheRainbowDash> :)
<BronyJenkins|RAGED> Awesome. ^_^
<StefOfAllPonies> :D
<Ninjazz> Daayuum, nice! TheRainbowDash. :)
<WallDives> TheRainbowDash, congrats, you overachiever.
<alexxm> great to hear TheRainbowDash well done
<Shimmer> Very_Silly_Filly: Fuuu making me hungry
*Magical_pab|Music sings "Hey, I just met you,and this is crazy,but here’s my number,so call me, maybe?" this song is stucked in my head :D:D
<Ghosties> 04No prob
<Jim> That's awesome TheRainbowDash
<TheRainbowDash> WallDives: What? Overachiever?:D
<StefOfAllPonies> TheRainbowDash: Why you so good at things?
<TheRainbowDash> StefOfAllPonies: Because I actually try hard in school.
<Magical_pab|Music> sticked*
<StefOfAllPonies> TheRainbowDash: Well, as do I.
<Very_Silly_Filly> You mean Stuck?
<Very_Silly_Filly> :P
<Kandarihu> Ghosties: do you know what happened to ValtheJean? He seems to have disappeared lately.
<alexxm> Magical_pab|Music i think you mean stuck
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, he's around
<Ghosties> 04Not on right now, though
<TheRainbowDash> StefOfAllPonies: Oh, cool to hear. Did you get promoted to high school/graduate from high school yet?
<Ninjazz> Tha'ts cause he goes by Caramel.
<Ghosties> 04^That too
<Ninjazz> ^^
<Magical_pab|Music> alexxm: stuck sticked is almost the same.... isn't it?
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Eh, that pony is overrated/
<XAX> Hey I just number, and this is maybe; but here's my met you, so call me crazy.
<Kandarihu> I don't remember seeing Caramel lately either. I can't help but think he got in trouble the last time he trolled us.
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: I didn't even know he was popular... And DON'T say that around Val. :S
<TheRainbowDash> Kandarihu: In trouble? By who?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have nopony to stay with, and am proud. I honestly don't want a partner. I'd rather spend time with an animal than a person
<alexxm> Magical_pab|Music i guess so sticked just doesn't sound right
<StefOfAllPonies> TheRainbowDash: No, atleast I don't think so xD
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: I know, if I do, I'll get heavily in trouble.:D
<Kandarihu> Who else, the other mods.
*Magical_pab|Music sings "Hey, I just met you,and this is crazy,but here’s my number,so call me, maybe?" this song is STUCK in my head :D:D
<Om> Very_Silly_Filly: People tend to make things complicated anyway.
<Magical_pab|Music> alexxm: happy now? :D
<Ninjazz> Exactly, he nearly kicked someone just for saying "Caramel is worse pony".
<TheRainbowDash> Kandarihu: What did he do recently, and what was his punishment?
<XAX> Magical_pab|Music: Cool. You said it once
<Very_Silly_Filly> I learn from experience
<Shimmer> Very_Silly_Filly: Good cuz we're all ponies in here anyways :)
<alexxm> sorry Magical_pab|Music
*Spectrum_Rush since my browser is on the verge of a severe crash i here by end what i dub Wet Mane Hour thx for lookin at the pic ev'rypony :)
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's my parents fucking daily routine to argue
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Holy hay, really?
<Shimmer> It's quite normal Very_Silly_Filly :)
<Ninjazz> Awwwww, Spectrum_Rush. :<
<alexxm> thanks for the pics Spectrum_Rush
<Magical_pab|Music> alexxm: :D <--- dat face means laughing i'm not in anger :)
<XAX> Spectrum_Rush: 10pm my time is Wet Mane hour. I shall remember this.
<Kandarihu> Maybe you weren't around for it. He was streaming anime just like usual, when some people started complaining. So he ran the World's Greatest Tea Party again, in it's entirety...
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Eyup. Caught it and chewed him out for it. Just told him to keep your opinions to yourself.
<TheRainbowDash> Spectrum_Rush: I came in late, so I didn't even to view one single picture.:D
<TheRainbowDash> *get to
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: I even posted my smooth jazz. You missed a good thing. :3
<Spectrum_Rush> XAX: thats around 5am for me
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Wow, that is abuse of power then.
<Kandarihu> ...then he started trolling us with creepy pictures of G3.6 Scootaloo for a loooong time.
<alexxm> Kandarihu how many times did he stream it that week
<Magical_pab|Music> XAX: i know. dat alexxm keep correcting me so i corrected it. :D:D
<XAX> Spectrum_Rush: Lol
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Damn it...:D
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: That's just Val being Val. He warned it alteast.
<Ninjazz> him*
<Very_Silly_Filly> TheRainbowDash: I dunno, I've been kicked a few times by SB just for teh ololz
<XAX> I shall now go and sift through my To Read list, and see if there's anything I want to read.
<TheRainbowDash> Very_Silly_Filly: For the lulz is fine, but when Val makes a kick, it is usually serious.
<XAX> Ninjazz: READ IT NOW :<
<TheRainbowDash> SB is just a silly filly Very_Silly_Filly.:D
<Spectrum_Rush> TheRainbowDash: anypony wet mane you'd like to see i'll post one for you
<Very_Silly_Filly> But I thought SB was a stallion :/
<Ninjazz> XAX: Now?... :S
<spitfirecolt> good morning my everypony
<XAX> Ninjazz: If you want
<Kandarihu> Well, I get the sense that he went too far on that. It ran long enough that people who were coming in would come in on G3.6 Scootaloo trolling.
<TheRainbowDash> Spectrum_Rush: Rainbow Dash and Scratch are the only two I want to see.
<TheRainbowDash> Hello spitfirecolt!
<Shimmer> Morning spitfirecolt
<XAX> Spectrum_Rush: Spitfire in socks > everything
<alexxm> hey spitfirecolt hows your day been

<Ninjazz> You're graduating already?...
<Ninjazz> You just got out of Middle school!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hey, I'm leaving school next year
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Nah, it is for my brother now.
<Kandarihu> Frankly, if I were to ever have a chance to stream, I'd have something pony related to troll with that isn't as bad as G3.
<Ninjazz> Ah...
<Very_Silly_Filly> Doesn't seem 5 minutes since I was in year 7
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Silly filly..:D

<XAX> http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/303/016/36e.png
*XAX runs for his life
<Kandarihu> But I would have to build a MLP fanvid playlist for when people are good.
<TheRainbowDash> I sure will Ninjazz, but unforanutaely, he does not like ponies.:<
<Shimmer> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx9q-LUaSF0

<Ninjazz> Yes, Capn.
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Hey there Ninjazz.
<Shimmer> Yes Capn_Gavn
<Ninjazz> That is straight up r34/

<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: o_o, you go do that now.

<Very_Silly_Filly> I found a bullet on the table :/
<Ninjazz> But first a quick refresh. :$
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ooh, it's for the Luger
<Spectrum_Rush> TheRainbowDash: http://derpy.me/n71-n Rainbow Dash
<Shimmer> Very_Silly_Filly: You should make sure your parents ain't doing the arguing with guns
<alexxm> Very_Silly_Filly what game are you playing
<HiImSpike> hey everybrony
<Very_Silly_Filly> alexxm: This is real life
<Spectrum_Rush> TheRainbowDash: http://derpy.me/jH3vJ and vinyl
<TheRainbowDash> Spectrum_Rush: o////o....holy...hay.....
<Chimera> Owch
<TheRainbowDash> Hello HiImSpike!
<Ninjazz> Hello HiImSpike.
<alexxm> hey HiImSpike hows your day been
<HiImSpike> good thanks
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have a small collection of guns
<Shimmer> Hiya HiImSpike
<TheRainbowDash> Spectrum_Rush: Hnnng.....
<Very_Silly_Filly> And some of them happened to have ammo in them when I got them
<HiImSpike> anyone doing live
<Ninjazz> The deed is done.
<alexxm> ah right thanks Very_Silly_Filly how many do you have
<Very_Silly_Filly> 13
<Spectrum_Rush> TheRainbowDash: sorry it took so long my browser is derpin' real bad from The Wet Mane Hour
<Very_Silly_Filly> I did have another one somewhere, but I lost it
<TheRainbowDash> Spectrum_Rush: Doesn't matter to me, at least you got them both.:)
<Very_Silly_Filly> I even have a hat collection consisting of around 20
<XAX> Very_Silly_Filly: Any unusuals?
<HiImSpike> cool:)
<XAX> [/badjoke]
<Very_Silly_Filly> I do have a Luger from WWII
<Shimmer> Lady Gaga hats?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I got that from my great grandad
<WallDives> I only have 1 gun. and its all I need.
<Shimmer> Cool
<Very_Silly_Filly> I do have 1 gun which is for self defence if needed
<Shimmer> WallDives: You gonna need some more when the zombie apocalyps comes in december
<Very_Silly_Filly> Just a crappy glock though
<HiImSpike> true
<Shimmer> apocalypse*
<WallDives> Shimmer: if that happens, guns will be the least of problems.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I want a crossbow pistol
<Very_Silly_Filly> I would love to get one of them
<Elondras> :D
<Shimmer> I got plans laid out already
<HiImSpike> what would you do if their is apocylse
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yeah, my friends have got plans for the great apocolypse
<Om> If that happens, I plan to die. Plain and simple.
<Ninjazz> Having a gun during a zombie apoc isn't actually all that of a good thing. I would take an axe for more practical use.
<Very_Silly_Filly> If it happens, I'm going alone.
<trollhunter> wait why is the zombie apocalypse coming in december
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: its a shame that hour was so active most of the links have rolled out of the chat
<GlutenFreeJenkins> We can't have guns in England. D:
<Shimmer> If zombies happen, I'll drive to the local gunstore, stock up, then blow the 2 bridges connecting the island I live on to the mainland
<HiImSpike> chuck norris house
<WallDives> Shimmer: the problem is, so is everyone else.
<Very_Silly_Filly> GlutenFreeJenkins: You can, but you have to be licenced and all that stuff
<HiImSpike> :)
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush: Eh... It was us and only us alone that gets to enjoy them.
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Which sucks.
<Very_Silly_Filly> There is a weapon shop down my road in fact
<Shimmer> WallDives: According to hollywood, everyone will run around screaming like headless chickens
<GlutenFreeJenkins> I'll just get some Knifes and become badass instead.
<HiImSpike> Well im screwed anyway
<GlutenFreeJenkins> knives*
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm trying to create a gun
<Very_Silly_Filly> More powerful than any one I've ever come across
<WallDives> Shimmer, according to logic, everyone will attempt to raid the gun store, raid the supermarket and leave, ALL AT THE SAME TIME.
<alexxm> Shimmer you do know everyone else will be going to the gun store and if the guy who owns the store is still alive he might not like people trying to take his stock
<HiImSpike> Ive got a boat and wait till its over
<GlutenFreeJenkins> I'll probably run into a DIY shop, and stock up on axes.
<HiImSpike> haaaaa me to
<Very_Silly_Filly> GlutenFreeJenkins: Yeah, but if you have melee weapons, you have to be careful not to be bled on
<Very_Silly_Filly> Especially on the wounds
<WallDives> the gun store owner will lock up first, the supermarkets will probably just get raided, and everyone will get devouered in their cars, like cans of human tuna.
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Yeah, I wouldn't have much choice though.
*Magical_pab|Music i'm no more a blank flank :D http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/159/1/6/profile_picture_by_pablez94-d52pg5u.png
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Fishing?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I live in a pretty dangerous place. As illiegal as it is
<Shimmer> WallDives: The gun store is right around the corner for me, and I got a decently powered car, I'll take my chances on being first :p
<Very_Silly_Filly> I always have a knife with me, just in case
<HiImSpike> Actually I live in Australia so I would just go to the south pool and live with the pigeons
*Spectrum_Rush WMH never again or not for a week i think i've gone cross eyed6_9
<Shimmer> HiImSpike: lol pigeons
<Very_Silly_Filly> I guess it helps that my grandad has a land rover
<alexxm> Shimmer there is still the issue with the gun store owner not wanting people taking his stock
<Elondras> every swiss who was in the army have a assault rifle at home so that's no problem for mee^^
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm always ready
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Get a convoy live in RE: EXTINCTION. :3
<HiImSpike> thanks i forget
<GlutenFreeJenkins> like*

<Kandarihu> Spell-of-Gaming: I know what happened to Shigesato Itoi as a kid.
<Spectrum_Rush> Some aspects of the character designs remain very personal for Shigesato Itoi. In an interview on his website, Itoi describes how his inspiration for the final battle with Giygas resulted from a traumatic childhood event. When Itoi was a young boy, he accidentally viewed the wrong movie at a theater, a Shintōhō film entitled The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty. According to Itoi, the film featured a graphic rape
<TheRainbowDash> XAX: I know....I always have that urge to.
<TheRainbowDash> Geez bro, that wall.:D
*Spectrum_Rush cough
<Ninjazz> Dat graphic rape. O_O

<Ghosties> 04"It's gonna be great"
<Bronysith> Ghosties: yes it is true
<Ghosties> 04Yeah...if you don't pay attention to what's actually going on in the fandom
<Ninjazz> True.
<Ninjazz> Very true...
<Ninjazz> Politics.
<alexxm> whats happening Ghosties the only bronies i talk to are hear
<Ghosties> 04Not just politics
<Ninjazz> Not just?
<Ghosties> 04Corruption, greed, slander, envy, social climbers
<Ascendant> I do
<Ascendant> /dev/sda2 on /mnt/sda2 type ext3 (rw)
<WallDives> basically, any community?
<Ascendant> that's just <censored> up
<ScriptBot> Please do not swear. You have sworn 30 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
<Ghosties> 04Not really
<N4X> That sadly is the human nature Ghosties...
<Ninjazz> We can be called a community now?
<alexxm> i guess so Ninjazz
<Ghosties> 04The Brony fandom tends to have a looooooooooot more knee-jerk reactions to small and trivial things
<Ghosties> 04Most of the people in the fandom tend to lay all of their personal problems on the table with each other
<N4X> React to ALL the things!
<Ninjazz> True, Ghosties.
<Ghosties> 04So what happens then is that because everybody puts their problems out for everybody else to see, then nothing gets fixed
<Ninjazz> I know I have.
<Ghosties> 04Nothing gets better
<spitfirecolt> i am jumpinh on l4d2
<FlaschenJoe11> Hello Bronystate
<Ghosties> 04Plus, "love and tolerance" is a really, really bad mantra to have. Good in theory, but does not work in execution
<Bronysith> Ghosties: wow.
<alexxm> hey FlaschenJoe11 hows your day been
<Bronysith> Ghosties: i was just trying to welcome the new herd member
<Litwick> Ghosties: Especially considering how typical bronies react to cloppers.
<Ninjazz> But can't just talking about things make things better?
<Very_Silly_Filly> tl;dr :P Nah, jokes
<FlaschenJoe11> Pretty well, alexxm
<Ghosties> 04Oh?
<FlaschenJoe11> and yours?
<Ghosties> 04Eh, don't let me ruin this shit for you
<Litwick> Ghosties: I don't see any love and tolerance in that spectrum/
<alexxm> i'm good FlaschenJoe11
<Ghosties> 04It can be good, there are some good things if you look really close and really hard
<N4X> You can't love everybody and of course you can't tolerate everything Ghosties ,but I don't see why this wouldn't work MOST of the time
<Ninjazz> Love and tollerance is a anti-troll weapon to me, nothing more.
<Ghosties> 04^
<Ghosties> 04That's all it EVER was
<Ghosties> 04That's why it started
<Ghosties> 04It was meant to counter trolls
<Ghosties> 04But like I said, I don't wanna ruin the show for someone
<Ghosties> 04The show is great
<Ghosties> 04There's no reason not to watch
<XAX> People try to tell me Love and Tolerate is their life style
<Airpuff> Its great we have diffrent opinions
*Ninjazz pats Ghosties on the back
<XAX> They refuse to believe it was originally an anti-troll phrase
<Ghosties> 04I dunno man
<Ghosties> 04It's just...hard sometimes
<Ninjazz> I know...
<Ghosties> 04When you see things that you thought you wouldn't see happen in the fandom...it...kinda gets to you
<FlaschenJoe11> Isn't everything worthwile, Ghosties
<Ninjazz> All this is just so surreal. Good and bad, just weird sometimes too.
<Ninjazz> Sometimes?... Most of the time.
<Elondras> what does that mean Ghosties?
<WallDives> fandoms tend to be difficult to deal with.
<alexxm> Ghosties every fandom has a bad side
<N4X> Cosplays *shrugs*
<Ninjazz> I think it's the people who take the show to heart. Who litterally let it guide them.
<Ninjazz> I mean there are lessons.
<Ghosties> 04That is true, you are right alexxm
<Comet> Hey guys
<alexxm> hey Comet hows your day been

<Randomnerd> My academic focus has led me to read a lot of American Lit.
<Vordox> Lil_B: Heh :P
<HyperMetalLugia> yeah
<Aurora> 6during that time, you find out if they'll be a problem or not
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01LoGaN: Yes. I chase storms around.
<HyperMetalLugia> I have some bits of them growing in
<Aurora> 6or in my case, where they're completely sideways, you get them out immediately
<Aurora> 6lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Though I haven't done it in over a year.
<Randomnerd> Ironically, I've never read Cooper, the first important American novelist.
<LoGaN> nice are you on the show Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No.
<WallDives> I couldnt do it.
<AzulaSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: at least you can still move it. Nerves are not entirely damaged
<HyperMetalLugia> are they generally smaller than molars?
<CCCP> look at all these bath salts
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: Why the break?
<Litwick> Nittany_Dsicord: So you'rea tornado stalker?
<LoGaN> aww
<Octavarium> Is RAWRity around?
*CCCP nomz
<WallDives> too scared from the tornado I delt with.
<Octavarium> Whoops
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Can't afford to chase.
*Randomnerd ducksj
<CCCP> hi Octavarium
<red_ony> this song makes me sleepy
<red_ony> :/
<sagas> CCCP: Well I guess we better smoke them
<ScootaChicken> That's better.
<Very_Silly_Filly> AzulaSurge: My motor neurones are fine, but the ones which detect touch are pretty muched buggered
<CCCP> sagas: xD
<ScootaChicken> Anyway, is RAWRity around?
<CCCP> hello ScootaChicken :D
*Randomnerd is nommed
<Yahooz> not atm i think ScootaChicken
<ScootaChicken> I need to commend him.
<CCCP> nope ScootaChicken
<CCCP> hi yah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I was almost run over by a large tornado last year. My biggest regret that day was losing my phone.
<CCCP> Yahooz*
<Randomnerd> Nittany_Discord: Yikes.
<ScootaChicken> Yahooz: You've seen that certain pastebin document, right?
<ScootaChicken> It's amazing.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And the fact that the damn tornado was wrapped in rain.
<LoGaN> does anypony know when Therainbowdash will get on?
<Aurora> 6no
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nittany_Discord: You almost get injured, and you worry about your phone
<Yahooz> ScootaChicken: which one?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I lol'd
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: "No! Not my $200 iPhone!"
<ScootaChicken> Yahooz: THere's more than one?
<Gunthler> LoGaN: WHY? :[
<ScootaChicken> Oh gog
<ScootaChicken> I mean the one with FlareChaser
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't find it missing until after the incident.
<WallDives> Tornados are scary as hell.
<Aurora> 6they're about the same size
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I wanted to go see more tornadoes.
<Yahooz> ScootaChicken: >_< link me on skype
<red_ony> I'm glad we don't have those here
<LoGaN> Gunther what?
<AzulaSurge> Nittany_Discord: sounds pants shitting terrifying and awesome at the time. This side of the world seldomly has tornadoes
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Oh hey ScootaChicken, we found out that Kenne didnt have a clue what the song "I am the Walrus" is. Also that he doesnt listen to the Beetles.
<Randomnerd> "injured"? That's not how you spell "killed".
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Last year was tornado hell.
<ScootaChicken> RX-78-SweetieBot: ...where is he.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I don't know the circumstances of Tornado chasing
<ScootaChicken> HE WILL SUFFER
<ScootaChicken> THE FULL BRUNT OF MY WRAAAAAATH
<sagas> RX-78-SweetieBot: What! Impossible!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Wasn't sure whether to say, killed, hurt or injured
<Randomnerd> I'm a naturally nervous person :(
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ScootaChicken: right now on xbox, but I think skype as well
<HyperMetalLugia> well, I think mine are kinda small
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01200 in one day. Another one kills 100+ (I chased and caught my first tornado that day).

<ScootaChicken> RX-78-SweetieBot: Tell him that ScootaChicken thinks he's a twat.
<Aurora> 6they always start at the back
<sagas> Oh yay Billie Joel!
<Stallion_of_War> Nittany_Discord: Did you pit it in a jar with air holes and keep it for a few weeks?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I had a typhoon in my garden a few months ago
<HyperMetalLugia> seems to be enough spacing back there
<HyperMetalLugia> ohwell
<Stallion_of_War> *put
<DarkStar> hey guys.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Stallion_of_War: Nah. It escaped.

<WallDives> hi DarkStar.
<Very_Silly_Filly> It managed to destroy the plant pots and some other small things
<kirzstryfe> 8,6this is STYX

<Stallion_of_War> Apparently a tornado tore down a barn back like, 30 years ago or so, on our farm.
<LoGaN> idk
<Gunthler> Doofus
<HyperMetalLugia> hrm
<Nittany_Discord> 11,0150 people dying from a single tornado is almost unheard of now.
<WallDives> only delt with one tornado in 2000, and we left after that.
<HyperMetalLugia> seems a bit like mine
<Stallion_of_War> Nothing was in it except for junk
<HyperMetalLugia> though
<CCCP> is tempted to spam copypasta
<Gunthler> BLAZE!

Be specific; use examples, and make a plan for implimentation.
