<Oposdeo> I love me some oippoutounetei? I don't know.
<Shadow_Phantom> do it in japanese
<mlPony73496> i like it better than english but its weird
<EmperorOfMankind> rainbow dash's voice
<kirzstryfe> I used to, not sure who's getting stuck in there now
<pony_9017> If they were French they would have surrendered during the competition.
<Cherri> Le Derpeh
<MakerDusk> c'est bien, ]c
<altonyc> The romance languages generally sound better sung than English. Germanic...not so much.
<aarosaurstrings99> they should put latin
<Stary> Way better in French lol
<Fictive> SPIDER PONIES
<PuebloDoG> Wouldn't it be weird if they were actually cursing through the song and no one fluent was the wiser
<SkyeSpark> Better than english
<Tomo> time for s1 and 2 sub'd french
<Stary> Makes sense...
<MakerDusk> *ça
<Tomo> cuz classy
<Cabrony> french is the total opposite of america
<siddelthekiddel> Y'know what's scary?
<princess-loveless> quel est cet engin si particulier :o
<PonyAnt> someone needs to do this in cosplay at a con
<aarosaurstrings99> it sounds good
<Stary> But English is my most favored language
<siddelthekiddel> Romanian ponies... D:
<Warden> America isn't a language
<Dr_Fumbles> I like English better
<Username> MON DIEU!
<PinkamenaDianePie> Germanic isn't a Romance language. . .
<Excadrill> German sounds better growled
<Buytoast> alright, place bets now
<pony_7560> altonyc The German version of the show is awesome!
<SirMcBacon> Auf deutsch?
<SilverHoof> OMMELETTE DU FROMAGE
<altonyc> exactly
<jackdoe720> why, siddlethekiddel?
<Stary> Mainly because I can't understand too much French XD
<twistandshout> I quite like this.
<Buytoast> next episode is A Friend in Deed
<princess-loveless> its french dumbies
<SilverHoof> OMMELETTE DU FROMAGE
<pony_5839> Main Six's voices are so bad in pretty much all dubs except the original english
<siddelthekiddel> Because.
<Buytoast> i'm bettin 20 bucks
<SilverHoof> OMMELETTE DU FROMAGE
<siddelthekiddel> It's just scary.

<siddelthekiddel> Romanian At the Gala.
<NinjazzMobile> Good Luck to whoever is.
<thelonepony> Buytoast: 10 bits :3
<Excadrill> See: Panzerchrist. i haven't heard a more brutal approach to vocals ever
<Rambo> lololol
<Polydunami> Germanic isn't even a language; it's a GROUP of languages :S
<Brightlilly> Ican understand it because i know the original lyrics
<Theakman> italian intro theme is amazing
<Oposdeo> rarity loves a good buisness man
<siddelthekiddel> Rarity doesn't even sing. *youmad*
<aarosaurstrings99> is great
<Stary> Though Fluttershy's scream in Spanish is a lie!
<ISky> Romanian Winter Wrap-Up sounds like it'd be Dragostea Din Tea all over again
<altonyc> Germanic is NOT romantic language. German sounds great spoken, but the phonetics don't work as well for singing.
<twistandshout> Freundschaft is Magie still isn't as bad as Swedish MLP
<Penscribe> oh geez, at the gala in romanian is weird ><
<BlazingStreak> I can't get over how well this fits...
<pony_4913> why is the episode in french :C?
<Stary> They didn't get the joke...
