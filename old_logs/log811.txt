<Neotyguy40> Not straight, gay, bi, etc.
<Canadian_Brony> I'll be back in a few minutes. Gonna do some stuff and set up my good computer.

<Saturn> 08,01Barbetos: classy
<Canadian_Brony> no
<Canadian_Brony> Shizucave
<Barbetos> My mic was ready, but my recording software was not
<Barbetos> Infact my burp bluescreened my other computer in the hall.
<Neotyguy40> Seems normal to me
<Barbetos> And cased my dog off
<Barbetos> Also the front door is missing.
<Barbetos> Oh no. Wiat. That was just my ex.
<AttackWithHugs> Dayum, Barbetos. What'd you drink?
<EggNog5000> Barbetos: it was the burp the legends spoke of! you are indeed the chosen one
<Meth> oh
<DiscSlash> dat lab
<Barbetos> That kind of burp just secured my after life in valhala
<Saturn> 08,01mfw my simulation is heating my laptop up to 93C

<Barbetos> I think he is insane

<Meth> So, this guy came up to me and called me a Trigga
<Neotyguy40> Mah trigga
<thelonepony> Saturn: Damn
<Spyrorocks> was someone trying to talk to me
<pinkiepoop> How many people are usually in a minecraft server?
<Saturn> 08,01Barbetos: i'm not too worried; airflow on this laptop is terrible, so i just need to position it near a window or something
<pony_4908> Minigolems!

*otakon smacks Saturn on the nose with a rolled up magazine
<Bronysith> Saturn: hes my property master
*otakon dodges the tackle hug
<Kandarihu> Saturn, I'm content enough to just elevate my laptop a bit off the table. That gives it much better airflow.
<otakon> I am no one property
*Saturn 08,01hugs otakon's tackle
<ThunderBlaze> A MAYYAANNNN
*Bronysith takes otakon to bed
<thelonepony> Ohai otakon :)

<Barbetos> FLCL was an excpetion if I remember correctly.
<derpy_h> well this mod is part of tekkit though
<RainbowPengy> well its the single player vers of tekkit also known as technic
<RainbowPengy> oh
<RainbowPengy> xD
<jcelios> derpy_h: both Tekkit and Feed the Beast are complilations of lots of different mods

<Bronysith> cause why the fuck not
<Bronysith> Shizuka: are you going to build a model EVA?
<jcelios> it will mine obsidian though, so flooding your quarry actually makes it go "through" lava in a sense
<Bronysith> or shizumobile whoever gets pinged XD
<derpy_h> i preffer combustion over redstone energy
<Barbetos> This all reminds me of Dwarf Fort XD
<Barbetos> Such a good game.

<Kandarihu> So, this is from the Thaumacraft mod?
<Sumica> 00,10that'ssssssssssss a niccccccce factory
<otakon> Bronysith: jokes on you, I can't see shit without my glasses
<Buytoast> would be a shame if it were...
<otakon> Sumica: you know better than that she has no enemies in there
<Buytoast> UNIONIZED
<Barbetos> All that evangelion cures your vision I bet.
<derpy_h> baCK
<Bronysith> otakon: jokes on you, the tv screen is a prescription to your eyes specifically, and even then you will still here shinjis whining and screaming
<XAX> that's so gaben
<Kandarihu> Roast beef
<Buytoast> yes
<derpy_h> NOT THE BABIES
<Buytoast> burn them
<AttackWithHugs> Not the moo moos
<jcelios> TV screen prescription to someone's eyes? I don't think it works that way XD
<Buytoast> make them pay for their wicked plots of dmonation
<EggNog5000> goodnight everyone :)
<Shizuka> 13see
<Shizuka> 13i breed the cows
<otakon> COWS
<Shizuka> 13then i kill their parents in front of them
<otakon> babbi cows!
<Shizuka> 13it makes them tougher
<Shizuka> 13and better leather
<otakon> Shizuka: MURDERER!
<Sumica> 00,10mars attacks
<Kandarihu> AttackWithHugs, these are livestock. The one thing you should never do with livestock is grow attached to them.
<thelonepony> :D
<otakon> SuperBrony64: LOOK AT WHAT SHIZU DOES!
<CrystalPhoenix> anyone has that urging feeling of doing silly faces while looking into a mirror?
<Bronysith> Shizuka: youve been watching too much evangelion
<otakon> CrystalPhoenix: like Pinkie? nah
<Buytoast> but what happens when you go too far and one of them becomes Cowman Shizuka?
<Stormy> lol, aw
<thelonepony> :D
<Sumica> 00,10SUPER COW
<derpy_h> SUPER SHEEP
<Randomnerd> Or ManCow? That dude is a terrible DJ.
<Spyrorocks> :P
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, so mental trauma strengthens their bodies?
<Bronysith> otakon: im watching FLCL right now...what the fuck is going on?
<Stormy> missed an interesting conversation I see
<Bronysith> otakon: is this supposed to be taken seriously?
<jcelios> "scat"?
<Randomnerd> Bronysith: I don't think so....
<Spyrorocks> not really too interesting
<Neotyguy40> Boring
<derpy_h> dawwww
<Barbetos> closenuff
<Neotyguy40> Girl problems
<Randomnerd> otakon: You ever see Sword Arts Online?
<ThunderBlaze> I am still fiddiling around with Fruity Loops Studio
<ThunderBlaze> It's hard to use
<jcelios> FLCL makes complete sense you just have to watch it on mountains of DMT
<Stormy> that was mostly sarcasm :P
<Bronysith> jcelios: so drugs?
<Buytoast> what in the hell are those
<Buytoast> good god
<Buytoast> they move
<Bronysith> yes
<Bronysith> they float
<Kandarihu> I was late to read Shizuka explaining why she slaughtered the cows. Man, slaughtering them for their meat is normally neded for survival and market. But, making orphans out of the young? What the HECK!?
<jcelios> Bronysith: hay brah DMT is completely natural
<Bronysith> jcelios: so drugs
<jcelios> Bronysith: fight the powah!
<Stormy> I never dated in high school so I wouldn't have been good for advice anyways
<Kandarihu> Er, orphans just to traumatize them, that's what bugs me.
<Bronysith> ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH
<Bronysith> god i love gurren lagann
<Bronysith> so much that i need to get a kamina body pillow
<ThunderBlaze> hmm yess wicthes brew
<Bronysith> and yoko
<Bronysith> so that its not gay
<ThunderBlaze> Kawaii Desu desu
<jcelios> -_^
<Bronysith> oh who am i kidding
<Bronysith> Kamina is the sexiest thing ever
<jcelios> is it the glasses?
<Bronysith> nope
<Barbetos> The more I stare the less I understand.
<Bronysith> the personality jcelios
<Barbetos> shizu the potions masta
<ThunderBlaze> Why does this remind me of Runsescape?
<Bronysith> personally, i think everyone needs a kamina in their life, someone to punch you
<Bronysith> tell you to get over it and move on in your life
<Barbetos> Yeah I have that.
<derpy_h> suddenly the cow army comes
<jcelios> oh right gurren lagann is the one with spiral enery and robots the size of galaxies XD
<derpy_h> and moos sihizuka too death
<Bronysith> jcelios: 1% of the universe
<Barbetos> I start to bitch and moan and he looks me right in the eyes, and starts whining obnoxiously
<Barbetos> And it reminds me not to be so serious.
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/TLKKb everyone knows this needed to happen

<Cypresswolf> She took us on a tour of her magical minecraft world :)
<ThunderBlaze> Something smells like burning hair
<Kencolt> Bronysith: It wouldn't have worked. Shinji is so damn broken that Kamina would walk away somewhat depressed and Simon would actually develop an early ego.
<ThunderBlaze> OH CRAP THATS MY ARM!
<derpy_h> suddenly the cow army starts advancing on shizukas jome
*NocturnalBlade hugs thelonepony and noms hims...gives additional hugs to AttackWithHugs ThunderBlaze and texasboykc09

<ThunderBlaze> So what's next?
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/OUGDN.jpg everyones reactions after watching EoE
<ThunderBlaze> ... is there maybe a way i might be able to do a livestream?
<Bronysith> ThunderBlaze: nope
<Bronysith> no
<Bronysith> nope
<Bronysith> never
<ThunderBlaze> Darn
<Bronysith> only mods
<Saturn> 08,01what's EoE?
<Kencolt> Strictly Mods only. Very strictly.
<Bronysith> Saturn: end of evangelion
<Bronysith> Saturn: AKA mindfuck central
<Derpy_Hooves> called it
<otakon> Saturn: End of Evangelion aka "WHAT THE FUCK?"
<ThunderBlaze> It might be impossible to ask but is there maybe some Mod applications?
<Saturn> 08,01surely, it can' tbe that bad?
<Bronysith> otakon: AKA 2 hour metaphor for masturbation
<ThunderBlaze> I was actually an admin for a TF2 server
<derpy_h> it is that bad
<ThunderBlaze> Yumozfuntastic server
<otakon> Bronysith: with REALLY REALLY drawn out animation shots of them doing NOTHING
<Saturn> 08,01ThunderBlaze: we're not currently looking, but e-mail us an application anyway
<jcelios> Bronysith: I thought it was a metaphor for the russian revolution
<otakon> derpy_h: it's all over the place in terms of quality really
<Bronysith> otakon: still quite an experience
<Derpy_Hooves> ThunderBlaze: modding bronystate is VERY different than modding a TF2 server
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: its not that its bad, although it is quite pretentious, its just really weird and mindbuckery
<ThunderBlaze> IT maybe is but i am willing to learn
<Kencolt> Saturn: Basically, take Evangelion-- a clasic WTF series. Make a movie that promises to explain the ending. Have it do... nothing of the sort whatsoever and instead raise the WTF levels to heights formerly undreamed of on this crude earth.
<Bronysith> otakon: cause it being gainax, the animation, is actually good at some key parts
<otakon> Derpy_Hooves: for one, no massive Sasha to put people in their place
<otakon> Bronysith: exactly
<ThunderBlaze> IS ther anyone doing another stream or is this it for now?
<Derpy_Hooves> otakon: wut?
<Kencolt> Saturn: And then be Hideki Anno, and insist that damn it, it DOES explain it anyway.
<thelonepony> ThunderBlaze: for now
<otakon> honestly I don't like NGE for how goddamn depressing it is in general
<Bronysith> otakon: cause even if you hate NGE, you cant deny it has great animation moments
<otakon> yeah it does
<otakon> much to my chagrin
<Bronysith> Cause well...Gainax
<Cypresswolf> chugging the last of my stein, then off to bed - Cheers Everyone
<otakon> HOWEVER! GL tops them

<ThunderBlaze> XXD maybe
<ThunderBlaze> I will let you know one thing
<Stormy> I am still a beginner at php
<ThunderBlaze> If you guys maybe wondering
<Stormy> but that'd be cool
<ThunderBlaze> I am good at 2 things
<Shizuka> 13trolls are uncreative sad creatures
<Yahooz> ThunderBlaze: i wasnt wondering

<Yahooz> Shizuka: minus dari
<Stormy> whose voice was that :P

<DiscSlash> all of my lols
<ThunderBlaze> XD nice
<Sp8ers> i was hoping counter-striking

<Yahooz> THAT MUST BE HIGH ON THE CREDENTIAL LIST
<ThunderBlaze> Yeah he got banned for it
<killerpony7733> Trolling is not being a douche and just making insults and offensive jokes
<ThunderBlaze> XD
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: http://du.cx/files/CS4202_P1___Report.pdf
<killerpony7733> Trolling is actually being comedically funny
<killerpony7733> Making people laugh
<AppleBloom> lol freebird was waiting for like 20 minutes to continue playing
<Shizuka> 13no that's comedy
<AppleBloom> skynyrd has didication
<Yahooz> Shizuka: i would suggest not making your disspaointment visable. It seems thats what every troll on here wants from you
<AppleBloom> dedication*
<Shizuka> 13trolling is irritating other people for nothing more than your own enjoyment
<Shizuka> 13Yahooz: yeah except i'm in the position that removes them from the field :)
<Buytoast> the yellow car knows no mercy
<Saturn> 08,01i've become somewhat renowned in the e CS department here for using Mandelbrot fractals in examples
<Shizuka> 13oo look shizu so mad, wait what's the big hammer for
<Saturn> 08,01a lot.
<DiscSlash> why you guys are talking about trolls, lets forget that and have fun

<Shizuka> 13that turns to stone in daylight
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> No shizu no!
<Shizuka> 13see
<Yahooz> Shizuka: they still leave with the satisfaction
<Shizuka> 13trolls never go outside
<otakon1> lol
<Ryunosuke> is it a good troll, or a newb wannabe troll? :)
<Shizuka> 13because they would turn to stone

<Saturn> 08,01i love that i can compress 200MB trace files down to about 300k
<Saturn> 08,01no need to fear .h if you use header guards
<Yahooz> anyway, night guys

<Shizuka> 13yeah cpp made things easy
<AttackWithHugs> .h?
<Buytoast> aint that header stuff?
<Shizuka> 13the book i was reading was not very helpful in understanding quite why you would do certain things
<Saturn> 08,01i wish bzip2 could execute across multiple cores
<Shizuka> 13had a debug header that injected magic logging methods you could call
<Stormy> he only said 1 through 3

<Kurra> Saturn
<Kurra> I shall have to read your paper later
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> DiscSlash: My response to trolls http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5147/
<Saturn> 08,01hey Kurra
<Shizuka> 13oh saturn did i tell you about the open source forensics class i took once
<Shizuka> 13three hour class
<Shizuka> 13we often spent two hours using dd
<Kurra> but be careful
<Shizuka> 13because he used different images every week
<DiscSlash> wow spade thats actually my spray in tf2 lol
<Saturn> 08,01heh
<Saturn> 08,01good ol' dd
<Shizuka> 13nothing like wasting the majority of your class waiting for dd
<Saturn> 08,01sounds like spight's RHCE classes
<Shizuka> 13somehow i passed that class too even though i can't remember us actually doing anything
<Kurra> Saturn, there are many around the world on the internets that would steal such a paper.
<Kurra> I won't understand it but i'll almost learn somethign from it!
<Saturn> 08,01Kurra: it's just a practical for my course
<Kurra> C:
<Saturn> 08,01if someone stole it, it'd be flagged up on turnitin
<Saturn> 08,01which most unis use
<Shizuka> 13the intro forensics class was cooler though, the final exam was reconstructing the directory tree of a corrupted floppy with diskedit
<Kurra> :D
<Saturn> 08,01but if people want to read and learn from it, they are very welcome to
<Stormy> Hello again
<Kurra> well, lots don't, and anyway lots of stolen/sold papers always get through, in the places I've been :<
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy I know, those are the live extensions

<NocturnalBlade> bye DiscSlash
<DiscSlash> bye y'all
<Stormy> I'd do the same if I didn't have to take notes on "Science and Theology: An Introduction" by John Polkinghorne
<Shizuka> 13he's ugly but he's pretty too
<Shizuka> 13nahmean
<pony_7777> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> he is wise, yet he is foolish
<Stormy> Polkinghorne references himself in the third person a lot, it's really weird
<Shizuka> 13new project codename get
<Shizuka> 13"what's your software called"
<Shizuka> 13"nahmean"
<Phase4> 00,02http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillows_and_Blankets this is whats on tv
<twilight_sprinkle> nahmean jayden, EF BEE AYE
<AppleBloom> OMG
<AppleBloom> AM I HEARING THAT!?
<Shizuka> 13phelps badge 1247 nahmean?
<pony_7777> dig the custom tracks
<AppleBloom> No!!! The tunes! The tunes are gone! :'(
<twilight_sprinkle> i know guy a who knows phelps personally
<Shizuka> 13in that segment, the buddha is holding a cameraphone, nahmean?
<Phase4> 00,02how would you pronounce nahmean
<twilight_sprinkle> dat turret song
<twilight_sprinkle> nah meen?
<twilight_sprinkle> im just guessin
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: well you say it with a bit of a slur, but not too much twang nahmena?
<Phase4> 00,02when guns are easier to work than a camera, either something is very right or very wrong
<pony_7777> yeah, gut kinda no. nahmean?
<TrixieTheMagnificent> Phase4 well guns are just point and shoot, cameras can't do that
<pony_7777> *but
<Goldframe> this the movie version or the TV version of ROD?
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, doesnt look right to me, though hn is dificult to pronounce anyway
<Phase4> 00,02dat zoom
<Phase4> 00,02if that was a real camera those guys would be grey bloobs merged into other grey bloobs
<NocturnalBlade> well that was easy
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: it's a corruption of "know what i mean", where "know what i" collapses into "nah"
<Shizuka> 13it's more like nah-ih-mean
<Phase4> 00,02 o_O
<Stormy> yay, done
<Stormy> Good night anyone who's still here
<pony_7777> you should ask roman to go bowling
<Shizuka> 13american english is scary
<AppleBloom> why?
<Shizuka> 13oh sumi isn't further than me after all
<Shizuka> 13was just doing side missions
<Shizuka> 13i hadn't touched francis or packie yet
<Shizuka> 13hey since he's in your spot i wonder if you get to keep the cop car

<Buytoast> The free way is trying to stab you.
<Buytoast> Run Sumica.
<Goldframe> helicopter
<Goldframe> at least until you lost it
<AppleBloom> I think this is how sumica feels http://www.google.com/imgres?q=mlp+luna&um=1&hl=en&tbo=d&rlz=1C1DVCJ_enUS423US490&biw=1280&bih=933&tbm=isch&tbnid=zZUsj1MAC_q44M:&imgrefurl=http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic/images/30730587/title/luna-photo&docid=HVUp7WX9RQAVRM&imgurl=http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/30700000/Luna-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-30730587-1600-1224.png&w=1600&h=1224&ei=-xTQUIz

<TrixieTheMagnificent> Shizuka the real question is why no one links the actual pic instead of the google search
<NocturnalBlade> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> well its hard to see how big a link because you only see the limited url bar size
<AppleBloom> well with that embarrasment im off to bed, again sorry
<twilight_sprinkle> night AppleBloom
<NocturnalBlade> nite AppleBloom
<Ryunosuke> thats why you close the image link to the actual image as I did, or derpy.me or similar shortening url
<Shizuka> 13i like how they all look worse in suits than niko does
<AttackWithHugs> Dayum

<CountDoofus> Haio KrazyNoobs
<NocturnalBlade> ohai KrazyNoobs
<LightTrooper105> hallo KrazyNoobs
<Chrysalis> thats a nice payday
<KrazyNoobs> I wonder why absolutely NO information about Season 3 Episode 8 has been released
<Chrysalis> 5* current finances
<Chrysalis> KrazyNoobs no spoilers
<Chrysalis> its an instant ban
<NocturnalBlade> Ok guys, i shall go hit the hay...good night, thanks for the stream Sumica and see yall later :)
<CountDoofus> !cd
<Tom> Episode 8 of season 3 "Apple Family Reunion" airs in 4 days, 7 hours, 40 minutes, 46 seconds (Dec 22 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<KrazyNoobs> It isnt a spoiler. Saying that there are no spoilers isn't a spoiler in itself
<Chrysalis> i swear
<Chrysalis> i keep adding tom to ignore
<Chrysalis> and he keeps coming through
<LightTrooper105> NocturnalBlade night
<Chrysalis> damnit
<KrazyNoobs> I don't think admins could be ignored... you wouldn't want to do that anyway, as about 80% of what most of them say is important.
<Chrysalis> im fed up of title spoilers from tom
<Shizuka> 13yay two cop cars now
<LightTrooper105> collect all the cop cars!
<Chrysalis> iv had more spoilers from tom than anything else
<KrazyNoobs> Chrysalis: Isn't it a little hardcore to keep yourself from seeing the ACTUAL title of the episode?
<Chrysalis> KrazyNoobs i like it to be as much as a supprise as possible
<Chrysalis> but yes i even try to avoid the titles
<KrazyNoobs> Ah, then you should be happy, as we don't even know the title of the new episode...
<Pinkies4thWall> Chrysalis: you mean the episode names?
<Chrysalis> Pinkies4thWall same thing
<Pinkies4thWall> Yeah, that is a bummer finding out names to me
<CountDoofus> First time playing, Sumi?
*Pinkies4thWall needs cider
<Pinkies4thWall> NAO
<CountDoofus> Just curious what your decision at the end was, money or vengeance. :$

<Chrysalis> hmm, is that bug still there which let non mods use colours?
<Chrysalis> or did you all get it fixed now
<Chrysalis> right its been fixed
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: did you switch your pings? And because you are screwy with the little green guys. that's why
<Pinkies4thWall> Ah.
<KrazyNoobs> At least it's light...
<KrazyNoobs> but not too aerodynamic
<Moopy> Howdy everypony
<CountDoofus> Haio Moopy
<KrazyNoobs> Hi Moopy
<Moopy> hi
<Pinkies4thWall> I just ate 100 slices of pepperoni...
<CountDoofus> Spaaaaaaaace!
<Pinkies4thWall> I feel kinda weird
<KrazyNoobs> There is no air in space, meaning no wind resistance, meaning no use for aerodynamic design once it is up there.
<Goldframe> it's a miracle?
<Pinkies4thWall> KrazyNoobs: yes there is
<Pinkies4thWall> It looks cool
<anonymousbrony747133> hello?
<Pinkies4thWall> hello
<pony_7777> Pinkies4thWall: and you're not sick?

<twilight_sprinkle> Pinkies4thWall: you probably wont if you actually ate 100 pieces. start preparing now, eat stuff to prevent stomach pain
<Pinkies4thWall> TO THE CIDER!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> Pinkies4thWall: but not random kind of stuff of course
<Pinkies4thWall> Cider is never random
<Pinkies4thWall> Because PONIES
<Moopy> So i herd that in minecraft that you can make a TNT canon right?

<Drew> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> but what if they have mondays in hell
<Shizuka> 13yes but the TNT itself should be in a water flow block
<Shizuka> 13obsidian is resistant, the redstone you'll use to detonate it is not

<DemoPegono> Sup, Arcium and SuperBrony64.
<djblazekin> @wreck what faction are you with
<Arcium> Dat slow loading :D
<AdamTheDuck> djblazekin, we're on Woodman server and playing witht he NC
<djblazekin> my pc can run it on low everything smoothly
<Arcium> djblasekin : Slow pc maybe?
<djblazekin> nah i have an athlon x2 5000+ and a geforce 6150
<DemoPegono> o3e
<djblazekin> 2gb ddr2 ram
<Arcium> djbazekin : i5-750 4ghz oc, gtx xfx 260 50%oc :D
<djblazekin> so i need an i5 or higher
<Arcium> djblazekin: naaah i think you need a better graphics card :P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02oi
<djblazekin> what would you recomend i only have $100 for entertainment
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek nintendo /)^3^(\
*Petrified_Discord is shocked
<CountDoofus> Just found the best video ever. Too bad I can't link it atm :P
<djblazekin> i dont do mutch pc gaming i'm mostly on consoles
<DemoPegono> WiiU is awesome.
<JRP2234> wii u was a flop
<DemoPegono> Nope.
<JRP2234> yeo
<Arcium> djblazekin : If you play on consoles, you really dont need a better graphics card :D
<djblazekin> since this is by soe then i'll wait for a ps3 release
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DemoPegono: IKR O3O
<sweetie2> sup guys. What is this game?
<djblazekin> planetside 2
<DemoPegono> For me, it actually did what the PS3 and XBox 360 could not do.
<DemoPegono> There's even Batman: Arkham City in the WiiU.
<Arcium> Bye ^
<Arcium> ^^
<djblazekin> technicly if you have a vita you can do a tabletesc wiiu like expierence on ps3
<djblazekin> is this a pc exclusive @wreck
<DemoPegono> But does it have a bigger screen? Enough to actually NOT force your eyes out?
<djblazekin> the wii u could
<DemoPegono> Heck, WiiU gives a touchpad screen, PERFECT for games like Scriibblenauts.
<djblazekin> i think a wiiu release of this on eshop would be great
*DemoPegono shrugs
<djblazekin> the touchpad would have the map
<DemoPegono> If you want to use the touch screen of the WiiU in an awesome way, then play it with that new Lego detective game.

<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Eeyup
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I still don't get the hate the female rival gets :|
<Gold_Demona> She's just kinda dumb, and people have a tendency to hate characters that are kinda dumb and exaggerate the crap out of her dumbness. :P
<Saturn> 08,01i want to watch some gargoyles now
<Saturn> 08,01and it's your fault, Gold_Demona

<AdamTheDuck> ;~; So I buy my niece a crystal pony version of Rainbow Dash that comes with a crystal Tank
<Saturn> 08,01# when i was 25 i was a rock star, but it didn't pay too well i had to strip on the side, of the road to get ready for shows and the cars driving by, baby they'd never know, what a bargain they'd gotten #
<AdamTheDuck> for Christmas
<AdamTheDuck> and she throws away Rainbow Dash and plays with Tank ;~;
<aniderp_downstairs> D:
<Gold_Demona> LOL Oh geez
<aniderp_downstairs> did you take the dash?
<AdamTheDuck> and now my brother is giving me strange looks for buying myself Rarity and Lyra XD

<aniderp_downstairs> stupidkeyboard
<JRP2234> wrek im downloading ps2
<Gold_Demona> No, being depressed and gloomy isn't going to do anything for you. In fact, it will have the opposite effect. It will just make things worse.
<AdamTheDuck> Pfft lighten up Jmo, you're always so tight :P
<JRP2234> not to be confused with ps2 playstation 2
<Jmo> There is a time and place. Learn it.

<Gold_Demona> It's a machine, not a puppy
<Jmo> You really need help.
<aniderp_downstairs> eletronics are mylife
<aniderp_downstairs> ;_;
<Saturn> 08,01aniderp_downstairs: what a shallow life, then. read a book
<Gold_Demona> ^
<Malavolent> Become obsessed with books instead.
<Saturn> 08,01seriously, get yourself a copy of Illium by Dan Simmons
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Malavolent> You can read them when there is blackout.
<Saturn> 08,01or Hitchhiker's Guide
<Saturn> 08,01or Discworld
<Saturn> 08,01or any of the millions of other great books there are out there
<AdamTheDuck> Try Angels and Demons by Dan Brown
<aniderp_downstairs> howabout manga?
<Saturn> 08,01read an Oscar Wilde play
<Gold_Demona> Manga's good too. They're books
<Saturn> 08,01seriously, Oscar Wilde is hilarious
<Malavolent> aniderp_downstairs: Don't.
<aniderp_downstairs> only type i willread
<Gold_Demona> bad
<Gold_Demona> Limiting yourself is bad
<AdamTheDuck> Malavolent, nothing wrong with manga .-.
<aniderp_downstairs> or dragons and wolves
<Gold_Demona> Mangas are good, but are not the only good books out there.
<Saturn> 08,01aniderp_downstairs: you're really missing out, then
<Gold_Demona> ^
<Malavolent> AdamTheDuck: I prefer ordinary books to mangas.
<aniderp_downstairs> iread dragon book
<aniderp_downstairs> does reading guidebooks count?
<AdamTheDuck> Malavolent, and I too also prefer a good old novel from time to time, but there is nothing wrong with manga.
<Malavolent> I've read one manga in my whole life because the anime wasn't finished.
<Saturn> 08,01aniderp_downstairs: well, have you read anything by Anne McCaffrey?
<aniderp_downstairs> no?
<Gold_Demona> Ann McCaffrey's books are awesome
<Gold_Demona> Dragonriders!
<Gold_Demona> People who ride frickin dragons!
<aniderp_downstairs> oooo
<Malavolent> AdamTheDuck: I don't say manga is bad, but you don't have to use your imagination at all.
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: So?
<Saturn> 08,01aniderp_downstairs: would you like me to buy you the first book in the series?
<aniderp_downstairs> gotta go
<Saturn> 08,01pm me your address and i will
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: The best thing about books is that you can create the whole world in your imagination.
<AdamTheDuck> Bye aniderp_downstairs
*Saturn 08,01likes spreading good stories
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Yes, but that's a whole other animal from comics, though. The point of reading a manga is more for the visual experience.
<AdamTheDuck> Malavolent, and illustrations help
<AdamTheDuck> It's different, I guess it's not for all
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: I agree, but I don't know, manga has never given me any feels at all.
<Gold_Demona> And sometimes, it's nice to have the full scope of the scene without sludging through pages of descriptions before getting to the action.
<Gold_Demona> *coughTOLKIENcough*
<AdamTheDuck> Hehe, I remember my friend telling me about novels like that
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: British books in general, I'd say.
<Malavolent> Great stories, but you have to understand a load of information to actually get it.
<AdamTheDuck> Having 3 pages of description explaining the cave, then having the characters simply travel through it
<Gold_Demona> I made it a point to read through The Hobbit and all of Lord of the Rings before watching the Lord of the Rings movies. :>
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai oni_link
<Barbetos> What server did everyone end up getting on?
<AdamTheDuck> Barbetos, Woodman
<Barbetos> sounds made up
<Barbetos> =P
<Gold_Demona> Spending half of the first chapter describing Bilbo's house, including a pause to talk about his obsession with maps, only for him to leave on an adventure and we don't see the house again until the very end of the story. :P
<oni_link> Can't wait to get on this game. Get paid in two days and I can finally get my tower
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, uhh I didn'
<oni_link> I already ordered my videocard too :3
<AdamTheDuck> t have enough patience to read the hobit history in the first Lord of the Rings book XD
<AdamTheDuck> accidently pressed enter before finishing
<Gold_Demona> The Hobbit history? I was just talking about The Hobbit. :P
<AdamTheDuck> So... I just bought myself 50 Shades of Grey...
<Gold_Demona> Uh oh
<Gold_Demona> Why?
<AdamTheDuck> Haven't read the first page yet
<Barbetos> Already horny too.
<AdamTheDuck> A friend wanted to read it but didn't have enough oney
<AdamTheDuck> so I bought it and was going to let him read it
<AdamTheDuck> but I'm just going to read it first then let her read it :P
<AdamTheDuck> money*
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<AdamTheDuck> Why did I write him then her? .-.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<AdamTheDuck> Uhh I think I should probably get some shut eye
<Gold_Demona> Go to bread, Ducky
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> The little Sumi that could?
<oni_link> Looks soo fun
<oni_link> Its vertical by the way
<AdamTheDuck> You know, Meaanwhile actually sounds angry all the time XD
<oni_link> hah
<Phase4> this game looks very prety
<oni_link> I know right Phase4 ?
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, too bad it is very unoptimised
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, most games are
<AdamTheDuck> ooh I should probably try and get KSP running on my PC ;~;
<AdamTheDuck> What did you PM me when I was shutting off my PC at 02:00 in the morning Phase4? :$
<oni_link> Can anyone help me out in choosing a good cooling solution for a kit I'm buying?
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, i pm'd you?
<AdamTheDuck> Not sure, I was too sleepy to check
<AdamTheDuck> Or was it 4 am?
<Phase4> 2 hour eta on my download of this game :(
<AdamTheDuck> Oh cool Hexchat keeps logs
<oni_link> Phase4, it looks like its worth it at least :)
<Jmo> Go to sleep already you twat.
<Gold_Demona> Mojay y u so mean? D:
<AdamTheDuck> Uhh, I'll sleep later Jmo :P
<AdamTheDuck> Trying to get KSP running
<Phase4> Jmo, you sleep
<Jmo> It's 2038
<Jmo> I slept for 5 hours previously.
<oni_link> how much is a cheap but decent liquid cooler gonna cost me?
<oni_link> *cpu
<Phase4> yeah, no colisions on that
<Phase4> colision mesh is almost always different to the displayed mesh
<Phase4> road trip!
<the_real_pony_1604> the one I have, the H80 is around 90 bucks depending on where you get it
<Phase4> the_real_pony_1604 from nowhere
<the_real_pony_1604> been here all along. ;)
<oni_link> the_real_pony_1604: where did you get yours?

<AdamTheDuck> JRP2234, go to bread
<XAX> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1355829113057.gif
<oni_link> ah alright I was looking at this one, don't know if it was any good the_real_pony_1604 http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=7335485&CatId=499
<the_real_pony_1604> it was on sale at the time but looks to be a little more now, oni_lin
<the_real_pony_1604> it would work, I looked at it when I was shopping. but wanted the dual fan control of the H80
<the_real_pony_1604> my only recommendation is make for SURE you have room for it. I had to take the heat sync off one of my ram sticks to fit it
<Phase4> how many people are there in this game?
<the_real_pony_1604> you should join them Phase, they have been having problems
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, a couple hundred a server
<Phase4> clearly a man with 280 ping is what they need :P
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, pfft, ping isn't a big deal, everyone lags so it's even :P
<AdamTheDuck> Even the Australian servers lag because they are based in America still >.>
<Phase4> i hadrly blame them, have you seen what it costs to host servers here?
<Phase4> its absurd
<AdamTheDuck> Did stream die?
<Gold_Demona> nope
<Phase4> i paid $50 to get a vps for a year in the US
<Phase4> to get anywhere near the power that vps has i'd need to pay twice that a month
<Phase4> here in aus i meen
<Gold_Demona> Yeesh
<the_real_pony_1604> no, what is absurd is Google has a facility in Oklahoma that is a full one for one backup of their main server farm. it has never been activated and is only maned by 6 people to clean the floors and blow dust out
<Phase4> i have no idea why they charge so much
<Phase4> the_real_pony_1604, imagine if google actually goes down though
<Phase4> they cant afford that
<Phase4> though i'd imagine the facility is doing something
<Phase4> you don't hold that many servers offline, no point
<Kurra> mornin' all :>
<Phase4> morning
<the_real_pony_1604> from what I have been told by people that live in the area it hasn't. but I do understand why it is there
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' Kurra

<oni_link> hai
<the_real_pony_1604> oni_link, I have a 3930k. have had no problems yet with it. and I can definitely tell when it kicks in the fans for added cooling.
<oni_link> the_real_pony_1604: guess Ill go with it just to be safe
<oni_link> sounds like it doesnt hurt to have that dual just in case
<Saturn> 08,01i'im thinking of getting one of the 2nd generation core i chips
<Saturn> 08,01but the only reason really is that i want to play around with the new AVX instructions
<oni_link> Saturn: Im gonna get this kit http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=7496894&CatId=4910
<the_real_pony_1604> well, like I said, make for SURE you have room for it. I have a very large case and it was an extremely tight fit
<oni_link> in the very least, I know its the same socket
<oni_link> lol
<Saturn> 08,01oni_link: not bad
*Saturn 08,01pretty much only uses a laptop now
*Gold_Demona plucks a candy cane off the Christmas tree and eats it. :>
<oni_link> Im happy, I can finally get off this laptop and do some real gaming :3
<Saturn> 08,01but it's a 17" with an i5 430
<Saturn> 08,01*430m
<Saturn> 08,01and a gtx330 graphics chip
<Saturn> 08,01so it does everything i require of it
<oni_link> Oh yours is awesome, mine is dated. Its pretty much only good for watching videos and basic web browsing...
<JRP2234> Saturn what are some of the great fps's back in the 90's excluding doom duke nukem rott heretic and hexen
<oni_link> small hard drive, older graphics solution etc
<Saturn> 08,01i was playing Portal 2 in Linux using Wine the other day
<Saturn> 08,01worked pretty well
<oni_link> nice :)
<Saturn> 08,01JRP2234: witchaven, shadowcaster
<Saturn> 08,01catacomb abyss
<the_real_pony_1604> I LOVED shadowcaster back in the day
<Alma> 1 Dota 2 code? lol, I have 8 already, but no friends :(
<Saturn> 08,01ultima underworld
<Saturn> 08,01JRP2234: oh, and of course, Descent!
<oni_link> my laptop dies trying to get a steady fps on doat 2 XD
<oni_link> *DOTA 2
<Saturn> 08,01also, can't forget the Quake series
<JRP2234> thx Saturn i must try them out
<Gold_Demona> Quake was awesome
<JRP2234> i lovw quake
<Alma> Republicans are geniuses. Just now I heard that one republican moaned that the female teacher in that school did not have a gun in her desk
<Alma> The problem with guns will be solved - WITH MORE GUNS
<JRP2234> the muiltyplayer was fast and fun
<AdamTheDuck> Politics and BronyState, >.<
<Saturn> 08,01JRP2234: goldeneye was the 90s too
<JRP2234> the n64?
<Saturn> 08,01oh oh! star wars: dark forces!
<Gold_Demona> I never played Goldeneye, but I heard awesome stories. :>
<Saturn> 08,01also, Unreal was 90s
<Saturn> 08,01and so was Half-Life
<oni_link> tbh the_real_pony_1604 , I dont think that H80 is gonna fit
<Saturn> 08,01for someone who doesn't play games, i know surprisingly much about them...
<oni_link> I think Im better of with the H60
<oni_link> its an interesting topic
<oni_link> whether you play them or not
<Saturn> 08,01i think Perfect Dark was just teetering on being 90s
<oni_link> yeah, very late 90s
<JRP2234> the 90's were the golden age of fpsa
<Saturn> 08,01there was also Blood, which was pretty good
<killerpony7733> Saturn I got that game on GOG
<Saturn> 08,01and, heh, of course, Daikatana
<killerpony7733> Saturn Loved it
<Saturn> 08,01oh shit
<oni_link> Everytime I hear Daikatana I think JonTron XD
<Saturn> 08,01how could i forget System Shock?
<oni_link> and the crappy N64 port
<Saturn> 08,01that was a fucking scary game
<Saturn> 08,01it still terrifies the crap out of me
<the_real_pony_1604> I was originally going to mount one of the fans on the outside. but than discovered it would be difficult with the way it is put together. I managed to cram it all into my antec p90 case but it was very tight
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, taht's about all i can think of right now
<JRP2234> awesome
<JRP2234> how bout the 80s?
<oni_link> I know for a fact the H60 will fit but I don't want to risk not having the H80 not fit you know?
<AdamTheDuck> Yay it runs Phase4 \:3/
<Phase4> : D
<Alma> Nothing is scarier than a water level ... in any game
<oni_link> I hate water levels
<Alma> And all of these jump n run games had a water level
<oni_link> I always have
<Alma> Ocarina of Time, Banjo Kazooie, Super Mario 64...
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<Alma> ALWAYS
*oni_link shivers
<JRP2234> oot was agreat game
<oni_link> Water Temple in OOT and MM were a bitch
<oni_link> especially if you messed up the key order
<Alma> Even Half-Life had Underwater parts
<JRP2234> Saturn How about the 80's?
<killerpony7733> Alma Most games of said time had that.
<Ponies47> Gotta go. School. Bye guys
<oni_link> I wanna hear some C64 history :3
<oni_link> bye Ponies47
<DerpyMuffins> Bye Ponies47
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Ponies47 ~
<Gold_Demona> Oh wow, C64 :D
<AdamTheDuck> Wait, what is the latest version Phase4?
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, 0.18.1
<AdamTheDuck> Ok good
<the_real_pony_1604> understandable, oni_link. what CPU are you using and do you plan any over clock?
<AdamTheDuck> Now to hit the hay
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight everyone.
<the_real_pony_1604> later on
<Alma> oni_link: Man, Valve is specifically creating their games to run on the shittiest systems
<Alma> How else could you achieve 33 million players with a Moba
<oni_link> the_real_pony_1604: I want to eventually start overclocking and im getting an i5-2500K @3.30GHz
<oni_link> Alma: yeah but my menu lags like crazy. and my machine is from 08...
<oni_link> old processor
<the_real_pony_1604> you should be fine with that 60
<oni_link> I thought so , thanks for the help :)
<the_real_pony_1604> and good call getting a sandy bridge. cheaper and I don't know if intel has fixed the ivy bridge heating problems or not
<oni_link> Yeah, I'd rather work with something I know works than to hope it will
<the_real_pony_1604> thats why I got the 3930k when I built my computer a couple months back vs. waiting for the ivy bridge-e to come out. the heating problems with the ivy bridge cpus freaked me out a bit
<Saturn> 08,01JRP2234: there weren't really any in the 80s
<Saturn> 08,01maybe you could count Elite
<JRP2234> 2d games?
<Saturn> 08,01though that was more a space shooter
<the_real_pony_1604> contra
<the_real_pony_1604> but it was a side slider
<Saturn> 08,01hmm
<Saturn> 08,01work on this coursework presentation, or continue designing a CPU?
<Saturn> 08,01the CPU is a hobby project, not coursework
*Saturn 08,01is teaching himself Verilog
<Barbetos> refer to the slackers manual.
<Barbetos> oh. it was never writen.
<Saturn> 08,01well, technically, designing a processor is more work
<Saturn> 08,01but it's not work i *need* to do
<the_real_pony_1604> design a CPU that can be bought for 50 bucks, is naturally 3ghz, can be over clocked to 5, and is 8 core.
<Gasoline> What he playing?
<Saturn> 08,01so it's more attractive
<Saturn> 08,01the_real_pony_1604: easy, but it won't have an x86 instruction set
<the_real_pony_1604> hahah
<the_real_pony_1604> do we really need that any more?
<the_real_pony_1604> ;)
<Saturn> 08,01well, technically, i can just make it add and compare
<Prick> guess whos back, back again!
<Saturn> 08,01it'sll sitll be turing complete, and will fulfil all your requirements stated above
<Prick> I AM ALIVE!
<Saturn> 08,01it'll just be fucking useless
<Saturn> 08,01because of how slow it'd be
<Prick> did ja know Saturn is my favorite planet
<Saturn> 08,01woo! \o/
<Saturn> 08,01i'm my favourite planet too
<Gasoline> I guessed ;)
<Prick> been long time...kinda missed the bstate

<JRP2234> how does this work
<Phase4> JRP2234, telstra
<Saturn> 08,01$15 per MB?
<Saturn> 08,01fuck
<JRP2234> but its a 15 gb plan
<JRP2234> how does this work
<Phase4> Saturn, thats telstra for you
<Phase4> i had an 'unilimited' plan with them which magically became 20GB
<Alchemist> dont...die...on...me! http://derpy.me/cpPRh
<Phase4> and i managed to pull 40GB through a connection that should have slowed to dialup speeds at 20
<Phase4> without noticing
<JRP2234> im begging my mum to use someone better
<Phase4> telstra tried to charge us $3K
<JRP2234> did you pay?
<Phase4> nope
<JRP2234> did you file a lawsuit?
<Phase4> nope
<JRP2234> did you throw bananas at them
<Phase4> that wouldnt have helped much but now i wish i did
<Phase4> JRP2234, notice the drop down box that says hsdpa, try change that
<JRP2234> its not my thigy
<JRP2234> its another persons problem
<Phase4> Saturn, other services vary in quality, betwene 20c and $5 per MB of excess usage
<Phase4> $15 is unique to telstra
<JRP2234> but 15
<Phase4> no one else is that stupid
<JRP2234> wtf
<Phase4> JRP2234, just cancle the service and refuse to pay
<Phase4> they don't deserve any money
<Phase4> shit company, shit staff, shit suport, shit connections and they charge everyone through the nose for bandwidth
<JRP2234> trhats it
<JRP2234> im getting ma own internet
<Phase4> this made sense when they had a monopoly on internet access
<JRP2234> telstra own most of the lines
<CountDoofus> This I'm gonna play some ACIII MP on the XBox. Or MW3.
<CountDoofus> Think*

<AssaultWithEmbraces> SirGanjalf: Older engines from classic cars, I presume?
<BladedWings> Wrek: now i can never see it the same :P
<Sugar_Flanks> Why did the other robots' heads look like Optimus Prime?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I don't see it.

<Dark92Enigma> MORE KICKASS
<Deacon> Zeus I'm in the same boat as you man ;_;
<Fl00t4sh41> Vordox: About a googolplex's worth
<Kandarihu> Vordox, it's built on pop culture references.
<Vordox> Fl00t4sh41: .... Damn. :P
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Err Galaxy Express isn't Pop Culture...
<Vordox> Ever
<Zeus> Deacon: dis global warming
<Sugar_Flanks> dat episode title
<Imadolphin> Oh...
<Kandarihu> Vordox, it is to a lot of anime fans.
<Deacon> not the chrome!
<Vordox> Kandarihu: i think it's more that the creators was fans of the old stuff themselves. :p
<Imadolphin> O____O
<JRP2234> fucking noob tube
<JRP2234> i ahte them
<Imadolphin> SMACH DOWNNN OH SEIT
<Kandarihu> Vordox, Galaxy Express 999 and Captain Harlock were what Leiji Matsumoto's career were built off of. And it IS iconic in Japan.
<Imadolphin> Mazinger Z
<Vordox> Kandarihu: And this show is made in Japan? :P
<Fl00t4sh41> nope, as american as slavery and neocons Vordox
<Vordox> :p
<Fl00t4sh41> Snow wookies?
<Kandarihu> Fl00t4sh41, please no
<Kandarihu> Vordox, no, but obviously the makers of this show were into western otaku culture.
<Vordox> Kencolt: <--- Dat design reminds me of the Beast Kin from FF10.
<LadyCanary> -3-
<Imadolphin> Mega tron
<Meanwhile> Megatron?
<Sugar_Flanks> Apparently Coop's voice actor is Dom DeLuise's son
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Western Otaku? USA has otakus? :P
<VenHur> Megatron?
<Dark92Enigma> MEGATRON!?
<Zeus> id say hes more of a starscream
<Fl00t4sh41> Vordox: They're called Weaboos over here, but yes
<Kandarihu> Vordox, it's generally what Americans who are into anime call ourselves.
<Dark_Horst> isnt it moe of a moon?
<Zeus> nice
<Sugar_Flanks> Not even a brain freeze
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Clearly fans. :D But that's just great. Happy to see references becoming new references
<LadyCanary> Well would you look at that! You're right Sugar_Flanks!
<jcelios> Word of the Day: Cereology - The study of Crop Circles.
<Zeus> there's a Halo episod of this too right?
<Deacon> iirc, I think
<Dark_Horst> oh look, upside down galaxies
<Sugar_Flanks> Decepticons beeyatch!!!
<Flumori> hi Afflict
<Kandarihu> Zeus, there's an episode that takes place on an artificial ring-world of sorts. But it's not a weapon, just a library.
<JRP2234> yes
<jcelios> piss on it
<JRP2234> the halo was a library
<Zeus> Kandarihu: still nerdgasmed when i saw it
<Sugar_Flanks> Where's the WD40 when you need it?
<Dark_Horst> wd40 is oil
<Fl00t4sh41> Kandarihu: That ones a Ringworld reference I think
<Fl00t4sh41> And aliens
<Kandarihu> Fl00t4sh41, I see. Okay.
<SirGanjalf> welp
<Fl00t4sh41> and a few other sci fi stories
<Imadolphin> sheeeitttt
<Deacon> and not a single drop of blood
<SirGanjalf> PAWNC?H!
<Imadolphin> LOL
<Fl00t4sh41> Kandarihu: Halo basically stole most of their universe from ringworld
<Vordox> ......
<Meanwhile> Your instinct sucks.
<SirGanjalf> Button apply directly to the forehead
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> sup
<Vordox> Dat City Quota
<XaviortheSavior> You're doing it wrong!
<Serenity> Well done Coop. You did a thing
<Fl00t4sh41> only in ringworld, the ringworld is a bit bigger
<Sugar_Flanks> Dominos!!
<Imadolphin> Dawn
<Dark_Horst> of course he'd fuck it up
<jcelios> Fl00t4sh41: bunch of Halo lore is an extension from Marathon also
<Zeus> Fl00t4sh41: NO Halo is original all the way
<Flumori> about to try playing skylanders giants in a bit
<Deacon> city destroyed quota fulfilled
<Fl00t4sh41> has around 300.000.000 times that of earth
<Sugar_Flanks> Why does the robot have teeth?
<Wrek> 05halo would have the same lore as marathon
<Wrek> 05had it not been for "oh new IP"
<Wrek> 05but its ehaviyl absed of it
<Imadolphin> Wut
<Wrek> 05and i cant wait for the new marathon game they announced
<Fl00t4sh41> Zeus: Even the ancients who where wiped out but who happen to be the ancestors of humanity?
<jcelios> no Durandel = sad pony :(
<Vordox> Wrek: English please?
<Fl00t4sh41> And the rings
<Fl00t4sh41> and all the other bits
<VenHur> Wrek: English motherfucker, do you speak it?!
<Imadolphin> >_>

<Meanwhile> Saved! Doomed! Make your mind up.
<Afflict> hey
<Imadolphin> Doomed
<Dark92Enigma> brb guys
<Zeus> Fl00t4sh41: i was kiddin but I dont know what marathon is though
<jcelios> Wrek: you are like the only other Marathon fan I've ever met :)
<Fl00t4sh41> Meanwhile: It's basically the same thing, right?
<Meanwhile> Fl00t4sh41: Eh? What?
<Sugar_Flanks> Robot teeth
<Fl00t4sh41> Sugar_Flanks: Robots got to chew their food too
<Serenity> Yes
<ThunderBlaze> oh my god this show!

<ThunderBlaze> Deacon: Sup
<Zeus> hey ThunderBlaze
<alexxm|colt> soundwave
<Fl00t4sh41> Why don't the robots just grab a section of empty wilderness instead of the one place theres locals who will fight back?
<alexxm|colt> how are things ThunderBlaze
<ThunderBlaze> Going alright
<Dark_Horst> Fl00t4sh41: cuz they evil
<Kandarihu> Fl00t4sh41, because they're not fighting over empty wilderness.
<jcelios> Fl00t4sh41: they want the whole planet eventually, so they need to fight them
<ThunderBlaze> I was going to play L4d 2 but i wanted to join this for a while
<Meanwhile> Kewp.
<SirGanjalf> Fl00t4sh41: That's how colonialism works
<Fl00t4sh41> Just seems like its needlessly provokative towards the locals
<Zeus> well they are evil
<ThunderBlaze> Zeus: RAGGH WERE EVIL!
<Zeus> lolcats
<SirGanjalf> Find new land > Slay the locals > Take the land > Repeat
<Imadolphin> Home RUN!!
<Vordox> SirGanjalf: oh look, humans
<Zeus> ThunderBlaze: suddenly mermaid man comes to mnd
<Flumori> They make it almost impossible to take out everything without destroying the packaging :/
<Fl00t4sh41> Just seems like a massively ineffecient way to get water for the supposedly logical AI's in the robots
<ThunderBlaze> Zeus: EVIIIIIILLLLLLL
<Dark92Enigma> back

<Dark_Horst> goddammit, coop
<Dark92Enigma> Zeus: that's the full name

<Dark_Horst> melt errything
<Dark92Enigma> Zeus: looked it up, not on youtube anymore
<Fl00t4sh41> Only had to doom the entire local biosphere to do it
<Fl00t4sh41> Kandarihu: Right

<Kandarihu> Some time before my first cat adopted me, I took care of a friend's two pet Iguanas. They were nice to see.
<Fl00t4sh41> Bronysith: Is it really ethically sound to keep a sentient being as a pet?

*AssaultWithEmbraces slaps SirGanjalf
<Kandarihu> ...or in a fight with other cats.
<Zeus> artist: that just means your good person
<Deacon> poor kitties
<Dark_Horst> Kandarihu: the solution for that would be simply to not dress your cat up and put it in a cage in a great hall
<artist> Zeus: im not a good person either,,,,

<AssaultWithEmbraces> "One sentence that describes you"
<Alchemist> pie
<BladedWings> not enough lol
<jcelios> AssaultWithEmbraces: I'm so awesome.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I don't know what I would write.
<Deacon> Hoping? from a scientist? XD
<Hoody|Skool> write 666
<Vordox> AssaultWithEmbraces: Vordox: Paradoxial Vortex.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Besides "I think I'm annoying"
<Vordox> ...
<jcelios> AssaultWithEmbraces: I think the concept is entirely bs so I wouldn't care what I wrote XD
<Alchemist> Deacon: come on, we have hope too :(
*Vordox hugs AssaultWithEmbraces.
<artist> im bach
<YokusaHHart> ...
*AssaultWithEmbraces hugs Vordox "It's true, I do think that sometimes"
<Dark_Horst> Deacon: thrwing things at walls and hoping they stick is the very essence of science
<Vordox> Everyone is annoying :P
<Vordox> One way or another
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: really?
<BladedWings> AssaultWithEmbraces: you is not annoying *huggle*
<Deacon> maybe he did some background checks
<artist> Dark_Horst: isnt that madness?
<Dark_Horst> Alchemist: sure. why you think they call it experimenting?
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: you think its completely random?
<Deacon> he's Cirno incarnate
<Dark_Horst> a scientist has no idea what he's doing. he does something, sees what happens and treis to find a way to relate that somehting to the next thing he does
<Dark_Horst> that's how theories are made and tested
<Chrysalis> dat is a nice rollercoaster
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: I thought it was to refute until proven to be false
<CountDoofus> "Who's the chick with the long shadow?" :D MY SIDES :D
<YokusaHHart> so...much...bull....
<artist> BS! everything is BS
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: science never refutes. it questions
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: I research the self assembly properties of polyelectrolites and surfactants on silica surfaces with an ellipsometer and atomic force microscope.
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: That heh. :P
<Dark_Horst> the refuting part may only occur AFTER something is proven wrong
<AssaultWithEmbraces> The only Gemini's I know are my two friends, who were born about a month apart.
<artist> Alchemist: wut?
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Oh derp
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: We'd like to see if we can form a double layer of polymers on a surface.
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Hmm
<Meanwhile> My sister is a Gemini.
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: I guess refute means somehing else. :D
<Dark_Horst> Alchemist: that's pretty far in the "see what sticks"-process
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: our method is calculated and in no way random.
<Dark_Horst> Alchemist: you already got something that stuck
<Deacon> aha!
<Meanwhile> rofl.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> That's because he's giving off creep vibes.
<Meanwhile> Dat precaution.
<Dark_Horst> Alchemist: sure, but were methods that clear when nobody knew what a polymer is?
<Vordox> PHD = So what?

*Hoody|Skool glomps artist
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I'd rather not share my personality in front of a room of people.
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: sure, but its more than bangin rocks together what you are basically saying.
<Deacon> ha, he skipped her
<Dark92Enigma> my test was average
<Dark_Horst> Alchemist: it's more like highly sophisticated rocks
<Vordox> Broadened
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: forget it, you are just going to make me mad.

<Shizuka> 13Hoody|Skool: well, they knew the regulars were coming
<Vordox> A promise?
<Shizuka> 13it wasn't "one if by land two if by sea" cause they knew they were coming over sea

<Bronysith> Vordox: 65%
<goop> What? What did the danes do?

<Vordox> What's happening over there, Denmark?
<Fl00t4sh41> Vordox: Danish tax isn't as bad as they portray it as
<Dark_Horst> scientology has an own secret service that wages war against anyone who says somethign he shouldnt say
<Shizuka> 13progressive tax, where the top 1% of the country pays over 40% of all taxes

<Vordox> Shizuka: Sounds fair?
<Wrek> 05its not äppelpaaaaaj~ so im not interested
<Vordox> XD Wrek
<Shizuka> 13part of this show's aesthetic comes from the base premise: if they were to say "so and so is a LIAR" they'd get sued for defamation

<Deacon> lali-ho Lil_B
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Lil_B :)
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi Lil_B
<alexxm|colt> how are things Lil_B
<Kandarihu> Dark_Horst, well the mainstream media has been doing everything they can to flag the Tea Party as a hate group and a terrorist organization. Resorting to violence to any degree will give them plenty of leverage to substantiate those claims.
<artist> Candle Cove Experiences :: Tales of the Laughingstock"
<artist> that one
<Lil_B> soo muchh...
<Shizuka> 13that means for the millions of people that would like this government to gtfo back to the limited powers it was meant to have, there are millions more who are dependent on that very government
<Ryunosuke> oh sweet here we go
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Which is the idea. Easier to control you if they get you dependent on them.
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Vordox> Shizuka: Strongest/Fittest but arounda a system? :P
*Lil_B hugs BladedWings Vordox AdamTheDuck Deacon MLP_Brovakiin AssaultWithEmbraces alexxm|colt ;)

<DerpyWhooves> ^
<Vordox> goop: Where are you reading this? on bronystate or the irc?
<Meanwhile> Right click the name and then query, or double click the name. That tends to work.
<CriticKitten> ....wat
<goop> bronystate
<Lil_B> DerpyWhooves I usually just hug when I leave to the people who said goodbye, so actually, it only happens once or twice a day, and that, here, isn't much in terms of hugging :3
<Shizuka> 13STOP idiot politician
<Shizuka> 13yes the sales tax option would be around 20%
<Shizuka> 13BUT THAT WOULD BE WITH THE ABSENCE OF ALL OTHER TAXES
<Vordox> goop: Then after that, --> Names on right, find the one you want to PM and double click
<CriticKitten> Why would you need a sales tax if you install a flat income tax? That's fucking ridiculous
<Shizuka> 13CriticKitten: it's all misdirection
<CriticKitten> Try spending less money, for fuck's sake. :|
<Shizuka> 13they like to say "OMFG NO NATIONAL SALES TAX" because they want people to believe that would be on top of what we have now
<Shizuka> 13when it would REPLACE what we have
<Vordox> <--- SOLVE YOUR OWN PROBLEMS?
<Vordox> USA?
*Lil_B also swipes AdamTheDuck s Saliva off his Face xD
<Vordox> HAHAHAHA
<Vordox> no
<YokusaHHart> 'MUUURUCA!
<Deacon> how do you even define "unamerican"?
<Bronysith> Vordox: we are idiots over here
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Yeah, a lot of politics nowadays is misdirection sadly
<artist> TEY TOOK UR JOOOOOBS
<Deacon> actually, nvm
<Shizuka> 13"When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic."
<BladedWings> DEEERP A DEEEEER
<AdamTheDuck> I like these guys with funny hats :3
<Vordox> Shizuka: But I thought your system of tax got created about....
<YokusaHHart> because America is the onlyy nation that can solve it's own problems
<Vordox> Since the beginning?
<Deacon> AdamTheDuck indeed :)
<Shizuka> 13oh no
<Ryunosuke> on a side note: one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter
<Meanwhile> And exactly when does anything come of this storm of gibberish?
<CriticKitten> It's an outright lie that we'd need a huge sales tax to compensate, if we couple that tax with (gasp) reduced spending.
*AdamTheDuck wants a hat like theirs too :$
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: basically, replace your taxes with more taxes?
<Shizuka> 13Dark92Enigma: not more
<Shizuka> 13different
<Lil_B> Meanwhile mostly... Sadness for those who ask themselfes this question
<Vordox> Shizuka: So..."how" different?
<Dark92Enigma> Deacon: easy: FLIP THE USA FLAG UPSIDE DOWN
<Shizuka> 13as is you're taxed whether you use the service the tax pays for or not
<Ryunosuke> WOAH
<Alchemist> ohai
<artist> bush
<DerpyWhooves> Why are taxes being discussed on Bronystate?

<Kandarihu> Dangit
<YokusaHHart> oh hai naked lady
<Ryunosuke> I need an adult
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Okay guys, grow up.
<Shizuka> 13on top of that you're actively discouraged from becoming successful because of progressive taxation
<Ryunosuke> nice hat?
<Shizuka> 13national sales tax would replace all current taxes with one flat rate on sales
<Vordox> Shizuka: So how about a fully dynamic system for economy balance?
<BladedWings> i want that cool hat ^_^
<Shizuka> 13hahahahahahahahhahahaha
<XxNightHawk64xX> ..... this is the best ta documentary EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111
<Lil_B> well... let's say this is just good Body Paint

<Ryunosuke> oh dear, shes naked
<Dark92Enigma> DerpyWhooves: because Penn & Teller are talking about them
<Nittany_Discord> Is Wrek streaming more rage-inducing crap?

<Ryunosuke> LadyCanary: tongue back in your mouth :p
<Bronysith> oh hey, naked dudes
<Ryunosuke> IK IK
<LadyCanary> You'd better not be serious artist
<Fl00t4sh41> Shizuka: Wouldn't that just place the tax burden on those on have the least money to pay tax?
<Kandarihu> artist, I consider them messed up people, but they are still people.
<Shizuka> 13Fl00t4sh41: it forces them to have money in the game
<artist> LadyCanary: ofcourse i am!
<Lil_B> He's getting juggy
<LadyCanary> Hm, Ryunosuke?
<Lil_B> jiggy*
<Ryunosuke> nothing ;)
<Shizuka> 13if they want the servies, they'd better damn well help pay for them
<Fl00t4sh41> Shizuka: And be far insuficient to pay for all the goverments expencies?
<Fl00t4sh41> Shizuka: So, "screw the poor" then?
<Anger> MURICA
<Vordox> Shizuka: As stated, fully dynamical economy balance
<XxNightHawk64xX> wait now i know who those guys are there from that magic show thingy they judge magic act right

<Vordox> XxNightHawk64xX: yes
<Ryunosuke> there was a saying i read a few weeks ago
<Shizuka> 13that tells them they can demand more
<Deacon> XxNightHawk64xX ya, penn and teller are magicians yes
<CriticKitten> Shizu: And wasn't that the idea behind Cain's flat tax? To replace the tax code with a flat, easily understood tax system?
<LadyCanary> OMG
<Meanwhile> Play the one about the Vatican, it'd be more entertaining.
<XxNightHawk64xX> thats who they are oen and teller

<YokusaHHart> oh yeah!
<Ryunosuke> "we arent asking people with money to pay more to be dicks and assholes, we are asking them to pay more because they have the resources to do so"
<Shizuka> 13is that fair?
<BladedWings> from boobs and naked people to KND, nice transition Wrek :D
<XxNightHawk64xX> OMFG THIS SHOW WAS MY FUCKING CHILDHOOD HOHOHOHO SHIT

<Kipkat07_Scarf> but each mod is best mod
<jcelios> Angry Birds
<twilight_sprinkle> theres even a browser version of quake
<Chrysalis> jcelios thats not a real game
<Vordox> Chrysalis: Spy vs Spy vs n multiplayer
<Kipkat07_Scarf> How are computers like air conditioners?
<twilight_sprinkle> and by browser version i mean its the actual game, just in a browser
<MLP_Brovakiin> Someone snuck Quake onto the school network and it is all everyone plays :p

<Stormy> I want to have a bonfire now

<Prince_Lightstar> Michael: i come u leave seems suspicuis

<Barbetos|PonyMan> AssaultWithEmbraces: No. I am not that witty. XD
<Prince_Lightstar> i have new headphones
<Prince_Lightstar> :D
<Barbetos|PonyMan> I just watch the pony. =|
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Barbetos|PonyMan: Okay. I feel sorry for the person doing the explaining
<Barbetos|PonyMan> They tell me too.
<Kandarihu> Well, the next episode is the second (and hopefully last) episode this season that I can't watch with you. I'll be in a hotel with crummy internet, and I doubt that the TV service even gets The HUB.
<Prince_Lightstar> new pics
<Polydunami> Sorry to hear about that, Kandarihu :(
*Bronysith takes Kandarihu to his house and bed to watch the new episode
<Prince_Lightstar> tom and jerry is on mai tv :D
*Socks only saw the S3 prem on bronystate and then couldn't use chat :'(
<thelonepony> Socks: I know that feel
<Prince_Lightstar> dang it it went off .-.
<Kjakings> 7Based on the title, I think not.

<AssaultWithEmbraces> Kandarihu: Thanks for reminding me that I won't be able to watch the new episode as well.
<Socks> Linkstorm O.O
<twilight_sprinkle> jcelios: ah, youre studying electromagnetics?
<Kandarihu> It's okay. I'll just look forward to watching the episode when I get back. I wouldn't want to do anything piracy related on my relatives' internet connection. They have a home business, and don't want to get in trouble for anything.
<jcelios> twilight_sprinkle: Physics in general

<twilight_sprinkle> and hai soulrider95
<Vordox> What happened to Scoot?
<Flumori> was worth a try anyway...
<twilight_sprinkle> np jcelios
<Flumori> and Stormy! stay away from the evil poni fans like SR >.>
<Stormy> but but... then I'd have to stay away from myself
<Stormy> D:

<thelonepony> completly sprunkls
<Flumori> :(
<Stormy> it only took a couple days to develop holes
<Stormy> it was just cheaply made I guess
<Polydunami> Finished the penultimate season of LOST last night
<thelonepony> http://i.imgur.com/8LPTi.jpg
<Polydunami> One more to go
<thelonepony> :O
<Stormy> I learned that buying merchandise from the state fair is not a good idea
<jcelios> get ready for disappointment
<Polydunami> Me?
<Kjakings> 7...
<jcelios> yeah :$
<Kjakings> 7How did it develope holes stormy?
<Stormy> No freaking clue
<Polydunami> I sort of have an idea of what's going to happen.
<Kjakings> 7It just seems very suspect.
<Polydunami> Kind of spoiled myself on that part :$
<Flumori> >.>
<soulrider95> can someone ping me? I think I got this set up...
<Polydunami> soulrider95
<thelonepony> brb, gonna make myself a Chicken sanvich
<Flumori> remember this is a family chat room :)
<soulrider95> Awesome it works :D
<Stormy> I just hung it from the ceiling in my room and the next thing I knew it was half deflated
<Flumori> you cant patch it?
<Stormy> I tried, but it was impossible to find all the holes
<soulrider95> I have it set to do the Na'Vi "Hey, Listen!
<soulrider95> when I am pinged >:D

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> [12:50:09] Brett_ (TTerbo@668E9764.53B02C66.1ECCA1CC.IP) joined the channel.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> [12:50:09] Fluttershy sets mode +v Brett_
<Stormy> oh no, someone made a reference to something I don't like
<Stormy> My life is ruined
<twilight_sprinkle> what issue?
<Polydunami> I'm wondering more of what Pinkie is.
<Bronysith> Sparky: you mean how they are awesome?
<Sparky> weather they shall be featured and yes :3
<Flumori> ?
<Flumori> I don't understand
<alexxm> so when should the newsletter be out
<twilight_sprinkle> soon i suspect
<Polydunami> I'm skeptical of them being featured this season. That's all I can say.
<twilight_sprinkle> survey closes on thursday, has to be out soon
<Stormy> Sarcasm
<Sparky> Polydunami i agree, i look at new species by the greed of hasbro and they already have crystal ponies to sell
<jcelios> why is burning stuff so much fun?
<Flumori> I always seem to miss that
<Polydunami> http://forgotten-wings.deviantart.com/art/Fluttershy-343299013 Should I d'awww?
<Stormy> it can be hard to catch on the internet
<Bronysith> no
<twilight_sprinkle> well it has fluttershy, so no probably
<Neotyguy40> Really?
<Sparky> jcelios bc you are an attention attractor with a hoodie filled with spaghetti
<Neotyguy40> I didn't notice
<Polydunami> I still think it's a cute picture
<Neotyguy40> 8-)
<Stormy> I see what you did there :O
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: why do all the bronies love fluttershy?
<Polydunami> Also, resolution :O
<Sparky> evil fluttershy is still cute
<thelonepony> !cd
<Tom> Episode 8 of season 3 "Apple Family Reunion" airs in 3 days, 17 hours, 10 minutes, 1 seconds (Dec 22 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<Polydunami> Fluttershy isn't my favourite
<Neotyguy40> I didn't
<thelonepony> ah
<Neotyguy40> 8-)
<Flumori> Is fluttersky supposed to be a MLP reference?
<Sparky> im a dashie and luna fan
<Polydunami> But I still think she's a cute pony
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: heck if i know, prolly cause shy, altho everyone forgets how mean she can be
<jcelios> Sparky: wat
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: shes shy and cute, thats it
<Neotyguy40> No
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: even though she is a selfish bitch
<Neotyguy40> My name is Original the Character
<Sparky> Bronysith and thats cute
<Flumori> eh?
<Sparky> Bronysith also the yay thing
<Bronysith> she is just so meh
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: true, her kindness extends mostly to critters
<Stormy> this be Fluttershy https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Zx4eHRFSXQs/TrhaZlNFToI/AAAAAAAADGE/9hKYWO4WP3E/s493/you__re_going_to_love_me_by_envidia14-d3frmm8.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> hard to convince her to help other ponies
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: she also demonstrated her selfshiness in the trixie episode
<Polydunami> http://snow360.deviantart.com/art/Pinkie-Wall-Wallpaper-343376653 Candied glass?
<Flumori> I see..
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/JdCkv.gif this is a fluttershy.
<Flumori> bleh, ponies as usual..
<Sparky> Polydunami dat tounge lol jk
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> well duh.
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: exactly, element of kindness- if you hurt my pets on accident, ill hrt you to fix it
<Flumori> http://darkspyro.net/news/68176/
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: thats somewhat frightening
<Flumori> time to add some spyro news to this place
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> darkspyro? blasphemy!
<Flumori> :D
<Stormy> hey, I was going to say that
<Stormy> :<
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: my friend exiled from ponyville? my home being taken over by an evil corrupt bitch? "I WANNA GO HOME AND BE IN MY BED"
<Polydunami> Oh, it's "tongue" by the way
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> bannable offence.
<Polydunami> Common mistake :P
<Sparky> i cant spell
<Flumori> ...
<Sparky> so do ponies have religion?
<Bronysith> Fluttershy is such an unlikeable bitch
<Neotyguy40> DEAR GOD
<Flumori> I dont think any of us have been following the rules
<jcelios> :'(
<Kjakings> 7... Can we just go back to the fact that Stormy had trouble filling all the inflatable's holes?
<Neotyguy40> MY EYES
<Stormy> I don't think I can ban the channel owner, sorry SR :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> there are no rules.
<Bronysith> but she does those little "squees" or "yays" and the whole fandom loves her
<Bronysith> bullshit
<Flumori> exactly
<Sparky> Bronysith but shes soo cute
<Kjakings> 7Except don't talk about spyrochat.
<jcelios> :'(
<Flumori> so don't give me this blasphemy stuff
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I dont have owner or anything because the network is messed up.
<Kjakings> 7That is the first rule of spyrochat
<Bronysith> Sparky: hitler was cute once
<Stormy> Kjakings, seriously, you're the only one who thinks of perverted references whenever someone mentions the word hole
<Flumori> You really want to ban me SR?
<twilight_sprinkle> meh, i dont find her all that cute, altho cuteness is subjective
<Neotyguy40> Who made this Darkspyro site?
<Neotyguy40> It is horrendous
<Stormy> Flumori, it's sarcasm again :P
<Sparky> Bronysith i dont think fluttershy could be a hitler
<Flumori> ...
<Wrek> 05hey atleast hitler killed hitler
<Wrek> 05right?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I would have to ssh into charizard and I forget the password
<Wrek> 05anyways
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and username.
<Wrek> 05sleep
<Neotyguy40> It's like Purple meets 1998
<Bronysith> Wrek: hitler killed the guy who killed hitler
<Kjakings> 7Stormy: hey I'm just saying you're layering it on thicker and thicker.
<Sparky> @Wrek good point
<Stormy> I'm pretty sure you're the only one seeing this
<Sparky> Hitler is best Hitler
<Bronysith> Sparky: she is just cute, thats it
<Stormy> but whatever
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont hate her though, i dont hate anypony, altho i do think shes the least nice and very overrated
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> then add myself to opers
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> because the oper list was wiped.
<Polydunami> That's not a sound argument, anyway. Hitler has nothing to do with Fluttershy.
<Neotyguy40> Am I the only one in a rage at the moment?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yep.
<Sparky> yep
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: she, rainbow dash, and pinkie pie are most overrated
<Stormy> SR you should still have oper
<Stormy> There's no way I still would if you didn't
<Flumori> SR if it pisses you off that much then maybe my time is almost up here..
<Stormy> we were oper'd at the same time
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Flumori what are you talking about?
<Sparky> Bronysith but dashie is best mane six pony (in my opinion)
<Flumori> Your acting like you wanna kick me out of this place
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: rarity needs some love
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Maybe you should calm your ass down and relax.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: and of course applejack gets nothing
<Stormy> it's just a joke, no one wants to kick anyone out
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> No one was serious about anything.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> have I ever been serious about anything?
<Amu-chan> Eh... You're kinda overreacting Flumori...
<Sparky> aj is best backround pony
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: well the next ep seems to be an AJ one, that might change things
<Flumori> I am calm, cant exactly get mad while sick :/
<twilight_sprinkle> at least judging from the title
<Sparky> there have been alot of dash eps this season
<Neotyguy40> I want to kick something
<Bronysith> yea
<Bronysith> 2 in a row
<Neotyguy40> Preferably something kickable
<twilight_sprinkle> no rarity eps so far
<Stormy> why? o.o
<Neotyguy40> Like a kickball
<Sparky> well rarity was in the week before last
<Neotyguy40> Or a soccerball
<Sparky> and t was more a scootaloo ep
<Neotyguy40> Or Honey Booboo
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: well TBF applejack got her own episodes...but no one payed attention to her, only derpy and the flim flam brothers
<Bronysith> brb
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy I think I forget my oper login too.
<Sparky> flim flam were pretty damn noticable
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> if its still there I cant remember it.
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: yeah but i dont think thats the writers fault that people cant get over 20 seconds of derpy to shift their attention back to aj
<Sparky> true
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Ill keep trying passwords.
<Sparky> i just dont know what went wrong
<twilight_sprinkle> lul
<thelonepony> Lul indeed
<thelonepony> sprunkls
<Sparky> xD
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I thought aristeo killed the oper list
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and didnt restore it
<Sparky> this season needs a really good, winter wrap up level song
<Stormy> why would he do that?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> upgrades?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> can you oper?
<Stormy> yes
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> weird
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I probably just forget my password.
<thelonepony> Sparky: that would problaly happen some where near the end of the Season
<Stormy> maybe I could change it?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Meghan McCarthy's New Episode Tease
<twilight_sprinkle> i wonder if we'll get a christmas ep
<Sparky> thelonepony perhaps
<Stormy> I don't know if that's something I am allowed to do
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> i dont think it would let you
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: we had one, have you notice the seasons changing in the background?
<Sparky> speak of the devil read that post
<thelonepony> During season 3 i mean
<Sparky> yeah
<Amu-chan> I think only the network owner can do that.
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: well i meant christmas ep as in dedicated to christmas
<Polydunami> daribot spoiler
<Flumori> whos the network owner?
<thelonepony> a teaser huh?
<Stormy> Aristeo
<Polydunami> Also, http://steffy-beff.deviantart.com/art/Twilight-Stocking-Stuffer-343453781
<Sparky> still i think we should get a hannukah ep lol im not jewish it would be funny tho
<Stormy> He's never here anymore though
<thelonepony> well, gonna avoid that for now
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I dont really care too much
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: i know
<Sparky> Polydunami awww :)
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i just realized, only twilight and pinkie pie have stayed loyal to their elements
<Polydunami> Best pony, huh?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> aristeo is on my gtalk.
<Polydunami> Party of One
<Bronysith> never said that
<Sparky> im gunna head out
<Vordox> http://derpy.me/YUviy
<Sparky> peace pplz :D
<Stormy> yeah, I don't think he's ever online though
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: true, but i suppose flaws are only natural
<Stormy> idle if anything
<twilight_sprinkle> well yeah there is party of one
<Sparky> BAI
<twilight_sprinkle> oh, bye Sparky :P
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: yea, but even then twilight forgets shes a unicorn at some points XD
<Stormy> I could send him a facebook message? :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: well the writing was never as brilliant as people say it is
<Polydunami> Better than what it used to be
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: whatever, the show is still enjoyable, but what it lacks is CONSISTENCY
<twilight_sprinkle> i even feel a bit sorry for the writers, seems to me that theyre a bit out of league with the expectations
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: they also being forced to take ideas from bronies
<Bronysith> goddamnit who ever is in charge
<Vordox> http://derpy.me/J3uV8
<thelonepony> Bronysith: Really? wow
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: well, im just in it for the cute ponies with likeable and often relatable characters :P
<twilight_sprinkle> so as long as it has that, ill probably like it
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: yup, cause tehre are good episodes, but its been taking a steady downfall since after the season 2 premiere
<twilight_sprinkle> that and the dynamic and very lively style it has
<Polydunami> Nest of Twilight :3
<Pwny> Hi everypony
<Polydunami> Hey there, Pwny
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai Pwny
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Pwny
<thelonepony> Hi Pwny
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: and of course, the animation, is wonderfully beautiful
<Vordox> For Rainbow Dash fans instead
<Vordox> ttp://derpy.me/DjSLt
<Polydunami> Whoops
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: yeah, the animation is a big part of the dynamic and lively style
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i just feel since lauren left it has gone downhill
<Vordox> For EVERYONE
<Vordox> http://derpy.me/cYuXf
<Polydunami> I still think Twilight is cuter
<Bronysith> Vordox: yay
<Buytoast> rainbow terrible is the worst horse though
<twilight_sprinkle> woops, i accidentally the tab
<Bronysith> Polydunami: thank you
<Vordox> Any Pinkie PIe fans here?
<Vordox> http://derpy.me/hBeyp
<Polydunami> Just my opinion
<thelonepony> Vordox: the First one didnt work
<Polydunami> SO MUCH RESOLUTION
<thelonepony> you're missing the h in Http
<Stormy> Wonder what was wrong with Neotyguy
<Polydunami> Also, not in this picture
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: and it really does feel like they are trying to make the show more epic...but come on, its ponies, they can have their adventures...but trying to make it lord of the rings? no, just no
<Vordox> For ValTheJean/Caramel, and Prince_Dari
<Vordox> http://derpy.me/-Wdc-
<prince-dari> ?
<Pwny> so i habe a little question is there any dvd box including every episode from season 1 and/or 2 ? cause i am searching for dvd boxes and in germany there are only the boxes with 2 or 3 episodes per dvd -.-
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: yeah and s2 finale felt more like action than ponies
<prince-dari> Hahahaha
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: and teh fight scene with the changelings, was indeed, just fanservice and pointless
<Chrysalis> Vordox why
<Vordox> prince-dari: =3 <3
<Vordox> Chrysalis: Cause Prince_Dari and Caramel
<Vordox> Nuff said
<twilight_sprinkle> Pwny: i think there is, and i think Sumica has a dvd like that
<Vordox> For Fluttershy Fans!
<Vordox> http://derpy.me/aQafC
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: beginning of season 2 "theres a spell on the door only i can break" end of season "go get the elements twilight"
<Chrysalis> but old gen
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: hahahahah
<Chrysalis> we has new ponehs now
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: so even if they made it to where the elements were "yay we did it....how the fuck do we open this?"
<Vordox> Aaand one more for Fluttershy fans!
<Vordox> http://derpy.me/9wLkA
<Polydunami> Again. I still think the Twilight one is cuter.
<Alchemist> I dont know why but this is funny :D http://derpy.me/cpPRh
<Bronysith> and now pizza is here, so i nom on delicious cheese and sauce
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: yeah theres plenty of plot holes in the show, but eh, after all it was oriented for children and i would prefer it stay that way, i dont expect a perfect story from it
<Sumica> 00,10there is such a DVD set yes Pwny, but however it's only in US Canada and Australia IIRC
<Vordox> Okay, let's go all out "d'aaaaaw"
<Vordox> http://derpy.me/tQ0Jm
<Vordox> Well, d'aaw for me :P CMC ftw!

<Sumica> 00,10http://www.amazon.com/My-Little-Pony-Friendship-Magic/dp/B0096W47NO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1354836817&sr=8-1&keywords=friendship+is+magic+season+1
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i know, but people saying the wedding is the best episode....is wrong, the writing wasnt consistent, the characters say things that contradict themselves and overall, most overrated episode of the series
<Polydunami> I'm surprised at Sweetie Belle's pointy horn
<Vordox> Polydunami: http://derpy.me/6so5I You said what?
<twilight_sprinkle> why do people use fanpop, seems like a terrible image-sharing site to me, too much junk around the page which makes it slow and the image frame is small
<Buytoast> funnyjunk is worse
<JRP2234> fuck you and your fucking regional bullshit
<Pwny> ah thx then i have to import them :)
<Bronysith> JRP2234: pay me double the amount and ill mail it to you
<thelonepony> Buytoast: true
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: true, it was mostly hype, although i do maintain that this day aria was the best song
<Vordox> But then we have my favourite pony outside of background Pony AJ <3
<Vordox> http://derpy.me/r2oFs
<Vordox> Forever my fave
<Chrysalis> and STILL no uk releas
<Polydunami> You mean the part where I find Twilight cuter?
<JRP2234> "Region: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only"
<JRP2234> fuck
<JRP2234> you
<twilight_sprinkle> true, funnyjunk doesnt even link to the image, whats up with that
<alexxm> Chrysalis as i understand we haven't had the show air here yet though
<Chrysalis> alexxm nope
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i can see people liking it, but it is kind of insulting to lauren, who made previously established characters, and some of them still dont even have a song when 1 time characters got their own XD
<JRP2234> who invented this idea and why are they allowed to live
<Bronysith> BRB
<Vordox> Polydunami: OR BETTER YET! For our dear Saturn and Chrysalis
<Vordox> http://derpy.me/XuY1R
<Chrysalis> Vordox :O
<Chrysalis> i like
<Polydunami> Well, that's a cute image too
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: hm i dont really see how its insulting to her, more like just not very well thought-through progression

<twilight_sprinkle> yeah, and vanquishing americans and germans with a hammer and sickle :P
<twilight_sprinkle> "for the honey kingdooooom!"
<Vordox> "I told you sis, it's a amazing sight to behold out here." "Well, maybe this once..." http://derpy.me/FRdOR

<Phase4> Sumica, o_O
<Kandarihu> Sharktapus... whatever. I never had any interest in these "Made for Sci-Fi Channel" movies even before they went into network decay.
<oni_link> Phase4: Thats stupid. If its for sale, they should have a display model to try. I hate when stores do that
<Buytoast> there's a lake placid 4?
<Sumica> 00,10seems it has alot of the cast of eurika

<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 wakey wakey
<pony_2534> egggs and breaky
<Kandarihu> I just looked at the System Requirements and it said that I need a GPU with 512 MB of RAM. I have 2XX RAM on mine.

<oni_link> Kandarihu: Im literally in the same boat as you
<Kandarihu> Skyrim

<Gold_Demona> Hiyo MadSurge =)
<Jmo> Imformed.
<MadSurge> And hello Ninjazz :)
<Ninjazz> It's the new spelling of informed.
<Ninjazz> Hey hey Surge.
<Gold_Demona> Informd of what Mojay?
<Gold_Demona> Chat ded? :<
<SuperBrony64> 11,02JRP2234: O3O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Who's streaming? o.o
<SuperBrony64> 11,02ded chat is ded
<Gold_Demona> eyup
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64
<JRP2234> lll
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Fate (Wii U - Q4 2013) :)
<JRP2234> Phase4 wake up
<JRP2234> 3ds?
<Phase4> ?
<JRP2234> wait
<JRP2234> fate
<JRP2234> Whers the fucking mask SuperBrony64
<CrystalPhoenix> SuperBrony64, source
<CrystalPhoenix> cause that sounds like a nasty rumors
<MadSurge> They're gonna make more stuff about Majora?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02CrystalPhoenix: Can't give em, sorry.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Not sure who is streaming O~O but hopefully he doesn't mind me posting this link: http://www.terriblefate.com/
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek has seemed to disconnected
<Ninjazz> And there he goes.
*SuperBrony64 hugs Wrek ^-^
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Wrek
<SuperBrony64> 11,02"You find out the backstory of Majora and the mask he sculpted. You play as Link found trapped in a Hyrule that’s been twisted with fear and hate. You’ll switch roles during the adventure to try and piece together the puzzle of Majora’s Fate before Hyrule reaches total destruction."
<Wrek> 05facking shitfacessdgiokerjg
<djblazekin> i'm close to getting 1st prestiege in black ops
<CrystalPhoenix> SuperBrony64, now where did you get that description?
<MadSurge> Yay, creepy Zelda again! :$
<oni_link> first the HL3 beta and now this
<oni_link> SuperBrony64: you better not be yanking my chain ;3;
<CrystalPhoenix> Ha
<oni_link> its using the same counter as this http://halflife3beta.com/
<CrystalPhoenix> there's something fishy about this countdown
<oni_link> whats so significant about the 21st?
<JRP2234> Phase4 ps2 direct x
<Jmo> Terrible Fate is an album dedicated to Zelda.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02"One last info in the game is you’ll meet with a mysterious character in the game, similar to the Happy Mask salesman named Fahra. She’ll give helpful pointers to Link through his journey. Her face is covered with many masks that she carries in a satchel that show off her emotions."
<CrystalPhoenix> like how it's revealed in the "end of the world"
<CrystalPhoenix> Yeah no this ain't an official entry
<oni_link> I really want to believe this is real but Im not putting my eggs in the basket quite yet
<CrystalPhoenix> oni_link, or it is real
<CrystalPhoenix> it's just not from Nintendo
<Ninjazz> What's there to invest? You're all playing the waiting game anyway.
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 have a lick
*JRP2234 licks SuperBrony64
<oni_link> CrystalPhoenix: Yeah, Im just wondering exactly what the heck is gonna happen when the timer reaches zero
<CrystalPhoenix> my guess
<CrystalPhoenix> an album of remix
<oni_link> I think so too
<CrystalPhoenix> the guy looks like to be a musician
<oni_link> looking the facebook linked to the page
<oni_link> *at
<oni_link> you can see hes done more work like that
<CrystalPhoenix> and how the countdown reach "the end of the world" in a non-professional way
<JRP2234> wrek how do i play ps2?
<oni_link> yup
<CrystalPhoenix> it makes really suspicious that it's actually Nintendo
<oni_link> JRP2234: buttons :D ba dum tch
<oni_link> CrystalPhoenix: I really would love Nintendo to get back to the darker Zelda I grew up with though
<oni_link> OOT and MA were epic
<djblazekin> they need a combat training mode like c o d
<CrystalPhoenix> meh
<oni_link> nothing has met my expectations since then
<CrystalPhoenix> Nintendo right now is casualized same old thing except it's over glorified
<JRP2234> if nintendo were smart they would port majoras mask to 3ds
<JRP2234> the 3ds oot is an excellent port
<JRP2234> all the bugs from the n64 are there
<CrystalPhoenix> JRP2234, that would most likely happen
<oni_link> Yeah but Zelda seems to be getting more and more watered down
<djblazekin> kinda like square not giving us ffvii hd
<CrystalPhoenix> oni_link, welcome to this generation of console gaming
<JRP2234> can i ask a question
<pony_9830> Crysis 5?
<JRP2234> WHO THE FUCK IS JOHN MADDIN
<CrystalPhoenix> djblazekin, maybe they have thought of that but haven't decide to pursue any action because it's not time
<djblazekin> some former football coach JRP2234
<CrystalPhoenix> JRP2234, you've watched AVGN haven't you
<JRP2234> MABEH
<JRP2234> no
<JRP2234> your ruby is crap
<JRP2234> afl is the way to go
<oni_link> Skyward Sword was dissapointing artistically . It had lots of room for really dark and genuinely good designs but they made it too happy. Zelda is going the Mario route with happy faces and a lack of dark and scarier things
<AdamTheDuck> JRP2234, they say he's a ghost astronaut on the moon who comes out at night to feed on the patriotism of other lost astronauts
<Ninjazz> There was an old game just like that, Adam.
<oni_link> this generation of consoles sucks :c halo was a disappointment to me, COD is COD. everything looks like its losing its luster
<oni_link> or theyre bleeding it dry
<AdamTheDuck> oni_link, go back to the old classics.
<oni_link> I do
<oni_link> all the time
<AdamTheDuck> ^_^
<AdamTheDuck> I really need to play STALKER again...
<djblazekin> AdamTheDuck: i've got a ps2 for that reason
<AdamTheDuck> But so many other games to play too ;~;
<AdamTheDuck> and PS2 with BronyState as well
<oni_link> AdamTheDuck: Im gonna play that game when my tower is done :)
<oni_link> that too!
<oni_link> I would love to be able to play a sequel to MM though
<JRP2234> any noticed avgn has not used his song for the past 3 eps?
<djblazekin> i ment playstation 2
<oni_link> with the same art style but with todays graphics
<oni_link> Im asking for too much though. Nintendo doesn't deliver anymore
<djblazekin> if you can find one oni_link get a 60gb ps3 and then you'll be set for todays and yesteryears titles
<oni_link> only reason I'd get a PS3 would be for MGS4
<jcelios> good morning my little ponies
<JRP2234> um the new avgn ep is stuck at 2,827
<oni_link> other than that, Im not too crazy about Sony's exclusives
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' jcelios
<oni_link> hey jcelios
<AdamTheDuck> I want to get a 3DS for Professor Layton ;~;
<Gold_Demona> iyo jcelios
<Gold_Demona> hiyo*
<oni_link> AdamTheDuck: I heard good things about that game
<AdamTheDuck> Loved the first and second game...
<AdamTheDuck> Then my DS broke ;~;
<djblazekin> you might want to pick up mgs hd collection and mgs1 with mgs4 chronolocicly for story it goes peacewalker 3 1 2 then 4
<JRP2234> its hard to play ps2 WHEN IT FUCKING CRASHES ON START
<oni_link> djblazekin: Yeah I know my MGS story :P 4 is the only one I havent played along with peacewalker
*AdamTheDuck slaps JRP2234 around a bit with a large trout
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: I has the 3DS paper mario :)
<JRP2234> Phase4
<JRP2234> somthing worng
<oni_link> MadSurge: How is that game?
<jcelios> I love me some PS1 and PS2 era MGS ^.^
*SuperBrony64 hugs AdamTheDuck
<djblazekin> peacewalker comes before 3 in the story and 4 is the finisher mgs rising i think is a side story to mgs2
<MadSurge> oni_link: People got mad because it doesn't have a big plot and it has a bizarre attack gimmick, but I think it's not so bad
*AdamTheDuck licks SuperBrony64 :3
<oni_link> MadSurge: is it similar to Super Paper Mario?
<MadSurge> oni_link: you mean more platformey? Kinda
<djblazekin> i think so from the small bit i've played
<oni_link> MadSurge: Did they go back to the turn based gameplay though?
<djblazekin> i dont think so
<MadSurge> oni_link: yes, but you don't have partners (you don't really need them abyway)
<MadSurge> *n
<oni_link> MadSurge: I think I want to pick it up then. I prefer the turn based style to the way Super Paper Mario did things. The first one was still my favorite
<MadSurge> oni_link: the first one was nice :) it's just bizarre that the others tried to make epic plots... with freaking Super Mario
<oni_link> MadSurge: Just like sonic XD we know what our objective is, there's no need to stretch it out and make it seem more complicated than it really is! you just add a whole lot of dialogue that no one wants to be bothered with!
<CriticKitten> .....The Hub picked up Animaniacs?
<oni_link> I saw that on Facebook :o
<CriticKitten> When did this happen?!?
<MadSurge> oni_link: yeah, but also, there's monsters destroying the world... and you're still stomping GOOMBAS.
<JRP2234> kljoffeewewoeiropweiieropw
<JRP2234> Phase4`
<MadSurge> CriticKitten: a while ago, I think
<oni_link> MadSurge: it sounds fun :3
<CriticKitten> Well that makes me excited. ^^
<MadSurge> oni_link: in the newer one it's just Bowser getting powerful through magic stickers :D nothing complicated :D
<oni_link> MadSurge: awesome!
<CrystalPhoenix> That is....the most perfect, accurate, awesome cosplay I've ever witnesses. http://25.media.tumblr.com/aa7c902e94a98c7624804c915f16e812/tumblr_mf7u3aSB3x1qbnnp7o1_500.jpg
<oni_link> well crap
<aniderp|bestcakeever> dat jaymoo here?
<oni_link> that is epic
<CrystalPhoenix> it puts every cosplayer to shame
<aniderp|bestcakeever> Gold_Demona: lurk?
*Gold_Demona lurks
<MadSurge> CrystalPhoenix: :D better than the super accurate ones!
<CrystalPhoenix> MadSurge, what are you talking about
*aniderp|bestcakeever hands muffin to Gold_Demona
<CrystalPhoenix> This one is the most accurate
*Gold_Demona eats muffin in the shadows. :3
<MadSurge> CrystalPhoenix: the ones more truthful to Advent Children then :D
<CrystalPhoenix> Advent Children?
<djblazekin> is that supposed to be cloud
<CrystalPhoenix> What is this Advent Childrean you speak of?
<CrystalPhoenix> *sarcasm
<djblazekin> its the ffvii movie that takes place after 7
<Gold_Demona> Two years after FF7, if I remember right
<djblazekin> crisis core is a prequal to 7 idk where dirge of cerberus falls in the ffvii story
*CrystalPhoenix points at my post that says *sarcasm
<Gold_Demona> I'm pretty sure Dirge of Cerberus happens after, but we see flashbacks of Vincent's past.
<djblazekin> i just finished 7 and watched advent children

<aniderp|bestcakeever> saturday it will
<aniderp|bestcakeever> friday it wont snow now only rain
<jcelios> I'm kinda creeped out how there are always like 80 people in the channel who i've never seen speak :o
<djblazekin> i can bring up a seven day forcast for florida on the wii
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i can too xD
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i know how to tell time in other countries like japan!
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ipod tells me :P
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hey Gold_Demona what is cupertino?
<djblazekin> i went to the grocery store and i couldnt find zingers or twinkies or hohos
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Hell if I know
<jcelios> aniderp|bestcakeever: is where Apple lives
<Gold_Demona> djblazekin: That's because the company that owned those things no longer exists.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ohh apple lives in cupertino
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ok then!
<djblazekin> kellog needs to buy thoes properties i need twinkies for the comming end of the world
<jcelios> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California
<jcelios> It's where all the Apple lay lines of the world converge
<Gold_Demona> djblazekin: Why kellog specifically? O_o
<djblazekin> kellogs or post
<Gold_Demona> But they're cereal companies...
<aniderp|bestcakeever> what part of florida are you in Gold_Demona ?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i wanna input in my ipod for the weather thingy :P
<djblazekin> one of them make fruit rollups and fruity gushers
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Central Florida. Just a little south of Daytona Beach.

<Gold_Demona> Fruit snacks aren't really the same thing as snackie cakes. =/
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: If you wanna get specific, I'm in Deltona
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ohh i got a chirstmas tree snackie cake
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hopefully it still there.. i found it yesterday o.O
<Gold_Demona> djblazekin: I'd say Little Debbie would be more likely to buy them up.
<Gold_Demona> Cuz they're a snackie food company
<jcelios> Google should buy them
<aniderp|bestcakeever> no
<Gold_Demona> lol
<djblazekin> or betty crocker

<aniderp|bestcakeever> i can find a picture of food then lick my laptop?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> c=xD
<jcelios> c=xD looks like some weird engineering equation
<djblazekin> holograms have no flavor i went to mikuopolous and the miku hologram got her hand in my teeth and i tasted nothing
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: but all you'd get from that is the flavor of the screen. XD
<aniderp|bestcakeever> my screen needs to be clean before i lick it
<aniderp|bestcakeever> or i could get sick D:
<Gold_Demona> Eeyup

<djblazekin> would sibsy have a chance she is the only pegisus with a car if she had a suped up bugatti veyron with nos would she be rainbow dash 1/4 mile drag
<Kammerjunk> Jake: Steven Magnet
<Kammerjunk> For Steven Magnet is all.
<Jake> if they both start from the ground then it would be possible
<djblazekin> stock bugatti hits 261 mph but i suped one up on gt5 and it hits around 401 mph straight road with nos it would probably hit 436mph
<MadSurge> Do they want you to take a picture? :D
<jcelios> stream can't handle da graphix
<Jake> Kammerjunk: if steven is in the new desktop ponies i'll do that just for you

<djblazekin> my local anime con is thinkig of having a 50 shades of grey dramatic reading pannle do you think it will go well
<RoboGerbil> djblazekin: how many guys are gonna read the entire thing with no female presence?
<Kammerjunk> djblazekin: If they replace "dramatic reading" with "Mario impression," maybe.
<djblazekin> there will be females but zapp branigan will be the narrorator

<Kammerjunk> And with outfit, he means team. In the game.
<Kandarihu> djblazekin, that's a really trashy novel
<Kammerjunk> Virtually.
<RoboGerbil> Kammerjunk: more like guild
<RoboGerbil> but less gay
<djblazekin> sad to say emma watson wants a role in the movie adaptation of it
<Kammerjunk> RoboGerbil: I don't see the difference. A bunch of people together.
<RoboGerbil> ok yeh.. its a sausage fest
<djblazekin> there were alot of females at the derpy dose dallas pannel
<djblazekin> the room was packed
<Kammerjunk> djblazekin: I don't think I want to know what that's about.
<Kammerjunk> Because I know what debbie Does Dallas is about.

<CTHULHU> the movie sucked
<Kammerjunk> My point is that it was a porno.

<Twilight> hi
<Kammerjunk> Bit too late for that, mate. If it exists.
<Ninjazz|Busy> It was inevitable.
<djblazekin> we all agreed that rarity is the high maintnence gold digger gf
<Barbetos> Yeah. It exsists. I know that. Its just going to get out of control, and when the word brony is said it will be tagged with the stigma of furries.
<Kammerjunk> Barbetos: Hell, there's even R34 of King Sombro and the G-word which shall not be named.
