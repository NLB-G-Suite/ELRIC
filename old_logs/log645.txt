<Lyra`> Wrek is ______
<Lyra`> Glorious
<Yahooz> Ponymon-Anarchy: @ or OP is a channel Operator, % or halfOP has OP abilities, but less channel acess generally, + or voice can talk in +m rooms
<tSparx> Ponymon-Anarchy: It's indicative of your role in the channel. @=mod/chan-ops, %=pseudo-mod/half-chan-ops, and +, which means that when the chan-mode is +m (muted), the + peeps can still talk
<Hipster-Pony> dat fast typing
<Lyra`> handsome, cute, funny, witty, smart, huggable, adorable, talented, strong, fast, magic, and a friend

<Azureflames901> You would think they could hear him
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/2sme/
<Dark92Enigma> Sorry
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: did you turn off the transmitter before sarif told you to?
<DerpyMuffins> So this is a whore house basicly?
<Reikim|GW2> No
<flutter_spin> but there aren't any ponies
<Reikim|GW2> It's a hotel where young women meet with rich men to engage in business matters.
<d3rb> ^
<Reikim|GW2> Many profitable deals are turned each day.
<SirGanjalf> DerpyMuffins: "Gentlemen club"
<thelonepony> boom headshot
<Shizuka> 13oblivious, party of four, your brothel is ready
*afkirz sees empty lines in the chat window
<DerpyMuffins> These are some stupid AIs
<Shizuka> 13i love moving bodies while cloaked, everyone flips out
<Cypresswolf> Hello Shizu :)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14iirc, they actually seel official replicas of his jacket
<flutter_spin> we just want some alone time
<SirGanjalf> Coming to a brothel with no money/credit cards?
<Shizuka> 13ded
<Reikim|GW2> Ghosts man
<Reikim|GW2> Dem ghosts
<Cynder7> 6Hi again ^^
<Shizuka> 13protip sumica you can left click throw while moving them :3
<flutter_spin> kick him
<flutter_spin> nooooooooo
<Shizuka> 13:)
<Reikim|GW2> SaxyPretender: Gotta level with you, man. Jensen's jacket is just cooler than yours. Sorry.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I am not denying htat
<Shizuka> 13deeeeed
<Reikim|GW2> If I could have Jensen's jacket...
<Reikim|GW2> No
<Reikim|GW2> That isn't quite right.
<Reikim|GW2> Here, I'll demonstrate.
<Klumzeedragon> Sumi: If you needed to shoot something, why not the whole club? :P
<flutter_spin> I really couldn't get into this game.
<SirGanjalf> If I could have Jensen's shades...
*LadyCanary peeks into chat.
<Meanwhile|Recording> Deeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaad
<Meanwhile|Recording> Argh
*Shizuka 13pounces canary canary~
<Meanwhile|Recording> Deeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaad
<LadyCanary> Eeep!
<LadyCanary> Hiya Shizu <3
<Shizuka> 13:3
<LadyCanary> Lemme guess...this a Sumi stream? :o
<Shizuka> 13niiiiiice
<Shizuka> 130.4 to spare
<Cades> hey
<Reikim|GW2> The best part is that Jensen's coat is actually modified so that his snazzy arm blades/skin-planted bomb launchers don't rip it.
<Reikim|GW2> It is the coolest coat ever.
<LadyCanary> Why yes it is!!!! Hiya Sumi :3333
<Bronysith> dat LadyCanary shoutout
<Shizuka> 13i think the best i did on my legitimate run was 0.5
<flutter_spin> lol
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Flash Animation: Octavia and Maestro perform in a concert / Aces of Harmony
<flutter_spin> My cabbage
<Cades> i love marshmallows
<Shizuka> 13just what i was thinking :3
<twilight_sprinkle> dat shinra
<SirGanjalf> woah cabbage for 99 cents/bits/whatever they have in China
<Cynder7> 6Same..I haven't had any for 2 years though.. ._.
<Phase4> 00,02BerryPunch!
<Phase4> 00,02y u no bug
<Cades> aww :(
<Reikim|GW2> China's running on the yuan, iirc
<LadyCanary> Candybars?
<flutter_spin> lol
<Shizuka> 13you hit them in the head sumica, they only have like 1hp
<Reikim|GW2> :kickcount
<BerryPunch> Reikim|GW2: This command requires at least 1 parameters.
<Phase4> 00,02theres a timeout bug in BerryPunch
<flutter_spin> the trashcan is evil
<Reikim|GW2> :kickcount Reikim
<BerryPunch> Reikim|GW2: Reikim has been kicked 3 times
<Phase4> 00,02but now i'm monitoring it, the bug isnt happening
<Reikim|GW2> yey
<PillowPoni> dat timing
<Reikim|GW2> It's the same reason, Phase, that water never boils while you look at it.
<Obsidian> I'm back
<Shizuka> 13i dunno i lethal TKOd those two last run, no one eeeeever looks there
<Reikim|GW2> You have to turn your back for water to boil.
<Ponies47> BRB
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Phase4, clearly it's a quantum bug
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Cades> its suprising how many people don't know that activision is
<Reikim|GW2> It's called "the universe is being a snarky bastard and is screwing with you".
<flutter_spin> fire.
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Shizuka> 13last run i killed everyone in the hive club after finishing tong's thing
<Moopy> Ohhh my
<Reikim|GW2> You must really hate the Hive, Shizu.
<Shizuka> 13and then malik wanted to do her side quest, so here's a guy getting a lap dance in a club full of bodies
<Reikim|GW2> Can't fathom why, though.
<Reikim|GW2> U,m
<Reikim|GW2> Um
<Obsidian> Who's playing?
<Reikim|GW2> That's weird
<Cades> im screwing around on omegle and apparently theres alot of people that don't know
<flutter_spin> At the very beginning, when I was searching through the desk and stuff, the lady would not shut up about hurrying me out the door. My first time I just wanted to kill someone
<Reikim|GW2> Perhaps he's a necrophiliac?
<flutter_spin> Then when I DID leave, I found out there was a toy car. I was so angry.
<Shizuka> 13time to take out the adorable trash
*Ponies47 Returns
<Bronysith> Sumica: let go of that trashcan or your shins
<Reikim|GW2> The one time I broke down was in Hengsha, when you track down that Orpheus guy.
<Shizuka> 13this sarif industries weighted companion dumpster will accompany you through the test chamber
<Reikim|GW2> Or whatever he's called.
<Cynder7> 6:O
<LadyCanary> Shizu is silliest filly.
<flutter_spin> At Sbarros, I actually came up with a little song. "I'm the trashman! ... Taking out the trash! You put this thing there and that thing here. All of these things Go In The Trash! Because I'm the trashman. Taking out the trash."
<Shizuka> 13my physics are augmented
<Cades> What question should I ask for spy mode?
<Reikim|GW2> I honestly tried my hardest to take down the enemies non-lethally. I honestly did. But then I got fed up with it, sat in a shadowy corner, and just sniped them with my handgun.
<Shizuka> 13i think you reach that fence from the other side, there's a different one with a hole at the ground
<Obsidian> Insermountable Knee High fence
<Bronysith> dat game crash
<Bronysith> no wait
<Reikim|GW2> It's rather depressingly amusing to see the AI see a body, wander over it, look around, get shot in the face...and then see another enemy do it right after.
<Bronysith> he just aint moving
<FillyFlam> Can't tell if stream lag or Sumica tabbed out.
<Bronysith> Sumica: dont you just love that?
<Reikim|GW2> In fact, this entire game is full of really depressing stupidity.
<flutter_spin> Reikim|GW2: I played maybe 3 hours and quit. I'll come back to the game if I get bored
<Cynder7> 6Spy mode?
<Reikim|GW2> It's the AI. It's really easy to manipulate.
<Reikim|GW2> I think by the end I had something like fifteen bodies piled on the same exact point.
<Shizuka> 13the high jump aug isn't terribly worthwhile
<Kinixys> Maybe you can stand it on it's end?
<Cades> never mind lol
<Reikim|GW2> Take the Landing System as soon as you can, because there's nothing more embarrassing than death by ground.
<flutter_spin> fly aug?
<Shizuka> 13there's lots of invisible walls once you have the high jump too
<flutter_spin> Hulk Smash!
<Kinixys> Can't climb that recycle bin?
<Reikim|GW2> Is this back in Detroit?
<Reikim|GW2> Near the police station?
<Shizuka> 13hengsha rei
<Reikim|GW2> Hm
<Reikim|GW2> I don't remember anything like that in Hengsha
<flutter_spin> Don't jump up, bring it down to you! :P
<Shizuka> 13heee rooooode a blazing dumpsterrrr
*Reikim|GW2 opens stream despite himself
<Shizuka> 13he wore a shining star (?)
<flutter_spin> Do you even have a goal? Like you're sightseeing
<Shizuka> 13has the main quest and a side mission going
<MrMalk> Is this fantasy or real?
<Kinixys> You can get extras?
<Reikim|GW2> What is real?
<Shizuka> 13that load screen... is a bit disturbing..... sarif is offering typhoon to people other than adam and the military?
<Reikim|GW2> What?
<Reikim|GW2> I don't remember that.
<MrMalk> Buy Jump Augment
<Obsidian> Shizuka: Not everyone has the Typhoon upgrade so the ammo would be useless
<Reikim|GW2> Jump Augment is useless, take the x-ray vision and the wall-punch for tons of fun.
<Reikim|GW2> Imagine being that one poor mook.
<Reikim|GW2> You're just patrolling along, going about your day, feeling like a big man with your gun and your swag.
<Reikim|GW2> Suddenly, a METAL HAND comes punching through the wall, and breaks your neck.
<Reikim|GW2> Embarrassing way to die.
<MrMalk> jump
<MrMalk> Brain Is very important
<Hipster-Pony> guys I'm gonna go now
<Obsidian> Bye Hipster-Pony
<Hipster-Pony> Need to draw

<otakon> Sumica: you need another dumpster
<Cypresswolf> MrMalk: I'll try to stay silent til then :)
<otakon> Also, why the HELL does it take battery power to lift/melee in this game?
<MrMalk> Cypresswolf "TRY
<MrMalk> Keyword
<flutter_spin> lol
<Cypresswolf> I will say, the drinking ponies panel I was most looking forward was canceled just before Whooves Line ended - :D Like the hotel staff was tipped of "They're going to do WHAT? "
<otakon> D'OH!
<Shizuka> 13oh wow there is stuff up there
<otakon> Sumica: there is another way I'm sure
<MrMalk> Should have gotten jump upgrade Sumica

<flutter_spin> just move some stuff to the bottomleft
<Obsidian> *Totally
<Bronysith> Sumica: you should get a TARDIS style inventory

<MrMalk> Cypresswolf I thought we where waiting for story time
<flutter_spin> but the strippers are already stunning

<Sumica> 00,10room temtature is a subjective term
<Spectrum_Rush> DashWithRainbows: Inject? Don't you mean transfusion
<Klumzeedragon> Ghosties: Room-temp is best water. Cold is only good when it's hotter than hell.
<SpeedyBolt> The only things I like but never drink are Coke and Tea.
<Meanwhile> I could drink room temp milk if I lived in an igloo.
<Kammerjunk> I can't drink anything room-temperature. Either it's freezing cold or boiling hot.
<DashWithRainbows> Nope, I meant inject. :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Ghosties for the next time years you will only drink fresh milk from the cow
<Canadian_Brony> I have tasted water in a water bottle that has sat in a car for an hour on a hot summer day.

<Canadian_Brony> Sumica I can't find a HQ Rainbow Dash plushie that won't kill my life savings. My biggest problem, though, is finding a plushie I like.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man that would be neat to have SC on 3ds
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, the game reference in that picture is Street Fighter 3
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> huh i only played Alpha 3
<Sumica> 00,10yeah well the AJ's that are well done are not exactly cheap either

<Canadian_Brony> if any at all
<Klumzeedragon> SaxyPretender: WE don't talk about SC 4 here. :| And I loved 2 cause I had Link on the GameCube. :D But SC5 is great. I need to play it more.

<Spectrum_Rush> sub06905: yeah i'd say
<Klumzeedragon> SaxyPretender: Really? I haven't messed around with 5 too much. But I like Z.W.E.I. and Seigfried. :D But I need to practice more. I play a few bad rounds and I don't touch it for weeks.
<Klumzeedragon> flutterchu: Sure thing. Give me a minute.
<flutterchu> sub06905: well it iz perfect texture and it lokz more nice and fluffy than other plushie's
*sub06905 has $80 now <.<
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> sub06905: worth the price,seen better ones but WAY overpriced like 200+ for a mane 6 and 50 extra if ya want an OC
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Z.W.E.I.'s pretty neat, my favorite of the new characters aside from Natsu
<Canadian_Brony> sub06905 absolutely. For that quality, $80 is great. My problem is RD has too many details to get inexpensive and high quality.
<thelonepony> back From doing the laundry, what did i miss?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah I can see spending 80 on that
<sub06905> so tempted to buy

<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Silver_Spoon: Hi! :)
<thelonepony> Hi Silver_Spoon
<sub06905> confound target for running out of mlp cards :|
<Canadian_Brony> Why can I never find any pony merch? Hopefully the Target opening next spring will sell it, but the Zellers it's replacing didn't carry pony merch and I can't walk to our only Wal-Mart
<Brad_> Canadian_Brony, yeah we get target in canada now! bye bye zellers...
<Canadian_Brony> It will not be missed
<Canadian_Brony> right?
<Brad_> agreed
<Sumica> 00,10dat magic blending tool
<Basenji> I never cared for zellers
<Brad_> zellers was poorly ran
<Brad_> Basenji, its a canadian target-like store
<Ghosties> 04God, Max is so flippin' talented
<thelonepony> what are Zellers?
<BladedWings|Away> Ghosties: ikr!?
<Brad_> target has so much buying power, the prices will be better than zellers.
<Klumzeedragon> I don't have any MLP paraphernalia. :P What should I buy first?
<Brad_> thelonepony, zellers is the canadian equivalent to target
<Canadian_Brony> thelonepony a store up here in Canada that's going out of buissness
<Brad_> Target bought out all the zellers
<Canadian_Brony> Klumzeedragon para-what?
<Silver_Spoon> is this SAI?
<thelonepony> oh
<Sumica> 00,10blind bags are a good place to start
<sub06905> it was quite funny when i was at target and someone called to ask if they carried cod: mw4 :D
<Basenji> though i did catch the closing sale at the zellers here had some ok deals
<Brad_> Sumica, whats the deal with blind bags?
<Brad_> just a random toy or what?
<Sumica> 00,10random in a sence yes
<Cynder7> 6xD
<Canadian_Brony> sub06905 "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4" or "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare"?
<Klumzeedragon> Canadian_Brony: It means equipment and stuff like that. Usually used in terms with drugs. :D
<MrMalk> OMG is that a DS?
<flutterchu> Brad_: what's a blindbag?
<Canadian_Brony> MrMalk eeyup
<Ghosties> 04Seems that way, MrMalk
<Brad_> flutterchu, thats what I asked
<Brad_> :P
<Sumica> 00,10you can know what toy it is by the code stamped in to the back of the bag
<Brad_> Sumica, are there some that are more rare than others or something
<sub06905> Canadian_Brony: call of duty modern warfare 4 :D
<Sumica> 00,10but that is only if you know what code is for what toy
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<MrMalk> Candian_Brony that ds is the most important part
<Sumica> 00,10and there are diffrent sets
<Brad_> whats the most saught after one?
<Brad_> and how much do they usually cost?
<Sumica> 00,10no clue as to what is most soght after but each set had like "rare" versions
<Canadian_Brony> Klumzeedragon oh. You can get t-shirts on RedBubble and I got a slick wristband for $12 including shipping, seeing it got here from Kansas
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: I may have to try one. Blind bags are such a gamble though. :D
<Sumica> 00,10they cost like buck99
<Spectrum_Rush> and if the code is stamped properly on the bag sumi sometimes its messed up so you cant tell 100%
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> DAT PUN
<Sumica> 00,10look up a code list
<sub06905> im scared to pull out something pony infront of my brony friends now last time i pulled out the mlp tattoos they went batshit crazy :D
<Brad_> Oh cool. also just read that they are all solid plastic, no stupid hair :P
<Sumica> 00,10never seen one with a bad stamp
<Canadian_Brony> I just want a Rainbow Dash toy that doesn't look, or is, G3
<Dermathil> Heeeey
<Sumica> 00,10yeah they are the most like the show.
<Klumzeedragon> Canadian_Brony: Yeah. I was just looking at Hot Topic's shirt. Not a very broad selection.
<flutterchu> Canadian_Brony: i want gen 4 NEVER TO BE PLANNED AS GEN 4.5
<Sumica> 00,10no mind you they can still be a bit messed up
<Dermathil> Hey everyone
<Silver_Spoon> My favorite so far is Firecracker Burst, as far as Blindbag exclusive ponies
<Spectrum_Rush> just a machine error Sumica , just something that happens sometimes
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Dermathil: Hi! :)

<SuperBrony64> 11,02If a tree falls in the woods and no-one is around to hear it...I'll buy the soundtrack.
<Meanwhile> The fact that you find it amusing is weird.
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Sumica: Isn't hard, when you've got a library card! :P

<PillowPoni|Phone> Canadian_Brony, you must be the test kick for saying (REDACTED)
<Sumica> 00,10all it realy is. is a modified curseword script

<Sumica> 00,10I just have to clear my count to do that too DashWithRainbows
<DashWithRainbows> True.
<Polydunami> AJIsAwesome|Tired, the sound is from vibrations that go into your ear. Didn't Bill Nye teach you anything?
<DashWithRainbows> But surely a 700+ kick count seems something not to waste? :3
<Klumzeedragon> So many shirts on Red Bubble... So little cash.
<meh> if you modify it does it still kick for curses too?
<Sumica> 00,10I do now Canadian_Brony, it's just set to think of Fight club as a curse word
<Meanwhile> RashWithDainbows.

<Phase4> 00,02SKOG MC NORD
<AdamTheDuck> CrimsonPhoenix, you can buy Skyrim on PC and plug in your xbox/ps3 controller and play as if it was on console but along with all the mods and stuff
<Phase4> 00,02LORD OF FIRE

<meh> oh cool
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, spells like calm makes then neutral towards you and not attack you for a certain amount of tiem
<AdamTheDuck> and there's rage which makes them attack everyone around them
<meh> well stay crouched a lot your sneak will go up eventually
<AdamTheDuck> So as a stealth based magick user, you can get your enemies to kill each other
<meh> yeah
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<AdamTheDuck> that and illusion has invisibility spells
<Phase4> 00,02i'll look at those when i have more money
<meh> if you max your sneak you can almost be hidden in plain sight all the time
<CrimsonPhoenix> I ran rogue ranger in skyrim
<CrimsonPhoenix> had stealth pretty high up there
<AdamTheDuck> I always loved illusion :3

<MadSurge> Hello Saturn! How's your boyfriend?
<AdamTheDuck> It's so quiet now that flutterchu stopped spamming those image links :<
*AdamTheDuck likes peace and quiet
*Saturn 08,01pies AdamTheDuck
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: good! but we're both kinda sad that i'm leaving today
<MadSurge> Saturn: aww, for where?
<RaveBrony> Oh hey, Saturn :)
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: back home to soctland
<Saturn> 08,01my boyfriend lives in tthe netherlands
<MadSurge> Awww :) you made it all the way there? so romantic :)
<PsychoticDoc> romance is getting excedingly hard to kill these days. i think its for the best though
<RaveBrony> To kill? o.o
<PsychoticDoc> end/sever/etc
<PsychoticDoc> its really up to anybodys preferance
<RaveBrony> I like romance D:
<PsychoticDoc> and i said that i think its good that its hard to kill
<RaveBrony> Unfortunately i prefer old style romance, something women dont fully appreciate anymore =_=
<PsychoticDoc> honestly, its like people take things out of context on purpose or something...
<AdamTheDuck> RaveBrony, old style?
<RaveBrony> You know, classic stuff :D Flowers, art, little things.
<AdamTheDuck> Wait, people don't do that anymore?
<RaveBrony> Many woem ni know dont expect such things.
<PsychoticDoc> its shame, its like chocolate is a poor choice for close quarters romance or something...
<RaveBrony> *women
<RaveBrony> Plus barely anyone acts like a gentleman anymore...
<Saturn> 08,01i have my own special brand of romance, generally involving putting the chocolate *onto* my partner...
<RaveBrony> o.o
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, oh you. :D
<RaveBrony> Well, makes it taste 10x better im sure :D
<PsychoticDoc> I prefer the classic gentlemenly class approach. sadly i havnt met anybody deserving of it
<AdamTheDuck> You never cease to get out of my attension spotlight :D
<AdamTheDuck> Classy gentlemen, something that has been lacking in today's society. :3
<RaveBrony> Yep yep
<PsychoticDoc> screw swag, class is what people need
<RaveBrony> I was a complete gentleman in my last relationship... seh didnt care for it =.=
<RaveBrony> *she
<Saturn> 08,01my boyfriend took me to a spa
<Saturn> 08,01now thats classy
<RaveBrony> Luckyyyy

<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, but you're forgetting the pinkie up! The higher your pinkie, the fancier you are!
<RaveBrony> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Sponge Bob taught me well... :D
<PsychoticDoc> im a guy, but i want to go to the spa, my feet are freackin ugly
<Saturn> 08,01AdamTheDuck: well, i did have my pinkie pretty far up him at one pkoint...

<Phase4> 00,02: D
<Phase4> 00,02this game is AWESOME
<PsychoticDoc> lolololololololol
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Phase4> 00,02this bit is not gona be fun is it
<PsychoticDoc> i hated this part when i played
<meh> cant kill them or something?
<PsychoticDoc> you can, but they are really fast
<PsychoticDoc> use the typhoon!!!!
<RaveBrony> o.o
<PsychoticDoc> that was oddly close
<PsychoticDoc> well you guys, later, school is moaning my name in a very unerotic fashion
<RaveBrony> Alright, cya PsychoticDoc!
<meh> good luck with that cya round PsychoticDoc
<RaveBrony> o_o
<meh> are you doing non lethal?
<meh> ill take that as a no
<RaveBrony> :o
<meh> why cant more games be like this where they outline objects in bright orange
<Nyst> Sometimes they make objects sparkle.
<Dark_Horst> meh: you cant get past that part nonleathaö
<Nyst> But, a lot of people initially complained that the objects were outlined like this.
<Dark_Horst> *l
<Nyst> I managed to complete the game nonlethally. I only killed the bosses, but managed to not kill anyone else.
<Dark_Horst> Nyst: that lot of people obviously never bothered to check the display options that lets you turn off the outlne
<Nyst> Dark_Horst: they added that option precisely for those people who complained. This was back when the game was still in development.
<Dark_Horst> oh, okay then
<Malavolent> Ello there everybrony.
<meh> hi Malavolent
<RaveBrony> Hey Malavolent :P
<Dark_Horst> the outlines are damn usefull though. in the original games, back when polygons where expensive and levels had to be designed simple, you'd notice any important object immediately
<Dark_Horst> but finding that one credit chit in todays graphically amazing and completely cluttered with garbage dekss? good luck with that
<meh> ikr
<Dark_Horst> and that was one of the worst german accents i've ever heard
<Dark_Horst> peps would be useful here
<Saturn> 08,01hullo again
<Dark_Horst> hi Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01whats on the stream?

<ofna01> WHAT IS IT CALLED, AND HOW MUCH WAS IT
<ofna01> BACON
<Saturn> 08,01aecht schenkerla rauchbier urbock
<ofna01> :O
<Dark_Horst> you island people have weird tastes
<ofna01> Saturn, this may be an awkward question, but im not sure if your a girl or a boy. XD
<Saturn> 08,01had some really nice dark beers
<Dark_Horst> ofna01: he is what happens when you splice a male human with pinkie pie and science
<ofna01> SCIENCE
<Saturn> 08,01actually developed a nice appreciation for them
<ofna01> Dat AI
<ofna01> JENSEN SMASH
<Dark_Horst> he dedded them with a peps
<Dark_Horst> that's an art
<Saturn> 08,01ofna01: i get that a lot
<ofna01> ded with da peps
<Saturn> 08,01im a guy
<ofna01> Ah
<ofna01> Sorry, it was an awkward question
<Sylandest> no worries, ofna01
<Saturn> 08,01not at all!
<Dark_Horst> pfff, there is no awkward in here
<ofna01> I recently found Fallout 3 at my local Gamestop for 20 bucks, including all the DLC
<Dark_Horst> most uf us thought sumica was a girl for the longest time
<Dark_Horst> his avatar that wrek drew didnt help
<Dark_Horst> ofna01: was on steam once for 7 B)
<meh> hahaaha
<ofna01> Dark, my PC is ded
<Dark_Horst> that is a condition you hsould change
<ofna01> i need a whole new PC, it died the day i got MvM for TF2 XD
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<ofna01> Phase!
<Phase4> 00,02i know you can meet tagert here
<Phase4> 00,02really want to
<the_real_pony_1604> I just built myself a new PC last week
<Phase4> 00,02ofna01, ohai
<RaveBrony> I luckily joined Bronystate when people were on the topic of talking about Sumica being a guy :D
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<RaveBrony> So i knew right off the bat. Funny to see other think hes a girl tho.
<AdamTheDuck> Good ol' rule 63
<ofna01> i have the worst autosave ever on Fallout 3
<Phase4> 00,02its the name
<Dark_Horst> mine jsut needs upgrades. mainboard, cpu, ram and graphics card
<MadSurge> ofna01: I bet there's a few gay people here, no awkwardness :D
<Dark_Horst> that may sound like w hole new pc, but it'll cost only half as much
<ofna01> Makes sense to me.
<RaveBrony> However, I did think Saturn was a girl for a short time :D
<the_real_pony_1604> asus rampage iv extreme, 3930k, 16gigs of ram
<Dark_Horst> you dont need 16
<Dark_Horst> 8 are completely sufficient
<ofna01> my Xbox 360 has over 100+ gigs storage available
<RaveBrony> Then i discovered he was a manly man with pink hair!
<the_real_pony_1604> thats why I didn't get 16, but I do editing
<Phase4> 00,02thats too far back
<Phase4> 00,02i meen wouldnt be hard
<ofna01> WE MUST GO BACK FORWARD
<ofna01> TO THE FUTURE
<Phase4> 00,02everything betwene me and tagert is either knocked out or dead
<Phase4> 00,02but meh
<Phase4> 00,02ONWARD
<RaveBrony> :o
<the_real_pony_1604> it will go to 64, but I figured 16 would be enough for now
<Saturn> 08,01from nokw on, when people ask my gender, ill just say "tree"
<ofna01> I insulted you, didn't I saturn?
<RaveBrony> :D
<Saturn> 08,01gender: curry
<the_real_pony_1604> just say futa
<ofna01> I apologiza.
<Saturn> 08,01ofna01: of course not!
<AdamTheDuck> Tree is best gender :D
<RaveBrony> ^
<ofna01> This part was a bit creepy to me.
<Dark_Horst> skullfuck
<Saturn> 08,01futa is best gender
<RaveBrony> o_o
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<Dark_Horst> bomb has been planteed
<Sylandest> eeyup
<AdamTheDuck> I wished I never asked my friend what a futa was.
<ofna01> LOL
<RaveBrony> Hahaha
<ofna01> we need to show the Counter Strike: Global Offensive trailer...
<ofna01> That trailer was awesomesauce
<ofna01> EHHH RUSSIAN VODKA
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Dark_Horst> actually, saturn is right. think about it. every living form has the ultimate goal of reproducing to ensure it'S species survival. biologically, the ideal geneder
<RaveBrony> Oh god :D
<Dark_Horst> ...then again, that would probably throw natuaral population controll out the window
<RaveBrony> Meh, gross but very true, haha
<ofna01> futa is both genders isnt it?
<Dark_Horst> yes
<AdamTheDuck> ofna01, pretty much
<Saturn> 08,01futa is best of both worlds
<Sylandest> I obtain breakfast, come back, and find this topic...how silly of you lot
<RaveBrony> Females with dicks, right?
<Saturn> 08,01two sets of fun parts to play with
*RaveBrony grabs his stomach and covers his mouth
<RaveBrony> :D
<AdamTheDuck> You never cease to make me half-vomic-half-chuckle Saturn :D
<RaveBrony> ^
<Phase4> 00,02what am i suposed to do?
<Dark_Horst> ...i dont see the problem...
<Phase4> 00,02theres a thing
<Phase4> 00,02the glass thing
<Phase4> 00,02should have picked up a laser rifle
<Saturn> 08,01eachmeh, each to their own
<Phase4> 00,02dat malformed text
<Phase4> 00,02or not malformed
<Phase4> 00,02windows has screwy fonts
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: i think it has something to do with shooting the three wiredin women
<Dark_Horst> been a while sicne i did that
<Saturn> 08,01Koen says that those of you saying "eew" are probably secretly into it anyway :P
<ofna01> LOL
<RaveBrony> ._.
<AdamTheDuck> Haha I remember those statistics
<Dark_Horst> quite probably
<Phase4> 00,02Dark92Enigma, already did that though
<Sylandest> I lol-ed
<Phase4> 00,02i meen Dark_Horst
<Phase4> 00,02tab fail
<ofna01> it would probably throw me off a bit, to see a mans face with womans breasts....
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: somehow you have to open a window in the bosses defenses
<ofna01> JENSEN SMASH
<Dark_Horst> wrong button
<RaveBrony> Pffft, I like my women with their normal genitailia :D
<ofna01> same
<Dark_Horst> thatw as easy
<Saturn> 08,01ofna01: cant beat chicks with dicks.
<AdamTheDuck> :D
<ofna01> Saturn, I'll stick with the girlfriend I have now.
<ofna01> XD
<RaveBrony> ofna01: Good man :D
<Dark_Horst> BUTTONS!
<Dark_Horst> A, B, or C?
<ofna01> poosh booton
<Dark_Horst> there's also a D button
<MadSurge> Saturn: Nice mental image you gave me there :D Best of both worlds, eh?
<MadSurge> And apparently I killed the chat
<AdamTheDuck> Yes you did MadSurge
<Sylandest> meh
<ofna01> Basically, you either expose one of the bad groups, or kill yourself.
<Dark_Horst> boom button
<Dark_Horst> i pressed that
<ofna01> DA BOOM BUTTON
<Dark_Horst> not as spectacular as you might think
<ofna01> Phase DO THE BOOM BUTTON
<Dark_Horst> right button is desabled becasue you didnt speak to taggart
<Phase4> 00,02the darrow button seems closest to the truth
<Phase4> 00,02and thats what i'd like to say
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, i know, it disapoints me :(
<Phase4> 00,02middle button

<ofna01> Phase, you should stream some tekkit with meh
<Phase4> 00,02middle button cause i havent seen it
<twilight_sprinkle> this ending is bad and you should feel bad!
<Dark_Horst> at least that'S what i conclude7

<ofna01> :'(

<ofna01> in 21 days
<RaveBrony> Nice :o
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: did you already do the other ending?

<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: learning programming by yourself is pretty easy
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle do you know a good tutorial for a basic programming language ?
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: sorry no
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle than how can I learn it by myself?
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: i learned all ym stuff in school. but its really not that hard, the basics at least like looping and if statements
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: just find a tutorial online
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: idk any tutrials myself to sugget
<twilight_sprinkle> *suggest
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle ok :/
<ofna01> POOTIS
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle maybe I stumle upon a good one some day, the ones I've seen so far where rather... pointless and not well explained, and yeah, there is no school around here offering something like this :(
<twilight_sprinkle> http://imgur.com/CmqnX
<twilight_sprinkle> and why the hell is gangnam style in the comments ??????
<Lil_B> Dear Lord this OST is Amazing
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: i can try to explain the stuff i know, but ive only begun c++ and i cant explain in-depth
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle no need for that, I think programming is too big of a field for a beginner to explain it over a chat in his spare time XD

<RaveBrony> :)
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: then we think the same :) she's among my 3 favs!
<Wrek> 05now
<Wrek> 05what to play..
<MadSurge> Abuse? :D
<Wrek> 05too few peopel onlien to see me suffer
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Among the mane 6, AJ is number 4 on my list.
<RaveBrony> AJ does NOT get enough love D: There was even something on EqD aout it :D
<EveningBreeze> How could anypony decide on a favorite?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: 3rd
<RaveBrony> My favs are Rarity, (Pinkie or Twi), AJ, FS, and then RD
<RaveBrony> my ranks of favor, rather ^
<EveningBreeze> AJ would be like the best mom though, dont you think?
<killerpony7733> Wrek wanna go for tribes ascend?
<killerpony7733> I can play with ya
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: 4th is Rarity :D gotta love her hamminess
<RaveBrony> Muahaha! Just got my Scotsman Stove Pipe! :D
<MadSurge> EveningBreeze: yes, so much yes :)
<RaveBrony> for 1.33, sucker.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: My mane 6 order is as follows: Top fave is Pinkie. Rarity and Fluttershy fight over second and third. Then AJ. Then Rainbow. Then Twilight.
<Lil_B> RaveBrony (\ Rarity is best
<RaveBrony> Lil_B: /) ;)
<Gold_Demona> Rarity and Fluttershy used to fight over first and second, but Pinkie bounced her way up the list and now she's my top mane 6. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> for me its 1.twi 2.rarity 3. trixie. 3.9 luna 4. everyone else 5. fluttershy
<Wrek> 05the musi cis while i take my pick
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Pinkie/Fluttershy, AJ, Rarity, Twalaht and RD :D
<EveningBreeze> I don't understand why The Great and Powerful Trixie has so many fans... I think she's awful...
<Lil_B> ^
<Gold_Demona> EveningBreeze: You and me both.
<killerpony7733> Wrek alrighty~ i'm keeping the offer to play with ya in tribes if you so desire :P
<MadSurge> Basically, I like Andrea Libman :D
<twilight_sprinkle> EveningBreeze: because i have the feeling shes just insecure
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Good reason to like a character.
<Lil_B> My list: 1 Rarity, 2 Twilight, than a huge drop down, 3 RD, 4 Pinkie, 5 Fluttershy 6 Applejack
<Wrek> 05#1 Twilie #2: rest of mane 6 and prinesses etc
<EveningBreeze> Lil_B - that is VERY surprising to hear. thats an original order
<RaveBrony> Hehe
<MadSurge> Wrek: we know you like Twilie :)
<Barbetos|AtWork> Thats news to me
<RaveBrony> Far Princess is Luna. tabitha all the way! :D
<RaveBrony> *Fav
<RaveBrony> Wait, dafuq? Since when does Wrek like Twi? :o
<RaveBrony> I never knew >_>
<Sylandest> :D
<Wrek> 05RaveBrony: enough so that she's in most of my dreams
<Wrek> 05and not in a dirty way even! :D
<MadSurge> Wrek: :D
<RaveBrony> Oh geez :D
<Dark92Something> My Mane 6 order goes as this: Top favorite is :), then goes :O, then :D, and then >_>.......favorite Princess is LUNA.
<Lil_B> EveningBreeze really? I just like Rarity, and Twilight is just like me -.- and the rest... there is something about every one of them I really don't like -.-
<twilight_sprinkle> wish i dreamt of twi, or any pony for that matter, even fluttershy. instead i dream of weird stuff and/or zombies and ghosts :I
<Dark92Something> DERPED
<Dark92Something> HOLD ON
<RaveBrony> I dont dream of ponies :(
<Dark92Something> Here i go again
<MadSurge> I never dream of ponies, only weeeiiiird stuff or B-movie scenarios
<RaveBrony> I had a lucid dream last week. Best dream EVER! :[
<MadSurge> Ha twilight_sprinkle, we dream alike :D
<Wrek> 05haha
<twilight_sprinkle> MadSurge: sucks huh :(
<Wrek> 05FMLE crashed from the awesomeness
<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle: apart from no ponies... not so much :P
<RaveBrony> Well, i think it was a lucid dream... I wasnt able to make pionies appear O_o
<RaveBrony> *ponies
<Wrek> 05i have lucid dreams all the time :3
<Dark92Something> Wrek we dream alike
<Dark92Something> LAWL
<DocSane> RaveBrony: I've only managed to achieve a lucid dream for about 30 seconds (subjectively) What did you do in yours?
<RaveBrony> Im getting them more often. Ever since i started pinching myself in real life :D
<killerpony7733> I dream either rarely or it's too random and out there i can't remember them
<EveningBreeze> It's easier to find least favourites than normal favorites
<Lil_B> I think in terms of other Ponys... I think I kinda care for Luna and I really dig the Fez Pony XD
<killerpony7733> Wrek YES YES YES I LOVE YOU
<Barbetos|AtWork> oh nice
<RaveBrony> DocSane: It started off as an 'end of the world' dream. But when i got impailed in the foot and felt no pain i realized it was a dream and started blowing up shit! :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> You should try the Nameless Mod Wrek. Its a tc for this game.
<twilight_sprinkle> i only had lucid dreams as a kid when i had the same nightmare every night for 3 years
<RaveBrony> o_o
<killerpony7733> Barbetos|AtWork Heard of it never used it. But i honestly prefer the game Vanilla at any given time~
<Wrek> 05the weirdest thign is when you as a kid have a dream
<Wrek> 05then a few years laters in your teens you remember said dream
<Dark92Something> Top favorite is :), then goes :O and then :( and then :D then goes ;) then ;)........favorite background pony is :P (no question) and Favorite Princess is LUNA
<Wrek> 05and then after a while re-dream it exactly
<DocSane> RaveBrony: My lucid dream was very mundane, but odd. I found myself in what looked like a restaurant or a saloon.
<Dark92Something> I FORGOT AJ AGAIN......derped
<RaveBrony> What did you do? :D
<DocSane> RaveBrony: I noticed a guy behind the bar eating a ham sandwich. He looked Muslim, which I thought was odd because he was eating pork.
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: I've had that happen to me. It's freaky. o_o
<RaveBrony> DocSane: Lol :D
<DocSane> RaveBrony: I asked him "Am I dreaming?" to which he replied "Yes, as am I."
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good afternoon bronystate :)
<RaveBrony> o.o
<RaveBrony> Hey MLP_Brovakiin
<DocSane> RaveBrony: I swear to God, this actually happened.
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo MLP_Brovakiin
<killerpony7733> Wrek God i can't tell how happy i am for you streaming this
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: its even weirder when something happens to you irl that you dreamt of, and you dont remember about the dream until it happens. that happened to me a Lot
<Barbetos|AtWork> I speeel my DRINK!
<HoodyNinja> Well, I slept in and missed school
<DocSane> RaveBrony: At that moment, I realized I was dreaming and the fuzziness of thought you get when you dream just vanished.
<HoodyNinja> Hows everyone doing today?
<killerpony7733> Wrek Oh your having this problem
<DocSane> RaveBrony: I knew I was dreaming, but the reality of the dream seemed as real as waking life.
<killerpony7733> Wrek You NEED to get a driver mod and all to make this go away and run normally
<RaveBrony> DocSane: Haha :D
<killerpony7733> Wrek I can link you the solution
<Wrek> 05DO SUC HRGITH AWU
<Dark92Something> Top favorite = :) 2nd = :O then goes = :( and then = :D then = ;) and then goes = >_>.....favorite background pony is :P hooves down, and favorite Princess is Luna
<RaveBrony> Got love lucid dreams... but of course there are some tests you have to do before you start going all crazy :D
<killerpony7733> Wrek It's techinally a more complete thing it adds alot extra stuff to use as options but yeah brb then
<Dark92Something> FINALLY GOT ALL THE MANE 6
<DocSane> RaveBrony: I tried walkign around in the fake environment and managed to walk around the room a bit before I felt it all start slipping away as I began to wake up.
<Dark92Something> TWILY <3
<DocSane> RaveBrony: So, as I said, my lucid dream was very mundane and short-lived, but it was a true lucid dream.
<HoodyNinja> Its quiet during the day
<RaveBrony> DocSane: Still nice tho :D look up stuff to have them more!
<Wrek> 05killerpony7733: whats takign so long? :P
<RaveBrony> I pinch myself, haha
<KnifeH> The doctor is in!
<DocSane> RaveBrony: I've tried, but I rarely remember my dreams.
<RaveBrony> D:
<DocSane> DocSane: I sleep VERY deeply (Since I started using a CPAP a few years ago).
<KnifeH> I had a dream of scootaloo failing her exam and she became a knight of a chess game.
<KnifeH> I was like, wat
<KnifeH> It was an awesome dream.
<HoodyNinja> I dreamt I was on fire
<RaveBrony> ._.
<KnifeH> That's cause you're so hot~
*HoodyNinja takes his shirt off
<RaveBrony> Oh god :D
<KnifeH> .. that chest hair
<HoodyNinja> KnifeH: ;)
<HoodyNinja> gdi Im tired
<HoodyNinja> I blame bronystate
<DocSane> I think I'll cancel my cable and just watch this site from now on.
<MadSurge> HoodyNinja: best reason to be tired though :F
<Barbetos|AtWork> DocSane lol
<MadSurge> *:D
<HoodyNinja> MadSurge: True
<HoodyNinja> DocSane: Get sattelite, its great!
<HoodyNinja> The best part is is that you cant tell if im being sarcastic or not
<Barbetos|AtWork> Except when it rains and really cloudy!
<DocSane> HoodyNinja: Not for love or money. I live on the beach. The weather plays hell with sat TV around here.
<DocSane> HoodyNinja: Plus I get an excellent net connection from Comcast.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Techinical difficulties?
<HoodyNinja> DocSane: Comcast customer support is shit
<DocSane> HoodyNinja: Good thing I very, very rarely use it.
<HoodyNinja> Comcast in general is shit
<DocSane> HoodyNinja: It's Comcast or DSL here.
<HoodyNinja> but whatever, i dont supposed direct tv is any better
<DocSane> In other words, a 30/2 connection or a 3/768k connection.
<HoodyNinja> like i care, i hardly even use tv
<MadSurge> :O Old timey Deus Ex?
<MirrorImage> DocSane - what company is the DSL from?
<killerpony7733> MadSurge yeppers
<DocSane> I hardly watch TV, but I split the bill with my upstairs neighbor.
<Lil_B> and now for something completly different
<DocSane> MirrorImage: Verizon.
<MirrorImage> i think i'd try my luck more with the DSL than comcast
<Lil_B> A Larch
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: EYE SPEEL MAH DREENK
<DocSane> MirrorImage: I really have no complaints with Comcast. I used to have RCN, but they don't serve this town.
<MirrorImage> for long gaming sessions, though, comcast is rather inconsistent
<MirrorImage> i swear it would kick me off at least once every 30-60 minutes
<Dragonmatte> Hello everypony :3

<Dark_Horst> for corporation
<Barbetos|AtWork> First day on the job and stealing stuff from other offices.
<killerpony7733> Also a good thing to note the game changes in music themes hinting to the current situation of what's going on
<SirGanjalf> Unatco is not a corp.
<Dark_Horst> redecorate ALL the offices
<Everlasting_Joy> Barbetos|AtWork: Sounds like a job at a grocery store.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why is Wrek constantly taking plants with him?

<SirGanjalf> JC Dentroll
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Vivix> killerpony7733, truth
<Gold_Demona> Wrek is very talented. He can throw a trashcan without knocking it over or even making the lid come off. :P
<Gold_Demona> And it lands standing up. :D
<Vivix> I recently downloaded Goldeneye to N64, and found out why it's so extremely blocky. It was a whopping 4mb
<Moopy> so why does most everypony don't feel like themselfs here?
<Vivix> Whatnow?
<SirGanjalf> dat broken robot
<Vivix> To think those robots actually exist now
<Vivix> sortof-
<SirGanjalf> And they are smaller!
<Vivix> hehe yeaa
<Gold_Demona> What do you mean Moopy?
<Vivix> There was this football field nearby here who used lawmmower robots
<Vivix> and one of them crashed and ran away, and they had to chase it to turn it off
<Moopy> like how come you guys don't feel like yourselfs?
<Vivix> I feel like myself-
<Gold_Demona> I don't get what you mean by that
<Moopy> i know that but but most anypony
<Gold_Demona> Who said they didn't feel like themselves?
<Moopy> i did
<Jmo> >__>
<Moopy> i was asking though
<Gold_Demona> Um... Then it's because you're imagining it?
<Vivix> Is this related to a conversation further up?
<Gold_Demona> Cuz I have no idea what you're talking about. O_o
<Jmo> ^
<Vivix> me neither <,<
<Moopy> hmmm that explains everything
*Gold_Demona is still confused
*Vivix walks away slowly
<killerpony7733> Smart wrek is smart
<Moopy> wow
<Vivix> This game is so early 2000's cybery
<Vivix> you know, when PVC was cool and girls had pink dreads
<killerpony7733> Yep
<SirGanjalf> Well, he can't get no satisfaction.
<Gold_Demona> America is about throwing random crap at people. Accurate.
<SirGanjalf> E
<Gold_Demona> And eating cheeseburgers
<RoboGerbil> house of 1000 corpses
<SirGanjalf> So much BLOOD!
<Vivix> O wrek
<Gold_Demona> Are you painting the floor with the corpse?
<Gold_Demona> Wrek is making art! :D
<RoboGerbil> hes bleeding from his pe nis
<SirGanjalf> Gold_Demona: He makes art 'til someone dies. Like Joker!
<Gold_Demona> Moar water!
<Gold_Demona> That's a lot of soda.
<Moopy> Ok now your just being like duke nukem
<Gold_Demona> Take all the funyuns!
<Dark_Horst> dying seems to happen a lot
<SirGanjalf> Douche Ex, yay!

<killerpony7733> Sooo quiet
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Doctor Whooves and Assistant Collab with Doctor Whooves Adventure
<Gold_Demona> We're too busy watching the stream I guess
<Applejack2012> tries to revive chat
<SirGanjalf> JC has clearly lost it.
<killerpony7733> Pretty much
<killerpony7733> Yush this part <3
<alexxm> whats going on
<SirGanjalf> ^I have no idea!
<killerpony7733> You are seeing the godly mod known as the malkavian mod for DX1
<killerpony7733> Randomness incarnate
<killerpony7733> :3
<SirGanjalf> :D
<LyraTheGreat> HIIIII
<Kammerjunk> Easy to bribe?
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk pretty much~
<LyraTheGreat> I remember playing this :0
<killerpony7733> Same
<Kammerjunk> I don't even know what I'm listening to anymore.
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk it's full of wut and wat
<killerpony7733> Hehe
<Kammerjunk> It is.
<SirGanjalf> I don't understand too, JC.
<alexxm> er whats going on
<LyraTheGreat> Don't know how this relates to FIM :c
<killerpony7733> LyraTheGreat we aren't exactly ponies 24/7 ya know
<Kammerjunk> LyraTheGreat: You don't want to ask for ponie.
<Kammerjunk> ponies*
<LyraTheGreat> Not meaning to ask
<VenHur> This reminds me of that one game on the Gamecube...
<NotVordox> O.o
<VenHur> What's it called again...?
<Gold_Demona> LyraTheGreat: Usually the pony stuff is shown on Movie night and when the new episodes air on Hub
<killerpony7733> VenHur Not sure what you mean but this game is Deus ex 1
<NotVordox> O.o
<LyraTheGreat> I had a gamecube once, I gave it to my friend
<NotVordox> heh
<LyraTheGreat> And I don't have the Hub.
<NotVordox> XD Moskau!
<killerpony7733> Moskau!
<Gold_Demona> LyraTheHub: Neither do most of us here. :P
<Gold_Demona> LyraTheGreat*
<NotVordox> Oh! Immigrant song!
<Gold_Demona> lol that bad typo
<Kammerjunk> Moskau! Moskau! Deine Seele ist so groß! Nacht da ist der Teufel los!
<Kammerjunk> Ha ha ha ha ha! Hey!
<Kammerjunk> Nachts* goddammit
<Moopy> i wonder what the admin is doing right now?
<VenHur> Oh yeah, now I remember, this game is kind of like Ikaruga!
<LyraTheGreat> Youtube is my resource for Ponies, the Hub isn't in the UK
<killerpony7733> He's watching the video? along with any other mods maybe peeking in
<killerpony7733> It isn't that hard to figure out Moopy
<SirGanjalf> Aww did i missed the Moskau part?
<killerpony7733> SirGanjalf yeppers :<
<Applejack2012> The Hub is not in Denmark either so the livestream is my source
<Gold_Demona> LyraTheGreat: Which is why we come here. Mods stream Hub so we can all watch new episodes when they air.
<Moopy> He could be watching me in the chat right now to make sure i don't say anything rude or something bad i guess
<killerpony7733> Applejack2012 Yep pretty much
<NotVordox> Did he just mindfeck a robot...?
<LyraTheGreat> I'm new to this, so thanks for telling me that :L
<Applejack2012> its funnier to watch ponies on chat
<VenHur> Ikaruga is a Gamecube game similar to this.
<killerpony7733> LyraTheGreat how new?
<Gold_Demona> LyraTheGreat: And now you know, and knowing is half the battle! :D
<Applejack2012> mod asleep post ponies
<alexxm> the hub isn't in europe
<NotVordox> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<LyraTheGreat> I became pegasister 3 months ago, I found this site today :L
<NotVordox> Welcome, LyraTheGreat =3
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony
<Applejack2012> I became a Brony for a year ago
<Gold_Demona> Well, welcome to the heard, LyraTheGreat. =)
<Gold_Demona> herd*
<Applejack2012> welcome
<NotVordox> I became a brony 25 years ago
<NotVordox> :P
<Kammerjunk> Applejack2012: Yeah. I'd say the lack of the Hub here sucks, but I already have all the episodes in 720/1080p.
<LyraTheGreat> Season 3 is in October, I think. I might be wrong
<Kammerjunk> You people don't know how easy you have it. Being a brony back in my day in 1759 was tough, I tells you!
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Crystal Empire DVD Information Released!
<killerpony7733> LyraTheGreat I would say pegasister is a silly term to use cause brony works just as much females as it does with males
<Applejack2012> Me too NotVordox for 25 years ago
<Gold_Demona> There's been no official announcement on the season opener. =(
<Vordox> Not bad AppleDash :D
<killerpony7733> LyraTheGreat Oh and since you are new to this site. Have ye read the rules and FAQ?
<Kammerjunk> Ha. No one reads the bloody rules anymore.
<LyraTheGreat> Yup
<Kammerjunk> I stand corrected.
<LyraTheGreat> Half of it
<LyraTheGreat> :L
<Applejack2012> mr know it all lol
<killerpony7733> LyraTheGreat nice. Welp all there is to follow the rules and you'll enjoy being here :P
<LyraTheGreat> Okay!
<Vordox> THIS DIALOGUE IS SO BAD
<LyraTheGreat> I know right :O
<VenHur> EarthBound...damn fine good game.
<LyraTheGreat> Yup
<LyraTheGreat> I'll get an SNES soon, then I can get EarthBound :3
<Bronysith> VenHur: spoil and you will know a death very painful
<Bronysith> LyraTheGreat: one does not simply come across a copy of earthbound
<Bronysith> very rare game
<LyraTheGreat> Rly?

<AJIsAwesome> Just putting this out there (I never played any FF games), but why is this game so bad?
<RoboGerbil> in 8, you go into spaaaaccceee
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: play final fantasy 6 or 7 then 13 and you will see
<Bronysith> RoboGerbil: same in 7
<Bronysith> RoboGerbil: NO SPOILERS
<SafariMonkey> Well that didn't work. :P
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: I'll try to.
<RoboGerbil> how is that a spoiler?
<AJIsAwesome> DAT VOICE ACTING
<MLP_Brovakiin> I never really cared for the wholeFinal fantasy either :/
<Ember> lyro is now an character
<VenHur> Ness: Stop buzzing around my head!!
<Ember> lyra*
<SafariMonkey> Anyone here familiar with basic Mac OSX/Bash scripting?
<Thunder-Crescent> lyra has my attentiion not the stream
<VenHur> Ness: I mean, geesh, annoy Porky!
<alexxm> so final fantasy is doing real time battles now
<RoboGerbil> Rinoa is my favorite FF female
<Lil_B> AJIsAwesome (What I've heard) Really unlikable Characters (Emo's, Douches or Idiots or plain Annoying)
<Gold_Demona> AJIsAwesome: Compared to the older FF games, this game is really bad. The only thing this game has going for it is that the graphics are really pretty. =/
<Ember> DAMM ADD
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: THIS IS A GAME?!
<Lil_B> VenHur are you playing earthbound right niow?
<AJIsAwesome> Okay. Thanks, guys.
<VenHur> Lil_B: No actually...
<SafariMonkey> If you are, talk to ofna01, he needs your help
<RoboGerbil> almost as many movies as xenosaga
<Ember> lol chicken
<alexxm> chocobo
<Bronysith> LIGHTNING IS KRISTEN STEWART
<Ember> a what?
<Bronysith> she has no emotion whatsoever
<Thunder-Crescent> does anyone know when MLP FIM season 3 starts
<Bronysith> Thunder-Crescent: nope
<Ember> december
<Lil_B> This year... as far as I know
<Applejack2012> its all secrets and lies
<RoboGerbil> but at least you get some input in this... xenosaga you watch 45 min of movie before you can do anything
<Lil_B> but not even that I can confirm, sorry :/
<Thunder-Crescent> oh well worth a shot
<AJIsAwesome> That's weird, what's with the gameplay mechanics?
<Unnr> The general problem with Final Fantasy XIII in a nutshell. When fans have to defend the game by saying "It gets better after the first 24 hours of play time"
<Dark_Horst> final fantasy
<alexxm> how many cut scenes does this have
<Dark_Horst> ?
<Ember> alezzm: whats a chocobo?
<AJIsAwesome> Is this some new kind of battle system?
<Ember> alexxm*
<Gold_Demona> I miss the turn-based menu-select battle system. What was so wrong with that system?
<Dark_Horst> Ember: flightless bird used for riding
<Unnr> AJIsAwesome: Yep, its more of an extention of the Final Fantasy XII auto-battle system
<alexxm> Ember that little chicken thing that was on the screen
<twilight_sprinkle> ff7:cc was hella fun from the first minute and kept getting better :P
<AJIsAwesome> Unnr: Okay.
<Dark_Horst> that'S a TINY chocobo
<Thunder-Crescent> the only SOLIDER is shinra
<Gold_Demona> BABY chocobo
<Gold_Demona> Ish a chicobo in fact
<Petrified_Discord> Chocobo must go through one HELL of a growth spurt
<Ember> i say cloud, because thats the only name i know xD
<RoboGerbil> twilight_sprinkle: yeh but what brough ff7 down was the part where you had to dress in drag just to advance...
<VenHur> Nooo, Buzz Buzz, you only lived for 9 mintues!
<alexxm> Ember you see that bird that guy was holding thats a chocobi
<AJIsAwesome> I saw JonTron do a video on this game, but it really wasn't in-depth.
<Sumica> 00,10every ff has had active time battle
<Bronysith> why does this game even need a camera? the only direction is FORWARD
<Sumica> 00,10it's was at one point an option
<Moopy> hello there sumica sup dude
<Bronysith> BEST FF character is TERRA
<Gold_Demona> RoboGerbil: I thought that part was funny. Expecially if you go to the trouble to make it so Don Cornero picks Cloud. :P
<Sumica> 00,10Sup
<twilight_sprinkle> RoboGerbil: idk i never actually played ff7, only ff7:c

<Moopy> hows it going?
<twilight_sprinkle> *cc
<Lil_B> AJIsAwesome As far as I know, you give everyone a role (like wizard, warrior or similar) before the fights and in battle, they pertty much just fight on their own while you press the attack button :/ I really would reccomend watching Spoonys Videos about it for In-Deph hilarious ranting on the game XD
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Litwick
<Petrified_Discord> It's difficult for people to say why they don't like FFXIII. I have yet to hear a good, simple explanation :P
<Barbetos|AtWork> I don't remember the first Final Fantasy having it.
<Thunder-Crescent> zack fair ftw
<Ember> no seriously, the only anmes i know are from a movie...
<Ember> names*
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: Okay.
<twilight_sprinkle> Thunder-Crescent: ikr
<Bronysith> Petrified_Discord: how about shit gameplay and it is just a movie
<twilight_sprinkle> Thunder-Crescent: best character
<Bronysith> Petrified_Discord: horrible story
<Moopy> i thought you were still asleep though sumica
<Litwick> Final hallway 13?
<Bronysith> Petrified_Discord: god awful characters
<Unnr> Petrified_Discord: In essence, linearity.
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Wait a minute, you can ONLY go forward? :O
<Sumica> 00,10nah just have not been chating
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: EXACTLY
<Saturn> 08,01sumica!
<Moopy> oh cool
<Sumica> 00,10Sup Saturn
<Petrified_Discord> That's just it. So many different reasons! XD
<Lil_B> Petrified_Discord unlikeable/unreleatable characters and repetitive Combat
<RoboGerbil> also ff7 had way too much grinding toward the end... knights of the round, and emerald/ruby weapon
<AJIsAwesome> Well that doesn't make any sense.......:S
<Litwick> I think JonTron's "Final Hallway" video describes this game PERFECTLY
<SafariMonkey> Who's streaming?
<Unnr> Plot is fairly standard, maps are (mostly) straight lines, and the battle system lacks nuance, particularly early on in the game. At least, that seems to be the general concensus
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: Caramel.
<Petrified_Discord> Litwick: Hey...try and go left.
<Saturn> 08,01i has a celestia blind bag!
<Ember> well
<Gold_Demona> RoboGerbil: emerald/ruby were optional tho.
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Nice.
<SafariMonkey> Thanks AJIsAwesome
<Ember> i has a bannana bag
<Unnr> Lucky!
<Litwick> Petrified_Discord: ...I cant go left.
<Sumica> 00,10funny thing is RoboGerbil, the weapons were not in the orignal version of FF7
<Petrified_Discord> Litwick: Hey...try and go right.
<Barbetos|AtWork> His voice is different all of a sudden
<Sumica> 00,10they were added for the US version
<Lil_B> Petrified_Discord and yeah, way to linear, you litteraly walk down corridors... that's how maps are designed...
<Litwick> Petrified_Discord: ... I cant go right.
<Petrified_Discord> Litwick: Hey...try and play the game.
<AJIsAwesome> Just putting this out there, but how was only going forward a good decision for this game? :S
<RoboGerbil> i beat emerald weapon once, but not ruby.. ever
<Barbetos|AtWork> Sumica where did you hear about that?
<Litwick> Petrified_Discord: I thought I was... but I was using the wrong controller the whole time.
<Ember> guys, i know a game
<Applejack2012> me jelly saturn
<Unnr> AJIsAwesome: linear straight maps are becomming more standard with the rise of the FPS industry.
<Bronysith> RoboGerbil: opposite for me
<Gold_Demona> RoboGerbil: I made it a point to beat both weapons at least once just for the bragging rights, but otherwise they're not worth fighting.
<Sumica> 00,10long time ago dont recall the site any more
<Litwick> Petrified_Discord: The game's playing itself Jon. THE GAME'S JUST PLAYING ITSELF JON! THE GAME'S JSUT PLAYING ITSELF JON!
<AJIsAwesome> Unnr: Okay.
<Petrified_Discord> Litwick: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<twilight_sprinkle> Litwick: thats what i was thinking :D
<Lil_B> Litwick JOHN!!! JoHN JOHN!!! AAAAHHHHHHH
<Barbetos|AtWork> And by weapons you mean the utlimate weapons right?
<Ember> the object to your left is the only thing that wil stop the killer from killing you, what is it?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Bronysith> so true
<Bronysith> final hallway 13 is god awful game
<Unnr> If you ever want to do something amusing, try actually mapping out a standard plot-railed FPS map, and trying to figure out how it would work IRL
<Bronysith> Ember: my m16
<twilight_sprinkle> still, ff7:cc was pretty linear too but the combat system was fun, and the story was amazing
<Discord> Hello, meow.
<Sumica> 00,10ruby, saphire, ultmate, they were only ever seen in the cutscenes
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: IKR
<SafariMonkey> Ember: An old tower pc
<Sumica> 00,10there were not any kind of side boss
<Discord> meow, right.
<Petrified_Discord> Ember: ...A door. I leave. XD
<alexxm> how are things Discord
<SafariMonkey> Ember: Hack it to death!
<Litwick> at least this game's not as bad as Stairfax Temperatures
<Lil_B> today I decided to begin reading homestuck.... I think I'm somewhere on picture/page 20 or so
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: A secret, I actually hate FFVII
<Discord> Eh, good, but the statue's getting a bit dusty.
<Ember> i has a piano
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: why?
<SafariMonkey> Hey Sonny
<Dark_Horst> dont know if i've seen enough to judge yet, but this game looks kinda redundant
<Sonny> Hey everypony
<Applejack2012> hi
<Ember> play him to sleep!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Huh. You think it would of been the other way around. Japan getting the extra bosses and us not.
<Sonny> Hey SafariMonkey :)
<Discord> also I made a theme
<Petrified_Discord> Discord: Who are you calling dusty? :[
<alexxm> how are things Sonny
<Sonny> good alexxm
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: didn't like the characters, the story was boring, and the combat system was only so-so
<Lil_B> hi Sonny :)
<Discord> No one
<MLP_Brovakiin> ++frfgtr
<Discord> https://www.mychrometheme.com/t/f129kq8lqc12p8mo5yzvr1op7 meow, now look at my theme :c
<SafariMonkey> Oh soz Sonny I gotta go
<Ember> well discord, im calling your argument...
<MLP_Brovakiin> fuiouuii
<Ember> rock solid
<Gold_Demona> Unnr: That's more or less how I feel about 8 and 12
<Sonny> I'm just logging in to inform you that tonight I wont be at my dad's pc so I wont be on for long ;)
<Discord> it's worst pony
<Discord> jk.
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: i havent played ff7, i only played ff7:cc
<Vordox> OMG?!
<Vordox> QUALITY GAME ON STREAM!?
<Discord> We all know I hate Twilight, lol.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Sorry, my cat was trampling my keyboard :$
<Vordox> Who is playing FFXIII!?
<Lil_B> the sirened oin our village are going off ôo
<VenHur> Oh, this guy...he's funny for the first few times, but then got mildly annoying...
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: Compare it to FFVI or even FF IX, its a fairly meh game.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Huh? Rebels!
<Vordox> VenHur: You completed the game?
<Ember> new element discoverd
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: are you implying fallout and deus ex arent quality?
<Ember> spuprise
<Ember> suprise*
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Depends on what "quality" is
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: crisis core or ff7?
<VenHur> Vordox: No, I just watched Chuggaa's videos...
<VenHur> But I MIGHT played the game sometime..
<Vordox> VenHur: I played FFXIII
<Vordox> It's DAMN good
<Vordox> Just fans being pricks and spoiled
<Saturn> 08,01oh how delightful, now my trousers also smell of cat piss
<Vordox> And I'm eagerly waiting for the third installment =3
<Wormwood> Discord, what do you mean you hate Twilight? ;~;
<Discord> Well...SHE TURNED ME TO STONE FOR FIRST :C
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: Don't own a PSP so haven't played crisis core, nor do I really want to.
<Vordox> Discord: Minor onconvinience?
<Dark_Horst> did she just try to dump the black gy?
<Saturn> 08,01i swear, if i was there tonight, we'd be having roast cat for dinner
<Vordox> You played Wrek?
<Discord> ...no, she did it on purpose :'(
<Discord> and she made me sad :(
<Saturn> 08,01heh, we'd be eating pussy...
<Wormwood> Discord, in all fairness you did have it coming.
<BladedWings> Saturn: :D
<Discord> And I'm installing Gotham Imposters on steam :(
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: in crisis core the combat system is different and i loved the story and the characters were amazing, adn the music, and the atmosphere, it was great
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Oh you! :P
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: dohohohohohoh
<Sonny> Discord: wasn't it celestia who turned you into stone first and afther that the main 6 characters of mlp fim?
<Unnr> Saturn: That was a horrible double entendre. Good Job!
<Lil_B> Saturn :| I don't know if I had to expect this
<Discord> No I didn't I was just sittign there ruling over my kingdom, but nooo, she had to ruin it.
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: the characters were especially great
<Discord> Yeah.
<alexxm> well the musics good
<Lil_B> yes, "Planetary Annihilation" has reached 1,5mil Pledged, even more planet types :)
<Sonny> <_<
<Sonny> >_>
<Discord> and also lie
<Ember> Sonny, are you lying?
<Discord> (lie)
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: oh, trust me, it was worse for my boyfriend. i was making pussy jokes all week
<Discord> (liar)
<Discord> I forgot how to :c
*alexxm kidnaps Discord
<Vordox> Good luck =P
<Sonny> I was actually sleeping in my overly comftrable bed just now
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, i was making lots of terrible puns
<Discord> :c get off me
<Unnr> Saturn: This is a suprise... how?
<Unnr> :p
<Vordox> (PS: The game actually becomes hard at around 10 hours in)
<Sonny> it's so sooft /)^3^(\
<BladedWings> Saturn: did he find them punny?
<Lil_B> Saturn I <3 horrible puns and jokes XD
<Ember> alexxm, how you do that?
<Lil_B> especially the never ending kind of puns
<alexxm> Ember i don't know
<Saturn> 08,01his name is Koen, and i made one about "silly koen implants" before i left
<Vordox> Wrek is playing, or Sumica? Or prince-dari ? or Saturn ?
<Sonny> I actually have ffxIII for ps3
<Unnr> =.(\
<Sonny> But I can't get past one bit
<Caramel> 2,14 yeah, hard because they beef up all the monsters and expect you to use strategies they never teach you
<Vordox> Caramel: Oh so Caramel is playing? =3
<Sonny> ikr Caramel
<Obsidian> Hey guys
<Sonny> hey Obsidian
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Obsidian
<AJIsAwesome> Obsidian: Hi! :)
<Lil_B> hia Obsidian :)
<alexxm> how are things Obsidian
<BladedWings> hi Obsidian
<Sonny> first! /)^3^(\
<Obsidian> alexxm: Okay so far
<Vordox> Caramel: Oh they teach you, you just get TOO used to the lower level difficulty
<Lil_B> btw Vordox I finished the Beanbag :)
<Applejack2012> good evening!§
<Sonny> haha yeah ikr Vordox
<Sonny> :p
<Discord> n_n I've almost completed Sonic Generations
<Caramel> 2,14 really? they teach you that the only way to kill the behemoths is to chain attack into the air so they never 1 hit kill you?
<Lil_B> good evening Applejack2012
<Caramel> 2,14 because I must have missed that tutorial
<Vordox> Lil_B: Not bad =3
<Vordox> Caramel: That difficulty spike :P
<Sonny> Hey everpony?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> FF 13 ?
<Lil_B> Vordox I haven't even shows it yet :|
<Obsidian> Caramel is playing FFXIII?
<Sonny> Has there been any epic drawing recently that I missed out on?
<Dark_Horst> GOD, those two are jaüanese
<Discord> but I can't get past that one last boss :c
<Dark_Horst> *japanese
<Bronysith> TERRA and LAGUNA are best final fantasy characters
<Vordox> Lil_B: You want me to critic?
<Vordox> Oh hai Snow
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: and zach
<RoboGerbil> sucky motto
<AJIsAwesome> Discord: Which one?
<Sonny> Has there been any epic drawing recently that I missed out on?
<Discord> Time Eater
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: spin offs dont count
<Lil_B> Vordox if it's ok for you, you know I never want to distract someone from something if he doesn't want to
<AJIsAwesome> Discord: Oh........okay.
<Vordox> I'm just watching stream, Eagerly awaiting for Caramel to probably suprise me. Probably
<Discord> Nora, attaboy even though I'm a girl.
<Dark_Horst> his boots sound liek a basketbalö
<Bronysith> wait
<Caramel> 2,14 surprise you with what?
<Sonny> Has there been any epic drawing recently that I missed out on? AJIsAwesome SafariMonkey?
<Bronysith> seth green, im sure i heard him
<Vordox> Caramel: Quality gaming from your side =3
<Dark_Horst> fucking umlauts, what do you want from me tonight
<RoboGerbil> that guns bigger than she is
<AJIsAwesome> Discord: Use Sonic to destroy the debris and then boost into him. Also make sure to slow down and boost into rings.
<Caramel> 2,14 quality ey? Then I'd better stop playing FF13 kekekekekeke
<AJIsAwesome> Sonny: Not really.
<Vordox> Caramel: Oh yo
<Vordox> you*
<Ember> caramel just counter trolled discord
<Ember> LIKE A BAWS!
<Sonny> AJIsAwesome: alrite' thanks
<Dark_Horst> she be dancing
<Vordox> Dat instant own
<Vordox> I love games that value you for your combats.
<Vordox> Caramel: ever played Tales of? =3
<Bronysith> real heroes dont need plans?
<twilight_sprinkle> reeeaaal heroes dont have brains!
<Dark_Horst> famous final words
<Ember> real hero's do this
<Vordox> Ember: Real heros goes up and hits
<Ember> LEEEEEEEEEEROY JEEEEEENKINS!!
<Bronysith> why the fuck do they have a rating system in a final fantasy game?
<Bronysith> WTF
<Vordox> Bronysith: Cause youshould get rated for your fights
<Caramel> 2,14 because the game is full of fail
<Dark_Horst> real heroes save a nuclear wasteland all on their own without sleeping a single night
<Bronysith> Caramel: thank you!
<Caramel> 2,14 and, funny enough, these battles don't even matter
<twilight_sprinkle> who doesnt like getting stars??
<Caramel> 2,14 you don't even get exp until later
<Bronysith> nice music though
<Bronysith> well, considering it is final fantasy, good music is a requirement
<Vordox> Caramel: So faster killings the better
<alexxm> then why have them
<Ember> real heros fight like men and put up fists
<Ember> (hidden reference there)
<Vordox> Bronysith: FFXIII had the better music, compared to some of FFXIII-2
<twilight_sprinkle> did Uematsu do the music in this one?
<Dark_Horst> then they proceed to die of radiation, get revived and free some kroe wastelabd
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: No
<Dark_Horst> *more
<twilight_sprinkle> mkay
<Sonny> It took me about 40 hours to get to the part where it get's nearly impossible while playing FFxii
<Caramel> 2,14 Uematsu hasn't done FF since X
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle Masachi Himazou mostly
<twilight_sprinkle> which is what the last good one is, i hear :P
<Kencolt> Caramel: Actually, he did a lot for FFXI Online.
<Gold_Demona> twilight-sprinkle: No, I'm pretty sure he stopped doing Final Fantasy music after 10
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> the battles in this FF were kind of easy
<twilight_sprinkle> what if...Uematsu is the only reason ff was good :O
<Vordox> Sonny: I loved FFXII<3
<Caramel> 2,14 FF online doesn't exist and should never be mentioned
<Vordox> Yeah sure, it had flaws, but still enjoyable
<Dark_Horst> Caramel: that bad? never played any ff
<Vordox> FFXI....? <.<
<Caramel> 2,14 also...fail at a game that requires you to grind farm, yet limits how much you can farm in segments
<Ember> FF online? whats that? 6_9
<AJIsAwesome> OH, that was the worst FF game ever.
<twilight_sprinkle> i saw the ad for ff online, and now that i think about it, i havent heard a thing about it since then
<AJIsAwesome> At least that's what I heard.
<Vordox> Caramel: Sad truth of streamlined games. :(
<Kencolt> Caramel: Hey-- I used to LOVE that game, my first MMO. Well, I loved it until it got so you waited 6 hours for a party...
<Gold_Demona> Ember: FFXI. It was an MMO
<Obsidian> Hey look cannon fodder
<Gold_Demona> And isn't FFIV supposed to also be an MMO?
<twilight_sprinkle> owait, or am i thinking about ff14
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: Still is. Mostly Japanese playing now, it's US presence is pretty dead.
<Kandarihu> So, what's this on the stream?
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: FFXIV yeah, FAIL of a FF
<Kandarihu> Is this one of those newer FF games?
<Vordox> MOMS ARE BADARSE
<Obsidian> Kandarihu: FF XIII
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: After how badly FFXI did, I'm not surprised.
<Sonny> well I have to go now
<alexxm> just ask ellen ripley
<Sonny> ciao
<Kandarihu> Ah, so THIS is FFXIII
<Ember> well, ive seen other kinds of moms
<Obsidian> Bye Sonny
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah, give the gun to the little girl
<Sonny> ;)
<Vordox> BAD GIRL
<Ember> running away from spiders
<Dark_Horst> yes, give the assault rifle to the little girl
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: A time of war :P
<Vordox> ALL UNITED
<Vordox> WE WILL LIVE
<Dark_Horst> motivational speach was not very effective
<twilight_sprinkle> and then the little girl shot them all in the back as a joke
<Obsidian> ANd then they all die of friendly fire
<Ember> give 4 year old childeren guns! good idea!
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: Actually, it did pretty well. For a fw years, it was big for the MMO market. But the US contingent eventually moved to WoW, mostly, because of accessability and the fact that you no longer would need a party of 6 to level in it.
<Bronysith> VANILLE YOU SUCK
<Dark_Horst> and then the little girl tripped and splattered her brains over all of the other kids
*Vordox slaps Bronysith
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Like Starship Troopers?
<Bronysith> Vordox: she and tidus are worst final fantasy characters
<Ember> Vordox how do you do that?
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: Goes to show how much I paid attention. =/
<twilight_sprinkle> music is repetetive too
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: something like that
<twilight_sprinkle> *repetitive
<Caramel> 2,14 at least Tidus was supposed to be annoying
<Gold_Demona> Ember: /me
<Caramel> 2,14 Vanille is just something you want to throw down a meat grinder
<Dark_Horst> who is vanille?
<Bronysith> Caramel: what do you think of Terra?
<Vordox> Caramel: Give her time... she's a bitch nonetheless
<Obsidian> Ember: type /me then what you want to say
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: I had a Mithra, had so much fun with her-- eventually capper her as a Monk. Monk was easy and fun. You LITERALLY just walked up to things and started hitting them.
<twilight_sprinkle> vanille is the girl rite? i thought she was cute :3
<Caramel> 2,14 bitch, don't be hating Terra
<twilight_sprinkle> the one with the orange hair
<Lil_B> well, the Fact that Tidus was supposed to be annoying doesn't make it better to have him around -.-
<twilight_sprinkle> or was it pink
<Bronysith> Caramel: im not, she is best character
<Vordox> Bronysith: Vanille MAY not be the best FF character, I agree. But she deserves not that much hate =P Just medium amount of it
<Bronysith> laguna and cloud are my second favs
<Caramel> 2,14 Lil_B: at least the game didn't FORCE YOU TO PLAY AS HIM -_-
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: My husband and I played FFXI for a little bit, but we got bored of it really quick cuz there's not a lot to do.
<Kandarihu> I played a little bit of FFVI this morning.
<Vordox> Bronysith: And SERIOUSLY, Tidus is worst char? XD
<Lil_B> Caramel still... the laughing scene... and his generall stupidity in Cutscenes >.<
<Ember> i should try a ff game i guess
<Flyboy> what is this then?
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: You may have just hit a poor server-- I always found plenty to do for a few years. Then it started to die for US players...
<Vordox> OY Bronysith !
<alexxm> because of course gangsta style always works
<Kandarihu> Flyboy, FF 13
<Ember> problem is, i only have a wii and a ds at home...
<Flyboy> oh god... a jrpg...
<Flyboy> well i'm outta here
<Vordox> IF THERE WAS NO Tidus, there would be no Balthier, I'm certain of it :P
<Dark_Horst> are those stnadart military issue?
<twilight_sprinkle> hm, that thing seems to have a cool design
<Ember> wich one do you guys reccomend?
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: My husband and I never play with strangers, and they didn't exactly have much content for soloers.
<Bronysith> Vordox: what? i said vanille is worst character
<Vordox> Cause FFX created the style of FFXII
<Vordox> Bronysith: Yeah but don't hate THAT much of Tidus :P
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: I see. Well, I just made friends in game. Worked for me.
<Bronysith> Vordox: tidus is bad, but he is not the worst character
<Bronysith> owait
<Bronysith> AURON is also a good character
<Dark_Horst> giant military batle mech thing? PUNCH IT!
<Vordox> Bronysith: Rikku?
<Bronysith> Vordox: that too, tara strong <3
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: We kind of developed that attitude from playing Everquest. Too many stupid people on the internet, so we just avoid everybody. =/
<Vordox> Bronysith: Yep, gave millions of children/adolescent males boners :P
<Ember> we got trouble! you dont say?
<Vordox> BAD ARSE MOMS
<twilight_sprinkle> ded
<Kandarihu> Tough, but not invincible.
<Vordox> BAD ARSE MOMS Are also....dead..
<Dark_Horst> not so tough now, eh?
<Ember> awkward pose
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: Never played EQ... FFXI was my first and I played it on the PS2 and then the Xbox 360. (FFXI looked llike crap on the PC, but then the PC version was literally an afterthought.)
<Dark_Horst> SHE ISNT EVEN HURT!
<twilight_sprinkle> weeeeee
<Dark_Horst> NOTHING HIT HER! NO INJURIES!
<Vordox> WE ALL STAND Uni...ted..?
<Vordox> Well feck
<Vordox> Perhaps not THAT united.
<twilight_sprinkle> maybe shock wave?
<Ember> living life on the edge
<Kandarihu> Dark_Horst, she was too close to the explosion.
<Dark_Horst> still no injuries
<Lil_B> I hope I get the new WLan Stick soon, I wanna see FFXIII getting streamed :)
<Vordox> She's...dead...
<Kandarihu> She shielded that other guy.
<twilight_sprinkle> i cant hold on....we need to have a death to make the story sadder and more immersing!
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: Yeah, we had the PC versions, and I was not happy with the limited graphics capabilities on it. =(
<alexxm> ded
<Dark_Horst> yes, but STILL NO INJURIES
<Lil_B> btw, any more news on FF13-Versus?
<Ember> and im freeeeeee
<Ember> free falling!
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Dead before being dropped
<twilight_sprinkle> and then everyone died. The End
<Caramel> 2,14 FORCED EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT ON PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW NOR CARE ABOUT
<Ember> bitch slap
<Vordox> Caramel: I HAVE A MOTHER! I CARE!
<Vordox> Caramel: YOU HATE YOUR MOM?!
<Ember> tough choise
<Ember> to save, or not to save
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: You could improve the graphics- it took registry tweaking. Me, I stuck with the consoles. Besides, it was designed with a controller and a USB keyboard in mind. And the keyboard was really for chat.
<Kandarihu> I don't even know that mother's name. But it was practically a worf effect there.
<Lil_B> Caramel quality stroy Telling. 5 STARTS, A+, 4 Stars!!!!
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: Well, we only have 1 PS2, and it has no internet capabilities.
<Vordox> The thing is.
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: And we have no xbox. :P
<Vordox> There's CRAPTON of story in this
<Ember> you dont know what the goverment gets away with
<Vordox> It just starts WITHOUT and introduction ><
<Caramel> 2,14 there's a crap ton of information, not story
<Caramel> 2,14 piling on tons of info is not a story
<Bronysith> LIGHTING IS PLAYED BY KRISTEN STEWART
<Vordox> Caramel: Depends. :P Skyrim is the same
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: You also needed the HDD for the PS2. I got both. There's a certain pleasure to playing a MMORPG leaning back on your comfy sofa and chucking down a beer. (As opposed to now sitting at my PS and still chucking down a beer."
<Ember> MECH INC
<AJIsAwesome> She seems so........lifeless and dull. :S
<Caramel> 2,14 >implying Skyrim has much of a story
<Vordox> Caramel: Side stories = Rely on info
<Ember> AJIsAwesome: thats called emotionless
<Bronysith> Caramel: shit story sums up to, "you are chosen one, slay this dragon" stupid
<Kandarihu> Well, it's exposition.
<Dark_Horst> yeah, but the thing is, you dont play bethesda games for story
<Bronysith> Caramel: stupid story that is
<Dark_Horst> you never did
<Vordox> AJIsAwesome: Not everyone is all happy happy =P
<twilight_sprinkle> theres the war going on in skyrim
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: Yeah, I can see where that'd be more enjoyable. I've never played an MMO on anything other than a PC. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> and you make your own story
<Obsidian> THe only thing I like about this game are some of the enemy designs as well as the designs of the summons
<Dark_Horst> the story in every bethesda game is COMPLETELY SECONDARY
<Unnr> Caramel: >implying any bethesda game has a story
<Ember> oh i know her problem
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: And so far in FFXIII you have seen what? Happy land Festival? :P
<Lil_B> oh yeah, Spony made a V-Log when he firast played FF13... he was really mad about how the Story is not told, but mostly only accesable via Textbooks. ... "Here, this new Area, I could give you some history about it, but you know... here is a book about it..."
<AJIsAwesome> Ember: I know, it's just that she's not really memorable.
<Ember> she hasnt seen the magic of friendship :D
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: and if you are a nord, get shot once in the k nee and you have to give up on life
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: that joke is still horrible and you should still feel horrible
<Vordox> Bronysith: That joke is beyond dead...
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: I'm just saying that I can't see her as a memorable character.
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: And I've played a handful of MMOs of varying quality
<Kandarihu> You know one game I have a problem with storywise? Custom Robo Battle Revolution. It basically waited until the last possible moment to explain the foundations of the world setting.
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: Except for WoW, oddly enough
<Dark_Horst> how the fuck did he survive
<Bronysith> LIGHTNING YOU SHOW NO EMOTION
<Vordox> AJIsAwesome: Well...
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: it was in the script
<Vordox> AJIsAwesome: You'll know once you see life from the other way of every other perspective :P
<Kandarihu> And the whole backstory was told in a MASSIVE infodump that gave players multiple quicksaves through it all.
<Obsidian> oh god Hope
<Bronysith> DIE DIE VANILEE DIE
<Vordox> <.<
<Vordox> VANILLE
<Gold_Demona> It's Aerith and Rikku's lovechild!
<Dark_Horst> oh jesus, she alrewady looks annoyunbg
<Ember> i guess its pretty hard, to act emotionless as VA
<Vordox> Gold_Demona: ...That's...a really unusual observation
<twilight_sprinkle> that kid looks like cloud, only less emo..yet
<Gold_Demona> Vordox: :D
<twilight_sprinkle> *so far
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: "Yet" :D
<Metronome> Kingdom heart?
<Metronome> nvm
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Just wait, you'll cringe at ONE certain scene, perhaps Caramel knows which :D
<Ember> wait, i know that name, cloud i mena
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: NO, dont you dare compare hope to cloud, cloud is much better in every way
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: cloud is gaaay
<Obsidian> twilight_sprinkle: Oh just wait, he gets worse
<p4ngya> im wondering if this story really makes any sense in japanese
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: and pointlessly emo
<Caramel> 2,14 god, don't get me started
<Ember> i know him from a movie
<Kandarihu> Is this the beginning of the game moreorless?
<Vordox> Caramel: Where he "Grows" :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: when is the scene?
<AJIsAwesome> Caramel: Is it coming up soon?
<Caramel> 2,14 this game makes Cloud look like a motivational speaker
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Who knows. :P
<Vordox> Caramel: LOLOLOLOL!
<twilight_sprinkle> Caramel: hahahahaha XD
<Gold_Demona> twilight-sprinkle: Cloud CAN be gay, if you play the game right.
<Dark_Horst> what the fuck idiot?
<Lil_B> Caramel good one XD
<Vordox> Gold_Demona: No
<Dark_Horst> ...WHAT THE FUCK PHYSICS
<Obsidian> Well that was convinient
<Bronysith> Caramel: terra is still best final fantasy character, i still like cloud, but laguna is just so....laguna
<twilight_sprinkle> Gold_Demona: oh yeah, the dating bit :D
