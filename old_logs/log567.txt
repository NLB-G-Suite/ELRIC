<Quick_Thinker> walking dead the episode 1 or 2?
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: most likely 1
<Dken2021> SlurryMoon the game that's very atmospheric?
<Shizuka> 13game?
*DiddlyDerpy does not recognize Dear Esther
<SlurryMoon> 3yeah
<Shizuka> 13can you call dear esther a game? it is more like a text adventure
<Shizuka> 13played over 60s dialup
<otakon> SlurryMoon: I heard it's more of a interactive movie than anything else. Hell, heavy rain has more "game" in it.
<Shizuka> 13at 6 baud
<Bronysith> http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitbangerlabs/remee-the-rem-enhancing-lucid-dreaming-mask FUCK YES
<Jspang1> I WORSHIPPED CHURCH WAY BEFORE IT WAS COOL TO WORSHIP HIM

<Pudge> so hey, do you need a good computer to run dear esther?
<otakon> Bronysith: it won't work for me....I don't dream anymore.
<Pudge> because I was thinking about buying it
<lunac1> Ultima 1 for me purely for the blacksmith spaceshuttle :)
<otakon> RaveBrony: but that is it! It just looks good.
<OtakuTom> I'm trying to buy a Minecraft gift code for a friend of mine, but when I go through the payment page, I get a message stating that they cannot currently accept registrations from Illinois...
<Bronysith> otakon: but it lets your brain know you are dreaming.
<Bronysith> otakon: so it will work

<AttacktheAndalite> Hello, Alchemist
<lunac1> So no player interaction/gameplay just a narrative....
<Darf14> I hear things, but is anything suppose to happen on the screen?
<Vordox> Inb4 Slurry gets tired of the game :P
<Darf14> oh there we go :)
<Shizuka> 13myst minus myst
<Alchemist> I can see a "dear esther" menu
<lunac1> Vordox I'm tired of it from it;s description
<AttacktheAndalite> I can see the buffer channel
<Pudge> anypony know if you need a good computer to run this game?
<Darf14> ...or not :(
<Shizuka> 13slurry should suddenly yell in a microphone to wake ponies up :3
<Bronysith> Shizuka: is myst one of your fav games or something?
<Shizuka> 13it was only my first real game
<Shizuka> 13riven that is
<cratorkid> Pudge you realy just need to be able to run hl2
<Pudge> which i cant
<Pudge> chugs on mine
<Bronysith> Shizuka: nice. my first game was super mario 64 i think
<DiddlyDerpy> Bronysith: same here
<Shizuka> 13never had a console
<lunac1> Batman Arkham Asylum was mi
<Alchemist> its 5:25 am here. I couldnt sleep all night and eventually decided to get up...
<lunac1> ne
<Pudge> my first game ever was donkey kong country
<Shizuka> 13played a 360 once... hated it
<Polydunami> Did you say something, Shizuka? http://garfieldminusgarfield.net/post/145372821 :3
<AttacktheAndalite> First game was Spyro the Dragon
<Cypresswolf> Shizuka: I think I broke my Uru game - got through Teledahn, teleported into the room with the 4 pillars - Relto book shows a grey void, is that normal?
<Shizuka> 13Cypresswolf: jump through the middle
<lunac1> PC gamers are so abused by the induxtry
<Bronysith> Shizuka: well i loved my nintendo 64. only recently have i discovered the wonders of PC gaming
<AttacktheAndalite> Is it buffereing for anyone here?
<Darf14> My first game was Super Mario World
<Dken2021> ^
<Cypresswolf> Shizuka: game crashed when I did O_o
<Shizuka> 13might crash cause the bahro caves are notoriously crashy
<Shizuka> 13but as long as you grabbed or returned the pillar before you went, you're fine
<fluttercry> 05,15Dear Esther?
<Shizuka> 13that's a separate action which you'll catch when you log back in
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03dem crashy caves~
<lunac1> so this game has no player interaction or choice making... how is this a game?
<SlurryMoon> 3huh, do any of you see anything on the screen?
<DiddlyDerpy> SlurryMoon: only blinks of movement, not much else
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SlurryMoon streaming?
<ponibas> lol, i just lost connection to steam network..
<fluttercry> 05,15so...it's a visual novel?
<Bronysith> SlurryMoon: i see your special folder
<otakon> I see buffer
<AttacktheAndalite> SlurryMoon: I just got something on the screen, no sound thoughh.
<ponibas> that a hard crashy game tehre :p
<Polydunami> I see a strange wisp... it keeps going around and around and around...
<Polydunami> And around
<otakon> SlurryMoon: this is not a stream friendly game
<lunac1> fluttercry from what I can see yes
<otakon> Polydunami: lol
<Shizuka> 13source usually isn't
<Darf14> yay
<Shizuka> 13takes some luck to get source to stream well
<cratorkid> yay
<AttacktheAndalite> And I just got buffer
*Nittany_Discord 11,01sticks a stick in SlurryMoon and stirs him slowly.
<Shizuka> 13and since dear esther is haxing source engine to pieces to get its pretty visuals, probably heavier than usual
<Polydunami> D
<ponibas> wth.. dat ninja YT link
<Bronysith> DALEKS
<Dken2021> ohai Tavros

<AttacktheAndalite> I keep getting buffer
<Tavros> hI Dken2021

<Cypresswolf> Shizuka: also, the linking book in the wall outside the prison part, that links to the thing next to the gun - containing a Relto book and a scope - Is there someone in that room? saw what may have been a person holding a book, but stationary
<cratorkid> dear esther screen for me
<arachnidsGrip> Did someone say Tavros ::::)
<lunac1> Lobster crates main menue

<MahBoi777> Polydunami: sorry, I'm trying to follow 3 chats at once >.<
<MahBoi777> mario_pony: SHUSH
<Dken2021> must be a result from a steam sale?
<Elondras> what now?
<otakon> no idea
<Polydunami> I see

<Darf14> wait its on steam..... great now im tempted to buy it >_<

<otakon> Eversion is some kind of freaky platformer
<AttacktheAndalite> getting buffer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This is a fun game.
<otakon> AttacktheAndalite: refresh
<Polydunami> Like I said, this is the steam VERSION of Eversion. There's a free version out there somewhere.
<otakon> AttacktheAndalite: it's working fine for me, though your ISP might be cutting you off
<otakon> Polydunami: yeah, Newgrounds most likely
<otakon> and now I got buffer
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon: Nah, I still get internet. And the stream just came up, no sound though
<Polydunami> Actually, no it was free first, then the stream.

<Dovah> I just need a perfect sneak headshot...
<Ponies47> I'm still here. People have been bugging me. -_-
<otakon> Dovah: you ALWAYS keep a seperate save from Dead Money since it's probably the toughest DLC of New Vegas even for a high level character.
<Polydunami> Also, could I post the website for the free version?
<kenne> otakon: oh dead money isnt that bad
<otakon> kenne: yes yes it is
<otakon> GODDAMMIT STREAM STOP LAGGIN!
<Pudge> what's dead money?
<kenne> otakon: in my opinion i thought it was the most fun DLC
<otakon> Pudge: DLC for Fallout New Vegas
<Pudge> ah
<Elondras> fail
<otakon> Pudge: basically think Resident Evil in Fallout is a good analogy.
<Ponies47> It's ok otakon it happens to me to :(

<Vordox> You see
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pudge: And pay twice to play online, or use Netflix?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Xbox Live Gold is a rip-off.

<Darf14> The limb doesnt hurt you, the hand does

<Pudge> Nittany_Discord: actually funny story about netflix, i'm not using mine, i'm using the netflix of the guy i bought it off of :D
<Polydunami> :P
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: HAH implying intelligence?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: well. that is not happening most likely
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Stop paying publishers to rip them off.

*Nittany_Discord 11,01shears Scoot-Scootaloo and makes a coat out of his wool.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's not the quality of the service.
<Pudge> It's pretty good to me
<Darf14> cant sleep.... hands will get me :O
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's having to pay for what you could get for free otherwise.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This game scares me...
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: paying for air?
<Darf14> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because it doesn't cost that much to do P2P
<Polydunami> This game really doesn't affect me that much anymore...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sony and Nintendo can offer it for free.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why not Microsoft?
<Pudge> Nittany_Discord: you have to understand, steam is very limited for me because I cant play most games
<Vinco> Because Microsoft
<Pudge> and nintendo's online service...TERRIBLE
<Polydunami> What online service?
<Darf14> .....ok I can agree on that
<MahBoi777> THE CLAW :O
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sony's is fine. Same architecture as XBL.
<Polydunami> The CLAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And Sony only charged premium for some things.

<cratorkid> SlurryMoon: a dating sim?
<Ponies47|Shower> Be back in a few. Shower yeah yeah. You know :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pudge: You might spend more on the 360 than the PS3 in the end especially putting up with online fees that shouldn't be there.
<Shamroc> SlurryMoon: did you only play womrs duin the free weekend? cause that would be coolf if we could play a game with ya
<Polydunami> You mean The Sims: Dating?
<Vordox> WHY IS SAINTS ROW SUCH A BAD arse game that gets praise?
<Vordox> bucking IGN
<SlurryMoon> 3I know
<Dken2021> Vordox IGN list?
<Dken2021> Worms eh?
<SlurryMoon> 3I'd love to play worms, but it's only full screen as far as I know
<CriticKitten> Yeah.
<CriticKitten> Sadly.
<CeilingKirz> 8,6yeah, it is >.<
<Shamroc> SlurryMoon...i got it to not goo full screen
<Barbetos> I like that pony picture in the background lol
<CriticKitten> There's a way around it.
<Vordox> w00tl how Shamroc ?
<SlurryMoon> 3Worms: Reloaded
<Shamroc> just alt tab out and resize your resolution...man instant non fullscreen
<Vordox> WAIT
<CriticKitten> But it's not a very good solution. >_>
<Vordox> You gonna play multiplayer Worms reloaded??!?! SlurryMoon !?
<Polydunami> Did somepony ping me?
<CeilingKirz> 8,6that's a horrible solution actually

*Bronysith sits on CeilingKirz
<Vordox> SlurryMoon: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1419479
<CriticKitten> The game minimizes when you click out of it.
<Pudge> Nittany_Discord: so at this point in time it's cheaper to have a 360, and it's only 10 bucks a month for live right now
<CriticKitten> So it'd be a bad solution.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Still a rip-off.
<Vordox> Here, solution =P
<Vinco> Polydunami: That could be confusing
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Tried it.

<Barbetos> My fear of hospitols came from Silent Hill XD

<sonicdude558> Ew zombie poop
<onlook> :O
<Syn_Virtu> what movie is this
<CriticKitten> Ah, and there's the blood, in delicious anime quantities no less
<Syn_Virtu> if it is a movie
<sonicdude558> The walking dead
<Shamroc> Syn_Virtu: not a movie...its a seires called the walking dead
<Syn_Virtu> oh

<Shamroc> WHY DIDNT YOU KEEP IT OPEN!
<Bronysith> Shamroc: it was in the script
<CriticKitten> ....oh god. >_>
<Doctor_Whooves> that match is gonna go out soon
<Barbetos> Anyone find being in a pitch black room comforting?
<CriticKitten> This guy wins a Darwin award
<FUS_RO_yay> no.
<cratorkid> Shamroc: by script he means comic
<sonicdude558> yay!
<Doctor_Whooves> @barbetos: hell no
<Dken2021> they never bring a flashlight...
<sonicdude558> Where is this soundboard
<CriticKitten> >walking impaired
<sonicdude558> just curious
<Bronysith> cratorkid: it was scripted in the comic
<CriticKitten> >walk down stairwell with no light source
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bright!
<sonicdude558> ah, just a normal gray day.
<Doctor_Whooves> gah! the sun, it burns us!
<cratorkid> Bronysith: /me nods
<cratorkid> derp
<Dken2021> sonicdude558 it's a ping when someone mention's a name or word
<CriticKitten> He's making good time for a guy who's been bed-ridden for that long
<sonicdude558> ok
<TrixieMuffins> in any given zombie setting , the concept of zombies is completely unknown , no zombie movies ever existed in those realities, the same aplies to common sense
<Dken2021> oh dear...
<Barbetos> CriticKitten he read the script. Its okay.
<Alchemist> so many sleepy people
<cratorkid> CriticKitten: ot to metion shot
<CriticKitten> Most people can't walk at all after that long of a timespan and....they're going to start getting up aren't they. XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That hospital went to hell.
<Shamroc> oh DAWMN!
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: I can say the patients were like.....DEAD
<Vordox> GET IT
<Vordox> HAHAHA
<Vordox> ...
<Alchemist> take that .50cal
*Vordox shuts up
<Bronysith> um
<CriticKitten> I still like how his room went totally unattacked for that entire period
<Bronysith> DAMN IT ZOEY you shot the pilot
<Barbetos> Quick. Upload the helicopter lessons.
<Doctor_Whooves> hey everypony, here's a question for you: if there were a zombie outbreak, and you knew that your chances of survival were slim pickins, would you fight to live, or would you just off yourself and spare the horrible pain of becoming undead?
<CriticKitten> Despite the only thing guarding it being a gurney
<Alchemist> CriticKitten: there is an explanation for that later on.
<Shamroc> Bronysith: he was a zombie francis I SHOT A AZOMBIE
<sonicdude558> Anyone know any words to ping to it?
<Vordox> Doctor_Whooves: I would live
<cratorkid> CriticKitten: you find out why later
<Vinco> Doctor_Whooves, fight for my life
<FUS_RO_yay> Doctor_Whooves: Fucking fight till the very end
<CriticKitten> ....
<Vordox> Eqqq
<Vordox> Ewwwww
<SlurryMoon> 3LAAAWL
<Vordox> Not exactly dangerous zombies.....
<SlurryMoon> 3LAAAWL
<CriticKitten> Aaaand that is where I'd puke.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Doctor_Whooves: Watch TV.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p
<Dken2021> whoah
<Shamroc> and slowly ride away on a bike
<Shamroc> haha
<CriticKitten> Also this guy is really talented.
<Vordox> I got logic, reasonable, quick witted, situation handling, never panic personality
<pony_9132> a zombie with no legs is gonna be dead slow
<Shamroc> inb4 zombeh wife
<Barbetos> Tagart!
<Vordox> I would live through the Zombie apoc
<CriticKitten> He was in a hospital bed for weeks, got right up and starting walking, then poof, he can ride a bike too!
<Bronysith> Shamroc: needs more explosive ammo
<Dovah> wut r we watching?
<Doctor_Whooves> all live, nice. I dont know if I would put a bullet in my brain or continue on. depends on how bad the situation was
<sonicdude558> Q_Q
<Dken2021> pony_9132 it would be dead weight
<cratorkid> Vordox: they all say that
<Doctor_Whooves> THE WALKING DEAD, AN AMC PRODUCTION
<Alchemist> You are tearing me apart lisa!
<Shamroc> AND THE FEELS
<AttacktheAndalite> Stream, whyyyyy?
<Shamroc> ALL THE FEELS
<Vordox> cratorkid: I AM that
<TrixieMuffins> depends on the kind of outbreak , if its the T-Virus , id dowhat wesker did
<Dken2021> TrixieMuffins become a god?
<cratorkid> is this real life?
<TrixieMuffins> yep
<Bronysith> HOPEFULLY when the zombie apoc comes...it is dead rising style
<Vordox> Denial
<Vordox> Depression
<CriticKitten> You know there's a distinct lack of walking dead in this show so far. Just the one girl who got headshot at the start, I think.
<Vordox> Acceptances
<Vordox> Courage
<Dken2021> TrixieMuffins too bad you aren't immune to lava
<Shamroc> Bronysith: when we can contain it and make a gameshow outa it?
<FUS_RO_yay> Bronysith: We put together a chainsaw and a paddle and get a paddlesaw?
<CriticKitten> I wanna see this guy tote a shotgun and kick some undead ass.
<Vordox> CriticKitten: The one near the bicycle then?
<Bronysith> Shamroc: well that too. but i mean just have em stumbling around, not fucking sprinting towards you
<Vinco> Doctor_Whooves: If I were trapped in a room with a single exit blocked by like 50 zombies with no one coming to help, I might take the bullet.
<CriticKitten> Vordox: That was more of a Crawling Dead.
<TrixieMuffins> well skinny dipping in a volcano would probably be way down on my to do list
<Vordox> OH CRAP
<sonicdude558> zombie in disquise
<Vordox> FECK
<cratorkid> wack!
<CriticKitten> Oh shit
<Bronysith> Shamroc: cause if they were like l4d zombies. it would be much tougher, funner, but tougher for actual survival
<TheHoodyNinja> YES it is eleven 30 and time to be random!
<CriticKitten> u ded
<TrixieMuffins> BONK
<Dken2021> ooh

<Doctor_Whooves> Mahboi, what's happenin!
<Alchemist> I like where this is going :D
<Vordox> COMMON COURTESY: SMACK FACE WITH SHOVEL

<AttacktheAndalite> Damnit, the stream's not working in Firefox, either.
<MahBoi777> hey Doctor_Whooves! nuthin much u?
<Doctor_Whooves> just chillaxin
*FUS_RO_yay forever alone
<MahBoi777> cool cool
<TheHoodyNinja> I know this seems random, but does anyone else think Tara voiced the girl from lolipop chainsaw sound like Twilight on purpose?
<Vordox> COMMON COURTESY
<Vordox> 'MUERICA
<AttacktheAndalite> I fucking give up.
<sonicdude558> yay!
<Dken2021> TheHoodyNinja probably pure coincidence, or maybe voice director wanted that way
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs AttacktheAndalite
<Tovler> now THAT is a twist. More emo characters should suddenly come out as having gender issues. /me returns to bronystate.
<Doctor_Whooves> uh oh, there's a change of situation ocuring that our protaganist doesnt like! oh the hijinks, oh the hijinks.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tovler: Wut?
*AttacktheAndalite hugs Nittany_Discord back.
<cratorkid> lol
<Dken2021> looks like they're prepared
<TheHoodyNinja> Dken2021: No seriously, her voice is ripped off directly from Twilight, they sound EXACTLY the same
<Bronysith> CALL THEM ZOMBIES. it would sound wrong if i say "Hey man i shot a walker today"
<TheHoodyNinja> badass kid
<Vinco> Welp, I'm tired. Goodnight, everyone!
<Bronysith> night Vinco
<FUS_RO_yay> gnight vinco
<CriticKitten> Bronysith: "He was a walker....a JAY Walker."
*Tovler picks a gay movie for B.
<Dken2021> nighty Vinco
<CeilingKirz> 8,6If you shoot Walker, you better get him in one shot, or he'll get you with a roundhouse
<FUS_RO_yay> LOL
<Doctor_Whooves> question: all this canned food is good for up to 3 year max. what happens when zeds are still around, and there's no one manufacturing the food? you either have to grow your own AMID ZOMBIES or die of hunger
<Bronysith> CeilingKirz: yup
<Bronysith> Tovler: brokeback mountain?
<CriticKitten> Kirz: You can't kill him with one shot. You'd have to doubletap, and he wouldn't give you a second shot.
<Tovler> Bronysith: nah, that movie is Bi. Also its A
<Dken2021> TheHoodyNinja maybe the voice director heard of her last role
<Bronysith> Tovler: but gay means homosexual. so what homosexual movie did you pick for B?
<TheHoodyNinja> Tovler: Magic mike?
<Doctor_Whooves> Tovler: Bi, huh? just like me! what about "I love you phillip morris?"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tovler: What are you on about?
<Tovler> Bronysith: I want to pick I <3 You Phillip Morris, but it's right smack in the middle of A and B.
<Doctor_Whooves> a and b?
<CriticKitten> ....
<CriticKitten> It's not nothing.
<TheHoodyNinja> ab movie
<CriticKitten> It's NEVER nothing in a zombie flick, dude.
<sonicdude558> a b c d e f g!
<Bronysith> This is why, you use MELEE weapons along with guns in the zombie apoc, silent kills and if it gets out of hand, YOU HAVE A GUN
<Tovler> Nittany_Discord: some anime where some bland character got retconned like 5 episodes later as a crossdresser but in a matter-of-factual way.
<Dken2021> holy crap, all of them
<TheHoodyNinja> she looks alive, kinda
<Shamroc> poor kid
<CriticKitten> :(
<Dken2021> mother?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tovler: Interesting.
<Shamroc> i would guess Dken2021
<Bronysith> Shamroc: i would not want to be his age when shit goes down like this
<CriticKitten> ....
<AttacktheAndalite> Dear stream, why do you hate me sooo?
<CriticKitten> Oh god.
<TheHoodyNinja> AttacktheAndalite: fine over here
<sonicdude558> drunk

<CriticKitten> ....
<TheHoodyNinja> Vordox: lol
<Shamroc> TheHoodyNinja: its borded up
<Tovler> Nittany_Discord: yeah. It's called Moyashimon. The anime is actually about college life and microbiology.
<Dken2021> CeilingKirz at least they don't have thumbs
<CriticKitten> So they CAN open doors.
<TheHoodyNinja> Shamroc: every bit count
<TheHoodyNinja> counts*
<GigabitHarmonie> Sorry ponies, I have to get to bed. I have work early in the morning, but a big thank you to the streamer for their work!

<Dken2021> so this is season 2 right?
<AttacktheAndalite> TheHoodyNinja: I don't know why it's doing this! I've refreshed 20+ times on Chrome, restarted teh browser, cleared the cache and then it buffers for 10 minutes and when a piture does show up, it's a still and there's no sound. Same thing for Firefox. I have the storage set to unlimited for both browsers. It was working perfectly fine earlier yesterday morning when Sumi and Wrek was streaming.

<TheHoodyNinja> Vordox: Alright, i guess im using the aluminum baseball bat next to my beed
<Firelight> gun Weapon of choice: The Grim Reaper from Call of Duty Black ops.
<Vordox> UNLESS Jspang1 ....You have a Hiroshi version
<Vordox> It cuts SO good there's no blood, Jspang1
<Firelight> BOOM! Headshot!
<Jspang1> Vordox: bt that would go for all melee weapons

<Vordox> CeilingKirz: MY WEAPON OF CHOICE http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/150/7/0/new_lunar_republic_by_makkon-d3hkznn.jpg
<Shamroc> Vordox: a banner?
<Dken2021> a poster?
<CeilingKirz> 8,6I'd also have a flamethrower, but can't show that pic :3
<TheHoodyNinja> Vordox: a poster?
<Firelight> Screamer in 3, 2............
<Vordox> You people... =P
<Jspang1> seriously tho, if you have to use a gun, a semi-auto rifle would be the best way to go, you can pick them off at a distance or even close range, and theres no danger of wasting all your ammo going full-auto
<fluttercry> 05,15soooo. what's going on?
<Shamroc> fluttercry: zombehs
<Vordox> fluttercry: Weapons of choice
<TheHoodyNinja> fluttercry: walking dead

<FUS_RO_yay> Vordox: to find and shoot his wife.
<FUS_RO_yay> OH SHIT
<Shamroc> Vordox: ventin steam man...gotta enjoy the little things
<Firelight> Waste of bullets.. And why would he do that? SEriou- thsi is why I dont watch this.
<FUS_RO_yay> SOrry, didnt actually mean to spoil anything.
<cratorkid> Jspang1: i prefer i pistol , extended magazines , lightweight , easy to run with , pistol ammo is easyer to find then rifle
<Firelight> Even though it's a good show.
<cratorkid> Firelight: watch , youll see why soon enough
<Vordox> That poor zombie...
<fluttercry> 05,15crawler zombie is sad
<Firelight> Oh my god.......
<CeilingKirz> 8,6guns aren't bad, but always carry a melee

<Jspang1> cratorkid: while that is true, you do run the risk of the rounds not penetrating the skin and bad aim, also, small clips
<Vordox> There...
<TheHoodyNinja> actually
<Vordox> she is...
<Firelight> Le' Gasp.
<Dovah> pfft who needs guns when u have armor that can survive a nuke?
<Vordox> Shooting his own wife...
<cratorkid> Jspang1: i guess its a meter of preference
<Firelight> Come on bro....
<Dken2021> my weapon of choce: a Chicago Typewriter
<Jspang1> cratorkid: so true
<Alister> Of course she HAS to be black , A blacj man couldn't possibly marry a white woman

<Dken2021> Trojan the Walking Dead, a series
<Jspang1> i never saw this show, this is the first time ive seen it
<CriticKitten> Oh no. ._.
<[SWAG]Haku> Just like a party college
<Trojan> oh thanks

<cratorkid> Firelight: she is laury
<Firelight> I know.... XD
<cratorkid> lol
<cratorkid> :D
<Firelight> Just love saying it.
<[SWAG]Haku> Fun Fact: The Zombie Apocalypse, even if it does occur, will only last for a year at max
<Firelight> Seriously.. I mean.. We have guns...
<Jspang1> isnt that the guys partner and wife?
<TheHoodyNinja> ^
<TheHoodyNinja> FUCK
<FUS_RO_yay> [SWAG]Haku: How come?
<cratorkid> [SWAG]Haku: why?
<TheHoodyNinja> damnit Firelight
<[SWAG]Haku> If Zombies are eating everyone, why are there so many zombies?
<MASF123> :(
<Jspang1> the zombies would rot
<Dken2021> the south's prepared for a zombiw apocalypse
<Firelight> Thehoodninja: lul
<TheHoodyNinja> FUS_RO_yay: because i kill all the zombies by then
<Firelight> Oh... well then..
<[SWAG]Haku> There shouldnt be that many since evryone who would become a zombie would be zombie chow
<Firelight> May I join?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They would decay within a year.
<FUS_RO_yay> But hey Highschool of the Dead explains why they would never decompose.
<Alchemist> get in the f*ckin house carl!!!!!
<Firelight> Lol
<[SWAG]Haku> not to mention the actual weapons that are at our disposal
<fluttercry> 05,15Carl! Why aren't you inside!?
<Jspang1> [SWAG]Haku: doont forget the fact that the zombies would rot away pretty quickly
<OohShiny> sup everypony
<Doctor_Whooves> how would they never decompose?
<[SWAG]Haku> And then theres the weather
<Firelight> Chores? During a zombie invasion?!
<Firelight> Fuck you!
<MahBoi777> hey OohShiny
<TheHoodyNinja> FUS_RO_yay: Wait, i never caught that part, when does they do that?
<Dken2021> lali-h OohShiny
<Doctor_Whooves> I would love to hear this.
<TheHoodyNinja> hello OohShiny
<[SWAG]Haku> In the Winter, Zombies will become stiff. In the Summer, theyll decompose faster
<Shamroc> dat lack of gas
<MASF123> Goin' the the brony network... :'(
<Jspang1> IIIII was born a ramblin man!
<FUS_RO_yay> TheHoodyNinja: Its like episode 2 or 3, i believe they talk about something like that
<TheHoodyNinja> damnit
<[SWAG]Haku> Then there's the animals that would gladly eat rotting corpses
<OohShiny> I'm fine. I hope you may be fine too.
<TheHoodyNinja> now i have to rewatch it
<TheHoodyNinja> FUS_RO_yay: that show got cancelled, didnt it?
<Firelight> Zooooombiiiiies
<Dken2021> [SWAG]Haku what about infected animals?
<Jspang1> dat magnum
<Shamroc> her her ima cop give me stuff
<Shamroc> also
<cratorkid> its awesome how each episode of this is an hour long
<Shamroc> zombies
<Jspang1> beautiful gun
<Firelight> Anyone stoked for the Dick figures movie?
<Doctor_Whooves> it's still human flesh, no matter what kind of virus is currently flowing through it. Flesh decays and rots.
<Jspang1> i fucking love magnum revolvers
<Shamroc> BUUG
<Jspang1> also dat lag
<OohShiny> walking dead?
<[SWAG]Haku> A virus like the zombie one would only be able to effect more advanse brains
<TheHoodyNinja> dead
<FUS_RO_yay> TheHoodyNinja: I dont believe it was canceled, just had a very long break. Rumors are still flying though so no definite response yet.
<Firelight> *Random zombie popout in 3,2
<[SWAG]Haku> Animals may get the disease, but they would only die from it, and not come back
<TheHoodyNinja> dem flies
<Alchemist> waste of a good carpet
<OohShiny> is this walking dead?
<TheHoodyNinja> Firelight: no spoilers
<TheHoodyNinja> AMMO INSIDE
<Firelight> lul
<fluttercry> 05,15OohShiny yes
<TheHoodyNinja> HE HAS A SHOTGUN
<fluttercry> 05,15Pills here!
<TheHoodyNinja> GO GET IT DUMBASS
<Jspang1> steal ALL the ammo
<FUS_RO_yay> Cmon, go grab it man
<Doctor_Whooves> Fus ro yay: season 3 of walking dead or my little pony?
<fluttercry> 05,15TheHoodyNinja he has a ton of ammo and guns.
<Jspang1> or the cat
<TheHoodyNinja> keys on the body?
<fluttercry> 05,15Ammo has weight
<Jspang1> car*
<cratorkid> APPLEJACK
<FUS_RO_yay> Could never decide
<TheHoodyNinja> fluttercry: never have too much ammo
<Firelight> Apple BLOOPLE
<Firelight> Dat Pony
<Trojan_Flames> Everypony excited for season 3?
<CriticKitten> fluttercry: Not in the video games!
<Alchemist> also ammo has weight and not all ammo is good for any weapon (even shotgun shells)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There's really zero prob of a real-life zombie outbreak.
<[SWAG]Haku> A disease can only infect a certain number of creatures, because thats how it evolved. If it was created, then the amount of creatures it would infect would be even less
<Ponies47> PONY!
<Ponies47> :p
<Barbetos> Deputy Fence Post!
<Jspang1> that horse should have been eaten by now
<fluttercry> 05,15you can EASILY have too much ammo. Bullets weigh quite a bit
<TheHoodyNinja> Nittany_Discord: damn
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<Jspang1> also, horse is not too good a zombie vehicle
<FUS_RO_yay> Ninja would never die with this zombie apoc logic
<Jspang1> it panics as soon as it smells one
<FUS_RO_yay> ninjas*
<Jspang1> leaves you to die
<CriticKitten> Horse is like "fuck dis shit, I was happy where I was"
<cratorkid> horses are probobly the best way of mobility during an outbreak
<Firelight> What I would do in a zombie apocolypes: *crawls in Dark hole with laptop and bannana.
<OohShiny> well, the post-apocaliptic world sucks
<Firelight> life = Complete
<[SWAG]Haku> There shouldnt even be a city any more; once the army got over run, the government would most likely just bomb the hell out of it
<TheHoodyNinja> dem cars
<Dken2021> Firelight but all the ISPs would be dead
<fluttercry> 05,15You know what you would probably do in a zombie apocolypse? Be dead
<Alchemist> I hope the horse has peoper horseshoes, trotting on concrete and stuff...
<Jspang1> cratorkid: no theyre not they panic if they so much as catch a wiff of a zombie and leave you to die
<CriticKitten> .....not looking very safe there, bro
<Firelight> Dken2021: Oh... FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
<Barbetos> The forever traffic jam = the worst part of a zombie out break.
<FUS_RO_yay> fluttercry: dont remind me.
<fluttercry> 05,15Because not only would there be zombies, but there would be total anarchy and looting
<Doctor_Whooves> CLOP CLOP CLOP
<TheHoodyNinja> How do I pm people?
<Firelight> Guys, Before we kill all of these zombies just reconsider that their is NO MORE Traffic jams!!!!
<Firelight> Jsut saying..
<Jspang1> alerted the horde in 3... 2... 1...
<Shamroc> TheHoodyNinja: right click their name on the chat bar on the right...then click open personal message
<Jspang1> GET TO THA CHOPPA
<Dken2021> click their names or type /msg "name" "message"
<JESmith71> HoodyNinja, double click someone's name on the list on the right
<Doctor_Whooves> zombie ponies confirmed!
<[SWAG]Haku> There will always be traffic jams in huge things
<Firelight> Dat Buss
<[SWAG]Haku> Highways arent made for the huge amount of people leaving
<CriticKitten> SHIT
<Dken2021> fuuuu
<Jspang1> idk why he doesnt steal that hummer, it was fucking armor plated
<xxMoopyxx> ok im here dude
<Firelight> Dumbass
<therainbowvortex> is this the walking dead
<[SWAG]Haku> yes
<Dken2021> why yes it is
<Alchemist> This is how I look like after waking up.
<cratorkid> Jspang1: you dont know that , they could walk right past it and not notice, they dont need fuel like cars do , just let them graze by the side of the road , and there not as load as an engine
<fluttercry> 05,15Jspang1 probably doesn't have keys...or gas...
<Shamroc> DAT TANK!
<Firelight> Oh yeah!
<Firelight> It's all comin' back
<Dken2021> yea, horses not the best mobility, they're scared of everything
<Jspang1> cratorkid: maybe...
<Firelight> He gets in dat tank..
<CriticKitten> ....
<Firelight> but dosnt drive it..
<Firelight> oops..
<Jspang1> cratorkid: i think a mountain bike might be better
<CriticKitten> >military has tanks and heavy weapons
<CriticKitten> >can't deal with zombie infestation
<therainbowvortex> is there gona be a session 3
<Doctor_Whooves> like river song says: "SPOILERS"
<fluttercry> 05,15...do you people have any idea how hard it is to drive tanks?
<Shamroc> Firelight: for the love of god! stop tellin us what happens next!
<Tovler> I wonder if you can have zombie birds?
<cratorkid> Jspang1: makes you use calories which mkes you eat more
<fluttercry> 05,15OH SHI_

<TheHoodyNenja> get deathed
<[SWAG]Haku> Why even kill an attacking zombie? There's no need to actually kill it, especially since it's actually extremely hard to get a head shot IRL. It would be best just to immobolize one, like just break it's neck.
<TheHoodyNenja> who be this?
<TheHoodyNenja> wait was he here last time?
<AttacktheAndalite> Nothing's playing on my end when I pressed the play button, and all I see is the loading screen

<mario_pony> wow they are horrible
<AttacktheAndalite> MahBoi777: Stream buffers on my end and when I get a picture, it's a still and doesn't play at all. I deleted all my cookies, cleared my caches, and set the video storage to unlimited for Firefox and Chrome.

<TheHoodyNenja> oh
<CriticKitten> ...
<AttacktheAndalite> MahBoi777: Tell me about it. It was working pefectly fine when Sumi was streaming DickJensen
<sonicrainboomer259|b> ....wooooah

<MahBoi777> AttacktheAndalite: that's strange
<[SWAG]Haku> Yay, pills

<mario_pony> dammit
<[SWAG]Haku> I think ponies
<JESmith71> You go anwyay
<bolty> legit
<CriticKitten> But the real question is, does it seem MLG legit?
<MahBoi777> WalkerPony89: indeed XD
<Vordox> You know Slurrymoon.... There's one thing I'll say o you now...The comic is AMAZING, I took an interested in it after episode 1.... READ it if you want something good... :) And some characters in this video game ....wow... I'll just say that.
<AttacktheAndalite> MahBoi777: It never started doing this until Slurry strarted straeming. Everyone in my apartment building/complex is more than likely sleeping so it's not full.
<Dken2021> welp, kept looking at Eversion, consider me to be frightened to sleep
<sonicrainboomer259|b> yaay
<[SWAG]Haku> Vegan life
<TheHoodyNenja> so the bite cant turn you
<TheHoodyNenja> dying does
<TrixieMuffins> shoot em now , test that everyone comes back theory
<WalkerPony89> AttacktheAndalite: Could be that your computer doesn't like mips.tv
<mario_pony> lol
<TheHoodyNenja> that means if you get bit you can survive
<MahBoi777> AttacktheAndalite: maybe it's just the stream
<Dken2021> nice textures
<sonicrainboomer259|b> like larry the asshole
<Polydunami> Oh come on, Eversion isn't THAT scary... is it not? :S
<Polydunami> Also, got sidetracked by the internet. Again.
<Vordox> Polydunami: Play it....
<AttacktheAndalite> MahBoi777: I don't think so because the straem is working fine for everyone else. It seems to be doing this to just me.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> and thhen a zombie jumps out of a bush
<Vordox> Polydunami: Trust me, it's BUCKING madness later parts.
<mario_pony> yesh
<TheHoodyNenja> dat flanking
<Polydunami> STOP
<Polydunami> I SEE YOU
<Dken2021> Polydunami not that scary,, but still creepy when it devolved from happy and cute to depressing
<WalkerPony89> AttacktheAndalite: It's choppy for me. I've also had a lot of problems with mips not working before
<Polydunami> No, see, I've played the game. Not too scared by it...
<JESmith71> Yeah it didn't matter if you chopped that guy's leg off or not. He would have been the zombie instead of that other guy
<Vordox> Polydunami: Then you don't have the right mindset
<Polydunami> Hmm?
<TrixieMuffins> maneating rednecks ?
<Dken2021> potential zombies?
<MahBoi777> AttacktheAndalite: hmmmm, could it be the embedded?

<sonicrainboomer259|b> CrimsonPhoenix: he's gone too bronycon,he made a smile smile smile parody,and is doing episode reviews
<peepdust> They are way too upbeat to be trusted
<TheHoodyNenja> CrimsonPhoenix: I have to disagree

<Vordox> peepdust: Optimisms gets you fa

<Xaiden> dafuq
<Shizuka> 13also is dawnguard on sale / even out?
<Pudge> Yay!
<CriticKitten> I know, right? Why would you pick Skyrim for 50% off when you could get it already for 33% off, and it'll clearly be on sale later? >_>
<Shizuka> 13another dis
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: But...skyrim isn't a "game" =P
<Xaiden> SuperBrony64: What's the price then, $30?
<Shizuka> 13Vordox: you're right, skyrim is a lifestyle
<CriticKitten> Deus Ex HR for 75% off was WAY better.
<scottish-geeky> helo evry pony
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Xaiden: Yesh
<Vordox> Shizuka: Eyup
<OmegaMetroidBrony> OH hai scottish-geeky
<Vordox> Shizuka: But I prefer my current lifestyle
<scottish-geeky> hia OmegaMetroidBrony
<Xaiden> SuperBrony64: Ehhh, I'd buy it, but my comp sucks so it would be pointless
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i miss playing morrowind .. even if it was on xbox ..
<Xaiden> Guess I'll just have to by a PS3 copy
<starsong> wut
<Shizuka> 13hai trixie
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I already got Skyrim for 50% off when they originally had it at that price...I wanted MW3 for 50% off ;A;
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai Shizuka
<OmegaMetroidBrony> You can get Morrowind on the comp. DOSbox emulator.... gotta ask my friend how
<CriticKitten> I'm legit disappointed by that. Would've bought HR at 75% off probably. But I HAVE Skyrim, so that sale means nothing. And I got it for cheaper than that, anyways. :/
*scottish-geeky is a sneky ninja and sneks up be hind Ponies47
<xxMoopyxx> i hate MW3
<starsong> Oh i saw skyrim before, are they doing fifty percent off today?
<CriticKitten> In 30 minutes, yes.
<starsong> yay
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Get BF3:P
<starsong> so how much is it?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> > get new games from steam > keep playing LoL or doing other stuff
<Pudge> i'd much prefer skyrim at 50% off
<CriticKitten> At 50% off, it'd be....30 bucks.
<scottish-geeky> MahBoi777: halo
<MahBoi777> hey scottish-geeky
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Is there a reason why Steam doesn't have Battlefield 3? O.O
<starsong> wait i thought it cost 60
<Shizuka> 13because hallowed are the ori
<Shamroc> SuperBrony64: ea doesnt like steam
<starsong> yeah...
<Xaiden> Steam doesn't have BF3?
<CriticKitten> Damnit, we could've had Human Revolution for like 8 bucks. ;_;
<Shamroc> Xaiden: its on origon...
<scottish-geeky> MahBoi777: u here DeadPool is going to get his oune game
<starsong> because ea is fucking retarted and they wanted to make a copy of steem and failed misribly
<OmegaMetroidBrony> It's called Origin... it's like IE
<CriticKitten> Instead we get another meaningless Skyrim discount.
<Xaiden> Shamroc: Ohhhh
<MahBoi777> scottish-geeky: yup!
<CriticKitten> *pout face*
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> SuperBrony64 origin
<xxMoopyxx> brb

<OmegaMetroidBrony> This link should explain http://cheezburger.com/6153872640
<SuperBrony64> 11,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Yeah...that's what I figured :/
<Tovler> and I just can't hide it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> OmegaMetroidBrony, I don't really get it
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O
<CriticKitten> Yeah, everything EA's made lately is Origin-only, SB. They want to force people to use it.
<Tovler> Tovlerone
<CrimsonPhoenix> Explorer has been around since forever
<CriticKitten> Which is precisely why I've just....not bought any EA games instead. Good marketing strategy, morons! :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> way before Chrome

<Tovler> lol
<starsong> i was considering getting skyrim today
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Awww....MW3 is $45 on Steam :<
<OmegaMetroidBrony> It's kinda describing how Chrome is Superior to IE and how Steam is Chrom and Origin is IE

<CrimsonPhoenix> OmegaMetroidBrony, figured but that reason alone shouldn't really be the only cause for that picture to be relevent
<CriticKitten> starsong: Your face when the game was on sale earlier in the sale for the same price and probably would've been on sale on the last day too. :P
<MahBoi777> hi RainBowJack!
*scottish-geeky hugs RainBowJack
<CriticKitten> Bad Slurry!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :/
<JESmith71> I've never been able to play Skyrim. Don't have the PC requirements and I hear there's problems with the PS3 version
*RainBowJack hugs MahBoi777
<SuperBrony64> 11,02SlurryMoon: Nooooooo

<CrimsonPhoenix> MFW Deus Ex is what I would pick http://derpy.me/NwAZR
<Vordox> Wrek, ya here?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I think I lost out on their super badge thingy on Steam...because I don't think I voted everyday on the Steam sale >>
<Vordox> Oh wait...he may be drunk
<CriticKitten> Not that it matters.
<CriticKitten> The badges are like points on Whose Line.
<CrimsonPhoenix> also guys
<CrimsonPhoenix> the best deals are always the packs
<scottish-geeky> MahBoi777: blurrrg
<MahBoi777> Blargh
<scottish-geeky> lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://store.steampowered.com/sub/15465/ like this one
<Tovler> gary's not a loser :(
<CriticKitten> Crimson: Assuming you want all those games. XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> when activision was actually relevent
<Derpy_ears> lol
*AttackAndalite|Zzz goes to bed "Zzzz"
<CrimsonPhoenix> and Square Enix pack is possibly the best
<CriticKitten> Crimson: Again, assuming you want all those games. XD
<scottish-geeky> ohhh ouch
<CrimsonPhoenix> CriticKitten, Why wouldn't you?
<CriticKitten> A lot of 'em are games I'd never play.
<CrimsonPhoenix> good enough reason to open your mind and try them
<Ponies47> My (squee) is a (squee) and (squee) with it's (squee) and (squee) (squee) I will (squee) (squee) (squee) with (squee) in the (squee) (squee) chocolate pudding (squee) (squee) so then it will have to process backwards (squee) -_-
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: raaaaw im a dino
<CriticKitten> I don't bother with packs unless they have at least two or three I really want.
<Ponies47> *My computer
<CriticKitten> Since the packs are all full-priced game price tags.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hitman is a VERY good series
<CrimsonPhoenix> as well as Deus EX
<CrimsonPhoenix> Thief is great ....as ...well
<CrimsonPhoenix> ok Square enix pack is for fans of stealth game
<CriticKitten> I've already made out with three games and a good amount of DLC for just over $20, I don't need twenty games (most of which I won't play). >.>
<Shizuka> 13video/audio is still good ja?
<Tovler> Did I miss the Rifftrax of Terminator 3 and 4?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and Sega pack is for nostalgic people
<CriticKitten> Yup.
<Shizuka> 13ja last week
<Tovler> both of them?
<Vordox> There's so many things going on in this movie... http://img199.imageshack.us/img199/4953/misaoobject.gif There There There There There There There There There There
<Shizuka> 13ja showed them thursday
<Tovler> :'(
<CrimsonPhoenix> CriticKitten, it's all in the money really
<CriticKitten> Crimson: Exactly, and I don't consider buying a twenty-game pack so I can have two of them a good deal. :p
<CrimsonPhoenix> whenever you would want to try something out of the blue BAM you got it and you didn't have to pay because you had a huge deal.
<CriticKitten> Skippy!
<CriticKitten> Must be Slippy's cousin.
<CrimsonPhoenix> like the price of one pack is the same price of one full game
<CrimsonPhoenix> you're saving shitton
<CriticKitten> ....car in glove compartment....carception
<CriticKitten> Crimson: Only if you play all of those games.
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's an just in case reason
<CriticKitten> Crimson: Otherwise you're spending 40-50 extra bucks for one or two games you want and a bunch you don't. :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> never know maybe in the future someone would recommend it to you and then you'll sudenly have it
<CrimsonPhoenix> 40 50 extra?
<CrimsonPhoenix> what?
<CrimsonPhoenix> no seriously what?
<Vordox> I miss WoW alittle bit...
<CriticKitten> The stuff in the packs that is the most desirable is usually on sale by itself for under 10 bucks.
<CriticKitten> >_>
<CrimsonPhoenix> You want small indie games?
<pony_9695> what the fuck this isnt ponies
<CriticKitten> So if I want just that game, why spend 60 bucks when I can buy it for 10? :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's 50
<CriticKitten> 50, then. 10 is still the better deal. :p
<SlurryMoon> 3just to let ya know, i'm getting a buffer, Shizu
<OtakuTom> I haven't touched WoW in a while, either. I'm pretty much just waiting for Mists of Pandaria. If my guess is correct, we have 62 days until it comes out.
<Shizuka> 13is still solid up here
<CriticKitten> I don't deny the packs are a good deal, but only if you like to play a wide variety of games and intend to play most or every game in the pack.
<pony_9695> where are the fucking ponies
<SlurryMoon> 3okay, it's back
<CrimsonPhoenix> I guess I just love having a huge library just in case
<CriticKitten> If you're like me and only play a handful of games, once in a while, you buy what you want and that's it.
<Shizuka> 13i know that feel crimson~
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5509/
<Shizuka> 13wish torchlight 2 would release .-.
<pony_9695> why would you kick me:(
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Agreed.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh yeah I gave you that right?
<Shizuka> 13jajaja <3
<Ponies47> scottish-geeky: bad
<Tovler> I just noticed that this "wide-screen" movie is actually cropped
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: im sarry
<Shizuka> 13Tovler: it's a 640x480 viewport
<Shizuka> 134:3, the movie is more 16:10
<Ponies47> pony_9695: Did you type 6 messages in 10 seconds?
<Ponies47> scottish-geeky: IIt's kewl ^^
<scottish-geeky> yay
<CriticKitten> Crimson: And that's cool, if you like playing a lot of games. I'm not that sort of guy though.
<Shizuka> 13Ponies47: he joined and immediately started complaining
<CriticKitten> Crimson: I like buying a handful of games and playing the everloving shit out of them for many many hours.
<Ponies47> Shizuka: Pfffft. New comers sometimes *Rolls his eyes*
<CriticKitten> Amnesia, the Dark Descent?
<Shizuka> 13ikr
<CriticKitten> Or perhaps Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs?
<CrimsonPhoenix> CriticKitten, We're both in a different plane of opinion then
<scottish-geeky> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5318/ the cute it burns
<CrimsonPhoenix> scottish-geeky, could've been worse
<CriticKitten> Crimson: Yar. For you, the packs are good. I'm just a different type of gamer. I'm perfectly happy with a smaller library of games I can juice for hours of fun at a time. Both are perfectly valid ways to game. There's never a wrong way. /)
<Alchemist> scottish-geeky: did you see the rest of that set?
<CrimsonPhoenix> she could've had her actual color
<Ponies47> Shizuka: eeeyup. When I first joined I didn't say anything about why there wasen't ponies on.
<scottish-geeky> Alchemist: what u mean
<Loopy_Legend> Afternoon all.
<CriticKitten> ....
<CriticKitten> Dat crescent wrench
<CriticKitten> Matt Damon is....the most bland man in the world.
<Loopy_Legend> What's going on around here?
<Shizuka> 13he is very square
<CrimsonPhoenix> scottish-geeky, http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2869/
<CriticKitten> And he doesn't always drink. But when he does, he prefers generic brand beer.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just beat you in cuteness
<Shizuka> 13mike would make a good dj
<CriticKitten> Stay boring, my friends.
<Alchemist> scottish-geeky: like this: http://derpy.me/gfh42
<Tovler> idunno, Matt Damon was pretty animated in Gerry
<scottish-geeky> CrimsonPhoenix: dwaaa
<CriticKitten> Damon invented the bland acting face. Stewart is just failing to do it right.
<Alchemist> scottish-geeky: and this: http://derpy.me/VzCYF
<Alchemist> and the rest
<CriticKitten> XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> newbies general http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2961/
<scottish-geeky> Alchemist: the Aj one look like shee chalingin me the Raity one eys are staring in to my soul
<Tovler> 80 trillion Lyras *dies*
<CriticKitten> "You wanna come up and do an action scene or something?" Is that what they're calling it now?
<Shizuka> 13i liked damon in the ocean's series
<Tovler> Oceans Triliogy next week?
<Alchemist> scottish-geeky: I think RD is more challenging than AJ http://derpy.me/m63DY
<CriticKitten> Oh don't get me wrong, Damon isn't too bad. My point was more that he's the only actor I know who manages to act with such a bland face and yet still does a decent job in the role. xD
<scottish-geeky> Alchemist: lol
<CriticKitten> It's what I *think* Kristen Stewart is going for, and failing miserably at.
<RainBowJack> Alchemist: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2470/
<CriticKitten> Or she could just be stoned as hell every time a camera is focused on her. Hard to be sure.
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: Them newcomers. Most of them are always whinning about wanting ponies. -_-
<Tovler> I need to see The Runaways or Adventure Land before I can judge Kristen Stewart
<TheHoodyNenja> Yes they are
<TheHoodyNenja> and i got lost in the internet
<CriticKitten> Tovler: Or just Twilight. Or the Snow White movie she singlehandedly ruined. :P
<CriticKitten> Dat number
<MadSurge> Morning Bronystate! :$
<TheHoodyNenja> hai MadSurge
<Loopy_Legend> Afternoon here.
<Alchemist> RainBowJack: are you disturbed yet? http://derpy.me/XHZ-u
<Tovler> yep. She ruined Twilight, an otherwise good movie.
<MadSurge> Shizuka stream, I see! <3
<Shizuka> 13ayup
<CriticKitten> Tovler: O u
<RainBowJack> Alxhemist : give me dat HUG!!!
<CriticKitten> Herman Cain?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3257/ Translator note: Keikaku means plan.
<TheHoodyNenja> I wanta hug :(
<MadSurge> CriticKitten: because that snow white movie wasn't doomed before she was cast :D
<CriticKitten> XD
<TheHoodyNenja> CrimsonPhoenix: wait then why have the first 3 words in english?
<scottish-geeky> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5110/
<CriticKitten> MadSurge: They cast the queen well.
<CrimsonPhoenix> TheHoodyNenja, that's the joke
<CriticKitten> MadSurge: You can't go wrong with Theron.
<Alchemist> RainBowJack: sorry, all I have atm is this, but I give it with a discount :3 http://derpy.me/2UvXV
<CrimsonPhoenix> some translator of animes do that shit
<CrimsonPhoenix> like with kawaii
<CrimsonPhoenix> translator not: kawaii means cute
<RainBowJack> I would marrie this http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4615/
<CriticKitten> MadSurge: And the guy who plays Thor isn't too bad, either.
<TheHoodyNenja> RainBowJack: What the Colledge kid hugging Pinkie Pie?
<CrimsonPhoenix> RainBowJack, not if I did it first
<CrimsonPhoenix> swag
<RainBowJack> Alchemist : i would like that hug too
<Tovler> I'll pirate Snow White eventually.
<TheHoodyNenja> dat death cup
*MadSurge just hates grimdark revisitations
<CriticKitten> MadSurge: Stewart was the BIG casting misstep though. That instantly doomed it. Implying Theron isn't as hot as Stewart? FUUUUUUUUUU
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3695/ just look at my swag
<MadSurge> I mean, the original Snowhite was already dark enough :D
<CriticKitten> Dis sales pitch
<Tovler> That doesn't bother me since all white people look alike.
<scottish-geeky> CrimsonPhoenix: swag is for boys class is for men
<CriticKitten> MadSurge: The normal Snow White story IS kind of dark, man. >_>
<Tovler> Who's Mark Wahlberg fighting?
<MadSurge> CriticKitten: yep
<TheHoodyNenja> lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> scottish-geeky, http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/789/
<CriticKitten> HOW'D IT GET BURNED
<TheHoodyNenja> CrimsonPhoenix: dat swag

<Alchemist> MadSurge: its protocol
<Ponies47> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5731/ <- Newcomers to #bronystate in a nutshell. They look at the stream for 5 seconds and then this is there reaction when there are no ponies on.
<Shizuka> 13ep 6 i think is where i left off a few weeks ago
<Vordox> Awesome Shizuka . I'll catch up on my freetime

<Shizuka> 13haibane is the purgatory one

<RAWRity> and I like to subvert expectations.
<Soul> what story? :<
<Imperios> She gathers Elements of Harmony - THE ORIGINAL elements of harmony.

<Soul> cool
<Imperios> Celestia quickly hides hers, others... well...

<RAWRity> so, I'm loving having my own car.
<TheHoodyNenja> lol attack poodles
<CriticKitten> Good news, people who enjoy bland EA FPS games! The new Medal of Honor will have a beta invite for Battlefield 4, so you'll get twice the mediocrity!
<Ponies47> Soul: And what does he think? :3
<Tovler> I guess there is no rifftrax on The Hulk
*MadSurge isn't too fond of conspiracy/nonstop action movies
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: its American its 12 wear im at

<RAWRity> Like, today, I wanted to eat at Wendy's. So like, I just....DROVE there. No walking. No bus rides. Just...Point A - Point B
*Shizuka 13wonders if rain ist still awake
<CriticKitten> Shizu: I do feel tired all the time. I can never catch up on my sleep. So I just collapse when my body tells me to. :(
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: Much as I hate to say it, maybe lay off the late night bronystating?
<Shizuka> 13i have been getting 8-10 hours for weeks but it is 4am-12pm so i still feel tired...
<Tovler> Neither Hulk has been riffed.
<Shizuka> 13stressful family gets home just as i am properly awake...
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: But, but, Shizustream. :(
<Shizuka> 13makes me go later und later until i start going to bed just before sunrise...
<Tovler> Wickerman reference
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: sometimes, personal health takes precedence over rifftrax and nostalgic shows.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Blasphemy!
<Shizuka> 13health..?
<Shizuka> 13was ist..
<Tovler> It think its HP
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: if ur mom is mad you prob go to bed i dont want u in troble
<Soul> ive always been a nightowl, my family always finds me on the couch with the TV on in the morning
<CriticKitten> Besides, I'm fine. I've been like this for as long as I can remember.
<Soul> some times asleep, sometimes not :P
<RAWRity> that's not necessarily "fine"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i have imsomnia :D
<CriticKitten> My body has this....thing where it insists on sleeping in, no matter when I go to bed.
<RAWRity> I think that counts more as "functioning"
<OtakuTom> I work overnights, so this is my "daytime", despite it being dark out :P
<TheHoodyNenja> Holy shit
*Shizuka 13ist just bipolar..
<TheHoodyNenja> its late
<TheHoodyNenja> i thought it was 10 O'clock
<TheHoodyNenja> :p
<Ponies47> scottish-geeky: She's all the way on the other side of the house! Plus I can't sleep at this time *Yawns* I really can't this early :p
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Pft, I've never been healthy. :P
<Soul> the only ttime i actually was affected was when i stayed up all night and all day when i was litte, i threw up
<Rain> Im no better, Shizuka. dont feel bad :p
<Soul> *little
<Shizuka> 13rain rain~<33
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: lols same here exept my mom dosent care rilly
*Shizuka 13pounces rain rain
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: But I'm not exactly sick or anything. I'm fine. Just perpetually sleepy, regardless of sleep cycle. :p
*Rain giggles and snuggles with Shizuka <3
<MadSurge> Shizuka: So you're bipolar? :D
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: Fairly certain that counts as chronic fatigue...
<Tovler> heh, bipolar bear
<Shizuka> 13as far as i know, never been officially diagnosed but there's a clear cycle that's been there for years now...
<Shizuka> 13and not THAT cycle... they sometimes line up sometimes now...
<Rain> XD
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Only if it's severe enough to hamper the body's function.
<Rain> I know what you mean, Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13<3
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: I could still go outside and jog if I wanted, for example. I'm not actually sick. My body just likes to sleep.
<RAWRity> my ex-gf was bipolar. Or at least, that was the diagnosis at the time. A little while after we broke up, her new doctor said she had Borderline Dissociative Identity Disorder.
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: i like pony
<Ponies47> Me to :3
<Shizuka> 13i think DID is starting to get overdone...
<CriticKitten> Hell, I actually feel awake enough right now that I could do exercise. I really should be exercising more anyways. :P
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: buy a treadmill for your house. Watch BS while jogging.
<Shizuka> 13i would ride around the neighborhood but it is far to hot und humid lately...
<CriticKitten> Body's just sleepy, is all. I've been this way since I was a kid. I'll go to sleep early, wake up mid-day. Go to sleep late, wake up mid-day. My body just KNOWS.
<Rain> Shizuka, DID isnt getting overdone, people falsely claiming to have it is getting overdone
<Shizuka> 13ja that too
<RAWRity> have you tried an alarm clock?
<CriticKitten> I use one when I need to go somewhere early in the morning. :P
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: u have enny pony stuf
<Shizuka> 13i use one when i need to be awake at a certain time... und even then i rely on my brain remembering OH I HAVE TO BE AWAKE RIGHT NOW when it goes off
<Shizuka> 13otherwise i just snooze it and go back to bed
*MadSurge suddendly realizes why angry Shizuka is scary
<CrimsonPhoenix> ummm guys, does anyone knows Ian Corlett?
<Ponies47> scottish-geeky: 2 pony T-shirts and a brony wristband :P
<CriticKitten> 'sides, I'm apparently a lot like my mom. She's the same way. Odd sleep cycle, and achey. :P
<RAWRity> I actually modded my alarm clock to disable the snooze button.
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: lukky i got a toy and thats it
<CriticKitten> So I'm already built like an old person, that'll make me the best old guy ever. I'll be beating kids up with my cane.
<Shizuka> 13CrimsonPhoenix: played cheetor and bob, forget if i heard him somewhere else

<Soul> oh ok

<OtakuTom> lol...woobat
<TheHoodyNenja> scottish-geeky: get it yourself
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Anyways, appreciate the concern, but I'm good. No need to worry. If I ever feel sick, believe me, I'll take it easy, I can be lazy like no one else. But I'm fine. Really.

*SuperBrony64 hugs Phase4 back
<Ponies47> I hope to get a new computer this year ^^
<Ponies47> I killed the chat :'(
<OtakuTom> I'm waiting until October to buy a new gaming laptop. This laptop will still be in use for drawing and general internet-y stuff, but I'm having a lot of problems trying to launch any Windows-based games on it.
<MadSurge> :O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Darn :/
<Ponies47> My desktop is 9 years old. When I do get a new computer. Shoudl I get a Laptop or a Desktop?
<MadSurge> BUNNY CLOSEUP
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, need help
<Ponies47> *should
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Nah, I got this :3
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> deskotp :P
<Phase4> 00,02i see bunny
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It's time for my latest invention!
<DashWithRainbows> depends on what you plan on using it for Ponies47.
<Ponies47> Internet, Steam, Stuff liek that :P
<Ponies47> *like
<DashWithRainbows> I'd go for desktop then.
<Ponies47> My dad says I should get a laptop so I can have it on the go. IDK if I shoudl or not. IDK if Steam and Steam games would work that good on a laptop :/
<DashWithRainbows> I've got a laptop, and so does Phase4.
<Phase4> 00,02laptops are best
<DashWithRainbows> Mine plays TF2 and some other games quite well, especially since it's all stock parts.
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> Im on a lapp top atm but im not used to it it its very irretating
<DashWithRainbows> And since you can have them on the go, you can game anywhere when bored.
<Phase4> 00,02i understand the 'it cant be upgraded' argument but in all practicality its more cost efficent to get a new machine every few years anyway
<Ponies47> Intresting. Maybe I should go for a laptop then :p
<OtakuTom> There's some great laptops out there.
<DashWithRainbows> Although, you should carry a mouse you can plug into it.
<Phase4> 00,02the portability is worth it
<Phase4> 00,02and if the power ever drops, it has an intergrated ups :P
<OtakuTom> I'm actually looking at one right now that would rival my gaming desktop, and it costs about $600 less than my desktop did...lol
<Ponies47> Yeah I'll have a mouse and mouse pad. Besides it's gonna be sitting on a desk as well and such. :p
<Ponies47> But my parents are devorced so I could have my computer at either house whe nI wanted to :P
<Ponies47> *when I
<DashWithRainbows> True, but what about when you go to the other house?
<OtakuTom> I love my laptops. My desktop can only be used when I'm in my room (which, granted, is fairly often with my current schedule), but whenever I'm out of the house or even my room, I have the laptop.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Microsoft Office 2013? Dear Microsoft, stop releasing more versions. It will only encourage pirating.
<Ponies47> DashWithRainbows: Like right now or when I get my new computer?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Antipirating measures? More piracy.
<DashWithRainbows> Ponies47 The new one.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Why don't companies think.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Plus, the 3DS is already hacked.
<Ponies47> DashWithRainbows: If it's laptop take it back over to the other parents house. If I get a desktop it stays at my moms whilw I use my dads desktop at his place. But then I don't have Steam and such
<DashWithRainbows> Then you see what I'm getting at. Look around for a good laptop if you plan on gaming with it.
<OtakuTom> Ponies47, I'd recommend the laptop. There's some real good ones that will last you a few years without needing any sort of upgrade (except for maybe RAM, which is still easy to upgrade on a laptop)
<Ponies47> I was think laptop. And of coarse I'm gonna get a good one. It's not gonna be the cheapest one I see, It's got last. :)
<OtakuTom> If you're gonna be playing games through Steam, I personally suggest getting a gaming laptop from ASUS. I have one that has lasted me over 3 years (got it just before Windows 7 came out and got the free upgrade) and I'm just now starting to look for a new one.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Stream is up :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> YAY
<FUS_RO_yay> So.
<Ponies47> Intresting
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: I see
<FUS_RO_yay> What are you gonna play for us?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Inb4 Rhythm Heaven
<FUS_RO_yay> Ah.
<OtakuTom> Do you have any idea as about how much you plan on spending on the computer, Ponies47?
<Ponies47> OtakuTom: Not exactly sure just yet. My dad and I are working on it.
<MahBoi777> WOO SB stream!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Let's see if this laggs...
<MadSurge> YAY
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Eeyup
<FUS_RO_yay> Total lag.
<DashWithRainbows> darn it SuperBrony64, you always stream when it's inconvinient for me.
<DashWithRainbows> So what game are you streaming right now?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm sorry :<
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Rhythm Heaven Fever

<DashWithRainbows> Because I think I've heard of it before.
<FUS_RO_yay> Someone sucks at rhythm.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hmm...
<Spell-of-Gaming> I seriously hate it when people love a parody and they don't even know the damn original. :(
<MahBoi777> SB is Rhythm pro!
<MadSurge> DashWithRainbows: there were a GBA and DS game before this. You living in europe?
<Spell-of-Gaming> GBA was Japan only. :#
<Spell-of-Gaming> :3
<MadSurge> ^
<Spell-of-Gaming> GBA game, I mean.
<Spell-of-Gaming> So, this series has Earthbound syndrome...
<MadSurge> Thanks for emulation magic!

<Phase4> 00,02night Shamroc
<MadSurge> Spell-of-Gaming: well, at least only the first never came out of Japan!
<OtakuTom> See you later, Shamroc
<Spell-of-Gaming> The original game was Japan only and the 2 sequels after it are pretty much translated.
<Ponies47> Night Shamroc
<Ponies47> OOPS! Past 4:00 AM again! :$
<FUS_RO_yay> I take back what i said, he is pretty good.

<Ponies47> Wub you guys :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> So, got the Power Portal fixed already, SuperBrony64?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yup, there's definitely a lag.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Spell-of-Gaming: No :<
<MadSurge> BA-BUM BUM BUM
<OtakuTom> You could always try splitting the video output...1 to a TV (real-time) and one to the computer for the stream (slightly lagged)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02OtakuTom: Yeah, I have that cable, but I don't know where I put it :/
<FUS_RO_yay> Man, if you want rhythm, go pick up Patapon for the psp, its like 6 bucks and its fucking awesome
*MadSurge is lurking on stream, friending ponies
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I love Patapon ^-^

<FUS_RO_yay> :D
<FUS_RO_yay> :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> MadSurge: Add me then. :3
<Spell-of-Gaming> I don't really doubt the lag is coming from my internet connection. We had an internet breakdown for 3 days.
<MahBoi777> guess I'll head to bed too, gnight bronystate! take care. Thanks for the stream SuperBrony64

<OtakuTom> holy crap that ping was loud...why must I be listening to a quiet youtube video? XD
<MadSurge> Hey alexxm!
<alexxm> hey MadSurge how've you been
<MadSurge> So I'll repeat: anyone wants an extra copy of Frozen Synapse? :D
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<OtakuTom> Hi meanwhile
<OtakuTom> Frozen Synapse?
<OtakuTom> Sounds familiar...why can't I think of it right now? XD
<OtakuTom> oyea...that game
<Meanwhile> I kinda suck at it tbh.
<OtakuTom> Yea, I'm not good at those types of games, either.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: strategic? I suck too :D
<Meanwhile> None of my ideas ever seem to work.
<Meanwhile> Flank with a shotgun? Oh don't worry the enemy rocket launcher knew you'd do that and now your brains are scattered over the wall.
<Meanwhile> I swear the ai in this game is watching me plan.
<MadSurge> is the music good at least? :D
<OtakuTom> Yea, give me any sort of mystery/puzzle solving game, instead :P
<OtakuTom> I grew up playing Tetris, Dr. Mario, and Myst
<Phase4> 00,02dinner

<MadSurge> Night SuperBrony64!
<OtakuTom> See you later, SB
<Meanwhile> Seeya SB.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: email style?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Good morning everybody
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> bye SB
<MadSurge> ohai Darkts3|Drawing|MLG!
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Yeah, players don't need to stay in the game, you can make your turn send it and it'll hold it until your opponent is online, then they can do their move and so on.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm?
<Meanwhile> Like, I just played a move in a game but the guy I'm playing isn't online, so it'll let him know it's his move when he's around and I can come back to it later.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oo Crysis 2 has a sale :3
<MadSurge> OOOH, it's like those guys who played chess through letters! :)
<Meanwhile> Yeah, exactly like that.
<MadSurge> How many moves do you have per turn anyway?
<Meanwhile> As many as you have units.
<MadSurge> Ah, okay! Like Tactics A2
<alexxm> morning Darkts3|Drawing|MLG how've you been
<RaveBrony> Such a simple chat in the morniing, i love it :)

*Midnight_Tempest flails wildly, then explodes
<RaveBrony> o_o
<MadSurge> ohai Midnight_Tempest :D
<Midnight_Tempest> <_< >_>
<RaveBrony> I think your explosion killed the chat :D
<MadSurge> Damn these 8.0/9.0 stages in Kid Icarus Uprising :[
<alexxm> MadSurge how hard are they
<OtakuTom> Meh, I just turn the difficulty back down (unless you set it to that intentionally)
<Midnight_Tempest> be a man... set the difficulty to max
<MadSurge> alexxm: basic game starts at 2.0, if you do well you might be at 4.0 by the last level :D
*Midnight_Tempest flails wildly again, then bursts into flames
<Tovler> Sagittarius Bow is awesome for KI:U single player
<alexxm> ok MadSurge so whats kid icarus uprising about then
<MadSurge> Midnight_Tempest: I'm trying to finish the levels at max :D
<OtakuTom> Yea, I'm pretty good at the game at the default difficulties, my default difficulty is getting up there on my first run.
<OtakuTom> Do any of you have the extra circle pad add-on?
<MadSurge> alexxm: angel has to defeat a dark goddess and her army of ridiculous yet lethal monsters in a pseudo-greek pantheon :D
<alexxm> MadSurge is this the game eggplant wizards from?
<XAX> Aight. I'm off the PC.
<XAX> I'll be back on my iPod later, lol.
<OtakuTom> alexxm: Sure is
<XAX> See ya'll later :>
<alexxm> thanks OtakuTom
<alexxm> bye XAX
<MadSurge> alexxm: that was the first game, Kid Icarus :D
<Midnight_Tempest> you people talk about odd games... <_< >_> im not a fan of anything Wii based... or nintendo anymore... not enough violence for me
<MadSurge> alexxm: they're in Uprising too, but they're not as annoying as they used to be... try the Tempura Wizard :D
<Tovler> I'm too much of pussy. I like the lack of violent nintendo games.
<MadSurge> Midnight_Tempest: not enough gore? :D
<alexxm> thanks MadSurge what do tempura wizards do?
<Midnight_Tempest> MadSurge: exactly...
<MadSurge> alexxm: if they hit you you become a defenseless fried shrimp, and then they try to catch you. Let them touch you, you're eaten, one hit kill.
<Midnight_Tempest> nomnom tempura is delicious
<alexxm> sounds annoying
<MadSurge> ^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> STREAM
<RaveBrony> :o
<Tovler> Tempura Attack is cheap in multiplayer
<MadSurge> alexxm: they're a rare enemy though, and the spell wears off eventually
<Phase4> 00,02not sure what do
<Meanwhile> I thought my game had randomly gained lyrics do it's soundtrack for a moment.

<Spell-of-Gaming> I guess you can keep the songs untranslated, but Jesus, can you at least translate the menus?
<Tovler> You'd think in a downloadable gaming world, we'd get more Japanese games.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> the rocket from phase pony is crashing on the top of that box
<Spell-of-Gaming> Plus, things like CoD make people think that it won't sell well.
<Spell-of-Gaming> There's a lot of Hatsune Miku fans in America, but SEGA isn't budging. :I
<Spell-of-Gaming> That's a lot of people in the Mikunopolis concert.
<Spell-of-Gaming> My computer isn't upgraded enough to play PSP games. UGH.

<MadSurge> FUS_RO_yay: just follow the plot and do missions
<FUS_RO_yay> MadSurge: Sounds semi-entertaining.
<MadSurge> FUS_RO_yay: doing the standard FPS options is only one option
<MadSurge> *routine
<FUS_RO_yay> So it could be played completely stealth?
<MadSurge> FUS_RO_yay: there's an achievement for no kills in the whole game
<FUS_RO_yay> Kinda like MGS....
<MadSurge> FUS_RO_yay: and a lot of non-lethal takedowns
<FUS_RO_yay> Yup, sounds alot like MGS.
<Phase4> 00,02what was takedown button?
<Phase4> 00,02was Q
<MadSurge> FUS_RO_yay: the original Deus Ex also had a lot of morality/faction options

<alexxm> you'd think the cyborg would be able to take more damage
<Meanwhile> I imagine bullets are probably designed to compensate for augmentations.
<alexxm> good point there Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Otherwise all the soldiers would be stuck in eternal fist-fights.
<alexxm> but you'd think the augmentions would learn to compensate for those special bullets then
<spartan133t> FALCON PAWNCH
<sub06905> funicular
<Meanwhile> There's probably only so much armour padding you can put into cybernetic limbs before they stop being useful.

<Chocobunny> Holy crap, DOOM2!
<PonyNegZero> Chocobunny: "You must be at least 13 years old to use PonyChat without parental supervision"
<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: Well good evening for you~ It's 9:40 AM for me
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase still streaming?

<AdamTheDuck> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: nah wrek is
<Chocobunny> PonyNegZero: But it was a joke. ;_;
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh
<PonyNegZero> Chocobunny: a dude in a forum got banned for a year for writing that for that exact reason
*PonyNegZero nuzzles Saturn.
<Chocobunny> PonyNegZero: But this isn't a forum.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Chocobunny: what forum?
<PonyNegZero> Chocobunny: the ToS of ponychat still requires you to be 13 or have parential supervision
<Chocobunny> Darkts3: Don't ask me, ask PonyNegZero.
*Saturn 08,01sets mode +b on *!*@k546-17-06-988.bredband.comhem.se
<Saturn> 08,01:P
<Sylandest> howdy Saturn...i think :$
<PonyNegZero> is that a 1 year ban?
<MadSurge> Hey Saturn!
<Chocobunny> PonyNegZero: But I am not 12. It' a joke.
*Saturn 08,01hugs Sylandest
<AdamTheDuck> BAN TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOON
<AttacktheAndalite> Hai Saturn~ *huggles*
*Sylandest hugs dat Saturn back "How are you, hubby?" <3
<PonyNegZero> Chocobunny: I know, but that doesn't make it not funny still
<Saturn> 08,01i didn't really ban him
<Saturn> 08,01it was just a /me
<OtakuTom> ohai saturn :)
<PonyNegZero> of course
<RobertRevenge> Which Doom is this? 1, 2 or Anthology?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> im sorry, but what are you guys talking about?
<Sylandest> RobertRevenge: 2, i believe
<Chocobunny> PonyNegZero: I thought it was funny. Now, let me ask you one thing: What the hell did you accomplish by being an ultimate buzzkill?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> RobertRevenge: guessing it is Doom 2
<PonyNegZero> Chocobunny: that was far from an ultimate buzzkill
<OtakuTom> I've never played the Doom games, but I've seen enough playthroughs...I'm about 99% sure that it's 2.
<MadSurge> Back when you had to shoot the fuck out of anything that moved and you had to rely on medkits rather than hiding like a pansy :D
<MadSurge> Yes, it's Doom 2
<Chocobunny> PonyNegZero: Whatever you are, you're a buzzkill. And the cure for buzzkills is the ignore button.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> MadSurge: Back When FPS's were challenging
<sub06905|Dead_Island> ^
<AdamTheDuck> back when a man could carry more than 2 weapons :D
<Wrek> 05and the cure for douchebags is bans
<PonyNegZero> MadSurge: don't forget the running around like your pants are on fire to dodge 1001 fireballs
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<Wrek> 05both of you behave
<MadSurge> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: exactly
<RobertRevenge> MadSurge: I never hid in Doom 3, tbh. I played it the same way I played the first 3 games.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> AdamTheDuck: ^
<MadSurge> RobertRevenge: there was another way?
<Chocobunny> Wrek: It was him that got all serious about a small joke. -.-
<AdamTheDuck> dat water texture
<AdamTheDuck> so damn sexy
<MadSurge> Dat Hell Knight death growl
<Saturn> 08,01both of you, quit it
<Saturn> 08,01end of.
<RobertRevenge> MadSurge: My dad hid behind corners and tried to lure things to come out, rather than charging in somewhere and kicking ass while taking names.
<MadSurge> Oh boy, time for mods!
<sub06905|Dead_Island> dis music
<Saturn> 08,01i need some eggs
<Chocobunny> su gud
<Saturn> 08,01brb
<Chocobunny> I need to buy this. It looks really fun.
<RobertRevenge> Dat pistol
<MadSurge> RobertRevenge: well, clearly you don't run headfirst into enemies if you don't want to die.
<RobertRevenge> Chocobunny: You can probably find an emulator of it.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Doom games did require some strategy
<Chocobunny> FPS + Strategy = Cool stuff
<RobertRevenge> MadSurge: Well, I don't mean that I would just run up and chainsaw everything. But my father played a lot more cautiously than I did.
<MadSurge> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: as in, which enemy should I kill first?
<Chocobunny> Fuck that wall.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> MadSurge: its more of, how should i kill these enemies
<RobertRevenge> Chaingun = Love
<MadSurge> RobertRevenge: exactly, only run into enemies with your BFG9000 :D
<RobertRevenge> MadSurge: Exactly :D
<Hrafn> hi everypony :)
<Chocobunny> RobertRevegne: Exactly. I just want to be a part of this conversation.
<RobertRevenge> This is making me want to boot up DoomRL
<Chocobunny> Hey, Hrafn!
<Dark_Flame> Hello
<AdamTheDuck> Night everypony, time to hit the hay.

<Chocobunny> Night, Adam.
<Sylandest> night Phase4!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Good Night Phase4 :)
<Dark_Flame> teehee here its 4 pm
<RobertRevenge> Chocobunny: If you want to try a Doom game, I recommend DoomRL if you like dungeon crawlers. It's pretty fun and the concept is the same.
<Chocobunny> Night, Phase.
<PonyNegZero> 'night Phase4.
<RobertRevenge> Chocobunny: And it's free.
<AttacktheAndalite> Night Phase4
<RobertRevenge> Phase4: Good night :3

<Saturn> 08,01i wrote a roguelike in python
<Saturn> 08,01RobertRevenge: ask whoever is streaming
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: does it come anywhere close to Nethack?
<RobertRevenge> Wrek: Do you mind if I link to the DoomRL website?
<MadSurge> ELEMENTAL PAIN D:
<Hrafn> there's just something about the graphics in old FPS games like this that makes me nauseous after a while :P
<PonyNegZero> Hrafn: you should stick with ascii games, definitely
<Hrafn> lol
<Saturn> 08,01PonyNegZero: ha, no; i wrote it literally all in a weekend
<Saturn> 08,01including a tile-based graphics engine
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: I guessed as much
<MadSurge> Hrafn: the continuous bobbing and strafing? :D
<Hrafn> yeah, it's probably that
<Hrafn> I remember when I was younger, and threw up after playing Duke Nukem 3D for too long :P
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Duke Nukem 3D was a good Fps
<RobertRevenge> Hrafn: Oh glob I loved DN3D
<Hrafn> definitely
<RobertRevenge> I wish they hadn't butchered the new Duke Nukem game :(
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> If Only Duke Nukem Forever was good
<Hrafn> I haven't tried DN Forever, but I've heard it was sort of meh
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> RobertRevenge: the problem was they tried to make the perfect game, it cost them a good development
<Saturn> 08,01my hands smell of lime still
<Saturn> 08,01zomg
<Saturn> 08,01i have to tell you why, actually

<Dumorimasoddaa> In b4 gutter mind
<Saturn> 08,01both these fruits must be ripe and sweet, or this won't work as well
<Saturn> 08,01step 3: get yourself a lime
<Saturn> 08,01step 4: cut up the pinapple and mango into chunks. slice the lime into wedges.
<MadSurge> Silly Wrek, use the chaingun! :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> MadSurge: the Super Shotgun does more dmg faster
<Saturn> 08,01step 5: squeeze th elime over the pinapple and mango
<PonyNegZero> step 6: ??? step 7: profit!
<Saturn> 08,01step 6: eat and ENJOY AN ORGASM OF FRUIT IN YOUR MOUTH
<Sylandest> :D
<Saturn> 08,01seriously, this is THE MOST AMAZING THIGN EVER
<OtakuTom> Okay, that sounds incredible
<Dumorimasoddaa> X3
<Hrafn> this sounds amazing :o
<MadSurge> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: but the chaingun is faster and stuns the enemies
<Dumorimasoddaa> You know what's also awesome
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: that actually sounds pretty yum
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn: Did you record your reaction? :D
<RobertRevenge> Saturn: It sounds about like the smoothie I make every day for breakfast
<MadSurge> BARON OF HELL D:
<Saturn> 08,01AttacktheAndalite: unfortunately, the choir of angels trumpeting in the background did not turn out on the photos
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn: Awww
<Dumorimasoddaa> Whole lime, wedge, put in glass top with crushed ice, top off with rum, crush ice into lime and enjoy

<AttacktheAndalite> Morning, FairysHuff|Dizzy
<FairysHuff|Dizzy> Sylandest Holla
<Saturn> 08,01i smell of lime, and i'm british
<Chocobunny> Saturn, you're a limey? Blimey.
*Sylandest snuggles dat FairysHuff|Dizzy
<MadSurge> I hate Barons of Hell, they waste too much ammo for their worth
<FairysHuff|Dizzy> AttacktheAndalite Monring
<Dumorimasoddaa> Rage was fun, bit of a sudden ending but fun.
<FairysHuff|Dizzy> Sylandest *Snuggles*
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> morning AttacktheAndalite

<PonyNegZero> There are 525 warnings in my code, should I be worried... nah....
<AttacktheAndalite> Morning, Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<FairysHuff|Dizzy> Sylandest I wish you could do that for real ^_^
<TheKoreanBrony1354> Rise of the traid
<Sylandest> FairysHuff|Dizzy: If I was there, I would :)
<MadSurge> Dumorimasoddaa: I hate this trend of games ending without a final boss :[
<Dumorimasoddaa> Bah
<MadSurge> LOLDED
<Dumorimasoddaa> Lack of bosses isn't the issue
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> it is about the Gameplay silly
<Dumorimasoddaa> It's lack of closure. Rage kindo has a last boss any how
<Hrafn> I've actually always disliked bosses :P
<FairysHuff|Dizzy> I dunno whats wrong with me. Maybe my meds backed up in my bodies system and just released at once.
<Chocobunny> I spy with my little eye... I can't see what that i.
<Chocobunny> *is
<RobertRevenge> Chocobunny: Air?
<Chocobunny> No, that.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> FairysHuff|Dizzy: maybe you should lie down
<Sylandest> FairysHuff|Dizzy: are you resting or lying down? Don't want you stumbling about and possibly get hurt
<Chocobunny> Thing, right there.
<Dumorimasoddaa> A ninja?
<Chocobunny> *facepaw*
<Dumorimasoddaa> It's a ninja Chocobunny
<FairysHuff|Dizzy> I'm already in bed. Been in bed all day except to go to doctors.

<PonyNegZero> FairysHuff|Dizzy: quake was fantastic
<FairysHuff|Dizzy> RobertRevenge heh
<PonyNegZero> UnFoundBug: well played.

<Wrek> 05so yeh
<Wrek> 05what to dooo
<Kandarihu> I like how DOOM gives you random messages begging you not to quit out. There's a charm to that.
<Sumica> 00,10Rawwwr
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Well Wrek, what do you want to do :)
<RobertRevenge> Wrek, mind if I link the DoomRL website?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Hello Sumica
<PonyNegZero> Wrek: have you ever tried to play nethack?
<PonyNegZero> Kandarihu: I love games that do that "___ will be very sad if you go"s and "___ orders you to stay"
<FairysHuff|Dizzy> I think I shall pass out again for a while. Hopefully this dizziness will pass.
<TrixieMuffins> a Nethack stream , that would rock
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> FairysHuff|Dizzy: get better :)
<FairysHuff|AFK> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG Thanks
<PonyNegZero> TrixieMuffins: but it would have to be narrated, or else nobody knows what's going on...
<RobertRevenge> Take Care FairysHuff|AFK
<PonyNegZero> FairysHuff|AFK: Don't die, dying is bad.
<TrixieMuffins> PonyNegZero: i know , hecould play the nethack song as well
<PonyNegZero> TrixieMuffins: which one, there are a lot...
<MadSurge> :O DOOM RPG?
<RobertRevenge> MadSurge: YES <3

<Kandarihu> Ah, I see.

<Hrafn> Zork is the one where you can get eaten by a grue, right?
<PonyNegZero> TrixieMuffins: when I get my magicbane, I scribble all over the floors~
<PonyNegZero> Hrafn: you can also get killed in nethack by grues (instadeath)
<killerpony7733> PonyNegZero: Let me guess you played that game alot before?

<alexxm> i have no idea
<Everlasting_Joy> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Ah.
<alexxm> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG whats that mean?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> alexxm: no sound im guessing
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm?
<Sylandest> what we watching?
<ponibas> oh brother where art thou?
<Sumica> 00,10new things are already made but have to proff over night
<Sylandest> ooooooh
<RobertRevenge> Lawl. "Cuddly brony/nerd seeks female for companionship and good times, please apply within."
<ponibas> great movie
<ponibas> but i have to go to work :(
<derpy_pony> the mel brooks movie started like this
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm Musicals for Prisons?
<derpy_pony> what is this?
<RobertRevenge> They should never have gotten rid of chain gangs.
<Everlasting_Joy> derpy_pony: :D That's a good point.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ponibas: could you tell me what this movie is before you leave?
<Waffles> this movie is interesting T^T
<ponibas> i guessed it was Oh Broter, where art thou
<Sylandest> This movie is "O Brother, Where Art Thou"
<PonyNegZero> I watched this in my college english class - I wrote an awesome essay regarding the music of this.
<Sylandest> as it says on screen
<OtakuTom> I love this movie :D
<derpy_pony> k...some attempt at humour
<Sumica> 00,10funy thing about movies that just start. they tend to say the title when they start
<ponibas> I gotta get me some Dapper Dan monies :P
<RobertRevenge> Oh god, I remember this song from my childhood <3
<ponibas> i guessed by the pick axe sounds :D
<derpy_pony> spoiler rules, Sumica
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> this seems enjoyable :)
<derpy_pony> chicken thieves
<Waffles> poor chicken
<derpy_pony> looks like I missed the title
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> derpy_pony: O Brother where art thou
<derpy_pony> erm...
<derpy_pony> you are eaten by a manticore
<Everlasting_Joy> Didn't expect to see this, but I'm o.k. with it.
<ponibas> lol, gunna watch this part before i go
<OtakuTom> I'm always amused when movies try to put the title somewhere inside the dialogue (doesn't count in some cases, such as most superhero movies or ones where the title is from where the movie takes place, like The Matrix)
<AttacktheAndalite> What's this movie about? I've never seen it?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> rofl
<ponibas> cya!
<derpy_pony> tries to be funny

<RobertRevenge> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Not all the time though, my grandfather is pretty ignorant >_>
<alexxm> well they put all they're points in wisdom don't they
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> RobertRevenge: well, most ppl
<derpy_pony> the old people I know are just assholes....they talk all the time knowing that you are politely trying like you listen
<derpy_pony> +to look
<alexxm> run away
<Waffles> a brave boy
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Children sure are our future :)
<derpy_pony> they walk over your foot with their walking frame...and they know that you apologize for it...even after the second time
<Sumica> 00,10daddy dont give enough fuck to go see why the boy is shooten
<RobertRevenge> derpy_pony: I live next to an octagenerian like that.
<derpy_pony> when I am in this age, I will use and abuse all these privilegues ^^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> derpy_pony: hehe
<RobertRevenge> derpy_pony: I probably will as well.
<Hrafn> when I'm old, I will only ever pay in small coins whenever I go shopping
<derpy_pony> haha
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Hrafn: rofl
<RobertRevenge> Hrafn: Pay in pennies!
<Hrafn> :P

<OtakuTom> So now here's something to think about...if the ammo was strong enough to go through that metal, how did it not go through the wood of the barn?
<RobertRevenge> OtakuTom: Movie magic

<Hrafn> wooden walls are about as bulletproof as styrofoam :P

<AttacktheAndalite> Quick_Thinker:Why do you think that?
<killerpony7733> Quick_Thinker: Or he has encountered life problems
<Kandarihu> I guess I have some time to mull things other about the GTA pack. The reason why I'm thinking twice about it is because I'm not the sort of person to play games as the bad guy. I probably won't enjoy it as much as others do.
<Quick_Thinker> red spy is in the base
<Lil_B> don't buy Stronghold 3 on Steam today, its the most horrible and broken game I have ever played... (just warning because its on sale on steam)

<magmablock> The door is augmented
<killerpony7733> Lil_B: Stronghold 1 and crusader was the best of them
*MegaMoonShine hugs AttacktheAndalite Waffles and valoreins|Drawing
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst I heard that was broken too, but at least it got fixed... Stronghold 3 is still awful
<GarrettBrony> Hey guys

<Lil_B> Dark_Horst oh, what are the issues with it?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Good job Quick_Thinker!
<GarrettBrony> Lil_B its the chance for Ponie Fan games to get a console release
<DeadMau5> It was a hard choice
<tigher1001> what game is this
<Quick_Thinker> what do i win :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Me!
<Quick_Thinker> yAY
<killerpony7733> derpy_pony: I see all ponies as equal due to unique traits, Everything comes down to preference and if you see yourself in them
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01For 10 seconds.
<tigher1001> what game is this
<pony_359> except rarity
<MegaMoonShine> tigher1001: Deus Ex
<Eulshy> bug
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: the best thing is how the actual system requirements are at least three times as high as what'S written on the package. my system should have no trouble running it at all, but itÄs anything else than fluid. and it doesnt even have anti aliasing
<Wrek> 05you can seel waht you dont need at the gastation sumi
<Eulshy> big
<pony_359> just kidding

<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: oh, and they release patches like very other week. i still see no prgoress
<Dark_Horst> last time these fuckers got any money from me
<Dark_Horst> they make ea look like saints with that stunt
<GarrettBrony> who in here wants to mess with future archeologist?
<DeadMau5> Twilight: Most likely to succeed
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst same with Stronghold 3, but the Grafics are even at highest settings awful (it just isn't well deigned) the music are reused songs from Stronghold 1
<Eulshy> Illegal stuff
<DeadMau5> Fluttershy: Most
<Quick_Thinker> now Dark anger is not needed just say you want be buying thier products and make a firm clam collective comment and it works much better
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hey ponies
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm back
<DeadMau5> Friendly
<MahBoi777> hey Very_Silly_Filly
<Very_Silly_Filly> So many tramps
<Quick_Thinker> sup Very_Silly_Filly
<killerpony7733> derpy_pony: Uhuh? can't change my mind on that, All ponies are equal no one is the best. It always comes down to if you can relate to certain ponies :P
<DeadMau5> Rainbow Dash: Most popular
<MegaMoonShine> Ohai Very_Silly_Filly :)
<GarrettBrony> Very_Silly_Filly correction Cyborg Tramps. ya know cause its Deus Ex
<Eulshy> punk sent me
<Quick_Thinker> i can relate to Twi and apparently in Fluttershys well shyness
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst it takes forever to load, nothing is balanced, its slow, but only because they made the animation and generally movment slow... they patched it so everything is faster now...
<GarrettBrony> Quick_Thinker: same here
<derpy_pony> killerpony7733: and who can relate to background ponies like rainbow dash?
<DeadMau5> AppleJack: Most dependable, Most athletic
<Eulshy> hehehe
<Eulshy> Dogmentation
<Quick_Thinker> your plan is genuis
<GarrettBrony> Screw Copyright I have Creative Commons
<Eulshy> I'd kill him for that
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: and the people who sell us that garbage suddenly wonder why their games get downloaded
<Quick_Thinker> must copy right my name before its too late
<DeadMau5> Rarity: Most beautiful
<killerpony7733> derpy_pony: RD is loyalty in her element and she values friendship and never wants to fail her friends?
<DeadMau5> Pinkie Pie : Most Outgoing
*Quick_Thinker writes down a cop write for his name and is told to wait a month until approval

<MegaMoonShine> Oh, hey xxMoopyxx and BronyInstrumental
<Eulshy> Tovler: mines level 48
<xxMoopyxx> eeyup
<Quick_Thinker> oh my Celestia there is a game called DEFCON everypony DESTROY WOPR
<killerpony7733> Alchemist: Exactly, Every mane six and some background pony has unique traits and usually a way to relate to them
<GarrettBrony> mmm Whopper
<Very_Silly_Filly> GarrettBrony: WOPR?
<Tovler> aw fuck, A Tangrowth! Fly away!!!
<GarrettBrony> yep
<DeadMau5> MMM Double Whoppa
<GarrettBrony> get to the WOPR!
<Quick_Thinker> well killer there is one element almost no normal human can relate to Twilights Magic
<DeadMau5> true story
<Quick_Thinker> i wish i could but well its near impossible to use it
<DeadMau5> *raises glass*
<Quick_Thinker> however we cant acess all of our brains so who knows
<GarrettBrony> Quick_Thinker: except Friendship is Magic. so if A human expresses friendship to his fellow man. he is magical
<killerpony7733> Quick_Thinker: Actually, If you noticed what it's meant to relate to is a friend who clues a group of friends together rather then just *magic*
<Saturn> 08,01Quick_Thinker: if we can't use all of our brains, would you be happy for part of yours to be cut out?
<Quick_Thinker> no
<cratorkid> friendship= magic
<DeadMau5> woah! no violence!
<Quick_Thinker> we may unlock it one day
<Saturn> 08,01then i think maybe you don't believe that we don't use all of our brains.

<Quick_Thinker> ^ what are you talking about
<Tovler> Woobat evolved into Quagsire
<Alchemist> killerpony7733: well Im not really talking about unique traits but that the traits they have are not absolute. If they had traits they'd adhere to no matter what the show would get 100% predictable quite fast.
<derpy_pony> CrimsonPhoenix: they popped up on taobao a while ago

<Very_Silly_Filly> Not really
<Tovler> spoiling a non-serial series. *shrugs*

<killerpony7733> Quick_Thinker: Strait up fighter
<GarrettBrony> thats the password to my luggages
<killerpony7733> straight*
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Meanwhile: moopy never tabs nicks so dim would be the answer
<Eulshy> 1: Rob people. 2: Get their credits. 3: Spend credits on aug kits. 4: Profit
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Makes sense.
<Quick_Thinker> run and gun huh i like it
<killerpony7733> Sumica: Take the stun gun and sell it

<xxMoopyxx> *Cans.wave*
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> TORB:
<Eulshy> take stun gun and sell it
<GarrettBrony> TORB like this
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> TORB: when you say their name
<Eulshy> TORB
<TORB> Ah.
<killerpony7733> TORB: Type enough of their name and tab then it auto completes
<Eulshy> Dance pony dance
<TORB> So... Sumica.
<Meanwhile> Und dann TORB got all the pings.
<Eulshy> How do you make your inventory bigger?

<Very_Silly_Filly> It ish Jensen,
<Very_Silly_Filly> Not Jenson Button
<TORB> Eulshy, I didn't do it 1000 times, though.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> is Sumi still doing Dick Jensen?
<GarrettBrony> Sumica does Jensen Like wearing sunglasses at night so he can keep track of the visions in his eyes?
<alexxm> i think so
<Kandarihu> rockytoppie85, it's more of a story-based game. The main object isn't clear until the end. And even then, it can vary widely based on how you play.
<Quick_Thinker> hey everypony i have some strange news i got my dad to watch an episode of MLP FIM while played games and he said he hated it but when i went to sleep i heard the theme play again down stair so i think he like is :D
<Meanwhile> At night.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Quick_Thinker: good for you

<GarrettBrony> A shotgun is always handy sumi
<MegaMoonShine> Quick_Thinker: That was actually kinda how I felt when first watching it
<Wrek> 05its crap
<killerpony7733> Sumica: Nah SMG is eh tbh AR gets further then SMG
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i'd try to make my dad into a brony, but so far he's sorta a troll and i try not to bring him to pony stuff
<TORB> Sumica, where is that guy on the map?
<Eulshy> Lets go rob more people!!!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> GTA is 75% off today :d
<Quick_Thinker> Dark my dad made fun of me for watching it and now i think i got him to like it just power through the hate and it will pay off
<Kandarihu> No. It's just something where the story dictates where you go and what you do. And how you handle the dialog trees affects the story.
<TORB> I'll have to look next time I play.
<xxMoopyxx> Hey sumica need a dispencer here!
<Eulshy> Since when do stun guns shoot darts?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> -_(\
<killerpony7733> Sumica: But as wrek told you upgrade the AR as much as possible get laser pointer for pin point accuracy and everything else to make it a walking death cannon

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03That's why my ping is too annoying~
<Very_Silly_Filly> I found a game called rapelay. How creative
<Very_Silly_Filly> Scoot-Scootaloo: Word.
<rockytoppie85> how you change your ping sound?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> aww yeah its bacon time
<killerpony7733> Sumica: Uh as i can't remember which try checking those you can
<PonyNegZero> Scoot-Scootaloo: but it is always bacon time...
<xxMoopyxx> hey sumica whats that dudes name when he was changing his name?
<Eulshy> Not even trash in those cans
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Yes... yes it is.
<Kandarihu> rockytoppie85, he doesn't use the same IRC client as the one on the site.
<rockytoppie85> okay
<GarrettBrony> Sumica In Soveit Equestria Pings Kick You
<Eulshy> Say what you want about the city but thet certainly empty their trash cans
<killerpony7733> Sumica: I know the 2nd trader is in one of the alleyway apartments
<Kandarihu> mIRC supports custom ping sounds. Oh, how I abused that when I used that program.
<cow334> hello every one
<AttacktheAndalite> Hello, cow334
<xxMoopyxx> hey cow334
<MegaMoonShine> hello cow334 :)
<rockytoppie85> cow334: hello

<PonyNegZero> Quick_Thinker: has your palm passed through your head yet?
<Eulshy> Nuke?
<AttacktheAndalite> Quick_Thinker: It's that bad?
<Quick_Thinker> yep
<MegaMoonShine> Quick_Thinker: I fasedesked so hard it went through the floor
<Eulshy> Why you no nuke them?
<Quick_Thinker> they are so uneducated and look at the strange thing of the fanbase like cloppers and people who live at home
<Kandarihu> Back when I was downloading Kaizoku Fansubs' releases of One Piece, I'd have a highlight for the text that comes up whenever they announced a new release on their IRC. I had it set to play a song from the series in it's entirety. This song starts strong from the very beginning. So that way, I can drop everything no matter what.
<GarrettBrony> is Sumica trying to acsess the WOPR?
<xxMoopyxx> dat phone ring
<Tovler> Pennsylvania? Was howard stern interviewing bronies at Anthrocon?
<Eulshy> TLDR
<cow334> who is streaming

<Quick_Thinker> they say we need a celebratiy front when we have Tara and others
<cow334> ahh okay thanks ponibas
<Eulshy> Nuke them
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> question Sumica , is the slight jumpyness everynow and then cause of game resource intensity while streaming

<Kandarihu> Interestingly, both otakon and I are in the USA. I tried using a website to trace the location of mips.tv and it says it's in the Netherlands. But not in any city that speedtest.net has nodes in.
<Quick_Thinker> okay does any one know the adress of howard stern cause im gonna go love and tolerate him to the moon
<Tovler> I'm bored. I'm gonna test the kick thingy

<Eulshy> Spam 100% detection
<killerpony7733> Sumica: Could try blitz gacking it like fortifying things quick and capturing just as quick
<Quick_Thinker> and howard stern is love tolerated to not just the moon but to jupiters moon
<cow334> Kandarihu: aah okay then thanks
<xxMoopyxx> Hey sumica you should ask the person to get kicked ask him say hey whats the shape of italty a kick
<AttacktheAndalite> Tovler: I think it kicks you as soon as you press "enter" to send your 6th message

<rockytoppie85> people who realy wanna keep something hidden
<Eulshy> Pretty
<PonyNegZero> pro tip, don't make mines that obvious...
<rockytoppie85> ya :P
<Kandarihu> Chocobunny, someone who probably expects enemies to come to their apartment more than he himself would.
<Chocobunny> Unnr|Work: I heard that the landmine museum is really blowing up in the media.
<rockytoppie85> xD
<rockytoppie85> lol choco
<Unnr|Work> pro-er tip: Make mines that obvious, but then set them up as motion triggers for the real mines
<Quick_Thinker> landmine musuem is best musuem
<rockytoppie85> what is a nuke virus>
<Eulshy> Shotgun shells sweet
<MadSurge> Chocobunny: Ba dum tshh :D

<Quick_Thinker> ^ where is it even at?
<rockytoppie85> xD
<Chocobunny> Quick_Thinker: Somewhere above USA.
<Barbetos|Atwork> Poor tweaker
<rockytoppie85> your going dow- ded
<Quick_Thinker> oh well good luck finding it
<Quick_Thinker> and also we cant decorate it with clouds we are not pegasus so we cant hold clouds sadly
<RobertRevenge> That was back in the 50s though, I wonder if it's still there D:
<Quick_Thinker> also the city has plasmids so we could theroaticly hold clouds and be a magical human
<Wrek> 05i accidentaly my whole computer
<Spectrum_Rush|AFK> ehhehhahah
<Quick_Thinker> lets go find that city NOW
<RobertRevenge> Plasmids are addictive though, what will you do if you turn into a tweaker?

<Bronysith> when i was 9 i played it for the first time
<Very_Silly_Filly> Also Dragon quest 8
<BronyInstrumental> when i was 11 i first played it
<Very_Silly_Filly> I played Mario 64 at 2 years old
<Alchemist> I was older than that (maybe 16-17) but i loved the story and the gameplay as well.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I played Quake 3 at the age of 4 :3
<Quick_Thinker> yes alexxm i had one great memory of the underwater level and had a flashback to my childhood i cried nostalic tears
<Very_Silly_Filly> Quick_Thinker: Burn. That. Underwater. Level.
