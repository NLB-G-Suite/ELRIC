*MysteryPony starts dancing!
<oni_link> They should do an ENG version for Season 3 or a JAP version
<RoboGanjalf> Italia was like: Srew you! We can make our own intro! With blackjack and hookers!
<MadSurge> Italian opening remade completely :D

<hen3ry> why wouldn't they be ok with it?
<Sabershy> Wow, I gotta had to Italy.
<Kandarihu> The song is nice, but it's a friggin' clips episode.
<lowfn> Bronies should invent a Brony Language
<MysteryPony> SO AWSOME
<MadSurge> Sabershy: waiting for you then :D
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Still so epic
<Kandarihu> Er, a clips opening.
<bronybucket> CRPT MUS DINT FLARBEL?

<lowfn> P0N-3: Drinking what?
<hen3ry> it's more important to be drunk enough to sing loud, than it is to hit the note.
<Lunar_Brony> P0N-3 that should serve you a good hangover
<FlutterShy2000> y r we watching this
<Kandarihu> As much as I'd like Hasbro to outdo this, I know that they're going to have something no longer than 30 seconds for the opening, and prominantly feature the lyrics "My Little Pony, My Little Pony".
<CECtheRonin> Stay on key, Italian sea ponies!
*Dark_of_Max wut?

<Jmo4267> It doesn't seem phase minds and lowfn is only doing it a little bit.
<killerpony7733> I have no hate for it, But it gets annoying in a place where it's not mean't to be around
*lowfn roleplays around killerpony7733 's face

<Phase4> 00,02aparently my internet died
<Kammerjunk> lowfn: orly
<Jmo4267> Technically there is no rule saying he CAN'T rp
<MysteryPony> lowfn: it goes under Do not spam!
<Phase4> 00,02there we go
<lowfn> Well it wasnt excessive
<Phase4> 00,02fredrick is in orbit
<lowfn> :P
<Kammerjunk> Of course, "excessive" is a subjective term.
<Jmo4267> Exactly.
<Phase4> 00,02i can rescue him later
<Jmo4267> So quit picking on him you party poopers.
<Phase4> 00,02you guys getting stream?
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Still it's mostly considered a bit annoying when people do more then say /hug *somepony*
<Jmo4267> Forever buffer.
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: But less uncomfortable than hugging.
*MysteryPony hugs killerpony7733!
<MysteryPony> killerpony7733: i agree
*lowfn dusts killerpony7733 's toes as a way to say sorry

<Phase4> 00,02i'ma do that
<Spectrum_Rush> so KSP has rover parts now Phase4 ?

<Spectrum_Rush> ah
<MadSurge> Wrek: excellent! :$
*MadSurge has never played Future Cop LAPD
<Jmo4267> Wow?
<Jmo4267> Really?
<Jmo4267> That game is the bomb.
<killerpony7733> Alpha-Omega-Prime: What interests me is that since the wonderbolts usually make sure of good weather and what not, Would the shadowbolts be their counter part and make sure for bad weather?
<MadSurge> Jmo4267: heard so, yeah :D
<Jmo4267> You should really consider giving it a play, it is amazing. Expecially multiplayer.
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: well, bad weather isn't a strictly bad thing
<Jmo4267> They should make a re-boot or such for it. Would be wicked.
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: You get the meaning though :P
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: of course
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Well the wonder bolts leave a trail of thunder clouds so I'm going to get back to you on that one. Plus they supervised a hurricane in an episode so I guess it depends
<killerpony7733> Alpha-Omega-Prime: Again i really wish they explained who and what the shadowbolts do considering they are mean't to be legendary
<Phase4> 00,02i keep accidentally taking off
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Hopefully they will be the antagonists in season 3 or else we probably won't hear anything about them
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Or a later season
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Welcome [SWAG]Haku
<Firelight> UUGH. Out of dubstep.

<BronyInstrumentl|art> and no, AdamTheDuck what i had was a sausage, egg and cheese MUFFIN
<AdamTheDuck> What that's a normal breakfast in my opinon, what the hell have you been eating before that?
<BronyInstrumentl|art> cereals mostly
<AdamTheDuck> Well there's nothing wrong with cereal, unless they're one of those sugary corn flakes :/
<BronyInstrumentl|art> less corn flakes, more frosties.....plus more sugar
<AdamTheDuck> There is never enough sugar in those cereals... :D
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm that came worded out differntly than I intended
<AdamTheDuck> There is never too much sugar. That's more like it
<BronyInstrumentl|art> i keep making random revisions of my OC like hairstyle and colour schemes but i can't decide which ones to go with :/
<AdamTheDuck> Just add more duct tape.
<AdamTheDuck> Words that I live by. :D
<BronyInstrumentl|art> and i can't draw a stallion's muzzle either, so it constantly looks female
<BronyInstrumentl|art> wise words there
<Kammerjunk> Duct tape - If it breaks, it doesn't.
<BronyInstrumentl|art> ohai Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> So I was looking at a scale map of the known universe the other day.
<Kammerjunk> Makes me feel a bit small.
<AdamTheDuck> Autobots, transform and roll out!
<AdamTheDuck> Well brb.
<BronyInstrumentl|art> why is chat always so damn quiet at this time?
<MysteryPony> Who killed the chat??
<BronyInstrumentl|art> i mean sure it's 6AM for americans so that's why THEY're not here but what about everywhere else?
<TheRandomkid321> No people hit by cars today ^_
<MegaMoonShine> Afternoon everypony :)
<BronyInstrumentl|art> 'Noon, MegaMoonShine!
<Buytoast> it's not noon you deluded weasel slapper
<MegaMoonShine> >.>
<BronyInstrumentl|art> Buytoast depends on where you are. where i am it's 1PM so technically, it's afternoon
<Jmo4267> The hell?
<Jmo4267> deluded weasel slapper?
<Buytoast> well then your clock is wrong
<Jmo4267> How did you come up with that.
<Vordox> This game looks like LAPD for Playstation
<BronyInstrumentl|art> Buytoast look up GMT
<Buytoast> the only time i need to know is time for america to shine again
<Vordox> Oh
<Vordox> IT IS THE SAME GAME. <3
<AdamTheDuck> Lol Future Cop LAPD
<BronyInstrumentl|art> Buytoast EST is GMT - 7. it's currently 6:06 EST. so it's 1:06 GMT, in england
<MegaMoonShine> So who is playing right now?
<Jmo4267> Wrek is.
<MegaMoonShine> Thought so
<MegaMoonShine> Why's everyone so quiet all of a sudden?
<BronyInstrumentl|art> idk
<BronyInstrumentl|art> any of you guys ever play spore, that PC game about evolution?
<Jmo4267> Doing stuff I guess.
<Jmo4267> Spore is a great game.
<killerpony7733> Well it's like 2:10 PM here around europe and night or very early morning in the US
<MegaMoonShine> Never played that myself
<BronyInstrumentl|art> yeah, i have the GA expansion pack for spore, once you get to the space stage it's so tedious without it
<Jmo4267> Heh.
<BronyInstrumentl|art> what's your favourite stage of spore?
<Jmo4267> I like the tribal stage.
<Jmo4267> Creature/tribal stage. Both fun.
<BronyInstrumentl|art> heh, my favourite's the civilisation cause you can just be a jerk to everyone with that megabomb thing at the end
<Jmo4267> Mm
<MegaMoonShine> Lol
<BronyInstrumentl|art> although the space stage is pretty fun too
<BronyInstrumentl|art> espacially when you get the anti-matter bombs. those kick ass
<AdamTheDuck> I had more fun making stuff in spore than actually playing the game xD
<BronyInstrumentl|art> yeah, making stuff is fun too
<BronyInstrumentl|art> i wonder if there's a multiplayer spore?
<AdamTheDuck> Well there was that Dark Spore or something
<Jmo4267> Closest to that is Darkspore
<AdamTheDuck> but it looks horrible
<Jmo4267> Hey!
<Jmo4267> It's a good game.
<AdamTheDuck> Just from first glance
<BronyInstrumentl|art> never heard of it. gonna look it up
<AdamTheDuck> I haven't tried it though so my opinion doesn't mean much
<[iPad]JRP2234> New song
<AdamTheDuck> Just from gameplay videos, it seems very bland
<[iPad]JRP2234> Let's start a argument ......dubstep *me runs
<AdamTheDuck> Save all zee humans!
<MegaMoonShine> [iPad]JRP2234: New song of what?
<[iPad]JRP2234> It's on me soundcloud
<MegaMoonShine> Kewl :)
*AdamTheDuck still has no idea what makes dubstep... well... dubstep. :S
<AdamTheDuck> Damn so much buffer!
<MegaMoonShine> I'm buffering too :(
<killerpony7733> ^
<MegaMoonShine> How many robots are gonna come out of that thing?!
<MegaMoonShine> Infinite enemy robot dispenser!
<Kandarihu> Hmm, what game is this?
<AdamTheDuck> Made of duct tape!
<MegaMoonShine> Kandarihu: Future Cop LAPD

<killerpony7733> Wrek: Oh is the game done? :D
<AdamTheDuck> GAME OVER MAN, GAME OVER!
<MegaMoonShine> How anticlimactic...
<AdamTheDuck> Dat cheesy music
<MegaMoonShine> Wait...
<AdamTheDuck> SOI SOI SOI
<MegaMoonShine> That was a gameplay VIDEO?
<AdamTheDuck> WUUUUUUUUUT
<killerpony7733> ^My reaction
<AdamTheDuck> Y U TROLL US WREK
<Kandarihu> It's ragtime music. It's not cheesy. It's just a style from a bygone era.
<AdamTheDuck> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<MegaMoonShine> Still a better ending than ME3
<Kandarihu> Is Wrek streaming?
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: I think so,
<Jmo4267> Oh how many times I see that MegaMoonShine.
<MegaMoonShine> Jmo4267: I know that feel
<killerpony7733> Jmo4267: The joke is the equivelent of like saying ''Still a better love story then twillight''
<MadSurge> Oh what? That was a longplay?!
<Jmo4267> You don't say killerpony7733.
<AdamTheDuck> Yes MadSurge, Wrek trolled us all.
<killerpony7733> wrek is master troll
<AdamTheDuck> So convincing when he said "I hate this level"
<AdamTheDuck> He was so*
<Kandarihu> So he made us think he was playing that?
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: I was playing, whatevs :D
<MegaMoonShine> Where is he now?
<killerpony7733> Hm maybe i shall play some tribes ascend while we wait
<MegaMoonShine> He's just sitting back, forcing us to watch this boring screen
<killerpony7733> Only about 28k xp away from affording a new weapon
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm what to do...
<killerpony7733> I'm maybe leaning on playing some tribes ascend

<Obsidian> so much plot
<StinkomanFan> ARE YOU FUCKING RETARDED
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Where's Rainbow Dash?
<ponyfromPR> NO
<mishia> ok its going down the drain
<sonicandmario85> why are the moderators so cruel to their bronys?
<Braviary> Mmm.
<StinkomanFan> Please, no Rainbow Dash
<mishia> it went rom acceptible to shitty
<Michael> no RD no
<AttacktheAndalite> Nittany_Discord, she doesn't come in till another half season
<mishia> YEP ITS SHITTY NOW
<JESmith71> That's G3 for you
<StinkomanFan> ALL THE CHARM BRACELETS
<mishia> Nittany_Discord: it was ok in the begining, and now its devolped to shittyness
<owlicious> 4 bracelets? That's too many
<Braviary> She's getting off to food.
<Braviary> It's Pinkie Pie!
<owlicious> what? That's under 9000!

<Michael> wtf

<ponyfromPR> make it stop
<StinkomanFan> Imagine going to a birthday and getting FIVE CHARM BRACELETS AND NOTHING ELSE
<Braviary> Scootaloo has Sparkle in her name?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There's Rainbow Dash!
<mishia> NOOOO
<Michael> noooooo
<StinkomanFan> FFFFFFF-
<owlicious> ALWAYS STYLISH
<Michael> kill it with fire
<mishia> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Lasharus> The production value of this thing appears to have been approximately 12 cents and a stick of chewing gum.
<Spectrum_Rush> Nittany_Discord: false wrong LIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And look at that plot!
<mishia> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Obsidian> Paused on plot
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: Dat plot
<Braviary> HAHAHAHA
<sonicandmario85> RAINBOW DASH WAS LIKE RARITY IT SEEMS
<Shooeie> RD wasnt RD back then
<mishia> note: this isnt disrepecting rainbowdash because as you can tell by her cutie mark, its more of the cutsey rainbow and not the MOTHERBUCKING SONICRAINBOOM rainbow
<mishia> so her name fits
<JESmith71> Right down to Rarity using G3 RD's "Darling"
<mishia> her voice is wonderful
<Jmo4267> This is too entertaining.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's about rainbows, darling.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Remember that.
<mishia> the hair mixing is nice too
<Braviary> Nam was hell, Rainbow Dash.
<Michael> nope
<mishia> PINKIE O_O
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And Pinkie Pie!
<Michael> that's not pinkie
<StinkomanFan> And Guess what SHE'S getting her
<Braviary> How is she holding that balloon?
<AJTheMightyGamer> oh rainbow dash... wat did they do to you? :'(
<StinkomanFan> ALL THE BRACELETS
<mishia> so all she knows how to do is do ballons? shittyass talent
<MysteryMaid> Mlp g4 is just like Hotdogs! there tasty, but you dont want to se what it looked like befor it was a hotdog!!!!
<Braviary> Charm bracelets must be the Ponyland equivalent to anal beads, considering how they're getting off to just the idea.
<Shooeie> I thought numbers were forbidden?
<Spectrum_Rush> nice analogy
<mishia> XD
<Braviary> She, nip it in the butt, they are anal beads!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bracelet emergency! Fetch the Elements of Harmony.
<mishia> note: minty was my favriote doll
<StinkomanFan> Seriously, that'd be the shittiest birthday ever.
<Obsidian> The only idea they could come up with is bracelets?
<Kandarihu> I hope the guy streaming (and yes, I know who it is) doesn't take that ping sound back to his old computer once it's fixed. I fear that ping sound
<Braviary> *brohoof*
<StinkomanFan> >Clever
<StinkomanFan> HAHAHHAHAAAAAAAAAAA
<ponyfromPR> Braviary: *return brohoof*
<StinkomanFan> close enough
<mishia> -.(\
<Winter_Shadowhooves> amirite in thinking this is g2?
<StinkomanFan> G2 was tolerable
<Braviary> Everyone who has stayed, I commend you for your Bravery. This makes you tougher.
<StinkomanFan> This is G3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This is G3.
<derpy_pony> just got back in
<Winter_Shadowhooves> minty is best pony
<Michael> this is profesional torture
<Bronysith> the animation is god awful
<StinkomanFan> Kimono's kind of a bitch
<JESmith71> Nope G3. G2 didn't have a cartoon (Tales was G1.5)
<Kandarihu> Winter_Shadowhooves, the only G2 media was the PC game Friendship Gardens. This is G3
<Winter_Shadowhooves> g3.5 is worst
<derpy_pony> what did I miss so far?
<Winter_Shadowhooves> Ive seen this before
<Braviary> Why do they keep positioning their bodies and acting like they're being fucked?
<Michael> hai derpy_pony
<MysteryMaid> Braviary: I started this! i cant see god bronies fall becous of my stupidity! im here to the last man falls!
<Winter_Shadowhooves> G2 had cars
<Winter_Shadowhooves> and schools
<derpy_pony> g3 had no sonic nukes and no twilight gatling cannons
<Winter_Shadowhooves> and shipping
<derpy_pony> hey Michael :)
<Braviary> But G3 had Sunny Daze, are you saying Sunny Daze isn't awesome?
<JESmith71> Winter_Shadowhooves that wasn't G2. That was G1.5.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> oh
<Kandarihu> Braviary, this is the ugly side of western animation. Don't expect to see any part of talking ponies to ever hold still for long.
<Shooeie> The Mare 6 looks out of line.......
<Kammerjunk> This is what I return to.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Damn those Rainbows.
<Kammerjunk> I like.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> G4 > G1 > G1.5 > G3 >G3.5
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah!

<Jim> where would you put G2 in that?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Still want to go on?

<Obsidian> and now random dancing
<Braviary> Let's go to the end!
<Winter_Shadowhooves> so...wrong
<Kammerjunk> Jim: I think G2 = G1.5 there.
<Michael> Winter_Shadowhooves: sir, thats true
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There's 7 more minutes of this.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> g1 is best old gen
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: Go for it,

<Winter_Shadowhooves> this would be good in g4

<StinkomanFan> OH GOD
<pony_1471> LMAO
<Kandarihu> Ren and Stimpy and everything else done by it's creator (forgot his name) has painstaking detail put towards it's audio. No digitally stored audio samples. IIRC, all sfx were done on a soundstage. Much less lossy.
<Michael> wtflol
<Dragonmatte> :O
<BESTPONE> oh jesus'
<JESmith71> Because this was made when Clinton was in office
<Kandarihu> And that's the only thing I like about it.... at all.

<Winter_Shadowhooves> yes

<Braviary> He's gonna stick his weiner in her marshmallow.
<Malavolent> The wat is strong with this one.
<MadSurge> Ren and Stimpy had some fine animared lassies
<Kandarihu> Winter_Shadowhooves, it's the basis of the American government, mainly how it's supposed to be structured.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> ah
<mishia> Winter_Shadowhooves: Americans setting of the basic laws we all follow
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ren and Stempy is the ONLY cartoon where you will see all orignal animation.

<StinkomanFan> We need to stream Grim Adventures
<mishia> Kandarihu: they were afraid that they would have another monarchy, so the americans greatly limited govermental powers
<JESmith71> Why does it have to be a Games episode? Show an original Spumco one while John was still around
<StinkomanFan> WOOO BOOT CAMP!
<MadSurge> StinkomanFan: agreed! :)
<Shooeie> Wasnt this show censored?
<Michael> wtf
<mishia> oh shit
<Kandarihu> Speaking of American presidents, I'm having a Steam problem. This game I pre-ordered is supposed to unlock, but it's not unlocking.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This show was not censored.
<Braviary> Cut the crap.
<Malavolent> German ladies are scary.
<Michael> dat animation

<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: that's why it's awesome :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> Bald girl is hot.
<mishia> Nittany_Discord: not censored? what do you mean??
<StinkomanFan> I'd hit it
<StinkomanFan> with an axe
<Braviary> They censored it later on, mishia.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It ran for a few seasons.
<mishia> Braviary: thats badass O_o
<MadSurge> mishia: that anything risquè made it all in :D

<mishia> MadSurge: ren and stimpy liked to be risque'
<Winter_Shadowhooves> what animals are these guys?
<StinkomanFan> ALL THE COOKIES
<Kandarihu> My standard litmus test for a good art style in animation is whether the girls can be cute. If all the girls are ugly, it fails my standard.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Are you tough enough to be a girl scout chat?
<MadSurge> mishia: so awesome :D
<Braviary> I am not tough enough. -_-
<Dark_Horst> Winter_Shadowhooves: the red one is a cat, the other a rat

<Sabershy> Nittany_Discord: Isn't being a Brony enough? :$

<StinkomanFan> I'm trying to imagine Fluttershy's reaction to this show
<JESmith71> It was even more risque when they did Adult Party Cartoon...which only had one episode I liked (Altruists)
<Michael> dat text wall
<AttacktheAndalite> dat kick
<mishia> 0_____0
<Winter_Shadowhooves> adult party canon?

<MadSurge> NOOOOOO
<Michael> hai Chrysalis
<JESmith71> Actually Winter_Shadowhooves Ren's accent isn't Mexican. It's supposed to be a Peter Lorre impression
<mishia> oh shit america
<Lil_B> hi Chrysalis
<AttacktheAndalite> hai Chrysalis
<ponyfromPR> hi Chrysalis
<MadSurge> They dead
<Michael> Shizuka: Sweet :)
<StinkomanFan> WELCOME TO AMERICA
<Braviary> When the show got cancelled, Winter_Shadowhooves, Spike tried to pick it up and make it strictly for adults.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Shizuka.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> http://derpy.me/pYhZ6
<Braviary> It got cancelled after 3 episodes because it was too vulgar.
<Michael> also hai Shizuka
<StinkomanFan> SHUT-UP
<MadSurge> Hey Shizuka :$
<Spectrum_Rush> afternoon Shizuka
<MegaMoonShine> Hi everypo- OMG Ren & Stimpy!! :O
<Braviary> It was also unfunny.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Braviary: It's what happens when you try too hard to be adult.
<JESmith71> There were six episodes of Adult Party Cartoon, but only three aired. The other three made it to DVD
<Michael> Winter_Shadowhooves: damn dat scared me
<ancientblood> shouldnt they be playing games
<Winter_Shadowhooves> XD
<Malavolent> That accent.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Like Drawn Together.
<Vordox> O.o
<MegaMoonShine> O______0
<StinkomanFan> Thanks for that Winter_Shadowhooves
<Michael> hai MegaMoonShine
<MegaMoonShine> He tough
<Winter_Shadowhooves> your welcome
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: That would NOT be shown here :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Which was a bad show because it was too adult.
<Braviary> Adult Party Cartoon is evidence that an adult based MLP:FiM would never work.
<MadSurge> Hello MegaMoonShine!
<alexxm> wow
<JESmith71> Like I said the only good APC episode was Altrusits
<StinkomanFan> ALL THE CACTI
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<Shooeie> lol
<MegaMoonShine> Hello Michael and MadSurge :)
<Winter_Shadowhooves> prostitute reference
<CK|Catnap> Nittany: Implying that Drawn Together was adult. It was like an adult show written by kids. >_>
<Winter_Shadowhooves> this isnt a kids show
<Nittany_Discord> 11,011. Have sex change. 2. ??? 3. Profit!
<Lil_B> ohai MegaMoonShine :)
<MadSurge> Braviary: this worked because it was allegedly for kids :D
<MegaMoonShine> Hai Lil_B :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CK|Catnap: I didn't like Drawn Together.
<Lil_B> I'm too drawn too the Stream, I somehow phase out the chat XD
<MegaMoonShine> Snape hunting?
<CK|Catnap> Nittany: That's probably because it was a bad show. :P
<Michael> get our sniper riflesx!
<StinkomanFan> GO KILL A SNIPER
<Spectrum_Rush> Winter_Shadowhooves: yes, yes it is
<Braviary> Exactly, MadSurge. You take away that, and the jokes aren't risqué. They're just vulgar for vulgarity's sake. The adult references in MLP:FiM woudln't work if they made the cartoon for adults.
<MadSurge> ^
<Winter_Shadowhooves> ^
<Michael> ^^
<ancientblood> nittany_discord: shouldnt they be playing games and not watching little kids shows
<Braviary> It would just be an equine Family Guy.
<MegaMoonShine> ^
<Braviary> Late season Family Guy.
<StinkomanFan> I'VE HAD IT WITH THESE MOTHERFUCKING SNIPES
<StinkomanFan> IN THIS MOTHERFUCKING PLANE
<Winter_Shadowhooves> equine family guy...that needs to exist
<JESmith71> Nittany_Discord did you ever see the APC episode Altruists? Only one that felt close to the old ones (But mainly because they were doing a 3 Stooges homage)

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Braviary: That's what Drawn Together was like. Vulgar and offensive just to be vulgar and offensive.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> Ren and Stimpy. More fun than a ferret in your pants
<Dark_Horst> there seems to be an irc client in the window
<StinkomanFan> X
<MadSurge> Stimpy is always the cause of his own misery

<mishia> alexxm: Celestia decided for the sake of harmony to keep all ponies living in the same territory, which cauesed proverty, overcrowding, filth, and such. Luna protested they should seprate them, but celestia said they must stay togatehr to avoid them becoming emneys amongst thier own ranks. Now luna picks up the orphans and homeless children and makes them her children of the night
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dark_Horst: I have to use a sound repeater on XP when streaming so I can hear what I stream, but it sometimes can't keep up with the sound stream. When it gets what are called underflows and overflows, the stream freezes for a bit.

<cachi01> Dj_Cyber-4G: alienware? enjoy it while it lasts
<CrimsonPhoenix> Very_Silly_Filly, indeed
<killerpony7733> Dj_Cyber-4G: Alienware is overpriced, Though very good looking design wise, But lacking in power
<Very_Silly_Filly> Jesus christ, must cost like half the vloody keyboards price to power

<killerpony7733> Very_Silly_Filly: Ahh, Still this brand is techinally considered rare and even more due to the company going bankrupt a year or two ago
<Meanwhile> Pfft. That's a good sign.

<cachi01|Ib> brb going to buck some paintings
<Thrackerzod> Can someone tell me why im omegle?
<Michael> no stream: the chat is one desert
<cachi01|Ib> forget it
<cachi01|Ib> fucking game wont start
<Pudge> Heyy everypony!
<cachi01|Ib> hi Pudge!
<Michael> wat Thrackerzod
<Thrackerzod> hi pudge
<CrimsonPhoenix> Thrackerzod, you want to have fun with random people?
<Dken2021> hai Pudge
<cachi01|Ib> do i need some kind of program to run rpg maker games?
<Pudge> It's a little deserted in here.
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH Thrackerzod pretend you're one of the main 6
<Thrackerzod> Did that
<kirzstryfe> 8,6yes cachi01|Ib, you do
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01|Ib, necessarly you would need RPG maker yes
<Michael> ^
<Meanwhile> Thrackerzod: You're omegle?
*cachi01|Ib face fucking palm
<cachi01|Ib> thx
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sup Phoenix bro
<cachi01|Ib> that explains why the first level wont load
<kirzstryfe> 8,6you don't need the full program if the game is coded to work off of the rtp
<Shooeie> What we watching?
<Thrackerzod> Meanwhile No this is trackerzod
<cachi01|Ib> kirzstryfe: well it shows the new game exit and continue menu
<Meanwhile> Thrackerzod: How typically normal.
<Michael> nothing Shooeie , there's no stream
<cachi01|Ib> kirzstryfe: then the introduction which is a black screen with white letters
<cachi01|Ib> then after those letters end the game freezes and it wont load the level
<Thrackerzod> Hey who wants to play tf2?
<Michael> Thrackerzod: what server?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6could be an issue with either the game or the rtp, I'd suggest reinstalling/downloading both
<cachi01|Ib> ok thx
<kirzstryfe> 8,6if it doesn't work then, it's probably a bug, or the wrong rtp
<Thrackerzod> Micheal i unno trying to find one
<Pudge> what game is he making?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6no idea
<cachi01|Ib> rpgmakerweb.com right?
<Thrackerzod> Excuse me while i direct traffic to my stupidity #tf2
<Michael> Thrackerzod: you dont know any brony servers?
<Thrackerzod> nope
<TruePinkamena> Wait, what's this video for
<kirzstryfe> 8,6if you're making your own game you'd need the full program, if you're just trying to play someone else's game and it is coded to run off the rtp, that's all you would need
<kirzstryfe> 8,6just have to make sure it's the correct rtp, there are 3
<Very_Silly_Filly> kirzstryfe: What program? :S
<cachi01|Ib> it says i need 2 RTP's
<cachi01|Ib> which i think i ont have
<kirzstryfe> 8,6rpg maker
<cachi01|Ib> rpg maker 2003
<Very_Silly_Filly> OHHH
<cachi01|Ib> and 200
<cachi01|Ib> 0
<Very_Silly_Filly> I gave that a go
<Very_Silly_Filly> But I preferred Game Maker :)
<kirzstryfe> 8,6that's odd actually, unless they've pulled resources from 2 different rtp packages
<Thrackerzod> What about rpg maker?
<Dken2021> never could find 2003 version, like the music in there
<Very_Silly_Filly> Much more versatile for RPG makig
<cachi01|Ib> this is part of the manual
<cachi01|Ib> = How to Start / Troubleshooting =Make sure to extract the .rar file first.If you don't have the RPG Maker 2003 RTP installed, run RTPMaker.exe.Once these are done, simply run RPG_RT.exe.
<Thrackerzod> i wrote a rpg with word and a calulator and a pen lol
<Michael> lol
<Dken2021> dat oldschool

<Dken2021> lali-ho brony_swan
<Michael> hai brony_swan
<cachi01|Ib> then it says You shouldn't need any RPG Maker RTPs, but just in case, they can be downloaded from the links below.http://download.tkool-online.com/rtp/2000rtp.exehttp://download.tkool-online.com/rtp/2003rtp.exe
<Thrackerzod> Very_Silly_Filly whats it about?
<Bronysith> cachi01|Ib: file not found
<Very_Silly_Filly> Basically, you're stuck in time
<kirzstryfe> 8,6that's because it's a direct download link Bronysith, and it's there twice
<cachi01|Ib> its because the links are mixed lol
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's supposed to be set in the modern era, but some force sends you back into the Medieval times
<Thrackerzod> Mine is a zombie surival rpg that you cna play the zombies too nad its extremly balanced

<ArcherJoe11> Pudge: I managed to creep a co-worker out by trying to be nice. And because it's super hot and I walk into the office kitchen every 20-40 minutes to refuel my glass. Coincidentally at the same time as she did.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6technically, wouldn't all directions be in the direction of other galaxies?
<Meanwhile> Yes but he was heading out of the solar system as opposed to at something in it like they usually do.
<ArcherJoe11> kirzstryfe: Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss you end up with the stars.
<Pudge> ArcherJoe11: well there's a difference between creepy nice and nice nice, just try to keep it casual with your co-workers

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay.
<Marx> I find it annoying when you have a Youtube link to a video game theme or whatever and one day you try the link and find out the video and/or uploader was banned and you have to hunt down a new video of the theme. It's especially annoying when if you don't know the proper name of the song, it's 10x harder to find the right video.
<cachi01|Ib> yay
<ponyfromPR> RICE N BEANS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Flutteryay.

<MaxTheBrony> What is a good website to upload photos nice and easy :P? i just need your opinion on a thing.
<ArcherJoe11> Your thoughts: Do Changelings eat all the love or do they just feed on the energy that surrounds ponies with love in their heart?
<cachi01|Ib> MaxTheBrony: tinypic
<Discord> Can you shorten the exaust?
<MaxTheBrony> ah ty
<Discord> Hmm.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> no
<ponyfromPR> that game looks awesome

<Jim> oh my
<alexxm> bye Michael
<ArcherJoe11> Your thoughts everypony: Do Changelings eat all the love inside a pony or do they just feed on the energy that surrounds ponies with love in their heart?
<Meanwhile> This one looks like a Bollywood X-wing.
<Chrysalis> Today's Kill Count: 7 (+1 Lost, +3 game says no)
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Yo I heard you like to party so I put Pinkie Pie in your Party and I gave her a party cannon

<alexxm> ArcherJoe11 whats the question
<BronyInstrmntl|music> i don't think the wings are long enough.
<ArcherJoe11> Your thoughts everypony: Do Changelings eat all the love inside a pony or do they just feed on the energy that surrounds ponies with love in their heart?

<MaxTheBrony> cachi01|Ib: Allright :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01BRB
<Epicmetalbrony> @ archer I believe a changeling feeds from the energy of love and drains a pony overtime. You could see how weakened shining armor was at the final.
<Meanwhile> MaxTheBrony: Well, I think changing the direction of the eye lean would help with the looking angry.
<XylemTube> This looks like a spore mod
<cachi01|Ib> XDDD
<MaxTheBrony> Ah
<Discord> I love spore
<cachi01|Ib> spore mod that was funny
<MaxTheBrony> less forward with the eyebrows?
<BronyInstrmntl|music> i love spore too
<MaxTheBrony> ok :)
<Epicmetalbrony> This is going to be a funny design *.*
<derpy_pony> I like the music
<Meanwhile> MaxTheBrony: As for the ear, maybe drooping it less and making it less concealed would help. And yeah, less eyebrow.
<Jim> XylemTube, This is Kerbal Space Program, a sepperate game
<ArcherJoe11> Epicmetalbrony: The tired Shining Armor was because he was Brainwashed repeatedly and he used the Shield Spell everyday on all of Canterlot.
<Discord> This looks alot like spore
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> why is that half the games you guys ever mention I have never got into
<XylemTube> make it looks like a dong
<MaxTheBrony> ah :D Thank you Meanwhile and cachi01|Ib :)

<Lawliman> Smaller exhaust.
<Darf14> I wonder if someone tried making a R-wing for a spaceship
<EspyLacopa> More thrust?
<Jim> It needs about 20% more fuel
<Meanwhile> Giggity.
<VenHur96> Meh, why not call it the X-Wing II?
<EspyLacopa> The *-wing
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Because arwings are cooler
<XylemTube> it will make it 20% hotter
<Discord> !!!
<ArcherJoe11> EspyLacopa: The Dead Wing?

<BronyInstrmntl|music> the chances of success are 100%!
<EspyLacopa> Why no bits?
<Meanwhile> It costs 400,000 credits to launch this ship, for twelve seconds.
<Darf14> *bets 500 rupees that this will work*
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I'm going to leave. I'm supposed to only come here on the graveyard shift
<VenHur96> It's a giant missile fulfilled with radioactive plutonium and fire, it's also an H-Bomb!
*cachi01|Ib bets navi that this ship is going to fail
<Discord> I bet 400,000 credits that this willl work
<Jim> It costs 400,000 Kerbals, for Sumica to play KSP, for twelve seconds.
