<TOY_PON3> Meanwhile: :D
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Can anyone link me to Wrek's DA?
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Excuse me >< Anypony*
<Bluestrom_S> why was Wrek cussing?

<TOY_PON3> SayWhat: Go ahead
<TOY_PON3> Bluestrom_S: Someone was complaining about his drawing
<Kez_Pony> Well I'm gone ya'll.
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> The poor fools

<Sundaysmile> *foals
<Tovler> wait. what's wrong with his draw- *goes to bronystate*
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Gah! You're right. What's wrong with me? ><
<Meanwhile> Eurostream in 50 minutes :3
<Bluestrom_S> okay? but did that justify saying "shut the fuck up" to them?
<Meanwhile> Wrek isn't really known for his subtlety.
<TOY_PON3> True
<CountDoofus> that Fluttershy drawing... dear god
<Bluestrom_S> but you shouldn't be lashing out to your viewers like that
<Bluestrom_S> no matter so annoying they can be
<CountDoofus> why can't I steal someone's skills like they did in Space Jam
<Sundaysmile> looks like I missed some drama
<fluttercry> 05,15CountDoofus become Kirby
<Meanwhile> Besides, until the creator says otherwise, you aren't really allowed to criticise their creative works.
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Indeed
<RaveBrony> Wrek is mod, he does as he pleases :D
<TOY_PON3> But mods have limits too RaveBrony
<Meanwhile> Who watches the Watchmen?
<unfoundbug> TOY_PON3 not really, they enforce the rules
<Bluestrom_S> viewers can say what they like or don't like, if your hosting (streaming) you cant just say to people "shut the fuck up"
<Bluestrom_S> what if people started saying shut the fuck up to wrek or the other mods?
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Bluestrom_S You can, but it's not wise.
<unfoundbug> yes they can its their stream
<Bluestrom_S> it wouldnt go so well
<RaveBrony> Yeah, but meh, I lash out too when people critic my drawing (mainly becuz they arent worth garbage)
<fluttercry> 05,15Look maybe Wrek went to far. Maybe not, but just let it go.
<RaveBrony> So i understand his ways :P
<TOY_PON3> unfoundbug: If a mod doesn't do it's job other mods can vote to demod you or ban you
<RaveBrony> o.o
<TOY_PON3> Or atleast I think it works that way
<unfoundbug> and then we lose one of the best streamers
<Tovler> They're just bronystate mods, not military training instructors. They're not supposed to be held to a higher standard.
<TOY_PON3> unfoundbug: Of course
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> %Fluttercry is right. Let it go.
<Dark_Horst> ....bronie's are kinda edgy today, it seems
<TOY_PON3> Tovler: Exactly
<RaveBrony> Inb4 some ponies get Da Boot for continuing the convo :D
<Meanwhile> That's kinda untrue Tovler.
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Tovler Lol Like MTI's are held to a higher standard
<fluttercry> 05,15No no no one's getting the boot. I'm just asking everyone to let this go.
<Scavender> So, we meet again, my old nemesis - Wheel of Buffering.
<Meanwhile> It makes sense to hold people in positions of power to higher expectation, but Wrek is...well, Wrek.
<TOY_PON3> fluttercry: Will do
<RaveBrony> Oh, ok :3
<unfoundbug> so, how bout them ponies
<RaveBrony> ^
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Dark_Horst Well, what do you expect? no ponies this week XD
<Sundaysmile> Would probably be a good idea for someone to take the reigns of the stream to take viewer's minds off of the topic
<TOY_PON3> So who likes Derpy?
<TOY_PON3> :3
<Tovler> Except ValtheJean. He's kind of a policeman-ish mod.
<Sundaysmile> I.E. play a vid or something
<Dark_Horst> well then, everybody aqueeze a beanbag or something
<unfoundbug> TOY_PON3 really?
<Meanwhile> Val hates Trixie, he is automatically absolved of all wrongdoing.
<unfoundbug> this convo... again...
<TOY_PON3> unfoundbug: Lol I know everypony does :D
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> BTW,
<RaveBrony> Well, im still confused... who is TRULY best pony?
<TOY_PON3> Val hates Trixie? :(
<fluttercry> 05,15SO WHO LIKES PONIES
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> I should mention, that i was syndicate...
<Bluestrom_S> if you have a resposibily to keep mod or viewer otherwise to need to keep to those resposibilities especialy if your a mod because you need to show/lead your viewers in the proper etiquette
<Dark_Horst> all except TOY_PONY, he may chew on a brick that has "i will not bring up controversity in the chat" written on it
<unfoundbug> already pretty sick of the argument, unless it goes down on hubworld or somewhere more official than itunes
<Meanwhile> Anyone with a working brain hates Trixie.
<CountDoofus> I LIEK PONIEZ
<Jim> I<3 ponies
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> %fluttercry I DO
<Midnight_Fyre> Val says Trixie should die in a fire
<Iwubponiez> ponies? you serious?
<unfoundbug> its just apple covering their asses
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Meanwhile I...kinda like Trixie
<KwakLad> fluttercry: i does!
<Meanwhile> I say Trixie should be run over with a steamroller.
<unfoundbug> luna best pony!
<Jim> ^
<TOY_PON3> Dark_Horst: Yeah thanks bro :|
<Dark_Horst> you're welcome B
<Bluestrom_S> I myself was offended that he lashed out like that because someone complained about he's drawing
<fluttercry> 05,15That's a funny way to spell fluttershy unfoundbug
<Dark_Horst> *B)
<Sundaysmile> good old viewers, attentions spans of a goldfish lol
<PinkieCupcake> I lik Twilight and Pinkie
<fluttercry> 05,15Bluestrom_S Seriously let it go
<Tovler> Mods here are mods for their tech skills and refreshing personality. not some moral code.
<Midnight_Fyre> Trixie is OK, but I have always said that Silverspoon and Diamond Tiara should be forced to fight to the death and then we kill the winner
<Iwubponiez> so why do you liek poniez?
<D15c0rD> but discord rules them all
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: you can't just say let it go and assume that fixes it.
<Placebo> Morning everyone.
<TOY_PON3> Dark_Horst: Sorry if I started it :(
<Meanwhile> Engage the dialogue and work for an answer.
<TOY_PON3> Placebo: <3
<fluttercry> 05,15Well it really does need to stop. It's just going to turn into a big issue, and it really doesn't need to
<unfoundbug> fluttercry, nope i just dont think fluttershy is best, i believe she is third on my list
<Dark_Horst> somehow i'm getting the feeling that certain events suudenly have us all twitching in our seats today
<RaveBrony> I agree with fluttercry
<Tovler> Don't insult art and don't expect manners especially on the internet. The End.
*Sky_Pirate_Brony readies the Friendship canons on his airship at unfoundbug subtly
<Sundaysmile> yes, the derpy issue has us all finiky
<Sundaysmile> or most of us
<Tarku> I also agree with fluttercry
<Bluestrom_S> ok I'm going to shut up, I just wanted to say what I wanted to say
<RaveBrony> ^
<Tovler> Now I have to rewind. I was watching Archer
<TOY_PON3> Man this is because we don't have a new pony episode today! :(
<RaveBrony> ^^
<Iwubponiez> ^
<Meanwhile> Resolution. So anyhoo.
<RaveBrony> Its tearing us apart! :(
<Sundaysmile> imagine what it'll be like when season 2 ends
<PinkiePieCopy> =3
<Tarku> indeed TOY_PON3
<Meanwhile> Pinkie Pie is best pony.
<Sundaysmile> and we have six months of downtime
<TOY_PON3> Why can't we all just get along?!
<fluttercry> 05,15The Great Pony Draught 2
<Iwubponiez> sundaysmile like this :[
<TOY_PON3> ^
<RaveBrony> Damn you Discord!! Show yourself!!!
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Yoy_Po3 is right
<Tovler> When Season 2 ends, College student will be home and epic PMVs will ensue
<Dark_Horst> TOY_PONY:i think that's what doctors call cold detoxication
<TOY_PON3> Indeed
<unfoundbug> When season 2 ends, the amount of work done by bronies will take a massive increase
<Meanwhile> Wait until the delay between seaons 2 and 3.
<RaveBrony> :o
<RaveBrony> Oh man....
<Dark_Horst> it's gonna be a bloodfest
<TOY_PON3> unfoundbug: Sk true
<TOY_PON3> So
<unfoundbug> so, lets find a tf2 server to flood with ponies
<Meanwhile> Then you can complain about being denied new pony.
<RaveBrony> ^
<TOY_PON3> Yay tf2
<Tovler> Plus, it'll be summer. Summer Summer Summer Tiiiiem
<CountDoofus> watching the stream on bronyfunds, you kids go ahead and play ;)
<Sundaysmile> Eternal Summer
<Tovler> Time to kick back and unwind
<flutter_spin> *facepalm* Today is rather lame
<Meanwhile> I don't even know summertime anymore.
<TOY_PON3> Meanwhile: I'll be ready for that
<saske909090> is that live?
<Sundaysmile> TOY_PON3 has weed
<Iwubponiez> yay summer :)
<RaveBrony> o_o
<TOY_PON3> Nope I'm straight edge :3
<Meanwhile> I hate summer.
<TOY_PON3> I do too
<saske909090> srsly is this live
<kingqball> guys is there something wroung with the stream its not loading...
<TOY_PON3> I love Spring
<Iwubponiez> why ? :'(
<Sundaysmile> not at the moment saske
<Meanwhile> It's hot and there are bugs everywhere.
<Tovler> My electric bill loves summer.
<saske909090> oooooooooohhhhhhhhh
<saske909090> ok
<RaveBrony> Its not live, atm. The streamer went to eat dinner
<Meanwhile> I like winter.
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> I say we go bring Bronies to a game
<Midnight_Fyre> it will be live as soon as Wrek gets back from eating
<Meanwhile> I like the cold and the wind and the ice.
<Kammerjunk|Protest> And then no one recognised my Dashie shirt at the ACTA protest.
<Sundaysmile> Hate the wind
<Dark_Horst> i don't like summer that much. against the cold, you can tank up
<RaveBrony> We need Fighting Is Magic, Now! :D
<Sundaysmile> annoying as hell
<Dark_Horst> but heat? completely at mercy
<fluttercry> 05,15awww Kammerjunk
<TOY_PON3> RaveBrony: Indeed we do
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> RaveBrony We need 30cc's of Fighting is Magic, stat!
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, in an area with 12000 people protesting against ACTA, how could I find NO bronies at all?
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: first world problems.
<RaveBrony> What Kammerjunk?? D:
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: I know, right.
<RaveBrony> Lol :D
<Midnight_Fyre> Maybe they noticed it but didn't say anything
<TOY_PON3> Poor Kammerjunk :(
<KwakLad> I feel bad for you Kammerjunk why would fellow residents of the internet not atleast recognise it
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Kammerjunk Likely they just were nervous about being Bronies
<RaveBrony> Any idea when Fighting is Magic and Ponykart are actually coming out? lol
<Kammerjunk> Perhaps.
<RaveBrony> ^
<TOY_PON3> Closet Brony is worst brony
<RaveBrony> I agree
<TOY_PON3> Just saying
<Iwubponiez> ^
<Dark_Horst> i think the only answer to that will be a "when it's done"
<BritishBrony> ikr.
<unfoundbug> oi, some of us have reasons to be hidden
<Wrek> 05nom
<Meanwhile> Wb Wrek
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> WB Wrek
<Iwubponiez> hi wrek
<TOY_PON3> Hi Wrek
<RaveBrony> Wrek! <3
<Dark_Horst> programming games is fucking hard. i know it, i did
<BritishBrony> All my friends know I'm a brony. :3
<unfoundbug> the only people i told that i was a brony have literally excommunicated me
<Wrek> 05chili con carne with con chips and creme fraice
<TOY_PON3> Oo
<RaveBrony> mmmmmmmm
<Meanwhile> Ew.
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> I'm starving
<saske909090> WREK
<saske909090> :D
<BritishBrony> Herm?
<saske909090> guys
<Kammerjunk> I live in a country where gays can be married in the church, which is pretty darn neat. People here should be comfortable in their bronydom.
<Tovler> unfoundbug: you're friends with the Pope?
<BritishBrony> I had a Pasty. :P
<rainbow> unfoundbug same here
<saske909090> i just found something made by DJ pon3
<TOY_PON3> Wrek made me hungry now
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> unfoundbug My non-bronie friends have either converted, or just laugh at me XD
<saske909090> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGjvBrRRek&feature=related
<Dark_Horst> isn't "with con" kinda like saying the same thing twice?
<PinkieCupcake> Umm ...is anypony's livestream still loading?
<RaveBrony> I cant find my damn vinyl Sctrach t-shirt :(
<Dark_Horst> frozen for me
<RaveBrony> *Scratch
<Meanwhile> Probably because nothing is actually being streamed yet.
<TOY_PON3> mfw I dont have a pony t-shirt :(
<Iwubponiez> ^
<unfoundbug> itd be nice to try to convert, only brony i know of in a hundred miles
<Wrek> 05i got a raid now so i wont stream untill after EBMN
<BritishBrony> I really want a Poy TShirt.
<Iwubponiez> ^
<Meanwhile> Raid? You playing WoW?
<Dark_Horst> Wrek be smashing things
<BritishBrony> Pony*
<unfoundbug> BritishBrony know the feeling, hasbro really needs to ship some stuff for uk bronies
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> What server Wrek?
<Wrek> 05planning on coninuing my Deus Ex lets play (drunk) after the post show though
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: Jalapeños chili with potato chips and pomfrittes.
<Placebo> Where you all should be > http://www.bronyfunds.com/?page_id=13
<TOY_PON3> I only have 6 friends that I know in Fresno that love MLP
<BritishBrony> Yep. :c
<Meanwhile> Wrek: define raid for me please.
<TOY_PON3> I consider myself lucky
<fluttercry> 05,15Drunk Deus Ex? SIGN ME UP
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Meanwhile A huge amount of people whooping some dungeon ass
<Dark_Horst> oh, playing drunk is always good!
<Kammerjunk> BritishBrony: It costed me around a hundred dollars to get two brony shirts shipped to Denmark.
<BritishBrony> Crap. D:
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Kammejunk Try being a Brony in alaska
<TOY_PON3> Yay for Drunk playing :3
<Meanwhile> Sky_Pirate_Brony: No shiz, but I want to know what he's raiding and whether I might have some input.
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> At least my wife is a pony fan to..
<unfoundbug> wrek, any plans for tf2 later?
<Dark_Horst> i played BF3 drunk. it makes the cod noobs a lot more bearable B)
<MRpoNeigh> the wtream aint workin 4 me
<Dark_Horst> he's not streaming right now
<MRpoNeigh> oh lol fail on me :D
<Wrek> 05read previous post unfoundbug
<TOY_PON3> brb
<Kammerjunk> Wrek Drunkenly Wrecks Deus Ex?
<Kammerjunk> I'll be there.
<Tovler> (neat. Nisemonogatari is out.)
<Midnight_Fyre> So I went to Wal Mart the other day and the blindbag pony box was empty. I asked a worker if she could check if there is a toy in stock. She screamed across the store to someone else "This man is looking for a toy". So glad I didn't say I was looking for a My Little Pony because that would be akward to hear screamed across the store
<unfoundbug> i was referring to AFTER deus ex
<Meanwhile> THIS MAN IS LOOKING FOR MY LITTLE PONY.
<Kammerjunk> Midnight_Fyre: Did you laugh at her for her ignorance?
<flutter_spin> noooooooooo. They changed Derpy's voice? oh come on!
<Dark_Horst> sounds like pinkie broke out again, eh?
<CCCP> THIS MAN IS A BRONY!
<Sundaysmile> CALL THE PARTY POLICE
<Tarku> Midnight_Fyre: I'd proudly scream that in walmart
<flutter_spin> It is cute, but I will always know her from the original voice work
<Midnight_Fyre> no, I just explained to the other lady what I was looking for. There weren't any in stock unfortunately
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2CRjPO73Dg
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> SOUND THE PINKIE ALARM http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez-OJ4zPfC8
<Kammerjunk> You should totally have laughed at her.
<CCCP> do you think that store clerks are starting to notice more grown men bying MLP toys?
<Dark_Horst> i'd be screaming that in a walmart too.... mostly because i live on the other side of that whole lot of water, but hey, details
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> CCCP probably all use the excuse it's for their daughter or something
<Meanwhile> I don't even have anywhere nearby that sells MLP.
<Kammerjunk> And then told her to look up "bronies".
<CCCP> Sky_Pirate_Brony: ya
<Midnight_Fyre> Well, I just asked her if she could check on a toy, and then she called to the other lady who is in charge of toys
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<fluttercry> 05,15I still need to check my McDonalds
<Kammerjunk> It's like that.
<Bluestrom_S> http://i.imgur.com/925X7.gif
<CCCP> wait WTF? derpy got a new voice?
<Kammerjunk> Bluestrom_S: woah
<Kammerjunk> Dude.
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Here we go again XD
<Sundaysmile> I used to do a pricecheck on some of the most embarassing items when I worked in a store
<flutter_spin> yeah, new voice
<Kammerjunk> I can see infinite.
<Dark_Horst> the horrible thing is: the pony merge over here is a fucking trainwreck
<Midnight_Fyre> I think the McDonald's toys don't start until March
<Bluestrom_S> enjoy
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/UooHK.jpg
<Dark_Horst> *merch
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm back.
<jffry890> is there no stream atm?
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, they're not selling ponies over here.
<flutter_spin> McDonalds still has the old Star Wars toys. Just came from there.
<Iwubponiez> AW MY EYES
<Meanwhile> Wb Nittany_Discord
<Sundaysmile> god help you if you came to my register with a tube of "Itch Cream"
<unfoundbug> welcome back Nittany_Discord
<flutter_spin> They will have new toys March 5th
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Midnight_Fyre Wait, wait, wait...Pony toys?
<BritishBrony> http://www.bronyfunds.com/?page_id=13 Anyone?
<Kammerjunk> Let me rephrase.
<Placebo> Hey guys, if you're bored without a stream, check out: http://www.bronyfunds.com/?page_id=13 and join #bronyfunds , where we're raising money for a former bronystate mod who's landed on hard times
<Tovler> We should all change our voice in protest. I'm talking like Bullwinkle until this is reversed.
<Kammerjunk> They're not selling ponies with Happy Meals over here.
<Midnight_Fyre> At McDonald's? Yes, they are coming in March
<Meanwhile> BritishBrony: made my donation already.
<Kammerjunk> Placebo: I would, but I'm broke until the 1st.
<BritishBrony> :/
<CCCP> i personaly dont think that they should replace derpy's voice but is it really that bad?
<Dark_Horst> i have my hopes that by some impossibility of marketing the mecdonalds ponie will swap to here
<Dark_Horst> but that's a small hope
<Sundaysmile> CCCP have you seen the edit yet?
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> CCCP I think they should replace it, BUT derp it up a bit
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm fine with the voice replacement. Not so much with the rest.
<CCCP> yes i just did
<Kammerjunk> Derpy should talk in G major.
<flutter_spin> I find it amusing that the new voice is cute and would fit her, but I now know Derpy with the "original" voice
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<Kammerjunk> All the time.
<Meanwhile> What flutter_spin said
<Kammerjunk> It'd be like her normal voice.
<Trollestia> I know that feel bro
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01G major Derpy XD
<Dark_Horst> agreed. the voice is nice. eyes not. namecensor not
<jffry890> i loved her voice
<Pyrexo> Heya Everypony :)
<Meanwhile> Allo Pyrexo
<Sundaysmile> Agreed Dark Horst
<jffry890> especially when she said ARe you okay R
<Midnight_Fyre> The new voice is OK, though the old one really grew on me, but removing her name was unforgivable
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That would be possessed Derpy.
<jffry890> especially when she said ARe you okay RAinbobw dash? anything i can do to help?
<Kammerjunk> Nittany_Discord: I still think it should happen.
<Pyrexo> Oh yeah Derpy! Terrible about the new "The Last Roundup"
<jffry890> wow type fail
<Kammerjunk> I have the original on my harddrive.
<Meanwhile> Should've left her name intact.
<Sundaysmile> Oh though the hub's fan inbox was shut down soon after the news was released
<Dark_Horst> i just want to know who came up with this. just to ask for a reason. i want to understaaaand
*Tovler loves how she cheerfully and disingenuously says "My Bad" now.
<fluttercry> 05,15We should take Hasbro...and BURN IT DOWN
<SonicRainboom> Yep.
<flutter_spin> EQD noted that the DVD will still have the uncut version
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't spread blame yet.
*Meanwhile hits fluttercry with a cinderblock.
<Sundaysmile> it was reopened an hour later but was shut down again
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: Because the voice actor thought Derpy was male.
<Sundaysmile> presumably their inbox was full...
<fluttercry> 05,15ouch
<fluttercry> 05,15I never get to start a riot :(
<Pyrexo> Derpy....male...?
<Dark_Horst> but that'S not the reason for cutting the name and fiddling with the eyes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hasbro's probably shut it down due to the incoming mail.
<Pyrexo> :S
<CCCP> dont worry comrades one day Derpy will rise from the ashes back to her former glory
<Midnight_Fyre> Kinda extreme, don't you think fluttercry?
<Bluestrom_S> http://escism.net/omfgdogs/
<Sundaysmile> indeed
<Kammerjunk> Oh right, it was Tabitha.
<fluttercry> 05,15...that's the joke Midnight_Fyre
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm sure a lot of it is hate mail sadly.
<Midnight_Fyre> I know, so was my post
<CCCP> Bluestrom_S: :D
<Meanwhile> Bluestrom_S: that should come with a warning.
<Sundaysmile> Nittany - most of it was automated mail send via the petitions
<September> I don't see anything on the screen, is the stream currently down or am I lagging?
<Kammerjunk> When I hear "Tabitha", I just automatically think Black Mountain Radio.
<Bluestrom_S> its rainbows of dogs
<fluttercry> 05,15WTF did I just see
<Sundaysmile> sent*
<Dark_Horst> you! ameribronies! stalk thiessen!
<Midnight_Fyre> Not streaming right now
<Bluestrom_S> /post warning
<Dark_Horst> find out!
<Pyrexo> Bluestrom: :O Should've warned us it was dogs
<CCCP> doggies :3
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Ameribronies? I like that
<flutter_spin> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/derpy-has-been-modified.html
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like that dog gif.
<Meanwhile> Should've warned us it can cause seizures.
<ApplejackDaniels> lmao thank you Bluestrom
<Kammerjunk> It's so hard to find my Dashie cursor in that rainbow dog thing.
<Derpy_Hooves> REGARDING DERPY: i stumbled upon something that might ease your minds
<Midnight_Fyre> yes?
<CCCP> http://kreoss.deviantart.com/journal/Derpy-287023334
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> That an animator said she'd be ok
<flutter_spin> Also: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/01/new-falloutequestria-side-stories.html I guess for you Fallout MLP guys
<Derpy_Hooves> CCCP just linked it
<Sundaysmile> already read it
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Kammerjunk Dashie cursor?
<Sundaysmile> it does not ease my mind
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> I want it.
<CCCP> Derpy_Hooves: oops didn't see
*Tovler shudders when he hears "Love and Tolerate"
<Kammerjunk> Sky_Pirate_Brony: Hold on.
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Derpy will be fine...Faust and the team love us, remember
<The4thwall|shower> Looking at some graphic equalizers for my laptop. I like the look of Realtime equalizer, does anyone know of another program out there?
<Kammerjunk> I -think- I can find it again.
<Meanwhile> It's easy to say love and tolerate, it's a lot harder to actually do it.
<Pyrexo> She'll be fine...? As in...?
<Dark_Horst> it's an airy definition
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Pyrexo she'll be her normal derpy self before long
<Kammerjunk> I know somepony on BronyState made it.
<Kammerjunk> But I'm having difficulty remembering who.
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Kammerjunk don't worry about it. Thanks though.
<The4thwall|shower> made what?
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm just afraid that they will never shout out to us again after all this
<Meanwhile> It was Flaria wasn't it?
<Kammerjunk> Yes!
<fluttercry> 05,15because I know I sure as hell wouldn't
<PinkySpice> o-o
<Kammerjunk> Flaria.
<Tovler> Flaria
*Sky_Pirate_Brony drowns his screen in Derpies
<rainbow> deeeeerp
<Sundaysmile> they might but it will probably be not as blatant
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Derpy's*
<Pyrexo> Sky_Pirate_Brony yay :D then why are people getting angry?
<Sundaysmile> maybe renaming heartstrings to Lyra or something
<Dark_Horst> i'm still kinda scared. because now it looks like a few screamers without reason have won. and i'm afraid that might happen again
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Pyrexo Because it's not for sure. I'm just saying I doubt they'll let tit go..
<Dark_Horst> tasting blood and all
<The4thwall|shower> Oh, the naming situations?
<flutter_spin> Derpy getting new voice
<The4thwall|shower> NO
<The4thwall|shower> just
<The4thwall|shower> NO
<Pyrexo> Mmm We can only hope :)
<Midnight_Fyre> The thing that really concerns me about the whole Derpy thing is that they are going to be less likely to give out fanservice like that in the future, and likely start focussing more on the target demographic
<ApplejackDaniels> Is there an offical response on what the issue was and why it was changed?
<Meanwhile> Hope is an immensely flimsy thing.
<The4thwall|shower> I like my current derpy
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2CRjPO73Dg if you missed it
<Tovler> It was already confirmed that derpy would never speak again.
<Sundaysmile> It was changed because of an outcry that it was offensive
<Pyrexo> Derpy getting a new voice? I've gotten used to the first one already, albeit disliking it first time round
<Midnight_Fyre> Was it?
<Dark_Horst> it's also unlikely that she'll speak again
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Midnight_Fyre I REALLY doubt that. They started with us, and they KNOW they'll lose 90% of their audience if they dropped us.
<PinkySpice> whos streamning?
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Tovler That's, sadly, more likely.
<Dark_Horst> and that really rustles my jimmies. a lot
<Meanwhile> True, but if they 'dropped' us, would we really notice?
<Sundaysmile> Hasbro has YET to release an official statement, it's only been comments from the animators and staff
<The4thwall|shower> Derpy is best secondary
<fluttercry> 05,15Sky_Pirate_Brony I'm pretty sure we don't make up that much of the commuinty
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: yeah
<Meanwhile> They could completely ignore the fandom in every possible way, it'd still be MLP.
<fluttercry> 05,15in fact I'd say really we're a very small fraction
<Kammerjunk> I wasn't there when Derpy was made. So I guess that kind of takes some of the glamour away from her.
<Meanwhile> It's not like they'd stick a sign on the start of each episode "You're weird if you're watching this and over 14 years old"
<Tovler> And now future shows will be afraid to embrace their fandoms.
<Sundaysmile> I don't know many that do?
<The4thwall|shower> A small fraction can ruin an engine
<pony_7430> Is it just me, or is there nothing on the stream and it's just buffering?
<Pyrexo> :( true
<Dark_Horst> nothings on
<Meanwhile> Nothing is streaming.
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> %fluttercry The side demo is what makes most of the fanbase...If they acctually made it that it was more chilidsh and girly..
<Sundaysmile> not yet anyway
<flutter_spin> no livestream
<The4thwall|shower> the same way a small fraction can start a revoultion
<The4thwall|shower> but if this small fraction never voices, nothing will happen
<Meanwhile> Be prepared for nothing to happen then.
<Sundaysmile> and do what? boycott MLP? and risk putting it out of business?
<Dark_Horst> the bronies are what made the series big, hasbro noticed that and started coming towards us. if worst case scenario of them driopping us would come through, it would be noticable
<Sundaysmile> you want that?
<Tovler> Hasbro response: Look at Princess Cadence. Isn't she beautiful and she's getting married!
<flutter_spin> woot! stream
<Meanwhile> Since we lost to some screamy whiners.
<rainbow> uhhh
<Kammerjunk> I didn't mind Derpy's original voice. I don't think I'll mind the new one.

<Everypony_Loves_Flut> Update 5: The Last Roundup has been put back up on iTunes. Derpy's name has been removed, and her voice changed so as to not be as silly as it was before. Unfortunately, this means that the name 'Derpy' has been retroactively un-canonized, due to being 'offensive'. Her eyes have also been mostly 'un-derped' in the animation.
<Sundaysmile> tied everything up too abruptly
<derpy_pony> Sundaysmile: I fear the worst

<Jaketehsnake> Mags hold ammo, clips feed into and internal magazine
<derpy_pony> why don't they have an mg turret? these handguns are a joke
<Onyxiaz> hax
<Soupjuce> the space mutiny movie got a 1.9 rating D:
<Dark_Horst> mean clips for mean bullets. L33/
<jffry890> itd be funny if when he was flaing his legs around climbing back onto the vehicle, he stabbed himself in the other leg

<Dermathil> o_o

<Meanwhile> Scary monsters.
<Aircrafter> oh shit, I thought she was going too say tentacle rape
<Aircrafter> nvm
<Jim> And then everybody diead
<Jaketehsnake> Glau is best fighter
<Onyxiaz> ;o
<Soupjuce> what the hell?
<pony_110270> Cool
<BritishBrony> I don't get it.
<Pyrexo> ???
<Iwubponiez> ^
<Purple`Prose> It gets explained
<ponypancakes> wat..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OK, who hit her kill button?
<Sundaysmile> MEOW
<IshBestPony> remind me again what the results of the lottery last night were
<Dermathil> woohoo
<Dermathil> hell yeah
<RAWRity> AttackWithHugs: That's what I'm telling anybody who asks about a new episode this week. Because it's been said 3 million times that THERE'S NO NEW EPISODE.
<pony_110270> A movie isnt a movie without a crazy out-of-nowhere fight scene.
<Jaketehsnake> dafaqu is going on
<flutter_spin> just wait a good 10 minutes. They explain it
<fluttercry> 05,15Raiders of the Lost Ark
<Meanwhile> Raiders of the Lost Ark was A
<fluttercry> 05,15Machete
<Jaketehsnake> i trust you flutter_spin
<Meanwhile> That's the only one I remembered.
<BritishBrony> Okay.
<DainbowRash> Dem skillz
<Dermathil> nutshot!
<RainbowPredator> NUTSHOT
<D1sc0rD> ouch
<Meanwhile> Harsh.
<pony_110270> She flashed
<ApplejackDaniels> me gusta
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm so excited for Raiders
<Jaketehsnake> thats above the brastrap
<AttackWithHugs> RAWRity: I knew there wasn't a new episode this week. That much I knew. I thought it was because of scheduling, like when S2 first premiered.
<IshBestPony> oh hai regulars of a State of the Brony variety
<Dermathil> double!
<Sundaysmile> MY BALLS!
<Tovler> We accept Scott Pilgrim random fight scenes. I smell a double standard
<Meanwhile> Allo IshBestPony
<Dermathil> we accept this too Tovler
<IshBestPony> Raiders is the first Indiana Jones right?
<fluttercry> 05,15Scott Pilgrim is best movie
<pony_110270> Texas
<RAWRity> AttackWithHugs: it is. But at this point people asking has become so annoying, I feel the need to fuck with them a little.
<nekohime> this scene isn't random
<TrixieMuffin> Eta kuramna sme
<Meanwhile> And then she passed out.
<nekohime> it just hasn't been explained yet
<fluttercry> 05,15yup
<Dark_Horst> off switch
<pony_110270> No way! Robocop is!
<IshBestPony> yay
<Jaketehsnake> I havent seen scott pilgrim, Has bronystate streamed it?
<derpy_pony> voice activation
<Sundaysmile> Words of Roofie
<D1sc0rD> the sleepover pills
*IshBestPony haz never seen Indiana Jones before
<Meanwhile> The shout of dismay.
<kingqball> the roofie dragon shout
<ApplejackDaniels> lol
<TopHat> ....what were those words again??
<RoboGerbil> lol little girl won the bar fight
*IshBestPony now he can start
<Sundaysmile> Klaatu Verta....
<Krakass> Don't say them out loud.
<Marx> hmm, so it's possible they rescheduled the new ep to next wek because they forsaw the Derpy thing happening and didn't want it to ruin the ep?
<RAWRity> TopHat: etocorum nas mei
<Jim> I bet you'd like to know, ey TopHat ^^
<Pyrexo> Mr British
<pony_110270> I watched RoboCop every day before I went to school for like 2 years and I've seen it about 30 times after that too and I STILL love it (I'm known to get borde of movies fast)
<RAWRity> Marx: eenope.
<fluttercry> 05,15I can't really say I have a favorite movie. but it's for sure up in my top 5
<Tovler> No, seriously. Can a 6 episode miniseries be a B movie?
<kingqball> Marx ,,,i think you were right
<Marx> Oh well, it was just a thought.
<Dermathil> no, tovler.
<RAWRity> Tovler: probably not.
<Jaketehsnake> lol 90lbs
<Dermathil> movies only.
<AttackWithHugs> RAWRity: It's because people are now used to episodes airing every single week and it's turning from "I can't waiit!" to "WHEN IS TEH EPISODE DFOFJODHFOHDJACSDF!" People just have no patience at all.
<nekohime> Marx: if they had shown a new ep today there probably wouldn't be as much focus on the derpy thing right now
<Navy_Brony> safe word...lulz
<Pyrexo> lol
<Meanwhile> The safety word is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis.
<pony_110270> Casey. I am disapoint.
<Jaketehsnake> now I know that
<Wrek> 05this Dr pepper was like dogsend
<ApplejackDaniels> tea cup
<Jim> The safety word is banana
<kingqball> lol
<Pyrexo> Big Wussy :)
<fluttercry> 05,15Drake is pissed!
<TopHat> DAMMIT
<Wrek> 05god*
<Meanwhile> Dat dogsend.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The safe word is Fluttershy.
<RAWRity> AttackWithHugs: it's not even that. It's the fact that every single place pony related has a timer set up to TELL these people when the next episode is. And they don't fucking check it because they're morons.
*IshSexiestPony glomps everypony in here
<KwakLad> The Holy Avenger doesnt like having a flesh bomb on his ship!
<Tovler> I'll pick it anyway. Mods normally ask you to pick a different movie if you're their for the lottery, right?
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: chill out.
<pony_110270> I just looked out my window and its like a blizzard but it was sunny 2 minutes ago
<RAWRity> It's like how people don't realize the difference between the timer counting to the euro show, and counting to the episode stream.
<pony_110270> Mind control
<RAWRity> Or how they can't be arsed to check a damn world clock to figure out their time zone. This is simple, easy to figure out stuff.
<nekohime> WARity: there's a counter to the euro show?
<RoboGerbil> Mr universe
<Soupjuce> what :
<nekohime> RAWRity*
<Sundaysmile> Mr Universe?

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Planet radio, where everyone gets brain cancer in 10 seconds flat.
<RoboGerbil> lol thats some setup
<Tovler> It took me like 3 days to learn that MLP was henceforth airing at 1pm. Schedule really aren't so simple to look up.
<Dark_Horst> you lost me at flüggen
<Sundaysmile> he has a holographic hooker
<AttackWithHugs> Krakass: I love that movie, but I've never heard that word in it, not even the unrated version
<derpy_pony> he talks too much
<pony_110270> I thout MLP aired at 10 AM
<ponypancakes> robo hooker?

<RAWRity> Tovler: the schedule was posted on EQD in its own post. Then you can just put in "1 pm EST" into a world clock.
<Krakass> It was printed on a piece of paper. And the guy couldn't pronounce it.
<Jaketehsnake> you sultry minx
<Orzaidius> whats happenin
<Tovler> that 1pm announcement got buried quickly
<derpy_pony> yay
<AttackWithHugs> Where were they at in the movie? Had they reached Germany at that time?
<pony_110270> Subliminal message
<SonicRainboom> Commercials are no longer just annoying.

<pony_110270> Ow
<Ingwaz> japanese and chinese writing can look very similar, but you can tell them apart if you know how
<monsterhunter> you know what this chat needs? needs more shuffling
<Jaketehsnake> throat PUNCH
<Meanwhile> It's gonna be THROAT PAWNCH
<Combustiblelemons> whoa
<BritishBrony> N
<BritishBrony> Bitch gotta gun.
<fluttercry> 05,15Ingwaz big and scary=chinese swirly and cute=japanese
<Combustiblelemons> anyone want to tell me what's going on?
<BritishBrony> I can't.
<RoboGerbil> the bitch got loose
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Things are going on.
<derpy_pony> aren't the kanji chinese?
<flutter_spin> give the movie 2 minutes
<nekohime> lots of rails on those steps
<pankreas> I don't know either, combustiblelemons
<Ingwaz> fluttercry: well, japanese has the big and scary too, but yeah, thats one way of putting it
<flutter_spin> They explain
<Combustiblelemons> as far as i can tell a psycho escaped.
<Meanwhile> Combustiblelemons: they're escorting the creepy girl and throat punched guy away from the universal government.
<pony_110270> Thats not how yuo hold a gun.
<Meanwhile> I think.
*Meanwhile shrugpony.
<flutter_spin> They explain in like ... 2 minutes
<D1sc0rD> this is like alien, just the enemy is not ugly
<Combustiblelemons> and why are they doing this?
<Dermathil> hahahaa
<Ingwaz> lol
<pony_110270> You're supposed to keep your finer off the trigger until you shoot.
<pikorar> Hello people. Sorry I couldn't watch the whole movie night last night, but I'm here now.
<Tovler> The Sea ponies of Atlantia declare war on on Equestria and send hurricane after hurricane towards the kindgom. Can Fluttershy and the former princess of the tides, Luna, stop the war from escalating any further. (I can post fake spoilers here, right?)
<Dark_Horst> not im movies
<Dermathil> Miranda is the planet
<Ingwaz> not when you're in a dangerous situation pony_110270
<Meanwhile> WRONG.
<Krakass> No, you're supposed to keep the finger off the trigger until you're ready to shoot.
<Tovler> aw, dang it
<DaringDude> whats playing and hai everypony :)

<Krakass> I know, I was agreeing with you.
<Dermathil> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Combustiblelemons> THEY DID IT
<Dermathil> SHEPARD
<Combustiblelemons> THEY BLEW IT UP
<Dermathil> NOOOOOOO
<Meanwhile> Wrex.

<Ingwaz> that would be awesome
<D1sc0rD> :'(
<monsterhunter> now if sonic and rainbow dash had a race who whould win?
<derpy_pony> they even set the playground on fire
<Dermathil> Ingwaz it was set on fire
<Ingwaz> would still be awesome
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He died because his swing was on fire.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> RD
<derpy_pony> evil people
<RAWRity> And thus, Mal decided to journey with Obi-wan, to avenge the deaths of Uncle Lars and Aunt Beru
<pankreas> and it burns, burns, burns, the swing of fire, the swing of fire . . .
<Jaketehsnake> NOT MAH SWING
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Sonic never broke the sounde barrier, despite his name.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> *sound
<Tovler> It was… Gojira
<Meanwhile> monsterhunter: RD would because Sonic is old and crippled and needs to just go sit down in retirement.
<d3rb> "i just wanted one more swing!"
<derpy_pony> they weren't very efficient at killing him
<pikorar> Why do space movies always have burning desert villages?
<Coolbluemidnite_x> Im back my laptop died on me
<derpy_pony> noobs
<flutter_spin> Bring him a pony!
<Dermathil> tovler: can fluttershy be a bad enough dude to save equestria?

<Ingwaz> you know, wearing a shirt just before its fully dry feels kind of nice
<Combustiblelemons> D:

<Meanwhile> Wb Coolbluemidnite_x
<Jaketehsnake> yo hands are bloody though!
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Aw :(
<Combustiblelemons> no homo moment.
<Combustiblelemons> it needed to be said.
<Meanwhile> ALL the homo.
<fluttercry> 05,15Nathan Drake is sad!
<derpy_pony> enough drama for now...fight scene!
<DaringDude> perfect tiiming with the first aid
<Coolbluemidnite_x> Haha tyuh everypony and yeah it needs repairing
<fluttercry> 05,15Sully died
<Ingwaz> although it seems to be bugging my skin
<Combustiblelemons> sully D:
<Meanwhile> Nathan Drake doesn't have the emotional capacity for sad.
<D1sc0rD> save the white city
<d3rb> too late jerks
<Combustiblelemons> oh god i almost cried in uncharted 3
<Tovler> Can she be a tree? (that means yes)
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Casey looks cool with a beard
<flutter_spin> that's it? I'm sorry?
<d3rb> my bad
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> :O
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: hint: he's not really sorry

<Meanwhile> Mans got some convictions.
<pikorar> Equestria!
<derpy_pony> he's a communist
<Coolbluemidnite_x> >.< i hate my memory i was talking to someone on chat then i forgot who it was T_T
<Jaketehsnake> RUSSIA
<Coolbluemidnite_x> is cool
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> I hate that guy
<flutter_spin> They did an awesome job with the guy's character, but they really push the limit on the humanity / monster morality issue
<monsterhunter> think about it a sec rainbow dash cant stand a long race but sonic will cause of hes running around and fights Dr.Eggman nearly all the time rainbow dash whould have not win what so ever (bronies gonna hate)
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> XD
<pikorar> REJECTED
<BritishBrony> denied.
<Combustiblelemons> buffer D:
<Meanwhile> monsterhunter: sonic needs to go lie down in a ditch and just die already.
<D1sc0rD> friend zoned
<BritishBrony> Yes, Meanwhile
<BritishBrony> c:
<pikorar> I always bring my PARTAY CANNON!
<BritishBrony> Just yes.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01Sonics
<RAWRity> monsterhunter: who says Rainbow can't keep up a long race? She did the running of the leaves TWICE in one day, a day after doing the Iron Pony Challenge.
<Jaketehsnake> blood
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Point taken.
<pikorar> Rabble rabble rabble!
<derpy_pony> shoot the captain!
<Tovler> (o shit. Tow No Quon episode 6 is out)
<prince-dari> Who did he just shoot...? O_o
<BritishBrony> We want a fight scene.
<RAWRity> prince-dari: survivor from the Alliance ship.
<Combustiblelemons> headshot
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> I think he shot the old guy
<RoboGerbil> he shot the alliance scout
*String_Shredder is shot
<flutter_spin> lol. That is still just random and awesome
<Starflash> I have no idea..
<Jaketehsnake> i have no idea
<Coolbluemidnite_x> boom headshot
<KwakLad> prince-dari: an alliance soldier
<Combustiblelemons> man that was weird
<String_Shredder> me prince-dari
<derpy_pony> stray bullet into the back of his head, and no one has to go through this nonsense
<DaringDude> this man is crazy
<Dermathil> HELL YES
<Dermathil> THIS PART IS AWESOME
<pikorar> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!
<KwakLad> Blood Duck!
<Coolbluemidnite_x> is cool
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> You saw Ghost Rider?
<Meanwhile> Dat red paint.
<Dermathil> SPACE SILENCE
<RoboGerbil> Spess Muhreens!
<monsterhunter> space core: IAM IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<Coolbluemidnite_x> i wanna see ghost rider my friend says its awesome
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Trust me it is!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Our ship is 20% more grimdark.
<Tovler> I loved Ghost Writer as a kid.
<DaringDude> its got nicalous cage.....
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> The CGI got exponentially better
<Sundaysmile> Ghost writer?
<flutter_spin> Just as long as River, the psychic, doesn't start doing some 80s dance steps --- I'll be fine
<D1sc0rD> if i ever get in space, i will let loose of a copy of the space core
<Jaketehsnake> nousterhunter omgomgomgomgIM IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<Coolbluemidnite_x> Pizza flavoured pasta <3
<Navy_Brony> ghost writer...laws
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's Ghost Rider.
<pikorar> Uh. Duh everybody love burning skeletons with super human powers.
<Tovler> Yeah. Ghost Writer on PBS
<Coolbluemidnite_x> And motorbikes
<Navy_Brony> And his pen is in flames.
<TopHat> nicolas cage is perfect for the movie; he plays a character with no soul
<Meanwhile> Welcome to Reaver space, leave your face at the doorstep.
<fluttercry> 05,15but are there bees?
<pikorar> Except his kryptonite is BEES
<DaringDude> ^
<flutter_spin> Reaver space, where everyone hears you scream
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<Jaketehsnake> beeeess
<Combustiblelemons> so reavers are space pirates basically?
<Sundaysmile> no
<Coolbluemidnite_x> buzzz
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> This reminds me of Star Wars
<Tovler> Speaking of Nic Cage, is Bad Lieutenant an A or B movie?
<flutter_spin> They explain that in about 15minutes
<Meanwhile> Space pirate cannibal loonies.
<BritishBrony> Please let something epic happen.
<Sundaysmile> space cannibals
<pikorar> Sounds like a car alarm.
<SonicRainboom> Reaver space: Even though it's in space, they can stilll here you.
<Combustiblelemons> wow
<RoboGerbil> space pirates fear reavers
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> And the Matrix
<Coolbluemidnite_x> space train
<RAWRity> Combustiblelemons: if space pirates were completely insane and had hour long rape sessions as they slowly ate people to death.
<derpy_pony> that was all?
<nekohime> zombie space pirates
<Coolbluemidnite_x> i heard a space train
<Sundaysmile> like space cannibal rapist serial killers
<AttackWithHugs> Okay, I'm back. what'd I miss?
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> And a few other movies where they shut everything off
<flutter_spin> You so impatient. They explain stuff afterwards :P
<Combustiblelemons> wow ._. dark
<Meanwhile> Reavers are utterly insane, they're like space vikings with less morals and more shouting.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> AD?!
<nekohime> Attack
<d3rb> reavers sound like cool guys
<Combustiblelemons> and noone can kill them?
<String_Shredder> best match up of cannibals: Painis cupcake vs Reavers
<nekohime> AttackWithHugs: people died
<Jaketehsnake> Meanwhile and Much Much more rape
<Krakass> There's a lot of them.
<Meanwhile> They're human. Technically.
<RAWRity> Combustiblelemons: nobody can ever accuse Joss Whedon of being too cheery.
<Combustiblelemons> well noone wants to do anything about them?
<Sundaysmile> you can kill em, there is just a lot of em
<pikorar> Do what you want cuz a space pirate is free! You're a space pirate! YAR HAR TEEDLEEDEE! Being a space pirate is alright with me!
<Navy_Brony> it's yoda
<Combustiblelemons> lol fair enough
<Ingwaz> this movie is making me want to play ME3 even more now
<flutter_spin> Combustiblelemons: They explain stuff here in a moment
<AttackWithHugs> nekohime: I figured that much.
<Combustiblelemons> good
<Meanwhile> Eat who you want cause a space pirate's free, you are a space pirate.
<RAWRity> Combustiblelemons: It's kind of difficult to kill them, what with the aforementioned murder/rape/cannibalism combo.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Mr Spock, what does the scanner say about this...ship?
<KwakLad> Its Dead Jim
<Meanwhile> Embodiment_Of_Awesom: http://i.imgur.com/UooHK.jpg

<flutter_spin> Star Trek Academy?
<RoboGerbil> go get him nappa
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Good anytime!
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> You made me smile smile smile
<Meanwhile> good Mornight.
<String_Shredder> good now
<Ingwaz> you know...bit odd that they clearly have space age technology, and only have regular ballistic weapons
<pikorar> According the schrodengers cat we can assume that the ship is both dead AND alive.
<Meanwhile> Why fix what isn't broke Ingwaz.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Nothing replaces bullets.
<Krakass> Kinetic weapons is best weapons.
<RAWRity> Ingwaz: they have more "futuristic" weapons, but regular guns are easier to come by.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi~ dead room is always dead during eurostream~
<Combustiblelemons> you can't beat the old fashioned guns ingwaz
<TopHat> ice beam
<Meanwhile> Not always
<Iwubponiez> did the chat get killed :O oh no!
<Meanwhile> Just usually.
<DainbowRash> What is this place filled with so many white
<KwakLad> Ingwaz: Regular balistic weapons work though
<Ingwaz> Meanwhile: thats the kind of reasoning that keeps us with engines in our vehicles that only operate at 26% efficiency
<Iwubponiez> nv
<Iwubponiez> nvm
<Jaketehsnake> Just because we have computers noa doesnt mean we dont use 300 year old gun tech
<flutter_spin> In the series, most of the shipments (including money) are "marked". It is easier to get standard weapons then advanced stuff
<Meanwhile> Ingwaz: What a story.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> On TV you see spike balls, nail guns, staple guns, death rays, and lazers that the ehro survives but I bet you 10 dollars that if they got shot with a bullet, story over. The ened.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> *end
<Meanwhile> That dead guy has a funny face.
<Coolbluemidnite_x> xD
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> They're sleeping.
<KwakLad> Ingwaz: AK47's are a bit out dated but they still work very well and are relativly cheap
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're being dead.
<d3rb> chilling
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> ...Forever
<String_Shredder> sleeping
<RoboGerbil> they sleeping
<monsterhunter> ZOMBIES!
<Ingwaz> indeed KwakLad, but weapons can be made more efficient
<flutter_spin> Patience. They explain this in a moment.
<Meanwhile> they're saying...nothing!
<Meanwhile> Dun dun duuun
<Tovler> … wut?
<RoboGerbil> they speak in tongues!
<Coolbluemidnite_x> What a twist
<Coolbluemidnite_x> xD
<Combustiblelemons> they're dead attention whore
*Tovler feels dizzy
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Shes starting to damage my calm.
<Sundaysmile> So they're all saying "Nothing" all the time?
<Meanwhile> Everybody's dead Dave.
<Sundaysmile> like the word "Nothing"
<String_Shredder> get up dead bodies! be zombies!
<Coolbluemidnite_x> she is starting to damage my car?
<Jaketehsnake> Hes deead Jim
<Meanwhile> My calm
<KwakLad> Ingwaz: they can but not everyone can afford the top of he range, so they will take what works and is affordable
<Meanwhile> She is starting to damage my calm.
<DaringDude> ironic theyre rescuing search and rescue
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The calm has been damaged!
<Meanwhile> Repair crews are en route.
<SonicRainboom> There actuallly are lasers, they're just not very common.
<Ingwaz> when going on dangerous missions, weapons are very important KwakLad
<prince-dari> It's life Jim but not as we know it not as we know it
<SonicRainboom> Only elite Alliance troopers use 'em.
*herostar returns with eggs topped with cheese
<derpy_pony> now you broke it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well point for you~
*Jim shrugpony
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> No you never move the thing
<Meanwhile> It's life Jim but not as we know it, not as we know it Jim.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> If you move the thing everything blows up
<Sundaysmile> oh it's Anya!
<Ingwaz> their weaponry is archaic, but they have space ships
<RoboGerbil> its the pax
<Meanwhile> Star Trekkin, across the universe...
<Coolbluemidnite_x> pacman
<Combustiblelemons> the paaaaaax
<Coolbluemidnite_x> pacman killed everyone
<Dermathil> nooooooooo
<Starflash> Its worse than that, it's the pax :T
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Like I said, nothing replaces guns.
<Dermathil> TT_TT
<derpy_pony> they died tripping
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> the haxxx ?
<prince-dari> Pax, pacis.
<prince-dari> Dat Latin
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> ...Except swords.
<Jaketehsnake> layed down and died
<Coolbluemidnite_x> i call hax
<Ingwaz> o.o theyre in america?
<herostar> ಠ_ಠ
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ahh. A lazy gas.
<Meanwhile> They were so calm they died.
<Telume> >_>
<KwakLad> Ingwaz: yes, having weapons that you can have that work is important does it matter if your enemy is dead and slumps to the floor or if your enemy dies and is thrown across the room by your weapon? not really as long as they die
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> If you had to chose between a gun and a sword for a fight, what would you chose?
<Meanwhile> How very mellow.
<Jaketehsnake> that is one damgaed calm
<Telume> I just noticed the topic lol
<Combustiblelemons> whoa
<monsterhunter> pax? THE PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX *throws a computer into space*
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> depends is te gun loaded ?

<Jaketehsnake> reavers?
<herostar> pax means peace
<Dermathil> THEY MADE THE REAVERS GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASP
<herostar> example
<DaringDude> damn
<Jaketehsnake> Called it
<Coolbluemidnite_x> beavers
<Combustiblelemons> the origins of reavers :o
<SonicRainboom> THE ORIGIN OF REAVERS.
<derpy_pony> rape scene
<Jim> Playing Terraria, gets pinged by "He's dead, Jim", look back on game and I died there ^^
<Meanwhile> And this is how reavers came to be.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Om nom nom
<herostar> pax romana, the roman era of peace
<Tovler> I think Battlestar Galactica had the best futuristic technology balance.
<Meanwhile> Jim never dies due to pings at home...
<DainbowRash> All your face r belong to us
<monsterhunter> A ZOMBIE
<Krakass> And that is how Equestria was made.
<Sundaysmile> lol daibow
<Jaketehsnake> Jim that was me, Im sorry bro, Ill pay you in terraria gold for what you lost
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol Meanwhile
<ApplejackDaniels> I lost the game
<DaringDude> FUUUUU
*Meanwhile hits ApplejackDaniels with a cinderblock.
<prince-dari> I lolled DainbowRash
<monsterhunter> weres the juggernaut and the speedcola when you need it
<d3rb> ew use a bucket
<Jim> Doesn't matter, had almost no gold on me and I got back anyways
<monsterhunter> wheres*
<d3rb> or the sink
<Ingwaz> indeed KwakLad, but, which is more useful, a pistol with ballistic shells, or a plasma pistol that uses ammo more efficiently and is more damaging, most likely stronger against armor as well
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> I lost the plot. Whats going on?
<Sundaysmile> she was the 10%
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Ding
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Damn that lazy gas.
<Jaketehsnake> Jim thats good, sorry to botheryou anyway
<Ingwaz> KwakLad: thats like saying that you are okay if you stick with a sharpened stick rather than a steel spear
<Jaketehsnake> Jim playing on a server or solo?
<Dermathil> NEXT MAJOR SCENE IS AWESOME
<RAWRity> Ingwaz: but which is easier to come by when you're flat broke and having to steal everything you can.
<Ingwaz> ding ding ding
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> XD
<RoboGerbil> quit dinging
<Jim> We're playing on a server

<DaringDude> yay an actual fight sequence
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Lets sing a song!
<Jaketehsnake> the bloom is so darned high
<Pegacorn> Hi y'all.
<Ingwaz> KwakLad: its possible you can kill them, but, your chances are better with a spear than a stick
*Nittany_Discord 11,01explodes
<KwakLad> Ingwaz: if i have to be ingenious with how i use the stick, then so be it
<DaringDude> ok my name is pinkie pie and i am here to stay....
<Meanwhile> 2 armies vs bitty cannon.
<Dermathil> YES
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Cannon
<Ingwaz> reavers, alliance, shepard...are we sure we're not watching mass effect?
<Dermathil> INCOMING AWESOME
<prince-dari> A...Party cannon?
<DaringDude> im going to make you smile and brighten up your day
<PAK215> I'm sorry, I've been gone for about an hour. Does this have a plot that I should know?
<Meanwhile> Itty bitty cannon is adorable /)^3^(\
<Combustiblelemons> *Rocket to the face*
<Dermathil> ingwaz, there aren't any reavers in ME
<d3rb> i hope nothing bad happens to him
<Dermathil> NOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<Ingwaz> Dermathil: it was a joke
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Ow
<SonicRainboom> Uh oh.
<Dermathil> I know ingwaz
<DaringDude> dat girl be fine
<KwakLad> Ingwaz: in the show they never claim to have the best weapons anyway, in the series its quite clear the alliance has higher tech weapons, but they are happy with and have their own weapons
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dat judas reference
<Coolbluemidnite_x> dat knife noise
<DainbowRash> He's such a meanie-pants
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aww: <
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Series? This is a show?
<Dermathil> hahahaa
<Jaketehsnake> oh noes
<Dermathil> yes
<DaringDude> not gonna b so lucky getting out
<Coolbluemidnite_x> movie of a show
<Purple`Prose> was a show
<ezio> hello
<Dermathil> Well the movie to a show
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was a show.
<flutter_spin> Firefly is the original series
<Dermathil> Firefly was the show
<Meanwhile> Ah yes "Reavers" The homocidal lunatics allegedly waiting near Miranda. We have dismissed that claim.
<ezio> was there a new episode today
<Dermathil> REAVER SHIP
<TopHat> WAS a show :'(
<KwakLad> Embodiment_Of_Awesom: its a movie based on a show called Firefly
<RAWRity> Embodiment_Of_Awesom: it's the movie conclusion to the series "Firefly"
<flutter_spin> Serenity is a movie that extends past the series
<PAK215> I never watched Firefly.
<RoboGerbil> zomg weve been spotted
<Marx> Get ready for this.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Oh so thats why he called it Firefly in the begining!
<Ingwaz> Meanwhile: slap that turian council member with a singularity

<DaringDude> Da hellll
<SonicRainboom> THIS IS THE ODDEST CHARACTER DEATTH EVER.
<flutter_spin> They REALLY wanted to end the Firefly series
<RAWRity> prince-dari: Reaver ship followed them. Fired big ass spike through the cockpit window.
<otakon> eeyup
<Meanwhile> Reavers use harpoons planetside.
<Combustiblelemons> he died from a zap?
<otakon> no
<Dermathil> giant harpoon from the reaver ship
<Sundaysmile> they had to end it
<Combustiblelemons> oh
<Sundaysmile> no more funding
<Combustiblelemons> D:
<otakon> GIANT FRIGGIN SPIKE
<Sundaysmile> it was cancelled
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Something fell and impaled him it seems.
<Ingwaz> so, is this supposed to be a sequel to firefly then?
<Combustiblelemons> damn that's evil
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: well, they HAD to. This was the last hurrah as it where.
<Dermathil> Nittany: nope, harpoon
<flutter_spin> yeah. Still sad :(
<Sundaysmile> PRAY they dont end MLP the same way
<otakon> Ingwaz: it's supposed to be the END of Firefly
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: No, harpoon from Reaver ship.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> NEVER!
<BlastHardCheese> They should put their faith in me
<SaturnPie> 08,01inb4 wash dies
<Dermathil> he's already dead
<Ingwaz> otakon: thats what i meant
<Meanwhile> Wash used to be a pilot like you, then he took a harpoon to the ribcage.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't see a harpoon.
<nekohime> Sundaysmile: I don't see MLP losing funding
<prince-dari> Lol Meanwhile
<Midnight_Tempest> SaturnPie is slowpoke
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Its 20% cooler than all Hub shows combined!
*otakon bricks Meanwhile
<Jaketehsnake> sundaysmile All good things have to end, I would like an awesome movie ending
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was dark.
<SonicRainboom> Too late, Saturn.
<BlastHardCheese> They should put their faith in me
<SonicRainboom> He just did.
<Meanwhile> Buff Drinklots.
<Dermathil> Nittany: the thing was a harpoon
<otakon> Wash is ded
<Combustiblelemons> wait if reavers breed does that mean their kids would be normal?
<Ingwaz> did he say go ram crates?
<RAWRity> Move the Gor Dam crates!
<RoboGerbil> i like the hookers leather armor
<Jaketehsnake> sundaysmile not for a while oar of episodes though
<flutter_spin> remember the little harpoon to the leg?
<Krakass> Gorram
<Combustiblelemons> i doubt a gas could alter a person's DNA :S
<otakon> Ingwaz: godamn in their pidgin
<flutter_spin> This was a big harpoon to the chest
<Meanwhile> Where's Big Mclargehuge when you need him?!
<Dermathil> Lemons: they don't breed, they make more people insane, actually.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Go Casey!
<Combustiblelemons> oh
<Ingwaz> what was that?
<Combustiblelemons> that explains it
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: he's racing space go carts on the Southern Sun
<Meanwhile> Ah ofc.
<SaturnPie> 08,01they're like rapey borg
<otakon> Combustiblelemons: it wasn't a gas, it was a chemical that was supposed to reduce violent tendencies.
<DaringDude> ^
<Jaketehsnake> oh hai sarutn
<Combustiblelemons> rapey zombies
<RAWRity> SaturnPie: more like rapey Klingons
<Sundaysmile> Resistance is futile *rape face
<Meanwhile> Borg are fairly rapey anyway what with the whole assimilation tubules.

<TopHat> DaringDude: nice name
<Ingwaz> wow lady...way to be a killjoy
<RoboGerbil> well i might
<DaringDude> thanx :)
<SaturnPie> 08,01RAWRity: i doubt they have honour
<flutter_spin> Well, sort of. It was "in the air" machine thingy but... yeah
<Meanwhile> Stay positive Jayne.
<Waffles> goldfish
<Combustiblelemons> no heavy machinery?
<prince-dari> >supposed to stop aggression
<RAWRity> Their job isn't to make everybody part of the Reavers. Their goal is to put a little bit of Reaver into everybody else.
<prince-dari> >makes people go completely insane and kill everyone
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it was chloroform~
<prince-dari> Seems legit
<Jaketehsnake> symbolism time
<otakon> eeyup
<Meanwhile> Scumbag scientific idea.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> ...
<SaturnPie> 08,01RAWRity: show me your honour
<Sundaysmile> he wanted to be with hookerbot 9000
<otakon> it's the doll
<Combustiblelemons> they should have tested it more thoroughly
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> I knew she was alive!
<Dermathil> hahaha
<otakon> she's just a bot
<Meanwhile> He killed me with a sword. How weird is that? :D
<Ingwaz> prince-dari: kind of like those asthma medicines which increase your chance of asthma related death
<Jim> He killed him with a sword
<ApplejackDaniels> A SMEX BOT
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<otakon> he recorded his last moments in his bot
<DaringDude> she damn fine
<Jaketehsnake> hookerbot is best bot
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> AD?!
<Combustiblelemons> that is weird as hell
<Combustiblelemons> the weirdest line ever
<Sundaysmile> SMUTT BOT is the Key

<Combustiblelemons> I'm suprised the reavers unite instead of tear each other apart
<DaringDude> y do i feel like the enemy guy is gonna fall into that fan below
<Ingwaz> stupid woman
<SuperBrony64> 10,02La la la la ^_^
<Purple`Prose> Ingwaz: because the bad guy works for the government, and the government doesn't want a riot
<RAWRity> Ingwaz: he doesn't know about the Reavers. He's just been hired to kill them and River.
<Meanwhile> Dat SB.
<Iwubponiez> hi SBA
<Waffles> not that again
<Jaketehsnake> SUDDENLY
<otakon> Combustiblelemons: I think it's a pheremone thing, they don't attack those who aren't reavers
<monsterhunter> BOOM HEADSHOT
<DainbowRash> SB enjoys it.
<Jaketehsnake> SB
<Ingwaz> you've let rage cloud your judgment

<BlastHardCheese> Waffles French Silk
<SaturnPie> 08,01so i just made an imgur album of all my posters for the music society, and i hate them all: http://imgur.com/a/MS0Rs
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Question. Why does the top say "RAINBOW DAHS IS BEST PONY" in rainboe letters?
<fillyfillyy> he is best dueler
<Combustiblelemons> texas stand off
<Purple`Prose> Malcolm Reyonlds is best pony
<Combustiblelemons> oops
<Krakass> Becaue rainbow dash is the best pony?
<CountDoofus> trying to draw a Harley Quinn pony... would she be an earth pony, unicorn or pegasus?
<Combustiblelemons> mexican*
<flutter_spin> FLYING KICK
<Combustiblelemons> derp.
<fluttercry> 05,15Because Dari says Rainbow Dash is best pony
<Midnight_Tempest> shot in back, can still climb... seems legit
<ApplejackDaniels> .
<SonicRainboom> XD
<RAWRity> Ingwaz: The alliance has claimed reavers are the result of people seeing the edge of the universe, and he says at the beginning that He's not interested in secrets, he' interested in keeping them.
<Ingwaz> i hope for her sake thats a torque bow
<Jaketehsnake> Embodiment of awesome why not?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And Dari is right.
<fillyfillyy> CountDoofus: earth pony
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> No reason. I was just wondering.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> because they mispelled twilight
<Combustiblelemons> damn how many reavers are on a ship?
<Meanwhile> Silly dari, that isn't how you spell Pinkie Pie.
<Jaketehsnake> nades tiem
<fluttercry> 05,15Though IMO Rainbow Dash is worst pony
<BlastHardCheese> Fluttershy is best pony
<Navy_Brony> shaving cream...future wound sealant

<monsterhunter> its left4dead all over again survive untill either help get there or bridge is down
<Sundaysmile> SHaving foam the miracle cure
<AttackWithHugs> SaturnPie: Your jazz poster had 3 different fonts.
<Krakass> Multiple ships.
<flutter_spin> 3 million on a planet. 10% turned into reavers.
<Combustiblelemons> meh i like RD
<prince-dari> Because Dash is best pony
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: worst pony? no. Worst of the Mane 6? yes.
<ApplejackDaniels> Fluttershy is Worst Pony
<Ingwaz> RAWRity: i'm just wondeirng why black guy isnt trying to stop the flesh eating maniacs
<Sundaysmile> either that or it's Mr Whippy
<Combustiblelemons> she's a loveable jerk
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> 9000. You did it wrong.
<Jaketehsnake> 300,000 reavers are not best pony
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Its, OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Jaketehsnake> dingdingdin
<SaturnPie> 08,01AttackWithHugs: only two, i think
<BlastHardCheese> silly Dari, thats not how you spell Fluttershy
<SaturnPie> 08,01apart from the society logo
<SonicRainboom> Rarity is worst pony.
<RAWRity> Ingwaz: his jobs to stop Mal. Then he'll take out whatever Reavers are in his way.
<nekohime> %fluttercry: I thought photo finish was worst pony
<RoboGerbil> Jaynes hit!
<DainbowRash> Noes. The faces!
<Combustiblelemons> >it's the future
<Ingwaz> oh...you guys are screwed now...
<Ingwaz> they have guns?
<pankreas> twilight is best pony. End of discussion.
<SonicRainboom> But that'ssn ot the point.
<Midnight_Tempest> then everyone died... THE DIED!!
<fluttercry> 05,15Nope
<Midnight_Fyre> Rainbow Dash is best pony. End of discussion.
<DaringDude> no sex for you
<Iwubponiez> everypony is best pony :P
<fluttercry> 05,15at least not for me
<AttackWithHugs> SaturnPie: Okay. I'm going to school for graphic design and the designer in me is kicking in
<Jaketehsnake> gthen Rarity was best pony
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: no. 30 million on planet. .1% became Reavers.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> No, its how you spell Twilight Sparkle.
<Combustiblelemons> >don't fire at ships till they're in visual range
<Waffles> whose best pony?
<RoboGerbil> agrees with pankreas
<fluttercry> 05,15I literally have NOTHING in common with RD
<SonicRainboom> Midngiht wins.
<Combustiblelemons> lowut
<Krakass> Comic sans is best font!

<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Most Illogical.
<Combustiblelemons> she seems more hyperactive now
<DaringDude> i have so much in common with pinkie pie
<Meanwhile> otakon: since they just moved into a dark corridor, yeah.
<Midnight_Fyre> Fluttershy is in season 2?
<SaturnPie> 08,01AttackWithHugs: no no, it's cool; if you actually know your shit then i'm all ears for anything you'd like to say
<Combustiblelemons> as do i daring :D
<RAWRity> Combustiblelemons: don't say that until you actually see her episodes!
<Jaketehsnake> Rarity ishbetpony in season 2 RD isbest pony season 1

<Purple`Prose> Summer Glau: psychic murdermachine in the body of a little girl
<Sundaysmile> it's like brony con when Lauren Faust visits
<Tovler> Teach the squirrels how to dubstep = costarring in an episode?

<BlastHardCheese> Fluttershy tamed a Manticore and made a dragon cry, you're argument is invalid
<otakon> indeed
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> They're Goku and Vegeta. They can take as much as they want.
<RAWRity> Ingwaz: because the experiment meant to weed out aggresion in people, but in .1% of the population, it had the opposite effect and made them go batshit angry rage monsters.
<Waffles> dead<<
<Meanwhile> your* BlastHardCheese

<Sundaysmile> Secret butt fun
<AttackWithHugs> SaturnPie: As far as fonts go, use one that goes with the feel of the poster, and the max amount on something you're working on is three. Though you're pushing it at that point.
<DaringDude> damn'
<RAWRity> Ingwaz: because rape can be about rage too.
<DainbowRash> He took an elbow to the neck

<DainbowRash> For some reason that fighting scene reminds me of Kill Bill
<fluttercry> 05,15that's 3 halves!
<TopHat> that fight scene brought me to tears
<Jaketehsnake> ^
<fillyfillyy> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: that would be 3 halfs of things
<TopHat> so beautiful
<Meanwhile> Half man half bear and half pig.
<fillyfillyy> i dont think you can do that
<Tovler> those guys should attack at the same time. That would get her.
<prince-dari> Meh, needs more Ip man fighting.
<prince-dari> :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> fillyfillyy: i know ~
<September> Srsly what was on the video The Operative watched just now?

<Meanwhile> Ip Man was awesome.

<RawketLawnchair> Hudda hudda dosh.
<otakon> fluttercry: eeyup
<SonicRainboom> They never had a chance/
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Where were you guys like 5 minutes ago?
<September> Lol shes like "Dafuq are you?"
<otakon> they don't stand a chance
<DainbowRash> Stop! You violated the River
<Waffles> oh nooo
<AttackWithHugs> and slaughter
<prince-dari> So what was the point in getting to this planet?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lad.
<Krakass> To broadcast the signal.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*lag
<Meanwhile> It's where Mr Universes equipment is
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nvm
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Bloodshot eye
<otakon> prince-dari: sending teh message out ot teh populace
<flutter_spin> the equipment to "send all"
<Waffles> <_<
<Sundaysmile> dat red eye
<Purple`Prose> So they could broadcast the recording of what happened to Miranda
<September> Dat FUture Tombstone.
<prince-dari> And sending the message did what?
<RAWRity> prince-dari: that planet had the tech they needed to broadcast that recording to the entire alliance's network, adn tell the populace about what they did.
<DainbowRash> They buried universe :o
<ApplejackDaniels> I want a snow globe grave
<Ingwaz> prince-dari: my guess is informed everyon
<RawketLawnchair> River remembered somethinged important on said planet, and they found the origin of the Reavers which was the Alliances fault.
<flutter_spin> let everyone hear of what the Empire did ... creating reavers
<Purple`Prose> Let the entire system know what about what happened
<Meanwhile> Reveal the origins of the Reavers to the universal population.
<September> Who's tombstone is the one with the rocket?
<fluttercry> 05,15I feel like watching this would make more sense if I saw the series
<Krakass> A snowglobe grave with derpy.
<SonicRainboom> ^
<RAWRity> prince-dari: it's helped to break the hold of the Alliance.
<flutter_spin> yep. You need to see the series
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Here here
<Stallion_of_War> What are we on?
<Combustiblelemons> that would be epic.
<Midnight_Tempest> only one place strong enough to send singals everywhere? seems legit... stupid future
<RawketLawnchair> The Alliance are dicks.
<Ingwaz> ding
<otakon> prince-dari: it told the public that the death of thousands and the Reavers were their fault
<Waffles> .-.
*Stallion_of_War he will ding four times
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aww. A 1 bottle rocket alute.
<pankreas> exactly my opinion, fluttercry, i didn't understand much too
<RAWRity> Midnight_Tempest: more like only 1 place strong enough that wasn't run by the Alliance.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*Salute
<nekohime> %flutercry: dunno, i've never seen the series but the movie was kinda straightforward
<AttackWithHugs> Oh god, is she using PAPYRUS?
<Sundaysmile> and let the shipping begin
*IshBestPony hugz and nomz everypony
<RoboGerbil> yay new paint job and firefly is fixed
<September> Where did they get the money to fix it?
<Jaketehsnake> Yup
<flutter_spin> The movie was a good standalone, but for more backstory - you need to see the series
<nekohime> Tho it is a little harder to follow the plot and the chat at the same time
<Combustiblelemons> indeed.
<prince-dari> Sexy tiems
<September> SEXEH TIME
<DaringDude> dat sex

<SonicRainboom> That's the Operative.
<September> How is he alive.
<TopHat> well he never existed in the first place

*IshSexiestPony is too sexy
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: Sounds cool. How's that going for you?
<fillyfillyy> so SonicRainboom you predicted the future pretty well back there
<fluttercry> 05,15I mean...it's WAAAAY to close
<AttackWithHugs> It's gotten to the point where our class would point out design errors automatically because our teacher taught us well
<DaringDude> oooh upthrust
<Krakass> Dat double meaning.
<otakon> fluttercry: you do know Nathan Fillion INSPIRED Drake's design right?
<September> fillyfillyy: He was here when the movie was streamed yesterday lol.
<RoboGerbil> whos flying the rust bucket?
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: surely you mean Nathan Drake looks like him.
<Snuffsis> Yea, not choosing Nathat to play Nathan would be a BAAAAD idea.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> sEPTEMBER: hE DIDNT DIE. tHE GUY PARALYZED HIM AND LEFT HIM FOR THE AREMY.

<flutter_spin> So River is ... Rarity?
<Navy_Brony> First rule of helicopters. Don't touch anything with your helicopter.
<Jaketehsnake> aLL CAPS iSHbESTpONY
<RoboGerbil> stay outta my shed
<SonicRainboom> Rarity's sane.
<Shizuka> 13the third rule of flying is: don't stop flying unless you're on the ground
<Sundaysmile> more like fluttershy/pinkiepie
<Combustiblelemons> river is batshit crazy rarity
<AttackWithHugs> because I love getting my hands dirty. which is why I chose graphic design.
<SonicRainboom> River is Pinkamina.
<RAWRity> River is Pinkamena
<AttackWithHugs> Play with ALL the ink.

<Navy_Brony> 7/10
<prince-dari> If the series was so popular why did it finish so quickly?
<Waffles> yay .-.
<Meanwhile> One does not simply have an intact ship.
<Jaketehsnake> WHat was that?
<Stallion_of_War> I just don't know what went wrong!
<otakon> Shizuka: can you help me?
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Im on a drug. Its called ponies.
<Krakass> Curse your sudden but inevitaable betrayal.
<Sundaysmile> at least it got over 5
*IshSexiestPony is a model and you know I mean, and he shakes his little tush on the catwalk
<Combustiblelemons> good point dari
<SonicRainboom> We shall calll this land.... this land.
<RAWRity> prince-dari: it became popular AFTER it was cancelled.
<Shizuka> 13didn't it not get popular until it was cancelled?
<flutter_spin> Fox didn't think that Firefly got enough views and killed it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was cancelled.
<TopHat> dis music
<fillyfillyy> no!!! the ad popped up right before that happened i have no idea what it was!
<fluttercry> 05,15didn't pay attention enough to vote/10
<ApplejackDaniels> 6/10
<AttackWithHugs> It will. there's money in that because people like shirts and customized stuff
<RoboGerbil> so what we watching next?
<FlutterMagic> t'was a nice movie

<flutter_spin> Fox did a horrible job airing the show.
<IshSexiestPony> Sexy/10
<prince-dari> Only famous when they're dead. The irony. XD
<Shizuka> 13it's the "did terribly on tv, did amazing on dvd"
<DaringDude> even though ii came in halfway through
<Coolbluemidnite_x> Dem credits
<RAWRity> prince-dari: it's one of those "Don't know what ya got til it's gone" kinda things.
<fluttercry> 05,15Also prince-dari Fox cancels good shows...to make room for family guy
<Combustiblelemons> nothing special but it's alright
<Meanwhile> Adam Baldwin/10
<Snuffsis> The series was only popular among people with a sense of quality, not the general public that like things such as jersey shore
<ThatsAShinySky> mlp time?
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> AD?!
<fillyfillyy> 6_9 /20
<Sundaysmile> agreeed flutter_spin
<DeadpoolDash> fox screwed up the episode order, had long breaks between episodes, changed the air days and times to much, etc.
<nekohime> later everypony
<flutter_spin> They rather have American Idol with 10million viewers than to have Firefly with 2million viewers
<ApplejackDaniels> ja
<MirrorImage> so what movies got picked for next week?
<Shizuka> 13aren't there only like seven episodes or something?

<Meanwhile> otakon: your internet gain sentience?
<Combustiblelemons> fluttercry fox is run by morons and half the people who watch fox are morons
<Midnight_Fyre> When was the last time Fox cancelled a good show? Heck, when was the last time Fox aired a good show at all?
<otakon> All my flash applications keep going white
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> otakon: Whats wrong?
<Tovler> 2 millions viewers? That's a low number by broadcast standards.
<monsterhunter> me love theme that plays when you battle dragons in skyrim i learned the lyrics

<otakon> Shizuka: okay, but I just updated
<fluttercry> 05,15When Fox cancelled arrested development...I was done with them
<Krakass> That's racist.
<flutter_spin> Fox had the same problems coming up with Simpsons... but I guess they worked that out
<Shizuka> 13sounds like a crash, or a plugin blocking them
*Midnight_Tempest is impailed by a harpoon. x.x
*IshSexiestPony licks everypony :3
<Midnight_Fyre> That was a while ago
<emangamer> IshSexiestPony is sexiest pony

*Lolz is licked?
<fluttercry> 05,15Arrested Development was one of the funniest shows EVER. And Fox killed it...for Family Guy
<Meanwhile> That isn't how you spell Princess Celestia emangamer.
<RAWRity> fluttercry: well, at least you're finally getting the movie?
<Combustiblelemons> there should be another channel like fox but for people who have a brain.
<Stallion_of_War> Princess Luna IshSexiestPony...
<AttackWithHugs> The only thing I watch on Fox is The Simpsons. Because there's other stuff on TV
*Theoboldi needs an Adult
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Arrested Development was meh.
<Shizuka> 13never saw arrested development
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Hey Family Guy is awesome!
<flutter_spin> Fox News. Enough said. :P
<emangamer> Meanwhile: that isnt how you spell twilight sparkle
<Shizuka> 13or... really any sitcom
<emangamer> Shizuka: DO IT NOW...its really REALLLY funny
<Tovler> and networks are still putting their faith in crap like Whitney while shuffling around The Community.
<Combustiblelemons> family guy is getting old :/
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Moreso now than before. The first few episodes were boring.
<Meanwhile> emangamer: because you know how to spell?
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: how dare you
<prince-dari> Don't think Arrested Development was really my thing.
<Shizuka> 13eman i have not watched TV since 2007

<Iwubponiez> can we have ponies now plz?
<emangamer> Shizuka: but its HALIRIOUS
<Combustiblelemons> it's funny every now and then but now it's just boring.
<emangamer> Shizuka: and besides you watch ponies...
<Midnight_Tempest> arrested development wasnt that funny... it was good, but not that great
<Shizuka> 13and even then i hardly watched it after 2006 when i got real internets
<Stallion_of_War> NO TV SINCE 2007! :o
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi
<Shizuka> 13sumica~
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> Shwos are better later on. When they start they're scared and have to play it careful. Then later when they're popular they just do what they want.
<Meanwhile> Allo Sumica
<Combustiblelemons> I don't watch TV any more.
<RAWRity> Really, at this point I know damn well that the Arrested Development movie, no matter how good or bad it is, will NOT live up to expectations of the fans.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I haven't actually seriously watched TV in years myself except when I was in Tulsa.
<Embodiment_Of_Awesom> XD

<Lolz> That's one horn to pierce through the whole book
<Combustiblelemons> ah this ep again?

<SonicRainboom> How does Spike digest gems?
<Shizuka> 13way way too much shakycam
<Yahooz> Cloverfeild :p
<flutter_spin> Cloverfield was a rental I thought.
<Combustiblelemons> he has epic stomach acid
<IshSexiestPony> Beetlejuice foar B movie
<Starflash> I thought Cloverfield was pretty funny. especially when you're already slightly amused *cough*
<Stallion_of_War> Floor = World's largest shelf
<Coolbluemidnite_x> spike is smart
<Shizuka> 13even on my monitor it's a bit much, and usually i don't get motion sick
<Tovler> Considering the insane hype for Cloverfield, it turned out pretty well.
<Meanwhile> Cloverfield would've been better with actual filming.
<fluttercry> 05,15Run dude!
<Midnight_Fyre> At least Cloverfield was supposed to look shakey. I can't stand movies that use shakey cam for no reason
<fluttercry> 05,15DUDE RUN GET OUT OF THERE

<IshSexiestPony> The llama is a quadruped which lives in big rivers like the Amazon. It has two ears, a heart, a forehead, and a beak for eating honey. But it is provided with fins for swimming. Llamas are dangerous, so if you see one where people are swimming, yell out, "Look out, there are llamas!"

<Ramirez> oh lawd
<Proud_Brony> The themesong has been activated!
<Eulshy> why is it sooo weird
<otakon> CriticKitten: eeyup
<CCCP> Meanwhile:
<Ingwaz> CriticKitten: since game stores aggressively sell used games rather than new ones, and theyre basically reselling a product they contributed nothing to, theyre making a huge profit while the actual game companies get none of it
<AttackWithHugs> Night, Meanwhile!
*EvilDiscord trolls AttackWithHugs
<SayWhat> Bye, Meanwhile
<bob> AND MAGIC MAKES IT ALL COMPLETE! AHHHHH!!!!
<CriticKitten> They have no claim over a product they already sold to another individual, it's that person's property at that point.
<RaveBrony> A Beautiful Heart!!!! <---best
<Everlasting_Joy> Night Meanwhile.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> night Meanwhile ~ sleep well
<Ingwaz> if they offered say 10% of the sale to the game companies, they would probably not have this problem
<KwakLad> night Meanwhile
<RaveBrony> Bye, Meanwhile!
<CCCP> 20%
<BritishBrony> AJ is completely honest. http://www.gameinformer.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Components-UserFiles/00-00-55-19-52-Attached+Files/4572.tumblr_5F00_lrocgkLILx1qfgjtno1_5F00_500.gif
<Saturn> 08,01fraaaaaaaaance
<Ingwaz> but many people are willing to wait a few weeks and buy a game used
*AttackWithHugs wonders how EvilDiscord will troll
<Proud_Brony> http://behance.vo.llnwd.net/profiles4/241989/projects/821814/bf06b0eb2f8d2ac9eea96390a0aea148.jpg
<fluttercry> 05,15oh are we watching part 2?
<CriticKitten> Ingwaz: But people bought the game to begin with.
<Proud_Brony> thats pinkie pies new baloon
<Dark_Horst> i never buy games used
<CriticKitten> It's not "used" until it's been purchased and played.
*EvilDiscord trolls with hand
<otakon> THE PINK.......ie Pie
<bob> meanie pie vs flutterbitch...scary
<fillyfillyy> the Pink....IE PIE!!
<CriticKitten> Which means the developer already got their money.
<AttackWithHugs> That line makes the song even better
<DainbowRash> So Elements of Disharmony go like this?: Deceit, Avarice, Cruelty, Betrayal, Sorrow, and Desolation﻿
<Midnight_Fyre> we should
<Capn_fisty> last time i was thiis dunk my friends saw me ploe dance on a washing line pole
<DaringDude> lol
<fillyfillyy> ninja!
<Ingwaz> indeed, but many more people will wait and buy it used rather than buying it brand new.
<Proud_Brony> NINJA RARITRY
<CCCP> why does fluttershy have to be shuch a bitch?
<Dark_Horst> if i blow money for a game i want to be sure the dvd is in prime condition
<otakon> DainbowRash: I believe so
<CriticKitten> They don't deserve money every time a game changes hands.
<bob> ninja ponies canon!
<Eulshy> wth is up with this?
<SayWhat> Is it me or is the sync a tad off?
<otakon> CriticKitten: agreed
<MirrorImage> I'm Q; I don't play fair

<DaringDude> i watched an interview from the guy who did the discord voice
<otakon> SayWhat: it is a bit off
<Dark_Horst> sound's out of synch
<CriticKitten> Should Blizzard come break my door down if I buy my friend's used copy of Starcraft off of him?
<DaringDude> said bronys were age range 25-55
<Ingwaz> CriticKitten: not all of the money, of course not, but i would say they deserve at least a small percentage of the sales
<Whiskra> I remember the week between return of harmony part 1 and part 2 was the longest week in my life
<Capn_fisty> dischord fer best pony
<Ingwaz> i love discord
<RaveBrony> Twilight is not smart pony :'(
<CriticKitten> No, they deserve zero dollars, because they have no claim over something they already sold to someone else.

<RaveBrony> ^
<d3rb_afk> books are canon
<DainbowRash> Lol FS
<Kipkat07> yes the is... :'(
<SayWhat> Mama so proud
<CriticKitten> When a product changes hands, that person who bought it OWNS it. They can do whatever they please with it. The original owner has no say in that and CERTAINLY doesn't deserve any profit from a resale.
<Dken2021> bunnies are cannon
<MasterBrony> STRIKE!!
<RaveBrony> Strike!
<RaveBrony> :D
<otakon> suddenly soap
<Proud_Brony> i ment to do that
<Ingwaz> so, its perfectly okay for a store, which had no part at all in the creation of a product which usually takes years, to buy said used product at an extremely low price, then resell the exact same product at a very high price and take all the profit from it?
<Tovler> *crap I meant Jem. I joke failed*
<RaveBrony> MasterBrony: (\
<SayWhat> Looks fun
<DaringDude> that would actually be fun
<Zappy> Soap roads? awesome!

<Darf14> Discord must watch a lot of inception
<otakon> Ingwaz: no it's not, but the way the publishers are going about it is wrong too
<Proud_Brony> Discord will be your gide

<Capn_fisty> twillight is biiiind"!!1
<Ingwaz> i didnt say they were right otakon, just that i see why theyre doing it as a reaction
<CCCP> Kipkat07: she will rise again
<otakon> Ingwaz: at the very least, you'd think they'd give you a third of the selling price
<Ingwaz> and i have to go for a bit, afk
<CriticKitten> Maybe if publishers didn't insist on their games being sold for 60 dollars, perhaps people wouldn't buy used.
<d3rb> mmmm toast
<CCCP> lag
<Eulshy> there is so many sounds that shouldn't be there
<RaveBrony> How do you all know when these random sounds occur?? Am i lagging? O.o

<Ziltoidian> freezy
<Ziltoidian> frozoee
<MasterBrony> it froze
<Proud_Brony> I'm laggin' to

<Smash_Lampjaw> hahaha\
<Kipkat07> CCCP: mabye youre right... :'(
<SayWhat> Fixing the sync
<MasterBrony> derpy has kept her eyes
<Ingwaz> CriticKitten: US gets games for extremely cheap, try buying a game overseas, you'll be begging for a $60 price tag
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and lawyers and doctors
<Smash_Lampjaw> that flower stomp
<CriticKitten> But the publisher loses all right to have a say the moment they sold it off.
<Proud_Brony> HERE COMES TOM
<Dken2021> hey, you think with all this arguing , it would've been a PM discussin?
<DaringDude> tom?

<fillyfillyy> so gray
<Proud_Brony> Ruin his finish! DO IT!
<CCCP> Kipkat07: u see i think derpy wont ever have a spaeking role again but the artist will find clever ways to hide her like they did in Hearts and Hooves Day
<Dken2021> hey, I don't like backseat modding, but you think you guys could take the debate in the PMs?

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> craft
<DainbowRash> FS deserved it
<Snuffsis> Mine!
<CriticKitten> But fact of the matter is, when something is sold, the original owner has no right to demand conditions be met on that product. They no longer own it. It's the customer's now.
<BritishBrony> I didn't. http://www.gameinformer.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Components-UserFiles/00-00-55-19-52-Attached+Files/4572.tumblr_5F00_lrocgkLILx1qfgjtno1_5F00_500.gif

<Ramirez> *grabs croll* BACK, BACK I SAY!
<RaveBrony> ^
<Capn_fisty> twill ight you need more overlords tto defend your book
<Snuffsis> lol pinkie
<Snuffsis> looking badass
<CriticKitten> If the customer wants to sell it to Gamestop for 5 dollars of store credit, and Gamestop then resells for 50 bucks, that's their choice in both cases. The publisher has no say in that, and if they want to curb it, maybe they shouldn't overprice their games in the first place.

<RaveBrony> Hehehe, its even funnier becuz spike doesnt even have wings.... :D
<CriticKitten> Ingwaz: Yes I can. If they're making a product less convenient for their day-one pre-order purchasers (which they are), then screw them and their "lost profits"
<Ingwaz> so...you're upset about the publisher choosing to charge $60 for their product but okay with the store only paying a fraction of the original cost?
<DainbowRash> So much troll here.

<Dken2021> Derpy is chewie
<Saturn> 08,01"Intellectual property (IP) is a term referring to a number of distinct types of creations of the mind for which a set of exclusive rights are recognized under the corresponding fields of law.[1] Under intellectual property law, owners are granted certain exclusive rights to a variety of intangible assets, such as musical, literary, and artistic works; discoveries and inventions; and words, phrases, symbols, and designs"
<pikorar> Lolwat?
<CriticKitten> And indeed most of the time when a company is pushed to court for facing an EULA situation, they would rather change the EULA than bother going to court.

<Smash_Lampjaw> No sad Luna!
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> Stop posting sad Woona winks
<Dark_Horst> rmemember the origin EULA fiasco? the first version of the EULA was downright a gangraping of the consumer rights
<Smash_Lampjaw> Happy Luna is best Luna
*Midnight_Tempest explodes
<CriticKitten> Anyways I don't particularly care myself. I tend not to buy things from companies that flip me the bird. :p

<Ingwaz> so...the company is wrong for making it so you have to buy a game new to access some of the content, but a store is perfectly right for buying a used game for a small amount and reselling it at a high amount and keeping all of the profits? the company is getting royally screwed
<Saturn> 08,01Dashie_Dashie: we need more Zeus Beefslam
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They still are consumer-right gang rapers.
<PrincessWoona> Hwi
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not my problem.
<CriticKitten> Perhaps everyone else can whine about it, but that's their problem because they're the ones who keep buying it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Publisher should take that up with the company.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe add bonuses to the new product.
<PrincessWoona> Nittany_Discord: NOT SAFE FOR WOONAA
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Hey all!
<CriticKitten> I stop buying from dudes who are trying to break into my wallet and steal from it.
<Snuffsis> The company is entirely within their right to sell second-hand. Just like there are entire car companies dealing with second-hand cars and such.
<Dark_Horst> the ONLY reason those companies loose money in ANY way would be that they made a shitty game
<Dken2021> heyo Scoot-Scootaloo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Instead of cutting content and holding it ransom.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03My mechanical Dog died :'(
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey Scoot-Scootaloo ~
<Dark_Horst> which is their own fault then
<FlutterDash> GOOD NIGHT EVERYBODY
<Ingwaz> so, screw the companies that make the game and spend millions of dollars making top notch games but give money to the stores who contribue absolutely nothing to the game and make a ton of money off used sales
<PinkiePieCopy> YES
<PinkiePieCopy> Move it down
<Saturn> 08,01Jim Hunkleg
<Dark_Horst> piracy doesn't hurt artists or software giants
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I guess.
<PinkiePieCopy> Now up
<CriticKitten> Ingwaz: Yup.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03He died helping me kill Legate Lanius :(
<Smash_Lampjaw> You know what I do if I dont liek or agree with something? I dont support it. You stop playing video games and show them big bad meanies whos boss! Meanwhile, I have Mass effect 3 and SSX to look forward to
<Saturn> 08,01Thud Stompmouth
<PinkiePieCopy> Move it up now

<otakon> prince-dari: you back yet?
<Dark_Horst> nor does re-selling
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just like publishers make money off of the hard work of developers.
<Dken2021> not the mech dog!
<PinkiePieCopy> Up more
<Tovler> Now, that I agree with. Gamestop can burn.
<PinkiePieCopy> A little more
<CriticKitten> If people want to keep selling to them, then by all means they deserve to make money.
<Saturn> 08,01Bark Redflail
<zackoroth> Piracy has been linked to helping because people try the content the decide to support it unless you suck
<PinkiePieCopy> nvm
<Dashie_Dashie> dat twilight based browser
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And fuck with free-market capitalism.
<Dken2021> oh look, gmod
<Dark_Horst> aw that one
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Both ends are crooked.
<Dark_Horst> that'S a nice vid
<Ingwaz> CriticKitten: hope you enjoy subpar games then, if i were a company and i couldnt make enough money to support the games i put millions of dollars in to, i'd stop putting so much money in to them
<otakon> lol
<otakon> guys
<otakon> GO INTO THE OTHER ROOM
<Ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: indeed they are, both sides are wrong, but many people are blaming the game company alone
<Darf14> The whole Piracy thing is very grey on this, so either way both sides loose
<Smash_Lampjaw> Allright the talk is about games, goodnight Everypony!
<otakon> the text walls are getting a little ridiculous!
<Midnight_Fyre> http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/346/6/2/comic_luna_by_ellispony-d4ix5s1.png
<CriticKitten> It's not Gamestop's fault that people are gullible enough to sell their games to GS for a pittance. That's the fault of stupid people. GS deserves to make money off of the stupid even if it's not moral. :p
<otakon> nigth Smash_Lampjaw
<Tovler> The whole Super-PAC thing means only republicans and corporate democrats can get elected.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, game companies aren't giving gamers reasons to like them.
<Snuffsis> DAH!
<otakon> GUYS! other room!
<Tovler> whoops I changed the subject.
<PinkiePieCopy> Dat heavy
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I never really liked gamestop. they keep asking me for game insurance.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03What the eff is game insurance?
<otakon> dat sandvich
<Ingwaz> lol Scoot-Scootaloo i bought game insurance a few times...never again
<PinkiePieCopy> What is it
<Dken2021> it's insurance to keep paying for their wallets
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> CAKE IS A LIE
<CriticKitten> But it's not a matter of right vs wrong, it's a matter of "are you really dumb enough to keep selling your games to them knowing they'll make absurd profit off of you?". And if the answer is yes, then nothing can stop them and nothing can save you. :p
<Tovler> game insurance is only good if you live with a bunch of toddlers
<Snuffsis> Game insurance is nice if you have a tendency to pick up your xbox and make it scratch the DVDS
<zackoroth> Oh on newer games discs are becoming more fragile 0.o
<Snuffsis> or scratch them yourself
<Drake> 04NS
<Drake> 04WAIT
<Drake> 04BRING ID
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: basically if the game stops working bc it gets scratched/damaged over normal course of use you can get a new copy to replace it
<Dark_Horst> like ubisoft's drm. limiting the reinstallation count of a game AND THEN programming it so crappy that something as simple as the change of a graphics card COUNTS AS ONE OF THOSE THREE REINSTALLATIONS???
<Midnight_Fyre> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/065/c/4/the_moon_among_the_clouds_by_luna_sedata-d3b2ign.png
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Back a half-decade ago, all you had to do to play a game was buy it and register it. You go the whole game.
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> Dat happy trail
<Dark_Horst> the fuck ubisoft? the fuck?
<PinkiePieCopy> Break Window Repair Window Break Window
<otakon> adn back though the SAME WINDOW
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sounds like its for Irresponsible 12 year olds
<Tovler> dude, I love Ubisoft. they're european
<Dken2021> who needs that anyway? it's not like you would be using your game as a frisbee
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> Diglet
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No limited installs, Steam/Origin, Ubi DRM, online passes, DLC, or other bullshit.
<Snuffsis> When DRM makes it harder for someone that actually buys the game compared to someone who pirated it. Something has gone wrong.
<CriticKitten> Scoot: So my brother
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, Steam was around 5 years ago.
<Ingwaz> i just think its ridiculous to be okay with, as you admit, a store doing something thats wrong, because hey, theyre making money. but a company that produces a product to use methods to encourage you to buy their product so they get the profits is completely wrong and should burn
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Maybe...
<Dark_Horst> anno ahs them
<CriticKitten> Ingwaz: No, not encourage.
<CriticKitten> You mistaken their intentions.
<Dark_Horst> for anno 2070 it's three installations only. after that you're fucked
<Midnight_Fyre> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/221/d/c/moonlit_tears_by_lifesequencebreak-d439699.png
<CriticKitten> They are not trying to "encourage you" to buy from them, they are trying to FORCE YOU to buy from them.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Online passes are not encouragments.
<Snuffsis> Like Black Ops, i purchased it with a few friends, we came home and wanted to play right away, but nope. We had to register through steam and download the entire game from stea. So the DVD was empty except for a manual+ key.
<Ingwaz> how so? with things like ME2, if you didnt buy it new, all you lost out on was some dlc, nothging special
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're punishments.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> get present, play with the box
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> good times
<Dark_Horst> imagine you have hardware troubles or gotta reset your system. one day you suddenly can't play aqnymore. maybe you made an upgrade once?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Don't even get me startted on online passes..
<Dark_Horst> then your money and the game is gone
<otakon> Ingwaz: you missed out on even the CAPACITY to get DLC of any kind bc of the Cerberus Network
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh, I forgot.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I can't play BF3 multiplayer even though I own a copy :(
<Dashie_Dashie> FOOTBALL
<Ingwaz> otakon: the dlc was not hugely game changing, you still had the product you paid for
<Dashie_Dashie> Why Scoot-Scootaloo?
<otakon> Ingwaz: Arrival is important to ME3
<PinkieCupcake7> POW POW POW NIET
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: let's watch some Red Dwarf
<Nittany_Discord> 11,015 years ago, a publisher couldn't lock you out of your damn game for any reason.
<Dark_Horst> scoot that seems to be a far spread problem
<Ingwaz> otakon: not required, me3 will explain it all if you didnt do it
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Someone used the code to play online!
<Wrek> 05i settign up stuff
<Wrek> 05its only to pass time
<Tovler> k, I don't think anyone knows what they are talking about in the main.
<Saturn> 08,01noice
<Snuffsis> I LOVE THAT SONG!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03i was SOO mad
<Dark_Horst> the engineering behind bf3 is an insult to the gaming community
<otakon> GUYS! TAKE THIS CONVO TO REGULARS PLEASE!!!!
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> Don't yo hate it when that happens to tyou?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Publishers are an insult now.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> don't really feel like talking about dmr and online passes ~
<Dken2021> what are you talking about?
<otakon> lol
<Dken2021> oh, nvm
<Ingwaz> i just dont get how its okay for a store to rip you off, but not okay for a company to do the same to preserve their profits
<Dark_Horst> i myself can play, but the internet browser based server platform is buggy as gell
<Dark_Horst> *hell
<Dken2021> the least they could do is take it to the PMs
<CriticKitten> Ingwaz: Didn't say that, read again
<Snuffsis> What make me mad is that people have been banned from their entire origin/steam accounts and locked out of all their games, jsut because something they did in another game.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Holding part of a game hostage to preserve profits is not ok.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01NEVER.
<otakon> guys
<Dashie_Dashie> we're in an age where anyone will do anything for $
<Ingwaz> well, its either that, or they make no profit
<Drake> 04NS damnit
<otakon> REGULAR ROOM TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION PLEASE!!!!!!
<Drake> 04answer
<Darf14> However on the other end without Publishers we wont have the games that we have today, hate it or not we need Publishers even though I dont like it
*otakon facepalms
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01otakon's right.
<Dken2021> ohai Pegasister16
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: thank you
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Tres bien
<Pegasister16> Hey!
<CriticKitten> I'm okay with a company ripping people off if they're seriously dumb enough to keep making the same mistake over and over again. I'm not okay with a company screwing ALL of their customers for the sake of annoying a few of them.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We don't need publishers.
<otakon> hiya Pegasister16!
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> Shhh, SOLDIER! is asleep
<Pegasister16> lol
<Snuffsis> HAha epic sax guy
<Darf14> fine, I will go to the regular room ....if I can remember :P

<Thunderpony> So this is what i return to O>O
<otakon> lol
<PinkySpice> o-o
<otakon> lol
<Ingwaz> i think the discussion is pretty much over regardless as its pretty obvious neither group intends to yield to the other group, and i have things i need to do
<Ingwaz> if you disagree with it, boycott it and dont buy it at all, thats all i've got to say on it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pretty much.
<Thunderpony> What?
<CriticKitten> Exactly. :
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've boycotted pretty much any AAA publisher.
<otakon> turtles!
<CriticKitten> *:P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So, already done.
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> I like tuh'tles
<Thunderpony> Digimon
<Dark_Horst> we could all grab a stick and fight to the death in a ring at the next bronycon
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: yes you have, have fun not having a hobby anymore
<PinkySpice> stuff is still coming out of that box?
<Dark_Horst> bets can be placed
<CriticKitten> Don't like, don't give them your money. I don't give money to people for things I don't like, simple as that.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01otakon: Indie gaming.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Will derpy get her voice fixed?
<CriticKitten> Indie gaming ftw
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: is still sparse and underpopulated
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Will bronies be content?
<Snuffsis> Indie gaming is very good.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't care.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Toon in next time on Dragon Ball Z!
<Dynamic_Brony> dem Gmod
<Ingwaz> Scoot-Scootaloo: depends on what you mean by fixed, hasbro already "fixed" it
<otakon> lol
<Dken2021> the world may never know Scoot-Scootaloo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't feel bad about supporting an indie developer.
<Ingwaz> oh, nvm
<Ziltoidian> dat DR2
<Thunderpony> Lol
<Snuffsis> I wouldn't say indie-market is sparse and underpopulated.
<Thunderpony> I know this reference
*Iota np: [Song: Pain (4)][Artist: Steve McDonald][Album: Highland Farewell (2000)][02m:43s/128kbps/Stereo]
<otakon> Snuffsis: it is on consoles that's for sure
<Iota> Drake: She's gone
<CriticKitten> Well except for some games. I'll still emerge from my shell of hipster-ness to play games like GW2 because ArenaNet are good developers and I'd happily throw money at them for extended periods of time whenever they asked me to.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03:D
<otakon> um WHA?!
<Drake> 04I realised
<Tovler> I just don't know what went so wrong
<Ingwaz> GW2?
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> wut
<Dken2021> I like the indie market, it's when they do nothing but pixels games is kinda lame
<otakon> suddenly hlemets
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Indie market's growing especially on PC.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Valve is helping out.
<Dark_Horst> Guild Wars 2
<DaringDude> only 43 kills in BTB halo
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> where is that store ! i want a point and shoot hat !
<RawketLawnchair> Good thing it was not me.
<Snuffsis> otakon: OH yea, compared to PC Definitely, but it is growing on consoles aswell.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And kickstarter.
<Ingwaz> ahh of course
<Dken2021> but I don't mind the pixels,
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Have you guys ever wondered about the future of gaming?
<otakon> Snuffsis: true but not fast enough
<Darf14> yes
<Thunderpony> Yes i wondered
<Snuffsis> Valve has great support for indie developers with Steam.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't really care anymore.
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> He hasa cart for that?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03We have all these games that look so lifelike and stuff, where else is there to g?
<Dark_Horst> i'll definately try GW2. it looks promising
<CriticKitten> Scoot: I used to wonder about the future of gaming but then I took an arrow to the knee.
*CriticKitten ducks
<Dynamic_Brony> spy!
<Tovler> I was gonna talk about how the Wii U will support indie titles, but I don't have any sourses.
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: eventually it will become all Digital Disturbution at an even higher price
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03CriticKitten: -_-
<Ingwaz> Scoot-Scootaloo: physical controls, rather than controllers
<Thunderpony> I used to make arrow to the knee jokes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The future is indie gaming on the PC and digital distribution.
<Darf14> I dont know, who knows what would happen to games during this generation
<Thunderpony> Then i took a mace to the face
<Dark_Horst> big red music button... i want one
<Snuffsis> Digital Distribution being more expensive is fucking ridiculous.
<Dken2021> the future of gaming is pixel art
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> she is dead
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or cloud gaming since publishers will have full control over their products.
<otakon> Snuffsis: it is, but that's how it's going
<DaringDude> lol
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Oh and it seems that EVERY new game that comes out is a shooter, or some combat oriented genre
<Thunderpony> Just as a fad
<Dark_Horst> murdering is in
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Only the ones that get press.
<otakon> Snuffsis: mfw GotY Fallout 3 is 40 on Steam but only 20 for a physical copy at Wal Mart
<PinkiePieCopy> And not a single fuck was given that day.
<Thunderpony> There will be new types of games coming out with the Wii U
<CriticKitten> Dark_Horst: Aye. I think if it came out as it is right now, it'd be the best game of this year.
<Darf14> To be honest, I am tired of shooters, unless it does something new and interesting to it then I would be interested in a shooter
<Dynamic_Brony> The derpy sitution solved
<Thunderpony> Nintendos comeback as a non-family oriented gaming company
<Thunderpony> Ninja Gaiden 3
<Thunderpony> All i gotta say
<Dken2021> I would add to the discussion, but this debate is getting a bit tiresome now
<otakon> oh god
<RawketLawnchair> See?
<Snuffsis> otakon: hope that in the futureu it will change. Since today it's only more expensive due to, if you believe TB, pressure from retail stores.

<Dken2021> all this discussion is boring me now, I'm otta here, bye everyone
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> in a way
<Dark_Horst> the reason so many games today go for bloody murder is that singleplayer gaming slowly goes instinct. it's all multiplayer on global contest. and that will keep getting bigger. and what's the best way of two teams to contest each other? stabbing, slicing, cutting, hacking, beating, shooting and blowing up each other

<Saturn> 08,01all of them
<Dynamic_Brony> that bastard
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> bummber
<Saturn> 08,01is this a dick move?
<Midnight_Fyre> how old? You might have trouble turning a profit if they are much out of date and not much under market price?
<KwakLad> Saturn: if capable of selling for profit then do so
<kenne88> again this sounds so familiar even the lyrics...where is this from
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Did this /savvy/ guy have curly pink hair? :3
<kenne88> oh wait thats why

<ekips> Saturn: It's a humane move
<Dynamic_Brony> true dat
<Midnight_Tempest> Saturn: your not a bastard, your a businessman... thats how the world works, you did good
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> if you feel bad about it you could always give them part of the money~
<Jack85> yes
<KwakLad> Saturn: ponies dont know what computers are right? then go with your human instinct and make a profit
<Saturn> 08,01Snuffsis: why is he a dick, though? is it not a legitimate cause to buy them? or are any of the others' motivations more legitimate?
<Midnight_Fyre> not a dick move though
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> but still is a business move
<TOY_PON3> I sure wish I had 5 bucks...
<Darf14> *puts on hunters hat* brb, going to get 5 bucks
<KwakLad> Only Saturn dont go above market value if possible
<Dynamic_Brony> It sounds bad at first, but at least the product isn't destroyed. It is still given to people that are still interested
<Snuffsis> Saturn: No no, it's a totally legitimate reason to do.
<Saturn> 08,01KwakLad: if i did, they wouldn't sell
*TOY_PON3 looks at crate keys and pouts :'(
<CuddlyKittens11> Hey guys.
<KwakLad> Saturn i know, but if you did then it would be a dick move
<Midnight_Tempest> Saturn: some people will think it was a dick move, others will think it was a smart move... all that matters is, do you think this /savvy/ man did the right thing?
<TOY_PON3> I just need two keys..

<Yahooz> Ohai LadyCanary ^_^
<Dark_Horst> i made that level with a taser and a pistol
<Dark_Horst> ...that's actually a lot easier
<Jack85> its a trappppppp
<Dark_Horst> people don't shoot you that often
<kirzstryfe> 1,3the game is more entertaining on a non-lethal sneak run
<otakon> and that's why you TAKE THE TOXIC FILTER FOR YOUR LUNGS!
<LadyCanary> Also, Saturn, for some reason everytime you come in I think of Sailor Saturn from Sailor Moon. My favorite sailor scout xDDD
<UnFoundBug_> kirzstryfe agreed, and easier usually
<UnFoundBug_> cept the bosses
<Dark_Horst> this makes me want to reinstall that game
<otakon> well Wrek has thrown that out of the window
<KwakLad> kirzstryfe: agreed trying to do non lethal is more fun

<YourLittleDashie> I'm to young
<YourLittleDashie> to drink
<PKlose> Ahhhh, Dues ex.
<unfoundbug> just holding that amount of liquid will be hard
