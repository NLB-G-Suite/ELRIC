<Dark92Whatever> flutteryay: LIKE A BOSS
<DeathFlames> and how the heck dose this look like a crying or tears face: T_T
<MLP_Brovakiin> flutteryay: Good job :)
<Prince_Blueblood> I saw someone wearing a DJ-PON3 shirt today
<robotdragon9> i have a health class thing to do....its basicallya survey
<Dken2021> flutteryay sounds like your teacher bribes for good grades
<AJIsAwesome> I still have to finish mine! :D
<Prince_Blueblood> I wanted to go over and randomly brohoof this stranger
<tSparx> DeathFlames: Well, if it has serifs on it, it doesn't
<flutteryay> thanks everypony
<Prince_Blueblood> then decided it would be way too weird
<AJIsAwesome> Prince_Blueblood: Nice!
<tSparx> DeathFlames: Those little things coming down off the sides of the top of the T
<KnifeH> Too many chats to keep track of!
<BladedWings> Prince_Blueblood: should have done it lol
<AJIsAwesome> Prince_Blueblood: You could've asked if they liked the show or just thought the shirt was cool.
*KnifeH bashes head on Scootaloo
<Wirisme> we need a stream to focus
<flutteryay> missing plugin SHIT
<tSparx> DeathFlames: But imagine that the top of the T is a closed eye, and the line going down from it is a stream of tears.
<KnifeH> I got a stream
<Prince_Blueblood> he was talking to someone and going the opposite direction
<KnifeH> .. in like.. 10 mins
<Prince_Blueblood> would have been pretty awkward to do it
<DeathFlames> no i mean its like l are the eyes of the face and this
<Dken2021> Wirisme what's wrong wiwth talking?
<Prince_Blueblood> also, I've never seen a non-brony wear a brony t-shirt
<DeathFlames> and this is liek the eyebrow of the face: -
<flutteryay> why wont the video work T_T
<Kawaii_icybeauti> The only good thing is my science class. Somebody wrote a Korn logo into the teacher's desk, and since I sit right infront of the desk and just stare at it.
<Wirisme> nothing
<Prince_Blueblood> that would be weird lol
<AJIsAwesome> No stream means more communication.
<Count-bleck> Twilight_Sparkle
*Dark92Whatever So what does Rainbow Dash in a normal life..........make this PMV! LIKE A BOSS http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omFG-MHqWw4
<tSparx> KnifeH: Did a mod give you permission to stream? How unusual :)
<Brad[Laptop]> Prince_Blueblood its weird not to brohoof him.
<robotdragon9> my brony friends saw the derpy shirt i got over the summer. they are trying to convince their friend to join the herd and said "(my name) is wearing a brony shirt, why not u?" lol
<Prince_Blueblood> lol
<hgbguy> teleporting toaster tasers
<Prince_Blueblood> I look like a grumpy old man
<SafariMonkey> Dken2021: 10 different conversations happen at once (not that that doesn't happen anyway)
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dark92Whatever: I love that one!
<KnifeH> Prince_Blueblood: I have, cause I bought it for him and told him "If I get you this job, you have to wear it once every week
<Prince_Blueblood> so I'd look weird in a brony tshirt
<KnifeH> He's still holding up to his promise.
<Prince_Blueblood> lol
<flutteryay> brb
<Dken2021> DeathFlames well the Ts look like crying eyes to me, just saying

<Michael> ohai everypony :)
<Manearion> Because they are not really meant to write with as a language!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Dark_Horst: & PillowPoni Thats not funny guys :(
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Michael

<Wrek> 05but you can help me correct it later anyways
<BladedWings> hi Michael
<Everlasting_Joy> "None shall pass!"
<Manearion> Thing with germanic is they never actually used them to write with, as they where more of magic signs.
<Manearion> Yepp!
*Michael hugs MLP_Brovakiin BladedWings
<Dken2021> ello Michael
<Dark_Horst> ...did one of them steal his chestplate from a conquistadore?

<Applejack2012> hello
<Manearion> They had sounds connected to them, sure, but writing came later, and was probably inspired by the arabs to a degree.
*Dken2021 hugs Michael back :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> PillowPoni: Its not funny when the biscuit falls into the tea though...

<BladedWings> hi Sweetie_BOT and God
<MLP_Brovakiin> PillowPoni: Wait, you dunk biscuits in carbonated drinks!?!
<Everlasting_Joy> Dken2021: Don't forget the gladiator helmets.
<Michael> ohai God and Sweetie_BOT
<God> hi MLP_Brovakiin
<Ryunosuke> nords = vikings, redguards = arabs
<Applejack2012> good evening
<thelonepony> hi God
<MLP_Brovakiin> Wasup God
<God> hi Micheal
<Manearion> Did you know there has only ever been found one viking age helmet in all of Scandinavia?
<God> notin
<Dken2021> biscuits and tea? sounds silly
<thelonepony> hi Sweeti_Bot :)

<PillowPoni> MLP_Brovakiin: No, but I've had one fall in my drink. That drink went into the sink
<Manearion> ONE
<Manearion> HELMET
<Sweetie_BOT> hi
<Dark_Horst> kinda looks like something i saw in acentral european history museum
<Manearion> In all of Scandinavia, from the viking age.
<God> what am i watching sirously
<Dark_Horst> 13th warrior
<God> some viking movie???
<Wrek> 05God: you wre already told what you were watching
<Manearion> And it did not look like these guys's-
<MLP_Brovakiin> PillowPoni: Oh god, that wouldn't even be worth salvaging
<God> yes but idk what that is
<Wrek> 05stop asking a dumb question that you've arleady gotten the answer to
<Ryunosuke> as ironic as it seems
<Dken2021> Manearion it didn't have stereotypical horns on helmet did it?
<Manearion> The thirteenth warrior.
<Ryunosuke> God is trolling us
<Manearion> Nope xD
<MLP_Brovakiin> God: Long time no see, how are the wife and kids
<PillowPoni> MLP_Brovakiin: Nope. Poured it down the sink, and got more soda.
<Manearion> They never did~
<Dark_Horst> God: you wanted the name of the movie, that is the name of the movie. everything else should be obvious. if you want plot narration, askw ikipedia
<Wrek> 05Dken2021: common missconception. the horns were ON the actuall vikings. not a part of the helmet
<tSparx> God: if you're not really omniscient, then Wikipedia is
<Wrek> 05monthy python proves this
<Manearion> They drank from them and played music on them.
<Everlasting_Joy> Wait, so what you're telling me is, Mel Brooks was right as well Wrek?
<Michael> dat advice
<Manearion> Never had 'em on helmets!
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: that's from hägar, isnt it?
<Wrek> 05Everlasting_Joy: im still waitign for jews in space
<Dken2021> me too
<Manearion> Horns on helmets is from eighteenhundreds nationalistic paintings.
<God> my speakers suck
<Dark_Horst> oh, python

<Manearion> And it stuck....
<PillowPoni> All that blood......
<Michael> dat is al lot of ketchup
<Dark_Horst> well hung ham is best ham

<PillowPoni> Oh my lord is that a foot?

<PillowPoni> Or a hand?

<KnifeH> CrimsonPhoenix: Well, I would love to stream on BronyState once a week

<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Oh. Sorry, then I can't really help you then. :$

<Vivix> Aw ;__;
<dynamo2814> have you evver noticed that after playing the 3ds for so long it stops looking 3d
<Pyroid> is anything on right now?
<AJIsAwesome> Bunny_Striker: You'll do great. :)
<KnifeH> CrimsonPhoenix: Every community need more arts :3
<AJIsAwesome> dynamo2814: I never got the 3d to work anyway.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and yeah the mod team is pretty full
<dynamo2814> thats a shame why doesnt it work
<Brad[Laptop]> Vivix does this help you? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7923401/i-want-to-detect-whether-the-right-or-left-mouse-button-is-down-during-a-mousemo
<Vivix> what about you Brad[Laptop]? Specifically using addEventListener on "mousedown"
<Quick_Thinker> im planning on after being here for a long time maybe try out to be a mod and then work my way up but who knows
<Shizuka> 13you don't work your way up
<Shizuka> 13there is no up
<dynamo2814> what do mods do anyway
<Brad[Laptop]> Vivix why not just trap the contextmenu event?
<Obsidian> Ohi Shizuka
<Brad[Laptop]> oncontextmenu
<Cades> did eldude say anything before he left?
<Vivix> hm--
<Shizuka> 13dynamo2814: see the page you're looking at and all the pages it links to, that's what i did
<Unnr|Riding> dynamo2814: Keep order, stream content, work on the site and its backend
<Vivix> I'm terrible with JS- so that might work if I read up on it
<Brad[Laptop]> Vivix do some research maybe it will help
<Bunny_Striker> fucking brother took the last of the mac & cheese.I LOVE MAC &
<dynamo2814> oh ok, just curious
<Vivix> what I'm doing now is just trying to get a button value from addEventListener- but it seems it always returns 1-
<Unnr|Riding> If you want to hear an angry rant, just ask Phase4 about wordpress.
<Bunny_Striker> CHEESW :|
<Ponies47> Hey everypony! :3
<Bunny_Striker> wrong face
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Hi! :)
<Bunny_Striker> :[
<Phase4> 00,02Unnr|Riding, :<
<CrimsonPhoenix> Unnr|Riding, or ask me about Rin-Chan
<Bunny_Striker> better
<Dken2021> wordpress is that much of a hassle?
*Bronysith glomps Phase4
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rina-Chan***
<Brad[Laptop]> Vivix oncontextmenu = left click, regular mouseclick would be the normal event, so yu will have two events with two handlers.
<Unnr|Riding> Phase4: You know it to be true
<Brad[Laptop]> In theory at least...
<Shizuka> 13wordpress is hell
<Shizuka> 13just know that
<Phase4> 00,02^
<dynamo2814> anypony here like hunger games?
<Phase4> 00,02i've no time for rants right now though
<Shizuka> 13if you ever have to build a site capable of handling 75000 hits in half an hour
<Brad[Laptop]> never seen it.
<Shizuka> 13don't use wordpress
<Unnr|Riding> Agreed, shizu
<Phase4> 00,02infact avoid php
<Brad[Laptop]> I <3 php
<dynamo2814> how bout reading it
<Unnr|Riding> php has its occasional uses
<Applejack2012> hi
<Brad[Laptop]> Its nice for lazy coders like me.
<Phase4> 00,02it really doesnt scale to this size without multiple machines
<Unnr|Riding> but yes
<Obsidian> wb Applejack2012
<Phase4> 00,02Brad[Laptop], :<
<Brad[Laptop]> lol
<Vivix> Brad[Laptop], ookay- hm that might work, thanks! /readsmore about that
<CrimsonPhoenix> Also I hope the staff in MLD the movie will find a better voice than Rinuh-Chen for Rarity
<Bunny_Striker> I`m going to get trucked in football tomorrow morning...
<Phase4> 00,02Brad[Laptop], look at ruby python and javascript
<Vivix> I've dabbled in programming a lot, but whenever I want to do something I have to relearn everything
<Phase4> 00,02those > php
<Bronysith> Phase4: no hugs?
*Bronysith glomps Phase4
*Phase4 00,02hugs Bronysith back
<Bunny_Striker> *football training
<Ponies47> All the Phase4 color :P
<Applejack2012> Phaser set to hug
<Phase4> Ponies47, well now you ruined it :P
<Phase4> Back to my physics!
<Bunny_Striker> SET PHASERS TO HUG!!!!:[
<Applejack2012> MLD the movie?
<Brad[Laptop]> Phase4 already have, tried ruby, didnt like it, dont know much aboyt python but have modified the occasional script, I feel that php is more mature as a server side web dev language than python, for javascript you could use node.js which I have heard is good, but kind of prefer to stick with what I know for now.
<Vivix> Hiya Phase4
<alexxm> is that actually happening Applejack2012
<dynamo2814> im sad guys i lose the hub tomorrow, i feel like its just in time for season 3 too
<Bunny_Striker> Applejack2012: My little Donkey??
<Brad[Laptop]> dynamo2814 internet is wonderful.
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: It's already happened.
<Ponies47> Phase4: Ewww a naked Phase4 D:
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: It's a fandom movie.
<Dken2021> dynamo2814 you still have us, whenever season 3 will start
<BronyInstrumental> Hey guys :)
<Ponies47> Hey BronyInstrumental
<AJIsAwesome> BronyInstrumental: Hi! :)
<Dken2021> hai BronyInstrumental
<Applejack2012> hi
<Obsidian> Hey BronyInstrumental
<Phase4> Brad[Laptop], i can understand that but its really time to move away from php, webs large enough and apps are complex enough that its becoming the bottleneck
<alexxm> AJIsAweosme i guessed it was a brony thing is it good?
<Bunny_Striker> oh shit, ROOTBEER HATES ME!!!!BRB!!
<alexxm> how you doing BronyInstrumental
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: The movie? I don't know. The fanfic? It's okay at best.
<dynamo2814> true but, report cards are coming out and i dont know how good/bad ive done and mom likes using the ground hammer on me....alot
<Brad[Laptop]> Phase4 Ive heard some bad things about scaling ruby, especially with the issues twitter had with its growing stages.
<BronyInstrumental> I'm good, alexxm, pretty tired. You?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/dAa6bOWB8qY MUST WATCH http://youtu.be/dAa6bOWB8qY
<Dken2021> insolent fool ,rootbeer is incapable of hate, it's the necter of the gods!
<CrimsonPhoenix> woah double linked
*LadyCanary yawns
<CrimsonPhoenix> sorry about that
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: The fanfic is overrated but it's still a good fanfic to read.
<alexxm> i'm good BronyInstrumental
<Ponies47> Sleepy LadyCanary is sleepy :3
<LadyCanary> =_=
<Phase4> Brad[Laptop], i've read about those too, tbh i've not used ruby for web dev, BerryPunch is written in ruby and its been fun working with it
<Brad[Laptop]> Phase4 whats berrypunch?
<Phase4> irc bot
*Bronysith gives LadyCanary a box
*LadyCanary throws the box at Bronysith
<Obsidian> Ohi LadyCanary
<Brad[Laptop]> Phase4 the thing I dislike about php is that it doesn't thread as a cli app
<Dken2021> ello there LadyCanary
<thelonepony> LadyCanary looks so cute when shes sleepy
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: there were muffins in the box
<LadyCanary> ...:I
<BronyInstrumental> Ponies47 sleepy BronyInstrumental-using-a-phone is also quite sleepy =_=
<Unnr|Riding> LadyCanary: Did you see the new Arrow, black canary surrogate promo?
<LadyCanary> You dont even know what I look like.
<Phase4> Brad[Laptop], not sure what you meen
<LadyCanary> ...Wait.
<Brad[Laptop]> Phase4 I wrote a irc bot framework in php, but the problem is it doesnt thread, so its not as efficent as I would like.
<Ponies47> BronyInstrumental: It's only 6:38 PM here :P
<thelonepony> i know
<LadyCanary> NO. NOT DINAH. NOT MY WIFE.
<LadyCanary> Unnr|Riding: Link. Now.

<Dken2021> Ponies47 don't worry, after highschool, only a select few will act like that
<CCCP> Ponies47 im sorry :(
<scout19_tf2> brb gotta got to lunch cya everypony
<Obsidian> Later scout19_tf2
<Ponies47> Dken2021: True.
<tSparx> Dken2021: What the hell college do you go to? I should enroll :$
<CCCP> i talk too much in lunch... :s
<Brad[Laptop]> Ponies47 after highschool, 95% of them dont act that way anymore.
<Ponies47> CCCP: It's ok
<PillowPoni> tSparx; lolol silly. When i talk on my phone it takes me off the wifi
<Ponies47> Brad[Laptop]: Good :P
<shibaru> That I steth myself with my ipod and he tells me he hears it when obviously he doesn't .w.
<Brad[Laptop]> Ponies47 the 5% that do you want nothing to do with.
<tSparx> PillowPoni: It happens :P
<Applejack2012> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4TedkQP_hM
<PillowPoni> tSparx, that it does
<Ponies47> Brad[Laptop]: Exactly
<Brad[Laptop]> Ponies47 eventually they discover highschool was nothing but an illusion and nothing they learned socially really matters in the real world.
<tSparx> A solid 40% of the girls at my school still act like that -- admittedly, about 3/4ths of those women are underclassmen, but still, annoying, haha
<tSparx> Oh, and guys have only gotten more annoying >_>
<CCCP> Highschool is pointless you learn more looking through a trash can
<Dken2021> it is mostly freshman thaty act like that anyway
<Brad[Laptop]> CCCP agreed.

<Applejack2012> Yup CCCP
<CCCP> Dken2021 brony state is pony related though...
<Ponies47> Awwww. Ponychat doesn't work on my phone :(
<Dken2021> CCCP would you imagine all the hits that will generate?
<AJIsAwesome_> I think we have all the coverage we need.
<alexxm> huh how come Ponies47
<Applejack2012> Give her a hand

<Bunny_Striker> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFldBVWFgWo... now, boot to the head
<Obsidian> They only post B state when we're streaming new episodes
<Ponies47> Anypony here have a Smartphone? I'm thinking about getting one. Does the chat work on them?
<Dken2021> this site usually gets coverage when there's new episodes streaming
<tSparx> The Commodore 64 had a storage capacity of 36 kilobytes. For reference, that's about *how much data you kneed to store a .jpeg /of/ a Commodore 64*.
<Dark_Horst> and that day bronies advertised for office.furniture

<Ponies47> Marco: Polo :P
<Marco> c:
<Marco> that reminds me of my friend orger who created the bot flootershai with a "POLO" module just for me!
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: You'll have to excuse flutteryay, I don't think he/she knows how becoming a mod really works.
<Marco> it's in #bronyism if you want to spam it

<otakon17> What flavor?
<AJIsAwesome> Here's some relaxing music to keep you company. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_ApqHTDrRE&feature=relmfu
*otakon17 covers his head
<tSparx> inb4 metal
<Bronysith> otakon17: boot to the ass
<CyborgBunny_Striker> CHAT Y U NO LET ME US Bunny_Striker?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
*Bronysith throws a boot at otakon17 s ass
<otakon17> Ouch!
<HatsuneMikuFan> Here is a noob question: I recently bought CS: GO and everytime I aim at someone, they kill me, I see their health bar and it looks like they did not take any damage. Now the question is how do you aim? In other words, how do I become good at CS? I know standing still makes your aim better and crouching is the best way to aim, but they are not taking damage. I need some pro tips.
<CyborgBunny_Striker> *use
<Ponies47> Dat wall
<HatsuneMikuFan> Sorry
<AJIsAwesome> HatsuneMikuFan: Do you hear gunfire?
<HatsuneMikuFan> Yes
<AJIsAwesome> HatsuneMikuFan: What weapons are your enemies using?
<CyborgBunny_Striker> my chat is a dick
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Oh you weren't lying. Sorry, my life of Internet browsing has led me to believe that I was about to run into a wall of sound xD
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, Implying this isn't the ultimate relaxing music
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx6nOkdeNKs
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: I know. There can be no ultimate. :D
<CCCP> Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day fritter and waste the hours In an off-hand way
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Lying about what?
<twilight_sprinkle> HatsuneMikuFan: tbh i havent played cs:go but from cs:source i can give you a protip that strafing is important. you need to move side-to-side and shoot at the moments when youre not moving. as for what youre describing, idk
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: "Calm relaxing music" -- I thought this was going to be metal :P
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: As nice as Jolly Roger Bay is, I think it's a little overrated.
<Applejack2012> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK9mevXpDXU

<CrimsonPhoenix> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/6130/
<CCCP> tSparx :D!
<twilight_sprinkle> HatsuneMikuFan: did your gun even shoot?
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: DOn't get me wrong, it's a FANTASTIC piece of music, but I think people may have their nostalgia goggles on a little to tight.
<AJIsAwesome> *too*
<twilight_sprinkle> HatsuneMikuFan: like did you see muzzle flare?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and here I thought I was mister overrated
<brony2447> AJIsAwesome: what song yall talkin about?
<HatsuneMikuFan> AJIsAwesome: Mostly AK, Famas, awp, Deagle, Aug, M4, Gallil, that is what i see most people use
<tSparx> CCCP: no no, thank *you*, always love to see random Floyd lyrics quoted without prompting :D
<alexxm> so anyone seen this weeks newsletter cause i thought it was pretty funny
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: And did you realize that in that shot that it looks like Sweetie Belle is eating the bush? :D
<CCCP> tSparx XD lol
<HatsuneMikuFan> twilight_sprinkle: Yeah it shoots.
<CCCP> Is there a stream?
<Obsidian> alexxm: I did :)
<tSparx> alexxm: It exploded at me. Fluttershy must've been TERRIFIED to read it
<CCCP> Hello HatsuneMikuFan *hugs*
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, I noticed the leaves but meh
<AJIsAwesome> HatsuneMikuFan: I think those weapons are known for hard hitting and rapid fire. That's why.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi CCCP!
<twilight_sprinkle> HatsuneMikuFan: so maybe you didnt hit them? or maybe they had armor? in previous counter-strikes people used to still take some damage in armor, just less
<CCCP> so theres no stream? :S
<HatsuneMikuFan> AJIsAwesome: I'm using those weapons too.
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: Not now.
<CCCP> :o

<CrimsonPhoenix> Holy mother of all suns
<twilight_sprinkle> HatsuneMikuFan: well like i said, ive never played cs:go, i only played cs:source. but among other things i recommend you always aim for the head and keep the aim at head level. also it helps to know the layout of the level so you can move without thinking about the walls. also, in cs:source when you jumped you lost a lot of accuracy so generally jumping and shooting is a bad idea
<tSparx> dat wall of text
<CrimsonPhoenix> but hey AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Yes?
<CrimsonPhoenix> This is my personal preference for relaxation http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMnrl0tmd3k
<twilight_sprinkle> HatsuneMikuFan: and also in later stages of a match i recocmmend you constantly check all around you for enemies, so when running occasionally like behind you
<brony2447> SQUEEE!
<HatsuneMikuFan> twilight_sprinkle: Another thing is that I am getting kills and I go 5-8 at most game but it just seems like I am not hitting them when I looke at their health bar.
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: :D That's an epic burn! :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> epic burn?
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Your post.
<twilight_sprinkle> HatsuneMikuFan: yeah thats weird, might be a glitch or something. that only happened to me in cs1.6, i shot them but it just went through them. its a glitch, but it was fixed a long time ago afaik. idk about what youre saying
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just wanted an explanation for epic burn
<brony2447> i prefer silversun pickups lazy eye for relaxation
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: I've heard this song. It's very nice to listen to.
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: i just meant that it was funny. :D
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: The tumblr post, not the relaxation post
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Maybe I should be careful with what I mean to say. :$
<CrimsonPhoenix> oooooooooooh
<CrimsonPhoenix> now I get it

<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: What do you mean?
<twilight_sprinkle> HatsuneMikuFan: nah, pc shooter multiplayers are better
<tSparx> HatsuneMikuFan: PC accuracy >>>>> Console accuracy in FPS

<tSparx> DocSane: I feel that a lot of people thought "Oh, dubbing over ponies, that's funny!" and no, by itself, that is not funny, it's *what* you dub over the ponies that makes it funny haha
<crazypony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQ0CraHMKc&feature=plcp
<DocSane> tSparx: PA2 is still clever and well-produced, but there's just too much of it.
<tSparx> DocSane: like I said, it's still great :D
<Reflexonation> Any of you bronies here play minecraft?
<HatsuneMikuFan> twilight_sprinkle: I like PC and console. I'm just lucky that I got this gaming laptop as my High School graduation gift.
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Wow, this is pretty good. :O
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dr Dissonance is awesome
<twilight_sprinkle> HatsuneMikuFan: wow, thats one hell of a gift. as for consoles, i never had one besides the psp and gameboy. some games are better on consoles maybe, but multiplayer shooters are not them
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Thanks for showiing me him. This is very nice. :O

<CrimsonPhoenix> tSparx, your point?
<DJ_POn-3> AJIsAwesome: here is a basic tutorial http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO_8SLUpUWc
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hatsune Miku is considered a pop star in Japan while Ponies are just characters
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: That this Hatsun lady doesn't need to be real to have fans
<flutteryay> bored :/
<CrimsonPhoenix> tSparx, I don't mind her having fans...I do mind her being considered a Pop Star
<Kandarihu> Hatsune Miku is a voice itself.
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's a computer generated voice
<tSparx> I consider Pinkie Pie a pop star -- haven't you heard her latest single, "So Watch out!"
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's autotune in its purest of form
<tSparx> :P
<flutterchu> HatsuneMikuFan: tp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVAh_RYNJ6w phoenix iz best attorney
<thelonepony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NylmdC_uEM
<HatsuneMikuFan> CrimsonPhoenix: That's how i feel too, but her music sounds pretty good.
<CrimsonPhoenix> tSparx, I really do not see what you're trying to do in your arguments
<thelonepony> for the giggles
<superretroworld> guess im the only survivor :(
<thelonepony> survivor of what?
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: Forgive me, sometimes I mean to deliver a joke but do it in the form of an argument instead.
<CrimsonPhoenix> HatsuneMikuFan, just keep in mind that you won't ever be able to get Hatsune's autograph
<tSparx> on accident*
<HatsuneMikuFan> flutterchu: The link is not working
<Brad_> what is the "My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic: Adventures In The Crystal Empire" dvd supposed to be? a collection of previously aired episodes right and not something new?

*Dovah is sceptical.
<Cypresswolf> Much easier to keep in contact with loved ones now than when I was growing up, all I had was letters & phone numbers
<flutteryay> flutterwonder
<flutteryay> eeeeeeee thai deep wonder deep
<Shizuka> 13http://youtu.be/PWxLh9hcwSs did somepony say hatsune miku
<flutterchu> the end is halarious
<flutteryay> :$
<flutteryay> EEEEEEEEE MY BIG BRO ON
<Ryunosuke> flutterchu, LOLD
<CrimsonPhoenix> My opinion on Hatsune Miku: I get what she is and I do enjoy her sometimes but
<CrimsonPhoenix> how did it became something like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTXO7KGHtjI
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so i just picked up NSMB2,and its pretty fun.the coin thing is crazy lol global coin total was 50,623,432,181 0_o
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sketch_Toku_Brony, any new music?
<CrimsonPhoenix> any new enemies?
<Garettbrony> Who here is addicted to TV Tropes?
<JESmith71> CrimsonPhoenix: Nope
<Spectrum_Rush> CrimsonPhoenix: how in the hell didi that happen... she's... she's just a program for petes sake
<thelonepony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0l28Qmj9MY&feature=related
<HatsuneMikuFan> CrimsonPhoenix: i like this song
<Dovah> Garettbrony: NOOOOOO!!!!!!!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Spectrum_Rush, your guess is as good as mine
<CrimsonPhoenix> HatsuneMikuFan, it's not the song I want to show
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: I'm guessing the fact that we as human beings were able to create something as amazing as this and were able to breath life and personality into a computer program.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ghost houses and castle i think new music,some new enemies mostly castle one like bone goomba and pirahnna plant
<Dovah> Garettbrony: Drugs are Bad for you!!!
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's how SHE HAS A CONCERT
<Dken2021> Sketch_Toku_Brony dear lord so much coins
<Spectrum_Rush> i dont like my guess CrimsonPhoenix ._.
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: I would recommend doing some research into it.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ikr Dken2021 :D
<flutteryay> back :d
<Dken2021> though that concert thing was pretty neat, with the holograms and such
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, into what exactly
<flutteryay> i love chatting but if something dosnt stream soon im going to leave :/
<CrimsonPhoenix> I've seen enough with her
<Shizuka> 13waa
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: It's kind of hard to explain, really. It's best if you do research about her. But hey, to each his own.
<JESmith71> CrimsonPhoenix: Oh yeah that's right. The only new enemies I can think of are Dry versions of Goombas and Pirhana Plants. But unlike Dry Bones you can kill them with the Raccoon Tail
<flutteryay> brb
<HatsuneMikuFan> Shizuka: What was so funny at the end? I'm not getting it :/
<AJIsAwesome> I like Hatsune Miku, but I'm not a diehard fan.
<CrimsonPhoenix> how she was a computer program at first and how Japan manage to do some addicting lyrics that were good enough to post in niconico douga
*Spectrum_Rush reingages lurkmode
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Like I said, research it.
<Garettbrony> Dovah Tv Tropes isnt A drug http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic
<CrimsonPhoenix> then the picture for the voice and the voice itself got popular and she had animation videos
*AJIsAwesome diables lurkmode
<AJIsAwesome> *disables*
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, I did some before
<CrimsonPhoenix> I do not need to search more
<Dovah> Garettbrony: .... why did you link that!!?!?! now i have to wast hours of my life!!!
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: I can't really tell you anymore. I don't really know how to explain it, really.
<Garettbrony> your welcome
<shibaru> -sigh-
<Dovah> NO!
<Dovah> I must be Strong!!!
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, you act as if there's something I do not know
<lowfn> Dovah: Tara Strong? :$
<CrimsonPhoenix> and it sort of gets on my nerves a bit
<HatsuneMikuFan> CrimsonPhoenix: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaA2liN9LKM I think this is really stupid
<Dovah> Tara Strong is batman, No joke
<CrimsonPhoenix> HatsuneMikuFan, but it sells
<HatsuneMikuFan> I know
<CrimsonPhoenix> The programmers of Vocaloid must be billionaires by now
<HatsuneMikuFan> Sega
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: I guess people become attached to it, I don't know. Like,I said, I can't explain it.
<Dken2021> I think it was Yamaha
<flutteryay> 1 hour and no stream i will leave
<AJIsAwesome> *Like I said*

<Ponies47> I am so slow :/
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka feel like playing mvm ?
<VenHur> See ya then Scoot-Scootaloo.
<Dken2021> so what is that mountain thing?
<twilight_sprinkle> if nothing works, close and reopen page/brewser or use a diffferent browser
<cutenesskitteh> Backerooni. But still no stream... >_>
<Shizuka> 13don't know...
<Shizuka> 13feeling very bleh today..
<cutenesskitteh> Nah, just kidding with ya XD
<JESmith71> Looking at two streams at once this, and NTom playing Banjo-Tooie over at Hellfire Comms
<VenHur> God, this game is also freaking awesome...
<God> i know
<cutenesskitteh> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> oh look, its a brony
<Dken2021> huh, what happened to the shiny gold blades from the first game?
<shibaru> There was a time when I would get a lot of bladder infections. My mom had a friend who was a doctor. She would call this friend and ask him for some medicine. The bladder infections kept coming back until she finally TOOK ME TO a doctor.
<JESmith71> No it's Iron Will
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> tired perhaps ? yo should sleep if so
<Pudge> oh shit iron will
<shibaru> And how about that ear infection?
<JESmith71> He's not a monster, he's a minotaur!
<VenHur> So...wait, if the bronies are like that... *looks at my lower half* FAWK YEAH!
<God> twiligh_sprinkle , my faithful student!
<Dken2021> don't remember Iron Will beinga centaur
<Cades> sure
<cutenesskitteh> I need to get on someones head....
<Shizuka> 13not tired just.. bleh...
<Shizuka> 13can't enjoy anything..
<JESmith71> D'oh
<twilight_sprinkle> its nice how they wait for you to finish your fatality thing
<God> yeah
<cow334> Lol kratos be going against iron will
*cutenesskitteh jumps onto Dken2021's head randomly
<Kandarihu> JESmith71, trying to juggle this stream with PSO2. Meanest Client Order yet. Not only do I have to clear a mission with an S rank in 15 minutes, it's one that ends in a Collect Code, hunting down Rare Minerals at the last minute.
<JESmith71> Dken2021: Got my mythical creatures mixed up
*cachi01|phone noms muffin "whassup docs"
<God> so dken2021 how is life in the year 2021
<VenHur> Speaking of which, I have the PS3 version of MK9, Kratos inculded.
<Klumzeedragon> Refreshing my stream isnt working either. 6_9 Why you no work for me?
*Dken2021 tries and balance cutenesskitteh on head
*cutenesskitteh ish being balanced
<Ponies47> Ohai cachi01|phone nothing much
<Klumzeedragon> Do I need to sacrifice something?
<twilight_sprinkle> Klumzeedragon: try reopening page or browser. or try different browser
<Dken2021> God don't know, it's all wet
<Pudge> never fear, seapony lyra will save up
<Pudge> us*
<Klumzeedragon> Kaaaaay.
<God> why does that huge monster sound like a girl
<Kandarihu> And it DOES have to be at the last minute, because I gotta kill enough monsters to qualify for an S ranking. And the Collect Code tends to be time consuming.
<Spectrum_Rush> this pony scares me
*cutenesskitteh looks around suspiciously
<flutterchu> if you see a sighn that say's say no to crack and it remind's you to put your pant's back up..........you might be a redneck
<Spectrum_Rush> :P
<VenHur> Now if only Neverrealm Studios can ask Rare to make a Mortal Kombat VS Killer Instinct title...
<cachi01|phone> VenHur that would be awesome
<shibaru> I had a horrible ear infection that was so bad, I couldn't get up. I'd fall just going from my bed to the toilet. I was just laying in my bed, constantly crying, unable to hear for so long. My mom kept assuming she knew what was wrong. She just kept buying eardrops that weren't working. Finally she took me to the doctor after a while.
<Dken2021> that would totally be awesome
<Klumzeedragon> Hello everypony~ :) I am back and the stream now works. Thanks twilight_sprinkle.
<flutterchu> WOAH WHAT THE BUCK IZ DIS THING
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> uhmm everyone have some of those days, try doing something you always like :3
<Cypresswolf> what is that - horse + crab + scorpion?
<Dken2021> some kind of spider pony
<FlutterMEDIC> WB Klumzeedragon
<cachi01|phone> flutterchu bronystate
<God> one time i took one of those pshycology tests to see if i was crazy and it said i was
<Shizuka> 13there really isn't anything..
<twilight_sprinkle> i thought it was like horse+spider+snake+water
<flutterchu> cachi01|phone: no the boss
<shibaru> I needed a pill to go with the eardrops because there was water behind my eardrum .__.
<cachi01|phone> Oh lol
<Cypresswolf> does that rock thing behind it make it part turtle?
<Klumzeedragon> Cypresswolf: Chimera of sorts? :D
<lowfn_Sleeping> Nighty night everypony

<Pudge> seapony lyra is the true enemy kratos
<Dken2021> Lyra wants to talk to that spiderpony
<cutenesskitteh> Potato-pony.... Huh. That reminds me.
<cachi01|phone> Lyra plushie is best pencil holder
<NocturnalBlade> sea lyra look out...theres a big horse crap thing behind you!
<cachi01|phone> Or shoe
<VenHur> Now the only promblem with making a MK VS KI game is the story of the KI roster, and they're fatalities...
<flutterchu> poor lyra needs that bucket to do anything atleast she's happy O.u.O
<cachi01|phone> Or glove
<NocturnalBlade> *crab
<potato_pony> cutenesskitteh: of?
*cutenesskitteh eats some potato chips
<Klumzeedragon> cachi01|phone: And pencil sharpener.
<potato_pony> ...

<cutenesskitteh> potato_pony: O_o
<NocturnalBlade> QuinnThePegaSistta: awww its ok...we all do that so times lol
*cachi01|phone eats potato_pony
<shibaru> If my mom ever takes me to the doctor for this, I'll have completely lost my voice. ._____.
<QuinnThePegaSistta> lol
<Kandarihu> If there's one thing that video games in general suggest, it's not that size doesn't matter. Size DOES matter, but only so much as the giant monster is at a disadvantage.
<cutenesskitteh> Is that possible? o_o
<VenHur> cachi01|phone: Oh, that was a strange crossover game, but still enjoyable...too bad that game only has an T rating...
<flutterchu> every......body......leiks........applez......
<FlutterMEDIC> dah fucq
<twilight_sprinkle> tbh i dont get why giants are slow, i would think their muscles would be proportional to their size
<QuinnThePegaSistta> Stab the heart!!
<cachi01|phone> VenHur yeah ikr........ I wanted to see superman being decapitated lol
<Dken2021> VenHur looks like they're making it up with injustice: gods among us
<FlutterMEDIC> *in Sniper voice* Stab stab stab!
<VenHur> And to any australlians that is on Bronystate, i'm sorry that you didn't get the game, darn contenversials.

<cachi01|phone> U need to taste real mexican tacos! THIS ARE THE TACOS ALL TRUE WARRIORS STRIVE FOR!
<Garettbrony> hey pudge you on for movie night?
<VenHur> So, why not also called MK10 Mortal Kombat 2? Hell, they rebooted the story of the first three games.
<cutenesskitteh> FlutterMEDIC: I'm officially freaked out
<Pudge> Garettbrony: i'll be on around 10ish I work friday
<cachi01|phone> Venhur cause mindfuck
<Cypresswolf> I've never heard of anyone eating kittens, I have heard of similar unrelated horrible things to cuteness
<VenHur> cachi01|phone: TACOS! FOR EVERYPONY!
<Garettbrony> Pudge thats a crime against bronyianity
<FlutterMEDIC> *tacos start raining from the sky*
<cutenesskitteh> O_o I don't think I should be a kitten/cat anymore...

<Athgaar> see ya
<Dken2021> yup
<Garettbrony> BroHoof /)
<FlutterMEDIC> Poseiden
<VenHur> So the story of the series in a nutshell is: Kratos family died, Kratos bows to kill the gods, blah blah blah blah blah.
<twilight_sprinkle> this game seems a bit to teenager-oriented to me tbh
*cutenesskitteh has a random hammer in her paws
<Garettbrony> I guess cratos is having a poseiden adventure
<VenHur> *vows
<Dken2021> funfact: Posiden created horses
*BroHoof hugs FlutterMEDIC,cachi01|phone,cutenesskitteh,HatsuneMikuFan,Dken2021,twilight_sprinkle /) Garettbrony
*Dken2021 hugs BroHoof back

<Pudge> i wish they would have released this on 360 so i wouldnt have to buy a ps3
<Pudge> but oh well
<twilight_sprinkle> deep voices mean we're tough...
<flutterchu> THAT WOULD MAKE A GOOD tumblr
<Dark92Enigma> Ok, Buytoast i don't know what you guys are arguing about......i hope i never find out why
<flutterchu> call upon the chees ponies
<VenHur> I has to wonder though, if Kratos killed all of the gods in the world, won't he be the only God that lived? Won't he just realised it by now and commit an suicide attempt?
<twilight_sprinkle> this game should have a teen-meter and teen points
<DJ_POn-3> BroHoof: i am still trying to learn to type in russian i keep typing in traditional english QWERTY which i dislike how i do this
<flutterchu> zecora warn's the main 6 will have a cheese addiction

<Spectrum_Rush> Buytoast: they're just regular gorgans
<flutterchu> bye HatsuneMikuFan
<VenHur> Buytoast: Unless this is an servant of Medusa.
<Caramel> Medusa is ONE gorgon
<Buytoast> well i know medusa was gorgon, but i didn't know they all looked like that
<Bronami> Good. I was just playing The Small Horse. It is a scary amnesia custom story with ponies.
<flutterchu> ill be right back i half to read the scedule
<Dken2021> Gorgons looks more snake-like, and shiny
<Buytoast> i figured they were some sort of ox like creature
<Pudge> oh my bad
<Buytoast> and that medusa was just a high ranking one
<twilight_sprinkle> Dken2021: what about Gordons?
<Pudge> where was gordon when ____?

<Pudge> gondor*
<twilight_sprinkle> i was thinking more of hl, but thats fine too

<AJIsAwesome> Ok.
<Bronami> Hey, in your epert brony opinions, where, other than the internet, is the most common place for brony presence?
<twilight_sprinkle> :(
<flutterchu> let the bodies hit the florr

<AJIsAwesome> Bronami: Conventions and Meetups, IMO.
<twilight_sprinkle> where does he keep the bow and the sword anyway?
<cachi01|phone> hi Reikim!
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Hi! :)
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Reikim
<flutterchu> cachi01|phone: that song's pretty annoying
<Bronami> I have no meetups in my area. Thats why I asked
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Where Sonic keeps his Chaos Emeralds.
<thelonepony> hi Reikim
<Reikim> Today I have realized something.
<Reikim> There is a point where you go past being tired.
<Cynder7> 6>.<
<flutterchu> too bad twilight crobat doesnt like me http://mlp-vectorclub.deviantart.com/gallery/?set=29968919&offset=432#/d4lbql5
<cachi01|phone> flutterchu its overused.but good imo :)
<Reikim> You become so tired that being tired becomes a non-issue and suddenly everything is clear again.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Inky Pie / Apple Bloom Learns The Family Business / Surprise Visit
<flutterchu> prince-dari: oh boy
<flutterchu> inkie was alot better in ask the crusaders
<AJIsAwesome> Did you guys know that Pinkie's sisters and father are based off Inky, Blinky, and Clyde from the Pacman games?
<Reikim> Yup
<flutterchu> AJIsAwesome: OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH
<Reikim> Inky, Blinky, Pinkie and Clyde.
<Reikim> And then Sue, the mother.
<Buytoast> yet more fanon bullshit i presume
<VenHur> AJIsAwesome: If you mean by name and not apperance, then yeah.
<Reikim> I also learned
<Reikim> I become strangely chatty when tired to this point.
<flutterchu> DID YOU know that pipsqueak appears in the backround of putting your hood down
<OohShiny> sup everypony
<NocturnalBlade> hi OohShiny
<ScottishUnicorn> yeep
<AJIsAwesome> flutterchu: Actually, I did. They did a freeze frame of it.
<cachi01|phone> hi OohShiny!
<OohShiny> I see we're watching GoW 3
<sub06905> hood lol
<AJIsAwesome> OohShiny: Hello! :)
<flutterchu> ooooooooohhhhhhhh shhhiiiiiinnnnyyyyyy OuO
<OohShiny> the soundtrack didn't even change huh?
<OohShiny> who's playing?
<NocturnalBlade> Caramel:
<OohShiny> interesting, never saw him on chat
<flutterchu> OohShiny: some game on the gaystation
<Caramel> OohShiny: then you aren't paying attention
<Buytoast> bpy, this movie sure is engrossing
<Caramel> and Flutterchu: if you're a fanboy, keep it to yourself
<flutterchu> PARKUAH
<OohShiny> Caramel: Not actually, I enter the chat just once a week
<Klumzeedragon> flutterchu seems hyper today/
<flutterchu> Klumzeedragon: ..........T~T
<OohShiny> okay, this soundtrack is good
<cachi01|phone> G2G to sleep. Goodnight everypony :)
<Reikim> Caramel: You bastard. I've got Gunleon's theme permanently etched into my brain now. I hope you're happy.
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: Night! :)
<NocturnalBlade> nite cachi01|phone
<flutterchu> Klumzeedragon: oh wait never mind youre wright i drank 6 CAN'S OF COKE AND BACON for edd
<Klumzeedragon> OohShiny: I can't really hear it. I'm play Coal Chamber through my speakers and playing Darksiders 2 while watching Caramel play. :P Multitasking!

<BroHoof> night DJ_POn-3
<Klumzeedragon> DJ_POn-3: Nighty night~. :)
<OohShiny> night DJ_POn-3
<flutterchu> im sure it will stop when a thunderstorm comes
<Klumzeedragon> flutterchu: See. I knew it. :P
<OohShiny> I see zombies... In the underworld?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Married Again
<Klumzeedragon> OohShiny: It makes sense damn it!
<OohShiny> no it doesn't
<Reikim> Don't look so surprised.
<OohShiny> zombies are physical
<OohShiny> in the underworld there is mostly souls
<Reikim> Everyone knows the underworld is full of zombies for the express purpose of messing with you.
<Reikim> Also: someone hasn't read the Inferno.
<OohShiny> Reikim: But there are other monsters in the underworld
<OohShiny> like ghouls
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> and ghosts? lol GnG
<Reikim> Well
<Reikim> Depends on which Underworld you're talking about.
<OohShiny> I'm talking about Hades
<Reikim> The Greek one?
<OohShiny> yes
<Reikim> Which area are we in?
<OohShiny> Hades
*Reikim note: cannot see stream
<Reikim> Hades was split in three.
<OohShiny> yes
<Reikim> Which area are we in?
<OohShiny> Elisiukm
<OohShiny> oh
<OohShiny> we are in tartarus
<OohShiny> I think
<Reikim> I thought this was GoW? Or so the chat said.
<OohShiny> or the gates of erebos
<NocturnalBlade> this is GoW...3
<twilight_sprinkle> ohey its iron will
<Buytoast> Gates of Elysium or some shit
<OohShiny> Reikim: Yes, it's GoW
<Reikim> Either way, you're probably looking at a Christian version of Hades mixed with heapings of artistic license.
<OohShiny> Reikim, no I'm not
<OohShiny> Hades do not have zombies
<Reikim> Okay, then hell I don't know
<OohShiny> they have skeletons
<Reikim> I blame artistic license.
<Reikim> Or just plain Not Caring.
<Reikim> Actually, let's go with that last one.
<Reikim> Hardly anyone tries to get an actual, accurate portrayal of Hell anymore.
<OohShiny> the 3 judges, nice
<OohShiny> king minos is one son of a bitch
<Reikim> Addendum: I thought GoW was concerned with mutants from below the planet's crust. When did they fall into Hell?
<twilight_sprinkle> beyond that door, waits your NEEEEEW CAAAAAR
<shibaru> I have an epic nosdrip from crying lol
<Cypresswolf> OMG A Gian Rock!
<OohShiny> why is king minos one of the judges anyway? he was a pussy in the greek mythology
<VenHur> Pfft, that's just a roc-OH MY GOD, ANOTHER GIANT ROCK!
<OohShiny> and I know he was one of the judges too
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> twilight_sprinkle lol the three judges Bob Barker,Drew Carey and Pat Sayjack :D
<Reikim> Because, like I said, they probably mixed up everything.
<OohShiny> Reikim: King Minos is actually one of the judges
<Reikim> There's probably more of the Inferno in here than actual Grecian mythology.
<Reikim> Ah
<Reikim> You're wondering why, in Greek mythology, he became a judge?
<twilight_sprinkle> thats a lotta iron will clones
<OohShiny> yes
<Reikim> Supposedly after his many misadventures he actually figured out how to be a decent kind of guy and reigned rather nicely for a while.
<NocturnalBlade> love it how the other one just sits there and lets you kill his friend lol
<Cades> haha
<Reikim> He was just enough that the Gods decided to reward him by making him a judge of the damned.
<OohShiny> Reikim: And died by the hands of Daedalus' vengeance
<Reikim> Maybe it's just me, but that seems like a real shitty reward...
<AJIsAwesome> I'm guessing these monsters can only be killed by takedowns, right?
<magmablock> How far into the game is this?
<Reikim> I don't remember how Minos died, how did it happen again?
<OohShiny> magmablock: a bit after kratos kills poseidon and falls straight into hell
<flutterchu> magmablock: this is how to play :D
<magmablock> aight, so fairly early
<OohShiny> Reikim: Daedalus used some kind of herb that absorbed the king
<Reikim> ...What?
<OohShiny> like, he put plant seed in the king's bath, they growed and entangled him
<OohShiny> then absorbed him
<Reikim> Nine bits says he got it from some god.
<OohShiny> and the chat died
<Buytoast> sounds like some kinky ass shit
<AJIsAwesome> Nope.
<flutterchu> woah Phase4 i didnt know you were online you usually talk much
<AJIsAwesome> Still alive.
<scout19_tf2> immmm back wus up everypony
<AJIsAwesome> scout19_tf2: Welcome back. :)
<BroHoof> sup scout19_tf2
<thelonepony> hi scout19_tf2
<Reikim> OohShiny: Who were the other three judges?
<OohShiny> Reikim: I don't remember
<OohShiny> just remember minos
<Phase4> flutterchu, yeah, i've been less active due to my inability to recive stream
<scout19_tf2> so wut happend while i was gone
<Cades> imma be gone for a bit, peace
<Buytoast> ha, was that a letter from that salty old bastard from the first game?
<BroHoof> why do i have an urge to play God of War
<OohShiny> BroHoof: because it's awesome
<BroHoof> OohShiny: true
*Ponies47 Tip hoofs back into chat in his PJ's
<OohShiny> dis part of the soundtrack
<thelonepony> wb Ponies47 :)
<Reikim> Eh, I never really did the GoW thing.
<Reikim> I do remember when it came out, though.
<Ponies47> thelonepony: I shoudl be in bed :$
<Ponies47> *should
<OohShiny> Reikim: If I remember correctly, the first one was 2004 right?
<Reikim> I pretty much dismissed it as violence for the sake of violence. Granted, I was pretty damn biased back then.
<Reikim> Hell if I know, I just remember seeing it in a store and walking right by.
<Reikim> The game literally had no interest for me. I still don't know why.
<OohShiny> well, I played all of them, except 3
<OohShiny> even the PSP ones
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: yeah but it is violence for violences sakr
<Reikim> There were PSP ones?
<scout19_tf2> wut game is this
<OohShiny> yes
<Reikim> The hell
<Ponies47|Shower> Brb shower
<OohShiny> Chain of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta
<NocturnalBlade> God of War scout19_tf2
<magmablock> scout19_tf2: God of War 3
<Reikim> ...
<OohShiny> the latter being my favorite of the series
<Reikim> .................
<Reikim> Well.
<scout19_tf2> oh cool
<Reikim> Well fuck.
<Reikim> Huh
<Reikim> I thought GoW meant GEARS of War.
<Reikim> ...
<OohShiny> oh no
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<magmablock> both
<OohShiny> it's God of War
*Reikim laughs hysterically
<Reikim> Oh god I'm too tired to be awake still.
<Reikim> Anyway, GoW DID hold interest for me.
<Reikim> I just never got around to playing it.
<OohShiny> are you talking about Gears or God?
<Reikim> God
<twilight_sprinkle> god of war is too teenagy for me, and too much pointless violence, and the main hero is a douche
<Reikim> You know what fuck acronyms
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Same here. I NEVER found the interest in the game.
<magmablock> In my opinion, Kratos is the villain in all this
<Reikim> God of War is kind of outside my field, really.
<twilight_sprinkle> magmablock: he is
<Reikim> Not my thing.
<OohShiny> In my opinion, there is no hero in Greek Mythology
<Reikim> Never really paid much attention to it.
<AJIsAwesome> I would consider him an anti-hero, IMO.
<BroHoof> how about darksiders anyone like that game
<Reikim> Greek definition of a hero?
<Pudge> back
<NocturnalBlade> BroHoof: i did
<OohShiny> Reikim: Someone that did great deed for humanity
<oni_link> Anyone know of anything that helps get rid of headaches? I have a really bad one and I took two Advil but it didnt help
<Reikim> Because in Greek Mythology there are plenty of heros. They're all just assholes/stupid/incompetent.
<OohShiny> totally
<BroHoof> NocturnalBlade: it's a pretty good game it has a good character and a good story too
<OohShiny> that's why I said there's no hero
<Reikim> Thus the concept of Tragic Hero, which I am sick to my teeth of.
<magmablock> oni_link: Tylenol, maybe?
<JESmith71> oni_link: Don't know what to tell you. I usually just take a pill and lie down and that's enough for me
<NocturnalBlade> BroHoof: yea...and it has Mark Hamel lol
<BerryPunch> Title on www.bronystate.net: Brony Fan Fair Podcast Schedule (or PS, BFF) | BronyState
<OohShiny> Achilles took an arrow to the knee or something
<Reikim> It's called a Tragic Hero, OohShiny, it's very common, the Greeks invented it, and I have spent way too much of my past time becoming familiar with it.
<oni_link> magmablock: I dont have any unfortunately.
<Reikim> YAY
<Reikim> BS POST
<BroHoof> NocturnalBlade: yea xP
<oni_link> JESmith71: maybe i should just lie down for a bit. I have to study later on for my learners permit though,
<thelonepony> oni_link just sleep it off
<twilight_sprinkle> god of agent smiths
<OohShiny> Hephaestus
<scout19_tf2> oh noo its a giant man
<Reikim> I am quite literally sick to my teeth of the tragic hero.
<OohShiny> nice
<OohShiny> badass voice
<oni_link> yeah i think thats what I need to do thelonepony
<Shizuka> 13you have to study for a learners permit, seriously?
<AJIsAwesome|Shower> Brb guys, I need a shower.
<Reikim> Shizuka: Up here you do.
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: ikr!
<oni_link> Shizuka: Tests of all kinds make me nervous.
<Reikim> The test is absolutely retardedly easy.
<Pudge> Shizuka: you do have to take a test you know
<Pudge> but its easy
<OohShiny> Zeus threw Hephaestus out of olympus, Zeus is a douche
<Reikim> It actually takes effort to fail the test for a G1 in Ontario.
<Reikim> OohShiny: We know. It would be easier to list the number of things that Zeus has done that do not qualify him for douchehood. I'm a fan of doing nothing.
<Reikim> In a lot of ways, Zeus is actually more of a jackass than his father was.
<OohShiny> yeah
<OohShiny> Hades is actually a good guy
<Reikim> For one thing, I'm pretty sure Chronus didn't have sex with everything under the sun (and then some)
<twilight_sprinkle> oh man look at that action
<Reikim> Hades isn't a good guy.
<OohShiny> not definitly 'good'
<Reikim> He's just not his brothers.
<twilight_sprinkle> walking slowly i ncircles
<twilight_sprinkle> i cant take this action
<OohShiny> but he was betrayed by his brothers
<Reikim> Hades is notable because he doesn't actually do anything.
<Reikim> He looks good next to his brothers.
<magmablock> Hades strikes me as the kind of guy who's just doing his job. He is a bit of a callous motherfucker, though
<oni_link> Well either way, Im gonna take your advice and take a nap so I can try and shake off this headache. Ill see you all later :P
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03twilight_sprinkle: Too MLG for you?
<OohShiny> Hades just takes care of the souls
<Reikim> Pretty much, yeah.
<twilight_sprinkle> Scoot-Scootaloo: absolutely
<Reikim> He's also, in theory, the most powerful of the three.
<NocturnalBlade> bye oni_link
<OohShiny> Reikim: and he don't even complain
<Reikim> Damn straight.
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle :3
<Reikim> Hades is a chill kind of guy.

<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: im ok, minus Federer losing yesterday :( what about you?
<OohShiny> Reikim: And that's why I say Hades is a good guy.
<Reikim> Hades is a damn chill guy and is my first choice of Greek god to hang with.
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle D: im good, just started class today >.< and uh... whats on the stream?
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: god of war 3
<NocturnalBlade> Panda|Drawing: God Of War 3
<Reikim> Every other deity in the Greek pantheon is basically an asshole. EXCEPT maybe Prometheus, but he's a Titan.
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle D: who is streaming?
<OohShiny> Reikim: He's not part of the pantheon too
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: caramel
<Reikim> This is why I said.
<Reikim> Titan.
<Reikim> I don't think any other Greek god manages to be nice.
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle should have known ^^ im not watchign the stream currently >.>

<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle D: drawing :3

<Reikim> This chat is not a body of water and therefore there are no prawns.
<Reikim> Period.
<OohShiny> I would love to see Fluttershy's reaction on God of War 3
<Reikim> Space.
<Reikim> Ever.
<Reikim> Period.
<twilight_sprinkle> okaaaay?

<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: only cause low def stream
<Reikim> There are no miniature crustacean things in this chat.
<superretroworld> oh
<Reikim> I would know because if there were I would cook them, barbecue them, and eat them.
<OohShiny> Badass Boss Incoming... probably
<Reikim> Who's he going to fight?
<OohShiny> Hades
<Reikim> I assume he already tore Cerberus a new one oh
<NocturnalBlade> Reikim: Hades...i think
<Reikim> Wait
<Reikim> We've said Hades is a good guy.
<OohShiny> I know that
<Reikim> What about that fiasco involving Demetre?
<Reikim> And her daughter?
<OohShiny> but Kratos is the bad guy
<NocturnalBlade> and Kratos cares about that why
<OohShiny> Hades voice is awesome
<Reikim> I'm bringing something up into a conversation that ended several minutes ago.
<magmablock> Fun fact: Hades is voiced by Clancy Brown, aka Mr. Krabbs
<Reikim> Hades did, once, fuck up everything.
<OohShiny> magmablock HOLY FUCK!
<twilight_sprinkle> magmablock: Lol
<magmablock> And Lex Luthor
<scout19_tf2> they always say u wont get away but u always do
<NocturnalBlade> magmablock: i thought he sounded familiar
<twilight_sprinkle> cannot unhear
<OohShiny> Reikim: the Kraken?
<XylemTube> God of War?
<Reikim> OohShiny: What's her name...starts with a P. Demeter's daughter.
<NocturnalBlade> XylemTube: eeyup
<XylemTube> Cool!
<Ponies47> Back from mah shower
<Reikim> Kidnapped her, then tricked her into eating Underworld fruit, then she was bound there.
<magmablock> Hopping between Harpes like a boss
<NocturnalBlade> wb Ponies47
<OohShiny> Reikim: There is also the Andromeda fiasco
<Reikim> Demeter was so upset she stopped caring about the world and winter happened.
<sub06905> wb Ponies47
<Reikim> Was Andromeda Hades?
<OohShiny> no
<Ponies47> Thanks NocturnalBlade and sub06905
<Reikim> I thought Andromeda was Neptune?
<Reikim> Um
<Reikim> Damn, roman name
<Reikim> Poseidon
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Persephone
<Reikim> Yes!
<Reikim> Persephone.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Per See Phon Eee
<OohShiny> Hades didn't fucked up that
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Thats how you say it
<Reikim> Yeah he did.
<Reikim> He kidnapped her.
<OohShiny> Persephone just ate the fruit
<Reikim> He kidnapped her first.
<Reikim> Then he tricked her into eating it.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03She was kidnapped from her mother Ceres
<Reikim> By, you know, not warning her in advance.
<Reikim> Demeter.
<Reikim> Greek names, Scoots.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03:|
<Reikim> Dammit I gotta type slower.
<Ponies47> Oh dear. I just realized both of my cats are in my room O_O
<sub06905> kitteh spies :3
<twilight_sprinkle> Ponies47: holy shiz man, run!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Anyways, she swallowed 6 seeds and so Demeter made a deal with Hades
<Reikim> So anyway, Shiny, Hades kidnapped Persephone, she gets trapped there, Demeter freezes over the world.
<Reikim> And then deal.
<Reikim> Which Scoots will outline.
<OohShiny> Reikim: not actually, hades gave persephone on spring
*Scoot-Scootaloo hugs Reikm
<Ponies47> One of them is growling at the other ;~;
<Reikim> OohShiny: Scoots will explain.
<twilight_sprinkle> aaand boss
<twilight_sprinkle> kratosbob swordpants, yer late fer werk!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Persephone would be allowed to stay with her mom for six months and return to the underworld for the rest
<superretroworld> welcome back my friends to the chat that never ends, were so glad you could attend, come inside come inside. be ready when you can theres the bronies that love and tolerance, so come and join the herd, comin join comin join
<Reikim> Thus the seasons were born.
<Ponies47> INB4 Cat fight (literally)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03During that time, Demeter says screw you world and freezes it
<Reikim> Woman really loves her daughter.
<OohShiny> Demeter could be a good goddess
<Reikim> Kind of funny, because most parents can't wait to be rid of their children ASAP.
<superretroworld> OohShiny: isnt she already a goddess?
<Reikim> Anyway: UND THAN THE SEASONS WERE BORN.
<OohShiny> emphasis on good
<Reikim> Demeter's in the same boat as Hades in that she really isn't a jackass but doesn't do anything spectacular either.
<OohShiny> superretroworld I meant she could be good, she's already a goddes
<Reikim> She does throw a hissyfit for half the year, though.
<OohShiny> that's her rage
<Reikim> Hissyfit.
<superretroworld> oh
<scout19_tf2> cya everypony i gotta go got school tommorow c u all at movie night
<twilight_sprinkle> bye scout19_tf2
<OohShiny> nice, what's a Hissyfit? not an english speaker
<superretroworld> bye scout19_tf2
<Ponies47> Nighty night scout19_tf2 :)
<Reikim> You know when you get a kid and they're being really whiny?
<Reikim> Being all cranky and stomping around and snapping at everyone?
<Reikim> Hissyfit.
<OohShiny> I would have a headache
<OohShiny> but thanks for the explanation
<OohShiny> I learned a new world today
<OohShiny> word
<OohShiny> new word*
<Reikim> So Demeter's not really a jackass so much as she is the epitome of every over-protective mother everywhere.
<superretroworld> im turning 17 ans i still have trouble with definitions and new words
<flutterchu> dinner was great/hello everypony
<NocturnalBlade> hi flutterchu
<superretroworld> hello flutterchu
<thelonepony> hi flutterchu
<OohShiny> Interesting that in games, a boss tells you to come in, obviosly waiting for you, but instead you have to go through a lot of crazy shit to fight him for real
<Kandarihu> Ah, puzzles
<VenHur> As Duke Nukem once said... "I hate valve puzzles."
<OohShiny> I remember the infinite red orb glitch
<OohShiny> in the first game
<superretroworld> VenHur: so in general, he hates the game portal? your kidding me
<magmablock> Good times
<OohShiny> such good times not long ago
<magmablock> maxing out Artemis and the blades and fucking up everything
<magmablock> till you get to Ares
<magmablock> real pain in the ass
<OohShiny> Ares is fucked up in god mode
<OohShiny> immortal bitch
<Ponies47> Moo ^.^
<Kandarihu> superretroworld, it makes sense that Duke Nukem doesn't like playing an FPS where the only gun you get shoots mostly harmless portals.
<NocturnalBlade> moo
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sooo trine is in discount how about that ?
<Reikim> Meh
<Reikim> Don't even know anything about that one.
<OohShiny> finally, the boss
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim beutiful art and soundtrack it's worth it
<Reikim> Lovely
<Reikim> How much?
<superretroworld> Kandarihu: well its technically not a fps since you dont have a gun, just a porta gun
<Reikim> Even though I'm not going to buy it.
<flutterchu> PLAESE tell me this is the final boss
<OohShiny> no
<magmablock> Not even close
<OohShiny> just hades
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Trine Complete Collection 9 bucks

<NocturnalBlade> fight dat god
<VenHur> HEEEEERE'S HADEY!
<Reikim> I can't
<twilight_sprinkle> he eats a lotta souls at MCsoulands
*Stallion_of_War did what had to be done
<Reikim> Meh
<OohShiny> Immortal gods are killable, therefore, Kratos is Shikamaru
<Reikim> I can't
<Reikim> Can't afford time
<Stallion_of_War> Ahh, the day I killed Hades. Yes, I remember it well.
*Sketch_Toku_Brony imagines Fluttershy fighting Hades in Tartarus like this :D
<twilight_sprinkle> OohShiny: what?
<Stallion_of_War> Fun fact: Hades has a Lyra plushie in his room.
<magmablock> Coolest attack ever
<Stallion_of_War> Well, had, technically
<Ponies47> I knew it! My cats are fighting! D:
<JRP> god of war
<OohShiny> twilight_sprinkle: Shikamaru killed an immortal called Hidan
<Ponies47> Agian! D:
<twilight_sprinkle> OohShiny: hidan wasnt a god though
<OohShiny> twilight_sprinkle: he was immortal anyway
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> a game you may like is called analogue a hate story
<Stallion_of_War> JRP: Me of War
<twilight_sprinkle> OohShiny: and hes actually more immortal than hades
<OohShiny> twilight_sprinkle: and was a fucking sadomasochist
<Reikim> What?
<twilight_sprinkle> OohShiny: yeah he was an interesting character
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> analogue: a hate story i think you may like that game
<JRP> Caramel: dat interlacing
<Stallion_of_War> And the said Haphestus was ugly...
<OohShiny> Hades is not ugly, he's badass
<flutterchu> i have to go now bye
<Ponies47> My cat is growling like a dog O.O
<Ponies47> Bye flutterchu
<Stallion_of_War> DO NOT QUESTION YOUR STALLION OF WAR
<thelonepony> by flutterchy
<Pudge> wheres the mare of war?
<thelonepony> soul cerberous
<Reikim> What is it?
<DerpyMuffins> Well Bye everypony
<Kandarihu> Ponies47, is he looking out the window?
<OohShiny> Pudge: Some Earth Pony trying to kill Celestia?
<Pudge> bye DerpyMuffins
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> cya DerpyMuffins
<NocturnalBlade> bye DerpyMuffins
<Stallion_of_War> Princess Luna is in the royal bedcham... :$
<thelonepony> bye DerpyMuffins
<Reikim> I WILL QUESTION WHOEVER THE HELL I LIKE I don't even know what's going on
<Pudge> OohShiny: sounds like fanfiction material
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> TUG of WAR 3
<Stallion_of_War> Flutteros V Solar Flare
<OohShiny> Pudge: There you have an Idea for a fanfic, I'm not good at writing
<Ponies47> Kandarihu: The one growling is a she. They are fighting agian. And the other she is growling is my other cat and he is only a kitten :S
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Cathy Weseluck and Recording of Andrew Francis Interviews
<Stallion_of_War> Since Celestia has to be Zeus, Solar Flare is Helios
<Pudge> OohShiny: my english teachers tell me I'm a really good writer
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ehhh the easiest way to put it would be that is like a visual novel or date simulator
<NocturnalBlade> oooo...new weapons!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> but the story is quite good
<OohShiny> wow
<Stallion_of_War> Ladies and Gentalman, the TUG OF WAR!
<OohShiny> bad ass weapon
<XisBestChemical> RIP Headphone users, and hi everypony!
<Kandarihu> Kratos: "Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself!"
<OohShiny> wee, kratos is back
<OohShiny> I mean hades
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol dat Hooker Trophy
<OohShiny> and he looks beautiful
<VenHur> Hi XisBestChemical.
<Stallion_of_War> The one attack for Hades' hooks looks like some sort of dance move
<magmablock> Acheivement Get: Do something that you have to do in order to beat the game and is therefor a completely uninteresting accomplishment!
<NocturnalBlade> hi XisBestChemical
<Stallion_of_War> the large-area attack
<Pudge> well i'
<OohShiny> Fuck you Hades, you are not in hell
<Stallion_of_War> magmablock: There are actually achievements for turning the game on you know.
<OohShiny> you're in Hades
<Pudge> I gotta go ponies, got work tomorrow. night all
<NocturnalBlade> nite Pudge
<magmablock> wow
<Stallion_of_War> magmablock: Not this one, but some
<thelonepony> night Pudge
<Kandarihu> magmablock, not all achievements are meant to be entertaining. Achievements like that are a milestone to let others know how far one has gotten in the main game.
<JESmith71> magmablock: At least with 360 games it's an easy point boost
<OohShiny> oh, that's how he kills hades
<NocturnalBlade> YOUR SOUL....IS MINE!
<sub06905> after 3 hrs of soft reseting Heartgold i finally got a Shiny starter :$
<Stallion_of_War> Hades was delicious
<Stallion_of_War> Tasted like Chicken
<OohShiny> his head will explode!
<OohShiny> RUN TO THE HILLS!
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905 O_o is that a glitch?
<sub06905> twilight_sprinkle: nope
<thelonepony> souls be free!!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> >soft resetting
<Prince_Blueblood> the hills have eyes
<Prince_Blueblood> don't run there
<Stallion_of_War> His helmate is down in the water to the left
<Stallion_of_War> Caramel
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905: how does it work?
<Prince_Blueblood> *helmet
<Stallion_of_War> I AM THE STALLION OF WAR, NOT OF SPELLING
<OohShiny> the sisters of fate were no the sisters of fate, because if kratos killed them, time would simply stop, and world would be doomed
<LadyCanary> :O
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai LadyCanary
<Reikim> NOBODY IS EXEMPT FROM SPELLING
<LadyCanary> HEY! God of War! Good choice, Caramel!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Go to sleep, LadyCanary!
<Reikim> NOT EVEN EQUINES OF BATTLE
<LadyCanary> D: NO SCOOTS.

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I don't supposeyou have extra itmes lying around for TF2... do you?
<Stallion_of_War> There really does need to be a remake of this with Fluttershy as Kratos
<SuperBrony64> 11,02oops, wrong channel
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: Maybe you should sleep.......
<twilight_sprinkle> SuperBrony64: O_O

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Haaaaaaaaiiiii LadyAthena :3
<Reikim> The REST of me is tired but my mind is currently floating upon a sea of clouds made of coton candy in space.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Scoot-Scootaloo depends of what item :p

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Scoot-Scootaloo what are you looking for ?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Scoot-Scootaloo: You getting on so I can give you stuff? :3

<thelonepony> i'm not sleeping yet
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905: so wait do you restart the game, then press the buttons, then restart the game?
<Stallion_of_War> LadyAthena: I'm keeping hope btw... you can't have it, so :P
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Actually I have to go to bed now, no time for Steam :/
<Stallion_of_War> He wasn't always a monster, he used to be ugly!

<LadyAthena> Night Scoots :3
<OohShiny> oh, kryptonite
<sub06905> twilight_sprinkle: you press the buttons when they arnt shiny, so it will take you back to the start screen, then choose your file and see if any of the starters are shiny
<Stallion_of_War> Basically :D
<OohShiny> Kratos' kryptonite is his daughter
<VenHur> Well, he's an anti-hero. Love or Tolerance.
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Yep.
<sub06905> twilight_sprinkle: and repeat that process until a shiny appears
<Stallion_of_War> OohShiny: It certianly isn't death, fate, betrayal by the gods...
<Spectrum_Rush> the probability of getting a shiny pokemon is 1/8192
<Stallion_of_War> etc.
<AJIsAwesome> He does things only for himself and doesn't care about anyone else.
<SpeedyBolt> Poor doggies :<
<AJIsAwesome> Spectrum_Rush: Until Black 2 White 2. :D
<Stallion_of_War> Geordi Theforge?

<sub06905> twilight_sprinkle: np
<twilight_sprinkle> Spectrum_Rush: "im different"
<AJIsAwesome> Spectrum_Rush: There's a key item you can get that will increase the chances of shiny pokemono.
<Stallion_of_War> Brotip: If it moves, kill it.
<AJIsAwesome> *pokemon*

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Stallion_of_War: Protip for Pokemon.

<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: :D
<SpeedyBolt> Wait, a key item that gets you shinies easier?
<SpeedyBolt> That sounds awesome
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ikr?
<OohShiny> this game is fucking big
<twilight_sprinkle> its the portal to outland!
<Ryunosuke> ...
<Stallion_of_War> This makes me want to draw Fluttershy holding the cevered head of a NMM-Styled Celestia
<Stallion_of_War> *severed
<Ryunosuke> shineys are special BECAUSE THEY ARE RARE
<OohShiny> Caramel: Will you fuck Aphrodite when you get to her minigame?
<Stallion_of_War> or w/e
<AJIsAwesome> It's the portal to Equestria! :O
<Ryunosuke> fucking kids
<Spectrum_Rush> AJIsAwesome: you sure im looking at info on shiny pokes and theres no mention of an item like that in B2W2

<OohShiny> break her bone
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> have a nice trip *puts on shades* see you next fall...YEEEAAAAHHH!! :D
<SpeedyBolt> lol
<VenHur> Damn Kratos, just...damn.
<Reikim> So God of War can be summed up as follows: Kratos kills shit because he feels like it?
<SpeedyBolt> I actually kinda laughed when she fell
<NocturnalBlade> -_(\
<Reikim> Slightly disappointing.
<Petrified_Discord> Handy Man
<twilight_sprinkle> he gave her a hand
<OohShiny> Reikim: He killed Gaia because she let him die
<Ryunosuke> kratos to Gaia: you can *puts on shades* leaf it to me YEEAAAH
<OohShiny> Reikim: Obviously, he came back from the dead
<Reikim> Oh like he needs an excuse to kill her.
<Petrified_Discord> Kratos kills Gaia because his personality is "kill things for no reason and be angry all the time."
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<NocturnalBlade> that seems right
<SpeedyBolt> GRR
<SpeedyBolt> IM ANGRY AND I KILL THINGS
<twilight_sprinkle> hes basicallly a teenager
<SpeedyBolt> lol
<OohShiny> Kratos logic has some sense, he wants to kill everything (including humans) that is fucking up the world
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Yep.
<Ryunosuke> kratos is the angry atheist :)
<Petrified_Discord> twilight_sprinkle: "You don't understand me, Dad!"
<JRP> SuperBrony64:
<OohShiny> he even kills himself
<SpeedyBolt> That...kinda sounds like me, twilight_sprinkle
<Maid_RainBow> OMG i just saw this Baby Spike Comercial on the TV
<OohShiny> because he fucked up the world
<twilight_sprinkle> SpeedyBolt: :I
<VenHur> In a more fancy God of War-ish way: "I kill the mortals, they don't stand in my way!"
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> they cant speak normal
<SpeedyBolt> Not the doggies :<
<twilight_sprinkle> they have to use fanceh words
<spartan133t> hia guys
<spartan133t> god of war?
<OohShiny> now that I think about it, Gaia is all earthy, she can be Fluttershy!
<magmablock> yup
<NocturnalBlade> hi spartan133t and yea
<twilight_sprinkle> hi spartan133t and yes, your name is fitting
<AJIsAwesome> spartan133t: Yep. and hello! :)
<spartan133t> lol
<SpeedyBolt> But if Gaia is Fluttershy
<SpeedyBolt> Then Kratos just...
<spartan133t> its my xbl name also
<VenHur> ...Rainbow Dash?
<OohShiny> Gaia is not dead yet
<twilight_sprinkle> so he killed fluttershy? well,i want to say okay with that, but not even fluttershy deserves it
<spartan133t> VenHur: no spartan133t
<magmablock> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/360/0/f/ghost_of_equestria_by_raikoh14-d4kasxw.jpg
<SpeedyBolt> Fluttershy deserves to live, she never did anything wrong
<twilight_sprinkle> fluttershy is most evil pony
<SpeedyBolt> ...Minus those two episodes.
<Petrified_Discord> VenHur: http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/26352321.jpg
<OohShiny> y u hate fluttershy?
<twilight_sprinkle> cause fluttershy is evil
<SpeedyBolt> SCREEE
<OohShiny> she most certainly isn't, sir
<SpeedyBolt> Fluttershy just has a wild demon in her.
<twilight_sprinkle> >.element of harmony and animal keeper
<twilight_sprinkle> >uses fear and intimidation of the stare to control animals
<SpeedyBolt> Dont we all?
<Maid_RainBow> i just saw the My little pony talking baby Spike commercial aahhh that thing is scary
<JRP> SuperBrony64: talk now
<SpeedyBolt> Everypony just about breaks their element...except Twilight.
<SpeedyBolt> Not sure how you can break magic.
<AJIsAwesome> Maid_RainBow: Wait, what?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man that Sweetie Bell Kratos is epic yet creepy
<magmablock> Did I just hear a riff from the Game of Thrones theme?
<SpeedyBolt> ...and Applejack, who tells the truth, but screws it.
<OohShiny> Fluttershy could be Artemis...
<spartan133t> boss?
<SpeedyBolt> SCREE
<twilight_sprinkle> teets
<spartan133t> Eeyup its a boss
<Cades> dont you hate when your nervous for no reason?
<Petrified_Discord> SpeedyBolt: There are times when she loses her magic, like when she's tired or scared
<OohShiny> weee Helios
<OohShiny> that Hyperion
<twilight_sprinkle> "behold the power of helius" very origina, game, gg
<SpeedyBolt> Kill kill kill kill die die die
<twilight_sprinkle> *original
<Buytoast> oh boy, Helios
<Buytoast> and his flaming chariot of fire
<twilight_sprinkle> im seriously, they talk in cliches
<twilight_sprinkle> they dont even have proper lines
<Petrified_Discord> Finishers, finishers everywhere!
<spartan133t> shit just got serious!
<OohShiny> interesting how Kratos kills colossus (statue made for helios) in the second game, and then kill helos in the third game
<cow334_gone> night every one
<twilight_sprinkle> bye cow334_gone
<NocturnalBlade> nite cow334_gone
<spartan133t> bye cow334_gone
<Petrified_Discord> Oh look, a centaur. Did I mention that I just killed the god of the dead? Just saying...
<twilight_sprinkle> OohShiny: yeah, he kills stuff.
<SpeedyBolt> He kills stuff because he does it.
<OohShiny> He kills motherfucking sisters of fate, that's impossible, and you all know why. Use Dr. Who logic.
<SpeedyBolt> YOU ARE DEAD
<Petrified_Discord> I love how they tried to give him a personality and make us feel for him. Just...just making him a fucking asshole murderer. They're cool. :D
<twilight_sprinkle> centaur is too much for the guy who killed death itself
<OohShiny> twilight_sprinkle: death itself is Thanatos
<OohShiny> twilight_sprinkle: but kratos kills him in Ghost of Sparta
<twilight_sprinkle> ok
<NocturnalBlade> didnt know there was a god of death...thought Hades filled that roll
<Petrified_Discord> OohShiny: Of fucking course he does :|
<SpeedyBolt> You didnt know about Thanatos, NocturnalBlade?
<twilight_sprinkle> oh look, there's blood in this game
<NocturnalBlade> SpeedyBolt: nnope
<Petrified_Discord> NocturnalBlade: Thanatos isn't the god of death, that's Hades. Thanatos is the personification of death.
<spartan133t> hes going to die i bet you
<OohShiny> twilight_sprinkle: you'll see some intestines now
<spartan133t> ok nvm .-.
<SpeedyBolt> I take it Kratos hates bronies.
<NocturnalBlade> spartan133t: do not doubt the Caramel
<twilight_sprinkle> kratos is a hater
<Petrified_Discord> He literally never likes anything or anyone :P
<OohShiny> kratos hates particularly everthing
<XisBestChemical> WHYKRATOSWHYMUSTYOUKILLPONY
<spartan133t> even his own weapons?
<OohShiny> he kills anything that moves, basically
<NocturnalBlade> Petrified_Discord: wow, learn something new everyday...have heard the word Thanatos before but never thought it was a name
<SpeedyBolt> So if I take a step near him
<SpeedyBolt> I die?
<twilight_sprinkle> OohShiny: i hope he finds a mirror
<OohShiny> twilight_sprinkle: he killed his past self in Ghost of Sparta too
<twilight_sprinkle> OohShiny: lol whatthefuck
<OohShiny> twilight_sprinkle: no Paradox happened
<spartan133t> WTF?!?!
<NocturnalBlade> oooo, dat chimera
<SpeedyBolt> What the HELL is that?!
<Petrified_Discord> Manticore! I mean, Chimera!
<AJIsAwesome> Testing.
<SpeedyBolt> Good thing its not the Ultimate Chimera
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: A+!
<XisBestChemical> Ultimate Chimera
<SpeedyBolt> or else Kratos would be screwed.
<Reikim> MAKINAIZE GUNLEON
<Reikim> Dammit
<Pearly> hey everypony
<NocturnalBlade> hi Pearly
<Reikim> That song's permanently in my head now.
<OohShiny> Sub-boss time!

<SpeedyBolt> THAT LOOKS LIKE A HOMING SHOT
<XisBestChemical> Pearly: Hi!
<Reikim> But really? I don't mind at all.
<SpeedyBolt> CAREFUL KRATOS
<thelonepony> hi Pearly
<Pearly> hey NocturnalBlade and twilight_sprinkle and XisBestChemical
<Pearly> how are you dears?
<Petrified_Discord> For a creature covered in fur, I don't think fire breath would be a great idea :/
<Pearly> ey darlin *smiles at thelonepony*
<SpeedyBolt> You know, I actually feel sorry for these...animal...things.
<NocturnalBlade> fine...watchin Caramel kill gods
<SpeedyBolt> He's murdering them in the most brutal ways...and its amusing to watch.
<OohShiny> SpeedyBolt: You're getting Fluttershy sickness
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Thanks. :D
<AJIsAwesome> SpeedyBolt: Worst part of the boss fight. :D
<AJIsAwesome> Pearly: Hi! :)
<OohShiny> SpeedyBolt: I suggest you to play DeadSpace
<XisBestChemical> :d
<Pearly> hey AJIsAwesome how are you?

<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Bye! :(
<twilight_sprinkle> SpeedyBolt: you bet she does. and she plays gta 4 and manhunt
<SpeedyBolt> Bye VenHur
<NocturnalBlade> Pearly: you open them yet?
<twilight_sprinkle> bye VenHur
<SpeedyBolt> Fluttershy sounds like my type of girl. Too bad I wouldnt date ponies.
<spartan133t> bye guys
<OohShiny> SpeedyBolt: you gotta learn that it's always the quiet ones
<thelonepony> bye Venhur
<Derpy_Hooves> night guys

<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: Bye! :(
<OohShiny> SpeedyBolt: and Fluttershy is my type too
<thelonepony> night Derpy_Muffins
<twilight_sprinkle> SpeedyBolt: she would choke you in your sleep
<SpeedyBolt> That sounds fun
<OohShiny> twilight_sprinkle: stop hating fluttershy, or I'll throw you in her shed
<Pearly> NocturnalBlade, yeah, they were rainbow dash and pinkie pie special editions (glitter)
<SpeedyBolt> But she told us specifically to "STAY OUT OF MY SHED"
<NocturnalBlade> careful shiny
<magmablock> Neat
<NocturnalBlade> and SpeedyBolt
<twilight_sprinkle> OohShiny: ill take you with me then!
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: i heard you hate fluttershy
<NocturnalBlade> Pearly: niiiice
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: severe dislike more than hate
<Pearly> yeah
<Petrified_Discord> Found it: http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&q=gamer+fluttershy#/d4lyvb3
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: well twilight was always worst pony to me
<Pearly> rainbow dash lookscool
<OohShiny> really? RD is worst for me
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: why?
<OohShiny> way too cocky
<OohShiny> hate cocky people AND ponies
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: everything
<NocturnalBlade> Petrified_Discord: lol
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: care to specify?
<SpeedyBolt> So Fluttershy and Luna are gamers, awesome.
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: i dont wanna get banned
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: or maybe youre just hating her because i dont like fluttershy?
<SpeedyBolt> DONT FALL DOWN OR YOULL DIE
<Kandarihu> So that Rage of Olympus dololly, you fill it with rage once and it stays filled for the rest of the game?
<SpeedyBolt> lol
<OohShiny> Twilight is in third place in my list
<Petrified_Discord> Ded for no reason. GJ Kratos
<SpeedyBolt> Kratos is offically better than I expected him to be
<OohShiny> Helios!
<OohShiny> Boss time!
<SpeedyBolt> ...Ew.
<Petrified_Discord> Why shieldmen no use their pikes?
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: she brags steals screentime never thanks never agreeful thinks she encharge of everything pony and fluttershy T_T
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: "and fluttershy" yep ive heard enough.
<SpeedyBolt> >Brags
<SpeedyBolt> >Steals screentime
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: anyways TO THE STREAM
<SpeedyBolt> You could say the same for Rarity in Season 2.
<twilight_sprinkle> and Twilight does NOT brag
<Pearly> hha there was a new thing I saw near MLP stuff... "Filly Princess" looks like g1 and g2 of MLP
<twilight_sprinkle> in fact she does the opposite
<SpeedyBolt> Ms. I'mSuddenlyHangingOutWithTheMane6.
<OohShiny> I don't like rarity that much, don't dislike her though
<twilight_sprinkle> like in the Trixie episode
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: from your most faithful student
<twilight_sprinkle> Twilight did the opposite of brag
<SpeedyBolt> Dont you remember Boast Bosters?
<SpeedyBolt> *busters
<magmablock> I wasn't a big fan of Rarity for a while, but she grew on me
<SpeedyBolt> She was scared about showing off, and all that crap.
<thelonepony> Ouch
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: ?
<SpeedyBolt> Rarity is a mule.
<OohShiny> I am a brony for 2 months already, don't like rarity too much yet
<OohShiny> I'll see season 3 first
<flutterchu> now i dont want to argue ill get banned
<Reikim> Rarity redeems herself in A Dog and Pony Show.
<OohShiny> and Kratos uses helios' head as a lantern
<SpeedyBolt> Rarity used to be my least favorite pony.
<SpeedyBolt> Now she's up there with everybody
<Reikim> Anyway
<AJIsAwesome> Did you seriously think Twilight was bragging? She said herself that she didn't want to use her magic to show off Trixie because she felt that her friends would think she's nothing but a braggart.
<Reikim> I don't really support best/worst pony arguments.
<SpeedyBolt> Dat sun power
<twilight_sprinkle> i wouldnt dislike fluttershy if her fans werent so "fluttershyisbestpony" all the time
<Ponies47> Good night everypony school tomorrow :)
<Pearly> wished Iknew bronys around my area..
<twilight_sprinkle> *wouldnt dislike as much
<NocturnalBlade> nite Ponies47
<SpeedyBolt> twilight_sprinkle: They're all wrong.
<Petrified_Discord> Look away!
<Caramel> it's not letting me
<thelonepony> night Ponies47
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Ponies47
<SpeedyBolt> Everybody knows PINKIE PI- I'm gonna shut up
<OohShiny> well I'm a fluttershy fan
<Petrified_Discord> Celestia defeats Kratos
<Reikim> I love the shit out of all of them. They all have their flaws and virtues. That is all there is to say on the matter and anything more comes down to personal opinion and really isn't worth anyone's time.
<SpeedyBolt> Kratos.
<magmablock> Everypony is nest pony. But Pinkie Pie is bestest.
<Reikim> Case fucking closed on this topic that everyone is sick of.
<Buytoast> all the fans are terrible
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Agreed.
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: ;~; not cool
<magmablock> best*
<OohShiny> I just try to defend her when people say they hate her
<Buytoast> there, i saved you a bunch of bitching
<SpeedyBolt> I'm terrible, Buytoast? :<
<JRP> wrek you played metroid?
<Buytoast> probably
<JESmith71> twilight_sprinkle: Amusingly you bring that up and we're watching that one tomorrow...er later tonight depending on timezone
<SpeedyBolt> You hurt my feelings.
<flutterchu> OohShiny: that's my job
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: well youre certainly not proving me opposite, hating on twilight so unobjectively
<twilight_sprinkle> *the
<SpeedyBolt> I'm trying to understand how Kratos died in that last part.
<twilight_sprinkle> JESmith71: she has a lot of episodes
<Petrified_Discord> Curbstomp
<NocturnalBlade> SpeedyBolt: by sun power
<magmablock> SpeedyBolt: probably backed off the cliff
<SpeedyBolt> Oh
<twilight_sprinkle> YOU CAKE
<OohShiny> I hate Rainbow Dash because she's fucking cocky, and I hate cocky people (also ponies)
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: lauren makes her the "main" character just because she's the only one that she reconizes now stop replying to me so i wont get banned
<JESmith71> twilight_sprinkle: I meant when you brought up Trixie and the bragging in particular since Boast Busters is being shown here
<SpeedyBolt> Oh...my...god...
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> looks like Kratos *shades* got a HEAD in life YEEEAAAHH!!
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: you wont get banned if you keep it civil.
<Biglaw> Holy hay GoW????
<twilight_sprinkle> i cant think of a good head pun!
<Petrified_Discord> ~DECAPITATIOOOOOOOOOOOON~
<NocturnalBlade> hi Biglaw
<SpeedyBolt> Better luck next time, twilight_sprinkle
<twilight_sprinkle> JESmith71: ah k
<Buytoast> rainbow horse is terrible because she's a cocky bitch and white horse is bad because she's a shallow whore
<Buytoast> the rest are tolerable
<OohShiny> Looks like kratos *shades* found the light at the end of the tunnel.
<SpeedyBolt> >Rainbow Horse
<SpeedyBolt> Not sure if trolling or not.
<OohShiny> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<JESmith71> twilight_sprinkle: For the main course, Kratos is serving up some head cheese!
<AJIsAwesome> JESmith71: Boo.............:D
<OohShiny> Herakles is next boss
<OohShiny> wee
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: honestly seems to me like youre just hating on twilight because she has more screentime than fluttershy, which is what i was talking about her fans
<Maid_RainBow> okay everypony i have to go now
<NocturnalBlade> bye Maid_RainBow
<Maid_RainBow> have a nice day all
<JESmith71> I dunno that was the most recent head joke I've heard lately. Quickest one that came to mind
<AJIsAwesome> Maid_RainBow: Bye! :)
<OohShiny> Herakles is next, I am so excited!
<SpeedyBolt> Bye Maid_Rainbow :3
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: yes
<Buytoast> of course i'm trolling, i have an opinion. having an opinion means i'm a darn dirty troll
<Buytoast> goddamn
<magmablock> What a headcase
<PillowPoni> Bye Maid_RainBow
<AJIsAwesome> magmablock: :D
*Ponies47 Goes the buck to sleep
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: well bravo, very objective of you. and thanks for proving my point about fluttershy fans
<Reikim> Oh for fuck's sake.
<SpeedyBolt> Typically, the main character introduced has lots of screentime.
<thelonepony> well time for me to sleep. cya everypony
<SpeedyBolt> You'd be hating EVERYbody.
<Reikim> For fuck's fucking sake and you know I'm pissed because I'm swearing.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> now Helios comes w/ HEADLIGHTS :D
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: Night! :)
<OohShiny> twilight_sprinkle: well, you insult me because of other fans?
<NocturnalBlade> nite thelonepony
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: but when did she ever deserve the screentime...........TAKE THAT!!!!!!!!
<Buytoast> twilight_sprikles been bitching up a storm all night
<twilight_sprinkle> OohShiny: no, i meant about some fluttershy fans that just are in your face i disliek fluttershy more, im not saying anything about the fluttershy fandom in general
<thelonepony> i'll put in the "go the fuck to sleep" video to help me
<SpeedyBolt> Hush now, Quiet now, its time to lay your sleepy head.
<Reikim> Oh for hell's sake someone shut these two up.
<OohShiny> Hush now, Quiet now, it's time to go to bed.
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: OBJECTION there just being thereselves
<thelonepony> zzz
<Petrified_Discord> Before you go to bed, just remember that there's probably a burglar in your house
<Reikim> Someone kick them or something?
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: *themselves?
<Reikim> Aaaaaaah
<Reikim> AAAAAAAGH
<Reikim> Fuck manechat.
<Reikim> TS is making an issue again.
<SpeedyBolt> There's a burgular outside my house.
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: cheering on what they love most TAKE THAT
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: honestly, its not fair to hate twilight because she has more screentime. i dont see how it can be fair
<OohShiny> SpeedyBolt: Quick! Kill him with fire!
<Buytoast> stop ruining phoenix wright you asshat
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> inb4 some mod chokes a bitch
<Buytoast> holy crap
<SpeedyBolt> I hit him with the glass I randomly had.
<AJIsAwesome> Are you guys kidding me? Each characters have their own characteristics, flaws and quirks. But that makes them who they are, and that's why we love them. There is no BEST PONY and there never will be because we all have different opinions that make us who we are. Whining and complaining about screen time is absolutely pathetic to me, because I don't care how much screentime they get as long as they receive good character development. Also, why are
<SpeedyBolt> Repeatedly.
<SpeedyBolt> and he ran.\
<SpeedyBolt> I agree with AJIsAwesome.
<Shizuka> 13in this thread, dozens of ponies that can't read the channel topic
<Reikim> I wish a mod would choke a bitch.
<OohShiny> I am not trying to make other people like fluttershy
<NocturnalBlade> SpeedyBolt: same
<SpeedyBolt> Choking is harmful, Reikim.
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: HOLD IT what harmony is there in magic
<OohShiny> just defending her, and exposing my opinions
<Buytoast> choking keeps things in line
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> agreed AJIsAwesome
<SpeedyBolt> Love and Tolerate.
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: the point of her character is sort of to hold the mane 6 together. yeah shes kinda the leader, again its not a reason to hate her
<Reikim> Ask Darth Vader. The odd choking keeps the minions in line.
<TheMaster> someone hating the best pony? what is this HERESY?
<OohShiny> Reikim: Lol
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: you dragged me into this so youve got the one to blame
<OohShiny> another one?
<NocturnalBlade> ohai TheMaster
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Either that or they had a bad taco at the cafeteria. :D
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> now what ?
<TheMaster> Good evening NocturnalBlade
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<NocturnalBlade> i hate these enemies
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i think this GoW is bringing out everypony's inner god killer :D
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: blame for what? im ok with expressing opinions, im just saying that imo hating twilight for being the leader and having a BIT more screentime than fluttershy is a bad reason
<Petrified_Discord> I remember that interview with Tara where she says roughly, "I don't get where this whole debate about best pony comes from. When was it not clear that Twilight is best pony? I thought that was known. :/" :D
<TheMaster> just came to gauge the excite levels for the possible!season3 announcement that may or may not be coming.
<SpeedyBolt> Do enemies like these usually take so long to kill?
<AJIsAwesome> Petrified_Discord: :D
<OohShiny> NocturnalBlade: the Magina-like enemies?
<Reikim> He's started an argument with flutterchy.
<Reikim> *flutterchu
<SpeedyBolt> No, Pinkie Pie is the best pony.
<Shizuka> 13this is doom 3 right
<Reikim> In which he pretends to be morally superior to everyone and everything. Again.
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: mmmmhhmmmmm a bit T_T
<TheMaster> Pinkie Pie is a funny way of spelling twilight.
<Shizuka> 13except darker
<SpeedyBolt> So is AJ, RD, Twilight, Fluttershy, Rarity, and everybody else.
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: fluttershy has TONS of screen time too
<Petrified_Discord> SpeedyBolt: But it is known :P
<NocturnalBlade> OohShiny: the what like?
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: have you been on the wiki
<SpeedyBolt> Carrot Top actually tastes of turnip.
<OohShiny> Magina-like
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: wiki for what?
<OohShiny> NocturnalBlade: ever played Dota?
<AJIsAwesome> Topic change: Who here has ever eaten brunch?
<Reikim> Really I don't know how he manages it.
<NocturnalBlade> OohShiny: nope
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: mlp fim
<SpeedyBolt> Meme
<Reikim> Half the time he's actually one of the more reasonable chatters.
<TheMaster> I have. but have you ever eaten brinner?
<NocturnalBlade> AJIsAwesome: lol...i dont think i have
<Petrified_Discord> Aw, but I like best pony debates :(
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: well maybe once or twice, why
<AJIsAwesome> TheMaster: :D
<NocturnalBlade> TheMaster: that i have done
<Shizuka> 13the proper form of the question is
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SppedyBolt how do you know tha- 0_o nvm i DONT wanna know :D
<Shizuka> 13DO YOU EAT
<TheMaster> brinner is best meal. pancakes at 11pm
<Reikim> Then you get him going, and oh, suddenly he's the onyl right one, everyone else is wrong, it's because they're the way they are not they're fault he can't possibly be wrong.
<SpeedyBolt> I dont eat, Shizuka.
<SpeedyBolt> :3
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: :$
<Reikim> AND THEN FAILS TO SHUT UP
<Petrified_Discord> TheMaster: Or steak at 6:30
<Shizuka> 13i don't eat either
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: it shows how many episode people have been or NOT been look at twilight page than look at fluttershy and the rest of the mane 6
<AJIsAwesome> TheMaster: Do you watch YTPs?
<twilight_sprinkle> OohShiny: have you played dota 2?
<OohShiny> not yet
<NocturnalBlade> TheMaster: steak and waffles yum
<TheMaster> Youtube poops? uh, not really
<Panda|Drawing> O-o
<OohShiny> but magina is there
<Shizuka> 13ponies are very very bad at "don't feed the trolls"
<OohShiny> and still the same fucking guy that holds 2 blades
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: that just might mean twilight has a lot of brief appearances, and since shes usually the voice of wisdom in the team, it makes sense
<TheMaster> they're all sort of the same and i've got plenty of spaghetti so I don't need to hear luigi say it 40 times.
<Reikim> flutterchu, twilight_sprinkle: Seriously, take it to another channel. Or PM, for God's sake, that thing exists for a reason.
<SpeedyBolt> Just let them do their thing, Reikim.
<Reikim> TS isn't a troll.
<Shizuka> 13can we stop with the pointless bitching about twlight..
<twilight_sprinkle> OohShiny: magina looks horrible in dota 2
<TheMaster> flutterchu? is chris-chan here?
<Reikim> He's just an egotist.
<AJIsAwesome> TheMaster: Oh. I thought you got the brinner idea from AlvinYTP. He made a poop about it.:D
<SpeedyBolt> See, everything falls into place.
<Petrified_Discord> Grab throw grab throw grab throw grab throw grab throw grab throw grab throw
<Buytoast> chris-chan is still in prison i believe
<JRP> SuperBrony64: i know your there
<OohShiny> I have something to say, don't hate ponies.
<SpeedyBolt> Petrified_Discord: I'm wondering...how can stone talk?
<TheMaster> he never went to prison in the first place
*LadyCanary flies over to Shizu and nestles in her mane.

<LadyCanary> Shizu Shizu
<LadyCanary> ^_^
<Buytoast> bah
<Buytoast> he needs to be in a cell
<SpeedyBolt> Oh my..
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Because everyone know ViVi is best pony and then Shizu :p
<Reikim> It's the arrogance.
<SpeedyBolt> Freefalling looks fun
<OohShiny> dis part is awesome
<Reikim> All the arrogance.
<Shizuka> 13i am not #2 .-.
<SpeedyBolt> Shizuka is best pony.
<Shizuka> 13i do not make top 9000
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka on my book you are, deal with it :3
<OohShiny> I say Raincloud is best pony
<Reikim> So your rank is *shades* over-
<Petrified_Discord> Shizuka: You're over 9000?
*Reikim is shot
<twilight_sprinkle> im sensing a over nine thousand joke here
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol i always died at this part once or twice
<SpeedyBolt> IT'S OVER- No.
<Shizuka> 13in this thread, obvious meme is obviously whooshed
<TheMaster> In the 21st millenium there is only ponies.
<flutterchu> im just wondering who's 2nd best pony
<Petrified_Discord> Whoooooosh~
<LadyCanary> Whoooosh~
<Reikim> Hey guess what
<TheMaster> and I will not tolerate Heresy when best pony is insulted.
<Reikim> GUESS FUCKING WHAT
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> FALCON PAWNCH
<Reikim> There are no pony ranks.
<NocturnalBlade> what Reikim
<kirzstryfe> good evening everypony :)
<SpeedyBolt> I want to go Skydiving one day.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai kirzstryfe
<Shizuka> 13kratos why are you stealing weapons from cloud strife now
<LadyCanary> Ni ni kirz <3
<NocturnalBlade> evening kirzstryfe
<AJIsAwesome> kirzstryfe: Hi! :)
<LadyCanary> LOL Shizuka. He's trying to be hip.
<Reikim> Evening kirzstryfe. I should not be awake. How are you?
<SpeedyBolt> Good...Night? kirzstryfe
<OohShiny> Shizuka: he stole it from Dante
*kirzstryfe glomps Shizuka runs away
<Petrified_Discord> Reikim: Yes there are. Shining Armor is Captain of the Royal Guard. :P
<Buytoast> any meme spewed out in here will be ovverused til there's nothing left
<SpeedyBolt> It's nearly 12 over here, and i'm still up.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey kirzstryfe how are ya?
<SpeedyBolt> I have school tomorrow, and I regret nothing.
<Buytoast> just like with reddit and 9gag
<TheMaster> why does he have wings?
<Reikim> Because everything needs wings.
<OohShiny> tomorrow is Independence Day in my country
<SpeedyBolt> Because Kratos is secretly a Pegasus.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> stole them from Icarus in GoW2
<OohShiny> so I don't give a fuck
<Reikim> Need to make something more hip? Add wings.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> TheMaster cause he is motherbucking Kratos that's why
<Reikim> Need to up the coolness factor? Add wings.
<Reikim> Need to make a poignant metaphor for the human spirit? Add wings.
<Petrified_Discord> Sketch_Toku_Brony: lol I read that as Gears of War 2 :P
<TheMaster> so they basically made a game by mashing all the greek stories together?
<Shizuka> 13he's bad at flying
<TheMaster> neat
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<Reikim> Need to add angelic sybolism? Add wings.
<OohShiny> Sketch_Toku_Brony it was not Icarus, it was Daedalus
<TheMaster> does Kratos fight achillies?
<twilight_sprinkle> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vZk13imFkqY/TecyzHdGqhI/AAAAAAAAFWc/U74VpB-Va0k/s1600/P4ZHZ.gif by this graph it actually seems like twilight has less screen time than fluttershy
<SpeedyBolt> Shouldnt Kratos' wings have burned up already, if he stole them from Icarus?
<TheMaster> Icarus' wings only burn when they go near the sun
<Reikim> Need to have copious amounts of molting feathers floating around for visual fun? ADD WINGS.
<TheMaster> a story warning about the hubris of man
<Reikim> Really, there is nothing that wings cannot do.
<OohShiny> it's not Icarus wings
<SpeedyBolt> Except make food for you.
<OohShiny> icarus died, and fell with his wing
*Spectrum_Rush deshi deshi basara basara
<SpeedyBolt> They cant make food for you.
<OohShiny> the wings are from daedalus
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> OohShiny no Daedalus is in this game,his son Icarus was in 2 trying to reach the sisters of fate
<Reikim> Wings can make food for you.
<SpeedyBolt> They can?
<TheMaster> Icarus' story also led to a very cool Iron Maiden song
<SpeedyBolt> I need to learn that tech.
<TheMaster> because Iron Maiden is excellent
<OohShiny> Sketch_Toku_Brony it was Daedalus man
<Reikim> Need to hunt down an animal and kill it? Add wings.
<Shizuka> 13assassin's creed, repetitive greek edition
<OohShiny> Sketch_Toku_Brony Icarus died, so Daedalus tried to talk to the sisters, so he could get his son back
<Petrified_Discord> Reverse leap of faith
<Reikim> Besides, Fluttershy has demonstrated to us that wings can be used dextrously.
<flutterchu> im not talking about seconds in episode im talking appearances
<Shizuka> 13it's the 3d missile flash game only more cluttered and without light
<Reikim> Oh god
<OohShiny> Sketch_Toku_Brony: He has the wings because he survived with them, whereas Icarus fell to the sea
<Reikim> Are you still going on about that
<Reikim> No
<Reikim> Shut up
<SpeedyBolt> Imagine if Fluttershy and RD's personalities got switched.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> OohShiny OH i remember now :$ lol have played these games in a while
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: calm down, youre more heated up about this than we are
*Spectrum_Rush deshi basara deshi basara deshi deshi basara basara
<Reikim> Because I've seen it over ten dozen times and guess what? It goes nowhere every single time.
<SpeedyBolt> Shut up is a harsh choice of words.
<Caramel> people, if I don't see calm in the chat soon, I'm going to start banning
<flutterchu> im not mad im just acting like phoenix wright
<Caramel> so either calm the fuck down, or leave
<twilight_sprinkle> gg Reikim
<TheMaster> i'm perfectly calm. -eyetwitch-
<NocturnalBlade> dat mad Caramel
<Buytoast> you're ruining phoenix wright*
*Reikim calms the fuck down
<SpeedyBolt> We've offically messed up.
<Shizuka> 13protip, my banhammer works just as well as val's
<OohShiny> I am talking about Mythology with Sketch, it's all in good fun
<Buytoast> so why is kratos trying to kill everything now?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> dat GOD of CARAMEL
<SpeedyBolt> GoC?
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: "now"?
<Buytoast> they screw him over or something?
<Petrified_Discord> Buytoast: Because that's his personality
<TheMaster> because Kratos wants a red lantern ring
<flutterchu> Shizuka: i thought only wrek had a ban hammer ?
<Shizuka> 13Buytoast: cause his character arc is over so it's just kill everything now
<Reikim> A god of tasty candy treats? That would be nice.
<Buytoast> he seemed pretty calm at the end of god of war 1
<TheMaster> Kratos of Sparta, you have the ability to inspire great rage.
<Reikim> Buytoast: That was before they wanted a sequel for the monies.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so Reikim did you smash your co author head already ?
<Shizuka> 13shipping and receiving departments OF THE GODS
<Reikim> Oh
<Reikim> Not yet.
<SpeedyBolt> Would any of you be scared if you had to do all of this?
<OohShiny> Buytoast: Zeus stole Kratos Pony plushie, so Kratos wants to kill Zeus and get his plushie back
<SpeedyBolt> I know I would.
<Reikim> He's a good sort, really.
<Reikim> I'm helping him with a TTGL fic now that he's rewriting.
<TheMaster> thats assuming i'm not a ultra buff spartan
<Buytoast> can someone explain it woithout using the crappy ass pony fill-ins?
<TheMaster> so obviously i'm not afraid
<Reikim> Reading all twenty chapters the first time, however, was a painful experience.
<Petrified_Discord> It's like at the end of GoW1, Kratos just took a bunch of peyote and then NEVER STOPPED. :|
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i thought you use a pool nodle Shizu
<twilight_sprinkle> OohShiny: is the final scene that he returns his plushie and its covered in zeus' blood?
<OohShiny> twilight_sprinkle: not actually, in the final scene, he gets his plushie, but the plushie is already destroyed, so he kills himself
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Ponychats Art September Challenge Announced
<Reikim> Buytoast: Let's be honest, it's not really important. Kratos kills things in graphic fashion. That's all they need to sell the game.
<twilight_sprinkle> OohShiny: yay happy ending!
<Buytoast> eh, fair enough
<SpeedyBolt> Reikim is right.
<Buytoast> i know they made these three
<Shizuka> 13extra credits did an episode on the series a while back
<SpeedyBolt> As long as death happens, anybody will buy it.
<TheMaster> they don't really make games for the 'story' these days
<Buytoast> they amde some for the psp, didn't they?
<Shizuka> 13and how disappointing it is that they destroyed the story they built in 1
<OohShiny> yes
<TheMaster> if you want good story in a video game play planescape torment
<twilight_sprinkle> SpeedyBolt: like love songs
<SpeedyBolt> Exactly.
<TheMaster> Planescape torment being the best video game story ever made
<OohShiny> Buytoast: Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta
<twilight_sprinkle> still, this game does have excellent visuals,ill give it that much
<Reikim> The funny thing? A premise like God of War's could have potential.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ttgl uhmm tengen toppa ?
<OohShiny> Buytoast: I've played the two and they are pretty good
<Shizuka> 13can't see it capn
<Buytoast> well i suppose if you're going to milk the cash cows press the tits for all you can get
<Reikim> Yup
<TheMaster> why would you kill iron will like that?
<TheMaster> you monster
<kirzstryfe> so, new job has me dressing up, business casual, near-suit type of stuff
<Reikim> The original was craaaaap
<twilight_sprinkle> they need a kids version of god of war, where blood is replaced with rainbows and the swords with squaky bats
<SpeedyBolt> Iron Will was a meanie, anyways
<AJIsAwesome> TheMaster: :D
<Reikim> Full of potential but craaaaaap
<Shizuka> 13they have one it's called tf2 with pyroland
<Reikim> I'm in the midst of fixing that.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe cause everyon know people can watch you over the phone
<kirzstryfe> stopped by walmart after work tonight to check for some stuff, got stopped by a guy asking for money >.<
<OohShiny> TheMaster: Iron Will gets back every 5 seconds
<NocturnalBlade> :D
*LadyCanary giggles.
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: How many maps are available on TF2?
<Reikim> kirzstryfe: Awwww. How'd that turn out?
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: i know they also have a kids version of counter-strike, its pretty hilarious
<Shizuka> 13all of them
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<Buytoast> iron will wasn't a bad guy you ignorant house invading belfry lurker
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<kirzstryfe> I have ~$17 in my bank account >.<
<LadyCanary> Shizu so funny :3
<Reikim> Whaaaaat
<kirzstryfe> his speech was far too rehearsed to be real, he was a con artist
<OohShiny> 2 iron wills no
<TheMaster> Demon's souls or dark souls wouldn't be a bad game to stream
<flutterchu> uuugggghhhh sooo much rainbow
<Reikim> Ah
<Reikim> Makes sense.
<TheMaster> I always like the video game adaptation to berserk myself. except when I die, which is alot
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> agreed TheMaster
<Reikim> Most people actually in need of money do not have the confidence to go up and ask someone.
<kirzstryfe> but since I looked like I make money, he came after me
<SpeedyBolt> I've always liked less violent video games.
<flutterchu> TheMaster: cary?
<SpeedyBolt> Though this does looks interesting.
<TheMaster> cary?
<Shizuka> 13ah quick time events
<Reikim> You do make money now.
<OohShiny> I've always liked Cars going Boom games, that's why I like burnout
<Reikim> ...You do make money now, right?
<flutterchu> TheMaster: is your name cary
<SpeedyBolt> Burnout <3
<kirzstryfe> walking through the store, earbuds in so I don't have to listen to people, yes, that makes it obvious that I want to stop to talk to him -.-
<TheMaster> my name is The Master
<Reikim> PRESS X TO SAVE THE INDUSTRY
<Shizuka> 13need to animate an interesting sequence but can't be bothered to have the player actually do it, try quick time events
<Buytoast> this game's got them out the shitter it seems
<TheMaster> and you will obey me
<NocturnalBlade> i loved Burnout
<kirzstryfe> I am, but nothing hits the bank account until this weekend
<Shizuka> 13acquite suit
<Shizuka> 13acquire sunglasses
<SpeedyBolt> Burnout was in my childhood too.
<flutterchu> TheMaster: nevermind
<Shizuka> 13acquire curly wire earpiece
<Shizuka> 13walk around
<SpeedyBolt> and that unbeatable Xbox game...Ninja Gaiden I think.
<LadyCanary> Press X to not die
<kirzstryfe> lol
<Reikim> They can't be any old sunglasses too.
<TheMaster> my true name is incomprehensible to humans. Unless you speak gallifreyan.
<Shizuka> 13occasionally stop and speak into your wrist or lapel or shoe
<OohShiny> SpeedyBolt: Man, that was hell
<twilight_sprinkle> i think x might be jump though
<kirzstryfe> I talked with the first employee I saw to get security on him
<AJIsAwesome> I only like QT events if they're done only a few times in a game.
<Reikim> They have to be the opaque, square kind.
<TheMaster> and Master Who? Just isn't as catchy
<OohShiny> SpeedyBolt: but the Nes version is worse, much much worse
<Reikim> I've honestly never seen anything like that before.
<JESmith71> Oh god, I just learned they're making a sequel to A Christmas Story
<SpeedyBolt> Oh god
<Reikim> The worst I've seen is beggars in the streets, which make me sad.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome agreed imo RE4 did it right lol
<flutterchu> TheMaster: i dont *back's away* i only speak english and can read japanese
<SpeedyBolt> OohShiny: I have to try that sometime, then :3
<AJIsAwesome> JESmith71: The Drink Your Ovaltine movie?
<Shizuka> 13not sure which is worse
<Shizuka> 13this
<SpeedyBolt> Hermes?
<OohShiny> wee Hermes
<Buytoast> oh, it's hermes
<twilight_sprinkle> oh its this guy
<Shizuka> 13or that useless crate bottomless pit in half life
<twilight_sprinkle> herpes
<Buytoast> GOTTA GO FAST
<TheMaster> Unacceptable, get learning Galliferyan.
<OohShiny> ultra hyper
<kirzstryfe> said he was an engineer, truck out of gas and had to get down to tampa (3h drive), dropped his phone in the sewer (in florida...), wearing a shirt that looks like he works at foot locker, saying he'd pay me back double tomorrow
<OohShiny> dat gay voice
<SpeedyBolt> He's not gay
<TheMaster> not the upskirt I was hoping for
<LadyCanary> inb4 YOU'RE TOO SLOW
<SpeedyBolt> He's flamboyant
<SpeedyBolt> :3
<Reikim> Bullshit.
<NocturnalBlade> dat laugh
<Petrified_Discord> He's quite happy
<kirzstryfe> eeyup
<Reikim> Anyone saying they're going to take your money and pay you back is bullshit.
<Reikim> Always.
<twilight_sprinkle> kill blood, how do?
<SpeedyBolt> This guy is begging for death, isnt he?
<OohShiny> hermes is mad pinkie
<TheMaster> most of the gods in greek myths were at various times bros.
<TheMaster> only hera was ever a bitch it seemed
<Reikim> First question: he's three hours away, how is he going to pay you back?
<Reikim> He's not even a good con.
<TheMaster> which made zues wanting to cheat understandable.
<kirzstryfe> "broke my ankle, just got out of the hospital", walked just fine to catch up with me, and I walk fast
<Reikim> Zeus didn't just cheat.
<TheMaster> Hades being the broest of gods.
<Petrified_Discord> Yay climbing yay
<Buytoast> Kratos is TOO SLOW
<twilight_sprinkle> dat action
<SpeedyBolt> Kratos should teach me how to climb.
<twilight_sprinkle> so hardcore
<Reikim> Calling Zeus a cheater is like calling a forest fire a tiny little blaze.
<kirzstryfe> he was a fast talker, most people you'd find in walmart at 12am aren't too bright
<AJIsAwesome> SO PARKOUR
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol BROseidon god of the BROcean!
<Petrified_Discord> Ohai final stage
<kirzstryfe> throw enough info at someone and something will catch, that's the theory
<OohShiny> Petrified_Discord: Long way to go bro
<JESmith71> AJIsAwesome: Yes. I'm watching the trailer. The kid's older. However it looks like it's going to be DTV
<flutterchu> FINAL BOSS!?!?!?!?!?!?!
<Reikim> Hades is broest of gods. Science fact.
<OohShiny> flutterchu: not yet
<AJIsAwesome> JESmith71: Not sure if excited or worried.
<OohShiny> flutterchu: some hours of gaming
<NocturnalBlade> flutterchu: not even close
<Reikim> I suppose.
<flutterchu> OohShiny: SHI-shitfuck
<Reikim> I guess not everyone's as paranoid as I am...
<Petrified_Discord> OohShiny: Yup. Gotta enter the dream and pretend to resolve his family issues
<OohShiny> still need to kill hermes, herakles
<Spectrum_Rush> EXPOSITION
<SpeedyBolt> I am so thirsty...brb.
<OohShiny> and some others I don't remember
<OohShiny> and fuck Aphrodite
<kirzstryfe> they're usually just high, drunk, or idiots at that time of night
<Canadian_Brony> Hello everypony.
<TheMaster> why would you kill herakles?
<Canadian_Brony> God of War?
<Reikim> And I'm guessing you don't fall into any of the three.
<kirzstryfe> nope, just bored
<twilight_sprinkle> hi Canadian_Brony and yes
<kirzstryfe> :)
<OohShiny> TheMaster: because he's at the gods' side?
<Canadian_Brony> this isn't one. Two or Three?
<Petrified_Discord> Poke the box with a big stick?
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Hello! :)
<OohShiny> TheMaster: and he mover?
<twilight_sprinkle> 3
<Reikim> ...I wonder how often Saxy gets accosted by cons?
<Canadian_Brony> k
<Reikim> :P
<TheMaster> >working with athena.
<TheMaster> >he's a spartan
<kirzstryfe> lol >.<
<TheMaster> what?
<TheMaster> spartans should hate athena
<Petrified_Discord> TheMaster: He does. :P He hates everyone
<Shizuka> 13this door is locked
<twilight_sprinkle> why force the player to button mash to open a box
<Shizuka> 13you have the power to kill a GOD
<Shizuka> 13but this door is locked
<OohShiny> TheMaster: well he killed athena already
<kirzstryfe> Shizuka never gets con'd, because she'd have to go outside first :3 <3
<Reikim> Hey look, there's a Greek historian over there! Awww, he says that the GoW team wouldn't accept him because they couldn't be bothered to give a damn.
<Buytoast> The Door God is quite poweful you know
<Petrified_Discord> He is not the God of Locks, evidently
<Shizuka> 13among about a thousand other things
<Buytoast> that's authentic hickory
<TheMaster> don't underestimate the power of locked doors Shizuka. even the doom marine couldn't get in locked doors without a key
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Shizuka perhaps he isnt the Master of Unlocking like Jill?
<Canadian_Brony> I'm going out on a limb and saying Caramel is streming.
<Reikim> I dunno
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Yep.
<kirzstryfe> and she's extremely people-phobic
*kirzstryfe hugs Shizuka
<Reikim> The Nigerian prince doesn't require you to go outside.
<kirzstryfe> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> he walks funny with the head
<SpeedyBolt> Guys
<TheMaster> someone up there was takign a swipe at me about knowing greek myths.
<OohShiny> Kills Immortals. Can't open metal doors. God of War logic 6_9
<NocturnalBlade> yo SpeedyBolt
<SpeedyBolt> We're out of lemonade, all I have is tap water now :<
<Shizuka> 13he promised me four hundred million dollars if only i would sell amway
<NocturnalBlade> noooo
<Reikim> TheMaster: Nah, I was poking fun at the GoW team for not bothering.
<TheMaster> ah
<Petrified_Discord> Dude, water is fucking awesome
<TheMaster> Atleast they tried with dantes infenro
<TheMaster> which made it sorta cool
<Reikim> Kind of.
<Petrified_Discord> Sort of
<kirzstryfe> 4 million money
<Reikim> Though I haven't really read that one.
<twilight_sprinkle> Petrified_Discord: actuall,y all people who drank water, have died
<Reikim> *played
<SpeedyBolt> I like bottled water, but not something that comes from a sink
<AJIsAwesome> How WAS Dante's inferno? Was it good?
<Reikim> I read the Inferno, never played the game.
<TheMaster> Inferno is pretty boss.
<OohShiny> Dante's inferno wasn't that good
<TheMaster> and the game was decenttier.
<TheMaster> rip off of god of war
<TheMaster> as they all are
<Reikim> Disappointed, I am.
<OohShiny> I have a whim for Devil May Cry
<TheMaster> just like all shooters rip off gears of war these days.
<Petrified_Discord> twilight_sprinkle: "I ain't going to no hospital. Everyone I've ever known who shot themselves has gone to a hospital. WHERE THEY DIED. Coincidence? I think not."
<Reikim> OohShiny: That the series isn't dead?
<SpeedyBolt> All shooters are basically remakes of one another
<twilight_sprinkle> Petrified_Discord: indeed, dont trust the hospitals
<Shizuka> 13kratos
<OohShiny> Reikim: The fifth one is being developed
<Shizuka> 13killer of gods
<SpeedyBolt> REHASHREHASHREHASH -shot-
<twilight_sprinkle> Petrified_Discord: altho i dont know what youre quoting
<Reikim> OohShiny: You seen Dante's new design?
<Shizuka> 13walks around with a flashlight like a ballerina
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<OohShiny> Reikim: It sucks
<TheMaster> like the scooby gang
<Petrified_Discord> twilight_sprinkle: That makes two of us
<Shizuka> 13i expect him to plie now
<SpeedyBolt> Kratos is a true man.
<twilight_sprinkle> Petrified_Discord: lol
<TheMaster> jinkies athena, we better split up to catch old man zues before he scares everyone away
<Reikim> OohShiny: Yeah, I'm not touching that one. I considered it, because I'd like to play DmC, but then I saw that and...yeah.
<Petrified_Discord> twilight_sprinkle: I just memorize shit, I don't cite my sources XD
<TheMaster> now I want to watch scooby doo
<Petrified_Discord> Congrats, you found the altar of plot progression
<OohShiny> oh... puzzles
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i think DmC will be good,at least its an AU story :$
<Shizuka> 13the muses
<Shizuka> 13is this where zero to hero kicks in?
<kirzstryfe> Reikim, why aren't you levelled enough to play in the dungeon yet?
<Reikim> I've never had a con try me...but then, I've never been wandering aroudn Wal-Mart alone at 12 AM
<Sonny> oh cool god of war?
<Reikim> Shut uuuuup
<Reikim> I only get one or two levels a day.
<Caramel> shizu: already killed the muses in 2
<Reikim> I'm at 20 as of half an hour ago.
<Petrified_Discord> Oh look, it's Twinkletoes
<kirzstryfe> walmart after 11pm is entertaining, but better with friends
<OohShiny> heya hermes

<Canadian_Brony> NocturnalBlade Olympus
<twilight_sprinkle> so killing herpes unleashed bees all over the world?
<NocturnalBlade> Canadian_Brony: close enough
<NocturnalBlade> OohShiny: same
<OohShiny> twilight_sprinkle: yup, that's about it
<Canadian_Brony> twilight_sprinkle One, Hermes with a "m". Two, yeah
<Canadian_Brony> go figure
<SpeedyBolt> You stole Herbees' boots, you get Herbees.
<twilight_sprinkle> Canadian_Brony: i know his name is hermes..

<twilight_sprinkle> the world is liek AH NOT THE BEES right now
<IshUpTooLatePony> As irl mortals, we would instantly turn into a puddle if we went that fast, or catch on fire, or both
<twilight_sprinkle> and chat is liek AH NOT THAT CLICHE JOKE
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<SpeedyBolt> Actually
<OohShiny> IshUpTooLatePony: That's why I wish I could teleport
<SpeedyBolt> I think if you had enough willpower and stuff...you could control it.
<magmablock> I guess Hermes was the messenger god, and the god of not having bees all over the place
<NocturnalBlade> oh...yea teleport might be better lol
<SpeedyBolt> I myself want the technique of Chronokinesis.
<twilight_sprinkle> portal gun
<NocturnalBlade> magmablock: :D
<sub06905> Poor Hermes never stood a chance agianst Krados: http://slurmed.com/fanart/gq/011_lazy-hermes.jpg

<NocturnalBlade> ...whats cronokinesis again?
<OohShiny> control time
<Canadian_Brony> the ability to control time
<NocturnalBlade> thought so
<twilight_sprinkle> i would use chronokinesis for godly things, like extending my time on a quiz
<SpeedyBolt> I would just use it to rewind my mistakes.
<OohShiny> if I used it in my body to stop aging, I could live FOREVEEEER!
<SpeedyBolt> Like
<SpeedyBolt> Say I wanted to confess to this girl
<Canadian_Brony> NocturnalBlade "Crono" is "Time", "Kineses" is "Control with Mind". IOW, "Controllng time with your mind"
<SpeedyBolt> If I screw up/get slapped, I can rewind and pretend it NEVER happened
<Canadian_Brony> useful
<flutterchu> flies?
<OohShiny> well, if I was in an exam, I would pause time, go search how to do the question, and then go back
<SpeedyBolt> Bees.
<Canadian_Brony> I could actually say my awesome thing to say 4 hours after the conversation!
<SpeedyBolt> See, now you're thinking with Crono.

<SpeedyBolt> *?
<OohShiny> twilight_sprinkle: they could just make kratos die from an illnes
<SpeedyBolt> Dat hallway
<flutterchu> blue
<twilight_sprinkle> SpeedyBolt: why not?
<magmablock> If the sisters of fate control all events, doesn't that technically make them more powerful than pretty much all the gods put together?
<SpeedyBolt> ...Good point.
<flutterchu> blue iz my fovorite color
<Canadian_Brony> and she isn't dead yet?
<OohShiny> magmablock: yup
<twilight_sprinkle> magmablock: god of war logic
<SpeedyBolt> The sisters of fate hate me, apperantly.
<twilight_sprinkle> magmablock: or rather lack of

<flutterchu> the 8 bit little mac
<OohShiny> flutterchu: yo, that's herakles
<Kencolt> Canadian_Brony: Specifically, high ranking. Lower ranking officers wore a front-to-back crest, and rank and file wore crestles helmets. I watch a CRAPLOAD of H2 and the Military Channel.
<twilight_sprinkle> impaled by spikes? no prob
<Canadian_Brony> this year, my history will include aboriginals which, apparantely, is so dull the funniest teacher in the SCHOOL has trouble making it fun
<SpeedyBolt> Kratos must have a bunch of blood in him...or something.
<OohShiny> impaled by spikes? I call Mortal Kombat
<SpeedyBolt> Mabye no internal organs?
<Kencolt> Canadian_Brony: At least in theory... in practice the crest mant Officerf, and orientation was kinds laz in battle.

<SpeedyBolt> ...Actually, most vodeo game logic.
<OohShiny> Herakles is Tiny Tiger
<flutterchu> nintendo logic these days...
<Spectre> How did Hercules shrink??
<Canadian_Brony> how did Luna grow?
<SpeedyBolt> How does Celestia look so young?
<OohShiny> Luna can be any side she wants
<Spectre> How did the world turn upside down
<twilight_sprinkle> i heard someone mentioning something about him dying of fear
<OohShiny> she's a fucking goddess for Celestia's sake
<twilight_sprinkle> maybe he got smaller from fear
<Canadian_Brony> How much wood would a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood?
<twilight_sprinkle> Canadian_Brony: some
<magmablock> 40 gallons
<SpeedyBolt> I thought he died there
<flutterchu> 12
<AJIsAwesome> No offense, Hercules, but you should've payed attention instead of turning your back to your opponent.
<flutterchu> Canadian_Brony: chuck norris
<SpeedyBolt> It's simple logic, guys
<Canadian_Brony> flutterchu -_(\
<JRP|temp> SuperBrony64|Zzz: dat like yayayayaya
<OohShiny> How much sword would a sword chuck chuck if a sword chuck could chuck sword?
<AJIsAwesome> Rule #1 of a fight: Never have your back turned.
<SpeedyBolt> When you think you've won, let ALL your guard down
<SpeedyBolt> Didnt Chrysalis do this?
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome rule #2: never dig straight up. No wait, that's Minecraft
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: :D
<SpeedyBolt> I can dig into air.
<twilight_sprinkle> wow hes actually dying
<twilight_sprinkle> ded
<OohShiny> lol
<SpeedyBolt> Atleast he doesnt have to restart the whole fight
<twilight_sprinkle> so the "less cloth-more power" argument must be true!
<OohShiny> bear hug
<SpeedyBolt> Then I shall fight naked, the next tme.
<SpeedyBolt> *time
<twilight_sprinkle> kratos is almost naked too
<Canadian_Brony> SpeedyBolt I will fight less than naked!
<SpeedyBolt> ...Noskin?
<OohShiny> ancient greece, they are all naked
<Canadian_Brony> wha-I dunno
<Canadian_Brony> sure
<Sylandest> the buck did I walk into here?
<Sylandest> :D
<SpeedyBolt> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> aw but he just wanted a hug
<Squallken> here we go :D
<SpeedyBolt> All he wants is a hug, Kratos.
<SpeedyBolt> Show some brolove
<flutterchu> he turned from herankles to hulk :O
<OohShiny> wow
<Canadian_Brony> hi Sylandest. Welcome to random plus stream. But mostly random. And stream.
<SpeedyBolt> ...Shit
<SpeedyBolt> Did he really do that?
<Squallken> ouch ouch ouch
<OohShiny> when they said Herakles was powerful, didn't think of this
<Canadian_Brony> dat face

<Sylandest> Canadian_Brony: I like the sound of this
<Sylandest> also ow
<SpeedyBolt> BONK

<OohShiny> why kratos is fluttershy?
<Canadian_Brony> they are both awesome
<Canadian_Brony> idk
<magmablock> "All that shit you shield guys gave me before, I don't even give a FUCK about!"
<twilight_sprinkle> cause fluttershy is evil!
<SpeedyBolt> Because Fluttershy could potentially kill everything in her path, if she wanted to
<flutterchu> Canadian_Brony: in soviet russia wall F**k's you :D
<Canadian_Brony> Not a single fuck was given that day
<OohShiny> fluttershy says she loves everything in cutie mark chronicles, kratos is the complete opposite

<Canadian_Brony> SpeedyBolt I think she died when you heard the "crunch" and blood-curling scream
<TheRandomkid321> I never got into the God of War series.
<AJIsAwesome> I still think Doom is a far more bloodier game than this. :D
<Canadian_Brony> it is
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah it is
<AJIsAwesome> TheRandomkid321: Same here.
<Allegr0> Hey all

<Allegr0> I will everyone! We're just under 14 hours out
<Kinixys> AJIsAwesome: HI AJ!
<SpeedyBolt> Is he reason you're so ugly, too?
<OohShiny> BOSS TIME
<Allegr0> Aj, gigas driving :P
<Canadian_Brony> SpeedyBolt wouldn't doubt it
<TheRandomkid321> I assume this hgame has no strong plot and is just blood and sex coated in a thin shell that is the story?
<twilight_sprinkle> TheRandomkid321: eeeeeeeeyup
<SpeedyBolt> No. I cant.
<OohShiny> ouch
<Canadian_Brony> so he IS the reason he's so ugly!
<SpeedyBolt> lol
<SpeedyBolt> I knew it!
<TheRandomkid321> Oh god the voice acting is equaly as bad.
<SpeedyBolt> Tartarus
<Canadian_Brony> Tartarus is a bottomless pit of empty blackness.
<OohShiny> wee, let's visit tartarus again
<SpeedyBolt> So is Cerberus down there, and Twilight?
<OohShiny> no
<OohShiny> Cerberus is at the gates of Herebos
<twilight_sprinkle> dat laugh
<OohShiny> this is no Equestria, you know
<SpeedyBolt> It looks like it
<SpeedyBolt> :p
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah the zombies do make it looks like ponyville
<Canadian_Brony> Hooray for magic!
<SpeedyBolt> Maigc Upgrade!
<OohShiny> Power-up!
<Canadian_Brony> Centaur
<SpeedyBolt> Program Advance!

<NocturnalBlade> well i think im off to bed..night everypony and thanks Caramel for the blood and such ^_^
<Kinixys> Bring friendship to Tartarus, Kratos!
<Canadian_Brony> g'night NocturnalBlade
<SpeedyBolt> D'aww D:
<twilight_sprinkle> bye NocturnalBlade
<SpeedyBolt> Bye NocturnalBlade
<Kinixys> Oh wait...
<twilight_sprinkle> zombies and a centaur. yep, thats new
<AJIsAwesome> NocturnalBlade: Night! :)
<TheRandomkid321> God I cannot believe how this became such a popular series. The story is horrible and barely existant, the voice acting is crappy, and it barely seems like a challenge. Bloody hell. I want to back to 1983 so I could play the NES.
<Canadian_Brony> twilight_sprinkle and this isn't even Tartarus yet
<twilight_sprinkle> TheRandomkid321: its the perfect game for the average teenager
<SpeedyBolt> I dont want to play this, but it looks very intersting to me.
<twilight_sprinkle> TheRandomkid321: and there are lotsa average teenagers
<TheRandomkid321> twilight_sprinkle true.
<OohShiny> well I'm a teenager, but I love retro games
<TheRandomkid321> OohShiney Me too but that isn't the average teenager.
<OohShiny> my friends call me crazy, but they don't know how to appreciate old games
<SpeedyBolt> I have my gamecube hooked up right now, it's on Sonic Heroes' menu screen
<twilight_sprinkle> OohShiny: then not average :P
<OohShiny> they always talk about graphics
<Canadian_Brony> TheRandomkid321 pick up a controller, get to my age, and look for a blood and gore game with puzzle solving, reflexes, and not FPS
<twilight_sprinkle> tbh i never liked the old games, they seemed to repetitive for me
<twilight_sprinkle> like mario
<SpeedyBolt> Earthbound?
<TheRandomkid321> I still have my old N64 with the first game I ever palyed EVER.
<Canadian_Brony> Who play video games for story nowadays?
<SpeedyBolt> DK64 was the first game I ever played.
<OohShiny> I do
<Canadian_Brony> if I want a story I'll read a book
<TheRandomkid321> Canadian_brony... me.
<twilight_sprinkle> Canadian_Brony: i can always enjoy a good story
<SpeedyBolt> I loved that game with all of my life.
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: *Looks at Shadow Of The Colossus.*
<OohShiny> the first game I ever played was Sonic in a Sega Master System
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome never heard of it
<TheRandomkid321> RDR has a great story from beginning to end and, although it is existant, it's more than just blood and sex.
<JESmith71> Canadian_Brony: Well there's RPGs since those are more story-centric
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: What? :O
<TheRandomkid321> Canadian_Brony... Get out!
<SpeedyBolt> >Never heard of Shadow of the Colossus
<Canadian_Brony> JESmith71 true
<SpeedyBolt> ...Do you...live under a rock?
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome you read correctly
<twilight_sprinkle> hes patrick?
<SpeedyBolt> I dont think he's pink
<SpeedyBolt> or fat
<Canadian_Brony> SpeedyBolt no I live in a house
<Canadian_Brony> TheRandomkid321 no thank you
<SpeedyBolt> A pinapple under the sea?
<Canadian_Brony> no
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Shadow Of The Colossus is an indie action platformer that is known for its amazing story and gameplay. I highly recommend you check it out.
<Canadian_Brony> nowhere close
<TheRandomkid321> Canadian_Brony A journey into the mind of an average teenager.
<SpeedyBolt> Most of the dumb teens I know STILL play games like CoD
<Canadian_Brony> TheRandomkid321 far from it. Calling me "average" is like calling the UK dry
<twilight_sprinkle> still, like i said, good cisual design in GoW
<twilight_sprinkle> *visual
<SpeedyBolt> I ignore physically, but mentally i'm just all "Why?"
<SafariMonkey> Hi guys
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome I will make a mental note of it and forget in the morning
<Canadian_Brony> hi SafariMonkey
<SpeedyBolt> Hello SafariMonkey
<TheRandomkid321> Canadian_Brony Well you don't play old games. You don't play games for story...
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi SafariMonkey

<SafariMonkey> It's that beautiful time before school
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: :D
<twilight_sprinkle> hes aalmsot ded
<TheRandomkid321> Anyway onto another subject.
<Sylandest> ded
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: But seriously, the game's pretty good. It's known as one of the best video games of all time.
<Canadian_Brony> TheRandomkid321 the oldest games I play are Mario games
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: shadow of the colossus is that good huh?
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I wouldn't say THAT good, but it's a good game nevertheless. :D
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome and I thought Bioshock got alot of praise
<SpeedyBolt> The only game with guns I ever liked was Goldeneye on the N64.
<SpeedyBolt> Otherwise no.
<TheRandomkid321> My SOSE teacher is a barstard. I used to like him until today when he gave us the task sheet for our assesment he gave us a "simplified" version expecially for our class. Geez it's like we don't understand correct english.
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: I never could get into Bioshock, IMO.
<SafariMonkey> So what's the game?
<SpeedyBolt> Is your class full of idiots?
<SpeedyBolt> Or did anybody piss him off recently that you know of?
<TheRandomkid321> SpeedyBolt... Yes now that you mention it... I cans tartle them with a complex sentence.
<twilight_sprinkle> TheRandomkid321: whats SOSE
<TheRandomkid321> twilight_sparkle Social Science.
<AJIsAwesome> TheRandomkid321: It's mostly likely the standards the current generation is displaying that's causing him to do this.
<AJIsAwesome> *most likely*
<twilight_sprinkle> TheRandomkid321: mkay. btw press tab when typing a name for it to autocomplete
<OohShiny> well, I think I'll be hitting the hay now
<twilight_sprinkle> bye OohShiny

<twilight_sprinkle> bye TheRandomkid321
<Canadian_Brony> TheRandomkid321 eugh. I have planning this year and I have to show of one of my "skills" tomorrow and try to teach the class how to do it. I know for a fact you simply can't teach one to sing. A particular song, yes. In general is like making love in a canoe.
<SpeedyBolt> GL, and cya later.
<Canadian_Brony> seeya SpeedyBolt
<SpeedyBolt> Wait

<scottish-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: im good my online school is esyer than exspted
<SafariMonkey> twilight_sprinkle: Square cube law does non necessarially apply to mythological creatures, due to the exemptionay amendment, 622BC

<scottish-geeky> Ninjazz: Lednitos killed a god king
<Ninjazz> Feh. A persian king.
<scottish-geeky> Ninjazz: who kalled him self a good
<Ninjazz> Might as well been an Egyptian pharooh.
<Ninjazz> (sp)
<scottish-geeky> lol
<Kencolt> Yes... Kratos and Leonidas would get along like a house on fire. And by that I mean lots of screaming, panic, and people running all around in confused fear.
<Moopy> Hey guys my mom is getting me a eletric scooter for Christmas

<Garrus> context
<Caramel> keep the chat clean please

<Ninjazz> Phase4, if by nation they mean the internet?
<Ninjazz> Oh shite.

<Phase4> Ninjazz, awww, i was gona yell Boo
<Ninjazz> I can't let you do that, Phase4.
<Phase4> Ninjazz, its an odd read, also ties in with another fic, probably by the same guy
<Ninjazz> Phase4, oh... if that's the case I might hold off on it. Don't want to read another fic to understand the concept of this one. >.<
<Phase4> Ninjazz, its a minor tie in, share a character
*Spectrum_Rush tackle hugs Ninjazz back ohaii :3
<Phase4> Spectrum_Rush, BOO!

<Ninjazz> Hello, DaringDerpy.
<Ninjazz> Also, Gold_Demona.
<Ninjazz> And now it's NOT time for calibrations.
<DaringDerpy> talking blue lights bring no good
<Gold_Demona> They can only lead to blue light specials
<Ninjazz> And then moral of the story.
<DaringDerpy> slaughter the zombie god and the game is over
<Gold_Demona> Needs more cob cannon.
<Ninjazz> HOLD. DEVIL'S POT OF TEA. MULAN.
<DaringDerpy> he has no health bar. how can you fight gods without health bar?
<Gold_Demona> Spam circle button
<Kencolt> Apparently this was too bloody even for this game. That SCARES me.
<DaringDerpy> oh f..., it's 12am already. another wasted day
<Ninjazz> Personally, I thought Posidon's part was more brutal.
<DaringDerpy> 12pm? pm...
<Gold_Demona> It's almost 6am over here
<DaringDerpy> what's the name of this toy?
<Wirisme> 11am

<DaringDerpy> what is the halo slavegirl doing there?
<Futtershy2000> whats this
<DaringDerpy> yes, the only fun I will have at the moment will be in complaints
<Moopy> see like even yesterday the youtube screens got a little bit bigger but now its smaller what the buck
<DaringDerpy> 80% of what I saw so far were interactive movies
<DaringDerpy> game over?
<Wirisme> Youtube.. you never know what they're going to do next
<DaringDerpy> it didn't change for me
<DaringDerpy> same youtube as always
<Moopy> well on my screen it got smaller
<Gold_Demona> Isn't there a button to make it bigger?
<DaringDerpy> this is not how the god business works
<Ninjazz> And then trilogy over.
<DaringDerpy> call your lawyer, women!
<DaringDerpy> -e +a
<Ninjazz> Now time for some prequals.
<DaringDerpy> fireworks time
<Caramel> well, can't believe I went over time for so long
<Caramel> jeez...oh well

<Moopy> i did
<Ninjazz> Thanks for playing it whole, Caramel.

<Phase4> Random, so you psuedo random or true random/
<Phase4> derp shift
<DaringDerpy> no true random on the internets
<Wirisme> can anyone tell me what that game's called?
<Ninjazz> Random can be whatever Random wants.
<DaringDerpy> this god game...no idea what's the name
<DaringDerpy> part 3 or so
<DaringDerpy> http://web.archive.org/web/20050731010142/http://www.youtube.com/ internet
<CrimsonPhoenix> DaringDerpy, RIP Youtube
<Phase4> U-Toob
<Phase4> DaringDerpy, i think the current design is better
<DaringDerpy> It was probably some unloved side project back then
<Ninjazz> Phase4, same. Or we probably just got used to it by now. :/
<Phase4> wonder if its still a bunch of python scripts
<Phase4> Ninjazz, no, current one is better, the old one doesnt encourage the video crawling behaviour the current one does
<Ninjazz> Like the first few days after every Youtube change, everyone bitches about it then there's the point where everyone just deals with it.
<Ninjazz> Phase4, Ah. I see what you mean.
<Phase4> http://web.archive.org/web/20070102235047/http://www.youtube.com/watch.php?v=_eoppP5jBoM the layout has stayed mostly the same though
<Phase4> wonder if that video is still there
<Phase4> Ninjazz, i like how i mentioned it was a bunch of python scripts when clearly it says watch.php
<Ninjazz> You lost me at python scripts, Phase4.
<Phase4> Ninjazz, that web archive was taken in 2005, video hat 850 views
<Phase4> it now has 950
<Phase4> had'
<Ninjazz> Hmmm.
<Moopy> well im off to bed everypony i'll talk to yall in the moring ok..........peace
<Phase4> night moobull69
<Phase4> i meen Moopy
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Moopy
<Phase4> >_>
<Ninjazz> Gnight, moops. Sleepies well.
<Moopy> aight later
*AdamTheDuck licks Moopy
<DaringDerpy> good night Moopy
<Moopy> thanks
<Wirisme> bye moopy
*Phase4 hugs Dumori
<Phase4> i meen
<Phase4> wait
<AdamTheDuck> Dem tab fails :D
<Ninjazz> Phase4, back when there was a choice between 1 and 5 for ratings.
<Phase4> y u quit after join Dumorimasoddaa
<Phase4> Ninjazz, the yes/no like system probably works better tbh
<Ninjazz> Because he knew you were going to hug him. :p
<Wirisme> lol I miss the youtube stars
<Ninjazz> I agree.
<Ninjazz> But I missed the ability to choose. :3
<DaringDerpy> I wonder if reddit had a 5 star system at start
<DaringDerpy> or digg
<DaringDerpy> facebook
<TheRandomkid321> This anti againg ad has a pic of a badly editied baby photo to give it facial hair :|
<Wirisme> I know it's hilariously bad
<Wirisme> :D
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck BTW I failed the milk challenge. Aout 1/3 left whatever I put in my mouth came right out.
<TheRandomkid321> Chat derp?
<TheRandomkid321> No.... Dabuck is everyone?
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, lolwut :D
<AdamTheDuck> So the challenge is to drink all 3L and then spew it out?
<AdamTheDuck> And we're all ded
<Ninjazz> But some of us might be Still Alive.
<Wirisme> I'm alive
<killerpony7733> Eeeyup
<killerpony7733> Just got back from school and eating my chinese food lunch
<killerpony7733> :P
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck Pretty much... Btw don't quote me on that.

<TheRandomkid321> Yes I am merely posting humorous images.
<TheRandomkid321> Ad apparently i'm alone....
<TheRandomkid321> Hello? Ah I know what to do.
*TheRandomkid321 sprays self with rainbow flavouring
*DaringDerpy makes a few notes and continues watching
<moobull69> hello everypony
<moobull69> ooh good night phase4
<DaringDerpy> hello moobull69
<Phase4> XD
<Dumori> Phase4 sorry it's mi phone
*AdamTheDuck noms on TheRandomkid321
<moobull69> sorry I am a slow pony sometimes :P
<Phase4> Dumori, is ok ^_^
<AdamTheDuck> Hello moobull69
*Phase4 hugs Dumori and moobull69
<Dumori> I've been afk I'ma going out some time soon
*moobull69 hugs phase4 back
<Dumori> and torrmorw I'm moving to a new city
<Dumori> so I'm pretty AFK :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> Guys, the secret of Bonbon and her many voice http://derpy.me/UPNoP
*Dumori hugs Phase4
<Wirisme> wow Dumori, have fun with that.
<Phase4> i wonder how much valve is making of mann up mode
<Ninjazz> Good luck with that, Dumori. Hope it doesn't suck TOO much.
<Ninjazz> Phase4, not much I imagine. Boot camp is still a viable option.
<Phase4> its a completely optional mode, there is no game in mann up you cant play outside on a public server
<Ninjazz> And plus, isn't it just a /chance/ to get a trophy head?
<TheRandomkid321-> Hello?
<Ninjazz> Yello.
<TheRandomkid321> Is it workin?
<TheRandomkid321> Yeah now
<Phase4> Ninjazz, you are garuenteed to get one botkiller weapon per tour of duty completed
<Phase4> Ninjazz, theres a 1/50 chance you'll get a gold botkiller wep which is worth crazy huge right now
<Ninjazz> Phase4, oh. So wait... you get a bot killer WEAPON? You don't get an addon to put onto your own gun?
<Phase4> nope
<Ninjazz> That's kinda lame.
<TheRandomkid321> I'm gettng BF3 premium I am SO excited... Oh and I failed the milk challenge :< and I don't taste like rainbows anymore :<
<AdamTheDuck> Metro 2033 is fun :3
<killerpony7733> TheRandomkid321 yeah armoered kill is coming the 11th
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck god damn yes that game is soo good
<AdamTheDuck> Time to save Bourbon's sorry ass
<AdamTheDuck> Only up to chapter 3 :3
<TheRandomkid321> So just for clarifacation BF3 premium goves me acess to all the DLC for BF3?
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, pretty much.
<Ninjazz> Phase4, have you gotten any bot killer weaps, yet?
<Phase4> Ninjazz, nope
<Ninjazz> Awww. :<
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck what do you mean pretty much?
<Ninjazz> Also, Phase4, how much do the Mann Up tickets cost?
<Phase4> $1 each
<killerpony7733> TheRandomkid321 you get access to all DLC in the future and will get it earlier for example premium PC gets the 11th while non gets them a bit later in the month
<Phase4> you need 6 for a tour of duty
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, pretty much all the dlc, early access to them, a shitty box cutter knife which replaces your prefectly fine normal hunting knife, a crappy guide which you'll never read...
<Ninjazz> Feh. Still too expensive for my blood.
<AdamTheDuck> perfectly*
<Phase4> server's trolling me
<AdamTheDuck> that and EA's just stealing your dosh.
<Phase4> i join on map change every time
<TheRandomkid321> killerpony7733 so I get all DLC in the end right?
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck still premium is still more worth it. you pay alot less to get the DLC packs cause in total without buying premium it would cost more
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDukck Well I may as well blow s much money I have while I don't need to pay bills XD
<killerpony7733> TheRandomkid321 Yes you get all DLC that will come for BF3 and get early access
<Ninjazz> Erm... Not sure if I'd want to buy ALL the DLC.
<AdamTheDuck> That's the thing, you think you're getting a deal with buying all the DLC's because you think you're going to get them all anyway
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck Does this box cutter knife come with any extra damage?
<Ninjazz> Probably just get me Armoured Kill and be set for the rest of the game's life.
<killerpony7733> TheRandomkid321 nope cosmetic skin
<Ninjazz> Because the infantry combat in BF3, imo, kinda sucks.
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, nope, no differance other than looks
<Ninjazz> Much more of a vehicular combat game.
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck can you have your normal combat knife?
<Ninjazz> If they lowered the disabled threshhold of vehicles. -.-
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz yeah that's how i would see it. But i'll get all DLC anyway so if theres more air and vechicle maps i won't complain
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, Nope, stuck with yellow box cutter knife of uglyness
<TheRandomkid321> Nijazz I beg to differ but everyones entitled to their own opinion.
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, hopefully. I wouldn't want to waste my money on any other kind of map.
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck... Do the military eve use those knifes IRL? Does it only look like a box cutter knife?
<Ninjazz> Also there apparently is going to be a new play mode.
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Yeah the tank mode where you fight for areas?
<killerpony7733> Also AC-130 is gonna be interesting
<TheRandomkid321> Anyway don't try to talk me out of premium alright. My mind is set on traget.
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120605034349/battlefield/images/6/64/ACB-90_PNG.PNG
<AdamTheDuck> but in first person view it looks like one of those Stanley knives
<killerpony7733> TheRandomkid321 I'm not saying you should. I say if you got the money and want to save some cash do that
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, I guess so. All I've heard is that there is going to be a new play mode. AND YES, AC-130 is going to be very interesting. Finally a new target for Aircraft to target.
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck it doesnt look TAHT bad. Oh but in FPS it looks like a stanley knife? Aw well.
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz yeah but it's still a flying fortress as you would expect from the impressions so far
<TheRandomkid321> killerpony7733 I have 600 in my bank account so yeah.
<AdamTheDuck> I just want my Battlefield 2143 already...
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck hehe i never got to play that mode with the huge flying base
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, I wonder if it's going to be like the bombers from 1943 and just be a plane that gets in position to fire a few salvo's then leave, rather than be an actual flyable vehicle.
<killerpony7733> I heard it was god damn good
<AdamTheDuck> Titan mode... I miss it so much...
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://sliceofponylife.tumblr.com/post/31050598403/the-cakes-and-the-seven-grumpy-bons-sorry-that
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz it's set on a path that it follows that allows you to target most base points
<Ninjazz> Grrr. Not what I wanted to hear.
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz well it's most likely to prevent abuse
<killerpony7733> Imagine flying that to a enemy base and just raping it
<killerpony7733> Plus bad pilots crashing it
<Ninjazz> That where AA come into play.
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, THAT is good enough reason for me to accept it.
<Ninjazz> God, bad pilots. -.-
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz yep i know the feel especially with chopper pilots
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, ikr?... Like, I know you need to learn and gain some exp, but can you not crash us?
<Ninjazz> >.(\
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz eeyup
<killerpony7733> Also tv missiles <3
<Ninjazz> Too laggy to use TV missles properly. :c
<Ninjazz> Also, have some trailer music. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PhecAd_gLI
<killerpony7733> Umm i have a somewhat decent FPS on it. So if i do it right and my pilot can position me i CAN hit something
<Ninjazz> I just have a terrible connectoin to the server, so it takes like... 4 seconds for the missle to move at all, then it keeps heading in that direction and crashes into the ground.
<killerpony7733> That sucks
<Ninjazz> Tell me about it. =.= I was looking so foward to being able to attack tanks from miles away.
<Ninjazz> And maybe a lucky chopper or two.
<killerpony7733> Well techinally you can't snipe things that easily with a TV missile
<Ponies47> Good morning everypony
<killerpony7733> You need to be closer and have the right angle
<Ninjazz> Hello, Ponies47.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Ponies47
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bugs Bunny can be so sadistic when he wants to. http://youtu.be/Zy5f87-kI8c
<Ninjazz> So even then it's a pain in the ass.
<Ninjazz> And I say that right after CrimsonPhoenix says that.
<Ponies47> I wake up and my freakin cats are fighting agian. In my bedroom as well ;_;
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ponies47, go get the popcorn
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: Popcorn? Why would I just watch. Most of the time I break it up. >_><_<
<Ponies47> *?
<CrimsonPhoenix> But it's a catfight
<CrimsonPhoenix> you always bring popcorn in a catfight
<Ponies47> Oh now I get what your saying! :D
<Ninjazz> Meow.
*CrimsonPhoenix hiss
<killerpony7733> bark*?
<AdamTheDuck> Quack
<Ponies47> Moo
<Ninjazz> Waddle waddle.
<Ninjazz> ^that's what penguins do
<killerpony7733> I wonder what ponies do
<Wirisme> they talk :)
<Ponies47> ^
<killerpony7733> And then you killed the joke
<Wirisme> or squee
<Ponies47> No stream correct?
<killerpony7733> Damnit :<
<Wirisme> Nope no stream
<killerpony7733> Think i'll grind some more in tribes ascend
<Ninjazz> They neigh.

<Bronysith> RoboGerbil: you called shadow of the colossus dumb
<Bronysith> and you havent even played it
<Bronysith> before you judge it, play it and form your own opinion from it
<RoboGerbil> i said it sounded dumb, the premise. i mean c'mon how fun can killing 1 dude be through an entire level... sounds like a lame platformer
<AtalontheDeer> its incredeable how fast hasbro is on you tube to remove any view of a fursuit of the MLP Gang
<EleanorAwesome> Hmm?

<killerpony7733> Ninjazz yep if you upgrade it right and everything it it becomes that
<Ninjazz> YOU CAN'T STOP ME.
<RaveBrony> Its illegal to shower naked in Florida, hehe.
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, and it's also the weapon with the most attainable ammo.
<Ninjazz> So double bonus.

<Sonny> don't think it'll work tough
<Sonny> anyway any update on wrek's work :o?
<Sonny> I saw the Scootadooze picture yesterday :p
<Dken2021> Sonny something wrong with it?

<SafariMonkey> Sonny: I was wondering wether the HDD isn't the root of the problem, but wether something more inegral has broken
<SafariMonkey> *integral

<SuperBrony64> 11,02SpadeMagnes[School]: Yeah
<Dken2021> think she wasa producer, or writer
<Ninjazz> Wb.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What shows did she work on?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Powerpuff Girls was one
<Ninjazz> Lauren? She brought the coffee every morning.
<Ninjazz> Then as time went on. She became the brains of everything.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I know she was in the Iron Giant credits
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Best coffee delivery girl in the cartoon business.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Wait...seriously?
<Kammerjunk> Dun dun duun.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well damn thats quite a step up in the ladder...
<Ninjazz> Nah. I'm joking. She was hired to help on Power Puff Girls with Craig and that's when she started getting attention.
<ekips> In my three playthroughs, I always failed this dialogue...
*LadyCanary giggles.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh..welp
<LadyCanary> She's married to Craig McCracken. Adorable couple.
<VenHur> DUN DUN DUUUUN!
<Ninjazz> Oh so much.
<Ninjazz> So. Much. Dun.
<Kammerjunk> So what's this I hear about Powerpuff Girls 2013? So far, I've made it out to be a hoax.
<LadyCanary> ...I really hope they're not messing with me, Kammerjunk :I
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk, wait wait wat? What have you heard?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I liked Mojojo so much
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[School] wait, turns out that image is from a flash animation
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: I have heard that "Guess who's back?"
<Ninjazz> Back again?
<Ninjazz> Blossom's back? Tell a friend?
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: As in http://derpy.me/aPKkF
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I still find that in joke in Hurricane fluttershy hilarious
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk, ... this is unprecedented.
<Kammerjunk> And probably fake.
<Kammerjunk> Just wanted to know if anybody knew anything else.
<CCCP> Dat startrek Google logo
<OohShiny> I'm back
<Dken2021> huh, it's the 46th anniversary of star trek today
<Ninjazz> We'll see. Craig wanted PPG to end, though. But who knows. CN might be tired of their bad reviews and want something actually worth while. Atleast potentialy.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> God.. its been on for 46 years?
<Ninjazz> Because everyone knows, EVERY brony will watch PPG.
<MirrorImage> Ninjazz - and then some
<Ninjazz> Atleast that's a VERY high probabilty.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Did anyone else catch that in joke in the Hurricane fluttershy episode?
<Ninjazz> MirrorImage, indeed.
<Dken2021> what was it?
<Kristie> What joke?
<Eli> Ninjazz: i think i wont
<OohShiny> well, my google logo is my country's indepence day, I can't see it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Twilight said do I look like I speak squirrel
<CCCP> OohShiny aww what country?
<Ninjazz> Eli, Eh. I think it's fake too. But that's what I think.
<Dken2021> eh, thought it was just a coincidence
<Ninjazz> SpadeMagnes[School], oh that joke.
<OohShiny> CCCP: Brazil
<Kammerjunk> Gesundheit.
<CCCP> i see
<Ninjazz> Because Twilight=Bubbles. Bubble=Tara Strong. Tara Strong=Twilight.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Dats the joke
<Eli> Ninjazz: well, i won't watch it, even if it's real.
<CCCP> its not just a logo though its also a game
<Ninjazz> Eli, why's that?
<Bronysith> TO THOSE who have played shadow of the colossus, would you say WANDER is an antihero or a hero?
<Molly> Hi, everybody :)
<Jmo> 'ello Molly
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: don't forget Raven :)
<CCCP> hi Molly
<OohShiny> well Bubbles acts like Fluttershy and has twilight VA?
<Dken2021> ello Molly
<MadSurge> Back btw
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Shame SotC never got a sequel
<Eli> Ninjazz: just not intrested. besides, i can live with being called a brony, but a power puff boy?
<Ninjazz> Hey, Molly.
<Kammerjunk> This looks funny.
<Dken2021> Eli is that a thing?
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, oh yes. Evil beware. We have waffles.
<OohShiny> what's the problems with this guys
<MadSurge> But Power Puff Girls is a great cartoon Eli!
<Ninjazz> Eli, ... hey, if the show's good, I don't mind.
<Eli> Dken2021: i think i was joking :) but it might be :P
<OohShiny> Wrek: I was out
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: pissed off Raven is really scary D:
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Apperently from what I heard, New Super Mario Bros 2 is not selling well as other mario games
<CCCP> hi MadSurge
<Kammerjunk> They walk funny.
<MadSurge> Hey CCCP! :)
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, damn well "end of the world" scary.
<LadyCanary> Wreky u so silly.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: OHHH I C WUT U DID THERE :D
<Ninjazz> Lol.
<VenHur> Wrek, WHY U SO AWESOME AND SILLEH?!
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, :3c
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[School] well repeated music, graphics, and gameplay can only go so far
<MadSurge> OH SUSANNAH, don't you cry for me!
<Bronysith> Dken2021: but it is an awesome game
<Bronysith> Dken2021: and no it does not need a sequel
<OohShiny> Sneaky...
<mentallyeffedguy> hello
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I was surprised Nintendo seemed like they were running out of ideas
<Dken2021> hey mentallyeffedguy
<VenHur> Craaawling in the veeeent!
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Danish has butchered that song for me.
<Ninjazz> Hey, mentallyeffedguy.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also I am not going to get a WiiU this year
<CCCP> hai mentallyeffedguy :s
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Its way too expensive right now
<mentallyeffedguy> so Wrek is playing games again?
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: in italian it sounds pretty good D:
<VenHur> Wrek, the code is 1, 1, 1, 1, ....err...1!
<Dken2021> essentially, New Super Mario Bros. 2 is a metaphor of how rich shigeru is right now
<Kammerjunk> ^
<VenHur> ^^
<Eli> VenHur: it's A, A, A, A, A
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Werent some of the games Nintendo made based on Shigeru's life?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Like Pikmin or something?
<Ninjazz> Like Kirby?
<mentallyeffedguy> i wonder why deus ex is half third person and half first person
<Molly> Anybody hate clowns?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Me
<alexxm> Ninjazz so shigeru used to run around eating whatever crossed his path?
<mentallyeffedguy> and why does the people he is fighting have downsyndrom?
<MirrorImage> Vat's that sandvich? Kill them all?
<Dken2021> yea, zelda was based on his childhood, and wii fit was when he was doing exercises
<OohShiny> SANDWICH!
<Kammerjunk> Sandvich is good fuel for killing tiny cowards!
<VenHur> Well, spectifically Zelda, since it's based on Shigeru's early life of exploring his surroundings.
<RainbowDash90> SANDVICH!!!!!!!!!!!!
<MirrorImage> heh... we are such a bunch of nerds >_<
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Wasnt the chain chomp based on a dog he encountered?
<Ninjazz> alexxm, that and sucked real hard and laid eggs.
<Ninjazz> Also, btw, I have no idea who that is.
<Ninjazz> SANDVICH. Moist and delicious.
<RainbowDash90> lol
<Dken2021> ja SpadeMagnes[School]
<OohShiny> MirrorImage: I prefer to call myself a gamer
<RainbowDash90> :)
<Eli> Ninjazz: the sandvich is a lie!
<Kammerjunk> I prefer to call myself a geek.
<Kammerjunk> Rather than ner.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I doubt most people will be able to afford a WiiU this year
<Kammerjunk> nerd*
<Kammerjunk> It has better implications*
<LadyCanary> Twing~
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I heard it was gonna be around 300 bucks or so

<Sumica> 00,10hmmm Seasion 1 eh?

<Kammerjunk> Oh, lol.

<SpadeMagnes[School]> Do you know how sad it is when your in a class chatroom and the other 280 students or so act like immature kids?
<mentallyeffedguy> OohShiny: in the hour?!
<Kammerjunk> SpadeMagnes[School]: On a smaller scale, but essentially yes.
<OohShiny> mentallyeffedguy: month
<mentallyeffedguy> OohShiny: i was starting to winder
<mentallyeffedguy> wonder*
<SafariMonkey> MaxTheBrony: crysis 1 probably. Better gameplay and at least as good graphics
<OohShiny> SpadeMagnes[School]: they are talking about you being a brony?
<mentallyeffedguy> you cant live on 300 usd in the month
<MaxTheBrony> :) good to hear you chose the good one of them :)
<Eli> SpadeMagnes[School]: well... my classmates don't need a chatroom for that. and the teachers don't do anything a bout it, because their parents are rich
<Buytoast> GRAFIKS DUNT MAK A GAEM GUD
<mentallyeffedguy> we earn about 4000 USD a month
<Buytoast> CASUAL
<magmablock> dat Diamondback
<MaxTheBrony> Buytoast but crysis 1 has better gameplay overall.
<OohShiny> mentallyeffedguy: at least you can survive
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Middleschool sucks
<Kandarihu> Physics
<MaxTheBrony> than the crysis 2
<Ninjazz> First sign of my personal reaccuring apocolypse. First derp of the day. I'll brb after a restart.
<Kammerjunk> Eli: What a world where money owns the people.
<mentallyeffedguy> SpadeMagnes[School]: damn right
<Ninjazz> Kill everyone, Wrek.
<DaringDerpy> conveniently placed heavy weaponry means bossfight
<mentallyeffedguy> bye everyone, dinner waitss
<LadyCanary> That'll be easy.
<MaxTheBrony> bye mentallyeffedguy
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, mentallyeffedguy.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Makes it worse when the site i do school on is slow as fucking hell and its on IE
<SpadeMagnes[School]> WHY
<Kammerjunk> Boom.
<SafariMonkey> MaxTheBrony: I still play 1. 2, not played it since I realised I didn't like it.
<Eli> Kammerjunk: in a country where the banks controll all? what did you expect?
<MaxTheBrony> Wrek did you raise the graffics? if i remember correctly you had it on worse before :)?
<Kammerjunk> Eli: Nothing less.
<MaxTheBrony> SafariMonkey i love the mp on Crysis 1
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Is it just me or is Crysis going backwards in technology?
<MaxTheBrony> atleast in gameplay
<OohShiny> this crazy guys are worst than zombies
<MaxTheBrony> from fun open world to cod feeling missions.
<SafariMonkey> MaxTheBrony: so do I, unfortunately I have a certain iq imbalance.
*CCCP hugs the person below me
<killerpony7733> SpadeMagnes[School] yep it is
*CCCP hugs killerpony7733
*killerpony7733 hugs CCCP back
<killerpony7733> Hehe
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sequels do not work that way
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<OohShiny> SpadeMagnes[School]: I should tell you about Megaman
<MaxTheBrony> Dat dinner :)
<Kammerjunk> Dinner is nice.
<MaxTheBrony> yes it is .
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Rainbodah> Dinner killed stream?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I miss megaman so fucking much
<killerpony7733> SpadeMagnes[School] They downgraded it from huge open world to small linear and narrow and downgraded things to make it run for consoles
<Rainbodah> Oh
<LadyCanary> mmmm...foods.
<SafariMonkey> MaxTheBrony: IQ 145 overall logical and 59 processing speed. Hence I am not good at shooters, and prefer to take a sniping role
<MaxTheBrony> killerpony7733 exactly
<Eli> dinner sounds great actually. imma go eat. later
<Rainbodah> It didnt
<Dken2021|FireEmblem> me too SpadeMagnes[School]
<Kandarihu> I remember hearing it's infamously high system requirements. But it's on Steam, and according to the store page there, the system requirements don't seem all that unreasonable for a modern computer to have.
<OohShiny> SpadeMagnes[School]: Megaman 9 and 10 are 8-bit
<Kandarihu> It also uses a 3rd Party DRM, though. Securom
<MaxTheBrony> SafariMonkey i love sniping :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I could care less how a game looks as long as its fun to play
<Kammerjunk> I like pie.
<Kammerjunk> ^
<Eli> oh that song! i liked it by real big fish
<Kandarihu> And Crysis is published by EA.
<VenHur> I like pie too.
<OohShiny> SpadeMagnes[School]: I'm talking about downgrading technology
<BronyInstrumental> Dken2021|FireEmblem: which fire emblem are you playing?
<Buytoast> GRAFIKS ARE EVERYTHING
<Wirisme> Pie is liked by me
<OohShiny> SpadeMagnes[School]: and Megaman 9 and 10 are hard as hell
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I enjoy a challenge
<MaxTheBrony> Estethics are pretty much half of it .. not graffics :D
<OohShiny> SpadeMagnes[School]: and it's good to play
<MaxTheBrony> Theres an real awesome video explaining it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Alas I do not have wifi on my wii or Wii points
<MaxTheBrony> Whats it called now again D:
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Le sigh
<VenHur> Buytoast: Well, well, looks like SOMEONE's haven't seen the graphics of Pikmin 3 yet...
<Buytoast> like i give a shit
<OohShiny> It doesn't matter graphics for me
<VenHur> I'm just kidding.
<DaringDerpy> sounds like the best plan so far
<Buytoast> i'm getting it regardless
<Dken2021|FireEmblem> BronyInstrumental a translated SNES version of the first game
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Have fun blowing 300 bucks
<SafariMonkey> MaxTheBrony: I love sneaking in and suddenly revealing from the middle of the camp by destroying the huts they're in just for fun (I die and open my save)
<OohShiny> she's gonna cum!
<LadyCanary> Oh! I remember this one.
<MaxTheBrony> SafariMonkey same!
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<MaxTheBrony> i love it.
<DaringDerpy> run forrest!
<OohShiny> boss time
<Gold_Demona> I have returned
<MaxTheBrony> Welcome back Gold_Demona :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *cue Kid Icarus Uprising boss theme*
<SafariMonkey> MaxTheBrony: Great minds think alike
<Gold_Demona> I have finished washing my dishes, and you know what I found?
<MaxTheBrony> they sure do :)
<DaringDerpy> wb Gold_Demona
<SafariMonkey> SpadeMagnes[School]: is Kid Icarus good? I've seen the name but nothing more
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Uprising is fun for me
<SpadeMagnes[School]> People say it plays bad, but it really doesnt
<Gold_Demona> My kitchen sink! Can you believe it? I thought I lost it, but it was under the dishes the whole time. Who'da thunk it, huh?
<NavyShadow> Hello?
<Gold_Demona> Hi NavyShadow
<MaxTheBrony> I love this video, search for Penny arcade Graphics vs. Aesthetics... but do this after this stream , i dont mean to take viewers from wrek, its just an good video.
<ScottishUnicorn> The difference between Kid Icarus and the new game can throw some people off.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I always annoys me when people bitch about control issues in games they have when I never have them ever
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *It
<NavyShadow> is BronyState streaming the canterlot wedding encore tomorrow?
<Dken2021|FireEmblem> eh, don't think they stream repeats
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Skyward Sword for Example, a guy I know said the controls were horrible, I never had control issues
<Wirisme> controls are my favourite thing to blame for my shitting playing, along with cerma angles
<Wirisme> shitty*
<Wirisme> camera*
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<MaxTheBrony> Woah
<MaxTheBrony> that spawn
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Not trying to be ignorant but I wish people would quit picking at every tiny flaw to make a game look bad
<Buytoast> Skyward Swords controls were shitty
<SafariMonkey> MaxTheBrony: Don't you think they ruined crysis when they made it for consoles first?
<Buytoast> but there were some moments where they workded well
<MaxTheBrony> SafariMonkey it makes me sad :(
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I never had a fucking problem with SS' controls
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I dont know what everyone's deal is
<MaxTheBrony> I wished they would have learned and made crysis 3 like crysis 1 but no...
<SafariMonkey> MaxTheBrony: I was looking forward to that so much
<kirz|GW2> hehe, Wrek saved at a great point :3
<Buytoast> times where a stab would register as a swipe
<SafariMonkey> anyway gotta go everypony. Bye!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> That happened sometimes but I dealt with it
<Buytoast> times where you swung one way and it registered a differnt direction
<MaxTheBrony> Bye SafariMonkey :)
<Wirisme> farewell SafariMonkey
<Buytoast> i could deal with it too
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Never happened
<SafariMonkey> bye
<Buytoast> but not when it made it impossible to kill things
<Molly> Has anybody played The House 2?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I never had a issue killing onsters
<Buytoast> well go ahead and keep your rose colored lenses on then
<MaxTheBrony> what are you guys discussing?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im serious I never had issues that made me dislike the game
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<Buytoast> i like the game
<Buytoast> i dislike the controls
<Buytoast> stop putting words in my mouth sonny
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It wonked out a bit sometimes but it didnt get unbearbly bad
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Victory?
<MaxTheBrony> SpadeMagnes[School] your in school?
<MaxTheBrony> O.o

<SpadeMagnes[School]> 19 days till I can buy MoP
<MaxTheBrony> good for you :)
<MadSurge> alexxm: oh heavens, let's hope not!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Welp
<alexxm> MadSurge well if uwe boll is far away from it it could be good
<MadSurge> alexxm: point taken :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Man I can't wait for MoP, shit will be cash
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *so
<Barbetos|AtWork> Blow up the place
<alexxm> MadSurge besides the games have a strong enough story that it could work
<MaxTheBrony> My personal opinion of MoP is that it is meeh
<DaringDerpy> why can't you link to the AI?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> woah
<RaveBrony> MoP? *shivers*
<killerpony7733> This is where i liked the game alot though the ability to choose endings in a prequel was a bit silly. The endings are done soooo well
<BronyInstrumental> MoP?
<killerpony7733> however*
<SpadeMagnes[School]> RaveBrony: <_<
<RaveBrony> I hate what MoP has done :'(
<Gold_Demona> Dat live action footage.

<Barbetos|AtWork> Waldo throwing a molotov
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: busy cleaning up?
<RaveBrony> Mists of Pandaria
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Yet...no one relizes people requested the Pandarens for a long while
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Nope. Crocheting. Can't type and crochet at the same time. Need to grow more hands for that. :P
<Lil_B> well, New super mario Bros U does look like a bit better than New Super Mario bros Wii 2 -.- but I still don't think I'll get a Mario Game for the WiiU XD
<AJIsAwesome> Hello, Bronystate! How are you all today? :)
<MaxTheBrony> I would only buy WiiU for the zombie game at the moment :)
<RaveBrony> I dont care about the Pandarens :o I welcomed MoP!....until i saw the changes...
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<Lil_B> hello tehre AJIsAwesome :)
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo AJIcAwesome

<Barbetos|AtWork> I wonder if they will do another ARG with this game
<CCCP> Kammerjunk if i gave you one for free would you like it?
<Barbetos|AtWork> or series.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And if anyone bother to READ THE LORE they would know Pandarens have been around for a long time
<killerpony7733> Wrek Still love how they did the endings. Though i cannot due to canon of the series story like how they did it
<Lil_B> hi LadyCanary :)
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: Hi! :)
<Gold_Demona> Thank you for streaming it and commentating, Wrek. =D
*LadyCanary claps for Wreky ^_^

<RaveBrony> SpadeMagnes[School]: I know they have been! But i dont care about Pandas. I dont like the changes made to the classes. I dont know about other classes, but Shamans sure got racked in the nuts! x_x

<CCCP> Wrek how about Super Man 64?
<MaxTheBrony> dat sleep :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> RaveBrony: I know... I was venting about the people who think MoP is ripping off Kungfu Panda
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony yeah despite how silly it is to add different endings to a prequel game. They damn as hell did the endings well though
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Bunch of dipshits...
<Fuzzles|LOL> SpadeMagnes[School] ping?
<Lil_B> CCCP aww :( I would say try to not use the PC or TV or any other device... but I know from myself that the urge to stay here is bigger than the Pain the fever is giving me XD
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: MoP?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Mists of Pandaria
<Ninjazz> You know that Warcraft 3 had pandas in game before Kunfu Panda, right?
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Never heard of it.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> New WoW Expansion
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: Eeyup.
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, okay.
<Fuzzles|LOL> Ninjazz DUH!

<Kammerjunk> Was a joke before that.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Ninjazz: I do, some people dont
<CCCP> Lil_B yeah lol... i might be AFK for a while soon
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: I guess it's the Warcraft version of the cow level.
<Ninjazz> Good. Cause that's kinda BS.
<MaxTheBrony> Ninjazz i know that :)
<Fuzzles|LOL> Pandas are chinese, chinese people know kung fu... ITS COMMON TO COMBINE THE TWO!
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk, lol. Kinda sadening.
<Lil_B> CCCP no prop, your health is top priority :)
<MaxTheBrony> Still
<MaxTheBrony> guys
<SpadeMagnes[School]> People need to learn to freaking read the lore
<MaxTheBrony> it cant be helped that people get confused by pandas after seing both..
<SpadeMagnes[School]> No its not
<CCCP|AFK> :3
<MaxTheBrony> But some people dont give a crap about the lore.
<Kammerjunk> But you just played Invisible War!
<MaxTheBrony> ...
<CCCP|AFK> bbl
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I knew from the get go they werent related
<Fuzzles|LOL> MaxTheBrony there is nothing to be confused. People should just stop assuming xD
<MaxTheBrony> I dont give a rats ass about the lore of wow.
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The lore is the fucking story
<Kammerjunk> oh my
<pony_1286> i honestly dont care about the pandas, i just want the class changes
<MaxTheBrony> wow had a story?

<SpadeMagnes[School]> A fuck ton actualy
<Fuzzles|LOL> pony_1286 but... I'm a panda ;A;
<MaxTheBrony> I didnt get much enveloped in it.
<MaxTheBrony> they didnt present it good enough
<MaxTheBrony> ...
<MaxTheBrony> Imo
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well I respect that
*Ninjazz senses the essence of a hug and hugs the precense of Lil_B back.
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony i still prefer the non MMO warcraft
<MaxTheBrony> I love Wc3!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You're being reasonable about ti so I respect your opinion
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I'm just a gigantic WoW and Lore nerd..
<Fuzzles|LOL> I havent seen Nittany in a while. Is he ok?
<Ninjazz> I hope so.
<RaveBrony> Oh god. The "Pony sisters/brothers club" ep of Pound Puppies was just. It was too great! :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> School started, I blame that.
<RaveBrony> *just on
<pony_1286> ponies should be the new race in wow
<Gold_Demona> I wonder if Wrek likes this game:P
<Fuzzles|LOL> pony_1286 xD
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah and i can see why you are looking forward to MoP if iyou are , but for those who arent read up on the lore its hard to look forward too
<AJIsAwesome> RaveBrony: Pony sisters?
<Kammerjunk> Oh, Kyle's probably fine.
<Lil_B> ... brb, need to update my browser
<pony_1286> im sure they could add an equestria continent in there somewhere
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Pandarens were requested to be a race way back in the BC days
<SpadeMagnes[School]> No one remembers that though
<Kammerjunk> I still want that god-damned two-headed ogre playable character.
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah and they prob worked hard for these 4 years to make the world beleiveble.
<MaxTheBrony> 4 ( or more*
<pony_1286> and why the HELL arnt TUSKGARS A PLAYABLE RACE?
<pony_1286> I WANNA BE, A FREAKING TUSKGAR!!!
<Kammerjunk> I want to be the guy.
<RaveBrony> Cuz they smell like fish ;P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But man o man I looove my motorcycle
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Kammerjunk> I can say one good thing about MoP: I don't have to farm TLPD twice.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> TLPD?
<RaveBrony> Its a shame im now going to stop playing WoW.... I havent even had my Ashes of Al'ar that long :'(
<MaxTheBrony> Imo i think gw2 dont need Mounts .... BUT it would be epic if it had some :)
<Kammerjunk> SpadeMagnes[School]: Time-Lost Proto Drake. Took me a few months getting it once.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The name fits
<Kammerjunk> It does.
<Kammerjunk> God-damned rare spawns of rare spawns.
<Gold_Demona> Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'
<RaveBrony> I still dont have TLPD :[
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I spent ages looking for that stone drake in Deepholm
<RaveBrony> Same
<MaxTheBrony> O.o So many people in this game...
<MaxTheBrony> its incredible
<Gold_Demona> It's legit enough to be funny. :D
<RaveBrony> I wanted the Drake of the North Wind.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have the eastwind
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It clips badly
<MaxTheBrony> electro jazz?
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Half of my character's torso clips into the body
<MaxTheBrony> ah
<MaxTheBrony> its this.
*AJIsAwesome snaps to the beat
<Ninjazz> Some on say Jazz?
<MaxTheBrony> what is this genre?
<MaxTheBrony> :)
*LadyCanary jazz hands
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I still say the difficulty spike from Ragnaros and Deathwing is fucking massive
*Ninjazz jazz hoofs along with LadyCanary.
<Buytoast> shit, i don't even remember what mount i have
<pony_1286> anybody seen people using potion of illusion to turn into giant snakes in their main city?
<Wirisme> jazz hooves :D
<MaxTheBrony> I hade a horseu
<Buytoast> deathwing is easy shit
<Buytoast> a shame really
<RaveBrony> Needs more spirit fingers in here!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Ragnaros is way harder
<killerpony7733> Dat Bob Page
<Buytoast> ragnaros was harder
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Itbugs me
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The staff quest is a bitch to do
<Molly> Anypony played "The House 2"?
<MaxTheBrony> Dr.reed O.o
<RaveBrony> Firelands was Amazing!! DS was a shame....
<MaxTheBrony> Oh there she is.
<Buytoast> Dragon Soul was shit
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Fight is hard enough... I dont need a knock back effect added
<Buytoast> the only interesting part was the back fight, and even that felt underwhelming
<pony_1286> i remember back in wrath you would be lucky to even get to the second to last boss in icc
<MaxTheBrony> Who is Bob :P
<MaxTheBrony> ?
<LadyCanary> Duuuuuun
<MaxTheBrony> Ahhh
<MaxTheBrony> Allright
<Gold_Demona> Bob the Builder?

<RaveBrony> Buytoast: Thats the only fight i like. Keeps you in the game, constantly watching every aspect of the fight.
<LadyCanary> Thank YOU Wrek ^_^
<AJIsAwesome> THanks, Wrek. :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have this weird talent that allows me to immitate voices pretty much perfectly
<Ninjazz> Thank you, Wrek.
<RaveBrony> I wanted to fight Deathwing! not his damn little spawns...
<Aryd> Thats a pretty epic talent
<Lil_B> and I'm back ... I have no video currently, but judging by the voice I heard Wrek is playing a Quantum Conundrum?
<RaveBrony> I think its over
<Lil_B> or at eleast I heard John De Lance?
<Malavolent> Good evening, everybrony.
<RaveBrony> Hey, Malavolent :P
<Lil_B> hi there Malavolent :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have no idea how to raise my mana count in MoP
<Malavolent> Ohai Lil_B, just the person I wanted to see :)
<RaveBrony> But anyway, Ragnaros was some nice nostalgia ( since ive been a player since Vanilla :))
<AJIsAwesome> Malavolent: Hi! :)
<Lil_B> Malavolent errrr... thanks XD
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He actually has legs this time Rave
<RaveBrony> Ah the good old days when it took 4+ hours to get a raid together :)
<Meanwhile> Allo everyone.
<Bronysith> hi Meanwhile
<Ninjazz> Hey, Meanwhile.
<RaveBrony> When nobody bitched and left after 3 wipes
<RaveBrony> Hiya, Meanwhile!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> RaveBrony: Or one wipe <.<
<RaveBrony> SpadeMagnes[School]: Ah, true. 3 was a little generous
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Hello! :)
<Meanwhile> One does not simply stick around after 3 wipes.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I like that Heroic raids sometimes add new phases to fights
<Bronysith> HAPPY BIRTHDAY LED ZEPPELIN
<pony_1286> TOO MANY DRUIDS!!!
<Buytoast> why would you leave after three wipes?
<Meanwhile> Where's my combat res? We used it on the shaman. Whyyyyyyyyyy.
<Eli> pony_1286: there can't be too many druids.
<Buytoast> i did that i'd be outta my guild quicker than rain in thed esert
<Meanwhile> Tbh I think this is more of a PuG discussion
<Buytoast> bah
<Meanwhile> Since leaving in the middle of a guild raid is for only the most lowly of douchebags.

<RaveBrony> My guild wasnt bad..... but they Constantly gave away my raid spot =_=
<Meanwhile> With the exception of that one guy whose dog caught fire.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Ragnaros actually gets up and moves in Heroic firelands
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Does anyone know how mana is raised in MoP
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Intelegence no longer does that
<SpadeMagnes[School]> LFR is utter shit
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My raid scedual is shot to hell thanks to school
