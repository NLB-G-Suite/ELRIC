<cachi01> Lightning-Quill: this is better
<Lightning-Quill> Oh well then I will
<cachi01> u know who deserves love????
<timstr117> i know but why cant someone show a vid of mlp
<cachi01> pinkie guy
<Lunar_Brony> cachi01 it has a more technological feel to it. Also, I used it in a dance competition at school. Won first place, hands down
<Feasttalon> Why don't we watch Ouran High School Host Club?
<otakon> timstr117: bc if we did that all the time it would not be the treat it is.
<cachi01> Lunar_Brony: FUCK YEAH DAT WIN /)
<otakon> Feasttalon: Bishi fest? Hell, why not Hetalia in that case?
<timstr117> thats messed up
<owlicious> yay
<Lunar_Brony> cachi01 /)
<Ponies47> timstr117: Yeah. It's bronystate not ponystate
<Inkie_Pie> Yeah!
<Feasttalon> Meh
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: i may have been lying
<cachi01> Lunar_Brony: but i prefer this version cause of the feeling its an old arcade beat

<cachi01> pinkie guy his music is AWESOME
<owlicious> quick! We must get into the /media/TARDIS!
<otakon> timstr117: not really, think of it this way. If your favorite food was served EVERY DAY for every meal wouldn't you eventually tire of it? Same concept, we keep ponies to a minimum so we don't get tired of them.
<cachi01> he doesnt get the love he deserves
<Caramel> 2,14 it's hardly even a minimum...
<otakon> Caramel: what's a minimum then?
<Caramel> 2,14 a minimum would be like, only showing it during BMN
<samthehedgehog14> i agree with ponies47
<otakon> well, it's not minimum if we don't count PMV's and G1-G3.5 showings
<Feasttalon> Double the Pinkie!
<owlicious> don't forget tea parties
<superretroworld> i love this song, it makes me proud of becoming a brony

<superretroworld> otakon: mayans?
<Ponies47> cachi01: Nope. Fluttershy is the only pony.

<otakon> Saturn: WHAT DOES IT MEAN!?
<Feasttalon> otakon: There's it's not the end its just the end of a cycle. The last time it happened the only important thing to happen was: The Spanish reinforce their garrison in Jamaica
<pony_9944> hmmm.... coltcuddler

<Feasttalon> Was it me?

<owlicious> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Shamroc> he is pissing val off
<icybeauti> Oh......-.-
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: no, someone just complained about the content of the stream
<Beefchief> I want new ponies
<pony_9944> who ping?
<Lightning-Quill> I'm the quiet one so not me
<otakon> and thus we get NO STREAM
<cachi01> Tom: you dont say
<Meanwhile> He's gonna have a bad time.
<Barbetos> Beefchief never, they hate us now.
<Beefchief> :<
<Ponies47> Thanks Tom. Your always there for our updates :)
<Lunar_Brony> otakon why the buck would someone complain
<Yahooz> Hey guys guess what
<icybeauti> Beefchief: I know the feel bro.

<otakon> /)-_-) GODDAMMIT
<cachi01> Yahooz: tacos?
<Yahooz> Val doesnt stream
<Yahooz> got it?
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: bc they didn't like the music or some such
<Yahooz> therefore
<Beefchief> I want Discord back :<
<Yahooz> dont complain
<Lunar_Brony> otakon -_(\
<Yahooz> and you get a stream
<cachi01> otakon: timstr117 complained
<icybeauti> Beefchief: Mabe he'll do a luna styled comeback.
<owlicious> but it's caramel. She wouldn't let anypony down
<Feasttalon> Does asking for something count as complaining?
<Lightning-Quill> Why do you think I'm silent all the time :D
<timstr117> yeh like an hour ago
<owlicious> or give anypony up, or hurt anypony
<owlicious> or make them cry
<cachi01> owlicious: you mean EGOOOORAPTOR?
<Barbetos> The complainer in no way shape or form reflects the overall feelings of the stream from the general community.
<Yahooz> owlicious: who is also Val. so no
<Shamroc> oh my god
<timstr117> and i wasnt the only one
<Shamroc> MY EARS
<pony_9944> Wah!!!!!!
<Shamroc> WHY MUST 10 YEARS OLDS BE GIVEN MICS
<Inkie_Pie> ?
<Beefchief> I prefer a Star Trek TNG "Tapestry" episode but with Discord and Fluttershy
<Meanwhile> So what's streaming? I'm still on Diablo.
<Feasttalon> I'm just confused now
<Cypresswolf> O_O I just walked in, who's complaining? Is this timberwolf gonna have to bite somepony?
<cachi01> well confusion is fake
<VenHur96> Hey guys, sorry for my absence. Was watching some Youtube videos...
<icybeauti> I jsut want John to come back. He has one of the coolest voices ever.
<cachi01> confusion doesnt exist
<owlicious> it does. Clearly we need a separate chat room where we can introduce newponies to the real channel.
<cachi01> U DONT EXIST!
<Shamroc> swear to god...the other team has 4 engis..and they arnt capping
<Inkie_Pie> WHy must thier be 30 sec ads?
<Feasttalon> Touche
<Biglaw|TF2> Well, playing TF2 on a netbook isn't the most ideal expeience
<pony_9944> hmmm.... Cake?
<Biglaw|TF2> experience*
<timstr117> because that is how they make money
<owlicious> because mips is cruel.
<cachi01> dat lie pony_9944
<icybeauti> You think they'll haver a "Make a pony and we'll put it on TV" contest?
<timstr117> and that is why u dontt haft to pay
<Feasttalon> Everything in this world isn't free, that's why.
<cachi01> icybeauti: maaaaaaaaaybe
<Cypresswolf> Finished watching Anthology 2 - crashed in the last 20 minutes before
<icybeauti> cachi01: Now that would be a hell of a contest. Especially with all the artist and all.
<Lightning-Quill> Stop posting things that would correspond with an Image I start daydreaming about it
<otakon> Cypresswolf: the last 20 aren't the best though
<Inkie_Pie> :'(
<cachi01> icybeauti: or a pay about 300000 dollars and get your oc in the series
<icybeauti> cachi01: Or that :D
<Feasttalon> LOL
<Cypresswolf> otakon: yeah, it does wind down quite a bit
<Lunar_Brony> cachi01 Shut up and take my bits!
<icybeauti> My mom agreed to take me to bronycon again next year. -victory screech-
<Yahooz> Meanwhile: Val /was/ streaming, but people complained and now they have nothing
<kirzstryfe> 8,6nothing atm, someone was bitching it was but wasn't ponies, so Val stopped
<Biglaw|TF2> icybeauti lucky you :)

<cachi01> my mom agreeed to take me to E3 and bronymexicon next year YAY
<Yahooz> oh here we go
<Lunar_Brony> ominous sounding music . . .
<Feasttalon> I'm going to BronyCon next year even if I have to walk there
<VenHur96> timestr117: Speaking of making money, I don't think Capcom is listening to thier decicated fans anymore, ever since they cancelled Megaman Legends 3, they keeps trowing DLCs and others at your faces! This makes me not want to buy another Capcom game ever again...
<cachi01> maybe i will be able to see HL3
<icybeauti> Biglaw|TF2: Thank god I live so close.
<owlicious> no, not the G3.6

<Biglaw|TF2> tf2 sounds hilarious, the sounds repeat, in a funny fashion
<Yahooz> like a bawss
<AttackPony> hen3ry: "Hands of one, hands of all"
<owlicious> Feasttalon: it's more like a giant squid with tentacles for a beard
<hen3ry> Now let's all just get down to the dungeon, and try and cheer up. After all, worse things happen at sea.
<Feasttalon> God

<Petrified_Discord> icybeauti: They DID say that Discord ruled Equeestria in a state of chaos and unhappiness. They must have been referring to gen 3 and 3.5 :O

<Shamroc> thats the point
<cachi01> Cypresswolf: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?

<Dken2021> Big_Macintosh_1992 Band of Brothers
<Lunar_Brony> Saturn not quite. I can't drive, I have no job, and i have no money
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Band of Brothers
<Ponies47> superretroworld: It's to early for bed. I just have leave
<Big_Macintosh_1992> thanks Dken2021
<owlicious> Saturn: Aliens invaded, and they made a cruddy movie about it.
<hen3ry> Saturn: it's the anniversary of the signing of the declaration of independence
<YahoozEmail> ohai great grandpa
<User0> Saturn: people play with fireworks because america got it's freedom
<icybeauti> Val deserves to be treated like the almighty mod she/he is.
<MahBoi777> hey Big_Macintosh_1992!
<Saturn> 08,01Lunar_Brony: neither can/do i on all counts too
<YahoozEmail> ohai great great grandpa
<superretroworld> oh :D
<Meanwhile> A shi-lackin.
<Feasttalon> It's the day America declared independence from Britain, also a name of a really good alien movie
<AttackPony> Saturn: It's the day that the 13 Colonies won against the British in the Revolutionary War
<Big_Macintosh_1992> how ya doin MahBoi777
<VenHur96> ...Bronystate should shows the Independence Day movie for Independence Day...
<YahoozEmail> ohai great great great grandpa
<hen3ry> Saturn: except it's not quite the right day, and the actual independence didn't come till we actually won the war, so...
<Yahooz> VenHur96: thats been done

<Saturn> 08,01AttackPony: so wait... the British were Cylons?
<YahoozEmail> ohai great great great great... buck it.
<VenHur96> Yahooz: Oh.

<Big_Macintosh_1992> pretty good MahBoi777... but had to run in and out of a grocery store in the 90 degree heat for 6.5 hours today...
*owlicious assaults fluttercry with cake
<AttackPony> Saturn: No....they were human. War was held because the American Colonies were tired of the British taxing everything
<Meanwhile> otakon: always got a goddamn plan.
<Kencolt> Saturn: Independence Day-- every 4th of July-- commemorates the day that the official signing of the Declatarion of Independence . The US counts is's birth as an independent nation-- as opposed to being a colony of Great Britain-- as starting on July 4, 1776.
<Saturn> 08,01Lunar_Brony: that said, 2 of the most important members of our committee are 16
<Mutterguy|SLP> Saturn my country is governed by a toaster. your argument is invalid

<Biglaw> Aaaand, I shall never play TF2 again
<AttackPony> Kencolt: We didn't really go in the intricate stuff in middle and high school...
<Big_Macintosh_1992> MahBoi777: i agree.
<Saturn> 08,01Lunar_Brony: i know how, start a con! :D
<Meanwhile> icybeauti: Happy half birthday for last month then.
<icybeauti> Meanwhile: Thank you :)
<Big_Macintosh_1992> MahBoi777: humidity doesn't help either
<Kencolt> Saturn: Quite. Usually there are lots of fireworks, often backyard grilling, I usually allow myself something more... strong than I usually drink as a toast.
<operatorpony> shaving with ice water....
<MahBoi777> Big_Macintosh_1992: not at all
<otakon> damn, now THAT takes balls
<fluttercry> 05,15This show is so freaking good
<Xaiden> did this just start?
<otakon> shaving with FREEZING WATER
<icybeauti> Wonder what they do in britian for our independence day....
<Dken2021> Xaiden yup
<YahoozEmail> so dis one time, a friend of mine told me not to read Cupcakes, so I didn't. I got curious, so I went on Omegle question mode and asked.
<otakon> Xaiden: eeyup, ep ...5 I think
<owlicious> Forget BCC, I'll start my own con, with hookers and pony rides.
<Feasttalon> I don't think they hav one
<Xaiden> Dken2021: THANK GOD I LOVE THIS EPISODE
<cachi01> hookers!
<hen3ry> icybeauti: Don't know for sure, but I think they celebrate getting rid of us backwards, cultureless Yanks
<otakon> YahoozEmail: dear God man why?
<Meanwhile> icybeauti: We do all the stuff we usually do every other regular day.
<Mutterguy> It wouldn't be a issue if the was a Duchy of New Brunswick
<Yahooz> shnow
<YahoozEmail> dis is what ensued: http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/3170/cupcakesq.jpg
<otakon> NO
<owlicious> hah
<icybeauti> Yeah.....I went on omegele once....Not pretty.
<Kencolt> Saturn: At any rate, after what the colonists condisered abuse from Parliament and George III (And it damn well was, too!) we cut loose, sent him a coipy of the Declaration, and well, he wasn't happy about it. This the Revolutionary War.
<Feasttalon> I am in charge of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw!!
<icybeauti> Then we fought them, won, then had a party.
<VenHur96> YahoozEmail: And that's how I never used Omegele!
<Yahooz> oh dayum
<hen3ry> Kencolt: except the war was underway for over a year by that point.
<Mutterguy> In fairness, he was mad and his son wasn't a great help
<operatorpony> Thats rough
<Feasttalon> icebeauti: A political party. Ba Du Boom
<Yahooz> your lucky i cant ghost you YahoozEmail
<YahoozEmail> derp
<YahoozEmail> I'm just making fun of you.
<Biglaw> For some reason, there was a stop light flashing like four times a second :p
<Yahooz> my name does not have any correlation with yahoo.com nor yahoo email
<Kencolt> Saturn: Eventually, because (a) we had some DAMN clever military leaders and (b) The British armies were trying to fight exactly as tey had for over a century where we had learned less... traditional methods of combat (You couldn't get a Redcoat to understand that no, we weren't coming out of the forests when we can shoot you from safety), we atually won.
<Biglaw> o_o
<Yahooz> get that through your head
<icybeauti> I was on for 5 seconds....Ugh I hate that place...It's a bunch of professer oaks.
<Chains> o_o
<owlicious> You can't ignore their girths
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Bronystate doing anything for the 4th?
<fluttercry> 05,15Big_Macintosh_1992 you're looking at it
<Mutterguy> oh don't forget military of the French
<fluttercry> 05,15Band of Brothers awww yeah
<Big_Macintosh_1992> fluttercry: oh
<icybeauti> Oh, military stuff.....AWESOME!!!!
<Kencolt> Mutterguy: True, France helped. Mostly to piss off Britain.
<operatorpony> morphine!
<hen3ry> Well, that's not the whole story either. We had some instances of real dumb luck. Like being the beneficiaries of the one French naval victory over the British within a century
<operatorpony> nom
<Chains> Morphine :D
<Feasttalon> Morphine!!
<cachi01> drugs!
<icybeauti> Then the brits came back in 1812.
<fluttercry> 05,15for unrelated reasons
<Yahooz> Two medics, one hole... oh mai
<Saturn> 08,01Kencolt: nice
<superretroworld> is it just me or are there new mods here?
<Kencolt> Saturn: But yes... it's a big deal to us. Kind of the National Birthday.
<hen3ry> icybeauti: to be fair... we attacked first in 1812.
<Feasttalon> Two medics, one hole, Uber Chain!
<operatorpony> LOL STDs
<Crono_brony> DAMN YOU MIPS.TV!, i cannot see the stream! (probably due to weak connection.)
<icybeauti> And that's how america was made. hen3ry I learned this last year, I forgot most of it.
<Saturn> 08,01Kencolt: that's awesome!
<kirzstryfe> 8,6there haven't been new mods in about 5 months
<fluttercry> 05,15superretroworld no you're just seeing some os us for the first time
<Saturn> 08,01i'll need to be in america for that, some time
<Chains> Feasttalon: You rang?
<Dken2021> superretroworld nah, you probably haven't seen them yet
<Feasttalon> Medics chain, tf2 reference
<icybeauti> It would be cool to mod...But I have no webcam equipment.
<superretroworld> oh
<hen3ry> icybeauti: we started 1812 trying to get Canada, while the UK was distracted by Napoleon. And we by all rights should have been reconquered.
<Kencolt> saturn Washington DC has one HELL of a fireworks display, if I remember correctly.
<Shizuka> 13are people startin
<owlicious> later, britain dumped thousands of gallons of oil in america's oceans
<Mutterguy> Our is based around a piece of paper that wasn't upheld until a century later
<icybeauti> Kencolt: See the one in NYC
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: They're slags if they are.
<operatorpony> dat shrapnel
<owlicious> hen3ry: and we burned down the white house
<Saturn> 08,01superretroworld: i'm the last mod to have been promoted, so if you've seen me before, you've probably seen the othe rmods
<Chains> OH BUCK
<owlicious> then they repainted it white
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> best time to see all mods, is during Brony movie nite
<otakon> Shizuka: they already did dear, you missed the GREAT STREAM BLACKOUT OF JULY 2, 2012.
<Feasttalon> You didn't burn it down, a tornado put it out
<hen3ry> owlicious: its ok, we built a new one. with blackjack. and hookers!
<icybeauti> Then we had the civil wa- Wait, britian wasn't there for that.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6being a mod does not automatically mean you get to stream
<otakon> Shizuka: courtesy of Caramel bc someone was being a dick.
<Shamroc> Shizuka: tf2 teim?
<Kencolt> hen3ry: Wasn't QUITE that simple. There was also the small matter of British navy pressing our sailors, forcing Americans to join the British Navy.
<AttackPony> otakon: It's July 3, 2012
<Feasttalon> *somepony
<Dken2021> besides, being a mod means you have to watch over rooms as well
<Yahooz> you gotta work for that stream
<icybeauti> Only certains stream, or the ones who have the time and equipment?
<ponibas> stop startin!

<Kencolt> Dken2021: I do-- not that I was there, but I did study it. WWI was an excercise in NAtional Stupidity-- old simmering feuds in Europe-- which led to some of the bloodiest fighting, and set the stage for WWII, an excercise in insanity and inhumanity.
<owlicious> [SWAG]Haku: the closest thing i can think of is Radiant Historia, but that's only one war
<RainBowJack> is Sumica streaming?
<Phase4> 00,02lolwut

<otakon> SOmeone said something akin to this "Humanity is abhorrent in the fact that the old use the young to kill each other with" or some such
<Feasttalon> Tis just a scratch
<RainBowJack> this is the most Dramatic part of the war and scariest
<Meanwhile> Blood on trousers? Rarity is disappoint.

<fluttercry> 05,15Spears is still alive
<Death> Lunar_Brony: THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PYRO FUCKING MANIA
<SolairePony89> fluttercry: It's about war, what'd you except?

<Meanwhile> Been playing alone.
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: it's WW2
<Shamroc> always want to be the 2nd game to come out....cause you'll cause more hype
<SolairePony89> fluttercry: Bullshit! If anyone should die, it's him!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> btw spanish voice for female monk voice sounds good but still does not fit
<Ponies47> fluttercry: Doesn't really help that I'm kind of depressed right now :/
<Stallion_of_War> Hey! It's now officially Independance Day on the East Coast!
<PinkiePC|Messenger> ...

<otakon> I bet he killed a US officer
<PinkiePC|Messenger> I have breaking news...
<MasterBoss43> HEADSHOOT!!! :D
<Sumica> 00,10Finaly got his luger
<otakon> oh enope, he finally got his Luger
<fluttercry> 05,15SolairePony89 Yes he did. But you can't keep every prisoner. Plus nobody knows if it was him or not.
<otakon> CHEKOV'S GUN IN ALL GODDAMN SENSE OF THE TERM
<Iron_Edge> Woot woot! Dat luger :3
<Meanwhile> Like a sack o' potaters.
<Sumica> 00,10then he became trixie
<otakon> hiya Sumica
<TheHoodyNinja> Hey guys whats up
<PinkiePC|Messenger> otakon: This was a good place, until the ANti Brony Brotherhood attacked..
<SolairePony89> fluttercry: We saw him kill them though. And he gunned them down with no rhyme or reasons. I'm sorry, but you really can't justify that
<PinkiePC|Messenger> otakon: The ABB is real.
<Ponies47> Hey TheHoodyNinja! Nothing much :P
<otakon> PinkiePC|Messenger: wait what? who's ABB?
<Iron_Edge> Sumica: Except ya' know. He's a show off thats packin heat.

<MahBoi777> hey TheHoodyNinja!
<SolairePony89> fluttercry: Erm, no
<SpiderJack> I'm gonna go,'night,everypony!
<SolairePony89> Night SpiderJack
<fluttercry> 05,15Also there is justification. You can't let the prisoners go, but you can't use resources on them.
<Meanwhile> Inb4 abuse of artistic license.
<TheHoodyNinja> Hi MahBoi777 and Ponies47
<fluttercry> 05,15What else do you do?
<Kencolt> SolairePony89: This is based on real facts- these incidents did occurr. And War isn't always rational. In fact, it very rarely is.
<Ponies47> SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK
<PinkiePC|Messenger> otakon: The AntiBronyBrotherhood. If I was a mod and I was streaming, I would be streaming how to deal with parasprites, because the antibronybrotherhood is trying to kill our love and tolerance code, and kill off the millions of bronies.
<Ninjazz> Hey there, TheHoodyNinja.
<Shamroc> oh shit half-life fic
<TheHoodyNinja> HI Ninjazz
<otakon> PinkiePC|Messenger: buck em
<fluttercry> 05,15whoops
<Barbetos> Huh. Googling ABB actually brings up a Steam and Facebook group.
<Ponies47> PinkiePC|Messenger: I could really use your help right now dealing with haters :(
<otakon> oh look, KARMA
<adasdad> TheHoodyNinja: you're a ninja, you're a hoody ninja
<Ninjazz> Ninjas are awesome.
<TheHoodyNinja> adasdad: :|
<otakon> he's gonna lose that leg
<SolairePony89> Kencolt: You can't except me to like the person who killed prisoners for no reason other than because he wanted to
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nevar. http://derpy.me/rDGhQ
<Meanwhile> All those updates and I'm not reading any of them.
<Midnight_Fyre> Question: Has anyone here (from the US) ordered a shirt from welovefine?
<otakon> GUYS
<PinkiePC|Messenger> otakon: We need to warn everyone... they even have their own poster.
<Kencolt> SolairePony89: We don't know his motives-- and again, that was what was reported. Weither is actually happened in history is uncertain.
<otakon> the ABB has a Steam group
<fluttercry> 05,15SolairePony89 it's not that he wanted to. and like I said, nobody knows if he actually did it. But if he did, there was nothing else that could have been done with them. Fact is, the guy is a great leader
<Ponies47> otakon: What?
<PinkiePC|Messenger> Ponies47: Don't worry, my friend.
<otakon> I think we shold ALL join
<Barbetos> ^^^
<Barbetos> I was just about to say that
<AttackPony> Midnight_Fyre: No. Why?
<otakon> WHO'S WITH ME!?
<Ponies47> PinkiePC|Messenger: Can I have a hug? I really need one :(
<PinkiePC|Messenger> otakon: Join what.
<Meanwhile> otakon: Join what?
<fluttercry> 05,15;__;
<otakon> PinkiePC|Messenger: the ABB
<PinkiePC|Messenger> Ponies47: I will give you a hug and a guide
<Midnight_Fyre> AttackPony: I want to know how much shipping is for a shirt in the US
<fluttercry> 05,15ded
<otakon> the Anti Brony Brotherhood Steam group
*RainBowJack hugs Ponies47
<otakon> the fools got it public
<Meanwhile> otakon: That's silly.
*kirzstryfe chases the shiny bouncy ball
<otakon> Meanwhile: no, it's goddamn brilliant
<PinkiePC|Messenger> otakon: ... Wait, they have their own FUCKING.POSTER.
<Shamroc> .what shiny ball?
<otakon> PinkiePC|Messenger: they also have a public Steam group
<Meanwhile> otakon: what'd be brilliant is if you had the sense to ignore those kind of folks like oyu're meant to.
*kirzstryfe chases the shiny bouncy ball
<fluttercry> 05,15I haven't been on EqD in months
<AttackPony> Midnight_Fyre: I forgot how much it was but I think it's between 4 and 10 dollars if you live inthe US
<Barbetos> Anti Brony Brigrade/Brotherhood. Get all your brony friends to join and ask what the deal is yo, or you know... post ponies. But that is not really love and tolerance
<BroKnee> Whats the name of this show?
<Kencolt> I cann't agree. Joining such a board would be trolling them. And trolling them would be wrong. And anyhow, they won't getnearly as big as EQD anyhow.
<BroKnee> Also, herro everypony ^-^
<Shamroc> i just look for music i like and comics
<Meanwhile> I have EQD up all day erryday.
<otakon> hiya BroKnee
<Midnight_Fyre> AttackPony: Not too bad I guess. About what I expected
<otakon> BroKnee: Band of Brothers
<Ninjazz> Hello there, BroKnee.
<otakon> it would serve them right tbh
<fluttercry> 05,15Besides, Love and Tolerance IS our anti troll technique.
<TheHoodyNinja> Should i continue playing computer? Or stay here with you guys?
<AttackPony> Midnight_Fyre: Expensive if you don't have the money:D
<Spriggals> oh look I come back and another ep :)
<fluttercry> 05,15That's why love and tolerance even exists
<AttackPony> Hi BroKnee
<TheHoodyNinja> I gotta be honest i feel unloved here
<otakon> fluttercry: so, join the group and play TF2 with them?
<MahBoi777> hey BroKnee
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: Silly idea. I believe in ignorance.
<Midnight_Fyre> AttackPony: True. Good thing I just started a new job
<fluttercry> 05,15You "kill em with kindness" as they say
<otakon> well, looks like some bronies already joined
*Ponies47 Hugs RainBowJack back
<AttackPony> Midnight_Fyre: Sweet. I've been looking for a job sine I moved in with my sis almost 2 years ago. No luck yet.
<fluttercry> 05,15Lt. Dyke is a terrible leader
<TheHoodyNinja> Meanwhile: Ignorance may be bliss, but everybody else is unhappy with you
<Spriggals> Yes
<otakon> check this out: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/anti-brony-brotherhood
<Spriggals> Just keep watching
<Kencolt> Besides, wghat they have is a lame facebook page... and most posts are random.

<Meanwhile> TheHoodyNinja: But what about the pancakes?
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: Thanks
<Kencolt> otakon: So,... the only comments are an agrument about which is best pony. I'd say that fails.
<TheHoodyNinja> Meanwhile: someone stole them...
<otakon> Kencolt: eeyup... they won't go far.
*TheHoodyNinja sings Dykes praises

*Ninjazz assures TheHoodyNinja that this is all just a dream anyway
<MahBoi777> just a dream??:O
<Midnight_Fyre> So a few days ago I bought those glittering Twilight and Rainbow Dash blindbags. Then I suddenly remembered how much I hate that glittery stuff that gets everywhere
<Spriggals> Mmmm canadian bacon.
<TheHoodyNinja> Does that mean your all figments of my imagination?
<Ninjazz> eeeeyope.
<SolairePony89> Ahh, bacon

<fluttercry> 05,15What WAS bronycon?
<Ninjazz> A HUGE DREAM.
<Barbetos> I did not go... =(
<TheHoodyNinja> fluttercry: apparently i have very expansive dreams
<Kencolt> Youreally shouldn't have picked the red pill.
<Barbetos> I used imagination to go!
<Barbetos> =D
<Midnight_Fyre> I also bought a Twilight brushable and have come to the conclusion that I hate pony hair
<Meanwhile> That's sad. :I
<Barbetos> And streams.
<Saturn> 08,01i missed all the bronycon stuff
<Saturn> 08,01i was away at the weekend :(
<TheHoodyNinja> why is e3 and bronycon so close?
<SolairePony89> Barbetos: But mostly dreams I take it? :P
<TheHoodyNinja> couldnt go to either
<SolairePony89> TheHoodyNinja: Palatte cleanser
<TheHoodyNinja> I thought i had the choice
<Ninjazz> Saturn, there was a fire.
<TheHoodyNinja> but then i had to go to dads
<Barbetos> SolairePony89 man I WISH to dream about ponies. I am seldom that lucky
<Kencolt> Ninjazz: Not so much a fire as a melt.
<Midnight_Fyre> The roof, the roof, the roof was on fire
<Barbetos> I get random dreams about trains and relatives that I don't actually have
<TheHoodyNinja> I have had 3 dreams that involve ponies
<fluttercry> 05,15Barbetos. Do you like trains?
<Ninjazz> Kencolt, that's what I heard atleast. I wasn't there or even was watching the stream at the time. :P
<SolairePony89> Barbetos: I'm never that lucky. If I could dream of ponies I'd actually want to dream
<TheHoodyNinja> and i dont remember any of them
<Kencolt> Ninjazz: Pics on EQD, somewhere.
<Barbetos> fluttercry Nah. I don't particularly feel anything about trains.

<CrimsonPhoenix> also hello everyone
<Ninjazz> Hey there, CrimsonPhoenix.
<Kandarihu> I did a Steam Group list for anti brony. The largest anti-brony group is Anti-Brony Federation of The World (ABFW) with 90 members. The search did turn up a large number of brony groups whose descriptions mention antibronies. Four of them are larger than the largest antibrony group.
<MahBoi777> hey CrimsonPhoenix!
<[SWAG]Haku> Haku returns!
<adasdad> dat helmet
<Barbetos> wb
<adasdad> so many dings

<Barbetos> Chat suddenly got quiet again.
<[SWAG]Haku> indeed
<Kandarihu> Okay. Searching for anti pony turned up a 252 member group called Anti-Pony Association ((APA)).

*TheHoodyNinja kicks a tumbleweed through chat
<Barbetos> Kandarihu its kind of silly that there would be so many groups over something that, currently, seems to only be a passing fad.
*Ninjazz gets hit in the face with a tumblweed
<Ninjazz> ow.
*TheHoodyNinja puts a bandaid on Ninjazz's face
<[SWAG]Haku> Haku likes that guy

*MahBoi777 glomps Sylandest
<[SWAG]Haku> which one?
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: most unexpected...but not unpleasant! :D
<MahBoi777> Sylandest! :D
<[SWAG]Haku> Original or Korra?
<Sylandest> howdy, MahBoi777!
<TheHoodyNinja> WindWhistler: Idk, its like american anime
<Lunar_Brony> WindWhistler Last Airbender or Korra?
<WindWhistler> Original.
<Lunar_Brony> afk
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Korra x Aang
<Om> Sylandest: Hello again.
<Shizuka> 13http://xkcd.com/1077/
<Shizuka> 13done
<Sylandest> howdy, Om! :)
<Ninjazz> Sylandest *muffle voice* what's that supposed to mean?
<TheHoodyNinja> SeaponiesofLiverpool: theyre the same person...
<Dovah> WindWhistler: TLA? love dat show
<WindWhistler> I'm amazed that it's an AMERICAN anime and it's still amazing.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> now they aren't
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: you have a very comfy head? :$
<WindWhistler> actually, the American part alone is pretty amazing.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> no they aren't
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Aang x Korra
<WindWhistler> And Korra seems to be doing well too.
<[SWAG]Haku> actually, they shorta are the same
<WindWhistler> So....would that be selfcest?
<TheHoodyNinja> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Aang was reincarnated into Korra
<[SWAG]Haku> Thats why its called having "Past Lives"
<TheHoodyNinja> His spirit lives within her
<Shamroc> so thats what Shizu has been doing
<Ninjazz> Sylandest, *muffled voice* Ah. Okay. *resumes hugging*
<Sylandest> :D
<WindWhistler> Wait, does the next Avatar appear after the previous one dies?
<[SWAG]Haku> Just as every Avatar lived inside Aang
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> so... different people
<TheHoodyNinja> WindWhistler: yeah Aangs dead
<[SWAG]Haku> WindWhistler Yes
<TheHoodyNinja> The only person from the original series is Katara
<Kencolt> Sort of like the Dalai Lama.
<Shizuka> 13ah midnight before the 4th of july and someone's setting off fireworks
<TheHoodyNinja> everyone else dead
<WindWhistler> Lemme rephrase that
<fluttercry> 05,15So when you say Aang x Korra, you really mean Aang x Aang.
<WindWhistler> Is the new Avatar born as the former one dies?
<fluttercry> 05,15Also, I hate that show
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> no I mean Aang x Korra
<TheHoodyNinja> WindWhistler: yeah
<kirzstryfe> 8,6he's industrious, he got a box
*fluttercry hides behind flame shield

*WindWhistler explodes
<Lightning-Quill> I don't want to see legend of Korra my loyalties lie with aang
<pony_9944> fus ro dah!!!!!!!!!!
<Ninjazz> fluttercry, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! One does not simply hate Avatar.
<TheHoodyNinja> im sorry fluttercry you mean Korra?
<Xaiden> How much longer is this?
*Dovah implodes twice
<Shamroc> Shizuka: farily certain i've been hearing fireworks all day.....either than or they are gunshots
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> 10 hours
*WindWhistler explodes, and then explodes again
<fluttercry> 05,15I simply hated it. Does this mean I can walk into Mordor?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14same here
<Xaiden> -_-
<fluttercry> 05,15AND find Gondor?
<Barbetos> enope
<Ninjazz> O__O
<TheHoodyNinja> fluttercry: The Last Airbender? or the legend of Korra?
<Dovah> It means you. Will. Die.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> but you can walk into Rodrom
<WindWhistler> fluttercry: Surely you must have SOME reason to dislike the show?
<TheHoodyNinja> ANSWER ME!
<Ninjazz> You be asking for the impossible, fluttercry! D:
<pony95901> im going to label hating The Last Airbender as a disease
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> there's nothing that says you can't walk into Rodrom
<fluttercry> 05,15Both. I watched a few episodes of both and it just did not interest me
<WindWhistler> I can understand disliking it...but hating it seems a little out there without a good reason.
<[SWAG]Haku> haters gonna hate
<WindWhistler> fluttercry: Isn't it a bit harsh to say you hate it then?
<TheHoodyNinja> fluttercry: Which episodes? Not all are epic
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Rodrom - (mordor backwards)
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> there's nothing that says you can't walk into (mordor backwards)
<fluttercry> 05,15Not harsh to me
<WindWhistler> Ah, I see.
<Shamroc> welp i just yanked the power cord out of my moniter
<Dovah> fluttercry: ... no u cant judge cuz u watch a couple of shitty episodes.
<TheHoodyNinja> That means your a bad person
<WindWhistler> Hate and dislike pretty much mean the same thing to you then, fluttercry
<WindWhistler> amirite?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I'm sorry, but what do you expect them to do watch the whole series?
<fluttercry> 05,15Well I did. It failed to make a good first impression so I have no need to continue down that path
<kirzstryfe> 8,6does it really matter if someone doesn't really care for something you may like?
<fluttercry> 05,15Now back to BoB
<TheHoodyNinja> kirzstryfe: no but EVERYONE likes TLA

<Canadian_Brony> I come from a country that has never started a war.
*MahBoi777 steps off
<Kencolt> POssibly six.
<Ninjazz> Even better.
<Canadian_Brony> and I'm proud of that
<[SWAG]Haku> Canadien_Brony But also one where you finish one
<Ninjazz> Hey there, Canadian_Brony. And you participated in few. That means nothing.
<[SWAG]Haku> Canadiens taught Americans to fight in the revolution
<IshBestPony> Canadian_Brony what about that one time when you bombed the Baldwins starting a bloody war between Canada and the US?
<AttackPony> gaa chat derpage
<MahBoi777> lol
<[SWAG]Haku> Canada and Us are the best of friends
<MahBoi777> Canada is floating over us O_O

<[SWAG]Haku> OH CANADA!!
<IshBestPony> remember, Blame Canada, Blame Canada
<TheHoodyNinja> Ah Canada, Americas hat
<Canadian_Brony> Ninjazz IshBestPony Canada has never STARTED a war. I would drop a fact about the US and war, but I'm feeling serene
<TheHoodyNinja> Keeping our head warm
<MahBoi777> YAY Canada
<IshBestPony> Canadian_Brony you obviously didn't get the reference did you?
<Canadian_Brony> IshBestPony My serenety has dissapeared. The US has started 4 wars alone.
<Ninjazz> Canadian_Brony, I never said anything about the US but I was merely saying that NOT STARTING a war but PARTICIPATING in one means nothing.
<Canadian_Brony> don't say I didn't warn you
<IshBestPony> Canadian_Brony so you didn't get the reference?
<IshBestPony> From the South Park Movie
<TheHoodyNinja> slow truck
<Meanwhile> Dat banter.
<Canadian_Brony> IshBestPony I don't watch South Park
<Ponies47> brb

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> you guys attacked the Seneca
<Canadian_Brony> fluttercry it counts cuz Americans started and Americans finished it
<TheHoodyNinja> that was good
<fluttercry> 05,15Band of Brothers never fails to entertain
<Ponies47> back
<IshBestPony> I wonder if Canadian_Brony can tell the difference between a joke and a serious?
<Kencolt> fluttercry: Ah. The US did NOT start the Veitnam War, rather we came to aid of South Vietnam in an existing war. (And we negotiated a peace, that when we left, the North Vietnamese broke almost instantly.)
<Meanwhile> I dunno what this conversation is about but it looks stupid.

<Yahooz> so a stream within a stream?
<Caramel> 2,14 and I keep saying ChaosX like a moron
<CrimsonPhoenix> but it is inspired by a custom map from an RTS game
<Caramel> 2,14 Chaox* is TSM's Ranged AD

<Kencolt> LoL ISN'T from Warcraft, tho.
<Barbetos> I am going to bed now. Thanks for the stream btw.
*IshBestPony tried swordfish today for teh first tiem
<Ninjazz> fluttercry, in a nut shell, you get one hero unit and must assist masses of friendly waves to destroy the "core" of the enemy base.
<Canadian_Brony> live-streaming a live-stream
<AttackPony> night, Barbetos
<Canadian_Brony> seems legit
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's why it falls on its own category
<CrimsonPhoenix> MOBA
<pony95901> a mod in warcraft introduced the moba genre
<HatchetRyda> nite Barbetos
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: The original DOTA was built from Warcraft modding. It's like tower defense minion farming hero battles.
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Barbetos
<Shamroc> IshBestPony: anything like lobster or crab?
<AttackPony> Canadian_Brony: We need to go deeper.
<pony_9944> hawaii is the 50th state
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Barbetos. Take care.
<fluttercry> 05,15That sounds really complicated
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: But you only control your champion.
<IshBestPony> Shamroc it tasted like any old other fish
<IshBestPony> Shamroc nothin unique
<Lightning-Quill> Hey that's a good song
<Shamroc> fluttercry: fairly simple...kill stuff..dont die....break the other teams base
<Canadian_Brony> AttackPony right. I'll see if I can get a desktop recorder working and post this all over Youtube
<CriticKitten> That sounds like if you took Pikmin to an extreme.
<pony95901> Shamroc: and cs!
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I think I've got myself something to do while waiting for season 3
<CrimsonPhoenix> WATCH ALL OF STARTREK NEXT GENERATION
<Canadian_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix and that is?
<Ninjazz> fluttercry, you also get cool abilities that work well against other heroes but can also get you creamed against others.
<Shamroc> pony95901...which falls under KILL STUFF
<Canadian_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix buck yeah! I'm in!
<pony95901> Shamroc: yeah i guess...
<Lightning-Quill> Give me reasons why I should plat WOW

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Tank/paladin ?
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: question are we talking about a WOW 5 man dungeon party?
<IshBestPony> Canadian_Brony still can't recognize dem jokes can ya eh?
<kirzstryfe> played d&d once, dwarf paladin, DM immediately dropped me down a hole that was deeper than I was tall, without rope
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: I'm just thinking generically.
<Shamroc> kirzstryfe: ahahaha
<Canadian_Brony> IshBestPony are you Canadian?
<IshBestPony> Canadian_Brony no eh
<Shizuka> 13[00:32] [@Shizuka] what are we watching
<Meanwhile> League of Legends.
<Canadian_Brony> IshBestPony that would explain why you are overusing "Eh?"
<Shamroc> Shizuka: were watching ^
<kirzstryfe> he was a little pissed that he thought I was going out with the girl he liked (she had no interest in him) and that I was stealing his former best friend
<IshBestPony> Eh
<Ghosties> 04DEGRASSI
<Ghosties> 04IS THE BEST CANADIAN SHOW
<Ghosties> 04OKAY
<Ghosties> 04DEGRASSI HIGH, 1990'S
<Ninjazz> OKAY
<Canadian_Brony> I would give you an entire essay about "Eh?" If i wanted to
<Meanwhile> You never play LoL Shizuka
<Mutterguy> In memory all those who died in the Alien invaison...
<Meanwhile> ?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> btw this is the only pic i has of val http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/ValthePony.jpg
<Shizuka> 13nope
<Shizuka> 13to me
<Shamroc> kirzstryfe: then why the fuu were you playing a game that he could easly kill you in?
<Shizuka> 13it is one giant clusterbuck
<Canadian_Brony> Ghosties never heard of it
<Canadian_Brony> TBH
<Ghosties> 04:I
<kirzstryfe> the guy and the girl were both good friends of mine, so we were all playing
<Meanwhile> I dunno why but I thought it might be your kinda game.
<Ghosties> 04Well, no big deal
<Shamroc> lol poor val...angry at everything
<IshBestPony> Canadian_Brony you have five hours to do a 500 word essay on it, chop chop eh
<kirzstryfe> and Trixie, that's his basic character model
<Ponies47> Ohai Canadian_Brony :0
<Ponies47> :)
<Ghosties> 04My Geology teacher last semester was Canadian; one of the coolest professors I've ever met
<Shamroc> and kirz went poof
<Mutterguy> in what year was ID4 supposed to have occured?
<Shizuka> 13i don't like having to split my focus so much
<Shizuka> 13this looks like micromanagement hell to me
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ghosties, what about Undergrads?
<Canadian_Brony> IshBestPony I have one typed out about Canadain stereotypes
<Meanwhile> It's less complicated than it looks.
<Shizuka> 13it's why i never play engineer in tf2... you have to focus intensely on every single pixel on the screen because they are all spies out to kill you
<Shamroc> Shizuka: you are onlu controlling the big ones
<Meanwhile> That's very true.
<Canadian_Brony> IshBestPony I also have a book called "How To Be A Canadian *even if you are already one"
<Ghosties> 04What about Undergrads?
<Shamroc> Shizuka: woulndt that make your sentry and glove a spy?
<Shizuka> 13just not fun to have to juggle that much information
<Canadian_Brony> what's an Undergrad?
<Meanwhile> Well, champions are all built into damage/tank/support/ranged/melee sort of sets and your job is to use them effectively, that means using the abilities and spending gold on items properly.
<Canadian_Brony> . . . did my chat derp?
<Canadian_Brony> 1
<Canadian_Brony> 2
<Shizuka> 13see... in tf2.. you can still be useful with only the stock weapons..

<Canadian_Brony> 4
<PinkiePieCopy> This music
<brony_swan> sup bros, hows it goin?
<Meanwhile> It's not really the same kind of item setup.
<Canadian_Brony> there we go
<Lightning-Quill> you have a nice house
<Canadian_Brony> chat derp
<Meanwhile> In LoL it's all passive +50 deathray or whatever.
<HatchetRyda> hi brony_swan
<Meanwhile> There are some on-use items but for the most they're stat sticks.
<Mutterguy> Canadian_Brony we saw you fine. you just didn't give us time to respond
<Ghosties> 04HAHA
<Shamroc> yeah the items only give bonus's...or such...only a few items that have useses
<Ghosties> 04Canadian_Brony got kicked XD
<Canadian_Brony> Mutterguy really? Huh.
<Ghosties> 04For simply checking to see if his chat was functioning properly XD
<Flaron> OMG LoL
<Mutterguy> Is funny though
<Canadian_Brony> Ghosties so what? I reseted the chat
<Canadian_Brony> Imma hipster
<Flaron> who is he running?
<Canadian_Brony> somewhat
<Meanwhile> Kill mobs, get xp, level up, unlock/upgrade skills. Each champion only has 4 skills including an ultimate and they're all fairly easy to understand.
<PinkiePieCopy> Welp
<Ghosties> 04You a hipster? Where's your fedora?
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: dont forget the passive and summoner spells
<PinkiePieCopy> Ghosties: Fedoras are too mainstream.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> except lee sin
<pony_9944> :[dark court in session!!! any pony over 18 say YAY!! if not say Neigh!!!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> he is an ass
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> :p
<PinkiePieCopy> Yayneigh.
<PinkiePieCopy> Problem?
<Shamroc> he and kick your ass into the nexus and WIN
<Meanwhile> Indeed. One ability has a passive affect until used during which time the passive takes a while to return.
<pony_9944> YAY!!!
<Ghosties> 04Whatcha getting at, pony_9944
<AttackPony> yay
<Sumica> 00,10My fedora is on my Scout.
<Mutterguy> yeah! Hipsters wear propeller hats now
<Canadian_Brony> Ghosties somewhat. I listen to Simple Plan, watch MLP: FiM, and don't have my jeans far down enough for everyone to see my boxers
<Shizuka> 13rain rain~<333
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai Rain
<Meanwhile> And summoner spells are pretty much the same except not unique for champions, rather you pick the ones you want from a list at the start of the match.
<Ninjazz> Sumica, stylin'.
<Meanwhile> Allo Rain.
<PinkiePieCopy> Guys
<PinkiePieCopy> I have bad news
<PinkiePieCopy> MLP is now mainstream
<Rain> hello everybody

<Canadian_Brony> PinkiePieCopy no, it's MANESTREAM
<Meanwhile> I'd get into runes and flim flam but it'd be pointless because I fail at LoL anyway.

<Shamroc> Meanwhile: yeah i do that too

<sub06905> Shizuka: you would die with no power :D, i would also :$
<Ponies47> Shizuka: I would die without my power O_O
<Shizuka> 13there is that too....
<Canadian_Brony> Polydunami Y U give me your weather? All it is here is rain, rain, and more rain
<Shizuka> 13part of my brain dies when there is no power...
<Shizuka> 13i don't really talk to anyone in meatspace... even with my parents it's rare...
<Lightning-Quill> That reminds me of the time an icestorm nocked out the power for 2 weeks that was not fun
<Polydunami> I'm going to see the forecast for my area.
<Shizuka> 13my dogs hear me talk more..
<sub06905> just imagine a worldwide power outage for 3 days :o

<Polydunami> What the hell?
<Ponies47> AttackPony: I just shut off my computer and log off. I use to put my computer into stand by and keep me logged in as Ponies47|Sleep but then I found putting my computer in stand by doesn't lock it. So when I started it up no password screen which is a big problem because my step brother is always trying to get on it for no reason -_-
<Canadian_Brony> Lightning-Quill depends. I dreampt I met a Pegasister in one of my dreams. The next day, I met a girl in school I actually liked. Go figure.
<AttackPony> Ponies47: That's smart.
<Ponies47> AttackPony: Yeah. I hate my step brother and my step sisters -_-
<Lightning-Quill> I got desktopponies 2.4 and 1.5
<Lightning-Quill> 1.4 not 2.4

<Canadian_Brony> Rain I understand how you would see that
<Polydunami> Indeed
<pony_9944> LOL sooo true
<Rain> I prefer to be called a Brony
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: My step brother and step sisters have the same purpose -_-
<Rain> being called pegasister feels like I am being excluded from something >_>
<Canadian_Brony> xMLPxREACTORx http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix7vrluEm4E
<Polydunami> I don't really care about being called a brony myself.
<Ponies47> Rain: I gotta agree. I thi nk everypony male or female should just be called brony
<Ponies47> *think
<Lightning-Quill> why don't we just stick to brony as being unisex meaning used for both genders
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh hey a new Brony
<Rain> thats what I use it as
<pony_9944> note: wat is the female = of a brony?
<CrimsonPhoenix> My name's CrimsonPhoenix

<AttackPony> xMLPxREACTORx: My name is AttackPony or AttackWithHugs
<Lightning-Quill> So you hate MLP
<sub06905> so would my friend be considered a brony if he likes the characters and fan made music, but he dosent watch the show?
<Polydunami> Hate is useless to me.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Of course I hate you guys and especially you. I hate you the most.
<Canadian_Brony> pony_9944 unoficailly "Pegasister". Some just prefer brony. Tomato tomato (both prononciations are hard to do in text)

<hen3ry> she's 20 months old, and she already has a favorite pony.
<Polydurian> I'm afraid so, Alchemist: no other blood type can have your blood.
<hen3ry> unfortunately, it's a G3 pony lol
<Shizuka> 13except AB+?
<MadSurge> hen3ry: :3c doesn't matter she's too young
<Polydurian> I DID say no OTHER blood type... didn't I? :S
<MadSurge> Ohei Shizuka!
<Shizuka> 13never learned how the + and - fit into the can receive..
<hen3ry> + people can take + or - blood.
<Shizuka> 13we only learned the base letters.. O is universal donor, AB universal recipient
<hen3ry> - people can only take - blood
<pony_9944> needles!!!!!!!!!??
<Alchemist> PolyDurian: the red blood cells, I think they could still use my plasma and any other type can receive plasma from my blood.
<Polydurian> That's quite true, Shizuka.
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/HOe1aVRjb_4
<CrimsonPhoenix> Great song
*Ghosties does not know his bloodtype
<pony_9944> hate them blood sucks!!!!!!!
<Shizuka> 13and if + can take + or -, shouldn't someone who's AB+ be able to take AB+? :3c
<Canadian_Brony> from what I know, there's A+, A-, B+, B-, AB, and O
<Shizuka> 13i think mine is A+.. i forget
<hen3ry> Shizuka: you can _always_ take the exact same blood as you already have...
<Canadian_Brony> if I'm wrong, don't blame me
<hen3ry> So yes, AB+ can take AB+
<Shizuka> 13saw my birth certificate like exactly once..
<hen3ry> AB+ can take any blood, it's the universal acceptor.
<Polydurian> O- can be given to anyone, making it the universal donor.
*Polydurian is O- :3
<harley2947> Anybody on?
<pony_9944> hmm.. whats the rarest blood type anyways?
<TrixieBaconMuffin> just checked , im O - , CcD.ee , Kell neg. whatever all that means!
<xMLPxREACTORx> a +
<xMLPxREACTORx> i think
<Alchemist> pony_9944: AB apparently :D
<Shamroc> wooo blood types!
<Canadian_Brony> I'm IB positive. I be positive ain't nobody stikin' no needle in me!
<hen3ry> Rarest is AB-
<hen3ry> second rarest is B-
<pony_9944> im just an O
<hen3ry> Most common are A+ and O+
<xMLPxREACTORx> i though o was the rarest
<Polydurian> JUST an O, pony_9944?
<Shizuka> 13i'm just a O.. yes i'm only a O
<pony_9944> positive
<hen3ry> Nope. O- isn't even that rare, it's just in very very high demand.
<Shizuka> 13and i'm sitting here on... can't think of a rhyme this late
<hen3ry> O+ however is the most common
<Ghosties> 04I'm straight up G, yo!
<hen3ry> http://bloodcenter.stanford.edu/about_blood/blood_types.html
<Ghosties> 04Hardcore, fo lyfe!
<Shizuka> 13ogg lock
<pony_9944> im just easy blood.... wahhhh!!!!
<Canadian_Brony> welcome back Ghosties
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/0kFT4iEE3k8
<Canadian_Brony> y u leave?
<Polydurian> True, O- is not so rare, although I know only about seven percent of the Canadian population have it.
<MadSurge> Hullo Ghosties!
<hen3ry> In the US, it's 6.6% according to the source I just linked
<pony_9944> hay Ghosties
<Canadian_Brony> I'm IB positive. I be positive ain't nobody stikin' no needle in me!
<Ghosties> 04I leave because the streets be calling me, dawg
<Shamroc> peace out
<Alchemist> no problem with needles if they go into my arms/legs/buttocks etc. I hate it when they try to stick a needle in my mouth.
<Polydurian> And yeah, since O- is the universal donor, it can be used in emergencies like births (ESPECIALLY premature births) or car accidents when the blood type can't be checked right away.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02HXC
<Canadian_Brony> hi SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai ^-^
<sub06905> dat SuperBrony64
<Alchemist> There are instances though when the docs have to use type specific blood as far as i know.
<Polydurian> Hey SuperBrony64, B+.
<pony_9944> well i gotta go... 21 hrs on ta net is really not gud 4 ma mind metink
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You b dawg dat shit is for real mofo
<pony_9944> ja ne
<Canadian_Brony> Google is still celebrating the "111th Anniversary of the Worlds Longest Covered Bridge"
<hen3ry> whey they have to match exact types, that's usually for more invasive things like transplants. For simple blood transfusion, you can always give O-negative whenever there's any doubt
<Canadian_Brony> g'night pony_9944
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What are we all doing? :3
<Polydurian> Google celebrates EVERYTHING. Maybe it's run by Pinkie Pie?
<Shizuka> 13discussing blood
<hen3ry> discussing blood. Now, 1873 Romanian, that was a fine vintage...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Mine is red.
<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 discussing blood transfusiongs
<Canadian_Brony> I'm IB positive. I be positive ain't nobody stikin' no needle in me!
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/l2X_D3ixlFI
<Canadian_Brony> I just used the same quote 3 times here . . .
<CrimsonPhoenix> GIVE ME YOUR FRIENDCHIPS
<hen3ry> yes you did
<Polydurian> I dunno, SuperBrony64. When they took blood out of me, it was more of a darkish purple.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
<hen3ry> mine has a slight green tint to it I think. Either that, or I've been staring at the screen too long
<Ghosties> 04He's a dark alien overlord. Kill him now.
<hen3ry> dat nick.
<sub06905> lol
<SuperBrony64> 11,02That's because your hemoglobin lacks oxygen ^.^
<FlutterCum> I wonder if Spike has a scrotum or if his testicles are stored inside his body.
<Canadian_Brony> Polydurian that blood was deoxygenated
<Canadian_Brony> AKA, they took it from your vein
<Polydurian> No, it's because it's the blood from my VEIN.
<Polydurian> Yeah
<Ghosties> 04Man, you guys
<Canadian_Brony> *a vein
<Ghosties> 04Jesus
<Ponies47> Even with my dad having a much better computer it derps from time to time. Back :)

*Canadian_Brony is confuzzled
<CrimsonPhoenix> He could've research really
<hen3ry> inappropriate user name, don't worry bout it
<Polydurian> Don't worry about it, Canadian_Brony.
<Polydurian> :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Canadian_Brony, don't ask
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I think he misspelled FlutterChum
<Ghosties> 04If I let him stay he would have gone on and on
<hen3ry> yes, that was it I'm sure.
<hen3ry> Chum.
<KiwiBoi777> indeed SuperBrony64
<KiwiBoi777> Lol
<hen3ry> as in, chum the waters for sharks
<Alchemist> Ghosties: now you are just being intolerant :D
<Ponies47> Ghosties: So true.

*Canadian_Brony is flusterred
<cher3ry> because buck you spiderman does what he wants.
<Polydurian> Luna Eclipsed, probably.
<Polydurian> All those spiders?
<Polydurian> Or was it Read it and Weep?
<Canadian_Brony> not only did I get no Coca-Cola, but I almost got caught in the act
<Biglaw> SuperBrony64 http://fav.me/d5615c9 what do you think of this?
<DeadpoolDash> http://youtu.be/n8Z6qiA0GR8
<Alchemist> KiwiBoi777: if 15°C is half as hot as 30°C, then how many times is 0°C hotter than -50°C? trollface.jpg
<cher3ry> you'll never be the Element of Petty Theft, Canadian_Brony.
<Biglaw> Alchemist fifty
<Canadian_Brony> cher3ry I've known that for years
<KiwiBoi777> Alchemist: 50 degrees
<cher3ry> Alchemist: your premise is wrong. Use Kelvin. :-P
<Alchemist> cher3ry: we have a winner :)
<Canadian_Brony> brb. I'm going to take a different approach . . .
<Biglaw> Canadian_Brony It's a trap!
<cher3ry> I didn't go get three degrees to get caught by troll physics :D
<AttackPony|Zzz> I'm going to bed ,you guys. Nigth
*AttackPony|Zzz hugs the chat
<Biglaw> night AttackPony|Zzz!
<HatchetRyda> nite nite AttackPony|Zzz
*Biglaw hugs AttackPony|Zzz
<Polydurian> Okay, I think I found the reason for Spiderman's inception in Ponyfanon: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOb961sYXF8
<HatchetRyda> and i guess im doin the same, later yall
<Alchemist> If there is 20 degrees in my room and 3 degrees outside, I like to open the window to let those 3 additional degrees inisde :D
<Ponies47> That'll be- *puts﻿ on sunglasses* 8 BITS! :P
<Ponies47> (Rimshot)
<xMLPxREACTORx> thats so big words :D
<Canadian_Brony> . . .
<Ponies47> :p
*Canadian_Brony grumbles curses under his breath
<Biglaw> Canadian_Brony get caught?
<Ghosties> 04Spiderman's been around in the fandom for much longer than Read It and Weep
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: What happened?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Actually Polydurian my theory is 4chan
<Biglaw> A wild Ghosties appeared!
<Polydurian> Oh yeah?
<Alchemist> cher3ry: if you want troll physics listen to kent hovind.
<Polydurian> Goodness sake, 4chan.
<Canadian_Brony> Biglaw yes, but I got away. I didn't have a can on me, and it's easy to lie to someone who's half asleep
<Ghosties> 04He was around since I became a brony, when a poster on Ponychan was posting as Spiderman
<Ponies47> I have never watched 1960's Spiderman :$
<CrimsonPhoenix> Spider thread were around everywhere and while it amused the people in MLPG they possibly made crossover pics
<cher3ry> Alchemist: no thanks, I already have to deal with troll medicine on an annoyingly common basis.
<Biglaw> Ponies47 WHAAAAT
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 I failed trying to grab a can of Coca-Cola from downstairs without being notiched. Twice
<Ghosties> 04This was March or April of 2011
<xMLPxREACTORx> what type of pony would you want to be
<Canadian_Brony> ROUND 3!
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: YOU FAILED! boooooooooooooo booooooooooooo
<Biglaw> I would be a pegasys!
<Biglaw> pegasus*
<Biglaw> derp
<CrimsonPhoenix> Actually I remember Spider thread for a good long while ago
<Biglaw> :p
<MadSurge> Ghosties: then bless Spiderman :D
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 STFU, this one will work!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Heck I think before MLP
<Canadian_Brony> I garuntee!
<Alchemist> btw whats the meaning of the whole spiderman meme in mlp? does it even have one, or is it just something that exists?
<Ponies47> Biglaw: I have never watched 1960's Spiderman :$
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Sorry :(
<Polydurian> What's the meaning of memes in general, Alchemist?
<Biglaw> Ponies47 WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?
<CrimsonPhoenix> the origin to combine the two though is undefined
<Ponies47> Biglaw: You heard me :$
*Canadian_Brony wasn't around to see Ponies47's reply
<MadSurge> Ponies47: it's goofy as shit and it's hilarious :D
<Ponies47> MadSurge: How long did it run?
<MadSurge> No idea
<CrimsonPhoenix> Alchemist that's just it though, people knew spiderman was funny and with everything even spiderman got pony crossover
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: I said 'Sorry :('
<CrimsonPhoenix> it was probably a big hit and spread
<Polydurian> I dunno, you'd think shows would get tired after all that running...
<Alchemist> Polydurian: the ones I saw are usually make fun of certain situations (like foulf bachelor frog, good guy greg etc)...
<Ponies47> hmmm. Maybe I should watch an episode then :$
<Ponies47> yes no maybe? :p
<Ponies47> I killed the chat :(
<xMLPxREACTORx> yes
<Polydurian> I'd say knock yourself out.
*KiwiBoi777 hugs Ponies47
<Alchemist> but whats the point the spiderman meme trying to make and being embraced so much it wins a freaking cosplay contest at a MLP convention :D
*Ponies47 Hugs KiwiBoi777 back
<Polydurian> I often feel that way myself, Ponies47.
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/60s-spider-man
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh here's something interesting
<CrimsonPhoenix> it originate from /co/ like MLP
<xMLPxREACTORx> what what what
<CrimsonPhoenix> well the Bronies

<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Polydurian> ForEVER.
<Polydurian> ...
<Alchemist> bronystate, derpyboo.ru and EQD are the only mlp related sites I visit. Thats enough for me.
<Quick_Thinker> MLP reactor theres too many brony sites here the one most of them know Bronystate, Equestria daily and Equestria gaming
<Phase4> 00,02Polydurian, go to about:plugins in firefox
<Ghosties> 04<CrimsonPhoenix> I would ask to please investigate before mindlessly judge. <-- I hope you're not talking to me, Phoenix. If you are what I'll tell you "it's no excuse that I didn't see theirs, I still caught yours and you should know better"
<Polydurian> I've stopped visiting Equestria Daily lately.
<KiwiBoi777> me too
<Alchemist> how come?
<Quick_Thinker> so anybody want to rate my fic since the stream is doing nothing>
<Alchemist> thats like THE news portal for MLP
<xMLPxREACTORx> i never went there;)
<Quick_Thinker> if not im fine with it just want to know actualy bronies thought how i did XD
<Ponies47> MadSurge: Classmate of mine convinced me to watch an epiosde. I was in solo when I did this I really wasen't hating anymore. My first episode was Lesson Zero I fell in love with the show about 5 minutes in. I spent the rest of dat weekend watch pony episode after pony episode. When I realized I was a brony you wouldn't beleave how scared I was
<Quick_Thinker> DAT WALL
<Phase4> 00,02Polydurian, can you tell me what version of java you have? allso when you say it doesnt work exactly what do you meen'
<Ponies47> :$
<cher3ry> I had problems with the latest java release too, actually... uninstalled and went back to the last java version 6.
<MadSurge> Ponies47: Once I heard the name "Lauren Faust" I knew it was a quality show :D
<xMLPxREACTORx> the only thin about mlp i cant see is the opening
<Ponies47> MadSurge: Ah. I liekd Foster's :)
<Ponies47> *liked
<Polydurian> Hang on, I didn't realize you were talking to me, Phase4 :S
<MadSurge> ^
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_Brony, you too, what exactly is working/not working
<Quick_Thinker> well you think thats nuts watch the G1 intro XD it will kill you
<Phase4> 00,02Polydurian, tis ok :)
<Polydurian> What's this? about:plugins?
<MadSurge> Ponies47: exactly. And the Powerpuff Girls :D
<Phase4> 00,02Polydurian, its a list of plugins loaded into firefox
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 I open the link and a lavendar screen appears. After that, nothing happens.
<Ponies47> MadSurge: I loved that show to! :)

<Ponies47> MadSurge: Yeah. Both my brotehr and I enjoyed the show my dad didn't mind us watching it either :p
<Polydurian> Can I see that link again?
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_Brony, in theory its easy, in practice attaching a debugger is insanely painfull
<Ponies47> *brother
<Quick_Thinker> kinda of fail but still a win XD
<MadSurge> Rain: SpiderSparkle :D
<Polydurian> Rain: Headpony!
<Phase4> 00,02Polydurian, http://paintchat.bronystate.net/ ?

<MadSurge> Ponies47: My dad was baffled by the amount of adult jokes in that show. And the Beatles episode :D
<Quick_Thinker> so anyone wanna stream or arre we gonna discuss the new adobe
<Ponies47> MadSurge: Every show has adult jokes :p
<Ponies47> Meh. One of these days I'll re-tell my brony story to ya'll :)
<Quick_Thinker> for instance Animaincs GOT TON OF ADULT HUMOR CAUSE IT TRICKED THE CENSORS
<Ponies47> But I don't feal like it :0
<Ponies47> :)
<MadSurge> Ponies47: some shows have better ones though :P
<Polydurian> Phase4, I have the applet on but I can't seem to draw anything.
<FairysHuff> Morning everypony *Yawns while hugging chat*

<Polydurian> Wait, why am I still a durian?
<Ponies47> Name the best Fox cartoon
<Polydunami> Better.
<Ponies47> GO!
<Polydunami> Also, hey FairysHuff!
<Quick_Thinker> so anypony want to try rating my fic if not its cool just want to know how i did in the eyes of a true brony unlike the bronies on FIMfic who just seem to be rude
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: Yo
<Ninjazz> >true brony
<Ninjazz> Not sure if there can be a "true" brony.
<Ninjazz> I mean... what is consdierd a brony?
<Om> +__(\ drat
*Ponies47 Listens to What is Pootis? for the 100th time
<Rain> What is a Brony?
<Quick_Thinker> one who is not an ass spreading kindess and joy pinkie style
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: There can. A brony that encapsulates the virtues of the show.
<Rain> A worthless pile of friendship.
<Polydunami> WORTHLESS!?
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: I try to do my best to do just that
<MahBoi777> ^
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff, and if one just enjoys ponies?
*Ponies47 Needs pony shirts to wear out in public
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Then their a hedge brony ^_^
<Rain> god, you guys sadden me
<Quick_Thinker> rain i was listening to dracullas speech about what a man is and as soon as he said a miserble pile of seccrets your comment appeared CREEPY
<Polydunami> Worst thing you can do as a fan is label someone else "not a true fan"
<Starflash> Polydunami, it's a reference :D please hold your rage.
<Rain> the ref went right over you rheads
<xMLPxREACTORx> what would you do if you were in ponyvill
<Polydunami> I know what the reference is, Rain.
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff, so are you saying that there are bronies that are quintisentially better than other bronies?
*MahBoi777 glomps Starflash
<Polydunami> It's Symphony of the Night, correct?
<MahBoi777> hey Starflash! how are you doing?:)
<Starflash> Hallo MahBoi777.
<Rain> ja
<Starflash> Pretty good :3
<MahBoi777> good!^^
<Quick_Thinker> well for one if i was in ponyville im sure pinkie would kill me thinking i would be able to morph back like the rest of her friends
*Ninjazz is uneducated in your ways
<Starflash> Although I have a bunch of work to do today & stuff
<Liokin> Sup everypony :)
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Yes, obviously. If someone takes on the virtue of kindness via the show but another is just an asshole wouldn't you say that the person with kindness is better?
<Quick_Thinker> hi Liokin
<MahBoi777> good luck Starflash
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> anyone bored?
<MahBoi777> hi Liokin
<Starflash> So how are you MahBoi777 ?
<Rain> I say the guy who made this is best brony http://denver.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw5492-13402168132442.gif
<MahBoi777> Starflash: I am doing awesome, can't wait for the weekend to get here
<hen3ry> dude, that's creepy. </Spike>
<Polydunami> Again, Rain, HEADPONY.
<Ponies47> Ways you can celebrate "Derpy Day:"- Eat muffins- Hand-deliver a letter- Make derpy eyes- Wear a Derpy Hooves tee :P
<Starflash> MahBoi777: I can't wait for summer break to get here :T
<Quick_Thinker> Rain i will be haunted by that till the day i die for that i CURSE YOU >:C
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff, but that's human natue. If they are both bronies, they are bronies. One is a good brony and the other is an asshole. The difference? One is an asshole while the other is generally a nice guy/girl.
<MahBoi777> Starflash: how many more weeks do you have?
<Rain> glad I could help, Quick_Thinker
<hen3ry> I don't think I can make derpy eyes. At least, not on purpose. 6_9
<Quick_Thinker> i can :)
<xMLPxREACTORx> i would try to find a spell to transform me in to a alcorn of the type like luna
<Quick_Thinker> it feels wierd after a long time though
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Human nature sucks >_> Far too many assholes in the world. We need more people who take on the virtues of MLP
<Quick_Thinker> alicorn can backfire on you in so many ways MLP reactor
<Ponies47> Quick_Thinker: Nice. You lucky ^_^
<Starflash> MahBoi777: less than one. Final exams are starting in 5 days
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff, wishful thinking.
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: True ~_~
<Quick_Thinker> yeah but never fall asleep like it i learned the hard way my eyes were stuck like that for a week
*Ninjazz pats FairysHuff on the back
<MahBoi777> Starflash: well I hope everything goes well for ya
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: But nothing will change if people don't try.
<xMLPxREACTORx> how would it backfire
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Thankies ^_^
<Starflash> me too :')
<MahBoi777> :)
<Canadian_Brony> g'night everypony!
<MahBoi777> gnight Canadian_Brony
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> bay Canadian_Brony
<FairysHuff> Night Canadian_Brony
<Polydunami> Goodnight Canadian_Brony!
<Polydunami> Eh?
<hen3ry> Night, British Columbian Brony.
<Quick_Thinker> well if it were a fanfic everyone would be sick of it quickly if it was to be bad ass you not all powerful pretty much your then a king having to look after the land so its not all raise the sun and lower the moon fun
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff, I'm sure people have given the show a chance. I know I have... but tbh, I don't do all of the virtues of MLP because it's from MLP. But because I've been taught to do it.
<Polydunami> hen3ry, I'm the British Columbian Brony.
<hen3ry> I believe Canadian is also from BC.
<Canadian_Brony> if you said "Eh?", I leave with this: http://www.flickr.com/photos/47063070@N06/4706853733/lightbox/
<Canadian_Brony> g'night all!
<Ninjazz> Gni... damn it.
<Ponies47> One pony shirt I really wanna get http://www.redbubble.com/people/sirhcx/works/8913066-pinkie-pie-is-watching-you-forever <- THIS ONE! :)
<Quick_Thinker> Eh?
<Ponies47> Night Can.............
<Ponies47> SHOOT!
<Quick_Thinker> i wish pinkie was watching me XD
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: People should hold the virtues naturally yes but the MLP show helps to reinforce those virtues when living in a society where lies and corruption are the way of life.
<Polydunami> Goodness sake, does he even know that I'm Canadian as well?
<Quick_Thinker> wait they came out wrong
<hen3ry> well he does if he saw the last couple lines on his screen before he quit
<Ponies47> You gotta love that smile? :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Time To Sleep, Goodnight everyone ~
*Polydunami watches Quick_Thinker intently O_O
<Rain> a cat
<MahBoi777> gnight TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Ponies47> Night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Ninjazz> Gnight, TheGreatAndPowerfulT. Take care.
<Rain> no wait, a fan, because I am on my side
<Liokin> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Later bro /)
<Polydunami> See you T!
<Quick_Thinker> are you the RL pinkie pie Polydunami?
<MadSurge> Ponies47: Best pony watching us? YAY
<Ghosties> 04Liokin, you've got some good drawing skills man
<Ghosties> 04I've seen some of your work, pretty neat
<Liokin> Ghosties: Thank you kindly sir ^-^
<Ponies47> I'm a big Pinkie Pie fan. But I think everypony is best pony but for a few :P
<Liokin> Ghosties: Im always open for request if you have one.
<Polydunami> I dunno, last time I looked in the mirror I liked what I saw ^__^
<xMLPxREACTORx> screw you dicord
<Liokin> Ghosties: Ships, OC redraws etc..
<Ponies47> MadSurge: Pinkie Pie be watching with epic Twilight Sparkle smile? Guess so :P
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff, just crediting the show just because it gives off a good message is rather... silly. People can like the show for what it is but not have to follow the virtues. In the end... it's still just entertainment.
<FairysHuff> I would like to thank my Amatryptoline for my relatively good sleep.
<Quick_Thinker> open for requests hmmmmmm i want to ask but it will seem like being such a lazy bastard but seeing as how i cant draw for shiat
<Ghosties> 04Nah, it's fine. I just thought your Shizuka x Vi was pretty neat
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Thats the same as saying honesty is a quaint concept but useless.
<Ponies47> I suck at art :(
<Polydunami> Actually, I'm being narcissistic about that so never mind :S
<Quick_Thinker> well lets be honest the show also give some people some hope that all the world is not out to kill them when luck is down on them and about to finish them off
<MadSurge> Ponies47: can only imagine what you were thinking during Twi's mental breakdown :D
<Liokin> Ghosties: Thanks I always appreciate comments.
<Ghosties> 04Not a problem
<xMLPxREACTORx> when i first heard of bronys i though yu were all trolls but you guy are so cool kids
<Quick_Thinker> (now how would i know that) I WAS TOTALLY NOT IN THAT POSITION BEFORE NAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Ghosties> 04>kids
<xMLPxREACTORx> fine guys
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff, are you saying that watching the show requires you to change yourself?
<xMLPxREACTORx> men
<Ghosties> 04Interestingly enough, a lot of our userbase are kids :P
<Ninjazz> Ikr?
<Ponies47> MadSurge: Hmmmm. I wa thinking. Sheeesh this is for little girls? 6_9 And that's why I'm also a big fan of crazy Twilight! :)
<Quick_Thinker> mental breakdowns are very frequesnt with me
<Ponies47> *was
<Quick_Thinker> can i ge that comment removed?
<Ghosties> 04If you've been in the fandom for as long as I have (and yes, a year is a long time in this fandom), the whole "grown men being into ponies" thing has kinda been subverted
<MadSurge> How so?
<Ghosties> 04Because a lot of the bronies I see now are teenagers
<Quick_Thinker> seriously i dont think i should have typed i have mental breakdowns offten XD
<xMLPxREACTORx> me
<xMLPxREACTORx> to
<Ponies47> I forget when I joined the herd. But it will be 2 months on #bronystate on the 7th :0
<Ponies47> :)
<MadSurge> Well it's nice to see teens into ponies too <3
<Ponies47> ^
<Ponies47> :)
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Not a requirement but a choice to take on the messages or not to. You can enjoy it as just entertainment but isn't that the shallow way of doing so? Or should we allow lies and corruption to be the social norm for our society? I don't think so. For example I've been actively encouraged to lie when applying for jobs. The idea sickens me.
<Ghosties> 04Feels like you've been here longer, 47
<Quick_Thinker> well i joined the herd but did not know about this site till i broused the web and saw PONY CHAT REACTIONS TO DERPY
*EggWhite yawns "morning everypony"
<MahBoi777> mornin EggWhite
<hen3ry> same here, it was a youtube walk that clued me into bronystate's existence.
<Quick_Thinker> and then looked at the site and decided ehhh why not lets jump in this
<xMLPxREACTORx> am i in the herd wait what is the herd
<Ponies47> Morning EggWhite :0
<Quick_Thinker> no clue XD
<Ponies47> :)
<Quick_Thinker> okay to be honest
<hen3ry> so i herd you like herds so i got you a herd you can herd while u herd... nevermind.
<EggWhite> How is everypony doing on this fine day?
<Quick_Thinker> its our term for welcomeing you as a official brony
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff, this is a kid's show we are talking about. Not the cure to society's troubles. If I want to sit down at the end of a day and want to smile, I'll watch ponies. I don't watch ponies to be reminded that the world sucks.
<Polydunami> xMLPxREACTORx http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3709/
<Ponies47> We all love ponies right? But aren't there somtimes we're we just wanna say confound these ponies! I do :P
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Kids are the cure to societys troubles.
<Rain> pfffft
<Ninjazz> >.>
<Rain> kids are a part of the troubles
<Ponies47> I hate little kids! :[
<MahBoi777> KIDS ARE TEH FUTURE
<Ninjazz> And bad mothers are the cause of society's problems, then?
<FairysHuff> heheh ^_^ And I thought I was cyncial.
<Polydunami> One question: what is the CAUSE of society's troubles?
*Ninjazz hugs FairysHuff
<Ninjazz> Polydunami, Monay.
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: *Hugs*
<Polydunami> I got Ninjazz'd.
<EggWhite> ...Flash crashed...again.
<Ninjazz> I'm a verb? XD
<Quick_Thinker> well i want ponies to spread to as many things a possible even once took my own liberty to spread the brony love to the COD community man did that back fire in my face like Aqua Puria (Aqua Puria is highly acidic water that has been known to kill most people AND IM NOT TELLING HOW TO MAKE IT)
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: The cause of societys troubles is this promotion of selfish greed and many other unsavoury characteristics which are seen as norm now.
<Polydunami> Who promotes all of that, then?
<Quick_Thinker> yeah but if you try to spread hapiness it seems that your rejected and tohught as strange
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: Society itself. It spreads like a disease
<Ponies47> http://www.redbubble.com/people/wesleyfung2/works/8757205-confound-these-ponies-insomnia <- MY KIND OF SHIRT! :D
<FairysHuff> Quick_Thinker: Exactly
<EggWhite> Ninjazz: one sec let me check with Sweetie Belle.
<Ponies47> Because crazy Twilight is on it :P
<FairysHuff> Speaking of RedBubble MLP shirts. Mine have finally been shipped. Should arrive by next week I hope.
<Quick_Thinker> seriously i did the craziest thing i have ever done i TOOK over my schools announcements for a long time and after a awhile i gained the schools love but as soon as i played SMILE via itercom i got beat up and thrown off a roof
<Polydunami> Okay, then. What is a society comprised of?
<Ninjazz> EggWhite, will do.
<Ponies47> FairysHuff: Gald to here
<Ponies47> Quick_Thinker: OUCH! >_<
<Quick_Thinker> so in all reality Ponys have done much more for me than humanity and that is SAD
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: People who look to get the best they can for themselves. Usually by stepping on others to get it.
<DerpyHooves_Lova> Hola did i miss ponies?
<FairysHuff> Ponies47: As am I
<DerpyHooves_Lova> Or is it a movie
<Polydunami> Hey Quick_Thinker, who MADE those ponies?
<DeadpoolDash> well Humanity kind of made ponies
<Ponies47> Hey DerpyHooves_Lova :)
<Quick_Thinker> humanity has just looked on me and brushed me off as a useless parasite
<Quick_Thinker> Laurn Faust
<Quick_Thinker> why?
<EggWhite> Ninjazz: Sweetie Belle says no but she will add you to the next version.
<Ponies47> FairysHuff: I gotta order some shirts. They got to many good ones! :d
<Ninjazz> EggWhite, Yay~ :D
<FairysHuff> Ponies47: Yuss... far too many good ones. I limited myself to just two shirts. But theres were a great many more I wanted.
<DerpyHooves_Lova> Im hoping i get a I <3 derpy shirt soon
<Polydunami> Well, don't you think Lauren Faust is a part of humanity?
<Quick_Thinker> hell in a way i kinda of felt Twi's insanity in lesson zero no one belive me that a girl was cheating on my best friends and it back fired in the biggest way ever
<DerpyHooves_Lova> Is it ponies or a movie, If its ponies im missing them D:
<DerpyHooves_Lova> :S
<Quick_Thinker> nothing is streaming
<DerpyHooves_Lova> Oh
<Rain> lol
<Polydunami> Okay, this really bugs me. Do you think you're not part of the humanity you seem to berate?
<Ponies47> You know I think I have Insomnia. Because when I'm at my moms and poeple come into my room I get mad very easy. Maybe I should stop going to bed at like 4:00 AM :S
<FairysHuff> http://www.redbubble.com/people/zedrin/works/8855395-tom-got-an-upgrade?body_color=navy&p=t-shirt&print_location=front&size=medium&style=mens
<DerpyHooves_Lova> :) hi
<Ponies47> FairysHuff: EPIC
<DerpyHooves_Lova> Ponies or a movie?
<FairysHuff> Ponies47: Yuss ^_^
<Marx> Boy, do I have a tendancy to stay up al night.
<EggWhite> There is something on stream, the most entertaining thing in the Omniverse...The Buffering Circle!
<Quick_Thinker> yeah im part of humanity and that ashames me more than anything else that this world has went from glorious one day to falling apart in my face the next
*Ninjazz hails the Holy Circle
<Marx> So I better go ahead and go to bed. Good morning guys.
<MahBoi777> ALL hail the holy buffer

<Ponies47> FairysHuff: Maybe I should do what you do and buy 2 shirts at a time
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: You beat me to it. I was going to make the hypnosis joke ^_^
<EggWhite> I'm not a part of humanity I am a tortoise COCKADOODLE DOO!
<Rain> Liokin. I thought you meant Lord Celestia and I was like wuuuuut

<Liokin> Rain: No you silly filly.

<FlareChaser> SuperBrony64: Why, I feel welcomed here still. :3
<FanCamp> Anime always hurts my ears.
<Quick_Thinker> night everypony
<Polydunami> FairysHuff, that is the most hilarious synopsis of an anime I have ever heard xD
<Ponies47> Quick_Thinker: Don't feal bad. Goodnight :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02FlareChaser: Ofc you will be, you're the coolest :D
<FlareChaser> :O
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: But true ^_^ And even more hilarious than it sounds.
<FlareChaser> Thanks, SuperBrony64! :D
<Biglaw> SuperBrony64 :( but... I thought you said I was?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^.^
<Polydunami> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C5LJHXrO0o Anime based on the freaking Cthulhu Mythos xD
<FlareChaser> Silly Biglaw, everyone is the coolest!
<xMLPxREACTORx> the only thing did not get about the s2 finale was when pink one use magis so he would love her that means she is not any different then that evil queen
<Polydunami> Which one is based on Cthulhu, then?
<Biglaw> FlareChaser but... If everypony is cool, nopony is!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Everypony is the coolest who comes here on a regular basis. ^.^
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: The actual Cthulhu god itself?
<FlareChaser> then we're all cool noponies. ;)
<xMLPxREACTORx> whats cthulhu
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Indeed :3
<FanCamp> In a strange way, I dig what you're saying. But then again, the changling was supposed to be pure control.
<Rain> xMLPxREACTORx, she used the power of love to snap him out of a trance.
<Polydunami> Yeah, Cthulhu himself
<FanCamp> IDK, that is a little strange.
<FlareChaser> Well, that change was fast :P
<Polydunami> Or it :S
<Biglaw> SuperBrony64 yay! And what did you think of the picture?
<Polydunami> *itself
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Biglaw: Awesome!! I faved it ^-^
<Biglaw> SuperBrony64 yay!
<FanCamp> It could be say a spell of ICY HOT. Icy to dull the pain then hot to relax!
*Biglaw hugs SuperBrony64
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: I believe he's an end of season boss I'd expect. The main character is the girl with silver hair who is the god of "Crawling Chaos" ^_^ I can't spell the actual name
<Ponies47> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93kBPeH1w8c&feature=g-all-u CRUSH KILL DESTORY SWAG!
<FanCamp> Cadence can be found in any cold and flu aisle.
<Biglaw> Boys have swag, Gentlemen have class
<Ghosties> 04^
<Polydunami> Nyarlathotep, huh?
*Ghosties hates that word, "swag"
<FanCamp> Rain, he was already out of the trance when she did her love spell thing.
<TrixieBaconMuffin> Ia Ia Chtulhu f'taghn!
<Rain> she used it to snap him out and then used it again to boost his spell
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: Yes, that one I can't spell. There are other gods from the Cthulhu Mythos in the anime as well
<Polydunami> I understand
<Vordox> YEEEEEEEEEEEES
<Rain> also, chrysalis doesnt force anybody to love her. she just disguises herself as someone who they already love
<FanCamp> I may have to watch again, but I think the changling revealed herself after the real Cadence showed up.
<Vordox> OROCHIMARU!
<Vordox> BABY
<Vordox> Missed ya
<Biglaw> For some reason, when it's 5 in the morning, my mind is a lot more logical
<Biglaw> and focused
<Biglaw> :I
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: you feel that change?
<FlareChaser> its a nice change.
<FanCamp> Then what about that spell she used to make Shining Armor's eyes to go all 6 . 9
<Biglaw> FlareChaser I call it the "Up All Night" effect
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: http://youtu.be/RQtqkxv609A
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: now, you see....chicken.
<Rain> FanCamp, that is after she has drained a lot of their power. She then uses that spell not to make them love her, but to make them slaves
<TrixieBaconMuffin> huh , get a website offline for the stream window . is there anything on atm ?
<Polydunami> Well, well, well. That's an Elder God for you.
<Ghosties> 04No, Trixie
<Ghosties> 04The stream is offline
<Rain> streamers need their sleep too
<adam> LOL
<Rain> what?
<TrixieBaconMuffin> streamers are just bandsof colored paper , what do they need sleep for ?
<Ponies47> Yeah we all need are sleep :p
<xMLPxREACTORx> fuck trixie
<Biglaw> Dor some reason, I love this time of day. It's just barely dark out
<Rain> they do a lot of waving around, TrixieBaconMuffin. its tiring work
<Biglaw> for*
<FairysHuff> http://youtu.be/tImkmgODoC0
<FanCamp> Rain, I think you're just pulling stuff out of your ass there.
<Biglaw> FanCamp that would be amazing to see
<Biglaw> wait
<Biglaw> no
<Biglaw> ew
<Rain> FanCamp. I was talking about how TrixieBaconMuffin was making a joke about the word "streamers"
<Rain> I was going along with the joke
<Polydunami> Okay, I got to the creepy part of this "Missing Frequencies" thingy.
<xMLPxREACTORx> lol
<Biglaw> I think listening to "Smile Song" on loop is contributing to me being awake
<xMLPxREACTORx> weed i keep me awake
<xMLPxREACTORx> jk
<Polydunami> When it first started, my head felt all tingly.
<FanCamp> I was talking about the season finale and Chysalis, Rain.
<xMLPxREACTORx> llo
<xMLPxREACTORx> lol
<TrixieBaconMuffin> btw , what anime were you discussing back there with mythos gods in it ?
<Polydunami> Nyarko-san: Another Crawling Chaos
<Rain> FanCamp. you are not good with phychology are you? If you notice at the end when she reveals herself, armor just stands there. he isnt loving. he is just a vegetable
*Biglaw is lip singing Smile Song :D
<xMLPxREACTORx> what pony would fuck and why
<Rain> and he nods in agreement when she adresses him
<Polydunami> Yep, Nyarlathotep is the cutest elder god I've ever seen :3
<FairysHuff> http://youtu.be/8vu6SOEnF7M
<TrixieBaconMuffin> you clearly have not yet seen the chtulhu plushy
<Polydunami> SAND CANYON.
<FlareChaser> wat.
<Biglaw> BASS CANNON
<Biglaw> WUBWUBWUB
<FanCamp> Yeah, just looked up the part. Yeah, she does snap him out of a trance and the whole him being a slave after being weakened. But how is that big enough to use the word "phychology"?
<Polydunami> Hmm, I think I could compare this show to Oh My Goddess.
<FairysHuff> Ok I'm done linking videos of awesome animes now. You can all go back to staring at mr hypno circle in the stream ^_^
<Polydunami> What with a strong goddess falling for the average male lead and all.
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: Oh My Goddess is much more tame than Nyarko
<Rain> I guess big words are not something you enjoy? I could have said brain workings
<Polydunami> Never said that was a BAD thing...
<FlareChaser> >wat
<Polydunami> But both sides have their pluses for me.
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: Neither did I ^_^
<FanCamp> You truly are a card there Mr. Algae studier.
<FanCamp> Aka Rain.
<Rain> >Mr
<Rain> nope, sorry try again
<Ghosties> 04Fuck the mole boss on Donkey Kong Country Returns >:O
<Rain> also, Algae studier?
<xMLPxREACTORx> is there a site were i can go read fanfictions for mlp
<Polydunami> Rain, I think you were just called a card :3
<TrixieBaconMuffin> try fimfiction
<Rain> Oh! Oh! Can I be the wild card?
<xMLPxREACTORx> thanks
<FanCamp> Especially since it's entertainment of a trance. Which really isn't possible unless you're a hypochondriac.
<Polydunami> Fine, just don't make a mess :|
<Polydunami> :)
<Rain> what? FanCamp?
<FanCamp> You don't know the meaning of phycology, Rain.
<Rain> are you just saying stuff to make yourself look like you kinda know what you are talking about?
<xMLPxREACTORx> what was the site name again
<EggWhite> Yellop again everypony.
<Polydunami> That's fimfiction.net
<FanCamp> The same could be said to you, Rain.
<xMLPxREACTORx> thanks agiain
<Rain> maybe, exept I do know what I am talking about
<FanCamp> Okay then, explain to me how an outside imposed trance is possible.
<Polydunami> I'm going to be a couple of minutes.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ghosties: IKR
<Starchaser> what are the movies for friday movie night
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Road to El Dorado and Robin Hood: Men in Tights
<Rain> hmm. assuming we are talking about Shining Armor's trance that chrysalis put him in, I would have to answer with
<Rain> did you not see her use magic to put him in one?
<EggWhite> Oh hey SuperBrony64, durian?
<FanCamp> You're kidding me right?
<xMLPxREACTORx> do i really need a ancount
<xMLPxREACTORx> thats bullshit
<Rain> also, in the real world, sugestive hypnotism
<SuperBrony64> 11,02EggWhite: Yesh please :3/
<Rain> and no Im not kidding you. you obviously dont watch the show if you didnt notice that she used magic to put him in a trance
<FairysHuff> Why is the hypno circle in stream telling me to kill? O_o
<FanCamp> Suggestive hypnotism? How do you do that?
*EggWhite gives SuperBrony64 a giant o durians
*SuperBrony64 noms on durians :3
<FlareChaser> ...
<FlareChaser> Chicken.
<Polydunami> Lucky, SuperBrony64 :S
<Rain> excuse me for typing slowly
<EggWhite> Pichonko
<FanCamp> Seriously, Rain. You are a weiner. I went and double checked and gave credit to what you said as to Cadence breaking SA out of a trance.
*EggWhite gives Polydunami a durian
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I wish I had real durians to try :/
<Rain> ever whisper into someone's ear while they sleep?
<FanCamp> Ever give someone a roofie?
<EggWhite> Sorry misa don't have any real ones :(
<Polydunami> No, I want to eat one for real. With my mouth.
<FanCamp> Or get them liqoured up?
<xMLPxREACTORx> yes
<Rain> no actually
<Rain> nope
<FanCamp> You know, something that isn't in a T.V. show?
<xMLPxREACTORx> i have like boss
<Rain> stoned and or drunk is not hypnotised :\
<FanCamp> But it does weakened their will.
<FanCamp> And they are more likely to be okay with what you ask of them.
<Rain> no it makes them loose their inhabitions
<FairysHuff> Well... This is interesting chat. Think I'll go watch anime ^_^ Nyrako crawling chaos here I come.
<FanCamp> But full control out of the blue would be Scopolamine.
<Polydunami> FanCamp and Rain said pretty much the same thing at the same time.
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Testing Testing 1 2 3, 3 2 1 gnitset gnitset.
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Ok my nick did change... ignore me.
<Biglaw> Yaaay, light :p
<Rain> just hear that word recently, eh?
<cyber_pony13> happy fourth of july everypony
<FanCamp> Which word? And why?
<Rain> meh, whatever. this argument is going nowhere
<FanCamp> Because you're losing?
<Rain> pfffft
<Rain> arguing is not a contest
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Huh what argurment people were arguing?
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> I didn't notice.
<Lone_Lycan|AFK> and who's winning?
<cyber_pony13> charlie sheen is winning
<FanCamp> So says the fellow who says I don't watch the show in solemn victory of the word phycology
<Polydunami> Lone_Lycan, in an argument, the spectators win.
<Rain> also, when debating something, being the loudest does not mean you are right.
<Lone_Lycan|AFK> yay, i win!
<FanCamp> I'd still love to hear what your suggestive hypnotism is.
<MMMbananasguy> Rain parlement disagrees with you...
<Rain> its suggesting something to someone in a way that makes them believe it was their idea, not yours
<FanCamp> Other than "whispering in someones ear when they're asleep."
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Ok I'm gonna start an argument, umm platonic chess is better then Renkoshima
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> than
<Biglaw> SuperBrony64 well, now I see a nice amount of light coming to the room, and I am happily enjoying the Smile Song :3 moo
<Biglaw> Successful All Nighter
*Phase4 00,02hugs SuperBrony64
*Biglaw hugs everypony
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Anyone going to say something in Renkoshima's defence?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Biglaw: Yay :D Moo :3
*SuperBrony64 hugs Phase4 back :3
<FanCamp> Rain, that sounds about right, but I'm still not convinced of your understanding of it.
*EggWhite|DurianTrade is hugged and hugs back
*Ninjazz hugs Biglaw back
*Biglaw :3
<Polydunami> I think I saw this movie, Rain
<Mutterguy> EggWhite|DurianTrade ignorance kind of leaves me out of the debate
<Mutterguy> as it should
<SuperBrony64> 11,02all the wub ^-^
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> You don't know what Renkoshima is!?
*Biglaw nomz on SuperBrony64
<Rain> FanCamp, that was like saying "oh I know what it is, but why dont you explain it just so I know that /you/ know what it is"
*SuperBrony64 is nommed on O.O;;
<FanCamp> Oh ho, so the evidence table has turned, has it Rain?
*Biglaw gives SuperBrony64 a cupcake
<Rain> Mutterguy, that doesnt stop most people :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:D
*SuperBrony64 noms on cupcake :3c
<Rain> oh no no
<Rain> Im not suggesting that, FanCamp
<Mutterguy> or platonic chess which i assume is chess without sex but assume there has to be some difference between platonic chess and conventional chess
<FanCamp> Really?
<Rain> Im just saying that Im going to stop here
<Rain> because I have arguments like this all the time
<Rain> and it almost always ends with "I troll u"
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Biglaw we should combine my durian with you cupcake to give SuperBrony64 a durian cupcake!
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> your
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:O
<FanCamp> Because I'll bring something up that'll wallop you?
<Rain> nope
<Mutterguy> Well. most people aer doing it wrong!
*Biglaw motherofgod.jpg
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Can we?
<Rain> because most people run out of things to argue with
<FanCamp> Neat trick.
<Rain> ikr?
<Biglaw> Rain I beg to differ!
*Biglaw has made an argument
<Rain> get shown up and then redeam yourself by saying you were trolling the entire time?
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> I differ to beg!
<Rain> fucking einstine there
<Mutterguy> You aren't just attempting to be contradictory are you Biglaw because that's not arguing.
*Rain has no respect for those that do that btw
<Biglaw> -_-
<Polydunami> I'd say an argument is over when one party starts taunting the other.
*Biglaw wants to have a good time
<FanCamp> Well, I was about to give you props for instigating the arguement, but now I'm convinced you're posturing.
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Biglaw we can have a good time...DANCE PARTY!
<Mutterguy> Has everyone seen the argument sketch?
*EggWhite|DurianTrade starts to dance.
<Rain> I instigated? no sir/mam
<Biglaw> .me dances
*Biglaw dance
<Rain> you doubted my understanding of psychology
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Yay
<FlareChaser> Oh look, a stream :3

<dar-k-stalkers> streamception?
<Biglaw> Don't cross the streams!
<Biglaw> Oh no
<Biglaw> ohno
<Phase4> 00,02cross all the streams
<FanCamp> Alright buddy, Vietnam war. The Draft was heavy in and Koreans were playing a radio station stating such lines as "You don't really know what you're fighting for." or "The government hasn't told you everything."
<Biglaw> septuple stream
<Mutterguy> go on it's not like we're using fusion rays or something!
<FanCamp> This worked well since the draft was being used.
<Ponies47> brb
<Mutterguy> MLPOnline? do tell!
<Rain> oh goody, propaganda out of nowhere *giggles excitedly*
<Phase4> 00,02mlponline is a little broken

<FlareChaser> Alright kids, Flare is gonna go to bed, goodnight to all of you, see you tomorrow :)

*EggWhite|DurianTrade waves back
<FanCamp> Plus a good portion didn't sign up.
<Polydunami> They got volunteered.
<FanCamp> They were there against there will.
<Rain> because even if you thought "pfft, what a load of shit" when you first heard it, later you might hear it when you are starting to doubt what you believe in, and then it is helping to reinforce that doubt
<Biglaw> Oh boy.... Rush hour
<Phase4> 00,02not sure what to do
<Ninjazz> Night, Flare.
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> So what are you guys arguing about.
<Polydunami> I don't even know anymore :S
<Rain> I see no argument here
<Rain> that ended a while ago
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Can we argue about pancakes then?
<Polydunami> Yeah, I think I'm done for the night.
<Biglaw> Phase4 have arma 2?
<Rain> well first you need an argument before you can argue, EggWhite|DurianTrade
<Phase4> 00,02Biglaw, nope
<FanCamp> Then it's just a matter of time before they despise their guv'ment, try to quit or commit suicide.
<Biglaw> awwww
<Rain> exactly, FanCamp :D
<Kammerjunk> Happy American-fireworks-played-to-Russian-music day, everypony!

<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Ok umm, pancakes suck durian cupcakes rock.
<Rain> to each their own, EggWhite|DurianTrade ^_^
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Do we have an arguement?
*Rain shoots down the argument
<Kammerjunk> Were we arguing?
<Kammerjunk> imsorry
<Rain> lol
<FanCamp> And the suggstive hypnotism can be from the young and dumb believeing their guv'ment can't be trusted as if it couldn't have been trusted in the first place.
<Rain> Ghostiessssssssssssssssssssssss

<Rain> "So you like playing with balls, eh?"
<Biglaw> Ghosties oh no... Fanfic called pancakes 0_0
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> What about durian cupcakes?
<Biglaw> WOAH!!!! THE SUN IS RED

<Biglaw> Well, I've hanged out with the awesome-est people on Earth, listened to the smile song on loop for a few hours, and seen a red sun. Life is good
*Rain gives Ghosties a cherrie
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> if a mod is doing it lets all do it
<Polydunami> Why not? Cherries are good!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> LOGIC

<Polydunami> Well, do it right.
<Biglaw> yush

<Polydunami> Yeah, this is usually the time I sign off and head for bed.
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Polydunami. Sleep well.
*Ninjazz yawns

<MadSurge> Ninjazz: I wish for another Derpy cameo :D
<Polydunami> Hey Ninjazz, you can look up the classic Doctor Who serials online.
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> I'm a failure of a mage.
*EggWhite|DurianTrade runs off crying.
<Ninjazz> Polydunami, that's something I plan on doing. Just to lazy to get started. :D
<Polydunami> That's how I first started watching a week ago.
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I think... it's best we leave that where it died off.
<Rain> a cord stopped it?
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: aye D:
<Polydunami> Also, some of the episodes are missing. I've taken to reading the transcripts of those instead.
<Polydunami> As in, lost.
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Never to be found again?
<Polydunami> Well, we hope that's not the case.
<Rain> he just took that like a boss
<Polydunami> Geeze, some of my friends are into Doctor Who. I feel like I'm becoming... a Doctor Who fan.
<yifle1> hello everypony
<Polydunami> Hey yifle1!

<Ninjazz> Polydunami, is it a good thing?
<yifle1> i want to make mlp music
<Polydunami> Well, maybe "fan" is pushing it too hard.
<Polydunami> I don't really consider myself a fan of anything to be honest.
<Ninjazz> Really?
<yifle1> see everypony later
<Ninjazz> Like you're open to just about everthing kind of thing.
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Bye bye yifle1
<Ninjazz> Cya, yifle1. Take care.

<Saturn> 08,01Biglaw: aye
*EggWhite|DurianTrade casts rejuvinate on Saturn.
<Biglaw> http://fav.me/d561nr2 nice shot by moi
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Saturn: Oh, same thing happens to me I can never get in contact with my friend, then I get paranoid that they are trying to avoid me
<Biglaw> I hate it when that happens ;~;
<Polydunami> You know, Saturn, one time I was flat out rejected by someone I'd developed a crush on.
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> That and the paranoia that everythingin the Omniverse is out to get me.
<Saturn> 08,01EggWhite|DurianTrade: i... did something
<Polydunami> I never developed a crush on anyone since.
<Saturn> 08,01that means i wouldn't be surprised if they wanted to ignore me
<Saturn> 08,01she was hitting on me at LAC
<Saturn> 08,01and i... kinda pulled a guy in front of her
<Polydunami> Oh my
<Saturn> 08,01als, Biglaw, that's a wonderful pic <3
<Biglaw> Saturn :3 thanks
<Biglaw> Wow, a poster of John Lennon has the perfect quote for the picture
<CrazyCherry> Dang navit!

<killerpony7733> Good afternoon everypony :)
<Saturn> 08,01Polydunami: i don't eve know if i'm just being paranoid about this, or she was actually offended by it, to be honest
<Saturn> 08,01i mean
<Saturn> 08,01we were kinda hitting it off
<Saturn> 08,01and maybe quite well
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Afternoon killerpony7733.
<Saturn> 08,01but nothing was said either way about it
<Saturn> 08,01so meh
<Saturn> 08,01i dunno
<Saturn> 08,01maybe she was just pissed off with the party
<MultiStar101> Hi everypony!
<Nin|MightBeSleepin> Heyp.
<Biglaw> Hi MultiStar101!
<Saturn> 08,01i just don't know what to do!
<Saturn> 08,01she was lovely and i really want her as a friend!
<Saturn> 08,01she was really awesome!
<Saturn> 08,01and i don't like the idea of her just... ignoring me forever
<Polydunami> Well, I'm not much of an expert on this kind of an issue.
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Saturn: misa no know I suck at anything to do with socializing.
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Would it be possible to contact her in some other way in order to explain?
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Oh hai MultiStar101
<Saturn> 08,01>friendliest fandom ever
<Biglaw> I think I'm gonna eat something soon
<Saturn> 08,01>everyone claims to suck at socialising
<Polydunami> See, I once had a crush on a girl and she sent me a facebook rejection.
<Kammerjunk> I don't socialise, I entertain.
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: i only have her deviantart and her e-mail
<Biglaw> Polydunami ouch...
<Saturn> 08,01Polydunami: a rejection would be fine! just not ignoring...
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> I do, most people can only get 2 words out of me.
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Sometimes 3
<Polydunami> We were good friends beforehand too.
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: If you never meant to cause her offence, would it then be possible to explain that to her?
<Saturn> 08,01i made up a dirty song about 2 members of the BUCK committee last night
<Biglaw> silly Saturn
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Saturn: BUCK committee?
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: how do i go about it, though? "i'm sorry if i caused you offence by kissing a guy in front of you; if i totally misinterpreted that and you don't care two shits that i did it, ignore this"
<Saturn> 08,01EggWhite|DurianTrade: Brony UK Convention
<Polydunami> It's okay, Biglaw: we worked things out.
<Saturn> 08,01i'll give it a few more days
<Saturn> 08,01maybe she just hasn't seen my message
<Biglaw> Alright, time to eat
<Biglaw> brb
<Saturn> 08,01but... what is this? i mean, am i just worried, or am i actually crushing on her?
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Oh ok wait there is a convention here, I was not informed.
<Saturn> 08,01because ... honestly, i don't want to be, really
<Saturn> 08,01no time for anything like that
<Polydunami> I know how you feel Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01i crush on people to easily
<Polydunami> I was that way once, Saturn.
<Saturn> 08,01it's like it's just an inevitable stage of frienship i go through with everyone i know
<Saturn> 08,01male, female, gay, straight
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> I know how you feel about being ignored, but having a crush on someone, me no know.
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> What about pansexual?
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: I'm sorry, I know this is a serious matter, but you just made me think of the Room.
<Kammerjunk> ...Or asexual.
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: ohai mark, how's your sex life?
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Or polysexual.
<Polydunami> Say what?
<Kammerjunk> You are tearing me apart, Saturn!
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Or better yet Xsexual.
<Saturn> 08,01i'm pan sexual
<Saturn> 08,01i like crockery
<Ghosties> 04Pan sexual, eh? So that means you like personalities
<Polydunami> Did somepony say polysexual?
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Me
<Saturn> 08,01was... that an anti-joke, Ghosties?
<Polydunami> >.>
<Ghosties> 04Dead serious
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Pansexuality for the win!
<Saturn> 08,01oh goddamnit, why do i keep spilling things on myself?
<Ghosties> 04Because you were laughing at me :P
*EggWhite|DurianTrade puts up hand "high five anyone?"
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: sorry, yes, that's what i mean. i like personalities; gender and sexuality largely aren't a factor to me.
*Saturn 08,01hi 5's EggWhite|DurianTrade
<Polydunami> Let's see, having read yaoi manga... Nope. Polydunami is heterosexual.
<Polydunami> Mostly
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Yay!
<Phase4> 00,02Boo Ya
<Saturn> 08,01Polydunami: that's hardly a conclusive test!
<Phase4> 00,02take that game
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Saturn and Ghosties
<Saturn> 08,01Saturn: we need some external corroboration
<Ghosties> 04Ohai Phase
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Corroba-what
<Polydunami> What do you mean by that, Saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01whoops
<Saturn> 08,01Polydunami: we need some external corroboration
<Lil_B> hi everyone
<Saturn> 08,01Polydunami: in whcih case, this is very relevant: http://ompldr.org/vZW1xdA
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Whats corroboration?

<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Hey Lil_B

<Biglaw> Well, I enjoyed that breakfast
<Saturn> 08,01but this coffee is terrible, even for coffee
<Polydunami> Tea > Coffee
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> I like Omnisexual best.
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Omni is best prefix.
<Biglaw> ponies>coffee

<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Misa knows :)
<Saturn> 08,01ah, okay
<Saturn> 08,01i used to have a social circle of lots of Andrews
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> I like using Omnisexual rather then pansexual but pansexual is more commonly used.
<Saturn> 08,01Tall Andrew, Small Andrew, Chinese Andrew, Useless Andrew
<Saturn> 08,01i was known as Unprefixed Andrew
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<Phase4> 00,02this room has no entences
<Phase4> 00,02except the one i made in the wall

<Phase4> 00,02how did the person get stuff in then
<Biglaw> Phase4 it was covered up?
<Phase4> 00,02and why is there a valve in there
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> inb4 damn

<Biglaw> I'm a Derrick
<Phase4> 00,02yup, i'ma andrew
<Polydunami> My brother is an Andrew.
<Saturn> 08,01it's funny when we see each others' terminals
<Biglaw> I'm special, my name is in the dictionary
<killerpony7733> Saturn i think the only one i know that has the name sebastian here is slurrymoon if i'm correct
<Saturn> 08,01when i see his, i think "wait, i'm logged in to *what* machine?"
<Rain> Phase4, because the goo monster lives in there and he travels through the pipes
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: never call any of your machines Hastur
<Saturn> 08,01that'll get confusing
<Phase4> 00,02lol
<Saturn> 08,01or name them after Gibson AIs
<Phase4> 00,02i've still got to name my laptop
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> I'm known as David in IRL.
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> But you can call me blarg.

<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Which one blarg?
<Rain> my name is Rain irl
<killerpony7733> My name is just Sebastian however i am called by a nickname mostly :D
<Saturn> 08,01andrew@hastur:~$ <--- if i see that on someone else's terminal, i'll start to panic
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Polydunami: David highfive!
<Polydunami> /)
<Phase4> 00,02suddenly praxis
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> (/
*Biglaw forever a Derrick

<Polydunami> David /)*(\ David
<Phase4> 00,02lol
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Or brohoof tis all good.
<TrixieBaconMuffin> You can call your computer Mr.Smith , then go find that fanfare from the show and put it as your startup sound. /) to anyone "who" gets that reference.
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> I call my computer Hal
<Biglaw> I need a wake up shower, be back soon
<Polydunami> I've stayed up too long
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Get dermal armor
<Polydunami> I think I will head for bed now. Goodnight everypony!
<TrixieBaconMuffin> get derpy eyes
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, i'm thinking that
<Phase4> 00,02but being a stealth build, dont realy need it
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Night night Polydunami, anti-durian = bad
<Phase4> 00,02cloaking system seems like it'd be more usefull
<Phase4> 00,02then again that uses energy
<Phase4> 00,02too bad it wont recharge more than one battery
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Phase4: don't most things?
<Phase4> 00,02EggWhite|DurianTrade, thing says it uses a lot
<Phase4> 00,023 seconds to consume one cell
<killerpony7733> EggWhite|DurianTrade: Cloak is the most energy consuming of abilities
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Oh ok wow that is alot.
<Chrysalis> Hey guys
<Chrysalis> ahhh, DE:HR
<Phase4> 00,02the upgraded ones will do 7 seconds
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Chrysalis
<Chrysalis> how is everyone?
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Hey Chrysalis how are you?
<Phase4> 00,02allso thinking of getting the typhoon system
<Phase4> 00,02for the lulz
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> I'm good
<Rain> yeah, but imagine the gap that you just needed a small amount of invisiblity to get passed
<killerpony7733> Typhoon is such a silly aug
<Chrysalis> i didnt like the typhoon whn i played
<Chrysalis> leaves you so damn vulnerable
<Phase4> 00,02but explosions
<Rain> but you are stealth
<Phase4> 00,02but explosions
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Yay explosions
<Rain> but stealth
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Phase4> 00,02EggWhite gets it
<Chrysalis> yeah, hes gonne stealth all the way behind them
<Chrysalis> the blow em up
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Explosive /)
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Rain> lol
<Chrysalis> Phase = stealth bomber
<Phase4> 00,02EggWhite|DurianTrade, (\
<killerpony7733> Get a rocket launcher and maybe a grenade launcher
<Phase4> 00,02dem hacking addons would make hacking laughably easy
<killerpony7733> That gives twice as much explosions as typhoon
<Rain> you should upgrade your batteries so you dont have to worry about energy consumption so much
<killerpony7733> :D
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Oh and get a chicken.
<Chrysalis> phase late game they are essential
<Phase4> 00,02theres allso the two at once mele thing
<Chrysalis> that is AMAZING
<killerpony7733> Phase4: That one is very useful
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, thinking about that, but it wont recharge more than one cell
<Rain> wtf
<Phase4> 00,02or will it
<Phase4> 00,02i dont know
<Chrysalis> yeah, no point going for extra cells
<Phase4> 00,02it only recharges one of the two now
<Rain> then upgrade your recharging?
<Phase4> 00,02multi-takedown or batteries?
<Chrysalis> it only ever recharges the first cell available
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Yeah a good idea
<Chrysalis> so if you half use te first cell, itll recharge it
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Phase4 Explosions!
<Chrysalis> but it wont if you completely drain it
<Phase4> 00,02soo tempted to get the typhoon
<Chrysalis> the recharge speed are useful, but pretty much a waste of time to get the batterys
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Do it!
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Make things explode
<Phase4> 00,02multi-takedown is probably a limited use thing
<Phase4> 00,02but the batteries i use a bot
<Phase4> 00,02bit'
<Chrysalis> Phase4 its pretty much everywhere
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Explosions
<Phase4> 00,02i'd allso like the aim stabilizer
<killerpony7733> Yeah it helps get rid of all recoil
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Remove ALL the recoil!
<MadSurge> Fun fact, I always pick stats upgrades instead of flashy moves that do shit damage :D
<Chrysalis> hmmm
<Chrysalis> i might cosplay to BUCK as Brittania
<Chrysalis> should i?
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> Where is BUCK?

<sub06905> Cypresswolf:
<sub06905> looked them up for pony toys?
<Cypresswolf> However, there is one in College Station some 80 miles out - mainly a college town so much more likely to have store exclusives
<CrazyCherry> I gtg now ponies! Bye!
<sub06905> bye CrazyCherry
<Cypresswolf> I have most of the older G4 stuff, grabbing what I can before some disapear when the new wave of ponies hit in August

<Saturn> 08,01 /win 17
<Liokin> -lol for a second I thought that was a marajana bush or something -lol
<Cypresswolf> Although...I did get weird looks from the cashier - that "Aren't you a little old for this" look -
<sub06905> trash next to food? seems legit
<sub06905> Cypresswolf: :D
<EggWhite|DurianTrade> food next to trash
<Chrysalis> Saturn is all the win
<Liokin> sub06905: Atleast they know what there buying.
<Saturn> 08,01indeed
<Saturn> 08,01my god, this weekend was great in terms of getting the committee working together
<Saturn> 08,01everyone is all hyped up now
<Liokin> Saturn: commitee? for what?
<Chrysalis> good to hear Saturn
<sub06905> Got taste mate?
<Chrysalis> is everything coming to gether?
<Cypresswolf> Picture this - Big guy in late 20's with a basket FULL of my little pony toy sets & nothing else at a time where most have just clocked out of work - filling up the conveyour belt with ponies - with several Moms & children behind me
<Liokin> Ducks =D
<sub06905> Cypresswolf: seems legit
<Cypresswolf> Yeah, I can understand those looks
<CountDoofus> Haio, everybrony.
<sub06905> ello CountDoofus
<Liokin> Cypresswolf: -lol well thats one way to test your brony-ness
<XAX|reading> Saturn: Im asking you a question about music. Talk my ears off please.
<XAX|reading> lol
<Cypresswolf> *raises hoof in Victory* /)
<sub06905> (\
<sub06905> the only way i showed my brony-ness is buy wearing mlp shirts
<Liokin> Phase4: Horeee sheet! >:3 you just punch a wall down :D
<sub06905> by*
<Phase4> 00,02that i did
<Cypresswolf> Next week, I'll look for the rest of the vehicles & train car sets
<Cypresswolf> Might even take some out of the box - :O - and ruin the collector's value - :O:O
*Biglaw|iPhone likes his iPhone
<Cypresswolf> Is anyone else tempted to let Derpy Hooves out of her box if they get one?
<sub06905> remote control car for pinkie pie :D
<sub06905> http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11965010
<Kammerjunk> I have never been one for toys, preferring clothing articles and accessories, so what I see in a rare toy is the possibility for monetary gain.
<Kammerjunk> My ability to kill the chat continues to amaze me.
<Cypresswolf> I dont collect for monetary gain - practically everything Ive collected over the years are worth the same if not less than the day I got them - from baseball & comic cards to wrestling figures, and anime figurines
<Cypresswolf> not even the artworks
<Kammerjunk> Cypresswolf: As long as it's a somewhat special item you never throw out, it will eventually become valuable regardless.
<sub06905> i swear his voice reminds me of batman
<DeadpoolDash> I never asked for this...I'm BATMAN!
<Chrysalis> shes wants time in da sack
<Phase4> 00,02>leave no wounds
<Phase4> 00,02>meens no tranq or stun gun
<Phase4> 00,02>punching is k
<Chrysalis> yup
<Phase4> 00,02seems logical
<Chrysalis> cause bruises and broken bones could be from the fall
<Chrysalis> but the drug route, not sure how they explain that
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<Phase4> 00,02plant drugs or throw off building?
<sub06905> hmm..
<sub06905> Phase4: save before you do anything and try both out?
<Phase4> 00,02i doubt theres a difference
<Chrysalis> thers no actual karma system
<Chrysalis> so its which you want to do
<Chrysalis> but i think you get more money for drugs
<sub06905> which ever seems eaiser
<Chrysalis> no tranqa
<Phase4> 00,02wonder if i can do both
<Chrysalis> annoyingly you can't do both
<Phase4> 00,02as in i fail or just doesnt count?
<Chrysalis> doesnt count
<Chrysalis> youll get the drug one
<Chrysalis> well, whiever first
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma google the rewards
<Phase4> 00,02rewards are the same
<Phase4> 00,02"Planting the drugs, then dropping Chan off the roof will fail the mission."
<Phase4> 00,02but dropping him of a roof
<Phase4> 00,02has a chive
<Phase4> 00,02oh, thats a bummer
<Phase4> 00,02cant get pacifist after doing this
<Phase4> 00,02probably failed pacifist anyway
<Chrysalis> you snapped a neck through wall didnt you
<Phase4> 00,02off the roof it is
<Chrysalis> you failed it a long while ago
<Phase4> 00,02right at the begining i had to shoot a few people
<Phase4> 00,02ran out of darts
<Chrysalis> why not beat them
<Chrysalis> he dead
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, wasnt aware of how to do that yet
<Phase4> 00,02might play through again
<Phase4> 00,02might now
<Phase4> 00,02not'
<Chrysalis> i did enjoy the pacifist run
<Chrysalis> far more tactical
<Chrysalis> you can run and gun this far too easy
<Chrysalis> oh hell be satisfied
<sub06905> lol
<Chrysalis> there was no point in that
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02not sure what this is for
<Phase4> 00,02'dirty job'
<Phase4> 00,02take or no take?
<Chrysalis> take it
<Chrysalis> take that dirt
<Phase4> 00,02k

<sergio_scriptor> sub06905: possibly something like the nazy propaganda,just beacsue they dont like it :|

<Meanwhile> The mods.
<timstr117> the admins should let people upload vids if there r no vids showing and no admins to upload
<Meanwhile> Even if they did only a handful of trusted people would be allowed.

<Major_Frank> Lemme get my piano
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> http://dearderpyadvice.tumblr.com/post/26472660304/strawberry-seas-forever-by-the-seaponies
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Its a seapony parody of "Strawberry Seas Forever"
<Meanwhile> Shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo.
<CountDoofus> Strawberry Fields?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> oops yeah, a parody of that
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> thinking a may do a seapony of Elvis, In the Ghetto eventually

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> so what do you guys think of the song?
<timstr117> YAY
<|Discord|> ponies :)
<Meanwhile> If there's anyone here who hasn't seen Epic Pie Time they need to be flogged.
<timstr117> OMG
<twilight_sprinkle> ah, scoot
<|Discord|> anypony u mean?
<CrimsonPhoenix> hey Scoot
<CountDoofus> AMERICA!!
<MegaMoonShine> MURICA!
<timstr117> YES
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Mare-ica
<timstr117> FUCK YEH
<Meanwhile> Meeeeeeeeeeeh. Mute is my friend.
<twilight_sprinkle> ^ hates AMERICA
<timstr117> WE WILL FREE THE SCOODLALOO OUT OF U
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: I really do.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: aw im so proud of you, keep it up
<timstr117> BADASS
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: Not kidding, I think it's the worst first world country in the world.
<|Discord|> Im just drowning in DayZ right now
<timstr117> EPIC SHOW AGAIN
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Bosnia and Horsegovina?
<twilight_sprinkle> ^^^^^^^
<twilight_sprinkle> and serbia
<CountDoofus> DROP THAT!
<CrimsonPhoenix> too tired for dubstep
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: honestly, you need to learn more about other countries
<MegaMoonShine> :O
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Saddlelaide, Australia
<timstr117> onfg i <3 this
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: have you even been to Usa?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> New Zebraland
<timstr117> yay
<MegaMoonShine> Doo doo dooooo doo doodoododoodoodoo
<|Discord|> twilight_sprinkle: I know that america is in a shit ton of debt
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: No, nor do I want to. Everything I can see about your country paints it in negative light.
<twilight_sprinkle> |Discord|: that may be true, but thats not the subject
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> what do you guys think of my song
<Meanwhile> Oh wait twilight_sprinkle have we had this conversation before?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> SMOOTH JAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: lol your opinion is hardly worth anything if you hate a country youve never even been to.
<timstr117> yes but we r coming out of it and china and the other places r going into resesion
<timstr117> so were ok now
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> what about Neighpal?
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: That's like saying I'm not allowed to judge artwork because I'm not a painter. And is incredibly stupid.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: yes we have, although ive been curious whether youve been to the country you hate so much. you havent. pf lol
<Everlasting_Joy> Who's streaming?
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: lol those are entirely different things. the reasoning is that you havent actually seen America other than on TV
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: its like judging a painting off other peoples' reviews
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: without even seeing it
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Casablankflank, Marerocco
<CountDoofus> I've been to America on several occasions. And am always bummed out when going back home.
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: Interesting comparison, but really I don't mind the country, it's the people I dislike. I don't like arrogance and America is so full of itself it's unreal. Probably the reason everyone is so fat.
<timstr117> but were still in iraq so any country fighting in iraq is sorta ok
<|Discord|> Machinaima? Ah...they sucks
<timstr117> money wise
<timstr117> blase men
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: but you havent even had much interaction with americans. yes they are arrogant, but only around the age of 13-22 or so, adult amercians are somewhat nice actually
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: many people are arrogant around that age, not just americans
<timstr117> well i would know i live in america
<MadSurge> :O DONKEY KONG
<MadSurge> O__O
<timstr117> no pause plz
<twilight_sprinkle> ...ok
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: I've talked to plenty of Americans, and I know not all of them are that bad. Just the loud majority. America at large thinks it's better than everyone else, and that ticks me off.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: where, on the internet? everyone is loud on the internet
<timstr117> not really only stupid young kids and red necks
<CountDoofus> Streamer just doesn't know what went wrong...
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: and btw youre very wrong, many americans are pissed at their country
<MadSurge> AMERICA
<timstr117> no mainly at obama
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: Reread the part where I said "I know not all of them are that bad" Since apparently you skipped it.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: americans wise up usually around the college-end period
<timstr117> oh i think i did sry
<|Discord|> twilight_sprinkle: Im sry but what country are you from?
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: thats irrelevant really.
<MadSurge> Retrogame Studios is the new Rare <3
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: youre generalizing, so am i
<twilight_sprinkle> |Discord|: ukraine
<MadSurge> DIE
<|Discord|> twilight_sprinkle: Not only have americans made a bigger and badder country in less time(200years) than anyone else we also have had the best luck withmost things and have made our people happy for a LONG time. In just 200 years. America is the youngest country in the owrld
<|Discord|> t*world
<Spitfire> who's streaming? :2
<MadSurge> Is Scootie streaming?
<Spitfire> :3
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: Also irrelevant. I dislike the way America acts and how it lives and until they actually start doing that differently my mind is pretty set.
<twilight_sprinkle> |Discord|: im not hating on america though
<|Discord|> Everypony does
<Crono_brony> MadSurge: You mean scoot-scootaloo?
<timstr117> yeh none can if u do we got the largest suppply of nukes in the world
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: youre opinions are based on false convictions and lack of experience.
<timstr117> russia second
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: how about you actually go to america.
<MadSurge> Crono_brony: Yep, it's him :D
<Spitfire> yeah its scoots
<timstr117> I LIVE IN AMERICA
<twilight_sprinkle> *your
<MadSurge> RD is so jelly
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: Are you somehow implying that until I go to America my experience with its people isn't valid?
<MadSurge> More, yes!
<timstr117> no
<timstr117> u hav a good idea
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: yep.
<MadSurge> I request the Mortal Kombat one! :D
<Crono_brony> MadSurge: Wait, but looking at the users, i don't even see that he's online!
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: That's just stupid.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: you judge a country without even seeing it firsthand
<timstr117> i live in america
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: i already said why. youre just going around in circles ignoring what i say
<timstr117> im confused
<MadSurge> Crono_brony: he might be streaming without entering the chat just to troll us :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: youre the kind of person who thinks everyone who disagrees with him is stupid and wrong, i already realized that
<Crono_brony> MadSurge: What a trickster!
<MadSurge> ^
<timstr117> no im just saying that that only stupid kids and rednecks think that america is soooo badass
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: Totally untrue. In matters of opinion everyone else /is/ wrong from personal view point. That's how opinion works, but if you can actually prove me wrong then ok, I'm wrong and I have learned. But all you do is say my opinion of America is based on false knowledge which is as inaccurate as your view of me.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: whenever you argue with someone you always make it persona, and often use insults. people do that when they lack ways to prove their point
<MadSurge> timstr117: if you mean "seriously think so", then yes
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: you judge a country without even SEEING it, what would possibly make you think your opinions are worth much?
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: You've never met me, what makes you think your opinion is worth anything?
<timstr117> i live in america so i know what america is like
<Vordox> Okay gotta stop crying
<Vordox> :'(
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: because im not really interested in judgin you, we're talking about a country here.
<MadSurge> Vordox: :O why are you crying?
<Everlasting_Joy> Vordox, what were/are you crying about?
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: and answering a question with a question is another way to avoid using logic
<Vordox> MadSurge: I just imagined a whole flash episode for the final last stand of the alicorns
<Vordox> =P
<timstr117> ALL IM SAYING IS ONLY STUPID KIDS AND REDNECKS SCREEM AMERICA WILL KILL U ALL!!!! WICH IS GAY AS HELL
<Vordox> Imagination flash episode
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: And yet you /are/ judging me in the same way I judge the country. By experience you have gathered from non-direct interaction.
<Vordox> wish I could animate
<twilight_sprinkle> timstr117: yeah, every country has those people
<timstr117> ok disscussion over
<MadSurge> Vampire Rain :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: lol basically right now youre diverging this conversation into blaming me for judging you, which im not.
<Crono_brony> Vordox: same here, i also can't make music. XD
<timstr117> no u not judeing me
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: and even if i Were judging you, that doesnt change anything
<timstr117> r u???/
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: that doesnt mean im wrong about what i said
<Lil_B> hi everyone
<MadSurge> Hey Lil_B!
<Vordox> Crono_brony: The thing is, if I made this into a reality, it would probably one of the most viewed within weeks of most all MP things
<timstr117> yes u arnt wrong
<Vordox> D:
<MegaMoonShine> hi Lil_B :)
<CountDoofus> Haio Lil_B. Grab some popcorn and enjoy the drama.
<JRP2234[Silly_Filly]> yay TELSTRA IS BEING A DICK WITH ME FUCKING inTERNET
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: honestly, youve never had much contact with slavs obviously. talk with serbs about their country, then youll see what real arrogance and nationalism is like
<JRP2234[Silly_Filly]> i swere i want them fired
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: You are, you're criticising me for the way I act in the same manner I do to America. And you're trying to make it look like I'm moving away from the actual issue to make it look like you're more credible.
<MadSurge> This game looks cheap :D
<Vordox> Crono_brony: It would be the equilvalent to the ending of S2, just way better. :P
<timstr117> ALL IM SAYING IS OLY YOUNG KIDS AND REDNECKS THINK SOOO HIGHLY OF AMERICA
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: You're not even talking to me any more, you're more interested in appearing right to everyone else.
<Jim> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pr7fb/
<CountDoofus> Didn't Michael from Roosterteeth play this game on Rage Quit sometime?
<Jim> relevant
<MadSurge> DED
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: see, youre doing what i said, youre making this personal. all i said is that you dont know enough about america. thats all. youre twisting everything else and avoiding convestations about the subject
<StinkomanFan> LOOK OUT FOR ANT
<timstr117> now im confused so lets just stop
<MadSurge> YES :D
<Crono_brony> Trollestia has affected this conversation. DAMMIT TROLLESTIA!
<Jim> Two best friends play is awesome
<MadSurge> This game is so horrible :D
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: ok lets stop here and analyze our conversations. by now youve called me:a twonk, you called my opinions stupid, you said im more interested in appearing right. have i insulted you once? No.
<Everlasting_Joy> "It's not raining men." :D
<timstr117> no
<StinkomanFan> You guys ever see these two LP Silent Hill Downpour
<MadSurge> StinkomanFan: I did
<Jim> nope
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: And now you're appealing to the moral high ground because I'm blunt. In addition, you've said my opinion doesn't matter.
<timstr117> all i was trying to say is only boys and rednecks speak sooo highly of america
<Lil_B> hi MadSurge MegaMoonShine and CountDoofus ;) which drama?
<Ninjazz> I heard this game really sucked.
<StinkomanFan> FORWARD UNTO DAWN
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: lol see, all youre doing is making this persona. you CANT prove your opinion, so you prefer to insult me and avoid the subject
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Meanwhile and twilight_sprinkle are bickering
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: The point of this little exchange isn't to debate America it's to debate your belief that I can't have an opinion of the country because I haven't stood on its soil.
<Everlasting_Joy> For a game that's suppose to be on this generation, it looks like last gen's graphics.
<Crono_brony> Ninjazz: What game? i cant see the stream.
<CountDoofus> Lil_B: twilight_sprinkle and Meanwhile going at each other about whether or not America is full of itself or not.
<timstr117> ok lets ust go with that
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: no, im saying that you shouldnt judge america before youve been there. thats all. how is that bad
<StinkomanFan> Vampires, er.... nightwalkers will fuck you up
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: You're implying that an opinion can be proved, which it can't. That's why it's an opinion and not a fact.
<Ninjazz> Crono_brony, Vampire Rain... i think.
<timstr117> not bad
<Crono_brony> Ninjazz: Thanks! ^^
<Ninjazz> ^_^
<timstr117> if u havent been to a place u shouldnt judge it
<Jim> interface reminds me of metal gear
<Lil_B> CountDoofus oh, I see XD
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: an opinion can always be proved lol. saying "it cant be proved" makes opinions worthless and is just another way to avoid proof
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: Opinions /are/ worthless.
<timstr117> that is a really good point
*MadSurge smacks Meanwhile and twilight_sprinkle's heads with a rolled up newspaper "stop it"
<StinkomanFan> IM'A VAMIYAH
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: lol then keep them to yourself, no need to throw worthless thoughts around
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: You started this debate.
<timstr117> sure
<timstr117> i did
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: not really, you keep expressing your hate towards america
<MadSurge> 1, 2, 3 horrible game mechanics! A A AAA!
<Lil_B> I would like to record such things to give people examples in how to argue/not to argue
<timstr117> i dont mean that sarcasticly
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: and you also complain about racism. lol
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: And you decided to confront me about it. You could have ignored me.
<StinkomanFan> HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY
<MadSurge> ^
<timstr117> true but i didnt
<Lil_B> Whats on the Stream? I'm currently not on the Site XD
<MadSurge> DED
<StinkomanFan> Have some debates about America
<Kammerjunk> StinkomanFan: Happy American-fireworks-played-to-Russian-music day!
<Jim> Vampire Rain Lil_B
<Jim> two bestfriends play more spesificly
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Two Best Friends Play Vampire Rain
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: well i didnt know you just like to form opinions without bothering to prove them, or even give them any value. thanks for telling me your opinions are wortthless,ill ignore you from now on.
<Lil_B> im damnit, an Anime, I must join in an Instant
<StinkomanFan> Stream broke for me
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: although i must say, your very disrespectful towards americans, which can offend americans here, think about that.
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: You appear to not understand what an opinion is so allow me to clarify. Ice is cold, that's a fact. That is a measureable truth. I think ice is tasty. That's an opinion, it is entirely subjective and only holds true to the individual saying it.
<twilight_sprinkle> *youre
<timstr117> ok that is ok. bu tu should never ignor another persons probs even if u think that it doesnt matter
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: cold is relative, bad example.
<timstr117> a lesson tought by twilight sparkle
<Kammerjunk> It really is funny to me that the arguably most American celebration of all celebrations in America comes with 1812 Overture.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: and no, there are facts, and opinions can be proven to be facts
<Everlasting_Joy> timstr117: I was just going to point that out :).
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: scientists had many opinions, some of which were proven to be true
<timstr117> that is true
<StinkomanFan> DEAR PRINCESS CELESTIA, TODAY I LEARNED THAT WE CANNOT HAVE OUR OWN OPINIONS
<Jim> ^
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: In my opinion, ice is cold. And since ice /is/ cold, trying to prove otherwise is just silly. That's why it's a fact.
<timstr117> trolol
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: what if scientists said: yeah we cant prove it, screw this
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: That's a hypothesis, not an opinion.
<Jim> Opinions on the internet? Why I've never
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: again , cold is relative. compared to absolute zero, ice is warm
<Kammerjunk> Everybody's upset.
<timstr117> yes u r correct
<MadSurge> OH DEAR GOD ARE YOU TWO STILL AT IT
<Eagle3302> Flame War!
<timstr117> yes we r
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: well whats the point of having an opinion that you dont want to have value, hence be a hypothesis
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: You're just trying to twist the words because you have no actual response.
<Jim> http://memedepot.com/uploads/2000/2397_bpfobu.jpg
<Kammerjunk> We didn't start the flame war.
<Kammerjunk> Peeps were hating on it 'fore I left my comment.
<StinkomanFan> GOD DAMNIT STREAM, GET TO WORKING
<timstr117> no PIE WAR i got rainbow dash and apple jack :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: omfg youre the one who started this bullshit about words "thats not an opinion, its a hypothesis"!
<StinkomanFan> I WANNA SEE NICHOLAS CAGE BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF SOLID SNAKE
<Crono_brony> Everything was calm and peaceful this morning! Why can it not stay that way?
<timstr117> none use flame as a weapon in mlp
<AttackPony|Zzz> Meanwhile, twilight_sprinkle: Okay, seriously? I just woke up and somehow I can hear your voices in my head even though I've never heard them before.
<Everlasting_Joy> Now we've moved to symantics. That's a great sign for any debate!
<timstr117> exsept 4 dragons
<Ethereal> Hey.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: things are a lot more simple, if you have an opinion, that can be potentially insulting to others, prove your opinions and give them value, otherwise its just selfish insults
<Eagle3302> We are having some Bronies arguing, time to put them into the hugroom! FOREVER!
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: A hypothesis is the predicted outcome of study and experiment, and doesn't always end the way you might believe. An opinion is literally nothing more than personal feelings based on life experience and holds no ground in actual truth.
<CountDoofus> Haio Ethereal */me hands you a bucket of popcorn*
<Kammerjunk> Well, stream is down, so this is very appropriate: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF44JBEC7Ps
*Ethereal eats some of the popcorn
<timstr117> ok lets just stop its getting old
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: an opinion is a thought, not feelings.
<Ethereal> Thanks CountDoofus
<alexxm> hey guys
<Eagle3302> twilight_sprinkle: dedicated flaming XD
<Lil_B> hi alexxm
<Jim> hai alexxm
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: but read my previous comment, im tired of this word definition bullshit
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: Thought based on experience.
<MadSurge> Hey alexxm!
<Crono_brony> Kammerjunk: OMG I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING
<alexxm> hey Lil_B Jim and MadSurge how have you guys been
<Kammerjunk> Crono_brony: Fitting, innit?
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: you have ALMOST NO experience
<CountDoofus> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm1jxC-xtyY
<|Discord|> alexxm: O hai
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: thats what i was saying, you LACK experience to prove this
<CountDoofus> Haio alexxm
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I'll get the good ending next time I play Lollipop Chainsaw :D
<Crono_brony> Kammerjunk: This morning in a nutshell.
<Jim> CountDoofus: OMG excellent !
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: besides, you say you hate AMERICA, the country, because youve talked to some random people and you didnt like them. how is that a good opinion
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: I've been alive for 19 years. And I'm talking about the general experience of life right now, not my personal experience of America.
<Eagle3302> twilight_sprinkle: yoou just ignored everything you saidyourself, and said something that is a random guess. Please stop this...
<Kammerjunk> And because I'm terribly bored since archery was cancelled today, an opinion is "a view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge."
<Kammerjunk> You're welcome.
<CountDoofus> I'm SO going to BroNYCon next year. I don't care if I have to sell a kidney.
<alexxm> hey |Discord| and CountDoofus how have you been
<StinkomanFan> Saturn? Wrek? Some mod?
<Lil_B> alexxm so far so good, worked on a little bit on an Orchestra version of "Art of the Dress" and finished a little Tune I made
<Saturn> 08,01what?
<twilight_sprinkle> Eagle3302: its not a guess,he told me he hasnt been to the country even
<StinkomanFan> Saturn, there's a flame war going on
<timstr117> its getting confuseing so in gunna stop messageing about it
<alexxm> good to hear Lil_B
<MadSurge> Saturn, please save us from the flame war :(
<CountDoofus> Saturn: The drama! Make it sto-ho-ho-hop!
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: From what I have heard and seen and learned, I dislike the country, just because I haven't been to it doesn't render me automatically wrong.
<Chrysalis> Saturn: Aliens
<Saturn> 08,01who is instigating it?
<Eagle3302> pffft, but you don't knowhow many americans he contacted or talked to
<StinkomanFan> Meanwhile and Twilight_Sprinkle Saturn
<Everlasting_Joy> Oh, hey alexxm! I didn't see you come in.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile and twilight_sprinkle.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: like i said, dont hate on a country publicly if you havent even been there
<Lil_B> MadSurge the endings aren't really that diverse in LC :/ I mean the only difference is that mom is a Zombie or not at the end, in 2 Comic Strips :/
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: emphasize on *publicly*
<Saturn> 08,01hey now
<Saturn> 08,01look
<Saturn> 08,01this chatroom exists for a reason
<Saturn> 08,01to chat about stuff on the stream, and be civil and friendly to one another
<Saturn> 08,01if you want to argue, take it elsewhere
<Saturn> 08,01this is not the place
<Saturn> 08,01yes, this may seem hugboxy, but really, this is not the place for insults or flame wars.
<Saturn> 08,01end of line.
<Kammerjunk> And for but a brief moment, the entirety of BronyState held its breath.
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when end of line.
<Eagle3302> I hate this shadeof yellow -_-
*Ninjazz checks the end of the line
<Jim> I love that shade of yellow
<Ninjazz> Eyup. It's the end.
<Jim> Yellow is best pony
<timstr117> well its easy to read
<twilight_sprinkle> thats a shade? looks like simple yellow
<Eagle3302> true
<MadSurge> I like bright yellow :)
*Chrysalis hugs Saturn
<Meanwhile> Every colour is a shade.
<CountDoofus> And all was well in the land of Equestria.
<Eagle3302> bright yellow ftw
<timstr117> agree bright yellow
<AttackPony|Zzz> I just like bright-ass colors
<Kammerjunk> I like yellow. It's noticable on a black background.
<MadSurge> ^
<Crono_brony> that's dandellion yellow
<Eagle3302> so is aany other bright colour
<Meanwhile> Bright yellow, lemon yellow, autumn yellow...etc.
<Kammerjunk> ...Green?
<Eagle3302> green is good
<Jim> http://www.geekinheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/how_men_and_women_see_colors.jpg
<Saturn> 08,01i'd like to point out that everyone will see the yellow as a different shade, depending on what client/os/terminal you're using
<Sumica> 00,10inb4 color flamewar
<AttackPony|Zzz> I love neon colors~
<MadSurge> Also whoever was streaming killed it :/
<CountDoofus> Chocobo yellow...
<Kammerjunk> Red is best colour.
<MadSurge> Hey Sumica :D
<CountDoofus> Haio Sumica
<Meanwhile> Allo Sumica.
<AttackPony|Zzz> Morning, Sumica
<Eagle3302> Deep Blue
<Eagle3302> Ocean Blue
*AttackPony|Zzz AttackWithHugs
<Saturn> 08,01also, that yellow is probably my least favourite colour
<Eagle3302> XD
<timstr117> well it stands out
<CountDoofus> Pink is best color. Because Pinkie Pie.
<Jim> ^
<Sumica> 00,10at leaset it's not green. Greeen is not a creative color.
<Eagle3302> you ment Purple right?
<AttackWithHugs> CountDoofus: Pink is best color because it's pink.
<MadSurge> My fav color is purple, but Pinkie is still best pony
<Barbetos|AtWork> wut?
<alexxm> so the newsletter still acting up?
<MadSurge> Hey AttackWithHugs!
<Jim> purple is cool
<AttackWithHugs> Though I have started getting other colors in my closet lately....
<Jim> Like to wear purple clothes
<AttackWithHugs> Morning, MadSurge
<CountDoofus> What time is it in the US, btw?
<Bronysith> CountDoofus: for me it is 11

<MadSurge> Eagle3302: you british?

<Meanwhile> Eagle3302: /) For Britishness.
<Kammerjunk> The only online MLP game I know is in progress is Tales of Equestria or whatever it's called.
<Kammerjunk> Wasn't MLP Online cancelled, anyway?
<StinkomanFan> Kammerjunk, the beta was released yesterday
<Kammerjunk> oh

<Sumica> 00,10Kammerjunk, a beta for it came out yesterday. altho the online part should be in quotes
<MasterBoss43> StinkomanFan, just go to program files and search/ or program files86/ or whatever, if it dont work dont tell me, if it work tell me.
<Meanwhile> Eagle3302: Close enough.jpg
<Eagle3302> XD
<Irish_Pony> http://monopoly907.deviantart.com/#/d55tk6i MERICA
<Kammerjunk> I just remember some guy working on it being on BronyState and saying that some bad stuff happened.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah the team fell apart and the game split in to two games.
<alexxm> Kammerjunk i think i remember that as well
<Barbetos|AtWork> bronystate? Bad stuff? wut?
*Bronysith sits on Sumica
<Sumica> 00,10oi, I am not a sofa

<StinkomanFan> They're working on it Sumica
<Eagle3302> Thats it! :)
<Kammerjunk> Eagle3302: It's in "pre-alpha", though.
<AttackWithHugs> Barbetos|AtWork: I'll kick him to Venus.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Not even the moon.
<CountDoofus> Kammerjunk: Last I heard, they moved on to beta.
<Barbetos|AtWork> No luna for you Bronysith
<Kammerjunk> oh
*Bronysith sits on Barbetos|AtWork
<Vordox> Someone here wanted a MLP online game?
<Sumica> 00,10I just dont see an indi group able to support an online server. Best I see is small local hosted shards of 6 players
<AttackWithHugs> Barbetos|AtWork: Forget the moon, I'ma kick him somewhere that has sulfuric acid.
<Eagle3302> Kammerjunk: It looks interesting...
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: speaking of which, does Equestria think about other planets/aliens? :D
<Kammerjunk> Sumica: I agree. And there's no way Hasbro would let them gain enough money off the game to support itself.
<Sumica> 00,10only in the HiE fics MadSurge
<FlareChaser> Good morning everypony, or hello if it isn't the morning for you~
<Jim> hai FlareChaser
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: You know.....I don't know. They might be afraid at first because they've never seen anything from another planet before. But on the other hand, it depends on what the aliens' intentions are.
<Everlasting_Joy> Morning FlareChaser.
<CountDoofus> Haio FlareChaser
<AttackWithHugs> Morning, FlareChaser .
<Vordox> You all want an online....hur hur hur....
<CrimsonPhoenix> no stream?
<Vordox> Oh wait, college stuff...DAMNIT
<Jim> eenope
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/LZOXxtXFIOc
<Kammerjunk> I mean, it'd be awesome if Hasbro let the MLP Online team charge money for it to support their servers, but I doubt that'd happen.
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: maybe all aliens are ponies :D
<Sumica> 00,10Sorry cant stream atm, still Shuffeling files for friday.
<FlareChaser> Ah yes, I have such good friends here~
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: Maybe, maybe not. I guess it'll depend which planet they came from.
*Bronysith sits ontop of FlareChaser
<Kammerjunk> But yeah, it could work if it wasn't an MMORPG. If you could team up like in Diablo 2 or something.
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: or it turns out that ponies are aliens and Earth is just around the corner :D
<Ninjazz> inb4 everyday I'm shufflin

<Sylandest> Ninjazz: :O
<Ninjazz> And hey there, CrazyCherry.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Wel I just got outta the shower so I totally have an excuse.
<CriticKitten> :p
<AttackWithHugs> Hi, CrazyCherry
<CountDoofus> Encountered a Final Fantasy-like fight in MLP Online. Did not expect.
<FlareChaser> Nice :P
<CountDoofus> Also, /glomp VioletVanilla
<MadSurge> CountDoofus: :D
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Fair enough, you're excused.
<CriticKitten> Ah, MLP Online. That game cheated me something fierce.
<MadSurge> Ohai VioletVanilla! :$
<VioletVanilla> 06c:
<VioletVanilla> 06MadSurge~
<Sylandest> CrazyCherry: they tell me I missed out on seeing you come back...but now you're here! :) Where've you been?
<CrazyCherry> Sylandest: Sorry... My mom has me on my toes. She says I have a Compyuter free month, that we agreed on, which we never agreed on...
<CriticKitten> Threw me in a fight against five parasprites and a cave bat (who apparently had decided to take up residence in a sunny field during the day time) who liked to wander over and take a chomp out of my pony's health bars.
<Sylandest> CrazyCherry: ooooh....that bites. Did you find a way around it?
<CriticKitten> I had to run after AJ went down. :(
<alexxm> CrazyCherry rel
<CrazyCherry> alexxm: I'm good.
<Vordox> WEird...why did POnychat crash?
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Zubat. Nopony is safe.
<alexxm> i don't think so Vordox
<Vordox> it did
<Vordox> The server didn't respond
<CrazyCherry> Bronysith: I'm good, bro.
<Bronysith> CrazyCherry: that is good
*Bronysith hugs CrazyCherry
*Bronysith uses magic to turn CrazyCherry into a cherry slushie
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: He was like Zubat on steroids man. The paraspites dealt, like, ten damage per turn at most. Cave bat? Twenty damage per attack round. So between him and the sprites I was taking something like 40-50 damage per turn. >_>
<CrazyCherry> Sylandest: Right now, she's not home, so I'm here.
<CountDoofus> And MLPO crashed. Awww :(
*Sylandest hugs CrazyCherry "Well, we're happy to have you back :)"
<CriticKitten> So I was like "lol no" and ran
*CrazyCherry hugs Bronysith before turning into a slushie.
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Ouch. :s crackhead Zubat.

*Bronysith gives Meanwhile a CrazyCherry slushie
<Vordox> HOW MUCH PINKIE PIE Fan are you!? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i-wtiZmso
<FlareChaser> Zubat? ah the memories of throwing my Pokemon Emerald against the wall after too many Zubat encounters~
<CriticKitten> I was like "how is that fight fair? I'm Lvl 1, man, cut my fillies some slack"
<Meanwhile> No thanks, I hate cherry.
<alexxm> CrazyCherry did you get rhe newsletter this week?
<Meanwhile> alexxm: Newsletter is still busted.
<alexxm> thanks Meanwhile
<CrazyCherry> Sylandest: I feel bad though... She yells at me for this and takes this as playing a videogame....
<CrazyCherry> alexxm: In what country do you live in?
<alexxm> CrazyCherry england
<Sylandest> CrazyCherry: Nonsense, there's no reason to feel bad! She doesn't understand is all. I'm pretty sure I'm no video game, hehe
<Bronysith> CrazyCherry: i live in north america

<MadSurge> FlareChaser: you think zubats are bad? Black and White have stupid rock monsters that NEVER die in one hit, so they always get one attack in
<FlareChaser> Oh god @_@
<Meanwhile> Zubat without a one hit kill. That's just evil.
<FlareChaser> Pokemon...
<Vordox> YAY Barbetos Moonstuck
<FlareChaser> Why you gotta do this? D:
<CrazyCherry> Sylandest: She takes everything I do on here as a videogame I play. Even if I would be doing homework or work on here...
*FlareChaser buys 999 Max Repels

<MadSurge> FlareChaser: their special ability is "survive to one hit kills with 1 hp left
*Bronysith eats MadSurge ontop of Meanwhile s moustache
<Sylandest1> hate it when my chat derps
<CriticKitten> That's not much of a special ability.
<FlareChaser> Bronysith: wat.
<CriticKitten> "Die Less"
<Jim> only three things are infinite. The universe, human stupidity and Zubats in a dark cave.
<StinkomanFan> MadSurge, what would their cutiemarks look like?
<Jim> - Abraham Lincon
*Meanwhile throws Bronysith into a skip full of rusty needles.
<Vordox> Oh oh StinkomanFan You wanna do this the HARD WAY!
*Bronysith uses magic to levitate back ontop of Meanwhile s head
<StinkomanFan> No thank you Vordox, I don't swing that way
<MadSurge> StinkomanFan: I 'unno, a crashed controller? :D

*User0 ameri-nuzzles Scoot-Scootaloo.
<FlareChaser> Scoot-Scootaloo is now GLaDOS.

<Kammerjunk> Scoot-Scootaloo: Were you listening to 1812 Overture?
*Everlasting_Joy salutes Scoot-Scootaloo.

<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, it's that Russian song everyone in America listens to.
<MadSurge> This song rocks.
<AttackWithHugs> What Russian song?
<Kandarihu> A collaborative Kerbal rocket?
<hen3ry> this song. 1812 Overture is Russian
<Kammerjunk> AttackWithHugs: 1812 Overture by Piotr Tchaikovsky.
<Sumica> 00,10Russa lost the rights to the song when they lost to cold war.
<AttackWithHugs> Kammerjunk: Oohh okay
<StinkomanFan> I thought we lost the Cold War
<Kammerjunk> Sumica: Still pretty ironic.
<MadSurge> Classic music rocks ^__^
<Ninjazz|Semi-Away> Russia lost the cold war when Rocky kicked that one guy's ass.
<Kandarihu> Kammerjunk, there is a certain love of classical music in the USA. It's not just this song.
<Sumica> 00,10kinda shamefull they lost a war of cold seeing as they all live in it so much
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Tchaikovsky turned to an American after the Soviet Union dissolved [citation needed]
<StinkomanFan> Hey! Boris Beterlov wasn't russian!
<Kammerjunk> No one lost the cold war, M.A.D. doctrine.
<StinkomanFan> He was Pottslovanian
<hen3ry> It was part of Operation Paperclip. Right?
<Scarlet> I wanna see the youtube comments for this vid.
<StinkomanFan> Get yer damned facts straight
<StinkomanFan> A canadian cartoon with russian music being used to celebrate America
<Sumica> 00,10Nah they lost it that's why they have mc donalds over there now. it's part of the terms of the loss.
<MadSurge> This opera is so badass it's got cannons in it! CANNONS!
<MadSurge> HERE WE GO
<Kandarihu> StinkomanFan, it's at least as much American as it is Canadian.
<Kammerjunk> StinkomanFan: Was Pottsylvania a communist or socialist nation?
<Scarlet> Drop that bass
<Bronysith> THIS SONG was on V for VEndetta when he sploded everything
<AttackWithHugs> I feel gentlemanly now....and I'm a female
<StinkomanFan> We need to open #Vinyl_Scratch again...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, of course
<StinkomanFan> Seriously
<Bronysith> StinkomanFan: this is an american cartoon
<Sumica> 00,10that's a canadian cartoon funded by an american company with russian music being used to celebrate America

<alexxm> Biglaw whats the matter
<Kandarihu> If they want to make a mecha game about the American government, it should be some sort of RTS game, where ordinary citizens start building homebrew mecha or something.
<Biglaw> alexxm there have bee brighter days
<FlareChaser> I am back :3
<Biglaw> And the dog that my mom took when she left died :(

<CriticKitten> Sumica: I tried the browser demo of that game, and....I didn't like its combat, honestly. Which was supposedly the big advertising point of it. :/ I just like GW2's combat much better.
<CriticKitten> MR PRESIDENT

<Sumica> 00,10eh to each there own. I am still just trying it my self.

<Irish_Pony> http://fav.me/d562zbx AMERICA
<alexxm> rejected
<CriticKitten> Sumica: Yeah. It just feels awkward to me, but it's probably because I played GW2 first so I'm used to moving and casting at the same time. And TERA refuses to let you do that.
<MadSurge> SUCK ON MY MISSILE PAWWWWWWNCH
<CriticKitten> So it was weird.
<StinkomanFan> :O
<alexxm> who made kamina president
<AttackPony> "MISSLE PUNCH"
<Kammerjunk> Sumica: What's the MMO called?
<MadSurge> Dat Guile theme
<StinkomanFan> DAMN YOU HANDICAPS
<MadSurge> Matt won <3
<CriticKitten> It's like they tried to hybridize standard MMO combat and action-adventure.
<ACS13123> And NO MINECRAFT
<MadSurge> ^
<CriticKitten> Kammer: Sumica's talking about TERA.
<Bronysith> http://hunch89.deviantart.com/#/d55twv0
<Kammerjunk> Oh, are we talking about TERA?
<Scarlet> They have more than 20k videos.
<Kammerjunk> I kind of liked TERA.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Ze outtakes
<alexxm> why isn't metal wolf chaos in super robot wars
<CriticKitten> One of the "big three" MMOs coming out, along with TOR and GW2.
<Major_Frank> Evenin' everypony :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Also America
<Bronysith> Sumica: how is tera so far? i heard the combat is good but otherwise it is average mmo
<AttackPony> evening, Major_Frank
<Kammerjunk> CrimsonPhoenix: I kind of liked TERA.
<alexxm> hey Major_Frank hows your day been
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kammerjunk, that's good to know
<Major_Frank> Hot. alexxm
<CriticKitten> Bronysith: you can test the game out in a browser, actually.
<Major_Frank> Really really..
<CrimsonPhoenix> but I doubt you were talking to me
<CriticKitten> Personally it wasn't my thing.
<Major_Frank> Hawt
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: really? link please cause i cant find it
<Kammerjunk> CrimsonPhoenix: I wasn't, sorry. goddammittabkey
<alexxm> why isn't metal wolf chaos in super robot wars
<CrimsonPhoenix> double tab key
<Sumica> 00,10lol dont know still trying to make a charicter
<Kandarihu> I'd like to suggest streaming Tribes: Ascend. But besides not being allowed to make requests like that at all, the game servers are divided into regions.
<CrimsonPhoenix> tab has nothing to do with it you just went too fast
<Kammerjunk> CrimsonPhoenix: No, it was the tab key!
<Kammerjunk> I'm innocent!
<CriticKitten> Bronysith: http://tera.enmasse.com/demo
<Kandarihu> It sure is fun, though.
<MadSurge> AMERICA
<StinkomanFan> >MFW Dudly Do Right had an episode about a coming out party
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: ty mao
<Kammerjunk> Honestly, I expected more character customization options in TERA.
<CriticKitten> As for the game itself, it's kinda average overall. Combat honestly doesn't feel that fluid to me and I don't like it.
<FlareChaser> hmm
<CriticKitten> And the rest of the game is basically WoW from what I can tell.
<CriticKitten> Same quest system.
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Sure, but different combat system.
<Major_Frank> LAUGHTER
<CriticKitten> Yeah, the combat's supposedly the big draw.
<MadSurge> Pat is dying there :D
<CriticKitten> But....I definitely like GW2's combat better. >_>
<CriticKitten> It's just more fluid. I like moving and attacking.
<Kammerjunk> I didn't play GW2, so I couldn't tell.

<Kammerjunk> BaconMane: So delicious,.
<MadSurge> ^
<ACS13123> ^^
<CriticKitten> Controls are pretty different. WASD movement, right mouse button controls the camera, and you either left-click skills to use them or use number keys.
<CriticKitten> (for GW2)
<CriticKitten> TERA's control scheme is different enough that it took me a while to get acquianted.

<Major_Frank> Ouch
<ACS13123> o,o
<alexxm> why would you give the hulk access to giant robots
<MadSurge> alexxm: because stupid awesome :D
<Kammerjunk> DarkStar: Please at least click "Full-size image" first.
<DarkStar> ok
<alexxm> MadSurge he causes enough damage as is imagine what he'd do with a mech
<Kammerjunk> But Zecora in socks is neat. I have never seen that before.
<MadSurge> alexxm: split Earth :D
<CriticKitten> But TERA's combat was pretty decent, I'll admit, it's just not my flavor. *shrug*
*FlareChaser places a chicken on Bronysith
<Major_Frank> Beautyfull..
<Major_Frank> ART
<Kammerjunk> I definitely prefer TERA's combat over, say, WoW's. But really, my MMO of choice is EVE Online.
<RyunosukeKnT> indeed Kammerjunk
<FlareChaser> the only MMO I really liked was WoW, everything else seems to bore me.
<CriticKitten> Like I said, probably would've liked TERA's combat better if I hadn't tried GW2 first. But I was so used to the latter that it was so hard to adjust and enjoy it.
<StinkomanFan> >MFW Gilda and SS/DT have the same level of meanness
<StinkomanFan> According to Hasbro
<CriticKitten> WoW wasn't my thing. Can't convince myself to pay monthly for a game.
<StinkomanFan> Everypony knows DT's the anti-christ
<Scarlet> EVERYPONY GET ON WELOVEFINE!
<MadSurge> SAVE IT
<FlareChaser> Scarlet: why?
<Ginger> Is this some sort of Gundam Seed?
<MadSurge> SAVE THE STATUE!
<Major_Frank> LICK THE STATUE
<Scarlet> Putting in MLP4TH will get you 25% off all mlp items.
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, it's Tara Strong.
<Ginger> I'm confused on what just happened...
<CriticKitten> XD
<MadSurge> SUDDENDLY TARA
<CountDoofus> Suddenly Tara Strong.
<FlareChaser> Merica.
<ACS13123> aww shii merica
<twilight_sprinkle> ;,.p
<twilight_sprinkle> OD.p
<twilight_sprinkle> io]\
<Chrysalis> suddenly queen
<twilight_sprinkle> ]sry
<FlareChaser> Scarlet: so, why am I on here?
<Kammerjunk> Tara Strong is awesome. So supportive.
<StinkomanFan> Celestia's just looking at the letter like, "WTF?"
<alexxm> the brony queen has spoken
<Major_Frank> Twilight Sparkle is now Obama
<StinkomanFan> BARACK OPONA
<derpy_pony> she looks tired and bored

*Biglaw is Canadian
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Happy 4th of July everyone!
<Kammerjunk> derpy_pony: I don't think she lives in New York. It must also be tiring to be stuck there for the entire BroNYCon.
<GarrettBrony> BUCK YEAH
<alexxm> thanks for the stream Scoot-Scootaloo
<Kammerjunk> Scoot-Scootaloo: Happy fireworks day!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Have an MLG AMERICAN day!
<GarrettBrony> PONIES.... FUCK YEAH
<StinkomanFan> FUCK YEAAAA
<FlareChaser> Fuck yeah!

<GarrettBrony> Ponies!
<Kammerjunk> I forgot why Americans celebrate the 4th of July, so happy fireworks day.
<Ginger> Fuck yeah!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Tara Strong say's so!
<GarrettBrony> BOOKS FUCK YEAH!
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk because we brits decided we couldnt be bothered with the americans any more
<Kammerjunk> I fucking love books.
<Biglaw> I was about to say Super-Scoot64
<Chrysalis> so we let em go
<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis: Fair 'nuff,
<StinkomanFan> Gimme a second I remembered this one really good shoop
<Ginger> Queen Chrysalis is British!? o.o
<Chrysalis> Ginger but of course
<FlareChaser> So, what has more more items, RedBubble or Welovefine?
<Kammerjunk> English accent, American accent, it's all Greek to me.
<Ginger> I thought she was Jeremy irons
<CriticKitten> lol sale hasn't even started and Welovefine's site is already dying. XD
<Kammerjunk> FlareChaser: I assume RedBubble, but I'm not certain. Do you live in the UK?
<Chrysalis> FlareChaser red bubble has more i think, but we love fine gets money back to hasbro
<hen3ry> Bronies are the internet's manual DDOS
<Chrysalis> AFAIK
<FlareChaser> Kammerjunk: No, but I have ordered from RedBubble.
<pony_9312> FlareChaser: we love fine is much higher quality though :P
<Ginger> So! What's next?
<Kammerjunk> FlareChaser: Alright. Well, as far as I know, the biggest difference is the way RedBubble and WeLoveFine imprint stuff on their T-shirts.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good afternoon everyone
<FlareChaser> Alright, well lets see welovefine barely has any Octavia shirts...
<Ginger> So, who else found it rather silly to see how many other ponies they could meet as fillies?
<FlareChaser> Let me check RedBubble..
<Major_Frank> TheHreatAndPowerfullT Hiya! :)
<Bronysith> hmmmm
<sergio_scriptor> hi guys :)
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: hi there
<Bronysith> tera is interesting
<FlareChaser> http://www.redbubble.com/people/calamity/works/8286851-assassins-creed-bronyhood Hell yeah.
<Cobellanez> Hello everyone
<Bronysith> probably sucks because i cant read anything
<StinkomanFan> What was the code for Pony discounts?
<cachi01> RESIDENT EVIL 6 IS AWEEEEEEESOME
<CriticKitten> Bronysith: What do you think of combat?
<hen3ry> StinkomanFan: MLP4TH is what was said earlier I think
<Kammerjunk> WeLoveFine does something (I'm very technical-like, as you can hear) to it so that the motive is seperate from the T-shirt. However, this also means that you should wash it seperately in lukewarm water.
<CountDoofus> INB4 WLF servers crash.
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: well its hard to tell really. i mean definetly more fun than wow combat
<Kammerjunk> As far as I know, RedBubble just puts it straight on the T-shirt.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oh god i can't feel my arms ...
<hen3ry> StinkomanFan: confirmed via EQD
<CriticKitten> Bronysith: Agreed there, but it all felt sort of clunky to me
<hen3ry> however the sale starts at 12 Pacific, 25 minutes from now
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: definetely not buying it though
<cachi01> FlareChaser: do you know if the ship to mexico?
<CriticKitten> Like they were halfway towards a good idea but didn't commit
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<cachi01> FlareChaser: i want that shirt
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: i am never doing montly subsription gaming
<alexxm> hey GilDash hows your day been
<FlareChaser> cachi01: Bleh, its not for sale...
<Unnr> Haiii alll!
*FlareChaser mad.
<GilDash> alexxm: Same old, same old. :)
<Kammerjunk> Meh. I have 2 Dashie T-shirts, a Luna T-shirt and a Twilight necklace. I don't need any more swag this month.
<cachi01> FlareChaser: FUUUUUUU
