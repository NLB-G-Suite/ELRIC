<NightSeas> 02yep
<Aurora> 6what of it
<Welsh_Pony> night
<Dark92Enigma> Goodbye Scoot-Scootaloo, (brohoof)
<junh1024-XD> well, gaming in general
<drfsupercenter> 03but while you're here, I burned you that Song of the South bootleg
<TheRainbowDash> Hope I did not make everypony in the chat awkward during that reading.LD
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Aurora> 6I see a bunch about programming
<Yahooz> here imma be back soon. imma switch to my ipad
<TheRainbowDash> :D
<Biglaw> I happen next
<Aurora> 6not animation
<Biglaw> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03NightSeas never makes sense
<Aurora> 6oh thanks drf
<drfsupercenter> 03just ignore him
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<junh1024-XD> artists, programming, salaries/pay
<NightSeas> 02animation can get you a job in the gaming industry if someone wants to do that
<HeroBrine_theBrone> For 15 cents a day you can feed a african. They eat pennies
<Aurora> 6I told my friend about it, he's like "dude we're watching that when you get it"
<ponies47> lol
<RaveBrony> :D
<Aurora> 6so yep
<Biglaw> .....
<NightSeas> 02that's all I said
<twilight_sprinkle> HeroBrine_theBrone: lol
<Videofreak1127> that's not funny
<Aurora> 6uh
<junh1024-XD> shes aiming for dreamworks iirc
<TheRainbowDash> HeroBrine_theBrone: Hahaha:D
<Aurora> 6"can get you"
<drfsupercenter> 03NightSeas is basically saying that pirating games is going to prevent the people who make games from making money
<CCCP> banana power!
<Aurora> 6HA
<HeroBrine_theBrone> :D
<KJBrony> ...well
<drfsupercenter> 03when all you're actually hurting is the CEOs and such
<Biglaw> clever brony....
<Aurora> 6the video game industry is the hardest field to get into
<drfsupercenter> 03as the programmers and artists are already paid in advance before the games come out
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<ponies47> Taste the Rainbow
<drfsupercenter> 03and heck
<NightSeas> 02that's why I said can
<Dark92Enigma> MUTHABUCKA
<junh1024-XD> for indie devs tat might work differently
<Dark92Enigma> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03you know how Sony is one of the most obnoxious companies about anti-piracy?
<TheRainbowDash> Aww yeah, lick it too.
<PonySwagg> We need Android Poni
<CCCP> no STEREAM?
<Aurora> 6sure
<HyperMetalLugia> ubisoftt
<drfsupercenter> 03The fact that some high-up at Sony admitted that they make money from people buying PSPs just to hack them and pirate games (as I did)
<ponies47> NO THAT JOKE IS OLD
<CCCP> let the links flow in
<HeroBrine_theBrone> videofreak1127: Yes it is :P
*CupcakeWarrior licks TheRainbowDash
<drfsupercenter> 03definitely proves my point
<Videofreak1127> does anyone remember Code Lyoko from a long time ago
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<pikorar> Not yet. Hold your horses.
<EpicPwnTime> heres my favorite part of the stream
<Gunthler> TheRainbowDash: The parts that you played in the story seemed good :D
<CCCP> ohai CupcakeWarrior *glomps*
<TheRainbowDash> Great, everypony thinks Dash(me) is a well, whore..:D
*CupcakeWarrior is glomped
<Aurora> 6oh I remember that
<RaveBrony> Awww
<Derpy_Hooves> oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh WERE HALF WAY THERE~
<drfsupercenter> 03<junh1024-XD> for indie devs tat might work differently <- I know. But I'm talking about console games for the most part
<NightSeas> 02Drf, what happens when sales aren’t good? They start firing people and not hiring new people
<junh1024-XD> I bought a PS3 to copy SACDs ( ¬‿¬)
<Dken2021> I've always loved buffering: the animation
<drfsupercenter> 03I buy all the Humble Indie Bundles
<Alister> Guys ! I'm taking on my BIGGEST challenge yet !
<Shizuka> 13WHOOOOOA
<TheRainbowDash> I know.....that story was too awkward.

<drfsupercenter> 03for that reason
<Shizuka> 13LIVIN ON A PRAAAAYEEER

<otakon> it's over
<Digit|Busy> whew
<Dark92Enigma> Alister THERE'S no stream <----- at the moment
<EpicPwnTime> no stream!
<drfsupercenter> 03well it comes down to this. Piracy doesn't actually hurt them because naive people like you, NightSeas will always buy games and keep them in business
<HeroBrine_theBrone> I always used to cry when i laughed and then i was raped by a clown
*drfsupercenter hides
<Shizuka> 13canary wub wub
<Randomnerd> PREPARE FOR AWESOMENSS!

<Shizuka> 13also i believe val is setting up next
<ponies47> Next brony please
<drfsupercenter> 03-o
<TheRainbowDash> Shizuka: In replace for the Derpy intermission in Movie night, should be a singing session by you mods!:)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so, anyone here like Soundgarden?
<CupcakeWarrior> I do
<Lawlz> And why der no be stream?
<Aurora> 6sales aren't good, fire people, less money produced, less sales, repeat cycle
<RaveBrony> O.o
<LadyCanary> I DO I DO I DO
<NightSeas> 02true
<drfsupercenter> 03and people who wouldn't ordinarily buy it anyway get to enjoy it
<HeroBrine_theBrone> I do
<TheRainbowDash> SaxyPretender: Aww yeah!
<otakon> WELL SON OF A BITCH!
<drfsupercenter> 03I see no downside
<Litwick> Don't even THINK about changing Derpy.
<Aurora> 6that is a foundation in econimics
<otakon> GUESS WHAT!?
<HeroBrine_theBrone> Sound garden and nirvana
<drfsupercenter> 03most games I just refuse to pay for
<SaxyPretender> 0,14LEVEL UP
<Randomnerd> William Shatner is Iron Man
<drfsupercenter> 03if I can't pirate it, I won't play it
<CupcakeWarrior> otakon: Shipping time?
<Aurora> 6*economics
<otakon> Pirate Bay is now BLOCKED by UK ISP's.
<drfsupercenter> 03so me pirating it doesn't actulaly hurt them
<RaveBrony> Bye Scoot-Scootaloo!! Thanks for streaming and reading! :)
<LadyCanary> Saxy gained +1 saxiness.
<Alister> Dark92Enigma : But why would you wanna watch the Nostalgia Critic ? It can't possibly be good for your brain
<SaxyPretender> 0,14because the new Soundgarden song is amazing
<drfsupercenter> 03it just benefits me and that's all
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Gunthler> CCCP: Ponified version :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8nKEQa_gDs&feature=related
<TheRainbowDash> Litwick: But a singing session by the mods would be awesome!
<Lawlz> If somepony could just buy me an awesome computer, I could do the stream so we wouldn't have to sit here.
<Randomnerd> Booo UK
<Litwick> NOPE
<Aurora> 6the overlying fact is that pirating will always happen.
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Randomnerd> Don't be like Murrica :(
<Biglaw> Hey everypony wanna know something weird?
<Aurora> 6the percentage lost in pirating is SO INSIGNIFICANT
<otakon> http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/117001-Court-Orders-UK-ISPs-to-Block-Pirate-Bay
<Dark92Enigma> Alister In your point of view, at least.....
<Lawlz> Ur face!
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<Aurora> 6that all of this is ridiculous
<Sir_lockpicker> no u
<Biglaw> -_-
<CupcakeWarrior> otakon: lol its about time
<Randomnerd> Your face.
<CCCP> Gunthler: you win all of my loves
<Lawlz> Problem, Biglaw?
<Aurora> 6do you actually stop to look at how much money these peple get
<TheRainbowDash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVCFV7jT9ho Almost 3.4 million views everypony!:)
<drfsupercenter> 03And instead of fighting piracy, companies need to realize people want stuff for cheaper and actually stop overcharging
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N132JqqWhHo&feature=related O_o
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: wait, your supporting it?
<Randomnerd> Yer FACE!

<EpicPwnTime> lets play a gAme!

<Alister> Dark92Enigma : It is a scientific fact that watching most of the people on TGWTG or Blistered Thumbs can only make your life worse
<Aurora> 6kinda
<NightSeas> 02[20:07] <Aurora> do you actually stop to look at how much money these peple get <-- yes, and it's a lot
<drfsupercenter> 03Give people what they want, rather than making it annoying for people who actually buy software
<CCCP> Dken2021: :o

<Alister> twilight_sprinkle : We never saw anyone gay so I'll just say idk
<drfsupercenter> 03the copies wouldn't be

<SaxyPretender> 0,14Keep it in English, please, Thrackerzod
<Randomnerd> "Oh, now you're doing it on purpose"
<drfsupercenter> 03how much does a 25-digit serial number cost? Like nothing
<junh1024-XD> its legit, but against the EULA
<PonySwagg> CCCP: Do not want.
<HeroBrine_theBrone> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GggY4TEYbk&feature=related almost forgot my daily watch

<drfsupercenter> 03yeah screw the EULA
<otakon> LadyCanary: how are you today dear?
<CCCP> pony_300: lol
<drfsupercenter> 03it says it's legit for personal use
<drfsupercenter> 03didn't say who
<Dken2021> Lawlz demanding a stream. remember, they just do this whenever thety feel like it, they don't have to stream every weekday
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<junh1024-XD> therefore, unethical or illegal
<Darkts3> SaxyPretender: lol he's thrackerzod
<Alister> Lawlz : No cuz my other game took long I did pacifist with every secondary missions
<drfsupercenter> 03dude how is it unethical
<Lawlz> I never demanded a stream.
<CCCP> Cypresswolf: oh noes WHAT HAS I DONE! D:
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not going to use all 30 serials myself
<Randomnerd> otakon: Hey how are you?

<LadyCanary> otakon: Alright. Content.
<Derpy_Hooves> cause its so catchy
<MahBoi777> o hey otakon
<Thrackerzod> Yo no hablo ingles
<Wrek> 05elementary: you said "Lawlz> Do I get a kick for being mad that you aren't streaming?" which imlies frustration that there is no stream during unscheduled time. makign you come off as you expect us to stream off the planned schedule. which we only do cause we like to stream you guys stuff. but when people come in and act like "OMG NO STREAMWTF" entitled dickwads.
<Darkts3> So funny thing... my Computer is new and is a extreme gaming computer, but when i get on crysis my game crashes in minutes... =/
<Randomnerd> Chat is awesome! Stream is just gravy!
<junh1024-XD> well, i certainly wouldn't use one of your 'legit' serials for my clients, because i'm making money off dodgy stuff.
<PonySwagg> Maid_Discord: You really should.
<Shizuka> 13wrek is reading my mind
<Wrek> 05the lust to stream unscheduled content greatly diminish
<otakon> Maid_Discord: it's quitting time. TAKE OFF THE UNIFORM.

<drfsupercenter> 03that's commercial piracy
<NightSeas> 02EW pirating for money
<MahBoi777> Thrackerzod: me no habla spreckon con gelos.....ugh I'm no good at spanish...
<Randomnerd> Maid_Discord: Mmm a man in Uniform?
<Darkts3> Gunthler: Wrek is THE BANHAMMER!
<drfsupercenter> 03which is why I refuse to accept money for stuff that I burn
<Wrek> 05i call it calm and contained otakon.
<drfsupercenter> 03but just me giving NightSeas a serial, how is that bad
<otakon> Gunthler: not on me! I don't get pissy when there is no stream, I just lament.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep.
<Aurora> 6it's not lol.
<cachi01> MahBoi777: lol what were u supposed to say?
<PonySwagg> Wrek does not wield the Banhammar.
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not selling them
<Aurora> 6you gave me a full copy of WinXP lol
<PonySwagg> Wrek IS THE BANHAMMAR
<LadyCanary> Oh yes he does.
<drfsupercenter> 03I give Microsoft software out to anyone
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm debating taking Maid Discord a step further, but only for charity.
<TheRainbowDash> PonySwagg: So true.
<drfsupercenter> 03since I can get crap tons of serials
<twilight_sprinkle> Thrackerzod: what racism?
<otakon> Wrek: THAT was calm? .............well I guess the always red text kind of lends to you always seemingly angry. Also, how are you today?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I mean /only/ for charity.
<TheRainbowDash> Nittany_Discord: Wait, what is that step now?
<CupcakeWarrior> Wrek's text is made out of blood
<drfsupercenter> 03technically they're supposed to be "for personal use only" but I'm seriously not going to use all those by mysel.f
<HyperMetalLugia> Do you accept donations?
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!
<LadyCanary> And tears of fear.
<Wrek> 05of blood and the salty tears of haters
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<Randomnerd> CupcakeWarrior: possible.
<drfsupercenter> 03sketchy :P
<Lawlz> Two things, I didn't know there was a time you DON'T stream, and the second thing being that given that there is a freedom of expression, it can only be taken as either irony or sarcasm by anyone who studies U.S. history.
<Dken2021> CupcakeWarrior the blood of his victims?
<Wrek> 05now, does that clear it up Lawlz?
<MahBoi777> cachi01: lol someone was speakin different languages
<Gunthler> otakon: here'sm some Lament for ya :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSLvjfrxynA
<PonySwagg> otakon: LOOT FOR THE LOOT THRONE
<LadyCanary> But sometimes you can taste the wub :3
<otakon> Dken2021: DEFINITELY the blood of his victims
<EpicPwnTime> what do you want to do tonight? remember-I have the chat logs.
<MahBoi777> wub is best invention
<CupcakeWarrior> The banhammer has claimed many victims
<RaveBrony> Hahaha, i saw Wrek make a text wall, so i whiched to another tab in fear :D but then i read it and was informed on a rude pony :|

<Lawlz> Randomnerd, the freedom of expresion is the right to express ourself as seen fit on any form of medium as long as nobody is hurt. And Alister, I'm well aware that most mods will sooner slam the ban button before accepting anything besides themselves as close to correct in the slightest, but Wrex at least didn't kick me immediatly on a miscommunication, which is more than I can say for most admins.
<drfsupercenter> 03but ordinarily not
<cachi01> i finished my first pony IRL photo please let me know what i made wrong so i can improve in the future ^^ http://my-life-with-ponies.deviantart.com/art/Me-and-Pinkie-299377937

<PonySwagg> EpicPwnTime: Next time, we eat Rainbow Dash's mane.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Everyone start demanding ponies so we can see our G3 overlords
<Alister> who the heck pinged me ?
<LadyCanary> ...NO.
<CCCP> Lawlz: TL;DR
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: tell me, if you consider everyone a dick, what do you consider yourself? just curious, for purposes of objectivity you would have to consider yourself a dick as well.
<junh1024-XD> nah
<junh1024-XD> cuz i
<LadyCanary> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Please no ;3;
<drfsupercenter> 03Like I said
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> LadyCanary kay
<Lawlz> I love being objective. ^_^
<junh1024-XD> 'm looking at a pan and phase spectrum
<drfsupercenter> 03I buy the Humble Indie Bundles for a reason
<junh1024-XD> which A4 doesn't have
<TheRainbowDash> CCCP: And ok, then, uncalled for...:D
<icybeauti> Too lazy to demand stuff..Just play some south park or family guy
<drfsupercenter> 03doesn't CS6 have a newer Audition?
<Lawlz> ^demand
<junh1024-XD> yes
<Wrek> 05All in all, anyone that goes "wtf where is my stream" deserves a shoe up the arse. (emphasis on the "my" ) Lawlz you havent done anythign wrong, just keep in mind that, and this goes to everyone. keep in mind that we stream when we can and want. and to start demanding that is simply rude.
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: what?
<MahBoi777> ಠ_ಠ7
<junh1024-XD> prolly doesn't have it
<Videofreak1127> brb
<drfsupercenter> 03is it like A4.5?
<junh1024-XD> but has a pitch display
<TheRainbowDash> Nevermind that...:D
<drfsupercenter> 03pitch display?
<ThreeChris28> Wrek: Good thing many of us never say that.
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: no tell me
<icybeauti> Eeeppp....Screw demanding...
<Lawlz> But, the thing is, I never demanded the stream. -_-
<TheRainbowDash> Bye!:D
<Alister> Lawlz : Objectivity does not exist among humans. It is possible to consider the side of others but true Objectivity is a dream
<junh1024-XD> like for vocals - manual pitch correction?
<cutenesskitteh2> That was weird, it never said that before
<CCCP> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Darkts3> so... Stream?
<cutenesskitteh2> Was I banned?
<MahBoi777> the enemy haz our objective
<FaithHeart> usually I ask what happened with the stream, but I don't demand it
*Alister huds TheRainbowDash bye
<ThreeChris28> -UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
<twilight_sprinkle> Alister: so? that doesnt mean we shouldnt try to be objectiv
<ponies47> demands are bad Mmmk
<Lawlz> I'm objective on almost every subject I encounter.
<drfsupercenter> 03but can it detect what note is being played at a given point in a song?
<Gunthler> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKZ4Lv0kujQ&feature=plcp Have some awesome music :)
<Digitalis> I never demand, its just disrespectful. My mom taught me better than that
<icybeauti> Still not as bad as when stream goes out b4 an episode,,,
<Alister> hugs*
<SaxyPretender> 0,14doesn't seem like it, cutenesskitteh2
<pony_22> Awesome Gunthler! Thanks!
<junh1024-XD> possibly, if it's isolated vocals
<ThreeChris28> That does suck.
<cutenesskitteh2> SaxyPretender: I hope not...
<PonySwagg> Next time, we eat Celestia. And Luna. And Cadence.
<MahBoi777> demanding only brings horror, oh teh horror
<Lawlz> I think I should be an admin because power abuse is fun.
<Alister> twilight_sprinkle : I was saying that because SOMEONE tought he was being objective
<drfsupercenter> 03what about an instrumental?>
<junh1024-XD> izotope, autotune, and melodyne have done that for ages
<cutenesskitteh2> Did I miss the you-know-what?
<junh1024-XD> what about an instrumental?> < what about it?
<CupcakeWarrior> dat kick
<icybeauti> PonySwagg: And east some Time Lord
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Woooo No school tomorrow.... the sad moment when i realize i don't have anything better to do than school right now
<Digitalis> HA
<otakon> WOW that was nuts
<Lawlz> Admin abuse.
<drfsupercenter> 03can it find the pitch of an instrumental
<ThreeChris28> The you-know-what?
<Alister> who got kicked ?
<otakon> firefox crashed on me
<pony_22> CCCP: Why must you rage and question TheRainbowDash? That silly filly is just her..:P
<icybeauti> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Lucky!
<twilight_sprinkle> Alister: I was the one who started about objectivity. i said that Wrek shoul consider himself a dick as well if he considers everyone to be a dick, for purposes of objectivity.
<junh1024-XD> how many instruments are in the instrumental?
<MahBoi777> a kick in tha head?
<Dken2021> power abuse is always fun
<Videofreak1127> Just finished the fifth book in Harry Potter
<PonySwagg> Hmm...
<PonySwagg> HEY GAIZ
<drfsupercenter> 03no idea.

<icybeauti> Most people I know hate me except my squad and my group of friends. Other than that....:P

<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> You know how you can download desktop images from Deviant art?
<Xanbreon> And abandon the version number
<drfsupercenter> 03why not just make a revision?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01ValtheJean: Congrats on getting a job.
<otakon> ValtheJean: a'www, well hopefully you won't miss the friday movies eh?
<Alister> Lawlz : the having an opinion rule
<drfsupercenter> 034, 5, 6, 7, 8 were basically the exact same thing
<drfsupercenter> 03then 9 added added crap
<LadyCanary> :3 thats great Val!!!
<icybeauti> Dken2021: I squees loudly, but flutter wins
<PonySwagg> Wrek: Secret weapon, much?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> gratz ValtheJean
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> I download them but all they give me is a firefox RAR file
<NotBigSurprise> Can anyone tell me what is going on?
<otakon> ValtheJean: also, congrats man and good luck.
<drfsupercenter> 0310 was the same as 9
<FlareChaser> Wrek: Can I do a yo dawg meme please?
<Xanbreon> Not really
<drfsupercenter> 03and then 11 and 12 are the same?
<drfsupercenter> 03AFAIK
<MahBoi777> Videofreak1127: AAAAAAAAAAH
<xcanox> I think Wrek has the right idea.
<Randomnerd> ValtheJean: You found work? Gratz
<PonySwagg> On that note. I like this PMV.
<Xanbreon> Nope
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Otakon: eh...actually, I will most likely miss a majority of friday streams
<RaveBrony> I cant be a douchebag sadly.... Its just not in my nature :\
<drfsupercenter> 03my point being
<Randomnerd> Nuuuuuuuuuuuu
<drfsupercenter> 03remember the 2.0s?
<PonySwagg> This is like
<PonySwagg> What this show is about.
<CupcakeWarrior> We'll miss you Val
<drfsupercenter> 03it was 2.0.0.16, 2.0.0.18, 2.0.0.20 etc
<DairyCannon> ValtheJean grats
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and it isn't really *found* work, as I've worked here every summer for like...5 years
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Val working The Man, I see
<Xanbreon> Do you want me to go find the src control system checkin log
<drfsupercenter> 03none of this jumping whole numbers crap
<icybeauti> RaveBrony: Same. I suck at being mean.
<FlareChaser> I can't be a douchebag, I never was.
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> ......
<xcanox> It's my experience that "He's a douchebag." is a safer assumption than "He's a respectable guy."
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*working for
<Xanbreon> Do i need to quote myself?
*Randomnerd is a doormat :(
<xcanox> Props to Wrek for brains.
<kenne> RaveBrony: you say that likes its a bad thing...
<otakon> ValtheJean: oh
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Sigh...so much for any help
<PonySwagg> Who did this?
<Digitalis> awww Randomnerd
<Randomnerd> ...that carries a different set of problems.
<Lawlz> Punsihing me for having an opinion is a violation of basic human rights. And if you're religious, is defying your god/gods/goddess/goddesses
<MahBoi777> I'm not mean to anyone unless they give me a reason to:P
*Digitalis hugs Randomnerd
<RaveBrony> Someone insults me? I just shrug my shoulders and keep wwalkin :D
<Digitalis> its ok, have a hug
*Randomnerd hugs back
*LadyCanary sighs.
<Wrek> 05also lawlz for the last time you havent broken any rule.
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: you said most of the time. being a douchebag most of the time isnt correct behavior. i dislike people in general too maybe, but i avoid contact, i certainly never pull the trigger first
<FlareChaser> RaveBrony: same here, I can't be a douchebag.... proud of it.
<NightSeas> 02I do have to agree with drf
<PonySwagg> Seriously, who did this.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 bronystate does not recognize human rights
*Dken2021 hugs Randomnerd
<LadyCanary> :3 It's true. No one is meant to be alone. <3
<kenne> RaveBrony: lol, haters gunna hate
<CCCP> i need to stop being sad
<Lawlz> Then why did I get a #1?
<NightSeas> 02FF went insane for a little bit
<icybeauti> I just can't do it. I usually end up crying if someone says somethign bad to me...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14We recognize pony rights
<RaveBrony> kenne: Indeed
<PonySwagg> That was much win.
*Randomnerd hugs Dken2021
<Alister> @ValtheJean I can testify that !
*CCCP tries to smile
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> How many times do I have to ask a question before people actually respond?
<NullRadix> Does bronystate have a flag yet?
*LadyCanary squees HAPPILY.
<Randomnerd> I cannot answer it, Meta-Arceus-Ridley
<CCCP> Meta-Arceus-Ridley: many
<Litwick> fffffffFF YES
<NotBigSurprise> Hm.
<LadyCanary> OH MY GOSH. MY FAVORITE SONG IN THIS EPISODE.
<Digitalis> Squeeeeeeee!!!!
<miner_oo> YESS DETHKLOK!!!
<Videofreak1127> @ValtheJean: Then do they recognize pony rights?
<xcanox> icybeauti: I wouldn't admit that in public. You're likely to get trolled.
<Xanbreon> Who cares, its a version number
<FaithHeart> http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/119/1/7/commission_for_raidan4649_by_krowzivitch-d4y0y3t.jpg

<icybeauti> DETHTOK!!!WOOOO
<Wrek> 05dayum chat is rolling tonight
<Randomnerd> Oooh! Squirrel
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: you kicked him, even though he didnt break rules. technically thats power abuse. you couldve asked him nicely
<Derpy_Hooves> THAT MOMENT WHEN you were typing up a letter to a univwersity for registration and your fucking laptop crashes D:<
<CupcakeWarrior> BOOBS

<Randomnerd> Derpy_Hooves: damn.
<drfsupercenter> 03I just call it version whoring
<drfsupercenter> 03it annoys me
<LadyCanary> I liek Metalocalypse <3 <3
<Xanbreon> Why do you care?
<Darkts3> oh god Metalocalypse
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes it's being anal over something small
<drfsupercenter> 03but still
<kenne> that feel when you have hard candy stuck to your teeth and when you try and get it off it feels like your gunna yank your tooth out
<drfsupercenter> 03I prever revision numbers to just jumping the gun
<Videofreak1127> ???
<Xanbreon> As i said, trying to depreciate the version number
<Lawlz> Well, seeing as I apparently broke no rule, I reserve the right to be really fucking confused when people give me numbers.
<drfsupercenter> 03or even things like Linuxes do, where you name it after the year
<Wrek> 05hm?
<cutenesskitteh2> My stream is acting up -_-
<drfsupercenter> 03year/date
<Dken2021> ah, the wonders of anthropology, I liked that class
<Xanbreon> As the web is just moving to quickly
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: an example of your mindset leading to a premature assumption and kick, overriding your supposed mutual respect
<Biglaw> :D
*CupcakeWarrior headbangs
<LadyCanary> Toki Wartooth is my baby. Candy. Tastes like chicken if chicken were a candy.
<CCCP> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03it was back in Firefox 2 and 3 too
<drfsupercenter> 03didn't stop them
<NotBigSurprise> I actually removed a tooth by biting on a Tootsie Roll. It pulled my tooth out.
<MahBoi777> kenne: I hate that feeling, stupid jolly ranchers
<Alister> DO YOU FOLKS LIKE COFFEE ?
<Xanbreon> gogo gadget build date as version number :P
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> So how many peopl here use the desktops that are from EQD?
<drfsupercenter> 03until Chrome started version whoring and FF jumped on the bandwagon

<drfsupercenter> 03Chrome isn't even that great :P
<NightSeas> 02^
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: well ill admit its good you at least didnt kick him. still, you seem to like calling people dicks, which isnt nice either.
<FlareChaser> Why is the chat going crazy today, I can barely talk.

<Alister> FlareChaser : do you have new pictures on your deviant ?

<Bobeh> Hi everypony.
<Xanbreon> Every month and a bit, the version number goes up
<Randomnerd> otakon: Meta cannot download destop ponies
*cutenesskitteh2 goes up into tower with horn, eyes peeled for outbreak
<Digitalis> See i told you!
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> otakon: I went to download a desktop background from DA when I found it on EQD and all it gave me was a firefox RAR file
<Xera> This chat always looked like this to me.
<MahBoi777> FlareChaser: no idea, just tryin to keep up, lol
<Digitalis> I told you!
<Randomnerd> Hi, Bobeh
<miner_oo> i gotta try this yopo!!
<Xanbreon> Mostly as a ref point for bug reports
<FlareChaser> CCCP: Because what is?
<twilight_sprinkle> Lawlz: sorry, my time machine broke
<HeroBrine_theBrone> That looks like the dude off of bevis and butthead
<Calcos323> Hey, I left for a while. Whose streaming?
<MahBoi777> hey Bobeh
<Lawlz> I have a spare Tardis.
<icybeauti> Dang, I have 30!3 stuck in my head now...shush girl, shut your lips, do the helen keller and talk with your hips...:(
<Lawlz> Anyone want one?
<pikorar> Gasp! Metalocalypse!? Yes!
<LadyCanary> Lawlz: Just tellin ya: when people complain that there arent ponies on stream, Val will play G3 ponies. Be careful.
<CCCP> FlareChaser: idk its just one of thouse days
<Lawlz> Hmmm.
<LadyCanary> Stops copies me.
<Xanbreon> Chrome has given the web browser market a shake up
<Calcos323> Oh, Val's streaming
<drfsupercenter> 03still, browser wars are stupid
<Lawlz> *looks innocent* there aren't enough ponies here.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 LadyCanary: or other various troll methods :P
<drfsupercenter> 03I like Firefox because it works
<NightSeas> 02also I tried Chrome once and it wasn't any faster. So I don't know why so many people are going "Chrome is faster FTW"
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Darkts3> when something violent and weird shows.. its Val xD
<CupcakeWarrior> Everypony start complaining!
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Stupid desktop backgrounds....
<LadyCanary> Charles Foster Offsden is best manager <3 <3
<Randomnerd> LadyCanary: Just put them on ignore, I've put a few people on ignore for a day or two just to keep sane.
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't like the way it looks
<pony_35> If you complain and he shows G3, I'll BREAK YOU!! >.<
<miner_oo> STOPS COPIES ME!!
<MahBoi777> trololololol
<drfsupercenter> 03isn't that a valid complaint?
<Alister> The playing G3 ponies thing is SO old !
<Xanbreon> Its no longer expected to have to wait 6months for new webtech to hit the stable branch
<drfsupercenter> 03since they basically all dot he same thing
<Calcos323> STOPS COPIES ME
<drfsupercenter> 03even IE works fine if you just surf the web
<LadyCanary> ....Guys, come on. Im not in the mood for this crap.
<Digitalis> lmao! god i love this episode! xD
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not one of those unjustified-bias people
<MahBoi777> LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03after IE added tabs, no reason not to use it
<Xanbreon> Without the browser "wars" we would still be using IE6
<pikorar> I copies you whens I wants!
<Wrek> 05but then again, usign demeaning terms against someone without a cause seem redundant to me. in the sentence of direct accusation and not generalization.
<icybeauti> My little copies: STOPS COPIES ME!
<drfsupercenter> 03not really
<Xanbreon> <drfsupercenter> I'm not one of those unjustified-bias people < LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
<Lawlz> Or, or, you could just leave it on some random person watching youtube videos. That might work.
<Xera> What's the problem, LadyCanary?
<Xanbreon> Im adding that to my funny quote pile
<drfsupercenter> 03Microsoft updates their browsers just like anybody else
<Wrek> 05but the nagain for all i know im a large hypocrite aswell.
<CupcakeWarrior> ewww
<drfsupercenter> 03>IE10 in Windows 8 beta
<pikorar> That's why you pee in a bucket first.

<Litwick> I think he's talking about the Candairu fish.
<Lawlz> If they can say this on the stream, I'mma start talking about mayflies.
<icybeauti> lyra iz a sea pony!
<Randomnerd> (It's how I haven't exploded at a certain Mustachioed brony, yet :P)
<drfsupercenter> 03how is my bias unjustified? I give legitimate reasons for not liking the stuff I don't like
<MahBoi777> gotta go faster
<drfsupercenter> 03o_O
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Why the hell do I need to pay to use RAR

<Alister> @Wrek Lawlz : I'm Alister. I may have no authority here but might I ask you both to just apologize to each other and let everyone a chance to chat ?
<FlareChaser> Randomnerd: No no, tell me.
<drfsupercenter> 03lots of programs used to suck
<NightSeas> 02[20:33] <HyperMetalLugia> INB4 Chrome is too ugly <-- to me yeah

<drfsupercenter> 03how exactly do they go about doing that
*CupcakeWarrior noms twilight_sprinkle
<FlareChaser> Oh, okay.
*Lawlz gets hit several feet forward by the door.

<Yahooz> Lola is deathklok on the stream?
<otakon> wow
<otakon> LadyKlok: who?
<Monfang> Going to drop something random, but I honestly hope that if they do go into it, that Scootaloo doesn't find her talent in things like Rainbow Dash.
<scottalo> im the forever alone pony in mlp :'(
<LadyKlok> Marty Friedman of Megadeth!!!!!!!!!!!!
*LadyKlok squeals

<LadyKlok> Just pointing out a metal guitarist who was in that episode.

*SaxyPretender headbangs
<Gunthler|Zzz> I want Fluttershy to lullaby me to sleep :(
<drfsupercenter> 03so my parents just randomly went out and bought a minivan the other day.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14My Little Dethklok: Friendship is Brutal
*TheHoodyNinja gives Gunthler|Zzz one of his Fluttershys
<Monfang> Exactly, Raondomnerd. So Scootaloo, who we already know is a poor flyer, should find a talent of her own instead of following behind Rainbow Dash.
<Gunthler|Zzz> Wrek: I'm sure it would :3
<drfsupercenter> 03because I have the SUV up here at college with me, and my sister's home from her college for the summer and trying to get a job
<drfsupercenter> 03so my parents are like

<Yahooz> FYAC!
<Kandarihu> I kind of understood Nathan Explosion's reasons for deleting this song, but not it's honestly growing on me.

<drfsupercenter> 03so I guess they can share the van
<drfsupercenter> 03w/e
<SparkleButt> It was probably meant as a brony nod, though
<LadyKlok> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03they gave me the choice
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm installing Facade right now
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol

<Kyu> 07technically 4 cars, 2 drivers if my dad's gf doesn't count |D

<Biglaw> Dethbuck

<Monfang> LIke they get a name close to their family, but then they add on one from their talents.
<scottalo> i should get mine littel pony
<drfsupercenter> 03I learned how to drive in that
<Randomnerd> Some cultures have kids change their names.

<drfsupercenter> 03*to
<Monfang> LIke Asura from Guild Wars 2

<HyperMetalLugia> You can only own 1 car per house here, unless you can use the apartment loopholes

<FlareChaser> Screw it I cant draw :(
<otakon> PANDERING!
<Kyu> 07also she lives in SF, so ends up being really rusty every year
<otakon> FlareChaser: practice dammit
*Monfang goes off to write more.
<FlareChaser> otakon: ugh...fine.
<Aurora> 6oh
<Aurora> 6that
<otakon> FlareChaser: just keep practicing!
<Aurora> 6would do it
<Kandarihu> He's the glue that holds the band together. And with them, the world.
<Biglaw> FlareChaser drawing daily is a good way to practice :D
<Darkts3> =/

<otakon> LadyKlok: you want it don't you?
<Wrek> 05so fet practicing your art skill
<scottalo> afuklc
<Kandarihu> So by that logic, Charles Foster Ofdenson is keeping the world off the brink of chaos.
<Wrek> 05at 70 you get the pony perk
<drfsupercenter> 03wait what
<FlareChaser> Wrek: what...
<drfsupercenter> 033 permits?
<FlareChaser> D:
<drfsupercenter> 03in CA it's one per year?
<LadyKlok> .....No. YOU WILL NOT KILL CHARLES ;3;
<Randomnerd> Monfang: Twilight Sparkle and Shining Armor have similar names, perhaps their family is something related to something reflective or radiant.
<Wrek> 05im makign a fallout reference
<drfsupercenter> 03here you can just keep yours until you take the test o.o
<sub06905> pony perk?
<Darkts3> FlareChaser: Just google Instructions
<drfsupercenter> 03unless you turn 18 before that, I think
<Aurora> 6permits expire
<FlareChaser> oh, lol now I get it! :D
<drfsupercenter> 03ours didn't
<Aurora> 6here
<otakon> Wrek: we know

<Sylandest> Ryanier128: when i first watched it, i had the same reaction. but it will all make sense in time
*Ryanier128 tunes back into the local Brony radio station
<otakon> Adroc Thruston saved the world from the "Summer of Love"?
<twilight_sprinkle> yay, school's out!
<MyBodyIsReady> LOL
<otakon> do they explain WHAT the Summer of Love was?
<Sylandest> lol @ twilight_sprinkle
<ValtheJean> 2,14 later -_-
<Shizuka> 13wasn't it 1969
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: my thought later
<Sylandest> falcon punch
<otakon> ValtheJean: okay sorry I'll stop saying how confused I am
<ValtheJean> 2,14 jesus christ...just because they don't tell you everything in the first 5 seconds doesn't mean you can't just enjoy the damn show
<Cobellanez> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> i enjoy complicated plots, too bad im too busy to watch the show properly :(
<BlushingCanary> Preach it Val.
<Ryanier128> otakon you remind me of my Brony Initiation days. They were the best of times, and . . . aww, buck it, it wasn't pretty
<Monfang|lazy> Consperisy theory time! http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-nasa-is-just-a-cover.jpg
<otakon> ValtheJean: it's just they don't even explain the stuff the KIDS in the universe know already. They throw terms and jargon at us immediately with no explanation on their significance. That's all I'll say about it and I'm trying to enjoy the show.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no see, the kids DON'T know it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's the point
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he's a kid
<otakon> ValtheJean: the kids know what a LFO is
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he finds out a lot about this stuff as you do
<otakon> yeah I see that
<Monfang|lazy> Trixie's real talent: http://img.ponibooru.org/images/af/af2a6e97c3653dc6fbe374da115805d8
<ValtheJean> 2,14 what, you can't just realize that when they say "LFO" when talking about big giant robots, that's what they're refering to?
<scootminer> troll military
<Monfang|lazy> A question I've been wondering but never had the time to ask: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-marescotch.jpg
<Monfang|lazy> How does that work?
<twilight_sprinkle> thas MY base! get off mah property, SOLDIER FAGS
<Ryanier128> I know how he feels
<otakon> ValtheJean: yeah but I'd like to know what LFO actually means since it's clearly an acronym.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Light Flying Object -_-
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's a military term
<Ryanier128> it's an object that's light and flies, duh!

<CupcakeWarrior> Sometimes I feel like Im the only one who prefers dubs
<otakon> they couldn't have just said that once? when do they actually call a LFO by it's actual name in the show? Please tell me :)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes
<Ryanier128> seems legit
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and even if they didn't, that's a terribly lame excuse to dislike the show
<twilight_sprinkle> oh otakon...
<Ryanier128> how does one become a hero after he dies?
<otakon> ValtheJean: oh no, I never said I dislike the show. It's just I had trouble keeping up with the myriad of names.
<otakon> Ryanier128: posthumousrly
<MyBodyIsReady> dat snort
<TwiilightSparkle> snort
<TwiilightSparkle> lfo
<otakon> and there goes your house
<TwiilightSparkle> lol
<Ryanier128> well, there you go. An LFO is a skateboard that lets you surf air.
<Ryanier128> seems legit
<Sylandest> Ryanier128: thats...kinda it. but not quite, lol
<twilight_sprinkle> they were told to get insurance against gian robots, but noooooo
<BlushingCanary> For a second I thought he said elephant
<otakon> yeah, no one EVER expects a giant robot to crash on their house
<Kandarihu> Oh. I thought the LFO is the robot that rides the surf-board.
<otakon> Also, our love intersest everyone
<Ryanier128> "her"?
<TwiilightSparkle> Forget Logic Twilight... Forget. Logi- The reason why that crashes was maybe it got out of control or it was an accident.
<otakon> Ryanier128: same deal with referring to ships as "she" probably
<Sylandest> otakon: beat me to it, lol
<otakon> lol
<Ryanier128> I see otakon . . .
<TwiilightSparkle> Hey Sylandest, Today's my birthday *squee*

<Sylandest> TwiilightSparkle: Happy Birthday! *gives hug and swings you about*
<Ryanier128> wait, the robot is the LFO now?!?
<TwiilightSparkle> Thank you ^^
<Sylandest> TwiilightSparkle: What do you plan to do?
<otakon> Ryanier128: it can transform
<TwiilightSparkle> Sylandest: I dont know actually My friends said it's a surprise or something.

<Sylandest> TwiilightSparkle: A surprise is always fun! I'm glad your friends are willing to put such effort for you!
<otakon> Ryanier128: just wait it gets more befuddling
<TwiilightSparkle> Sylandest: :$
<TwiilightSparkle> I wish they had a squee emote for each pony.
<otakon> Okay so humans can't control a LFO without a Compac Drive
<twilight_sprinkle> will it all right
<Stardust_Phoenix> first episode?

<Sylandest> *first
<otakon> ValtheJean: I could of figured
<TwiilightSparkle> You know whats weird? I still remember a phone number I saw on someone's truck for like 5 seconds xD
<CupcakeWarrior> I love how in subs you cant see the action because you have to read the screen
<scootminer> yawn
<otakon> ValtheJean: it's a anime OVA based kind of like off of the old 50's flying saucer movies. It's pretty good
<CrimsonPhoenix> That chrono trigger
<CrimsonPhoenix> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW

<Kandarihu> I wish you wouldn't stop the ED songs
<Sylandest> TwiilightSparkle: was it a big number? lol

<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's a shame they don't have all the anime I'd like to watch
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: anyplace i can catch the first few eps?
<Ryanier128> If it WAS Bronies then Derpy would be hidden somewhere in every episode
<otakon> ValtheJean: have you tried Crackle? It's got a couple on it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no I haven't
<otakon> ValtheJean: it's free too, plus it has movies
<TwiilightSparkle> I keep hearing and seeing things that sound like brony stuff
<TwiilightSparkle> For example I thought I just heard the theme say brohoof xD
<Sylandest> TwiilightSparkle: hehehe, who knows? subliminal messaging and all that
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat ValtheJean

<Cetan> >There are no Twin Towers in Deus Ex, a game released in the year 2000. Because of memory limitations, the developers took the non-Twin Towers dominated part of Manhattans landscape and mirrored it; as the first few levels explained that the Statue of Liberty had been destroyed by a terrorist group, the developers threw up their hands and declared that so had the Twin Towers.

<TheRandomkid321> SO MUCH FOR STEALTH!
<CrazyCherry> Dat sniping action
<TheRandomkid321> SPoiler alert. That ashley chick dies @ the end of the mission.
<Mutterguy> yeah I think earth's is 100 times thicker...
<Kammerjunk|School> poni should poni poni
<TheRandomkid321> Dat spoiler was a lie
<Kammerjunk> I'm guessing Sumica's playing?
<Scarlet> My game has Kaiden.
<Kandarihu> Eeyup
<pyrocatboy> yay
<Kammerjunk> Right-o.
<Kammerjunk> Windows are for the weak, anyway.
<JRP2234|webchat> sumica seems legit
<TheRandomkid321> SHOOT HER
<TheRandomkid321> THAT FEMALE IS A SPY!!! GET BACK TO LE KITCHEN
<Princess_Cadence> bored think gonna leave
<TheRandomkid321> None of ghose choices where very dicklike
<Kammerjunk> Guess the fact that an unstoppable race makes people co-operate.
<Kammerjunk> that an unstoppable race is invading*
<Princess_Cadence> cya!
<Kammerjunk> Valedico, Princess_Cadence!
<CrazyCherry> CYA!!
<TheRandomkid321> BOOM HEDSAHWT!
<CrazyCherry> Lol
<TheRandomkid321> Om im gonna stop using caps from now on.
<Kammerjunk> Actually, research is being done on making transparent cover.
<Kammerjunk> I think it's either Japan or DARPA. Not really sure.
<pyrocatboy> ded
<TheRandomkid321> dead
<Mutterguy> smart
<CrazyCherry> Dat language
<Mutterguy> Go for the optics!
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, biotics are the win.
<Mutterguy> yet?
<Kandarihu> You know what? If there were a substance that's reliably bulletproof and clearly transparent, it would be worth just building full body armor out of such stuff, and everyone would see the guy's uniform underneath or whatever.
<JRP2234[iPhone]> Sumica what is ur bitrate ?
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: Give it 10 years at max.
<pyrocatboy> Kandarihu: Or nothing at all.
<Kammerjunk> >Feels like I'm wearing nothing at all
<Mutterguy> damn sexy flanders ><
<JRP2234[iPhone]> Sumica go the blues!!!
<Kammerjunk> But no, they're not working on anything as simple as transparency. They've working on bending light.
*CrazyCherry still misses GilDash
<pyrocatboy> Stuipid sexy Kammerjunk
<Kandarihu> Well, I doubt that such an armor would work against lasers though. It guards against bullets but light passes through.
<Kammerjunk> wat
<CrazyCherry> Dat yay
<Mutterguy> Kammerjunk: homer's response
<CrazyCherry> Dat force push
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: Well, it's your lucky day then, because that's exactly what they're working on preventing.
<JRP2234[iPhone]> I nos like American football. AFL ftw
<Mutterguy> yeah if it bends light...
<Simon2> hi Phase4

<Saturn> 8,1finally!
<ofna01> Resaluta,Kammer!
<Kandarihu> Well, I suppose that would make it more sensible to just make a mostly opaque shield with a transparent armor.
<Kammerjunk> I don't even know what Beltane is. I have exams from tomorrow on, nothing happy about it.
<Mutterguy> invisible bicycle! >^.^<!
<CrazyCherry> SUMMER YAY!!!!!

*Kammerjunk hugs Saturn back.

<JRP2234[iPhone]> Sumica Healthyuncle and Mux are god

<Kammerjunk> "Beltane or Beltaine is the anglicised spelling of Old Irish Bel(l)taine or Beltine (modern Irish Bealtaine, Scottish Gaelic Bealltainn, the Gaelic name for either the month of May or the festival that takes place on the first day of May."
*Mutterguy was just punning
*CrazyCherry starts to nom on Sumica's mane
<Phase4> ohai Simon2 and Mutterguy
<Simon2> Phase4: dat late reply

<Phase4> seems legit
<Kammerjunk> ...Along with Legion.
<Kammerjunk> LC = Lieutenant Commander

<Gunthler|School> Ohai, Mornin' guys
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Because you killed him
<Gunthler|School> I'm tired ZzZ
<Kammerjunk> thegt90: Only the ending is that bad, really. I mean, the gameplay itself certainly brought some good additions (But then again, it also took away being able to sheath my bloody weapon).
<thegt90> i know ive played it on ps3
<Twi_Fi> Will I get arrested for this?
<ofna01> MUCH better!
<CrazyCherry> ASDF-movie
<Kammerjunk> Well, they claim it's because consoles didn't have enough memory, which just sounds silly to me.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> No, you just have to live with the guilt that you contributed to the death of steven_magnet
<Twi_Fi> Hello Gunthler|School.
<Kammerjunk> Salve, Gunthler|School.

*Twi_Fi drowns guilt in alcohol.
<ofna01> do ho ho,that slaps me on ze knee!
<Shane377> again
<CrazyCherry> DED
<Kammerjunk> Gunthler|School: Well, Latin, but yeah.
<Twi_Fi> Death was so nice that he died twice.
<Kammerjunk> Can you do that? Can you die twice?
<CrazyCherry> Sumica: Y U SO DED?
<Gunthler|School> Kammerjunk: The Romans spoke Latin.
<Kammerjunk> Exactly.
<CrazyCherry> Idiot Liara
<ofna01> Si lontana,da scienza,cara,cara mia bambina,a mia bell,a mia cara,a mia cara,mia bambina,oh cara,cara mi
<CrazyCherry> Da Fudge Liara
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, and since I'm no longer on the subject of what you can't do in ME3, I wish I was still able to move corpses.
<ofna01> thats all latin
<Mutterguy> Cerebus has a lot of troops
<CrazyCherry> Allonsy!
<ofna01> Cerebus?
<ofna01> a bus?
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: If you're thinking of the Portal 2 song, it was in Italian.
<ofna01> eeyup
<pyrocatboy> ues

<Frank> I almost facepalmed myself
<CrazyCherry> DED

<Twi_Fi> Who is Chuck Norris?
*ofna01 FALCON PAUNCH's KAmmer
<ofna01> falco
<Kammerjunk> And I don't like him. Mostly because I've experienced Barrens Chat as well as the LFG channel when it was server-wide.
<ofna01> ,PAWWWNCH
<Kammerjunk> Falcon Punch doesn't stand anything against the Barrens Chat.
<CrazyCherry> Sumica: You have a Banana phone?

<Sumica> 00,10I like this bad guy
<twilight_sprinkle> Twi_Fi: ill eat your brain then
<Twi_Fi> 4chan!
*Twi_Fi runs
<YamaTHou> oh shit buffer
<Jim> so you like mmmbananas?
<Sumica> 00,10this guy is such a dick
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I wouldnt post unsafe things from 4chan
<cachi01> where can i see if a movie is A or B
<Dark_Horst> mega-dick
<cachi01> imdb?
<Very_Silly_Filly> The shit is bananas. B-a-n-ana-a-s
<Sumica> 00,10check imdb and roten tomatoes
<cachi01> thx
<RX-78-SweetieBot> although I usually derpy.me them so people dont avoid them like scared little children
<twilight_sprinkle> rotten tomatoes sucks
<Twi_Fi> I cannot permit anyone to eat my brain.
<pablez94> Very_Silly_Filly: bananaas?
<twilight_sprinkle> they gave biebers movie a higher score than one of the Star Wars
<Twi_Fi> I am sorry.
<Sumica> 00,10high budget and or high rateings is an A
<Very_Silly_Filly> NO, BANANAS....bananas.....bananas....my bananas though, my bananas fell in the fat
<Twi_Fi> I am not a scared little child!
*Twi_Fi runs away.
<Very_Silly_Filly> If anyone can name what I robbed that from, you are consisdered awesome.
<Sumica> 00,10Roten tomatoes has two scores for movies which did you check twilight_sprinkle
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: i dont remember, but probably the critic score
*Twi_Fi continues running far far away.
<twilight_sprinkle> since i know the general audienc ewould hate it
<pablez94> Very_Silly_Filly: oh! so u are talknig about tomatoes! u could say it before!
<twilight_sprinkle> on imdb it got like a 2
<Sumica> 00,10Yeah the people paied to give oppinions dont sit well
<twilight_sprinkle> i think rottentomatoes critics either got paid to do it, or they did it to show how "objective" they are
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://derpy.me/oXM99
<cachi01> lol idk if in B movie i should do Killer Clowns from outer space
<cachi01> xd
<thegt90> hey where do u guys go to check movie ratings
<cachi01> it so bad
<twilight_sprinkle> thegt90: imdb or rottentomatoes
<Digitalis> Remember B movies =/= bad, but its fun to make fun of horrible movies xD
<cachi01> xd
<pablez94> CrazyCherry: hey i don't hear u since a while what happened?
<Twi_Fi> That's a blow to the heart.
<CrazyCherry> pablez94: I'm just reading some comics
<GLaDOS> Are all the episodes of Burn Notice on YouTube?
<Sumica> 00,10not sure
<pablez94> oh ok,then. fisical one or r u reading them on da net CrazyCherry ?
<Sumica> 00,10never needed to look
<thegt90> the movie i picked was a 7.4 rating and had a 5.5 million budget
<CrazyCherry> pablez94: internets
<pablez94> CrazyCherry: may u give me da link i'm boring...
<twilight_sprinkle> Star Wars 1: 57-62 ratings; fagboy the movie: 64-65 ratings. BULL-SHIT
<CrazyCherry> pablez94: you probably mean bored
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://derpy.me/KOd-a
<RX-78-SweetieBot> heres somethign happier
<pablez94> CrazyCherry: GRAMMAR FAIL
<RX-78-SweetieBot> although after that the Luna thread I was browsing goes into nsfw territory
<CrazyCherry> http://shwiggityshwah.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4e0th5
<twilight_sprinkle> top critics gave SW 38- fagboy the movie got 58
<pablez94> CrazyCherry: thanks a lot
<Twi_Fi> 4chan.org is happier?
<CrazyCherry> pablez94: You're welcome!
<twilight_sprinkle> no matter how relatively bad SW 1 was compared to other parts, its never worse than a movie about fagboy
<RX-78-SweetieBot> both images were from 4chan
<twilight_sprinkle> which is why rottentomatoes suck
*CrazyCherry misses GilDash
<Twi_Fi> But the link just shows the test "4chan.org"
<Twi_Fi> *text
<RX-78-SweetieBot> huh
<RX-78-SweetieBot> but the first one didnt... thats weird
<Hazard> WAZZAAAAAAAAAAP
<Shizuka> 13thing is, rotten tomatoes uses actual critics to score the movies
<cachi01> uhmm i voted for b movie a movie thats only in german and spanish is that k??? u would need to watch it with english subtitles
<cachi01> Hazard: WAAAAAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Twi_Fi> Yeah, I could see the first one.
<YamaTHou> hi Hazard
<Shizuka> 13which makes them more reliable than IMDB's user-only ratings
<Hazard> cachi01: WHAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<cachi01> YO GUYS PICK UP THE PHONE
<Twi_Fi> But the last one, I can't.
<YamaTHou> ohai Shizuka
<GLaDOS> pistols at long range: not very effective
*CrazyCherry hugs cachi01
<RainbowAsh> What just happened?
<Hazard> alright brb
<Twi_Fi> I have no answers.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> me either
<twilight_sprinkle> SW1 cant be that much worse than fagboy movie
<Sumica> 00,10would not be the first subed movie we have done
*cachi01 hugs CrazyCherry back
<cachi01> cool
<twilight_sprinkle> real critics are jsut as biased as ordinary viewers
*CrazyCherry hugs Sumica
<twilight_sprinkle> i bet they either got payed, or they did it to look "objective"
<Dark_Horst> indeed, i noticed that the 8.1 rating and the reviews there about aguirre were made up crap
<Twi_Fi> Hi Hazard.
<Hazard> :)
<cachi01> its called lissi und der wilde kaiser
<cachi01> or el reino de los chiflados
<Twi_Fi> Hi Shizuka.

<cachi01> hi shizu!
*Sumica tackle glomps Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13oof
<twilight_sprinkle> and how in hell is the audience reaction 64% on rottentomatoes, and yet on imdb like 20%?i call bullshit
*CrazyCherry hugs twilight _sprinkle
*twilight_sprinkle eats CrazyCherry
<CrazyCherry> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Digitalis> Jeez calm down...
<Shizuka> 13that's why i don't use user ratings in the backlog when i can avoid it
<twilight_sprinkle> *spits out CrazyCherry * OMFG IT TALKS
<twilight_sprinkle> i think rottentomatoes just got paid, the audience ratings cant be that different whhen we're talking about bieber
*CrazyCherry hugs GLaDOS

<CrazyCherry> Princess_Cadence: Cadence!!!!
<Sundaysmile> timer*
<Litwick> You will NOT censor Derpy also.
<Princess_Cadence> CrazyCherry!! :)
<Sundaysmile> you might need more time depending on the situ
<RankWinner> You could just change the time at the bottom Sumica, shouldn't be too hard
<alexxm> good RainbowAsh how about you
