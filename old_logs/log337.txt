<Saturn> 8,1but frak it, i have 8 gigs installed
<unfoundbug> what settings on BF3
<Wrek> 05when not streaming
<Nick> Highest if I'm sniping, medium if I'm running around like a moron.
<unfoundbug> i only tend to play with everything either maxed, or overriden to be higher
<Wrek> 05recource consukmption isnt ap roblem for me, so im ok with firefox in that regard
<Nick> Chrome i think uses up more memory, but i think thats worth the speed.
<Nick> Usually i have 3 programs open, fraps, skype, and chrome
<unfoundbug> heh, you wouldnt want to see my taskbar then if thats all you run :P
<prince-dari> I always have tons of stuff on my taskbar.
<prince-dari> >open something
<prince-dari> >never close it
<Nick> Sometimes tweetdeck if i'm watching a movie
<prince-dari> :D
<Nick> My entire taskbar now consist of steam, itunes, chrome, tweetdeck, fraps, and skype
<unfoundbug> @prince, a curse of the quad-core 8gb era, nothing ever closes
<unfoundbug> ever
<Nick> All of which are open
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I've found Firefox plays nicer with this netbook as of late
<Nick> I've got my 6 core
<unfoundbug> ooh nice
<unfoundbug> which chip?
<Nick> I'm going to up my ram soon
<Nick> Amd phenom
<SaxyPretender> 0,14you people and your fancy-schmancy multi-core
<Nick> Lemme check the specifics real quick
<SaxyPretender> 0,14;n;
<unfoundbug> amds never have enough low level cache for my taste
<Nick> Would you like a link? keep in mind, I'm building this with very little money
<unfoundbug> just get me the model number, i can find everything else fromt erhe
<Nick> X6 1100T
<unfoundbug> ooh the blacks are nice
<unfoundbug> clocked it or running stock?
<Nick> Yeah, that's probably the most expensive part of my computer
<Nick> Stock right now, but it doesn't need to clock.
<unfoundbug> why pay the extra for the black edition then?
<Nick> I plan on clocking it, just hjaven't gotten around to it, you know how it is.
<unfoundbug> fair enoguh
<unfoundbug> enough*
<unfoundbug> that chip looks like itll hit 4-5 easy enough with a nice sink on it
<Nick> I don't have liquid cooled or anything, but i've heard the fan installed can handle it.
<unfoundbug> liquid cooling is EXPENSIVE
<Nick> NO kidding
<unfoundbug> the liquid kits cost more than any peice of my machine
<Nick> I'll proably overclock it soon, i bought is specifically so it wouldn't go out of date in a year
<unfoundbug> so many adverts today...
<Nick> Yay adblock
<unfoundbug> lol, not played that since cata launched
<Nick> Also i'm too stupid to know how to overclock safely
<unfoundbug> its easy enoguh, jjust time consuming
<Nick> Any specific program you reccomend?

<Stallion_of_War> Fun Fact: Doom is actually the story of a guy who borrowed $2 from Chuck Norris and didn't pay it back on time

<Stallion_of_War> mein pretty friend has a tazer
<unfoundbug> thats pretty cool, whats the core voltage at?
<Stallion_of_War> The first thing I thought of when she showed it to me was "Wrek butt taze"
<otakon> Stallion_of_War: if she's pretty she probably needs it
<otakon> just remember
<otakon> anyone ever ask if you want a candy bar?
<otakon> run
<Nick> The core voltage is in the bios right?
<unfoundbug> yeah, if you havnt changed it then leave it as it
<unfoundbug> as is*
<Stallion_of_War> She doesn't think she's pretty :(. I think she's beautiful :)
<unfoundbug> the voltage is a dangerous thing to play with
<Nick> I messed with the built in overclocking settings
<Nick> It was all autpomatic
<Stallion_of_War> und apparently she thinks I'm awesome :)
<Nick> If it's holding at 60 with 100% load on 6 cores, surely i could go one step higher...
<unfoundbug> should be fairly good then, with temps of 60 you should be fine
<unfoundbug> dont push it so early
<Nick> But it's not worth it
<otakon> hmmmm
<otakon> well
<unfoundbug> how news the chip btw?
<Nick> Couple months old
<otakon> having to constantly go back to recharge seems tedious tbh
<unfoundbug> Yeah dont push it much harder
<unfoundbug> the paste might not have settled properly
<otakon> should have just put a recharge further along
<Nick> It's idleing at 37 now
<Stallion_of_War> I feel like, bleh
<Nick> Sweet, have a much better CPU now, in theory
<unfoundbug> lol, recharge further, as he is next to one
<unfoundbug> Nick, what GPU you got in there?
<Nick> Radeon hd 6770
<unfoundbug> i had one of those before, nice cards
<Stallion_of_War> I might need to just chillax today
<Stallion_of_War> Why is it so bloody hot?
<Nick> It's not as good as my CPU is, but it didn't cost hear as much.
*Stallion_of_War wonders where a thermometer is
<Stallion_of_War> Well, I think I'ma go lay down or take a cold shower or something.
<unfoundbug> why not just look up the weather online?
<Stallion_of_War> I ment to take my own temperature
<Stallion_of_War> I feel warm
<otakon> hmmmm
<otakon> why am I commenting on this map?
<Stallion_of_War> somepony feel my brow
<unfoundbug> Wrek asked for comments on it
<otakon> well taht's the thing
<Nick> There, everything is as it should be, time to resume my day.
<otakon> I don't know ANYTHING about Marathon and I thought that laast map he played that he beat was the whole game, not a fan map.
<Nick> My stream is laggin like a mofo, stupid rural internet
<otakon> I feel ya
<LunaTheBeloved> Same here
<LunaTheBeloved> I still enjoy country more than town though
<otakon> argh
<Nick> I'm going to name the little buffer cirlcle philip
<otakon> give me a city any day
<Nick> Hello again philip
<LunaTheBeloved> I can't stand living in the city.
<otakon> well, we got a tumbleweed here named Heely
<unfoundbug> Heh, if you ever make an OC, use it as your cutiemark
<otakon> you can see him drift by when the caht is dead
<LunaTheBeloved> I like the wide open area and privacy
<Nick> Ok, i'm not THAT rural
<otakon> Nick, I am
<otakon> I HATE it
<Nick> Either of you live in texas?
<otakon> I'm isolated and can't go now where, no car
<otakon> nope, eastern shore of MD
<LunaTheBeloved> No, Georgia
<otakon> in the middle of bucking nowhere
<Nick> I need to find a brony meetup in houston
<otakon> oh sure, we got a town 2 miles away but there is NOTHING there
<LunaTheBeloved> I live about 10 minutes from a small town.
<Nick> Maryland?
<otakon> yeah in MD
<otakon> on the eastern shore
<Nick> Maryland is hardley as rural as where i grew up
<otakon> ahem
<otakon> THE EASTERN SHORE
<ofna01> sorry guys
<Nick> We lived 6 hours away from any large city
<ofna01> im doin the dishes so i cant chat much
<otakon> it's 90% farms down here
<otakon> nothing but fucking fields and woods for miles at times
<LunaTheBeloved> Its 80% chicken farms around here.
<Nick> And how far were you away from D.C. 2 hours?
<otakon> Nick: try 3 if the traffic is good
<otakon> which it NEVER is
<LunaTheBeloved> Traffic is never good
<Nick> Ever
<otakon> so more like 4.5
<ofna01> derp
<Nick> The city we lived next to had traffic signals perfectly timed so that if you went exactly the speed limit, you hit every one.
<otakon> I think Wrek should have put a Rocket Launcher in this level
<otakon> lol Nick
<Nick> Not even kidding, i made a map and everything
<otakon> the only real challenge of this map
<otakon> oh there it is

<unfoundbug> 1,500*

<derpy_pony> it's not ultimate without naked ladies
<Jim> needs to get to 88 mph
<Wrek> 05never liekd the stormchaser series

<Jim> think they do this again some years later, but then they put a ramp on the end of the line
<derpy_pony> booo

<Ictiv> BackgroundPonies peak on occaison
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We're out of pig stomachs, but we do have human stomachs.
<derpy_pony> butcher shop
<MahBoi777> I used to eat em
<Ictiv> Sometimes multiple times with different voices
<Tovler> never had one. I don't even know what they are.
<Gold_Demona> lol very very meaty swimming cap
<derpy_pony> filled pig stomachs are a south german delicatesse
<Morty> I have a pony issue
<MahBoi777> ?
<Dashie_Dashie> Pop rocks are basically like ground up hard candy that fizzes in your moth
<Dashie_Dashie> mouth*
<Sumica> 00,10popricks are basicly Co2 and suger
<Morty> you know how Bon Bon doesn't recognize Rarity in the fluttermodel episode?
<MahBoi777> and if ya swallow em too early you're screwed
<EspyLacopa> He needs ALL the tubes!
<Dashie_Dashie> Sumica: Dat poprocks.
<Gold_Demona> Very yummy Co2 and sugar. =D
<Radu> And what they're trying to do? Stuffing a pig's stomach with pop rocks?
<Dashie_Dashie> ricks*
<Morty> How is that possible?
<Yellowquiet> they just have to hunt a pick
<Morty> she is the element of generosity
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They should call an organ bank.
<Wrek> 05oh well
<Morty> saved equestria

<MahBoi777> here piggy piggy
<unfoundbug> they use SOO many pigs
<Jim> They should just eat pop rocks and soda and see how it goes
<MahBoi777> lol
<Yellowquiet> XD
<Tovler> I'll have to keep an eye out for pop rocks.
<Gold_Demona> Anypony else hungry? =P
<Sumica> 00,10I wonder when they will show the ep where they acadentealy shot a cannon through some guys house
<Yellowquiet> best job eva
<MahBoi777> mentos + 2 Liter Soda= explosion
<Kencolt> OK. Drifted off to watch the review... did the car explode?
<unfoundbug> Sumica: thought that episode like the RFID tag was banned from being aired ever
<Yellowquiet> lol
<Yellowquiet> dat drum
<Sumica> 00,10could be, not sure as it just happed late last year and it takes times for them to edit the eps
<unfoundbug> yeah, usually a fair few months
<unfoundbug> we can be hopeful
<Kencolt> OK. Drifted off to watch the review... did the car explode?
<Sumica> 00,10no
<Gold_Demona> I thought their banned episode involved hamsters that ate each other
<MahBoi777> twice
<Jim> The car went wonderful
<Kencolt> Wow.
<unfoundbug> No, they was testing the myth that RFID was unbreatable,
<Yellowquiet> the car made a sonic rainboom
*Morty neighs with joy
<Morty> :)
<unfoundbug> then got some legal pressure to never air the results
<derpy_pony> it was a bit disappointing...12 seconds acceleration and that was it
<MahBoi777> lol
<unfoundbug> or anything to do with any of it
<unfoundbug> even had to remove tweets saying they were going to do it
<Gold_Demona> With the hamsters they were testing the myth that there's more nutrition in the cardboard box than the sugar cereal that's in it
<Morty> #SillyFilly
<MahBoi777> mmmmm, cardboard
<Gold_Demona> They had three different cages. The control with regular hamster food, one with sugar cereal, and one with cardboard pellets
<Sumica> 00,10dat blurry coke
<derpy_pony> humans can't digest cellulose like hamsters
<Kencolt> A qurat of Hydrocloric Acid.... this can't end well.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Only ever seen HCl called Muriatic acid one more place.
<Gold_Demona> The ones with the cardboard pellets started going nuts from hunger and ate each other
<MahBoi777> om nom nom
<derpy_pony> lol
<Yellowquiet> that must hurt
<Morty> Ictiv
<Gold_Demona> Give Mikey an antacid. XD
<Kencolt> I other words, belches and farts.
<MahBoi777> Beano

<Gold_Demona> doses
<Gold_Demona> Extreme scenario, ACTIVATE!!!
<Kencolt> I can think of no other program where the phrase "We're going to try to make out pig stomach explode" can be atken in stride.
<xcanox> Spam is for cowards. Spam makes you weak. Spam is for cleaning blood off that uniform and you don't get no blood on my uniform! Boy you must be outside your mind!
<Kencolt> Taken.
<MahBoi777> We gonna explode that pig hurhurhur!

<Davie_Jones> Companies might also have the power to strike at companies beyond the borders, but I don't know as I haven't read it.
<Davie_Jones> Just the ISP?
<MahBoi777> censors, censors everywhere

<MahBoi777> LOL
<nick> He should stream blink
<prince-dari> What are you talking about? THere's no Doctor after Tennant.
<otakon> ofc there
<otakon> IS
<prince-dari> Nope
<Shizuka> 13nope
<prince-dari> You must be mistaken
<otakon> we have PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE!
<DashWithRainbows> Nope
<otakon> too late
<Stallion_of_War> Denial. Matt Smith is hilarious. He wears a fez, fezes are cool
<DashWithRainbows> Photoshop otakon
<nick> But matt smith is a great doctor!
<Shizuka> 13daniel jackson for 11th doctor
<DashWithRainbows> Morgan Freeman for 11th.
<prince-dari> XD Shizuka
<MahBoi777> Hold it!, where's yo proof?
<prince-dari> Rowan Atkinson for 11th Doctor
<DashWithRainbows> ^
<prince-dari> He is so good in the sport relief episode
<otakon> yes he was and is
<nick> I can't believe you guys don't like moffats writing.
<Jim> I wouldn't be able to take Doctor Who seriously anymore if Rowan Atkinson became the next doctor
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> What's treaming?
<otakon> Dr. Who
<prince-dari> I don't always dislike the latest writing.
<otakon> a good ep too
<Fazana> MAEOOOARRRJMMMYYYY

<nick> I don't know what treaming is.
<MahBoi777> moffats?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Ahh, ok cool
<otakon> it's not the writing
<prince-dari> I never said that (though I hate the angel episodes after Blink)
<otakon> it's the actor
<diddutz> what a heroic scene O.o
<prince-dari> The shitty acting is what gets me. :/
<nick> So you don't like matt smith.
<prince-dari> >don't like
<otakon> he hates Matt Smith
<Radu> inb4 train runs him up
<EspyLacopa> Jack is everyone's type.
<prince-dari> Lul
<nick> But, he's acting the character
<Fazana> Matt isn't bad at acting, his script is bad IMO
<DashWithRainbows> Dari wants M.S to die.

<RainbowcrashNBurn> hmmm...it would appear i last saved mid battle subway run
<Tovler|nickfail> Pokemon 3DS had better do away with friendcodes

<fluttercry> 05,15friendcodes y u so long
<Yahooz> because nintendo
<Tovler|nickfail> Man, I am liking what I am hearing about the Wii U.
<NxPaqu> Is there something on right now? I've got a player in my window but every time I press play it does nothing.
<Dken2021> nintendo can't even grasp the power of the internet, you trust them with pvp?
<Dashie_Dashie> because nintendos were never really good at online.
<fluttercry> 05,15nothing's on at the moment
<Dashie_Dashie> >.>
<Dashie_Dashie> <,<
<NxPaqu> K, I thought my computer was screwing up
<pinkydash> soooo.... good idea
<pinkydash> bad idea
<pinkydash> o-o?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> for anyone who wants it, my pokemon white friendcode is: 2923-8263-6840
<MirrorImage> Dashie_Dashie - that's because Nintendo's focus on being a family console means they do everything they can to keep two people as separate as possible online
<Dashie_Dashie> if it's any relevence I nom on my goatee sometimes.
<Yahooz> mini tourney?
<Yahooz> over wifi?
<Yahooz> bad idea
<TopHat> mine's 5
<pinkydash> o-o why?
<Yahooz> It would be unfair
<pinkydash> how so?
<Cypresswolf> Catch the Scootaloo anyone? http://sparklepeep.deviantart.com/art/Catch-the-Scootaloos-276029156
<Yahooz> because I would win
<pinkydash> LOL
<fluttercry> 05,15Am I the only one that DOESN'T want the next gen of consoles to come out?
<Tovler|nickfail> E3 is gonna blow everyone's perception on nintendo
<Yahooz> and that ruins the fun
<Dashie_Dashie> I don't fluttercry.
<MirrorImage> it really depends what those consoles can offer fluttercry
<MirrorImage> (and if i can get a job)
<Dashie_Dashie> unless it's like fullblown throw you in the game 3d simulator.
<pinkydash> who knows, maybe someone on Bronystate could outmatch you o-o
<RainbowcrashNBurn> wii u graphics look awesome (considering its a wii)
<Dashie_Dashie> to hell with next gen
<pinkydash> ORRR we can play 3vs 1
<Yahooz> naw
<Chaospony> Hey guys. been a while.
<Yahooz> I would know if there was someone
<Phase4> http://derpy.me/Rldzh
<Yahooz> you know why?
<Dken2021> know how you feel, feels like this generation pretty much brought a whole lotta stuff
<Dashie_Dashie> Phase4, whats that link?
<fluttercry> 05,15Chaospony the name seems familiar
<Phase4> my attempt to work failed some more
<TopHat> I wish
<Yahooz> because I would know if they were on smashboards
<pinkydash> Why o-o
<NxPaqu> lol
<Phase4> Dashie_Dashie: image
<Yahooz> and that determines alot
<unfoundbug> fluttercry: why dont you want the next gen? this ones become so stagnant
<Dashie_Dashie> it gives me a warning when I go to it.
<Chaospony> Not surprised :T
<Phase4> Dashie_Dashie: huh, thats odd
<fluttercry> 05,15Because, 1) money 2) I really don't see the need
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i hope the next gen brings less CoD *shudders*
<Yahooz> its not just about who plays alot
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm fine with what we have right now
<MirrorImage> Dashie_Dashie - looks like poonibooru to me
<Yahooz> its about people who play alot and are aware of a higher level of game play
<Phase4> i tis
<Athena> That is an awesome flash game
<Phase4> it is'
<PartyCannon> 2 of the 3 consoles are glorified, underpowed, proprietary computers
<fluttercry> 05,15RainbowcrashNBurn You think Activision would EVER let that happen?
<Tovler|nickfail> My friendcode is 2022-0779-7103
<pinkydash> nods nods
*pinkydash has no idea what you're talking about
<PartyCannon> the other one is the same, but has exclusives worth investing in
<Yahooz> XD
<NxPaqu> I think graphics have gone as far as they can. You know those live action games that just feel wrong?
<fluttercry> 05,15FMV games...PHANTASMAGORIA
<Yahooz> basically there are a number of things that determine a good smasher
<unfoundbug> nxPaqu, they really havnt, so much of it is faked and not actually done in real time
<pinkydash> maybe they're under a different name o-o? on that board thingy
<Yahooz> maybe...
<NxPaqu> Meh, if they come out with something new, it better blow my mind.
<Yahooz> but then again i would still know
<unfoundbug> there are alot of really good lighting/shadowing techniques which there simply isnt enough power to do in real time
<Yahooz> i mean I once requested Wombo Combo on the stream
<Yahooz> you cant miss that
<Tovler|nickfail> There's still super-high resolution TVs, which Consoles will want to use and trick us into thinking we need.
<pinkydash> maybe they're offline :O
<fluttercry> 05,15look at Dark Souls, that game is beautiful. I really don't think a new generation could improve on that enough for me to consider buying it
<Yahooz> so be it
<NxPaqu> More 3D games would be cool, once 3D TVs become cheaper
<fluttercry> 05,15at least not in the beginning
<Randomnerd> Oh, by Celestia's Beard... there's a new show called "Doomsday Preppers".
*MakerDusk returns to #opers, seeing that his work has been done
<unfoundbug> lol, 3d is a terrible idea
<unfoundbug> ruins gameplay
<Yahooz> plus out of ALL the people that could be on here that are on smashboards,
<NxPaqu> Really? I haven't tried it yet, it just sounds cool
<Yahooz> im pretty sure a mere hundred could beet me
<Tovler|nickfail> But yeah, we've pretty much plateau'd when it comes to graphics. Game at this point will only look amazing if they have several hundred people working on the game.
<unfoundbug> I got it on my graphics card where it can force most games to run in 3d
<Yahooz> *beat
<unfoundbug> and i universally leave it off
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Tovler: did you get my friend code, if so ill meet you in wifi-room
<Yahooz> and the chances of that are slim
<unfoundbug> its great for films etc, the depth can add alot to a movie
<pinkydash> Lol
<Tovler|nickfail> RainbowcrashNBurn: Ok, I'll head there too
<fluttercry> 05,15I still feel that 3d is a gimick
<pinkydash> The GREAT AND ALL MIGHTY YAHOOZ
<otakon> it is
<pinkydash> VS
<pinkydash> BRONYSTAE
<RainbowcrashNBurn> oh my.... i did not think this through
<unfoundbug> but a game is too fast and needs too much finesse, and 3d takes away in terms of control
<Yahooz> yep XD
<Dken2021> it's always been a gimmick
<emangamer> Ok I think I'm going to stop lurking...
<pinkydash> this shall be a fun tournament indeed ^^
<RainbowcrashNBurn> my pla pad stuff has been deleted coz im using my 3ds instead of ds lite :O

<Yahooz> Melee would make my chances even more probable
