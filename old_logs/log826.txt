<Bronysith> yay~
<spitfirecolt> how was the episode. looks like we have a 2 weekwait till the next episode
<Bumblesweet> Not using the Linework layer?
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Ponies47
<Bronysith> spitfirecolt: it was weird
<Bumblesweet> Hoi Derpy!
<spitfirecolt> spike is best pony
<Ponies47> Hi DerpyMuffins
<cowvarkian> <_ <
<Ryunosuke> spitfirecolt: 3 week
<DerpyMuffins> Ah Wrek and his heavy metal
<Bumblesweet> I liked the episode because of the natural dialogue between the Mane 6.
<spitfirecolt> at least its better wait then 6 months
<GameTaco> Spike will always be best pony.
<DerpyMuffins> I never get tired of it
<spitfirecolt> i can't beleieve we are almost done with this season
<DerpyMuffins> 13 episode
<spitfirecolt> the episodes are flying by fast
<GameTaco> Seriously.
<Bumblesweet> It's episodic this season. There really isn't anything where you need to have seen the previous episodes.
<Sumica> 00,103 weeks gap followed by last 4 eps
<spitfirecolt> i hope for another season i don't want it to end that
<DerpyMuffins> Ehh
<DerpyMuffins> S3 isn't the best
<Sumica> 00,10then to be imeadeatly followed by mass drinking of the specal kool-aid
<GameTaco> Except Magic Duel, I guess. I never watched the first season, but the fandom talks about Trixie so much that I... Get the idea.
<Ryunosuke> inb4 speculation on S4 :p
<Paul> Gak!
<Paul> lol
<Bronysith> GameTaco: it is just fanservice ep
<GameTaco> Basically, yeah.
<Conyst> They already gave hints that they have stuff planned for MLP
<spitfirecolt> i made so many new friends because of the show i am afriad we will not hang out anymore when the show ends
<Sumica> 00,10and with that I go to sleep
<Ryunosuke> night sumica
*Bronysith joins Sumica
<Conyst> night Sumica
<DerpyMuffins> All S3 did was made a few things canon
<Ryunosuke> dream of ponies
<spitfirecolt> goodnite sumica
<GameTaco> And I guess Too Many Pinkie Pies made more sense to people already familiar with previous episodes written by Polsky.
<Lightning_Wing> Hello Everypony
<BladedWings> nite sumica
<DerpyMuffins> Night Sumica
<Conyst> hello Lightning_Wing
<Sumica> 00,10Wrek awsome looking tavi, sorry I cant stay up
<spitfirecolt> my fav canon is the theatre
<CountDoofus> Well... Magic Duel was planned for Season 2, so I'm not sure it was fan service.
<Ryunosuke> watching wrek draw, while mining ice
<Ryunosuke> -_-
<Bumblesweet> It was planned for Season 2?
<DerpyMuffins> Is that an orange cello?
<GameTaco> Yeah.
<Uboa-San> Wrek: Are you using iTunes for the Music?
<GameTaco> So... Trixie got backburnered.
<BladedWings> gonna go make some lunch, maybe play some xbox...:O SHINEDOWN~
<spitfirecolt> yet i feel derpy was left out this season
<AssertiveFluttershy> hey everypony! whats going on? :)
<Bronysith> ugh....
<GameTaco> In that regard, season 3 feels like a sort of season 2.5. Everything they couldn't cram into the 26 episode norm.
<Conyst> hello AssertiveFluttershy watching Wrek draw
<Bronysith> spitfirecolt: considering last seasons controversey, not surprised
<EPIC_luna> season 4 will have 15 episodes i thank
<AssertiveFluttershy> you sound depressed
*BladedWings sings along
<CountDoofus> AssertiveFluttershy: No ponies until Jan 19 :(

<Tovler> Fake talk, I'm glad Derpy's gone.
<Ryunosuke> no NEW pony episodes
<AssertiveFluttershy> ':P
<vIRCio-3429> automatically brought into bronystate upon logging onto the server eh..
<BladedWings> the episode number is off, isnt it?
<Conyst> Season 4 will have ponies. I just blew your mind.
<spitfirecolt> it is thats episode 10 not 11
<GameTaco> Yeah, they seem to be focusing on other background ponies to, well, put in the background. It keeps things interesting.
<BladedWings> thought so
<DerpyMuffins> That is starting to look like an awkward position
<AssertiveFluttershy> ':P
<GameTaco> In the season finale, it will be revealed that everypony is Bon Bon.
<BladedWings> that Octi + this song = :( dem feels
<spitfirecolt> if it was me as head writer i would make a lyra and bob bob episode about lyras love for humans
<DJ_Zypher> im starting a new playlist what should i listen to?
<EPIC_luna> season 5 will have 25 episodes i thank
<GameTaco> And that Bon Bon's real name is Sweetie Drops.
<spitfirecolt> bon bon
<Uboa-San> bon bon*

<DJ_Zypher> *where's
<Conyst> on the other side of the couch
<Uboa-San> DJ_Zypher: She just Isnt colored yet
<spitfirecolt> i imagine octavia and vinyl doing the scene from titanic
<BladedWings> ah ok
<DJ_Zypher> *vinyl peeks from behind the couch
<Conyst> spitfirecolt: I think it would actually be Lyra and Bon-Bon
<spitfirecolt> titanic redone mlp style would be awesome
<AssertiveFluttershy> so why did they meake the next episode so far apart from the rest?
<Bumblesweet> Pinkie is best pony!
<spitfirecolt> that would be awesome
<DJ_Zypher> just watched the beer add :)
<kidzrul732> hey bronies It's snowing outside my house
<AssertiveFluttershy> nice
<DinkyDoo> Bumblesweet: *Everypony is best pony.
<spitfirecolt> ah i hate snow used to live in ny
<GameTaco> They want us to *savor* what little pony we have left.
<AssertiveFluttershy> Thats what I loved about living there
<GameTaco> Heh, little pony.

<Bumblesweet> I love Fluttershy's part in today's episode. It was a totally natural entrance.
<spitfirecolt> if octavia was given a speaking role whose voice u think they should use. i would go with the epic wub time voice
<MilkyWhiskers00> spitfirecolt: She does have an voice though.
<Bumblesweet> Definitely a Trottingham accent.

<Afflict> What's OllyDbg?
<Gekoncze> I've neve heard of it
<MoistPonyNips> Will you teach me to Futbol?
<Gekoncze> *never
<Dark_Horst> i dont think you speleld that right
<Everto> I was joking
<Everto> It's a debugger
<MoistPonyNips> -_-
<Afflict> oh haha
<MLP_Brovakiin> .-.
<derpy_h> brb
<soulrider95> :S
<Everto> You put binaries or libraries in it and it disassembles it
<MoistPonyNips> How ironic is this?
<MLP_Brovakiin> dat name :s
<RaveBrony> God, I love the designwork.
<MoistPonyNips> "i dont think you speled that right"
<MoistPonyNips> "speled"
<RaveBrony> MLP_Brovakiin: Ikr?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, MoistPonyNips, mind chaning your name to something more...appropiate?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lies.
<RaveBrony> ^
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^^
<Everto> It analyzes it and allows you to do a bunch of cool stuff
<Dark_Horst> MoistPonyNips: speleld, splease
<pegashy> why was i kicked... :(
<Poshi> now hes free handing zoomed out. what a boss
<Everto> Lies?
<MoistPonyNips> Sorry for my name, guys. It's my Xbox gamertag... :D
<Stormy> Did you see the new episode yet SR?
<matttheshadowman> hello everyone, did I miss anything </luna>
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy no
<Stormy> It got leaked last night apparently
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I dont watch em in the morning.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> LOL
<bro> no
<MoistPonyNips> Just this magnificent work of art.
<Stormy> from itunes
<Dark_Horst> MoistPonyNips: if you gonna point my typos out, i expect you to not deviate from facts
<Everto> Anyway, you got any suggestions SR?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> suggestions for what
<MoistPonyNips> <3
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy I bet they do it on purpose.
<Everto> A keyboard
<matttheshadowman> yeah have to say this looks awesome
<derpy_h> waiting for movie night
<soulrider95> Steam, why you empty my wallet so fast :<
<Everto> My current one is dying
<Stormy> yeah, I was thinking that too
<pegashy> what did i do? :(
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> IBM model m
<bro> cause its a auction
<Kammerjunk> I still haven't used a single penny on the Steam Christmas sale.
<Stormy> it's happened way too many times now to be an accident
<Everto> Okay
<Kammerjunk> Mostly because I have nothing to spend.
<pyrocatboy> Hello everypony.
<MoistPonyNips> Just play Team Fortress 2. Free-to-play, and fun.
<Everto> I mean something that isn't 30 years old
<bro> me neither
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, pyrocatboy.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai pyrocatboy :)
<Poshi> yo
<pegashy> hai
<MoistPonyNips> Welcome. pyrocatboy
<soulrider95> I just got "They Bleed Pixels" and "The Walking Dead"
<Poshi> whats the first one?
<Poshi> oh wait
<Poshi> i have the internet
<Conyst> hello pyrocatboy
<Poshi> nvm
<MoistPonyNips> I have 2987 internets.
<Stormy> You probably don't have to put that much thought into a brand of keyboard, do you?
<soulrider95> Its like a combat/precision platformer that is fun and simple. but hard
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oi, MoistPonyNips, second warning, change your nick
<Everto> Yes
<Everto> I do
<Stormy> they're all pretty much the same
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://pckeyboard.com/page/category/UKBD
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> brand new
<MoistPonyNips> Okay everypony, I'm going to change my nickname.
<soulrider95> in lovecraftian style
<Everto> Woah what
<pegashy> always when i ask my parents something, they say 'google it'
<Stormy> and they're not even that expensive
<Everto> They make them new?
<Poshi> gunna lose those internets
<DerpyMuffins> I'm loving this Cello Wrek
<Conyst> lovecraftian style is best style
<derpy_h> ...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yes they are the most popular keyboard amoung programmers.
<derpy_h> back
<pegashy> hai
<soulrider95> I dunno man, steampunk is pretty awesome too
<pegashy> wb ^^
<derpy_h> steam punk
<Predator> I'm back.
<Everto> I'm not sure if I want a buckling spring though
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy mlp isnt even on itunes in canada.
<Predator> It's MoistPonyNips.
<derpy_h> hmmm
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I like mechanical keyboards.
<derpy_h> hai Predator
<pegashy> wb to you too ^^
<Conyst> steam punk plus lovecraft
<Everto> I do too
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> if you dont care for them, just grab whatever one you find at bestbuy.
<Stormy> People still uploaded it though
<soulrider95> steamcraft or lovepunk
<soulrider95> XD
<derpy_h> ...
<Tovler> that name made me think of that milk pony
<Predator> Bubblepunk.
<Poshi> im glad i came today. now i have something to replace this crappy gimp
<Kammerjunk> Feelin' lucky, punk.
<pegashy> does anyone here have an oc?
<penguin> bronystate: who the fuck just farted
<Predator> That's what I'm askin'.
<derpy_h> eeyup
<Everto> I'd prefer brown or blue mechanical
<Stormy> I don't even use itunes and I watched it already
<bro> me
<Tovler> hoof hearted
<Kammerjunk> Hell, I wouldn't know what I'd use an OC for.
<derpy_h> evryone has an oc
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I use itunes on my phone
<Predator> Roleplay?
<soulrider95> I don't. I am not creative enough
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> But because its convinent.
<pegashy> my oc's called melody :D
<Poshi> where did wrek pull that steam punk art from?
<Predator> I don't have one. all the good color schemes are taken, and I don't want to be unoriginal.
<Stormy> I would not pay $79 for a keyboard
<derpy_h> ah steam punk chello
<Kammerjunk> I don't draw, I cannot into music, I only write for fun, and I wouldn't RP as a single character.
<Everto> You would if it was sick
<Stormy> Nope
<Stormy> I never would
<Kammerjunk> The only creative thing I do is mess around in Blender and 3ds Max.
<matttheshadowman> So did anyone here watch the Christmas Doctor Who ep on Christmas Day... subtle pony reference...maybe
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I would because I like to use the same keyboard for a long time because I get used to it.
<derpy_h> brb
<rdibp> matttheshadowman: wat!?
<Everto> I'm using an apple aluminum one right now
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Ive been using shitty keyboards for a long time and I always replace them every few months because they start to suck
<DerpyMuffins> That is one fancy cello
<Stormy> I regularly switch between two completely differently sized laptops
<Stormy> so I have no trouble adjusting to keyboards
<soulrider95> for a fancy pony
<Everto> It's nice, but it's not mechanical
<pyrocatboy> Hello everypony.
<Predator> I like Appletavia.
<pegashy> the cello is preeeeeeeeeeeetty :)
<Poshi> yo
<matttheshadowman> well he had his Tardis on a cloud where he was living for a while
<Conyst> matttheshadowman: loved the episode
<Kammerjunk> DJ-T4VI is best ship.
<rdibp> :-O
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I hate the thin apple ones, I dont mind the thin keys when im on my laptop, but for a desktop… no.
<Stormy> I had no idea people even thought this much about keyboards. XD
<Conyst> I thought the pegasi gave him that cloud
<Everto> I like the thin keys, but I hate this keypad
<Predator> What's for Movie Night?
<DerpyMuffins> Not sure how clock gears fit into music, but alright
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I like to eat at my computer too so my keyboards tend to get all gross after a short period of time.
<Everto> I want a tenkeyless
<soulrider95> A move is Wall-E
<pegashy> my earplugs are donut-earplugs... so actually, i have donuts in my ears?
<Stormy> If I needed one I'd just buy the cheapest one at Target
<matttheshadowman> Conyst: yeah me too, did you find the Doctor a bit mopey in this though?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy they should teach about different keyboards in your pc classes, equipment is important :P
<Everto> Any advantage of a PS/2 over a USB?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> no
<Everto> Other than, like, pressing 50 keys at once
<Stormy> really?
<Conyst> matttheshadowman: it was completely understandable that he was mopey
<Stormy> I dunno, as long as I can type with it, I'm good
<derpy_h> ...
<soulrider95> so what did everyone think of the new episode? I found it REALLY sub-par compared to the rest of the episodes so far...
<PuebloDoG> The Doctor being mopey is normal, plus hello everypony
<Poshi> has this dude even looked at a chello once since we started this feed?
<Stormy> Never learned about keyboards in any of my classes
<pegashy> my tv-box thingy doesn't want to turn on -.- whaa! hate that!
<derpy_h> soulrider95: i think they mad spike a bit too incompetent
<Angel_Twilight_Song> Hi everypony :)
<Conyst> matttheshadowman: although I think we should stop talking about the new Doctor Who episode
<Everto> Well there are essentially 2 main types of keyboards
<pegashy> haiii ^^
<Poshi> im gunna go sit in an unartistic corner for a while
<Poshi> yo
<Predator> The ending looked like David and the goliath to md.
<Conyst> after all spoilers
<rdibp> soulrider95: i think it was sort of dull. I mean it was written by Merriweather Williams what did you expect?
<Conyst> hello Angel_Twilight_Song
<Everto> Cheapy cheap boring china made common pathetic plastic keyboards
<soulrider95> I found the character interactions the only redeeming part.
<Predator> There were many holes in the plot.
<Everto> And mechanical keyboards
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy you can spend as much on a keyboard as you do on a small laptop.
<Poshi> maybe hes a duel screen user
<derpy_h> wait so faust didnt make it
<soulrider95> I wasn't a fan of the CGI either.
<Tovler> Brady Bunch and Spongebob did it better.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> if you wanted to.
<Predator> Remember all the other times Spike's life was saved by the other ponies? There was no mention of the Dragon
<Angel_Twilight_Song> yea the writing seemed almost awkward and choppy
<Stormy> Well I would believe that
<Alchemist> are we talking about plot holes in a kid's show again?
<Predator> Code at all. It all suddenly appeared...
<GilDash> This song reminds me of something from Descent.
<rdibp> at least we know now that Rainbow Dash writes fanfics
<Alchemist> :D
<Stormy> the question is why though? :P
<soulrider95> the CGI just stuck out horribly. IMHO
<GilDash> Particularly Descent 3.
<derpy_h> Alchemist: sadly yes
<Everto> Because of the feel
<Stormy> I have no issues with my cheapy cheap boring china keyboards
<Everto> Do you know it?
<derpy_h> im giving it an meh 2.5
<Everto> Do you know that feel bro?
<Stormy> I don't know that feel bro
<Stormy> sorry
<Cajun> Predator: Negative Continuity. THis episode culd have happened before any of those.
<rdibp> i think the new episode deserves a 7/10
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> good equipment can increase your productivity.
<Predator> Well, Alchemist, I think that the writers are leaning towards writing for us Bronies.
<Everto> Yea
<Conyst> Predator: they only started learning about dragons not to long ago. He probably did not know of it before.
<Angel_Twilight_Song> the episode was funny, but the so-so writing made it hard to take seriously anyways
<Predator> And yes, Cajun, that is entirely true. Didn't think about that.
<soulrider95> I don't think writing for the bronies is a good idea...
<Alchemist> Predator: I didnt notice that in any way...
<Predator> Secret of my Excess?
<Stormy> I have a very hard time believing that my work will magically become better because of an expensive keyboard
<rdibp> Angel_Twilight_Song: well it was written by Merriweather Williams
<Stormy> but okay
<Everto> You will type faster
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I wont become better.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> it*
<Everto> Because your keyboard sucks less
<Everto> And you will get all the chicks
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> If your a shitty programmer, no amount of equipment will make it any better.
<pegashy> i wanna play sims so suddenly..
<derpy_h> ..
<rdibp> ...
<Stormy> Why would I want chicks? :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> To sell to meth.
<Predator> I would not have the patience to draw this.
<Stormy> I probably want them about as much as you do Everto
<Angel_Twilight_Song> rdibp: Yea Mw's episodes are usually the ones I'd call "average" because most mlp episodes are above average :)
<Everto> Are you saying
<Everto> You don't want
<Everto> chicks
<derpy_h> i wanna watch lunar eclipsed again
<Everto> http://narciejeter.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/baby-chicks.jpg
<Alchemist> have no problem with merryweather williams either, she wrote quite some nice episodes.
<Everto> Look at them
<Stormy> Not really
<RaveBrony> Im to picky to draw something this advanced.
<Predator> So watch it. It's on Youtube.
<Stormy> they'll grow up into chickens
<Everto> You are satan
<Stormy> and then what do I do
<Conyst> I want another Luna episode
<Poshi> i wish it displayed song title next to his logo
<RaveBrony> I still want a Celestia and Luna ep....
<Everto> Fine
<Everto> You will get all the souls
<Angel_Twilight_Song> Yea Meriwether Williams had been on a really good episode streak, but this episode kinda threw it off
<rdibp> I think Merriweather's best episode is Wonderbolt Academy
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Last ps2 rolled off the assembly line.
<Predator> Who do you guys think is a powerful singer?
<Alchemist> hearths warming eve was good too
<Everto> Yea
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I never owned a ps2.
<Everto> Shed a tear man
<Alchemist> and dragonquest
<Predator> I vote for Christina Aguilera. Love her work.
<Poshi> sweetie belle duh
<Everto> Because they're done
<derpy_h> Discorf ep
<Satan> nooo
<soulrider95> My theory is that they were semi-rushing it before the holidays :S
<RaveBrony> Oh god, Dragonquest is still my favorite Episode.
<Everto> More done than a steak at a crappy restaurant
<Satan> Now I might have to buy a new console
<RaveBrony> The feel, the adventure, and Rarity
<Angel_Twilight_Song> I just think that in this episode spike was kinda out of character.....
<Everto> And you ordered it medium rare, but the chef is an idiot
<rdibp> the timberwolves cgi was what took season 3 to long
<Poshi> mine is green is not your color
<Alchemist> soulrider95: the episodes were already finished mid summer I think
<Satan> btw Spyrorocks[Laptop]
<Poshi> i love photofinish
<Satan> I like to think I am not a shitty programmer
<Satan> :P
<rdibp> derpy_h whos Discorf?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I never claimed you were, i was just making a point about equipment.
<Everto> I'm a pretty shitty programmer
<RaveBrony> Photofinish? You mean RD? Hurr hurr hurr
<derpy_h> discord*
<linkkirby> hi ho is everypony
<Everto> Or at least I think I am
<derpy_h> ...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Your a shitty /ruby/ programmer.
<Everto> I've never really compared myself to a non shitty programmer
<Poshi> yo
<Conyst> hello linkkirby
<Predator> Who is Ho? And when did he/she become everypony?
<rdibp> bo
<Everto> I don't program in Ruby
<derpy_h> brb again
<Angel_Twilight_Song> hi
<Satan> I know
<linkkirby> lol
<Everto> I just wanted to create an argument
<Everto> I don't even know what ruby looks like
<Predator> Dinkleburg...
<matttheshadowman> yay my firefox window crapped out on me :(
<Satan> lololol
<Conyst> hi ho hi ho it's off to work we go
<Satan> So you don't actually think Ruby on Rails is awesome?
<linkkirby> lol gain
<Satan> thank goodness
<Poshi> ct.kirby is where its at just sayin linkkirby
<Satan> Now I don't have to hold a grudge
<Everto> I only know, like, half a dozen languages
<rdibp> Decalbuuuuuurg
<Everto> And what's it matter anyways
<Angel_Twilight_Song> :)
<Everto> I've done like, 5 things combined
<Alchemist> fight scene was great, the fake timberwolf scene was funny, the scene at Rarity's was good... I really think it was a good ep
<derpy_h> back
<bro> me have shiba inu puppy right now in hands its hard to type

<SirGanjalf> Yep, she's definitely a Mac
<Stankloid> Diabeetus

<kidzrul732> no cross this is Wall E
<Stormy> sad thing is they probably paid tons of money for them
<frisbeehat> Yay space!
<J_E_Smith71> Goess BnL bought out Apple and used their computers. In the future everything runs off a Mac
<Angel_Twilight_Song> thank the lord for abbreviations, imagine this movie being called waste allocation load lifter earth class
<Stormy> see ya Afflict
<EPIC_luna> im on the mooooon!!!
<Zacklego> kidzrul732 No they wont because they are in equestria and earth is a different planet entirely.
<Kammerjunk> For example, Eve's sleek design looks like an evolution of the boxy Apple II design.
<Gekoncze> cya Afflict
<Kammerjunk> That is, Wall-E.
<VenHur> No cross, this is Patrick.
<Michael> m-o :3
<SirGanjalf> will there be a restream after EMN

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> first of all I cant draw
<kidzrul732> see what i mean? This will be our future if we disrespect the environment
<Fl00t4sh41> EPIC_luna: Looka like regular muricans

<Kandarihu> Please assume the Party Escort Submission Position
<Azuredragon> I know that voice, cant remember the name

<rdibp> daaww
<SirGanjalf> and then he died
<Tassadork> indoctrination!
<kidzrul732> Did you know I saw this on earth day?
<Background_Pony> J_E_Smith71: It's entertainment.
<rdibp> LUNCH-IN0A0CUP

<VenHur> John Ratzanburg: The Voice of Pixar himself.
<SirGanjalf> Buy n' Large? More like "Butter n' Lard">_>
<Kammerjunk> So yes, the name of the ship is the Axiom. In math, an "axiom" is something unquestionable or something taken for granted.
<Dragonmatte> Ooh, blue!
<Michael> i liked blue before it was cool
<Stankloid> All must be blue
<Azuredragon> Red team forever

<Lilly> she is a hipster
<Kammerjunk> Actually, the floors are color-coded: Light blue for humans, white for robots workers, red for robot stewards.
<FlaschenJoe11> It may be blue. But it's no Zinthos
<rdibp> effaaaaaa
<Cyberlord1> now that every one is obese and lazy now i can start my reign as the overlord of all mankind
<pegashy> nvm, i'm back. brought my dog upstairs.
<Kotano> Scary thought: What does porn look like for the inhabitants of this ship?
<rdibp> :O
<Michael> lol
<Stankloid> Its all holograms

<derpy_h> ...
<Kammerjunk> Many of the robots in this film are voiced by one man: Ben Burtt. When Andrew Stanton, the director of Wall-E, met with Burtt, he told him "I need you to be 80% of my cast!"
<EPIC_luna> GET UP
<All_the_homestuck> Is it weird that I ship him with glados?

<Kammerjunk> In fact, for the filmic look, the animators brought in some vintage Panavision cameras from the 1970s. Just because Pixar has some of the most dedicated sons of mothers in animation.

<LordDerpington> rdibp: Pixar typically takes about 4-5 years on a movie, start to finish.
<VenHur> And they put a auto self destruct sequence, why?
<All_the_homestuck> NOO
<Barbetos> Using an escape pod, with self distruct, to ged rid of one little plant seems a BIT excessive.

<Kammerjunk> rdibp: Well, the concept for Wall-E came from the famous lunch in 1994. From this lunch was born Wall-E, A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc. and Finding Nemo. However, production of this film wasn't until after Stanton completed Finding Nemo in 2003.
<All_the_homestuck> PLANT

<rdibp> Pixar is an underrated company
<Buytoast> they aren't
<RarityDiamondBelle> Newman Thomas is underrated
<Buytoast> and a crossover would be terrible
<VenHur> Spark = Kiss? Most likely.

<pegashy> my dog is scared
<All_the_homestuck> A113
<Barbetos> Dragonmatte sounds about right. That 5 year cruise is on valve time.
<All_the_homestuck> Every movie.
<Barbetos> XD
<derpy_h> ...
<Kandarihu> Cyberlord1, if Disney movies exist in the aftermath of a global monopoly ruined the Earth, it's likely Buy n Large bought out Disney. They probably also bought out Valve and everything else. So maybe Half-Life 3 did come out.
<Kammerjunk> Look at that. A113. In every single Pixar film.
<All_the_homestuck> A113
<RarityDiamondBelle> suddenly he's a villain...
<derpy_h> skynet
<Kammerjunk> And a lot of Disnet animated films.
<Sundaysmile> AEIOU
<pyrocatboy> open pod bay doors
<pegashy> he is now hiding under my bed
<SirGanjalf> "I'm sorry, Captain. I'm afraid I can't do that."
<Kammerjunk> Disney*
<Sundaysmile> JOHN MADDEN
<VenHur> Dat A113. It's an easter egg thing in Pixar movies.
<rdibp> FOOTBALL
<Angel_Twilight_Song> if you could relate the characters in Wall-e to ponies, which ponies would they be?
<pony_6548> AEIOU
<Barbetos> Just taze him
<SirGanjalf> uh oh
<RarityDiamondBelle> A113?
<Barbetos> and then play it off
<Algent> starrre
<RarityDiamondBelle> huh
<Dragonmatte> TOP SECRET
<rdibp> what does A113 mean?
<Wither> why soo much advertising
<Sniper> Did I miss it?
<pony_6548> snaaaaaaaaaaaakee
<Rainbow_Glasses> Cave Johnson here
<Kammerjunk> Fun fact: AUTO's directive, A113, comes from Room A113 at Cal Arts where a lot of Pixar animators learned their craft.
<Algent> directive A113
<Cyberlord1> VenHur: explain this to me mortal
<Sniper> I fell asleep on my laptop
<Barbetos> A113 means that the g word that must not be said has taken over.
<Kammerjunk> Also, look. AUTO only complied when ordered. "A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law."
<Kotano> Angel_Twilight_Song: WALL-E = Derpy , Eve would probably be Rarity
<pegashy> cleanup ass>?
<J_E_Smith71> Angel_Twilight_Song: Fashion bots=Spa ponies
<Lilly> and be fat
<LordDerpington> A113 was the room number of the classroom where John Lasseter and Brad Bird studied character animation.
<rdibp> i think A113 is the pixar conference room?
<pony_6548> dat texttospeach
<rdibp> A113
<SirGanjalf> Live fat and prosper
<Kammerjunk> rdibp: No, it's a room at Cal Arts.

<VenHur> Cyberlord1: Well, it's hard to say, but A113 is an production room in Pixar Animation Studio.
<rdibp> whats to see Monsters inc. 3-d

<pony_6548> yes it's tottaly texttospeach
<Kammerjunk> Also, if you noticed the list of Axiom captains earlier, their likeness are from Pixar writing team members, which should say something about that team. The years stated was term of service, the average of which is 135 years. This adds up to 666.
<Stankloid> JAY-SON!
<Alchemist> Sigourney Weaver announcing activating airlock disposals? How ironic :D
<remdog> Wall R
<Angel_Twilight_Song> In the origanal version of this scene, it was eve who was damaged, not wall-e
<rdibp> #JASON
<Stankloid> JAAASON!

<RarityDiamondBelle> RUN RUN RUN
<`Xenu> AEIOU
<Stankloid> Go Moe!
<bl1tz> MUST CLEAN!!!!!!!!
<Kandarihu> Wait a minute. Why is the Axiom disposing of so much trash? There's no WAY a ship can be drifting through space while sustaining a large number of civilian passenger's comfortable living standard if everything gets thrown out.

<Lightning_Wing> SPRITES!
<Rainbow_Glasses> Sooo. Did anyone ever see Frankenweenie?
<Cyberlord1> Cars 2
<bl1tz> what the next movie tonight?
<PONY> Brave was downhill from thsi
<Kandarihu> I might as well give this a 9.9/10
<Michael> all that from a boot :d
<matttheshadowman> Errr Cars 2 and Brave are downhill... good but not the greatness Pixar once was
<`Xenu> boot root
<Kotano> I just noticed, I never saw the end credits.
<Sniper> BOOTIS
<Gamer_Luna> What's the name of the song?
<Algent> And Cars2 was good for adults but too complex for kids
<Kammerjunk> Algent: Fair enough, Brave wasn't the best.
<`Xenu> boot root
<RarityDiamondBelle> only one song...
<FlaschenJoe11> 8-bit Graphics.
<SirGanjalf> Pixel art:D
<pony_1242> discord is gonna return in the next episode!:D
<Lilly> 8 bit robots
<Tovler> Secret of Kells > Brave

<DerpyMuffins> Hey Wrek, you got the Burn-E short?
<Lightning_Wing> TWINKIE!!!
<Kammerjunk> Yes, from Impressionists to early video games.
<Rainbow_Glasses> Twinkie pie
<J_E_Smith71> bl1tz: Christmas Do Over
<VenHur> Cars was also downhill because of its bizzare concept.
<remdog> Down to Earth, Gamer Luna.
<Sundaysmile> WHO'S FOOTPRINTS ARE THESE?
<killerpony7733> pony_1242 .......spoilers you twat
<Lilly> looooool
<pony_6548> i want to live in gaben world

<Algent> Burn-e ?
<frisbeehat> and Chrysler ad..
<All_the_homestuck> 8-BIT HAOLY SHIET
<pony_1242> oh
<RarityDiamondBelle> Cars 2 was just terrible
<killerpony7733> Mod pony_1242 just made spoilers
<RarityDiamondBelle> GO AWAY AD
<All_the_homestuck> Level up.
<matttheshadowman> Yes but Cars 2 was completely unneeded... the merchandise sales were enough surely!
<pony_1242> IM SORRY FORGIVE ME!
<Lightning_Wing> LOL :D
<pony_6548> cars was 5/10
<Kammerjunk> Get an adblocker, jeez.
<RarityDiamondBelle> O_O
<Simon_Petrikov> Get ad block RarityDiamondBelle
<LeGoMeEGGO> credits summarize story in 8bit graphics :D
<Barbetos> Benny hill theme goes here.
<pony_6548> GET ON WITH IT
<Tovler> Doc Hollywood > Cars
<Dark92Enigma> The Enigma's review of WALL-E: This movie is just brilliant, both visual and plot driven. The characters are adorable (well, except the enemy ones) and reek charisma. The setting is wonderful, and the message they were going for was perfectly delivered. Truly an instant classic of cinema 10/10
<matttheshadowman> I'd give Cars 6/10 but Cars 2 is at best a 3/10
<Algent> Adblock plus work well on ustream
<pony_1242> CRUSH KILL DESTROY
<Kammerjunk> I have 7 adblockers and trackblockers. What are these 'advertisements' thou speakest of?
<RarityDiamondBelle> I can imagine the mane six singing this.
<bl1tz> never seen cars 2 but cars wasnt too bad
<BlitzWing00> I felt the problem with Cars 2 was it was focused too much on that tow truck.
<pony_6548> Kammerjunk, have you cockblocker?
<Dark92Enigma> matttheshadowman: Raritydiamond ikr?
<Kammerjunk> pony_6548: ...Yes.
<Barbetos> Yaaay
<Verdant_Wasp> well, they kinda shove their message down your throat
<Barbetos> He killed dem guys!
<VenHur> RIP Justin Wright.
<Kandarihu> Kammerjunk, the stuff that keeps websites running without forcing it's users to pay for the services themselves.
<pegashy> i'm tired....
<pony_6548> oh well .then it's ok
<Simon_Petrikov> This makes me want to go play Portal 2.
<PONY> Bronies which were the ones to be expected to forgive and forget: Bronies or Anons?
<RarityDiamondBelle> Cars 2 was overrated.
<matttheshadowman> yes Cars 2 also seemed to want to be a James Bond spoof as well
<pegashy> and hungry
<Wither> Like a Boss! :[
<LeGoMeEGGO> it really was
<Barbetos> Justin Wrong got him VenHur, his evil twin.
<Barbetos> From his evil twin family.
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: Oh relax, I can disable them for individual sites. These ads aren't exactly helping BronyState.
<Dark92Enigma> matttheshadowman: they also wasted BRUCE CAMPBELL
<pony_6548> sooo there is no derpy in season 3?
<pegashy> i need more soup
<matttheshadowman> Actually cars 2 wasn't overrated at all, the critics panned it
<pony_6548> cus retartds?
<Lightning_Wing> dang ads
<J_E_Smith71> The 8-bit Twinkie looks like ROB's head
<`Xenu> more pizza plants
<Kandarihu> Kammerjunk, but they're helping Ustream.
<pony_1242> CRUSH KILL DESTROY SWAG!
<pony_6548> SWAG
<Barbetos> Nope.avi
<bl1tz> Anons are usually all trolls... well all the ones i've met have been...
<Buytoast> goddamn can't even watch Wall-E without these people trying to shoehorn horses into everything
<Dark92Enigma> pony_6548: i saw her, but by the side, not her full face
<Kandarihu> I really shouldn't be complaining about it though. I have adblockplus running too.
<Lilly> CRUSH. KILL. DESTROY. PLANT.
<Fl00t4sh41> matttheshadowman: Cars 2 was massively overrated. Critics should have condemed it even harder than they did
<Barbetos> bl1tz but.. as far as I am concerned you are a anon.
<Barbetos> So is everyone else
<CCharmanderK> Hey, everypony. Enjoy the new episode earler?
<CCharmanderK> *earlier
<pony_1242> yes
<frisbeehat> I loved it :3
<Alchemist> yep
<Barbetos> Si.
<pony_6548> yes
<VenHur> I swear tro god, if they made Cars 3, which is most likely can happens like Toy Story's, I'm going 14th Century on their sorry asses.
<`Xenu> yeh
<RarityDiamondBelle> Next movie?
<Gamer_Luna> we are all Anons
<Barbetos> It was good.

<FlaschenJoe11> CCharmanderK: yeo
<Michael> hai CCharmanderK ! i loved the ep :D
<Lightning_Wing> i hope hey make a WALL-E 2
<Gamer_Luna> with names
<RarityDiamondBelle> yes
<Dark92Enigma> Verdant_Wasp: at least it was more subtle than Captain Planet
<PONY> Broneis are sort of descendants of Anons (the group)
<Tovler> overall 4/10 is pretty much condemning it.
<pony_6548> spikexAJ is best shipping
<Lilly> clean, mo, cleancleancleancleancleanclean
<`Xenu> aeiou
<klarinetist> Must clean
<mitamaking> Alright in time for episode

<CCharmanderK> FOREIGN CONTAMINANT
<pony_1242> i just watched the new episode before i got here
<Gamer_Luna> WOO
<matttheshadowman> I guess... still Cars 2 didn't make me walk out of a theatre... the US CGI Astro Boy did though
<RarityDiamondBelle> I want a mo cleaning game
<Dark92Enigma> Lightning_Wing: i don't think there should be a second movie
<Angel_Twilight_Song> It said Production Babies in the credits. Wat? :D

<klarinetist> Winter Wrap Up!!!!
<Michael> winter wrap up <3
<Verdant_Wasp> Winter Wrap Up !
<CCharmanderK> Cars 2 was a good movie. I see why a lot of people don't particularly care for it, but it's not a bad film.
<LordDerpington> Yay!
<All_the_homestuck> ITS CHRISTMAS!
<Dark92Enigma> She is your mommy
<J_E_Smith71> Oh Wrek you skipped a gag in the Pixar logo
<jcelios> Angel_Twilight_Song: babies born during the production of the movie to production crew memebers
<PONY> Who said imperialism is bad?
<Alchemist> Angel_Twilight_Song: its the babies of the makers who were born during the production of the movie
<Dark92Enigma> basically
<Lightning_Wing> who is his mommy?
<Rainbow_Glasses> Winter wrap up you say??
<All_the_homestuck> YEAHH
<VenHur> Lightning_Wing: WALL-E as a trillogy...No thanks. I prefer as a standalone, Up too.
<Gamer_Luna> It's gonna get stuck in my head again...oh no
<Kammerjunk> VenHur: Yeah, ditto.
<Dark92Enigma> Twi you look so adorable dressing up
<Kammerjunk> ^
<Kammerjunk> But Steven Magnet is still best pony.
<pony_6548> dat saddle
<All_the_homestuck> its bullshit
<Michael> ^^^
<Lightning_Wing> lol
<matttheshadowman> YAY!!!! One of my fav eps... the song was one of the reasons i love this show so much!
<RarityDiamondBelle> awh man,she reminds me of one of my ocs Starbeam
<Tovler> Finding Nemo 2. How will that work?
<Dark92Enigma> TOO early.........:D
<SirGanjalf> matttheshadowman: They gone bankrupt, but someone is going to buy them
<CCharmanderK> There aren't any humans in Equestria, so the saddle is probably kind of kinky.
<Lightning_Wing> wheres the snow?
<Alchemist> Wow, animation did improved noticeably since S1.
<Gamer_Luna> Fuffy saddle is fluffy
<FlaschenJoe11> Hundreds of Years. Granny Smith is older than Ponyville. Granny Smith is hundreds of years old.
<Simon_Petrikov> LOL
<RarityDiamondBelle> AHHHHHHHHH
<J_E_Smith71> Too early they didn't draw the snow yet
<`Xenu> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH
<Simon_Petrikov> That always makes me laugh.
<pony_6548> i like how she wear nothing at all but saddle
<SaxyPretender> 0,14which is why I was basically just watching movie without chat
<pony_6548> well all horses really do...
<CCharmanderK> The only thing I wasn't too thrilled about the episode: CG Timberwolves.
<VenHur> But as for the Incredibles, most likely, because at the end of the film, they're about to fight The Underminer.
<Kammerjunk> FlaschenJoe11: Yeah, she's a Highlander.
<pegashy> freeeeeeeendzz
<RarityDiamondBelle> faithful and buffer
*Gamer_Luna dances
<Shadowlost> @Simon Your name is most excellent
<Dark92Enigma> J_E_Smith71: PHYSICS!
<mitamaking> I'll admit I am here for the song
<Wrek> 05as for the timber wolves
<pony_6548> and saddle dissapered
<frisbeehat> alright, I'm out. Enjoyed the movie, hope you bronies have a good rest of the day and a happy new year!
<Wither> Fluttershy is the BEST Pegasus EVER
<vanemare> Wakes up too early, still has to run to get there in time.
<Simon_Petrikov> Shadowlost: thanks
<LeGoMeEGGO> no more winter clothes....
<matttheshadowman> Still what has THQ got these days lastv game I got with vtheir name on it was Conker's Bad Fur Day on N64 in the UK (THE Games or Nintendo UK wouldn't publish it here)
<Wrek> 05i can see why they did it and its perfectly reasonable
<RarityDiamondBelle> @VenHur: wished it didn't end at a cliffhanger
<LordDerpington> Take care, frisbeehat
<Verdant_Wasp> though the brotherly combination Timberbot was funny
<Dark92Enigma> Wrek: i didn't spoil anyth---OH, OK
<PONY> FlaschenJoe11: 100 moons = 100 Months = ~8 Years
<FlaschenJoe11> CCharmanderK: They looked more Cel-Shaded to me. And it help make them seem more unnatural and evil.
<Wrek> 05but i wopuld prefer the look of using individual flash elements
<All_the_homestuck> YAAY
<RarityDiamondBelle> I would be on the animal team.
<mitamaking> Hi Bonbon

<Kandarihu> Man, before today, when was the last time Wrek streamed Euro Movie Night?
<RarityDiamondBelle> Lyra.
<PONY> FlaschenJoe11: Did you count the photos from Family Reunion episode?
<CCharmanderK> But the original Timberwolf designs in Family Appreciation Day were perfectly fine. Why didn't they use those?
<All_the_homestuck> Spike doesnt give a fuck.
<matttheshadowman> Wrek: Hey it reminded me or Futurama and that's never a bad thing
<RarityDiamondBelle> Over Obsssed Lyra

<J_E_Smith71> The reason why people vote for this ep
<pony_6548> <- here
<RarityDiamondBelle> Even though i love these boots this fashion getting old
<Simon_Petrikov> Tovler: obviously.
<Sundaysmile> This quality is why we loved this series
<Dark92Enigma> WINTER WRAP UP, WINTER WRAP UP--------

<Shadowlost> Wait... If they control the seasons...
<CCharmanderK> Winter Wrap-Up, Winter Wrap-Up!

<mitamaking> Winter Wrap Up
<FlaschenJoe11> PONY: Twilight said "Tradition for Hundreds of years". This was specifically about Ponyville. Granny Smith was in Ponyville back when they founded it,
<Michael> doctor :D
<RarityDiamondBelle> Winter Wrap Up Winter Wrap UP!
<Shadowlost> Why would they ever let it be winter?
<PONY> Winter is necessary
<Shadowlost> No it's not
<Kammerjunk> That's what you get for being in mane chat, though.
<PONY> FlaschenJoe11: ikr.
<pegashy> yay!
<All_the_homestuck> DERPY
<CCharmanderK> Oh, I haven't heard this song in ages. Nostalgia~
<Kammerjunk> Especially on a Friday or Saturday.
<Sundaysmile> because everthing needs to sleep sometime Shadowlost
<vanemare> Shadowlost: because so they can ice skate
<PONY> FlaschenJoe11: figure of speech?

<VenHur> No matter how much I love this episode...It feels like it's overshadowing all of the other episodes, alongside with "Smile Smile Smile" and it's episode. I'm not being negative however.
<pony_6548> APples
<matttheshadowman> The animation in this is incredible for a first season ep as well :)
<somepony_8999> CELERY

<VenHur> It seems that all of the Bronies, even I myself included, started to watch the show around the time 4chan spreaded it like superglue, and the news that John De Lancie was the voice of Discord.
<FlaschenJoe11> Simon_Petrikov: She's Pinkie Pie.

<DerpySenkon> atleast he has his priorities straight
<Vordox> <-- I tried that hand stand...
<Vordox> IT

<Stormy> I had this http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2011/12/6827fe925abf58855c3322d1142b8ae2.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> his mad skills will break the space-time fabric and free him
<Tovler> Kevin Federline is my favorite white-people dancer
<Dark92Enigma> IF TIM BURTON WANTS BREAKDANCING IN ALICE IN WONDERLAND...........this is possible
<Barbetos> This movie should also be named respawn.
<Stormy> it was awesome
<Afflict> Does anyone remember that digimon thing or whatever it's called?
<Kandarihu> Barbetos, Christmas respawn?
<J_E_Smith71> Out of all the Christmas TV films this had to win. At least I voted for Very Merry Muppet Christmas. Sure it's a Wonderful Life spoof, but it would have been more fun to watch than this
<Stormy> Digimon? The show?
<KingMeth> Noooo
<LadyCanary> It's A Wonderful Life is a lovely movie.
<Afflict> No it was a handheld thing
<VenHur> I loved both of those movies.
<Afflict> It was a long time ago, so I don't remember too much about it, but it was a lot of fun
<Stormy> Never seen it
<VenHur> But i'm sorry, but Home Alone 1 and 2 are the shit.
<LadyCanary> This Todd guy looks like a real cunt.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I had digimon cards in elementary school
<Stormy> I only watched Digimon a few times
<Wither> Yo Bronies and Ponies !
<J_E_Smith71> VenHur: I voted for BOTH of those too
<VenHur> So it's down to four movies.
<wipergone2> lol
<Stormy> and had no idea what was going on
<Kammerjunk> LadyCanary: Welcome to ABC.
<Kandarihu> Has anyone seen the Jim Carrey version of A Christmas Carol? That's one awesome take on the story.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I never understood any of the tv shows that had card games and I never watched them
<Stormy> And I made fun of it for ripping off Pokemon
<Deadlypon3> LadyCanary he proposes to his girlfriend in front of her ex-husband ^^'
<Iwa> LadyCanary: According to the movie, he isn't...but I don't like his eyes and face, so meh, I don't care :P
<Tovler> Todd should stay in the shadows
<Dark92Enigma> LadyCanary: IKR? but instead we have this piece of dogs***
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I just got the cards because everyone else had them.
<Dark92Enigma> OH ANOTHER PEAS ON EARTH JOKE, right?
<Vordox> OH
<Vordox> GOD
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: and he saved his life
<Vordox> He planned THIS?!
<LadyCanary> >Pea Diddy.
<Buytoast> Pea Diddy
<Dark92Enigma> BULLSHIT
<Buytoast> why
<Kandarihu> Pea Daddy?
<VenHur> What about A Charlie Brown Christmas, Frosty The Snowman, Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, and How The Grinch Stoles Christmas?
<LadyCanary> ...
<Deadlypon3> twilight_sprinkle ...So he's an idiot
<Dark92Enigma> OH GOD NO
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Oh my god...
<Kandarihu> Pea Diddy
<J_E_Smith71> Nice way to cover that it's a stunt dancer
<Kammerjunk> Hah. 'Pea Diddy'
<Silver_Spoon> ad diddy's peas on earth?
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Dat pun hit the spot
<Stormy> my friend tried to get me to like it
<LadyCanary> ....
<bl1tz> :O
<Graywolf71> ...... O_o
<Dark92Enigma> LadyCanary: same here
<Dark92Enigma> .........
<Sandvich> Da shet gansta nigg'
<LadyCanary> I....I....
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: why? todd saved his life
<VenHur> ....
<KingMeth> yugioh FTW
<LadyCanary> THIS GUY. IS KING OF THE WHITE PEOPLE
<pony_6548> it's GAAAAAAAAAAMEEBROOO
<Stormy> I liked Lord of the Rings because everyone else did though
<Buytoast> This movie just cranked it up to 11
<VenHur> ....I prefer Pig Power In The House...
<Vordox> LadyCanary: Dat ain't much :P
<Kammerjunk> Funnily enough, you couldn't see his face.
<wipergone2> king of da peas
<Stormy> It became a fad when I was in 5th grade
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I never actually bought cards for any card game, I collected them because people kept giving me some.
<Stormy> becuase the movie came out
<Nyst> pea diddy...
<Kammerjunk> Buytoast: But it only goes to 10!
<Deadlypon3> twilight_sprinkle he's willing to save his life and yet doesn't know that proposing to his ex wife in front of him isn't hurting him!?
<Dark92Enigma> LadyCanary: He even out-whites VAINILLA F****** ICE?
<EPIC_luna> like a boss
<pony_6548> http://imgur.com/xkJGs really i can't handle this twilight furr
<DJ_Zypher> LEVEL UP!
<pony_6548> i need her
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and I didn't ever have the slightest clue on how to play the games
<DerpySenkon> it was just one day the day so has he truly still saved his life
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I just had the cards.
<DerpySenkon> the day reset*
<J_E_Smith71> VenHur: All classics, though the hour specials probably weren't long enough to vote for
<Vordox> Arthur won....what?
<LadyCanary> Well that wasnt predictable enough.
<Lil_B> ohey Vordox
<Stormy> I have no idea how to play the pokemon TCG either
<Vordox> Lil_B: Hai
<Tovler> Goodness me, or should he say goodness pea
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: he didnt realize it would hurt him, after he saved his life he said he wouldnt propose to her because it hurts him
<Oscarmikefoxtrot> i need the lord of the rings tune
<Dark92Enigma> WOW, SO PREDICTABLE
<Stormy> but I have tons of cards
<Vordox> OH GOD
<Buytoast> ahaha
<Afflict> I have a bunch of yugioh cards. I have no clue where they came from though :P
<Vordox> ANGRY STARE JESUS
<alexxm|colt> jesus confirmed for evil
<J_E_Smith71> As a troll move maybe in July I'll vote for Rudloph and Frosty'sChristmas in July:p
<Stormy> my mom got rid of all mine
<VenHur> J_E_Smith71: OH MY GOD, Who, the hell, cares?
<Tovler> As Tim Allen once said. Never give up; Never surrender
<pony_6548> peas
<Stormy> But I found a bunch of them at a thrift store for a dollar
<Silver_Spoon> Todd: he was there, too
<Stormy> and had to buy them
<Deadlypon3> twilight_sprinkle ...Why are you so defensive? Your right, but still
<Kandarihu> alexxm|colt, The Hendersons were the evil who were defeated.
<Alpha> Hmm
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> when I had pokemon cards my mom said they were the devil.
<KingMeth> Kimori, what did you play?
<Stormy> LOL oh great
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but she didn't take them away.
<Stormy> I remember when that was going around
<KingMeth> The Devil SR?
<Dark92Enigma> J_E_Smith71: EVEN JACK FROST is more entertaining.....or SANTA MUSCLES. it's cheesy but it has THE HULKSTER
<KingMeth> lol
<Lil_B> Vordox the Tail Movement is getting smoother, but It#S still a bit erm... you see like 2 phases
<Vordox> Granny on fire. :P
<Vordox> Lil_B: Let me see. :)
<J_E_Smith71> VenHur: Who cares they are too short to vote for?
<Kandarihu> How about this movie vs Surviving Christmas?
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, take the kid to the pub.
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: im not defensive, i just dont like it when people rush to claim something without properly thinking it over
<Stormy> Lambda told me a story about when his parents got one of those propaganda things in the mail explaining the evil of Pokemon
<Kammerjunk> That's a child-friendly habitat.
<LadyCanary> ....Easy Bake oven ;^;
<Stormy> he cried when he saw it
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> My mom also didn't let us drink Cherry or Vanilla Coke because the terrorists were poisoning it.
<Stormy> And his parents had to comfort him and say it wasn't evil
<[Alpha]> :S
<bl1tz> :D
<Lightning_Wing> Oh my gosh the chat server hates me sometimes
<Tovler> Yep. That is one fine looking Bar-be-que pit...
<Stormy> wut
<LadyCanary> Oh, excuse me. FUN BAKE OVEN.
<Stormy> that's a new one
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> But normal coke is fine.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> hahaha
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> My mom is awesome and funny.
<Kandarihu> It's black now
<[Alpha]> :D
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> We have some good arguments all the time.
<Sandvich> DED
<VenHur> J_E_Smith71: It does not matter about the length, they're classics in any forms of length.
<Lightning_Wing> XD
<DerpySenkon> more like bun make loven?
<Stormy> my mom hates arguments
<Dark92Enigma> DED
<[Alpha]> eas bake my plot
<Sandvich> WHAT?
<LadyCanary> This guy. Is also the Duke of Spaghetti.
<[Alpha]> easy
<Deadlypon3> I don't get this
<KingMeth> lol
<Stormy> when I used to contradict her as a teenager she'd just run away and go "I don't want to talk about this anymore"
<Deadlypon3> HOW THE FUCK DID HE DO THIS IN ONLY A HALF HOUR
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> We can argue without taking it personally and holding a grudge just because one of us was wrong.
<Deadlypon3> Without anyone noticing?!
<Kencolt> A real EasyBake oven was a metal box inside a plastic box with a lightbulb. And they WORKED.
<Stormy> to be fair I was pretty pushy
<J_E_Smith71> Deadlypon3: Guess he praticed on the loops
<Stormy> So I don't entirely blame her
<Kammerjunk> Deadlypon3: He probably didn't, he probably did it over weeks.
<Dark92Enigma> Deadlypon3: because.......this movie sucks?
<LadyCanary> Kencolt: My little cousin got one for Hanukah. And I concur.
<pony_6548> science!
<KingMeth> lolercopter
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I like to think we are reasonable people.
<J_E_Smith71> So he just made him a Creepy Crawler oven
<Vordox> How many days have Kevin been time looping? 4 years?
<Deadlypon3> J_e_smith71 even then, where did he get the material so quickly?! And how did he carry it over in loops?!
<[Alpha]> He should use this loops to learn how to draw
<Silver_Spoon> jus-jus-just another day
<Sandvich> I want a monster melt
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<VenHur> ^^
<Dark92Enigma> IS IT OVER YET?
<LadyCanary> I dont know.
<[Alpha]> No
<pony_6548> < and now everyone will love him
<Afflict> You're very reasonable
<DJ_Zypher> ^^^^^^^^^^^
<Afflict> I think we can all agree
<Deadlypon3> TORNADO
<LadyCanary> ....Fhail.
<Vordox> Ded :D
<Tovler> Wasn't there a toy commercial for some kind of toy oven that made gooey monster candy?
<Deadlypon3> Actual kid
<pony_6548> TORNADO POWER
<Silver_Spoon> nononononno
<J_E_Smith71> Deadlypon3: PLOT HOLE, same place where the TNT I guess
<BladedWings> -_(\
<Silver_Spoon> phew
<Sandvich> DR. DREDFUL!
<J_E_Smith71> And ya overdo it
<[Alpha]> D:
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> My great grandpa who passed away a few years ago was the king of debating and arguing.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ew
<Deadlypon3> J_e_smith71 got it from Coyote
<Dark92Enigma> MY REACTION TO THIS FILM <-----------
<Kandarihu> The Monster Melt right on the rug
<Sandvich> DED
<Deadlypon3> ...Now I feel sorry for Todd
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> He was blind, and had one arm, but that didn't stop him.
<DJ_Zypher> SPLAT
<twilight_sprinkle> why isnt he singing
<DJ_Zypher> so jazzy :)
<Bipolarized> Yeah, Todd kinda gets shafted in this movie
<Deadlypon3> ...And todd never appears again
<DerpySenkon> yeah tood whata buzzkill
<Afflict> What a tank
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> He would fish around for something you and him disagreed with and just start a debate.
<pony_6548> ready for smooth jazz?
*LadyCanary yawns.
<Kammerjunk> I'm just glad Todd isn't a stereotypical jackass.
<Dark92Enigma> SOMEONE DROP AN ANVIL ON TODD
<LadyCanary> This woman's voice.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> out of nowhere. it doesnt matter who you were or where you were.
<Tovler> If its a christmas song, there's a jazz version of it, no exceptions.
<Deadlypon3> kammerjunk Instead, he's a incomplete jackass
<Dark92Enigma> SO HIS SUFFERING CAN END :'(
<pony_6548> 99 buckets of fuking ouats
<Dark92Enigma> ANOTHER SONG?
<Vordox> Dark92Enigma: Give Todd a cahance. :P
<Deadlypon3> kammerjunk who doesn't get anything he wants even thought he is justifiablly nice to the family
<Sandvich> MAGIC
<pony_6548> oats*
<normal_brony> not bad
<J_E_Smith71> Oh god original song time
<Sandvich> DAMNIT
<DJ_Zypher> NO BASS!!!!! NOOOOO
<alexxm|colt> white people everyone
<twilight_sprinkle> nah its pretty bad
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Then he would pull out his book and give you a copy and tell you to read it.
<Kandarihu> Kammerjunk, in another timeline, he proposed to a woman IN FRONT OF HER EX-HUSBAND.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> The title was something about dirty liberals.
<Bipolarized> This is like the bad OC of christmas songs.
<pony_6548> and he was studing how to sing for dummies
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: he didnt realize it would hurt him
<Sandvich> Satan pony xD
<DJ_Zypher> not even auto tune can help
<Vordox> Random orchestra
<[Alpha]> it only took a hundre retries
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: after his "suicide attempt" he said he wont propose if it hurts hinm
<[Alpha]> hundred
<Dark92Enigma> Vordox: on second thought.........i'll spare him :( only because i regret it
<pony_6548> AUTO TUNE EVER HELPS!
<Wither> .......
<Tovler> He's a changed diaper… I mean man
<pony_6548> and wubs
<Dark92Enigma> OH, THAT SONG WAS SOOOOOOOOOOO MEMORABLE
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, mom's watching this, and it's hitting a nerve with her.
<Vordox> Dark92Enigma: The thing is, I like this movie, first time seeing it as well
<Deadlypon3> twilight_sprinkle Well, you kinda don't do things if it will actually KILL HIM
<Stormy> hahaha
<PinkieSpice> o-o
<Vordox> Dark92Enigma: But the amount of ingeniuty so far.
<Deadlypon3> Kandarihu a good or bad one?
<Dark92Enigma> REMEMBER, Autotune, always saves the day
<Vordox> Dark92Enigma: It's pretty good.
<PinkieSpice> I missed the movies.... didn't i
<Vordox> OH GOD GRANNY NO
<Silver_Spoon> Granny made this movie
<J_E_Smith71> PinkieSpice: Still one going
<DJ_Zypher> ;)
<DerpySenkon> man todd is right there
<Kammerjunk> Silver_Spoon: This.
<Deadlypon3> ...So is granny knowing about loops
<LadyCanary> Now kiss?
<Bipolarized> Kevin X Granny OTP
<LadyCanary> SO IT CAN END
<Kandarihu> Deadlypon3, a bad one. And I don't think it would be right to keep going on with this.
<DerpySenkon> like he's looking right at you
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: no but it didnt look like he wanted to hurt him at all, plus he didnt even know him before this
<pony_6548> hey you jews shoud kiss '<
<Stormy> wow, going outside with wet hair right now was a terrible idea :(
<Vordox> I wonder...
<Sandvich> SUPRIZE!
<Vordox> What's he going to learn?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esxpEoDENsk&feature=youtu.be
<Dark92Enigma> Vordox: The government needs your testicles
<Deadlypon3> Kandarihu And Todd is never mentioned again
<Deadlypon3> Did he propose?
<Sandvich> Buttsecks
<Deadlypon3> Did he not?
<pony_7413> :|
<Vordox> Dark92Enigma: Hardly, I'm studying Narrative within Game Design, which isn't far from the actual Movie Script Design of Narrative
<Bipolarized> You people and your wishes!
<DerpySenkon> how can you just walk of with your ex for a quiet private moment
<iI11oO0iiiiiiiiiiiii> hi
<Vordox> Dark92Enigma: And so far, I'm enjoying what's it going through

<Kammerjunk> We we we so excited.
<Deadlypon3> ...

<Vordox> <--- Don't tell me...
<Deadlypon3> "Yeah Fuck Todd"
<Kammerjunk> That's basically what Kevin was doing.
<Dark92Enigma> NOOOOOOOO, JUST END THE MOVIE
<Everto> Hey

<BladedWings> And the loop is over...FINALLY

<Vordox> NO
<Vordox> LOOP IS NOT OVER
<Vordox> NOT YET
<Kammerjunk> DerpySenkon: Kevin used the Konami code.
<Dark92Enigma> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Silver_Spoon> Um...Todd?

<Vordox> THAT'S NOT HOW IT SHOULD END?! THEY BROKE THE NARRATIVE RULES
<Wither> I doesnt look like the Satan or :'( http://s1.directupload.net/images/121229/slrdetgf.png
<Tovler> If Kevin had been played by Aisha Tyler instead, then this movie would have been tolerable. 1/10
<BladedWings> Now for the sequal where Todd plans revenge :D
<VenHur> Dark92Enigma: Chill phils! We need chill phils for him here!

<Kimori> I never got a playstation or genesis when I was little
<J_E_Smith71> How is he doing that scrambled text?

<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: The Meta of the Monomyth is the core of a good story
<Lightning_Wing> is pinkie trying to break the fourth wall?
<Silver_Spoon> SaxyPretender: Ah, I had it in my head it was no video links, my bad :x

<Kimori> My parents bought me the console and rented the games for me
<Sandvich> What about the camping?
<Kimori> I was always a gamer :P even as a kid
<DerpySenkon> i think the best part was how consistent his character was
<Deadlypon3> Sandvich well that is REALLY important
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: i dont know what meta of monomyth is.
<Kandarihu> I'm giving it about a 6/10. It might not be great, but I still prefer this over Surviving Christmas. Not sure if everyone here would agree, though.
<Sandvich> YES IT IS!
<CCharmanderK> GOOD GOD, STOP ROLLING THE FUCKING CREDITS ALREADY.
<Deadlypon3> COWBOY ELLIOT?!

<LadyCanary> Calm.
<CCharmanderK> WE GET IT, THE SOUND IS GONE
<Dark92Enigma> THE Enigma's review of Christmas Do Over: WHERE DO I EVEN BEGIN?! This movie sucks, it doesn't know if it's a ripoff or homage to GroundHog's Day or it's predecessor (the clip from the 80's) but it doesn't live up. The characters are terrible. the only one with development is the main one the others just suddenly radically change personality as the plot demands, and it's so mean-spirited. OK, some scenes were funny, but they don't add up at all.
<Ponies47> Everybody stay calm. There is no need to lose it
<Lightning_Wing> thank you dark
<Kencolt> Sound. Atmospheric vibrations that are detected by aural organs.
*Shizuka 13sneaks canary away from dumm complaining ponies

<Silver_Spoon> RD needs to lrn2camp
<LadyCanary> Whoa whoa.
<J_E_Smith71> The rush? It's Black Fri....err Cider Season
<Stormy> my dad's whole family is obsessed with cars though...
<Dark92Enigma> Hi again Shizuka! just in time, i see!
<Graywolf71> just making Fluttershy cuter
<DerpySenkon> her skincolored covers where off
<[Alpha]> :D
<Stormy> must've just skipped me and my brother and sister
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> mariokart 64 looks awesome on modern lcd tvs haha
<CCharmanderK> I think Christmas Do-Over is gonna get blacklisted from being streamed ever again. Just like Epic Movie.
<rdibp> hai
<DerpySenkon> ginitals all exposed
<[Alpha]> I like her ahir like that
<[Alpha]> hair
<SaxyPretender> 0,14nah, it's not WMC
<Bipolarized> Curses, foiled again!
<VenHur> Dark92Enigma: I can make a better movie than that piece 'o shit.
<Lightning_Wing> I feel sorry for poor Rainbow DAsh
<J_E_Smith71> CCharmanderK: We didn't hold a WMC vote so no
<CCharmanderK> WMC?
<LadyCanary> Worst movie clause
<LordDerpington> Worst Movie Clause
<SirGanjalf> CCharmanderK: Really. Well, looks like my bad feelings about this movie were true
<VenHur> Dark92Enigma: It called "The UGLY Barnacle".
<Lil_B> I didn't know that Ponyviille has so many inhabiutants
<[Alpha]> I'm watching this at work :3
<twilight_sprinkle> CCharmanderK: it had a few funny moments, WMC is something too dull and boring to enjoy at all
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I know a bit about cars, not a hobby of mine or anything, but my dad likes cars.
<CCharmanderK> Aaaahh
<J_E_Smith71> CCharmanderK: That's if the movie gets blacklisted
<Sandvich> Just cut the line -_- I do it all the time.
<Dark92Enigma> VenHur: OH, THAT ONE WILL WIN THE OSCAR
*Vordox stands infront of Sandvish, looking angrily and very bruteish
<Vordox> Try
<Dark92Enigma> FRIEEEEEEEEEEEEENDS
<Stormy> If I ever need something to do with cars I just ask a guy
<Sandvich> U mad :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Sandvich: you get a death sentence for that in equestria
<[Alpha]> I'm let people in front of me :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> just dont ask me.
<[Alpha]> I
<Vordox> Lawl I saw Twi and Rarity
<VenHur> Dark92Enigma: Once, there was an UGLY barnacle, he was SO ugly that everyone died! ...The end.
<Stormy> sounds kind of sexist but they almost always know more than me
<Dark92Enigma> ONE MONTH, btw
<Kimori> The music from the Mario Kart 64 game was real awesome
<Stormy> I probably fit that bad driver stereotype perfectly
<CCharmanderK> Thanks to one YouTube Poop I saw which I can't find anymore, everytime Applejack sings "faithful and strong" in the opening, I hear "faithful es shnivel" instead.
<Sandvich> When I was in school I would just walk past all the people and get my food :P
<pony_6548> http://imgur.com/XadSx aww perfect
<Stormy> :(
<Iwa> Venhur: ...That didn't help at all :(

<LadyCanary> Aw.
<CCharmanderK> Poor Dash.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> addagirltothiscar.jpg
<Dark92Enigma> poor RD
<Sandvich> ITS NOT POSIBLE
<J_E_Smith71> [Alpha]: Maybe not enough supply they can't buy it by the barrel?
<Sandvich> WAIT SHE DIDINT GET HER MONEY BACK
<CCharmanderK> Fluttershy doesn't mind because she already got some
<pony_6548> Fluttershy don't mind if RD takes her
<twilight_sprinkle> was pretty loyal of RD to bring along fluttershy and even let her go first
<Vordox> <---- OH SHIT; open Apple Orchard Support line, CALL it!
<Lightning_Wing> I feel so bad for Rainbow Dash. I would so buy Rainbow Dash like FIVE mugs ahead.
<[Alpha]> That might be a possability

<[Alpha]> To be fair only a handful of ponies make the Cider
<Dark92Enigma> Bipolarized: synthetized apple juice
<Kandarihu> You know what? FFB have no right to expect 75% of the profits from the cider. The Apple family worked very hard to grow those apples. And they even use the apples for other purposes.

<J_E_Smith71> Lil_B: Yep

<Barbetos> maybe some one just draws really good
<pony_6548> t1000
<Stormy> Did you temporarily turn into a kid from xbox live yesterday?
<Lightning_Wing> wonder how many bits it costs to rent that hot air ballon
<DerpySenkon> maybe it didn't count when they were in a group
<Vordox> Wow...

<Vordox> REALLY

<LadyCanary> Awwwww piggy :3
<Azuredragon> Here comes Honey Boo Boo
<BladedWings> yea, not fond of this one

<Sandvich> SEXY!!!
<Ponies47> Later guys
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: THIS is the 1st ep TO IGNITE MY RAGE
<LadyCanary> What a cute piggy!
<SirGanjalf> Don't worry, FiW has shown us that he's used to it
<sub06905> bai Ponies47
<Bipolarized> Spike is the biggest clutz in this ep.
<Vordox> Tie: That's the thing I'm confused about...Spike is an awesome sl...buttl.... Err "friend"
<Tovler> Eva Pigford
<alexxm|colt> bye Ponies47
<BladedWings> later Ponies47 ^_^
<Barbetos> Vordox Well if we wanted to look at this from the intended message he is young, really loves his work, or is just really that thick when he is allowed to think for himself
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye Ponies47 ^_^
<Barbetos> He is good at thinking for others.
<DerpyMuffins> Spike is the new Derpy
<Lil_B> nonesense plot, nosthjing for kids really to learn, and generaslly awkward to just watch it, this ep was awful :/
<DerpyMuffins> Bai Ponies47
<J_E_Smith71> Water skiing...over sharks
<Vordox> Barbetos: That's the thing.
<pony_6548> BUUUUUUUUURN
<SirGanjalf> Spike has issues.
<Lightning_Wing> Spike: I JUST CLEANED THAT PIG!
<[Alpha]> :D
<Vordox> Barbetos: Spike has issues
<LadyCanary> PIES.
<Bipolarized> PIES!
<Kencolt> I think it's a dragon thing.
<DerpyMuffins> Dat pie
<Wither> X'D
<Sandvich> PIE!
<Dark92Enigma> Bipolarized: that's the point. he's done some amazing things, and now he's all clumsy
<pony_6548> < gaben

<Dark92Enigma> DAT GILLIGAN CUT.....i feel so old
<Vordox> Lawl Granny...regret that
<Dark92Enigma> WAIT.......PONIES EAT EGGS!????
<Kencolt> Spike is notmally a much betgter cook...
<Sandvich> How did he manage to do that?
<SirGanjalf> When he was falling to his death with Rarity?
<Vordox> Spike has been an able servant forever....
<BroPony|MEDIC> SirGanjalf: Everypony has saved spike
<[Alpha]> :D
<Vordox> Why trouble now?
<twilight_sprinkle> best servant ever
<pony_6548> Ponies eat chickens
<pony_6548> beware scootaloo
<Wither> xD
<sub06905> pinkie eats hotdogs
<J_E_Smith71> Dark92Enigma: Guess it must be for baking purposes
<Lightning_Wing> spike is serioously out of his element
<Tie> Vordox: Exactly. Is he a slave to Twilight or like a brother/son.
<AskPeachy|> scootaloo NUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<LordDerpington> They've always eaten eggs. Eggs are in many baked goods as well.
<twilight_sprinkle> .mov spike
<Sandvich> Wait... CHIKEN LAY EGGS? Jk
<Bipolarized> Makes you wonder how he didn't drop the crystal heart.
<Sandvich> Im not gona fail again.
<Vordox> Tie: I think Spike...either lied about being an assistant...
<DerpySenkon> how did he even find out about the code
<Barbetos> But really, if we take the time to see it for what it is, its just the writer of this episode did not really pay attention to the subtle messages given to the fans from the previous episodes
<thelonecubone|GoW3> twilight_sprinkle: He reminds me of me :P
<Tovler> Man, he would set a whole library on fire
<J_E_Smith71> The code you just made up
<pony_6548> BUUUUUUURN
<Vordox> Tie: And twi doing all the tough stuff.
<twilight_sprinkle> thats the second time in this season he looked like the mov spike
<SirGanjalf> BroPony|MEDIC: Then why he suddenly has an urge to AJ's doormat?
<SirGanjalf> *be
<DerpySenkon> i mean he didn't know anything about dragons before
<Lil_B> ... his behaviour is so unimaginably irrationalll... I mean... this is beyond suspension of disbelieve
<pony_6548> I'LL TASTE HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM
*twilight_sprinkle slaps thelonecubone|GoW3 around a bit with a large cow
<Tie> Vordox: Or he's spy!
<KingMeth> :o
<BroPony|MEDIC> SirGanjalf: It wasnt a good idea for an episode until now
<Vordox> LAWL TWI
<KingMeth> Does anyone here find me sexy?
<Barbetos> Changling spike
<Lightning_Wing> i just wanna make a note of how granny smith seems ALOT less...odd since the reunion.
<Tovler> I only honor Konami Code
<DerpySenkon> i think it all makes sense if there was a way for him to know about the dragon code
<Barbetos> I will go with that.
<Sandvich> How does that book stay up?
<EspyLacopa> lol
<Anger> twi gives 0 fucks
<pony_6548> twi: i don't care of you little annoying dragon
<sub06905> mhmm
<twilight_sprinkle> i cant focus like that
*thelonecubone|GoW3 slaps twilight_sprinkle around with a large chancla :3
<[Alpha]> :D
<EspyLacopa> Twilight is too busy reading to hear Spike.
<DerpyMuffins> 0 fucks given
<SirGanjalf> :):Silly Spike, slaves can't decide who is their master...
<BladedWings> Spike is a changling :D
<J_E_Smith71> "Twilight I'm going to commit a mass murder spree." "Mmm-hmmm, that's fine Spike."
<Afflict> http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/masonry/000/259/943/694.png
<Tie> Every body Haaaate Spike!
<sub06905> dammit spike
<LadyCanary> ....Oh dear.

<twilight_sprinkle> foooreeever
<[Alpha]> he did a mess that fast?
<pony_6548> FOREVER
<pony_6548> :O
<[Alpha]> made
<Lightning_Wing> wow twilight was on full autopilot
<KingMeth> I know you do.
<Lil_B> ... well done Writers... "Why does Twilight not Stop Spike?" , "Well... she's reading and ignored what he said, and nobody questions it..." GENIOUS
<Kandarihu> Tie, Twilight Sparkle personally hatched him from an egg. Even though he's officially her assistant, Twilight Sparkle has more of a mother role to Spike.
<Barbetos> no spike
<Barbetos> go back to twi
<Barbetos> End of story
<Sandvich> YOU NEVER WAS NOBLE.
<pony_6548> < aj so adorable
<Vordox> Kandarihu: So we're seeing Spike for what he really is for once? :P
<pony_6548> and plotty
<EspyLacopa> I wish. . .Spike would stay with Twilight.
<pony_6548> yes!
<Vordox> Lawl AJ. :P
<EspyLacopa> Nice Ax.
<Dark92Enigma> My issue with this ep: Spike has been already saved by :) :( :D and now >_>. WHY SPIKE DIDN'T CALLED FOR THE CODE EARLIER!???? Is this how he got to assist Twi? I'm sorry, this seems rushed and made-up
<DerpyMuffins> Whitewash the fence
<SirGanjalf> Spike, you cheating whorse:|
<Dark92Enigma> THIS WILL END WELL
<[Alpha]> :S
<Lightning_Wing> here comes the glitches
*Lil_B must calm himself.... first thiongs first, mute it
<Barbetos> this part
<LadyCanary> Well that looks delicious.
<Barbetos> I love it
<Sandvich> Shat pie.
<Vordox> We ALL remember when Spike did food last time...
<Stormy> I agree with Afflict
<EspyLacopa> At least it isn't Sweetie's Orange Juice.
<pony_6548> Spike painting a fence
<KingMeth> Kimori does too.
<twilight_sprinkle> rarity, i am dissappoint
<SirGanjalf> Ash Pie, my favourite>_>
<Vordox> Dude...
<J_E_Smith71> Spike must have taken cooking lessons from Sweetie Belle
<Vordox> Too creep
<Sandvich> See the pube on the side of it?
<Kandarihu> Vordox, the real Spike is what we've seen all episode. He was with Twilight all his life.
<KingMeth> I dont think Stormy thinks I am sexy.
<Champion_of_Harmony> creepy....
<EPIC_luna> EAT IT
<twilight_sprinkle> in this upcoming bit that is
<pony_6548> it tastes like shit!
<Stormy> Yes, Kimori probably does agree with Afflict too
<Lightning_Wing> RARITY IS A BLANK FLANK LOOK!!!
<Kandarihu> Er, all series.
<pony_6548> no really it's shit
<Anger> eat it bitch it it good
<Kencolt> Isn't Spike usually a much better cook?
<Alchemist> eat your peas rarity!
<Dark92Enigma> DUH HUH HUH, callback to Spike X Rarity
<Stormy> No I don't
<Kandarihu> ...except for Secret of my Excess.
<Stormy> I'm not into 14 year olds
<DerpDash> Hey Everyone! :)
<[Alpha]> I think I would have preffered Sweetie Belle's Burned jiuce
<Barbetos> Where did spike go anyways?
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Yesh but this is beyond his character.. too far even.
<twilight_sprinkle> now i am dissappoint
<Lightning_Wing> there see she has a blank flank
<Stormy> that would be way creepy
<Tie> inb4 slave
<BroPony|MEDIC> Lightning_Wing: dude, there were full grown blank flanks at the apple family reunion
<Barbetos> Aren't they in the kitchen, with the sink?
<pony_6548> also i thought was good cooking
<KingMeth> lol
<NullRadix> clearly Twi has enchanted him to make him useless when not in her presence
<Bipolarized> Rarity you don't need a debt to get Spike to do that.
<Dark92Enigma> Kencolt the inconsistency in this episode is F*¨**** KILLING ME
<KingMeth> Plus your engaged.
<KingMeth> I am loving Pokemon right now.

<Dark92Enigma> Bipolarized ikr? it's never needed, not when you're talking about Rarity
<Bipolarized> There needs to be a fic of Dashie's novel.
<KingMeth> The NRA is blaming shootings on VGs
<KingMeth> Believe that?
<Sandvich> Hmm
<LadyCanary> Probably is.
<EspyLacopa> Smash through rocks!
<pony_6548> the ROCKS

<SirGanjalf> WAT
<pony_6548> oh i can imagine tonn of sweet sweet art of spikexAJ now
<DJ_Zypher> O,o
<BroPony|MEDIC> Twilight what are you doin
<Vordox> Kencolt: I got to agree on that, but it's taking a huge "Step" of change. :P
<Alchemist> derpiboo.ru/196845
<Stormy> that's good
<KingMeth> :D
<Lil_B> Thats one flimsy excuse for a Plotpoint
<Stormy> I've never seen porn
<Stormy> don't plan to
<Kandarihu> That communication failure between Spike and Twilight Sparkle is stuff I've seen on both sides.
<NullRadix> Maybe we could talk about it... nah, lets take the long way around and trick them into learning their lesson
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I think thats a lie. You have been on the internet too long not to see anything.
<BladedWings> Alchemist: lol
<Lightning_Wing> realy?...counting grass?
<[Alpha]> Now I have a picture of Spike riding Applejack into the sunset stuck in my mind
<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: for some reason that makes me laugh :D
<texasboykc09> counting each blade of grass
<Iwa> I Moustache you a question.
<Stormy> okay I've never _watched_ it
<Vordox> Well...Pinkie has a good idea
<Vordox> No
<EspyLacopa> Moustache!
<BladedWings> dat stache
<SirGanjalf> :D
<KingMeth> oh
<Stormy> I've come across pictures of course
<Graywolf71> Oh Pinkie
<Tovler> not the hornets!
<Vordox> Dat srs face AJ
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> You have never purposely looked for it.
<Stormy> But not intentionally
<SirGanjalf> :3)
<Stormy> yeah
<J_E_Smith71> And anyone could wander in and take stuff from Twilight. "You mind if I take all your bits Twilight?" "Mmmm-hmmm."
<KingMeth> Everyone has never not seen it
<KingMeth> It always pops up
<J_E_Smith71> Pinkie's plan's more fun
<KingMeth> Especially Piratebay
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> OK, I think I can believe that.
<BladedWings> Yes Pinkie, you can wear da stashe
<DerpyMuffins> Dem drawlings
<BladedWings> *stache
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Porn is not thepiratebay
<DerpySenkon> pnikies plan would probably work too
<Barbetos> It must be a dragon thing in the equestrian world. Kind of like second nature. Dragons have a code or something in this case, course Spike does not know the proper code, cause he was never raised by dragons.
<Lightning_Wing> It's-a-me-a-Pinkie pie! :D
<DerpySenkon> better than this shit
<Dark92Enigma> J_E_Smith71: or, Twi would you go out with me? ''hmm-mm''

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> with stuff equal to about victoria's secret models.
<KingMeth> oh
<SirGanjalf> what?
<Kandarihu> Hmm, more animation to Twilight Sparkle's teleport, now. It's like her horn stays in place a split second longer than the rest of her body now.
<Barbetos> Its not that bad. It just gives a massive head ache
<BroPony|MEDIC> Rarity <3
<Barbetos> Cuase it makes you think to damn much
<KingMeth> Everyonce in a while, you get porn on PB
<pony_6548> Alchemist I DON'T GET IT DU'J

<Kandarihu> I see now. They really ARE 3D

<Stormy> I tried to do that last time I was in florida
<Vordox> WHOA
<Vordox> UBER...WOLF!?
<Barbetos> Or to make sure your frands are okay
<[Alpha]> Megawolf
<EspyLacopa> Dire Timberwolf!
<Azuredragon> FORM VOLTRON
<Stormy> but I couldn't get wifi from my room
<Kandarihu> And THIS is why it's okay to kill them.
<Stormy> :(
<CountDoofus> Yeah, didn't notice it until now either
<SirGanjalf> KILL IT WITH FIRE!
<Champion_of_Harmony> Badass timberwolf spotted!
<Buytoast> what
<Bipolarized> Timber Fenrir!
<Wither> Kill she my pet
<Lightning_Wing> I would SO break out my sword and fight that massive pile of twigs myself!!!

<Vordox> Good ...
<Vordox> WHAT THE F*CK!?
<pony_6548> BURN IT WITH FIRE
<Wrek> 05the reason behidn it is probably the advanced animation they had them do (runnign wise) early on
<Tovler> AJ putting on panty hose pose?
<Bipolarized> Lame death is lame.
<texasboykc09> choke it to death
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> One day ill go to hawaii with one of my copters, and set up a live video feed from the copter to the internet and fly around

<Stormy> anyways, uploading those dark pictures of my car now :P
<Vordox> Errrr...
<Champion_of_Harmony> seriously?
<Wrek> 05the biggest paiun ever
<Barbetos> Azuredragon in all those instances she HAD to face them to solve a problem. She is not dumb, knowing when to run or fight is important too.
<Lil_B> and than convinience and tons of Luck strike...
<Dark_Horst> and thus, the new lamest endboss ever
<Tie> dar paiun
<J_E_Smith71> And the Timberwolves end up being easiest to kill villian in the show
<[Alpha]> Eat a rock Explode
<Buytoast> gotta say, that 3d animation made em look too out of place and awkward
<Bipolarized> At the very least they could have used dragon fire!
<DerpyMuffins> Rock beats paper
<Barbetos> Still though, really bad call on her part. She left spike and aj behind.
<pony_1903> way to lie AJ
<Azuredragon> https://derpibooru.org/196712?scope=scpe9f018c09b3497f8a9d5a5042bb43862673f4693e
<Bipolarized> That would've been perfect!
<BladedWings> DerpyMuffins: lol
<Wrek> 05the big one at the end was still flash though
<Kandarihu> Foreign contanimation is the Timber Wolf's weakness... simple brute force works well too.
<KingMeth> Cool
<texasboykc09> brohoof!!
<Sandvich> xD
<Dark_Horst> here's another one for you to think about https://cdn.derpiboo.ru/thumbs/1300/600/2012/12/29/12_47_47_662_196557__UNOPT__safe_twilight_sparkle_spoilers03e09

<BroPony|MEDIC> celestia's letter gauge is very low this season
<Vordox> But the mid and act 3 was decent, (And heck TIMBERWOLVES)

<[Alpha]> Wrek: I can't wait to see the end product.

<DerpySenkon> obviously a Celestia episode
<Rainbow> That looks AWESOME Wrek! :) I just love all that amount of detail what you have put into that Cello. ;)
<[Alpha]> chat derped on me
<Vordox> Wrek: For goodness sake. become an art director for Flash already. :P
<Buytoast> but it will be funny when all these people realize that the Ouya won't be able to play their newer stuff
<DerpySenkon> she has wings and she will flutter them
<Vordox> Buytoast: Play the newer stuff...?
<Barbetos> Vordox not flash. HTML5 is the future!
<Kammerjunk> Ooh, Simon & Garfunkel?
<Barbetos> Flash is poopy
<penguin> well Wrek you got your self a keeper you lucky sonofabitch. yes i is jelly what of it
<Barbetos> always has been and will be.
<Vordox> Buytoast: With support for up to four controllers, its hardware includes a Tegra 3 quad-core processor, 1 GB RAM, 8GB onboard flash storage, HDMI out with up to 1080p support, 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE 4.0, one USB 2.0 port, Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich), and an Ethernet port.
<Rainbow> The name of the song anyyone?
<Sandvich> I wish i could make a perfect circle O.O
<Vordox> There's ONE thing here that looks...crap...>>
<Vordox> 1 Gigabyte Ram? XD
<Lil_B> The things I have pledget on Kickstarter have been, Turrican Soundtrack Anthology, The Pink Album, Descendants of Erdrick Album #2 and Project Giana, they all have paid off so far :)
<LadyCanary> It's something by Simon & Garfunkel.
<Buytoast> four controllers and 1 GB RAM
<Kencolt> Rainbow: The Boxer.
<Buytoast> wow
<sub06905> lel Wrek
<Buytoast> so advanced
<Vordox> Buytoast: Yeah. I got to agree on that part...
<Tovler> I hope their audience is willing to pay more than $10 for a game.
<pony_6548> you can't make a perfect circle by hand
<Rainbow> Thank you Kencolt ! :)
<pony_6548> it's impossibru
<LadyCanary> Wrek, got any other S&G songs?
<Vordox> Tovler: Actually...
<Wither> exists a satan pony because i doesn't want that my Created pony called as a Satan pony ? xD
<Vordox> Tovler: Ouya requires that developers give away at least some gameplay to users for free, although they can profit by offering full-game upgrades, in-game purchases or subscriptions.
<Sandvich> Satan pony -_-
<Buytoast> doesn't matter in the end because people will still eat it up
<Lil_B> yeah... they got so m,uch over their innitial Pledge Goal and still couldn't offer 2 GB RAM... that was... bad
<Buytoast> if everyone is eating shit for dinner, you look the odd one out if you dont want to eat shit
<Buytoast> it's as simple as that
<pony_6548> PONY WANTS HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM
<LadyCanary> Calm.
<Tovler> I forgot about that Ouya detail.
<BroPony|MEDIC> Night everypony
<Tie> night!
<sub06905> night BroPony|MEDIC
<Vordox> Tovler: But then...if you test games before you purchase.. YOu know how many sales loss that is gonna be? :P

<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: and you always fancy yourself as the one person who doesnt eat it?
<Kammerjunk> Is it time to get my groove on?
<Buytoast> subscribe to play the first 1/5 of Final fantasy 3, but make sure you buy the other 4/5ths!
<Vordox> Buytoast: XD
<Rainbow> Funky... Like Scarman or something Wrek? :)
<LadyCanary> I spy Deus eX.
<penguin> i will dance, im not afraid
<Rainbow> Scatman*
<LadyCanary> Me thinks Infected Mushrom.
<[Alpha]> The walking dead has 5 parts
<Buytoast> not the one person
<LadyCanary> Yep, Infected Mushroom.
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, I know this song.
*sub06905 gets funky
<Buytoast> but one of them
<penguin> dat is not funk
<Kammerjunk> I like Infected Mushroom.
*Tovler tries to search for good kickstarter fundraisers.
<Vordox> Also Buytoast: They will be happy to know that in the next few days 1,200 developer versionsof the device will reach buyers who shelled out $699 for the ability to code games for the new Android-based television platform.
<Buytoast> besides, anybody can call anything shit
<Buytoast> so eh
<Rainbow> Lets get this party started. :D
<Vordox> 1200 DEVELOPER versions...
<Tie> No, Wrek. We need smooth jazz. Nao.
<Vordox> That's a pretty good number.
<penguin> ok theres the funk
<Buytoast> it'll still crash and burn
<[Alpha]> We need Yourenigma :3
<Catalan_brony> did i miss the new episode livestream?
<pony_6548> oh, so there is no reasonable stream for now, i'll get the fuck out
<Tie> yup
<Rainbow> Song Wrek? Please! :(
<Rainbow> Name of it i mean.
<Wither> Sandvich why you saying satan pony xD

<Vordox> Buytoast: You do know about a small gravel can make a landslide, right? :P Give stuff time.
<LadyCanary> Jesus...

<Kammerjunk> Rainbow: I Wish by Infected Mushroom
<Kammerjunk> IIRC

<BladedWings> i feel like i have heard this before
<[Alpha]> I like this :)
<LadyCanary> I Wish- Infected Mushroom
<Rainbow> Kammerjunk youre my savior! :)
<BladedWings> oh thanks Kammerjunk and LadyCanary ^_^
<Buytoast> if it wasn't promoted as something that would rival the PS3 in graphical capabilities maybe i would
<Vordox> LadyCanary: How do you know every single Wrek song...?
<Buytoast> but when they're saying stuff like that when it aint true
<Vordox> Buytoast: ...But the fourth gen is about to start
<Buytoast> then i hope it fails
<Sandvich> IT JUST LOOKS SATANIC
<ekips> good evening/morning everyone
<BladedWings> ohai ekips
<Buytoast> and?
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai ekips
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, ekips.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai ekips :)
<Vordox> Buytoast: Gen 3 vs Gen 4...
<Buytoast> it wouldn't be anywhere near what the PS3 would look like
<LadyCanary> Either Wrek and I listen to the same music, or I use Shazam, Vordox.
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Hi ekips :)
<Buytoast> but they keep saying it'll be like that
<Vordox> LadyCanary: Shazam it is
<Buytoast> it's just flat out lying to get sales
<Wither> it doesn't lock satanic D:
<Rainbow> HI ekips
<Vordox> Buytoast: You do know Microsoft started on a lie right? :P
<ekips> so much to read >.>
<pony_6548> i just wonder if we got all of Evil dead movies here?
<LadyCanary> It's both Vordox XD Though I cant say I've listened to much Infected Mushroom.
<pony_6548> sometime
<BladedWings> Wither: why would it?
<Sandvich> Let me see the link again
<LadyCanary> Well, if it wins then probably.
<Buytoast> as far as i know microsoft didn't flat out lie to people to get them to waste money on a subpar product
<CountDoofus> Think I'm gonna get my ass kicked in an online shooter before turning in. Night, everybrony!
<taoumi> o :3 it's drawing w/ wrek time yey~
<Lil_B> unfortunatly, only one other person came :/
<Vordox> Buytoast: ....What?
<Buytoast> maybe use alternate descriptions
<Lil_B> hello ekips :)
<Vordox> Buytoast: Did you just say that.... And being honest?
<Tie> Who wants a Flugel Horn?
<Wither> http://s1.directupload.net/images/121229/slrdetgf.png
<BladedWings> That is some intense detail in the cello Wrek ^_^
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: what did microsoft say
<penguin> thanks guys this music is going into my files. and my files are picky. you people are grade A quality chaps. thank you and see you around
<Rainbow> LOVE IT WREK! <3 Youre SO talented. :3

<Wrek> 05<RainbowDashhh3> I'd like to see things from your point of view, but I can't get my head that far up my ass, wreky boy.
<Sandvich> Well first off...
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Random Merch: Shirts, Cards, Books, and More!
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: but what was the lie
<Tie> BladedWings, Its mine! no.
<Vordox> He needed money, he lied, he got money, he started something.
<MLP_Brovakiin> :D
<Vordox> The exact lie twilight_sprinkle ?
<BladedWings> Tie: but you asked :(
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: "I have a product" <-- He had nothing
<Tie> BladedWings: I LIED!
<Buytoast> they aren't just lying about the product though
<BladedWings> wow Wreky
<DerpyMuffins> Did he really say that to you Wrek?
<Buytoast> they're lying about what it will do
<LadyCanary> What a fucking dick, Wrek.
<Vordox> Buytoast: He was, he didn't even have DOS then
<Sandvich> It has red eyes, Satanic wings, weird ass hord things where its ears should be.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: maybe he meant he had a theory for a product
<LadyCanary> The boy probably needed to make his small dick feel bigger on the internet.
<Rainbow> Yea. :D
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Lol
<LadyCanary> It happens. Also, dis guitar.
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: No...he had nothing
<Buytoast> it's like saying, here, you give me money and i'll make a car if you give me money
<Buytoast> and then i build a go cart
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: He bought DOS from the real developer for about 20k Grand.
<Sandvich> :T
<Buytoast> and tell you its a car
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: That he had no connection to at all beforehand
<Buytoast> it has wheels and a streeing wheel, so it must be a car
<BaconMane> 0,5<LadyCanary> The boy probably needed to make his small dick feel bigger on the internet.
<BaconMane> 0,5LEL
<LadyCanary> ^^"
<Rainbow> I would love to hang out far more but then again its really late around here.... Oh well, im up all night then i guess. :D
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Good luck finding source about this. :P I can't even find it anymore, seems it got deleted.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: im not familiar with the exact quote,but if he said "i have a product" maybe he meant idea for a product
<BladedWings> Rainbow: you never sleep if you come here lol
<Wrek> 05aaaaw
<Wrek> 05the IRCops got to him
<Rainbow> Bladed Wings thts so true! :D
<Wrek> 05and i jsut came up with my response :C
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: No, he had nothing at all, no base, no nothing, he just said he had a product, without having anything to show at all.
<Wrek> 05"<Wrek> I'd make one up but it would be a waste of time, seeing as you are dead determined to try and aggrovate me."
<ekips> no sleep >.>
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm bouncing out for now, peace and enjoy the stream
<LadyCanary> Bye Saxy!
<AdamTheDuck> Bye SaxyPretender
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye SaxyPretender :)
<twilight_sprinkle> bye SaxyPretender
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: DOS was made by another person who he bought from to just show something after the deal was done.
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Bye SaxyPretender :)
<Catalan_brony> i am searching me like hell to find out if i missed the new episode livestream or not... idk what time 10:30 am EST is here...
<Tovler> hm, I should prolly tell my uncle about Kickstarter.
<LadyCanary> You did.
<Catalan_brony> ok...
<BladedWings> Catalan_brony: you missed it sowwy
<LadyCanary> But, you can try YouTube to find the episode.
<BladedWings> ^
<LadyCanary> It's probably up.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: ok, maybe ill look that up
<Rainbow> Wrek, you really need to share your playlist whit me also! You have just AMAZING Music taste! Whats the name of this again? ;)
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Good luck finding it, I'm trying to but haven't found it yet. Searching deeper
<Lil_B> finally, I don't know what just happened
<Lil_B> Vordox searching what?
<Wither> a Question ! is derpy rainbow dashs sister?
<Sandvich> -_-
<Vordox> Lil_B: Searching for the truth of the lie, I remember it clearly, but I don't know from where.
<BladedWings> Wither: no
<Wither> :O
<Lil_B> Vordox which lie? I only followed half of your discussion
<Derpy_Hooves> Wither: LOLWUT, odd thing to get pinged to
<Vordox> Lil_B: Microsoft started on a lie
<BaconMane> 0,5DIE
<pony_6548> yes it is
<Wither> and why love celestia bananas
<pony_6548> as apple, they just bought ideas
<pony_6548> or taking that
<Everto> Why are gold and diamonds worth so much?
<Everto> Not just in one culture, but in all of them
<Graywolf71> So what else is going on tonight?
<Afflict> Cuz they're rare
<BladedWings> Wrek be drawing ^_^
<Afflict> I see what you mean though
<Rainbow> And playing the most amazing music
<Everto> Completely separate cultures, European, Asian, and Native American cultures found them extremely valuable
<Everto> And diamonds and gold are not that rare
<BladedWings> agreed
<Everto> Diamonds are actually incredibly common
<Stormy> high quality ones aren't
<Stormy> they usually have "inclusions" in them and aren't very shiny
<Rainbow> Just really wish i coul also get my hands on his playlist. I really dont know any of these songs.
<Stormy> and are small
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: MS-DOS was a renamed form of 86-DOS – informally known as the Quick-and-Dirty Operating System or Q-DOS[5] – owned by Seattle Computer Products, written by Tim Paterson.[5] Microsoft needed an operating system for the then-new Intel 8086 but it had none available, so it bought 86-DOS for $75,000 and licensed it as its own then released a version of it as MS-DOS 1.0
<Vordox> 75k O.o
<BladedWings> sudden text
<Vordox> DAMN that's alot
<Rainbow> Too mch for me 6_9
<Vordox> That's the best part of what I could find
<AdamTheDuck> Rainbow, most of these are from Infected Mushroom
<Everto> Even still, they aren't rare enough to have thousands of dollars applied to them
<Tie> ITS A PARAGRAPH RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!
*pony_6548 puts on horny helmet
<Wither> to much text X.X
<Rainbow> Ah i see. thanks. :) Helps alot!
<LadyCanary> =_______=
<Everto> Gem cutters can make most diamonds look flawless
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: best I could find,,, from Wiki, but it's not the full truth, hmm
<AdamTheDuck> Rainbow, this one in particular is called "Bust a Move"
<Lil_B> DAMNIT... I just saw that I actually forgot to pledge to The Pink Album to Kickstarter >.< now it's over :/
<Stormy> if you post this on reddit, you'd probably get a huge circlejerk about the evils of the diamond industry
<Everto> And gold is useful in so many things, but they're expensive in jewelry
<Stormy> so we'll just go with that
<Stormy> I guess
<Rainbow> AdamTheDuck i keep that in mind. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: why did they need to do this? were they trying to show an example for some cocmpany to fund them?
<Everto> I'm reading about keyboards
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Bill Gates tried to get IBM sponsorship
<Tie> Wait... did I miss the movie stream?
<LadyCanary> Yep.
<Everto> There's one that uses tiny gold plating switches so that they never corrode
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: hm ok
<Tie> Crap...
<Rainbow> Aye, and so did i if that help a bit.
<Everto> Gold can be pressed down extremely thin. Thinner than aluminum
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: So he got funded on only claim that he had a product, but he hadn't any :P
<Everto> It doesn't corrode, and it is more conductive than even copper
<marauder_shields> so is this a speedpaint or livestream?
<Tie> Well, at least there's an awesome chat room.
<RaveBrony> Wooooah!! Whats the name of this song??
<Sandvich> :O
<Everto> Yet we seem to put it in jewelry for some reason
<AdamTheDuck> RaveBrony, Bust a Move - Infected Mushroom
<Rainbow> Bust a Move id it havent been chnging, its really hard to tell. :D
<RaveBrony> AdamTheDuck: Mmmm, thanks :)
<Vordox> Dis song <3
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: did he use that os he bought or was windows still originally created?
<Tie> We need smooth jazz. I want to just slide out of my chair!
<Stormy> gold is delicate
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Windows was not created back then
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: i know, but i mean after that
<AdamTheDuck> Tie, word of warning, never tell Wrek what music to play.
<Everto> It's malleable and ductile, but not delicate as in breakable
<Stormy> looking at my engagement ring right now, it has tons of scratches and stuff in it
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: And yes, MSDOS was the main computer system back then in the 1970-80s
<RaveBrony> Oi! BaconMane, did you get my email? :o (Sorry for submitting so early too, I didnt realize i had another month :D)
<Tie> O.o
<Everto> Yea
<Stormy> when I first got it one of the diamonds fell out right away
<BaconMane> 0,5Hm, where did you send it?
<Tie> AdamTheDuck Okie Dokie Lokie
<Everto> So why not use something that will keep it's beauty?
<Stormy> and they had to put more gold around them to keep them in
<marauder_shields> where is octavias pupill?
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: i mean did microsoft use the os he bought or was it built from scatch
<RaveBrony> bronystateuploads
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Nah, he used the OS.
<Rainbow> If you mess whit a Brony, make sure you have some sort of escape plan, and a damn good one i mean!
<pony_6548> they used it
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: They needed it for the ...er..8080 I think?
<Stormy> it can easily be fixed if I take it to a jewler to buff it
<Vordox> Intel 8080 or something.
*Tovler resists the urge to brag about his music tastes
<pony_6548> i saw great movie about whole story
<Everto> Something that doesn't scratch easily
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: hm ok, interesting, thx
<Vordox> pony_6548: A movie?
<Stormy> jewelry is not supposed to be treated roughly
<pony_6548> yeh it was
<Vordox> Which one pony_6548 ?
<pony_6548> about apple and microsoft
<Stormy> I guess that's why
<Everto> Something that would better suit jewelry, and use gold for something that it's better suited for
<Rainbow> Whats the name of this one then!? Yes, i a annyin a bit i know. But cant help it! :)
<pony_6548> let me see
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: A movie that may tell it. :D Might also work as reference, if no liberties was taken
<pony_6548> pirates of silicon valley i thought
<Lil_B> reminds me of the Gabe Newell Video... "He also worked on MSWindows Versions for DOS" in the Background we see ... Windows 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2
<Vordox> pony_6548: Gonna take a look at that.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: well i hope its trustworthy sources
<klarinetist> What the crap is this?
<Tie> Dat octi
<Everto> If you print the entire Bible onto gold leaf

<marauder_shields> i think...
<pony_6548> Story about microsoft and apple pretty artistic but also pretty true
<Everto> That's a papercut waiting to happen
<LadyCanary> Scatman?
<Rainbow> What about Him LadyCanary?
<LadyCanary> Nah, just thought what was playing was him is all.

<AdamTheDuck> Rainbow, Swingish - Infected Mushroom , seriously, just look through the albums by Infected Mushroom and you'll find most of Wrek's songs
<Rainbow> I will, ssorry. :)
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: One reviewer: While the movie is long, it would have been even better as a two-day or three-day miniseries. That would have enabled some of the historical record to be explored at greater depth, eliminating the need for this deliberate vast oversimplification.
<AdamTheDuck> Welp, some electroswing
<AdamTheDuck> <3
*BladedWings dances
<LadyCanary> Zip zop zoobeldy bop.

<DynamicB> Silence will fall when the question is asked.
<Tie> ...And then butler got bored of the chat and everypony died. THE END.
<butler> haha. :(
<Tie> ...But little did young butler know, there was evil lurking in the bowels of the chat room that would soon try and corrupt his heart.
<LooF> Come to the dark side butler
<Tie> EVVVIIIILLLL!!!!

<thelonecubone|GoW3> the little Exploding ...^
<butler> boom!
<thelonecubone|GoW3> But they're so cute ^w^
<BladedWings> yea, called Tickers lol
<Kammerjunk> I guess I like Changeling design, but what I love most about Changelings is thinking about them and how they and their society would work.
<BladedWings> weeping_pegasi82: you draw that?
<Kammerjunk> It's so much fun.
<Tie> ...And then butler exploded.
<BigMeth> 7Hey Kja

<butler> indeed is my tagline
<Kammerjunk> Right-o then, lad!
<Kammerjunk> I'd also throw some British slang in, but I'm Danish, so balls to that.
<butler> hah!
<Kammerjunk> Oh wait.
<Kammerjunk> I just realised that "balls to that" is mostly said in the UK.
<Kammerjunk> Dammit.
<butler> thats okay
<BigMeth> that good, huh
<BigMeth> Is there any online pokemons?
<Wither> Who is the best boss in mlp ? ?,.......,?

<Vordox> Or was it Sumica.
<Graywolf71> http://killryde.deviantart.com/art/I-m-In-Your-Dreams-342157444 One, two, Luna's coming for you...
<Wither> the name of the video is '' Two Best Sisters Play a Game'' xD
<Kammerjunk> Oh, Luna can be in my dreams any night.
<Kammerjunk> No, that's not a goddamn innuendo.
<butler> i wish to dream of the mane six
<Vordox> I don't
<Vordox> I would be insane pony
<butler> insane? or brainwashed?
<Vordox> I wonder how many artists died while creating the parts for Applejack as a filly baby
<Vordox> Or did they go the Monthy Python Route
<Kammerjunk> butler: Be awake for at least 20 hours. 1 hour before going to sleep, have a cup of coffee. Right before going to sleep, watch an episode. When lying in your bed, lie on your back with your hands down your side. If something is itching, ignore it. While you fall asleep, mentally describe to yourself the main characters in the show, as well as what you'd like to happen in the dream.
<Vordox> Where one part was made of one artist, so they can't get full view
<Wither> exists sea ponys
<Kammerjunk> Bam. Lucid dream.
<Kammerjunk> Having two dogs, I don't often get to lucid dream, but I do my bloody research.
<Vordox> 20 hours?
<Kammerjunk> At least, yeah.
<Vordox> I'm awake about 24-40 hours in a row...
<butler> i dont drink coffee
<Vordox> Somedays even 3 days
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: Tried some dream recall last night. Result: Never got to sleep. XD
<Vordox> I'm no Lucid :P
<Kammerjunk> butler: Well, get some caffeine.
<Kammerjunk> GilDash: Hah, shame.
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, and the moment you wake up, write down everything you can remember. Helps you in the future.
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: I know. I had times set up for REM cycles and everything.
<Vordox> Is Sumica or Shizuka awake?
<butler> RE?
<Shizuka> 13maybe
<Kammerjunk> Ugh, that reminds me of the Uberman sleeping cycle.
<butler> REM?
<Vordox> Shizuka: Perhaps an idea is to "signature" the images in the stream offline?
<Kammerjunk> I once tried the Uberman cycle in the summer holidays. Ended up very tired when I missed a nap.
<Vordox> Some of them aren't marked with a signature after all
<Graywolf71> Did someone say Monty Python?:P
<Vordox> Graywolf71: Me. :P
<Kammerjunk> Well, it -does- say "OFF AIR".
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: Is that the one where you awake 4 hours, sleep 15 minutes, and repeat or something?
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: Yeah but signature names/Links to the creators of the images.
<Kammerjunk> GilDash: More or less, yeah.
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: Oh.
<Graywolf71> Well then... http://balister.deviantart.com/art/Equestrian-Inquisition-291980762
<Vordox> Dat Rarity peek
<Kammerjunk> Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
<Kammerjunk> Our chief weapon is surprise!
<butler> i do!
<Kammerjunk> Surprise and fear... Fear and surprise...
<butler> or both
<Kammerjunk> Our -two- weapons are fear and surprise! ...And ruthless efficiency...
<butler> that makes 3
<Wither> or the Soul *,.......,*
<butler> oooohhhh!
<Kammerjunk> butler: Our THREE weapons are fear, surprise and ruthless efficiency! And an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope...
<butler> why are u still adding things?
<Kammerjunk> Our FOUR- no...
<butler> spit it all out!
<Kammerjunk> AMONGST our weapons... Amongst our weaponry are such elements as fear, surprise...
<Kammerjunk> I'll come in again.
<butler> k
<superretroworld> why did the hobbit get so many mixed reviews? i thought it was awsome
<butler> me too!
<CriticKitten> superretroworld: It's the high frame rate thing
<CriticKitten> Critics jumped on that as an excuse to bash the film.
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Dammit, that means the file will be bigger.
<butler> i think its because lotr is generally very long
<Everto> Back
<butler> every movie that is
<MadScientIsht> I'm IshBestPony, mo appo fwitta
<Kammerjunk> Okay, I think I got it all down.
<CriticKitten> Kammerjunk: Not necessarily.
<Wither> OMG O,......,o what are you talking about ? at 02:23:18 - 02:23:28
*AdamTheDuck licks MadScientIsht
*MadScientIsht eats AdamTheDuck's fles
<MadScientIsht> *flesh
<AdamTheDuck> D:
<CriticKitten> Most Blu-Ray quality runs at 60 fps, which is above the high-frame-rate of The Hobbit's theatrical release (48 fps)
<butler> haha
<CriticKitten> But it just depends.
<Kammerjunk> Okay, here we go. I think I got it down.
<Kammerjunk> NOBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition!
<butler> k
<MadScientIsht> Kammerjunk I expect an inquisitionof spanish origind
<Kammerjunk> Amongst our weaponry are such diverse elements as: fear, surprise, ruthless efficiency, an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope, and nice red uniforms- Oh damn.
<MadScientIsht> *origins
<CriticKitten> Not that it really matters THAT much. The film critics complained that high frame rate made them motion sick, but that's because they're sissies who are used to 24 fps and tons of motion blur.
<CriticKitten> :P
<butler> nice. thanks a bunch, laddie!
<Wither> ^,.....,^'' ehmm what are you talking about xD ?
<MadScientIsht> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tym0MObFpTI
<DerpyMuffins> I expect the Spanish Inquisition to knock on my door
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: And that's why I have no respect for a whole lot of critics.
<Kammerjunk> I will meet the Spanish Inquisition with nothing but my trusty towel.
<Kammerjunk> A towel has immense phychological value, you know.
<Graywolf71> There is a video on Youtube of the Inquisition scene that uses Trixie
*SpanIshInquIshition knocks on DerpyMuffins windows
<DerpyMuffins> Who's there?
<butler> me i keel you
<SpanIshInquIshition> Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition
<SpanIshInquIshition> !
<CriticKitten> Now one complaint I do admit has some logic to it is that films running at higher fps will need to make sure their props are a lot better in quality, because at a higher fps, eyes will be able to adjust to an object's appearance better and (logically) could probably tell a prop from the real thing more easily.
<CriticKitten> But I didn't see it at higher fps so I don't know if that was actually a problem in the movie.
*SpanIshInquIshition fetches the comfy chair
<DerpyMuffins> Wow, Wrek was streaming into well past midnight
<DerpyMuffins> I feel sorry for the guy
<Kammerjunk> I still think recording at 24 FPS is silly.
<CriticKitten> But my own personal opinion of The Hobbit? It was better than Fellowship, honestly, so if people wanna bitch about how it executes things poorly, I demand they go rewatch Fellowship. >_>
<Graywolf71> :D
<butler> yeah and the audiance could sleep thru it all
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Well, you sound like you know where your towel is.
<butler> doesnt get it
<CriticKitten> The cast is a bit of a problem, but that's more the book's fault for giving us 13 dwarves that aren't all very well differentiated.
<Kammerjunk> butler: Well, you see, towels are important and have immense psychological value.
<butler> thx
<CriticKitten> But otherwise, the film's great, honestly.
<butler> yup...
<CriticKitten> And the folks complaining about it are nutters.
<Kammerjunk> If a strag discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit, et cetera, et cetera.
<CriticKitten> I know this because my parents complained, and my parents are nutters. I REST MY CASE.
<Kammerjunk> Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have "lost".
<Wither> The First Pony on the Moon.....
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: You sounds like quite the froody dude.
<Graywolf71> On second thought let us not got to Canterlot, it is a silly place.
<CriticKitten> Though, I guess I could reasonably understand the complaint about it feeling too long.
