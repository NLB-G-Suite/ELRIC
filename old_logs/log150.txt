<Nittany_Tiger> :<
<Scorchman1337> Sowie Nittany_Tiger =(
*Arentius explains the situation to twilight gesturing wildly
<Scarthceroth> like she'll believe you
<Edward_Newgate> If you played the actual 3 stooges, my nostalgia level would be off the charts
<Lasharus> The Egg Carrier flying off just overhead might be a clue.
<EspyLacopa> Happy happy joy joy!
<Arentius> twilight loves me they all do
<Arentius> I got glomped by them all
<Scarthceroth> she didnt believe pinkie sense though
<Arentius> its proof
<Arentius> yes because she had no proof
<Scarthceroth> and that was because of a magnet
<Arentius> the proof is that lasharus is here and his ship is leaving
<Scarthceroth> doesnt count
<Scorchman1337> who hides their wigs like that xD
<Scarthceroth> but how do we know its lashes?
<Scarthceroth> and how do we know they're on there?
<Arentius> ....GAH *grabs twilight and teleports into the egg carrier*
<Lasharus> Hey now!

<Saturn`> to be honest, i'm not too much of a fan of this
<Scorchman1337> I am loving this xD
<Arentius> should we just...let derpy deal with the muffin bots?
<Scarthceroth> ill get the bread and the patroleum jelly
<Arentius> they seem to be making more muffins
<pony_9530> Though I have to say, the voice of that hippo is incredibly grating.
<Lasharus> What's Twilight doing anyway?
