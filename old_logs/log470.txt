<Reikim> Silverscreen: What happens when you give one of the best anime studios a truckload of crack.
<geeky-brony> lol
<Articuno> ^v^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This sounds like the VA for Ed in FMA:Brotherhood.
<tgl1992> Dem coughdrops
<Articuno> Well I have to go for real soon
<RAWRity> Silverscreen: It's a rather famous mindfuck anime, filled to the brim with strange and confusing imagery, where effectively everything is a massive metaphor for puberty/growing up.
<Silverscreen> 1,11...ah.
<SilverSonic> ^^
<Ingwaz> Reikim: this is what happens when you do that
<SilverSonic> Did you enjoy the honeymoon?
<tgl1992> I knew it sounded like edward...
<RAWRity> Reikim: >Gainax
<cachi01|PS3> guys BRB im taking a bath
<Sumica> 00,10....... I think you are right Nittany_Discord
<RAWRity> >one of the best anime studios
<RAWRity> >what
<sub06905> those eyes
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: How is anything that goes on in that a metaphor for puberty?
<Dan_> lol
<Spectrum_Rush> Nittany_Discord: vic minogana or something
<Reikim> CupcakeWarrior: It's complicated.
<FluttershyLover> dat eye!!!
<Reikim> Spectrum_Rush: Got it.
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: that entire 3rd episode is a metaphor for the menstrual cycle, actually.
<tgl1992> Dat strangle
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: How?
<MahBoi777> lol
<geeky-brony> lol wtf :D
<owlicious> RAWRity: what was that, the cat one?
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: just...watch that ep with that in mind.
<FluttershyLover> :O
<RAWRity> YOu'll see it.
<RAWRity> owlicious: yes
<tgl1992> WHy do I picture naruto though...
<sub06905> lol
<Spectrum_Rush> GET MAD
<Reikim> Um. Okay then.
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: Ive seen that ep three times, I dont see any sort of symbolism
<tgl1992> Dat headbang
<FluttershyLover> :(
<sub06905> wow
<Articuno> Oh it was so awesome :3 today is my last day
<MahBoi777> YEAAAAHHHH RAGE

<FluttershyLover> :S
<Ingwaz> i love this show
<Rain> mips! Stop sucking so hard!
<Derpy_Hooves> :3
<CupcakeWarrior> Why do people like this so much? Its just random things that make no sense
<Spectrum_Rush> CupcakeWarrior: exactly
<MahBoi777> random things are best things
<Articuno> I am going to design a website that'll hold all our wedding and honeymoon pics.
<Rain> because what fun is there in making sense?
<Ingwaz> CupcakeWarrior: it makes sense if you pay attention a bit, and its basically like pinkie pie, its hilarious even if it is random as crap
<Articuno> That way I'll have nice online albums as well as real ones
<SilverSonic> awesome! :D
<RAWRity> Lots of people make the mistake of thinking FLCL is "random" or weird for the sake of weird. Not true. It's more "Hey, we've got a rather simple coming of age story to tell. Let's doing it in the most hyperactive, strange way we can, and let the animators run wild!"
<tgl1992> If everything would make sense, Pinkie Pie wouldnt make sense
<geeky-brony> agred MahBoi777

<geeky-brony> huzzah
<Kencolt> KaitoThePony: I have a very different theory. Derpy and Ditzy are identical twins. Ditzy is married, happily, and makes soda pop for a living. Thus the bubbles. She has no sense of direction, though... Derpy OTOH has a perfect sense of direction which is why she works as a mailmare. Those ain't bubbles on her flank. those are map co-ordinates.

<drfsupercenter> 03I have everything else done
<Ascendant> well
<drfsupercenter> 03:|
<slendermane2> lol
<Ascendant> what are you currently using for the recursion?
<drfsupercenter> 03I haven't written it LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03but my teacher said it should only be 4 lines
<Ascendant> ._.
<drfsupercenter> 03I have like

<Ascendant> some stuff to prevent the coordinates from going into negatives
<LadyCanary|wubwub> Found em
<Kencolt> Saturn: Usually eaten either at breakfast, often with a suasage gravy or a sausage patty, or ham. At any time with fried chicken. UNless the fried chicken is served with waffles.

<RAWRity> Luna_of_War: that was the Girl Power episode.

<MahBoi777> so jelly
<Saturn> 08,01with jam in it
<RAWRity> Saturn: ah.
<Kencolt> Most often with Peanut Butter. I doubt there is a SINGLE american , native born, who didn't grow up with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> lol
<RAWRity> always wondered about that.
<FlareChaser> Hey Shamroc where do you live again? America?

<RyunosukeKnT> sokka x princess shipping
<Sumica> 00,10you would think waterbending would be kinda dull entertainment to a nation of waterbenders

<Spectrum_Rush> uh...
<Saturn> 08,01and why
<CupcakeWarrior> I would have to say Twilight
<Kencolt> The scary thing about this show is that Dan is usually got it right.
<Everlasting_Joy> 1-1-1-6-0-4
<Sylandest> Saturn: Twilight and AJ
<RAWRity> Saturn: hmm...I guess the one I identify with the most is Applejack.

<Sylandest> Sumica: I second that
<RyunosukeKnT> lol
<RAWRity> Mostly because she's very much the same as me in terms of the role we play with our friends.
<MahBoi777> lol
<Pinkies4thWall> Saturn: Twilight
<Ingwaz> Saturn: what do you mean by identify with though? care to clarify to be sure?
<Saturn> 08,01Ingwaz: would you saw you identify wiht them the most emotionally?
<Spectrum_Rush> Saturn: would you believe the entire mane 6
<FlareChaser> Saturn: Hmm...Probably Twilight Sparkle and Pinkie Pie, I can be intelligent but hyper, I love to read, but hate math.
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: Are you still writing the meanwhile fic?
<RAWRity> I'm the most consistent and straightforward, and probably the most likely to be called "boring"
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: yes.
<Kencolt> And the split toe sock is called a tabi. FYI.
<apple> lol
<Sumica> 00,10cookie ninja
<Saturn> 08,01interesting
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Saturn: I would say I'm most like Pinkie, cause I'm over energetic and I like a good laugh
<FlareChaser> RAWRity: I want it to be done!! D: :P
<Ingwaz> Saturn: emotionally as in say their problems or things like that?
<Ascendant> heya Aurora

<Twi_Fi> Oh Hello SuperBrony64

<HyperMetalLugia> Congrats?
*Pinkies4thWall gives SuperBrony64 cookies
<CupcakeWarrior> SuperBrony64: Guess what?
<HyperMetalLugia> Hardware failure?
<Ingwaz> Saturn: well... i cant say i identify with any one in particular the most. i identify on some levels with all of the mane6 for the most part on some level. However, i do love a good laugh so I enjoy pinkie pie the most by far
<Saturn> 08,01do you think that to be a fan of the show, you need to have had problems or insecurities that allow you to identify with one of the main characters?
<Kencolt> THis is historical fact, actually, Except for the cookie part. Japan never had cookies-- or biscuits-- until the advent of the Wast,
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Saturn: Actually I'm more of a mix between several Ponies, I'm loyal like Rainbow, energetic like Pinkie, Kind like Fluttershy and Bipolar like Rarity

<Kid_Cobalt> Saturn: Fluttershy honestly, I front that im hard boiled the whole "I dont care about anyone solo act" But in truth im extremely shy I choose to stay to myself not because I just enjoy my solitude. But because I'm too shy to speak my mind. And I enjoy animals because for the most oart there love is unconditional. And they don't care who you are or what you've done.
<MakerDusk> lol
<Ingwaz> Saturn: of course not. I didnt become a brony because i had crap happen to me previously. I became a fan because its an awesome show
<FlareChaser> Kid_Cobalt: calm down bro, simple explanation.
<MakerDusk> "ninjitsu"
<Shizuka> 13uhhhhh internet?
<RyunosukeKnT> internet?
<Sylandest> Saturn: not necessarily, but it helps to relate to a character and feel a connection. If you have a connection, big or small, you enjoy the character's presence more
<RAWRity> Saturn: no. I'd say it might help you enjoy the show, but it's certainly not a requirement.
<Dken2021> Saturn pfft, nah, it's fun hnaging with fans
<MakerDusk> laughed so hard
<Glacymr> lol
<Twi_Fi> Calm down FlareChaser
<DAT_FLANK> Saturn: not really, but I find myself doing that with every show
<Kid_Cobalt> FlareChaser: It is simple! in a non-simple way :3
<Spectrum_Rush> Saturn: adorkable and neurotic like twi, shy like flutters, always try to make friends smile like pinkie, honest like Aj, loyal yet slightly brash like RD, dgenrous and drama like rarity
<geeky-brony> ninjato
<FlareChaser> Kid_Cobalt: TL;DR.
<RyunosukeKnT> lol
<Saturn> 08,01Ingwaz: but do you think it's an awesome show because you can identify with the characters, and if so, does that relate to problems you've previously had in life?
<Petrified_Discord> Just because I don't have a problem personally doesn't mean I can't empathize with a character that does :)
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> ^
<LadyCanary|wubwub> Oh sheet xD
<Saturn> 08,01interesting responses so far
<RyunosukeKnT> thats... kinda the plan
<FlareChaser> wat
<Rain> exactly
*SuperBrony64 picks up DeathStar and gives her a big hug while looking over at CupcakeWarrior, "What? :3"
<RyunosukeKnT> lol
<Shizuka> 13elise is jim
<Sumica> 00,10I like the show cause it made me laugh
<Dken2021> ohai SuperBrony64!
<Ingwaz> Saturn: hmm...i didnt really know enough about the show at the time to identify that deeply with the characters. however, if we're talking which character we feel the biggest connection to, such as something like a big friendship connection, its pinkie pie
<Petrified_Discord> Oh, and I never answered the first part. Discord. 'Cus making sense is dumb.
*SuperBrony64 looks over at DeathStar "Also, Hai :3"
<Kid_Cobalt> Saturn: I find it comforting that there are others who are like me "bronys" It makes me feel less alone. If that makes sense.
<FlareChaser> She had a derp face.

<MakerDusk> that's why I do my own baking
<RyunosukeKnT> that crack
<Ingwaz> Saturn: i'm weird like that. I'm fairly quiet, calm, collected, yet i love to laugh. so I think i feel the strongest emotional connection with pinkie pie
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat LadyCanary|wubwub with all her wubwubs :3
<Saturn> 08,01it has the vulgarity of violence

<twilight_sprinkler> Saturn: yeah, i know, but its withing decent limits at least. the one thing i didnt like was the spiked drink joke
<Saturn> 08,01but that's off topic

<Kencolt> Wait-- THIS TIME OF YEAR?
<Ingwaz> flying monkeys? this time of year?
<Saturn> 08,01because i've had similar problems, being the lone nerd with no friends
<Spectrum_Rush> them kids dont giv a fuc
<Saturn> 08,01and i value friendships, a lot
<RAWRity> Saturn: I identify with AJ, but Rarity's my fav.
*LadyCanary|wubwub can fly
<HyperMetalLugia> You know what I find really sad about this mint install? The fact that my year old bloated win7 oem install was able to keep all the programs I wanted running without crashing or freezing :|
<RyunosukeKnT> lol dan
<Rain> but, Saturn, she didnt /want/ friends
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I also identify with Twilight.
<FlareChaser> Applejack is best background pony.
<Sumica> 00,10and LA trafic gave no fucks
<HyperMetalLugia> and I actually had an uptime that was reasonable for a laptop :D
<Ingwaz> Saturn: emotionally i still feel i identify strongest with pinkie pie. our personalities are very different actually but i just find her to be very appealing. as the expression goes, opposites attract
<FlareChaser> Nah, Octavia is :3
<Saturn> 08,01there was a point in my life, when i just started uni, where i'd never really had any real friendships before, and suddenly started making friends
<Petrified_Discord> Oi. Use a GUN.
<Sylandest> Saturn: I'm the same way, hehe :$
<CupcakeWarrior> Saturn: That was me before high school
<RyunosukeKnT> this show needs more jack :)
<Pinkies4thWall> Saturn: that is exactly why i identify with twi as well
<RyunosukeKnT> wow
<LadyCanary|wubwub> I mostly identify with Fluttershy. And a bit of Rarity as well.
<Kencolt> Captain America with a bad temper.
<GeeGeePony> lol
<FlareChaser> Who said Dan wasn't a Ninja?
<MakerDusk> Saturn: we're all like that
<Glacymr> do ipod emulators exist?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> lol wut
<SparklyWaffles> *pokes Saturn*
<CupcakeWarrior> The nonja is nittany
<Dken2021> dat explosion
<CupcakeWarrior> ninja*
<Rain> lol
<FlareChaser> Am I high....?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> pffft
<MakerDusk> that's why we're all here >_<
<SparklyWaffles> xD
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> hahahaha
<LadyCanary|wubwub> @-@
<Spectrum_Rush> bitch be tripping balls :O
<HyperMetalLugia> uh wat.
<Ingwaz> i need to make more non internet friends...i like my internet friends, but non internet friends are different in their own way
<Saturn> 08,01and that's my theory about bronies really; our strong connections are forged by not only the message of the show, but an introspection that we share in acknowledging it as something we want to identify with
<HyperMetalLugia> Define it
<Rain> Bad trip, man! Bad trip!
<HyperMetalLugia> emulators *on* an ipod?

<HyperMetalLugia> Or emulators that emulate ios
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Glacymr> something that can allow you to use ipod apps on your PC
*Spectrum_Rush Saturn claps
<Ingwaz> Saturn: as something that helps make us better basically?
<Sylandest> Saturn: very insightful! :)
<Saturn> 08,01Ingwaz: not even that, just as a commonality
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't think so
<geeky-brony> ok
<GeeGeePony> :D
<FlareChaser|Octavia> Lol :3
<geeky-brony> :D
<Everlasting_Joy> Saturn: I don't think a connection is necessary, but it helps immensly to enjoy the show.
<RyunosukeKnT> whump
<FlareChaser|Octavia> Close Enough
<Ingwaz> Saturn: oh, so you mean basically you know..we all have this in common, lets be friends? except on a very wide scale considering our community
<RAWRity> Yeah, being interested because you identify with something in th show doesn't really make you "better".
<VioletGreySha> FlareChaser|Octavia: check your notes
<Petrified_Discord> At the end of the day the undeniable fact is that the show is just good. Really good. And good HAS no demographic. :)
<Saturn> 08,01john de lancie generalised this even more when i was tlaking to him about it the other day, saying that this need to be together, to identify and to introspect, comes from the bad things that happen in our lives; that is a common underlying cause. i'm not sure how much i agree with that, but it was certainly interesting to hear
<FlareChaser|Octavia> VioletGreySha: ...Okay.... >.>
<RyunosukeKnT> wait, what Saturn
<CupcakeWarrior> Saturn: Will you be in the documentary?
<Pinkies4thWall> YOU TALKED WITH Q?
<HyperMetalLugia> Glacymr
<Saturn> 08,01CupcakeWarrior: i don't really want to be
<Petrified_Discord> Wait...you were talking with wait WHAT? :O
<HyperMetalLugia> Switch to Android already.
<Sylandest> Saturn: it makes sense to me. I can find something to relate with in every character of the mane 6
<twilight_sprinkler> Saturn: a lot of people watch the show to get away from real life
<HyperMetalLugia> there are android emulators for PC
*Spectrum_Rush com on down to BronyState, where we dicuss the psychological nature of why we are here together.
<Ingwaz> Saturn: the bad things in our lives can certainly bring us together. why were you talking to john de lancie btw?
<HyperMetalLugia> and even virtual machines of android ;D
<hen3ry> suddenly fanboy pandamonium
<RAWRity> Petrified_Discord: of course. Saturn is organizing BUCK, and De Lancie is set to be a guest there.
<Saturn> 08,01Ingwaz: con stuff; can't talk aobut it too much at the moment
<Glacymr> i don't know if there is an ascension app for android
<RAWRity> makes sense they'd communicate
<FlareChaser|Octavia> D:
<Sumica> 00,10You all seem to forget Saturn is working with BUCK
<Ingwaz> twilight_sprinkler: wanting to escape is normal. but thats generally not the only reason
<Saturn> 08,01RAWRity: he's not set to be a guest there yet; we're still under negotiations
*Petrified_Discord doesn't know what BUCK is... :/
<Saturn> 08,01Brony UK Convention
<Ingwaz> Saturn: a guest at bronycon?
<apple> deep coch
<RAWRity> Petrified_Discord: British Brony convention
<Dken2021> Petrified_Discord a con in eurpoe
<Ingwaz> oh, the uk one
<Spectrum_Rush> Petrified_Discord: you dont know wat the buck BUCK is?
<FlareChaser|Octavia> ...umm...
<FlareChaser|Octavia> :|
<Petrified_Discord> Thanks everypony :)
<Sylandest> FlareChaser|Octavia: yesh?
<LadyCanary|wubwub> He crazy
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> lol
<RyunosukeKnT> woah
<FlareChaser|Octavia> Sylandest: what?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm sorry if i come off as being all boasty talking about JdL, but it's just that a lot of my life this last week or so has revolved around him and the bronycon documentary, so it's what's been on my mind the most
<RyunosukeKnT> panicked
<RAWRity> >poison
<HyperMetalLugia> they should just port it to gingerbread and everybody will be happy
<Dken2021> lol
<HyperMetalLugia> sorta
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> poisoned and dead
<Sylandest> FlareChaser|Octavia: I thought you had a question or something :$
<RAWRity> >Defibrliator
<FlareChaser|Octavia> Sylandest: nope! :P
<CupcakeWarrior> I wish I had money to go to cons
<Petrified_Discord> It's true. He didn't say he was sorry.
<Shizuka> 13RAWRity: works for the infected!
<Sylandest> FlareChaser|Octavia: hehe :D
<Spectrum_Rush> Saturn: is ok silly
<Dken2021> tis ok Saturn, do what you need to do
<Saturn> 08,01hence, why i'm so freakin' stressed

<CupcakeWarrior> FlareChaser|Octavia: You two are so cute together
<RyunosukeKnT> lol
<Ingwaz> Saturn: anyway, as i was saying. the bad things in our lives can bring us together. Used to be i considered something in my life to be a curse. I've since learned more and now i consider it to be a gift, even if it can be painful at times
<Shizuka> 13you look like you're missing a health point....

<RainBowJack> bye bye everypony
<FlareChaser|Octavia> Shamroc: :'(
<Saturn> 08,01y'know, until someone just mentioned me being in the docu just now, i'd never even considered that i might be, except in the background doing BUCK stuff while he's filming the con. i've more been concerned with actually getting him here rather than whether he'll want my opinion on anything
<CupcakeWarrior> FINISH HIM
<LadyCanary|wubwub> FINISH HIM.
<LadyCanary|wubwub> Dammit D:

<Shamroc> Shizuka: darnit...was trying to be smart
<Ingwaz> Saturn: planning a separate doc for the uk convention or the same one?
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i have no idea what will happen; best not to speculate
*Shizuka 13's head spins

<Ingwaz> Saturn: cant even talk about whether or not its possibly for a second doc?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> pfft
<CupcakeWarrior> Saturn: Why dont you want to be on camera?
<Saturn> 08,01Ingwaz: well, it'll be part of the current doc
<CupcakeWarrior> Hai Saxy

<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Mine!
<Shamroc> but really Shizuka i can NEVER prevent you from healing me...
<Saturn> 08,01CupcakeWarrior: i'm not... shy, exactly. i just second guess myself a lot. i don't have faith that i won't fuck thigns up, and i don't have a good opinion of my own abilities or material i produce.

<Ingwaz> Saturn: well, thats not necessarily what theyre looking for though. if we wanted philosophical debate, we'd go to somepony who knew nothing about us. i'm sure if you tell them you arent comfortable on camera they'll oblige if thats what you really want
<Saturn> 08,01Iron_Edge: i cover mine with humour and innuendo. tends to work well, unless i go too far with the sleezyness
<FlareChaser|Octavia> NOO!

<RAWRity> Saturn: I dunno. Everybody has their own take on the community, and considering how much research and work you've put into both BUCK and Bronystate, I'd consider you a very good choice to ask about Bronydom.

<Giger4444> it was also Carl Sagan who said that if we ever meet with an alien life form, we may not establish communication.
<Om> If we find a growing planet with life, I vote we make ponies the domanant life form
<Spectrum_Rush> he old
<derpy_pony> we will compete for resources. communication doesn't make sense
<Giger4444> Because that life form would either be too advanced or too backwards compared to us, but it wont be on par technologically.

<Chrysalis> G'night TGAPT
<VioletGreySha> night TheGreatAndPowerfulT :3
<Ghosties> 04Is there a game richer than Metal Gear Solid 4? I don't believe so
<VioletGreySha> never played it
<Ghosties> 04Hmm, perhaps 'richer' is the wrong term
<Ghosties> 04Ah
<Ghosties> 04'Finer'
<LightTrooper105> lol
<Spell-of-Gaming> I thought you mean price.
<Ghosties> 04Oh, and good morning Chrysalis
<Chrysalis> good morning Ghosties
<Spell-of-Gaming> There's an eBay auction for EarthBound that's like... 1,000 dollars.
<VioletGreySha> console games... boring PC ftw ^3^
<Ghosties> 04$1,000 for Earthbound?
<Ghosties> 04Sounds about right
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Spell-of-Gaming> EarthBound is pretty rare
<Ghosties> 04It's that good of a title
<Ghosties> 04And it's incredibly rare
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's almost as rare as Nintendo Championchip League, if that's the name.
<Ghosties> 04So couple its cult pheonemon status with excellent gameplay and rarity and you have quite an expensive title
<Spell-of-Gaming> I love how they put out all the religious things on the original Mother, when they have religious games like "Noah's Ark" on the NES. :P
<Ghosties> 04You gotta love it :P
<Kandarihu> Um, it's a lot more complicated than that.
<Ghosties> 04Then please
<Ghosties> 04Teach us
<Ghosties> 04Kandarihu
*Ghosties takes a seat
*Ghosties listens
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Chrysalis> oh wow derpy toy is legit
<Spell-of-Gaming> Well, in the translation, anyway.
<Chrysalis> sometimes we get to wake up to the greatest of news :D
<Ghosties> 04The eyes better be derped up
<Chrysalis> yup
<Kandarihu> The Wisdom Tree games are unlicensed. Nintendo doesn't grant the seal of quality to 3rd party games to anything that has ANY Christian imagery in it, much less allows it in NA versions of their own games.
<Chrysalis> http://content.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2012/05/exclusive-preview-the-2012-special-edition-my-little-pony/1#.T8c6hlw53Sz
<Dark_Horst> the derpy toy? why yes, it is a derpy
<Dark_Horst> i'm still amazed
<Ghosties> 04Huh, never knew
<Spell-of-Gaming> Kandarihu: There's an actual "Nitendo's Seal of Approval" Noah's Ark game. And guess what?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Konami made it. :P
<Kandarihu> I'm going to look it up on Gamefaqs right now.
<Ghosties> 04They even have muffins on the box
<Ghosties> 04Sweet baby Jesus
<Chrysalis> it is awesome isnt it
<Ghosties> 04Very much so
<Ghosties> 04Although
<Ghosties> 04It looks like pre-G4 Derpy
<Spell-of-Gaming> AVGN's review of Mario 3 is pretty weird as hell.
<Spell-of-Gaming> There's a Robot Jesus with machine guns. I was like "what the hell"
<Dark_Horst> well, it's the standart mold they keep using for that size
<Kandarihu> I see. The only Noah's Ark game I knew of was the SNES game with the Wolfenstein engine.
<TheRainbowDash> Oh, hello everypony.:)
<Spell-of-Gaming> ohai TheRainbowDash
<Ghosties> 04Looks like Kandarihu and myself both learned something today
<Kandarihu> You know what? The only reason I even HAVE an NES is because of Wisdom Tree. And I had to send that NES to them just to have it modded to play their games.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Kandarihu: That's awesome. So did they do it?
<Kandarihu> Yup
<VioletGreySha> hay TheRainbowDash
<LightTrooper105> TheRainbowDash hallo
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> any1 here watch blue xephos?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I do. :P
<TheRainbowDash> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I do, but not really anymore.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> TheRainbowDash: they made a minecraft version of Hunger Games
<LightTrooper105> Alicorn_Prince_Shane same with TheRainbowDash
<TheRainbowDash> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Ah, I've seen that. Pretty cool mod indeed.
<Kandarihu> To be fair to Nintendo, some of Wisdom Tree's games, the platformers in particular were pretty bad. But the games that were based on other games were alright.
<Kandarihu> The last of their NES games, Bible Buffet had a big thick booklet with questions and answers. At points in the game, players were presented with the NUMBERS of the questions and prompted to answer the questions according to what's in the booklet.
<Chrysalis> huh, have i dcd or is it just quiet
<TheRainbowDash> Chrysalis: Yeah, just quiet.:D
<Chrysalis> wow
<Kandarihu> I understand that having all that text in the game would've made the rom impossibly huge and required them to render text in ways their programmers just couldn't handle.
<TheRainbowDash> Wait, hello.....?:D
<Dark_Horst> hey guys, check this out http://9gag.com/gag/4322435
<TheRainbowDash> Dark_Horst: Wait, detonate any explosive device that is on you? Wow...that is dangerous.
<pony_6779> man wonder who has to clean up all the bits after
<Dark_Horst> no... really?
<TheRainbowDash> I think so Dark_Horst....
<Dark_Horst> stepping into a plane with explosive devices suddenly doesnt sound like such a fun idea anymore now does it?
<Twi_Fi> Hello TheRainbowDash
<TheRainbowDash> Yeah, now you just a dead pony.
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Twi_Fi.
<Ghosties> 04Dead pony?
<TheRainbowDash> Mhm Ghost.
<Ghosties> 04Does that mean they'd become ghosts?
<TheRainbowDash> No, no, no, no...:D
<Ghosties> 04Well that sucks
<TheRainbowDash> Too bad then.
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Ghosties> 04So then, what happens to them
<TheRainbowDash> They just die, that's all.
<LightTrooper105> so just darkness?"
<Ghosties> 04That's not too bad
<TheRainbowDash> Yeah, it isn't, I have to admit.
<LightTrooper105> ok..
<TheRainbowDash> LightTrooper105: It is super quiet in here.:P
<LightTrooper105> i know
<TheRainbowDash> I can even hear my crickets chirping.
*LightTrooper105 sips apple tea

<Ghosties> 04<XAX> Ghosties: Remember me telling you about MTA? do you think there could ever be a bronystate MTA event? Servers on that game can hold hundreds of people, and it's heaps of fun. <-- MTA?
<XAX> TheRainbowDash: Never mind, lol. Glad you had fun
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: university and organising a convention
<TheRainbowDash> XAX: Ah, I did.:D
<Kandarihu> d3rb: it's always lurkfest. Even when there are lots of people chatting.
<Vordox> Saturn: D:
<XAX> Ghosties: MTA. multi theft auto. A mod that allows you to play GTA San Andreas online with others.
<RoboGerbil> say MTA some more.. not sure what it is :P
<Ghosties> 04Ohhhhh that
<d3rb> very true Kandarihu
<Ghosties> 04I dunno, not sure how many people on BronyState would be interested in something like that
<Ghosties> 04Espcially since it's technically an older game
<Vordox> I'd rather do fun stuff Xax. that doesn't involve killing, theft and immoral gameplay moments. :(
<d3rb> gta is awesome though
<XAX> D:
<Dark_Horst> what's an MTA?
<XAX> ^lol
<d3rb> multi theft auto, mulitplayer mod for gta, not sure whic one though
<Ghosties> 04GTA is awesome, but it's San Andreas
<Ghosties> 04Which came out in mid-'00's
<Ghosties> 04Actually, more like early 2000's
<Kandarihu> All the more playable, then.
<d3rb> it was closer to mid
<Dark_Horst> sounds fun. i think i have my old gta's lieng around here somewhere
<XAX> Ghosties: Which means it's cheap, which means most could buy it for an event :D
<Ghosties> 042004
<Ghosties> 04So mid 2000's
<Vordox> <.<
<Vordox> >.> Create a chat social pony game...Hur hur hur... Oh wait, need PHP connection derp
<d3rb> pony based mmorpg
<d3rb> thats where the money is
<Ghosties> 04It's not about how cheap it is, XAX
<Ghosties> 04It's about if people would enjoy it
<XAX> I suppose
<Kandarihu> I wonder if it's possible to have a quadroped character on Second Life.
<Ghosties> 04It's a bit different from GTA IV
*XAX has never played a GTA game newer than SA
<XAX> wat
<d3rb> should get 4 XAX its pretty good
<ehm> There's not much to do in MTA. Basically a deathmatch.
<Ghosties> 04GTA IV is more "realistic"
*Kandarihu has never really played any GTA game, but isn't really opposed to it.
<Ghosties> 04But I think the Carmageddon mod for GTA IV is fucking awesome
<TheRainbowDash> ....oh, got to go everypony.
<XAX> ehm: There's a server called CIT. it's a RPG server.
<Ghosties> 04Truly a grand old time
<XAX> TheRainbowDash: :( Bye bye
<d3rb> carmageddon mod.......WHY DO I ONLY JUST KNOW ABOUT THIS
<TheRainbowDash> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/28474/Call-for-Action-- And if you haven't heard, I already started a 3rd story.
<Ghosties> 04Or is it "grand ole time"
<Spell-of-Gaming> GTA SA was pretty much the most played in internet cafes in my country years ago.
<TheRainbowDash> Hope that you enjoy it!:)
<d3rb> bye TheRainbowDash
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> dam it cachi isnt on
<Vordox> Ghosties: PRefer the original GTA myself. :P
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> bai TheRainbowDash
<Ghosties> 04Oh god, the original GTA?
<Ghosties> 04As in the top down GTA?
<d3rb> gta 1 and 2 are good games
<ehm> Vordox: best soundtrack, hands down
<Ghosties> 04Ugh
<Ghosties> 04I just couldn't get into them
<Vordox> ehm: Eyup, original wise.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ^^
<Vordox> The only one that comes CLOSE to that BGM is...
<d3rb> so many hours wasted on gta2
<Ghosties> 04Funny enough though I want Retro City Rampage
<Ghosties> 04Which looks just like the original GTA games
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4JvKl7nvL0 <--- The only song that ACTUALLY was good, and it lastedd for seconds ONLY, urgh
<d3rb> what no way
<Spell-of-Gaming> The people at Pokememes call the Pokemon fans who prefer the older generations "genwunners"
<d3rb> justice-waters of nazareth
<Ghosties> 04Okay, so, do you mean, like, best original GTA IV song or best GTA IV song period including radio songs?
<Vordox> That rhythm, bass, tunes....<3
<d3rb> it was on electro choc
<Vordox> Such awesome song
<Vordox> Exluding Radio songs, of course.
<Ghosties> 04Ah, good
<Vordox> Otherwise it would be no chance. D:
<Ghosties> 04Because I was really going to beg to differ
<Vordox> Originals are what counts, as that shows what the maker of the games can do
<Vordox> And not rely on outer factures.
<Vordox> factions
<d3rb> ah ok
<Vordox> factors...derp
<Vordox> But this loading song....<3 LOVE IT
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ghosties: u heard the TBOGT theme song?
<Ghosties> 04I don't know what that is
<d3rb> the ballad of gay tony expansion
<Ghosties> 04Ohhhhh
<Ghosties> 04No, I haven't
<Ghosties> 04But I have played the DLC
<d3rb> thats an eric prydz song
<Vordox> I AM going to revolutionise the gaming industry with Memory Gaming within action platform, I DECREE IT! huzzah! and stuff
<Spell-of-Gaming> I have to say, my favorite RPG is Earthbound. It somehow introduced insta-battles where you can instantly kill lower-level enemies, which makes it less annoying. :P
<Monfang> Hey ya'll
<XAX> Vordox: Goos luck :o
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ghosties: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu1bTFLlaY

<Vordox> Xax: Thanks, going to take 20+ years :P
<Monfang> Wanna help me find a word?
<Saturn> 08,01love's in blooooom
<Monfang> I heard it once, it's something like 'shishay' or something
<Spell-of-Gaming> Monfang: Sure.
<Vordox> lawl Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01love's in applebloom
<Monfang> It means to move your hips back and forth in short motions
<Vordox> No
<Monfang> Like a girl would do to take off their panties in a sensual manner
<XAX> ._.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol Saturn
<d3rb> i dont....i ...what
<Saturn> 08,01hmm, idea for a fic...
<Saturn> 08,01with grown-up applebloom
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Saturn: SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEEEE
*Saturn 08,01likes writing about the future of ponies
<Spell-of-Gaming> Monfang: Not in my vocabulary...
<Monfang> I don't know what I heard then
<Saturn> 08,01there's this one i started where pinkie is old and has a granddaughter
<Monfang> I'll just use wiggle
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> 0_o Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01and fluttershy is the only other one of the mane 6 still alive
<Monfang> Does she teach her the Giggle at the ghosties song, Saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01but is a bitter and jaded old mare
<Spell-of-Gaming> Equestrian Pie was damn depressing.
<Saturn> 08,01and blames pinkie for the death of rainbow dash
<Saturn> 08,01unjustly, i might add
<d3rb> thats depressing Saturn
<d3rb> but sounds interesting
<Monfang> Guess what I"m not going to read.
<Saturn> 08,01d3rb: i like sadfic
<d3rb> it sounds good
<XAX> What I found heartstring-playing was Pretty in Pink
<XAX> dat story

<XAX> Airpuff: Saw you come in :<
<Airpuff> XAX: .. aw.. =c
<Saturn> 08,01my two favourite fics are Days of Wasp and Spider (which is a wonderfully written sci-fi fic about ponies and particle accelerators), and Romance Reports (which is an equally wonderfully written sexytimes fic, but has excellent characterisation and development)
<Saturn> 08,01i also liked Macintosh
<Saturn> 08,01which is just epic
<Saturn> 08,01and Binkie Pie, which is absolutely freakin' hilarious
<Saturn> 08,01Ancient Blunders was off to a good start too
<Saturn> 08,01but i think it's been abandoned
<Airpuff> O.o
<Airpuff> Hi Saturn
<Airpuff> xD

*Alicorn_Prince_Shane grabs Airpuff

<Phase4> Alicorn_Prince_Shane, just dont feel like playing it tonight
<Dark_Horst> wait a second... did someone imply there are fics out there with caramel that dont ship him with big mac?
<Kammerjunk> Ere sin could blight or sorrow fade, Death came with friendly care. The opening bud to Heaven conveyed and bade it blossom there.
<Spell-of-Gaming> The original Mother was pretty much grinding and grinding.

<Vordox> Luna: Change? Lawl I see what u did thar

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> VioletGreySha: ahh k
<VioletGreySha> Luna: wana play DD? :)
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: PIPA wasn't really ever anything big, IIRC. Haven't heard a lot about it since SOPA.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> VioletGreySha: thats good
<Luna> 07,01sure
<VioletGreySha> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: IKR?
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: It's a switch and bait. Learn the system
<Kammerjunk> Innit always, though?
<ninja_pony> \o/ hello everypony!
<VioletGreySha> hay ninja_pony
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: For most time, but most of us people in the world is starting to learn it :P
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: That's why I have a very critical eye against most goverments, my own included.
<Spell-of-Gaming> If the goverment is trolling, they better ready their asses when they demand the "no trolling" rule.
<Kammerjunk> I don't even like my current government. They're allegedly socialists, but they don't do a good job of anything.
<Vordox> Then again, Moderator did a TERRIBLE work. BUT do remember that there's factors to take in, World Economy for example caused the huge 15-20% Unemployment

<Spell-of-Gaming> If they include the DS games and the original mobile game (with the DS remake), MORE BONUS POINTS.
<Ghosties> 04For that matter they should include Birth By Sleep Final Mix too
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ooh, and the GBA game, too!
<Ghosties> 04So if the HD collection had the Final Mix versions of KH 1, 2, and BBS I would definitely get it
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol
*Kandarihu has never really played any KH game, but isn't really opposed to it.
<Ghosties> 04Eh...not too big on Chain of Memories :I
<Ghosties> 04Nor am I big on that DS title
<Onyxia> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: maybe sometime later coz now im learning this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=577sva6TkMw at 0:16
<Ghosties> 04But BBS felt like a proper Kingdom Hearts game

<Spell-of-Gaming> If they put the Woody and Lightyear summons and more of the beta stuff seen inside the ROM of KH2 Final Mix. That would be good. :3
<Scarlet> (\ Sweet.
<Ghosties> 04Huh
<Ghosties> 04One of these pics of the box art apparently makes it seem like BBS, KH 1, KH 2, and Chain of Memories are included

<Ghosties> 04Because the MK Kollection a few years ago meant that MK9 was a total failure
<Ghosties> 04Oh wait
<Ghosties> 04It wasn't
<Saturn> 08,01Spell-of-Gaming: it's because of type-coercion
<Saturn> 08,01== is type coercive in JS
<Vordox> Ghosties: There are of course exceptions
<Saturn> 08,01which is why there is... sigh... ===
<Vordox> Like...several years(10+ years) that have some new steam into them
<Saturn> 08,01PHP suffers the same problem
<Spell-of-Gaming> That's... just what the hell.
<Ghosties> 04Then you can't rightfully say that HD collections or any collections for that matter always justify the end of a series :P
<Saturn> 08,01there is abolutely no reason ever for === to exist
<Vordox> Ghosties: Are you saying GoW is a good overal series, or just rehashing?
<Vordox> :P
<Scarlet> Saturn is smart:P
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, off to sort out STUFF
<Ghosties> 04I'm not saying they're good, I'm saying that there are more titles coming out in that series
<Ghosties> 04There's a difference between loss of identity and the end of a series
<Scarlet> Hardly...
<Vordox> Ghosties: Well for me. I actually say that the milkin causes it. :P
<Ghosties> 04Look
<Ghosties> 04Let me give you an example
<Ghosties> 04Silent Hill
<Vordox> Milking it while it's hot, and milking it for easy money decades later. Atleast decades later can be a big hange.
<Vordox> OH GOD
<Ghosties> 04Never once had a collection series introduced to NA
<Ghosties> 04And yet it's STILL GOING
<Ghosties> 04Admittedly it's pretty damn bad these days
<Ghosties> 04Oh wait, jesus
<flutter_spin> ugh. Why did I even bother reading up on a discussion about shipping. *sigh*
<Ghosties> 04The HD Collection
<Ghosties> 04Fuck
<Ghosties> 04See
<Vordox> Whhut?
<Vordox> Ther eis one?
<Ghosties> 04That's how you know things have gotten bad
<thespitfirecolt2> i hate shipping
<Ghosties> 04(or that I've been up all night :D)
<flutter_spin> i hate shipping too
<Ghosties> 04I'm a huge Silent Hill fan and I freaking forgot that there was a HD collection for Silent Hill
<Ghosties> 04Because the HD Collection was done baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadly
<Vordox> Ghosties: Of course, Silent Hill had a ..."Bumpy ride
<Scarlet> I've only played Homecoming.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Frankly, I don't care about shipping these days but Sparity is kinda... idiotic.
<Vordox> But there are some that are new types of followup on the series
<Vordox> (Like Shattered Memories)
<Ghosties> 04Homecoming is terrible
<thespitfirecolt2> i played them all
<Ghosties> 04The worse in the series
<StupidSexyCJ> only SH game i ever played was 4
<Scarlet> I know.
<Viri> 14hello
<XAX> Ghosties: Read Silent Ponyville? :o
<HyperMetalLugia> hi
<Skydroid> Dominooo
<Ghosties> 04I haven't
<Ghosties> 04However
<thespitfirecolt2> ghosties u going to see the new movie
<Ghosties> 04I honestly believe Fluttershy should have been the protagonist in the fanfic
<Vordox> O.o
<Vordox> As the hero?
<Viri> 14I'm so tired
<Ghosties> 04No
<Ghosties> 04As the protagonist
*Viri flops on his bed
<Phase4> Saturn, actualy i disagree with you
<flutter_spin> But I guess I can't stop the fanfics. The only genre of fanfic I like are slice of life and adventure. I don't like any others
<XAX> Ghosties: Silent Ponyville 2
<Skydroid> Same here, Viri
<XAX> Starring: fluttershy
<Ghosties> 04There's a bit of a difference between "hero" and "protagonist"
<XAX> >_>
<Ghosties> 04Also
<Ghosties> 04I was talking about Silent Ponyville, XAX :P
<Ghosties> 04As in the first one :P
*Skydroid flops on the... classroom desk?
<XAX> The first one was great
<Viri> 14xD
<Viri> 14good thing is that I have nothing to do tomorrow
<drf|away> 03DROP ON THE DECK AND FLOP LIKE A FISH
<Ghosties> 04However, someone mentioned Silent Hill 4 and I must say that game was GREAT
<Skydroid> Anyways, exam idle
<drf|away> 03and now to go to class
<Spell-of-Gaming> Protagonist means main character, while hero means... hero. Am I right? :P
<Viri> 14except a stupid poetry to memorize
<Viri> 14see you
<Vordox> Silent Hill 4...
<Vordox> Which part was that again?
<Phase4> Saturn, === as exact vs == as coersive, i cbf converting types and its more convinent to let the runtime do it for me. its trivial to check types with instanceof or typeof. the array comparison though makes no sense
<Ghosties> 04Hero typically implies that the main character can do no wrong, or is without flaw
<flutter_spin> I can see how it can get mixed up. Usually the main character does overcome something.
<Vordox> Oooh
<Phase4> [1] != [1] but [null] == [null] makes no sense
<Ghosties> 04Silent Hill 4 was The Room
<Vordox> It was good?
<Ghosties> 04(Not *that* Room, BTW)
<Vordox> I heard quite a few people saying it was bad
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<Ghosties> 04Very, very good
<Vordox> In comparrison or stand alone?
<Ghosties> 04The atmosphere was surreal and eerie
<flutter_spin> Never played it. I don't like horror.
<Ghosties> 04If you compare 4 to 3, then 3 wins in Gameplay
<Ghosties> 04*gameplay
<Ghosties> 04In fact
<Scarlet> Why are there Clockwork Nurses in Homecoming?
<XAX> I need to play a Silent Hill game.
<Ghosties> 043 wins in gameplay for all original titles
<Vordox> Well the gameplay of SH has never been it's good part, it's storytelling is the reason the series has lived so long
<flutter_spin> Ever watch Zero Punctuation. I love his take on Silent Hill series
<Ghosties> 04The nurses in Homecoming are based off of the nurses in the movie
<Scarlet> Movie?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ghosties: Really?
<Vordox> So ghosties, you are a fan eh...
<Vordox> HEre's a hardcore question
<Vordox> Did you cry when Lisa's true fate was reveled?
<Viri> 14hi Shiny_Latias :P
<Shiny_Latias> Hello :3
<flutter_spin> lol Phase.
<Viri> 14how are you?
<Vordox> Ghosties? D:
<Shiny_Latias> Sleeeeepy~ T-T
<StupidSexyCJ> I liked 4
<flutter_spin> its more specified value cannot equal another specified value, but 'no value' must equal 'no value'
<StupidSexyCJ> the way everything slowly goes to shit in the real world as the story progresses was freaky
<flutter_spin> but yeah, I agree Phase. Doesn't make sense.
<Viri> 14aww x3
<Viri> 14same
<Shiny_Latias> x3
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, Spell. The nurses were based off of the nurses from the film
<Ghosties> 04Which were actually based off of the nurses from Silent Hill 2
<Vordox> Ghosties
<Ghosties> 04Did I cry when Lisa's true fate was revealed? No, but I did think it was an emotional scene, one that I'll remember
<Vordox> Blast from the past HERE! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm2w4aSpiqs
<Vordox> Yeah, I agree.
<Vordox> It was shocking. :(
<Vordox> One of the best pieces o emotional breakdowns in plain view in Game Storytelling from the earlier era of PSX.
<Ghosties> 04Definitely
<Ghosties> 04Still though
<Spell-of-Gaming> The only original monster on the Silent Hill movie was the janitor.
<Ghosties> 04I like Silent Hill 1, don't get me wrong
<Ghosties> 04I just don't like it anymore than 2, 3, or 4
<Vordox> I know
<Vordox> I'm watching it from a storytelling view. :)
<Vordox> Not from a "Game per game" basis
<Ghosties> 04See
<Ghosties> 04The thing about Silent Hill 4
<Vordox> Only else thing that gets close is when Heather finds Harry....
<Ghosties> 04Was that it was just one humongus mind fuck
<Vordox> Sadly, I never got ahold of the 4th. :( So don't know much about it
<Ghosties> 04It doesn't typically follow the..."atmosphere" of typical Silent Hill
<Ghosties> 04As in there's a lot of lighting, you don't have a flashlight, your inventory is reduced to a number of slots, and there are recurring creatures, Ghosts, that chase you and can't die
<Ascendant> rawr
<Viri> 14hi Ascendant :3
<Viri> 14and Soital
<Phase4> Luna, you there?
<Scarlet> So is the Silent Hill movie worth "buying"?
<Luna> 07,01i'm here
<Vordox> Sounds like Shattered Memories. :P
<Ghosties> 04No
<Ghosties> 04Well
<Phase4> Luna, skype
<Ghosties> 04Maybe
<Vordox> A different aspect, we can say
<Ghosties> 04If you're a big fan of the series, then I would say at least rent the movie if possible
<Ghosties> 04Or borrow it
<Ascendant> heya Viri
<Ghosties> 04Don't buy it until you've seen it
<Ghosties> 04Because it was pretty bad
<Scarlet> Is it based on any of the games, or is it it's own tangent?
<Vordox> Own tangent, I think
<Ghosties> 04It takes a lot from the previous games
<Vordox> Loosely followed.
<Ghosties> 04The entire soundtrack is comprised from songs in the games
<Ghosties> 04Save for Ring of Fire, which made me laugh in the theater when I heard it
<Ghosties> 04But uh
<HyperMetalLugia> hi ascendant
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, the film loosely follows Silent Hill 1
<Viri> 14http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxBSYit49c8&feature=youtu.be
<ScriptBot> [1,0You0,4Tube]: StarForge - First Playable Release | by | Length: | Views: 407
<Ascendant> heya HML
<Viri> 14o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Sega Toylet
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Vordox> The only thing pissing me off about that movie, is Cybil. :P
<Ghosties> 04Where Cheryl, known as Sharon in the film, gets lost in Silent Hill after a car accident
<Vordox> If you know what I mean as a character fate.
<Ghosties> 04Bleh
<Ghosties> 04They turned Cybil into something not Cybil
<Vordox> Agreed.
<Vordox> not to mention her part of the story at the end. ._.
<Vordox> THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE THING.
<Ghosties> 04But at least it somewhat follows canon
<Ghosties> 04I mean
<Ghosties> 04She does...well...
<Vordox> Well yeah, it WAS A choice, if I remember.
<Ghosties> 04*Spoilers*
<Ghosties> 04So I can't say
<Vordox> Yeah I know
<Vordox> I get it, Ghosties. It was a choice that could happen, but why choose THAT for the movie, damnit.
<Spell-of-Gaming> *another spoiler incoming*
<Ghosties> 04But the official canon for Cybil is ultimately followed through in the film
<Vordox> O.o
<Spell-of-Gaming> The sequel to the movie follows on how the hell did the kid escape from the underworld.
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (drf-Droid10) 11WB10»11•. 10- HML does them all
<Vordox> It was the OFFICIAL CANON!`?
<Scarlet> Pyramid head was introduced in SH2, yeah?
<Ghosties> 04No no
<Ghosties> 04@Scarlet: Yes
<drf-Droid> LOL wow, nobody with A-G names
<Ghosties> 04Pyramid Head was introduced in Silent Hill 2
<Vordox> What did you mean by official canon then?
<Ghosties> 04Anyways, the ultimate fate of Cybil is followed through
<Ghosties> 04...I'll just say it
<Ghosties> 04Cybil died in Silent Hill in the first game according to canon, and she ultimately dies in the film too
<Viri> 14wb
<Vordox> ...
<Vordox> THAT IS F*CKING BAD
<Vordox> She was my FAVOURITE!
<Vordox> >=(
<Ghosties> 04According to word of god, Cybil is no more
<Ghosties> 04Sorry bro :/
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ghosties: That would later on be confirmed TOO canon by the sequel of the Silent Hill movie. :I
<Vordox> %"#/%)=(&/!(/%=)/!)(!!!!!
<Ghosties> 04:<
<Scarlet> So there is 2 SH movies?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Even too much canon exists
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<Ghosties> 04There's another film coming out
<Ghosties> 04It's in development...maybe post now
<Ghosties> 04Follows Heather Mason and her father, Harry
<Ghosties> 04Now
<Ghosties> 04Mind you
<Ghosties> 04It's the same continuity from the first film
<Ghosties> 04But I feel like there's some serious retconning going on if that's the case
<Spell-of-Gaming> Let's just hope the story is decent this time.
<Spell-of-Gaming> :I
<Ghosties> 04I mean
<Ghosties> 04Holy shit
<Ghosties> 04Sharon and Rose are in the fog world of Silent Hill when they get back home and Chris can't see them because he's in the real world
<Soital> 12hihi
<Ghosties> 04And yet
<Ghosties> 04According to the second film
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ghosties: I think the plot involves on how the hell did Heather escape from the underworld. :I
<Ghosties> 04Sharon is...with Chris
<Ghosties> 04Who is now Harry
<Ghosties> 04And what the fuck happened to Rose?
<Spell-of-Gaming> WRITERS
<Ghosties> 04Bleh
<Ghosties> 04Fucking fuck
<Scarlet> Sounds... easy to follow.
<Ghosties> 04It's confusing
<Vordox> Cyyyyybiiiiiiiil! *Gushes tears*
<Soital> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Soital, you are a 10Diglett.
<Ghosties> 04Sharon and Rose, at the end of the film, escape Silent Hill *the town* and come home
<Ghosties> 04But
<Ghosties> 04They're not in the real world
<Ghosties> 04They're still ensnared by the fog reality of Silent Hill
<Ghosties> 04So
<Ghosties> 04How in the world
<Vordox> Oh guys....Silent Hill stories ARE f'cking hard to follow. :P
<Spell-of-Gaming> Just like Homestuck. FUCKING TIME TRAVEL SHIT.
<Ghosties> 04Did Sharon manage to leave the fog world without Rose (who is fucking MIA for all I know, despite being credited as being in the film), and end up with Chris?
<Scarlet> They both used the "Clear Skies" shout.
<Vordox> Spell-of-Gaming: Homestuck is EASY to follow imo XD
<Ghosties> 04And I can't help but the crew spoiled a very important tidbit of info
<Ghosties> 04Chris *is* Harry Mason
<Ghosties> 04....wut?
<Ghosties> 04Really guys?
<Vordox> lolwuut
<Ghosties> 04You're just gonna let that shit go?
<Vordox> HAAALLLOOOYWOOOUUUUD
<Ghosties> 04You're just gonna put it out there like that?
<Ghosties> 04You couldn't save that for the film?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Writers, did you get inspiration from Homestuck? :I
<Ghosties> 04You couldn't at least have had some kind of neat twist?
<Scarlet> Sounds like overconfidence.
<Ghosties> 04Sounds like they dn't know what they're doing...
<Vordox> Ghosties: Follow the game and not the movies. :P Movies have alot of issues with continuity, you should know that by now.
<Ghosties> 04but eh...maybe it'll be better than the first film
<Spell-of-Gaming> At least it's the other way around, or else. TROPETV TO THE RESCUE
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> PrincessLuna: whats ur oponion on the fans saying ur sister and discord were oncew together
<Ghosties> 04Of course, Vordox, but the film was brought up and so I felt compelled to speak on it :P
<Spell-of-Gaming> Sometimes, liscensed games are just bad.
<Vordox> Ghosties: But you get into the slums of movie knowhow then. :D
<StupidSexyCJ> Silent Hill 2: The Movie: The Game, I hope this happens
<Vordox> In case you want to know about the movie, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SCENES imo of Silent Hill, so BIG SPOILERS! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC8i6kUI-R0
<Vordox> This is what you can begin to see.
<Cypresswolf> my order for the Derpy toys are processing now, I"m thinking on sending the 2nd to my Aunt Alison in Maui - I told her about Derpy Hooves when I first got into the fandom last summer, she loves that pony :)
<Shiny_Latias> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Shiny_Latias, you are a 7Kecleon.
<Shiny_Latias> O:
<Vordox> AlAlicorn
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Vordox: how did u like that link i sent u?
<Vordox> I HAD HUGE VOLUME ON
<Ghosties> 04You wanna know why I think 4 was really one of the best in the series? Because it felt like an experiment, and you can see that with the intro to the game. The title intro feels...ambitious and different...new...avant-garde, I'd say. And I believe the game follows that same feeling and style, it feels like if an art student got a hold of the Silent Hill license and make a Silent Hill
<Ghosties> 4game.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Vordox: LOLOLOLOLo
<Vordox> Thank you for NOT scaring me, but making the FULL FUCKING HOUSE hear it when I had my Stereoes in...
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Vordox: soz
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol soz Vordox
<Phase4> i gota test something so have a stream about the Wii
<Vordox> suddenly stream
<Vordox> PHASE!
<Spell-of-Gaming> Phase4: What kind of test? PUZZLE GAME? :P
<Vordox> Also Ghosties There is ONE character I Would love to see more off, it's the Hermit Woman who can live in Silent HIll.
<Phase4> hmmm, we must be the backup
<Vordox> The only one I find interesting
<Phase4> on the'
<Phase4> is there a stream?
<Twi_Fi> 100!
<Vordox> Yes
<Spell-of-Gaming> No stream here, Phase4. :P
<Twi_Fi> ah crap
<Twi_Fi> down to 98
<Ghosties> 04The hermit woman?
<Vordox> The quality of the stream makes the canvas hard to read though, Phase4. Can you increase the sharpening?
<Vordox> The woman that lived outside the church
<Ghosties> 04Oh, you mean Anna?
<Scarlet> HOLEY SHIT HE TORE HER SKIN OFF LIKE IT WAS CLOTHES
<Vordox> Ghosties: Think so
<Ghosties> 04^
<Ghosties> 04Yeah
<Ghosties> 04I don't think you'll be seeing Anna again :I
<Vordox> Scarlet: Yes....Yes...
<Spell-of-Gaming> Scarlet: I was just... oh my god what
<Vordox> Why not Ghosties ? D: Something happened to her?(Don't spoil in case)
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dat stream
<Phase4> there we go
<Ghosties> 04Scarlet...already did
<StupidSexyCJ> what do we have here?
<Phase4> aparently i had the steam open three times
<Vordox> DO NOT USE GRAY ON GRAY TEXT IDIOTS
<Vordox> You have HIGH education and IQ
<Vordox> Think
<Scarlet> but, i have a few questions.
<Vordox> woot Scarlet ?
<Scarlet> Wasn't the SH main a guy?
<Ghosties> 04Main?
<Vordox> Harry yes
<Ghosties> 04Ah
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, Harry was a guy in Silent Hill 1
<Scarlet> Pyramidhead was in SH2, not 1
<Ghosties> 04Wait, what are you asking?
<Scarlet> The movie has a female main.
<Ghosties> 04Right
<Vordox> Scarlet: Ah, that's another character that has alot of screen time. Only :P
<Ghosties> 04Ohhhhhh, are you asking why Pyramid Head was in the movie?
<Scarlet> Yes, ghosties
<Ghosties> 04Because
<Ghosties> 04Fan service
<Scarlet> lol
<Twi_Fi> *cough*
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ghosties: Actually, JANITOR IDIOT
<Vordox> Ghosties: Not to mention the REALLY stupid way they explain him....If you knw what I mean, Ghosties . ._.
<Ghosties> 04There was zero reason for Pyramid Head to be in the movie
<Ghosties> 04He's an executioner that punishes people
<Ghosties> 04What has Rose got to be punished for, what does Cybil got to be punished for, or Sharon, or Chris
<Ascendant> I commented on drf's profile
<Ghosties> 04They're not flawed characters
<Ascendant> EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE IT!
<Ascendant> lol no
<Viri> 14o.o
<Ascendant> buthi
<Ascendant> butthi
<Ascendant> but hi
<Ascendant> ffs
<Viri> 14butthi
<Ascendant> stuf
<Ascendant> stuf
<Ascendant> stfu
<Ascendant> can't type today
<drf-Droid> LOL butthi
<Viri> 14xD
<Cypresswolf> I think the appearance of Pyramid Head in the movie was purely fanservice
<Ghosties> 04And I hate, hate, hate, hate, HATE his design in the film
<Spell-of-Gaming> I hate how the sudden fanservice. :I
<Ghosties> 04Ever since then he's become the subject of every yaoi fangirl's dream
<Shiny_Latias> Ascendant, why are you talking to your butt? o.o
<Vordox> ....
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ghosties: THIS.
<Vordox> LOLWUT reaction there Ghosties
<drf-Droid> WHY NOT
<Ghosties> 04Fucking anime girls LOVE him now and shit
<Vordox> Ghosties: Wasn't there a way to explain it based on Harry's "being there"?
<StupidSexyCJ> Ghosties: anime fangrils loe anything without a shirt
<Ghosties> 04No, because Chris wasn't in Silent Hill to be punished
<HyperMetalLugia> hiii
<HyperMetalLugia> byee
<StupidSexyCJ> *love
<Ghosties> 04Chris never even went to the other worlds of Silent Hill
<Vordox> Nono, I mean WHY Pyramid head EXISTS cause of Harry
<Vordox> (Game wise was it then?)
<Ascendant> no u
<Ascendant> drf go check your profile
<Ghosties> 04Pyramid Head doesn't exist for any one character
<drf-Droid> link it
<Spell-of-Gaming> StupidSexyCJ: Visual novels are guilty of this. :I
<Ascendant> don't judge me
<drf-Droid> >phone
<Ascendant> I'm bored
<Vordox> I think he did, I remember it being explained somewhere and I got pissed and stopped reading. ><
<Ghosties> 04And you're thinking of James from Silent Hill 2, because that was PH's introduction into the series
<Ascendant> http://www.lugia.us/forum/profile/drfsupercenter/
<drf-Droid> I judge you all I want
<Ascendant> Thanks
<Saturn> 08,01so much red
<drf-Droid> :O
<Ascendant> That's all I wanted to know
<Saturn> 08,01<3
<drf-Droid> you can link by profile name?
<Ghosties> 04Silent Hill is serious business
<Vordox> It was something like "Harry" or "James" had some issues of consciences that MADE PH to be existing?
<Ascendant> that's the link I got...
<Ghosties> 04Right, you're thinking of James
<drf-Droid> ...
<drf-Droid> where the fri=k
<drf-Droid> *c
<drf-Droid> did you get that
<Shiny_Latias> That's terrifying..
<Ghosties> 04And on that...I don't believe Pyramid Head was made for only James
<drf-Droid> that's about as good as the show itself
<drf-Droid> :P
<Vordox> Well, it was explained at that time. Not the following and merely got retconned or something.
<Ghosties> 04I think Pyramid Head manifested because James wanted him to, because he wanted to be punished for his actions
<Shiny_Latias> O:
<Vordox> YES!
<Vordox> That part.
<Viri> 14o.o
<Ghosties> 04It wasn't that James *made up* Pyramid Head
<thespitfirecolt2> so ghosties what is your fav sh game
<Ghosties> 042
<drf-Droid> o.o?
<Ascendant> lmfao

<Viri> 14old joke :(
<drf-Droid> heh

<Ascendant> I should do that too
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...that's kind of a lie.
<drf-Droid> I can upload mine :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> It depends on the game if it has "Castlevania syndrome".
*drf-Droid hides
<Luna> 07,01meow

<Spell-of-Gaming> Garbage data.
<Spell-of-Gaming> :I
<drf-Droid> uggggggh math homework

<Shiny_Latias> But I tried it, and I liked it :P
<Vordox> XD
<drf-Droid> mainly what I hate is the fact that it's impossible to go anywhere online without seeing MLP stuff
<Spell-of-Gaming> Phase4: What the hell.

<drf-Droid> I don't like movies like Bambi though
<Ascendant> THAT'S when I get annoyed
<Viri> 14^
<drf-Droid> same here derp
<Phase4> the fact that it's a custom kernel is strange and a bad choice as you will see here
<Ascendant> and you're doing it atm drf
<drf-Droid> hence my hatred of bronies
<Soital> 12hmm didn't know that =o

<Twi_Fi> Hello LunaLookin
<Phase4> which i streamed a while ago
<flutter_spin> I just finished reading an article about Koreans demanding money refunds because they couldn't log into Diablo 3. Korea is having a fit with Blizzard right now.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Vordox: Touch screens can be annoying sometimes
<Spell-of-Gaming> With the small buttons and all
<Vordox> Spell-of-Gaming: Who the feck uses touchpads...?
<flutter_spin> anyone who loves their iphone
<Spell-of-Gaming> Vordox: ...Apple.

<flutter_spin> and uncles.
<Twi_Fi> Hello chrysalis
<chrysalis> Hiya twi_fi
<Phase4> the homebrew channel is an excelent bit of software
<Phase4> and every console should have a vendor suported version to allow user code
<Mish> hi
<Phase4> ohai Mish
<Twi_Fi> Hello Mish
<flutter_spin> that dude is cool. He has a handless mic :)
<chrysalis> All did, then Sony got rid of it
<Mish> :) I have a god 45 min. before the school bus arrives
<Vordox> Sad truth, Phase
<Phase4> chrysalis, xbox doesnt
<Mish> Hm?
<Phase4> you can develop on the pc but cant actualy get it onto the console without paying for a licence
<flutter_spin> interesting vid. I don't think I learned anything new, but neat.
<WallDives> Good morning, all.
<Mish> dat video womt show up
<XAX> G'day WallDives
<Vordox> WhY aren't you guys LEARNING?

<Vordox> The hakcers.
<|Discord|> Good morning everypony
<Mish> Hackers?!
<Mish> 0-0
<Phase4> hardware hackers
<WallDives> who got hit?
<Mish> When did dat happen?
<Vordox> Phase4: Why are they so dumb they cannot see what consequences they are causing, Phase4?
<Phase4> this was from 2008
<Vordox> Even after proving it over and over and over again
<Phase4> when they hacked the Wii
<WallDives> ah.
<Phase4> Vordox, because managment afaik
<Vordox> Management for what?
<flutter_spin> Why must I get tired just before leaving for work? I wake up 2 hours beforehand, wide awake, and before leaving to work I want to sleep.
<|Discord|> Why would anypony want to hack anyone? For the ching ching?
<Mish> :( my mom won't let me stay in school during the last extra mounth of school after 8th grade graduation
<Vordox> A simple "I want to add this background" causes hug gaps into the gaming society ><
<alexxm> hey guys
<Phase4> managment in microsoft nintendo and sony
<Phase4> less sony than the others but still
<Mish> now I can't stay to visit the highschool with the rest of my book club :(
<Vordox> Phase4: No Ididdn't mean like that. ><
<Phase4> hackers are not a market they target, which is a little silly
<WallDives> hi alexxm.
<Vordox> Remember the Half Life Source code f'ckup? LIKE THAT
<alexxm> hey WallDives what have you been up to
<WallDives> alexxm: So, Orton is suspended.
<Vordox> This is the same thing, happening over and over again
<Mish> I hate that I have no idea what anypony is talking about, so I'll just shut up and listen
<alexxm> yeah i heard about that WallDives what did they get him on
<spacemarshmellow> is there a stream going on
<Mish> Crap! Bus COME BACK!
<Phase4> the ps3 was a special case, after they removed linux hackers poured into it
<Phase4> and thus it was hacked
<flutter_spin> lol Mish. There was a stream.
<WallDives> alexxm: dem drugs.
<Phase4> several times
<Phase4> and some realy stupid bugs were found deep in the system
<alexxm> so how long is he off WallDives
<Phase4> allso bootmii is better than the stock bootloader
<Phase4> less likley to brick
<WallDives> alexxm, 2nd offense, 60 days.
<Phase4> default bootloader bricked ~1% of consoles on one or two of the system updates
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane licks alexxm
<flutter_spin> Do you think they just finally gave up on fixing all the bugs and released it, due to pressure of producers?
<alexxm> huh lot of people have been caught lately WallDives
*alexxm hugs Alicorn_Prince_Shane hows your day been
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> good alexxm
<Spell-of-Gaming> Stream just buffered for meh
<Phase4> yeah, i'm not streaming anything right now
<flutter_spin> stream just ended. I gotta' go anyways
<WallDives> alexxm, not really. Just a shallow roster, either because of lack of prepardness, or because FCW has a lot of their talent atm. They're in a rebuild phase.
<Ghosties> 04Oh god, Bushido Blade
<Phase4> have some music
<Ghosties> 04It's been sooooooooo long
<Ghosties> 04Whoa, whoa, whoa
<Ghosties> 04>FCW

<Ghosties> 04More than likely a smark
<Iron_Edge> Quiet day in the prison camp today is it not?
<Ghosties> 04And then WallDives doesn't speak :/
<Twi_Fi> Hello Iron_Edge
<WallDives> sorry Ghosties.
<Iron_Edge> Twi_Fi: I love you....
<Iron_Edge> Twi_Fi: Your name :)
<WallDives> I'm more casual, but I folow.
<Twi_Fi> Iron_Edge: Thanks :D
<Iron_Edge> WallDives: /)
<WallDives> follow^
<Ghosties> 04You know FCW
<WallDives> so, I guess i'd be a "smark" by definition, since I look at dirt sheets, although I just take it more as a show as is, than anything serious.
<WallDives> I do.
<alexxm> hey Iron_Edge hows your day been
<WallDives> I also know OVW, and I've been to some ROH events.
<Iron_Edge> alexxm: Meh
<Ghosties> 04Ah, so then you're like my friend who doesn't really watch the shows every week but follows the stories and angles through the net
<Iron_Edge> WallDives: Oh....thats kool ignore me...
<WallDives> sorry Iron_Edge.
<WallDives> Ghosties, I do watch the shows every week.
<Ghosties> 04I've never been to Ring of Honor, though I'd like to
<Ghosties> 04Oh?
<Iron_Edge> WallDives: no no.....too ******* late...
<Vordox> Stream is down? D:
<Ghosties> 04Then I wouldn't really call you a casual :P
*Phase4 likes this song
<Phase4> Vordox, its what now?
<Vordox> Oh, playing song, dang
<WallDives> Ghosties, there was a championship match near where I lived.
<Vordox> Nothing, I just found a great song. =3 That I wanted to share
<WallDives> actually, the day before a RAW was there.
<Vordox> Dream Evil: The Chosen Ones.
<WallDives> Iron_Edge, sorry, 3 different conversations.
<Ghosties> 04Speaking on the indy feds, I'd love to go to CHIKARA sometime
<alexxm> i would go to a ring of honor show but i don't think they come to england
<WallDives> yeah, true damn story.
<Iron_Edge> WallDives: /) <----thats all I did.. but its kool guy..
<WallDives> Iron_Edge, (\
<Iron_Edge> WallDives: *Rejects your bro hoof*
<Spell-of-Gaming> No stream, or did mine derp? :P
<WallDives> Ghosties, yeah, I'm pretty firmly planted in former JCP/WCW/FCW land.
<Iron_Edge> Spell-of-Gaming: Your derpin bro.
<Ghosties> 04Never heard of JCP, though it does sound familiar...
<Malavolent> Ello there everypony.
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: JC pennies....-lol
<WallDives> hi Malavolent.
<Twi_Fi> Hello Malavolent
<WallDives> no.
<Iron_Edge> Malavolent: /)
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai Malavolent
<WallDives> Jim Crokett Promotions.
<XAX> Holy dear lord Aizen is dominating
<Malavolent> Iron_Edge: Oh wel... (\
<WallDives> the predecessor to WCW.
<Iron_Edge> Malavolent: Thats how I say hi.....problem bro????
<Ghosties> 04OHHHHH
<Ghosties> 04Jim Crocket
<alexxm> hey Malavolent hows your day been
<Malavolent> Iron_Edge: Not really, should it be a problem?
<Ghosties> 04The territory
<WallDives> yeah.
<Ghosties> 04Now I know what you're talking about
<WallDives> dat South Ohio.
<Malavolent> alexxm: Hey, quite okay, how about you?
<Spell-of-Gaming> No stream, I see?
<Spell-of-Gaming> :P
<Iron_Edge> Malavolent: Nah, I'm just pulling your tail guy. :)
<alexxm> i really started getting into wrestling last year to be honest
<alexxm> i'm good Malavolent
<Ghosties> 04No wrong time to get into wrestling
<Ghosties> 04Plenty of things to look at in the past
<Ghosties> 04For when you have a shit present product
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: Explain something to me then
<WallDives> I was in-and-out. I watched WCW and ECW when I was younger, after the buyouts, I kinda dropped off.
<Ghosties> 04Yep?
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: Is that stuff real?
<WallDives> hell no.
<Ghosties> 04Define "real"
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: Cause some of the punches look kinda if-y to me
<alexxm> old undertaker matches started it for me so i got the undertakers dvd
<Ghosties> 04Some of the punches can be real
<WallDives> real enough for injury, not real fights.
<Ghosties> 04But that's called
<Ghosties> 04"being stiff"
<Ghosties> 04When you actually connect attacks
<Ghosties> 04The injuries are real (typically, unless it's part of an angle)
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: I mean the most painful thing i've ever seen is someone getting a broken arm
<Ghosties> 04But the animosity or whatever? The "hate" between one wrestler and another is purely for show
<Ghosties> 04The feuds are fake
<Ghosties> 04Or rather scripted
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: Aside from that. For giant men with hercules bodies they dont seem to genuily hurt each other at all. If ever.
<Ghosties> 04The feuds are scripted
<Ghosties> 04Well that's called "no selling" if they don't react to getting "hurt"
<WallDives> Hogan is famous for it.
<Ghosties> 04So is Warrior
<alexxm> so's undertaker
<WallDives> so is Taker, Goldberg, Warrior...
<Ghosties> 04Oh god, Warrior is soooooo famous
<Ghosties> 04Actually
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: Ehhh.....Then why is it millions of rubes will pay out the whazoo to go and see a LIE
<Ghosties> 04I'd consider "no selling" to be a part of Taker's gimmick
<alexxm> same here Ghosties
<Ghosties> 04He "rises from the dead" after seemingly getting hit with a particularly "devestating maneuver"
<WallDives> although, Warrior is more famous for being nuts.
<Ghosties> 04Because, Iron_Edge, for the entertainment
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: Wow
<WallDives> yep.
<alexxm> didn't he actully change his name to warrior WallDives
<WallDives> alexxm, he did.
<chrysalis> Why do people see films, they are fake too
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: your the first person to actually give a legit reason for that question.
<Spell-of-Gaming> NO STREAM? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qLlyqR19gU
<Nerom> Good day everypony :P
<Ghosties> 04You don't watch to see two men fight, if you want to see a real fight then watch boxing or UFC
<WallDives> remember, "wrestling" is theater.
<Twi_Fi> Hello Nerom
<alexxm> hey Nerom hows your day been
<Spell-of-Gaming> ohai Nerom
<WallDives> hi Nerom.
<WallDives> I was at Bellator 2.
<Nerom> Heyall :)
<Ghosties> 04But yes, pro wrestling is theatrical
<Ghosties> 04It's a play, of sorts
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: Thats kinda boring to a point though. In UFC one guy falls on the ground then they lay there in the missionary for awhile beating each other with there hands up until one guy is hurt to bad.
<alexxm> i actully went to a show this british promotion did near where i live
<Ghosties> 04Well that's why pro wrestling is typically faster
<Ghosties> 04In real fights it's meticulous
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: Atleast with wrestling they throw each other out of the ring and stuff.
<chrysalis> Iron everyone enjoys different aspects of it
<Ghosties> 04The action is slow paced, because acting too fast means that you're going to make a mistake and get punished for it
<WallDives> yeah.
<Ghosties> 04That's a real fight in boxing or UFC
<Ghosties> 04Especially boxing
<WallDives> and god help you if you miss a takedown.
<Ghosties> 04But in wrestling it's all choreographed
<Ghosties> 04There are specific spots that wrestlers will do
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: And thats what kills me about it.
<Nerom> To about 60% yes
<Nerom> And all the talk is BS
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: I want to see completely random acts of violence. In a ring. With wrestlers.
<Nerom> In wrestling that is
<WallDives> its entertaining, though.
<Ghosties> 04Haha
<Ghosties> 04Nah
<Nerom> Indeed
<WallDives> its also entertaining when they botch.
<Ghosties> 04Sorry
<Ghosties> 04Go watch TNA if you want just random spouts of violence
<Ghosties> 04That place is a fucking mess
<Nerom> But to much comersals for my taste
<WallDives> TNA is getting better, imo.
<alexxm> Iron_Edge check out some hardcore matches then
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: -lol-
<Ghosties> 04At least they got Russo out of there
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol i will lol the day some one streams UFC
<Ghosties> 04God
<Dark_Horst> well, cou could also watch these two fight. a lot more entertaining than wrestling, if you ask me http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwNVQvygCNQ
<WallDives> Also, Ghosties, you watch Botchamania?
<Ghosties> 04YES
<Ghosties> 04All the time
<Nerom> This is awesome Dark_Horst
<Ghosties> 04I was about to say that you have a point, that botches can be *hilarious*
<Spell-of-Gaming> Japan is crazy. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deC2uxu0XA4 :P
<Ghosties> 04Especially if you know the context behind a certain botch
<WallDives> right.
<Ghosties> 04But sometimes botches can be really dangerous
<Ghosties> 04Sometimes they end up getting actually hurt
<WallDives> dont forget Brawl for All.
<Ghosties> 04What was Brawl for All?
<alexxm> like that pedrigree that turned into a piledriver Ghosties
<WallDives> that was the reason why I didnt watch attitude-era WWE.
<WallDives> WWF, whatever.
<Iron_Edge> I'm not a big wrestling fan but then again if you saw me in real time you wouldnt think I have a twilight sparkle plushie.
<WallDives> Ghosties, a shoot-fight tournament.
<Ghosties> 04Ah
<Ghosties> 04Those
<Iron_Edge> Life is fun with stereo types. There natures little secret holders.
<WallDives> Russo!
<Ghosties> 04WWF doesn't promote those anymore
<Ghosties> 04Er
<Ghosties> 04WWE, rather
<WallDives> pretty much ended the career of Dr. Death.
<Ghosties> 04Poor bastard
<WallDives> that man was AWESOME.
<Ghosties> 04He's dead now too
<WallDives> yeah, sadly.
<Ghosties> 04Yeah
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: Ojh the irony.
<Ghosties> 04Eh
<Ghosties> 04Maybe
<WallDives> he survived cancer, then it came back.
<Ghosties> 04But I don't really laugh at wrestlers dying
<WallDives> throat cancer at that.
<Ghosties> 04I've been a wrestling fan since I was a kid
<Ghosties> 04I'm 24 now
<WallDives> Ghosties: same here.
<Iron_Edge> I cant say I feel bad for people who smoke and get cancer.
<WallDives> 23 though.
<Ghosties> 04If you want pure entertainment, go WWE
<Ghosties> 04If you want...whatever the fuck TNA is, go TNA
<Iron_Edge> Honestly, it says on the pack "this will probably give you cancer....cancer is bad"
<Ghosties> 04If you want pure wrestling, legitimate wrestling, go ROH
<Twi_Fi> Hello valoreins and Onyxia
<Ghosties> 04If you want referential self humor and wrestling that doesn't take itself too seriously, go CHIKARA
<valoreins> ohai bronystate :D
<Onyxia> ;o
<Onyxia> hi
<WallDives> Like I said, TNA is getting better, though.
<Iron_Edge> valoreins: /)
<Onyxia> Twi_Fi: when did u see me join? mIRC?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm actually suprised to hear that Vocaloid concerts have singers backstage, which is really cool.
<Ghosties> 04Because there's nothing like selling an invisible hand grenade
<WallDives> hi Onyxia, valoreins.
<Iron_Edge> Onyxia: /)
<alexxm> hey valoreins and Onyxia hows your day been
<Twi_Fi> Hello Dken2021

<WallDives> hahaha.
<Onyxia> Twi_Fi: sweet :P
<Dken2021> ohai Twi_Fi

<Ghosties> 04And they actually *slow down time, including the commentators*

<drf-Droid> and that was his reply
<Ghosties> 04Huh, it's possible we passed by in a hallway or something
<drf-Droid> XD

<WallDives> the fact that that is on CNN makes me smile.
<alexxm> good to hear |Discord|
<Tov|MoatEel> panda I agree. Still though I can't help but wonder why the media hasn't asked about this sooner.
<cowvarkian> it be satire panda...
<Lil_B> Iron_Edge 350kbit/s is the maximum I can get in my villige XD, mabe I should buy 30miles of Fiber to connect it to somewhere...
<Vordox> Do you remember a certain 3D short movie about sackboys, but in 3D movie with a big "Robot cat/dog"thingie?

<|Discord|> Nothing is being streamed? Why?
<panda> cowvarkian: god I hope so

<Sylandest> |Discord|: we just finished a short film, should be up again in a moment
<WallDives> Panama^
<|Discord|> Sylandest: What short film was it?
<Lil_B> heck yeah, 2 new Albums in the Indie Music Bundle :D
<cowvarkian> do you honestly think that people are asking if romney is a unicorn?
<panda> WallDives: XD so it was just a douche and terd sandwich election XD
<Iron_Edge> Lil_B: -lol- they tell you that technology is the fututre. And then stuff starts failing. Meh
<alexxm> |Discord because they're having one more drink at the sunken norwgien
<WallDives> panda, as all American elections are.

<|Discord|> I WILL
<WallDives> and that, as they say, is that.
<cowvarkian> ill brb
<Tov|MoatEel> WallDives: That only proves how vast and deep the coverup is.
<|Discord|> Phase4: Would you guys ever stream stuff from newgrounds?
<|Discord|> I DID HA

*Iron_Edge orders a McScootaloo

<Scootaloo> :c
<Tov|MoatEel> Well, the Obama-ate-dog people proved how stupid the whole dog scandal is. hopefully this unicorn thing will have similar success.
<Sylandest> |Discord|: the power of a good marketing campaign and the effectiveness of the internet combined
<Iron_Edge> RAWRity: this taste like rainbows....

<Airpuff> Lil_B: Give it a go! Might be it turns out ... unexpectedly good? xD
<Sylandest> Lil_B: then show it to the first gal and see what she says, hehe. Its better to try it with someone with an open mind than someone who would outright reject it from the get-go
