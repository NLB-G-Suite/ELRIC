<Vivix> the ears might actually be too low for a horse- yeah- usually horses have them pretty far up
<jcelios> so Stellvia is the name of the space station?
<CCharmanderK> Dunno how to explain it, but I'm just not too terribly interested.
<MaxTheBrony> Right , my perspective is crap , i need to train on that :D
<Vivix> make a vanishing point, and raw him as a very basic shape, just to train on it
<CCharmanderK> DJ out of f:(king nowhere?
<MaxTheBrony> What about the head , should i go to more simlyfied version?
<MaxTheBrony> simplyfied*
<CCharmanderK> *Simplified
<Jmo> simplified.
<Snow> MY BRAND
<pony_3045> creaper
<Vivix> well- hm- the ears are a bit loow, as Sumica said- but otherwise, it is manly- pronounced
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates - December 6th
<MaxTheBrony> Right gonna fix the ears
<pony_3045> tonn of tnt
<CCharmanderK> Thanks, prince-dari

<Jmo> Thanking a bot post.
<Vivix> his hooves-
<Jmo> Lel.
<CCharmanderK> RD looks like a pair of technicolor pliers.
<Vivix> they look a bit rocky
<MaxTheBrony> Ah
<MaxTheBrony> how can i fix :P?
<Vivix> but that really depends on how you see their hooves, as mlp-ponies vs horses/ponies
<MaxTheBrony> Thats i dont know
<CCharmanderK> Ah, simple PMVs.
<MaxTheBrony> If i should go Mlp way
<MaxTheBrony> or semi realism
<Sumica> 00,10well it's just the fettlock thing
<pony_3045> i came to dig dig dig

<MaxTheBrony> Yeah
<pony_3045> creapers hail
<Jmo> Thought so.
<MaxTheBrony> heh
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Vivix> and remember, the front of the hooves basically should be a bit smooth transition from the leg
<CCharmanderK> A lot of people hate Twist for some reason. I think they missed the point of her character.
<Lindeman> What are you talking about?
<Snow> Bet you can't guess my OC's name
<Vivix> and the shading should be smooth too, it's a nail
<BladedWings> The derpy was doubled ^_^
<Jmo> It's Snow.
<Snow> wrong

<jcelios> I like stream ^_^
<Snow> Some people just want to see the stream burn...
<Vivix> I'm abit curious abou the foreleg max- but it can be hard because of style differences?
<Jmo> Needs to lighten up and just enjoy what's on.
<Everlasting_Joy> I love this opening song :).
<Sumica> 00,10What's the saying, You get what you payfor.
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Jmo> As thou are taking time from their day to stream whatever is on.
<MaxTheBrony> Vivix: Yeah i reused my OC front legs
<Snow> Sumica: but we arn't paying anything

<MaxTheBrony> So it didnt quite fit
<Vivix> ahh
<Sumica> 00,10Exactly Snow
<MaxTheBrony> Im going to remkae the body now
<MaxTheBrony> What would be a good pose?
<Vivix> cause- this really depends a bit on style and preference- but horse forelegs are a bit complicated sometimes-
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah agreed
<Sumica> 00,10She over thinks
<Snow> but if i would pay i would ask: show me some stuff, i don't care what
<Jmo> Giving all this advice yet I see barely any art from you Vivix.
<Vivix> Well, I like the pose, just a bit more natural perspective, shows a lot of strength

<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bye Snow. Take care
<alexxm> bye Snow
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: maybe because she has work to do......or it's too exhasusting for her.....or it's not her thing.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: I try them, but only the ones where you can do things without knowing perfectly the characters' moveset
<Dark92Enigma> i dunno
<Snow> aaand nobody saw what i did there
<Snow> bye ^^
<MadSurge> Shizuka: ergo, Mortal Kombat is a terrible game

<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: i understand, even though i grew up with MK, SF and the MvC series
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Avatar state?
<MadSurge> Sumica: you should stream Avatar more often

<BladedWings> hi Nittany_Discord ^_^

<Shizuka> 13why so hatless and colorless?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Nittany_Discord! *dusts and cleans*
<MadSurge> Hello Nittany_Discord :)
*Bronysith licks and glomps Nittany_Discord
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Nittany_Discord :)
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: And Izzy learned noting from the movie, computer gets BSoD from a viurs, digital worrld destroyed. The end.
<Nittany_Discord> Lost my colors but not my hat.
<Dark92Enigma> Hi Nittany_Discord!
<Sumica> 00,10sure was lucky all the crest were hidden in the same desert
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: well they still didn't get nuked right?
<Dark92Enigma> oh, THIS ONE
<alexxm> why all the crests hidden in the same desert
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: Nope. They killed Diaboromon at the very last second.
<Dark92Enigma> I WON'T SPOIL
<Invimon> Sumica, yeah it kinda appears rushed how fast they get their crests
<YokusaHHart> dem glyphs
<Dark92Enigma> but it's great
<MadSurge> Of course it's a trap
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm It's a small digiworld after all-.---
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: I still prefer the Digimonless movie on that :D
<Bronysith> ugh, the animation for this is so....strange
<AssaultWithEmbraces> "It's not like we're in a computer"
<Bronysith> WHERE THE FUCK ARE THEIR NOSES?!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> DIGITAL world.
<Bronysith> and why are their hands so large?
<Bronysith> lol
<YokusaHHart> Wow, I forgot how derped everyone looked in the first season
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Oh god, Izzy's eyes.
<MadSurge> Bronysith: I stole them!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> They're spaced out like a bug
<MadSurge> Bronysith: and next, THEIR FACES
<Sumica> 00,10hacking montage
*Saturn 08,01dogs
<MadSurge> No they're not, they're just files!
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: and their eyes
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bronysith, and their hands
<Bronysith> the animation is not my cup of tea
<Bronysith> god, what were the animators on?
<Dark92Enigma> And that's the same place our noses must be!
<MadSurge> So this is the off model episode? :D
<YokusaHHart> The Digimon look fine, but the human characters.... ._.
<Sumica> 00,10if they are on the internet then where is all the porn?
<MadSurge> Sumica: Ikr
<Bronysith> Sumica: 4chan
<ekips> and where are the ponies?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Silly Sumica, this is a kids show << >>
<MadSurge> ekips: they still didn't exist then
<Invimon> Sumica, not in the desert ^^
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: no....this is actually a relevant episode.....but the animation is wrong
<Bipolarized> Most disappointing internet world ever.
<Sumica> 00,10wait if every thing is made of data.......
<valoreinsmon|Drawing> there must be an island of porn files somewhrere there
<Sumica> 00,10then they are the porn

<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/zI5B5.jpg
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: yeah, therefore the offmodel episode (with story) :D
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Izzy's compute is loud.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: nomnomnom
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Shizuka: nuuu they killed Santa ;A;
<BladedWings> Not Saaaanta!
<MadSurge> It's a trap!
<Invimon> oh Nanomon :d
<BladedWings> :O Nanomon!
<YokusaHHart> Shipping!
<Dark92Enigma> it's because her nose is back
<Bipolarized> Now kiss!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Let the shipping begin! Oh wait, it already has.
<pony_3045> hey you jew shoud kiss
<Bronysith> they have no eye color
<Bronysith> or well
<pony_3045> dat nose dote
<Bronysith> just one solid color

<Invimon> so, theoretically they could clone themself?

<AssaultWithEmbraces> Now flip him off!
<MadSurge> KILL HIM NOW
<Sumica> 00,10Tai is full of stupid
<pony_3045> Concert Crush (Love Serenade): Breaks the opponent's heart and makes their fighting spirit vanish. Dark Network (Dark Spirits): Attacks with a dark sphere that consumes everything it touches.
<Dark92Enigma> Sumica: in this episode, Tai is at his stupidest
<Bronysith> tee
<Dark92Enigma> TROLOLOLOLO
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Taitroll
<Dark92Enigma> YOU'RE ONLY TWO DAYS BEFORE RETIREMENT
<Dark92Enigma> Just data.......if i would play a drinking game everytime he said that, i would DIE

<Serenity> 'dat Johnny B Goode
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: But still. Sounds like a scam
<pony_3045> use your serenade atack
<Bronysith> so much better than the english version
<AssaultWithEmbraces> ^
<Invimon> indeed it is
<Bipolarized> Sailor moon transformation sequence, go!
<Dark92Enigma> thank you i'll be here all da----wait nopony got my reference
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I can't find a torrent of the subbed version
<YokusaHHart> IMO they're about the same
<Dark_Horst> you obviously have no idea what a sailormoon transformation sequzence is
<Invimon> Bipolarized, but they don't become nude. they rather get armor than loosing cloths
<Bronysith> still, the animation isnt that great, probably just nostalgia glasses
<Dark92Enigma> Bipolarized: come on, their transformation sequence is shorter.
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: yeah, maybe
<aniderp|bestcakeever> back
<Bronysith> nostalgia glasses hit the fans of this, i can see the appeal of this show, but the animation just aint for me
<Dark92Enigma> AssaultWithEmbraces: I found them on youtube, but lost them
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Dark92Enigma: Aaaaaaaaaugh
<Invimon> yeah yeah, block the only digimon's way who has already defeated him once
<Dark92Enigma> JUST DATA........Stop saying that Tai! :[
<YokusaHHart> both Japanese and English have equal amount of annoying voices and good voices....also the Japanese soundtrack doesn't fit the situation at times
<Dark92Enigma> OF COURSE
<Serenity> He's quite suprised to hear that
<Bronysith> Tai
<Bronysith> you're a pansy
<Dark_Horst> well yeah, that'S him right there, not some projection. he's data. if he gets deleated, he's not only dead but nonexistant
<Dark_Horst> lolcactus

<Invimon> *cactus with boxing gloves
<Bronysith> DAT 8 year old just cusses
<Dark92Enigma> Is Tai really worrying over Sora........or his pride is hurt.........NOPE. his pride :|
<Bronysith> dirty dirty show
<YokusaHHart> There's nothing wrong with being afraid for your life...just don't let it stop you from acting
<Serenity> Damn isn't a swear word
<MadSurge> Giant monsters can't take out a monkey that is one third his size
<MadSurge> LOGIC
<Invimon> *Digilogic
<Sumica> 00,10he did't say damn
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: Anime logic, to be exact
<Sumica> 00,10he said fuck
<Dark92Enigma> Serenity: come on, In Japan they have less censorship. they're free to say SHIT
<CCharmanderK> Hey guys, I DIGIMOOOOOOOOOOON
<Sumica> 00,10but they changed it in the sub
<Serenity> MadSurge: Um...The same reason a level 1 Rayquaza can't kill a level 100 pichu
<SafariPony> I should really take my ping off monkey, MadSurge keeps setting it off. :P
<Dark_Horst> why woukld you do that
<Serenity> Sumica: Them sneaky bastards...

<AssaultWithEmbraces> He's 13 hours ahead of me
<Serenity> AssaultWithEmbraces: 11 hours behind*
<cowvarkian> I think theres just a little bit more then something wrong when the Wii U is more expensive on amazon then it is on ebay
<Serenity> At one point in the year, the Aussies are 12 hours ahead

*Sumica slaps wipergone2 with a cinderblock
<Kandarihu> Come to think of it, I guess the failure of this show can serve as an effective argument agianst piracy. This show was probably pirated like crazy instead of being watched normally. So without the support from ad viewership, it was cancelled after 2 seasons.

<CrystalPhoenix> you can get cheap stuff like easycap for 10 bucks
<CCharmanderK> Sha-click.
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: truth be told, everything is 60% cooler when played with a friend :3
<CrystalPhoenix> or go high-tech with blackmagic for 200

<NewDCD> 09,01the Wii was pretty much Nintendo going full retard on third parties
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Wat the
<Pinkies4thWall> I needs that. Seeing as AC6 was my first
<wipergone2> dat solidier
<NewDCD> 09,01they seemed to loosen up for the 3DS
<RarityDiamondBelle> Shark bait
<ACS13123> Shizu is like a honey badger. dont give a shit about getting hit
<BladedWings> Catching the bus, a lot harder in GTA4 :D
<cowvarkian> I'm getting a wii u when I have a job
<NewDCD> 09,01so the 3DS has a pretty damn good lineup for the short time it has in the market
<cowvarkian> which will happen sometime next year
<NewDCD> 09,01and the Wii U probably has the best third party support of any console launch ever, all things considered
<BladedWings> dem poor hotdogs
<cowvarkian> true
<scout19_tf2> porr hotdogs
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: go home. youre drunk
<RarityDiamondBelle> I want a 3DS XL
<cowvarkian> Sumica: go drunk, you're home
<NewDCD> 09,01don't, get the regular model
<cowvarkian> RarityDiamondBelle: please be joking
<pony_3045> yay
<NewDCD> 09,01and then buy the Nyko PowerPak+
<Buytoast> the Xl's are never all that good of an idea
<RarityDiamondBelle> I jk

<Buytoast> too big
<ACS13123> ITS A BUS
<ACS13123> BUUUUUUUUUUS
<NewDCD> 09,01it runs for like 10 bucks online and it doubles your battery time
<RarityDiamondBelle> Beside's it's the same damn thing just bigger.
<scout19_tf2> bus!!!!
<NewDCD> 09,01and it ain't false advertisement because I own it
<cowvarkian> cool
<cowvarkian> so I can't sue you for liabilities?
<VenHur> What's so bad about the basic Wii U?
<CrystalPhoenix> VenHur, it has nothing?
<RarityDiamondBelle> I play this song when i see Babs Seed
<VenHur> And the Deluxe pack?
<NewDCD> 09,01on the 3DS XL's defense, it doesn't seem to just stretch the image, it seems to work at the same native resolution without stretching
<Pinkies4thWall> Shizuka: theyre flying FOREVERRR
<cowvarkian> VenHur: it has slightly more then nothing?
<wipergone2> dat lag
<Pinkies4thWall> :D
<CrystalPhoenix> also VenHur the deluxe is black
<Pinkies4thWall> LOOO
<Pinkies4thWall> OOL
<BladedWings> the shizubus livesssss
<scout19_tf2> dis is where bab seed came from:S
<Buytoast> people hate the Wii U because it's a Nintendo console
<CCharmanderK> Shizuka, wat r u doin
<CrystalPhoenix> that's more than enough for me to get it
<VenHur> Shizuka, you lost your bus, U MAD SISTAH?

<NewDCD> 09,01HONK HONK
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: I like nintendo though...
<cowvarkian> and the Wii U
<Pinkies4thWall> Free of charge, THE SHIZUBUS
<cowvarkian> and the fact that you can attach a 2 terabyte external hardrive
<Buytoast> really it doesn't look too appealing to me until Pikmin 3 comes out
<RarityDiamondBelle> The hell...
<CriticKitten> Shizubus is the best bus.
<Buytoast> then i'll be all over it
<CriticKitten> Fact.
<Cypresswolf> :3 Nopony should die - without riding the Shizubus
<RarityDiamondBelle> Wait,Pikmin 3?
<pony_3045> dat bus
<Pinkies4thWall> I'm Pinkies4thWall, and i approve CriticKitten's message
<VenHur> Pikmin 3 WAS going to a launch title, but then delayed it to 2013.
<scout19_tf2> Sumica: u shud help shizu befor she gets pissed
<CCharmanderK> Shizuka

<Kandarihu> Alright. I can't watch this now, even if I did catch up, which I never did. Thanks for streaming this anyway.
<thelonecubone1> Bye Kandarihu :)

<scout19_tf2> well i gots to go cya everypony:)
<Buytoast> it's garbage
<NewDCD> 09,01cause it could be because they hadn't finished implementing the layout changes or something

<Buytoast> hell, i still have a tab open with the old layout
<Buytoast> i'm trying to savor it
<sonicdude558> I mean why did Microsoft remove the Start menu
<Kandarihu> I tried to check out the changes to Youtube and saw nothing different.
<CriticKitten> They hadn't finished changing it last time.
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: I've reopened youtube a few times, and its still the old layout

<cowvarkian> prince-dari: there is none
<[]DeadpoolDash> one person with a voting script could win the vote
<cowvarkian> obviously
<DinkyDoo> Suddenly, I begin to burst out laughing.
<Buytoast> they get to say that it was the best
<Dark92Enigma> ANYPONY else on YouTube? i don't know how to post bulletins anymore BECAUSE OF THE NEW LAYOUT
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: in an internet poll? ooh, how prestigious
<Buytoast> they'll grasp at anything
<NewDCD> 09,01YU-HEL-OH
<Buytoast> ANYTHING
<DinkyDoo> Dark soul FROM THE SHADOWSSS
<AJIsHaunter> Dark92Enigma: Yeah, I saw it. It'pretty annoying.
<CrystalPhoenix> Oh gawd
<AJIsHaunter> *it's
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: aren't we part of they?
<Buytoast> oh man
<NewDCD> 09,01OH LORD
<AJIsHaunter> Dat epic suit
<prince-dari> I'd like to think we aren't part of they
<NewDCD> 09,01OH LORD
<KrazyNoobs> ̲My body
<trixie_sprinkle> well, mlp Is a good show, maybe it Does deserve to win. korra is the only other thing on that list i would consider voting for anyway
<EventHorizon> So what, this magic stuff is all a joke or something?
<NewDCD> 09,01THEY JUST
<NewDCD> 09,01THEY JUST
<NewDCD> 09,01OMG
<AssaultWithEmbraces> OH GOD
<prince-dari> Becuase hey are fucking retarded.
<NewDCD> 09,01GUNDAM X REFERENCE
<NewDCD> 09,01<3
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: yeah, they are retarded
<prince-dari> they*
<Buytoast> the dark Flame Master cannot be stopped
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsHaunter: we're just getting used to the last one......and i don't know how to send them anymore
<DinkyDoo> T_T
<CrystalPhoenix> they as in who?
<DinkyDoo> Don't shoot somebody on accident!
<NewDCD> 09,01The Dark Flame Master would be useful to have in case of a T-Virus outbreak
<Buytoast> oh no
<CriticKitten> The Dark Flame Master is about to cap a bitch
<Sketch_Tomba_Brony> NewDCD: lol yes
<DinkyDoo> The Dark Flame Master musn't shoot anyone on accident.
<KrazyNoobs> trixie_sprinkle You are smart. I think MLP:FiM is not better because of the show, but because of the amazing fandom that revolves around it.
<[]DeadpoolDash> Young Justice does have a good over-arching storyline
<thelonecubone> NewDCD: Oh god yeah
<thelonecubone> lol
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Dark Flame Master has some spaghettio going on
<KrazyNoobs> Same with Legend of Korra
<KrazyNoobs> But truly, South Park is best animation
<AJIsHaunter> AssaultWithEmbraces: Some epic spaghetti, at that.
<DinkyDoo> HES SO COOOO.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<DinkyDoo> *COOOOOL
<Vordox> ....
<cowvarkian> KrazyNoobs: please be joking
<Buytoast> oh man
<Bronysith> korra is entirely overrated
<Buytoast> it's too much
<NewDCD> 09,01Yuuta used SEXY VOICE
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsHaunter, the hottest spaghetti out the pot and the freshest Ragu
<NewDCD> 09,01it's SUPER EFFECTIVE
<trixie_sprinkle> im ready o sit there and vote for mlp all day if it would mean south park wouldnt win
<DinkyDoo> Who agrres that The Legend of Korra is over rated?
<KrazyNoobs> End of conversation, let's please move on from this stupid argument.
<trixie_sprinkle> but thankfully thats not a danger in any case
<thelonecubone> I ma, play some operation Raccoon city
<DinkyDoo> *Agree
<cowvarkian> DinkyDoo: it is, but I still like it...
<AJIsHaunter> trixie_sprinkle: I never liked South Park from the start.
<Buytoast> legend of korra aint all that good
<CriticKitten> Define where you think people rank it and I'll tell you if that's too high.
<thelonecubone> Buytoast: true
<NewDCD> 09,01problem with Korra: too much emphasis on shipping over plot
<NewDCD> 09,01plot is good but DAMN
<cowvarkian> NewDCD: theres an emphasis on shipping?
<NewDCD> 09,01it's not a romance show, don't try to make it one
<DinkyDoo> I fail at drawing, so I trace...
<trixie_sprinkle> mlp Does deserve to win, not a lot of competition in any case
<CrystalPhoenix> Steve Blum made the show Korra good
<cowvarkian> trixie_sprinkle: I don't think it should win
<DinkyDoo> I like MLP: FIM and Gravtiy Falls.
<cuteness_kitteh> Ehhh...
<AJIsHaunter> Plus, it's condensed into a short amount of episodes, so the pacing's pretty bad.
<prince-dari> Eh, it wouldn't win if people actually played fair, I'm pretty sure.
<[]DeadpoolDash> Korra would have been a lot better if it had the 26 One Hour episodes it was originally planned for. They cut out a lot of story and development
<trixie_sprinkle> cowvarkian: well what else should? its an empty list, only korra is good
<cowvarkian> trixie_sprinkle: uh... no?
<DinkyDoo> WORLD DOMINATION!!
*cuteness_kitteh eats potato while argument continues
<cowvarkian> trixie_sprinkle: about everything on there except for bob's burgers and family guy are any good
<cowvarkian> and south park
<trixie_sprinkle> prince-dari: well define fair, the fans for a show always vote for the show, mlp has the biggest fandom, so it would probably win. plus having a big fandom means its a good show too
<Buytoast> do you even gravity falls?
<potato_pony> cuteness_kitteh: D:
<prince-dari> >biggest fandom
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: I do even gravity falls
<potato_pony> Y-You monster
<prince-dari> Not likely
<trixie_sprinkle> cowvarkian: so...... the clone wars is good?
<cuteness_kitteh> potato_pony: N-Not you...
<prince-dari> Also fair as in one vote each
<prince-dari> Rather than all the people going around voting 100 times
<[]DeadpoolDash> clones wars is kind of meh
<cowvarkian> trixie_sprinkle: I think it is, but I'm a rabid fanboy, so my opinion is invalid
<Bronysith> trixie_sprinkle: star trek has a bigger fandom
<trixie_sprinkle> prince-dari: i mean biggest fandom of shows on that list
<Buytoast> hell, there's probably people voting a helluva lotta times
<prince-dari> Most fans of other shows aren't ridiculous enough to do that
<DinkyDoo> BUTCHER WOMAN!
*potato_pony steals cuteness_kitteh's potato "Shhh everythings okay little guy"
<DinkyDoo> So much spices.
<Kululu> hello...
*cuteness_kitteh chews the bit she had on her spoon slowly, staring
<trixie_sprinkle> cowvarkian: this is the computer-graphics one, right?
<cowvarkian> trixie_sprinkle: yes
<cuteness_kitteh> Hai Kululu
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi Kululu
<DinkyDoo> A Cricket.
<DinkyDoo> Its a very pretty cricket at that.
<sub06905> lol
<trixie_sprinkle> cowvarkian: but its...they brought darth maul back as a cyborg...
<DinkyDoo> Why did I just say that....
<AssaultWithEmbraces> cricket
<[]DeadpoolDash> well time to update my bios
*cuteness_kitteh simply eats another potato ¬3¬
<Kululu> ku, ku, kuuu
<AJIsHaunter> If anything, I'd like them to make a new poll and only allow one vote per person. The fact that you're allowed to vote multiple times on one show or more is a huge fault in itself.
<thelonecubone> AJIsHaunter: i hope they do it soon
<thelonecubone> damn it
<thelonecubone> brb
<AJIsHaunter> thelonecubone: Agreed. Rigging votes for a show is NOT fair.
<trixie_sprinkle> prince-dari: im not so sure other shows' fans wouldnt do the same. if i werent a part of this fandom i wouldntve even heard of the poll, the regular fans that dont follow this stuff wouldnt even know about it most likely
<thelonecubone|ORC> there we go
<thelonecubone|ORC> "3
<thelonecubone|ORC> :3*
<AJIsHaunter> I don't mind people voting for their favorite show, but if they're rigging the poll by voting multiple times for that one show, then there's a problem.
*cuteness_kitteh chews her other potato menacingly
<Buytoast> shit i'd join a napping club
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: ikr
<Buytoast> napped all the time in high school
*potato_pony watches in horror
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Burning Love / Unsatisfied / Bad Day for Bonbon
<trixie_sprinkle> prince-dari: unless youre referring to the spam-voting, which i will agree, bronies probably do more than other shows' fans
<Buytoast> people thought i had some medical condition
*SlyTag burps
<cuteness_kitteh> potato_pony: Aren't you taking this a bit far? ¬_¬
<thelonecubone|ORC> Buytoast: same here

*cuteness_kitteh drops her fork in front of potato_pony "S-Sorry!"

<Shizuka> 13THIS IS PATRICK
<CriticKitten> Sumica: Actually it's sort of a lame story
<berberborscing> Should I open LAN on my Minecraft world so you'd all jump in? Wait, that'd suck
<trixie_sprinkle> wtf, why is everything on the new youtube layout so small
<Ponies47> And then sudden Shizu
<Dark92Enigma> i'm no Krusty Krab......
<Buytoast> the proper term
<Buytoast> is compact
<berberborscing> Lyra is fucking adorable.
<AJIsHaunter> Shizuka: WHAT? I thought this was the Pizza guy from Pizza castle! D:
<Shizuka> 13the proper term is mobile >>
*Dark92Enigma that's the name of the restaurant
<trixie_sprinkle> the proper term is crap
<VenHur> Well, I DON'T! Okay?! I can't seems to find the "Next Video" or "Previous Video" buttons! Not even "Autoplay"!
<Dark92Enigma> DAAAAAAAAAAAYUM!!!!!!!
<Shizuka> 13it's the mobile UI stretched to desktop size, done horribly
<BladedWings> Sumica: oh my
<KrazyNoobs> Whose OCs are these... and whats with Jasper giving out paddlin's?
*SlyTag continues ranting about the moderators from his air duct
<CriticKitten> Shizu is ALWAYS sudden. She's like a ninja or something, srsly. :|
<VenHur> What a load a bullshit Google had doned...
<KrazyNoobs> looking out the window... that's a paddlin'
<Sumica> 00,10why would I want my PC version of youtube to be mobile
<Buytoast> whatever UI is it, it's better named PUI
<Sumica> 00,10I have my vita for that
<AJIsHaunter> KrazyNoobs: Bronystate mods OCs, mostly.
<VenHur> They should feel bad and they SHOULD!
<Buytoast> because it stinks
<Sumica> 00,10and it looks cool too
<KrazyNoobs> AJisHaunter Oh, OK.
<Shizuka> 13also owing to the length of the film
<KrazyNoobs> But Jasper isn't a OC... is he?
<Shizuka> 13i will use full length intermission in the middle
<VenHur> *sigh* I think we better get used to it then...AGAIN...
<Dark92Enigma> MOBILE LAYOUTS: YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG, YOUTUBE
<berberborscing> lol
<KrazyNoobs> That's the picture you get whenever you "speak of ---"
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: and i can't send bulletins---wait, i already said that
<Afflict> looks like youtube got updated again
<Sumica> 00,10you can say it for now KrazyNoobs
<Sumica> 00,10it should die seeing as hub stoped showing them
<CriticKitten> Sumica: Then you obviously don't want Windows 8.
<CriticKitten> It's built for mobile platforms.
<berberborscing> I searched up "Talking Ben" and voice search thought i said "how give me a boner"
<Shizuka> 13also given the volume leveling on this movie, you'll probably want headphones
<Sumica> 00,10you are right i dont want it
<Sumica> 00,10it's suck and fail for games
<KrazyNoobs> Thanks, Sumica. Who here misses... *inhales dramatically* ... GAK! ... *me gusta*
<Vordox> THEY FINALLY UPDATED THE RELATED LINKS
<Vordox> FINALLY
<Shizuka> 13also that statistic is correct

<Sumica> 00,10oh well
<DanielBronies126> FAHKING HOURS VID :[:[:[:[:[
<Shizuka> 13it's weird, after swapping sources the video plays at half speed, even after switching back
<trixie_sprinkle> aw so close
<SpeccyRush> Shizuka: you said this was to long for BMN, and yet Enthiran is about as long and was played
<DanielBronies126> LOL
<Shizuka> 13gomplayer does it fine but it has too much UI
<Shizuka> 13SpeccyRush: not caring, playing now :P
<BladedWings> ok DanielBronies126 please stop being like that...either behave or leave
<Sumica> 00,10ewwww gom
<Shizuka> 13way too much ui on that one
<DanielBronies126> NO I NEED WATCH OME MLPS
<DanielBronies126> SOME*
<Buytoast> then leave and watch it
<Sumica> 00,10only use I had for GOm was playing anime that had the opening and endings as seprate files
<DanielBronies126> Kkk
<SpeccyRush> Shizuka: well that's better, actually will get to see it instead of hoping it'll get picked
<Buytoast> did he actually leave?
<CrystalPhoenix> Dat french music
<CriticKitten> ...
<Sketch_Tomba_Brony> 0_o
<Shizuka> 13okay so this guy says "herr kaleu", it's a shortening of "herr kapitanleutnant", captain lieutenant, the captain's full title
<Shizuka> 13that i know of, the captain is never actually named beyond that
<CrystalPhoenix> also I'm pretty sure most of you guys won't care about this but
<Stormy> Youtube is bugging me to use my real name
<Shizuka> 13they are in La Rochelle, France, occupied territory
<cowvarkian> fun
<Stormy> I get what they're trying to do, but it's kind of annoying
<CrystalPhoenix> This picture right here made my whole birthday http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mekxkglQSB1r6c0zro7_r1_1280.png
<Shizuka> 13also this guy just won an important medal, but even better
<Shizuka> 13he is actually drunk
<CriticKitten> "I was molested, captain." "HEY ME TOO, WE'RE BROS NOW." Methinks the captain doesn't get it. ._.
<Shizuka> 13he is actually doing this scene completely smashed
<Buytoast> really now?
<DanielBronies126> im playing BRICK FORCE
<GigabitHarmonie> No better acting than like the real thing.
<Sumica> 00,10Subs are kinda small
<weylin|Blarg> ...that man needs mad props...and more beer
<Shizuka> 13lag test, he just took the mic
<GigabitHarmonie> He's walking he just spoke.
<Sumica> 00,10no lag shizu
<CrystalPhoenix> he just spoke
<Shizuka> 13awsm
<DanielBronies126> hello
<DanielBronies126> aaaa
<Sumica> 00,10much better on subs
<DanielBronies126> aaaaaaaaa
<Shizuka> 13but also, he's the second actor for this part
<DanielBronies126> dddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
<Shizuka> 13the first actor was let go
<Shizuka> 13FOR BEING DRUNK TOO MUCH
<weylin|Blarg> lol
<Buytoast> damn
<Sketch_Tomba_Brony> :D
<Shizuka> 13as you'll see, while they're nazis, they don't much approve of the regime
<trixie_sprinkle> so inspirational!
<DanielBronies126> spam evepypony
<DanielBronies126> watch at fullscreen
<trixie_sprinkle> DanielBronies126: why
<NocturnalBlade> omg internet, why you so bad tonight :|
<Shizuka> 13the german navy was quite a bit more independent than the rest of the military, it was common for the commanders to talk smack about their superiors while out in the middle of nowhere waiting for orders
<weylin|Blarg> Those silly Nazis
<Buytoast> good for em
<Buytoast> not like Hitler's gonna take a row boat out to a submarine
<Shizuka> 13pretty much
<DanielBronies126> trixie_sprinkle you spam it if you watch at fullscreen
<weylin|Blarg> Presents a whole new side of the war, this does
<cowvarkian> just drunk soldiers, eh
<Shizuka> 13this being the directors cut there's some more character development and longer scenes than the theatrical version
*LadyCanary facedesks.
<DanielBronies126> ASS
<Shizuka> 13i'll pass on some of the other fun tidbits from commentary as we go on :)
<Shizuka> 13this is all one shot
<Buytoast> ha
<weylin|Blarg> yay~
<Shizuka> 13it cuts on the closeup of the bullets there
<DanielBronies126> LOL
<DanielBronies126> FAIL
<Shizuka> 13otherwise one continuous shot
<Sumica> 00,10nice shots
<SpeccyRush> Shizuka: explains somewhat how Karl Donitz became hitlers succesor
<DanielBronies126> NICE SHOT MAN XD
<Shizuka> 13thomsen's actor drunk again
<Afflict> yeah I know
<Shizuka> 13gratuitous english!
<DanielBronies126> trixie What is Das Boot
<Shizuka> 13okay so fun fact, they have only one submarine
<Shizuka> 13so there's hidden cuts all over this sequence to hide the fact that it's the same model
<DanielBronies126> Shizuka
<trixie_sprinkle> DanielBronies126: the boat i think
<CriticKitten> Huh, clever.
<DanielBronies126> Boat???
<Shizuka> 13now, maybe you'll recognize it
<CriticKitten> Didn't catch them either.
<Shizuka> 13a fun story from the production of this movie
<trixie_sprinkle> yes DanielBronies126 ,i just checked, it is
<Shizuka> 13when they came back to la rochelle to film these last shots, they found their main model was missing!
<Randomnerd> "Unterwasserboot", yes?
<DaringDerpy> I recommend the book. The movie can't impart the same tension.
<DanielBronies126> So what?... cinema was an war?
<Shizuka> 13some yahoo american director had borrowed it for some film about a guy in a fedora uncovering the ark of the covenant
<DaringDerpy> unterseeboot
<Shizuka> 13yes, the submarine in raiders of the lost ark is das boot's... boat
<SpeccyRush> lel
<SkunkTauri> back, from very long afk :'(
<weylin|Blarg> That silly American director
<Randomnerd> "untersee". Should have known.
<CriticKitten> Ha, that's awesome
<Buytoast> didn't that movie have nazis too?
<Shizuka> 13X3
<weylin|Blarg> Conspiracy~
<DanielBronies126> NAZI IS COMING
<DanielBronies126> XD
<Randomnerd> We won the war, we get to keep it :P
<Shizuka> 13nah spielberg gave it back
<Shizuka> 13but there was like a hairline fracture in the front third
<DanielBronies126> THOMPSON GUN?
<cowvarkian> <.< narwal?
<DanielBronies126> LULZ
<Shizuka> 13there's a shot coming later of the boat going out to sea, like thirty seconds after that cuts out, the boat started to collapse
<SpeccyRush> Shizuka: drive like you stole it
<DaringDerpy> we will win the next one :P
<Sumica> 00,10must be realy hard to use taht deck gun in sub combat
<SkunkTauri> what is this about?
<cowvarkian> SkunkTauri: unicrons
<Sumica> 00,10hope they give the guy a air hose
<Buytoast> nah, just hold your breath and fire the gun
<CriticKitten> Sumica: Not hard for Aquaman
<cowvarkian> aquaman is best nazi
<Shizuka> 13i'm thinking if you're on the surface and have to defend yourself with those guns
<Shizuka> 13you're pretty much screwed
<SkunkTauri> cowvarkian: unicrons XP
<DanielBronies126> XD
<SkunkTauri> huh?
<CriticKitten> Well, yeah.
<Shizuka> 13especially seeing how badly they fare with basic combat as this movie goes on
<DaringDerpy> torpedoes are limited. the deck gun is usually directed to the rear. for escape
<Shizuka> 13now this is also one continuous shot
<Randomnerd> Sumica: THey'll talk about the depth these coffins operate at later.
<Shizuka> 13the set does not come apart, the camera has to move in among the crew just like the actors
<Buytoast> some pretty cramped quarters
<CriticKitten> A sub's one big advantage is its underwater status, stealth and evasion. On the surface you're basically a sitting duck for heavy artillery rounds.
<SkunkTauri> i was afk so long because i have a new puppy to watch XD
<Shizuka> 13it's mounted on gimbals, so later as depth charges hit, the set really is shaking that much
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I've been inside a submarine before on a field trip during my second year of NJROTC
<Shizuka> 13but also, the stabilizer for the camera was so loud, all the submarine scenes are dubbed
<Sumica> 00,10so um, should not all that gear have been stored and sortted before they left port?
<Randomnerd> -And British sailors who've had enough of your shenanigans...
<Buytoast> is there a scene where they say "Splashes" or something like that Shizuka?
<Shizuka> 13i guess it would take them so long to get to combat heavy waters they have plenty of time
<cowvarkian> Sumica: that would make sense though
<AssaultWithEmbraces> They are cramped and you have to almost press up on the ladders to climb up and down
<AssaultWithEmbraces> or else you'll bump your head
<CriticKitten> I've visited a few ships, I could never live in such tight corridors. Those things make me feel claustrophobic.
<SkunkTauri> i have never been on a submarine before
<Shizuka> 13so this is the indiana jones version of the sub models
<Rose`Vased> das boot?
<Shizuka> 13before he made off with it :3
<Buytoast> i've been on one
<Randomnerd> They're interesting, SkunkTauri
<Buytoast> spent the night in it
<Rose`Vased> im kay with this\
<Buytoast> smelled funny
<SkunkTauri> looks really cramped
<DanielBronies126> Loading Completed
<AssaultWithEmbraces> They are cramped
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Gotta move to the side and all
<Shizuka> 13SkunkTauri: the camera makes it look bigger than it is, just think about that
<DanielBronies126> Brick Force Load Completed
<Shizuka> 13the set is absolutely identical to the real VIIC boats
<Rose`Vased> speaking of cramps, combatives is painful.
<DanielBronies126> GTG im playing Brick Force
<Randomnerd> This is my only problem with this movie.
<DaringDerpy> the subs could be better.
<Shizuka> 13so yeah claustrophobics need not apply
<Randomnerd> The U-Boats were NOT crewed by boys.
<CriticKitten> Yeah, the passageways in a sub are really tight. Cut down for efficiency's sake, but downright terrifying if you hate tight spaces
<Randomnerd> Not this early, anyway.
<Shizuka> 13Randomnerd: no but 18-24 isn't exactly battle hardened belonging in the tense combat of subs
<Rose`Vased> a boat under water, seculded from prying eyes, full of men for long periods of time
<Rose`Vased> they must have been bored ;#
<cowvarkian> Rose`Vased: I see what you're insinuating there...
<Shizuka> 13more inaccurate is how these guys celebrate during combats, they were in way too much danger to do that IRL
<SkunkTauri> im not claustrophobic, but staying in a submarine will definantly change that
<Rose`Vased> some sub men work for year long shifts
<Shizuka> 13subs in this era used diesel engines that needed to vent every 10-12 ish hours of diving
<Shizuka> 13course we use nuclear subs that can stay down for months to a year or more at a time
<cowvarkian> ikr
<SpeccyRush> not to mention the food would eventually aquire a taste of diesel Shizuka
<SkunkTauri> Shizuka: but, you also have to worry about radiation leakage too
<CriticKitten> Yuck.
<Shizuka> 13ALAAAAAARM
<Buytoast> uh oh
<DaringDerpy> they're slow underwater...most of the time they are above surface
<Rose`Vased> tasty tasty diesel food
<CriticKitten> Dat ass
<cowvarkian> SkunkTauri: thats what the engineers need to worry about
<Shizuka> 13again, the set is one thing
<AdamTheDuck> o.O
<Shizuka> 13the camera is rushing through there with the rest of them
<Sumica> 00,10human balist
<Shizuka> 13the cameraman had to wear like full body padding :P
<Shizuka> 13that's their smaller model diving
<weylin|Blarg> Poor camraman :(
<weylin|Blarg> camea
<Shizuka> 13there's room for one stuntman to pilot it
<weylin|Blarg> camera
<Buytoast> man, just seeing that one iron strut hanging there
<Buytoast> would make me nervous running in those quarters
<GigabitHarmonie> I know it's redundant, but I simply adore you for this Shizuka.
<Sumica> 00,10good thing current subs have better dive plains
<Randomnerd> The Skipper is also Duke Leto Atreides in Dune.
<Shizuka> 13<3
<J_E_Smith71> That fello
<J_E_Smith71> That guy's voice sounded creepy
<Shizuka> 13by the end of this movie, you will all know that "tiefer" means "deeper"
<CriticKitten> Sumica: Yeah, they finally build them so there's no more snakes on them.
<GigabitHarmonie> This was a childhood movie for me. XD <3
<Randomnerd> Yeah... "Deeper" comes up a lot in this movie.
<trixie_sprinkle> they must go deeper
<trixie_sprinkle> ...i had to do it
<cowvarkian> learning german with Das Boot
<Shizuka> 13aw don't freak out the poor war correspondent
<Shizuka> 13cowvarkian: actually that's how i first saw this movie, we watched the six hour TV format version in german class :P
<Buytoast> go to 260
<cowvarkian> huh
<Buytoast> throw caution to the sea
<Shizuka> 13sub is hungry
<DaringDerpy> the subs are just bad. they don't translate half of the implications. from the words they translate at all. whole sentences are left out.
<Shizuka> 13i think the subtitles are geared slightly more towards the english audio
<cowvarkian> I voted on the english version...
<jcelios> oh cool dis das boot?
<trixie_sprinkle> yup
<cowvarkian> no, its my little pony the musical
<Shizuka> 13nope it's sailor moon super happy time
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: If the sub is hungry, then feed it a sub sandwhich:p
<jcelios> which version
<weylin|Blarg> ja
<Shizuka> 13J_E_Smith71: IN NAZI GERMANY SUB EAT YOU !!
<Buytoast> i could go for a sub
<Shizuka> 13jcelios: directors cut, 3.5 hour
<Buytoast> and a burger
<Shizuka> 131997 directors cut specifically i think
<Saturn> 08,01did somebody say draco malfoy?
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: and some other american foods
<jcelios> I heard there are cuts of this movie that go on for an ungodly amount of time because it was going to be a mini series or something
<cowvarkian> Saturn: no?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Saturn, not that I know of
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Buytoast> now that you mention it, fries and a coke wouldn't be too bad
<Buytoast> and mozzerlla sticks
<Shizuka> 13"the original uncut edition" i think is the six hour tv format they shot it for
<DanielBronies126> SHIZUKA!!!!!!!!!!!
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: and heart attack on a bun?
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: I thought it was Russia where the subs eat you
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Buytoast: Mmmm sounds delicious. I'm jelly
<Buytoast> psh, we all die some day
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: some sooner then others
<DaringDerpy> too old
<DanielBronies126> hizuka
<weylin|Blarg> Russia didn't have subs then...did they?
<DanielBronies126> shizuka
<Shizuka> 13wat
<Shizuka> 13weylin|Blarg: no you had to translate the audio by ear :P
<DanielBronies126> can i watch mlp server plz?
<Buytoast> welp
<J_E_Smith71> ...maybe I should have just left the joke there
<Shizuka> 13DanielBronies126: wat
<Shizuka> 13we are watching movie
<Shizuka> 13awsm movie
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<DanielBronies126> Mlp Brony erver plz
<CriticKitten> Aye
<J_E_Smith71> DanielBronies126: MLP plays tomorrow, and Saturday
<Sumica> 00,10did some one ask for ponies?
<cowvarkian> dis is srs bsnz DanielBronies126
<DanielBronies126> Idit Movie
*DaringDerpy wants more ponies
<LadyCanary> Kick.
<LadyCanary> Now.
<Buytoast> what now
<DanielBronies126> idiot movie
<DaringDerpy> but after the movie
<weylin|Blarg> Shizuka: I was talking about submarines :P
<Buytoast> are you mocking german?
<Shizuka> 13the first watch officer there is pretty much the only ardent nazi on the boat
<jcelios> its called Germans in a sub for three hours AND YOU VILL VATCH IT
<Buytoast> that's as bad as mocking Uncle Sam's home
<LadyCanary> DanielBronies126: Then go watch somewhere else. SImple as that.
<LadyCanary> No need to bring your whiny ass here.
<Shizuka> 13canary canary <3
<DanielBronies126> ???
<DanielBronies126> LOL FAT BOY
<Buytoast> i swear
<DaringDerpy> 120% loyal
<LadyCanary> I apologize Shizu. But I am not in the mood for idiocy tonight .-.
<Shizuka> 13:P
<Shizuka> 13canary gots teeth :3
<LadyCanary> I can. When provoked.
<Shizuka> 13yes the captain is pretty much openly mocking hitler and the nazis, this stuff happened
<weylin|Blarg> And people thought all Germans were for the Nazi party
<Buytoast> Hitler Youth group?
<Shizuka> 13because the 1WO is the only hardline nazi on the boat
<AssaultWithEmbraces> OH MY GOD
<Buytoast> "N-A-Z-I, OUR FURHER IS PRETTY FLY!"
<Sumica> 00,10good song
<jcelios> yeah like Boy Scouts but they brainwash them into nazis
<Shizuka> 13over the course of the film he'll be the only one to keep his uniform in order and shave
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Why am I feeling like I've seen this before?
<CriticKitten> And then musical number
<CriticKitten> :D
<Shizuka> 13there
<trixie_sprinkle> why o i get a disney ibe from this
<Shizuka> 13that shot with the guys on the deck
<DaringDerpy> and he's not even from germany. tries to be more german than the germans.
<trixie_sprinkle> *vibe
<Shizuka> 13like thirty seconds after the cut, the boat broke apart
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I don't think I have but I think I did.
<Shizuka> 13THANKS SPIELBERG
<trixie_sprinkle> U JERK
<Saturn> 08,01DAS BOOT
<CriticKitten> THANKS OBAMA. ....wait.
<Saturn> 08,01SHIZU <3
<Shizuka> 13:3
<weylin|Blarg> FUCK YOU, SPIELBERG! YOU RUINED OUR BOAT!
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: >.>
<Buytoast> that's what happens when you deal with a passionate MURIKAN
<Saturn> 08,01weylin|Blarg: it's called a boot
<CriticKitten> Buytoast: A MURIKAN from MURIKA?
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: have you read the book on which this is based?
<Shizuka> 13it's "das boot", with the o pronounced long like you're from minnesooooota
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: what other kind
<weylin|Blarg> verzeih mir, Saturn :(
<DaringDerpy> he's the only one with a north german dialect
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: doncha know
<Shizuka> 13Saturn: no i was trying to find a ebook version but pirate bay is lousy for kindles... demonoid was better <<
<CriticKitten> cowvarkian: The kind that comes from Texas. :D
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: well that works too
<Sumica> 00,10damn fly
<DaringDerpy> all our sailors are from northern germany
<Shizuka> 13real enigma machine there
<Buytoast> that guy is pretty fly
<jcelios> coo
<Shizuka> 13i forget who loaned it to them for the production
<CriticKitten> Dat fly
<AssaultWithEmbraces> booo, Buytoast
<Buytoast> don't blame me, blame visual puns
<Saturn> 08,01weylin|Blarg: kein problem
<Sumica> 00,10pretty fly for a rabi?
<Shizuka> 13pretty fly for a .... na... zi?
<CriticKitten> Imagine how much it's gonna smell in there after a few weeks.
<weylin|Blarg> ;v;
<DaringDerpy> our technology museum has one. it's still working perfectly, Sumica
<CriticKitten> Much less months.
<cowvarkian> a priest a rabi, and a horse walk into a bar....
<DaringDerpy> Shizuka:
<DaringDerpy> so
<Cypresswolf> pretty fly for a sub guy
<Sumica> 00,10Hmmmmm Subway
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi SpeccyRush
<Saturn> 08,01aber ich denke sie es gelesen
<Shizuka> 13this is the kind of boredom they would have between combats
<SpeccyRush> AssaultWithEmbraces: was here the whole time :P
<Buytoast> i almost can make that out Saturn
<Shizuka> 13you'll notice in every sub shot there's a little haze around lights and such
<Buytoast> almost
<jcelios> don't they have the internet? jeez
<Sumica> 00,10they need an ecxbax
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: i should show Dark Star at some point
<AssaultWithEmbraces> SpeccyRush, really? You didn't talk much
<Shizuka> 13director petersen had the walls sprayed down so that haze would hang around
<Shizuka> 13give the sense of the heat and stench of the sub
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: I always see a little haz around lights and stuff
<cowvarkian> *haze
<Buytoast> wait a second
<CriticKitten> Nice.
<Buytoast> did they have showers?
<Buytoast> they didn't im guessing
<SpeccyRush> AssaultWithEmbraces: never do,
<Sumica> 00,10no Buytoast
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Buytoast: nope
<Buytoast> oh man
<Saturn> 08,01what's showers, precious?
<Sumica> 00,10they just roll down the windows
<CriticKitten> Showers are for quitters
<weylin|Blarg> lol
<cowvarkian> haha, windows
<weylin|Blarg> real men don't need showers
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: pff that's about as funny as a screen door on a battleship :P
<AssaultWithEmbraces> So yep, people in the water for long periods of time, all stink and covered in man sweats
<Sumica> 00,10atomic hand grenades
<Sumica> 00,10ejector seats on choppers
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: ever played Paranoia?
<Sumica> 00,10nope
<ShadowQuill> My OC is now a mare
<Saturn> 08,01Paranoia has thermonuclear handgrenades
<Shizuka> 13the sub is shot chronologically, so for the most part their beards are real
<Shizuka> 13SATURN
<Shizuka> 13THAT IS ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE INFORMATION
<Shizuka> 13THEY AREN'T ALLOWED TO KNOW
<DaringDerpy> these things are huge
<Sumica> 00,10ewwwwww
<Buytoast> goddamn the stench must be horrific
<CriticKitten> ....Saturn's a commie traitor?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> eww
<cowvarkian> duh
<AssaultWithEmbraces> That grease?
<Shizuka> 13WER WAR DAS
<CrystalPhoenix> oh hai Saturn
<Sumica> 00,10he gonna cry?
<DaringDerpy> haha
<jcelios> :_(
<Shizuka> 13oh this is far from the worst thing that'll happen to the guy this movie
<DaringDerpy> romantic
<PonyWatchesYou> how do you see the clearance marking if it's ultraviolet... wait, that's the point, right?
*Saturn 08,01forgets that most in here are infrared clearence
<weylin|Blarg> poor guy :c
<DaringDerpy> weylin|Blarg: he deserved it
<cowvarkian> Saturn: >.>
<Shizuka> 13fun is mandatory
<CriticKitten> Oh, right, we should crack out our Yellow Submarine references for this movie.
<Shizuka> 13the computer is your friend
<cowvarkian> mandatory fun is worst fun
<Shizuka> 13weeeee're all living in a nazi submarine
<DaringDerpy> he's the overeager idiot in the group who makes nothing than trouble
<weylin|Blarg> wrong chat, my bad DaringDerpy ^^;
<DaringDerpy> oh ^^
<jcelios> letters? he should brought his laptop
<Buytoast> what's he gonna do, send the litter out in a bottle?
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: I imagine that going to ridicuoulsly upbeat music and dancing
<cowvarkian> *ridiculously
<Starlight_Phoenix> is this u571?
<Saturn> 08,01is there a rifftrax for this?
<weylin|Blarg> ^
<Shizuka> 13don't think so
<Shizuka> 13you could look :P
<CriticKitten> Oh shit
<Sumica> 00,10doubt it
<Randomnerd> This isn't high-profile enough for it.
<Randomnerd> Rifftrax riffs on Blockbusters.
<Shizuka> 13well they do smaller things too like shorts
<cowvarkian> Randomnerd: thats funny.
<Shizuka> 13but ja das boot might be out of their range, would have been more relevant during MST3K, but they did bad movies then
<Saturn> 08,01pppppppppppp
<Randomnerd> cowvarkian: This movie was a big deal, but who in the English speaking world watched it?
<Shizuka> 13you can see the dubbing at work there
<AssaultWithEmbraces> pi
<Randomnerd> Americans hate Foreign Cinema
<cowvarkian> Randomnerd: theirs an english version
<Shizuka> 13Randomnerd: it got big over here too
<cowvarkian> Randomnerd: I like foreign movies...
<Shizuka> 13all the actors spoke fluent english so the english version is still them
<Randomnerd> And the British basically would react to the movie with "Well, they had it coming"
*Saturn 08,01can just about understand about 50% of the dialogue
<Shizuka> 13even though it was marketed as "the boat" everyone knows it as das boot
<Saturn> 08,01the book was called U-Boat
<Shizuka> 13if the subs were german i could probably keep up, conversation speed spoken german tends to blur past me though
<Buytoast> you'd think they'd at least shave their heads or something so the grease don't bug em
<CriticKitten> ....
<AssaultWithEmbraces> what is he doing?
<Randomnerd> This is not a blockbuster.
<Shizuka> 13lemon with milk i think
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Is that sour milk?
<Saturn> 08,01hey shizu, fancy spending a few months in germany with me next summer?
<Randomnerd> (Condensed milk)
<SpeccyRush> Shizuka: why do I get the feeling that guy will be sick at some point
<Cypresswolf> ....even if milk is from a can, I'm sure its a bad sign when you have to chew it O_o
<Randomnerd> What shorts did Rifftrax do?
<Shizuka> 13i know they did one got fat
<Shizuka> 13there's a few others, public domain shorts
<Saturn> 08,01also, i discored the other day that for about €200, you can get a europe-wide train ticket, valid for a month
<Saturn> 08,01unlimited travel on the mainland
<DaringDerpy> where, Saturn ?
*AdamTheDuck licks Ruggy :3
<Randomnerd> Shizuka: Yeah, I loved the shorts on MST3K. "Why don't they look?"
<SpeccyRush> Shizuka: will we see some wolf pack moments?
<cowvarkian> wow... team fourstar riffs dragonball evolution
<RDash5000> hello :)
<DanielBronies126> Black screen?
<weylin|Blarg> RDash5000 hello :)
<Cypresswolf> Saturn: That's good to know, if I ever I decide to tour Europe like my brother did, I'll have to keep that in mind
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai RDash5000
<Shizuka> 13so the long shots of the boat in the water
<DanielBronies126> BS?
<Shizuka> 13you can tell it's not actually humans up there
<Cypresswolf> Saturn: he rode the tran from London to Rome and back again with some collece friends a few years ago
<Shizuka> 13the crew are basically barbie dolls
<DanielBronies126> B SCREEN?
<Randomnerd> Funfact: Admiral Doenitz was the last ruler of the Third Reich.
<Saturn> 08,01okay, just looked it up; the person who told me about it was looking at the wrong thing
<Saturn> 08,01it's €600 for a month
<DaringDerpy> in this case, flying might be cheaper, Saturn
<DanielBronies126> Lag vid?
<DaringDerpy> still good for a month
<Saturn> 08,01or maybe i'm looking in the wrong place...
<RDash5000> http://simgretina.bandcamp.com/album/ponibot
<Cypresswolf> about 800 in dollar amount....pricey, but that would make for a great vacation....now all I need is for my boss to approve a 1 month vacation :D
<Buytoast> is that...
<AdamTheDuck> RDash5000, no non-image links during streams please.
<Buytoast> A FORBIDDEN LNIK?
<DaringDerpy> hi RDash5000
<RDash5000> woops
<SpeccyRush> Buytoast: yes
<Saturn> 08,01http://www.interrailnet.com/interrail-passes/interrail-global-pass
<jcelios> OFF WITH HIS HEAD
<DaringDerpy> thx for the link :)
<Saturn> 08,01if you're under £25, it's waaaay cheaper
<Saturn> 08,01£273 for 22 continuous days
<RDash5000> DaringDerpy: no prob, but its not happening again :$
<DaringDerpy> rules and stuff
<Shizuka> 13i love you hydrophone guy
<jcelios> ring ring ring ring hydrophone...
<Randomnerd> He looks like a young Liam Neesan.
<Randomnerd> Neeson.
<Cypresswolf> Saturn: can you ride the train from london north to Scotland?
<Shizuka> 13ha he does
<RDash5000> did somepony say, LIAM NEESON?!
<Randomnerd> High Spirits is a good movie....
<Randomnerd> That has a young Liam Neeson in it.
<Shizuka> 13what's that mister engine? kill them all?
<jcelios> testing
<jcelios> hmm
<Buytoast> must be giving him subliminal messages
<DaringDerpy> they call him "the ghost"
<DaringDerpy> can't see shit
<DaringDerpy> now the fun begins
<Randomnerd> They translated "Scheisse" as "Oh, no!"?
<Shizuka> 13ikr
<Kimori_NapTime> Couldnt you just make one up
<jcelios> lol
<Shizuka> 13i think the english is much cleaner
<RDash5000> liam neeson: trained batman, AND Darth Vader. He is both Aslan, and Zeus, making him a god in at least TWO religions, AND he punches wolves. WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU TRY TO KIDNAP HIS FAMILY?
<DaringDerpy> it is
<jcelios> I read "He is both asian as zeus"
<Sumica> 00,10......
<Sumica> 00,10they wisper
<Shizuka> 13because sonar
<DaringDerpy> sonar
<Sumica> 00,10then stomp around and knock shit over
<CriticKitten> So the destroyer doesn't hear them.
<CriticKitten> *nod*
<DaringDerpy> I wonder how it works with the alarm bell
<Shizuka> 13magic
<Shizuka> 13might also be to have a sense of calm
<Buytoast> boats are very skitterish creatures
<Buytoast> you must whisper when approaching them
<Buytoast> else scare them away
<weylin|Blarg> They're huntin
<RDash5000> submarines a cool. but living in one for several weeks? no thank you
<Buytoast> several weeks?
<Sumica> 00,10uhhhh
<DaringDerpy> that's what robots are for
<Shizuka> 13dropping the lights lets their electrical system work better
<Sumica> 00,10why dim lights
<Randomnerd> The Destroyer has ASDIC.
<cowvarkian> Saturn: mfw only european residents can use a global pass
<Sumica> 00,10ahh
<cowvarkian> *interrail pass
<DaringDerpy> european master race
<Randomnerd> It might not have a Hydrophone, but it has an early form of sonar.
<Shizuka> 13this shot was apparently a bit hazardous to get a model that close to a camera in water
<DaringDerpy> oopsie
<RDash5000> SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT
<Shizuka> 13the british destroyers did have sonar though
<Buytoast> uh oh
<Shizuka> 13the set really is shaking this much too
<CriticKitten> Oshit
<DaringDerpy> so far a total failure
<Saturn> 08,01cowvarkian: aw
<DaringDerpy> the weather makes it easy to escape
<Randomnerd> Yeah, ASDIC. The British overplayed its accuracy, for obvious reasons.
<Shizuka> 13DaringDerpy: not entirely, they could get away using full engines but would make them easy to track
<cowvarkian> like in star trek
<Randomnerd> I'm not sure if His Majesty's Navy has hedgehogs yet.
<Shizuka> 13thus why hydrophone guy has to keep track of where they are, you pretty much have to sneak away from destroyers
<RDash5000> so fucking SNEAKY!
<CriticKitten> Bet the Nazis wish they were Reptile right now.
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Shizuka> 13this is also a bit psychological against the crew, the captain is making sure the crew don't think he's scared or anything
<Shizuka> 13captain is in control, even if he isn't
<RDash5000> reptile the invisiblessed
<Sumica> 00,10lol for a second I thought hydrophone guy said left full rudder
<Sumica> 00,10was gonna say damn how can he tell
<cowvarkian> he's a wizard
<Shizuka> 13shshshshshshshshshshshsh
<DaringDerpy> I were a bad captain. My left eye twitches when I'm stressed too much.
<Randomnerd> That's true in any Navy -just as they get to speak more freely, they have no authority higher than the Skipper.
*RDash5000 plays jaws music
<Shizuka> 13just look how much that's shaking
<RDash5000> that was OBVIOUSLY a tiny model
<CriticKitten> ._.
<Shizuka> 13crew's expression of fear is pretty genuine
<cowvarkian> whenever someone says skipper, I always think of gilligans island
<RDash5000> ^
<Buytoast> shake shake shake
<Shizuka> 13the explosion shots are 1500fps shots of small explosions in the tank
<Sumica> 00,10See the world they said
<Randomnerd> Peace Treaties used to have provisions excusing acts of war committed after the end of hostilities, on the grounds many ships would not get word for months.
<Sumica> 00,10join the navy they said
<Shizuka> 13the model is like 3 meters they said? i think
<Shizuka> 13meet interesting people then bomb them
<cowvarkian> they said
<RDash5000> :D
<RDash5000> i fucking love you guys.
<cowvarkian> I know
<weylin|Blarg> It'll be for the Motherland, they said
<Shizuka> 13oh and like i said earlier, probably best to have headphones for this movie, the quiets are very quiet and the louds are very loud
<Randomnerd> RIP Headphone Users.
*DaringDerpy has headphones
<Shizuka> 13it's not like a huge jump
<RDash5000> waaaaaay ahead of you shizu :)
<Shizuka> 13but it lets you hear the quiet stuff without having speakers up too high for the more bassy explosions
<Sumica> 00,10um would they not pick up the creaking?
<DaringDerpy> true
<Shizuka> 13probably why he's saying to go deeper
<Shizuka> 13mask the sound with more water
<SpeccyRush> Shizuka: full volume all the way and not afraid of anything, I have spare speakers anyway
<cowvarkian> We must go deeper
<Randomnerd> Sumica: Ambient noise, could be their own ship.
<Shizuka> 13that too
<DaringDerpy> play dead..."we sink, go away, destroyer!"
<jcelios> go DEEPER? *inception sound*
<RDash5000> ^

<DaringDerpy> oh shit
<CriticKitten> They're in deep shit now.
<pony_26> o hai is it movie night already
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hm
<CriticKitten> If the hull is cracked enough for water to leak in, they're in real trouble.
<DaringDerpy> not yet
<Shizuka> 13nope, shizu special :)
<trixie_sprinkle> no pony_26 , just watching a movie
<weylin|Blarg> and an awesome movie so far
<DaringDerpy> hull fixed
<aniderp|bestcakeever> what movie?
<Shizuka> 13150 meters underwater
<Shizuka> 13destroyer still knows exactly where they are
<RDash5000> ^
<DaringDerpy> they were at full speed
<weylin|Blarg> Das Boot, aniderp|bestcakeever
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ok
<Shizuka> 13captain has a habit of talking to the opposing team
<Randomnerd> What's also important is you never see anyone else.
<Randomnerd> You don't see the "Tommies".
<Randomnerd> Did they cut out the part where they leave the sailors to die?
<Shizuka> 13yeah modern movies would cut away to the brits looking for the sub or something
<Shizuka> 13Randomnerd: nope that's in
<Shizuka> 13this has more than the theatrical version, but mostly character development stuff
<JRP2234> lalalalla
<DaringDerpy> it would ruin the atmosphere to show the others
<Shizuka> 13he's counting depth charges, destroyer ran out of ammo
<Shizuka> 13yay we didn't die this time!
<RDash5000> we should all wish Ponies47 a happy birthday :)
<DaringDerpy> the destroyer attacked another sub before. how can he know how many depth charges are left?
<sub06905|Gta_4> we did :P
<Shizuka> 13not so much knowing how much is left
<RDash5000> lol
<RDash5000> cuz i just did
<cowvarkian> just how much isn't there?
<Shizuka> 13but if they drop like 25 charges looking for one sub
<Shizuka> 13they're probably going to walk away eventually
<Shizuka> 13like they did
<DaringDerpy> hm...
<jcelios> is that guy ever off his hydrophone :P
<DaringDerpy> he is married to it
<aniderp|bestcakeever> dat jaymoo up?
<Shizuka> 13maybe a backup at best but probably only to sleep
<Shizuka> 13i think we're coming up on the halfway mark i'll intermission at
<DaringDerpy> hydrophones should be built redundant...at least three of them, with operators
<jcelios> space and man power
<Shizuka> 13^
<DaringDerpy> if it fails, they are blind
<Shizuka> 13u-boats were surface boats that could go underwater
<Shizuka> 13not really the other way around
<jcelios> its a combustion engine sub, its a miracle it even works lol
<DaringDerpy> they have to resurface to take fresh air quite often
<DaringDerpy> compressed air tanks
<jcelios> o dear....
<Shizuka> 13i think the thing i read said the VIICs were limited to 10-12 hours underwater at the very best
<RDash5000> :D
*AdamTheDuck dances :$
<DaringDerpy> lol
<AssaultWithEmbraces> uh

<Dark92Enigma> WELL WELL, Banzai, what do we have here?
<DaringDerpy> the translation could be more precise ^^
<jcelios> "hag"
<Shizuka> 13like i said i think the subs are more geared towards the english audio
<RDash5000> you got the floor wet...
<Dark92Enigma> I dunno Shenzi, whaddya say Ed?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> jaymoo? ;_;
<Polydunami> I was watching Youtube videos when the design was suddenly changed
*Dark92Enigma laughs
<DaringDerpy> he didn't say hag, she said matress
<Randomnerd> That's some stiff-upper-lip bull right there.
<Randomnerd> Keep in mind, these things are very large coffins.
<RDash5000> ^
<Polydunami> One small malfunction and everyone dies, huh?
<Shizuka> 13pretty much
<jcelios> its running windows ME also
<Randomnerd> lol jcelios
<Shizuka> 13the blue lighting is probably also good for simulating night, plus the engines being able to recharge the electrical system
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: it doesn't help that all of them have two days until retirement.....
<DaringDerpy> when too deep, it just makes *pop* and the hull folds together :)
<Shizuka> 13Dark92Enigma: and they keep showing pictures of family to each other
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: (cue world's smallest violin playing ''Woe It's Me''
<Dark92Enigma> )
<Polydunami> I missed the first hour of the movie, unfortunately :S
<RDash5000> so did i
<trixie_sprinkle> how do they get rid off all the water that gets in?
<Shizuka> 13probably pumped

<DaringDerpy> ded
<Shizuka> 13director petersen didn't realize how it happened so he wanted a second take
<TheGentleManBrony> and Shizuka we're in the same time zone, my fellow Minnesotan :)
<weylin|Blarg> And they say acting is a 'soft' job :T
<Shizuka> 13the movie was quickly rewritten to put the guy in bed for the rest of the voyage
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: and he broke---oh wait that's legit :O
<RDash5000> German actors are best actors
<TheGentleManBrony> Soo...this is Das Boot right?
<Shizuka> 13enforced method acting all over the place in this movie
<Polydunami> See the title at the bottom?
<Dark92Enigma> TheGentleManBrony: yes
<TheGentleManBrony> Oh yeah.
<TheGentleManBrony> Sorry.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Okay, all that water that comes splashing down will eventually smell and cause some rotting, even if it were pumped and drained
<weylin|Blarg> Germany: Stuntmen? We don't need no stinkin' stuntmen!
<TheGentleManBrony> I'm still kinda high.

<Polydunami> Gak is dead.
<Kandarihu> Uh, is there someone here who has a Steam accounte named Sonico.?
<CrystalPhoenix> but I loved that kick
<HoodyEvee> RIP gak
<LadyCanary> OMG MUFFINS SHIZU.
<LadyCanary> Shizu the muffin queen :3
<trixie_sprinkle> gak will never die!
<RDash5000> Shizuka: let the feasting commence!
<Polydunami> Shizuka, did Luna steal a muffin?
<weylin|Blarg> Muffins, omnomnom
<Dark92Enigma> Mmmmmmm Muffins!
<Sumica> 00,10dead weight to the front
<HoodyEvee> Is this battle ship 1945?
<DaringDerpy> soon, the age of gak will come
<SpeccyRush> Ermaserlertier Merffins
<Dark92Enigma> HoodyEvee: DAS BOOT
<HoodyEvee> Dark92Enigma: :I
<Dark92Enigma> HoodyEvee: one of the best movies in existance, period
<RDash5000> man, now i want muffins...
<Afflict> Something I've wondering for a while. That purple stuff that dark spyro breathes is called convexity, but I've never heard it mentioned in the games, unless it's mentioned at the end of DoTD. Where did that name come from?
<HoodyEvee> Choking sound?
<J_E_Smith71> Speaking of Hub commericals, next time those creepy CGI Chuck E Cheese ads come up, just remember that Chuck shows pony clips at his place so it goes both ways: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=400294253381040&set=o.228152417266041&type=1&relevant_count=1&ref=nf
<RDash5000> that noise
<AlienWarhead> DaringDerpy: No the age of Smooze is upon us
<Dark92Enigma> HoodyEvee: just saying......don't compare this <--- to Battleship
<Afflict> Unless it was mentioned in the games and I just missed it
<Dark92Enigma> :)
<DaringDerpy> praise smooze!
<HoodyEvee> Gak was smooze in disguise
<HoodyEvee> Dark92Enigma: I twas joking
<Sumica> 00,10and now you die
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Shizuka: Them muffins :3
<DaringDerpy> smooze and gak will fight the battle that ends all battles
<Dark92Enigma> HoodyEvee: sorry, couldn't tell :D
<DaringDerpy> sounds bad
<Dark92Enigma> DaringDerpy: MEGA GAK VS GIANT SMOOZE
<DaringDerpy> no screams?
*Dark92Enigma slaps himself for the bad joke
*DaringDerpy needs more screams
<Shizuka> 13metal screeches are louder than humans
<Dark92Enigma> i deserved that
<RDash5000> DaringDerpy: you have to be alive to scream
<DaringDerpy> party time
<DaringDerpy> these torpedoes weren't nucular, RDash5000
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: and squeals.....*SQUEE*
<RDash5000> DaringDerpy: i never said they were. and its nuclear
<DaringDerpy> no it's not
<RDash5000> yes it is
<Polydunami> Am not! Are too!
<DaringDerpy> "About 315,000 results"
<CrazyHippie> FIGH FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT
<GigabitHarmonie> DaringDerpy! :)
<HoodyEvee> GIGA
<CrazyHippie> oh and hi guys
<DaringDerpy> hi GigabitHarmonie :)
<Polydunami> Hey there, CrazyHippie
<HoodyEvee> German scream
<CrazyHippie> hi Polydunami
<DaringDerpy> helicopters?
<HoodyEvee> Hai CrazyHippie
<CriticKitten> They found ya.
<CrazyHippie> Ello HoodyEvee
<Shizuka> 13oh speaking of scream
<RaveBrony> ooOOoo, movie??
<Shizuka> 13randomly remembered
<CrazyHippie> think so RaveBrony
<GigabitHarmonie> :) Nice seeing you, and HoodyEvee as well!
<Shizuka> 13there's a blatant wilhelm scream at the battle of bunker hill in AC3
<[]DeadpoolDash> DAS BOOT!!!!
<Polydunami> You mean Ace Combat?
<CrazyHippie> yes
<Shizuka> 13ass creed
<Shizuka> 13frrt
<Polydunami> Oh
<RaveBrony> o_o
<CrazyHippie> ass creep
<RDash5000> :D
<Shizuka> 13now they're in trouble
<Sumica> 00,10Armored Core 3?
<DaringDerpy> everyone staring at the ceiling
<RDash5000> ...fuck
<HoodyEvee> Ping~
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Pong~
<Shizuka> 13PING
<DaringDerpy> rage mode
<AssaultWithEmbraces> PONG
<Shizuka> 13it's like a high pitched MARCO
<RDash5000> ping=dead
<Sumica> 00,10those pigs how dare they try to kill us after we killed them
<DaringDerpy> ddos
<CrazyHippie> MARCO?
<CrazyHippie> BP|OOM!
<HoodyEvee> How are they gonna hear you ?
<DaringDerpy> hush now quiet now
<Buytoast> big ears
<weylin|Blarg> Sonar
<Shizuka> 13any vibration will make it easier to spot them
<CrazyHippie> like dolphins
<HoodyEvee> Ah
<HoodyEvee> Sensitive sonar
<Sumica> 00,10so dont bust ass in the sub
<[]DeadpoolDash> surprise...BUTTSECKS
<Buytoast> at least its not Happy Hitler Hymn Humming Hour
<RDash5000> Sumica: :D
<DaringDerpy> suddenly, pinkie pie
<Buytoast> otherwise they'd be in even MORE trouble
<Cypresswolf> *sneezes* O_O oops
<AssaultWithEmbraces> oh shit
<Sumica> 00,10some ones popcorn is done
*RDash5000 aliens motion tracker
<Shizuka> 13the sonar is picking up so the destroyer is certain where the sub is so far down
<RaveBrony> Oh damn
<Buytoast> you see what happens when you pee in a can?
<Buytoast> you doom your u-boat
<Shizuka> 13one of the notes about sonar tactics is the depth charges are shot off the stern of the hunter
<HoodyEvee> Buytoast: No, you attract deer
<Shizuka> 13the sonar pings cut out JUST before the explosions go off
<Buytoast> worst
<Sumica> 00,10we are underwater yet on fire I am so confussed
<DaringDerpy> fire is bad
<Buytoast> y6ou attract blood thirsty water deer
<Buytoast> the killers of the sea
<Shizuka> 13FIRE BAD
<HoodyEvee> That too
<Shizuka> 13TREE PRETTY
<Polydunami> They still have oxygen, Sumica
<CrazyHippie> there is no water IN the sub Sumica
<Sumica> 00,10not yet
<HoodyEvee> Shizuka: No trees in the ocean
<DaringDerpy> hehe
<Shizuka> 13now they have smoke
<Marco> ohai Shizuka and CrazyHippie C=
<Buytoast> bullshit they have trees in the ocean
<Sumica> 00,10some one roll down a window
<Buytoast> remember when spngebob broke his ass?
<CrazyHippie> POLO and hi Marco
<Shizuka> 13eh just put a dyson bladeless in there you'll be fine
<Marco> :>
<GigabitHarmonie> Think about being in a metal tank leagues under the seam inhaling smoke and all of your fresh air not existing.
<GigabitHarmonie> sea*
<Polydunami> That's about as smart as a screen door on a submarine
<Sumica> 00,10but Shizuka that would double the cost of that sub
<Shizuka> 13X3
<Shizuka> 13pssssst, capn, we don't want them to hear you
<Buytoast> you don't need freah air when you've got guts
<Buytoast> and an iron will
<CrazyHippie> the fire already took a lot of the oxygen anyway
<Shizuka> 13shshshshshshshshshshshshshshshshsh
<Shizuka> 13it's like halloween only actually tense
<Shizuka> 13SHH SHH SHH SHH
<Shizuka> 13PING PING PING PING
<CriticKitten> xD
<CrazyHippie> boom?
<Sumica> 00,10marco
<Marco> Hai
<AssaultWithEmbraces> lel
<RDash5000> aliens motion tracker noise...
<CriticKitten> You gun die. :D
<Shizuka> 13another note about depth charges is they're really only lethal at or below your depth
<Shizuka> 13captain you are not very good at this
<Shizuka> 13you're supposed to say POLO
<weylin|Blarg> CAPTAIN, SHUT UP
<Sumica> 00,10realy Shizuka?
<Polo> Who pinged?
<[]DeadpoolDash> the croc is coming for you captain
<Sumica> 00,10would have figured any thing close
<Shizuka> 13well close too
<Sumica> 00,10seeing as water dont compress
<CrazyHippie> Polo: Have another
<Shizuka> 13but they work by making a pocket of gas which smacks the water against itself
<Polydunami> Right, that's enough
<Polydunami> Out of me, at least
<Shizuka> 13the gas wants to go up so if a charge blows above you it's mostly going to direct it's force up
<Polydunami> They're going down?
<Sumica> 00,10they should shoot that gun at them next time they pass overhead
<CrazyHippie> underwater?
<Shizuka> 13so they're diving because the destroyer thinks they're higher up
<CrazyHippie> They would die from the pressure
<Shizuka> 13and might drop charges to blow up there, not down where they really are
<Sumica> 00,10they should crazy ivan
<Shizuka> 13but, as hydrophone guy's panic indicates
<Shizuka> 13destroyer ain't fooled
<Sumica> 00,10some one just had an idea
<Sumica> 00,10judgeing by that Lightbulb~
<[]DeadpoolDash> they need a stealth sub to absorb the pings
<Buytoast> shoot the torpedoes
<Buytoast> better yet
<Midnight_Fyre> Whoa, we're watching Das Boot? Wish I'd known earlier
<Buytoast> someone get on that deck side gun
<CrazyHippie> they need aplane XD []DeadpoolDash
<Shizuka> 13can't really shoot the torpedoes UP
<Polydunami> It was announced last night
<Sliverfish> HELLO!
<CriticKitten> No problem, just switch your deflector shields to maximum and devert power from the repulsors.....oh, right
<[]DeadpoolDash> space ship
<Midnight_Fyre> I wasn't here last night
<VenHur> You know guys? I can't draw anything, not even ponies or something original...
<Polydunami> Hey there, Silverfish
<Polydunami> Er, Sliverfish
<VenHur> I gives up.
<Saturn> 08,01i need somethim meaty and deep fried
<Shizuka> 13thank you for that brief dark green cut movie
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Saturn: chicken?
*Saturn 08,01goes a-hunting
<Buytoast> i'm sure they can do like an underwater backflip and shoot em as they move and stuff
<CrazyHippie> []DeadpoolDash: Thats no moon
<Shizuka> 13might just be me though, i have to watch this on small screen to stream it
<Saturn> 08,01AssaultWithEmbraces: unhealthier
<Sliverfish> *Gives Polydunami some chewing gum*
<[]DeadpoolDash> why do i always miss the survey on Thursday night
<Shizuka> 13that much rumbling gon give them away
<weylin|Blarg> Saturn, chili cheese fries?
<Shizuka> 13230 meters
<[]DeadpoolDash> its only 7:35PM on thursday
<Shizuka> 13the sub was only rated for 90
<Polydunami> Wow, you even got my favourite flavour! Trout flavour!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Uh guys, the ship is creaking
<Polydunami> :3
<Shizuka> 13popped bolts are an extremely bad thing
<AssaultWithEmbraces> That's...not a good sign. At all.
<DaringDerpy> too deep
<CriticKitten> Shit
<Shizuka> 13just one is reason to GTFO and go home
<DaringDerpy> momomomonsterkill
<Shizuka> 13but then we have half the movie left
<Midnight_Fyre> I don't think I can imagine how scary that would be
<CriticKitten> Well, bolts popping would mean plate separation, potentially, so yeah. Pretty much the worst possible thing.
<jcelios> plate?
<Shizuka> 13the hull
<Shizuka> 13a bolt popping means the pressure is starting to crush the hull
<Buytoast> you think they just wrap one piece of metal around like a burrito and send it out to sea?
<CrazyHippie> Im gonna go guys. It's getting late. See you later!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Buytoast, well that was the latest at the time
<Midnight_Fyre> later CrazyHippie
<Shizuka> 13they're in deeper trouble than before here because two destroyers looking for them
<Shizuka> 13way more depth charges to send in
<RDash5000> SHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHIT
<CriticKitten> The hull is a bunch of plates held together with bolts, jcelios. So if bolts start to pop off at high pressure, water can start to slip through the plates
<weylin|Blarg> FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Buytoast> well, at least they're not leaking fire
<jcelios> oic
<AssaultWithEmbraces> But they're leaking water. You can't swim to safety in fire.
<Polydunami> This movie is not for those who suffer from claustrophobia.
<CriticKitten> And thus, the whole damn ship could sink or come apart if the pressure continues, as the loss of one bolt weakens the whole structure (and thus puts more pressure on the bolts that remain)
<weylin|Blarg> or hydrophobia
<Shizuka> 13that would have been a charge above their depth there
<Polydunami> Or possibly both
<weylin|Blarg> or who have massive PTSD
<CriticKitten> So yeah, they're kinda in deep shit here. O.o
<Shizuka> 13heroic BSOD
<RDash5000> goodnight guys :) thanks for the stream Shizuka!
<weylin|Blarg> g'night RDash5000 :D
<Midnight_Fyre> gnight RDash5000
<Buytoast> this can't be good
<CriticKitten> He's lost it.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Night RDash5000
<DaringDerpy> he should try yoga
<Shizuka> 13yeah the subs are for english
<Shizuka> 13captain's just saying "do it johann" but subs translate three different hings
<Shizuka> 13and you can all guess what the captain went for
<Buytoast> i'm guessin he got a bad case of cabin fever?
<otakon> THE VODKA
<otakon> no wait
<DaringDerpy> what they said was more like "he's gone"
<weylin|Blarg> A WRENCH!
<otakon> so what's this movie about Shizuka ?
<Midnight_Fyre> Argh, my internet connection is crap tonight
<CriticKitten> Bolts aren't the only things that can crack under pressure.
<Midnight_Fyre> CriticKitten: Well said
<otakon> so what's up all?
<jcelios> you mean glass?
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: German Submarine
<otakon> and what is this movie about? Or mini-series I should say
<CriticKitten> otakon: We're watching a Shizu special, Das Boot. :3
<otakon> thank Midnight_Fyre
<Shizuka> 13THE submarine movie
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hey, it's an otakon~
<otakon> CriticKitten: and I missed most of it :(
<otakon> I was at work late tonight
<weylin|Blarg> The BEST submarine movie
<CriticKitten> Only about half.
<otakon> It was pretty damn busy
<CriticKitten> DAMN
<CriticKitten> They STILL know where they are?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Where do you work, otakon?
<DaringDerpy> he had to say it
<otakon> AssaultWithEmbraces: dishwasher
<CriticKitten> And still know they're down there, too. Shit.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> otakon: oooh
<Polydunami> Sinking fast?
<DaringDerpy> everything lower than 200 is bad
<CriticKitten> They need to find an escape route fast. ._.
<Shizuka> 1390
<Shizuka> 13the boat's only rated for 90, anything below that is bad
<CriticKitten> ....weird cut
<DaringDerpy> oh
<Polydunami> What is going on?
<Shizuka> 13clearly not dead
<CriticKitten> They're only rated for 90 meters? Shit, depth charges can get well below that even in the 40s. O.o
<Polydunami> Everyone is sleeping?
<Sliverfish> In the time it takes me to fap, Romney makes 1500 dollars
<DaringDerpy> lying on the bottom of the ocean, ballast pumps not working...must be of of the less funny ways to die
<Sliverfish> -_-
<CriticKitten> Those poor u-boat sailors were screwed if their subs were only able to get that deep. Geez.
<otakon> DaringDerpy: time to drink their own piss
<otakon> yeah being s sub crew was utter horror back then
<otakon> it was cramped, hot and you were at risk of being crushed to death at any moment really
<DaringDerpy> it's the kind of job I let other people do
<otakon> utter goddamn nightmare fuel
<weylin|Blarg> and that's IF you don't go insane first
<Midnight_Fyre> If a war broke out between first world nations with the technology to detect each others subs I bet it would become a horror again now
<CriticKitten> Still is, but imagine that. You're in a tight space and your boat is designed only to reach a 90m depth....when depth charges can clearly get well below that mark if they need to. No wonder the casualty rate was so high, the damn boats weren't nearly deep-sea-worthy enough for modern naval warfare. :/
<Sliverfish> Hufflepuff potato?
<Shizuka> 13let's review our cast
<Polydunami> Is this a dream>
<Polydunami> ?
<Sliverfish> WHAT IS LOVE?
<CriticKitten> Now that statistic at the start of the film doesn't surprise me. I'm actually more amazed there were any veterans of those damn things at all.
<Buytoast> oh no
<Buytoast> someone set the ocean on fire
<Shizuka> 13it's a tanker
<DaringDerpy> they waste a torpedo for a dead ship?
<CriticKitten> Wait, they hit it with two torpedoes didn't they? Or was it three?
<Shizuka> 13one i think
<SpeccyRush> if I recal they called them cows or something
<CriticKitten> And it's STILL not sinking?
<Shizuka> 13there were four in the convoy
<Shizuka> 13or might have been two
<Shizuka> 13but one last shot to make sure it goes down
<Shizuka> 13leave nothing for salvage
<otakon> goddamn
<CriticKitten> Oh, if it was just one, okay. But two or three? Wow, the damn thing's durable, gotta give it that
<CriticKitten> ....
<Shizuka> 13captain is understandably angered
<otakon> holy hell
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Nice way to alert your enemies where you are, guys.
<DaringDerpy> oh wow
<Buytoast> are those germans or enemies>
<Shizuka> 13brits
<Midnight_Fyre> enemies
<CriticKitten> That's....ugh
<Buytoast> ah
<otakon> survivors
<CriticKitten> They....they just abandoned them>
<CriticKitten> ._.
<otakon> CriticKitten: ofc, it's the war
<Shizuka> 13well
<Shizuka> 13two things
<weylin|Blarg> The ideology of ''For the Empire"
<otakon> they can't risk being caught
<Shizuka> 13one the captain is quite mad that the brits left their mates
<Shizuka> 13they had way more than enough time to rescue
<Shizuka> 13but our heroes here can't take prisoners
<CriticKitten> No kidding. Six hours is plenty of time.
<otakon> wow
<Shizuka> 13a) not allowed by the rules of engagement
<otakon> that's just... wow
<DanielBronies126> Movie ended?
<Shizuka> 13b) they're a sub, where the hell will they put prisoners?
<Buytoast> no real room for em
<CriticKitten> Yup.
<Midnight_Fyre> can't bring a prisoner on a U-boat. No room and way too easy to sabotage
<CriticKitten> Still....
<trixie_sprinkle> damn ive missed a part, what just happened? who abandoned the brits?
<Shizuka> 13so yeah
<jcelios> much less food etc.
<Shizuka> 13war is hell
<Buytoast> the brits
<CriticKitten> Ugh, that's awful.
<Buytoast> abandoned the brits
<trixie_sprinkle> hm ok
<otakon> wow
<AssaultWithEmbraces> trixie_sprinkle: The Brits abandoned theirr own men and left them for dead
<weylin|Blarg> It happens
<DaringDerpy> civilian tanker captains
<CriticKitten> I'm more appalled at the fact that the Brits just ditched their comrades.
<Shizuka> 13like we saiid, the german navy was notoriously displeased with the regime
<trixie_sprinkle> AssaultWithEmbraces: why? was there a battle going on?
<Shizuka> 13and yeah that's a bigger wtf why the brits left them
<Buytoast> they had 6 hours to save em
<Buytoast> and they didn't
<AssaultWithEmbraces> trixie_sprinkle: Well it was a war
<CriticKitten> That's just disgusting, honestly.
<DaringDerpy> CriticKitten: war
<trixie_sprinkle> AssaultWithEmbraces: i know but im asking why they were abandoned
<CriticKitten> Being left on a tanker full of burning gasoline for hours....
<CriticKitten> Some of them on fire....
*CriticKitten shudders
<DaringDerpy> because someone decided it were too risky
<AssaultWithEmbraces> trixie_sprinkle: Where would you put the prisoners on a sub?
<trixie_sprinkle> AssaultWithEmbraces: not asking about germans, i meant the brits
<Buytoast> well maybe they could've...
<Shizuka> 13and worse still the ship goes down, now you're stuck in the middle of nowhere
<Buytoast> sandiwhced them all together
<weylin|Blarg> and there's blood in the water
<CriticKitten> Yep. You get to die of thirst.
<CriticKitten> In the ocean.
<trixie_sprinkle> even if sandwiched, thatd be more weight, more supplies, more stink, and its cramped there already
<AssaultWithEmbraces> trixie_sprinkle: The brits and Germans are enemies. The Brits never got rescued and there's no room on the German sub for them
<otakon> CriticKitten: Irony
<DaringDerpy> "When I give the order"
<Buytoast> should've built fireproof row boats
<CriticKitten> Which is fucking AWFUL.
<otakon> Buytoast: out of what?
<CriticKitten> If you're lucky you'll just drown.
<trixie_sprinkle> AssaultWithEmbraces: i knooow, im asking why the Brits abandoned the Brits
<DaringDerpy> it's winter there
<CriticKitten> If not, the salt water dehydrates you and you die a bit more slowly from that. Either way, just ick
<Midnight_Fyre> trixie_sprinkle: Who knows? Germans were wondering the same thing
<AssaultWithEmbraces> trixie_sprinkle: couldn't risk being caught
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I think.
<trixie_sprinkle> ok
<DaringDerpy> trixie_sprinkle: it happens all the time. forget the glory and comradeship nonsense. in war, people get sacrificed
<Midnight_Fyre> We should watch Stalingrad
<trixie_sprinkle> DaringDerpy: i know, guess russia wasnt the only one who did that to their soldiers
<CriticKitten> Incidentally this same thing is happening to US soldiers in Iraq/Afghanistan who are out for long tours of service.
<DaringDerpy> modern war is extremely clean compared to back then
<CriticKitten> That much time in a high stress environment just eats away at a person.
<Shizuka> 13ja here's something to get you thinking
<Shizuka> 13this is based on a book, written by a guy who was a war correspondent on subs
<mycutiemarkisagun> ugh
<Shizuka> 13lt werner is basically the author avatar
<Shizuka> 13the author did not like this movie
<mycutiemarkisagun> i know i've hit rock bottom when i type /join #bronystate
<Shizuka> 13said it reglorified and remystified the sub warfare
<Midnight_Fyre> DaringDerpy: Different sort of enemy. If America/Britain got into a war with Germany/Japan today it would be much less "clean"
<DaringDerpy> the book is far better. as always
<Shizuka> 13now, just about everyone who ever sees das boot goes "how the hell is this glorious"
<DaringDerpy> Midnight_Fyre: probably
<Shizuka> 13which makes you wonder
<CriticKitten> No kidding.
<Shizuka> 13what was the REAL war like if the author thinks THIS is glorious
<mycutiemarkisagun> Japan doesn't have a Military now
<CriticKitten> This movie's fucking depressing.
<mycutiemarkisagun> back then they were a imperialist war machine
<CriticKitten> And if this is glorifying it, then how mind-numbingly depressing must the book be
<weylin|Blarg> my brain's definitely full of fuck now
<mycutiemarkisagun> and Germany's just conquered Europe economically anyway
<Shizuka> 13that too
<Shizuka> 13going to keep trying to find an ebook of das boot
<DaringDerpy> be happy if you've never seen any war
<Shizuka> 13that order is suicide
<Midnight_Fyre> mycutiemarkisagun: Yes and no. Although they don't call it a military, their "self defense force" is actually one of the most highly funded and advanced armed forces in the world.
<otakon> Shizuka: yikes
<Shizuka> 13they're in the atlantic
<CriticKitten> ....
<Shizuka> 13they've been ordered to italy, which means going through the strait of gibraltar
<Shizuka> 13the most heavily defended pass in the seas
<Sliverfish> GANGNAM STYLE HAS
<otakon> which is full of mines right?
<DaringDerpy> japan has a ministry of defense again for a year or so
<Sliverfish> 900 MILLION VIEWS!!!!
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: yep
<otakon> yeah
<DaringDerpy> they have problems with china and north korea
<otakon> basically suicide mission
<Buytoast> well its either that or run outta fuel
<CriticKitten> The rudding fuck is their CO thinking?
<Buytoast> and supplies
<mycutiemarkisagun> oh north korea
<Shizuka> 13orders came from higher up
<SpeccyRush> if it's the only port left
<DaringDerpy> so "eye of the needle" is american for "virgin"
<weylin|Blarg> Then the real fight is just starting for them
<mycutiemarkisagun> shame on all these pussies for giving us North Korean invaders instead of the Red Chinese horde we deserve
<mycutiemarkisagun> Red Dawn, that FPS whatsitsname
<CriticKitten> With their ship so damaged....
<Midnight_Fyre> It's an insult to even suggest that North Korean soldiers could get near the American mainland
<CriticKitten> There's no way in hell they should make it. o.O
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Equestria Inquirer #62
<mycutiemarkisagun> North Korea couldn't militarily occupy Camden, New Jersey
<DaringDerpy> only one man went crazy
<weylin|Blarg> One man can threaten an entire ship
<weylin|Blarg> create doubt, 'spread' insanity, etc.
<Midnight_Fyre> North Korea has a big military, but it is incredibly outdated and they have little fuel
<mycutiemarkisagun> Midnight_Fyre they have a sekrit weapon :x
<mycutiemarkisagun> *weppin
<otakon> mycutiemarkisagun: sekrit?
<Shizuka> 13i should show red dawn rifftrax some time
<otakon> weppin?
<otakon> Shizuka: yes please :)
<SpeccyRush> mycutiemarkisagun: Homefront?
<DaringDerpy> they have no blue water fleet
<weylin|Blarg> Shizuka YES
<CriticKitten> ...the original Red Dawn? Oh lord. XD
<mycutiemarkisagun> yeah homefront
<otakon> the Sean Connery riffs alone will be worth it
<otakon> SEAN CONNERY!
<Shizuka> 13it's mike and... i forget who's with him
<mycutiemarkisagun> the original Red Dawn is like All Quiet on the Western Front compared to the new one
<mycutiemarkisagun> almost everybody dies in the original Red Dawn
<Midnight_Fyre> I believe it. I didn't waste my money to find out
<DaringDerpy> they enter the port submerged?
<DaringDerpy> at night?
<DaringDerpy> bad show
<otakon> no
<Shizuka> 13probably because of spy planes etc
<Midnight_Fyre> Of course, I rarely go to the theater these days anyway
<otakon> they're doing it in secret
<DaringDerpy> yes
<CriticKitten> Pft, what else are they gonna do? They're basically screwed anyways, may as well try to be sneaky. XD
<mycutiemarkisagun> and the director did wanna do it more as a grim survivalist sorta deal before the studio intervened
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: have you seen Wreck-It Ralph?
<trixie_sprinkle> theyre entering port....
<trixie_sprinkle> AT NIGHT
<Sumica> 00,10playing around with new parts on kerbal.
<otakon> hiya Sumica what's up?
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: nope. I'll wait till DVD
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: :( it really isn't the same experience in this case
<Sumica> 00,10manage to launch probe on a solar escape course
<otakon> yay?
<Shizuka> 13look how haggard they are
<otakon> yeah look at these asshats
<DaringDerpy> fresh food
<otakon> all dressed up
<otakon> shaved
<otakon> fucking clean
<Midnight_Fyre> I saw Lincoln the other day because I'm a Civil War buff (it was OK), but that was the first time I'd been in a theater in months. Although I'm pissed that noplace around me was showing Celebration Day
<DaringDerpy> hahaha
<weylin|Blarg> lol
<Shizuka> 13hero
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: Celebration Day?
<DaringDerpy> bureaucrats
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: Concert documentary of Led Zeppelin's 2007 concert at the O2 Arena
<Shizuka> 13if ever there was a movie to scream WAR IS HELL, this is it
<NocturnalBlade> aaaaaand i have returned! ^_^
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: oh
<otakon> wb NocturnalBlade
<CriticKitten> ....dat food
<weylin|Blarg> heya NocturnalBlade :)
<CriticKitten> These people are flaming asshats.
<NocturnalBlade> Did I miss anything?
<otakon> it isn't easy here
<Shizuka> 13look at this first world problem guy
<otakon> IT ISN'T EASY HERE?
<Polydunami> Damn you, Germany. You're inciting gluttonous desires within me.
<Midnight_Fyre> I'm also a big Led Zeppelin fan. I think there are only 2 or 3 Zeppelin PMVs on Youtube and one of them is mine
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Oh he fancy, huh?
<otakon> punch him
<otakon> PUNCH THAT PONCEY FUCK
<DaringDerpy> now kiss
<weylin|Blarg> EW HE PUT IT BACK
<CriticKitten> This man is, to steal a Yahtzee phrase, the ponciest ponce ever to ponce past a poncing parlor. :|
<CriticKitten> And I just want to reach through my screen and deck 'im.
<Midnight_Fyre> Wait, did I miss something? Where are they?
<weylin|Blarg> They're on the Weser
<weylin|Blarg> in dock
<Midnight_Fyre> ah
<Shizuka> 13german barge in spain refueling and rearming them
<Shizuka> 13they've been ordered to italy, and must pass through the most defended area in the mediterranean
<Midnight_Fyre> what year is this again?
<Shizuka> 1341
<Shizuka> 13i think
<DaringDerpy> so early?
<Midnight_Fyre> thanks
<CriticKitten> Well it fucking sucks, thanks for asking
<DaringDerpy> I'd say 42 or 43
<DaringDerpy> not sure
<Midnight_Fyre> Yeah, the U Boat fleet got wiped out pretty early in the war, really
<Shizuka> 13well they said christmas so
<Shizuka> 13late late 41
<AssaultWithEmbraces> God, that chicken looks delicious
<Midnight_Fyre> I think
<NocturnalBlade> dang i missed the chicken :(
<DaringDerpy> wikipedia says 41 too
<CriticKitten> ....uh oh.
<CriticKitten> Dat face.
<Shizuka> 13not a happy face
<weylin|Blarg> Something isn't right
<AssaultWithEmbraces> oh boy
<CriticKitten> And see, that's some good acting. Just his face expresses everything you need to know.
<Shizuka> 13request to return to la rochelle and get out of the coffin boat, denied
<DaringDerpy> so the big bosses are still full of victory and superiority
<Buytoast> damn
<weylin|Blarg> All that bread
<trixie_sprinkle> expressing a negative emotion facially isnt that hard though
<CriticKitten> Question is, why are they sending this boat on a suicide mission? How late in the war is this
<CriticKitten> ?
<Shizuka> 13who knows
<Shizuka> 1341
<DaringDerpy> late 41. the invasion in russia just got stalled
<Polydunami> This is still in 1941. The Germans are high on hubris
<Polydunami> Well, at least the bigwigs are
<CriticKitten> Oh, so there's still a few years yet.
<weylin|Blarg> At least with the world concerned with Germany
<DaringDerpy> they expected to have moscov before winter
<Shizuka> 13feel really dumb that i don't remember, pearl harbor was 42 right?
<CriticKitten> So this is a bit surprising. They're sending one boat? Baffling. ._.
<Polydunami> No, that was 41
<Polydunami> So it already happened
<Shizuka> 13how soon after did we join in ?
<DaringDerpy> yes, a few weeks ago in movie
<Shizuka> 13that might be part of it, send the u-boat to reinforce italy
<CriticKitten> It was almost immediately IIRC.
<Shizuka> 13with the americans coming
<weylin|Blarg> This is Christmas, right? In the movie?
<Polydunami> Basically right away
<DaringDerpy> hitler declared war on the us right after pearl harbor
<Polydunami> December 7th, 1941
<Shizuka> 13so it was 41
<weylin|Blarg> Yep
<Shizuka> 13so that's my best guess
<CriticKitten> Since at the time, the US was basically getting primed to join Britian prior to Pearl Harbor anyways
<otakon> holy hell
<Barbetos> The boot is over there stream.
<Barbetos> See it?
<Shizuka> 13send the u-boat to italy to help them out against the impending americans
<CriticKitten> Thus the whole reason the Japanese attacked: hoping to disable our fleet so we'd take longer to join the war
<otakon> it's the 71st anniversary of Pearl Harbor
<DaringDerpy> africa war maybe
<Shizuka> 13or that
<DaringDerpy> never really ended
<StrayPony> Germany and Italy declared war on the USa on Dec 11, 1941. we rciprocated same day
<CriticKitten> Might be. But wouldn't they want to send more than one u-boat?
<Shizuka> 13is it terribly dark for everyone or just me because of my lighting
<CriticKitten> No, it's dark
<otakon> Shizuka: for me too
<DaringDerpy> it is dark
<Shizuka> 13hm
<Polydunami> It is kind of dark
<otakon> but it's the picture
<CriticKitten> Think it's supposed to be.
<Shizuka> 13i turned the settings up but ja might just be the point
<otakon> Shizuka: just the point
<CriticKitten> ....
<CriticKitten> That's a lotta ships.
<weylin|Blarg> lol half
<DaringDerpy> my last train goes in 45 minutes -_-
<DaringDerpy> can't see the whole movie
<Shizuka> 13he said they have 12 u-boats in the atlantic, dunno where the rest of the fleet would be at the moment (surely they have more than 12)
<Shizuka> 13so might be more u-boats going in
<Shizuka> 13just not as far as our guys know
<CriticKitten> They had somewhere around 200 IIRC.
<Shizuka> 13little better?
<CriticKitten> Maybe a bit less
<DaringDerpy> too much gives me a headache
<CriticKitten> Well, wait. No, this was WW2....
*CriticKitten ponders
<CriticKitten> So they probably had as many as a thousand, even.
<Polydunami> That picture
<Shizuka> 13lol that sub was early
<CriticKitten> Their production rate was higher during WWII because of the huge growth in tech between WWI and WWII.
<Shizuka> 13fullscreen might help you guys if it's too dark
<CriticKitten> That much I do remember.
<Shizuka> 13dammit johann
<CriticKitten> Shit.
<otakon> OH SHIT
<otakon> welp dead
<Buytoast> well shit
<Polydunami> Is that Werner?
<weylin|Blarg> That blood squirt
<CriticKitten> They spotted them before they could dive.
<CriticKitten> They're screwed.
<otakon> and then the Captian literally went down with the ship
<DaringDerpy> great...the navigator
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Wait what happened?
<otakon> You know I know these guys are the "enemy"
<CriticKitten> With that many ships in the area....they're almost assuredly going to get sunk. ._.
<otakon> AssaultWithEmbraces: they got spooted
<weylin|Blarg> And there's the captain
<DaringDerpy> for the extra drama
<otakon> But I want to see them LIVE DAMMIT!
<otakon> also KICK ASS MUSIC
<DaringDerpy> being spotted in the middle of an enemy fleet
<CriticKitten> They got spotted early on, too.
<DaringDerpy> time to dive
<otakon> damn he jumped down
<CriticKitten> Before they could get close enough for the long guns not to be a problem.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> What happened to the dude?
<Buytoast> uh oh
<Shizuka> 13strafed by plane up top
<otakon> not THAT is going manual
<CriticKitten> Oh god.
<Buytoast> their diveamabobber is stuck it seems
<otakon> yeah they're going down
<CriticKitten> ....
<otakon> holy hell this is tense
<CriticKitten> They're going down much too fast.
<weylin|Blarg> WAY too fast
<otakon> O_O
<DaringDerpy> nope
<Shizuka> 13shades of lemongrab there
<CriticKitten> Dropping that fast would damage the sub anyways, even at a tolerable pressure level. ._.
<otakon> O_o
<DaringDerpy> and that's it
<Shizuka> 13sub's already hurting
*AssaultWithEmbraces chews her fingers intensley
<DaringDerpy> game over
<otakon> and here comes the crunch
<Buytoast> the end has come
<weylin|Blarg> And then...BANG
<CriticKitten> Yup. Bolts blowing.
<CriticKitten> .....
<otakon> :(
<trixie_sprinkle> the journalist guy is still there?
<Polydunami> We have maybe 45 minutes to go in the movie
<AssaultWithEmbraces> That guy looks like his head is about to blow. literally
<CriticKitten> They're dead.
<Shizuka> 13bottom
<Midnight_Fyre> I was out the last 10 minutes or so. Where are they going now?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Shit
<Shizuka> 13down
<DaringDerpy> now the fun begins
<jcelios> ded
<trixie_sprinkle> damn, tough luck
<DaringDerpy> off the scale is bad
<CriticKitten> .....oh no.
<otakon> they're NOT DEAD YET DAMMIT!
<jcelios> tey ded
<CriticKitten> They're gonna be stuck there, aren't they. ._.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> We've reached rock bottom, guys.
<DaringDerpy> saved by rock
<otakon> Saved by Tom
<CriticKitten> Please, please tell me I'm wrong. Because otherwise that is the most horrifying possible way to die.
<weylin|Blarg> And the look of fear on their faces
<otakon> CriticKitten: no idea
<DaringDerpy> buried alive
<Shizuka> 13they'll come back up
<DaringDerpy> german engineering
<Shizuka> 13the movie ends on the surface
<jcelios> of hell
<AssaultWithEmbraces> oh, this CAN'T be good
<CriticKitten> Not even buried. Alive, trapped in a metal box under the water. Water slowly leaking in....
<NocturnalBlade> and everything bronke
<Polydunami> Slowly?
<NocturnalBlade> *broke
<DaringDerpy> what were they waiting for?
<otakon> CriticKitten: yeah best not to think about that too hard?
<CriticKitten> Not knowing if the hull will burst and kill you quick, or if you'll just starve to death down there. I can't imagine a worse death at sea than a sunken sub like thois. ._.
<CriticKitten> *this
<Barbetos> When I watch movies or shows what involve water or drowning I feel I can't breathe at times. Its really disturbing.
<weylin|Blarg> My god, the feels I'll feel at the end of this movie ;A;
<CriticKitten> So uh, how is this glorifying sub warfare again? Because seriously, I feel like I need uppers after this.
<Barbetos> I have always wondered if that is just me though =P
<Cii> ...
<Barbetos> And then chat died XD
<Ponies47> Good night everypony. Thank you all I had a wonderful birthday today! ^_^
*Polydunami hugs Ponies47
<DaringDerpy> happy birthday, Ponies47 :)
<weylin|Blarg> g'night Ponies47, and happy birthday! :)
<Polydunami> Happy birthday, Ponies47
<Barbetos> Oh bappy hirthday Ponies47
<DaringDerpy> and good night
<StrayPony> Glorifying sub warfare? Das Boot is an anti war book
<Barbetos> =P
<wipergone2> happy birthday
<Cii> :D
<CriticKitten> Barbetos: I always tend to feel terrible when I see situations like this, where I can visualize myself in that situation and the sheer terror I'd feel in that same place.
<Midnight_Fyre> Happy birthday Ponies47
<Valvad> I just got on whats playing?
<DaringDerpy> StrayPony: it's harmless. only one got wounded so far, one got crazy for a moment
<Midnight_Fyre> Das Boot
<Cii> ^^^
<weylin|Blarg> 'son of a pig' just how censored is the English version?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> night Ponies47
<Valvad> Thanks
<CriticKitten> StrayPony: The author of that book said he didn't like this movie because it was glorifying sub warfare
*AssaultWithEmbraces gives Ponies47 a cake
<CriticKitten> Which makes me think that the author of that book wrote a very fucking depressing book
<Valvad> Needs a Cupcake!
<VenHur> Got to go for the night.
<DaringDerpy> read it
*Internet_Dash walks in to the room
<CriticKitten> Like Elfen Lied on steroids
<DaringDerpy> good night VenHur
<NocturnalBlade> nite Ponies47 ^_^
<VenHur> P.S: I HATE the new Youtube layout...
<weylin|Blarg> night VenHur ovo
<CriticKitten> ....
<AssaultWithEmbraces> night VenHur
<Cii> hm.
<DaringDerpy> they don't even translate half of the text
<Midnight_Fyre> VerHur: Mee too. Is it just my imagination or is the sound quality different too?
<Valvad> Just when I get use to a Youtube Layout, They make it more confusing
<NocturnalBlade> nite ven
<CriticKitten> So, let's review. They're trapped in a ship slowly filling with water, diesel fumes, and battery acid.
<DaringDerpy> all this 280 metres below the surface
<Shizuka> 13way below rated depth
<weylin|Blarg> And the bolts are already popping
<Valvad> They didnt run out of air yet?
<CriticKitten> Oh no. That'll take time, as the diesel fumes slowly fill the cabins.
<Valvad> :P
<Midnight_Fyre> CriticKitten: I know what I'd do if I were in their position: Cry like a little girl
<jcelios> I'd pray to celestia
<DaringDerpy> I can work like a clockwork under such stress
<Afflict> hey
<Midnight_Fyre> Maybe I'd try giggling at the water
<Stormy> hi
<DaringDerpy> distracts from the fear
<Midnight_Fyre> would that work?
<Shizuka> 1350 pfennig is 50 cents
<Saturn> 08,01wheee
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Giggle at the Ghosties doesn't apply there, Midnight_Fyre.
<Saturn> 08,01i love Community!
<Midnight_Fyre> nuts
<CriticKitten> They get major props for being able to even function in this situation.
*AssaultWithEmbraces hugs Saturn
<jcelios> But... but granny pie!
<Shizuka> 13i think johann just made up for his BSOD earlier
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Midnight_Fyre: You'll be giggling at yourself because you'd be a ghostie
<weylin|Blarg> So the Mark went back down?
*Cii sits in a corner
<DaringDerpy> now the engines and off she goes
<Shizuka> 13they need to get floating first
<CriticKitten> Aye.
<DaringDerpy> oh, yes. important detail ^^
<CriticKitten> Which means finding a way to empty their ballist.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> They obviously didn't think this through.
<CriticKitten> *ballast? I always misspell that word >.>
<weylin|Blarg> it's ballast
<CriticKitten> Without the draining pump, uh....not actually sure how they're gonna do that.
*Saturn 08,01nuzzles AssaultWithEmbraces
<AssaultWithEmbraces> How are some people still asleep after all that?
<jcelios> he's hurt
*Cii has no clue whats going on...
<Shizuka> 13mister nazi is starting to have a crisis of faith in the system
<Shizuka> 13notice his stubble
<Cii> ...
<DaringDerpy> navigator half dead, comm dead, navigation equipment dead
<Midnight_Fyre> Ah yes, eah modern movie about German military members must have a part where they question Nazism
<CriticKitten> SYMBOLISM
<NocturnalBlade> same here Cii
<Shizuka> 13well, again the navy was notoriously not very pro-nazi
<CriticKitten> Midnight_Fyre: To be fair, there were lots of Germans who did
<Midnight_Fyre> true
<NocturnalBlade> But that partly because i missed like half the movie XD
<DaringDerpy> Midnight_Fyre: some of the young authors are past that. the conservatives and the leftist still love to incantate nazi
<Cii> :/
<CriticKitten> But the regime spun things so that it sounded like everyone was happy with them
<CriticKitten> (naturally)
<CriticKitten> ....oh, they're having people go to sleep to try to conserve oxygen?
<weylin|Blarg> Seems that way
<Shizuka> 13which i guess makes sense? i'm not entirely certain how your breathing pattern works while asleep
<CriticKitten> I guess that's not a bad idea, though....not sure I'd be able to sleep not knowing if I'd wake up
<Shizuka> 13i would think you're taking deeper breaths which is bad
<jcelios> its alot less
<Buytoast> is he sneakin food?
<Sumica> 00,10your heartrate drops when sleeping
<Shizuka> 13but then most of them are using masks so balances out
<Midnight_Fyre> Either way, I couldn't sleep under those conditions
<CriticKitten> Generally you use up less oxygen while you sleep because your body doesn't need it as badly.
<Shizuka> 13right
<CriticKitten> So in theory it's a decent idea.
<Shizuka> 13any way you slice it you're hosed though
<CriticKitten> Just not sure if it's enough, though, with the fumes.
<Shizuka> 13this is the guy that broke his ribs
<CriticKitten> Either way the diesel fumes are eating up what little oxygen you have anyways, so... :/
<otakon> great I'm getting skipping
<SpeccyRush> .
<Cii> ?
<CCharmanderK> Back from my dentist appointment and three straight hours of hellish pain.
<trixie_sprinkle> CCharmanderK: wisdom tooth?
<jcelios> be thankful you arent these poor bastards
<wipergone2> hi
<Midnight_Fyre> I am
<CCharmanderK> Wisdom TEETH. ALL of them.
<Shizuka> 13ow
<Polydunami> Just because?
<Shizuka> 13glad mine have come in straight
<wipergone2> Shizuka: hi
<trixie_sprinkle> CCharmanderK: dayum, well at lesdt its over
<CCharmanderK> Shizuka: You have no idea.
<CriticKitten> Mine aren't perfect, but aren't growing out badly enough to cause problems
<Sumica> 00,10that moment in KSP when your realise floodlights will power solar pannles
<CCharmanderK> trixie_sprinkle: Oh please, getting them out was the easy part.
<CriticKitten> So we left 'em.
<otakon> Sumica: lol
<[]DeadpoolDash> power forever
<Buytoast> hell my teeth are screwed to all hell
<CCharmanderK> Now I gotta deal with a bleeding mouth and nonstop pain for the next day or two.
<Buytoast> can stick my thunb in the gap between my froont upper and my front lower
<CriticKitten> I'm still amazed they sent one boat alone through that strait.
<Buytoast> with my mouth closed
<Buytoast> so did that plane get em while they were in the strait?
<CCharmanderK> My jaws are in so much pain. >_<
<SpeccyRush> Sumica: infinte power?
<Shizuka> 13ha bad translation
<Sumica> 00,10not quite
<Sumica> 00,10some drop off
<Shizuka> 13he said closer to "that's a terrible trick"
<CriticKitten> The plane spotted them, and they were shelled with artillery so badly that their sub's systems jammed and they sunk to the bottom of the strait, Buytoast
<Buytoast> so they were in the strait then
<CriticKitten> Still are.
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Polydunami> I thought he was being sarcastic there
<Shizuka> 13at the bottom of the strait of gibraltar, hopefully closer to africa
<jcelios> man I want a pocket watch
<trixie_sprinkle> why is journalist guy still there
<CriticKitten> They're stuck at the bottom of the strait, unable to move.
<jcelios> be all posh en shit yo
<CCharmanderK> Kill me. >_<
<CriticKitten> ....15 hours?
<Shizuka> 1315 hours at the bottom of the sea
<CriticKitten> Christ.
<Shizuka> 13there's a distasteful pirate song in there somewhere
<CriticKitten> That's just....argh. I don't even want to imagine myself in that situation. How they've stayed sane is beyond me. ._.;
<Sumica> 00,10I belive it goes In the navy~
<Midnight_Fyre> Argh, I can't keep a damn internet connection for five minutes
<weylin|Blarg> Aaaaaaand there he goes :c
<trixie_sprinkle> give him a hug, capn
<Shizuka> 13just enough
<DaringDerpy> time to go to school. have fun, bronies! :)
<[]DeadpoolDash> which empire do you guys play as in PS2?
<CriticKitten> Wow
<weylin|Blarg> bye DaringDerpy :)
<Polydunami> See you, DaringDerpy
<CriticKitten> That faint glimmer of hope.
<gunthler> lawl, wat about dat new YouTube layout?
<Polydunami> Is this a hope spot?
<wipergone2> Polydunami: D
<Shizuka> 13hope spot
<CriticKitten> Also damn this is well acted
<wipergone2> Polydunami: :D
<Polydunami> What is it?
<Polydunami> Is there something on my face?
<weylin|Blarg> I have to imagine all these guys are method actors
<wipergone2> Phase4: hi
<CriticKitten> And you can see clearly that the oxygen's just about run out.
<CriticKitten> Judging by their breathing.
<Buytoast> so they're goin for teh french town regardless now?
<weylin|Blarg> only half a bottle?
<Shizuka> 13yep
<[]DeadpoolDash> so no answer on the PlanetSide 2 empire question?
<Shizuka> 13screw the orders, they're in no condition to get there at all
<Buytoast> fair enough
<trixie_sprinkle> what was their original goal?
<CriticKitten> Yeah, there's no way they could have made it even beforehand.
<Shizuka> 13italy
<trixie_sprinkle> o ok
<CriticKitten> Much less now.
<Shizuka> 13so yeah, it's limp home or bust
<weylin|Blarg> RED ALERT, LADS! LOOK ALIVE!
<CriticKitten> Oh you tease.
<CriticKitten> That gauge is trolling.
<trixie_sprinkle> we'll be right back, after these messages!
<Yahooz> dat nick change
<futagunny> o3o
*futagunny shakes around
<otakon> futagunny: wat?

<CriticKitten> inb4 they surface and the boats are all right there. "OHAI UBOAT" *BOOM* >_>
<trixie_sprinkle> what are those swag glasses he put on
<Shizuka> 13futagunny: Change your nick back.
<CriticKitten> That'd be a really cruel way to end the movie.
<Jmo> Not surprised.

<weylin|Blarg> AIR! BLESSED, GLORIOUS AIR!
<Midnight_Fyre> Yay!
<Shizuka> 13now
<Shizuka> 13the first thing i'd do
<Shizuka> 13is find something white
<Shizuka> 13and run it up a pole
<CriticKitten> Agreed
<weylin|Blarg> but NO
<sub06905> :D
<weylin|Blarg> these are GERMANS
<Polydunami> Well, at least they're not Japanese soldiers
<weylin|Blarg> ^
<Shizuka> 13WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<wipergone2> woooooooooooooooooooooooo
<trixie_sprinkle> WAZUUUUUUUP
<Shizuka> 13now for that oldest of tactics to RUN AWAAAAAAY
<wipergone2> lol
<Polydunami> This is just going to end SMASHINGLY :|
<otakon> RUN AWAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
<Midnight_Fyre> If they were Japanese soldiers they probably would have stayed at the bottom claiming it was their duty to die for the emperor
<CriticKitten> They bravely ran away~
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: I'm sorry but I found that amusing.. I'm a horrible person :#
<trixie_sprinkle> Midnight_Fyre: if they were japanese soldiers, theyd resurface just to ram an enemy ship :D
<Shizuka> 13DismemberedDashie: Change your nick, we do not discuss Cupcakes here.
<DismemberedDashie> what?
<DismemberedDashie> this has nothing to do with Cupcakes.
<sub06905> ....
<Shizuka> 13Sure it doesn't.
<Shizuka> 13Change your nick.
<wipergone2> cupcakes.exe
<trixie_sprinkle> DismemberedDashie: still inapproriate
<DismemberedDashie> my nick is about the fic My Little Dashie
<DismemberedDashie> not Cupcakes.
<DismemberedDashie> jeez.
<Buytoast> AHAHAHA
*sub06905 sings along
<Buytoast> oh right
<Shizuka> 13Last chance DismemberedDashie.
<Buytoast> the navigator
<DismemberedDashie> ok ok fine
<Futasaw_Hoover> jeez
<Futasaw_Hoover> so touchy about names here
<Polydunami> He's out of here.
<wipergone2> SuperBrony64: u there?
<Yahooz> Kick
<Buytoast> welp
<Yahooz> there we go
<[]DeadpoolDash> which PlanetSide Server do you all play on?
<CriticKitten> Newfillies can't brainforce.
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: Actually it's not too far from the truth. I recently read an autobiography of a Kamikaze pilot. He survived because when they flew out looking for ships it was too foggy and they would have inevitably crashed into the water after running out of fuel, and he said that when they returned the higher officers reprimanded them for not doing just that
<sub06905> people just font get it do they? :I
<sub06905> dont*
<Shizuka> 13so trivia, this is after spielberg made off with the boat and ruined it
<Shizuka> 13this version of the u-boat is mostly wood
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: O_o those CO's are IDIOTS, seriously wasting resources like that
<weylin|Blarg> just mostly
<Sumica> 00,10sad to say no kerbals were harmed in the launching of this probe http://screensnapr.com/v/Pb9xiD.jpg
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: exactly what the author said
<ShizukaYouAreFunny> yo uh
<Yahooz> ban evade
<ShizukaYouAreFunny> it was a compliment
<ShizukaYouAreFunny> you didn't even ban me
<Polydunami> He was not banned
<otakon> he was just kicked
<Yahooz> oh lel hes right
<otakon> and NOW he was banned I think
<ok> but really Shizuka you need to learn to chill
<Shizuka> 13Get out.
<ok> man we have unfinished business
<otakon> ok: dude don't antagonize the mods
<Yahooz> oh boy...
<[]DeadpoolDash> does anyone even play Planetside 2 anymore?
<sub06905> Sumica: thats amazing
<Buytoast> head thicker than a steel coconut
<AdamTheDuck> []DeadpoolDash, and yes, New Conglomerate. Sorry I was just watching the movie, a friend on the computer
<CriticKitten> Like I said. Newfillies can't brainforce. >_>
<Yahooz> hey, ok, ARE YOU OKAY?
<otakon> []DeadpoolDash: dude Wrek and Sumica play it all the time
<ok> otakon Shizuka's antagonized me over the past year or so more than I have antagonized Shizuka.
<Yahooz> ...insert Saxy here
<trixie_sprinkle> welp
<Polydunami> BUSTAH WOLF

<trixie_sprinkle> wait was that the captain?
<otakon> wow they go through HELL
<sub06905> :>
<Buytoast> after all they've been through
<otakon> just for THAT to happen
<AdamTheDuck> Obligatory; War, war never changes.
<ok> otakon, that's silly. If he's a mod, he is in the public eye. He should be exposed as a poor moderator and dealt with accordingly.
<Polydunami> So the sub basically lured the planes there?
<Kencolt> weylin|Blarg: At this time the Brits, America wasn't in the war yet. Japan hadn't pulled off pearl Harbor.
<Shizuka> 13he?
<otakon> ok: well she, typo on my part
<otakon> Shizuka: typo on my part
<ok> oh ok
<ok> she then.
<ok> sorry about that ^_^
<CriticKitten> ok: Bitch to someone who cares. Aka not here.
<weylin|Blarg> Alright. Thanks, Kencolt
<otakon> ok: still if you have issues about that, take it up with another mod here
<OtakuTom> Midnight_Fyre, movement from the shockwave?

<OtakuTom> So yea, I have awesome news!
<trixie_sprinkle> these guys dont get a breeak
<Midnight_Fyre> OtakuTom: Nah, I think just a movie mistake
<otakon> OtakuTom: you got a pony?
<AdamTheDuck> []DeadpoolDash, and check my Steam, I wasted so much of my holidays on that game already ;~;
<OtakuTom> I wish otakon...lol
<sub06905> MEDIC!
<ok> if you think modding an IRC channel is like a job, you're sorely misguided.
<CriticKitten> Welp, they've had a hell of a day.
<Midnight_Fyre> OtakuTom: yes? Good news?
<otakon> ok: well it is a responsibility
<weylin|Blarg> NO, JOHANN! ;A;
<Buytoast> well shit
<otakon> oh not them
<ok> A PASSIVE responsibility.
<Shizuka> 13Well I was considering banning you for a temporary period.
<otakon> All they went through for that
<OtakuTom> I'm moving! I'm closing on a house in the next 40-50 days!
<Shizuka> 13But if you want to be a jackass about it.
<CriticKitten> Several dead, just to really kick us while we're down. Christ.
<OtakuTom> I'm getting my own house!
<sub06905> ;_;
<otakon> OtakuTom: yay! I hate moving though
<SpeccyRush> otakon: this is the part where you stop trying
<weylin|Blarg> I knew I'd have feels at the end of this ;_;
<Yahooz> lol so many of /those/ names
<otakon> SpeccyRush: too late he's gone
<Jmo> Wait
<Jmo> Wasn't that Sato?
<otakon> Sato?

<Buytoast> went down with his ship?
<Yahooz> I thought his vhost was element.of.failure
<jcelios> GLORIEOUS!
<trixie_sprinkle> he got hurt too, he spat blood
<Starlight_Phoenix> what was the point in ending the movie like that?
<Jmo> I dunno, I knew it was element of something
<SpadeKyurem[School]> My god the new youtube layout looks like crap
<CriticKitten> "Glorifies sub warfare", eh?
<SpeccyRush> War... is hell
<Polydunami> War, Starlight_Phoenix
<Jmo> Ah yeah you're right Yahooz
<CriticKitten> That was depressing as hell. But a damn good movie. Thanks for sharing, Shizu. :3

<Midnight_Fyre> It ended like a WWI movie
<wipergone2> thx Shizuka
<Yahooz> Jmo: yeah this was some idiot from bronymusic
<Starlight_Phoenix> that is a very deep ending
<SkunkTauri> that is some serious bad luck
<Jmo> Lawl
<Midnight_Fyre> Because every WWI movie has a depressing ending
<klobb> thanks for showing this Shizuka

<SkunkTauri> Polydunami: oh?, it seems jaymo is purposely annoying him to get a reaction
<Shizuka> 13XAX|BrackFlops2: well tbf you can fit in at most channels if you just lurk for a while before jumping into conversation
<Jaymo> I'm not trying to annoy him.

<NocturnalBlade> do you
<SkunkTauri> do you?
<XAX|BrackFlops2> MakerDusk: I haven't been in there that often, though.

<XAX|BrackFlops2> Shizuka: Fair point, madame.
<Jaymo> I really do.
<otakon> Sumica: actually Guybrush DOES sound like you a bit
<AJIsHaunter> Jaymo: By telling him to change his name into something specific that got someone in trouble recently?
<Jaymo> That was yesterday.
<MakerDusk> XAX|BrackFlops2: same with me: it's well moderated, so an admin isn't usually needed
<SkunkTauri> he doesnt want to talk to you, so just stop
<AJIsHaunter> Jaymo: Regardless.
<SkunkTauri> ok?
<Jaymo> Regardless my ass.
<otakon> lol

<AJIsHaunter> otakon: It did for me.
<Shizuka> 13yeah he's resetting since we're behind
<Jaymo> So therefore it doesn't matter.
<Polydunami> Sumica said the stream was far behind
<otakon> Shizuka: oh
<Jaymo> Quit trying sprinkle.
<otakon> Shizuka: I thought it was just me
<Jaymo> It is worthless and pathetic.
<Polydunami> I had to refresh at times so that I could keep up
<Shizuka> 13oh maybe that's it, i never have fmle minimized while live

<otakon> AND WE'RE BACK
<Shizuka> 13resumed now
<Jaymo> Na.
<AJIsHaunter> Jaymo: But the fact that you tried to make him do something bannable must be put into consideration as well.
<Jaymo> I really don't feel like it.
<Shizuka> 13settle down guys and watch the classic classic game
<AJIsHaunter> ^
<blixie_sprinkle> what eyjey said
<otakon> I am
<Jmo> He asked what happens when you change your name to it, I simply told him to go ahead and try it.
<SpeccyRush> cept it's not bannable anymore
<Jmo> I didn't force him.
<otakon> AMATEURS
<Jmo> And that.
<Jmo> So therefore I'm not in the wrong.
<Polydunami> I remember that
<Shizuka> 13ama-ters? you pronounce the "t" like a "ch"
<Jmo> I just simply told him he could do that.
<otakon> Jmo: dude, just move ON
<Jmo> Tell these tossers to move on, they're continuing it.
<Shizuka> 13speaking of would that mean "amateur" is descended from french or something?
<MakerDusk> 8,05jmo: let it drop, everyone else: stop feeding the troll and let it drop
<SpeccyRush> otakon: this is the part where you stop trying
<blixie_sprinkle> SpeccyRush: a guy with that name got banned yesterday, had he changed his name he couldve gotten klined by accident
<otakon> Jmo: you're worse than I am at the moment when it comes to being stubborn

<otakon> MakerDusk: he's not a troll, he's an aussie
<Yahooz> herdminnnnnnd
<blixie_sprinkle> SpeccyRush: but the point is that if he changed his name to it, he couldve been banned because they would think its him again
<Yahooz> LOL

<geeky-egg> AFK
<KrazyNoobs> ҉҉
<Kencolt> KrazyNoobs: Monkey Island, quite a while ago, and it was quite a success.
<MysteryMare> KrazyNoobs: What's wrong with clopperS? I'm a clopper. So what. It's my damn life and I'll live it however I like to. I don't see how masturbating to a pony is any different than watching porn or something. I'm not a pedophile I just have different sexual interests. Why shouldn't I do what makes me feel good?
<Buytoast> welp
<soulrider95> lol textwall
<KrazyNoobs> I never said anything about cloppers... today, that is...
<Shizuka> 13MysteryMare: Not appropriate. At all.
<geeky-egg> GALDOLF
<KrazyNoobs> It was 4 days ago I even mentioned cloppers, Kencolt.
<KrazyNoobs> SORRY KENCOLT, I mean MysteryMare
<MysteryMare> KrazyNoobs: Wrong person. Sorry.
<Shizuka> 13hey sumi
<Shizuka> 13i think none shall pass
<Shizuka> 13dunno where i get this idea though
<MysteryMare> Shizuka: I know it's not appropriate. But I'm just so damn sick of people getting into my OWN DAMN PERSONAL BUSINESS!
<KrazyNoobs> MysteryMare: AWWWWWKWAAAAAAA҉AAAAAR҉D
<Kencolt> Um... there was a stuffed something in the church that was one of the things he mentioned.
<Shizuka> 13then don't share your personal business, and ignore them when they want to pry
<geeky-egg> pass
<Sylandest> ^
<Shizuka> 13heeeeeey he wasn't a real troll
<soulrider95> I love having strep throat :<
<geeky-egg> hes a jedi
<Buytoast> a red herring
<Buytoast> oh man
<Buytoast> i like this
<trixie_sprinkle> jedi trolls
<TrixieMuffin> thatmakeshim even moreof a troll
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dat Grog sing
<geeky-egg> soulrider95: yay im not the only sick person
<Shizuka> 13"previously owned"
<SirGanjalf> mmmm Grog
<Shizuka> 13== stolen
<soulrider95> And when I'm sick I can't fall asleep :(
<MysteryMare> KrazyNoobs: I apologize to you Noobs
<geeky-egg> i dont sleep alt all
<KrazyNoobs> I can see that this game, to be successful, had to be made somehwere in that time, because nobody knew what a great game was (although NES and SNES were around, so I am a little confused)... If it were in this era that the game was created, it would have lost money instead of gained it, but, if it was made in the 90s, it probably was cutting-edge for its time.
<geeky-egg> teax wall
<trixie_sprinkle> soulrider95: hm theres stuff you can buy to help you sleep if sickness is getting in the way
<Saturn> 08,01any vegetarians in?
<KrazyNoobs> Thanks MysteryMare, apology accepted. I tolerate cloppers, so I was confused
<MysteryMare> KrazyNoobs: ;)
<soulrider95> KrazyNoobs: This is back when good games were made..... and this is a wonderful game...
<Shizuka> 13i'm a humanitarian
<SirGanjalf> Honest way? Guybrush, you're a pirate, don't you remember?
<MysteryMare> Shizuka: You eat people
<Shizuka> 13well duh
<Shizuka> 13i'm a purple people eater
<geeky-egg> MysteryMare: you dont
<MysteryMare> Lol
<KrazyNoobs> soulrider95 I never played it, so I don't know. I probably won't play it, but if you say it's a wonderful game, I'll believe you. My favourite games were in the 90s
<MysteryMare> geeky-egg: Only on the sabbath.
<geeky-egg> MysteryMare: lol
<TrixieMuffin> one eyed , one horned , flying purple peopleeater ?
<soulrider95> Though we all know the best game ever made was super metroid soooooooooooooooo
<Saturn> 08,01have any of you ever had textured vegetable protein chunks?
<J_E_Smith71> Grog must be the Coke of this world
<geeky-egg> VIKING
<Saturn> 08,01they're generally dry and you add water
*Saturn 08,01uses them in curry sometimes
<soulrider95> Saturn: I did once, it was ok
<Saturn> 08,01i just ate some
<MysteryMare> Textured...protein chunks...
*geeky-egg eats only bacon and souls
<KrazyNoobs> Saturn dat coloured RP
<SirGanjalf> sounds delicious>_>
*AdamTheDuck only eats other ducks .-.
<Saturn> 08,01i discovered my parents still had some left over from when i was last a vegetarian (5 years ago)
<soulrider95> Saturn: went over to my sisters house and she is a vegan so I had to try some different food lol
<trixie_sprinkle> AdamTheDuck: you monster! D:
<SirGanjalf> balls extra
<Alchemist> oh my gawd!! Monkey Island!!!
<Saturn> 08,01KrazyNoobs: RP?
<geeky-egg> pirots arnt polite
<MysteryMare> I think I'm going to have an involuntary protein spill.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> -> /me does not always imply RP
<KrazyNoobs> I love it when that "italic text with /me before it" is coloured, because of the use of it by an admin.
<geeky-egg> ADDD
*KrazyNoobs still likes white RP
*J_E_Smith71 hit his head on keyboard
<Saturn> 08,01KrazyNoobs: it's called action text
<J_E_Smith71> Oh so that's how you do it
<KrazyNoobs> Ah, okay. I thought it was RP. Are RP and "action text" the same thing?
<Shizuka> 13lol
<Shizuka> 13that persuasion
<soulrider95> I could be a vegetarian if I wanted to, but vegan? no way.
<trixie_sprinkle> its not KrazyNoobs
<KrazyNoobs> What is RP then?
<SirGanjalf> role play
<soulrider95> I love egg drop soup waaaaaayyyy too much
<trixie_sprinkle> KrazyNoobs: the act of roleplaying
<KrazyNoobs> Let me guess... is google a friend at this point of time?
<trixie_sprinkle> KrazyNoobs: /me is ften used as rp, but not necessarily
<geeky-egg> ok then
<SirGanjalf> How appropriate, You fight like a cow!
<TrixieMuffin> Insult swordfighting , best ever
<KrazyNoobs> trixie_sprinkle: So RP is a sub-use of action text... okay
<SirGanjalf> DA MACHINE
*KrazyNoobs is happy that "action text" is not bannable.
<trixie_sprinkle> KrazyNoobs: well no, rp is the act of roleplaying,/ me is just /me, roleplaying doesnt have to be /me
<geeky-egg> monky
<taoumi> comeat me bro
<SirGanjalf> :D
<AJIsHaunter> KrazyNoobs: Actually, it is if you useruse it. It can be considered spam.
<Shizuka> 13HO HAHA DODGE TURN PARRY
<KrazyNoobs> trixie_sprinkle: but people normally use action text for RP, as I see most of the time. Thanks everypony
<AJIsHaunter> *overuse

<geeky-egg> 0_0
<taoumi> :D
<KrazyNoobs> AJIsHaunter: Just like sym҉bols... okay

<Shizuka> 13HOW APPROPRIATE
<SirGanjalf> How appropriate, you fight like a cow
<Shizuka> 13YOU FIGHT LIKE A COW
<KrazyNoobs> or Zalgo. I think Zalgo (where it covers other people's text) should be banned. I hate Zalgo, but when used appropriately, ҉ the ҉resul҉t can be interesting
<geeky-egg> moo
<KrazyNoobs> meep
<TrixieMuffin> how apropriate , you fight like a cow
<SirGanjalf> I am rubber

<KrazyNoobs> I know, I was just making a rude comment.
<Shizuka> 13KrazyNoobs: nah, zalgo text just wreaks havoc on text rendering
<KrazyNoobs> Okay, but I'll still stop if it is looked down upon here.

<Shizuka> 13danke sehr
<KrazyNoobs> http://eeemo.net/ don't bring any of that here, please, but in that link are your answers

<KrazyNoobs> trixie_sprinkle: ZALGO is just the excessive use of these characters that are added onto regular letters, such as accent-e or stuff like that. Accented letters are normally regarded to as one character, but really, they are 2 bites, and therefore, have two characters. If you were to take that character, its function is to go above whatever it is ordered, to. on http://eeemo.net/ if you click Toggle Reference Sheet, they have a list of these charact

<thegt90> any one else get far cry 3
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: Sumica.
<weylin|Blarg> I gotta head out. See you guys later for movie night!
<Kandarihu> Gee, I told someone that it was Sumica streaming, only because I thought I heard his voice at the beginning.
*Kandarihu slaps himself around a bit with a VERY large Seapony.

<SuperBrony64> 11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: What is it again?
<CrystalPhoenix> aniderp|bestcakeever, 0533-4023-7036 is mine
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Query,
<SuperBrony64> 11,02?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i didnt put the @ sign in front..
<MadSurge> Sumica: you did pretty well at Monkey Island :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sumica: I can PC game ;3;
<Kandarihu> Speaking of Movie night, my mother wants to vote in the lottery even though she doesn't use the IRC.
<CrystalPhoenix> aniderp|bestcakeever, you can query yours to me~
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im making gyro mii now
<Meanwhile> Don't be silly Super, you can't play big boy games, that's why you have a Wii.
<Sumica> 00,10Then she needs to sign up for newsletter like every one else
<CrystalPhoenix> SuperBrony64, prove it
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 moo
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: what games do you like (or not hate)?
<Kandarihu> Sumica, alright then. Cool. I was wondering if it would be okay for her to refer to herself as Kandarihu's mother, though. She wants to go by the handle she uses on Yahoo.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02;3;
<Meanwhile> Well at the moment I'm having fun with Planetside 2.
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 i astol your beer
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: I c, that game looks fun
<Meanwhile> It's free if you want to give it a go.
<Sumica> 00,10Dont realy matter what she calls her self
<CrystalPhoenix> to me PLanetside 2 looks like any other FPS
<Kandarihu> Alright. I'm just worried that she'll go by a nick that nobody recognizes, and everyone will ask "who's this person who picked this movie"?
<Sumica> 00,10well you realy cant change much in an FPS with out changing it away from an FPS
<Meanwhile> If you mean you have guns and you shoot people then yeah it's exactly like ever other fps.
<Meanwhile> Your insight is truly astounding.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hold on i will get my fc again
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, for someone like me, Planetside 2 is even more different than it is for you. It just takes me to a web page saying Error Code G25. So no PS2 for me.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> who was the other person who wanted me to add?
<Meanwhile> That blows.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> CrystalPhoenix: what is yours?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> you wanted me to add?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> SuperBrony64: you there?
<JRP2234> mica
<JRP2234> can you play me1?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ;_;
<Kandarihu> Sumica, the genre isn't really that narrow. It's gone through an amazing level of evolution since Castle Wolfenstein. Pretty much the only thing that's the same is that you're seeing everything from the characters eyes while shooting stuff, usually (but not always) enemies.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: You going to give it to me?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i pm'd to you o.O

<incog> yes, hello

<CrystalPhoenix> anyway gotta go
<CrystalPhoenix> I've had enough of oz for the morning and I have a job to go to
<Ninjazz> Have fun.
<CrystalPhoenix> good bye everyone
<KrazyNoobs> WHERE IS EVERYPONY!?
<KrazyNoobs> I'm lonely... :'(
<Ninjazz> Thanks for that bit of information.
<KrazyNoobs> Yay, somepony's online!
<KrazyNoobs> Wow... I have a part of this to myself.
<KrazyNoobs> ...
<KrazyNoobs> D̶O̶ ̶ A̶L̶L̶ ̶ T̶H̶E̶ ̶ Z̶A̶L̶G̶O̶!̶ Follow the rules. :)
<KrazyNoobs> That was meant to be crossed out, showing I wasn't going to do that.
<KrazyNoobs> Who am I talking to?
<KrazyNoobs> :[
<aniderp|bestcakeever> Gold_Demona: still here?
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Eeyup
<Gold_Demona> Just lurkin'
<aniderp|bestcakeever> sea ponies!
<aniderp|bestcakeever> speaking of..
<KrazyNoobs> YAY!!! REAL PEOPLE
*aniderp|bestcakeever grabs someone to dance to sea ponies
<KrazyNoobs> 5
<KrazyNoobs> Sea ponies ftw
<KrazyNoobs> I would have to admit, if sea ponies were ressurected, they should make it more of an epic episode than a marketing scheme.
<Kandarihu> KrazyNoobs, I hope it doesn't happen in the cartoon.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I went for Snivy again, he served me well in the other game :D he's "Sir Lagart" this time :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Awesome =)
<Gold_Demona> I like Snivey. He's cool.
<Gold_Demona> But I have a special place in my heart for Bacon. :>
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: none of the g5 starters are really lame :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: The only one I have a problem with is Oshawott, because his design had a HORRIBLE first impression on me.
<KrazyNoobs> Kandarihu They should at least make them awesome if they did do that.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D well at least he becomes a samurai ocelot :D
<KrazyNoobs> Talking about Pokemon, ay?
<Gold_Demona> My first thought was that he looked like one of those squeaky clown toys.
<Gold_Demona> samurai ocelot? >.>
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D were there any clown mons now that I think of it?
<Gold_Demona> Mr. Mime
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: mimes and clowns are not the same :D
<Gold_Demona> A mime is a type of clown
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the last evolution of Oshawott looks like it's wearing a samurai armor
<MadSurge> *u
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah, but I'm not seeing the "ocelot" part...
<KrazyNoobs> Gold_Demona Sorry to butt in to your conversation, but Oshawott, in my opinion, is the best starter, because Samurott is strong, relatively quick (base speed of 80) and has a wide range of moves. (I hate Serperior because of it's small range of moves, knowing Normal, Grass, two Poison attacking moves and one Dragon (Dragon Tail, lame move). Emboar is slow. Everyone has different opinions, but, if I have the chance, Oshawott is my first pick.
<Gold_Demona> It doesn't look like a cat...
<RoboGerbil> !cd
<Tom> Episode 6 of season 3 "Sleepless in Ponyville" airs in 1 days, 2 hours, 53 minutes, 37 seconds (Dec 08 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<Gold_Demona> KrazyNoobs: AAHH!!!
<Socks> Hi every pony :)
<KrazyNoobs> Hi Socks
<MadSurge> KrazyNoobs: I want quickness, therefore Snivy is my choice. :D
<Gold_Demona> Holy textwall, Batman!
<Socks> What is the discussion of choice today? :P
<KrazyNoobs> And that's a good choice too, I just prefer Oshawott. As stated by me previously, everyone has different opinions, and in some cases, Serperior can be helpful if you are versing Rock, Water and Ground types.
<KrazyNoobs> I like the visual design of Generation 5 starters, but not the moves and stats so much.
<Gold_Demona> Statwise all the starters are really good in their own right. I usually just go with the one I like the most personally.
<Gold_Demona> I'm usually not after a specific stat, so long as it's strong in the stat they're best at.
<Gold_Demona> Oshawott has grown on me as I've seen more pictures of it, particularly from the anime. It was just that first impression that put me off. =/
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yeah really. I give no crap about metagame, I like Snivy because he's smug :3
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> I like Treecko in gen 3 for the same reason. XD
<KrazyNoobs> Gold_Demona I used to do that before I became mad with EV Training, IV breeding and Move Selecting, sometimes breeding with moves. Have you ever tried to get Snatch in a Druddigon? It took me excessive hours of gameplay to get it to know it. Before I did this, I followed my heart, and did want I wanted to do. Obsessing over the EVs and crap like that has made the game, somewhat, less enjoyable, so I see where you are coming from. If you want to fol
<Gold_Demona> KrazyNoobs: AH!!! Again with the giant wall of text!!!
<RoboGerbil> wow dat wall
<Gold_Demona> tl;dr version?
<KrazyNoobs> I like Charmander from Gen 1, Totodile from Gen 2, Treecko from Gen 3, Chimchar from Gen 4 and Snivy from Gen 5 by personal choice.
<KrazyNoobs> I love walls.
<Gold_Demona> KrazyNoobs: Gens 1 through 4 are exactly the same for me. :D
<KrazyNoobs> My fav Gen 5 Pokemon is Mienshao. HUGE attack, HUGE speed, it's perfect.
<Bronysith> http://www.fimfiction-static.net/images/story_images/68142.png?1354783344 have some ponies in socks
<Gold_Demona> My faves from Gen 5 are Archeops, Krookodile, and the electric spider that evolves from Joltik. :>
<Gold_Demona> Which is rare, because I'm not fond of most bug types.
<KrazyNoobs> *WALL OF TEXT, LOL* Gold_Demona: Awesome. I actually liked none of the Gen 3 Pokemon when they were first shown, but I liked Treecko. I also only thought Snivy was cool after they revealed the silhouttes, but then after more offical information was released, I liked Oshawott. Tepig still doesn't work out well for me.
<RoboGerbil> scyther is best bug
<Gold_Demona> Scizzor is better :>
<KrazyNoobs> Accelgor is best bug
<RoboGerbil> dead is best bug
<KrazyNoobs> No, sorry, DURANT is best bug.
<KrazyNoobs> RoboGerbil: You made me laugh, congratulations.
<KrazyNoobs> Anypony else like Mienshao?
<Gold_Demona> I think out of thre three gen 5 starters, The pig is the cutest in first form, but as far as the higher forms, I'm not impressed with any of them. =/
<Gold_Demona> designwise I mean
<Gold_Demona> Mienshao's the one that looks like "Ninja Winnie the Pooh" right?
<KrazyNoobs> Anypony else like Mienshao?
<Gold_Demona> Or is that the other one...
<Gold_Demona> Oh wait, no. That's Mienfu
<Gold_Demona> Mienfu is Ninja Pooh
<KrazyNoobs> Gold_Demona http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mienshao_(Pok%C3%A9mon)
<RoboGerbil> when i played i always liked growlithe, vaporeon, geodude, alakazam then whatever 2 else i find
<Gold_Demona> Ok, yeah. Mienshao is the evolved form
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, that one looks cool
<KrazyNoobs> Alakazam and Arcanine are my fav. non-legendary non-psuedo-legendary Gen 1 Pokemon, stat-wise.
<KrazyNoobs> Dragonite is best Gen 1
<RoboGerbil> dragonites pretty hard to find
<RoboGerbil> but those 4 would carry me through the 8 gyms
<Gold_Demona> I was thinking of Mienfoo. ^^;
<KrazyNoobs> You cannot find Dragonite in the wild. You can buy Dratini at the Gaming Corner in Gen 1 for 700 coins.
<Gold_Demona> Or try to fish for one in the Safari zone. :D
<KrazyNoobs> You can find Dragonite at the Dragonspiral Tower on 4F at a 1% chance at level 50 - 60, though
<KrazyNoobs> in Pokemon Black and White 2
<Gold_Demona> I don't like catching pokemon already evolved. =/
<RoboGerbil> i hvant played the gen 5's
<Gold_Demona> I like getting them in their first forms and raising them up myself. :>
<KrazyNoobs> I catch them at any stage, I breed them, get the right nature, right IVs, and then I EV train them to their maximum potiential.
<RoboGerbil> thats way too involved
<Gold_Demona> I don't like breeding. Mostly because I don't like starting over on a pokemon I've already trained.
<MadSurge> ^
<KrazyNoobs> I won FIRST in the Autumn Tournament for Pokemon Black and White in 2010, with the name, TATTERS.
<KrazyNoobs> Thanks to EV training. It is really helpful
<RoboGerbil> congrats, you have no life outside of pokemon...
<KrazyNoobs> RoboGerbil I have a degree in Marine Biology, and a job maintaining and designing the tanks at UnderWater World Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia. Is that not enough?
<Gold_Demona> EV training is too tedious for me. I'd rather just play.
<RoboGerbil> KrazyNoobs: wow you mastered the pokemon breeding in fishtanks too? /troll
<KrazyNoobs> Sometimes, I download ROMS, and don't even bother EV Training. The lack of EV training reminds me of when I was a kid, aimlessly playing these games. It was so much fun!
<KrazyNoobs> To be honest, EV training sometimes sucks the fun out of everything.
<Gold_Demona> I wouldn't say it's aimless. I aim to beat the game. =P
<Gold_Demona> And then I don't really care after that.
<RoboGerbil> pfft and how do you know when you beat it?
<KrazyNoobs> Aimless as in training the Pokemon PERFECTLy, just catching random ones, using legendaries against the Elite Four. Sometimes, that is fun.
<RoboGerbil> is your defenition of beat when the credits roll? cuz in gen 4-5 thats just the first half
<KrazyNoobs> When HeartGold and SoulSilver came out, I bought both, I played HG seriously, and SS, I just messed around. It was fun.
<Gold_Demona> I never use legendaries.
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YME40ObCkVI
<KrazyNoobs> I use legendaries when I am messing around, but I train my team properly when not. My Gen 5 B2W2 team is Mienshao, Krookodile, Haxorus, Cinccino, Starmie and Crobat.
<Gold_Demona> Suddenly random irrelevant link
<Meanwhile> I hyper beam everything to death.
<RoboGerbil> lol that random link
<KrazyNoobs> Dafuq was in dat link
<KrazyNoobs> Bronysith Thanks for breaking our conversation, LOL
<RoboGerbil> i think its none piece episode 5
<RoboGerbil> but i cant tell
<KrazyNoobs> Meanwhile I don't use Hyper Beam. It is a special Normal Type, which isn't the best, and you have to recharge, unless you are holding the Saphron Quilt, (that's its japanese name, not sure about English, google is my friend)
<DitzyDerpy15> are those hay bacon strips?
<Meanwhile> KrazyNoobs: I named my red Gyrados HYPERBEAM and then cloned him 5 times.
<Meanwhile> That should give you an example of how I regard pokemon.
<RoboGerbil> here have another random link www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba58GJv9SA4
<DitzyDerpy15> u mean Gyarados
<DitzyDerpy15> ...
<KrazyNoobs> I found one shiny before, and it was a Gyarados in Pokemon Pearl. I was so proud of myself, but when HGSS came out, I was mad.
<Bronysith> more like gayrados
<DitzyDerpy15> heartgold?
<Meanwhile> Gyarados* pardon me.
<RoboGerbil> Meanwhile: call them all guyra
<DitzyDerpy15> soul silver?!
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hm
<Ninjazz> So much pokemon.
<DitzyDerpy15> umg
<Meanwhile> And this was in Gold, before shinies were even a thing.
<KrazyNoobs> PokeState.net
<DitzyDerpy15> HAY BACON STRIPS
<KrazyNoobs> OH YEAH?
<Meanwhile> Yes.
<KrazyNoobs> The prince is having a ball!
<Ninjazz> Doom was my Pokemon. I don't share any of your feelings. ;_;
*DitzyDerpy15 slaps Ninjazz with a steel pipe
<KrazyNoobs> Come on, use Mienshao. Even for fooler-around-ers, it is an awesome Pokemon that is utterly underated.
<Meanwhile> I haven't played any pokemon past Gold, so I really have no idea.
<SpeccyRush> Meanwhile: shinies were a thing in the original gold and silver
<DitzyDerpy15> "Flutterlu Underated"
<DitzyDerpy15> Flutterly*
<KrazyNoobs> BEST POKEMON in my opinion (non-legendary, non-psuedo-legendary): Gen 1: Alakazam
<RoboGerbil> make a team of all subsonic users
<Meanwhile> SpeccyRush: There was like, one red Gyarados. Which I had.
<KrazyNoobs> Gen2: Crobat
<KrazyNoobs> Gen 3: Milotic
<Ponies47> Bye everypony~
<KrazyNoobs> Gen 4: Floatzel
<Scoot-Scootaloo> One of us is missing...
<KrazyNoobs> Gen 5: Mienshao
<KrazyNoobs> @ChickenCall who is it?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> And KrazyNoobs, stop naming worst pokemon!
<KrazyNoobs> :(
<GhostColt> what we all doing>
<DitzyDerpy15> idk
<valoreins> >.>
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Seriosly, Meinshoa can go eat a dick >: (
<valoreins> <.<
<valoreins> hello :3
<DitzyDerpy15> The 7 Flaws of TomSKa made me cry T_T
<GhostColt> sup
<SpeccyRush> Meanwhile: yeah, but gen 2 was when shinys were introduced, there was the gyarados which was always shiny there was that egg from the daycare people which had a 50% chance of being shiny when hatched and then there was the 1 in 8142 or so chance of any wild pokemon you encountered being shiny
<RoboGerbil> why havnt i seen this yet... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM5lg0xv3gk
<KrazyNoobs> It sucks when an admin says that, and you cannot argue back. :'(
<Meanwhile> SpeccyRush: Consider my 14 year old self educated.
<GhostColt> jolteon is no.1 pokemon
<KrazyNoobs> Jolteon is pretty good, but Vaporean is best Gen 1 Eevolution
<KrazyNoobs> *Vaporeon
<GhostColt> both epic
<Bronysith> all eeves suck
<DitzyDerpy15> Guys i think im the youngest here cuz im 11 years old :P
<DitzyDerpy15> XD
<KrazyNoobs> Espeon is best Eevolution, stat-wise
<GhostColt> jolteon has an epic lvl of speed and damage
<Bronysith> DitzyDerpy15 well you arent supposed to be here
<DitzyDerpy15> I like ponies dude
<GhostColt> vapouron epic health and 2 epic passives
<RoboGerbil> leafeon is junk, never make one
<KrazyNoobs> DitzyDerpy15 Don't admit that here, you'll get kicked for 3 years. T_T
<Meanwhile> If you're 11 you're too young to be in this chat.
<Meanwhile> Begone.
<KrazyNoobs> 14 is the "legal" age
<DitzyDerpy15> so i cant watch livestreams T_T
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Why can't you be like everyone else and lie about your age?
<Bronysith> DitzyDerpy15: get the fuck out
<Jmo> If the legal age was enforced several people here would be kicked.
<KrazyNoobs> You can watch live-streams, the chat is just restricted
<DitzyDerpy15> dah gotta head back to something else
<KrazyNoobs> DitzyDerpy15: Just change your username, and start fresh
<DitzyDerpy15> good bye
<KrazyNoobs> bye, DitzyDerpy15, have a good one. :'(
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Aww look, now you done scared him away from this chat... we could of aught him things...
<Gold_Demona> My favorites are as follows: Gen1: Machamp, Gen2: Tyranitar, Gen3: Walrein, Gen4: Infernape, Gen5: Archeops
<Scoot-Scootaloo> >Archeops
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Get out.
<KrazyNoobs> Archeops is awesome
<Meanwhile> Scoot-Scootaloo you are a bad person and you should feel bad.
<KrazyNoobs> Damn, admin disagrees, *goes into hiding mode*
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Meanwhile: Says the cynical bastard<3
<Meanwhile> I'm required to by laws of cynicism.
<Ninjazz> You're both bad persons.
<Gold_Demona> Archeopteryx was always one of my favorite prehistoric "birds", and I was so happy when they came out with a pokemon of it. :D
<Bronysith> well Meanwhile is pretty much the worst person ever
<Meanwhile> people*
<Ninjazz> I know what I said.
<RoboGerbil> best derpy evar http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xtC5S_tza4
<valoreins|Drawing> what happen to the youtube layout..?
<Jmo> Allo Snow
<KrazyNoobs> Archeops is a good Pokemon, the highest in base total of any non-legendary. Did you know that the Base Stat Total of Archeops (567) is the same as its National Pokedex number? Your argument is invalid.
<Bronysith> valoreins|Drawing: it is now shit again
<valoreins|Drawing> dang it
<Snow> haxorus ftw
<Meanwhile> I don't even know what Archeops is.
<Gold_Demona> KrazyNoobs: That's awesome :D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> KrazyNoobs: If ONLY it wasn't screwed over by its ability
<GhostColt> anyone here played on pokemon showdown?
<Snow> highest attack stat off all
<Gold_Demona> Scoot-Scootaloo: I know! That's the only thing I don't like about it! D:
<Snow> Scoot-Scootaloo: id rather have a haxorus :P
<Gold_Demona> It has a really crappy ability. Why do they even MAKE abilities like this? >_<
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64
<GhostColt> http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/lobby
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Now then... tests ahoy
<MadSurge> Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> EWWWW youtube layout :|
<KrazyNoobs> @Scoot-Scootaloo: I was just about to mention that ability... that is what brings it down, but it's base speed of 110 combined with it's amazing attack can make a good first-hit on an opponent... but really, it is no long-lasting Pokemon, so I see where you are coming from, Scoot-Scootaloo
<FmL|DarkBlade15> fml pokemon
<pony_3045> streamstuck?
<Gold_Demona> It's the only reason I don't actually have an Archeops on my team. :<

<KrazyNoobs> Shoop da whoo-BAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<HavokPhone> Ohai
<Dark92Enigma-> IMA FIRING MAH LAZOR
<Dark92Enigma-> BOOOOOOOOM
<HavokPhone> How's everyone doing? :P
<Dark92Enigma-> I <3 THIS SHOW WHEN I WAS A KID
<KrazyNoobs> doing gine, HavokPhone
<Suzano> i still love it :D
<KrazyNoobs> Dark92Enigma same here
<KrazyNoobs> I miss this
<Kandarihu> I loved this show when it was fresh. I don't think it really aged well, though.
<KrazyNoobs> Just like Spongebob. Season 1 and 2 were awesome, a movie was made, and then the new Spongie is complete bs
<KrazyNoobs> HONESTY... AJ, is that you?
<Suzano> there was a BRONY!
<Suzano> :O
<Dark92Enigma-> KrazyNoobs: IMO all 3 seasons were awesome, the movie was awesome, and mostly everything related to Spongebob is BS
<Dark92Enigma-> SFTER THAT
<Dark92Enigma-> AFTER*
<Dark92Enigma-> (right now)
<Dark92Enigma-> KrazyNoobs: i dunno if you get the idea
<KrazyNoobs> The movie was crap in my opinion, it didn't make me laugh, and it was more geared towards 6 year olds than the entire family. I loved before the movie though. One of the most brilliant moments in animation history
<Gold_Demona> lol the Tick towers over everybody. XD
<Kandarihu> I never saw the movie of this.
<MadSurge> Hey, it's this show I never saw!
<KrazyNoobs> Plus, I miss Spongebob Squarepants's old character. He was a confident and hardworking sponge. In the new spongebob, he is just a mindless and stupid character who, on accident but way too constant, wrecks Squidward's life.
<Gold_Demona> Eww
<KrazyNoobs> dat rod
*aniderp|bestcakeever cries
<KrazyNoobs> d--do went into the hole
<MadSurge> ADVENTURE
<KrazyNoobs> TIME
<KrazyNoobs> *finntrollface.png*
<KrazyNoobs> This animation reminds me of the Angry Beavers
<MadSurge> Well, do I need to know anything about this show?
<Bronysith> NAH REALLY?!
<Arcium> whuuuuuut is this ? o.O
<KrazyNoobs> The Tick
<MadSurge> It's the Pyro union!
<MadSurge> :D
<Arcium> xD
<KrazyNoobs> An old retro show that is rarely shown anymore
<Gold_Demona> lol They even talk like Pyro XD
<KrazyNoobs> mmmmmmmmmmfp hfhp hfp hphfphfphfhf m
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: that's right :D
<Gold_Demona> Oh no! Plaid! My one weakness! DX
<Arcium> is it allowed to use the w#f (t) word?
<Dark92Enigma-> KrazyNoobs: well granted the movie isn't as funny as the series. but i lked the message they were going for
<valoreins|Drawing> pyro fused with spy
<MadSurge> Arcium: we're adults, we won't be scandalized :D
<KrazyNoobs> The message was, "No, I'm the greates manager in the WOOOOOORLD"
<Gold_Demona> Time to play episode backwards?
<Dark92Enigma-> BACKWAAAAAAAAAAAARDS
<Arcium> :DD
<MadSurge> YAAAY BACKWARDS SONG :D
<KrazyNoobs> yay
<KrazyNoobs> vagipony
<Dark92Enigma-> Is there somekind of subliminal message?
<Dark92Enigma-> some kind*
<Gold_Demona> KrazyNoobs: ...wut?
<KrazyNoobs> TF2 reference
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Dark92Enigma-: If you listen closely, you'll here "Cheers to my sweet Satan"
<Gold_Demona> Subliminal message: "Kill your family!"
<valoreins|Drawing> ^
<KrazyNoobs> Fluttershy said, "Brainwash adults with cuteness"
<KrazyNoobs> isnerfnerf
<MadSurge> "fuck this girls, the situation is hopeless, we're getting every spoil we can and then run away!"
<Kandarihu> It's backwards, so it's about destroying the Crystal Empire by distorting their history.
<KrazyNoobs> sounds like Japanese
<Rose`Kitty> oh god
<Rose`Kitty> the tick
<MadSurge> "the Babbling Criminals" :D
<Arcium> o.o
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Rose`Kitty: You got a PROBLEM with that? >: (
<MadSurge> HA, mayor Blank :D
<KrazyNoobs> The Tick was part of my childhood, f--- you Rose'Kitty
<Dark92Enigma-> KrazyNoobs: lol...no, when SB was about to lose, he said: ''you are what you are, and nothing can change it......but that's ok because i've done what other kid couldn't do'' yeah, you're right :D
<MadSurge> :O NOT CLOWNS
*aniderp|bestcakeever cries in the corner
*Dark92Enigma- hugs aniderp|bestcakeever
<Dark92Enigma-> don't cry
<Rose`Kitty> batch, did i not add a smiley face, Scoot-Scootaloo?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Nope
<Rose`Kitty> oh, okay then
<Kandarihu> Naturally, the only thing he has that transforms is his sofa. And it transforms into a bed.
<Snow> HUG DESTINY

<KrazyNoobs> I wonder what's for dinner
<Gold_Demona> And then Arthur died.
<KrazyNoobs> Mah Boi, this peace is what ALL true warriors strive for.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> and then aniderp jumped off a cliff
<valoreins|Drawing> i have a tendency to change mood swiftly
<valoreins|Drawing> and i may be a bipolar

<Rose`Kitty> this looks like a job for Rose`
<Dark92Enigma-> with MAIND instead of MADE
<Dark92Enigma-> maid*
<Gold_Demona> lol Punisher wannabe
<Dark92Enigma-> PUNISHER much?
<Dark92Enigma-> lol
<KrazyNoobs> THAT'S RACIST
<Snow> get the snipers!
<Kandarihu> You can tell the super heroes who were created as jokes and the ones who were made as actual characters. Der Fladermaus and American Maid are in the clips opening. We'll be seeing more of them.
<Dark92Enigma-> i love all of the superhero parodies in this show
<KrazyNoobs> dat rapeface
<Rose`Kitty> that grin

<RoboGerbil> this is a plot based show
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Why can't there be a Tick fandom...
<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma-, the proper term is nigh-invulnerable.
<Snow> lolled
<RoboGerbil> Scoot-Scootaloo: there used to be but that shows like 20 years old
<Dark92Enigma-> Scoot-Scootaloo: can't we form part of it?
<Rose`Kitty> this looks like a job for Scoot-Scootaloo
<Kandarihu> RoboGerbil, actually, it becomes more episodic for the most part iirc.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Bronytick?
<Gold_Demona> It's a cult fandom. Like Gargoyles. >.>
<KrazyNoobs> Scoot-Scootaloo Fandoms are for media that are currently being generated, and if a show stopped being made a decade or two ago, there is no use in a fandom.
<Bronysith> gargoyles is so meh
<Bronysith> Scoot-Scootaloo: and you get a hug
<Kandarihu> Oh, I love this one.
*Bronysith hugs Scoot-Scootaloo
<pony_3045> OBJECTION!
<KrazyNoobs> objection
<RoboGerbil> why is it so laggy
<Dark92Enigma-> Scoot-Scootaloo: from what i could tell, it still has a cult following to this day
<Scoot-Scootaloo> RoboGerbil: Because ponies
<valoreins|Drawing> to be fair there wasn't enough communication media like we have now to form a Tick fandom decades ago
<pony_3045> thereis pedophile dancing on teh table

<pony_3045> Ropes, Bombs
<KrazyNoobs> guise, I was on /b/... I found some posts about invading brony streams. Will they actually do anything?
<pony_3045> dat Bison
<KrazyNoobs> Really, I'll link the post
<Dark92Enigma-> OF COURSE
<Gold_Demona> Eeyes!
<Dark92Enigma-> ONLY ON THE HUB
<Kandarihu> KrazyNoobs, threads of that nature are among the few things that are not allowed on /b/. I hope you reported those threads.
<pony_3045> MY FACE IS MY SHIED
<KrazyNoobs> Oh, I will report them. They are talking about BronyStream4, and hacking it to enrage /mlp/
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma what have you been up to
<KrazyNoobs> Nothing about BronyState mentioned, though. :)
<Dark92Enigma-> alexxm: been good.......waiting until movie night
<KrazyNoobs> It's already been reported, lol
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma jurrisac park and rat race right?
<MadSurge> alexxm: yep
<Snow> BARRY
<Gold_Demona> BarryBarryBarryBarry
<Snow> at least its not barney
<pony_3045> ..veryveryvery special somepony
<Gold_Demona> BerryBerryBerryBerry
<pony_3045> bombs
<Dark92Enigma-> alexxm: OH YEAH. this is gonna be good
<KrazyNoobs> Will they still do anything? There have been enough hacks already, that Discord one, that wierd dancing brown ball and that little black kid screaming about KFC. I hope those losers stop hacking our streams.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> KrazyNoobs: To them I say: COME AT ME BRO
<Scoot-Scootaloo> They won't do shit~
<Dark92Enigma-> DRIVE SAFELY
<KrazyNoobs> NGAA still says they are at war.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Fuck the GNAA!
<Kandarihu> KrazyNoobs, the only hack I know of was the dancing orange and the IT'S HAPPENING macro.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> err, don't quote me on that..
<RoboGerbil> lol air freshener
<Dark92Enigma-> dat air freshner
*Bronysith carries Scoot-Scootaloo to bed
<Dark92Enigma-> WTF
<Dark92Enigma-> BOOOOOOOOOOM
<RoboGerbil> poor talking dog
<Kandarihu> Sidekick Lounge is expendable.
<Kandarihu> ...then again, it's destruction would mean that the sidekicks are treated with dignity.
<KrazyNoobs> There was a Discord one at the same time as the dancing orange, and on MAgic Duel on this other livestream, BronyStream4, i think it was, a GIF of this little black kid looking happy with KFC edited into the images was played with a really racist rapping song. T_T
<Bronysith> TL;DR
<RoboGerbil> barry isnt rainbow
<KrazyNoobs> Enough talk about hackers, they have no life and they just try to enrage us.
<MadSurge> Don't use Mips, done :D
<KrazyNoobs> wuss necks?
<Dark92Enigma-> KrazyNoobs: just like (most of) the trolls
<Bronysith> holy shit
<Bronysith> THEY DIDNT HACK
<RoboGerbil> http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f66/PhoeKun/taste_the_rainbow_by_atomicfireball-n1298378864290.jpg
<Kandarihu> KrazyNoobs, I see. If it happened two weeks in a row, they'll try again. Let's just see if they can hack USTREAM.
<MadSurge> And we have youtube uploads in an hour anyway, so it's a lost cause :D
<KrazyNoobs> I know, but I want to see it at the time it is released.
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, an hour later isn't live, though.
<[]DeadpoolDash> mister rogers
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: like I care, I come here for the people now :D
<KrazyNoobs> by the way, no spoilers yet for S3E6, i find that wierd. I think they are doing something special for us, and many other bronies think that, while others think that they just want to prevent disappointment... it's odd, really...
<Snow> if thinking makes your mind garden grow
<Snow> it would be a f*cking jungle in my mind
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, if we become dependant on non-live sources, we'll be vulnerable to spoilers.
