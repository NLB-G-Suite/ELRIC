<DerpySparklz> tWILIGHT SINGS IN THE gALA SONG
<Ohfour> Rarity is fashinable and wants to classy and still wants to impress her freinds and high society at the same time, not a flat character
<Jigglysaint> adult men swarm a little girl's facebook page
<Buytoast> It pleases me.
<Colt_of_Personality> They've made several, but they're too expensive :(

<Kencolt> POnyfan78: Samurai Pizza Cats is a dub of the anime, "Kyatto Ninden Teyandee". However, the group that was to dub it-- Saban-- weren't given any tr4anscripts and almost no plots-- just raw footage. So the producer's just made up dialog from nowhere. The result is one of the funniest shows ever.

<Dandelo2> Gotta be really scary to be in space and miss your target...
<kakashi6613> Space... vaccuum.... and...
<K_A> otakon: This is supposed to make sense?
<pikorar> Stupid Carlos.
<Shizuka> 13meanwhile the tides on earth have been destroyed
<Fluttershy_yay> And then they died from improper depressurization...
<Tao-mell> so why the hell are we watching magic school bus?!
<Somebrony> TO THE SUN.
<Yozhel> this is the first time I see this show
<Mark> as well as the expensive looking pod
<Ponyfan78> Suddenly the Bus turns into the Majora's mask moon
<REFUSEDSTONE> and u say somehthing like
<otakon> K_A ofc!
<Fluttershy_yay> :D
<stallion10123> lol?
<kakashi6613> Exactly.
<TOY_PON3> BOB is best planet
<Tenure> And then Princess Celestia wakes up with a black eye
<Kenai> cause mun
<Dandelo2> Lop
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> u mean dead?
<otakon> it's educational!
<TheWattsMan> except they don't, and the asteroid goes back on it's original course
<Stargazer> aren't we all just living space junk when you stop to think about it?
<TopHat> we can't watch pony ALL THE TIME
<Noshame> star trek reference lol
<TheWattsMan> or I'm remembering wrong
<Alister> FUCK THIS SHOW
<MasterBrony> did yall see the MLP ep last week?
<gamemaster257> and then the sun permantely blinded all of them
<SteamingBullet> It is, but they run out of episodes at some point.
<otakon> Tenure: good one
<Tao-mell> YES WE CAN!
<Vinco> are they creating mass?
<firlalaith> Stargazer: true
<Plotbuster> i was about to say that flutty =p
<Phillie> this is very much like a pony show
<Morty|cant_write> stuffing?
<Jim> Stargazer: That's deep
<Phase4> Shizuka: imagine what happens if you slightly screw the moons orbit :P
<B0X0R> its just a button
<Slowter> God dangit Carlos!
<Linkhopper> LOL DEATH JOKE
<kakashi6613> dem windows
<Calycibos> Oh, god, reverse to the moon banishment.

<Ponyfan78> Beam me up scotty
<BRONY> 321
<koolaidguy23> that pun was bad and you should feel bad
<otakon> what did SlurryMoon do?
<Morty|cant_write> who writes this garbage
<Noshame> then star wars
<Ohfour> scotty more power!
<K_A> They used to have a segment at the end where the scientifically questionable plot points were explained, but in the Qubo syndication, it was omitted. :\
<MasterBrony> remember the comment about cider sales keeping the farm afloat during the winter?
<firlalaith> you can create matter
<Buytoast> And then, they got smaller at the wrong time and, instead of the asteroid hitting the school, it hits Earth's ocean, causing many tidal waves and drowning half the populace.
<Vinco> So much for being educational
<Dken2021> sure arnold, why not
<Sus> Best letter to the princess every.
<Tao-mell> who was the one who decided to play magic school bus?
<TheWattsMan> ok, I'm wrong
<Phillie> just remember, love and tolerate, this show is out dated but not broken
<MadCommando> yay:(
<SlurryMoon> 3huh?
<Ponyfan78> WHO CARES
<Sus> ever*
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> oh Nasa
<Equineexcite> And so the sun was DESTROYED
<Sus> Yeah?
<Mark> this is wat happens when you make a show ment solly for young childern at school
<SlurryMoon> 3otakon what?
<stallion10123> YES
<SCIENCE> this is me, not Math!
<Plotbuster> and we're the enterprize again
<Shizuka> 13i am confuse
<REFUSEDSTONE> so wut im asking is
<Fluttershy_yay> <3 the voice crack on "free"
<Dtox> cause you know, it has to go into the sun XD
<red_five> The puns have been doubles
<Morty|cant_write> im tired and cranky
<Ponyfan78> God damn it Nasa
<Sumica> 00,10like nasa could have done a thing
<red_five> doubled
<Colt_of_Personality> I just wish they threw Ralph into the abyss
<REFUSEDSTONE> A NAME FOR THE PROGRAMM
<Segatendo> Meteor got banished, to the SUUUUN!
<Luna> 07,01dat solar flame
<ROBCakeran53> NASA?
<MasterBrony> do they have a mortgage on the farm or something?
<Morty|cant_write> imma go to bed
<REFUSEDSTONE> we have it
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> poof
<WingedCurse> NASA is jelly lol
<Thunderjet> what nasa?
<MasterBrony> they nave no bills
<Somebrony> Would have been funny if they just slingshot the asteroid to the Earth even faster.
<Slowter> Destroy all invaders
<DocSane> Fast moving rock
<REFUSEDSTONE> but no name
<B0X0R> NASA SUCKS!:|
<otakon> SlurryMoon: apparently you did something
<Tao-mell> goodnight!
<Shimmus> woot
<pikorar> Tell them that Carlos did jack shit.
<ncb_LuckyStampede> So, I've never been here all night. Does this continue all night?
<Dtox> that asteroid just hit the sun after a few minutes...
<TOY_PON3> hey SlurryMoon :3
<Alister> It's not becuz you make a show for kids that you don't have to try
<koolaidguy23> awww f**k ansa man
<TopHat> wtf
<TheWattsMan> they've been on hold with NASA for the entire episode
<fredfred99> The point isn't to make sense. It is to teach children about SCIENCE
<MisterTwister> What comes after this?
<Morty|cant_write> night everpony
<Dken2021> nobody care about you SCIENCE, not even MAGIC
<magicman> NASA was upstaged by a childrens bus
<MasterBrony> the are the labor
<Yozhel> now the sun will blow up
<pony_8832> they probably just wiped out a species last chance of survival
<Dandelo2> It must be me, but that Asteroid arrived too fast.
<Tenure> the sun can't fuse iron
<Morty|cant_write> imma go sleep
<kakashi6613> BUT WOULDN'T IT JUST ORBIT THE SUN?????
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> lol
<Dtox> it takes light EIGHT minutes to reach earth
<SlurryMoon> 3what?
<deathfire365> too many flaws
<detour> because fk nasa
<DocSane> 93 million miles in about 30 secs.
<Shizuka> 13yay, the flare caused by the asteroid's destruction will overwhelm the magnetic field!
<Jim> good night Morty|cant_write
<Tao-mell> candy OMNOMNOMNOM!
<otakon> suddenly boxer
<Plotbuster> we finished that shit off in ten seconds flat
<metalpinkiepiechan> is it over yet
<Ohfour> We've already been to saturn. you jelly nasa?
<pony_7849> then the sun leftovers hit earth and we all die from radiation
<emangamer> Shizuka: how did SlurryMoon break the tides on earth?
<Ponyfan78> And thus we killed a bunch of peaceful aliens that was inside the asteroid spaceship
<RainbowKitten> Its too bad, that all of this is just a virtual reality...
<firlalaith> conservation of matter states that matter can be turned into energy
<Fluttershy_yay> Haha! It's funny because nasa actually did things then! :D
<Colt_of_Personality> Science doesn't have to make sense
<DocSane> Meaning it was going about 16c
<BRONY> THE FUN HAS BEEN DOUBLED
<Linkhopper> national assholes shitting anvils = NASA
<RoughBacon> Lol awesome troll: Call NASA and when they pick up tell them you fixed the problem..
<MasterBrony> so how can they lose the farm?
<magicman> Clark kent was on that asteroid
<Cypresswolf> Captain Liz Picard of the U S S Frizzle Bus
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Point of the story: Call Europe to solve our problems instead of rely on the US.
<Noshame> why hasn't Ms. Frizzle been arrested for endangerment of children?
<Sus> Hmm.
<Calycibos> I would slay that lizard and eat his organs.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> ooooooooo
<ncb_LuckyStampede> I normally cut off around 10 and come back for the episode
<Tao-mell> I learned absolutely nothing
<stallion10123> maby idk

<SteamingBullet> you are not alone Tao
<Kencolt> Meanwhile, inside the asteroid, a peaceful society that was about to brake and visit Earth with the secret to eternal peace and prosperity was destroyed.
<K_A> Wait, they were in school until night time?
*SuperBrony64 hugs SlurryMoon
<Phillie> they put the flaws in on purpose so that the audiance is forced to think about it more, think random pinkie pie
<Mark> have they been gone all day? and there parents are'nt cncerned
<ROBCakeran53> I'm prety sure there are a lot of warrents for her arrest in numerious countries AND planets.
<Ponyfan78> that asteroid was a ship full of aliens who had the secret of life
<DovahkinTwilight> Who hates this show? raise thy hoof high!
<pikorar> One of the meteors hits their house.

<Shizuka> 13teleportation
<otakon> wait
<RainbowKitten> THAT MOTHER IS HER FATHER!
<TheWattsMan> she has connections
<emangamer> SuperBrony64: moral of the story: always rely on magic to help solve your problems
<Sus> That's a really good question.
<NewCalamity> I always saw a meteor smoking her in the face in that scene
<Fluttershy_yay> Who needs NASA when you are Canadian....we have.....trees? <.<
