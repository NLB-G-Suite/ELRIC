<Modeabel> Nintendo and Sega
<Panda> GigabitHarmonie, no no no no you said "rule the digital world" its "save the digital world" /)_=
*MASF123 does like COD2 the Big Red 1 however...
<Quick_Thinker> music in games are what would sell me
<Vordox> Spice up the games
<MASF123> Nintendo
<scottish-geeky> game play
<pony_8000> ruling is more fun than saving trufact
<Quick_Thinker> he does have very good and valid points though
<Polydunami> SNK all the way, babe!
<MASF123> Sega is almost done for all they make are games now...no consoles.
<Sumica> 00,10Sound can cary a game more then video can
<Quick_Thinker> all of them are needed to make a game fun

<Barbetos> Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie both you guys said something about Mega Man earlier, so apply Vordox's question to that. What about that game in the context of his question fits it? Megaman for me is so memorable becuase of the music/audio
<Dark_Horst> what do you think about the rising trend of cellshading?
<MASF123> Megaman has kickass music
<Polydunami> Perhaps some of the Mega Man music is TOO memorable? :$
<scottish-geeky> MASF123: hell ya
<MASF123> Cellshading looks beatiful
<Quick_Thinker> style is very important

<Memme> At the gala!
<dalekkahn> I am a SCIENTIST. I want to know what happens. Is that so evil?
<Memme> Yay!
<Memme> dalekkahn: Well... for science. Right? >: D
<derpy_pony> do you know dwarf fortress, dalekkahn ?
<Pwnies> wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeew

<Pwnies> BREAK THE SONIC SOUND BARRIER
<CrimsonPhoenix> >Art of the dress
<Pwnies> POW
<CrimsonPhoenix> aw yeah
<Memme> Phase4: DO A RAINBOOM!
<derpy_pony> nothing beats constructing a gatling dog launcher under heavy abuse of game physics
<dalekkahn> I know it. I tried playing it, but I couldn't get food, so everyone died
<derpy_pony> farming is easy
<Memme> Uhm.
<Memme> Is that supposed to happen?
<derpy_pony> mark a plot, get seeds ready
<Pwnies> Gatling Dog Launcher?
<Pwnies> SOUNDS FHAN
<derpy_pony> everything working as intented
<derpy_pony> nothing to see here
<Memme> It's fine.
<Memme> No immideate death here.
<dalekkahn> Phase4: one of the failed runs you need to release the kerbal when you are in the air, let it fall onto the ground and see if it splats. FOR SCIENCE
<Memme> Was that spelled right?
<derpy_pony> what exploded?
<Phase4> 00,02dalekkahn, they do splat
<Memme> dalekkahn: LOL
<Phase4> 00,02derpy_pony, adv sas module
<derpy_pony> `oh
<derpy_pony> do they splat in water?
<derpy_pony> we need to know
<Memme> Phase4: In this game, do you have some kind of budget?
<Shamroc> ded
<crazypony> lol
<Phase4> 00,02Memme, thats planed for a future version
<derpy_pony> ouch
<dalekkahn> Memme no
<Memme> Dat lag.
<dalekkahn> but eventually
<Pwnies> Boom
<dalekkahn> Is a multiplayer version planned?
<Memme> Phase4: It gets more and more realistic then.
<Phase4> 00,02Memme, kinda
<Phase4> 00,02but they will keep this mode
<derpy_pony> components have a price, Memme. but it has no effect so far
<Memme> dalekkahn: I can imagine it. CRASH BOOM BANG.
<Pwnies> Phase4, I know it's awesome, make a giant rocket dildo
<Memme> Phase4: I see.
<derpy_pony> with a budget, you can set mission goals and build campaigns
<Pwnies> Phase4, DO it and I'll give u moar noodles
<derpy_pony> might be fun
<Memme> ded
<derpy_pony> all good
<Memme> Nothing like having Pinkie singing Giggle at the Ghosties while going on a suicide mission.
<Derpdash> lol
<derpy_pony> this mission is 120% safe
<Hrafn> there's nothing safer than Kerbal space planes
<derpy_pony> not enough
<derpy_pony> it won't reach the orbit
<dalekkahn> Hrafn: Except for any mode of transport that isn't kerbal
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Memme> Ther's nothing more safe than Phase4s suicide planes.
<Hrafn> :P
<Phase4> 00,02isnt realy enough fuel for intercontinental flight
<Phase4> 00,02this plane is absurdly safe
<derpy_pony> one more booster at the core plane fixes it
<derpy_pony> true
<Memme> Phase4: Are you going with trial and error with your designs? xD
<Memme> What?
<Memme> Is he?
<Memme> He is, isn't he?
<Pwnies> :D
<Pwnies> Yes
<Pwnies> YS
<Memme> Wow.
<Memme> Balls of steel.
<dalekkahn> FOR SCIENCE
<Hrafn> oh well, there's more Kerbals where that came from :P
<Pwnies> Phase4 let him dai
<Memme> RIGHT!
<derpy_pony> without the ballast, he might make the intercontinental jump
<Phase4> 00,02well poo
<Pwnies> WILL HE BURN
<Memme> Is the rocket flying away from him?
<Pwnies> Dat face
<Pwnies> "fuck"
<Hrafn> Kerbal face :I

<Pwnies> Does he go splat with the blood
<derpy_pony> he will be a beautiful shooting star
<Memme> Keep calm and suffocate.
<Pwnies> HNO

*Pwnies shits himself
<Pwnies> AHHHHHHHHH
<Pwnies> Why mean munstah yell at fwuffy
<Pwnies> NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Memme> derpy_pony: He has been terminated, to avoid further mishappenings for the space project.
<Hrafn> well, on the bright side, there won't be much unemployment with the amount of astronauts that are hired
<dalekkahn> That went as planned :p
<derpy_pony> k...
<Memme> ...
<Memme> lol
<Memme> Awesome music timing.
<derpy_pony> everyone is safe
<Hrafn> this music fits far too well :P

<Memme> Twilights second theme?
<MegaMoonShine> Nope
<MegaMoonShine> RD's theme
<Memme> Rainbows?
<Memme> Right.
<Memme> I thought it was familiar.
<derpy_pony> the core vehicle always survives
<Memme> Kammerjunk: Hello.
<Memme> Phase4: Moving vehicle in sync with music much?
<MegaMoonShine> The song fits pretty well
<derpy_pony> what if you don't throw the wings of, but install the rocket thrusters there too?
<Phase4> 00,02Memme, nope
<derpy_pony> you can get rid of them later
<derpy_pony> +f
<dalekkahn> derpy_pony: that has too much mass to be a practical space craft
<derpy_pony> graceful like a crane
<Phase4> 00,02like a boss
<MegaMoonShine> Blew up anyway
<Memme> Is there a perfect design in ths game?
<Memme> *this
<derpy_pony> all survived
<Memme> Whaaat?
<Memme> Who's theme now?
<Memme> Oh wait, that's no theme.
<derpy_pony> this hurts my sense of aerodynamics...the friction would rip it apart
<DB_Brony> no theme, this is pinkiepieswear
<Memme> derpy_pony: Welcome to the Internet :)
<dalekkahn> Derpy: it's held together with duct tape, nothing can rip it apart
<Memme> Except air.
<derpy_pony> was this planned?
<DB_Brony> mayhaps...
<Memme> Fireworks! NASA VERSION!
<derpy_pony> all three are happy
<Memme> Dat flame.

<derpy_pony> launch pad?
<derpy_pony> grammar...
<Memme> lol
<Memme> Correct yourself; LIKE A BAWS!
<derpy_pony> this is one of the songs I have on endless loop for the metro
<derpy_pony> at morning, when everyone has this "must go work"-face
<Memme> Gotta love that face.
<Memme> Just turn up the volume, and the pretend to "accidently" unplug your headphones.
<Lasharus> Blight.
<Lasharus> Yes, I'm going to randomly rant.
<Memme> Yellow.
<MegaMoonShine> What does this song happen to be? :S
<derpy_pony> haha
<Lasharus> I'm soaked - teacup just decided to crack neatly down the middle from temperature shock.
<derpy_pony> fluttershy likes to be nice
<Lasharus> Also, ow.
<derpy_pony> pepperbrony made it, iirc
<Memme> Lasharus: Aren't they supposed to be able to hold those temperatures?
<Lasharus> Well, this wasn't technically a teacup.
<Lasharus> Rather a beer stein. I consume in large quantities.
<Memme> Lasharus: Oh, lol.
<RD4Life> so i came here cause i was playing slender
<Phase4> 00,02i cant turn the engines off cause i need the thrust vectoring
<Lasharus> Given the thickness of the glass though, I figured it'd be fine.
<Lasharus> And it lasted for a good year or two. :P
<Memme> RD4Life: Had fun?
<Memme> Lasharus: Wow.
<RD4Life> always
<Memme> Ofcourse.
<Phase4> 00,02and then i randomly lose controll of my craft
<Lasharus> Still, near-boiling water all over me. Definite ow.
<Memme> What would not be funny with being chased through a forest by Slenderman, right?
<derpy_pony> no...this is fluttershy likes being nice
<Memme> Lasharus: Burn wounds?
<Lasharus> Thankfully, no.
<derpy_pony> the other one was in the same download folder
<Memme> Thank Celestia for pants?
<Lasharus> If that'd happened, I wouldn't be rambling in here, I'd be curled up in the foetal position mewling at myself while my neighbour calls a doctor or drags me into the shower and turns it up full blast on cold. :P
<RD4Life> we need to fire the orbital friendship cannon at the slenderman. thats probably why he be creepin so hard
<Lasharus> Either or, really. :P
<Memme> Lasharus: Right.
<Memme> Brb.
<Phase4> 00,02dis will take a while
<Memme> Nvm.
<Memme> Phase4: Speed up?
<Phase4> 00,02cant
<RD4Life> lol what is this?
<Memme> RD4Life: Excactly.
<HerpDerp> ...What is this?
<Memme> IDEA!
<Memme> Phase4: Celestia needs you to put up an Orbital Friendship Cannon in orbit.
<Hrafn> HerpDerp: Kerbal Space Program
<Phase4> 00,02hmmmm
<HerpDerp> Aha
<RD4Life> no idea what this is but the 3 things in the corner look terrified
<Memme> Phase4: It is a glorious mission, requiring skills and patience.
<Memme> Phase4: Are you up for it?
<Phase4> 00,02i just flew past debrie from a previous mission
<Phase4> 00,02Memme, i can try
<Memme> Phase4: So you can actually collide with previous missions?
<Memme> Phase4: Nice.
<Phase4> 00,02you can have multiple simultaions missions
<RD4Life> no chute
<Memme> Phase4: Really?
<RD4Life> go go go
<Phase4> 00,02yep
<Memme> Phase4: 20% cooler, instantly.
<Phase4> 00,02problem with this design
<Phase4> 00,02it works
<Phase4> 00,02perfectly
<Shamroc> night everypony~
<RD4Life> chute....you disappoint me
<Phase4> 00,02night Shamroc
<Hrafn> bye bye Shamroc
<Phase4> 00,02untill mid orbit
<Phase4> 00,02when for no reason it suddenly stops working
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ohai everypony :3
<Memme> Phase4: Bug? Or laws of physics?
<Hrafn> hi Spell-of-Gaming
<Phase4> 00,02i lose thrust vectoring on the lower stage
<MegaMoonShine> Ohai Spell-of-Gaming :)
<Memme> Spell-of-Gaming: Hello!
<Phase4> 00,02which i kinda need
<Spell-of-Gaming> Sometimes I wish I have a debit card. :I
<Lil_B> hi everyone
<MegaMoonShine> hi Lil_B :)
<Hrafn> hi Lil_B :3
<crazypony> hi Lil_B
<RD4Life> lol brb gonna watch rooster teeth for a bit
<Memme> Phase4: Wait, if you're going to put a O.F.C in orbit it needs to be struck onto a rocket.
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...what the heck is wrong with uTorrent.
<Lil_B> hi MegaMoonShine Hrafn and crazypony :)
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02Memme, not sure how to lift it
<Memme> Phase4: Unless you can craft it together in space.
<Spell-of-Gaming> When the stream needs a good bufferin', its download speed is becoming lower.
<Phase4> 00,02what should the cannon look like?
<Phase4> 00,02Memme, not yet
<Phase4> 00,02i REALY want that feature
<Phase4> 00,02because then i could build a space station
<Memme> Phase4: That would be cool.
<Memme> Phase4: I need to find out how the O.F.C looks.
<Memme> Like a giant laser maybe?
<Memme> Hmmm.
<Lil_B> I made a picture, but I'm afraid of Uploading it to DA, because the Thumbnail-Picture may looks like a swastike :/
<Lil_B> swastika*
<Panda> ?
<Lil_B> hi Panda :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm still finding a debit card. :I
<Panda> Lil_B, :D hiya
<Hrafn> Lil_B: could always try shrinking it down and see how it looks before uploading
<Memme> Phase4: It's either that or this one:
<Memme> http://derpy.me/ov0Ip
<Spell-of-Gaming> I've been participating in contests on Reddit, but alas, no luck. :(
<Memme> Phase4: Too bad I need to go and eat.
<Memme> Phase4: Might miss it, but I'll hurry.
<Memme> Bye all.

<dalekkahn> Phase4: I wonder if you could use a bunch of landing gear on two different ships to create a sort of 'locking' mechanism to build a space station
<xMLPxREACTORx> i reached the part were dashie ran away this story is not really sad
<Phase4> 00,02i'm quite proud of that
<Phase4> 00,02dalekkahn, you could.....
<Phase4> 00,02hmmmm
<killerpony7733> dalekkahn: A good idea for later update for KSP?
<MaidSurge> Gooood morning Bronystate!
<killerpony7733> A space station that refuels your spaceship if needed?
<dalekkahn> killerpony7733: I'm talking about this version right now. stock parts and such

<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Well trying to make the kerbal race go extinct is a good goal tbh :O
<MegaMoonShine> No Major_Frank we're preparing the orbital friendship defence system
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: there's always three more :D
<Major_Frank> Ah...
<Jim> http://i.imgur.com/LUkl0.gif

<DB_Brony> Luna's doesn't get that many visits with this game
<Jim> doesn't mean the kerbals won't stop trying
<Major_Frank> I just told my friend i was a brony xD

<Major_Frank> He esploded
<Jim> twice?
<MadSurge> Major_Frank: :D did you blow his mind?
<DB_Brony> do you say scootaloo and equestria in conversation?
<Major_Frank> Can you do that?
<Hrafn> I exploded twice once
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<Major_Frank> My cat's name is Scootaloo and i told about him
<killerpony7733> Oh yes this song!
<MaxTheBrony> Epic song
<Jim> DB_Brony, Like, instead of saying "BRB; going to the toilet" You say "BRB, going to EQUESTRIA"
<MegaMoonShine> This song <3
<MadSurge> Time for Luna :D
<MaxTheBrony> Gigas singing yesterday ^^ wonderful
<DB_Brony> Jim: :D
<RD4Life> so you compare your bathroom with equestria?

<Memme> If this game doesn't have a dark backstory I am dissapoint.
<MaxTheBrony> O.o This looks better than i thought it would
<Shizuschlafen> 13it's like "hm, i'm dreaming.. oh well let's see how this goes"
<TheRandomkid321> xMLPxREACTORx You should try listening to an audiobook. Things are much more emotional for me when I hear them.
<Memme> Shizuschlafen: Well. Bad luck.
<alexxm> so what do you do in this game
<xMLPxREACTORx> the ending made me want to cry
<Memme> So THAT is what you do.
<TheRandomkid321> Minecraft meets portal.
<derpy_pony> what is this game?
<Memme> TheRandomkid321: Excactly.
<Memme> QUBE
<Derpdash> im already confused :P
<Shizuschlafen> 13i think it took me 2.5 hours to clear qube the first time... let's see how fast phase goes
<alexxm> this game seems intresting
<Memme> alexxm: It does, doesn't it?
<alexxm> yep Memme
<xMLPxREACTORx> is there another fanfic one that is not sad
<Derpdash> does it have a storyline at all?
<Memme> If this game doesn't have a dark backstory, I am dissapoint.
<Shizuschlafen> 13think portal but without the dialogue, it's about the same
<TheRandomkid321> Derpdahs what does it look like?
<Shizuschlafen> 13strange environment with physics based tests
<Shizuschlafen> 13gets weird later
<Derpdash> nope
<RaveBrony> Good morning, everypony! :)
<Major_Frank> Dear Esther has a pretty awesome story though..
<Memme> RaveBrony: Good morning!
<Major_Frank> But you cant really call that a game..
<Jim> but the dialogue of portal was amazing
<Shizuschlafen> 13dear esther has a story?
<Lil_B> hi RaveBrony :)
<Memme> Major_Frank: I need to try it out.
<Jim> hai RaveBrony
<alexxm> how you doing RaveBrony
<killerpony7733> Does anypony have tribes ascend?
<Shizuschlafen> 13i thought it was a guy rambling into a microphone then building a pretty world and completely forget he's designing for an interactive medium
<Jim> Shizuschlafen, Yatzhee went as far and called Dear Ester "Not a game at all"
<Memme> ...
*RaveBrony waves to Memme, Lil_B, Jim and alexxm
<Shizuschlafen> 13yahtzee reviewed?
<RaveBrony> Im doing good alexxm, and yourself?
<Shizuschlafen> 13i thought that was totalbiscuit
<alexxm> i'm good RaveBrony
<Jim> He mentioned it in some video I believe
<Memme> Who's yahtzee again?
<Shizuschlafen> 13zero punctuation, yellow background guy
<Jim> oooh
<alexxm> Memme the zero punctuation guy
<Memme> Ahh.
<Memme> I see.
<Jim> right
<Memme> Thanks.
<Jim> I confuzzled those two for a moment
<Jim> it was Totalbiscuit
<Shizuschlafen> 13totalbiscuit is the "wtf is X" vids
<Memme> Yeah.
<TheRandomkid321> I have hated totalbiscuit ever since he insulted bronies... i cant watch him anymore.
<Memme> The cynical brit.
<Shizuschlafen> 13which btw convinced me to get frozen synapse and risk factions :3
<MaxTheBrony> When did he do it!? TheRandomkid321
<Memme> TheRandomkid321: He did?
<alexxm> TheRandomkid321 when did that happen
<MaxTheBrony> o.O
<Shizuschlafen> 13he's a bit egotistical but eh
<shana> reset button :D
<TheRandomkid321> In his WTF if that cure truck full of stuffed animals game. I forget the title. Ill see if I can find it.
<Jim> he's got personality a plenty, that's for sure
<Shizuschlafen> 13snuggle truck
<Jim> but it's enjoyable to watch
<Memme> Did he?
<Memme> Wow.
<Memme> You can't link videos here, right?
<MaxTheBrony> He can Pm :3
<MaxTheBrony> if he got the time
<Memme> Right.
<Major_Frank> Say the title i look it myself
<MaxTheBrony> or that ^^
<TheRandomkid321> WTF is SNuggletruck. And in one of his Teraria videos. In the terraria video he says "You are probably one of the people who accept bronies in their fandom despite their stupidity."
<Shizuschlafen> 13eh
<Memme> TheRandomkid321: ...
<Memme> Well.
<TheRandomkid321> Watch WTF is snuggletruck.
<Shizuschlafen> 13face it bronies are the new furries, just more sane
<MaxTheBrony> When does he talk about bronies?
<Memme> Yep.
<Derpdash> exactly
<MaxTheBrony> At what stampt
<TheRandomkid321> Hey my friend is a furry!
<TheRandomkid321> And bronie
<Memme> So?
<Major_Frank> Hey! My friend is a pony!
<Memme> :O
<xMLPxREACTORx> my lttle dashie is one of the best and sadest stroys i ever read
<Shizuschlafen> 13getting that back of the head "shizuuuu why you awake" feeling...
<Memme> Yep.
<TheRandomkid321> Anyway I wish not to continue this conversation any longer. I can TELL it is going int he wrong direction.
<Pwnies> Aw
<Pwnies> Not this game
<Memme> xMLPxREACTORx: Agreed.
<ninja> hi everypony :)
<Phase4> 00,02very straight foward
<Memme> I'm not even sure what a furry is.
<alexxm> hey ninja how've you been
*Phase4 00,02hugs Shizuschlafen again
<ninja> awesome mate
<TheRandomkid321> Memme many different definitions.
<MaxTheBrony> Heya ninja :)
<Memme> TheRandomkid321: Should I just Google it?
<Pwnies> Also, Hi everyone, I'm back. I was play Gee Tee Ahh : Eypeesowdes Frume Leebity Seetry
<xMLPxREACTORx> hey ninja
<TheRandomkid321> Memme be careful but yes.
<Derpdash> a ball
<Pwnies> SUDDENLY
<Memme> TheRandomkid321: Ok.
<Pwnies> A BALL
<Derpdash> this is no longer logic
<Memme> A BALL! YAY!
<TheRandomkid321> So it ISNT minecraft meets portal... there is a sphere.
<MaxTheBrony> Memme: ^^ i advice you to dont
*Pwnies uses Blocks to play with his ball
*Pwnies *mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm*
*Pwnies is Hitler
<Memme> ...
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<TheRandomkid321> ....
<MaxTheBrony> Dude did you google Furries ^^
<TheRandomkid321> *ellipsis*
<Derpdash> oh i get it!
<Pwnies> Wat
<Pwnies> How did anyone not know about furries
<Chrysalis> what on earth are you guys watching
<Derpdash> the players inside one of those insane asylums!
<Memme> MaxTheBrony: Yes.
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<Derpdash> this is all in his head!
<Chrysalis> ahh its that puzle gmae
<Chrysalis> game*
<Pwnies> MEMME YOU DIDN'Y KNOW WHAT A FURRY WAS
<Memme> What is Chrysalis doing here?
<dalekkahn> The game is called QUBE
*Pwnies shits himself
<Chrysalis> i'm always here
<TheRandomkid321> Pwnies STop this madness
<Memme> Pwnies: I am not entirely shure, no.
<Memme> *sure
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
*Pwnies :O
<DB_Brony> Pwnies: wait what...
<Memme> I always doubt what I think I know...
<MaxTheBrony> I think there is Two deffinitions of furries
<Pwnies> lol
<alexxm> can you die in this game
<Pwnies> Phase4 you silly filly
<Memme> First one is?
<TheRandomkid321> Pwnies this isnt a roleply site... No matter WHAT you're intp.
<MaxTheBrony> Ones wich are for adults and other for ... Well i dont know :)
<Phase4> 00,02now there getting better
<TheRandomkid321> One are people who dress up in fursuits.
<Memme> ...
<MaxTheBrony> yeah
<Memme> And the other one is porn?
<Pwnies> The other masterbate to furry porn :)
<MaxTheBrony> Eyup
<Chrysalis> can i remind everyone discussion of adult material is not allowed
<Pwnies> Including myself
<Memme> Chrysalis: Sorry.
<Phase4> 00,02this is actually very much like portal, each level is trivial and demonstrates cleanly a new concept
<Derpdash> this game mentally hurts me 6_9
<Chrysalis> remember to read the rules
<Phase4> 00,02BUT
<TheRandomkid321> And some who... wel... clop... but instead of to ponies they do it to anamorphic (or whatever) animals... I SAID IT OKAY!
<Pwnies> A BIG BUT
<Phase4> 00,02it doesnt have the humor
<MaxTheBrony> Chrysalis: I tried to keep it from coming ut :P so litteraly
<MaxTheBrony> out*
<Phase4> 00,02and that distracted from the triviality of it in portal
<Memme> Phase4: No dark backstory? D:
<Phase4> 00,02and yes, i will compare every puzle game with portal
<Chrysalis> The humour adds so much to portal
<Phase4> 00,02Memme, well not that i can see
<Derpdash> i loved portal's jokes
<dalekkahn> Phase4: Everyone will for a long time
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, it does
<Major_Frank> Its a clever game though
<Pwnies> Phase4 it was critisized for being so much like Portal. But that hardly anything because the people who Portal made this :P
<Memme> lol
<Phase4> 00,02Pwnies, odd critisizim
<Memme> So there's no story to this?
<Phase4> 00,02you'd think that'd be a plus
<Pwnies> Nope
<Phase4> 00,02Memme, the trailer sugested a minor one
<shana> Pwnies: um citation needed?
<Phase4> 00,02but nothing explicit
<TheRandomkid321> I dont think valve made this
<Memme> Phase4: Hope it comes later then.
<Pwnies> Basically it's portal-like puzzles. But nothing to break it up. It's like IWBTG. but with less rage
<shana> Pwnies: you are not confusing this with quantum conundrum?
<MaxTheBrony> D: this seems like a good puzzle game but from an estethic point of view it looks real dull
<Chrysalis> really?
<Chrysalis> i quite like the look
<Chrysalis> nice and clean
<Texasboykc09> hello everypony
<Chrysalis> with no brown
<Memme> Should I go with the name I have now or Emil?
<MaxTheBrony> True but its abit repedative in its look dont you think?
<Memme> Texasboykc09: Hello.
*DB_Brony Agrees with MaxTheBrony
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Texasboykc09 :)
<Pwnies> It has the potential to be a great game. but they focused mainly on gameplay, not so much as to make people want to play it :P
<alexxm> how you doing Texasbokc09
<alexxm> how you doing Texasboyc09
<shana> some people like puzzle games just for the sake of puzzles
<Memme> Is there ANYTHING POSITIVE About it so far?
<shana> like me ^_^
<Derpdash> lol
<Chrysalis> Pwnies its a great game though, its for a specific set of players
<Pwnies> Key word being some
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah and for those this game sure is awesome
<Pwnies> Not most
<Memme> It has a new concept!
<shana> yeah that's why puzzle games usually don't get mainstream
<Chrysalis> even though this game isnt for me i love the idea of it
<Chrysalis> they knew there market and made the game for it
<Chrysalis> and didnt just play it safe
<Pwnies> So in all. If you like puzzle games, and don't really mind there being no story, this game wouuld be a good investment
<MaxTheBrony> Have this game made money?
<MaxTheBrony> Did this game sale*
<Pwnies> sell
<Pwnies> Yes and no
<Memme> ...
<MaxTheBrony> Oh :p ty
<Pwnies> It definately sold
<MaxTheBrony> sell*
<Memme> sold.
<MaxTheBrony> I meant for mine xD
<Memme> Oh.
<MaxTheBrony> Sorry i will not fix past problems :)
<Memme> Didn't he already correct it, though?
<Chrysalis> puzzle complete
<Derpdash> HUZZAH! Next level!
<MaxTheBrony> yeah i know :p
<Chrysalis> that one looked fun
<Derpdash> sorta...
<Pwnies> This game is definately not for me
<Pwnies> I love portal
<Pwnies> But I don't have the patient to actually complete it
<Derpdash> that one looked easy :/
<Memme> Really?
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<Chrysalis> yeah
<Memme> This shit just got scary.
<Major> Hi all :)
<Memme> Someone's controlling you.
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Major
<Memme> Major: Hello!
<Chrysalis> ohai new puzzle introduction
<Memme> Simple so far.
<Memme> Nope.
<Pwnies> Portal was a great example of a good puzzle game
<Memme> Not anymore.
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<Pwnies> But everyone trys to be like it
<Memme> They just went into 3 dimensional thinking.
<Chrysalis> Pwnies not really, they ended up making way too many concessions to make it easier
<Memme> Or more.
<Pwnies> But end up taking large portions of it from the original gma itslef
<Chrysalis> there were entire puzzle elements removed cause playtesters thought they were too hard
<Chrysalis> which is a shame cause they were the best ones
<shana> Pwnies: like what for example?
<Memme> Chrysalis: Like what?
<Chrysalis> pneumatic differentials were removed, and the crushers had a much lower usage
<MaxTheBrony> :O
<Memme> Pneumatic differentials?
<Chrysalis> if you looked at the early trailers, they showed launching vertically through crushers, this was originally a level, but removed cause the playtesters moaned it was too scary
<xMLPxREACTORx> Bye everypony i going to sleep
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...I'm not sure if I want my Steam profile picture to be Ayu from Kanon. :U
<MaxTheBrony> Chrysalis: xD
<Memme> xMLPxREACTORx: Bye.
<pop_gal> What Now?
<MaxTheBrony> Bye xMLPxREACTORx :)
<Memme> Chrysalis: Too scary? Too awesome, they mean.
<Chrysalis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbu-tzA4GbM
<Chrysalis> oops
<Chrysalis> sorry phase
<Chrysalis> but that link is to the pneumatic demo
<dalekkahn> Chrysalis: Write a letter and force them to make a directors cut of portal
<Memme> Phase4: Try turning it back again!
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<Chrysalis> they wont now though
<MaxTheBrony> Lower the yellow
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<Chrysalis> thats why they released the map maker
<Chrysalis> so they didnt have to do DLC
<DB_Brony> trap the ball in between the yello and red
<MaxTheBrony> Back :P
<Chrysalis> close the yellow
<Memme> Back again.
<MaxTheBrony> Raise the red one
<Derpdash> welcome back MaxTheBrony
<Memme> To the left!
<Phase4> 00,02*derp*
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Derpdash :)
<Memme> ...
<DB_Brony> yeah
<Texasboykc09> whats phase4 playing
<Derpdash> HUZZAH!
<Chrysalis> thats the sign of a good puzzle
<Memme> Phase4: Genius.
<MaxTheBrony> Q.U.B.E
<Chrysalis> easy solution hard to find

<AdamTheDuck> Did phase get Morrowind?
<Phase4> 00,02not sure what race ditz should be
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, yup
<shana> furry race, 8
<AdamTheDuck> Khajiit
<AdamTheDuck> :D
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<OtakuTom> Go kitty people! :P
*shana purrs
<AdamTheDuck> dat morrowingd theme
<red_ony> if you know game: Make Altmer mage with no magica regeneration birthsign .. I like mages..
<Phase4> 00,02dat texture
<Phase4> 00,02they just took a house cat and a camera
<red_ony> you could have installed some mods to make it look better
<shana> everything is 20% cooler with a tail :D
<AdamTheDuck> Best elder scrolls theme imo
<red_ony> especially character models
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Phase4: khajit then she can be a silleh kitteh :3
<OtakuTom> Yea, it does XD
<Phase4> 00,02red_ony, but that would require me to know that
<red_ony> :)
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, :D
<alexxm> the khajetts look better in this one
<AdamTheDuck> dat orchestra
<Phase4> 00,02music
<AdamTheDuck> Eargasms
<Phase4> 00,02: D
<Phase4> 00,02and they can wear those boots right
<Phase4> 00,02the quick ones
<red_ony> Just take whatever you fance..I'D only advice against the beast races
<red_ony> and no closed helmets
<red_ony> oh misread
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> yeah Phase4 just do wat ever race you want
<red_ony> kajit and argonians cant use closed helmets and boots
<Phase4> 00,02red_ony, wait
<Phase4> 00,02boots of blinding speed
<Phase4> 00,02i want those
<Phase4> 00,02kajit cant wear those?
<AdamTheDuck> no phase, you want SKOOMA
<red_ony> I don't think so...
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Phase4: Oo why did you decide to play this TES instead of skyrim?
<red_ony> In fact, the only noticeable weakness is what it shares with Argonians. The restriction of limited headgear and outright lack of shoes takes away a lot of things you can use.
<Phase4> 00,02nothing to sugest i cant wear them on uesp
<Bronysith> ahahahhahaa
<Bronysith> i need to go to uesp
<red_ony> I just quoteed uesp
<Bronysith> unlike in skyrim thieves guild. i actually need to look how to do this up
<Phase4> 00,02fffuuuuuuu
<Phase4> 00,02i cant be kitty
<Phase4> 00,02can i change now or do i have to restart/
<Bronysith> u gotta restart
<red_ony> I think theyll ask you if you are contend with character in the end
<Phase4> 00,02dat quit button
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> aww sorry bout that Phase4 been ages since i've played MW
<alexxm> yeah these games usaully offer a chance to change the character at the end of the tutoraial bit
<red_ony> there is a console command for it as well
<red_ony> to get the character creation screen
<Gunthler> Dat same voice actor in Oblivion
<Gunthler> Dat Redguard voice
<Phase4> 00,02brenton has magic bonuses
<Phase4> 00,02Gunthler, i think he's in skyrim too
<red_ony> breton is nice enough :)
<red_ony> take different head though
<red_ony> :D
<Phase4> 00,02dear god these faces are ugly
<Gunthler> Why am I having a sudden nolastiga
<AdamTheDuck> dat hair
<Gunthler> o_o
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ugh
<red_ony> I think every race has a singly not fugly head choice :D
<OtakuTom> So despite having access to the Guild Wars 2 beta, I haven't logged in at all this weekend >_>
<AdamTheDuck> OtakuTom: lol same
<Gunthler> Dat awkward walking
<Phase4> 00,02mage or theif?
<AdamTheDuck> Why not both? xD
<OtakuTom> Instead, I've been gearing up my priest in WoW...lol
<Phase4> 00,02why not
<red_ony> why not custom?
<red_ony> :D
<red_ony> so many choices... :)
<AdamTheDuck> Is illusion still similar to oblivion's illusion?
<Bronysith> damn it
<Bronysith> my security is too low for this mission
<Bronysith> well. time to loot some shit
<red_ony> mysticism is also kind of nice for traveling spells if I recall corectly
<Gunthler> Dat obsurd name XD
<AdamTheDuck> lol
<red_ony> I'd later change primary thing to magic..it is harder to level
<Phase4> 00,02'Detect Key'?
<Phase4> 00,02what sign?
<XAX> Good evening.
<Phase4> 00,02evening XAX
<AdamTheDuck> damnit my youth TES xD

<Phase4> 00,02what about shadow?
<Phase4> 00,0260s invisibility
<Phase4> 00,02when i screw things up i can leg it

<red_ony> and drop items from there to the ground
<red_ony> aaah

<Gunthler> Just take off your clothes and run around the town. It's fun.
<Gunthler> XD
<alexxm> my steam names alexxm1
<red_ony> well..he got nothing..
<Gunthler> inb4 over-encumbered
<MegaMoonShine> I dunno about you guys, but I think his crime may or may not have been reported
<red_ony> The guard takes everything he stole away
<alexxm> they keep saying that but nothing happens
<red_ony> if he had droped it to the ground from inventory
<red_ony> that wouldn't have happened
<red_ony> ^^
<red_ony> chat froze?
<red_ony> oh ^^
<Twily> steal everything. XD

<MegaMoonShine> hey Twily :)
<Malmortius> Mornin guys
<AdamTheDuck> at lest we don't have to watch phase spend an hour making a face this time xD
<Malmortius> is this MORROWIND I SEE OMG
<MegaMoonShine> Mornin Malmortius :)
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> ha Malmortius
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> *hai
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> stupid insert button..
<alexxm> HoneyBadger gunthler wants you
<Twily> you havce stolen for the last time...
<alexxm> how you doing Malmortius
<oni_link> Hello everypony :)
*Honeybadger growls
<red_ony> BARREL
<AdamTheDuck> hello oni_link
<MegaMoonShine> Hello oni_link :)
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> ohai oni_link
<Malmortius> Equip the pick on your portrait
<Malmortius> pick up your pick from thefloor xD
<oni_link> AdamTheDuck , MegaMoonShine , and twi_sprinkle_GS17 what am I watching here?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> oni_link: the elder scrolls morrowing
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> *morrowind
<Malmortius> The agony of someone watching an old game. The pain.
<AdamTheDuck> THe magical land of morrowind my dear oni_link
<Malmortius> playing*
<oni_link> ah thanks :P
<red_ony> dat impatience
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Phase4: why did you decide to switch from skyrim to morrowind? or will you be playing both?
<AdamTheDuck> Skyrim crashes twi_sprinkle_GS17
<oni_link> I don't think there is anything wrong with older games, if they are still entertaining then they are stilly playable. Ocarina of Time is a prime example of that.
<Phase4> 00,02twi_sprinkle_GS17, i'll be playing all sorts of things randomly
<Malmortius> whos streaming?
<MegaMoonShine> Malmortius: phase
<Twily> well i'm gonna go and do stuff elsewhere, later
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Phase4: sounds fun :D
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Malmortius
<Malmortius> hi babe
<oni_link> bye Twily
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Twily
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> AdamTheDuck: at which part does it crash?
<AdamTheDuck> twi_sprinkle_GS17: I phase said at whiterun
<Malmortius> No quest markers for you phase!
<XAX> guize what's a good SCP to read?
<AdamTheDuck> but that was a while ago, he might have fixed it
<red_ony> fuck quest markers...seriously
<Malmortius> This is what i love about morrowind, you have to use the actual directions.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> AdamTheDuck: aw, that sucks, before even the dragon battle
<red_ony> another thing I like: no quick travel :D
<oni_link> Malmortius: They test you and see if you were paying attention pretty much :D
<Malmortius> quick travel.. stupidest thing ever
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> red_ony: i would hate havign no quick travel
<red_ony> morrowind has 7 types of travel
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> quick travel saves so much time
<Malmortius> Create a full game, make the ability to skip over it.
<red_ony> I think
<Malmortius> flawless logic
<derpy_pony> in the northwest is an insanely powerful and easy to get artifact. the amulet of shadows. 80% chameleon for 60 seconds, iirc
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Malmortius: well i dont want to waste hours on walking, idont have that kind of time
<red_ony> 3 teleportations spells, the insect transport, boat, mage guilds and dunmer fortress teleport
<Malmortius> Overexaggurating to prove your point sprinkle, it never takes hours
<Malmortius> a good company will make the traveling interesting
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Malmortius: not at once of course, but in total.
<red_ony> :D
<Gunthler> ded
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> its not like the game forces you to quick travel
<MegaMoonShine> That's gotta hurt O__0
<AdamTheDuck> Dem punching sound effects
<Malmortius> Well then i say, tough shit, in all honesty.
<oni_link> Malmortius: As long as you offer a faster means of transport then it doesn't matter the distance. And by doing that, you still allow the player to be immersed and get there in a timely fashion.
<spartan133t> leroy jenkens?
<Malmortius> I agree, transport rather than fast travel
<oni_link> lol
<red_ony> twi_sparkle there is no alternative to quick travel though...like the travel methods of mw
<Malmortius> Im ok with some kind of fast transport, just not fucking instant from anywhere
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Malmortius: lol i can say the same about qick travel. just because you dont like it doesnt mean you have to whine about it, nobody is forcing you to use it
<oni_link> Malmortius: It just takes you out of the game. Instant blows. /)
<derpy_pony> mudcrab boxing
<Malmortius> Thats what all casuals say oni
<derpy_pony> no autoheal
<red_ony> in b4 no regenerating anything
<Malmortius> Its why games these days have regenerating health and crap
<Malmortius> no recoil on guns.. regenerating mana even for god sakes
<derpy_pony> with strong enchantments, you can fill your health bar in a few seconds anyway. but not as noob char
<red_ony> in morrowind you can really brake the game if you know what you are doing
<red_ony> I like the freedom
<Malmortius> same
<oni_link> Malmortius: Nah, thats just what I honestly believe. I can do without regen too but I'm very nitpicky about quick travel. Its not as fun to me.
<red_ony> talk to the elf!
<red_ony> aaaw
<killerpony7733> red_ony: Seen the quickest known speedrun of it?
<red_ony> jup
<killerpony7733> Guy gets to the last area in the matter of a minute
<red_ony> alchemy
<red_ony> ?
<Malmortius> Again, you're basing your experience off games that use fast travel as a way to not have to put effort into big portions of the game
<derpy_pony> brew int potions, drink them, brew more int potions with buffed stats, drink these int potions, infinite stats
<Malmortius> If there was no fast travel people would take the time to make content in these areas
<derpy_pony> as example
<red_ony> well..he found a transport
<red_ony> when I first played I didn't
<red_ony> and walked to balmora:D
<derpy_pony> it's not far
<red_ony> still :)
<derpy_pony> and you can even fight a rat or two
<Malmortius> Beware, i has a candle stick
<Phase4> 00,02Wait
<Phase4> 00,02what
<oni_link> Malmortius: yup. and this is why Im against it. If we had devs who actually thought of making traveling part of the experience, then that would be the end of it.
<Phase4> 00,02'if i start to bore you about morrowind lore, just let me know'
<Phase4> 00,02>ask about lore
<Phase4> 00,02'read a book or something'
<red_ony> NEVER
<red_ony> ;)
<derpy_pony> master of the candlestick
<Malmortius> Im sort of even ok with the caravan travel thing in skyrim, its still instant and its almost crossing the line, but at least you have to actually go to it and pay
<Malmortius> instead of just teleporting from freakin anywhere
<oni_link> lmao
<oni_link> thats enough theif! *takes everything*
<red_ony> hes fucked
<red_ony> now he has to swim all the way around :/
<oni_link> Yikes
<MaxTheBrony> This music tho :D
<oni_link> ^ ^ ^
<Malmortius> Good ol balmora
<Malmortius> this is where i spent my childhood
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<oni_link> I was in Hyrule for most of mine, thus the nick :P
<Malmortius> i know this city better than my own
<derpy_pony> I know Balmora better than my neighborhood
<Malmortius> epic swimming music
<derpy_pony> oh...ninja'd
<oni_link> Funny how that works eh? :D
<derpy_pony> beaten to death with a blunt object
<XAX> Aight. 1:07am. I'm tired.
<XAX> Night all.
<oni_link> Candle holder of death!
<derpy_pony> good night XAX
<MegaMoonShine> Night XAX :)
<oni_link> Night XAX
<AdamTheDuck> night XAX

<AdamTheDuck> ded chat?
<killerpony7733> npe
<killerpony7733> nope**
<derpy_pony> ded
<GilDash> killerpony7733: It kinda is! :D
<killerpony7733> GilDash: Shush you!

<derpy_pony> get an axe and an iron armor and go partying
<oni_link> oh shiii
<killerpony7733> derpy_pony: I think the quote ''another mans garbage may be another mans treature''
<derpy_pony> stealing is bad, hmkay?
<killerpony7733> GilDash: You are using a IRC client
<killerpony7733> You can see people joining leaving etc
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Yeah, it's alright. Not really impressed with it.
<derpy_pony> is there a way to activate these messages here in the flash client?
<derpy_pony> weapon traders are on the other side of the river
<killerpony7733> Those abs
<red_ony> yeah..I'd totally sleep in that guys bed while he is watching
<red_ony> :D
<oni_link> lol wut
<AdamTheDuck> did he just whistel?
<red_ony> yap
<shana> I woudn't sleep there..
<AdamTheDuck> lolwut
<AdamTheDuck> dat leveling ocd
<red_ony> he'll get a pretty imbalanced character if he only levels acrobatics and athletics
<red_ony> ^^
<red_ony> no touch
<AdamTheDuck> STEAL THE GEMS
<AdamTheDuck> YOUR OCD CALLS TO IT
<Malmortius> I also like theres no big "YOU ARE ABOUT TO STEAL THIS ITEM" marker
<Malmortius> Like the item turning red ro some crap..
<red_ony> yup
<red_ony> also you can sell stolen goods no nproblem
<derpy_pony> back in my days, we had a thing called common sense
<red_ony> just not to the person you stole it from
<derpy_pony> hahaha
<oni_link> lol
<AdamTheDuck> You mean merchants don't magically know what items have been stolen and which haven't?
<alexxm> suddenly explosion
<AdamTheDuck> What sorcessary is this>
<red_ony> yup :D
<alexxm> what just happened
<oni_link> AdamTheDuck: literally :D
<Phase4> 00,02u have no clue where to go
<Phase4> 00,02i'
<Phase4> 00,02i have no clue wherre to go
<derpy_pony> got caught stealing from the mages guild
<Phase4> 00,02derp
<derpy_pony> explosion
<red_ony> to some quest in the mages or warriors guild
<Malmortius> Read the directions in your inventory
<red_ony> *do
<Phase4> 00,02derpy_pony, ikr
<derpy_pony> get some missions, phase4
<AdamTheDuck> THIEVES GUILD, wait was there even a Thieve's Guild in Morrowind?
<Phase4> 00,02oh, i already found that guy Malmortius
<derpy_pony> the guy who wanted to give you orders has some. the guilds too
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, i think there is
<Malmortius> Oh.
<red_ony> I didn't read what cassius said, but I think it's along the lines of "get stronger and get equipment"
<derpy_pony> there is
<derpy_pony> in the southwall
<AdamTheDuck> THEN THE THIEVES GUILD WILL BE PERFECT FOR YOUR OCD PHASE
<oni_link> lol
<Malmortius> Well, the world is free Phase. Do anything you like, id recommend a guild you're specialised in. Its niot like skyriml, you cant complete every guild with any character
<AdamTheDuck> ALL ZEE LOOT YOU CAN GET YOUR HOOVES ON
<derpy_pony> get an armor...any armor...and something to hit with
<Malmortius> If you dont have lockpicking in the thieves guild, for example, ou're gonna have a bad time
<derpy_pony> the fighters guild has a trader
<red_ony> there are plenty of traders around
<red_ony> just check map
<derpy_pony> each of these vases is worth something like 1 coin
<AdamTheDuck> loot anyway
<MaxTheBrony> Wait is this all in game music we are hearing?
<AdamTheDuck> Yep, good ol' Morrowind theme.
<MaxTheBrony> O.o its so beautiful
<AdamTheDuck> Best TES theme imo
<MaxTheBrony> Indeed
<MaxTheBrony> :O
<derpy_pony> despite being quite simple
<oni_link> its lulling me to leep
<Phase4> 00,02this is how theif works right

<oni_link> *sleep
<AdamTheDuck> lol silly phase
<oni_link> i mean that in a good way

<Lil_B> I tried*
<herostar_Discorded> everypony, i want everyone to take a moment to remember the 2011 osla/utoya attack, as today is it's memorial. 77 lives were lost that day. and to me thats a heavy loss, and it should be respected.
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-move-it-football-head.jpg
<ekips> Phase4, now, you are supposed to have your weapons :3

<EspyLacopa> New episode of Yugioh Abridged.
<herostar_Discorded> well that was a well respected moment of silence -_-x Thank you, streamer for "theme appropriate" music.
<Lil_B> oh man oh god, oh god oh man oh god oh man!
<EspyLacopa> They finally wrap up the virtual reality plot. No more Noah!
<oni_link> Lil_B: :D
<herostar_Discorded> nopony knows the 2011 osla/utoya attack, do they?
<Phase4> 00,02i told him not to ware a red shirt
<Phase4> 00,02he didnt listen
<Lil_B> herostar_Discorded was in sweden or norwegen? (I fI'm thinking about the right thing)
<oni_link> herostar_Discorded: I honestly dont but I am sorry for the family of the victims...
<Phase4> 00,02sniper rifle moves a lot
<derpy_pony> herostar_Discorded: didn't know anyone there personally
<Bronysith> Phase4: part of the fun
<herostar_Discorded> the norwegian capitol was the place, Lil_B
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-werent-we-all-curious-at-that-age.png WHAT THE BLOODY SHIT?!
<ekips> it becomes steadier if you put skill points in Sniper Rifles Phase4^^
<MegaMoonShine> Bronysith: What the shit indeed O____0
<oni_link> Bronysith: what is this I dont even
<Lil_B> herostar_Discorded thanks, than its the one I was thinking about
<herostar_Discorded> it was bombed. massively. it was 77 people killed, kids, men, mothers, dads, some left with no family some losing some family
<herostar_Discorded> it was a massive deal. and today is the memorial.
<derpy_pony> time goes by fast
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-thanks-ants-thants.jpg
<derpy_pony> not long and it will be 10 years agi
<derpy_pony> ago
*Lil_B is afk, vakuuming his room
<ekips> Phase4 if you crouch while sniping it will become steadier iirc
<herostar_Discorded> being a pagan, i don't just ignore a mass death that large. it affects my magicka and my lifeforce, makes my mood darker. i also mourn the event, and pray for those who were killed and the families that were devastated.
<herostar_Discorded> that, is not, something someone ignores. no matter where you're from.
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma go to bed soon
<Bronysith> Phase4: oh no you dont
<Phase4> 00,02will probably redo the intro with a different character
<Phase4> 00,02i want biotics
<Bronysith> Phase4: thats why i rolled adept
<derpy_pony> it is, herostar_Discorded. becoming entangled in it or not is a conscious choice
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-uunghh.jpg
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-why-isnt-there-a-dragon-ball-meme-site.jpg lololololololololololololo
<killerpony7733> the game is generally either soldier/biotic/other
<herostar_Discorded> derpy_pony be that as it is, i choose to remember and to mourn.
<derpy_pony> but you have no right to speak for others
<GilDash> killerpony7733: I'm not on stream, so which ME is he playing?
<killerpony7733> GilDash: ME1
<herostar_Discorded> what game is this?
<derpy_pony> mass effect
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Oh, Okay. I might bring stream up then.
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-human-weapon.jpg
<herostar_Discorded> so this is mass effect... i hear people are making a big deal over the endings, unless i have the wrong game.
<oni_link> lmao
<Kandarihu> herostar_Discorded, only the 3rd one
*herostar_Discorded shrugs
<herostar_Discorded> it looks good. might try it sometime..
<herostar_Discorded> if i put down skyrim.
<derpy_pony> mass effect 3 was delivered with unsatisfying endings. heard this was fixed later
<ShadowD3mon25> ...

<Bronysith> still need to beat 2 on pc then buy 3

<Derpy_Hooves> morning guys :3
<Phase4> 00,02well

<herostar_Discorded> -smacks guy in head- oh he'll be fine. "yeah i guess you're right."
<ThrackerzodR> yes i love asshole shepard
<MegaMoonShine> Spitfire: 1
<oni_link> Bronysith: yeah, thats more accurate. Also, I like how the rating systems dont work since kids whine to their parents to buy em M rated games...
<ThrackerzodR> Bronysith : dat loki
<killerpony7733> Blam
<killerpony7733> and he ded
<Bronysith> oni_link: seriosly i think little kids shouldnt be able to buy games from their parents anyways
<Bronysith> oni_link: thats why i like pc gaming. less whiny brats then xbox
<ShadowD3mon25> That is one gigantic ship.
<ThrackerzodR> this is me1 right

<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> ShadowD3mon when you said Gigantic i thougt about Gigabit :P
<derpy_pony> he's a changeling!
<oni_link> Bronysith: Its too complex for them, too expensive to keep running and its not all over the media like the xbox is. I used to love my 360 but the kids, the fanboys, and the inferior capabilities have turned me over to PC. In two months I get a new tower so I can ditch XBOX completely.
<ShadowD3mon25> lol.
<Bronysith> oni_link: WOOOT. what ur steam id?
<ShadowD3mon25> MasterBoss43: ROFL!

<oni_link> Bronysith: damn it. That would have been fun too. and yeah, that didnt really catch my interest. this skyrim mmo is too much like the rest. Fallout would have been more original :/
<ShadowD3mon25> DERP DERP DERPY!
*derpy_pony feels dusted
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: i am only calling the people who actually think skyrim is the best rpg ever stupid

<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> lulz.jpg
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: its called PR.
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: dungeons and dragons board game
<oni_link> Bronysith: which is what turned me off of most FPS titles
<ShadowD3mon25> ?.jpg
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: lets see, you make your own character with his or her own backstory
<Lil_B> RPG is such a big word... I hate it when people argue if something like Final fantasy is better than Elder Scrolls, even though these games are so fundementally different
<ShadowD3mon25> lol.
<MegaMoonShine> Seriously?
<SuperGotenks1989> Hi.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Lil_B: gamers need chillout..
<MegaMoonShine> Hi SuperGotenks1989 :)
<Ponies47> Hello SuperGotenks1989 :)
<Bronysith> Lil_B: final fantasy 7 is my fav jrpg
<alexxm> hey SuperGotenks1989 how've you been
<Lil_B> hi SuperGotenks1989
<oni_link> Lil_B: they are both good for different reasons although I have to admit I don't like the direction FF has gone lately. X was my favorite.
<ShadowD3mon25> twi_sprinkle_GS17: true.
<Bronysith> Lil_B: actually. chrono trigger ff6 ff7 are tied for my fav game of all time
<SuperGotenks1989> Can anyone tell me how to find Return of Cooler with Original JAP Audio?
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: at least we arent as nerdy as religious people...

<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: true. but i never seen a massive war happen where millions die over xbox and ps3
<Lil_B> oni_link yes, FF has dropped in quality, but I was speaking more theorethycal anyway :)
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: "Your religion is different from mine. WAR TIME"
<oni_link> Lil_B: ah well point taken lol.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: well religion just has more power due to its past. back in the day it was just a reason for war
<oni_link> also, I have to admit that I have never played the big RPGs...
<Lil_B> ThrackerzodR Mother makes me cry every time in any situation T.T
<Bronysith> oni_link: try out the original deus ex
<ShadowD3mon25> War between ps3 and xbox 360 happens on youtube. ikr wtf?
<oni_link> FF7, Chrono Trigger, hell even super mario rpg. :D
<Bronysith> it is one of the most interesting games i have played
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: religion was just a reason, the ultimate goal was wealth and power
<oni_link> Bronysith: Will do.
<Lil_B> oni_link me nether XD, never played any Kind of RPG exept the 3 I just listed XD

<Bronysith> fucking steam port is buggy though...
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: i played the second one, too lazy to play the first one
<oni_link> Bronysith: Ill go with A because B is less likely to happen and C is riddiculous :D
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: the first one is fantastic man. with one of the biggest plot twists in gaming history
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/rage-comics-rage-comics-i-will-never-complain-about-my-job-again.png
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> killerpony7733: ive occasionally playing it over the last 5 years, so much fun with cheats if you spawn stuff
<Lil_B> Can I post a Link to a song I made? (Chiptune)
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: maybe ill try it sometime, idk tho. i wish theyd remake jedi academy with newer steam engine

<oni_link> I only use Famitracker at the moment but Im thinking of trying out ModPlug and maybe try sampling and using FL Studio
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: aw, i really wanted a remake, couldve been so muc fun with the newer physics engine. i really liked how they did force moves in the original, none of that fancyuass force unleashed crap
<oni_link> Bronysith: LMAO :D
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: idk, when i think of Japan, i think of awesome tech
<Lil_B> oni_link I tried a Tracker once, they are rather different than other music programms XD
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: yea. it was a good game and not just a god of war rip off
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Revan, (the main bad guy in KoToR) is my fav sith of all time
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: yeah, force unleashed is riddiculous, the dude destroyed a star destroyer with the force
<SuperGotenks1989> What about Darkstalkers? You know, with Pyron/
<SuperGotenks1989> *?
<oni_link> Lil_B: Yeah, you gotta learn effect triggers and how to sequence :D Ive gotten used to it, they were really intimidating at first :P What you you use?
<Bronysith> Darth Revan is best sith lord
<Lil_B> anyway, just in case someone wants to see it (there is no mod or stream around anyway..) here is the link XD http://soundcloud.com/lilb-7/chinatown-parade
<MegaMoonShine> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Ikr, overpowered much?
<Lil_B> oni_link Linux Multimedia Studio (windows Version)
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> MegaMoonShine: yeah, the whole 'force' concept is getting so blurred its turning into magic
<oni_link> Lil_B: nice
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: i guess what i want is just more high quality games to come out. good graphics or not
<Lil_B> oni_link but I think for Chiptunes good trackers are better, because they usually can everything the console should do
<MegaMoonShine> twi_sprinkle_GS17: 'Tis a shame :(
<Lil_B> oni_link its for free :)
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: it seems most companies are either focused on making the best graphics or trying to make motion controls...
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> MegaMoonShine: indeed..thats why i liked jedi academy, i liked how they represented force moves there, and very fun too
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: everything big is crappy nowadays, whether its music, gaming, or anything
<killerpony7733> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Also the most true and closest you would get to how it would be irl
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: yup
<killerpony7733> with light saver fighting
<killerpony7733> saber*
<oni_link> Lil_B: And that's why I love Famitracker, it's pretty much emulating the NES/Famicom environment and you have to work within that. And I liked your song, the pitch sliding was pretty cool :P
<MegaMoonShine> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Never played that one, heard it's supposed to be good though
<Bronysith> i know how to use a katana in real life. so thats why i want a lightsaber
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> killerpony7733: prolly yeah, it made more sense than the force unleashed stuff
<Lil_B> oni_link thanks... yeah, the "sliding"... ... it isn't really sliding XD I can't really slide in LMMS
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> MegaMoonShine: i recommend it, been like 8 years since i beat it, i still play it occasionally. also a lot of fun with the cheat codes like spawning and other stuff
<Bronysith> BAHAHHAHAHHA :D http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/video-game-memes-video-games-in-case-you-missed-microsofts-press-conference.png
<oni_link> Lil_B: well , you could have fooled me haha
<Lil_B> oni_link its a bund of 1/192 notes XD
<Lil_B> bunch*
<oni_link> Lil_B: lol that work around :D
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/koma-comic-strip-comixed-my-precious.jpg
<Lil_B> oni_link there are 2 major things I hate about LMMS, not beeing able to slide properly and not beeing able to strech samples or transpose samples without streching/shortening them
<MaxTheBrony> Hey again :)
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-books.jpg
<Lil_B> I would like to be able to make songs like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ_YfhfX6mM oni_link
<oni_link> Lil_B: Yeah, that sounds confusing and the same problem on Famitracker. Also ,yesh Virt is amazing!!!!!
<Ponies47> Ohai MaxTheBrony :3
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<Lil_B> oni_link /) for Virt XD
<Lil_B> hi MaxTheBrony :)
<oni_link> Lil_B: (\ whooo! lol

<Cypresswolf> :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jraYcCGel_8
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> can someone check if this link works for them http://www.geocities.jp/z_gundam_tanosii/home/applet/Main.html/ and if it does, is it a mario-like game with a cat thing as main hero?
<oni_link> Ponies47: we must play, and that just means you like good games alot lol
<Ponies47> MaxTheBrony: IT'S TRUE! I have played 27 hours in the past 2 weeks! :'(
<MaxTheBrony> :O
<alexxm> what did you play Ponies47
<Ponies47> Doh ho ho. But I could worse. MUCH WORSE :3
<Ponies47> alexxm: Team Fortress 2
<Lil_B> ponibas ... When I got that I played 14 hours in 2 days :3
<alexxm> ok then
<oni_link> Lil_B: I also want to be good enough to do stuff like this! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gtGeZ2wOmo Im hoping youve heard this one before
<Lil_B> Ponies47: *
<Ponies47> ponibas: Tab fail 1 for today
<String_Shredder> hey guys, any tips on how to get through the first level of Mega Man X?
<Ponies47> Lil_B: 14 HOURS O_O
<Lil_B> Ponies47 I just got it and MLP hadn't been invented yet :(
<oni_link> String_Shredder: the very first level?
<String_Shredder> oni_link: yeah
<Bronysith> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH WHY GOD WHY?! http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-im-pretty-sure-taylor-swift-would-disagree.jpg
<Ponies47> Lil_B: Ah I see. I started playing the game like a month ago
<Bronysith> Ponies47: you just lost...
<oni_link> String_Shredder: if i rememver correctly, you just gotta worry about the crumbling floors
<Ponies47> Bronysith: ?
<MegaMoonShine> Bronysith: -_(\
<alexxm> Bronysith kill it with fire
<oni_link> I don't think Sonic 4 gets enough love
<String_Shredder> oni_link: I'm avoiding those, but everything else is shooting me!
<Ponies47> Bronysith: What?
<Lil_B> I have never heard that before, but It sounds good
<oni_link> String_Shredder: charge the blaster and blow em away
<oni_link> !
<Lil_B> oni_link what I really want to do is work with that Noise-Channel correctly :/ like in this song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNfkWrfcpBQ
<oni_link> Lil_B: Yeah, thats my goal :P
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-michael-snot-cera.jpg
*Ponies47 Whistles out for Bronysith
<Bronysith> Ponies47: whactu wan?
<String_Shredder> oni_link:I didn't know I could do that. thanks
<oni_link> Lil_B: As soon as I saw that it was from the SP game, I knew exactly what you were talking about :D
<Ponies47> [09:29:05] <Bronysith> Ponies47: you just lost... <- What do you mean I just lost?
<Phase4> 00,02and now i Actually go to bed
<Phase4> 00,02gnight
<Lil_B> oni_link but you can't really work with something like this on a programm like LMMS unless there is a really good VST Plugin
<Ponies47> Night Phase4
<Bronysith> Ponies47: you mentioned the game
<oni_link> String_Shredder: Yeah, no problem :)
<Lil_B> sleep well Phase4
<oni_link> Night Phase4
<MegaMoonShine> Night Phase4 :)
<Ponies47> Bronysith: O_O Yeah. I'm addicted
<alexxm> night Phase4
<oni_link> Lil_B: Which ones do you use?
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-dey-took-ur-gravity.gif
<Lil_B> for this song I used a a normal Tripple Oscellator and made simple Squere-Waves (the slideing thing was Saw-Wave), the Drums and stuff I had from a big Sample Archiev I found (I think they are C64 Samples XD)
<Bronysith> god. the princess molestia fanfic is really good...
<Lil_B> oni_link LMMS has a preinstalled Gameboy Plugin and C64 Plugin, I found a very good NES Plugin, but if you want to play around with the Wave you can't do that :/
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/pokmon-pokmemes-mewtwo-is-deep.png um. wow, this quote is just.... WOW
<String_Shredder> Bronysith: sad but true
<oni_link> Lil_B: C64 and Amiga Stuff is the best! I want to get good at C64 chiptunes soo bad, its hella complicated compared to what I'm doing now. And Gameboy tunes are easier IMO, except for the Noise manipulation.
<Bronysith> String_Shredder: how is it sad?
<String_Shredder> Bronysith: We like the molestia fan fic
<Bronysith> String_Shredder: oooh. i thought u were talking about the link i posted
<oni_link> That mewtwo quote is inspiring
<Bronysith> it is very true oni_link
<Bronysith> People who think they should get better perks because of whom they are born to, are scum
<Bronysith> i dont care who your dad is, who your grandad was etc, what color, beliefs you have, I CARE WHAT YOU DO
<oni_link> Bronysith: judge them on their merits and not their background, very well put
<MegaMoonShine> So true...
<oni_link> Lil_B: This is my goal for C64 stuff. This guy is a madman when it comes to arpeggios http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwIRiJWixw
<Bronysith> oni_link: like one time, at school. there was a chair so i walked to it, and a girl ran from across the room and i said "Hey i got here first" "So? IM A GIRL!"
*Ponies47 Sits on oni_link 's head
<Bronysith> that just made me lose more faith in humanity
<Lil_B> oni_link: Razor 1911 ... yeah, this guy is amazing :P
<oni_link> Bronysith: I know, that makes me so pissed off when people make themselves off better than everyone.
<Lil_B> oni_link I'm still experimenting with Apperigios, they still doesn't sound right to me when I make them
*oni_link wonders why Ponies47 is on his head but doesnt mind
<oni_link> :D
<Bronysith> oni_link: thats why i can barely stand code geass. SEeing the way people treat the japanese
<ponibas> gawdammit
<BronyInstrumental> hey everypony, what's the haps? :)
<MegaMoonShine> hey BronyInstrumental :)
<Bronysith> oni_link: this year was my last year of high school, and all the seniors were assholes to others and such. When i was talking to 9th graders and such, (most my friends are younger than me) the teacher said that I should be acting like the other seniors and talking with them
*Ponies47 Gets off of oni_link 's head
*ponibas pokes Ponies47 .... Change your nick :p
<Bronysith> oni_link: "Oh okay, you want me to be a sexist, immature asshole whom makes fun of others and makes threats"
<oni_link> Lil_B: If theres one thing that still troubles me, its arps :D I never know when to use them. And one thing I've always wanted to ask a chiptune artist is, are they neccessary?
<Ponies47> ponibas: But I like being be called Ponies47 ;'(
<Ponies47> :'(
<ponibas> no smiley spam :p
<Ponies47> Ohai BronyInstrumental
<killerpony7733> ponibas: To be fair he does have a bit creative name, Compared to some >_>
<Ponies47> ponibas: Typo
*oni_link misses Ponies47 being on his head
<alexxm> how you doing BronyInstrumental
<BronyInstrumental> i'm good alexxm
<Lil_B> oni_link in my opinion: they do sound awesome, but you can make a song without them :)
<Ponies47> oni_link: It's ok. :3
<oni_link> Bronysith: I never got the point of seniority at school either :/
<ponibas> killerpony7733, i know.. i keep thinking i shuold /nick pony_8675309
<Bronysith> oni_link: i mean, the TEACHER told me to act like how a senior should act. I just went on an ANDREW RYAN speech to her
<oni_link> Bronysith: I don't think that was right of her honestly.
<killerpony7733> ponibas: I mean't both that and those people that use a direct name of something or someone from MLP FIM
<Bronysith> oni_link: explaining how i choose to hang out with people whom are intelligent and actual nice people
<oni_link> Lil_B: well now i know that Im not crazy for having that mentallity :D
<BronyInstrumental> Bronysith: hence you hang here :D
<ponibas> oh i know... the "omg there are X number of variations of RD (or other character)" have benn numerous here
<Bronysith> oni_link: she basically said this "I see your friends are underclassmen, you should not be hanging out with your friends, why dont you go hang out with assholes whom are very immature and make fun of you"
<Lil_B> oni_link and I just found out why I can't make good apprigios XD, LMMS can't make appridgios with less than 25ms between the notes :?
<Lil_B> :P *
<ponibas> and in fact the /nick I said is actually a joke.. but it's an older song
<oni_link> Bronysith: You should be able to hang out with people you can benefit from being with. I think having friends you can grow off of and benefit from being around is what matters, age is a number IMO
<oni_link> also that teacher is really narrow minded
<Lil_B> luckily there ARE ways around that >: D
<oni_link> Lil_B: oh wow. so maybe you can work around that by making a song in a faster BPM/ tempo?
<oni_link> and hi hoof for liking Razor1911 /) LD
<oni_link> :D
<Bronysith> oni_link: yes. also, when she told me to act like a senior i said "What is a senior and how do i act like it? You want me to be sexist perverted asshole? how about pride? Should i think that i am better than everyone else because of my age?"
<Bronysith> oni_link: "Oh and pot. should i smoke pot and come to school high as well"
<Ponies47> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ogvtoEnDxk&feature=related <- YOUR FACE! :P
<Lil_B> oni_link no, when it displays the time in ms its static , I can link it to the beat with 1/8 1/16 and 1/32 for example, but even that when the BPM gets higher it will stop at 25ms :/
<Ponies47> brb
<Lil_B> oni_link but some Plugins have Inbuild appretios :D, /)
<Lil_B> (\ *
<oni_link> Bronysith: Thats todays youth in a nutshell. Not all of them, mind you but the ones who stay in that herd mentality. I don't think someone is better than us simply because of their age. Thats absurd.
<Bronysith> oni_link: exactly! I choose to act differently then the common 18 year old. I am a man
<oni_link> Lil_B: ouch :P maybe you shoud get used to trackers :D
<Chrysalis> no offense
<Chrysalis> but at 18 your not a man
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: *you're
<Chrysalis> 18 is way too impulsive an age
<Lil_B> oni_link for Chiptunes... yes, But I'm making other music too :P
<Bronysith> but i was reflecting on andrew ryan, on how a man chooses and a slave obeys
<Chrysalis> well, unless youv already moved otu
<Chrysalis> out*
<oni_link> Chrysalis: I think that is debateable. I know 18 year olds that are more capable and mature then most people in my age group who act like they are still in high school.
<Bronysith> i am not a man yet, i can accept that
<alexxm> i liked the asterix movie last night
<Bronysith> but calling the idiots in my senior class more manly than me just really pissed me off
<oni_link> Lil_B: For other music, you should look into FL Studio IMO
<MadSurge> alexxm: me too!
<Chrysalis> oh yeah there are some 18 year olds who are incredibly mature, but they are the exception
<MegaMoonShine> alexxm: Me too :$
<oni_link> Chrysalis: glad we can agree on that :)
<alexxm> i regret not reading the asterix books now
<Hrafn> age is not always an accurate measurement of maturity, I've met people my age and older who are incredibly immature, as well as people much younger than me whom I've been able to have intelligent conversations with
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: I'm 26 and I look and act like a silly kid :D
<oni_link> Hrafn: my point exactly
<Chrysalis> unfortunately this generation seems to have a big something for nothing culture
<Lil_B> oni_link I already did, but FL Studio confused me a lot, I may try Ableton or even Qubase later
<Chrysalis> oh yeah, im 22 and havnt really changed much
<Bronysith> Hrafn: thats exactly what i mean! the 9th graders were much more mature than the seniors
<oni_link> I hear that Ableton is good Lil_B
<RaveBrony> O.o
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: I still don't act like an asshole
<alexxm> i regret not reading the asterix books now
<Ponies47> Back
<alexxm> what have you been up to Ponies47
<oni_link> MadSurge: you just like to have fun is what Im getting :P
<oni_link> lol
<Chrysalis> yeah, age has no effect on how someone acts in general, there either a nice person, or an asshole
<Derpdash> Welcome back Ponies47
<MadSurge> oni_link: totally
<MadSurge> Hey Ponies47!
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-exams.jpg
<Chrysalis> people who blame it on "its a phase" generally have no idea what there doing
<oni_link> MadSurge: Im a goof too but when i have to i can be serious and focused
<Ponies47> alexxm: Nothing much
<Lil_B> oni_link oh, another think I don't like about LMMS... it crashes when you even think about using other Plugins... and I use a lot of other Plugins, I must save often
<oni_link> Chrysalis: Most of this generation isnt goal oriented.
<Ponies47> Derpdash: Thank you
<Ponies47> Ohai MadSurge :3
<Chrysalis> nope, we are living in a generation that wants everything but to do something
<Lil_B> dam MadSurges :§
<Derpdash> Ponies47: No problem!
<MadSurge> Lil_B: :D wut
<oni_link> Lil_B: like my old computer teacher used to say : SESO! (save early, save often) :D
<Lil_B> oni_link the old Sierra Adventure game method
<Hrafn> I figure I'm mature enough to be responsible, but I hate seeing myself as an adult :P
<oni_link> Chrysalis: material world mentality
<MadSurge> oni_link: kinda like old adventure games :D
<Chrysalis> oni_link not really
<Chrysalis> you can live in a material world and have a good mindset
<Chrysalis> if your willing to work for it you can achieve anything
<Chrysalis> but you get too damn much nowadays for doing nothing
<Derpdash> yup :/
<MegaMoonShine> Sad but true :(
<oni_link> Chrysalis: yeah, i take that back because even then, you have goals. but nowadays people lack ambition and ask for everthing without giving
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/fanart-cosplay-fandom-base-watch-out-guys-weve-got-a-doctor-over-here.jpg
<Chrysalis> its a mindset of the people
<oni_link> MadSurge: lmao yep :D
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-untitled8.png
<Chrysalis> the whole coorporation thing is also funny to watch, cause its always people wanting the coorporations to give money back
<MegaMoonShine> Chrysalis: *Corporations
<Chrysalis> which when you break it down is "oi, you work hard and get rewarded, i want some of that without doing anythign"
<Lil_B> oni_link do you have a song from you uploaded somewhere?
<Chrysalis> i have abysmal spelling, i know this :P
<MadSurge> Bronysith: not lying, I would be worried if I saw that on the highway :D
<MegaMoonShine> Sorry dude ;4
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-ill-drink-to-that.jpg

<Bronysith> MadSurge: who wouldnt be afraid of daleks?
<Bronysith> they are trashcans of doom
<Hrafn> I wanna be a dalek when I grow up :3

<Lil_B> oni_link and thanks for making Version of my childhood song (the Links Awakening song) T.T
<Hrafn> bath salts make people act very much the same way I do when I haven't had any caffeine
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-dethroned-by-its-own-fan-fiction.jpg
<oni_link> Lil_B: it was my pleasure, that song was burned into my brain back when i was a kid and i had to do it :D
<MadSurge> Bronysith: what's so bad about that book? I keep hearing about it
<Lil_B> oni_link I need to make a remix of something from that game... I have tons of MIDIs to make remixes anyway XD
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/rage-comics-rage-comics-katmari-gagacy.png
<oni_link> Lil_B: Im also working on some more stuff, I just need to record but Ive been putting it off for so long :D

<Braviary> Bronysith, that's a stereotype. During the Dark Ages, the Church was one of the only sources of scientific progress.
<oni_link> Lil_B: Oh, yeah :D I did a remix of a song from the NES Ninja Gaiden and I re did the Zelda II great temple theme from brawl. (But i didnt like the way that one came out)
<Lil_B> oni_link oh XD

<Bronysith> id rather have sunset sarsparilla
<Eulshy> OohShiny: Cool
<Bronysith> sunset sarsparilla is root beer
<Cypresswolf> wouldn't the content of the bottle mold after a certain amount of time? I KNOW the cap covering the bottle wouldnt last long - those rust eventually

<Bronysith> Slenderman: stop startin
<BronyInstrumental> Ryunosuke: i know where that came from......... >.>
<Ryunosuke> no video links
<sagas> silencer?
<Eulshy> Meow
<MadSurge> Slenderman: no video links during stream, please
<Slenderman> but why
<Slenderman> its wierd
<Bronysith> Slenderman: because those are the rules of bronystate mate
<Slenderman> i know
<killerpony7733> Sumica: Oh oh oh it's not where i think it was
<Bronysith> then why would you knowingly break the rules Slenderman ?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Video links are considered distractions.
<ponibas> so you knew the rules.. and did it anyway?
<Slenderman> becuse its a extremely good thing that needs to be spread
<Eulshy> DUH DUH DUUUUN
<alexxm> what a twist
<Vordox> SHORTCUT achieved!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Slenderman: thats not a excuse >.>
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And some streamers find it rude for people to suggest other videos to look at while they're streaming.
<killerpony7733> Sumica: It's near the way where there was that oddly opened gate and there was a vent nearby
<Bronysith> Slenderman: imagine going into a restraunt and advertising another restraunt
<ponibas> lawl
<Eulshy> Slenderman: Ppffff just some game
<ponibas> Bronysith, u wasted your breath
<Bronysith> ponibas: i noticed
<Bronysith> ponibas: acutally i didnt say anything...i typed it up
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And that's why you don't post video links during stream.
<ponibas> ............... did you hold your breath while you typed?? :p
<Chrysalis> well, you shouldnt do it because its against the rules
<Chrysalis> rather than to avoid retribution
<Vordox> Sumica: Do you have the Punch through walls thing?
<Ryunosuke> its rude to post video links during streams
<Chrysalis> Vordox hardly the most stealthy of perks
<Eulshy> Vordox: He doesn't
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> slenderman got kicked?
<ponibas> lol
<Vordox> Damn, cause he could get a pracis here now
<ponibas> yep
<killerpony7733> Dat steam
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: can i be the site torturer?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> aw
<alexxm> soo the slenderman can be beaten
<Bronysith> slenderman are easy to beat...weeping angels not so much
<Eulshy> alexxm but he will be back
<appledash6> youtube.com/pinkpie.mov
<alexxm> they always do
<ponibas> .......
<alexxm> and kicked
<Bronysith> dat kick
<Ryunosuke> that...
<Eulshy> lol
<Bronysith> appledash6: hi slenderman
<Ryunosuke> is circumventing rules... which ITSELF is bannable ;)
<Eulshy> circumvent
<Eddmario> So, Saturn still streaming, or someone else?
<EspyLacopa> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/115/a/3/and____um____cleanse_by_gordonfreeguy-d4xju18.png
<appledash6> youtube.com/pewdiepie
<ponibas> someone else
<Vordox> AppleDash: Is so going to get kicked for a few days
*Bronysith murders appledash6
<Bronysith> wait
*Bronysith makes appledash6 watch star wars phantom menace 1000000 times and then g3
<Eddmario> So, this heat wave...
<Ryunosuke> ya appledash, we are going to have to formally ask you to stop before you get yourself kicked/banned :)
<Barbetos> What is the grenade he is using?
<OohShiny> dat crosshair
<Eulshy> He isn't even putting up good links
<killerpony7733> it's appledash6 theres two with the almost same name
<Vordox> Oh gee, this part.
<Eddmario> Bronysith: The only torture is the G3. Don't know why people bash the prequals that aren't Attack of the Clones...
<Bronysith> Eddmario: well the prequels all suck all together
<OohShiny> Eddmario there's always G3.5
<Ryunosuke> do we need this discussion Eddmario
<Vordox> Oy, Sumica, is there any chance you may get the punch through wall perk?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hey, I'm a Mica!
<Ryunosuke> Midichlorians, that is all
<Bronysith> Eddmario: the prequels are like deciding between drowning in urine or water
<Eulshy> Vordox: I don't fink he's taken any in that line
<Eddmario> Phantom Mennace was on eo fthe better Star Wars movies, in my OPINION.
<Ryunosuke> Jar jar binks :)
<Vordox> Cause it could get a free talent then, bah
<TheBelgianNotBelgian> hello ^-^
<Bronysith> Eddmario: out of all the star wars movies...even the originals?
<Ryunosuke> okay no, I have to disagree
*Bronysith twitches
<alexxm> Ryunsuke kill it with fire
<Eddmario> Bronysith: It was better then Jedi...
<alexxm> hey TheBelgianNotBelgian how've you been
<Bronysith> 1
<TheBelgianNotBelgian> Fine ^^
<Bronysith> 2
<Ryunosuke> the characters had no... personallity
<Bronysith> 3
<Bronysith> Ryunosuke: hold Eddmario down
<Eulshy> Eddmario: Indianna jones is the best start wars movie
<Vordox> Check map Mica
<Bronysith> someone hold Eddmario down
<Eddmario> In my opinion, the order from best to worst is 5, 1, 4, 3, 6, 2
<Sumica> 00,10diffrent part of same area
<ponibas> thats it..
<Vordox> Sumica Yep
*ponibas hoilds down Eddmario
<Eddmario> And I REFUSE to count the second Clone Wars.
*Bronysith twitches
<alexxm> i mean you have liam neisson as a jedi how do you mess that up
<Bronysith> Eddmario: there is no plot or main character in phantom menace
<Vordox> This is the way to the praxis, but you cannot take the mdown in stealth
<Eulshy> Question Mark
<Vordox> 3 of them and they won't move Mica, so ignore this part for now
<Bronysith> alexxm: i dont see why everyone rips on hayden christansen. he did fine with the lines given to him.
<Ryunosuke> there was a plot to phantom menace, but it didnt make ANY sense
<Bronysith> Ryunosuke: even discord thought that movie was stupid
<Ryunosuke> ie. the whole blockade, but no turmoil in the republic? what?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: having a main character is generic
<alexxm> Bronysith i didn't say anything about him i was just wondering how they messed up having liam neission as a jedi
<Bronysith> alexxm: i know
<alexxm> ok then Bronysith
<Eulshy> He'll get us porn, trust him
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: in the game of thrones books, tehre are 8 main characters
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: but he did it right
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: who do i relate to in the PoS that is phantom menace?
<Eulshy> Beep beep
<Alister> Make a save file
<Vordox> SAVE MICA!
<killerpony7733> Sumica: Toggle slow walk and crouch to get close to them
<Eddmario> Bronysith: Phantom Mennace showed how Obi Wan became the tutor for Anakin. Attack of the Clones was pretty much filler while showing the origins of Stormtroopers. Revenge of the Smith showed how Vader fully came to be, the Jedi fell, and the birth of the Empire.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: idk what pos is. and i was fine was sw1 having 3 main characters, and i dont see anything wrong about it
<killerpony7733> Sumica: Shift
<Eulshy> lol revenge of the smith
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: phantom menace had no main character
<Ryunosuke> and tbh, at least ep 1, and 2, the lightsabre fights seemed... more staged as opposed to having more emotion in thier swings in 4-6
<ponibas> do it your way.. guards will never hear a thing!
<Ryunosuke> if that made sense
<TheBelgianNotBelgian> DRB
<TheBelgianNotBelgian> what could that mean?
<Alister> USE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aren't stormtroopers born in thunderstorms?
<ponibas> geee.. a full inventory
<ponibas> what a shock
<Bronysith> Eddmario: um... in a new hope obi wan "HE was a good friend" phantom menace "I gave my word to qui gon to train anakin." Like as though obi wan never wanted to train anakin in the first place, just because qui gon told him to.
<Eddmario> Then you have Clone Wars. the 5-minute shorts Cartoon Network aired leading up to the release of Sith were the Escape from Midnight Castle of the Star Wars series. The crappy animated movie and series that followed is the G3.5 of Star Wars.
<Alister> Should have taken the inventory upgrade
<Malavolent> Star wars discussion?
<Bronysith> FUN FACT THERE ARE ONLY 3 STAR WARS MOVIES, A NEW HOPE, EMPIRE and JEDI
<Bronysith> everything else is a terrible fanfic
<ekips> Sumica: They will never explode when you crouch and sneak at the same time
<killerpony7733> Bronysith: now now alot of the games were just as good
<Alister> Why do you need so many weapons Sumica ?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: it doesnt Have to have a main character
<killerpony7733> Alister: Cause you need different weapons for different things in this game
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: but it has no likeable characters
<ponibas> you were saying??
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GG Mica!
<ponibas> :P:
<ponibas> LOL
<OohShiny> dxed
<Eddmario> Bronysith: Isn't Jedi to Star Wars as Derpy Hooves in The Last Roundup to soccer moms?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Damn Barrels :|
<Bronysith> Eddmario: what?
<Derpy_Hooves> hai :3/
<NullRadix> Bronysith: I've heard there's a solution to the problem of integrating the 3 old movies with the 3 new. The answer is "4, 5, 2, 3, 6"
<Alister> killerpony7733: I only kept the Tranquilizer Gun and the Stun gun and I was ok
<alexxm> hey Derpy_Hooves how've you been
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: lol for you maybe
<Bronysith> NullRadix: the answer is. 4, 5 ,6
<killerpony7733> Alister: Well having a good selection of weapons is good either way
<Malavolent> Bronysith: You dislike the new movies?
<ponibas> get the shotgun back!
<Bronysith> Malavolent: there are no new star wars movies. only 4, 5 ,6
<ponibas> get more ammo later
<Ryunosuke> also, han didnt shoot first, he was the only one who shot :)
<Eddmario> Bronysith: Take those Nostalgia Goggles off. I have actually seen all 3 of the origina trilogy YEARS before Phantom Mennace was announced, and my comment still stands.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> SW3 was great.
<Malavolent> Bronysith: That makes sense. Wait, it doesn't.
<Vordox> Ded kitty
<Bronysith> Eddmario: i watched the prequels first man
<Bronysith> Eddmario: didnt even know it was star wars
<alexxm> Bronysith i always found it odd they just made 3 movies but said it was the 4th 5th and 6th movies
<Bronysith> Eddmario: then i watched the original trilogy
<Bronysith> Eddmario: and thought the original trilogy was 10000000 times better
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> alexxm: its unpredented which makes it awesome
<Eulshy> Obviously a cat
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> alexxm: also its a way of testing if the series coul afford prequels i think
<alexxm> yeah
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> *unprecetented
<Eddmario> Bronysith: Of the prequals, which one is the worst?
<Bronysith> The lightsaber fights have real conflict in the prequels. When luke fought vader for the first time you know what he feels, HEre he is, facing the man who he thought murdered his father and his teacher
<Bronysith> Eddmario: they are all terrible
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumica's arms are 9ft long.
<red_ony> If you want to know what is wrong wioth the star wars prequels look up red letter media analysis of the movies
<Bronysith> Eddmario: id rather see blood in my urine than the star wars prequels
<Malavolent> I've seen the all the prequels in one day, I'm gonna watch the original trilogy now. Let's see, what is better.
<Vordox> GOT REFLEX GET BOTH
<red_ony> his analysis is great
<Vordox> Awww
<Eddmario> Here's an idea, have George Lucas make 3 sequals to Jedi.
*Bronysith murders Eddmario
<Eulshy> Heres an idea, let's all watch the Hobbit
<TheBelgianNotBelgian> Lego Starwars i
<Eddmario> Oh Bronysith, you have no idea what I'v got up my sleeve.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Here's an idea:
<TheBelgianNotBelgian> is better than some of the prequels.
*Bronysith vats Eddmario with the Anti material rifle
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Here's another idea:
<Eddmario> Bronysith: You missed
<Malavolent> Nittany_Discord: Whoa, don't overdo it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sorry.
<Bronysith> Eddmario: i was aiming for the explosive tank right next to you
<Eddmario> See Bronysith? Even Nittany_Discord/Maid_Discord/Nittany_Maid agrees with me
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Nittany_Discord: u so silly <3
<BronyInstrumental> i have never seen the star wars moviez.
<Vordox> LAWL
<Bronysith> Eddmario: he never said that
<Vordox> He's gonna die!
<RAWRity> bonjour
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't agree with anyone.
<Eddmario> Bronysith: He never said he didn't either
<Bronysith> hi RAWRity

<Ryunosuke> hey RAWRity
<Bronysith> that fence is raping the body
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi RAWRity. Let me take your coat and grab you a seat.
<Eddmario> RAWRity: Are the Star Wars prequals just as good as the original trilogy?
<Vordox> If he falls he dies!
<alexxm> i think he was already dead
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01People die when the fall far.
<Malavolent> People die when they're killed.
<BronyInstrumental> i'm making anudder of dem artz ^_^
<Ryunosuke> suddenly BaconMane
<Bronysith> hi BaconMane
<RAWRity> Eddmario: is the mediteranean sea home to polar bears?
<Eulshy> Vordox, doesn't matter he won't let me count gravity kills
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> guns dont kill people, loss of blood does
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> and holes
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: guns dont kill people. BULLETS DO
<Malavolent> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Ban blood.
<Eddmario> Nittany_Discord: Not true. I've seen someone get pushed off the roof of a skyscraper, and break his back on a bench from the fall. He survived.
<ponibas> 1 2 3 4 5!
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: thats overused.
<Eddmario> 11111!
<Eddmario> This door's a bitch
<Bronysith> Eddmario: the password is open
<Bronysith> now anywho
<OohShiny> dat hack
<alexxm> how hard is hacking in this game
<OohShiny> yay!
<Bronysith> RAWRity: um what did you say about the prequels? about polar bears in the mediterenean? that was funny
<dinky> lol
<ponibas> Sumi, killl all the buckets!
<Bronysith> There is no emotional conflict in the prequel lightsaber battles. Oh who is this shmuck? who cares TTIME TO DANCE
<killerpony7733> Wow never heard that one before by doing this before you are actually given the mission
<Malavolent> Bronysith: What prequels?
<dinky> lol beer add
<Bronysith> Malavolent: THANK YOU
<Eddmario> RAWRity: Technically, there is a species of animal that lives in the Mediteranean that's very closely related to polar bears
<Malavolent> Bronysith: Just kidding, I like dem prequels.
<Bronysith> Eddmario: but not polar bears
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: there were plenty of conflicts during the last two battles of SW3, but they cant be emotional all the time during battle. its caleld focus
*Bronysith crucifies Malavolent
<Malavolent> See ya in 3 days guys.
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: it was just DANCING
<Eddmario> The proper order from best to worst is 5, 1, 4, 3, 6, 2
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> bye Malavolent
<red_ony> wtf eddmario? oO
<Nittany_Discord> 11,011 had a horrible ending.

<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: nope.
<ponibas> and here we go again...
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: "You betrayed us anakin. I MUST STOP YOU" time to dance
<Malavolent> Nittany_Discord: Why?
<alexxm> bye Malavolent where ate you going
*Bronysith murder Eddmario to death
<BronyInstrumental> i've never seen any of them, so i can't pass judgement
<Malavolent> alexxm: Oh, just getting killed and ressurected again, that kind of stuff.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01All of this arguing.
<alexxm> ok then Malavolent have fun
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: ok? sw4''youve betrayed us before darth, lets dance''
<dinky> what game is this?
<Malavolent> I sure will.
<RAWRity> http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/demotivational-posters-human-nature.jpg
<OohShiny> bye Malavolent
<red_ony> It's called a discussion :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol RAWRity XD
<ponibas> RAWRity, aye
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: they didnt dance in episode 4, obi wan was weak and frail and you can see that how THATS how an actual lightsaber battle would occur
<OohShiny> it's Human nature to defy the orders
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: theres no highly choreographed bullshit in fighting
<alexxm> RAWRity and we're damn proud of it
<OohShiny> that's how evolution works
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: both him and darth werent nearly as strong as two young strong jedi
<red_ony> very much related..if you got the time watch, otherwise watch later..very in depth analysis of the sw movies...
<red_ony> http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/star-wars/
<OohShiny> a guy find something new by doing something bad
<Vordox> What you need?
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: but there IS NO DANCING IN FIGHTING
<Bronysith> red_ony: love those vids
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: they couldnt move around as much. in sw6 Luke did some pirhouetting
<red_ony> :)
<Eulshy> Ugh my computers bein slow
<Vordox> You need to go back? =P
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: there wasnt any stupid dance highly choreographed bullshit though
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: its called ''fiction''. there are also no blasters or magic irl
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: if people Could move like in sw3, maybe they would
<Eulshy> Yay the stream is.. nevermind, stupid computer
<Vordox> Hmm, trying o remember
<RAWRity> http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/demotivational-posters-yeah-she-threw-me-a-bone.jpg
<Malavolent> RAWRity: Dude, that's creepy.
<ponibas> yay!
<Bronysith> there are 2 kinds of people in this world. People who like high quality shows, intense plot, and lovable characters. Then there are people that like the star wars prequels
<red_ony> :)
<Vordox> What's your currectn objective, Mica?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: no. you just always deal in extremes, its either black or white
<Malavolent> Opinions explained by Bronysith.
<RAWRity> http://chzheroes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/superheroes-batman-superman-avengirls.jpg
<Vordox> Oh those are sidequests
<Vordox> I meant the Main mission cause that is what you just did
<Hrafn> I found the third Star Wars prequel decent, but nowhere near as good as the old trilogy
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: truth is that sw prequels werent as good as the original, but it was still enjoyable, and sw3 was great. it doesnt outright suck
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: and whats with all the hate on christansen? it wasnt his fault the writing sucked. he did well with the lines given to him
<Vordox> Dick Jensen,
<SirGanjalf> It's THE FUTURE. No one gives a shit about lasers anymore.
<Hrafn> the best thing about the third SW prequel movie is that Jar Jar Binks didn't have a single line :P
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: his acting didnt always make sense, Hamill wasnt perfect in sw6 either
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Hrafn: he did actually
<Hrafn> he did? I must have missed it
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6443018240
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Hrafn: he was the one who requested the senate give palpatine extra powers
<Vordox> inb4 takedown
<RAWRity> http://chzheroes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/superheroes-batman-superman-way-cooler-than-the-first-one.jpg
<OohShiny> dat blind guy
<Hrafn> twi_sprinkle_GS17: wasn't that in the second movie?
<SirGanjalf> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Yep, so we can agree that Jar-Jar is the worst thing that happened to the SW universe, preiod.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Hrafn: no it was third i think
<alexxm> RAWRity i don't remember that happening in shrek 2
<Vordox> I thought you would get picked up by Malik after this mission
<Wrek> 05I jsut beat space zombies and pirates
<NullRadix> Its been noted that you can remove Episode I and almost nothing is lost
<Wrek> 05again
<red_ony> I'll be honest Ewooks were pretty bad too...
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> SirGanjalf: i cant actually
<Wrek> 05now what...
<Vordox> And transported to the real next mission
<red_ony> or howevr you write them
<JESmith71> Bornysith, what about the Clone Wars cartoon? Not the CGI cartoon, but the 2D one made by Genndy Tartakovsky (The one with the cool verison of General Grevious)
<Vordox> I'm confused
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> SirGanjalf: hes purpose was to be annoying, and he was, he fulfilled his purpose. yeah he wasnt a very good char, but ive seen worse
<RAWRity> no, Hayden Christiansan is the worst thing to happen to Star Wars, period.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> lol Hayden looked so awkward in the new sw6 version
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> newish*
<RAWRity> he looked awkward in everything
<Vordox> Oh, Mica
<RAWRity> because he's a terrible actor.
<Vordox> You're supposed to head towards the Police station I think
<Vordox> If it's the neural hub thing
<alexxm> hayden christen didn't look as if he wanted to be there
<sub06905|Forza_3> dem sneaking skills
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> i actually think Hayden really enjoyed being there
<Bronysith> RAWRity: what about gunganas?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> i remember reading how he was asking Lucas to play darth vader in the suit despite it being to big for him
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> so he had to wear stilts to fit in the suit
<alexxm> hey Meanwhile how've you been
<Bronysith> RAWRity: or *gulps* midochlorians? *pukes
<sub06905|Forza_3> ello Meanwhile
<RAWRity> Bronysith: still nowhere near as bas as "From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!"
<RAWRity> oh, and "Only the sith deal in absolutes."
<Meanwhile> alexxm: Amusing myself with Bioshock. Funny stuff in that game. How about you?
<Bronysith> RAWRity: says the guy who just killed children
<Bronysith> RAWRity: i loled at the terrible writing of that part man
<alexxm> i'm good Meanwhile what funny stuff did you find
<RAWRity> Bronysith: "He's killing younglings!"
<ponibas> can you heard me n*ack*
<RAWRity> Bronysith: "I love the water."
<Meanwhile> alexxm: Well, freezing someone solid and then shattering them to bits with a wrench is always funny, am I right?
<OohShiny> I'm not as strategic as you wrek, If I were playing this game I would die in the very first minutes, because If there is guns, I act like Rambo
<alexxm> yep Meanwhile
<Bronysith> RAWRity: i dont like sand
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: his head was kinda screwed bythe emperor by that point, he was just ignoring his mind
<Derpdash> Hey everypony! Im back from my muffin run!
<Bronysith> twi_sprinkle_GS17: horrible writing
<JESmith71> That's one of the things that disappointed me in Episode III. Tartakovsky made Grevious a silent badass who was pretty threatning but then in Episode III we get Lucas' pathetic version of him
<OohShiny> sup Derpdash
<OohShiny> ouch
<alexxm> how'd that go Derpdash
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: nope.
<Meanwhile> Punch.
<OohShiny> poor old black guy
<RAWRity> "It's over Anakin! I have the high ground!"
<Derpdash> hey OohShiny
<Bronysith> RAWRity: hey remember when maul had the high ground?
<Meanwhile> You underestimate my prententiousness RAWRity.
<Derpdash> I got 4 blueberry muffins while i was gone :P
<Hrafn> the high ground grants a +5 attack bonus!
<OohShiny> too much star wars in this chat
<Vordox> If I was beside you I could be your walkthrough
<Vordox> :D
<Bronysith> Hrafn: then why did maul get killed? he had the high ground
<OohShiny> boom head shot
<Hrafn> well, uh... plothole, I guess :P
<JESmith71> OohShiny should we save this for tomorrow night when we're actually watching Star Wars?
<OohShiny> yup
<Meanwhile> Even if we're not watching the Star Wars you're talking about. :P
<OohShiny> I won't anyway :/
<OohShiny> I need to sleep early because I study all day long
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Unconcious butt fun?
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: sounds fun
<SirGanjalf> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Maybe, but i don't think that "annoying to the rest of a characters" must equal "annoying to the audience".
<OohShiny> sounds fun butt fun
<JESmith71> Well even though it's just the OT you can bet there's probably going to be your usual "OT vs. prequels" thing going on
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Dead, but fun.
<Vordox> Lawl
<shana> death by snu snu?
<RAWRity> Dat cosplay: http://chzheroes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/superheroes-batman-superman-from-sdcc-amazing-ironman.jpg

<Bronysith> RAWRity: nice
<alexxm> that looks wrong
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> SirGanjalf: i didnt find him that annoying
<OohShiny> ooh
<alexxm> i think my chat derped reopening it
<Meanwhile> Suddenly random guy.

<alexxm> hey Everlasting_Joe how've you been
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ewwww.
<SirGanjalf> twi_sprinkle_GS17: And that's OK. But for me, he was like a failed attempt of adding something kid-friendly(like Ewoks), to the franchise
<Saturn> 08,01:(
<Meanwhile> Pffy.
<OohShiny> oh my
<OohShiny> dem buffers
<red_ony> so next week is star wars? are you going to watch the christman special too? :D

<SirGanjalf> red_ony: Aw HELL NO!
<Hrafn> oh god, the holiday special

<Kandarihu> I just watwched IronBaby. I've seen it before, and I still love it.
<Bronysith> SirGanjalf: now ewoks werent sooo bad as everyone says. kind of funny seeing a teddy bear murdering storm trooopers

<SirGanjalf> Bronysith: It's a personal preference again. But i could agree that there weren't near as bad as Jar-Jar:)
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: Actually, yes.
<Bronysith> SirGanjalf: /me shudders
<Hrafn> nothing is as bad as Jar Jar :P
<Bronysith> SirGanjalf: that is just dog doodie
<Bronysith> Hrafn: id rather see blood in my urine then see jar jar
<Kandarihu> You why it's annoying to fight against Oddjob in Goldeneye multiplayer? Probably the same reason that made the Ewoks so hard to gun down.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: how about this? http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-seor-gif-gtfo.gif
<OohShiny> dem buffers

<SirGanjalf> BronyInstrumental: This fits Conspiracy Keanu even more
<Kandarihu> If you're killing a bunch of people in the whole wrong building, well... ouch
<Meanwhile> Everlasting_Joy: Are you telling me you could miss the Statue of Liberty if it was dark out?

<Bronysith> RAWRity: lol
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: To be fiar, I haven't been to NYC, let alone NYC during a black out. What I was implaying was, if the Statue was a weeping angel, and a complete black out occured in NYC, it should be able to move then.
<Everlasting_Joy> *fair.

<Vordox> I didn't hear, you ust've lagged then. ><
<OohShiny> dem buffers
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: It wasn't driven into the ground. It was driven into the ground, dug a grave, drilled into said grave, buried, stomped on, and then just to finish it off, a monument was put over it which sunk it even further into the ground.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: 3 days and 4 hours left on that bid.
<Kandarihu> Ah, okay.
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: ikr

<Vordox> After bringing the neural hub to your apartment, Malik is told to pick you up and bring you to Highland Park, but will not meet you at your apartment's helipad, instead asking you to go to the helipad next to the transmitter.

<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: What angers me about it is how over used it is.
<Vordox> Wrek: Is it this part? Incriminating evidence that the Derelict Row Ballers are being supplied illegal weaponry. Jensen must infiltrate DRB territory and find the incriminating weapons shipment.
<BronyInstrumental> Meanwhile: playing what?

<BronyInstrumental> Meanwhile i meant like an instrument/a game/what?
<Bronysith> Wrek: vvwat was that sandvich?
<Vordox> Wrek: Then it's likely this part, I'm not certain. If one goes to the Police Station, Alexander's office is on the third floor, code 3727. On her wall, there is intel on Derelict Row: photographs pinpointing certain key enemies, loot stashes, and entry points.
<Everlasting_Joy> Ah yes, using the music to indicate danger, a staple of video games.
<Meanwhile> BronyInstrumental: Well, what're we watching Sumic do? Because it isn't "making his lunch."
<Vordox> I honestly do not know if this is it
<EggoMaidusWhite> Stop right there criminal scum, you have violated the law! Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence!
<Vordox> This quest I must've missed. ><

<Shizuka> 13ded
<RAWRity> f
<Modeabel> p
<Kandarihu> shana, it's a function of any IRC client to parse that text the way it does. It's how channel names are represented, and it's how people in one channel can point people to another channel.
<RAWRity> so, got the first 4 eps of Serial Experiments Lain on DVD from my local used book store. Was gonna get the next three, but they'd mislayed the disc somewhere.
<red_ony> wow
<red_ony> I've wanted to get the series forever
<banarsss> I'm taking an old fashioned antidote. It's suppose to help me concentrate better so I can cram for my Physics test.
<banarsss> It's called a shot of vodka and some red bull.
<red_ony> serial experiments lain dvds are out of print, waren't they?
<Bronysith> um. anypony want to play dead island on pc later? im downloading it now
*sub06905 only has dead island on xbox
<shana> Kandarihu: not all irc clients parse messages for channel names, you can join channels using /join <name> - channel names are short enough to type, not necessarly to clobber the ui with links
<Eulshy> I fell asleep about an hour ago, just woke up with my headphones still on
<Kandarihu> What clients don't do that?
<shana> s/necessarly/necessary
<banarsss> #Shana
<RAWRity> red_ony: more or less, yes. They were a Geneon release, so...
*Bronysith eats banarsss
