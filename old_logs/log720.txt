<eddmario> pony_8142: I think I know how you feal. Sometimes I hate the Kingdom Hearts fandom, and I'm part of it!
<pony_8142> Well let me just join the fandom for awhile.
<FlareChaser> Even in your underwear.
<Shammy> FlareChaser fair enough
<Klumzeedragon> FlareChaser: O U sweet talker U!

<DaringDerpy> pony_5506: there are rumours about the season 4 production. nothing confirmed so far

<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 7 days, 8 hours, 56 minutes, 58 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
<pony_8142> Slowly engulfing me.
<cachi01> eddmario: im part of the fandom but... i really dont take much part of it
<pony_8142> Lets party.
<thelonepony> can i has cookies Wubstep? :3
<cuddly_kittehs> Thats better Pony
<[Alpha]> This is the first fandom that I've been active in
<cachi01> ^
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
*NocturnalBlade bobs head to the song
<AttackWithHugs> ^^^
<cuddly_kittehs> Lets just have a little dance
<cachi01> this and the otaku fandom
<pony_8142> Same.
<thelonepony> ^^^^
<pony_814464> Only 13 eps for S3? :/ Anyone know why?
<Wubstep> You can has cookie
<VenHur> ^^^^^
<cuddly_kittehs> I am.... a bit MEH with the homestuck fandom
<cachi01> bronies and otakus are the most active folks
<thelonepony> Yay!!!!:3
<AJIsAwesome> pony_814464: They haven't said.
<Sumica> 00,10short seasion is due to contract oblegation
<[Alpha]> what's withe arrows up?
<DaringDerpy> pony_814464: syndication
<Wubstep> :'3
<pony_8142> I love this fandom I just dont like mic and It ruined my view of the whole fandom.
<Sumica> 00,10they only have to make 65 eps
<cuddly_kittehs> maybe its because I don't really get into the constant pairings....
<pony_8142> And I know thats wrong.
<Sumica> 00,10that dont meen they wont make more to contune making a proffit from it
<cuddly_kittehs> What did Mic do?
<[Alpha]> Mic the microphone?
<AttackWithHugs> Last thing I kept tabs on in the fandom is Progress
<cuddly_kittehs> I mean, whats the problem with him for you?
<cachi01> only 65 pony episodes...
<cachi01> damn
<L_Y_R_A> 3a?
<L_Y_R_A> ...
<eddmario> pony_814464: They said there's a big reason for it. Maybe the episodes are gonna be longer, or there's a movie in the works that they plan on revealing at the end of the season
<pony_5506> what happens when they make the 65?
<richfiles> There was some manner of press release that explained that with the toy line doing so well, it was not necessary to spend as much for the TV show to maintain the current rate of sales.
<NocturnalBlade> oh i love this guy ^_^
<thelonepony> Yay Nostalgia!!!!! :D
<pony_8142> I dont like tenticuddles either.
<Wubstep> O_o Wut
<cachi01> THIS GUY!
<L_Y_R_A> 3a
<VenHur> Yes, this video!
<SnipsandSnails> They said that the reason for only 13 episodes is because kids don't mind reruns
<AttackWithHugs> And I follow some Tumblrs. Discorderly Conduct and Love Letters are silly
<otakon> well this one will have to be the last video I'll watch with y'all
<eddmario> Guys, this DOES have MLP, but it's the wrong gen for the song
<Sumica> 00,1065 eps is the min required for sindication
<AJIsAwesome> Why would you let one person ruin your view on this fandom? Instead, you shouldn't let him affect you whatsoever if you didn't want to be.
<cuddly_kittehs> pony_8142: dude. Why has Mic and Tenti ruined it for you? What about the cloppers. much more belivable (no offense cloppers)
<DeathStar> 7days 7hours 55m and 40s

<Lunar_Brony> oh shit, we got nostalgia over here!
<thelonepony> thegt90: :D
<FlareChaser> .-.
<Kencolt> Oswald was Disney's first main creation- before he started his own studio. It ws fairly popular, but when Disney left to start his own studio, the rights to OSwals stayed behind.
<Night> XD
<Lunar_Brony> that's a crazy train
<FlareChaser> Alright charles dickens.
<Wubstep> That Cow Wears Glasses.
<Lunar_Brony> hey, it does!
<Lunar_Brony> cartoons sure were different back then
<Cypresswolf> But Disney owns the rights to Oswald now, right? Is that why they put him in Epic Mickey?
<Lunar_Brony> I would assume so
<Kencolt> Disney owns the rights to the characters-- but none of the actual cartoons.
<Wubstep> Wat.
<sub06905> wut
<Night> huh
<Lunar_Brony> and then he died
<Lunar_Brony> THE END

<Kandarihu|Zoro> Sumica, thanks for the stream.
<ILovepinkiePie> PINKIE PIE is best pony
<naturesfury> good evening everyone :)
<sub06905> pffftt its all aboot Twilight
<ILovepinkiePie> hello fury
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6619064576
<naturesfury> how was yall;s movie night
<ILovepinkiePie> sadly missed it
<scout19_tf2> it was ok i bet
<AdamTheDuck> ILovepinkiePie, OBJECTION, Spike is best pony.
<Kandarihu|Zoro> ILovepinkiePie, a lot of bronies would love to see the Sea Ponies in G4, but frankly I think it's less than feasible due to the licensing of G1
<FlareChaser> Fat kids fat kids, whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
<naturesfury> and also LUNA is best pony
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm starting to think that why Twilight is winning in best pony polls is because she's the main character.
<SirGanjalf> ILovepinkiePie: I hope they will. So the seaponies will have an awesome episode and won't be associated only with SHOO BEE DOO anymore.
<Kandarihu|Zoro> I'm also against G4 Sea Ponies, to tell the truth
<scout19_tf2> FlareChaser: run away
<thelonepony> objection to the objection AdamTheDuck Crakle is best pony
<sub06905> Also: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m39mgfAOGl1rv09a7o1_500.jpg
<AdamTheDuck> Objection to thelonepony's objection to my original objection, Tom is best pony.
<sub06905> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 7 days, 7 hours, 12 minutes, 14 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
<ILovepinkiePie> it is never a good thing to introduce too many characters into a established show
<thelonepony> AdamTheDuck: True :D
<naturesfury> that tom bot sigh
<ILovepinkiePie> and the sea ponies would be too much
<thegt90> thats too much http://cheezburger.com/6592252928
<scout19_tf2> well i gots to go hit the hay cya everypony:)
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight then scout19_tf2
<sub06905> bai scout19_tf2
<ILovepinkiePie> good night scout
<thelonepony> Night scout19_tf2 :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> You were chosen to choose what species from previous generations are going to come back in G4. There was elimination, and apparently, you can only choose Seaponies or Newborn Cuties. (The newborn cuties was most likely chosen by trolls.) What do you choose?
<FlareChaser> Well kids
<FlareChaser> Goodnight everyone!
<sub06905> hmm might pass out

<XAX> awesome.
<geeky> moo
<Kandarihu|Zoro> Alchemist, it's opened during official event streams. Mainly BMN. During episode streams, the main channel is closed, so that we're all forced to use one of these rooms
<Alchemist> Kandarihu|Zoro: I knew that, Im just saying that I dont know if kicking the usual method of closing the side rooms down.

<thelonepony> still bye :P
<Phase4> Sumica, now i cant get the other bits of the rover on
<Sumica> 00,10bugged part perhaps
<Phase4> at least once its done i can just dupe it
<Sumica> 00,10personaly i would just use the larger premade roavers
<soulero> step 2. i see what ingredients i have
<Sumica> 00,10dlip the part?
<Sumica> 00,10flip*
<Phase4> i will make this work
<Phase4> like a boss
<Phase4> kinda
<Sumica> 00,10I should get the deap space pack
<Sumica> 00,10dat torque
<AdamTheDuck> XD
<Phase4> well the rover made it out
<Sumica> 00,10just dont know what went wrong
<Phase4> one of its engines went away
<Sumica> 00,10got to get a crew to it
<Sumica> 00,10oh god more struts
<Sumica> 00,10they are not attaching
<Phase4> this should be fun
<Sumica> 00,10look at part list
<Phase4> awwww
<Sumica> 00,10they were not attached
<AdamTheDuck> TheRainbowDawn, interesting name. :P
<TheRainbowDawn> Was using it before ponies existed...
*TheRainbowDawn shrugs
<AdamTheDuck> TheRainbowDawn, that's what I was thinking, whether it's just Rainbow Dawns or referring to Rainbow Dash :P
<Phase4> perfect
<Phase4> kinda
<Phase4> i need engines which are gona be a pain
<TheRainbowDawn> Nah
<TheRainbowDawn> Rarity <3
*AdamTheDuck huggles TheRainbowDawn :P
*TheRainbowDawn huggles AdamTheDuck
<XAX> CHUGGA CHUGGA WOO WOO.
<Phase4> Perfect
<Phase4> so
<Phase4> i need to get this into space
<Phase4> so i can test things
<Phase4> hmmm
<AdamTheDuck> For science!~
<Phase4> should also make those warp clamps
<Phase4> incase i want to repurpose this as a space station
<Phase4> warp clamp needs to be other way round
<Phase4> litter the launch pad with rovers
<Phase4> i'm planing a long misson
<JRP2234> Phase4 play RoTT
<Phase4> hence the individually detachable rovers
<Phase4> JRP2234, :<
<JRP2234> Phase4 You played Rott before?
<Phase4> not a clue what it is
<infernap12> Hello all. Who's streaming?
<AdamTheDuck> Hello infernap12, Phase is.
<Phase4> ohai infernap12
<soulero> step 3. go to the shops to get unsalted butter, chocolate chips and eggs
<infernap12> hello
<soulero> see ya#
<AdamTheDuck> Bye soulero
<JRP2234> Phase4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_the_Triad im to lazy to explaine
<Phase4> wow, max thrust of 50
<Phase4> urgh, one sec
<JRP2234> Phase4 lets make baybs
<JRP2234> babys*
<JRP2234> Phase4 i found your address
<Phase4> and i'm back
<Spell-of-Gaming> Parting in IdleRPG is a bitch
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> Spell-of-Gaming, do what i do, stick a bot on it
<Phase4> i'm one of the top idlerpg players now
<Spell-of-Gaming> Planning to, actually.
<JRP2234> Phase4 shut up
<Spell-of-Gaming> I now have five and a half hours to accomplish.
<Sumica> 00,10btw Phase4, the Drop pods are not ballenced for that direction of travle
<Sumica> 00,10they are heavy on the door side
<JRP2234> mica but we like booms
<Phase4> that better?
<Colt_Silver> when pinkie was a little filly and the sun was going doooaaooowwnn]
<Sumica> 00,10well it's up to you Phase4, was just leting you know they are
<Sumica> 00,10I stuck 4 chuts on the side of one and droped it to test
<Phase4> Sumica, the more help the better, this is gona be hard to get into space
<Colt_Silver> Phase4: can it do a barrel roll?
<Sumica> 00,10I forsee much ducttape
<Phase4> Colt_Silver, i have no idea
<Sumica> 00,10and hal laughing his cerkets off
<Spell-of-Gaming> Since I turn off my computer, I just connect my Android to IdleRPG and leave it there when I need to sleep
<JRP2234> Spell-of-Gaming whats idlerpg
<Sumica> 00,10ohmy
<Moopy> Phase4 puts the rocket together LIKE A BOSS
<Sumica> 00,10btw gonna be a silly space station
<Phase4> its gona be a test station
<Sumica> 00,10warp couplers and hard vacume grids
<Spell-of-Gaming> OHMY
<Spell-of-Gaming> My McDonalds have Pokemon 5th Gen toys now
<Spell-of-Gaming> Including Victini
<soulero> IM BACK! with the eggs, choco chips and butttah
<Sumica> 00,10do you get fuel flow throught the trusses?
<Phase4> i have no idea
<Sumica> 00,10use the doungunt chutes
<Phase4> the which one?
<Sumica> 00,10the drop chute
<Phase4> wheres that?
<Phase4> oh i c
<Sumica> 00,10stick it on top
<soulero> step 5. preheat the oven to 170C, grease the baking tray or line wit parchment
<Sumica> 00,10it's a strange one
<Sumica> 00,10you need two
<Sumica> 00,10they deploy where it says danger
<Sumica> 00,10keep clear
<Phase4> ah
<Phase4> so thats why theres 3 points on the drop
<Sumica> 00,10the whol top of the ring blows off
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Phase4> its anoying that it covers the text
<Phase4> Sumica, does it have its own rcs or just use the stock blocks?
<Sumica> 00,10there is also an sas desgined to fit in side the ring with the rcs pods
<Sumica> 00,10got to use the blocks
<Phase4> i have no idea fi that is right
<Sumica> 00,10I would say no
<Sumica> 00,10should only need the one ring
<Sumica> 00,10let me fire mine up and screen snap
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> floating rcs
<XAX> Phase4: Awoken by WoodenToaster? :D
<Nofosos> what game is this?
<AdamTheDuck> Nofosos, Kerbal Space Program
<Phase4> should probably store them that way actually
<Nofosos> pretty neat
<Moopy> i try my best to break out the screams there haunting me in my dreams
<Sumica> 00,10http://screensnapr.com/v/TxwG17.jpg
<Phase4> Ah
<Sumica> 00,10that's an asas in the middle of the ring
<Phase4> that looks cool
<Sumica> 00,10the decoupler is optnal
<Sumica> 00,10but you need it if you have the cluster on the door side
<Sumica> 00,10that's why it's door heavy
<Sumica> 00,10to offset the cluster on the back side
<Phase4> ah
<Sumica> 00,10so no reactor on this?
<Sumica> 00,10gonna go solar?
<Phase4> its bloody heavy
<Phase4> figure i'll deal with solar
<Sumica> 00,10yeah for what I saw the best way to go reactor is to use warp couplers
<Moopy> hey night yall see yall in the mornings ok and thanks for the stream phase4 your great dude
<Sumica> 00,10boos the reactor to orbit with a diffrent glight
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Moopy
<Phase4> Sumica, that seems like an ok way to do it
<Sumica> 00,10flight
<Phase4> actually, if i'm doing that
<Sumica> 00,10basickly you shuttle the long range ship to orbit in many flights
<infernap12> i never asked, what the mission here?
<Phase4> infernap12, get this thing to space
<Phase4> once i know the problems, build a bigger one and fly it around the solar system
<Sumica> 00,10you have no real mission it's just a sandbox
<infernap12> are we landing on a planet or the mun or what?
<AdamTheDuck> infernap12, the mission is to find the most creative way to kill off your Kerbinaughts.
<Sumica> 00,10he's building a deep space flight
<infernap12> ahh
<Phase4> hmmm
<Phase4> Sumica, think i could make the engines detatchable and have a 'space tug'?
<Sumica> 00,10so right now it's mostly, can I get this much crap in to space
<Phase4> rearange it mid flight
<Sumica> 00,10worth a shot
<Phase4> worst it can do is explode
<Sumica> 00,10keep in mind you have to be able to man it
<Sumica> 00,10else you cant fly it
<Sumica> 00,10so you will need some kind of portaable C&C
<JRP2234> oh no
<JRP2234> i sorta made it in the nightly round up
*JRP2234 hides
<Phase4> i have no idea if i'm doing this right
<Sumica> 00,10no idea, I only know of the couplers in thiory
<Sumica> 00,10btw laser sucks
<Sumica> 00,10cant blow up any thing but it's self with it
<Phase4> that looks like an ok space station
<Phase4> i'll add to it later
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, where did I hear this song before?...
<Sumica> 00,10gonna take alot well other then the hard vacume truses
<AdamTheDuck> Mind if you link the song Phase4?
<JRP2234> Phase4 ahhh
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, not really but i'm concentrating on the craft today
<Phase4> Sumica, i have no idea how to get this to space XD
<JRP2234> Phase4 me name be in eqd
<Phase4> JRP2234, ?
<Sumica> 00,10I would say build somthing more suited as a cargo ship
<Sumica> 00,10and haull up parts
<Phase4> gona be funny if i get to space and the clamps are all wrong
<Phase4> Sumica, but then theres a lot of randevus to do
<Phase4> also i can't spell french
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Sumica> 00,10this thing i am not even sure can take the stress
<Sumica> 00,10thoes drops are heavy as fuck
<Phase4> wonder if i could get the orbital build hack thing
<Sumica> 00,10that would be cheating
<Phase4> true
<Sumica> 00,10if you are gonna do that just use the unbreakable shuttle parts
<Phase4> yeah, might be a good idea to take the drops up on seperate flights
<Sumica> 00,10I would realy like to see a lets play where you build a ship in orbit
<Phase4> where is that...
<Phase4> there it is
<Sumica> 00,10but you should be able to launch the base frame as one peice
<Phase4> cant go up without ma mechjeb
<Sumica> 00,10the hell is that?
<Sumica> 00,10is that like a hal?
<Phase4> Sumica, really good mod, adds a lot of info to the game that you kinda need
<Sumica> 00,10ahhh
<Phase4> well... probably, but hopefully it doesnt go evil
<Phase4> TO SPACE!
<Sumica> 00,10uhhhhh
<Sumica> 00,10you seem to be lacking bits
<infernap12> YEAH
<infernap12> SPACE
<Phase4> some of it survived
<Sumica> 00,10are those ions?
<Phase4> yeah
<Sumica> 00,10ions give shit thrust
<infernap12> lold
<Phase4> i'm not gona bother with kethane just yet
<Phase4> again, more randevus to do that
<Sumica> 00,10just use a good old detachable srb set
<Sumica> 00,10Ions are ment for in space only
<Sumica> 00,10and make sure you use a launch anchor so you dont fall over on the pad
<Sumica> 00,10oh god
<Spell-of-Gaming> Lolwut
<Sumica> 00,10titan rockets
<Phase4> this will explode
<Spell-of-Gaming> There's an article on WikiHow
<Spell-of-Gaming> "Find Your Dad for Free"
<Sumica> 00,10it's gonna crush it's cones
<Sumica> 00,10need launch anchor
<Phase4> oh awesome
<Phase4> 5 meter tanks
<Sumica> 00,10wut
<Sumica> 00,10dear god
<Phase4> i need bigger engine
<Sumica> 00,10dont we always
<JRP2234> mica
<Phase4> there it is
<Sumica> 00,10just cover it with scram jets
<Sumica> 00,10kinda lazy
<JRP2234> click upload on youtube mica and tell me if you get a error message
<Sumica> 00,10it's in read only mode
<Phase4> thats not gona be enough thrust
<Sumica> 00,10so uploads are disabled
<JRP2234> what
<JRP2234> are you signed in?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<JRP2234> FUCK YOU YOUTUBE THE ONE TIME I REALLY NEED TO UPLOAD
<JRP2234> Rubbish
<Sumica> 00,10use 4 of those Phase4
<Sumica> 00,10the big ones
<Phase4> these big engines cause lag
<JRP2234> mica try and accese your account settings
<infernap12> jrp: service unavailable
<JRP2234> FUCK
<Sumica> 00,10read only mode/ service unavable
<JRP2234> i get a Http/1.1 Service Unavailable
<infernap12> same
<Phase4> i got that earlier today
<Phase4> just wait it out
<JRP2234> maby its switching to the new youtube design
<Sumica> 00,10you should get the BFE mod then Phase4
<Phase4> xD
<Phase4> that would get something to space
<Sumica> 00,10you know the 60m rocket nozzle
<Sumica> 00,10you could put the whole launch platform in to space with it
<JRP2234> http://derpy.me/LxIEK <this very design
<infernap12> why cant use just use some srb s?
<Sumica> 00,10lets it it this way, I broke launch anchers with the BFE
<Sumica> 00,10so what happend?
<Phase4> it went up too hard
<MadSurge> Good morning Bronystate! :$
<Sumica> 00,10oh you crushed with air restance
<BroHoof> mornin MadSurge
<Phase4> no, drops tore it apart
<Sumica> 00,10ahhh
<Sumica> 00,10time for duct tape
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' MadSurge
<BroHoof> what is this game?
<Phase4> this is modded duct tape
<Phase4> stronger than original
<Phase4> BroHoof, kerbal space program
<BroHoof> Phase4: ah
<Sumica> 00,10nice thing about tapeing from the fuel tanks is the duct tape goes away when you jet the tank
<Sumica> 00,10they realy should make the solar pannles deployable
<Sumica> 00,10model them off the ladders
<Sumica> 00,10wobble wobble wobble
<Sumica> 00,10she's a bit slow
<BroHoof> success!
<XAX> Phase4: Can we get dat Awoken later? D:
<MadSurge> Hooray, Kerbal killing time! :D
<infernap12> not enough fuel
<Sumica> 00,10also no parachutes
<Phase4> camera bug
<BroHoof> why do i think something worng is gonna happen
<diddutz> mornin y'all
<MadSurge> Ohai diddutz!
<Sumica> 00,10cause he's only 20 ak up and out of fuel
<BroHoof> mornin' diddutz
<Sumica> 00,10er 30
<Sumica> 00,10there go the drops
<Phase4> everythings split apart
<AdamTheDuck> Hello diddutz
<Sumica> 00,10strange camera bug
<Sumica> 00,10try the tracking center Phase4
<diddutz> hi MadSurge, BroHoof and AdamTheDuck. How many kerbaly have you seen dieing today? ^^
<Sumica> 00,10might be able to lock the camera back on
<AdamTheDuck> diddutz, all the innocent kerbals.
<Phase4> yeah
<Phase4> cant get back though
<AdamTheDuck> ALL OF THEm.
<Phase4> ships accelerating
<Sumica> 00,10how>
<Phase4> bug
<BroHoof> diddutz: i only saw 3 dead i was here late :C
<Sumica> 00,10shep fell apart
<infernap12> that would scary as all hell
<Sumica> 00,10ah I see
<Sumica> 00,10your mass managed to carry you up
<Sumica> 00,10wait wut
<Sumica> 00,10you had 2 C&C?
<Phase4> space crew space
<Sumica> 00,10ahh
<Sumica> 00,10no rcs to try and go salvage the drops
<infernap12> what kind of graphics card do you have phase4 ?
<Phase4> why did this bug so hard
<Phase4> nvidia
<Phase4> something
<Sumica> 00,10falling?
<infernap12> he i gonna ded
<Sumica> 00,10there you go
<Phase4> too late either way
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Sumica> 00,10but that was what I was saying to try earlyer
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 crash? .-.
<Sumica> 00,10high G belly flop
<Phase4> huh
<Phase4> and then camera bug again
<Sumica> 00,10must be the warps
<Phase4> maybe
<AdamTheDuck> It was nice knowing you Wilsy Kerman.
<Sumica> 00,10I feel worse for the dude in orbit
<Phase4> so
<infernap12> perfect music
<Phase4> i need more power
<Phase4> more control
<Phase4> and less camera bug
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4... There's always room for more power.
<Sumica> 00,10better struts on the ions too
<Sumica> 00,10did you see all the flex
<AdamTheDuck> Tugging of the Strings <3
<AdamTheDuck> Oh God this was one of my first few Octavia inspired songs
<AdamTheDuck> Well, MLP inspired
<Sumica> 00,10wont those decouplers get in the way of the warp?
<Phase4> warp clamps are not going to work there
<Phase4> i'm also not sure you can use engines docked via clamp
<Sumica> 00,10they were thrusting
<Sumica> 00,10saw it at the end
<Phase4> were attached, not docked
<Sumica> 00,10ahh
<Phase4> hmm, more engine?
<Phase4> cant really power more engines
<Sumica> 00,10need more pannles?
<the_real_pony_1604> well, needs more power
<BroHoof> isn't that...to nuch
<BroHoof> much*
<the_real_pony_1604> you can never have too much power
<AdamTheDuck> BroHoof, there is never too much engine.
<BroHoof> AdamTheDuck, you make a good point there
<the_real_pony_1604> there is no replacement for displacement
<AdamTheDuck> If all else fails, just add more rockets.
<Phase4> its lagging in the vab :(
<AdamTheDuck> And duct tape.
<Sumica> 00,10still say the central hull has too much flex
<Phase4> probable
<the_real_pony_1604> press forward, Phase, nothing can go wrong
<Sumica> 00,10when the ions push they flex the truss work in
<MadSurge> And if it goes wrong at least you get a spectacular explosion :D
<Sumica> 00,10wont let you 4 way eh?
<Phase4> yeah
<Sumica> 00,10I realy hate the restrictions in the semitry
<Phase4> i figure
<Phase4> that if i can boost it high enough, i can orbit with the ions
<Sumica> 00,10aye
<Sumica> 00,10they got any vectoring?
<Phase4> yeah
<Phase4> plenty
<Phase4> its that camera bug that scares me
<the_real_pony_1604> I am ready to cue up Hope Vol 2 to play under when you launch this
<Sumica> 00,10looks ready
<Phase4> wont go high enough
<Phase4> too heavy
<Phase4> need more engine
<Sumica> 00,10srb time
<Phase4> a reactor might be a good idea actually
<BroHoof> wont the engine make it even morey
<Sumica> 00,10reactors gonna need a redesgine
<Phase4> ah well
<Phase4> yeah
<BroHoof> more heavy*
<Phase4> BroHoof, more fuel too
<BroHoof> Phase4, ah yea that's true
<Sumica> 00,10just bolt a couple dozen srb's on it
<Sumica> 00,10only 4?
<Sumica> 00,10there you go
<Phase4> wanted to put more liquid on but meh
<Sumica> 00,10two stacks of that
<Phase4> i could 2 meter tank
<Phase4> neah
<Phase4> nah'
<Sumica> 00,10liqued is for upper atmo
<BroHoof> damn ._. what are those
<Sumica> 00,10need SRB's to get you off the pad
<soulero> ze cookies are baking
<Sumica> 00,10staggr em
<Sumica> 00,10it's dead weight unlles they ar burning
<soulero> ready at 11:24-11:26
<Phase4> Sumica, not enough space, have to stage them either way
<alt_L_Y_R_A> i cant get on my L_Y_R_A profile for some reason...when i tried to log in it said "this name is in use"
<AdamTheDuck> alt_L_Y_R_A, use the ghost command
<Phase4> this is gona lag soo hard
<Sumica> 00,10cause it is in use
<JRP2234> eqd better post my thingy
<alt_L_Y_R_A> ghost?
<Sonny> heya everypony
<AdamTheDuck> /ns ghost username password
<AdamTheDuck> I think
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Sonny
<BroHoof> hiya Sonny
<alt_L_Y_R_A> ok...
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, can you link the other playlist? :3
<Sonny> dat spaceship °-°
<alt_L_Y_R_A> ...
<AdamTheDuck> alt_L_Y_R_A, now use /nick L_Y_R_A
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL6ZiviiNqA&feature=autoplay&list=PL031D216139D442A1&playnext=1
<alt_L_Y_R_A> ok...
*AdamTheDuck licks Phase4 "Thanks." :P
<L_Y_R_A> thx :P
<Sumica> 00,10and now you know how to ghost
<JRP2234> YOUTUBE WORK NOW
<Phase4> oh damn
<Phase4> no thrust vectoring on the ions
<Phase4> seems ready enough
<TheRandomkid321> Ahh I take it this is a good 'ol Phase4 Stream?
<L_Y_R_A> 0_0
<Phase4> inb4 EXPLOSIONS
<AdamTheDuck> >.< Turns out I already had this song downloaded >.>
<L_Y_R_A> DAAAAAAAAAMN...thats one big ship...
<Phase4> OH GOD LAG
*AdamTheDuck licks TheRandomkid321 again :P
*TheRandomkid321 Licks AdamThe... SONOFA
<AdamTheDuck> Yay explosions \:3/
<TheRandomkid321> So this time he is attenptiing to launch a sattelite?
<Phase4> huh
<Phase4> its not loading
<Phase4> There we go
<AdamTheDuck> lol the explosion is too awesome to load
<TheRandomkid321> dat Framerate
<AdamTheDuck> Epic music for an epic occasion.
<L_Y_R_A> yep :P
<BroHoof> uber lag
<Sumica> 00,10they over did the particals on those boosters
<TheRandomkid321> BroHoof Never seen you on before.
<Phase4> FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU
<BroHoof> TheRandomkid321, i'm on almost every day..almost
<Phase4> camera bug again
*AdamTheDuck watches Phase4 flip table
<L_Y_R_A> OH DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN
<diddutz> Phase4: How did you manage to break your altmeter? O.o
<Phase4> epic lag
<L_Y_R_A> THE MUSIC...THE GAME...SOO...INTENCE...
<TheRandomkid321> BroHoof Did you change your name? I swear to clestia i've never seen you on before... sorry... just for reasons previously expained I am being cautios of newcomers.
<Dark_Horst> was that makkon?
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, eeyup
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, it might be just timezone differances .-.

<L_Y_R_A> no...THE PLANET

<Ponies47> Phase4: Make rocket go ka-boom o3o

<Phase4> YES!
<Phase4> PARACHUTES ARE ACTIVE

<L_Y_R_A> YES...FLUTTERWOUNDER...HELL YEAH!!!!!!!11111!!!!!!!!!ONE1!!!!!!1
<HavokOC> ^
<XAX> DEEP WIDE BELL WONDER
<L_Y_R_A> ok...nuke the planet...
<Vivix> Flutterwonder, the first good ponysong I heard
<Vivix> what a wonderful world
<L_Y_R_A> hit the planet with the station >:3
<DerpyMuffins> I got a sinking feeling about this Phase4
<JRP2234> Phase4 im sorta on the nightly roundup at eqd
<Phase4> i've almost perfected it
<HavokOC> Flutterwonder, the reason why i started watching ponies
<HavokOC> lol
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins, i think the parachutes exploded cause of the time warp
<Phase4> so might be able to do that
<Phase4> JRP2234, neat
<L_Y_R_A> this is our weapon of last resort...phase...its time...
<alexxm> first pony thing i saw was the first antholgly
<Vivix> I've yet to see anthology
<Vivix> I listen to some ponymusic, and watch the show, read fanfics--but I tend not to watch fanvids-
<Vordox> Vivix: Canon, Fanon, or mix?
<L_Y_R_A> face the planet...then engage full thrusters...
<L_Y_R_A> time to end this...once and for all...
<DerpyMuffins> Wait, Vivix? As in the ShizukaXVivi?
<naturesfury> condor seems to be having a breakdown down there
<Vivix> Vordox in fanfics? Mix
<Ryunosuke> 20 minutes till ponies?
<Vivix> Oh nono, I'm not vivi
<Vordox> Vivix: I meant you :P
<Vivix> Wha ha ;__;?
<Vordox> Vivix: Are you a canon or fanon or mix(What feels the best)
<Vordox> For example, shipping
<Vivix> Oh, I prefer Heallthy huge dose of Canon, but- fanon based on canon is very fun
<Vivix> Major shipper
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<Vordox> Vivix: Octavia and Vinyl, what's their relation?
<Vivix> Depends on the fic, but in my headcanon, I'm not sure they know eachother
<L_Y_R_A> >:3 NUKE THE PLANET...
<Vordox> Vivix: Interesting....
<Vordox> Dr Whooves and Derpy?
<naturesfury> university days?
<Vivix> My bigggest difference from typical fanon is bon bon and lyra
<Vivix> Dr Whooves is time turner to me-
<Vordox> Vivix: Friends, or more? :P
<DerpyMuffins> DrXDerpy will never happen
<Vivix> To me, they don't know eachother
<Vordox> So, no pure fanon?
<DerpyMuffins> Its all about LunaXDerpy
<Ponies47> Aw yes this remix
<Vivix> Not much no
<Ponies47> I love this one <3
<Vivix> but it really depends, I can enjoy Derpyx TimeTurner, but- it's not my headcanon
<L_Y_R_A> bon bon X lyra will never happen...
<Vordox> Vivix: Derpy and Dinky?
*Vivix shrugs
<Vivix> HOnestly don't know
<Vordox> I see... Hmmm...
<Jmo> oi DashWithRainbows
<Vivix> but Bon bon and Lyra I consider near canon- as friends at least
<Jmo> oh Vivix is on
<Vivix> :3
<DashWithRainbows> wut
<Vordox> Vivix: iiiiinteresting!
<Jmo> got something to show you
<DashWithRainbows> wut u want?
<Jmo> TF2 related
<DashWithRainbows> orly?
<Vivix> We see them so many times, exchanging conversation, or carrying eachothers things-
<Ponies47> Sup DashWithRainbows
<L_Y_R_A> -_- they are JUST friends...
<Vivix> but I think their personalities are different than fanon, in my opinion
<Jmo> Sweet justice.
<Vivix> They aren't just anything, depends on the fic
<Jmo> Tsssssk
<Vordox> Vivix: Lyra +Hand Craze? :P
<Vivix> Don't like that
<DashWithRainbows> ohai Ponies47
<L_Y_R_A> LYRA AND BON BON ARE JUST FRIENDS...END...OF...STORY...
<Vivix> To me they're--maybe 24 ish, young, Bon bon has no steady employment, both are cultured and bon bon is a bit of a bitch-
<Vordox> Scootaloo is an orphan?
<Vivix> Maybe, I kinda like that angle
<Jmo> You're an orphan Vordox.
<Vordox> Jmo: Technically, I'm half orphan
<Vivix> but--no canon on it, so just maybe
<Vordox> But nevermind =P
<Jmo> O:
<Vordox> What about...
<Vordox> Luna + Pipsqueak?
<Vivix> Well, they know about eachother- and Pipsqueak think's Luna is awesome
<HavokOC> dis becoming radio for me, stream to laggy
<HavokOC> xD
<L_Y_R_A> LUNA...HERE WE COME...
<Vordox> Hehe =3
<Vordox> What about....
<Vordox> Wait WAIT
<Phase4> i'ma park this thing in munar orbit
<Vordox> You said something about Derpy and Whooves not knowing eachoother?
<Phase4> not much use orbiting kerbin
<Vordox> That's impossible
<Vivix> It is?
<Vordox> I recall one scene where they were talking to eachother
<Vivix> I haven't studied them much in the episodes
<Vivix> Ooh
<Vordox> brb
<L_Y_R_A> after you land somthing...hit the planet with the station...
<Vivix> Okay- they could very well be friends, yeah. And as I said, I don't mind shipping them, despite prefering male male and female female
<L_Y_R_A> nuke it...
<L_Y_R_A> end the war...
<Vivix> but- headcanon
<Vordox> Vivix: He reappears in Apple Bloom's imagination while running around in a panic, as well as in three village shots, once standing next to an unknown stallion and twice standing next to Derpy on the bridge
<Vivix> aah
<Vivix> They could be a couple- if Dinky is her daughter
<Vordox> And they were faces to eachother and standing still
<Phase4> close enough
<Vordox> Vivix: Don't go toof ar. :P
<Vivix> Hehe
<Jmo> wat.
<Vivix> but Dinky- I can't remember who she ran with in sisterhooves, if she did
<Vordox> She did.
<Vivix> but like Pinchy, I think she's more likely to be Berry's sister than her daughter
<Vivix> Because it was a sisterhooves social
<Vordox> Vivix: Dinky is also with Amethyst Star in Sisterhooves Social. The two of them compete in the titular Sisterhooves Social.
<Ryunosuke> hey Phase4 are you streaming? :p
<Phase4> Ryunosuke, yeah
<Vivix> Hm- so we could say they migh be sisters BUT Sweetie ran with 'Applejack'
<Ryunosuke> ah
<Vivix> so, they could just be friendly
<L_Y_R_A> yellow?...or gala?...
<Vordox> You know what's interesting Vivix ...
<Vordox> She has "derpy eyes" when staring at appleblooms loop-de-hoop skills, and are shown with and without horn during that episode... Should be mentioned here?Perhaps Derpy has gone a little to their heads? :)
<Vordox> Derpy eyes might be hereditary :P
<Vivix> hehe
<Vordox> Still...
<L_Y_R_A> HELL HEAH PIRATES OF CARIBEAN
<Vivix> Maaybe, but as with all bg ponies
<L_Y_R_A> nvm...
<Vivix> it can be hard to determine what is what
<Vordox> If I mix, I enjoy that Derpy has a daughter, but age wise, It's kinda...meh
<L_Y_R_A> kinda stopped...
<Phase4> i love the imposibly circular orbits mechjeb can get
<Vivix> none of it is hard-canon, but it is great material for fanon and headcanon
<Vivix> Yeah, I enjoy that she might have a daughter, but I think-- she probably doesn't
<Vordox> Vivix: Sisters are fine, lorewise and Fanon.
<Vordox> BUt... We don't know much about Derpy.
<Phase4> XD wonder if mechjeb could land this thing
<Vordox> Except that speaking role(HER FIRST VOICE FTW)
<Vivix> hehe
<Phase4> i think i'ma call it a night
<Vivix> We know very little about most
<DerpyMuffins> Alright Phase4 night
<L_Y_R_A> DONT
<Phase4> i meen i got thsi thing into orbit
<Phase4> not only orbit
<Vivix> the one we kinda can glean a lot of personality from is Bon bon, and any of the others who have spoken
<Phase4> munar orbit
<L_Y_R_A> CRASH INTO THE PLANET FIRST
<HavokOC> Phase, some friends played that before
<Nofosos> luna orbit
<Phase4> L_Y_R_A, crashing doesnt do much
<L_Y_R_A> NUKE THE KERBALS
<HavokOC> We accidently made the pilots fly out of the galaxy to never return
<Vordox> Vivix: And don't forgot ONE particular hated pony
<Vordox> Vivix: The Southern Valley one
<SnipsandSnails> What's this?
<Ryunosuke> http://coltsteelstallion.deviantart.com/art/human-facts-335695871 -- L_Y_R_A NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

<Sonny> say, did sombody with the name klalaskaxD or somthing like that came along recently?
<Vivix> Turf I think is the one with palm cutiemark
<L_Y_R_A> ive hated more...
<Vivix> In that episode we get to know bon bon a little more too
<SnipsandSnails> who's surf and turf?
<Vordox> Vivix: Wait, you already know Surf and Turf
<Vordox> XD

<infernap12> did stream end?
<HavokOC> Stream ded

<HavokOC> hay nitt
<Vordox> Vivix: Who is Shoeshine then? :P
<Vivix> Ooh I can't tell without cheating ;__; but I've seen the name
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hey Havok.
<Vivix> but looking at her image-
<Vordox> Vivix: Who hasn't seen the names. XD
<Jmo> Vordox, Shoeshine is Shoeshine
<Jmo> What do i win?
<Sonny> Ponies47: d'aaahww D:
<SnipsandSnails> Shoeshine http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VgGR5SItGIM/T2qyM3J02oI/AAAAAAAAIJg/OPrzj8eiqK4/s1600/UNDERDOG%2BSHOESHINE%2BBOY%2BCOIN%2BBITE.jpg
<Vivix> Did she cut in line infront of Fluttershy?
<Vordox> Jmo: Where does she has a speaking rol? :P
<Vordox> Vivix: eyup
<Vivix> Woo
<Vivix> She was cute-
<Vivix> but I never noticed her before then
<Jmo> be more specific fool ;__;
<Ponies47> Sonny: :<
<Sonny> Sweetie Belle is so cute :>
<SnipsandSnails> ^
<Ponies47> brb
<Vordox> Vivix: She has 4 speaing roles
<Vordox> Which is ALOT for a BG pony
<Vordox> Name ONE
<Vivix> Really? Yeah that is a lot-
<Vivix> okay
<Vivix> Raven!
<Vordox> Raven?O.o
<Vivix> My headcanon on her is totally based on nothing,
<Vivix> and I just recently learned her name
<J_E_Smith71> ...and Sumi overslept again
<Vordox> Wait, Shoeshine
<Vordox> wha?
<Sonny> knock knock
<alexxm> is the stream still on
<Vivix> Nono, Raven
<Vivix> Very strange name, in my opinion, but that was the fanon name apparently
<Vordox> Woot?
<Sonny> *knock* *knock*
<Vivix> In my head she's Mayor Mare's assistant, Just because she was sitting next to her-
<Vordox> Vivix: Er...
<Vordox> Vivix: I think she got her name in the upcoming S3
<Vordox> =P
<SnipsandSnails> <------ Everyone hates those two characters. But I don't.
<Vordox> So I can't dvelwe deep here
<Vivix> Well, I didn't read that far
<Vivix> but yeah I did see she was mentioned there
<Vordox> SnipsandSnails: I don't hate them, at all. They add some hasty kids :P
<Ponies47> back
<Vordox> Vivix: Oh wait, she hasn't gotten it.
<Vivix> I'm not a fan of them, but- I don't hate them
<Vordox> BUt yeah, Raven. :P Isn't she familiar to someone else too.. as ec
<Ponies47> SnipsandSnails: I was once 5 feet away from the guy who voices Snips
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> She does look like eh..that political woman
<Squallken> is there something wrong with the stream or is it just me?
<Dken2021> oh, phase done?
<SnipsandSnails> hmmm...interesting...
<J_E_Smith71> Is Sumica here? Just came on late and since the stream's blank I thought he wasn't here
<J_E_Smith71> Or did Sumi ninja the stream and we're having problems?
<infernap12> i belive its something like 5 am where sumica
<infernap12> is
<SnipsandSnails> The guy that voices Snails is the same guy that voices Inuyasha
<Vivix> I think my favourite-- bg pony design might be Amethyst Star, but it might be because of her voice and colour-scheme
<Ponies47> J_E_Smith71: Phase4 was streaming before and then he just stopped all of a sudden :/
<Sonny> is the stream on?
<Sonny> oh
<Sonny> nvm
<Sonny> >_>
<J_E_Smith71> Ponies47 infernap12: yeah but Sumi's supposed to be running pony eps now
<Vordox> Vivix: My favourite BG Pony
<Vordox> Applejack
<Sonny> mines Pinkie Pie
<Vivix> Hehe
<Sonny> mine's*
<SnipsandSnails> Either Derpy or Vinyl.
<Ponies47> J_E_Smith71: He is? Oh maybe that's why. Mabye Sumi is just setting up or something
<Dark92Enigma> My favorite is Twilight Sparkle
<Dken2021> hehe, can't wait for the sudden high traffic next friday
<Vivix> I dunno- I don't really count Derpy when I think abo that, dunno why
<Dark92Enigma> <3 TWILY
<DocSane> Dragon Quest is playing on TV right now.
<Vivix> my favourite BG pony is probably Amethyst or Rose- those two have hte prettiest colours
<J_E_Smith71> Ponies47: Yeah but it's live off the Hub, so we're missing the ep
<Dken2021> Amethyst?
<Dark92Enigma> But best background pony is :P
<Vivix> Amethyst Star
<Ponies47> J_E_Smith71: Oh yeah *Sadface*
<shadowboy8456> ...hey all
<Vivix> pony who was opening jar of..pickles on picnic
<infernap12> vinyl scratch by far, she just looks too awesome
<Dken2021> oh, that purple one
<Ponies47> Hey shadowboy8456
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: Wait what?
<Vivix> I dunno- her fanon kinda made me not enjoy her as much
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: ?
<Vordox> The cards were designed specifically with the brony demographic of older fans in mind, and the writer-consultant for the set has said the consultants submitted "at least a dozen direct fandom nods"
<SnipsandSnails> Hayseed TurnipTruck
<Vivix> but she does look badass
*Vordox win pose
<shadowboy8456> what;s the question?
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: you were talking with J_E_Smith71 about the Hub
<Sonny> lol AJIsAwesome|Asleep how can he have typed that when he is asleep xD
<Vordox> Vivix: Who?
<Dken2021> Vordox those cards that were CaD?
<HavokOC> Is it just me or is stream dead?
<Vivix> Vordox Vinyl
<Vordox> Vivix: Ah. :P A second
<shadowboy8456> dtream is dead
<shadowboy8456> stram
<Vordox> Dken2021: CaD? I think they were official
<Vivix> Enterplay cards? Those are great
<HavokOC> damn
<Vivix> there were some CaD cards, but no not those
<J_E_Smith71> Dark92Enigma: Sumi's supposed to stream the pony reruns right now but he's not here. Must have had problems or he overslpet again
<Dken2021> which cards are you talking about?
<Vivix> Enterplay?

<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 7 days, 0 hours, 44 minutes, 32 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
<Vivix> I won't be disappointed by S3, because- my expectations will probabl be met, as it is only "more ponies" I expect and demand
<shadowboy8456> ok
<CrimsonPhoenix> IN 44 MINUTES
<shadowboy8456> and seven days
<Jmo> Quit demanding Vivix.
<Jmo> Go to your room.
<CrimsonPhoenix> There's going to be one week left full

<Vordox> Vivix: Read the whole 3 page series? :P
<Vivix> yeaah finished now
<Vivix> Badass derpy

<DashWithRainbows> Pfft, you can have your stoopid ponies
<DashWithRainbows> I'll have mah Halo 4.
<Jmo> DWR pls go.
<Vivix> Halo!?
<Colt_Brovakiin> ^
<Jmo> pls go.
<Colt_Brovakiin> :3
<DashWithRainbows> Lolno
<Jmo> NOW.
<DashWithRainbows> This place needs more SWAG
<Vivix> I remember when everyone was making jokes about Halo, before CoD became a joke
<Jmo> YOLOSWAG?
<DashWithRainbows> I'm here to delivar it
<SnipsandSnails> SWAG is for FAGS
<Dken2021> what is it with dolan and broken grammar?
*Vivix sucks dick
<HavokOC> dash, go strem
<Jmo> YOLOSWAG
<Jmo> Haters wanna be me.
<DashWithRainbows> SWAG is for cigarettes?
<DashWithRainbows> kk
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vivix, you mean how Halo invented FPS?
<HavokOC> :3
<DashWithRainbows> I am cigarette nao
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause it did
<Vivix> Yeah jokes like that
<DashWithRainbows> HavokOC Me? Stream?
<DerpyMuffins> Might I ask what Halo is?
<DashWithRainbows> No thanks
<SnipsandSnails> SWAG = Secretly We Are Gay
<Jmo> LOl
<Vivix> People would say all sorts of things, exaggerated
<HavokOC> Silly dash, cigarettes can't irc
<Dken2021> DerpyMuffins he's a pretty cool guy
<Vivix> like that--video where people smash Halo and snort it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Also Vivix that's because Halo was actually decent
<Jmo> oh god
<Jmo> Egoraptor
<Vivix> It was decent, but people made joks about it
<Vivix> around Halo2
<CrimsonPhoenix> 2 was still good but not great
<DashWithRainbows> DerpyMuffins A CoD ripoff
<DashWithRainbows> but a good one
<CrimsonPhoenix> Halo 3 though oh dear
<Vivix> I never finished Halo2
<CrimsonPhoenix> the only good thing in Halo 3 was the forge
<Vivix> and never played it again
<DashWithRainbows> ....
<Jmo> Your space bar is broken Vivix.
<DashWithRainbows> CrimsonPhoenix
<DashWithRainbows> pls go
<DashWithRainbows> nao
<SnipsandSnails> I haven't played Halo I don't play video games that much
<Vivix> It is Jmo? ;__;
<Jmo> Halo2
<infernap12> i dont play halo for game
<Jmo> There is a space.
<infernap12> i play it for the story
<Vivix> Ooh
<Vivix> Halo^2
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just said Halo 3 was the weaker one of the series really
<DerpDash> Hey Everypony! :) It's been awhile
<Jmo> >_>
<DashWithRainbows> Yeah, no, CrimsonPhoenix.
<Jmo> I will hurt your goaticorns Vivix.
<Vivix> Noo!
<DashWithRainbows> You obviously didn't play ODST
<CrimsonPhoenix> well if you don't count ODST
<Vivix> They're my lovely ladies ;__;
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai DerpDash :)
<Jmo> You have no ladies.
<infernap12> i loved ODST
<DashWithRainbows> Halo 3 is high on my Halo list
<Vivix> Fiiine...Maaares then
<infernap12> what of it
<DashWithRainbows> Right below Halo 1.
<DashWithRainbows> Can't beat the classic
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't count it because that cannot be a legitimate Halo game in my book
<Jmo> wut about Flash Halo DWR
<Vivix> I only ever played the MP
<Jmo> Dat shit is da bomb.
<Dken2021> I've only tried halo 1 and that was like around 4-5 years ago
<Vivix> with friends on Xbox
<SnipsandSnails> I just got my Xbox do I guess I just need to get more games
<AttackWithHugs> Morning.
*Jmo huggles AttackWithHugs
<Jmo> Morning :3
<Dken2021> mornin AttackWithHugs :3
<DashWithRainbows> If you have a good gaming PC, you don't need a console
<CrimsonPhoenix> Also DashWithRainbows my opinion is totaly and definitely better than yours
<DashWithRainbows> well
<Colt_Brovakiin> hai AttackWithHugs :3
<DashWithRainbows> Pfft
<DashWithRainbows> You're a chav
<DashWithRainbows> u have no opinion
<DashWithRainbows> :>
<Vordox> OH MY GOD
<Vordox> The "Cutie Mark Crusaders Chocolate Popcorn" recipe's accompanying illustration depicts grown-up versions of the Cutie Mark Crusaders with cutie marks,
<Vordox> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<SnipsandSnails> Red Dead Redemption is the only game I have right now
<Vivix> Which is fanart
<AttackWithHugs> Hi Jmo, Dken2021, and Colt_Brovakiin4
<Vivix> Vordox, it was just fanart-
<Jmo> How're you doing flufffeh
<Vordox> Vivix: It's made by ONE of the creator of the show
<Vivix> before she was hired
<Vordox> =P
<Vivix> no, it was made by an animator
<AttackWithHugs> Jmo, just waking up.
<Vivix> who was hired after drawing the picture
<Jmo> Huzzah for awakening
<Vivix> it's not considered canon because of it
<Vivix> Though, shouldn't be hard to guess their cutiemarks
<Vordox> Vivix: awww
<Vordox> McDonald's of Germany held a contest in early 2012, titled "Mein Burger 2012", asking customers to create and name their own sandwich. One of the sandwiches that made the finals is called "Scootaloo", a chicken sandwich, named by its creator after the character from the series
<Vordox> :P
<Jmo> Guess what? They're never gonna get one.
<SnipsandSnails> Okay...now I'm scared
<Vivix> Eating Scootaloo..not quite what I imagined
<Dken2021> :O
<CrimsonPhoenix> DashWithRainbows, but seriously though our opinions and etc, I do agree with you that ODST is really the biggest joke of the series, I've actually forgot about it
<Jmo> Vivix, stop right there.
<DashWithRainbows> Yeah..
*Vivix stops
<Jmo> Just don't go any further then that >_>
<DashWithRainbows> Halo wars was a better game than ODST
<DashWithRainbows> Not a bad shot at an RTS
<Dken2021> wasn't ODST a RTS?
<DashWithRainbows> No
<Dken2021> oh
<Jmo> LOL?
<DashWithRainbows> FPS
<Jmo> wat.
<CrimsonPhoenix> DashWithRainbows, for concoles
<Vivix> if you pronounce the abbreviation as ARE TEE ESS it should be an RTS
<DashWithRainbows> Halo wars could've use a free build system.
<Jmo> Scarabs in Halo Wars
<Jmo> ,3
<Jmo> <3
<DashWithRainbows> ^
<Jmo> Oh the joy of wrecking shit with them.
<DashWithRainbows> Wasn't Forge's superior unit called the "Grizzly" or something?
<DashWithRainbows> I can't remeber
<infernap12> oh the anoyance of getting owned by two of them
<Jmo> Something like that
<DashWithRainbows> I know that it was badass
<Vivix> so halo exists on PC?
<Jmo> Halo 1/2
<infernap12> 1 and 2
<Vivix> Ah
<Jmo> They should put Halo Wars on PC
<killerpony7733> Funny halo was PC at first then suddenly XBOX
<infernap12> other way round
<CrimsonPhoenix> I actually got the 2nd one on PC
<Vordox> ....
<Vordox> http://glamourkat.deviantart.com/gallery/28728328#/d49i5h9
<Vordox> Jean Luck Ponicard
<Jmo> klrpwny wat.
<TheBadger> FOr the longest time, I referred to Halo as "The Traitor"
<Jmo> how was halo PC first
<Jmo> .-.
<infernap12> November 15, 2001 as a launch title for the Xbox gaming system
<TheBadger> and infernap, no, Halo was ORIGINALLY supposed to be a PC game\
<Vivix> Wiki it
<SnipsandSnails> oh...my god. My friend is trying to get all the LPS toys at Mcdonalds....If they were ponies I would be interested.
<Bronysith> morning crazy bastards
<DashWithRainbows> Oi
<infernap12> wiki says xbox and pc two years later
<DashWithRainbows> I'm not a bastard.
<DashWithRainbows> >:l
<Jmo> You're a bastard DWR.
<Dken2021> SnipsandSnails isn't it the same?
<Jmo> Sup
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: what do you want to be then?
<TheBadger> Then when X-box was announced, they switched it to X-Box
<DashWithRainbows> Don't say bad things about yourself, Joomay
<DashWithRainbows> it isn't nice
<CrimsonPhoenix> SnipsandSnails, he's getting updated with the time, better you should join
<Vivix> All english are bastards, because it sounds so damn awesome in their accent
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: how about insane guy # 12334213e543
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Bronysith
<Jmo> Ahahahahahah
<DashWithRainbows> whatever
<Lil_B> hi everyone :)
<Vordox> Vivix: What do you think about this character?
<Vordox> http://glamourkat.deviantart.com/gallery/28728328#/d3fmok3
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: crazy bastard it is
<DashWithRainbows> ...
<Vivix> Gilda?
<SnipsandSnails> If I see the first episode. And it's good. Then I'll probably get one.
<Vivix> She's mean, frustrated, probably insecure- attractive but--veryyyy abbrasive and angry
<OneTrickPony|Zzz> good morning everyone^_^
<Vordox> Vivix: From what little we saw of her =3
<TheBadger> But yeah, Halo is a traitor to Master PC Gaming Race, but we forgive it, because it got a PC release EVENTUALLY
<Vordox> Frustratred?
<Vordox> How so?
<Vivix> She seems to be-
<SnipsandSnails> Gilda should be in S3
<Vivix> She clings to RD- and she's kind of- not interested in knowing anyone else
<HavokOC> nice gilda
<Vivix> or being friendly to anyone else
<Vordox> Aha
<Vordox> Don't want to break routine.
<Vordox> I can see that
<Vivix> to me it sounded like she was frustrated with whatever is going on in her life, and running away to see old friends
<HavokOC> what if suddenly nice gilda
<Cowboy> i think she died
<Vordox> Speaking about RAINBOW DASH
<Vordox> http://glamourkat.deviantart.com/gallery/28728328#/d3al5sd
<DashWithRainbows> Ew
<Vordox> Vivix: I got to watch closer, I missed that.
<DashWithRainbows> Non-Luna/Celestia alicorn
<Jmo> Oh god
<DashWithRainbows> Ewwwww
<DashWithRainbows> Go away
<Vivix> It might be my imagination
<SnipsandSnails> And she apologizes to :'( and :D and :O
<DashWithRainbows> Oh wait, forgot Cadence.
<DashWithRainbows> She cool
<Vivix> but- I also think Rarity is insecure
<DashWithRainbows> :>
<Cowboy> yeah
<Jmo> You wish you were cool ashie-poo
<Vordox> Vivix: Well she's a career woman. :P
<DashWithRainbows> I am cool
<Jmo> Nahp
<DashWithRainbows> I sleep in a freezer
<DashWithRainbows> I'm so cool
<Jmo> Pfft
<Vivix> In sweet and elite she denies herself, and despite knowing the WINNER of the best young flier, she doesn't see that as something impressive coming from her and lies
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: cold even?
<killerpony7733> Vivix I think the 2nd option cause it's a childrens cartoon i doubt they put that much thought into it
<TheBadger> Fun thing. Griffins are thrown from their nest to teach them how to fly. Until she learned to fly, she wouldn't be able to go home. ANother fun fact, Griffins that smell of another species are shunned.
<Vivix> that's a lazy response killerpony7733
<DashWithRainbows> Well, I have been known to be cold towards children...
<DashWithRainbows> So yeah
<DashWithRainbows> I'm cold.
<Jmo> No, you're heartless.
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: like that one guy from Dusks Dawn
<Vordox> Vivix: One of the reason I don't like Rarity :P
<Vivix> I love her- I think she's great
<Vordox> Speaking about PONIES...well duh
<Vordox> http://glamourkat.deviantart.com/art/Seapony-Template-185765061?q=gallery%3Aglamourkat%2F28728328&qo=23
<Vordox> YAY!
<Jmo> One of the main reasons you have no friends.
<Jmo> :>
<DashWithRainbows> Why can't I have a heart made of ice, Joomay?
<DerpyMuffins> Heart of ice DashWithRainbows?
<killerpony7733> Vivix Still why would they add such adult emotions and all to a childrens cartoon?
<DashWithRainbows> So much cooler.
<Vivix> but I think she doesn't believe her own achievements or relations are good enough
<Jmo> cuz
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: you interested in playing Phantasy star online?
<Jmo> u suk
<Vivix> killerpony7733, because it's written by adults?
<DashWithRainbows> Nope
<DashWithRainbows> U blow, Joomay
<TheBadger> WHy would they put alchohol in a cartoon, Killer?
<Jmo> not anymore
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: prepare for assimilation
<Vivix> we put feeling into whatever we do, because otherwise we get bored
<Jmo> dabi n me r ova
<Jmo> remba
<DashWithRainbows> Oh yeah
<Vivix> people who think it don't matter because childrens target demographic, are the people who write shitty fanfics and try to get away with it
<DashWithRainbows> u ran to Ponies47 and Ninjazz
<SnipsandSnails> Pinkie can be annoying sometimes, Rarity is full of herself, and Rainbow Dash is even more full of herself.
<DashWithRainbows> Oh
<killerpony7733> Vivix Completely missing the point it's mean't to be a childrens cartoon yes hints of these emotions are there but it's usually at such a level it's nothing mostly
<DashWithRainbows> And Panda
<DashWithRainbows> :>
<Ponies47> DashWithRainbows:
<Ponies47> ?
<Jmo> What about Pondoo?
<DashWithRainbows> they suk
<Vivix> No, it's probably there, whether or not intentionally doesn't matter
<DashWithRainbows> just like you
<Jmo> meh
<Jmo> You still stink.
<Vivix> we're discussing a perceival, so that basically bypasses intention, doesn't it?
<Jmo> No matter what,.
<DashWithRainbows> Meh
<DashWithRainbows> You would make a great Dyson
<Ponies47> DashWithRainbows: You no like me :<
<DashWithRainbows> Nope
<Jmo> Lawl
<DashWithRainbows> I hate everything.
<Jmo> He doesn't like anyone.
<Jmo> Foooool.
<DashWithRainbows> Even myself.
<TheBadger> you....would make....a good......DAlek
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: you're not meanwhile
<Vivix> Meanwhile loves us, he's just too bitter to show it
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/AQRIRj5-19M WELP
<Bronysith> hes a hedgehog Vivix
<DashWithRainbows> I know, Meanwhile shares his honest opinion though
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> but yeah I think Rarity can be very insecure, in certain aspects of her life, and that makes her interesting
<SnipsandSnails> People actually ship Applejack and Applebloom O_O and Rarity and Sweetie Belle
<Vivix> So much effort into what other thinks of her, that it is more important than what she thinks herself
<DashWithRainbows> Pfft
<DashWithRainbows> Please
<Vivix> ofcourse SnipsandSnails
<Bronysith> my friend tells me applejack is one dimensional, not her fault the writers give her no episodes for development
<DashWithRainbows> Well
<DashWithRainbows> She is a background pony
<Vivix> doesn't matter what people tell you, what you see is what matters
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: true
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rarity is best pony
<DashWithRainbows> Nah
<Vivix> I adore Rarity-
<DashWithRainbows> Tom is.
<Vordox> Vivix:
<Vordox> VIVIV
<Vordox> VIVIX!*
<Vordox> http://sibsy.deviantart.com/gallery/36005288#/d4ygtyx <---
<Vivix> WAHUH?
<CrimsonPhoenix> DashWithRainbows, but Tom is with Rarity
<CrimsonPhoenix> and heck Rarity named Tom
<Vivix> Hehehe
<DashWithRainbows> Tom is a giant diamond, he will last for centuries.
<DashWithRainbows> Rarity won't.
<DashWithRainbows> :>
<Vivix> Did you listen to their conversation?
<Vivix> It was strange
<Vivix> Something about--hooficure "But all my friends are getting iit!"
<SnipsandSnails> I'm watching Gravity Falls.
<DashWithRainbows> Good boy.
<Vordox> Vivix: XD I know where that convo is goin
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> I like listenign to the bg ponies
<Vordox> Ooooh
<Vordox> http://sibsy.deviantart.com/art/I-Reget-Everything-320375053?q=gallery%3Asibsy%2F36005288&qo=1
<Vordox> YAY
<Vivix> I also LOVE Cheerilee's expression when Sweetie Bell asks her how she can be single
<Vordox> A Crossover(Or not)
<Bronysith> what games, shows, comics, that have pretty good content, but the fans of said games, comics, anime, are all terriblle
<Vivix> Many
<SnipsandSnails> Cheerilles like "oh my fckin god..."
<Vivix> "not this again"
<Dken2021> Bronysith too many to count
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/tWBA2LCjnlM
<Vivix> It implies so much about Cheerilee
<Vivix> in my headcanon she's gayer than gay, but--heeey bias, how you doin'
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1351951102446.jpg

<J_E_Smith71> So who here has SuperBrony's twitter feed open in another tab and keeping track of him at EQLA?
<Saturn> 08,01Rex_Mundi: i have my... own opinions, but i shan't share them in here
<killerpony7733> HoodyNinja Actually people said yes to it but since it pokes the rules hard theres a reason why he has gotten stream ban
<StinkomanFan> They showed the Episode of Penn and Teller about Pornogrophy
<killerpony7733> ^
*Jmo pokes AttackWithHugs "We can rebuild it :3"
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, VGA
<FlutterMEDIC> gtg, going to see Wreck-It Ralph
<RaveBrony> What was it about? I dont realy know the show. Did it SHOW porn, the making of porn, what? O.o
<HoodyNinja> FlutterMEDIC: TAKE ME WITH U
<Kandarihu> Penn and Teller did an episode of Bull**** defending porn from the concerns that they could dispute. It included actual clips of porn.
<RaveBrony> Oh
<killerpony7733> Yeah but however whilst everyone was okay with it it's again a bit of a big rule breaker
<RaveBrony> Well damn
<Friendchips> Oh.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh dear anthro
<FlutterMEDIC> y u no say goodbye!?
<RaveBrony> When was he banned?
<CrimsonPhoenix> RaveBrony, oct 18th
<RaveBrony> Noted!
<Rex_Mundi> Sumica: I just hope you guys dont have negative feelings with each other.
<Kandarihu> killerpony7733, I wan't okay with it, and I think there were some complaints from people brave enough to actually complain
<StinkomanFan> So... is this Sweetie Belle?
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix I don>'t recalkl a joke about hthem, (other than they usually aren't taken seriously by true gamers)
<CrimsonPhoenix> My little Schoogirl
<StinkomanFan> Scootaloo?
*AttackWithHugs hands Jmo a pillow
<FlutterMEDIC> btw, methinks its Fluttershy
<StinkomanFan> Apple Bloom?
<HoodyNinja> This might not be a pony...
<Jmo> That's ze spirit fluffy :3
<DerpyMuffins> You drawing Domo?
<Ragnano> i dunno who it is, but it looks adorable :3
<Friendchips> I think it is Flutters too
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, the VGA is horrible and the whole concept is shamefull to the average gamer
<DerpyMuffins> Please be filly Twilight
<CrimsonPhoenix> like G4tv
<GilDash> I was going to say: Wasn't the reason Wrek banned himself precisely *because* there were some people who complained?
<DerpyMuffins> Or not
<Wubstep> xP
<Mega_Milk> GilDash: He banned himself????
<Rex_Mundi> Wait, Wrek is the one that banned Wrek?
<Mega_Milk> GilDash: Like quit?
<HoodyNinja> BANCEPTION
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu Why in the heck would anyone not say anything about it? wrek wouldn't do anything fi they didn't say yes. But point is the vote was show it but again rule breaker so understandable
<GilDash> Rex_Mundi: He basically imposed the ban on himself from what I understand.
<infernap12> your talkign to phase?
<killerpony7733> Mega_Milk Not permanently just for a month
<infernap12> ask him why he left without saying goodbye
<SpeccyRush> November 18th
<sub06905> wait why did wrek ban himself?
<Friendchips> Scootaloo.
<Mega_Milk> killerpony7733: Ah ok thats more acceptable.
<GilDash> Mega_Milk: For one month. 18th October until 18th November.
<Friendchips> Nope. Twilight?
<HoodyNinja> Ohey, a pony
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not sure if anyone complained or not, actually
<Ragnano> that's better!
<Saturn> 08,01but it was decided by the admins that he was streaming inappropriate content
<GilDash> I missed the whole thing either way, just caught what was said last night.
<Saturn> 08,01so he was banned from streaming for a month
<StinkomanFan> Doll?
<killerpony7733> Saturn 99% of the chat from what i saw that day said yes. Fair is fair though
<DerpyMuffins> So Wrek is banned till the 18th?
<Saturn> 08,01DerpyMuffins: from streaming, yes
<Saturn> 08,01he can still come in the caht
<Saturn> 08,01*chat
<DerpyMuffins> Just streaming?
<Kandarihu> Well this was hardly the only thing Wrek showed that I had a problem with. I'm VERY uncomfortable with Eddie Izzard being shown on here, but the general rule is that I'm not supposed to complain about the stream at all, because I'm not paying in to it, and I should just pause or mute the stream if I'm personally offended by it's contents.
<StinkomanFan> Is this Pound Cake or Carrot Cake?
<Friendchips> Yep this is filly Twi
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: what's wrong with Eddie Izzard?
<DerpyMuffins> Who is it Domo?
<GilDash|NaNo> Looks like I've picked a good time to avoid the following conversations...
<Kandarihu> Saturn, I really don't want to go in to it.
<Vivix> Kandarihu the rules is don't whine about stream if the stream isn't breaking rules
<Vivix> whining is disrespectful to the streamer, and we don't do it
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: well, it's hardly against the rules to stream transvestite comedy
<Vivix> ^^
<XxNightHawk64xX> is this song from megaman x 7/8
<J_E_Smith71> Nice piano version of Smile Smile Smile going on on EQLA stream
<DerpyMuffins> Brb everypony, gotta reset my router
<Friendchips> Bye DerpyMuffins
<HoodyNinja> Okay, i gotta clean my snakes cage, bbl
<BladedWings|HW> Good afternoon everypony, how we doing today? :)
<StinkomanFan> But it was so cute... Even if I had no clue what it was
<Colt_Brovakiin> Good afternoon BladedWings|HW :)
<Friendchips> Watching someone draw. Afternoon BladedWings
<Kandarihu> Ironically, covering up the stream and muting it IS what I personally did over the porn episode. But this does run against the streaming rules.
<HoodyNinja> latas
<Ragnano> hello BladedWings|HW
<Vivix> That's not ironic though
<Vivix> when we see something we don't like in stream, we don't watch it
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: how's that ironic?
<Dark92Enigma> be right back everypony, gone to shopping
<Colt_Brovakiin> Bye Dark92Enigma :)
<Vivix> when something that isn't supposed to be streamed, it is breaching the. Doesn't matter if we complain or not
*BladedWings|HW hugs Colt_Brovakiin Friendchips and Ragnano ^_^
<BladedWings|HW> bye Dark92
*Colt_Brovakiin huggles BladedWings|HW back :3
<Friendchips> bye everypony. Gonna look for mulia Mild fanart
<StinkomanFan> Either Blueblood or Fancy Pants...
<BladedWings|HW> bye Chips
<Colt_Brovakiin> Bye Fri-
<Colt_Brovakiin> gone
<XxNightHawk64xX> anyone know when mlp fighting is magic is coming out
<infernap12> i need to another monitor just for bronystate
<infernap12> buy
<p4ngya> XxNightHawk64xX: i would say in about a year
<XxNightHawk64xX> oh
<Kandarihu> There are things that go on, even in that very show, that I need to respond to... come to think of it, I think I had the stream unmuted and was responding to the ideas there as well.
<XxNightHawk64xX> wow
<Saturn> 08,01i need 9 monitors for bronystate
<Ragnano> NightHawk64: i think it's going to take a while
<BladedWings|HW> who is drawing?
<p4ngya> XxNightHawk64xX: that's a complete guess though btw
<Saturn> 08,011 for mane chat, 6 for siderooms, 1 for #bronystateregulars, 1 for stream
<infernap12> saturn: why 9!
<GilDash|NaNo> Saturn: Define "Monitor".
<infernap12> mkay
<Domo> xD
<StinkomanFan> Blueblood or Fancypants? I can't tell. :s
<Vivix> oh damn Saturn--I now imagine you sitting in a room surrounded by monitors in the dark
<Kammerjunk> I just need another monitor. Currently, I can play in one screen and do everything else in another, but that's not enough.
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: that is pretty much my life
<BladedWings|HW> oh its Domo ^_^ yay
<Vivix> You're never forced to respond to anything Kandarihu, sometimes sitting down and going "none of my business" is best solution
<p4ngya> bronystateregulars? whats that for
<Saturn> 08,01p4ngya: bronystate regulars.
<Kammerjunk> p4ngya: Exactly what it says on the tin.
<infernap12> my computer can only handle 4 monitors at anyone time though
<Kammerjunk> INB4 joins.
<XxNightHawk64xX> cause they already did the tournament and other than fluttershys character and music it seemed good enough for a multiplayer release which they said they would release even if the story mode isnt done yet
<Domo> BladedWings|Hw: >w< -hug-
<StinkomanFan> p4ngya, IT'S NOTHING
<StinkomanFan> NOTHING AT ALL
<p4ngya> but...why are bronystateregulars in bronystate D:
*BladedWings|HW hugs Domo back ^_^
<AttackWithHugs> I want two monitors when I build my computer
<p4ngya> *aren't
<GilDash|NaNo> I'd help 'monitor' but I'm going to be busy... with writing... possibly all day. -_-
<Kammerjunk> Called it.
<Saturn> 08,01AttackWithHugs: get 3
<StinkomanFan> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU
<Kandarihu> Vivix, you've never been forced to defend values that you care about when they were under attack, were you?
<AttackWithHugs> But I need some space for that, which I don't have at the moment
<Saturn> 08,01also, my god, i *love* mushrooms
<Vivix> Kandarihu I have, but why should i defend my points when they don't need it?
<StinkomanFan> Now all the new guys will try to get in!
<Jmo> I can't live without two monitors :<
<GilDash|NaNo> I want 3 monitors when I get my new PC. Finally getting the space for them as well. >: )
<StinkomanFan> And we won't be able to do squat about it!
<Kammerjunk> It's not a secret club.
<infernap12> some graphics cards only support 2 though! be careful
<AttackWithHugs> Saturn, I'm gonna need more space for 3 monitors. Right now I barely have walking space in my room when it's clean
<Coolu> all this talk about monitors
<Saturn> 08,01AttackWithHugs: at least your room is clean
<p4ngya> huh
<AttackWithHugs> Because it's smaller than the one when I first moved with my sister
<Coolu> i only have one
<Coolu> :(
<AttackWithHugs> Saturn: My room is most definitely not clean <3
<DerpyMuffins> Alright back
<RaveBrony> I only have 1 monitor, im looking to get another :)
<Ragnano> Coolu: same here
<Vivix> I only have one monitor too- but I only need one! Honest!
<Kammerjunk> Yup. People joining. Then leaving.
<BladedWings|HW> Coolu: its ok i have only one as well *hug*
<StinkomanFan> But we go here to get away from the idiots on movie nights. They'll come in here for it and screw it up!
<StinkomanFan> OH wait
<Ragnano> welcome back DerpyMuffins
<Kammerjunk> Most of them aren
<StinkomanFan> I don't even go here anymore
<BladedWings|HW> wb DerpyMuffins
<Unholycondolences> its a guy taking a shit!
<RainbowAsh> Hi DerpyMuffins
<Colt_Brovakiin> Welcome back DerpyMuffins :)
<Saturn> 08,01i moved back in with my parents because i couldn't afford accommodation while at uni, and while i was living else where, they converted my bedroom into a storeroom
<infernap12> seriously guys, dual displays is a must these days
<Kammerjunk> Most people aren't on this time of day IIRC.
<StinkomanFan> It's YOUR problem :)
<Saturn> 08,01they never converted it back once i moved back in
<Vivix> !
<Kammerjunk> Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.
<Saturn> 08,01and, of course, *i* can't move anythign, because it's all their stuff
<Wubstep> Back Sorry About That xP
<Kandarihu> I could use a few more monitors. One for IRC, one for web browsing, one for the obligatory video streams, one for Bronystate stream, and one for gaming.
<Vivix> I could use two, one for DAW one for note's and mixer
<Kammerjunk> My biggest problem is room. I don't have enough space on my wall for monitors.
<Vivix> but I don't need two
<AttackWithHugs> I could use 3 but 2 would be enough for me at the moment
<Jmo> lololol
<Kammerjunk> Most of my wall is covered by shelves.
<AttackWithHugs> One for IRC, another for stream/other things
<Jmo> people and using walls
<Vivix> I don't have monitors on my waaall oh god no
<infernap12> i dont have the money for a third
<Saturn> 08,01honestly, i've been using just 1 monitor for years now
<Kammerjunk> Jmo: If you saw my desk, you'd understand
<Saturn> 08,01i used to have 3 monitors
<Vivix> Linux window switch?
<Ragnano> once i have the cables i will set up my second monitor :)
<Saturn> 08,01but i've been using a laptop as my main computer for a while
<infernap12> eww
<infernap12> laptop
<infernap12> how do you game?
<Saturn> 08,01if i had a desk, i'd set up a second monitor
<Saturn> 08,01infernap12: i don't
<Saturn> 08,01even though it's a gaming laptop
<GilDash|NaNo> Yeah, I've been useing my laptop for about 3 years now. I don't even have a mouse.
<infernap12> gasp
<Saturn> 08,01i don't like computer games
<Vivix> Hehe
<J_E_Smith71> Man this guy playing pony music on piano at EQLA is awesome
<Vivix> I game, but not nearly as much as anyone else in ehre it seems
<Kammerjunk> Computer games are for people with spare time.
<Saturn> 08,01i bought a gaming laptop so that i could do GPGPU CUDA and OpenCL programing on it
<Vivix> That reminds me saturn
<Saturn> 08,01actually, there are a few games i've enjoyed recently
<Saturn> 08,01the portal series, and WoW
<Vivix> for 2d graphics--where the hell do you start? Direct2D?--OpenGL didn't seem to natively support it-?
<J_E_Smith71> And SuperBrony makes his first EQLA purchase: https://twitter.com/ConCrusaders/status/264766231469518848/photo/1/large
<Saturn> 08,01both of which my laptop runs quite happily
<Ragnano> i don't play WoW anymore
<Kammerjunk> Portal is a fun series.
<Ragnano> but portal is fun
<Kammerjunk> Especially the second Portal game,.
<Kammerjunk> I cried.
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: openGL has 2D stuff; but if you want to start really simple, try PyGame
<Vivix> Python? I've tried that a very long time ago- before properly learning-
<Saturn> 08,01it's a library for Python, and it's the only graphics library i've ever used that's actually *fun* to program in
<Vivix> I kinda want to try a C or C++ library-
<Vivix> ooh
<Kammerjunk> I hear Python is fairly fun.
<Vivix> I've heard good things about Python, and common lisp
<Kammerjunk> Been meaning to start learning it, but goddamn school.
<CrimsonPhoenix> this music
<CrimsonPhoenix> ....where is it from?
<p4ngya> CrimsonPhoenix: i second this inquiry
<Dismo> ;o; Sumica I got kicked from the RD channel?
<CrimsonPhoenix> SONIC RUSH
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: use opengl rather than directx
<CrimsonPhoenix> is it?
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: it's mre portable
<alexxm|foal> i thought this was from the rythom heaven gams
<Vivix> okay- I'll try to get the SDK and such- was kinda hard to navigate
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: http://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=2D_using_OpenGL
<Vivix> DirectX api was so full of Windows 8 and appstore that it was more confusing than helpful at first
<Vivix> Oh, thank you!
<Kammerjunk> I can't wait to not use Windows 8 ever.
<Jmo> Don't start with W8 hate.
<DerpyMuffins> Ahh
<Saturn> 08,01i feel more people will be switching over to Linux
<Saturn> 08,01try out Ubuntu; it's really nice
<Prince_Blueblood> W8 sucks
<Vivix> Steam is going linux now
<Kammerjunk> Jmo: Hey, not saying it's all bad.
<Prince_Blueblood> good thing I just recently upgraded to 7
<Jmo> I'm just saying.
<Vivix> I kinda hope W8 is just a sidestep for touch-stuff
<Jmo> So many people hate on it, it's hilarious.
<Saturn> 08,01if you dont like the new Ubuntu Unity interface, try Xubuntu, which uses the Xfce desktop environment
<Vivix> but W7 - I love it
<Ragnano> Vivix: i hope so
<Saturn> 08,01or Linux Mint with either Cinnamon or Mate
<DerpyMuffins> Linux will be taking over in a few decades
<Prince_Blueblood> that's because w8's ui is crap
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: I've used Ubuntu for a while now, been wondering if I should switch over to something else.
<Vivix> What about Kubuntu?
<Jmo> lol^
<Saturn> 08,01DerpyMuffins: not even in a few decades
<infernap12> so what do you need to code openGL for saturn?
<Prince_Blueblood> if I wanted a toy I'd have bought a mac
<Ragnano> i actually considered trying ubuntu
<Saturn> 08,01DerpyMuffins: i reckon that linux will be much much bigger on the desktop in the next 5 years
<Prince_Blueblood> but what else can you expect from wannabe jobs balmerware
<Saturn> 08,01infernap12: i don't know; i've never done it before
<DerpyMuffins> You think very highly of linux Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01look for an opengl sdk
<XxNightHawk64xX> SONIC RUSH MUSIC FTW
<infernap12> like whats your career/ career pathway?
<Saturn> 08,01DerpyMuffins: i do; it's not without its faults, though
<Kammerjunk> The only problem I have with Linux, being a gamer through and through, is the vast amount of distros.
<StinkomanFan> One of the Princesses then, considering the scepter.
<J_E_Smith71> Man wish I could have done EQLA. Disneyland across the street, the documentary premiere, SB being there. Just wish I had the cash for all that
<XxNightHawk64xX> OMG WHY DO I KEEP GETTING THAT RUSSIAN JUSTIN BIEBER AD
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: oh, that's easy; just use ubuntu :P
<Vivix> Distros can be confusing
<Vivix> I only remember the old ones-
<Vivix> but Ubuntu is said to be very simple for linux-noobs
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: I have been for a while on my laptop. Been wondering whether or not I should stick with it.
<Vivix> Last time we tried linux we tried Debian desktop I think- and we weren't able to access root or su
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: perosnally, i really dislike the Unity interface
<[Alpha]> oh crap I forgot I was still on here
<Saturn> 08,01so i've been using Xubuntu for ages
<DerpyMuffins> I tried Linux, but it got too confusing
<[Alpha]> Saturn: I'm using Ubuntu :P
<Kandarihu> I've generally preferred Kubuntu, to be honest. But my install on my old computer died a long time ago and I never felt like fixing it.
<Saturn> 08,01linux is just as simple to use as Windows nowadays
<CrimsonPhoenix> this accordeon makes me want to play Layton
<RainbowAsh> If Steam really goes ahead and makes a client for linux and gets most of my old games running there, I might as well switch, too.
<Vivix> I was a KDE fan back in linux days, so Kubuntu speaks to me
<Saturn> 08,01RainbowAsh: it's not a matter of if; they're releasing the beta later this month
<Vivix> but people told me not to get it because of Ram hog-
<Unholycondolences> GOOGLE: helps fix the worst time of hair issue ;)
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Wait, seriously? That's fantastic.
<ekips> Ubuntu was the first distro I was introduced to (at work) so I'm sticking with it for now
<Vivix> Yeah, Steam is releasing a client and L4D2 for Linux
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: aye; they've ported all their Source games, and a *lot* of developers are porting their games too
<DerpyMuffins> Trying new things Domo?
<Kammerjunk> I am excite.
<Ragnano> yay, i might as well switch to linux :P
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, they're finding they get better performance in Linux than Windows
<Vivix> I remember unreal torunament 2004 cane with linux installer
<Kammerjunk> No surprises there.
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: i think that was just for a dedicated server
<DerpyMuffins> I am too used to Windows to switch to linux
<Saturn> 08,01DerpyMuffins: no you're not
<Vivix> Really? I thought it was the game as well-
<CrimsonPhoenix> EILEMONTY DID A COVER OF THE MOON RISES
<CrimsonPhoenix> OADGFNJVODWSNFWVIWSANGFDVKIRDSFN B
<ekips> Saturn I think that performance depends on what distro is used
<Saturn> 08,01ekips: not... really
<Kammerjunk> CrimsonPhoenix: Wait, she did?
<Vivix> I think Linux is going to grow, but it'll probably be a bit of a nerd thing for quite a while
<socksfilly> <_<
<Saturn> 08,01honestly, there's no real difference between distros
<[Alpha]> http://i.imgur.com/LchdK.jpg mY desktop on Ubuntu
<DerpyMuffins> Unless you got advice for a noob linux user Saturn, Im sticking with windows
<Kammerjunk> [Alpha]: I approve this wallpaper.
<Saturn> 08,01imma move onto my laptop and show you my desktop
<Vivix> I MISS LINUX
<ekips> Saturn Oh, thanks for the enlightment ^^
<Vivix> But I have no spare computers!
<Jmo> inb4 flood of desktop screenshots
<Ragnano> i dunno which ubuntu version i should use if i switch to linux
<[Alpha]> Kammerjunk: Thank you :P

<ekips> DerpyMuffins what is your favourite browser?
<Kammerjunk> DerpyMuffins: Probably can. What is it?
<[Alpha]> Ffirefox or chrome?
<DerpyMuffins> Maxthon3
<J_E_Smith71> And of course Everfree has their video stream (Listen to a MLP piano medley): http://www.everfree.net/eqla/
<Unholycondolences> Firefox
<pot80_GLaDos> thanks Colt_Brovakiin sorry I couldent find your comment :P
<[Alpha]> it's built into ubuntu
<Ragnano> DerpyMuffins: Firefox is imo the best browser
<Colt_Brovakiin> its ok :P
<Kandarihu> DerpyMuffins, Firefox is available for Ubuntu. Not sure if it's default for it though.
<[Alpha]> Yes it's default
<ekips> Firefox is the default browser for Ubuntu
*AJIsAwesome hugs Ragnano :)
<DerpyMuffins> Sorry I just prefer Maxthon as my browser
*DoctoDoctorWho is listening to ACDC "Back In Black" currently
<J_E_Smith71> Don't know what's up with their chat box, but I'm paying attention to this one anyways
<Kandarihu> I used Kubuntu, and the default browser is Konqueror, which is stil nicer than IE.
<[Alpha]> I have both chrome and firefox just in case though
*Ragnano hugs AJIsAwesome back
<DoctoDoctorWho> Words are incapable of describing the awesome:)
<Ragnano> [Alpha]: same here
<Kammerjunk> DerpyMuffins: There isn't a Maxthon 3 version for Ubuntu AFAIK. Don't think Maxthon 3 works very well with Wine, either.
<DerpyMuffins> Can I even swtich browsers with ubantu? If I can then I will switch
<Ragnano> Kammerjunk: i don't like maxthon 3
<ekips> I have Firefox and Firefox Portable on an USB stick, just in case :3
<Kammerjunk> Ragnano: No, but DerpyMuffins does.
<[Alpha]> I also have both windows and lunix on my computer. when it loads up it gives me a choice of which one I want to use.
<Vivix> Of course you can switch browser on Ubuntu
<Jmo> Vivix I will eat your computer.
<Vivix> I DARE YOU
<Jmo> OH IT'S ON.
<Vivix> IT'S SO FULL OF CATPISS YOU'LL DIE
<Kammerjunk> wat
<[Alpha]> ???
<Jmo> .....wat
<DerpyMuffins> Ubantu is faster right?
<DerpyMuffins> In performence
<Unholycondolences> Pinkie Pie O.o
<ekips> what..just happened?
<GilDash|Relocating> This is an interesting conversation to walk back into.
<Vivix> All u's darling
<Vivix> Ubuntu
<Vivix> I think it's a little bit faster
<Jmo> LOLOL
<AJIsAwesome> Agreed, GilDash. :D
<Jmo> Vivix just trails off like it never happened.
<Vivix> WELL
<Vivix> It was just a catpee joke ;__;
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: El shitbox?
<DerpyMuffins> Which is faster?
<[Alpha]> I have luna as my theme on chrome and Octavia as my theme on firefoc
<Vivix> Oh noo, it is a crazy computer
<[Alpha]> firefox
<Vivix> Which if faster between what?
<DerpyMuffins> OS
<[Alpha]> let me test
<Ragnano> [Alpha]: luna is best princess :P
<Vivix> Well Linux is usually faster than windows
<Vivix> but neither is slow
<Vivix> Saturn knows all that muuch better than I
<GilDash> I don't think this laptop likes working much anymore... it keeps acting like its crashed once on desktop, but is just loading without response. -_-
<DerpyMuffins> Time to start transfering files
<Ragnano> Vivix: not if you don't have aslow pc
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im using an 11 year old dell laptop right now, why me:'(
<Kammerjunk> Well, I'm planning on doing a complete wipe of my system soon, so I might as well install Ubuntu as a partition.
<Vivix> Maybe not, I dunno
<Vivix> I want linux again too, I dunno I just miss it- and now that I dabble in programming, it would be fun to customize it like hell
<GilDash> Well, if it's a call of whether to update to Windows 8 or go to Linux, I'll be heading the Linux way.
<StinkomanFan> Is this Celestia or Luna? She's got the Black motif of Luna but the Flames of Celestia
<Vivix> but- none of my music or animation software work in Linux
<StinkomanFan> They do a fusion dance or something while I wasn't looking?
<Kammerjunk> GilDash: Hah, no. Windows 7 will probably become the new Windows XP.
<Vivix> Probably indeed
<[Alpha]> Just have them both like I do
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: Running Win7 now. Won't be leaving it for 8.
<Ragnano> StinkomanFan: i think it is neither
<DerpyMuffins> Guess Im switching to linux
<Ragnano> GilDash: Same here
<DerpyMuffins> Any advice for first time users?
<Vivix> I might create a partition or buy a hdd for linux and do a double start-
<XxNightHawk64xX> who is he drawing
<Kammerjunk> DerpyMuffins: You'll probably want to start with Ubuntu.
<ekips> I'm on Windows 8 right now to test it for a month. Will probably switch back to 7 though >.>
<otakon> no idea
<DoctoDoctorWho> StinkomanFan: Celunstia? The Super stallion of legend?
<Jmo> why ekips?
<infernap12> the only reason id switch to 8 would be for the gigantic performance increases
<otakon> DoctoDoctorWho: lol
<Kammerjunk> DoctoDoctorWho: Sumerpan?
<StinkomanFan> CELUNSTIA, GODDESS OF ALL
<GilDash> I think of it like this: Win7 = XP. Win8 = Vista.
<pot80_GLaDos> Stallion? Godess? make up your minds
<Kammerjunk> GilDash: That sounds accurate.
<Ragnano> GilDash: every 2nd windows is a fail :P
<ekips> Jmo The new things do not appeal to me, like the charm bar
<DoctoDoctorWho> It is a possibility, Im just saiyan.
<GilDash> This laptop used to have Vista on it... *shudder*
<Jmo> Right.
<Jmo> Apperance is everything it seems.
<GilDash> I dunno... 95 > 98 seemed to be okay.
<ekips> The charm bar is just not handy enough
<RDLovesPi> ooh software upgradde
<Ragnano> GilDash: i don't mean the old ones
<ekips> my meal is ready, seeya for Euro Night!
<[Alpha]> yeah google chrom is faster on ubuntu
<Ragnano> ekips: bai
<GilDash> Ragnano: Where do you draw the line though? It's only just begun trending with Vista...
<Ragnano> brb, helping my brother
<GilDash> Possibly Win2000.
<Roseluck`> this song is win
<Vivix> Chrome was slower on all canvas related things to me
<DerpyMuffins> Can you even download Maxthon on ubuntu?
<Vivix> even Ie9 was faster-
<DoctoDoctorWho> Roseluck`: what is it?
<Roseluck`> isnt this in madoka magica?
<J_E_Smith71> Well the piano medley is over. EQLA's opening ceremony is coming up
<GilDash> Wow. IE9 faster then Chrome. O_o
<Kandarihu> Roseluck`, yes. It's the ED theme, Magia
<RDLovesPi> IE9?
<Roseluck`> damn right :D
<Jmo> .-.
<Kammerjunk> Jmo: No, but I am and will always be a gamer through and through. Both Blizzard and VALVe consider Windows 8 an absolute catastrophe (which is why VALVe is bringing Steam to Linux).
<Ragnano> back
<Kelpow> IE internet explorer
<GilDash> There's plenty who think Win8 is a catastrophe in gaming terms.
<Vivix> IE9 was faster than chrome on Canvas related things
<GilDash> I'm certainly one of them.
<Kandarihu> So NOW I remember why I found the name Kalafina and their style so familiar!
<DoctoDoctorWho> Roseluck`: stream hates me so I guess Ill just have to be content with listening to ACDC Back in black
<Jmo> lolol
<RDLovesPi> my friend downloaded the windows 8 demp, and he says it runs terrible
<Jmo> Please, tell me what is wrong with W8 in gaming terms.
<Kammerjunk> GilDash: Ditto.
<Kelpow> win8 isa terrible desicion
<Vivix> Guuyyysss
<Kammerjunk> Jmo: Closed system.
<Kelpow> yup
<StinkomanFan> Celunstia... what happens if she does the fusion dance with ChrystaliCadence
<J_E_Smith71> SuperBrony runs into Mr.MOV himself: https://twitter.com/ConCrusaders/status/264772428402655234/photo/1/large
<GilDash> Which is a shame, because I'm soon to become a PC gamer again and Win8 is the first thing that would hit me. -_-
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: yeeeeeesss?
<Jmo> So that's the only reason you're gonna lay on me?
<Jmo> Pffft
<Ragnano> Kammerjunk: that's why i don't like apple
<Vivix> Staaap iiit
<infernap12> I HATE the closed system design
<Vivix> I don't mind closed systems
<infernap12> it always gets in your way
<Vivix> it --kinda depends
<Kandarihu> I wonder if all the new prebuilts hitting the market are all going to be running Windows 8
<infernap12> i feel clostrophobic
<RDLovesPi> hey anypony here know e nomine?
<StinkomanFan> Wait... that's not a scepter
<infernap12> and trapped
<Kammerjunk> Jmo: It's why I don't like it. I'm not telling you what to do, I'm saying why I don't feel it's good for a gamer.
<GilDash> Closed system, resource hog, stupid user interface, designed for tablets not PCs, no start menu, Windows store, etc.
<StinkomanFan> IT'S A TORCH :O
<Jmo> 'resource hog' false.
<Vivix> It has a start menu though, I think
<DerpyMuffins> Omg, downloading ubuntu on my desktop is gonna take forever
<Jmo> 'stupid UI' false
<MadSurge> I'm back guys! Domo art stream? :O
<Jmo> no start menu, false.
<Kelpow> WB!
<RDLovesPi> it's a fire wand, silly
<Jmo> Windows store is optional.
<Ragnano> MadSurge: wb, and yes
<Domo> MadSurge: Welcome back~ and yep :3
<Kelpow> there is a start menu, its ust harder to find and works terrible
<infernap12> def no resource hog, lightest, fastest OS yet
<DoctoDoctorWho> StinkomanFan: Chryluntadencia, boo-yah.
<RDLovesPi> lol i see my comments
<Jmo> 'Harder to find and works terrible' False.
<GilDash> Depends on your version. It's worse then Win7 for resources used, it's got a stupid UI unless you get the full version, no start menu unless full version, only Windows store unless full version.
<Kelpow> true
<Kelpow> this charms crap is rediculous
<Vivix> full version is cheap though
<Jmo> lolol
<MadSurge> Domo: dat Madoka Magica ending theme <3
<DerpyMuffins> Can you change your orb for ununtu?
<GilDash> It's cheap because MS know it's shite.
<Kandarihu> Newegg is carrying 64 models of Desktop PCs with Windows 8
<Vivix> It's cheap because they want to sell many
<StinkomanFan> Chryluntadencia. Would she still be a princess or a Queen at that point?
<Domo> MadSurge: Yes <33 Kalafina is awesome
<RDLovesPi> if(windows8_is_good == true) {CW("What?"); }
<GilDash> They're competing with Apple and the smartphone industry. They don't give a crap about the PC marketplace at the moment; it's shrinking anyway.
<Kelpow> win8 is especialy terrible if your a user from a previous windows, and youll just get confused
<Jmo> Lol.
<Jmo> Whatever floats your boat.
<DoctoDoctorWho> StinkomanFan: Chryluntadencia, God Empress of the imperium of ponykind
<Ragnano> i think for a pc beginner win8 is just fine
<Vivix> Pc market isn't shrinking
<GilDash> Sales are decreasing.
<RDLovesPi> and for someone whose advanced at pc?
<Kelpow> for someone whos new, they wont know that everything else is better
<GilDash> HP and plenty of other manufacturers are struggling to sell. Their profits are losses.
<Kelpow> but for a previous user, its crap
<The_Engineer> Hi everybody :)
<StinkomanFan> Chryluntadencia... AKA Fausticorn
<MadSurge> Yo GilDash :3
<Vivix> well who the fuck buys prebuilt computers?
<Kelpow> hi
<GilDash> A lot of people.
<Vivix> not pc nerds
<Ragnano> hey The_Engineer
<GilDash> Small minority.
<StinkomanFan> NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERDS
<Vivix> sales are fine, and offices still prefer computers over any other crap
<GilDash> If sales are fine why are losses beign recorded?
<RDLovesPi> i made the computer for my dad, and it works better than pre-builds
<Vivix> How the hell should I know
<RDLovesPi> custom is best
<GilDash> Cause sales aren't fine, obviously.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, The_Engineer and MadSurge. :)
<Vivix> obviously I fucked up
<Kelpow> custom is pretty solid
<Vivix> I don't think there's a problem
<J_E_Smith71> EQLA's opening ceremony has started. Now it really begins
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome! :$
<RDLovesPi> btw anypony know how to build a Commodore 128?
<Kelpow> nope
<Ragnano> a what?
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: I'm nitpicking like there's no tomorrow here, but of course they're using computers, silly.
<Vivix> Noone in office environment would prefer to work on a touch-screen, I would rather work on a typewriter
<GilDash> Smartphones are the new PCs. MS know that and are tryign to jump onto the bandwagon. Problem is Win8 is going to suffer as a result of their desire to make it cross-platform.
<pony_3699> i cant see whats the link for the livestream
<RDLovesPi> a type of computer
<Vivix> smartphones aren't the new pc's they're the new gadget
<Jmo> Are you serious?
<pot80_GLaDos> well I finally got the chat to work on that LA convension stream BYE!
<Vivix> they're for social shit and taking pictures
<Jmo> Smartphones are the new PCs?
<Kelpow> smartphones will neverbe able to match up to pc's
<RDLovesPi> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128
<Jmo> You're making my brain cells commit suicide GilDash.
<Roseluck`> meow
<GilDash> I'm talking market, not actual tech.
<pony_3699> WHATS THE LINK FOR THE LIVESTREAM
<Vivix> Computers aren't made for gaming and surfing, that's why they're not tailoring to it
<Kelpow> because the more they can put into a smart phone, they can fit EVEN MORE into a PC
<pot80_GLaDos> pony_3699: what the LA thing?
<[Alpha]> I wanna test the canvas on chrome. P.m a link
<GilDash> Again, market, not tech.
<Ragnano> BUT you can even run ubuntu on smartphones, with monitor and everything
<[Alpha]> Oh yeah I heard about that
<Vivix> Don't have a link to chrome, I did have a link to a line-draw loop though
<Kelpow> cpomputers ARE made for surfing and gamin
<GilDash> Financial market. Not technology. Big difference.
<Vivix> not FOR
<[Alpha]> No I already have chrome
<RDLovesPi> what'ss ubuntu again?
<[Alpha]> lunix
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bonnie Zacherle > Lauren faust > Chryluntadencia
<Vivix> I mean canvas* not chrome
<pony_3699> whaere is the livestream vid???!!!
<RDLovesPi> [Alpha]: lol lunix
<[Alpha]> They ported ubuntu on the nexus 7 tablet
<StinkomanFan> Who's Bonnie Zacherle? The chick who founded the series I take it?
<Dismo> Euro movie night starts at 1:59 PM? :I
<[Alpha]> RDLovesPi: Cool story bro
<[Alpha]> Domo: I'm digging this music
<pot80_GLaDos> pony_3699: which one the one on the left or the LA convension one? :P
<pot80_GLaDos> hurrp derp
<Domo> >w< Glad you like!
<Kelpow> dismo, its gunna be 10 59 here
<Dismo> [Alpha]: "Cool story Bro" ....Just...No.
<pony_3699> the actual livestream vid i cant see it
<DerpyMuffins> Good choice of music Domo
<DoctoDoctorWho> StinkomanFan: Bonnie Zacherle, Rockin the world with ponies since 1983
<Vivix> http://jsperf.com/fillorpath here's a canvas speed test
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/7OgEA.jpg
<RaveBrony> Hah
<[Alpha]> I don't mind thaht I am not approved by your standards but I do as I please thank you
<[Alpha]> that
<Dismo> Silly Shizu
<RDLovesPi> hey what theatre is the movie night in?
<Kelpow> like yo style alpha
<pot80_GLaDos> pony_3699: so the one on this page then... well thats on this page?
<Kelpow> the movie is in all theaters
<pony_3699> just the chat but no video
<RDLovesPi> okay thanks
<Kandarihu> Captain's Log is best log
<BladedWings|HW> lol Shizuka
<infernap12> why have multiple theatres if all the same?
<Roseluck`> oh god shizukas here, hide your misbehavior!
<AJIsAwesome> pony_3699: YOu probably need to update your flash player.
<AJIsAwesome> *You
<diddutz> pony_2608: Spike has no vid
<pony_3699> how?
<Kelpow> yeah, all theaters share the same stream, its just to help control chat
<Vivix> chat goes crazy bananas when there's a lot of people
<AJIsAwesome> ^ :D
<StinkomanFan> infernap12 because we can't hold all these guys in one big room
<DoctoDoctorWho> infernap12: when chat starts overflowing
<[Alpha]> Kelpow: Thank you :)
<GilDash> Vivix: You mean like it will on Nov 10th? XD
<Vivix> oh hay yeah
<AJIsAwesome> pony_3699: Do you have Adobe FLash Player?
<Kelpow> noproblem
<pot80_GLaDos> LOL so anyways bye :P
<J_E_Smith71> infernap12: Mainly for new episodes. Next week its going to be chaos with over thousands of people. So the side rooms are there for handling giant crowds
<Vivix> I won't be on chat then, but it will be crazy
<DerpyMuffins> The mods will only open side chat rooms on the 10th
<DerpyMuffins> The main will be closed most likely
<pony_3699> i should have it
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: Will the chat reactions be recorded? :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> We will have all 6 PACKED on the 10th
<pony_3699> but my youtube isnt working eaither
<GilDash> I won't be on on 10th. I'm away, so I might miss the 1st S3 episode. :(
<AJIsAwesome> DoctoDoctorWho: Everyone will go to all the chats except AJ's. :D
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/39fad0d97e68105c1dc83ebc11780686.png :3
<DerpyMuffins> Im going out with my GF on the 10th
<Ragnano> DoctoDoctorWho: of course they will
<[Alpha]> I'm going on Aj.
<DerpyMuffins> So I wont be here either
<[Alpha]> Because of that
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: Sure, TroIIestia and swainize should be back to do that
<Ragnano> yay higurashi!
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: Okay. Thanks! :)
<Kelpow> derpy, tell her ponys are more important
<Domo> I should have played this song on Halloween >w>;
*Ragnano sings along
<infernap12> i bet most will just go to Rainbow Dash
<AJIsAwesome> They ususally do. :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> It'll be like, the super bowl, world cup, major leage, the olympics, and every other major sports event in history, COMBINED.
<pony_3261> i can't see anything
<DerpyMuffins> I'd like to keep my GF Kelpow
<Ragnano> DoctoDoctorWho: rrright!
<otakon> crap has anyone else's stream gone dead?
<[Alpha]> The stream makes me wish I can draw :/
<J_E_Smith71> Super's singing along with Smile Smile Smile right now
<diddutz> DoctoDoctorWho: biggest Event in all of time and space ^^
<Ragnano> pony_3261: i think you should update your flash player
<DerpyMuffins> Blowing off a date to watch ponies isnt the gentlemans way
<MadSurge> GilDash: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/d49b9eeb4ca1c526c5b1afd59997a447.png here's an RD for you, so you won't feel alone next saturday :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> urgh......
<otakon> there it goes
<otakon> DerpyMuffins: better idea, watch ponies WITH your date
<Kelpow> DerpyMuffins: then bring her with you! ponys are calling you!
<Kelpow> exactly
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, who's the artist?
<GilDash> MadSurge: I shall print her out and take her with me. XD
<Vivix> I would blow off a date for ponies- jeez what is wrong with me
<DerpyMuffins> My GF doesnt exactly like ponies
<Ragnano> Vivix: nothing
<Kelpow> is strream broken?
<DerpyMuffins> She doesnt hate it, just not intrested
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: So he's on the stage?
<Ragnano> Kelpow: it seems so
*Vivix is totally fine
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: it's right there next to RD's hoof, Sauriv
<Kelpow> WHAT? SHES NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU
<DoctoDoctorWho> I am doomed to live without romance in my life...
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: No but in the crowd of course
<[Alpha]> http://glancojusticar.deviantart.com/art/YOU-RE-DOING-IT-WRONG-331900602
<AJIsAwesome> .
<AJIsAwesome> *Oh
<CrimsonPhoenix> subtle signature watermark as well
<CrimsonPhoenix> in any case that's a very nice style
<DerpyMuffins> I cant exactly ask my GF to change for my sake
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im already engaged to my work
<J_E_Smith71> Oh wait that's Rina-Chan dressed as Luna there
<CrimsonPhoenix> maybe the pose could use a little work
<Kelpow> who here hasnt seen the bornys react to: teens react to: my litle pony?
<CrimsonPhoenix> J_E_Smith71, of course it is she's the head of EQLA
<CrimsonPhoenix> she is**
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: Well, I DID NOT see that coming.
<[Alpha]> I'm going to watch that now
<DoctoDoctorWho> Kelpow: bro, HOOF!!
<otakon> my stream keeps dying :(
<thisguy> dem buffers :\
<J_E_Smith71> CrimsonPhoenix: Didn't know that was her till they called her by name
<CrimsonPhoenix> You guys didn't know Rina-Chan planned EQLA?
<Ragnano> otakon: same here :/
<Kandarihu> Invisible buffer circle!
<CrimsonPhoenix> I knew it from the start
<DerpyMuffins> I knew CrimsonPhoenix
<CrimsonPhoenix> her voice doesn't change
<otakon> DAMN YOU BUFFER CIRCLE!
<otakon> DAMN YOU!

<CrimsonPhoenix> and she did a horrible impersonation of Luna
<GilDash> I can't even see the Buffer Circle. It's transparent-white on white.
<Kelpow> DctoDoctorWho (\ brohof!

<Fl00t4sh41> Dken2021: You can usually find HD uploads on youtubes within a day anyhow. But being there is preferable I suppose
<Dken2021> Fl00t4sh41 yea, there's always that, but I like watching it with you guys
<CrimsonPhoenix> wait....the voice and writers have two panels?
<CrimsonPhoenix> EQLA is so small....
<Kelpow> dDken2021 you sure you wanna hear it?
<Dken2021> hear what?
<Kelpow> the joke
<StinkomanFan> So... why does she have a Coca Cola dress on?
<Fl00t4sh41> Dken2021: The only episode I've seen live is the season 2 finale. The rest where before I came here
<AJIsAwesome> Why doesn't she? :3
<Kelpow> this stream is so broken
<Dken2021> Kelpow sure I guess
<Ragnano> i wish i could go to ANY brony conventions, but 14 years old + living in germany = no suck thing
<Ragnano> *such
<Kelpow> Dken2021 whats the difrence between a jew and a pizza?
<Kelpow> i warned you -.-

<AJIsAwesome> *Pizzas
<Alchemist> ouch
<Roseluck`> i dont get it, Kelpow

<Saturn> 08,01one thing we used to do in Physics to mess with people's heads, was to find the car of a professor or student that was parked on a driveway (without any other cars beside it), and push down and pull up on the back, in time with the oscillating frequency of the suspension
<otakon> which would do what?
<Saturn> 08,01this would set up an active damped SHM system, and eventually the car's back wheels would lift off the road
<Saturn> 08,01on the apex of this lift, we'd turn the car slightly
<Saturn> 08,01we'd keep doing this until the car was 90 degrees to its original posisiton
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<MadSurge> Saturn: Oh u :D

<Buytoast> With the money, utilize the aspects of the Playstation 3 to buy additioal content for your game for the small price of 59.99 American U.S. dollars.
<SnipsandSnails> Who ever invented newborn cuties must have been a Satan worshiper...
<DoctoDoctorWho> Nittany_Discord: infact, she actually made the stuff b4 g1

<Deacon> Shizuka ah, but can we see why kids love the satisfying taste of cinnamon toast crunch?
<[Alpha]> :P
<Shizuka> 13because it's satisfying?
<[Alpha]> No because they taste like awesome
<Buytoast> It's because that goddamn baker guy on the front of the box puts LSD or something into the stuff.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No. It's because of the cinnamon and sugar poured into every bite.
<DoctoDoctorWho> SnipsandSnails: wrong, even satan frowns upon their disreputable actions
<Buytoast> You can see it in his smug little face.
<Vivix> If you pour milk, cinnamon and sugar into a bolw and shake it, WHAT DO YOU GET?

*Socks bleeds and collapses
<SirGanjalf> DaringDerpy: Yeah, we sell them on black market instead
<Kimori> Thats partly true

<Kandarihu> DaringDerpy, well I've been around for about half a year, and I don't recognize soulero.
*Allie screams ANYTHING FROM THE PONY?! ANYYTHING FROM THE PONY?
<AJIsAwesome> ???

<Jmo> why Allie :<
*Nittany_Discord 11,01cleans BroHoof
<PONY> doesn't jury consists of random citizens?
<TKist> NOOO
<Lil_B> Deacon that's a Stepledder...
<Polydunami> Yeah, these are random people debating.
<RosePetal> Maybe they are random citizens.
<Kimori> k
<Polydunami> They're complete strangers.
<J_E_Smith71> MA Larson's fav pony to write for is Rarity
<Vash> his lawyer didn't think he stood a chance? who gave up essentially? Why wasn't he switched out?
<thelonepony> Allie: You will never kill me!!!!! hahahahaha
<PONY> Over analyzing <3
*BroHoof glomps Nittany_Discord
<RosePetal> All the ponies is best ponies.
<Allie> :O

<Deacon> So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Lil_B!
*Allie writes in thelonepony
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs BroHoof
<Vash> Man this court is all kinds of messed up
*Allie watches thelonepony die
<thelonepony> thats not my really name Kira :D
<J_E_Smith71> Amy's favorite pony is Pinkie (Considering she gave her so many good moments it shows)
<Vash> thelonelypony comes back as a zombie
<Allie> pff.
<alexxm|foal> we need to go deeper
<CriticKitten> We have to go DEEPER
<RosePetal> We have to go even Deeper.
<Blako> I wonder what is the best programming language to start with. C is pretty simple and straightforward, but Java has easier memory management and more pre-made stuff.
<Allie> im speaking about the lonely pony OUTSIDE
<MadSurge> Ooh, this guy is a foreigner
<Lil_B> Deacon I just judged it by the fact that it has Steps... normal ladders only have ledds and these ladfders have some serious step in there ladders
<thelonepony> Vash: whose is this thelonelypony you speak of :P
<Polydunami> I believe this man is from Czechoslovakia.

<BroHoof> ikr i don't believe that guy such a weird username
<thelonepony> explosions*
<cachi01> all this theories hurt my head >w<
<CriticKitten> I like how the cast is pretty diverse, and you're getting a good sense of each one's character just based on what they say.
<RosePetal> But names are supposed to be odd.
*thelonepony gives cachi01 some pillz
<cachi01> PEELZ
<AJIsAwesome> Agreed, CriticKitten.

<Kimori> In that case its Ham for us in english
<TKist> handy man
<CriticKitten> That seems a bit more circumstantial.
<petard> 3dry-cured ham that is usually thinly sliced and served uncooked
<RosePetal> Your getting your fingerprints all over the murder weapon!
<Alchemist> inacceptable!
<Kandarihu> I also remember having to watch this in school
<MadSurge> This is getting really interesting
<Amu-chan> Depends, prosciutto is a different kind than just regular ham.
<RosePetal> Wut?
<SirGanjalf|Angry> you hwhat?
<Polydunami> That's not the actual weapon, RosePetal. It's just another knife.
<Kimori> Yeah, was going to say its not the same ham we are probably not use to in the west
<RosePetal> Oh.
<DerpStar> Thats not how they thought me to take out sentries in the army
<Panda> Why was there a user named "boner" here? -__-
<Jmo> Ahahahaha
<Jmo> Good question Pondoo.
<kinixys> This is a pretty good movie.
<Kotano> nerf_soldier : What did your class think of the movie? I can imagine an eight-grader might not necessarily appreciate a movie like this...
<Polydunami> You think?
<RosePetal> Now, he's angry.
<Amu-chan> I'm part Italian, so I'm very aware of it.
<AJIsAwesome> Panda: I have no idea. -_-
<SpeccyRush> you tell
<Lil_B|Judge> hi Panda !
<Panda> Hi.
<Alchemist> Panda: his name was originally "Flacid", but he got excited.

<SirGanjalf|Angry> Guy in Fedora gives total amout of 0 fucks about this trial
<TKist> we dooont care
<RosePetal> That guy is sleeping.
<MisterSkids> lol
<kinixys> I detect bias.
<StinkomanFan> GTG, my father's being an asshole

<FlutterMEDIC> hi guys, back from the movie
<Megalomanic> They've had enough of your shit #10!
<Kandarihu> It's a Klingon discommendation ritual. All that's missing is for them to cross their arms in front of their chests.
<SpeccyRush> its about the caste
<CriticKitten> ....they're giving him the cold shoulder? XD
<Conyst> hello FlutterMEDIC
<SirGanjalf|Angry> I think this scene is about prejudice in general.
<cachi01> PONY: YOU WILL NEVER CATCH ME HAHAHAHAHA
<J_E_Smith71> They just gave Larson some cider and an AJ "Drink Cider, Be Responisble" shirt
<twilight_sprinkle> did they specify his race?
<Metronome> He's Classist <- Not sure this word exist
<Polydunami> And the one man who is logical listens.
<DerpStar> And it was discovered 20 years later that the kid was guilty... :p
<RosePetal> Notice how he's not yelling.
<MisterSkids> cant believe bronystate and Celsetia Radio are getting together
<Alchemist> its only ironic that its the 50s USA.
<SirGanjalf|Angry> oh, snap!
<Kandarihu> Juror 3: you no longer have a family or a name.

<CriticKitten> AttackWithHugs: A movie in which pirahnas grow to enourmous sizes and leap into buildings and attack helicopters.
<RosePetal> Whut is this man's obessesion with gulls?
<FlaschenJoe11> Invi: Why grab things, if you can Slash them
<AttackWithHugs> CriticKitten, oh lord.

<RosePetal> Feet?
<smrtgy1> This reminds me of the Bat Shark Repellant contained in the Bat Copter
<FlaschenJoe11> Invi: Gigan has a saw in his stomach. Your Argument is invalid
<CriticKitten> A dinosaur.
<RosePetal> Dat giant tooth.
<SpeccyRush> Vordox: Sweet Sweet Cheezus
<Invi> FlareChaser, but destoroyah has a laser in his stomach
<RosePetal> Even she is questioning this logic.
<Vordox> MEGALODON!
<Vordox> OMG
<CriticKitten> Uh, that tooth on the computer looks nothing like the tooth she removed from the wound.
<Vordox> THAT HORRIBLE CREATURE! I do NOT want to see it again!

<MadSurge> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Megalodon_tooth_great_white_shark_teeth_.jpg real Megalodon tooth with modern shark teeth
<FlaschenJoe11> Invi: Destoroyah is stronger since it's the mutated form of the very weapon which killed the first godzilla. So it's in a whole other level of power.
<smrtgy1> CriticKitten, that DOCTOR Professor Idiot
<RosePetal> Another plane, let's hope the shark doesnt eat the plane.
