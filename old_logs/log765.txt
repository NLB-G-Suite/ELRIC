<Whiskra> 12 hours until new pony episode!
<stallion1> dose
<OohShiny> Deadpool/10
<Kandarihu> If this works, I could honestly request Macross Zero, and we'd be fine having 2 and a half hours of high calibur prototype Valkyrie action, and we'd have credits 5 times through the deal.
<twilight_sprinkle> also so many claws in that half
<Stellafera> Guys it's not done
<Derpy> I give it a -:D/10
<Infectedflower> well atleast mlp is next

<Ninjazz> This is two movies? Are we going to watch the credits roll twice?
<DinkyDoo> Is it pony time?
<TrixieMuffins> 6/10 and pointy things
<stallion1> naw
<Skandranon> 42/10 cause of deadpool
<Kammerjunk> I'll just go to sleep after the next part if it has Deadpool, and earlier if it doesn't.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, in the recent Avengers vs. X-Men, I believe Hulk actually did the Fastball special with Wolvie
<Funfunfun> Hi!
<Saturn> 08,01sonicdude558: what text?
<FoddmasterZim> deadpool won
<pony_300> come to think of it, maybe we should've done vs Thor first, since this is perhaps the better of the two movies... deadpool, blood, and all
<infernap12> hulk cant lose, the down side, he has no friend foe recognition
<darken420> 7/7 ASSES

<Deadlypon3> SERIOUSLY! YOU BROUGHT THE HULK IN, NOTHING ENDS WELL WITH HIM
<LunaRoyalGuard> true dat Ghosties
<SaxyPretender> 0,14there's Greek as well
<OJ> "Loki, can I go to the bathroom?"

<Ross_Pit_shark_hunte> Banner!
<Derpy> RAINBOW DASH SIT DOWN and I agree with Ghosties :P
<Dovah> K thanks
<Infectedflower> Oh he's pisseed
<Funfunfun> Abd OW!
<SpirittHooves> ded
<otakon> Kurra: as long as The Hulk doesn't get blown to atoms or decapitated he can regenerate nearly any injury. He regenerated ALL OF HIS SKIN after it was burned off in a few moments
<Stellafera> You are already in Asgard, this won't change anything
<Sumica> 00,10why dose every one insist in meleeing the hulk
<r-dash> sup kyo
<magmablock> So Hulk destroys Thor, then what, Loki?
<Ghosties> 04Loki's not Greek though, so I'm not sure who is Greek mythology
<KyoKusagani1999> Nothing Much.
<ShatteringAmbiance> how is thor not dead
<ZeroPwny> Bruce Banner is screwed. Loki is screwed. His bitch is screwed. They're all screwed.
<stallion1> soo much anger
<otakon> Sumica: bc Ranged is just ping ping
<Infectedflower> ow
<Deadlypon3> Loki isn't really a forward thinger is he?
<Infectedflower> ow
<KyoKusagani1999> Dropped in for some MARVEL Action.
<Infectedflower> ow
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Brute force is best force?
<Darken420> isnt there greek and egyptian myth in this aswell?
<Ninjazz> Sumica, that arrogance against Humanity probably.
<Cajun> Didn't they do Hercules?
<Ryunosuke> suddenly cave
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: IIRC he technically picked up Thor while he was wielding it, no?
<Infectedflower> OW
<valoreins|Drawing> i know Hawkete won't Sumica
<SpirittHooves> sumica marvel logic
<ZeroPwny> Loki is Norse mythology
<KyoKusagani1999> Now, let's see some Capcom, and I'll be perfect!
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Probably because getting away from the giant bugger is nigh impossible.
<ShatteringAmbiance> so true Zero
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Heracles is an Avenger

<Madfish> All the hulk punches make them stupid
<Infectedflower> Yay
<Zamer> Rookedling Hulk is a seperate being inside Bruce, who is the literal emobodiment of anger. There have been few times when Banner and Bruce have been split, but they pretty much need to be one if they both wish to live
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Ghosties: yeah he's norse myth i think
<otakon> Sumica: plus the hammer has been knocked several miles away and Thor's hand is broken
