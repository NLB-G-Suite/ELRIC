<Andres> I go to download, which does not download, but redirects me to registering D:
<sally> i dunno
<sally> i'm not a tech person
<Andres> Then I try to register, which tells me that it failed to do so and tells me to download the client and register through that instead, which continues to the same loop.

<hawkie> 07Hm
<hawkie> 07Well
<hawkie> 07"Birth of Venus" <-
<hawkie> 07this one, I'm slightly familiar with
<Xeeshu> Andres is an Artist ?
<sally> oooo aaaaah

<hawkie> 07Oh meep
<hawkie> 07I should change that xvx
<WereMay> 14you didn't notice?
<WereMay> 14LOL
<Hawkie> 07thanks for letting me know
<Hawkie> 07No LOL
<Kipi> Uhh... Giotto, I think. 1400s... One important fact would be that although many artists were interested in Greek/Roman relgious characters, they were devout Christians themselves
<WereMay> 14eh, no problem :3
<WereMay> 14hmm Kipi?
<Kipi> Oh and it was made in freso/Italian Renaissance style
<WereMay> 14the Renaissance, lots of art depicting Greek/Roman myths and legends
<WereMay> 14yes
<Andres> http://andresindoril.deviantart.com/ Not a good one, but whatever D:
<WereMay> 14that, it beautiful :3
<sally> :o
<sally> that's looks awesome sir!!
*sally likes it
<WereMay> 14<Kipi> Some of the art we'll be going over included the "Crucifixion", "Holy Trinity", "Birth of Venus", "Gate of Paradise", "Santo Spirito", "Last Supper", "David", "The Sistine Chapel", "School of Athens", Tempietto", Tempest", "Villa Rotunda", "Madona with the Long Neck", "Garden of Early Delights", "Isenheim Altarpiece", "Tres Riches du Duc de Berry", and the "G <-- oh yeah?
<sally> D: i want a picture!
<Kipi> oh
<WereMay> 14School of Athens was painted by Raphael
<WereMay> 14Last Supper, Da Vinci
<Andres> You want a picture? :o
<Kipi> Ghend Altarpiece
<WereMay> 14David was sculpted by Michelangelo
<Kipi> XP I know the obvious ones
<sally> ya :3.
<WereMay> 14ghend altarpiece?
<WereMay> 14never heard of that one
<Kipi> That's the last one that was cut off
*sally wants the Andres to draw a panda and a kitty :3
<WereMay> 14hmm
<Kipi> It's a triptych piece. The only one at the time that opens up twice.
<Hawkie> 07Gate of paradise.
<WereMay> 14I've seen Ghend Altarpiece, but I can't recall where
<WereMay> 14but I've definiately seen it
<WereMay> 14in a book or something
<Kipi> The gates of paradise were sculpted by.... Barricianno, I think. About 1460, and.... it was named such because some guy said the doors were so beautiful, they "could be the very gates to paradise".
<Kipi> I was wrong

<Kipi> Next one?
<WereMay> 14Tempest
<Kipi> X.x
<Kipi> Giorgianno
<Kipi> No idea on what the date could be
<WereMay> 14check your answer?
<Kipi> After I answer
<Kipi> It was done in the Northen Italian Renaissance style. One important fact about it was that the picture symbolized that everything must come to an end, except... Jesus and Mary; from Mary, comes life
<Espeon> o~
<Kipi> Woo
<Kipi> I was right-ish
<Kipi> Except his name is spelled "Giorgione
<Kipi> 1505-1510

*Kipi pounces ChinChilla
<The_Luginator> 02Boink
*Kipi snuggles up Chin very thoroughly
<ChinChilla> 14I might need a guide to how to, well, moderate. Owo
<Ray> 02HI KIPI :3
<ChinChilla> 14Hey, Kipi.

*Espeon dies
<The_Luginator> 02XD
<Umbreon> 12lol drf, i love how the tracker for the HDMI cables states that it left california, then the next place it stopped was in wisconsin
<Espeon> but I see where your confusion comes from, it's really not that obvious
*WereMay murrs
<ChinChilla> 14Let's see, I've found where to lock a thread.
<ChinChilla> 14:P
<Kipi> Hullo, Ray, ChinChilla, Chimera, ChinChilla, Umbreon, WereMay, and Umbreon.
<Umbreon> 12for some reason i highly doubt it made a straight trip from california to wisconsin without stops by car
<The_Luginator> 02First, you need to be mean to everybody who doesn't agree!
<Sneas> D:
*The_Luginator hides
<Aurora> 6all of the modding buttons are on the bottom
<Armads> I disagree.
<Kipi> & Aurora
<Espeon> Aurora: Nothing on the bottom for me, only like modify/delete any post o.O
<Aurora> 6you should see a merge button
<Espeon> but then again, non-global moderators != moderators, technically we're normal users with extra permissions.
*Umbreon gives Espeon some glasses
<Aurora> 6but merge doesn't work atm |D
<WereMay> 14uhh
<The_Luginator> 02Cool
<WereMay> 14what
<Aurora> 6wait
*The_Luginator puts on his Shades
<Aurora> 6board mods might not have merge
<Espeon> oh lol WUT
<Espeon> it is all the way at the bottom
<Espeon> but my point still stands.
<Espeon> sort of
<ChinChilla> 14Buh? O.o
<The_Luginator> 02Cookies are evil?
<ChinChilla> 14Merge is where?
<Espeon> right over the quick reply box
<Espeon> which is my main weapon
*Espeon dies again

<Articuno> 12<ChinChilla> Last time I checked, although moderator status was given, powers were not. <-- Are you sure..? >v<
<Ray> 02THAT ISN'T MEEE!!!!
<Ray> 02ARRRRGGGG
<The_Luginator> 02Yes it is!
<Umbreon> 12i know it doesn't even make sense
<Aurora> 6espeon has it apparently
<Ray> 02prove it!
<ChinChilla> 14Arti, maybe I wasn't expecting it where it was.
<ChinChilla> 14For example, my moderator adjustments in the sprite gallery:
<ChinChilla> 14It was pretty obvious from the main page
<Aurora> 6sometimes obvious isn't the answer
<Aurora> 6you do have the powers though, right?
<Espeon> It should be when it comes to interfaces
*Espeon dies
<Articuno> 12Oh um, check any topic in the boards you mod
<Espeon> again
<Articuno> 12See if you have options to lock tc.
<Articuno> 128etc

<WereMay> 14I've always been a natural brown :3
<drfsupercenter> 03wait ARti's leaving? :<
<HyperMetalLugia> 02I've always had black
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Or dark
<Aurora> 6oh and then my hair can't decide if its wavy or straight
<Armads> My hair's pretty black lol
*HyperMetalLugia can't decide on his hair colour
<Armads> Same color as my eyes, I think.
<Umbreon> 12hmm
<Aurora> 6the top hairs are straight, the hair underneath though is wavy as heck
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Same here
<Armads> It's just like those imitation leather seat coverings.
<Aurora> 6as soon as I do my usual hair style, you see the curls lol
<Armads> It looks black at first, then you shine a really bright light at it
<Armads> and then discover it's just dark purple.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Dark Brown at the "fringe"
<Armads> My hair's like that only less expensive.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02My hair costs 25$ every three months
<Armads> Ten dollars every three or four months versus a car.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Or 4 months
<Armads> lol
<HyperMetalLugia> 02I went over 6 months once...
<HyperMetalLugia> 02It was LOONG
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Too long
<Armads> Once mine reaches a certain length it gets ridiculous to comb.
<Armads> I hate it.
<Armads> Because then I have to spend ten bucks.
<Armads> I don't know how people deal with hair over like, two centimeters long.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02HML HAIR PIC

<Chimera> "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!"
<Skylands> 10Oh
<Aurora> 6I never caught on though
<HyperMetalLugia> 02I can't learn a new language....
<Aurora> 6I could learn enough for the tests, but my mind doesn't connect the language well
<Skylands> 10you meant fluently
<HyperMetalLugia> 02I just remeber it all
<WereMay> 14yeah.. new language
<Hyper_Ray_breeee> 02why not HML?

<WereMay> 14and only Spanish
<WereMay> 14I consider this racisit
<Aurora> 6although, I'm pretty decent reading and writing it
<HyperMetalLugia> 02EWWWW FRENCH CLASSS
<Aurora> 6more reading though
<Skylands> 10Most people have to be surrounded around the given language to understand it well
<Feather> 10BACK
<HyperMetalLugia> 02reading too
<Aurora> 6I know terms better than actually putting them into sentences
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Same
<Skylands> 10Same here
<Aurora> 6yeah, my friend is majoring in spanish now, she learned pretty well
<HyperMetalLugia> 02:(
<Aurora> 6she just got home from study abroad in spain
<Skylands> 10but Spanish 3 requires alot of sentences, so I'm steadily learning new things
<Chimera> FEATHER

<Skylands> 10then again, it's only first semester

<Skylands> 10Mostly review from last year's class
<Hyper_Ray_breeee> 02my schools english teacher... is badd
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Conjugating isn't too hard
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Well in M3/Grade 8 it wasn't
<Skylands> 10I just wish they'd offer Japanese at my school
<Hyper_Ray_breeee> 02LOL me 2
<Aurora> 6I wouldn't take japanese anyways
<Aurora> 6I'd still take spanish
<Skylands> 10I might do better in that class, because I happen to be more interested in Japanese culture
<Aurora> 6far more useful
<Armads> I wish my high school didn't fail.

<Armads> I don't remember middle school.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02You didn't?
<Quilava> hi
<Armads> It might not have happened.
<Skylands> 10Students were more concerned about their social life than anything else in middle
<Armads> High school I hated.
<Aurora> 6skylands, sounds like high school lol
<Umbreon> 12hi there quil

<Kipikipo> OHMYGODIFORGOT
<Aurora> 6in high school, you worry about popularity, what makes you "an outcast", clique stuff, etc
<Aurora> 6graduating high school is entering life
<Lyon> 04in college
<Lyon> 04you don't give a damn
<Armads> It's cool, eventually you'll forget all about high school.
<Armads> Like me.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02I'm always a "outcast"...
<Aurora> 6college, life 101, it's all different
<Icey> trust someone to ave the same nick :3
<Armads> It's like putting your hand on a hot stove for four years.

<Icey> :3
<Armads> Go to the right college.
<Kipikipo> I promised my highschool principal that I'd make a presentation at school about how highschool sucks and life gets better when you graduate and go to college
<Ray> 02<%Aurora> in high school, you worry about popularity, what makes you "an outcast", clique stuff, etc <--- FAKE, for me at least. i don't even care of other peoples think abaut me

<HyperMetalLugia> 02XD
<Aurora> 6you see, most people /say/ that, but in fact people /do/care
<Armads> You won't have to seclude yourself if you hang around the right people.
<Aurora> 6whether or not they admit it actually can't be helped sometimes
<Armads> Thing is, in high school there's no such thing as the right people.
<Armads> But college is different.
<Armads> Because you can choose.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02"Right People" are hard to find here...
<Aurora> 6the right people is however you decide you can trust
<Aurora> 6I found that in people younger than me -_-
<Armads> There are wrong people to trust.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02I have some old friends
<Armads> Those are everywhere.
<Armads> Like me!

<drfsupercenter> 03but most people like 2003 so that's the one I'm hosting
<Altair> I also found floppies of the suite before it was Office
<HyperMetalMoon> 02Thats better
<Altair> just Powerpoint, Word, etc
<Armads> I liked 03. After that they started being Apple.
<WereMay> 14drf
<Altair> 2000 was the best
<Creideiki> Awesome.
<WereMay> 14PM me directions, actually
<Armads> Fancying everything up and making it unusable.
<Creideiki> I didn't really like 2K. It just felt rather... clunky.
<HyperMetalMoon> 02Just like Paint
<Ray> 02MICROSOFT OFFICE 2003 FTW!!!!!!!!!!
<Altair> The new menu thing was pointless
<HyperMetalMoon> 02YEAH

<True_ai> 0406Example -04 Hurricanes are far more powerful then the storms the sky creates on its own. They are just another reason the ocean must be destroyed.

<Lambda> oh wait. Non-parasitic
<SparkyTheBat> 2it's probably Tumbler or something *shrugs*
<Lambda> so then not scary
<SparkyTheBat> 2*Tumblr

<Lambda> speaking of cats
<Lambda> I wants one :(
<HyperMetalLugia> !define noob
<[TST]Bot> -!- Newbie is a slang term for a newcomer to an Internet activity, for example online gaming. It can also be used to indicate an individual inexperienced in any other activity. It can have derogatory connotations, but is also often used for descriptive purposes only, without a value judgment.
<sally> me too :|
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Hmm...
<Ascendant> It has several different !pokemon-like scripts, although the main one would be a script on a bot called Nightshadow|VNC.
<Proto> I want a pet that doesn't die in a week.
<SparkyTheBat> 2o3o aahahaha
<Lambda> D:
<Stormy> I should adopt a kitty and keep it in my dorm

<Proto> I meant a girl, but I think I'll save some time and just anticipate the 'No.' and buy a new flashlight.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Well... you just comment about the things nobody else wonders about
<Altair> :D
<Ascendant> I have no comment.
<Skylands> 10Ascendant is into philosophy is my guess

<Skylands> 4 Zapdos is paired with n2
<Zapdos> nou
*HyperMetalLugia thinks he somewhat over observes...
<Ascendant> You can't over observe.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Anyway, i'm pretty much the laugh track in a show... for comic relief on a Movie
<Ascendant> You are also correct, Skylands, I am into Philosophy.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02-f
<Proto> ...and mace me?
*sally pokes Armageddon
*Armageddon pokes sally.

<Skylands> 10'Twas only a joke
<sally> save for an apartment

<Lambda> sorry LaptopAristeo
*Lambda bakes some cookies to apologize

*Umbreon still belongs to Armageddon for 2 more minutes
<LaptopAristeo> She hasn't talked to me though
<HyperMetalLugia> 02?.?
<Skylands> 10HML, Chimera wants to be original and use a variation
<Lambda> Wouldn't that be conflict of interest? ;)
<LaptopAristeo> She thinks she's soooooooo cool because she's running that she doesn't have to talk to the little people
<Lambda> that makes it sound like you dom't like her =/
<Stormy> So why do you want to date her then? o.O
<Lambda> *don't
<LaptopAristeo> Oh, I'm being sarcastic :3
<LaptopAristeo> I tried to talk to her on the Facebook IM thingy and she didn't respond

<Theguesst> No u!
<Chimera> I mean really
<Umbreon> 12i really want to finish round 2 Theguesst
<Chimera> It's frikkin' ridiculace
<Umbreon> 12so i can start round 3 XD
<Soyuz> Why?
<Chimera> Because
<Theguesst> I know you do, glac
<Soyuz> Because America needs more resources
*HyperWhovianLugia jumps into TG, and rolls all over hime
<Chimera> Greed is costing people's lives
<Umbreon> 12doesn't everyone?
<Soyuz> easy as that
<Chimera> We HAVE resources
<Theguesst> Who will I face in round 3 if I win?
<Soyuz> lol
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02ME
<Umbreon> 12dunno yet
<Umbreon> 12it's random
<Chimera> We just use oil instead of other products
<Soyuz> you think the rich and powerful give a fuck if we 'have' resources?
<Chimera> Which is retarded
<Theguesst> K
<Chimera> No
<Chimera> Unfortunately
<Umbreon> 12no guarentees
<Soyuz> the claiming of more resources, and profits for their markets is that concerns them
<Chimera> But someone, SOMEONE should step up and say that it's enough
<Umbreon> 12but probably aero or manlyguy
<Soyuz> if people die, then they die
<Soyuz> Chimera; we do
<Umbreon> 12or you will randomly be paired down
<Soyuz> just that then we're viewed as 'extremists'
<Soyuz> 'terrorists'
<Umbreon> 12since there will be 3 undefeated people
<Zapdos> if one person steps up and says no, 100 others will step up and try to kill them
<Soyuz> the correct term being 'communists' :P
<Chimera> Dude, they die BECAUSE OF THE WAR
<Chimera> and lol
<Chimera> How about this
<Zapdos> which happens repeatedly
<Theguesst> Mmhmm
<Soyuz> Chimera; well yes
<Soyuz> and no
<Chimera> We take a look at our damn constitution
<Umbreon> 12but yeah
<Soyuz> and our 'god give rights' ;p
<Umbreon> 12if you won
<Chimera> And tell the polititions that they're blinded by greed
<Umbreon> 12you would be 2/0, aero would be 2/0, and manlyguy would be 2/0
<Soyuz> but really, when has the constituion been...good?
<Theguesst> Don't you love how you always kill the main chat when you talk to me?
<Chimera> In fact I say we make a mile-long petition
<Chimera> A lot of times actually
<Umbreon> 12don't give me too much credit
<Theguesst> Just noticed
<Soyuz> After amended
<Soyuz> before?
<Umbreon> 12it's a bad time
<Chimera> Protecting rights and what not
<Soyuz> No
<Soyuz> lol
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02XD....
<Soyuz> protecting rights?
<Chimera> :P
<Chimera> Yeah
<Chimera> It's written there
<Chimera> But nobody cares >_>
<Soyuz> Yea, tell that to the Japanese prisoners, or African civil right leaders, or even muslims today
<Chimera> Honestly
<Soyuz> about how they are 'protected'
<Soyuz> in a true word we have 10 privilges
<Soyuz> which can be easily taken away if we are a threat to their regime o3o
<Chimera> Someone should get a polotition and make him feel pain like death
<Chimera> *politition
<Soyuz> a right, can not be taken away
<Soyuz> a privilge, can
<Umbreon> 12hmm
<Umbreon> 12only 2 people haven't won a match yet
<Soyuz> thats the difference
<Chimera> Lol
<Chimera> True
<Umbreon> 12that makes pairings easier XD
<Chimera> Still
<Chimera> Higher ups seem to think this: $
<Chimera> Is more valuable than this
<Chimera> <===
<Soyuz> thats how class conflict works
<Soyuz> they dont care about you as a person
<Soyuz> object
<Soyuz> or tool
<Chimera> Exactly
<Soyuz> you're just a thing to be used
<Chimera> They care about money
<Soyuz> untill your done
<Chimera> And that's fvcked up
<Chimera> Amirite?
<Soyuz> been that way for 500 years
<Soyuz> its been fucked up
<Chimera> Yep
<Umbreon> 12it's hard to keep this tournament managed, i have to keep track of who has fought who, and what everyone's battle record is
<Chimera> That REALLY needs to be changed
<Umbreon> 12after round 4 i have to calculate everyone's resistence
<Aeroslash> night all
<Soyuz> Well you wont find it in a president
<Soyuz> reformism =/= change
<Chimera> Unfortunately -_-

<Umbreon> 12bye aeroslash

<Soyuz> Good, for that'd be silly
<drfsupercenter> 03it's one of Aeroslash's IRL friends
<Latias_loves_you> yes :)
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02Oh...
<Chimera> And resources will be deminished
<Soyuz> Thats only if the war is important enough to the goverment
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02Interesting
<Latias_loves_you> ...i pretty amazing..soo im told

<Chimera> But I do want action to be taken
*Chimera is sick of the world :E

<Jerry> 2drf: any knowledge of Linux btw?~
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah what'd you need to know?
*Light_Latias thought so
<Neon> Dude, are you familiar with the Higgs bosom?
<Lambda> though shalt not shush or else the punishment is to be shushed
<ixr> Silence
<Neon> *boson
<Jerry> 2drf: okay, so I installed OpenSUSE on my laptop, its a dual boot with Windows 7
<Lambda> yeah, it's gonna blow up the world
<Neon> If it exists.
<Jerry> 2but now, thing is, when I use OpenSUSE to try and connect to my wifi. it doesnt connect at all
<Lambda> :O
<Neon> Even then, we won't be alive to see that. The supervolcanoes will get us first. xD
<Lambda> but, but, but, the TV said it did!
<drfsupercenter> 03that's a driver issue
<ixr> Quiet
<Jerry> 2oh, I see.
<Jerry> 2hm..I suspected so
<Lambda> Or the dinosaurs
<Neon> They're not sure if it actually exists.
<Neon> If it does, our concept of mass and photons is all wrong.
<Jerry> 2hm..do you know how to get ndiswrapper configured then? sorry I'm a bit of a beginner at Linux~
<drfsupercenter> 03not really :/
<drfsupercenter> 03I have an Intel wi-fi chip and it just works
<Jerry> 2ouch,kays~
<Jerry> 2thanks tho
*HyperMetalLugia has a wirless dongle

<HyperMetalLugia> 02From Amazon of course
<HyperMetalLugia> 02What LL?
<Light_Latias> 12I misread that...
<Lambda> so would that make that app a scam?
<Neon> Haha, it /always was/ a scam.
<ixr> App?
<ixr> I heard app
<ixr> Itouch app
<Lambda> An app used to create matter
<Chimera> LOL!!
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Of course you did...
<Lambda> didn't you know about it?
<Chimera> Jerry
<Jerry> 2yeah Chimy?~
<Chimera> I have Wi-Fi work perfectly
<Chimera> I use Ubuntu
<Lambda> yes, you can touch this app
<Chimera> :P
<Jerry> 2oh, I see..
<Chimera> On an OLD LAPTOP
<Chimera> :E
<Jerry> 2is Ubuntu good?
<Chimera> Yes very
<Neon> You can even taste it.
<Theguesst> Yes
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Nao?
<Jerry> 2okay..
<Neon> Every app on this iPod is eatable, even I am eatable.
<Jerry> 2I might be tempted to switch to that~ :D
<Theguesst> Except for the fact that apple hates it
<Lambda> You can use it for pretty much anything
<Chimera> I can't see why a lot of people say it's bad though
<HyperMetalLugia> 02:(
<Chimera> no
<Chimera> That makes it good
<drfsupercenter> 03it does XD
<HyperMetalLugia> 02It's too niche'
<Theguesst> No iTunes syncing
<drfsupercenter> 03EW ITUNES

<Chimera> XD
<Theguesst> That's why I didn't like it
<HyperMetalLugia> 02EWWW
<Chimera> Yeah
<Jerry> 2Apple=money grubbers
<Chimera> Theguesst
<drfsupercenter> 03Ubuntu 10.04 supports iPods, therefore it fails in my eyes :(
<Stormy> Earbuds are eatable?
*Umbreon noms Jerry
<Theguesst> iPod touch
*Stormy eats Lambda's earbuds
<Chimera> Shut up drf LOL
*Jerry is nommed~
<HyperMetalLugia> 02O_0
<ixr> Nummy
<Neon> Like I said, everything is eatable.
<Chimera> It works as a perfect alternative
<Jerry> 2drfsupercenter: apparently anything with the word Apple or Mac seems to fail in your eyes
<Theguesst> Doesn't work with ios devices
<Chimera> And drf realize this
<Neon> But eating other people is called cannibalism, my dear children...
<drfsupercenter> 03Jerry, duh
<Lambda> Are pancakes eatable?
<Jerry> 2lol
<Neon> ...and is frownded upon in civilized nations.
<Umbreon> 12he doesn't mind the fruit
<Neon> *frowned
<Chimera> If a product doesn't appeal to almost every end user
<Jerry> 2Umbreon: O.o. I see
<Chimera> You lose customers
<Neon> Lambda: No... no, no. That's the singular exception.
<drfsupercenter> 031. Ubuntu is free
<Chimera> Even though Ubuntu is free LOL
*Kipikipo returns
<drfsupercenter> 03what "customers"
*Jerry turns drfsupercenter into the boss for Apple~
<drfsupercenter> 03they arne't paying
<Chimera> ... XD
*Jerry gets shot
<Umbreon> 12i don't know what he thinks about big macs from mcdonalds though
<drfsupercenter> 032. Linux hardly appeals to anyone but hardcore techies anyway
<HyperMetalLugia> 02XD
<drfsupercenter> 03and what the frick hardcore techie likes Apple
<HyperMetalLugia> 02True
<Lambda> Awww
<drfsupercenter> 03therefore I rest my case.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Nobody
<Chimera> Good point
*Kipikipo immediately hugs Jerry and no one else~<3
<Neon> Hehe, flapjacks.
*Jerry huggles Kipikipo back~
<Stormy> D:
<Stormy> but...
<Stormy> I like pancakes
<Jerry> 2drf: so basically, Linux are for hardcore techies only? O.o
<Lambda> What if they're chocolate chip?
<HyperMetalLugia> 02OF COURSE
<Stormy> I just ate them for breakfast this morning
<Neon> It's for the great good, people!
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<Neon> *greater
<Jerry> 2LOL! Okay..
<Lambda> doesn't chocolate make all that was once eatable into something that is eatable?
<Lambda> *uneatable
<Neon> :P http://www.theonion.com/articles/un-appoints-first-ambassador-to-aliens,18195/
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Why would you want a pengiun to be the mascot of your OS?
<Neon> Chocolate certain has leverage in this argument, but I'm not sure it can overturn the Law Of Eatable Properties.
<Neon> *certainly
<Chimera> Hm
<Chimera> Well Ubuntu IS free
<Chimera> So
<Chimera> Since people would want an OS they don't need to pay for
<Chimera> They could probably get that
<Chimera> And then use whatever MP3 player they have with it
<Chimera> Preferrably NOT an iPod but still xD
<Lambda> "In the past, the aliens had to take themselves out to Red Robin, and that is just unacceptable."

<HyperMetalLugia> 02PIZZAPIE
<Chimera> I have a foolproof meathof of recording videos and proving them to be real

<drfsupercenter> 03Chimera, a camera?
<HyperMetalLugia> 02OLRY?
*drfsupercenter runs
<Chimera> No
<Umbreon> 12remember them?
<Umbreon> 12and say what happened
<drfsupercenter> 03dude
<Chimera> 2 of them
<drfsupercenter> 03you could photoshop a camera
<drfsupercenter> 03that proves nothing
<Chimera> LISTEN!
<drfsupercenter> 03NO
<Chimera> MY GOD
<Chimera> >_>
<Chimera> F*ck you
<Umbreon> 12Chimera
*Chimera flees
<drfsupercenter> 03I know what you're getting at but you could easily fake that
<Umbreon> 12speak your mind
<Chimera> K
<Chimera> You record the event with both cameras
<Chimera> When the event is over turn off ONE camera
<Chimera> And show yourself uploading the video to Youtube
<Chimera> Or something
<drfsupercenter> 03which then involves uploading the second video
<drfsupercenter> 03which could easily be faked
<Chimera> Then end the proof video and upload that
<Chimera> :E
<Chimera> ...
<drfsupercenter> 03to make it look like you filmed a video of you filming a video
<Chimera> It shows the process of you filming
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but you could easily fake that
<Chimera> And then uploading RIGHT WHEN IT'S DONE
<Chimera> no
<Chimera> I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03.....
<drfsupercenter> 03OMG you are so naive
<drfsupercenter> 03Have you ever heard of PAUSING?
<Chimera> Thw second the video is done you upload it
<Chimera> Yes
<Umbreon> 12Chimera you have to upload the 2nd video as well to prove it happened
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah and what I'm saying is the second video could be entirely fake
<drfsupercenter> 03as in
<Chimera> ... YOU DO THAT
<Umbreon> 12and that is the lapse that has no video evidence
<drfsupercenter> 03yea
<drfsupercenter> 03h
<drfsupercenter> 03Umbreon knows what I'm getting at
<Chimera> Gah
<drfsupercenter> 03I could shoot a video of myself taking a camera, taking the memory card, putting it in my computer and uploading it
<HyperMetalLugia> 02I haz a Coolpix P1
<Chimera> I mean no pausing in the video whatsoever
<Neon> LOL: *picture of Obama* Black Guy Asks Nation For Change.
<Umbreon> 12even if you turn the first camera on
<drfsupercenter> 03I could also put an entirely fake video on that memory card
<drfsupercenter> 03therefore FAKING THE ENTIRE THING
<Umbreon> 12there is still a moment where one of the cameras is off
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Hmm...
<Chimera> MY FFFFING GOD
<Umbreon> 12and you can't prove only like 5 seconds passed between turning a camera on and off
<drfsupercenter> 03point being, Chimera, it's the Internet. Nothing can be proven. *NOTHING*
<Chimera> THE WHOLE VIDEO HAS NO PAUSE
<Lambda> we saw a bumper sticker like that the other day
<drfsupercenter> 03HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT YOU DIDN'T USE PAUSE
<HyperMetalLugia> 02NO pAUSE... MADNESS
<Umbreon> 12then even if you do
<Chimera> okay
<HyperMetalLugia> 02!madness
<Lambda> "When he's done all you'll have left is change"
<Chimera> Tell me how I can pause perfectly
<Stormy> :P
<Chimera> On both videos
<Chimera> Tell me that
<drfsupercenter> 03you only need to pause on one
<Chimera> Still
<drfsupercenter> 03you pause as soon as you turn the camera off...
<drfsupercenter> 03the first camera
<Umbreon> 12Chimera
<drfsupercenter> 03then go edit the video
<drfsupercenter> 03and resume
<Umbreon> 12the best way to prove something
<drfsupercenter> 03it's really not rocket science
<Chimera> Tell me how the transition can be 100% accurate
<drfsupercenter> 03Did you not hear what I JUST said
<Chimera> ...
<Chimera> Yes
<Umbreon> 12is to say what happened and have video evidence, don't go out of your way to try breaking people will call it fake, its their loss if they don't believe you
<drfsupercenter> 03you use a video editing program
<Chimera> But
<drfsupercenter> 03make an entirely fake video
<drfsupercenter> 03put it on your camera's memory card.
<Chimera> I have to be in the same position
<drfsupercenter> 03Then make a video of you supposedly filming it
<Chimera> Same EVERYTHING
<drfsupercenter> 03and you show you putting the memory card in your computer
<drfsupercenter> 03which has a *FAKE* video on it
<Chimera> but what if the proof video is attached to my shirt or somethig?
<Neon> Well, I must heet hay.
<Umbreon> 12why are we even arguing this guys?
<Lambda> night Neeawn
<Jerry> 2Objection
<Umbreon> 12the thing is
<Umbreon> 12that there is ways to look at a video
<Chimera> Because people seem to think anything and everything is fake
<Chimera> Which is sad
<Stormy> See ya
<Umbreon> 12and tell if it was tampered with or not
<drfsupercenter> 03because it IS fake
*drfsupercenter runs
<Umbreon> 12people can actually analyze that
<Chimera> Shut UP drf
<Chimera> I MEAN IT
<Chimera> And yes Umbreon
*drfsupercenter coughs *oversensitive*
<Chimera> No
<Theguesst> STFU
<Umbreon> 12there are professionals who make a living doing that sort of
<Chimera> You just don't know when to be quiet sometimes
<HyperMetalLugia> 02MAN SHADDIUP....
<Chimera> Yes bree
*Theguesst throws a cup of STFU at drf
<Chimera> Now listen
<Chimera> I never let the proof video be still
<Charles> rawr
<Chimera> So if it's paused in the slightest you'd be able to make that out
<drfsupercenter> 03you're underestimating just how easy it is for someone to find flaws
<Chimera> Drf
<Chimera> What the hell makes you think there WOULD be flaws?!
<drfsupercenter> 03because no video is 100% guaranteed to be not fake
<drfsupercenter> 03for example
*sally turns Charles into a pillow and goes to sleep
<drfsupercenter> 03you say you never sit still... I'd hate to see you upload a video to YouTube
<drfsupercenter> 03say you sit down in your chair
<drfsupercenter> 03pause the second camera
<drfsupercenter> 03go edit the first video
<drfsupercenter> 03on another computer
<drfsupercenter> 03then just sit back down, resume
<drfsupercenter> 03it's really not rocket science...
<Kyu> 07because the harder someone tries to make it look as real as possible, that just raises more suspicion that it's fake
<Kyu> 07o3o

<Kyu> 07haters gonna hate
<Kyu> 07=P
<Charles> well, just Lady....only ever had the one girlfriend
<Stormy> CODE MONKEY
<drfsupercenter> 03because it's easy to fake even a 'proof' video
<Charles> and not even she calls me Mr. Snuggles
<drfsupercenter> 03prime example, America's Funniest Home Videos, XD
<drfsupercenter> 03most of those are fake...
<drfsupercenter> 03does anyone care? No, they're still entertaining
<HyperMetalLugia> 02:o
<Chimera> I'm trying to develop a meathod that breaks that
<Chimera> -_-
<Chimera> Not that damn it
<drfsupercenter> 03well you just keep trying
<drfsupercenter> 03because it's not gonna happen
<Chimera> I mean other stuff
<Kyu> 07basically the best way to say it isn't fake is to just tape it, upload it, and say nothing at all
<Chimera> But you know what?
<Chimera> Neverming
<Chimera> *d
<drfsupercenter> 03OK I think I'll use Chimera's method to go film a UFO right now and prove that it's real
<drfsupercenter> 03who's with me
*drfsupercenter hides
<HyperMetalLugia> 02:LOL
<Kyu> 07that's the only way to get the smallest amount of people who would say it's fake
<Chimera> >_>
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah exactly
<sally> ooooh
<drfsupercenter> 03like the guy who filmed the video of that PS3 Jailbreak thing
<drfsupercenter> 03he made a second video showing his first one wasn't fake
<drfsupercenter> 03what happens
<drfsupercenter> 03more people say it's fake
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<sally> is mr. snuggles the g-rated version? :o
<sally> :p
<Chimera> But why
<Umbreon> 12drfsupercenter make sure to let me know when you get the package if it comes tomorrow
<Chimera> That's just stupid
<Umbreon> 12and verify that all the games are there
<drfsupercenter> 03but why what?
<Charles> depends on the amount of clothing involved
<Charles> Snuggling has no set requirements
<Chimera> You're trying to prove something real so people won't act retarded goin "LOL FAKE."
<Umbreon> 12i would be extremely greatful if you can provide this for me
<Chimera> What's the problem in that
<Umbreon> 12Chimera
<drfsupercenter> 03no, people thought his first one was fake because he never showed the PS3 during the process
<Kyu> 07Chimera, you could make a hundred video cameras filming each other in a chain to try and prove how real something is, but there's still not total proof that it would be 100% real
<Umbreon> 12people will always be ignorant
<Umbreon> 12even with all the proof in the world
<Kyu> 07it would just be EXTREMELY difficult to pull it off
<Umbreon> 12they will still choose to call it fake because they don't want to believe it
<Kyu> 07but it could still be faked
<Umbreon> 12and nothing but
<sally> i see, i see.
<Theguesst> Indeed, glac
<drfsupercenter> 03basically, the only way to prove that it's not fake, is to see it with your own eyes.
<Chimera> Why does Adobe's products have to exist
<drfsupercenter> 03Period.
<drfsupercenter> 03who the frick uses Adobe for video editing?
<Chimera> Or any video editing software for that matter
<Chimera> >_>
<Charles> Ahhhhhh!!!!! Spider!!!!
<Chimera> After Effects
<drfsupercenter> 03because without them I couldn't make AMVs?
<Chimera> And a lot of peiple
<drfsupercenter> 03EW ADOBE

<drfsupercenter> 03TBH
<Chimera> Orly
<Umbreon> 12a lot of people are ignorant and stupid
*Charles calls in a cat to have it eat the 8 legged freak instead
<Umbreon> 12that's the definition of the human race

<drfsupercenter> 03Yeah I have
<drfsupercenter> 03and what ends up happening
<Charles> glad you know of it
<Chimera> That's why I wanted to find a meathod to somehow prove it to be real without some idiots claiming it fake
<Chimera> :|
<drfsupercenter> 03is I zone out and go "WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?>!>!?!?!?!?!?"
<drfsupercenter> 03so instead I prefer listening to someone read it to me

<drfsupercenter> 03No zoning out, etc.

<Feather|Reading> 10You must be speed reading then

<Mikey> swaffy says that the word d a m n isn't in the bible
<WitchRoara> 6oh yeah I saw that |D

<Lambda> the other one was DeathMantis
<Mikey> because he obviously hasn't read it
<Things> Where are they?

<DeathMantis> the other is from the authorities they're onto you
<Things> Ah right

<DeathMantis> run things!!!!
<Mikey> so he's not as faithful to his religion as he's pretending to be, or that's how I see it
<Lambda> DeathMantis = The authorities
<DeathMantis> lmao
<Guest98485> Uh oh
<Mikey> I think that if he thinks so strongly about it he should actually know what it's about
<Guest98485> oh hai where
*DeathMantis has forgotten where he put Things

<Stormy> ChanServ is probably pregnant
*LaptopAristeo peeks in Mikey's ears to check for preggers
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate LCDs but :/
<LambderDaGuyWhoIsOverDer> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlBiLNN1NhQ
<drfsupercenter> 03anything else was "too big" and tooe xpensive
<drfsupercenter> 03I got this thing for $400
<Umbreon> 12400 isn't bad
<drfsupercenter> 03at home we've got a 50" plasma, that's seriously amazing
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Mikey> LaptopAristeo what
<drfsupercenter> 03I love ABC Warehouse for that
<Mikey> o___o;
<drfsupercenter> 03you can barter with them XD
<Umbreon> 12lol
<drfsupercenter> 03their list price was like $450
<LaptopAristeo> :o
<Mikey> chanesrv is pregnant with mrbot's baby
<drfsupercenter> 03and I was all "eh, that's a bit pricy" and the guy was like "tell you what, I'll give it to you for $400"
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like OK
<Umbreon> 12i'm curious what happens
<LaptopAristeo> Preggers are very dangerous creatures
<Umbreon> 12if you plug a surge protector into a surge protector
<Umbreon> 12lol
<LaptopAristeo> You can't be too careful
<drfsupercenter> 03absolutely nothing
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm doing it right now
<Umbreon> 12you never know until you get a power spike
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03well I'm in a dorm, I doubt we're gonna have that problem
<Mikey> apparently there'sa huge lice breakout here
<Mikey> I love not going to school
<Stormy> Eww
<Mikey> especially for stuff like that
<LambderDaGuyWhoIsOverDer> :D
<Umbreon> 12i'm just curious if you double them up, if it doubles the amount of spike that will go through
<Stormy> One of my friends in 5th grade had lice
<drfsupercenter> 03it shouldn't
<Stormy> She didn't come in for a few days
<LaptopAristeo> >.<
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, if you plug like, 15 of them in to each other
<drfsupercenter> 03then yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03but just plugging one into another should be fine
<Stormy> Apparently now they're saying you should still go to school if you have lice
<LoopyDood> Bleh
<LoopyDood> Who has Skype?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like how CHristmas lights say don't plug more than 3 in to one outlet, but I plug like 27 of them into each other xD
<Mikey> lol people are [censored]ing idiots
<LambderDaGuyWhoIsOverDer> XD
<Umbreon> 12lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm serious
*Stormy read that in a newspaper
<drfsupercenter> 03all my lights are plugged into one outlet

<drfsupercenter> 03which is then connected to a timer
<drfsupercenter> 03and we haven't had a fire yet so I'm good XD
<Mikey> IF YOU HAVE A DEADLY DISEASE THAT'S CATCHABLE YOU SHOULD STILL GO TO SCHOOL!!!!!
<LaptopAristeo> I don't see any situation where I could not go to school
<LambderDaGuyWhoIsOverDer> Deadly?
<Stormy> Lice are deadly
<Umbreon> 12imagine the horror drf, when parallel circuits weren't invented yet

<drfsupercenter> 03when you pull a light out
<drfsupercenter> 03the whole strand dies
<drfsupercenter> 03that's proof that they're wired in series
<Stormy> Someone last year got out of class by emailing the teacher and saying he had Swine Flu
<Umbreon> 12hmm i never had that happen
<Mikey> when I was in elementary school my mom would just pull me out saying I had a doctor appointment
<Umbreon> 12the the fact that "darnit... i have this cord of like 300 light bulbs, one of them is out...
<Mikey> I love elementary school getting outs
<Umbreon> 12"
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not talkinga bout burned out

<Mikey> I remember I hated my music teacher and my gym teacher
<drfsupercenter> 03and why they don't know XD
<drfsupercenter> 03*now
<Umbreon> 12i remember when he made us take apart old VCRs

<Umbreon> 12he just walks upto me, picks up the VCR and drops it on the ground XD
*LaptopAristeo is about to sleep
<LoopyDood> Damn.
<LambderDaGuyWhoIsOverDer> I never liked my gym teacher either
<LambderDaGuyWhoIsOverDer> or in high school

<LambderDaGuyWhoIsOverDer> we had a pure evil librarian
<Stormy> All music teachers think that :P
<LambderDaGuyWhoIsOverDer> my friend and I had theories about her evil plans to kidnap our other friend
<Mikey> I LOVED my librarian, during the summer when they had summer library checkout I'd stay at the school all day reorganizing the books people brought in and labelling the new ones
<Mikey> I never had any friends in school it was a great hobby for me
<LambderDaGuyWhoIsOverDer> That would be a fun job I think

<Reshiram> 6I downloaded each rar and extracted them
<Reshiram> 6eh
<drfsupercenter> 03the reason why
<drfsupercenter> 03is it's extracting all 6

<WereMay> 14Kyro, you just make the situation worse D:
<WereMay> 14I mean
<Kyro> not really May :/
<WereMay> 14I probably would have done that
<HyperMetalLugia> 02But he needed "JUSTICE"!
<WereMay> 14but, still
<WereMay> 14there's more ways than just revenge
*Gir uses /me to type in roleplay format.
<Gir> ;o
<Kyro> in my school, when you do something to someone cause THEY did something to you, it registers in there head NOT to mess with you
*HyperMetalLugia wonders why
<WereMay> 14well that's just silly, because, that's what high school to be everywhere
<Kyro> but IF you snitch, then more crap comes your way, half the highschoolers in my school are idiots anyway
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Oh high school...
*Gir answer with a simple 1I'm gunna go get my cocoa pebbles now.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02LOL
<WereMay> 14you don't get back at them as a message "don't mess with me" it just gets worse, because it provokes for more annoyance >>
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Control K and black in a desciptor
<WereMay> 14that just means responding is not the best thing
<Gir> I know alot of stuff from my good ol' java user days ;D
<WereMay> 14snitching is a choice, yes, but it doesn't mean trouble
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Or just quote the Terminator...
<WereMay> 14or you can simply ignore him
<WereMay> 14or tell him to back-off
<WereMay> 14but it's way better than the way you responded to his acts
<Gir> Beat the taturz out of him. :D
<WereMay> 14just sayin'
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Should of done a...
<Kyro> lol hence why in 8th grade someone kept throwing crap in my hair, i told him to stop, he kept doing it, so i reached around grabbed his gatorade bottle on his desk and smacked him in the face with it ^_^ and the cap was open so it went AAAALL over him :D
<HyperMetalLugia> 02!kyro
<HyperMetalLugia> 02NO barrelrolls?
<WereMay> 14Kyro, that just dubs you as a bully
<WereMay> 14trust me, I know

<Kyro> i had a problem, i took care of it
<WereMay> 14I used to go to a school in the freaking valley
<Gir> On blast from the past day last year an annoying kid who sat behind me kept balancing a ruler on my afro T~T
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Not really...
<WereMay> 14that the worst part of anywhere to go to school

<WereMay> 14Kyro, you didn't just "take care of it"
<HyperMetalLugia> 02It's evil...as we all know
<WereMay> 14you just made it worse >>
<Gir> I wonder if I still have that afro.... o-o *searches*
<Kyro> the teachers basically TELL you to do that XD, teachers quote: "Solve your own problems with students. I don't have the time i must teach" So, i solved my problem
<HyperMetalLugia> 02:o
<Gir> *turns around* OH NO IT'S GONE D:
<HyperMetalLugia> 02:O
<HyperMetalLugia> 02X.X
<WereMay> 14Kyro, it isn't a very good way to solve you problem
<WereMay> 14they teach you things for a reason
<Kyro> it IS though
<WereMay> 14you don't waste time time of irritating fools just so you can be an irritating idiot right back at them
*Kyro shrugs "i solve my problems and it works fine :D
<WereMay> 14>>
*HyperMetalLugia shrugs.. I just ignore them ALL
*WereMay goes back to the debate board
<Gir> If you beat the taturz out of them they wont mess with you anymore.
<Kyro> EXACTLY
*HyperMetalLugia is 12Testing 4COLOURIES
<Gir> Therefore stopping a continuous cycle of you getting annoyed
<Kyro> EXACTLY!!!
<Gir> if they are afraid of you, they wont do it
*HyperMetalLugia isn't a fighter...

*HyperMetalLugia isn't meanie...
<Gir> I get beat up all the time >:3
<Ray|EVILhomework> 02almost done, just a few minutes more Gir
<Kyro> im not bullying anyone either, bully's fight you for being "stupid" or for no reason, i have a reason for everything
<WereMay> 14and you know what Gir, most all bullies pick on other people continuosly because they're afraid of losing respect and power over one and another
<Gir> k
<WereMay> 14a wonderous cycle, isn't it?
*HyperMetalLugia is 4GOING TO KNOCK THEM ALL DOWN THE STAIRS!!

*HyperMetalLugia hides
<WereMay> 14HML, stfu
<WereMay> 14seriously
<Kyro> exactly, i dont care for "power" or "respect" i dont ever have em in school anyway, i learned that from my years from school >.> so i changed to work with my mind, it works fine how i do it now
<WereMay> 14getting into fights ruins your chance of being IN school
<Feather> DONE :D
<WereMay> 14yay :D
<Kyro> THATS WHY YOU DONT FIGHT XD
<Gir> My excuse would be 'The teachers said to take care of it myself, so I did.'
*HyperMetalLugia stuffs a large item into his mouth
<WereMay> 14Kyro, nonsense, that's what you did :P
*WereMay sighs
<WereMay> 14you guys are hopeless if you think that way
<Kyro> No, i merely dumped a bottle of whiteout on his jeans
*HyperMetalLugia doesn't think that way
<Gir> I'm not trying to start an arguement, I'm just saying, that would be my excue. o. o
<WereMay> 14which is highly RUDE
<Kyro> and thats EXACTLY what the teachers tell you XD

<Quilava> That's what happens when I mess with the router. :D
<Ray> 02what happen'd?
<Ray> 02lol
<Ray> 02is your Wi-Fi finnaly fixed?
<Quilava> Just checked.
<Quilava> Nope. x.x
<Ray> 02X_x
<Quilava> My mom's friend accessed the wireless last night and, me knowing instantly because I got cut off wi-fi, changed the security settings.
<Quilava> the password works but it still wont let me on.
<Quilava> Atleast, that's my moms theory as to why it wont connect.
<Quilava> If you ask me, the little internet symbol on the router not being lit up might have something to do with it.
<Kyro> anyway, imma bounce, so peace everybody

<HyperMetalLugia> 02HSX
<HyperMetalLugia> 02HML
<Umbreon> 12actually drfsupercenter i'm just going to say this
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Very alike
<Umbreon> 12it shames me to say it but i really don't think umbreon is canine or feline
<Umbreon> 12but an odd mix of the two
<HyperMetalLugia> 02:o
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Left4Latias> 12lol
<HyperMetalLugia> 02LOL
<Umbreon> 12it has both feline and canine features
<Umbreon> 12so it would just be easier to say its a combination of both
<Theguesst> It's a programed piece of coding
<Umbreon> 12oh
<Umbreon> 12?
<Umbreon> 12and literature is just words on a piece of paper
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Good one TG
<Umbreon> 12lol
<HyperMetalLugia> 02D
<Theguesst> It exists because it's developers needed a sprite for said character
<Umbreon> 12if i remember right
<Umbreon> 12the anime came before the game
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Say What?
<Umbreon> 12the animated series came before the video games
<Umbreon> 12meaning that it's a drawing first, and a programmed sprite 2nd
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Interesting
<Umbreon> 12i could be wrong though
<Umbreon> 12i have no way to prove it
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Use the power of Wikipedia!
<Theguesst> Or bulbapedia.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Either will do

<Draelen> eXAKR, the kill message clearly explained to you what the issue was ;p

<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Draelen: That clearly needs fixing XD
<Draelen> 06:51:10: -ocean.lugia.us- [Spamfilter] LugiaLordOfTheSeas!SaphiraxCy@x.basl.cable.virginmedia.com matches filter '^DCC SEND.*': [PRIVMSG #SilverWings: 'DCC Send'] [Killed (Network (DCC Client exploits are forbidden on this network))]
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> All I said was DCC Send
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> :P
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<Draelen> it was an old spamfilter placed to protect peoples connections being killed
<Reshiram> 6woah Draelen spoke :)
<Draelen> there is another variation of it which results in a gline
*Reshiram 6missed this
<Reshiram> 6hiiiiii draelen
*Draelen rawrs to Reshiram
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Even so, how does just simply saying "DCC Send" get you killed
<Aurora> 6forgot the name lol
<Umbreon> 12you want to protect peoples connections from being killed but then you have !pipe
<Draelen> well, that gets you killed because there is a spamfilter telling the server to kill you ;p
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Pfff XD
<Umbreon> 12lol
<Draelen> Umbreon, apply some logic ;p
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas goes back to working on his bot

<Draelen> I have trouble figuring out what from you is humour, and whats an actual question ;p
<eXAKR> Who? Me?
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas hopes Lyon gets on soon, tired Lugia
*Draelen applies some logic to eXAKR too
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> lol
<eXAKR> LOGIC!
<Draelen> if no one here has old sucky router gear, I can remove the simple dcc spamfilter variant
<eXAKR> I don't
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I has NetGear routers so :3
<Draelen> I'll not test in here because you lot would likely start pasting back and forth ;p

<Creideiki> Hyper: What lang are you programming in?
<HyperProgrammingLugia> 02Overly Basic C++
<HyperProgrammingLugia> 02And it's purpose is to...
<Ascendant> Speaking of programming, I'm going to do some programming now.
<Ray> 02EPIC BGM IS FREAKING EPIC </random>
<HyperProgrammingLugia> 02I'm mauling my .txt Reader into a *IT*
<HyperProgrammingLugia> 02I've finsihed the first one, but I'm wondering if I should make another one...
<Ascendant> C++ is slightly weird.
<Ascendant> Too many brackets and semicolons to take care of. It's rather complicated.
<Creideiki> Hyper: Okay... now remake that exact same program... in assembler.
<HyperProgrammingLugia> 02It is fussy about the caps, and case of the Variables
<Ascendant> It is, and assembler...no way.
<HyperProgrammingLugia> 02And those darn bracets
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Ruby script is more annoying :P
<HyperProgrammingLugia> 02I'm only going to compile it into a .exe
<Ascendant> Fortran is also something I'd rather stay away from.
<Ascendant> Ruby script isn't that good.
<Creideiki> The one problem with C and C++. Yeah... compilers usually have a modicum of "SIEG HEIL!" when writing the code. :P
<Ascendant> I classify it as a "Python clone".
<HyperProgrammingLugia> 02XD
<Ascendant> Python is good, though.
<drfsupercenter> 03physics exam time...
<Creideiki> Fortran is easy actually.

<HyperProgrammingLugia> 02Byez
<Ascendant> They're just massive ports for cables
<Ray> 02O3o?
<Creideiki> Also, I am looking for two specific plugs actually.
<Sneas> 03Damn it
<Creideiki> (Which I need just two... each costs $15.80. *grumble*)
*Sneas trying te program a remote to work with a different TV
<Ascendant> That's a reasonable price for an Amphenol connector, you know.
<Creideiki> (A 14-S9P and a 14-S1P.)
<Ascendant> Although it really depends on the size
<Ascendant> Ah
<Creideiki> The main reason I need them: I own an... ancient dissovled oxygen meter. And no stirrer or way of interfacing it's "data" port to a PC.
<Skylands> 10Hi Ascendant </late>
<Creideiki> Now... I can get a stirrer made easily... I just need a plug (14-S1P). And the data out is essentially a DAC connected to a serial port (i.e. I have the parts for it... save the connector (14-S9P)).
<Ascendant> And you, Skylands.
<Ascendant> Ah, I know what you mean...good luck with it, then.
<Creideiki> Oh... and also I forgot I need a third, which is a 38999 connector.
<Creideiki> (Which is - for some reason that eludes me - the plug for a "ruggedized" wi-fi router.)

<The_Luginator> 02Komrad BlakcWing
*The_Luginator runs
<May> 14<Aurora> I think vegetarianism is stupid <-- it isn't stupid at all. most vegetarians are vegetarians not because of "SAVETHEANIMALS" it mostly because they hate how the slaughter houses work around the world. it isn't nice, and you wouldn't feel to pleased about being a natural meat-eater and thinking about how pigs get killed in the slaughter houses
<May> 14I personally just don't think about it
<May> 14but some people got problems have their heads full of ideas
<Aurora> 6ok
<sally> ugh it's so late
<Aurora> 6 /how/ they slaughter the animals
<Aurora> 6I understand
*sally pokes Lu
<Aurora> 6but for the people who stop eating animals just because they're eating a living thing
<Aurora> 6that's stupid
<DeathMantis> no it isn't the night is still young
<May> 14yes well, people are stupid
<sally> i'm flippn exhausted
<Aero|AFK> lol my French teacher goes on about this kind of stuff everytime I have French class
<Sheenacrow> Yeah, that's stupid
<May> 14lol
<The_Luginator> 02She does?
<DeathMantis> :/ mebe u should sleep then
<May> 14it is stupid, I agree
<May> 14but people just got problems
<May> 14with nearly everything
<Sheenacrow> It depends on why you're a vegetarian, really o3o
<Aurora> 6we are natural omnivores, so it's technically going against nature to NOT eat meat
<Aurora> 6what sheena said
<The_Luginator> 02:o
<Sheenacrow> Aurora, Anita made that point
<sally> i would like to but i have to clean and shower and do hwk
<Aero|AFK> She says that animals have nerve systems and feel, think, and stuff like we do and that eating animals is cruel. Or something like that O:
*Light_Latias lols
<Aurora> 6anita?
<drf> 03SIGH
<Light_Latias> 12nature clashes with human "morals"
<May> 14well
<The_Luginator> 02?.?
<drfsupercenter> 03God I hate this
<May> 14honestly, I-- drf
<May> 14lol
<Light_Latias> 12which we ourselves made
<Sheenacrow> You wouldn't go up to a tiger and be like, "eating animals is cruel stop D: "
<Light_Latias> 12wb drf
<Aurora> 6lol
<Aero|AFK> lolyeah XD
<The_Luginator> 02The movie is making it slow and disconnect!
<Aurora> 6in my mind, we've been hunter/gatherers for ages
<May> 14Sheena, don't be doing that to me lol
<Aero|AFK> She also hates how animals are being slaughtered though
<Aurora> 6sorry, I'm not stopping that lol
<May> 14it does go against our nature, yeah
<Sheenacrow> I know
<Light_Latias> 12Roara
<Aurora> 6although
<Aero|AFK> but she gets all rant-y and scary at times eAe
<Aurora> 6I do have this to say about those who think slaughtering is cruel
<May> 14but it's cruel to hang a pig upside down and suddenly slash its stomach wide open and let it bleed out
<Aurora> 6HOW ELSE DO YOU GET THE MEAT LOL

<Ray> 02MAAAAAAAAAATHHH <3
<Espeon> o.o;
<Kipikipo> :P
*Umbreon licks Espeon
<Kipikipo> Art History if my current favorite class.
<Kyu> 07that sounds boring o.o
<Kipikipo> I think it's interesting. 'w' The professor is funny 'n' quirky too, so that helps.
*Espeon murrs o.o
<Kipikipo> Besides the art, we also go over how religion had an impact on the art at the time
*Umbreon blush
<Ray> 02yeah Good Class + Good Profesor = GREAT!
<Kipikipo> Like during the Protestant Reformation, "Greenwood" made an altarpiece specifically to annoy the protestants because they were calling Catholics idol-worshippers. He drew God dressed as the Pope, Mary as a Queen
<Espeon> No need to blush, it's a natural reaction ;)
<Espeon> x3
<Umbreon> 12it is?
<Espeon> The murr part~
<Ray> 02LOL
<Kipikipo> It's a really good painting too

<Ray> 02D:
<Kyu> 07lol u
<Kipikipo> That right there is a triptych though so it can open and close in on itself. When it closes, the people who commissioned it can be seeing kneeling before statues- which again, was meant to annoy the Protestants.
<Ray> 02i try'd at least :3
<Kipikipo> Oh, that's another sort of interesting thing about art done in the Renaissance. XD 99% of the time, when someone commissions a picture to be donated to the church, said donners are usually put into the picture and they're usually shown at the Crucifixion.

<HyperMetalLugia> 02That is it..
<Chimera> Lawl
<HyperMetalLugia> 02When A Nintendo Console has Sega games
<Chimera> ...
<HyperMetalLugia> 02And they will not be judged by the quality of the rendering, but the quailty of the games themselfs...
<Chimera> Gamecube- Sonic Adventures DX and Battle 2
<HyperMetalLugia> 02That was *HIS* dream...
*HyperMetalLugia runs
<Chimera> Wii- SatSR, SatBK, Unleashed, Colors, 4
<Ray> 02DREAMCAST + Original SA2 = EPIC FREAKING WIN!
<Chimera> Yes
<HyperMetalLugia> 02NAH SA2B is bettah
<Chimera> VMU editor ftw
*Chimera flees
<HyperMetalLugia> 02It has moar Polygons, and is better for multiplayer!
<Chimera> Lol
<Ray> 02<HyperMetalLugia> NAH SA2B is bettah <--- NEVER, I MEAN NEVER INSULT ORIGINALS AGAIN...
<Chimera> Polygons don't matter
<Chimera> Look at Brawl
<HyperMetalLugia> 02But that's NOT a port!
<Chimera> Its polygons are less than Sonic Unleashed
<HyperMetalLugia> 02I'm comparing one version to another
<Chimera> But its graphics are amazing
<Chimera> So polygon count doesn't matter
<Ray> 02yep, you got that one right chimera :3
<Chimera> Unless it's horribly low
<Chimera> Then you got a problem :P
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Well it's still better on the Gamecube
<Chimera> Whatever

<Ray> 02would you like to sonic team to grab all Classic sonic games, and then make TONS AND TONS of worthless remakes?
<HyperMetalLugia> 02No
<Ray> 02well that's how the original SA2 gamers feel
<Ray> 02and you are not helping
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Okay admit the GC version of SA1 is better

<Ray> 02just for a multiplayer?
<Ray> 02and for slighter better grafics?
<Ray> 02Random Worthless remake (for the ones who played the original) is worthless
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Well, I never owned the Orgional, but after playing through BOTH versions of SA2 (SA2B Disk, SA2 ISO), I still think the GC is better in it's own ways... End of Discussion Round
<Ray> 02OBJECTION!
<HyperMetalLugia> 02-Please post your final comments and change-
<Chimera> Ray
<Ray> 02ugh well, i give up to try to defend a classic game
<Chimera> What about the fact the Dreamcast is discontinued?
<Chimera> And has no support anymore?
<Ray> 02yeah, that makes the game even better
<Ray> 02that's the bad
<Chimera> ...not really
<Ray> 02thingy
<Ray> 02but find one of those games in this time
<Chimera> If they didn't make the GC versions
<Chimera> They'd have to buy off of e-bay
<Ray> 02I wont be cheap (for colletionists)
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Barely anybody would have it
<Chimera> And that's not really fair :|
<Chimera> Exactly
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Without Pirating
<Chimera> HML is right on this one
<Ray> 02well, he got that one
<Ray> 02but, lets remenber that old times, where THAT was inovating... making a remake just destroys the magic of the original game
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Well.. Super Mario All Stars is still a exception
<HyperMetalLugia> 02It has all 4 Mario NES games on 1 cartridge
<HyperMetalLugia> 02All having significant (at the time) upgrades all around
<Ray> 02SNES?*
<HyperMetalLugia> 02*NES
<HyperMetalLugia> 02The All Stars Collection for SNES...?
<Ray> 02oh rly, i thinked that was for th-----WAIT that was for SNES...
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Yeah, I got it in my Suitcase of SNESTUFFS
<HyperMetalLugia> 02But the battery is failing on me
<HyperMetalLugia> 02:(
<Ray> 02But anyway, there IS HOPE of a SA3 game...
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Could it be... Colours...?
<Ray> 02HECK NO!
<Chimera> ...
<Chimera> SA3
<Chimera> I would like that
<Chimera> But eh
<HyperMetalLugia> 02I doubt that they'll ever make another SA game, and I hope they don't
<Chimera> Actually
<Chimera> Unleashed was supposed to be SA3
<Chimera> Aka Sonic World Adventre
<Chimera> *Adventure
<Chimera> :P
<Ray> 02sadly, most of the people now, think that the only thing that CAN save sonic, is that game
<HyperMetalLugia> 02And sonic 4...
<Ray> 02AND sonic 4 your right HML
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Comparsion - Windows 7 is Colours While Unleased is like Vista
<Ray> 02TOTALY AGREE WITH THAT!
<Chimera> La
<Chimera> *Lawl
<Chimera> Yeah
<Chimera> That's actually true
<Chimera> Sonic Unleashed was a beta that was alright but iffy
<Chimera> Colors is improving on that engine
*Chimera has a baaaaad snack craving >>

*Creideiki returns laughing uncontrollably - "Most. Epic. Boss music. Ever!"
<Armageddon> I'm on 113 channels, across 18 networks. I have 11 olines, 24 owners, 43 admins, 56 ops, 4 halfops, and 20 voices. I have abusive power over 407 people.
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02What was the song?
<Armageddon> 02xD
<Creideiki> Well, I'll set up the thing first. I was finishing yet another mod for Deus Ex. Which - prior to the final boss - has an elevator ride where you get to see a nice skyline of future Tokyo.
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02LOL
<Creideiki> And well the music in the cinematic started and I went: "Hey I've heard this before..."
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02And..?
<Creideiki> And then I realized: "Holy <bleep> it's the theme from the Rocky movies! EPIC!"
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02EPIC WIN FTW
*HyperWhovianLugia wants that playing every time he walks home
<Creideiki> Unfortunately, the final boss was /not/ as epic as the soundtrack suggested.
*HyperWhovianLugia plays a collection of random videos made by him
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02That's a letdown...
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02But you did beat the game!
<LaptopAristeo> Yay mechanics \o/
<Creideiki> "This is gonna be sweet. There's gonna be a giant robot. Or several giant robots. And people with machine guns and all that awesome stuff." *bing* "Let's see the aweso-- dude. It's a dude with a pistol. Oh wait, he probably has uber health, let's go!" *thump* *rocket goes whoosh* *BLAM* "...or not. EPIC FAIL!"
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02Wow, it is almost 1am...
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02FAIL BOSS

<Armageddon> 02ohai Dakurai
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02Just like that evil cake in Portal...
<Darkrai07939> Hi
<Creideiki> Not really. This mod was strange. "Ooh, what's this mission, cool we're in Russia we're... invading a commune of hippies?"
<Armageddon> 02:3
<Creideiki> (At least that part was hilarious.)
<Creideiki> (As it absued the "drug" effects of the game. :P )
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02XD
<Creideiki> *runs into a hazy room* "IT'S TIME TO KICK-- Dude... like... crunchy music dude... DUDE! My hands are HUGE!" :P
*HyperWhovianLugia found BROCOLLI in his drink...!
<LaptopAristeo> Stryker :D
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02It's the Non-Deadly Neurotoxin!
<Creideiki> Then there was the mission involving blowing up a brewery.
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02Did you steal some drinks?
*Light_Latias plays Terra's story on Critical Mode @-@
<Creideiki> Yes. One of the things you can get in the base game is lots of beer, whiskey, and wine. I ended up filling my inventory with beer. :P (Which happens to restore player health so awesome.)
<Creideiki> (Only problem... if you drink all thirty you can carry at a time. Welcome to drunk for five minutes. :P )
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02I was going to ask that :p
<Roara|Streaming> finally

*YpeMalUgia goes and fetches his "Repair Kit"
*YpeMalUgia dips his head into a bucket of oily substances
*LoopyDood is taking his friend paintballing for the first time
<LoopyDood> FINALLY he decides he wants to come with me
<Stitch> LoopyDood, give him this advice from me: Don't stop pulling the trigger!
<Armageddon> 02o-o
<Stitch> Seriously. My first time paintballing, I tried to be accurate and not use up a lot.
<Stitch> I sucked.
*Creideiki sics some 23rd century Starfleet engineers on Hyper - "Go my minions... repair! Or you go on security duty."
<Stitch> Then, I decided to go Rambo, and I got 2 people out the first round.
<LoopyDood> I'll give him my own advice: DAMMIT, you've only got 500 paintballs to last the whole 8 hours, STOP SHOOTING
<Stitch> 8 hours? D:
*YpeMalUgia takes his shiny and slippery head out of the bucket
<LoopyDood> Haha
<Stitch> I was there for probably an hour and a half.
<LoopyDood> How long did you play for?
<LoopyDood> How much did that cost you?
*Stitch shrugs.
<Stitch> Dad paid.
<Stitch> What could possibly last 8 hours? D:
<YpeMalUgia> 02Re u in el me?
<Stitch> Search and Destroy with..50 people? D:
<LoopyDood> Dozens of games
<Stitch> Ah.
<LoopyDood> Field's open from 10am to 6pm, I'm there the whole day every weekend
<Stitch> But yeah, first time, I tried to be as accurate as possible.
<YpeMalUgia> 02:p
<Stitch> I took aim (I had one of the guns that actually had a sight), and fired once.
<Stitch> Hit nobody.
<LoopyDood> Here's a tip: get closer
<Stitch> But then we moved to the inflatable course.
*YpeMalUgia bangs his jaw against a wall
<Stitch> My favorite.
<Umbreon> 12why do i get a bad feeling about this?
<Stitch> I would hide behind the very first one, and peek out the sides.
<YpeMalUgia> 02Hmmm?
<YpeMalUgia> 02hut ould e o ad?
<Stitch> If I saw someone, it was firefirefirefirefirefirefirefirefireohsnapthey'realreadyout.
<Umbreon> 12what are you saying
*YpeMalUgia continues hitting the wall
<Umbreon> 12please use english -.-
<YpeMalUgia> 02-What could be so bad?-
<LoopyDood> Haha
<Stitch> I was just glad I had a few re-filling tubes strapped around my waist.
<LoopyDood> Pods?
<Stitch> 'Coz my hopper ran out.
*Stitch shrugs.
<Stitch> Dunno the term.
<Stitch> I just had a fanny-pack-like thing that held four tubes full of paintballs.
<LoopyDood> Look at how many paintballs this holds: http://i348.photobucket.com/albums/q330/loopydood_photos/IMG_4685.jpg?t=1286596798
<LoopyDood> That's what I use
<Stitch> I run out, I pull one of them out, pop the lids, pour them in, and fire again.
<LoopyDood> Basically it means I'm always trying to get closer or around them to get a better shot.
<Stitch> ...10? D:
<LoopyDood> 15 at the most
<EpicStatsGuy> [10:39] <%Aurora> I kick/kill for the enjoyment
<YpeMalUgia> 02Wb Lyon
<Lyon> 04ty
<LoopyDood> I usually end up getting two or three eliminations per game
<YpeMalUgia> 02- I need some assistance, my jaw and tounge has become stuck-
<Stitch> We actually played 'president' once; a game where one person was the president, and the others had to cover him and get him to the other side without him dying. A game involving a lot of running, which makes me sick.
<Stitch> Guess who was the president.
<LoopyDood> But that's playing 5ish people on each team in an urban field
<LoopyDood> Haha
<LoopyDood> We sometimes do games like that
<Umbreon> 12wheee wild Drake is back, wb
<Drake> 04ty
<LoopyDood> But, the other way aroun
<LoopyDood> d
<Stitch> My dad stuck with me, and I was sick halfway across the field.
<LoopyDood> One person's the hostage
<Umbreon> 12how goes
<LoopyDood> He starts with the terrorist team
*YpeMalUgia hits his head against the wall so hard, that it falls off!
<LoopyDood> And he has to escape
<LoopyDood> If he's shot, terrorists win
<LoopyDood> The terrorists have to get to the other side of the field with him
<LoopyDood> CTs have to touch him to win
<Stitch> Oh, boy. XD
*where has always wanted to do paintball D:
*eXAKR slaps YpeMalUgia around a bit with an iPhone 4G
<LaptopAristeo> Wait
<LoopyDood> That's a fun game to watch
<Stitch> But anyway, my hopper actually fell out while I was running.
<LoopyDood> Haha, tighten your feedneck :P
<LaptopAristeo> Why not shoot the hostage straight away?
<YpeMalUgia> 02At least I can talk properly now!
*where pëw pëws LaptopAristeo
<where> :o
<LoopyDood> LaptopAristeo: They lose, then
<LaptopAristeo> :o
*LaptopAristeo confused
<LoopyDood> It's to stop the CTs from shooting the hostage
<LaptopAristeo> Oh
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02But I seem to have a disconnection
<LaptopAristeo> So, whoever shoots the hostage, the other team wins?
<LoopyDood> Wait, never mind, it was actually a tie game
<LaptopAristeo> oh
<LoopyDood> Usually someone would grab the hostage and use him as a human shield
<LoopyDood> If he gets shot, the hostage would make a run for it
<LoopyDood> Then every single terrorist would start shooting at him
<HyperWhovianLugia> 02So, if you could kindly climb up me (and not get imapaled) and reattach my head?
<Stitch> My dad gave me his gun and ran out to get it, and we actually ended up winning. I was about to throw up by the time I got to the other side of the field.
<Stitch> The other team
<Stitch> Erm.
<LoopyDood> Stitch: Running makes you sick?
<Stitch> The other team's president hadn't moved.
<Stitch> LoopyDood, very much so.
<LoopyDood> That sucks.
<LoopyDood> I'm constantly running when I play, I need to be :P
<Soyuz> Drake; and I need help
<Drake> 04?
<LoopyDood> I mean like, dead sprint the entire time I'm not shooting at someone.

<Stryker> Buuuuut?
<Stryker> D:

<Stryker> Oh
<Stryker> Australia?
<where> Mmmhmmm
<Stryker> D:
*Stryker drags where to the US.
<where> D:

<Curly> you should have payed someone to gift you from somewhere else :O
<Stryker> But yeah. We should play L4D1 some time. :3
<where> I was thinking of that
<Stryker> I was going to buy an extra copy. >.>;
<where> But does it work?
<Curly> yes
<where> :/
<Curly> and if you gift someone you give them the censored version too
<Stryker> Nasty.
<Curly> so it works both ways
<Stryker> Horrible, horrible present.
<where> I read about changing your IP to look like an american one, and buying the game
<where> Which works for some people
<Spyrorocks`> probably not
<where> But it wouldn't go through D:
<Spyrorocks`> because your account says your location :P
<Spyrorocks`> when you sign up.
<where> It apparently only checks the country/city/state/postcode bit when you buy a game
<where> Apparently works, but not for me.

<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Infact I should really play the campaigh on Halo 3
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> It is now drf, but back in the day of the original Xbox Halo was by far the best game on the console
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Halo: Reach is dreadful
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Halo 3 was the last 'good' one
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> ODST was kinda meh
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Though I love the magnum on ODST

<Lyon> 04LOL
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> XD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03bedtime
<Lyon> 04blah
<Lyon> 04I want to play that Mausoleum fight in Halo 2 again :<
<Lyon> 04it was epic
<Lyon> 04but it takes so long to get too and it's too quick
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> lol
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I would play it, but my Halo 2 disc is damaged :<
<Lyon> 04:<
<Lyon> 04that SUCKS
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Yeah, it's the limited edition disc too :(
<Lyon> 04D:
<Lyon> 04me and a friend were playing on Heroic last night
<Lyon> 04I had a Beam Rifle (I was the sniper) and a Fuel Rod Cannon, he had a Sword and I think a Needler
<Lyon> 04needless to say
<Lyon> 04it took a while to kill those damn Hunters
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Funnily enough Hunters are easy to kill if your accuracy is perfect
<Lyon> 04I just walked up behind those Ultras, like I always do, and whack them in the back before hitting them with a Fuel Rod shot
<Lyon> 04yeah, I don't have perfect accuracy
<Lyon> 04but playing Sniper is fun :D
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> They have an open spot on there necks
<Lyon> 04ah
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> One shot to that with Battle Rifle, Carbine, Beam Rifle or Sniper Rifle = instant kill :3
<Lyon> 04oh, and I saw the Honour Guard Councillor for the first time last night
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> lol Honour Guards
<Lyon> 04Honour Guards are pushovers tbh
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> One's with Swords on Legendary are a pain in the ass
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> They don't know how to die >>
<Lyon> 04lol
<Lyon> 04btw, is it even possible to kill Regret without boarding his floating chair and meleeing him?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I pummeled one with 4 Beam Rifle shots to the head, still lived :<
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Yes
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Takes a lot of ammo though
<Lyon> 04I tried to do it without boarding, because it makes it too easy, and I could NOT kill him
<Lyon> 04:\
<Lyon> 04Normal difficulty as well
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Preferably dual wielding Needlers work best
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 8 clips of needlers should do the trick
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> if you're playing legendary though, you HAVE to board kill him
<Lyon> 04that sucks
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Tartarus is worse
<Lyon> 04it'd be a nice challenge to kill him without that on Legen-
<Lyon> 04FFFFF
<Lyon> 04don't get me STARTED on him
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> You have to take his shield off yourself on Legendary
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> That's a b*tch
<Lyon> 04so I've heard
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> especially when you can't find decent plasma weapons
<Lyon> 04I figured I could just grab a Beam Rifle, since I'm a better Sniper than any of my friends, while the other gets dual Brute Plasma Rifles
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I suggest Dual Brute Plasma for the shield, then a sword for the kill
<Lyon> 04yeah
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Snipers don't do much
<Lyon> 04two lunges to his back kills him
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Not on legendary anyway
<Lyon> 04if you get 3 shots to his head in a row with the Beam rifle works
<Lyon> 04I saw it work, and not by Johnson
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Johnson doesn't help at all on Legendary :<
<Lyon> 04I know
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> In fact only a Co-op player can be of any use
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Tis rather annoying doing all the work alone though XD
<Lyon> 04lol
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I did have fun with a Brute Shot and a Shotgun though
<Lyon> 04Brute Shpt <3
<Lyon> 04Shot*
<Lyon> 04epic melee
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Shotgun had 7 shells left
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Brute Shot had 1
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Bring it tartarus 8D
<Lyon> 04XD
<Lyon> 04me and my friend often both get brute shots, then just go on a melee rampage together against Brutes
<Lyon> 04less effective on higher difficulties but it works :3
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> XD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Plasma Pistol VS Tartarus = PAIN

<Soyuz> "MDATA.001 is a unknown path ti video manager"
*HyperMetalLugia runs
<Blazaking> so go find it
<Roleplay4life> 5...Yeah... um... I beg to differ.
<Soyuz> I know where it is
<Soyuz> in the MDATA folder
<Soyuz> problem is that the videomanager doesnt know what it is
<Blazaking> k
<Soyuz> or in some sense of that
<Blazaking> So where does it think it is?
<Soyuz> I've never heard of the problem before

*LaptopAristeo holds Stryker
<Kitten> i'm pregnant!
<DoomCricket> uhwhaa?
<LaptopAristeo> Yay, congratulations Kitten!
<DoomCricket> when did this happen?
<DoomCricket> and i can't remember how old kitten is
<LaptopAristeo> 17 :3
*Kitten giggles
<DoomCricket> nikki says congrats
<Kitten> lol
<DoomCricket> and i second that sentiment
<Kitten> i'm kidding, i'm not pregnant.. yet
<LaptopAristeo> xD
<DoomCricket> :o
<Kitten> i'm going to have a baby on November 12, 2013
<DoomCricket> nikki thinks that wasn't funny
<LaptopAristeo> Hmm
*LaptopAristeo has all kinds of questions
<Stryker> The world'll be over by then, though.
<DoomCricket> i'm laughing so hard and i'm sooo thankful she can't kick me XD
<DoomCricket> if she could she'd be kicking me repeatedly
*LaptopAristeo wonders why Kitten wants to have a baby on that exact date
<Kitten> because!
<DoomCricket> randomness?
<LaptopAristeo> Hmmm
<DoomCricket> great now she wants a beer
*LaptopAristeo has a guess
<Kitten> i think it'd be cool to have a baby at 9:10am on the date 11-12-13
<DoomCricket> lol that would be
<LaptopAristeo> Ohhhhhhh
<Kitten> so i'm going to try..
<DoomCricket> thanks Kitten you just helped me dodge a bullet
<DoomCricket> you distracted her
<LaptopAristeo> Kitten: Why not on 11:11:11 11/11/11?
<DoomCricket> lmao that would be cool too
<Kitten> how'd i do that?
<LaptopAristeo> ooooooh, or, 06:07:08 09/10/11
<Kitten> and Ari because! i'd only be 19.. and well 11/11/11 is so cliche
<LaptopAristeo> 06:07:08 09/10/11 <--- not cliche
<Kitten> i'd only be 18 at that date Ari!
<DoomCricket> you distracted her with the baby birthdate thing long enough for me to get out of reach of her good arm
<LaptopAristeo> Oh
<DoomCricket> :D
<LaptopAristeo> Kitten: How old do you want to be?
<Kitten> mine i'd be 21
<Kitten> i dunno.. but not 18..
<LaptopAristeo> okies
*DoomCricket grabs the shovel of doom
<LaptopAristeo> And so we have to find you a boyfriend in time too
*DoomCricket digs a hole and buries things in it
<DoomCricket> :P
<LaptopAristeo> Things! Perfect!
<LaptopAristeo> Things: Would you like to be a father?
<Things> :o
<LaptopAristeo> Things: Just do everything Kitten tells you to do
<Things> Erm, probably not quite yet :3
<DoomCricket> oi! i just planted him
*Kitten turns bright red
<LaptopAristeo> Too late, we already formed a committee
<DoomCricket> i;'m waiting to see if he grows into a burrito tree
<Kitten> no not yet Things.. i'm waiting atleast 2 years..
*DoomCricket fluffles Kitten
<LaptopAristeo> Perfect, okay then, it's settled :3
<DoomCricket> chris you're next
<LaptopAristeo> Kitten: What are you going to name him/her? :o
<DoomCricket> decide where i'm planting you
*LaptopAristeo thinks Kitten is really good at naming :3
<DoomCricket> i'm going for a spaghetti taco tree this time
<LaptopAristeo> I want to be a candy tree :3
<Kitten> if its a Him.. i have no idea.. if its a her then i'm going to name her either Mercy Raine, or Miyuki Sun
<DoomCricket> nope! i want a spaghtetti taco tree
<LaptopAristeo> ooooooooh, pretty :3
*LaptopAristeo likes Miyuki Sun
<DoomCricket> nice names ^_^
<Kitten> thank you!
*DoomCricket digs a hole behind the channel outhouse and plants LaptopAristeo
<Kitten> oh if Things decides not to be the father between now and time then I nominate Stitch!
<DoomCricket> lotsa fertilizer there for growing a good spaghetti taco tree
<LaptopAristeo> If it's a boy, you should name him Mark Antony or Prometheus
*DoomCricket thinks LaptopAristeo reads too many old books :P
<LaptopAristeo> Stitch is closer, that would work better
<DoomCricket> imma brb getting nikki munchies b4 she eats all of mine
<LaptopAristeo> kk
<LaptopAristeo> Prometheus is a cool name
<Kitten> nooooo
<LaptopAristeo> Prometheus was the guy who stole fire from the gods and gave it to the humans :3
<LaptopAristeo> That's like the most gutsy thing you could do :3
<Alejandro> And he failed and got caught.
<Alejandro> Lame.
<DoomCricket> no the most gutsy thing you could do is steal something from chuck norriss
<DoomCricket> *norris
<LaptopAristeo> ..... Mark Antony almost re-conquered the Roman Republic during its transition into the Roman Empire?
<DoomCricket> nikki corrected me -_-
<LaptopAristeo> ....... Octavian beat Antony though
<Alejandro> Almost!
<Alejandro> Still fail.
<LaptopAristeo> Alejandro: Octavian win?
<Alejandro> Sure.
<DoomCricket> chuck norris defeats all
<Alejandro> I'm too sleep deprived to know who I'm bashing.
<DoomCricket> crap she jacked my coke ;-;
<DoomCricket> who is Alejandro?
<DoomCricket> another new user?
<LaptopAristeo> I always pictured Octavian as kind of a nerdy guy though
<Kitten> i think if its a boy i'll name him Akira Kain or Nailo James
<DoomCricket> or not lol
<DoomCricket> cool names too :)
*DoomCricket bumps tatu
<LaptopAristeo> I always pictured Octavian as this sadistic, twisted, nerdy guy, and Mark Anthony as this big brute of a man
<LaptopAristeo> Kitten: Nice names :)
<LaptopAristeo> I think Kitten would be a good mother
<DoomCricket> i second that
<LaptopAristeo> Alright, the motion is on the table
*Kitten blushes
<Kitten> oh Ari! did i tell you i proposed to someone the other day?
<DoomCricket> nikki wanted to vote until i pointed out she doesn't know Kitten
<DoomCricket> cool :)
<LaptopAristeo> DoomCricket: Does the lady wish to call the question
<DarkTruth> Andres :D
<DarkTruth> hey there
<Andres> Hai! :D
<LaptopAristeo> Kitten: ooooooo, nope!
<Kitten> yep!
*Andres hugtackles LightLie! <3
<LaptopAristeo> Cool!
*DarkTruth huggles
<DoomCricket> no she's busy trying to steal my pickle before i eat it even tho she has 3 of her own
<DoomCricket> :S
<LaptopAristeo> hmm
<DoomCricket> lol i think she MY munchies and hers
<Kitten> is she preggers?
<DoomCricket> that got a wicked smile. my stomach is doomed :/
<DoomCricket> nope
<Kitten> you know you should get her ice cream
<LaptopAristeo> Looks like she's the perfect girl for you DoomCricket!
*LaptopAristeo nudges them together
<DoomCricket> just recovering from her ex bf beating her up and throwing her down a flight of stairs
*Kitten smacks DoomCricket
<Kitten> get her ice cream then
<DoomCricket> chris her and i decided that us dating was too weird. we've been inseperable since preschool
<DoomCricket> she already ate it all
<Kitten> get her more.
<DoomCricket> last night
<LaptopAristeo> Well get her some more!
<DoomCricket> i'm out
*LaptopAristeo high-fives Kitten
<Kitten> buy some!
*Kitten giggles
<DoomCricket> and she ate my entire cake i made earlier. i didn't even get a crumb ;-;
<Kitten> so?! she's hurt
<DoomCricket> i think i made the mistake of promising to share it
<Kitten> eatting makes ppl feel better when they're hurting
<Kitten> so go get her ice cream or i'll kick you too
<Kitten> and i'll use my lovely new steal toed boots
*LaptopAristeo smiles
<DoomCricket> lol she's content with my pickles. i gave in and just gave them to her, she was gonna end up with them anyways
<Kitten> ice cream is better
<DoomCricket> lol
<DoomCricket> she's shaking her head
<Kitten> ohhh! get her mint chocolate chip ice cream and pretzels..
<DoomCricket> pickles are her favorite food
<Kitten> they compliment eachother very well
<Kitten> then by her pickle ice cream
<DoomCricket> they make that?!?!?!?!?!
<Kitten> and yes, they make that
<DoomCricket> :o
*DoomCricket has never come across it
<DoomCricket> i've had fish flavored ice cream before tho
<DoomCricket> i didn't like it so i gave it to nikki and she went back for 4 more helpings
<DoomCricket> eeeew
<Kitten> there's a ice cream shop.. can't remember the name of it for the life of me atm though, thats in chicago that cells pickle ice cream
<Kitten> sells*
<DoomCricket> she devours that stuff every chance she gets lol
<DoomCricket> hahaha i'm emperor of the pickles
<DoomCricket> i gots the jar
<DoomCricket> let's see how long that lasts tho
<DoomCricket> she just jacked my beer ;-;
<DoomCricket> she's even worse than me today when it comes to being a human garbage disposal
<DoomCricket> she's eating her food and anyone else's she can get her hands on
<DoomCricket> and she weighs 50 pounds less than me
<DoomCricket> i take that back. 45 pounds less than me
<DoomCricket> lmao distraction isn't effective on just small children, it works quite well on nikki too
<DoomCricket> i got her attention with a bag of peppermint sticks
<DoomCricket> she's busy with that, so maybe i can finally eat a pickle without it being snatched before my second bite
<DoomCricket> she wants another cig now, even tho i just carried her out for one not that long ago
<DoomCricket> -_-

<LaptopAristeo> Xeeshu: That would be cool if that happened -- if all of a sudden, we got into a conversation about proper coding conventions and ranting about the lack of information out there regarding parliamentary law
<LaptopAristeo> Andres: You have to talk to girls you don't know in order to have the possibility to go out with them and stuffs
<LaptopAristeo> You can't just pick them up and carry them away most of the time
<Andres> Really? o.o
<Andres> They have looked quite happy afterwards D:
<LaptopAristeo> Yeah, they usually don't like that in the U.S.
*Andres is obviously just being silly though and just usually has crushes on people that just hate him and such ^^

*Xeeshu is scared most of the times talking to girls that he don't know.! But know that my friends said COMM'ON man you are in university OK ? just do whatever you want

<Xeeshu> Scarryy...1!!
<Xeeshu> what if i say something.. and she doesn't like it :O

*Xeeshu has to search this word EXOTIC in detail.
*Xeeshu appoligizes for his weak vocabulary :(
<LaptopAristeo> It's okay
<LaptopAristeo> I might've misspelled it
<Xeeshu> The spelling is right but is this a bad word
<Xeeshu> ?
<LaptopAristeo> no
<Xeeshu> mhm
<Xeeshu> Exotic = alien: being or from or characteristic of another place or part of the world; "alien customs"; "exotic plants in a greenhouse"; "exotic cuisine"
<LaptopAristeo> It means foreign, different, but exciting -- it's always used in a good way
<Xeeshu> Oh!

<Umbreon> 12but to get 2nd place easier she needs to get good resistence

<Chimera> We gave everyone this oxygen stuff
<Chimera> So they could breath underwater
<Chimera> Then we went to a sunken city

<Chimera> :P
<Soyuz> How long do we all last untill we die of pressure?
<Umbreon> 12hmm
<Chimera> Well
<Chimera> The wave came at 10:01 or somethig
<Soyuz> or lack of oxygen
<Chimera> It was LOUD
<Chimera> And everyone kinda flew up and down as the waves came
<Chimera> I almost got completely out of the surface xD
<Soyuz> wouldnt we..
<Soyuz> drown instead?
<Chimera> When we realized that we needed to hold onto something we held hands
<Soyuz> since I dont personally know anyone who can fully break from the pressure and strenght of the waves
<Soyuz> and manage to break out
<Chimera> After 4 or 3 more waves the flood stopped
<Soyuz> lol holding hands can stop anything o3o
<Soyuz> except nuclear holocausts
<Chimera> True xD
<Chimera> But yeah
<Chimera> That's wat happened
<Chimera> i was heroah

<Kjakings> 7go, cry about your shame
<Irene> 07Espeon
<Irene> 07its so silly
<Irene> 07one of the differences between chat and rl
<Irene> 07is the degree
<Irene> 07of
<Irene> 07affection LOL
<Irene> 07sure I'm getting used to you but XP
<Icydragon> 12I do have a life, and a girlfriend, and friends, and a dog named Buddy.
<Espeon> the day internet based chat can offer that sort of thing, that's the day "social life" becomes an ancient term
<Espeon> and I know what you mean
<Icydragon> 12Ah Buddy, I love that dog.
<Kjakings> 7I have no life, but I like it that way
<Kjakings> 7I'm a rather asocial person
<Irene> 07I dont want social life to ever become ancient.
<Icydragon> 12True, when you have no life, you have no worries.
<Irene> 07but yeah o3o
<Irene> 07I mean
<Irene> 07I dunno, I hold onto everyone but I'm seriously afraid of holding onto you for support .-.
<Irene> 07See
<Irene> 07when we're walking somewhere
<Irene> 07I ALWAYS
<Irene> 07worry
<WarriorCatzFan56> MY SIS IS GETTING ON BYE

<Espeon> You seem to do well at that though :P
<Chimera> Hiii
<Irene> 07then again I'm a bit nervous to ask if I can hold onto your arm ^^; I do with most of my friends here but its just you
<Chimera> Irene :3
<Irene> 07Espeon I try really hard but
*Chimera glomps
<Irene> 07It's challenging and very tiring
<Irene> 07after we've been out for a few hours I'm always exhausted
<Irene> 07Chimera!!!!!!!!!
*Irene huggles Chimera loads
<Chimera> :>
<CarrieL877> i dont think anyone is here
*Chimera happeh kitteh
<Espeon> o.o; no need to be nervous ^^
<Irene> 07You sure..?
<Icydragon> 12Hey.
<Irene> 07I just dont want to intrude on your personal space
<Icydragon> 12"CarrieL877"
<CarrieL877> um hi...
<CarrieL877> Yes?
<Icydragon> 12Nothing dear...
<Espeon> holding onto my arm isn't intruding my personal space :P
<CarrieL877> -_- dont call me "dear"...
<Espeon> I mean, if it was just the first time we met like *GRAB* then it would be o-O wut but
<Irene> 07lolol
<Irene> 07well okay ^^
<Irene> 07You might've noticed I sometimes lightly brush you or something
<Irene> 07all that
<Icydragon> 12*touches*
<Irene> 07is just so I can orient myself
<CarrieL877> *slaps*
<Irene> 07I manage fairly well, but even if you walk on one side, then switch, can be confusing XD
<Irene> 07takes a few for it to register in my mind
<Icydragon> 12Never said you! D:<
<Espeon> I see, never really thought of it like that though ^^
<Irene> 07Meeps
<Irene> 07I've honestly been afraid of bringing it up
<Irene> 07always hesitated because
<Irene> 07I don't want to come across as silly/clingy/weird LOL
<Espeon> Listen
<Espeon> I'm not even ALLOWED to call people weird because that would make me a hypocrite... in a way
*Espeon dies
<Irene> 07well most people aren't you .-.
<Irene> 07I've gotten some weird responses
<Irene> 07to the disability and holding onto people for support
<Irene> 07MOST people are OK with it
<Irene> 07but
<Irene> 07not everyone
<Irene> 07anyway like

<Icydragon> 12Holy shit! Dari is Thor?!
<Kjakings> 7The Asgard, not the god
<Kjakings> 7the Asgard being an alien race in this context
<Icydragon> 12Oh I see.
<Kjakings> 7the egg came first btw
<Soyuz> *5 boxes
<Soyuz> and the serial key inside the folder, only has 4
<Icydragon> 12No, two parent are needed to make an egg.
<Icydragon> 12Unless it's asexual
<Umbreon> 12guess
<Kjakings> 7hold on, this is a bitch to describe. I'll c/p my answer from a paradox thread I made
<Kjakings> 7"evolution provides us with the answer: the creature we consider 'chicken' was obviously hatched out of an egg by its evolutionary ancestor divergant enough to NOT be considered 'chicken.' Therefore, the egg was first."
<Prince-dari> I concur. Egg first.
<Icydragon> 12Put where did the egg come from?
<Prince-dari> Two just-not-chicken-chickens.
<Kjakings> 7... it says that, in my answer
<Kjakings> 7read it again
<Icydragon> 12Oh I see now.
<Kjakings> 7it came from the chicken's evolutionary ancestor, we'll call them pre-chickens
<Icydragon> 12From a single-celled organism perhaps....
<Kjakings> 7I intend to raise this subject in one of my classes tommorow and spend the two hour double lesson debating this instead of what we're supposed to be doing
<Kjakings> 7OH shit. I forgot my history homework
<Icydragon> 12Homework is pointless in my school, as long as you write down something, you get credit.

<Drake> 04'
<Drake> 04'course, all adults say that*
<Armageddon> 02XD
<Armageddon> 02you do have talent
<Drake> 04my uncle even wants me to design tatoos for him o-o
<Drake> 04lol you think so?
<Armageddon> 02tbqh I could go into a philosophical rant
<Drake> 04she thinks I should be a game designer
<Armageddon> 02but barring that
<Drake> 04...
<Drake> 04lol
<Armageddon> 02you are pretty good
<Armageddon> 02game designer?
<Drake> 04yeah
<Armageddon> 02not bad
<Drake> 04that's what she called it
<Armageddon> 02you'd probably do better as an animation artist
<Drake> 04of course, I only put effort into things I WANT to do
<Drake> 04lol
<Drake> 04I fail at animation
<Drake> 04fast animations at least
<Armageddon> 02XD
<Drake> 04ok
<Drake> 04first it was an author, then a programmer, then a video game soundtrack composer, now an animation artist/game designer
<Drake> 04what next?
<Armageddon> 02lol who was the one who said you were a programmer?
<Armageddon> 02me?
<Armageddon> 02I don't remember lol

<Drake> 04I'm NOT
<Armageddon> 02oh lol
<Armageddon> 02speaking of computers
<Drake> 04just because I can get a game to work doesn't mean I'm good with PCs >.>

<Armageddon> 02xD
<Armageddon> 02Hey
<Armageddon> 02I don't know a lot about hardware either
<Armageddon> 02Presea is the pr0 on hardware
<Armageddon> 02I'm more into programming and software
<Armageddon> 02not hardware
<Drake> 04well, even the software/programming stuff I'm not so great at
<Armageddon> 02I can make the damn crap work
<Armageddon> 02but tbh I'm not very good at it
<Drake> 04blah
<Drake> 04I should work on my GT assignment
<Drake> 04due tomorrow I THINK

<Armageddon> 02I get lazy too often
<Random_ai> lazy atm
<Drake> 04o-o
<Drake> 04NS, you and I are so damn alike
<Drake> 04we're both HORRIBLE procrastinater's
<Drake> 04procrastinaters*
<Armageddon> 02I already told you
<Armageddon> 02that we're alike
<Drake> 04I know
<Drake> 04and I don't mind it at all
<Drake> 04dunno why you thought I'd be upset about that
<Armageddon> 02except you're probably less of an asshole I am
<Drake> 04tbh I admire you
<Drake> 04lol
<Armageddon> 02both IRL and on the internet
<Drake> 04only because I don't have the courage to be an asshole
<Armageddon> 02and probably less arrogant
<Armageddon> 02XD
<Drake> 04or rather the blatant disregard
<Random_ai> well at the human race is rather complex parser
*Drake hides
<Armageddon> 02XD
<Drake> 04WHY DO YOU KEEP SPEAKING?
<Armageddon> 02the "don't care" approach
<Armageddon> 02it's a script
<Armageddon> 02it's like True_ai
<Drake> 04I know
<Armageddon> 02anna kick Random_ai
<Drake> 04but it's weird
<anna> Armageddon: That sounds very lovely.
<Random_ai> 12welcome15 random_ai is on 27/06/2010

<Armageddon> 02yah
<Armageddon> 02anyway
<Armageddon> 02yeah
<Armageddon> 02most of what I do is because of my "I don't care" approach
<Armageddon> 02dunno whether I do things out of courage or whatnot
<Drake> 04surprisingly, I DO care alot about what people think
<Drake> 04just not what my family thinks
<Armageddon> 02similar to me
<Armageddon> 02very similar in fact
<Armageddon> 02just about the same

<Light_Latias> 12yah
<KuroLink> I'm hoping to get some new games to break this rut
<KuroLink> I've heard great things about super scribblenauts
<Umbreon> 12i like it
<Umbreon> 12sort of
<Umbreon> 12i'm annoyed how it takes me 60 minutes to complete a puzzle that people on average takes 8 minutes to do
<Umbreon> 12lol
<KuroLink> My mind is exploding with ideas to try first
<Presea> heh
<KuroLink> You should look into it LL great for boredom killing
<Light_Latias> 12o3o
<Light_Latias> 12mebbie
<KuroLink> It's cheap, $30
<Light_Latias> 12that's cheap? >_<
<KuroLink> Yea :D
*Light_Latias would rather get Dead Rising 2, tbh o3o
<Light_Latias> 12which is $60 yes
<KuroLink> That costs WAY more
<KuroLink> Twice
<Light_Latias> 12but it's for the 360, which I need more games for o3o
<Light_Latias> 12plus, I get discounts~
<KuroLink> I need more ds games
<KuroLink> But also to save for 3DS
<Light_Latias> 12same
<Light_Latias> 12but
*Light_Latias has like: $500 lol
<KuroLink> Oh lucky
<KuroLink> You can afford 3DS !
<Light_Latias> 12no
<Light_Latias> 12not lucky
<Light_Latias> 12a hard worker v-v
<Quilava> :P
*Light_Latias flees
<KuroLink> I'm going into eBay selling
<KuroLink> And I'm sorry I'm sure you worked very hard for that
<Ray> 02back :3
<Light_Latias> 12lol

<KuroLink> And for that I commend you
<Light_Latias> 12tys o3o
<KuroLink> What color 3DS you getting ?
<Light_Latias> 12Idk, blue?
<Umbreon> 12?
<KuroLink> I'll probably wait for twilight black again
<Quilava> I dunno
<Quilava> I'm not a big fan of solitare games
<Light_Latias> 12Twilight o3o
<KuroLink> Ugh not that one
<Light_Latias> 12yush <3
<KuroLink> that series can go burn
<Umbreon> 12lol
<Umbreon> 12is it really solitare?
<Umbreon> 12its japanese so it must be good D:
<Light_Latias> 12D:
<Light_Latias> 12and
*Light_Latias LOLS!
<Quilava> solitare is a game you play by yourself >.>
<Quilava> so.. yes
<Light_Latias> 12I just broke Ven's hold XD
<Light_Latias> 12and am heading to the winner podium
<Umbreon> 12in my opinion there is no such thing as a true solitare game
<Light_Latias> 12...and rolled a 1 v-v
<Umbreon> 12because you can always have friends there helping you out with advice
<KuroLink> Also I'm now against piracy
<Quilava> then you're cheating
<Light_Latias> 12lolz
<Light_Latias> 12dun let drf hear that o3o
<Umbreon> 12when in the rules does it say getting advice is cheating?
<KuroLink> I intend to buy everything I wish to play
<Umbreon> 12actually come to think about it, it doesn't say in the rulebooks that cheating isn't allowed either
<Ray> 02NOOOOOOOOO
<Ray> 02PIRACY HERE IS A GOD, just like the companion cube
<KuroLink> So Nintendo can get back to real updates
<Light_Latias> 12Companion Cube <3
<Ray> 02here things AAAAAAAAAAARRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEE WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY TOOOOOOOO MUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCH EEEEEEEEEXPENSIVE!
<KuroLink> I'm even reporting some of my old rom sites I used to visit
<Quilava> I thought that was a given
<Light_Latias> 12oh blah
<KuroLink> Piracy is NOT good
<Ray> 02here a normal ds game with the dollar change, is 150$ us FOR JUST ONE GAME, not worth it >_>
<Umbreon> 12lol
<Light_Latias> 12I forgot that poem >_<
<Umbreon> 12if its not in writing you have a good excuse
<Quilava> in that case I can finish any puzzle in 0 seconds... assuming I can start the timer the moment I finish solving the puzzle
<Light_Latias> 12about the Companion Cube
<Quilava> because nobody said its not allowed
<Umbreon> 12exactly
<Ray> 02>_<
<KuroLink> Do we really want Nintendo to keep up with these "updates"
<Light_Latias> 12and nao moar Kingdom Hearts Party~
<KuroLink> I for one want real new features
<Quilava> that's stupid logic :|
<Quilava> thats like the guy yesterday
<Ray> 02yeah you are right Kuro, But understand Here IS WAY TO MUCH EXPENSIVE
<Quilava> who yelled at me for not breaking up a fight
<Quilava> because nobody told him not to start one >.>

<Xeeshu> Word - tazes

<Ray_Kirara> 02or kipi, see my tst profile, my profile pic is kirara~ *made by aurora*
<LizardGirl> that site has all sorts of pervy things
<Xeeshu> Word - Tazer
<Xeeshu> 	*Hypertize*	Definition - A sexual act involving taking the "shocker" (two in the pink, one in the stink) and dual-wielding. It is preformed by taking both hands and doing the "shocker" while your hands are crossed so the backs of your hands are touching. Then the tazer is finished by swiftly alternating hands back and forth while keeping your pinky fingers separated slightly to loosen up a...
<Xeeshu> ...female's sphincter to cause an
<Xeeshu> 	*Hypertize*	electrifying sensation.
<Xeeshu> 	*Hypertize*	Example - So I was about do this chick in the butt last night, but she was a little uncooperative, so I just gave her the tazer to loosen her up instead.
<Xeeshu> LizardGirl: here you go..

<Irene> 07LOL*
<KuroLink> Aurora it is then
<Newberrytiger> 14Doesn't ring any bells. When did you start coming to HoR?
*Sneas is tired because he just woke up from a nap :3
<Soyuz> some months ago..
<Kitten> Stitch did Ari or anyone tell you that you or Things gets to be a father?
<Newberrytiger> 14Haha, I guess I've been away for quite some time...
*Sneas is happy to see Newberry back :3
<Stitch> :O
<Chimera> meew
<Chimera> *mew
<Chimera> I'll still call you floof if you're active, Aurora
<Chimera> XD
<Aurora> 6well yeah
<Sneas> Should try to come here more often ^^
<Aurora> 6if I'm around and active, I'll see it
*Soyuz curls in his corner
<Aurora> 6but I can't respond if it doesn't call up my nick alert
<Chimera> No you won't, your colorblind to floof
<Chimera> :<
*Chimera flees
<Aurora> 6which only happens if you say my current name, but i'm more prone to seeing "roara" than floof
<Aurora> 6if I chack in here and all
<Chimera> yah
<Chimera> So like
<Aurora> 6I'm not a colorblind dog :P
<Chimera> I assume you're on your mac, correct?
<Aurora> 6yep
<Chimera> asdfghjkl
<Aurora> 6because of livestream
<Chimera> k
*LaptopAristeo nods
<Aurora> 6in like 5 minutes
<Chimera> makes sense |3
<Aurora> 6also
<Chimera> ?
<Aurora> 6don't rush me
<Chimera> i'm not |D
<Aurora> 6I have it on reminder now
<Chimera> oh k
<Chimera> :>
<Aurora> 6one of my peeves os being rushed
<Aurora> 6is
<Aurora> 6asdfg
<Newberrytiger> 14Awwh thanks :)
<LaptopAristeo> Stitch: Kitten needs to have a baby within the next few years and needs some help
*Chimera gives you Steven
<KuroLink> Next time don't offer an option you won't respond to
<Aurora> 6all is better now
<Chimera> :3
<Newberrytiger> 14i've missed everyone, but I needed a good break. Not for any particular reason. I just kinda did. You know?
<Aurora> 6what, kuro?
<Aurora> 6I didn't say I wont respond to it >.>
<Newberrytiger> 14Awwh Soyuz, what's wrong?
<Stitch> :o
<KuroLink> Ok I'm confused now
<Aurora> 6I said that if I happen to be idle, when I check in here I'm more often going to notice "roara" than "floof"
<Aurora> 6because floof is used for a lot of things
<Soyuz> alot of stuff tbh
<Aurora> 6but roara is pretty obvious as to what it's referring to
<Sneas> Yeah :<
<Aurora> 6but if I'm active and talking, like right now
<Aurora> 6you can call me floof all you want
<Aurora> 6and I'll assume you're talking to me
<Soyuz> Issues and revolutionary struggle bring a heavy toll
<LaptopAristeo> Stitch: And Kitten can PM you all the details
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(May03)02WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here
<drfsupercenter> 03so, I just spent like $20 on soda
<May> 14wasteful
<drfsupercenter> 03and brought a whole bag full of 20oz's back here
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not my money
<drfsupercenter> 03:)
<Kitten> Ari said we'd have to find me a boyfriend in time, then said Things! and asked Things if he would like to be a father and he said "probably not quite yet" and i said that "if Things decides not to be the father between now and time then I nominate Stitch" and Ari said "Stitch is closer, that would work better"
<Aurora> 6and if you're still confused, maybe just "aurora" and "roara" should be the only names you use for me
<May> 14wow XD
<Newberrytiger> 14Hmm? What kind of revolutionary struggle do you mean?
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Floofbeer
<May> 14Aurora

<HyperMetalLugia> 02I can barely get into it
<Creideiki> The "room of work" which contains my piano, computer, TV, and is essentially the room I need to do stuff in related to my studies and my "clean" hobbies.
<Theguesst> Any games you aren't using?
<Theguesst> I might take them off your hands.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02It's all Junk

<HyperMetalLugia> 02Bit of pieces of robot kits, cases, toys and just random things
<Creideiki> And then half the furnace room. Which is filled with a wide variety of electronic bits and bobs, once house a full Wall of Computing Power, but is now recuded to File Cabinet of Computing Power. And lots of electronics cruft that I need to clean out/toss out sometime. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Youre insane

<Stryker> Awesome. :3 I passed out earlier today, so I'm getting some sleep back. xD
<Creideiki> However, the end result would be a grand total of .5 square metres of open floor space. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> 02All my stuff is in 1 room, since I compact all my stuff into my closet
<Theguesst> I could imagine...
<Creideiki> (And would feel like a WWII submarine not a place to live in. :P )
<Stryker> It is? I noticed it's on sale on Steam nao, so I was wondering.
<Curly> MoW's an RTS though

*DoomCricket pumps Stryker's stomach and clones a new Curly
<where> D:
<Proto> I think I'll be going now, night all.
*where makes a Curly from the old bits
<varchld> The missions in it are better than MoW, but multiplayer is really much better, especially when playing with friends
<where> heh.
<Light_Latias> 12packrat o3o
*where waves goodbye to Proto
<where> I'm off too.
<Theguesst> You have to

<Curly> Stryker: MoW singleplayer is super hard
<Stryker> ;_;
*Stryker curls up and dies, then.
<where> D:
<Curly> I can't get passed the second level
*where was only joking
<Aurora> 6Feather
<Stryker> Or... just avoid singleplayer. XD
<Feather|Art> 10?
<Aurora> 6I have to give up on use sharing that avatar XD
*DoomCricket uses pheonix down on Stryker
<HyperMetalLugia> 02To make it even harder to move around, I have my Wireless dongles on a stand right next to the middile of the "walkway"
*Stryker thinks that might be a better idea.
<Stryker> :O
<Theguesst> I get rid of stuff all the time
<Theguesst> If it doesn't work, take it apart and salvage what's left
<Theguesst> Throw the rest away
<Aurora> 6because a bunch of people are gonna have one >.>
*Aurora 6runs
<Curly> you're defending with one tank, three AT guns, and a bunch of dudes again like dozens of tanks and a hundred men >.>
<Feather|Art> 10?!

<Aurora> 6wait

<HyperMetalLugia> 02soo
<Aurora> 6Xai has one
<Feather|Art> 10Yeah..
<Curly> and they can shoot at the thing you're supposed to be defending
<Curly> MoW doesn't work that way
<varchld> And watch TychoCelchuu's MoW videos to learn how to play
<Curly> not the singleplayer anyway
<Aurora> 6and kyu's been buggering me
<Aurora> 6for one
<Light_Latias> 12o3o

<Aurora> 6i was gonna draw one
<Stryker> Yes, sir, varchld sir.
<Curly> yes :O
*Stryker salutes.
<Aurora> 6then I realized
<Aurora> 6I can draw something else
<Theguesst> Help, I'm drowning in a sea of fangirls!
*Aurora 6runs

<Curly> oh, and if you ever go against me, don't use mines DX
<Curly> mines are the most tediously annoying things ever >_>
<varchld> hehe
<Curly> and you basically end up winning because it takes like 10 minutes to get rid of them <_<
*Stryker places mines.
<Creideiki> I remember from kindergarten those "Beware of stranger" videos.
*DoomCricket lays lotsa mines around Curly to protect her
<varchld> I was thinking that a mortar or artillery might clear mines better
<Curly> in a game with a time limit >_>
<Light_Latias> 12No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
<Curly> O:
<Light_Latias> 12one for each of you

<HyperMetalLugia> 02:o
<Light_Latias> 12so like:
<Light_Latias> 12my mom
<Light_Latias> 12told me to tell her
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Are you a drug dealer?
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<Light_Latias> 12that since SHE is a stranger
<Light_Latias> 12she must be one too XD

<Curly> I've never played Civ
*Curly looks up a video
<Curly> I've always heard about it though >.>
<Curly> fyi Stryker, with MoW you can basically ignore fuel for everything but wheeled vehicles
<Curly> tanks can last an entire game without refueling
<Curly> wheeled vehicles run out after about 10 minutes of driving around >.>
<varchld> mmm, I think I ran out once with a truck, that'd be it
<Curly> I run out all the time with my trucks :(
<Curly> and even then only on the big maps
<Curly> and I just buy a new truck when one runs out xD
<varchld> I never found out how to refuel properly, I know how to scavenge fuel from another vehicle though
<varchld> I do so love repairing and looting tanks
<Curly> I never thought about looting like that :(

<Andrew> cheese
<Irene> 07Hey Andrew
<Irene> 07How are you
<Nick> comrade BF
<Nick> welcome
<Bloatedfish> hey
<Bloatedfish> how are you?
<Nick> good, in college atm
<Nick> are you?
<Bloatedfish> writing the first draft of a presentation about rifles
<Bloatedfish> we have one guy in my team who never appears
<Bloatedfish> SO
<Umbreon> 12yay Nick :D
<Umbreon> 12and Bloatedfish as well
<Bloatedfish> we've decided to offload all the hard tasks on to him, so that when we haven't done them we can just say that we agreed that he would do them
<Bloatedfish> hi Umbreon o//
<Bloatedfish> what college jou at?
<Nick> lol?
<Nick> and Rifles?
<Bloatedfish> yes
<Bloatedfish> rifles
<Nick> you at a military college or somethign?
<Bloatedfish> rifling
<Bloatedfish> shooty things
<Nick> hey Umbreon!
<Bloatedfish> no, I'm not
<Nick> lol
<Bloatedfish> we just have to do the presentation for product design
<Bloatedfish> I'm doing the "history" of rifles
<Nick> so anyway how you like Jardie land like
<Nick> ah
<Bloatedfish> it's alright
<Bloatedfish> a lot of homeless people
<Nick> how far back you going?
<Bloatedfish> err
<Bloatedfish> 15th century germany, apparently
<Nick> if its like WW1/WW2 I could be able to shed some light
<Nick> ugh too far back
<Bloatedfish> I have one book saying rifling was invented in Nuremburg, another in Augsburg
<Bloatedfish> so I'm just saying "probably invented in 15th century germany, but nobody really knows lol"
<Nick> hmm
<Nick> 15th century sounds a bit far back for rifles
<Bloatedfish> well rifles weren't really used for war until the american war of independence
<Bloatedfish> and even then, only becuase people had to
<Bloatedfish> or, that's what my two-page article on rifles says <.<
<Bloatedfish> but it was found that they were actually decent for killing people as well as hunting, so the British army began developing it's own military rifles in retalliation
<Bloatedfish> before then rifles weren't really used for warfare becuase the projectiles of the time were smooth lead balls that quickly degraded the rifling and the gunpowder of the time quickly clogged a weapon's rifling
<Bloatedfish> neither of which really mattered too much when you're hunting, apparently
<Nick> lol
<Nick> muskets caused terrible injuries they were like mini cannon balls
<Bloatedfish> yeah
<Nick> but woefully inaccurate hence why they turned to rifles
<Nick> hmm my lesson starts in 15 mins best get some food down me
<Nick> laters

<Umbreon> 12what i wanted Quilava to see it
<LizardGirl> mike's compy is all slow today. it was waaaay faster before it updated itself
<Aurora> 6because I disapprove of the ownership script

<Umbreon> 12:3
<May> 14I'm getting PS btw

<May> 14silly

<May> 14no lol
<May> 14pirating
<May> 14always
<Aurora> 6....ABSOLUTELY NOT LOL
<Umbreon> 12May
<Aurora> 6PS IS CRAP FOR SPRITING
<May> 14is not
<Umbreon> 12i think MS Pain is perfect for spriting
<LizardGirl> i woke up this morning and nothing was open on it. there was a little bubble thingy by the system tray saying it had updated
<Aurora> 6use MS paint
<May> 14noway
<Quilava> squeak
<Aurora> 6yeah
<May> 14I animate stuff
<Umbreon> 12i only use photoshop
<Umbreon> 12to make the sprites transparent backgrounds
<Espeon> then get adobe fireworks for easymode animations
*Espeon dies
<Aurora> 6using PS for spriting is like buying a Ferrari and driving 10mph on open highway
<May> 14lol
<Espeon> well, look at it this way
<May> 14well, I tried GIMP2 for sprites
*Umbreon :3
<May> 14didn't like it
<Aurora> 6and I'm being serious lol
<Espeon> it's really like stealing a ferrari and doing so
<Aurora> 6well yeah
<Umbreon> 12~slang espeon
<Espeon> because she doesn't buy it
<LizardGirl> i might play some games in a little bit

<Aurora> 6for that you usually get PS essentials
*LizardGirl sings along
<Irene> 07if it had a bloody text feature
<Irene> 07Ah
<Aurora> 6because essentials is like photoshop, just not as expensive
<Aurora> 6but it has photo editing
<Aurora> 6i hated it though because I wanted to draw
<Espeon> well, the expensive part isn't really a factor...
<Espeon> most of the time

<Icydragon> 12Right after that was the Yahoo saga correct?
<drfsupercenter> 03honestly, PAL *is* better quality than NTSC, just most stuff isn't made in that format
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's just converted
<drfsupercenter> 03but for European bands, when the videos are shot in that format..
<Prince-dari> Nah, it was Iggy after.
<Icydragon> 12Right.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02If only we had a single TV/Video format, everything will be a bit better
<Icydragon> 12Then Cynder7
<Icydragon> 12Then Yahoo
<HyperMetalLugia> 02*would
<drfsupercenter> 03like 1080p? :P
<drfsupercenter> 03Blu-Rays are international
<HyperMetalLugia> 02NATL
<Prince-dari> Lol, you really are pedobear.
<drfsupercenter> 03besides the region coding, at least
<HyperMetalLugia> 02NATAL
<drfsupercenter> 03I imported a Blu-Ray from the UK and it plays fine

<Icydragon> 12Then Vulcan tried to seduce me...
<Prince-dari> LOL
<Icydragon> 12Then I got back at him by taking Cyndi...
<Icydragon> 12Oh, that was a funny week
<Prince-dari> Oh yeah we always used to annoy Icy by saying he was gay.
<Icydragon> 12Vulcan stilll has no idea what happened. XD
<Icydragon> 12Good times.
<Prince-dari> So NF, if you don't like shooters, what do you like?
<Icydragon> 12Damn, I was here for 2 and a half years.
<Icydragon> 12Platformers...
<Icydragon> 12Is it creepy that I know that?
<NF> platformers and racing games mainly
<NF> .... probably because i've mentioned it here multiple times
<Icydragon> 12And I remember... everything....

<HyperMetalLugia> 02Hi Kredit
<Prince-dari> So why dislike shooters?
<NF> well its mainly 1st person shooters Just really hate that mode. I do like some shooters though like sin and punishment star successor
<Icydragon> 12I like third-person shooters.
<Icydragon> 12Like Starwars battlefront, and war for cybertron
<Prince-dari> So you don't like CoD? There is a 3rd person mode in it.
<NF> call of duty..... pass
<Prince-dari> On 6 anyway.

<Skylands> 10which is pretty lame if you ask me
<Roleplay4life> 5I read the first book, so I can.
<May> 14Christine is the girl who fangirls over everything
<drfsupercenter> 03you know what else is lame
<Soyuz> hell
<HyperMetalLugia> 02So it doesn't make much difference
<Dragonite> 07I've watched the movies
<Soyuz> maybe even a Unix is better
<Soyuz> but its too old
<drfsupercenter> 03the fact that Twilight totally stole their cover image from Snow White.
<Roleplay4life> 5I do nooooooooot. D:

<Roleplay4life> 5 /armed with Master Ball
<Soyuz> in which I made it not freeze
<Roleplay4life> 5MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE.

<Roleplay4life> 5Mewtwo

<Cat> yay for girls
<LaptopAristeo> Hmmm
<Cat> D:
<Skylands> 10well Kyu
<Sneas> They actually improved instead of degraded
*HyperMetalLugia glows red hot
<Skylands> 10many people honestly don't care either way about twilight
*HyperMetalLugia charges at May
<Skylands> 10they just claim to hate it, since it's overrated
*May runs and hides on top of Christine >>
<Roleplay4life> 5But I'm not one of those fangirls that thinks Mewtwo is worth my affections. HAHAHAno. I actually think those kind of fangirls are kind of creepy. He's fictional and he's a mutant kitty.
<May> 14...Waaaaait
<HyperMetalLugia> 02You admited it!
<LaptopAristeo> Kitten: Thank you very much Kitten, but I'm actually talking to her and being honest with her, so I don't think I need help quite yet :3
<Roleplay4life> 5Admitted what what?
<drfsupercenter> 03<Dragonite> you just have to find one thing you don't like about it lol <- unless you're me, in which case I can point out SEVERAL reasons why Apple products suck and people STILL try to say I'm wrong
*drfsupercenter hides
<May> 14people write stories of little girls falling in love with Mewtwo?
<LaptopAristeo> erm, talking with her and being frank with her**
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Yup
<May> 14are you serious?
<Roleplay4life> 5I HATE THOSE STORES
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Just like SANTA CLAUS
<Roleplay4life> 5OMIGOSH I HATE THEm
*HyperMetalLugia runs
<Roleplay4life> 5**THEM
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<Kitten> why are you being frank and not chris?
<May> 14THAT IS SO WRONG
<Roleplay4life> 5They do, May, they do. DDD:
<Soyuz> where would I find the disk?
<LaptopAristeo> Frank is a pretty cool name
<Soyuz> ij C:?
<May> 14BUT I KIND OF WANT TO READ THEM JUST TO SEE
<LaptopAristeo> Why not frank?
<Dragonite> 07you're confusing opinions and facts DRF
*May flails
<Roleplay4life> 5Well usually they're not that little... like 16-25 years old...
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Just like a werewolf and a girl
<Kitten> because your not frank your chris
<LaptopAristeo> oops
<drfsupercenter> 03regardless. LOL
<Kitten> so so you should not be being frank with her
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Not the best match
<Dragonite> 07you only need one error to have a bad opinion of something
*LaptopAristeo will have to correct the situation then
<drfsupercenter> 03Fact: Apple products are overpriced
<Cat> I could be frank if I felt like it
<LaptopAristeo> Thank you for the advise :)
<May> 14Christine
<Roleplay4life> 5May, just look at FF.net and search "Mewtwo". HE NEVER TRAVELS WITH MALES. WTH. D|

<Roara|Laundry> 6....
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Hmmm...
<Roara|Laundry> 6lol 3 hour dead period
<Creideiki> Hmm... perplexing, whom do you think would win in a fight, the HAL 9000, Skynet or GLaDOS?
<HyperMetalLugia> 02That is a good question..
<HyperMetalLugia> 02But Glados Vs. Skynet is better
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Since they both are ON a Planet
<drfsupercenter> 03SKynet.
<Umbreon> 12i'm not sure what is happening
<Creideiki> (Skynet has nukes. But GLaDOS has portals. And HAL is in space. However. Skynet goes all timeywimey. GLaDOS has to deal with Chell. And HAL is in space.)
<HyperMetalLugia> 02And Skynet has ME
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Nukes Beat Glados
<May> 14hmm
<May> 14brb
<HyperMetalLugia> 02HAL is well next to jupiter
<HyperMetalLugia> 02And he can't even fight\
<Creideiki> Yes. But HAL also can't get nuked or flung through a portal.
<Creideiki> (Whereas GLaDOS can just portal away the nukes. :P )
<Creideiki> (Or more hilarious the "infinitely falling nuclear missile" :P
*LizardGirl fluffles the kitten, snuggles her and gives her a treat ^-^
<HyperMetalLugia> 02But Skynet can beat GLADOS before she portals the nukes away (if they can travel that short of a time)
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Though Skynet *is* bigger than GLaDOS
<LaptopAristeo> :)
*LizardGirl throws LaptopAristeo in her birdbath
<LizardGirl> :p
<LaptopAristeo> noooooo
<LizardGirl> you smell funny though :p

<HyperMetalLugia> 02Wow, david after dentist has 69,940,167 views....
<Armageddon> o-o
<Sneas> 3o.o
<Creideiki> Well, assuming Aperture Science is in the US.
<Creideiki> Then Skynet needs to send Russian missiles.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Or Geneva...
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Or whereever the LHC is
<Creideiki> Which can give thirty minutes warning.
<Creideiki> If GLaDOS is in Switzerland... then still maybe three/four minutes warning.
<Creideiki> More then enough time to have fun with portals. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> 02But, they haven't told us how large the RANGE of the Portals are, or how far away from their source they can be
<HyperMetalLugia> 02It also appears that Only 2 Portals can be active at a time
<HyperMetalLugia> 02So a large assult of missles, from different directions would be a problem

<Theguesst> And hello HML
<HypeMetalLugia> 02Hi
<Chimera> LL
<Chimera> What exactly was bad about Other M?
<Light_Latias> 12I haven't played it yet
<HypeMetalLugia> 02Everybody seems to dislike it
<Light_Latias> 12but
<Light_Latias> 12what I've heard
*Light_Latias shudders
<Chimera> :/
<Theguesst> I've heard it appeals to the new school gaming crowd.
<Theguesst> That means it's easy
<HypeMetalLugia> 02I want hard SNES style games
<Chimera> Lol
<Theguesst> Along with that, the story turns the series on it's head
<Theguesst> Same HML
<Chimera> I want a hard but not stupidly hard game
<Chimera> :|
<Theguesst> That's why I skipped it
<Chimera> Sonic 4 tried to balance that
<Theguesst> First nintendo wii game I ever skipped.
<Light_Latias> 12lolz
<Theguesst> Still failed
<Light_Latias> 12I'm skipping it too
<Theguesst> Sonic 4 is uber easy
<Chimera> Levels were either easy or just mindblowingly difficult
<Chimera> And heh
<Chimera> Theguesst
<HypeMetalLugia> 02Though MMX was the perfect dificulty
<Theguesst> Moving on...
<Light_Latias> 12because I want to keep the Samus from MP in my head
<Chimera> Final boss
<Chimera> That is HELL.
<HypeMetalLugia> 02I know
<Theguesst> ORLY
<HypeMetalLugia> 02I took me 9 tries

<HypeMetalLugia> 02All on camera I recored the Ending
<Stormy> Lambda

*Andres lickhugsnuggletackles the Curlywurly!
*Curly pokes Ari suspiciously
<Curly> maybe he has cameras on us :O
<Curly> hey Andres ^^
*Curly huggles
<varchld> O: So risque of him
<eXAKR> !define using

<eXAKR> o

*Umbreon now belongs to eXAKR for 17 minutes
<EpicStatsGuy> Murrrnapples :3
<DarkKnight> LLOTS? May I private chat?

<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Damos03)02WB* - <Damos> 13It's a hoppy day today
*Curly perches on var's head and pokes at the cameras
*Andres noms the cameras.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> DarkKnight: Go ahead
*DarkKnight slaps Damos with a bitch

*Drake yawns
<DarkKnight> Odd question for everybody....
<DarkKnight> What browser do you use?
<Andres> Slly crashes and showers D:
<Andres> Hiagain
<varchld> Eww showers D:
<Andres> D:
<Andres> But Andres is all clean now, is that not good? :o
<BossMan> hello
*BossMan looks around
<varchld> Hi BossMan
<Andres> Hello
<varchld> And yes, clean is good
<BossMan> sorry about being idle so long.. I connected then had to go out and do some things
*Andres rages.
<Andres> These bus times are ridiculous :x
<Andres> I have an option to wether be late or to be an hour early :x
<eXAKR> Freaking a holes
<eXAKR> There was someone indiscriminately spraying insecticides around my neighbourhood
<eXAKR> I called the environmental agency to complain
<eXAKR> Then the guy slipped away
<eXAKR> When I went to where he was, no trace of him
<BossMan> hour early then
<eXAKR> Damn.
<Andres> Yeah, but that means I have to be ready in an hour D:
<BossMan> gotta love the bus :)
<BossMan> I did my fair share of bus riding believe me
<BossMan> it sucks
<Persian> (DarkKnight) Odd question for everybody....
<Persian> (DarkKnight) What browser do you use?
<Persian> Google Chrome
<DarkKnight> Lemme guess. On Windows?
<Persian> NO.
<Persian> -caps
<DarkKnight> lol
<DarkKnight> Mac, FTW
<Persian> On windows, I'd use firefox.
<Persian> On Linux, I'd use Chromium.
<Persian> With mac, I'm happy with my Chrome.
<eXAKR> o
<eXAKR> anyway bbl
<Persian> I made a theme for it and everything
<DarkKnight> At last, a smart person.
<DarkKnight> Chrome sucks nuts on Windows, IMO
<Andres> Hai, Kitteh!
<Persian> It's slower on Windows, I've noticed.
<DarkKnight> Snow Leopard / BootCamp: Windows 7.
<DarkKnight> :D
<Persian> I'd need a DVD to do that, as much as I'd want to
<DarkKnight> Why?
<Persian> Because Windows 7 is larger than a CD.
<DarkKnight> lol
<BossMan> a kitten hm?
<DarkKnight> True.
<DarkKnight> Speaking of DVD's, etc....
<DarkKnight> My DVD drive in my MacBook Pro died... lol
<DarkKnight> I sent it to Apple, and they asked me if I wanted to upgrade to a slot-load Blu-Ray drive.
<DarkKnight> I'm like YES! :D

<eXAKR> Not many people use Telnet
<Airwolve> depends on what it's set up to use I believe
<Airwolve> though to simplify it it's an outdated form of remote access
<Irene> 07I accidentally used it once
<Irene> 07but what IS it
<eXAKR> I only installed it just to see this: http://lifehacker.com/373571/watch-star-wars-in-text-via-telnet

*Quanyails 7pokes Chimera
<Quanyails> 7Do realize whatshisname, the creator of said media, says that he doesn't really change physically.
<Quanyails> 7Stop lagging, me. D:
<Quanyails> 7And May?
<May> 14so you're saying Yugi had a split-personality?
<Quanyails> 7No.
<May> 14because I don't think getting taller and more deadly is a split personality
<May> 14so he is changing physcially
<Quanyails> 7Well, you know the story.
<Quanyails> 7He doesn't actually grow a foot and vocal cords lengthen.
<Quanyails> 7And eyes... and hair... and clothes...
<Quanyails> 7It's all artistic.
<Quanyails> 7May, am I lagging?
<May> 14well, that seems odd to me

<Quanyails> 7About the lack of Dan Green in later series:
<Quanyails> 7This is one reason I prefer GX over 5Ds.
<Quanyails> 7They reference the original series ALL THE TIME.
<May> 14I never watched the rest of the series
<May> 14I stopped as soon as I discovered there was no Yugi
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Quanyails> 7Lol
<Quanyails> 7No, Yugi's still in GX.
<Kipi> Lawl
<May> 14hmm

<Chimera> wut
<Chimera> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Not moar fangirlism
*HyperMetalLugia hides
<Quanyails> 7O_o
<Quanyails> 7No, that was not fangirlism.
<Quanyails> 7My source of fangirlism is lagging.
*Kyu places Quanyails on the SLOWLY ROTATING PLATFORM OF SLOWNESS!!!
<Quanyails> 7KYU

<Quanyails> 7http://mibpaste.com/Nc6VBU
<Quanyails> 7For Chimera.
<Chimera> :з <-- this face looks cute LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Is it really all artistic?
*HyperMetalLugia runs
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<Quanyails> 7Yes, HML. :|
<Quanyails> 7And maybe for something for fangirls to look at.
<Quanyails> 7That's the reasoning for Riku's inclusion in Coded, anyway.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02I AM A bIG BOI NOW
<HyperMetalLugia> 02That is Yugi
<HyperMetalLugia> 02AKA. Mr. Deep Voice
<Kyu> 07Quan
<Kyu> 07why wouldn't all the stuff happen?
<Quanyails> 7And NOW here comes the fangirlism, HML.
<Kyu> 07it's called "magic"
<Kyu> 07o3o
<Quanyails> 7Well, there's that, but why would people not realize it, then?
<Chimera> Wat
<Chimera> Quan no
<Quanyails> 7In the early manga, Tea realizes that not-Dan Green changes, but in voice only, when she's blindfolded.
<Sneas> 03:з
<Chimera> yeah
<Chimera> but nobody else does
<Chimera> Wasn't something like that on the TV once?
<Quanyails> 7ô.o
<Chimera> Like, a more child-friendly version XD
<Chimera> erm
<Quanyails> 7Explain?
<Chimera> well
<Chimera> on the TV show
<Quanyails> 7You mean anime?
<Chimera> YEP
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Chimera> *caps
<Chimera> It showed Yugi and Tia at a restaraunt
<Quanyails> 7Tea*
<Quanyails> 7X3
<Chimera> k
<Chimera> X3
<Quanyails> 7Ah, this is after Duelist Kingdom.
<Chimera> She ended up getting blindfolded
<Quanyails> 7The date, right?
<Quanyails> 7No?
<Chimera> I think
<Quanyails> 7That's the first anime series.
<Chimera> I DUN REMMEBER
<Chimera> DUN JUDGE ME
*Chimera flees
<Quanyails> 7Same thing--manga adapted to anime.
<Quanyails> 7Same event. D:
<Quanyails> 7Pre-Duelist Kingdom.
*Quanyails 7releases a spurt of fangirlism stuff.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02-Fangirl Filter Activated-
*HyperMetalLugia wonders why the chat is empty....
<Quanyails> 7LOL
<Quanyails> 7And Kyu.
<Quanyails> 7About the Orichalcos arc... :|
<Kyu> 07it was lame D:
<Quanyails> 7Why? D:
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Hmm, do YOU know why it is soo empty?
<Quanyails> 7Wangst, I'm assuming?
<Quanyails> 7Character supposed flanderization and exaggeration?
<Kyu> 07because it was too off from the main storyline
<Chimera> ^
<Quanyails> 7So... what about Noah's arc or the KC Grand Championship? Same thing?
<Kyu> 07noah's was lame too lol
<Kyu> 07and i forget the kc arc o.o
<Kyu> 07what was that one again
<Quanyails> 7Right after Orichalcos.
<Quanyails> 7With the Marluxia Expy.
<Quanyails> 7*trope*
<May> 14MY GOD WHAT'S WITH THIS ORANGE WALL
<Quanyails> 7XD
<HyperMetalLugia> 02What wall?
<Quanyails> 7I'd say that the Grand Championship was mostly pointless, except that the antagonist reminded me of Marluxia.
<Chimera> ew
<HyperMetalLugia> 02All I see is blanks
<Chimera> Noah's Arc
<Chimera> that was confusing
<Quanyails> 7It's Kaiba fanservice.
<Quanyails> 7Good for whoever likes him.
<Quanyails> 7:3
<Quanyails> 7Oh, yeah:
<Kyu> 07me
<Kyu> 07XP
<Quanyails> 7Noah himself is an expy of season zero Kaiba.
<Roleplay4life> 5Gaaah. Why in this sub do they have to put Mewtwo's words in STRANGE, DIFFICULT-TO-READ FONT. >< It's bad enough it's in another language lol~ /complaaaaain
<Quanyails> 7Green hair, white clothes.
<Roleplay4life> 5Hiya Creideiki!
<Creideiki> Hello peoples
<Quanyails> 7Jerkier than he normally is.
<Quanyails> 7Oh, yeah:
<Creideiki> Roleplay4life: They put it in a hard to read font because they're being artsy. And don't realze that not everyone has a 700 metre TV. :P
<Quanyails> 7Noah's arc has one good thing to it, though: soundtrack.
<Creideiki> (And that sans serif fonts must die and long, horrible and painful death.)
<Quanyails> 7And the puns, I guess. Even if they're sorta lame.
<Quanyails> 7And a stupid yet fascinating jarring of edutainment and genre switching.
<Roleplay4life> 5@Creideiki :: Oh ffff. But it's on YOUTUBE.
<Quanyails> 7And that scene with Kaiba throwing cards at Tristan while a robot monkey attacks him and they run away on motorcycles.
<Roleplay4life> 5And it's only /his words/ ahahaha.
<Quanyails> 7Really. O_o
<Roleplay4life> 5I think it's a fansub.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02?.?
<Roleplay4life> 5This is what the top reads: "[Arceus FanSub] PM MO 01 - ¡Mewtwo Contraataca! (Sub. Español) - Parte 05/09"
<Creideiki> Ah.
<Creideiki> Well, again, people being artsy is the explanation.
<Creideiki> And they deserve a very rapid, and very firm application of a boot to the head.
<Chimera> Quan
<Quanyails> 7:|
<Chimera> that monkey
<Quanyails> 7What about the Mother 3 fansub?
<Chimera> it made me wat XD
<Chimera> also Quan
<Chimera> Wasn't that the same series with the Lavyathin?
<Chimera> (jewish creature lol)
<Quanyails> 7Leviathan? Yes.
<Roleplay4life> 5But it could be worse.. Font's not too bad as long as I pause.
<Chimera> heh
<Quanyails> 7I particularly liked the Orichalcos arc because it was darker than the rest of the series.
<Quanyails> 7AND IT WASN'T IN ANY TOURNAMENT.
<Creideiki> Which is not a good thing, because needing to pause a movie to read the subtitles shows people who need better skills.
<Quanyails> 7Oh, yeah. And Dan Green fanservice.
<Creideiki> (Unless you could those MadTV sketches that parody Korean soap opreas. :P )
<Kyu> 07well I'm off
<Quanyails> 7Don't get me wrong, the fanservice isn't the only reason I liked the Orichalcos arc. XD
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Beyes
<Kyu> 07heading back home to do birthdaystuffs
<Creideiki> Namely, the joke of *five minute monologue in Korean* Subtitle: "Yes."
<Quanyails> 7Ah...
<Creideiki> And: *a short monosyllabic word* Subtitles: Cover the screen, in flowery, almost Shakespeare like text. :P

<HyperMetalLugia> 02Interesting
<LizardGirl> cig time ^-^
<Curly> is it just me or is it annoying when everyone thinks you're an immigrant :I
<LizardGirl> i still haven't made mike help me get dressed yet today

<LizardGirl> XD
<LaptopAristeo> Hehe
<Curly> I'm 100% Canadian though >_>
<LaptopAristeo> My sister is asian \o/
<LaptopAristeo> Because Canadian is obviously a race

*LizardGirl squeeks and squirms
<Curly> it does DX
*Curly would have rather learned Japanese :I
<LizardGirl> well maybe i'll give you one :p
<Spyrorocks> why do we need to learn french when only one province speaks it and that province wants to seperate from canada
<LaptopAristeo> LizardGirl: pweese? :D
<Curly> it was French immersion Spyro
<Curly> I did it voluntarily
<LaptopAristeo> Spyrorocks: I don't know why you don't just let them separate
<Curly> 4 years of French immersion >.>
<Curly> why don't we have Japanese immersion D:

<Spyrorocks> whats in quebec we need anyways
<Spyrorocks> Nothing.
<Curly> I have no idea
*Curly has never really paid attention
<Spyrorocks> just angry french canadians.
<Roleplay4life> 5If I see the words "más fuerte" one more time in the subtitles...
<Spyrorocks> me either
<Spyrorocks> ontario has a lot of manufacturering.
<Spyrorocks> so we need them./
<Curly> I think one of the best universities in Canada is in Montreal
<Spyrorocks> quebec probably has lots of bread.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Mah Cherri
*HyperMetalLugia runs
<Spyrorocks> My aunt when to university in quebec.
<Roleplay4life> 5lolwut?
<Spyrorocks> we should just get a lot of huge drilling machines and seperate quebec and push them off into the ocean. they can be their own little continent.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Look, the moon! The moon! The moon came out!
*HyperMetalLugia points to the Half Moon ouside
<LaptopAristeo> Canada probably needs the population, resources, and military personell from Quebec
<LaptopAristeo> I think you guys should lose Quebec and annex part of the U.S.
*Quanyails 7blinks.
<LaptopAristeo> Washington, Montana, just whatever's touching the U.S. border
<Spyrorocks> I am french! I surrendor!
<Spyrorocks> we want alaska back.
<LaptopAristeo> That way, everything's a little more even
<Spyrorocks> we should invade washington
<Quanyails> 7Well, that figures; something odd musta've happened for not-Dan Green's LP counter to go to 98. O_o
<Spyrorocks> and take over your costco.
<Spyrorocks> and Target.
<LaptopAristeo> You don't want Alaska
<LaptopAristeo> Trust me
<Spyrorocks> I went to alaska
<Spyrorocks> its cool.
<May> 14how's the moon doing?
<May> 14TROLOLOOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Let's rock, baby!
*HyperMetalLugia runs
<LaptopAristeo> Every Canadian stereotype from the U.S. actually is accurate in Alaska
<LaptopAristeo> They really do use phrases like "don't cha know?" and "eh?" and stuff
<Curly> it's kind of funny how Canada is the States upside down
<HyperMetalLugia> 02-A *Hyper* Metal Lugia appeared-
<Curly> south is the US north and north is the US south
<Spyrorocks> alaskians love their guns as much as people from the south
<HyperMetalLugia> 02-The HML wants to battle!-
<LaptopAristeo> More so
<LaptopAristeo> They have the most liberal gun laws in the nation
<Spyrorocks> id actually move to alaska.
<Creideiki> The Washington Examiner seems to be rather... stupid: http://failblog.org/2010/02/09/news-fail-4/
<Curly> I don't know about Alaska but I know a few people who've worked at the Arctic
<Curly> they don't recommend it >.>
<Spyrorocks> alaska is the only place id ever move away from bc
<Spyrorocks> and I dont really want to move that badly.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Like the Spanish Kid taking Spanish class
<Curly> I don't think there are many places I'd trade Vancouver for <.<
*LaptopAristeo really would like to move to BC
<Spyrorocks> Vancouver is too much city for me.
<LaptopAristeo> I'm planning on visiting in the winter
<HyperMetalLugia> 02There going to do well anyway
<Curly> I've always lived in big cities
*Curly was born in Winnipeg
<Roleplay4life> 5Haha fail. But I wouldn't really put it so far beyond that. There are a lot of Spanish people who don't speak or write it all that fluently. A lot of what native speakers know is jargon and Spanglish, just like Americans and English.
<Curly> except maybe Duncan... but I barely remember that city :X
<Spyrorocks> chilliwack is good, we can go to vancover if we need to.
<Roleplay4life> 5So I wouldn't call the Washington Examiner all that fail after all.
<Spyrorocks> Vancouver is really liberal LaptopAristeo , you'd like it.
*LaptopAristeo is hoping to get Canadian citizenship while the laws are pretty cool about it
<Spyrorocks> if I could id move up past whistler.
<Spyrorocks> canada is a free for all for immigration.
<Roleplay4life> 5There are native speakers in my AP Spanish class after all. ;P
<Spyrorocks> Just remember aristeo, canada's gun laws are more strict than the strictest state
<Mikey> so I've been watching old pokemon episodes all day
<Mikey> and I'm convinced that ash is a [censored]ing moron
<Spyrorocks> you basically have to buy from the gangsters.
<Spyrorocks> my uncle is getting an awesome toy
<LaptopAristeo> I don't mind strict gun laws
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...

<drfsupercenter> 03Target will prob...oh hey

<drfsupercenter> 03where there's some bonus disc that comes with it
<drfsupercenter> 03or a fancy cover
<drfsupercenter> 03or somethign
<Aurora> 6As far as I know, there's no exclusives for this movie
<Umbreon> 12huh?
<drfsupercenter> 03hm, OK
<drfsupercenter> 03well anyway I'll prolly just buy it at Target when I'm home this weekend

<drfsupercenter> 03Aurora, you said it'll be $25 at Target?
<drfsupercenter> 03for how long, do you know? Like the first week?
<Aurora> 6no
<Aurora> 6I don't know
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<Aurora> 6I can't imagine it dropping in price for several weeks
<drfsupercenter> 03it's prolly the first week
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<drfsupercenter> 03it won't drop price
<drfsupercenter> 03it'll get more expensive
<drfsupercenter> 03I almost know more about Target than you do since I used to shop there so much
*drfsupercenter runs
<drfsupercenter> 03usually when stuff comes out, they have it at a special "sale" price for a week, then it geos up $5-10 to make it closer to "list" price
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why I try to buy stuff right away XD
<Aurora> 6I never pay attention
<Aurora> 6if i'm ever in a hurry like that
<Aurora> 6I don't pay attention to price

<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03you're trying to watch the football game?
<drf|laptop> 03I know the U of M game is at the same time as that one, XD

<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03there's a site called espn3.com
<Husker4life> 4Game's at 2:30, performance at three. And we have to stay and watch other baaands.
<Husker4life> 4I don't have a smartphone.
<drf|laptop> 03They keep replays of all the football games for at least a week

<Husker4life> 4LOL, I'll be getting score updates, don't worry. T
<drf|laptop> 03you know, I remember when I was in high school
<drf|laptop> 03someone wanted to know what was happening
<drf|laptop> 03so they literally marched with earbuds in
<drf|laptop> 03and they had a little radio in their pocket
<drf|laptop> 03and they were listening to the game via that LOL
<Husker4life> 4The people who run OMI (where I'm going) always call out score updates and time updates.
<drf|laptop> 03that would be good enough for me
<drf|laptop> 03I honestly don't get what there is to like about watching football
<Husker4life> 4Because they know we're all sacrificing our gametime to be there.
<drf|laptop> 03I was at a game once
<drf|laptop> 03and someone was all "OMG THAT PLAY, DID YOU SEE THAT???"
<drf|laptop> 03and I was like "Um, sure?"
<drf|laptop> 03it was just some dude getting tackled, IMO nothing special XD
<drf|laptop> 03I really only care when someone scores
<drf|laptop> 03then it's like whee
<Husker4life> 4It's just big because at the Championship game last year, Texas basically cheated and won at the last minute. So this year, here in Nebraska, it's been OMGREVEEEEEEEEENGE since December 1st last year.
<drf|laptop> 03Heh
<drf|laptop> 03yeah, we lost to our rivals last week. :(
<Husker4life> 4Dudes getting tackled is the best. D: Nebraska thrives on defense. They even get special practice jersies that are black. Thus, Blackshirts.
<drf|laptop> 03People from the rival school were going crazy, they pretty much vandalized the place >_>
<Husker4life> 4Oh, um, I meant to see that game but I didn't, DRF. ><
<Husker4life> 4What was the score?
<drf|laptop> 03um
<drf|laptop> 03I don't remember exactly
<drf|laptop> 03MSU won
<drf|laptop> 03like 32-10 or something crazy
<Husker4life> 4GWAAAAAAH ok.
<Husker4life> 4Eh, that's not that bad.
<drf|laptop> 03it was a pretty big victory
<drf|laptop> 03...

<Proto> Hey, Curly.
<Proto> Welcome back.
<Curly> hi Proto :)
<Curly> thankies

<Proto> You're very welcomes.
<LizardGirl> hiii Curly ^-^
<Nick> off to bed
<Nick> night everyone
<Curly> hi LizardGirl o/
*LizardGirl huggles Curly ^-^ <3
<LaptopAristeo> Aww :)

<Umbreon> 12lol Quilava
<Quilava> HMMMM???
<Umbreon> 12if i had a nickle for everytime i wished i had a fixed die
<Quilava> fixed die?
<LaptopAristeo> LizardGirl: Do you have any pictures of you and ChibiPuma together?
<Umbreon> 12i die
<LizardGirl> not right now. they're on my laptop
<Umbreon> 12that always flips heads
*LaptopAristeo nods
<Umbreon> 12sorry i should explain first
<Umbreon> 12in pokemon instead of flipping coins you are allowed to use dice to flips instead
<HyperMuzzledLugia> 02|Bye Nick
<Umbreon> 12basically the way it works is you flip a die, if it lands on an even number its considered heads
<LizardGirl> i've just been using mike's computer
<Umbreon> 12if it lands on an odd number its considered tails
<Light_Latias> 12ah XD
<LaptopAristeo> You should link them when you get your laptop -- I bet you two are adorable together ^^
<Light_Latias> 12<random>
<Umbreon> 12it'd be nice to have a dice that is tampered with so it will likely flip heads
<LizardGirl> maybe i will ;)
<LizardGirl> i'll have to upload them though
<Stitch> Do you both use the same wireless router?
<LizardGirl> we used to
<LizardGirl> i moved into an appartment in town
<Stitch> :o
<Espeon> lol
<LizardGirl> and right now i'm living with mike while he's taking care of me
<Stitch> Ah.

<Umbreon> 12not the game itself
<Umbreon> 12even if the music can make or break a game
<Light_Latias> 12music is part of the game
<Umbreon> 12just imagine if guitar hero had no music
<Umbreon> 12XDDD
<Light_Latias> 12and criting a part means criting the who-LOL

<theguesst> I'm still in shock
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<theguesst> no really, I nearly got killed
<Umbreon> 12try me
<Umbreon> 12i once waited 40 minutes in line at a subway
<theguesst> 'Someone attempted to hit my head with 2 apples in a car
<HyperMuzzledLugia> 02What?
<Umbreon> 12o-O wow
<theguesst> So they were stalking me and targeting me specifically
<Light_Latias> 12O_O
<Light_Latias> 12WHAT
<HyperMuzzledLugia> 02Ouch..
<theguesst> I was on my bike as well

<Light_Latias> 12did you take down the license plate number?
<HyperMuzzledLugia> 02THose evil monsters
<theguesst> Fell off and scraped my knee up good
<theguesst> I was in shoch both times, so no
<theguesst> shock*
*Light_Latias faceclaws
<Light_Latias> 12the rule of thumb
<theguesst> I did absolutely nothing
<Umbreon> 12maybe it wasn't intentional but simply a matter of bad luck
<Light_Latias> 12if an idiot tries something in a car
<Light_Latias> 12get the plate >_<
<Light_Latias> 12still, Umbre
<Light_Latias> 12it shows that person should be less careless
<Umbreon> 12i know
<Umbreon> 12i know
<HyperMuzzledLugia> 02Throwing apples is not normal
<Umbreon> 12theguesst

<Umbreon> 12after much resistence
<theguesst> I tried

<theguesst> I'm getting paranoid about everything again
<HyperMuzzledLugia> 02:o
<HyperMuzzledLugia> 02What are you paranoid about?
<theguesst> I get paranoid whenever I'm stressed
<Light_Latias> 12now you know
<Light_Latias> 12get the plate if it EVER happens again >_>
<theguesst> And nearly getting struck in the head by a 70 mph speeding apple counts as stress
<theguesst> TWICE
<theguesst> in different spots
<Light_Latias> 12was it a whole apple?
<Light_Latias> 12or a core?
<theguesst> yep
<theguesst> whole thing
<HyperMuzzledLugia> 02Whole...
<Light_Latias> 12O_O
<HyperMuzzledLugia> 02Did you go to the hospital?
<Light_Latias> 12then it wasn't an accident -_-
<theguesst> the second time I fell off my bike, scraped my knee and was so afraid that I asked a friendly stranger to help escourt me home
<theguesst> He was kind enough to do so
<Soyuz> it a Draje
<HyperMuzzledLugia> 02Well, luckily you wern't severly injured
<theguesst> Afterwords, I cleaned up my knee, patched myself up and turned on my laptop to tell someone
<Umbreon> 12:/
<theguesst> you guys happened to be the closest people since my friends are busy and another group is running a charity
<Light_Latias> 12how about your parents?

<Umbreon> 12how fun do you think guitar hero would be, if it had no music
<Proto> Hi hi ^^
<Lambda|Drawing> Hey Proto
<Light_Latias> 12lolz
<Proto> Hi.
<theguesst> Well it's just a rythum game like DDR
<theguesst> those games need gimmics
<HyperMuzzledLugia> 02It would be better without the music
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<HyperMuzzledLugia> 02So all you did was press randombuttons
<theguesst> It would be more competitive, that's for sure

<Creideiki> Hello people
<Umbreon> 12you just sit there holding a guitar doing nothing else saying "i'm i done yet?"
<HyperMuzzledOkami> 02Hi Kredit
<Umbreon> 12am i*
<HyperMuzzledOkami> 02I saw big peaches in the beginning of the game, and the 52IN TV and upconversion to 720P made them look even better
*HyperMuzzledOkami runs
<Creideiki> Blah... went to Fallsview Casino today (on account of getting into the $20.01 buffet for $12 bus fare.
<Creideiki> Their food is ungood, my stomach feels rather bleg.
<HyperMuzzledOkami> 02Let's just hope you're not posioned
<Creideiki> If I was... yay free PAC points.
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
*Light_Latias calls Pac-Man?
<Creideiki> (Which means jack nothing since I have a grand total of... 7 PAC points. :P

<theguesst> Thanks for standing still, wanker
<Umbreon> 12imagine if LoZ had no music Light_Latias
<Umbreon> 12D:
*theguesst hides
<Creideiki> I have however discovered the way to get lots of "free" PAC points.
<Creideiki> Although to do so does, in the long run, lose money. And takes roughly a bloody day. :P
<HyperMuzzledOkami> 02XD
<Creideiki> 25 cent roulette + bet on red and black + keep hitting the "Spin/Rebet" button.
<Creideiki> You will - on most spins - neither win nor lose anything.
<Creideiki> (Duh... you lose one of the bets, with the other bet, which pays back itself and the other bet.)
<Creideiki> Keep doing that and you'll eventually end up racking up the PAC points, becuase, each spin loses you 25 cents, and you get a PAC point every 40 dollars (and since you win back that 25 cents, you're essentially losing nothing).
<Creideiki> Except on 0.
<Creideiki> Then you lose fifty cents outright. :P

<Lyon> 04hi Quan
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hey, Lyon.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6'sup?
<Creideiki> (Also, as an aside on that "free PAC point method"... in the 160 spins of the wheel you need, to get the $40.00; you - if the wheel acted "perfect" would zero out a total of 4 times. So, you get 1 PAC point - which costs $40.00 - for a grand total price of $2.00; which is not bad, eh?)
<Lyon> 04nothing much, you?

<Ray> 02hey, sky may i ask you something?
<Skylands> 10Sure
<Ray> 02Who started the FLOOF fad?
<HyperMuzzledFan> 02http://i55.tinypic.com/6tjyao.jpg
<Lyon> 04...
<Lyon> 04lol
<HyperMuzzledFan> 02Deal with it
<Skylands> 10Well
*HyperMuzzledFan sunglasses
<Skylands> 10it dates back to even before I was on TST
<Lyon> 04that is ANCIENT times
<Skylands> 10I'm not sure who started it
*Lyon hides
<Skylands> 10might've been Kyu, dunno
<Ray> 02xeli may know...
<HyperMuzzledFan> 02Still a stupid fad
<eXAKR> It started in ancient times
<HyperMuzzledFan> 02With the romans?
<eXAKR> In the ancient years of the early 2000's, I think'
<Skylands> 10Xeli is only a month older than me (TST registration date-wise) @Ray
<Ray> 02o.o
<Skylands> 10So I doubt he'd know any different
<Ray> 02so Drf ma-- no i don't think that he cares erm... arti?
<HyperMuzzledFan> 02Err, still on vacatio n
<Mikey> I'm gonna reheat some dinner, brb
<Skylands> 10That's the thing, no one here started 'floof'
<Skylands> 10Seeing as it's a real definition
<drf|laptop> 03sorry my IRL friend is here so I'm gonna be idle
<Umbreon> 12rawr
<Ray> 02ok
<Umbreon> 12ok

<Skylands> 10It was merely brought here by an unidentified person at the moment
<Umbreon> 12i can
<Lambda> kk
*HyperMuzzledFan can make almost every sound ever made
<HyperMuzzledFan> 02!umbreon
*Umbreon still belongs to eXAKR for 6 more minutes
<Ray> 02:\ so, the origin of FLOOF is unknow?
<Umbreon> 12it is my understanding
<Umbreon> 12that hawkie was the one who started the floof thing
<Skylands> 10Pretty much
<Skylands> 10most creators remain anonymous
<Ray> 02hmm.. well that anonymous creator, earned my ethernal respect... he started a great fad :3
<HyperMuzzledFan> 02I think it's stupid now
<Skylands> 10It's not any different than to be fluffy, so eh
<HyperMuzzledFan> 02Must of been the vodka in my torillni....
<Ray> 02lol HML, that's one person who says that vs almost all TST
<HyperMuzzledFan> 02Or was it the vodka in the sauce...
<HyperMuzzledFan> 02Oh well, I'll like it in the morning

<Skylands> 10Did it say how much?
<HyperMuzzledFan> 02BRB, i'll check the list!
<Umbreon> 12doesn't matter
<Umbreon> 12the sauce was probably boiled\
<Umbreon> 12which evaporates all the alcohol
<Skylands> 10True, but I'm curious
*DoomCricket overthrows LaptopAristeo and installs himself as emperor of the network :P
<Lambda> Uh oh
<HyperMuzzledFan> 02The recipie was tripled
<Lambda> we're all doomed
<HyperMuzzledFan> 02So it's now 3 cups of Vodka

<Mikey> BATTLE OF DARCHOODS...:D
<Stormy> ...XDD
<Lambda> :D
<Lambda> Are they all really /that/ gullible?
<Lambda> or are they trollin'?
<Stormy> if they are then you're trollin' trolls
<Lambda> which is supposedly impossible
<silverspider101> well that is cool man i dont want to bother you.
<Lambda> I have acheived the impossible!
<Lambda> *achieved
<Stormy> And WTF
<Icydragon> 12So is ixr
<Stormy> why have they not activated my account yet??
<Stormy> Can it really take /that/ much time?
<Lambda> I pmed the admin asking him what's up
<Lambda> just now
<silverspider101> ok ok no need to become hostile here. :s
<Stormy> ...what just happened?
<Stormy> My computer screen blanked out and then came back on 5 times brighter than before
<Lambda> O.o
<ixr> Hostile is fun
<Lambda> graphics card updating?
<Stormy> lol
<Lambda> maybe
<Stormy> yeah right
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> not likeyl, I know
<silverspider101> well if you say so human.
<Lambda> *likely
<ixr> Hehe human huh?
<Stormy> I used to think SR knew what he was talking about and just believed whatever he said about computers without question
<Stormy> But I really don't think that's what's going on here. =/
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> I'm no SR
<Lambda> when I say stuff like that, I'm just speculating
<Stormy> Oh, I thought you were referencing that one time he said that
<Lambda> also when I said updating, I meant it was switching from the weaker one to the brighter one like it sometimes does
<Stormy> ....OK, and now it's back to normal
<Lambda> not outright patching itself
<Stormy> My computer is weird
<Lambda> though awesome
<Stormy> it's probably just becoming self-aware and trying to mess with me
<Lambda> D:
<Stormy> nothing to worry about
<Lambda> what do you mean "nothing to worry about"?
*Icydragon 12licks his dragoness
<Icydragon> 12Come now... we have important stuff to do.
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> that';s a whole lot to worry about
<Lambda> xP
<ixr> Sorry, we do
<Icydragon> 12Hehe ^.=.^
<Stormy> ksdjflsdjflasjdfadfs
<silverspider101> oh i understand ok goodbye
<Stormy> I just tried re-registering and it says my username has been taken
<Lambda> with the same username as last time you tried?
<Stormy> Yeah, it's taken, by me the first time I tried to register. -.-
<ixr> 4>)
<Icydragon> 12>;P
<Stormy> Oh well
<Stormy> lazy admin maybe?
<Lambda> seems that way
<Lambda> would you say so from how long you've been there Mikey?
<Stormy> both you and Neon have contacted them now?
<Lambda> I have, but he hasn't been online since then
<Lambda> and Neon said he did
<LizardGirl> niiiight all ^-^
<Lambda> night
<pinkdragoness234> im so happy cuz imma gummy bear gummy bear!!!
<ixr> .....
<Icydragon> 12FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUu
*Stormy is sick of lazy admins and hopes the admin of this site isn't one <.<
<Lambda> Mikey Mikey Mikey
<pinkdragoness234> Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
<Lambda> would you say this guy's lazy?
<Stormy> I think she's afk
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> well
<Lambda> I can assume from what we have seen that either
<Lambda> a) it's a lazy admin
<Lambda> or b) the site's new member system sucks and it didn't go through
<Stormy> which still implies lazy admin
<pinkdragoness234> YUP!
<Lambda> true
<Stormy> because you think they'd have figured it out by now and fixed it
<Lambda> since the site's been around since 2004
*Icydragon 12shoots himself
<ixr> So much for not wasting time on assholes like us
<pinkdragoness234> yup u talked 2 me first so ha!!! :P
<Stormy> I'm hoping it's just that they haven't been on the computer today
<Lambda> yeah
<Stormy> but that can't be, because why did yours go through then?
<pinkdragoness234> BITCH!!!
<Stormy> I registered before you
<ixr> Run like the little scared insect you are
<Lambda> maybe he came on but didn't have much time, and mine was the most recent request so he just got it out of the way quick
<Lambda> wich means lazy admin
<Lambda> *which
<Mikey> sorry going back and forth between computer and the house
<Mikey> only half the members end up getting accepted, I'm not sure why.
<Mikey> deane isn't very lazy though whenever I email him I get a reply within 15 minutes
<Mikey> I'll bring it up in the Mod Forum.
<Mikey> k I made a post in there, hopefully I'll get a reply back soon.
<LaptopAristeo> nini
<Lambda> night Aristeo
<Stormy> that is really weird
<Stormy> if a lot of people have that problem the forum might have double the members it does now
<Mikey> well I remember back in 07 when my cousin was registering it took him 2 times
<Mikey> yeahh
<Mikey> I think deane has the mod forum on alert and he's always around so hopefully he'll reply back in a bit
<Lambda> hopefully he can get this figured out
<Chimera> Meow

*Stormy actually read the word "union" as "onion" out loud once
<Lambda> haha, nice
<Mikey> so scourge's daughter is who we call "sooty", she says she's 20 but we all know she isn't, she's overly obsessed with cats, tries too hard to show that her interests are "dark" and is a wannabe mod, basically a hail with punctiation
<Mikey> so basically we dont like her
<Mikey> :P
<Lambda> lol
<Lambda> she a member there?
<Mikey> yep
<Mikey> I'm bored so I'll blab about all the members
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> AND SHE'S 20!
<Stormy> :P
<Mikey> ancientwinds is a n00b that tries too hard to not be optimistic, hate on everything that is happy, and expects all of the members to be excited and/or know about some book she's writing, but like all 12 year olds that "are writing a book" she's never ACTUALLY gonna finish.
<Mikey> and yeah sooty uses her age a lot to prove her points even though she's not really 20
<Lambda> I am totally right because I'm 20]
<Mikey> exactly.
<Lambda> you know what'd be funny?
<Drake> 04hi
<Mikey> koj09 is a 10 year old n00b that is very gullible and uses the word "[censored]" without knowing what it means
<Lambda> if she had been a member for four years and all four year's she's "been 20 years old"
<Lambda> *years
<Mikey> LMFAO no she joined in like 08 I think and she said she was "18" then
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> what word does koj use?
<Mikey> p u s s y
<Lambda> I can already tell he's gullible

<eXAKR> After watching these two videos, if you still love meat you are less than an organism.
*eXAKR hides
<Skylands> 10I'm not a big meat person, tbh
<eXAKR> I used to love meat
<Skylands> 10McDonald's ruined hamburgers for me
<eXAKR> But after seeing a roadshow where they showed how today's chickens grow unnaturally fast, I swore off it
<eXAKR> Then, that.

<eXAKR> Also, that
<Skylands> 10I haven't eaten that crap for many years
<Skylands> 10The stuff they put in the food is horrid, not to mention the food in general tastes appalling
<eXAKR> I hardly step into a fast food establishment nowadays
<Espeon> Skylands: Opinion
<Espeon> Sorry, but it's like a pet peeve of mine when people make it seem like they take it for granted that their opinion is the only right one xD
<Skylands> 10But that's what I was doing lol
<Espeon> The stuff they put in the food is horrid, not to mention the food in general tastes appalling
*Skylands doesn't see anyone going against her opinion at the moment anyway
<Espeon> but okay, just shows how much of a pet peeve of sorts it is to me xD
<Espeon> and I don't mind McDonalds at all, nothing more nor less so

<eXAKR> I will see how far I can go
<Skylands> 10Even the great Subway?
<eXAKR> I do still occasionally visit some
<eXAKR> Subway, Mos Burger, maybe yes
<eXAKR> Mos Burger has a Potato Patty burger which I can eat
<eXAKR> Subway has the Veggie Delight
<eXAKR> Then again, as I said, not often
<eXAKR> Their items are usually more expensive than food I can get elsewhere

<Rocket_Ninetales> Quick question...I'm out of work...should I wait until I find something I like or take a job I hate because I need the money to pay my bills?
<Rocket_Ninetales> I think the latter is best for now
<Rocket_Ninetales> and Hi HyperMuzzledLugia
<HyperMuzzledLugia> 02Hi
<HyperMuzzledLugia> 02<<
<Hawkie> 07Rocket_Ninetales
<Hawkie> 07I agree with you
<Hawkie> 07Besides
<Hawkie> 07Work experience.
<Rocket_Ninetales> Yeah just I end up either quitting or worse in those types of jobs
<Rocket_Ninetales> I'll just have to keep saying to myself it's for the money and I can find something better later lol
<Hawkie> 07Yeh.
<Hawkie> 07Honestly
<Rocket_Ninetales> I've got 4 years of work experience. I would go to uni but I can't pay the rent and bills with nothing
<Hawkie> 07Work fails like that I've noticed. And yeh...
<Rocket_Ninetales> yeah, I never should have left my good job but I needed to move up here to be with Burnett, and I don't regret that at all
<Hawkie> 07thing is if you're away from work too long people might be all 'and why weren't you working during that time' z.z and indeed.
<Rocket_Ninetales> I just wish I'd saved up a heck of a lot more
<Hawkie> 07I never said you did regret the move either
<Rocket_Ninetales> I always put on my CV 'looking for work which takes a lot of time'
<Rocket_Ninetales> I know :)
*Hawkie nods ^^
<Hawkie> 07I'm so proud of you RN.
<Hawkie> 07No seriously, your dedication to finding work and such.
<Rocket_Ninetales> I'm not going to volunteer because it means working for nothing and less time to look for work....I would volunteer if I had a job and spare time though. And thanks but I've been feeling really down being out of work again.
<Rocket_Ninetales> Yeah my dedication comes from needing the money/wanting to have spare money to go shopping, I'll get there in the end. I've got a christmas temp job 22nd Nov - 22nd Dec doing night shifts which suits me fine
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Well, good luck with you temp job
*Hawkie nods.
<Hawkie> 07RN I'm still proud of you though, even though it seems really difficult for ya.
<Hawkie> 07I can't say I've ever experienced the same but honestly, yeh.
<Rocket_Ninetales> Thanks...something will come along, I send loads of applications off per day. :) I really want to work in a school office as I find that kind of thing interesting/and the long holidays would be cool. I'm a bit disheartened at working for law firms now because they do redundancies a lot
<Hawkie> 07Redundancies?
<Hawkie> 07can you explain?=
<Rocket_Ninetales> I left college early because I was sick of never having any money...don't follow my example xD as I ended up in a poorly paid job and still no money. But a few years later I was in very good jobs.
<Rocket_Ninetales> Yeah every law firm I have worked in has laid people off because they're in financial difficulty...like the one I had just now.
<Rocket_Ninetales> I left some of the law firms though to move.
<Rocket_Ninetales> Anyway I'm not whining :) I won't talk about jobs much more today haha
<Hawkie> 07Back
<Hawkie> 07Just uploaded some photos on facebook x3;
<Hawkie> 07and Rocket_Ninetales, I never said you were whining. You're having a positive attitude and that I like/respect M>
<Hawkie> 07*;>
<Hawkie> 07but yeah. Good luck.
<Rocket_Ninetales> Yeah I just thought I was, lol.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02XD
*Hawkie huggles Rocket_Ninetales^^
<Hawkie> 07How is life with Burnett?
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Perserver mah Ninetails, and yoou will have success
<Rocket_Ninetales> It's good thanks ^^
<Rocket_Ninetales> Got to go for a bit, back later!

<Chimera> The eBook rip works perfectly
<Lambda> XD at your reply to Stormy's welcome thread
<LaptopAristeo> :3
<Chimera> I can read it in School now thanks to iBooks :3
<Neon> WOT
<Neon> Yeah, haha. Hey.
<Ray> 02Apple did a good thing?
<Chimera> Apparently
<Chimera> See
<Chimera> You can download .pdf files
<Chimera> Free
<Stormy> Hahaha
<Chimera> Off the internet
<Chimera> XD
<Chimera> But
*Stormy wonders if they're /still/ actually buying this
<Chimera> Since I respect Rick Riordan
<Chimera> I'll buy all his other books
<Ray> 02:3
<Lambda> AncientWinds posted the EXACT same greeting to you as she did to me
<Chimera> I just CAN'T FIND this ONE book!
<Lambda> typos and all
<Chimera> So I'll "rent" it |P
<Neon> It's weird. The Gwendolyn chick keeps saying she's some kind of academic genius, yet she was gullible enough to think we all knew each other through war...
*Chimera flees
<Lambda> Hahahahaha
<Neon> But we've gone all out with the fantasy, so I doubt any of dim enough to believe now.
<Lu> nn -_-
<Lambda> a war that ended years before any of us were born
<Neon> *are dim
<Neon> Yeah, XD
<Neon> The same exact post, basically.
<Stormy> And the war of Darchoods and purple dragons
<Neon> I corrected her spelling of liar.
<Lambda> XD yeah
<Lambda> if anyone asks
<Stormy> I wasn't even trying to troll I thought it was so obviously a joke
<Lambda> the Purple Dragons were our code name for the Viet Cong :P
<Neon> It is.
<Neon> Not our fault for being fooled.
<Neon> *them being fooled
<Lambda> lol yeah
<Lambda> we were clearly joking
<Lambda> if they believe it then they are just outright gullible
<Lambda> Dude
<Lambda> Neon
<Kipi> *belch*
<Neon> Yes?
<Lambda> you completed my LOTR quote
<Lambda> I cannot believe it
<HyperMetalLugia> 02XD
<Lambda> XD
<Neon> Well, the part before it anyway.
<Lambda> http://www.owlpages.info/fantasy/viewtopic.php?p=122381#122381
<Lambda> of true
<Ray> 02hi again kipi :3
<Lambda> so out of order
<Kipi> Hullo, Sir Ray.
*Neon nods.
<Neon> I've evolved into a jerk.
<Lambda> Haha
<Lambda> nice
<Lambda> and a mod oddly enough
<Neon> It goes hadn in hand.
<Neon> *hand
<Lambda> lol
<Neon> AW is so irritating.
<Neon> I feel the need to smite her.
<Neon> Although she does say "WOT" a lot, ironically.
<Lambda> haha
<Mikey> I hate aw shes a dumb [censored] I think I'll take her precious [censored]ing book and shove it up her [censored]ing ass
<Mikey> just
<Mikey> [censored]
<Mikey> [censored] her
<Neon> I'm just going to respond with Captain soon.
<Neon> Mikey, I barely know her.
<Neon> And she's 12.
<Mikey> so?
<Mikey> she's a dumb[censored]
<Neon> Too young for me.
<Neon> xD
<Mikey> ah.
<Mikey> not in a laughing mood sorry.
<Neon> Nah.
<Neon> But she's done nothing wrong, technically.
<Mikey> she still irritates the [censored] out of me
<Neon> Can't even muscle my way in with bias to get her in trouble.
<Chimera> Burpy kippeh
<HyperMetalLugia> 02WB
<Neon> Lambda: WIN.

<Ray> 02anyway seya again in other time
<Lambda> what do you think of the new avatar?
<Lambda> it's myself drawn in the style of the Scott Pilgrim comics
<Lambda> I made one of Stormy too
<Neon> I'm not sure of its origin, but it's noice.
<Chimera> Lolwow
<Neon> My friend rubbed off Caps Lock from his keyboard and wrote Billy Mays in its place.
<Chimera> Apple made a brightness slider for iBooks
<Lambda> hahaha
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Sounds like a 3D slider
<Chimera> But they prevent other apps from modifying brightness
<Chimera> SO USEFUL >_>
<Chimera> what
<Chimera> No it doesn't
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Oh well, a slider is a slider
<Neon> Well, I have to retire for the night.
<Chimera> I respect Thaila now

<Lu> and we were there with like 100 other men all in a big grassy park type thing
<Lu> and we were setting up camp or something
<LaptopAristeo> >.<
<Lu> and all I really remember was when the plane was coming
<Lu> and there was a little bomb and we were all running for cover
<NodFanatic> hoi burd :D
<Lu> and we started heading for the one really tall tree
<Lu> and then I hit the deck and felt this blast wave
<Lu> and I looked back and my friend's leg was gone and his guts were all over
<Lu> it was soooo gorey
<Lu> gory
<LaptopAristeo> >.<

<Irene> 07also
<Irene> 07hi

<Xeeshu> How do you know the name ?
<Curly> see? a bong with a tube sticking out of it :O
<Aurora> 6:>
<Xeeshu> Yeah, Yeah... :)
<Curly> I'm pretty sure my neighbours have a hookah on their patio
<Curly> it's either that or a beer dispenser thingy *isn't sure*
<Xeeshu> patio?
<Kipikipo> 'w' Speakin' of Aurora's face.
<Kipikipo> Time for math
<Curly> um, it's like an oversized balcony that people usually put picnic tables and stuff on
<Kipikipo> Farewell, Sky Templars~
<Irene> 07Byes!
<Curly> or at least
<Curly> that's what I call a patio xD
<Xeeshu> mhm
*Curly looked up patio on wikipedia and is a bit confused now
<Cat> A patio is like a raised flat paved area, isn't it?
*LaptopAristeo has to go to speak to the freshmen now
<Curly> that's what I thought
<LaptopAristeo> I'll bbl :3
<Curly> according to Wikipedia a patio is like a backyard though...
<Curly> bye Ari o/
<LaptopAristeo> byeee o/
<Cat> so it's a paved area used for dining
<Curly> I always called patios the balcony type thing at the back of a house >.>
<Cat> isn't that a porch?
<Cat> or a veranda
<Curly> is it? I thought porches were lower down and were made for like benches and stuff
<Cat> a veranda is like a ground floor balcony type thing
<Xeeshu> Curly: you've made me confused too.. <.<
<Curly> yeah, I was right, a porch is at the front of the house
<Xeeshu> :S
<Xeeshu> so whats a patio?
<Cat> a paved area used for dining
<Curly> http://www.schaeferfan.com/images/ZC-Z12-horiz.patio.w.jpg
<Cat> without a roof
<Curly> isn't that a patio?
<Cat> i don't think it is
<Andres> Silly crashes D:
<Curly> what is it then? O_o
<Cat> a deck?
<Cat> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck_%28building%29
<Curly> oh
<Andres> What did I miss? :3
<Curly> I guess it is a deck then... I think
<Irene> 07ROFL
<Irene> 07this fails
*Curly is pretty sure people call decks patios too though... >.>
<Cat> I think the main difference is that patios have stone floor, and decks have wooden floor
<Cat> and decks are usually raised off the ground
<Espeon> yes
<Andres> D: People still refuse to tell me what I missed :(
<Curly> you didn't miss much
<Andres> If I had a mansion, I would want the middle to be a greenhouse practically D:
<Curly> just us talking about patios/decks/porches >.>
<Andres> That'd be awesomeish ^^
<Curly> why the middle? O:
<Andres> So I could have an oak in the middle of the house
<Curly> I don't think oaks need to grow in a greenhouse >.>
<Light_Latias> 12blah
<Light_Latias> 12g2g v-v
<Light_Latias> 12BBL tonight~
*Curly is pretty sure a greenhouse would be too hot for an oak tree
<Andres> Myes, but I would like it to be warm there year-around D:
<Irene> 07Espeon
<Irene> 07so like
<Irene> 07My classnmate used
<Irene> 07the computer
<Irene> 07to log into the school website
<Curly> put a big sauna somewhere in your house then O:
<Irene> 07he accidentally wrote his password into the username field
<Irene> 07and it autosaved
<Irene> 07LOL
<Irene> 07so now I know his password z.z
<Curly> or a steam room if you want it humid
<Irene> 07its very random LOL!
*Andres practically just meant a garden with a roof on it :3
<Curly> oh
<Curly> nevermind me then >.>;
<Andres> Glass roof of course :o
<Espeon> lol o.o
<Andres> Air conditioning would be required in the winter and the summer D:
*Maser is eating popcorn.
*Maser knows he will pay for it later with gas.
<Andres> Or I would just not need a roof if it was in somewhere like California or sumtin warm like that.
<Irene> 07yeah
<Irene> 07LOL
<Curly> is it sunny where you live a lot of the time?
<Andres> Yeah
<Andres> And windy enough for the forest to keep losing trees.
<Curly> okays, I was just wondering, because a glass roof would get really cold if there wasn't sunlight >.>
<Steve> 12,7Hail Steve, the fabled Englushmen *Awesomesauce*

<Umbreon> 12Irene need me?
<Irene> 07Yes
<Irene> 07what is terminal velocity
<Umbreon> 12it sounds... familiar
<Umbreon> !define terminal velocity
<Umbreon> 12lol no tst bot?
<Umbreon> 12the constant maximum velocity reached by a body falling through the atmosphere under the attraction of gravity
<Irene> 07which means?
<Umbreon> 12velocity.... hmm
<Umbreon> 12i believe is speed
<drf|laptop> 03I totally just woke up
<Umbreon> 12drf is an expert ask him

<Umbreon> 12eep
<Umbreon> 12noooo
<Chimera> And um
<Chimera> Terminal Velocity
<Angel_Espeon> 13Isn't terminal velocity something like the maximum speed that something reaches when it's falling, when the kinetic energy converts into sound and heat energy?

<Angel_Espeon> 13or am I thinking of something else
<Chimera> That's like, the maximum speed of an object when falling
<Chimera> It won't get any faster
<Chimera> Actually it's not really speed
<Chimera> Velocity is like, speed x distance...?

<Rocket_Ninetales> LOL on facebook "Anyone know a very easy pumpkin pie recipe?" Me: "Yeah, buy it from the shop"
<Aurora> 6OMG PUMPKIN PIE
<Aurora> 6I looooove it
<Rocket_Ninetales> I've never had it
<Rocket_Ninetales> the pumpkins are too hard to dig out and carve
<Rocket_Ninetales> but I'd try it :) they might sell them down the supermarket
<Aurora> 6well
<Aurora> 6I buy them from the market too
<Aurora> 6so
<Aurora> 6|D
<Aurora> 6my friend and I bought a full one last year and split it between us
<Aurora> 6best pie ever, gonna go back to that store this year
<Rocket_Ninetales> nice! I've never tasted it, I'll have to some time
<Aurora> 6I was so full after though ._.
<Rocket_Ninetales> I was always told by people that pumpkin pie doesn't taste of anything, strange
<Aurora> 6...nah, it definitely has a taste
<Aurora> 6and it's sooo goood
<drf|laptop> 03back
<drf|laptop> 03also LOL
<drf|laptop> 03this reminds me of
<drf|laptop> 03a few years ago
<drf|laptop> 03my mom had heard from a few people that Meijer had the best pumpkin pies ever, better than home made ones
<drf|laptop> 03(Meijer is a local superstore chain)
<Rocket_Ninetales> I'll have to try it - I can't cook much so I'll see if they sell good ones at the shops.
<drf|laptop> 03so she bought one, and she made one herself, then didn't tell us which is which
<drf|laptop> 03and we had a slice of each
<drf|laptop> 03and we all basically said we liked the Meijer one better than hers XD
<Chimera> Meow
<Rocket_Ninetales> haha
<Aurora> 6lol
<Rocket_Ninetales> See I'd look which one she handled carefully, that's the homemade one xD people always do that
<Rocket_Ninetales> cos they know theirs might break into bits
<Chimera> Wow drf

<Curly> molasses is chewy?
<Curly> I thought molasses was like honey
<Curly> thick and goopy
<DarkTruth> little thicker
<Proto> I figured by being really thick it would be inherently chewy.
<Curly> if it doesn't stick in your teeth it's not chewy :O
<DarkTruth> try shoe fly pie sometime
<DarkTruth> wanna talk about thick and kinda chewy

<sally> :D

<Andres> Oh, that.
<sally> it's ok Cat :p.
<Andres> Cat, do you have an awesome idea for on what day to make regular blog posts? ^^
<sally> every wednesday
<Andres> I have about 30 interiors to bloggify
<Andres> Okies!
<sally> :D
<Andres> 30?
<Andres> I meant 60 D.
<Andres> Thewhat
<Andres> What order to use? :o
<Andres> From newest to oldest?
<Irene> 07fff
<Lu> oldest first
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Hi TG and irene
<Andres> D:
<Andres> But that would cut in to the flow :o
<Lu> huh?
<Lyrit> 12Who, the guy with the twitchy ear? Nope! I was just thinking... You're really good friends!
<Lyrit> 12ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
<Lyrit> 12Why don't you love me Yun whyyyyy
<Lyrit> 12;v;
<HyperMetalLugia> 02What?
<Lyrit> 12VDex.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Fangirls....
<Andres> I already have 5 posts, it would be easier to flow backwards from the first one that I did post.
<Lyrit> 12:|
<Lyrit> 12I'm trying to max him out to get Mewtwo.
<Lu> but beginning at the oldest ones gives a background to build from, and then you can explain design decisions that were based on earlier posts
<Lu> plus, they would appear to be evolving as you kept on blogging
<Andres> But they are all unrelated to eachother :o
<Lu> but your mind was the link all along
<Andres> But, I suppose I can start from the beginning and such.
<Lu> Andres, your MIND was the relatino
<Lu> on
<Andres> Not really, it is seriously inconsistent.
<Andres> But I suppose the interiors that were made before I lost my mind might have slight relations...
<Lu> huh.. well I have no idea what you're talking about, so why not do themes instead?
<Lu> like, this week is "purple" day
<Lu> or some such things
<Andres> http://andresindoril.blogspot.com/
<Lu> are you like, an architect?
<Andres> Modder
<Lu> oh cool

<Lu> LaptopAristeo, are onions yuckie compared to onion powder?
<sally> who would use such a groudy gross blehness
<LaptopAristeo> Onions are nice if used correctly, unless sally says otherwise, and if she does, then whatever sally says is true and overrides whatever I just said
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Hmm..

<Lu> well, dang.
*sally likes it
<Lyrit> 12No.

<Quanyails> 7Eh?
<Quanyails> 7Why?
<sally> :o i can eat the onions from panda express only Lu
<Lu> Cat, the flavor is cooked out a bit, so it's a nice mellow flavor isn't it
<sally> those are sauted and stuff :3
<Aeroslash> hi Quan
<Lyrit> 12How about
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Aero.
<Lyrit> 12I don't want to.
<Reed> good reason...
<Lu> sally, I've heard onions could be sautéed, but I've never seen it anywhere before O_O
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Hi Quan
<sally> NOWAY
<sally> wtf, you poor deprived man.
<Reed> I don't want to be left out so
<Quanyails> 7Lyrit; so you'd retort harshly? Will I suppose you are not a fangirl, or perhaps, until later?
<Lu> sally, I wonder if they can be cut up so I'm not biting into the skins and stems and stuff
*Stryker hugs LaptopAristeo.
<Reed> hi Quan
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Reed.
<Quanyails> 7I will be busy.
<LaptopAristeo> ^^
<sally> of course
<Lyrit> 12How is that harsh.
<Andres> Should I make two blogposts tomorrow? D:
<Lyrit> 12I could've said it a lot harsher.
<Armageddon> o-o
<Quanyails> 7Or frank.
<Cat> I have some wensleydale cheese, and am considering eating some :O
<sally> dude, Lu..you are missing out.
<Quanyails> 7Harsh does not have to equal mean.
*Armageddon sneezes
<Lu> yeah, I wonder if maybe there are different kinds of onions with dramatically different flavors too,.
<sally> there are a couple
<sally> not alot, alot.
<sally> purple onions i can handle.
<Lu> dang, I'll never get to be a good cook at this rate T_T
<sally> heh
<Andres> Cooking is for boobed ones!
<Cat> curry powder improves a lot of thing
<Cat> *things
*Andres is being silly of course.
*Lu cries and cries and cries, and wonders where all these onions came from
<Skylands> 10TR, what's with all the clones?
<Lu> Cat, curry is a mixture of like 100 spices isn't it?
<Baltaire> Idk
<sally> <______<
<Lu> Cat, I'm thinking there are numerous variety of said powder in powdered form
*sally throws stuff at Andres then hugs him for just being silly
<Baltaire> I exit out for one sec
<Andres> I can't make pancakes, but I can make some mean chicken and rice >:3
<Lu> Andres, that'll do.
<Cat> I have a thing of hot curry powder next to me
<Baltaire> and now there is reeds everywhere!
<Cat> I shall find out what is in it
<Cat> I'm guessing a lot
<HyperHungryLugia> 02WB DRF
<Andres> What'll do? D:
*Andres hugs back.
<Skylands> 10Exit out, what do you mean exactly?
<Cat> Coriander, cumin seed, ginger, salt, fenugreek, garlic powder, chilli powder, cinnamon, pepper, paprika, bay leaf, cardamom and caraway seed
<Cat> yum
<Baltaire> I got of mirc
<Baltaire> off*
<Skylands> 10Did you exit the program, or minimize?
<Baltaire> minimize
<Andres> I need to find the lyrics to this songthing that I do not particullary like, but keeps being played on this radio station :/
<Skylands> 10o.o
<Baltaire> i'm guessing that is the problem?
<Lu> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry_powder
<sally> why Andres?
<Skylands> 10Probably
<Baltaire> so now what?
<Skylands> 10I'll ask my friend, who's an expert at mIRC
<Baltaire> ok

<Light_Latias> 12...
<HyperMetalLugia> 02FTW
<theguesst> I was riding my usual route to my home after about 1 hour and 30 minutes of biking. All of a sudden an unknown object passed by me and missed me by an inch. I went back to check what it was and it happened to be what I believe was an apple. It was too dark to tell really as I've never been riding this late before.
<Skylands> 10When you open your browser, what does the icon say, TR?
<Lyrit> 12TR
<Lyrit> 12those are my initials.

<Lyrit> 12e thing
<Lyrit> 12it's lower case.
*HyperMetalLugia runs around and geekrants
<theguesst> A few blocks later after ignoring the apple as a freak accident by another person I reached a main street where I turn into a suburban neighborhood where I live. Another one was thrown and missed me again by an even shorter amount. There was one car that passed me who had slowed down as to guess my next move. In a panic I took a turn into a street and doubled back at an unusual speed...
<theguesst> ...where I skinned my knee.
<TR_Reed> oh its an e
<TR_Reed> XD
<Lyrit> 12Then
<HyperMetalLugia> 02FAIL'

<HyperMetalLugia> 02Yup
<TR_Reed> didnt know that is what you meant
<TR_Reed> epic fail
<TR_Reed> so now what?
<theguesst> From there I realized my chain was broken and tried to hide in a ditch where I tried to fix my chain un-noticed . When That failed as I was in a state of shock I flagged down a friendly bystander to help fix it and watch for any more projectiles or the assaulting vehicle.
<Irene> 07The biggest chat-killer was drfsupercenter whose final comment caused the sudden end of 11 conversations.
<Irene> 07Following sample line ended a 6-minute conversation and was followed by 6 minutes of silence:

<theguesst> I managed to get home from there where I then took a shower to wash some of the blood of my knee. Afterwords I was patched up and that knee keeps reminding me of the terror and pain I felt 2 days ago
<Skylands> 10Did you ever catch who this person was, Theguesst?
<theguesst> No I did not
<Skylands> 10Personally, I would call the police to scan that area
<Skylands> 10Especially if it happens again someday
<Sneas> 3E:3
<theguesst> That just added to my weekly regiment of stress and panic which lead to another depression case for the week

<drfsupercenter> 03A blonde walks into a bank in New York City and asks for the Loan officer.
<drfsupercenter> 03She says she's going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000.
<drfsupercenter> 03The bank officer says the bank will need some kind Of security for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to a new Mercedes Benz SL 500.
<drfsupercenter> 03The car is parked on the street in front of the bank, she has the title and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car collateral for the loan.
<drfsupercenter> 03The bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at The blond for using a $110,000 Benz as collateral against a $5,000 loan.
<drfsupercenter> 03An employee of the bank then proceeds to drive the Benz into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns, repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41.
<drfsupercenter> 03The loan officer says, "Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire.
<drfsupercenter> 03What puzzles us is, why would you bother to borrow $5,000?"
<drfsupercenter> 03The blonde replies, "Where else in New York City can I park my Car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?"
<drfsupercenter> 03Finally... a smart blonde joke.

*Damos hugs the Espeon Gently and gives it a cookie

<Rocket_Ninetales> Hi again all
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Hi RN
<TR_Reed> hi RN
<Prince-dari> Hey. Mikey.
<Mikey> hay
<Mikey> what's up
*CootieMonster wonders why she's still CootieMonster
<Prince-dari> I just saw some trailer for an owl movie. Is it based around a series of books that you've read?
<Prince-dari> Can't remember what you said they were called.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02BRB Dinner
<Mikey> Legend of the Guardians? yup
<Mikey> I think it just came out in theatres over there, it came out here at the end of september
*Mikey has seen it 3 times so far :D
<Prince-dari> Lol. Well at least we get HP first. :P
<Mikey> I've never read HP or seen any movies so XD
<TR_Reed> bye eat well
<Prince-dari> That's pretty shocking, most people I talk to in the UK have seen all the films and read at least some of the books.
<Mikey> yeah I'm the only person that's never seen or read any of them I bet :P
<Rocket_Ninetales> Don't eat a well, it'll hurt your teeth :/
*Damos gives the Hungery Lugia a fish
<Mikey> not the only, but you get my point
<Damos> 13and a cookie
<Rocket_Ninetales> and a watermelon
<Prince-dari> Yeah, I know what you mean. XD
<Irene> 07Rocket_Ninetales!
<Rocket_Ninetales> Irene!
<Rocket_Ninetales> xD
<Irene> 07How are YOU
<Rocket_Ninetales> Oh no you've just reminded me of my nosey neighbour Irene with the telescope again xD and I'm fine thanks!
*Quanyails 7needs help. o3o
<Irene> 07Oh telescope?
<Rocket_Ninetales> Help with what?
<Irene> 07and good^^
<Quanyails> 7File types.
<Quanyails> 7In the mass of a soundtrack, there's one file which isn't opening properly.
<Rocket_Ninetales> What type is it?
<Quanyails> 7It's supposed to be an MP3, but..
<Rocket_Ninetales> Sometimes it's a WMA and people have just typed mp3 to the end of it
<Rocket_Ninetales> I've had that problem, but it might not be that.
<LaptopAristeo> Curly!
<Curly> Ari O:
<LaptopAristeo> :D
<Quanyails> 7How do I change the file type?
<Rocket_Ninetales> I usually use a sound file convertor but there may be other ways
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL you can't just type something at the end RN
<drfsupercenter> 03that doesn't actually work
<drfsupercenter> 03What type of file is it Quany?
<Damos> 13actually you can
<Damos> 13like this
<drfsupercenter> 03no...
<Damos> 13I like pie.
*Damos runs
<drfsupercenter> 03that doesn't change the filetype
<Rocket_Ninetales> lol ok xD but I have had that problem before where it's been reading as an MP3 file but is actually a WMA file
<Rocket_Ninetales> No I meant people just type it on the end and make other people think it's an MP3 when it isn't
<Quanyails> 7DRF; it's supposed to be an MP3.
<HyperHungryLugia> 02Back
<drfsupercenter> 03but what type is it?
<HyperHungryLugia> 02Thanks for the cookies and watermelons
<HyperHungryLugia> 02And a fish
<Rocket_Ninetales> What I meant is, there's a possibility it's a WMA which someone has just typed .mp3 at the end and people think it's a MP3, not that it changed the file type :) sometimes that has happened to me
<Quanyails> 7No, I mean, it's an MP3.
<Rocket_Ninetales> wb
<Quanyails> 7But it's not opening.
<drfsupercenter> 03then it's probably corrupted
<Rocket_Ninetales> ok fair enough, different problem to mine then
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Light_Latias03)02WB* - LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINK!

*Damos give LLy a gentle hug
<Damos> 13and a cookie
<drfsupercenter> 03um.
<drfsupercenter> 03The fact that it's 18KB
*Light_Latias huggles back gently and noms?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm going to take a guess and say that's not a valid file.
<drfsupercenter> 03It probably didn't download all the way.
<Rocket_Ninetales> That's like when a torrent that should be 1GB is 18mb and you just know it's a virus or not uploaded properly xD
<Quanyails> 7Hrm. Let's see, the original file's supposed to be 3.03MB...
<Quanyails> 7The link given had to be adjusted, as it had one too many spaces...
<Quanyails> 7And the download itself was cut short. O_o
<drfsupercenter> 03gimme the link then
<Light_Latias> 12Liiiiink
<Quanyails> 7Well, the improper link...
<Quanyails> 7I'll PM you it.
<Quanyails> 7Nothing bad, just fangirlistic. Sorta.
<Rocket_Ninetales> I've got to go now guys, bye, hope you get your file sorted, Quan.

<Cat> I saw my 22" monitor in a high street shop once
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Enemy
<DarkTruth> I just bought my parents a Dyson vacuum
<Cat> it was £40 more than I got it for from an online store D:
<Curly> I want a dyson O:
<DarkTruth> $400 regularly I got it for $232
<Cat> high street stores are so not good
<DarkTruth> with all my discounts ;P
<Curly> yeah, but online shopping has huge shipping prices for me ):
<DarkTruth> yea that sucks
<DarkTruth> brb
<Cat> don't they do free shipping over a certain price?
<Ray|Brawl> 02Hi FEAAAAAAAAAATHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRR
<Cat> for me it's over £50 with Novatech
<Cat> which is nice
<Curly> well
<Proto> All the things I like cost uber$ to ship. :<
<Curly> it wasn't with the laptop I was looking at
<Curly> it was like $100 of shipping -_-
<Cat> srs? ow
<HyperMetalLugia> 02LOL
<Curly> that included a bag though
<Curly> you should see the shipping of *watches* on Ebay to Canada
<Curly> $40 shipping
<Cat> isn't there some local canadian firm that ships the parts to you for cheap?
<Curly> for a watch!
<Proto> There's an engraver I'd like, found out about it from a friend, $655 for the cutter/engraver.
<Curly> maybes. I haven't really looked into it that far Cat
<Espeon> Ray used roar
<Kipi> owo
<Cat> I had to pay £1.24 for the cheapest shipping for a cd the other week
*Curly hasn't exactly kept up with things since she gave up on buying a new computer
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Ray used Angryface
<Proto> $300 for the shipping, or was it $600 for the cutter, $355 for the shipping? Either way, at least $300 shipping. ._.
<Cat> the cd itself cost about 40p D:
<Cat> used on amazon
<Curly> how big is a cutter/engraver?
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Feather03)02WB* - <Feather> 10Kiddyland :D
<Proto> Ehm...this one isn't that big, but it's probably insured shipping.
<Proto> Thin glass tube and whatnot.
<Curly> how big is not that big? <.<
<Proto> Can fit on a desk.
*Espeon tactically sits on Kipi
<Cat> Noel Fielding comes on wearing a cape or poncho or something! o.O
<Proto> And smaller than my friends' schools' Universal VLS.
<Cat> "oh bristol you... cheeky little otters, how are you??"
<Kipi> meep ._.
*Kipi squirms under Espeon
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Chimera> Hi
<Cat> he's such a strange guy
<Cat> :D
<Espeon> meepkipi
*HyperMetalLugia lies on Kipi too
<Espeon> oh well
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Fuzzy
<Chimera> RP left
<Curly> otters are adorable <3
<Espeon> fuzzy indeed
<Chimera> I cannot be kitty hat
<Chimera> :~
<Chimera> :<
<Curly> they're like sea kittens!
<Curly> not the PETA approved version >.>
<HyperMetalLugia> 02http://punditkitchen.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/49c4f55c-25e8-4b76-a322-08a42fbe57f6.jpg
<Chimera> And what is this about fuzzy Kipi
<HyperMetalLugia> 02So that's where they come from...
<Proto> PETA can gdiaf.
<Cat> eww, peta
<Cat> they are smelly
<Proto> One of their top members is a diabetic, yet is opposed to using animals to test medicines.
*Curly has no opinion about the PETA but thinks sea kittens is dumb
<Proto> How's that insulin, hipocrite?
<Proto> Heh.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Espie sat on him
<Chimera> Lol Bramuda Triangle
<HyperMetalLugia> 02LOL What, where?
<Curly> they test insulin on animals?
<Proto> Their leader, that creepy woman, called a terrorist a fine young man.
*Kipi waves to Chimera.
<Proto> I think they did when they first developed it.
<Chimera> Kipi
<Chimera> :3
*HyperMetalLugia hides Kipi under him
<Kipi> Yuush?
*Curly still has no opinion on the PETA
<Curly> all I know is that their campaigns are a bit weird
<Curly> although if they're aiming for attention they've got it
<Roleplay4life> 5Hi peoples~
<Proto> What about supporting a group that breaks into animal labs, destroys them, sets fires to them and spray paints their slogans all over the place?
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Hi RP
<Espeon> Hi (again oo3)
<Proto> Because they've done that.
<Roleplay4life> 5 8D
<Curly> sometimes I feel kind of like that's necessary
<Curly> sometimes
<Curly> it depends though
<Roleplay4life> 5I actually was hoping to ask Aurora a quick question, but I'll wait 'til she comes in..
<LaptopAristeo> :3
<Roleplay4life> 5So how're you two?
<LaptopAristeo> I don't know things about PETA
<Kyu> 07she's here o3o
<Aurora> ?
<Curly> me neither
<Espeon> Tired rtololol
<Aurora> well
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh huh. xD I thought maybe you were busy.
<Aurora> I need to leave really soon
<Aurora> like
<Aurora> 2 minutes
<Aurora> so hurry?
<Cat> insulin is cultured from bacteria nowadays
<Cat> D:
<LaptopAristeo> But I do know that if people didn't eat animals, there would be less animals, so therefore, boycotting the consumption of meat means that you're preventing animals the opportunity to live
<Curly> I'd totally have broken into the lab of the guy who did the pit of despair experiments and set it on fire though >.>
<Roleplay4life> 5Okay, um, in DRP, what's the reference to "the rocky outcropping" and "Konek" that Cygnus makes?
<Proto> Yeah, their leader called a terrorist a fine young man, he's admitted to starting like seven fires and been charged with arson twice, is all I
<Proto> 'm saying.*
<Aurora> um
<Cat> it used to be made by taking pig's pancreases and crushing them up and extracting it from that
<Curly> that doesn't exactly mean anything
<Roleplay4life> 5Like, i just didn't understand that. o-o
<Aurora> the rocky outcropping is the rocky outcropping I made up in one of my posts
<Aurora> where konek, his employer, is waiting
<Curly> the United States started as "terrorists" too
<LaptopAristeo> yep ^^
<Roleplay4life> 5Where is it in relation to where the fight is?
<Aurora> um
<LaptopAristeo> Our founders were terrorists <3
<Aurora> it's where cygnus is flying
<Aurora> so
<Aurora> dead ahead
<Roleplay4life> 5(Drevnij is basically useless right now and I want to drag him into a fight or something lol.)
<Proto> Yes, but we didn't burn down animal testing labs.
<Curly> most countries started that way >.>
<Roleplay4life> 5Thus why I haven't posted yet.
<Aurora> ok well
<Proto> I think that we should respect Finland way more than we do.
<Aurora> thrush has an insect on his back
<Roleplay4life> 5I'll send him after Cygnus?
<LaptopAristeo> Curly: You're supposed to call them freedom fighters though
<Aurora> squish it
<Roleplay4life> 5Ohhh right~ 8D I can work with that.
<Aurora> now
<Aurora> I'm gonna go to work
<Curly> generally any group that calls themselves freedom fighters are just as bad as everyone else >.>
<Roleplay4life> 5Bye~
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Huh... girls and ther DRPs...
<Roleplay4life> 5 /late lol
*Curly eyes the "freedom fighters" in Africa
<Roleplay4life> 5It's fun!
<Curly> who knows though
*HyperMetalLugia rolls his shiny eyes
<HyperMetalLugia> 02-shiny
<Curly> maybe those freedom fighters will start up the next USA
<Curly> the United States of Africa >.>
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Shiny is bad
<Roleplay4life> 5Besides, my name here IS kind of RP4L... thus I would join the most popular roleplay on TST, yes?
<HyperMetalLugia> 02OF COURSE
<Roleplay4life> 5It's only /logical/.
<Proto> Meh, I ain't too fond of the United States of Amurikuh.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02So is your IRL name Christie...?
<Proto> I would *so* love seccession.
<Curly> seccession from what?
<Cat> the united states of antarctica!
<Cat> :D
<Proto> The North.
<Roleplay4life> 5Christine? Um, well it's the name I go by on the internet.
<Curly> oh okays
<LaptopAristeo> The USA actually had a pretty nice revolution -- it was peaceful and principled and we got so lucky to have the leadership that we had
<Roleplay4life> 5But no, it's not the name on my birth certificate. ;P
<HyperMetalLugia> 02You sound like a christie...
<LaptopAristeo> George Washington actually had a lot of people encouraging him to become a dictator among his army
<Curly> wasn't the civil war one of the bloodiest wars in history?
<LaptopAristeo> And he was in a position to do so
<Roleplay4life> 5Uh, well I'm not. x3;
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Even though I haven't met any
<DarkTruth> ok I am back
<Curly> welcome back ^^
<Proto> Curly, heh, yeah.
<Roleplay4life> 5I have. And they're nothing like me.
<Proto> Over 600,000 men died.
<Curly> you're just in time for history class!
<Proto> Every single one an American.
<LaptopAristeo> Curly: WWII had more people killed than the Civil War had people alive
<Curly> I knows
<Roleplay4life> 5Welcome back StarlitDusk. 8D
<LaptopAristeo> Millions and millions died in WWII
<Proto> She didn't say THE bloodeist.
<StarlitDusk> 12 8D
<Proto> She said ONE of.
<Curly> but that doesn't cross the Civil War out as one of the bloodiest wars in history
<StarlitDusk> 12Homework... dune
<StarlitDusk> 12done
<StarlitDusk> 12hai rp4l
<Curly> somewhere on the top 20 list I think
<Proto> But seriously, guys, what are we going to do if Finland attacks?!
<LaptopAristeo> The US hasn't had that many wars
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Oh Hi Starlitzone
<LaptopAristeo> I really think we need to disband like 90% of the US military tbh
<Curly> I was just poking at the "peaceful and principled" bit
<LaptopAristeo> I don't like what we've become
<StarlitDusk> 12hello HML
<StarlitDusk> 12Im still tired
<StarlitDusk> 12bed soon
<Proto> I don't like America much at all, military or not.
<Cat> omg http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_and_anthropogenic_disasters_by_death_toll
<Cat> it's not on there
<Curly> I said top 20 list >.>;
<Curly> oh wait
<Curly> that is 20 xD
<Curly> maybe top 50 then :p
<Cat> :p
<Curly> but that's still pretty high up
<LaptopAristeo> Curly: The Civil War had the most people killed on US soil than any other war
<Chimera> RP
<Chimera> :D
<Proto> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War
*Espeon lazytime time
<Chimera> Cya
<LaptopAristeo> The US is in a position where it really doesn't need to worry about threat of invasion
<Espeon> or rather, "gather enough sleep to be able to function tomorrow/later today"
<Espeon> oh well
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Night
<Proto> I'd be more worried about our own government.
<Chimera> Cya xF
<LaptopAristeo> Yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Timing
<Proto> Gimme a rifle and I'll defend my home to the death, come hell or high water.
<HyperMetalLugia> 02Hey Chimera, are you going to stream tonight, or tomorrow?
<LaptopAristeo> Canada doesn't really need to worry either and probably needs to worry less
<Curly> Canada's kind of comfily sitting on top of America's military
<Chimera> Dunno
<Chimera> Well
<Chimera> Not doing it tonight
<Cat> why not have a smaller, more elite army like the UK?
<Chimera> But I dunno if I'll continue streaming at all :E
<Chimera> You're the only person that watches >.>;
<Proto> Because, obviously, more guns = better.
<Proto> Duh.
<StarlitDusk> 12XD
<StarlitDusk> 12wait
<LaptopAristeo> Canada needs to protect its borders though!
<StarlitDusk> 12that was fail
<Cat> also, our nukes aren't on our soil, they're in submarines, constantly on the move around the coast so as to be harder to sabotage
<Cat> much more sensible
<Proto> http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101020/ap_on_sc/us_sci_oldest_galaxy
<Curly> the US's nukes are like 50 years old
<Curly> who knows if they'll even fire anymore
<Cat> :p
<Proto> I'm more than twenty percent sure they'd fire.
<Curly> I'm sure some of them will
<Curly> I'm sure some of them won't too :p
<Cat> Britain is the only country to have used a nuclear submarine in active combat if I remember correctly
<Proto> It's not like they're just sitting in the dirt alone, military techs and whatnot.
<Cat> that's pretty awesome
<StarlitDusk> 12night
<LaptopAristeo> RAWR STRYKER!
<StarlitDusk> 12i have to go to sleep now
<HyperMetalLugia> 02bye
<StarlitDusk> 12see you guys... tomorrow?
<StarlitDusk> 12night
<Stryker> hi

*Stryker tackles Cat to the ground.
<Proto> Lukewarm? :D
*Cat clings to Strkyer's side
*Curly tapes Cat and Stryker together
<Curly> :3
<Stryker> :O
*Stryker can't stand up, due to being unbalanced now.
<Cat> A Cat-Stryker hybrid!
<Cat> :O
*Proto would have used string, so as to not hurt cat and give him something to play with, like yarn or somesuchthing.
<Curly> you have to learn to cooperate, it's the only way you can save yourselves, and then save the world D:
<Stryker> Strycat or sumthin'
*Curly pushes Stryker and Cat off the hill of adventure
<Stryker> ;_;
*Cat rolls forever!
<Stryker> I don't do teams well.
*Stryker rolls too!

<Stryker> My name would be far too long.
<Proto> Strykat! :D
<Proto> or Strykar! >_>
<Proto> Or run away!
*Stryker runs.
*Stryker fails due to being attached to a rolling Cat.
<Proto> No I meant me to run to avoid the wrath of the Stryker/cat D:
*Curly yawns
*Stryker bites Curly.
<Curly> I think I ran out of hyper juice
*Curly is nommed
*Stryker injects Curly with caffeine.
*Curly twitches
*Curly falls backwards into her bed
<Stryker> D:
*Stryker pokes Curly with a stick.
<Stryker> Is it still alive?
*Proto does not know!
<Cat|Rolling> I need to sleep soon D:
<Proto> I suggest staying back a few feet though.
<Stryker> No you don't, Cat.
*Curly twitches
<Cat|Rolling> I do though

*Curly cuts the tape
<LaptopAristeo> I'm adopting my English teacher as an imouto
<Curly> xD
<Curly> now I have to imagine her as a bubbly eyed anime character :p
<LaptopAristeo> :3
*LaptopAristeo nods
<Proto> http://gallery.mobile9.com/f/1579939/
<LaptopAristeo> She's awesome though
<Curly> my friend Thomas was friends with his grade... 11 English teacher
<Proto> http://gallery.mobile9.com/f/1264991/ Better!
<Curly> he sent her text messages about random things
<Curly> liiike... smoking weed >.>
<LaptopAristeo> xD
<LaptopAristeo> College is cool
<Curly> "hey ms. T, I'm getting high!"
<LaptopAristeo> I'm on a first name basis with a lot of the people there
<Curly> I have no idea what he referred to her as
*Curly is just guessing
<Curly> I'm on first name basis with all my teachers though
<Curly> but... that's normal at my college
<Curly> everyone's on first name basis with the teachers >.>
*Stryker has no teachers.
*Stryker wins.
<Proto> I call my teacher by his last name, no mr, but that's common with him
<Curly> cheater D:
<Proto> Because he is Father Time.
<Curly> Father Time?
<Curly> your teacher's god? O:
*Stryker grabs the shotgun.
<Stryker> Where is he?
<Proto> No, he's just older than everything ever.
<Curly> it's kind of funny how the list of oldest people alive is totally filled with women ^^
*Curly wonders why though
<Curly> and it's not olive oil >.>
<Proto> 'cause they nagged their husbands to death!
*Proto runs
*Stryker chuckles.
<Stryker> >.>
*Curly wonders if any of them were lesbians
*Curly doubts it though
<Curly> the lifespan of lgbt people is pretty low on average :I
*Curly is going to die young!
<Proto> I am horrible at authoring.
*Stryker is too.
<Proto> I think the most I've ever written in one book is like...four pages?
<Curly> that sounds about the same as my writing dedication
<Stryker> I wrote 200+ pages.
<Stryker> For one story.
<Proto> Plus I am not good at writing, I feel like I am rambling on. D:
*Curly steals some of Stryker's motivation
*Stryker gives Curly some of it.
<Stryker> So it's not stealing. :p
<Curly> even better :D
<Steve> 12 Hello, ixr and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
*LaptopAristeo wants to try being a lesbian
<LaptopAristeo> It sounds so cool
<Stryker> It is.
<Proto> I want to try not being me, it sounds fun.
<LaptopAristeo> Stryker: May I be a lesbian with you and Curly?
<Curly> I'd like to try not being me too :O
<Stryker> No. D:
<Proto> I can't decide on a ringtone I want.
<LaptopAristeo> Stryker: but.... but.... you lub me :3
<Stryker> I need to buy more things from Gamestop. >.<
<LaptopAristeo> *^-^*
<Stryker> Psh. :p

<Curly> [19:20] <Stryker> I need to buy less things from Gamestop. >.< <-- fixed O:
<Stryker> D:
<Stryker> Why less? ._.
<Curly> why more D:
<Proto> Why not? D:
<Curly> buy from Steam instead, unless you're poking at console games at least
<Stryker> Because they just launched their rewards program. So I want free(ish) things. :p
<Stryker> I'm talking about console games.
<Stryker> I never buy PC games outside of Steam.
<Curly> okays, nevermind me then!
<Curly> I want a ps3
<Stryker> Come here and you can have mine. :p
<Curly> O:
*Stryker coaxes Curly into visiting.
<Curly> what State do you live in again?
<Stryker> Michigan.
*Curly drops by Michigan
<Stryker> :3
*Stryker gives Curly her PS3.
<Curly> lol, I wouldn't actually take it
<Stryker> ;_;
*Curly just visits
<Stryker> You hate me. ._.
<Curly> but.. wouldn't visiting you just to take your ps3 be worse? D:
<Stryker> That isn't the point. Let's pretend you visit me and I make the PS3 a gift, just because I can. :o It all works out.
<Stryker> I don't even play on the PS3. <.<
<Curly> that works then :O
*Curly is still iffy on taking the PS3
<Stryker> It does! :o
<Stryker> D:
<Stryker> Why now? ;_;
<Curly> I don't know, I've never been good at accepting gifts >.>
<Proto> It's afraid of Canadia!
*Stryker throws the PS3 at Curly.
<Curly> xD
<Stryker> Take the damn PS3. D:<
<Curly> fine fine :p
*Stryker runs away before she can reject it.
*Proto intercepts it and hands it gently to Curly
<Stryker> :o
*Curly wonders where Michigan is on the map
<Proto> Somewhere!
<Stryker> It's uh
<DarkTruth> lol
<Stryker> Somewhere.

<LaptopAristeo> I think I'm taking Stryker with me to Canada this winter :3
*Curly wikis
<Stryker> Do it.
<Curly> oh right! lake Michigan
*Curly forgot
*Stryker tags along with LaptopAristeo.
<Curly> I could drop by on my road trip :O
<LaptopAristeo> ^_^
*Curly is still planning to road trip across the continent
<LaptopAristeo> We can make a lesbian only club with just us three as starting members
<Curly> you have to bring DT too, Ari!
<DarkTruth> yea really :P
<LaptopAristeo> four*
<DarkTruth> and LaptopAristeo I am not seeing you as a lesbian :P
<LaptopAristeo> mhm
<DarkTruth> unless we get a wig ? o_O
*LaptopAristeo is a lesbian becuase he said so
*Proto gets a knife
<DarkTruth> xD
<Proto> There's a few other modifications needed for that to work
<LaptopAristeo> >:|
<Stryker> Drag queens can be bothersome. That's a no go, man.
<DarkTruth> :X
<LaptopAristeo> I am going to be a male guy and I'm going to still be a lesbian
<Stryker> o.o;
<Stryker> Good luck with that.
<Curly> xD
<LaptopAristeo> except for Stryker <3
*LaptopAristeo is a girl for Stryker
*Proto sharpens his bayonet
<Stryker> :3
<DarkTruth> hmmm going to go crawl in the bed and get on the laptop brb
<Curly> I wish I could crawl into bed with a laptop :I
<Stryker> I wish I had a laptop.
*Proto throws his netbook to Curly
<Stryker> And a good bed.

<Stryker> And my own room.
<Curly> you don't have your own room?
*Proto gets his toolbelt
<Stryker> Not really.
<Curly> that sucks :I

<Curly> hmmm
*Curly isn't sure if she's going to last another hour and a half before going to sleep :X
<Proto> I kind of wish I could shuffle :<
<Stryker> Sure you will.
<Curly> shuffle? liiike dragging your feet on the ground or like shuffling cards or something completely else?
<Stryker> I think he means like an MP3 player.
<Stryker> Clearly.
<Proto> I wish I could play songs with having no screen, yes, right from my face.
*Curly shuffles Stryker
<Proto> Curly, like the hardstyle dancing.
<Stryker> That'd be epic, Proto.
<Proto> Indeed :D
<Lu> HI
<Proto> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfSIcx1YgVE
<Proto> jumpstyle makes you look rather seizureistic imo.
<Proto> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGAatCB4KCw&feature=related Good one also.
<Proto> Although them dancing infront of traffic to disrupt it at the end is kinda stupid an rude.
<Curly> if a car decided not to stop and hit them they'd be at fault too :O
<Curly> the dancers I mean
<Curly> for standing in the middle of the road of course
<Proto> I like Fluro's pants
<Curly> and it would be awesome if you could make music right from your face xD
<Curly> it's called singing!
<Annual> AHA!
<Curly> hi :O
*Annual leaps out and startles everyone
<Annual> hello
<DarkTruth> there is a lot of people that think music comes out of there A** Curly :P
<Proto> Nawt teh saem! D:
<Proto> ^Curly
<Curly> well, judging by some people's singing *coughs and points at herself* I wouldn't be too surprised >.>
<Annual> just got done with building my theoretical parts list, and I think I am happy
<Proto> TeeHee, Curly.
<Annual> how is everyone else?
<DarkTruth> alright
<DarkTruth> you ?
<Annual> happy
<Stryker> Horrible.
<Annual> :O
*Annual hugss Stryker
<Annual> why are you horrible?
<Stryker> :O
*Stryker hugs back.
<Stryker> Just not feeling well, health wise.
<Annual> Sleep takes care of that
<Annual> go sleep
<Stryker> Plus having a problem with a friend doesn't help. ._.
<Stryker> D:
<Stryker> No
<Annual> I will keep your spot warm for you
<Stryker> I'm not slee- *falls asleep*
<Annual> oh, you are having issues with a friend?
<Stryker> Yeah.
<Annual> nothing that would belong on the Jerry Springer show I hope?
<Stryker> :p Not quite to that extent.
<Stryker> Just some mindless arguing.
<Annual> Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
<Annual> what are you two fighting bout?
<Stryker> It's to the point where I'm not even sure anymore.
<Annual> do you know how it started?
<Stryker> It started with us both being in a bad mood, so we both got set off by stupid things. Minor disagreements.
*Proto pokes Cat
<Stryker> Escalated into... now. He's pissed, I'm just sitting there listening. He provokes me, moar arguing. Calm down. Repeat.
<LaptopAristeo> Who could possibly be mad at Stryker?
<Annual> oh, thats never good
*Annual pets Cat
<Stryker> My ex, Ari.
<Cat> sleeping is apparenly failing
<Stryker> Possible boyfriend, but I'm not sure. Eh.
<LaptopAristeo> :O
<LaptopAristeo> noooooo
*LaptopAristeo keeps her Stryker all to herself
*Curly thinks that sounds like her relationship with Kata
<LaptopAristeo> mien
<Stryker> >_<
*Proto offers...something?
*LaptopAristeo bans Curly from contacting Kata ever
*LaptopAristeo puts Kata on the blackballed list
<Stryker> I haven't talked to that jackass in ages.
<Annual> well, you should explain to him that because he is a male, he should be sorry and apologize. Also note how he needs to apologize at random points in the day, for anything or nothing, just to cover all his bases
<Curly> the urge to talk to Kata has gone away
<LaptopAristeo> Okay good
*Proto puts Kata on a tiny spaceship and shoots him into deepsace.
<Stryker> All we did was argue because he thought I shouldn't talk to Gareth. And so he got pissed.
<Curly> sometimes the girl needs to apologize too you know, it's not like girls can't handle responsability
<Stryker> He won't apologize. :p No matter what.
<LaptopAristeo> It even makes me cringe when I see people talking about talking to Kata
<Curly> and obviously some guys can't either
<Stryker> I'd apologize but... uh...
<Annual> who is Kata?
<Stryker> I'm not sure what I did anymore. :/
<Curly> some person
<Annual> anyone care to tell me via PM?
<Proto> A dick.
<Stryker> Drama queen.
<LaptopAristeo> Well, no
<Proto> There, I summed it up in two words. :D
<LaptopAristeo> Basically, he has BPD
<Stryker> I forgot emo, but I guess that falls under drama queen.
<LaptopAristeo> BPD people are messed up
<Annual> Bi-Polar Disorder?
<LaptopAristeo> It's not his fault, his personality is just wired wrong
*Stryker supposedly has BPD. <.<
<Curly> borderline personality disorder
<Stryker> Oh
<Stryker> Pfeh.
<LaptopAristeo> Borderline Personality .... yeah, what Curly said
<Annual> :/
<Stryker> He has bipolar too, no?
<LaptopAristeo> You really need to stay away form people who have BPD -- always
<Curly> it's pretty much on the same level as sociopathy in psychiatric circles
<Stryker> Or so was his claim.
<Curly> incurable
<Curly> and hard to deal wiht
<LaptopAristeo> That's what I said before people realized he was messed up
<Annual> I know this is wrong, but people with mental issues should be put on a no breed list. they can bang, they just can't breeed
<LaptopAristeo> I was like, don't talk to him, he's BPD
<LaptopAristeo> But does anyone listen to me? noooooooo
<Annual> I listen to you Ari
<LaptopAristeo> :)
<Proto> Be quiet, LaptopAristeo. :P
*Annual snuggles up to ari
<LaptopAristeo> ^_^
<Curly> those kinds of mental illnesses aren't genetic
<Stryker> Agreed, Annual. >.>
<Stryker> And Ari
<Stryker> Where were you when I was 'friends' with him? D:
<Curly> and they're not really illnesses
<DarkTruth> sure its not BDP big dumb prick ?
<Proto> Hah.
<Curly> pretty much xD
<DarkTruth> sure works for him :P
<Proto> This gum has lost it's flavor :<
<Annual> :(
<Curly> psychiatric "disorders" are really just personalities that aren't compatible society
<Annual> Proto needs moar gum, STAT!
<Curly> not illnesses
<Proto> I forget what someone told me I had
<Proto> But it made me interesting :D
<Annual> oh, hell, I have a personality "disorder" then. If I said half the things I thought I would be carted off to prison for life as a preventative measure
<Stryker> So would everyone. lol
<Curly> it's not a disorder if it doesn't actually harm anything
<Annual> hmm
<Curly> that's the definition of disorder :O
<Annual> well
<Curly> sociopathy itself isn't inherently a disorder
<Annual> my thoughts tend to psychologically harm others
<Curly> since many socipaths are very sane
<Curly> maybe *too* sane
<Annual> yeah
<Annual> I was bout to say that
<Annual> Sociopatha are way too damned logical
<LaptopAristeo> :3
<Annual> sociopaths*
<LaptopAristeo> I'm probably a little sociopathic
<Annual> we all are
<Lu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKp1c9qVWxI&feature=related
<Lu> LOL
<Lu> oh hai capslock
<Curly> well, if you empathize with anybody, or feel sorry for something you've done, you're not a sociopath
<Annual> wait, would being able to rationalize all of your feelings be sociopathic?
<Curly> because the definition of sociopath is pretty much somebody that doesn't have a conscience
<Annual> hmm
<Curly> aka somebody who doesn't feel guilt
<Stryker> Oh cool, I'm not a sociopath.
<Stryker> Since I feel bad for *everything* I do.
<Curly> sociopaths are rare
<Annual> I am just barely not a sociopath
<Stryker> Even if it doesn't harm anyone. :p
<Annual> my not sociopathathy(sp) applies only to animals
<Curly> it's just sociopathy :p
<Annual> kitties are cute!
<Cat> yay, kitties
<Annual> people...not so much
<Proto> I feel bad for taking up space and food that could go to people who need it.
<Curly> well, that means you have a conscience somewhere
<Annual> I try and not be one of them dicks that throws away most of their food, which is why I will force myself to eat everything on my plate and not throw away leftovers unless they are clearly bad or I am told to
<DarkTruth> I buried my conscience a long time ago :P
*Annual hands DT a shovel
<Annual> start digging
<DarkTruth> no no :X
<Cat> I can't stand to see food thrown away either
<Cat> D:
<DarkTruth> leave it
<DarkTruth> I am ok without it
*Annual insists
*Stryker digs for DT.
*LaptopAristeo offers some Taco Bell to everyone
<Annual> thar be buried treasure next to it
<LaptopAristeo> :D
<Cat> mmm, food
<Annual> :D
<LaptopAristeo> :D
<Stryker> omg Taco Bell
<Annual> TACO BELL!!!!
*DarkTruth noms the taco hell
<LaptopAristeo> ^_^
*Stryker eats it ALL
<Curly> xD
<Cat> my desk seems like, 4 times bigger since i put my tower on the floor o.O
*Annual demands driving directions to Ari's location
<DarkTruth> lol
*Proto comes back and sees he missed free food :<
<Annual> anybody build a lot of PC's?
<Curly> I can build a PC
<Curly> but I don't build lots of them >.>
<Cat> I built mine and have upgraded various others
<Cat> :3
<Stryker> I built mine.
*Curly just takes apart her computers and maintains them and puts them back together again
<DarkTruth> I build a lot yea
*Stryker steals Curly's disc drive.
<Curly> that's okay, I have like 10 of them :X
<DarkTruth> too many to the point its a drain on my wallet >_<
<Stryker> D:
*Stryker steals 9 of them.
<Curly> D:
<Proto> Annual, I can turn on my netbook, does that count? :D
<Stryker> And a half.
<Stryker> 9 1/2
<Curly> I'm using like 6 T_+T
<Annual> DT might know whether or not this case is useable then
<Annual> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811147098
<Annual> lol
<DarkTruth> for what purpose ?
<Cat> time to rip some cds
<Curly> generally you don't need a gigantic case unless you're doing crazy cooling rigs or recording stuff
<Curly> oh
<Curly> that's decent for like a home computer for office and chatting
<Annual> Multimedia, with occasional RTS gaming
<Cat> it's microATX, just buy a motherboard to that standard
<DarkTruth> well if you are doing a basic computer I am sure its fine, you gotta ... what cat said
<Annual> the graphics card I want to slip in it is low profile and has HDMI out
<Cat> does it have a slot for a pci-e graphics card?
<DarkTruth> >_<
<Proto> I feel like I'm going to be sick
<Curly> it probably won't even be able to fit a good graphics card :I
<DarkTruth> yea it does
<DarkTruth> has to be a low profile
<Annual> it is
<Cat> is that like, a single-slot card?
<Cat> mine takes up two D:
<DarkTruth> but I don't know how much I would trust that Power supply with a vid card
<Annual> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814141119
<DarkTruth> the cheap PSUs they put in some of these cases can't handle all that much
<Annual> I can give it a better powersupply
<Curly> oh, yeah, generally you'd want like a 500watt power supply for gaming
<Cat> my graphics card is pretty much the opposite of low-profile
<Curly> at least
<Curly> I think
<DarkTruth> same Cat lol
*Curly hasn't been keeping up to date
*Stryker is waaaay behind.
*Stryker shuts up.
<DarkTruth> should be ok
<Proto> I think I'll just stick to lasers.
<Cat> I'd like a bigger case with more cooling
<Lu> Annual, were you considering buying that rosewill case?
<DarkTruth> as long as the PSU is not total crap
<Annual> yes, I was, why?
<DarkTruth> I guess check up on the reviews and see if you see a lot of complaints about it
<DarkTruth> the PSU that is
<Lu> Annual, it's a piece of crap, don't.
<Curly> wouldn't a slim computer case be worse at cooling?
<Annual> why?
<Lu> Annual, if you're getting a decent PSU, why pay for the $50 shitty case?
<DarkTruth> yea of course Curly
<Curly> yeah, Lu's right >.>
<Lu> Annual, because rosewill makes crappy cases.
<Curly> especially if you're going to game
<Stryker> And mice.
<DarkTruth> yea I gotta agree with Lu, I only will buy high end cases though :X
<Cat> my case is by Coolermaster!
<DarkTruth> same
<Annual> not gonna game, I would not consider Rise of nations or Dawn of War one gaming
<Cat> and cost me £30
<DarkTruth> well both of my main ones are
<Cat> D:
<Curly> the case I was looking at was a coolermaster one too >.>
<DarkTruth> and a Antec
<DarkTruth> and a AeroCool
<DarkTruth> :X
<Cat> does having the tower on top of the desk or below the desk make any difference to airflow?
<DarkTruth> under the desk picks up a LOT more dust :P
<DarkTruth> trust me on this one lol
<Annual> but, the other cases are soooooo much more expensive!
<Annual> lemme read the reviews
<Annual> besides, not like the power drain will be all that much
<Curly> I opened a case today and there was more dust in there than I've ever seen in one spot :X
*Proto points at the dust mines
<Curly> it wasn't actually the interior of the case itself, that was fine, but I took the front cover off it and it was just crammed >.>
<DarkTruth> the worst I have ever seen is the computer I built for my ex .... a year later
<Curly> yeah, this was like a 15 year old computer
<DarkTruth> she never cleaned it and it looked like a cat or something blew up in there xP
<Curly> and I'm sure no one's *ever* taken the front cover off it
<Curly> XD
<Cat> my pc isn't even a year old!
<DarkTruth> so much dust and nasty
<Cat> he is young
<Proto> Hahahahahahahah.
<Maser> o/ guys
<Curly> bye O:
<Curly> http://www.newegg.com/Product/ImageGallery.aspx?CurImage=11-129-061-TS&ISList=11-129-061-S01,11-129-061-S02,11-129-061-S03,11-129-061-S04,11-129-061-S05,11-129-061-S06,11-129-061-S07,11-129-061-S08,11-129-061-S09,11-129-061-S10&S7ImageFlag=1&Item=N82E16811129061&Depa=0&WaterMark=1&Description=Antec%20P183%20Black%20Aluminum%20/%20Steel%20/%20Plastic%20ATX%20Mid%20Tower%20Computer%20Case
*Curly passes the link on
*Proto blinks at huge link
<Curly> I like how that case looks ^^
<Stryker> That link isn't large.
<Stryker> Really.
<Curly> youtube has some crazy long links
<Proto> It is on my screen D:<
<Proto> Agreed Curly
<Stryker> Youtube?
<Cat> oooh, minimalist
<Cat> I wants
*Stryker stares at Curly.
<Curly> mmhm
<DarkTruth> anything with a door to me is yuck anymore
<Stryker> How did Youtube get into the conversation? D:
<Proto> I was looking at this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119230
<Curly> links?
<DarkTruth> I am never think they are made well enough
<Curly> liiike
<Curly> D:
<Curly> that link wasn't long at all!
<Cat> Doors would probably get annoying for me
<DarkTruth> yea I have the HAF 922 RED
<Curly> YouTube's failed me T_T
<Cat> even if I barely use the drive bays
<Proto> Or this thing
<Proto> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811103039
<Proto> Ewwww the fans change colors
<DarkTruth> yuck I don't like the xclios
<DarkTruth> I worked on one a year or so ago
<Lu> Annual, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817190027
<DarkTruth> was junk all around
<Proto> Heh, I was pointing out the overninethousand fans
<Lu> that's the cheapest good PSU on the site.
<Curly> I don't like the super flashy cases
*Curly has always been a fan of elegance
<Curly> subtlety people!
<DarkTruth> http://www.coolermaster-usa.com/product.php?category_id=19&product_id=2986 <-- yea thats my main case
<Annual> well, it is 12V, so it should work with what I want to stick in the case
<Cat> nice case, but a bit bright D:
<Curly> hey O:
<Proto> Haha there's a <5" 12v psu
<Lu> DarkTruth, weird, my friend just bought that one and it had like a huge chimney fan and it was super huge
<Curly> I think that's the exact same case I was looking at
<Curly> yeah, it's like 3 feet tall and nearly a foot wide >.>
<DarkTruth> yea its a awesome case
<Lu> DarkTruth, it's nice, but a little flashy for me, I don't like open air cases either
<DarkTruth> and that power supply is totally overkill for someone running a low end system, sorry to say
<Proto> I still think level ten is the stupidest case ever.
<Lu> I like tight aluminum cases with a smooth finish
<Proto> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811133089
<Cat> I like everything to be black
<DarkTruth> yea I had thought about a aluminum Lian Li
<Proto> http://www.mini-box.com/s.nl/it.A/id.417/.f
<Proto> That PSU :D
*Annual adds the improved PSU to his list and stands back
<DarkTruth> oh god the pico PSUs
<DarkTruth> >_<
<Proto> http://www.silentpcreview.com/article601-page1.html
*Proto prances away from DT.
<Annual> not too bad still, just $570
<Lu> lol
<Lu> Annual, hey, did you get that link I put there for you?
<Annual> yes, that price I just listed is with the PSU added
<Proto> This is where I first saw it: http://short-circuit.com/product/picoPSU-90.html
<Lu> Annual, and if you think $100 is too much for a PSU, then you shouldn't pay more than $300 for the entire system.
<Proto> I was looking for a 3.5A, 36V PSU.
<Annual> I never said 100 is too much for a PSU
<Annual> I am going for quality with a minimal profile without sacrificing functionality too much
<DarkTruth> I said 700 watt is overkill for someone that is running a system that will pull 350 watt max
<DarkTruth> and there is a lot of good PSUs for under $100
<DarkTruth> given I would not buy anything under $50 for the life of me
<Lu> Annual, minimal profile? why is that a good thing?
<Curly> http://thepcmdaz.com/images/hpa305w.JPG
<Curly> there's my case :D
<Annual> well, I am looking at it this way: if I get a 100 dollar 700 watt PSU, then that should last me quite a long time, and even allow me to stick it into a larger and more powerful system
<Curly> my old case (the one I dumped a year ago) was one of those 1990s white box style cases >.>
<Curly> my power button glows bright blue ^^
<DarkTruth> yea I remember Curly it was a old Dell XPS T system lol
<Curly> yes I realize it's super old
<Lu> Annual, the wattage isn't as important as the efficiency rating
<Lu> Annual, so yes, it's a good lasting PSU, but anyways, why is minimal profile a good thing?
*Curly supposes a 200watt psu with super conductors would probably be as good as a 500watt with copper wires >.>
<DarkTruth> Amperage is the main thing your looking for
<Annual> minimal profile means it can sit on the glass shelving units above my HDTV and not look unsightly
<Annual> http://pastebin.com/4RQdYHvf
<Annual> that is the full parts listing
<Lu> Annual, ahh, a set-top box, makes sense now
<Annual> excluding input devices and software
<Annual> yeah
<Curly> I think if a slim case best suits your needs, go for it
<Curly> and according to you you won't even be doing high performance stuff
<Curly> so it shouldn't matter
<Annual> I hope to build it to replace the need for a Blu-Ray player and be able to play RTS games on the 52 inch screen, as well as do web browsing and everyday computing
<Cat> is the 52-inch screen 1080p?
<varchld> 52" would make it kinda pixelated unless you can AA the hell out of it right?
<Annual> yes
<Cat> most big screens seem to be
<Proto> Goodbye.
<Cat> it'd be nice if they could have higher resolutions and just keep 1080p for 22-24" screens really
<Annual> if the visual quality seems to be suffering, I will just turn the 4:3 ratio on
<Annual> wait
<Annual> no, I watch a lot of things in 1080P, does not seem to suffer much
<Annual> if at all
<Cat> when you're sat on a sofa you're far away enough to not see any aliasing anyway
<varchld> Yeah
<Annual> I sit within 4 feet of the screen
<Annual> off to the side
<Annual> seeya Proto
<Lu> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813121399
<Curly> why not just buy a computer monitor for a 22"-24" screen?
<Curly> they have better than 1080p >.>
<Curly> the first time I saw a "high definition" monitor I was kind of disappointed
<Cat> I've not seen any monitors with a higher resolution than 1920x1080 that wasn't ridiculously expensive :/
<Annual> because I do not need a desktop computer? I want this to be my home theater comp
<DarkTruth> ugh I have used Atom boards they are not powerful enough for a lot of stuff, specially if he wants to do some gaming ..... but anyway I gotta go
<DarkTruth> job early in the morning
<Curly> Cat, 1920x1080 isn't the same thing as 1080p
<Annual> I dunno, Intel Atom runs Morrowind quite nicely
<Cat> really Curly?
<Cat> I don't know anything about tvs D:
<Curly> there's a reason computer monitors aren't termed in something p
<Curly> p stands for progressive scan
<Curly> most computer monitors don't even work that way
<Cat> my two monitors are 1920x1080, then
<Cat> one is 22", the other is 24"
<Cat> so do computer monitors generally do it better?
<Curly> yeah
<Annual> :/ but why would I go off and buy a new screen when I have one already around?
<Curly> there's a reason why an 80" computer monitor is $50,000 and an 80" tv monitor is only $1000 :p
<Curly> god knows who would buy an 80" computer monitor though but apparently there's a market for it
<Curly> Annual, I was just talking about Cat's comment
<Cat> you can buy 80" computer monitors??
<Curly> yes
<Proto> $1,000 is a lot of money. ._. (</back for a bit>)
<Cat> you'd have to crane your neck to see the whole thing, surely?
<Cat> o.O
<Curly> there was one on NewEgg
<Curly> well
<Curly> you'd probably sit it far away
<Cat> I'm quite happy with 3840x1080, thanks
<Curly> DX
<Curly> I didn't notice DT leave >_<
<Cat> poor Curly
*Curly was reading scrollback when DT left
<Curly> reading and replying to >_>
<Curly> wait, when did Stryker leave? D:
<Proto> The 65" monitors are averaging $,7000
<Cat> Stryker left?
<Cat> D:
<Cat> about 15 minutes ago, apparently
<Cat> 18 past
<Curly> yeah Proto, big computer monitors are insanely expensive >.>
<Proto> <Lu> Annual, hey, did you get that link I put there for you?
<Proto> <Annual> yes, that price I just listed is with the PSU added
<Proto> * Stryker has quit (Quit: Bleh.)
<Proto> <Proto> This is where I first saw it: http://short-circuit.com/product/picoPSU-90.html
<Proto> 2 12W speakers
<Proto> for a 70" monitor
<Proto> Fail
<Proto> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824001346
<Stryker> Damn mIRC.
<Stryker> I dun wanna register.
<varchld> Stryker's back =P
<sally> :3
<Proto> And I'm gone again.
<sally> D: why Proto ?
<Annual> Heya Sally!
<Proto> Because.
<sally> hi :)
<Curly> hi sally, welcome back Stryker, bye Proto :O
<sally> :p
<Proto> Goodbye, Curly.
<sally> hi Curly c:
*Stryker greets the channel.
<Proto> And Hi/Bye sally.
<Charles> silly Stryker, the channel is an inanimate object
<sally> hi hi Proto :D
<Stryker> ._.
<Stryker> But I like the channel, anyways.
<Charles> lol
<Cat> time to try sleeping again I think
<Cat> I fail at this
<Cat> srsly
<Stryker> Sleeping is bad, though.
<Curly> bye Cat, again :p
<Cat> bye!
<Stryker> And so it dies once Cat leaves.
<Stryker> D:
*Curly chirps
*sally quacks
*varchld blargleargles
*Charles moos
*Curly pokes var's blargleargles
*Stryker barks.
<Charles> Cows: a more noble and benevolent animal I cannot think of
*varchld bleats after the poke
<Curly> and they all face north while they eat O:
<sally> nuuuuh uuuuh
<Charles> yeah, thats not true
<Stryker> I hate cows.
*sally sees cows eat all the time
<Charles> HEATHEN!
<Curly> I doubted it but it's still funny to cite Cracked as fact :p
<varchld> In the sothern hemisphere, do they eat facing south?
<Curly> xD
<Stryker> Cracked. <3
*Charles is no longer friends with Stryker
<Charles> :/
<sally> :o
<Stryker> D:
<varchld> D:
*Stryker cries.
<Curly> I love Cracked :O
<Curly> well
<Charles> Stryker is a Heathen, I cannot be seen with him
<Curly> most of Cracked
*sally points to Charles and yells heifer
<Charles> her?
<Curly> her
<Curly> well
<varchld> Does that mean there is a position as "friend of stryker" opened up for application?
<Stryker> Yes.
<sally> noo
*Charles jumps back into friend spot
<Curly> wells
<Stryker> D:
<sally> mine
<Charles> Please take me back!
<Stryker> No. ;_;
<varchld> XD
<Charles> :'(
*Stryker forces varchld into the spot.
*Charles crais and goes over to sit with sally
<varchld> ^^
<Stryker> sally is already a friend. :o
<sally> heeeey
<varchld> I was just preparing my application =D
<sally> but i take all the spots :3
<Curly> Curly is thinking she might go to bed in 5 minutes
<Stryker> Stryker thinks Curly should not leave. Ever.
<sally> **10minutes
*Curly bounces a banana off var's head
<Curly> xD
*varchld chases after the nana
*Charles really wants to make a long and complicated friend application paper for being his friend, and have it look a lot like a phone contract
<Curly> I have a busy day tomorrow though, so I don't really have a choice >:
<Stryker> Do it.
<sally> :o
<Stryker> No.
<Stryker> Bad Curly.
<Stryker> Stay. Forever. Never leave us.
<sally> **15minutes
<Stryker> Or that.
<Charles> lol
<Curly> but... I have an appointment, and a shopping trip, and stuff D:
<Charles> noooo
<Stryker> I don't care.
<sally> **20mintues
<Curly> D:
<Stryker> 2000 minutes.
<sally> either agree to the terms or stay longer v_v
<Curly> I'd stay longer if I had an alarm clock >.>
*Stryker looks at varchld.
<Charles> such things are not important. why visit prior committments or buy physical objects when you can sit in front of your computer screen all day and all night, sipping on Dr Pepper and nomming Ramen?
*Stryker fashions him into an alarm clock.
<sally> :o go get one on ur shopping trip
<Curly> oh right, I was meaning to
*varchld begins beeping
*Curly jots that down
<sally> DR. PEPPER AND RAMEN
<Stryker> There.
<sally> \o/
*Stryker hands varchld to Curly.
<Charles> \o/
*varchld beeps louder "Nooosleeping"
<sally> Charles: you ish the man
*Curly chews on var
<Curly> XD
*sally chews on the chew
*varchld short circuits D:
<Stryker> D:
<Curly> yay! that means I get to sleep
<sally> no u still gots some minz left ma'am
<Charles> I AM the man! then again, I am not sure if there is a single other male in this channel
*Stryker turns into an alarm clock, too.
*Stryker beeps louder than var did.
<Curly> a few, var's the only one talking at the moment I think
<Charles> so I might be The last man on Epic-Chat
<Charles> oh
*Curly pokes Charles with var
<varchld> Var's the only one beeping at the moment*
<Curly> xD
*Curly nuzzles var <3
*varchld cuddles Curly <3
<sally> hmm
<Charles> I refuse to acknowledge an alarm clock as a member of my gender
<Stryker> Get a room.
*sally anti-pokes Lu
<Proto> Can't sleep
*Proto grumbles
<Proto> Also, <3 the /clear feature
<Curly> hey, we usually keep it private D:
<Stryker> :P
<Curly> it's not like we're making out or something
<Charles> Proto, get to bed now before I come and tuck you into bed, then sit in a wood chair across the room and watch you sleep
<sally> do eet
<Stryker> Not that you would mind that.
*Stryker hides.
<Curly> that wasn't the point :p
<Proto> Charles, touch me and I'll slit your throat with a razor blade :)
<sally> ouch
<Charles> hmmm
<LaptopAristeo> Poor Charles :(
<Charles> that would be a new sensation
<Charles> lets do it
<Proto> Would be a quick sensation
<Charles> does not matter
<Charles> as long as it is new and exciting
<sally> D:
*Stryker isn't sure what's going on now.
<sally> you cant do that Proto
<Proto> I can to
<sally> Charles ish the man :p
<Charles> \o/
<Curly> don't decipher it Stryker, just go with the flow
*Stryker flows.
<Curly> xD
*LaptopAristeo flows with Stryker
<LaptopAristeo> :D
<LaptopAristeo> weeeeeeeeeee
<Charles> go with the flow of blood from my caratoid
<Stryker> Let's all flow!
<sally> eeewww

<Proto> Close
<Proto> no i
<Charles> damn
*Charles spins around on his barstool

*Stryker chuckles.

<Stryker> Well
<LaptopAristeo> April is kinda hot in the last half
<Stryker> You're in a state where grass catches on fire, no?
<sally> lol sure
*Charles notes how the opening theme of the server is pokemon related, and as we all know, nothing dies in the world of pokemon, it just faints
<LaptopAristeo> Hay does here
<Stryker> Therefore, it wouldn't be cold for you. D:
*sally ***faints
<LaptopAristeo> Everything catches on fire in Texas D:
<sally> nuh uh
<Charles> therefore, we were wrong when we claimed we dieds
<Charles> even fire catches on fire in Texas
<LaptopAristeo> sally: Name one thing in Texas that doesn't catch fire
<sally> Texas is just bipolar
<sally> sally, and air, and clouds and the street and my mail box
<sally> and ice cream and snow
<sally> and poo
<sally> oh wait maybe poo
<sally> and... the gate
*Proto pours absinthe into the room
<sally> aaannndd...
<Charles> Texas is rather green, making every map I rmember seeing of Texas a big fat liar
<sally> pfft
<sally> green where?

<Charles> the sludge underneath the dumpsters
<Charles> such heat does not make for pretty decomposition
*Curly realizes she's still awake

<Stryker> CURLY
<Stryker> RAWR
*Stryker hugs sally.
<Stryker> D:
<Stryker> She left!

<Proto> D:(
<Proto> D:**
*Proto leaves too
<Curly> sorry, no I haven't D:
<Stryker> ._.;
<sally> :O CURLY CANT LEAVE
<sally> mwahaha
*Curly is just distracted by researching piercings
<sally> ooo
<Curly> I figured if I'm going to go get one soon I should know what I'm doing >.>
*Curly was thinking she'd go by the same rules as looking for a tattoo parlour and she's pretty much right
<Curly> I didn't know tongue piercings healed so fast though
<Stryker> Blargh.
<sally> i didnt think they did
<Curly> they heal in like a month
<Stryker> I'm too much of a wimp for piercings. lol
*Curly pokes Stryker's blargh
<sally> lol that doesnt sound very fast
<Curly> sally, ear lobe piercings can take like half a year
*sally thought Curly meant a week or 2 :p
<sally> nuh uuh
<Curly> uh huh!
<Stryker> I guess if you're gonna create a hole in yourself... That's a pretty good amount of time.
*sally pierced her ear
<Curly> me too!
<sally> it healed in a couple of days
*Stryker didn't not!
*Stryker is odd. ._.
<Curly> and my right ear still isn't totally healed
<varchld> I didn't either D:
<sally> :O
<Stryker> We can be odd together!
<Curly> the average healing time for an ear lobe piercing is about 4-6 monhts
<sally> :O NOOOWAAAAY
<Curly> yesway
<sally> show me :o
<Curly> well I could tell you from experience
<Curly> http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/body-piercing.html
<Curly> there's also that
<sally> so could i :o
<Stryker> Pfft. Experience doesn't mean anything.
<Curly> I had to clean my piercings every single day for like a month or else they'd get crusty from blood
<sally> idk about when i first got them pierced but when i did it myself it was like a couple of days
<sally> i did the same but not for as long :o
<sally> maybe i am superhuman :p
<varchld> Huh, the male genitalia is faster than the navel
<Stryker> ...
<sally> o.o
<Stryker> Wha...
<sally> now that i find hard to believe
<varchld> In healing time D:
<Curly> lots of blood going around there
<Stryker> Oh
<Curly> >.>
<Stryker> >_<
<varchld> XD
<varchld> I don't want to know how else that sentence could be read =P
<Stryker> <.<
*Stryker coughs.
*Curly didn't think there'd be any other ways to read it ._.;
<Stryker> There probably aren't
<Stryker> But I'm getting tired.
<varchld> If they didn't click the link it might not make sense.
<Curly> oooh
<Curly> what you said
<Stryker> But... I clicked the link...
<Curly> well yeah that would have been weird if it was out of context :p
<sally> pfft, you can pierce ur own body.
<sally> if the thing about ear cartilage is true i dont wanna do it anymore
<Curly> I don't understand how your piercing healed in a few days >.>
<sally> mmz i dunno
<sally> i pierced one ear one day and the other the next
<sally> then it was healed in approx a week
<LaptopAristeo> :3
<Stryker> So
<Stryker> I hate songs that bring back memories
<Stryker> For no obvious reason.
*sally too
<Proto> http://wimp.com/petowl/
<Proto> I hate the song best friend by Jazon Mraz.
<Stryker> I hate Jason Mraz.
<Proto> That works too. \o/
<Stryker> :3
<LaptopAristeo> And I was like......
<LaptopAristeo> Baby baby baby OHHHHHHHHHHH
<Stryker> . . .
<LaptopAristeo> I'm sorry
<LaptopAristeo> Forget I said that
<Stryker> D:
<Curly> okays, research complete!
<Stryker> I don't know you anymore.
<LaptopAristeo> noooooo
*Curly is going to go to bed now
*LaptopAristeo cries
*Stryker clings to Curly.
*Curly is decided on a belly piercing for tomorrow
<Stryker> B-But... I'll be lonely if you leave!
<Curly> DL
<Curly> D:
<LaptopAristeo> Stryker: You have meeeeeee!
*Curly hugs Stryker
<Proto> Goodnight, Curly.
<LaptopAristeo> I was just saying it ironically :3
<Proto> Sleep well, friend.
<Curly> I have to go to sleep sometime >:
<Stryker> But you're not Curly! D:
<LaptopAristeo> it's okay if it's done ironically, that counters it :3
<Stryker> ._.
<Stryker> Fine. *sulks* I don't mind.
<Proto> I'm here?
*LaptopAristeo pulls Stryker into Curly's bed with him
<LaptopAristeo> sleep over \o/
<Curly> D:
<Stryker> D:
*Curly huggles Stryker more
<Curly> good night :<
<Stryker> :o
*Stryker huggles MOAR
<LaptopAristeo> We can paint each other's finger nails and tell ghost stories
<Stryker> Bai. ._.; Sleep well.
*Proto highfives Curly
<Stryker> Oh god no.
*Curly highfives
<sally> :c
*Stryker goes back to Off The Chain.
<Proto> :<
<sally> :o Stryker, i like jason mraz.
<Stryker> D:
<Stryker> I don't like that single he had. >.< It was like... on the radio a lot
<Stryker> And I completely forgot the name, so I look stupid.
<Proto> "Hey, it's Jason Mraz!" "No I'm not." "Yes you are, you're a guy with a hat!"
<sally> idk if i like all of his songs
*sally prob doesnt
<sally> i like one of them at least tho :3
<Stryker> I'm Yours.
<Stryker> I hated that one.
<Proto> Yeah that's it
<Stryker> With a firey burning passion.
<sally> xD
<sally> that's the one i like
<Stryker> ..D:

<Lu> hah, papa john has clean kitchens and expensive ingredients, which is to say, perhaps not as greasy as it should be...
<sally> LMAO
<LaptopAristeo> The Red Baron is from the air force and he was a figher pilot ace :3
<sally> clean kitchens my ass
<sally> never heard of it
<Lu> and his dough is very high quality
<sally> yeah ok
<Lu> sally, perhaps your papa johns is run by some cheapskates, all the California papa johns are really clean
<sally> blech. i hate them.
<Lu> the pepperoni is too high-grade though, not crispy and greasy enough and they don't have cheddar cheese, it's mozz
<sally> i'm not really a fan of pizza anyway
<Lu> what pizza places do they have around your area?
<Andres> The only sport I like is swimming :D
<Andres> And then of course, I do not like watching it D:
<sally> pizza hut, dominos, and papa johns
<Andres> Unless it are chicks skinny dipping, then I like watching it.
*sally cant swim
<Lu> Andres, I am okay with that.
<Lu> sally, you know what?

<Lu> sally, I've worked at over 5 pizza places. and I've made homemade pizza since I was 9.
<Andres> D:
<Andres> I can only kick butts in butt-kicking contests ._.
<sally> and i've lived in texas all my life so..
*sally wins :3
<Lu> sally, I can make it from scratch from one of many recipes in my head
<sally> umm
<sally> that's the only way to MAKE your own pizza dork
<sally> from scratch that is
<Lu> sally, okay. so what's in your dough?

<sally> o.o what? why?
<Lu> sally, but have you tried dominos since they've changed the recipe? it's pretty good. I didn't expect them to succeed so well, they could be better, but it's decent now.
<sally> i have not
<Lu> pizza hut still has weird-tasting crust though
<Lu> and cheap crappy ingredients
<sally> nuh uh
<Lu> and little ceasar is still nearly inedible
<sally> i havnt been there in years
<sally> the last time i went it was good :o
<Lu> sally, yeah, well. their sausage is the worst.
<Lu> I wouldn't feed it to a dog since it would be poison.
<Lu> I might feed it to a starving person, but I think they would barf it up

<Quanyails> 7o.o
<JetTheLatios> I never played WoW honestly
<Touridor> green midgets and furries
*ixr bites his neck gently
<Touridor> can it get any better?
<LaptopAristeo> Guest17239: I'm here now
*Touridor mauled
<Quanyails> 7Nweh?

<Averogite> 3BETRAYAL!
<JetTheLatios> Is it worth my money?
<Guest17239> Ive got something cool to show you soon.
<Averogite> 3ILL TELL ICY!
<JetTheLatios> I heard alot of bad things about it though
<Kipi> No
<Touridor> yeah
<Quanyails> 7WoW, lol?
<JetTheLatios> World of warcraft
<Quanyails> 7Well, it certainly drains it.
<JetTheLatios> :P
<Touridor> depends on the server you go on
<Averogite> 3oj :D
<ixr> And ill kill you
<JetTheLatios> I dont like the idea of pay to play
<JetTheLatios> If you dont play
<Skylands> 10World of Warfail
<Averogite> 3that's right! :D
<JetTheLatios> Lol
<Touridor> they just need to lower the monthly payment
<ixr> Oj?
<JetTheLatios> Your money goes down the drain
<Averogite> 3(only joking)
<Touridor> yeah XD that's the only problem
<JetTheLatios> But I heard some very bad stories about it
<Touridor> if they removed that part, Im pretty sure Skylands would take back what she said since she probably never played the game before :P
<JetTheLatios> Like this one
<JetTheLatios> A bf and gf
<JetTheLatios> The bf is addicted to WoW
<Prince-dari> Hey ixr.
<Touridor> oh and its easily addicting
<JetTheLatios> He even left to go play WoW and left his Gf in the hospital while shes giving birth
<JetTheLatios> :/
<Touridor> wow
<Kipi> If you've never played a game maybe
*Vulcan 14murrs.
<Averogite> 3"Dude, stop pervin' on my tomato soup!!@
<Touridor> I hate it when poeple start insulting the game when they never actually played it
<Touridor> if you are gonna insult it, atleast have some expirience of actually PLAYING the game.
<Touridor> kthxbai.
<Prince-dari> You here Stormy`?
<Skylands> 10[17:42] <Touridor> if they removed that part, Im pretty sure Skylands would take back what she said since she probably never played the game before :P <- Runescape plz
*Skylands hides
<Touridor> lol
<Kipi> WoW is mediocre at best. I think its only popular because it happens to be online
<JetTheLatios> lol
<JetTheLatios> When did it first start anyway?
<ixr> I like oj
<ixr> Oh
<ixr> :P
<ixr> Good
<ixr> Hi
*ixr bites a little harder
<Touridor> runescape sucks in my opinion. And before you asked, yes, I've played it.
<Quanyails> 7D:
<Quanyails> 7RS.
<JetTheLatios> Yeah I quitted lmao
<Quanyails> 7I played it until Java borked on my computer.
<Averogite> 3omg, its veefa!
<JetTheLatios> Its so grindy :(
<Prince-dari> http://www.cracked.com/article_18461_5-creepy-ways-video-games-are-trying-to-get-you-addicted.html
<Skylands> 10I stopped playing due to boredom
<Averogite> 3*runs for the hills*
<Quanyails> 7Grindy, meh.
<JetTheLatios> And the community too
<Quanyails> 7Do you want to speed through a game?
<JetTheLatios> In my opinion
<Touridor> Warcraft then Warcraft II then Warcraft III then World of Warcraft then WoW: Burning Crusade then WoW: Wrath of the Lichking and now WoW: Cataclysm
<Touridor> which comes out tomorrow
<Kipi> Exactly, JetTheLatios
<JetTheLatios> The most important attribute to a game is it's community
<fyralegend> 13Go help my dragonshttp://dragcave.net/user/fyralegend
<JetTheLatios> If the community is so bad
<JetTheLatios> Full of hacker/scammers
<JetTheLatios> The in-game economy takes a hit
<Quanyails> 7LOL
<Quanyails> 7LAWL
<Kipi> The only "progress" is leveling up and finding nifty items & mounts.
<JetTheLatios> I played mabinogi
<Quanyails> 7Hackers? XD
<Prince-dari> People still do that dragon cave thing?
<Stormy`> Yeah, hi
<Quanyails> 7People can't hack RS.
<JetTheLatios> I know lol
<Quanyails> 7And economy, LOLOLOL.
<JetTheLatios> But just saying
<JetTheLatios> :P
<Prince-dari> How are you?
<JetTheLatios> In mabinogi
<JetTheLatios> it changed so much
<Quanyails> 7It has one of the most complex economies in MMORPGs.
<JetTheLatios> since I played
<Stormy`> Pretty good, you?
<JetTheLatios> Muffler robes are worth
<Prince-dari> I'm good thanks.
<JetTheLatios> 10k now
<Kipi> I'd rather play TES
<JetTheLatios> I saved up for 5 months on it
<JetTheLatios> xD
<JetTheLatios> 1m~
<Stormy`> Where've you been lately? :p
<JetTheLatios> Plus I got scammed a few times
<ixr> Hey dari were yiu here when the old ixr was?
<ixr> You*
<Quanyails> 7In Mabinogi?
<Averogite> 3DUDE, WTF ARE U DOING ON MY ASS?
<JetTheLatios> mhm
<Stormy`> You disappeared again
<Prince-dari> You ever seen Russel Howard's Good News? "Edward Cullen had never been more hungry for blood in his life, Bella was on her period".
<Quanyails> 7Scammed how?
<JetTheLatios> Well
<JetTheLatios> You know me
<JetTheLatios> Im too nice
<Stormy`> lololol
<Prince-dari> Computer problems.
<JetTheLatios> I lend things to newbies and bam
<JetTheLatios> :P
<Stormy`> ah
<Prince-dari> Old ixr?
<Quanyails> 7RS has a lending system. :P
<JetTheLatios> But sometimes I just get ripped off lmao
<Averogite> 3ixr is
<JetTheLatios> But I dont mind
<Averogite> 3...
<JetTheLatios> Its the newbies that sicken me the most
<Quanyails> 7The economic price for goods allows you so you can't get too much or too little for something.
<Averogite> 3ixr!
<JetTheLatios> Well in mabinogi
<JetTheLatios> There isnt really a stock market
<JetTheLatios> its just based on other people's judgement lol
<ixr> Lol ;P
<ixr> Yeah
<ixr> Old ixr was a different person who left this quite awhile ago
<ixr> He gave me his name and i stayed
<ixr> I probably should change it...
*Quanyails 7boasts that that's something RS regulates most other games don't. o.O
<JetTheLatios> The color, durability and enchants effect the price of an item
*Vulcan 14wiggles.
<JetTheLatios> Oh and also
<Quanyails> 7affects*
<Averogite> 3so there is a new ixr, an old ixr, all as a same person?
<JetTheLatios> Yeah xD
<JetTheLatios> I gotta watch out for the difference
<Prince-dari> I don't know, I suppose I knew "Old ixr" then.
<JetTheLatios> And also... since Nexon got cheap and started charging more for premium service
<JetTheLatios> Dyes are 100k now
<JetTheLatios> Dyes used to be 50k or lower
<Averogite> 3whats the difference between new and old?
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<JetTheLatios> xD
<Quanyails> 7That's a lot, right?
<JetTheLatios> Dyes are little pellets taht you use to change the color of an item
<JetTheLatios> And yeah :P
<Quanyails> 7It's totally... what's the word...
<Quanyails> 7Where something only differs in appearance and has no other benefit?
<JetTheLatios> Greed?
<Quanyails> 7No...
<JetTheLatios> Hey you should look at my character lol

<Stormy> So I offered to make a channel here
<Averogite> 13Why you not whant to help my streptococcus.
*ixr licks prince-daris cheek* good

<spyrorocks> Ive owned a lot of android phones.

<spyrorocks> ive done it a hundred times

<Theguesst> I'll shrug it off like sc2
<Kosovo> Human after all is my favorite song of theirs
<spyrorocks> and selecting wifi settings
<spyrorocks> so you can activate it.
<spyrorocks> if not do a 4 corner tap
<Curly> but there is no menu button for wifi in there
<Curly> 4 corner tap?
<Manlyguy> It's so simple, yet...so chill. o:
<Kosovo> technologic, something about us, da funk, harder better faster stronger, around the world, and one more time are my other favorites. <3

<Armads> lol
<Light_Latias> 12K(a)m(e a p)art
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<eXAKR> bbl Lunch
<Armads> The Hg chemical symbol for mercury stands for "hydrargyrum".
<Armads> Latin for "watery silver".
<Armads> er, greek not latin.
<Armads> lol
<Armads> Latinized Greek.
<Kosovo> Greekinized latin. lol
<Light_Latias> 12eww
<Light_Latias> 12Mercury
*Light_Latias ><;
<Kosovo> Bromine
<Kosovo> <3
<Kosovo> Chlorine
<Kosovo> <3
<Kosovo> Iodine
<Kosovo> <3
<Kosovo> All the halogens
*Light_Latias thinks of 1000 Ways to Die...
<Kosovo> <3
<Armads> Bromine sounds like something college geeks would call each other.
<Armads> "What's up my BROMINE?? LOLOLOLLLOL"
<Kosovo> XD
<Armads> I should start calling my friends that.
<Armads> See how long till I get punched.
*Light_Latias lols
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Kosovo> bromide ftw
<Kosovo> Br-
<Armads> Halogen is a cool word.
<Kosovo> Sounds like a drug. lol
<Armads> lol
<Armads> I think my favorite element though
<Kosovo> "wanna get up on some halogens tonight bro?"
<Armads> is technetium.
<Armads> it's like
<Armads> cooool
<Armads> It has both an awesome name and it's radioactive.
<Armads> For just no reason.
<Kosovo> XD
<Armads> like, there's WAY more dense elements that still have stable isotopes
<Armads> but technetium is like "yeah whatever :|"
<Armads> as if nature doesn't like the number 43 or something lol
<Kosovo> lol
<Kosovo> sad
<Kosovo> since like
<Armads> so it breaks it down
<Armads> busting out some phat beatz.
<Armads> and beta particles.
<Armads> like a boss.
<Armads> *lock a boss
<Light_Latias|Away> 12bbls~
<Kosovo> Gamma radiation is like the final boss
<Kosovo> alpha radiation
<Kosovo> pfffffffffffft
<Kosovo> you can block that with a piece of paper. :P
<Kosovo> literally
<Armads> lol yeah
<Armads> isn't alpha radiation just electrons?
<Kosovo> no
<Kosovo> helium nucleuses, i believe
<Armads> ah, then I have it backwards. lol
<Kosovo> beta radiation is the electrons
<Kosovo> yeah
<Kosovo> some elements decay so quickly when created it's sad
<Kosovo> really. :'(
<Kosovo> like
<Armads> Tc-99 should be my new gaming moniker.
<Kosovo> bh
<Kosovo> Bohrium
<Kosovo> has a half life of a minute.
<Kosovo> :'(
<Armads> lol :(
<Armads> Poor Bohr.
<Armads> Never stood a chance.
<Kosovo> and it's named after one of the most important guys in all of chemistry
<Kosovo> created the bohr model that I used all the time.
<Armads> irony ftw. lol
<Kosovo> XD
<Kosovo> worse
<Kosovo> its WAY more stable
<Kosovo> then it's suceeding elements
<Kosovo> *succeeding
<Armads> lol
<Armads> I heard some isotopes have half-lives of like, a few milliseconds maybe. rofl
<Armads> Of the synthetic elements.
<Kosovo> typos
<Kosovo> ugh
<Kosovo> oh yeah
<Kosovo> that's what I was talking about
<Kosovo> that's why you can discover prolly thousands upon thousands of isotopes/elements
<Kosovo> and have it not mean much
<Armads> lol inorite
<Armads> It's like
<Kosovo> since the more elections you add, and the more you add to the nucleus
<Armads> some guys out there are just making elements for the heck of it.
<Kosovo> the less and less it will last
<Kosovo> XD
<Armads> They're sitting at expensive computers
<Armads> operating their atom smashers
<Kosovo> nerds.
<Kosovo> the lot of them.
<Armads> taking really big atoms and fusing them with other really big atoms
<Armads> and making a bigger one
<Armads> just long enough to say it existed
<Ray> 02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcBm78rpbnI
<Armads> then it breaks down.
<Cone> [1,0You0,4Tube]: The Legend of Awesome | Views: |
<Kosovo> Good for them, I hope they create some neutrinos that could potientally INTERACT WITH REAL MATTER AND DESTROY US ALL UGH NOOOOOO
<Kosovo> lol neutrinos
<Kosovo> they are amazing
<Armads> I really have to wonder what the point is for making synthetic elements lol
<Kosovo> I should make an element
<Kosovo> that breaks down before it's even made. XD
<Armads> rofl
<Kosovo> a half life of -9.8 seconds
<Armads> Well better hurry, or the guys at CERN will beat you to it. XD
<Kosovo> Too late. :(
<Kosovo> They've already made MendelBohorCopernicusium
<Kosovo> that lasts exactly 3.2 X 10 ^-4444444 seconds
<Armads> XD
<Kosovo> too bad, I had some hope there
<Armads> Add one more proton and name it something else.
<Armads> That's what they've been doing lol
<Kosovo> Or neutron, and make a new isotope. XD
<Armads> But then it's still considered the same element :(
<Kosovo> i know
<Kosovo> but it would last even LESS
<Kosovo> which is why its so amazing
<Armads> lol
<Kosovo> 8)
<Kosovo> I'm a nerd with tons of money and something to prove
<Kosovo> so, I'll make all the elements I want
<Armads> I'm just a nerd, so you've got me beat there. rofl
<Kosovo> and be my own master.
<Kosovo> True story. :P
<Kosovo> I was being facetious about the money thing XD
<Kosovo> but if I did have all the money i could want
<Armads> rofl
<Kosovo> i would just start disspointing aspiring scientists
<Armads> I'd pay for college XD;
<Kosovo> by constantly raising the bar
<Kosovo> and crushing their hopes and dreams
<Kosovo> you know
<Armads> I'd want my own space program too.
<Kosovo> ethical goals with no conflict of interest. :D
<Armads> F*cking black holes, how do they work?
<Kosovo> lol, yes
<Armads> I'd have someone check on my crack theories.
<Kosovo> I know how they work, but I were to actually explain it to you, it'd take a few decades
<Armads> like how black holes aren't really holes in the universe and there's no such thing as an event horizon.
<Kosovo> literally. @_@
<Kosovo> true
<Kosovo> they aren't holes
<Kosovo> they are collasped stars with practically infinite density
<Armads> My theory is that the speed of light inside a black hole is different from the speed of light in zero gravity.
<LaptopAristeo> :D
*LaptopAristeo pounces Lambda and Stormy
<Armads> So there is no real "point of no return"
<Armads> since it's already been proven that black holes emit energy and even lose mass.
<Armads> so it's like
<Armads> if the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light, then how fast does stuff go once it's in there?
<Kosovo> well
<Kosovo> anything with mass that starts to approach the speed of light
<Armads> My guess is it still moves at the speed of light, but the speed of light changes because of the spacetime dilation.
<Kosovo> would become heavier and heavier, and denser
<Kosovo> but light itself inside a black hole, I'm not sure
<Ray> 02oh well, Im tired now
<Ray> 02Night
<Kosovo> night ray. :3
<Cone> New post: Re: Starters' English names Revealed by Hooh54 in Pokémon Black and White ( http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6310.msg229037;topicseen#msg229037 )
<Armads> We will be nerds without you. lol
<Kosovo> lol, yeah.
<Ray||ZzZzZzZ> 02good night kosovo
<Kosovo> Something interesting too:
<Kosovo> There IS a solution to division by zero
<Armads> I'm pretty sure the speed of light must change inside a black hole, because the black hole distorts space, and whenever space is distorted, time is distorted too.
<Kosovo> it's just that it's like saying you can solve for a negative radical
<Ray||ZzZzZzZ> 02WAT?
<Armads> So any measure of speed as a function of distance over time must be super relative.
<Kosovo> Yep, that's prolly it
<Kosovo> time is a dimension
<Kosovo> so it can be distorted
<Kosovo> And yes ray
<Kosovo> it's technically infinity
<Armads> But infinity isn't a number so :(
<Kosovo> but anything can become finite if you are an ultra genius. :P
<Kosovo> well
<Kosovo> 8 + 5i isn't a number either. :P
<Kosovo> but it's a solution
<Kosovo> if an imaginary one
<Armads> lol, true
<Kosovo> then again
<Armads> but some super genius has defined i for us
<Armads> and no one's done that yet for 1/0 :(
<Kosovo> Well
<Kosovo> i itself is generally defined as the radical of negative one, or i^2=-1
<Kosovo> but i isn't a real number, obviously
<Kosovo> much like infinity isn't.
<eXAKR> oo
<Armads> But any operation on infinity is infinity, whereas you can still perform operations on i.

<Armads> And get something that's not i, I mean.
<Armads> like i^2 or i^4
<Kosovo> True, I was just gonna say. lol
<Armads> lol
<Kosovo> well, those come out to real numbers
<Kosovo> like
<SheenaFox> !voice
<SheenaFox> Dang it.
<Kosovo> if you took -50^1/2
<Kosovo> you could simplify it
<Kosovo> using both real and imaginary numbers
<Armads> I guess inf/inf could evaluate to 1, but inf * inf would be like lolwut.
<Kosovo> same with something like (-7^1/2 X 4)(-8^1/2 X -8) is
<Kosovo> -is
<Kosovo> lol, true
<Kosovo> I don't think inf X inf would be possible. XD
<Armads> rofl yeah
<Kosovo> or inf/inf for that matter
<Armads> plus it could lead to some weird stuff.
<Armads> Like, if inf * x would evaluate to inf, where x is any given number
<Armads> you could divide both sides by inf and get x = 1.
<Armads> Which I'm pretty sure would blow up the universe.
<Kosovo> that's the problem, I don't think you can divide by infinity
<Kosovo> XD
<Armads> rofl
<Kosovo> even with itself
<Kosovo> since
<Kosovo> infinity has no exact value
<Kosovo> it's just the largest possible number imaginable
<Armads> The largest possible number, factorial. XD;
<Kosovo> then again, mabye
<Kosovo> LOL
<Kosovo> factorial FTW
<Kosovo> seriously
<Kosovo> like
<Kosovo> just writing 240! creates an UNGODLY number
<Kosovo> but like
<Armads> I think my calculator overflows at like 70! rofl
<Kosovo> 5 X 10^5555 ! is prolly like infinity in itself. XD
<Armads> Which is exactly why infinity can't be defined, lol :(
<Armads> 'Cause no matter how big the number is, you can always add 1.
<Kosovo> or divide by 1. XD
<Kosovo> or multiply by 1.
<Armads> Unless you're a 32-bit CPU and can't count higher than 4294967295.
<Kosovo> now I'm just spewing basic algebraic properties, lol
<Armads> lol
<Kosovo> XD
<Kosovo> supercomputers that can perform trillions of calculations per second
<Kosovo> still can't even get close to factorial
<Armads> lol, yeah
<Kosovo> let alone GRAHAM's NUMBER. XD
<Armads> XD
<Kosovo> THAT is a beast, man.
<Armads> I honestly can't even read Graham's number XD
<Armads> it's a number so big they had to come up with a new writing system for it.
<Kosovo> you can't, because it is so large it literally can't be written.
<Kosovo> lol yeah
<Kosovo> not even using exponents raised to exponents
<Kosovo> the most you can do
<Kosovo> is list the ten digits or something. XD
<Armads> lol yeah
<Armads> And the up arrows.
<Armads> it's like
<Armads> "yeah, take this number and make it bigger. Then make it bigger again."
<Armads> that's all I get out of it lol
<Kosovo> I can't even comprehend that system. O_Oo
<Kosovo> the best i can do is exponents raised to exponents, lol
<Armads> same here, hence why I can't read it. lol
<Armads> All I see is arrows.
<Kosovo> but again, it's so large that system is useless
<eXAKR> Graham's number is awesome
<Kosovo> googol doesn't even cut it
<Armads> googol is like nothing lol
<Kosovo> it shivers before grahams number
<Armads> 10^10, lol
<eXAKR> Googol is like nothing next to Graham's number
<Armads> Child's play
<Kosovo> yeah
<eXAKR> Even Googolplex is nothing
<Kosovo> even like 344353453453453! is nothing
<eXAKR> 10^googol
<Armads> Even everything is nothing on Graham's number.
<Armads> It's probably as close to infinity as we've gotten lol
<Kosovo> not even
<Kosovo> our universe is so pathetic
<eXAKR> Indeed
<Kosovo> when we think of numbers like googol
<Kosovo> that
<Kosovo> I can't think of any quantity in the universe
<Kosovo> of like
<Kosovo> ANYTHING
<eXAKR> Only my hatred of the military is larger than Graham's Number
<Kosovo> that equals googol
<Kosovo> even the amount of atoms that exist
<Armads> The amount of atoms observable, at least. lol
<Kosovo> not counting neutrinos and stuff, lol
<Armads> Atoms plus other stuff.
<Kosovo> and antimatter/dark matter, i guess
<Armads> lol yeah
<Armads> Things that aren't atoms.
<eXAKR> by a magnitude so large Graham's Number itself could look smaller than something of a Planck's volume
<Armads> Wonder how many neutrinos are in the universe.
<eXAKR> 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

<Kosovo> ...and heads will explode
<eXAKR> Fail
<Feather> 10Quit
<Armads> Maybe those can compare to G's number then. lol
<Armads> "Every second, about 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through every square centimeter on the part of the Earth that faces the Sun."
<Armads> o.o
<Kosovo> O_o
<eXAKR> 65 billion ONLY?
<Armads> Apparently. lol
<eXAKR> I could have expected a Graham's Number of them passing through a Planck's Volume of the part of Earth that faces the Sun
<eXAKR> ...what
<eXAKR> Maybe that might tear apart the universe
<Cone> New post: Re: If you could do any job, what would you like to do? by EldershadeJerry® in Random Chatter ( http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6287.msg229040;topicseen#msg229040 )
<Kosovo> I love you, Cone
<Kosovo> you do your patriotic duty
<Armads> Uh, Cone doesn't link *every* new post on the forums now, does it? .-.
<Kosovo> to update us on every new post
<Kosovo> yes
<Kosovo> apparently it does now XD
<Armads> I'm already sick of it lol
<Chimera> Bed soon
<Kosovo> lol
<Armads> it is interrupting our nerdular nerdence.
<Kosovo> It's like double the pain
<Kosovo> spam the fourms
<Kosovo> and you spam the chat too, lol
<Kosovo> inb4 destruction of both. XD
<Kosovo> And yes, Armads
<Kosovo> we should not let cone disturb our nerdy discussion. XD
<Armads> lol
<Kosovo> but anyway
<Kosovo> like
<Kosovo> log (-1)
<Kosovo> =best expression ever
<Armads> lol
<Armads> I've never really thought about what my favorite expression would be.
*Armads ponders
<Armads> Sigma's a cool looking operator. lol
<Armads> I pretty much like anything with that in it.
<Kosovo> lol yeah
<Kosovo> how about e
<Kosovo> e gets no love. D:
<Kosovo> no one ever talks about it
<Armads> e or Euler's number? :(
<Armads> I always get those mixed up lol
<Kosovo> yes, i think
<Kosovo> where e is about 2.71
<Armads> ah, that one.
<Kosovo> where when written as log base e or LN
<Armads> I never learned much about logs, so I don't work with e too much :(
<Kosovo> it is the natural logarithm
<Armads> All I know is that like, every other digit is an 8. lol
<Armads> Oh wait, the other one is Euler's *constant*.
<Armads> because having two different things named Euler's number and Euler's constant isn't confusing at all.
<Armads> :|
<WontBeUsed> whats up
<WontBeUsed> ...
<WontBeUsed> anyone on?
<Kosovo> lol
<WontBeUsed> hey what happend to SpyroRocks?
<Kosovo> Logarithms are awesome.
<WontBeUsed> .....
<WontBeUsed> :/
<Kosovo> Especially about condensing/expanding them
<Armads> The only experience I have with them is with bit calculations. lol
<Armads> And even then I didn't know it was a logarithm.
<Kosovo> like you can write log3 (x+1) - log3 (y-8) as log3 (x+1/y-8)
<Kosovo> and that's the extremely simple example, lol
<Armads> I think it was b = log(n-1), where n is the highest number you can represent with b bits.
<Armads> Or I'm probably mixing that up somehow because I never really learned it XD
<Armads> ...yeah according to my calculator I'm like ass wrong on that. lol
<Kosovo> XD
<Kosovo> calculators can be totally retarded sometimes, lol
<WontBeUsed> uhmmm...
<Armads> Well I know all the powers of 2 up to 10 by heart, so whatev. lol
<WontBeUsed> :s
<Kosovo> bogus domain errors out the ass all the time. XD
<Armads> That should be as high as I need to go without some kind of tool.
<Armads> At which point I can just do 2^n or something.
<Armads> I like how most of the math I know is related only to programming. lol
<Kosovo> I need to learn some l33t programming skills from you, lol.
<Kosovo> I aim to either compose music for games or be a history professor
<Kosovo> so
<Armads> rofl
<Armads> Do you play any instruments?
<Kosovo> not particularly, besides like a harmonica and clarinent, lol
<Armads> rofl
<Armads> That's one more instrument than me XD
<Armads> I can play the piano to some degree, but only because it's a lot like typing. rofl
<Armads> or rather, I think of it like typing.
<Armads> Being an audio programmer could be something else I could get into, so maybe you can come and work with me then =P
<Armads> Right now I'm just looking into AI and physics, and maybe fancy new input devices.
<Armads> I have a friend who can program wiimotes and I've heard Kinect is pretty easy to wire into a program too.
<Kosovo> XD
<WontBeUsed> am i the only one on?
<Swaffy> Hmm ... Is anyone here?
<Kosovo> that's awesome
<WontBeUsed> whats up
<Kosovo> physics?
<Swaffy> Hey.
<Kosovo> like a phsyics engine in a game or phsysics in general?
<Armads> Only physics as it relates to games, mind you XD
<WontBeUsed> are you a Spyro fan?
<Swaffy> Just playin' around with an Xbox Arcade Indy game.
<Kosovo> ah
<Swaffy> Yes, I am.
<Swaffy> I love Spyro.
<WontBeUsed> NICE almost everyone on this site hardly is
<Swaffy> Yeah.
<Swaffy> I don't get why, though.
<WontBeUsed> i k now right
<Armads> Still way more advanced than what I did in high school, but probably not too similar to physics at a regular college.
<Swaffy> This is called "SpyroChat
<Swaffy> "
<WontBeUsed> haha yeah
<Armads> RK4 integration and stuff.
<WontBeUsed> oh so you got an Xbox?
<Swaffy> Yes, I do.
<WontBeUsed> nice
<Armads> also RK4 is like my favorite name for a formula ever.
<Swaffy> I love these things.
<WontBeUsed> what things?
<Swaffy> Xbox 360
<WontBeUsed> oh
<Swaffy> Sorry man.
<WontBeUsed> about what?
<Swaffy> The confusion.
<WontBeUsed> oh
<WontBeUsed> ha dont trip
<Swaffy> I won't
<WontBeUsed> anyway iv got a PS3 and please dont mistake me for a fanboy
<Swaffy> I just ate a big block of cheese. I'm happy, heheh.
<Kosovo> lol
<Swaffy> Aah, a PS3.
<WontBeUsed> nice i just got home from walmart
<Kosovo> your high school must have had actual options.
<WontBeUsed> lol you dont like ps3s?
<Kosovo> unlike mine.
<Swaffy> Do you play it?
<WontBeUsed> yeah
<Kosovo> Mine has been rendered absolutely pathetic by budget cuts
<WontBeUsed> from time to time im sometimes bussy
<Swaffy> Alright.
<WontBeUsed> right now im kinda working but im almost done
<Kosovo> even core academic classes are being cut. :/
<WontBeUsed> so i think ima finish up tommarow
<Swaffy> Working where?
<Kosovo> let alone classes for, like programming
<Kosovo> *like,
<Swaffy> Or is it school related?
<WontBeUsed> i make invatations
<Armads> lol :(
<Swaffy> Sweet.
<Armads> Doesn't mean I didn't hate high school lol
<WontBeUsed> yeah the pay isnt amazing but it gets me by
<Swaffy> What's your age?
<WontBeUsed> 18
<Armads> In fact I think I hated it because it was too easy.
<Swaffy> You should be fine, then.
<Kosovo> I didn't mind hating high school necessarily
<Kosovo> *mean
<Swaffy> Wow, I need to update my age on my profile.
<WontBeUsed> yeah for a while im about to turn 19
<WontBeUsed> how old r u?
<Swaffy> It says 17[3/4] years old. I'm 19.
<WontBeUsed> nice
<Kosovo> I meant actually being able to start attaining skills for a career in high school
<WontBeUsed> when ur birthday?
<Swaffy> I haven't updated my profile in about 1.25 years.
<Armads> That I didn't do at all XD
<WontBeUsed> dang
<Kosovo> and yeah, high school is too easy for the most part. lol :/
<Swaffy> Sep. 9th
<Swaffy> 9-9-91
<Armads> My high school(s) were like, soooo boringly easy and pointless.
<WontBeUsed> oh so you just turned
<WontBeUsed> ha thats kinda tipy
<Swaffy> ABout 3 months ago, yes.
<Armads> Most everything I learned during those four years I was just learning on my own time. lol
<WontBeUsed> ima turn on april 4th
<Swaffy> That's an odd date.
<WontBeUsed> y?
<Armads> 'Cause I sure as heck didn't spend that time doing homework. XD
<Swaffy> April fools jokes would hit you like a hammer.
<Swaffy> .'/
<WontBeUsed> ha
<WontBeUsed> sometimes not always
<Swaffy> Great.
<Kosovo> lol
<WontBeUsed> what?
<Armads> College is cool and I'm actually kinda sad that I'm almost done. lol :(
<Swaffy> That would suck having your birthday while everyone keeps making those stupid jokes.
<Kosovo> :/
<Kosovo> I know this is unrelated with regards to education
<WontBeUsed> haha i dont mind Im a pretty strong guy people dont really like to mess with me so its cool
<Kosovo> but is the college atmosphere the same as high school?
<Armads> God no. XD
<Armads> Not this college, that's for sure at least.
<Swaffy> Oh, alright.
<Armads> The people here have personality, for one thing.
<WontBeUsed> yeah, so im just wondering for the sake of asking, How big of a spyro fan are you?
<Swaffy> I'm going to update my profile in a second.
<Swaffy> How big?
<WontBeUsed> ight
<Swaffy> I've loved Spyro and the Spyro games since I was 9.
<WontBeUsed> yeah like- kinda/big fan/EXTREAM
<Swaffy> I began playing them when I was 8 or 9.
<Armads> We don't have those annoying one-armed desks either.
<Swaffy> Extreme.
<Armads> I hated those.
<WontBeUsed> ha same here i played Spyro from a demo Pizza hut gave out
<Swaffy> I guess you could say.
<Armads> ...and still do lol
<WontBeUsed> nice same here i just dont like the 1st ps2 spyro games
<Swaffy> My first Spyro game is Spyro: Year of the Dragon. I torrented Spyro 1 and 2 earlier this year.
<Kosovo> lol
<Kosovo> because
<Kosovo> like
<eXAKR> bbl
<WontBeUsed> oh
<Swaffy> So you like the "The Legend of Spyro" series?
<Kosovo> if people in college developed that same stupid-as-hell social ladder that exists in high school
<Kosovo> then I wouldn't even bother
<WontBeUsed> Yeah i dont hate it, i like the story... kinda
<WontBeUsed> i think i could have written a better story and made a better gameplay enviornment
<Swaffy> Then what's your favorite Spyro game?
<Armads> There's still a bit of a social ladder here, but it's more like
<Armads> if you're smart enough to know it's there, you're probably at the top of it.
<WontBeUsed> spyro year of the dragon and Spyro Eternal Night
<Swaffy> Aah, yes.
<Swaffy> This Broken Soul is a beautiful song.
<Swaffy> From The Eternal Night's ending credits.
<WontBeUsed> YEAH
<Armads> It's a law of the universe that there's always "that guy" wherever you go, but it's a lot easier to put up with idiots when you're around more people who aren't idiots.
<WontBeUsed> i got it on my ps3
<Kosovo> true.
<Armads> Even the teachers here aren't all that much different from the students.
<Swaffy> If it was released on Xbox Original, I would play it more often, but the only console it is on that my family owns is the Wii. I really don't like Wiis.
<Armads> You can talk to them and joke around with them just like anyone else.
<WontBeUsed> haha i understand not liking the wii
<Swaffy> So I play it every once in a while.
<Kosovo> lol, I'd always imagine my professors being these strict old white man that are all stiff and have a long cane to smack people in the face with. XD
<Armads> rofl, not at this school XD
<Kosovo> But that's cool that you had professors that were relatable
<WontBeUsed> yeah i got Spyro 1 2 and 3 for the ps1 on the ps3
<Armads> In fact only one of my teachers was even over 50.
<Swaffy> Sweet.
<Armads> Most are probably in their 30s or younger.
<Kosovo> Wow, really? O_o
<Armads> Really XD
<WontBeUsed> had it on my psp but i cant play games while i am moving i get sick
<Swaffy> I play them on my laptop using an outstanding program called ePSXe, which is pretty much a PS1 console on your computer.
<Armads> You seriously can't spot them in a crowd.
<Kosovo> That's the age range at my school for the most part actually
<Kosovo> but in a college?...I didn't expect that. O_o
<WontBeUsed> i bet you need some kind of gaming computer or a high tec computer
<Swaffy> So I play all of my PS1 games using it.
<Armads> If it weren't for the color of their lanyards, they'd blend in perfectly with the students.
<Kosovo> for teachers, i mean
<Swaffy> I don't.
<WontBeUsed> then what do you use?
<WontBeUsed> i got a toshiba Laptop so i dought i can use it
<Armads> Heck, some of the supervisors there *are* students XD
<WontBeUsed> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8v7UOXxF0c&feature=related
<Kosovo> lol
<WontBeUsed> that was how i got my 1st spyro
<Kosovo> that sounds like a very well blended community to me
<Kosovo> where people are easily relatable to one another
<Kosovo> regardless of age/position
<Armads> yeah, it's awesome here.
<Kosovo> That's basically my dream college, lol
<Armads> Like, one of my teachers this month just reformatted his computer
<Swaffy> I have a Dell laptop with an i3 Processor. Not sure how much RAM it has.
<Armads> and then the class had a nice discussion over what he should have installed first, Minecraft or WoW.
<WontBeUsed> its cool i dont get a tec into computers anyway
<WontBeUsed> just photoshop
<Swaffy> "Embedding disabled by request."
<Armads> Like, before he even installed his work software or an antivirus.
<Armads> He installed Minecraft.
<WontBeUsed> aww wack
<Kosovo> XD
<Kosovo> Wow
<Kosovo> that is awesome.
<Kosovo> like
<Kosovo> I can't imagine my spanish teacher EVER doing that. XD
<Kosovo> *past
<Armads> rofl
<Swaffy> I clicked "Pop Out" and I got to watch it.
<Swaffy> Sweet, it's Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage.
<WontBeUsed> yea
<Kosovo> Well
<Swaffy> And Tetris.
<Swaffy> Awesome.
<Kosovo> I love my school and all
<Kosovo> in terms of hertiage and blah blah
<Armads> I don't think any of my high school teachers even played games.
<Swaffy> How old were you when you first got your Spyro game?
<Kosovo> but the atmosphere sucks
<Kosovo> and so do a lot of the people. :/
<WontBeUsed> not sure
<Armads> lol :(
<Swaffy> Oh, alright.
<Kosovo> I know you live in Florida and all
<Kosovo> but
<Swaffy> Wait ... are you in the British Isles?
<Kosovo> When people say there are budget cuts in californian schools
<WontBeUsed> .no im American
<Kosovo> they MEAN it to the highest degree
<Swaffy> Oh, so it's night time.
<Armads> D:
<WontBeUsed> well im actually Mexican but i live in America
<Kosovo> I should know, I'm in our school's asb.
<Swaffy> Alright.
<WontBeUsed> yeah its 10:37
<Kosovo> I take part in managing our fiances and whatnot.
<Swaffy> It's 12:37 AM here in Texas.
<Armads> ah :(
<Kosovo> We have almost nothing to work with, at all. :/
<WontBeUsed> TX??/!!! WHAT PART
<WontBeUsed> ??
<WontBeUsed> !!
<Kosovo> a lot of the money actuallly comes from our own pockets
<Swaffy> What? ... What state are you in?
<Armads> fail D:
<Kosovo> yeah
<WontBeUsed> Ca but i used to live in HOUSTON TX
<Kosovo> it's that bad
<Swaffy> Oh.
<Swaffy> I'm about 2 hours SouthWest.
<Kosovo> like
<WontBeUsed> i also lived in Tomball tx
<Swaffy> San Antonio.
<Kosovo> it's part of the reason why people nowadays don't even care. :/
<Kosovo> the droppout rate is increasing rapidly
<Armads> I'd imagine so lol :(
<Armads> I never got involved with anything in grade school because I never cared enough.
<WontBeUsed> iv been there i was in citywalk, when to sea world and saw the alamo
<Armads> I never felt like school was doing anything for me.
<WontBeUsed> its dope
<Kosovo> yeah
<Swaffy> Are you a city person, suburbs person, or country person?
<Kosovo> same here
<Armads> Granted I didn't drop out, but I did hate it enough to want to. lol
<WontBeUsed> all of them
<WontBeUsed> i move... ALOT
<WontBeUsed> but i love the City most then Country
<Swaffy> What I mean is, whixh do you like most?
<WontBeUsed> i HATE the subs
<Swaffy> Aah, okay.
<WontBeUsed> and you??
<Kosovo> D:
<Swaffy> I'm more of a country person, but dislike country music and live in the suburbs.
<Kosovo> In fact
<Kosovo> just today, we were totally yelled at in our asb period
<Swaffy> I'm a naturalist. I love being around nature.
<WontBeUsed> ha same i hate country (besides Johny Chase's song Wont Back Down)
<Swaffy> And Cration.
<Kosovo> because we had an event on saturday where a lot of our staff left early
<Kosovo> because they were fed up
<WontBeUsed> yeah i like nature but i also know it has a deadly side and i can never keep that out of my head
<Armads> XD :(
<Armads> that's awesomely horrible lol
<Kosovo> lol, yeah.
<Swaffy> Yes, true. But if you know where to go, it's very nice.
<Kosovo> the president herself even started crying over it
<Kosovo> and she blamed us for the whole school's problems
<Kosovo> or at least partly
<Armads> lol
<Swaffy> Not like you'd hop onto a raft and chill out in an alligator-infested swamp.
<Armads> I know what kind of job I don't want lol :(
<WontBeUsed> haha i have (believe it or not) IN SAN ANTONIO
<WontBeUsed> no joke complete accident

<Kosovo> when i get the money to move to the other side of the country. XD
<Armads> That's the spirit 8D
<Swaffy> Oh, I was getting worried.
<WontBeUsed> ha
<Swaffy> Sorry I had a late reply. I just finished installing a mod for my PC game.
<Kosovo> :B
<WontBeUsed> oh
<Swaffy> It was in three separate parts for its installation. Three separate downloads.
<Kosovo> or I can move to, like, nepal
<Swaffy> They took about an hour + each to download for that one mod.
<Kosovo> and learn yoga
<Kosovo> and meditate for the rest of my life
<Armads> lol
<Kosovo> but nah
<WontBeUsed> DANG Mod for what game?
<Kosovo> sounds boring :P
<Armads> Or you could just find a place in your town that teaches it :(
<Swaffy> Battlefield 1942.
<WontBeUsed> oh neverplayed it
<WontBeUsed> do you know how to hack COD: MW2

<Kosovo> I just don't wanna spend the money. XD

<Armads> but never got far XD
<Swaffy> Think of it this way [and this is a small reason I don't like them]: They have terrible servers, they have too many glitches, and they are too easy to hack into.
<WontBeUsed> BLACK ops is the best because if all the customs
*LL growls
<Kosovo> XD
<LL> it froze
<LL> on me 2 times
<LL> >>;
<LL> anyway
<Kosovo> Just being a yellow belt proves you've tried, at least.
<WontBeUsed> idk how to hack into it but i heard its easyer to hack into it on Xbox360
<LL> I'm a black-belt
<LL> but
<Swaffy> ... But I do like the Zombies mode.
<LL> physically weak oxo
<Armads> My muscles get all tight now because I don't practice.
<WontBeUsed> the worst we get is elevating
<LL> lol
<WontBeUsed> i suck at Zombies
<LL> I'm flexible tho~
<Kosovo> I actually USED my tae kwon do knowledge once.
<Swaffy> Wellm skilled or not, it could be quite fun. But I enjoy Halo's "Flood" more.
<Armads> I can kick about as high as my face but that's it. lol
<Kosovo> It was hilarious/terrifying
<Armads> I punched a guy once, it was just hilarious.
<WontBeUsed> you got halo Reach?
<Swaffy> Yes.
<Kosovo> I was actually being pinned down in this alley
<WontBeUsed> Me and my friend play that game alot
<Kosovo> and when I was able to break free
*Light_Latias ...
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Light_Latias03)02WB* - <Light_Latias> 12Chaos, panic, and disorder. My work here is done~
<Swaffy> It's a great game, other than the Matchmaking.
<Light_Latias> one
<Light_Latias> last
<Kosovo> I side kicked a guy in the face. XD
<Light_Latias> chance
<WontBeUsed> im alright but if i dont constantly play i get rusty fast
<Armads> rofl :(
*Light_Latias o-o
<Swaffy> Indeed.
<Swaffy> I agree.
<Armads> I always carry a knife when I go out.
<Kosovo> I think I saw blood.
<Light_Latias> I got bruises every night
<Light_Latias> I was @karate
<Kosovo> Never seen him again
<Armads> lol
<WontBeUsed> its cool but i hate how only the alians can dodge row
<Kosovo> I had no idea why he pinned me down in the first place, lol
<Armads> Well, that's what martial arts are for :D
<Swaffy> row?
<Kosovo> maybe it was because he wanted my groceries. XD
<Armads> rofl
<WontBeUsed> if they had that spartens should have also had an exclusive
<WontBeUsed> evade
<Kosovo> yams are pretty valuable
<Swaffy> Oh.
<Armads> hey, muggers need to eat too :P
<Armads> yams are awesome.
<Kosovo> true.
<Kosovo> YES.
<Swaffy> Elites had evade since Halo 1.
<Kosovo> Yams=best thing ever
<Armads> Heck, I'd mug a guy in a back alley for a bag of yams.
<Armads> lol
<Swaffy> It's part of their character and personality.
<Swaffy> Spartans just run in with guns blazing.
<Kosovo> lol
<WontBeUsed> yeah but what do the spartens have that elites dont?
<Swaffy> Very fast bullets.
<WontBeUsed> elites can do that too
<WontBeUsed> elites can take human weapons
<Swaffy> Excluding the Needle Rifle.
<Kosovo> I'm making canolis tomorrow
<WontBeUsed> (love that gun)
<Kosovo> for fun. :B
<Kosovo> *cannolis
<Armads> :o
<Armads> I'm gonna try my hand at mochi again once I get the proper tools.
<WontBeUsed> do you play FallOut: New Vegas?
<Armads> ie, cheese cloth and a real mortar and pestle.
<Swaffy> I think Spartans just have more brute force, but I have always like elites more.
<WontBeUsed> or FallOut: 3
<Kosovo> XD
<Swaffy> No, sorry.
<Swaffy> But i do like them.
<Kosovo> Mortar and pestle=epic
<WontBeUsed> WHAT!!!!!???
<WontBeUsed> FALLOUT FTW!!!
<Armads> Even if I fail at it, those things make a heck of a kitchen ornament.
<Swaffy> I have watched my friend play them quite a few times, and have played it myself a few times.
<Armads> like "check me out, I have a f*cking MORTAR AND PESTLE because I'm such a gangsta."
<WontBeUsed> its diffrent when its your game tho
<Kosovo> XD
<Swaffy> Yes, it is.
<Kosovo> I should tell that to the gangs that live in my neighborhood, lol.
<Swaffy> I like how Fallout NV provides iron sights for weapons.
<WontBeUsed> i got my fallout New Vegas with the Limited Edition box
<Armads> rofl
<Kosovo> "Hey, motherf******s"
<Kosovo> "What?"
<Kosovo> "guess what I got?"
<WontBeUsed> yeah FallOut 3 didnt have that
<Kosovo> "What?"
<WontBeUsed> real useful
<Kosovo> "A MOTHERF****** MORTAR AND PESTLE."
<Armads> SH*T JUST GOT REAL
<Kosovo> God forbid rice gets involved
<WontBeUsed> anyway so your 19, how many fights have you been in?
<Armads> Rice is awesoooome.
<Kosovo> THEN sh*t gets escalated man
<WontBeUsed> again just asking for the sake of asking
<Kosovo> lol, so true.
<Armads> I wonder what happens if I try to grind white rice instead of mochi rice.
<Armads> Theoretically it should still taste like rice.
<Swaffy> I frown upon people who fight. But to answer your question, I was dragged into about three in my life.
<Swaffy> All in middle school.
<Kosovo> theoretically, of course.
<WontBeUsed> oh, i used to be a real big fighter (not my choice)
<Armads> We all know how theories end up working out. lol
<Swaffy> I have better, more productive things to do with my life then to waste time fighting people.
<Kosovo> lol
<Kosovo> you never know. :o
<Armads> Theoretically I should have been able to grind rice with my hands. XD
<WontBeUsed> ouch that hurt lol
<Armads> I did NOT know what I was up against there. XD
<Swaffy> Not to be mean to you.
<Kosovo> You cannot deny the rice.
<Kosovo> It will only deny you.
<Armads> The above statement is true.
<Kosovo> XD
<WontBeUsed> wana at least know what drove me to be a fighter?
<Swaffy> Some people grow up in an environment like that. I feel bad for those people.
<Armads> I was denied by the rice
<Swaffy> Sure, I'll listen.
<Armads> it asserted its authority over me and I was powerless to resist.
<WontBeUsed> well i was born in San Branidino CA
<WontBeUsed> lived in the getto then moved to Fontana Lived in the not so getto
<Armads> But, it was a fierce and delicious struggle.
<Kosovo> indeed
<Kosovo> if resistance was actually possible
<Swaffy> [read]
<WontBeUsed> but when i turned to a teen ager i moved to tombal tx
<Kosovo> the rice would have to take sh*t into it's own hands. :/
<Kosovo> but it doesnt have to.
<Armads> its own very sticky and pasty hands.
<Kosovo> indeed.
<WontBeUsed> thats when i was introduced to Racism
<Swaffy> Oh, alright.
<Armads> I wonder if you could make glue out of that stuff.
<WontBeUsed> white people where the majority they hated me
<Kosovo> Possibly, lol.
<WontBeUsed> black people hated me
<Kosovo> I know you can probably make chaulk out of it. XD
<Armads> I should order a larger bag of it next time and play around with it more. lol
<WontBeUsed> and on the 1st day of school i got in a fight with a popular Mexican so Hispanics HATED me
<Kosovo> lol
<Swaffy> That's terrible.
<Armads> Two pounds just isn't enough it seems.
<WontBeUsed> yeah sucked
<Kosovo> Nope.
<Swaffy> So what is it like now?
<Kosovo> You need a googol amount of it.
<WontBeUsed> anyway my parents broke up and i moved
<Kosovo> in kilograms.
<WontBeUsed> to Houston Tx
<Swaffy> Is your life better now?
<WontBeUsed> yeah
<Armads> More stuff needs to be measured in SI units :\
<WontBeUsed> in Houston the majorty of people where Black
<Swaffy> That's nice at least.
<Kosovo> XD
<Swaffy> Yes, it's like that.
<WontBeUsed> they had a gang or click
<WontBeUsed> nope
<Swaffy> Nope?
<Kosovo> I only think of things using customary units, even when I know the metric system. lol
<WontBeUsed> to get in you had to Jump a lot of mexicans or stab 1 mexican to get in
<Kosovo> miles>kilometers in my brain
<WontBeUsed> My skin color made me a target
<Armads> lol
<Swaffy> You didn't try to get in, did you?
<Swaffy> Oh.
<Kosovo> sorry for cutting off short
<Armads> Well, miles > kilometers in a mathematical sense too =P
<Kosovo> true, actually XD
<WontBeUsed> but it was my homie puff that got stabed
<Swaffy> Did he live?
<Kosovo> I gotta get some sleep. It's getting late here. @_@
<WontBeUsed> thats what opend my eyes even more to my hostal contentment
<Armads> lol :(
<WontBeUsed> envornment
<Kosovo> and I have to get to school earlier than usually tomorrow...so... XD
<WontBeUsed> not contentment
<Armads> lol, I can relate
<Kosovo> School sucks, honestly.
<Kosovo> for the most part
<Armads> High school yeah D:
<Swaffy> It would do the same for me. I would probably just leave that place.
<Armads> well, g'night bromine o/
<Kosovo> lol
<WontBeUsed> so i always jumped people who put red cloths on and i was jumped and nearly stabed many times
*Armads shot
<Kosovo> XDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Kosovo> I will remember to use that IRL
<Kosovo> that is hilarious
<Armads> rofl
<Kosovo> anyway, night armads XD
<Swaffy> Thank God you never got stabbed.
<WontBeUsed> my homies and me always stuck close to one another
<Swaffy> Yeah.
<WontBeUsed> i know right :)
<Armads> night lol
<WontBeUsed> so other Hispanics started to want to get in our group
<WontBeUsed> soon we became known and people started to Say that Me my homie puff and my other homie Chito where the HEADS of this Click
<Swaffy> Of that gang?
<WontBeUsed> man word gets by quick in the streets let me tell you that
<WontBeUsed> not a gang
<WontBeUsed> or at least i didnt mean to make one
<Swaffy> That sucks.
<WontBeUsed> yeah
<WontBeUsed> the worst part was when i was going out with my 1st love
<WontBeUsed> Diana
<WontBeUsed> she was everything to me
<Swaffy> Because you're 18, are you in college, out of school, or still in Senipr High
<Swaffy> ?
<WontBeUsed> im in HS
<Swaffy> Okay.
<Swaffy> Back to what oyu were saying?
<WontBeUsed> So Diana became a BIG target (i didnt know)
<WontBeUsed> and those low life scum actually put their hands on them
<WontBeUsed> her not them
<WontBeUsed> sorry im getting emotional and my typing starts to l suk
<Swaffy> Get the gun.
<WontBeUsed> didnt have one
<WontBeUsed> but that does come into play later
<Swaffy> Take your time, brother.
<WontBeUsed> i looked at her... i saw the mess they made out of someone i truly cared about
<WontBeUsed> the blood falling from hur eye
<Swaffy> No ... .'/
<WontBeUsed> the anger that manifested in side me was uncontrollable
<WontBeUsed> the next day i was at the park (Crying so know one sees me at home)
<WontBeUsed> and i saw a black guy wearing red.
<WontBeUsed> he started to call out soowoo (their gang word or something)
<WontBeUsed> i turned to him and he reconized me even tho p i had vever seen him in my life
<Swaffy> .'/
<WontBeUsed> he pulled a knife on me but he was holding it wrong so i knocked it out of his hand before he got a good grip on it
<WontBeUsed> i beat the living shit out of im
<Swaffy> : )
<WontBeUsed> hitting him on the head on the same spot for what felt like hours
<WontBeUsed> i thought he was dead he stoped moving
<Swaffy> It's wrong to take revenge on someone, but I understand your feelings and what caused you to do that.
<WontBeUsed> he didnt even straggle anymore
<WontBeUsed> i dragged him to a ditch and left him there, i didnt hear about it, but i still asumed he was dead
<WontBeUsed> i was scared out of my mind thinking every cop as out looking for me
<WontBeUsed> but he lived it was just my mind pushing my worst fear
<Swaffy> He may have been found by his friends.
<WontBeUsed> yeah he was...
<WontBeUsed> weeks later
<Swaffy> Now I'm worried again.
<WontBeUsed> i was walking down the same park to go home
<WontBeUsed> late at night might i add
<Swaffy> ... even worse.
<WontBeUsed> with my younger brother
<WontBeUsed> we had just left a little party with my homies
<WontBeUsed> but the park is still kind of far. so anyway we saw a car pass by we didnt think much about it untill it stopped
<Swaffy> I'd be runnung.
<Swaffy> *running
<WontBeUsed> when in turned the corner and drove slowly
<WontBeUsed> then not when
<WontBeUsed> the passenger shot at us
<WontBeUsed> me and my brother got low laying down taking cover from some hills
<WontBeUsed> i thought the bullet was going to go through the grass like butter and kill me but it didnt
<WontBeUsed> as soon as the driver drove away i told my brother to run and call the homies, i didnt need to tell him twice
<Swaffy> They must've been 9mm rounds.
<WontBeUsed> i got up and ran the other direcition
<WontBeUsed> they followed me took a few other shots and got out of they car
<WontBeUsed> (im guessing they ran out of ammo
<WontBeUsed> )
<Swaffy> They could have ...
<WontBeUsed> i was so enraged i turned around and started fighting the closest one
<WontBeUsed> i should have thought about it, but i didnt
<Swaffy> It's hard to think in a situation like that. I know I wouldn't be able to./
<Swaffy> I might have died.
<WontBeUsed> i soon found my self out numbered my body on the hard street
<WontBeUsed> they all took shots at my jaw and ribs
<WontBeUsed> (my jaw is still messed up and pops out of place from time to time)
<WontBeUsed> my ribs werent broken but they felt like they where
<Swaffy> Internal bruising.
<WontBeUsed> Lucky for my my brother showed up with my homies
<WontBeUsed> yeah i had that
<WontBeUsed> as soon as those chicken shits saw a truck full of mexicans they got in their car and left
<WontBeUsed> my friends came to my aid
<WontBeUsed> took me to a hospital and everything
<WontBeUsed> the doc said my jaw was dislocated and my ribs had internal bleeding
<Swaffy> Crap.
<WontBeUsed> oh and something hit my right eye
<Swaffy> What?
<WontBeUsed> so i was blind from my right eye for about 3 weeks
<Swaffy> Was it bleeding?
<WontBeUsed> ha i was soo f'ed up That the doc said
<WontBeUsed> " you might be perminatly blind from your right eye"
<WontBeUsed> my responce was
<WontBeUsed> "aww shit for how long?
<Swaffy> I'm just glad they didn't shoot you ... the gang.
<WontBeUsed> yeah i think thats what hit my eye, not the bullet but maybe the bullet hit the floor and some concret or something hit my eye
<Swaffy> Was it automatic or semi-auto?
<Swaffy> [the weapon]
<WontBeUsed> it was a pistol 9mm im sure cuz it wasnt so loud when the shots fired
<Swaffy> Oh.
<Mikey> anyone still here
<Lambda> yo
<WontBeUsed> but i didnt get a good look at the gun i just saw that it was black
<Swaffy> Where was your family during all of this?
<Mikey> oh hi
<Mikey> what's up
<WontBeUsed> home
<Swaffy> Great.
<Lambda> bleh
<Lambda> essay
<Lambda> you?
<Mikey> I'm sicker than ever
<WontBeUsed> my mom found out about the shotting cuz of the hospital bill
<Mikey> I was throwing up all morning and now I keep getting too warm and I'm afraid to eat and I'm still coughing from bronchitis
<Swaffy> That's what I figured.
<Mikey> so
<WontBeUsed> and she moved me out to Ontario Ca with my sister
<Mikey> yeah
<Swaffy> To a safer place.
<Lambda> D:
<WontBeUsed> yeah way safer but i wasnt in my envornment any more
<Swaffy> I'm glad you got moved out of there, personally.
<WontBeUsed> thanks
<WontBeUsed> and as weired or stupid as it sounds...
<Swaffy> Who knows ... you could have holes in you right now ...
<WontBeUsed> i still want to go back
<Swaffy> What do you miss?
<WontBeUsed> my friends... they where like brothers to me...
<Swaffy> It's such a hard life to live, though.
<WontBeUsed> and revenge is another thing on my list... Mexicans out there still getting gutted for that stupid gang
<Swaffy> Wow.
<Swaffy> I understand.
<WontBeUsed> life is hard but i always felt i had a warrior inside of me, and this warrior wants blood through sweet revenge no matter what the coast is
<WontBeUsed> but my vision is starting to fade the warrior is dying im starting to make a new life...
<WontBeUsed> as hard as it is to admit im not the same person, im not as strong, im not as fast and i dont know much about the Houston Streets anymore
<Swaffy> Maybe that's a good thing.
<WontBeUsed> i just get updated by my homie chito everytime someone dies.
<WontBeUsed> a goodthing, im not even sure what that is anymore
<WontBeUsed> after what happend to Diana im to scared to love anyone anymore
<WontBeUsed> 2 or 3 years now... but im starting to get over it
<WontBeUsed> slowly the wound heals
<Swaffy> I hope you don't mind me sharing this.
<Swaffy> Hold a sec ...
<WontBeUsed> alright
<Swaffy> http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:38-42&version=NLT
<Swaffy> I'm a Christian, and feel the need to have you read that.
<WontBeUsed> i knew you where Christian
<Swaffy> There's always Forgiveness, though.
<WontBeUsed> and i knew you would give the the word of the bible
<Swaffy> Is that a bad thing?
<WontBeUsed> nope
<Swaffy> Oh.
<Swaffy> Sweet.
<WontBeUsed> im Christan to... makes things complicated
<Swaffy> Indeed.
<WontBeUsed> but its something i TRULY need
<Swaffy> what is?
<WontBeUsed> Jesus
<WontBeUsed> i used to say "im not Jesus i wont forgive"
<Swaffy> I can only imagine how peaceful this world would be if everyone followed Christ.
<WontBeUsed> but i am his follower
<Swaffy> I hear you. I have thought that before. I've hated someone, unfortunately.
<Swaffy> But decide to let it go.
<WontBeUsed> good
<Mikey> yeah and I had a prescription for the medicine last week but it didn't work so now I have to see the doctor again tomorrow ughh
<Swaffy> I've put saws up to people's neck. It's not something to enjoy talking about.
<WontBeUsed> i still live with guilt and it feels bad to pray knowing i hate and as for GOD to forgive me
<WontBeUsed> have you killed?
<Swaffy> In my head, yes. In the material world, I'm glad I have not.
<Swaffy> Here's something I am glad about:
<Swaffy> I grew up in a family of worship leaders.
<Swaffy> My mother and father grew up playing instruments and singing in worshipbands since I was born, and so I have lived my life as a Christian and going to church.
<WontBeUsed> Nice
<Swaffy> I was [and still am] an Introvert, so I kept all of my feelings inside of me.
<Swaffy> I went to public school my whole life until high school.
<Swaffy> I have one sibling, a sister. She joined her first worship band in her high school year before I joined my first band.
<Swaffy> in elementary school,
<Swaffy> I was a nerdy kid who never got respect and had only two friends. They have been my friends since they were born.
<Swaffy> Middle school, I was just a normal kid who cursed in every sentence.
<WontBeUsed> i think we all go through that stage
<Swaffy> Yeah.
<Swaffy> High School was when my life began to turn around.
<Swaffy> Crap, forgot.
<Swaffy> When I was young, My best friend was Spyro.
<Swaffy> Anyway ...
<Swaffy> .'/
<Swaffy> I joined my private school's worship band.
<WontBeUsed> what spyro was my friend to and so was Crash and Later on Jak and Dexter
<Swaffy> I got my first guitar when my grandfather died from a stroke. He passed it on. It's an old Gibson from the early '70s.
<WontBeUsed> Dang!
<Swaffy> So I decided to learn guitar. I eventually joined the youth band and the Sunday worship band that plays for the main service.
<Swaffy> So I was in three worship bands until I graduated high school and left the school band.
<Swaffy> I plan on going to college and becoming a worship pastor or something related to that.
<WontBeUsed> nice
<Swaffy> My sister grew up with me as my role model.
<Swaffy> She was always showing me how to be nicer to people.
<Mikey> well I'm gonna try and attempt to sleep so seeya
<Swaffy> She would hit me, I would hit her, and she would be the one that gets in trouble.
<Swaffy> Wait ... I was the one that enjoyed hitting her. Crap.
<WontBeUsed> jst askin but is ur sister still alive?
*Swaffy can't think straight
<Swaffy> Yes.
<Swaffy> She's 20
*WontBeUsed understands
<Swaffy> My main point ...
<Swaffy> She began dating my friend's brother a few months back, then about two weeks ago found that she was pregnant.
<WontBeUsed> :S
<WontBeUsed> :s
<Swaffy> My parents and I then found out that most of her relationship was a sexual relationship. Not only do I distrust her now, but I lost my role model.
<WontBeUsed> dang
<Swaffy> So she's officially stupid ... heh.
<WontBeUsed> that sucks
<Swaffy> She had a miscarriage.
<WontBeUsed> Never have i been in any situation like that with family
<WontBeUsed> NO...
<Swaffy> Apparently.
<Swaffy> She was bleeding a lot last week.
<WontBeUsed> do you think it was a miscarriage?
<Swaffy> Then found out that she had a miscarriage. I think God said to her, "Oh, no. It's not your time yet."
<WontBeUsed> yeah pregnacy makes people vonarable
<Swaffy> Heheh.
<WontBeUsed> how many mounts was she in?
<Swaffy> My mother was scared, though. She told me that my sister could have serious pregnancy issues the first three weeks of pregnancy. So I am somewhat glad it was a miscarriage.
<Swaffy> Mounts?
<WontBeUsed> im guessing around 3-5
<WontBeUsed> yeah
<Swaffy> What do you mean?
<WontBeUsed> how many mounts was your sister pregnet?
<Swaffy> Not sure. All I know is that she got prego and lost the baby.
<WontBeUsed> dang that sucks...
<Swaffy> She's fine now. She's working as a baby-sitter and going to college to later become a math teacher.
<WontBeUsed> oh
<Swaffy> Yeah.
<WontBeUsed> Math Teacher :(
<WontBeUsed> i dislike mather teachers....
<WontBeUsed> lol
<Swaffy> On a side note, I plan on buying myself a Springfield Armory M14 or M1A rifle when I move out. But I've been planning on that before the whole deal with my sister.
<WontBeUsed> i want a shotgun
<WontBeUsed> any shotgun will do
<Swaffy> Why not a rifle? they pack more of a punch.
<WontBeUsed> i like to get close and personal and on top of that its better for a house
<Swaffy> True.
<WontBeUsed> dude i got to get some sleep i got school tomarrow
<Swaffy> Remington makes reliable 12-guages.
<WontBeUsed> (school sucks)
<WontBeUsed> Remington is a GOOD gun brand
<Swaffy> You need to get some sleep. Thanks for sharing your story. I'm glad to hear that you are fine now.
<Swaffy> I need sleep too.
<Swaffy> I have nothing to do tomorrow.
<Swaffy> : )
<WontBeUsed> alright then man, and thank you for letting me in on your life
<Swaffy> It's what I do, brother.
<WontBeUsed> oh btw i get in this chat room often,
<WontBeUsed> NOT always but i do from time to time
<Swaffy> I have not been here in a few weeks. Something was telling me to get on.
<Swaffy> Or someone.
<Swaffy> Anyway, good night.
<WontBeUsed> yeah maybe

*Nick runs
<Kipikipo> You're supposed to kill someone while hiding in a haystack
*Kyu points out that's because volcanic ash is maintained at a much higher temperature and exposed to heat longer than regular ash, making it more dangerous
<Kipikipo> But to do that you're supposed to wait in one spot till your target comes
<Kipikipo> and hope someone hunting you doesn't come first.
<Ray> 02wb Angel
<Nick> Isn't that what you're able to produce?
<Kipikipo> And even if your target comes, they have to be right next to the haystack

<Umbreon> 12or whatever
*Curly has knowledge about inspircd >.>
<steff12321> curly,
<steff12321> i have a question
<Curly> yes?
<steff12321> i am running mIRC on my server running windows 7
<steff12321> and i have xBOT on it
<steff12321> as a script
<steff12321> ok?
<Curly> you might want to talk to Ari about server issues
<steff12321> it keeps saying: ping timeout
<steff12321> its not the server
<Curly> ping timeout means the internet's disconnected
<steff12321> yeah
<steff12321> but its not
<Umbreon> 12http://notalwaysright.com/an-open-and-shut-case-2/8891

<JetTheLatios> !ew ipods

<steff12321> the internet is fine
<JetTheLatios> :]
<Umbreon> http://notalwaysright.com/an-open-and-shut-case-2/8891
<Curly> it's just your bot that d/cs like that?
<steff12321> ChainSaw?
<steff12321> wait
<steff12321> what do you mean?
<steff12321> i dont know much about this
<Curly> um, what's timing out?
<steff12321> the bot
<Curly> d/c means disconnect
<steff12321> then yeah
<steff12321> and its on the same connection
<Curly> I don't suppose your timeout duration is shorter than normal is it?
<steff12321> nope
<steff12321> 120 s
<steff12321> it went once to 121
<steff12321> you wanna take a look?
<Curly> I'm not sure if I can think of anything that could cause that issue ._.;
<Curly> other than like
<Curly> an unstable router
<Curly> are you hosting the bot on the same computer?
<steff12321> linksys E3000 running latest version of DD-WRT
<steff12321> no
<steff12321> different computer
<Curly> is that computer on a wireless connection or something?
<steff12321> yes
<Curly> is yours?
<steff12321> yes
<steff12321> mine is on 5GhZ
<Curly> well, I can only guess it's the wireless adapter on your bot's computer that's doing it
<steff12321> and the other is on 2.4
<steff12321> hmm
<steff12321> do you have team?
<steff12321> teamviewer*
<Curly> no
<steff12321> would you download it for me?
<steff12321> (:
<Curly> I don't think I could help you beyond basic stuff anyway
<Curly> for networking I mean
<steff12321> i have an idea
*Umbreon swims with EccoCode
<NF|Lightning> hmmmm hey vulcan
<steff12321> its only when there is nothing going on in the channel when the bot ping timeouts
<steff12321> so
<steff12321> what i was thinking
<steff12321> is that
<Chimera> mew
<Vulcan> 14*pounces and clings to*
*EccoCode swims with Umbreon
<steff12321> maybe i can install another bot on that comp
<Umbreon> 12^^
<steff12321> and get the two constantly pinging each other
<Umbreon> 12guess ecco doesn't have much choice
*NF|Lightning >.<!
<EccoCode> not really, xP
<steff12321> but i need a script?
<steff12321> otherwise
<GreatLugia> This is going to take a little more time then I thought :/
<steff12321> i could maybe change the ping interval?
<GreatLugia> I will pm you the site in the forums after I find you a good site for codes
<Curly> that's odd, your computer should be, as far as I know, constantly sending packets
<Curly> regardless of your bot
*NF|Lightning .... its good to see you too.....
<steff12321> my computer is fine
<Curly> I think you'd have to ask Ari or something though
<steff12321> doesnt disconnect ata ll
<steff12321> at all
<JetTheLatios> Alright Lugia
<Curly> not your computer, the bot's computer
*Vulcan 14smiles and cuddles. "Heya."
<JetTheLatios> Thanks :]
*steff12321 pokes laptoparisteo
<steff12321> yeah
<steff12321> the bots computer
<steff12321> doesnt diconnect from the WAN
<GreatLugia> Well I have to leave for now so seeya ^^
<steff12321> aka the router
<Curly> that really is odd. it could be an issue with your ports
*NF|Lightning *squirms to get free* whats up
<steff12321> what ones should be forwarded for this?
<steff12321> i have
*Vulcan 14releases and smiles. "Nothing much, you?"

<Curly> oh right
<Curly> um
<Curly> oh nevermind
*Curly keeps looking it up
<Ray> 02FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF ANGEL STARR!!!!!!!
<Curly> um, I have no idea which ports that would be ._.
*NF|Lightning not much ..... except that ixr seems to have got lost for some reason lol ...... she has a dark form now......
<Ray> 02That witness never gives up >_<
<Curly> it could be anything from 6660 to 6669 I think
<Curly> but I'm not sure if that's only servers or the actual client too
<Curly> you could look it up on command prompt
<Vulcan> 14Oh god. x.=.x
<steff12321> oh
<steff12321> how do i do that?
<steff12321> e.e
<steff12321> im connecting through 6667
*NF|Lightning ....... I was forced to since... dark absorbed several dark crystals and came to kill us........
<Curly> fyi, this is a bit above my head, one moment
*steff12321 forwarded 6667
<SheenaFox> o3o
<drfsupercenter> 03EW THAT FACE
<SheenaFox> o3o
<Curly> I don't think it's actually the default server ports that you need to forward, I'm still looking it up >.>
<steff12321> oh
*Cat lies down on the floor
<Curly> um.... I'm not sure which port it is ._.
*Curly just tried looking into her router's configs but there was nothing special there
<NF|Lightning> speaking of dark...... where is he
<Curly> you should give Ari a poke later, he's sick right now though
<Umbreon> 12drfsupercenter i never heard if you played any of those games lol

<TR_Reed> Rune Factory Oceans
<Kosovo> ^
<Kosovo> I've heard of that game.
<TR_Reed> you should
<TR_Reed> Rune Factory Oceans
<Kosovo> It's on both the PS3 and Wii in Japan I believe
<TR_Reed> yes
<The_Luginator> Heard, but never wondered
<TR_Reed> I wondered
<TR_Reed> because I'm a Harvest Moon/Rune Factory fanboy
<darkshadow> ....
<TR_Reed> I tend to like series that have their share of faults
<Kosovo> So I'm assuming you've played Rune Factory Frontier on the Wii, then? XD
<Kosovo> Because I actually plan on picking up that game soon
<TR_Reed> no
<SheenaFox> !Umbreon
*Umbreon now belongs to SheenaFox for 9 minutes
<TR_Reed> sadly not
<Kosovo> ah.
<TR_Reed> I don't have any Rune Factory games,yet
<TR_Reed> which is strange, me being a fanboy of it and all
<Kosovo> lol
<Kosovo> I've played Rune Factory 2 on the DS
<Kosovo> it's a pretty decent rpg
<TR_Reed> but I hope to get 3, Frontier, and Oceans soon
<TR_Reed> cool
<TR_Reed> I'll have to get it as well
<Kosovo> I plan on getting super mario all stars this sunday
<TR_Reed> I have the original on my snes
<Kosovo> although apparently no one knows that it's coming out besides me, judging from the reactions of people I tell that to. XD
<TR_Reed> I knew it was coming out
<TR_Reed> That was one of the first games I ever played.....

<Kyu> 07didn't you use regular paper last year? |D
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes
<drfsupercenter> 03but last year I used quarter-fold cards
<drfsupercenter> 03this year they're half fold
<drfsupercenter> 03mainly I did that because I needed envelopes, regardless what size
<drfsupercenter> 03and I was like, if I'm gonna use fancy paper, I'm making bigger cards XD
<Kyu> 07lol
<drfsupercenter> 03gives me more room to write
<drfsupercenter> 03also hm
<drfsupercenter> 03I wonder if my laser printer can print card

<eXAKR> OK
<eXAKR> Back to tidying the room for me
<drfsupercenter> 03actually they could if I told them to. that's not the point
*drfsupercenter runs
<drfsupercenter> 03wow you can tell I'm tired, I accidentally wrote on this card upside down x.x;.
<eXAKR> what
<eXAKR> anyway bbl
<drfsupercenter> 03as in, I wrote on the wrong part of it so when you open the card it looks upside down
<drfsupercenter> 03I fixed it, I just had to waste more cardstock reprinting it
<drfsupercenter> 03After this card I'll have all the non-US people's cards done, and I'll go put them in the mailbox before going to bed, so they'll go out sooner. I work on the US people's later this week

<St_Nick> it's doing my nut in on this ev training lark
<St_Nick> Anyway I watched a clip of best wishes too, well, abridged series rather
<Aurora> 6well
<Steve> 12 Hello, LaptopAristeo and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<St_Nick> That dudes first ever pokemon Tsutarja/Snivy beat Ash's pikachu...
<St_Nick> DOES
<St_Nick> NOT
<St_Nick> COMPUTE!!!
<Chimera> 04aww fff
<Aurora> 6getting up that many points involves held items, nature, characteristic, base stats, and level
<St_Nick> It's like my starter totodile beating lances dragonitr XD
<LaptopAristeo> rawr
<St_Nick> Hmm ok
<St_Nick> I'm thinking of getting the speed raising brace with my BP
<St_Nick> but I only have 16 BP
<St_Nick> Wb
<Angel_Espeon> 13brought my food with me :P
<Raine> hiya Ari
<Raine> here ya go!
<Angel_Espeon> 13For EV training, I just use a macho brace and pokerus
*St_Nick needs to find out what natures his team are
<Angel_Espeon> 13because I happen to have a lot of Pokemon with pokerus on my games xD
<LaptopAristeo> :o
<LaptopAristeo> ^^
<St_Nick> I can't get my pokemon to get damn pokerus ><
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well
<Angel_Espeon> 13I have a baby Pokemon giveaway thread on TST
<St_Nick> I do have a macho brace tho
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I'm offering to give anyone pokerus with each trade as well :P
*LaptopAristeo hugs Raine
*Raine hugs
<St_Nick> Does your pokemon have to have pokerus tho? In order to ev train?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nah, pokerus is just an added bonus that makes EV training go by a lot faster
<St_Nick> Hmm ok
<Angel_Espeon> 13I know what you mean about not understanding Pokerus, it took me forever to teach myself about it by looking online xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13it's easier to understand when you have someone explain it to you, as a few of my friends have told me
<Angel_Espeon> 13wait
<Angel_Espeon> 13I mean
<Angel_Espeon> 13EV training
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13but yeah
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm generally bad at explaining stuff, but I can at least try :B
<St_Nick> I thought what you had to do was level up against a pokemon with the stat you want
<Angel_Espeon> 13well, that's basically it :P
<Espeon> Pokerus is an STD that's beneficial to you.
<Espeon> Creepy I know
<St_Nick> So I fitted Lucario with Macho brace and levelled up just fighting golbat at mt silver
*Espeon flops
<Angel_Espeon> 13every Pokemon gives a certain number of EV points in what would be considered that Pokemon's best stat
<St_Nick> But when I levelled up I got only two ev points :/
<Angel_Espeon> 13You can have a max of 510 total EV points on a Pokemon altogether, and a total of 255 in one stat
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've noticed it starts off slow, but you make more progress the more you keep it up
<St_Nick> I know all that but I just don't seem to be doing it right
<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh, you also need to know if your Pokemon isn't already maxed out in EV points
<St_Nick> Hmm my Lucario is 170 something in speed
<St_Nick> So I doubt it's mazes
<St_Nick> Maxed
<Angel_Espeon> 13If you go to the person who gives out effort ribbons to Pokemon, you can find out if your Pokemon is maxed on EV points or not
<Angel_Espeon> 13if they give you an effort ribbon, you're maxed out
<Angel_Espeon> 13if they don't, you still have EV points to spare :P
<St_Nick> Where are they?
<Angel_Espeon> 13What game are you playing?
<St_Nick> In SS?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Blackthorn City
<St_Nick> K
<Angel_Espeon> 13house to the right of the pokemon centre
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also it's normally best to EV train a Pokemon as soon as you first get, since all Pokemon start off with 0 EVs
<Angel_Espeon> 13if you've been training up your Pokemon randomly in the past then you've probably picked up EVs that have been spread randomly throughout all of the Pokemon's stats
<St_Nick> Yeah
<St_Nick> I got a few lvl 80 ones now:/
<St_Nick> So I wanna try ev training them now
<Angel_Espeon> 13Have you checked with the woman in Blackthorn City if your Pokemon are already maxed out or not
<Angel_Espeon> 13Because if they are, you might want to get some EV-reducing berries to take off points in certain stats
<St_Nick> Anyway gonna go watch tv now
<St_Nick> Thanks for help angel
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD Have fun
<St_Nick> Ty bye all
<Aurora> 6ok bbl
<legend_knight_234> hey lighting

<NF|Lightning> no i'm not mad why would you think that? i'm just multitasking while online
<legend_knight_234> oh
<legend_knight_234> well because you didn't answer me the first time i was worried that you wouldn't talk to mt until i said sorry
<Angel_Espeon> 13...In all honesty, I wasn't finished explaining |D and something tells me he didn't get the fact that if his Pokemon are already maxed out then there's no point EV training them
<Espeon> It's always confusing beyond belief the first time you hear about EV's
<Espeon> :3
<NF|Lightning> thats normal for me unless there are a lot of people in here
<legend_knight_234> have you wondered what i've been doing all the time i've been gone
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's one of those subjects that make you go "wat" at first
<NF|Lightning> ehhh no
<Angel_Espeon> 13then one day it suddenly makes sense
<legend_knight_234> just wait before you say something i gotta put on some music
<Angel_Espeon> 13and then you're like "OMG I UNDERSTAND NOW"
<Angel_Espeon> 13etc

<Angel_Espeon> 13now it's "it seems"
<NF|Lightning> yeah big fan of sonic i'd even say my favorite video game character

<Scorchentine> wow...there are actually others here!
<legend_knight_234> because there's this one level that i can't get past because the floor breaks underneth me but if i jump i get by spikes
<Scorchentine> what game?
<NF|Lightning> super metroid

<legend_knight_234> not unless you get boost ball in super
<legend_knight_234> no the level where you have to run be fore fall through the floor but if jump there's spikes
<Scorchentine> hmm....don't remember...sorry. ^^;

<Stormy> I seriously can't wait for the new semester though
<Stormy> no more putting up with my annoying liberal honors teacher

<Paranoia> Lol
<Paranoia> that must be fun
<Stormy> Very
<Stormy> He's also obsessed with bees
*Skylands fluffs Espeon
<Paranoia> Is it the same one that said that Disney was evil or something?
<Paranoia> ...bees?
<Stormy> No, that was last year. XD
<Paranoia> ...freaking liberals
<Paranoia> :P
*Umbreon fluffs Skylands
<Stormy> That teacher was OK though; he didn't try to preach politics during class like this one does
<Stormy> lol, yeah
<Paranoia> probably have job security so he can say whatever the heck he wants
<Stormy> this guy is a bee keeper and manages to bring bees into almost every discussion we have
<Paranoia> *has
<Stormy> Yeah >_>
<Paranoia> That's really random
<Stormy> I made sure to give him a bad evaluation though, haha
<Paranoia> Very nice.
<Skylands> 10Fluff chain
<Stormy> "Brings irrelevant political opinions into the conversations." "Doesn't keep students on topic." "Brings students off topic."
<Umbreon> 12yes
<Umbreon> 12..Ecco is dinner now?
<Umbreon> 12but i don't want to eat dolphin D:
<Paranoia> If you had any friends in that class you couldve got them to write similar things too
<Stormy> they did
<Paranoia> yes
<Stormy> We complain about him all the time actually
<Paranoia> put him in his place! XD
<Stormy> I actually did once! :D
<Kipi> owo D-ray
<Paranoia> How so?
*Kipi pets
<Stormy> He was trying to argue with the class that humans are no different than animals and that everything humans do is based on survival instincts
<Paranoia> wut
<Stormy> Despite the fact that that had /nothing/ to do with the text we were reading
<Stormy> Yeah, apparently we have friends because it helps us survive.
<Paranoia> because checking facebook is definitely a survival instinct
<Stormy> So he kept interrupting everything we said and talking about bees
*Espeon stacks Umbreons
*Espeon latefluffs someone too it seems.
<Stormy> Like "bees do this, therefore humans do this"
<Paranoia> o.O
<Stormy> So finally I just told him, "I think we would be able to make our points a lot better if you would stop interrupting us."
<Stormy> ...and he actually stopped
<Paranoia> I think he's probably over simplifying things just a little bit
<Stormy> :D
<Paranoia> Haha nice
<Stormy> Someone in the class brought up online relationships
<Stormy> Their existance proves that humans don't solely choose their friendships based on pheremones like bees do
<Stormy> But he completely ignores that point and starts talking about bees again
<Paranoia> *facepalm*
<Stormy> Despite the fact that we kept bringing it up over and over
*Umbreon floofs Espeon
<Paranoia> sounds like a typical internet argument to me
<Stormy> Exactly!
*Espeon falls in love?
*Espeon is confused.
<Paranoia> well at least thee whole calss isnt agreeing with everyting he says
<Stormy> Yeah, but some people were
<Paranoia> *the class
<Stormy> one girl brought up the stupidest argument I've ever heard in my life
<Scorchentine> good.
<Stormy> She said he's right, and friends are needed for survival because we'd commit suicide without them
*Skylands used Confusion on Espeon?
<Paranoia> O_o
<Stormy> -___-
<Umbreon> lol
*Michel offers a fish then
<Michel> better then dolphin
<Paranoia> somehow if bees didnt live togther I don't think they would commit suicide
<Paranoia> it doesnt really correlate
<Stormy> Yeah, exactly
<Stormy> animals don't commit suicide
<Stormy> So that point makes no sense

<Paranoia> the teacher's?
<Stormy> People were whining right before break that they didn't want to have a class on thursday, so he assigned us to comment on that
<Stormy> Yeah
<Umbreon> 12i'd have to dig it p
<Umbreon> 12up
<Umbreon> 12it was a little rushed
<Umbreon> 12so i didn't bother sharing it XD
<Stormy> And of course, he accuses us of "knee-jerk responses" and asks /us/ to come up with an answer for the question he couldn't answer himself
<Paranoia> "o my surprise, I've discovered a book that has implications beyond baseball, and is applicable to all areas of life, including beekeeping." I Lol'd
<Stormy> Hahaha
<Paranoia> Wow
<Stormy> I haven't read any of the latest entries

<Paranoia> o.O
<Stormy> *three
<Paranoia> for the thrid time
<Stormy> yeah, he's weird
<Umbreon> 12must leave. bye
<Paranoia> I'll say
<Stormy> If you end up going here and taking honors (which you should, otherwise you'll have to take a speech class and tons of other gen eds), avoid Wes Miller at all costs
<Stormy> :P
<Espeon> From you two, obviously.
<GreatLugia> bye umbreon ^^
<Paranoia> okay, I'll keep that in mind
<Espeon> Bye Umbreon
<Paranoia> I got something about honors inthe mail the other day
<Paranoia> what exactly is that class about anyway?
<Stormy> It's basically a class that you take instead of their normal Lasallian Core Traditions
<Stormy> You read books that the teacher assigns and talk about them during class
<Skylands> Floofbutt
<Kipi> !define godes
<[TST]Bot> -!- Gode (ጎዴ; Godey) is a city in the Ethiopian part of the Ogaden. Located in the Gode Zone of the Somali Region, the city has a latitude and longitude of . ...
<Stormy> every so often you'll have to write short interpretive papers about what you read
<GreatLugia> Has anyone seen my new deviation?
<GreatLugia> http://greatlugia.deviantart.com/art/Reshiram-188875697?q=&qo=
<Paranoia> hm, but Mr. Beekeeper gets to choose all the books?
<Stormy> It's great because it covers a lot of useless classes you'd have to take if you were in LCT
<Skylands> 10Love the background
<Stormy> Yeah, but only if you have him for first semester sop[censored]re year
<Paranoia> "sop[censored]re"
<Paranoia> Hah
<Paranoia> that system does sound good though
<Skylands> 10(as usual)
<GreatLugia> Thanks, I made sure to give it more of a B&W look
<Stormy> 12He and the other first semester sopho12more teacher get to choose the books for that semester
<Espeon> It's the same thing
<Skylands|Away> Yus
<Skylands|Away> and bai
<Stormy> You'll have a different teacher every semester, and there will be two to choose from
<Stormy> Lol, filter
<Stormy> I forgot about that thing
<Stormy> It doesn't censor muffins anymore though :(
<Paranoia> but but...the censoredins...
<Paranoia> :(
<Stormy> I know... D:
<Paranoia> cucesoredbers?
<Stormy> cucumber
<Paranoia> nope
<Stormy> Aww
<Aurora> 6oh that was yours?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol wut
<Paranoia> why can't you say "[censored]" though?
<Aurora> 6saw it show up in the club, awaiting approval
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm halfway through the second Best Wishes episode
<Angel_Espeon> 13Has Ash seriously forgotten how to catch Pokemon? =w=
<Aurora> 6the name looked familiar I wondered if it was you
<Aurora> 6of course he has
<Stormy> what was the "censored"
<GreatLugia> Yes, I worked all day on it, lol
<Aurora> 6he loses his memory each season
<Paranoia> in sop[censored]re
<Stormy> because it says ho2mo
<Stormy> =/
<Paranoia> I know, just wondering why you cant say it
<Stormy> I guess because people use it as an insult
<Stormy> Oh, I figured out that epic-chat has the exact same filter as spyroforum
<Stormy> XD
<Stormy> the SF filter has the most random words ever and they're all censored here too
<Paranoia> do you still go to SF?
<Stormy> Heck no
<Paranoia> ok
<Paranoia> just wondering...
<Stormy> I had an email from bmah from a long time ago from when he was complaining about the filter
<Stormy> I actually go to darkspyro now. lol
<Paranoia> really?
<Stormy> Yeah
<Paranoia> I wouldnt stoop that low...
<Paranoia> :P
<Stormy> there are some really immature people there, but it's OK for the most part
<Stormy> There's this guy there who pretty much attacks anyone who says they have a religion
<GreatLugia> Reshiram is a very time consuming pokemon to draw, lol
<Stormy> it's ridiculous
<Paranoia> wow
<Paranoia> do yuo ever post there?
<Stormy> it's like, yeah, I get that you're an atheist, but why do I have to explain my religion to you when you've already made up your mind about it again?
<Stormy> I post sometimes
<Espeon> If Ash was in the game world he would be reminded how to catch Pokemon once a month by some random old man anyway.
<Espeon> whoo
<Stormy> I started going there when I heard about the new Spyro game that's supposed to be coming out in 2011
<Stormy> Have you heard about it?
<Paranoia> o.o
<Paranoia> no
<Paranoia> is it LoS or what?
<GreatLugia> There’s so many fine
<Stormy> We don't know yet
<GreatLugia> details on it that you have to be
<GreatLugia> careful not to miss
<Stormy> Activision hasn't actually announced anything
<Stormy> But someone found some leaked information
<Paranoia> just speculation mostly?
<Stormy> And apparently the working title is "Spyro's Kingdom"
<Stormy> And it's supposed to be on just DS and Wii
<Paranoia> huh
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol wow, Team Rocket are actually awesome for a change
<Stormy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_HIWdicVSQ
<Paranoia> Spyro's supposed to be a Playstation exclusive
<Aurora> 6yeaaaaah-
<Aurora> 6not for long
<Paranoia> or it was 10 years ago
<Stormy> It hasn't been ETD
<Paranoia> XD
<Stormy> :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13...oh dear |D
*Kipi sits on Angel_Espeon
<Stormy> That was only because insomniac only developed for playstation, I think
*Espeon sits on Kipi
<GreatLugia> Getting the colors right was hard to, because Reshiram isn’t solid white
<Stormy> People are speculating that they might keep it in the LoS universe, take off the "dark and edgy" stuff, and make it more lighthearted and fun
<Paranoia> That wouldnt be so bad
<Paranoia> maybe
<Stormy> Since Nintendo is more well-known for family games
<Paranoia> but the working title is kind of lame
<Stormy> I agree
<GreatLugia> As some people think, same thing with Lugia
<Paranoia> I'm very disappointed by darkspyro's poll
<Stormy> remember when we were first hearing about ANB?
<Stormy> the working title was "Spyro: Legend"
<Stormy> XD
<Paranoia> Hah, yeah
<Stormy> Is it still the music poll?
<Paranoia> yep
<Stormy> I can't believe people voted for DotD over StD
<Stormy> =/
<Paranoia> in know right?
<Paranoia> I just dowloaded some Spyro songs the other day actually
<Angel_Espeon> 13Omg Mijumaru is so cute in the anime
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's been a while since I last enjoyed myself watching Pokemon |D
<Paranoia> Misty bog, dry canyon, toasty
<Paranoia> EPIC
<Paranoia> :P
<Stormy> You downloaded them?
<Stormy> where?
<Stormy> o.o
<Paranoia> that one kh something or other site
<Stormy> oh khinsider
<Paranoia> I could find it if you want
<Espeon> Enjoy it while it lasts
<Stormy> I used to have them from there, but then I deleted them all after I found out they were supposedly illegal
<GreatLugia> I really find myself enjoying watching it. Even though it’s in Japanese XD
<Paranoia> :/
<Stormy> But it's not like they were released anywhere else
<Stormy> Or anyone's making a profit off them
<Stormy> =/
<Paranoia> somehow I doubt that Stewart Copeland woukld care 11 years later
<Paranoia> exactly
<Stormy> Probably not
<GreatLugia> Can’t wait for the shows to be in English
<Stormy> Now I won't get them because I'm too paranoid about viruses from that site. >.>
<Paranoia> it gave you viruses before?
<Stormy> No, but you never know
<Stormy> :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13Shows are nearly always better in Japanese anyway :B
<Stormy> I have no idea where all those viruses came from
<Paranoia> you could use your old laptop, and then tranfer the files
<Paranoia> or would that not do anything?
<Stormy> I don't know
<Stormy> but my old laptop won't even power on now. XD
<Paranoia> that poor thing
<Paranoia> abused
<Paranoia> :P
<Stormy> the battery died from sitting in the computer without being used for so long
<Espeon> Not if someone for some reason don't want to listen to something they don't understand for some reason, having to rely on subs. I've heard of many people like that lol
<Stormy> That happened when dad took it away
<Stormy> So now I'll have to buy another new battery and another new AC adapter.
<Stormy> -_-
<Paranoia> I wouldn't wate the money if I had your nice laptop
<Paranoia> *waste
<Stormy> it was good for taking to classes though
<Stormy> and I could leave it on all the time
<Stormy> Do you have a laptop yet? You're going to want one for college
<Paranoia> not yet
<Paranoia> I'm hoping to get one for Christmas
<Paranoia> (right)
<Stormy> Well, you're not me
<Stormy> So for you, it might be possible
<Stormy> :P
<Paranoia> I can only hope
<Stormy> Dad is getting Mom a new one for Christmas
<Stormy> So you could have her old one!
<Paranoia> ....yay?
<Stormy> ...with the metal bolt holding the screen together...!
<Paranoia> yeah.......\
<Paranoia> too many periods..
<Scorchentine> .....seriously, i think I hear crickets! xD
<Paranoia> I'll wait as long as possible before buying myself one
<Paranoia> just in case
*NF|Lightning crickets chirp
<Stormy> Well if you don't get one, I'll buy the AC adapter and battery for mine and give you that one for $150
<Paranoia> really?
<Stormy> Sure
<Paranoia> Yay
<Paranoia> thanks
<Stormy> No problem
<Stormy> I bought it for about $350, so ...
<Stormy> computers lose a lot of their value after they've been used for a while
<Paranoia> how much do new ones sell for
<Scorchentine> lol
<Stormy> Anywhere from the price I got my old one for to like, $3000
<Stormy> but those are Apple
<Stormy> the really expensive ones
<Paranoia> I know if I get a cheap one, I won't be able to fix all the problems very well
<Paranoia> but I'd rather not pay 1000 bucks
<Stormy> There shouldn't really be problems with the cheap ones
<Stormy> they just won't be as fast
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aurora03)02WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
<Stormy> And the screen might be tiny or the graphics might not be as good

<steff12321> pretty much
<steff12321> We focus on the people on the network — everything else is secondary.
<steff12321> This comes from Google's statement of principles and is perhaps the most important guiding principle that we have. With every strategic change we make on Epic Chat, we have to ask ourselves if this is in the best interest of the core community and of the people of the network as a whole.

<steff12321> -ChanServ- No such ban *!Mibbit@57F775.DE079D.0547A9.FCF8DB on #torrent-invites.
<steff12321> ??
<Aristeo> Right... you banned *!Mibbit@* .... "unbanning" isn't what you think it is -- to unban something, you're just removing the host you set before
<Corevette789> Exceptions...how do you do exceptions
<Icydragon> Oh my god...
<Icydragon> *dies*
<steff12321> yes, i want an exception
<Cynder7> 6What? D:
<steff12321> maybe like a +I HOSTMASK?
<Aristeo> Unfortunately, you can't do exceptions through ChanServ -- gotta do it the good ol' fashion way:
<Icydragon> You poked my brain
<Aristeo> /mode #channel +e host
<steff12321> what is +e?
<Corevette789> lol
<Corevette789> Really?

<Corevette789> +*
<steff12321> and it works?
<steff12321> one sec
<Corevette789> It should
<Aristeo> Just be careful with exceptions
<Aristeo> Don't wanna make them too liberal
<Cynder7> 6I poked your arm.. D:
<Corevette789> Aristeo dosen't have the fantasy command set up
<Icydragon> That's where my brain is! D:
<steff12321> lol
<Aristeo> There's no fantasy command set up for exceptions, I'm afraid ;_;
<Cynder7> 6Why? D:
