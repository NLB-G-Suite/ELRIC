<Pinkie_Pie> Chicks dig you Rainbow_Dash
<NightShade> she needs a ban hammer!

<Apprentice1994> not really cheap this time...
<Painguin> well, i mean they all do but Twilights seem bigger
<chedduhr> more cheap
<HaysforPonies> Rainbow Dash is boss
<quill> chicks dig RD
<Hipster_Brony> 8apparently using your natural physical talents is cheating now
<Flutteryay> Sounds like the intro riff to Shredded Humans by Cannibal Corpse

<Rainbow_Dash> That wasn't cheating at all.
<shadowLurker> wing power!
<CAJ> Hipster_Brony: AJ, as the element of Honesty, trusts Dash enough to not use her wings as an advantage. it has nothing to do with being atheletic.
<ValtheJean> this is the same town that thinks Trixie actually beat her competitors, I think that there was no easy way to determine this contest :P
<chedduhr> man those background ponies must have really boring lives
<HaysforPonies> Sour apples are good.

<Nittany_Tiger_> And they all hate you Fluttershy.
<ThunderDash> YOU'RE... GOING TO LOOVVEE MEEEEE!!!
<ForTheBronies> 0Wait...Greenjays?
<Nomikos> buzzards, someone didn't do the research
<HaysforPonies> So bold
<DuskShine> SPY!
<Dr_Klaus> flamingoes aren't always pink
<Denied_Existence> 3Fluttershy and Dash have the best reasons in my opinion...and MAAAABBBYYYEEE pinkie
<ninjapwny> assassins creed
<BronyWithNoName> You do the pony pokey and you give a little shout....BISON!
<LonelyAstronaut> Assassins Creed
<HaysforPonies> Yes it matters
<interior_gummy> Rezo: make angel, gummy, opal, winona, and owlowicious all buddies
<NightShade> that rainbow is a spy!
<ThunderDash> > anybody
<TGMM> PCissuperiortoMac why thank you
<Riders> Why does Angel look so emotionless
<Apprentice1994> fluttershy probably wouldn't even put out...
<HaysforPonies> FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT
<BronyNas> 4 shoes
<SpringFire> duskshine...oh that's where I've read that name! Just finished reading that fic
<Mac> want tickets, insult keeper of them
<ninjapwny> RD's gotta do the leap of faith
<DuskShine> Fic?
<Dr_Klaus> WHAT
<ninjapwny> oatmeal
<HaysforPonies> Poor Twilight
<Denied_Existence> 3NEED A DISPENSER HERE!
<dispatchrabbi> Quick! Teleport!
<Rezo> interior_gummy: I've long argued for an AngelXOpalescence ship
<Flutteryay> Applejack and Fluttershy had the best reasons
<Dr_Klaus> Angry fluttershy?
<ThunderDash> > Fluttershy angry
<cirek> boxes
<HaysforPonies> lol Brady Bunch
<Dr_Klaus> NO WAY
<interior_gummy> fluttershy seems like the one with a secret bdsm fetish
<TGMM> IB4 OATMEAL, ARE YOU CRAZY?
<BronyWithNoName> OATMEAL YOU SO CRAZY
<ThunderDash> ABANDON THREAD
<ninjapwny> inb4 oatmeal
<Apprentice1994> ahem, oatmeal
<TwilightSparkle> QUIET!!!!
<SpringFire> isn't that a character in a fan fic?
<Rainbow_Dash> Ninjapwny, it's not much of a leap of faith. Wings remember?
<MoonstoneCharm> angry fluttershy?
<dispatchrabbi> ARE YOU CRAZY
<Hipster_Brony> 8OATMEAL!
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> Derpy thinger.
<CAJ> FLuttershy has teh worst reason.
<decapman> oh pinkie pie you are so random
<HaysforPonies> Awww that whine was adorable
<Ghosties> 4Applejack deserves the ticket. She was there when Twilight got the tickets from Celestia, and she has the only non personal reason for going (wants to make money for her family)
<Aponymous> We need a Gumbow Dash fic. >_>
<TwilightSparkle> go on shoo
<interior_gummy> fluttershy can just go to the zoo
<ham993> Fluttershy has the least selfish reason.
<NightShade> rarity needs a tophat and a monocle
<ForTheBronies> 0 201 to 151! UNACCEPTABLE!
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> Im eating the carrots atm.
<Rezo> Applejack has the worst reason. You're invited to a gala, and you go there to SELL APPLES? Seriously... Nio
<BronyWithNoName> GummyDash shipping
<CAJ> Ghosties: THANK YOU. Seriously.
<Apprentice1994> Ghosties, Applejack is worst pony
<Nomikos> what makes an unselfish reason better than a selfish reason?
<dispatchrabbi> Twilight should just pick whoever she thinks she'll have the most fun with.
<HaysforPonies> Love me love me not
<Whizz_Bang> isnt money normally a selfish pursuit?
<Ghosties> 4Fluttershy only wants to go for herself
<TwilightSparkle> who should go with me?
<interior_gummy> gummytwist is best ship
<Ghosties> 4Pinkie wants to go for herself
<bulletbarrage> desperate noms
<Woahbrony> NOM
<CAJ> Apprentice1994: how about I slap your shit?
<Ghosties> 4RD wants to go for herself
<ForTheBronies> 0THE NUMBER'S DROPPING! RUN TO DA CHOPPA
<Painguin> really good reasons
<BronyNas> rarity has the worst reason
<Dr_Klaus> That was atimmy moment
<Elky> ham: have you seen best night ever? she's arguably the most selfish of all.
<CriticKitten> Ghosties: Agreed, even though Pinkie's my fav, she's definitely the most selfish. :p
<Bajar> Rarity wants to get laid
<DSNesmith> I read that gummy x twist fic
<Ghosties> 4Rarity wants to go for herself
<ninjapwny> she should just got by herself
<DSNesmith> it was serious lulz
<Apprentice1994> CAJ, that sounds disgusting
<bendelsohn> fluttershy is best pony
<Dr_Klaus> EXTRA CRISPY
<Ghosties> 4AJ wants to go for her family
<ninjapwny> she and spike
<HaysforPonies> I wonder how hayfries taste
<decapman> spike is best, he doesnt want to go
<Mac> twlight was going to invite applejack first, danced with applejack when she got them.
<LonelyAstronaut> and the money :P
<DSNesmith> yeah, AJ has the best reason
<Apprentice1994> CAJ, also ineffective...
<CAJ> Ghosties is officially the best mod.
<Rainbow_Dash> You should give me the ticket!
<DSNesmith> RBD has the second best, because she wants to go to start her career
<interior_gummy> pinkie isn't selfish, she throws parties and bakes for everyone
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> ... I love how gems are so common in this world and come precut.
<Darf14> Sad Pinkie is Sad
<TGMM> http://images.wikia.com/mlp/images/4/49/Horte_Cuisine.png

<Rainbow_Dash> Come on TwilightSparkle!
<NightShade> they gonna be mad bro
<TGMM> FEKKIN' SAVED
<ham993> AJ has good intentions, but it's horribly thought out.
<Whizz_Bang> eat
<Barry> Out of all of them, AJ has the best reason, because she's going for the whole farm
<Dr_Klaus> Look, she was planning on fluttershy and applejack
<Mac> ghosties is the best mod
<TwilightSparkle> Im sure every thing will be better once I eat grrrrrrr
<BronyWithNoName> In ze rain?
<DuskShine> We need more Raridash.
<DSNesmith> SUDDENLY IRENE
<Whizz_Bang> eat it now
<MoonstoneCharm> grats dash
<TwilightSparkle> What are you doing
<LonelyAstronaut> OH STOP GROVELING
<dispatchrabbi> Nice reversal of the usual comic thundercloud over someone's head.
<Elky> actually, dari is best mod, but ghosties comes close
<Barry> And the favors begin
<HaysforPonies> Dash needs to troll more with weather
<Hipster_Brony> 8ceiling pony is best pony
<Dr_Klaus> PP, RD, and rarity were shown upset
<mib_8u49qi> 0applejack has the best reason
<LonelyAstronaut> IF THERE'S ONE THING I CAN'T STAND
<LonelyAstronaut> ITS GROVELING
<Mac> she probably put the cloud there too
<ValtheJean> Ceiling Pony > Ceiling Cat
<Dr_Klaus> obviously she was gonna pick Fluttershy and Applejack
<ForTheBronies> 0Suddenly... BEAM OF LIGHT
<Purple`Prose> Twilight is unamused

<ThePretender> reminds me of Metroid Prime music
<Elky> you can listen to music and you can play a game, why combine the two?
<ChivalryPony> Can he draw Applejack with the other hand?
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> Avast Fluttershy's Ass was created by Wooden Toaster then added extra stuff
<Rainbow_Dash> Dermathil, no problem. I'd have it done in 10 seconds flat.
<Elky> nesmith: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C_HReR_McQ

<DSNesmith> it's real cheap on steam
<mib_8u49qi> 0i like this! :)
<DSNesmith> it's like 10bucks or something
<Zeh_Owned> agreed\
<ninjapwny> its so...hypnotising

<ForTheBronies> 0Hax?
<Dr_Klaus> eeeeeeeee
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> 10$? for 10 bucks you could get Deus Ex: GOTY edition.
<Zeh_Owned> just wait for a sale, it will be practically free
<Ghosties> 4Post-rock is excellent music to play Audiosurf to...actually, post-rock is excellent music regardless
<Dashite> It regularly goes on sale on Steam.
<Dr_Klaus> soft reverb is what sells it
<ChivalryPony> LUDICROUS SPEEED.
<DSNesmith> you need fast beats for fun songs
<Elky> ugh, I prefer the non-extended edition
<Dashite> Usually for like $2.50
<ninjapwny> well im leaving
<DSNesmith> drum and bass is the way to go

<Octavia> 13We must go deeper!
<Dermathil> 9Looks like Dermathil's blasting off again!!!!!!!! (Goodnight all, and you can give the theatrical exit kick please, Octavia.)
<herospirit> Because in my dream I actually told a Pony "I wish you were real." They said "I know" and began to cry.
<Dashite> My dreams (at least the recurring ones) are more scripted than CoD games.
<herospirit> That's when I discovered I still had emotions!
<Octavia> 13:)
<Darf14> Good way to send someone off to bed by giving them a good kick
<Octavia> 13Lmao

<SpitJack> im a pony whore as well
<herospirit> Stop your slander Darf!
<Darf14> sorry
<herospirit> Medic would never be so uncouth
<SpitJack> my current favs are spitfire, applejack, applebloom, scootaloo, and twilight
<SpitJack> sparkle

<Darf14> me neither
<SpitJack> i dont blive that
<SpitJack> twilight is really good
<Turtaguin> IS MOTHERFORKING BACK, MOTHERFORKER!

<herospirit> HEY, there are NO WORST PONIES.
<herospirit> :[
<Dashite> Least best?
<Darf14> Rarity is my least favorite...that is until I saw the Diamond Dogs episode
<SpitJack> thats a dumb reason to dislike
<herospirit> Not even least best. I can let "least favorite" slide though.
<Turtaguin> flutterdash/rainbowshy is best pony
<Dashite> Sounds good.
<SpitJack> who wants to see my fluttershy meme????/??

<Xaneco> I like anything that makes you think... or makes you sad... or anything dark... so would i like elfen...?
<LammyWolf> yes
<Dat_Pon-3> youd love Elfen
<LammyWolf> anypony rememeber reign????
<Dat_Pon-3> it has a very i guess u can smart storyline that will get to you in a way
<TwilightSparkle> 0best. parody. ever http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY&feature=feedf
<Dat_Pon-3> it is graphic too tho :D
<LammyWolf> that was played tonight
<Xaneco> I'd a weird insomniac human that stays up all night thinking...
<Xaneco> i'm*
<Xaneco> and then ponies
<Dat_Pon-3> the opening for Elfen Lied sounds like your going to hell or something
<Xaneco> they found their way into my heart
<LammyWolf> ha not really
<Dat_Pon-3> lol
<LammyWolf> just sad serious and gloomy
<Sumica> Guh Reign, yeah I recall that pile.
<Xaneco> wonderful, i'll watch it tonight
<LammyWolf> HORRIBLE SHOW ^
<Dat_Pon-3> i have it on my ipod and as a ringtone on my phone
<Dat_Pon-3> Lilium
<Sumica> NewDCD needs to add FMP to his saterday lineup.
<LammyWolf> raritys new dress =[
<LammyWolf> just read it
<Xaneco> ._.
<Dat_Pon-3> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k78BiUOPK0&has_verified=1
<Xaneco> is it long...?
<LammyWolf> was cupcakes long?
<Xaneco> ay, you read bittersweet...?
<Xaneco> cupcakes was short
<LammyWolf> i was thinking mre the sequel
<LammyWolf> its ehh, depend on your point of view i guess
<Dashite> "There are at least 17 Leviathans currently known to exist on Tranquility. Three of them belong to the Mostly Harmless alliance"
<LammyWolf> i thought both cupcakes were long
<Dat_Pon-3> u know whats my one of my fav openings in anime tho
<Dashite> >Mostly Harmless
<Dashite> >Own 3 Leviathans.
<Dat_Pon-3> the Gantz opening is just sweet
<Dat_Pon-3> badass
<hi> is Sparkle a surname
<hi> :O
<Dat_Pon-3> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omkvD2kq1uc
<LammyWolf> i like the first soul eater opening
<LammyWolf> i hate Kai, but i liked dragon soul
<LammyWolf> the opening for it
<Dat_Pon-3> i never watch soul eater but i like paper moon
<Xaneco> ._. i just remembered...
<Sumica> they are not that great of a ship Dashite, kind of hard to hit a moving target with a weapon firing rounds the size of busses.
<Xaneco> one of my friends is planning on getting a tattoo of twilight sparkles cutie mark :D
<LammyWolf> soul eater and gurren lagen are my most recent
<Dat_Pon-3> Rock the Dragon best DBZ opening lammy
<Dashite> True, but I just thought the idea of an alliance called "Mostly Harmless' having multiple titans kinda funny. :D
<Cesco> I think that Sparkle could be argued both ways - Pinkamena Dianne Pie seems to imply that the second part could be. But then, why isn't Rarity's name "Rarity Belle?"
<LammyWolf> lolwut?^
<Dat_Pon-3> when i heard Rock the Dragon i felt like kicking someones ass lol
<LammyWolf> random conversation for no raisen
<Dat_Pon-3> I WAS PUMPED
<Cesco> "hi" asked if sparkle was a surname
<Dat_Pon-3> one of the best openings ever
<Cesco> maybe my chat thing is delayed
<LammyWolf> oh lul
<Xaneco> why are all the mane 6's names 3 sylables... other than twilight
<LammyWolf> idek
<Dat_Pon-3> along with the first Pokemon opening and Sailor Moon
<Dat_Pon-3> I WANNA BE THE VERY BEST!

<Wrek> 5Pinkie_Pie: oo i love it, who's the author?
<ValtheJean> I always loved that derpy was there for no reason :P
<ValtheJean> and ah, ty Synros
<Pinkie_Pie> I have no idea.
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<Wrek> 5jsut noticed derpy
<Wrek> 5mfw
<ValtheJean> lol
<Pinkie_Pie> It is from ponybooru. "From anon 2 anon"
<Daz> Pinkie_Pie: there's a 30k one rite? xD
<Daz> i mean the poster
<Pinkie_Pie> Not of that one. There is of the comic con poster.
*ValtheJean loves the comic-con poster
<ValtheJean> even if they forgot Caramel :P
<Radagast> Was Dinky on the poster?
<ValtheJean> You know...I don't think she was
<ValtheJean> LEGASP! What if they don't make her canon? :(
<Wrek> 5makes who canon?
<ValtheJean> Dinky
<Radagast> She wasn't canon the moment the Apple family came in different colors.
<Wrek> 5link
<ValtheJean> of Dinky?
<ValtheJean> sec, while I open up photobucket :P
<Pinkie_Pie> Madame le'flour is on the poster.
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<Pinkie_Pie> To the comic con poster?
<Daz> dinky?
<Pinkie_Pie> http://miburl.com/l3HG4C
<Pinkie_Pie> Click it twice to zoom in to its real size
<Pinkie_Pie> Its terrifying
<Pinkie_Pie> And there is an even bigger one
<Daz> Pinkie_Pie: the 30k one is truly terrifying
<Wrek> 5i meant dinky
<Wrek> 5...
<ValtheJean> sec, I have tons of pics up
<Daz> 30,000 x 19,824. oshitson
<ValtheJean> http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/130506385337.png
<Pinkie_Pie> I swear im gonna get that printed out Daz
<Wrek> 5oooh her
<Pinkie_Pie> My whole wall will be ponified.
<Daz> Pinkie_Pie: same! just not yet :P
<Wrek> 5never got it intom y head that she was named dinky
<ValtheJean> this one always makes me "D'AWWWWWWWWW"
<ValtheJean> http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/130723373213.png
<ValtheJean> and yeah
<ValtheJean> Dinky comes from the fact that Derpy's canon name is Ditzy Doo
<ValtheJean> so it would be Ditzy Doo and Dinky Doo
<Daz> this means either the father was a unicorn, or all 3 races contain the genetics for all 3 races. from what we've seen from families, though, this probably isn't the case. so ... dinky's father is a unicorn?
<ValtheJean> and then there are *some* people who speculate the non-ditzy doo pony that brought back the birds was her sister Daisy Doo
<ValtheJean> well, Lauren did say it was possible to have different species ponies
<Daz> she did? i c.
<ValtheJean> which I prefer, just because I like keeping Dinky's father a mystery :P
<Daz> it's just, all families we've seen are all the same races as parents / siblings
<ValtheJean> yeah, but that's probably an animation thing
<ValtheJean> and honestly, they probably didn't even consider it until someone asked them about dinky
<Daz> i thought it worked well. : /. I liked to believe all genes for races were recessive, so it's 50 / 50 the race of the kid if bot hparents are different races.
<Daz> and ofc 100% the kid will be the race of both parents if the parents are of teh same race
<Daz> that's how I saw it
<ValtheJean> well, they'll probably never elaborate further on that note :P
<ValtheJean> it was probably more of a "Sure, let's throw them this so it's easier to say Ditzy is Dinky's mother" :P
<Daz> :P
<Pinkie_Pie> Im waiting for Rainbow_Dash to come online. All day if I have to
<Radagast> If I was in charge, I'd just say "whatever"
<ValtheJean> >yfw the first scene in S2 has Derpy and Dinky together
<Pinkie_Pie> Ponychan will explode if that happens.
<Pinkie_Pie> Twice.
<ValtheJean> can it do that? Can it explode twice?
<Pinkie_Pie> I dont know D=
<ValtheJean> Okay...so let's say that Ponychan exploded...and then exploded again...and then
*ValtheJean is shot
<Pinkie_Pie> How do you do emotes like that?
<ValtheJean> just type /me
*Pinkie_Pie Pinkie Pie bounces in place
<Pinkie_Pie> Yes...
<ValtheJean> thar you go :P
<Daz> >mfw scene 1 has derpy and dinky, octavia, luna, dr whooves, a load of other popular characters (like Colgate) all there as official, non-reusable-background, characters.
<Daz> ValtheJean: and then ponychan was a zombie
<ValtheJean> I think I would fangasm so hard Daz I'd be put into a coma
<ValtheJean> and lol
<Daz> ikr
<Pinkie_Pie> And then 4chan is infected
<Daz> cannot WAIT for s02 soooo muuuuuch
<Barry> Hi

<Pinkie_Pie> So basically I could make my own chat room and we could go there and watch it?
<Pinkie_Pie> Sounds complicated..
<Dermathil> it isn't
<War> " you're a dog on a leash" "if i say bark, you bark" IMMA FUCKIN FUCK HIM UP NEXT TIME I SEE 'IM

<ValtheJean> I've had that ad pop up too shad
<ValtheJean> right now it's on "Meet Christian Singles"
<Pinkie_Pie> http://miburl.com/GkQnbb
<ValtheJean> I'm guessing that's on memebase?
<ValtheJean> errr, demotivational
<Purple`Prose> I remember the most ironic video/banner ad combination I've seen
<Purple`Prose> I was watching a recording of a speech from the recent Oklahoma Freethought Convention...that had a banner ad for an online Christian Prayer Meeting service.
<ValtheJean> *facehoof*
<ValtheJean> also ohai Purple`Prose, I don't think I saw you log on :P

<ValtheJean> I get a 4chan message for some reason >.<
<Pinkie_Pie> http://miburl.com/FrMkOr
<Pinkie_Pie> Above: Not for the faint of heart
<ValtheJean> lol
<AllisZero> Because it is a 4chan thread
<ValtheJean> don't think I've seen that one before
<AllisZero> http://images.4chan.org/gif/src/1314425524587.gif

<AllisZero> Nooo Fluttershy
<Pinkie_Pie> I dont think you can link images directly from 4chan.
<ValtheJean> I'm just going to stop clicking pinkie's links for fear of my sanity :P
<AllisZero> Ah, gotcha.
<AllisZero> http://miburl.com/5hnPD1
<Pinkie_Pie> Aw.. I promise I wont post any more Secret Brush Fun

<AllisZero> She comes in so happy
<AllisZero> Baws
*FreezeFrame attempts to rip Boondock Saints *again*, since it didn't want to work last time.
<FreezeFrame> And I did the wrong side, anyway. Ripped the full-screen instead of wide-screen.
<ValtheJean> lol
<Pinkie_Pie> Val
<ValtheJean> yessums?
<Pinkie_Pie> I have to regain your trust. Here is an exceptional comic, but you have probably already seen it
<ValtheJean> lol
<Pinkie_Pie> http://miburl.com/QI5pU2
<AllisZero> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<AllisZero> NOT
<ValtheJean> hahaha, oh god, now I feel like a complete ass
<AllisZero> THE COMIC
<AllisZero> NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<AllisZero> oh god there goes my will to live for the rest of the weekend
<ValtheJean> you're forgiven seeing as you weren't there for when we were discussing this comic
<Pinkie_Pie> ._.
<ValtheJean> but I actually hate that comic with the force of a thousand suns >.<
<Pinkie_Pie> Whats wrong with the comic..
<FreezeFrame> AllisZero: Really? You mean old happy Dash reflecting on her life is that depressing?
<ValtheJean> well, Allis tears up any time he sees it. I myself find it WAY too cheesy
<ValtheJean> it also reminds me of the completely unnecessary love for RD
<ValtheJean> when she is the most single dimensional character
<FreezeFrame> The part that makes me tear up in it is the missing man formation.
*Pinkie_Pie Pinkie Pies hair deflates
<Pinkie_Pie> Oh.. Ok.. Ill find a more happy thought
<Pinkie_Pie> >.>
<ValtheJean> lol, me sowwy pinkie :P
<ValtheJean> pro tip: I love Caramel. But I hate shipping with every bone in my body
<ValtheJean> mfw I have to actually add that disclaimer because nobody DRAWS my favorite character outside of shipping >: *
<AllisZero> @FreezeFrame I don't know exactly why, but anything that reflects on the past gets me depressed, sad or not.
<ValtheJean> >: (*
<Barry> Hi Pinkie.
<Pinkie_Pie> Hi
<Pinkie_Pie> http://miburl.com/cbyJdK
<AllisZero> I've got a weak spot for that kind of stuff, always have
<Barry> Say, which of your friends would you pick to plan a party if you couldn't?
<Pinkie_Pie> How about that one?
<FreezeFrame> That one is so much d'awwww
<ValtheJean> yeah, that one I like better
<AllisZero> Yep
<Pinkie_Pie> What do you mean, "If I couldnt"?
<Pinkie_Pie> Oh
<Pinkie_Pie> I read it wrong
<Pinkie_Pie> ...
<Pinkie_Pie> Berry Punch
<Pinkie_Pie> A Cross and an Arrow
<Pinkie_Pie> >=D
<Barry> lol
<ValtheJean> silly filly, that's not how you spell Caramel :P
<Pinkie_Pie> And thats how equestria was unmade.
<Barry> Of course.
<Pinkie_Pie> Wait
<Pinkie_Pie> Not Berry Punch
<Barry> But if it had to be another member of the elements of harmony, who do you think would best fill your shoes?
<Pinkie_Pie> Bubble Berry, is it?
<Pinkie_Pie> Rainbow Dash, she is the most energetic.
<Barry> Ah. So Bubble Berry if it could be anyone, and rainbow Dash otherwise
<Barry> That's cool
<FreezeFrame> Berry Bubble *is* another Element, though. :P
<Pinkie_Pie> Yeah
<Pinkie_Pie> Just look at him
<Pinkie_Pie> http://miburl.com/LKeaDF
<maxaminus> Hullo
<ValtheJean> hello maxaminus
<Barry> I meant other than laughter
<FreezeFrame> Okay, Firefox's App Tabs are the best new feature ever.
<Barry> So You'd choose Loyalty, RD
<Barry> Seems fair. From what I understand, she helped you make that party for Gilda
<FreezeFrame> I can actually maintain two seperate google logins with them.
<Pinkie_Pie> Yes, lots and lots of super duper pranks!
<Barry> lol
*Pinkie_Pie <-- Sucks at imitating Pinkie Pie
<Barry> Seems Gilda's not a prankster, though
<Barry> It's fine, though
<FreezeFrame> If I had to pick any of the Mane Six other than Pinkie, I'd actually pick Rarity. It'd be a different sort of party from a Pinkie Party, and I think the change of pace would be awesome.
*Barry says we can't all be star actors
<Pinkie_Pie> http://miburl.com/sQ3nrq
<Shad> no comment
<Pinkie_Pie> Actually, just go here to see them
<Pinkie_Pie> http://mlpfanart.wikia.com/wiki/Male_versions_of_the_main_cast_of_characters
<Barry> Let's see, put berry bubble and pinkie pie together and you get the end of the world. put rarity and elusive together and you get love-struck ponies
<FreezeFrame> I love Berry Bubble's Gala suit
<FreezeFrame> It's just so.... right.
<Pinkie_Pie> Read the fanfic A cross an a Arrow Barry
<Pinkie_Pie> Its awesome
<Barry> Put Applejack and Cousin Jay-Jay together and you get family. Put Fluttershy and Butterscotch together and you get... what do you get?
<Pinkie_Pie> Find out in the fanfic
<Pinkie_Pie> Its about the mane 6 getting sent to an alternate universe, where all the genders are swapped
<DecapPony> hai
<ValtheJean> hello decappony
<Barry> Put Rainbow Dash and Rainbow Blitz together and you get rivals. And we have yet to see what happens when Twilight and Dusk get together
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/story-on-cross-and-arrow.html
<ValtheJean> nerd rage?
<FreezeFrame> Ugh, the MKVs I'm making with MakeMKV aren't working in Media Player Classic
<Barry> I've read that story
<Barry> I'm up to date
<FreezeFrame> You get Neurosis :P
<Barry> lol
<DecapPony> its a good story, interesting plot
<Barry> Nice one, Freeze Frame
<Barry> Hi DecapPony
<RobotPinkie> hey brownies
<Pinkie_Pie> Plot, you say?
<ValtheJean> ohai robotpinkie
<FreezeFrame> At least they'll work in Windows Media Player
<DecapPony> what up robotpinkie
<RobotPinkie> yo ValtheJean, DecapPony

<Pinkie_Pie> http://whittykitty.deviantart.com/art/Deluxe-MLP-Fluttershy-253858058
<Barry> In fact, that one sparkle on Twilight looks like a censor. Just saying
<Pinkie_Pie> http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=110734041360
<ValtheJean> $300 for a plushie? no fucking thanks
<ValtheJean> I prefer being able to buy bread
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/ijFReZ then have a picture
<maxaminus> I'm interested to see how close they can get the toys to the cartoon. The cartoon ponies tend to have non-euclidian dimensions
<Pinkie_Pie> The most amazing plushie in the world
<Pinkie_Pie> Decap, im saving that picture for later use.
<Barry> Nice, Decap
<Barry> I like the rainbow censor
<FreezeFrame> I remember seeing a non-porn, pretty well done humanized Mane Six picture.
<ValtheJean> humanized ponies freak me the fuck out for some reason
<DecapPony> same here
<FreezeFrame> They're weird, yes.
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBWW1RT2BGQ
<Pinkie_Pie> De Magicz ^
<AllisZero> I'm doing my own version of humanized Mane 6 characters.
<AllisZero> Might take me a few months but I want to get it done.
<AllisZero> Well, wait
<jasperdett|irssi> k

<Sathi> ohai
<Jizzy_Hooves> Hi there

<AllisZero> Oh the horror, the horror
<Pinkie_Pie> I know what im going to do
<Pinkie_Pie> Im going to download the mp3 of a cupcakes read along
<Pinkie_Pie> And im gonna apply the g major effect to it
<Pinkie_Pie> ...
<AllisZero> Haven't listened to anything other than FiM music for the past two weeks
<Flutteryay> the "G Major" meme makes music theory nerds like me shake my head
<ValtheJean> lol, so long as you never link it to me, be my guest Pinkie :P
<Flutteryay> It's a funny meme, but pick a better meme
<Flutteryay> *Name
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/1s209a
<Flutteryay> because when I heard somebody mention "Winter Wrap Up in G Major" I thought they changed up the key
<ValtheJean> OMG WANT DECAPPONY
<AllisZero> > You will never go for a walk with baby Twilight
<DecapPony> sorry princess molestia already took her
<DecapPony> and named her george

<AllisZero> And I had a huge smile on my face the whole time, DecapPony
<Pinkie_Pie> Ok.. I think making cupcakes into g major might be a bit above my editing skills
<Pinkie_Pie> Nvm
<Pinkie_Pie> It would be for the good of equestria that I dont do it anyway
<Shad> as did I
<Pinkie_Pie> Also, my brain hurts now Decap

<AllisZero> Ah forget it, it's too hot upstairs to do anything outside of my room
<Sathi> 7Countdown is up

<Shad> watch the entire season again
<Pinkie_Pie> Are you really sure you want to take derpy with you DecapPony?
<ValtheJean> lol
<DecapPony> and again
<Shad> and again
<Pinkie_Pie> Think about the potential consequences.
<DecapPony> yes i do
<AllisZero> But I just did a week agooo /rarity whine
<Flutteryay> How come I can't pop out the high quality stream?
<ValtheJean> not sure
<Flutteryay> I just get an about:blank page. I allowed popups for the bronystate site
*Rarity *whine*
<Flutteryay> hmm
<ValtheJean> I get the same for the IRC chat popout, but I dunno
<RobotPinkie> I like having Season 1 on on the background while I do stuff...
<Pinkie_Pie> That Rarity was me. I did /quit after I said it
<ValtheJean> awwww
<Shad> dead countdown is dead
<ValtheJean> deh musicks!
*Sathi 7needs her machine for a moment :P
<AllisZero> Lol
<ValtheJean> lol
<Sathi> 7it will be back
<Pinkie_Pie> Sathi, what do I have to do to have pink text?
<ValtheJean> become a mod :P
<Sathi> 7apply to become a moderator?
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<Sathi> 7and pink is taken i'm afraid
<Pinkie_Pie> Aw, Ok
<RobotPinkie> every color is taken by now
<Shad> so no mod can have the same color as another mod
<Dermathil> hey Sathi
<Sathi> 7heya
<Flutteryay> I've got 99 moonrocks and an aeiou ain't one.
<Pinkie_Pie> Oh well, 99% of the things I say is posting more videos anyway
<RobotPinkie> except dark red and light grey :P
<Sathi> 7dark red is taken
<Dermathil> I managed to get a livestream running.
<Dermathil> Basically, every color's already taken I think.
<RobotPinkie> lol oh okay, every color except light grey
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/q2CLD5
<Dermathil> Wait, I think Light gray isn't taken
<AllisZero> >mfw we have over 17 million mods
<Pinkie_Pie> Light gray is hard to read, isnt it?
*ValtheJean is debating whether or not to go out and get subway, or just make ramen
<RobotPinkie> Light grey looks about the same as white.
*crono_flash says make ramen
<DecapPony> what ever you can do so you can watch pwnies
*Shad says make waffles
<RobotPinkie> very easy to read, it just... doesn't stand out
<ValtheJean> ramen it is :P
<Dermathil> Subway is goody.
<Dermathil> I wub Teriyaki chicken
<Pinkie_Pie> Is it possible to add more colours Sathi?
<AllisZero> Man, I'm seriously debating learning to decorate cakes JUST to make a Fluttershy cake for my birthday.
<Pinkie_Pie> You could just add a lighter shade of pink, which would fit better anyway.
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<ValtheJean> bah....now I can't decide any more >.<
<Sathi> 7We are working on a solution
<crono_flash> Flip a coin ValTheJean
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/ToArya my new favorite hero
<crono_flash> Deadpool is awesome!
<Pinkie_Pie> Why are there so many pictures of Marvel villians/heroes with ponies?
<RobotPinkie> I like when used an atomic bomb to take down a pirate ship...
<ValtheJean> because it's awesome :P
<AllisZero> RobotPinkie: I'd like to see that
<RobotPinkie> That was very heroic
<Sathi> 7http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqjm0e8q9p1qjmjvko1_500.jpg
<Shad> even fictional characters are bronies
<AllisZero> I don't follow comics, but deadpool might become the exception
<ValtheJean> Sathi: FUGGIN saved
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I really like Deadpool

<Sathi> 7http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/237/b/7/mlp___knights_of_harmony_by_kroliath-d47syg3.jpg
<Pinkie_Pie> I sent an application, but im not sure how much time I need to spend in the chat
<Sathi> 7well how much time you have for ponies?
<ValtheJean> Sathi: What is that even from? That looks familiar
<NoOne> so are the LotR movies the theatrical version or extended?
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/93oTX2
<Sathi> 7extended
<Pinkie_Pie> I have been here for 2-4 hours already, and im still having fun.
<Pinkie_Pie> If it is like this every day, I could spend quite a bit of time with you people
<Sathi> 7I love being around

<ValtheJean> NOW I'LL SHIFT INTO MAXIMUM OVER-DAWWWWW
<ValtheJean> http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/130723373213.png
<Pinkie_Pie> Has anyone noticed how he seems to be sort of tired in the show?
<AllisZero> Nobody has the right!
<Pinkie_Pie> Like it wore him out to put that bag on Applejacks back.
<AllisZero> I guess he was just sad
<AllisZero> But he seems like a laid back guy if anything
<ValtheJean> *shrug* who knows?
<NoOne> im wondering how he got hurt before applebucking season
<DecapPony> Big Macintosh?
<AllisZero> Yeah
<ValtheJean> lol, inb4 mafia torture pic

<AllisZero> Ah
<Pinkie_Pie> Its like he has a hard time picking it up
<Shad> it was a heavy bag
<Shad> I guess
<ValtheJean> well he's probably still hurt
<Pinkie_Pie> Applejack knows she is supposed to pack light.
<DecapPony> yay fluttershy!

<Shad> HOW DARE YOU
<SilverMane> ... I wish I didn't own that image...
<ValtheJean> lol
<Pinkie_Pie> I cant draw at all actually.
<AllisZero> I wish I hadn't seen that image
<Shad> I can't draw for my life :D
<SilverMane> trust me, there is far worse out there. want me to go find it?
<ValtheJean> no
<ValtheJean> NO
<ValtheJean> NO
<Shad> HELL no
<Pinkie_Pie> No
<SilverMane> good, because i'm not going to
<NoOne> i atemted to make myself as a pony.......it didnt work to well.....
*ValtheJean slaps Silvermane
<AllisZero> No
<ValtheJean> BAD PONY
<Pinkie_Pie> Rule 34 would be a bit to much.
<RobotPinkie> Good, SilverMane
<RobotPinkie> also ohai
<AllisZero> I'm glad we all agree
<SilverMane> bah, all the rule 34 has been seen by everypony anyways
<RobotPinkie> lolwut?
<AllisZero> Not I!
<ValtheJean> that doesn't mean we WANT to see it again
<Shad> Neither I
<Sathi> 7DONT POST IT
<Pinkie_Pie> It doesnt mean we all need to see it again.
<RobotPinkie> No, and please don't make me see it.
<SilverMane> *trololol*
<Sathi> 7posting is instant ban
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/7QmrYU
<SilverMane> Sathi, for the love of god, chill dude.
<AllisZero> ^ That's funny tho.
<Pinkie_Pie> Yeah, its fine as long as it doesnt actually show anything explicit.
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/ab9udn Have some GIF!
<RobotPinkie> It's in the rules, it's just best that everyone knows that.
<Sathi> 7Silvermane just telling the rules, secondly i'm a girl
<ValtheJean> when in doubt of whether or not something is questionable, I've found the best solution is to just not post it
<ValtheJean> isn't worth the ban
<NoOne> in soviet equestria.....
<DecapPony> PONIES DANCE YOU!
<Shad> *awkward silence*
<NoOne> shhhhh
<SilverMane> I am well aware of your gender, Sathi. Dude is an androgynous term. Or is it asexual term... non-gender biased? I need a thesaurus
<RobotPinkie> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-they-just-dont-like-you.jpg
<DecapPony> i like trains
<RobotPinkie> I like ponies.
<ValtheJean> this thread is now trains
<Shad> I like turtles
<Pinkie_Pie> http://miburl.com/HHIioa
<NoOne> die potato!
<SilverMane> I've been here for 2 months now, i know better than to post porn. Hence the *trololol*
<ValtheJean> to be fair
<ValtheJean> the warning came before the *trololo*
<Shad> ^
<Pinkie_Pie> Generally, you dont post anything that would be offensive to minors in any chat without a 18+ confirmation.
<NoOne> its not offensive if they dont know what it means...
<RobotPinkie> So no posts about best pony, then. Damn.
<SilverMane> I'm just gonna go sit in my channel and wait for someone... harg, this is just silly now
<Pinkie_Pie> Sathi, wanna see something funny?
<AllisZero> call of duty sucks
<AllisZero> Is anyone offended yet?
<Shad> nope
<AllisZero> Phew
<ValtheJean> AllisZero: OMG U R TEH LIEK NEWB U JUZ SUCK OMG NEWB!
<Shad> I play it occasionally
<Shad> but just for zombies
<Shad> multiplayer blows
<ValtheJean> *shivers* I can't believe I actually typed all that out
<DecapPony> TF2
<AllisZero> I like playing through the SP campaign of almost all shooters
<NoOne> im emotionally scared. CoD was the last game my grangran gave me before she died...
<AllisZero> But I hate multiplayer with a passion
<DecapPony> BF2 multiplayer is awesome
<Shad> multiplayer is a ragefest of complaining children
<AllisZero> :(
<Shad> in cod
<Pinkie_Pie> My dad died while I was watching transformers.. So I dont watch that either..
<NoOne> not realy, i agree
<Pinkie_Pie> Its a shame, I kinda liked the first one
<crono_flash> http://miburl.com/C6bZS1
<RobotPinkie> I think the Mane 6 are all pretty much equally awesome ponies.
<RobotPinkie> Anyone offended now?
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/YS448X Spike is awesome
<NoOne> i dont see why prople obsess over buying a 'new' game so they can play multyplayer, wich is almost a copy of the previous game
<Shad> pressed backspace and went to previous page
<Shad> I hate that D:
*AllisZero rips his shirt.
<AllisZero> HOW.
<AllisZero> DARE.
<AllisZero> YOU.
<Shad> so what did I miss
<RobotPinkie> I actually bought a game while out pony shopping, for once.
<Pinkie_Pie> Something else traumatized Allis
<Pinkie_Pie> Im not sure which image it was this time
<Pinkie_Pie> Nothing big though
<Shad> k
<DecapPony> was it spike?
<AllisZero> RobotPinkie said all Mane 6 are equal in awesomeness
<Shad> rainbow dash is about 20% cooler
<Shad> I HAD TO DO IT
<Shad> I HAD TO
<RobotPinkie> I'm sorry, AllisZero, I didn't pay attention at sensitivity training :(
<Pinkie_Pie> Its all about opinion.
<Pinkie_Pie> Anything more and it always turns out to be a pointless flame war
<AllisZero> Eh
<Shad> favorite pony gang wars
<RobotPinkie> lol, that was a pretty good video
<Shad> I loved that video :D
<AllisZero> You see the problem with people is that everyone loves confrontation
<ValtheJean> NO I DON'T ALLIS I ARGUE YOUR POINT
<Shad> as do I
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, I don't have a problem with people saying who they think is best pony.
<Pinkie_Pie> http://miburl.com/kqyVSr
<AllisZero> For fuck's sakes, we're mostly adults here watching MLP, I think we can all agree that we've got enough confrontation coming from the naysayers to get us all to stick together and accept others' favorite ponies!
<RobotPinkie> I mean really, who cares?
<Shad> I love everypony
<AllisZero> Me too.
<Pinkie_Pie> Me three.
<AllisZero> Honestly there isn't a character in the show I don't like
<ValtheJean> that's not how you spell Caramel :P *trollface*
<Shad> same here
<RobotPinkie> I... don't love Prince Blueblood, I'm sorry :(
<AllisZero> I'm not exactly fond of Scotaloo but
<Shad> OGOD BLUEBLOOD
<AllisZero> Well, shit. Ok, you got me there.
<Shad> *rage*
<RobotPinkie> I know you guys love him just as much as Twilight Sparkle, but...
<RobotPinkie> trololol
<AllisZero> NOW THAT'S A CHARACTER WE CAN ALL AGREE TO HATE
<ValtheJean> I actually like blueblood >.<
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/cWU6gi They crossed the beams.....
<Pinkie_Pie> Oh god.. Here it comes
<Shad> I love luna and she only had like 3 seconds in season 1
<Pinkie_Pie> http://miburl.com/ieYy4e
<RobotPinkie> FLAME WAAAAAAARS! *dons hazmat suit*
<AllisZero> Let's forget our differences in regards to our favorite ponies and embrace what makes us alike... our hate for Blueblood.
<NoOne> i dont see how blueblood is related to celestia
<ValtheJean> :(
<DecapPony> he isnt
<ValtheJean> @NoOne: He's a very very very very very distant nephew
<DecapPony> hes a professional troll
<RobotPinkie> He's a pony
<Shad> trollestria is best troll
<Pinkie_Pie> Allis, lets not. There is no point to express hate over anypony, and it will only make us argue.
<Pinkie_Pie> Even if Blueblood is a prick
<ValtheJean> but I LIKE arguing!
<Dermathil> Blueblood is kind of 40-or-so branches away from the princesses, but he is a nephew
<RobotPinkie> :D
<AllisZero> But but but... rarityyy
<Shad> BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ARGUUUUUIIIING
<Pinkie_Pie> I want laughter. Go.. Now.. Find funny pictures
<NoOne> THAN WHY THE HAY IS HE....aww nvm
<AllisZero> Dermathil: How did we find out about that though? Is it canon?
<Pinkie_Pie> Or else, ill break the 4th wall
<ValtheJean> it was from word of god
<Dermathil> AllisZero: I think it was someone from the team that commented about it on deviantart one day.
<RobotPinkie> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tU35za6epY8/TjXd5QJbzzI/AAAAAAAAJjg/9OcpSsTKc_g/s1600/derpy_in_socks_by_grilledcat-d427fov.png
<RobotPinkie> Have some Derpy in socks
<Dermathil> Been a REAL long while since I heard bout it tho
<NoOne> lol
<ValtheJean> I'm very certain it was Faust herself
<AllisZero> Ah, I see. I was interested in the whole Nephew thing
<Shad> she's doin it wrong
<RobotPinkie> ...or is she?
<ValtheJean> I may or may not have the pic related to it
<Shad> <O<
<Pinkie_Pie> http://miburl.com/EVPhFf
<ValtheJean> lemme browse through my faust comments folder
<RobotPinkie> ...yeah, actually she is...
<Pinkie_Pie> That is me leaving to come find you
<NoOne> maby everypony wlse is wrong
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/4zjCA6 me watching ponies for the first time
<Dermathil> Actually, I think it was saying that Blueblood is Celestia's nephew forty times removed or something.
<Pinkie_Pie> http://miburl.com/fLLI6A
<Pinkie_Pie> And that is me finding you
<DecapPony> O HAI PINKIE!
<Shad> Dat 4th wall
<RobotPinkie> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpiedgidJ51qincmao1_500.jpg
<RobotPinkie> And that's Lyra in socks
<NoOne> orly?
*Dermathil starts to hum the duck tales theme
<RobotPinkie> No, I'm lying, it's Zecora
<Shad> luna is best with socks
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/9rgXKA
<NoOne> where did this whole ponies in socks thing start
<AllisZero> :|
<Shad> I HAVE NO IDEA!
<AllisZero> Should I go spend 50-60 bucks of my own money to get my bro's PC back in action so we can play some Co-op together?
<NoOne> co-op what?
<Shad> co-op on what
<AllisZero> I'm honestly bored out of my mind and don't want to waste the rest of the weekend
<NoOne> if its portal 2 than hay ya
<AllisZero> Dungeon Siege 3
<Pinkie_Pie> Anypony here play Roblox or Runescape?
<Shad> Nope.avi
<NoOne> i played runescape....a long time ago....
<RobotPinkie> Portal 2 is awesome.
<Shad> I quit runescape AGES ago
<AllisZero> Any good Ps3 co-op games you guys know of, then?
<NoOne> no
<Pinkie_Pie> I used to play it alot, but it got boring after a while. I log in every once in a while to talk to my friends
<NoOne> not ps3 only
<NoOne> 360>ps3
<Shad> well I have an xbox so idk
<NoOne> PC>360
<Shad> INB4FLAMEWAR
<RobotPinkie> I don't think he was asking for exclusives... :P
<Dermathil> um, nope NoOne.
<AllisZero> Well, anything really. I played Army of 2
<Pinkie_Pie> Flame war imminent..
<Pinkie_Pie> Why.. NOONE
<AllisZero> That was entertaining enough
<Dermathil> PS3 can be cross-platform with PC. that is all.
<RobotPinkie> Resident Evil 5 was kinda fun in coop, I thought
<Shad> XBOX AND PLAYSTATION 3 ARE NOT BETTER THAN EITHER
<Dermathil> and this is the only argument you will ever need.
<RobotPinkie> much better than single player...
<Shad> ITS ALL PERSONAL OPINION
<Pinkie_Pie> ^
<AllisZero> Love and Tolerance for everyone's favorite ponies
<NoOne> oh god what have i done?! IM SORRY!
<AllisZero> But when it's video-games, find a trench
<RobotPinkie> I like PS3 the most, but I don't think it's better than 360. You can like something and still be objective about it.
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk-cziBPTNU&feature=related
<Pinkie_Pie> Flame war is over, watch quest.
<RobotPinkie> Nowai
<Shad> HOW ABOUT WE WATCH SUM PONIES
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/yxRk2G
<Pinkie_Pie> If one of you will set up a synchtube room, we can watch ponies.
<AllisZero> I saw that one
<Shad> I got synchtube to work and I have a playlist with all 26 episodes
<AllisZero> Funny shit
<Shad> ^_^
<Pinkie_Pie> Link?
<DecapPony> O HAI THERE SCOOTALOO!
<Sathi> 7 5hrs left ;)
<RobotPinkie> I guess there's some more time for Time Crisis, then.
<Sathi> 7pre-pre stream will go up in 2hrs
<Shad> waddat
<Shad> o:
<Pinkie_Pie> What will be in that Sathi?
<Pinkie_Pie> Music and other random stuff?
<NoOne> play 'Pinkies Lie' on a loop
<Sathi> 7non youtube requests :)
<DecapPony> we can has MLP mentally advanced in pre pre stream?
<NoOne> all will be good
<DecapPony> awww
<Dermathil> btw, very interesting article here: http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112562-Microsoft-Doesnt-Want-Sonys-Sloppy-Seconds
<Shad> no pony swag?
<Dermathil> Sathi, can I ask for Season two of DuckTales?
<Pinkie_Pie> Sounds fun
<AllisZero> Wow, nice. So Microsoft is hanging itself, pretty much?
<DecapPony> ducktales about daffy duck in space?
<AllisZero> Ah, no, now I get what he means
<NoOne> anyone else on the east cost, on the brink of geting hit by hurricane?
<Shad> NOPE
<Dermathil> This Means Xbox can have less games than PS3
<Shad> I live in michigan, no disasters here
<RobotPinkie> Not really a massive surprise, Dermathil... though the one big XBLA title that I'd want on PSN is Shadow Complex
<Pinkie_Pie> Im in South Carolina, but we havent even gotten any rain yet.
<Shad> NO MORE ARGUING ABOUT GAME SYSTEMS
<RobotPinkie> ...and that's not happening.
<DecapPony> WI, it nice here :D
<RobotPinkie> Who's arguing?
<Pinkie_Pie> Shad, link to that Synchtube room? We can watch that until the stream comes online
<NoOne> i just dont like that the ps3 i have cant lay ps2 games
<NoOne> that is all
<Dermathil> so, bigger games library in Playstation, add to that pc-crossplatform compatibility in Portal-2's case (with BOTH PC and Mac)
*Dermathil has a livestream
<DecapPony> PEOPLE PLEASE CALM DOWN ABOUT GAMING!
<Pinkie_Pie> Does it have ponies?
<RobotPinkie> I don't really like that either, NoOne, but eh... I don't really want European PS2 games anyway.
<Dermathil> not atm, Pinkie.
<Dermathil> I set it up today
<VioletVanilla> AND WHAT
<VioletVanilla> IS WRONG
<Shad> I might just put first season on shuffle for a while
<VioletVanilla> WITH EUROPEAN PS2 GAMES?! D<
<RobotPinkie> hey VioletVanilla
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/T2swex
<VioletVanilla> Our games are just as good as your games D:
<VioletVanilla> Helo RobotPinkie~ :3
<NoOne> lets watch 9:32:25 of ponies!
<RobotPinkie> lol VioletVanilla, European PS2 games are often slowed down by about 15% or so
<VioletVanilla> Slowed down? .-.
<RobotPinkie> I'm European, so that kind of makes it difficult for me to get the best versions of games....
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW_w5HZtp64&feature=related
<RobotPinkie> PAL is 50hz, NTSC is 60hz
<Dermathil> btw, I has begun a game of Darksiders LP in my livestream.
<NoOne> oblivion ftw
<VioletVanilla> I'm European too o:
<Pinkie_Pie> Yes
<NoOne> i want skyrim
<Pinkie_Pie> I want skyrim to.
*Dermathil has 40-or-so other games he can LP
<Guyandsam> when will the show star at 7 right
<Pinkie_Pie> I have it preordered for pc
<VioletVanilla> Oh well, yeah, that is true. . .
<RobotPinkie> Unless there's a 60hz option, the game has been slowed down
<Pinkie_Pie> 7pm EST time Guyandsam
<NoOne> and want old republic
<Guyandsam> kk thanks

<Pinkie_Pie> Goonswarm was an alliance that pretty much tried to take over the whole game.
<Pinkie_Pie> And they pretty much did
<Pinkie_Pie> Everyone hates them
<Dermathil> isn't it still around though?
<Pinkie_Pie> This is the game im talking about
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aegK7n7C5Z8

<Pinkie_Pie> Not as powerful as they used to be
<NoOne> i like the dominion trailer
<Pinkie_Pie> I can fly a t3 ship on eve.
<Pinkie_Pie> I just dont play it any more. Its more of a job than a game in most cases
<Pinkie_Pie> Still, its epic
<NoOne> i can fly a BIG PIECE OF BS
<Pinkie_Pie> A battleship?
<NoOne> ya

<Pinkie_Pie> A super carrier isnt something you can really get by yourself..
<NoOne> ya, and all the corps i was in kinda sucked
<Pinkie_Pie> If you have good enough skills your alliance will pay for one for you
<Pinkie_Pie> Assuming you are trusted
<Pinkie_Pie> And wont do something stupid and get it blown up
<NoOne> ya but its finding a good alliance that is the hard part

<interior_gummy> 0is it any good?
<Denied_Existence> 3I am having MOTHER II flashbacks here.
<Shad> OH GOD NO
*SilverMane is feeling this song
<interior_gummy> 0i've heard mixed
<HeavyMetalPony> Sea ponies are impervious to bullets. Shit.
<Sumica> Damn the high notes are radaling my headphones
<ValtheJean> from what I understand, the community is a bit divided on G1
*Pinkie_Pie is rotting from the core
<ValtheJean> we can all agree that G2-3.5 sucks ass
<ValtheJean> but some really like G1
<SirSprinkles> 6Sea Ponies: Your hate only makes them stronger
<SilverMane> G1 is hardcore but still targeted girls with the intent of toys
<interior_gummy> 0g2 wasn't a show, but g3 is universally hated
<Denied_Existence> 3This song
<Denied_Existence> 3Reminds me of MOTHER II
<Sathi> 7What is this song?
<HeavyMetalPony> I only saw the pilot, and the villains were awesome (before they all died/turned into humans)
<Sathi> 7lalala
<Denied_Existence> 3Or it might have been MOTHER I
*Sathi 7is happy
<interior_gummy> 0isn't g4 also partially about toys?
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm trying to show things I haven't shown before, for the most part.
*Sathi 7just pre-ordered SAM BFE
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/l9vugE
<RobotPinkie> SAM BFE?

<ValtheJean> silly interior_gummy, G4 is about FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!

<maxaminus> Well yeah. Think about Twilight's balloon.
<Sathi> 7Sam is awesome
<interior_gummy> 0SirSprinkles: like pinkie pie tlt uolliac?
<Sathi> 7and old-school
<Pinkie_Pie> Denied, why do you always say that?
<RobotPinkie> I have no idea what it is, Sathi :(
<HeavyMetalPony> What the hay is this song?
<Serious-Sammy> 7:D
<DecapPony> hai sammy!
<maxaminus> I'm surprised though, that the Elements of Harmony never got turned into toy jewelry.
<Denied_Existence> 3I don't remember Pinkie_Pie
<Serious-Sammy> 7Haii
<SirSprinkles> 6Repeatedly suggesting a video only reduces the chances of me playing it.
<Sumica> Holly highnote.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's like spamming the chat, and I'm not a fan of it.
<interior_gummy> 0i stop now, ja
<Pinkie_Pie> Challenge: Turn your volume all the way up
<ValtheJean> what if we keep suggesting Sea Ponies? *trollface*
<Pinkie_Pie> >=P
<HeavyMetalPony> Then should we suggest sea ponies?
<Denied_Existence> 3Also DecapPony, VAAAARRRRYYYY interesting

<ValtheJean> well, this is only in the musical

<Pinkie_Pie> A Goofy Movie? I dont remember this song..
<Sumica> ahhh right
<Shad> Oh the memories
<ValtheJean> which, I will say, was surprisingly better than I was expecting
<Amino> It's near the beginning
<Sumica> first song of the movie, I recall it now
<Pinkie_Pie> Hmm
<interior_gummy> 0Pm-ed you, Pinkie_Pie
<[ger]Brony1> Back from watching Cowboys and Aliens.
<HeavyMetalPony> That movie was awesome.
<HeavyMetalPony> IMO
<Amino> I second that
<Shad> I third that
<Denied_Existence> 3I...*yawn*...am tired for some reason...hmmmmm
<AllisZero> Young fluttershy was so small
<Pinkie_Pie> Speak for yourself

<Shad> blanket pls
<[ger]Brony1> Nah! Ninjas and Aliens was better. lol
<Pinkie_Pie> My feet are also cold.
<HeavyMetalPony> That's the sequel though
<Denied_Existence> 3*Crack* *Psssssssssst* *Slurp*
<Shad> OH I MEAN MY HOOVES
<interior_gummy> 0theory: fluttershy is the oldest, and the rest are the same age except twilight, who's a year younger
<[ger]Brony1> Wear socks
<HeavyMetalPony> I juts finished watching 127 Hours for like the fourth time, so I'm feeling super happy right now.
<JakeCake> Hello all, this is my first time here
<Shad> BUT WE DON'T NORMALLY WEAR CLOTHES
<ValtheJean> hello JakeCake
<ValtheJean> sit back and enjoy the ponies :P
<Denied_Existence> 3IDK
<[ger]Brony1> But ponies wear socks
<HeavyMetalPony> Hey Jakecake
<Shad> nope
<JakeCake> I will
<JakeCake> Glad to meet you all
<RobotPinkie> Hi JakeCake
<Shad> who started that ponies wearing socks thing anyway
<Amino> ALso first time here. /wave
<[ger]Brony1> Socks and saddles
<HeavyMetalPony> I don't like this song...but Fluttershy
<ValtheJean> hello Amino
<RobotPinkie> and hey Amino, too
<SirSprinkles> 6AppleJack is older than the others, since she was the last of her age to get her Cutie Mark.
<Denied_Existence> 3Hi, have some free ponies Jakecake:http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/facethumbs/6.jpg
<Shad> dat cheerilee face
<RobotPinkie> Cheerilee confirmed for most awesomeface pony
<Shad> PLS
<HeavyMetalPony> You can get cutie marks at differnt ages Sprinkles
<Shad> are you forgetting rainbow dash so awesome face?
<HeavyMetalPony> *different
<SirSprinkles> 6I know, HMP.
<ValtheJean> yeah, but she also said she was the last in her class to get a cutie mark
<ValtheJean> which implies she wasn't in the other's classes
<Denied_Existence> 3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/facethumbs/175.jpg
<NoOne> is it me or is the vid/stream jumpy
<RobotPinkie> Rainbow dash can't beat Cheerilee in an awesomeface contest.
<Amino> It's a little jumpy for me
<interior_gummy> 0also, rd and fluttershy went to a different school
<ValtheJean> it's doing that for me too noone
<HeavyMetalPony> It's not you
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm saying that since she was the last of her age group to get her CM, which was stated, she'd be older, since timeline-wise, Rarity got her CM after AJ did.
<Shad> fluttershy is a year older than pinkie
<interior_gummy> 0or she was just lying to make apple bloom feel better
<Shad> confirmed
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, that's confirmed.
<Pinkie_Pie> Fluttershy is a tree.
<AllisZero> She'd like to be a tree.
<DecapPony> WAAZZZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUPPPPPP
<Shad> i'd like to be a tree
<Denied_Existence> 3Fluttertry
