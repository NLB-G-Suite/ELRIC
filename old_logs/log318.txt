<kirzstryfe> 11,14dialogue tends to drive the story, hard to do one without it
<Phase4> http://youtu.be/8gXk8y7_qxY so much nostalgia
<kirzstryfe> 11,14I can give you the advise my mom used to pound into my head whenever I had to write something
*LadyCanary bounces along to the theme

<SaxyPretender> 0,14Apparently
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it can stop nosebleeds
<Dermathil> Hey shizu
<kirzstryfe> 11,14I can offer to help with editing and working out the dialogue within the story if you'd like

<StinkomanFan> Thanks, but I still don't know what to write it about, It's like I have tons of ideas but none of them are worth fleshing out...
<kirzstryfe> 11,14I've always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy stories, stuff that sets up its own world

<Phase4> night Nyria
<PartyCannon> And night Nyria
*Dashie_Dashie comes back clicks link, suddenly bacon tampons.
<emangamer> does anypony know where my store will be hiding the blind bags when they carry them? Will they be with the normal merch stuff?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01K
*IshBestKitty purrs and rubs against Phase4
<kirzstryfe> 11,14to stop the no-title issues
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, EqD did make no-title posts.
<Phase4> btw, eqd's rss feed. anyone got a link?
<kirzstryfe> 11,14no idea emangamer, the ones near me haven't gotten them yet
<prince-dari> If you check the EQD source it's there.
<kirzstryfe> 11,14but I would guess either on a clip strip in the aisles or a box near the trading card section
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Speaking of that, I made a tumblr account today. Would you like an Ask Nittany Discord?
<emangamer> kirzstryfe: I have heard in the trading card section from some ponies
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: you should follow me
<prince-dari> Phase4: http://www.equestriadaily.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss
<Phase4> prince-dari: found it, didnt know link elements could be used like that
<kirzstryfe> 11,14I've seen the knock-off pony blindbags in that section, so I'd assume that's where the real ones would end up
<ScootaChicken> If I could draw I would make a tumblr
<IshBestKitty> meow
<emangamer> kirzstryfe: knockoff blindbags?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or Ask Cold Front (another OC).
<ScootaChicken> but drawing makes my brain hurt...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't draw, but I can.
<LawnchairRawket> What's this about blindbags now?
<emangamer> watch my store have blind bags and me not even know
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If enough people want it, I'll draw.
*IshBestKitty I Can haz Cheezeburger
<StinkomanFan> That's it! A western! As a child people tend to want to be one or two things: a space man or a cowboy! If I can just take a curmudgeny old punk with no respect for his fellow man, put him into Equestria it'd be as easy to write as a trollfic!
<emangamer> I think I am over my drawing phase
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because drawn ask blogs > text ask blogs IMO.
<emangamer> its too much work for not enough awesomeness
<StinkomanFan> Plus it's original!
<IshBestKitty> meow
<ScootaChicken> you had a drawing phase?
<ScootaChicken> oh lawd
<Dashie_Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZNKzcbNfHA&feature=related
<emangamer> ScootaChicken: it lasted about one week
<LawnchairRawket> Blah.
<LawnchairRawket> Again, what's this about blindbags?
<StinkomanFan> Thanks kirzstryfe I owe you one
<Phase4> ScootaChicken: ???

<Shizuka> 13because aelita
<Derpy_1337> of corse some cliche
<Ditzy> that would be too easy
<RawketLawnchair> Because that would destroy Aelita.
<Dermathil> Rawrity: the girl is stuck inside

<RaveBrony> Yeah, i know xD
<RawketLawnchair> And we find out a whole lot of other stuff in the later seasons why destroying the super computer would be super bad.
<RAWRity> Dermathil: Save 1 girl and in the process risk your family, friends, and the lives of hundres of innocent bystanders?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yay for fanfictions ^_^

<RAWRity> I can't remember, did they still use the "Reset it all" line after the reset thing stopped being a factor?
<Yahooz> mfw there is a ________________ user
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Me neither, I actually hated the show :P
<Randomnerd> Dem freshly washed sheets.
<CriticKitten> I can't remember when I saw Code Lyoko, only that by that point I'd already tasted other animes and was starting to give up on American cartoons. :p
<Shizuka> 13they did on rare occasion
<Derpy_1337> this is looooooooooooong
<Derpy_1337> GUMMY yay!
<RaveBrony> I loved Code Lyoko! Makes me happy to see it again
<RawketLawnchair> Twilight is a mage.
<RawketLawnchair> Not a Paladin.
<Shizuka> 13pretty much only when something world-threatening happened, otherwise once aelita was out the war was mostly confined to lyoko itself
<RAWRity> also, Code Lyoko is not an anime.
<RaveBrony> So many smiliey ponies!
<Derpy_1337> RaveBrony me 2 sorta
<Yahooz> XD
<Dermathil> Hey Shizu, what was his name again? the traitor.

<MirrorImage> RawketLawnchair: nah, Twilight would multiclass everything she could
<Yahooz> who is streaming btw?
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: exactly.
<Dermathil> William was a BAMF
<Dken2021> the show took too long to get anywhere in every episode, but that sorta changed in later seasons
<CriticKitten> Doesn't change the sentiment behind my statement.
<CriticKitten> :p
<LadyCanary> SB is Yahooz

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Nope, somepony who linked their image
<kirzstryfe> 11,14lol
<RawketLawnchair> Also, that's not a swrod, that's a Crickiet bat, Shizuka .
<RAWRity> Shizuka: William was where I stopped watching.
<CriticKitten> By the time I saw Lyoko, I'd basically given up on American stuff in favor of anime-style cartoons.
<Dermathil> >mfw I got kicked for typing normal speed
<Yahooz> since he is streaming... le Cafe?
<Shizuka> 13that was just before season 4, aka the best season ever

<RAWRity> God, this series had the fuckiest character designs...
<Randomnerd> Not my favorite.
<Ditzy> not even christian bale
<CriticKitten> Dem evil clowns~
<Randomnerd> Not. At. All.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I actually...liked this series >.>
<RAWRity> Still, it looks to still be better than "Beware the Batman"
<Derpy_1337> that joker looks like a zombie
<Dken2021> The Riddler = Man in pajamas
<Fleur> they look weird
<Kencolt> It also had some very very dark storylines.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02This show doesn't make sense AT ALL with the storyline
<Dumori> Freaky char design is good char design
<LadyCanary> I never saw it, so I cant say.
<kirzstryfe> 11,14BB has its good parts
<LadyCanary> But Ive heard negativaty about it.
<Derpy_1337> Im bored
<Ditzy> awww yeeaaa
<Randomnerd> Justice League was fun :)
<RAWRity> still, "The Batman" was okay. A lot better than THIS is looking to be: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/70/Bewarethebatman-promotional.jpg
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, you know what was my favorite Spider-Man series
<RaveBrony> I didnt watch Justice League much
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Spectacular Spider-Man
<RaveBrony> Sadly :\
<Ditzy> i loves me some dark knight
<CriticKitten> Justice League wasn't too bad, aye
<SuperBrony64> 10,02yfw Luke Skywalker was The Joker
<kirzstryfe> 11,14was that the 90s one Saxy?
<RawketLawnchair> Oh my god. . .
<Randomnerd> Yeah :D
<RAWRity> Justice League was pretty good, but I never could get into Unlimited.
<LadyCanary> :O NO WAI SuperBrony64
<RawketLawnchair> What's wreong with their faces?
<Midnight_Tempest> lol mark hamill is the joker... luke skywalker is best badguy
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yup

<Derpy_1337> pointy chin alert
<LadyCanary> <3 That laugh

<Randomnerd> Trololol
<NullRadix> Joker is best troll
<Ditzy> even better
<SaxyPretender> 0,1490s one is my second favorite by a verrry close margin
<Randomnerd> Mr. Freeze FTW
<RawketLawnchair> Mrk Hamill is best Joker.
<CriticKitten> Dat laugh. It will haunt your nightmares. <3
<Kencolt> Unlimited had a incredible moment in "the once and Future Thing", where Batman, GL, and Wonder Woman were teamed up with Bat Lash, Jonah Hex, El Diablo and Smith on horseback with a rendiition of the Justice League OP music-- is mWestern style.
<RawketLawnchair> Jesus christ how horrifying.
<RaveBrony> I agree CriticKitten
<LadyCanary> Ahhh that laaaauuugh <3 it makes me so HAPPY.
<MistarFish> Use the laugh luke

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Turtle? lol wut

<RaveBrony> That looks absolutely Horrid

<SuperBrony64> 10,02You all probably didn't know that Tara Strong did Harley Quinn in Arkham Asylum, right?
<Midnight_Tempest> ^
<Ditzy> buttman indeed

<LadyCanary> I knew dat SB64
<MirrorImage> SuperBrony64: actually, i think we did
<CriticKitten> I just don't know how anyone will top Mark Hamill's Joker. Heath Ledger did a good interpretation for Dark Knight, but I still think Hamill's is a wee bit better for me.
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: We all knew that.
<RaveBrony> Oh man....
<MirrorImage> it was a badly kept surprise
<SuperBrony64> 10,02YOU ARE ALL TOO SILLY THEN
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tara Strong did Princess Clara of Drawn Together.
<Derpy_1337> TARA STRONG? who knew?

<Flaira> 'ey champ
<Lasharus> I'm usually just Lasharus.
<Lasharus> Granted, sometimes it's Dr. Robotnik.
<Phase4> and hen i accidentaly clicked on the stream and it closed my chat
<Flaira> RAWRity: As soon as I heard who was nominated I stopped paying attention
<herostar> what potions can be created in skyrim with diadra hearts?
<Phase4> then'
<SuperSonic64> Alright, stream is live again
<Randall1160> and then everyone was pony
<Derpy_1337> PINGAZ
<Yahooz> Sometimes its Flar(insert creative twist to nick that seems fitting at the time)

<bluestrom_S> is the stream down>?
<Phase4> SuperBrony64: i see no stream
<herostar> mmk
<Yahooz> SnooPINGAS usual I see?
<IngloriousPony89> you also need ebony for daedric armor
<RAWRity> Flaira: Good move. I'm been seething in rage over some of the snubs this year. Especially after rewatching The Ides of March
<Derpy_1337> dr. robotnic : PINGAS
<herostar> i see add but no stream
<SuperSonic64> Nvm
<SuperSonic64> Fixing
<Lasharus> And speaking as Doctor Robotnik: Yahooz, Derpy_1337? If you hear a whistling noise outside, it's not a warhead. It's just a reminder of all the good times we shared...
<Yahooz> XD

<Lasharus> It won't be an issue for very long.
*Lasharus laughs maniacally.
<Phase4> yeah, streams still broken here

<Randall1160> just sayin
<Lasharus> How could I be promoted Yahooz? I'm already the greatest scientific genius in the world!
<RAWRity> I mean, c'mon. I can see War Horse and The Artist getting Best Picture noms, but Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close? The Descendants? The Help? bleh. and Drive didn't even get a mention.
<Lasharus> Also, the Robotnik you're referencing is from a cheap knockoff cartoon that they made of me. That version of me is an idiot.
<Derpy_1337> I deserve a..... pppppprrrroooooomotion
<IngloriousPony89> Critic RAWRity
<Yahooz> I thought I was...0_0
<Lasharus> An amusing idiot, but an idiot
<Midnight_Tempest> so, SB is gonna play Sonic Generations now eh?
<Yahooz> Idiotic idiots!
<Lasharus> Well, I'm hoping he will Midnight_Tempest. :P
<RAWRity> SB is gonna have us watch Sonic X
*Phase4 just remembed that derpy is now canon, and is still having trouble beliving it

<Lasharus> I only suggested it to him as a laugh, but who knows. :P
<Lasharus> I know he owns the game.
<Yahooz> THE CHAMP! : D
<Midnight_Tempest> god i hope not RAWRity
<Lasharus> (And hasn't finished it!)
<herostar> :P
<LadyCanary> Sleeep then Randall1160 :3
<IngloriousPony89> Now I'm tired Randall
<Phase4> night Randall1160
<Randall1160> c: I should
<Randall1160> But I am not yet
<Midnight_Tempest> i just now that SB is gonna play sonic generations... my steam keeps telling me so
<Yahooz> oh god... ANYTHING BUT SONIC X
<Randall1160> I am not going yet!
<Derpy_1337> gee it sure is boring around here mah boi this peace is what all true warriors strive for i just wonder what ganon is up to
<Lasharus> He could also be going for Sonic Unleashed, but that one was not as good.
<Randall1160> FOUR!
<Randall1160> FOOT
<emangamer> I'm back everypony (for a short time)
<Randall1160> dinner
<Lasharus> And if he streams Sonic X, I will personally end our enigmatic streamer.
<Phase4> Yahooz: this is suposed to be a good sonic, i supose we'll find out
<Randall1160> hai eman
<Midnight_Tempest> but i like Sonic Unleashed
<Yahooz> ohey emangamer
<Derpy_1337> mmmmmmm bombs
<Lasharus> So do I Midnight_Tempest. But you can't deny that the game was mental.
<Lasharus> I mean, really. The 'werehog'?
<Yahooz> AoStH would be great
<Lasharus> The gameplay was decent, but the concept?
<Phase4> sonic unleashed was witten like poop voiced like poop and played like poop
<emangamer> Lasharus: werehog is a misnomer because were means man. Sonic is not a manhog. More accurate would be hogwolf or wolfhog
<KetaminaDianePie> the concept was to move gamers away from the wii
<Lasharus> Phase4: WRONG.
<Phase4> it was more poop than actual poop
<Lasharus> Yes emangamer, I've seen that Zero Punctuation too.
<Yahooz> stream...
<Midnight_Tempest> maybe, but it was one of the best sonic games since Sonic Adventure 2 Battle on the gamecube
<emangamer> Ohai SuperBrony64
<Lasharus> It was completely insane Phase4, I'll admit.
<Lasharus> BUT!
<SuperSonic64> STREAM IS UP
<Phase4> Lasharus: wrong?
<Lasharus> Robotnik was awesome.
<emangamer> Lasharus: I know, it's nice to be so smug....
<SuperSonic64> Let me know if you see the game
<emangamer> BLEH sonic...really?
<Derpy_1337> lamp oil rope bombs you want it you can have it as long a you have enogh rupees
<Lasharus> Ghehe, sorry emangamer. :p
<Lasharus> Also, this has to be done again.
<SuperSonic64> You see the game?
<LadyCanary> Sonic Generations? Hm. Alright then!
*Lasharus tacklehugs SuperSonic64.
<RawketLawnchair> Saga?
<emangamer> Ohai LadyCanary <3
<Dken2021> oh look, something sonic

<RawketLawnchair> Sonic is neat.
<Amras0000> finally
<Midnight_Tempest> he's gonna play some levels... then i will try to beat his bests
<IngloriousPony89> Ooooo generatons

<Lasharus> And yes SuperSonic64 - we see this.
<Derpy_1337> à² _à²  i disaprove
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I recently saw Yahtzee's review of Sonic Generations.
<IngloriousPony89> ^
<IngloriousPony89> Funny
<Lasharus> I was surprised at how much he hated the game.
<IngloriousPony89> I wasn't
<Lasharus> But then, his reviews are based on him being a professional hater. :P
<Lasharus> And it was a funny review, definitely.
<Midnight_Tempest> Yahtzee hates everything Lasharus
<Yahooz> dat old/new sonic comparision
<Lasharus> Got there first Midnight_Tempest :P
<Dken2021> I don't like Yatzee, he seems to hate every game he reviews
<Phase4> dat music :>
<RAWRity> hey, if SB has a Kinect, he should totally play Sonic Free Riders
<LadyCanary> ...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There are games Yahtzee doesn't hate.
<IngloriousPony89> HA!
<SuperSonic64> Need to fix something
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Like Painkiller and Psychonauts.
<Lasharus> HA!
<KetaminaDianePie> AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Derpy_1337> sonic was origianaly pixelated so i dont get this game
<Randomnerd> Hah, lies! Yahtzee hates everything.
<Lasharus> That's true enough IngloriousPony89.
*emangamer is going to watch the newest ZP
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, I'm not a huge fan of ZP either
<Yahooz> ZP?
<Flaira> Sleep well, ponies~
<Lasharus> I really quite like Zero Punctuation.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Zero punctuation
<Dken2021> still, he complains about pointless stuff nobody cares about
*Flaira hugs #bronystate
<LadyCanary> I havent watched his reviews in a long time.
<RAWRity> Yahooz: Zero Punctuation
<Lasharus> Of course he does Dken2021.

<Flaira> <3
<LadyCanary> Hi Simon!
<Yahooz> not too much of a fan
<LadyCanary> Bye Flaria!
<Dken2021> hello Simon
<Yahooz> ohai Simon
<Randall1160> Byee flaira!
<Lasharus> His reviews aren't based on being accurate representations of the games. They're based on being satirical reviews of games. I don't think he expects people to take him 100% seriously.
<Phase4> ohai Simon
<Lasharus> He just spouts his opinion and a bunch of random comedic bollocks around it.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I know for the most part Yahtzee's stuff is an act, but it's too caustic for my tastes
<Midnight_Tempest> i need to get a windows xbox controller for this game, its hard to play with a keyboard
<Simon> I woke up so late, it's already 12:35pm
<Lasharus> That's perfectly fair Saxy. :)
<Derpy_1337> ima let my computor cool of so brb
<Phase4> Lasharus: well is a review not an opinion
<Dken2021> I know he does that for laughs, but whatever, not my cup of tea
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<Midnight_Tempest> yeah, im gonna check out the latest review too... forgot it was wednesday
<Lasharus> It's an educated opinion supported by rational explanation.
<Lasharus> Whereas Yahtzee is spouting his opinion supported by random bollocks. :P
<LadyCanary> I used to watch him quite a bit. While I like the guy on some levels, I guess I'm just not into his reviews anymore.

<Lasharus> Laters Derpy_1337.
<SuperSonic64> No
<Derpy_1337> just 10 min
<otakon> Shizuka: hi dear!
*Phase4 is going to agree to disagree with Lasharus about what his reviews are
*otakon hugs Shizuka
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Honestly, Xpadder is cheaper than buying a 360 PC controller.
*Randomnerd curls up under blankets
<SuperSonic64> Mine cost $30
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Those controllers are rip-offs.
<KetaminaDianePie> ......
<Lasharus> Soon KetaminaDianePie. The game will be streamed, worry not...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I need to configure my 360 Fightpad for when Fighting is Magic comes out
<Nittany_Discord> 11,013rd-party controllers are cheap.
<herostar> i jus went through more nooks of spells than twilight sparkle o_o

<IngloriousPony89> Oh God my cat's going on the offensive
<Dken2021> <Minotaur> I think I'll give you a tase of Holy
*kirzstryfe is going to disagree with Lasharus on the principle that it's more fun that way
<Lasharus> My brother gave me my XBox controller for PC for free Nittany_Discord. :P
<Phase4> hmmm, my copy of 'shadow of the colussos' should be ariving today or tomorow
*Lasharus sighs at kirzstryfe.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But any game build on XNA doesn't support 3rd-party controllers.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wouldn't mind having a 360 controller.

<Amras0000> but sad
*LadyCanary feels like singing.
<Phase4> its not so much sad as powerfull, worth a read
<Amras0000> and can potentially cause me to lose control over my emotions

*LadyCanary remembers crying in the theater with Toy Story 3.

*Fleur throws a shoe at KetaminaDianePie
<Fleur> no all caps
<LadyCanary> It is <3
<Phase4> all the toy stories are good'
<Randomnerd> I think that Toy Story works in 3D. In Live Action, it feels like a gimmick.
<LadyCanary> I saw it in 3D. It was pretty nice.
<Randomnerd> I mean, ugh... syntax.
<Fleur> Live action?
*Midnight_Tempest explodes
<Fleur> oh ok
<Randomnerd> Cartoons like Toy Story are good in 3D, you can suspend disbelief if it looks unrealistic.
<KetaminaDianePie> sory Fleur :(
<SuperBrony64> YEah, I'm still working on it :/
<Phase4> aparently i saw toy story on ice, but i was 4 or 5
<Randomnerd> But live-action films with 3D effects look gimmicky.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14I get to a point where it's pointed out against how there was a European country (I think Norway or Finland) that did surrender to Germany but they were able to get as many Jewish people out of the country and save a lot of lives
<Midnight_Tempest> i think that was norway
<SaxyPretender> 0,14a Troper from said country thanked the person who put that entry
<SaxyPretender> 0,14for making them realize that Norway did something useful despite giving in
<SaxyPretender> 0,14someone else said "No need, your country saved a lot of lives"
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and I just lost it
<SaxyPretender> 0,14started crying

<SaxyPretender> 0,14but I felt so incredibly moved
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and it's the small things like that
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that give me faith in humanity
<Midnight_Tempest> WW2... the worst war ever, there is nothing about that war that should be glorified except the people that helped all those Jews escape... they are the true heroes of the war
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Well said.
<Midnight_Tempest> aww damn... i just made myself tear up... T_T

<KetaminaDianePie> :(
<Phase4> SuperBrony64: um, not sure how you might fix it. all i can sugest is running process explorer and killing off anything you dont need running
<EmeraldChocolate> Now i do know you
<SuperBrony64> How laggy is it?
<Phase4> very
<Phase4> down to 3-8 fps
<Yahooz> fairly laggy
<Phase4> some of it might be my browser
<EmeraldChocolate> Yup.
<KetaminaDianePie> sonic is just too fast for being streamed...... deal with it

<LadyCanary> Going good SB
<KetaminaDianePie> :P
<SaxyPretender> 0,14if I had the money, I'd pick it up, but I just barely have enough for Soul Calibur V as is
<Lasharus> Yup Phase4. :P
<Phase4> this looks like an ok racing game
<Lasharus> It is quite good.
<Lasharus> Get the console version though.
<KetaminaDianePie> this works reeeeally better SB
<Lasharus> They cut support for the PC version extremely quickly.
*Phase4 played the crap out of sonic heroes
*Lasharus never really could get into Sonic Heroes.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<Fleur> dat shadow
<KetaminaDianePie> DAMN U SHADOW!
<Phase4> i managed to get A with team dark on the second last stage
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I meant to ^ what Phase4 said

<KetaminaDianePie> u damn emo..........
<otakon> WHY?!
<Phase4> the one on the giant ship in the storm
<otakon> he can RUN!
<Yahooz> becuse card games
<Lasharus> I'm with KetaminaDianePie here actually. Shadow's bloody irritating :p
<LadyCanary> mfw Im not the only one who actually enjoyed Sonic Heroes.
<Yahooz> *because
<Lasharus> And after getting amnesia the third time, you'd expect him to at least write a diary or SOMETHING.
<OneTrickPony> goodnight everypony
<Yahooz> I enjoyed it at the time
<Phase4> night OneTrickPony
<LadyCanary> Night OneTrickPony!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I liked Sonic Heroes, but I just wish all the levels weren't the same for the most part

<LadyCanary> Been a LOOONG time.
<Yahooz> later OneTrickPony
<Yahooz> IKR
<otakon> night OneTrickPony
<LadyCanary> Yaaaaay SB64!!!
<Lasharus> I didn't like Heroes too much. Possibly due to a fair number of bugs.
<Phase4> Disclaimer: sonic heroes is not a 'sonic game' persay, but rater a different kind of game with sonic in it. still a good game though
<KetaminaDianePie> Sonic Heroes.....
<otakon> A winner is Shadow?
<Lasharus> Or possibly because the triple-character gameplay didn't appeal. I dunno.
<Phase4> Lasharus: i learned to use them
<otakon> reallly?
<otakon> they used the phrase
<otakon> A WINNER IS......
*otakon facepalms
<Yahooz> allcaps
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the Sonic forums I used to go on did not take too kidnly to Sonic Heroes
<Lasharus> It's a little better than "You're Winner!" otakon. :P
<Lasharus> A little.
<Phase4> thats fair, its not what they wanted, but its a good game
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14SuperBrony64. . ?

<KetaminaDianePie> too bad sonic generation didnt work :(
<Lasharus> Can't win 'em all :(
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ahhh, pingas, the phrase that made Mike Pollack not take fan requests ever
<Yahooz> ^
<Juz16> Who wants to suggest an idea for the fanfic i'm writing?
<Juz16> XD
<Lasharus> Hardly surprising SaxyPretender.
<Lasharus> If highly regrettable, the man's brilliant as Robotnik.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep, one of the few high points of Sonic X
<Lasharus> Yup.
<Yahooz> XD
<Yahooz> Sonic X?
<Lasharus> Of course, you can see he's a bit flat in the first couple of episodes.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14too bad the rest of the 4kids crew had to come with him
<Yahooz> were talking AoStH here
<Lasharus> But unlike the other voice actors, HE grew into his role.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep
<KetaminaDianePie> huh :O?
<Juz16> lol
<Juz16> wut
<Lasharus> No Yahooz. YOU're talking AoStH. We've moved on. :P

<Juz16> 4chan
<Lasharus> The bane of existence.
<Juz16> yes
<otakon> hello again anthony
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I remember I played an early demo of Sonic 2006
<Yahooz> alot of things that start with 4 are bad words
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and was looking forward to it
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so much
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...and then...
<Lasharus> Sonic 2006's only two saving graces:
<Lasharus> Robotnik.
<otakon> SaxyPretender: the one with the real people in the cutscenes?
<Yahooz> 4kids, 4chan, 4play...
<Lasharus> And the return of the Egg Carrier.
<KetaminaDianePie> SaxyPretender :O?
<Juz16> MFW top of 4chan is pony thread
<Yahooz> the list goes on XP
<otakon> so
<anthony> LOL someone always notices when i appear in the room:D
<Randomnerd> Time for bed, godnight all.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later Randomnerd!
<anthony> goodnight
<otakon> anything with 4 in the fron is bad huh?
<otakon> night Randomnerd sleep well
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, eeyup, otakon, THAT one
<LadyCanary> Bye Randomnerd!
<otakon> SaxyPretender: good lord
<anthony> i come and go
<Randomnerd> By otakon
<KetaminaDianePie> NIIIIGHT :D!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the thing is, I think the demo I played was when the game was acutally promising
<Randomnerd> Bye, LadyCanary
<Lasharus> Highly likely.
<Lasharus> But even then it already suffered from numerous issues.
<otakon> You know what was a good Sonic game?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and then Sonic Team had to rush it...and we got THAT
<Randomnerd> Bye, SaxyPretender!
<KetaminaDianePie> never saw the demo.......
<Lasharus> Things didn't improve as development continued. :P
<otakon> Sonic Adventure
<anthony> i heard they were making a sequel
<otakon> that was a good sonic game
<Lasharus> Adventure was pretty good, aye.
<Lasharus> How could they make a sequel to 2006 anthony?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14SA2:B was the first Sonic game I owned <3
<anthony> no all stars racing
<Lasharus> To my knowledge, the ending basically goes "and it all never happened. The end."
<Lasharus> Oh, I like that.
<KetaminaDianePie> best thing of Adventure were Chaos............. and i LOVE Sonic
<Lasharus> More racing as Robotnik.
<Yahooz> &
<SaxyPretender> 0,14mainly because I grew up without a Sega system as a kid
<Yahooz> *^
<Yahooz> Segaaaaa
<Lasharus> You poor thing SaxyPretender :(
*Lasharus hugs SaxyPretender
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but I knew people who had them and I liked the Sonic series growing up
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I even had Sonic Bubble Bath!
<KetaminaDianePie> :O
<anthony> strange thing that i want a nes and got a sega genesis lol
<Yahooz> I grew up with a PS2. Twas nice
<otakon> I grew up with a NES
<otakon> good times
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so I was a Sonic fan, but had never played the games until SA2:B
*otakon weeps for his lost NES
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...needless to say, it was a good first impression
<Yahooz> Daw
<LadyCanary> I never had a game console until I got my PS2
<Lasharus> Adventure 2 is probably the primary reason for my Robotnik-fanboyism. :P
<KetaminaDianePie> i grew up with PC..... btw on consoles i always stick to Sonic
<anthony> i still have my originally ps2. the fan is really loud though. sounds like a jet in my room lol
<Yahooz> AoStH Robotnik > ALL robotniks
<otakon> anthony: keep it safe
<Lasharus> Would you leave it Yahooz? :P
<otakon> AoStH?
<Yahooz> no
<KetaminaDianePie> i sold my PS2 for a GameCube :D!
<Lasharus> Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog otakon.
<Lasharus> Cartoon.
<otakon> Lasharus: oh god what
<otakon> no
<Lasharus> There were several.
<otakon> SatAM Robotnik ftw
<Lasharus> SatAM was the darkest of the cartoons, probably.
<otakon> That was a REAL villain!
<Lasharus> Sonic X is the worst.
<Lasharus> And AoStH is the most insane.
<otakon> my god, I should see if I can find that show again
<otakon> AoStH is insanity on a stick
<Lasharus> otakon, I have the full series on my harddrive.
<anthony> sonic x...*shivers* o_o
<otakon> Lasharus: you lucky bugger
<Yahooz> There are downloads...
<Lasharus> Eh, very low resolution.
<Yahooz> trye
<otakon> the only thing that I thought was fairly good about X
<Yahooz> *true
<Lasharus> Mike Pollock.
<otakon> was the intro
<otakon> i like it
<Lasharus> No no, Mike Pollock.
<Yahooz> naw
<anthony> yea
<Yahooz> X just... didnt cut it as a whole
<Phase4> this course is awesome in sonic heroes
<KetaminaDianePie> ow SB's back :)
<Lasharus> It got Mike Pollock as Robotnik's VA. I'm willing to give it that much credit Yahooz.
<anthony> god i hated this level
<anthony> damn pinball of death

<Lasharus> SaxyPretender, say that favourite character thing again, paying attention to every word, would you?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...I know what I said =P

<otakon> 20 new
<Lasharus> Shadow's a boring one-dimensional angsty triple amnesiac for god's sake!
<LadyCanary> HNNNNG my baby ;^;
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Well, he was interesting in SA2
<Ingwaz> dont you mean sasuke from naruto Lasharus?
<Lasharus> Yup.
<Lasharus> And if he stayed dead, I would've been happy.
<otakon> or Vincent from FF7?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I would've been okay with that too
<KetaminaDianePie> SB?
<otakon> or Fenris for Dragon Age 2?
<Ingwaz> vincent had style though
<SuperBrony64> Hai :3
<Lasharus> No, none of them are triple amnesiacs.
<Lasharus> Try to keep up.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I don't mind Shadow (pardon the pun) archetypes for characters
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Spider-Man has Venom
<SaxyPretender> 0,14for example
<otakon> Lasharus: Fenris was a amniesiac
<Lasharus> Triple?
<otakon> hell, CLOUD counts too!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but you don't see Venom fighting Spidey EVERY issue
<KetaminaDianePie> OOOOWW YEEEAH!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Shadow should be used the same way
<KetaminaDianePie> BEST
<Lasharus> Because Shadow was an amnesiac at the start of SA2, at the start of Heroes, AND at the start of his own trainwreck. Sorry, game.
<otakon> Lasharus: how can you lose your memories three times?
<KetaminaDianePie> OST
<KetaminaDianePie> EVER!
<Lasharus> I don't know otakon. Ask bloody Shadow.
<KetaminaDianePie> noooo
<Lasharus> He did it
<otakon> Lasharus: they aren't in order
<Shizuka> 13why does he need a vehicle..
<otakon> Shizuka: I just asked that
<Lasharus> No otakon, they're all out of order. In every sense of the phrase.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Because bikes are edgy and cool
<otakon> Lasharus: agreed
<LadyCanary> For the ANGST.
<Wrek|Observing> 05Gentlecolts!
<otakon> I tried to play Shadow the Hedgehog
<Wrek|Observing> 05may i make a suggestion?
<otakon> I was horrible
<Lasharus> Go for it.
<Wrek|Observing> 05Slap my plot.
<Lasharus> ...wot.
<otakon> I knew it
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<LadyCanary> Do tell Wrek. Wait what.
<LadyCanary> ...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14NOT IT
*LadyCanary refuses.
<otakon> I KNEW he was gonna do that
<otakon> NOT It!
*Lasharus backs out.
*KetaminaDianePie dances hard to this music
<Wrek|Observing> 05*snort snort*
<Lasharus> And back to the Sonic conversation.
<Lasharus> Where was I?
<anthony> i bought shadow the hedgehog for 5 bucks at eb games
<Shizuka> 13that thing handles like a greased pig...
<otakon> where's Saturn when you need him?
<Lasharus> Oh yes, Robotnik is awesome.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14he is
<Shizuka> 13a stick of butter has better traction
<LadyCanary> Because hes riding that hog.
<otakon> Shizuka: Shadow handles like a greased pig
<Lasharus> I prefer racing as Robotnik in this game Shizuka. :P
<Lasharus> He might not accellerate fast, but by god does he race. :p
<Wrek|Observing> 05im dissapointed :|
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but yeah, I was looking forward to Shadow the Hedgehog
<otakon> anyone here play the Dark Brotherhood RPG on the DS?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14played through it, and was like ehhhhh
<otakon> it was pretty good actually
<Lasharus> Yes otakon.
<KetaminaDianePie> tooo bad it was shadow
<Lasharus> It was pretty good, but it had one drawback.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I enjoyed certain aspects like the music
<Lasharus> The earpiercing MUSIC.
<anthony> meh i couldnt get into it
<otakon> yeah
<Lasharus> Who the hell was responsible for that atrocious score?
<otakon> the tunes were not the usually sonic goodness
<Lasharus> 8-bit games do better.
<LadyCanary> That would be SuperBrony64 dear Lasharus.
<otakon> I don't know why
<Lasharus> SuperBrony64, do i have permission to link two youtube videos?
<anthony> yea played it on mute
<otakon> Sonic games seem to ALWAYS have good music
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that is true
<anthony> and great cgi
<Lasharus> I was talking about the musical score in the Dark Brotherhood game LadyCanary. :p
<Ingwaz> mega man games have better music
<LadyCanary> Pardon me ^^"
<otakon> anthony: but that's only true recently
<Wrek|Observing> 05as for game music
<otakon> Ingwaz: correct
<anthony> true
<Wrek|Observing> 05Unreal tournament alwasy impressed me
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I used to have a theory that after SA2:B, the better the music the worse the reception
<otakon> really?
<SuperBrony64> Yes, you can post YouTube links
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Sonic Heroes = okay music, okay-ish game
<KetaminaDianePie> Unreal Tournament..................
<KetaminaDianePie> FTW NYEEEEEAH!
<Lasharus> Just for amusement purposes then.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Sonic 2006, great music, TERRIBLE game
<otakon> SaxyPretender: sounds about right, Sonic COLORS had GREAT music. Was not well recieved
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it was
<SaxyPretender> 0,14very much so
<otakon> really?
<otakon> you sure?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep
<Lasharus> THIS is the music from Sonic: The Dark Brotherhood in Central City (you may want to close the vid fast)
<Lasharus> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o47N-aYd08&feature=related
<LadyCanary> Favorite song in SA2:B was Escape from the City, or whatever it was called.
<PartyCannon> But Sonic Generations has great music and gameplay :)
<otakon> dear god
<Lasharus> THIS is from Sonic 3D, the original version:
<Lasharus> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mf7-ixllcgo
<otakon> MY EARS!
<Lasharus> Check the original version.
<otakon> gods almight I forgot how bad it sounded!
<Lasharus> So a game that was about 8-10 years older did about 50 times better.
<Lasharus> That's kinda sad.
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> it is
<KetaminaDianePie> Sonic 3D..............
<anthony> ouch :'(
<otakon> the original sounds SO GOOD
<Lasharus> Might not have been a brilliant game, but the music was fantastic :P
<KetaminaDianePie> my first sonic delusion...................
<otakon> I'll be honest
<Lasharus> Seriously, 3D had a sublime OST.
<otakon> I like alot of the vocal themes done recently
<KetaminaDianePie> dunno Lasharus........
<KetaminaDianePie> i cant stand sonic 3d
<Lasharus> Incidentally, my apologies for causing eardrum damage with my first video.
*SaxyPretender just remembered his old username on his previous internet home which was a Sonic forum
<LadyCanary> Well, Im off to bed, everyone. Have a good day/night and love you all. <3 Thanks for streaming SB!

<SaxyPretender> 0,14...no idea

<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Sonic CD <3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I got it from one of my favorite Foo Fighters song
<Lasharus> I... was planning on linking the final boss theme of that now KetaminaDianePie. :p

<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Sonic boom
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14SONIC BOOOM
<Lasharus> (though I feel some are worse)
<Shizuka> 13rainboom?

<KetaminaDianePie> Sonic Boom is the BEST Sonic song.....
<anthony> i like the gameover music lolz
<KetaminaDianePie> obviously

<Lasharus> On my screen, at least :(
<anthony> WRONG

<Shizuka> 13RIGHT
<otakon> DerpyHooves`: are you ignoring my question dear?
<Lasharus> Oh you hush, it's referring to the same thing Violet. :p

<KetaminaDianePie> blazblue is good
<otakon> plus, I SUCK at fighting games
<Ingwaz> for him to lose to me is a big loss
<SaxyPretender> 0,14What was the matchup?
<otakon> Ingwaz: bad day for him?
<Ingwaz> he drops a skill level and when you're that high up, the skill levels are hard to get
<otakon> it happnes
<otakon> like how you miss a 29 YARD FIELD GOAL!
<Ingwaz> no, he was good, he really was, he beat me the first time we fought, and i beat him the second, first time though i did give him a run for his money
<otakon> ARGH! how the HELL did he miss that damn field goal!
<Ingwaz> and it was hazama vs bang SaxyPretender, i play hazama

<Ingwaz> making it easier to get his furikazan
<Dumori> maybe get some time in as com
<otakon> SaxyPretender: I have played for hours before, just on STREET FIGHTER ALPHA 3! I cannot get that stuff down.
<Shizuka> 13but for food... chicken noodle soup ist the king of soups for when you are ill
<otakon> yes
<Dumori> ^
<Dumori> but we don't have anny
<otakon> damn, now I'm hungry
<Ingwaz> hakumen, and mu-13 are getting buffed to insanity though...both are possible a tier now
<Dumori> and I'm too ill to buy any
<otakon> Dumori: well, hot clear broth will work in a pinch
<Shizuka> 13in close second is chicken und rice with some crackers crumbled up to lessen the sodium a little
<Ingwaz> tager is getting a ridiculous buff for extend as well
<otakon> do you have a boullion cubes Dumori?
<Fleur> is the stream paused or something?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh yeah, I saw the day 1 tier list for Tager
<Shizuka> 13und in third ramen, just for the broth
<otakon> yeah Fleur
<Dumori> I have stuff
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I was like Tager for B?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14No wai
<otakon> I don't know where SB went again
<Dumori> I have about 1000 diffrent soups
<Ingwaz> its ridiculous, you take the charcter whos a throw character, and buff his combos and damage like crazy
<Dumori> they are my main food
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and then my friend who mains Tager sent me his combos
<Fleur> oh ok. I was thinking my end was fucked up
<Ingwaz> and hes potentially a tier, not just b tier
<otakon> Dumori: remember, clear broth is best when your sick.
<otakon> nothing thick
<Dumori> I knok
<Dumori> know
<otakon> you knok?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it is possible to make a grapple charcter goos
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*good
<Shizuka> 13knokc knock
<Ingwaz> potemkin
<SaxyPretender> 0,14like Potemkin
<Dumori> but when one gets dehydrated as you can't hold down water
*Fleur just remembered that she hasent eaten in two days
<otakon> I don't know why your knocking....
<Dumori> soup is a no
<otakon> Dumori: well, just keep hydrating
<otakon> that's all you can do
<Shizuka> 13so much not eating... we must hold a bronystate feast tomorrow
<Ingwaz> i have no problem with tager being balanced, but as he is inextend....thats not ballanced
<KetaminaDianePie> stream please..............................................
<Shizuka> 13to celebrate.... um.... thursday?
<Ingwaz> the only winning option against tager now is to run like crazy
<Ingwaz> before you could at least tangle with him if you played it smart
<Dumori> I'm better now then I was yesterday
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Bang has it kinda easy in that regard
*Fleur doesnt like it when she doesnt eat ;___;
<otakon> Shizuka: I have news! I'm makeing bread tomorrow! I shall take pictures!
<Dumori> I ate a samwitch
<Dumori> and every thing
<Shizuka> 13huzzah
<Dumori> but the last two days where crappy
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Poison nail, bumpers/FRKZ and run away all day
<otakon> it will probably be horrible though
*Fleur will try to go eat something
<Ingwaz> hazama can run all day, but i dont like to do that, seems, unsportsmanlike
<otakon> Fleur: you do that
<SaxyPretender> 0,14same
<Dumori> I could make bread today
*Fleur hopes her appitite will allow her to
<SaxyPretender> 0,14especially because the Hazama/Tager is soooooooooooooo dumb
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Mike Z hates it
<Dumori> we have a fuckton of yeast and flour
<SaxyPretender> 0,14with a burning passion
<otakon> I have NO idea what your talking about SaxyPretender
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Tager is a grapple character like Zangief
<Fleur> ^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14he needs to get in very close to do damage
<Ingwaz> lol, fought some poor tager player as well, he'd only played like 30 matches and was level 22 so i thought he might be good, he was terrible
<SaxyPretender> 0,14he has little options to do so
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Hazama is VERY good at fighting from a distance
<Ingwaz> not really sax, hazama's sweet spot is up close as well
*Fleur fights best with Jen and the police woman
<Ingwaz> hes got good zoning at a long range, but not damage
<SaxyPretender> 0,14true
<Fleur> the police woman who looks like Bridget
<Ingwaz> hazama doesnt have any options at mid range at all, his chains dont stun enough and his moves dont reach far enough
<SaxyPretender> 0,14in any case, the Hazama/Tager matchup is in hazama's favor
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, the police woman is Noel Vermillion
<Fleur> her!
<Ingwaz> if hazama chooses to play it smart, yeah, hes got a serious advantage
<Fleur> thank you saxy
<SaxyPretender> 0,14np
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<KetaminaDianePie> NOEL VERMILION..............
*Fleur keeps the combo going as Noel
<KetaminaDianePie> damn i hate that bvitch
<bluestrom_S> I'm off to bed
<bluestrom_S> good night everyone
<Fleur> no breathing room whatsoever is how I play her
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's been a while since I kept up with BB knowledge
<Fleur> night bluestrom_S
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later bluestrom_S
<Ingwaz> oh sax, you'll like this, was playing a guy a long time ago, the type of guy who plays as tager and sets the timer for 30 seconds so he only has to hit you then wait you out (thats what he actually did)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<Dumorimasoddaa> Any pony here play nuclear dawn?
<Ingwaz> started using hazama to my advantage when i realized what he was doing, he got pissed and switched to beginner mode unlimited mu-12
<Fleur> not I Dumorimasoddaa
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14SCRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUB
<Ingwaz> i switch to lambda, regular and not beginner who rarely use at all, and just unload on him
<Ingwaz> killed him in 22 seconds and he didnt even touch me
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Ingwaz /)
<Ingwaz> it was glorious
<Ingwaz> (\
<SuperBrony64> Alright, going back to stream
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I may not be good myself, but if I lose, I take it and try not to get salty
<otakon> finally
<Ingwaz> i have no problem losing provided the player is legitimately skilled
<KetaminaDianePie> GOGOGOGO SB :D!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14same
<Ingwaz> the stronger my opponents the better i become
<otakon> SuperBrony64: what the hay was that all about?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I was on a 27 win streak in MvC3 the other day
<otakon> argh
<Ingwaz> god, i havent played mvc3 in ages
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and someone using Wolverine, Akuma and chun-Li beat me
<otakon> WHy do I suck at fighting games so much?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and while they were using top tier guys
<Ingwaz> wow....sounds like potential for scrubbiness
<SaxyPretender> 0,14they played them very well
<otakon> actually
<KetaminaDianePie> btw...... ;PPPPPPPPPPPPP SHADOW!
<Phase4> i'm off for a bit, got stuff to do and this site is VERY distracting. later
<Skipper> sonic sez
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later Phase4!
<otakon> I have a event that happened that perplexed my
<otakon> see ya later Phase4
<Lasharus> Laters Phase4.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14He knew to punish my stuff and played it safe with his dive kicks
<KetaminaDianePie> ALEX KID!
<otakon> My friend, who is a girl beat ALL of us at Street Fighter 2 HD Turbo with Chun Li
<Ingwaz> i got tired of mvc3 pretty quick, i liked to play my brother and his friend, apparently their idea of a winning strategy is to pick mostly blaster characters or beef tanks like sentinel before he was nerfed and just blast all day
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14people still do that
<otakon> ah the old keep away strategy
<otakon> like Cable!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14just yesterday, I was fighting some guy
<Ingwaz> my brother got a bit more skill, mostly relying heavily on wesker and his ridiculous pressure
<SaxyPretender> 0,14using Hulk, Sent and Dormammu
<SaxyPretender> 0,14his entire Sent stategy was NEUTRAKLIZE, NEUTRALIZE
<Ingwaz> yep...
<Shizuka> 13daleks?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and while my Hulk can't punish it that well
<SaxyPretender> 0,14my Tasky can :3
<KetaminaDianePie> Ingwaz.... u r a noob....... the best blast team is obviously Morgan, Akuma nand Deadpool :D!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so while he was spitting up plasma
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I just jumped and shot arrows
<KetaminaDianePie> *and
<Ingwaz> lol, reminds me of another one, dont remember my whole team but fighting my brother, i've lost at elast one and zero comes out...hes got sentinel, he has the brilliance to say i have no chance, before i use zeros obscene speed to cross him up in to oblivion
<SaxyPretender> 0,14if he wants to play keepaway, I can too
<Ingwaz> i hate playing keep away
<Ingwaz> probably too aggressive on my part but imo, its a fighting game, keep away isnt fighting
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so do I, but if it gets me the win in the end, or if they start it
<Ingwaz> if they start it, i'm more okay with it, but still not a fan
<SaxyPretender> 0,14same
<Ingwaz> same reason why i dont play ssf4 anymore, kept running in to e-hondas who would only do that launch across the screen attack
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ahh, SSF4
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I don't play that online
<KetaminaDianePie> <3 Ulala :)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14heck, I don't even play it
<otakon> Ingwaz: what? no M.Bison Slide Knee or Psycho Crusher?
*Fleur doesnt play many fighting games because her brothers are not too good at them and she always feels like a dick for destroying them
<KetaminaDianePie> Ulaaaalaaaa!
<Ingwaz> seriously otakon, i ran in to a few of theses guys, and all they would do is launch themselves across the screen
<KetaminaDianePie> Back in Black :D!
<Ingwaz> over and over and over, the speed at which e-honda moves is hard to counter
*Fleur feels like a bigger dick when she holds back
<otakon> Ingwaz: I can feel ya on that
<Ingwaz> with that one attack i mean
<otakon> I never win so it doesn't matter
<otakon> never
<KetaminaDianePie> nooo wait sory.....
<Shizuka> 13was ist going on in this thread
<KetaminaDianePie> Wrapped in Black!
<otakon> hell, I remember Soul Calibur 4

<SuperBrony64> Hai BAD_CHATTER
<Fleur> please change your name
<Lasharus> Could I just quote back to you him calling an op a scumbag?
<Lasharus> I think that that constitutes breaking a rule.
*SuperBrony64 hugs BAD_CHATTER
<DJMidgetBrony> Meh
<Lasharus> And idiocy.
<Lasharus> Definitely idiocy. :)
<Tovler> Wow, what a badass

<Fleur> no you listen
<BAD_CHATTER> you can't tolerate my nick
<KetaminaDianePie> ... go!
<SuperBrony64> I'm giving you one last warning
<BAD_CHATTER> im trying to tolerate
<BAD_CHATTER> you just want to ban for no reason
<SuperBrony64> Change your nick to lower case
<DJMidgetBrony> Well
<SuperBrony64> That's all I'm asking right now
<otakon> BAD_CHATTER: it's not that, it is a rule of the room here to go easy on allcaps
<DJMidgetBrony> for one Your yelling your name across the network
<BAD_CHATTER> its going against everything you are for
<Dr_Fumbles> this really shouldnt be that big of a problem, at least for now
<DJMidgetBrony> 2 You just called out an IRCop
<Fleur> BAD_CHATTER: going against an order from an OP is grounds for a ban
<BAD_CHATTER> none of my chats are in allcaps though
<otakon> your nick is allcaps
<Lasharus> Your nickname breaks the all caps rule BAD_CHATTER. That is all. You decided to troll as opposed to changing it. Ergo, I've little compunction in being sarcastic.
<BAD_CHATTER> if an op told you to jump off a cliff would you do it?
<Fleur> please change your name
<SuperBrony64> Please everypony, let me deal with him
<Lasharus> Okay, I'll shut it. :p
<otakon> odl

<SuperBrony64> BAD_CHATTER: Just change your name please, thats all I want
<BAD_CHATTER> why can't you tolerate my nickname
<SuperBrony64> Its fine, just needs to be lowercase
<Lasharus> Yeah, sorry. I can never resist responding in these situations. It's a bad habit of mine that I should break.

<Dashie_Dashie> Mooooooosica.
<KetaminaDianePie> O:
<Kammerjunk> Moo.
<KetaminaDianePie> :((((((((((((
<KetaminaDianePie> no new sonic generations DLC..........
<KetaminaDianePie> TT^TT
<Dashie_Dashie> blah.. figures the time I want to draw I have no music playlists on youtube ._.
<Kammerjunk> The lunatic is in my head. The lunatics are in my head. You raise the blade, you make the change. You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane.
<Kammerjunk> You lock the door and throw away the key. There's someone in my head, but it's not me.
<KetaminaDianePie> whoooaaaaa
<Kammerjunk> Pipsqueak story?
<Kammerjunk> Okay.
<Dashie_Dashie> Guize, I need some assistance with this oc, it's about the mane.
<Dashie_Dashie> gimmeh a sec and I'll show you
<Kammerjunk> I'm not sure if there's anyone else here besides you, KetaminaDianePie and me.
<HeavyMetalDash> I'm still here
<KetaminaDianePie> im here.... almost.....
<Kammerjunk> Ah.
<Dashie_Dashie> ok so..
<Dashie_Dashie> yes or no on the bangs of this Mane
<Dashie_Dashie> http://i.imgur.com/b2rLe.png
<Kammerjunk> >Fashion
<Kammerjunk> Not my division.
<KetaminaDianePie> im gonna playing some sonic generations since SuperBrony64|Zzz deluded me........
<Dashie_Dashie> @_@
<Kammerjunk> Still, I think I prefer the bangs.
<Dashie_Dashie> ok I see.
<Dashie_Dashie> back to ze verk
<HeavyMetalDash> I say bangs
<Dashie_Dashie> ok HMD =p
<Dashie_Dashie> bangs stay
<HeavyMetalDash> XD
<Kammerjunk> I don't know why, but I like black mixed with colours like green.
<KetaminaDianePie> i love black and green :D!
<Dashie_Dashie> Skrillex - Bangarang = best drawing mood ever
<HeavyMetalDash> It's an appealing style choice for various reasons
<broniesnl> sorry for interupting, but is the steam offline again now?
<Dashie_Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR2XilcGYOo&ob=av2e
<Dashie_Dashie> XD
<Dashie_Dashie> This is my drawing music lol
<KetaminaDianePie> heres mine pony http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn73/stanzadifabio/myPony.png
<Kammerjunk> I haven't made an OC pony.
<Kammerjunk> I don't know what I'd use it for.
<HeavyMetalDash> unicorn
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm using MS Paint for mine.
<Kammerjunk> Besides, I can't draw ponies for my life.
<KetaminaDianePie> just use the pony creator! its THAT easy :D!
<HeavyMetalDash> I'm still deciding wheather or not too make mine Unicorn or Pegasus
<Dashie_Dashie> Lol, that OC cartoon pony was from the Ponycreator on Deviant
<Dashie_Dashie> using that as a basis for a hand drawn OC
<Kammerjunk> And then, I wouldn't know what to do with it.
<Dashie_Dashie> Pegasi ftw <3
<KetaminaDianePie> who cares! just do it!
<Dashie_Dashie> alicorns are overrated xD
<Kammerjunk> HeavyMetalDash: Despite never planning to make an OC pony, I've pondered that question myself for a very long time, weighing out the pro's and con's of both races.
<Kammerjunk> And I came to the conclusion that while it would be great being able to perform magic, it doesn
<Dashie_Dashie> Only problem I'm coming across is a name for me as an OC pony, and my cutie mark.
<HeavyMetalDash> I have a concept sketch of him as a pegasus but I think I'm leaning towards unicorn for the function of his special talent
<Dashie_Dashie> all big problems ._.
<Kammerjunk> ...it doesn't give you the ability to soar through the skies majestically.
<Kammerjunk> Like an eagle.
<Kammerjunk> Piloting a blimp.
<HeavyMetalDash> but does an artist require such a skill?
<Kammerjunk> No, and in the end, I figured that while it would be fun, certainly, it doesn't quite fit me.
<Phase4> hello again
<HeavyMetalDash> Also I'm having a hard time drawing ...well...cute
<Kammerjunk> I am absolutely obsessed with reading, and it kind of contradicts what being a pegasus allows you to do.
<Phase4> ?????
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Phase4.
<KetaminaDianePie> :O!
<Kammerjunk> I was just overthinking stuff again.
<KetaminaDianePie> yes
<Kammerjunk> Because if there's one thing I like to do asides from read, it's overthink stuff.
<KetaminaDianePie> you do
<HeavyMetalDash> dat Phase4
<Phase4> reading and overthinking, the hobby's of any true nerd
<Phase4> may i join in?
<HeavyMetalDash> Most certainly
<KetaminaDianePie> i wonder how are you with games with character customisation..............
<Kammerjunk> KetaminaDianePie: I spent just about an hour in Skyrim.
<Kammerjunk> Could be longer.
<KetaminaDianePie> ......
<KetaminaDianePie> you remind me of my best friend..........
<Dashie_Dashie> Great song to draw too.
<Dashie_Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s4n76ti3Xs
<Kammerjunk> I was still not quite satisfied with the nose, but it would have to do.
<KetaminaDianePie> btw unicorns are better.......
<KetaminaDianePie> just try to think how would be to play videogames as a pony
<Kammerjunk> KetaminaDianePie: It depends on what you like to do.
<Kammerjunk> I know a few sports fans, for example.
<KetaminaDianePie> welll
<KetaminaDianePie> i fckn LOVE VIDEOGAMES!
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<KetaminaDianePie> and computers
<Kammerjunk> Exactly.
<Dashie_Dashie> I wish I could stream for you guys to keep you entertained @_@
<KetaminaDianePie> and making electronic music.....
<Dashie_Dashie> I'd draw, you'd listen to music and watch me draw lol.
<KetaminaDianePie> pegasus cant do that.....
<Kammerjunk> I would have a hard time being satisfied with being a pegasus.
<HeavyMetalDash> I think I'll make more than on OC and then write a fic
<HeavyMetalDash> problem solved
<KetaminaDianePie> :D!
<KetaminaDianePie> btw.....
<KetaminaDianePie> cant unicorns fly with magic?
<Kammerjunk> I've started writing about a dozen fics (Yay! I got to use 'dozen'!), but I've never actually finished one.
<Kammerjunk> KetaminaDianePie: Yes, but it requires an immense amount of magic, as demonstrated in episode 15.
<Kammerjunk> 16*
<KetaminaDianePie> bah......
<KetaminaDianePie> u saw last episodes with the pie family?
<Kammerjunk> Last Roundup?
<KetaminaDianePie> nope
<HeavyMetalDash> uh well I think that can actually be explained
<Kammerjunk> Family Appreciation Day?
<KetaminaDianePie> hmmmmmmmmmmm
<Kammerjunk> With the zapapples?
<KetaminaDianePie> Baby Cakes!
<Kammerjunk> Ah.
<Kammerjunk> With Pinkie and the Cakes.
<HeavyMetalDash> as was stated Baby Unicorns are prone to burst of magic. That doesn't mean that the baby was tapping into it's own reserves it was most likely just getting it's powers in short concentrated bursts
<Kammerjunk> But that was explained, though.
<Kammerjunk> Yes, exactly.
<Kammerjunk> I like the idea of ley lines running under Equestria.
<KetaminaDianePie> my god ur sooooo nerdy :D!
<HeavyMetalDash> indeed
<KetaminaDianePie> no offense of course :)
<Kammerjunk> And as for the pegasus, it was just better than Scootaloo.
<KetaminaDianePie> :(
<KetaminaDianePie> poor scootalooo
<KetaminaDianePie> SCOOOTALOOOOO!!!!!
<Kammerjunk> wat
<HeavyMetalDash> none taken I enjoy my nerdness
<KetaminaDianePie> (im quoting myself)
<HeavyMetalDash> I feel all twilight sparkley
<Phase4> confound that real life
<Kammerjunk> Twilight is my favourite pony.
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: That old MMO?
<Phase4> yeah, its full of bugs
<KetaminaDianePie> wut?
<KetaminaDianePie> wut MMO?
<Kammerjunk> I have no idea why that God company decided to give players the ability to change the game.
<Kammerjunk> See where that led it.
<HeavyMetalDash> I'm...lost
<KetaminaDianePie> yeah me tooo
<Kammerjunk> You know, that old MMORPG made titled "Real Life".
<Phase4> and the pricing, dont get me started on the pricing
<HeavyMetalDash> nope not that hardcore of a gamer
<KetaminaDianePie> never heard bout that
<Kammerjunk> Oh, Goddesses.
<KetaminaDianePie> Goddess?
<KetaminaDianePie> Like Elune?
<Kammerjunk> It's also a pain that you can only make one character, and when this character dies, it's game over.
<KetaminaDianePie> Pere Lune!
<Kammerjunk> KetaminaDianePie: No, like Celestia and Luna.
<Kammerjunk> But yeah, Elune is cool too.
<Dashie_Dashie> what do you guys think so far?
<Dashie_Dashie> http://i.imgur.com/brA0G.png
<KetaminaDianePie> hmmmmmmmmmm
<KetaminaDianePie> its the same pose as the pony creator.......
<Dashie_Dashie> well I planned on making more poses >.>
<Kammerjunk> KetaminaDianePie: You can pose in the pony creator.
<KetaminaDianePie> but GOGOGO!
<KetaminaDianePie> i know u silly
<Dashie_Dashie> @_@
<HeavyMetalDash> I like it!
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, me too.
<BewareOfRabbit> is anything playing?
<Kammerjunk> I just wish I could get the Luna-damned neck right when I try drawing ponies.
<KetaminaDianePie> nope
<Kammerjunk> BewareOfRabbit: Nope, but avÃª anyway.
<BewareOfRabbit> code lyoko was on lastnight
<BewareOfRabbit> or day
<Kammerjunk> ...I seriously need a keyboard with support for Latin accents.
<BewareOfRabbit> depending on your location
<Dashie_Dashie> well.. I could change the pose from where I am in progress.
<Dashie_Dashie> give me a few~
<Dashie_Dashie> one minor update to it :p

<Phase4> not more than any other two colours no
<KetaminaDianePie> :(
<KetaminaDianePie> wuts your favourite color?
<nido> http://www.kareno.org/js/colors/ <-- here's a random colour generator
<KetaminaDianePie> NO nido!
<KetaminaDianePie> It cant be done this way!

<nido> one could use it to generate a number of colours, and decide which fit best together with eachother and the person being ponified
<KetaminaDianePie> btw that app is fun :D
<Phase4> distracted by life again
<KetaminaDianePie> any colour yet Phase4?

<ScootaChicken> J'habite Ã  Mill Hill, dans la banlieue nord ouest de Londres. Nous avons une grande maison. Il y a trois chambres et un grand salon. Il ya un petit jardin aussi. Dans mon quartier il y a beaucoup de maisons, beaucoup de magasins et des restaurants et des cafÃ©s. Dans mon quartier on peut visiter le parc, au peut aller au cinÃ©ma et on peut aller Ã  la piscine. En Ã©tÃ© il fait assez chaud, mais il pleut parfois, que je n'aime pas.

<Starflash> anyways, Sounds good Scoots
<nido> ce ne c'est pas "I hate aussi"
<Starflash> Je dÃ©teste aussi.
<Phase4> "I live in Mill Hill, a suburb northwest of London. We have a large house. There are three bedrooms and a large living room. There is also a small garden. In my neighborhood there are many houses, many shops and restaurants and cafes. In my neighborhood you can visit the park, can go to the movies and you can go swimming. In summer it is warm enough, but sometimes it rains, I do not like" is wat google translate told me

<Dashie_Dashie> http://i.imgur.com/pi0ej.png
<Phase4> ScootaChicken: i could upload it to dropbox if you want

<ScootaChicken> don't worry Phase4 I've already seen your OC
<KetaminaDianePie> yaaaay Dashie_Dashie!
<ScootaChicken> its looking good
<KetaminaDianePie> GOGOGO!

<Phase4> ScootaChicken: i ment the pony creator, if you want to use it
<ScootaChicken> oh right
<ScootaChicken> nah its fine
*Phase4 has zero ability to draw
<ScootaChicken> my ability to draw is... lacking to say the least
<KetaminaDianePie> im quite good at draw...........
<ScootaChicken> Nyria, if you can access my deviantart you could link a few of my masterpieces into this chat
<KetaminaDianePie> but im soooo fckn LAAAAZY!

<Dashie_Dashie> Drawing to this = epic win
<Dashie_Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5YfYtZ32d4
<ScootaChicken> I love how the Iris chat doesn't have any giant images of ponies emblazoned everywhere
<ScootaChicken> it makes using this at school so much easier
<Phase4> :):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):) << this chat has a serious lack of little twilight faces, fixing
<Starflash> Lol ScootaChicken. Shouldn't you be learning somethin right now.
<Starflash> :$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$:$
<KetaminaDianePie> owww right lets troll the neighbourgs with some pony music
<ScootaChicken> eenope Starflash.
<ScootaChicken> its meant to be PE but I injured myself
<Starflash> OH ok. o_O
<Phase4> i would do shy but we only have sadshy and rageshy
<ScootaChicken> so I can just fuck around on the computers for however long I want to
<ScootaChicken> well, until lunch
<Phase4> ScootaChicken: silly, chickens cant do pe
<ScootaChicken> us chickens are awesome at PE
<Starflash> OF course they can. They do so much running that they keep on goin when they die.
<ScootaChicken> our long jump abilities are unrivaled
<Phase4> have you ever seen a chicken run? we had one here for a while and the dog chased it around for a bit
<Phase4> poor thing was scared shitless but it looked so funny
<ScootaChicken> somewhat related, Chicken Run is a great film
<Phase4> ^
<ScootaChicken> we should watch it here sometime
<Phase4> have that on vhs
<nido> yay! vhs
<ScootaChicken> same Phase4
<ScootaChicken> I love VHS
<ScootaChicken> except that one time when I got that really creepy tape 6 days ago that said I would die in 7 days
<Phase4> meh, bluray's are better
<ScootaChicken> eh, probably just a prank or something
<Phase4> probably
<ScootaChicken> brb, there's a girl coming towards me out of my computer screen
<Phase4> have fun
<nido> i heard of that one ScootaChicken. Make sure you tape yourself, those deaths tend to be really violent and off-the-map weird
<KetaminaDianePie> :O?
<ScootaChicken> eh, I gave it to someone I don't like
<KetaminaDianePie> ScootaChicken NOOOOOO!!!!!
<ScootaChicken> also, of all the things deviantart could be banned for, the reason our provider chooses to censor it is 'web chat'
<KetaminaDianePie> hahahahaahahaha
<nido> ScootaChicken: what kind of provider is that?
<ScootaChicken> nido, London Grid for Learning URL filtering
<nido> also, DA has "web chat"?
<Phase4> had to tiolet, did i miss much?
<ScootaChicken> its what our school uses
<Phase4> toilet'
<Phase4> nido: the comments probably count
<Phase4> its a shitty filter if its letting this through
<ScootaChicken> it really is
<ScootaChicken> plus until about a couple weeks ago there was a really easy workaround
<nido> Phase4: url filtering generally only works over port 80
<Phase4> thats why its shitty
<Phase4> change your dns and BAM, problem solved
<nido> not necesarily
<Phase4> my tafe had the "right" kind of filter wich was a cacheing proxy betwene the internal network and the internet
<nido> I've seen a lot of those filtering 'proxies' just hijaching any traffic on port 80, and filtering the GET comments
<ScootaChicken> off to lunch guys
<ScootaChicken> bye
<Phase4> caching'
<Phase4> later ScootaChicken
<nido> commands
<Phase4> i was just wondering about eqd
*MakerDusk yawns his way back into existance
<Phase4> nido: never seen a transparent filter here, only been on two filtered networks though
<Phase4> ohai MakerDusk
<KetaminaDianePie> cya ScootaChicken!
<MakerDusk> heya Phase4
<MakerDusk> today will not be kind to me
<MakerDusk> way too tired
<Ninjapony> Hi everyone
<Phase4> ah, hate those days
<Phase4> hi Ninjapony
<MakerDusk> hello Ninjapony
*Ninjapony waves at Phase4 and MakerDusk
<MakerDusk> I hope this tea revives me
<Phase4> hmm, i head a ding but my chat is dead
<Phase4> brb
<MakerDusk> was too tired to fill sugar, so I just put maple syrup in it
<Starflash> Ohai Ninjapony~
<Phase4> my chat died, what was that message i missed?
*Starflash is half busy playing some games.
<nido> Phase4: I've seen a lot of them. But transparent filters usually tend to be... transparent
*Ninjapony waves at Starflash and Phase4 again
<Ninjapony> I was just waving at you ^^
<nido> lgfl's url filtering seems to be of the sam ekind
*Tovler glances up and then looks away again.
<Phase4> nido: ah, i see what you meen now. not sure how to get around those on vhost sites but using the ip address probably breaks them
<Phase4> i made an oc http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/Screenshot%20-%20260112%20-%2023%3A32%3A36.png :3
<Ninjapony> Oooh, quite cool Phase
<MakerDusk> well done
*Phase4 must learn to draw at some point in the future
<Phase4> pony creator is good for now though
<KetaminaDianePie> still needs a cutiemark though
<nido> Phase4: you know how transparent proxies work, right?
<MakerDusk> lol, I know the feeling, Phase4
<EspyLacopa|2> Woo, new episode of DBZ Abridged
<KetaminaDianePie> :OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<MakerDusk> !cd
<Tom> Episode 15 of season 2 "The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000" airs in 2 days, 1 hours, 55 minutes, 17 seconds (Jan 28 2012 15:00:00 GMT)
<KetaminaDianePie> yes
<Phase4> nido: hijack connections with a destination port of 80 and redirect them to a proxy
<MakerDusk> so close, yet still so far...
<Phase4> well, not so much hijack as lie
<nido> Phase4: exactly. So your requests send directly to the ip addresses will also be forwarded to the proxy
<nido> (and hence also filtered)
<Phase4> yes but it filters based on the host parameter
<Phase4> so if the hostname is the ip, unless thats filtered it should work
<Phase4> wont help on vhosts but will for some sites
<MakerDusk> anyways, off to work with me
<MakerDusk> 'later
<nido> there's some truth in that
<nido> but the easiest to circumvent is to just VPN out to somewhere else; assuming traffic on other ports then port 80 is possible
<Phase4> yeah, i got past my high schools proxy with an ssh connection
<Phase4> my tafe's proxy allowd ping packets through so i could have set a tunnel up using that, couldnt be stuffed though
<nido> what's a tafe, if i may ask?
<Phase4> 'technical and further education', betwene high school and uni, australian education system whatnot
<Phase4> somewhat like collage from what i've read, but with a greater focus on trades
*Phase4 has no idea what to name his oc
<Phase4> allso my chat died again
<Phase4> nope, got better
<Dashie_Dashie> It's all trimmed up and ready for coloring :3
<Dashie_Dashie> http://i.imgur.com/HCYRD.png
<Phase4> neat
<Dashie_Dashie> Not bad for using ms paint though. =p
<Ouroboros> Hello everyone.
<Phase4> ohai Ouroboros
<Phase4> Dashie_Dashie: its excelent for mspaint
<Dashie_Dashie> Hai Ouroboros
<Ninjapony> hai Ouroboros
<Dashie_Dashie> gahh I have a headache from concentrating so long @_@
<Dashie_Dashie> Gonna go to bed in a bit
<Ouroboros> I hope you feel better for a rest.
<Ninjapony> Have a nice rest Dashie_Dashie
<Phase4> this may seem like a strange question but does my oc look a little fat http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/oc.png
*Phase4 killed the chat with his strange question
<Dashie_Dashie> Nnope
<Ouroboros> Im hardly an expert, but not particularly.
<Ninjapony> I think it looks lovely
<Dashie_Dashie> Night everypony.

<Ouroboros> Hello.
<nido> bonjour
<Ninjapony> hi
<Dashie_Dashie> who's all here right now?
<RawketLawnchair> Nothing here. . .
<HeavyMetalDash> DONE
<Dashie_Dashie> ohai heavy
<HeavyMetalDash> hey dashie whats up?
<Dashie_Dashie> Couldn't sleep
<Dashie_Dashie> sooo thinking about my cutie mark
<Dashie_Dashie> so I can put it on this OC
<Kammerjunk> So I just found out that you can go on YouTube and ask the President some questions.
<Kammerjunk> slowpoke.png
<HeavyMetalDash> I just finished a pencil sketch of myself Ponified
<Kammerjunk> I wonder why he hasn't been spammed with ACTA questions yet.
<Ninjapony> Ooh, may we see it?
<Dashie_Dashie> Let's see it HMD :3
<MirrorImage> Kammerjunk - because they seem to have made a good point of NOT letting people know about ACTA
<Kammerjunk> I want to see it too.
<HeavyMetalDash> in a sec I have no scanner so I have too make due with craptastic pics
<Kammerjunk> MirrorImage: Fair point.
<Dashie_Dashie> and I'll show you all the half finished one of mine.
<Dashie_Dashie> even though some of you have seen it but others havent :p
<Dashie_Dashie> MS Paint OC pony is best pony. :3
<Dashie_Dashie> http://i.imgur.com/YSaCl.png
<RawketLawnchair> That's notso bad.
<HeavyMetalDash> alright this is my second attempt at any sort of pony related art so It's not my best work but here
<HeavyMetalDash> http://sinshi666.deviantart.com/art/Ponified-ME-281601861
<Dashie_Dashie> Pretty B/A Heavy :o
<HeavyMetalDash> thanks
<Ninjapony> Ooh, that's cool HMD!
<Dashie_Dashie> Thinking of a name and a cutie mark for your OC pony is the hardest..
<MirrorImage> testing a different IRC client. someone ping me real quick
<Ninjapony> MirrorImage:
<TOY_PON3> good morning guys :)
<Ninjapony> Hai there TOY_PON3
<Lulu> 07,01Such a sad day..
<HeavyMetalDash> Morning TOY_PON3
<TOY_PON3> hey MirrorImage
<Ninjapony> How come Lulu ?
<TOY_PON3> and what's wrong Lulu?
<Lulu> 07,01EU signed ACTA
<Lulu> 07,01https://www.accessnow.org/page/s/just-say-no-to-acta
<nido> did???
<Ninjapony> No way :O
<TOY_PON3> That's not good at all.
<Lulu> 07,01so sign the petition.. I beg you
<TOY_PON3> will do
<Lulu> 07,01if this thing passes we will be gone
<Dashie_Dashie> DDDDDDDD:
<Lulu> 07,01heck.. the entire online community will be gone
<Lulu> 07,01EqD
<Lulu> 07,01Facebook
<Lulu> 07,01Twitter
<Lulu> 07,01Youtube
<Dashie_Dashie> I've already already signed a Petition, even though I'm from the US.
<xcanox> Meh, I'll just get a life.
<xcanox> It'll be good for me.
<Dashie_Dashie> but hell.. ACTA could get us too.
<Lulu> 07,01ACTA is global
<Lulu> 07,01it does not matter where you come from
<Lulu> 07,01+ it already passed in the US & Canada last year
<MirrorImage> ACTA is a treaty - it only has powers in nations that sign it
<MirrorImage> which, unfortunately, is a lot of nations
<nido> Liivate: got a link on that?
<Dashie_Dashie> The governments not really smart.. you take something away people need/use everyday... there will be repercussions
<HeavyMetalDash> and signed
<MirrorImage> yeah... though i think we might have easier success with ACTA now that people have seen that whining and complaining on the internet *works*

<HeavyMetalDash> I now only ever open caches for the plot
<xcanox> I watch MLP for the plot. :D
<Wrek|Observing> 05i dont
<HeavyMetalDash> Y U watch Wrek?
<xcanox> HeavyMetalDash: It's a joke. :P
<Wrek|Observing> 05cause' of the flank
<xcanox> ^
<HeavyMetalDash> I know
<otakon> dat change of terms
<otakon> also, morning Wrek|Observing
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<Wrek|Observing> 05>morning
<Wrek|Observing> 05>its 17:10
<Wrek|Observing> 05>mfw
<otakon> well
<otakon> it's morning where I am
<HeavyMetalDash> same
<otakon> how you feeling today o wrecker of bums
<xcanox> dat flank
<Radu> Good morning Wrek c:
<xcanox> "Sir! Sir!" "..What?" "Sir, what was your greatest challenge in life?" "...The 'no ponies' rule."
<Wrek> 05i slept really well, i woke up early and had a nice shower n shave, feelin' all fresh i had an awesome breakfast. on my way to the bus i took a very satisfying smoke. i began at 9:30 so i had alot more time than usual. and as i round off to the road hosting the bus stop i see my awesome morning shattered as the bus leaves withotu me, 2 minutes earlier than it should be. leaving me and
<Wrek> 5my 100% attendence shattered.
<HeavyMetalDash> oh no
<Wrek> 05which was sad cause i arrived 20 minutes late to class, and we were discussign the broke polotical system of a certain country i will nto name unless asked to
<Wrek> 05which i find itneresting
*xcanox asks Wrek what country it was
<Wrek> 05the US of A
<xcanox> Sweet. :o
<otakon> orc
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<otakon> I mean ofc
<Wrek> 05anyoen of you from the us?
<xcanox> I am.
<otakon> I am
<Wrek> 05explain what a radical is and how they are looked upon please.
<otakon> ummm
<otakon> usually badly
<xcanox> A radical is someone who takes an idea to the extreme.
<otakon> and me thinks a radical is someone against the current government
<Wrek> 05the way my teacher described it, you could put the "radical" tag on anyone within the swe political system.
<otakon> not really
<otakon> none of them are radical
<xcanox> Radicals don't have to be political.
<otakon> in the good version or the "we must change the government" way
<xcanox> A radical can be anything.
<xcanox> Like a feminist, or an anarchist, or even a chocolate milk fanatic.
<Wrek> 05ill tyr to clarify
<Wrek> 05seen from the us politicians used as a degradign term
<Wrek> 05not all ofc
<Wrek> 05but thats beside the point
<Wrek> 05but yeah anyways
<Wrek> 05to lighten the mood

*LordCelestia hugs Flaria
<otakon> kevinsano: there be hugs he, don't worry.
<Flaria> 'cause you're awesome, thats why
<RAWRity> otakon: no. Fuck that. Jonah Hill is at BEST an average actor. There were tons of other actors that deserved that spot, and Hill got in because he was in Moneyball. that's it.
<Dashie_Dashie> Hey Wrek, what do you think of my first OC pony (Done in MS Paint)?
<Dashie_Dashie> http://i.imgur.com/GcgOK.png

*otakon bricks xcanox
<Dashie_Dashie> :3

<xcanox> otakon: oic
<Dashie_Dashie> Me too Sumica.. me too.
<DinkyHooves> Can we make like a Disney movie week. We can show the old ones that aren't as well known

<xcanox> Wrek: What about Remember The Titans?
<DinkyHooves> Law Abiding Citizen wasn't that great
<xcanox> Wrek: Or Back To The Future?
<Wrek> 05nope
<xcanox> Wrek: Or The Karate Kid?
<Wrek> 05though Titan A.E would be awesoem too

<otakon> and it's NOT spoilers!
<RawketLawnchair> That's common knowledge rightr now.
<xcanox> Who's to say a newpony isn't in here, huh?!
*HeavyMetalDash wants to go hunting for blindbags but is also interested in awesome art happening now
<xcanox> \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\: Nice name.

<LunaTheBelovd> But I still play it now
<Kammerjunk> Atari was a training device just disguised as a toy.
<Ninjapony> Bioshock is easily creepy if you're in the right mood

<Kammerjunk> Pony shirts have to be washed separately, though, and much colder.
<Kammerjunk> Also, preferably with the shirt inverted.
<MirrorImage> is that supposed to be a 20% cooler reference?
<Lordkane> gz @canox
<Lordkane> nice
<MirrorImage> oh god... they're talking about tvtropes?
<Lordkane> a RD shirt wash by hand is 20% cooler like with a machine
<Kammerjunk> MFW I'm looking at the trope TB is reading.
<RawketLawnchair> Nice hat.
<MirrorImage> Got a specific trigger that sends you into a bloodthursting rage? There's a Trope for that.

<Kammerjunk> See you, Fl-
<Kammerjunk> Aww.

*LunaTheBeloved hugs Flaria
<LunaTheBeloved> Too slow.....
<Swaffy> The government, putting itself on more debt.
<Kammerjunk> >Voice recognition
<prince-dari> It would require the ISPs to spend so much money setting up everything to support ACTA too.
<Kammerjunk> Lolno.
<Dashie_Dashie> I really wish I was as good as Wrek .___.
<Swaffy> Someone's going to end up shooting someone.

<LunaTheBeloved> Then going downhill from there
<RaveBrony> Dashie_Dashie, have you worked on any drawings?

<Kammerjunk> What if you're actually not the only person in the room?
<Swaffy> http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/01/26/meet-sopas-evil-twin-acta/
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm working on one right now..
<otakon> you couldn't just use A HEADSET!?
<Dashie_Dashie> not nearly as good as him though
<LunaTheBeloved> What if someone is trying to sleep?
<Swaffy> "ACTA is a confusing mess. Even its signatories don't agree on how it's supposed to work."
<otakon> a HEADSET would WORK!
<otakon> but their only 20 bucks
<prince-dari> Upwards of 70,000 people were protesting in Poland
<Kammerjunk> But if your Kinect is in your living room, ME3 would go to hell unless you live alone.
<PartyCannon> I personally like Kinect more for its professional applications compared to games
<Robomorons> i would play doom on kinect if it registered me saying "big fucking gun"
<Kammerjunk> Robomorons: That sounds interesting, actually.
<Swaffy> Yeah, I read that. Dang, even in Poland? That's crazy.
<killcops> LOL
<Kammerjunk> If I could yell at my teammates and they would react differently, I would so play it.
<Kammerjunk> Hey, they could make it in Japan, so why not?
<RaveBrony> Im working on two myself, Dashie_Dashie....hows yours coming along?
<LunaTheBeloved> I can see it now....*someone trying to play* Submachine gun!!*Parents behind him talking to each other* Yeah and the blanket covers me perfectly....*Guy playing* NO DON'T COVER ME!!!
<Swaffy> Buy a gun before bullets are banned all over the world. Buy gas before gas is banned. XD
<Kammerjunk> LunaTheBeloved: Exactly.
<Dashie_Dashie> making some adjustments, filling in some solid lining to give it it's boldness..
<Dashie_Dashie> again.. amature compared to Wrek >_>
<Robomorons> a stealth game with kinect
<Sumica> 00,10Shizuschlafen came out so prity
<LunaTheBeloved> A stealth game with kinect would hurt from crouching so much.
<Kammerjunk> Dashie_Dashie: Well, Wrek spends like, every awake hour drawing.
<Kammerjunk> Or close enough to, anyway.
<otakon> she did
<MirrorImage> berry punch at a strip club?
<RaveBrony> Im only drawing an outline and want to make adjustments if i can get it onto the computer...
<Kammerjunk> They actually managed to make something over in Japan that would hate you if you talked bad to it.
<otakon> really?
<otakon> that's actually neat
<otakon> but I can never stand to be evil even to npc's usually
<Kammerjunk> Some guy also made a completely clone of himself, complete with dead eyes.
<RaveBrony> I cant get a top hat right on my Canterlot worthy pony....
<otakon> but
<Kammerjunk> Hiroshi Ishiguro, he's called.
<otakon> I like Male Shepards voice
<otakon> I don't like Jennifer Hale's worth though I'm afraid
<Kammerjunk> Oh, wait.
<Kammerjunk> No, it wasn't even in Japan.
<Kammerjunk> He's called Jules, made by Hanson Robotics.
<LunaTheBeloved> Alright guys I'm gonna go and get so lunch
<LunaTheBeloved> I'll bbl
<RaveBrony> Bye LunaTheBeloved, take care and enjoy
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, LunaTheBeloved.
<LunaTheBeloved> Food Fun!!
<Kammerjunk> And I'm going to go eat dinner.
<Ninjapony> Enjoy Kammerjunk|DINNAH
<RaveBrony> Wrek, how much does this program cost?
<Cy`> Watching Wrek draw, listening to the beatles, and a bit of drinking is Amazing<3
*Cy` is still at work and wishes he could do the last part..
<xcanox> Oh ponies, you've done it again!
<otakon> okay, brb need a drink and noms
<Cy`> Noo! Stupid Ad!!
<Wrek> 05around 500$
<Sumica> 00,10embrace the ABP cy'
<Saturn> 8,1i managed to convince my mother that the yellow part of a lemon meringue pie was made with the yolks of the eggs used in the meringue
<Cy`> xD
<RaveBrony> Daaang, lol. Any cheaper programs? xD
<Cy`> RaveBrony: Not really....
<Saturn> 8,1what program is it?
<Cy`> There are but not a whole lot of em.
<xcanox> "You enraged me so much I threatened an infant!!!"
<RaveBrony> Darn, guess ill have to perfect my drawing before it goes on the computer xD
<Saturn> 8,1wait, that's just illustrator
<Saturn> 8,1RaveBrony: use InkScape
<Saturn> 8,1it's free
<RaveBrony> Woah wait! Is this Seriously Berry Punch at a strip club!?!?1 Roflmao!
<Saturn> 8,1RaveBrony: also, for non-vector stuff, Paint Tool SAI is very cheap
<Radu> inb4 someone suggesting to download Ai from rapidshare
<Cy`> RaveBrony: It just depends what your good with. I have friends who are amazing with even Microsoft Paint. Just depends how you use each program.
<MirrorImage> RaveBrony, yes but my concern is who is on the pole...
<Ninjapony> Not sure if leg...
<MirrorImage> yeah... exactly
<Saturn> 8,1Radu: also, there's GIMP if you want to go the free software root
<Saturn> 8,1but that's not for vectors either
<Radu> I see
<Saturn> 8,1vectors: inkscape, non-vectors: gimp
<RaveBrony> Oh, very cool. Ty :o
<MirrorImage> there's also Paint.NET that i use rather than GIMP
<Sumica> 00,10are they argueing the merrents of demos?
<Radu> What's up with that user named _____________ ?
<Saturn> 8,1(though imo, paint tool sai is better for painting than gimp, and is well worth the money)
<MirrorImage> Radu - don't know, but it's separating the Ops/HOps/Voiced users from the normal users
<Saturn> 8,1and, of course, gimp and inkscape have the advantage of being cross-platform
<Radu> Not bad.
<RaveBrony> Do they have paint. net for Win 7?
<Saturn> 8,1thoguh i think you can run Paint Tool SAI under WINE
<RaveBrony> Ill look up inkScape too :o
<MirrorImage> Paint.NET uses the .NET Framework
<Saturn> 8,1anyhoos, that's probably not even relevant to you
<MirrorImage> so as long as Windows 7 still uses .NET, it should work
<FluttershyOHYEAH11> hello everypony
<Saturn> 8,1as you almost certainly use Windows
<Ninjapony> Hai FluttershyOHYEAH11
<Sumica> 00,10I dont aggrey with this, I would have never bought Skyrim had I not pirated it first.
<RaveBrony> Good day, FluttershytOHYEAH11!
<Saturn> 8,1RaveBrony: do you have a graphics tablet? if so, download the trial version of Paint Tool SAI
<Wrek> 05brb
<Wrek> 05dinner
<Wrek> 05and yes
<RaveBrony> I sadly dont....
<Wrek> 05thats you sumica
<Wrek> 05cause youre one devil of a stripper
<Radu> xD
<Sumica> 00,10ohmy
<Saturn> 8,1i should get DCD to stream my commission
<RaveBrony> How much does a graphics tablet cost?
<Radu> Wait, Wrek is drawing a mare, at a mare strip club, right?o__________o
<RaveBrony> yep
<MirrorImage> Radu - Berry Punch specifically
<Saturn> 8,1as you almost certainly use Windowsdon't bother with a crappy Trust tablet or similar, save up for a nice Wacom one
<Sumica> 00,10yes Radu, and depends on how big a tablit you get.
<RaveBrony> Dat Berry punch likes her mares
<MirrorImage> i almost want to suggest putting Trixie on the pole though
<Radu> I thought it was her, I didn't want to make a confusion
<RaveBrony> :o
<Radu> O U Sumica
<Saturn> 8,1ignore the first part of that sentence
<Saturn> 8,1but yeah, Trust are horrible; they're cheap, but you get what you pay for
<Radu> Berry Punch is drinking a punch. Is it a berry-kind of punch?
<Sumica> 00,10Forexample you can spend 2grand on a tablet.
<Sumica> 00,10but it's as big as a screen
<Ninjapony> Carrot Top should be on the pole
<MirrorImage> again, Trixie should be on the pole
<Radu> xD^
<Saturn> 8,1you can get a wacom bamboo for abotu $70, it hink
<RaveBrony> Ill start looking up this stuff. So paint. net, Paint Tool SAI and inkScape :o
<MirrorImage> but that's up to Wrek ultimately anyways
<Ninjapony> Trixie is such a great pony
<Radu> I use Paint.NET, it's good tbh
<MirrorImage> ..."Fluffy Puppies?"
*MirrorImage googles
<MirrorImage> ...not relevant google search
*Cy` wishes he had his guitar with him at work to work on his other job... D:
<Radu> Alright, let's start a poll. Who is the next background character to get voice?
<MirrorImage> Octavia / Vinyl
<Radu> inb4lotsof none
<MirrorImage> one or the other or, ideally, both
<Radu> I say Lyra
<RaveBrony> I say Vinyl..well, i want Vinyl, lol
<otakon> this is so wrong on SO many levels
<Radu> What's wrong, otakon?D:
<Cy`> Hmm, my say is for Octavia
<MirrorImage> and not a single care was given that day otakon
<otakon> eeyup
<RaveBrony> lol!!
<Cy`> Nothing is wrong with this otakon :3
<Radu> <------ Berry Punch is expecting a Berry Punch answer
<RaveBrony> I want Vinyl to get some lines, but I would have to say Octavia would get one before Vinyl
<FluttershyOHYEAH11> Does Dinky have a voice?
<MirrorImage> don't think so
<Wrek> 05nom pea soup with pork n mustard n spices
<FluttershyOHYEAH11> then i say dinky
<RaveBrony> :o
<otakon> nice Wrek
<Ninjapony> Octavia sounds like a good next background pony voiced
<Radu> Nice stuff you got there, pal
<otakon> wb FluttershyOHYEAH11
<RaveBrony> Sounds fancEY
<RaveBrony> Also, hopefully Bon-Bon gets a 'set' voice, haha
<xcanox> You know, I bet people get made because Trollestia trolls them. I bet if Trollestia didn't troll them, people woodknot get made.
<FluttershyOHYEAH11> Same with Doctor WHooves
<MirrorImage> yeah... Bon-Bon has had 3 different voices so far?
<RaveBrony> Yep^
<MirrorImage> "people get *made*"
<Radu> Honestly, I think Hasbro did the voice for Derpy cause she was fan-favourite. The second fan-favourite, I think, is VERY far away
<MirrorImage> Trollestia is the STork
<RaveBrony> The doll, the bag, and talking to rarity
<prince-dari> <3 Derpy
<RaveBrony> Radu, i totally agree
<Radu> Ohai Dari
<prince-dari> Hey
<MirrorImage> Radu - probably, but it'd also be easier on resources to recycle a background pony and give her a specific role
<Shizuka> 13morning dari
<RaveBrony> dat stripper pony
<MirrorImage> than it would be to create an entirely new one, if it can avoided
<prince-dari> Afternoon. :P
<Sumica> 00,10Oh hidari and Shizuka
<PartyCannon> hey dari~
<Ninjapony> Hai Dari
<RaveBrony> Good afternoon, Dari
<prince-dari> Heh, hey
<Radu> Fan favourite basically means "Look out for ______ during the episode!"
<Shizuka> 13totalbiscuit and... who else is on stream audio?
<Radu> OH man! I didn't notice the pony behind Berry

<MirrorImage> the secret life of Berry Punch...
<Radu> xD
<Kammerjunk|DINNAH> So has anypony here seen Quarantine 2?
<Ninjapony> So it's a club where they put on fancy hats and clothing
<[wub]ehren> oh don't worry
<otakon> so, the MORE clothes a pony wears the more indecent she is?
<[wub]ehren> just accidently typing my password in this chat
<otakon> that means Rarity is a strumpet!
<RaveBrony> I guess
<Ninjapony> Well, they dress up for parties though
<Radu> I don't think so, why did the mane 6 came in clothes at the gala, then?
<Kammerjunk> Oh, okay.
<Kammerjunk> Have fun with that, then.
<[wub]ehren> Already did~
<RawketLawnchair> Let's just say that Ponyville is a nudist colony and leave it at that.
<Sumica> 00,10exactly the partys are for swingers
<otakon> because it's really a Sexy Party
<RaveBrony> Or maybe, that put on barely any clothes for teasing? who knows
<Shizuka> 13silly ehren, this is why you always type passwords on the system messages page, and *never* in a channel
<otakon> What have I done!
<otakon> my MIND!
<RaveBrony> xD
<Kammerjunk> Holy bit, TB is still talking?
<[wub]ehren> I should draw a picture for my friend since its his birthday tommorow

<[wub]ehren> guess my LootaChicken will have to wait
<otakon> holy moses!
<RawketLawnchair> Biscuit is best British guy.

<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: Jesse Cox, Gunns4Hire and Dodger, I think.
<RawketLawnchair> Hey Shizuka. What pony do you like the most?
<Radu> Vi, that is.

<otakon> I didn't like WoW
<Kammerjunk> I played Runescape.

<MirrorImage> also, that stripper pole cutie mark...
<Radu> Is that a Portal 2 cutie mark?
<RaveBrony> I was both a RuneScape and WoW kid
<MirrorImage> her parents must have been so proud

<MirrorImage> yeah, i stopped playing runescape 6 months ago
<Kammerjunk> I'm purely psychosomatic.
<MirrorImage> it's starting to become too commercial now
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: wat
<MirrorImage> as evidenced by the "Get a free set of Goggles by playing the game on Google Chrome"
<RaveBrony> Sure, lol. Is it useful?
<[wub]ehren> I quit Runescape 4 years ago
<[wub]ehren> no
<[wub]ehren> like 6 years ago
<Saturn> 8,1Kammerjunk: i think it's adorable
<[wub]ehren> I quit when I was 9
<[wub]ehren> so 7 years
<[wub]ehren> huuzah
<Kammerjunk> I'm not sure what I think, but I feel bad for Fluttershy anyway.

<Sumica> 00,10Sounds like they are talking about Dust 315
<otakon> I remember that gaem
<Kammerjunk> I was extremely excited about that game.
<otakon> didn't it die?
<RaveBrony> Wrek! I am copying this stuff as you go on, is this ok? (its for understanding, lol)
<Kammerjunk> But then I saw it was solely for PS3.
<Sundaysmile> Eve?
<Kammerjunk> Then I raged.

<Kammerjunk> Sundaysmile: EVE Online is a space MMO.

<Kammerjunk> Ask any lawyer, they'll say their job is quite fun.
<otakon> I can see how making your own company seems good
<[wub]ehren> I don't find any fun in EVE either otakon
<otakon> but for gods sake
<otakon> it's a bloody battlefield
<Saturn> 8,1http://i.imgur.com/aORF5.jpg
<otakon> backstabbers everywhere!
<Kammerjunk> That's the fun of it!
<Ninjapony> So many adorable pictures! :)
<Sumica> 00,10I enjoyed eve way back when, but the death penilty changed it.
<otakon> Kammerjunk: not when it's REAL stuff you worked for
<MirrorImage> "Kuunami"
<Saturn> 8,1Ninjapony: http://cdla.deviantart.com/art/Draconequus-Fluttershy-278303727
<Sumica> 00,10When you are flying a few billion isk worth of shit it becoems stressful
<RaveBrony> O_o
<MirrorImage> Saturn - there is something wrong with that picture...
<Kammerjunk> Sumica: Well, don't fly a few billion ISK alone.
<Sundaysmile> especially when you run into gate pirates
<Ninjapony> So cuuute ;)
<MirrorImage> and i'm not only referring to the position of the tail
<Kammerjunk> Did you know that in EVE, a corp managed to infiltrate another corp and one of them even became co-CEO?
<Kammerjunk> They then took all their money, killed the CEO and flew off into the sunset.
<Kammerjunk> In space.
<Sumica> 00,10Thre is no safty in numbers
<Sundaysmile> was that a discordshy?
<otakon> yes it was
<otakon> and there are MORE
<Sundaysmile> I want one

<MirrorImage> Applecord: http://cdla.deviantart.com/art/Draconequus-Applejack-278303708
<otakon> Draconequis Mane 6
<Kammerjunk> But seriously.
<Sumica> 00,10and for the record you cant fly the ship I used alot alone. I was always in a taskforce
<Ninjapony> dat Plant vs Zombies sound
<Sumica> 00,100.0space is still stressful
<Sundaysmile> indeed
<Kammerjunk> WHY would CCP make Dust 514 only for PS3?
<otakon> Kammerjunk: eeyup and bought a super powerful ship and put a BOUNTY on his own head for the lulz
<Sundaysmile> even if you're in a CEO there is too much backstabbing and bickering
<otakon> Kammerjunk: trying to attract more users
<Kammerjunk> The PC players made EVE what it is.
<Sundaysmile> sorry corp :P
<Kammerjunk> otakon: Yeah, that was hilarious.
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, I love it when stuff like this happens.
<Kammerjunk> I love virtual corruption.
<otakon> Kammerjunk: all the EVEr's have EVE already, they are trying to attract more players
<Kammerjunk> Real life corruption is bad, though.
<Sundaysmile> granted it's not bad
<otakon> they see the PS3 group as a untapped customer base
<Kammerjunk> Aha.
<Wrek> 05hows dat mane?
<otakon> I like it
<Sumica> 00,10Kammerjunk because no othere system could intigrate with Tranquility server
<ArcherJoe11> hello Bronystate
<Sumica> 00,10wild mane there wrek
<Kammerjunk> Sumica: Or because Microsoft are too silly not to?
<Ninjapony> i really like her mane
<PartyCannon> ^
<Kammerjunk> I like that mane.
<Sundaysmile> jesse's on a rant?
<otakon> so, we got a name for her?
<Sumica> 00,10same thing realy Kammerjunk
<Sundaysmile> or did he get cut off?
<Kammerjunk> Fair point.
<ArcherJoe11> Who's played the Birthday Scenario game on EqD?
<MirrorImage> ArcherJoe11 most of us did yesterday when it posted
<otakon> I think the stream got cut off guys
<Kammerjunk> I haven't been on EQD for two weeks now.
<MirrorImage> and i promptly doomed the world with it
<Sumica> 00,10"stole the elements of harmony with zecora
<Kammerjunk> feelsbadman.jpg

<Kammerjunk> Oh, that one.
<otakon> not good Wrek
<ArcherJoe11> "Went to the Moon with Scootaloo"
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, I saw it on Facebook.
<Kammerjunk> For me, it's "Violated Princess Celestia".
<PartyCannon> Wrek: I hate when that happens -_-
<Kammerjunk> feelsbadman.
<Sundaysmile> Call Tech Support!
<Sumica> 00,10save fast wrek, it's a recersiver error. she's gonna blow
<Kammerjunk> Call in the nerds!
<MirrorImage> and i pitty whoever gets Switch Bodies with Gilda
<Sundaysmile> yeah, them...
<MirrorImage> Kammerjunk - "Are you sure that your system is plugged in?"
<Kammerjunk> MirrorImage: That could give Gilda a chance for redemption.
<Sundaysmile> "Are you using your mouse as a foot pedal?"
<MirrorImage> Kammerjunk - check the chart again and catch the joke
*MirrorImage begins a stopwatch
<Kammerjunk> MirrorImage: ...
<Kammerjunk> What chart?
<otakon> there is goes
<Sundaysmile> yay

<MirrorImage> i suspect this one is going on the pole

<Kammerjunk> Nope.
<Sundaysmile> he should give her an evil moustache and a monocle
<otakon> one of the exotic ponies clinging on BP
<MirrorImage> Kammerjunk - what would your Birthday hvae to be to get "Switch Bodies with Gilda?"
*Ninjapony "Switched bodies with Mayor Mare"
<Kammerjunk> MirrorImage: February the 30th.
<Sundaysmile> become a gold digger?
*PartyCannon started a business with Rarity
<Kammerjunk> My birthday scenario is just "Violated Princess Celestia" which, seeing her more twisted fandom version, is pretty ironic and terrifying.
*MirrorImage 's Battle Clones of Pinkie Pie begin to take over the world
<RawketLawnchair> "Started a gang with Pinkie Pie"
<RawketLawnchair> But that's stupid.
<RawketLawnchair> That chart is stupid. You're stupid!
<Kammerjunk> D:

<RawketLawnchair> Just remember
<otakon> when in doubt
<RawketLawnchair> Up is blue, down is lava and clouds taste of butter and tears.
<otakon> .....
<Kammerjunk> RawketLawnchair: That was pretty accurate.
<otakon> when is doubt, ask a mod
<Dashie_Dashie> Wingboner.
<Saturn> 8,1i love this: http://csimadmax.deviantart.com/art/Yume-Pinkie-277699903?
<Kammerjunk> When in doubt, ponies.
<[wub]ehren> otakon: "when in doubt"
<otakon> eeyup
<Ninjapony> C4
<[wub]ehren> adobe flash plugin crash.
<otakon> damn it
<[wub]ehren> gotta love the timing of that crash
<Wrek> 05really
<otakon> I hate it when that happens
<Wrek> 05when i draw these
<Wrek> 05"hawt" ponis
<Kammerjunk> Lol, [wub]ehren.
<RawketLawnchair> When you know the ending to that game, Saturn, said image is a lot more depressing.
<Shizuka> 13sauce
<Wrek> 05the mane and eye makes 70% of it
<otakon> dat sauceyness
<RawketLawnchair> Saws.
<Sundaysmile> 30% intriguing plot
<otakon> damn it Wrek, stop drawing seductive ponies!
<Shizuka> 13nein don't stop
<Kammerjunk> So has anypony here ever seen Quarantine 2?
<Ninjapony> It needs about 20% more plot
<Shizuka> 13beliiiiievein
<Sundaysmile> this plot will have an epilogue
<Midnight_Tempest> needs moar r63
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Gumri.
<RawketLawnchair> You like that song, Shizuka?
<Gumri> Hello everyone!
<otakon> Kammerjunk: isn't that a horrible sequel?
<Sundaysmile> hey gummy
<Shizuka> 13i saw an opening for a pun und i took it
<Sumica> 00,10is't that the flash game Kammerjunk?
<Ninjapony> Hi Gumri
<otakon> hiya Gumri
<Midnight_Tempest> who doesnt like Journey?
<Wrek> 05otakon is embarrased that he likes my drawings :3
<Kammerjunk> otakon: That's what I want to know.
<Kammerjunk> Sumica: wat
<xcanox> Wrek: Your drawings are the plot pics, yes?
<otakon> Wrek: I do like your drawings, you draw well.
<Sumica> 00,10I thought there was a flash game with that name
<Gumri> Wait why are they talking?
<otakon> but DAMN IT so much sauce
<Kammerjunk> Ohohoho. I like Wrek's drawings.
<Sumica> 00,10otakon embrace the sausy
<Sundaysmile> it's a saucy drawing
<otakon> I'm surprised I'm not drunk by now
<Kammerjunk> Sumica: No, it's the sequel to Quarantine.
<MirrorImage> Wrek - the issue is that when this is what i watch on the stream on a near-daily basis...
<Midnight_Tempest> more saucy! MOAR SAUCY!
<MirrorImage> it becomes harder to tell my friends "Yes, my interest in this show is chaste"
<otakon> MirrorImage: agreed
<Sundaysmile> Mirror. They can tell you're lying
<MirrorImage> yeah, and finding the proof of it isn't terribly hard
<Gumri> I had a half an hour debate about what is better: nfl or ponies.
<Saturn> 8,1MirrorImage: but... sexy ponies!
<Midnight_Tempest> ^
<Kammerjunk> I have all Wrek's drawings saved to a folder which I have linked to on my desktop.
<Sundaysmile> "Hey Mirror, can I use you computer for a minute?"
<Sumica> 00,10Clearly you must get them hooked as well then you dont have to explane shit
<Kammerjunk> I have nothing to hide.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Good morning everypony ^_^
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, SB.
<Kammerjunk> Slept well?
<Ninjapony> Hi SB

<Sumica> 00,10SB up before noon?! hory shit
<SaLKiD99> read the rules :)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02IKR
<MirrorImage> the only indication that i'm a brony on my desktop is a single folder labeled "The Pony Folder"
<Sundaysmile> good evening
<Saturn> 8,1SaLKiD99: welcome to the bronystate herd
<SaLKiD99> thank you
<MirrorImage> apart from the wallpaper, which is a night scene of the mountain Canterlot sits against
<Sundaysmile> dare they click it? yes
<MirrorImage> so if they're going to call me out on being a brony, they need to be one as well
<Saturn> 8,1we're currently watching Wrek draw sexy po nies
<Kammerjunk> SaLKiD99: And remember RawketLawnchair's words of wisdom.
<RawketLawnchair> I am very smart.
<Kammerjunk> Yes.
<SaLKiD99> ok
<Wrek> 05what words?
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: What a great way to introduce him to this site.
<Gumri> How is everypony today anyway?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02The morning sun has vanquished the horrible night.
<Sumica> 00,10oh god bloody roar, that game was so button mashing
<SaLKiD99> (P.S. : i was going to ask what we were watching...)
<Saturn> 8,1Kammerjunk: hey, it's what's on the stream!
<Saturn> 8,1
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: "Up is blue, down is lava and clouds taste of butter and tears."
<Midnight_Tempest> fighting games are bad... except for Guilty Gear and BlazBlue
<Sundaysmile> Wrek: One in the hay is worth two in the plot
<Kammerjunk> Sundaysmile: wat
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<Sundaysmile> sorry Kammer
<Gumri> I don't like any fighting games really. Only because i suck at them though
<Kammerjunk> Don't apologise.
<Kammerjunk> I had a laugh.
<Wrek> 05do ask SaLKiD99
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You call Super Smash Bros. a bad fighting game?!
<otakon> hiya SuperBrony64

<Kammerjunk> "She's yours for the night"
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hai otakon :>

<DashWithRainbows> LordCelestia inb4 Negromancers and otakon being racist :P
<otakon> please no
<otakon> why did you have to bring that up?
<Hoofy> Hi everypony!
<TrixieMuffin> Necromancy is a great tool , mainly because it freaks people out , just as a sideeffect ^^
<Nyria> Hey Hoofy ~
<otakon> hi Hoofy welcome
<SaLKiD99> hi Hoofy! :)
<DashWithRainbows> Because it was the first thing that filled my mind. But you must admit it was pretty amusing discussion otakon.
<Shizuka> 13i balme sxyparetdner
<Hoofy> :) Thanks for all the greetings!
<Nyria> I have to admit that was the first thing that came to mind~
<SaLKiD99> hmm...live stream better than Radio....

<RawketLawnchair> Faaaanfictions.

<SaLKiD99> umm...no just the song...(ok , yes it's a theme song for the fic , sorry :|)

<Shizuka> 13then let the chaingunners get him
<Sundaysmile> no bfg?
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<Saturn> 8,1a sign of things to come? http://www.megaupload.com/
<LordCelestia> 0,5http://megaupload.com/
<Midnight_Tempest> dat invisible demon
<LordCelestia> 0,5Dat ninja
<Sundaysmile> archviles kick ass
<Saturn> 8,1LordCelestia: wow, freaky
<Ingwaz> i imagine the government had enough evidence against megaupload to take it down apart from SOPA and PIPA, starting a panic will only cause trouble
<Saturn> 8,1i just linked it because i was looking at pony vids and one of the downloads was mediafire, and it reminded me of megaupload
<SaLKiD99> SOPA was the worst thing ever!
<Saturn> 8,1so i went to check if it was still down
<Sundaysmile> money laundering?
<Saturn> 8,1and was greeted by that
<LordCelestia> 0,5I just saw it somewhere else
<LordCelestia> 0,5and thought id bring it here
<LordCelestia> 0,5its
<Saturn> 8,1lulz, herdmind
<LordCelestia> 0,5DESTINY
<derpy_derpy> unproven accusations
<Nyria> Oh wow...
<Midnight_Tempest> yay Wrek
<SaLKiD99> wait , the a slot called BronyState?...
<SaLKiD99> *there's
<Nyria> Your in the slot
<PartyCannon> LordCelestia: a perfect example of why ICANN shouldn't be in charge of domains
<Ingwaz> apparently, according to a "birthday party scenario game: pony style!" i stole the elements of harmony with big mac
<SaLKiD99> hmm...what games do Wrek has?...
<Sumica> 00,10Wth wrek you go and draw me a present but you dont link me to it? =p
<Shizuka> 13mfw nukage floor and not damaging
<Fleur> Saturn and LordCelestia. Megaupload was technically breaking many federal laws. That would have happened reguardless of SOPA or ATCA
<Wrek> 05MASTER OF DODGE
<Midnight_Tempest> lol, suddenlt CyberDemon
<Shizuka> 13doomguy is dancing like a ballerina to avoid the nukage
<Saturn> 8,1Fleur: i didn't say it was because of either of those. i just think that this kind of seizure is about to become a lot more common.
<derpy_derpy> which laws? megaupload removed illegal material
<SaLKiD99> when i tried to play the Ponified Sceneraio Game , i was born in August 18 , which shows me "Went to the Moon with Scootaloo
<derpy_derpy> just like youtube
<Saturn> 8,1also, LordCelestia is turning into me
<SaLKiD99> "
<Ingwaz> poor scootaloo
<DashWithRainbows> Saturn he just needs a beard...
<Midnight_Tempest> lol hax missles
<SaLKiD99> oh , the fun in the Moon...
<LordCelestia> 0,5NUUUU
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<Saturn> 8,1just wait, he'll start hitting on guys and spouting inappropriately fetishistic randoms in no time
<Nyria> That would be intresting ...
<LordCelestia> 0,5Oh no i wouldnt dare
*LordCelestia eyes Shizuka and Wrek
<LordCelestia> 0,5>.>
<LordCelestia> 0,5<.<
<Shizuka> 13i don't suppose anyone else knows doomsday but can't you hold Alt and one of the arrows to strafe?
<SaLKiD99> not sure if it's Lag , or a Problem with the Stream...or the Buffering
<Nyria> I think this is a no Strafe run~
<Saturn> 8,1Shizuka: yup
<Saturn> 8,1iirc, you need to put it in the config
<DubZbrony> haha yearh :D! Doom! Oldschool
<Shizuka> 13wrek let the chaingunners shoot at you, they'll hit the archie and make him mad
<Midnight_Tempest> dat megasphere
<Dashie_Dashie> Hey guys, tell me.. does this need anything more added to it? (besides a background)
<Dashie_Dashie> http://i.imgur.com/s1Nxc.png
<DubZbrony> Not so long time ago i heard that this game Was Legalized in Germany hahaha
<Shizuka> 13you know, being used to modern shooters... the double shot gun has such a painfully long reload time X3
<SaLKiD99> i'm having some problem with stream...sometimes it get's laggy and/or buffers
<RawketLawnchair> Daka daka daka.
<Hoofy> Back
<Ninjapony> Lovely colouring Dashie_Dashie :)
<Midnight_Tempest> needs moar Dakka
<Hoofy> Doom, :P
<Nyria> Modern shooters are fun~ But Half life will always remain my all time fav~
<Nyria> as my*
<Dashie_Dashie> sooo... doesn't it need anymore shading? or is it good?
<DashWithRainbows> For shooters...It's gotta be TF2
<DashWithRainbows> Because hats.
<SaLKiD99> i wish i could play Team Fortress 2...
<Nyria> It ;ppls good Dashie_Dashie ~
<Fleur> my favorite shooter...
<Fleur> hm...
<Nyria> It lookss*
<MirrorImage> why can't you SaLKiD99?
<Nyria> looks*
<Fleur> I like cooperative shooters
<otakon> My favorite shooter was....
<MirrorImage> Fleur - "Cooperative." HAH
<otakon> hmm I don't have one
<PartyCannon> lol that quit message
<Midnight_Tempest> my favorite shooter would have to be... Borderlands
<Fleur> MirrorImage: L4D
<otakon> dat crash
<Ninjapony> Dat swedish windows
<DashWithRainbows> Fleur Yes. oh gawd yes.
<MirrorImage> Fleur: again, HAH
<Nyria> Oh I love L4D~
<MirrorImage> good luck in random lobbies
<DubZbrony> Counter strike source ftw :)
<SaLKiD99> my laptop is C**p and slow , and the PC in our house doesn't plays
<Nyria> I hate cars~
<Midnight_Tempest> L4D is a great game
<Fleur> MirrorImage obviously never played with a team
<derpy_derpy> never heard of marathon before
<Shizuka> 13hehe hey guys, guys... it's time for a marathon X3
<Ninjapony> Woo!
<Midnight_Tempest> yay!
<Fleur> what marathon Shizuka ?
<MirrorImage> SaLKiD99: what are the specs on your computer? I believe TF2 only asks for a Pentium 4 processor, which means 10-year-old rigs should be doable
<MirrorImage> Fleur: I have
<Nyria> I thought he actually meant he was going to do a marathon of game streaming~
<Shizuka> 13wrek ist playing marathon :P
<PartyCannon> Yes! Five thousand yeses
<MirrorImage> though my steam friend list totals about 15, and most of them i met on the TF2 Ponyville servers
<Wrek> 05had to check difficulty xD
<MirrorImage> few of them play L4D
<Midnight_Tempest> he kinda is doing a marathon of games... with marathon 2 lol
<Shizuka> 13i wonder if wrek would play quake
<Midnight_Tempest> quake whoo!
<SaLKiD99> well , i think it changed , since i accidentaly deleted windows for trying to reboot it into new
<Fleur> MirrorImage: I played 3 times a week, every week. Each play was with the same people and we always played for 8 hours straight.
<MirrorImage> Campaign or Versus?
<derpy_derpy> looks old
<Fleur> We got damn good at cooperating
<Fleur> Campaign
<Nyria> Was that the power glove?~
<Fleur> Versus is no fun because people exploit too many glitches
<SaLKiD99> and then my bigger brother (can i say my Brothers' name?) gave it to his friend to add windows 7 back
<SaLKiD99> it has 2 Resolutions , which are very bad
<Nyria> Oh I don't bother with VS~ To many people raging~
<Fleur> I liked the Specops missions in Modernwarfare 2
<SaLKiD99> it has a higher space in the hard drive...
<Fleur> But that is the only thing I liked about that game
<SaLKiD99> it's just a bit slower
<SaLKiD99> what's that sound?
<Midnight_Tempest> so much nostalgia... i love this place
*Nyria has never played any of these games that wrek streams~
<SaLKiD99> what's that sound?
<DubZbrony> pewpewpew! Always more pewpewpew
<Shizuka> 13this engine looks like a strange cross between quake und duke 3d
<SaLKiD99> i'm having a bit "bingbingbing" sound
<Midnight_Tempest> i was thinking more doom and duke 3d
<Wrek> 05its earlier than both
<Shizuka> 13was it after doom 1?
<Wrek> 05same year
<SaLKiD99> and a few days later , the charger doesn't charge anymore
<RawketLawnchair> Dooooom.
<Wrek> 05I WUB THIS SHOTGUN
<Midnight_Tempest> :D
<Flutteryay> Like. A. BAWSS.
<Fleur> who here remembers Brute Force?
<SaLKiD99> all because it turned out that the laptop was fixed by an Indian
<Midnight_Tempest> i do Fleur
<Fleur> <3
*Nyria doesn't know that game~
<derpy_derpy> marathon 1 was macintosh exclusive...I wonder why they did that
<DubZbrony> says on the Web that Bungie studioes made this Graphich Engine xD
<SaLKiD99> (you know , we have LOTS of Indians in our Country , usually working)
<Nyria> DubZbrony: Indeed they did~
<Nyria> The game was made by Bungie~
<Midnight_Tempest> swampmonsters!
<RawketLawnchair> Swiming around in that green muck can't be healthy
<DubZbrony> Didnt they They made this early games, used to hear about halo all the time too so :p thats not strange
<SaLKiD99> im going to get a new Laptop , hopefully , that is very strong
<DubZbrony> *didnt think they made
<Tovler> macintosh was king before 1995
<derpy_derpy> not really
<SaLKiD99> @SuperBrony64 why does the Stream buffers a bit?
<otakon> squishy
<Flutteryay> all of this beatiful goodness now on ichuines, ebay, amazone, napster, limewire, utorrent, and paypal
<DubZbrony> Tried restarting Web Browser or Refresh Site?
<Midnight_Tempest> ok, im gonna go for a bit guys... gonna get some excersice, later
<Nyria> ta ta Midnight_Tempest ~
<derpy_derpy> bye Midnight_Tempest
<SaLKiD99> just a moment
*Nyria hugs Midnight_Tempest ~
*Midnight_Tempest hugs Nyria back
<RawketLawnchair> So wgats this game called?
<SaLKiD99> ok im back
<Nyria> RawketLawnchair: Marathon~
<derpy_derpy> marathon 2
<RawketLawnchair> Sounds like an odd name for a =rooty tooty point and shooty.
<SaLKiD99> how do u bronies do that think which kind of makes the spelling Italic?
<RawketLawnchair> use /me
<SaLKiD99> ok , i'll try
<DubZbrony> Hes Running alot it seems, to i guess that the reason its called that :S
*SaLKiD99 is trying the /me command
*Shizuka 13thinks you are succeeding at the /me command
<Nyria> You need to try harder than that~! I want to see that text flat on the ground~!
*SaLKiD99 lols
<DubZbrony> +tn
<DubZbrony> what should that do :S
<DubZbrony> [+tn]
<Fleur> just remember SaLKiD99. Dont spam /me (not that you were. Just a friendly warning)
<SaLKiD99> ok
<SaLKiD99> sorry
<Fleur> DubZbrony: every room has +tn
<Fleur> it is what makes them a room ^_^
<Shizuka> 13back later ponies
<Nyria> ta ta ~
<Fleur> bye Shizu[AFK
<Fleur> come back soon ^_^
<Ninjapony> Bye Shizu[AFK
<DubZbrony> . NNOOOO /)oOÂ´(\
<Saturn> 8,1this is like a cross between Rise of the Triads and System Shock
*Cy` is intently watching Doom
<Fleur> SaLKiD99: you werent spamming it silly~ I was just telling you for future ref ^_^. I dont want someone to potentially get a warning from a mod ^_^
<MirrorImage> yeah, #bronystate has about 7 flags on it right now actually
<Fleur> Indeed
<Nyria> It does?~
<MirrorImage> [+JKLPjnt]
<Butterfly_Pony> back~
*Nyria hopes that none of them involve the '~' key
<MirrorImage> the ponychat client truncates, evidently
<Fleur> +KJLPjnt
<Fleur> damnit I was ninjad
<SaLKiD99> sorry Fleur , but because when i was reading it , i thought it says "...Don't Spam /me(Just a Friendly Warning)
<Fleur> none of them do Nyria ^_^
<RawketLawnchair> Airhorn alarm?
<Nyria> Good Fleur ~
<Nyria> That's great to hear~
<Kammerjunk> So when I see (+JKLPntj 5:1), what does that mean?
<RawketLawnchair> Also, if that's lava, then that is convection?
<Fleur> +K means that you cant send the exact same msg that someone sent b4 you
<MirrorImage> give me a sec; i'm looking that upmyseelf
<Kammerjunk> Oh, I mean the 5:1.
<Fleur> +J means that you cant auto rejoin
<SaLKiD99> ok , now i know what is that bing sound
<Fleur> +j means that only a certian amount of people can connect in the same second
<Kammerjunk> I just wonder what 5:1 means.
<Fleur> 5 people can connect in one second
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Nyria> Well, I didn't notice those (+'s) Until now so that means I don't have to worry about them~
<Fleur> any more and it will stop them
<MirrorImage> Kammerjunki believe the combination there is "j 5:1"
<Fleur> +n and +t are default ones
<MirrorImage> which is a throttle on the number of people who can join
<MirrorImage> in that case, 5 users in 1 second at a time
<Fleur> I just said that silly
<MirrorImage> and obviously i wasn't looking <_<
<Fleur> <3
<MirrorImage> oh look, a shiny!
*MirrorImage chases the shiny
<Nyria> Where?~
<Kammerjunk> I like shiny.
<Nyria> I like Shiny as well~
<Kammerjunk> Shiny is my favourite.
<Nyria> I need the Shiny thing
<Nyria> ~
<Fleur> I am not sure what +P is but when Shizu comes back you can ask her. She knows what she is talking about like a damn boss.
<SaLKiD99> umm , how do you do bold the name of a chatter?
<MirrorImage> SaLKiD99 - it does it automatically when you type their name
<MirrorImage> and it is case sensative
<Nyria> SaLKiD99: You don't it happens when somebody mentions your name~
<MirrorImage> and only on that user's screen
<Nyria> Oh ninja'd~
<Amras0000> Fleur: Once set, the channel will not be deleted when it becomes empty. Additionally, the +b, +e, +I and +q lists have higher capacity to make channel forwarding easier.
<Amras0000> I think
<MirrorImage> list of IRC flags: http://docs.dal.net/docs/modes.html
<Cy`> So, who's playing?
<Nyria> Marathon 2~
<SaLKiD99> so when i write , like Nyria or Fleur , do your names bolden? because when i write a name of a chatter , it isn't bolded to me
<MirrorImage> "who" not "what"
<MirrorImage> and that would be Wrek, i believe
<Cy`> Awesome.
<Cy`> Thank you MirrorImage :3
<Nyria> SaLKiD99: Indeed~ It's bold for me~
<MirrorImage> it shouldn't bold for you SaLKiD99
<Nyria> But not for you~
<SaLKiD99> oh , ok
<MirrorImage> it only bolds and pings when your own name is said
<Amras0000> MirrorImage: +P isn't there, only +p
<MirrorImage> and my bowels are telling me to get moving...
<Fleur> I get a sound when you type my name SaLKiD99
<SaLKiD99> ok
<Nyria> bing~
<SaLKiD99> well , im going to the bathroom
<Fleur> also, I shall train you in the way of Tab
<SaLKiD99> brb
<Fleur> when you get back that is
<Kammerjunk> I wish I got that sound, but I'm using XChat.
<Nyria> Fleur is master sensei~
<Fleur> Not a master ^_^

<Nyria> Marathon 2~
<Ninjapony> Don't be like Spike now Sumica
<Kammerjunk> Is that the game's title, or is it just a marathon?
<Fleur> SaLKiD99: Try typing the first 3-5 letters of someone's username and then press Tab. If you dont get their name press it again before hitting any other key. Do that untill you get the right user ^_^
<Sumica> 00,10But I want a pimp hat
<Fleur> inb4 Sumica is a dragon now
<SaLKiD99> im back
<Nyria> Fine...
<Kammerjunk> 3-5? Usually, the first two letters work for me.
*Fleur gives Sumica a grade A pimp hat
*Nyria gives Sumica his best pimp hat~
<Nyria> Oh you have 2 hats~ Just like TF2
<Kammerjunk> 2 hats? TF2?
<Nyria> put one on top of the other~
*Ninjapony gives another pimp hat for the hat stack
<Kammerjunk> That makes you a poor Scotsman.
<Fleur> Kammerjunk: I say 3-5 for when the chat is huuuuuge
<Kammerjunk> Irishman*
<otakon> is it dead yet?
<Kammerjunk> Oh. Well, I'm not here when the chat is huuuuuge, so I wouldn't know.
*Sumica grabs Fleur and hauls her off to his horde
<Ingwaz> anybody on here play terraria
<SaLKiD99> what's the Friday Stream?
<otakon> damn that overcharge
<otakon> SaLKiD99: check the "Home" page
<Kammerjunk> I do, from time to other.
<RawketLawnchair> Friday stream is movie night,
<Fleur> that starts at 7pm EST
<otakon> and Saturday Morning is PREMIERE!
<Kammerjunk> I'd ask what we were going to watch on Friday, but it wouldn't matter.
<SaLKiD99> ok
<SaLKiD99> brb
<SaLKiD99> again
<Fleur> We watch a movie then an ep
<Nyria> I just remembered... It's Thursday~
<Ingwaz> crap, got disconnected, sorry if i missed it, but anybody here play terraria?
<Fleur> then we take a 10 min break
<Kammerjunk> I'd watch literally anything on BronyState.
<Kammerjunk> Ingwaz: I do, from time to other.
<Nyria> ^
<Fleur> then we watch another movie and then another ep
<Amras0000> I play terarria
<Nyria> Indeed I would watch most things here~
<Kammerjunk> I can't bother getting it to work on Linux, though.
<otakon> what the
<DubZbrony> its a Trap!
<Kammerjunk> Suddenly, wallpaper.
<Nyria> And quit?~
<Ingwaz> anyone know how to deal with the corruption and hallowed areas after beating the wall of flesh? i didnt think theyd be this much of a pain
<arrowtobroknee> death
<Ingwaz> corruption spawned literally right next to my base
<Amras0000> well, it IS hard mode. I'd recommend looking for a tutorial on Youtube or the Terarria Wiki
<Ninjapony> Omnom skyrim
<Nyria> "Screw this I'm playing Skyrim"
<Kammerjunk> Couldn't you use that purification powder from the Dryad?
<arrowtobroknee> do you have the fluttershy mod?
<Fleur> I know what I wouldnt watch here
<Fleur> Water Babes
<Amras0000> oh wait
<SaLKiD99> im in the same room , right? if it is , im back
<Amras0000> now I remember
<Ninjapony> I'm playing Magicka right now
<Ingwaz> Kammerjunk: the corruption spreads much faster in hard mode and purification powder only does so much
<Kammerjunk> Ah.
<Sumica> 00,10ohhh, I wonder if wrek got pony mods =p
<Amras0000> dig a hole 3 blocks wide
<Fleur> The single worst movie ever. Worse than Babes in Toyland
<Amras0000> the whole height of the world
<arrowtobroknee> i hope theres the pony mods
<Kammerjunk> I haven't really played Terraria much since when that hellish-looking armour was awesome.
<Kammerjunk> Which apparently is a while back.
<arrowtobroknee> *sings along*
<Ingwaz> Amras0000: that sounds like a huge hassle, not to mention the corruption doesnt go straight down, its diagonal
<ColgateSparkle> Hey Everypony!!! :D
<Kammerjunk> AvÃª, ColgateSparkle.
<Amras0000> make sure there are no blocks in a 3 wide column from the bottom of hell to the top of the map
<Nyria> Hey ColgateSparkle ~
<Dashie_Dashie> annnnnd Done..

<Dashie_Dashie> that took forever .___.
<Nyria> And hello loading screen~
<ScootaChicken> hey there everypony ^_^
<Amras0000> that's the only way to stop it, I think
<Amras0000> otherwise, you can regularly clear it with purification powder
<ScootaChicken> anything streaming?
<SaLKiD99> hi , ScootaChicken!
<RawketLawnchair> Mmmmmdragons.
<Ninjapony> Looking cool Dashie_Dashie
<Nyria> Hey ScootaChicken ~

<Nyria> It looks great Dashie_Dashie ~
<ColgateSparkle> Fluttershy mods?
<Ninjapony> Hi ScootaChicken, SB is streaming skyrim

<SaLKiD99> why does everybody thinks Scootaloo is a Chicken?
<Ingwaz> because she is?
<Kammerjunk> SaLKiD99: Because of the other CMC.
<arrowtobroknee> because applebloom said so
<Cy`> Yeah?
<Nyria> SaLKiD99: It's a meme~
<SaLKiD99> okay
*Fleur rages when people call scoot a chicken
<Kammerjunk> In the Stare Master.
<Nyria> And what arrowtobroknee said
<arrowtobroknee> and fluttershy is a tree
<Ingwaz> and spike is rainbow dash
<ColgateSparkle> Scootaloo...scoot scoot scootaloooo :D

<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, Applebloom is a dictionary too.,
<Butterfly_Pony> and Pinkie Pie is the "big gun"
<TrixieMuffin> In their tongue he is Bronvahkyn Dragon-Brony
<otakon> 2 dictionaries and a chicken walk into a tree house
<Cy`> Fleur: Scootaloo is a chicken. <3
*DerpyHooves` sits on chat to think

<Sumica> 00,10intersting choice of weapons
<Flutteryay> Derpy Hooves is adawwwwable
<Cy`> What happened DerpyHooves` ?
<Kammerjunk> DerpyHooves`: You have no idea how hard I'm trying not to correct you.
<ColgateSparkle> Can he got 3rd person I want to see his character :)
*otakon hugs DerpyHooves` "Hello Dear!"
<Kammerjunk> Because seriously.
<Kammerjunk> It's a problem to me.
<Sumica> 00,10Oh hi DerpyHooves`
<Fleur> Cy` dont you remember what Derpy said in the ep?
<otakon> Sumica: he like dual axes is all
*SaLKiD99 still wonders why is Scootaloo a chicken and AB and SB are Dictionaries
<TrixieMuffin> 2 ponys walk into a bar , the third ducks under it
*Cy` facehoofs "Oh yeah..."
<Sumica> 00,10SaLKiD99 magic duh
<Ninjapony> SaLKiD99: It's said so in one or two episodes
<Cy`> SaLKiD99: Conversations they had in some episodes

<[wub]ehren> damnnit... my computer can't even handle skyrim with every program closed T_T
<Kammerjunk> SaLKiD99: Watch "The State Master", "The Return of Harmony: Part 1" and one of the later episodes in S2 ("Family Appreciation Day", I think) for more information.
<[wub]ehren> im so jelly
<Amras0000> I doubt it
<Amras0000> if Hasbro overuses derpy
<Kammerjunk> The Stare Master*
<MirrorImage|AFK> Butterfly_Pony - Derpy will keep appearing, i'm sure, but i doubt she'll have voice roles again
<Amras0000> she won't be as special
<Ninjapony> I tried to make a chemist joke, but all the good ones argon.
<Butterfly_Pony> ah bummer
<Kammerjunk> Wait...
<Kammerjunk> I know that voice.
<Nyria> I need some foooood~
<Kammerjunk> That's Meridith from Dragon Age II!
<arrowtobroknee> Derpy will be made into a toy
<Kammerjunk> Meredith*?
*Cy` starts rotting on the ground...
<otakon> dat Daedric Lord
<Sundaysmile> Meridia
<Kammerjunk> I like that Derpy got an appearance, but I also hope that they won't continue to cater to the fans.
<Kammerjunk> Well, in Dragon Age II, it was -ith something.
<arrowtobroknee> narrows it down
<Kammerjunk> arrowtobroknee: The Templar lady who you ended up killing.
<SaLKiD99> "Discerning the Traunsmadene" is a Daedric Quest , if u didn't know
<TrixieMuffin> Gah im getting rusty , i had to read that one 3 times to get it Sumica , H2O2

<Kammerjunk> So I found out there's a gymnasium close by which could teach me Latin properly.
<Ninjapony> That unprovoked assault
<Nyria> F5~
<Kammerjunk> Shame it doesn't have anything else I want or need.
<Randomnerd> I finally supported the show -I bought a Calender
<Kammerjunk> Can you kill this lass afterwards?
<Randomnerd> SaLKiD99, I said hi to you fist :)
<Kammerjunk> Maybe knock her unconscious and throw her in the sea?
<Shy> Well, I will be back later, then. Need to go do some stuff real quick IRL. Laterz.

<Nyria> Kammerjunk: And then make a candy bar out of the natural eviorment and give it to the person before he or she's deep sea adventure~
<SaLKiD99> just a minute
<Kammerjunk> Nyria: Quite.
<Randomnerd> Yeah, the calender uses some of Faust's concept art.
<Nyria> ta ta Shy ~
<SaLKiD99> i just missed the Action this whole time...;(
<Kammerjunk> Oh really?
<SaLKiD99> :(

<SaLKiD99> i was waiting for Randomner's Response
<SaLKiD99> and than Replied...
<SaLKiD99> and said bye too Shy...
<SaLKiD99> and then Refreshed
<Kammerjunk> SaLKiD99: You need two monitors.
<Nyria> And then Dari bot...
<Kammerjunk> It makes everything easier.
<SaLKiD99> umm , why?
<Kammerjunk> Oh, wait.
<Kammerjunk> Never mind. I'm still assuming having an IRC client is mandatory.

<Kammerjunk> Aye, I much prefer my PC over any console.
<ScootaChicken> well, lurking and being an ACTAvist
<Nyria> This feels like the Lost temple~
<Kammerjunk> Upgrading hardware is so exciting.
<GalladeXD> I hope some ponies will come on later...
<Nyria> I'm just waiting for one big rock to come down~
<Butterfly_Pony> is there a way to stop adds from popping up on the stream? ugh
<GalladeXD> .___.
<Kammerjunk> ScootaChicken: I'm planning to do that to, but I can't before tomorrow.

<[wub]ehren> and because my fingers are cold
<Convexitystormdragon> Guess not. See ya!
<Nyria> GalladeXD: It's live~
*SuperBrony64 hugs Nyria
<Kammerjunk> Are there any Linux wizards in here who have used Wine?
<Cy`> Not I..
<Kammerjunk> What a shame-.
<GalladeXD> I hope it's not an ENTIRE playthrough of Skyrim, then it would spoil the whole game for me.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm in class right now learning the deeper meaning behind the name of a private community "Plantation Oaks" O___o
<otakon> eeyup

<[wub]ehren> for a few years
<GalladeXD> DAT DRAGON.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02It's the Psychology of Prejudice and Stereotyping
<Dashie_Dashie> interesting
<Kammerjunk> But I like stereotypes!
<MadxHatter123> I gots a question. Is there a movie night tomorrow?
<Kammerjunk> Where would most comedy shows be without them?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02it's a general ed requirement :/
<Kammerjunk> MadxHatter123: Yup.
<Sumica> 00,10random horse
<StickySyrup> hey everypony !!!
<Cy`> SuperBrony64: What in the world is your Major? Because you have some of the wierdest topics in your classes...
<MadxHatter123> Ah, what's playing?
<Ninjapony> Horses in skyrim are fearless
<Ninjapony> Hi StickySyrup
<SuperBrony64> 10,02BMN is tomorrow at 7 PM EST and restreamed at 2 PM EST on Saturday
<Kammerjunk> Besides, the Danish stereotype is just weird.
<ScootaChicken> MadxHatter123, Alice in Wonderland and Epic Movie
<Butterfly_Pony> Poor dragon
<Kammerjunk> And awesome.
<ScootaChicken> its going to be horrible.
<Sumica> 00,10silly wrek no quick swap set for weapons
<[wub]ehren> OP much?
<GalladeXD> I feel bad for the dragon.
<Nyria> There goes that dragon~
<[wub]ehren> pfft
<SuperBrony64> 10,02My major is Biomedical Engineering
<[wub]ehren> the dragon didn't really die
<Nyria> Nice SB~
<Kammerjunk> According to this Internet comic I used to read, Danes are VIKINGS.
<Kammerjunk> So I won't complain.
<MadxHatter123> Cool. Can't wait.
<Cy`> It has some wierd class topics..
<Ninjapony> Its souls just got absorbed
<GalladeXD> I want its skeleton!
<Dashie_Dashie> Silly imperials
<StickySyrup> oh crap... i gtg sorry guys.. I forgot to do my coursework..
<Nyria> >A person has just slain a dragon, AI attacks said person
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Well, it's a random college requirement and this class seemed easy enough :P
*Cy` can't wait to go back to college. He finally figured out what his Major and Minor are going to be<3
<GalladeXD> FUS RO DAH!!!
<GalladeXD> I had to say that/
<Kammerjunk> A problem I have in Skyrim is that I want to pick up EVERYTHING.
<StickySyrup> byebye
<GalladeXD> XD
<StickySyrup> lol
<Kammerjunk> So I pick up a bunch of dragon bones.
<Ninjapony> He is invincible!
<Kammerjunk> And then I never sell them.
<MadxHatter123> Did he just make it storm with his voice? Awesome :O
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But after this class, im sure I won't ever discriminate between yellow and blue ponies ever again.
<MirrorImage> Kammerjunk - that's where you #1 stock up on Potions of Strength (increase carrying capacity)
<Butterfly_Pony> Nooooo
<MirrorImage> and 2 - establish a "loot chest" somewhere
<GalladeXD> HE KILLED THE HORSE. :O
<Butterfly_Pony> The horse D:
<GalladeXD> Oh well.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:P
<Kammerjunk> But I mean to sell the stuff I pick up.
<ColgateSparkle> at least itnwasnt a pony
<ColgateSparkle> D:
<Butterfly_Pony> Poor thing
<Ninjapony> Why would you do that? :O
<MadxHatter123> aw, poor horse
<Kammerjunk> I just never remember to when I'm in town.
<MirrorImage> Kammerjunk - yes, but the stores are going to run out of gold eventually
<GalladeXD> At least it wasnt Fluttershy.
<MadxHatter123> Yeah.
<MirrorImage> so whatever you want to sell but don't have the market capital for, you throw in the chest
<Kammerjunk> I do EVERYTHING in the towns I visit, but I never actually sell it.
<MirrorImage> and when you finally do remember, you go pull stuff from there
<Kammerjunk> Aha.
<Nyria> I think my foods ready~
<Kammerjunk> I just ate.
<MirrorImage> at the minimum, it keeps you from carting around unnecessary stuff
<SaLKiD99> omg...
<Cy`> Nyria: What happened to my food yesterday?
<MirrorImage> like for me, for some reason my Food tab is always unnecessarily stocked
<Ninjapony> What lousy boatmanship
<GalladeXD> How the hell did the boat get over there?!
<Butterfly_Pony> lobster?
<SaLKiD99> SOPA are Threatning the Internet , and so are ACTA?
<GalladeXD> AHHHHHHHHHHHHH CRAB!!!!
<Ninjapony> Crab people
<Darf14> Attack its weakpoint for massive damage!
<GalladeXD> At least it wasnt a spider.
<MadxHatter123> Argh, stupid ads.
<Kammerjunk> SOPA and PIPA were ultimately shelved.
<Dashie_Dashie> SOPA bombed, We need to worry about ACTA now.
<Kammerjunk> But ACTA was not.
<GalladeXD> ACTA died.
<Kammerjunk> GalladeXD: Source?
<GalladeXD> .____.
<ekips> acta got signed by 22 eu states
<MadxHatter123> Oh, jumpo crab legs.
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<Nyria> It did~?
<GalladeXD> Well, its GONNA be dead.
<Kammerjunk> Ha ha.
<Dashie_Dashie> dat noob picklocking
<Darf14> This place has a lot of giant enemy crabs
<ekips> and others want to follow
<ekips> including germany
<Kammerjunk> It's been negotiated for some years now.
<ScootaChicken> now that we've got a hold of ACTA
<GalladeXD> I hope there are no giant spiders in Skyrim.
<ScootaChicken> things are going to go a lot differently
<Dashie_Dashie> I found her Beacon on in a random chest in a giants encampment o.o
<Ninjapony> GalladeXD: Brace yourself
<MadxHatter123> That's on tricky lock.
<GalladeXD> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
<MadxHatter123> one*
<GalladeXD> NOT SPIDERS!!!
<Kammerjunk> I swear, if Google starts protesting ACTA, it's going down.
<Dashie_Dashie> I haz 70 lockpicking :3
<Kammerjunk> Google is as powerful as most nations.
<otakon> GalladeXD: you about to be disappointed
<Darf14> hmm...... that food looks edible
<Nyria> <3 google~
<SaLKiD99> wait , how old are u supposed to be to sign in? (just asking)
<GalladeXD> Theres spiders...insnt there?
<GalladeXD> *There's
<Kammerjunk> AND Google controls many states' access to their own information.
<Randomnerd> Delta squad is in yo' house, bitch!
<RawketLawnchair> Is it just me, or is the stream kinda quiet?
<GalladeXD> THATS AN UGLY ORC.
<otakon> it is
<Darf14> its a little quiet
<SaLKiD99> the stream is very quiet...
<Randomnerd> Wait, wrong lecture interruption?
<Kammerjunk> Too quiet.
<otakon> yes it is a ugly orc
<Kammerjunk> Lol.
<Darf14> no its too loud
<arrowtobroknee> that volume
<RawketLawnchair> Ah, there we go.
<Ninjapony> The stream must be hunting wabbits
<String_Shredder> i just got here. is this skyrim?
<RawketLawnchair> That's better.
<otakon> but orc's arent' SUPPOSED to be pretty
<Butterfly_Pony> it's normal cuz we're not saturday : P
<Dashie_Dashie> inb4 he gets the dawnstar blade.
<SaLKiD99> thank you , Wrek
<Nyria> inb4 it's a trap~!
<GalladeXD> But that orc is uglier than other orcs.
<Ninjapony> Flyyy!
<SaLKiD99> (if you are the Streamer)
<GalladeXD> :U
<RawketLawnchair> Woosh.
<arrowtobroknee> whitescreen
<arrowtobroknee> #
<Darf14> Beam me up!
<Kammerjunk> I didn't think the stream was quiet. But then again, my volume is at maximum.
<ColgateSparkle> Ohhhh i hate this quest....
<Ninjapony> Don\t look down
<Randomnerd> In before the Cole Train gives a speech.
<Ninjapony> aww, you looked down
<GalladeXD> He sounds weird.
<MadxHatter123> Woah, you're high up. Don't slip.
<RawketLawnchair> He? She?
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vovJ-JsK9h4 <-- Great Family Fued Moment
<Lasharus> This voice is horrendous. :P
<Randomnerd> Hop, Skip, and a Jump!
<Butterfly_Pony> ADDS ugh
<GalladeXD> The voice sounds like a nerd.
<SaLKiD99> Daedric Prince or Daedric Princess?
<Kammerjunk> Hey. Guess which very important US state is among the 60% of all US states to store their data with Google.
<Randomnerd> Texas.
<GalladeXD> CANADA!!
<String_Shredder> he said important Randomnerd
<Nyria> Uh... Mexico?~
<Kammerjunk> Nope. Washington DC.
<GalladeXD> Close enough.
<Darf14> He survived a long fall, hes good
<MadxHatter123> DC isn't a state.
<Randomnerd> lol String_Shredder, Texas is unfortunately VERY important.
<Kammerjunk> Details, details.
<SaLKiD99> hehe , Washington DC Universe...(not Trolling , just a Pun)
<GalladeXD> I thought Texas was a poor excuse to kill people for no good reason?
<RawketLawnchair> Oh man, this is just like fallout.
<ekips> uh oh, only 4 lockpicks left
<GalladeXD> NOOB PICKLOCKING.
<Kammerjunk> My point is that many of the US governments are storing their data with Google, via Google Apps.
<arrowtobroknee> no it's a good excuse to kill people for no reason
<Kammerjunk> RawketLawnchair: Gee. I wonder why.
<GalladeXD> Proof?
<String_Shredder> get the pony mod!!!!
<Randomnerd> It's the second most populous state in the Union... and until Rick Perry secedes, we're stuck with 'em.
<String_Shredder> ^
<Kammerjunk> GalladeXD: I'm not saying that they are, I'm saying that Google are saying that they are.
<Kammerjunk> But one moment anyway.
<RawketLawnchair> I bet half of the downloas for the ridable pony mod was just so people could kill them constantly and forever.
<SaLKiD99> hmm...Pony Mod? sounds like a good idea for the site
<GalladeXD> Can you play as a dragon in Skyrim?
<Randomnerd> I'm from NY, you have no idea how nice it would be if Texas left and California fell into the sea.
<MadxHatter123> Any one who has a 360 with MW3 want to play with me?
<Cy`> I'm gonna go for now, I'll talk to everyone when I get home from work. Bye Everypony!
<RAWRity> GalladeXD: nope
<SaLKiD99> bye!
<Randomnerd> Bye, Cy`
<GalladeXD> Must be a mod.
<arrowtobroknee> Expecto Patronum!
<RawketLawnchair> Well, you do have the soul of a dragon. So I guess that counts?
<MadxHatter123> by Cy`
<Darf14> bye cy
<Ninjapony> There's this mod where all the dragons are replaced by fluttershy
<Randomnerd> Kill dragons just by shouting! You can even have a beard!
<SaLKiD99> yes there is
<GalladeXD> I saw that one.
<RawketLawnchair> How horrifying.
<arrowtobroknee> Fus Ro D'aaaawww
<Randomnerd> ^
<Darf14> *gets knocked back*
<GalladeXD> When I get Skyrim, I'm gonna download the Fluttershy mod.
<Nyria> I want a beard~!
<Midnight_Tempest> its on your left wrek
<Randomnerd> Beards are awesome, Nyria.
<Ninjapony> But but but...That means killing Fluttershy :(
<Nyria> They are~
<GalladeXD> D8>
<ekips> i got stuck in the same room :D
<Randomnerd> D8
<[wub]ehren> pssht
<GalladeXD> IT'S A TRAP!!
<Midnight_Tempest> oh Wrek... passage on the left
<Kammerjunk> Goddesses, I'm going to need some headache pills. Be back in a jiffy.
<Dashie_Dashie> Be back later everypony.
<Midnight_Tempest> yay
<[wub]ehren> Needs a mod that turns all dragons to spike
<SaLKiD99> how long did this Stream go on?!
<[wub]ehren> then I could kill them
<Nyria> ta ta Dashie~
<Randomnerd> Bye, Dashie_Dashie
<SaLKiD99> bye , Dashie_Dashie!
<Darf14> bye Dashie_Dashie
<Ninjapony> It's still ongoing, SaLKiD99
<Randomnerd> Why would you want to kill Spike? :(
<Nyria> Apperently everyone at my school hates spike~
<[wub]ehren> because I wouldn't hurt an adult dragon
<RAWRity> Randomnerd: it's not spike. It's spike douche brother Skipe
<Nyria> I don't know why~
<Randomnerd> lol RAWRity.
<Randomnerd> You should just remind him to be generous!
<Midnight_Tempest> he didnt touch the pedestal...
<ekips> i think he did
<[wub]ehren> these ninja loads ect make me so jelly
<[wub]ehren> it takes me about an hour to load a new area
<Randomnerd> "I suppose you'll be eating me now, or something" and then NOTHING sexual happened.
<arrowtobroknee> use the force!
<[wub]ehren> and the game crashes if I runh even a single thing at the same time
<Butterfly_Pony> Dat lock
<ekips> last lockpick
<Midnight_Tempest> lol
<Darf14> I think lock picking looks harder here than in fallout
<ekips> there it goes
<Nyria> When having a very low ammount of lockpicks always save~
<otakon> you pansy!
<Randomnerd> Down to my last lockpick... better drink my own urine.
<Darf14> lol
<Midnight_Tempest> lockpicking in skyrim and fallout is about the same difficulty for me
<otakon> me too
<otakon> I usually get it in 2-3 tries top
<Darf14> but since hes loosing a lot of lockpicks I assume it looked hard
<otakon> he needs to buy more is all
<Midnight_Tempest> well... im gonna go play some skyrim now... with dragonponies
<otakon> oooh
<Nyria> ta ta Midnight_Tempest ~
<SaLKiD99> bye!
