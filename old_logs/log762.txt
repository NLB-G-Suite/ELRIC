<AdamTheDuck> Yeah but it's like BF3 all over agian, spamming my screen with *10 points heal* *10 points heal*
<Pokecolt> Want to know the reason I enjoy cod though?
<Pokecolt> I enjoy cod because of how fast paced the gameplay in multiplayer it.
<Pokecolt> is*
<Pokecolt> Like, you always have to be on guard, at all times.
<oni_link> Pokecolt: Me too
<DoctoDoctorWho> I prefer RTS
<AdamTheDuck> You can get the same effect with slow gameplay.
<killerpony7733> ^
<killerpony7733> Planetside 2 is like that
<Pokecolt> Not in as strong of doses though.
<oni_link> AdamTheDuck: true
<Jmo> I like it how klrpwny only jumps in on a PS2 discussion and nothing else
<Jmo> reminds me of deadpool
<oni_link> lol

<XAX> AdamTheDuck: LIES, YOU'RE AWAKE
<Pokecolt> I loved that game, a lot.
<Pokecolt> First game to use voice recognition for when you ordered your bot team to do things.

<Pokecolt> Although voice recognition has been there since Hey you, pikachu.
<AdamTheDuck> Wait
<Jmo> Battlefield 2?
<AdamTheDuck> Wow, voice chat with bots

<DoctoDoctorWho> I honest to god wish that I could relate to any of this
<Pokecolt> What would one call a pony who plays video games? (There docto, get involved on this topic. :P)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Disciple of luna?
<AdamTheDuck> I was thinking something with Luna, yeah.
<Pokecolt> Heh, moreso. What would a pony be named if it had a game controller cutie mark. ;)
<RoboGerbil> is half life 2 episode 1 the same story as half life?
<Jmo> .-.
<Jmo> Not sure if trolling or stupid.
<DoctoDoctorWho> hmmm
<Pokecolt> I am really ashamed. I am in love with two games I never played... :< And it's depressing.
<AdamTheDuck> Oh Jmo, not everyone knows their gaming history :P
<Pokecolt> Stupid money, why can't you live in my pocket and not everywhere else?
<Jmo> But Half-life.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Pokecolt: I know that feel bro
<Pokecolt> The two games I love and have never played.
<Pokecolt> Is portal 1 and portal 2.
<AdamTheDuck> Pokecolt, my feeling after any Steam sale
<Jmo> You think your wallets have had it bad .-.
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, shush you :$
<AdamTheDuck> I'm not the one trying to get 2000 games on Steam :$
<Jmo> Pfft
<Jmo> Poor ass.
<Pokecolt> I really hope PokeMMO continues to get updated in the future, the concept for pokemmo is awesome. Not to mention... I really... really... REALLY FRIGGIN LOVE this pixelmon mod I have for minecraft.
<Pokecolt> It's so awesome.
<RoboGerbil> cuz i havnt played any of the half lifes and theres a bundle for half life with all its expansions and half life 2 with all its crap not sure if its just redundant
<Jmo> There's a big plot gap between HL1 and HL2 tbh
*DoctoDoctorWho doesnt have a job
<AJIsAwesome> Pokecolt: The Powerglove?
<Jmo> Still good to play the first one though
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Firelight> Oh my god.. Hello everpony!

<Pokecolt> Why no nothing in stream thing going on? D:
<Jmo> It's something called a break Pokecolt.

<cowvarkian> Jmo: blasphemer
<Pokecolt> :> I know, I just like being ridiculous. O=3
<Jmo> Oh someone else that uses =3
<Phase4> but if you want 'not windows' use ubuntu
<Phase4> it's probably easiest
<Jmo> Still yet to use Snow Leopard
<Jmo> Mountain Lion*
<Phase4> i'm yet to use osx at all
<Phase4> no mac hardware and it hates virtual machines
<cowvarkian> so how about them ponies

<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: "That's the joke."
<Phase4> think'
<cowvarkian> Phase4: we apparently do
<AJIsAwesome> Phase4: No. :D
<aniderp> i sometimes sing sea ponies.. o.O
<Jmo> Intially, that is retarded.
<Jmo> .-.

<AJIsAwesome> All humans are morons.
<AJIsAwesome> <_<
<Phase4> cause i'm australian and i've never cooked shrimp on a bbq
<Jmo> Speak for yourself Ayejay.
<Phase4> only steak, sausages and onions
<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: Not the Liarjack emote.
<AJIsAwesome> *Note
<Phase4> i think i cooked some fresh fish once
<Pokecolt> Boop. :3
<Jmo> On a client, don't see those silly emoticons.
<Phase4> point is no shrimp
<aniderp> now to go on omegle and the question thingy and sea ponies!
<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: Sucks for you, then.
<Rommulus> Neither have I Phase4
<Jmo> Not really.
<Pokecolt> ... Phase, I wanted shrimp too. :<
<AJIsAwesome> Pokecolt: This stream's the boopinest!
<Pokecolt> BOOPINEST!?
<Pokecolt> BOOPS.
<Phase4> also aparently what you call shrimp we call prawns, shrimp here are the tiny babby ones
<Pokecolt> I love boops.
<Pokecolt> :3
<Jmo> I used to live on a yabby farm.
<Jmo> That was fun.
<Phase4> prawns are the big 8cm long things
<aniderp> everyone is d/c :<
<Pokecolt> Prawns here are generally larger sized shrimp, almost the size of crayfish.
<Phase4> Jmo: yabby's are fun
<AJIsAwesome> aniderp: Not everyone likes seaponies. :<
<Jmo> And that is where the tale of the spider the size of a car wheel came from.
<aniderp> i said sea ponies shoo be doo!
<Phase4> AJIsAwesome: Blasphemy!
<Chrysalis> blasforyou

<Chrysalis> the person i just quoted
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Pokecolt> ... I hate ADD... I keep turning my head towards the spinning circle on the stream. >_<
<Pokecolt> Make the circle go away. ;-;
<Phase4> Chrysalis: i still have no idea who that is :P
<aniderp> someone is in distress!
<cowvarkian> Chrysalis: oh yeah, I remember that one
<Chrysalis> a great comedian
<Jmo> Call upon the sea ponies.
<AJIsAwesome> But they aren't here.

<Jmo> They will be.
<Jmo> :>
<AJIsAwesome> Eventually, but not now. :<
<aniderp> yes people answering!
<Chrysalis> did the raptor and a cow in a car sketch
<Pokecolt> Have you guys watched family guy before? :3
<Jmo> Ew Family Guy
<Pokecolt> D:!
<AJIsAwesome> I have, don't really like it.
<Jmo> American humor. Psht
<Pokecolt> Anywho, if you have. I want to reference something in it.
<Phase4> i like the star wars parodys
<AJIsAwesome> Shoot.
<Pokecolt> There is something Death does in family guy, that I tried one day... and it's really friggin good.
<Jmo> Star Wars episodes were good.
<Deacon> I used t watched family guy, but then it got a bit tedious with the jokes
<Pokecolt> He spread butter on the top of a fried chicken leg.
<Pokecolt> And it was so nummeh delishness of deliciousness~!
<Phase4> normal family guy is hit and miss, not bad but i'd prefer simpsons or furutrama
<Phase4> hate american dad though
<Jmo> furutrama
<Phase4> terrible show
<Jmo> hehhehehehe
<Pokecolt> DO NOT LIKE AMERICAN DAD.
<Pokecolt> Bob's burgers is the worst out of everything though.
<Deacon> american dad was somewehat better than family guy
<TheDamShadow01> Hi everypony
<aniderp> people dont respect sea ponies ;_;
<Phase4> Pokecolt: i actually like bobs burgers
<Pokecolt> ...
<Deacon> lali-ho TheDamShadow01
<cowvarkian> so, how about that spanish inquistion
<Pokecolt> What?
<Phase4> its sometimes quite clever
<Pokecolt> Seriously phase?
<Jmo> Bob's Burgers is good
<Jmo> I love it
<Pokecolt> ...
*Pokecolt headwalls.
<Jmo> Headwall harder pls.
<Phase4> break dat wall
<Pokecolt> IMA BREAK THIS WALL WITH MY FACE.
<Jmo> ^
<Jmo> Do it.
<Phase4> reboot time
<AJIsAwesome> I saw it streamed here, it doesn't really appeal to me.
<Rommulus> Careful Pokecolt that is the 4th wal you are headwalling! Pinky has already hurt it enough
<TheDamShadow01> lol i guess the chat is having a bad day
<AJIsAwesome> We are?
<Deacon> nah it's sometimes like this
<Pokecolt> Why you say that dam?
<TheDamShadow01> just cause
<Jmo> Such a great reason.
<Jmo> Bravo.
<TheDamShadow01> i dont have anything to do XD
<Pokecolt> I've broken the 4th wall already rommulus, now I am working on the fifth and sixth walls. (Ceiling and floor.)
<Pokecolt> :3
<AJIsAwesome> You could ponder the meaning of life?
<TheDamShadow01> just gona play TF2
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: there is no meaning
<Pokecolt> Curious question so I can get some decent responses.
<Pokecolt> What would you guys rather play...
<AJIsAwesome> cowvarkian: Different views for different people.
<Pokecolt> Minecraft OR Team Fortress 2.
<AJIsAwesome> TF2.
<Jmo> Minecraft.
<AJIsAwesome> Actually, both.
<TheDamShadow01> TF2
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: well, there's no objective reason
<TheDamShadow01> XD
<Buytoast> I'd rather play something good.
<Deacon> would play TF2, but I still haven't downloaded yet
<cowvarkian> Pokecolt: minecraft
<Rommulus> Ermagerd Pokecolt you devious master mind you must be stopped before they are all broken!
<Jmo> I'd rather express my creative mind then listen to a child scream over the microphone.
<Pokecolt> I haven't played tf2 yet either, which is why I was seeing if tf2 would be picked more, if it was preferred more than MC, I would have downloaded it.
<aniderp> someone respects them!
<aniderp> stranger 2 said yay
<AJIsAwesome> Pokecolt: Seeing how they're different gameplay styles, I can't see either one as better than the other.
<XAX> Jmo: OMG STOP HACKING I'LL REPORT YOU MY BROTHER OWNS STEAM SIAJSLAKNDVONAM
<TheDamShadow01> My meaning of life is Waiting for something cool to happen XD (well that isn`t but well college)
<Pokecolt> I wish they would make a mod for tails in minecraft. ;-;
<Jmo> Oh how many times I've seen that.
<TheDamShadow01> lol
<Pokecolt> Even though they are different gameplay styles AJIsAwesome. I like to compare games like AC3 and Halo 4 at times. Even though they are different gameplay styles, just getting an idea of a game that is more played and preferred than others gives me a general good idea which would be a better choice to pick.
<Pokecolt> If a game isn't good, it wouldn't be preferred over the other choice. :3
<Jmo> dat tl;dr
<TheDamShadow01> lol
<Buytoast> But Borderlands 2 is terrible and people prefer that over good games.
<AJIsAwesome> Dat short attention span.
<Jmo> You're one to talk.
<Pokecolt> Jmo, you a pokemon fan?
<AJIsAwesome> How so?
<Jmo> As a child I was.
<aniderp> i like pokemon
<TheDamShadow01> i dont no if i buy Fraps for Record things XD
<aniderp> :>
<Pokecolt> If so, I HIGHLY RECCOMEND (caps was needed) you try the Pixelmon mod for Minecraft.
<Jmo> The fact I don't play Minecraft anymore makes me think otherwise.
<Pokecolt> D:!
<Buytoast> I childish mod for a childish game?
<TheDamShadow01> lol
<Jmo> Minecraft was only fun during Alpha/Beta
<Buytoast> How childish.
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: >.>
<Pokecolt> Buytoast, you are NEVER too old for pokemon.
<Deacon> how has minecraft been? all I remmber last time was some update with cats
<Phase4> and that crash is fixed
<Pokecolt> So your argument is invalid. :|
<Jmo> Pokecolt, don't listen to him.
<TheDamShadow01> Buy a Pacman
<TheKoreanBrony1354> HAPPY THANKS GIVING
<Phase4> i can only assume it was a problem with retail win 7 and efi
<Buytoast> You're never too old until you grow up.
<AJIsAwesome> Happy Thanksgiving, TheKoreanBrony1354. :)
<Deacon> lali-ho TheKoreanBrony1354, and happy turky day to you too
<Pokecolt> Deacon, minecraft's mechanics are so much better since those days. Good stuff has been added since then, more ambience.
<Pokecolt> It's really awesome.
<Buytoast> STUFF ADDED?
<Buytoast> TO MINECRAFT?
<Buytoast> AHAHAA
<TheKoreanBrony1354> Well instead of turkeywe have rice
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: don't you watch a show with frilly multi-colored ponies made for little girls?
<AJIsAwesome> TheKoreanBrony1354: Meh, never really liked turkey.
<XAX> Aaand then the MLP joke
<TheKoreanBrony1354> lol
<Buytoast> I only watch mature MURIKAN shows
<Pokecolt> You can't hate a nice white piece of turkey meat smothered in mashed potatoes, gravy and covered in corn.
<Buytoast> Like Lizard Lick Towing
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: like MLP
<Pokecolt> With a side of biscuits.
<Buytoast> and Operation Repo
<Jmo> Initally talking like American is even decent.
<Jmo> Lel
<aniderp> parade on!
<Pokecolt> Jmo. I am american, I speak amurrica.
<cowvarkian> you mean the parade that's the same every year?
<Pokecolt> Dat's dat.
<Pokecolt> Got dat?
<Jmo> That's good for you.
<aniderp> maybe ponies be in parade!
<Buytoast> You can't be an MURIKAN if you still play those little kid japanses pet shop fighter games boy.
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: yes you can
<XAX> lol
<Buytoast> You gotta play the games on Uncle Sam's Jam List.
<Buytoast> Call of Duty
<Buytoast> Medal of Honor
<Buytoast> Assassin's Creed 3
<VenHur> Hello everypony!
<Jmo> I can tell XAX is laughing right now.
<XAX> Battlefield 1942
<XAX> waitwhat

<cowvarkian> VenHur: buytoast is being a facetious ass
<XAX> Jmo: http://i.imgur.com/KHrDB.jpg
<Buytoast> Halo with all the enemies made to look like terrorists
<Buytoast> the works
<Deacon> Buytoast but there's loads of strategy in it, plus what's not to love taking down your foes with an adorable dragonite?
<Jmo> You look stoned bro.
<VenHur> Hope we get more Jojo's Bizzare Adventure today.
<Buytoast> Can't have no namby pamby weak small fry Commie huggers in our strong, 100% pure beef MURIKA.
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: but we do ._.
<cowvarkian> we have lots of them
<Buytoast> DRAGONS? Those aint MURIKAN son, them some Japanonese things.
<Buytoast> Now wolverines.
<cowvarkian> but we have dragons in native american folk lore
<Buytoast> Thems some MURIKAN killin machines.
<Buytoast> Indians aint MURIKAN son.
<aniderp> omg it said worlds gratest cartoon ballons
<aniderp> i think ponies are in the parade!
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: yes they are ._.
<Buytoast> If they were, why did manifest destiny make us the true MURIKANS?
<cowvarkian> because we're dickheads?
<Pokecolt> I am hungry for this...
<Pokecolt> http://www.thenationalstudent.com/articleImages/junkfood.jpg
<Buytoast> Correction.
<Buytoast> We're MURIKANS.
<Buytoast> That's what I thought.
<Buytoast> Freedom wins again.
<Pokecolt> I am such a fatty. ;-; Want to know why? I was able to name nearly every type of meat on that sandwich by it's look.
<Pokecolt> D:
<Jmo> Just when I thought an american couldn't get anymore retarded.
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: no
<Jmo> Jesus.
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, screw Manifest Destiny
<Buytoast> Screw manifest destiny?!
<cowvarkian> yes
<Buytoast> Son, without yer manifest destiny, you wouldn't be able to enjoy your Whopper with your large drink.
<cowvarkian> I don't like whoppers, or soda
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, as in I'm sick of it. I'm sick of being associated with it.
<Buytoast> Instead, you'd be eating saerkraut in yer leaderhosen while reading Mein kampf before tucking into your hitler approved bed.
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, Manifest Destiny doesn't result in freedom. It only results in tyrrany.
<cowvarkian> that seems a bit unlikely
<bicyclerepairman> I don't know what your problem with sauerkraut is
<aniderp> people
<cowvarkian> I like sauerkraut
<cowvarkian> aniderp: I'm one of those
<aniderp> worlds greatest character ballons
<Pokecolt> What's everyone's favorite type of juice?! :D
<aniderp> you think rainbow dash or ponies will be in?
<cowvarkian> Pokecolt: mango
<XAX> Buytoast: What makes a hitler approved bed?
<aniderp> i hope they arr <3
<Pokecolt> My favorite type of juice is... Hm, never really thought about it.
<Pokecolt> I like grape juice.
<Buytoast> It has to be very kampfy
<aniderp> berry juice
<XAX> LOL.
<Pokecolt> :| Does berry juice count? I mean, mixed berry juice maybe...
<aniderp> i like mixed berry also
<Pokecolt> I have never tried this, can anyone give an opinion on it if you have had it?
<Pokecolt> How is Peach Pie?
<Jmo> Peachy.
<Jmo> God I'm gonna hurt myself for that.
*Pokecolt headwalls again.
<Pokecolt> Seriously Jmo?
<Pokecolt> D<
<Jmo> :>
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, you have no understanding just how condemning you are of America by tying us in to Manifest Destiny. It makes one easily as bad as Hitler.
<Jmo> It had to be done.
<Pokecolt> Jmo, that's like saying corn tastes corny. >:C
<Buytoast> Listen here boy.
<Jmo> It does. Ahaha
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, I'm 34. Don't call me boy
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: no thanks
<Buytoast> If God didn't want us to be MURIKA.
<Pokecolt> Does fish taste fishy too Jmo?
<Jmo> Kandarihu, he's just trying to rustle jimmies.
<Buytoast> Then why didn't he stop us?
<Buytoast> BOOM
<Jmo> This is what he finds entertainment.
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: because there is no god
<Buytoast> Freedom wins again.
<XAX> REV UP THOSE JIMMIES
<Kandarihu> Jmo, then pardon me for letting him. These are fighting words.
<Jmo> You can do what you want, but I'm just saying.
<Pokecolt> Pudding sounds delicious right now.
<Buytoast> Don't worry son, MURIKA will never waver.
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: yes it will
<Buytoast> We'll stand strong.
<XAX> If atheists are so bad, then why didn't AthiestZilla attack Tokyo instead of GODZilla?
<Pokecolt> Some like, banana cream pudding with homemade sliced bananas, topped in whipped cream with cinnamon sprinkled on top.
<Pokecolt> Ooh my.
<Buytoast> On the cirpses of our enemies and eating our Freedom Fries with our extra grande all MURIKAN soft drinks.
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, we already have. We reelected a virtual dictator of a President, so we're going to have to pay a very dire price if we're ever going to learn our lesson
<Pokecolt> (If you can't tell, I talk about food and beverages to try to leviate the stress of arguments, no one can hate food. :) )
<Cypresswolf> OMG Food Talk! ^_^
*cowvarkian likes water
<Pokecolt> ^ Eats ice and drinks water for his diet.
<Pokecolt> Let it be known cowvarkian is now a plant.
<Pokecolt> :)
<Kandarihu> And those of us who voted against the creep will pay the same price. We'll all suffer together.
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: cool
<Kandarihu> cowvarkian, don't you start
<cowvarkian> ok, I'll stop starting
<Pokecolt> Jmo. I am trying so hard to pull the topic away. :'(
<Buytoast> You can't escape MURIKA'S wrath boy.
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: sure we can
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, shut up
<Jmo> You can never stop a tard from starting a topic.
<Cypresswolf> Listening to the radio the other day, a Dairy Queen worker called up and explained how they make the buns for their burgers - the slather on some butter on each bun, and toast it where the butter melts into the bread, and crispy just on the underside
<Jmo> Nor can you end it.
<XAX> Cypresswolf: The more you know.
<Jmo> As much as he finds this entertainment and is trying to rustle so many jimmies, he is looking like the biggest retard right now.
<Cypresswolf> and then there was something about pies and I lost my train of thought and stop listening
<Kandarihu> Jmo, so am I
<Jmo> And he leaves.
<Jmo> Good.
<Jmo> Spoke too soon.
<XAX> Jmo: SPOKE2SOON
<Cypresswolf> mesmerized by the image :)
<XAX> aww
<Jmo> Kandarihu, you aren't in the wrong.
<Kandarihu> Jmo, it doesn't matter what he was doing to provoke me. I was rude to a fellow user. There's no excuse for that.
<Cypresswolf> :3 you how to make grilled cheese, try this - take 5 or 6 squares of a hershey bar peanut butter and fry it the same way ^_^
<Pokecolt> Arguing political philanthropy is like arguing about circles. You will never have the edge, and it will never end on any side.
<Jmo> I didn't see it as rude.
<cowvarkian> Pokecolt: >.> tru fax
<Jmo> At least you said stuff that was at least of value.
<Buytoast> How did this all get started again?
<Buytoast> Was it Pokemon or something?
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: by you
<XAX> Buytoast: I'll check
<XAX> "Buytoast: STUFF ADDED? Buytoast: TO MINECRAFT? Buytoast: AHAHAA"
<XAX> Somewhere around there.
<Cypresswolf> I want a deep fryer for Christmas this year - and the recipe for those deep fried moon pies a certain cart at the Rodeo makes
<Buytoast> AHAHAA
<Buytoast> Minecraft
<Pokecolt> Hi cypress wolf. :) How are you?
<cowvarkian> Cypresswolf: >.>
<Pokecolt> jklafdas I REMEMBER WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. Caps cause I made my voice sound louder for a reason. >:C
<Pokecolt> Brb going to go download the call of duty mystery box sound. (Going to become my text message tone)
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ that pancake soft batter on the outside smothered in powdered sugar, melted chocolate and marshmallow dripping out of the edges :'( BEAUTIFUL!
<cowvarkian> Cypresswolf: and makes you five pounds heavier
<Cypresswolf> ^ But well worth it
<cowvarkian> when you say chocolate, do you mean the low grade hershey bars, or some chocolate actually worth eating
<Cypresswolf> I'd like to make to Texas state fair next year - all those new deep fried confectionaries they come out with each year....best food porn there is!
<Pokecolt> http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2282/1799682924_a63f9c1c2c_z.jpg ---- A pancake you can get from a restaurant here in america. :)
<Jmo> Wow.
<cowvarkian> I don't want to live on this planet anymore
<Jmo> That looks nasty.
<Buytoast> That looks about right.
<Cypresswolf> and asking the vendors how they make them :) makes you want it even more
<[]DeadpoolDash|ME3> thats a giant pastry, not a pancake
<Pokecolt> It's an apple pancake, coated in sugar and cinnamon crisp Jmo. :)
<Jmo> Return to your ME3 lolz boy
<Jmo> That is nasty Pokecolt, not even gonna lie.
<Cypresswolf> I'm not sure what that mess even is O_o
<Pokecolt> It's from a restauraunt called "The Pantry" they make some of the biggest pancakes I have ever seen.
<cowvarkian> that doesn't look much like a pancake
<Jmo> Looks like something that'll give your heart a run for its money.
<Pokecolt> Hold on, I will find some of there other non-added flavored pancakes.
<cowvarkian> sooo....
<Cypresswolf> :) This is the best food I've ever had - http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0TpeqdtdG_XFBC_Ossox9g/l.jpg - Cheesecake Factory's Hibachi Steak! - the sweetness of the steak is the PERFECT contrast to the wasabi mashed potatoes - they take some butter and wasabi powder to make the gravy, I dont know what they do to the poatoes to make them taste the way they do, but it's the mashed potatoes that make the meal
<Jmo> Looks tasty
<SirGanjalf> ^
<Cypresswolf> :) You're missing out
<Eddmario> Is this the real life?
<Eddmario> Is this just fantasy?
<SirGanjalf> and i'm hungry:|
<Eddmario> Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.
<Eddmario> Open your eyes, look up to the stars and seeeeeeee
<Cypresswolf> Food?
<Eddmario> I'm just a poor boy, I get no sympothy
<Eddmario> Happy Hearth's Warming Eve everypony!
<DinkyDoo> Hi everypony.
<Jmo> Allo
<cowvarkian> ohey
<Pokecolt> http://bacontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Giant-Bacon-Sandwich.png --- this picture can give people heart attack's just looking at it. xD
<cowvarkian> that's not even a sandwich
<cowvarkian> thats just a pile of bacon with bread
<Pokecolt> x3
<Pokecolt> It has onion on the side cow!
<Pokecolt> Look at the back.
<StinkomanFan> Happy Turkey day everypone
<DinkyDoo> SANDWHICH!
<Pokecolt> You can see onions.
<cowvarkian> Pokecolt: that makes it so much better
<StinkomanFan> Also G'morning
<Pokecolt> x
<Pokecolt> x3*
<DinkyDoo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYAGB11YrSs
<Cypresswolf> Pokecolt: Who needs the bread? Just order it like this - http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Bacon_6b8ba3_1779234.jpg
<Pokecolt> One of the greatest things I have ever eaten though, was something here in Tennesee, USA. It was a pulled pork sandwich made with homemade Apple Cider BBQ sauce. It was, literally, the greatest sandwich I have ever eaten, and possibly may ever eat.
<Eddmario> Cypresswolf: When will people learn that you can't properly link to FunnyJunk
<Pokecolt> I love apple cider personally, so it just made the bbq sauce have an extra tang to it, and... it was just so good.
<Eddmario> This is an actual burger here in town: http://www.ibetyouwont.com/monster-burger-challenge-at-flippin-eggs/
<DinkyDoo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGXFrFkxfrI
<DinkyDoo> CUPCAKES! So sweet and tasty! CUPCAKES! Don't be too hasty! CUPCAKES! Cupcakes, cupcakes, cupcakes! (THAT IS NOT THE FAN-FICTION.)
<Cypresswolf> Eddmario: http://i4.asntown.net/bacon_mountain_-ttce.jpg - that better?
<DinkyDoo> Cypresswolf: Now I want bacon..
<Cypresswolf> :3 http://www.impactlab.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Bacon-Mountain-695.jpg - The Promised Land O_O
<Eddmario> Cypresswolf: HOLY CRAP! The whole pig is right on top!
<Pokecolt> One of the best things I ever cooked myself, like homemade. Was a layer of hash browns coverd in bbq pulled pork, topped with two slices of bacon and two eggs.
<Pokecolt> I will get that thing put on breakfast menus around the globe darn it.
<Pokecolt> It was just too amazing.
<Cypresswolf> It took 400,000 lbs of bacon to make that mountain
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Pokecolt> Isn't 400,000 lbs of bacon like, around 20,000 pigs? o.o
<Jmo> Peeeta
<DinkyDoo> Bacon is delicous.
<Jmo> Peeeeeeeeta
<DinkyDoo> PEETA!?!?
<Pokecolt> x3
<DinkyDoo> Hes from the hunger games, right?
<Jmo> PETA
<Pokecolt> One thing I feel bad for eating, but I just love it too much to stop.
<Pokecolt> Is veal.
<bl1tz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0JahhFkts
<Jmo> Not Hunger Games :P
<bl1tz> =D
<Pokecolt> I love veal, even though I know how it's made.
<Pokecolt> Veal = baby cow, in case any of you have yet to learn. :)
<Jmo> Mooo
<cowvarkian> veal is delicious
<Pokecolt> Twilight sparkle's smiley face made that message complete...
<Pokecolt> It truly did.
<StinkomanFan> :)
<Pokecolt> "In case any of you have yet to learn :) "
<Pokecolt> ^ Why it was complete.
<cowvarkian> lamb is pretty good too
<Pokecolt> I have never tried duck.
<Pokecolt> Has any of you?
<StinkomanFan> The only way it could've been more complete is if there was a Cheerilee icon
<Pokecolt> Supposedly duck is really greasey.
<cowvarkian> I haven't had duck yet
<Jmo> I could never eat duck.
<Pokecolt> Why?
<StinkomanFan> quack
<Jmo> Cause I've raised ducks .-.
<Pokecolt> Aw.
<cowvarkian> well, I might've had duck in some chinese food...
<Pokecolt> Weirdest cuisine I have ever had (no one get mad at me for saying this) is lebanese cuisine.
<Pokecolt> It had the oddest flavors.
<Cypresswolf> I can make a mean stew :) Take a couple pounds of ground beef, brown it, 2-3 cans of chili, mix it - let it simmer - add potatoes, stewed tomatoes, carrots, celery, and beans - I prefer black beans for the color, but you can use whatever - I have a secret couple of ingredients I add to ground beef chili base that makes it irresistable :)
<cowvarkian> haven't had that yet
<Pokecolt> It was this weird curry that I ate.
<StinkomanFan> Psh, everypony knows chinese food is made with everything but the listed meats
<cowvarkian> heh
<Pokecolt> Cypress.
<Pokecolt> Wanna know what my favorite recipe is?
<StinkomanFan> It's made of cats, dogs, rats, hamsters...
<Pokecolt> All you have to do is take a cup of flour! Add it to the mix! Now just take a little something sweet, not sour! A bit of salt, just a pinch! Baking these treats is such a cinch! Add a teaspoon of vanilla! Add a little more, and you count to four, And you never get your fill of... Cupcakes! So sweet and tasty!
<Jmo> TELL ME YOUR SECRETSS
<Pokecolt> :)
<cowvarkian> StinkomanFan: so that's why the dumplings taste so good...
<StinkomanFan> Anything but Chicken, Pork, or beef
<Eddmario> http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/892
<DinkyDoo> U.N Owen was her..
<Pokecolt> You guys know that guinea pig is actually a really famous meat type, right?
<Pokecolt> More guinea pigs are eaten a year in comparison to buffalo.
<Cypresswolf> StinkomanFan: http://desiderius.ilcannocchiale.it/mediamanager/sys.user/43344/That_Wasnt_Chicken%5B1%5D.jpg - an honest fortune cookie
<cowvarkian> buffalo is pretty good
<DinkyDoo> U.N Owen was her..
<pony_3290> hey bronies you know what I'm not happy about?
<Jmo> Wut
<StinkomanFan> Are you saying you'd eat Little Strongheart?
<DinkyDoo> Flandre Scarlet...
<cowvarkian> pony_3290: probably
<pony_3290> why isn't mlp in the macy's parade?
<DinkyDoo> Awesome song with a creepy picture.. c:
<cowvarkian> StinkomanFan: no, because she's sentient
<Jmo> aniderp?
<Pokecolt> Has anyone here tried rabbit? I hear so much about it, I just don't have the heart to eat them..
<StinkomanFan> http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/887 pone
<Pokecolt> I would rather not eat things I would keep as pets...
<Jmo> You wouldn't keep a human as pet, so would you eat it?
<Jmo> :P
<Cypresswolf> I love buffalo wings! That's right, buffulo used to be able to fly until a certain Colonel came along >_>
<Pokecolt> This video will make some of you so happy, I think at least.
<Pokecolt> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqj3iAlfpNM --- pet squirrel.
<pony_3290> I wish they had an MLP float in the Macy's parade
<DinkyDoo> I think Macy's is to boring for MLP... MLP needs something greater than Macys..
<StinkomanFan> I think they don't have it because Pinkie Pie would potentially come alive and begin to stomp around New York
<StinkomanFan> A giant, helium filled Pinkie Pie with some poor bastards trapped to it by strings
<Pokecolt> I really want a pet squirrel now. ;-;
<cowvarkian> <.<
<StinkomanFan> A giant Pinkie Pie attacking New York, the potential of deaths would be so high that Hasbro'd rather not risk it.
<DinkyDoo> A GIANT PINKIE PIE ATTACKING NEW YORK?!
<DinkyDoo> That would lead to Cupcakes you know..
<cowvarkian> <.<
<aniderp> im watching macy's parade
<StinkomanFan> I'm sure they still have the giant Pinkie Baloon locked up deep in there facilities.
<aniderp> hopefully rainbow dash will be in parade!
<aniderp> derpy i want derpy!
<aniderp> but she would ruin things ;_;
<DinkyDoo> aniderp: Rainbow Dash + Pinkie Pie + Pinkie Pie ATTACKING New York = Cupcakes or The Rainbow Factory..
<StinkomanFan> Just waiting for the day when they'll have enough money to justify the slaughter of MAttel
<aniderp> who else watching macy parade?
<Jmo> Yahoez darling
<aniderp> got my ipod ready for mlp ballon :>
<aniderp> if they have one which i hope they do
<StinkomanFan> http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/image/563 Relevant
<Kammerjunk> Is ded chat ded?
<Kammerjunk> I guess not.
<cowvarkian> hmm
<StinkomanFan> So Kammerjunk, we're talking about potential Macy's day balloons MLP would get
<Kammerjunk> I'm sorry?
<Kammerjunk> Who's Macy?
<StinkomanFan> We decided Pinkie Pie wouldn't make it do to the potential of it coming alive and attacking New York
<StinkomanFan> Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is a tradition where a bunch of companies have floats and balloons go around New York for advertising.
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<StinkomanFan> It's an American Tradition. And Macy's is a chain of stores
<Kammerjunk> I see.
<Kammerjunk> Wait, is it Thanksgiving?
<StinkomanFan> In America it is
<Kammerjunk> Huh. Whaddaya know.
<StinkomanFan> So, what are your thoughts on a giant Pinkie Pie?
<Buytoast> Absolutely terrible.
<Kammerjunk> I can imagine.
<StinkomanFan> :O :HI NEW YORK!
<StinkomanFan> And it'd just go downhill from there
<Kandarihu> I hope there's an MLP balloon somewhere in the parade. How about Fluttershy?
<Buytoast> But horses can't talk.
<Buytoast> Neitehr can balloons.
<StinkomanFan> Pinkie Pie can.
<StinkomanFan> Because Pinkie Pie
<Buytoast> I seriously doubt they'd put a My Small Horses float in the parade.
<J_E_Smith71> No parade stream?
<Kammerjunk> I'm not surprised, Buytoast.
<StinkomanFan> >Inb4 it's somepony completely unexpected
<StinkomanFan> >Like Cheerilee
<J_E_Smith71> Buytoast: They don't need a float, just a balloon. Like Rainbow Dash flying in a dynamic pose
<Kammerjunk> It's Background Pony #56
<StinkomanFan> "IT'S PIKACHU!"
<Buytoast> I meant balloon.
<cowvarkian> its trixie
<cowvarkian> its lyra
<Cypresswolf> maybe a few years from now, they'll have a Pinkie Pie balloon or something
<J_E_Smith71> Buytoast: I mean Hello Kitty got a balloon (When have they done anything with that lately?), why not MLP?
<MadSurge> It's Spike! :D
<Buytoast> Hello Kitty has a balloon?
<Deacon> it's Gojira!
<Cypresswolf> Lambchop got a balloon - took 30 years to get there
<StinkomanFan> Oh god Cypresswolf, we went through this before. Hasbro already made one but it came alive and they don't want to risk it wrecking New York
<Spamish> Hello
<Deacon> Lamb who?
<Cypresswolf> :D
<Deacon> lali-ho Spamish
<Kammerjunk> Salve, Spamish.
<StinkomanFan> Happy Thanksgiving!
<Cypresswolf> Lamb Chop was a puppet created & voiced Sherry Lewis - got her own show in th 90's, Sherry's latter years
<Deacon> huh, interesting
<DinkyDoo> One time, I tried to sleep with my headphones on..
<Deacon> happy turdy day to you too StinkomanFan
<J_E_Smith71> But I know there's no MLp baloon, Hub and EqD would have said something
<aniderp> no ponies yet..
<Cypresswolf> Deacon: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2b4vUZ7wR4
<J_E_Smith71> When Sesame Street comes on, I bet Elmo won't be with them since Clash resigned the other day
<Kammerjunk> DinkyDoo: I think if I tried to do that, I'd break them.
<StinkomanFan> GIANT COOKIE MONSTER ATTACKING NEW YORK
<DinkyDoo> Kammerjunk: I broke them. The sound became all.. fuzzy.. but I got new ones.
<aniderp> you think ponies will be on?
<Pokecolt> Looking for text message tones is hard. x
<Cypresswolf> I remember the 90's shows, that's all I saw - wasnt until the internet int he later 90's did I find Sherry Lewis & Lambchop has been around MUCH longer
<Pokecolt> x.x*
<Spamish> StinkomanFan: just eat them
<Deacon2021> msg nickserv ghost Deacon
<StinkomanFan> Google Cookie Monster real quick Spamish
<Deacon2021> whoops
<Deacon2021> it's a good thing I didn't put my password
<Spamish> Oh crap :S yeah
<StinkomanFan> OR Grover
<StinkomanFan> Everypony loves Grover
<SpeccyRush> bishes don't know 'bout Super Grover
<StinkomanFan> "There's A Monster at the End of this Book" is a literary classic
<Deacon2021> bah
<StinkomanFan> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monster_at_the_End_of_This_Book:_Starring_Lovable,_Furry_Old_Grover BOOM, pity it spoils the ending though...
<Sylandest> Wonder if there will be an MLP float...anypony know?
<Sylandest> ...take that as a no then?
<aniderp> idk
<aniderp> i hope there is!
<aniderp> macy parade
<Sylandest> it'd be funny to see
<aniderp> thats what i watching
<StinkomanFan> I'd laugh my ass off if it's an obscure pony
<StinkomanFan> Like Soarin
<Deacon> or applejack?
<cowvarkian> >.>
<cowvarkian> or lyra
<Kammerjunk> It's Fleetfoot!
<StinkomanFan> Lyra with a huge smile on her face
<Sylandest> Inb4 Spike float
<StinkomanFan> A Big MAc float would make ALL the ladies swoon
<StinkomanFan> ALL OF THEM, regardless of whether they're watching the parade or not
<Ryunosuke> big mac float sounds too redneck :)
<J_E_Smith71> Sylandest: Not sure, Hub would have announced it
<spitfirecolt> announced what
<StinkomanFan> Like how Lucasarts would've announced being bought out by Disney :S
<J_E_Smith71> If there was a MLP balloon I think they would have mentioned it so we could look out for it
<cowvarkian> StinkomanFan: pretty sure they did
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Yo what's up?
<StinkomanFan> Only AFTER it happened
<spitfirecolt> whats up scoots
<Deacon> yo scootsa
<cowvarkian> StinkomanFan: isn't that usually how it works
<Kandarihu> StinkomanFan, you wanna see a spoiler title?
<Kandarihu> http://www.kongregate.com/games/Mazapan/you-have-to-burn-the-rope
<StinkomanFan> Scoot-Scootaloo, we wanna see the thanksgiving day parade
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Don't we all~
<spitfirecolt> i want to see the parade
<cowvarkian> am i the only one who doesn't care about the parade?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Anyway, just came to say that I hope y'all have an MLG Thanksgiving... if you celebrate it :P
<Ryunosuke> cowvarkian: nope, you arent :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> If you don't, have an MLG day!
<Syl|maid> happy thanksgiving, Scoot-Scootaloo
<spitfirecolt> i want a dashie parade balloon
<aniderp> no ponies yet :<
<Scoot-Scootaloo> OOHHHHH you want ponies?
<Ryunosuke> every year its pretty much the same
<cowvarkian> Ryunosuke: ikr
<Kammerjunk> Knowing full well what it'll bring, I vote for ponies.
<StinkomanFan> In the parade Scoots
<Kammerjunk> Oh. Aww.
<Deacon> hey, want an opinion, should I keep this moxie scraggy with dragon dance and brave nature, or should I just go for a jolly one?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> :D
<aniderp> ids there a stream or no?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Anyway, see y'all tomorrow!
<Deacon> seeya scoots
<Ryunosuke> 1) watch balloons. 2) eat lots of turkey 3) fall asleep for the rest of the afternoon while watching football 4) uhhh muffins? 5) profit :)
<aniderp> muffins!
<StinkomanFan> GTG
<spitfirecolt> i like that list
<spitfirecolt> see u scoots
<cowvarkian> <.<
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353596421989.gif behold the ultimate technique
<aniderp> ponies megaforce!
<J_E_Smith71> Oh come on the Power Rangers still get balloons too, MLP ought to be in there
<cowvarkian> inb4 its gen 3.5 mlp
<cowvarkian> or even 3.6
<aniderp> dont say that D:
<aniderp> derpy should be in the parade!
<Kammerjunk> I'd laugh if a Newborn Cuties balloon was in the parade.
<Syl|maid> If they put a balloon of MLP in the parade, the most likely candidate would be Twilight. She's kinda had the most visibility out there for the show, no? Most direct association, I mean.
<aniderp> dash is more famous
<aniderp> xD
<J_E_Smith71> Syl|maid: Rainbow Dash would be better, as a peagsus they can have her balloon look like she's flying in a dyanmic pose
<Kammerjunk> Within the community itself, I suppose Dashie's the most popular choice of favourite pony, but Twiley definitely have more screen time.
<Kammerjunk> has*
<SpeccyRush> oh lawd Power Rangers in the macy parade
<Sylandest> which power ranger did they go with?
<Kandarihu> There was a Power Rangers float?
<Sylandest> J_E_Smith71: True, true...but they'd be looking for publicity. And who has been out there the most?
<J_E_Smith71> Sylandest: The new one, but since is the anniversary they had the recent one and a bunch of old ones
<SpeccyRush> ^
<aniderp> guys and maybe girls dancing
<aniderp> in power ranger suits
<J_E_Smith71> I think in the new Power Rangers show the new team has the power to change into the old Rangers
<cowvarkian> this is why I don't watch the parade thing
<aniderp> pikachu ears D:
<aniderp> they deflated..
<Deacon> aww
<SpeccyRush> love how the commentaters ignore it
<Jmo> taters
<Jmo> lelel
<aniderp> whyy i would be like you noobs his ears deflated
<aniderp> they not suppose to be deflated
<SpeccyRush> oh hey tmnt
<J_E_Smith71> TMNT floAT
<aniderp> i would love to be in a zelda float.. or the mlp fim float
<J_E_Smith71> Uh I'd rather MLP be just a balloon if it were a float they'd have to use the G4 live show suits....
<Deacon> and that's a bad thng
<Deacon> ?
<aniderp> oh god not them creepy ones
<Zamer> morning everyponies
<Zamer> so how is everyone enjoying Day1 of Steam sale
<Deacon> mornin Zamer
<aniderp> would love to be a derpy ballon handler :>
<Kammerjunk> Zamer: Didn't even notice it.
<crazypony> hi Zamer
<Deacon> more like day 2 Zamer
<Zamer> 2hours left before day 2 starts lol
<Deacon> oh god, dead island is on sale
<Zamer> there's a lot more but they're all hidden
<Kammerjunk> I am going to buy the hay out of Train Simulator.
<Zamer> lol
<Zamer> i bought Half Minute Hero
<Zamer> and Costume quest
<Zamer> money well spent for HMH
<Deacon> how is dungeon defenders, anyone know?
<aniderp> not ponies >.>
<Zamer> I have and it's fun
<Alchemist> planetside 2 is still terrible
<Bronysith> Alchemist: not really
<Zamer> and they do have ponies on sale aniderp
<J_E_Smith71> Okay if the friggin ZuZu Pets get a flot MLP should
<Kammerjunk> Alchemist: I've been trying to play the game since it came out.
<Zamer> http://store.steampowered.com/app/45100/?snr=1_7_suggest__13
<Zamer> oh talking about the Macy's parad
<Alchemist> Bronysith: lagging out and maintaining 10 fps at 1024*768... no thanks.
<Kammerjunk> I'm only just now actually starting PS2.
<SpeccyRush> J_E_Smith71: you forget the companies pay to be in the parade
<Zamer> have they showed the Goseigers/Power Rangers Megaforce yet
<Bronysith> Alchemist: well thats just you
<Bronysith> not the games fault
<Alchemist> Bronysith: yes, thats why I said its terrible.
<Zamer> and wait zuzu pets had a float?
<Deacon> a game where you can breed magical horses?
<Bronysith> Alchemist: terrible for you, it is not the games fault at all, just your shit connection
<Alchemist> Bronysith: oh for gods sake, cant I fucking say its terrible?
<Bronysith> your reasonings behind it being terrible is bullshit
<something> hi eveypony
<Zamer> Deacon it's one of the best games ever made
<Deacon> lali-ho something
<Bronysith> Alchemist: you cant say that the game is terrible, get a better computer, conneciton and stuff and you would like it
<Alchemist> Bronysith: no, you are putting something behind it what is not there.
<J_E_Smith71> SpeccyRush: Then Hasbro sucks for not putting in money for a MLP balloon
<Bronysith> Alchemist: thats like saying skyrim sucks due to the horrible glitches
<Zamer> or the Walking Dead sucks because of it's save bug
<something> hey wrek u baned me for 2 weeks good i was on a ship
<Kammerjunk> I can't play a Bethesda game if it isn't glitchy.
<Kammerjunk> It just doesn't feel right.
<spitfirecolt> i rather the money from the ballon go to more ponies
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: it isnt a bethesda game if it isnt glitchy
<Zamer> if it isn't glitchy it isn't Bethesda
<Alchemist> Bronysith: please read back and point it out where did I say ANYTHING you ASSUMED I said. Please.
<Zamer> damn Bronysith ninja'd
<Bronysith> Alchemist: you said it is terrible because you lag and glitch out
<Kammerjunk> It'll be great when the PS2 hype has died down and I can start the bloody thing.
<Alchemist> Bronysith: so?
<Bronysith> That doesnt make it terrible, that makes your connection shit
<Bronysith> your connection being shit is no reason to say a game is terrible
<something> is ajisawome on
<Zamer> FUCK CLOWNS
<Zamer> NOT THEM
<Bronysith> That would be like saying TF2 is bad cause you cant get a good connection
<Alchemist> Bronysith: when I play a football game and I get my ass kicked because my leg hurts and someone asks how was it I say it was terrible and they fucking know what I mean.
<something> why is my sceer no work fuuu
<Alchemist> Bronysith: stop putting words in my mouth please.
<Kammerjunk> Hahaha what.
<Kammerjunk> I start up PS2 and immediately see "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."
<Bronysith> Alchemist: you said that the game sucks because you cant get a good connection, stop blaming the game for your own shitty connection
<Alchemist> Bronysith: what dont you get? I just got off PS2 and say it is still terrible. I had a bad experoience playing it. Please fucking allow me to say it was terrible without putting words in my mouth.
<cowvarkian> Kammerjunk: it's to test fonts
<cowvarkian> apparently
<RaveBrony> Hey everyone! :)
<cowvarkian> hey
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Crystal Empire DVD Already Invading Target
<Deacon> allo RaveBrony
<Kammerjunk> cowvarkian: I know, but it's not exactly supposed to be there. I can't choose a faction either.
<Bronysith> Alchemist: you said it was terrible due to your connection and 10 FPS, dont judge a game entirely because of your shitty computer
<cowvarkian> Kammerjunk: ah, well that's strange
<Pokecolt> I... What did I just watch?... ...
<Alchemist> Bronys0of my god, no matter why it was terrible, it was terrible, if you dont get this, just stop now, we are not gwtting anywhere.
<Kammerjunk> Well, I'm judging the game based on me not being able to choose an empire.
<Pokecolt> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXasCjUTNpE --- What... What did I just watch?... (Warning, some dirty material.)
<Kammerjunk> Guess I'm playing Terran.
<RaveBrony> O_o
<cowvarkian> I've had the game since it was in beta, but I've only played it twice
<CCCP> Hi
<cowvarkian> hey
<Deacon> lali-ho CCCP
<Zamer> but for the person asking about dungeon defenders its a great game and you dont need the dlc
<CCCP> Hi Deacon!
<Zamer> well unless you want to play with friends then you would
<aniderp> not ponies :<
<Kammerjunk> Well, I guess I'll play PS2 when I can bother finding out how to fix it.
<CCCP> Is there a stream?
<Bronysith> Planetside 2 is a pretty good game, pretty good for the new MMO FPS genre, you actually feel like you are one person in an entire army, it is awesome
<Zamer> the buffer is streaming
<RaveBrony> Meh, I didnt really like PS2, but I can stand playing it.
<Zamer> i wonder how Primal Carnage is
<Chrysalis> can you imagine if one day
<Bronysith> the entire airforce and tanks and ground troops, my god it is like an awesome version of BF3
<Chrysalis> just to screw with us
<Chrysalis> a mod actually streamed the buffer wheel
<Serenity> My favourite game on PS2 is Robot Wars Arena of Destruction
<Chrysalis> but going the other way
<Serenity> Next to Simpsons hit and run
<RaveBrony> Lol!!
<cowvarkian> Chrysalis: I'm sure it will happen, if it hasn't already
<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis: I wonder how long it would take for people to notice.
<Pokecolt> My fave game is both kingdom hearts games.
<Pokecolt> D<
<Pokecolt> I loved kingdom hearts so very much...
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk people would probably notice VERY quickly, but owuldnt be able to say what was different
<Serenity> Chrysalis: I could tell. Since the play button would be a pause button
<Deacon> so do I Pokecolt ;)
<Ryunosuke> KH wasnt bad
<Zamer> Tx State struuters are hot
<Deacon> did like the gameplay in II, but that's when things got complicated in the story
<Deacon> or, just plain cliche
<Chrysalis> complicated story is good
<Chrysalis> can't stand how one-dimensional most media is now
<Ryunosuke> i prefer games that take a modicum of intelligence to play
<J_E_Smith71> Briefcase Drill Team? What?
<J_E_Smith71> ...did you guys just see that?
<Ryunosuke> FFT, Civ series, EVE online, PS2 (even though my teammates dont have any intelligence) :)
<Zamer> Gary's Mod 75% off
<Kammerjunk> EVE Online is a fairly entertaining game.
<RaveBrony> Zamer: Really??
<Kammerjunk> And with entertaining, I mean that I get so much reading done while mining.
<Zamer> tea
<Zamer> yes
<Zamer> CS:S + Gary Mod: $7
<aniderp> hm
<CCCP> Is there anything streaming?
<Syl|maid> CCCP: not at this moment, no
<J_E_Smith71> CCCP: Nope

<Saturn> 08,01and Quantum Coonundrum
<CCCP> oops

<Socks> Can you only sign up for the newsletter during the film night?
<Saturn> 08,01did you know that 3/G is so battery hungry, not because of a higher power signal, but because the amount of processing needed for its complex compression and error correction algorithms is so high
<Deacon> Ish!

*IshPilgrimPony tears a hole in DoctoDoctorWho's stomach and heads for the appendix
<cowvarkian> like getting banned
<cowvarkian> it could happen
<RaveBrony> Yep
<cowvarkian> it happened to me
<DoctoDoctorWho> Yep yep, not like I even care anymore.
<Socks> cowvarkian: Do tell *grabs popcorn*
<thelonepony> :D
<killerpony7733> Dat dari
<Socks> prince-dari: :D
<cowvarkian> people were using /me too much, wrek threatened, I used it, got a 24 hour ban, and it lasted for 3 days
<killerpony7733> Dayum cowvarkian
<J_E_Smith71> Happy Thanksgiving folks: http://www.homestarrunner.com/turkey.html
<Socks> cowvarkian: How the...
<killerpony7733> But that's why you don't do such things at all and ESPECIALLY around wrek
<Boltasar> 24 hour ban... for 3 days
<Socks> 24 hours = 3 days, da what?
<Boltasar> that sounds like a 72 hour ban to me...
<cowvarkian> it was a 24 hour ban
<cowvarkian> it just didn't lift
<Boltasar> then how did it last for 3 days...
<Boltasar> aha
<Boltasar> I c
<Socks> Why put the functionality into the system if you don't want people to use it? <--(knows nothing about IRC)
<prince-dari> Bans don't lat for fixed times, they're all permanent on IRC
<prince-dari> last*
<RaveBrony> Ah
<prince-dari> To make them timed you have to either manually remove it, or set a timer to remove it for you
<Boltasar> so they have to be removed manually
<prince-dari> So a 24h ban is just a ban that we remove about 24 hours
<cowvarkian> and apparently you all forgot
<DoctoDoctorWho> 9:15 is me http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0JME7eodTk
<prince-dari> Well I leave it to the person who made the ban to unban.
<Socks> But /me, it's not like sn emoticon or colours, it just changes what you write to italic.
<Socks> *an
<cowvarkian> I know
*prince-dari appears in purple in mIRC
<Socks> prince-dari: Well we aren't mods
<Jmo> No shit >_>
<Socks> :D
<prince-dari> >implying mIRC is for mods specifically
<Kammerjunk> mIRC is pretty good.
<SpeccyRush> know your IRCclients people
<Socks> Am I wrong on that count? Oh :( Socks does bad internets
<prince-dari> >actually using a shitty web client
<prince-dari> Lel
<Jmo> Socks does real bad internets.
<Socks> As I say I know nothing about IRC, this is my first one :P
<Boltasar> I use Hydrairc
<Boltasar> but cant you change the color and stuff in the settings??
<Socks> But surely the rules of Bronystate should be based around the standerd IRC that it uses not other clients. (Could be talking crap here, don't know)
<Kammerjunk> I use mIRC on Windows and XChat on Ubuntu.
<prince-dari> There is no standard IRC client though
<Kammerjunk> Well, IRC is just that - Internet Relay Chat.
<Boltasar> I think socks means the web client
<Socks> prince-dari: I meant the Bronystate standerd *assumes that what he sees is the basic one*
<Socks> *standard
<prince-dari> The roleplay rule doesn't have anything to do with the the colour of /me anyway
<prince-dari> It's just because we aren't a roleplay room.
<Boltasar> the /meing died down quite a lot...
<prince-dari> If people want to RP they can go do it in an RP room
<RaveBrony> Indeed
<Jmo> Everyday I'm RPin'
<RaveBrony> Lol
<Kammerjunk> I used to RP like you.
<Socks> prince-dari: I get spamming, but cowvarkian did it once and got banned for it. I get overuse is annoying but there are more ways to be more annoying
<Kammerjunk> But then my D&D team just kinda fell apart.
<prince-dari> Socks: He did it after Wrek warned everyone to stop.
<prince-dari> Which is a bad move.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I JUST DONT FUCKING CARE!
<Socks> prince-dari: Ok
<Boltasar> Kammerjunk: I wish I had ppl to D&D with
<Kammerjunk> DoctoDoctorWho: Then why are you here?
<cowvarkian> dabi, I knew what I was doing
<Socks> Sorry if I'm being irritating I just want to know where I stand :P
<cowvarkian> its just slightly ridiculous why I was banned
<Jmo> You stand on thin ice at all times.
<RaveBrony> I was banned for a minute a couple of weeks ago.
<Malavolent> Ello there everybrony.
<SpeccyRush> Doing anything after Wrek says to stop is bad for your health
<Boltasar> but beware, it might just break...
*Socks sacrifices Malavolent to the mods
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: you were banned for a legit reason, just accept that you were banned and get over it
<Malavolent> I am your virgin, hand me your gods!
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: I have geeze ._.
<Kammerjunk> Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice appears under your feet.
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: your bitching says otherwise
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: cool story
<aniderp> i guess no ponies this year :<
<Kammerjunk> Splendidus narratio, frater.
<Malavolent> prince-dari: Are the gods satisfied yet?
*Boltasar wants SuperBrony64|Zzz to wake up...
<DoctoDoctorWho> You know what? I do! I do care! Thats why Im here everyday, thats why I always say hello to saturn everytime I see him! Thats why I dont stop! Cuz I fucking care!
<Jmo> And not one shit was given.
<cowvarkian> Kammerjunk: indeed
<CCCP> prince-dari so hugs are not allowed?
<prince-dari> Malavolent: We want to DoctoDoctorWho as a sacrifice
<Malavolent> prince-dari: But.. but... D:
<prince-dari> CCCP: /me isn't outlawed, but excessive use and RPing is
<Kammerjunk> Well, knock yourself out.
<Boltasar> I assume you meant to use prince-dari
<Boltasar> or get...
<DoctoDoctorWho> The most dilligent of your followers, a SACRIFICE?
<CCCP> Okay
<spitfirecolt> sacrifice me
<Kammerjunk> DoctoDoctorWho: Hey, gods love diligent people. I hear they taste kind of like beef.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Of all the STUPID!
<DoctoDoctorWho> ASANI!
<Kammerjunk> And not just any beef. That special kind of beef you can only get from the backs of well-fed cows.
<DoctoDoctorWho> SUBJECTIVE BULLSHIT!!
*DoctoDoctorWho becomes a super saiyan
<Kammerjunk> I'm just Saiyan', that's what I heard.
*Boltasar could care less about saiyans...
<Kammerjunk> I couldn't.
<aniderp> bye everyone
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, aniderp.
<Jmo> Bai aniderp
<aniderp> will be on when im at home
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye aniderp :)

<aniderp> have good thanksgiving everyone
<Kammerjunk> I'll be eating some nice lasagna tonight.
<DinkyDoo> Back from an unsaid BRB, I was eating a sandwhich in slow motion.
*DoctoDoctorWho Is literally twitching with rage
<Kammerjunk> DinkyDoo: Did awesome music play in the background?
<DinkyDoo> Kammerjunk: Yes c:
<Kammerjunk> Neat.
<Kammerjunk> DoctoDoctorWho: You know, you should see a doctor.
*Ponies47 Crashes into the chat
<Kammerjunk> It's not healthy.
<Kammerjunk> oh hi, Ponies47.
<Malavolent> prince-dari: Are you awake?
<DinkyDoo> Did I miss anything while I was eating my awesome sandwhich?
<prince-dari> Yep
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: what did you dad do now?
<Kammerjunk> Malavolent: Come now, dari never sleeps.
<Malavolent> prince-dari: Can you stream some random YTP?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai again Ponies47 :p
<DinkyDoo> Is DoctoDoctorWho mad or something..?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Kammerjunk: I dont usually get like this, its just that Im so agitated, because people hardly ever respond! When they do, we're already at this! Do you know what its like to be dilligently ignored?
<Boltasar> I do care a slight bit about saiyans
<prince-dari> I could do
<prince-dari> If I can be bothered to stream
<Jmo> Which is never.
<Jmo> Lazy pom
<CCCP> Sorry DoctoDoctorWho
<Malavolent> I heard Jmo want to sacrifice himself.
<alexxm> hey guys

*DinkyDoo LOoks at stream
<DinkyDoo> Oh look a stream ^_^
*DinkyDoo Brohoofs AJfan77
<alexxm> how are things DinkyDoo
<Kandarihu> Would Indie Game: The Movie count as an A Movie or a B Movie? It's 8.0 on IMDB
<Deacon> how much is it's budget?
<AJfan77> <_< Seems Legit >_>
<Kandarihu> Budget:
<Kandarihu> $CAD100,000 (estimated)
<Deacon> hmm, I think it would be B
<Deacon> but that's just me
<prince-dari> Sounds B to me Kandarihu, I'll take a look in a minute
<Kandarihu> I kind of thought it would be interesting if people start voting for it ONLY when it's Discounted on Steam
<AJfan77> What is this music
<LadyCanary> Raubtier?
<LadyCanary> I think.
<LadyCanary> They are some angry ass motherfuckers. But they're pretty good.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Yeah, it sounds like them :3
<Kandarihu> If it's B, then I can't vote for it. I have something else I'm desperately trying to get as a B Movie.
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^^
<MLP_Brovakiin> *^^^
<LadyCanary> Ah, you like them too, MLP_Brovakiin?
<MLP_Brovakiin> LadyCanary: Yeah I only like them as Wrek introduced me into them on the stream a while back :P
<AJfan77> It sounds like a russian having a siezure. No offence to Russians who find this very not funny joke offensive.
*Naughtymare zaps AJfan77 with a car battery
<LadyCanary> Ah same here, MLP_Brovakiin XD
<MLP_Brovakiin> :D
<LadyCanary> Im pretty open to music.
<J_E_Smith71> Hey prince-dari are you guys planning to run any special Christmas movie events outside of BMN? I was thinking of voting Christmas movies next week but I don't want to wate a vote on something you guys will show anyway
<LadyCanary> Metal especially.
<Leonid> What music playing now?
<prince-dari> We'll probably do something, but I don't think anything is currently planned
<MLP_Brovakiin> LadyCanary: I usually get questioned about them when I listen to them in school though :S damn kids these days and their dubstep or what ever crap everyone listens to nowadays :P
<LadyCanary> Just like what you like.
<Naughtymare> Dubstep, blegh
<LadyCanary> I stopped caring what people think about my music taste a long time ago.
<AJfan77> People don't respect music like they did back in the day.
<Deacon> the same could be said back in the day
<LadyCanary> I enjoy bands like Death, Dream Theater, Sabaton, Mercyful Fate.
<Deacon> it's been said every generation anyways
<Leonid> [22:20:17] <AJfan77> It sounds like a russian having a What music playing now?
<MLP_Brovakiin> LadyCanary: My friends always laugh at the fact I watch MLP and listen to heavy metal, kinda a big contrast there :P
<LadyCanary> But I also like Sara Barielles, Vocaloid music, Kate Nash, Etta James.
<XxNightHawk64xX> sup guys...oh god heavymetal.... ughhhh
<AJfan77> Leonid : a siezure is when you lie on the floor, stop breathing and have a spaz attack
<MLP_Brovakiin> XxNightHawk64xX: Don't complain, just enjoy da musics :3
<LadyCanary> MLP_Brovakiin: Like I said, you like what you like. It's what makes people unique and interesting.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Yeah true :)
<LadyCanary> Ah Wreky is wearing the invisible cloak <3
<XxNightHawk64xX> MLP_Brovakiin: i like rock just i hate metal heavy metal and death metal if there even is a difference
<MLP_Brovakiin> XxNightHawk64xX: Fair enough, each to his own
<XxNightHawk64xX> MLP_Brovakiin: this right now is fine and good just the las song was ughhh ear rape
<LadyCanary> XxNightHawk64xX: Try listening to Death. THAT is some glorious ear secks.
<Leonid> AJfan77, what it das mean?
<LadyCanary> Also, I HEAR NIGHTWISH (I think)
<XxNightHawk64xX> LadyCanary: what genre
<AJfan77> R.I.P. Headphone users
<LadyCanary> XxNightHawk64xX: Death metal XDDDD The lead singer (may he rest in peace) is considered the godfather of Death metal.
<Wrek> 05soudns like someone needs more sabaton
<SpadeMagnes[R> hai guys
<SpadeMagnes[R> :3
<LadyCanary> Ohai Wreky <3
<Deacon> ollo SpadeMagnes[R
<Ryunosuke> hey LadyCanary
<MLP_Brovakiin> Wrek: Yes please :3
<AJfan77> The king of Dubstep is Scrillex
<Ryunosuke> and wrek
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai SpadeMagnes[R :)
<LadyCanary> Wrek: GAAAY division :3
<SpadeMagnes[R> I think I played too much Halo because I automaticly thought that was a mongoose
<XxNightHawk64xX> LadyCanary: id rather pass... i hate any kind of metal it just sound like a cluster fuck of instruments and notes and people just screaming. its just my opinion so all the power to you i just cant stand it
<spitfirecolt> slow day for streaming
<MLP_Brovakiin> SpadeMagnes[R: Yeah, I am on that now :P
<Deacon> spitfirecolt well it is thankgiving
<SpadeMagnes[R> I can never understand metal
<LadyCanary> XxNightHawk64xX: Trust me, they're pretty good. And you actually can understand what they're saying at times. But to each their own, thats cool ^_^
<SpadeMagnes[R> It just seems like a bunch of screaming
<LadyCanary> It's an acquired taste, SpadeMagnes[R.
<SpadeMagnes[R> But thats just me I suppose
<Ryunosuke> Rain!
<LadyCanary> It depends on the artist, really.
<AJfan77> I'm muting this and playing Sonic music or something
<Wrek> 05i liek this song jsut for its guitar
<Wrek> 05but proper metal is queued after
<pony_3290> I'm thankful for the fact that My Little Pony friendship is magic is still on the air
<AJfan77> Last season and this season is short tho
<XxNightHawk64xX> LadyCanary: ya the only ones i like is the nazi zombies sountrack because they actually sing some times and the guitar isnt just smashing and banging it actually has a good cathcy rythm that you can remember of the top of your head. i still do hate the screaming parts in them though
<Ryunosuke> last contracted season
<Ryunosuke> they may make another season or two if contracts are renegotiated
<SpadeMagnes[R> Do you guys think this place will hold regardless if MLP ends or not?
<LadyCanary> But to be fair, a lot of metal bands use the loud random banging, but somehow it works.
<Leonid> I want some pony!
<RaveBrony> :L
<LadyCanary> Leonid: Go to youtube then.
<RaveBrony> ^
<XxNightHawk64xX> Ryunosuke: wait what mlp is ending
<Ryunosuke> ^^
<Leonid> Okay :P
<SpadeMagnes[R> I mean are we still gonna hang around here after it ends? I would like to think so
<Ryunosuke> XxNightHawk64xX: not at the moment
<Wrek> 05XxNightHawk64xX: you sound like you are condemign a whole genre based os a sub type os said genre
<Wrek> 05of*
<ekips> Leonid for the love of everything you hold dear, do NOT request ponies on bronystate
<AJfan77> SpadeMagnes[R : more than likely because the episodes are still on youtube
<LadyCanary> SABATOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<Wrek> 05now here you got some proper metal
<SpadeMagnes[R> I dont like metal but I dont say I hate all of it, I just find it my thing
<ponyguy> oh...Happy Thanksgiving American Bronies
*LadyCanary nuzzles Wreky. Thank you, hun <3
<XxNightHawk64xX> Wrek: i have no idea wha a condemign is
<SpadeMagnes[R> *dont
*MLP_Brovakiin also loves sabaton <3 :3
<SpadeMagnes[R> I tend to respect people tastes
<SpadeMagnes[R> Unless its garbage....but anyway
<AJfan77> the internet doesn't respect other peoples tastes
<SpadeMagnes[R> Opinions on the internet? HAH!
<AJfan77> BLASTPHOMY
<Kandarihu> AJfan77, internet = society
<SpadeMagnes[R> Also Im kinda sad now
<SpadeMagnes[R> My parents said we would have my birthday party today but they forgot to get me a cake
<ekips> is it just me or is the sound quality of this track a bit rough?
<MLP_Brovakiin> SpadeMagnes[R: When is it your birthday?
<RaveBrony> Yeah
<SpadeMagnes[R> It was last saturday
<LadyCanary> It does sound a bit fuzzy.
<AJfan77> I'm listening to Sonic 1's green hill zone because i dont like the music playing
<SpadeMagnes[R> My parents were both workign so we were going to have it today
<MLP_Brovakiin> Oh, happy birthday for last sunfay SpadeMagnes[R :p
<MLP_Brovakiin> *sunday
<Kandarihu> AJfan77, he has better metal on now
<SpadeMagnes[R> What defines metal?
<AJfan77> Its meh
<XxNightHawk64xX> im a brony i love and tolerate im pretty sure i repect everyones opinions unless they are completely biased and dont agree to facts. for example if someone says that COD is the best game ever i will give my opinion on it and tell them what i think. but if someone says Sonic 06 is the best sonic game or even a good game.... then love tolerance be damned i will call them idiots ecause they cant see truth
<LadyCanary> First came hard rock, which was like Zeppelin.
<LadyCanary> Then metal moved in.
<SpadeMagnes[R> Sonic 06 can be a so bad its good game sometimes
<SpadeMagnes[R> The ammount of glitches can be hilarious sometimes
<AJfan77> Ok i was kicked when i sed i didnt like the music and i did mute it so whoever just kiked me out i did wat u told me to do
<SpadeMagnes[R> Still say the best glitch is Sonic getting shot to the moon
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<AJfan77> TO THE MOOOOOOOOON
<XxNightHawk64xX> SpadeMagnes[R: at times for the funny glitches but when you get stuck on walls and get to the ball puzle and silver boss fights.... then no it cant
<Wrek> 05no, you're still complainin'
<Deacon> mine as well
<AJfan77> Ah, Sonic 06. So bad its good
<LadyCanary> Weh weh weh weh
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai AJIsAwesome :3
<SpadeMagnes[R> Also once you get the white gem and purple gem you won the game
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, MLP_Brovakiin. :)
<SpadeMagnes[R> You can pretty much break the game further with those
<AJfan77> Hi agree with u sir
<LadyCanary> YESSSSSSSS
<LadyCanary> THIS SONG <3
<ekips> gnah, I'm in the join queue of woodman :/
<LadyCanary> GOTT MIT UNS
<SpadeMagnes[R> Every time I see wooman I keep thinking of Megaman 2
<SpadeMagnes[R> *woodman
<LadyCanary> Par's bass in this song is just exceptional <3
<AJfan77> Megaman 2 was an awesome game
<SpadeMagnes[R> I still find it hilarious you can skip Silvers ball puzzle
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<XxNightHawk64xX> SpadeMagnes[R: i can understand when people say its so bad its good(even if i think its ASSHOLE INCARNATE NO MATTER WHAT.) but when someone says its a actual GOOD game then no... just... no and hell this is coming from the guy whose favorite sonic game is unleashed, i even like he werehog (stages not the concept)
<AJfan77> Buck the ball puzzle
<AJIsAwesome> It's an awesome, but overrated game IMO.
<SpadeMagnes[R> Some people still say the game would have sucked even if it wasnt rushed
<AJfan77> I like Sonic 06 because you just find so many glitches that its fun like the gems or skipping Silvers ball puzzle
<SpadeMagnes[R> Some of the gems are usless really
<SpadeMagnes[R> like the green and yellow gems
<AJIsAwesome> Unleashed was originally going to have Knuckles handle the combat sections, but he was scrapped due to time constraints IIRC.
<SpadeMagnes[R> Wait for reals?
<AJfan77> White gem and purple gem
<AJIsAwesome> Especially the greeen game.
<AJIsAwesome> *green gem
<SpadeMagnes[R> Knuckles was supposed to be in unleashed?
<SpadeMagnes[R> Huh...
<XxNightHawk64xX> SpadeMagnes[R: ya the glitches were prob because it was rushed but poor level design and ust terrible gameplay ideas have no excuse
<AJfan77> So how about the classics
<XxNightHawk64xX> AJIsAwesome: ya how much you wanna bet if it was knuckles instead of the werehog people would love the game
<SpadeMagnes[R> Im kind of glad they have Eggman/Robotnik the main bad guy again
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<SpadeMagnes[R> I kind of got tired of Robotnik being hijacked by some monster
<AJfan77> Sonic 2 is my fav game of all time.
<Deacon> ^still mine
<AJIsAwesome> I don't have a favorite Sonic game.
<Boltasar> DKC SERIES all the way, and PLOK
<SpadeMagnes[R> Sonic 3 and Knuckles best game of all time
<XxNightHawk64xX> SpadeMagnes[R: i know right. i mean i did like chaos and perfect dark gaia. but im glad that eggmans the final boss even if he does use a divine monster but ass long as hs controlling it in the final boss then thats fine
<AJfan77> I love Sonic 3 & Knuckles but i thought there were some moments where the game just wasn't fun anymore
<AJfan77> Like the entire lava reef
<Naughtymare> sonic is terrible
<SpadeMagnes[R> Lava reef had a nice soundtrack though
<Leonid> sabaton - panzerkampf, PLEASE! >_>
<Deacon> mmhmm
<AJfan77> Well were in a conversation about him so yeah
<LadyCanary> Leonid: <333333
<AJIsAwesome> I didn't really like Sandopolis. Probably because I kept timing out.
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: you ever heard of mastadon?
<XxNightHawk64xX> SpadeMagnes[R: and yes technically thats the best sonic game of all time as it does everything a sonic game shoud do but best game no.. prob zelda or something... but ven though i admit its the best sonic game i still have more fun with unleashed
<LadyCanary> ....
<LadyCanary> Sith.
<LadyCanary> Really?
<SpadeMagnes[R> Even though I like shadow, I think he might have stayed dead, or kept the ambiguous idea, is he a robot or real?
<AJIsAwesome> But I still like the music of Sandopolis.
<SpadeMagnes[R> I never liked the whole alien bullshit
<AJfan77> Carnival Night act 2 was the only time i got a time over
<SpadeMagnes[R> The fucking barrel
<LadyCanary> Bronysith: I do, dont like em too much.
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: i can get that, was just asking cause they are from my hometown >.>
<Deacon> AJfan77 how about that barrel of doom?
<XxNightHawk64xX> SpadeMagnes[R: shut up it wasnt that bad. although i will admit it was kinda dickish
<SpadeMagnes[R> Its not bad once you figure it out but its kind of ambiguous to press up and down
<LadyCanary> Play Konungens Likfärd whenever you can Wrek. If that's okay with you ^^"
<SafariMonkey> Hey guys!
<Deacon> hai SafariMonkey
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, SafariMonkey. :)
<AJfan77> I didn't know what to do when i got to the barrel then i remembered sonic shorts because it was only a while back i got to play Sonic 3 & K
<Bronysith> god why am i watching animaniacs still
<SafariMonkey> So I'm gonna play PS2 but I need to be added to skype then, please? :)
<XxNightHawk64xX> SpadeMagnes[R: ya especially since all the other barrels responded to gravity and weight instead of button input. it does throw you abit off guard
<SpadeMagnes[R> The one thing I will never understand in Sonic is how you go from the Biolizard to Shadow
<Kandarihu> It's amazing how the fandom is still around after so many failed installments of the franchise over the years
<SafariMonkey> And my only decent mouse (an MS wireless) has had all its contacts corroded out by battery fluid
<AJfan77> Looks at Sonic Genisis GBA
<Boltasar> SuperBrony64|Zzz: wake up...
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: one of the reasons it is one of the worst game fandoms ever
<SpadeMagnes[R> the 15 aniversarry was not a good year for sonic
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<XxNightHawk64xX> EVERYONE WELCOME TO BRONYSTATE WHERE ASIDE FROM THE NAME, NO ONE TALKS ABOUT MLP OR PONIES
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: so, sticking around, no matter what, = horrible fans?
<XxNightHawk64xX> INSTEAD WE TALK ABOUT SONIC AND BAD GAMES
<AJIsAwesome> XxNightHawk64xX: Well, we don't always have to talk about MLP 24/7. :3
<MLP_Brovakiin> XxNightHawk64xX: Your point?
<Bronysith> XxNightHawk64xX: you must be new here
<Kandarihu> XxNightHawk64xX, we talk about ponies sometimes
<Boltasar> what do you expect from adults... who talks about mlp...
<SpadeMagnes[R> I stick with stuff like Sonic because I feel like it will eventually get better
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[R: we can only hope
<SpadeMagnes[R> I mean hey Sonic Colors and Generations were good
<AJfan77> SpadeMagnes[R : Sonic 06 was ok. Sonic Genisis GBA is the worst game i ever played. and Sonic riders was ok
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<AJIsAwesome> I enjoyed Colors and Generations.
<XxNightHawk64xX> no im joking ive been on here for about a month. its just cause everyones talking abou everything completely unrelated today
<AJIsAwesome> *Colors/Coulors
<AJfan77> Sonic Generations 3DS has a FANTASTIC soundtrack
<Bronysith> XxNightHawk64xX: newfag
<MLP_Brovakiin> XxNightHawk64xX: So? just talking about ponies is boring :P
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: What happened to respecting others?
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: you do remember its Bronysith right
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: newfoals and newbs are an exception
<Kandarihu> Indeed. Most of the Sonic games since the end of the classic era has it's fans, even Sonic 06.
<AJfan77> AJIsAwesome : Welcome to the internet
<AJIsAwesome> cowvarkian: You do remember we have rules, right?
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: also,... >on the internet. >taking people seriously
<Kandarihu> It's just been a broken base
<SpadeMagnes[R> I still will never understand what the Biolizard was for, and the jump from that to Shadow
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: from what I remember, yes
<SpadeMagnes[R> I know it was a prototype but a Giant Lizard doesnt seem competent
<XxNightHawk64xX> AJIsAwesome: i liked unleashed colors and generations a lot but i still dont see what the hype is for sonic colors its good just overrated. i mean ya you get only sonic and supersonic but till sonic unleashed had too much speed i find colors has too much platforming
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R, uh... um... hmm... ...... ULTIMATE LIFE FORM!
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[R maybe gerald thought, it was more convient
<Bronysith> XxNightHawk64xX: you need some commas and punctuation up in that sentence
<Sonny> hi
<Sonny> bye
<SpadeMagnes[R> Isnt it confirmed that Shadow was based on Super Sonic?
<XxNightHawk64xX> and guys i know it was a joke i like mlp about as much as all of you
<LadyCanary> Carolus Rex awww YISSSS
<XxNightHawk64xX> Bronysith: ikr hahaha lol
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[R it was kinda implied since it's been known that gerald studied the mural in hidden palace zone
<SpadeMagnes[R> But god damn I hate the Artificial Chaos in SA2
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<AJfan77> SpadeMagnes[R No it wasn't but the design was
<Bronysith> poor beethoven
<J_E_Smith71> And I turn away for lunch and we have a Sonic discussion
<BaconMane> 0,5Ew gey
<AJIsAwesome> They would always mess up your Ring Count, ridding you of the chance of getting an A rank.
<AJIsAwesome> Ew Bacon. :3
<J_E_Smith71> Happy Turkey Day AJIsAwesome
<XxNightHawk64xX> SpadeMagnes[R: no its a fan theory a goood one actually. they say gerald robotnick say a mural of super sonic and one of perfect chaos and based shadow off of supersonic and biolizard off of perfect chaos
<AJIsAwesome> Happy Turkey Day to you too, J_E_Smith71. :)
<Bronysith> Besides
<Bronysith> Mario>sonic
<AJIsAwesome> Mario=Sonic.
<AJfan77> Sonic 2's slicers are MUCH WORSE THAN ARTIFICIAL CHAOS
<SpadeMagnes[R> FUCKING SLICERS
<AJfan77> I
<XxNightHawk64xX> FUCKING SLICEEEERRRRSSSS
<AJfan77> HATE
<AJfan77> SLICERS
<LadyCanary> Chill.

<XxNightHawk64xX> somecallmejohnny FTW
<cowvarkian> BaconMane: ikr
<SpadeMagnes[R> Breakdancing eggmaaaaaan
<Bronysith> nothing is more amusing than sonic fans
<AJIsAwesome> *Cue various explosions*
<Deacon> XxNightHawk64xX aha, you watch him as well, neat
<AJfan77> YOU GOT THE REFERANCE yay :(
<J_E_Smith71> At least with the Slicers, you either have Super Sonic at that point.
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: You may be right.
<XxNightHawk64xX> SpadeMagnes[R: oh my someone has to make a fan hack call sonic 3cd and knuckles and knuckles
<SpadeMagnes[R> But trying to stay at 50 rings is the problem
<Bronysith> people trying to defend such a bad franchise, it is hilarious
<LadyCanary> Sith, dont try to create drama.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<SpadeMagnes[R> So do Sonic Colors and Generations mean nothing to you?
<cowvarkian> LadyCanary: but he does it so well
<LadyCanary> Seriously. As stupid as you may think it is, some people still like it.
<AJfan77> The chaos emeralds in that game are the hardest in series and i never madie it passed CE #4
<AJIsAwesome> Let's keep Bronystate classy, please.
<BaconMane> 0,5IM NT SONIC

<J_E_Smith71> Sonic & All Stars Racing is pretty fun
<AJIsAwesome> BaconMane: THESE NEW POPCORN NUGGETS ARE POPALICIOUS!
*muffled rap music playing in the distance
<XxNightHawk64xX> Bronysith: sonic is amazing. still i can understand why you think that because of shadot the hedgehog sonic 06 and the rest of the games in his dark age. but before and after that the games were fun as hell
<BaconMane> 0,5wat?
<SpadeMagnes[R> AJIsAwesome: Dont you mean papanutricious?
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[R actualy they're quite easy, but the requirement, yea...
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeMagnes[R: Indeed and the stpid SP Rings which you lose if you die so you have to go through the whole stage on one life
<AJIsAwesome> BaconMane: You didn't see that video he did of Sonic (the restaurant), did you?
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: NO!
<PonyStationVita> Hello everypony can you see my message through this ipad?
<BaconMane> 0,5nuh uh

<AJIsAwesome> BaconMane: That's what I was referencing.
<BaconMane> 0,5THESE CRYSTALS R POWRFUL
<PonyStationVita> so we talk about sonic
<SpadeMagnes[R> I made a joke too I just saw that
<cowvarkian> PonyStationVita: apparently we do
<AJfan77> Sonic 4 is an insult to the classics but Epispde 2 was a masterpiece
<XxNightHawk64xX> PonyStationVita: yup your good
<SpadeMagnes[R> Cheese the boss fight...
<SafariMonkey> So how can I get added to the bronystate 'clan' for PlanetSide 2?
<cowvarkian> XxNightHawk64xX: no, my good
<PonyStationVita> sonic 4 2 was good actually
<Deacon> AJfan77 it wasn't that bad, just differnet
<SpadeMagnes[R> Oh god Sonic 4 ep 1''s physics
<XxNightHawk64xX> AJfan77: i know right i still dont know why people hate sonic 4 ep 2. ya i understand there arguments but i still love it
<PonyStationVita> tails made the diffrence
<J_E_Smith71> Sonic games that bore me: Sonic Rivals 1 (sequel was more fun), Sonic Battle, parts of Sonic '06
<AJIsAwesome> I don't mind Sonic 4 Ep. 2. But do I find it Sonic 4? Not really. But it's a good game by itself.
<SpadeMagnes[R> You know whats a good Sonic game? Sonic Before The Sequel
<AJfan77> Deacon Not as bad as sonic genisis GBA but the physics dont exist
<SpadeMagnes[R> Its a fucking amazing fangame
<XxNightHawk64xX> the partner system made the game a bit too broken though
<J_E_Smith71> Three favorite games: S3&K, SA 1, Generations
<AJIsAwesome> I actually had a great time with Sonic Battle. :$
<XxNightHawk64xX> SpadeMagnes[R: ya it was. is after the sequel out yet
<PonyStationVita> inmmy opion colrs was my favorite plz no hate
<cowvarkian> You know whats a good sonic game? Any of the original 2d ones.
<AJIsAwesome> XxNightHawk64xX: The demo is.
<AJfan77> I love Sonic 2 with all my heart and will defend it to any extent
<XxNightHawk64xX> AJIsAwesome: CANT WAIT
<SpadeMagnes[R> Shadow the hedgehog was eh
<XxNightHawk64xX> you know wha speaking of fan games WHEN THE HELL IS FIGHTING IS MAGIC COMING OUT
<PonyStationVita> i think every 1 can agree sonic 06 was shit
<XxNightHawk64xX> I CANT WAT
<Deacon> XxNightHawk64xX when it comes out
<AJfan77> So how bout Sonic 4 Episode 3 do u guys think it should happen
<XxNightHawk64xX> PonyStationVita: dont even FUCKING remind me
<SpadeMagnes[R> The ending for Sonic 4 Ep2 sucked though
<PonyStationVita> i want knuckes on ep 3
<SpadeMagnes[R> It was such a letdown
<AJIsAwesome> AJfan77: Since Little Planet is still stuck inside the Death Egg, yes.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: The Strings That Make no Sound
<PonyStationVita> wow viewing on ipad is actually good
<SpadeMagnes[R> Maybe not, because unlike Ep 1 there is no To be continued screen
<SpadeMagnes[R> There is one unused in the coding though
<AJfan77> Sonic is my favorite video game franchise evr
<XxNightHawk64xX> AJfan77: i hope but you konw the fans. i just hope dimps listens to wha the fans say. ya they fixed the physics but still is it realy neccissary to have so many springs and speed boosterd
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: Until it comes out I just play Sonic The Fighters after that and pretend the Death Egg blows up there
<SpadeMagnes[R> Dimps loves their pits
<AJIsAwesome> And their speed boosters.
<AJfan77> Sonic 06 loves speed boosters
<SpadeMagnes[R> You how stupid the sonic fandom can be sometimes?
<PonyStationVita> O god notthe speed boasters
<XxNightHawk64xX> sonic advance 3 was when dimps started becoming... well... DIMPS
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, and don't forget the automated sections too.
<SpadeMagnes[R> When Sky sanctuary came out in generations
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[R as stupid as the brony fandom?
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: IT'S NOT YELLOW ENOUGH!
<SpadeMagnes[R> Sonic Retro whined it wasnt YELLOW enough
<SpadeMagnes[R> THE FUCK
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: I know, right. :S
<XxNightHawk64xX> SpadeMagnes[R: i know seriously sonic sucks because of his eye color.......WTF

<BaconMane> 0,5jeez
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: I know that, but I just don't know why people complain about the eyes of all things.

<Jageman> Schedual conflict, i will not be going to the family Thanksgiving party today.
<AJIsAwesome> BaconMane: "Yes, yes!" -M. Bison

<SpadeMagnes[R> Theres this one wall in Classic Seaside hill, if you bounce over it with the bubble shield, the next section of the level doesnt load
<PonyStationVita> but in my opioon sonic generation 3ds>sonic 06
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: I've seen people complain about the eyes because"His pupil is too small!"
<SpadeMagnes[R> The coding is still there, just not the graphics

<PonyStationVita> yay
<SpadeMagnes[R> Also I love using Classic homing attack
<SpadeMagnes[R> It breaks all the level design
<AJfan77> I'm wearing a classic sonic shirt right now
*Jageman wants to cry, but tries to use logic to remind self that emotions are meaningless.
<J_E_Smith71> XxNightHawk64xX: His model looked weird in '0 but it looked better in later games
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: Oh, I remember all the rage when people discovered that skill.
<J_E_Smith71> '06
<PonyStationVita> i thought u can only domthat on 3ds version
<cowvarkian> Jageman: good job
<LadyCanary> ....
<J_E_Smith71> PonyStationVita: It's a Red Ring reward in the HD version
*LadyCanary facedesks
<SpadeMagnes[R> PonyStationVita: No in the 360/pc version you get it by getting all the red rings as classic sonic i think

<SpadeMagnes[R> Also I think they make a joke about how Unleashed was boost to win
<PonyStationVita> sonic and that 80s cartoon had 5
<AJfan77> they did
<SpadeMagnes[R> They put in an ability that gives you infinite boost
<SpadeMagnes[R> But your a one hit wonder doing so

<AJIsAwesome> XxNightHawk64xX: That was a good show.

<Snow|Drawing> PonyStationVita: but but...what about shadow? D:

<ekips> Invi strange, then you have to go with Prosieben.Sat1 it seems :P
<XxNightHawk64xX> Wrek: which sonic game for all we know it could of been 06
<J_E_Smith71> Wrek: Which ones? The original Genesis ones?
<Invi> ekips, but.. bäääh ^^
<SpadeMagnes[R> Wrek: I respect opinions, regarding they are valid complaints
<AJfan77> I loled when there was a G3 pimkie pie referance
<pony_4442> what is bieng streamed?
<PonyStationVita> i liked the lyra refernce
<AJIsAwesome> It's fine if people don't like things. But please don't discourage the people who like it ( for everyone in general). :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> pony_4442: Planet side 2 :)
<cratorkid> pony_4442: wrek playing some planetside
<AJIsAwesome> pony_4442: PLanetside 2.
<ekips> Invi should've made a beta account, would've gotten a nice decal too :P
<pony_4442> ty
<AJIsAwesome> No problem. :)
<XxNightHawk64xX> AJIsAwesome: i know but they have to play it before they can make a full opinion on it. its the same thing with brony haters
<PonyStationVita> wow a pistol hmm
<Invi> ekips, i didn't even know that game exsisted since yesterday ^^
<ekips> Invi and 500 free station cash :P
<SpadeMagnes[R> But god damn I hated Big the Cat
<XxNightHawk64xX> Wrek: seriously which sonic games did you play
<J_E_Smith71> I think Sonic must have been the first videogame that I was hooked by the cartoons first
<AJIsAwesome> WHERE'S MY FROGGY?
<SpadeMagnes[R> My mind was blown when I found out Duke Nukem voiced Big
<Wrek> 05XxNightHawk64xX: Srsly what metal did you lsiten to?
<SpadeMagnes[R> I was like what the fuck
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: :D
<PonyStationVita> big is also voiced by that guy from duke nukem
<ekips> Invi wow, you missed a few streams haven't you? ^^
<Wrek> 05im proving a point, stop beign uptight
<AJfan77> i thought Big was ok i didnt mind him because he didnt have many lvls
<Shizuka> 13Wrek: copper
<AJIsAwesome> As a fishing mechanic, he's "okay". But does he have to be in a "Sonic" game?
<XxNightHawk64xX> Wrek: the ones that were just playing and i dont like it. now that i said that tell me which sonic games did you play
<PonyStationVita> the fishing lvl froogy where r u
<XxNightHawk64xX> AJIsAwesome: ikr
<SpadeMagnes[R> They apperently made big because they wanted a character who didnt have to go fast all the time
<SpadeMagnes[R> That or to advertise sega bass fishing...
<AJfan77> He can easily jump in the water and grab him
<Invi> ekips, i saw that game here but uuuh *shrugs
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<PonyStationVita> i think colrs did a good job on jokes but a bad job on lack of variet on characters
<AJIsAwesome> He could also cage the frog so that he would never get away.
*LadyCanary likes this song~
<ekips> Invi ?
<SpadeMagnes[R> Who voiced Robotnik in the sonic cartoon?
<J_E_Smith71> Well Wrek I think he's asking because he's probably seeing if you only played the ones that everyone thinks sucks, or if you played the classic ones that are considered good (Like Sonic 3 & Knuckles which is the best in the series)? If you think the originals suck that's fine, but maybe they think you're judging it on the later games that sucked
<Invi> ekips?
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeMagnes[R: Which ones?
<PonyStationVita> yay
<SpadeMagnes[R> The Adventure of sonic the hedgehog one
<XxNightHawk64xX> Wrek: im not being stubborn i just want to know what sonic game you played cause if you played a bad one then you dont really have a good opinion till you play the good ones. if you played the good ones then i wont understand you but ill respect your opinion
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> happy thanksgiving everypony :)
<Wrek> 05i dont know why he keeps askign as i told him i was provign a point
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeMagnes[R: Long John Bradly
<AJIsAwesome> Happy Thanksgiving, Sketch_Toku_Brony. :)
<ekips> Invi I meant: Please provide more detail concerning your last statement :P
<SpadeMagnes[R> Im not sure which robotnik it was but I remember one of this is the same voice actor for Pooh Bear
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: :D
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeMagnes[R: SatAM it was Jim Cummings
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: I hope that that's the AOSTH one. :D
<LadyCanary> Sabaton, Sabaton~
<Invi> ekips, neither did i know what was played not that it was free and i also didn't care about it because i thought it was another expensive thingy gamy stuff ^^
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: Nope it was SatAM
<PonyStationVita> any 1 think the sonic racing game released a few days agonis a rip off of mario kart 7
<Invi> *nore
<Invi> *nor so
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/R7VRT.gif forget turkey let's have some beef
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: That's even better. :D
<XxNightHawk64xX> Wrek: look im gonna shut up but just play a good sonic game and then come back and tell me you dont like it and youll have a good opinion and statement
<ekips> Invi that's why you always ask the holy question "What is on stream?"
<LadyCanary> D: Poor cow, Shizu
<AJIsAwesome> I never liked turkey.
<J_E_Smith71> PonyStationVita: Even so it has some really good track design
<PonyStationVita> hmm true
<Invi> ekips, well... meh ^^
<SpadeMagnes[R> Its kind of a stupid argument to say one racing game is a rip off of a nother one
<XxNightHawk64xX> Wrek: and play it with an open mind or your no better than a brony hater. k just try them
<Naughtymare> Mario kart double dash <3
<alexxm> all racing games seem similar to me
<PonyStationVita> does any 1 have the mlp app for ipad i need scootaloo for hearts
<SpadeMagnes[R> I hated double dash
<AJIsAwesome> I loved Double Dash.
<SpadeMagnes[R> I always had to play with koopa to use triple shells
<AJfan77> how many rainbow roads have there been
<AJIsAwesome> AJfan77: Depends. How many MK games have been made?
<SpadeMagnes[R> 7
<J_E_Smith71> Anyways I got into Sonic when I saw the promotional comic for the first game. I wanted it but I already had a NES & SNES and my parents thought that was enough
<PonyStationVita> according to mario kart 7
<SpadeMagnes[R> I never played super mario kart but I remember the AI being super dickish in that game
<AJfan77> there was even one is Sonic R and one in FZero GX
<AJIsAwesome> I hope they're counting the MK GP ones.
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: DOn't bother. That game's INCREDIBLY hard to win.
<AJIsAwesome> *Don't
<J_E_Smith71> But when the comics and cartoon came out I latched on to them and they saw I was getting into Sonic so they finally got me a Genesis that Christmas
<PonyStationVita> hey if any one wants to friend me on the mlp app game on ipad type in my name and i will give you my gifts evryday.
<J_E_Smith71> Funny enough I never had Sonic 1 until the Mega Collection came out
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<XxNightHawk64xX> anyone ever meet a brony hater in real life
<J_E_Smith71> You too AJIsAwesome?
<SpadeMagnes[R> On a entirely different topic, I fucking love reading Dwarf Fortress forum playthroughs
<alexxm> J_E_Smith71 same here the first few sonic games were before my time
<AJIsAwesome> I grew up with Sonic 2 (even though I can't remember it), and I played the Sonic 3+ Knuckles CD.
<Wrek> 05I dont take kindly on you calling me a brony hater man, thats low.
<SpadeMagnes[R> <.< Oh jesus....
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353562264495.jpg
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: He's talking specifically to you?
<AJfan77> Sonic 3 CD & Knuckles & Knuckles
<XxNightHawk64xX> Wrek: i never did call you that
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: Yep. :)
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVED Mega Collection.
<Wrek> 05so by your logic i can tell you to lsiten to some proper metal and if you dont you are no better than a hater? tsk tsk
<Wrek> 05just go sit in the corner and chew on something
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe we all need to calm down....
<J_E_Smith71> alexxm: Funny enough I was around when it came out but for some reason my parents never got it for me, even though it was released
<SpadeMagnes[R> Also on a entirely different topic, Disney is putting a starbucks in the Magic Kingdom
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeMagnes[R: Already one at DCA
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: inb4 Disney themed drinks.
<killerpony7733> Pssst thats the que to calm down
<alexxm> J_E_Smith71 did you have the sega consle?
<SpadeMagnes[R> The problem I have with it is their replaceing the mainstreet bakery with the starbucks
<AJIsAwesome> I still have the Genesis controller, but not the console.
<SpadeMagnes[R> I loved the bakery
<J_E_Smith71> alexxm: Yep had a Genesis, had all the Sonic games except for Sonic 1
<PonyStationVita> never owned a sega consloe
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeMagnes[R: Yeah would have been fine if they just added Starbucks drinks
<SpadeMagnes[R> Did megacolelction have Sonic 3 and K?
<Bronysith> i want a Dreamcast
<AJIsAwesome> I was very close to buying Sonic 2 Genesis at a Blockbuster as a kid, but I didn't have a Genesis. :<
<Bronysith> actually no i dont, i just appreciate what the dreamcast did
<AJIsAwesome> I remember when I rented a Dreamcast and SA with it.
<Shizuka> 13if you don't listen to bronze you are not a metal fan
<SpadeMagnes[R> I found it stupid Sonic's ultimate Genesis collection didnt have Sonic 3 and Knuckles
<PonyStationVita> is nintendo why sega stppoed making consloes
<SpadeMagnes[R> They had a bullshit reason for it
<SpadeMagnes[R> No disc space
<AJIsAwesome> You know, when they would allow you to RENT CONSOLES.
<Bronysith> god, all the 4th wall breaking in animaniacs
<SpadeMagnes[R> Then later they release the thing with Sonic 3 and Knuckles on it! as a special edition!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome: lol reminds me of that video on YT where the guys sleeping and his phone rings,he pick up everything BUT the phone lol picks up a Genesis "Hello? F:[K!" then pick a banana does the same thing then a BUNDLE of bananas :D
<SpadeMagnes[R> Its one thing to not put shit in a game, but when you make up bullshit excuses its worse
<AJIsAwesome> I never got past Windy Valley as a kid.
<PonyStationVita> genesis does what nindont any1 no that commercial
<AJfan77> i do
<PonyStationVita> i saw avgns paradody of it so funny
<Bronysith> Super nintendo>gennesis

<AJIsAwesome> BLAST PROCESSING!
<SpadeMagnes[R> Also what the hell is Blast Processing?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man they need to make game commercials like the ones from the 80's to 90's :D
<MadSurge> And I'm back from swimming! :$
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: It doesn't do anything, it's something they came up with to help with sales.
<cratorkid> AJIsAwesome: :) think i will go watch that again once the stream ends :P

<J_E_Smith71> PonyStationVita: Not really he did a Sonic video where he talked about his memories from playing the classic ones

<SpadeMagnes[R> Also Pikachu losing to a newbie snivy was bullshit
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: And that could've been the chance where they could've shifted to another character.
<Turkey_icybeauti> Well, in technical terms he didn't. He only does in the movies.
<cratorkid> did anybody else read the creepy pasta about ash?
<SpadeMagnes[R> Pikachu has fought LEGENDARIES AND EVERYTHING

<pony_3636> One last comment before I leave.
<pony_3636> Gak
<SpadeMagnes[R> also you know what they edited a rice ball rolling down a hill into?
<MadSurge> Invi: the whole Psychic class was bugged up the ass in Gen1 :D
<Alchemist> This seems to be a great movie. I might vote for it in the next lottery :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2LUssy5lwA
<SpadeMagnes[R> A fuckign sub sandwich
<Invi> MadSurge, and many more funny wunny bugs ^^
<AJfan77> g :[ k
<Invi> MadSurge, Missingno. ^^
<SpadeMagnes[R> Pin missile was the shit in gen one
<AJIsAwesome> Does that script still work?
<Wrek> 05there we go
<SpadeMagnes[R> Give it to Jolteon and you rape everything
<Invi> where we go?
<AJIsAwesome> GAH, Jolteon.
<Wrek> 05hmm
<MadSurge> Invi: I'm glad that Gen 5 made all classes liable to get through the game with :)
<cratorkid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oER05_nm0B8
<Wrek> 05maybe some...
<SpadeMagnes[R> Wasnt critical hits based by speed in gen one?
<AJIsAwesome> One of the most broken Pokemon in the game.
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: That and some other factor, I think.
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: not anymore :D
<Invi> MadSurge, isn't gen5 that black/white stuff?
<SpadeMagnes[R> So Jolteon always murdered everything
<SafariMonkey> What's the bronystate squad in PS2?
<MadSurge> Invi: yep
<Invi> ah okay. can't talk about that since i never played it MadSurge ^^
<SpadeMagnes[R> Stat wise I find White Kyurem better than Black Kyurem
<killerpony7733> SafariMonkey NLP and actually go ingame and add wrek
<SpadeMagnes[R> Its move set is more special than physical base
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: Well, Reshiram has always been more useful than Zekrom.
<killerpony7733> SafariMonkey If you can do that wrek can invite you to the outfit
<MadSurge> Invi: they made bugs cool and you can't import nor catch old gen mons until you're done with the story :)
<SafariMonkey> What's wrek's name? is it wrek?
<SpadeMagnes[R> The kyurem fusion has a lack of physical moves which Black kyurem can use
<SpadeMagnes[R> But its loaded with special ones
<AJIsAwesome> I still wish Electric move's power was boosted in the rain.
<SpadeMagnes[R> I still cant get over how less animated White Kyurem looks compared to Black
<AJIsAwesome> That way it could compete with Fire +Sunny Day.
<Wrek> 05my computer is still a bit unstable
<Wrek> 05but its better than yesterday
<AJIsAwesome> Take your time, Wrek. :)
<Wrek> 05good to see the cleaning helped

<DinkyDoo> OMG I LOVE COLRESS BATTLE THEME!!!!!
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: not yet
<AJIsAwesome> I see it on the HUB from time to time.
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: I thought they did
<Bronysith> Animaniacs and Batman TAS are the two best animated shows ever
<AJIsAwesome> It's usually on certain days or late at nights.
<Bronysith> One for comedy adn the other for just pure epicness
<SpadeMagnes[R> I was more a Pinkie and the Brain kind of guy
<AJIsAwesome> The last episode I saw of that on the HUB was the Mr. Freeze backstory episode.
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[R: thats animaniacs

<cowvarkian> <.< why was he riding with mongols
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: Tibetans IIRC
<MadSurge> Shaolin monks!
<Bronysith> Xiaolin monks?
<Kencolt> Actually, axes cut you anywhere. It's kind of what they were first made for.
<AJIsAwesome> I never saw Jack's legs in that scene, so I thought he was secretly part centaur. :D
<Dark92Enigma> Or Mongols*
<Wrek> 05i think the style has ages very well
<Bronysith> Shaolin*
<Wrek> 05very seldom it uses outliens
<Wrek> 05which is a feat
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: point taken
<LadyCanary> Indeed Wrek.
<cowvarkian> this sortof shits on any type of historical accuract though...
<MadSurge> I like the style of this cartoon either way <3
<Bronysith> this is much better than a typical "20 years later"
<taoumi> oh saurai jack
<LadyCanary> ....AWWW!
<cowvarkian> but meh, its a cartoon
<Dark92Enigma> Wrek is right, the animation aged well with the time
<LadyCanary> It's his mom :3333
<Kencolt> cowvarkian: It was never meant to be "historically accdurate".
<cratorkid> d'aww
<cowvarkian> Kencolt: yeah, I know
<MadSurge> Mommy!
<Dark92Enigma> <3 MAMA
<cowvarkian> I'm just being nitpicky
<Bronysith> So much storytelling, and not a single word is spoken, so awesome
<MadSurge> ^
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<AdamTheDuck> ^^^
<XxNightHawk64xX> sup guys

<LadyCanary> How exciting >w<
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<Kandarihu> I can tell you one thing, early One Piece hasn't aged well. The production values have gotten gradually better over time, and looking at the first episodes over the latest ones is painful
<MadSurge> Hey DerpyMuffins!
<Sonny> hi DerpyMuffins
<Wrek> 05that tinkling sound is the strikign of pickaxes btw
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai DerpyMuffins
<alexxm> how've you been DerpyMuffins

<Kandarihu> cratorkid, I still recommend it. Just be prepared to pace yourself on it. It's Loooooong
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu: true, but several animes started that way. One Piece akes forever though
<Bronysith> MadSurge: that dont count
<Bronysith> NINJAS
<Dark92Enigma> BREAK= First word......d'aaaaaaaaawww they're learning so fast :'(

<Bronysith> HOLY SHIT
<twilight_sprinkle> he looks so weird here
<DerpyMuffins> This is the season finally?
<Bronysith> and he is actually holding the sword correctly
<LadyCanary> His poor father...
<Bronysith> having the blade facing up is the right way to hold the sword in its scabbard
<Dark92Enigma> DerpyMuffins: nope, the very first episode
<cratorkid> hahahaha
<DerpyMuffins> Old man words
<twilight_sprinkle> horse
<Dark92Enigma> PONY

<twilight_sprinkle> that horse was wise
<Sonny> yup
<cowvarkian> spoiler: evil finds a way
<Sonny> to late

<Sonny> damn that was awesome
<cowvarkian> spoiler: he is not so fortunate
<Sonny> <3
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Afflict> you too
<DerpyMuffins> Was this ever properly ended?
<Dark92Enigma> BRAVO! BRAVO! BRAVO! :)
<Sonny> cowvarkian: you're comming in late xD
<LadyCanary> No DerpyMuffins
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: Nope.
<cowvarkian> Sonny: I know
<Sonny> lol
<Dark92Enigma> DerpyMuffins: to this day....nope
<LadyCanary> The creator is still working on the finale I believe.
<MadSurge> DerpyMuffins: not yet unfortunately :(
<DerpyMuffins> Pity
<LadyCanary> He's had a lot on his plate lately, though.
<Bronysith> that sound bite
<DerpyMuffins> I would love to have see the end
<Dark92Enigma> LadyCanary: he is, when i found out something else (PM you later)
<cowvarkian> Sonny: I'm not actually trying to spoil things
<LadyCanary> Cool.
<cowvarkian> I'm being facetious
<Dark92Enigma> I LOVE THIS INTRO
<Invi> I like how he speaks ^^
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Bronysith> Invi: of course you do, its Mako
<MadSurge> Where my evil is LAW
<Wrek> 05all yoru faces when i have all the original episodes of tom and jerry
<LadyCanary> :d
<Invi> first episode of that show i ever see
<Wrek> 05even the pilot back in the 60's
<cowvarkian> hmm
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: YES.
<MadSurge> Wrek YESH
<AJIsAwesome> Thank you, Wrek.
<Buytoast> ah, Samuroo jackoo
<LadyCanary> Ah Tom & Jerry. Good ol fashioned cartoon violence.
<MadSurge> Wrek: I saw the pilot! When Tom was still Jasper :D
<Invi> the original episodes of Tom and jerry still air on a childrens channel here
<LadyCanary> Good for the kiddies.
<Wrek> 05MadSurge: aye :P
<twilight_sprinkle> not a fan of tom and jerry myself
<XxNightHawk64xX> not gonna lie i used to love this show but the more i watch it know it does seem to age a little bit badly. dont get me wrong its still good but idk
<twilight_sprinkle> i wanted the cat to win ;~;
<LadyCanary> ....
<LadyCanary> XxNightHawk64xX: That doesnt make any sense.
<cowvarkian> it seems to have aged fine to me...
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: He won sometimes.
<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle: he does sometimes
<cowvarkian> but I like 2d things
<LadyCanary> It aged just fine.
<twilight_sprinkle> rarely tho
<Bronysith> FREE
<Bronysith> FREEFALLING
<DerpyMuffins> Dat face
<cowvarkian> and somehow survives
<Bronysith> WHAM
<XxNightHawk64xX> LadyCanary: i liked the show al lot as a kid, i still do now, but not as much because it hasnt aged that well the more i look back on it
<Invi> i hope he wears underwear...
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: It's usually becuse Tom is the one starting things.
<cowvarkian> I think that jack is made of antimatter
*LadyCanary facedesks
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: exactly
<ScootaChicken> Why is mama facedesking ;_;
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: stop startin'! but idk, imo a mouse tha steals food is the one that starts
<LadyCanary> Because people are being ignorant.
<Wrek> 05dont worry LadyCanary
<Wrek> 05the twat speaks out of his ass
<DerpyMuffins> I remember Jack trolling Aku
<Bronysith> now that i think about it, this show aged just fine
<MadSurge> ^
<ScootaChicken> Mama and Dada!
<twilight_sprinkle> oh my god, somoene with a different opinion? what a prick, lets ban him
<Buytoast> do people actually think Tom usually started the shit?
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: ikr
<Bronysith> i mean, look at teh animation, it is awesome
<Buytoast> because Jerry was the real asshole of the show
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<Kammerjunk> Buytoast: Jerry was obviously the real villain.
<ScootaChicken> To be honest, it would be a bad day if BronyState started banning pricks.
<XxNightHawk64xX> Wrek: dude shut the fuck up says the guy who hates sonic and samuri jack without even a full true formed opinion come on calm down
<DerpyMuffins> Dat talk
<Wrek> 05PRODIGIOUS!
<MadSurge> Buytoast: most of the time yes :D
<cowvarkian> ScootaChicken: wait, we don't do that?
<ScootaChicken> We'd lose such valuable members of the community, like twilight_sprinkle.
<DerpyMuffins> I don't understand a single word
<Bronysith> Dafuq?
<MadSurge> RADICAL
<MadSurge> GROOVALICIOUS
<twilight_sprinkle> ScootaChicken: lawl.
<Bronysith> Why is he wearing a lava lamp on his head?
<Kammerjunk> DerpyMuffins: I think they're discussing the weather.
<J_E_Smith71> Ans that's how he got his name
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Why not?
<Bronysith> come to think of it, why am i not wearing a lava lamp on my head?
<twilight_sprinkle> anyway i g2g,bye

<cowvarkian> J_E_Smith71: aku owns everything, one would think
<MadSurge> Bronysith: yeah basically
<Dark92Enigma> GOOD ONE JACK!
<ScootaChicken> Kammerjunk: You've caught the stupid from mane chat.
<Dark92Enigma> too late
<Kencolt> Invi: They don't. In fact, his "real" name is never stated... they're just the kind of people who call people "jack".
<XxNightHawk64xX> Wrek: look we got off on the wrong foot how about we just put our differences aside and forget this all happened. after all isnt the poin of mlp to ove and tolerate no matter their differences. what d'ya saw man. truths?
<Bronysith> Refresh myself? "buffering" oh shit,
<MadSurge> cowvarkian: there will always be resistance
<Buytoast> 'With the new Wii AkU, slaughter many with the power of darkness and the fury of an angry god."

<Lasharus> Oh yes. Happy thanksgiving to everyone who celebrates it.
<Buytoast> everything is terrible
<ScootaChicken> Actually, haven't seen most of you in a while.
<Dark92Enigma> Lasharus: Oh, ok, Suburban Commando, Christopher Lloyd himself said to Hulk Hogan of all people: ''CHRIST, I WAS FROZEN TODAY!'' as a comeback quote
<Lasharus> Oh, I'm on the chat, ScootaChicken. I'm just a little less talkative of late.
<Dark92Enigma> Lasharus: best. comeback. EVER
<Lasharus> Ah. My knowledge of Suburban Commando is microscopically tiny.
<Kandarihu> Yeah, stream died all of a sudden
<Lasharus> It WAS non-existant, but now I know this little factoid about it.
<ScootaChicken> Lasharus: Oh no, it's more to do with the fact that this is the first time I've logged onto mane chat in a couple months, ahaha.
<Lasharus> That'll work as well, ScootaChicken. :P
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: because he's Christopher Lloyd. JUDGE DOOM, baby!
<LadyCanary> Did the stream die?
<Dark92Enigma> Lasharus: it's ok, bro
<Kandarihu> So, is the Macy's Day Parade over?
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: i beleive so
<Meanwhile> >Arrive
<AJIsAwesome> I think so, Canary.
<Meanwhile> >Apparently stream died
<MadSurge> LadyCanary: unforunately yes :(
<Kandarihu> LadyCanary, yeah. Stream's dead
<ScootaChicken> String_Shredder: It will never be as good as Indian Stallone.
<Dark92Enigma> stream is ded.........NO BIG SURPRISE
<Meanwhile> >everything I touch dies.mp4
<Kammerjunk> Lasharus: It featured that wrestler nobody but MTV cares about anymore. He thinks Afterburner is a game about aliens.
<LadyCanary> XD
<ScootaChicken> That was the greatest buffer moment BronyState has ever had.
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: except your mustache
<Yahooz> String_Shredder: http://i.imgur.com/QQrwU.jpg best i can do
<MaxTheBrony> Heya
<String_Shredder> ScootaChicken: Boom boom robada
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: he shaved
<Lasharus> Put it this way Dark92Enigma - if you use a Robotnik/Eggman quote on me, I'll immediately recognise it. Same for a quote from Discworld.
<MadSurge> Hello Meanwhile *hugs and lives*
<Lasharus> Many other things, not so much.
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: huh
<cowvarkian> then everything he touches does die
<Meanwhile> Well, hi everyone. What was on before it apparently died?
<MadSurge> Yahooz: pretty good actually :D
<MaxTheBrony> Heya guys :)

<MadSurge> Lasharus: how many pounds of ham?
<Kammerjunk> wat
<Yahooz> ScootaChicken: not really
<cowvarkian> are you a god, ScootaChicken
<Yahooz> and its more like Descension
<ScootaChicken> I can see that cowvarkian isn't.
<cowvarkian> ._.
<ScootaChicken> Yahooz: Stop turning into Dermathil.
<Dark92Enigma> OK, gotta dash everypony.....but if i have to review the series, i would give it 10/10
<Bronysith> why did he eat the entire milkshake? cup and all
<Yahooz> ScootaChicken: but its so... gah
<MadSurge> Bye Dark92Enigma :P
<ScootaChicken> Yahooz: There's nothing wrong with our little group :<
<Kammerjunk> ScootaChicken: Is Dermathil even around at the moment?
<Yahooz> ScootaChicken: except everything
<XxNightHawk64xX> wait wrek got off thats why theres no stream well he was on for about 7-8 hours so he should take a break
*cowvarkian feels excluded
<ScootaChicken> Kammerjunk: I don't know, and I don't particularly care either.
<ScootaChicken> Yahooz: Why you still in it then :P
<Kammerjunk> Fair 'nuff.
<DerpyMuffins> Did Wrek disconnect again?
<Yahooz> Derm doesnt come in anmore

<AnkanoMachine> poor guy
<Michael> mentlegen
<Rose`> bitch shut up, no ones listens to a pink helmet
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: there's a lot of implied deaths though
<MadSurge> Shut up Spongebob

<DemoPegono> Ahhh.... Thanksgiving is awesoe...
<Rose`> Mr.Science?

<Kandarihu> MadSurge, a million is a statistic. The only reason Jack was sent to the future to fight robots is to AVOID violence where living beings can come to harm.

<scout19_tf2|2> he can fly
<aniderp> zoom zooooom
<Rose`> what happened to jump good?
<Meanwhile> Who needs to jump good when you have a rocket pack.
<Wrek> 05BUZZ LIGHTYEAR

<Kencolt> He can't jump THAT good...
<alexxm> he's adapting well
<AJIsAwesome> AND BEYOND!
<DinkyDoo> AND BEYOND
<Meanwhile> To infinity and then a bit more.
<Rose`> luke
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, the skill to jump good could still come in handy, even with this.
<scout19_tf2|2> dem star wars drones
<Rose`> you must learn to use the force
<scout19_tf2|2> use da force jack
<Michael> party hard
<Rose`> why was that guy talking on teh stairs?

*DemoPegono uses the opposite of the force... uses friction
<conami> rings are lame...

<conami> i thought that sends you forward
<pony_3636> up up up!
<Kandarihu> I heard "This theory is very sound" in the crowd
<pony_3636> here's a secret "gaps"
<Meanwhile> The escape pod is a tree, your argument is invalid.
<RaveBrony> :L
<AJIsAwesome> Wait. If Jack goes back into the past and defeats Aku, wouldn't all his expieriences in the future cease to exist?
<pony_3636> "I'd like to be a tree"
<Michael> i <3 science :D
<AJIsAwesome> *experiences
<DemoPegono> [SLURRED] Why don't we BLOW up the recreation of the Empire State building in Los Angeles.

<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: I don't even know what the synopsis of this episode is! :$
<oni_link> nuuu ;~;
<Sumica> 00,10oh no LadyCanary

<Jageman> MadSurge: if you cut it in half, it can not crush the core on all sides. instead of a nuke you get a dirty bomb
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But...but...

<Wrek> 05PengWin: I KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE!
<Wrek> 05<3

<MadSurge> Jageman: so a slightly more powerful bomb?

<CyberTheDjPony> this is not dubstep
<Kandarihu> I remember when I was waiting for the last 2 episodes of Madoka Magica to air, Chihiro made an April Fools release purporting to be episode 11. Instead it was the finale of Lilpri with dirty joke-subs... in the rune font from Madoka Magica
<Jageman> MadSurge: nuclear weapons are kinda sensitive.
<AJIsAwesome> ^ twilight_sprinkle
<oni_link> This is like straight up techno iirc
<chairmen21> i always knew raving would evolve in to complete a holes destroying stuff
<CyberTheDjPony> KILL THEM JACK!!

<MadSurge> Jageman: like nuclear centrals?
<LadyCanary> ....Aw :(
<AJIsAwesome> :<
<PonyBean> oots oots oots oots
<Jageman> MadSurge: if you mess up the first stage explosion, it will not work as well
<Kandarihu> This isn't dubstep.

<String_Shredder> unts unts unts unts unts
<spitfirecolt> where did that air on kandi
<MadSurge> Jageman: hmmhmm

<JamesClydesdale> Yes it is dubstep :c
<CyberTheDjPony> and a raise
<oni_link> Its not damnit
<thelonepony> ./)_-
<String_Shredder> So that's what downtown Durham is like at night...
<PonyBean> this was way before dubstep
<Meanwhile> Can't be dubstep, hearing it doesn't make me want to stab myself in the ears.
<JamesClydesdale> Poor guy
<CrystalPhoenix> JamesClydesdale, no it aint
<LadyCanary> So it's techno music.
<TrixieTheMagnificent> confusing electronic with dubstep ...
<CyberTheDjPony> that was techno
<Kandarihu> spitfirecolt, I'm not sure about Lilpri, but the end of Madoka Magica was delayed for 6 weeks due to the Sendai Earthquake.
<Pika-Picho> i'm not used to music
<AJIsAwesome> In fact, I don't even think dubstep even existed before this.
<LadyCanary> And those kids were Zombie Ravers.
<Jageman> MadSurge: I do know that if you mess up bad enough, none of the core material will undergo fission, making the bomb almost useless.
<oni_link> Its techno
<Alchemist> Im not sure dubstep even existed at this time.
<Pika-Picho> His hair looks like a girl.
<spitfirecolt> where u live at kandi
<AJIsAwesome> Alchemist: It didn't.
<pony_8845> anyone getting a buffer?
<Jageman> MadSurge: cutting it in half would do that
<twilight_sprinkle> my little girl, techno is evil magic
<Dark_Horst> no buffer here
<String_Shredder> That's a weird looking 45 record...
<AJIsAwesome> pony_8845: Every now and then.
<oni_link> This was when the rave scene was still mainstream
<MadSurge> Jageman: so it's easy to defuse them :D
<JamesClydesdale> I AM SOOOO ded
<Kandarihu> Dubstep existed when this was made, but had yet to catch on on the internet
<chairmen21> well they werent go at predicting the i pod
<Jageman> MadSurge: but the radioactive material would get out.
<Alchemist> oni_link: maybe a bit later
<spitfirecolt> never heard of that show in the us
<CyberTheDjPony> TECHNO KILLS SO KILL IT BEFORE IT KILLS YOU!!
<Pika-Picho> MY LITTLE PONEH
<CyberTheDjPony> (/
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Ah, okay. I still wouldn't consider this dubstep, though.
<Alchemist> oni_link: I think it was at its peak in the mid 90s.
<Jageman> MadSurge: cutting the bomb in half would ruin the shielding
<JamesClydesdale> I BETCHOO NO ONE HAR IS A BRONEH!
<twilight_sprinkle> dj-pon3 is evill, send her to the sun
<MadSurge> Jageman: still, concentrated in one spot

<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: damm it, just when i had a chance to review the first three Samurai Jack episodes

<CCCP> scout19_tf2 *hugs* (\
<Zacklego> F*ck this game
<AJIsAwesome> We really shouldnt judge each other based on people's opinions and characteristics. :S
<thelonepony> ^
<DoctoDoctorWho> spitfirecolt: I may play the game someday, I am aquiring muneez.
<CrystalPhoenix> hey guys....
<AJIsAwesome> Yes/
<thelonepony> yeah?
<AJIsAwesome> *.
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: isn't that how we judge eachother?
<scout19_tf2> CCCP: *hugs back*
<CrystalPhoenix> is it wrong to have fun in Nintendo Land?
<AJIsAwesome> Nope.
<thelonepony> naw
<CrystalPhoenix> cause seriously
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hey thelonepony
<CrystalPhoenix> I wuv that game
<CrystalPhoenix> <3
<thelonepony> Hi DoctoDoctorWho :)
<AJIsAwesome> cowvarkian: Ah, re-read my sentence. Sorry about that.
<alexxm> the hell is nintendo land
<AJIsAwesome> Let me rephrase.
<spitfirecolt> i never seen a game cost so much u have to build a board buy the army books and scenery just to play
<DashWithRainbows> AJIsAwesome Dat's cool and all but you think AJ is awesome. I dislike that very much so I'm judging you on your opinions so I dislike you now.
<DashWithRainbows> :3
<DoctoDoctorWho> thelonepony: Thanks for keeping a lookout, :)
<AJIsAwesome> We really shouldnt judge each other. People have their opinions and characteristics.
<thelonepony> you're welcome:)
<AJIsAwesome> DashWithRainbows: I love you too DWR.
<CrystalPhoenix> but
<CrystalPhoenix> I'm
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: but anyway i left rating the series 10/10. With an animation style way ahead of it's time, charismatic and influential characters, and a thrilling mythology of it's own, Samurai Jack still holds up to this day
<DashWithRainbows> Ew, gay.
<CrystalPhoenix> very disapointed in Paper Mario Sticker Stars
<aniderp> i was like im so tempted to put this in your cart(amazon) and she said go ahead :>
<CCCP> Hi DashWithRainbows! *hugs*
<headhunter> hi people
<DashWithRainbows> Ohai See-See-See-Pee.
<Dark92Enigma> hi DashWithRainbows!
<DashWithRainbows> And hey to you, Dark92Enigma.
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry for the misinterpretation, cowvarkian.
<headhunter> hi, im hunter
<AJIsAwesome> Hello, headhunter.
<Dark92Enigma> no opinion on my review..........i forgot the kickass soundtrack and intense battles
<CrystalPhoenix> but seriously
<CrystalPhoenix> Paper Mario Sticker Star is......very very different
<headhunter> wacha chatin aout?
<AJIsAwesome> Sticker Star.
<CrystalPhoenix> It completely changed the formula of the game
<thelonepony> CrystalPhoenix: no rpg element?
<CrystalPhoenix> removing the charm in it
<CrystalPhoenix> thelonepony, VERY VERY few RPG elements
<AJIsAwesome> There isn't really a reason to battle any enemies in the game, IMO.
<CrystalPhoenix> no level up upgrades
<Deacon> that reminds me, I should get super paper mario sometine
<CrystalPhoenix> no badge points
<CrystalPhoenix> no FP points
<J_E_Smith71> thelonepony: You have finite attack uses and you run out your screwed
<AJIsAwesome> You collect stickers to use in battle, and they're gone once you use them.
<CrystalPhoenix> yeah
<J_E_Smith71> Only thing that goes up is HP
<J_E_Smith71> You have no partners either
<CrystalPhoenix> and that's an item
<spitfirecolt> sticker star is that a console game
<CrystalPhoenix> 3dsa
<AJIsAwesome> You get coins in battle, but what do you use them on? More stickers.
<CrystalPhoenix> 3ds**
<CrystalPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, and roulette
<CrystalPhoenix> also
<DoctoDoctorWho> spitfirecolt: so how much 40k lore are you familiar with?
<CrystalPhoenix> STAGES
<otakon> bah sounds like a bad Paper Mario RPG
<VenHur> I'm back.
<otakon> so stream is dead while I was gone?
<CrystalPhoenix> yeah Stages
<Deacon> mmhmm
<DoctoDoctorWho> wb VenHur
<AJIsAwesome> I do like the visuals in the game, though. They're not bad.
<CrystalPhoenix> it's not open world no more
<CrystalPhoenix> it's stages
<J_E_Smith71> 10 minutes till ABC's Micheal Jackson special
<CrystalPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, the visuals are like the ones in TTYD
<CrystalPhoenix> Speaking of which
<J_E_Smith71> CrystalPhoenix: Well Super Paper Mario was like that too
<CrystalPhoenix> no story
<VenHur> Guys, just because you hates the newest Paper Mario game doesn't mean is bad in general!
<Deacon> CrystalPhoenix you sure this is a paoer mario game?
<cowvarkian> >.> are they going to raise him from the dead? J_E_Smith71
<VenHur> You'll get used to it like Luigi's Mansion!
<CrystalPhoenix> Deacon, to be honest I really am not anymore
<AJIsAwesome> Didn't people say that the 3DS'graphics are comparable to the Gamecube?
<haseo348> happy thanksgiving everypony!
<CrystalPhoenix> it says Paper Mario
<Dark92Enigma> which it's different with the new spongebob
<CrystalPhoenix> but it's not
<AJIsAwesome> Happy Thanksgiving, haseo348. :)
<spitfirecolt> not much never played it before right now i am playing malifaux doctordoctorwho
<Deacon> AJIsAwesome some people say
<VenHur> Used to be underrated, but thanks to Let's Plays, peoples opinions had changed.
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: game cube graphics are pretty good
<Dark92Enigma> By the way: Happy Thanksgiving everypony!
<CCCP> happy thanksgiving haseo348!
<haseo348> :D
<Derpy_Hooves> askstalkerloo is getting married
<haseo348> im eating right now :D
<CrystalPhoenix> VenHur, It's an interesting concept but.....
<Deacon> happy thanksgiving Dark92Enigma
<CrystalPhoenix> it's not Paper Mario
<CrystalPhoenix> where's the story
<haseo348> gonna get ready for black friday also
<CrystalPhoenix> where's the humour
<CrystalPhoenix> where's the badges
<CrystalPhoenix> it scares me
<Deacon> is there a story to it?
<CrystalPhoenix> Deacon, barely
<thelonepony> Derpy_Hooves: to how?
<CrystalPhoenix> like you meet up with some shiny sticker crown and she joins you to collect some royal stickers
<Derpy_Hooves> thelonepony irl
<thelonepony> who* :P
<thelonepony> Derpy_Hooves: cool
<CrystalPhoenix> the levels has no backstory at all
<CrystalPhoenix> unlike the previous games where each world had some interesting background
<DoctoDoctorWho> Nopony knows more lore than me~
<Deacon> maybe people don't like JRPG elements anymore....:(
<thelonepony> :(
<DoctoDoctorWho> Tee hee hee, hee hee hee hee
<Deacon> dat ice king
<CrystalPhoenix> but heh I've only beaten the first world so maybe the game will turn out interesting
<J_E_Smith71> Heh LOL moment on the Patriots vs Jets game. Guy missed the hand off and ran into his own lineman
<CrystalPhoenix> maybe
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: duh hell is wrong with you?
<CrystalPhoenix> with me and my 1000 coins
<CrystalPhoenix> right after the first world
<cowvarkian> Deacon: I do
<CrystalPhoenix> .......gosh
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: I dont know, mabey im on krak?
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: oh ok, carry on then
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ
<CrystalPhoenix> but yeah really sad to see that there's no partners
<CrystalPhoenix> especially when I thought we would have a chain chomp partner
<DoctoDoctorWho> lergmaflishpelgmaninerpfishdoloodlepkerloopydop
<AJIsAwesome> ?
<J_E_Smith71> Oh god guys watch the Patriots vs Jets game on right now, so many fail moments.
<CrystalPhoenix> CCCP I WAS SEARCHING FOR THAT VIDEO
<thelonepony> CrystalPhoenix: that would've been awesome
<CCCP> CrystalPhoenix :3
<DoctoDoctorWho> I think the internets affecting me...
<Zamer> for those who want to buy Sonic Generations, Amazon has it for $7
<AJIsAwesome> Which version?
<Zamer> Steam
<Zamer> 50% cheaper than the Steam Store
<Zamer> which is $14
<CrystalPhoenix> but
<J_E_Smith71> Okay guys on ABC Micheal jackson documentary is starting
<CrystalPhoenix> PC version is better
<thelonepony> J_E_Smith71: what channel?
<Zamer> also when i got back home i watched Yogi bear
<J_E_Smith71> thelonepony: I said ABC
<thelonepony> J_E_Smith71: i thou... nevermind
<Zamer> I kid you not Ranger Smith: "Do not molest the animals because they are under the protection of the government"
<cowvarkian> Zamer: >.>
<cowvarkian> I'm going to hope in that context it meant "fuck with" not "fuck"
<alexxm> Zamer pics or it didn't happen
<Zamer> let me see if i can find the episode online
<aniderp> hopefully i get the derpy <3
<Rex_Mundi> no stream?
<Deacon> *sigh* I forgot how tedious breeding for natures are...

<J_E_Smith71> Rex_Mundi: Nope you missed Wrek's Samurai Jack/CN marathon
<Rex_Mundi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jruPdPAQbxU
<Kandarihu> J_E_Smith71, I'm not sure there are a lot of football fans here
<headhunter> how often are there streams?
<Deacon> they varie on the weekdays

<sonicdude558> Hi Guys :)
<sonicdude558> Whats going on?
<Rex_Mundi> CCCP: Would it be awesome if SEGA revived the series and made an Ecco #3?:O. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5Dcd-0-JVw
<otakon> bah
<thelonepony> Hi sonicdude558 :)
<otakon> Skies of Arcadia is needed!
<CCCP> Rex_Mundi: YES! :D
<J_E_Smith71> Kandarihu: Neither am I, but I keep going in to the other room wher emy relatives are watching it becuase thyekeep laughing out loud because there were a couple of Fail moments going on
<Deacon> Rex_Mundi I would've liked to see ecco riding a vehilce in sega all stars racing
<Rex_Mundi> CCCP: Its really what the gaming industry neads, a hardcore gamers game like Ecco. There are too many Causual gamer games with wicked easy difficulty.
<sonicdude558> http://i.imgur.com/21pa2.png
<VenHur> Rex_Mundi: News flash, there WAS a third game. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecco_the_Dolphin:_Defender_of_the_Future
<CCCP> Rex_Mundi heh I agree
<Rex_Mundi> VenHur: That doesnt count
<CrystalPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, they will casualized Ecco
<VenHur> Rex_Mundi: It doesn't?
<sonicdude558> dat PonyChat
<Rex_Mundi> VenHur: Its not a sequile to Ecco 2, it has its own story, made by different people.
<Rex_Mundi> Deacon: Or at least see him in the background or something.
<VenHur> Rex_Mundi: True...the Ecco series along with Toejam and Earl and deffinetly Ristar and Alex Kidd was overshadowed by Sonic...
<Dark92Enigma> sonicdude558: i wish.......
<thelonepony> http://csimadmax.deviantart.com/art/apple-kong-262984556
<Dark92Enigma> sonicdude558: that would be the BEST INSTALL BUTTON ever
<sonicdude558> I had to take that screencap when I was installing my Persona
<Rex_Mundi> VenHur: Its like... SEGA wants to forget Ecco even existed for some reason. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk72RMv9d0s
<sonicdude558> Good luck Deacon
<aniderp> there was no ponies in the parade
<sonicdude558> ikr
<VenHur> Ecco only got two games, a game made for the younger audience, and a "reboot".
<sonicdude558> it needed some HUB and HASBRO
<alexxm> why would sega want to forget ecco
<otakon> bc it didn't sell
<otakon> that's why
<otakon> Skies of Arcadia FTW!
<aniderp> there was a problem with pikachu
<CrystalPhoenix> Has Alex Kidd ever been in a game recently?
<Zamer> damn internet why do you fail me twice today
<VenHur> Someone HAS to sign up a petion to make SEGA the greenlight for a new Space Harrier, Alex Kidd II.
<aniderp> his ears deflated :\
<VenHur> Billy Hatcher 2...Ecco III.
<Zamer> sadly I cannot find the episode online that doesn't belong to Amazon or Itunes
<VenHur> A new Space Channel 5...a new Crazy Taxi...etc.
<CrystalPhoenix> Zamer, episodes of?
<Zamer> the Yogi Bear episode i mentioned
<CrystalPhoenix> ooooh
<Zamer> someone wanted the infamous proof lol
<Rex_Mundi> VenHur: A new comix zone, new earthworm jim. Damn, SEGA has a ton of things it can make games for, why doesnt SEGA do anything with these liscences!
<VenHur> I love Crazy Taxi, the first time I heard of it was not from the actual game itself, but a ripoff called "Simpsons Road Rage".
<VenHur> Comix Zone was hard as fuck...
<CrystalPhoenix> Comix Zone was unique on its own
<VenHur> But Earthworm Jim 4?! Yes...YES!
<CrystalPhoenix> it doesn't need a sequel
<otakon> Comix Zone WAS hard
<VenHur> THAT WILL BE GROOVY!
<otakon> goddammit it was hard
<otakon> also, SHINING FORCE!
<CrystalPhoenix> Comix Zone was hard because lol 1 life
<otakon> I love Shinging Force
<otakon> CrystalPhoenix: and no continues and few powerups
<Zamer> well sale wise all Sega games are Cheaper Amazon(Steam) than from Steam itself
<VenHur> I like Earthworm Jim 1 and 2...I hates 3-D...but 4 can make it up for it...
<Rex_Mundi> OK SEGA, bring back Ecco, Comix zone, Earthworm ji, etc...
<VenHur> We had an re-release of the game in HD...but that doesn't count!
<Dark92Enigma> gtg everypony see ya all tomorrow
<VenHur> And House of The Dead, damn it!
<Rex_Mundi> I know you can get Ecco and Ecco 2 on Nintendos virtual consol.
<VenHur> Shining...Freaking...FORCE!
<VenHur> Heard it was an RPG...
<Zamer> thing is though if you get a WiiU you apparently have to rebuy the VC games even if you transfer everything from your wii
<Zamer> and Shining Force FTW
<VenHur> Oh yes, and a new Phasaty Star!
<VenHur> A NEW. FREAKING. PHANTASY STAR.
<Ryunosuke> ehh?
<Rex_Mundi> All these liscenses, what the hell is SEGA thinking? That a new sonic game, if good, can make up for all the bad?
<CCCP> Bye Dark-
<Zamer> yes
<VenHur> Who doesn't love Billy Hatcher? That one kid in the CHICKEN SUIT FROM THE GODS!
<CCCP> Why do so many people hate on Sonic Fans?
<Zamer> yes it can
<cowvarkian> I like sonic...
<cowvarkian> as long as it's classic sonic
<Zamer> because he's Sonic and if Sonic fails, then well
<Rex_Mundi> CCCP: It depends, there are many different kinds of sonic fans
<alexxm> chat derped
<Zamer> better call Mario
<VenHur> I mean, Billy is awesome...he rolls up eggs, hatchs up eggs, and defeat crows...
<otakon> bah
<otakon> SKIES OF ARCADIA!
<CrystalPhoenix> Oh boy Sonic fandom
<CCCP> Rex_Mundi i guess, i just never understood the hate for the fans
<Zamer> VenHur that reminds me of that episode of Billy and Mandy
<CrystalPhoenix> if you think the Derpy phenomenom was horrible
<Rex_Mundi> CCCP: There are the retro fans of the games. The fans of the new games. Sonic sat/am fans. Sonic X fans...
<CrystalPhoenix> You haven't seen the Sonic fandom
<Zamer> There is only one true Sonic Fandom
<CCCP> Rex_Mundi well people seem to hate on the modern fans
<Zamer> and Thats the Sonic Underground fans
<cowvarkian> I don't like the modern games, and can't understand how people do
<CrystalPhoenix> Zamer, you mean....that show with the instruments?
<Rex_Mundi> CCCP: I think most of the hate is aimed at the draws shitty OC characters on deviant art and then make fanfics based on them, fans.
<Zamer> yes the one and only
*CrystalPhoenix used to watch that show
<CCCP> Rex_Mundi buts thats like 85% of all fans for everything
<VenHur> CCCP: Well, the fans always whine and moans when Sonic gets a bad game, they'll all like "SONIC'S A WEREWOLF, NOOOOOO!" and then they're like "SONIC HAS A SWORD, NOOOOOO!", and then they're like "SONIC GOT KISSED BY A HUMAN GIRL, EVEN IF THE EVENTS OF SONIC 06 WAS NON-EXISTAINT, NOOOOO!"
<CrystalPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, you mean like Bronies?
<Zamer> don't forget they also rule 34 the shit out of the main characters as well
<CrystalPhoenix> HUEHUEHUE
<VenHur> Sorry for the spam...
<VenHur> But you get the idea.
<cowvarkian> Zamer: but so do we
<CCCP> VenHur lol
<J_E_Smith71> Hey the Micheal Jackson thing is showing never before seen deleted scenes from Bad
<CrystalPhoenix> hey Zamer Blaze is one hot chick
<cowvarkian> Zamer: and every other fandom ever
<Zamer> as far as i know since i don't go into the clopping section of our fandom include erotic rule 34 fics
<TrixieTheMagnificent> tooooo muchhhh freeee time http://i48.tinypic.com/2s1qjuo.png
<Zamer> was looking on deviantart for some Sonic images for a new wallpaper
<Zamer> yeaaa
<CrystalPhoenix> the 34 content of MLP is pretty large
<cowvarkian> Zamer: that doesn't mean it doesn't exist
<Zamer> never said it didnt
<CrystalPhoenix> at this rate it could reach the same ammount as Touhou
<VenHur> CCCP: But haul thier asses, I like EVERY SINGLE SONIC GAMES KNOWN TO MAN...Yes, I loved Sonic 06 as a guilty pressure.
<cowvarkian> Zamer: meh
<Zamer> and i know we rule 34 the shit out of the cast of MLP
<TF2Fan> Wheres the episode
<otakon> http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/loadingreadyrun/1877-The-Arms-Race
<Zamer> but i haven't heard of any clop fics with said rule 34
<TF2Fan> 6_9
<VenHur> ...Probally the only guy that loved Sonic 06 outside of the story...
<TF2Fan> :P
<Rex_Mundi> Zamer: yeah we do! <3
<CCCP> VenHur wow
<CrystalPhoenix> Zamer, what do you mean?
<TF2Fan> Im talking to choclate milk
<VenHur> Sure it had its flaws...but the music's kicks ass.
<CrystalPhoenix> there's alot of erotic fanfic
<Zamer> with rule 34 in it as well?
<VenHur> I think i'm seeing a patern here before Colours camed out...
<CrystalPhoenix> what do you mean exactly by rule 34
<Zamer> oh wait
<Rex_Mundi> Zamer: Erotic fanfiction is written porn, thus R34
<VenHur> The games were bad...but the music are good...
<Zamer> i was thinking of Rule 63
<CrystalPhoenix> Zamer, through bow and arrow
<Zamer> too much turkey got my internet rules confused
<DerpyMuffins> The whole gender thing?
<Zamer> Rule 63+clop fiction i meant
<Zamer> yea
<Rex_Mundi> I like ponies
<AJfan77> Hey Guys! Brohoof! /]
<DashWithRainbows> Rex_Mundi I like people who don't like poh-knees.
<DashWithRainbows> :3
<CrystalPhoenix> Zamer, one could find that easily
<VenHur> Ranma 1/2 = The birth of Rule 63.
<otakon> oh God
<otakon> yes
<DerpyMuffins> I thought it was Sumi's OC that started R63
<otakon> sadly
<Rex_Mundi> Molestia has a Rule 63 gun
<otakon> You know what always freaked me out though?
<Zamer> then gained renewed powers thanks to Haruhi Suzumiya
<Rex_Mundi> I love Sumicas OC pony
<RainbowPie> hey
<RainbowPie> So the next MLP episode is in 21 hours?
<otakon> What if Ranma got drunk and knocked up? Seriously I cannot be the only one who thought of that weird ass scenario
<VenHur> ...You know, I always want to make a Rule 64.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat 64 ping
<Zamer> what was rule 64
<otakon> ^
<VenHur> RULE 64 = Favorite N64 game of all time.
<CrystalPhoenix> otakon, oh the wonders of genderbending
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Glover
<VenHur> No expectations.

<Zamer> oh SuperBrony64 Sonic Generations is onsale at Amazon for $7
<AJfan77> So uhh, who started the rules of the internet conversation
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Really?
<CrystalPhoenix> SuperBrony64, Sonic Generation is pretty cool
<VenHur> Oh yeah, and another franchise for the SEGA pettion, Golden Axe!
<CrystalPhoenix> you should get it if you like Sawnic
<Rex_Mundi> Going back to SEGA... Toe jam and earl isnt a good game.... there, i said it.
<otakon> AJfan77: when it get's to Hitler it's complete
<SuperBrony64> 11,02As a PC download?
<Zamer> it started with Yogi Bear than went to Sega, than went to Sonic Fandom,
<Zamer> and yes
<VenHur> Rex_Mundi: Blasphemy!
<Zamer> Steam code though
<Zamer> http://www.amazon.com/Sega-40836Generations1-Sonic-Generations-Download/dp/B005XOJ6NK/ref=sr_1_1_title_2?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1353637772&sr=1-1&keywords=sonic+generations
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Oh okies, I already have it >< But that's awesome though :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Everypony should get it o-o
<otakon> NO
<Zamer> seriously for that price
<otakon> I do not get Sonic
<Rex_Mundi> VenHur: Golden Axe already tried reimerging, the game sucked.
<otakon> ^
<VenHur> ^^
<CCCP> Zamer I would reccomend using the site derpy.me to make links smaller
<MakerDusk> 8,05Gak!!!!!!!!!
<MakerDusk> http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/s480x480/68000_417624428303989_898410022_n.jpg
<cowvarkian> >.>
<DashWithRainbows> :l
<AJfan77> Ah, the Hitler jokes. Hitler can't catch a shiny pokemon, to Hitler yelling about another Bubsy game.
<DashWithRainbows> Damn it Dusk.
<Zamer> I was tempting to get Sonic Adventures 1&2 for like $5 but than i read about all the bugs in Sonic 1
<cowvarkian> hitler is best pokemon
*MakerDusk luffs on a DashWithRainbows <3
<VenHur> Rex_Mundi: Yeah, but what about a re-reboot that does NOT suck? AND IN 16 bits?
<Zamer> Rory is best pokemon
<CrystalPhoenix> Zamer, those bugs are the charm of the games
<VenHur> Hell, they brings 8 bit Megaman back.
<AJfan77> Captain Falcon is best pokemon
<CCCP> AJfan77 lol
<Rex_Mundi> Speaking of SEGA, Rome 2 Total War is being made.
<DashWithRainbows> <.<
<Zamer> Crystal not when they weren't in the original and the steam version is a massive downgrade to the 2004 pc port
<VenHur> Captain Falcon is best F-Zero racer
<DashWithRainbows> You should know that I can't let others see me do /me things, MakerDusk.
<CCCP> I like how the only pokemon thing ive ever watched is that banned episode
<Zamer> which one
<CrystalPhoenix> There's no other game that will let you go face to face against a STREET WIDE GIANT TRUCK http://youtu.be/hnUgeEGstDU
<VenHur> The Porygon episode?!
<AJfan77> Only knows one move: Falco PAWNCH. Accuracy: 100 Attack power: Insta faint
<DashWithRainbows> But still, <3
<CCCP> Zamer the one with the flashing lights
<VenHur> CCCP: The FREAKING Porygon episode that gaved kids seizures?!
<Zamer> you should watch the Beach episode
<Zamer> James has boobs
<Zamer> and it wasn't Porygon's fault either
<Zamer> Pikachu was the one who blew up the rockets
<VenHur> CCCP: Dude, you got some balls of steel...
<Rex_Mundi> I love how team rocket Cross-dreses all the time for no reason.
<VenHur> CCCP: Watch out fellas, he's a bad ass!
<Zamer> and Everytime The brats fall for it
<CCCP> VenHur lol
<CrystalPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, James had breast even
<Rex_Mundi> CrystalPhoenix: I know
<Zamer> inflatable breasts but breasts nonetheless
<Rex_Mundi> inflatable ones, that was even the joke
<VenHur> Zamer: Japan's weird as fuck, yo.
<AJfan77> Did you know there is a fail rate for a Master Ball
<VenHur> A fail rate...for the fucking Master Ball?
<TheArbiter264> hi everypony:)
<VenHur> ...Psshnah!
<CrystalPhoenix> AJfan77, I'm sorry for the sucker that missed with a master ball
<AJfan77> 1 in 67,000 chance
<Zamer> Reason for the Beach episode in the U.S. was because they feared it would promote gay lifestyles
<CCCP> Did you know Seth MacFarlane helped write Dexter's Laboratory?
<VenHur> 'Tis a joke.
<cowvarkian> Zamer: lolwut
<Rex_Mundi> http://maxiburger.tumblr.com/post/36134940091/what-japan-thinks-of-mlp121-with-timestamps
<VenHur> The Family Guy guy? Oh, yeah, I heard of that.
<Zamer> he actually didn't miss, the Swalot used Swallow
<Zamer> yea
<Zamer> Rex_Mundi you made me think that was a new episode with timestamps
<Rex_Mundi> There are actually some King of the Hill episodes dubed in japanese on Niconico.

<DeathStar> I HAS SOMETHING IMPORTANT! aparently the hub is having a 4 hour marathon december 24 of animaniacs :D
<Rex_Mundi> I love how my mom is cool with her 22 yr old son liking ponies!
<CrystalPhoenix> Tell me
<AJfan77> Its called an awesome mom.
<Rex_Mundi> *getting ponies for christmas*
<AskPeachy> 16 and BRONY /)
<CrystalPhoenix> is Christmas....really for presents?
<AJfan77> No. But partially it is.
<CrystalPhoenix> PARTIALLY?
<DeathStar> aaand no one pay attention to deathstar :(
<AskPeachy> I'm getting one of these for christmas http://d3vvl31cy8gagb.cloudfront.net/qt_188_launchpad/novation%20launchpad.jpg
<TheArbiter264> i'm only 8
<DeathStar> pays*
<Rex_Mundi> CrystalPhoenix: in my opinion, the extended family getting together is far more important to me than presents, im not a little kid anymore
<AskPeachy> zeh Arbiter
<AJfan77> It's about Jesus's Birthday.
<TheArbiter264> yr old
<AskPeachy> DeathStar: comforts
<CrystalPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, are you excited for ponies in christmas though?
<DeathStar> AskPeachy: why did no one pay attentions :'(
<AskPeachy> CrystalPhoenix: who isnt
<VenHur> Isn't the chatroom is ONLY FOR BRONIES 14 AND UP?
<AJfan77> How many of the people here are 16 or under?
<AskPeachy> DeathStar: *shrugs*
<CrystalPhoenix> and AJfan77 presents are EXTREMELY optional in christmas
<VenHur> I'm 16.
<Rex_Mundi> CrystalPhoenix: Yeah, I think/hope im getting Twilight and rarity brushables, then id have the mane6
<spitfirecolt> i am
<CrystalPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, go to wal-mart, they are about 10 dollars max
<AJfan77> Brohoof DeathStar /]
<Rex_Mundi> CrystalPhoenix: I know, thats were we are getting them I think, thats were i bought the others. Im in a training program, so i dont have a lot of time or oppertunity to go to walmart
<CrystalPhoenix> but like you said Rex_Mundi christmas should not be about presents or having some random stuff
<DeathStar> AJfan77: :D /)
<CrystalPhoenix> it's about a reunion
<CrystalPhoenix> having a good time with your folks
<CrystalPhoenix> there are families that doesn't even have presents
<Bronysith> there are starving dingos out there
<CrystalPhoenix> for christ,as
<AJfan77> Christmas is spending time fwith your family celebating Jesus's birthday.
<TheArbiter264> and with ponies CrystalPhoenix
<CrystalPhoenix> christmas**
<Bronysith> AJfan77: you dumbass, thats not what christmas is about
<Bronysith> SANTA HIMSELF SAID THIS
<CrystalPhoenix> lol Bronysith
<AJfan77> Bronysith : what :'(
<Rex_Mundi> In my opinion, christmas should be whatever you think it is. Persomnally, I dont think its Jesus birthday and i dont think its a religious holiday unless you want it to be. Its easter that is the religious Holiday and shouldnt be secularized and commercialized, but what can ya do?
<Bronysith> remember? dexters lab
<CrystalPhoenix> but seriously I don't care about Jesus or the origin of christmas
<Bronysith> Dexters lab, santa "the presents"
<spitfirecolt> santa is real
<CrystalPhoenix> all I love about it is the time you get to spend with your folks
<AJfan77> thats what i said
<AJfan77> :'(
<VenHur> It's whenever the theory if Santa's a myth or he really freaking does lives that long...huh.
<CrystalPhoenix> AJfan77, you included Jesus
<AJfan77> And thats what I celebrate in MY family.
<spitfirecolt> i am watching the alf marathon
<CrystalPhoenix> so yeah in short
<spitfirecolt> on the hub
<CrystalPhoenix> don't look forward to the presents, look forward to life
<AJfan77> Its called traditions b**ch

<cowvarkian> DeathStar: ikr

<CrystalPhoenix> now THAT is sickening
<CrystalPhoenix> or yet worse

<VenHur> Buffer show is best show, even a better show then MLP.
<Rose`wine> Bronysith my C2H5OH saturation is high

<CrystalPhoenix> only fanmade pony merch I have is this Luna hoodie
<CrystalPhoenix> very subtle by the way.....in a way
<Zamer> why did you vow not to buy anything from them CrystalPhoenix
<CrystalPhoenix> because
<CrystalPhoenix> there just flashy
<CrystalPhoenix> annoyingly flashy and attention grabbing
<Zamer> don't you know Rarity is the lead designer
<CrystalPhoenix> not THE Rarity
<Zamer> of course they would be flashy and attention grabbing
<Zamer> also Today has been one of the best days in gaming
<CrystalPhoenix> mmh?
<Zamer> got DOTA2 today for free
<Zamer> thanks to a unknown pony
<Zamer> who wouldn't register :(

<Zamer> Majora's Mask can never get overstreamed
<AJfan77> I'm not getting a stream.
<Star_Gazer> Majoras mask=Best zelda
<otakon> AJfan77: it's off for now
<otakon> yea it's Majora's Mask
<CrystalPhoenix> Zamer, and how about it's to a point where EACH TIME I hear about a stream I never heard about they stream Majora's Mask
<AJfan77> I agree with Star_Gazer
<CrystalPhoenix> also Link's Awakening is best Zelda
<otakon> I love Link's Awakening
<Valhalla_Fusion> Hello.
<Star_Gazer> CrystalPhoenix: die
<otakon> hiya Valhalla_Fusion no stream atm

<CrystalPhoenix> Star_Gazer, why?

<AJfan77> 1 Majora's Mask 2 Twilight Princess 3 The original
<otakon> one question

<CrystalPhoenix> otakon, you do not want to know

<cachi01> john madden
<Deadlypon3> NYC_Brony Hey Ice King, Why did yah Steal our Garbage?!
<Zacklego> its says that i am logged in
<VenHur> Hey, Kinect, here's a good idea, make a freaking DDR game! And make it NOT suck!
<Zacklego> somehow
<Yahooz> you have registered the nickname Zacklego. This means that all your flags and stuff are stored under this nick protected by your password. Once you log on with this nick, you can change nicks but still act under your aount
<Yahooz> *acount
<Kandarihu> I think there was some sort of rule that my participation in that focus group disqualified me from future focus groups.
<Zacklego> VenHur: Try Just dance. It will kill you.
<Deadlypon3> ...Okay, that's not possible

<Zacklego> Getting closer than 2 cousins in a bathtub
<wipergone2> ded
<wipergone2> pinkie pie
<Dovah> Daygon, this more than proves you suck at the game. You came on here challenged the first person who had the game and then started saying they suck just because they don't want to play the game at this time.
<Sumica> 00,10well that was disapointing
<Shammy> indeed so
<[Alpha]> it always is
<TheRandomkid321> Well that's depressing

<AlienWarhead> DOCTOR
<Deadlypon3> STUPENDUS
<TheRandomkid321> STUPENDOUS!
<Dovah> Daygon: Implying that by not playing for a few months greatly lowers my skill.
<Daygon> It can
<AlienWarhead> FUS RO DASH
<Dovah> Can, not difinitive.
<sonicdude558> that was some epic sentence mixing
<wipergone2> her armor broke
<Kandarihu> sonicdude558, IKR

<Dovah> Also, I'm not your brother. Daygon
<sonicdude558> hey Sumica, is it just me or do you have WindowFX or some thing similar?
<AlienWarhead> Sylandest: Wipeout

<vidmaster4694> its funny
<sonicdude558> niiice
<wipergone2> dat yay
<AlienWarhead> Sylandest: because the streamer wanted it
*sonicdude558 brohoofs Sumica
<Daygon> but any person that i know who hasnt played a game for a long time, loses skill during sometimes
<Sylandest> ahh. fair does
<Sumica> 00,10see
<Daygon> Pinkie
<AlienWarhead> CrystalPhoenix: Maybe this one http://www.welovefine.com/3336-the-sparkly-night.html
<Daygon> Man, i do not rememver these DLCs taking so long
<Dovah> Daygon: Yeah, i probably lost some, but I can get it back relitivly quickly.
<CrystalPhoenix> Heeeeh I might consider that one
<Daygon> It could, but it would take like 5 hours or more
<TheRandomkid321> Dial? And 12 and what is that?
<sonicdude558> Don't touch that dile
<Sumica> 00,10He looks like Scoot-scootaloo
<Deadlypon3> ...So a feathery BEAST?!
<VenHur> Really?
<VenHur> If so...
<Daygon> Does anyone know anything about the new episode on Saturday?
<VenHur> ...Huh...
<sonicdude558> no offence, but now I think that Scoot-scootaloo is kinda a troll/bitch/mean
<thelonepony> ...
<sonicdude558> after that one stream he streamed
<TheRandomkid321> I would be good at the big testicles... My assassin training would come in handy.
<[Alpha]> No and please be quiet and take it to p.m
<thelonepony> sonicdude558: he's plays around with us :D
<AlienWarhead> Daygon I do, but we can't spoil here
<thelonepony> he*
<[]DeadpoolDash> this is sad to watch
<Daygon> ok, ill wait
<thelonepony> and he's not mean or a "bitch"
<TheRandomkid321> sonicdude558 Shutup... last time I said something exactly like that but with wrek I was hated for a month.
<sonicdude558> the art contest stream back in october 31 was the worst stream ever. I thought the internet was dying
<Daygon> Time to download the longest DLC of gears
<[Alpha]> I think I remember that
<AdamTheDuck> It's a prerequisite for a mod to know how to troll o.o
<thelonepony> ^
<AlienWarhead> mmmmBananas
<thelonepony> fact
<thelonepony> :>
<Sumica> 00,10wait people calling scoot a troll?
<Dovah> Daygon: why so obsessed with gears all of a sudden? its quite old
<VenHur> Ooooh, BANANAS!
<VenHur> Those that gets the refference get a cookie.
<Sumica> 00,10and here I thought I was the worst troll here
<Daygon> I got the limited edition of Gears of War Xbox
<VenHur> Rainbow chipped.
<[Alpha]> oh crap I forgot to text someone back
<sonicdude558> nah
<Deadlypon3> Okay :P
<sonicdude558> but scoots gets on his mic and stops the video
<Daygon> And i never stop playing gears, its my game
<GabeMoist> I'm the worst troll here!
<Deadlypon3> ..
<Deadlypon3> Wait, was that a sexist remark?
<GabeMoist> Sumica is lying
<Sumica> 00,10ah
<Deadlypon3> ...Wait why

<StarFox64> haha, he said Gulag.
<Daygon> GabeMoist, I dont even know how to troll, so dont say that.
<Dovah> Daygon: aaannd now i dont want to play with you, it seems like you focus on one game and dont get any diversity.
<Deadlypon3> He actually went back
<Sumica> 00,10yeah dont think I have ever stoped out right
<Daygon> No not really, i just play gears more then any other game
<Deadlypon3> Gears?
