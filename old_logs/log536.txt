<K_A> AskDerpyDoo: I go there all the time.
<Riders> This isn't Final Fantasy movie. It was made by Square's film division and directed by the creator of the Final Fantasy franchise but it's clearly using the name to sell itself and considering the gamble they took on making it, I don't blame them.
<Crippler> he's got a very squeaky voice.

<DSNesmith> he directed
<K_A> Silverscreen: TBH, I do agree with you. Thematic similarities aside, it lacks a lot of the motifs and concepts that bind the series. A real FF movie would have had an epic fight instead of a single woman shooting shit.
<Saigneur> lol

<omegasparkle> skip the credits to get to ponies faster >:O!
<Hogia> 12but my dads' trying to amke me use both hands >.<
<K_A> 4/10. It just didn't hold my interest. The music was VERY mediocre given Square's track record. I already shared my thoughts on the main thematic issues, and the villain sucked.

<pony_300> 6/10, an okay movie even when judging from a non FF perspective

<MrBen> Actually, I revise my score. I give it a 7/10.
<magmablock> Can I spam a wall of ponies now?
<otakon> Meanwhile: the rest of teh game was damn enjoyable
<red_ony> 5/10 I like what they did with the grafics for the time it was made but storywise a big mess.....
<dashierulez> CAN'T WAIT FOR TREMORS! THAT MOVIE IS FUNNY!
<Freefall29> god, they explained nothing, had little fantasy, and based most of it off FF7 yet ignores all the others
<Bronysith> epicjacket/10

<CriticKitten> It's certainly not the worst thing I've ever seen, but yeah. 4/10.

<IMissOsamaBrony> LAME/0
<Luna1337> what is tremors?
<Hogia> 12oh god
<Nyst> Gaia is a pretty cool idea. A giant soul recycler that manages the balance of life on a planet.
<Riders> But the soundtrack gets an 8 for this song alone
<Dan_> tiem for ponies!
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: Oh no. It's bad, but not THAT bad.

<Chrysalis> for reference, there is now an entire skype call now gay for that jacket
<twilight_sprinkle> K_A: yeah thats cause Nobuo Uematsu didnt work on this one, his music was badass
<AskDerpyDoo> 8 spirits / 10
<MrBen> Only for that sudden cop out ending.
<Yellowquiet> ponies ponies ponies ponies
<drf|laptop> 03they take like 20 seconds to take a photo

<Kyu> 07good lenses, but the cameras themseves
<CCCP> oksy :D
<IMissOsamaBrony> SKIP CREDITS
<Fou_Lou> Its a bit weak in the end. i would probably watch it again. but for me its about average
<Kyu> 07not so much
<FuwaFuwaTime> 6/10. I hate this film. But love it at the same time.
<Beta_Carotene> there's really long japanese names on screen. That must mean this was a cinematic masterpiece. *slow clop* :'(
<CCCP> okay*
<drf|laptop> 03exactly.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> 2/10
<Freefall29> if it had ponies, I give it a 7
<Meanwhile> otakon: Yeah but EA sticks scalpels into the urethra of it's customers. Blizz is better than that.
<Narolas> Kandarihu: Exactly, it's not sending anything at all except "there's mife beyond death" and something related to the earth :p
<Fou_Lou> 5/10
<otakon> yeah, that's ALL of the voice actors
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...hi.
<Crippler> Time to grab some high-octane suds!

<DrBFlim> 5/8
<omegasparkle> show ALLLL TEH PONIES!!!
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello Spell-of-Gaming
<CoalDust> wasnt the best movie i have seen but it was still really good
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Dark92Enigma, calm down.
<Saigneur> HUG MACHINE !
<RX-78-SweetieBot> otakon: yes, it would be horrible, just not as horrible. The fact that the star child exists still leaves the endings to be terrible, not to mention that each one is LUL SPACE MAGIC.
<Hogia> 12it wasn't THAT slow
<otakon> Meanwhile: except for the whole D3 is always online
<AgentKalim> Meh
<richfiles> 8 Spirits and 2 glowy blue ta-tas /10
<SpeedyBolt> 9.999999/10
<Aegis3423> ponies wooo
*Saigneur hugs everypony
<Silverscreen> 1,11Idea was cool, but the characters were flat, the plot was boring and predictable, the "moral" was hard to decipher, and the overal execution was poor at best.
<AskDerpyDoo> Gaia applied on a universal scale is amazing idea
<Spirit_Vordox> 8 Science Fantasy /10
<Jim> G'night everypony
<Pinkielover123> PONIES PONIES PONIES!
<String_Shredder> 10/10.1
<K_A> twilight_sprinkle: I was expecting a audio adventure. I was pretty pissed after I first watched this.
<Kandarihu> Okay. If there is a message, it's that being gung-ho and trying to destroy something that seems to have overrun the world is never a good thing.
<SolairePony89> Hiiyo CCCP!
<Computer_Pony> Ponies time?
<Kurra> Everyone else's RAEGRATINGS: 0.5/10 would not care again
<SpeedyBolt> This ending sucked.
<Narolas> Kandarihu: It just ... doesn't really do anything, this movie :(
<Computer_Pony> PONIES TIME?
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Night Jim
<SpeedyBolt> Jussayin
<Tassadork> what Silverscreen said
<Phoenix_5707> *Hugs back* Yay.
<Dark_of_Max> 6/10 i cant give more........
*Saigneur hugs GilDash
<MrBen> Silverscreen: There was a moral?
<Freefall29> Kandarihu: and guns are usless
<Meanwhile> otakon: If you're willing to complain about that you're just a pansy.
<K_A> Silverscreen: I still don't get the point.
<CCCP> hi SolairePony89! C:
<StinkomanFan> 3/10
<CriticKitten> Silverscreen: 'sabout right.
*Saigneur hugs Gandalf_the_Brony
<pony_9729> HORSEFUCKERS.....justkidding.
<StinkomanFan> It hurt me
<AgentKalim> It wasn't The Room terrible, but I wouldn't watch it outside of this stream.
<Luna1337> http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn207/Xanadu93/IMG_1358.jpg
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon so you overlock the ending because the rest is enjoyable ? then overlock the fact with diablo because Meanwhile may enjoy the game
<Computer_Pony> Sad :'(
<SpeedyBolt> Horseapples
<AskDerpyDoo> its what most of my religious theory works with
<RX-78-SweetieBot> 8/10
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: dude, it's been said that any sufficently advanced tech looks like magic to those who can't comprehend it
*Saigneur hugs Irish_Pony
<K_A> Like years later, I don't get it.
<omegasparkle> show ALLLL TEH PONIES!!!
*GilDash hugs Saigneur.
<Golden> too many predictable cliches IMO
*Saigneur hugs pikorar
<octave89> it was a decent movie on its own but a terrible piece of fiction compared to final fantasy
<AskDerpyDoo> Universe Gaia
<QuickThinker> hello
<SpeedyBolt> Just a question
<RX-78-SweetieBot> SPACE MAGIC
<StinkomanFan> It touched me... innapropriatly
<Kandarihu> I give it a 7/10.
<Crippler> The moral is that ghosts are...bad?
<Narolas> Oh that's right ! PONY TIME
<Arcness> ANYONE WHO GIVES IT MORE THAN A 2/10 HAS NEVER SEEN A MOVIE BEFORE!
<IMissOsamaBrony> Luna1337 SWAG
<SpeedyBolt> What happens to everything now?
<AgentKalim> Nyeeeee
*Saigneur hugs Phoenix_5707
<Randomnerd> Arthur C Clarke.
<NxPaqu> This definitely wasn't a GOOD movie, it was just OK
<Computer_Pony> HAHAHA Times for ponies :D :D
<AgentKalim> alright
<operatorPony> but seriously... this song has aweird effect on me
*CCCP hugs Saigneur
<AgentKalim> I agree
<Tassadork> the moral is: trust the voices in your head
*pikorar hugs Saigneur.
<Luna1337> SWAAAAAAAAAAAAG
<FlareChaser> I give this movie a 1/10
*Saigneur hugs CCCP
<Kurra> At the Gaia! At the Gaia!
<SpeedyBolt> I've seen a movie :3
<tailsthehedgehog> It sounded like most of the voice actors weren't putting too much effort into it
<FlareChaser> it was bad IMO.
<AskDerpyDoo> its a 7/10
<AgentKalim> So basically, it's like the upcoming DmC game.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> SPACE MAGIC is bad writing.
<operatorPony> I am already kidna depressed... and it makes my chest feel heavy
<Computer_Pony> :'(
<ChimeraReiax> My routee reset itself.
<Beta_Carotene> its a VG movie, it's SUPPOSED to be horrible
<trollhunter> ok now make with the ponys already
<SpeedyBolt> Atleast about 8 here.
<ThunderCloud> Hugtime?
*CCCP nomz pikorar
<ChimeraReiax> Perfectly fine.
<unit741> anyone else notice that the newsletter says 2 "A" movies?
<pony_717> :[
<Phoenix_5707> *Hugs Saigneur*
<Fou_Lou> nothing speedybolt. humanity lives on.
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: that is not the point. it's draconian measures for the sake of the company and hoops the customer has to jump though just to play it
<Freefall29> out world is in peril, gaia, the spirit of the earth can no longer stand our planet being trashed\
<ChimeraReiax> :S
<K_A> So I'm biased. But please don't accuse me of not trying. That's the only reason I was quiet and otherwise sharing my honest thoughts throughout.
<TessHM> What was this I don't even.
<richfiles> Eww, Gaia!!! :D
*Saigneur hugs ThunderCloud
<CoalDust> hmm might just be because ive gone to way to many anime cons in my life time
<operatorPony> WATCH CREDITS!
<twilight_sprinkle> it wasnt That bad, ive seen way worse and more cliche stuff
<pony_9729> i just got here, what was this movie even called?

<drf|laptop> 03o_O
<Narolas> It was entertaining, but considering the money that was wasted in this and how it affected square, it really really dislike this movie :p
<AgentKalim> A terrible, terrible thing.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I give it a low rating for the reason it had nothing to do with what it was based off of
<Computer_Pony> The song <3
<Dark92Enigma> Sumica Sorry, just quoting the Nostalgia Critic at the end of his Battlefield Earth movie review......the same reaction goes with this film, honestly <-------- what did that have to do with the game, anyway?
<Corossion> when does the next movie start?
<Tassadork> the ending song is actually the best part of this movie. it's legit good.

<Freefall29> what's the next episode?
*ThunderCloud decides to hug GilDash, for some strange reason
<K_A> Computer_Pony: Spliced?
<CriticKitten> I also struggle to believe the technology of this world, considering it seemingly contradicts itself on multiple occasions. Otherwise, it's just weak execution all around. The villain's generic, the characters aren't filled out, the story doesn't really work. Pity, since the animation's fantastic.
<pony_717> how u talk in color?
<CoalDust> i actually havent played any of the games
<TimtheBrony> i like the credits more than the movie :D
<Bronysith> RX-78-SweetieBot: they shouldve included daleks in it somehow

<SpeedyBolt> JACK IN! MEGAMAN! EXECUTE!
<Bronysith> RX-78-SweetieBot: wait. the reapers are daleks. nvm
<Darkness_Pony> 8/10 Cause of its dtupidity
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon EA and bioware will do the same

<Arcness> NO! NO EASTER EGG! ENOUGH ALREADY! Okay maybe a little. XD

<operatorPony> OK Saxy, how do I request a movie?

<Silverscreen> 1,11If the movie promoted itself for its technology rather than slapping a Final Fantasy label on it, it would of done a hell of a lot better. Like Avatar did.
<magmablock> Irish_Pony: It's an anthology series. None of the games have anything to do with each other
<Arcness> Is there such thing as a movie with aliens or monsters in it?
<Beta_Carotene> I will give my life savings to hasbro if the last line of MLP is "and then they had sex"
<Pinkies4thWall> AND stop with the "PONIES" spam. It gets you absolutely nowhere
<Computer_Pony> season 3 announced... :D
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: which is? that guy who gave his life to save the lives of others in his own way?
<Sumica> 00,10guys there was more then one barrier city
<trollhunter> i dont give a shit who made this movie get to the ponys :[
<GilDash> Irish_Pony: It doesn't: It must have used the name purely for familiarity.
<spiritKirz> 8,6No video links during the stream please
<SaxyPretender> 0,14we actually just showed that a few weeks ago
<DocSane> It was FF because it has a threat to the world's lifestream and a guy named Cid.

<operatorPony> I've been so busy I haven't been able to come here
<Tassadork> the blending tech with spirits is also classic FF...
<Kandarihu> Yeah, I guess this does sound like L'Arc en Ciel
<OctaviaDashPie1797> *number
<pony_300> DocSane: bullseye
<spiritKirz> 8,6yeah, I think the Pinkie people just migrated to the main chat and stayed there
<CriticKitten> The whole cast was stupid and incompetent, but only one guy destroyed the city's barrier JUST to get permission to fire his giant phallic symbol

<Darkness_Pony> Dat song
<Pinkies4thWall> can't wait until people get kicked. I'mma lol at that
<DSNesmith> boo
<Meanwhile> otakon: Besides, I already had to install a new service pack to actually get the game to install. And I have several years of WoW experience, being constantly online isn't something that bothers me.
<coyboy> @spiritKirz : sorry I didn't won't happen again :)
<TheDeliciousGamer> SORRY KIDS ITS PONY TIME :[
<Dark92Enigma> Sumica True........they have no specific order......but i expected a better payoff, the idea was good, but the bulidup was lackluster at best (I know, i'm stating something that Silverscreen already said, but it's true)
<Irish_Pony> GilDash: Thats like calling a movie about WW1 "My Little Pony, Trenches are Friendship"
<Pinkielover123> Gimme ponies! :[
<Kevin> no

<LinuxBrony> I did really like that
<Tatergattler> meh whats with the ads?
<Computer_Pony> Where's the ponies!
<Spirit_Vordox> Silverscreen: Yeah but still saying that Spirits within TRIED something neweer
<K_A> Call me old-fashioned or stubborn, but I want a Final Fantasy movie that is true, old-school Final Fantasy proper. It could be a killer fantasy story if done well.
<Aegis3423> god dam credits holding my ponies
<LinuxBrony> I didn't think it'd be any good
<richfiles> Blue Pochahont... I mean Avatar? :$
<GilDash> Irish_Pony: It's not quite the same, but I get your point. It *is* misleading.
<Aegis3423> >:(
<Spell-of-Gaming> Can someone calm people down?
<Computer_Pony> :[:[:[:[:[:[
<Fou_Lou> statistically the nuber should be double the amount. considering the people in the mainroom and the available 6 side rooms

<Magic> who knows how to speed up the stream?
<Darkness_Pony> Whesker kicks ass
<GarrettBrony> who wants ramen?
<K_A> Honestly, why wasn't it? FFX came out around this time and it was much less space-opera'ish.
<octave89> gilda is more likeable than the protagonist
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Call me crazy? But I'd rather have stale and GOOD than to have something new....

<GarrettBrony> some lawn that I used to mow
<SpeedyBolt> I love it
<Silverscreen> 1,11K_A: I could see them doing one. I mean, the story itself would be loosely based on the other games, but the characters, the action, and the overal world wouldn't be THAT hard to replicate to film.
<TheDarkFreak> the space opera crowd was working on the movie, so everyone else could do FFX
<Pinkielover123> PONIESSSS!
<dashierulez> ty for all you do owners of Bronystate <3

<Thedude946z[Online]> Hnnnnnnnng
<Irish_Pony> GOD ITS TOO ADORBALE!!!!!!!!!!
<Whiskra> I really think we have this episode to thank for basically everything. Compare it to the recent Care Bears pilot, it's both funny, properly paced, introduces the main characters to the audience in both a funny and likable fashion, and immediately lets one pick a favorite. And to top it all, it ends in a cliffhanger. I really think that if this episode hadn't been like it is, the fandom would never have caught on

<Midnight_Fyre> Meanwhile: I read the fic Tiny Wings a few days ago. It was nice to read as Scootalo beat the snot out of Tiamond Tiara and Silverspoon
<Sumica> 00,10it seemed like the better plan then reverting to the one hour intermition where we pick winners from chat.
<MovieGunny> About Gunny: I actually found this first episode of MLP pretty clichè. But my curisoity compelled me to watch the second part and I fell in love with the show when Princess Luna apolgized to Celestia. I then watched all of the episodes up to S2E4 on YouTube and was a brony ever since.
<Beta_Carotene> Sweetie it sounds like you have an 8 minute lag on the stream
<otakon> Luna!
*kirzstryfe tackle-glomps Luna before she can escape

<Shizuka> 13Short story longer, we won't be able to do the newsletters quite the way we did before. Instead, we are working on a new system that should hopefully be better for the future.
<Beta_Carotene> actually the first episode I saw was Bridle Gossip. I was hooked immediatley XD
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*closed
<Shizuka> 13Let the techie speak...
<TheDarkFreak> ^pretty much my story, except I had to wait for season 2
<Midnight_Fyre> Not that it's a major part of the story, so not an important spoiler
<AgentKalim> Bridle Gossip was pretty good.
<Darkness_Pony> say does anypony know where Euro is useally located (Link Please)
<Beta_Carotene> Flutterguy wins
<Beta_Carotene> everything forever
<CoalDust> so i get some magic muffins, who wants one
<Midnight_Fyre> Meanwhile: I thought it was really good, though the last chapter felt a bit forced
<GarrettBrony> Hey CoalDust so hows Essex Junction been
<AgentKalim> If I had to show someone a first introductory episode, I'd show them It's About Time.
<otakon> StinkomanFan: no, he IS the Spirit of Chaos and Disharmony
*Bronysith hugs Luna softly
<Kurra> @_@....
<Shizuka> 13There is a good chance we won't be able to port the existing mailing list to the new system without major bugs developing. Fortunately, we can streamline the process of registering for the newsletter.
<Kurra> meh
<GabeMoist> Wooooooooona
<CoalDust> essex has been good, kinda borring but good

<SolairePony89> SABOTAGE, WUTWUT?
<mishia> Lol
<Darkness_Pony> for me its 9:15
<Derpy_Hooves> fuast just made a twitter
<Tombstone> No need to worry, Dark.
<Freefall29> G1 spike sounded like he was on drugs, G3 spike was... awful
<Chrysalis> if you ask for ponies
<Silverscreen> 1,11No vid links.
<Tombstone> Now.
<AgentKalim> No, no G3. Let's see the live action show instead.
<Meanwhile> Well, here's hoping he just goofed.
<Tombstone> BRB.
<GilDash> ThunderCloud: See ya. :)
<Midnight_Fyre> What do you recommend, StinkomanFan?
<Chrysalis> you get ponies
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> My parents added something new the last last time there were here - a Jack Sparrow wine bottle holder - :) drinking position
*IMissOsamaBrony cowers in corner, with a look of utter confusion on his face
<Chrysalis> plain and simple
<Shizuka> 13we have the new survey system up and running, but training is going sloooooooow
<omegasparkle> ah...
<otakon> Sumica: enope, RNG was outside of the stream window
<Sumica> 00,10I put it on screen like I always do
<Derpyrox> If you haven't seen meet the pyro yet, I think now's the time to go watch it.
<ThunderCloud> bye GilDash :)
<Freefall29> what live action show?
<RyunosukeKnT> AgentKalim:please stop talking :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> FiM Live action > G3

<Derpy_Hooves> lauren fuast just made a twitter
<Tombstone> Gonna go eat.
<StinkomanFan> What happens if somepony trips and stabs himself on our razor sharp wit?
<AgentKalim> Spell-of-Gaming: I know :P
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<otakon> Sumica: wasn't there last week though
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> too bad I can't have any wine - Jack's got the right idea though
<AgentKalim> Cool
<GarrettBrony> I do
<IMissOsamaBrony> then can i politley demand ponies?
<Computer_Pony> Noo my muffins
<Jspang1> Spell-of-Gaming: just barely
<rainbow> holy shit me 2
<AttackWithHugs> IMissOsamaBrony: TLDR, ask for ponies, you'll get them but they more than likely be the ones you want
<Darkness_Pony> All right~!
*mishia pushes spell-of-gaming off the roof
<Sumica> 00,10should have said somthing then.
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> well, not THEIR wine
<CoalDust> muffins for all!!!
<JESmith71> Sumica was showing the G3 Ponies, people were like NOOOO, Sumica said "I'll put on G4" and it was the G4 Live Action show. He then swapped it for G1
<Chrysalis> IMissOsamaBrony you can ask for more ponies
<rainbow> same exact way
<otakon> IMissOsamaBrony: you don't ask for ponies period
<SolairePony89> StinkomanFan: We need railings. And lots of 'em.
<Kandarihu> Derpyrox: I think it's a bit late for someone to go watch a Youtube video. The movie might start before it's over.
<AskDerpyDoo> Sumi, so last weeks pickers aren't participating
<Freefall29> you mean that one that only had twilight, rainbow dash, and applejack?
<Kammerjunk> StinkomanFan: ...what?
<Chrysalis> but you have no right to demand them
<Tassadork> OK, if by some miracle I wasn't the last person to see meet the pyro, you should SEE IT RIGHT NOW. and believe in magic
<Shizuka> 13dunno about you, but i'm not going to manually input them all.. and if we're not able to get it in a format the platform will understand, it'll be easier to wipe and have people resubscribe
<AgentKalim> Ace Attorney: Muffins for all
<TheDeliciousGamer> me shove them through ill catch them
<octave89> tasty
<otakon> Sumica: I did, no one listened. Thought it was rigged when Val got picked
<Meanwhile> 571 subscribes, under 200 lottery entries. Go figure.
<Derpyrox> Kandarihu: Perhaps...
<Shizuka> 13plus since we send 571 emails and only like 150 lottery entries come back each week
<Sumica> 00,10last weeks winners cant win again
<Darkness_Pony> What movie is next?
<Kammerjunk> What are you talking about, 'wit'?
<Shizuka> 13yeah
<AskDerpyDoo> can we pick them now?

<Kammerjunk> I'd pick films that I like, but I don't think most people would enjoy watching them.
<Spell-of-Gaming> That's what he said
<otakon> Meanwhile: yeah, but I was mostly referring to his troll streams
<IMissOsamaBrony> Freefall29 he said the a word
