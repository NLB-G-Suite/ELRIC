<ThunderDash> I'm a bit confused on that TBH
<PrincessMolestia> 13Images meant to cause great shock.
<Dat_Pon-3> im sowwy
<ThunderDash> ah
<PinkieThePie> PATTON!
<PrincessMolestia> 13Things like Cupcakes. That would be gore and shock.
<PrincessMolestia> 13Which are both against the rules. :P
<ThunderDash> I see :P
<PrincessMolestia> 13 1.21 giggawatts!
<Xaneco> cupcakes... dont be to hasty
<Amino> What the hell is a jiggawatt?
<Dat_Pon-3> but its not gory
<KingMolestia> 3Princess, PM
<PinkieThePie> what about the image on the cupcakes tvtropes page? It's not really shocking on its own
<lordpie> o
<Dat_Pon-3> the creepy pie pic isnt gorry
<PrincessMolestia> 13That wasnt gory, but it was Cupcakes. Borderline :P
<Darf14> Twilight is the new evil leader
<ThunderDash> the zalgo pie pic?

<PrincessMolestia> 13Just try and keep the Cupcakes to PMs
<herospirit> I don't think anyone can make something as frightening as the human mind; anyone sane enough to write a story or draw a picture, wouldn't dare put the worst things in their minds into words.
<Xaneco> :D

<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/Zu2GuK this is supposed to be scary but idk
<PinkieThePie> Personally, I found Cupcakes more funny than scary or shocking
<ThunderDash> cupcakes didn't creep me out that much, it was just... well, gross IMO
<Xaneco> loved that game
<lordpie> yay...
<Darf14> too loud
<PrincessMolestia> 13Eh, thats fine Decap
<Dat_Pon-3> cupcakes wasnt scary it was just like aww come on man its ponies why u do dis

<Xaneco> sudden burst of ponies
<TrollightSparkle> I get a bad feeling from those.. senses.
<PrincessMolestia> 13Or the "party van"
<Dat_Pon-3> im assuming twilight your a girl
<TrollightSparkle> *A sudden change of events&
<Shiggy> yes, twilight sparkle is a girl
<DecapPony> is molestia?
<Xaneco> the character is... i think he was questioning the account
<TrollightSparkle> He probably was
<Xaneco> gender list... nowe
<Xaneco> Guy
<DecapPony> guy
<Dat_Pon-3> duh like i dont know the character is a girl pony
<TrollightSparkle> Guy here.
<Xaneco> *ponits to twilight and molest*
<DecapPony> dari si a bot
<Xaneco> points*
<Dat_Pon-3> is there any girl bronys here im just wondering because it does seem hard to find dont it?
<TrollightSparkle> You sure?
<TwilightSparkle> yeah dat
<PrincessMolestia> 13I'm special. lol
<Dashite> Yes... YES... love this song...
<TrollightSparkle> Technically a girl brony would be a "pegasis"..
<DecapPony> when did dashite get here?
<TrollightSparkle> See what I did there?
<Dashite> Dashite is always here.
<Xaneco> i know 4 in person...
<Dat_Pon-3> TwilightSparkle are you a pegasis i guess go with what trollight said?
<Dashite> IRC Dashite is watching you chat.
<TwilightSparkle> Sure why not?
<Xaneco> my sister, my lesbian friend... another 2 girls from school
<Shiggy> so...
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> :0
<Xaneco> yay for ponies
<TrollightSparkle> Indeed
<Shiggy> has the term pegasister caught on yet?
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> :0 :0
<DecapPony> i would think so
<TrollightSparkle> Not really, just saw it around
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> :0 :0 :0
<Xaneco> i'm not sure... i used it and was stared at odd...
<PrincessMolestia> 13Pegasister... oi /facehoof
<Xaneco> among bronies
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> Wait...
<Dat_Pon-3> im just wondering cuz should we think of a name for female fans of the show i mean we got bronys
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> ?
<Xaneco> can't bronies be gender nutral
<Shiggy> it can
<PrincessMolestia> 13I just used the term Bronies for anyone who's a fan.
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> Are you alive? Dari? :o
<PrincessMolestia> 13*use
<Shiggy> but i like to think creatively
<Xaneco> likewise
<TrollightSparkle> Same here
<Dat_Pon-3> i dont know how many female fans do u see in mlp fandom stuff
<Dat_Pon-3> like dis
<Xaneco> more than you'd think
<PrincessMolestia> 13There are some.
<Dat_Pon-3> i got a point now dont i cuz it seems like we're all bronys
<Shiggy> id assume that most female fans wouldnt be vocal about their gender
<Xaneco> ._.
<Dat_Pon-3> u know whats weird
<TrollightSparkle> I know 1 person irl who's a partial brony, and that's it. And he's a guy too. http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ACfEBYic1BQ/ThiBcAFxsmI/AAAAAAAAA84/idyU3JZtvGA/s1600/forever-alone-face.jpg
<Shiggy> whenever i see some girl on the internet... well, lets just say anonymity doesnt create a friendly environment
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> *cough* ... why do pills smell horrible... especially Nexium...
<Dat_Pon-3> only in mk people specify their gender
<Dat_Pon-3> like always i see "who wants to fight a girl" and stuff like that
<TrollightSparkle> Well there are the 12 year olds, the ones that overdo the kitchen jokes, etc on the internet.
<Dat_Pon-3> thats stupid
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> Oh, SR... I am calling off, I am not mad anymore.
<PrincessMolestia> 13Make me a sammich!
<TrollightSparkle> Aw.. yes ma'am. ._.
<PrincessMolestia> 13lol
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> I'm like "lol" happy right now.
<PrincessMolestia> 13;)
<Dat_Pon-3> girls arent in my kitchen they're in my bed
<Xaneco> moral... episode 19...
<PrincessMolestia> 13What was that joke...
<PrincessMolestia> 13Involving a girl getting hit by a car...
<TwilightSparkle> what are we talking about?
<PrincessMolestia> 13What was a car doing in the kitchen?
<Dat_Pon-3> *hands everypony muffins*
<Xaneco> ._. not very funny one....?
<TrollightSparkle> And now, time for afk.

<Shiggy> its like, a man drives a woman over with his car, who's fault is it? A: the mans fault for driving in the kitchen
<Xaneco> never know
<Dat_Pon-3> my friend told me this really sexist joke he heard the other day
<Xaneco> why are there so many....
<Dat_Pon-3> what do you tell a woman with 2 black eyes?
<Xaneco> it's not even funny
<SilverMane> nothing, she's laready been told twice
<Xaneco> i know that one...
<Dat_Pon-3> yea
<PrincessMolestia> 13lol
<Xaneco> i know a different answer though
<Dat_Pon-3> i seen this pick on the internet that was really funny but sexist
<TwilightSparkle> umm
<Dat_Pon-3> it was an answer this kid wrote on his test
<Shiggy> ok, when a man tells a woman to go make him a sandwich, whats a good comeback for the girl?
<PrincessMolestia> 13I find them funny. Theyre in fun. I'm not so stingy I cant joke about stuff even if it pertains to me.
<Xaneco> i like antijokes
<Xaneco> ._.
<Dat_Pon-3> on the test it was a math question and in the question it said that this lady in the problem was wrong in her math why is she?
<PrincessMolestia> 13She better come back with a sandwich!
<Dat_Pon-3> he put because shes a woman
<Dat_Pon-3> on his test
<Shiggy> lol
<PrincessMolestia> 13Oh yeah lol
<Xaneco> what's worse than finding a worm in your apple...?
<PrincessMolestia> 13Remember that one
<Xaneco> the holocaust...
<PrincessMolestia> 13Wat?
<PrincessMolestia> 13...
<Shiggy> wtf?
<PrincessMolestia> 13I.. dont get it? lol
<TrollightSparkle> I'm back! And I've created a giant, delectable sammich for all to partake.
<Xaneco> why did the boy drop his ice cream...?
<PrincessMolestia> 13Yes... the holocaust WOULD be worse.. lol
<Dat_Pon-3> i know some blond jokes
<TwilightSparkle> Ok im back my sis just got off.
<Dat_Pon-3> Why can't a blond count to 70?
<TrollightSparkle> Why?
<Dat_Pon-3> cuz 69 is a mouthful
<SilverMane> Why did the monkey fall out of the tree?
<TrollightSparkle> Ha
<Xaneco> ._.
<PrincessMolestia> 13Ooooooh
<PrincessMolestia> 13Lmao
<TrollightSparkle> I'm a horrible person ._,
<PrincessMolestia> 13I am too.
<PrincessMolestia> 13I know that feel bro
<Dat_Pon-3> What's the difference between a blond guy and blond girl?
<Xaneco> gender
<SilverMane> fortunately i'm an amazing person, so it balances out.
<Jenemmy> Hi, Guys.
<Dat_Pon-3> the blond girl has a higher sperm count
<TrollightSparkle> Hello.
<Xaneco> ._.
<Dat_Pon-3> lol
<TrollightSparkle> OHOHOOH
<Shiggy> ok
<PrincessMolestia> 13XD
<Jenemmy> I came not because CottonCow's broadcast ended
<Shiggy> i have a poem
<Xaneco> Why was six afraid of seven?
<TrollightSparkle> Cause seven eight nine
<Xaneco> It wasn't. Numbers are not sentient and thus incapable of feeling fear.
<SilverMane> they are numbers and have no emotions
<Jenemmy> Because Seven obtained an axe?
<TrollightSparkle> I ruined it :)
<Dat_Pon-3> ever saw the movie The Sexy Pirate?
<Dat_Pon-3> ITS RATED ARGHHHHHH
<Jenemmy> Or was it because numerals are incapable of expressing emotion?
<Dat_Pon-3> lol thats so corny
<Shiggy> Roses are red, violets are blue
<Shiggy> I have a gun, get in the van
<Dat_Pon-3> ok
<TrollightSparkle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0PIdWdw15U
<Xaneco> what did the boy with no arms and no legs get for christmas...?
<SilverMane> An hawk and a squirrel are on a tree branch watching a farmer, and the squirrel turns to the hawk and says nothing as squirrels can not talk, and the hawk eats the squirrel because it is a bird of prey.
<Jenemmy> Roses are red, my deck is tan.
<Xaneco> cancer...
<Jenemmy> I have a gun, get in the van.
<Jenemmy> Better.
<TrollightSparkle> I have one.
<Jenemmy> :3
<SilverMane> Why did the monkey fall out of the tree?
<Shiggy> its not supposed to rhyme :P
<Xaneco> it was dead...?
<Jenemmy> But I like rhymes D:
<SilverMane> yes Xaneco
<Jenemmy> If I do not rhyme, I am out of beat with time.
<TrollightSparkle> Billy: This room smells like ass.
<TrollightSparkle> Joe: That's cause you're in it. ZING
<Jenemmy> I must stay in the beat, cuz my beat is neat.

<Xaneco> i know that one jen
<TrollightSparkle> I think xaneco knew..
<Dat_Pon-3> *dances*
<Jenemmy> Your mom is so fat she has trouble fitting into small spaces.
<Xaneco> Four blonds are driving to Disneyworld. They finally get to Florida and they see a sign that says "Disneyworld: left" so they take the left and have a wonderful time at what many people believe to be the most magical place on Earth.
<Dat_Pon-3> yo momma so slow it take her an hour and a half to watch 60 minutes
<Shiggy> lol
<TrollightSparkle> Your mom is so stupid, she can't perform simple mathematical operations.
<Xaneco> Your mother is so stupid that she was tested and proved to be mentally retarded.
<Xaneco> What do you call it when Justin Bieber has sex with a woman?
<Jenemmy> A guy walked into a bar. He then proceeded to order an alcoholic beverage and waited for an escprt home, like an obedient citizen.
<Dat_Pon-3> you hurt my feelings
<Dat_Pon-3> my reaction
<TrollightSparkle> Your mother is so ugly, it's not her fault she was born with a cleft lip and a partially deformed head.

<Dat_Pon-3> he was in a chair and it moved and he yelled "STOP THAT YOU FUCKIN GHOST!" then he was hit in the head with a toy car
<TrollightSparkle> Something jumped out at me.. it was a bunny. I named it George and took it home.
<Dat_Pon-3> none of us did it cuz we were in the back room
<DecapPony> now it lives in my basement
<Jenemmy> Really, quit it, I sit basically alone everyday and my eyes are already wandering towards my bedroom and closet doors.

<Dat_Pon-3> what im just teling a true story
<Xaneco> *agrees with shiggy*
<Dat_Pon-3> i was watching ducktales too when it happened
<Dat_Pon-3> lol
<Jenemmy> I <3 ducks
<TrollightSparkle> Bit of advice jen.. keep the lights on. It's what I do alot.
<DecapPony> something actually did jump out at me in a haunted house
<Jenemmy> They're so nice to watch
<Shiggy> probably some kind of animal
<DecapPony> turned out it was the hobo that lived there
<Shiggy> or your mind playing tricks on you
<Jenemmy> P.S. My lights are on
<Dat_Pon-3> thats just those manmade haunted house like House of Shock
<Shiggy> the human mind is still a big unknown
<TrollightSparkle> Mine too.. >.>
<Jenemmy> So, anywho.
<DecapPony> i like trains
<Dat_Pon-3> but i was 11 and at my grandmaws house and was eating a fruit cup
<TrollightSparkle> *hit by train*
<Jenemmy> Are you all fanboy/fangirl squealing about S2 like I am?
<Xaneco> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUAbRIXBTII&feature=related
<DecapPony> yay someone finally said that
<TrollightSparkle> I was when I noticed it.
<Dat_Pon-3> then for some reason i stared at it cuz i put my fruit on the endtable
<Shiggy> if you enter a place that is supposedly haunted you are pre-dispositioned to attribute any unexplained occurences to the paranormal
<Xaneco> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tiynTPuUUM
<Dat_Pon-3> it moved across the whole table on its on
<Jenemmy> Oh my gosh, didn't we leave this topic already?
<Jenemmy> You're ghost fruitcup doesn't concern me!
<Dat_Pon-3> and its weird i wasnt scared i was like whatever and went back to watching tv
<DecapPony> i placed a land mine in a haunted house, its non lethal though, but it will be funny!
<Shiggy> fruit cups are moist
<Shiggy> tables can be slippery
<Shiggy> do the math
<Dat_Pon-3> i think about and wonder why wasnt i scared?
<Xaneco> i posted two videos to end the conversation
<Jenemmy> Thanks
<Jenemmy> Now looping Giggle at the Ghosties like I do
<Jenemmy> When I'm scared
<Dat_Pon-3> no dude would this thing slide across a flat surface after being still for about 10 secs to the other side of it
<Jenemmy> :3
<Xaneco> ._.
<Shiggy> the fruit cup is cold
<TrollightSparkle> Well I'm..m here and there.. cause I'm playing Battlefield at
<TrollightSparkle> atm*
<Shiggy> it doesnt matter how "flat" the surface is
<Dashite> Stream over?
<Xaneco> the stream
<Xaneco> ...
<Jenemmy> Yeahh
<Shiggy> a cold fruit cup will me moist
<Xaneco> sad
<Xaneco> i was listening
<Shiggy> be*
<Dat_Pon-3> yea a moist fruit cup i grabbed it out the pantry it wasnt cold
<Dat_Pon-3> just an fyi
<TrollightSparkle> What stream?
<Xaneco> ...
<Dashite> Sathi was streaming music.
<Jenemmy> The purpose?
<Jenemmy> Oh
<TrollightSparkle> Oh, ok.
<TwilightSparkle> yep
<Jenemmy> I thought you meant movies.
<Dashite> Nah
<Shiggy> juice from the cup could have spilled over
<Xaneco> http://www.sacred-messages.com/wp-content/uploads/storage/Fine%20Art%20-%20Garden%20Within%20Forest%20Stream.jpg
<TrollightSparkle> You're back!
<Jenemmy> I was about to say
<TwilightSparkle> listened to every one
<Shiggy> idk, how old were you when this happened?
<Jenemmy> "The entire purpose of this site"?
<TrollightSparkle> Xaneco, I see what you did there.
<Jenemmy> I don't :P
<Xaneco> ._.
<TrollightSparkle> ..
<Dat_Pon-3> i was 11 and the way it moved is that it stayed upright and slide from exactly one side to the other
<Shiggy> you were 11
<Jenemmy> >implying 11 year olds aren't aware of the world
<Dat_Pon-3> i wasnt the only person in that house that weird shit happen too
<Shiggy> 11 year olds are messy, some juice could have spilled over the side of the cup
<Xaneco> mkay... we're done here... convorsation has run dry...
<Jenemmy> True
<Jenemmy> Eleven year olds are really dirty
<Xaneco> lovetolerateforget
<Jenemmy> NO MORE GHOSTS

<Dat_Pon-3> i need to replace my battery on my laptop and it can only stay on it the chargers on
<Xaneco> ._.
<Dat_Pon-3> i accidently unplugged it
<Jenemmy> Does your dark humor and jokes catch up to you at night?
<TrollightSparkle> Oh yeah, speaking of computers, I've officially lost it.
<DecapPony> I just focus on the music
<Jenemmy> Lost what?
<DecapPony> Himself
<TrollightSparkle> I baked my 8800GT, reapplied thermal paste, and it was working again.
<TrollightSparkle> Sweet, sweet Crysis.
<Xaneco> hardly... i think about everything...
<Xaneco> from video games... to life... to astronomy
<Dat_Pon-3> who put down that evrytime we log in i see rainbow dash is the best pony?
<Jenemmy> Never was a big fan of astronomy
<TrollightSparkle> I loved astronomy
<TrollightSparkle> Love*
<Jenemmy> But movie ad TV always come up at night
<Jenemmy> When I'm relaxed
<Jenemmy> For some reason
<Jenemmy> Oh, and games
<Jenemmy> Lots of 'em
<Xaneco> i just lay in bed and think all night usually...
<Xaneco> then end up writing...
<Xaneco> mainly about the moon
<Xaneco> or stars
<Dat_Pon-3> i feel like watching Mauskau
<TrollightSparkle> I just close my eyes and think of nothing.
<Jenemmy> I take it you're a fan of the sky?
<TrollightSparkle> THen I'm awake.
<Xaneco> the night sky
<TrollightSparkle> And I am a fan of the sky
<Xaneco> to be exact
<TrollightSparkle> Nothing like seeing the Milky Way at midnight.
<Dat_Pon-3> ?
<TrollightSparkle> IMO
<Jenemmy> Nothing quite a sight.
<Jenemmy> I don't see what everyone's infatuation with sunset's are.
<Xaneco> when i'm up at 3am... and everyone else is gone.. i still always have the moon...
<Jenemmy> I prefer watching the purple sky just as the sun went down.
<Xaneco> my friend unwavering...
<DecapPony> I like seeing the visuliser on
<DecapPony> my pc
<TrollightSparkle> I do too
<TrollightSparkle> Especially when it's rockin along with me and Coheed and Cambria or 5FDP
<Xaneco> an exact quote from a writing assignment i had for school not too long ago...
<Dat_Pon-3> coheeds decent
<Dat_Pon-3> i like em
<DecapPony> I lime chimaira and fear
<DecapPony> Factory
<Jenemmy> Fatigue...
<Jenemmy> Catching up to me...
<TrollightSparkle> I'm obsessed with coheed for a while
<Dat_Pon-3> is Moskau german?
<TrollightSparkle> I switch obsessions alot..
<Jenemmy> Thanks to you all, I think I might be able to sleep tonight
<Jenemmy> Thanks
<Xaneco> "I am from restless nights, Only the stars shine on. Without them I am alone and confused, When there is no one else, they stay by my side as friends unwavering."
<TrollightSparkle> You're welcome

<Dat_Pon-3> ok i lost the believability
<Xaneco> i dislike "1337" speak immensly...
<Unknown> hard 2 do this
<Dat_Pon-3> now your sounding like your forcing the proper speech
<Dat_Pon-3> if you're gonna make a character u gotta make him or her believable
<Fluttercry> I am partially OCD, so the proper is easier. Though I don't act too "snobish".
<Xaneco> i am pretty quiet
<Xaneco> and i like ._.
<Xaneco> and ...
<Dat_Pon-3> like how would she act if i go
<Xaneco> far too much for my own good
<Dat_Pon-3> fluttercry needs to get laid
<Dat_Pon-3> or shes a bitch
<Fluttercry> Oh graciousness! How dare you speak with such insolence!
<Xaneco> to the moooooooooan
<Unknown> beeeeeyitch!
<Dat_Pon-3> see i just can't take u serious now
<Unknown> not one these 2
<Fluttercry> Not on these two.
<Xaneco> this is pretty well serious though
<Dat_Pon-3> either fluttercry seems like she would just ignore it and not care
<Xaneco> she did change over time...
<Dat_Pon-3> or just call us immature in an intelligent way
<Dat_Pon-3> WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE DOING!
<EspyLacopa> Why so serious?
<Fluttercry> At first she acted quite like that.
<Unknown> but then i couldnt have these 2 fight now could i
<Fluttercry> Quite
<Dat_Pon-3> kbkfnohfa
<Xaneco> so i altered the characer
<Unknown> um
<Xaneco> ._.
<Fluttercry> What was that?
<Dat_Pon-3> if i take a hold of fluttercry id make her act like this girl i know joanna
<Dat_Pon-3> she always thinks shes smarter than everyone and trys to be like that
<Fluttercry> Explain said "Joanna"
<EspyLacopa> http://justjudyjudyjudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/pony-joker.jpg
<Fluttercry> Ah. I completely understand what you mean.
<Dat_Pon-3> i know shes smart but shes not very humble about it
<Unknown> lol jokerpony
<Xaneco> yeah, ive met that type
<Dat_Pon-3> she gets on my nerves i mean we were friends but i was the only one in the group to question her or correct her
<Dat_Pon-3> she didnt like that
<Dat_Pon-3> lol
<Fluttercry> I wouldn't expect her to.
<Xaneco> if you met me in real life, im quiet. sit in the corner... not talking...
<Dat_Pon-3> me im the outgoing type and really the one who jokes around alot
<Xaneco> but around the friends i've known for awhile, i'm a little louder
<Unknown> i get almost like a geek that has friends
<Dat_Pon-3> well dude i need to get some sleep
<Dat_Pon-3> its 5 am

<Dermathil> >yfw Thiessen let something slip about GRANNY SMITH being epically awesome in S2
<Pinkie_Pie> What? Lol
<Pinkie_Pie> I can only imagine what that could mean
<Dermathil> "sometimes its Pinkie.. but sometimes it's fluttershy.. but sometimes its rainbow dash, but sometimes its rarity... but sometimes is twilight.. but sometimes is applejack... spike too.. they all have great moments and characters.. its part of what makes the show great. granny smith is funny too.. but thats more of a season two thing. OOPS!"

<NewDCD> 9also you'll get Z2
*Dermathil is having a nerdgasm watching the customization options that will be included in the Space Marine Multiplayer. 1 BILLION variations of colors, model shapes and everything in between!!!
<Pinkie_Pie> Hi RobotPinkie
<Ziltoid> Coolio
<Dermathil> NewDCD, I heard something about TTGL: Gurren Hen a while back. What was it about?
<RobotPinkie> Hi Pinkie_Pie
<Ziltoid> I need the watch the new dr who episode
<AllisZero> NewDCD: I wet myself when Freedom showed up
<NewDCD> 9Dermathil: It will be streamed with Lagann Hen back-to-back on the day of the S2 Premiere
<AllisZero> No disagreement there
<Dermathil> >mfw people say the customizer for Space Marine looks better than the one in Halo: Reach (And WOOHOO!!!!! awesome NewDCD)
<AllisZero> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an2xkJrP3oI
<AllisZero> I love this.
<AllisZero> So much.
<Ziltoid> is there a video of the custonizer dermathil?
<Dermathil> yes Ziltoid
<Ziltoid> Linky link?
<Dermathil> http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/trailers/3792-Warhammer-40k-Space-Marine-Multiplayer-Customization
<Dermathil> you can be a beaky
<NewDCD> 9also
<NewDCD> 9do you guys remember our little talk about mass-production mechs comissioned by Equestria?
<Dermathil> I guess?
<AllisZero> I do not, but I am interested
<Pinkie_Pie> http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/173/1/7/atg_27__fluttershy_locked_away_by_smockhobbes-d3joirw.jpg
<AllisZero> What pisses me off, there isn't a single opening for ACE:R that has audio left on Youtube
<NewDCD> 9I tried drawing one
<NewDCD> 9namely Lyra's unit (albeit she'd be in the Equestrian equivalent of a GM)
<Dermathil> whatcha think of the customizer, Ziltoid?
<NewDCD> 9the mechs would be humanoid, but with a tweest: they have input modes for both pony and human pilots, and ponies can switch between both forms at will (since this is an universe in which travelling from world to world would change you to the dominant form/species of that world, albeit you can avoid this with the right equipment)
<Ziltoid> watching now dermathil
<NewDCD> 9in pony form, the magic in each of them is harnessed in the "Ether Engine", allowing for extra power/speed/ect, but much less maneuverability and handling
<NewDCD> 9due to the lack of digits, after all
<NewDCD> 9additionally unicorn-type units have an Amplifier Horn somewhere on the head part
<Pinkie_Pie> Pony cursors!
<Pinkie_Pie> http://coyoterainbow.deviantart.com/art/MLP-FiM-Cursors-Set-1-216778454
<Dermathil> NewDCD, godspeed writing that fanfic
<NewDCD> 9it can basically be used for GIGANTIC TELEPATHY
<NewDCD> 9"Watch in awe, as the GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie levitates a Beam Rifle towards her unit!"
<Jayne_Cobb> I like where this is going.
<Dermathil> hello Cobb
<Ziltoid> I love when games allow you to make right left shoulders differnt
<Dermathil> Hey Ziltoid, isn't it right that RobotPinkie had won the lottery but was afk?
<RobotPinkie> Figures
<Ziltoid> yeah it was
<Ziltoid> OH HI ROBOTPINKIE
<Ziltoid> We are Bff now k?
<Dermathil> so whatcha think of the customizer Ziltoid?
<RobotPinkie> What lottery, though?
<Dermathil> B-Movie
<Ziltoid> b movie
<RobotPinkie> oh fuck
<Ziltoid> lol
<RobotPinkie> the one I actually wanted to win, and the mods knew what I'd picked...
<Ziltoid> the customizer is pretty bamf
<RobotPinkie> So who won instead?
<Dermathil> Ziltoid
<Ziltoid> I did
<Ziltoid> :D
<Dermathil> he chose re-animator
<RobotPinkie> Ooooh, nice!
<RobotPinkie> Then I don't really mind losing
<Dermathil> was that your choice?
<Ziltoid> lol
<RobotPinkie> Naw, my choice was The Last Dragon
<Dermathil> ah
<Dermathil> I still gotta win to make CUBE be put on the stream eventually.
<RobotPinkie> I think it'd be an awesome movie for BMN
<NewDCD> 9brb
<Dermathil> (Been trying to get it since night #3)
<RobotPinkie> oh wow, that's kinda gory :P
<Dermathil> eh
<Dermathil> Cult movie is cult
<RobotPinkie> Don't get me wrong, I approve
<Ziltoid> cube with matt smith?
*Dermathil goes back to nerdgasming over the Space Marine Customizer
<RobotPinkie> I really hope not :P
<Dermathil> nah, Ziltoid. I don't think so
<Ziltoid> Who wanted to pick a movie with matt smith in it?
<Dermathil> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123755/
<RobotPinkie> Not sure, maybe Val?
<Ziltoid> man those choas space marines look so badass

<RobotPinkie> Spiced wolf meat is best meat.
<AllisZero> Cause I'm showing what you can do with that program
<ReticentSmolder> its a nice image
<AllisZero> I created the PDF and went to the local Fedex/Kinko's and asked them to print them in high-quality laser paper for me
<AllisZero> That poster cost me about $15
<Pinkie_Pie> Did it not feel awkward asking them to print that out for you?
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<ReticentSmolder> haha, yeah, most people don't have printers that large, cost is mostly the paper and ink
<AllisZero> (Funny story? The PDF was 800 megs long, it took their printer over an hour to print all 36 pages)
<AllisZero> Nope, I don't hide my powerlevel
<ReticentSmolder> oh, that's a raster image?
<RobotPinkie> I kinda want to do that with the comic con pony poster
<Shad> was your power level over.....nvm

<AllisZero> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqJS3EQ_v6w
<Pinkie_Pie> Post as many as you would like then
<AllisZero> /thread
<herospirit> What constitutes mature?

<Pinkie_Pie> You are so right
<herospirit> So many disturbing, disturbing videos to choose from.
<Pinkie_Pie> http://arch.413chan.net/fluttershy_ken-%28n1299208258098%29.png
<Pinkie_Pie> I quickly recovered this from 413chan
<herospirit> But again I ask, what constitutes mature?
<AllisZero> Rofl
<herospirit> Does gore constitute mature?
<ValtheJean> considering it's COMPLETELY inappropriate for minors, I would go with yes
<AllisZero> You guys wanted disturbing?
<AllisZero> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YKgqjK6dRY
<Pinkie_Pie> I honestly dont care what you post, I just dont want anyone to get banned
<ValtheJean> no

<ValtheJean> oh god! WE'VE CORRUPTED THE YOUTH
<Pinkie_Pie> I would want to keep it
<Pinkie_Pie> I would have to freeze it or something
<AllisZero> I had a small cake and felt like shit because the girl I liked was a bitchwhore from hell
<AllisZero> Ahh the memories!
<Pegacorn> Thor is actually a pretty cool game.It's made by WayFoward and SEGA.
<herospirit> I doubt I would have had the MANGRIT to watch MLP at 15
<AllisZero> But awesome Pega

<MeteorVenture> i still haven't seen kamen rider.. only recently saw gurren lagann but it was awesome (too fanservicey for me though)
<herospirit> I still can't decide on my video :[
<Pinkie_Pie> And then we agreed not to make a sparta remix of sea ponies
<Pegacorn> I wonder if the Bjornfort will be here today.
<herospirit> PINKIE.
<Pegacorn> I'M ON A BLIMP

<Shad> LOL put on CC for that vid
<Dermathil> so is stream still dead?
<Pegacorn> My new Steam nickname is "EEEEEVIL burnt face Rat"
<ValtheJean> do you guys hate it when you lose music because of a hardware issue, and then you're trying to remember the songs you listened to but some of them are just barely out of reach in your mind?
<ValtheJean> I certainly do
<ValtheJean> it sucks

<MeteorVenture> hey guys i gots a sitiation.. see my name MeteorVenture? well i normally go by chunkatuff but i haven't been for nearly all pony related things.. should i change back to my normal name? (cause i do want to keep a consistent name)
<ValtheJean> up to you bro
<Ghosties> 4Your decision
<Pegacorn> No problem Ghosties.Just stay away from "Don't be afraid of the Dark".
<Ghosties> 4Aye, got it
<MeteorVenture> it's just that i've had this name now for 6-7 or so months now.. it's a bit far in
<Pegacorn> It's full of horror clichés and it thinks it's scary.
<Pegacorn> It's not.
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPG8Co_9xo
<Shad> its far in?
<Shad> THATS WHAT SHE....nvm
<Dermathil> IS STREAM UP
<GGgala> Pegacorn: the 2010 remake or the 1973 oriinal?
<GGgala> *original
<Pegacorn> The remake
<Pegacorn> I really don't know anything about the original.
<GGgala> Dermathil: stream ain't up for me
<MeteorVenture> ok well thanks for the replies i guess i will probably just change it back.. besides this name is from that really old pony name generator that i'm not sure exists anymore
<Pegacorn> Guillermo Del Toro can go to hell for annoying me to death with his stupid "Don't be afraid of the dark" trailer.

<Pinkie_Pie> Some people are terrified of it
*Pegacorn punches Pinkie_Pie in the gut
<herospirit> I have decided that I am too lazy to make a Sea Ponies Sparta remix
<Pegacorn> Sorry,AT4W joke.
<Shad> can you explain why my left foot is cold but my right one is warm
<Shad> I have no idea how this is
<Dermathil> NewDCD, seeing as how the show will probably air in the morning (saturday morning cartoon is what's being thought), will the streaming of the movies during that Saturday be after the episode?
<MeteorVenture> i seriously loved that game.. played through it 3 times in succession just to do and see everything
<AllisZero> Eh, Lunatic is a cool guy. He kills bad guys and doesn't afraid of anything

<Ghosties> 4Most likely
<herospirit> So I'm working on an RPG game. My goal is for it to be AS RANDOM AS FUCKING POSSIBLE while still having a compelling story and likable characters.
<Radagast> I can't find that one Halle Berry movie.
<herospirit> If I get it to a testable point, would anyone like a demo? :0
<Pinkie_Pie> You guys need to see this
<Shad> that RPG better have ponies
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Qja_JqkVx0
<ValtheJean> and it better not be DURRRRGARRRR
<Silvermane> herospirit, i'm always one for an RPG
<Radagast> The one where Halle has 3 split personalities; one of which is a racist old white woman
<herospirit> Shad: Not as the main part of the game, but I'll sneak some Ponies in ; ]
<Silvermane> ValtheJean, seriously. come on, Mardek really is a great game. just because it's not free-form rpg doesn't mean it's bad.
<EdwardNewgate> herospirit throw in some some shipping and I'd play it
<Shad> I'd play it if it has a good plot
<Silvermane> lol Edwardnewgate, that's Bjornfot's game
<herospirit> EdwardNewgate: Normal shipping or Pony shipping?
<herospirit> :P
<EdwardNewgate> herospirit Doesn't matter
<Silvermane> would it really be shipping if it's canon?
<ValtheJean> no, it's complete and utter shit silvermane
<herospirit> SilverMane has a point
<Silvermane> glad to know you have such an unfair bias on a game you've never played
<DSNesmith> inb4 flames
<Pegacorn> lol
<Silvermane> anyways... what style of RPG is it Herospirit?
*Pegacorn is on the floor
<herospirit> Turnbased. :0
<Pegacorn> inb4 Walk the dinosaur
<ValtheJean> glad to know you're so adamantly defending an rpg that has no merit
<Shad> make an ursa minor and major as bosses
<Shad> trololololol
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.sadanduseless.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/gif/331.gif
<Silvermane> it has significant merit. It is probably the most highly lauded flash RPG i know of and has garnered Fighunter/psuedolonewolf the respect of legions of flash players
<Silvermane> so, TBS, herospirit? like fire emblem?
<herospirit> Nah, like Old Final Fantasy style.
<Silvermane> ah sweet. how are skills handled?
<ValtheJean> What merit silvermane? A highly lauded flash rpg is still a nicely decorated turd
<EdwardNewgate> Silver, Bjornfot's is solely shipping, I'm suggesting an rpg with shipping involed
<Pegacorn> Damnit Val,stop being bias towards things you don't like!
<herospirit> Mostly gotten from levels, a few from side quests and during the Storyline.
<EdwardNewgate> or whatever you call it
<ValtheJean> lol pegacorn
<GGgala> >Val implying the platform is an indicator of quality
<ValtheJean> in the terms of flash? it usually is
<Silvermane> lol I know EdwardNewgate, i was just commenting... hoping bjornfot comes on soon and gives us an update. haven't seen him in a while
<herospirit> I have started an argument. RPG's are now on my list of things not to mention :P
<ValtheJean> lol
<EdwardNewgate> He was on on Friday, wasn't he?
<GGgala> better add Caramel to that list then, hero
<Silvermane> Flash has made some amazing games and stories. If a game is good for the PS1, then flash can make a good game as well as it has the same strength
<herospirit> I have enraged Val the Impaler
<ValtheJean> now now, you're welcome to discuss RPGs, I'll just keep my highly refined tastes out since apparently some people wont listen to reason :P
<Silvermane> lol
<RobotPinkie> >reason
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Silvermane> reason is not jumping to hatred over something you haven't tried
<GGgala> RobotPinkie: eeyup
<Silvermane> ^
<RobotPinkie> To each his own, really.
<ValtheJean> I have seen PLENTY of the game silvermane
<ValtheJean> plenty
<herospirit> I'm using RPGMakerVX for mine, so it's kind of hard to make it stand out.
<RobotPinkie> I mean personally I love ponies, but I'm guessing I'm in the minority.
<Silvermane> ?
<MeteorVenture> think your tastes are refined val? i haven't played a game i've liked in 16 years!
<Silvermane> I love ponies...
<Silvermane> RobotPinkie, i'm lost on your comment
<ValtheJean> that's not refined, that's just hermit-ism :P
<herospirit> I'm trying to use completely custom art and music to make my game a little different.
<RobotPinkie> :O you too?
<MeteorVenture> lols
<RobotPinkie> omg
<herospirit> OH MY GOSH PINKIE, I like Ponies TOO!
<Silvermane> >mfw i've been trolled. well played, good sir...
<MeteorVenture> i'm jk though.. i really like some stuff.. i'm gonna try to get into dwarf fortress
<RobotPinkie> I'm kinda kidding, though I mean the point is mostly that not everyone likes the same thing and it's not a big deal :P
<Shad> I haven't found a PC game that I haven't quit yet
<Shad> they're usually fun for a while but they get old
<ValtheJean> of course, just they're all wrong :P
<RobotPinkie> Not intended as a troll, Silvermane, just a joke
<Shad> ponies will NEVER get old
<MeteorVenture> shad haven't you played any pony games?
<Shad> Opie denied
<Denied_Existence> Back again
<RobotPinkie> Oh yeah Shad, then what about Granny Smith?
<Shad> no i can't find any
<Shad> D:
<RobotPinkie> lololol
<Shad> what about granny smith
<Shad> <_<
<Silvermane> true, but there is a difference between stating a personal liking or disliking of something, and saying something is good or bad. I can enjoy things that i know are bad, and hate things i know are good.
<herospirit> I think I'll try this Bullet Hell Pony game now :0
<RobotPinkie> >ponies will NEVER get old
<RobotPinkie> >granny smith
<Pegacorn> brb,gotta eat
<Shad> I SEE WHAT U DID THER
<MeteorVenture> equestria gaming = equestria daily.. for games
<RobotPinkie> lololol
<Shad> k
<Silvermane> hmm, i wonder if any pony games have finished since i last looked
<AllisZero> >mfw I've been running WoW simulations for the past half hour
<RobotPinkie> I agree, Silvermane
<ValtheJean> break the curse Allis! free yourself from WoW's even taint!
<herospirit> I still can't wait for Fighting is Magic.
<MeteorVenture> ya i wanna own some noobs
<Silvermane> oh WoW... i remember WoW... 6 months of my life, and a lv 73 undead warlock later
<AllisZero> Can't, not until the next expansion :(
<Silvermane> their doing another expansion?
<Silvermane> they're*
<ValtheJean> DO IT NAOUGH ALLIS
<ValtheJean> yeah
<Shad> there's a game called dash off
<herospirit> Did you hear that Mane6 is gonna have a live stream of Fighting is Magic on the second? : D
<Shad> if applejack had a game what would it be called
<ValtheJean> I heard it was going to be called "Tales of Pandaria" *barf*
<Shad> TROLOLOL
<ValtheJean> I'll be honest, I miss WoW...I miss it a lot. But the best decision of my life was quitting it
<desertman2> I want to try WoW, but I'm a bit worried that it will take a long time to install
<ValtheJean> ohai rainbrodash
*RainBroDash 10*flexes*
<ValtheJean> don't do it desertman
<RainBroDash> 10ohai ValtheJean
<MeteorVenture> never played wow never wanted to.. forever
<ValtheJean> just dont! it's EVIILLLLLLL
<RobotPinkie> The kind of pony game I want.... is a Zelda clone...
*Silvermane glomps RainBroDash "I missed you!"
<RobotPinkie> That'd be sweet.
<RainBroDash> 10desertman2 from experience. RUN. GET AWAY. AS FAST AS YOU CAN
<MeteorVenture> can't wait for equestria online lol

<Spazturtle> RainBroDash Where was Gondor when you quit WoW?
<herospirit> Where was Gondor when herospirit was FOREVER ALONE?
<MeteorVenture> am i the only one who hates that show?
<herospirit> MeteorVenture: Nope
<RainBroDash> 10spazturtle lolwat
<herospirit> It had a couple good moments, but...
<Pegacorn> I'm back
<MeteorVenture> lol hero you have my same unpopular opinion on some things it seems
<Spazturtle> RainBroDash Were you here yesterday during the twin towers?
<herospirit> It would seem XP
<ValtheJean> I think the gondor meme has to be preceded with the "It begins, the great shitstorm of our time"
<RainBroDash> 10RobotPinkie yes all is great, busy though
<RainBroDash> 10spazturtle eenope. I had to go to bed early, been travelling all day today, bloody knackered
<ValtheJean> :- /
<ValtheJean> sorry to hear that RBD
<ValtheJean> how long was the trip?
<herospirit> @pony the Pony Gondor was with when all this happened
<herospirit> AWWW. Who killed steven?
<ValtheJean> lol he's been dead since...like thursday
<Shad> I shot the sheriff, but i didn't shoot steven
<Silvermane> i liked WoW when i played it. i dislike how streamlined it has gotten, and i wouldn't play again, but i liked it back during the frist expansion
<RainBroDash> 10ValtheJean well not too bad, about 6 and a half hours in total
<ValtheJean> ah
<ValtheJean> still, cramps up your legs and whatnot :P
<ValtheJean> then again, you didn't have to drive through Vegas with no AC on a 13 hour drive :P
<RainBroDash> 10fair:P
<Shad> i've taken an 8 hour car ride when I went on vacation in canada
<RainBroDash> 10but I had to take trains ;_;
<ValtheJean> me gusta trains!

<Shad> WITH A THOUSAND LIES AND A GOOD DISGUISE, HIT EM RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES, HIT EM RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES
<Shad> WHEN YOU WALK AWAY NOTHING MORE TO SAY, SEE THE LIGHTNING IN YOUR EYES, SEE EM RUNNING, FOR THEIR LIVES
<Shad> i'm done

<ValtheJean> what's that song called again?

<Shad> clean?
<Shad> ewwww
<MeteorVenture> yes :|
<Silvermane> dance brony dance...
<Shad> I listen to stuff with a TON more cussing than that
<MeteorVenture> i hate hearing it really.. but also lauren said dance puppets dance and it fits too well that it should be sung that way anyway
<Flutteryay> helloooo
<Shad> Opie flutteryay
<MeteorVenture> so*
<MeteorVenture> on a pony related video anyway
<Dermathil> so what's happening right now?
<Shad> not much
<ValtheJean> I'm smashing my face against my desk trying to remember some of the bands I listen to
<Pinkie_Pie> Trololol
<ValtheJean> it's not very effective
<Pinkie_Pie> Im Pinkie_Pie here, and Bubble_Berry on everypony radio
<RainBroDash> 10SilverMane I regret that, but shit internet was a curse
<Shad> is your desk wood?
<Pinkie_Pie> PONYCEPTION
<Silvermane> awww, would you like transcripts of what you missed Dashie?

*Shad grabs rainbro and runs away
<MeteorVenture> val do you have sound horizon?
<herospirit> *loses Pony TouHou*
<Dermathil> Val, want me to continue the LP of Darksiders on my livestream?
<herospirit> FFFF
<ValtheJean> sound horizon? never heard of it
<herospirit> I let mah gaurd down. Ponies do that to you
<ValtheJean> and it's okay dermathil, I've got a few distractions atm :P
<RainBroDash> 10well silvermane maybe at some point, trying to sort out some bronystate stuff and some uni stuff and some 'oh shit i have no money, just realised' stuff xD
<RobotPinkie> HNNNNNG so much to do
<MeteorVenture> sound horizon is awesome.. but japanese btw if it matters
<herospirit> ...Also I should have known better than to even think of trying hard mode
<ValtheJean> OMG
<ValtheJean> I JUST REMEMBERED ONE
<ValtheJean> AHAAHAHAAHAHAAHAHA
*ValtheJean starts listening to them

<Pinkie_Pie> It sounds like music.. But.. Its.. Its...

<RobotPinkie> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/170/5/b/hugs_for_luna_by_furboz-d3jdc4m.jpg this is why I have to hug Luna every time, obviously.
<ValtheJean> lol
<Shad> *yay*

<Luna> 7Yay love me more
*Silvermane hugs RainBroDash YAY you did it for me!
<Spazturtle> DSNesmith c ya
<ValtheJean> Rainbrodash, in honor of your gallant efforts against the villainous sea ponies, I present to you my most sacred gift
<Silvermane> If you gots an issue, here's a tissue! Also, i listen well. and apparently i talking like orc sisters now
<RobotPinkie> Depending on how Season 2 goes, Princess Luna might be best pony...
<Silvermane> ^
<ValtheJean> I present to you, my most cherished trident: The Trident of Sea-Pony Smiting!
<ValtheJean> May you use it well against the vile sea-ponies
<Silvermane> did you see the comic about how the fans will react to Luna's episode, RobotPinkie?
<RainBroDash> 10is it +3 against hippocampus?
*ValtheJean hands Rainbrodash the emerald encrusted trident
<Shad> I prefer killing them with fire
<ValtheJean> eenop, +7
<RobotPinkie> Nope Silvermane, link?
<RobotPinkie> I'm 99% sure that I'll love the Luna ep, though :P
<Shad> THERE'S A LUNA EP?
<Shad> WHENNNNNNNNNNNN
<RainBroDash> 10ValtheJean I like where this is going
<ValtheJean> just PUTTING luna in the show will make it awesome
<ValtheJean> and Shad, they confirmed luna will appear in S2
<Shad> FUCK YEAH!
*Shad punches an orphan and kicks a cat
<Shad> I'M READY
<ValtheJean> one of the animators basically said: "I can't spoil anything, but I've seen the luna episode and thought it was good"
<Luna> 7WAT
<Pinkie_Pie> Thanks for knocking some sense into me RainbroDash
<Denied_Existence> 3They also confirmed there would be brony related stuff in S2
<Luna> 7stop kicking the cats!
<Shad> k :(
<ValtheJean> and they confirmed that S2 will be SO AWESOME /)^3^(\
*desertman2 keeps refreshing the stream
<Pinkie_Pie> Hey RainBroDash
<Pinkie_Pie> When you kicked me, my computer froze
<ValtheJean> lol desertman2, they'll let us know when it's working again :P
<Pinkie_Pie> And when it finally unfroze I had to clear my internet cache to get back in
<Shad> so can I still punch orphans?
<Pinkie_Pie> So now I have to log back in everywhere again
<Denied_Existence> 3Ouch
<Pinkie_Pie> FUUUUU
<Denied_Existence> 3Y U SO EVIL RBD!?
<RainBroDash> 10Pinkie_Pie I am truthfully sorry. Here is a miniature bouncing Ramona to ever keep you company: http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101124124530/scottpilgrim/images/3/34/Ramona_victory-1-.gif
<RobotPinkie> NOT THE ORPHANS!
<RobotPinkie> I used to be an orphan
*Dermathil has read the "Ask Me Anything" by Jayson Thiessen. He has said there would be fun moments with Granny Smith
<RainBroDash> 10I hope you will gratefully accept my token of apology xx<3
*Shad starts to punch robot but realizes he is no longer an orphan and stops halfway
<ValtheJean> quick! let's stop by an orphanage and hang a $50 bill by a string!
<Silvermane> EVERYPONY WHO LOVES LUNA http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/233/8/3/season_2_blues_by_blade_zulah-d47f5yt.png
<ValtheJean> dat reference anyone?
<RobotPinkie> lol, it's from Black Dynamite
<Shad> who doesn't love luna
<ValtheJean> eenope robotpinkie
<ValtheJean> simpsons did it first :P
<Pinkie_Pie> Should I know who Ramona is?
<Pinkie_Pie> I demand a bouncing minecraft creeper instead
<Pinkie_Pie> Good luck finding that
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<RainBroDash> 10Silvermane I lol'd too hard.I thank you
<ValtheJean> lol Silvermane, dat comic
<ValtheJean> what's sad
<Silvermane> is it is true...
<ValtheJean> you know that's exactly what's going to happen
<RobotPinkie> They did "NOT THE ORPHANS!" first?
<ValtheJean> SOMEONE is going to get incredibly pissed off that their particular variation of luna fanon is not canon
<RobotPinkie> wow, I missed that
<Silvermane> fortunately i know almost all forms of Luna, so i can't be disappoint. unless they totally fuck with her and make her a blabbering idiot who does ballet or something
<ValtheJean> lol
<RobotPinkie> I don't give a shit about anyone's Luna fanon, I'll be happy as long as she's consistent with what they presented in Season 1... which wasn't much
<Shad> if she did ballet i'd still love her
<Shad> luna is best pony
<Silvermane> ...
<Silvermane> Shad, you know what, so would i.
<ValtheJean> I don't even care if she's any way related to any form of fanon, if she's a solid character I'll be fine
<Silvermane> cuz she's so damn cute in socks. Fenrir and... oh my gosh, Flux is naked!
<ValtheJean> flux...?
<Shad> Le flux
<RobotPinkie> Someone's always going to be pissed, though.
<ValtheJean> acursed fanfic OCs....I don't know who they are but they annoy me already]
<Shad> and I'll love and tolerate the shit out of that person robot
<Denied_Existence> 3That reminds me...
<Denied_Existence> 3I gotta get some artist to make me an OC
<ValtheJean> EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
<Silvermane> ValtheJean, it was a reference to a Luna art image. She had named her hooves whilst on the moon
<Dermathil> >mfw Valthejean implies OCs are unilaterally bad
<ValtheJean> not you too Denied!
<ValtheJean> @Silvermane, ah
<Ghosties> 4Well
<ValtheJean> @Dermathil they are. period :P
<Denied_Existence> 3What? Is it bad to have a face?
<Ghosties> 4They can be bad
<Denied_Existence> 3I am not gonna write fan fiction with my own OC
<Silvermane> She named one Fenrir, which had a sock on, and the other Flux, who didn't, and she exclaimed that Flux was naked
<RobotPinkie> OCs are unilaterally OCs, and not canon. As long as people treat them as OCs, I'm fine with them.
<ValtheJean> gotcha
<Silvermane> ^
<Denied_Existence> 3Just have a face if you know what I mean
<Ghosties> 4Fun fact: I already have an OC
*Silvermane has a face
<Ghosties> 4From a few months ago
<Shad> i jelly
<ValtheJean> @RobotPinkie: tell that to the Nyx crazies....
<Silvermane> lol Nyx. i need to read that one still
<Dermathil> @valthejean: depends on the writer's abilities. Some OCs can be good.
<RobotPinkie> Well the Nyx crazies are... uh.... crazies...
<Silvermane> not like she can compete with baby Midnight though. She's my fave oc
<Shad> crazies are crazies
<Denied_Existence> 3*facehoof*
<Denied_Existence> 3Eeeup
<ValtheJean> @Dermathil: Well, since they all come from fanfics, I'm standing by my opinion
<Denied_Existence> 3Eeeyup*
<Denied_Existence> 3Hate it when my y key sticks
<Shad> Nope.avi
<desertman2> I want to read that fic, but I'm busy reading an unrelated fanfic
<RobotPinkie> Point being that "crazies" already implies that it's useless to try to tell them anything.
<Dermathil> @valthejean: Fallout: Equestria would probably change that opinion of yours, but seeing how big it is and how much you have fics I don't see that happening.
<Silvermane> oh Dermathil, you and FO:E
<ValtheJean> I'm half tempted to read it and prove you wrong
<Denied_Existence> 3OH GOD FO:E SHOULD BE A DAMN BOOK
<ValtheJean> but I'd rather not pollute my mind
<Silvermane> ValtheJean, DO IT FOAL
<Denied_Existence> 3ITS JUST THAT GOOD
<Pinkie_Pie> Rainbrodash, remove this laggy curse from my computer, or you will have horrible sea pony dreams.
<Shad> DO IT FOAL
<Shad> DO IT
<Silvermane> Denied_Existance it IS a damned book
<DamnedBook> 3Eeeyup
<RobotPinkie> DUMB FABRIC
<Dermathil> To everyone: Only fools don't change their minds.
<Silvermane> DamnedBook, tell me a story
<DamnedBook> 3Eeeeenope
<Silvermane> okay.jpg
<Shad> Nope.avi
*RobotPinkie reads a DamnedBook
<ValtheJean> @Dermathil: Only idiots change their mind without decent reasoning :P
<Silvermane> READ A BOOK READ A BOOK READ A MOTHA' FUCKIN' BOOK
*Shad READS A MOTHER FUCKING BOOK
<RainBroDash> 10"<Ghosties>: Fun fact: I already have an OC" I lol'd hard at this, and yoouu knooww whyy~ ;D <3
<interiorgummy> return of the parasprite
<Shad> FU SILVER
<Sumica> Thank you Silvermane, some one had to do it.
<Silvermane> lol, inb4 Shad
<DamnedBook> 3WAIT, WHAT!?
<interiorgummy> so how's the stream after the hurricane?
<Silvermane> not a problem Sumica, happy to be of service
<DamnedBook> 3Explain RBD
<RobotPinkie> and that someone thankfully wasn't me
<RainBroDash> 10DamnedBook no u
<Sumica> I would have done it but I was still eating lunch.
<ValtheJean> what happened to your "_" interiorgummy? :P
<Shad> I stole it
<Shad> and ate it
<ValtheJean> GIVE IT BACK SHAD
<ValtheJean> OR IMMA IMPALE YOU
<Shad> OMG MY LEFT FOOT IS COLD AGAIN
<Shad> WHAT THE FUUUUUUUU
<Dermathil> @valthejean: you can try FO:E to see who is right, and if you don't change your mind I will respect it. But usually someone needs to see both sides of the medal to make the best decision possible.
*AllisZero silently removes the ice bucket from under Shad's foot
<RobotPinkie> I read that as "gold"... Stay away from the Midas statue, dude
<Shad> my left foot is gold
<ValtheJean> alright Dermathil, let's work out the ground rules then
<RobotPinkie> FFFFFUUUUU
<Shad> MOTHER FU READ IT
<ValtheJean> how much of this atrocity do I need to read before being allowed to lock it in a dungeon and never EVER read it again?
<Sumica> FOREVER er wait that dosent work with that
<ValtheJean> (In other words, how long do you think it will supposedly take to catch my interest)(
<Shad> ALL of it
<Shad> kthx
<RobotPinkie> inb4 Val thinks FO:E is shit
<Shad> inb4val pretends he thinks FO:E is shit but he actually loves it
<ValtheJean> lol, I wont say anything RobotPinkie....except you're most likely right :P
*RainBroDash 10doesn't really like FO:E that much
*Silvermane is tired of the arguments on here. Some should stream something already.
<ValtheJean> lol Shad, inb4 I write a lengthy literary critique as to why FO:E is shit
<RainBroDash> 10thanks for the input silvermane
<RainBroDash> 10love it.
<herospirit> I'M BACK.
<RainBroDash> 10WELCOME BACK
<RainBroDash> 10:D
<DamnedBook> 3Even if you don't like it RBD, you have to admit he writes it really well.
<RobotPinkie> Soooo... Should I go play some more Time Crisis, or wait and see what Val thinks of FO:E?
<Silvermane> you're welcome RainBroDash, it loves you too. wb Herospirit
<herospirit> THANK YOU.
<Purple`Prose> Is it safe to link?
<herospirit> CAPITAL CAPITAL.
<ValtheJean> it's up to you, though I still don't have a rule on how much I have to actually read
<RainBroDash> 10DamnedBook yeah, but a lot of people glorify it like it should be able to turn all people towards fanfiction in general :P
<Sumica> ValtheJean: did't you learn anything from Bridal gossip?
<RobotPinkie> Decisions decisions...
<RainBroDash> 10I just don't agree
<DamnedBook> 3Well those people are stupid
<herospirit> So, I can beat Pony TouHou on normal mode. :0
<Silvermane> Read the first 5 chapters, go do that without commenting until you are done, tell us your opinion (not what quality it is) and then stop talking about it. Sound fair?
<ValtheJean> @Sumica I'm not judging a book by it's cover, I'm saying by definition I hate fanfics. And with that being said I'm actually offering to read the monstrosity
<DamnedBook> 3Just because a book is good, doesn't mean everyone should read it
<Shad> my first fanfic was cupcakes, didn't really make me want to read more fanfics
<Silvermane> Sumica: BRIDAL GOSSIP AHAHAAH I LOVED THAT ONE. Made me laugh and do the 'wtf am ireading' face several times
<herospirit> Though they only have 3 levels done though.
<ValtheJean> first 5 chapters? Fair enough. I can abide by this
<DSNesmith> my first fanfic was also cupcakes
<Silvermane> Shad, same; but i read 'Swayback Mountain' shortly after, and (besides learning i like shipping) it fixed my fear of fanfic
<RainBroDash> 10DamnedBook people do that though :P
<DSNesmith> but then I read Dangerous Business
<herospirit> I think Sumica means the Episode Sulvermane :0
<RobotPinkie> Well, also you'll have to tell me what you think when I'm back in an hour, ValtheJean :P
<ValtheJean> can I get a link or something? or do I have to browse through EQD >.<
<herospirit> Silvermane*
<Silvermane> ...
<RobotPinkie> I'll see you guys in a bit, I'm gonna go shoot some terrorists and their giant robots.
<Silvermane> oh fuck, Bridal Gossip, i was thinking it was Bridal Black
<Purple`Prose> http://youtu.be/ccTS6AtcxDo I hope Season 2's opening is something like this
<Silvermane> herospirit, thanks for pointing out my mistake
<Silvermane> i'm apparently hung over
<herospirit> Yah no prob. It's what I do
<ValtheJean> see ya later RobotPinkie
<Silvermane> if only i had gotten drunk last night
<Silvermane> peace Pinks
<herospirit> Silvermane is wasted like Twilight Sparkle.
<AllisZero> >Dat English Theme song
<AllisZero> My EAAAAARSSSSS
<Purple`Prose> >:D
<AllisZero> Why would you such a horrible thing to such a nice song
<AllisZero> do such*
<Shad> I love how her voice cracks on high notes
<AllisZero> I didn't go past the initial english notes
<Silvermane> EVERYONE
<Silvermane> this is the OFFICIAL Season 2 opening theme
<herospirit> YES?
<Silvermane> ENJOY
<Silvermane> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvNLjOuYSFQ

<ValtheJean> I don't even need to click that to know you're trolling
*Silvermane twirls his mustache, cackling.
<DSNesmith> is it a rick roll or something more original
<Silvermane> original
<DamnedBook> 3OH GOD MY EARS YOU BASTARD
<Shad> its more original
<Silvermane> it's 35 seconds, and hilarious
<Sumica> lol
<Purple`Prose> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST3_zUrcYGU here's my response
<Shad> RIP headphone users
<herospirit> THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL
<Silvermane> Purple`Prose, beautiful
<Sumica> If you love that then this could be better.
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XakZDXVcrrU
<Silvermane> shad, lol. i'm blaming Purple`Prose for reminding me of it
<DSNesmith> what the fuck
<herospirit> THAT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SONG I'VE HEAR IN MY LIFE. I AM CAPSLOCK LEVELS OF AMZED
<DSNesmith> lol
<DSNesmith> my ears
<desertman2> Fandup?
<Silvermane> ...
<Sumica> yes fandub
<Silvermane> Sumica... what am i watching? This is pretty smooth
<herospirit> Fan dupe
<Shad> I made the mistake of watching a fluttershy video before the season 2 introll
<Silvermane> japanese Rarity whine is PERFECT
<Shad> so I had my volume up
<herospirit> AHAHA the Japanese whining!
<herospirit> It's perfect!
<Purple`Prose> XD
<Silvermane> しかし私はあなたが泣き言望まれると考え
<AllisZero> The dogs are annoying
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZNqnsTf1f8
<Silvermane> (translation) but I thought you WANTED WHINING
<AllisZero> But Rarity is perfect
<Silvermane> Sumica... she sounds like a 10 year old
<AllisZero> Welcome to Japan
<Silvermane> like the little kid in Asumanga Daioh
<Shad> yfw in japanese DBZ goku is played by a woman
<Silvermane> ^ LAWL
<herospirit> Lol Japanese Pinky.
<AllisZero> Uh
<AllisZero> yfw Kenshin is also played by a woman
<Silvermane> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRF9DLr6x28&feature=related
<AllisZero> Naruto is also played by a woman
<AllisZero> And a slew of other male characters are also played by women
<Silvermane> let's just agree that all male leads are women in Japan
<herospirit> I cracked up on the noises Japanese Pinky made when she derped
<Shad> japanese people are fucked up
<Sumica> Most prepubescent male characters are played by women va's
<herospirit> By which you mean awesome, Shad?
<Purple`Prose> Dude, they have Takarazuka
<Silvermane> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb61JsF0z7U&feature=related

<Shad> I believe men should play men women should play women unless the character calls for the other genders voice
<ScaryPie> says hi
<AllisZero> Rainbow actually sounds very much like herself
<Purple`Prose> And they do awesome things. Like Phoenix Wright Musicals
<ScaryPie> :)

<Mazoot> OhIt'sTimeToClearMyKeyboardCuzSometingIsUnderMySpace
<Cat> even one from a vendor rather than a selfbuild

<Cam> Aristeo: I can do anything you can do in linux on osx.
<Sumica> Did you guys make sure to come up with a test to make sure Val did read it?
<RobotPinkie> controls are a bit meh, but the shooting is great.
*Jason distracts Cat with a quarter
<Cam> Not counting virtualization.
<Silvermane> Beautiful suits. and now Everybrony is laughing at me
<interiorgummy> celestia had a good prank 1000 years ago
<Silvermane> Sumica, i'm sure Dermathil can fact-check
<Cat> everything, at a ridiculously high markup for not very impressive hardware
<Jason> I can freely ald legally distribute the OS, can you do that with macs?

<Cat> I have a couple of linux ones already

<RobotPinkie> So can Val say how far along he is, or is he contractually forbidden from that too?
<Sumica> Re sung
<Cat> and a windows 98 one for playing certain old games
<Aristeo> And if Im happy with something then I dont like changing it ... I end up breaking stuff
<ValtheJean> I don't know, is he Silvermane? :P
<herospirit> VAL IS ALLOWED NOTHING.

<Luna> 7Poor val
<Cat> I think I've managed to break linux more thoroughly than I have windows so far
<Cam> The reason I prefer OSX to a linux flavor is because I absolutely hate Linux GUIs (and yes, I know you can customize them to pluto and back) but they just suck.
<Luna> 7*hugs him*
<Silvermane> RobotPinkie, agreement was no comments until finished, then a 'like it or lump it' opinion, but a status update is not restricted
<herospirit> GET BACK IN THE CAGE VAL.
<RobotPinkie> GIVE HIM NOTHING, BUT TAKE FROM HIM, EVERYTHING!
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzoAY2FyFCA&feature=related
<ValtheJean> indeed, poor Val :(
<ValtheJean> yay! Hugs!
<Cat> but... free
<Cat> D:
*ValtheJean hugs Luna
<Cam> And on top of that, the apps and menu intuitivity for mac apps is just stellar.
<Silvermane> Val is allowed to say how far he is along. 3 months?
<herospirit> LUNA. DO NOT TOUCH THIS CREATURE
<Jason> ubuntu 11.04 isnt too bad
<Cam> Indeed, but you have to get hardware somewhere
<Jason> just waay too slow
*Luna 7giggles happy
*Silvermane wishes he could get Luna hugs...
<Cam> And I personally don't mind mine.
<Dat_Pon-3> can i get a hug? :(
<ValtheJean> Val is half way through Chapter 2
<Silvermane> ah alrighty
<Cam> There's no need for more unless you game (or compile large projects)
*Luna 7Hugs the manechatroom
<Luna> 7there you go
<RobotPinkie> I wish I could get Luna hugs too :(
<Cat> can you actually replace every piece of hardware in a mac yet?
*Silvermane likes this plan
<Cam> And if you game on a computer you're wasting your life anyways.
<Dat_Pon-3> yay
<Cam> Cat: not at all.
<Jason> Cam: Or want a decent OS
<Cam> integrated graphics cards suck.
<Silvermane> :D Yay Luna hugs!
<Cam> Jason: i've had this argument with you before.
<Cam> Don't start it again.
<Jason> hehe
<Jason> fine
<Silvermane> the background singers sound so creepy in the deep voice
<Cat> pretty much all entertainment is a waste of time if you get down to it
<Dat_Pon-3> Luna better than celestia
<Cam> Because I will absolutely SHIT on yo for running UBUNTU on a motherfucking server.
<Cam> Cat: indeed ;)
<Cat> I have a very decent pc because I do a computer science degree and need a fast computer for compiling stuff
<Silvermane> Elusive's one was awesome
<Cat> it just happens that that same hardware also runs games awesomely
<Cam> Cat: then I would definitely recommend a computer customized for that.
<Cat> so I might as well, eh?
<Jason> if you dont wnat the server, I can just remove yer user ;)
<Cam> The MacPro (not macbookpro) is perfect for compiling.
<Jason> ubuntu is universal though
<Jason> I like tha
<Cam> Jason: want to?
<Jason> no
<Jason> :/
<Jason> I suppose not
<Cam> I'll copy my configs and leave if you'd like.
<Jason> nah
<Cat> the mac pro probably doesn't have a top of the range processor
<Cat> not that mine is anymore either
<RobotPinkie> Oh man I want to link to that Luna vid again...
<Cam> Cat: It has an i7 afaik
<Cat> still, a 3.4Ghz quad core is pretty good
<Cam> That's not shabby :>
<Sumica> They went with those names for the rule63 versions?
<Cat> I'm on amd
<Cat> Phenom II
<Jason> eww amd
<Silvermane> apparently Sumica
<Cat> shush, you
<Jason> :3
<Silvermane> (although i don't actually know them)
<Cat> with 8GB DDR3 ram and an nvidia GTX460
<Cat> not super-high spec, but still pretty nice
<Silvermane> somehow I think if Twilight really were male, there would be much more Princess shipping not involving Luna
<Jason> yeah, well I have a fucking hooker in my comp
<Jason> so fuck you
<herospirit> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plwwvM4LKGg&feature=related
<Sumica> I first ranacross those names from one of the Fics, Cross and arrow.
<Cat> I don't even want to think what it's like to clean up afterwards D:
<RobotPinkie> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ke_OYPsFnEQ/Tc4F4zbQ_qI/AAAAAAAAEcw/FA5eaLAJFjQ/s1600/12644+-+artist+C4tspajamas+rainbow_dash+sea_ponies+spitfire.png
<Silvermane> i'm waiting for that to finish so i can read it all in one go
<Cat> o.O
<Cat> ok, time to go poop now
<Cat> brb
<Jason> soo
<Silvermane> RobotPinkie, KILL IT WITH FIRE
<Cam> .....
<Pinkie_Pie> Sumica, what are the other Fanfics for it?
<ValtheJean> RobotPinkie you keep your god damn sea ponies to yourself!
<Sumica> Seaponies
<Jason> you know if you mix cornstarch and water, it makes this really cool gooey stuffy ?
<Jason> stuff *
<RobotPinkie> What? It's G4 fan art, and it's pretty good, too.
<Sumica> I dont know of any othere rule63 fics
<Silvermane> Hippocampi are abominations
<ValtheJean> SEA PONIES ARE ABOMINATIONS
<Silvermane> Sumica, there are a few, but that's the most famous
<Sumica> ahh
<Sumica> so I guess that would be why those names were used.
<RobotPinkie> Sea ponies are best ponies, clearly.
<Silvermane> RobotPinkie, troll harder. :D
*Sumica wonders how val can read two things at once.
<Purple`Prose> How long until showtime?
<RobotPinkie> Okay Silvermane, if you really want to
*Silvermane loves RobotPinkie and his antics
<ValtheJean> because it's so hard to stop reading mid-sentence?
<RobotPinkie> It really is a good pic though, Silvermane.
<Cat> non-newtonian fluid!
<Riders> ValtheJean = I thought My Little Pony was an abomination 10 months ago, yet here I am now.
<Cat> :D
<Sumica> it meens you are not focusing val =p
<Cat> also, I am now back from pooping
<Cat> just to be clear
<Cat> :|
<RobotPinkie> I mean I really don't see why people have such an aversion to it, it seems rather... silly.
<Silvermane> it is well drawn, but i can not be swayed by Dashfire that easilly
<ValtheJean> Sumica, have you been to university yet?
<Aristeo> o.o
<Silvermane> i dislike hippocampi for the sake of they creep me out, as do most sea creatures of the like.
<Riders> I wouldn't mind seeing Seaponies revamped for G4
<RobotPinkie> And indeed, Riders
<ValtheJean> I would
<Jason> Cat: You have experience with linking IRC server?
<ValtheJean> I have no desire to see sea ponies in G4
<RobotPinkie> Same here, I think the current MLP team would do it well.
<Jason> Servers *
<Cat> I have absolutely no idea when it comes to that
<Purple`Prose> Only as a one-off though, probably
<Silvermane> if they revamp it and make them less abomination-like, i could learn to accept them, but never like. too creepy
<Jason> oh :/
<Aristeo> Jasonnnnn just wait for meeee
<Cat> why?
<Jason> hurrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyy
<Jason> Cat: My servers wont link
<herospirit> GUYS. I KNOW WHO DISCORD IS.
<herospirit> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXWNV2wGu4
<Jason> uhh there is now cornstarch all over my air
<herospirit> HE IS THE SHMOOZE
<RobotPinkie> But that's kind of my point, Silvermane, if they're done in G4 style then how are they abominations?
<herospirit> NOTHING CAN STOP HIM
<Silvermane> shmooze...?
<Silvermane> that sound...
<RobotPinkie> I wouldn't want to see G1 sea ponies in G4, either. :P
<Silvermane> it hurts my soul
<RobotPinkie> That would be the scariest thing of all time.
<Silvermane> herospirit, my soul hurts from that sound
<Riders> Unless the Smooze is a Doctor Who Eldridge abomination, I want nothing to do with it
<mib_ufdpyd> anons gonna anon
<herospirit> YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT
<Cat> it could be worse, you could have had wood dust in your eyes like me a couple days ago
<Silvermane> RobotPinkie, horses are not meant to not have legs. that is why. i'm just gonna sit here
<Cat> that really hurt
<Jason> o.o
<herospirit> I actually wrote a few paragraphs of Grimdarkness about the smooze.
<herospirit> For shits and giggles.
<Jason> how?
<RobotPinkie> Horses aren't meant to have wings, either. :P
<Cat> me and dad were shoveling up some leftover wood pellets from his work to take home and use as bedding for the horses
<herospirit> Posted it in the pony thread on the MSPA forums. :p
<Silvermane> yes, but those are more natural from mythology
<Cat> it was in a big pile and we were shovelling it into the trailer
<Cat> about 2 tonnes in all
<herospirit> When someone else posted the smooze video. :0
<RobotPinkie> But... mythological sea horses...
<Jason> :O YOU HAVE HORSES?
<Cat> and we had masks on to avoid breathing it in, but it still went in my eyes
<ValtheJean> there is no mythology involving sea ponies essentially. They're just a stupid twist of mermaids and sea horses
<Jason> :O YOU HAVE HORSES?
<Cat> yes
<Cat> D:
<Jason> http://ytalk.co.cc/other
<Jason> look at my picc
<Cat> well, one horse and one pony
<herospirit> Something bad is coming down, have you heard the news?
<herospirit> NOTHING CAN STOP. THE SMOOZE.
<Jason> ^^
<Cat> are you 12?
<Jason> 14
<Jason> :3
<Cat> I'm not keen on horses, myself
<Jason> I already told you like 8403948-394-84509372543583487 times
<Cat> they do not seem trustworthy
<Jason> I like horses
<Denied_Existence> 3Orly?
<Cat> I think pigs are pretty cool
<Cat> we have those too
<Jason> I think they come into your house, and eat your money when you away
<Jason> or asleey

<Denied_Existence> 3D'AAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWW
<Cat> I think cows are hilarious
<ValtheJean> FWEAKIN saved
<Cat> they look so ridiculous
<Silvermane> RobotPinkie, i dunno. I just don't like them, just like Mindflayers/Illithids terrify me, water makes me nervous, and wolves fill me with pride. just how i am
<Cam> This chat is pointless.

<Denied_Existence> 3Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyup
<DecapPony> say hi to luna's mechanical dolphin for me
<Cat> Don't get me wrong, I would absolutely use Linux for running a server machine
<Cat> but I don't think it's a great choice for a personal entertainment machine
<Denied_Existence> 3TO THE MOON'S MOON
<ValtheJean> moonception?
<Cat> it's also pretty great for smartphones in the form of Android

<Nittany_Tiger> White squares are scary.
<Pinkie_Pie> Wouldnt recommend clicking it
<Nice_ScaryPie> thats was just my drivers license
<desertman2> No, I saw the URL
<DecapPony> is it because sathi is on the moon?
<Denied_Existence> 3So...Wrek, what gender do you want ValtheJean to be?
<herospirit> It's not really all that scary /:I
<Nice_ScaryPie> you guys hurt my feelings
<Denied_Existence> 3Sathi said no, so I say no
<Pinkie_Pie> Should I play Silent Hill 2 or Just Cause 2?
<Ghosties> 4Silent Hill 2
<RobotPinkie> I guess I'm the one person in the world who doesn't think deflated hair Pinkie Pie is a psycho killer.
<DecapPony> just cause 2 is pretty good
<Nice_ScaryPie> your supposed to love and tolerate everyone
<Pinkie_Pie> Darn..
<Riders> Silent Hill 2
<Pinkie_Pie> I still havent gotten past the apartment
<Nice_ScaryPie> no matter how disturbing and pshycho i look
<DecapPony> i couldnt play silent hill 2
<Pinkie_Pie> Nor have I found the flashlight
*Dermathil is fansquealing for the random gift he just recieved

<DecapPony> is it Metro 2033?
<Silvermane> RobotPinkie, depends on how psycho she is
<Pinkie_Pie> What kind of gift Dermathil?
<Nice_ScaryPie> well im nice psycho right now
<Nice_ScaryPie> <----
<DecapPony> im just a sociopath
<RobotPinkie> She isn't psycho on the show though, Silvermane, or what do you mean?
<Wrek> 5>implyign that Denied_Existence should randomize stuff
<ValtheJean> Hey everyponyt
<ValtheJean> there's a backup stream up
<ValtheJean> http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BronyStateAlternative
*Nittany_Tiger takes a sociopath
<RobotPinkie> everyponyta?
<ValtheJean> feel free to tune in if you'd like
<DecapPony> we know
<Nice_ScaryPie> anyone wanna see my family photo?
<Dermathil> Pinkie_Pie: I just got gifted METRO 2033 on steam by another brony!!!!!
<Pinkie_Pie> Ghostie
<Ghosties> 4Yes, Pinkie?
<Pinkie_Pie> Do I really have to play SH2?
<Dermathil> been trying to get that hand for months now!!!
<Pinkie_Pie> Im running around in the dark on it
<Pinkie_Pie> Without a flashlight
<DecapPony> They should of made Metro more of a free roam type game
<Ghosties> 4No. I just suggested it, you don't have to play it
<Pinkie_Pie> No health drinks
<Pinkie_Pie> No hope
<Silvermane> RobotPinkie, she is implied to be going unhinged during that scene, and it may have degraded further, but it didn't. but then fanfics make it funnier/worse so who knows
<Pinkie_Pie> Dermathil, that was nice of them
<Pinkie_Pie> But Metro 2033 is stressful
<Pinkie_Pie> Running around trying to keep from suffocating
<DecapPony> Stalker is even more so
<Dermathil> indeed it was, Pinkie_Pie. Got 30 hours in STALKER, loving the atmosphere. I actually wanted to play Metro instead of STALKER originally
<herospirit> Now DANCE FUCKER DANCE, he never had chance. And no one even knew, it was really only you! So DANCE FUCKER DANCE, I never had a chance, It was really only you... WITH A THOUSAND LIES, AND A GOOD DISGUISE, hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes, When you walk away, nothing more to say, See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em runnin...
<DecapPony> with all of those anomilies, mutants, bandits, and radiation, bleed effects, etc
<herospirit> That song is STILL in my head.
<herospirit> Blarglarglarg
<Mazoot> Herospirit Offspring rulez
<DecapPony> its cause its an epic song
<Dermathil> due to some mechanics with some of the monsters (I heard of a monster that don't attack if you don't look at it?)
<RobotPinkie> Yeah unhinged, sure, but not full blown psycho. I know what the fanfics have made it into, but well... I don't think fanfics are canon. :P
<Denied_Existence> 3!nicks
<DecapPony> my internet provider got pissed cause i torrented stuff
<Denied_Existence> 3DAMN YOU DARIBOT
<Denied_Existence> 3Y U NO WORK!?
<Riders> Is it just me or is the stream a bit quiet?
<Dermathil> Fanfics are never canon. They are a good read, but if there is one thing they aren't, it is canon.
<ValtheJean> seems fine to me
<DecapPony> wait in metro or stalker dermathil?
<RobotPinkie> Yeah it's a bit quiet for me too, Riders
<Pinkie_Pie> Cupcakes is canon and you know it. Dashies number just hasnt come up yet
<RobotPinkie> Yeah right.
<Mazoot> Abacus is canon
<DecapPony> cause i rememver monster like that from Metro i think
<Pinkie_Pie> Rainbow Factory is canon
<CopperCogs> Anyone know how to get synchtube to work?
<ValtheJean> Caramel being Alpha is canon
<Nice_ScaryPie> anyone wants my cupcakes
<CopperCogs> cause it won't even load the homepage for me
<RobotPinkie> Cameras are canon
<Nice_ScaryPie> take them or i'll get angry
<RobotPinkie> or Canon, rather
<DecapPony> abacus is the best pwnie ever
<Nice_ScaryPie> you wouldnt like me when im angry

*Applejack sings with Amino AND Sotha
<ValtheJean> @Gandalf_The_White honestly, meh. The game isn't even that fun without the expansions
<Sumica> Buy? an EA product?
<CopperCogs> Depends on how much you like sims
*Gollum 11loves The Sims, but that's because his own life is too dull to care about. :P
<Ziltoid> The sims is bad and you should feel bad
<Legolas> 3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/630.gif

<Applejack> nah
<Gandalf_The_White> 4And yes, Sumica. "BUY" an EA product. Sure, their marketing attempts are a bit rubbish, and they occasionally produce bad titles
<ValtheJean> @Ghosties(becauseIdon'twanttospelloutGandalf_The_WhitewhichisironicbecauseIjustdidandnowwastedspace) if you like it and are willing to feed the massive whore that is EA, go ahead
<Smeagol> 6Reload your PAGE, I said. Not the stream.
