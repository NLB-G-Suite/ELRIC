<Eowyn> 14One does not simply trot into Mordor!
<Gimli> 11I call bias. It's an elf telling the tale.
*ValtheWizard 0Enchants Ron_Weasley's wand with his uber magicks

<Reaver21> Tis' but a flesh wound!
<Galadriel> sorry so many names I got lost :P

<ValtheWizard> 0Galadriel just wanted eternal night!
*Jason quickly takes Cat's eye out and puts it in a special jar
<TehRing> BOOM
<Radagast> That was easy
<Aponymous> Getting Sauron in Battle For Middle Earth 2 and roflstomping your enemies army is one of the best feelings in the world.
<Gandalf> It's fine
<eeveesprit> i think discord will be brown
<Ron_Weasley> 10i suggest you post in colours
<Tictac> 00@Radagast I loved Hades

<Dermathil> boom! Rimshot
<Amorphic> WOO, just started
<Crainy> thats a helmet
<PrincessCelestia> I think discord is a spirt inside a armor
<Eowyn> Colors are the only thing I can keep track of lol
<Obama> humm
<Gandalf> 4I'm thinking about posting in gray
<Gandalf> 4Since
<Eowyn> 14There
<Gandalf> 4you know
<Samwise> I imagine Discord ot be like the peacock from Kung Fu Panda 2. Serious and dark, but not evil.
<Galadriel> 7good suggestion
<Gandalf> 4Gandalf the Gray
<Eowyn> 14Hey!
<Eowyn> 14:P
<Edwardnewgate> I never understood why the Gods didn't just help defeat Sauron, he was a bitch compared to Morgoth
<Boromir> 12COLORS AND CRUISE CONTROL!
<InsertCupcake> Falcon Kick
<Razyn> 0Discord has to be a big ham.
<Gandalf> 4Sorry Eowyn :D

<eeveesprit> when i hear discord...i think about some kind of nigger pony for some reason
<Amorphic> How long are all 3 movies extended editions? 21 years?
<EspyLacopa> ReticentSmolder: I think he was making a joke.
<Aponymous> Discord better be hammier than Trixie, that's all I'm saying.
<Ersatz> He be trollin', ReticentSmolder
<Eowyn> 14I want pink, but Peanut has it :P
<Crainy> like 8 hours
<ReticentSmolder> trololol
<Swanto2> This is amazing
<Edwardnewgate> Dermathil Bullshit, Have you read the Sillmarillion?
<Dat_Pon-3> hes dead jim
<Ziltoid> DEAD
<Gandalf> 14Just switch to pink
<TehRing> well shit son
<Gandalf> 14He's never here
<Radagast> Discord is supposed to be seductive in a way. How will he do that if he looks like Megasatan?
<Ron_Weasley> 10xD
<Riders> So basically, the world is at risk because people are dicks.
<Elky> reticent: that's stupid, the movies came out after 2000 and there were many rpgs before that
<Gandalf> 14And if he is, he's lurking and not signing in
<TehRing> myth
<Thetrollside> 0@samwise read the screenplay demo, he is dark as shit, he tries to turn the mane 6 against eachother and even kill
<The_Si> Way to give us men a bad name.
<Ersatz> He's that good, Radagast

<Shad> if everyone was a brony in the world
<Ron_Weasley> 10Oh god so you guys are going to post in the wrong colours?
<Rezo> >two and a half thousand years of ZERO technological advancement in middle earth
<Eowyn> 14Someone posted in pink a sec ago I thought...
<PrincessCelestia> I wonder discord looks like hexxus from ferngully lol
<Shad> the world would be at peace
<ValtheWizard> 0@Edwardnewgate the gods could only interfere with other gods. In addition, the entire Noldor got banished because they intervened
<Ron_Weasley> 10I have no idea who anyone is
<Samwise> when Peter Jackson submitted these films for PG-13 ratings, he was laughing for years.
<Dermathil> nope, EdwardNewGate.
<Meanwhile> For two and a half thousand years, we made no technological advances what so ever
<Obama> so Aristeo how is life treating you
<RobotPinkie> Crackin open a beer. So what's the drinking game this time? :P

<Gimli> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Originally the narration at the prologue was to be spoken by Elijah Wood, but it was felt that the information imparted had little bearing on the character of Frodo.

<Bjornfot> SPOILER: PEGACORN IS MY BITCH WHO LIKES MMMM BIG BLACK STALLION-BANANAS
<Dat_Pon-3> Trixie would pwn gandalf
<Samwise> The Hobbit will be the most famous movie of the decade. I'm predicting the future here.
<EspyLacopa> I really liked watching the extras and how much they put into using fancy props to achieve the various special effects instead of computer graphics.
<PrincessCelestia> The Great and Powerful Gandalf!
<Madadude> Total Trixie magic right there
<eeveesprit> let's all eat bannana's
<Crainy> WITNESS THE POWER OF

*Ron_Weasley 10was right after all
<Dermathil> Alrighty. 'Cause that's the one trivia I know pretty much by heart
<Combustiblelemons> now for gandalf's weed pipe
<Spazturtle_> FUN FACT: Frodo is ment to be in his mid 40's
<Gimli> 11RANDOM PERSPECTIVE TRIVIA: The hobbits needed to appear about three to four feet tall - tiny compared with the seven-foot Gandalf. This was often accomplished using forced perspective, placing Ian McKellen (Gandalf) consistently closer to the camera than Elijah Wood in order to trick the eye into thinking McKellen is towering.
<sotha> Well, you won't find any bananas here. But I know where you can find some!
<Eowyn> 13Ugh

<Gandalf> 15Now, now, my dear Dat_Pon-3, why would you say such a thing?
<RobotPinkie> I've invented a great drinking game for this movie. Basically, whenever you feel like it, drink.
<Dat_Pon-3> i like the arrow guy
<Dat_Pon-3> whats his name?
<ValtheWizard> 0lol, that's the real reason the mods changed their names
<Legolas> 3Eeveesprit WAIT...WHAT!?
<Eowyn> 13Unless theres another color we're not currently using
<ValtheWizard> 0to make it INCREDIBLY difficult for chat :P
<sotha> Oh wow. I can see the forced perspective. It's weird.
<InsertCupcake> RobotPinkie: its called alcohol poisoning
<EspyLacopa> So, if you had the money, would you live in a hobbit hole?
<Ersatz> There's some cheese here...!
<Crainy> i need something to chew on....

<Ron_Weasley> 10red... ghosties' colour
<Dermathil> hahaha
<Ziltoid> OH
<Gimli> 11RANDOM PERSPECTIVE TRIVIA: In order to make "forced perspective" a bit more interesting, the filmmakers devised a totally new system consisting of a pulley and a platform. When the camera moved (which is normally impossible as the forced perspective would become obvious) the actor(s) also moved.
<Madadude> bonk
<Razyn> 0Tall people...
<eeveesprit> yes, he must hide the porn before he came in
<Dat_Pon-3> hes played by orlando bloom

<Ersatz> No clue why
<Shad> if gandalf came to my house i'd yell YOU SHALL NOT PASS
<Gimli> 11RANDOM MAP TRIVIA: The map Gandalf picks up in Bilbo's study is a reproduction of the map J.R.R. Tolkien drew for the book "The Hobbit".

<Purple`Prose> Was Gandalf whacking his head in the script?

<InsertCupcake> RobotPinkie: I wish I had some but ive gotta save some money for going out tomorrow
<Gandalf> 15I'm not that meanspirited, Meanwhile
<Gimli> 11RANDOM HEAD-CEILING TRIVIA: Gandalf's painful encounter with a ceiling beam in Bilbo's hobbit-hole was not in the script - Ian McKellen banged his forehead against the beam accidentally, not on purpose. But Peter Jackson thought McKellen did a great job "acting through" the mistake, and so kept it in.
<Dat_Pon-3> flutterpeanut lol
<DragonRage> Hiya Flutterpeanut
<Flutterpeanut> 13Ohai.
<Meanwhile> I forget that gandalf can answer
<Samwise> Gimli: That's actually awesome

<Meanwhile> That's the understatement of the day bilbo.

<Meanwhile> You're 111
<Riders> Gandalf and Magneto. 2 different ends of the wise old man spectrum.
<ValtheWizard> 0ah god damn it
<Gimli> 11RANDOM PERSPECTIVE TRIVIA: When you see Frodo and Gandalf sitting on a cart at the beginning, forced perspective means that Elijah Wood is 3 feet behind Ian McKellen.

<Gimli> 11RANDOM GANDALF TRIVIA: Ian McKellen hadn't read the books when he was first approached by Peter Jackson to play Gandalf. It was Jackson's enthusiasm for the project that won him over.

<Pegacorn> I CAN RUN AWAY FROM ANYTHING I WANT
<sotha> RAINBOOM
<Dermathil> EPIC FIREWORKS
<Combustiblelemons> i wish they'd play the safety dance.
<Rezo> nuclear fireworks
<EspyLacopa> Dragon firework is best firework.
<Gandalf> 15As well as firework explosions
<desertman2> Is it just me or do you hear dings?
<DragonRage> Gandalf makes the best fireworks.
<Madadude> trolls gonna troll
<Samwise> Arguing trolls
<Dermathil> Dat reciting of the troll scene
<InsertCupcake> THE WHISTLES GO WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Spazturtle_> Tree Trolls, remember that
<Tictac> 00Why did they use any of the fireworks in battle?
<Elky> dem hobbit references
*Ron_Weasley 10had a really great local Yorkshire Ale with his dinner in the pub.
<Crainy> i was afk

<Razyn> 0Gandalf, you so tall

<EmmettBrown> Hi guys,Am I late?
<Spazturtle_> Three Stone Trolls
<Eowyn> 14Shoot, needs moar bright colors
<Samwise> You don't even need to edit that scene for it to make sense.
<EspyLacopa> Sam is Frodo's loyal ninja.
<Dermathil> Tictac: they didn't have any on hand?
<The_Si> CHILLI...
<Meanwhile> Fool of a took
<Odin> 0TROLLS
<Aragorn> 8told him we're just gonna use the skype chat

<Nittany_Tiger_> Butterflies go to houses. Burn houses down.
<RobotPinkie> dat facial expression
<Dat_Pon-3> they jacking fireworks
<Kenko> Actually, that did happen... Gandalf confused the trolls by imitating their voices.
<Razyn> 0EmmettBrown, what an odd thing for someone like you to say
<Shad> Gandalf VS Twilight
<Shad> WHO WINS
<Tictac> 00Man they would have been so useful
<Dermathil> INCOMING PROBLEM
<Razyn> 0Shad, Twilight
<Legolas> 3Eeveesprit LIKE A BAWWSS
<InsertCupcake> This wasn't what I expected a-tall
<Combustiblelemons> Gandalf wins. Flawless victory
*Gimli 11loves the extended footage
<Totalwar57> twitchy twitch
<Samwise> Gandalf's fireworks > Fred&George's fireworks (sorry Ron_Weasley
<Ersatz> Lemons ^
<Dat_Pon-3> no contest Twilight Sparkle
<Ron_Weasley> 10I can't use skype and stream most likely. It's already skipping enough already
<EspyLacopa> Dragon Firework!
<Shad> i'm happy for ya'll and ima let you finish
<Edwardnewgate> FOAL OF TOOK
<Crainy> hes on drugs again
<Dat_Pon-3> wins
<EspyLacopa> dat apple
<Rodman> Arrived just in time!
<Shad> but twilight is one of the most magical ponies of all time
<Gimli> 11It really adds to the story.
<Shad> OF ALL TIME
*Gandalf 4also enjoys the extended edition
<Bjornfot> So how long is this film?
<Ron_Weasley> 10Samwise you know that's not true
<Ersatz> Twilight doesn't have the pipeweed skills to take on Gandalf.
<EspyLacopa> Something like 4 hours, Bjornfot.
<PrincessCelestia> I think 3 hours
*Dermathil also enjoys the extended edition.
<Gandalf> 4I must admit, I've never seen the extended editions
<Gimli> 11RANDOM PIPPIN TRIVIA: During Bilbo's party Pippin can be seen in the band playing a guitar.
<durger> i want some of that homebrew :(
<RobotPinkie> So this is extended? nice
*Razyn 0only likes extended footage on a movie he's seen
<Ziltoid> I WUBWOO
<Dat_Pon-3> movies like 5 hours of walking to a volcano
<Purple`Prose> Nice
<Samwise> Gandalf would be a gent and let Twilight win, but he could beat her at any time.
<Amorphic> SPOILER: Sauren dies in 2 days
<EspyLacopa> It's long enough that it's on 2 DVDs.
<Dermathil> OH YES!!!!
<Crainy> i have seen the extended editions
<Dermathil> INCOMING
*WhatPayne agrees with the mods
<Crainy> i have seen them often
<Kenko> Gandalf is a Maiar,,, close to a deity.with many millenia of experience... I'd reluctantly have to give the win to him.
<Legolas> 3ITS A FLYING TENT YEAH
<eeveesprit> fail
<Crainy> they are WAAAAY better then the originals
<Combustiblelemons> ROCKET TENT :D
<Dat_Pon-3> i love the Clerks 2 description of these movies
<Odin> 0theyre doin it right
<Rezo> Dwagonssssssssssssssssssss
<Samwise> does this video have the cut between the two discs?
<Combustiblelemons> TENTS IN SPAAAAACEEE
<Crainy> i mean, they are like 20% better
<Beat> Shit be on fire, yo.
<Ron_Weasley> 10I bought her a flying tent. Bitches love flying tents.
<Gimli> 11RANDOM SCREAM TRIVIA: When the dragon firework goes off at the party, the shriek heard is Billy Boyd actually screaming, as he was unaware at the time that the firework was really going to explode on set (he thought that it would be put in digitally). It was not scripted, but that take ended up in the final film.
<RobotPinkie> Extended is the intended version
<Crainy> if not 50%
<RobotPinkie> Theatrical is balls
<EspyLacopa> Gandalf would win a duel with Twilight while showing less power than Trixie.
<Crainy> or even 80%
*Pegacorn tries to run away from Bjornfot but falls on his face
<CriticKitten> Yay, the fireworks almost killed us! :D
<Gandalf> 4Now now
<Dat_Pon-3> busted
<Odin> 0THEY CAME
<Samwise> >inb4 if Tom Bombadil was tree, then who was fone?
<Crainy> Return of the King is almost an hour longer
<Legolas> 3YOU SHALL NOT GET AWAY PEGACORN
<Shad> I can't tell where gandalf's hair ends and where his beard begins
<RobotPinkie> Well not really, theatrical cuts are pretty good...
<Madadude> SPEEEECH
<Legolas> 3IT IS IMPOSSIBURU
<MirthTinker> are we going to be able to see the car in the background later? :P
<Dat_Pon-3> now time to smoke Wizard Weed
<Ron_Weasley> 10SPEEEEEEEEEECH
<Tictac> 00Spike was celestia?
<Edwardnewgate> I don't usually set off fireworks, but when I do, they're giant fucking DRAGON fireworks
<Ersatz> ...So Fluttershy wishes she was Tom Bombadil?
<Bjornfot> Oh Pegacorn... why are you running fro me? You liked what we did last week, didn't you?
<Gimli> 11RANDOM HOBBIT HAIR TRIVIA: Every actor in the film wore a wig apart from Billy Jackson, the director's toddler son, seen listening wide-eyed to a tale told by Bilbo Baggins at his birthday party, had the perfect Hobbit hair.
<EspyLacopa> Ah, Merry and Pippin.
<Legolas> 3Did he say drugs...?
<eeveesprit> YES WE CAN
*Thetrollside 0shoots pegacorn in the leg
<PrincessCelestia> holy!
<Kenko> If FLuttershy wants to be a tree, would Bombadil want to be a Fluttershy?
<Gandalf> 4I'm well aware that the one known as Trixie is quite the egotistical wizard and you would all like to see me put her in her place. But I am an honorable gray, I will not do such things
<EmmettBrown> eleventyone
<Purple`Prose> Bilbo is badass :D
<Razyn> 0Did he just say 11tee one?
<Gimli> 11Tom Bombadil
<RobotPinkie> I thought we could, but it turns out those other guys are assholes.
*Pegacorn is limping
<InsertCupcake> Trixiue is badass
<Totalwar57> Bombadil is fluttershy
<InsertCupcake> Trixie*
<Aragorn> 8http://i.imgur.com/GH2YA.png
<Pegacorn> Damnitdamnitdamnit.
<Crainy> Gandalf
<Edwardnewgate> Gandalf, yfw Trixie could beat your ass in a magic fight
<Dat_Pon-3> :o
<Crainy> STOP HIM
<Legolas> 3Bjornfot Orly? I want to see this fiction....
<Crainy> ....
<Crainy> TENTION
<Dat_Pon-3> HES GOT A GUN!
<Amorphic> ITS A TRAP
<Crainy> THE END
<Crainy> thats it
<Crainy> bye
<EspyLacopa> Heh
<Ersatz> An hero, he was.
<Tictac> 00Gandalf could fist fight and ursa major
<Purple`Prose> POOF!
<MirthTinker> @Gimli, will you mention the car edited out in the corn field, huh huh huh?
<justthisponyyouknow> goodbye
<EspyLacopa> Nice line.
<Combustiblelemons> I must go! my home planet needs me!
<Radagast> Radagast the Brown

<Bjornfot> Sorry Legolas, didn't save it.
<Ron_Weasley> 10ITS A TARP
<Dat_Pon-3> MINDFREAK!!!!!!!!!!!!1
<eeveesprit> CHAOS CONTROL
<justthisponyyouknow> gasp
<Gandalf> 4Oh, that mischievous Bilbo
<Odin> 0MAGIC
<Samwise> That doesn't make sense though, Tom bombadil is Fluttershy in the movies, but in the books he's definitely more of Pinkie Pie
<Gandalf> 4Always turning invisible
<Shad> ursas don't have fists
<DragonRage> Guess I'll go play some TF2 instead.
<Spazturtle_> Wat da fuck!?
<Shad> PAWS!
<RobotPinkie> Good movie guys, so now ponies?
<Pegacorn> I NEED SOME HELP HERE!
<Dermathil> ITS A TARMAC!!!!!
<Aragorn> 8http://i.imgur.com/eduam.png
*Legolas 3crys.
<Crainy> chaos control... nice one
<Odin> 0I DIDNT AUTHORIZE THIS SHIT
<Radagast> dammit to hell. I couldn't find any pizza.
<Gandalf> 4I think it's time I take his toy away from him, it's my turn with it
<DragonRage> Wait what sorcery is this?!
<Odin> 0THIEF OF RUNES
<Meanwhile> Hahahaha, i'm playing with the fabric of reality
<Kenko> He's not actually in the movies that I can remember.
<Madadude> The Precious!!!!
<eeveesprit> Crainy thnx
<EmmettBrown> I think we are all missing the main point here...
<CriticKitten> Gandalf has ranks in ninja as well as wizard
<Bjornfot> Legolas, are you new to Brony Movie Night?
<Kenko> AND in Swordman.
<Legolas> 3eeenope
<Shad> 2nd week here for me, sadly I missed the others
<Shad> D:
<Boromir> 12Gandalf is multiclass? What sorcery is this?
<EmmettBrown> When was the last time you saw a completely round door?
<Gimli> 11RANDOM TREE TRIVIA: The large tree that stands above Bag End was built especially by the production department. Every leaf had to be manually attached.
<Gandalf> 4Sorcery?
<Crainy> BTW
<Purple`Prose> Gandalf is Gestalt
<Kenko> very much an NPC type.
<Crainy> one thing i can not wait for in the hobbit
<Crainy> is
<Crainy> Saruman
<Gandalf> 4My dear lad, I'm Gandalf the Gray. My experience spans the lifetime of a thousand men
<Tictac> 00I feel bad for the production department.
<Legolas> 3Why do you ask Bjornfot?
<Ziltoid> inb4 devil baggins

<Shad> SHIT JUST GOT NORMAL AGAIN
<Aponymous> Note to self: Don't piss off the wizard.
<CriticKitten> I like how Bilbo's like "o.o hold me"
<eeveesprit> gandalf is helping him, LIKE A BAAAWS
<Gandalf> 4I also have a degree in lighting
<Bjornfot> Legolas, D_E?
<Samwise> Hold me, like you did by the lake in Naboo
<Combustiblelemons> let go of your hate
<Legolas> 3Denied_Existence
<Purple`Prose> <Bilbo> "I think I wet 'em."
<Radagast> Tolerate and love the shit out of Bilbo
<RobotPinkie> Gandalf is Trixie, it's official
<Combustiblelemons> become a brony
<Crainy> Gandalf is like
<Pegacorn> I CHALLENGE YOU GANDALF.I AM 128 YEARS OLD.I AM THE OLDEST PONY IN THIS CHATROOM.I HAVE LEVERAGE GANDALF.DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH LEVERAGE TO BE OLDER THAT ME?
<Crainy> WTF
<Bjornfot> o mk
<Spazturtle_> Twighlight does that in S2
<RainbowLoon> the GREAT and POWERFULL Gandalf
<Ersatz> Wizards are subtle and... awww screw it, DARK BOOMING VOICE!
<Dat_Pon-3> "Show me the that magic wand ITS MY NEW PRECIOUS!"
<Edwardnewgate> THE GREATER AND MORE POWERFUL TRIXIE
<Gandalf> 4Pegacorn, I do not take challenges lightly
<Crainy> epic music
<Purple`Prose> ACCIO RING!
<Gimli> 11RANDOM CHAPTER TRIVIA: The chapter titles "A Long-expected Party", "A Short Cut to Mushrooms", "The Bridge of Khazad-dum", "Lothlorien", and "The Breaking of the Fellowship" from "The Fellowship of The Ring" are spoken lines at their respective points in the storyline with the exception of "The Breaking of The Fellowship" which is foreshadowed during
<Odin> 0WHY CANT I QUIT YOU GANDALF
<Gimli> 11during the scene at "The Mirror of Galadriel". "Riddles In The Dark" is also mentioned - the name of a chapter from "The Hobbit". In the extended version released on DVD, the prologue title "Concerning Hobbits" was mentioned by Ian Holm (Bilbo) in the opening scenes at Bag End - before the first chapter is named.
<InsertCupcake> tone change
<EmmettBrown> Dat ring
<Riders> Oh that Bilbo!!
<Kenko> Gee, thanks, Uncle Bilbo, for RUINING MY LIFE WITH TAT DAMN RING.
<Rezo> Rings. Better than crack

<Samwise> In a world of magnets and miracles
<Crainy> what are the "Two Towers"?
<Shad> the answer is pi
<Dat_Pon-3> HES JACKING YO RING BILBO!
<Gimli> 11You can already see Bilbo aging a bit in that shot.
<Bjornfot> Legolas... I don't think anypony else would call it a "pleasure"
<EmmettBrown> Not what I wanted to imagine
*Pegacorn runs away screaming "WUBUBUBUBUBU"
<Legolas> 3>mfw Pony ad...
<Bjornfot> Dman was never the same after...
<Gandalf> 4Well

<Samwise> Watching LordoftheRings...Peter Jackson was original producer of Halo movie...117 viewers
<EspyLacopa> And thus, Frodo is corrupted.
<Dat_Pon-3> brought him to the old folks home
<EmmettBrown> Gandalf is good with that pipe,but James May is better.

<Kenko> Mordor isn't known for the sleekness of it's archetecture...
<DragonRage> Man, why must the volume be so inconsistent?
<EmmettBrown> It's like a cross between icecrown and the Burning Steppes
<Shad> I live in michigan

<Meanwhile> Gandalf is gandalf
<Pegacorn> YAY!ARAGORN HAS APPEARED.
<DSNesmith> Gandalf is Twilight, Saruman is Trixie
<Elky> Gandalf's Celestia
<Gandalf> 4My findings were less than joyous
<Ersatz> Gandalf is Woona.
<RobotPinkie> But wait
<mobileDCD> Dermathil: got to read it for my lit class
<mobileDCD> Because if there's something that med school needs, it's a lit class
<mobileDCD> I don't mind that much. Except it's 1200 pages long. So yeah
*Aragorn 8has been here the whole time
<Elky> at least personality-wise
<Eowyn> 14Woona <3
<Samwise> I had a dream that Discord was a pony version of Sauron and everybody in the world converted because the first S2 episode was so epic.
<eeveesprit> gandalf is everpony
<RobotPinkie> How the fuck does Gandalf use magic? He's no unicorn.
<Bjornfot> Gandalf is Trixie and Twilight's child.
<Kenko> He packs Twilight's brains with Trixie's style.. and Celestia's talent for not giving enough damn information.
<CriticKitten> It could be worse. Sauron could've called on Nightmoon Moon instead of the ring.
<DSNesmith> Gandalf has a horn under his hat
<PrincessCelestia> that would be awsome
<Dat_Pon-3> doesnt he get his head chopped off?

<Meanwhile> Gandalf is quite cool
<Tictac> 00@sam but what killed King kong
<Nittany_Tiger_> Fuck, it's hot!
<Crainy> pulling out your hand is cool?
<DSNesmith> "Whoops, not the ring then"
<RobotPinkie> It's at least 20% cooler than other rings
<lemonloaf> so
<Gandalf> 4@Meanwhile: DO HO HO
<Starbuck> @Meanwhile the beauty
<lemonloaf> the real question is
<Bjornfot> Gimli... US only jumped into WW2 at the last minute and then claimed to have "saved" us all because they were retards who wanted to appear cool.
<Elky> and then gandalf got frodo a ring cutie mark
<Samwise> I see a beautiful hobbit face with clear blue eyes
<lemonloaf> eagles
<Gandalf> 4Er, I mean, ha ha. You make me laugh, lad
<Purple`Prose> And then Gandalf went 'aw shit'
<Kenko> And this is Gandla'f "oh, Crap" moment...
<Crainy> NICE ONE RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> PHYSICS!
<Odin> 0"It says bitches be trippin"
<Legolas> 3*Ahem* Elvish.
<DSNesmith> Moooooordoooooooor
<Radagast> R.I.P. Elvish Presley
<Aragorn> 8>inb4 allegory for WWII
<Gimli> 11Bjornfot: Agreed 100%. But that's politics, and I don't feel like discussing it.
<Gandalf> 4Did I mention I'm fluent in Elvish?
<DSNesmith> >inb4 death of the author
<shadowLurker> it says if found, please return to sauron, lord of darkness
<Aragorn> 8>inb4 allegory for religion
<Combustiblelemons> all that on one ring?
<Dat_Pon-3> he made a poem aww
<Razyn> 0Wow us, Gandalf
<Starbuck> Did I say @Meanwhile? I meant @Tictac
<EspyLacopa> Ah, the language of Mordor.
<Odin> 0>inb4 an allegory for norman invasion
<Samwise> >yfw Tom Bombadil represents...the neutral party
*Ron_Weasley 10casts a spell to make him fluent in all languages
<Thetrollside> 0@bjornfot we entered because of the japanese and germans sinking our ships
<DSNesmith> Ash naghz zimbatul! or something
<lemonloaf> and now for my grade 3 show and tell class
<lemonloaf> i will recite a poem
<Gandalf> 4 4i se tipprova
<Azz> tome bombadil could walk into moridor
<Spazturtle> Nope
<Odin> 0>inb4 really open ended allegory
<Gimli> 11RANDOM ELVISH TRIVIA: The Elvish language lines spoken in the film are not just quotes from the book, they were derived from J.R.R. Tolkien's own limited dictionary of that language. Dialect coach Andrew Jack used actual recordings of Tolkien reading his books to guide the actors' pronunciation.
<Radagast> And yet Gandalf won't admit that Radagast exists.
<Bjornfot> Also, you killed a lot of innocent japs for no reason.
<EmmettBrown> It says Has anyone ever been as far as to go even to do look more like?
<Ron_Weasley> 10GANDALF OH SHIT HERE WE GO
<InsertCupcake> He exploded, then exploded again!
<DSNesmith> >inb4 not an allegory until overanalyzed
<Gandalf> 4No no
<Beat> Ron_Weasley is hax0rz
<Gandalf> 4I will not attempt to stall you all
<Legolas> 3Bjornfot, WW2 would have ended without the US, but then Europe would be Communist
<Gandalf> 4I have exposition to give, so watch the film
<Combustiblelemons> Sauron = Voldemort?
<Crainy> thats common knowledge, Gimli
<DSNesmith> oshi- politics
<EspyLacopa> A Ninja Sam has appeared!
<Ron_Weasley> 10legolas YFW Battle of Britain
<Legolas> 3But other than that, yeah
<lemonloaf> wouldnt it be easier
<PrincessCelestia> sauron= discord
<lemonloaf> to have like
<Samwise> What Azz speaks is true, even Tolkein said Tom could stop Sauron if he felt like it, but he didn't because he was a troll.
<Gimli> 11Still random trivia, isn't it?
<lemonloaf> a team of hobbits
<Shamu4Life> really quiet for anyone else?
<DSNesmith> We'll put it away!
<Starbuck> Voldemort?
<Thetrollside> 0bjornfo, they would have kept coming if we hadnt dropped the bombs
<CriticKitten> He rebuilt his castle. It didn't help that we forgot to station anyone in there to watch for these things, but that's besides the point. :D
<DSNesmith> in the same place that lost socks go
<lemonloaf> and its sort of like a relay race to mordor
<Thetrollside> 0bjornfot*
<lemonloaf> that way no one gets addicted to it
<Bjornfot> No Legolas. The world would have been better off without your... "interference". It's true for everything, even today.
<Gandalf> 4Well
<Odin> 0@gandalf gloriousexpositioncomrade.jpg
<Kenko> Which means Frodo wears the Dark Lord around his neck for three movies?
<Legolas> 3Ron_Weasley Oh I know, but defense doesn't invade normandy
<RobotPinkie> >implying Russian forces would have taken over all of Europe... lol
<Gandalf> 4Yeah, sorry for not telling you, Frodo. My bad?
<MirthTinker> yfw Tolkien actually considered making languages a hobby, and made Elven and many derivations with full vocabulary and grammar, enough to enable him to speak it
<EspyLacopa> Samwise really came into his own awesomeness during the later parts of the second movie and the third movie.
<Legolas> 3Bjornfot Well...after WWII...yeah we fucked up
<Elky> well, at least all of germany
<Ron_Weasley> 10Yeah but Britain wasn't lost. Mainland Europe was, and they're all rubbish anyway ;)
<Bjornfot> Don't come and say that eg Hiroshima did any good.
<DSNesmith> How astute, frodo
<Radagast> I can't evolve Graveler into Gollum.
<eeveesprit> meanwhile in new jearsey
<InsertCupcake> But thats where I live!
<Samwise> Breaking News: Hilter's zombie has sued Tolkein's zombie
<DSNesmith> TAKE IT
<Riders> Wait Luke
<Odin> 0Oh wait
<Meanwhile> I am not in New Jersey
<Elky> love you too rainbro
<Gandalf> 4I don't want it >: (

<Starbuck> "But that would lead them back... home!"
<Gimli> 11TEMPTATION!

<PinkiewithaBaskethat> Hello bronies

<DSNesmith> I want it
<InsertCupcake> FRodo has LEVERAGE!
<Dat_Pon-3> NOW ARE U OUT OF YOUR MIND FRODO THET'LL KILL ME GOOD LUCK THO
<Gandalf> 4I would like to remain single, Frodo
<EspyLacopa> Sucks to be Gollum.
<Radagast> It's not a cock ring, Gandalf. How is this tempting?
<Eowyn> 14lol Gandalf

<lemonloaf> and im going to crap myself arent i
<Kenko> Bravely Frodo ran away...
<InsertCupcake> Brit here too
<Legolas> 3Bjornfot, no hiroshima was horrible...but it also let the world know what nukes could do, making sure the cold war never became hot...
<Thetrollside> 0eventually it would be taken like the rest of Europe
<RobotPinkie> .m
<Bjornfot> No Thetrollside, USA did almost nothing compared to every other country. They did like, 20% of nazi casualties.

<Aragorn> 8HE DRIVES ME TO SMOKE PIPEWEED
<Bjornfot> SPOILER: It's because you are horrible-
<Madadude> sex slave
<Samwise> 1. Forced into certain death adventure
<Gandalf> 4Unfortunately, Peter Jackson didn't like my "better use" so we went with his
<Samwise> 2. Become best character
<Ron_Weasley> 10xD
<PinkiewithaBaskethat> :D is m face when I pony
<Samwise> 3. ???
<mib_fn933m> giggidy
<Samwise> 4. Profit
<Kenko> Oddly, Gandalf's best decision ever...
<Legolas> 3But wouldn't you rather have both the US and USSR know what nuclear weapons could actually do?
<EspyLacopa> yup. Samwise saves the world.
<Radagast> It's funny because Sir Ian is gay.
<lemonloaf> gandalf is a mary sue
<Bjornfot> Yes, ARE. You had nothing to do in the middle-east either. Bush only went in there for the oil.
<EspyLacopa> Best, Sidekick, Ever.
<MirthTinker> 5. Endure implied homosexualism for eternity
<Legolas> 3Bjornfot I don't doubt that.
<DSNesmith> lol@politics flamewar
<lemonloaf> bodyguards are too mainstream
<RobotPinkie> It's gay because Sir Ian is fun.
<Rezo> By 'Sidekick', you of course mean 'Lover'
<lemonloaf> im taking my gardener
<Odin> 0This movie is a lot more homoerotic than I remember...
<Crainy> no its not
<Ron_Weasley> 10lol odin
<Gandalf> 4mfw There are two conversations taking place in the chat
<Thetrollside> 0@bjornfot, bush was a retard but atleast not as bad as obama
<Crainy> its your dirty pony minds
<Meanwhile> brokeback mount doom
<shadowLurker> it's dangerous to go alone, take your gardener
<DSNesmith> inb4 incredulous Ho-Yay scene
<RobotPinkie> Enjoying it a lot, Odin?
<Crainy> wait
<Samwise> Srsly guys, this is manly shit
<CriticKitten> What, you counted, Sam?
<Madadude> push him
<Gandalf> 4@Odin: You haven't seen homoerotic until the third film
<Crainy> he remembers his EXACT step?!
<Aragorn> 8<Odin>: This movie is a lot more homoerotic than I remember...
<Kenko> It's really just that those two look like they should be-- but they aren't.
<desertman2> Why does everybody insists on seeing sex everywhere?
<Odin> 0I know
<Aragorn> 8i lol'd
<Radagast> homosex exists because of Sir Ian. He's like Dracula.
<Legolas> 3Bjornfot I think we never should have gone into either
<Gimli> 11RANDOM CORNFIELD TRIVIA: On the film's first theatrical release, a story circulated (and was reported in the goofs section) that when Sam tells Frodo that he is now the farthest he has ever been from home, a car is visible driving by in the background (top-right corner of the screen). Arguments ensued. Some said it was smoke from a chimney
<Gimli> 11thers said they saw the glint of sunlight reflected from the windscreen of a fast-moving vehicle. In the version of the film released on DVD there is definitely no car, only chimney smoke and a one-frame flash of light that could conceivably be a car, but not in any sense that could be considered a goof.
<lemonloaf> lol, he saw the line he drew around the shire
<Ersatz> To be fair, there is a scarecrow
<Bjornfot> Both democratics and republicans are retards, thetrollside. Has USA ever heard of Libertarianism?
<DSNesmith> Suddenly Ian Holm voiceover
<eeveesprit> LOOK OUT , THERE ARE POKEMON IN THE TALL GRASS
<Shad> Ponies are about 20% manlier than LOTR
<lemonloaf> DONT GO PAST THIS lINE OR Ill BE OUT OF THE SHIRE
<Legolas> 3Bjornfot But to say we should have known is hindsight blindness
<EmmettBrown> This is starting to sound like one of those dumbass arguments they have on /b/ over which country is the best.
<Starbuck> It sounded like he said "Remember what dildo used to say!"
<Ersatz> "It's dangerous business going out your door". I need to read that fic.
<Radagast> Is it still clever to say Dildo instead of Bilbo?
<Galadriel> 7EQD hates us?
<DragonRage> Equestria is the best country, obviously.
<Gandalf> 4Celine Dion is among them
<DSNesmith> "Let's go take nekkid pictures and put them on the hobbitnet!"
<Samwise> not really
<Crainy> SUDDENLY
<Crainy> ELVES
<Samwise> hobbitchan
<Aragorn> 8confound this sethisto
<Dermathil> >yfw Celine Dion is french canadian
<Purple`Prose> FORESHADOWING
<Ron_Weasley> 10we've got 119 without EqD?
<Legolas> 3*Ahem* Elves are definitely awesome.
<Ron_Weasley> 10Fucking win
<eeveesprit> america>germaany
<Elky> Ersatz: do yourself a favor and read it, then ignore the last three of four chapters
<Lantar> Well Europeans allowed Hitler to do what he f*cking wants because the were afraid of the new world war and thus digged own grave.
<Kenko> Elves look more like ghosts...
<CHAENNE> mom keeps calling him dildo cause she thinks its funny and origional
<DSNesmith> you can tell they're elves because they naturally emit bloom
<mib_fn933m> Douche baggins.
<InsertCupcake> Thats no root
<Crainy> thats because the ELVES are in sad mode right now
<lemonloaf> oh my god
<Crainy> then they look like ghosts
<RobotPinkie> induring random nationalism
<Samwise> Sam, that was very gay
<RanYakumo> Have Merry and Pippin come in yet?
<lemonloaf> look at that bloom effect
<Dermathil> nope
<DSNesmith> I see WHY they cut these scenes from the theatrical cut
<Bjornfot> You could have tested it on something better than a HUGE CITY FULL OF PEOPLE
<Starbuck> "Dirty gray root." Is that what Gandalf calls it?
<eeveesprit> but hitler gave us free cars lol
<lemonloaf> thats so realistic
<Rezo> Elves are tall, blonde, blue eyed whites. Oh Tolkien
<Gandalf> 4Still no post?
<lemonloaf> they should work for infinity ward
<Aragorn> 8nope
<Radagast> Elves are self-righteous putzes
<Elky> blonde?
<Legolas> 3Bjornfot like what?
<Elky> eeeenope
<CriticKitten> Can't imagine why this critical scene about Sam's inability to get to sleep wasn't kept in the original cut.
<Pegacorn> @Bjornfot,stop hatin' on the US.It only makes them angry.
<Gandalf> 4I do believe Starbuck made a joke
<Aragorn> 8i emailed him about 15 minutes ago
<DSNesmith> dat nightmare
<RanYakumo> DAT HORSE
<Shad> Roses are gray, Gandalf is too, But then he's white, and i'm confused
<Dermathil> >yfw Tolkien wrote the books before Nazis came along
<Meanwhile> Elves are like vulcans with more rage.
<Ersatz> Bjornfot is a mmmmbitch who likes bananas?
<Gandalf> 4Faster, Big Macintosh!
<Elky> elves eat their own dead
<Starbuck> Yes, Gandalf. And it was hilarious.
<Rezo> in b4 BEST WIZARD
<Radagast> even their horses are evil.
<Pegacorn> BANANAS
<Crainy> SARUMAN
<eeveesprit> send him to the moon
<Samwise> inb4 the adventure becomes so extreme the yreplace pillows with rocks because they feel more comfy
<Crainy> your voice is awesome
<Riders> Dat score
<RobotPinkie> >yfw This is fantasy
<RanYakumo> You can tell just by the design of that tower that it's evil.
<DragonRage> To Isengard?
<Meanwhile> That's a very evil looking tower
<Legolas> 3Pegacorn I am not angry man. I love participating in a good debate.
<Thetrollside> 0bjornfot: ok lets say we didnt drop the bombs on the japs and they kept comming....
<DSNesmith> The grrrrrreat and poweeeerrrrrful Saruman
<Bjornfot> I'm not hating on US citizens, or even the country itself. I'm hating on their leaders, mostly.
<Purple`Prose> Hi Ian!
<lemonloaf> ive been spending too much time on the internet
<RanYakumo> NO, IT"S CAPTAIN PLANET
<Gimli> 11RANDOM SARUMAN TRIVIA: While Christopher Lee was always Peter Jackson's first choice for the role of Saruman. Jackson did consider Tim Curry, Jeremy Irons and Malcolm McDowell for the role.
<Gandalf> 4I admit, he's currently higher level than I
<Thetrollside> 0comeing*
<Radagast> Aizen guard
<lemonloaf> i expected him to say "smoke weed erryday"
<Thetrollside> 0coming
<Thetrollside> 0w/e
<Gandalf> 4I am not pleased by that, of course
<Meanwhile> Tim Curry would be terrifying
<DSNesmith> Jeremy Irons would have been hilarious, but the funny would ruin the movie
<Gimli> 11> Tim Curry
<Amorphic> count douku
<Starbuck> Saruman. It's like a stereotypical Asian saying "Slenderman."
<Gandalf> 4He doesn't know that I urinate in his drink
<Gimli> 11He would fucking scare me
<Aponymous> Tim Curry as Saruman?
<Radagast> Sean Connery should have been Gandalf
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, I gladly hate on the US media.
<Aragorn> 8>you get high too much gandalf
<Aponymous> :D
<Saruman> 13You're just mad that I'm better than you Gandalf
<RanYakumo> Rob Zombie would totally make a great Lords of the Rings remake.
<lemonloaf> wait
<Dermathil> suddenly me is someone
<Samwise> I drank 3 cups of coffee and it's 1:47AM, but i'm starting to feel a bit hazy and the film technically hasn't started yet. :/
<Bjornfot> thetrollside: then kill every single retard who comes to you. BUT DON'T EVER TOUCH CIVILIANS
<RainbowLoon> Saru'n'Furter
<lemonloaf> if they're wizards
<Gandalf> 4What is going on?
<lemonloaf> where are their hats
<Elky> if I was a wizard, building a huge tower to compensate would be exactly what I'd do
<RobotPinkie> GLADLY!
<DragonRage> Likewise, Elky.
<DSNesmith> No EQD hit yet?
<Gandalf> 4Saruman?!
<Samwise> ^Already posted
<RobotPinkie> Well, anything you can do, Gandalf can do better
<lemonloaf> id build a huge tower
<DragonRage> Hell, just building huge towers in general is what I'd do.
<Gandalf> 4We do not have much time!
<Saruman> 13Gandalf.
<Starbuck> EXTREME CLOSE-UPS

<Aponymous> RanYakumo: lolno

<CriticKitten> Sauron is Big Brother
<lemonloaf> learn an anti gravity spell
<DragonRage> I would litter the landscape with pointlessly huge towers.
<DSNesmith> an army of fanboys
<lemonloaf> and just jump off it daily
<Elky> has there ever been a lotr musical?
<Legolas> 3Bjornfot If we hadn't known just how horrible of destruction a nuke could cause to a city, would the US or USSR hesitate to use one?
<Aragorn> 8i dunno
<EmmettBrown> Do you have to write the date more than 6 times a day?
<Starbuck> LEVERAGE!
<Saruman> 13No we don't!
<Odin> 0CHRISTOPHER LEE VS. SEAN CONNERY GO
<eeveesprit> RanYakumo, chen was here
<Combustiblelemons> A SPHERE
<EspyLacopa> I remember how in the books, Saruman started wearing a robe with all the colors in the rainbow, signifying how he wasn't Saruman the White anymore.
<Gandalf> 4But why, Saruman, why use his tool?
<lemonloaf> imagine peoples faces when they see me jumping off my huge tower
<Samwise> Christopher Lee
<mib_7u6e2q> Nerds . . .
<Radagast> Once Ron Paul gets elected, I'm building a pointlessly high tower.
<Gimli> 11RANDOM CHRISTOPHER LEE TRIVIA: Christopher Lee reads "The Lord of the Rings" once a year and has done so since the year it was published, and is the only member of the cast and crew ever to have met J.R.R. Tolkien.
<lemonloaf> just to float safely to the bottom
<Bjornfot> Legolas, neither would probably have cared.
<RanYakumo> eeveesprit That silly girl! Where has she gotten off to now?

<sotha> Get the point?
<eeveesprit> RanYakumo, she went drinking with suika
<Samwise> Lee's such a nerd
<Gimli> 11RANDOM CHRISTOPHER LEE TRIVIA: As well as being the only member of the cast and crew to have met J.R.R. Tolkien face to face, Christopher Lee was also the first person to be cast in the trilogy because of his extensive knowledge of the books. He frequently visited the makeup department and often gave tips about the facial design of the monsters.
<Aponymous> Gimli: Wow, that is awesome
<Elky> he could read new, possible better books
<Aragorn> 8>inb4 gilda saves gandalf

<PrincessCelestia> inb4 awsome fight
<DSNesmith> Gandalf, you fool! No one who rolls their 'r's that hard can be a good guy!
<Legolas> 3Bjornfot And how would that turn out...I am thinking fallout 1-3 style
<Bjornfot> Your point being, Legolas?
<lemonloaf> uh, if you're a wizard, can't you just teleport yourself out of the tower
<Saruman> 13Bwahahaha.
<Pegacorn> BANANAS

<EspyLacopa> Ah, two old guys beating the crap out of each other.
<Gimli> 11inb4 Gandalf Did I Mention is a meme
<Legolas> 3Bjornfot If we hadn't used the nuke in war and learned its true devastation, then the US or USSR might have used one against the other(Because neither would have known the power of one) and the world would enter WWIII
<Pegacorn> OHNO NYX IS HERE
<Riders> Dat Green Screen effect
<eeveesprit> he became gandalf the hite now right?
<Crainy> WE NEED MORE BALROG
<Meanwhile> In a corn field?
<eeveesprit> white*
<RanYakumo> Fun fact: In the theatrical version of this scene, you could see a car passing behind in the background.
<Radagast> Hi, Nyx
<CriticKitten> Whoopsie, silly browser.
<Samwise> Nyx loves Harry Potter... >:(
<EspyLacopa> He doesn't become Gandalf the White until he defeats the Balrog.
<Crainy> LOL
<Odin> 0SUDDENLY
<Crainy> LOL
<lemonloaf> sam and frodo stop to play in a corn maze
<Gandalf> 4@Gimli: It just may, my dear dwarf
<Crainy> LOL

<Nyx> Hello
<Kenko> Hello. Ebter the stupid.
<Odin> 0COUSIN ATTACK

<RanYakumo> Gimli Mmkay.
<Legolas> 3Bjornfot Of course, I do not think that killing civilians was warranted
<eeveesprit> SECRET BUT FUN
<Dat_Pon-3> cars existed in middle earth?
<Meanwhile> Dat scythe
<lemonloaf> merry and pippin cheat
<bigmacsweene> what'd i miss fellas?
<Bjornfot> Legolas: The US and USSR bombing each other to pieces would have ben good for the rest of the world.
<eeveesprit> who let the doggs out?
<Crainy> not really...
<Radagast> Cars exist in New Zealand?
<Purple`Prose> COMEDY!
<Starbuck> This is the part where they meet the Scarecrow. If he only had a brain.
<Meanwhile> slapstick
<EmmettBrown> GERROUT 'O' MOI FIELD
<Nyx> These guys suck
<Samwise> IMHO: first three Harry Potter movies = God Tier, rest of movies = meh, books = even more meh
<Kenko> If only THEY had brains.
<lemonloaf> Bjornfot: so a bunch of innocent people who dont give a crap about it get killed?
<RobotPinkie> Hobbitroll'd
<Legolas> 3Bjornfot Uh...you forget about the real killer of nuclear war: The radioactive fallout particles
<Riders> Sam is a little bit slow, isn't he?
<Crainy> actually
<lemonloaf> yeah that sounds fantastic
<Madadude> my carrot!
<Bjornfot> No radagast, it was actually a sheep.
<DSNesmith> I liked HP 3 the best myself
<Shad> he broke his carrot -gasp-
<Crainy> i liked the 6 Harry Potter movie the most
<DSNesmith> Alfonso Cuaron is a genius
<Rezo> Could that fucking INTERNET WANNABE HISTORIANS BULLSHIT ABOUT WORLD FUCKING BRAWL TWO AND A HALF STOP?
<Meanwhile> Shortcut to PAIN
<Ersatz> I was under the impression that they didn't actually have to change anything to film this in New Zealand.
<Crainy> like the 6th one
<Samwise> he broke his dorty white root
<CriticKitten> Shrooms. :o
<Eowyn> 14Shrooms!
<Madadude> SHROOOOOOOOOOMS
<RanYakumo> MUSHROOM SHORTCUTS ARE THE BEST SHORTCUTS.
<lemonloaf> oh man
<lemonloaf> shrooms
<shadowLurker> mushrooooooms...
<Radagast> I'm glad that carrot isn't a metaphor for anything.
<Nyx> The fourth Harry Potter movie was best
<eeveesprit> harry potter 2 was awesome
<Nyx> Better than the book
<Elky> the books are good for what they do
<Shad> I read the harry potter books but saw no movies
<RainbowLoon> BADGER BADGER BADGER
<Elky> but the hp movies... bah.
<mib_fn933m> shrooms...
<Shad> I feel like such a twilight
<EmmettBrown> I agree i=with Rezo
<DSNesmith> Nyx o you
<Riders> SNAKE
<eeveesprit> 1 to 4 was best, the rest was meh
<Meanwhile> Ominous wailing
<Crainy> i think they were all pretty meh
<DragonRage> I think I only saw the first four HP movies. =/
<Crainy> but 6 was fun as hell
<Kenko> When the path swells, bad things happen.
<RanYakumo> It's Twilight Sparkle, run and hide!
<Gimli> 11RANDOM RING WRAITH TRIVIA: 29 Ring Wraith costumes were made in total.
<Samwise> 1 was best
<mib_fn933m> MUSHROOM MUSCHROOM!
<Elky> what dragonrage said
<eeveesprit> 6 was kind of boring
<Crainy> btw
<Rodman> Gimil: Wasn't Sean Connery at one point considered for Gandalf?
<Legolas> 3Rezo, your right Bjornfot, we can continue to debate in PM
<Samwise> this is why tree is Tom bombadil
<Radagast> inb4 fandom creates a Nyx version of Discord.
<DSNesmith> "Poooooniiiiieeeeeeees.... Bagginnsssssssssss...."
<bigmacsweene> PONIES!
<Nyx> Now we know!

<Dat_Pon-3> y do i have a feelin hes fkn with them
<DragonRage> Meanie*
<Elky> sean connery as gandalf?
<eeveesprit> IT'S NIGHTMARE MOON
<CriticKitten> And hey, didn't say the Harry Potter duels were BAD. I just like Saruman and Gandalf's duel way more. Bitches knock each other with telekinesis. I wish I could do that. :(
<Crainy> the best scene in all of the Harry Potter movies, without competition, is the story of the deathly hallows in 7
<Combustiblelemons> death?
<RanYakumo> Why hello there post-Cupcakes Pinkie Pie.
<Starbuck> Death eaters?
<Nyx> Discord is revived as an aliconr filly
<Odin> 0WHATSSSSSSSSSS GOIN ON
<Radagast> Sean Connery as Gandalf
<Rezo> I'd like being a ringwraith
<Eowyn> 14He came
<Elky> his chest hair would defeat sauron in the first scene...
<Samwise> Peter jackson bugs scene: Oh You
<Nyx> Thus Nyx is born, and suddenly everyone hates wachother
<DSNesmith> Nazgul gave up "Seeing hobbits in front of you" in order to take the "Glowing horse eyes" feat
<lemonloaf> i actually tried reading these books, i couldnt because i have a terrible attention span and reading several hundred pages of "they walked a lot and complained about food" isn't really interesting to me
<Dat_Pon-3> i just came
<Totalwar57> dks are so overpowered
<Meanwhile> White wizard shtanding by
<RobotPinkie> Frodo...... don't wear the ring
<Elky> I don't see how this'd work
<DSNesmith> MUSHROOMSSSSSS
<DragonRage> He can sense the dramatic tension!
<RanYakumo> Rezo Yeah, besides the whole "forsaking your soul" part, it'd be pretty cool.
<Rezo> I can live with that
<DragonRage> My Gods, that would be a useful power to have in real life.
<Sumica> that sounded like a distraction, I better go check it out
<DSNesmith> "Whatever it was, it was pretty stupid."
<Samwise> Tree was Tom Bombadil, but who was fone?
<Meanwhile> fone was cherry picker guy
<CHAENNE> wow
<Pegacorn> Nyx isn't afraid of the dark.Or it's GODDAMN ANNOYING PIECE OF SHIT TRAILERS THAT KEEP INTERRUPTING MY VIEWINGS OF FAMILY GUY BETWEEN SCENES!
<Radagast> Peter Jackson made this, then where are the T-Rexs and giant gorilla?
<lemonloaf> id stab people in the ass so they grab their ass in pain every time im near them
<Maxaminus> Fuck Tom Bombadil
<DSNesmith> lol pegacorn
<lemonloaf> and then laugh at them being butthurt
<Maxaminus> he ruined the books
<Samwise> Radagast: they're not until two Towers
<DSNesmith> tom bombadil is the chapter I always skip
<EmmettBrown> I'm tired,I'm going to watch the ending of the top gear video I've got on the other tab and then bed
<eeveesprit> GET DOWN WITH FRODO
<Rodman> Goddamn, that guy needs some glasses!
<Meanwhile> Gotta get down with frodo
<DSNesmith> "Together..."
<RanYakumo> EmmettBrown Top Gear FTW.
<Samwise> The Big Lipped Aligator Moment
<Crainy> RANDOM PETER JACKSON TRIVIA: He actually was in Pre-Production for King Kong BEFORE he made LOTR, but his original King Kong movie, called "KONG", got cancelled, then he did LOTR
<desertman2> Haven't they already left?
<Odin> 0Good night emmett
<CHAENNE> too scary, gonna go watch pnies.
<Sumica> Inception horn!
<Gimli> 11RANDOM FERRY TRIVIA: In one take of the Bucklebury Ferry scene, Elijah Wood overshot his jump and ended up in the river instead of on the Ferry.
<Azz> tom bombadil could duplicate the ring and give it to everyone
<Shad> well technically
<DSNesmith> King Kong is the better movie, soely because it has Adrien Brody
<Meanwhile> lmao
<Shad> this is a pony
<Dermathil> lawl Gimli
<Shad> its just a scary ass pony
<Crainy> nah
<PrincessCelestia> to the boat!
<Kenko> Bombadil was a character that JRRT had made for the world-myth, and later added to the book to show that somethings were just plain not explicable.
<Ersatz> Is that a win or a fail?
<DSNesmith> King Kong's biggest problem though was that it was SO GODDAMN LONG
<Crainy> King Kong is just an "ok" movie
<RanYakumo> GET TO THE BOOOAATT
<Samwise> DSN: not soley, it's awesome for lots of reasons
<Radagast> But it also has Jack Black
<Rodman> Its one of the ponies from Sunny Town
<Crainy> Adrien Brody is awesome, though
<Sumica> get to the choppa!
<RobotPinkie> King Kong 2: Brodyquest
<lemonloaf> adrien brody adrien brody adrien brody adrien brody
<Shad> I'M ON A BOAT
<Meanwhile> Run you spazz
<RanYakumo> QUICK TIME EVENT UPCOMING
<Aponymous> King Kong was bad.
<Pegacorn> BTW,if my all caps rage wasn't a big enough clue,i think Don't be afraid of the dark is the most annoying movie of 2011.
<durger> i always get peter jackson confused with sam raimi. idk why
<Crainy> The LOTR movies are some of the very best
<eeveesprit> movies with chuck norris in ti where legendary
<Crainy> EVER
<CriticKitten> So, would the Nazgul's horses be the Shadowbolts then?
<EmmettBrown> Lord of the rings is "Ambitious,but rubbish
<DSNesmith> I really liked KK, but the first HOUR is mostly filler
<Rezo> I remember the butthurt among the tolkien taliban when tom bombadil wasn't in the film
<desertman2> Can't they just swim?
<Crainy> btw, Adrien Brody is my favorite actor
<Meanwhile> Ringwraiths can't cross water
<Gimli> 11RANDOM FERRY TRIVIA: During one take of the Buckleberry Ferry scene, a very strong splinter found its way through Dominic Monaghan's prosthetic foot and into his own causing him considerable pain. While crew members took the splinter out of his foot, Monaghan bragged to his fellow hobbits as to how large the splinter would be,
<Gimli> 11 but it ended up being very small. From that point on Billy Boyd would tease him about splinters whenever something happened to Dominic, much to Dominic's frustration.
<Radagast> King Kong was pedantic.
<Sumica> they cant cross water
<Rodman> STAY BACK SUNNY TOWN PONY! STAND BACK!
<Dat_Pon-3> was long typical peter jackson
<Combustiblelemons> "I knew I should have brought the crossbow"
<Gandalf> 4If this were a Sam Raimi film, Bruce Campbell would make an appearance and there'd be a chainsaw somewhere
<Pegacorn> Freakin' Guillermo del Toro keeps making me flip my shit.
<Radagast> >Bucklberry Ferry
<PrincessCelestia> pony?

<Meanwhile> obbits
<Rezo> Ponies in middle earth!
<Dat_Pon-3> we should watch Evil Dead
<DSNesmith> gimli, the best trivia about these movies has got to be that scene in TT with aragorn and the helmet
<Rezo> I knew it
<Turtaguin> DID FRODO JUST SAY PONY?!?!
<Samwise> Length is overrated. If movie critics can seriously give a movie a bad review because it was long, then that goes to show you how awful the critics of our generation are.
<lemonloaf> FRODO'S A BRONY
<durger> and dirtbike camera shots abound
<RainbowLoon> he did
<DSNesmith> Samwise, there's a difference between long movie
<Gimli> 11They should have gotten Michael Bay to direct. *trollface*
<Rezo> >implying critics were ever good
<Dermathil> Dat_Pon-3 we already watched the 2nd and 3rd
<DSNesmith> and endless filler
<Rodman> We should watch Evil Dead 2 or ARMY OF DARKNESS!
<Crainy> HEY
<Starbuck> On the note of King Kong: SKUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUL! SKULL! IT SAYS SKULL!
<Crainy> dont mob Michael Bay
<Ersatz> Suddenly there was a massive explosion!
<Crainy> hes an awesome director
<Rezo> You should read the initial critics for films like, say, the Terminator. It's laughable.
<DragonRage> My Little Hobbits: Fellowship is Magic?
<Rodman> Dermathil Awwww, really?
<Galadriel> 7already did
<Gandalf> 4@Rodman: We already did

<Riders> Not necessarrily. Ever watch Drag Me To Hell? All the Evil Dead goofiness without Ash.
<Crainy> but Michael Bay wouldnt want to direct LOTR, anyways
<Elky> we should watch the room
<RanYakumo> Meanwhile Probably the Shire.
<PrincessCelestia> I heard theres a hot furry girl in space jam
<Rezo> Ebert absolutely hated Once Upon a Time in the West when it was released. So yeah.
<Rezo> My point stands
<eeveesprit> Ponymensch YOU ARE GERMAN?
<Crainy> Roger Ebert is a windbag
<Aponymous> >mfw people recommending movies we already watched.

<Odin> 0Dat accent
<Ponymensch> eeveesprit nope
<Bjornfot> oh look DSNesmith
<Radagast> Lola Bunny is hotter in that new Looney Tunes cartoon
<Elky> Apon: we should watch superman IV
<Samwise> Riders: I love that movie, but it never felt like an Evil Dead movie like everyone says.
<eeveesprit> Ponymensch good
<DSNesmith> oh hai bjornfot
<bigmacsweene> he's busy playing magicka
<Gimli> 11RANDOM CAMEO TRIVIA: Peter Jackson: As the belching peasant, outside the Prancing Pony Inn in Bree.
<Meanwhile> The ringwraith horses would've had flame decals
<Rezo> Elky: Die.
<Crainy> Evil Dead was fucking scary....
<DragonRage> Damn it, Gh-Gandalf, why'd you have to say that?
<CriticKitten> Stay there and drink obviously.
<sotha> Drink and be Merry!
<RanYakumo> I want that ferret.
<Pegacorn> Michael Bay ruins anything and errything he touches.
<DragonRage> I miss that game.
<Dermathil> Elky, don'tcha remember? First movie the movie nights ever streamed!
<Crainy> not true
<Gandalf> 4Yeah, sorry about that Frodo. I was in a dancing contest with Saruman and we decided to do SUDDEN DEATH
<Ersatz> Maybe I need a more generic german word for a name. People only rarely ask me about it.
<bigmacsweene> evil dead was mind f**k
<Crainy> Michael Bay is a good director
<Samwise> I love Jackson's cameo in Two Towers
<Meanwhile> a point
<desertman2> I need to continue that game
<Odin> 0The barkeep sounds like my grandfather, kinda
<Nittany_Tiger_> My cat!
<RanYakumo> EVERYTHING IS BETTER IN PINTS
<Crainy> however, some of his script writers suck...
<Pegacorn> Michael Bay sucks.
<Radagast> We should watch The Rock so I can laugh when everyone likes the movie.
<eeveesprit> OMG OFFICIAL ST
<Nittany_Tiger_> Actually, my cat has short hair.
<RobotPinkie> >The game
<Gimli> 11RANDOM PERSPECTIVE TRIVIA: Some of the customers in the Prancing Pony are walking around on stilts to emphasize the height disparity with the Hobbits.
<DSNesmith> this place looks like east cleveland
<Crainy> Michael Bay rocks
<Aponymous> We SHOULD watch Dead Alive, Peter Jackson's best movie.
<Elky> ... hard to judge whether counter sarcasm
<CriticKitten> Corner stalker.
<Gandalf> 4Yes, point at the guy who's been staring at you
<Amorphic> Dat EqD completely forgetting about us
<Ponymensch> eeveesprit What do you mean good? I come from German/Austrian/English/Scotch Descent!
<Meanwhile> dem stilts.
<Gandalf> 4Not stupid at all
<Riders> Gandalf = Why KotOR, specifically?
<Crainy> Michael Bay is one of the best directors out there
<Nittany_Tiger_> Rangers be rangin'.
<Darken_Skye> I want a Cute Ferret
<Rodman> Ranger
<Sumica> STRIDERS!
<lemonloaf> rangers gonna range
*DragonRage starts playing Shadow's theme from FF6.
<Gandalf> 4Strider Hiryu?
<Meanwhile> Michael Bay is a dipshit.
<DSNesmith> It always bugged me that Sam calls him Strider for the entire series
<bigmacsweene> clearly ezio
<Elky> crainy: oh you
<Rodman> But we all know he multi-classes
<RanYakumo> Pegacorn The Rock was alright. Other than that...
<Samwise> prince-dari: Why petition? Hasbro already knows we want a soundtrack, they just don't have the rights sorted out.
<Radagast> Michael Bay is awesome
<Crainy> OH YEAH
<durger> i wanna play Skyrim right now so badly
<Gandalf> 4I dunno, Riders. Probably because people were talking about it earlier
<DSNesmith> durger why
<DSNesmith> WHY
<Combustiblelemons> rangers? i wonder if there's one called hunter or khan
<RobotPinkie> So next weekend, Transformers trilogy?
<Crainy> BLAST YOUR ASS OFF, ASSHOLES

<Ponymensch> eeveesprit Well that's okay. My grandfather fought in WWII. My german descent is pre-WWII
<RainbowLoon> ceiling Sauron is seeing you clop
<Aponymous> Michael Bay owned Uwe Boll, he's cool in my book.
<DSNesmith> Meester Baggins!
<Kenko> And we thought Nightmare Moon's eyes were disturbing.
<deliopen> Did it start early?
<Riders> Michael Bay movies aren't good but they are fun. Except for Transformers
<TwilightSparkleFTW> LotR
<DSNesmith> Indeed.
<Gandalf> 4Well, we are all the primary protagonists
<TwilightSparkleFTW> let's do this
<CriticKitten> The characters in this movie laugh at your silly classes
<ImperialMitre> watched this movie so many times
<Gandalf> 4So we're exceptional
<Crainy> lawl
<Radagast> Michael Bay is what Adrien Brody will look like in 15 years.
<DSNesmith> damn Viggo's the man
<RobotPinkie> Yeah right, Viggo being unnoticed...
<Crainy> good suggestion
<CriticKitten> Clearly. :D
<RanYakumo> Fists versus sword.
<Meanwhile> Longshanks!
<Dat_Pon-3> frodo "im horny" sauron: dont you think about you hairy lil freak
<DSNesmith> I wish I knew other good movies he's in
<Starbuck> Someone at school said Transformers 3 is one of the best movies he's ever seen.
<DSNesmith> because all the ones I've seen him in were terrible
<RanYakumo> TIME TO KILL OFF ANOTHER TOKEN CHARACTER
<Starbuck> I hate my generation.
<Odin> 0Candelabra ftw
<TwilightSparkleFTW> I haven't seen this in a while
<Crainy> i loved Transformers 3
<Gimli> 11RANDOM ACTOR TRIVIA: Peter Jackson's first two choices for the role of Aragorn were Daniel Day-Lewis and 'Russell Crowe (I)'. Crowe was excited about the prospect of being involved with a major motion picture in New Zealand, but couldn't commit due to scheduling conflicts in America.
<Bjornfot> splat
<Ponymensch> lol owned
<Samwise> Michael Bay films were always stupid...until he started tackling adaptations.
<Crainy> it was an experience
<DSNesmith> Hidalgo, bluuuugh
<Ersatz> That was a crappy door.
<Samwise> So much lag
<derpmuffin> dramatic time!
<CriticKitten> @Starbuck: Did you ask if he was trlling? xD

<Crainy> DEAD
<Rezo> stabstabtsabtsabstab

<Odin> 0gandalf: problem?
<RanYakumo> Russell Crowe is a good actor, but he isn't right for the role.
<Dat_Pon-3> movie over!
<Samwise> Honestly, Platinum Dunes pisses me off far more than Transformers.
<DSNesmith> The End, Goooodnight everybody
<Combustiblelemons> overkill much?
<Starbuck> CriticKitten, I did. Many times. He said I had no taste in movies.
<Radagast> Transformers 3 left me confused instead off pissed like I was in Transform 2. IMPROVEMENT

<Madadude> >.>
<Samwise> pile of dog shit > Transformers 2 > Transformers 3
<mobileDCD> Nick Vujicic is coming to Panama for a speech the 31st
<RanYakumo> That Skree is the Ring Wraith equivalent of "FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU"
<Crainy> its Michael Bays masterpiece
<Meanwhile> Happy to bring about the giggles Boromir.
<Radagast> Sauron the Deceiver? How many titles does Sauron have?
<Madadude> Agreed Samwise
<mobileDCD> that's the bro from The Butterfly Circus btw
<Ponymensch> Where's Hipster? Or who?
<Odin> 0I didn't know whether we would have to deal with this through fisticuffs, gandalf
<Rezo> ring wraiths sound rather like shadow ships
<CriticKitten> Well we didn't find him in that one room, so let's not search the rest of the town
<DSNesmith> mobileDCD who?
<Rodman> Nazgul: Neither living nor dead.
<Crainy> Transformers 2 isnt better than 3
<Samwise> Crainy: no problem, I liked the first one in a guilty pleasure way
<Rodman> So they're Liches?
<RobotPinkie> Everyone's being a hipster right now, really. Take your pick. :P
<Pegacorn> lol Samwise,but 2 is the worst
<Nittany_Tiger_> Sauron the sexy?
<Crainy> ofc its no problem
<RanYakumo> Rodman You could say that.
<Elky> transformers 3 was the worst movie I ever watchedin cinema, and possibly of all time
<Ponymensch> Hipster_Brony
<Crainy> its my opinion, asshole
<Radagast> Nazgul = Michael Jackson
<Gandalf> 4Odin, my boy, a wizard does not dare fight with his fists. He fights with his will
<DSNesmith> Elky, you haven't seen Wicker Man?
<Kenko> Great. they can detect the RIng. Nazgul have their own Pinkie Sense.
<Ersatz> The GREAT and POWERFUL Sauron
<Starbuck> Can I have a link to Butterfly Circus? I only got to see the end.
<Crainy> well Elky, then you dont know shit about movies

<Meanwhile> He's taking the hobbits to rivendell
<Crainy> New Zealand
<mobileDCD> Nick Vujicic = The protagonist from The Butterfly Circus
<DSNesmith> because Nicholas Cage is the greatest ham of our time
<Samwise> 2 is nothing but shit, but I hate 3 more because it offered some stuff I liked and i still ended up hating it
<Odin> 0Which is why you don't see many fucking wizards, do you Gandalf?
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> sweet lotr time
<Starbuck> Birdemic, the Room, and Manos are the worst movies I've ever seen.
<Elky> but it has nick cage in it, so... ugh.
<Gimli> 11Gentlemen

<Gimli> 11RANDOM BREAKFAST TRIVIA: When Pippin is being hit with the apples after asking about second breakfast, it is Viggo Mortensen himself chucking the apple at his head. They had to shoot the scene 16 times to get it just right, and Billy Boyd says he believes Mortensen enjoyed himself immensely.
<DSNesmith> okay, Birdemic is pretty unstoppably bad

<Dermathil> (OH RIGHT, That joke. I had a cousin who at one point followed their eating habits)
<lemonloaf> how the hell do hobbits get anything done
<DSNesmith> original Wicker man had christopher lee and naked chicks
<Crainy> all you guys that bring up Michael Bay everywhere are stupid
<Riders> Samwise = Who cares which one is better. They're all shit
<lemonloaf> they're always stuffing their faces
<Samwise> Audience thinks it's a joke, LotR fans think it's a reference
<DSNesmith> new one has nic cage losing his shit and bees
<Meanwhile> Stoopid fat hobbit
<quill> ( reading the hobit was such a pain in the ass.... every five seconds.... I WANT TO GO HOME , SHUT UP!!!!
<RobotPinkie> dem flies
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> what if michael bay my lord of the rings?
<shadowLurker> lemonloaf they don't
<gecomol> spoiler horse sink into the lake of despair
<Crainy> he wouldnt
<Odin> 0That's mostly because of the fact that you had a personal part in making middle earth.
<CriticKitten> @lemonloaf: They don't just eat, they smoke and drink too. Didn't you hear Bilbo? :p
<RobotPinkie> oh no, not again
<Dat_Pon-3> AND BURNING TOAST IS SERIOUS SHIT!
<RanYakumo> Wait, don't they use those swamps later in the Two Towers?
<Crainy> Michael Bay would not want to direct LOTR
<Pegacorn> BTW guys,i'm gonna go to COMIC CON this september!

<Meanwhile> What if my little lords: michael bay is ring.
<Samwise> themarewhoarrangestheblocks: O_O
<Combustiblelemons> what would the world be like without nick cage?
<Gimli> 11Actually, Health experts say that a hobbit's diet would be healthier than the usual American 3-meals-a-day diet.
<RanYakumo> Yay deleted scenes!~
<Spazturtle> we are 1/4th through the movie
<eeveesprit> lemonleaf , your name is tasty
<Samwise> *brohoof Pegacorn!
<Crainy> WHO IS SHE
<Radagast> Michael Bay can't direct LOTR since he couldn't use black sterotypes.
<DSNesmith> Gimli sure, they're all farmers
<Moonstone_Charm> Just got back
<DSNesmith> they're working all day
<Moonstone_Charm> where are they now
<Elky> health experts must have a lot of time on their hands
<Moonstone_Charm> walking?
<Crainy> Michael Bay uses black stereotypes?
<Samwise> We are Spazturtle? I thought it was less.
<Pegacorn> I'M GONNA GET STAN LEE'S AUTOGRAPH!
<Rezo> Radagast: Are you implying the orcs aren't a black stereotype?
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Pegacorn> I AM BAWS
<DSNesmith> Radagast, easy fix, just have a couple of jive-talking Nazgul
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> he would have orcs be the steriotypes Radagast
<Gandalf> 4Well then, it would appear that we have come to an agreement of sorts
<Razyn> 0But, Gimil, is it known how much Hobbits eat in those meals?
<Crainy> LOL RACISM?!?!?!"§)"=$
<Starbuck> Radagast, it could be his first time exploiting midgets!
<Ponymensch> 1/4th through? I have a meet in the morning. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS! I wish I did.

<CriticKitten> Saruman is so good he doesn't need a mouth, bro
<Crainy> Americans are horrible in general
<DSNesmith> Sauron's so awesome his voice echoes in itself
<Samwise> Why the hell is Saruman a robot? Why is Gimli Mexican? Seriously, they all use guns?
<Pegacorn> JIVE ORC IS SPY
<RobotPinkie> If I go buy more ponies tomorrow, will everyone be jelly?

<DSNesmith> there is absolutely NO WAY that killing the trees will bite me in the ass, right? RIGHT?
<Guest_9001> Saruman got an echo within his echo
<mobileDCD> Michael Bay....
<mobileDCD> His crowning achievement was making Dutch.
<mobileDCD> Dutch should be in every movie in existence. It'd make them at the very least 20% cooler
<eeveesprit> c1. cut of three's

<Gimli> 11RANDOM WHISPERS TRIVIA: One of the indistinct words that Gandalf whispers to the moth when he is trapped by Saruman is "Gwaihir", the name of the eagle that later rescues him from the tower.
<Ponymensch> Gandalf is breton

<Rodman> No wonder the Nazgul are so pissed off
<FluxBrony> WHO WOULD WIN A FIGHT? A BALROG OR A MASSIVE SWARM OF PARASPRITES?

<FluxBrony> themarewhoarrangestheblocks lol
<Gimli> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Cate Blanchett joked that she took the role of Galadriel because, "I've always wanted pointy ears".
<Deady> Lmao
<Kenko> And here she exaplins, in High Elven, "Shortie, you are screwed."

<GoldMerc2_> We need a brony sword.
<Ghosties> di
<Ron_Weasley> 10lol lemonloaf
<RanYakumo> Spazturtle: In short, "I can ride faster than you, so I'll take him"

<Spazturtle> in the twin towsers EE their is a 10 miunit scene where they only speek elvish
<Gimli> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Pregnancy changed Peter Jackson's vision of "Lord of the Rings". Originally, he wanted to cast Lucy Lawless as Galadriel and Uma Thurman as Arwen. Unfortunately, both actresses became pregnant after being asked to read, and the roles were filled in by Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler, respectively.
<Felixfaust> live free or ride hard
<Legolas> 3*clop*

<Ghosties> 4OH SHIT, IT'S EOWYN
<ImperialMitre> filthy scoundrels
<Amorphic> Rairty rides EVERYPONY
<GoldMerc2_> If any pony was to let someone ride them, it'd be Pinkie pie
<Ghosties> 4FUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Elky> mare: I like Uma Thurman, but no
<Ron_Weasley> 10Ghosties is red spy
<Rezo> surely she'd let arwen ride her to safe frodo
<quill> moonstone_charm i was waiting for somepony to say that XD
<RanYakumo> Elky Except Prince Blueblood (before she met him at the gala).
<DSNesmith> or twilight

<Rezo> Arwen always dresses in style
<PrincessCelestia> inb4 awsome scene
<DSNesmith> and now Arwen is Glorfindel too
<ImperialMitre> the best part is moria anyways
<RanYakumo> Imagine if someone tried to adapt Lord of the Rings to modern times.
<Elky> Elves don't dress as well as Rainbow Dash
<Deady> Lolz

<Straduskye> I mad
<eeveesprit> ARE YOU A WIZZARD?

<FluxBrony> *SUDDENLY GILDA*
<Gimli> 11That title drop
<Amorphic> Title name fro
<MotownMurder> DUMBLEDORE
<CopperCogs> MOAR MAGIC!
<Amorphic> drop
<dispatchrabbi> I'm telling you the honest truth! Let go!
<FluxBrony> GILDAAAAAAAAAA
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> POWER
<CriticKitten> "Delayed." Gandalf's so badass, knocking him on his ass with telekinesis is just a minor inconvenience
<Combustiblelemons> reminds me of liquid vs solid snake
<Samwise> ring benders
<Straduskye> SUICIDE
<RanYakumo> BASE JUMP
<Starbuck> DING DING DING! Title drop!
<Amorphic> what the hell was fro?
<Meanwhile> like a boss.
<GoldMerc2_> Gilda powers, UNITE
<Fluttertreant> Gilda saves the day
<Combustiblelemons> ZUZU!
<Pegacorn> LATER BIATCH I'M BATMAAAAAAAAAAAAN
<MotownMurder> Pegasus wizard
<Straduskye> Gravity>Gandalf
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> GILDA IS THE HERO OF THIS MOVIE
<brodybrony> Gandalf just got 20% cooler
<RanYakumo> SO YOU HAVE CHOSEN...PONIES.
<MirthTinker> LIKE A BAWSS
<joetraincool> "Can you imagine if we had walked the whole way there!?"
<dispatchrabbi> Man, can you believe that Saruman has no ranged spells?
<Straduskye> Bird-thing>Gravity
<Samwise> Y U NO just fly bird to Mordor?
<lemonloaf> oh its one of the eagles you could have used to FlY TO MORDOR
<quill> *rolls eyes*
<AAAAPPLEOOSA> OH SHIT SON
<Radagast> And this is where Radagast redeems himself and saves Gandalf.
<Ron_Weasley> 10Gandalf = Batman is now canon
<Kenko> Thyere is one Lord of the Ring... Only o0ne... and he does not share cupcakes.
<ThunderDash> "Someone might've died!"
<WhatPayne> So why did they not fly to mordor?
<AAAAPPLEOOSA> HOW MUCH HAVE I MISSED
<Radagast> oh nothing
<FluxBrony> FRODO?!??!?!?!!?
<Samwise> Gilda is not an eagle
<Agent_Smith> Samwise, because Gandalf is an idito.
<Crickhollow> Suddenly sam
<Combustiblelemons> Y U NO FLY TO MORDOR
<Gandalf> 4I had to eat my bird on the way here, it was quite gamey
<joetraincool> One does not simply qwop into mordor
<Crainy> speaking of Batman
<Whizz_Bang> one does not simply fly into mordor!
<brodybrony> Sam was watching you sleep
<Amorphic> The eagles are afraid of mordor
<Combustiblelemons> Extreme plothole there
<eeveesprit> the new gandalf was ghostlies first
<Gandalf> 4Mr. Baggins
<Legolas> 3And counting
<Crainy> what are you guys thinking of Batman Begins?
<Amorphic> that's why they don't go
<Nyte_Crawler> one does not simply qwop at all
<RobotPinkie> In the book, Gandalf was actually saved by Rainbow Dash, but Peter Jackson hates ponies.
<Odin> 0Hey
<Dermathil> SUDDENLY AGENT SMITH
<chedduhr> @samwise then that eagle is her mom
<Meanwhile> MR Anderson
<MotownMurder> One does not simply clop into mordor
<WhatPayne> Mr Anderson
<Nittany_Tiger_> It's Agent Smith.
<desertman2> One does not simply fly into Mordor
<Straduskye> One does note simply ROCK into Mordor!
<GoldMerc2_> Agent Smith.
<FluxBrony> one does not simply clop into ponies
<dispatchrabbi> P.S.: They can't use the Eagles because they Eagles are not part of the current war. It's complicated but self-consistent.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> WhatPayne because, they um well...
<Purple`Prose> Hi Agent Smith
<GoldMerc2_> xD
<AAAAPPLEOOSA> You can't fly over mordor, that air is all ashy and shit
<Nittany_Tiger_> That Hugo Weaving.
<Radagast> Peter Jackson Y U NO RADAGAST
<GoldMerc2_> So many people saying the same thing...
<quill> One does not simply frolic into mordor Pinkie pie : BITCH PLEASE! *frolics*
<Crainy> SUDDENLY
<Riders> Can you say, Bromance, kids
<chedduhr> AND ITS ALL IN THE MATRIX
<desertman2> Dammit, stream paused on me

<Ron_Weasley> 10"Haybuck said... I wish I had more advanced notice of these. I would totally watch if I could free my apartment from pony hating roommates so I could steal the 42" TV. Really it's not that hard to do with 24 hours notice. XD"
<Fluttertreant> The herdmind is strong
<Nittany_Tiger_> Yes.
<Odin> 0How many favors does gandalf owe the eagle king now?
<Samwise> That was pretty gay, but I can still count the gay Sam moments on just one hand as of now.
<Straduskye> ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY X INTO MORDOR. Because it's NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.
<Meanwhile> One does not simply fly into mordor, because the ash clouds clog the wings.
<chedduhr> gay
<Ron_Weasley> 10just fyi anyway
<Nyte_Crawler> Its like another 2 hours till the pony episode, right?

<Riders> Safe from the Wraiths, only to be caught by the Red Skull
<Eowyn> 14Bilbo!
<GoldMerc2_> One does not simply watch my little pony to be a brony.
<Pegacorn> Or whatever.
<Nyte_Crawler> I mean, LotR is good, but so damn long for movies
<Meanwhile> Bilbo, who is now seriously old
<WolfyFluff> eeew old man hug

<Turtaguin> LAGGG
<Gimli> 11RANDOM WATER TRIVIA: The water used on the Rivendell set was brought in and contained chlorine. The entire water system had to be water-proof so that the chlorinated water would not leaked into the ground and contaminate natural water.

<Gimli> 11RANDOM TRANSLATION TIVIA: When Frodo is leafing through Bilbo's Book in Rivendell, a page with dwarven runes is shown. The runes translate thus: "Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks, and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole." This is a reference (actually a direct copy) to a map in the book
<Gimli> 11"The Hobbit" and the runes tell of the secret entrance into The Lonely Mountain.

<GoldMerc2_> 0Most likely...
<RobotPinkie> Pinkie Pie is the best pie.
<nah> @goldmerc2_ pinkie's not a magician. she's a reality bender.
<Straduskye> GoldMerc2_
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> pinkie pie would just break the fourth wall and beat sauron
<Gandalf> 4Except Trixie, of course
<Galadriel> 7the download came with 2 files

<Straduskye> nathandash is overcompensating
<RanYakumo> There's a non-brony here?
<BronyLagann> oh heck yes, got the chat next to the movie!

<Rodman> One question
<Ryan> seriously gandalf now would be a great time to mention the eagle
<Kenko> And nine it's a pi8ece fom cake.
<Straduskye> One does not easily transport onself into the location known as "Mordor"!
<Whiskra> inb4 epic sideshow
<Mistchill> MAAAAAAAAAAAIN THEEEEEEEEEEEEEME
<Suffuri> it premiers on a saturday? Well... thats odd.

<Crainy> moria....
<WhatPayne> Moria, that place is so dead...
<Straduskye> I think I just puked in my mouth a little
<Crainy> that will be fun

<TwilightSparkle> @apprentice1994 hi Apprentice!
<Dr_Klaus> *no, they must be offered to the high priestess*
<ForTheBronies> Times like these when we like subtitles...
<Ghosties> 4Why?
<Crainy> Boromir is a complex character
<doublestrand> no gandulshy
<globydorrikles> gandalf sparkle
<Straduskye> Elves: Commies. Dwarves: Ehm, 'MERICA. Orcs: Japanese people.
<Ghosties> 4I don't know what they're saying
<Meanwhile> Elijah wood was a murderer in sin city
<cirek> and ever
<Jewlob> what pony would da dwarf be?
<chedduhr> aragorn: twilight or rainbow
<DSNesmith> all the deleted scenes really help boromir to be a little less 2 dimensional
<ham993> Applesam
<Legolas> 3*Translation* Gimli is such a jackass, am I right?
<Elky> spike=frodo works
<Madadude> Dash - Aragorn
<Spazturtle> Dead people whiegh a loy

<Samwise> Rarity - Legolas, Applejack - Gimli, Fluttershy - Frodo, Twilight - Aragorn, Rainbow Dash - Sam (just kidding Boromir), Pinkie Pie - Merry/Pippin
<Elky> Twi=Aragorn would fit better

<globydorrikles> UP UP UP THE STAIRSSSSS
<Spazturtle> 1 whoul hour left
<Radagast> oooo
<RobotPinkie> You're Gandalf the Dead, of course you can translate.
<Apprentice1994> Someone needs to ponify Arigorn RIGHT NOW
<Madadude> na, lyra and bon bon = pippin and merry
<Ghosties> 4And now I'm thirsty
<Combustiblelemons> SHIPPING?? IN MY BRONYSTATE???
<HaysforPonies> So much blue
<Boromir> 12Boromir is the best character. No deleted scenes are needed to to establish that fact.

<Straduskye> Dash would be Gimli
<Donitz> gawd... this is... BOOORING
<prof-p> i would like to be a tree
<Radagast> carbonated Leverage?
<Ghosties> 4And I respectfully disagree. Gandalf is best character
<sotha> The elves are basically the best ponies.
<RDash> How does the elf witch perform magic without a horn?
<Crickhollow> If Fluttershy is Frodo, I guess Rainbow Dash would be Sam? Loyalty and all that
<DSNesmith> she's an evil enchaaaaantress
<Aponymous> Hey, I just remembered, Elijah Wood was in one of the Back to the Future movies.
<dispatchrabbi> Dash would be Aragorn.
<Combustiblelemons> This music needs more flute.
<Mastah_Mage> oooooo...shiny...
<Legolas> 3Twi is Gandalf, it is canon
<ninjapwny> celestia = gandalf

<shadowLurker> rinbow poni is best poni
<Dashite> inb4 elky kicked
<Amorphic> La plupart indubitablement
<Crainy> not the bakshi one
<globydorrikles> Galadriel is Zecora+Fluttershy+Celestia
<Apprentice1994> probably a reflection
<Meanwhile> Boob
<Legolas> 3Dont ya know? I am loyalty.
<Madadude> Aragorn is right
<ninjapwny> crainy: there's animated LOTR?

<ham993> Scootaloo is definitely Pippin
<chedduhr> frodo should be applebloom
<ninjapwny> the EqD chat, that is
<Dat_Pon-3> did i miss the part with YOU SHALL NOT PASS

<HaysforPonies> It's a cat on fire.
<FluxBropacitor> TRIVIA: This scenario actually happened in the book, where Saruman took over the Shire
<Draconaes> This movie needs more Prince Imrahil
<Meanwhile> <0>
<Crainy> its too overblown
<AAAAPPLEOOSA> look, it's industry!
<doublestrand> I SEE POO!!!
<Sindri> Sam is definitely Scoot
<Odin> I like how this is the only reference to the scourging of the shire...
<Painguin> Reflection Fail
<Dr_Klaus> Pippin is too wild to be sweetie
<Nyte_Crawler> Yeah

<techdude300> Can somebody explain this
<HaysforPonies> In the animated movie she literally walks around giggling then says "I passed the test"
<cirek> The TREE is fluttershy

<Crickhollow> Oh hai elven ring of power
