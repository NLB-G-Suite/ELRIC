<Discord> wow lots more people than I thought watching this
<TheHoodyNinja> WindWhistler: by talking about your religions view on homosexuality?
<Yahooz> Cool story
<Shizuka> 13it's probably more cause doom 3 senses the 30fps cap from scrcap and frees up a lot of CPU to handle things
<Sumica> 00,10I thought you had been snaping it to window cause y ou have the title bar and such
<TheHoodyNinja> dem legs

<killerpony7733> Wrek played blood?
<WindWhistler> I don't get the caption.
<Starflash> pretty good, alexxm :3
<WindWhistler> But for some reason I laughed.
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz: ??
<Alchemist> Bronysith: I dont mind if other players get all unlocks for money, because from what I've learned from BF2 is that most times its not the gun that decides battles but the player who wields it.
<Vordox> Shizuka: Mind I give you an epic song for your final battle? =3
<WindWhistler> Could someone explain what exactly that caption is supposed to mean?
<MahBoi777> oh wait...
<Ninjazz> MahBoi777, that was for you. TAB FAIL OF THE GREATEST KIND EVER. :D
<Shizuka> 13whatever your mind wants it to mean
<Azureflames66> Alchemist wise words....
<Shizuka> 13also i'm using the game music
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz: OH okay, Lol xD
<Wrek> 05yeah i played almost all 3d realm games killerpony7733
<Vordox> Awwww, no Metroid this time then. :(
<Shizuka> 13it's more spooky that way... makes shizu hugging demons funnier!
<WindWhistler> Shizuka: Oh, in that case I'm sure it's something dirty.
<killerpony7733> Wrek ah ok :)
<Jim> WindWhistler: There was this case in Miami where someone got high on bath salts and ate this guy's face
<|Discord|> MAH BOI!!!
<GilDash> Ninjazz: One does not simply tabfail himself. :D
<Vordox> You want SPOOKY music.eh...brb, Checking memory
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: seriously? the only reason you hate a game is an optinal dlc?
<MadSurge> Shizuka: agreed!
<Bronysith> Alchemist: i dont like to play games where it is populated by mostly little kids whos parents bought them an M rated game

<Ninjazz> Hey there, LadyCanary. :)
<Alchemist> Bronysith: well then you would hate ANY game. You can always try to ignore them if they are annoying you. Or try Project Reality if its still going, it has a more mature playerbase.
<LadyCanary> Hiya MahBoi777. Doin fine.
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: *corporation
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: COD and BF3 SUCK COMPARED TO THE AWESOMENESS THAT IS TF2

<Viri> 14how are you? :3
<Alchemist> Bronysith: if you dont like it, you dont like it, different people, different tastes, though I think its a shame that you'd be discouraged from a good game because of its playerbase.
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: how is that? i have a different opinion so you pity me?
<Shizuka> 13shizu time~<3

<Dark_Horst> correctly

<killerpony7733> Shizuka on it
<GilDash> Saturn: Just use napalm. :)
<drf-Droid> well that exam wasn't as bad as I thought it would be
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: but in TF2 if you equip a weapon. it gives you a buff and usually a debuff as well so as not to be cheap. the sniper rifle can only do full dmg when it is charged properly so there is no quickscoping
<Azureflames66> SHIZUKA
<Shizuka> 13i forget which PDA has it

<Jim> 404, code not found
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: ALSO very important. IN TF2 THERE IS NO STUPID IRON SIGHT AIMING
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: but calling bf3 unbalanced is just ignorant. i know what i'm talking about, i have tf2 AND bf3
<Wrek> 05yeah
<killerpony7733> Shizuka there you go :)
<GilDash> I love that little jump Shizuka just did. :D
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: so... you call actual aiming stupid?
<MahBoi777> someone dropped ketchup everywhere
*LadyCanary giggles
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: I LOVE TF2 because it sacrifices realism for actual fun
<Jim> they got red all over that place
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Doom 1 or 2 never HAD issues with not being aimable :P
<LadyCanary> Nah that aint ketchup
<MahBoi777> awwwwww
<drf-Droid> I likely passed the exam
<Jim> it's taco sauce
<Azureflames66> Dark_Horst you know what i love about bf3? The realism of sniping, having to account for windspeed and trajectory ^_^
<Angel_Espeon> 13Good to hear~
<drf-Droid> not sure about the class itself though :/
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: i play a game to escape reality
<drf-Droid> next exam in 20 mins
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: So, she has no problem with these letters? This is all in good fun?
<MahBoi777> Jim: Huzzah! :P
<drf-Droid> today is "hell day"
<Wrek> 05compared to doom 1 & 2 arch viles, doom 3 arch viles are pathetic
<Vordox> THANK YOU Bronysith
<drf-Droid> then a third exam after that
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yeah totally
<Azureflames66> Dark_Horst well maybe not wind speed but you know what i mean.
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> LadyCanary: Maybe my bro had a can of real blood there
<Bronysith> Vordox: RIGHT HERE BUDDY /)
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: no reason to call a game bead because it doesnt go into cartoon optics
<Shizuka> 13this room needs more railings
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: ALSO
<Jim> ^
<Alchemist> Wow, I understand if someone is not liking a game for certain reasons, but not liking an FPS because of iron sights is something I've never heard before.

<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: also what?
<Vordox> As for CoD, I say "Last stand" <-- reason why I hate that series
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TF2 is made by VALVE which is headed by a brony. is EA headed by a brony? NO so Valve and TF2 IS AUTOMATICALLY 20% cooler
<drf_Droid> god dang it
<MahBoi777> spiderses

<Vordox> Wrek: DARNIT
<drf_Droid> also downloaded Madoka DVDs
<CrimsonPhoenix> such minor detail
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: how is that? what does an idiot look like? also Valve is a corporation that does games right, making TF2 and L4D2 some really solid games
<drf_Droid> will watch those once my laptop dies on said flight :P
<Chrysalis> lol, there is no privacy on steam while there is a stream
<Angel_Espeon> 13awesome stuff :P
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: and they do not focus on releasing the same exact game every single year
<Randomnerd> Greek_Bronyxia: Doom 3
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: Not when you're saying it. The "s" is lingering...and for some reason it really annoys me.

<Angel_Espeon> 13I want to though
<drf_Droid> Taco Bell is like
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix Every time I hear Dialoge by the Girl i see Twilight saying it XD
<Alchemist> Thats why is mostly dark, narrow corridors and no/few open spaces in the game.
<drf_Droid> I call them Taco Hell for a reason :P
<drf_Droid> also brb
<Sundaysmile> lol
<GilDash> Wrek: id has always been a good company. With that said, I have a horrible feeling. Who is there publisher at the minute?

<drf-Droid> doing that is easier than nick changing/identifying LOL
<Wrek> 05probably bethesda, i have no idea
<Bronysith> Lil_B: thats awesome /)
<Wrek> 05but quake 4 was mostly a raven production
<Jim> Ain't no party like a chainsaw party

<Azureflames66> anybrony waiting for Dead Space 3?

<alexxm> why was there a chainsaw on mars in the firstplace
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Y-yes
<Bronysith> Shizuka: that chainsaw
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Yes*
<Bronysith> Shizuka: HOLY MARMALADE OF SWEET SUGARY GOODNESS they should make a gun that shoots chainsaws! somepony get on that already!

<Alchemist> ID was only the publisher then? I thought Id was a dev team.
<GilDash> Wrek: Dunno why, but I suddenly thought it might've been EA. My faith has been restored. :)
<Lil_B> Bronysith (\ one line in the end of the Intro "She makes me and my Sisters proud to have a Vagina" is perticualy funny
<Azureflames66> at least there's co-op Wrek
<GilDash> Alchemist: They are.
<alexxm> my mums always whinging about something
<Jim> A chainsaw gun? That might be crazy enough to potato
<Bronysith> Lil_B: o god my sides hurt
<Wrek> 05i dont want co-op in my dead space

<Bronysith> Wrek: what about pie?
<Wrek> 05i want coop in my squad based syndicate
<Wrek> 05not that generic abomination of a game with the syndicate naem on it
<Wrek> 05FUCK YOU EA
<Bronysith> Wrek: /)
<Jim> But they need a gun that shoots semi automatic chainsaws
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> -gets thawed- I am thawed
<Shizuka> 13q4 was good~
<Alchemist> GilDash: but Im confused. If Raven was the developer of Doom 3 and Id is also a dev team then who was the publisher? Or Id is both?
<alexxm> Dark_Horst would the chainsaw be on
<Bronysith> Jim: what about a gun that shoots another gun that shoots semi automatic chainsaw bullets?
<Wrek> 05Shizuka: yes~
<Azureflames66> And every time i see a chainsaw i keep remembering lollipop chainsaw >.<
<MahBoi777> like a crossbow that shoots flaming chainsaws lol
<Jim> Bronysith: We need to go deeper
<Dark_Horst> alexxm: one would supsect so
<GilDash> Wrek: I loved the original Syndicate. :)
<LadyCanary> Which I WAAAAAAAAANT Azureflames66
<Lil_B> "and the EA happened!"... 5 min later "and then EA happend... AGAIN!" quote from thespoonyone
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Bronysith:How about Let's get this gun and kill my bro
<Vordox> Why is Shizuka immortal...?
<Shizuka> 13fast regen health
<GilDash> Alchemist: id was DOOM 3. Raven was Quake 4 (apparently). I don't really know Raven all that well.
<Jim> Because being mortal is too mainstream
<Shizuka> 13usually i'm godmode so this is an improvement
<Wrek> 05ok activision published quake 4
<Wrek> 05raved developed it
<Vordox> Isn't that cheating...?
<Wrek> 05ID held the rights
<Bronysith> Jim: okay how about a gatling gun that shoots guns that shoots chainsaw bullets?
<Sundaysmile> I think it is
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> From making stupid noobook antic's
<Jim> Now you're talking!
<LadyCanary> ....What the hell...
<MahBoi777> whoa
<Azureflames66> gunceeption Bronysmith
<Lil_B> secretly enable godmode... let people think is pro for not dieing once
<Jim> Make the bullets shoot other bullets too
<Vordox> Isn't that cheating with regen health, Shizuka ?
<MahBoi777> more bullet per bullet
<Wrek> 05Vordox: so?
<GilDash> Wrek: Confusing enough? :D
<Wrek> 05let her play the way she wants
<Jim> AND fire the entire bullet too
<Vordox> D:
<Wrek> 05i run in guns blazing ot singing in the rain
<Wrek> 05thats my style
<Jim> 70% more bullet per bullet
<Vordox> But that's like taking a game and not put effort in it. :(
<Wrek> 05she has her own
<MahBoi777> indeed
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> ;)
<Om> Woops, slept a bit longer than I wanted to >.<
<Wrek> 05to*
<Angel_Espeon> 13okay wtf
<MahBoi777> ohai Om
<Wrek> 05Vordox: besides she still dies form the 1 shots
<Wrek> 05so is cool
<Vordox> The reason why games exist is for the rules, if the rules of the game design is broken... :(
<alexxm> hey Om hows your day been
<Azureflames66> shizuka always crouches and kills the enemies why? 0.o
<Angel_Espeon> 13now it's scanning through a folder called "blondes" apparently
<Angel_Espeon> 13what the heck is in that drive LOL
<alexxm> why was there a chainsaw on the moon anyway
<Shizuka> 13for the commandos
<Lil_B> Shizuka I don't know where you are, but in one of the rooms before the Final Boss you can find a Secret with an Audio-Log of the Developers
<Shizuka> 13means their tentacles miss
<Alchemist> Vordox: they exist for teh fun :)
<Shizuka> 13oh yes i know the id PDA :3
<Wrek> 05Azureflames66: for the commandos, dodging right next to the dodges their tentacle strike
*GilDash hugs Om.
<Shizuka> 13as you can tell, i've played this many times :3
<Om> alexxm: I was awake two hours ago for a few secds, I blinked and fell asleep again xD
<Wrek> 05them*
<Jim> hai Om
<Vordox> Alchemist: No, they exist for the reason they are existing, a game is a plane set by rules, that's the game.
<Lil_B> Shizuka :O
<Azureflames66> oh ok Wrek thanks for explanation
<WindWhistler> My bro's been sleeping for hours now...
<WindWhistler> it's 2:24 PM...

<Wrek> 05aaw
<Wrek> 05oh well
<Ponies47> Bronysith: :(
<Angel_Espeon> 13but this isn't online, it's stored on my PC and I never knew it was there LOL
<Alchemist> Vordox: change the rules-->play with different style--> new game experience-->expansion.
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> No worries Ponies47
*Lil_B puts on Gasmask, hugs GilDash, muffles "Hi Gildash!"
<Wrek> 05Shizuka: no grenades agaisnts bruisers ;3
*WindWhistler dies of boredom
<Vordox> Alchemist: Yeah but that's the cheapest trick in the book of gaming, something most developers with pride avoid at all cost.
<GilDash> Lil_B: It's okay now. :)
<Wrek> 05WindWhistler: liek tellign us will help that
<Lil_B> GilDash For you ;)
<Soital> 12anyone else use the PC other than you these days?

<Jim> Demon with guns? Oh my
<GilDash> GreeHetBronyInDuitsl: Holla! :)
<Lil_B> aww... there dies my favourite character :(
<Alchemist> Vordox: most (if not all) single player games have cheats, always had. I dont know why its a "cheap trick". you dont have to use them if thats what you mean.
<Soital> 12strange LOL
<Om> So much dooom @~@
<LoyalDash> Lil_B: :<, that is so sad...
*WindWhistler eventually gets tired of the rubix cube.
<Wrek> 05btw Shizuka: could you try the seogath without regen once atleast? :3
<WindWhistler> That's it, might as well try to 100% Cubivore...
<Vordox> Alchemist: No, repeating the same game with minimal Number changes
<Shizuka> 13:<
<Shizuka> 13but bfg
<LoyalDash> WindWhistler: Ugh, I never can solve that, I only get one complete side, not even 2.

<Ran> 2Always Flareon
<Om> MahBoi777: Nuuuuuuuu
<Azureflames66> thought you said swine for a sec Wrek
<WindWhistler> alexxm: It's a game where you eat and mutate and try to become King of the Cubivores, while defeating colorless cubivores and returning the Wilderness
<WindWhistler> It's a REALLY weird game.
<CrimsonPhoenix> WindWhistler, Cubivore is the bomb
<Wrek> 05yeah kelly is sabaoth
<Lil_B> Didn't they release the Doom3 Source-Code last year?
<Wrek> 05but he stole the bfg from cambell

<Jim> Jump!
<WindWhistler> Lil_B: As the name implies, Cubivore has a bunch of cube animals.
<Jim> or do that
<WindWhistler> They're kinda like those fold-up boxes.
<Jim> that also works
<Vordox> Wrek: What about Mirror's Edge?
<WindWhistler> Here, I'll get you the Wiki page
<Lil_B> WindWhistler oh, than i think I'm thinking about an other game :/
<Alchemist> What the hell is the use of that bridge. Being all transformer-ish and stuff...
<Azureflames66> to look dramatic
<Bronysith> Vordox: mirrors edge... i would like to see first person parkour revisited. but idk about mirrors edge
<WindWhistler> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubivore
<WindWhistler> Here's the wikipedia game
<WindWhistler> Lil_B: There are these little green bugs....but they're in 3D
<Alchemist> Bronysith: i loved it personally, though the controls were a bit glitchy.
<Wrek> 05fun fact: once the CPU was built, the found an volcano subcurrent right by it once they expanced the CPU. after that they had to install major extra coolant to keep it in check. henceforth the unstablility of the datanets on mars city
<Jim> Mirrors edge was fun
<Ponies47> Fun fact: I like ponies :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13I officially have 7p credit left on my phone
<Soital> 12LOL
<Azureflames66> fun fact: fun facts are fun
<GilDash> Wrek: Really? I always thought it was hell's influence.
<Vordox> Wrek: My suggestion of Mirror's Edge worth streaming? =3
<Bronysith> Ponies47: funfact:....
<Bronysith> Ponies47: EXTERMINATE!!!
<Lil_B> WindWhistler I HAVE heard of it :D , but the game I was thinking about still wasn't it XD, but I have only seen Videos of Cubivore, never played it :(
<Ponies47> Bronysith: NO
<Wrek> 05GilDash: where do you think betruger found hell in the first place?
<Bronysith> Wrek: painkiller? play that at all
<Azureflames66> funfact: crush, kill, destroy, swag
<Panda|Store> IM BACK WITH BOOZE!
*Bronysith slaps Panda|Store

<Bronysith> Panda|Store: only cider can be here
<Alchemist> Vordox: oh, definitely :)
<Ponies47> Panda|Store: YAY! :d
<Jim> Panda|Store: Let's get wasted
<Lil_B> Wrek there is a Character in doom 3 called Betruger?
<alexxm> Panda|Store can i have some
*Panda gives booze to every pony except Wrek
<Wrek> 05Lil_B: yeah he is basically the chief of the place. the guy with a glass eye
<Bronysith> here Wrek you can have my booze
<LoyalDash> Panda: That's kind of harsh...:D
<GilDash> Wrek: Via the teleporter. I was under the assumption that a crew went awry with Betruger in it, he became possessed, and came back as the even madder scientist hell bent on obtaining power.
<Ponies47> Thanks Panda :) *Chugs booze*
<Lil_B> Wrek I'm just asking because "Betrüger" is the german word for Betrayer
<Wrek> 05the teleporter sent them to the depts of mars
<Om> Panda: Oh fun
*alexxm chugs beer thanks Panda
<Panda> LoyalDash: well Wrek drinks too much :)
*Bronysith gives Wrek booze
<Ponies47> BRB

<Wrek> 05Panda: who are you, to judge me?
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Chole chole chole chole! :D I don't know what Chole means. :P
<GilDash> Wrek: Well, it's debateable as to whether Hell is actually on Mars or not. :S
<Alchemist> Lil_B: :D I love when game devs are SO subtle.
<Wrek> 05probalby
*Bronysith throws a keg of booze in Wrek s general direction

<Lil_B> Alchemist the japanese are even worse... you don't know how much german names and wors they use in their games and Animes :/ it's rediculus
<cowvarkian> Is it judgement when its true? wrek
<Wrek> 05that statement requirers you to have made up a decision. the decision being that i drink to much. you judge that i drink to much, henceforth in your emote you gave to all but me
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good afternoon

<Wrek> 05and arachnotrons
<GilDash> Wrek: Damn, I *hate* Pain Elementals. :D
<Alchemist> I hated pain elementals in Doom2
<GilDash> It'd be nice to see arachnotrons back though.
<Wrek> 05atleast in a sense
<Angel_Espeon> 13inb4 Kai used my PC
*Angel_Espeon is shot
<Wrek> 05would be nice with them crawlign around walls
<Lil_B> I think its funny that people couldn't reverse engenir Doom34 because John Karmack used some sort of code he made called "Karmack Reversed"

<Shizuka> 13it's attempting a manual override on the wall
<alexxm> was that the BFG
<GilDash> For Doom 4 they need to rely less on scripting and more on decent AI.
<Panda> Shizuka: xD dat reference :)
<Reikim> Shizuka: :D /)

<GilDash> Wrek: Wait, they had the concept art and never even put it in? Not even in RoE? The shame! :O
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> :O

<GilDash> Wrek: ... words actually fail me.
<Wrek> 05it was even modeled
<Shamroc> Wrek: i guess they coulndt find a large enough space to put it in ;p
<Wrek> 05i guess they never found a place to put it
<Wrek> 05aye
<GilDash> Wrek: How about replacing some of the damned ticks/trites for once? :D
<Vordox> Wasn't Doom mostly an open place to fight the demons? <.< In 1 and 2? in Doom 3 it's almost only corridors.
<Wrek> 05Vordox: doom 1 and 2 had its fare share of corridors too
<Wrek> 05fair*
<Vordox> Yeah, my memory says there was a few, but they were bigger then Doom 3 corridors?
<Reikim> Damn, you guys make Doom sound so fun. I'm kind of disappointed now that I never got to play it -_-
<Wrek> 05yes but doom 3 had an element of "realism" duct taped to it
<GilDash> re
<GilDash> Reikim: I'm sure if you look around you can find it.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've spent 3 hours on this computer doing pretty much nothing
<derpy_pony> 2:0 for spain
<Angel_Espeon> 13cuz of this stupid scan I'm having to do >:/
<GilDash> Wrek: Shame there wasn't any duct tape. :D
<Wrek> 05eeew football
<Soital> 12I know
<derpy_pony> so the finale will be spain - germany
<Alchemist> Wrek: I think ot was just an excuse for the badly optimized engine.

<Vordox> Awww.
<Wrek> 05there you saw the archvile in action
<Wrek> 05lame
<Lil_B> Doom 1 and 2 were basicly Shooting Gallerys, Doom 3 tried to be realistic and build up an Atmosphere
<Panda> DAMMIT!
<Alchemist> Wrek: WHAT??? I thought it was an Imp...
<Panda> BRB back to the damn store
<Om> Panda: What?
<Ponies47> Panda: Why :<

<Wrek> 05i gotta draw 2 archviles terrorizing ponyville
<Panda> Bronysith: THATS A GOOD IDEA!
<Panda|Store> brb
<GilDash> Wrek: You mean old school archviles? Ressurecting zombie ponies?
<Lil_B> LadyCanary maybe celestia banished somepony to the Mars :/
<Wrek> 05GilDash: yes
<WindWhistler> Why do ancient civilizations always have to have superior technology? Can't they just be primative?
<Shizuka> 13now... iirc we're traveling to site 3
<GilDash> Wrek: I look forwards to it. :D
<Wrek> 05dith doomguy beign equestrias only hope
<Shizuka> 13basically returning the soul cube home

<Shizuka> 13but before delta, we were in site 2...
<Shizuka> 13i'm confused about how the base structure is supposed to work
<Vordox> Doom Colt! :D
<derpy_pony> they are the best team in europe, twilight_sprinkle...only germany and the netherlands were rated nearly as good. netherlands are out now
<Reikim> Wrek: Write what?
<Wrek> 05Vordox: nope
<Wrek> 05human doomguy
<Wrek> 05works better
<Vordox> Wrek: make sure you draw Megan in too then :P
<Reikim> Wrek: What am I supposed to write?
<Wrek> 05the delta complex teleporter malfunctioned, leaving doomguy trapped on equestrian soil with a fwe supplies.
<twilight_sprinkle> derpy_pony: Germany shouldve won last world cup, spain got lucky cuz of umpire
<sagas> Shizuka is STILL playing Doom 3?
<Wrek> 05only to fidn otu hell followed him
*Reikim begins binging on Doom canon
<killerpony7733> sagas aye
<Lil_B> sagas until she wins
<GilDash> sagas: Hey, it's a good game. 'Sides, she's near the end now.
<Reikim> Also, what do I get if I write this crossover?
<Vordox> Wrek: are there going to be pony casualities....?
<sagas> I feel like shes played it forever though
<Reikim> And given how the Doomguy is mute, do I get free liberty with his personality?
<sagas> dat shitty night vision
<Shamroc> Reikim: he grunts...so hes not fully mute...
<Bronysith> oh hi Shamroc
*Bronysith glomps Shamroc
<Reikim> *functionally mute*
<alexxm> why is th lighting bad in some parts of this game
<GilDash> sagas: I swear it was yesterday and today. :D
<Vordox> Shamroc: I'm not sure he speaks Equastrian anyway...
*Shamroc dodges Bronysith's glomp
<Shamroc> yeah dont try that
<sagas> Can he decide what emotion he is expressing with his grunts?
<alexxm> hey Shamroc hows your day been
<Alchemist> Shamroc: given what he has been through...twice...maybe its his only form of communication :)
<Shamroc> alexxm..im really really tired...
<Lil_B> hi Shamroc ;)
<alexxm> so what excuality is the organic stuff coating everything
*Bronysith flies out the window and crash glomps into a crater which had a portal in it and the other portal connected to the ceiling above Shamroc and Bronysith glomps him hard
<sagas> alexxm: because it wants to be scary but its not
<Wrek> 05Reikim: well not really
<Wrek> 05maybe
<Wrek> 05slightly
<Shamroc> Bronysith: yeah no
<Wrek> 05keeping it realistic
<GilDash> alexxm: I think it was explained as hell pouring through into the base.
<alexxm> thanks GilDash
<Reikim> Wrek: ?
<sagas> Bronysith: That might have killed you both
<Wrek> 05a badass with some slightmental instabillity
<Reikim> Wrek: Sounds good. I was just planning on making him a snarky bastard, because snarky bastards are fun to write.
<Wrek> 05a bit better than the average marine complex, with the right ammount of douchebag
<sagas> snarky snarky snark snark... snarky
<Wrek> 05but understands whats oging on
<Wrek> 05and wants to save the qute ponies from total obliterations
<sagas> Yay douchey marine complex!
<Reikim> Dat cute with a q
<Vordox> Wrek: Like Hudson in Aliens 2, just replace Whiney with Douchebaggery?
<Shizuka> 13they really like those back spawns
<sagas> So have you been saving this time, Shizuka?
<Reikim> Wrek: Although I have to ask what the standard marine complex IS...
<GilDash> Reikim: Please do not write Doomguy as the comics depict him. :D
<Om> Wrek: Or he just wants to shoot stuff...
<sagas> Reikim: You know. The grunt hardass shaved head kind
<Vordox> Reikim: Draw some inspiration from *Every military movie ever*
<Shizuka> 13yes mommy
<Wrek> 05grunt
*LadyCanary giggles.
<Wrek> 05is best description
<Shizuka> 13two or three levels left i think

<Wrek> 05but mostly able to stand fast
<sagas> Reikim: Full Metal Jacket would serve you well
<Wrek> 05dont wussing on about it
<Alchemist> Reikim: to sum it up : "Come get some mothaf******"
<Wrek> 05not*
<Ponies47> sagas: That movie ie boss! /)
<Reikim> I like Alchemist's explanation. Succinct, yet detailed.
<Vordox> Reikim: I have a feeling if you do write it, Wrek WILL draw it. :D
<sagas> (\ That it is, Ponies47, that it is
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> How about fluttershy would meet Bugs bunny? I can't tell LOL
<Alchemist> q
<Shamroc> r
<Alchemist> sorry, thought chat derped
<sagas> GreeHetBronyInDuitsl: Fluttershy would be caring and kind as ever while bugs either tries to get away constantly or takes advantage of her
<Alchemist> too much quiet.
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Fine.
<Lil_B> What was the last thing wrek drew on the Stream?
<Vordox> Chat IS derping...
<Wrek> 05i do liek the idea that this isnt the first time the teleporter flukes. that somewhere maybe in the everfree 3 dead hazmat scientist are dead, and locations liek these are where he finds more ammo and weapons
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> How about fluttershy would meet me? I can't tell LOL
<Wrek> 05removign the element of he magicalyl has it
<sagas> Why is the game streamed at 30fps? Yesterday it was at 50
*RainbowJack hugs wrek
<alexxm> chat derped
<sagas> Doom Guy in equestria with a shit-ton of guns. I dont like where this would go
<GilDash> sagas: Hey, Doomguy is a good guy. :)
<LoyalDash> GilDash: Yeah, don't talk the talk, just fucking drink till you drop the drop.:D
<Alchemist> sagas: maybe with his state of mind he would think of the ponies as hellish abominations? :D
<alexxm> why Alchemist
*RainbowJack hugs Wrek
<twilight_sprinkle> is anyone else getting a lot of lag?
*Wrek hugs RainbowJack
<Shamroc> Wrek...question...with all the crap that doom guy has seen...woulndt talking pony's freak him out more and cause him to think they are also demons? or what not
<Lil_B> well... i das the ideo 3 days ago... I heard doom 1 and 2 are easily modable... could so it shouldsn't be that difficult to make everything MLP-themed XD
<killerpony7733> twillight_sprinkle eeyyp
<Om> Huray, we have reached level 2
<killerpony7733> eeyup*
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> alexxm What does fluttershy think about me?
<dr-whooves> Hay guyz
<Shizuka> 13ow
<sagas> GilDash: Hes a space marine. Nothing more. He doesnt do it because its morally right, he does it to survive. Who knows what he would do when ending up in a foreign universe
<Lil_B> hi dr-whooves
<Reikim> I think, upon meeting talking ponies, Doomguy would be sent straight into shock.
<Om> Ded?
<alexxm> hey dr-whooves hows your day been
<twilight_sprinkle> killerpony7733: ook, thought it might be me. btw press tab when typing a name for it to autofinish
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Hi Dr.Whooves
<Reikim> > Getting charged at by the hordes of Hell? Fine.
<sagas> DID YOU NOT SAVE, Shizuka
<Alchemist> alexxm: the guy have fought back hell. Twice. Alone. I think he might be a bit mentally unstable at that point and seeing talking fluffy ponies wont help his condition :D
<Lil_B> what would Doomguy do when he sees the Party Cannon?
<dr-whooves> nothing speacial, im gonna try and cover thsi day aria on flute
<Reikim> > Meeting cartoon talking ponies? Stunned into (more) silence.
<Wrek> 05Shamroc: "hmm, ponies that are remenissient of old gil cartoons, must be liek the bloddy grotesque demons ive killed before"
<GilDash> sagas: Actually in his back story he was sent to Mars for refusing to fire on civillians.
<Wrek> 05not really
<Wrek> 05GilDash: yeh
<sagas> GilDash: He was? Hell I would love to get sent to Mars. Sounds like fun
<Sumica> 00,10So is it just me or did Cain loose alot of his books in his travels?
<Vordox> Wrek: What about the ponies, their reactions to Doomguy AND Hell? :P
<GilDash> Why the feaking hay do I still know all of this stuff? :D
<Wrek> 05also note that we are talking about doom 3 doomguy
<Wrek> 05not doom 1 & 2
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Dr.whooves
<Wrek> 05as for the ponies freakign out
<Wrek> 05ofc they would
<Reikim> Difference?
<Shamroc> Wrek......you have a point...but again he might just have a thing in his ehad to kill everything he see's....seeing on how everythings trying to killed him..
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Do you know me dr.whooves?
<GilDash> sagas: Not when everybody coming back always bitches and complains how shit it is there, and they're there pretty much only because it's either the only job they have or for the pay.
<Randomnerd> Hrm. aw well.
<sagas> I feel Pinkie would surprise Doom Guy, resulting in him unloading a clip into her
<dr-whooves> i dont think so >.> should I?
<Panda|Store> BACK!
<Shamroc> wb Panda|Store...
<Reikim> Going dooooooooown...
<LoyalDash> Welcome back Panda|Store! And whgy you always keep going back to the store?:D

<Ponies47> Panda: What did you buy now?
<Om> Panda: where do you keep going!?
<Wrek> 05sagas: maybe reflex point gun at, mayeb fire a round form the machinegun and miss
<Panda> Bronysith: I got hot pockets
<Wrek> 05but nah
<alexxm> sagas they wouldn't know that though
<Ponies47> Om: The store
<GilDash> sagas: I think the ponies would sufficiently take him aback that he wouldn't start firing.
<Wrek> 05no reason to make it more grimdark than needed
*Bronysith glomps Panda
<Bronysith> Panda: GIMME
<Panda> Om: well... i keep skating to the store like full speed and i get home... and it seems my memory fails me
<Lil_B> I'm gone for now, see you ether later or (more likely) tomorrow ;)
<Om> Panda: Must be close by....
<GilDash> sagas: Doomguy has been shown time and time again to have a very level head throughout the game.
*Panda hands Bronysith a cold hot pocket,
<alexxm> bye Lil_B
<Panda> Om: no.. about 15 minutes away
<sagas> No he is used to seeing strange things. Hed assume they were hell spawn
<Om> Panda: Oh you. And I was starting to think I was the only short sighted one xD
<LoyalDash> Panda: ......that is impossible!
*Lil_B hugs alexxm

<Alchemist> whats a hot pocket?
<sagas> Wrek: Well its fanfiction. I could see it going either way
<alexxm> hey Elondras what have you been up to
<GilDash> sagas: No, I mean reacting calmly to the situation. It just so happens the situation calls for him to shoot everything.

<cachi01> hi everypony :)
<Wrek> 05sagas: not really
<Reikim> Takes place in 2083, and they still use lousy physical PDAs. And their Internet probably sucks. 2083 must be a crappy year to live.
<WindWhistler> sagas: you can never be prepared for that
<sagas> Mars doesnt get good signal
<Vordox> An answer to that, Wrek? A serious attempt at Doomguy going to Equastria?
<Wrek> 05Reikim: 2083 visualized 2005
<Alchemist> sagas: not more than we would be prepared for a magical dragon invasion.
<Wrek> 05PDAs were like

<Randomnerd> So I've been looking for work in Albany, NY, where I went to college. I'm hoping to land a job at a posh hotel there. I might be able to make money on thes side blackmailing politicians XD
<WindWhistler> This was made in 2005?
<sagas> posh is such a posh word
<Vordox> Wrek: Guess it's going to be a challenge for Reikim then
<Reikim> Wrek: Come back tomorrow during the BMN, I'll have progress for you.

<Alchemist> Panda I do, but Im too damn lazy to mow the lawn.
<Ninjazz> Panda, your mom sounds fun. :D

<Panda> Wrek: good ^^ i love you more
<WallDives> cachi01, yeah.

<Wrek> 05i promised myself never to do drugs again so
<Panda> Wrek: again? :)
*sagas is killed by the force of a trand-dimensional space telephone booth crashing into him driven by Bronysith1

<RustyMeat> Wait double?
<Shizuka> 13canary canary~<3
<Vordox> LadyCanary: No MsFortune? :(
<Panda> Wrek, you know, you are cool :)
<RustyMeat> How does that work
<WallDives> Peacock would have to be a challenge, I'm sure.
<Om> WallDives: Were you one of them
<LadyCanary> There was also a Double in her WTFBBQ form but I missed her.
<cachi01> mmmm valentine :3
<MadSurge> LadyCanary: will you give us pics eventually? :3

<WallDives> Om, HELL NO. I'd cosplay as Mario or Bob.
<Om> WallDives: I'm sure you would make a fine lady. :D
<sagas> Anyone see the video with doom guy vs master cheif?
<cachi01> LadyCanary: i need pics of valentine

<Dark_Horst> btw, are you guys aware that the new newsletter STILL leads to the old one when clicked?
<ACS13123> Know the WHOLE story

<cachi01> ACS13123: and brotherhood and revelations
<ACS13123> chachi01: done
<sagas> Reikim: Then never pay it. What are they gonna do? Hunt you down?
<ACS13123> cachi01: actually im on Revalations right now
<Om> WallDives: Lol yes, the muscle makes it more memorable
<cachi01> ACS13123: revelations was lame IMO
<MadSurge> WallDives: I kinda do but it's hard to because of that bug for the PS3 version. Did they fix it yet? :D
<WallDives> wow, that peacock isnt bad.
<WallDives> MadSurge, I dont know, I have 360...
<ACS13123> cachi01: coulda been worse
<Randomnerd> WallDives: 260 lbs?!

<ACS13123> sagas: ACS- My initials 1312 - My birthday (13th december) and a random 3, it was originally ACS1312 but that was taken on youtube so I settled for ACS13123, and I've used it ever since
<Alchemist> Om: with the flashlight, yes.
<GilDash> Om: If you switch to fists first.
<sagas> well Shizuka just told us she died, but we havent seen it
<Shizuka> 13there's only a couple major spots that are padding
<Shizuka> 13nope not ded
<Om> GilDash: That's kinda silly.
<Shizuka> 13reloading video
<MadSurge> Why is it all grey :D
<sagas> ACS13123: that makes sense
<GilDash> Om: It's based on old games. Good games, but with older mechanics. As I recall, that was one of the main critiques against it.
<Bronysith> ALL OF DA WIN http://cs11224.userapi.com/u12816927/-14/z_8a13a548.jpg
<Elondras> MadSurge: refresh

<Reikim> Yeah RAWRity?
<Ponies47> RAWRity: What?
<Shamroc> RAWRity...moop
<RAWRity> I think I've found, quite possibly, the shittiest anime ever.
<cowvarkian> doubtful
<Reikim> Oh this oughta be fun! Which one?
<WallDives|Skullgirls> RAWRity, Power Stone?
<WindWhistler> I can see what's going to happen...
<MegaMoonShine> Dis gun b gud
<RainbowJack> D'aaaaaawww
<RAWRity> "Oniichan no Koto Nanka Zenzen Suki Janain Dakara ne!!"
<Reikim> RAWRity: Translation?
<RAWRity> which translates to "I Don't Like You At All, Big Brother!!"
<cowvarkian> ... seems legit
<RAWRity> and good CHRIST is it awful.
<Ponies47> Sleeping with Hinako is also really bad I heard.
<WindWhistler> I never knew there was such thing as a bad anime. :o
<RAWRity> and I've seen some awful anime.
<Reikim> inb4 suicide
<Reikim> Or not.
<RAWRity> Like, I've seen Garzey's Wing.
<MegaMoonShine> Work montage!
<RAWRity> and Eiken

<MegaMoonShine> Ponies47: :| In before
<LadyCanary> RAWRity: LOL Martial Hearts WUT
<DeadpoolDash> ikki tousen was fun
<Shizuka> 13like everyone else in purgatory, their life was taken from them in the most unfair way possible
<Reikim> RAWRity: I guarantee you there's a shittier anime out there. It's probably a Hentai, though, so you and I would never see it.
<WindWhistler> so that's how he died.
<LadyCanary> ...Oh balls.
<Shizuka> 13you will see
<Ponies47> MegaMoonShine: What?
<RAWRity> Shizuka: purgatory?
<cowvarkian> what bout it RAWRity
<DeadpoolDash> manyuu hikenchou....queen's blade
<RAWRity> suddenly it's Haibane Renmei
<MegaMoonShine> Ponies47: Basically you say it to state something you think is about to happen
<Shizuka> 13i should do haibane after this
<Shamroc> sadness
<Ponies47> MegaMoonShine: Okie doki loki :)
<RAWRity> Shizuka: I'd love to see the chat's reaction to that.

<RAWRity> also, LadyCanary have you seen Martial Hearts?
<Reikim> Shizuka: What other anime do you have on hand?
<cowvarkian> well, I just have the chat open Shizuka... so yeah
<GilDash> Wrek: Pretty much sums it up for me. :D
<LadyCanary> Nope, RAWRity. Never heard of it, but it sounds quite silly.

<CCCP> ponies are cool
<Ponies47> You know when I was at the store looking at the MLP toys all there really was alot of Canterlot stuff.
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: The first 4 eps of it are just badly animated fanservice and pointless fetish costumes and whatnot. Then the 5 episode turns it into fucking Old Boy
<Wrek> 05Panda: nope
<GilDash> Wait, did one of those guys just speak plain English? :S

<NightShade> I keep wanting to know what's on that poster

<Anotherguy> Ponies47 Watch what you say to random people. They might have wisdom to share.
<Ponies47> DocSane: True.

<Skylands> 10[17:50] <%drfsupercenter> somebody who broke their Macbook and can't live a day without it <- Maybe. Plus, Bermuda is more expensive than the US due to lolimporting (and higher tax, I think), so why anyone would want to pay even MORE for an Apple device?

<AnnoyingBrony> hi
<Anotherguy> Well, come to think of it, my brother like Digimon and he's 17...

<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hi GilDash and Nittany_Discord.
<GilDash> sagas: Shenanigans is such a funny word. We should totally do it. :D
<FairysHuff> Ponies47: Rules number 1. Never ever say your a peadophile ^_^
*ZappyTheUnicorn hugs sagas back.
<pyrocatboy> 3
<FairysHuff> Ponies47: But I joke ^_~
*sagas whispers in ZappyTheUnicorn ear "missed you"
<Hogia> 12Hai
<ZappyTheUnicorn> So...how is everypony.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts ZappyTheUnicorn
<ZappyTheUnicorn> sagas: ...wat?
<GilDash> FairysHuff: Don't joke about that. That's a good rule. :D
<GilDash> ZappyTheUnicorn: Recovering. Yourself? :)
<sagas> GilDash: So the first rule is that Modas have authority. Fuck the police!
<FairysHuff> Unahppy. The Fluttershy shirt I wanted has an insane shipping cost attached. So won't be getting it any time soon
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol teams are a bit unbalanced xD
<ZappyTheUnicorn> GilDash: Recovering? What happened?
<sagas> ZappyTheUnicorn: you heard me
<ZappyTheUnicorn> sagas: yeah...
<GilDash> ZappyTheUnicorn: Some crappy cold yesterday. Might well have been flu. :S
<sagas> ZappyTheUnicorn: Then why did you ask what I said
<ZappyTheUnicorn> GilDash: That sucks.
<GilDash> sagas: I wouldn't provoke the mods. :D
<sagas> GilDash: But we gotta break ALL the rules!
<FairysHuff> GilDash: People will think that of us no matter what we do. People see peadophiles everywhere anyway. Society is paranoid about them thanks to media.
<GilDash> ZappyTheUnicorn: Yeah. Fortunately I've gotten over the worst of it by this morning. :)
<Ponies47> FairysHuff: Okie doki loki :)
<ZappyTheUnicorn> sagas: What you said and how you said it made me feel uncomfortable... *shrugs*
<GilDash> FairysHuff: It still helps not to shout "I'm a peadophile!" wherever you go. :D
<FairysHuff> GilDash: This is true ^_^
<sagas> ZappyTheUnicorn: Oh my apologies then. Strictly plutonic
<GilDash> sagas: That's the only rule I wouldn't break. :$
<ZappyTheUnicorn> sagas: Don't worry about it. :)
<sagas> GilDash: Fine then. Rule 2: Respect other users
<Cotton> music getting boring :|
<FairysHuff> GilDash: Must... resist... use ... of ... innuendo. GGAAAAH! >_<

<DeadpoolDash> Rule 34; .....
<sagas> GilDash: Well Ide say task complete
<GilDash> FairysHuff: Bring it on. You might just get some back. ;)
<GilDash> sagas: Tsk, you'll have to try harder then that. :p
<sagas> GilDash: Rule 3: Dont post non-image links during streams. cnn.com

<FairysHuff> Rule number 2046: Don't eat Burritos on a buddhist holiday.
<sagas> GilDash: I already did! I said I no longer respect you.
<sagas> GilDash: You are a worthless human being. Good enough?
<GilDash> sagas: Nope. Try harder. ;)
<FairysHuff> What exactly is happening here between you two?
<sagas> GilDash: How much more disrespecting can I get?
<Cotton> oh thank god
<GilDash> FairysHuff: I've no idea. I'm enjoying it though. :D

<FairysHuff> I know of a great way to disrespect GilDash. Tell him he's a Justin Beiber fan. ^_^
<Chains> "THE SNIPER THROWS PISS AT PEOPLE AND LIVES IN A VAN!" -Spy
<sagas> GilDash: You are a miserable cretin. You are a waste of space and resources. Good enough?
<GilDash> FairysHuff: That... that's a horrible thing to say to *anybody.*
<Chains> Anypony*
<Chains> Typo.
<FairysHuff> GilDash: Yes. Yes it is ^_^
<Om> Done eating, back to mane chat I return

<GarrettBrony> What is Saturn On anyway
<FairysHuff> Om: It was once used as an anti-depressant but is now used as a painkiller.
<Polydunami> Codeine.
<Chains> Cocaine?
<Om> FairysHuff: Are you depressed? Or was it for the painkiller?
<Polydunami> ...
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<GilDash> Om: For his migraine.
<Polydunami> Medicine is not your strong suit, I see...
<FairysHuff> Om: I have Fluoxetine for the depression. Amatryptoline works much better as a painkiller.
*GarrettBrony makes the pain go away
<Om> Oohhh
<Chimera> Hay
*Om stabs chat
<Samurai_Shippo> And the chat probably bled for being stabbed
<GilDash> Om: What the hay? :O
<FairysHuff> Many people assume that you can just break yourself out of a depression. What they don't realise is that some of us are phsyically and chemically predisposed to depression. So medication is a must
<kirzstryfe> 8,6good evening everypony :)
<Om> :$
<Polydunami> How's the art, kirz?
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello kirzstryfe

<FairysHuff> Airpuff: Well since starting the Fluoxetine last year my self-harming fantasies and extreme self=loathing have lessened so thats nice ^_^
<Samurai_Shippo> Only if I'm drinking.
<Airpuff> FairysHuff: yeah yeah, it works.. but its not a must in the process of getting better.. Since it is possible to get over it without too :P
<GarrettBrony> Anypony else physced for the Wreck it Wralph movie to come out?
<Samurai_Shippo> Eventually I'll have a friday where im not playing Magic and join you guys for movies again

<Om> Panda|TF2: YOu playing?
<Airpuff> Anyways ima join myself soon.. so dw :P
<Panda|TF2> Om: yeah... :( i suck
<FairysHuff> Airpuff: Thats what I was trying to explain. SOme people become depressed through situations while others like myself are physically predisposed to it. So I will ALWAYS be depressed because of the way my brain in made.
<FairysHuff> Airpuff: I just have to live with it.
*Chains splashes a bucket of industrial lubricant all over Nittany_Discord and pushes him down a hill

<FairysHuff> otakon: In a sense yes. But it's quite different. NEDs here are the ones that stand on street corners, harassing people, wearing sports clothing they couldn't possibly afford, tucking their trousers into their socks and getting drunk and occassionally dealing drugs.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> So, what's wrek trying to do?

<Barbetos> Snowflake
<Polydunami> Do your worst :3
<Saturn> 08,01you might ask yourself, "why is Saturn friends with a fundie christian?"

<panda> Saturn ^^ you should tell her to hook up with you XD
<junh1024-XD> Durr

<Saturn> 08,01the moral of this story is: even fundies and homosexuals can bond over sci-fi
<Polydunami> Okay, I'm done
<Reikim> Saturn, that is such an amazing thing and gives me hope for the human race.
<Saturn> 08,01eh, bi, gay, all the same to them
<Reikim> My day has been given hope.
<Spriggals> Mmm Indeed.
<Spriggals> Yes indeed.

<Spriggals> CLASSICAL!
<Prick> bi = both, gay = one kind
<Polydunami> That's bucking hilarious :D
<xmasskills> thanks
<Saturn> 08,01i think the way i put it to her was "we promise not to rape your priests, if you promise not to set our fabulous clothes on fire while we mince"
<panda> Prick: well i know that....
<FlaxMan> Its been a while for me, but now that schools out I'm here and happy. :3

<drf|Mibbit> THIRD attempt at burning Madoka disc 2
<panda> Ponies47: never liked it ^^
<drf|Mibbit> that anime is cursed, it keeps breaking my computer
<|Discord|> My mom won't take me to bronycon but she will take me to Canterlot Gardens
<Dken2021> what is this, an all out melee war?
<Canadian_brony> You guys need some good archers and a Scout with the Candy Cane. A medic would be nice as well
<drf|Mibbit> it'll get to about 25% and then completely freeze, and ImgBurn is stupid and can't be killed
<drf|Mibbit> you have to reboot
<Ponies47> panda: Yeah. I gave it a chance and it failed. :|
<panda> Ponies47: ^^
<junh1024-XD> i use nero7
<panda> Ponies47: but still... love and tolerate
<Ponies47> panda: ^^
<drf|Mibbit> >Nero
<drf|Mibbit> >Dual layer
<Ponies47> panda: *squees* Love and tolerate
<drf|Mibbit> Not to mention I found a very convincing blog on why you shouldn't ever use Nero to burn DVDs
<junh1024-XD> what? i used it to burn VOBs on DL
<drf|Mibbit> and the people at Digital Video Forums know their stuff
<Spriggals> I pretty sure 79th's Farewell To Gibraltar would fit as background music
<junh1024-XD> something about layer breaks>?
<drf|Mibbit> never mind that LIGHTNING UK who makes ImgBurn is a mod there, I swear it doesn't affect their opinions at all
*drf|Mibbit runs
<drf|Mibbit> that, plus a certain 32KB gap between IFO/BUP files that Nero ignores
<Om> Tolerate and less tolerate
<junh1024-XD> true, true.
<drf|Mibbit> it's fine for data discs but for video they said not to use it
<panda> Om: :(
<Ponies47> Om: :'(
<Dken2021> hate and bicker
<junh1024-XD> weel, which version of nero?
<Canadian_brony> Dken2021 that's thinking like a Parasprite
<FillyFlam> Hate and discriminate.
<drf|Mibbit> whatever one was current when they wrote about it
<FillyFlam> Ah! It rhymes.
<Canadian_brony> FillyFlam same for you
<drf|Mibbit> I've got Nero 9 or something now but don't really care
<Om> panda Ponies47: :|
<Ponies47> *Throws Dken2021 into a bunch of Parasprites* JOIN EM! :[
<drf|Mibbit> ImgBurn is Free®
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I really need that sword set for the demo.
<Dken2021> nein!

<Ponies47> Dken2021: Fine. But be nice :)
<drf|Mibbit> k
<drf|Mibbit> also look, ImgBurn froze again
<drf|Mibbit> I'm gonna end up wasting so much money on these stupid DVDs before it actually burns
<SilverSonic> drf: i have a question to ask
<panda> Om: :(
<Dken2021> dat macgyver
<SilverSonic> what exactly is rooting (phone wise) and what can you do with a rooted phone
*Canadian_brony hugs Dken2021
<SilverSonic> i've never bothered asking before
<Om> panda: What >_<
<panda> Om: you mean :(
<Canadian_brony> durka?
*Dken2021 hugs Canadian_brony back :D
<Ponies47> Ohai Canadian_brony :)
<Om> panda: Sometimes I am.
<drf|Mibbit> it's the equivalent to having an admin account on a computer
<junh1024-XD> rooting iirc applies to android phones
<Dken2021> never seen macgyver, but luuv the title music
<panda> Om: why cant you be nice? :(
<Canadian_brony> hi Ponies47. When did Wrek start playing TF2?
<drf|Mibbit> it lets you do things that need higher permissions, like blocking ads, taking screenshots, deleting system apps
<otakon> Dken2021: it's fun
<junh1024-XD> rooting an android phone allows you to run pirated apps
<drf|Mibbit> like those stupid nagware crap that comes with it
<drf|Mibbit> um
<Canadian_brony> I think it's Wrek, anyway
<junh1024-XD> rite?>
<drf|Mibbit> you can run pirated apps without root
<Ponies47> Canadian_brony: A long time ago. :P
<junh1024-XD> oh
<otakon> Canadian_brony: earlier, he's been at it for an hour or so
<drf|Mibbit> but you need root to do system-level stuff
<Om> panda: Because you didn't eat enough.
<drf|Mibbit> like deleting system apps
<drf|Mibbit> blocking ads, as it modifies system files
<drf|Mibbit> and so on
<panda> Om: i didnt?
<Om> panda: No you didn't.
<drf|Mibbit> oh, and free wi-fi tethering.
<Canadian_brony> Ponies47 otakon dayum

<Shizuka> 13cause it requires using shotgun
<FieryMasterpiece> l
<Ponies47> Ohai Litwick. Nope.avi :P
<Shamroc> Nyria: bs...you kept killing me over and over
<Om> panda: Huza, >.> the pointlessness has been doubled!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I'm at a disadvantage since I don't have half the crap everyone else does.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Including the Demo set I keep asking about.
<Wrek> 05what set?
<Nyria> Shamroc: That was this game, the last game I had 19 kills and about 40 deaths~ Not my best game~
<Canadian_brony> is it still possible to get into the server? I haven't played TF2 in a month-and-a-half
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The sword and shield.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord i can give you the sword and boots but no the shield
<Wrek> 05dont need the set ones
<panda> Om, im not sure if its a bad thing completely... the homeless have to take care of a puppy... i guess to save puppies and panhandlers?
<Wrek> 05any sword and shield does and you are ready to demo knight
<Shamroc> Wrek: dat lan server
<Reikim> I'd give away my surplus items, but I'm f2p.
<FieryMasterpiece> Nittany_Discord: PONIES!!! :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't have a sword or shield period.
<Litwick> And to be honest? Seeing the shit her girlfriend's mtoher is putting her through? I will honestly not watch anything pony related for a month if it means that the situation could get better.
<Sumica> 00,10Did Shizuka ever get a shield?
<Shizuka> 13jaja
<Canadian_brony> Nittany_Discord I think i may have a few I could give you

*Bronysith glomps Reikim through the heavens

*Chains has left
<Sumica> 00,10that was a fun kill spree I got at one point.
<Om> panda: Yeah. Its not fun :\
<Shizuka> 13not sure volcano fragment is worth crafting
<Sumica> 00,1010 in a row
<panda> otakon: haha thats how i became street smart though ^^ no regrets
<Nyria> otakon: My death count~
<panda> Om: meh...
<Bronysith> Shizuka: hows that shield treating you?
<Canadian_brony> Sumica is there an open slot in the server, or am I too late?
<otakon> hiya Shizuka and WHAT are you talking about?
<Shamroc> Shizuka: nope its not
<Om> panda: :D
<Shizuka> 13i think it's better
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord there now you only need to found a shield
<Reikim> Shizuka: It's an ax. That's on fire. That's all I need to know.
<Sumica> 00,10no clue. I took the server crash as a good time to stop
<Shizuka> 13traded the booties away months ago...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Is that a random drop?
<Canadian_brony> Shizuka any weapon is cheaper to buy than craft
<panda> Om: hows that for optimism XD
<Wrek> 05ok server up in a sec
<Athgaar> can the sniper backpack be crafted?
<Shizuka> 13except you have to deal with random people that want to scam you
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord everything is random drop
<Om> panda: Prety damn high panda, pretty damn high.
<Reikim> Hm, maybe one more map, then I have to go write things. And stuff like that.
<panda> Om: like the rent? :D
<Bronysith> gurren lagann is best anime ever
<Litwick> I honestly am about to just break down and WEEP I'm so worried about her. Pretty much if she doesn't find a job OR get the 400 dollars to move out, she'll be FORCED to move away from HER GIRLFRIEND
<Om> panda: Just like rent, but in the oposite direction! A different high.
<Reikim> Maybe get started on Wrek's Doom crossover, which will be strange but fun because I never got to play Doom.
<Canadian_brony> Crafting is a good way to waste scrap. I only craft weps when I can't clear my BP and nobody's buying
*Shizuka 13hugs TheGreatAndPowerfulT <3
<Shizuka> 13danke~
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even the achievement stuff?

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> :3 no problem
<Shizuka> 13the achievement stuff i just farmed bots for
<Om> panda: I don't know?
<panda> Om: XD that was a joke
<Reikim> Litwick: I swear I'd help if I could. I really would. I just don't know what to do. I'm not in a position to donate, so what then?

<killerpony7733> superretroworld: like i waas some other number before pony_7733 then i sometime later went with my current one but that very early pony_*number* was from when i was just observer for small amounts of time
<Ponies47> Season 3 of MLP FIM :)
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Randomnerd> MLP, GoT
<Phase4> 00,02must be pulling from the wrong log
<Drake> 04Cats are adorable, so my point still stands.

<JRP2234[Silly_Filly]> Booo

<Polydunami> What happened to the permabanned Lyra, did she try to evade a ban or something?
<Reikim> Okay, gonna stop paying attention to this, time to watch the mind-screw giant robots.

<Om> Heights are Scarry T~T and I am going up the space needle this summer uuuuhhhhg
<otakon> CCCP: constant trolling of inappropriate content

<Polydunami> I guess I hit it on the head, there
<Phase4> 00,02right now she's a medic in the military, deployed somewhere, so we wont see her for months either way
<Ponies47> I had a temp ban once. It wasen't fun. :(
<CCCP> otakon: but we didn't have to ban them :s
<Om> otakon: I have been there once before....I don like it
<Reikim> Wow, Bronystate really gets all sorts.

<Reikim> otakon: Well that sucks pretty badly. Keep at it, though. An opportunity will present itself, or you will create one.
<otakon> Alister: well my mom wanted me to go to college but I didn't want to go immediately or have to worry about being in debt for 20 years.

<DeathStar> why dosen't my cat understand that a jacket is for one person not one person and a cat!
<otakon> Alister: I've been out of work for 10 months and it's not from lack of looking. I need assistance.
<Reikim> otakon: There are ways to avoid debt from college. My parents managed to get theirs paid off in about 10 years.
<otakon> DeathStar: and hello dear.
<Ponies47> Sorry won't be here for Friday Movie Night. I'll be here for Euro Movie Night. :)
<DeathStar> hello otakon
<Reikim> otakon: I'm aiming to follow their example.
<otakon> Reikim: yeah, but that was HOW long ago in comparison to now when costs were lower?
<Alister> otakon: Trust me , My brother dropped out 1st year of college to wait another , he never got back to studoes
<Reikim> otakon: True, that's a good point. The world kind of sucks doesn't it.
<otakon> Alister: well I didn't go to begin with but I see the similarity.
<otakon> Reikim: eeyup
<Alister> Altough , I can't say our situations are comparable , My province has some of the lowest costs of superior education
<otakon> and that's why I like being here
<Reikim> Alister: Which one?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Iron_Edge: Nice.
<Alister> Reikim: Québec
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No outfit, though. Not enough time?
<otakon> this place does not suck at all...unless you're talking time.
<Alister> But we still have whiny students complaining about the prices
<Reikim> Alister: Thought so. I remember being taught something about that, a while ago...

<Skylands> 10Mother asked a question about iPad
<Reikim> Alister: Ah, you said "Damn Liberals" so I assumed you were referring to the party specifically.

<PrincessLuna> Sorry, the chats being a douch
<Pattyrick> Have you had any luck on your iPod, drf?
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<otakon> PrincessLuna: it happens sometimes
<drfsupercenter> 03I jailbroke it
<Airpuff> Hai PrincessLuna :P
<Om> panda: I'm leavin now!
<Pattyrick> Selling it like you wanted?
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03nah
<drfsupercenter> 03I still have it
<drfsupercenter> 03someone want to buy it? :P
<panda> Om: :( why?
<Reikim> Tsk, Alister...a government will never be able to offer true freedom. The human race is similar to sheep in that, without restrictions and guidance, we will inevitably wander and become victims of our own nature.
<otakon> panda: he's taking a nap
<Pattyrick> No, just wonderin'
<panda> otakon: oh
<Om> panda: Need to nap e_e I'll be on later
<panda> Om: have a good nap ^^ i was gonna take one too... but im on the clock^^^
<PrincessLuna> Anypony in the ranks of the New Lunar Republic?
<Ponies47> Hello PrincessLuna :)
<Pattyrick> I do have a question about a certain computer
<drfsupercenter> 03k
<otakon> Reikim: yeah, but goddammit I wish the US gov't would stop looking out for the goddamn 1% in our country
<panda> PrincessLuna: RIGHT HERE SIR!
<Alister> Reikim: All a governement has to do is assure the principle of non-infraction
<Om> panda: Alright then :) good luck to you AND I"M GONE!
<Pattyrick> On that same night that you were jail breaking your Pod, you put up a couple links to some decent PCs, a Gateway and an ASUS desktop
<Reikim> Alister: But that's the point. That can't happen. A government, by definition, has to meddle in the affairs of its citizens. It has to enforce rules. Without enforcement, all the rules go up in smoke.
<otakon> and he's GONE
<Pattyrick> I was looking at the ASUS and it looks pretty amazing
<Ponies47> Bye O.
<Alister> otakon: All the ''1%'' is doing is making profit. Individuals have a right to make money
<otakon> I think the chat derped
<Ponies47> 'DANG IT! :'(
<Pattyrick> Do you remember it at all?
<drfsupercenter> 03vaguely
<Pattyrick> I was going to ask, do you think that's worth getting?
<otakon> Alister: yeah, at the expense of everyone else with cutthroat business practices and special treatment from the government.
<Alister> Reikim: For that we need basic rules that protect us from Violence , Theft , Fraud and things as such. nothing more
<otakon> Alister: only in America could a place like Enron get away with what they did.
<Pattyrick> $1000 includes 16 GB of ram, 2 TB hard drive, Windows 7 included, 4 USB 3.0 ports, and more
<Alister> otakon: I'll have to google that
<Ascendant> Skylands
<drfsupercenter> 03that's...
<DerpyWhooves> Oh my god.
<Ascendant> one of my friends
<drfsupercenter> 03fairly overpriced for that tbh
<otakon> Alister:you NEVER heard of Enron?
<otakon> don't click that
<DerpyWhooves> I HATE TEAM FORTRESS 2.
<Ascendant> gave his dad 2 ubuntu cds, a debian one and one gparted one
<DerpyWhooves> goodbye.
<WallDives> wait, mfw theres a enron discussion in BronyState.
<Alister> Hold on I'm googling it
<Reikim> Alister: But that counts as infraction. If a government swears non-infraction, it stops being a government.
<otakon> hiya DerpyWhooves and bye...
<drfsupercenter> 03I can get you Windows 7 for free, 16GB of RAM costs like... $60? 2TB hard drive about $150
<Pattyrick> Hmmm
<Ascendant> when he came back to check them later, his dad had labelled them ALL ubuntu
<otakon> WallDives: it came up
<drfsupercenter> 03and most motherboards have USB 3.0 now
<otakon> I DO!
<WallDives> I havent heard about them since I was what, 12?

<drfsupercenter> 03and that's really easy to do so yeah
<Ponies47> MMMMMMM CAKE! *Drools*
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd just say to build your own honestly
<drfsupercenter> 03it'll be cheaper and you get good experience :P
<panda> CAKE!
<otakon> Alister: find it yet?
<panda> I LOVE CAKE!
<Alister> Reikim: By that I mean something has to impose security and justice , an objective force.
<Red_Pegasus> Sorry, the cake is a lie.
<Ponies47> *Keeps drooling*
<panda> I'D LIKE SOME POUND CAKE!
<otakon> I'DLIKESOMEPOUNDCAKE!
<otakon> XD
<panda> otakon: you got ninja'd
<Reikim> Alister: An objective force. Where does this objective force come from?
<Pattyrick> It comes with an i7 Ivy Bridge with up to 3.8 on Turbo Boost I think?

<Alister> Reikim: A police that SHOULD only make the non-infraction principle respected
<Skylands> 10Oh u
<drfsupercenter> 03<Pattyrick> It comes with an i7 Ivy Bridge with up to 3.8 on Turbo Boost I think? <- that's pretty good, I don't know anything about turbo boost though
<drfsupercenter> 03mine's an older i7
<drfsupercenter> 03before Sandy Bridge came out
<drfsupercenter> 03as SB was terrible :P
<Ascendant> turbo boost is pretty cool
<Ascendant> urgh SB
<drfsupercenter> 3CPU: Intel Core i7 960, 3.21 GHz, 0 KB (100% Load)
<otakon> Alister: so, you find out about Enron yet?
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Ascendant> I'm on linux mint atm
<drfsupercenter> 03I've heard Ivy Bridge was supposed to be good
<Alister> wait !
<Ponies47> *Falls to the floor and lands in puddle of drool*
<drfsupercenter> 03but I have no experience so I can't answer
<Ascendant> it's uses a sandybridge driver
<Ascendant> .-.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Randomnerd> Mmm cake.
<Pattyrick> Turbo Boost = I believe faster when multitasking with a hard load
*otakon mops up the drool and burns the mop.
<Reikim> Alister: Before we continue...a libertarian society is one in which a citizen is not allowed to limit another, yes?
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I'm lucky I got my stuff just before that
<Ascendant> drf
<Alister> Reikim: exactly
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah, that would make sense Pattyrick, but how is that different than overclocking :P
<Ascendant> my taskbar doesn't flash
<Pattyrick> Like hardcore gaming, lots of programs, etc.
<panda> Nittany_Discord: is playing too?
<Red_Pegasus> Chu guys talkin about
<Ascendant> because the stupid driver
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just controlled overclocking, really...
<Ascendant> doesn't work properly
<Reikim> Alister: How far do you plan on taking that?
<Ponies47> *Gets up* I'M COOL! I'M COOL! :D
<Randomnerd> Oh, lord, more politics?
<otakon> Red_Pegasus: governments
<Pattyrick> I see
<otakon> Randomnerd: not really
<drfsupercenter> 03my 3.2GHz can be easily overclocked to 3.6, probably 3.8
<drfsupercenter> 03but I really don't have any need to
<drfsupercenter> 03and no sense in possibly burning it out faster
<Polydunami> I'll be away for a few hours
<Alister> Reikim: What do you mean ? I wanr freedom for everyone that is simple
<panda> Poly|AFK|: alright :D
<Poly|AFK|> I will return
<Randomnerd> otakon: whew. would you believe I actually write for a small-times political blog? XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I tried to overclock my RAM and that sorta failed LOL
<Red_Pegasus> Goverments? Don't get Half life's Civil Protection evolved.
<otakon> Randomnerd: no I would not
<Shizuka> 13found wrek
<otakon> Shizuka: lol
<Pattyrick> I've heard that the i5s are the best processors for the money, but i7 is now good for gaming
<Reikim> Alister: But how far will that freedom extend? And then I could ask "what is freedom/does freedom exist" but I don't feel like going there tonight.
<drfsupercenter> 03u
<drfsupercenter> 03*um
<drfsupercenter> 03I wouldn't bother with i5.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not THAT much cheaper
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: :D
<Randomnerd> otakon: lol. I do, that's how I avoid talking politics elsewhere.
*DeathStar dances back into chat with some noodles
<otakon> Randomnerd: ah
<otakon> IT BURNS!
<Pattyrick> And i7 is getting g quite a bit better now
<otakon> Shizuka is best pyro
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: Dat shizu revenge! >:3
<otakon> lol
<otakon> BURN BABY BURN! DISCO INFERNO!
<panda> otakon: XD
<Ascendant> <drfsupercenter> I tried to overclock my RAM and that sorta failed LOL
<Alister> Reikim: All I'm saying is that as human beings we have a choice to make and responsibilities to make, When we agree on both , we should have the right to proceed
<Ascendant> looool overclocking RAM
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Alister> take*
<drfsupercenter> 03DDR3 is usually 1066MHz
<drfsupercenter> 03mine can do up to 1600 or 1866 or somethign
<Randomnerd> There are brave men at our door! Let's go out there and kill them!
<drfsupercenter> 03but you have to overclock it
<Reikim> Alister: You'll need to clarify that.
<Ascendant> $ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'model name' model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2670QM CPU @ 2.20GHz
<drfsupercenter> 03DDR2 did both 667 and 800 without overlcokcin,g it's a bit weird
<Ascendant> er
<drfsupercenter> 03*overclocking
<Ascendant> $ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'model name'
<Ascendant> model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2670QM CPU @ 2.20GHz
<otakon> Alister, Reikim please don't make it too crazy. I suggest taking that into PM for the time being.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL overcocking, that sounds fun
*drfsupercenter runs
<Ponies47> *Slides to the left*
<Pattyrick> drf, it's official: Not even I could attempt to afford a new Retina MacBook Pro LOL
<Reikim> PM? Ha. I have a room for that.
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ponies47> *Slides to the right*
<xmasskills> eat the sammich
<Pattyrick> Too many lols
<otakon> hiya xmasskills
<xmasskills> hi otakon
<Ponies47> Ohai xmasskills :)
<Ascendant> that's my CPU
<Ascendant> processor
<Alister> If the will of the majority was important that individual freedom. Then there would still be racist laws
<Reikim> Besides, at this point we usually end up seguing into philosophical maundering, and that's just fun.
<Alister> more*
<otakon> Reikim: ah

<FillyFlam> The only philosophy we need is ponies.
<kirz> 8,6<.<
<Pattyrick> Hy, oh u
<Ascendant> urgh
<Reikim> So anyway, although nitpicking at philosophical ideals is fun, it's more fun to muse on the fundamental nature of human existence.
<Ascendant> my driver is "Intel Sandybridge Mobile"
<Ascendant> -_-

<drfsupercenter> 03>CPU
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf?
<Shizuka> 13shizu with the defense
<drfsupercenter> 03usually only video cards and whatnot need drivers, CPUs juts work
<drfsupercenter> 03*just
<Ascendant> was unrelated
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yay, I got my new computer today :D
<drfsupercenter> 03weird
<Pattyrick> Yay, 4:11 in the morning
<Ascendant> I was talking about graphics driver
<panda> SuperBrony64: YES!
<drfsupercenter> 03it didn't need any of that for Windows, remember :P
<otakon> yay SuperBrony64 is it good?
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<Reikim> Question: How much freedom does a human being have a right to? Is such freedom good for the human race? For that matter, what is freedom? Is anyone truly free? And so on.
<drfsupercenter> 03EW ONBOARD GRAPHICS
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It awesome ^-^
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate the way new laptops are set up
<Ponies47> Ohai SuperBrony64. Lucky :(
<Ascendant> I dunno drf
<Ascendant> I'm on linux atm
<Iron_Edge> kirz: I thought you colorized that picture in the color of the Main 6?
<killerpony7733> Wrek: dat high tone :)
<drfsupercenter> 03where they have a split between onboard and dedicated
<panda> SuperBrony64: will it make you stream better?
*DeathStar dances on SuperBrony64 s new computer
<Reikim> Freedom is quite the loaded topic.
<drfsupercenter> 03my sister's is like that
<drfsupercenter> 03it's so stupid
<Iron_Edge> SuperBrony64: Woot woot
<otakon> indeed
<Ascendant> I don't think there's any drivers out for my video card
<drfsupercenter> 03my laptop has *only* a NVIDIA 160M
<otakon> but what about Domfree?
<Revolution08> can someone give me password to the server their playing on stream?
<Ponies47> I really need a new computer :(
<SuperBrony64> 11,02panda: Way better :3
<panda> SuperBrony64: YES NO MORE LAG!
<otakon> Revolution08: ask Shizuka or Wrek
<Ascendant> since I have an intel radeon 7960 or something
<Alister> I don't care if freedom will always be the best option. It's the only one for me
<Lunaughty> that was fun
<drfsupercenter> 03er, AMD
*SuperBrony64 picks up DeathStar and gives her a hug 'Hai ^-^ my computer lieks u :3'

<Lunaughty> Alister: oh really?
<otakon> DeathStar: well, you're popular today
<Ascendant> linux doesn't support my ATI atm
*DeathStar hugs SuperBrony64 back "yay ^^"
<Reikim> What is freedom?|
<Lunaughty> Alister: come with me to private chat
*panda glomps DeathStar
<Ascendant> And I don't want to bother writing drivers for it myself
<DeathStar> otakon: i know ^-^]
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> That was fun, thanks for the game guys :3
<Ascendant> because >effort
*DeathStar hugs panda

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep. That game sucked for me.
<xmasskills> i think everyone loves DeathStar
<panda> Shizuka: ill pm you
<Iron_Edge> Nittany_Discord: :D
<Prick> Shizuka...i got me eye on ya
<HyperMetalLugia> gpu support in general is crap
<Wrek> 05Shizuka: RoE?
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<Reikim> Freedom is an app that locks you off the Internet.
<DeathStar> O///O I'm sure not everyone loves me
<Shizuka> 13not tonight
<otakon> Prick: be careful, she'll poke it out on ya.
<Ascendant> yeah HML
<HyperMetalLugia> even with open source intel drivers LOL
<Wrek> 05k

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka complains about being bad, but she's twice as good as me.
<Ascendant> 'tis why you don't game on linux
<kirz> 8,6anyone up for some SC2?
<HyperMetalLugia> I don
*kirz pokes Midnight_Tempest
<Shizuka> 13i get lucky
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't plan to
<Reikim> Bah, nobody cares. That's okay, though.
<Ascendant> And which is why I have a windows partition
<HyperMetalLugia> though, emulators work
<Ascendant> so I can play games
<Ponies47> I wub DeathStar :)
<Ascendant> emulators?
<HyperMetalLugia> barely
<HyperMetalLugia> yeah
<Prick> i wanna get a pinkie pie wallpaper know any good ons?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You have a lot of luck.
<Ascendant> like?
<HyperMetalLugia> SNES/Genesis, DOSBOX
<OtakuTom> I have to fix my gaming desktop before I can play SC2 :(
<HyperMetalLugia> Mupen64Plus sucks
<HyperMetalLugia> Badly
<Capn_Gavn> i might Starcraft
<DeathStar> I wub you all too /)^3^(\
<panda> Shizuka doesnt always get lucky, but when she does, shes still better than Nittany_Discord XD
<Ascendant> Ah
<otakon> panda: lol
<Shamroc> DeathStar: wubs!
<Ascendant> N64 emulators work fine on linux
<Reikim> Pffft
<Ascendant> software manager has stuff
<HyperMetalLugia> well, it is configuring them which is a pain
<FillyFlam> Prick: Go on EQD and check the drawfriends. They have a lot of art that's surprisingly good for wallpapers.
<Ascendant> it's not that bad
<Reikim> It's way too late if I saw something naughty in Panda's statement.
<HyperMetalLugia> no GUI so :p
<Prick> kk
<Ascendant> XD
<Prick> i didnt know they have any
<panda> Reikim: O_O i cant look at Shizuka in THAT way... shes like... an older sister ^^ or something
<Capn_Gavn> eqd feature art is about 90% of my wallpaper folder
<HyperMetalLugia> 0hno
<HyperMetalLugia> battery at 7$
<panda> Shizuka: wait... that "not tonight" was that directed at me?
<FillyFlam> Prick: Oh they have a ton. They do a drawfriend every day and a wallpaper post semi-regularly.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts panda
<HyperMetalLugia> So anyways ascendant, this girl gave me her old craptop lenovo (she
<HyperMetalLugia> 's graduating)
<Reikim> panda: Personally, as much as I wub Shizuka, I am absolutely terrified of her.
<panda> Nittany_Discord: hehe you like dusting huh?
<HyperMetalLugia> and it has a stuck page down key
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes.
<HyperMetalLugia> as in, hardware stuck
<panda> Reikim: whats scary about her?
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<panda> Nittany_Discord: :) see i told you, im gonna keep ya in mah pocket XD
<Reikim> panda: I see you weren't here for the Doom3 stream.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't fit in people's pockets.
<panda> Reikim: yes i was... but it just makes me want to be near her for the impending zombie apocalypse
<Ponies47> Dang nice picture of Twilight. O_O
<panda> Nittany_Discord: :( even if they are big pockets?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No.
<Reikim> panda: If there's a zombie apocalypse, she'll probably send you to a better place using her shotgun.
<panda> Reikim: i dont think Shizuka will friendly fire me... im good with a sniper rifle :D
<panda> Nittany_Discord: :( maybe just on my shoulders then?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah, sure.
<Reikim> panda: We'll see...we could probably ask her during the Zombieland stream.
<Capn_Gavn> gavman2004
<panda> ^^
<panda> Reikim: alright
<Capn_Gavn> this isnt starcraft >:(
<panda> Nittany_Discord: hehe YAY! you could dust my cieling fans with that height XD

<Ascendant> or something
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf
<drfsupercenter> 03since when do laptops let you disable individual keys in the BIOS
<Ascendant> depends on your bios functionality
<panda> DeathStar: hm.... which pocket would be easier for you to get out of if i forget? XD
<Ascendant> technically it's possible
<Ascendant> but requires a lot of bios hacking and making the function yourself really
<panda> otakon: dang it! you and om! stop putting dust on me!

<Saturn> 08,01i'm oing to try and sleep again
<RyunosukeKnT> early 90's was bad for gaming
<Saturn> 08,01wake me up if the site's on fire
<Lambo> Eidos is like "Challenge accepted. It is so on."
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Right now is bad for gaming.
<Red_Pegasus> Wake up!
*RainbowJack pets Saturn
*RyunosukeKnT lites the sight on fire
<Reikim> Saturn: You do realize that otakon is on fire, yes? Okay then.
<otakon> Saturn: dude, WHY are curled around my dirty feet?

<Saturn> 08,01otakon: because you have cute toesies
<Red_Pegasus> Bye everypony.
<RyunosukeKnT> that is true too Nittany_Discord, but the early 90's wasnt much better ;)
<Reikim> otakon: Also they're on fire. Sunfire, to be specific.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: this is hilarious and that tomb raider 7
<RainbowJack> Bye Red_Pegasus

<BroKnee> Somepony plz tell me how I can get a Rainbowdash on my screen like that ._.
<RainbowJack> i love RDs face when shes picked up by her tail
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did the 90s have businessmen ruin it?
<Saturn> 08,01BroKnee: sacrifice a filly to the alter of celestia
<RyunosukeKnT> "a woman's got to do, what a woman's got to do, PERIOD"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hell, even E3 isn't for gamers anymore.
<RainbowJack> yeah kind of
<panda> BroKnee: its called desktop ponies :) download it :)
<RyunosukeKnT> Nittany_Discord: kinda
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I guess we're repeating the 90s.
<Saturn> 08,01BroKnee: but seriously, it's called Desktop Ponies
<BroKnee> Saturn I did that last tuesday for a Lolipop
<Saturn> 08,01google it

<otakon> BRING BACK THE 80'S!
<Jspang1> i just went to the browser ponies website... i think im gonna be here a while
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Great games, but won't buy them because the companies don't know when enough is enough when it comes to selling you things.
<Reikim> Saturn: I think there was a typo there. You clearly meant the altar of Molestia. Molestia likes the fillies; Celestia prefers crops, fruit, harvest-y things like that.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or trying to fight piracy.
*DeathStar dances
<Jspang1> is the stream black for anyone else?

<Jspang1> my screen is literally full of ponies and i LOVE IT
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Saturn: about what?

<Reikim> Saturn: Damn, that's not good. Those are the worst bones to break, because it's literally impossible not to move it. Take some more painkillers and feel better.
<Saturn> 08,01Big_Macintosh_1992: bitch please, im 25 and moveed back in with my parents
*DeathStar kisses Saturn foot better
<BroKnee> I love desktop ponies already ._.
<RainbowJack> Nittany_Discord : when do you get your Shotgun or portal gun?
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Saturn: i have a feeling i'll be in that boat too
<otakon> RainbowJack: wrong game, plus no Steve
<Jspang1> what is the idea of this game? why are people trying to hurt you?
<RainbowJack> lol
<Jspang1> I thought everyone was against jigsaw
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Saturn: but do you live with your @hole stepdad?
<RainbowJack> i was just kidding
<Saturn> 08,01and my mother is from india, which mAKES some issues... interesting

<RainbowJack> oohhh thats Shocking\
<Big_Macintosh_1992> twilight_sprinkle: you beat me
<otakon> Jspang1: it's SAW, they think the only way to survice is to kill your ass when really if everyone co-operated you'd survive
<Jspang1> twilight_sprinkle: well duh... i think halflife 2 is scarier than this
<otakon> HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG!?
<Jspang1> otakon: lol
<twilight_sprinkle> Jspang1: yeah i agree
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: dude you're echoing too

<Jspang1> twilight_sprinkle: i about shit myself at the first fast zombie
<otakon> Jspang1: oh god, the dogs in Resident Evil did that to me... I HATE THOSE GODDAMN DOGS.
<twilight_sprinkle> Jspang1: lol i stopped playing after the headcrab in the water pipes outside the city jumped me. i was especially scared because i played that level before and it didnt happen
<RainbowJack> Jspang1 you need to play Deadisland
<Jspang1> otakon: i never played resident evil
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This mic sucks and I can tell by the crap quality.
<otakon> Jspang1: you should, it's a classic even if the controls suck and it's hard as hell
<Jspang1> RainbowJack: i almost bought that, but then I got borderlands
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: plus you're echoing
<otakon> Jspang1: Borderlands is good
<Jspang1> otakon: i played about five seconds of RE5
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01otakon: I can't help it.
<Jspang1> otakon: does that count>
<Jspang1> ?*
<otakon> Jspang1: completely different game style so no.
<RainbowJack> Nittany_Discord: your mic is kinda going to die soon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Need to fix VAC somehow.
<Jspang1> otakon::'(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Funny since the mic is relatively new.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: call upon the Techponies
<sonicrainboomer259> tru
<BroKnee> How do I make it so I can see my desktop ponies while playing games? :s
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It could be my mic or my sound card.
<otakon> BroKnee: play in windowed mode
<Reikim> BroKnee: You have to make your game windowed, and then set the ponies to not go in that area.
<Airpuff> Yahooz: if you were planning on /ignoreing me without even trying to elaborate from the start, i see absolutely no reason to mention it for me at all.
<Jspang1> we still love you Nittany_Discord
<BroKnee> I want them on my game screen wile I play :3
*RainbowJack hugs Nittany_Discord
<Jspang1> BroKnee: i could never play like that

<otakon> Yahooz: what did you do to Airpuff?

<otakon> Jspang1: Dragon's Dogma gets VERY dark but only at night.

<twilight_sprinkle> this games needs more music variety
<twilight_sprinkle> *game
<Jspang1> otakon: which mine used to be
<|Discord|> FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Jspang1> otakon: zombies on cod was really bad too
<Jspang1> is hrenia supposed to be hernia?
<otakon> Jspang1: yeah but with Dragon's Dogma its a design choice for night to be dark to inspire fear while traveling at night. You know, a sense of danger and uncertainty basically
<Jspang1> otakon: right
<otakon> |Discord|: what's wrong?
<twilight_sprinkle> 1050 points for schizophrenia gah how do you even spell it
<Jspang1> twilight_sprinkle: i think you got it perfectly

<Sumica> 00,10alright, lets try the "full" version of KSP
<twilight_sprinkle> ah
<otakon> Sumica: KSP?
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: the spaceship thing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It crashes frequently when I run certain games.
<Sumica> 00,10Kerbal space program
<RainbowJack> superretroworld : Jigsaw needs to watch MLP
<panda> ^
<Sumica> 00,10ohhh a new building on the space complex
<Nittany_Discord> 11,011000 RDs didn't crash my computer though.
<superretroworld> RainbowJack: i mean whos jigsaw?
<Vordox> "So I heard you didn't like ponies....you need to love My Ltitle Pony or you will die. your choice."
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord 1000?? wow, i need to try that
<RainbowJack> from the game that was streamed
<Jspang1> RainbowJack: then he would kidnap haters and force them to watch the show, we would be one step closer to world domination
<Nittany_Discord> 11,011000 ground it to a halt, though.
<Jspang1> also what Vordox said
<RainbowJack> Jspang1 : thats what i ment
<twilight_sprinkle> i only did 223 ponies
<twilight_sprinkle> didnt crash but got laggy
<hen3ry> Make it to the Mun safely yet, Sumi?
<Jspang1> RainbowJack: to quote Big Mac, eeeeeyup
<cow334> Nittany_Discord: Where do you go to get the ponys on the screen or is it something for bronystate members only?
<Sumica> 00,10you had to add in safly did't you
<Reikim> Cheapest, most painless way to drive yourself insane? Sit yourself down in a room, and play a 20kHz frequency through it. Stay there for a number of hours.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01cow334: Desktop ponies.
<hen3ry> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> cow334: lol its a program, called desktop ponies
<Jspang1> cow334: google browser ponies
<Jspang1> or desktop
<Sumica> 00,10looks like I will have to show you all the game when nitt is done.
<cow334> And what dose it do dose it caost moeny
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've made it to the Mun, but I haven't landed yet.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I keep crashing.
<cow334> cost
<otakon> Reikim: are you MAD!? Goddammit man that would kill me
<hen3ry> I just barely missed my last attempt. I think this time I'm gonna get it. Landing is hard tho
<Jspang1> cow334: not that i know of, i think you just have to download it
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: the Mun?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The only ship that I can get to the moon each time has a descent engine that's too powerful.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's the Moon in KSP.
<otakon> oh
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: the games way of spelling moon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's goes by Mun.
<otakon> that weird game
<cow334> Jspang1: oh okay then im going to get on it whoohoo
<otakon> so is Luna than Luma?
<Jspang1> otakon: obviously, shes Lona
<hen3ry> You have to use the weaker liquid engine I think. It has vectoring, so it gives you better control than using the side thrusters. But it's weaker.
<twilight_sprinkle> she is Loona
<Jspang1> ^
<RainbowJack> to the MUUUUUUNNNNN!!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: Luna and Moon switched u for oo
<hen3ry> Only for the moon-lander stage, tho.
<sonicrainboomer259> the stream is buffering
<otakon> sonicrainboomer259: he crashed give him time
<Jspang1> buffering is a dirty word
<DeathStar> Nittany_Discord: that's no moon <.< >.>
<otakon> DeathStar: oh har har :P
<Jspang1> DeathStar: isee what you did there
<sonicrainboomer259> that sucks :/
<twilight_sprinkle> Jspang1: that reminds me of unintentional math humor by my lecturer. ''The function U is an ugly function"

<otakon> Jspang1: well don't go. I had a friend he went there frequently, we saw some amazing things and some TERRIBLE HORRIBLE GOD WHY DID THEY EVEN things...
<MysticLugia> 12doh!
*Jspang1 laughs at Om's discombobulation
<otakon> wb Om
<MysticLugia> 12>.<
<Jspang1> otakon: you found something amazing on a site like that?
<Reikim> otakon: Chat roulette: like Russian Roulette, only the scars are a lot more permanent.
<Jspang1> otakon: my curiosity, ithas been piqued
<Jspang1> its a word look it up
<otakon> Jspang1: well, three pretty girls frolicking topless on the screen I consider a nice treat. I'll not describe the horrible...
<Jspang1> Reikim: this
<Reikim> otakon: Well then! That is QUITE the treat.
<Jspang1> otakon: its not like i dont know whats there, ive just never been
<Jspang1> otakon: my heart goes out to you bro
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: whats more permanent than death
*DuskStarshimmer turns my swag on
<Jspang1> otakon: i intend to send a big bottle of brain bleach your way asap
<Chimera> Sheeny
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: See, if you're dead, you don't GET scars. This is the joke.
<Chimera> Y u remove me from call
<BroKnee> I seriously frigin LOVE desktop ponies xD
<Chimera> ;w;
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<DeathStar> twilight_sprinkle: permanent marker I would know
*Chimera huga in sadness
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Am I streaming?
<Jspang1> twilight_sprinkle: half the things you see on chat roulette
<Chimera> *hugs
<otakon> Jspang1: yeah, the way my living room was set up the PC was in the living room and you could see what the person on the PC was doing as they were next to the sofa. I've forgotten what else happened on chat roulette, blocked it out see?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nvm
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: you get scars and they dont heal because youre dead
*Jspang1 high fives otakon
<the_real_pony_1604> got nothing Nittany
<SheenaFox> oh
<Ponies47> ^
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Scars are healed wounds. No heal, no scars. Dead = no heal. Therefore death = no scars.
<SheenaFox> That's because people get tons of spam from us
<otakon> my flash crashed AGAIN
<Jspang1> otakon: HORRAY FOR BRAIN BLEACH
<Chimera> Lol
<SheenaFox> cuz there's like nine people and tons of messages
<Chimera> Mmm
<Jspang1> thanks prince-lemon
<Reikim> YES THANK YOU SIR LEMON
<otakon> Jspang1: I didn't get any from ya, my flash crashed. second time that's happened since I updated
<drfsupercenter> 03wait,w hat call, people were on skype?
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: scars are wounds that werent fully healed, so you could argue that if youre dead and an injury doesnt heal, its a scar
<Chimera> Can I be re-added tomorrow?
<Reikim> Great knight of the Citrus realms.
<SheenaFox> sure? lol
<Chimera> Yes...
<Ponies47> Dat prince-lemon! :)
<RainbowJack> WOW i want that clock
<otakon> brb guys, apparently firefox has a update
<Chimera> Thanks btw xP
<Jspang1> otakon: goddammit, i think its a problem on my end
<Jspang1> otakon: givve me a second
<Ponies47> Is the stream work? :(
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Healing process is necessary for a scar. Also, I'm pretty sure an open bleeding wound isn't a scar, it's an open, bleeding wound. Studied first aid, you see.
<superretroworld> prince-lemon: that'll be a cool old fashion thing to get
<otakon> and Nittany_Discord we got no stream atm
<Ponies47> ^
<Reikim> Emissary of EQD
<otakon> superretroworld: that's a bot atm I think "lemon" aka dari is asleep atm
<Reikim> And stuff
<otakon> STREAMCEPTION!
<Jspang1> WE HAVE STREAM
<Jspang1> aort of

<RainbowJack> yay its back
<Ponies47> THERE IT IS! :)
<panda> dat yay
<RainbowJack> aahh that YAY
<sonicrainboomer259> finally
<superretroworld> otakon: so somebody else does it for him or it automacially updates itself?
<Om> panda: Yay?
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: itll stop bleeding, like a scar stops bleeding. the fact that a scar is something that hasnt fully healed you could say that a death injruy is also a scar
<RainbowJack> Nittany_Discord do the YAY agian
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: No scar tissue.
<Sumica> 00,10I have no clue how to make a space plane
<RainbowJack> AGIAN!!!
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Now to get technical. A scar is a formation of scar tissue.
<RainbowJack> LOUDER!!!
<Jspang1> Nittany_Discord: would you mind turning down your game volume a little bit?
<valoreins> hello everypony
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: No healing process, no buildup of scar tissue, which usually only begins after the copious bleeding has stopped.
<DeathStar> hi valoreins
<superretroworld> hey valoreins
*Jspang1 hugs valoreins
<valoreins> :$
<Ponies47> Ohai valoreins :)
<Om> hiya valoreins, whos name looks like calories
<valoreins> :s
<sonicrainboomer259> T_T
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: you shouldve started with that :3
<Jspang1> jjfjjfjjfjjfjjfjjfjjfjjfjjfjjfjjfjjfjjfjf
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Also, a scar is technically a healed injury.

*RainbowJack Brohoofs back
<otakon> WHO TRIED TO LOG IN AS ME?
<DeathStar> Ponies47: /)
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: It's not perfectly healed, but it's still healed, as in it's no longer bleeding everywhere and probably isn't an immediate danger to your health, unless it's on your heart, in which case you're screwed.
<superretroworld> *(\
<Ponies47> HUZZAH! FOR BROHOOFS! :p
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: you have steal hooves :D
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: I think the ponies are causing you framerate issues

<superretroworld> WE NEED MORE COWBELL
<Reikim> The night has grown long, my friends. Alas, though I would much enjoy remaining here yet a while longer, I must part for now. Good night, my little ponies; let not the night terrors sink their terrible claws into your hearts, but allow Celestia's warm radiance to fill your souls and Luna's gentle luminescence guide you through the dream realms.
<twilight_sprinkle> tl;dr
<Chimera> Don't they look like dirt/rocks with crab appendages?

<Jspang1> can you poni poni with poni and poni
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: 1001 ponies on screen... that would cause some corruption

<Saturn> 08,01Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that some bees have acquired the ability to fire their stingers: http://media.sacbee.com/smedia/2012/06/13/20/18/10HAIG.Xl.4.jpeg
<twilight_sprinkle> Jspang1: :D
<sonicrainboomer259> hen3ry: he better.......
<Sylandest> Saturn: sweet merciful celestia, thats a spooky thought
<Om> Saturn: e__e
<CupcakeWarrior> Saturn: Why do you like bees so much?
<Saturn> 08,01CupcakeWarrior: because they're both interesting and adorable
<Polydunami> OR the stinger is being ripped out from the bee :S
<Jspang1> twilight_sprinkle: i guess thats a reason to love adam west, he gave us great catch phrases
<Ponies47> Saturn: WHY YOULD YOU POST THAT!?! :'(
<twilight_sprinkle> so bees are like nightmare frames of the holy britannian empire
<Om> CupcakeWarrior: he is a bee keeper as well I do belive?
<Ponies47> BEE'S SCARE ME! :'(
<Saturn> 08,01don't worry, i'm only kidding; they can't really fire their stingers
<Saturn> 08,01Ponies47: don't click the link, then
<Ponies47> Saturn: I didn't :)
<Saturn> 08,01then stop complaining
<cow334> Saturn: If bee were able to fire there stingers that would suck cause what is the point in running if they can just fire at will it will be like *haha take that bee but then all of a sudden BAM <-- to the knee that would suck but then agian that would be pretty cool
<CupcakeWarrior> I love bees :D
<Jspang1> Ponies47: i used to be freakinghorrified of bees
<Ponies47> Uh the memory it's vome back! mom MOMMY! *Curls up into aball and starts sucking on hoof*
<Ponies47> *coming
<Om> Ninjazz: HEY UUU
<Ninjazz> Om, WHOOO MEEE?!
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh, hey Ninjazz, didn't see you there :D
<Saturn> 08,01bee stings aren't all that bad once you've been stung a couple of times
<Lewis_Jenkins> Ah, is this that Saw game?
<Ninjazz> Hey, CW. :)
<Om> Ninjazz: YEAH UUU
<Saturn> 08,01i generally don't use gloves when tending hives
<Jspang1> Ponies47: my brother stepped on a bee once, i got a free capri sun while he got his bee sting treated

<Jspang1> Ponies47: fucks given: 0
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: I have no idea where this came from :$

<Saturn> 08,01it's okay, Sylandest can be my hubby
<BroKnee> Does anyone know a REALLY scary horror game that you CANT die in? xD My sister and I are going to have a competition :3
<Jspang1> Ponies47: no i was talking about my brother

<Saturn> 08,01we can get married on calton hill in edinburgh
<Saturn> 08,01it'll be magical
<Ponies47> Jspang1: Oh. Sorry :$

<Cobellanez> Death is a mjor component of a horror game
<Sylandest> Saturn: wh-wha? bu-but-but...I...how...
<Ninjazz> Sylandest, O__O
<Ponies47> Jspang1: IT'S ALRIGHT! :D

<Ponies47> *Grabs Ninjazz* WHERE ARE YOU GOING!?!
<Vordox> Oh yeah Saturn doesn't have a DP do you? D:
<cow334> Saturn: Actually I think no one should be afraid of bee's like they wont sting you if you dont mess with them I have been by some bee's before and they wernt messing with me cause I did nothing to them
<Sylandest> Saturn: but dave's not my name...:$
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: i beg your pardon?
<Vordox> Ah err....nothing. :P
<Om> Ninjazz: No, now get back here.
<Ponies47> *Noms on popcorn*
<Saturn> 08,01cow334: i regularly stick my hands into beehives, and can confirm this
<Jspang1> o yeah, Nittany_Discord is still trying to figure this thing out
<Saturn> 08,01though sometimes, bees can get aggressive
<Saturn> 08,01there are times i've been down to my hive and thehy're doing that high pitched buzzing thing
<Ninjazz> Om, I'm busy. Hang on.
<Om> Ninjazz: Fair enough
<Lewis_Jenkins> :o
<cow334> Saturn: yup wait you stick your hand in a bee hive before
<Saturn> 08,01so it's just like "okay, girls, i'll leave you alone 'til tomorrow"

<Saturn> 08,01Ponies47: i'm just imagining a bee mugging you
<Saturn> 08,01it's hilarious
<Lewis_Jenkins> I only don't like wasps. Bees are alright if you don't anger them.
<Sylandest> Om: I'm not getting married! XD
<Saturn> 08,01Om: no, we're going to have a Betazoid wedding
<Jspang1> Ponies47: i think wasps are worse because at least bees only got one sting in them wasps will fuck your shit up
<Saturn> 08,01everyone in attendance will be naked
<Saturn> 08,01it'll be the best thing ever
<Om> Saturn: Ohh, that sounds fun
<Ponies47> Saturn: Dat's not nice. :(
<Sylandest> Saturn: O///O
<Ninjazz> :c
<CupcakeWarrior> Saturn: Not sure if I want to see you naked or not :S
<Saturn> 08,01Ponies47: i disagree

<Jspang1> Ponies47: im sad to say that if i have any kind of bug on me, stinging or no, i will swat at them and dance like a retarded chimp while screaming like a little girl
<Polydunami> I want to see that xD
<Sylandest> Saturn: I don't want holes in my legs and body!
<sonicrainboomer259> you did it Nittany_Discord!!!
<hen3ry> why do you say that, Sumi?
<Ponies47> Jspang1: It's ok. :)
<Saturn> 08,01Jspang1: even butterflies?
<Jspang1> Nittany_Discord: didnt you already have a nail bat?
<Saturn> 08,01Sylandest: what about a sexy little crown?
<Sumica> 00,10cause in .15 I have all kinds of new parts to play with
<hen3ry> ahh
<Om> Sylandest: Sexy crowns are nice
<Sylandest> Saturn: well...a crown would be nice...:3
<Lewis_Jenkins> If I were playing the game on the stream, I'd have thrown my computer out of the window by now.
<Jspang1> Saturn: no, not flies either, but pretty much everything else
<Sylandest> Om: that would be a nice benefit...:D
*Jspang1 sighs
<cow334> Saturn: having a sexy crown would be boss
<Ponies47> My history with bee's I don't wanna talk about it :S
<Saturn> 08,01Lewis_Jenkins: luckily, you're not

<Lewis_Jenkins> I'm just going to casually tell my mum I watch my little pony some time. :3
<Ponies47> Jspang1: I let mom catch me. She's fine with it. My dad I'm not so sure about it :S
<Saturn> 08,01meh

<Sylandest> Saturn: what is it, satty? :3
<Saturn> 08,01that's waaay too much to spend on a shirt
<Jspang1> i just realized something... i said i was going to pee ten minutes ago

<Ponies47> Saturn: Dat shirt looks cool. Not so sure what dad would think if he saw me wearin that :$
<DeathStar> Saturn: that's an understatement
<CupcakeWarrior> Hey DeathStar :D
<Jspang1> Saturn: thats just because im not comfortable with people knowing im a brony. highschoolers can be viscious
<Lewis_Jenkins> I'm sure this library will be a fun place to read and learn.
<DeathStar> hi CupcakeWarrior
<Saturn> 08,01Jspang1: true

<Polydunami> So that's viscous or vicious?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm a functional programming fan
<Sylandest> Polydunami: i believe viscious

<sonicrainboomer259> KANEDAAAAA!!!!!!!!!
<SolairePony89> MFW RollerCoaster Tycoon was published by Hasbro Interactive.

<hen3ry> need another three astronauts, I'm afraid
<sonicrainboomer259> anybody have Minecraft on Xbox 360??????
<SolairePony89> In otherwords, I loved Hasbro before it was cool :
