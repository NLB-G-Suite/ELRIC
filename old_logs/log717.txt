<Flyboy> maybe it runs in the family...?
<Rev> They went in dry
<mutterguy_> actually #15 seems about right
<RainbowAsh> Well... it's an interesting choice. Could probably get used to it after a while
<Flyboy> wut...
<Flyboy> no...
<Sumica> 00,10not bad number 10
<Jmo> Oh
<Jmo> damn
<Jmo> Adam isn't on

<pot80_GLaDos> MadSurge: about the same for me XD I've got a parent free day an' I aint gonnah waste it!
<Flyboy> well yeah, it aint too bad
<RainbowAsh> 10 is fine so far

<Sumica> 00,10dat rarityrage
<RainbowAsh> 9 seems ok, too.
<Sumica> 00,10nope
<Sumica> 00,10nope nope nope
<Dark_Horst> ...for some reason i expected a gruff manly voice
<Flyboy> not to bad... i guess...
<MadSurge> pot80_GLaDos: Awww yeah, party hard! :$
<Dark_Horst> i'm probably lsitening to norwegian metal too much
<RainbowAsh> 8 is ok, too. The voice is strange, but at least it can hold a tone

<Sumica> 00,10pinkiebot
<Gold_Demona> I understand where they made the error in translation, but that's hilarious. XD
<Dark_Horst> is that an electronic voice?
<Gold_Demona> dat autotune
<naturesfury> this ones ok
<MadSurge> Autotune~
<Gold_Demona> HEAVY on the autotune
<Gold_Demona> At least they tried to keep her on pitch. XD
<RainbowAsh> Probably they didn't have any choice
<Dark_Horst> sounds entirely artificial, so much autotune is in there
<Rev> Eeeew, Autotune
<Gold_Demona> I'd rather have autotune than painfully off pitch singing
<Dark_Horst> ...why did they do that?
<JRP2234> Phase4
<Dark_Horst> why do they speak different laguages?
<MadSurge> If the VA can't sing just hire someone else to do that!
<Gold_Demona> Dark_Horst: She was probably painfully off pitch.
<Phase4> JRP2234
<RainbowAsh> Dark_Horst, probably they recorded the voices seperately and mixed the wrong ones together
<Kurra> o.o
<prince-dari> You have to understand that the other languages have much less money to play with
<Serenity> 2 B CONTINUOO
<Gold_Demona> What if you can't afford to hire a singer?
<Flyboy> Phase4! i meant to ask, do you still play on magicka?
<MadSurge> Dat manly voice
<HavokOC|AFK> xD
<MadSurge> :D
<RainbowAsh> Gold_Demona, don't accept a contract to dub a show with lots of singing in it.
<Dark_Horst> some of them spund like the daily wage was a coke and half a banana
<Serenity> I thought portugese RD was male?

<Serenity> 'her laugh sounds like Mandarks but not rhythmed like his
<HavokOC|AFK> xD

<Flyboy> couldnt be bothered to dub XD
<Starchaser> wow great singer
<Dark_Horst> i didnt know i could understand turkish until today
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: our dub is too good, they're latching on secondary character voices :D
<Serenity> Dark_Horst: Same
<RainbowAsh> Flyboy, better give up than do a shoddy job
<Starchaser> its like they got the origanal voice

<MadSurge> Hey hey, Italy has Beauty Marks too. But no word on that?!
<JRP2234> mica <<< it reminds me of roman saying Nikko
<Dark_Horst> schönheitsfleck >literal translation > beauty mark
<Gold_Demona> LOL I understand the error in translation with the "apple foot"
<JRP2234> Phase4 10th 16th
<Gold_Demona> The spanish word for foot is spelled PIE
<RainbowAsh> Dark_Horst, what would be the right translation for cutie mark?
<Dark_Horst> we dont have a specific word for "cutiemark"
<JRP2234> Phase4 10th - 16th*

<naturesfury> i wonder what applejack sounds like
<HavokOC> OH MAI
<RainbowAsh> Cataclysm
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I haven't studied any French. Any French I pick up is anything that's similar to Spanish. :P
<Sumica> 00,10love that trick with the hourglass
<Kurra> nmm
<Sumica> 00,10I totaly missed it the first time
<HavokOC> wait, missed it T.T
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: WHich isn't nearly as much as there is in Italian
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: same here
<Kaidrin> Are the opening sequences dubbed as well?
<RainbowAsh> Twilight's home in Canterlot is pretty awesome
<JunkerKun> Now I only wish I could understand what they're saying...
<HavokOC> FUS ROH DAH?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: true, french is complicated even for other neolatin speakers
<Kaidrin> that sound effect!
<RainbowAsh> JunkerKun, you don't know the episodes by heart?
<Dark_Horst> i'm pretty sure thats not her home7
<Dark_Horst> just the library
<JunkerKun> RainbowAsh: I didn't watch first two episodes too much actually
<Sumica> 00,10yes Kaidrin
<HavokOC> did i hear monsieur twillight?
<HavokOC> T.T
<Flyboy> HavokOC: ikr
<MadSurge> HavokOC: MA CHERE Twilight
<JunkerKun> "Make some friends!"
<Kurra> i like french version a lot
<RainbowAsh> Dark_Horst, it doesn't look large enough to be the city library and we know that the royal library is not in a tower
<Sumica> 00,10here comes fancy pinkie
<HavokOC> berry
<HavokOC> oh god
<Kaidrin> why is sumerica highlighted?
<Nyst> poneh!
<Dark_Horst> could be either pivate library
<Dark_Horst> or cintinuity error
<HavokOC> Sumi is Mod
<naturesfury> she moderator
<HavokOC> Mods can has color
<MadSurge> GAAAAAASSP
<HavokOC> *have
<JRP2234> mica nice lip sync
<RainbowAsh> Wow, that Pinkie scream
<Kaidrin> Oh, figures.
<Nyst> Is the image a little stretched?
<HavokOC> sumi dance
<MadSurge> Nyst: a little?!
<RainbowAsh> Nyst, that's how they broadcast in france
<Kaidrin> poor france.
<HavokOC> dat laugh
<HavokOC> *giggle
<Nyst> But, Pinkie isn't suppsed to scream, she should gasp.
<Flyboy> i may have done french, but i cant understand a word of this..
<Kaidrin> What happens when the "my sister's speakin' fancy!" part comes up?
<Nyst> Le diner est prêt
<HavokOC> macintosh
<Flyboy> i only know what theyre saying becuase of so many replays of season 1
<HavokOC> I deffinately heard macintosh
<naturesfury> its a name
<Kurra> Kaidrin, mah sister's speakin'.... country?
<Sumica> 00,10or madam le flour
<RainbowAsh> Kaidrin, maybe she will switch dialects?
<Nyst> I understand it fine and I haven't spoken french in years.
<Kaidrin> XD
<MadSurge> ^
<XAX> roseluck is a pretty pone http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1351741518841.gif
<naturesfury> names nouens* stay the same in other languages
<Nyst> It helps that I know the dialogue by heart.
<Flyboy> Sumica: you MUST find us 'party of one' YOU MUST
<Kaidrin> Yes!
<Kaidrin> why
<Nyst> I wonder how many of the foreign voice actors knew what they were getting into.
<JunkerKun> Me-Gusta? O_O
<HavokOC> dat voice
<MadSurge> Nyst: I don't but I can still understand it fine if spoken at this speed.
<RainbowAsh> I like French RD
<Nyst> They probably thought it was just another kiddie toon.
<Kaidrin> why
<Flyboy> the SFX are so f*cking loud!
<MadSurge> Italian RD is Dexter btw :D
<Dark_Horst> Nyst: they probably got into nothing since the only ones we give a shit abput are the original ones :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: LOL That's awesome. :D
<JRP2234> they sound like pedo
<JRP2234> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Flyboy> LE WONDARBOLT!
<Kurra> LE WANNDERBALLT
<Nyst> Dark_Horst: is that why you think some of the translations are so awful?
<Kaidrin> Discord!?
<RainbowAsh> Dark_Horst, didn't some of the European cons invite some of the dub speakers? I think that sexy sounding spitfire va in particular
<Kaidrin> Again!!?
<JRP2234> llllllllllllllllll
<Dark_Horst> Nyst: naw. i think they're so bad bacause budget. or the translating companies didnt give a shit. mostly both
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also Fluttershy and Applejack have the same VA and they sound nothing alike :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Awesome :D
<Dark_Horst> RainbowAsh: actually, i have no idea
<Nyst> It doesn't help that some countries only have like...five voice actors total.
<RainbowAsh> I wonder what Turkey made out of that?
<RainbowAsh> Or does turkish spike like big buts?
<Kandarihu|Zoro> It's probably the reason why most Japanese don't care about the translation quality of English dubs.
<Dark_Horst> lost count of all these cons
<Kandarihu|Zoro> ...and then they try to use said dubs in order to learn English.
<Nyst> I know over here, literally every cartoon is voiced by the same small group of people.
<JunkerKun> Dark_Horst: Nah, they just what we call "Надмозг", literally meaning "Overmind" which is a meme. It means very VERY bad translation often using automated translation programms
<HavokOC> And that was the day spike learned to fly
<JRP2234> mica do you like fps games from the 90's?
<Kaidrin> with his invisible dragon wings
<Nyst> Translating into Japanese is really tricky since a literal translation is all but impossible.
<Sumica> 00,10meh
<Dark_Horst> perfect timing
<MadSurge> Fancy Rarity is still fabulous
<JunkerKun> Nyst: Literal translation if often worse than adaptation, no?
<JunkerKun> *is
<Kandarihu|Zoro> Nyst, indeed. It takes more context than the writers of most American media are known to muster.
<Nyst> You need to keep the original intent and tone of the script, translated into a regional and/or social equivalent
<Nyst> And that is -hard-
<JRP2234> it seems THEY ALL SOUND THE SAME
<Kaidrin> I'm... ok with this
<Gold_Demona> Fluttershy's still Dawwable. :3
<Nyst> JunkerKun: Literal translation is often just funny.
<MadSurge> :D
<Kaidrin> ^w^
<HavokOC> dat hair cam
<Kaidrin> -_-
<JunkerKun> Nyst: Yep. We have "Twilight Sparkle" and "Полуночная Искорка". And at the same time we have "Rainbow Dash" and "Радужная Дэш" with "Дэш" being transliteration. I mean, WTF?
<Kaidrin> did spike just say "Oh F***
<RainbowAsh> Nyst, don't forget it also needs to be about the same length and it looks strange when you can't match the sentence structure it looks strange when the expressions change at the wrong point.
<Nyst> I don't read russian; can you give a literal translation of those words?
<RainbowAsh> And now Fluttershy knows the rest of the backstory.
<HavokOC> SURPRISE
<Kaidrin> Yeah Twilight! Tell him.
<Nyst> RainbowAsh: that's why some people swear with subs and nothing else.
<HavokOC> ohgodfrenchpinkie
<Kaidrin> ^
<Sumica> 00,10it works
<JunkerKun> Nyst: "Полуночная Искорка" is literal translation of "Twilight Sparkle" and "Радужная Дэш" is a bullshit. Because "Радужная" is literal translation and "Дэш" is just "Dash" spoken in Russian
<Dark_Horst> Nyst: actually, you dont read cyrillic
<MadSurge> RainbowAsh: they had to resort to call Celestia with her full english title in italian because of lip sync
<HavokOC> Sumi, the gif. do you make it dance manually or is it just part of the gif?
<Kaidrin> It's like a stereotypical mexican sports announcer pinkie!
<Nyst> Oh, so it's like how it'd be 'ranbowu daishu' in Japanese?
<Sumica> 00,10it's part of the animations
<MadSurge> HavokOC: it's Desktop Ponies!
<JunkerKun> Nyst: Kind of
<HavokOC> Oh, okay
<Nyst> That's kinda funny.
<Kaidrin> Desktop Ponies?
<Sumica> 00,10has 4 animations that it picks from at random
<RainbowAsh> Nyst, I prefer subs too whenever I get the chance. The choice of VA's is quite important in my opinion.
<HavokOC> Then it's just timing when it dances when music is on lol
<MadSurge> Nenenenenenene
<Sumica> 00,10google it Kaidrin
<Kaidrin> Good point.
<JunkerKun> Nyst: Especially when all other names are literal translations...
<JunkerKun> Nyst: I still wait for second season dub to hear what else they can come up with
<Kurra> transliterations
<HavokOC> Huzzah, luna
<RainbowAsh> MadSurge, Equestria is best British Empire
<Nyst> Junkerkun; what would you have done? Kept all the names in english?
<MadSurge> RainbowAsh: :D
<Dark_Horst> Nyst: of course. they're names
<Dark_Horst> names need no translation
<RainbowAsh> I love what they did with the Major's voice
<Nyst> That's a good point.
<MadSurge> Nyst: italian did that :D
<Kurra> has anyone seen my gloves?
<Dark_Horst> germy too
<Dark_Horst> *germany
<JunkerKun> Nyst: Either make adaptation or keep english names. Mixing both is just no good
<Nyst> Pony names are already weird in that way, in that they're also words.
<MadSurge> LEGASP
<Dark_Horst> wow. my typing sucks today
<Kaidrin> I love those things XD
<RainbowAsh> Dark_Horst, I think I will call it germy from now on. ;)#
<Kaidrin> Pinkie gasp is best
*Jmo pokes Gold_Demona
<Nyst> Speaking of which, I think it's AMAZING that all the main crew have names that don't make me cringe.
<Dark_Horst> great. now i've done it
<Sumica> 00,10ok i like that NMM
<Starchaser> Kurra nope /me hides gloves
<Sumica> 00,10sounds sexy
<JunkerKun> MadSurge: Italian had another opening =)
<Kurra> Gosh French Pinkie sonds so excellent, like she's just waiting to share a champagne with you and then classy rave till midnight and then share another champagne with you till 3 am
<Dark_Horst> what wumic asaid
<Dark_Horst> wow
<Nyst> They could have been called Sunshine Rainbow and Lollipop Hugs.
<Dark_Horst> how did i do that?
<MadSurge> JunkerKun: avoid the second season opener, it suuuuuucks :D
<JunkerKun> MadSurge: D=
<RainbowAsh> Does my crown no longer count? Maybe it would if you had one
<Kurra> POR TU JOUR
<HavokOC> i vote for ep1 in every language
<Kaidrin> I wonder if Bon-Bon's voice stays the same throughout in differevt languages?
<Nyst> pour toujours
<Dark_Horst> HavokOC: i dont think you know what you're getting into
<Sumica> 00,10ok lets find some party of one
<Kaidrin> yes
<MadSurge> JunkerKun: but Discord, Chrysalis and Luna got great voices :$
<HavokOC> Dark_Horst: Thing is, i've done it once already
<RainbowAsh> Sumica, what? No, I need closure
<Nyst> One thing I don't know is, do the french not have a word for pony?
<MadSurge> :D
<Dark_Horst> HavokOC: you.... are not human
<Kaidrin> What about :P
<HavokOC> Dark_Horst: Ofc not. I'ma pony

<Kaidrin> "you heard her, being attacked by bees!"
<Dark_Horst> roberto?
<RainbowAsh> No Problemo Roberto? Wat?
<MadSurge> NO PROBLEMO ROBERTO :D
<Kurra> i think that was a really unfriendly thing to do that moment, and it's only made more horrible by the dogsqualing foley sound as Pinkie's head gets JAMMED in the door ;;
<JunkerKun> No problemo Roberto?
<Sumica> 00,10I wonder if some one has compiled just that bit in multy launages

<Dark_Horst> kinda makes me wonder if they're all voiced by the same person
<JRP2234> mica I want your babys
<RainbowAsh> Dark_Horst, I think they might
<Nyst> I only hope they used actual regional accents for the voices.
<MadSurge> Oh you Pinkie
<Nyst> That would be amazing.

<Kurra> I DO have synesthesia in ONE thing
<Gold_Demona> JunkerKun: Baya baya baya :P
<Kurra> when I hear Spain Spanish being talked, I smell old unventilated stale old-building air
<HavokOC> Sumica, swedish songs?
<HavokOC> :3
<RainbowAsh> Whew, so many trixies
<Kurra> and I'm like UUUGH CAN'T TAKE IT @_@
<DaringDerpy> :)
<Sylandest> nick jr showed this?
<MadSurge> Aaaaand geman!
<Dark_Horst> we gonna have a whole ep?
<pot80_GLaDos> i thought that was gonnah be the mlp glitch remix for a second :(
<MadSurge> *r
<DaringDerpy> I never watched a german episode before
<DaringDerpy> it's like watching dubbed animé
<Kurra> We should see German Discord. See how that sounds :)
<Sumica> 00,10did it just say pony rich?"
<Dark_Horst> i dont think so
<Dark_Horst> maybe i just wasnt listening
<Dark_Horst> could very well be
<RainbowAsh> Sumica, the german dub is about a fiscal crisis now
<Dark_Horst> hm.... not so good job on the intro
<RaveBrony> Oh god, that theme o_e
<Sumica> 00,10wannna come?
<p4ngya> better than the french one imo
<RainbowAsh> Did they just sing "arish ponies"?
<Dark_Horst> no
<JRP2234> mica i want your boy babys
<Kurra> Kommst du mit? Coming you with? lawl he
<RaveBrony> Whats the name of that pony?
<Sumica> 00,10shnel
<RaveBrony> THe one that talked
<Kurra> SCHNELL
<Dark_Horst> *Schnell
<DaringDerpy> RainbowAsh: there is no fiscal crisis in germany. at the moment the last tax estimate is all over the media. again better than expected. the greek and the ones with the fiscal crisis
<Kurra> TO ZE POINT DUMKOPF
<DaringDerpy> -and +are
<Dark_Horst> "horse in the moon"
<Dark_Horst> fuck
<ekips> Das Pferd im Mond?
<ekips> ohai btw
<Dark_Horst> sup
<Kurra> was bed...bideu... bedeutet?
<DaringDerpy> stute im mond klingt auch nicht besser
<Kurra> 'what does that mean'
<Dark_Horst> true
<Dark_Horst> didnt know you were german :D
<DaringDerpy> ^^
<HavokOC> fomnutn
<Dark_Horst> vonnöten
<Kurra> AUSGEZEICHNET
<DaringDerpy> spike sounds too old
<RainbowAsh> DaringDerpy, oh politics. Basically the strength of the Euro is great for Germany as an export oriented country and very bad for counries dependent on imports, like Greece. But the more the weak Euro countries collapse, the closer the crisis will draw to Germany as well, unless they disolve the currency union before that point. But in any case, there are soon going to be a lot of poor and desperate neighbors who have a lot of reason to be very mad at Ge
<RainbowAsh> rmany.
<Vivix> not Germany
<Vivix> EU
<Sumica> 00,10dat too big to desplay message
<Vivix> people will be mad at EU and EØS
<ekips> ugh, politics
*Kurra gets mat at germanium, stupid element, Ge
<RainbowAsh> Like use the weapons sold by the Germans to them to pay Berlin a visit mad
<DaringDerpy> RainbowAsh: actually, a weak currency is better for export. raises the local purchasing power of the exporter
<Vivix> also that last line, fuck you RainbowAsh
<Kurra> O_O;;
<Dark_Horst> RainbowAsh: that on the other hand would make the rest of europe very mad
<Kurra> nangerdauert
<Dark_Horst> RainbowAsh: eurp problems or not, germany is the economic center of europe. trying to start a war would affect the whole continent
<ekips> Süppchen?
<ekips> there is not even one soup
<DaringDerpy> there will be no war
<SpeccyRush> all dem abble
<Sumica> 00,10not bad english
<Dark_Horst> of course not
<Vivix> besides, the temperature in Europe don't seem to be "I'm mad at Germany"
<Dark_Horst> governments arent that stupid
<Dark_Horst> stupid yes, THAT stupid? now
<Dark_Horst> *no
<Vivix> ^^
<Kurra> The Germans are good at making things. Like English in German.
<Vivix> and isn't EU hq in France?
<DaringDerpy> the communists are mad at germany...but they are always mad. at everyone and everything
<Vivix> Hehe
<Kurra> the communists must be mad because their heyday ended in 1989 :D
<RainbowAsh> DaringDerpy, actually you are right. Still, weak countries would like to devaluate their currency in order to reduce their debt problems, but they can't because of the shared currency.
<DaringDerpy> rainbow dash sounds strange
<Kurra> Oh gosh
<Dark_Horst> main problem with the dub. the voices dont really suit the characters
<Kurra> oh gosh
<Sumica> 00,10wonderbalds
<Dark_Horst> but it could've been worse
<Kurra> insipration strikes @_X
<ekips> the wonderbalds are very very bald
<Vivix> I thought Norwegian dub was weird, Spike sounded like an old woman
<RainbowAsh> DaringDerpy, we have all been growing up during probably the single longest peaceful period in the history of Europe. That doesn't mean this age will last until the end of time.
<Vivix> We have? What about all the wars in the 90s?
<Dark_Horst> you kinda noticed ehr reading lines there
<Colt_Brovakiin> Good afternoon everyone! :)
<Sumica> 00,10bibelotec?
<ekips> Bibliothek
<Vivix> biblotek
<Dark_Horst> ekips wins the cookie
<DaringDerpy> RainbowAsh: yes. these countries have no developed fiscal system. everyone evaded taxes, and the government paid its bills with the money printing press...so in the end, through the inflation, everyone paid anyway. doesn't work anymore if the central bank follows a stability strategy. they knew it when they joined. they faked their statistics to be able to join. now the fraud backfired
<Sumica> 00,10bleh, so tired
<RainbowAsh> Vivix, the only european war I can remember in the 90s was in serbia. But other than that, I don't think there was that much armed strife.
<Vivix> Georgia, Serbia and Bosnia was same I think- Libanon I guess was outside, but was tons of european soldiers
<Vivix> and I guess many here are old enough to remember the DDR
<DaringDerpy> fluttershy :)
<DaringDerpy> meh
<MadSurge> *squeak*
<Vivix> Because of allies, I don't think we've got any european war close in sights
<RainbowAsh> Vivix, yeah, in the last 20 years Europe has exported a lot of warfare, but there was little conflict at home. There was never an armed conflict with east germany I think.
<Dark_Horst> there wasnt
<Vivix> No, true, but I remember european wars, nothing as fierce as the years before us
<Dark_Horst> except
<Dark_Horst> ...how did that word get into here?
<MadSurge> Jugoslavia?
<Dark_Horst> actually planned to wripe that into skype
<Dark_Horst> *write
<Vivix> Well I know a lot of post sovjet armed conflicts
<Vivix> but I don't know their names
<Sumica> 00,10gonna end it here after pinkie
<Kurra> hey speaking of wars... does anyone know if currently, there is the risk of war with any country and Cuba, or any two countries or more in South America?
<Vivix> But we still have NATO and Warzaw pact, it's just silly to say someone will attack Germany because of EU
<Vivix> and EU != Germany
<SpeccyRush> there she is
<RainbowAsh> Vivix, the Warzaw pact is still in effect?
<Kurra> I had a really really horrible nightmare last night, and I can't tell if the threat of war was real, or if it was dreamed :(
<Vivix> I think parts of it is
<MadSurge> Sumica: work? Or bed?
<DaringDerpy> cuba? no. venezuela might start a conflict. but the chance is low. and argentine might start something about the falklands again.
<Vivix> Wiki it, I'm reading
<Sumica> 00,10sleep
<Sumica> 00,10much sleep
<MadSurge> Sumica: ahhh, then good night :)

<DaringDerpy> the horse head nebula?
<Kurra> okay
<Kurra> thanks RainbowAsh... just... bad bad dreams last night
<Kurra> sometimes can't remember if my memories were made in dreams or in real life, and that's a freaky enough sensation in itself.
<JRP2234> playing ageist 21 bots with the highest difficult setting on is not fun in doom 2.
<RainbowAsh> Kurra, I totally know that feeling. It can be quite disconcerting
<Invi> and so, the chatroom became undead

<RainbowAsh> Hi Brovakiin
<Snow> did you see the new bronies react btw?
<Lil_B> ok, so the S3 starts 15:00 UTC, germany is UTC+1, that means it starts 16:00 here right?
<Lil_B> hey RainbowAsh :)
<Jake> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 8 days, 21 hours, 9 minutes, 33 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
<RainbowAsh> Hi Lil_B
<MLP_Brovakiin> Snow: I saw the video, but I refused to watch it :P
<Invi> is germany really UTC *1?
<Jake> yes it seems
<Lil_B> Invi yep,
<Tervicz> Hey, will the brony ad also be broadcasted then?
<Invi> oh okay i see
<Jake> we are east from london so yes
<otakon> brb
<Lil_B> so, 16:00 is correct for us tight? (I'm bad with Timezones )
<RainbowAsh> Lil_B, yes, that sounds correct
<Lil_B> right*
<Jake> Lil_B: yes
<Lil_B> nice :)
<MisterSkids> why do teeth suck so BAD, i just got a random toothache for no reason
<Jake> wasn't it 20:00 for s2?
<Snow> Jake: things change
<Jake> yup
<Jake> well
<Snow> and i say DEAL WITH IT
<Lil_B> because I'm moving to a new House on exactly that day and I was worried that I may miss it because of work, but My family should be ok with 16:00
<Tervicz> It's the old hour
<Jake> at least its on ytube at 20:00 then
<havokoc> Aeiou
<Lil_B> I really wanna watch it here on Bronystate :3

<RainbowAsh> The premier is going to be a full hour of ponies, right?
<Tervicz> sure
<Snow> pfff, why watch it on yt when you can watch it here?
<Jake> hey it has 2 parts so double play and proccessing time
<Tervicz> There will be less lag on youtube
<Snow> <--- watched season 1 and 2 in 2 days straight
<Invi> ditto ^^
<Snow> >_> <_<
<Jake> (based on canterlot wedding 2 hours should be correct
<RainbowAsh> Tervicz, youtube won't be chuck full of chatty goodness.
<Lil_B> even if my room is empty except for my PC, and even if I unplug my PC the second it's over to drag it up there, I'm watching it here!
<Snow> i was stressed ok? i had my exams after the weekend!
<Alchemist> Wont they show the two parter on two separate weeks?
<Lil_B> ohey Alchemist
<Snow> because some people cant take the suspence
<Alchemist> hi Lil_B !
<Jake> maybe
<Tervicz> No, episode 3 is on the 17th
<Snow> it wil litterally kill them.
<Jmo> o_O..
<Jake> someone go over to wiki and look it up
<Alchemist> Thats great
<RainbowAsh> Snow: Wow... I needed four days for season one up to episode 19 the first time around
<Snow> RainbowAsh: exam stress is a great motivator
<Lil_B> damn, someone made a Portal Album just with steady Calming Noises and Sounds, each song is longer than 15min, but I love it, so relaxing
<RainbowAsh> Alchemist, I distinctively remember reading somewhere officialish that they would show both parts on the same day
<Lil_B> sometimes I think I still haven't wacthed all the episodes
<Jake> Lil_B: do you mean "songs to test by"?
<RainbowAsh> Snow, yeah, I know, there is no limit on what you can achieve when you are supposed to do something else
<Alchemist> RainbowAsh: I cant remember if they showed the S2 premier at the same time or 1 week apart...
<RainbowAsh> Alchemist, a week apart.
<Lil_B> Jake no, that's the official Album (btw a Actual Physical Edition of that camde out recently!)
<Jake> neato
<Invi> I think I go to bed so i can watch the movies later. c y'all at about 0:00h ^^
<Lil_B> Jake 4 Discs, the 4th one has Portal 1 Songs
<Snow> RainbowAsh: i watched it because there wasnt anything else that could keep my mind off my exams(dont know how its called in english but i have failure fear) and a guy at my schooo watched so i gave it a try.
<Invi> oh wait it's thursday
<Lil_B> Invi Movies?
<RainbowAsh> Invi: Movies? Tonight?
<Snow> school*
<Lil_B> Jake the Album I ment is called "Dream with Portals" you can get it for free on Bandicamp
<Invi> okay, cancel dat ^^
<RainbowAsh> Snow: I completely understand. And, did ponies help you with your exam?
<Lil_B> sleep cancelled for Invi
<Snow> RainbowAsh: i passed with a 5.6, just enough to pass
<Invi> Lil_B, *early sleep ^^

<Jmo> :<

<Invi> this day felt like 2 days ^^
<Jake> my sis once dreamed she was so bad they had to make a new mark for her
<Invi> that is actually cool
<Snow> Jake: ditto here
<Jake> then she passed with 1.4
<Snow> i even dreamed i had to live in a box
<Lil_B> Invi I slept today too after I got homw and wated to watch some Videos from my Bed... I hate it when that happens >.<
<Invi> ^^
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Ballad of the Two Sisters
<Lil_B> Computer is on and I'm sleeping away valuable Time >.<
<Jmo> hrm
<Invi> Lil_B, c'mon sleep is important ^^
<Invi> or caffeine. choose one ^^
<RainbowAsh> Snow: Before my last exam, I imagined what each of the mane 6 would say about the worries I had. Like Twilight saying how she failed at Lesson Zero and it turned out to be ok in the end. That worked surprisingly well.
<Snow> who needs sleep when you have bronystate?
<Lil_B> Invi I know, but I wanna sleep at night and not during the day when I can dfo Stuff ^^
<RainbowAsh> Lil_B, you can do stuff at night, too
<Invi> I should actually start finally doing stuff :D
<Snow> Lil_B: be happy, i fall asleep whenever my body wants it.
<RainbowAsh> Snow: Narcolepsy?
<Lil_B> RainbowAsh not when you have people in the house that are complaining otherwise, and who WILL turn off the power... like my Mom
<RainbowAsh> Lil_B, ah, that sucks.
<Invi> yay my mum never does that ^^
<MisterSkids> oh hydrocodon, how u make the tooch pain go away

<Barb|Meh> RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!
<Barb|Meh> Its to late for me
<Barb|Meh> Just go.
<AJIsAwesome> I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON! ;~;
<VenHur> I'm saying I ain't a christian, but I had a feeling that we're getting a HELLUAH controversy from christians...
<Shizuka> 13i'm confused
<pot80_GLaDos> heeeyaaayaaayyaaaa
<Shizuka> 13what controversy
<SolarWing> ok...um, whats going on here?
<Shizuka> 13they're vegetables
<Rustymeat> Whats going on here?
<GilDash> Controversy? Where?
<Barb|Meh> I can clear this right up. YEs. I am the sexiest here.
<VenHur> Shizuka: No, no, it's because of the message of "God loves you all" in the show, Trust me, I researched.
<Barb|Meh> I have ALL the creditials
<Shizuka> 13it's controversial?
<SolarWing> ...i agree with Barb
<pot80_GLaDos> Barb|Meh heyyayaaayaaaaaaya no
<VenHur> Shizuka: On the NBC brodcasts, It was, they edited all those christian stuffs out.
<Shizuka> 13well that's NBC
<VenHur> The More You Know!
<Shizuka> 13you don't watch veggie tales on local channels, you watch it on VHS like a real filly
<Barb|Meh> I need a cigar
<SolarWing> I need therapy...
<Barb|Meh> Kicking habits are a pain.
<Barb|Meh> SolarWing: Sounds liek a personal problem
<pot80_GLaDos> shoke an a pancake?
<Barb|Meh> Hah haha.
<Barb|Meh> Hah..
<pot80_GLaDos> *smoke
<alexxm> veggie tales is controvisual?
*Barb|Meh pulls back the hammer on his gun
<Barb|Meh> Say it again.
<AJIsAwesome> I need food.
<Shizuka> 13the only controversy i ever knew of with veggie tales was they edited the bunny song
<pot80_GLaDos> pipe an a crepe?
<AJIsAwesome> What happened with the Bunny Song?
<Barb|Meh> lmao
<Barb|Meh> pot80_GLaDos: you alright.
<Barb|Meh> And that is enough rp out of me
<pot80_GLaDos> austen powers?
<Barb|Meh> Si.
<AJIsAwesome> I didn't really watch Veggie Tales as a kid. I only had one or two books about it. :D
<VenHur> alexmm: Again, the NBC broadcats removed all the christians messages because, I don't know, maybe because "Ooh, VeggieTales is made for the americans! FUCK YEAH, AMERICA!" or something.
<pony_3290> hey guys, I just got my fifth gym badge in Pokemon black 2
<pot80_GLaDos> cigar an a waffle?
<Shizuka> 13VenHur: NBC edited it out because they're gigantic wimps
<VenHur> Shizuka: Agreed.
<Shizuka> 13editing out the christian messages from veggie tales defeats the whole point of the show
<SolarWing> im on deviantart as i talk to you all in the same browser :D
<Shizuka> 13considering it's largely based around retelling stories from the bible
<VenHur> Yeah, I'm semi-christian too, but I don't want peoples to give me the DAFUQ face when I said "I belive in the God!" or something.
<VenHur> ...Heh...
<VenHur> ...I'm kind of a Ned from The Simpsons if you ask me...heh...
<pot80_GLaDos> how were they even left with a show after editing out all the christian stuff?
<Barb|Meh> !! I forgot about this movie http://i.imgur.com/A4uvD.jpg
<Barb|Meh> Aw. It so should of been streamed yesterday
<Shizuka> 13i think at best you'd have... both the are you my neighbor sets.. and... just maybe larry's lagoon
<Shizuka> 13everything else was retelling a story
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Brony Thank You Fund Ad Schedule
<SolarWing> i have a question, what is Cadance's cutiemark?
<pot80_GLaDos> no there was larry tales about larry being a super hero
<Shizuka> 13yeah larry boy i guess
<Shizuka> 13that's a spinoff though
<AJIsAwesome> SolarWing: A couple of hearts, I think.
<SolarWing> no no no, its a blue gem in the shape of a heart but what dose it represent :/
<Shizuka> 13blue gems shaped like hearts
<Shizuka> 13that's her talent, she's a gemcutter
<SolarWing> ...nah
<AJIsAwesome> It represents her ability to fix lovers' relationships, I think.
<SolarWing> then why a blue crystal heart?
<AJIsAwesome> Why not?
<RainbowAsh> Blue gem shaped like a heart with golden thingies at its side that kinda look like sea ponies
<alexxm> do we have a stream
<pot80_GLaDos> I will try to fix you
<AJIsAwesome> Nope.
<SolarWing> hum...the gem kind of looks like a fire ruby but...blue :/
<AJIsAwesome> Why does Pinkie Pie have a pink balloon amongst 2 yellow balloons? Because that's the way she was designed.
<RainbowAsh> SolarWing, for the same reason cherilee's cutie mark are three flowers.
<SolarWing> oh and btw pinkies is a yellow among two blue :P
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Hot Topic Pony Promotion

<AttackWithHugs> http://imgur.com/YqrjT
<Chrysalis> but they never got a response of the guy, so they didnt put it
<VenHur> As in FIRE Emblem.
<Shizuka> 13optifine lets me kill distance fog and use high res textures
<AttackWithHugs> PASSION AND FIYAAAH

<OohShiny> Polydunami: so Sain is supposedly a Pedophile in the Japanese version?
<Michael> this remembers advance wars to me :p
<Polydunami> Ephebophile*

<VenHur> And fishes.
<Kimori> yeah..
<Dark_Horst> flying fish
<Everlasting_Joy> I love it when you have to back track to some spot earlier in a game and just smoke the now weak enemies :).
<Kimori> Your probably getting more sleep than me these days
<Dark_Horst> and they#re ridden by sharks
<Dark_Horst> with laserguns
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Robotdragon9. :)

<GilDash> Robotdragon9: Here, have another one! XD
<Kjakings> 7Stormy. you're female, right?
<Stormy> :( I actually do usually get decent sleep

<Robotdragon9> GilDash gaaah the pings
<VenHur> Woo hoo! Level up, muddafuckah!
<Stormy> Kjakings: You knew that... right??
<Everlasting_Joy> Alchemist: How so?
<Dark_Horst> skyrim did a little better there
<GilDash> Robotdragon9: Aww, they love you really.
<Robotdragon9> *yay*
<Ryunosuke> when I seen Robotdragon9's name, I thought of the Robot Cat song :)
<Michael> Robotdragon9: all the pings :D
<Dark_Horst> they had both, enemies levelling with you, and the ones that were stuck on theirs
<Kjakings> 7Yeah I just needed something to get your attention and lead in with.
<MadSurge> GilDash! :$
<GilDash> Dark_Horst: It was more complicated then that.
<GilDash> MadSurge: Holla! :)
<Stormy> lol, whatever works I guess :P
<Alchemist> Everlasting_Joy: iirc, the enemies got gradually stronger as you leveled up, so basically fight difficulty was constant throughout the whole game.
<Kjakings> 7I require your opinion on a christmas present for my girlfriend.
<RainbowAsh> Does mlponline.net work for anyone else?
<Everlasting_Joy> Alchemist: Dang.
<Robotdragon9> *hears about possible new star wars movies*....guys...plz...tell me its not true :(.....
<Dark_Horst> GilDash: probably. but i didnt want to walloftext
<Stormy> Alright, what is it?
<Polydunami> RainbowAsh, it's under a lot of strain right now

<thelonepony> sorry man, but it is :(
<Dark_Horst> wait... mlponline?
<GilDash> Dark_Horst: Essentially, each area has a set level range. A minimum level and maximum level, set when you enter the area for the first time.
<RainbowAsh> Robotdragon9, Disney bought Lucasfilm.
<Dark_Horst> they finished or something?
<Robotdragon9> FFFFUUUUUUUUUU
<AdamTheDuck> Bye everyone. Gotta go.
<Robotdragon9> *cries*
<thelonepony> bye AdamTheDuck :)
<Michael> bye AdamTheDuck
<RainbowAsh> Dark_Horst, they just released the first single player episode, but their web page seems to be down
<Polydunami> Disney produced Pirates of the Caribbean
<MadSurge> OHO, WHO MIGHT THE GRANDDAUGHTER BE
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care AdamTheDuck.
<Michael> and Avengers
<Stormy> If gothic stuff is her thing she would probably love that
<AJIsAwesome|KIU> bye AdamTheDuck :)
<GilDash> Robotdragon9: Now let's be fair, it'll probably be better then what George Lucas did with I, II and III.
<VenHur> NewDCD: Had you heard, Disney brought Lucasfilm...for 3. BILLION. DOLLARS! ...Oh yeah, that means more Jar Jar Blinks.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye AdamTheDuck :)
<Stormy> You guys have been together 6 months, right?
<AJIsAwesome|KIU> The eyes.....OF EVIL!!!
<Michael> VenHur: inb4 jar jar binks jedi?
<VenHur> Michael: [notamused face]
<GilDash> < I don't think that's how you spell Marquis. :S
<Dark_Horst> littlekuriboh could work with this
<Robotdragon9> GilDash i liked the other trilogy, but it wasnt all that good...i just hoped ur right
<Ryunosuke> i see fire emblem on stream
<Robotdragon9> *hope
<Kjakings> 7aye.
<Kjakings> 7seven in three days
<Polydunami> Well if they DO feature Jar Jar Binks, I'd hope for them to make him a useful character.
<Stormy> I might not be the right person to judge this kind of thing, but necklaces I think are a good gift for that length of time
<GilDash> Robotdragon9: So do I. Either way, I'll be skeptical until I see something from them.
<Kjakings> 7Thankee.
<Robotdragon9> Aye
<Polydunami> Also, these are supposed to be sequel movies. Who knows if Jar Jar is still alive by that point?
<Kimori1> I'm pretty sure Kjakings knew you were a female Stormy >.>
<Kjakings> 7and yeah gothic stuff is her thing. less so now, mainly because of money issues.
<Stormy> Jewelry tends to mean you view it as serious, but something like a ring might be a little too serious
<Everlasting_Joy> Polydunami: :(
<Polydunami> So a dead Jar Jar will be sad?
<Robotdragon9> btw happy belated halloween everypony
<Everlasting_Joy> Polydunami: No, if he still is alive, that's sad.
<VenHur> Same to you, buddy.
<Kjakings> 7Ah. Thanks.
<Michael> Robotdragon9: happy belated Nightmare Night!
<Robotdragon9> Michael lol u too!
<Stormy> No problem
<Michael> nope
<Alchemist> wtf is happening in the stream?
<Polydunami> You don't know if he'll actually be a good character or not if they feature him.
<Everlasting_Joy> Friendship!
<VenHur> FRIENDSHIP, BITCHES!
<Polydunami> Anyway, I don't know any more about the new Star Wars movies than you guys
<GilDash> Just waiting to see if Disney uses the expanded universe at all or reboots things.
<Robotdragon9> my dad is taking me to town with 200$ and we are gonna shop around for geeky junk or whatever. I can buy some pony shirts and its the monday after season 3 release :)
<Polydunami> All I know is that Disney produced good movies.
<Cades> allo
<Michael> maybe darth donald?
<Polydunami> So how about Kingdom Hearts? Where would Star Wars fit into that? :D
<Everlasting_Joy> Michael: I've got Vader lines running through my head as spoken by Donald.
<Stormy> Hey
<VenHur> GilDash: Of course they won't reboot the concept, Disney had known Lucasfilm since the MGM Studios years...
<VenHur> ...You know...the...park...from Disney World...

<Polydunami> Darth Mickey?
<thelonepony> Michael: :D
<Stormy> Also that completely rules out a lot of things, unless you like wearing women's jewelry
<Kjakings> 7haha. I intend to do that with games. she's a gamer but just has no patience. I'll get them after like two, maybe three weeks.
<Everlasting_Joy> "Let's go to those houses and questiont he residents." How about we just beat the crap out of these bandits?
<VenHur> Michael: "My master, will you aid the dark side of the force?" "Ahuh, sure thing pal! If you do me one thing."
<Stormy> Sounds like me :P
<Robotdragon9> imagine mickey saying "are u threatening me master jedi?"
<VenHur> "...Bring Lucasfilm...TO DISNEY!"
<Michael> disney imperium
<VenHur> "NOOOOOOOOOO!!!"
<Polydunami> Too bad Darth Vader is going to be long dead by the new movie's setting.
<VenHur> Aw...that's too bad...Darth Vader is a kick ass villain...
<Everlasting_Joy> Polydunami: They'll perform some resurection spell on him or some garbage like that.
<Stormy> If I suck at a game I usually will just stop playing it because it's not fun
<Robotdragon9> im currently playing through condenmed 2 and resistance 3
<VenHur> Too bad he died around Episode VI.
<Robotdragon9> *le sad face
<Polydunami> Or someone is going to pose as Darth Vader?
<Polydunami> Possibly Luke himself? :D
<Michael> miss lord vader :(
<x1es> They could bring an old mark hammill back... With a beard.
<Kjakings> 7she won't suck at it, just has no attention span. It's impossible to get her to watch lengthy films.
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm guessing they'll bring Mark back, somehow.
<Stormy> Ah, I see
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey guys did you hear ? disney just bought marvel slowpoke.jpg
<Robotdragon9> i think the new empire's villans weren't as cool...from what ive seen
<GilDash> Depends if Hamil wants to come back or not.
<Polydunami> Hey, I just heard Disney bought Pixar
<Polydunami> :P
<Robotdragon9> brb dinner
<VenHur> Inb4 The Star Wars series goes all Castlevania.
<x1es> They'll be resurrecting obiwan, in a sense, by bringing back luke as obiwan mk2, to train someone else to fight against ...space ninjas.
<Everlasting_Joy> *facepalms
<Michael> VenHur: inb4 high school jedi
<Polydunami> Oh, one more thing. Yoda will also be no more.
<alexxm|foal> perhaps they'll base it off the eu
<VenHur> Michael: No, no, what I means is, A new Darth Vader arises, a new Skywalker must defeat the new Vader, bla bla bla bla blah. It's ridiculous, I know.
<Kjakings> 7although she does suck at every game
<Kjakings> 7every level on portal takes like an hour and a half.
<Kjakings> 7it's painful.
<Michael> VenHur: IKR :)
<Stormy> I suck horribly at Portal ;-;
<AJIsAwesome|KIU> NewDCD? You alright?
<alexxm|foal> what does the luck stat do
<Polydunami> Or, I dunno, Disney could actually make an entertaining addition to the Star Wars franchise. I mean, it's a possibility.
<x1es> Ok, Luke is the last Jedi, he's started a Jedi School. And just like that, it's a teenager movie.
<Everlasting_Joy> >: (
<Stormy> I've told that story way too many times here though so I won't repeat it :P
<Kjakings> 7she just doesn't learn. she memorises instead, which requires her to simply hurl herself at every problem until she finds the correct solution, then memorises it and repeats until the level is done.
<GilDash> Kyle Katarn... just saying.
<AJIsAwesome|KIU> ???
<Kjakings> 7we have occasionally discussed the negligence of her various schools for not at least testing her for a learning disability
<RainbowAsh> She broked it
<twilight_sprinkle> theres also mara
<AJIsAwesome|KIU> NewDCD? I think you need to turn down your background noise.
<Polydunami> Star Wars: Jedi Karate Kid.
<RainbowAsh> I AM SHOCKED
<Michael> inb4 alternate universe where luke is a highschool guy who discovers the force, directed by Michael bay
<pot80_GLaDos> "It came out effortlessly" lol
<x1es> Episode 7: Jedi Kid. With Mark Hammill as Mr Myag...I mean Luke.
<Stormy> Sounds like she's not very easily offended. XD
<RainbowAsh> Sell that sword to the next vendor.
<Everlasting_Joy> Watch as they find a sword that out does the Mani Katti.
<AJIsAwesome|KIU> :D
<Polydunami> So where would Old Princess Leia and Old Han Solo fit into this movie?
<VenHur> I'm back, missed anything?
<Everlasting_Joy> Polydunami: Probably dead.
<Michael> Wb VenHur
<AJIsAwesome|KIU> Nothing much, VenHur.
<x1es> Polydunami: They want their kid to be trained by Luke, duh.
<Polydunami> :(
<Everlasting_Joy> I mean, they're not mentioned...

<AJIsAwesome|KIU> ;d
<VenHur> "We're facing bandits", No shit, sherlock.
<AJIsAwesome|KIU> *:D

<AJIsAwesome|KIU> DAT THEME
<Polydunami> Oh, THIS music
<VenHur> IT'S THE FIRE EMBLEM THEME! FUCK YEAAAAH!
<Polydunami> This isn't the actual Fire Emblem theme :S
<GilDash> You know, I've never really seen anything relating to Fire Emblem, but this is intriguing me.
<VenHur> It's THE Fire Emblem theme to me, God damn it!
<Polydunami> Other than SSB?
<Stormy> you know you've found the right person when you've experienced all the bullshit they have to offer but you still want to be with them anyway
<Polydunami> More like the other FM theme :3
<Kjakings> 7Haha.

<Stormy> Can't have only one person in the relationship being bullshit-tolerant
<AJIsAwesome|KIU> :D
<pot80_GLaDos> :D timing
<GilDash> I swear these timings... XD
<VenHur> And by the way, have you noticed that most RPGs tooks place in a medieval-styled setting.
<Polydunami> Oops
<Everlasting_Joy> Florina is the Fluttershy of this group.
<Polydunami> And Star Ocean? And Terranigma?
<Kjakings> 7heh. fair.
<VenHur> A pegusis knight?! This game knows MLP BEFORE MLP!
<AJIsAwesome|KIU> You didn't scare me, Fluttershy. :D
<VenHur> ...And it was 7 damn years before it...
<Kjakings> 7*shrug* we've both taken a lot of bullshit and survived. xD she's helped me a lot.
<Polydunami> Yeah, no. MLP was around for a long time before Fire Emblem.
<pot80_GLaDos> soo this is basically advanced wars in an older setting then?
<Polydunami> Well, no, maybe a few years before
<VenHur> I mean G4, Polydunami.
<MadSurge> Polydunami: more like knows FiM before FiM
<AJIsAwesome|KIU> this game came long before advance wars, pot80_GLaDos :D

*Lyra|behaving is being well mannered
<Polydunami> Behave not for other ponies, but for yourself.
<Stormy> Same with Lambda and me.... I can be super dramatic but somehow he can still be patient with me
<AJIsAwesome|KIU> ^
<MadSurge> ARCHER, STAHP
<Lyra|behaving> hmm, nope :3

<Stormy> we were both each other's first "real" relationships, so I'm surprised we didn't screw up majorly
<JRP2234> i had a warid dream i stole a shit tone of kfc from work
<DeadpoolDash> mods are fun, especially naughty ones
<JRP2234> weird*
<Lyra|behaving> did you get away with it, JRP2234

<pot80_GLaDos> GilDash I'm awfull with references please excuse my ignorence
<Stormy> When he first started talking to me I pretty much just thought there was no way he actually liked me and probably just wanted to be friends or felt sorry for me or something
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> will is willing
<thelonepony> AttackWithHugs: I knew that <_<

<AttackWithHugs> AJIsAwesome|KIU, MLP_Brovakiin: I know right. Killed a skeleton and zombi spawner, got a record.

<MLP_Brovakiin> nice one! :3
<Kjakings> 7ah. we started talking as friends and just... clicked. massively confided in one another for about two months, and it was very weird. I just hated myself endlessly then, had a fuckton of issues like self-harming, couldn't believe she possibly liked me. Plus, by all accounts she was a lesbian which really threw a spanner in things.
<ekips> Dorcas is most probably dead.
<GilDash> VenHur: There's ya bad VA. Happy now? XD
<Polydunami> I just saw a full picture of Florina; apparently, she wears boots that go all the way to her thighs :3

<AJIsAwesome|KIU> I doubt it ALREADy happened, but I saw an article saying that one was in production.
<pot80_GLaDos> that can only end well
<GilDash> What could possibly go wrong?
<RaveBrony> well, dont look at my pic if you wnt proper shadowing xD
<pot80_GLaDos> nothing at all
<GilDash> Sorry, just thought they'd like to tempt fate a little more there. XD

<Sonny> oh OohShiny, if you are going to attend the comics I got so far I suggest you start at the beginning :p http://masdragonflare.deviantart.com/
<HavokOC> That script didn't have colors T.T
<Petrified_Discord> Maybe white is a color now?
<GilDash> HavokOC: It had bold in it though.
<cachi01|scaryshit> HavokOC: u got kik because of the script lol
<HavokOC> oh lol
<cachi01|scaryshit> HavokOC: u should ask the mods for permission
<GilDash> Or do it in another chatroom...
<HavokOC> yeah, probably xD
<OohShiny> Sonny: I didn't even read them yet, but I've already like the way you draw the eyes
<Lunar_Brony> Petrified_Discord white is an overabundance of light and black is a significant lack in light.
<Sonny> OohShiny: why thankd you ;)
<Lunar_Brony> Petrified_Discord white is a colour >_>
<HavokOC> wait, that was white?
<cachi01|scaryshit> purple is a fruit
<HavokOC> I only got normal text T.T
<thelonepony> HavokOC: you had Title Bolded
<Lunar_Brony> HavokOC the entire light spectrum
<Sonny> I would like to write a fanfic, put the problem Is that I don't know how to like "insert" the image into the piece I wrote
<HavokOC> Oh lol
<Sonny> I'll figure it out tough...
<HavokOC> Who's streaming?(if anyone is streaming)
<Petrified_Discord> Lunar_Brony: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1f5f4CEdJ1qdrhpf.gif
<OohShiny> Sonny: well, I find it kind of easy on "inserting" images in a fic. If it's the way I'm thinking
<AJIsAwesome> Petrified_Discord: :D
<Lunar_Brony> Petrified_Discord xD
<thelonepony> Petrified_Discord: :D
<OohShiny> Sonny: do you mean like, make the fanfic based on the image or sumthing? or the image being the core to it?
<cachi01|scaryshit> Petrified_Discord: DUN DUN DUUUUUN :D
<Sonny> I'll make the image afther I'm done writing the fanfic :p

<Ponies47> Hey Domo! :3
<Petrified_Discord> thelonepony: :| Stone cold killa
<twilight_sprinkle> ohai Domo
<OohShiny> I don't know why, but I named my OC Wander Syphon
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Domo and Stephano! :)
*Domo hugs all of you. "Hi~"
<OohShiny> it doesn't fit
<Sonny> OohShiny: So the thing is, afther he's done handeling the situation at hand that I'm making in the comics, he'll be a psychiatrist
<twilight_sprinkle> and hai Stephano
<thelonepony> Hi Stephano :)
*MLP_Brovakiin glomps thelonepony, and shouts "Pileon!" ;3

<OohShiny> Sonny: Just asking, Went conscious is correct to say?
<Petrified_Discord> OohShiny: Kinda sounds like a place
<Sonny> OohShiny: don't know :p
<Petrified_Discord> OohShiny: "We're gonna head on down to the Wander Syphon, wanna come?"
<OohShiny> Petrified_Discord: Wander is something linked to eletronics
<OohShiny> Petrified_Discord: while Syphon is Chemistry
<OohShiny> I'm confused
<Sonny> OohShiny: I've been trying to improve my drawing skills, and there's an actual difference noticable between the first and last comic :D
<Petrified_Discord> OohShiny: Um...electrolosis. Bam. Electricity and chemistry.
<Petrified_Discord> *ysis
<Sonny> OohShiny: give me a sign when you're done reading them ok?
<OohShiny> Sonny: np
<OohShiny> Petrified_Discord: it's eletronics and telecommunications...
<OohShiny> Petrified_Discord: any ideas?
<Petrified_Discord> Hmmm
<Sonny> OohShiny: The comics themselves are a little from one situation to another without an actual smooth line to go to the other part, (hard to explain in english) And I know that, just kind of the drawings that matter in these comics :p
<Petrified_Discord> Something Signal?
<Petrified_Discord> idk
*Petrified_Discord gives up
<OohShiny> damn it
<OohShiny> Sonny: I suggest you put red heart instead of the spa sister, in the first one

<CriticKitten> thelonepony: You kidding? AAA MMOs never release content this fast or in this quantity. Even the Korean ones (I played one, so I know). I'm still trying to catch my breath from the great Halloween event. ._.
<cachi01|scaryshit> cya MadSurge :)
<Sonny> OohShiny: yes it is, and Me too :D It's just that some words come in more natural then others >.>
<OohShiny> may you dream of ponies, MadSurge.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14is that hitting something with a pocky stick?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye MadSurge :)
<thelonepony> CriticKitten: Well stop playing the game for a day or two to catch your breath
<Sonny> CrimsonPhoenix: Everything on school and about 10 books in my free time
<thelonepony> :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> 10 books?
<Sonny> and I'm 17
<Sonny> :p
<CrimsonPhoenix> then why start on fanfics
<Sonny> CrimsonPhoenix: in total, :p
<OohShiny> Sonny: 10 books? God.. you are a pro
<cachi01|scaryshit> Sonny: wow 10
<Sonny> in total xD
<CrimsonPhoenix> just go ahead and let your inspiration flow
<Sonny> not liturally 10
<CriticKitten> thelonepony: Heck, I'm still legit surprised they're doing content patches this big, while still updating GW1 with new content. Their staff must be made of crazy people.
<CriticKitten> And bronies, judging from the last GW1 quest.
<Sonny> I wrote 2 actual books and 8 times the amount of a book
<Sonny> at least
<Sonny> :p
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> poking* fun fact i do have like six boxes of pockys in my room
<Sonny> but not actuall books xd

<thelonepony> CriticKitten: you think :P
<CriticKitten> Think?
<CriticKitten> I *know*.
<thelonepony> :P
<CriticKitten> Have you read the quest script?
<OohShiny> Sonny: I didn't write any books in my entire life, it would stop on the fourth ~ sixth chapter...
<Sonny> I also wrote some lyrics to some ideas of songs I had etc and some toughts I put on paper to set my mind straight
<CriticKitten> There is NO doubt it was written by a brony.

<OohShiny> Sonny: grammar hammer! *feel
<CriticKitten> Ah, here we go. You're tasked with hunting down an invisible pony that has escaped from his master's pen, and you have to find it before the elite pony-hunting squad of undead comes to kill it.
<Sonny> OohShiny: I've wrote an actual song that I would LOVE to make and create, but I don't really have time for it (drawing commissions friends asking me out moving to another house homework etc)
<Eli> Sonny: are you writing fics too?
<Sonny> OohShiny: I don't actually have any software for it eighter :p
<Sonny> Eli: I might write some yes ^^
<CrimsonPhoenix> apparently I have Dota 2......what
<CriticKitten> Now since it's invisible, you have to track it by its "peripheral pony particles" (abbreviated as PON-3).

<CriticKitten> "Just in case we run into any Elonian ponies out there, I'm told that Gum Drops has a mark shaped like a pumpkin on his flank." "Is the mark also invisible?" "Of course it... Oh yes...right. Never mind." <--- my favorite joke from the script.
<OohShiny> Sonny: what I mean is, you should go to the Arts colleg

<AttackWithHugs> weeping_pegasi82, tailgaters on the damn road. Especially on the intersate.
<OohShiny> and another thing... ponies are always naked, so we add clothes to them, and then, they can be sexy... what's wrong with me
<sonicdude558> Lower the Moon reminds me of http://derpy.me/1LFzZ
<AJIsAwesome> So how many planets have you been to, Phase4/

<CypressWerewolf> biggest peeve....drivers who follow behind you until a merge lane approaches, then they speed up to beat you to it

<Dark92Enigma> i'm CROWNING YA
<StuffCrusader> GarrettBrony acme will never be as good as apeture

<Dark92Enigma> OohShiny: what it standed for again?
<Fluttershyfan158> HE DID!

<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<DerpyMuffins> ^^
<cachi01|scaryshit> ^^^

<fluttercry> 05,15Seriously Questionable Ethics 1 is boss
<AttackWithHugs> Then play the hell out of it and then I discover a new artist
<Spell-of-Gaming> I heard it was the DS version.

<cachi01|scaryshit> iron is so fucking awesome i love AC:Revelation trailer
<fluttercry> 05,15and Deus Ex HR has fantastic music as well
<AttackWithHugs> And I remember this song from one of Shizuka's streams earlier this year
<OohShiny> Spell-of-Gaming: in the DS there is an extra part, where Schala fusions with Lavos, creating the time devourer from Chrono Cross
<Big_Macintosh_1992> i came across a game kind of like audiosurf... but its online and free
<cachi01|scaryshit> and i love dearly beloved

<Lunar_Brony> It's the one I'm thinking of, anyways

<twilight_sprinkle> hell, even that little girl was more willing to fight
<twilight_sprinkle> lawl cashie
*Lunar_Brony has never played a Final Fantasy game
<sub06905> ^
<Kammerjunk> Ditto.
<twilight_sprinkle> i only played crisis core on psp
*Lunar_Brony feels no shame
<AJIsAwesome> ^^^^
<DaringDude> #same
<twilight_sprinkle> crisis core was fuuun
<flutterchu> Shizuka: is popular from bronystate but.....i dont know, but is she popular on youtube?, is she even on youtube?
*weeping_pegasi82 plays as many kingdom hearts games as she can
<weeping_pegasi82> the good ones
<cachi01|scaryshit> i've only played ff 1,2,3 dissidia,dissidia 012, ffX, ffXIII, ffXIII-2
<Starchaser> epic thrash metal part NOW
<twilight_sprinkle> oh i also played dissidia demo, as also tons of fun
<cachi01|scaryshit> i always wanted to play crysis core
<cachi01|scaryshit> is? it good
<cachi01|scaryshit> is it good?*
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01|scaryshit: do it, its awesome, especially the story and characters. the one problem are the side missions
<Lunar_Brony> I have 2 friends who are into Kingdom Hearts and have tried to get me into it. Problem is, I don't have anything to play the games on, except 3DS/DS which is only 2 games.
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01|scaryshit: you only need to do the side machines if you want to get magic and items and moves you cant normally get
<twilight_sprinkle> *side missions
<Starchaser> epic solo
<cachi01|scaryshit> twilight_sprinkle: the battle system is like kingdom hearts or rpg?
<Lunar_Brony> this part . . .
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01|scaryshit: ive never played kingdo mhearts, but in cc its not turnbased, from what ive seen of kh ts like kh

<twilight_sprinkle> also, sephiroth was baws in cc
<cachi01|scaryshit> dammit brentalfloss
<Shizuka> 13a) that was a very treble heavy song...
<Lunar_Brony> Kingdom Hearts is an RPG, but the battle system crosses between something I can only describe as RPG and action-swordfighting
<Shizuka> 13b) i was certain for a while there it was going to break into E1M1 of doom
<cachi01|scaryshit> lol
<Lunar_Brony> it also differs on which game in the series you play
<AttackWithHugs> E1M1?
<cachi01|scaryshit> Shizuka: you should do that one
<Lunar_Brony> each has a unique battle system
<cachi01|scaryshit> Shizuka: E1M1
<twilight_sprinkle> whats e1m1
<twilight_sprinkle> eva?
<twilight_sprinkle> movie 1?
<cachi01|scaryshit> twilight_sprinkle: episode 1
<cachi01|scaryshit> mission 1
<cachi01|scaryshit> doom
<twilight_sprinkle> o ok

<J_E_Smith71> Polydunami: You busy Sat?
<Polydunami> Not likely
<Polydunami> You mean Saturday morning?
<J_E_Smith71> I meant Saturday afternoon during the Euro Night showing of it
<AdamTheDuck> Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus.
<Polydunami> So long as they show the A movie first.
<AdamTheDuck> Most creative movie title ever.
<J_E_Smith71> Polydunami: Course they will
<Polydunami> My guess is this title fits the category of "Best movie no one ever saw".
