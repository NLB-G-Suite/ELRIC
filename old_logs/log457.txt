<MahBoi777> it was awesome!
<valoreins> is it safe to discuss avengers here?

<Tefacehuggah> yes
<cachi01> MahBoi777: u didnt leae in the credits right
<Tefacehuggah> its not that bad
<MahBoi777> cachi01: NOPE!
<Dan> noo I havent watched it yet :(
<MahBoi777> I won't spoil Dan

<MahBoi777> IKR
<cachi01> AT THE END CELESTIA KILLS SPONGEBOB AND HULK REIGNS THE WORLD
<Dken2021> I think I feel stupid for not watching the avengers with my cousins that one time
<SunderlandPony89> Neither have I, but I dont really care about spoilers. Probably wont ever see the movie
<Ponies47> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYUP
<CupcakeWarrior> Why was there so much hype over the avengers? Its just another superhero movie
<RAWRity> I saw avengers with some friends. When the credits started, they started getting up. I just stayed seated and said "Where do you think you're going?"
<Dken2021> CupcakeWarrior I guess crossovers?
<CupcakeWarrior> Why wouldnt you leave during the credits?
<Ninjazz> CupcakeWarrior: It's better than it sounds.
<MahBoi777> cachi01: the Hulk is just badass

<CupcakeWarrior> ded
<Dan> I was going to watch it with my old friends from back in highschool, but some had to cancel so we all canceled :(
<WallDives> but the hulk is so low tier...
<cachi01> CupcakeWarrior: THIS ONE HAS MORE SAMUEL L JACKSON
<Tefacehuggah> shir
<Om> Somebody cant take a hit~
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: because it's a superhero movie that's been built up in film canon for nearly 5 years, is written by a guy who's kind of a Nerd Sacred Cow, and has made buttloads of money.
<cachi01> MahBoi777: fave part was when hulk randomly punched thor xD
<MahBoi777> XD
<valoreins> and the movie reminds me of return of harmony lol
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: also, every marvel movie has a stinger/teaser for the next movie in the credits.
<Tefacehuggah> interesting bomb bye the way
<cachi01> and has shitloadds of easter eggs
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: Whats the next movie?
<RainBowJack> Sumica : lol i clicked on my pony songs and i played Super Speedy Cider song
<Tefacehuggah> lol
<Dan> RainBowJack: that song gets stuck in my head really easily
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: Avengers 2 most likely. There's aslo Captain America 2 and Iron Man 3.
<Tefacehuggah> y not octavia
<RainBowJack> Dan : yeah just like Day Aria is in my
<RAWRity> Also, though it's not in canon wiht the other ones, the director of Hot Fuzz is working on an "Ant-man" movie.
<Baremon> Sumica: What class are you?
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: There is an ant superhero?
<SunderlandPony89> Adept

<Dken2021> sounds kinda lame
<SilverSonic> there wasnt a tornado
<SilverSonic> internet however did go out for a bit around here
<SilverSonic> :P
<Dken2021> but if it's edgar wright, then it might be alright
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: it's by the guy who made Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, so it's kind of assured to be both silly as all hell, and awesome.
<Dan> MLP has some very sticky songs...
<Tefacehuggah> Ebeny

<GabeMoist> RAWRity, oh yes, it was before WMC, right?
<Ponies47> SparklyWaffles: That's a long shower! Dang! I shower in like 5 minutes. :P
<RainBowJack> Sumica : damn the Cerberus code i got in ME2 was already used :( to bad
<RAWRity> Because, technically, Spider's Web was never WMC'd
<CupcakeWarrior> My showers only take 20 minutes
<WallDives> SparklyWaffles: oh...that makes sense, I thought you liked it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm back. I had to leave before my cynicism tripped.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hate hating.

<GabeMoist> I'm sure Bronystate will love you RAWRity
<WallDives> rather, the dyed hair, you said you liked it.
<Ninjazz> You need to love more, Nittany_Discord.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I'm not given many reasons not to.
<MahBoi777> lol

<pony_5117> Mass Effect 3 = Epic Fail
<RAWRity> Ninjazz: what happen?

<cachi01> everypony is critizicing ME just because of the ending
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The problem is not bad games. It's good games ruined by bad business practices.
<SparklyWaffles> WallDives: lol

<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: what happen?
<pony_4306> what are your problems with the game?

<valoreins> EA's business tactics is bad and they should feel bad
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh god Nittany is ranting again
<Dken2021> eh, guess i'll go to bed then, nighty everyone, and remember: If the movie's directed by Edgar Wright, then it will be alright.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not.
<SparklyWaffles> My hands are blue :(
<RainBowJack> Sumica : did Garrus get a face repair?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I left so I wouldn't rant.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I'll leave again if I start.
<BlueFlare> 02drf had iPad dreams D:
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because I don't want to ruin the stream.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And ranting isn't helping the problem, so there's no use.
<RainBowJack> Sumica : his Armore seems nice agian
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: well, if you don't want to rant, feel free not to tell me. I'd just like to know. Been out of the loop.

<MahBoi777> hey ACS13123!

<Rain> holy hell, fluttercry and I came to bronystate on the same night :O
<ACS13123> I cant make it to the movie night tonight... or tommorrow :O i dont even know whats being streamed...
<MahBoi777> I always miss movie night:S
<Polydunami> I'm not certain I'd want to make it either, even though Samurai Cop has been cancelled
<Polydunami> Yeah, movie nights can be a slight hassle
<MahBoi777> yus
<Polydunami> I might be able to show up tomorrow, but I can't next week
<Polydunami> First three days of June, I'm away
<Rain> so, what exactly was wrong with samurai cop?
<MahBoi777> Samurai Cop? lol never heard of that
<crazypony> me neither
<coyboy> whats this?
<MahBoi777> Dungeon Defenders
<Polydunami> Oh hey coyboy :)
<Rain> Polydunami seems to know what it is
<MahBoi777> hello coyboy
<crazypony> hi coyboy
<coyboy> hello :)
<VioletGreySha> hay coyboy
<Polydunami> Actually, I've never heard of the movie until it was announced about 1 or 2 weeks ago
<MahBoi777> ah
<Polydunami> I just know that it was preemptively cancelled
<coyboy> im sure I've heard of that film from somewhere
<Polydunami> And now the million dollar question: what are we doing in place of the B movie then?
<MahBoi777> Samurai Cop sounds like a movie that wasn't very popular, but I dunno haven't seen it:P
<StupidSexyCJ> G3 episodes?
<Polydunami> xD
<MahBoi777> seems legit
<Polydunami> Yeah, maybe that would be better actually
<crazypony> we could show G1 episodes
<DaringDude> night
<DaringDude> -
<StupidSexyCJ> Samurai Cop getting cancelled makes me want to see it more...
<DaringDude> -
<Rain> dont know about you people, but I honestly like G1 G2 and G3

<crazypony> bye DaringDude
<Polydunami> I mean, sure the earlier gens can get a little grating for me, but still
<MahBoi777> Rain: lol, it's funny to see the reactions when mods stream it
<StupidSexyCJ> dont mind them either, which makes it fun for me when others cant stand them
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, that too xD
<crazypony> i like G1 and G2
<Polydunami> I haven't seen much of either
<Polydunami> Just G3 and G4
<crazypony> G3 is bareable
<Rain> I find the reactions annoying. Its a tv show, get over yourselves and stop yelling things like "my eyes!" "Oh god make it stop!"
<Rain> shit like that is just immature
<Polydunami> I was like that once :S
<MahBoi777> true
<ACS13123> Dis game i dont even know the name of...
<Polydunami> In a slightly joking way
<StupidSexyCJ> I like being immature

<Polydunami> I like having fun sensibly :3
<VioletGreySha> lol red orchestra free weekend on steam

<valoreins> thefinebros blocked videos made by other reaction videos :o
<d3rb> so Phase4, what is the advantage of a linux system? not trying to start a my os is better than your os debate, i really know very little about linix other than i belive its less compatible with stuff (which may not be true anymore)
<TheRandomkid321> If ya dont know your OS here. thsi will help ya... But who the buck desont know their os? http://www.moanmyos.com/
<StupidSexyCJ> lol bewbies

<Spell-of-Gaming> Haven't check their channel, though.
<TheRandomkid321> Spell-Of-Gaming yeah. Elders react. The first episode is out. its nyan cat :3
<Phase4> 00,02d3rb, its fast, open, and gives no fucks. you ask it to do something and it will do it

<valoreins> but then thefinebros became dicks and blocks all stillcosmo's videos
<TheRandomkid321> Elders react is my favorite of all the reacts mainly because its got people who i respect... Elders... I get beat up daily...
<TheRandomkid321> They need an elders react to my little pony FIM.
<Phase4> 00,02allso linux has sane file permisions
<d3rb> and you've lost me, im not a computer noob but I'm probably very casual by your standards
<TheRandomkid321> So.. No stream anymore?
<Phase4> 00,02d3rb, ever had that problem where you just cant open or share a file? none of that on linux, its super simple
<Brony123> Its gawn. FOREVAR

<Brony123>
<Spell-of-Gaming> I think I'll be installing Linux if Windows quits using 32-bit
<Brony123> So, whos gonna stream now?

<Lil_B> I would like to hear something from Koji Kondo
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> srs wrek will be like a animator
<pony_911> streamer?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> imagine bstate 2nd anniversary
<pony_911> that would be cool
<Eurobeat> the rainbow dash and scootaloo picture is freaking me out
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> 24/7 ponies
<Lil_B> like the Nazo no Murasame Jo Main Theme XD
<Eurobeat> serch rainbow factory (INSANE)
<Eurobeat> click the first thing
<Eurobeat> then thats the image
<pony_911> Eurobeat i hate that fic
<Eurobeat> i do to
<Eurobeat> rainbow dash will never kill scootaloo
<pony_911> yay
<Lil_B> I never really read a fic, I'm not much of an reader :/
<Eurobeat> even if she felt like it
<pony_911> screw scootaloo
<Eurobeat> ..
<Phase4> 00,02pony_911, :<
<MadSurge> Oh yeah, old timey music
<XAX> dem smooth beats
<Phase4> 00,02glen miller, in the mood
<Lil_B> I heard that tune in Parodius first!
<VDXRetrotainment> What song is this?
<Eurobeat> Trixies Funhouse is worser then the factory fic
<Eurobeat> and the cupcakes fic
<Eurobeat> i read it before i felt like puking
<pony_911> my vid keep buffering every 2 seconds !! ARGHHH:[
<VDXRetrotainment> Phase4: You streaming? =3
<MadSurge> Vynil's grandma was a jazzist :D
<Phase4> 00,02VDXRetrotainment, yup
<pony_911> really?
<VDXRetrotainment> Mind if I do one single request?
<Dark_Horst> so, we're in radio mode?
<Lil_B> well... Octavia COULD use her contrabass to play Jazz
<Eurobeat> Rainbow fun factory?
<Eurobeat> im wtaching that right now.. o-o
<MadSurge> Eurobeat: don't read those fanfics. They'll never be canon and just gross you out.
<pony_911> rainbow and factories just dont add up
<Dark_Horst> actually, i found cupcakes not half bad
<Eurobeat> i found trixie needed money
<VDXRetrotainment> dancing offbeat to the song, good video XD
<Phase4> 00,02VDXRetrotainment, feel free
<RainbowAsh> MadSurge, I thought it was a defining element of fanfiction that they never would be canon... at least not intentionally
<pony_911> MadSurge btw whats canon is it the song?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: imagine 24/7 ponies on bstate 2nd year anniversary
<Lil_B> Well, i read a "Clopfic" once, because i thought it was hilarious
<Eurobeat> then she cut applebloom or scootaloo in half with a chainsaw
<Dark_Horst> rainbow factory was... strange, trixies funhouse or whatever was plain overdone and decidedly gross. but cupcakes actually did something right
<Eurobeat> Dark
<pony_911> what?
<MadSurge> Lil_B: that's the only way to take bad fanfics for me :D
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ddam it google
<Eurobeat> Did you read trixes funhouse?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> why did u close bstate
<Eurobeat> did you puke?
<MelaPonie> WHY NO NEW PONIES?!??!?!
<d3rb> i dont get why cupcakes gets so much attention, its pretty average
<MelaPonie> when do we get new ponies?!
<pony_911> the only fic that i finished is "my little alicorn"
<VDXRetrotainment> Guys, lower volume D:
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> MelaPonie: ur such a troll
<RainbowAsh> pony_911, "canon" means facts of a fictional world as defined by the stories themselves and maybe word of the creator. The opposite is "fanon",i.e. what watchers would like to believe to be true in the world, but what hasn't been defined yet.
<MelaPonie> Alicorn_Prince_Shane, i r no troll...
<Dark_Horst> i think i might have glanced at it. think i stopped after a few paragraphs and did something else
<MelaPonie> when do we get new ponies?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> MelaPonie: shuddup... troll
<Lil_B> MadSurge yes, I just like over the top Stuff, that doesn'Ät take itself seriously
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> MelaPonie: in september
<Eurobeat> Trixies Funhouse... isnt fun
*Claude licks Alicorn_Prince_Shane
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> MelaPonie: ISH
<d3rb> not for a long time MelaPonie
<RainbowAsh> d3rb, the popularity of cupcakes is purely meme-driven in my opinion.
<Eurobeat> its in a warehouse..
<pony_911> RainbowAsh ...so basically its mean good then
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> o hai claude
<MelaPonie> :*(
<VDXRetrotainment> HERE IT COMES!
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> u in english class again Claude
<MelaPonie> september :*(
<MelaPonie> could be worse i guess!
<VDXRetrotainment> Epic new age classic music. <3
<Lil_B> I LOVE THAT SONG!
<MadSurge> Lil_B: excellent :)
<VDXRetrotainment> OVATIONS!
<MadSurge> :D
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> dat MUSIC
<Eurobeat> Spiderjack is really funny
<Lil_B> but i prefer "Beethoven's Virus"
<VDXRetrotainment> NEXT PART
<VDXRetrotainment> GO
<MadSurge> Octavia approves!
<Eurobeat> watch it its so funny XD
<VDXRetrotainment> Dem fingers...
<VDXRetrotainment> Next part! TRUMPET
<XAX> DAT HARPIST
<Dark_Horst> dude... what do you call that?
<VDXRetrotainment> COME ON RAMON!
<VDXRetrotainment> And FINISH
<RainbowAsh> pony_911, for instance, Pinkie having spent her childhood on a rockfarm is canon, because it was mentioned in the show. Scootaloo being an orphan is fanon, because, while her family is never shown, it has never been really stated outright one way or another.
<pony_911> my stream is frozen still i cant watch anything:[
<Lil_B> Lyra could play like this... if she had Fingers... (wtf am i saying i don't even like all those background ponys?!)
<Eurobeat> my little pwny
<VDXRetrotainment> Sayaka! Compensate. <3

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Spell-of-Gaming: the cutie marks as a alicorn but a alicron oc is op
*FlareChaser|Octavia is gonna be a Demon Hunter
<dshannon> hey um who's the one in charge of bronystate emails?
<Nether> quick question. the ToS doesnt allow talking about drugs... but being strictly technical. alsohol is a drug. so... would it be okay to talk about recommendations about alcohol?
<RaveBrony> Ill see what i can do...i dont even know how the game works yet x_x
<Meanwhile> I'm not sure if any one mod is assigned to handling the bronystate email dshannon.
<Kabaka> "the ToS doesnt allow talking about drugs"
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> RaveBrony: Wrek will teach like a new language
<dshannon> ah
<Kabaka> That's false
<klaxa> it does not prohibit talking about drugs directly, but it prohibits encouraging illegal actions
<Nether> well
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Meanwhile: u gonna curl the mo?
<FlareChaser|Octavia> RaveBrony: its easy! all you have to do is: clickclickclickclickclickclickclickcCLICKCLICKCLICKclickclick
<Meanwhile> Wat.
<Kabaka> Alcohol is not illegal (in most places), so, for most people, talking about alcohol is 100% okay.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Meanwhile: ur mustache
<FlareChaser|Octavia> and thats how you play Diablo.
<Kabaka> If you encourage a minor to drink alcohol, that might be an issue.
<Nether> just checking ^^ thanks Kabaka
*Claude jumps backonto Alicorn_Prince_Shnae

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Meanwhile: lol

<Spell-of-Gaming> IIRC, U.N. Owen is a bias used to describe a person who invites 10 random people to an island, killing them each.
<WallDives> Spell-of-Gaming: yay, Agatha Christie!

<doughnutjoe> Lag!
<Om> Lag, the best excuse for being a moron on WoW
<Sylandest> Om: ehehe :$
<VioletGreySha> hrhr
<WallDives> Lag, the reason me winning a fight leads to me being caught in a 33 hit combo.
<Om> Did something wrong? it was lag
<WallDives> bleh.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Lag: The alternate excuse for "My sister/brother did it!"
<Om> Precicely
<Sylandest> Spell-of-Gaming: now if only it worked at the workplace...lol
<WallDives> never heard that one (probably because it wont fly)
<Om> "Why are you not doing your work!?"
<Om> Uhhhh lag?
<Om> "Oh, that's okay then."
<WallDives> ..
<Sylandest> Om: :"I lagged out, sir! My internet's playing up!"
<Lag> Did someone say Lag?!?
<Sylandest> Om: "Fix your internet, Johnson! *tableflip*
<Om> Sylandest: lol
<WallDives> you know whats annoying? when the only people playing have a ping of 200ms.
<Om> I bet.
<Om> Not much you can do about that tho.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Having a ping of 200ms bothers me sometimes
<Sylandest> WallDives: I remember playing on my old computer, like way back, I would have so much trouble moving in Dalaran. I avoided it like the plague, lol
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> haha i just had a awesome idea
<WallDives> in a fighting game, thats a slide-show.
<Sylandest> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: do tell
<WallDives> 100ms is rough. 200ms is unplayable.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> some pony put the tone of their alarm on their phone to the shooo beee dooo sea ponies
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> and puts message saying for when alarm goes off the sea ponies are calling
<Sylandest> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: rofl. That would make for some interesting reactions where I am
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Sylandest: why lol?
<Bronysith> HIYA EVERYPONY!!!!
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> hey sith

<Airpuff> Om: I dont like how the US gouvernment strive to become the "top" of the world though, pumping out more than enough atomic bomb to blow the world to nothingness.. Its the Us and Russia xD
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane makes Meanwhile a cup of tea
<Blowdown> of all the things that are now infested with bronies, Guildwars2 does not seem to be one of those things

<Twi_Fi> alexxm: So I was shocked.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Blowdown: there was a conspiracy theory about geogre bush or bill clinton giving arms to bin laden that turned out to be tru
<alexxm> sorry Twi_Fi
<Invi> Blowdown what if you are agnostic about some?
<Blowdown> I'm agnostic about all
<Blowdown> and so is everyone else
*alexxm hugs Twi_Fi

<Bronysith> cachi01|FFXIII-2: FFVI and FFVII are best final fantasies.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Airpuff|Drawing: filly
<WallDives> Bronysith: FFT gets no love?
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> Bronysith: yeah i know
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: I'm gonna let you finish, but FFI was the best FF of all time!
<Dken2021> Bronysith that's not how you spell Final Fantasy IV
<WallDives> cause FFT was awesome. 12 was good, although gambits can go die.
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane grabs Airpuff|Drawing and seperates the grab between the,

<Bronysith> ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY choose between kefka and sephiroth
<Meanwhile> Yeah actually I never liked any FF.
<alexxm> we'll see about that Bronysith
<Bronysith> kefka
*Airpuff|Drawing giggles at Alicorn_Prince_Shane and takes the cookie before keeping on moving Sylandest around with magic
<Bronysith> KEFKA is best villain
<Dken2021> WallDives I liked that game on the dreamcast, if only I had a way to connect to the internet
<Meanwhile> I don't really like JRPG's.
<Bronysith> EVAER
*Sylandest dragged away by Airpuff|Drawing "Um...do I get any say here?" :$
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane levitates Airpuff|Drawing and put s him in candy mane
<WallDives> Dken2021: I mean the original tetrology. Phantasy Star 1-4.
<Bronysith> KEFKA IS THE MADDEST and best joker
<WallDives> not PSO, although I owned that.
<WallDives> Bronysith: Kefka is a good villian, Dark Falz is best villian.
<Bronysith> WallDives: oooh the hours i logged into that game
<Dken2021> oh
*Airpuff|Drawing keeps on moving Sylandest around with magic "No. You dont have a say"
<flutter_shy> yo
<Bronysith> WallDives: WRONG kefka destroys the world
<WallDives> Bronysith: Lv186 RAcast at server shutdown.
<Bronysith> flutter_shy: hi there
<Dken2021> what about Golbez? he's pretty much the final fantasy's Darth Vader!
<Meanwhile> In soviet russia, world destroys kefka
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Airpuff|Drawing: wittle Airpuff|Drawing wanna sleep?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol
<Dken2021> and darth vader's pretty cool
<flutter_shy> bronysith hi
*Airpuff|Drawing glares at Alicorn_Prince_Shane "No. Im playing now."
*DeathStar dances on Sylandest "hi Airpuff|Drawing "
<Bronysith> Dken2021: yes. but kefka is best video game villain
<Bronysith> DeathStar: what did panda say?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Airpuff|Drawing: play nice with Sylandest
<WallDives> Bronysith: Dark Falz destroyed 5 planets, was sealed, woke up after 1000 years, destroyed a star system, leading to another series over 4 games.
*Airpuff|Drawing waves at DeathStar "Hai"
<Sylandest> DeathStar: >.< why is everypony doing this to me? XD
<DeathStar> Bronysith: he hassn;t replied
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane hands a gun to Sylandest whispers ' just in case"
<WallDives> Bronysith: kefka is best FF villian, Dark Falz is better.
<Bronysith> WallDives: Kefka wanted to destroy the world cause he is incredibly bored
<Sylandest> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: one minute, im an anonymous pony, the next I'm everypony's plaything...*sigh*
<DeathStar> Sylandest: because we love you!
<Bronysith> WallDives: what game is dark falz froma gain?
<WallDives> Bronysith: Phantasy Star.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Sylandest: thats Airpuff|Drawing for u
<Sylandest> DeathStar: awwww :)
<Bronysith> WallDives: ooh yea
<Om> Sylandest: You werent the only one to get that treatment.
<flutter_shy> wat da video
*Airpuff|Drawing stares at Alicorn_Prince_Shane before setting up a protective barrier of wind around himself.... "Just in case".....
<WallDives> also, Phantasy Star predates FF.
<Princess_Molestia> alexxm: i am impressed
<WallDives> so, theres that.
<Sylandest> Om: true...but I seem the only one as of late, lol

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Meanwhile: im gonna love and tolerate the shit out of u
<Meanwhile> It isn't. And if folks don't knock it off they're going to get kicked into space.
<Om> Sylandest: Sure it does. Have fun now
<Bronysith> Princess_Molestia: could i plz go and play tf2 first?
*Airpuff|Drawing teleports to the top of Sylandest 's head and dances with DeathStar "Nope" before he giggles
<FlareChaser|TF2> Bronysith: but yeah, sure :|
<Princess_Molestia> fine Bronysith
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Meanwhile: theres 2 types of rp 1 shitz and gigglez 2 the srs wierd shit
<WallDives> Meanwhile: kicked quicker than John Terry from the national team.
<Sylandest> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: i have two ponies dancing on my head...I now sympathize with you and your mane usage...XD
*Princess_Molestia gets off Bronysith
<WallDives> zing!
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Meanwhile: and if u check the rule it says "Excessive"
*DeathStar dances with Airpuff|Drawing awww ok
<Meanwhile> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Neither of which are allowed in here in excess.
<Meanwhile> It's been going on for like half an hour -_-
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Sylandest: Airpuff|Drawing DeathStar lower the RP k
<DeathStar> Bronysith: he said yes
<Bronysith> DeathStar: aight whats ur skype name?
<Sylandest> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: sure thing, np :$ sorry if I bothered anypony
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Meanwhile: if so ur in the wrong place lol
*DeathStar lowers the rp
<Meanwhile> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: What?
<WallDives> I has no idea whats going on here..
*Airpuff|Drawing lowers rp and returns to drawing
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> see Meanwhile if u want to get something done u have to say it nicely
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> shouting only works if ur in the army
<Meanwhile> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Being nice isn't the point, the rules are.
<Princess_Molestia> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: would u kindly come over here
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> which we are obv not in
<WallDives> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: it also works if you're a coach.
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane runs away
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> dat too WallDives
<Sylandest> run, Alicorn_Prince_Shane, run!
<flutter_shy> your goind to love me :[ :P
<Sylandest> flutter_shy: we already love you, silly filly
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Meanwhile: stop being such a nanny calm da fuck down
<flutter_shy> :P
<WallDives> Sylandest: speak for yourself.
<Derpy_at_work> hai hai hai
<Meanwhile> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I'm perfectly calm, I just want the rules acknowledged.
<WallDives> hi Derpy_at_work.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Meanwhile: its called "fun"
<Meanwhile> The mods didn't put that list together so you could ignore them.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Meanwhile: remeber it says excessive rp
<Sylandest> WallDives: well, I do! I love everypony on here, without question
<Airpuff|Drawing> By the way Meanwhile if the mods dont tell us that we are crossing the line you have nothing to support us getting kicked to space. Just ask next time
<WallDives> Sylandest: lies, hearsay, and shenanigans, and you know it.
<Meanwhile> You will not win this argument.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> " Bronystate is not an RP channel, and as such, excessive Role-Playing is discouraged. "
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> see it says excessive
<prince-dari> Excessive being anything more than hugs generally.
<Meanwhile> And you've been more than excessive.
<Airpuff|Drawing> Meanwhile: There is nothing saying Rp isnt allowed to a certain degree
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> prince-dari: wut about cookies?
*WallDives sighs
<Sylandest> WallDives: no really, I do! Though shenanigans are fun...
<Meanwhile> And I've ignored you up until now Airpuff|Drawing.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Meanwhile: go twirl ur mustache someplace else
<prince-dari> Just use some discretion, if you guys want to RP, you can do it elsewhere
<WallDives> Sylandest: btw, its fun and funny as hell to yell that IRL.
<Meanwhile> I've been twirling my moustache in here for a year, and I will continue to twirl it here.
<Airpuff|Drawing> Meanwhile: Excessive is pointed more against roleplay that are against the ruels and might be and offence
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> prince-dari: Airpuff|Drawing gets out of hand
<Om> Meanwhile: Fight the power!
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> prince-dari: alot
<Sylandest> WallDives: Shenanigans? I do it at work when there's no customers and my co-workers are bored, hehe
<Airpuff|Drawing> lol
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> haha Sylandest
<Meanwhile> Airpuff|Drawing: Don't assume your interpretation of the rules is somehow more correct than mine.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Meanwhile: lighten up
<Airpuff|Drawing> Meanwhile: well i do, beacuse rp isnt against the rules
<WallDives> Sylandest: no, I mean yelling "LIES, HEARSAY AND SHENANIGANS!"
<Meanwhile> Do you not see dari's message up there? ^
<Sylandest> WallDives: oh, i see...I'll have to try that next time, lol
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Airpuff|Drawing: its excessive which u do sometimes
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Meanwhile: shuddup
<Wrek> 05close battle
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> this is obviously gonna turn into a shit storm
<Wrek> 05hate those wasps
<Meanwhile> It obviously won't if you just read the rules and follow them.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> so every shuddup and watch wrek
<Bronysith> Wrek: dont we all?
<Airpuff|Drawing> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: mind giving me an example then?
<Blowdown> I call leeroy jenkins on this situation
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Meanwhile: just watch the dam stream
<WallDives> Sylandest: hell, I did it yesterday after getting caught in a combo. "lies, this is all lies, lemons, more lies, hearsay and shenanigans!"
<Sylandest> go wrek go!
<Kid_Cobalt> Wrek: -lol- I thought they were fireflys. But yeah I deffinetly underestimated those bugs and got owned....a lot.
<Airpuff|Drawing> Meanwhile: We follow the rules that is why we can rp here, beacuse we dont cross the line.
<Sylandest> WallDives: you got caught in a combo? how does one do that?
<WallDives> Sylandest: play fighting games.
<Derpy_at_work> lawl, whatchyou streaming Wrek?
<WallDives> and screw up.
<Sylandest> WallDives: aaaahhhh, now i get it
<Om> Airpuff|Drawing: Yes it does cross the line at times
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> sometime Airpuff|Drawing it does
<Wrek> 05dispeys herkules
<Blowdown> Derpy_at_work: diablo3
<Kid_Cobalt> Derpy_at_work: omg...I love your name.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> eg just b4
<WallDives> Sylandest: where do you think I got the name from?
<Meanwhile> Airpuff|Drawing: Excessive rp is generally anything that goes beyond a brief exchange. Excessive is a dialogue and played out scenario.
<Sylandest> WallDives: I actually had no idea...some things slip by me, hehehe :$
<Airpuff|Drawing> Meanwhile: well its wierd the mods dont kick for that then Meanwhile
<prince-dari> Meanwhile is right in my opinion.
<WallDives> Sylandest: actually, NO ONE has caught it without me pointing it out.
<prince-dari> What constitutes excessive is at the discretion of the mod, and what he said fits that.
<Sylandest> WallDives: well, what does "walldives" mean then? I'm curious now
<Blowdown> some people notice it, but don't mind
<prince-dari> If you guys want to RP, why not take it to another channel, and not risk annoying mods and other members in here?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> i say its up to the streamer
<Airpuff|Drawing> prince-dari: okei so why dont you kick the excessive rpers then? If that is the limit? I dont get it. Either follow the rules full out, or dont have the rules at all if you're not gonna hit down at it
<Blowdown> it's up to both the streamer and the mods, Alicorn_Prince_Shane
<prince-dari> I'm not always around to see what you guys are doing.
<prince-dari> Or I would.
<Blowdown> the mods are here to keep this chat pleasant for all
<Meanwhile> Perhaps for the sake of these kinds of exchange that rule should be expanded upon.
<prince-dari> If you want, I can outright ban anyone I thin is being excessive
<Airpuff|Drawing> prince-dari: so was the rp we did earlyer excessive then? and why didnt you kick us as we we're doing an action?
<prince-dari> Then we won't have any repeat offenses.
<Airpuff|Drawing> prince-dari: that is redicolus outright baning people
<prince-dari> Because I've seen people kicked time and time again for excessive RP, and not take notice of it.
<Airpuff|Drawing> prince-dari: you have to give some sort of warning
<Derpy_at_work> thank you Blowdown, and thank you Kid_Cobalt :3
<prince-dari> We do, but you don't seem to be taking heed of it.
<Meanwhile> The mods don't have to give anything.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> tbh some people dont understand theres 2 kinds of RP first theres in for shitz and gigglez and theres the srs nonsense
<prince-dari> If you want to RP, do it elsewhere.
<Om> Airpuff|Drawing: You aren't helping your case any
<prince-dari> That's a warning.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Airpuff|Drawing: just shh
<Blowdown> Meanwhile: actually, yea, mods do have to give warnings
<alexxm> the cave of burrowing horror sounds like a pleasant place
<Meanwhile> According to whom.
<Meanwhile> They'll warn you out of courtesy
<Sylandest> alexxm: its quite nice, i vacationed there once
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Airpuff|Drawing: no point arguing with a mod
<Blowdown> Meanwhile: just because they're above us doesn't mean they have their own rules, they have to be fair when judging a situation
<Meanwhile> But this is their chat and they enforce the rules here at individual discretion.
<Airpuff|Drawing> prince-dari: lol so no excessive rping is an outright ban of rp? Is that what you are saying? you are not just bending the rules in your direction?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Airpuff|Drawing: u'll never win
<Om> alexxm: Good place to build a summer home
<prince-dari> Derpy_at_work is a op in a channel called #ponyroleplay - that is a channel specifically made for RP. If you want to RP do it in a channel such as that.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Airpuff|Drawing: just stop\
<alexxm> whats it like Om
<Airpuff|Drawing> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: just beacuse she is a mod i have no reason to just give up and no i wont. Im jsut talking my case here.
<Wrek> 05each and everytime someone RPs in here, i tell them to stop. they stop for 1-5 minutes and then they are back to doign it again
<prince-dari> I am a mod, I can enforce the rules however I see fit.
<Wrek> 05over and over
<Bronysith> forever
<Wrek> 05so its tehir own fault
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> righto Airpuff|Drawing but trust me no point aruging with a mod
<Blowdown> so you can in fact ban anyone that breaks a rule, immediatly, even if it's a minor offense?
<Wrek> 05Alicorn_Prince_Shane. there is a difference between arguign and discussing
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> i understand Airpuff|Drawing ur voicing u opinon
<Om> alexxm: Dark, sometimes quiet. And a bit musty. Neighbers don't bother you to much
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> note to myself: dont battle atlas in his full power mode
<Airpuff|Drawing> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: i have no reason to stop arguing with a mod if i feel it is right
<Blowdown> actually.. yea you do
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Wrek: im trying to say to Airpuff|Drawing hes not gonna get anything out of it
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ive learnt the hard way
<Airpuff|Drawing> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: if a mod can "enforce" the rules in ANY way they see fit it is redicolus. No matter the autority of the mod, they should follow the lines of the rules or else they might as well not have them at all.
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> why is everypony arguing?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> leave me out of this
<Blowdown> well
<prince-dari> Well put it this way Airpuff, you have been warned now, if I see you RPing here beyond what I view as acceptable, I will give you an hours ban.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> i dont want to piss the mods off
<Om> ded
<Sylandest> oh shiz, wrek died
<alexxm> ded
<Om> Them lazers get you alot wrek
<WallDives> LAZERS!
<Sylandest> cachi01|FFXIII-2: discussion of rules
<Blowdown> as soon as you break a rule, the mods are in their right to punish you for that, however immediatly banning for a minor offense isn't something a mod can just do... if they did they probably won't be mods for long
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> oh
<Blowdown> -if- you have been warned though, then it's just your fault
<prince-dari> If you are claiming to have read the rules Airpuff, you should also have read this: "These rules are subject to change or variation at staff discretion with or without prior notice. Disagreements or complaints should be handled in private messaging or via email"
<Airpuff|Drawing> prince-dari: so you will permanently make it a taboo to rp at all from what i hear. Which is rather wierd. but okei
<TheRandomkid321> I knaw on old car tyres. It helps strengthen my jaw incase of a bear attack.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol TheRandomkid321
<Om> Airpuff|Drawing: This will sound rude but. Shut up.
<WallDives> Seconded.
<alexxm> hey TheRandomkid321 hows your day been
<Blowdown> gonna have to agree with him there, you're argueing for the sake of argueing, not a good thing
<TheRandomkid321> SO who eb streamin?
<Blowdown> wrek is
<Meanwhile> Wrek be streaming.
<Airpuff|Drawing> Om: lol i dont care. If she dosent follow the bottom lines and take excessive rp ans rp in generall its redicolus -.-
<alexxm> Wrek is
<Kid_Cobalt> TheRandomkid321: Wreky :3

<Blowdown> Ninjazz: a big fight between two ninja factions?
<RaveBrony> Apparently the mad happened O.o
<Ninjazz> alexxm: Terrible.
<Wrek> 05the problem is when theres the "wingboner from touching exampledude1" and so on
<Wrek> 05you get the point
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: rough day, i take it?
<Gunthler|Xbox> lol
<Om> Airpuff|Drawing: Yes. You made it my problem, and I don't apriciate that.
<Meanwhile> Airpuff|Drawing your point is irrelevant, you've been given an ultimatum. You need to accept that.
<alexxm> how come Ninjazz
<Blowdown> Airpuff|Drawing: Note the rule that if you have a problem with the rules that you discuss these in PM's or emails
<valoreins> hey Airpuff|Drawing you have a DA account?
<WallDives> someone tell me when people are done playing pitchabitch.
<Ninjazz> Sylandest: Something like that...
<Blowdown> walldives never!
<Ninjazz> alexxm: Losing friends and stuff...

<Sylandest> Ninjazz: we're here for you, bud
<Gunthler|Xbox> Dat GilDash|Fajita

<Airpuff|Drawing> Lol all im saying is that its stupid to take rp as excessive itself.
<TheRandomkid321> my watch broke. NOW I HAVE A POCKET WATCH! but seriously I need a replacement. I have been looking into pocket watches. See if I can find a moderatly cheap one.
<Ninjazz> Thanks guys.
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane hugs Ninjazz

<WallDives> alexxm: above.
<Om> Airpuff|Drawing: Then shut up. It you would be so kind.
<Gunthler|Xbox> WallDives: Wasn't that much of a spam.
<Blowdown> Airpuff|Drawing: honestly, did you even listen to what has been said so far?:| no offense, but you're just making a fool out of yourself by this point
<Meanwhile> The point of this wasn't to be rude.
<Meanwhile> Knock it off.
*Claude Alicorn_Prince_Shane "Help me up pwease :3"
<Malavolent> Ello there, everypony.
<Airpuff|Drawing> Blowdown: I've heard all that has been said. All i am saying is taht it is bad for the mods to be able to bend and use the rules completely in their favor
*Gunthler|Xbox is bored of Xbox
<Meanwhile> Allo Malavolent.
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> hi Malavolent!
<WallDives> hi Malavolent.

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Claude: bad timing lol
<Om> Malavolent hola brosif
<Blowdown> Airpuff|Drawing: and it has been mentioned that if you have an issue with this, PM's and emails are the solution, not bickering in this chat

<Claude> Hia Meanwhile do you want a cookie *(/
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> TheRandomkid321: but shitloads f monsters

*Alicorn_Prince_Shane hugs Claude
<Meanwhile> No thanks Claude.
<TheRandomkid321> cachi NICE what is it?
<exampledude1> rofl
<Meanwhile> Hey FlareChaser|TF2 you alive?
<Blowdown> I haven't reacted to your case, I'm mostly pointing out that what you're doing right now is -not- the solution to your problem
<WallDives> whatever. I'm not having any of this. get me when things cool down.
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> TheRandomkid321: worstseedever
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> TheRandomkid321: no joke thats the seed xD
<Om> WallDives: Or we could change the subject
<Airpuff|Drawing> Blowdown: The only reason im still going is beacuse some people in here are being assholes and are taunting me to keep going saying that my case and arguments are shit. That is why i am angry. If you cant argue with someone without going for a personal insults. dont comment at all
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> TheRandomkid321: and its pretty cool
<TheRandomkid321> >:/
<TheRandomkid321> Ok then
<Claude> Meanwhile why you no ant cookie
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> TheRandomkid321: there will be a pit with sand and rocks infront of you
<Airpuff|Drawing> That will be my final word in the matter.
<TheRandomkid321> Try fluttershy. On the PC edition it used to e a crescent moon shaped island with a single tree on it.
<drf|away-SchoolPC> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow

<Wrek> 05TheRandomkid321: yes. look up aleph one
<alexxm> story of the blanks Malavolent?
<TheRandomkid321> alexxm I- I dont know
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> Malavolent: luna game and dreamy rainbow those are creepy
<Meanwhile> Story of the Blanks. I quite liked that.
<Wrek> 05at source.bungie.org TheRandomkid321
<Malavolent> cachi01|FFXIII-2: Those are both games?
<Ninjazz> cachi01|FFXIII-2: Those arn't even games... Just screamers.
<Malavolent> alexxm: Yep, it's a pony game.
<alexxm> i thought it was a bit too short Malavolent
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> Ninjazz: luna game 0 and 4 are games
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> dreamy rainbow 3 also is a game
<Ninjazz> cachi01|FFXIII-2: Hardly...
<TheRandomkid321> Where have I heared this song before?
<Blowdown> I'm hesistant of looking at "creepy" pony things since last time :'(
<Malavolent> alexxm: Yeah, it is but it's still pretty neat.
<Ninjazz> Good idea, Blowdown. Just no natural...
<alexxm> what did you see last time Blowdown
<Om> Ninjazz: Aye its a bit creepy.
<Ninjazz> a bit? :$
<Gunthler> Theres a pony coming right at me o_o
<alexxm> Malavolent i have a theory at cutie pox is connected to what happened i story of the blanks
<Meanwhile> Hug it Gunthler
<Om> Ninjazz: Only a bit
<Malavolent> alexxm: What is cutie pox?
<Ninjazz> What would consider alot? :$
<Om> Ninjazz: 30bits
<Ninjazz> lol
<Gunthler> I found Rainbow Dash :3
<alexxm> that thing applebloom got when she tried to get a cutie pox from a potion Malavolent
<Ninjazz> You crazy, Om.
<pyrocatboy> -pushes Meanwhile- Bother!
<Ninjazz> :$
<Om> Ninjazz: but I wont pay more than 10
<Meanwhile> I am Meanwhile, the potions master.
<Malavolent> alexxm: Oh yeah, that disease.
<Malavolent> alexxm: How are these two things connected then?
<Ninjazz> Om: How come? :S
<TheRandomkid321> brb
<pyrocatboy> Meanwhile : Lets have a beach party! IN LONDON!
<Om> Meanwhile, at the potion masters. Are heroes-
<Meanwhile> There are no beaches in London.
<Om> Ninjazz: I'm broke xD
<Meanwhile> Plus, I hate London.
<Meanwhile> Everything is too large. And grey. And fast. And not green.
<Om> Yes, green is good.
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> my story of blanks theory: long log time ago ponie without cutie mark at an mature age were considered as useless so they got banished they created a town and killed everypony that had a cutie mark (u know the ornge pony that is good at finding things) the town then turned into a ghost town tormenting everypony that found it :)
<Ninjazz> o_o
<Ninjazz> Okay....
<Meanwhile> Dat wall of theory.
<pyrocatboy> Om : Greed is good.
<Om> pyrocatboy: Greed is fake.
<Malavolent> cachi01|FFXIII-2: I've read what the story of the game should be. I can PM it to you, if you want.
<pyrocatboy> Om : So greed is cake.
<alexxm> Malavolent Fear of a Cutie Pox outbreak is theorized to be the cause of Sunnytown's paranoia toward Cutie Marks.
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> Malavolent: sure :)
<Om> pyrocatboy: only if a psycopathic robot promises it to you.
<Woodenfan> still playing diablo 3?
<cachi01|FFXIII-2> FUUUUU ATLAS IS REALLY PISSING ME OFF
<Malavolent> alexxm: Cutie Pox isn't contagious, is it?
<Woodenfan> Malavolent: Don't think so.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> hmm its 230 am here should i go to sleep
<pyrocatboy> Follow the butterflys. Follow the butterflys. Whee! la-la-la
<Om> Malavolent: Bet it tastes delicous.
<Woodenfan> yeah Alicorn, do so.
<alexxm> we don't know if it is or not and conserding the town didn't seem to know what a cutie mark was Malavolent they wouldn't either
<Woodenfan> Wait, where do you live alicorn? It's 12:30 PM here! :s
<Woodenfan> In China or something? :p
<Malavolent> alexxm: Yeah, that makes sense.
<Malavolent> There should be a fanfic about this.
<Ninjazz> Story of the Blanks? :S
*pyrocatboy drinks expired gorilla milk.
<Malavolent> Yep
<Ninjazz> I was under the assumption that it ALREADY was a fanfic. :S
<Malavolent> It is?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> eww pyrocatboy
<Ninjazz> I don't know... I only heard about it after we just got changelings canon. They tried to make similarities and stuff... :S
<WallDives> I see things have cooled down.
<Meanwhile> I think Story of the Blanks is originally part of the halloween creepypasta stuff.

<N4X> thats a great thing to hear alexxm
<WallDives> GilDash: please, dont kick this up again...
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Well... We sung... Waited... Then when she gave her speech and stuff we were already kinda... emotional. Then she started doing names, you know? Then she named me and one particular quote just made my ears water cause I already was feeling so crappy. Once a brother always a brother... I just kinda... didn't have words for a while.
<Om> I CANT Seeee!
<GilDash> Airpuff|Drawing, Alicorn_Prince_Shane: It's a really easy system. Obey the mods. There is no argument. :)
<WallDives> Om: open your EYES!

<N4X> Ohhh
<GilDash> Om: Yeah, you're *real* slow today. :D
<Airpuff|Drawing> GilDash: I understand that you have to obey the mods, which i did, but i have no intention of... nevermind. I wont take it here.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Everything hits you in a soft part. ;)
<DitzyHooves> I do commissions if anypony wants any
<Om> GilDash: Don't have to point it out again :(
*GilDash hugs Ninjazz.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz: has a soft spot NOOOOOOO
<GilDash> Airpuff|Drawing: PM me if it's that important.
<Meanwhile> The soft spot. If you know what I mean.

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Meanwhile: DILIGAF
<Meanwhile> Yeah you kinda do.
<GilDash> Airpuff|Drawing: It's the simplest solution. And the technically correct one.
<Airpuff|Drawing> GilDash: I guess. but all rules and communities must have room for change. Just not all who understand that -.-
<WallDives> get me when this is over...agian.
<WallDives> again^
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I'm just saying that this entire year I just didn't do what I should have done.
<Om> WallDives: Will do!
<Om> If i remember ._.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Eight years baby. At least you know now. :D
<Meanwhile> ALL the whirlwind mobs!
<Om> Ninjazz: Huray for insight! albeit late...
<Airpuff|Drawing> Om WallDives no reason to be rude.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I guess so... :S
<GilDash> Ninjazz: You'll be fine. :)
<Om> Airpuff|Drawing: Don't interperate it as rude. :)
<Ninjazz> interpret*
<WallDives> Airpuff|Drawing: I'm not being rude. I just dont care for rule arguments. I deal enough with that IRL.
<Om> Thank you!
<Sylandest1> GilDash: you and me will have to look after him for a time
<Skydroid> :<
<Woodenfan> never mind can't do it
<WallDives> if it comes off as rude, sorry you're offended.
<Airpuff|Drawing> WallDives: well dont coem and join the discussion at all and start a personal assault on me then.
<GilDash> Sylandest1: I look after *everypony.* ;)
*GilDash hugs Ninjazz.
<Airpuff|Drawing> WallDives: And yes, you did assault me personally.
<Sylandest1> GilDash: don't I know it...hehe :$
<Om> WallDives: Get back in your box its not over yet!
<WallDives> Airpuff|Drawing: dont know how, but whatever, sorry.
<Ninjazz> Thank you...
<MadSurge> :S I just hope we'll switch back to the other stream client soon, because LimeV is completely dead to me...
<Airpuff|Drawing> WallDives: No problem.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh lawl at EQD
<Om> Airpuff|Drawing: Can I insult you again? If thats alright.
<GilDash> Sylandest1: Oh, I think you've yet to find out exactly how comforting I can be. ;)
<DitzyHooves> i do stuff like OC chubbies ($10), oc pony ($15), pony fashion($15), ponified song lyrics ($10)...
<Airpuff|Drawing> Om: What?
<Woodenfan> i'll be back later gonna get some groceries
<CrimsonPhoenix> ponified song lyrics?
<Om> Airpuff|Drawing: I'm saking if I can insult you as to not be rude. Cuse you are so sensative.
<Sylandest1> GilDash: meep!
<N4X> I always wondered: Derpys "real name" is Dity doo,and she's a pegasus...And if,(!)IF(!) Daring doo wasn't just a ponytale...are they somehow related?
<GilDash> Om: ~Chocolate sauce!~
<Airpuff|Drawing> Om: Why do you want to insult me?
<Meanwhile> Derpy's real name is Derpy nowadays N4X.
<Om> Airpuff|Drawing: Can I?
<DitzyHooves> I have a better headcanon that fixes that problem, wanna hear it?
<Airpuff|Drawing> Om: Sure go ahead, but its at own risk
<GilDash> Om: ~Lots of chocolate sauce!~
<Meanwhile> No/
<Om> Airpuff|Drawing: I don't like your ideas, RP if you want but you will take the consiquencess. What you drawing?
<Om> GilDash: DISREGARD CHOCOLATE AQUIRE ALLCAPS!
<DitzyHooves> Cutecenaras are renaming ceremonies
<GilDash> Om: ~CHOCOLATE SAUCE THEN!~
<Airpuff|Drawing> Om: Thats not an insult, you are simply giving your opinion of Rp.
<flutter_shy> ...... :P
<Airpuff|Drawing> Om: and im drawing Lyra
<Fluttershy12343> Streaming?
<Om> Airpuff|Drawing: Fun~
<Fluttershy12343> xd
<N4X> Well Meanwhile : In Winter Wrap up she was mentioned as Ditzy,so I guess "Derpy" is just some kind of Nickname.Because cmon! Derpy? I love the name but given by the parents?!
<DitzyHooves> at a cutecenara a pony can choose to pick a new name, most pick one related to their cutie mark
<Airpuff|Drawing> Om: Yep :P
<DitzyHooves> which is why so many have names related to their cutie marks.
<GilDash> Airpuff|Drawing: What's Lyra doing? ;)
<Meanwhile> N4X: No confirmation on whether or not the referred to "Ditzy Doo" was actually Derpy though.
<Om> GilDash: Empty threats.
<Airpuff|Drawing> GilDash: Smiling shyly x)
*GilDash hovers chocolate sauce over Om.
<GilDash> Om: Oh really? ;)
<Om> GilDash: Yes.
<GilDash> Airpuff|Drawing: Why, have I just hit on her? :D
<DitzyHooves> She used to go by one name and at her Cutecenara she changed it to the other. But ponies still sometimes call her by her old name
<Airpuff|Drawing> GilDash: Nope xD
*GilDash drops chocolate sauce on Om.
<GilDash> Om: Told ya. ;)
<Blowdown> DitzyHooves: decent, however it does not explain why the ponies that are shown before they get their cutiemark already have their name (aka twilight sparkle, pinkie pie, RD... etc etc
<GilDash> Airpuff|Drawing: Yeah, it'd be terrified smile otherwise. :D
<CK|Ded> No confirmation except "that clearly was her name and anyone saying otherwise is creating an illusory world for themselves", that is.
<Om> GilDash: That's nice. I'm glad you had so much fun.
<GilDash> Om: You're covered in chocolate sauce....
<Airpuff|Drawing> ahahaha GilDash xD
<Om> GilDash: That I am.
<GilDash> Om: You look delicious...
<Meanwhile> CK|Ded: Yeah that sounds real compelling.
<CK|Ded> If it weren't so very clearly denying logic I might even like that idea, but yeah.
<Om> GilDash: That I do.
<GilDash> Om: I've yet to have a dessert...
*Om rolls around in the dirt and makes me gusta face
<Blowdown> Also, unless I'm mistaken, which is quite possible, I do believe ditzy doo hasn't been actually adressed to being the one we call derpy, it was just assumed. There is no mention in the show that actually attaches the name to the face
<CK|Ded> Meanwhile: It's somewhat more compelling than pretending they're different ponies with absolutely no form of evidence beyond the willing suspension of disbelief.
<DitzyHooves> the writer confirmed that she IS the same pony
<GilDash> Om: ... You really think that's going to stop me. I've eaten worse. ;)
<Meanwhile> CK|Ded: That and the fact that Derpy is referred to as "Derpy" on screen.
<N4X> Meanwhile : When "The Last Roundup" was censored: We got a decleration of one of the creaters (Don't know which right now) and It refers to "Ditzy" was changed to "Derpy" by order from one of the producers I think. Also in Winter Wrap up : Only Derpy would fly north instead of south 2 years in a row...or would anypony else?
<Meanwhile> CK|Ded: Who's the one with the suspension of disbelief here exactly
<Blowdown> DitzyHooves: it is, and we know it, however in the show it hasn't been mentioned once
<Om> GilDash: What? That was for pleasure value! ALLCAPS!
<CK|Ded> Meanwhile: Still you.
<Blowdown> so in fact, following show logics, ditzy doo can be a completly different pony
*GilDash noms Om's chocolate covered body.
<DitzyHooves> Ditzy Doo was mentioned first. -during winter wrap up
<Blowdown> she was mentioned
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> dinky?
<Meanwhile> Mentioned, never IDd.
<Blowdown> however no face was attached to the name, not show wise atleast
<Om> GilDash: Say that ten times fast.
<Gunthler> it didn't show her tho
<GilDash> Om: Too busy licking right now. ;)
<DitzyHooves> actually from show canon, dinky probably isn't derpy's daughter
<Om> GilDash: Doooo eeeeet
<CK|Ded> No, not really. XD There is zero evidence in the show that they are different ponies except this comical asspull of "well you don't see them both in the same frame at the same time so obviously they're different"
<DitzyHooves> she's more likely carrot top's
<Meanwhile> CK|Ded: That same logic beats your argument.
<GilDash> Om: When you're all nice and clean maybe.
<CK|Ded> It's a fan theory that has zero weight behind it.
<DitzyHooves> what's a fan theory?
<Om> GilDash: Fine. Hury it up then, we have toung twisters to say!
<DitzyHooves> that Dinky is Derpy's daughter?
<Meanwhile> There's zero evidence that they're the same pony besides "Well Ditzy Doo is apprently a bit dense, and so is Derpy, therefore Ditzy = Deryp"
<N4X> Maybe
<Blowdown> The plan was that the crosseyed pony we all know and love was going to be named ditzy
<N4X> Well it's kind of a fan thing too
<Blowdown> However, from purely watching the show, there is not a single piece of evidence that Ditzy = derpy
<DitzyHooves> how bout we just call her Derpy Ditzianne Doo
<CK|Ded> Meanwhile: Except for the writers kind of admitting that they changed the name. :p
<GilDash> Om: Oh, I've got some far more interesting things to twist my tongue around. ;)
<N4X> Meanwhile : The Evidence they are the same is : The Name was changed from Ditzy to derpy in TLR !
<Meanwhile> CK|Ded: So they changed the name, meaning that Derpy isn't Ditzy.
<DitzyHooves> she marries the DOCTOR thus her last name becomes Hooves, thus Derpy Hooves
<Om> GilDash: Thats just creepy.
<GilDash> Om: Creepy for some, kinky for others. ;)
<Blowdown> you're not getting the point I'm trying to adress
<N4X> SO Ditzy=Derpy...I think
<CK|Ded> Meanwhile: That's a fantastic fantasy you live in.
<Blowdown> from writers point of view, they were the same pony
<N4X> But...?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ditzy = derpy
<Om> GilDash: Okay. Compromise then. You are creepy.
<Blowdown> however, from show point of view, they never have shown the cross eyed pony to be ditzy
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> there were going inital gonna call her Ditzy
<GilDash> Om: That's not a compromise. ;)
<Blowdown> they were
<DitzyHooves> another thing about the cutecenara naming ceremony is Diamond Tiara
<Meanwhile> What you are attemoting to establish is that Ditzy and Derpy are both one pony, but apparently they aren't. Because canonically a Ditzy Doo and a Derpy have both been established, ergo, they aren't the same individual.
<CK|Ded> They're clearly the exact same pony. It would make a lot more sense to claim "Derpy" is a nickname for Ditzy, given show context.
<Ninjazz> Does anyone know anything for a sour stomach? :S
<DitzyHooves> shouldn't her name be Diamond Rich?
<Ninjazz> Anything good I meant.
<Om> GilDash: Its not? I have been lied to. I blame Ninjazz
<SonicTheStallion> There is no end to the skydive through clouds in LOZ: Skyward Sword, it's like the world is made of clouds :3
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Alkalines. :)
<Ninjazz> Om: :(
<Bronysith> im back
<Blowdown> CK|Ded: unlikely, if they called her derpy they would have done so in the winter wrap up episode too
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Can we use kitchen names? :$
<Om> for being a nice person
<GilDash> Om: You should be taking your lessons from me, not him. ;)
<Blowdown> not completly impossible, ofcourse
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Base. :D
<CK|Ded> Blowdown: Except now you're mixing IC and OOC contextx.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Chalk?
<CK|Ded> *Contexts
<DitzyHooves> I'm gonna say her name before she renamed it at her cutcenara was Spoilt Rich and changed it to Diamond Tiara
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Not helping! :D
<Meanwhile> What you are attemoting to establish is that Ditzy and Derpy are both one pony, but apparently they aren't. Because canonically a Ditzy Doo and a Derpy have both been established, ergo, they aren't the same individual.
<Om> GilDash: Jealous?
<MadSurge> DitzyHooves: then Shining Armor's name should be Shining Sparkle
<Blowdown> I'm taking it literal here, IC Ditzy is not derpy, period
<Blowdown> ooc clearly ditzy is derpy
<GilDash> Ninjazz: How about some bicarbonate of soda?
<Sylandest1> GilDash: i walk away for two minutes and i come back to this. What did you do?
<DitzyHooves> no, at the cutecenara, they can change their names
<GilDash> Om: Me? How the hay could I get jealous with all my numbers? ;)
<Blowdown> If we all agree from show point of view that ditzy magically changed name, that's just silly and working around the point
<WallDives|Unlikable> Sylandest1: I dont know what the hell happened.
<GilDash> Sylandest1: Interacted. :)
<N4X> But the Hay what is up with the Bubbles after all?!
<CK|Ded> Um, no, the two aren't completely different answers. If, OOC, the writers say "they are the same", that doesn't mean that IC they aren't. In fact it means the exact opposite.
<Om> GilDash: I dunno? Why don't you explain how?
<Blowdown> It's not impossible, just highly improbable
<Sylandest1> GilDash: so thats what you call it, lol
<DitzyHooves> Cutecenara renaming ceremony is a reasonable conclusion
<MadSurge> Blowdown: What does "derpy" even mean in proper english? Clearly Ditzy/Derpy is not "derpy" :D
<GilDash> Om: I just said I don't know. I think it's an impossibility. :D
<Meanwhile> CK|Ded: Wrong. Anything on the drawing board cannot be set as canon until implemented as such.
<Bronysith> http://derpy.me/lPSe6
<Blowdown> MadSurge: derpy is not proper english, as far as I know
<DitzyHooves> its like getting a new name when a person becomes an adult.
<GilDash> Sylandest1: It's a form of interaction unique to me. ;)
<DitzyHooves> they do that in some cultures
<Om> GilDash: Improbability, havent you seen Hitchickers?
<Blowdown> and I don't feel like I'm getting my point across
<Sylandest1> alrighty, everypony, I'm stepping out to get some exersise. I'll be back in an hour or so. Ya'll be good now! GilDash, behave while I'm gone
<Blowdown> oh well, it doesn't matter
<Meanwhile> Canon says a Ditzy Doo and a Derpy exist, therefore, two ponies.
<CK|Ded> Meanwhile: I'm pretty sure the writers of the show know better than a few of the show's fans what the reality of the world is.
<WallDives|Unlikable> bye Sylandest1.
<GilDash> Om: You have an infinite imporbabilty drive? :O
<Airpuff|Drawing> Grr Bronysith thats the 4th pirate today xD
<Ninjazz> Cya Sylandest1.
<Meanwhile> CK|Ded:
<Om> GilDash: I am one!
<N4X> Derp is a neologism that was established by several movies,shows such as Southpark
<Meanwhile> Stupid enter key.
<Sylandest1> WallDives|Unlikable: oh, by the way walldives, you're not unlikeable. I like you :)
<GilDash> Sylandest1: Can't promise anything. ;)
<Blowdown> CK|Ded: we understand what you're trying to say
<MadSurge> Blowdown: exactly, so the claims of her being offensive are dumb :D
<N4X> Meanwhile : Canon says? Can I read that somewhere?
*Sylandest1 hugs Ninjazz, GilDash, and WallDives|Unlikable
<Ninjazz> Oi, WallDives|Unlikable. That tag is a lie.
<DitzyHooves> "At birth, a samurai was given a name by which he would be known until his coming of age ceremony."
<GilDash> Om: If infinite imporbability... and it's improbable you and me... ;)
<Bronysith> Ninjazz: would u like to see my oc
*GilDash hugs Sylandest1.
<Blowdown> MadSurge: spongebob squarepants is a good example why the claims are dumb
<Ninjazz> Sure, Bronysith.
<Om> GilDash: Aye.
<Meanwhile> N4X: If you watch winter wrap up, we have a named Ditzy Doo. And the legendary overshadowed Applejack episode names Derpy. Two names, two ponies.
<CK|Ded> Blowdown: Apparently not, if you're still insisting that reality isn't reality. If the writers say this is how it is and are not lying (and there's no reason to assume they are), that's Word of God and trumps IC canon.
<flutter_shy> pinie pie is staring at me though the tv
<WallDives> the tag is moreso for the mail I receive on a near-daily basis.
<GilDash> Om: So, you could speed things up between us. ;)
<Om> GilDash: Nope.
<Blowdown> CK|Ded: listen, I understand what you're trying to say and I believe you're wrong
<Kandarihu> Are we talking about Derpy Hooves again?
<Blowdown> CK|Ded: however, we both aren't able to convince the other, and we both believe we are right
<MadSurge> Blowdown: yep, everyone in that show is dumb as a brick and they're not considered "offensive"
<CK|Ded> Much like if George Lucas said "this happens in Star Wars", then it happened, regardless of IC canoncity of it. No matter how stupid it sounds.
<Meanwhile> 'Fraid so Kandarihu.
<N4X> Meanwhile : Never thought that "Derpy" could be a Nickname for Ditzy? Because shes just so...clumsy
<Blowdown> CK|Ded: this discussion is therefor tedious and not usefull, so lets stop it
<Om> GilDash: It only workds when i have no idea what I am doing.
<Meanwhile> N4X: There's no reason to assume that's the case. That's an entirely fanon interpretation.
<Blowdown> CK|Ded: lets just believe whatever we like to believe and enjoy the show
<alexxm> Alicorn_Prince_Shane bring me your finest wenches
<GilDash> Om: I'm pretty sure I can take you to that state. ;)
<thisguy> not to mention she's also cute and cuddly :P
<Om> GilDash: Not when i am on a drawing high.
<Airpuff|Drawing> Lol ditzy is Derpy..
<Airpuff|Drawing> No arguing that
<N4X> Meanwhile : I totally don't want to argue but you have a kind of Black/White view on this
<Blowdown> and I do feel that should go for the rest of you too, N4X / Meanwhile and some other people that were argueing about it.
<MadSurge> Blowdown: Derpy is still Derpy to the fandom anyway, and Ditzy Doo isn't that bad of an "official" name :D
<CK|Ded> Airpuff: Apparently there is. >_>
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane gives DeathStar to alexxm
<GilDash> Om: You're actually in a good mood...? :O
<Dan> Hey alexxm :) how was the report on bronies?
<Meanwhile> Fanon has absolutely no bearing on canon material, and it never will.
<DitzyHooves> what do you guys think of that headcanon?
<Om> GilDash: Weird, I know!
<Blowdown> MadSurge: I don't dislike ditzy, it's a fine name
<Kandarihu> Well, the whole franchise of Squarepants runs on nonsense. Derpy Hooves is popularly characterized as a dimwitted klutz. But I do understand how this can be offensive to those sensitive to the mentally disabled.
<DitzyHooves> it fits nicely
*GilDash hugs Om. :)
<WallDives> I think Om took my good mood.
<DitzyHooves> I am not an idiot
<DeathStar> alexxm: hi
<GilDash> WallDives: Would you like some good mood? ;)
<Om> WallDives: Did you want it back?
<N4X> Well Blowdown : I guess you are right,but I think it's enjoyable to talk about Ponies on a Brony chat....isn't it?
<MadSurge> Blowdown: hear hear.
<alexxm> hey DeathStar hows your day been
<Airpuff|Drawing> MadSurge: Well.. Why dont you just call Ditzy Doo, Derpy then? =S I mean.. It is the same pony. Whatever you call her she is the same pony..
<Om> What they hay?
<DitzyHooves> I just act silly to cheer up other ponies, I thought everypony knew that
<WallDives> Om: considering how horrible things go when i'm in a good mood, its probably better I dont.
*Om hugs GilDash "you only get this one:
<DeathStar> alexxm: ok
<GilDash> Om: ... :O
<Ninjazz> ...
<Ninjazz> No freakin
<Blowdown> Kandarihu: fair enough, however basing a whole franchise off of retarded people(not my choice of words, I'm aiming at your "soccermoms") still is a lot worse than derpy
<Ninjazz> way
<WallDives> Om is cracking. lawl.
<DitzyHooves> if somepony gets a sad letter, I cheer them up by acting silly
<GilDash> Om: Are you okay? Feeling ill? Do you need to lie down? :O
<N4X> I know DitzyHooves ...I know It's just unfair :(
<Om> GilDash: IM INVINCIBLE!
<MadSurge> Airpuff: but I do call her both Derpy and Ditzy, she's still an adorable clumsy pony :D
<Kaworu> hey
<WallDives> hi Kaworu.
<Kaworu> lolz
<Blowdown> N4X: I agree I enjoy discussing ponies, but this discussion is going nowhere
<GilDash> Om... actually hugged... me... *squee*
<Kaworu> i was scared before
<Meanwhile> According to Faust the name has apparently settled on Derpy Hooves, which in terms of canon material would make Ditzy Doo a different pony.
<Blowdown> and that's a shame
<Kandarihu> Yeah, Blowdown. Derpy > Spongebob.
<Ninjazz> Hello Kaworu
<Kaworu> i was banned from the server
<GilDash> Kaworu: Naughty boy. ;)
<Om> Ninjazz: Boo!
<alexxm> why Kaworu
<Ninjazz> Argh!
<DitzyHooves> Crackle's a guy right?
<Ninjazz> why you do this, Om?
<Kaworu> the usual things...
<Kaworu> the banned ip
<DitzyHooves> he's kinda cute
<N4X> Blowdown: Wait a minute
<Blowdown> crackle's a... uumh
<Om> Ninjazz: Cuse.
<Blowdown> something!
<Kaworu> to prevent abuse
<GilDash> Ninjazz: If you're feeling jealous... ;)
*alexxm hugs GilDash
<Kaworu> and protect the server
<CK|Ded> Meanwhile: No, that is misinterpretation of the writer's intentions just to satisfy the ridiculous notion that they are two identical-in-appearance ponies. >_>
*GilDash hugs alexxm.
<Blowdown> n4x a whole minute? gee you're demanding:D
<Ninjazz> Om: The worst kind of reason... :|
<DitzyHooves> but if you ship me with Hayseed turnip truck, you are going to pay
<Om> Ninjazz: Aint it tho?
<Kaworu> but i took out internet key and replugged it...ANOTHER IP
<SirGanjalf> Kandarihu: dimwitted klutz = sound pretty much like Snails for me;)
<Kaworu> i trolled the dns blacklist
<Blowdown> CK|Ded: Meanwhile please guys, let's stop this useless discussion:)
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Yes, dammit. I feel like crap and my damn stomach is making me feel worse.
*GilDash holds Ninjazz and kisses his cheek.
<Ninjazz> Om: Yes. It is.
<Blowdown> let's just all believe what we like to believe, and ENJOY PONIES
<Meanwhile> CK|Ded: Ditzy Doo was a moniker that may have been Derpy's name at one point, but that is no longer the case. She has been given a name and what may have been is irrelevant.
<Om> GilDash: Are you laying down? Try drinking somethin
<GilDash> Ninjazz: There, there... :(
<Ninjazz> >///o
<CK|Ded> If the writer has said that the character formerly known as Ditzy is now Derpy, the correct interpretation of this statement is "same pony". You're free to keep believing something else, but that is not how the writers said it.
<Om> GilDash: Lol that was for Ninjazz
<SirGanjalf> *to me
<GilDash> Om: I'd much rather you just lie on top of me. ;)
<CK|Ded> Regardless, it's an incredibly dumb thing to argue about.
<Ninjazz> Om: No. Just sitting on my damn wheel chair stool.
<N4X> CK|Ded Thank you !
<Om> GilDash: Hmm, sounds like a sugjestion. Sooooo NO!
<Blowdown> guys, stop textwalling with no new relevant information
<Meanwhile> CK|Ded: Which is the words of someone who knows he's lost but is determined to be stubborn about it.
<Blowdown> you're just repeating yourself now
<Kaworu> see u later guys sry
<Kaworu> i was happy
<GilDash> Om: I was telling, not asking. ;)
<Om> Ninjazz: Lay down and get sum soda!
<Ninjazz> Om: I has no soda. :(
<Om> GilDash: No you werent.
<Om> Ninjazz: Go get some!
<CK|Ded> Meanwhile: Now you're just trolling. But I'm not five years old so I'm not going to bite. Sorry to disappoint you.
<Bronysith> Blowdown: wat?
<Ninjazz> Om: It's 3:06 in the morning! :(
<Meanwhile> CK|Ded: You mean you weren't trolling me with literally everything you said?
<Airpuff|Drawing> CK|Ded: Ditzy = Derpy Is all i say :)
<pipsqueakthepirate> ok, this chat doesn't like me, I'm blowdown and my name is already in use
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Aw, go to fucking sleep already. :D
<thisguy> eep. friendship problem. i wish twilight were here. this is her specialty >.<
<Om> Ninjazz: I see no problem.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz: /)
<cachi01> hi guys im back.....so why is Meanwhile and CK|Ded fighting?
<GilDash> Om: Want to test that theory. ;)
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I just took a nap. :$
<Ninjazz> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: (\
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz: u live in aus?
<GilDash> Ninjazz: It's 3 in the morning. GO TO SLEEP!
<Ninjazz> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Close to it.
<CK|Ded> Fighting? Nonono, I was explaining, Meanwhile is fighting. So now I'm just not responding. :p
<alexxm> hey cachi01 what have you been up to
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> miconesia?
<Ninjazz> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Eyup.
<pipsqueakthepirate> just for reference, I'm the same guy that told you to stop argueing, not some random new dood
<CK|Ded> Also why are two ponies apparently making out in the middle of chat
<CK|Ded> ?
<Om> GilDash: I just did the results were, your moma so fat she needs a swiming pool to wash her socks
<cachi01> alexxm: hi! umm nothing lately lol
<Meanwhile> I'm not fighting, I'm explaining 'accurately with actual information'
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> CK|Ded: lol wut
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I don't feel sleepy, so, no. :P
<pipsqueakthepirate> you were both argueing, and long overdue too
<GilDash> Om: Good job I fell far from the tree then. ;)
<pipsqueakthepirate> let's drop the issue and discuss applejack, which is clearly best pony
<Om> GilDash: Science is power!
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I'd like you to go to bed anyway. ;)
<Airpuff|Drawing> pipsqueakthepirate: there is no overdue* to a discussion xDD
<Meanwhile> Pinkie Pie is best pony.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> pfft accurate is a exxageration
<cachi01> PINKIE PIE IS BEST PONY
<Om> Ninjazz: Dooo et.
<pipsqueakthepirate> Airpuff|Drawing: yes, there is
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Then I'd miss all the fun... :(
<CK|Ded> I distinctly recall seeing people talking about making out "things" during that whole discussion. :|
<alexxm> Meanwhile bring me your finest wenches
<cachi01> :o <---- u cant argue with her
<pipsqueakthepirate> Airpuff|Drawing: the point where people are not bringing new arguements to a discussion is where the discussion is overdue
<CK|Ded> pipspeakthepirate: Nonsense, it takes two to argue.
<Airpuff|Drawing> pipsqueakthepirate: It is when the arguments start getting pointless. I agree then. But not any clear line
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Tsk, that's where the real fun begins, silly. ;)
<GilDash> Om: Science... you're starting to sound like pony_zen now... ;)
<Meanwhile> I apologise CK|Ded I got rather gung ho in that and it was uncharacteristically unpleasant of me.
<pipsqueakthepirate> Airpuff|Drawing: the arguements were pointless for quite some time already, whatever the line is, they crossed it big time
<Om> GilDash: Who?
<Airpuff|Drawing> pipsqueakthepirate: ah they've reached that point. Then i agree xD
<CK|Ded> pipspeakthepirate: And reiteration of a point not being listened to is not an argument, it's reiteration. An argument would require going further than that.
<GilDash> Om: Another number of mine. ;)
<N4X> Okay guys sorry for starting this fluff...how did we even got here I...I just don't know what went wrong
<Ninjazz> Om: I've met him.
<Om> GilDash: Ohhh, what color is he.
<Om> GilDash: Or she
<GilDash> Om: Actually, that's a lie. Not a number. A *name.*
<Om> GilDash: or it liek you
<pipsqueakthepirate> CK|Ded: I already told you, I see what you're trying to say, and I do believe so does meanwhile
*GilDash kisses om.
<CK|Ded> I get into plenty of arguments so I know the difference. :P
<CK|Ded> See?
<CK|Ded> Ponies making out in chat.
<CK|Ded> I wasn't just imagining that.
<Meanwhile> I apologise CK|Ded I got rather gung ho in that and it was uncharacteristically unpleasant of me.
<Om> GilDash: You forgot to capitalize the O making it a proper noun
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> im still dumb founded by VioletGreySha s drawing
*DitzyHooves magically swaps everypony in chat's genders
*GilDash kisses Om more for corrections.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> dafuq DitzyHooves
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol
<cachi01> what is this disscussion about? O_o
<pipsqueakthepirate> uh
<pipsqueakthepirate> apparently about genderswap!
<Ninjazz> Ditzy and sex
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> cachi01: stuff
<pipsqueakthepirate> :D
<Om> GilDash: You forgot to square the root sum of the O
<N4X> What the?!
<alexxm> thanks for the boobs DitzyHooves
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I'll have some of that last one, please. ;)
<Airpuff|Drawing> cachi01: wether or not dizty is derpy.. or something..
<N4X> How did we got there Ninjazz?
<pipsqueakthepirate> everyone who hasn't yet, read "two peas in a pod"
<CK|Ded> Anyways, need to take off. That discussion sorta threw me off-track and I wanted to get some stuff done today. >.<
<cachi01> Airpuff|Drawing: oooh ok lol
<Om> GilDash: He said and. Why chose?
<DitzyHooves> in one universe Ditzy is Jenny, the doctor's daughter
<GilDash> Om: I wonder what you'd taste like with marshmellows in your ears...
<Meanwhile> Seeya CK|Ded.
