<pony_1689> привет всем:D
<JohnnyNorthrain> I'm just curious about OC's. I haven't done one but I write my character Johnny Northrain in a fic. OC's are just kinda too much for me but seeing how people do them is interesting. What colors, names and marks they choose.

<Ponies47> Spell-of-Gaming: Indeed
<Mr_Anybody> i need some chocolate cake
<TheDamShadow01> this is my new clock XD
<Canadian_Brony|TF2> AJIsAwesome the server has a Hale mod on it, and because of this, I need to download extra files to play on it and it's taking FOREVER!!!
<Canadian_Brony|TF2> <this one

<Spell-of-Gaming> with a price
<Spell-of-Gaming> :I
<JohnnyNorthrain_> If you could travel to any country that you've not yet been to where would you go, what would you want to see and would you know the language?
<Invi> Spell-of-Gaming, but you already have it, so?
<muffinexplosion> Wait. If the rain is chocolate. Shouldn't the ocean be chocolate too?
<Dashie_Dashie> Spell-of-Gaming, I quit that game ever since the EOC update.
<Starfire86> Question: Favorite breakfast food?
<JohnnyNorthrain_> perhaps muffin perhaps
<JRP2234> Phase4 i made my wii get a stack overflow
<Spell-of-Gaming> Honestly, they might discontinue support for the prototype servers
<Dashie_Dashie> since I heard about it that is
<DBlue02_> I've never left the USA, but I've got three choices.
<Canadian_Brony|TF2> Mr_Anybody how? It's a link that links you the original source page by Googling it for you. I could see how the meta could melt your brain, but your computer should be fine.
<Canadian_Brony|TF2> Unless it has, like, 1 gig ram
<aniderp> bass cannon
<Mr_Anybody> my computer is a robot that behaves like a human
<Mr_Anybody> it's very possible
<Canadian_Brony|TF2> so, a robotic Lyra?
<Mr_Anybody> na
<Canadian_Brony|TF2> seems legit
<Mr_Anybody> just a robot end of discussion
<Spell-of-Gaming> Honestly I'm just playing Maplestory for now

<Native-Warrior> Pinkie hugging twilight was weird
<kimplix> indeed
<kimplix> especially that orange bird
<Native-Warrior> Pinkie seemed OOC for the first half of that episode
<JohnnyNorthrain_> I was pretty drunk and depressed and saw MLP on netflix. I needed something cute to watch and I went through the first two episodes not really caring about it. By the forth I was hooked but I went to Seattle.
<NocturnalBlade> well im off to bed :) good night yall
<something> hi eveypony
<alexxm> how've you been something
<JohnnyNorthrain_> While there I met a guy who owned a toy shop and kept going on about how horrible Bronies were.... not knowing I was on the teetering point of becoming one

<NocturnalBlade> hi and bye something
<JohnnyNorthrain_> Hey Jacob
<something> i got ban
<kimplix> and rarity's french accent, where was she from? france?

<something> i forgot to tell u that i was on a ship for 14 day
<Lightning_Mustang> What one of my friends does to clean their cards is soak out as much of the liquid from them they can, let them dry, then use just a small amount of Windex to wipe them off with (don't touch the borders) to keep them from staying sticky.
<pony_6353> i guess these chats aren't my thing just sit here and stare at it lol

<GamerLuna> Hi pot80 :)
<Temperton> Well sorry not Opinion i think its called otherwise but i dont know the word XD
<Venusy> choices
<SirVown> Temperton you should revise your question to be also transformed to a pony
<DJFluttershy> Im sorry I would too lol
<AlexSparkle> If you could go to Equestria once, you can ask Twilight to help you get back again
<DJFluttershy> 100 million is so much
*pot80 vigorously shakes GamerLuna's hand
<SirVown> always have to consider twilight or celestia being able to use a magic to keep you there
<Sumica> take money fund portal
<SirVown> i would take the one day
<AlexSparkle> Twilight always wants to help
<alexxm> it looks good pot80
<alexxm> how are things GamerLuna
<GamerLuna> shakes pot80 hand back, how are you pot80 ?
<pot80> thanks alexxm
<pony_918925> Besides. Fluttershy would like us. We look like apes-monkey-gorillas.
<AlexSparkle> Lyra would help!
<pot80> I'm average atm, you?
<pony_429860_> Question: Cookie or Portal gun?
<GamerLuna> Oh, things are good alexxm
<Temperton> THAT WOULD BE AWESOME
<AlexSparkle> First go to Lyra, she would help to talk with Twilight.
<Venusy> Portal gun is incredibly dangerous without long fall boots
<RAINBOWFAN> *le gasp* HI GamerLuna !
<Sumica> portal gun, no more walking to reach cookies
<AlexSparkle> Portal 1 at home, portal 2 in the cookie fabric
<Venusy> So you sell it to someone for 100 million Euros :V
<GamerLuna> Hi there RAINBOWFAN
<AlexSparkle> factory*
<pony_429860_> Question: Gotta care or Gotta Share?
<GenericPegasus> if you could have one super power, what would it be?
<Invi> oh hay GamerLuna :D
<AlexSparkle> "Why not take both?" YEAAAAAA
<GamerLuna> hi Invi
<Invi> GamerLuna, how's it going?
<FanCamp> Por favor, necesito comida y agua. Pan duro va a hacer!

<pony_918925> Sleeping is best time of the day. Oo
<Invi> me iz fine too
<calamity> "the superpower to have any superpower that i want".
<pony_429860_> Question: Nightmare Moon vs Freddy Kruger, who will win?
<AlexSparkle> Being allmighty contains everything you can imagine, and MORE
<GamerLuna> Good to hear Invi
<DJFluttershy> weeping angel
<Telofy> I would actually be quite scared of being offered the chance to gain a super power if there were a realistic chance of that happening.
<DJFluttershy> Weeping angels take you back in time while the SCP just kills you

<DJFluttershy> I wish I could stay away forever without needing to sleep at all
<RAINBOWFAN> Ya? really, GamerLuna?

<GenericPegasus> what is your favorite snack
<Temperton> What fun is there in making Sense ?
<Z> :OOATMEAL R U CRAZ?!?:O:O:D
<Perrydotto> ^^^^^^
<RandomNinja> as of Fall Weather Friends, Twilight's flank is the meaning of life
<patec> not only then
<patec> count the peaks of all the stars on her cutie mark.
<RandomNinja> true
<Sumica> so friendship is the answer to life the univers and everything
<AlexSparkle> Twilight IS the meaning of life, no exceptions
<alexxm> yes i am Z
<Sumica> Stiching spike
<Z> LOL:D
<FanCamp> ¿Qué pasa con esta persona? Tales actos haría Arturo rollo Lima en su tumba! http://fav.me/d5g2meu
<Yavos> Hello people.
<patec> Hi
<AlexSparkle> Question: What do you think about that MLP Gameloft game for Smartphones?
<AlexSparkle> hi yavos
<AlexSparkle> Would you like to add me? ;)
<GenericPegasus> if you could get anything you ever desired, but you had to give up art to obtain it, would you take it?
<Z> WUT
<AlexSparkle> I have over 350 Friends in the game xD
<Sumica> turn off internet
<Z> :'(
<Sumica> manualy set time
<FanCamp> Continuó su locura! ¿Qué clase de hombre enfermo crearía tales atrocidades en el entretenimiento de la familia? http://fav.me/d5g3g05
<Sumica> collect gems for playing 5days in a row
<RandomNinja> I don't have a smartphone :(
<Z> ..........................................
<Yavos> What Sumica said: if you deactivate your wifi/internet on the tablet/phone you can get many things for money instead the other stuff
<Z> WUT
<AlexSparkle> I only need Magnum, then I have everything you can buy with bits, lol
<Sumica> not just that Yavos, all the timers in game go by the phones set time and how long sence the game last looked at the time
<Z> :[PONIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ...GIMME ME PONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ...
<Temperton> Are the Villains of MLP realy evil or just Misunderstood ?
<Sumica> so if you set the time to the next day you collect the dalily bonus
<Tyro> Afternoon guys.
<AlexSparkle> Nightmare Moon is misunderstood
<Sumica> and the shops job time advances
<RandomNinja> Pretty sure Sumbra was evil
<AlexSparkle> Chrysalis is evil
<Tyro> And evil. Largely evil.
<RandomNinja> Sombra*
<muffinexplosion> Crysalis just wants loooooooove
<Yavos> @Sumica yeah, the time cheat is pretty nice... but some people encountered a problem after a certain date where they didn't get any bonus anymore
<FanCamp> Si continúa, sin duda le dará a todos los bronies un mal nombre! Arturo Lima no va a funcionar con Lauren Faust! http://fav.me/d5ga5vu
<Tyro> And Chrysalis takes it rather than trying to earn it. Evil.
<Sumica> hmm
<AlexSparkle> She wants power
<RandomNinja> I fail to understand how conquering Equestria would give you love
<AlexSparkle> Discord just wants to play
<Sumica> mind you you cant get bonuses for day you already got them
<RandomNinja> Discord isn't evil, he is an omnipotent troll
<Tyro> She has power over illusion and the mind, evidently. She can force love.
<Yavos> @RandomNinja in Equestria live a lot of ponies that do have that love. You just have to collect it then.
<Tyro> With a love net.
<RandomNinja> @Yavos it would be easier to blend in and get friends
<DJFluttershy> NMM did it for revenge, Discord did it for fun and revenge, crysalis did it for love and to survive. Sombra did it for... uuhhhh... yeah...
<Yavos> I guess Changelings don't know how to make friends.
<RandomNinja> CRYSTALS...
<patec> crystals
<AlexSparkle> Gilda is evil, because she only accepts "cool" ponies
<RandomNinja> Gilda is just a bitch
<AlexSparkle> pfft coolness
<FanCamp> Si solo traductor Google podría acercarnos podríamos terminar esta calumnia mal! http://fav.me/d5gjqx2
<pony_204229> Just wanna say to the artists good job keep it up!
<Tyro> Being unpleasent doesn't make you evil though.
<RandomNinja> @yavos possible
<valoreins|Borderland> what's with the foreign language guy?
<RandomNinja> they do seem rather stupid
<alexxm> no idea he's been here most of the day from what i can tell
<AlexSparkle> Question: Do you like mmmmmm... Bananas?
<Tyro> I wouldn't say that. They did successfully infultrate a kingdom undetected.
<FanCamp> Este espectáculo es el único espectáculo que me da algo de luz a enfrentar el día.
<patec> we already had that question earlier alex :P
<RandomNinja> still, Chrysalis seemingly only fed of Shining's love for Cadence (directed at her). You can't force love.
<AlexSparkle> damn, i wasn't here D:
<RandomNinja> TO THE MOON!
<GenericPegasus> if you could be someone else for 1 week, who would it be?
<RandomNinja> can I be God?
<Tyro> @RandomNinja No, but you can...harvest the love of someone else through illusion and whatever.
<aniderp> hm
<Temperton> If you would be Cats,how would you look like ?
<SafariMonkey> Hello everyone, how are you?
<AlexSparkle> A changeling who can transform into god, and use it's power then
<aniderp> hi
<Tyro> Create the ultimate muffin?
<AdamTheDuck> Well I'm off, I really need sleep before the exams
<Yavos> But they don't have new powers when they transform.
<AdamTheDuck> Bye~
<RandomNinja> @Alex no they can't
<AlexSparkle> D:
<Yavos> They always keep their old powers
<RandomNinja> Chrysalis had those spells
<AlexSparkle> A red Perry cat
<Tyro> Maybe is special changeling magic?
<RandomNinja> the Cheshire cat
<alexxm> bye AdamTheDuck good luck
<Yavos> Chrysalis had those spells because she had them before, too.
<Z> BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI!
<FanCamp> Estamos a la espera de una corriente ya que planeamos para someter a un periodista de investigación. Mira esta persona horrible. http://fav.me/d5kewnt
<AlexSparkle> Question: Tree or Rock?
<RandomNinja> I like how we're making scientific discussion on cute, technicolor ponies.
<Not_a_Canada_Brony> imma BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK
<Tomtortoise> The wisest man, is he who understands, that he understands nothing
<RandomNinja> But if you're a tree... *sunglasses* ... you've got wood!
<Not_a_Canada_Brony> :D
<AlexSparkle> or easier, team Bloomberg or team Tom xD
<Tyro> Tom, that's wise but also maddeningly confusing.
<Nobo> hi
<Tomtortoise> Heya Nobo
<GenericPegasus> Would you rather have power over fire, water, wind, earth (like rocks), or nature (like plants)
<Tyro> Greatings Nobo.
<AlexSparkle> Would you rather like to make a cloudball fight, or a snowball fight?
<FanCamp> Si j'ai enlevé ma chemise, peut-on jouer au basket?
<RandomNinja> cloudball, because clouds
<RandomNinja> you have to be a pegasus
<RandomNinja> stormballs > iceballs
<Not_a_Canada_Brony> Si j'ai enlevé ma chemise, peut-on jouer au basket? MY REPLY:WUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT?
<Tyro> Snowball! You can pretend your playing Pokemon!

<Rex_Mundi> It brings up an interesting question, are all animals intelligent sentiant creatures? The critters that Fluttershy knows are, but are the frogs? Maybe some creatures are intelligent, but others are just animals... maybe it has something to do with Equestria being magical and that the ponies have to manually change the weather.
<Valnar1001> oh
<Valnar1001> well, bummer xD

<Shizuka> 13that's... a problem .-.
<Tomtortoise> You have to own atleast 3 guns to live in Texas
<Temperton> If Jimmy cracks corn and no one cares, why is there a song about him?
<DoctoDoctorWho> FEAR NOT Kujo_Jojo, UNDER MY INFLUENCE, YOU SHALL LEARN THE WAY OF MANLINESS.
<Yavos> I once looked at the german MLP magazine, but I didn't like it that much.
<SuperPsyguy> at least
<Shizuka> 13asuka's registered but not linked to me so..
<Kujo_Jojo> DoctoDoctorWho THANK YOU MASTER
<Manearion> It'sso great!
<Manearion> You learn for example that you should never trust a zebra.
<Manearion> And that Scootaloo is actually Celestias daughter and is named Terry.
<Yavos> Really? xD
<SuperPsyguy> If you could be any kind of tree what kind of tree would you be?
<Shizuka> 13no idea if this will work but Venus i'm wondering if maybe irssi doesn't unban if you lose connection before the timer's up
*DoctoDoctorWho speakes an encoded message entirely through flexing of the muscles.

<Vordox> J_E_Smith71: Lawl, no?
<BlaxBlain> Alright i'm back and I finished the episode.
<Shizuka> 13sb, maybe you should use a stream service we can actually embed?
<Vordox> J_E_Smith71: I could pop out this chat and have a perma stream on someone else's behalf =P
<J_E_Smith71> SuperBrony64: Oh wait the stream is embedding on Bronystate aftera;;
<ghost> Request addendum: For the parasprite-tribble boxing if it hasn’t been done. The little ring in the foreground with Lyra as if she was walking by and noticed it. A little thought bubble coming from her showing arms crossed out with something like an X. Under the image a little segment showing magic effect holding up glue, two popsicle sticks snapped in the middle, and 4 little boxing gloves.
<Kujo_Jojo> AttackWithHugs he is my master in manliness training
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: Can't unless someone wants to restream me.
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: I just hit play and the stream is embedding here after all.
<Safari|colt> Vordox: It's only due to technical issues. It was embedded but that capped the number of users so he did it this way. It's still a stream.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Kujo_Jojo: Thank you, now let us hug AttackWithHugs, TOGETHER!

<Yavos> @Herp can't find spy Pinkie on the list, adding it now
<Canadian_Brony> BlaxBlain copy the url on the sream, open a new tab, and watch the stream there. I aslso suggest you pop it out and do some adjusting so everything fits.
<Herp> ok^^
<Latiken> You missed Spitfire, btw.
<Tomekke> just chatting a bit with her
<Canadian_Brony> Windows 7 works wonders for that :)

<BlaxBlain> He is playing black oops
<YokusaHHart> dat metal
<Venusy> there doesn't seem to be a permanent one from what I can see
<Kurra> Dark_Horst, you haven't actually been blocked, there's just something where you're conneting that doesn't like some part of Justin.tv. I had this happen to me
<Lil_B> I heard Big Giant Circles worked on the Black Ops II Soundtrack, love to see the old Remixers getting great Jobs like that
<thelonepony> so sprunkls, no revenge from yesterday?
<BlaxBlain> Superbrony mind if I try and join you?

<Dark_Horst> Kurra: ah
<DoctoDoctorWho> BlaxBlain: take a hug and a full on tackle and combine them into one, that is a glomp
*Bronysith glomps SuperBrony64
<Canadian_Brony> Dark_Horst this link will send you directly to a pop-out of the stream, so just put the new tab in a new window and re-arrange 'em
<Canadian_Brony> http://www.twitch.tv/superbrony64/popout
<Diagon197> and yet salahir is still not streaming
<twilight_sprinkle> i will at some point, tehlonpon, i wont forget
<Tomtortoise> HK is best German gun manufacturer
<Kurra> Like at uni, I coulsn't watch streams, and was blocked, but at home I was fine.
<DeerioJim> yaaay. thank you!
<thelonepony> :3
<alexxm> how come Kurra
<Dark_Horst> Canadian_Brony: dowsnt want to
<AlexSparkle> If sending love would count as money and sending hate would count as liability, MLP would be the richest fandom
<Dark_Horst> still block
<Canadian_Brony> I got nothin' :/
<Kurra> Because the servers at uni prolly didn't like me streaming or something, who knows
<patec> done request: http://sta.sh/029ltcxpns98
<DoctoDoctorWho> I liked newborn cuties
<MovieTrash> G36 is best
<Panda> hm...
<Yavos> @Diagon he doesn't even seem to be online :|
<Panda> So whats going on up in here?
<Kujo_Jojo> DoctoDoctorWho we all like newborn cuties
<thelonepony> ohai Panda
<DoctoDoctorWho> we should have streamed g3.6 instead of s3
<Bronysith> Panda: it wasnt the last boss of hte disc ;_;
<BlaxBlain> SuperBrony64: Can you post yourgamertag
<Wrek> 05what a dilemma...
<Panda> Bronysith: hehe ;)
*Kurra is reminded of the My Lai Massacre, from the foliage.

<DoctoDoctorWho> Wrek: be a baws and kick it down
<alexxm> this game needs more suplexes

<JohnnyNorthrain> Question for the Artists; Did Discord and Celestia have something in the past?

<Herp> Are you going to do this again soon?
<BlaxBlain> I will join after this match
<BlaxBlain> <3
<Canadian_Brony> especially those 12-yr-old with a mic. I'm fine if they play it, no one knows who you really are in these games, but don't give 'em a mic.
<BlaxBlain> Was anyone here in phase4 tf2 stream last night?
<Canadian_Brony> yesh
<Canadian_Brony> why?
<GenericPegasus> poor perry been up the whole time
<BlaxBlain> I was playin with him\
<Everlasting_Joy> BlaxBlain: I wish, what happened?
<Canadian_Brony> BlaxBlain me too :)
<BlaxBlain> Awesome!
<Canadian_Brony> Everlasting_Joy he was playing on a Vs. Ponyville server. It was . . . interesting.
<patec> http://salahir.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5li381
<BlaxBlain> Should I put my mic on or off when I join?
<Everlasting_Joy> Canadian_Brony: Those always are :).
<JohnnyNorthrain> Perry's young she can handle it
<Yavos> @Diagon your request is ready: http://fav.me/d5li381
<Everlasting_Joy> Kirby <3.
<Chrysalis> hmmm, do i actually patch my xbox to play this
<Wrek> 05xbox has fucked up the progress of modern graphical fidelity >:C
<Vordox> What is SB64 playin?
<DashWithRainbows> Vordox CoD BO1.
<Chrysalis> Wrek not really, PC's are still looking better and better
<BlaxBlain> Cod bo1
<Kurra> Do we have VOX on black ops?
<Vordox> DashWithRainbows: Is it able to play via PC to Xbox?
<Chrysalis> its just publishers and manufaactorers dont want to risk new hardware
<Dark_Horst> just found out why i got the ban screen. my stealthy was active. no dea when that happended. but yeah :P
<DashWithRainbows> He's streaming his console I believe.
<Chrysalis> manufacturer*
<DashWithRainbows> Which I want to know how he does that.
<Vordox> DashWithRainbows: What's why I asked
<Wrek> 05Chrysalis: coutner proof: Crysis 1 looks more or less better and/or the same as the latest one. the latest one is built in newest tech, the first crysis on 07 tehcnology
<Vordox> that's
<oni_link> DashWithRainbows: I believe he has a capture card
<Nittany_Discord> Wrek: Why is your dad in the hospital?
<Chrysalis> oh yeah, however the new one ran nearly 3 times as fast
<JohnnyNorthrain> So if Discord had a Coconut, what would he turn it into being the embodiment of chaos.
<BlaxBlain> Guys, want my mic on or off?
<JohnnyNorthrain> ?
<DashWithRainbows> oni_link I'll have to ask him when he isn't streaming at some point.
<Chrysalis> and the original wasnt based in 07 tech
<BlaxBlain> When I join
<pony_489367> still stream being streames? cool
<Chrysalis> it was made to push future computers
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: is it able for me to play via PC on your Xbox match?
<Cheeseball> 40K?
<thelonepony> On if you like BlaxBlain
<Chrysalis> whereas the newer one was made to push current computers
<Wrek> 05he had side pains, enoug hto warrant a trip to the ER. nor the "i has gas" kind of pain
<oni_link> DashWithRainbows: let me know what he tells you, I want to know as well.
<PaletteSwap> the pinkie lisa looks so cute
<Canadian_Brony> DashWithRainbows eeyup, 360. He uses a graphics card and video input splitter. The graphics card sends input to his computer and the video input splitter allows him to play on his TV and have the same video sent to his computer.
<DashWithRainbows> Vordox No, you'd have to play on Xbox to play in his game.
<Cheeseball> or Monty Python Spanish Inquisition?
<BlaxBlain> I'll try not to talk as much as I did in the TF2 stream
<ghost> Ponies grimdark: Sugar shortage
<JohnnyNorthrain> Warhammer 40k
<Vordox> DashWithRainbows: Aaand I lost interest in Xbox...forever+1
<Kujo_Jojo> On BlaxBlain
<Wrek> 05not*
<Tomtortoise> What else floats? Small rocks!
<DashWithRainbows> 'kay-'kay.
<BlaxBlain> Alrighty
<DoctoDoctorWho> hehe, one of Saturns moons is bigger than mercury.
<AlexSparkle> i've just realised that this giant map of the part of the world where the ponies live, is atleast 10x bigger than our earth
<pony_489367> is that a mona lisa pinkie pie?
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: Is it smaller then PLuto?
<BlaxBlain> Games almoast over should be joining soon.
<Venusy> @Perry Have you seen that Star Trek FMV game with Q and the Borg?
<oni_link> Vordox: thats how its always been, only game iirc that had cross platform play was shadowrun
<DashWithRainbows> Canadian_Brony I'll ask him which types he uses and how he does it completely.
<Kujo_Jojo> Dat Moon
<pony_489367> hahahahaha
<Vordox> oni_link: Portal 2
<oni_link> Vordox: or Portal 2. I forgot about that as well
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: eenope
<Canadian_Brony> DoctoDoctorWho . . . knowing our local sexual philanthropist has a rather similar nick, I took that in a disturbingly wrong way..
<JohnnyNorthrain> Does Q even have nuts?
<oni_link> Well now Im confused.
<BlaxBlain> Phase4 landed on the moon last night on kerbel space program.
<Venusy> I like that game over where they all just walk off
<Chrysalis> Anyone else spend far more time in zombies than MP on these games?
<Kurra> Canadian_Brony: that was best non-naming reference to anyone else XD
<oni_link> damnit I missed it.
<Everlasting_Joy> Chrysalis: Me.
<Cheeseball> @alex how come?
<DashWithRainbows> I just realized SB is using the FAMAS...
<Chrysalis> Zombies is easily the best part of these games
<DoctoDoctorWho> Canadian_Brony: I wonder if he's still here?
<Jewelscore> One doth protest too much
<jelonheoh> everyone on my friends list is either playing black ops 2 or halo 4 dammit
<Tomtortoise> ProTip: Q is a Squirrel
<oni_link> Chrysalis: thats what everyone I know that owns these games tells me. They bought the second one for that reason as well.
<oni_link> ^
<BlaxBlain> I would complain about the famas but SuperBrony64 is just too cool!
<Canadian_Brony> Chrysalis hells. Fucking. Yes. Non-stop Ascension is what I do. I only do MP on MWII and CoDIII
<Chrysalis> oni_link i will be buying it when its cheaper
<Derpy_Hooves> gg
<SuperBrony64> 11,02gg :)
<patec> nuclear luna: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ct0yrwixgl74hwt/nuclearluna.png
<DeerioJim> hell yes dinner and stream
<DashWithRainbows> FAL dual mag > Famas.
<JohnnyNorthrain> Question; Given the vastness of the universe and that we are just small points on a grand cosmic scale would you say it's easily justifiable to eat an entire cake in one sitting like Pinkpie Pie?
<Chrysalis> just waiting for when they release it as its own game
<Chrysalis> will be the best thing
<SuperBrony64> 11,0260-65% complete
<BlaxBlain> Another win!
<DerpyMuffins> Is that BS Bronystate SuperBrony64?
<Chrysalis> dont care about the SP or the MP
<Chrysalis> zombiez ftw
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yesh DerpyMuffins :3
<Tomtortoise> Necular Luna is awesome
<AlexSparkle> @Cheeseball So if Equestria is as big as the USA
<BlaxBlain> Joining
<Chrysalis> hmmm, wonder if my xbox and BO can patch faster than your wiiu
<jelonheoh> i tried to join dammit
<MLP_Brovakiin> SuperBrony64: Did you get my message? o3o
<DashWithRainbows> Yes, it would.
<oni_link> Chrysalis: me too but think about it. by the time it becomes cheaper, the next one will be on its way.
*DoctoDoctorWho wants some feels
<Herp> Have you guys played tf2?
<BlaxBlain> <3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moooo :3
<Caumen> If you do it while shouting and flailing with your arms JohnnyNorthrain, you should be OK.
*Kujo_Jojo gives DoctoDoctorWho feels
<jelonheoh> he should start a private match for people on bronystate
<MLP_Brovakiin> :D
*SuperBrony64 huggles DoctoDoctorWho :D

<SpeedyBolt> Hey guys
<MLP_Brovakiin> that was me, my bad :D
<Perrydotto> http://asknuclearluna.tumblr.com/post/35993585835/
<Chrysalis> true, but im not paying full price for 3 seperate entities when i only care about one
<BlaxBlain> Game is starting up!
<muffinexplosion> yay. happy derpy is finished
<Nirual> I'd say both pronounciations are valid
<oni_link> so are they in a public match or private?
<MLP_Brovakiin> sorry SuperBrony64, I had to do that :P
*Kujo_Jojo Glomps DoctoDoctorWho
*DoctoDoctorWho huggles SuperBrony64 back
<RandomNinja> What class?
<MadSurge> SuperBrony64: MOOOO <3
<Everlasting_Joy> Neigh.
<Canadian_Brony> DashWithRainbows just about any gun is better than the Famas. They ruined the guns in Black Ops. Famas is automatic and underpowered, secondaries are just f*cking useless, and you can put a lot less crap on your shotguns. You know it's a sad day when you see a Silenced SPAS
<zaney> nah
<DoctoDoctorWho> Kujo_Jojo: :)
<Tomtortoise> I have about 10
<Nirual> I got close to 1600 hours in tf2... gah
<RAWRity> bonjour
<MLP_Brovakiin> Gee, I wish I still had this game, I wanna play with SB now :3
<Canadian_Brony> hi RAWRity
<zaney> ak 47 is best assaulkt rifle
<Kujo_Jojo> DoctoDoctorWho:)
<DerpyMuffins> You reload at the worst of times SuperBrony64
<Jewelscore> Medic is credit to team!
<oni_link> Canadian_Brony: Yeah I used to use that XD
<DashWithRainbows> Um, Canadian_Brony... The Famas is well known for being OP.
<dashie> hello
<JohnnyNorthrain> I just never could get into TF2, It's not my bag baby
<aji> Eli | AJIsAwesome: you're also hard to tab... with aji online
<aji> that happens to be my super power
<Nirual> I like engineer for the same reason
<LotrPony> The Guild!
<Kurra> DerpyMuffins: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times....
<MadSurge> Screw wimpy guns, I want a rocket launcher or a manual anti-tank rifle :D
<RandomNinja> Yep, it's been scientifically proven one medic is the most importart difference to a team
<Yavos> @pony_489367 yes, it is a mona lisa pinkie!
<DoctoDoctorWho> *cough*M16*cough*
<YokusaHHart> I want a BFG
<MadSurge> ^^^^
<DashWithRainbows> Besides, Pistols in the game are still good! Freaking CZ76 with extended clip = my waifu
<zaney> m16
<zaney> ?
<DashWithRainbows> And the FAL
<DashWithRainbows> Oh god, I love my semi-automatics.
*zaney ffall sover dying of laughter
<Kujo_Jojo> brb
<oni_link> Im more inclined to used semi-auto rifles, theyre more fun imo
<zaney> m16 syc==ucks
<Kurra> MadSurge PANZERFAUST *shooom*
<Wrek> 05the m16 is a silyl weapon
<DeerioJim> tweet and ask if any of the other VAs would like to join
<zaney> since when doies burst of three beat semi auto of full auto?
<Chrysalis> Also, hardcore made this game so much more fun
<Wrek> 05prefer higher caliber
<Nirual> oh lawd, foal papers on twitter got a G3 face now too
<Nirual> its everywhere
<jelonheoh> if you have the m16 with acog on hardcore you kick ass
<DashWithRainbows> M16 on hardcore is beast.
<MadSurge> Kurra: I prefer Doom or arcade laser gun games :3
<DashWithRainbows> I loved it on HCHQ
<Chrysalis> pisols are generally better i found on hardcore
*DoctoDoctorWho prefers a mossberg 500 shotgun as weapon of choice
<Kurra> also thing of how many grains of powder are behind each bullet, that matters possibly more
<zaney> fnfal is best if u know how to use it
<oni_link> aaaaannnd I killed chat .-.
<Bronysith> is there a stream going on right now?
<jelonheoh> the only reason i still use m16 is becasue of hardcore gamemodes
<Canadian_Brony> DashWithRainbows I still prefer MWII. Three-burst Famas with a SPAS. You could go for the nuke on that loadout.
<Tomekke> A little request: Humanised Celestia as lady justice (not blindfolded), and of course a bit godlike? Maybe it sucks, dunno ^^"
<MovieTrash> question: how important is mlp for you? how much time do you spend on mlp stuff?
<DashWithRainbows> Yeah, that's OP, Canadian_Brony.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Random Merch: Earbuds, Belt Buckle, Wrapping Paper, and More!
<DashWithRainbows> Famas and Spas in that game were really OP.
<vinyl> hello everypony
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy vinyl!
*YokusaHHart doesn't understand all this gun talk so just smiles and nods
<MLP_Brovakiin> SuperBrony64: I remeber when you joined ma minecraft game on xbox, the one with all the ponies, and you where just frollicking around :3
<Canadian_Brony> DashWithRainbows could something be OP if everything else is too?
<Vordox> YokusaHHart: Let me translate. "bla bla bla bla bla GUNS bla bla KILLING AND MURDERING bla bla bla Hero bla bla."
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows Gotta say single shot weapons in BLOPS 2 are powerful i use the FAL and it's god damn easy to kill with though it's not fire as fast as you can pull the trigger. It's limited to how fast you can press so shucks it's usually best for medium long range fights
<DoctoDoctorWho> Is it okay if I say the Mossberg 500 is a really badass gun?
<Dark_Horst_> which stream is hers?
<LotrPony> Perrydotto
<Caramel_Colours> Hi everypony!
<YokusaHHart> ah, thsnks Vordox! I'm more of a blade person :3
<Yavos> @Tomekke added
<DashWithRainbows> killerpony7733 Blame people complaining about quick-fire modded controllers.
<Venusy> Camera not currently focusing on it at the momemnt
<DashWithRainbows> I used to have one, got rid of it.

<Lil_B> I still think the Aspergers 400 is the best Weapon
<oni_link> I kinda don't like how they toned down the gore and dismemberment of the bodies when they get blown up or shot at point blank range with shotguns like in World at War.
<DashWithRainbows> All in the trigger finger, baby!
<Vordox> YokusaHHart: Same, i prefer where you actually use weapons, and not just aim them
<zaney> katana ftw
<Tomekke> thanks yavos
<vinylscratch> hello everypony
<Canadian_Brony> hi vinylscratch
<YokusaHHart> ninjato ftw!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai vinylscratch
<DoctoDoctorWho> YokusaHHart: Glory to the scottish claymore
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows Yeah i remember MW1 with it's weapons being fire as fast as you as you can press the mouse button. Made the battle rifle they had awesome. But yeah >.>
<jelonheoh> backstab
<Carrot_Top> That Awkward Moment when you become emotionaly imversed and cheer for a guy running his heart out to catch a bus, only to realize he was just excersizing...

<YokusaHHart> DoctoDoctorWho: that's my second favorite sword
<DoctoDoctorWho> YokusaHHart: 1st?
<Lil_B> Kurra no xD
<JohnnyNorthrain> Yeah Perry's stream is not on screen
<jelonheoh> just clear system cache and glicthes work again
<YokusaHHart> DoctoDoctorWho: I just said, Ninjato :)

<Yavos> You can also request things. We will write down your request in a list and if someone feels like doing it, it will be done
<Tomekke> Do the artists make some special preparation for this stream? Like putting a special cussion or so :3
*Kujo_Jojo kills jelonheoh

<thelonepony> so we're having a fight then?!! http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdk0j7Ug9U1rvfvyv.gif
<Kurra> |D
<Lunar_Eclipsed> Who are your favorite actor?

<Yavos> @Herp some of these ideas might be used, but there's no guarantee
*Kurra raises the flag of overcast skies, nullifies the NLR and whatever the sun ponies are on about....
<Kurra> Behold the Union Jack! |D
<Yavos> @Carrot_Top you already have Carrot Top eating a carrot listed. I'm not gonna add this one :P
<JohnnyNorthrain> It helps if they can talk back to you in Spanish. Otherwise you are just being strange
<Caramel_Colours> I sent a request a bit ago if you would like, Perry.

<BlaxBlain> BRB gotta go take out some trash!
<Caramel_Colours> Question for DeathPwny: What Program are you using?
<muffinexplosion> suikuzu is so gonne be watched on dA by me from now on...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It finished downloading all the stuff, now it's updating, which is going by much faster
<Tomekke> I hope so muffinexplosion, she's a really good artist :3
<CrystalPhoenix> SuperBrony64, so basically you have slow internet?
<Shizuka> 13THRILL at the state of modern console gaming
<DoctoDoctorWho> Kujo_Jojo: If you dont mind, I have 1 request
<Shizuka> 13presented to you LIVE in GLORIOUS 640x480 resolution
<Caramel_Colours> Gimp won't work on my computer for some reason. ;/
<SuperBrony64> 11,02CrystalPhoenix: No, but I'm sure Nintendo's servers are being slamed right now :/
<Caramel_Colours> *:/
<patec> oh, hi tom
<Bronysith> oh great, more PC vs console stuff
<CrystalPhoenix> SuperBrony64, good point
<Tomekke> hi patec
<Kujo_Jojo> DoctoDoctorWho what is it my Master
<Tomtortoise> keep making donations guys!
<DoctoDoctorWho> Kujo_Jojo: Dont call me master, call me teacher.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You hear audio right?
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, you're right there shouldn't be a debate
<Kujo_Jojo> yes teacher
<J_E_Smith71> Yes
<killerpony7733> SuperBrony64 Yap
<DoctoDoctorWho> That is all I am
<CrystalPhoenix> Everyone knows the PC is better
<Kurra> Hey, 640x480 is GREAT resolution. Yo uguys have no idea how fun 640x480x256 colors can be!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02256 colors? Spoiled...
*Kurra finishes saying that with a Sweetie Belle voicecrack!
<DoctoDoctorWho> hehehe
<Nirual> do it for the chickens! I mean, kids
<stallion1> art=awesome
<Yavos> @Lunar_Eclipsed added
<Anuk> Question for DeathPwny: What dimensions does your current drawing have?
<Kurra> Early 90s Mac gaming was awesome.
<Carrot_Top> i had Gimp before...It gave me plug-in errors :P
<Kurra> honest.
<Ponies47> PC's are awesome O3O
<Kujo_Jojo> DoctoDoctorWho what is it maste... i mean teacher
<alexxm> what game did they have Kurra
<Everlasting_Joy> SuperBrony64: Yeah, audio is fine.
<Shizuka> 13pff 320x240 16 color was where it was at
<Caramel_Colours> That's what it's giving me Carrot!
<Shizuka> 13speaking of i was going to try to get carmen sandiego DOS working but VM doesn't want to do sound with it
<Carrot_Top> Well :P
<Kurra> Escape Velocity, um... well I forget the names of the rest but I have them stored away. Barrack...
<Kurra> well...
<Anuk> ty ;)
<killerpony7733> Hey shizu have you finished quake 4 yet?
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Shizuka> 13tron too
<killerpony7733> Awww
<Kurra> here everypony, Mac games from like 1993 - 2010: http://www.ambrosiasw.com/
<TyroTheFox> Hmmm?
<Rex_Mundi> Whats going on?
<Handsome_Jack> you were using god mod on tron shizu. but it was still awesome
<Kurra> There was a Joust clone, there was even a 68040 processor 3D driving game!
<Handsome_Jack> mode*
<Yavos> We need more questions!
<Lingonrise_> How long does the stream have left now?
<Yavos> and donations
<Shizuka> 13yes but ponies should know by now that i consider restarts to be horribly boring stream material
<J_E_Smith71> Rex_Mundi: We're about to witness some WiiU goodness
<CrystalPhoenix> Kurra, this is what I thought while reading that url http://layton.wikia.com/wiki/The_City_of_Ambrosia
<Kurra> And there were lots of little cool time waster games, and um....
<DoctoDoctorWho> I cant think of computer gibberish without this coming to mind anymore. http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdlu8q5p0r1rxmai6o1_1280.jpg
<Yavos> 2 hours, 45 minutes are left
<Tomekke> What did the artists do this weekend then :3
<BlaxBlain> I'm back and ready to watch some wiiU
<Tomekke> And did they eat cereals as breakfast
<CrystalPhoenix> DoctoDoctorWho, of Jay Naylor?
<Lingonrise_> Do you like the day or the night the most?
<Kurra> MechWarrior 2 was out by 1995, and that was HOURS and hours of fun and action, even though today it looks like wireframe pre-render.
<CrystalPhoenix> oooooh I see
<BlaxBlain> Had to refresh the stream
<DoctoDoctorWho> hehehe
<Kurra> Good gaming way back then. Even the Mac's System 7.5.3 had a hidden credits game embedded.
<Rex_Mundi> Am i the only one who thinks that the premise of the latest episode was kinda disturbing? What exactly happens to you if you get sent "back to the pond"? O.o
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Console is restarting :)
<Lingonrise_> Which one of the for elements do you like the most / describe you best?
<Kurra> Avara was BAWSS fun.
<Lingonrise_> four*
<J_E_Smith71> Rex_Mundi: Death
<BlaxBlain> :D What are we going to watch him play?
<Bronysith> Which is better, persona 3 or 4?
<Kurra> But Escape Velocity was likely king of the 90 Mac gaming era, and lives on in EV:Override and EV:Nova.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rex_Mundi: the others were artificial, they had no true sentience
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, it depends alot
<YokusaHHart> Bronysith: Persona 4 IMO
<CrystalPhoenix> Persona 3 has a lot of grind
<Yavos> Tomekke, your questions are ignored as it seems. xD
<Rex_Mundi> DoctoDoctorWho: Do we know that?
<CrystalPhoenix> and Persona 4 is quite more popular
<Yavos> maybe you should've added question marks
<patec> well.. they don't have questionmarks
<Tomekke> it seems yes
<Shizuka> 13the mirror pond was likely cloning
<Kurra> Ooh SuperBrony64 make a Jacko Mii XD
<Tomekke> ok!
<CrystalPhoenix> but I love the end moral in Persona 3
<Venusy> @Lingonrise Did you mean Earth, Air, Fire, Water rather than the Elements of Harmony?
<Kurra> Or nono, make a Lauren F. mii!
<Tomekke> I will add questionmarks :3
<Lingonrise_> Both
<Shizuka> 13the alternate theory that it's an alternate universe doesn't hold up once 2+ pinkies started summoning copies
<Diagon197> is salahir doing my request?
<J_E_Smith71> Can't bring your old Miis over?
<Bronysith> but i thought there is like an eternal rivalry between P3 and P4 fans?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02J_E_Smith71: You can :)
<patec> Luna on moon? that's already done
<Yavos> @Diagon it is already finished
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Doing it now
<CrystalPhoenix> THIS SONG
<Diagon197> is it on deviantart?
<CrystalPhoenix> WHY NINTENDO
<alexxm> Shizuka perhaps infinte universes is at work
<Yavos> @Diagon http://fav.me/d5li381
<Rex_Mundi> Or worse than death, non-existance...
<YokusaHHart> SOunds like Fairy's Fountain....
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rex_Mundi: they were all preprogrammed with pinkies intelligence, if they were "created", and had seperate souls, they would start knowing nothing and have to live their own lives.
<CrystalPhoenix> YokusaHHart, exactly
<CrystalPhoenix> well not now
<Yavos> We didn't notice he was missing at the stream until it was too late, sorry about that :/
<killerpony7733> alexxm Or perhaps it's simply good ol' magic that makes copies or duplicates if you will?
<AlexSparkle> wb JJ
<Yavos> Welcome back JJ! :D
<CrystalPhoenix> Also Bronysith I do believe there is but quite a few do love both
<Lingonrise_> Suiku is doing my request! Yay!
<Everlasting_Joy> Are we talking about the ending to the new episode? If we are, I'll be over here, not caring.
<CrystalPhoenix> and there are even some that love the classics like Persona 2 better
<Bronysith> CrystalPhoenix: but there is that eternal rivalry, like FFVII vs FFVI
<Shizuka> 13alexxm: yeah but in order for that to be consistent, the mirror pool would always lead to a new universe and never back
<Bak> eyebrows the internet
<Tomekke> Ok, so what did the artist do during the weekend? And did they eat cereals this morning? :3
<Shizuka> 13one pinkie goes through, arrives in a universe containing a pinkie, they go through and find another pinkie
<Shizuka> 13it would go up by 1 each time, not 2, 4, 6
<Kurra> Shizuka, reminds me of the Lost Room, where there's an infinity of rooms that can be reset.
<alexxm> killerpony7733 yeah that works i was just pointing out that infinite universes could be used to help that
<Rex_Mundi> Maybe getting sent back, merges you into the sub-consiousness of the remaining pinkies?
<Carrot_Top> Earth
<alexxm> ok good point Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13the alternate alternative would be it sends you to a mirror of the current universe, so two pinkies step through into a universe already containing two pinkies
<BlaxBlain> "We're about to run the biggest con game in the history of the multi-verse"~Cave Johnson.
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, to be honest I can't tell you how big the rivalry is but both games are arguably better than the other that's for sure
<patec> see? questionmarks!
<AlexSparkle> Did you guys have your daily ... Applejacks? ;)
<DoctoDoctorWho> If they sent the original pinkie back, I imagine she would be trapped, Behind the mirror if you will.
<Yavos> question marks. And your questions will be answered. xD
<CrystalPhoenix> since they are both kinda different to each other
<Rex_Mundi> Maybe a pocke demension, filled with the ponies that were sent back?
<Tomekke> man, those question marks are good
<Kujo_Jojo> I agree with the mirror theory
<CrystalPhoenix> I don't know what's better
<aniderp> that face near the end..
<CrystalPhoenix> the discussion of what is on the other side of the pond or is Twilight Sparkle a murderer
<JohnnyNorthrain> Solar flares
<DeerioJim> huh there really is static on
<J_E_Smith71> Nintendo finally moves up to a password system like XBLA and PSN
<Starfire86> Question: What is your favorite part of drawing ponies? Least favorite?
<killerpony7733> I like how people need complex explanations for a universe that holds ponies that can use magic for example. So why can't it just be good ol' magic which can make a exact mirror copy of a pony?
<DoctoDoctorWho> CrystalPhoenix: they were artificial constructs programmed to act like the host
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: cause people like to overanaylyze
<CrystalPhoenix> DoctoDoctorWho, we are not going into that
<alexxm> killerpony7733 thats what i thought what bugs me is who found out how it worked
<Kurra> Can we vote for TV movies for BMN? Because actually, I'd want us to see The Lost Room. That was a fascinating little show.
<Caumen> Skype
<Caumen> Wat r u doin
<Caumen> Skype
<Caumen> RESTART
<Yavos> it's doing strange things
<J_E_Smith71> Kurra: Yeah we had a TV movie here, they are Bs automatically
<killerpony7733> Bronysith True dat. But hey it's atleast a tad amusing to see and hear. Though the explanation can be so simple and needs no further explanation
<killerpony7733> :P
<Lingonrise_> What happend?
<Kurra> cool.
<Yavos> strange noises
<alexxm> Kurra we watched one of the discworld movies made by sky so yeah
<Everlasting_Joy> killerpony7733: Agreed, on your "complex analysis" statement.
<Tomtortoise> XD, rooter
<Kandarihu> What if the minds of the clones still exist somewhere within the Mirror Pool's dimension?
<Destiny> yo
<Destiny> i made it as planned
<Kurra> oh nevermind, it's a mniniseries, too long for BMN
<AlexSparkle> hey jose
<Starfire86> Stupid Skype
<J_E_Smith71> And finally, the WiiU ladies and gentlemen
<CrystalPhoenix> WAKAWAKA
<Lil_B> the WiiU Prepasring screen : O
<DoctoDoctorWho> If you turned off a robot that was programed to mimic human emotions, are you a murderer?
<AlexSparkle> hey hurr ^^
<Rex_Mundi> Maybe a Portal to the G3 universe?
<killerpony7733> Everlasting_Joy Sometimes the most simplest answer is the right one :)
<alexxm> ok i assume it's all just magic but who found out how it worked and how did they do it
<J_E_Smith71> Kurra: We had a long TV movie/miniseries before, that was over 3 hours
<Kurra> O RLY?
<Destiny> hey alex
<Kandarihu> DoctoDoctorWho, not if the robot can turn on again
<Everlasting_Joy> killerpony7733: If anything, people are analyzing something that doesn't need it.
<AlexSparkle> and hello cs
<CrystalPhoenix> Join the Nintendo fun Club today!
<Kurra> the lost room is SO MIND BENDINGLY fascinating ammagosh soooo werth seeing ffffs
<Venusy> Oh Flash.
<AlexSparkle> lol
<Latiken> DISCOOOOOOORD
<Everlasting_Joy> killerpony7733: Question, do you honestly think anyone on the show is a promoter of genocide?
<Kandarihu> So all of those Miis represent other users, right?
<patec> technical difficulties! please stand by!
<AlexSparkle> Reload
<Rex_Mundi> Everlasting_Joy: I like my fictional universes to work as settings, thus discussions like this are nessisary.
<Ruby_Sunrise> nmnbmn
<ghost> lol
<J_E_Smith71> That large Mii gathering room
<Yavos> oh, flash crashed again...
<AlexSparkle> and the advertisement will flush D:
<Destiny> flash plugin crashed
<Destiny> it happens a lot when i use firefox and it's ridiculous
<killerpony7733> Everlasting_Joy I can't really tell if i think so. Maybe maybe not :D
<hurrdurr10> lolol ads
<Lil_B> I can almost feel the native 1080p 60fps
<patec> um..
<DoctoDoctorWho1> Im not getting into this
<Yavos> great, I absolutely hate commercials that can't be skipped or at least muted
<DoctoDoctorWho1> http://i.qkme.me/3554v3.jpg
<BlaxBlain> I really can't take this discussion seriously.
<alexxm> Rex_Mundi ok we know magic exsits so blame it on that but who found out about the pound and how it worked
<Venusy> System mute option/volume mixer still works!
<J_E_Smith71> BlaxBlain: Well soon once the game starts we
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i wanna see what's on the eshop :3
<J_E_Smith71> have that to talk about
<Yavos> Yeah, but that usually mutes everything
<Rex_Mundi> alexxm: Discord maybe?
<AlexSparkle> hurr, did you get that skype right now?
<Tomtortoise> That Pinkie is better then the origonal
<ghost> Request: Either human or pony Luna and Celestia together looking up at a light blue sky where the moon is just visible. Something along the line of “The Sun & Moon aren’t always kept separate” as a line of text below the image. Better words can probably be thought of if it’s actually done.
<Tomtortoise> *Original
<Carrot_Top> Epic flash crash
<hurrdurr10> ......whut
<Carrot_Top> And once again..need adblock
<Perrydotto> Awww, what a cutr reqest
<Venusy> @Yavos No, on Windows 7/8 (possibly Vista), you can selectively mute windows (although you do have to mute all Flash players)
<BlaxBlain> Alright but it's a show about ponies and magic and junk I laugh at the fact that genacide is being discussed.
<Perrydotto> I wanna draw some human pony
<Perrydotto> So I will do that
<DoctoDoctorWho1> I kinda wanna change my nick, but if I do, people might not know who I am...
<Kandarihu> Man, when I gave my answer to DoctoDoctorWho's question, I didn't realize we were talking about yesterday's episode
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Better turn off stream to input this data >>
<AlexSparkle> does your skype work, hurr
<Ruby_Sunrise> Man, if I would have known how, I would have volunteered for this too.
<Rex_Mundi> BlaxBlain: The season premire had slavery
<BlaxBlain> I knoooooow
<Kurra> SuperBrony64: just dosconnect a cable no?
<killerpony7733> DoctoDoctorWho1 In basic. It's a kids show it holds good enough writing to appeal beyond that but reasons and explanations are usually something you'd best not put over say a fantasy world which would never go beyond that. It's mean't to be understandable for children and probably always will be thus we won't see those complex explanations of things and what not. That's just how i see it
<J_E_Smith71> BlaxBlain: I think I only used genocide as a joke when Twilight started shooting up the Pinkies
<Kurra> instead of stopping and starting?
<Lil_B> DoctoDoctorWho1 yeah, I wanna change my nick too, but peoplöe may not remember me than :(
<Kurra> ...or not :s
<Everlasting_Joy> Lil_B: You could always tell us you are Lil_B after the fact.
<Kurra> XD
<Shizuka> 13naw sb broadcast your credit card number to the world
<Yavos> @Venusy Still the problem if you have something running in FF with sound you want and then want to mute flash player, it mutes the complete FF
<Shizuka> 13nothing bad will happen
<King> I'd muck rather be this!
<Venusy> True
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: Do I input here for free internet stuff?
<BlaxBlain> I think someone should stream L4D2
<Cypresswolf> We're all trustworthy here >_>
<Skystorm> I can't believe that Perry is now streaming for almost 22hours /) for that, you're awesome can't say that often enough!
<Lil_B> Everlasting_Joy yeah, I know, but still... I tend to think to much about Stuff like that...
<Shizuka> 13yes start with your SSN
<ghost> Does sound seem gone for anyone else?
<Yavos> huh? did the sound mute just for me or for you too?
<Venusy> Uh, did it mute for everyone else, or did my headphones just break
<YokusaHHart> Assassin's Creed III!

<JohnnyNorthrain> Did perry's audio die?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02784-78-1234
<King_Kai> I mean, I'd much rather be this!
<Rex_Mundi> killerpony7733: We dont need complex explanations for why things work in this universe. But what happens when you get sent back to the pond, is kinda an interesting thing to talk about. ie, its not the magic thats under discussion, its the effects it has on the setting.
<Shizuka> 13all i see is ***-**-****
<Shizuka> 13you're fine
<AlexSparkle> perry is back
<Yavos> the whole stream audio died
<AlexSparkle> works again
<Cypresswolf> ^
<SuperBrony64> 11,02sweet
<Destiny> this is going to be a problem.
<Skystorm> audio's on again
<Yavos> it's back
<J_E_Smith71> SuperBrony64: That a fake number or you're friend code?
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: Moo :3
<Nirual> technical derpiculties
<Lil_B> 646.64.6464 I saw it all
<ghost> At least its close to the end
<killerpony7733> Rex_Mundi Sure sure. It's fun and really mind puzzling to actually try and make a answer for it. But in the reality the show won't go beyond just saying it's magic it's a legendary place that's it
<Yavos> derpiculties - I like that word. :3
<Shizuka> 13see like i used to use hunter2 for my password
<hurrdurr10> oh! y6eah alex
<Lil_B> Soo getting Oroshi Warriors 3, even though Samurai Warriors 3 on the Wii sucked :(
<hurrdurr10> yeah*
<Canebridge> 101.50.1337 - Nice number you got there
<Tomtortoise> Whats JJ Drawing?
<Kandarihu> I take it that that number that ends in 1234 can only be fake, right?
<Bakpony> urgh
<killerpony7733> Rex_Mundi Generally headcanon is complex and really hard to understand. But canon is simple and to the ground with what it is
<Kurra> Lets hope
<Bakpony> a horse i think
<Shizuka> 13but now my password is ***********************************
<Lil_B> SuperBrony64 there is an enterely new YouTube Setup, even foir the Wii
<Rex_Mundi> killerpony7733: Yeah, I know the show wont answer. But this episode raises the question of "wait, are those characters dead?"
<King_Kai> All these numbers, are OVER 9000!
<AlexSparkle> JJ, draw Baj
<AlexSparkle> :D
<DeerioJim> I think its a pony
<Bakpony> Alex, no.
<AlexSparkle> xD
<Bakpony> keep that out of here.
<DeerioJim> no OCs rule anyway
<ghost> Snowponies on a snow background on a bright day
<Yavos> So since all these awesome artists draw requests for you, why not consider donating? Or how about bidding on that awesome Autographed Taralicious Emblem by ShikariSpeeder http://derpy.me/QwztP ;D
<Handsome_Jack> im sooooo curious. what is zombiu?
<JohnnyNorthrain> Anyone have a fan going?
<hurrdurr10> JJ,can you draw queen chrysalis?
<Canebridge> So, what's with this this non-allowed Justin Frame
<Cypresswolf> RainbowDashisBestPony - Got it Shizu
<Tomtortoise> 2 of the DJs at Everypony did 24 hour DJ sessions
<Shizuka> 13wat no
<CrystalPhoenix> that melody....
<BlaxBlain> Zombiu is a zombie game for wiiu :3
<Shizuka> 13it's viviisbestpony
<killerpony7733> Rex_Mundi But there i would say they are magically duplicated ponies or cloned if you like. They are only kept in those forms by magic. Ergo magic ponies meaning whatever magical energies they are made of is put back in the pond
<Shizuka> 13OOPS
<Yavos> @hurrdurr is that an official request?
<CrystalPhoenix> makes me think of My little Pony
<killerpony7733> Rex_Mundi Not actual real living and real ponies.
<Lil_B> Handsome_Jack Zombi Apocalypse in London, you have to survive
<hurrdurr10> yes
<vcrmaster> @Yavos How does one tell?
<Kurra> meow
*Handsome_Jack goes to google
<Shizuka> 13Rex_Mundi: well consider this, we see that staring into the mirror pool causes your clone to come up out of it, so the audience is always seeing the prime equestria
<Everlasting_Joy> killerpony7733: If you want another show that does this, look at "Fairly OddParents", the episode "Too many Timmies".
<Yavos> @vcrmaster just request it and we add it to the list ;)
<Shizuka> 13clones can summon more clones from the pool but the camera stays in the main universe
<SuperBrony64> 11,02ZOMG UPDATE
<hurrdurr10> oh ok
<twilight_sprinkle> дфд
<hurrdurr10> thank you yavos
<twilight_sprinkle> *lal
<vcrmaster> *Yavos Okay, just curious.
<Bronysith> i love none piece
<Shizuka> 13so twilight sending the pinkies back was literally sending them back to whatever form they were in the pool
<Handsome_Jack> well...better change my nickname back to normal
<YokusaHHart> Nintendo is trolling you
<Kurra> There's Pinkie, and then first, second, to nth derivatives of Pinkie are all Pinkie Prime. Calculus saves the day!
<Jelonheoh> there we go
<Shizuka> 13shana: nice try
<J_E_Smith71> Is this for even playing games?
<shana> I had to try it :D
<shana> Shizuka: so you get notified for failed attempts?
<J_E_Smith71> The update I mean
<BlaxBlain> Pinkie Pie is serious buisness.
<Shizuka> 13eeyup
<killerpony7733> Everlasting_Joy Eh i watch cartoons for enjoyment not to seriously ponder what this and that happens. Maybe i do participate in a conversation or discussion but i usually never go beyond that making it change what i think.
<shana> neat ^_^
<Lil_B> Handsome_Jack you loose when you die, and loose everything, to get your Stuff back you Start as a new Person and must find yourself as a Zombi, other than that, you can't pause the game, Menue is on the Pad, the Zombies don't stop
<DeerioJim> and now JJ can play "guess the requester"
<Kurra> dx/dP Pinkie = nPinkie^n-1
<Jelonheoh> what i dont understand is how a clone creates a clone. its a clone of a clone. wouldnt it be deffective?
<JohnnyNorthrain> Thank you all, I've been around a collective 8 hours and never found this stream dull
<twilight_sprinkle> shana: what were you trying to do:P

<vcrmaster> *Johnny How long has this stream been going?
<killerpony7733> Everlasting_Joy My common sense just generally says to me it's for children and it's probably gonna be kept at that level and what else.
<JohnnyNorthrain> 22 hours
<Everlasting_Joy> killerpony7733: I agree, somewhat, but my point is, I feel people are taking this subject to a pointless end.
<majsman12> draw scootalo dancing
<AlexSparkle> the time, it flies, i need to shower now
<J_E_Smith71> LETS-A GO!
<Bakpony> can you donate using paypal on your donate page?

<Everlasting_Joy> They're analyzing this not because it's worth analyzing, but because they want attention.
<Tomtortoise> @Bakpony, I believe you can
<Shizuka> 13Everlasting_Joy: more occam's razor, twilight's sending mirror pinkies back to the mirror universe, and because she never targets the prime pinkie we don't know if the spell would even work on non-mirror ponies
<Jelonheoh> its a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone
<Kurra> Seriously, Bowser needs a hobby.
<BlaxBlain> I don't think that is the case joy
<Starfire86> Request: Humanized or just as ponies Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash Sitting on a bed with RD comforting Flutters
<Rex_Mundi> Just because its a childrens program, doesnt meen we cant discuss major plot points and devises and simply dismiss it as a childrens show.
<JohnnyNorthrain> @bakpony Yes you can, I did
<BlaxBlain> Guys look a video game!
<Cypresswolf> :O How DARE he take the cake!
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: That too. I refer you back to "Too many Timmies".
<J_E_Smith71> Just a typical day in the Mushroom Kingdom
<YokusaHHart> OMG Peach is getting kidnapped! What a twist!!!
<Shizuka> 13it's entirely possible that if twilight were to target pinkie prime with the spell, it wouldn't work at all
<killerpony7733> Everlasting_Joy Ah but honestly? it's fun and pretty cool to see and listen to it makes you think more but in my case never changes squat on what i know and think of the show
<Shizuka> 13i forget too many timmies
<Yavos> Oh, it's in dollars... that makes it easier :3
<Shammy> moop
<Shizuka> 13haven't seen fairies in... aaaages
<Herp> How do you think Lauren faust looks like a Pony?
<Rex_Mundi> Shizuka: Twilight mentions that it says in the book that she can accidentally send the real pinkie back
<BlaxBlain> GUYS watch the vidja game already!
<Bakpony> yay!
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: It was one of the first episodes of the show, so... Yeah.

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Let's do this :D

<Kurra> XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Canebridge> Epic start, epic start
<Tomtortoise> XD, YES!
<Everlasting_Joy> killerpony7733: It's okay to analyze something, even on a strange tangent. What irritates me is that people are analyzing something that doesn't need/deserve analysis. Kind of like pondering what ifs.
<JohnnyNorthrain> Sonic vs Rainbow Dash & Spitfire
<MMC> @<Starfire86> was thinking the same thing, but with them on a cloud watching a sunset
<Kurra> Haha he's a coon suiter!
<Yavos> @Starfire added
<Caramel_Colours> General Request: Rainbow Dash as Sonic! xD
<BlaxBlain> Cmon joy lets just KILL THE SUBJECT
<Venusy> Sonic and Rainbow Dash. Kart/boat/plane racing.
<Kandarihu> Ah, Fying Squirrel Mario!

<J_E_Smith71> Hey don't touch that squirrels' nuts
<Yavos> @DeerioJim the auction will only last during that stream
<Venusy> (I've been playing a lot of All-Stars Racing Transformed)
<King_Kai> magic is an omnipotent, semi-sentient energy form that when applied to the physical universe, has a variety of interesting effects. The source of this energy and the variety of its effects can be applied to an altrenate dimention, reffering to the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th dimentional views. This dimention is effected by sentient thought and emotion and exists outside of the time-space continuom. This allows it to affect this and probably m
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: The plot of "TMT" is the very same as "Too Many Pinkies" yet I haven't heard people raising alarms at Butch or FoP itself as a promoter of genocide.
<Yavos> @DeerioJim so about 2 hours 15 minutes left to bid
<killerpony7733> Everlasting_Joy True you should never strain yourself and get really frustated on it. But i consider it healthy however to ask a few when and why and what else.
<Kurra> Yahyah, tanuki.
<BlaxBlain> No king kai stop it!
<Shizuka> 13Everlasting_Joy: yeah people going OMG TWILIGHT MURDERER are ignoring the mechanic of the pool
<DeerioJim> @Yacos that is why I wondered if you could change the time. might be no bids because poeple think they got 2 days left
<SuperBrony64> 11,02./)3-
<Derpy_Hooves> LOL
<Lil_B> xD
<Starfire86> @MMC that would be really cute too
<Shizuka> 13if you were merely killing the alt pinkies they wouldn't be sent to the pool
<Venusy> 2hrs 15, isn't it?
<Yavos> nope, it's not changeable
<killerpony7733> ^
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: Or just making a stupid joke of the scene
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: That, all of that.
<King_Kai> thats my view on magic.
<patec> for the record: Tsitra360 just entered the chat.
<Yavos> @Vensy yes
<BlaxBlain> My little pony is serious buisness!
<Jelonheoh> and on this episode of: That Weird chat
<Shizuka> 13that they *are* sent to the pool just raises questions of how the pool fits into the cosmology of equestria
<Tomtortoise> Keep donating everyone!
<BlaxBlain> Cheese n Rice LET IT GO!
<YokusaHHart> Ponies: Serious Business
<Bakpony> i will soon
<Bakpony> first i need to think of a request
<Jelonheoh> atleast twilight wasnt the one to try and clone herself. that would be a disaster
<twilight_sprinkle> well, i suspected that her magic might not even work on the real pinkie, but it still was somewhat disturbing how she killed them all off, they were alive after all.unless theyre a part of some collective magical consciosness of the pool or something, then i guess they would not die
<Lil_B> when the pool appeared I said "Yay, more magical locations for FanFic writers!"
<Shizuka> 13hey if star wars geeks can have the gravitational constant for planets not even featured in the films, we can debate multiverse mechanics in mlp

<Lil_B> Rex_Mundi normal is without the mushroom
<Everlasting_Joy> Rex_Mundi: Small sized Mario is the normal size.
<Kurra> win
<alexxm> Rex_Mundi i thought they made him giant

<aniderp> middle bloxk
<Lil_B> middle one!
<shana> well in super mario kart they give you a boost
<Kandarihu> I grew up on both Mario and Popeye and figured that Mario's relationship with Mushrooms is similar to Popeye's relationship with Spinach.
<Yavos> @bakpony added
<Yavos> Yes, he is in the call
<Nirual> this eyup aria
<King_Kai> I seriously
<King_Kai> cannot
<Rex_Mundi> Imagine a game where Bowser is Kidnapped and the player has to save him from Peach.
<J_E_Smith71> King_Kai: Trapped with what?
<DeerioJim> europtrip to amsterdam
<King_Kai> change
<King_Kai> my

<J_E_Smith71> King_Kai: Try refeshing the stream and put in your other name?
<Bakpony> thank you yavos :)
<patec> Caramel_Colours yes he is
<Caramel_Colours> Can anybody mind telling Tsitra that I put my request that he did for me as my Home screen on my phone? That would make him happy if somebody would tell him. :)
<chitti> i am chitti
<J_E_Smith71> I mean refresh the chat
<Shizuka> 13don't bother refreshing the bronystate stream atm, i'm trying to figure out why twitch.tv's embedding sucks so much
<Barbetos> lawl
<J_E_Smith71> King_Kai: I meant refresh chat not the stream
<Barbetos> xsplit is the way to go for twitch.
<DoctoDoctorWho1> somehow my nick is in use without me being there, interesting.
<Bakpony> ugh
<Octavia_> Speaking about me.? XD
<Yavos> So did I understand that right? The new Galacon location is already set?
<DoctoDoctorWho1> And I still get pinged from King_Kai
<DoctoDoctorWho1> Interesting...
<Lil_B> the music that plays when the red coins appear is exacly like the music in Yoshi's Island
<Kujo_Jojo> same thing happened to me last night DoctoDoctorWho
<alexxm> how are you supposed to find out that the hidden passage is there first playthrough
<Rex_Mundi> I wonder if Extra lives are as pointless as they are in Galaxey, Sunchine, and 64
<shana> coins leading the way alexxm
<Weatherhoof> For a month by now - yes
<Skystorm> i've read it will be in a huge castle near stuttgart
<Perrydotto> No :I
<Lil_B> alexxm search everywhere... and probably not on the first Playthrough anyway :Ü
<DoctoDoctorWho1> Rex_Mundi: Galaxy wasnt that bad,
<Perrydotto> It's next to a castle
<J_E_Smith71> That's bone chilling
<Perrydotto> Not IN the castle
<Perrydotto> Reading helps, haha
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Vocal Music: Jastrian - I'll Fly / Crystal Uprising / A Dash of Failure
<Skystorm> oh okay :/
<Perrydotto> I wish we had the castle, but that's not really doable
<BlaxBlain> I'm back
<Bakpony> Wheee!
<Tomekke> is the castle visitable?
<Skystorm> we conquer the castle
<Weatherhoof> http://www.forum.ludwigsburg.de/,Len/start/Organizer.html
<Bakpony> i gave 15 :)
<Skystorm> we are enough people
<DeerioJim> I doze off and then I hear people talk about eggs and pouches
<Latiken> All the funfunfun would trash the castle.
<YokusaHHart> dead
<alexxm> that was easy
<patec> Thank you Bak!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02extra lives in Galaxy pointless? lol no
<Yavos> I have no idea where I could read about it, since your galacon website still isn't back up (at least not the new one)
<YokusaHHart> that yoshi looks stoned.....
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Switching games~
<J_E_Smith71> Hey random power uo down there
<Perrydotto> It actually is now
<Kandarihu> This game is giving off VERY strong SMB3 and SMW vibes
<Perrydotto> It's still a WIP
<Perrydotto> But we are working on it
<Tomtortoise> XD Siri
<BlaxBlain> But alot easier
<Tomtortoise> Didn't someone request Twilight Vs. Siri?
<Rex_Mundi> *looks at new EqD post... metal core?... ew
<Lil_B> Kandarihu that's the Point
<J_E_Smith71> SuperBrony64: Sonic next?
<Skystorm> aren't you tired perry?
<CrystalPhoenix> Hey SB what's your 3ds friend code?
<MakerDusk> Perrydotto: how are you still awake?!!
<Lil_B> Nintendo tries to make new Mario Games "Sunshine, Galaxy" and with the "New Super Mario Bros"-Games they wanna please people who want the Sidescroller Mario back
<MakerDusk> hello, fesoferbex
<JohnnyNorthrain> I'm ok with that future
<MakerDusk> welcome back
<Yavos> @Tom yes, someone requested that
<fesoferbex> i'm back for a 3rd time
<Lil_B> but not everyone gets that, what results in a lot of hate for the New Super Mario Bros games :/
<Nirual> this future sucks, where the hell is my jetpack?
<CrystalPhoenix> The problem is they don't give anything fresh
<Kandarihu> Lil_B, I see. But I'd still expect some originality in the side-scrolling aspect of NSMB.
<CrystalPhoenix> they haven't for a little while now
<Bakpony> i should be more active in the german community
<YokusaHHart> I think I'm the olny person who actually liked Sunshine
<YokusaHHart> only*
<Everlasting_Joy> YokusaHHart: Nope.
<Rex_Mundi> I liked sunshine
<BlaxBlain> I love sunshine
<Buytoast> Someone is talking bad about Sunshine?
<Kandarihu> YokusaHHart, no you aren't. I enjoyed it too
<Yavos> @Tomtortoise to be exact, it was LotrPony
<JohnnyNorthrain> I should be more active in the German community also, even though I am in America
<BlaxBlain> I LOVE LOVE sunshine
<YokusaHHart> yay! :)
<CrystalPhoenix> YokusaHHart, I love sunshine
<CrystalPhoenix> sunshine had some nice twist
<Yavos> @Bakpony you should (I should too xD)
<Lil_B> CrystalPhoenix that's the point, they try with new Powerups and new modes, but they can't change the generall Syle
<Rex_Mundi> What I disliked, was Peaches voice that stuck with all the games afterward.
<DeerioJim> I could be more active, period
<fesoferbex> Tsitra got his mike working?
<Yeti> hey everypony, I'm back
<fesoferbex> mic*
<Tomtortoise> 1001 EUROS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<BlaxBlain> So it ruined the whole game huh?

<Tomekke> I can speak some sentences :3 ?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02aniderp: Sure :)
<Kandarihu> I don't mind Peach's voice all that much. But the voice they have for Slippy and Toad to replace the previous VA sounds like a scratchy monster of some kind.
