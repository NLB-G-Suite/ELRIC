<GilDash> Wow... four minutes and only a bot post? :S
<MadSurge> :O
<GilDash> I know, right?
<MadSurge> Hello GilDash :3
<GilDash> MadSurge: Holla! :)
<Meanwhile> Chat be all quiet and shit.
*Bronysith licks Meanwhile
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: hello aniki <3
<MadSurge> I was busy listening to creepy soundtracks
<[Alpha]> just got mirc and now I'm confuse
<[Alpha]> d
<Socks> Hello
*Bronysith sets Socks on fire
<Moopy> yo whats up everypony
<Dken2021|Pokemon> allo!
*Socks writhes on the floor in pain
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hey Bronysith.
<GilDash> Moopy: Hmm... ceiling. I'd imagine the roof beyond that, and then there's the sky...
<Moopy> wha huh
<Meanwhile> Up is the opposite of down.
<Meanwhile> It is generally referring to the space above the subject in question.
<GilDash> Astute observation there!
<MadSurge> Anything you know is wrong, black is white, up is down and short is long
<Meanwhile> Oh I know, I am an astute observation machine.
<Meanwhile> But of course, no one makes astute observations like Gaston.
<GilDash> And a bloody sarcastic one at that. :p
<Moopy> well anyways sorry i left the chat last night i went to bed and i almost got caught but i didn't whew that was close
<Dken2021|Pokemon> the little plastic tips on shoelaces are called aglets, they have pure sinister purpose
<MadSurge> Sarcasm is great :)
<GilDash> Dken2021|Pokemon: What? You mean so you can actually tie your shoes?
<Meanwhile> The whores and the politicians will look up and shout "Save us!" and I'll whisper "I'm on rainbow road."
<GilDash> Can we get rid of the bankers too?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: so how are you today?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm OK.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wishing I could run.
<Moopy> so im guessing wrek streaming right?
<Dken2021|Pokemon> mmhmm
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: your legs broken?
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Injury?
<Moopy> Sweet
<Meanwhile> The whores and the politicians will look up and shout "Save us!" and I'll whisper "No." Then the whore will turn to the politician and ask "What'd he say?"
<Moopy> i was feeling sick yesterday
<Meanwhile> Because really can you hear someone whispering from the top of a building when you're on the ground? Because I can't.
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350664531124.png
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GilDash: Maybe. Having foot pains. Been soaking my foot. It's helping.
<Chrysalis> ohai wrek stream
<eosforos911> who is streaming and is this his fighting theme 4 real?
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: get ur sexy plot on planetside 2 and skype call with us bro
<eosforos911> her*
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Oh shit.
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: I've got my ankle acting up, but that's because I've been running too hard. Now my knee's acting up as well, and I've no idea why. -_-
<eosforos911> i mean her
<Socks> Meanwhile XD
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Found lapiz lazuli, redstone, and gold
<killerpony7733> Bronysith Are you guys still in a call cause i'm not in it anymore. Had a quick shower before going into the game
<Chrysalis> Bronysith once im patched
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GilDash: Yeah. Irritates me since I want to get in shape. I'm still doing other exercises, but I don't get the same burn as with jogging.
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: the call ended
<GilDash> This is why I need a new PC. :(
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: okay
<killerpony7733> Bronysith Ah for what reason?
<Moopy> i don't know what was going on inside my stomach but i was barfing and i didn't feel any good so yeah
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: Wrek is om nom nomming
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: I've only really got running for now. Thinking about swimming and getting back into kettlebelling though.
<Meanwhile> The reason you're ill is because you've angered the lord.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I'm the Lord in my own house, thank you.
<Meanwhile> And he has sent an angel to infest your digestive system until you repent.
<killerpony7733> Bronysith Well good timing i guess. So i'll have my hair dry in just a bit
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: dont you be getting religious on us
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: i thought you were smarter than that =_=
<Meanwhile> I'm sure no one will be offended by that sentence at all Sith.
<Moopy> Heh wrek getting back on the mic
<Chrysalis> Bronysith no call
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: but someone might start something. then we would have to stop it
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: cause Wrek is om nom nomming
<Chrysalis> kk
<Chrysalis> just signing in now
<Moopy> but i feel better anyways
<Meanwhile> You have been disconnected due to lack of faith.
<GilDash> Faith in what? Microsoft? XD
<Dken2021|Pokemon> and what? let everyone wail on you while afk?
<Meanwhile> Praise be to Bill Gates. Amen.
<Chrysalis> hmm wrek still eatin for now then?
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350626568937.jpg
<Chrysalis> time to kill
<Wrek> 05still logging in and all
<Bronysith> Wrek: well the skype call is off
<Moopy> eeyup
<Meanwhile> So how many of you have accepted Bill Gates as your lord and saviour?
<GilDash> He's a good guy, but he's hardly my 'lord and saviour'.
<Moopy> I saw a rainbow yesterday and it was bright and awesome
<Meanwhile> Repent unto Gates and he will forgive your sins. And then he'll fix Windows.
<Dken2021|Pokemon> Meanwhile I already accepted Arceus in my life
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I don't believe that one damn bit. :P
<Meanwhile> Ikr? that was the most unbelievable part of this spiel.
<Wrek> 05raptor jesus is my lord, sexual lobster is my prophet
<GilDash> I mean, how do you fix Windows? Honestly, even the most deluded would see through that. XD
<Meanwhile> Raptor Jesus I'm familiar with, but I've never heard of Sexual Lobster.
<Chrysalis> wrek has the best music
<GilDash> I think I've heard of sexual lobster once or twice.
<Dken2021|Pokemon> simple, you get some glass, some metal, and some tools
<GilDash> Holy crap, I made a pun in that Windows joke and never even realised. :S
<Meanwhile> I can see through Windows.
<GilDash> So can I... I laugh at the Mac users on the other side. :D
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> What the hell?
<BladedWings> ASoftFluffyThing|MC: quiet frankly, i dont know lol
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Oh my god, water EVERYWHERE
<GilDash> There isn't water in hell.
<Invi> not?
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> But there is in mineshafts
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> And I lost where I was going
<Meanwhile> It'd be quite interesting if hell was actually tepid.
<GilDash> That depends... what would you do whilst in hell?
<BladedWings> roast marshmallows?
<Meanwhile> Roast chicken.
<Dken2021|Pokemon> watch infomercials for all eternity
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Robot hell seems awesome
<pony_1887> Dark_Horst<3
<Dark_Horst> sup
<Invi> Wasn't there a guy who proved that the hell is frozen? :D
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Or you know, play a few rounds of poker with Robo Santa
<Meanwhile> Yeah well, I'll just make my own hell. With Blackjack and hookers.
<GilDash> Robot hell, hm?
<Dken2021|Pokemon> it's like hell, but for robots
<BladedWings> Meanwhile: you know what, for the hell and the blackjack!
<GilDash> Are you sure it's not hell made out of robots?
<BladedWings> *forget
<Panda> O_O robot hell?
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Infinite amounts of redstone, I guess?
*Panda is suddenly christia
<Panda> christian*
<GilDash> Aye. Robot hell... the singularity in motion...
<Invi> Panda, what now?
<Meanwhile> What would hell made of robots even look like?
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Mechanical
<Invi> robotical
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> But probably full of rusty robots
<GilDash> That reminds me, I've got to go watch trailiers for The Prototype now.
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Who haven't gotten a nice dosage of WD40 in forever
<[Alpha]> geez it was a pain setting mirc
<Meanwhile> Wandering over the battered husks of Wall-E and a bomb disposal robot and the animatronic T-Rex from Jurrasic Park?
<Panda> Invi, I dont like robots and if there are in hell... I'm gonna praise a god XD
<Invi> hehe
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda: but what if god is a robot
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Nah...I don't think Wall-E would be in there
<Invi> Panda, brace yourself, robots are coming the next few centuries :D
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Now Jaws, maybe
<GilDash> Robots are already here.
<Panda> twilight_sprinkle O_O no
<Invi> that too
<GilDash> The singularity is in motion...
<Panda> Invi NO!
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> I must be near a mineshaft. I see diamon and gold
<BladedWings> ASoftFluffyThing|MC: and maybe the T-rex from Jurassic Park
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda: your computer is a robot, ,just without hands or legs :P
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> BladedWings, or maybe the Jaws from Jaws 3D
<[Alpha]> wow
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> And Jaws 3D was and is a HORRIFIC mess
<GilDash> Robots aren't sapient yet though.
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Hell, he shard didn't even look real
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: or maybe thats what they want us to think
<Meanwhile> Anyone seen the trailer for the Jaws 4 movie?
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Spielberg's shark was robotc yea but it didn't look it
<Meanwhile> The tagline is "This time, it's personal"
<Moopy> hey wrek this music is great i love it
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Meanwhile: No and I don't think I want to, the movie is that horrific
<GilDash> Okay, The Prototype is looking awesome.
<Meanwhile> this is a movie about a giant shark. "This time, it's personal."
<Meanwhile> I love the implication that somehow this massive fish is somehow looking for vengeance.
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> I think that's the one where the shark follows Brody's wife or something when she travels someplace
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> I don't know.
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> I only saw the NC review
<Meanwhile> Beware, if you wrong a shark it's descendants will hunt you down.
<Invi> Panda, technically, a snack automat is already a robot
<Meanwhile> My name is Jaws Montoya, you killed my father. Prepare to die.
<AJIsAwesome|Asleep> :D
<GilDash> Anything that works without a human directly controlling it and is programmed is pretty much a robot.
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Meanwhile, they killed the baby shark AND the mother shark too
<Cranberry_Scotch> I was going to ask if anyone knew a good place to download the Remastered Dragon Ball Z episodes, but since we're not allowed to post links right now, I won't
<[Alpha]> 9 hmm
<Meanwhile> Colour boot to the head.
<GilDash> Cranberry_Scotch: You can always get someome to PM the links to you.
<Cranberry_Scotch> True
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Mmm, tastes like lime...
<BladedWings> ASoftFluffyThing|MC: then daddy shark is pissed :D
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Fuck. Valuable redstone gone
<Meanwhile> for sharks family honour is a very important thing.
<BladedWings> ASoftFluffyThing|MC: how is it just gone?
<Eli> ah lasagne... fraking delicious
<GilDash> Mmm... lasagne...
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> It was directly over a large lava bed and it fell in
<GilDash> Got some of that in the freezer, actually.
<BladedWings> oh...well that'll do it XD
<twilight_sprinkle> ohai Eli
<Eli> GilDash: it's better fresh :)
<Eli> hi twilight_sprinkle
<Invi> GilDash, what Eli said
<GilDash> Eli: It was fresh before I put it in there! :D
<GilDash> Could hardly let it go to waste though, could I?
*Panda slaps GilDash around a bit with a large trout
<Invi> depends on if spinacjh was in there >.>
*GilDash cuts Panda into two with a herring. Then makes a shrubbery.
<Eli> Invi: no spinach ever touches my lasagne
<GilDash> Spinach? In my lasagne? Are you mad?!
<Invi> ikr? there is a store which sells that stuff...
<BladedWings> too late Wrek lol
<Eli> spinach isn't even healthy
<Meanwhile> I like spinach.
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Spinach is delicious
<GilDash> I can stand it, but I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan...
<ASoftFluffyThing|MC> Makes for an awesome salad
<Invi> my mum accidently bought it and I thought the lasagne would be scruffy
<AJIsAwesome|Asleep> GilDash: Same here.
<Eli> Invi: my mom somethimes puts it in hers... makes it more "italian"
<GilDash> Actually, I like practically no vegetables at all... now, FRUIT on the other hand!
<Panda> GilDash you muffukka! you just killed an endangered animal!
<Dken2021|Pokemon> hmm, spinich e?
<Dken2021|Pokemon> *eh
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: ever have spinach artichoke dip
<Meanwhile> No.
<Invi> GilDash, fruits are sweet, vegetables not ^^
<GilDash> Panda: Umm... hang on a sec...
<Eli> GilDash: i like some vegetables. but yeah fruits are better
*GilDash sows Panda back together.
<Meanwhile> sews.
<GilDash> Panda: All good? ^_^;
<twilight_sprinkle> fruit ftw
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Knew I'd spelt that wrong. Thanks SpellCheck! ^_^
<Meanwhile> Np.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Do you still bother with colour at all? XD
<Eli> now excuse me while i go downstairs and get me another serving of lasagne
<BladedWings> Meanwhile is best spell check
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> ^
<GilDash> Eli: Lucky git...
<Barbetos> Can I ask for 10 seconds of silence. Something awful has happened. Big Tex, the Texas State Fair mascot, went up in flames, and is now gone.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: oh shit, thats ur cutie mark
<Barbetos> RIP Big Tex.
<Barbetos> =((
<Meanwhile> GilDash: No, I've just pretty much accepted that an entire nation was raised to spell it wrong.
<Barbetos> Thanks gusy
<Barbetos> =P
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Barbetos: Crap, that sucks.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I know... such a shame, isn't it? And just think, we almost had them...
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont remember if it was a fruit or vegetable, but a while ago i remember seeing on discovery science, a show where they were talking about a food that can taste like anything that is your favorite food, somehow related to yer brain
<Meanwhile> GilDash: Why would we want them.
<Invi> wb [Alpha]
<Dken2021|Pokemon> twilight_sprinkle interesting
<[Alpha]> last time I try that
<GilDash> Meanwhile: ... Manual labour?
<BladedWings> twilight_sprinkle: i would like to see this food
<Invi> [Alpha], try what?
<Meanwhile> GilDash: Eh, maybe.
<Blako> I'm just ripping music from Spyro 2 and there are also speeches in all the languages and the deutsch sounds so funny :D I think I'll play the game in deutsch
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I would suggest cannon fodder, but we don't need any more friendly fire. :D
<Invi> twilight_sprinkle, how would it taste if you have no favourite food?
<Meanwhile> Hahaha
<Barbetos> 10 mins of ps2!
<BladedWings> Invi: like nothing i assume
<Eli> right now, i don't need my favourite food. lasagne is close enough
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: wow :\
<Invi> BladedWings, or everything at once?
<BladedWings> Invi: i think that would be overload lol
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: whats your favorite food?
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: It's a joke... :p
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: i don't think anything can copy a good chicken curry
<twilight_sprinkle> Invi: perhaps depending on somethingyou crave or need
<[Alpha]> using colred text in mirc
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: Oh gods yes...
<MecidTheGermanBrony> Good evening
<BladedWings> ohai MecidTheGermanBrony
<Dken2021|Pokemon> evening MecidTheGermanBrony
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: Sorry, that was for Eli, not you. XD
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Hi, MecidTheGermanBrony. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: but the way it works, i think, is that your brain copies it, so it can i believe. although i dont know or remember much about that
*MecidTheGermanBrony eats donut
<Invi> [Alpha], yeah. apparently you haven't read the rules ^^
<GilDash> Yeah, coloured text is an auto-kick.
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: the texture still wouldn't work
<BladedWings> beep beep im a cloud
<Invi> meow, i am a dog
<GilDash> Woof, I'm a crocodile.
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Moo, I'm a fish.
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: but youve tasted it before, and youre eating something, so perhaps the brain could replicate the taste by memory
<BladedWings> baaaa, i'm a girraffe
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: it probably doesnt work perfectly of course
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome|MK7: whats mk7?
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Mario Kart 7. :3
<Socks> Squeek, I'm a butterfly
<[Alpha]> I prefer to discover the rules. Makes it interesting but I already have at least some common courtesy when it comes to chat due to prior knowledge
<twilight_sprinkle> ah k
<Invi> twilight_sprinkle, what stuff would taste like that?
<Dken2021|Pokemon> Caww, I'm a mouse
<twilight_sprinkle> [Alpha]: heh same
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: i don't think i have that good of a memory. which is good. everytime i taste chicken curry it's like a whole new dish
<Invi> *what stuff was it?
<twilight_sprinkle> Invi: what mean do u
<Invi> twilight_sprinkle, that stuff that tastes like favourite food
<Ryunosuke> afternoon all :)
<Invi> hai Ryunosuke
<BladedWings> ohai Ryunosuke
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Hi, Ryunosuke. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Invi: its own taste? idk, im not sure that can be easily determined if it tastes like anything
<Eli> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAH
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Ryunosuke
<Eli> that's what i think of CSI miami
<Invi> and what is that foof of all foods called?
<Invi> *food
<[Alpha]> well hmm
<Meanwhile> Food Squared?
<GilDash> I *love* chicken curry. My favourite's a dipiaza at the moment.
<twilight_sprinkle> Invi: i dont remember, i saw it on discovery several years ago
<GilDash> *Dopiaza
<Ryunosuke> patches \
<Ryunosuke> patching all day every day :)
<Dken2021|Pokemon> Shrimp Pasta, possibly my favorite dish ever
<Invi> twilight_sprinkle, aw, then i'll ask the allmighgty google
<twilight_sprinkle> Invi: dont forget to offer your sacrifices
<Eli> GilDash: looks good. i prefer it with rice tho. good old indian way
<GilDash> Eli: Can't be arsed with rice. Double naan breads for me, please! :D
<Invi> I'm already in the temple of the internet, twilight_sprinkle. the sacrifice is sanity and social life :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Invi: good, good, that is the internet's favorite foods
<GilDash> Sanity? What's that now?
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: i thought it was souls....
<[Alpha]> well I already dislike mirc
<Invi> [Alpha], I use Hexchat
<Bronysith> Gangnam style , love it so much
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: that too, innocence in particular
<[Alpha]> Is it any better?
<Bronysith> best song of 2012
<twilight_sprinkle> [Alpha]: i dont like mIRC, the only advantage it has is you can see name changes and kicks/bans
<Invi> xD I found a bacon salt for vegetarieans to tatse the bacon
<Eli> Bronysith: it's funny, and the dance is kinda cool because everyone can do it, but it's not a good song
<Bronysith> Eli: it is not a good song... it is an AMAZING SONG
<Hat> Does anyone know the name of a movie where someone is in a hotel room and every time he tries to escape he ends up in the room again?

<twilight_sprinkle> i think it was 22nd
<Bronysith> and IGN said that Black ops has the best video game ending of all time
<[Alpha]> I'll just use normal chat
<Bronysith> not a reliable source twilight_sprinkle
<Erdrick> Hat: 1408
<Dken2021|Pokemon> Bronysith does it?
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Well, there can be no best video game ending, IMO.
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: its one of the best sources there is
<Invi> Hat, do you have more info?
<Meanwhile> Hat: 1408?
<Hat> That might be it thanks

<Bronysith> Nobsi: jokes are meant to be funny
<Arcshod> So, the chat window in the stream isn't loading for me. Is this a thing that is your problem or mine?
<Jerry> Johnny Guitar <3
<Stormy`> I'm curious what everyone will say when I'm buying them though :P
<LadyCanary> Who is burping :|
<Nobsi> Bronysith i could copy a entire wikipedia post about jokes and youll never read that they are meant to be funny
<Kimori> Is that figure your trying to get supposed to be real valuable?
<scout19_tf2> this backround music dosent really match the setting
<pony_007393> Nobsi: joke/j≈çk/ Noun:	 A thing that someone says to cause amusement or laughter, esp. a story with a funny punchline.
<Stormy`> "I'm buying a pony for a friend in Canada" "Okay..."
<[Alpha]> Wikipedia :S
<Jerry> its fallout music, it fits everthing, no exceptions x)
<Stormy`> Kimori: I don't think so
<[Alpha]> What about tetris?
<Invi> Nobsi, what is then the purpose they primary serve?
<Nobsi> i found rule 34 stuff of ps2 xD
<Jerry> yeah thats too retro
<pony_007393> Nobsi: Alternatively, if you would prefer a wikipedia article...
<pony_007393> A joke[1] is something spoken, written, or done with humorous intention
<Bronysith> Nobsi: its r34, no exceptions so not really surprised
<scout19_tf2> really wut is rule 34
<Bronysith> scout19_tf2: if it exists, there is porn of it
<Jerry> scout19_tf2 no exceptions
<Nobsi> NO EXEPTIONS

<Jerry> 34,2 is There will be a Ponyfied version of it, if it exists, no exceptions
<Kimori> Why get it then? :P

<Jerry> Hey someone can tell me WHAT acually is buyable when this game is released?
<[Alpha]> no not to you to me
<Jerry> will it be outfits or also other stuff?
<Bronysith> Goku=360 (reliable but dies alot) PS3=Vegeata (tries to be the best but comes up short) Gohan=WII(had potential to be the best but is not) PC=Piccolo (powerful but overlooked)
<Kimori> lol
<Jerry> PC = Overloocked?......SON YOU WENT FULL RETARD x)
<[Alpha]> yeah...
<Kimori> If some of the pony stuff does get rare ill probably join you SR in collecting some of it
<Nobsi> dont go full retard
<Dken2021|Pokemon> what's wrong with an overclocked PC?
<Jerry> Console shitstorm is just so intense that pc seems to be overlooked in some places
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> well
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> theres collectable cards that are selling for $300 each
<Lil_B> actually... if you look at it percentage wise, the PC is a bigger market than the console market, but I don't wnna make a PC vs Consoles argument here, I like both and use both
<Jerry> Is it just me or will windows 8 make our ppc's to smartphones?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://www.ebay.ca/itm/My-Little-Pony-Foil-Rainbow-Dash-Trading-Card-F37-Very-Rare-/200819317447?pt=UK_Toys_Creative_Educational_RL&hash=item2ec1c39ac7#ht_500wt_1413
<Nobsi> im afk for some hours i need torchlight 2 to cast away the time
<Jerry> OK who did that Zoidberg sound? xD
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> that one went for more.
<Jerry> ciao Nobsi
<Invi> bye Nobsi
<Brad[Laptop]> I havent touched a console since the wii came out.
<Invi> why would you want to cast away time?
<Lil_B> Jerry yes, Win 8 was developed to be a Tablet and Smartphone OS
<LadyCanary> o3o
<Jerry> daymn...it just looks so damn ugly
<Brad[Laptop]> I don't think win8 is for smartphones.. thats windows phone 8.
<Jerry> its like a spit in the face for every Pc Purist
<Hat> People will love it because its bad
<Jerry> Brad[Laptop] you have a point there sir ^^
<Invi> Jerry, it's designed for tablet PCs
<MadSurge> LadyCanary: ^3^
<Kimori> wtf...
<Invi> and touch stuff
<Kimori> I'm just shocked lol
<Brad[Laptop]> I can see it working well on tablets
<Lil_B> Jerry it doesn't even have a proper mouse interface, it "guesses" where your cursor is, like you would use a finger... because touch interface is sooooo the future -.-
<Brad[Laptop]> but I dont like how they locked down windows RT
<Brad[Laptop]> they went walled garden apple approach
<Kimori> I wont pay full retail for a collectable
<Hat> What's with everything losing mouse support lol
<Barb|LoverPony> Poor little guy just wants to fit in.
<Jerry> they should make a Windows: Gamer with improved performance but less App, and smerhphone bullshiaaaat
<Invi> Lil_B, I hate that touch trend thingy >.>
<Kimori> If I can get it extremely cheap ill go for it
<Kimori> Ive been able to do that with most of the collectables Ive purchased
<Jerry> Apple is doing it right, eexcept the performance
<Invi> and the price
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but the thing is some collectables are fan-made, and selling for hundreds up to thousands.
<Vordox> OMG!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its not even official merchandise.
<Invi> and the sueing
<Lil_B> the actuall Issues Win8 has are actually rather small in number, but they are all major, and easily fixable/changeable, but Microsoft refuses to
<Vordox> Spirituell Sequel to Nine People, Nine hours nine doors!!!!
<Jerry> gimme a Mac which is not too fucking expensive and has the performance of a gamer pc and ill instabuy
<Kimori> For MLP?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yes
<Jerry> also it should support more games
<Kimori> oh
<Lil_B> Invi youn don't know half of the Sueing Stuff yet, believe me
<Hat> Can the soldiers be killed inside the transport like in the trailer
<Invi> Lil_B, that's what you think ^^
<Brad[Laptop]> Ive had lots of problems with my retina macbook pro.
<LadyCanary> So many accents on stream~
<Invi> dat Aerosmith <3
<Kimori> I'm not too interested in fan made stuff because it could lose value
<Lil_B> actually, the Windows "Surface" Tablet with the Keyboard costs more, than an Mac-Book
<LadyCanary> Dat Love in an Elevator
<ScootaChicken> What is this vidya garm, it looks like a CoD ripoff.
<MadSurge> LadyCanary: Ikr, it's an international stream!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you buy the fan made stuff because you like it, not because of future value.
<Hat> Planetside 2
<Invi> LadyCanary, whoow
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: its called planetside 2
<Jerry> ScootaChicken PLS be sarcastic
<Jerry> PLS
<Kimori> I don't always buy stuff because I like it
<Kimori> I buy to resell in the future
*LadyCanary giggles.
<ScootaChicken> Jerry: I'm not, most FPS games are CoD ripoffs, Moder Warfare was, like, the first good FPS.
<Kimori> Ive bought video games in the past and never opened the packages just because I know it would be worth more years from now
<DashWithRainbows> ScootaChicken Go to fackin' bed.
<ScootaChicken> All the new one are just ripoffs.
<MadSurge> Hey GilDash|Cooking, was my accent really bad when speaking english? :D
<Nobsi> yay i found a way to play games AND being online in irc
<ScootaChicken> Ashy Poo, why the feck did you leave the group.
<DashWithRainbows> Because
<Hat> This more looks like a BF ripoff, but done better
<LadyCanary> ;3;
<Jerry> ScootaChicken CoD MW doesnt ee¬¥ven have vehicles
<DashWithRainbows> reasons.
<Kimori> I planned to get some of it graded soon to make it official
<ScootaChicken> But why wub woo ;_;
<Invi> Lil_B, does it have a reason that it is that expensive?
<DashWithRainbows> Ew, gay.
*Invi pets LadyCanary ^^
<LadyCanary> :|
<Hat> Lol rammers
<Invi> :D
<Brad[Laptop]> it would be fun to get one of these for cheap. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Microsoft-Surface-Table-/251169129813?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3a7ad8c555
<Lil_B> Invi as much reason as apple has for their prices
<DashWithRainbows> Besides ScootaChicken, how recent have I been talking in the group?
<Jerry> ScootaChicken: Btw theres a difference between the same GENRE and a ripoff
<DashWithRainbows> Barely once a few days.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> everyone has their thing.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I buy stuff because I enjoy it.
<Invi> Lil_B, what really? nothing new on that thing? maybe it's because no one wants to buy it ^^
<MadSurge> So how's stuff LadyCanary? :)
<LadyCanary> Fine.
<Lil_B> woop, finally found the Kung Fu Hustle OST! in FLAC nonseless!
<Invi> wb LadyCanary ^^
<Saturn> 08,01what are you playing?
<DashWithRainbows> Most the time the conversation is about things I don't have a single clue about and well, I just got bored enough to quit it.
<Bronysith> Saturn: doom
<Lil_B> hi LadyCanary :)
<LadyCanary> Chat derp.
<Saturn> 08,01now i want to play doom
<MadSurge> Saturn: Planetside 2 :D
<Saturn> 08,01but it's only fun when people are watching
<LadyCanary> >_< Saturn! :3333
<Bronysith> Saturn: multiplayer doom sometime?
<ScootaChicken1> DashWithRainbows: Fair enough, but the chat is interesting enough most of the time for me to want to stick around.
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: sure, but i'll need to find a working source port
<Invi> DashWithRainbows, then start an own conversation about things you have a clue with one of the 110 other ponies in here ^^

<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Pony Coloring Table
<Nobsi> Jerry bake me some muffins im hungry
<ScootaChicken1> Plus I like all the people in the group and it's an easy way to communicate with all of you guys without needing to PM each one of you to find out how you guys are doing.
<Bronysith> Saturn: ahh okay, i use DOOMSday engine
<Jerry> Ask Derpy, Nobsi!
<ScootaChicken1> Or resort to going on IRC, which I basically never do these days.
<DashWithRainbows> I'm on IRC more than Skype nowadays
<Nobsi> could anyone bake me some muffins?
<Nobsi> and ship them to me?
<DashWithRainbows> unless I'm at college.
<Bronysith> Nobsi: i could, but they would be for me
<BladedWings> well guys i must be off to class....have fun with BMN and i'll see yall later :)

<Barb|LoverPony> Nothing to do wat work
<MadSurge> LadyCanary: but you're so goooood ;3;
<Kimori> Yeah but if you can make some money too why not? :)
<DashWithRainbows> Invi I just wait for something that takes my interests to come up most of the time.
<Barb|LoverPony> Make images with phone XD
<Invi> Lil_B, wat sin Zigeunerweisen?
<DashWithRainbows> Neil is forming a social life?
<ScootaChicken1> Because IRC is basically just for internet people, but I can talk to internet people on skype as well so YDK.
<DashWithRainbows> WHAT IS DIS
<ScootaChicken1> DashWithRainbows: I've always had a social life :P
<ijulkisa> hello everypony ^^

<Invi> oh okay

<ScootaChicken1> LadyCanary: :33333

<DashWithRainbows> I*
<ijulkisa> OK, by :$6_9

<ScootaChicken1> Don't change nothing though
<Stormy`> I like buying and reselling stuff in games
<Hat> This game looks epic
<Invi> oh hai Sonny ^^
<Stormy`> but I won't do it with real money
<Hat> Like 2142
<Stormy`> seems kind of risky
<Stormy`> like if you can't resell whatever it is
<Kimori> Thats why if you do you buy it at the lowest price possible
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> risk = reward
<Jerry> Hey everyone, What about a Bronystate Clan or group or something?
<Kimori> Thats what Ive done for years
<Jerry> for planet side 2
<DashWithRainbows> There already is one
<Hat> Yes! But I don't have beta
<DashWithRainbows> Wrek made it.
<Kimori> Sometimes you do lose money but you make up for it with something else
<ScootaChicken1> Jerry: That sounds like the gayest thing in the world.
<Stormy`> I was going to sell all my pokemon cards but they're not really worth anything
<ScootaChicken1> Sign me up!
<Hat> Link link
<Jerry> it will be released soon and Scoota...thx :3
<Kimori> I might be interested
<Kimori> What do you have?
<DashWithRainbows> Sorry Neil, legal people only.

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy` they are probably going to be worth more to you when you find them in a box in 10 years.
<Sonny> that was fast Lil_B xp
<Jerry> We should definietly make it after release, we could make a TS and rule everyone so hard ^^
<Stormy`> I dunno, I'll have to look through them again when I get home tonight
<Stormy`> I have a few foils
<Kimori> I only collected the first generation cards
<Stormy`> and one "eX" card or whatever
<Lil_B> Invi was earlier I think xD
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Just make sure to feed your pickachu.

<DashWithRainbows> Bronysith Already got the list sorted.
<Ninjazz> Just get a mouse, it's not that bad.
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: okay, you going to build it or is someone else gonna do it for you?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its because its got value for kids who used to have one who have kind of grown up and want to remember them.
<DashWithRainbows> Going to pay my friend's dad to do it.
<Nobsi> i dont want to wait 4 hours anymore could we start the movie now?
<DashWithRainbows> But I'll be there to watch him do so

<DashWithRainbows> I just went up to look at the list, not bad SB.
<mitamaking> The problem with ZombiU to me is it sounds like a single mode in a bigger game
<Invi> Lil_B, yeah i know that feel. that's what i just fixed

<Lil_B> NewSuperBronyU check them out if you have time, they are funny :) and the main guy has a normal and reasonable view on gaming (but mostly doesn't show it because he wants to Troll the people in the Lifechat xD)
<Invi> DaringDerpy, B movies don't have to be bad

<RaveBrony> What is this on the stream? Just turned on the audio
<Randomnerd> It's a discussion about bullying.
<CCCP> Lil_B yeah i guess, i honestly find the show pretty overrated too, doesnt mean i dont like it
<Polydunami> Well, Dark_Horst, it seems people don't like to acknowledge PT's transsexuality.
<Randomnerd> It's "Bullying Awareness Month", so it seemed appropriate.
<Dark_Horst> oh boy
<[Alpha]> IO think most of the time I'm just an observer :/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dark_Horst: There's recent stuff involving Canterlot Gardens.
<Lil_B> CCCP dude, I'm the first to admit, that I don't like half the episodes
<RaveBrony> Ah
<CCCP> :o
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And there's her/his transexuality, so she gets that.
<Eli> who's talking?
<CCCP> Lil_B im suprise
<scout19_tf2> Lil_B: wuuuuuuuuuut:O
<ScootaChicken> This story sounds like one of those greentext stories on 4chan that ends with people opening doors.
<ScootaChicken> And getting on the floor.
<AlienWarhead> Anyway thanks for listening if you guys are not actually listening I love you guys and the fandom even though both have flaws both are great
<ScootaChicken> And walking dinosaurs.

<Meanwhile> dari your hair is so bad.
<Meanwhile> Haaaah
<Lil_B> CCCP yeah, seriously, unless I have a chat to riff about it I can't take some episodes. not that they are badly written, but it's written for a younger audience, and in some sceneces, THAT really shines through
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01VenHur: Scoot-Scootaloo is streaming.
<ScootaChicken> prince-dari: XDDDDDD
<sonicdude558> orly
<[Alpha]> o.0

<AJIsAwesome|MK7> AlienWarhead: No problem. :)
<DashWithRainbows> Dari, u suk
<turtlegod98> no one at school knows i'm a brony apart from my friends some are bronies.
<Randomnerd> "Bully" was not the case, I was just mad with everyone and people avoided me.
<ScootaChicken> Oi mate, I'll fukking drop u fam
*sonicdude558 brohoofs DashWithRainbows
<turtlegod98> ok
<Randomnerd> I mellowed out in 11th grade.
<CCCP> yeah i feel like the fandom somtimes acts like the episodes are deeper than they really are somtimes Lil_B
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> sonicdude558: Love and tolerance is a somewhat flawed slogan. I don't hate it though.
<prince-dari> Fokkin drop 'im 'enry
<RaveBrony> Ah
<Meanwhile> 'Enry is well 'ard.
<VenHur> The subject of bullying is one thing that I don't want to live on this planet sometimes...that, and global warming...
<RaveBrony> THats understandable.
<Randomnerd> CCCP: See, I like the show because it's not always deep.
<ScootaChicken> 'Enry is a proper lad
<VenHur> ..and FOX News.
<CCCP> Randomnerd me too
<Randomnerd> The world is a huge, frustrating and complicated place.
<USSR> Hello everyone

<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Hi, USSR. :)
<CCCP> you!
<sonicdude558> Is this live?
<RaveBrony> I was seen as a weird until one of the cutest girls in the school fell for me :$ All the whiney bitches left me alone after that :D
<Randomnerd> It would be NICE if there was a place like Equestria.
<alexxm> how are things USSR
<RaveBrony> *weirdo
<Polydunami> Oh dear, I don't seem to recognise this person :S
<ScootaChicken> Okay, LC's story is way too meandering, could someone who was actually listening summarise it for me?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01For a few years in high school, I hated everyone.
<USSR> I could've came in as SFSR, haha
<scout19_tf2> hey USSR
<Alchemist> good evening ladies and gents.
<USSR> But things are fine
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> CCCP: The morals are deep but this show isn't really deep, in my opinion.
<AlienWarhead> hi Alchemist
<USSR> Im going to wait it out for the stream
<VenHur> Randomnerd: True, very true, but fear not, there's some things that made our hearts glee with a golden sunshine.
<Randomnerd> sonicdude558: I don't know, I'd love to have this recorded so I can listen to the whole thing leter.
<USSR> First time here
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Hi, Alchemist. :)
<Lil_B> CCCP yeah, they are not deep, the timeframe in which tehy have to come up with the Storys AND the the aimed Audfience doesn't leave room to make something deep! and I hate peoples arguments "Just look at the References!"
<sonicdude558> Hi Tom :)
<MadSurge> CCCP: Ikr, it's supposed to be for everyone, not just adults
<Polydunami> Welcome to bronystate, USSR!
<Hat> Why would someone watch a show for the references
<Lil_B> Hi USSR and and Alchemist :)
<Alchemist> what is going on in the stream?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thought anyone trying to make friends with me was doing it to troll me.

<sonicdude558> Tom? Where r u
<ScootaChicken> BetaMane
<Dark_Horst> bullies dont expect opposition
<Alchemist> hai Lil_B :)
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Hat: I agree. We shouldn't watch a show JUST for references.
<VenHur> Like video games...if it weren't for the comercial success of the Nintendo Entertainment System, we would of had E.T all over the place.
<CCCP> Lil_B: yeah lol
<RaveBrony> Nittany_Discord: I know that feel :I
<Meanwhile> I feel the need to make sure you know, it's integral to my character.

<AlienWarhead> AJIsAwesome|MK7: I have a hard time with my voice it is too deep
<Scottish-geeky-schoo> why is evry pony talking about how thay sound
<EspyLacopa> Huh. The new survey got caught by my spam filter.
<CCCP> wait if this isnt live when was it recorded?
<Polydunami> Saxy isn't even here.
<EspyLacopa> Noooo, Now I can't vote.
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> AlienWarhead: Lucky you. I was targeted BECAUSE of my voice.
<cowvarkian> Scottish-geeky-schoo: because we can
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think in July CCCP.
<VenHur> I also had a rough time with my voice...never speak most of the time...
<Scottish-geeky-schoo> cowvarkian: ok
<CCCP> Nittany_Discord thanks :)
<ScootaChicken> I don't get why Saxy would get bullied.
<ScootaChicken> He'd just be all like 'ARE YOU OKAY?'
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Plus, I was a crybaby and I was very sensitive as a kid.
<Meanwhile> Because he looks like Indian Elvis?
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome|MK7: wut O__O
<VenHur> I guess you can say i'm unsocial, a lone wolf, a man with a few words, or all three.
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> MadSurge: What do you mean?
<Polydunami> ScootaChicken <_< >_>
<Eli> AJIsAwesome|MK7: me too
<prince-dari> Saxy would just jacket them to death.
<cowvarkian> <.< I remember when someone thought I was threatening them with a bookmark
<BaconMane> 0,5Aw I missed my part
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome|MK7: what's wrong with your voice?
<BaconMane> 0,5I mean HELLO! :D
<cowvarkian> BaconMane: hey
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If I have kids, I will not tolerate them being bullied.
<EspyLacopa> Now I'm sad. This weeks newsletter, and the survey link with it, got caught by gmail's spam filter.
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Eli: If someone would tell me to shut up, even as a joke, I would break down crying.
<CCCP> hi BaconMane
<MadSurge> Hey BaconMane!
<VenHur> Hello BaconMane.
<RaveBrony> Hiya BaconMane

<cowvarkian> Nittany_Discord: why would you
<Colt_Brovakiin> heya BaconMane
<EspyLacopa> And now I can't put in my raffle vote =[
<[Alpha]> Reminds of a time when this kid used to bully me because I was a teacher's pet. I would always get candy and he would take it from me.
<AlienWarhead> AJIsAwesome|MK7: I got made of a little because of my voice, also my weight, my glasses, and other random stuff
<Eli> AJIsAwesome|MK7: oh. not that hard i guess
<RaveBrony> Yeah..
<Meanwhile> ScootaChicken: Because http://i.imgur.com/c3prC.jpg
<RaveBrony> Its been in my spam for the past 2 weeks
<cowvarkian> I remember when someone thought I was bullying them, because I was saying that you could stab someone with their bookmark...
<[Alpha]> My mom found out. She threatened to kick the little kid's @ss and his mother's
<Eli> AJIsAwesome|MK7: but i'm still very sensitive. but now i use that for being just a galant nice guy to be around :P
<RaveBrony> And yet, the 'lottery completion' email isnt spam. O_o
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> MadSurge: My voice wasn't that deep. It was very high pitched and I HATED it so much. I still don't like it today.
<ScootaChicken> Meanwhile: Groliuous.
<VenHur> If I had kids of my own, I would be like a sensei to them, and teaches my little tykes on how to roundhouse kick bullies in the face.
<scout19_tf2> cowvarkian: well dats fuqed up
<Scottish-geeky-schoo> im a potato
<Meanwhile> Violence never solves anything. Except this, it totally solves this.
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome|MK7: I'm not very deep either :P
<Algol> if I had kids, I'd teach them to Bustah Wolf them
<USSR> im a tomato
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Eli: In fact, the only TRUE friend I had was 3 years younger than me.
<sonicdude558> Not the RP
<sonicdude558> er
<cowvarkian> scout19_tf2: yeah. and my school made me so community service
<sonicdude558> s
<ScootaChicken> If I had kids (which I won't because perpetual jailbait) I'd teach them how to take the fecking banter.
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> He was basically one of the best and only friends I had.
<AlienWarhead> Anyway AJIsAwesome|MK7 thanks for the talk I'll probably be back for movie night, later
<cowvarkian> *do
<Lil_B> WOOP! the new Wrek it Ralph Trail√∂er has Dubstep XD

<prince-dari> Matt Smith can't handle my bant
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Scoot-Scootaloo: Scoots is.
*USSR yawns
<Meanwhile> Matt Smith banters dari just by existing.
<Eli> first I noticed my friends being diffrent was when they all started smoking.
<ScootaChicken> He's the D to the A add an R and then an I, cos ain't no other bluds can par that fly, he's banterlicious.
<Eli> uhhg rap
<Polydunami> inb4 kick
<Polydunami> :P
<Kawaii_icybeauti> My friends left me after one of their friends told them they didn't like me. The worst was when I sat down at their table and they left like I was sick or soemthing..
<prince-dari> ScootaChicken: You yenius
<Yahooz> Dayum, ScootaChicken laying down that verse
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Yeah, all my "friends" deserted me. They wouldn't keep secrets about me, they made fun of me (even though they knew I hated that), and they would alienate mme.
<Maid_RainBow> well everypony i have to go going to hit the hay
*ScootaChicken bows
<VenHur> Eli: Never trust smokers, never trust 'em.
<Yahooz> I gotta say... that was SO COOL. coldeven
<[Alpha]> I alienate myself
<Eli> then you did it right. you stayed yourself. i did the same, but yeah it turned out well
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> *my "so called friends"*
<prince-dari> See, I've got good friends
<Scottish-geeky-schoo> AJIsAwesome|MK7: i had that happen to me
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Did this start at 4?
<prince-dari> I totally binned one of my friend's stuff the other day
<Metronome> Highschool really is that bad?6_9
<prince-dari> Not entirely my own fault
<prince-dari> But he forgave me. :P
<Saturn> 08,01you're such a *good* friend, Dari
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Metronome: For some people, yes.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Middle school was my experience with hell
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> ^
<scout19_tf2> yea nowim not looking forward to highscholl
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> I HATED Middle School.
<prince-dari> Saturn: Pfft, it was his fault as much as mine
<Meanwhile> Middle school will kill you.
<Meanwhile> A lot.
<Eli> REAL friends are the ones who accept you just the way you are. i get some strange looks sometimes, but my best firend hangs out with me nontheless
<Algol> Best advice I can give for high school: roll with the punches
<StinkomanFan> I hate the prison theuy call the American Education System
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: another time we agree on something
<prince-dari> He didn't go and get it, and didn't ask me where it was
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Eli: Agreed.
<prince-dari> So they cleared the bins
<CCCP> i liked middle school more than i like highschool ;/
<[Alpha]> I read all through middle school. So I was fine
<prince-dari> And it was gone the next day
<prince-dari> :P
<scout19_tf2> im a serviver of middle school
<Bronysith> CCCP: that means you were the bully
<Stormy`> Going to work... be back later
<VenHur> Thanks god I never attended Middle School...
<Yahooz> Middle School is so insignifcant
<Scottish-geeky-schoo> and no pony is talking to me
<pot80_MCproject> hi guys, whats this bullying?
<VenHur> THANKS. FRIGGIN'. GOD.
<Bronysith> Yahooz: exactly
<Alchemist> Eli: real frinds help you out and warn you when you are about to do something stupid
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> pot80_MCproject: Interview about bullying.
<turtlegod98> yeah, people take advantage out of my interests like halo
<CCCP> lol
<CriticKitten> Middle school: it's basically useless

<CriticKitten> Algebra and above, cowvarkian.
<Eli> Alchemist: in german we say "zusammen Pferde stehlen" to steal horses. it's like being very close. and if he asked me to steal a horse with him, i'd do it
<prince-dari> Bullying is character building, the real world is tough, it won't treat you nicely, and you won't survive in it if you think everthing it goign to be all 'flowers and rainbows'
<CriticKitten> High school level.
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: ah, ok
<Kawaii_icybeauti> CriticKitten: Really?
<scout19_tf2> haha CCCP USSR this stream must be soviet controled
<CriticKitten> Yup.
<prince-dari> going*
<USSR> It is....
<Canadian_Brony> k thx AJIsAwesome|MK7
<Kawaii_icybeauti> CriticKitten: Jeex, where the hell do you live?
<cowvarkian> USSR: obviously
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> prince-dari: True, but it really depends on the extent of said bullying.
<USSR> The soviets control everything....FOREVVVVER

<CriticKitten> Indiana. Though it's the case in many states.

<Canadian_Brony> I wish I could be a Scott.
<Canadian_Brony> but I'm not
<Bronysith> prince-dari: yea, even though i disagree with bullying, it still is conditioning, cant stop me from hating it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Unless those people are cruel themselves.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Because we're frying our brains with television and i[hones.
<CriticKitten> Naw, it's not that
<VenHur> Scott standed up to bullies. Like a goddamn boss!
<CriticKitten> It's pure laziness
<[Alpha]> I dislike television
<CCCP> Highschool > Middleschool > Elementary school
<Alchemist> Kawaii_icybeauti: I have neither :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just gmail's bots being screwy.

<Alchemist> Kawaii_icybeauti: *on
<turtlegod98> wut?
<Eli> I think real friends is when you know, if your friend asked you to break the law with you, you would do it, but you know he would never ask you such a thing
<turtlegod98> what he say?
<cowvarkian> Eli: sure they would
<[Alpha]> Jose :P

<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: you're welcome
<Canadian_Brony> Wow. Total dicks.
<ScootaChicken> 'Your name is stupid and you're Canadian' is one of the greatest things I've ever heard.
<Scottish-geeky-schoo> AJIsAwesome|MK7: ah
<Pink3> Hallo Guys,I need some Dr Phil action for a sec, one of my friends doesnt like that i am begining to hang out with some people more popular than him (i know popular isnt neciscarily the koolest) and he wants me to lose all my riends except him,even dump my gf,which i suspect he will aask out if i do so. And the "more popular" people are actualy my friends. And he is my gfs close friend,that fact, he could probably convnce her to break
<pot80> why are people so striotypical?
<ScootaChicken> tl;dr
<CCCP> wat
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> pot80: Society.
<Meanwhile> Because people suck.
<Polydunami> Geeze, people are fucking picky.
<Meanwhile> Bottom line of the world
<CCCP> pot80 because everyone is a steriotype :3
<Shizuka> 13RaveBrony: stupid people can't read the "click here to unsubscribe" link on the newsletter they signed up for and hit the "Report spam" button instead
<RaveBrony> Ooooh
<Eli> Pink3: talk with him. you can't do that. he can't do that
<[Alpha]> Kind of the reason why I want to move into the woods :/
<Metronome> Hearing this depresses me
<cowvarkian> Pink3: choose the other people over the one guy
<Lil_B> I hate, that in 99% of all Bullying, is just to show of for others and to "be funny/though" I know so many bullys who would be so normal human beeing when you approach them alone, but when we were in groups, they act so obviously just to show off -.-
<RaveBrony> That explains it
<scout19_tf2> the only thing i have against canadains is der driveing
<pot80> CCCP: not really its just part of peoples traits put them into steriotypes, noone is an exact steriotype
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Metronome: But it's necessary to bring up. We can't keep this stuff unearthed.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> It brings memories of my experiences.
<Alchemist> Pink3: thats something I cant give you advice on. Sounds more complicated than just a few lines in a chatroom.
<Meanwhile> Because you tried to unsubscribe?
<Eli> Pink3: if he's your real friend he wouldn't ask something like that
<CCCP> WAT
<Meanwhile> Hahahahahahaha
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> .........
<Colt_Brovakiin> dafuq

<Pink3> cowvarkian: But remember he can convince my gf to dump me probbaly
<scout19_tf2> wut:O
<ScootaChicken> There's a guy at our school called Jack Benda, I think that Scott is pretty acceptable compared to that tbh.
<Scottish-geeky-schoo> Pink3: i do not know but hers one thing never let othe pepole ruel over u
<Kawaii_icybeauti> :P
<VenHur> Wait...WHAT?!
<cowvarkian> VenHur: apologize for what?

<Randomnerd> I caught mine out of the spam folder two weeks ago.
<Saturn> 08,01no, Saturn's number is 6
<ScootaChicken> Spermenting is probably one of the greatest portmanteau's I've ever heard.
<Eli> Pink3: i hope for you that will stop soon. i'm now 19 and i'm still more mature than the 22 year olds in my class
<ScootaChicken> Ever.

<CCCP> whats about /b/ronies?
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: dat austin powers

<Lil_B> I seriously dislike just how many Bronys lash out at everything that dislikes the show -.-
<Meanwhile> I was just like HNG then I had to change my shorts...
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Canadian_Brony: He does. :D
<Yahooz> cowvarkian: That my friend, is called being butthurt
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Spanish version lol
<Yahooz> its very common amongst bronies
<RosePetal> But that's because G3 was made for little children. They did not assume that adults would watch it.
<Lil_B> well... spanish scream
<pot80> I've had decent conversations with haters after talking like a mature person to them
<cowvarkian> Yahooz: Which is why I don't give a fuck about people that are 'haters'
<Meanwhile> turtlegod98: they're*
<turtlegod98> thx
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Honestly, the previous aren't all that bad. I actually kind of like G1.
<RosePetal> I love the music in mlp.

<Kimori> hi
<Metronome> I only Hate G3, G1 G2 Was OK :D
<Meanwhile> [Alpha]: Mfw I was pinged by your link.
<Canadian_Brony> RosePetal they didn't assume adults would voluntarily watch G4 either. They were thinking about the odd one or two times a parent would get dragged into it.

<cowvarkian> Shizuka: >.> uh huh
<Kimori> how goes?
<RosePetal> Oh yeah, there was no effort in the sub series animation.
<infernap12> so if im not a fully grown man yet its ok?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Shizuka: My mom thought it was a group of pedobears before attending bronycon and seeing it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They should only be concerned about the spaghetti-inducing bronies.
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: well I'm not grown so blah
<cowvarkian> fully
<scout19_tf2> Shizuka: yo fam aint know shit
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or spaghetti-producing.
<prince-dari> >spaghetti-inducing bronies
<Ryunosuke> Shizuka, just tell them its a good show, if a show is well made, ofc its going to be popular regardless of the target audience :)
<Canadian_Brony> My school got a mass-amount of bronies this year. Last year, we levelled out at a known number of 4. When the Grade 8's showed up, we almost tripled the brony population.
<Saturn> 08,01so i've come up with the best idea ever
<prince-dari> That reduncency
<Meanwhile> That's all of them
<Saturn> 08,01a brony dating site
<LadyCanary> ...
<Bronysith> Saturn: yes

<Meanwhile> That is a terrible idea
<prince-dari> redundancy*

<prince-dari> pls go
<Rocknrollpony-> Love Kung Fu Hustle
<Ryunosuke> or so bad that its funny, ie. Aquabats
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: that's doubtful

*Saturn 08,01puts an arm round Canadian_Brony, "spaghetti! spaghetti everywhere!"
<scout19_tf2> sup Lyra
<Lyra`> damnit daribot.
<RosePetal> Everyone always asumes that OCs are Mary Sues or Gary Stus. But if they are well written then there not. People need to know that.
<Lyra`> hai scout19_tf2
<Rocknrollpony-> Skeeta
*Pinkies4thWall doesn't like spaghetti
<prince-dari> >implying good OCs exist
<Polydunami> ScootaChicken is that a registered website? :|

<CCCP> implying? :s
<Saturn> 08,01huh, apparently angrysex.com is available
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kids who think that OCs need rules. Maybe in RP.

<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: psht, my OC is amazing

<RosePetal> >implying that every Oc is Mary Sue.
<Lyra`> prince-dari, my OC is a slut
<Saturn> 08,01she's a red and black alicorn
<Saturn> 08,01who is celestia's cousin
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Saturn: :D
<J_E_Smith71> Would changing Twilight into an alicorn and calling her Quuen Eos count as an OC?
<prince-dari> Lyra`: Based on yourself is it?
<prince-dari> DO HO HO
<Saturn> 08,01and bearer of the 7th elemnt of harmony
<Lyra`> how did you know?
<Lil_B> Saturn and releated to the main 6 inb every way

<Lyra`> shes a blue earth pony, and i have a picture ;3
<cowvarkian> Lyra`: random guess
<ScootaChicken> My OC is glorious: http://i.imgur.com/dFSkn.jpg
<ScootaChicken> His name is Pon Jeremy.
<LadyCanary> AJIsAwesome|MK7: Because here's where it gets TOTALLY off topic
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn . . . sorry if I sound stupid here, but WTF does spaghetti mean?
<prince-dari> LOL ScootaChicken
<Metronome> Wht is Mary Sue?
<ScootaChicken> He's the sexiest mofo in Equestria bitches.

<Saturn> 08,01my OC's CM is a cornucopia
<Meanwhile> Hahahahahahaha
<cowvarkian> Canadian_Brony: you're welcome
<LadyCanary> BRB going to kill myself.
<Metronome> Twilight is best pony
<Saturn> 08,01it's a pun
<Lil_B> Meanwhile it's still warm when you burn it
<J_E_Smith71> Metronome: An OC character added to fanfics that oversahdows the main cast, can do no wrong and is perfect in everyway
<cowvarkian> LadyCanary: cool
<ScootaChicken> [Alpha]: My glorious OC.
<Canadian_Brony> LadyCanary you will be missed :(
<Polydunami> :) <--- this Twilight is awesome

<Lyra`> also, theyre is a reason its cropped
<Meanwhile> Lyra`: That's RAVING FURIOUS SEX alright.
<Lil_B> V is best
<Polydunami> ;)
<VenHur> Oooh, Shizu is playing some Bejewled lately...
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: hah
<RosePetal> It depends if the OC does not have any flaws then it's a Mary Sue. And if the character just learns things easily then its a Mary Sue.
<CCCP> Lyra` why is it on a bed?
<cowvarkian> CCCP: because sex
<LadyCanary> That's REALLY pretty Lyra` :3
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: i had a dream about you a few nights ago!

<prince-dari> Saturn: In your opinion. :P
<Canadian_Brony> >furries
<Dark_Horst> i like how noone notices the blatant similarities between our community and the furry fandom
<Pinkies4thWall> Dari, techically, bronies are furries.
<Lil_B> well... I know Furries xD yes, there are many Foxes xD
<Chrysalis> i prefer he used to be a fury
<Polydunami> Meow :3
<Canadian_Brony> NOPENOPENOPENOPENOPE
<Chrysalis> he was so mad
<prince-dari> Pinkies4thWall: Well no, they aren't
<Chrysalis> he WAS fury
<Meanwhile> I thought this was going to be totally dull, but it proved me wrong. It's fucking hilarious.
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: well, except the ones who actually bugger goats
<scout19_tf2> prince-dari: ikr FERRIES:(
<cowvarkian> sumerpan says that in this segment RAGING FURIOUS SEX
<[Alpha]> I don't feel like I want to see it :S
<cowvarkian> Saturn: that too
<Meanwhile> cowvarkian: That's now a thing, it's happening.
<VenHur> I'm pretty sure i'm not a furry...I don't even have a Gardevoir on my Diamond and Pearl team... >_>
<Dark_Horst> prince-dari: define furry
<pot80> furries are fine people
<LadyCanary> ....
<Ryunosuke> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_leobr7Z7mO1qchw13o1_500.jpg -- twilight was mentioned earlier, this is in responce to that
<Ryunosuke> :)
*LadyCanary facedesks
<Saturn> 08,01technically, ponies are anthropomorphic animals
<CCCP> how do furries taste?
<Saturn> 08,01so we're all furries
<Metronome> ^No
<prince-dari> My definition of furries - "people who like porn (usuall drawn) involving animals (usually slightly human looking of some sort"
<Saturn> 08,01CCCP: much like anyone else
<cowvarkian> Saturn: gasp
<prince-dari> So no, we're not furries.
<prince-dari> By my definition
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Furries and bronies aren't exactly the same.
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> ^
<RosePetal> I don't clop to ponies.
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: then I'm one of those
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: that covers a small number of furries
<prince-dari> And I don't care if your definition is different.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Gardevoir is mah waifu~
<VenHur> Saturn: ...Then how can Ponies can stand on two legs in G2...?
<prince-dari> That's what furry has always, and will always mean to me.
<Canadian_Brony> prince-dari . . . no comment.
<Meanwhile> RAVING FURIOUS SEX with a horse. That's a furry.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Furries like animals. Bronies like a cartoon show.
<Metronome> Furry Likes Human animal things, Brony likes MLPFIM TV show
<Wrek> 05tehre are furries
<[Alpha]> :S
<Wrek> 05that are also bronies
<ScootaChicken> prince-dari: Yeah, the difference is that the ponies in MLP aren't human looking.
<Wrek> 05but msot bronies are not furries
<pot80> prince dari some furries arent interessted in porn at all they just like the anthro art style :P
<Canadian_Brony> IIRC, Silverscreen is a furry
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: thats not really a furry...thats beastiality
<Ryunosuke> hold on
<Saturn> 08,01i used to be a furry
<pot80> oh hell messaging froze again
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Canadian_Brony: He is.
<Saturn> 08,01my character was a comet moth
<Meanwhile> cowvarkian: What's the difference.
<Metronome> THen aRrrow to the knee?
<RosePetal> Every Fandom has this.
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> ^
<Rocknrollpony-> Irc op I know is a furry
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: ask a furry
<infernap> a furry is someone who enjoys the idea of the personification of animals, so i guess bein ga brony comes under that
<Saturn> 08,01i just liked RPing on MUCKs
<Pinkies4thWall> what about the otakus?
<prince-dari> pot80: Furries not being interested in porn is an oxymoron by my definition
<Eli> be a furry, be a brony. who cares? do what you like. live your life like YOU want not the others.
<Ryunosuke> http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o206/Chiese/1138673128104-1.jpg --- which are you?
<scout19_tf2> Saturn: good thing u changed
<Dark_Horst> prince-dari: you realise that porn is everywhere? the definition of furries only goes as far as fans of the concept of animals with humanoid traits. that's everything from lion king over werewolves to mickey mouse
<Saturn> 08,01i have no interest in animal porn
<ScootaChicken> 'There's a lot of people that can't take criticism very well'.
<ScootaChicken> inb4 emangamer
<VenHur> Okay, So I had a Gardevoir and a Lopunny on my Diamond Version team...
<Meanwhile> cowvarkian: I don't want to get too near one of those, that's hazardous to health.
<ASoftFluffyThing|AFK> Wut?
<Saturn> 08,01scout19_tf2: well, i changed because the furry community became shit
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: then fucking use google
<xles> Dark_Horst: Not even humanoid, only human. Speech alone is enough to qualify as anthropomorphic.
<Saturn> 08,01believe it or not, the furry community in the early 2000s when i joined it was much like the brony community now
<Meanwhile> cowvarkian: I 'aint googling nothing with the word furry in it. that's hazardous as well.
<LadyCanary> I know a brony who is also a furry Wrek. Really nice fellow.
<ScootaChicken> Which OC is BaconMane talking about?
<scout19_tf2> Saturn: it was aleays shit
<Saturn> 08,01it was a lot less creepy
<VenHur> ...And yes, both of them are female, thanks you very much.
<ScootaChicken> Oh wait, the one that isn't MoonDasher.
<CCCP> i honestly dont get one thing though... how are dragons concidered furries?
<ScootaChicken> DOHOHOHOHOHO.
<Dark_Horst> xles: that'S why i took lion king as an example
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01LC used to have an alicorn OC.
<Saturn> 08,01scout19_tf2: no it wasn't
<cowvarkian> CCCP: no, scalies
<Polydunami> That speaks only GOOD things to come for the Brony community, Saturn :|
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> LC?
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> OH.
<Rocknrollpony-> No they are called reptiles
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Nvm.
<prince-dari> I don't like furries because to me that's just going around telling people your sexual preferences.
<Polydunami> And yeah, that's totally not sarcasm :P
<Saturn> 08,01Polydunami: i know... i already see the shit setting in
<Ryunosuke> Lord Celestia
<Saturn> 08,01it's how communities go
<prince-dari> I don't want to know
<CCCP> cowvarkian but then why do many furries like dragons?
<Dark_Horst> prince-dari: you may not wanna hear it, but furries are very similar to us
<scout19_tf2> Saturn: SURE6_9
<prince-dari> What you do in your own time is fine
<prince-dari> But don't tell me about it
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: people say that about bronies too
<[Alpha]> :D
<Canadian_Brony> ^^
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh boy
<prince-dari> Not bronies, 'cloppers'
<Metronome> Saturn Are u foreshadowing brony will become lie the furry?
<Saturn> 08,01the furry fandom is not all about sex
<prince-dari> Would be the same as furries.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Agreed prince-dari.
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, for a lot of them it's not about sex at all
<Pinkies4thWall> ^satur
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> My think can't brain today.
<Dark_Horst> prince-dari: also furry doesnt ahve to do anything with sexual preference. now you're assuming stuf
<Lyra`> im not a clopper, but i liek to sleep around
<Meanwhile> Sumerpan message of the day. http://i.imgur.com/mOldy.jpg
<prince-dari> Dark_Horst: By your definition
<[Alpha]> wierd but amusin :P
<Polydunami> Lylat Wars
<ScootaChicken> Saturn: Then you realise that there's bare porn videos on the internet of people wanking in fursuits and stuff.
<prince-dari> By mine is does, explicitly.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hey. My old meme.
<Dark_Horst> prince-dari: so cloppers are disqualified from being bronies?
<RosePetal> I used to be in the Total Drama fandom but I left it because I could not stand the people flame warring each other over shipping because the now bad writing in the shows.
<ScootaChicken> And you understand exactly why people have that perception.
<CCCP> mfw about 45% of the fandom are cloppers
<VenHur> I'm not a clopper, I'm double dog promised i'm not.
<Rocknrollpony-> Yeah I have seen some good picture that depict the Main 6 as humans.
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: no
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: so by your definition, i was never a furry
<VenHur> And THAT'S not a lie!
<CCCP> its not bad though
<Saturn> 08,01but i claim that i was
<Canadian_Brony> No comment.
<prince-dari> Dark_Horst: Didn't say that, but I don't like people who go around calling themselves 'cloppers'
<Saturn> 08,01but not by your definition
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CCCP: Source?
<prince-dari> Saturn: Yep
<Dark_Horst> cowvarkian: tell him that
<Pinkies4thWall> Wait, can the people talking see this chat?
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: no
<prince-dari> Dark_Horst: Because what you're actually doing there is going around telling people about your sexual preferences
<NewSuperBronyU|AFK> 11,02dat dari
<scout19_tf2> brb bathroom
<prince-dari> Which is just no on.
<infernap> The furry fandom is a subculture interested in fictional anthropomorphic animal characters with human personalities and characteristics.
<Pinkies4thWall> MOO
<prince-dari> That's some weird shit
<Canadian_Brony> Pinkies4thWall nope
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> dat SB :3
<prince-dari> Keep it to yourself
<Dark_Horst> cowvarkian: why do you no me then?
<prince-dari> not*
<infernap> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom
<Saturn> 08,01infernap: exactly
<RosePetal> Well, Mlp universes can be whatever they want. They can be out of control.
<VenHur> Just to be on a fair note here, as much as I loves the Total Drama series, it's NOT a game show, but rather a parody.
<Pinkies4thWall> Dat AFK NewSuperBronyU|AFK
<Saturn> 08,01it has nothign to do with sexual preferences
<NewSuperBronyU|AFK> 11,02AJIsAwesome|MK7 :3
<Saturn> 08,01it's part of it for some people, just like in this fandom
<NewSuperBronyU|AFK> 11,02Dat meh o.o
<ASoftFluffyThing> Wait...what's going on?
<RosePetal> That's a theory.
<Meanwhile> I'm gonna follow you because http://i.imgur.com/mOldy.jpg
<Polydunami> I guess you wouldn't call Lylat Wars a furry game because it's not pornographic :P
<Lil_B> I still remember the drive to GalaCon... with the 2 Girls on the Backseat Cloppoing... well, just saying "ClopClopClop" over and over again
<CCCP> Nittany_Discord well i did an anonomous pole once about 100 answerd and almost half said yes. but agian its not very accurate.
<Saturn> 08,01but to tar them all with the same brush is just naive and silly
<Pinkies4thWall> dem dats
<CrimsonPhoenix> and if regular users had that kind of discussion they would get warned by the mods
<Lyra`> das NewSuperBronyU|AFK
<prince-dari> Meanwhile: AHAHAHAHAHA
<NewSuperBronyU|AFK> 11,02Lyra`: O.O
<Rocknrollpony-> Hah
<Canadian_Brony> ASoftFluffyThing we're discussing fandoms.
<Dark_Horst> sorry dariy, but now you're being biased
<RosePetal> I know some people love HTF but they hate the gore. They perfer love stories. That's there opinon then.
<prince-dari> Saturn: Well it's not
<prince-dari> You think the word means something different to me.
<xles> prince-dari: If it makes you feel any better to know, the majority of furries are just as disgusted by the literal wankers in the community as you are.
<infernap> i dont enjoy it as much as MLP, but i do follow a certain furry web comic
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> CCCP: Then again, that's only a 100 people.
<prince-dari> There is nothing about maturity in it.
<[Alpha]> I still want a mlp plushie
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can't even hear myself here.
<CrimsonPhoenix> prince-dari, Saturn cut it out or move it in PM
<ASoftFluffyThing> Canadian_Brony: Oh.
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: yes, and your definition is not the definition of people who would identify themselves as furries
<Saturn> 08,01so there's a disparity there than can be misleading
<Polydunami> xles, you forget that dari has his own definition of furries
<pot80> prince dari its not a definate statement as to what furries are, I don't mind the furries who like the masturbating but there are people I know who call themselves furries who just draw stuff like this http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/214/572/Human-Ammy-okami-amaterasu-21993758-700-625.png
<CrimsonPhoenix> I've been told that subject is very sensitive and should not be discuss in here
<Meanwhile> Hey, you don't get to choose what everyone else defines you as.
<Saturn> 08,01as i said, by your definition, i was never a furry
<[Alpha]> well to urban dictioonary
<Metronome> Testing Link, www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MgWtfBBq&feature=related
<Saturn> 08,01that doesn't mean i was never a furry
<Lil_B> yeah, the Furry Community (the way I expirienced it) is just like the Brony Community in many many ways
<RosePetal> Everyones out of character. Because of theories and people's opinon. They can do whatever they want I guess.
<Ryunosuke> to me, liking anything anthromorphic considers you to be a furry by definition, be it anime, stories or anything. That being said, just like ANYTHING THING ELSE, there is always R34
<pot80> sorry took a while to get the image
<Saturn> 08,01it means that only by your definition i wasn't
<CCCP> AJIsAwesome|MK7 i know i was just bored and had nothing to do and i recently saw the EQD what kind of brony are you and 25% there said they clop
<Dark_Horst> prince-dari: you definition is biased. notice the irony of that and tonights interview's topic
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Scoots, remind me to speak up in future interviews.
<prince-dari> >definition
<prince-dari> >biased
<prince-dari> Bullshit
<prince-dari> What is a biased definition
<Dark_Horst> that's what you keep telling us
<prince-dari> It's not based on opinion
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Metronome: No video links during stream, please.
<Ryunosuke> if you like SPC, you are a furry
<prince-dari> That's jsut what the word means IMO
<NewSuperBronyU|AFK> 11,02sex is bad cause my mommy say dont cause it bad an also i had to clean my rom dat day but got in mor trubl so no comp :(
<Brad[Laptop]> Definition isn't opinion.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, prince-dari could you please move this in PM?
<CCCP> whats SPC?
<RosePetal> What is your opinon on cyber bullying?
<Thulu-tan> I think this chat needs more RAVING FURIOUS SEX
<scout19_tf2> yay moms goin out ;)ima throw a brony party
<prince-dari> And since it's a made up word, you can't tell me what the definition is explicitly.
<Ryunosuke> Samurai Pizza Cats
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I have to get ready for my pep rally, I might come by later becasue my game doesn't start until 11am. Later everyone!
<Eli> i should finish my oc... it's lying around for ages now
<infernap> Quick question, what do you call a furyr interested in the "sexual" side of being a furry, we have "cloppers" what do they ahve?
<ScootaChicken> CrimsonPhoenix: The drama is glorious, shh.
*ASoftFluffyThing doesn't know what's going on besides the chat discussing fandoms
<CCCP> bye Kawaii_icybeauti
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: but yours is. you're not basing it on the fact of what peopel who identify as furries are
<prince-dari> There is no 'right' definition.
<Chrysalis> just because SB, wanna run that by with more vowels
<Metronome> That's not a video link D:<
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Bye, Kawaii_icybeauti. :)
<Polydunami> All words are made up, dari
<Chrysalis> and more constanants(*sp)
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: also, you just literally contradicted yourself
<CrimsonPhoenix> ScootaChicken, as if they'll listen to me
<Lil_B> Eli feed it before it starves
<Saturn> 08,01you said it's not opinion
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03As of now, we all have OC's
<Dark_Horst> he doesnt even notice
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03;_;
<Meanwhile> What are they even talking about anymore?
<Kurra> @_@
<CrimsonPhoenix> Scoot-Scootaloo, I dont
<Saturn> 08,01then you said it's your definition "IMO"
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Scoot-Scootaloo: I don't. :S
<Eli> Lil_B: it's probably dead then
<Saturn> 08,01which means "in my opinion"
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn prince-dari could you please change the topic here? I'm getting a bit uncomfortable about this, and I know I'm not alone on that.
<Chrysalis> Scoot-Scootaloo how so?
<Lil_B> Eli noooooo
<[Alpha]> The urban dictionary has too many definitions for furry :(
<NewSuperBronyU|AFK> 11,02Chrysalis: Cnt by nymr :(
*Kurra hoofsies Saturn :) cx
<Brad[Laptop]> [Alpha] lol
<prince-dari> Canadian_Brony: I'll change the topic when we've finished talking
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: i'm not sure you're using logic correctly
<weeping_pegasi82> I just saw a my little pony commercial that was advertising the princess cadance doll
<Polydunami> This stream was surprisingly well timed :D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03The people on the stream, I mean :P
<CCCP> hi weeping_pegasi82
<GilDash> Did I remember my fire-retardant clothes today?
<Rocknrollpony-> Funny story, this guy named BigEd came onto a MLP stream and lined the comments with the word faggot. He made one mistake by pasting his link for his livestream. Man we went over there and all used the name as BigEdisabitch and put Bronies forever bitches.
<RosePetal> The Kingdom Hearts fandom is even more crazy. The majority is basically fangirls and yaoi. The females get constanly killed because they get in the way of their fanon which I find really stupid.
<prince-dari> Saturn: You're not understanding what I said there though
<Eli> Lil_B: ah no. it can't die. it's an alicorn :P JK
<weeping_pegasi82> hey CCCP
<Lil_B> and not to mention the houndrets and thousands of people who are both Bronys and Furries xD
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: i completely understand
<[Alpha]> Ok...ay
<prince-dari> The definition I hold isn't based upon opinion.
<Saturn> 08,01and you're wrong
<Dark_Horst> prince-dari: then decide on what you want to say
<prince-dari> But it is my opinion that that is the definition.
<Lil_B> Eli mine is a Humble Earth Pony... WITH CHEMISTRY!
<CrimsonPhoenix> so it's ok for mods to discuss sensitive subject like that but for regular users that's bannable
<prince-dari> Two completely different things.
<CrimsonPhoenix> good to know
<RosePetal> lol remember when people thought Princess Cadence was annouced and people hated her.
<Metronome> Kingsom Hearts Is BEST GAME EVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: yes, and that definition does not match the definition of people who actually are furries
<Brad[Laptop]> prince-dari are you saying that your opinion had been guided by observation?
<CCCP> but really all fandoms are really weird, so i think our fandom isn't that bad compaird to some others.
<Saturn> 08,01so yes, you can continue using that definition
<Canadian_Brony> I'm going to go shower and get myself some food, and when I come back, hope the topic has changed. K?
<scout19_tf2> well i gots to go c u guys at movie nite :$
<Saturn> 08,01but that defiinition is wrong
<Eli> Lil_B: keep mine pegasus. because the ability to fly is one of the things i wish most
<VenHur> I don't have an OC. [Dun dun duuuuuuun!]
<Dark_Horst> prince-dari: therefore, it's your definition. also faulty
<pot80> In all honesty I got nothing against furries, cloppers or whatever
<RosePetal> I love Kingdom Hearts but their fandom is crazy.
<prince-dari> There is no correct definition.
<ScootaChicken> CrimsonPhoenix: The heirachy, dealwithit.jpg
<Brad[Laptop]> CCCP yep. all fandoms are weird, contain weird people, and do weird things :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That blog is still dead.
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: but there are degrees of correctness
<Metronome> ^^^ Huh?
<prince-dari> According to what?
<Rocknrollpony-> me neither
<[Alpha]> This convo
<CrimsonPhoenix> ScootaChicken, it's hypocritically stupid
<VenHur> I love Kingdom Hearts, but what RosePetal said is true.
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> ^
<Saturn> 08,01i would argue that the more correct definition is the defition used by the people who subscribe to that definition
<Brad[Laptop]> lol "no absolutes" argument.
<Metronome> ^^?//
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And that OC is almost gone.
<Lil_B> Eli I wanted mine to do magic, but I said forget that! I do Chemistry and so does my OC!
<Saturn> 08,01i.e. the ones who identify as it
<Saturn> 08,01as they are defining what it is to be a furry
<Saturn> 08,01in their action
<Brad[Laptop]> I think this has turned into semantics.
<cowvarkian> so, this is fun
<prince-dari> I'd say it's more majority.
<CCCP> i dont like the home stuck fandom
<cowvarkian> Brad[Laptop]: no shit
<cowvarkian> really
<RosePetal> Back on topic again.
<Rocknrollpony-> I hate kingdom hearts, for the sole reason that micky mouse is in it.
<LadyCanary> ....
<cowvarkian> RosePetal: there was a topic?
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: well, we'll agree to disagree on that then
<prince-dari> And you can't tell me you know exactly how many people use each definition
<CCCP> but i like hommestuck :/
<LadyCanary> Seriously, Rocknrollpony- ?
<Polydunami> That's quite picky, Rocknrollpony-
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: The Brony Show to Interview Brony Documentary Head Laurent Today!
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> CCCP: I've never read homestuck. What's wrong eith the fandom?
<prince-dari> Ok
<RosePetal> I thought there was never mind.
<VenHur> But Mickey Mouse is fucking awesome.
<LadyCanary> Thats...pretty stupid.
<Eli> Lil_B: i love chemestry, but my school right now doesn't offer anything like it
<[Alpha]> I love kingdom hearts :)
<Ryunosuke> prince-dari, so if 90% of the world says the world is flat, does that make it true?
<MadSurge> Lil_B: besides, magic is almost a scientific element in Equestria
<AdamTheDuck> Good morning everyone. :)
<prince-dari> Ryunosuke: That's different
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Hi, AdamTheDuck. :)
<Ryunosuke> no, not really
<x1es> Is it?
<Dark_Horst> prince-dari: however you call it you have there, it's incorrect. being a furry does not define sexual preference or preferred categories of porn
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: not really
<prince-dari> That would make it generally accepted
<CCCP> AJIsAwesome|MK7 its a fandom... its just very odd in some areas :s
<prince-dari> Not correct.
<RosePetal> So alicorns are considered immortal? Does this mean that Cadence is Celestia's niece or something?
<prince-dari> There is a difference.
<Rocknrollpony-> Well micky mouse in a game is great, just don't like cross overs.
<VenHur> He's one of the main highlighted characters in the animation studio department, Disney's mascot, and an importaint piece in animation.
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: it's just that then confusion arises if i say "i was a furry" and you interpret that under your definition to mean "i used to like porn of animals"
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: you're still wrong
<Lil_B> Eli that sucks :( I wanna do ccomputer science, but there is nothing nearby ether :(
<Eli> nothing against alicorn OCs. but they just look silly most of the time
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> RosePetal: It hasn't been confirmed.
<VenHur> Because we all know that it all started with him.
<Saturn> 08,01which is not correct
<Saturn> 08,01that's all i'm saying
<Ryunosuke> and so you are making a general accepted definition as opposed to what is actually true? :)
<prince-dari> Well, I disagree
<GilDash> Isn't the sexual "furry" preference defined as a "yiffer"?
<gentelmen-geeky-scho> im back
<CCCP> i really just dislike things like the .MOVs and stuff like that
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: so you're saying i *did* like animal porn?
<Lil_B> MadSurge yeah, but Still xD
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'll just go back on Background Pony....much more entertaining
<Ryunosuke> what gildash said
<GilDash> Speaking on general internet knowledge here...
<Metronome> BTW,Are We even Discussing the Talk Show?6_9
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> RosePetal: In my opinion, not all alicorns are immortal. Only just Luna and Celestia so far.
<Meanwhile> I wouldn't put it past you Saturn.
<[Alpha]> The Mod sessions :P
<Dark_Horst> GilDash: it is
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: i mean, it's fine that i wasn't truly a furry in your eyes
<Saturn> 08,01that's up to you
<RaveBrony> What did i miss? Had to pick up my younger bro
<prince-dari> Saturn
<Lil_B> GilDash no
<prince-dari> With this
<prince-dari> [22:30] <Dark_Horst> prince-dari: however you call it you have there, it's incorrect. being a furry does not define sexual preference or preferred categories of porn
<Metronome> *Podcast
<shana> Eli: hm what kind of school level are you in?
<VenHur> Rocknrollpony: I loved the SNES game, Mickey Mousecapede, Mickey Mania, The Illusion games, etc.
<Ryunosuke> just as there are cloppers in the Brony community, there are Yiffers in the Furry community
<Meanwhile> You missed RAVING FURIOUS SEX.
<Lil_B> I have in 3 years never heard the Term "Yiffers"
<RosePetal> Yiffers? 0_0
<cowvarkian> I just enjoy the porn...
<Ryunosuke> yiffers
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: and i'd agree with him on that
<[Alpha]> XD
<Brad[Laptop]> some people like to sexualize everything. its going to exist everywhere.
<prince-dari> And no, I wouldn't consider you a furry.
<VenHur> Rocknrollpony: I hates Magical Mirror and Disney Party...because it's another Mario Party wannabee.
<Saturn> 08,01fair enough, that's your prerogative
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: it's not widespread. becasue many people confuse definitions. like we're seeing right now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yiffers are the porn lovers of the furry community.
<Eli> shana: uh... how do you say that in english. no idea. one higher than high school
<Polydunami> I never even HEARD the term "yiffing" until I watched the CSI episode xD
<[Alpha]> This is weird :S
<Eli> shana: it's just a sucky school
<UBBR> 0,5Oh i get it. Surries, Yiffers. Bronies.... clopp...pers....
<pot80> Technically a word to discribe a groub of people with similar interessts has to have a definate definition in order for the group to be accurately connected and represented by that interesst, in that way furries are an interessting community as the have a vague connection to each other but have created a group based upon it :P
<Saturn> 08,01just so long as if someone says they were a furry, you need to understand that they're saying they were a furry under their own definition
<GilDash> And with that I'm going back to lurking and watching this chat unfold. XD
<Rocknrollpony-> I licked that micky mouse game on the gamecube or n64.
<gentelmen-geeky-scho> after walking my dogs i come back to takling of furrys and yiff 0-0
<shana> Eli: kantonsschule?
<Polydunami> And I already knew about furries :D
<cowvarkian> well, by porn I mean drawn shit
<Saturn> 08,01as they might not know yours
<CCCP> Nittany_Discord but lets be honest most furries are yiffers or at lease it comes off as that
<Rocknrollpony-> *Liked
<Wrek> 05yiffers = cloppers
<Eli> shana: you're swiss√®√®√®
<RosePetal> But, the crazy fangirls love the villians. Go on badguyconfessions blog on tumblr and see all the things the people typed in. Some are just weird.
<Wrek> 05furries = bronies
<Wrek> 05we have more in common than you think
<CCCP> :o
<Eli> shana: ???
<Wrek> 05stay open minded mah bronies
<shana> Eli: yep :)
<cowvarkian> Wrek: hmm
<Metronome> ^D:<
<VenHur> Rocknrollpony: Mickey Speedway USA? Oh that was good...
<[Alpha]> Wrek: makes sense
<Bronysith> Wrek: people dont know how to be openminded sometimes man
<Dark_Horst> and yes, that's right
<cowvarkian> Wrek: I'm fine with this
<prince-dari> Saturn: There is a lot of stigma associated with the word 'furry'
<Chrysalis> RosePetal that works the other way around you know
<ScootaChicken> But guys, I thought all bronies were cloppers?
<RosePetal> True.
<Dark_Horst> the furry community is VERY similar to the brony community
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst yeah, but even within the Furry Fandom I've never heard the term yiffers
<CrimsonPhoenix> so it's really ok for mods to discuss that kind of topic but not for us users?
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: true
<cowvarkian> ScootaChicken: ikr
<shana> Eli: I noticed youre hostname a while ago, you're the first swiss I noticed :D
<Polydunami> Stigmas are bullshit.
<Chrysalis> prince-dari theres alot of stigma attatched to EVERY label
<Chrysalis> good or bad
<Eli> shana: duuuude! first swiss brony i meet here. it's a WMS wirtschafts mittel schule
<prince-dari> So I'd rather just use the definition of it I have so as not to associate people who don't deserve that stigma with it.
<x1es> Wrek: You're telling me that the largest community of cartoon fans in the world has something in common with bronies? Inconceivable!
<Tiberium126> Moring all
<VenHur> But again, it rips off another thing from Mario, and that's Mario Kart...
<Rocknrollpony-> Played that, it was indeed awesome
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Can't believe how terrible my volume is.
<[Alpha]> Prince-dari now I understand why you want me to bully ScootaChicken
<gentelmen-geeky-scho> AdamTheDuck: ello

<RosePetal> I kinda like how the background ponies get all kinds of names that the communtiy puts together.
*AdamTheDuck noms gentelmen-geeky-scho
<RosePetal> Genius.
<CCCP> i also really don't like some of the "memes"
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: i did. i once read the word appeared witht he description "the nosie you get when you rub two foxes together"
<LadyCanary> FINALLY.
<Keir> Yiffers..never head that one before
<CCCP> this fandom makes
<gentelmen-geeky-scho> AdamTheDuck: no dont nom me
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: aye, fair enough. just so long as you realise that if someone does call themself a furry, it's not automatically by your definition
<prince-dari> Yeah, fair enough
<AdamTheDuck> gentelmen-geeky-scho, what argument have I woken up to on BronyState? :$
<cowvarkian> CCCP: sumerpan is the hero bronystate needs
<Rocknrollpony-> OMG 24 minutes left till the movie
<Metronome> Wht?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03OH SHI-
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> AdamTheDuck: It's a long story.
<Eli> shana: it's in the welschland though... completely in french. and really sucky
<Meanwhile> Rocknrollpony: That's an hour and 24 minutes.
<LadyCanary> .... Scoot-Scootaloo Oh my god HE'S STILL AT IT
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: a raw text form of the fox counterpart to a dog's bark. it's a weird noise

<Rex_Ivan> EQD bullies EVERYONE
<UBBR> 0,5WERE ALL HUMANS ;___;
<Rocknrollpony-> It says 24 mins for me
<Polydunami> UBER
<cowvarkian> UBBR: what's your point
<gentelmen-geeky-scho> AdamTheDuck: idk i just came back from walking my dogs and then i see somthing about yiff furrys and porn
<VenHur> ...So...uh...who liked wrestling...?
<Alchemist> CCCP: what memes do this fandom make?
<cowvarkian> gentelmen-geeky-scho: good for you
<gentelmen-geeky-scho> VenHur: brohuf
<Dark_Horst> VenHur: it was not very effective
<gentelmen-geeky-scho> cowvarkian: yup
<ScootaChicken> d
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> prince-dari: WUT :D
<[Alpha]> XD
<Lil_B> I think "Yiffers" is more a word used by people who don't know much about Furries, most just say "yiffing" or something like this, but nobody gets called a "Yiffer" , but yet again, I don't really communicate with Furries, There is only a lot of Stuff I read and witness
<shana> Eli: hmm wms doesn't sound like they offer much science stuff.. I went to a "kantonsschule" which had some pretty decent science program
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: hah
<RosePetal> Didn't the characters on the show bullied other characters? Remember in Putting your Hoof down when ponies were being mean to Fluttershy? And what about Ponyville Confidential? I'm surprised there are no fix fics on that episode but yet Mare Do Well and Canterlot Wedding have all kinds of fix fics because none of the characters apologized.
<UBBR> 0,5No moar text walls about it
<VenHur> Yeah, wrestling sucked these days, I have watched WWE, it sucked, don't know about WCW or TNA though...
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: the problem is that even the community itself cant really agree on the terms
<VenHur> Sorry.
<Polydunami> GILDA
<CCCP> Alchemist like... erm "20% cooler" "The fun has been doubled" they just seem forced they dont really make sense and arn't tjhat clever

<AJIsAwesome|MK7> HavokOC: Baconmane.
<HavokOC> Ooooooh

<HavokOC> >.<
<DashWithRainbows> [wall of text of whatever UBBR is talking about]
<Rocknrollpony-> Gilda is worst friend
<DashWithRainbows> :3
<Applejack2012> I wonder if the bully episode will be about The Mane Six being bullied as school fillies
<Alchemist> CCCP: I thought they are just terms thrown around. I didnt realize those were memes.
<gentelmen-geeky-scho> VenHur: did you here that da wwe is taking down all the atitude era stuf down on youtube
<ScootaChicken> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3HErOOaAfs&feature=g-all-f I know about no video links and whatever, so sorry in advance, but this is brilliant background music for this stream.

<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: there is a site though dedicated to that word. so it must find some acceptance inside the community

<LadyCanary> XD
<Eli> shana: do you have the full funny SG dialect?
<Polydunami> Right, I've got some things to do; I'll be back later tonight.
<infernap> the movie night's still happening though right?

<Chrysalis> with actual cannons
<GilDash> Saturn: Tsk, you should've known better then to open your mouth. :p

<Eli> shana: hop St. galle, f√ºre mit em balle! I always hear that when they are playing in Aarau :)
<shana> Eli: I'm pretty sure every place has its own dialect :) maybe every town (though they probably start to disappear a bit)
<Alchemist> pony_2780: most people do every single night. Except for amputees.
<Rex_Ivan> Saturn ... I thought the crabs came back to the gulf.
<Eli> shana: yep they do
<Chrysalis> Eli wtf, how do you accidentally type ¬º
<Yahooz> BronyCon was eh. BronyPalooza was probably one of the greatest moments of the summer
<Saturn> 08,01Rex_Ivan: sssh! if you say that the joke doesn't work!
<ScootaChicken> I shared a bed with another brony once.
<RaveBrony> So... is Raving Furious Sex, the sex bronystate needs? O.o
<pony_2780> Alchemist: i thought i was special!
<Yahooz> see because thats where all the other fun bronies are at
<ScootaChicken> It was amazingly awkward.
<Saturn> 08,01ScootaChicken: did sexytimes happen?
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> Yahooz: Where is BronyPalooza?
<Eli> shana: ?
<turtlegod98> Anyone here draw any tribal stuff?
<ScootaChicken> Saturn: It was Emty, ask him instead.

<Yahooz> AJIsAwesome|MK7: the concert after day 1 of bronycon
<Saturn> 08,01does that help?

<GamerGodJones> Is this anti bullying thing still going on?
<Saturn> 08,01but he left because he couldn't make it to the con
<VenHur> I loved how there's a console named after you, Saturn.
<VenHur> But it sucked...
<pony_2780> √∏√¶√•
<UBBR> 0,5I have friends!
<ScootaChicken> He had to go to Sri Wanker instead.
<cowvarkian> UBBR: Im sure

<Saturn> 08,01Sega's marketing of it sucked
<turtlegod98> i have no tea and biscuits...;_;
<Eli> shana: woops. it was Chrysalis
<Lil_B> ok... I'll have to have my ear out in the Movie for the Ziegeunerweisen and the Sabre Dance

<Saturn> 08,01cowvarkian: that's what i said...
<RaveBrony> Hahaha
<turtlegod98> *high five saturn*
<VenHur> If only Sonic X-Treme was released, it would of been good, but to me...it's not enough to make the Saturn the best...
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> I liked the Sega Saturn. Too bad that most of the GOOD games were Japan only.
<Lil_B> brb... srs bsns
<Eli> Chrysalis: maybe because i have a german keyboard
<cowvarkian> Saturn: No, I'm agreeing with you, and saying that since it was sega, that implies that their marketing must be bad
<gentelmen-geeky-scho> im a potato
*Alchemist is off to kill some aliens
<Saturn> 08,01ah, okay
<VenHur> I mean, compare Sonic X-Treme with Crash Bandicoot 1 and Mario 64...

<StinkomanFan> Aw, :c
<Cades> haha

<Michael> sonicdude558: idk but it's amazing

<GamerGodJones> Hey what is this video called?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> somone vandalized some mural paiting for mlp
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and wrote something about glue factory
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> i had to laugh...
<Nyst> Just look at how clever some of those sorting mechanisms out. Not even the build, but just how clever the idea is.
<pony_2780> wut u men Eli ?
<RaveBrony> Im going to guess contraption hax
<cowvarkian> <.< inb4 this guy makes robots for skynet
<Eli> pony_2780: forget it. did you think of a name yet?
<Nyst> I don't know the name, but try searching lego rube goldberg machine on youtube.
<Lil_B> when I was really really young I used to dream about endless marble mazes
<pony_2780> no, Eli im lazy
<infernap> imagine the maker putting this on his resume
<cowvarkian> inanely complex contraptions for legos
<alexxm> imagine having to take this thing apart
<Dark_Horst> WE HAVE CIRCULATION!
<Lyra`> is this even legos at this point? or is it just robotics?
<RaveBrony> So badass
<Nyst> That crane arm is amazing! It looks so good!
<Lyra`> :o!
<pony_2780> and im sitting here drinking julebrus
<Michael> endless
<cowvarkian> alexxm: apart? bah, ridiculous
<Dark_Horst> Lyra`: lego has a big production wing in robotics
<cowvarkian> and then it all starts over
<turtlegod98> Holy jesus...I mean, Holt celestia...
<sonicdude558> Is this some kind of cruel joke?
<Dark_Horst> Lyra`: they call it mindstorms, i think
<MadSurge> Aaaaaand it loops back :$
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: totes mcgotes
<RaveBrony> Inb4 the video loops?
<turtlegod98> *holy
<VenHur> I think the person who made all of this is...
<RaveBrony> Nope :D
<AJIsAwesome|MK7> This is amazing, Saturn. :O
<MadSurge> 600 HOURS

<AJIsAwesome|MK7> VenHur: Red Herring!
<Rex_Ivan> Pony_2780 I'm doing Steel Reserve beer. We can make a game of it if you like ... but I may rather not
<alexxm> how many days is 600 hours
<naturesfury> wish they added how much that thing cost
<Nyst> It doesn't look like any of the parts get clogged either. That means the speed the balls move at is consistent too. Amazing.
<turtlegod98> y am i so bad at typing?

<DuckmanCuack> 6_9
<cowvarkian> ASoftFluffyThing: I don't think it is either
<pony_9797> daty yay
<RAWRity> RaveBrony: I don't think they really have a single "best" friend. Remember, the opening says "Don't you know you're all my very best friends?"

<RAWRity> I lik RD well enough, but she most often has the least interesting episodes
<Freefall29> what time again is the lottery tonight?

<superretroworld> how did this movie get a 90% on RT?
<twilight_sprinkle> ^no
<Reikim> So. What did we just finish watching?
<cachi01> deserves*
*Kinixys hugs Lil_B!
<Cypresswolf> There's hardly anyone on the island anyway, they'll never know
<RaveBrony> And yet....SHE gets ALL of the merch....
<USSR> YAY
*Bronysith lickels Reikim

<Freefall29> ponies. the best time f the day
<Jesse_> Yay ponies!
<ASoftFluffyThing> TIME FER PONYS
<RAWRity> I can stand arrogance just fine. It's more that her episodes far too often dwells on her being selfish and arrogant, when there's LOTS more you can do with conflicts involving her
<EspyLacopa> Yay, ponies
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Reshelving day is best day.
<DuckmanCuack> Ponis :yay:
<Saturn> 08,01ponies! \o/

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Dat fire ruby
<Reikim> 'Ello, Regs.
<Jesse_> *Forever alone*
<Reikim> Sith, you did that already.
<RAWRity> That's why I like "Fall Weather Friends" it's not focused on her being blindly arrogant. It's her and AJ both letting their competetiveness get the best of them.
<OohShiny> the only spike episode, if I remember so
<Ponies47> Dem regulars
<ASoftFluffyThing> Why didn't I download dance.love earlier?
<sonicdude558> cue intro
<Nyst> Her horn pierced that book, that's hard.
<twilight_sprinkle> thats what i do!
<Pale_Horse> Everypony knows that's how gems work, right? :P
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Happy Birthday, Spike. :)
<Cypresswolf> :3 My birthday present to myself next year will be a giant chocolate cake ^_^

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> cowvarkian: :D
<RaveBrony> lolwut
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: ^
<DocSane> OohShiny: Owl's Well was totally a Spike episode
<Pale_Horse> I'm fairly certain that dragons can choose to eat meat in a pinch, too. :P
<Cypresswolf> From Cheesecake Factory - the 7 layer one - quite pricey at $100, but who could resist that?
