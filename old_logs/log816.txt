<ShineBrony> all my movies are the same, comically stupid, insanely lame. after a few minutes you become annoyed, i keep rob schnieder employed!!
<palin> What's the limit for pony emoticons in a single post?
<brony655321> I've always wondered, are most of these original songs or covers?
<cowvarkian> palin: 12
<palin> I'm tempted to do :D x90
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> those mario blocks lol
<Lil_B> Phase4 I do think there are ways to Store the electricity with some Elements, but these who would be able to do it are ether way too rare or way too toxic
<DaringDerpy> found it
<Java> Brb preparing dinner.
<DaringDerpy> thx Sumica :)
<Phase4> 00,02Java, i will, the charge to motion efficency of that car is like 80%
<cowvarkian> palin: do it then
<Sumica> 00,10do so and you do it once
<palin> cowvarkian hush child
<Tremil> A lot can be covers. but ive seen some that were original compositions
<BroGavin> 5:00 pm is best time of day
<palin> why?
<Cosmo> Corn on the cob. Corn on the kabob!
<Tremil> Corn Candance....rofl
<Bradbotpony> I just noticed something! :O
<Phase4> 00,02average combustion egine is 15% or less
<BroGavin> get off work
<brony655321> Yeah I've seen some originals, but the majority don't usually say.
<BroGavin> watch ponies
<palin> lucky
<rd1985> how much longer for the new ep
<Bradbotpony> 6 hrs
<Cosmo> 6.5 hours.
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, solid state batterys won't be able to store enough charge for quite a while
<Tremil> Titles are usually a spinoff of the original

<Tom> Episode 8 of season 3 "Apple Family Reunion" airs in 0 days, 6 hours, 23 minutes, 32 seconds (Dec 22 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<palin> too long is the correct answer
<rd1985> darn it
<palin> yeah, basically, too long
<Sumica> 00,10is this how time normaly passes?
<Sumica> 00,10slowly and all in order
<Bradbotpony> yes
<rd1985> i guess
<Baconator> Staying up was a horrible decicion
<palin> failquote
<Tremil> Been waiting too long for best ponies ep. lol
<ShineBrony> Alright bros, im out for tonight.
<RustyToaster> It's gonna be one CHAOTIC family renion... *troll face*
<ShineBrony> peace all
<brony655321> Oh. Well "Avast [Ponie]'s Ass" took me a while to learn that was a cover so...
<palin> Doctor Who would be ashamed of you, Sumica
<Bradbotpony> night
<Phase4> Lil_B, theres a variation on li-ions that uses atmospheric oxygen, stores energy something like 10 times denser, that would be suitable for use in cars
<Ralathon> Depends on your relative velocity and proximity to massive objects.
<Java> Phase4: Actually it's pretty energy efficient: 244 mi (393 km) per charge.
<Sumica> 00,10ask me if I care
<Tremil> of Avast Your Ass by Kitsune^2
<BroGavin> lol fat trixie
<zeKieranator> Do you care?
<naturesfury> is this a remix of renard?
<cowvarkian> Sumica: I'm guessing no
<palin> Sumica Clearly you care enough to tell people you don't care, thus creating a paradox lie

<palin> isn't it funny when people do that?
<Tremil> Apple Fritter better be in the reunion ep
<Phase4> Java, and charge time :P thats the other issue, electrical grid isnt capable of suplying cars with charge
<palin> if you REALLY didn't care, you wouldn't even care enough to say you don't care
<brony655321> Yeah I learned that about 2 months after hearing Wooden Toaster's.
<rd1985> surbrisly im wide awake
<Sumica> 00,10So place your bets, how long will palin last
<Phase4> >surbrisly

<rd1985> palin
<RustyToaster> fluttershy is haunting me right now
<palin> Awwww, Sumica thinks he is cool because he feels important on the internet :)
<Bradbotpony> xD
<BroGavin> same her rd1985
<palin> that's cute, it really is kid
<cowvarkian> Sumica: I'm betting a few more hours
<BroGavin> here
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: 68 minutes
<palin> say something ELSE to compensate for your pimple penis :)
<palin> whoops, stopped caring
<palin> sorry
<zeKieranator> Sumica: 43 seconds.
<cowvarkian> 10 seconds
<Phase4> Java, the next stage is electrical propulsion, but batterys may not be the answer for storage
<rd1985> im scared of fluttershy now
<Sumica> 00,10oh good it self termniated
<Tremil> MCR?
<Tremil> lol
<BroGavin> wait i want to see palin and sumica fight!
<BroGavin> FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT
<Pinkies4thWall> too late
<Phase4> Java, when we have electrical light aircraft, thats when things get really cool
<Bradbotpony> :D
<RustyToaster> where'd all the silly people go?
<rd1985> here
<Java> Phase4: I really need to leave for a while, preparing dinner. But I want to say that we will oneday find a way to store electricity more effieciently.
<cowvarkian> RustyToaster: they got purged
<Bradbotpony> they died in the great war
<brony655321> Place your bets ladies and gentlemen. He's got the eye of a winner, and a hot hand.
<Phase4> Java, definantly :)
<Ralathon> Electrical aircraft are going to be hard, heating up air like we do with jet engines is hard to do with electric energy. Better use hydrogen instead.
<cowvarkian> ikr
<texasboykc09> Sumica: can we have a break from pmv
<rd1985> ikr
<Phase4> Ralathon, you wouldnt build an electrical turbine XD
<Phase4> thats just pointless
<RustyToaster> poneis anthology II???
<brony655321> ...Is this MCR?
<cowvarkian> sure
<Baconator> I don't understand what's happening in chat at all...
<Tremil> yup

<Petrified_Discord> Fuck u cars, I'm in a mech
<rd1985> ya
<Sharkun0> A FLYING mech
<Wynn> lol
<Sumica> 00,10Fae Valentine
<Bradbotpony> :D
<Cosmo> Faye.
<pony_6216> Faye
<pony_3999> the new episode is about applejack right?
<pony_6216> LOL NERDRAGE!
<Tremil> yes
<Petrified_Discord> No relation to Mai Valentine
<pony_3999> ok
<Cosmo> :3
<Sharkun0> Apple Bloom
<wanderingbishop> She's a lot older than she looks, just be aware
<pony_6216> WHAT!
<Ralathon> Im not an aeronautics expert, but I had enough fluid physics to know that thing cannot possibly stay airborne at those low speeds.
<RustyToaster> Yes, I believe it's called Apple Family Masacre
<OtakuTom> Yea, we love to correct spelling, especially when it comes to character names XD
<brony655321> You know, Twilight wouldn't fit Fae. She'd be more Rarity.
<wanderingbishop> It's called anti-gravity :P
<Ryunosuke> oh look, its zangetsu :)
<Lil_B> ohey now we're watching Ninja Freejazz
<rd1985> wow
<pony_3999> its science, they dont gotta explain sh.... oh wait.
<Phase4> cool guys don't look at explosions
<Sumica> 00,10grand theft bebop
<Lil_B> the Movie!
<Ralathon> Anti gravity my arse, if they had anti gravity they could build a time machine. They wouldnt waste it on fliers when you could just kill their grand parents.
<cowvarkian> Phase4: they turn around and walk away
<brony655321> But he was staring at it just now.
<Ryunosuke> uhh
<Bradbotpony> I'ma boat now
<Sumica> 00,10space boat
<Ryunosuke> wouldnt the water you know, ripped off those fins? :)
<Buytoast> anti gravity means time travel?
<Sharkun0> Heh, CBC
<Bradbotpony> nope.avi
<pony_3999> CBC.
<Phase4> interesting idea, using water to slow
<Buytoast> what in the ehll are you talking about?
<RustyToaster> James Earl Jones
<Phase4> i should try that in ksp
<rd1985> dang
<cowvarkian> hey darth vader
<Sumica> 00,10oh hi the major
<Shizuka> 13section nine is on it
<brony655321> yeah...
<Ryunosuke> ohai Shizuka
<cowvarkian> hey shizu
<texasboykc09> hello Shizuka
<pony_3999> are zambies gonna pop up?
<Ralathon> Yea it does Buytoast. Time delay is a function of gravitational field. Negative mass leads to a path in space that goes back in time.
<Sumica> 00,10Shizuka heard the voice of the major and came to see waht was up
<Bradbotpony> yes!
<Lil_B> Still playing that Phase4 ?
<cowvarkian> in this segment, the buddha is stopping a horrific explosion
<RustyToaster> the animes! they're are melting together
<Ryunosuke> sumica, are you saying what I think you are? :)
<Phase4> Lil_B, why wouldnt i be?
<Buytoast> so hovercrafts mean time travel
<Buytoast> how interesting
<Buytoast> why don't you go make it happen then
<cowvarkian> make it so
<Ralathon> Hovercrafts work on air pressure, not anti gravity.
<Sumica> 00,10I think so Ryunosuke, but where will we find a duck and a hose at this hour.
<Buytoast> how do you know?
<Lil_B> Phase4 because... I have no reasoning
<pony_3999> future aircrafts might
<Ryunosuke> Sumica: oh... my
<Petrified_Discord> They run on magicanium
<rd1985> go away girl
<brony655321> I was gonna say, hovercrafts work on air...
<Sharkun0> Do they eat anything OTHER than noodles?
<Ralathon> Because I build a hovercraft from a old vacuum cleaner once.
<Bradbotpony> gurl you crazy
<Tremil> she is derpy
<Sumica> 00,10I want self heaing instant noodles like that
<pony_3999> please someone tell me, who is weird girl?
<Sumica> 00,10heating*

<Phase4> pony_3999, ed i think
<pony_3999> oh ok

<Ralathon> Good to see that safety regulations while building interplanetary wormholes aren't enforced.
<DaringDerpy> the moon was overrated anyway
<Cosmo> lymphocyte = white blood cell
<DaringDerpy> no one needs tides
<brony655321> That's actually explained in episode 14, Ralathon.
<cowvarkian> zoom and enhance
<Ralathon> The moon stabilizes the earth's axis of rotation DaringDerpy, without it the poles would sometimes point directly to the sun. Mars does that as well.

<Sumica> 00,10never had issues with adblock+ either
<Sumica> 00,10just so long as I remember to close my browser every few days so it can update
<the_real_pony_1604> the thing is, I don't like nor want firefox
<the_real_pony_1604> I hate installing redundant things
<Java> Use Opera
<Tremil> i use chrome and ive never had a problem

<Vordox> Twixie...
<Vordox> Makes sense
<brony655321> @Saturn: Nice. I'd actually like to learn the violin too, but sadly not one teacher in my area. Apparently the music teacher I was taught by was also taught by a Princeton Professor. I'm only majoring in math because it comes easy to me so I'd always have a job. But my love is in music.
<KrazyNoobs> 9gag face

<KrazyNoobs> I don't wanna watch them though
<the_real_pony_1604> it most likely DHX or Hasbro, it is someone at the hub leaking it. because when they get put into the hubs play servers DHX and Hasbro have lost control of it
<Sumica> 00,10nice anti tank rifle
<RawketLawnchair> Gotta love them Anti-Tank weapons.

<KrazyNoobs> YUP, SEASON 3 EPISODE 9 HAS ALSO BEEN LEAKED... why!?
<Vordox> Sumica: IN DUE TIME
<KrazyNoobs> I have to now stay off /mlp/ for a week
<Vordox> Monsuier
<RawketLawnchair> I reckoon that a brone works at iTunes and leaks the episodes.
<LaserPon3> This 3D animation is really good
<Dark_Horst> becasue people are impatient idiots
<FreelancerRaiko> damn straight
<Uboa-San> And im patient.
<FreelancerRaiko> but seriously why the hell am i stil getting ads
<Java> RawketLawnchair: Or he's pony hater and leak it to ruin our fun
<KrazyNoobs> Someone should tell The Hub and DHX Media and Hasbro about this
<wipergone2> FreelancerRaiko: get adblock?
<Dark_Horst> probably becasue you did something wrong
<FreelancerRaiko> already have ad block dude
<FreelancerRaiko> it's apparently notworking
<Sumica> 00,10FreelancerRaiko it's realy off unless you some how have an out of dat version it should be blocking them all on firefox
<RawketLawnchair> Java: We're gettin' early pone. S'good enough for me.
<wipergone2> FreelancerRaiko: reinstall it
<Dark_Horst> 1) install adblock+ 2) restart browser
<Sumica> 00,10did you get adblock or adblock+
<Phase4> KrazyNoobs, wait, 9 leaked too?
<Dark_Horst> that's all it takes
<FreelancerRaiko> fine i'll go reinstall the damn thing
<Phase4> KrazyNoobs, was that also itunes?
<Java> I think Hasbro need to take care of this. Their profit related with audience numbers.
<Java> Less audience = less ad money
<Stonegaze> Hey everypony, what are we watching?
<Phase4> hasbro needs to yell at itunes
<Phase4> very loudly
<brony655321> iTunes has had it for a while.
<zeKieranator> @Stonegaze: Appleseed.
<brony655321> Granted only today.
<Java> and then he ded
<the_real_pony_1604> Hasbro doesn't care, it is all about selling toys. they don't care if the episodes get leaked. it is the same reason why they don't shut places down like bronystate
<KrazyNoobs> NO!!! MY DAD JUST LEFT MY MOM. D:
<Uboa-San> Looks like the Apocalypse didnt happen.
<KrazyNoobs> Make me feel good, BronyState.
<Stonegaze> Mayans, I am dissappoint.
<brony655321> Well how could you. No such thing as bad publicity.
<LunarSolace> It only got leaked a few hours before the actual air time.
<Invoker> hurr durr childs dont watch this bitch

<lazyname> hi all
<SuperBrony64> 11,02wipergone2 :D
<MadSurge> How are you AdamTheDuck? :)
<KrazyNoobs> DoctoDoctorWho They started arguing about a decision my father made in work (I won't go into detail), and then my dad got really mad, so he left and said that he'll be back for his clothes in the morning. I have three younger siblings, 7 year old sister, and 13 and 15 year old brothers. I'm 17.
<Java> Naming the place Tartarus simply inviting problems
<aniderp|bestcakeever> SuperBrony64: im gonna draw you another picture i think!
<FreelancerRaiko> but their anger can also form righteous fury
<haseo348> this reminds me of cubex
<FreelancerRaiko> when tempered ina burning will
<haseo348> for some reason
<Dark_Horst> KrazyNoobs: that seems like a feeble reason to split
<Bipolarized> Damn these clones really have a superiority complex.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Utopia is impossible, humans are warlike and greedy.
<LunarSolace> Hmmm how convinient
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: Bronystate is an utopia
<Sumica> 00,10hence the bioroides DoctoDoctorWho
<FreelancerRaiko> DoctorWho: But they're also righteous and humane
<KrazyNoobs> Dark_Horst I know, it is pretty stupid. They have been together for 18 years, and WERE great parents
<Java> KrazyNoobs: Be strong, you're the older brother. You need to be their guidance.
<wipergone2> SuperBrony64: 3

<haseo348> OBJECTION!
<LunarSolace> What is with these Greek names
<FreelancerRaiko> it's the choice to do right that matters
<DitzyDerpy15> YIPPIE-TI-YAY = Next Episode's line i thnk...

<Java> KrazyNoobs: Get a Skype
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i can draw.. but 3DS prevents me from doing my best sometims..
<DoctoDoctorWho> Sumica: So a society of artificial life forms is perfect? I can get an ant farm and call it a utopia, cool.
<DarkDeity5> KrazyNoobs: I can't say I know what you're going through, but I feel for you just the same
<KrazyNoobs> Java: I never said I would not be supportive, I will be really supportive to them.
<Sumica> 00,10no DoctoDoctorWho they help balence things

<Demicorn> Wow, what a nice music!
<TheBucket> WAT IS SONG GAIS
<Skull> Tom what site did you get that from?
<TropicalWings> Y2K
<Laina> Marttivainaa, try see the episodes, the serie is good :3
<aniderp|bestcakeever> we watched an episode of dr who here
<Lasharus> Why on earth are you annoyed about this, VenHur?
<Mistral> You should try it, Marttivaniaa :3
<ponyslender> 2nd doctor was pretty good
<TheBucket> IT SOUNDS LIKE RONALD JENKEES I SWEAR
<Tango123> So did the world end yet?
<Marttivainaa> I guess i could give it a try
<Zonalar> 99 BUCKETS OF OAT ON THE WALL~
<moonslicer> did you know the time machiene used to be a car?
<something> yes
<Mistral> Who was the 1st doctor?
<Mr> It's a shame Doctor Who blew up after David Tennant :/
<aniderp|bestcakeever> nope
<RadShiro> WHAT SEASON SHOULD I START WITH IN DOCTOR WHO?
<awildderpyappears> anyone else excited for the christmas special?
<something> just yesteday
<Suzano> F yeah! Rarity! MA BEST PONEH
<Kurra> The 21st should become a rave day
<awildderpyappears> wooo
<Serenity> Tango123: Sorry, you missed it
<Mistral> It's the 22nd ~
<Laina> This commercial is following me
<Marttivainaa> The world did end, this is the backup save of it.
<Sir_Shadow> WHAT DID I MISS
<Skull> The first one. Dumbass.
<Mistral> Applejack is best pony
<Skunktrain> @Mistral William Hartnell
<VenHur> Lasharus: Cause I got trolled. By Maiyans...Rage, much?
<ponyslender> um start where ever you would like
<ponymon> Goooood morning! We're still here! Suck it, Mayans!
<Skull> Alway go from first to last.
<Celebi> RARUTY YOU ARE JUST FANTASTIC ! ;)
<Skull> Cunt.
<TheBucket> WHAT IS THE SONG?
<Mistral> Mayans! Guys, it's Mayans!
<moonslicer> the time machiene was a car in doctor who
<Kneesocks> take one down pass it around
<Serenity> VenHur: Waiiit? You actually BELEIVED them?
<ouo> i need a pone
<TheDerpamon> Start with season 1 and end with the season we're up to now. Durr.
<Sir_Shadow> Did I miss the derpleader
<Mistral> I've seen it spelled Maiyan, Meyan, Myan, etc etc it's MAYAN
<kamenpony> is it a coincidence Oppan Gangnam Style hit a billion on the 21st?
<ponyslender> the mayans never thought the world was going to end. that was us being wierd
<sampsoninc916> i didn't think the world was going to end because no one knows when God will end the world and take us Christians back to heaven
<VenHur> Serenity: Pffffy, NAH!
<Mr> RadShiro, I personally would start with the Christopher Eccleston series and go from there
<Adjective_Brony> What is the song?
<Tango123> I have a horse. Does that count?
<Sir_Shadow> Super maiyan 2
<TheBucket> 21st just went SUPER MAIYANS
<Tyranoman> You know the Mayans never actually predicted the 21st to be the end of the world right? They predicted it too be the start of a new era.
<FreNeS1> eyyup
<RadShiro> hmmmmm. i'll give it a looksie Mr
<Applelovefan> po
<Kneesocks> lol
<Mistral> (Christopher Eccleston was best doctor. Just thought I'd throw that in. Again.)
<Invoker> Welp its a new Era now
<Mr> hope you enjoy :D
<Jake> 555 people wooh!
<Kraft58> Mayans also never counted the leap year
<BackgroundPone> it was the ancient mayan ALIENS
<TheDerpamon> I personally think it's not just the David Tennant episodes that are amazing.
<TheBucket> Wait, no one knew that?
<LunarSolace> hmmm Someone really like Rarity
<Serenity> Mistral: I guess I can say I agree
<kamenpony> the Era of the Golden AGE
<Mistral> Yay :D
<TropicalWings> Dec 21 was more like the final date of their calendar
<TheDerpamon> All three actors are great.
<ACS13123> I have no clue what's going on
<ACS13123> So you know
<ACS13123> Hai and all
<Cirno> we need more rarity fans anyways
<VenHur> Oh, I know! I know!
<Tyranoman> It's the era of ponies!
<Serenity> I'm a Rarity fan.
<Niggabrony> what song is this?
<ponyslender> mayans predicted that gangnam style would be at a billion views
<Mistral> I like Rarity, but my favourite is Applejack
<spypengen> http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/347/7/c/coolyes_animated_by_miketheuser-d4ix32f.gif
<moonslicer> i can wait im just gonna play animal jam for 1 hour and 15 minutes
<sampsoninc916> oh, of course I love rarity.
<Marttivainaa> The mayans knew someone would believe it and they made a prank :3
<Cacodaemon> the way to get into the cristmas spirit http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe-8ykTUT8 lol
<Skunktrain> I was never a huge Tennant fan. I didn't dislike him but I like Matt Smith more.
<Serenity> Who doesnt like the British ways?
<Invoker> Its the era when Humans transform into Ponies :D
<Invoker> jk <3
<Skull> Me.

<pony_756ffd> wat
<Skull> Britian sucks.

<Applelovefan> yeah
<Mr> Invoker, I actually wouldn't complain.
<Demicorn> Global ponyfication.
<RadShiro> The Mayans didnt get to finish their calender because the Spanish Inquisition showed up
<Demicorn> :)
<Mistral> ... WELL THANKS A LOT.
*Serenity stabs Skull
<sampsoninc916> i'm american
<ponyslender> but the mayans never thought about it like the end of the world
<pony_5491> Hate not
<Duto> Name of this PMV ?
<Celebi> I like rarity because lets smile me ^^ sorry for my baf english
<BackgroundPone> This is the start of an era of enlightenment, friendship and peace!
<Skull> lol
<TropicalWings> think of it as our standard calendar right now, in a few centuries, some future scientists will find on of our calendars and will think the world will end at Dec 31
<Suzano> then i would be proud to say "Im hung like a horse" :D
<RadShiro> NO ONES EXPECTS THEM
