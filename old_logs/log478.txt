<RAWRity> CK|Ded: well, the bit he said about that not being the only that would surprise him, plus those flashback snippets we got, seems to imply that something to do with that power has changed.

<GarrettBrony> dat jazz
<RAWRity> CK|Ded: I imagine that there's something...special about Him taht allows that. I suspect the spirits are fucking with things.
<Darkts3> Nothing Wrong here
<Reikim> Dat jazz. O, hi Bronystate.
<drfsupercenter> 03HML
<GarrettBrony> dat ragtime
<drfsupercenter> 03you might laugh at this
<Darkts3> Jazz is awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03I found this page showing how to safely disassemble the Xbox 360 HD-DVD drive, right
<drfsupercenter> 03"Starting out we have an unsuspecting HD DVD drive. It sits calmly as we eye it up."
<necroshadow123> sagas: yeas show me your moves lol
<Darkts3> Invisible Pistols =/
<GarrettBrony> is Ninjazz here?
<Reikim> Evening, all.
<drfsupercenter> 03that wording is awesome :P
<Ingwaz> so, i'm curious, how exactly does one become a bender? born with it? learned ability? natural ability?
<FlareChaser> WindWhistler: http://flarechaser.deviantart.com/#/d524cn1 is this an opinion?
<Nyria> I love their invisable guns
<twilight_sprinkle> jazz hands
<Reikim> Good evening, everyone.
<MahBoi777> GarrettBrony: nah, he left
<Darkts3> Ingwaz: born with it
<CCCP> ...........
<Pajaro> holding arms like guns
<CK|Ded> RAWRity: I hope so. I really hope there's a good reason. If it turns out to be commonplace nowadays, then it really breaks things in the universe.
<GarrettBrony> dang
<sagas> right now
<Reikim> She's like Toph!
<necroshadow123> sagas: if only captain flacon was in movies
<GarrettBrony> I guess she put her Foot down. I am right
*CCCP walks away :3
<CK|Ded> Dat tunnel
<RAWRity> CK|Ded: well, the fact that Korra is surprised about it, and her line about the full moon, suggests it isn't commonplace
<Ingwaz> GarrettBrony: that was bad...

<MahBoi777> Sylandest: great!
<RAWRity> What I'M worried about is YOung Justice.
<CK|Ded> RAWRity: Presumably, but I guess we'll find out. In any case, it's a bit vexing. Something feels wrong about the way this new series has been going, and I can't put my finger on what. But something's off.
<Reikim> inb4 it's a....dammit.
<necroshadow123> sagas: lol yay will ferral
<Woodenfan|Ponymon> I want Fluttershy, Rarity and Sweetie Belle.
<WindWhistler> FlareChaser: Yes. Onions.
<FlareChaser> its a trap!
<FlareChaser> :3
<HatsuneMikuFan> When is Legend of Korra on TV?
<Reikim> Those mecha...
<sagas> necroshadow123: That was fucking gold! :D :D
<Ingwaz> so, with bending, is there some sort of factor that generally determines whether one will be born a bender? family lineage? is it completely random?

<twilight_sprinkle> noob guard
<CK|Ded> Suddenly, metalbending became totally useless. >_>
<Sylandest> sneee
<twilight_sprinkle> seriously wtf, how many times will they reuse that
<Ingwaz> DOGPILE!!!
<Pajaro> lol
<Irish_Pony> Sylandest: Well not in the way you think....
<Kyiko> SNEE
<twilight_sprinkle> people shoudve goten used to that
<RAWRity> CK|Ded: well, they WERE designed to beat Metalbenders
<Ingwaz> have to refresh...chat borked...AGAIN
<GarrettBrony> I am a metalbender. Please insert gerder
<Sylandest> Irish_Pony: I merely meant everypony having a fun time on the stream. What were you thinking? :P
<FlareChaser> you're your
<FlareChaser> lol
<CK|Ded> RAWRity: But is the entire factory built and lined with this "pure" platinum? >_>
<Darkts3> Korra's Season finale needs to be streamed =/
<twilight_sprinkle> everyone seems to forget firebenders can breath fire
<ingwaz> and i'm back
<GarrettBrony> dis stream just got some streampunk
<Reikim> Why can't platinum be metal-bent?
<HatsuneMikuFan> Welcome back ingwaz
<WindWhistler> can't metal bend a metal? What?
<CK|Ded> RAWRity: And if so, HOW did they find this?
<GarrettBrony> Toph
<XAX_> Hmm parents won't be home for 5 to 6 hours. I KNOW! I'll unplug the PC and take it into the lounge and plug it into the tv lol
<Reikim> ...Equalist?
<twilight_sprinkle> WindWhistler: they bend the impurities, not metal itself
<GarrettBrony> or the Wrath of KHAN
<Gunthler> IT'S A TRAP! http://derpy.me/nHtPk
<Gamer_Luna> Free Art Request OPEN
<Nyria> That pun if horrible~
<Darkts3> Wind is OP
<ingwaz> assume baldy is an air bender?
<Pajaro> robots/
<Alister> Gamer_Luna: me first !
<FlareChaser> Sumica: DISTRACTION
<CK|Ded> Reikim: The supposed logic is that metalbending relies on bending metallic impurities. Of course that annoys me since metal is still a type of earth and should therefore be bendable anyways, but....
<Reikim> inb4 epic...oh wait.
<ingwaz> shouldnt he be able to tear some crap up if hes an air bender
<ingwaz> ?
<MahBoi777> Big Daddies oh noes

<GarrettBrony> Assassins do Creep up on people Pajaro
<drfsupercenter> 03hahaha
<drfsupercenter> 03I tried to install Windows 8 in a VM
<HyperMetalLugia> and
<Pajaro> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03instant crash
<HyperMetalLugia> shovelware for Wii
<drfsupercenter> 03after 2 seconds
<HyperMetalLugia> well durr
<CK|Ded> Reikim: Well as I was about to say, Lightning is somehow a deviation of Fire, so yeah. Logic fails constantly.
<Gamer_Luna> Sure, Alister ! :) Send me a link of what you want :)
<HyperMetalLugia> you're doing it wrong.
<drfsupercenter> 03" Your PC need sto restart, please hold down the power button"
<HyperMetalLugia> you gotta use Virtualbox
<ingwaz> nice hit
<PinkieSpice> why did it stop?
<sagas> SOOO much steam punk...
<Reikim> Dat airbend
<HyperMetalLugia> (Just joking)
<CK|Ded> All the same....I don't seem to recall platinum being "super pure" OR super durable
<WindWhistler> wow, only seven episodes in and already it's epic
<Darkts3> i got a cigarrette add
<RaveBrony> EPIC
<ingwaz> nice use of tech
<HatsuneMikuFan> KO
<HyperMetalLugia> worked fine for me the first time I did it though so O.o
<Darkts3> lololol
<Cypresswolf> I haven't seen much of new Avatar, not sure where this ep fits in
<CK|Ded> In fact I'm pretty sure it's NOT.
<drfsupercenter> 03the release preview?
<drfsupercenter> 03the one that just came out yesterday?
<hen3ry> any metal can be "pure"
<ingwaz> wait...why am i rooting for the bad guys? these benders arent very awesome...
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: it's the halfway point for the first season.
<Nyria> >fire benders, >bend lightning~ Is it me or am I missing out on something?~
<FlareChaser> hen3ry: DEATH METAL!
<sagas> Am I the only one who dislikes 3D overlaying 2D cartoons?
<hen3ry> although many of them are useless in their pure form
<Reikim> CK|Ded: So then this show said "FUCK LOGIC, we'll have people manipulate the elements."
<Nyria> I know they can, but why don't they do that?~
<WindWhistler> sagas: I don't.
<Pajaro> dragon shouts>bending
<HatsuneMikuFan> sagas: I hate 3D overall
<ingwaz> Nyria: lightning is a lot of heat, so maybe thats the logic
<GarrettBrony> Lightning benders have to withstand power levels up to 1.21 jiggawatt
<Reikim> Pajaro: Blaspemous.
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/RW1vf.png
<CK|Ded> Reikim: Still doesn't explain platinum's ascension to a "super-metal". :P
<Darkts3> =/
<FlareChaser> ...
<Nyria> ingwaz: I know that~ I mean why don't they do that here?~!
<owlicious> GarrettBrony: wait, that's just enough power for a flux capacitor
<Nyria> here?~*
<RAWRity> Bolin, never change.
<ingwaz> Nyria: oh, thought you were asking why they could
<Reikim> CK|Ded: They probably borrowed it from alchemy.
<Herp_Derp> you gonna die
<WindWhistler> STREET RAT
<sagas> WindWhistler: It just seems lazy and out of place for the artists to use it
<Nyria> ingwaz: I know I made it sound like that~ And that ! was not meant to be there~
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dat sweet humanized Rarity
<GarrettBrony> Platinum's is a super rare and hard to find element
<Darkts3> lol
<Reikim> So anyway, someone complained about lightning-benders? I don't think they actually conduct it.
<ingwaz> shes gon get shocked
<HyperMetalLugia> oh
<Herp_Derp> she gon die
<xXxSc00t_C0mm4nd0xXx> 00,03Night y'all!
<CK|Ded> Rare? Yes. Valuable? Sure. But not because it's super durable.
<FlareChaser> how bout no.
<WindWhistler> sagas: I don't like how it looks weird...
<Reikim> inb4 denied.
<Darkts3> xXxSc00t_C0mm4nd0xXx: lol now?

<Reikim> xXxSc00t_C0mm4nd0xXx: Night

*Irish_Pony huggles Gamer_Luna back <3

<CK|Ded> Sky bison aren't extinct after all.
<ingwaz> you're not a failure. you make a good example as to what a failure is
<MuffinWarrior> CupcakeWarrior: DAI!

<Ascendant> For clarification, I would never touch the staff list unless given approval
<Ascendant> and I know that Kyu didn't approve of it
<Pajaro> nice hotrod
*RaveBrony hugs CupcakeWarrior

<Reikim> Steampunk swag.
<Yukari> alright fine
<Ascendant> Feather
<Darkts3> ahh Gotham City
<CK|Ded> ingwaz: Roku was just the one that came before Aang, and the one we got used to in the prior series. So presumably Aang will show up a lot in this one.
<ingwaz> CK|Ded: ...so...guess they just decided to pick a japanese word and make it the name...just happened to pick the word for six
<Ascendant> type /cs halfop #Silverwings
<Yukari> leave me alone.
<otakon> inb4 it gets wrecked

<Nyria> Is that the british flag on the hood?~
<GarrettBrony> Radios

<Feather> 10o.o
<MahBoi777> panda: GilDash left a few hours ago and Om left about an hour ago
<Ascendant> >_>
<otakon> goddamn Chi Blockers
<Ascendant> before*
<ingwaz> CK|Ded: i thought aang was supposed to be the last avatar they'd had for a long time?
<Cypresswolf> :O 1st can is empty...darnit, brb
<Pajaro> da popo
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I'm sorry Ascendant, I just assumed you had un-set it
<Feather> 10but I also auto op'd when I joined before
<cachi01> CK|Ded: THERE WAS A SERIES BEFORE AANGS STORY?
<drfsupercenter> 03so I take back what I said about you doing so
<RAWRity> I LOVE the music in this scene
<HyperMetalLugia> because it's drama.. :s
<Reikim> Really, this is the best steampunk I have ever seen ever.
<GarrettBrony> na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Avatar!
<otakon> ingwaz: no, he was the last AIRBENDER, not the last Avatar
<PinkieSpice> ;A;
<Yukari> that was half if myreason to be pissed
<PinkieSpice> so awesome
<Ascendant> Feather, you don't have auto-op set on
<cachi01> CAR CHASE CITY
<Yukari> I'm sell passed
<Yukari> pissed
<CK|Ded> ingwaz: He was frozen in ice for a hundred years, so yeah, that's sort of a long time.
<Yukari> still
<RAWRity> ingwaz: he was the last airbender, because he narrowly avoided mass genocide
<Feather> 10I always did
<Pajaro> THUNDA
<GarrettBrony> Dat Blues Brothers chase
<Nyria> Damn the soundtrack is amazing~
<Darkts3> huh... he can bend lightning
<MahBoi777> zap zap
<ingwaz> otakon: i meant the last one they'd had in awhile, like it had been some time before they had an avatar
<twilight_sprinkle> WAIT WAIT WAIT
<otakon> ingwaz: also, Airbenders are coming back into the world slowly but surely
<Ascendant> then type /ns set autoop on
<PinkieSpice> the old avatar wouldn't evn have cars, let alone car chases
<Yukari> f*ing autocorrect
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant, why don't we t...you beat me to it
<twilight_sprinkle> did he just bend lightning
<Feather> 10then when drf told me I had been removed, it quit doing so
<otakon> ingwaz: yeah
<WindWhistler> inb4 they get arrested for destruction of property
<Darkts3> good for him
<Ascendant> well, drf made a mistake
<GarrettBrony> good speed avatar go
<MahBoi777> nice
<RAWRity> Darkts3: that was established way back, when we saw him working in the power plant.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, I thought she removed it
<CK|Ded> WHEN THERE'S LIGHTNING~
<Reikim> I can't even describe how awesome this is.
<Pajaro> owned
<Alister> Airvending would be useful right now ....
<GarrettBrony> I can
<CK|Ded> YOU KNOW IT ALWAYS BRINGS ME DOOOOWN~
<Ascendant> how about
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently we were just talking about it and never actually did
<ingwaz> otakon: so...how was the avatar before aang in the show if it had been some time since he died, presumably
<Ascendant> we don't talk about this here
<Darkts3> darn
<CK|Ded> Bolin: still useless
<MahBoi777> don taze me bro!
<Pajaro> swag
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: eeyup he did, that means he's either pretty damn skilled or Lightning bending is very common place now
<Reikim> Dat scarf of asskicking.
<GarrettBrony> Telsa would be a lightning bender
<Darkts3> Lightning is pretty op
<otakon> ingwaz: spiritually and flashbacks
<HatsuneMikuFan> Reikim: :D
<Everlasting_Joy> GarrettBrony: :)
<Darkts3> since it can kill ppl faster
<Gunthler> This fight seems pretty cliche... >_>
<ingwaz> otakon: i see
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: looks like its just common, cuz now random people can steal bending, bend metal
<Darkts3> Gunthler: =/ how?
<Gamer_Luna> :'(
<CK|Ded> ingwaz: The series makes a point of saying that each new avatar receives spiritual guidance from the previous avatar to help them master the elements and keep the balance.
<WindWhistler> I KNEW IT
<Gunthler> Darkts3: because the good guys won. they always do. :|
<GarrettBrony> Go Team Rocket
<otakon> ah, Team Avatar
<MahBoi777> it's on now
<lol> how do you do that thing where you specifically highlight some one and send them a message, but every one can see it?
<Nyria> That was a huge hint to him being evil~
<otakon> now they need a smart aleck
<twilight_sprinkle> get in trouble with the police- VICTORY FACE
<GarrettBrony> Equalists = Communists
<CK|Ded> Tarlok is WORST FRICKING PONY.
<MahBoi777> lol
<GarrettBrony> dat totalitarian
<RAWRity> CK|Ded: FUCKING RIGHT HE IS.
<Cypresswolf> You know, the more I drink, the more I think I have a tolerance to certain liqours, I can handle at least 9 shots straight whiskey 70 proof 40% alcohol volume, but 3 beers at 4.2% alc content gets me buzzed O_o
<ingwaz> this show gives me conflicting feelings. it could probably have a really good story if it took it very seriously. but they try to make it too comedic and play it off it seems
<otakon> I do not like Tarlok
<otakon> OH YOU FOOLS
<Everlasting_Joy> Totalitarianism, yay!
<CK|Ded> Also, Council is worst council
<cachi01> lol: write the first letters of someones name then hit tab
<Gamer_Luna> panda,did you get the link for the 3rd pony in The Element Ponies?
<otakon> dat smirk
<otakon> he's EVIL!
<Reikim> Is he a chancellor? Cuz if he is then he's evil.
<MahBoi777> only gonna create more hate
<Sylandest> this guy is a dick
<FlareChaser> lol that was funny
<WindWhistler> otakon: YOU BEAT ME TOO IT
<FlareChaser> lol
<WindWhistler> TO*
<Nyria> Look at that car hod~
<otakon> WindWhistler: lol
<twilight_sprinkle> suuuure everyone is stupid except the good guys, isnt that original
<Darkts3> donuts =/
<Nyria> hood*
<RAWRity> The way the council always conforms to Tarlok makes me think he's got some kind of control over them.
<CK|Ded> You think he's a dick NOW?
<FlareChaser> lol is not the best name to choose
<FlareChaser> lol
<CK|Ded> lol just wait.
<otakon> lol
<panda> Gamer_Luna: no I did not :(
<Darkts3> oh noes
<WindWhistler> Twilight_Sparkle^_^: That's always the case...
<Reikim> RAWRity: Blackmail?
<Yukari> fine
<otakon> and then jealously
<Pajaro> burn dat rubber
<ingwaz> Cypresswolf: isnt one beer equal to a shot alcohol wise?
<Yukari> now leave me alone
*lol lol
<otakon> hiya RAWRity
<WindWhistler> Whoops wrong pinger
<MahBoi777> RAWRity: hint hint
<RAWRity> Reikim: I'm thinking something more...devious
<CK|Ded> You'll see why RAWRity and I consider him to to be WORST PONY.
<Ascendant> As you wish, milady
<WindWhistler> twilight_sprinkle: That's ALWAYS the case in any show.
<otakon> ITS A TRAP!
<Reikim> RAWRity: Ooh, this sounds good. Care to explain?
<otakon> Wait......it's not equalists
<Chimera> o-o
<RAWRity> Reikim: you'll see.
<Chimera> huh.
<Yukari> fabulous sarcasm
<twilight_sprinkle> WindWhistler: which is why its extremely unoriginal
<Biglaw> Hey RAWRity! How's it going?
<RAWRity> Biglaw: going good.
<MahBoi777> dat ain't right
<Ascendant> that wasn't even in jest lol
<Reikim> It's like he's trying to start a civil war.
<Reikim> OH WAIT
<RAWRity> Suddenly it's getting all WWII Germany in here.
<otakon> Reikim: eeyup
<Cypresswolf> ingwaz: I have no idea, first time I bought beer in a few months, I usually drink whiskey, taking a break of at least a week when the bottle runs dry
<Darkts3> dat hat swivel
<Ran> 2Sigh
<ingwaz> Reikim: you dont say
<Gamer_Luna> panda http://kinzsaw.deviantart.com/#/d526ti7

<GarrettBrony> I think we should streem toonami
<twilight_sprinkle> wtf this doesnt even make any sense
<Reikim> And nobody questions him.
<otakon> the hell?
<CK|Ded> Occupy Republic City
<ingwaz> hmm...not bad
<otakon> Reikim: enope
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: what doesn't make sense?
<cachi01> Gamer_Luna: plants looks awesome
<Reikim> You'd think you would have at least one police guy saying "Hey, maybe he's insane".
<Ran> 2Things happen sometimes
<otakon> BULLSHIT!
<Ascendant> As they do
<panda> Gamer_Luna: hey... do you think you can give me a difinitive color spectrum for each character... its hard to tell from your drawings you know?
<MahBoi777> NO
<ingwaz> stuff about to get serious
<CupcakeWarrior> OH SHIT
<otakon> okay, now you PISSED HER OFF
<Cypresswolf> Shit just got real :|
<Darkts3> Bitch Please............... IM THE AVATAR
<otakon> FUCK THAT SHIT, KICK HIS ASS!
<Gamer_Luna> panda,okay :)
<RAWRity> Reikim: seeing as police have done this shit IRL, I don't find it undbelievable.
<ingwaz> OH COME ON!
<ingwaz> this could have been awesome
<Reikim> Man, Korra is so much more hardcore than the last series.
<MahBoi777> that's bull
<RAWRity> ingwaz: just. wait.
<CK|Ded> Looks like Tarlok just narrowly avoided a ver ....rocky road there
<CK|Ded> *very
<Nyria> I agree with otakon~
<FlareChaser> RAWRity: yeah, I seen them do it before.
<Ponies47> WHOO WHOO! :P
<Darkts3> Toph!
<ingwaz> RAWRity: i've watched this show a few times now, so far, i'm not all that interested
<GarrettBrony> Toonamis Back Bitches
<MahBoi777> Reikim: I agree
<ingwaz> GarrettBrony: late to the party?
<otakon> GarrettBrony: eeyup, is it on tonight?
<Reikim> Also, this seems familiar for some reason...the dichotomy between the empowered and the unempowered.
<WindWhistler> KNUCKLEHEADS
<owlicious> you can't ignore his girth
<Darkts3> lol
<Cypresswolf> aw...Pepsi Twist was not what I expect :P I thought Pepsi created a label with ponies

<ingwaz> you know...i want to kill someone
<Darkts3> lol
<WindWhistler> EVER
<Sylandest> ever!
<Nyria> hahaha~
<ingwaz> and that was stupid
<GarrettBrony> this reminds me of ther Communist witch hunts of the 1950s
<Reikim> Tenzin is now a boss.
<Woodenfan|Ponymon> flying all de way across my screen, Sweetie Belle, Fluttershy and Rarity. I don't want them to leave, I want them to STAY STILL.
<HatsuneMikuFan> You tell him!
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<MahBoi777> way to get the last word Tenzin
*Celes_Chere lols
<Biglaw> Lol
<GarrettBrony> this reminds me of ther Communist witch hunts of the 1950s
<CK|Ded> ....and then
<otakon> GarrettBrony: well, that's kind of the idea
<CK|Ded> Eva Rule 3
<diddutz> i still miss an iroh or azula like character
<Biglaw> that, was the worst chief of police ever, of all time
<Reikim> GarrettBrony: Amen.
<twilight_sprinkle> its name is naga?
<otakon> and then she BUSTED THEM OUT
<ingwaz> i just cant take it seriously with the comedy it tries to throw in
<Pajaro> Naga!
<Darkts3> Twilight_Sprinkle: ikr?
<RAWRity> CK|Ded: rule 3 is in full effect.
<Ascendant> XD
<Ponies47> That's a big dog! :o
<otakon> diddutz: Tenzin is supposed to be the Iroh I think
<CK|Ded> ENGAGE ALL THE RULE 3
<Reikim> diddutz: Tenzin fills the "kickass uncle" roll.
<MahBoi777> time to kick ass
<RaveBrony> :D
<otakon> Ponies47: Polar Bear Dog
<Tov|SleepPowdered> My Avatar senses woke me up

<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: hm ive never heard of such a movie
<Gunthler> !muffin
<RAWRity> Shizuka: you just seem to love pink/red hair girls
<Seastallion_of_War> Redheads are HOT
<Iron_Mare> Who doesnt?
<Shizuka> 13asuka cause of her psych issues, aelita because awesome
<Reikim> Shizuka does seem to like pink hair.
<Herp_Derp> back everypony!
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: argh
<Cypresswolf|Blind> The School may cave in? ^_^ No School! No School! Lalalalala
<otakon> and then they all died
<ingwaz> official, dog is the avatar
<Ascendant> Iago is the biggest troll in all history of trolls
<Alister> FlareChaser: behold glory ! http://alisterchop.deviantart.com/art/Alister-OC-306017175
<cachi01|lag> if they have time travelled all this time how many freaking altarnate dimensions have they created?
<Reikim> Shizuka: Her psych issues are, I find, much better presented in the Rebuild.
<otakon> cachi01|lag: no idea
<FlareChaser> Alister: dats pretty coo
<Seastallion_of_War> Although those with magical purple hair because they're the moon are hotter :)
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: point is you always tell me it hsa to do with something in the show, but im oits just fanservice
<Shizuka> 13yeah but it's missing the reason for her issues in rebuild
<HyperMetalLugia> pfft
<owlicious> when you feel you're sinking fast, when you're cast adrift.
<Ascendant> http://nfs.sparknotes.com/othello/page_54.html
<Ascendant> makes me lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Not as big as a troll as exakr
<Ascendant> "put money in thy purse"
<GarrettBrony> 101 dalmations
<RaveBrony> ^
<Reikim> Shizuka: Wait until the third movie. I know I can't wait :)
<Shizuka> 13having the doll with her means it's not the kyoko-went-insane arc of the original
<cachi01|lag> 101 xana
<Shizuka> 13oh yes
<Pajaro> it's just like 2012 that fucking horrible movie
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: in THIS case it IS just fanservice as far as I can tell
<ingwaz> yay power outage at half way done transfer? just have his torso left
<RAWRity> CK|Ded: this is a show where they're trying to use CODING to simulate protein synthesis. Ultrasound not working right is the least of this show's inaccuracies.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: oh ok
<PinkieSpice> whats his name
<Shizuka> 13yep season 1
<Tov|SleepPowdered> Tokens. having more than 1 black person doesn't focus test well.
<PinkieSpice> aluric?
<Shizuka> 13forest is old style
<Simon> Does anyone remember the name of the device where they used it to jump back in time?
<Alister> FlareChaser: Now that I think about it, you put a coat on your OC so you don't have to draw a cutie mark
<Litwick> Should've stayed at Season 1.
<Reikim> Shizuka: I think Kyoko went insane in this one as well. And Asuka carries the doll as some sort of psychotic way of dealing with that.
<Seastallion_of_War> A:TLA had best fanservice
<GarrettBrony> Lyoka x Tron Fic
<FlareChaser> Alister: yeah, I still have one though
<cachi01|lag> aelita used surprise butt secks but it failed!
<Pajaro> can she fight?
<tgl1992> Hows it going, everypony! :)
<CK|Ded> RAWRity: Obviously they need to follow Hackers rules and just start calling virtualization "penetration"
<otakon> GOD WHY DO THEY HAVE FOREHEAD CANCER!?
<RaveBrony> Thank you captain obvious
<cachi01|lag> hi tgl1992!
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi tgl1992
<Cypresswolf|Blind> I find it a great strategy to keep a few dogs & cats around, if they start acting strange or disapear, pay attention, it may mean a natural disaster is about to occur
<otakon> Pajaro: um, not really
<Reikim> Why do you care?
<twilight_sprinkle> hrrr, grrrr!
<Iron_Mare> Hi Tgl1992!
<Pajaro> that's useless
<RaveBrony> otakon: Cuz drugs
<ingwaz> otakon: its rather rampant in america, didnt you know?
<GarrettBrony> otakon have you ever seen MST3K the Movie?
<panda_> CK|Ded: O_o
<Ascendant> also Kosoveon, I borrowed King Lear from my school
<RAWRity> CK|Ded: and then have Ulrich and Yumi change their names to Crash and Burn
<Kosoveon> he is indeed, and the fact that he is actually able to trick a popular general into doing a bunch of crazy sh*t is pretty impressive
<Reikim> USE CAT AGILITY
<Iron_Mare> *slowpoke*
<Chimera> Ascendant rofl
<cachi01> dun dun duuuun
<HyperMetalLugia> Hey ascendant, is there any way for xchat to tell you that a person is offline *in* PMs?
<otakon> GarrettBrony: sadly no
<CupcakeWarrior> They arent allowed at the beach because whales could get beached on their foreheads
<Little_Cloud> HI EVERYPONY!
<Shizuka> 13we've gotta cross over to the other side, just ease into death and we'll be there
<twilight_sprinkle> why did the kids cross the hole?
<cachi01> HI Little_Cloud
<Kosoveon> nice <3
<Chimera> Iago is a terrible waste of a life xD
<Pajaro> meow
<Iron_Mare> AT LEAST TEN MEATERS!?
*Seastallion_of_War http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100630114703/animebaths/images/f/fb/Katara.png is best fanservice
<CK|Ded> RAWRity: Sounds good!
<Iron_Mare> OH NO!
<panda_> Shizuka: dem emo lyrics ^^
<Kosoveon> although you'll hate edmund by the end of the play lol
<hen3ry> meters are now feet
<GarrettBrony> otakon. watch it . IT explains them having large foreheads
<ingwaz> those sex noises...
<Kosoveon> you'll see what I mean
<RAWRity> Shizuka: I forget, does death stick after the jump back in time, or not?
<Reikim> Again, dat run animation
<CK|Ded> panda_: Weren't there for that movie night I assume?
<Ascendant> I think
*Seastallion_of_War dat Katara
<HatsuneMikuFan> 10 meters? That's nothing for Master Chief
<RaveBrony> inb4 kids become pancakes
<Ascendant> I already hate him, Kosoveon
<Cypresswolf|Blind> *suddenly wants to watch Cloverfield*
<panda_> Seastallion_of_War: ?
<Shizuka> 13they never die prior to a reset button
<Little_Cloud> Is there any interesting stuff now?
<otakon> Seastallion_of_War: goddammit all I forget about that
<CupcakeWarrior> Seastallion_of_War: She nekkid
<Ascendant> he's manipulative like Iago
<Shizuka> 13they just get insanely close
<Ascendant> but he's stuck-up
<panda_> CK|Ded: I was there for the hackers movie ^^
<CK|Ded> >dodge
<Pajaro> video game logic
<CK|Ded> >lasers
<Little_Cloud> No?
<CupcakeWarrior> Shizuka: He meant IF they died
<Little_Cloud> D:
<Iron_Mare> They are all godmodders
<Derpy_Hooves> FILLIES AND GENTLECOLTS: presenting the most badass cross-over ever: http://e621.net/data/1c/69/1c69af41e2919c0a5a1979539987903d.jpg?1338692305
<twilight_sprinkle> Seastallion_of_War: http://cache.ohinternet.com/images/4/45/Dat_ass.jpg
<Shizuka> 13IF they died... probably
<otakon> Shizuka: wait, what would happen if one of them died and then they reset?
<Ascendant> and er HML?
<Shizuka> 13or it might not work
<Seastallion_of_War> panda_: Dat Katara - http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100630114703/animebaths/images/f/fb/Katara.png
<Cypresswolf|Blind> how do you misinterperet a 7 for a 6?
<HatsuneMikuFan> Still no rope burn
<superretroworld> the atmosphere looks like a platformer video game
<RAWRity> I'm just wondering.
<Shizuka> 13never happens so we don't know
<GarrettBrony> Are those kits from Metaluna. Their Foreheads are huge!
<Ascendant> dunno
<tgl1992> Whats funny, I loved watching this show but never got what the plotline was :D
<HyperMetalLugia> kay
<GarrettBrony> *kids
<HyperMetalLugia> just annoying though
<panda_> Seastallion_of_War: odly... not arrousing ^^
<RAWRity> Because if it DOESN'T stick with the Time Warp, then this whole scene with Odd is kind of worthless.
<CK|Ded> They have to rely on Yumi? They're doomed
<Chimera> Ascendant you're reading Iago?
<cachi01> kid is going to die yumi will die just when aeilita slow mo writes code lyoko
<Kosoveon> he's driven by not being able to fit in, not because he is necessarily a straight-up evil person like iago
<Kosoveon> therefore he's less interesting
<Kosoveon> IMO
<Chimera> erm
<GarrettBrony> Jeremy definatley knows the time warp
<Chimera> Othello lol
<drfsupercenter> 03Othello = Reversi :|
<ingwaz> panda_: listen to the breathing noises with your eyes closed, itll fix that problem
<Alister> Gamer_Luna: so just asking , how much time do you think you'll need ? take all the time you need tough
<Chimera> ?
<Reikim> Clearly this kid is underleveled. Those guys look like entry-level mooks.
<Shizuka> 13HUEEEAH
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a game...
<Little_Cloud> I never liked Code Lyoko much... *Hides form raging fans*
<RaveBrony> Dam Flood
<Ascendant> yeah Kosoveon
<CupcakeWarrior> So what would happen if Aelita died in the virtual world?
<Chimera> ah
<hen3ry> suddenly not useless?
<cachi01> Little_Cloud: same here
<Ascendant> Chimera
<Kosoveon> Othello the play>>>>>othello the game
<panda_> ingwaz: what breathing noises? :o
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF, they read shakespheres
<Ascendant> I've finished Othello
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: XANA wins

<panda_> ingwaz: xD
<Cypresswolf|Blind> those path need more railings
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Lyoko has a crap story. That's my main criticism.
<Alister> Gamer_Luna: cool
<Simon> Those towers look so much like a tall cigarette
<Shizuka> 13have to get to where they grow the beard
<Ascendant> Look up I, Iago by Nicole Galland
<RaveBrony> pony_9622: o_o
<Reikim> Odd, gettin' his swag on with the girls.
<tgl1992> o.o
<RAWRity> Yumi is the most physically capable of the three IRL, and the smartest. So WHY does she suck so bad in Lyoko?
<panda_> ingwaz: wait... you mean the little girls moaning?
<Little_Cloud> I want MLP! Not this...
<hen3ry> Simon: Well, it IS a French series
<Seastallion_of_War> And Riker's Season 1 plot chin :D
<cachi01> Y U NO LET HER DIE
<Sylandest> Shizuka: good analogy, hehe
<ingwaz> Shizuka: kid with the freak hair and the fur suit just kind of confuses me
<GabeMoist> Shizuka, they grow beards?
<ingwaz> panda_: yep
<Ascendant> And Iago: A Novel by Daniel Snodin
<Seastallion_of_War> his chin looked like a plot :D
<Reikim> Maid_Discord: No worse than most Western cartoons.
<Alister> Is this a guy ? LOOK AT HIS CLOTHES !

<Alister> owlicious: -_-
<cachi01> DONT ASK FOR PONIES
<Shizuka> 13season 2 they get into aelita's backstory and some insteresting situations, season 3 they do a lot of filling in for lyoko's history and even more interesting scenarios
<CK|Ded> Oshit
<Simon> hen3ry: I thought it was japan O_o
<Little_Cloud> Hey :Seastallion, to Paintchat?

<pony_9622> wtf why is half of this animation 2d and the other half 3d?
<Maid_Discord> 11,01But this show just has a weak story overall.

<ingwaz> Alister: yaranaika?
<panda_> Shizuka: yeah... I kinda dont like the first seasons... but it gets much better
<RaveBrony> o_o
<Pajaro> worth it

<Spell-of-Gaming> Good thing the first day of school is a half day. :)
<Ascendant> Iago is like
<Iron_Mare> Simon: Eeyup
<Reikim> Shizuka: I'm sorry, compulsive habit. Abusing genetics for plot angers me.
<necroshadow123> wat happen now
<Litwick> Shizuka: So Chaotic stole Code Lyoko's plot?
<pony_9622> I WANT MLP
<GarrettBrony> Please Stream Toonami
<Simon> Iron_Mare: cool
<BarbetosAMERICANSKI> Man I want some donuts.
<Pinkies4thWall> Where in the world is Sumica?
<Ascendant> "F*** YEAH, I ENGINEERED ALL OF THIS AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHY HAHAHA!"
<Pajaro> mmmmmm donuts n toonami
<PinkieSpice> o-o
<Shizuka> 13corner lyra is amused
<PinkieSpice> crap!

<PinkieSpice> im missing toonami!
<Iron_Mare> Wait... In this time i can get a donut
<cachi01> 3 days till E3 so who is ready!!!
<Iron_Mare> BRB EVERYPONY!!!
<Pajaro> wet noodles dont hurt.
<StupidSexyCJ> oh the darkness show! I love this episode
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh shit its almost E3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>brother playing Minecraft
<BarbetosAMERICANSKI> That sound sexual RaveBrony
<PinkieSpice> i want to go to e3 ;A;
<Reikim> It's like those old shows that say "Nuclear radiation? IT CAN DO ANYTHING!" Only now it's "Genetics? IT CAN DO ANYTHING!"
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>I can't see Toonami
<superretroworld> cachi01: EEEEEYUP
<Spell-of-Gaming> E3?!
<pony_9622> yay
<SaxyPretender> 0,14fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<Kosoveon> yes
<CupcakeWarrior> inb4 everyone complains about E3
<hen3ry> she'll take you for a ride on a slow boat to China...
<Shizuka> 13file it under rule of cool~
<Tovler> Its 2 days till E3 over here.
<RaveBrony> BarbetosAMERICANSKI: >_(\
<Ascendant> I lol'd pretty hard
<Kosoveon> and that's AFTER he gets stabbed multiple times
<drfsupercenter> 03http://chzfailnation.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/epic-fail-no-room-for-zombies-fail.jpg
<GarrettBrony> SaxyPretender Its on right now
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I know ;__;
<Ascendant> doesn't he only get stabbed once?
<Pinkies4thWall> SaxyPretender: I blame Minecraft for your lack of xboxing
<Simon> Hong Kong has no E3
*CupcakeWarrior hugs SaxyPretender
<cachi01> CupcakeWarrior: but what if THE 3 gets announceed :O
<Pajaro> KINECT
<CK|Ded> E3? Oh, right, that
<Ascendant> and he's like
<Ascendant> "I bleed, sir, but not killed" *smirk*
<Ponies47> Has never watched Toonami :$
<Kyiko> Toonami Aftermath streams toonami 24/7
<Pajaro> microsoft rustlin yo jimmies
<Shizuka> 13since the scanners are, by design, converting your genetics into code, presumably it has many ways of making sure that process doesn't go wrong
<Kyiko> go there
<CK|Ded> I can't say I actually care
<CupcakeWarrior> They better announce an MLP game at E3
<Kosoveon> as far as I remember, Othello stabbed him when he initially found out about his plot, and after he is contrained by the dukes he breaks free and stabs him again
<HatsuneMikuFan> Ponies47: I'm so sorry
<GabeMoist> Ohai Saxy
<Simon> Sumica: you afk, I mad
<Kosoveon> and yes lol
<Pajaro> KINECT
<Ascendant> and then Othello's all "screw you, I don't care, I want to die anyway"
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh hai GabeMoist
<Ascendant> no
<Herp_Derp> yay
<Pinkies4thWall> Shizuka: dat failsafe
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi SaxyPretender
<cachi01> KINECT
<RaveBrony> Oh leave Sumica alone :D
<Pajaro> ya
<Tovler> I b4 flamewar about how horrible EA, Capcom, etc are.
<Ascendant> Othello tries to stab him
<Ponies47> HatsuneMikuFan: Why? What's wrong?
<cachi01> SUCKS
<Pajaro> yay
<cachi01> KINECT
<necroshadow123> lets just watch somting plz
<cachi01> SUCKS
<junh1024-XD> inb4 http://www.lulu.com/shop/fotie-photenhauer/natural-harvest-a-collection-of-semen-based-recipes/paperback/product-20052760.html
<Reikim> Shizuka: Yeah, I'm going to ignore the fact that your genetic code is not all that you are, and file it under Rule of Cool like you said -.-
<Chimera> Ascendant lawl
<Ascendant> But Montano disarms him before he can
<Herp_Derp> yay
<Shizuka> 13a lock of hair is an extreme case, but if the scanners operate on just part of your genetics, plus the magic to keep your spirit going, then it's conceivable that the lock of hair is enough
<Derplexia> Yay !
<Simon> GabeMoist: ni hao
<Chimera> Fun fact
<CupcakeWarrior> Wait a minut
<HatsuneMikuFan> Ponies47: You've never watch Toonami
<Ascendant> And then Iago stabs Emilia
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Ascendant> and runs off
<Pajaro> :S
<drfsupercenter> 03darn, I can't find it
<drfsupercenter> 03the book is too new
<drfsupercenter> 03w/e
<Reikim> Shizuka: Oh, we're getting spirit in on this now? All bets are off then.
<Ascendant> and when he's brought back
<CupcakeWarrior> Shizuka is pink, could that mean she is Aelita?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...all this talk of scanners is reminding me of Tron: Legacy
<Chimera> Iago is, I think, the only Shakesperian villain to live to the end of the play
<Shizuka> 13probably like way way too much redundancy built into the process
<Ascendant> Yes Chimera
<Ascendant> quite ironic
<Chimera> yeah
<Herp_Derp> HatsuneMikuFan: YAY! HATSUNE MIKUUU
<drfsupercenter> 03Shakespeare didn't even exist
<Ponies47> HatsuneMikuFan: Soooooooo? What's wrong with dat? :$
<cachi01> kinect sucks, ps move 50/50, wii just YES
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate to burst your bubble
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Chimera> you're a pessamist
<Chimera> :p
<Pajaro> 6_9:S<3:|:P:'(:(:)<3:O:$
<drfsupercenter> 03not really
<Chimera> and one of THOSE I see xD
<Kosoveon> even if he didn't so what lol
<CK|Ded> Here, let me save everyone from getting hopes up. Here's this year's E3 in a nutshell....Nintendo: Wii U, Sony: HERE HAVE MOAR 3D, Microsoft: WHY WON'T ANYONE BUY OUR KINECTS?
<Kosoveon> the plays exist
<Reikim> Shizuka: I know, I know. I'm just emphasizing here that having someone's genetic sequence does not allow you to reconstruct that person.
<drfsupercenter> 03I was just saying
<Ascendant> neither of the books, drf?
<junh1024-XD> inb4 he can't even spell his own name consistently
<Spell-of-Gaming> I registered to the Japanese Nico Nico Douga with only Google Translate. :P
<Shizuka> 13jeremie's operating on the assumption that aelita is a program, so given that, a lock of hair could indeed contain her entire state in DNA
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant, the I, Iago one
<drfsupercenter> 03then again
<Kosoveon> play enjoy them, everyone's happy
<drfsupercenter> 03I just use google
<drfsupercenter> 03so can you
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Kosoveon> *people
<HyperMetalLugia> maybe he was dyslexic
<HatsuneMikuFan> Ponies47: Nothing really. Just that you missed some awesone stuff
<Iron_Mare> back
<Ascendant> I, Iago by Nicole Galland and Iago: A Novel by Daniel Snodin?
<Pinkies4thWall> Pajaro: no emote spam
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Chimera> Koso lolyeah
<Reikim> Shizuka: So her DNA is constantly changing?
<Ascendant> I can't find them drf
<cachi01> CK|Ded: xd but dishonored!!! dishonored will be announced
<HatsuneMikuFan> Herp_Derp: /)
<Ascendant> I've tried
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Pajaro> ok sorry
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Pajaro, watch the emote spam
<Shizuka> 13possibly
<drfsupercenter> 03I tried the first one
<necroshadow123> tis almost midnight where i am
<cachi01> CK|Ded: nd also the new tomb raidr!
<Reikim> Shizuka: More willing to accept that, then.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's on Kindle for $10 LOL
<Tovler> I hope M$ has another Sesame Street game during the press conference.
<drfsupercenter> 03so you could read it on your computer
<cachi01> CK|Ded: and gta v!
<Kosoveon> and yes I just looked it up ascendant, you're right, I apologize
<cachi01> and luigis mansion 2!
<Herp_Derp> know what, i think we should watch metalocalypse...
<Pajaro> oh right gta v
<CK|Ded> cachi01: So nothing anyone should care about?
<Ascendant> hurr no need to apologise :p
<CupcakeWarrior> Sumica: You bstill alive?
<drfsupercenter> 03what the frick
<drfsupercenter> 03Searching for: Iago: A Novel Did you mean Iago ah Novel?
<Pinkies4thWall> guys guess what?
<cachi01> CK|Ded: LUIGIS MANSION 2!
<Ascendant> lmfaaaaaaaaao drf
<Kosoveon> LOL
<Herp_Derp> yay!
<GarrettBrony> what
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<HatsuneMikuFan> yay
<drfsupercenter> 03my library has both
<drfsupercenter> 03but only the books
<Reikim> Herp_Derp: I think that requires Val...whom I have not seen recently, surprisingly.
<Twilight_Sparkle^_^> yaaaaaaaaaay
<drfsupercenter> 03not electronic ones
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<Pinkies4thWall> I has a baconator
<Ponies47> HatsuneMikuFan: I see. I really don't watch TV anymore. The Internet is killing TV :$
<cachi01> CK|Ded: wait that was already announced :l
<drfsupercenter> 03sometimes thuey have ebooks
<drfsupercenter> 03that are free to library card holders XD
<Shizuka> 13later on we discover that you need to be prescanned sort of in order to be virtualized... this whole problem breaks down during the transfer from lyoko to earth
<Iron_Mare> LUIGIS MANSION 2? ALL OF MY YES
<Ascendant> Ah
<Reikim> Ponies47: Commercials are killing TV.
<CK|Ded> cachi01: Last year's E3 was sincerely disappointing. There were better games released over the course of the following year than the ones showcased during E3.
*Tovler still refuses to believe that Luigi's Mansion 2 exists.
<Ascendant> well I'd love both books
<pony_9622> YAY
<Ascendant> but I can't find them anywhere
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh crap, /i need to go study for my finals D:
<drfsupercenter> 03Kindle
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<cachi01> CK|Ded: yeah well lets just watch it and see if anypony surprises us
<SaxyPretender> 0,14what would make my E3 is Sega re-confirming Anarchy Reigns for the US
<Ascendant> and lol bookstores are crap
<Herp_Derp> Reikim: D:
<Athgaar> ʸᵃʸ﻿
<Ascendant> I don't have a kindle
<Ascendant> ._.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL BOOKSTORES
<HatsuneMikuFan> Ponies47: Same here. But Toonami was all i watch when I was a kid
<drfsupercenter> 03there's a Kindle program for PC I think
<cachi01> CK|Ded: if not get the shtguns
<Ponies47> Reikim; I hate commercials :[
<Shizuka> 13so if that prescan packs in some extra stuff into your genetics (or whatever there is to define YOU it works on), then there you have it
<HyperMetalLugia> there is
<CupcakeWarrior> Ohai Phase4
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> and online too
<HyperMetalLugia> used it a couple times
<drfsupercenter> 03but LOL paying for books
<GarrettBrony> I dont watch Tv anymore. The only things I watch is MST3k Ponies. And Anything Streamed on Bronystate
<drfsupercenter> 03oh well
<HyperMetalLugia> decent enough
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Kosoveon> IMHO, physical books>ebooks, most of the time
<drfsupercenter> 03I had to buy one through Google
<Phase4> 00,02ohai CupcakeWarrior
<HyperMetalLugia> ebook pirating ftw
<drfsupercenter> 03IMO, movies > books
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<RaveBrony> Phase4? Where?
<CK|Ded> cachi01: I wouldn't expect much, all the same.
<Twi_Fi> Hello Phase4
<Shizuka> 13not so much that the genetics are always changing, just some part that indicates your state in and out of lyoko, that the scanner can do a ton of error correction on to keep you consistent on both sides
<Phase4> 00,02RaveBrony, behind you :P
<Ascendant> yeah Kosoveon
<Pinkies4thWall> SuperBrony64|DOG: will just be happy something's out for Wii U
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Twi_Fi
<Shizuka> 13it's all off the top of my head though, way into BS territory :3
<drfsupercenter> 03also, take ebook, go to public library, hit print
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03profit
*drfsupercenter hides
*Phase4 00,02hugs Shizuka
<Ascendant> I prefer real books to eboots
<Tovler> I can't wait for Nintendo to confirm for the 3rd E3 in a row that Animal Crossing 3DS is coming.
<Ascendant> lmfao drf
<Shizuka> 13phase~
<Reikim> Shizuka: Well that works a little better. If we get souls or whatever to cover the psychological situation, then we're good.
<RaveBrony> Phase4: Ahh!! You scared me! D:
<Ponies47> HatsuneMikuFan: I see. I watched all kinds of (squee). But now it's mostley ponies :)
<drfsupercenter> 03I do that at my school

<Sylandest> howdy, Phase4! How are you tonight?
<Ascendant> wtf
<drfsupercenter> 03problem, school?
<HyperMetalLugia> How to pirate ebooks- 1. Buy ebook, 2 decrypt it, 3. Make 2 PDF, 4. Send
<Simon> hi Phase4
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Reikim> Shizuka: I just don't like how they abuse the term DNA.
<drfsupercenter> 03basically
<BarbetosAMERICANSKI> Ugh the total lack of snack food in my home is disturbing.
*Pinkies4thWall brushes Phase4's mane
<CupcakeWarrior> I hope Nintendo announces SSB on the 3DS
<drfsupercenter> 03I even have a PDF unlocker
<hen3ry> DNA is magic
<cachi01> ^
<Ascendant> yeah I'm gonna walk around the internet with eboots
<Ascendant> :}D
<Iron_Mare> Hello Phase4
<drfsupercenter> 03that can get rid of alol thost stupid no-printing restrictions
<Simon> hen3ry: DNA is science
<hen3ry> but screw RNA
<drfsupercenter> 03eboots are a term for Sony homebrew
<superretroworld> Pinkies4thWall: been reading the my little dashie story, its so cute :)
<drfsupercenter> 03:|
*CupcakeWarrior brushes Pinkies4thWall
<drfsupercenter> 03eboot.bin
<Kosoveon> it's the same with movies, video games, music, etc
<CK|Ded> cachi01: Worth noting that the most anticipated thing other than Wii U last year was the PS Vita....which got lambasted for being too expensive, not at all unique, and forcing you to buy AT&T service to use it.
<Pajaro> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W28xBHMKpo
<Reikim> inb4 CupcakeWarrior is disappointed
<Ascendant> drf help me get I, Iago and Iago: A Novel ):
<Pajaro> you're welcome
*Pinkies4thWall is brushied
<Spell-of-Gaming> They already announced SSB on the 3DS last E3
<drfsupercenter> 03can you pay for them>?
<derp> yes chat is working now for me hi every pony i has a internetz:)
<Phase4> 00,02Sylandest, i'm good

<Ponies47> Pajaro: NO VIDEO LINKS! :[
<Ascendant> If only I could
<drfsupercenter> 03can SOMEONE pay for them
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Iron_Mare and Simon
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<CK|Ded> cachi01: So....brace for disappointment so that you don't get surprised.
<drfsupercenter> 03I dunno
<drfsupercenter> 03are you worth $10?
<Phase4> 00,02Pinkies4thWall, ^_^
<Alister> hello ?
<drfsupercenter> 03let me think
<Pajaro> IM SORRY
<cachi01> CK|Ded: i have a ps vita and i dont need AT&t :S
<CupcakeWarrior> Reikim: We will all be dissapointed when no mlp games are announced
<Sylandest> Phase4: good to hear. I'm completely exhausted in every way possible, lol
<Ascendant> am I a prostitute? no
<Alister> silly me I never left
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Ascendant> That's Bianca
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi Phase4
<Ponies47> Hey hey hey Pajaro :)
<Reikim> Hello Alister.
<drfsupercenter> 03if you were, $10 would be really lowballing it
*drfsupercenter hides
<CK|Ded> cachi01: Do you use their Wi-Fi?
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Phase4> 00,02ohai
<Pinkies4thWall> SSB will be on 3DS coinciding with Wii U most likely
<HyperMetalLugia> or
<Pajaro> *hands up*
<HyperMetalLugia> lowblowing
<HyperMetalLugia> ;D
<drfsupercenter> 03let me look up the other one
<drfsupercenter> 03I, Iago was $10
<Alister> Reikim : you seen my OC ? http://alisterchop.deviantart.com/art/Alister-OC-306017175
<Kosoveon> aws, you don't need to do that
<Ascendant> k thanks
<Kosoveon> :<
<Ponies47> Pajaro: It's ok :)
<Reikim> CupcakeWarrior: Very good point. At least we'll have Fighting is Magic to look forward to
<cachi01> CK|Ded: nopee my ps vita is wifi only not 3g
<Ascendant> lmfao Koso
<Ascendant> Bianca is lulzy
<drfsupercenter> 03that one's $15
<drfsupercenter> 03so
<Reikim> Alister: Indeed.
<Ascendant> in the 1995 film
<Kosoveon> yea she is
<CK|Ded> cachi01: Ah, smart lad. Their 3G is AT&T only.
<drfsupercenter> 03$25 total
<drfsupercenter> 03for both books
<Ascendant> her... boobs
<drfsupercenter> 03in electronic format
<Reikim> Alister: Seems to be missing a cutie mark.
<HatsuneMikuFan> I'm only buying a Wii U for SSB, Pokemon, Zelda, and maybe some other games
<drfsupercenter> 03I heard boobs, what are we talking about
*drfsupercenter runs
<Kosoveon> I WILL NOT BE YOUR HOBBY HORSE
<Ponies47> Pajaro: Did you read the rules of Bronystate?
<CupcakeWarrior> Why is that bad CK|Ded?
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Reikim> HatsuneMikuFan: Well worth it, in my opinion.
<cachi01> CK|Ded:damn didnt knew that O_O
<Pinkies4thWall> SSB is the only reason i'd get a Wii U
<drfsupercenter> 03no but seriously
<drfsupercenter> 03$10 for one, $15 for the other
<Kosoveon> not only is the statement itself funny, but the pun it invokes is even more so
<superretroworld> Pinkies4thWall: you may havent rememberedd, but thats for linking me the story :)
<Alister> Reikim: I can't draw one so I left it blank . But Gamer_Luna is drawing one with a cutie mark
<Iron_Mare> And Legends of Equestria :D
<drfsupercenter> 03HML, can you convert Kindle books to PDF?
<CK|Ded> CupcakeWarrior: Because AT&T blows just as much as Verizon for equally obvious reasons.
<Pajaro> i'll do that right now :S
<HyperMetalLugia> uh
<cachi01> a sequel of majoras mask is the reason i will get a WII U
<HyperMetalLugia> *some8
<Pinkies4thWall> superretroworld: yeah i forgot
<HyperMetalLugia> depends on DRM type
<CupcakeWarrior> CK|Ded: Why are they bad?
<CK|Ded> CupcakeWarrior: And most people would rather not be bound and gagged to one provider.
<HyperMetalLugia> I swear I had a program which did it
<HyperMetalLugia> I did do it last year
<HyperMetalLugia> but I deleted it
<Gamer_Luna> Alister I didn't draw the whole body,sorry about that.Here's The picture :) http://kinzsaw.deviantart.com/art/Request-4-Alister-306022889
<HyperMetalLugia> lemme find it
<Tovler> I'd only buy a Wii U for Pikmin 3, Rayman Legends, NSMB Mii, Zelda, SSBU… I guess its time to give up Pizza for a while.
<Pinkies4thWall> cachi01: since when has LoZ done sequels?
<Ascendant> yeah Kosoveon
<CK|Ded> CupcakeWarrior: Hm, let me go open up my phone bill so I can tell you
*Pinkies4thWall eats BACONATOR

<Simon> Sumica: where are you?

<derp> yea i noticed
<cachi01> DAT WHOOO SCARED ME
<HatsuneMikuFan> SaxyPretender: I completely forgot about Pikmin 3 :O
<CK|Ded> CupcakeWarrior: AT&T provides the same service for a hell of a lot more money, and with much more dickish customer service and increasingly harsher restrictions to their phone plans. Thus, most people don't want to stick with them.
<Simon> Sumica: please wake up
<Shizuka> 13hey Sumi do your Ric Flair impression!

<CupcakeWarrior> Shizuka: But I dont want to nom your foot D:

<Reikim> Sumica: I am loving Korra. It's just as good as the original Avatar, and possibly even better.
<CupcakeWarrior> That explains why she isnt smiling :P
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Grey DeLise is up there with Tara Strong in terms of number of voice roles

<CK|Ded> RAWRity: Iroh was established as the most amusing character by 8 eps in, he just hadn't gotten crazy funny yet
<Reikim> Use the little kid as a weapon. That always goes over well.

<Shizuka> 13that too
<Biglaw> hiya RainBow
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: the sound might depend on properties of the *capacitor* and energy of lightning

<Reikim> Shizuka: Also, Azula doesn't exactly have the best relationship with logic...
<RustyMeat> Actually I lied

<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: her lightning dont even kill people, so they may be weaker than tesla coil
<Ascendant> okay
<Ascendant> done compiling
<Dark_Horst> it's a TRAP
<Ascendant> just need to move over the config
<drfsupercenter> 03good, now get back to work

<cachi01> U DARE SPEAK LIKE THAT TO UNCLE?
<Ascendant> I have work to do
<derp> now its around 6 seconds behind now 7
<Shizuka> 13the way iroh talks later about lightning, they're probably channeling it away from important stuff like the heart and muscles
<Tovler> RAWRity: Lucky
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: Im not sure if I am going to get tht
<HatsuneMikuFan> RAWRity: I still need to do that
<Shizuka> 13else at the very least she should be crumpled into a ball when lightning bending :3
<MahBoi777> cachi01: kids today lol
<Reikim> Shizuka: So...where are they channeling it?
<derp> now maby 9 secs back
<Athgaar> in the air
<Shizuka> 13um.... magic? :3
<Athgaar> can't you see it
<ingwaz> Shizuka: channeling it to the heart and muscles is the best part though
<SaxyPretender> 0,14snort
<Iron_Mare> GIVE IT UP BABY, I HAVE STUDIED ALL YOUR MOVES
<Tovler> I'll wait to see if B/W 2 will be directly downloadable on the 3DS.
<Shizuka> 13mm not quite the air, it's only from her fingertips, not coming along her arm or something
<RustyMeat> GOOD NIGHT
<Shizuka> 13but like fire, they bring combustion from nothing
<cachi01> night RustyMeat"
<Ponies47> Magic *snort* *snort*
<Maid_Discord> 11,01If the lightning ran through their muscles, their bodies would seize up.
<Reikim> Well, the other way to stop the war is to let the Fire Lord win...sooo...
<Tovler> It's Crumbelievable!
<panda_> Shizuka: I think it might be from the narutal electrons and friction from within the body and fire is from out natural heatt ^^
<Kencolt> Well... that was insane and incredibly fun. I just met with a couple of friends... on WoW-- and we three-stormed a trio of old raids for fun. I FINALLY got to see Onyxia. AND got the "we Need More Dots" achieve.
<CupcakeWarrior> BY CELESTIAS BEARD!
<Tovler> By Celestia's Beard!
<RAWRity> Shizuka: it's explained as them channeling their Chi into energy.
<Ascendant> and island just pinged again
<Pinkies4thWall> zuzu is naive
<Sumica> 00,10ouch
<Iron_Mare> BEARDS
<CK|Ded> \\\\\\\\\\\\||
<Reikim> Quick question: if the Fire Lord died, who actually believes that the war would stop?
<derp> wow now my computer is now mor syncd past my phone
<Ascendant> or not
<cachi01> damn
<CK|Ded> Whoops. Sorry, kitty on keyboard
<Iron_Mare> THIS IS WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT!
<Ponies47> :o
<Shizuka> 13probably depends on what it grounds to, but their chi could be building up a metric ton of electrons at their fingertips
<cachi01> avatar vs avatar!
<Ponies47> ^
<Iron_Mare> BEARDS ON EVERYPONY!
<Iron_Mare> ME GUSTA
<CK|Ded> Say hai, little kitty! *makes him wave a little paw*
<Shizuka> 13but the bolt dissipates into air so..
<Shizuka> 13MAGIC!
<CupcakeWarrior> CK|Ded: ewww cats
<Shizuka> 13snort snort :3
<Kencolt> Oh, this is the one with the insanely STUPID general.
<Ponies47> Shixuka: yay :)
<Athgaar> foreshadowig
<Athgaar> ng
<SaxyPretender> 0,14daww, cats
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: bolts generally dissipate into ground tho, dont they?
*Tovler liked JC's Avatar because he likes 80s movies.
<Ponies47> *Shizuka
<Kosoveon> what kinds of problems is island having?
<CK|Ded> CupcakeWarrior: WAT
<Reikim> inb4 Azula's planning something. Oh wait, she's always planning something.
<Shizuka> 13yeah usually they're grounded by... well... ground
<Kosoveon> that is making it act funky
<drfsupercenter> 03the same problems as usual, random disconnection
<CupcakeWarrior> CK|Ded: Dogs are better
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not sure
<CK|Ded> My kitty is my baby
<drfsupercenter> 03all I do is pay for it :/
<Shizuka> 13or a buildup of positrons elsewhere in a cloud
<drfsupercenter> 03but I won't be anymore
<Ponies47> :O
<drfsupercenter> 03once we get it moved over
<cachi01> my baby is my kitty
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll just cancel the stupid thing
<GarrettBrony> When I hear the name Avatar. I think of Ultima
<Athgaar> positrons wat
<RAWRity> Actually, it's said earlier in the series that Firebenders use a "grounded" stance when fighting, and when you break their root stance, it weakens their attacks.
<Pinkies4thWall> DAFUQ?
<CupcakeWarrior> CK|Ded: Actually, Im fine with kitties as long as they arent evil
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: i didnt get that bit about how they dissipate in air
<Ascendant> I need to
<Athgaar> you do realize positrons are antimatter equivalents of electrons right
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: or do you mean in the show?
<Sumica> 00,10Clearly it's gravitons
<Ascendant> find island's details again
<RAWRity> That's how Zuko beats Zhao in an Agni Kai in the third episode.
<Kencolt> Yes! The General who does NOT get it! I OLOVE this one!
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: yeah in the show
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: oh ok sorry i wasnt watching
<Pinkies4thWall> killing your only weapon= SMART
<Iron_Mare> Trys to win a war with avatar state, gets destroyed by it.... seems legit.
<Tovler> Giant yen tokens
<Shizuka> 13the lightning doesn't connect with anything most of the time
<Reikim> Shizuka: When in doubt? It's probably something quantum.
<Shizuka> 13it's just a bolt into nothing
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: yeah thats silly
<Ascendant> fml
<drfsupercenter> 03heh
<panda_> Shizuka: well... it would be a 1 hit KO if it did...
<Ascendant> it was zen.xzbition.com or something

<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: XD
<Ponies47> SO MUCH YAY! 6_9
<Shizuka> 13but sumica, we determined that the tornado in hurricane fluttershy is the proper size given the amount of water they're lifting and how fast the ponies are flying
<Iron_Mare> Now, I DEMAND ANOTHER EXPLOSION!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14uuugh, I want to see Casshern sINS RIGHT NOW

<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: As any conflict progresses, both sides become more and more prone to silly decisions. See: Hitler trying to invade Russia in the middle of WINTER while Great Britain wasn't quite dead yet.

<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: if they realized the fire nation knew then they would understand that the fire lord would move to another city and there would be 0 chance, there would be nobody to attack
<CK|Ded> LOVE cancer
<CK|Ded> :D
<Darkts3> =/
<Pinkies4thWall> LOL /) Sumica
<cachi01> HatsuneMikuFan: both the D and sokkas version

<Sumica> 00,10cancer
<CK|Ded> 80?
<Dark_Horst> well, that'S an entrance
<cachi01> DAMN CANCER
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: this is entirely different, hitler was trying to do blitzkrieg, if he waited it wouldnt work
<ingwaz> Sumica: testicular cancer
<otakon> Sumica: not really
<Darkts3> here comes the good scene
<PNKI> probabl does
<sub06905> they have tamed the badgers
<otakon> Sumica: plus, thought he was 70
<RAWRity> Sumica: He dies at 66
<CK|Ded> According to official timelines, he's about 60-some when he dies IIRC
<HatsuneMikuFan> cachi01: oh
<otakon> WHAT ARE THEY SAYING!?
<Cypresswolf|Blind> I Like Sokka's lack of though :D
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Same thing. Look, are you going to call that decision a plothole?
<Darkts3> =/
<Spectrum_Rush> MahBoi777: tired, fine but tired, really shouldn't be on but watcha goin do lol
<otakon> so much facepalming
<CupcakeWarrior> NO WAI
<PNKI> no shit facepalm
<Kencolt> That's why.
<HatsuneMikuFan> You Don't Say
<RyunosukeKnT> that red spot from all the facepalms

<hen3ry> thats how you become avatar. facehoof!
<MahBoi777> Spectrum_Rush: Lol good for u
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: um yes? how can you possibly say its not?
<Darkts3> Hippie Hug
<RAWRity> Reikim: He calls everything in the series a plothole if it isn't immediately explained.
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Hitler's decision?
<Tovler> That flashback thingy in today's Korra might imply that Aang was assassinated.
*Spectrum_Rush yawns
<panda_> sokka learned LOVE AND TOLERANCE :D
<RAWRity> Reikim: and no amount of discussion is going to change his mind.
<Pinkies4thWall> inb4 james cameron
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim no, i explained why he did it...
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: go watch the ending of ME3, THAT should give you something to pick apart
<RAWRity> Don't waste your keyboard strokes.
<Darkts3> PAUSE?
<otakon> the hell?
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: You fail on knowing what a blitzkrieg is anyway. He had non-agression with Russia. Attacking AT THAT TIME was not necessary and got his troops killed.
<Kencolt> No. Sokka learned how to survive insane hippies.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14did right channel come on
<Phase4> 00,02wait...
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: that would bo fun if even you dont defend it:P

<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Sumica> 00,10so I rewound
<otakon> Cypresswolf|Blind: no idea, technical difficulties it seems
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: He blitzkrieg'd Britain, failed to follow through with it, tried it on Russia IN THE WINTER and failed, and the rest is history.
<CupcakeWarrior> De ja vu
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: i know what blitzkrieg is. stalin was also planning an attack, he couldnt have waited
<RAWRity> and then FMA Brotherhood was on
<Tovler> A DARK Templar

<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: no, because then staling would attack..
<RyunosukeKnT> XD
<otakon> wait, they went BACK to Omashu and it got conquered
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: If he'd actually properly killed Great Britain, he could have fended off Stalin.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<Darkts3> LUNA IS BEST NATION
<otakon> eh, this doesn't really work
<Kencolt> Reikim: As shown at least onec every week on the Military Channel, and once a month on H2.
<sub06905> thats only 2 nations
<RainBowJack> lol
<Cypresswolf|Blind> Have I mentioned I love this fandom? :)
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Either way, attacking IN WINTER was completely retarded.

*SaxyPretender grooves like a cat
<cachi01> hi Monfang!
<Monfang> So I'm back from an internal debate with myself.

<FlareChaser> Needs more Sniper.
<diddutz> I want a strange Item like a "server cleaning banhammer"
<sub06905> lol
<ingwaz> Sumica: i need the link to this video, if its on youtube
<otakon> and Meanwhile would be proud
<PNKI> love this vid
<Monfang> The subject today was how people are using the fact that WoW is lossing subscriptions as a mark that making a game casual is a bad business move.
<RAWRity> It started off as criticising a show, now it's turned into an analysis of WWII Battcle strategy. I love it.
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: yeah? do nt make such disgusting claims as to me defending hitler, im only explaining his actions in terms of when he attacked, not reasoning
<Cypresswolf|Blind> Does this make us all ban evaders? :P
<Tovler> I guess this was playing when prince-lemon banned me for no reason
<HatsuneMikuFan> otakon: lol
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: DO IT

<Sumica> 00,10yeah Shizuka asked to do some rifftracks for you all
<hen3ry> ah, bacon and applejack.
<derp> yeaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: They could have not taken advantage of the eclipse. Then they could have gone through with a much, much longer war, which they probably would have lost. They gambled everything on one chance, however small. Just as Hitler did.
<otakon> Shizuka: they no look like fleas?
<Shizuka> 13<33
<MahBoi777> Lol Shizuka
<diddutz> SHOO-BE-DOO SHOO-SHOO-BE-DO

<CK|Ded> Er, actually, Hitler didn't "have to" attack Stalin in winter. He could have just held the line to prevent Stalin's attack, he CHOSE to advance deep into Siberia during the Russian winter. So yeah, he's still a moron for what he did. >_>
<Pinkies4thWall> RainBowJack: he's done
<otakon> Sumica: sweet

<otakon> Shizuka: Did I mention I wub you?
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: love your streams, but yay Shizuka
<Monfang> And there are several other facts that make using the subscription lose as an attack against WoW going casual a poor move.
<RainBowJack> Facken and flapeljack
*otakon hugs Shizuka
<Pinkies4thWall> RainBowJack: this is the vid he shows when hes done
<derp> i luv you seaponies
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: But it was better than nothing. Just like how Hitler was screwed, but still went after the Soviets.

<Sumica> 00,10I think no one streamer is better then another we all have diffrent streams to keep it intersting ^_^
<CK|Ded> Shizuka: EXACTLY. The key to war is keeping your pimp hand strong, just like in Risk.
<Shizuka> 13the blue cat people, not the terribad nickelodeon movie
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Risk doesn't
<CupcakeWarrior> Everyone, prepare for 2 and a half hours of riffing
<panda_> BACON AND APPLE JACK
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Thus, my point is demonstrated: a bad decision is not, necessarily, a plothole. You can call it retarded, just don't call it a plothole.
<Monfang> First, the WoW players are growing up, getting jobs and responciblities and they don't have time to play WoW nor the desire to pay the 15 dollars a month.
<cachi01> bacon and applejack!
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: the whole idea was to surprise them during the eclipse. if the fire nation knew, they would just move the firelord somewhere else, and make a trap. bam, wheres your chance?

<Shizuka> 13please refresh your streams~
<Sumica> 00,10oh I am not leaving.
<Monfang> In 20 or 30 years, we are going to see subscriptoins shoot back up as players start to enter retirement and get jobs that grant them free time so they can play the MMOs again.
<Tovler> oh dat sumica
<Spectrum_Rush> been here the whole time CupcakeWarrior but hai all the same

<CK|Ded> Blue cat people, IIRC.
<Monfang> The second problem is that WoW isn't going 'casual'. It is getting the kinks and bugs out. Think about it, WoW was the first truely MASSIVE Multiplayer game. They are the first to encounter problems that others did not. Them giving blue marks on the map and 'hand holding' as the die hard gamers call it is really them working out kinks to make the game more fun.
<RaveBrony> o.o

<Twi_Fi> FlareChaser: Dat impossible task.
<CupcakeWarrior> I love how Pandora is a moon of Jupiter

<Kencolt> Monfang: There's not a single "hardcore " WoW p[layer I ever met that could handle that game. And well, I had an easier time finding friends in FF11, but that's partly because you could NOT LEVEL UP EXCEPT WITH A FULL PARTY.
<otakon> hiya Rain

<Tovler> TeamBreezy
<Shizuka> 13Tovler: oh god i want them to riff twister so much
<Monfang> Right. So let me ask again, Kencolt. Do you think more people played ahd had fun with The original Mario Brothers or with Super Mario Brothers?
<MahBoi777> bye RaveBrony! take care!

<otakon> :P
<FlareChaser> SaxyPretender: do you love me? :(
<Darkts3> Shizuka: lol
<Kencolt> And youhad to NOT be a jerk. And you had to deal with the fact that half the time half of your party only spoke Japanese, and the both of you had to learn how to use the auto-translators.
<Sumica> 00,10but it was part of the big oscarshow thing they did
<CK|Ded> Weeblos
<CK|Ded> XD
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: No, not at all. I very much believe that real people, in such a situation, would actually potentially make that decision.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>.>
<Shizuka> 13aw
<Darkts3> oh god.. Matrix Revolution Bot
<Tovler> Shizuka: They constantly make jabs at Twister but they've never done it
<Kencolt> And I have no opinion about Mario.
<cachi01> FREEDOM
<HatsuneMikuFan> I'm off too
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: The one thing that defies all rational logic - the ONLY thing - is the human mind.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Night everypony
<Spectrum_Rush> Darkts3: ikr
<FlareChaser> SaxyPretender: ...wha...why... :'(
<Darkts3> hm.. cannibals?
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: wouldnt you, for example, agree that the part where they attacked the fire nation and were caught by surprise in the trap, even though they knew azula knew their plans, is a huge plot hole
<otakon> LOL
<RyunosukeKnT> lol
<Tovler> night, HatsuneMikuFan

<CupcakeWarrior> Whats so bad about papyrus font?
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: give me a single reason the firelord would return during the siege,
<Reikim> I'm going to sum up everything said over the next two hours: the plot isn't all that great. But the special effects are like SEX mixed with MORE SEX.
<VioletGreySha> hay MahBoi777 iam fine just woke up

<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: I'm not arguing that. I'm arguing that humans are stupid and make stupid decision.
<RAWRity> Shizuka: especially thanks to this movie.
<FlareChaser> Shizuka: Human Paladins are overused..
<otakon> Shizuka: COMIC SANS
<CupcakeWarrior> Shizuka: But I like comic sans
<Alchemist> otakon: for example how do they communicate with the Avatars? Radio? Then how can they communicate with them near the tree?
<Tovler> I hope nothing happens to the Deku tree in this movie.
<Kencolt> Oh, this... not a movie I'm interested in. WQell, I'm off... dailies and dungeons to do.

<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: i cant think of a single reason why he would return. to attack anyway you would have to have the intellect of an animal that acts on impulse. are the main heros animals?
<FlareChaser> VioletGreySha: ahaha, nice :P
<RAWRity> Good lord, this guy's voice.
<RAWRity> WE KNOW YOU'RE AUSTRALIAN.

<EnderKingMummy> <3 cute
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But...I already bought him when he was a puppy O~O
<RAWRity> What I find funny is, all the special effects and grand visual expanses in this film were already achieved 30 years ago by Studio Ghibli with Nausicaa, and for considerably less money.
<drfsupercenter> 03which I can't find for free :/
<Sumica> 00,10in thiory
<CK|Ded> xD
<Reikim> Shizuka: I can inform you, with 100% certainty, that corporate greed is very good at taking crap writers and cranking out sequels out of ANYTHING.
<FlareChaser> Dogs are the WORST pets ever.

<otakon> SaxyPretender: WHO SAID THAT?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02He was at PetSmart with us and he was buying stuff 3

<SuperBrony64> 11,02:3
<Tovler> yeah, I defended this movie.
<CupcakeWarrior> DeathStar: The dogs name is Charlie

<FlareChaser> otakon: Iknow, who would say that?
<EnderKingMummy> feed him an apple
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Biglaw: No :<

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Biglaw: Never ;A;

<d3rb> he got legs! he knows how to use em!

<RAWRity> It just amuses me that they spent 300 million dollars and 5 years to achieve in live action what animation has been doing for decades with nearly no budget.
<otakon> lol
<CK|Ded> xD
<Twi_Fi> LOL
<Rain> Sumica, lower gravity allows for frailer bones, so the size would stay the same. Higher oxygen concentration allows for larger growth
<otakon> RAWRity: once again, agreed
<FlareChaser> SuperBrony64: :'(
<MahBoi777> d3rb: Lol
<Biglaw> And FlareChaser, I did have two cats, but they both died within a year of eachother
