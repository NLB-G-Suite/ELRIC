<RaveBrony> Meanwhile: Wut o_o
<Meanwhile> It bumped over a candle and set its tail alight. It was fine though.
<Eli> i never really played raids... it's totally boring after the first time...
<Buytoast> intellect no longer increases mana?
<Eli> pvp and that's that
<Buytoast> i know my cousin said something about fixed mana
<pony_1286> i just do raids for the gold
<Buytoast> but that's bullshit
<Meanwhile> Intellect, didn't they remove that?
<Molly> http://jayisgames.com/games/the-house-2/ Don't play this game
<Aryd> its fixed at 200k at 90, 100k at 85
<pony_1286> the real gameplay is the pvp
<Buytoast> all PVP is is who can ambush who first
<Meanwhile> ^
<Eli> pony_1286: exactly
<pony_1286> rogues
<pony_1286> lawl
<Aryd> I think arena has some elements of skill in it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Does anyone else think LFR is utter crap?
<Eli> Buytoast: ... you didn't have many good runs then
<mentallyeffedguy> why is the movie night beginning so damn late?!
<Meanwhile> Ofc LFR is utter crap, is was made for the people who can't play.
<Eli> Aryd: arenas are pvp
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have 102K mana
<Aryd> That would be your head meta gem
<Buytoast> i've had plenty of good runs
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Due to my Human bonus
<Buytoast> and it's still teh truth
<SparklyWaffles> Hello everypony. :)
<Meanwhile> And Ragnaros was the hardest heroic in Cata, Dragon Soul was pathetic.
<AJIsAwesome> SparklyWaffles: Hi! :)
<pony_1286> dragon soul is a joke
<Buytoast> if you aren't a troll, you've been playing the entire game incorrectly
<mentallyeffedguy> is anyone here from america or canada? if so, whats the time there?
<Sarah> Hi everyone! :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Ragnaros is hard with the staffquest
<Eli> i mean, finishing a raid is cool and stuff, but slashing a priest and a dk alone after your partner has been killed in arena... man THAT's a nice feeling
<mentallyeffedguy> hello Sarah
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The knock back gets annoyings
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *annoying
<Ninjazz> Uh oh. MMO topic.
*Ninjazz hides.
<AJIsAwesome> Sarah: Hi! :)
<Gold_Demona> mentallyeffedguy: Florida, est time zone
<Meanwhile> I can never unsee Raggies legs.
<mentallyeffedguy> Gold_Demona: whats the time?
<pony_1286> hello kitty island adventure
*Wirisme hides to since he can't join in
<Meanwhile> Sometimes when I close my eyes they're just...there.
<RaveBrony> I couldnt win arena to save my life! (Literally)
<Gold_Demona> mentallyeffedguy: 1:46pm
<Eli> Ninjazz: yeah, we can change topic. i stoped playing wow month ago :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have never done a heroic raid except ICC
<mentallyeffedguy> Gold_Demona: its time to get ill"
<Meanwhile> ICC was bloody pathetic as well.
<RaveBrony> MMOs!? So uh.... how about that.... uh... RuneScape!?!
<Ninjazz> Eli, tried a public server. Couldn't get into it.
<Ninjazz> private*
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I also never did a raid til Level 80
<mentallyeffedguy> movie night starts at 7pm there and 1 am here, annoying
<Ninjazz> RaveBrony, pfffff-yeah it was alright.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: burning crusade was awe4some
<Sarah> Has anypony played The House 2?
<Meanwhile> Aye, but Ulduar is still the best raid that ever came out.
<Wirisme> I shall stay up for it
<pony_1286> playing it atm sarah
<RaveBrony> Meanwhile: AMEN!! (\
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He feeds on your tears
<Meanwhile> RaveBrony: /)
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: oh god ulduar. "drools"
<RaveBrony> Best. Raid. Ever
<Meanwhile> Herald of the Titans is still my favourite title.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They freaking destroyed the Mimridon head mount drop
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: cause it just sounds awesome
<SpadeMagnes[School]> its now 1%
<RaveBrony> SpadeMagnes[School]: What was it before?
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: much better than "Kingslayer"
<SpadeMagnes[School]> 100%
<RaveBrony> :o
<Meanwhile> Aye, because now you can farm Yogg+0
<Meanwhile> With idiots no less.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well to be fair it would be too easy now
<RaveBrony> I like my 'Loremaster' title... but its not much...
<Aryd> probably 2 mannable in mists, itll cease to be rare soon
<Meanwhile> Back in my day we had to run five miles in Alterac Valley!
<Meanwhile> Uphill!
<alexxm> so anyone here watch community
<Meanwhile> In the snow!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Nothing is more hilarious then unintentionaly getting a Raid achivement
<Meanwhile> With empty bag space!
<RaveBrony> Ah the day when Alteric Valley lasted Hours! :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My guild got Ping Pong Champion by accident
<RaveBrony> *days
<Meanwhile> Last time I checked AV doesn't last five minutes.
<Aryd> and when it does, everyone whines
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: it lasts 5 minutes now?
<RaveBrony> Regradless of the patch, i still hate AB sooo much! :D
<RaveBrony> I never win it.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And we didnt have your fancy smancy LFR!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> We waited hours to make a group!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And we liked it!
<RaveBrony> ^
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music: Aviators - Home (Feat. Poni1Kenobi)
<Meanwhile> Stopped playing WoW months ago. Still has the same old problems.
<RaveBrony> I have officially stopped playing with MoP
<RaveBrony> :\
<Sarah> I'm playing The House 2... I'm in the bathroom...
<Dken2021> ah, talkingabout MMOs?
<RaveBrony> Yep yep
<Bronysith> the last MMO to really impress me and give me the "Morning already?" feeling was Rift
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Even though Deathwing has been defeated, they still havent repaired Stormwind
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Lazy workers
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Just because of your stupid totems
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Rift sucked
<Meanwhile> I've got nothing against pandas. Not in WoW anyway, irl they can all go die in a bamboo fire, but the game's just terribly cut down recently.
<pony_1286> i quit in the living room, fucking girl coming out of no where scared the crap out of me
<MadSurge> Sarah: an actually decent screamer game :D
<alexxm1> internet derped
<Meanwhile> I'm liking Guild Wars 2 so far.
<Meanwhile> Wish they'd kept in the class blender though.
<RaveBrony> the ONLY reason why i wanted MoP was to FINALLY murder Garrosh.... but :(
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: I heard of an in-game drinking contest :D
<pony_1286> gamon for warchief
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Not trying to sound like a purist but every MMO tries to be WoW these days
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh Algalon the raid destroyer..the memories
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *Alagon
<Meanwhile> I remember when Garrosh was just a whiny bitch in Nagrand.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I like Thrall
<Meanwhile> Now he's a whiny bitch with bigorexia and he's stolen Org.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: alliance or horde?
<Sarah> Anyone streaming?
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: Yes,.
<RaveBrony> Lol
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also for some reason Prince Varian has vanished from the throne room
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: and your fav class?
<Meanwhile> Rogue.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: spec?
<RaveBrony> Needs more Shaman
<Meanwhile> Every spec.
<RaveBrony> I wonder how nerfed Druids became...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Paladin Ftw
<Meanwhile> Bubblehearth and run away.
<Bronysith> i miss vanilla and burning crusade
<RaveBrony> Damn kitties kicking my arse in PvP
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You cant do that anymore
<SpadeMagnes[School]> they fixed that
<Meanwhile> They removed bubblehearth?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They shortend the time
<Meanwhile> Well you're practically useless now then.
<RaveBrony> :(
<Aryd> bubblehearth is back in
<pony_1286> most op class atm?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I kick ass with healing
<Bronysith> Warrior FTW
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I self outhealed a pvp Ice mage
<Bronysith> I was the only Warrior in my endgame guild. GOT ALL THE LOOT
<Aryd> itll be monk probably, if itlll be anything like wrath and dks
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I like I get 5 holy power now
<Meanwhile> Good grief when DK's first came out, the starting zone lag.
<pony_1286> i heard monk dps sucks though, but that their healing is really strong
<mentallyeffedguy> goodbye my brony friends, im off to be social! bye!
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<MaxTheBrony> You are social.
<MaxTheBrony> here.
<RaveBrony> Cya mentallyeffedguy
<mentallyeffedguy> MaxTheBrony: not the same
<MaxTheBrony> :(
<mentallyeffedguy> bye!
<MaxTheBrony> bye :(
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also I pray for the day Trade chat becomes decent
<Bronysith> AGHAHHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH
<Bronysith> ahahaha
<MaxTheBrony> still MoP as topic?
<Aryd> Never
<Bronysith> ahhhhhhhhhhh
<Meanwhile> Why don't you pray for the sky to turn into lemons while you're at it.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I know never gonna happen
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[School]: thats my favorite joke
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im sort of serious though
<Bronysith> BAHAHAHAH
<Sarah> Well, I need to go.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I want people be mature.. for once
<Meanwhile> I bet if I were to rekindle my subscription and log in right now I'd see the phrase "Anal [Dirge]"
<RaveBrony> Trade chat...decent... Heh
<BladedWings> afternoon everypony
<AJIsAwesome> Sarah: Bye! :)

<SpadeMagnes[School]> and gold sellers..
<RaveBrony> Wait.... did someoe say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]!?!?
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: HA
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<MaxTheBrony> Dem asian goldfarmers :)
<Meanwhile> I still have Thunderfury in my bags. Love that oversized lightning rod. <3
<RaveBrony> :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also the prices people sell mounts for are insane
<Bronysith> Giant Swords <3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> a crimson skellital horse for 14l
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *k
<pony_1286> did someone say [thunderfury, blessed blade of the windseeker]?
<RaveBrony> I never got Thunderfury.... I only have the left half :'(
<Kandarihu> I swear. These games that charge monthly fees. I'm surprised those are even still around.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sure the thing is a rare drop but still
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: how long did it take for you to get thunderfury?
<Meanwhile> FOREEEEVEEEEER.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Where Fluttershy Learned the Stare / Masterplan / Stuck
<Meanwhile> Like 2 fucking years.
*MaxTheBrony knows nothing about wow , but how it is as a game.
<magmablock> I'm assuming prince-dari is a bot
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I am a pack rat
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have Hakkar's heart in my bank
<SpadeMagnes[School]> and C'Thun's Eye
<SpadeMagnes[School]> and Hamon's head
<Kandarihu> I guess as long as there still are MMOs, there always be the P2P model.
<brony_90> hey there...
<Ninjazz> Dat lag.
<MaxTheBrony> heya brony_90
<Meanwhile> prince-dari is a cyborg.
<Dken2021> hai brony_90
<BladedWings> hi brony_90
<AJIsAwesome> brony_90: Hi!
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: for an in-game thing? :O That's one more thing to hate about MMOs :(
<Meanwhile> My Void storage and bank are mostly full of old armour sets.
<RaveBrony> Oh C'Thun.....What A Boss!! :D
<Meanwhile> C'Thun was fantastic.
<RaveBrony> All of the 'raid wipe' vids on youtube :D
<RaveBrony> from the first blast
<Meanwhile> Funny stuff.
*MaxTheBrony goes to his corner of ignorance and stupidity cause he doesnt know WoW stuff.
<RaveBrony> Im proud to say i was killed by that in Vanilla :')
<Aryd> bah, i joined late wrath. all i hear is how great wow 'was'.
<Amber> I'm back everypony! :)

<RaveBrony> Meanwhile: I thot they allowd you to fly...didnt know it was only slow fall...
<MLP_Brovakiin> RaveBrony: I just feel aweful for some reason, and I fell asleep an hour ago at my laptop.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You cant get Hakkar's heart anymore
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So I like it for the collectors value
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Void storage is stupid
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why would I want a a bank that makes me pay gold and removes all the enchantments
<SpadeMagnes[School]> RaveBrony: Want to know my first encounter with him?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> RaveBrony: Door opened and I died instantly to his eye laser
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Didnt even get in the room

<RaveBrony> I only have about 10k achieve points
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Meanwhile: Needs more 2s
<Meanwhile> Ikr.
<RaveBrony> Fel Reaver just about made me piss myself when i heard it :D
<Meanwhile> Fel Reaver was a bastard.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The Fel Bear was hilarious
<Amber> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNrXMOSkBas
<RaveBrony> Minding my own business and then "RAaawraawrawr" ded
<Meanwhile> Because you could never hear the git until he was in aggro raidus.

<MaxTheBrony> tf2
<killerpony7733> Sumica nope not on my side
<mitamaking> Reach for the sky
<PillowPoni> MadSurge: With what console?
<Kandarihu> It buffered for a pretty appropriate amount of time.
<BladedWings> guys, just i case...there is a storm goin on and i i leave (unless i say otherwise) its cause of that ^_^
<PillowPoni> Okay, much better. Just freezes for me some
<mentallyeffedguy> its buffering all the time, inpossibru to watch
<Ingwaz|Laptop> so, BladedWings, assume you died?
<Cavale> i see a play button
<Sumica> 00,10yeah I left it on pause till I could see if it was working
<Sumica> 00,10seems to be ok now
<PillowPoni> BladedWings: Them storms be fierce where you live
<Meanwhile> Looks fine to me.
<Ulthane> BladedWings must be hell of a storm
<Kandarihu> I'm not seeing the buffer circle, but it's pausing
<BladedWings> Ingwaz|Laptop: good enough
<MadSurge> PillowPoni: PC, XBox360 and PS3
<PillowPoni> Also, this song. I must havee
<mentallyeffedguy> Kandarihu: same here :/
<DaringDerpy> test
<PillowPoni> Ulthane: I live about 3 hours from BladedWings so I'll probably get it in about 3 hours
<Ingwaz|Laptop> BladedWings: where do you live BladedWings? in the path of tropical storm isaac?
<BladedWings> PillowPoni and Ulthane yea, its pretty bad
<mentallyeffedguy> stop pausing if you are pausing you son of a troll
<PillowPoni> MadSurge: l have a PC but it's out of commission at the moment
<BladedWings> Ingwaz|Laptop: idk...i thought issac was done with
<PillowPoni> BladedWings: Please don't say it has hail
<Kandarihu> Is Sumica pausing the video? Or is there still lag?
<BladedWings> PillowPoni: dont see any...let me check
<Ninjazz> Goal.
<mentallyeffedguy> i will for now on be more cute
<PillowPoni> BladedWings: Uh...you'll be able to hear it
<Kandarihu> Oh, I see. He's too busy dealing with the troll to be pausing the video.
<Ingwaz|Laptop> BladedWings: i heard on the radio that it might be coming back
<Sumica> 00,10you will be gone
<mentallyeffedguy> Sumica: im sorry, i will stop being an asshole. :)
<PillowPoni> BladedWings: You don't /have/ to go outside to check unless you want to be clonked in the head
<Sumica> 00,10and what ever this is must be on my end
<Buytoast> what's happening now?
<Kandarihu> Yeah, I think you're right
<PillowPoni> Sumica: There's not bad weather on your end, is it?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I am back folks
<Sumica> 00,10so time to fix some shit
<Ninjazz> Did I mention I love this? So much Rarity.
<Ninjazz> Awww.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back SpadeMagnes[School]
<Kandarihu> Well, thanks for streaming.
<Buytoast> But white horse is the worst horse
<mentallyeffedguy> sooooo....is the streaming done?
<BladedWings> PillowPoni: i didnt go outside...remember that big window in the living room...i went there
<PillowPoni> BladedWings: Oh yeah lol
<BladedWings> Ingwaz|Laptop: i didnt know that XD
<PillowPoni> BladedWings: Soo..no hail? What about thunder and lightning?
<PillowPoni> Cause it's sunny over here
<BladedWings> PillowPoni: hail no...thunder and lighting...tons of it ^_^
<ScottishUnicorn> It's nice and sunny in Cali
<PillowPoni> BladedWings: You might wanna get off your net now before the lightning hits a transformer and fucks with the neighborhood power
<mentallyeffedguy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckhtAcqTZEQ&feature=relmfu if anyone watches this, they will be mindfucked, the good way :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well I asked my dad if I could have a desktop instead of a laptop
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He said no but I managed to get him to think about it
<Meanwhile> PillowPoni: I got as far as the word "transformer" before I got distracted by thoughts of Megatron.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Balls to it I shall catch the movies at an earlier time tomorow, I am pooped. goodnight everyone :)
<BladedWings> i should be cool PillowPoni
<SpadeMagnes[School]> His reasoning for saying no is, "You can't move it"
<BladedWings> nite MLP_Brovakiin
<PillowPoni> Meanwhile: Wrong transformer but I give you an A for effort
<BladedWings> Meanwhile: lol
<Cavale> hmmm strems not working
<BladedWings> sumi is tryin to fix it Cavale
<Cavale> ahh kk
<PillowPoni> No stream? Link time?
<PillowPoni> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6MlaIe1ljs
<mentallyeffedguy> anyone wanna watch a retard take his tounge in a mouse trap?
<Ingwaz|Laptop> so everypony, grand opening today of a chinese restaurant, should i go there for some dinner?
<puffmuffins> yes
<BladedWings> why not
<Ninjazz> Oh boi.
<MirrorImage> well, that answers that question.
<PillowPoni> Ingwaz|Laptop: If you want to
<Shizuka> 13mentallyeffedguy: I suggest you familiarize yourself with our rules at http://www.bronystate.net/rules
<LabratoryPony> So anyone excited for Season 3 Premeire??
<Polydunami|MSPA> Sure, why not?
<BladedWings> LabratoryPony: duh
<MadSurge> Ingwaz|Laptop: if you like chinese, why not?
<Ingwaz|Laptop> LabratoryPony: DUH
<LabratoryPony> lol:)
<Ingwaz|Laptop> MadSurge: i LOVE chinese food
<MadSurge> Ingwaz|Laptop: then go for it!
<PillowPoni> Ingwaz|Laptop: I love the sweet and sour sauce
<Ingwaz|Laptop> particularly japanese style food, but i still like chinese quite a bit
<MirrorImage> Ingwaz|Laptop - that's why my last semester in college was great
<MirrorImage> moved in with some friends - chinese resturant TWO MINUTES AWAY
<Ingwaz|Laptop> PillowPoni: sweet and sour is okay, but i'm more partial to stir fried mixed veggies with a bit of meat in it, and some dumplings
<Sumica> 00,10ok, lets try this again shall we?
<BladedWings> i like General Tso Chicken
<Polydunami|MSPA> Refreshed my stream
<PillowPoni> Ingwaz|Laptop: I love the veggies. Especially the broccoli. God, I love brocolli
<MadSurge> PillowPoni: I hate it instead... all kinds of mixed flavours, I don't like them...
<BladedWings> back to mips
<Buytoast> did someone say they don't like chinese food?
<Buytoast> get out
<Polydunami|MSPA> Not me.
<alexxm> so tonight sould be a good movie night
<PillowPoni> MadSurge: To each their own, sir /)
<PillowPoni> alexxm: how so?
<Ingwaz|Laptop> PillowPoni: normally i hate brocolli, but i think thats just because its the way my family always cooked it. i like my veggies to be hot but still be nice and crisp
<Polydunami|MSPA> I enjoy chinese food. I once had Peking duck.
<Polydunami|MSPA> In Peking.
<Dken2021> not liking chinese food? that's a paddlin'
<Sumica> 00,10much better
<alexxm> PillowPoni jack niccholson as the joker is why
<Polydunami|MSPA> Yep <3
<PillowPoni> Ingwaz|Laptop: I prefer my brocolli to be steam or cooked. I tried it raw one time. Nope
<Eli> love my chao min
<Sumica> 00,10refresh for stream
<PillowPoni> alexxm: Whaaa? I've never seen that Batman. I've seen the campy 60s version
<Polydunami|MSPA> Nope. Don't recognize this video at all <_< >_>
<BladedWings> alexxm: awwww yeeeae
<Ingwaz|Laptop> PillowPoni: well, i didnt mean raw, i meant more like the way it comes when its steamed, rather than boiled.... blech
<Polydunami|MSPA> :3
<BladedWings> *yeeeea
<PillowPoni> alexxm: I love the campy 60s version
<Cassy> steamed veggies are more healthy than raw anyway
<Eli> Cassy: wut?
<PillowPoni> Ingwaz|Laptop: Aahh.
<Ingwaz|Laptop> PillowPoni: theres a little takeout chinese restaurant not too far from my university that i go to maybe once a week, while some of their meat dishes are good, the mixed vegetable lunch special is great
<Cassy> It was in a couple studies that the body has trouble breaking down purely raw vegetables so therefore got more vitamins from steamed
<MadSurge> PillowPoni: I quite agree, good sir/maam (\
<Eli> Cassy: they are healthyest raw with the peel, no?
<mentallyeffedguy> what Are those things?
<Polydunami|MSPA> Well, people don't chew their food thoroughly :|
<Cassy> I think it was due to the fact no human chews the required 57 times or whatnot
<PillowPoni> Ingwaz|Laptop: There's Chinese restaurants just about around every courner where I live
<Polydunami|MSPA> Yeah
<PillowPoni> MadSurge: /) ma'am. But you can call me miss.
<Kandarihu> Pinkie Drive!
<MirrorImage> *refreshes stream* HORRIBLE GRINDING NOIS- oh wait, that's A-Drive Smile
<BladedWings> a new chinese buffet opened where i'm at
<MadSurge> PillowPoni: okay miss PillowPoni :D
<PillowPoni> BladedWings: Where at?
<Ingwaz|Laptop> PillowPoni: well, theres 3 in this immediate area now, one is really not great, ones the little take out place and the new one is a new buffet
<Brad[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/bfpzJ.jpg what blasphemy.
<PillowPoni> MadSurge: Thank you, sir MadSurge :3
<BladedWings> PillowPoni: where the old Ryan's was
<MadSurge> What are these things in the stream called? :D
<MirrorImage> MadSurge - those are old Floppy Drives
<PillowPoni> Ingwaz|Laptop: Chinese food, survival for living in dorms
<MirrorImage> you know, A: drives?
<Eli> the frist thing i'll do when i arive in berlin on the 30. is walk around the corner at the trainstation, and go to that amazing chinese right next to it :)
<Ingwaz|Laptop> PillowPoni: theres a buffet with the same name on the other side of this town and i go there kind of regularly too, wide variety and usually good food so its quite popular
<Sumica> 00,10what's an A drive
<PillowPoni> BladedWings: Oh yeah, I know where that is. They should have put a fucking Golden Corral or something that'll make money there
<Polydunami|MSPA> A: is the floppy disk drive
<Ingwaz|Laptop> Sumica: maybe a flash drive? or one of your cd drives?
<Cassy> mmm golden corral
<Sumica> 00,10Not a fan of the song but it's good editing
<Kandarihu> Come Every Dri-ive, LOAD LOAD LOAD! Fill my buffer up with DA-TA DA-TA!
<PillowPoni> Ingwaz|Laptop: If it's a popular place, go to it.
<Ingwaz|Laptop> ahh, that answers that
<mentallyeffedguy> bye everyone!!!
<Shizuka> 13A: is just the label typically assigned to the floppy disk drive, on account of it generally being the first available drive to boot from on early systems
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sup
<Polydunami|MSPA> See you, mentallyeffedguy
<BladedWings> PillowPoni: true, but we got what we got and will make the best of it...until it closes :D
<PillowPoni> BladedWings: Yeah....
<Shizuka> 13a 3.5" drive for A, a 5.25" drive for B, and hard disk was C
<Kandarihu> Sumica, you're still lagging on me.
<MirrorImage> yeah, you know you're old if you still refer to B drive for the 5.25" drive
<Cassy> I used to use 5.25 disks
<MirrorImage> and by old, i mean 20
<Polydunami|MSPA> Yeah, I've gotten buffer and lag on my end.
<Cassy> I actually, predate 5.25's
<PillowPoni> ^^
<Amber> :)
<Kandarihu> Well, it seems that B: is STILL reserved for 5.25 discs.
<Shizuka> 13every program ever started assuming C is the hard drive, so it's stuck since
<Cassy> I'm from the audio tape era
<Sumica> 00,10well it's gone on my end
<Shizuka> 13and i'm pretty sure A and B are reserved in windows for floppy controllers still
<Polydunami|MSPA> You mean cassettes, Cassy?
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - no, i believe you can assign anything to them at this point
<Cassy> aye
<BladedWings> i got little freezes here and there but its cool
<Polydunami|MSPA> Because I remember those as well.
<MirrorImage> let me go check, i'm pretty sure i could assign an HD partition to A or B if i wanted
<Eli> Cassy: don't even have to be that old to be from that era
<Shizuka> 13might have changed
<Polydunami|MSPA> But eight-tracks are before my time.
<Shizuka> 13i recall trying to set to A or B once and couldn't for either
<PillowPoni|Shower> Gonna take a shower, brb
<Brad[Laptop]> MirrorImage I think you can.
<Sumica> 00,10not sure what else I can do othere then stop all together
<Eli> but kids nowadays... so ignorant of the culture of datatransmition
<Shizuka> 13F and up is usually the best range for mapping since it's unlikely any drive windows brings in will need a letter that far up
<Meanwhile> It's been fine for me Sumica, I blame everyone else.
<BladedWings> yeeeeees, DIO!
<MirrorImage> yep, i could assign A or B to my partitions
<Cassy> And just to be clear, I'm referring to cassettes being for computer software
<Flyboy> AH! damn it headphones
<MadSurge> :O YES RAINBOW IN THE DARK
<BladedWings> \m/
<Sumica> 00,10I had to exit steam and restart system
<Sumica> 00,10the new comunity shit is laggy
<Shizuka> 13it's mostly the steam browser
<Kandarihu> My mom's laptop came with Windows 7 pre-loaded. The main HDD is C, with special partitions for D: and F:. I think the DVD-ROM is E:.
<MadSurge> NO SIGNS OF THE MORNING COMING, YOU WERE LEFT ON YOUR OWN... LIKE A RAINBOW IN THE DARK
<Kandarihu> Funny how both my old computer and my mom's laptop BOTH label my external HDD as I:
<Shizuka> 13yeah windows almost always sets the main partition to C, with D for secondary partition or optical drive
<MirrorImage> yeah, but i haven't seen a program in ages that actually assumes the D: was CD
<BladedWings> love singing this on Rock Band
<MirrorImage> and that's even back when A and B were actually used for disk drives
<Shizuka> 13incoming drives store their label on the filesystem, so long as the host doesn't already have something mapped there, it happily takes on the letter supplied by the incoming drive
<MadSurge> Metal + ponies: AWESOME
*Sumica still has a tape drive
<BladedWings> MadSurge: so true MadSurge
<BladedWings> oops dat double ping
<Sumica> 00,10mostly cause the screws that hold it in place the heads are broken off of
<Shizuka> 13:O
<Shizuka> 13YES
<Shizuka> 13YES YES YES
<Kandarihu> I see. So if I were to build a new computer, and install Windows 7 on it, my External HDD would claim I: there as well?
<Shizuka> 13IT'S BACK
<Sumica> 00,10what is Shizuka?
<MirrorImage> Kandarihu - if D, E, F, G, and H were all used, yes probably
<Shizuka> 13http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/09/pong-gets-a-physics-boost-by-way-of-html5/ plasma pong's developer is finally out of hiding
<Polydunami|MSPA> Yeah, all I know about cassettes are the ones that played music.
<Sumica> 00,10ahh
<MadSurge> Shizuka: Oh that game in your outro! :D
<MirrorImage> i've got a rather wonky drive layout on my computer...
<Shizuka> 13or the latest version of it
<MirrorImage> C, D, and Z are all partitions of the same harddrive
<BladedWings> awww
<Shizuka> 13the plasma pong i have was the last version before the C&D in 2008 or so
<MirrorImage> E is the actual CD Drive, F is the Daemon Tools CD drive
<Shizuka> 13MirrorImage: L O and T are partitions on my external
<MirrorImage> and G, H, I, and J are all reserved for my card readers
<Shizuka> 13hate card readers.... sucks up so many drives..
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - yeah, but I needed the SD card reader
<MirrorImage> or else i'd actually have to shell out for an MP3 player, rather than using my cell phone
<Sumica> 00,10I even have a P: drive
<Polydunami|MSPA> *specifically
<MirrorImage> and besides, it was $20 on a $2200 system
<MirrorImage> when you get that high up on price, it's really a case of "why not" instead of "why should i?"
<Amber> My teachers did a flash mob to this on the last day of school
<Polydunami|MSPA> Right. I'll be busy with something else.
<RaveBrony> Shooot, had to leave for a bit. What have i missed?
<BladedWings> PMVs
<MirrorImage> RaveBrony - drive letter discussion
<Cassy> My brothers first hard drive was 20mb in size and was over a foot wide
<RaveBrony> MirrorImage: Ah.
<ArcherJoe11> Hey Everypony
<Kandarihu> It's getting hard to remember how my old computer's partitions came about. Let's see. A: for the internal Floppy, C: for main HDD, D: for DVD-ROM, E: for CD-Burner, F: for my 2nd internal HDD, G: when I repartitioned my C Drive to make it a Dual-Boot Linux. H: for a USB Drive I bought.
<BladedWings> hi ArcherJoe11
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: A Message from Rarity

<Lyra`> Sumica, i have an idea, youre going to have to go with me on this, but just follow my lead and we'll make it through.
<Meanwhile> The theory is that knowledge exists in the genes they're being replicated from.
<LunarRepublicGuard> this has to be doctor who right?
*Lyra` hugs Sumica

<Fl00tersh41> Meanwhile: If that's the case, why do babies have to spend so long learning to talk?
<CrimsonPhoenix> now that's interesting
<Fl00tersh41> Shouldn't it be in their genes?
<CK|GW2> welp
<CK|GW2> ded

<LunarRepublicGuard> HA!
<Jesus> Cassandra released the zombies
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Massive shaft
<MadSurge> Can she go any higher with that pitch?
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: and broke her spine
<LewaBolt> The cats made human clones to get cures for all the didises
<RAWRity> Dark_Horst: and shattered her kneecaps
<Fl00tersh41> The cats could just have conducted their research somewhere that isn't within spitting distance of interlopers
<CrimsonPhoenix> This is huge what the fuck
<Meanwhile> Chavtastic.

<magmablock> Wow, it's been almost an entire year since the debut of season 2. Hard to believe it's been that long already
<Sonny> is it normal that this isn't a stream :o?
<Ninjazz> :<
<Polydunami|PS> This God? Absolutely nothing.

<derpyface> according to a article i read that my little pony promotes satan
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Nah, we're getting set up

<Michael> http://derpy.me/Zrmls
<Wirisme> Good job they came to a 5 hour movie night then
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: reward? what? That's not how business works. You want more money, you've gotta be lucky, have the right sound, and be in the right place at the right time to get a hit. And even then it's rare as hell.
<Barbetos|AtWork> cowvarkian: nah. I can pay attention to boring, but it does not mean I want too.

<Kammerjunk> Books exist, I tell you!
<Darf14> lol
<Silverscreen> 01,11One thing I *didn't* like about the old batman movies: Gotham just looked stupid. It was too over-the-top and exxagerated.
<Aircrafter> IXAT.
<Crippler> And to this day, batman has an irrational hatred of cab drivers.
<Everlasting_Joy> cowvarkian: actually, that would be awesome.

<oni_link> cowvarkian: IKR
<Bronysith> inb4 BANGITY BANG BANG
<RosePetal> Seems legit.
<The_Bookworm> Sneaks: It just began
<Meanwhile> And will likely be only the talk of historical fact.
<Midnight_Fyre> The thing about Tim Burton is, with the exception of this, when he is doing something original it usually turns out pretty good, and when he is basing a movie off of something else it's usually, well, not
<Sumica> 00,10this is over the top?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Inb4 ded
<Whiskra> that was what made Gotham... GOTHAM

<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Is it really Lando?
<habrdsh> WHY SO SERIOUSA
<Kammerjunk> I'm Kevin Bacon.
<Silverscreen> 01,11Dent is black. Your argument is invalid.

<cowvarkian> LANDO CALRISSIAN FOR MAYOR
<Eli> woaah hold on a sec! that's harvey??
<RosePetal> Actually Harvey Dent was supposed to be Two Face that is until Joel turned him down and picked Tommy Lee jones.
<Buytoast> white race, black race, one face, two face
<MLP_Brovakiin> Harvey dent is a black man
<MrBen> Harvery Calrissian.
<Twerlet_Spaykle> When did Harvey become Black?
<Darf14> Lando is the bst mayor, he fought ghost you know
<String_Shredder> Lando Dent
<Clayface> "I'm aman of few words. ...Good night."
<DashWithRainbows> This guy looks like the guy from the C&C 3 campaign, Director Boyle I think.

<desertman2> no
<SirGanjalf> Heeere's Jackie
<otakon> hmmmm
<shogipony> harley quinn
<Bronysith> JOKER
<RosePetal> No, it's the one with the Joker.
<Darf14> nope its the joker habrdsh
<otakon> what measurement?
<Bronysith> JOKER JOKER JOKER
<MrBen> Tomplchan: What? No Mark Hamill?
<RAWRity> though really, A sack of heated shit>>>>>>>clooney
<MASF123|> Ugh...get to the Rainbows! D:
<otakon> also, who's is the better Joker?
<Kandarihu> oni_link, yeah
<habrdsh> Mark hamill is a legend
<Twerlet_Spaykle> this one
<MrBen> The guy who voiced the Joker in the animated versions?
<CrimsonPhoenix> shogipony, Harley is nowhere in there
<RAWRity> otakon: definitely Ledger
<DashWithRainbows> Shizuka It's mostly the voice that makes it seem like the guy I'm talking about. Lemme just go check google.
<Bronysith> MARK HAMILL IS BEST JOKER
<Eli> Jack Nicholson is god's best friend
<Silverscreen> 01,11Jack Nicholson was a good joker. Perfect for Burton's version of the character.
<AlienWarhead> Tomlpchan Mark Hamil had an good career in voice acting
<Bloxx> All work and no play makes batman a dull boy
<Twerlet_Spaykle> agreed
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> dat Jackie *remembers Anger Management* 0_o oh god he sleeps in the NUDE lol
<RosePetal> Mark Hammil is good and so is Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson. They are all very good jokers.
<Sumica> 00,10defenatly Silverscreen
<DocSane> Mark Hamill turned out to be a better voice actor than live actor.
<fluttercry> 05,15DashWithRainbows yes. that's him. he's also Lando from Star Wars
<Ryunosuke> Jack Nicholson is 2nd best joker
<habrdsh> You look fab
<otakon> Actually I could have SWORN that NC did a New VS. Old for the Batman movies
<SirGanjalf> Oh, wait, he's not Joker yet.
<OohShiny> ouch
<RAWRity> This guy's good, but Ledger was another level.
<ObLiCody> what are we watching today
<OohShiny> That gotta burn
<MASF123|> I think he's best Joker.
<DashWithRainbows> Ah, cheers fluttercry.
<RosePetal> Dat tie.
<Wirisme> BURN
<Bronysith> ledger was just insane
<Bloxx> Damn. He's. COOL.
<Thrackerzod> whats this?

<Ninjazz> Gnight, regs.
<RosePetal> Batman.

<Bronysith> night Ninjazz
<otakon> night Ninjazz
<AlienWarhead> oblicody 1989 Batman
<Deadlypon3> "Ooaah wwoahahah"
<Thrackerzod> BATMAN
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Yeah he did a great job, but you know, Ledgers gonna Ledge.
<fluttercry> 05,15Ledger made him seem real. Nicholson plays him like a comic book
<otakon> BULLOCK!
<spitfirecolt> lol
<shogipony> no i mean that looks like harley quinn
<fluttercry> 05,15Both are great in their own way
<RosePetal> It's Commisor Gordon!
<Tomlpchan> MrBen: I think Harrisson ford is still the only one who "survived" as an actor in the long term, at least he's the one who'll be remembered
<Michael> where's gordon?
<Ryunosuke> just keep watching, kinda hard to miss what it is
<otakon> fluttercry: oh a COMICBOOK?!
<Ryunosuke> :)
<Kandarihu> Actually, I wish the media could be like it is in every fiction where the media doesn't play a role.
<AJIsAwesome> DashWithRainbows: Are you able to change the color of your text?

<Bronysith> in shrinkwrap
<otakon> Meanwhile: not bullocks
<DSNesmith> boo
<pikoBat> That Knox guy sounds like Bill Murray.
<Michael> the bat is a lie
<OohShiny> giant bat? didn't look like that

<Bat_Quick_Thinker> a giant bat banna
<Darf14> Bats.... or Aliens
<Bloxx> Only one option, we gotta nuke the bats
<RosePetal> Giant Bat.
<RAWRity> Batman 1989 = Comic book brought to Film. Batman Returns = Tim Burton movie in Batman Drag
<Wirisme> wahwahwah
<Aircrafter> I'm telling you man. It was a giant Zubat.
<Bronysith> so much money it was worth
<twilight_sprinkle> banana peelz are dangerous man
<Amber> Giant Bat!
<OohShiny> AlienWarhead: Luna
<SirGanjalf> I gotta say: Joker character have one of the best impersonators
<DIZZYRATCHET> that bat is a spy
<MASF123|> Is this around the time Batman started....in this time period I mean.
<RosePetal> lol .
<Crippler> ohhhh
<Midnight_Fyre> When you really think about it though, Nicholson's Joker is by far the greater villain. He kills thousands of people for shits and giggles
<Rosfox> pwned
<otakon> Meanwhile: Bullock, he was a detective in the comies.
<Buytoast> no
<Amber> :D
<Nicos> cant argue with that

<Deadlypon3> HArveh Dent?

<RosePetal> Harvvvvey Dent.
<Amber> Are those ponies on the botton of the screen?
<Darf14> Back when everyone must wear a hat
<BrOnyxia> im buttman
<mitamaking> Dent's in this movie
<DSNesmith> that's right
<Ryunosuke> its 1) Mark Hammil, 2) Jack Nicholson, 3) Heath Ledger :)
<RosePetal> Eyeup.
<Deadlypon3> No offense, but I HATE Joker as some sort of former mafia asshole
<Michael> that is not harvey dent
<DSNesmith> let's insult the crazy guy

<Ghosties> 04OKAY
<Deadlypon3> Joker is a crazy phycho who doesn't care about moneh
<Kandarihu> We can just call him Jack N.
<grayhoof> that laugh
<Twerlet_Spaykle> So when does he become Joker?
<Ghosties> 04Now, maybe that'll work
<otakon> Ghosties: what's up oh temporal one?
<Silverscreen> 01,11mitamaking: you put ledger behind Romero...?
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties Discord is best joker :p
<Kammerjunk> I'm thinking 20-30 minutes.
<Amber> Aw, Rainbow Dash looks cute with her wings out! :)
<DocSane> Problem with Nicholson is that he's just playing the usual Jack Nicholson character.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> mitamaking: Awwhhhh sheeeeeet
<Midnight_Fyre> Twerlet_Sperkle: later
<mitamaking> I love Romero
<ROHKARA> Bob; the greatest henchman of all time
<RAWRity> this Joker is a much more "dangerous" villain, but Ledger's was more inruiging. he wasn't interested in destroying Gotham so much as he was making it destroy itself, all while fucking with batman's psyche.
<AlienWarhead> Batman appeared in 1939
<MLP_Brovakiin> Yay hotdogs
<Wirisme> I'm fine with that
<Buytoast> who was romero?
<mitamaking> There is Harvey suave Dent
<MrBen> Haha. Ceasar Romero.
<RosePetal> It's my party!
<Bronysith> LANDO ?!
<Randomnerd> Ehrmahgehrd, Twerlet_Spaykle
<pikoBat> Gotham City looks scary. ;_;
<Ghosties> 04Dude, isn't that...what's his name
<DSNesmith> TDK was the only movie I've seen twice in theaters
<DSNesmith> mainly for ledger
<Deadlypon3> ....Man...Lando stop being SEXY
<MrBen> Buytoast: Romero played the Joker in the 60s live action version
<SirGanjalf> So Gotham is 223 years old, huh?
<OohShiny> hire Pinkie Pie to plan your party
<fluttercry> 05,15Ledger and Nicholson are both fantastic. Nicholson plays him like a comic character, and Ledger plays him as a real psychopath
<Buytoast> oh
<RosePetal> That's what Gotham City is supposed to be.
<Ghosties> 04Damn...Carl Winslow?
<Buytoast> that one
<DSNesmith> TDKR was... okay
<AlienWarhead> 1 batman ha ha ha
<fluttercry> 05,15I don't think you can really compare them
<Ryunosuke> Ghosties, I am sure he has a name
<Buytoast> whimsical as all hell
<Kammerjunk> Didn't watch.
<habrdsh> pikoBat: you should see Arkham City
<Darf14> Theres always appropriate for a party even when there in debt, Pinkie taught them well
<Pinkie123> Hi, everypony!
<The_Bookworm> Ghosties: Billy Dee Williams
<DocSane> Bob Kane
<Michael> dat art
<Ghosties> 04That's it

<mitamaking> Man Billy Dee would have been good as Two Face
<Ghosties> 04Thanks
<RaveBrony> Lol
<Wirisme> dat realism
<Optical> batman...literally
<RAWRity> I personally thought TDKR was better.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> BAT LAWYER
<oni_link> That awkward moment when you walk by the batroom door and your oldest brother is singing Everlong O,O
<Kandarihu> Jack N. can be shorthand for both the actor (Jack Nichalson) and the character (Jack Napier)
<Kammerjunk> Hear it's good.
<RosePetal> Dem legs.
<Deadlypon3> fluttercry Discord is best joker, DUH
<Randomnerd> Bob Kane is the creator of Batman.
<AlienWarhead> OH MAI
<Michael> ohai Pinkie123

<MrBen> Buytoast: Yeah, the guy who refused to shave his mustache for the role
<Ryunosuke> hellooo nurse
<Silverscreen> 01,11nonono, that was ManBat
<The_Bookworm> Ghosties: And Lando is Harvey Dent. Also, you're welcome
<otakon> ah legs
<Bloxx> That bat will probably become another one of Burton's characters
<SirGanjalf> dayum
<mitamaking> That's Manbat not Batman
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hamill is the true joker in my heart
<DSNesmith> I just felt like TDKR could have been great, but settled for merely good
<otakon> LEGS LEGS LEGS
<Buytoast> yeah, now i know the guy
<Deadlypon3> sliverscreen sumerpan :D?
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: he does the best voice
<Ghosties> 04I was away for a moment, which one is Harvy?
<Spazturtle> lol

<Everlasting_Joy> Lilly Lilly legs Lilly!
<Meanwhile> Ghosties: Lando
<Midnight_Fyre> I actually have not seen TDKR yet. Just been so busy lately
<RosePetal> It's Vicki.
<DocSane> I think Hamill's Joker is the very best one.
<DSNesmith> for one thing it pulled a complete 180 on the themes of the last two movies
<The_Bookworm> Ghosties: Lando
<RAWRity> I honestly don't get that.
<otakon> Ghosties: Billy Dee Williams

<cowvarkian> Ghosties: lando
<FlootarShay> Randomnerd Ermahgerd
<twilight_sprinkle> she could get hurt reading a magazine? life is wild

<DSNesmith> well
<RosePetal> No, stay away from Gotham City because usually you end up as a hostage or a villian.
<DSNesmith> before we start
<AJIsAwesome> Wow, 255 people here......:O
<cowvarkian> yes! Ghosties
<DSNesmith> anyone afraid of spoilers?
<otakon> Ghosties: he's black in the animated show too
<The_Bookworm> Ghosties: Yes. Yes he is
<mitamaking> Harvey is arguably black in TAS
<Tomlpchan> He's Harvuy Dent
<AlienWarhead> Is Sumerman best friend Bamtan?
<Silverscreen> 01,11Though Hamil and Ledger, IMO, are on the same level.
<Midnight_Fyre> yes
<Wirisme> dat significant number
<Randomnerd> Gersbuermps
<fluttercry> 05,15NO SPOILRES
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> damn buffer
<Kandarihu> Ghosties, eeyup.
<rabidsonic220> wait...catwomens in the seconed one, batman returns, right?
<Meanwhile> Nope.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Wasn't Harvey Dent black (well, part black) in one of the cartoons too?
<FlootarShay> no
<Joy> Hello everypony!
<Ghosties> 04Huh
<Bronysith> spoil and die a worse death
<Darf14> lol
<The_Bookworm> Nope.avi
<otakon> Ghosties: not sure if in the original comics
<RosePetal> Yes.
<AlienWarhead> Hi Joy
<otakon> DERPDERPDERPDERP: THE cartoon
<MrBen> As far as the animated Joker is concerned, I think Hamill did the best portrayal. As far as live-action is concerned, I feel Ledger had the stronger performance.
<fluttercry> 05,15tis an insta ban.
<AJIsAwesome> Joy: Hi! :)
<Optical> hello Joy
<DSNesmith> okay, then I'll limit it to the plot of TDKR was too similar to BB for me
<Crippler> dat scale model
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: Ain't we just awesome
<MASF123|> I like Mark Hamil MUCH more than Heth Ledger.
<Michael> ohai Joy
<Kandarihu> Harvey Dent is white in TAS
<otakon> DERPDERPDERPDERP: one of the goddamn BEST cartoons EVER
<FlootarShay> spoiler alert, something is going to happen\
<oni_link> what the heck does NICETAS mean?
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Joy!
<otakon> HIYA CURLY!
<habrdsh> AJIsAwesome: There was 5000+ during canterlot wedding
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: Yep. :)
<Benickerson> Hi Joy :D
<Meanwhile> no spoilers in officially sanctioned chatrooms.
<Midnight_Fyre> i'll go to mainchat for a while
<Deadlypon3> Silverscreen Hamill played him as what we would WANT from the joker; Ledger plays him as he would actually BE
<Aircrafter> Jabby Jabby.
<AlienWarhead> otakon6_9
<OohShiny> there are children watching, watchyamouth.
<AJIsAwesome> habrdsh: WHAT?! :O
<RAWRity> Sure, TDKR's plot was based partially on Knightfall, but no more than TDK was based on The Killing Jok
<RosePetal> Dem cards.
<Kammerjunk> This Bruce fellow seems like an interesting guy. He probably isn't very important in the film, though.
<Michael> dat suit
<Wirisme> what he said
<Bloxx> Jack Nicholson swag
<cowvarkian> well fuck, OohShiny
<habrdsh> AJIsAwesome: Yep everyone tuned in
<RosePetal> Who me?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> otakon: I used to love it too, I didn't remember him being black in that one though. Guess so.
<mitamaking> Jack is a great joker too, I just hate how the character is written
<Wirisme> It's a trap!
<Ryunosuke> That foreshadowing
<Michael> dem purple suit
<OohShiny> sup Joker
<CrimsonPhoenix> FORESHADOWING
<SirGanjalf> dat card
<RosePetal> Foreshadowing!
<AJIsAwesome> habrdsh: That's amazing. :O
<Darf14> hello foreshadowing
<XylemTube> lol joker
<DIZZYRATCHET> Thugs-4-less order now
<twilight_sprinkle> Oola
<MrBen> lawlz
<Tomlpchan> Jack nicholson makes evrything better. You don't put Jack nicholson in a movie, you make a movie around Jack Nicholson's character
<habrdsh> Foreshadowing Harley Quine
<Joy> :)
<Kammerjunk> Okay, I said 20-30 minutes, but no. I'm thinking he goes Joker in 10-20.
<XylemTube> he's even got the purple suit on
<oni_link> This movie was the Kittys Titties growing up
<RosePetal> Dat tie.
<Deadlypon3> "POUT"
<Deadlypon3> Dat POUT
<MASF123|> So The Joker isn't the Joker yet?
<MrBen> And I suppose the woman was Harley Quinn.
<Shadow_Dash454> :D
<Bronysith> fucking hell
<Meanwhile> Funny, I don't think I've ever actually seen this movie.
<SirGanjalf> MASF123|: yep
<CrimsonPhoenix> MrBen, no
<habrdsh> Y SO SEWIOUS
<Ihop> i give it 5
<mitamaking> I hate Joker having a name too
<OohShiny> dead old guy
<RosePetal> He's not the Joker yet.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Tomlpchan: Jack Nicholson plays Jack Nicholson, you work in the other characters later.
<Silverscreen> 01,11Hamil was legendary as Joker's voice actor, but I think Ledger should get a bit more credit for bringing the character to life on a whole new level.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Harley was a psychiatrist
<pikoBat> Aw man, I love the Kidder, he's my favorite mean dude.3
<MrBen> Crimson: Didn't think so. :)
<AlienWarhead> habrdsh This movie predates Harley Quine
<Wirisme> You.... are my number one.... GUY
<shogipony> as i said before
<Deadlypon3> MrBen Harley Quinn is from the animted series, So...no
<Ryunosuke> folks
<OohShiny> ded old guy
<Kammerjunk> Creepy fellow, that one.
<Bronysith> if they make a FFVI movie, they need Mark Hamill to voice Kefka...it would be animated of course
<MrBen> Deadlypon3: Didn't think so. xD
<Ryunosuke> Harrly wasnt introduced till the 90's
<DocSane> Oh, Jack Palance... King of the breathy delivery.
<flutter_spin> def Silverscreen
<SirGanjalf> I forgot: What's the Joker real name in this movie?
<MrBen> Lucky deck
<DocSane> Belive it...OR NOT!
<RosePetal> Jack Napier.
<mitamaking> I think Ledger overdid it, I prefered Eckhart in it
<Wirisme> Jack Napier
<fluttercry> 05,15Remember the guy line...
<SirGanjalf> *Joker's
<pony_300> there's something about the atmosphere alone that makes this movie feel so iconic
<Meanwhile> Huh. I've got a lucky deck too.
<twilight_sprinkle> dem smiling exchanges
<habrdsh> ALienWarhead: WHen was Harley first introduced
<FlootarShay> Bigger Bad?
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: ifyouknowwhatimean.jpg
<SirGanjalf> tnanks Wirisme
<Buytoast> in the animated series
<MrBen> "And not for the better!"
<Buytoast> i beleive
<SirGanjalf> *thanks
<Silverscreen> 01,11mitamaking: Overdoing it is the whole point in the joker. He's over the top fromt he word go.
<Kammerjunk> It may be lucky, but he sure ain't playing with a full deck.
<SirGanjalf> and Rose Petal:)
<RosePetal> Dat castle.
<Meanwhile> No really, cards. I shuffle them to stop my hands being idle.
<mitamaking> Speaking of Exkhart...
<CreativePonyName> iv never seen this movie they say the old batman movies suck
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> damn internet derped on me
<Ryunosuke> habrdsh, iirc harly was introduced with TAS
<Michael> wayne mansion?
<mitamaking> *Eckhart
<AlienWarhead> habrdsh Batman the animated series she got into the comic later
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Not gonna lie, I always liked Mad Hatter and Ventriloquist. Guilty pleasures?
<Bronysith> we need to find yugi moto, and we gonna take his deck
<CreativePonyName> tis looks good thoigh
<cowvarkian> CreativePonyName: who are they
<oni_link> Buytoast: you belive what?
<Deadlypon3> Silverscreen the whole point of Joker? To just mess with the batman
<mitamaking> Well Ledger killed himself doing it
<Everlasting_Joy> I say!
<Buytoast> Harley Quinn was introduced in the animated series
<DocSane> One other thing I like about this movie: Batman is portrayed as an otaku.
<Bronysith> "is he saying deck or dick?"
<Kandarihu> AlienWarhead, you RC.
<CrimsonPhoenix> DERPDERPDERPDERP, you have your villain preferences
<Buytoast> unless i'm mistaken
<RaveBrony> Well, im gonna go get some pizza, bbs
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Alfred!
<flutter_spin> CreativePonyName: The original "Batman" is an awesome classic. Every movie after it sort of went downhill (even though they are still entertaining)
<Ryunosuke> At the Gala, At the Gala
<Bronysith> "Its best not to ask"
<CrimsonPhoenix> DERPDERPDERPDERP, personally I prefer the Riddler
<Michael> ^^
<fluttercry> 05,15CreativePonyName only Batman and Robin was bad.
<Darf14> Hmm this party needs baloons
<RosePetal> It's Alfred.
<Ryunosuke> troll
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> R.I.P Alfred
<MrBen> Mr. Freeze was probably one of the more interesting villians in my opinion, if only for the tragic background of the character.
<habrdsh> Such a CLassy party
<DocSane> He's this reclusive guy who sits in front of computers all day and doesn't like interacting with people directly
<AlienWarhead> Kandarihu RC?
<Deadlypon3> Fluttercry BATMAN AND ROBIN SHALL NOT BE NAMED
<CreativePonyName> fluttercry: oh
<Buytoast> you want to see a bad Batman movie, go see Batman and Robin
<Silverscreen> 01,11mitamaking: wait, so you're saying it's a BAD THING that he was so commited to giving the character the treatment he deserves?
<SirGanjalf> Yeah, Eckhart's tas wasn't difficult...
<twilight_sprinkle> DERPDERPDERPDERP: i love your name
<SirGanjalf> *task
<Buytoast> that movie was so bad it's entertaining
<flutter_spin> lol Deadlypon3
<Ghosties> 04If we ever show Batman and Robin I'm totally being Freeze
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: Personally, I prefer the air! huehuehue

<OohShiny> sup Bruce
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> hehehe
<Joy> :)
<RosePetal> BRUCE WAYNE.
<Wirisme> trolololol
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties FREEZE WELL, GHOSTIES
<Kandarihu> flutter_spin, I hear nothing but good things about the Dark Knight trilogy (leftist whining about the last movie aside)
<OohShiny> troll Bruce is trool
<MrBen> Though the Governator did a pretty...odd job, if hamfisted, way of portraying him in the live action movie.
<Everlasting_Joy> Ghosties: "Cool" story bro!
<Tomlpchan> flutter_spin: I don't know, they're still decent for their time, I just think times change, and movies change with them, don't they?
<pony_300> creativepony: Everything after Batman Returns, yea. I personally don't include the adam west Batman movie though, because it's an acquired tastes from that era
<Silverscreen> 01,11trololol
<shogipony> harley quinn rocks
<oni_link> Ghosties is best Freeze
<DocSane> Keaton was such a weird chocie to play Batman, but it worked somehow
<CreativePonyName> is catwoman in this?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> CrimsonPhoenix: Well, I did mean as far as minor villains go. I always loved Batman's villains, they're all very... interesting.
<Ghosties> 04Aaaaand the puns begin
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, and yet you use a landmaster....GENIUS
<Michael> ohai ba... bruce
<AJIsAwesome> Hey, Ghosties? Do you now what killed the dinosaurs? DEE ICE AGE!

<flutter_spin> Phase4: Original "Batman" just started
<Bronysith> nothing can stop otakon s wrath
*Canadian_Brony was frozen today
<alexxm> bob
<Kammerjunk> Also, one of those flying bugs with long legs just flew into my face, and now I can't stop laughing for some reason.
<oni_link> Late 90s batman
<RosePetal> lol FREEZE!
<Whiskra> adam west is incredibly overrated
<Bjornfot> >:3
<OohShiny> good old acting
<Darf14> Chill out
<pikoBat> If this were any other movie, there would have been a dozen explosions by nowl.
<Sonny> love the yay thingy :)
<SirGanjalf> I quickly got used too Bale's "cancer" voice, so it don't annoy me that much. But I agree they could make him sound more... subtle?
<Deadlypon3> Silverscreen I REALLY liked the batman begins voice with Bale did; it was subtle but didn't give away his real identity
<somepony_else> ikr Phase4... no adam west... :(
<Silverscreen> 01,11Deadlypon3: He was a threat. He had to act like a threat.
<FlootarShay> Bronysith there is one thing
<DIZZYRATCHET> dem effects:D
<Meanwhile> otakon lags too much to be used effectively.
<RosePetal> That's Gordon.
<mitamaking> Whiskra: No.... he is.... not
<Phase4> 00,02fluttercry, Exactly, where is the batsprays
<Darf14> yay Gordon
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Whiskra: You misspelled awesome.
<AlienWarhead> Whiskra he is funny though
<Ghosties> 04"Taken alive, see?"
<fluttercry> 05,15THAT IS NOT COMISSIONER GORDON
<otakon> oh har har
<pikoBat> GRODON FREEDMEN!
*Bjornfot nomz otakon
<Buytoast> man, gordon looks chubby as all hell
<cowvarkian> anti shark spray
<Ghosties> 04THAT IS NOT SOLID SNAKE!
<flutter_spin> fluttercry: totally.
<Deadlypon3> Silverscreen "I"M NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS"
*FlootarShay licks and noms otakon repeatedly
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: I once knew a guy who ate those as a party trick.
<Clayface> Yeah, Oldman was a much better Gordon. This guy looks like Teddy Roosevelt
<DIZZYRATCHET> alive
<Sumica> 00,10the voice buged me in bales number 2 and 3 movies Silverscreen
*Bronysith buries FlootarShay in alive in cement
<Ihop> here we go
<Sumica> 00,10the first one was fine
<spitfirecolt> i like the new gorden
<DocSane> Really weak Commisioner Gordon in this movie
<JESmith71> Yeah for some reason we have big ol Pat Hingle as Gordon in all four of these films
<CreativePonyName> ok ok harvey dent is balck and the comishoner is fat WUT
<pikoBat> GLaDOS 0.1
<RosePetal> That's your opinon I respect that.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: wat
<AlienWarhead> Clayface totally
<somepony_else> holy cheeseburger batman
<Ghosties> 04Gary Oldman is the shit
<Benickerson> ugh, buffer
*FlootarShay breaks out of cementy tomb
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Sumica: 3 Especially.
<RosePetal> BATMAN.
<flutter_spin> O.o
<The_Bookworm> And Batman
<Shadow_Dash454> oh the classic gun sounds
<Darf14> .....there doomed
<Ghosties> 04"I'm Batman"
<SirGanjalf> Burton's Gordon or Nolan's Gordon. Well, for me, the choice is obvious...
<Everlasting_Joy> It makes sense to disguise his voice, but Bale over-did it.
<OohShiny> sup Batman
<Buytoast> well dent is brown in the animated series, no reason he can't be black in this
<Michael> batspray!
<pikoBat> NAM TAB!?
<mitamaking> The Gordon in these movies was just there to have a Gordon
<Haber> Batman to rescue
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties Gary Oldman is best gary
<Wirisme> YAY
<Buytoast> but fat gordon is wierd
*Bronysith sets a tonberry next to FlootarShay
<_bane_> did batman, shoot him??
<FlootarShay> You cannot win
<MrBen> Railing k--wait, no.
<Sumica> 00,10I used that move alot in the game
<pony_300> Sumica: that gravely voice is NOT made for yelling. It just isn't.
<twilight_sprinkle> IDELUAAAA
<DIZZYRATCHET> epic entrance
<RosePetal> No, he's hanging around.
<FlootarShay> and whats a tonberry
<OpticalPie> o..m..g
<flutter_spin> best reaction ever
<Michael> oh my gaaaaawd
<Bronysith> otakon: tell him
<Kandarihu> pikoBat, GLaDOS 0.1 would be HARDAC
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love how awkward the batman move in this movie
<Deadlypon3> "Oh My god"
<RosePetal> My God.... It's Batman.
<Darf14> the tabloids were true!
<twilight_sprinkle> oh my gooooooooooooood
<Kammerjunk> Kind of like a dingleberry.
<Wirisme> mother of god
<Silverscreen> 01,11Deadlypon3: Voice recognition is easy to use to learn one's identity in the modern world, and choosing to disguise it proved to be a good thing when he electively became Public Enemy #1.
<Shadow_Dash454> batman! everybody run!
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> WHEREARETHEDETENATORSRAMAOFM
<The_Bookworm> RosePetal: Well I'm sure Batman thanks him for swinging in

<flutter_spin> Not the ooze! Quick! Save Roger Rabbit!
<Kammerjunk> I dunno.
<Eli> taht doesn't look healthy...
<DocSane> shogipony: Me, too.
<Kandarihu> pikoBat, from Batman TAS
<Shadow_Dash454> people are really bad shots in this movie
<Ghosties> 04Fun fact: My mom met the man who played Comissioner Gordon in this film at a restaurant she worked at one time
<Sumica> 00,10bat FACED
<Bronysith> a tonberry is a little monster that kills you in 1 shot no matter how high your defense
<MrBen> flutter_spin: That was Dip
<Deadlypon3> Silverscreen "SWEAR TO ME! WHERe are the DRUGS gooooin"
<OohShiny> ouch

<Deadlypon3> pew pew is best pew pew :D
<pikoBat> Kandarihu: But tbh, that would be GLaDOS 0.67.
<FlootarShay> Bronysith neither can I
<DocSane> Fight choreography is so-so, but we hadn't assimilated Hong Kong action films yet.
<Ghosties> 04According to my mom he was very charming
<flutter_spin> lol. Two references in one. What was "the ooze" from?
<mitamaking> This has a better theme
<spitfirecolt> awesome music

<Deadlypon3> "Oh, the joker is downstairs, just FYI"
<RosePetal> Bruce, who is laughing?
<DocSane> Another thing in this movie's favor is it handles Joker's origin very well.
<Haber> Heath Ledger laugh is better
<oni_link> what is is Ghosties ?

<DSNesmith> oh, right, not made post 90s

<fluttercry> 05,15Silverscreen I actually didn't hate it. It was NOWHERE near as good as the first one. But I didn't think it was THAT bad
<CrimsonPhoenix> that scene
<DocSane> Deadlypon3: The falling in the vat of chemicals is pretty much the only origin.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> WENDY, IM HOOOOOOME!

<Kammerjunk> DSNesmith, you are officially better at this 'posting' thing than otakon.
<Phase4> 00,02Eli, you sure?
<Tomlpchan> Phase4: Jack Nicholson is AMAZING too, I consider him Ledger tier, though Ledger was really at a whle new level, Nicholson was gof
<Bat_Quick_Thinker> hes joker
<Deadlypon3> Docsane but Joker isn't a former MOB member!
<RosePetal> Get READY.
<DSNesmith> one thing I liked about nolan's joker is that they kept his backstory ambiguous, like the comics
<otakon> ...
<DocSane> Deadlypon3: The only question is WHO exactly he was before he fell in.
<ROHKARA> The Killing Joke was pretty good
<alexxm> jokers first victim

<Tomlpchan> god*
<oni_link> pony_300: weird?
<Tomlpchan> fammit

<XylemTube> Joker is the real element of laughter
<AJIsAwesome> RosePetal: Make up.

<Kammerjunk> nope.avi
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> that sort of thing could get a man FIRED?

<pony_300> DocSane: ROFL
<XylemTube> oh lord
<Haber> that white patch is mezmerising
<Bubbles> Sick burn, bro.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Meanwhile: he got fired

*Sonny say yay
<Michael> lmao
<Tomlpchan> He has what the business people call a Burnout
<String_Shredder> AHAHAHAHAHAHHA
<Sonny> damnit doesn't work
<Madfish> It was the shock of how reasonable the Joker can be
<Spazturtle> best joker
<AlienWarhead> He needs some burn heal
<Kammerjunk> Well, at least he's always looking on the bright side of life now.
<Everlasting_Joy> That laugh was awesome.
<rabidsonic220> da fuq
<Fisheh_Fish> >.> creepy joker is best joker
<OohShiny> Joker is just fucking funny
<MrBen> These puns
<CK|GW2> So this movie is where Eastwood got the idea to give a speech to an empty chair.
<ScarecrowGanjalf> RosePetal: He lost it at the surgeon
<DSNesmith> wonder if nicholson had to actually smile the entire time in order to not break the makeup
<MrBen> I love 'em
<Fisheh_Fish> CK|GW2: Lol
<AJIsAwesome> And many CSI jokes were made that day.
<RosePetal> I know.

<MASF123|> LMAO! :D
<RainbowDash90> meep

<AlienWarhead> Rain No BamTan
<Tomlpchan> Smiderpan
<Kammerjunk> No, they just stuck metal pipes into his mouth and forgot to take them out.
<Petrified_Discord> Good evening everypony. Sorry I'm late :)
<MrBen> That's no manor. That, sir, is a castle.
<MASF123|> rich guy is a Spy!
<Michael> ohai Petrified_Discord
<Shibaru> "Can you help me get this magical disappearing bra around my boobs?" The things I say to my mom sometimes...
<RosePetal> Batman is so rich he owns a castle.
<SafariMonkey> Hey Petrified_Discord
<Canadian_Brony> hi Petrified_Discord
<AJIsAwesome> Petrified_Discord: Hi! :)
<DSNesmith> it occurs to me that watching one flew over the cuckoo's nest right after this might be amusing
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hey Petrified_Discord
<Rain> Ermahgerd, Behtmahn!
<RosePetal> Memories.
<MrBen> Hey Petrified_Discord
<oni_link> hahaha Im dying reading all those hero names :D

<alexxm> how are things Petrified_Discord
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> That's no manor...that's a SPACE STATION :O :D
<ScarecrowGanjalf> "I'm Baman! And i'm Piderman! I come ober da house! We're best fwiends!"
<OohShiny> RosePetal: Batman is so rich that he has another batman
<Canadian_Brony|AFK> bbl
<Cades> lol
<fluttercry> 05,15Great movie
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<RainbowDash90> blasted buffer >.<
<OohShiny> he leaves roses where he killed people
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ScarecrowGanjalf lol YES
<oni_link> ScarecrowGanjalf: whatever happened to that series?
<Ryunosuke> this canon
<Ihop> aww
<DB_Brony> DUN DUUUUNNN
<DSNesmith> so uh
<RosePetal> It's the exact place where his parents died.
<Meanwhile> Flung goo over the cuckoo's breast.
<DSNesmith> why doesn't he put the flowers on their graves
<CK|GW2> Wouldn't it make a bit more sense to put those roses at their graves...?
<DSNesmith> instead of where they got shot
<Rosfox> where his parents died
<AlienWarhead> after that Zorro movie
<MrBen> CK|GW2: I know, really
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> leave them
<ScarecrowGanjalf> oni_link: Have no idea:(
<shogipony> yeah azriel
<Kammerjunk> DSNesmith: Because he's the goddamn Batman.
<Silverscreen> 01,11You know what's sad? Batman and Superman have had a longer and much more colorful history in the visula media than any other superhero, and yet Marvel somehow managed to get the Avengers movie out before we got a World's Finest movie movie. -_-
<DSNesmith> of course
<DSNesmith> how silly of me
<CK|GW2> I mean, if you leave 'em on the ground like that, people will just, like, take 'em.
<oni_link> ScarecrowGanjalf: I only got to see like one episode and then ded :(
<Eli> the press is a plague
<RosePetal> We do have a worlds finest movie.
<oni_link> CK|GW2: or step on em
<Sumica> 00,10cause they threw money at the problem Silverscreen
<Spazturtle> CK|GW2: They died in a fire, no bodies
<fluttercry> 05,15because Marvel has a better assortment of heroes. DC has Batman and Superman, and nobody else is that interesting
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Mime
<AlienWarhead> Silverscreen all we got was a joke in I Am Legend
<Ghosties> 04Um
<CrimsonPhoenix> World's Finest movie?
<CK|GW2> OH GOD A MIME
<Cades> I accidently drew a dragon head in math class today :p
<Shibaru> "Mike's penis" The things I say sometimes...
<DSNesmith> mimes
<Ghosties> 04Green Lantern?
<RosePetal> Dat mime.
<DSNesmith> burn
<MrBen> RosePetal: We do?
<CK|GW2> QUICK CHOP ITS HEAD OFF
<Deadlypon3> ...Well
<Michael> wat
<JESmith71> Silverscreen: By movie movie i guess that means the animated World's Finest film doesn't count?
<The_Bookworm> Dat mime
<Deadlypon3> Uhm...

<MrBen> Dat mime
<ScarecrowGanjalf> Mime! Kill it!
<RosePetal> Don't we.

<Meanwhile> Beware the mimes.
<Ryunosuke> "you know, a Mime, is a terrible thing to waste"
<Michael> dat mim
<MASF123|> I like Marvel more than DC
<Deadlypon3> That isn't SILLY
<DB_Brony> suspicious mime....
<shogipony> no joker
<RosePetal> MIME IS VILLIAN.
<Bipolarized> Robot Mime!
<Applechip> Hi pointless mime...
<_bane_> worst... mime... ever
<Rosfox> dat mime
<fluttercry> 05,15also, Superman is a boring ass hero

<Bronysith> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIL
<DSNesmith> depends on who he's fighting, fluttercry
<Ghosties> 04Superman is just boring
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dem mimes
<Bronysith> EVIL EVIL EVIL EVIL
<Silverscreen> 01,11Fluttercy: They're not interesting because we don't know the characters. We don't know the characters because DC hasn't done other movies.
<DocSane> Truly, he is the world's greatest detective.
<Ghosties> 04He's Mr. Perfect
<AlienWarhead> @fluttercry the Justice League cartoon was good though
<SafariMonkey> Superman is boring
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> if only it were like Arkham City when Batman went to the spot of his parent :'( that paino as batman pays his respects moved me
<alexxm> ok that mime couldn't be more conspicuos
<RosePetal> We are surrounded by mimes.
<Ryunosuke> cowvarkian, Men in Tights :)
<Ghosties> 04Oh god
<Shibaru> I go to Gen's now. bye. 8)
<Meanwhile> Mimes truly are evil.
<Ghosties> 04Joker wut are you doing
<RosePetal> It's the Joker!
<cowvarkian> that too Ryunosuke
<Meanwhile> Stahp
<Cades> alright, peace.
<RosePetal> Seems legit.
<MASF123|> That music is in LEGO Batamn, btw.
<Michael> not the mimes!
<Bat_Quick_Thinker> ITS A TRAP
<Midnight_Fyre> Joker isn't a very good mime
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Best thing about Superman is Lex Luger to be honest.
<MrBen> Oh Joker.
<ScarecrowGanjalf> dat tophat
<AlienWarhead> Superman is interesting with a good writer
<Ghosties> 04Tophat Joker, get yours before they run out
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Dead
<CK|GW2> WAT
<OohShiny> ded
<RosePetal> ded.
<oni_link> Honestly, I love Marverl but I dont like the direction the Avengers is going towards. The style is off. And I wanna see an Avengers Civil War movie!
<Petrified_Discord> Um...that's a quil
<Bat_Quick_Thinker> WOAH
<Darf14> good arm
<ScarecrowGanjalf> Like a sir!
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat accuracy
<Fisheh_Fish> ded
<Rosfox> ouch
<RosePetal> It's a poison dart!
<flutter_spin> dat line
<pony_300> Silver: That is sad, but then I can see why; with how the movies are done, Batman and Superman are two different worlds. In order for a S/B movie to work, they would have to bring Batman into Superman's world with more unusual reality and physics
<CK|GW2> Uh, arrest him?
<DSNesmith> looks like he just signed that guy's death warrant
<MrBen> Killed with a quill.
<oni_link> *Marvel

<CK|GW2> And Bruce is just like "durrrrrr wut just happened"
<fluttercry> 05,15Sumica only bits and pieces
<RosePetal> Bruce Wayne is not amused.

<ScarecrowGanjalf> Uhm... Bruce, you don't have your bulletproof suit on
<AJIsAwesome> CK|GW2: :D
<RosePetal> Lando is right behind them.
<AlienWarhead> yay

<otakon> damn long arm
<alexxm> lando would have been intresting as two face
<twilight_sprinkle> *rage <.<
<The_Bookworm> Batman.
<otakon> THE IRONY
<CK|GW2> Now you have to go stealing another TV.
<DB_Brony> you could just turn the tv off....it'll save some money
<oni_link> Heavy should have one of those :D
<OohShiny> you're dressed as a joker...
<DocSane> Again, reinforcing my belief that Bruce Wayne is kind of autistic in this movie.
<Ghosties> 04Looked more like Bruce was practicing his Mark Walberg face
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> enama
<Meanwhile> An enema.
<Tomlpchan> RAHE
<flutter_spin> lol
<RosePetal> It's DC Universe.
<CK|GW2> ....did he just say that?
<otakon> also, that fist is very strong
<fluttercry> 05,15ewww
<pony_300> Harvey Dent: I'm going to break down the crime world's doors, and give them a Colt 45.
<Ryunosuke> umm

<DSNesmith> alfred the scientist
<Sumica> 00,10yes he said that
<DB_Brony> classic
<otakon> no
<Rain> that was awesome
<RosePetal> Yes because they will totally listen to you after you killed that guy Joker.
<otakon> he's a former medic for the RAF IIRC though
<Kandarihu> Sounds like a blooper that Burton just wanted to throw in
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> "weight"
<DSNesmith> it's bruce's libido, alfred
<flutter_spin> woah
<AJIsAwesome> Yuck..........:S

<otakon> CK|GW2: too old
<AJIsAwesome> CK|GW2: Forced meme is forced?
<Kammerjunk> wat
<DocSane> OohShiny: I don't think he does.
<MLP_Brovakiin> OohShiny: On thursdays
<CrimsonPhoenix> OohShiny, I've been asking that question before
<fluttercry> 05,15This chat needs an enema.....no that doesn't work

<ScarecrowGanjalf> Uh, so those are post-death photos?
<RosePetal> Candy Walker what kind of name is that?
<DSNesmith> like hugo weaving in V for Vendetta
<Bipolarized> That's a stripper name if I ever heard one.
<CrimsonPhoenix> MrBen, Vicki hasn't been voiced by Tara you dolt

<otakon> RosePetal: eeyup, but with fish
<Sonny> lol
<RosePetal> Except he wouldnt kill people.
<MrBen> Hoo boy.
<Deadlypon3> Glad that we could turn that off :p
<DocSane> This is what the Joker would do in the comics.
<Michael> joker is best troll
<OohShiny> am I the only one laughing at ded people?
<CK|GW2> Ya know, it's hard to take this guy entirely seriously as a villain.
<Yahooz> Best way to do a bane voice is to talk like Sean Connery into a glass mug
<RosePetal> That's true.
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm Bronystate's reckoning
<RAWRity> When the Thunder Badge is earned, you have my permission to Fly
<Petrified_Discord> Terrorism is causing fear. Joker causes laughter. I don't even anymore.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> art
<Fisheh_Fish> Deadly troll is best troll?
<Midnight_Fyre> Fisheh_Fish: This was the 80s, back before terrorism got all serious

<Kammerjunk> otakon: Hey, don't hate on TF2.
<oni_link> Petrified_Discord: im lost too
<Kammerjunk> Hats are cool.
<otakon> DSNesmith: but that's the thing, the Joker is a mad genius
<Randomnerd> Interesting problem with assholes on the internet... Where does one's right to speak conflict with one's right to not have to hear it?

<pikorar> EW! HER FACE!
<AlienWarhead> Pony toys
<Ryunosuke> nice hair
<ScarecrowGanjalf> I tell you hwat!
<otakon> No beauty or hygeine products used
<pony_300> man, those two already look dead
<_bane_> dam, they ugly
<The_Bookworm> Her hair
<DSNesmith> but he's not supposed to be a brainy villain
<Tomlpchan> > No makeup, Hahahaha
<DocSane> Apparently lack of beauty products prevents them from brushing their damn hair.
<Darf14> she looks like she has a bad hair day
<otakon> except for Billy Dee Williams
<CrimsonPhoenix> HOy Lando
<AJIsAwesome> I guess that woman is Kristen Stewarts's inspiration. :D
<DSNesmith> he's cunning, but his schtick isn't intelligence
<Dusty> lol, i see why he put it in makeup products
<MLP_Brovakiin> AlienWarhead: Oh noo! D:
<otakon> his pomade is unaffected
<Kandarihu> Terrorism is trying to affect political change with the credible threat of violence. This isn't really what the Joker is doing.
<oni_link> that lady LOOKED LIKE CRAP
<The_Bookworm> And Lando
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Lando's talkin to Vader
<Sumica> 00,10it's because they were not useing any thing that might have the smilex in it
<RosePetal> It's Kristen Stewarts Mother.
<flutter_spin> the blue button!
<Midnight_Fyre> Fisheh_Fish, well, before 2001 it wasn't such a sore subject at least

<DSNesmith> mmm, I love that word. schtick, schtick
<otakon> Sumica: no no,not smilex smiley
<pony_300> tomlpchan: ahhhhhh, now I get it!
<Randomnerd> I found a really interesting article about that. I was thunderstruck by the first assertion about geeks... "Ostracizers are evil".
<shogipony> comming from him that meant alot
<otakon> Silverscreen: no idea
<CK|GW2> RosePetal: No, it's not. See, the Joker was always a character who had a lot of humor but behind it was that subtle undertone that made you take him seriously, because you knew he was batshit nuts.
<RosePetal> Dat sweater.
<flutter_spin> Tovler: dat Fairly Oddparents ref
<AlienWarhead> yay
<OohShiny> lol
<otakon> dat makeup

<Sumica> 00,10more big lip moments
<oni_link> makeup is srs buisness
<ScarecrowGanjalf> D:
<DB_Brony> ummm...makeup on makeup?
<Randomnerd> The idea being that nerds are scared to tell someone off because they conflate it with bullying.
<DSNesmith> wait so is his face white
<otakon> okay that is creepy
<AJIsAwesome> Joker is now fabulous!!!
<MrBen> Dat zombie
<Dusty> yikes
<Darf14> That mask looks safe
<RosePetal> Daddy, don't you mean Mr. J?
<Deadlypon3> ....Hawwwwt
<String_Shredder> ART!
<MrBen> Wait.
<Silverscreen> 01,11The thing is, everyone's starting to look like sh*t because they refuse to use ANYTHING out of fear of Smilex being in it.
<Michael> dat music <3
<Clayface> Dark Knight's Joker's motivation seemed to be to spread anarchy and chaos, while this Joker's motivation seems like it IS anarchy and chaos
<DSNesmith> or they're just beta
<Kammerjunk> That's silly.
<flutter_spin> ha. Mr. J :P
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> that was creepier than Jokers.
<otakon> DB_Brony: more like makeup over disfigured face
<ScarecrowGanjalf> Btw: She's not Harley
<ROHKARA> The Joker doesn't wear make-up
<Dusty> i almost lost my sandvich
<Deadlypon3> Silverscreen AH. Sublte
<Sumica> 00,10yeah his face is permentatly white from the acid
<Everlasting_Joy> AJIsAwesome: No one is fabulous until Rarity gets done with them.
<MrBen> THAT WASN'T A, y'know, I'm not even gonna try anymore.
<pony_300> I love that pointless horror music they played to enhance that scene. Weird touch
<oni_link> whoooaaaa, take it eeasy on the cake baatter
<otakon> Silverscreen: SMILEY
<Kammerjunk> But then again, my entire class consists purely of nerds. So we all just yell at each other.
<Darf14> Shes at Deviantart
<AJIsAwesome> Everlasting_Joy: True. :D
<Kammerjunk> Especially about browsers and OS.
<DSNesmith> also the idea of a nerd being afraid of telling someone off
<ScarecrowGanjalf> oh the museum scene is great
<DSNesmith> is hilarious
<otakon> I bet that he was actually taking the makeup OFF in that shot
<MrBen> Everlasting_Joy: So very true.
<Tovler> I feel classy just by listening to this.
<Wirisme> dat Mozart
<CrimsonPhoenix> this scene is another classic
<Silverscreen> 01,11Clayface: way to rip from Nostalgia Critic without giving him credit.
<DB_Brony> otakon: you say tomato, I say tomato....wait...
<RosePetal> Yes, his skin is permantly white so he's using fleshy makeup.
<DSNesmith> who was the best captain
<AlienWarhead> Silverscreen its not like they buy makeup from the next town or something
<otakon> DB_Brony: lol doesn't work on chat
<Petrified_Discord> Tovler: I'd better put on my spare monacle!
*MrBen yawns.
<Dusty> aww
<Midnight_Fyre> This is why it is good to buy products imported from Chinese sweatshops instead of domestic brands
<Randomnerd> You've never had a "friend" you couldn't drive off?
<RosePetal> Where is my date? He's late!
<Ihop> kirk
<oni_link> DB_Brony: doestn work online :D
<Dusty> forever alone
<Kandarihu> Silverscreen, good point. I guess what the Joker did DOES fit what I defined as terrorism.
<DSNesmith> funny joke
<DSNesmith> but seriously
<fluttercry> 05,15Oh snap Silverscreen doesn't let anything fly

<pony_300> love this scene
<desertman2> yes
<Meanwhile> Alright then.

<DB_Brony> wait....did the joker bring a boombox otherwise he'd just be dancing without any music
<MrBen> CK|GW2: He's the Joker. He doesn't have rhyme or reason for the shit he does.
<DSNesmith> wow
<Rain> CK|GW2, he is the joker. he does everything for the shits and giggles
<Deadlypon3> Why put on the makeup if nobody will see you
<Silverscreen> 01,11Not really a BLAM considering that it lead to Joker meeting Vicki and Batman's confrontation with him.
<LunarRepublicGuard> reminds me of RUN DMC
<DSNesmith> she's smart
<RosePetal> lol the one painting he wont runin.
<Ghosties> 04Soooooo this is Joker's big crime? Defacing art?
<Canadian_Brony> and cut

<OohShiny> I hear aquarella?
<Deadlypon3> TRIBLE SUper Crap
<oni_link> damn, hes a lady likker
<CK|GW2> Well, that's not true either. Joker in the comics (as well as in the newer movies) had rhyme and reason for a lot of what they did, it was just a crazy reason generally, but there was some maddened strain of logic to it. >_>
<MrBen> That song sounds so familiar. Where have I heard it before...?
<RosePetal> He loves her because of her dark pictures.
<MLP_Brovakiin> creppe

<cowvarkian> really, thats what horrifies her
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Well that was underwhelming
<Ghosties> 04Ohhhh, so Joker's method is the latest philosophy of the avant-garde (which is basically murder as art, not unlike Cohen from Bioshock)
<twilight_sprinkle> shes the shredder
<The_Bookworm> What was on her face

<Sonny> Are you there?
<RosePetal> MY CABBAGES!@
<CK|GW2> I don't hate the Nolan tank. It's not iconic but definitely more practical, so it fit that world.

<MrBen> Canadian_Brony: Beat me to the punch
<JESmith71> Best Batmobile right there

<Nyst> The Batshack.
<oni_link> alexxm: :D
<Ghosties> 04I'm gonna lay it down: the best Batman voice was Kevin Conroy

<RosePetal> Dat music.
<Meanwhile> Sleep Hollow for B movie.
<Ryunosuke> *radio
<otakon> For some reason I'm reminded of the AMbigously Gay Duo
<Meanwhile> Sleepy*
<Randomnerd> The little dude's got the worst outfit in the comics.
<DSNesmith> "what, are you retarded or something? I'm the goddamn batman"
<SafariMonkey> yay
<Nyst> The Bathole.
<fluttercry> 05,15yay
<otakon> Ghosties: given, done, END OF SENTENCE.
<DB_Brony> Batman's expression is like "look lady i just got shot and just saved your life multiple times. We're going where I saw we're going!"
<DocSane> Ghosties: I won't argue with you.
<RanbowDash90> yay
<Wirisme> yay :(
<CreativePonyName> Ghosties: i second that

<AlienWarhead> Ryunosuke I have ponies on there

<otakon> Ghosties: agreed 1000000000%.
<Randomnerd> NO BATMARV.
<Canadian_Brony> otakon hooray for NC
<oni_link> Ghosties: was he the 90s Batman VA?
<DSNesmith> yes, conroy was the best batman
<DB_Brony> *say
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Ghosties: Imokwiththis.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> that was a pretty clearly layed out car track in the woods though
<KnifeH> I keep hearing this yay during my Batman watchage!
<KnifeH> HOW DARE YOU
<cloudy_skies> http://xkcd.com/1101/
<otakon> DSNesmith: best voice for him
<CK|GW2> ....
<RosePetal> Conroy is also best Batman.
<Ghosties> 04Conroy voiced Batman in The Animated Series, so yeah
<fluttercry> 05,15What would Japanese Batman be like?
<CK|GW2> That's a shitty parking spot
<Everlasting_Joy> Ghosties: Agreed.
<Dusty> o_0
<Silverscreen> 01,11Ha! You almost walked off the ledge.
<Nyst> The batress of solitude.
<otakon> Ghosties: and in the gream Arkham games
<CrimsonPhoenix> So basically
<Sumica> 00,10that one poor bat in a tiny cage
<OohShiny> the batcave
<CK|GW2> No really, look at that!
<rabidsonic220> bats, bats everywere
<Ghosties> 04Yep yep, ota
<Randomnerd> fluttercry: Roger Smith, from Big O.
<RosePetal> Conroy, Keaton and Bale are best Batmans.
<MrBen> Ghosties: No arguments there.
<DSNesmith> I'm going to put ledger's joker slightly above hamill's, because he wasn't restricted by the "kid's show" label
<JESmith71> The Batcave needs more railings
<CrimsonPhoenix> The Animated series is best Batman overall?
<Meanwhile> BATMANNU
<CK|GW2> What if he drove just a little too far?
<The_Bookworm> Ace Ventura would crap himself if he saw all those bats
<Ghosties> 04And, of course, Hamil voiced Joker in the Arkham games too
<Buytoast> Clooney was pretty good
<Meanwhile> Not unlike
<CK|GW2> His insurance agents must HATE this place
<Tovler> meh. I like the gnatcave more.
<shogipony> and best joker was mark hamill
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Maybe it's the Screwloose of the bat cave.
<KnifeH> o.o
<Meanwhile> SUPAIDAHMANNU
<BladedWings> The_Bookworm: true
<RosePetal> Batman you are taking this too seriously.
<DSNesmith> oh boy

<Dusty> nooo really
<Michael> nope
<Bronysith> end of discussion
<Bronysith> bad touch BAD TOUCH

<DocSane> pony_300: Yeah.
<Arby1120> >_>
<BatCreditCard> and sometimes theres sexy tocuh
<Ghosties> 04*yeah
<CK|GW2> pony_300: The intention was to show that crime and evil have no true "face".
<Shizuka> 13which is lamecake
<RosePetal> She would have known anyway.
<The_Bookworm> Dark92Enigma: That Roger Rabbit quote /)
<AlienWarhead> You are in
<DSNesmith> BECAUSE I'M THE GODDAMN BATMAN
<RaveBrony> O.o
<DocSane> pony_300: It's been portrayed in a number of media.
<fluttercry> 05,15tehlamez
<Michael> batman works alone
<DSNesmith> you are in, you're standing right here
<CK|GW2> pony_300: Which is why I don't like this change. It really doesn't work for me.
<Meanwhile> What d'you need brightly coloured tights for?
<Rain> "because Im not a fan of pegging"

<Meanwhile> Yeah we get it kids are shit
<RosePetal> The Dark Knight, and Batman Returns.
<Canadian_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix this is Batman
<Meanwhile> Who fucking cares
<CK|GW2> "It's something I have to do." Uh, no it's not. There are cops in this city and they haven't done ANYTHING all movie.
<Bronysith> WHAT IS WRONG WITH DRESS CODES NOWADAYS?!
<Kammerjunk> Well, I'm starting to dooze off, time for another enrr

<Meanwhile> Literally, I don't care, at all, and neither does anyone else really.
<Bronysith> and people are wondering why their kids get molestered
<MrBen> Sudden awkward romance.
<Dusty> that came out wrong
<RosePetal> Let's face it, The cops don't do anything in the Gotham at all.
<desertman2> Because they're useless
<Michael> batsuit!
<Meanwhile> I'm wondering why you're still talking.
<fluttercry> 05,15Think about it though. Sure the idiots will reproduce. But some day so will we. Then everything will be right with the world
<Shizuka> 13anyway re tights, you boys don't know what you're missing

<Meanwhile> Speak for yourself, I've worn tights.
<RosePetal> AH YEAHHHHH!
<DocSane> BATMAN!
<MrBen> Incomptence, thy name is Gotham Police Force.
<OohShiny> I'm batman!
<Canadian_Brony> CK|GW2 that's because this is a comic book universe. Cops do not exist.
<oni_link> OpticalPie: for you NOPE
<JESmith71> At least they didn't show the batass
<Bronysith> Meanwhile in tights
<alexxm> can the cops do anything on they're own in gotham

<NoImBatman> Bronysith it's because Bjornfot has strange fetishes

<Rain> but JESmith71, thats the best part of the whole suit.
<Meanwhile> She's got a point tbh.
<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: I do, and I must say I prefer my loose pants with pockets.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Hey now, there was that fat corrupt cop, and Gordon who hasn't done anything, and then there was also
<CK|GW2> So would that gun be called a "Batling Gun"?
<Michael> dem armor
<Kammerjunk> Large pockets, at any rate.
<DSNesmith> let's shoot the car at close range
<Bronysith> i just imagined Meanwhile in tights with his rape face
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ded
<RosePetal> Lol they are going to waste their bullets.
<pony_300> This Batman kills.
<The_Bookworm> hoom
<DSNesmith> bullets don't ricochet, right

<Kammerjunk> DSNesmith: They do now.
<DSNesmith> did batman just kill a bitch
<Thrackerzod> XD

<Canadian_Brony> an he bat mobile makes it outhow?
<RosePetal> Batman means Buisness!
<desertman2> It was his car that killed them
<Bronysith> NoImBatman: i cant draw, ask wrek
<Bjornfot> dayummm
<SafariMonkey> RainbowGuy: High explosives?
<Dark92Enigma> WTF BOOOOOOOOOOM
<BladedWings> did batman just kill some people?!

<otakon> I'm back
<Sumica> 00,10it's not cold blood if they are armed DocSane
<Ryunosuke> micheal bay directed that part
<otakon> what I miss?
<fluttercry> 05,15I dunno, I think it would feel weird to wear tights
<CK|GW2> Did he just seriously blow them up in a Looney Tunes style bomb drop?
<AlienWarhead> I'm they are all sleeping..... in the fire
<Noob709> Batman's all like "brb gotta blow up a castle for no reason"
<Michael> but batman cant kill!
<ROHKARA> He did kill at first
<Bronysith> fluttercry: i think it would be kewl
<CK|GW2> Also, did Batman just seriously murder those guys?
<Thrackerzod> lol batman killed pepole
<Shizuka> 13pockets are good, i've found jeans are usually too well fit to actually use the pockets... is why i usually wear a light jacket
<Bronysith> latex tights
<Canadian_Brony> "Good car."
<sentry> well warner owns dc
<The_Bookworm> Ryunosuke: I knew a Michael Bay joke would come up
<DSNesmith> tights would be painfully restrictive
<otakon> Ryunosuke: that was the signal of Bay's birth
<oni_link> Corvette Batmobile is best Batmobile
<Buytoast> if it's just the batmobile on auto pilot, then he may not have been sure of people inside
<RaveBrony> My ex rarely wore tights. But i liked it when she did :D
<DSNesmith> a kilt is more my style
<desertman2> See, he wasn't in the car
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> "I'm not going to kill you. But I don't have to save you from this bomb i'm dropping off either."
<RosePetal> Someone said he did in the earlier comics? No his car did.
<Dark92Enigma> BladedWings: MORE like The Joker's minions
<Bright_Shadow> It's the second one when he really starts killing people
<Spazturtle> Sumica: It is if there is no risk to anyone else
<Sumica> 00,10and he did't kill, the car did >_>
<Rosfox> :c
<Bronysith> i just fucking freeball all day long
<Ryunosuke> that joker copter
<DSNesmith> IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN

<Midnight_Fyre> DSNesmith: Well, considering you are wearing nothing underneath . . .

<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: Right-o.

<otakon> Meanwhile: she wouldn't fit in bigger jeans
<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinkle BladedWings point taken
<pikorar> Silverscreen: Don't worry, one clown in particular has a fear of bats, and men!3
<Buytoast> i hope that money explodes

<Bronysith> that is why otakon is now imagining Thane in a kilt
<sentry> free money free money, everyone freeee money!
<DSNesmith> well as long as it's not rough wool or anything
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> You'd think there'd be a cop or two or something...
<RosePetal> The police are lazy today.
<ScarecrowGanjalf> Yep, Joker is Pinkamena in that movie
<otakon> I'd like a kilt actually
<Meanwhile> otakon: That's what belts are for.
<SafariMonkey> RainbowGuy: sorry, high explosives refer to detonation not burning... I didn't see how you'd tell

<OohShiny> Movie's over
<RosePetal> Batman can't die!
<MrBen> ...lawls
<DSNesmith> it's a movie about horrible people doing stupid things
<Meanwhile> Does it also extend to occasional bouts of speaking in the third person?
<Spazturtle> CK|GW2: You can shoot any plane down with a gun
<DSNesmith> but it's intentional
<_bane_> all that, from a pistol
<SafariMonkey> bulletproof plane blows like paper?
<otakon> Shizuka: it's basically if the Nazi's won and then fought aliens
<RosePetal> He dissapeared again.
<AlienWarhead> The Batwing wasn't made well
<Dark92Enigma> I CAN'T DIE......I'M BATMAN
<MrBen> Great. Now this has me thinking of that dumb joke.
<Wirisme> I can't die i'm the protagonist!

<MrBen> Point blank 3 three feet away
<Shizuka> 13neil patrick wonka
<CK|GW2> Spazturtle: Besides, a revolver with a barrel like that wouldn't fire right.
<OohShiny> Joker Walkie Talkie
<RosePetal> Don't follow him!
<Sumica> 00,10if it did that to the bat wing just think what it would do to her head.
<otakon> where is RX?
<Dark92Enigma> 10 SECONDS FLAT
<Meanwhile> I like Starship Troopers. It amuses me.
<RosePetal> I'm alive!
<Tomlpchan> Sumica: :D
<DSNesmith> half the fun of the movie is coming up with nicknames for the troopers
<OohShiny> I'm batman!
