<Chimera> 04I should be evil and change yellow to dark red
<Sumica> we only have 26 eps of mlp so we cant just show them over and over.

<hunty> 0indeed
<EmDeeEighty> but you never get a mention
<PeanutButterWolf> This was one of like 3 animes that play on Adult Swim
<Kenko706> The nsecond season wound up making more and less sense at the exact same time... and was co-produced by CN, making it possibly the first real American-- partly-- anime.
<Rainbow_derp> PeanutButterWolf or they did
<RoyalGuardTictac> @Sumica that would explain why its still going so late
<EmDeeEighty> Ken, I actually agree with that
<Drake> 04wat
<Drake> 04If it was the other team sure but...
<EmDeeEighty> without CN there would be no second series
<Umbreon> 12Drake looks cute
<Umbreon> 12when he's looking at Ascendant
<Rainbow_derp> RoyalGuardTictac cuz no pony wants to go

<EmDeeEighty> FLCL was.... uh.....
<Chimera> 05Gordon > Morgan
<FreezeFrame> Kenko: It was originally going to be 3 seasons, not 2
<Drake> 04I may/may not be aromantic
<hunty> 0but i dont know how they could have taken it farther after the ending scene
<Chimera> 05because GORDON FREEMAN
<Drake> 04Which may have a factor in this
<Drake> 04So go deal with it
<Kenko706> I know. Wish they had been able to do 3...
<Chimera> 05Drake I don't need to deal with it
<Chimera> 05Ascendant does
*Chimera hides
<FreezeFrame> But Tim and Eric threw a hissy fit about it getting time from people in AS and threatened to pull their (shitty) shows
<Drake> 04THEN WHY DO YOU CARE
<hunty> 0hey guys
<PeanutButterWolf> So they blew their wad on those 6 episodes?
<Ascendant> I don't deal with it

<hunty> 0it was on the mainpage a while back
<hunty> 0well the status update anyay
<hunty> 0*anyway
<CaaZzz> Armageddon, is it alright if I use this server to spam connections in order to try and get my bot running right and then various reconnects later until I add in the reload command and stuff.
<quill9293> i've come to the realization much to the dismay of a few select people that alot of the good shipping fics i've read have ahd and OC or a fan named character, like when the mane six are involved the romance is usually rushed and poorly thoughtout *not to mention cheesy*
<CaaZzz> ... Plus a question mark somewhere in there
<Hogia> 12:o
<Hogia> 12http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ENjmYTB1Ee0 ;D
<Hogia> 12:D
<hunty> 0which ones are you reading?
<Shiggy> i just dislike shipping in general
<quill9293> except for twiluna pics, thouse are usually well paced
<quill9293> fics*
<hunty> 0also heres lauren and her animation team in pony costumes
<hunty> 0http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/fim-animators-cosplaying-as-ponies.html

<Sumica> Something like that yeah 18chapters so far
<quill9293> no clue
<hunty> 0oof
<Sumica> Been trying to take the whole fanfic thing slowly. I tend to be a bit picky when it comes to what i read.
<Shiggy> same here
<Sumica> that being said I think I have read all of 3 =p
*Umbreon doesn't set any fox traps out for SheenaFox, he instead runs you over with Kyu
<Umbreon> 12!kyu
*Kyu 7does a barrel roll! ._.      |:      .-.      :|      ._.
<quill9293> i was the same way sumica and still am...boy have i stopped reading a fic half way manytimes cus of how bad it was...god especially mane sixshipping its all rushed
<SheenaFox> But
<Sumica> One that must have been some what poor as the name eludes me past sins and cross and arrow.
<SheenaFox> but D:
<Umbreon> 12hi
<fry> Caaz, it's trivial :p
<SheenaFox> !Umbreon
*Umbreon now belongs to SheenaFox for 9 minutes
<Umbreon> 12noooo
<SheenaFox> !eXAKR
*eXAKR now belongs to SheenaFox for 10 minutes
<Shiggy> thats why i dont read ships that much anymore
*SheenaFox is not owned by Umbreon and never will be! |D
<fry> naw some good ol chopin will probably do it
<Caaz> Chopin's bitchin.
<Umbreon> !sheenafox
<quill9293> there was a ongoing twiluna fic i really liked...which i hope updates soon...
<fry> indeed
<SheenaFox> nope
<Caaz> Sometimes I don't know if it's just random smashing keys or actual music though
<Shiggy> last ship i read that i enjoyed was this one fluttershy/luna fic
<Sumica> I have also taken up the habet of keylocking my pc as well I dont think I have closed Eqd or the list of fics I am thinking of reading for around 3 weeks.
<quill9293> i think i know which one your talking about...if only because there is only one lunashy fic on eqd
<fry> chopins music is never random :p
<Umbreon> 12[01:34:33] * SheenaFox now belongs to Umbreon for 20 hours
*SheenaFox is not owned by Umbreon and never will be! |D
<fry> personally i prefer bachs counterpoint the best
<fry> people wonder why, idk i just like counterpoint
<Umbreon> 12i must be hated ;-;
<Shiggy> really?
<quill9293> yeah actually
<Caaz> Hnn I don't hear much of bach often
<Shiggy> hm
<quill9293> now ships i hate..... TWIXIE GAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Shiggy> NEED A MOMENT?
<quill9293> lyra and octavia, sorry shes married
<Sumica> Anyone else noticing less and less scootabuse? in the last few weeks/
<quill9293> thats good
<quill9293> i perfer her to be hero worshipping dash
<hunty> 0octavia is married?
<quill9293> ....lyra....
<hunty> 0she is?!?
<quill9293> its fanon....
<hunty> 0to who?
<quill9293> and i was kinda saying it as a joke
*Sumica waits for the joke
<quill9293> bon bon
<sotha> Bonbon
<sotha> er yeah
<quill9293> XD
<hunty> 0oh i love bon bon
<hunty> 0:D
<sotha> Lyra x Bon Bon is the only legitimate lyra ship.
<quill9293> yup
<hunty> 0only real one
<Sumica> Lyra amuses me cause she likes to photo bomb alot of shots.
<sotha> You know, because they were seen together in almost every scene that had them in the show.
<hunty> 0i love lyra
<hunty> 0omg
<hunty> 0in boast busters when the ursa shows
<hunty> 0bon bon doesnt have a cutie mark
<quill9293> shipping anyone of the mane six to vinyl ihate (also i adore lyra as well being my fav bg pony)
<Sumica> especially ones where she is grinning like a crackhead in the background.
<sotha> It makes you wonder whether she is like that all the time, or knows when the camera is present.
<fry> i play bachs music all the time at church
<Sumica> pinky sense perhaps?
<quill9293> lol
<sotha> a natural star.
<hunty> 0lyra breaks the 4th wall
<quill9293> i loves lyra
<Sumica> and yes I use Lyra for my icon on eqd.
<sotha> I want to use Lyra.
<quill9293> and after feedback i adore vinyl soooo much
<sotha> but I haven't decided yet.
<hunty> 0i dont have an eqd account D;
<sotha> She seems underappreciated as far as pony icons go
<sotha> You'll need one to post anything.
<quill9293> me neither
<hunty> 0true
<sotha> And anyway, I come from places on the internet where there are only accounts, so I feel more comfortable having one.
<hunty> 0who else loves blue bells?
<Sumica> yeah it's kinda odd though you have to use a phone to set up a google account.
<quill9293> ...?
<hunty> 0blue bells
<sotha> I found making a Blogger account easiest. The only thing you need to give it is your email, and then just exit when it asks you to name your blog.
<hunty> 0runs the music shop in ponyville
<sotha> When in the series was that?
<hunty> 0cutie mark something or another
<Sumica> oh and if you want to see the icon I used. http://miburl.com/j99Dpb
<hunty> 0i think
<hunty> 0ill find him
<quill9293> since i cant draw my ponysona will probably never see light of day, but u guys got one?
<Sumica> Havent realy tryed to flesh one out personaly.
<Shiggy> nope.avi
<sotha> I'm ruminating on the possibilites. Would you illuminate?
<Sumica> thought about marks but never settled on one.
<sotha> (brohoof if you got that reference)
<hunty> 0hunter pounce
<quill9293> mine would be a quill
<Sumica> aladin
<quill9293> hence the username :P
<Sumica> I think
<sotha> Easy one. *brohoof*
<quill9293> any of yall have a skype, it'd be cool to keep in touch
<sotha> Your pony would be a quill? How interesting.
<sotha> I do.
<FreezeFrame> sleep time
<quill9293> yes me and my pony self wish to be a writer
<Sumica> I thought about architect tools as I am a draftsman but I am also a cook so go figure.
<shiggy> ugh, got disconnected
<quill9293> hee maybe a mix of both ^^
<quill9293> my skype name is creed9294
<Caaz> I used to have a bunch of pianists on iTunes but I totally lost it all
<Sumica> my problem is thought I can draw anything organic forth a damn. Plans no problem but yeah.
<quill9293> cool, thats understandable
<hunty> 0i dont know how to use skype D;
<FlutterHi> finished that fanfic
<shiggy> its simple
<FlutterHi> ... ADORABLE
<Sumica> So defnatly would use a template if I ever tried to make one. and no dont have skype
<FlutterHi> did prince ever come back?
<sotha> My pony would have a chess piece as a cutie mark (probably a knight), as I have a passion for designing . . . things (e.g. abstract strategy game, collectible card games, musical instruments. . . I mean, I'm even going to school to be a chemical engineer).
<RePod> \:D/
<quill9293> its real simple hunty its just like aim, cept you can mic talk and video chat
<sotha> Which FlutterHi?
<Caaz> r.r
<sotha> Anyway, my skype is soltha
<shiggy> my pony would have a couch as his cutie mark
<quill9293> hah
<shiggy> because that is what my life revolves around
<sotha> William Forte?
<Sumica> Oh I do use steam though.
<sotha> Could the couch be potato-e?
<quill9293> yeah bro thats me

<Sumica> couches and quills eh? wasn't that one in an ep
<sotha> You could sell couches.
<sotha> Yes. Owls well that ends well.
<Sumica> that's right
<quill9293> eeyup
<hunty> 0ahah omg yes :D
<FlutterHi> did prince dari ever return?
<shiggy> i think i would develop a plush couch
<Sumica> oh that reminds me I need to check what hubs showing today.
<hunty> 0my cutie mark would be... (IDENTITY CRISIS) OMG BRB D:

<quill9293> it'll be stuck in my head again...and ya'll be the ones to blame...
<Sumica> I need to put my capture card back in my tower. So we can have S2 streams here.
<hunty> 0lets stream dot and the kangaroo
<hunty> 0OMG I LOVE FEED BACK <3
<quill9293> heee
<quill9293> seee i told ya its great, you finsih reading both chapters?
<Sumica> Oh I guess sence we were on the topic of marks for a bit. What type of pony?
<quill9293> pegasis
<hunty> 0halfway done with one
<shiggy> normal pony
<hunty> 0BUT ITS SO WELL WRITTEN :S{O
<quill9293> vinyl blind should be fanon
<hunty> 0i want to be a pegasis
<hunty> 0i cant stand being told what to do
<Sumica> what fic?
<quill9293> heh
<hunty> 0i hate limitations too
<sotha> All of the normal ponies are normal.
<quill9293> i left the link a bit of ways up, its called feed back, and its a vinyl scratch ziggy stardust shipping fic, thats dear to my heart
<shiggy> i would be a normal normal pony
<Sumica> the Ditzy doo one?
<sotha> I would almost definitely be a unicorn (not by choice).
<quill9293> i would have a ponytail mane and i still have not decided upon a mane or coat color...
<quill9293> i have really long hair
<Sumica> oh there it is way up, was alomst off my log.
<quill9293> lol good you found it
*Sumica adds it to the pile.
<sotha> My hair is kind of curly (like ringlets), about 10 inches long
<quill9293> take it from me, its not only well written and paced well, it has some of the most adorable scenes i have ever seen
<hunty> 0damnit dari
<hunty> 0i need to read this
<Dashite> Custom Vinyl! Woo!
<hunty> 0stop tempting me with new post D;
<quill9293> *eyes brighten*
<sotha> I imagine I would be in neutral shades.
<Sumica> Would like the whole Pegasis thing but probably would not fit with a craftsman....crafstpony?
<quill9293> ehhh
<quill9293> why should personal decisions have to coincide with pony type?
<sotha> There were construction pegasi in Cloudsdale. It probably wouldn't be too far off.
<quill9293> *nods* yeah
<sotha> Speaking of which, what was that jack hammer even supposed to do?
<sotha> They can manipulate clouds with their hooves.
<quill9293> *pony shrug*
<sotha> name?
<quill9293> what i loved about that part was when the construction worker went *those wings are gorgeous* because he did it in a perfect new york accent *im from newyork*
<hunty> 0its ponies they dont gotta explain shit
<sotha> Okay fine. Don't answer my question.
<quill9293> huh?
<quill9293> it was a little vauge sorry
<Sumica> You know a friend of mine at work has one of those 3d printers I should totally get bring him in to the herd and then make my own ponies with it =p
<quill9293> were you asking about pony sona names?
<sotha> Cual seria tu nombre? (I hope I didn't botch that conjugation)
<sotha> jah
<quill9293> i have been struggleing with that to be honest, i think i just want to stick to the name Quill but ki dont know if that sounds too bland...
<shiggy> i completely lost track of this conversation
*sotha goes to spanish dictionary to check. . .
<sotha> We're talking about our ponysonas.
<Sumica> Would have to stick with Sumica I have been using it for so long no clue on a full name.
<quill9293> hehe yeah
<Hogia> 12Paint STILL doesn't let me zoom in as much as I need to. >_>
<quill9293> i'll probably end up shipping my sona to dash, being the horrible fan boy that i am :P
<Sumica> lol
<sotha> It isn't too bland if you've read Last Man Standing.
<quill9293> ahh

<Sumica> meowception?
<sotha> YES! I spanished correctly. (just without accents). /)*3*(\

<quill9293> i can see that quite clearly...
<quill9293> @hunty btw

<quill9293> ...who is into the sock meme... i have read a disturbing fic by butterscotch sundae about teh socks and now... it makes me cringe
<sotha> I thought it would be quite clear, since I can see it so well from here
<Sumica> Holy lag.
*sotha tries to stay away from disturbing things that may tarnish her associations with things.
<hunty> 0im sorry i dont understand, explain the meaning at hand?
<hunty> 0look at my back
<hunty> 0LOOK AT IT!
<sotha> Just what kind of party was that anyway?

<sotha> yeah . . . but with cosplaying? at the library. . .

<drfsupercenter> 03all we can get
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, yeah, it's still a bit upscaled
<quill9293> like whit
<junh1024-XD> anything can be resized to any resolution.
<drfsupercenter> 03but it looks better than that Blu-Ray of movies 5 and 7 I think XD

<Hogia> 12o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03Hogia is a bree now?

<junh1024-XD> FIAL
<Drake> 04sure Hogia
<Hogia> 12:>
<sotha> It's okay. We pretty much finished with it.
<Sumica> I was big in to magic at one point but the card games now just leave me with a bit of huhwah.
<sotha> anyway
<sotha> huhwah?
<Sumica> huh+what
<Sumica> in other words a stupid look of i don't get it on my face.
<sotha> oh okay.
<sotha> I just have a passion for games (though that mainly applies to board games). I am currently in various stages of designing a spy-themed card game, which is looking pretty cool with what little progress I have made on it so far.
<Sumica> nice
<Sumica> So what do you all do for a living if any thing?
<hunty> 0im a medic
<sotha> also: a tbs strategy table top game based on a hex grid, an economics themed board game, and various abstract strategy games.
<hunty> 0US army medic
<sotha> I'm going to school to be a chemical engineer. That's as far as I've gotten so far.
<hunty> 0going to be a doctor when i get out
<Caaz> Oh yes, finally got it to work
<sotha> TBS strategy was a tad redundant. I apologise. Let's sing the S O N G C A M P F I R E Song now!
<quill9293> well i am going through collage to learn the trade of writer, i am hioping to make something peopkle will enjoy but i guess thats what most writers hope :)
<Caaz> Would help if I didn't forget that NEWLINES EXIST.
<Drake> 04wat
<sotha> What do you enjoy writing right now?
<Caaz> Basically, "Press enter to send text"
<hunty> 0write my little pony friendship is magic! that should be a good idea
<hunty> 0ill bet itll be really sucessfull too
<Sumica> Well I was a draftsman back in LA but when I moved to vegas I decided to try being a Chef.
<Armageddon> fuck yeah, IPv6 rdns working
<Armageddon> and dinner
<hunty> 0hows being a chef going?
<Drake> 04You have dinner early.
<Drake> 04Cya
<sotha> Just go back in time. I mean, considering how screwed up the Whole Sort of General Mish-Mash is, it shouldn't be too difficult.
<Sumica> I like it. Besides it alws me to tolorate being around a computer at home.
<sotha> But then again, it shouldn't be too difficult to get to Equestria either if we go off of that premise, so...
<hunty> 0thats good, what do you work as? like position?
<Sumica> Working on a computer all day for a living made me not want to be near one at all for play.
<Drake> 0460kb/s
<Drake> 04kill me
<hunty> 0tell me about it
<hunty> 0before i was a medic, i worked as a IT professional
<sotha> I hope Quill is drafting some sort of HUGE response to this.
<Sumica> Sous chef main kitchen at the venetian
<hunty> 0could not stand computers by the time quit
<sotha> ooh cool Sumica
<hunty> 0oooh
<hunty> 0thats coool :D
<sotha> my thoughts exactly.
<sotha> XD
<quill9293> sorry hunty i was reading, but i greatly enjoy writing fantasy, thats probably the rthing that attaracted me to fim, its so well imagined, lauren faust is my hero ^^
<Ascendant> Drake
<sotha> Lauren Faust is a super hero after all.
<Ascendant> I'm at 7kb/s
<Ascendant> kill me
<Drake> 04How do you LIVE
<Ascendant> my bloody bro ate all my bandwidth
<sotha> I write poetry, but find it difficult to write stories and other things.
<Drake> 04._.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03you at home right now Ascendant?
<Sumica> What was realy cool was back in school I ended up having to do a report on a chef of my picking. Well I always love iron chef even as a kid. so i wrote Masaharu Morimoto for more infomation about him.
<hunty> 0super hero :D
<sotha> ooooh Yes Masaharu Morimoto
<sotha> original Iron Chef is best Iron Chef.
<hunty> 0hey speaking of which, how did you people get into ponies?
<Sumica> He was so flattered that he flew me out to new york to interview him in person and try out his favorite meals
<sotha> wow
<sotha> really?
<Sumica> yeah
<sotha> That is amazing.
<Chimera> Ascendant
<sotha> I now have more respect for him.
<Chimera> HOW
<Chimera> .-.
*Drake steps on Chime
<Ascendant> yes
<Ascendant> now dinner
<drfsupercenter> 03:<
<drfsupercenter> 03k
<Sumica> Youtube got me hooked it kep poping up in my recomended videos the pmv's and such. so after watching a few I decided to check out the eps
<hunty> 0nice
<hunty> 0brb
<Chimera> Nu
<Chimera> Also
<hunty> 0theres silent hill fog outside
*Chimera squish
<hunty> 0and I MUST GO KILL BAT THINGS
<Sumica> mind you I did it in the dead of night in the dark with every one asleep.
<hunty> 0and get raped by pyramid head
<quill9293> heh
<Dashite> Original Iron Chef is pretty good, but dammit, I like Mario Batali too much to say the original series is better.
<Dashite> And I don't remember what prompted me to first start watching the show, but I do recall I just sat down and watched everything that was out over the course of about 3 nights.
<quill9293> how i got into ponies...well mine was not really to special
<Sumica> this was the first pmv I ever saw.
<sotha> Well, I was drawn into FiM by a couple different sources. In the only chat I really spent much any time on regularly pre-event, there was a particular person who made ponified pictures of various video game and movie characters, which got me interested because they looked amazing, but for some reason, I never checked it out.
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tjb14VoWjg
*Hogia 12falls on Ascendant
<Chimera> Sleep
<Chimera> Night
*Chimera sleeps under Drake's foot :P
<Sumica> ah the whole meme's made me do it?
<quill9293> a friend of mine and his boyfriend told me about the show and we watched an episode or two at their house, and a few pmvs, such as 1000 subscribes, it took a few days, but slowly i realised i wanted to try watching the show again...i watch the whwole season in one day, twice
<sotha> And then, in a different forum I'm a part of, a thread called "Twenty Percent Cooler" popped up for pony-meme images and stuff, which I found funny, and became more interested. And then when I was skyping one of my friends from said forum, he asked me who my favourite pony was, and since I couldn't answer him until I actually looked into it . . .
<Sumica> I had been asking my self for months before I even was geting the yt videos what is up with all the ponies
<sotha> . . . I watched the first episode, and then the second, and so on. And then I found EqD.
<quill9293> ahh the anthology, i love that vid
<sotha> And my heart, mind, life, and soul were all officially taken over by pony.
<quill9293> eqd was easy enough for me to find, the friend s i told you about and their roomates all love the show, so yeah it was pretty easy to become hooked,
<Sumica> I think that vido is one of the best ways to get people hooked or at least get them started down the path.
<sotha> I never watched the whole thing.
<Sumica> it's realy well done.

<sotha> pocket ponies?
<Sumica> I think it had somthing to do with the tags taht got it sent to me.
<quill9293> after all this time on the fandom...a question still elludes me...why in the hay do sooo many people like trixie!!!! my god i just find her so...damn ANNOYING... okay im done now, she is cute though...
<Sumica> partly cause I watched somthing called AMV hell
<Sumica> I dont mind her when she dosent have the whole I am great act going one.
<Sumica> Like some one said tonight she dosent seem bad without the hat and cape.
<quill9293> which is the whole time she was in the episode...
<quill9293> that would be me...
<quill9293> like i said... she is cute
<sotha> I think the majority of ponies who like her like her for the personality the fandom created for her, rather than her in-show one.
<Sumica> could be, then again the community at large seems to be shaping alot of the show.
<sotha> I think that has to do with the fact that there right now is no show.
<Sumica> I said shapeing not shiping mind you.
<Sumica> well derpy for example.

*SilverSonic is sleepy
<Vaporeon> 12How are you today Hogia?
<Sumica> was fine for 12 or so eps then became the crosseyed version as part of canon.
<quill9293> hm
<sotha> I mean, that as there is no source material to work from, the community is self-propagating the effects it is having on the direction it is taking everything, and hopefully this should be reined in a little (ha ha reined in) when S2 airs.
<Sumica> ah yeah I see what you meen
<quill9293> whhich is soon i hope...i've run out of fan fics i actually like...and im starting to go insane...
<Hogia> 7good.
<Sumica> Chalk it up to artistic licensing.
<Vaporeon> 12That's good :)
<quill9293> brb
<sotha> I just hope that they don't modify the show because of things in the fan community to any extent greater than they have with Derpy. And they could have Lyra and Bon bon together, and so on.
<Hogia> 7I like pickles.
<Sumica> Yeah i like it more as shoutouts to the fans in the background.
<Vaporeon> 12Pickles taste good
<sotha> just little details.
<eXAKR> Pickles.
<sotha> nothing that actually changes the show.
<Sumica> still might be intersting to see BG ponies get a line from time to time. Or atleast not be background such as lyra and bonbon in the parasprites one.

<Sumica> There was a bit of shiping in cross and arrow....ok alot of shipping and well it was strange.
<Caaz> Which would be kind of difficult to prove I guess.
<Sumica> mostly cause it was rule 63 shipping.

<Dman> Ohai Bronies
<Rodman> I think everybrony left
<Dman> Ohey Rodman!
<Dman> I just woke up myself. well, about 2 hours ago, but just came here
<Dman> also, our video : >200 views
<Rodman> I know
<Rodman> went to see it just now
<Dman> just.wat.
<Rodman> Oh, and Seth replied to me
<Dman> what have we unleashe
<Dman> OH GOD
<Dman> WHATHESAYWHATHESAYWHATHESAY
<Dashite> YFW I'm always here...
<Rodman> We've unleashed an unspeakable evil upon the internets
<Rodman> He said this:
<Rodman> Haha yep. There are trixie and fluttershy ones too. Cereal posted it primarily as a joke. I'm not sure if is do more Hah. Sent from my phone! Ignore the typos!
<Dman> ohai Dashite, mfw you're afk though sometimes
<Dman> so what he say, Rodman
<Rodman> Hi Dashite
<Dman> oh that's what he said?
<Dman> ...there's trixie and fluttershy?
<Dman> link
<Rodman> ^^^^^thats what he said
<Dashite> Pfft. I'm here almost as much as Dari.
<Rodman> It seems so, though I've been unable to find them
<Dman> and dari is also afk half the time. you're not HERE here, so why be here?
<Dman> Dari actually has his colour kicking script to keep, so he has a reason
<Dashite> Because it's easier to just leave mIRC running than it is to start it up again all the time?
<Dman> i can't find them either Rodman
<Dman> start it up? just go to bronystate.co.cc
<Rodman> My little Metro?
<Dashite> I don't use the website except to watch the stream.
<Rodman> I don't think I've seen that one

*Rodman has made arrangements to be here tonight
<Ascendant> ):

<Drake> 04Well you were trying to imitate NS so...
<Rodman> Well, now I got no excuse to miss next week
<Ascendant> What happens if I'm a guy though?

<lightumbreon> 06drak would ragequit
<Dman> I actually read 'now i got an excuse' and was all D:, but the reread. whew.
<Ascendant> ohai Kyu
<Rodman> Except I'm moving to the dorms, but that will take little time and the stream starts after the time I'd do anything related to that
<Dman> I might ask silverscreen if I can play my versions (i have extended) with commentary on and post some super duper neato trivia!
<Drake> 04Probably not
<Rodman> Oh nice!
<Dman> well i think 7PM EST
<Dman> i must ask him though, he may want to do trivia on his own (Which would mean only IMDB trivia, and not super duper neato commentary trivia)
<Dman> you seen the extended editions?
<Rodman> :V
<Rodman> Yeah
*Dman is a big fan of Lotr =]
<Rodman> Hey, you got to see this
<Rodman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmaGcYf0IpI

<EpicStatsGuy> School bitches.

<Drake> 04Stupid goddamn router
<Dman> doesn't help i was educated in UK and did /very/ well adn they were all raised in Spain with it's crap educational system . : ( sadface
<Dman> basicaly UK > Spain for education. this is fact. i was in spain a few years myself, before UK
<Dman> what bout you? where are you in life? school? job?
<Ascendant> [20:27:20] <~Dragonite> I promise I won't rape you
<Ascendant> [20:27:22] <~Dragonite> ...too hard
<Drake> 04...
<Drake> 04wat
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> Drake
<Ascendant> I'm sooooooo sad
<Ascendant> I'm still trying to decide
<Ascendant> What I'll do when Reminiscence is finished
<Ascendant> ;-;
<EspyLacopa> Wow, a Luna-centric fanfic with Steven Magnet.
<lightumbreon> 06marry drake, get children, and die happily after 60 years
*lightumbreon RUNBS
<Dman> Lol
<Dman> and ohai EspyLacopa
<Rodman> Me? University
<Rodman> 1 year of Chinese, and about to start 4 in career
<Ascendant> Drake != Reminiscence
<Drake> 04no
<Drake> 04just
<Drake> 04no
<Rodman> And dear God, finally I finished that hell
<Drake> 04>|
<Ascendant> imo characters of Reminiscence are so much better than its plotline
<Dman> nice! i wish i could speak chinese
<Ascendant> but its plotline is also somewhat interesting
<Ascendant> I think
<Dman> uhm.....xie xie?
<Drake> 04premise is good
<Ascendant> premise? lol
<Dman> xi ne quae le or something?
<Drake> 04execution leaves some things wanting
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Rodman> Why are you thanking me?
<Drake> 04...ignore the grammar
<Ascendant> XD
<Dman> thanking? i said NICE cuz that's awesome!
<Dman> oh right
<Dman> sorry i don't know chinese
<Dman> i was just quotinga ll i knew xD
<Rodman> I really can't tell what you're seeing without tones placed ontop of the words
<Rodman> Thats the kicker
<Ascendant> <Drake> execution leaves some things wanting
<Ascendant> what'd you mean by that though? :p
<Dman> sowwee
<Rodman> Four tones: One steady and neutral, one quick and hard, one rising but slow, and one continuously low
<Drake> 04The execution of the plot leaves you wondering what the hell happened
<Dman> you know yer Chinese =]
<Drake> 04And the basic setting of it is rather...lackluster
<Drake> 04Swords in the futute/modern day?
<Ascendant> It's kinda disorganized I know >:
<Ascendant> plotholes left and right
<Ascendant> that's why I'm going to rewrite it
<Ascendant> so therefore I have another 2 yaers
<Ascendant> ears
<Ascendant> years
<Drake> 04ears
<Rodman> I tell you, I can read a story (somewhat) and understand whats going on, and make an essay on agriculture
<Drake> 04wow
<Ascendant> .____,.
<Drake> 04that
<Drake> 04just
<Rodman> But I can't speak worth a damn because nobody understands me
<Drake> 04I don't know what to say really
<Rodman> :V
<Ascendant> shut up
<Ascendant> Anyway
<Ascendant> imo the stuff that goes on mightn't make sense
<Ascendant> but most of it should
<Ascendant> at least the non-basic stuff
<Drake> 04Yeah
<Dman> : /
<Drake> 04Seran gets turned, Lyon angsts, The Kommander, Hensh and all the DMs are annoying manipulaters and deadpan snarkers
<RobotPinkie> lol oh good morning

<Dman> well i guess i'm alright. i'm gonna comb Fluttershy's hair as a testrun today
<Ascendant> haha Drake
<Drake> 04oxymoron's ftw
<Dman> power outage? y/day?
<Ascendant> <Drake> Seran gets turned, Lyon angsts, The Kommander, Hensh and all the DMs are annoying manipulaters and deadpan snarkers
<Ascendant> The Hensh

<Ascendant> or Rathicus and The Hensh
<Ascendant> :D
<Drake> 04Oh yes
<Ascendant> ...I'm not even sure if I could tolerate that.
<Ascendant> Drake actually
<Ascendant> Dyan vs The Hensh
<Drake> 04hEH
<Drake> 04No one really knows what Dyan's like
<Drake> 04No one's actually read how he talks actually
<Ascendant> That's why we both read it
<Drake> 04except people in the DRP
<Ascendant> er
<Ascendant> write it
<Drake> 04and that's not a very good representation of it
<Ascendant> You write Dyan
<Ascendant> I write The Hensh
<Ascendant> ???
<Ascendant> PROFIT
<Drake> 04lolsure

<RobotPinkie> This will not end well!
<Dman> lol, i always just pick another pony and say IT'S the best one, but really I like them all :3
<RobotPinkie> So were there any clips where you'd like the characters isolated from the BG?
<Dman> not really, but haven't looked really. Why, you want to vector aginz?
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, though I think I'm gonna amend my "mane 6 is best pony" to "all ponies but blueblood, snips and snails are best pony"
<Dman> true dat
<Dman> also, why the Gilda hate? D:
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, either vector or cut out?
<RobotPinkie> We don't have to do anything this weekend, really :P
<Ziltoid> Gilda is worst griffon

<Espeon> 06:3
<Dman> yes
<Dman> crossbreeze is now a moderator
<Dman> and do you know about next week's LOTR marathon?
<Espeon> 06of course, when Skylands does it it'll become "Skylands's" but this is an improvement anyway :P
<Ziltoid> Yup
<lightumbreon> 06thanks alot!
<Dman> today during lotto 6 draws will be had to determine the 2 per night FIM episodes
*lightumbreon huggles Ascendant
<Ziltoid> Guess I dint get picked for mod lol
<Drake> 04o-o
<RobotPinkie> Also they announced silence for about 5 minutes, not sure what that was about. :P
<Dman> they're only announcements, other than 'still looking for mods' and 'if you could stream season 2 contact us'
<Ascendant> o-o
*Ascendant hugs back

<RobotPinkie> What? They had a quiz or something?
<Dman> D: how so?
<Dman> yea what did they do / ask?
<Ziltoid> I dont know if I should say
<RobotPinkie> I guess not, lol
<Ziltoid> Ill keep it a secret
<lightumbreon> 06makes sense
<Ziltoid> spoilers cupcakes
<Dman> yea actually it would be a possible unfair advantage
<Drake> 04I want
<Drake> 04to kill my sister now
<Dman> ohey RobotPinkie were you also applying for a position as a moderator?
<RobotPinkie> Not yet

<RobotPinkie> I might if they don't get enough, I guess?
<Dman> not yet? :P
<Dman> you so should :3
<RobotPinkie> lol I dunno, I've been a mod before in various places

<Dman> i don't even care about anything like dat lol.
<RobotPinkie> lolol not on anything big, communities about this size

<Dman> i actually am considering changing bronystate name to Daz, but ppl might forget i am Dman :(
<RobotPinkie> It's not even that, it's just nothing major that I've been a mod on. The only big thing about being a mod is you get to be in on the secret chats/forums
<Dman> i suppose
<RobotPinkie> It's not like... a major change from anything

<drf|away> 02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<Dman> well, from what i've seen, here it's all aobut keeping steam / fb updated, rules kept here, money issues for website, streaming of course, and i guess you get to have colours
<Ray> 02Annnd... I just woke up .-.
<Dman> saw dat in EQD iltoid - would NOT watch
<Dman> Ziltoid *
<RobotPinkie> Saw what?
<Ziltoid> I am very scared
<Ray> 021:40pm ... this what I get for going to sleep at 4am
<lightumbreon> 06ohai Ray
<Dman> the picture i saw before, RobotPinkie, and lol Ziltoid
<Ray> 02Hiii~ Light
<lightumbreon> 06TF2 is ready, but i may be off soon
<lightumbreon> 06iPad it's home button broke >:
<Ray> 02D:
<lightumbreon> 06going to get a new one, already got the insurance papers here
<Ray> 02ah, I see
<RobotPinkie> Yeah it disappeared for me...
<Dman> ack! RobotPinkie what browser you use?
<Ray> 02well, I just woke up. but meh I'd play anyways
<Ray> 02Just tell me when you want to play :P
<RobotPinkie> Firefox right now
<RobotPinkie> until I get themes to work in Chrome :P
<Dman> ah. well, in chrome this extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nonjdcjchghhkdoolnlbekcfllmednbl?hc=search&hcp=main means that NOT ONE PICTURE EVER has disappeared for me
<Ziltoid> Yeah cant even see what I posted
<Dman> ...RobotPinkie, get chrome right now, and i'll try to help if you want ^_^
<Dman> Ziltoid, i can : ( get chrome and that extension right there
<Ziltoid> I dont like Chrome
<RobotPinkie> Um, I just want pony themes, but I can't switch between them in Chrome...
<Dman> okie then
<RobotPinkie> There's no theme switcher yet
<Dman> and RobotPinkie you can, so uh yea, but eh u can stick with firefox ; )
<Dman> yea there's no 'switcher'
<Dman> but you can reobtain the themes to switch. takes 2 seconds
<Dman> i don't actually mind which you use, just a little upset that people often see images disappear and I dont :(
<RobotPinkie> Naw, links get deactivated once a theme is installed
<Dman> hmm. works for me. ah well =]
<Dman> soo what you gunna do till movie night? gonna go out or something?
<RobotPinkie> It switches from "download" to "already installer" or something
<RobotPinkie> Not sure, maybe I'll watch some ponies... or style Pinkie? :P
<Dman> yea RobotPinkie but if you install another one that one will be back again. i think.
<Dman> and style!!1
<RobotPinkie> It's not for me, that's what annoys me...
<RobotPinkie> Because I installed my favorite theme first, then installed a bunch of others thinkin I could switch :P
<RobotPinkie> They've added theme switching to the testing branch, though, so I'll switch fairly soon.
<RobotPinkie> for now I'm stuck here in firefox land, missing half the images in bronystate :P
<Dman> ah okie
<Dman> well i dunno wat do today : /
<Dman> also viewing amnesia now! : D

<Dermathil> *gamer
<GGgala> it is so weird that a new 3d Legend of Zelda is coming out for the Wii just as the Wii's replacement is about to come out. It's like Twilight Princess and the GameCube all over again
<Ziltoid> You play as death in DC2 right?
<RobotPinkie> Yep Ziltoid

<RobotPinkie> oh wait, DC?
<Dman> RobotPinkie, WiiU has graphical capabilities > PS3. I ain't saying durr nintendofanboy look we're better, it HAS been 6 years since last homeconsole, but yea, wiiu if done rite can have better graficx
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Dman> GGgala i no, but at least wiiu not till next year and skyward sword this christmas ! :3

<RobotPinkie> I'm not sure Wii U has better graphical capabilities, but okay.
<Dman> i do too!
<Dman> 'durr controller is spaz' no u! all ps and xbax controllers the SAME! ERRY ninty controller always different, and always works :3
<RobotPinkie> I hear it's pretty much on par with 360 and PS3 since the controller will cost a lot to manufacture
<GGgala> RobotPinkie: the iPhone has better graphics capabilities than the ps3 at this point. believe me, it will
<Dman> eh i ain't buying yet, gonna see what's actually for it
<RobotPinkie> lol fanboys
<GGgala> doesn't mean the ps4, or xbox 720, won't blow Wii U out of the water in turn
<Pegacorn> Ohai everypony!
<Dman> GGgala, in graphics yes
<RobotPinkie> If you want to say iPhone has better graphics capabilites than 360 or PS3, than provide a link :P
<Dman> but to be honest, GGgala, it's all about style and gameplay now, cuz graphics are so good

<Quanyails> 7I'm hoping you're correct about what you're saying and that I'm not misunderstanding it.
<GGgala> alien ponies from space?
<RobotPinkie> Damn, now I need to watch that movie again
<Dman> i watch this movie at least once a month, i can't get bored of it. the story is so simliar ot mine i resonate with it very well, and that obviously helps in making it my favourite movie. I love the music, still laugh at it's jokes, and every watch reminds me of everything that's ever happend in my life. Yea, it's my fave movie
<Ascendant> what?
<Dman> RobotPinkie i was thinking of making it a movie choice but some may get bored
<Dman> also >implying i'll ever get picked
<Quanyails> 7By saying 'god', you imply that Espeon has idled for an absurdly long amount of time, right?
<RobotPinkie> wat?
<Dman> lotto >_<
<GGgala> why would they get bored tho?
<Dman> ghosties has had 2 picks so far lul

<RobotPinkie> I can accept that.
<Dman> shame on y'all! Colgate!
<Dman> b'sides, everypony knows Luna is best
<Barry> I guess Rainbow will do as a second choice, with Cheerilee as a third
<RobotPinkie> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/arch/src/130692387579.png
<Dman> I mean, how is doctor whooves NOT the best?
<Dman> it's so obviously celestia
<Barry> huh?
<Dman> and that's why applebloom is the best pony
<GGgala_> i agree with everything Dman just said!
<Barry> You keep switching between different ponies
<Dman> GGgala_, ya darn right
<RobotPinkie> Twilestishy Diane Cake is best pony
<RobotPinkie> also best ship
*Ziltoid comes back to see best pony discussion
<GGgala_> this argument is flawless
<Pegacorn> I'm back.
<Dman> hey Pegacorn
<Dman> ohey Ziltoid
<Ziltoid> Obviously sluttershy is best pony
<RobotPinkie> Okay lets settle this once and for all
<Ziltoid> Fluttershy*
<Barry> Wait, you're saying the best ship is Twilight x Celestia x Fluttershy x Pinkie Pie x Mr/Mrs Cake?
<Dman> nah, it's actually sweetie belle, the derail master
<Pegacorn> Dash.End.
<RobotPinkie> @pony Best pony
<RobotPinkie> Best pony is Gilda
<Barry> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<RobotPinkie> Done.
<GGgala_> @pony Sluttershy
<GGgala_> oh right, no Steven
<Pegacorn> Gilda not be pony.
<Dman> So as you can all clearly see, big macintosh is best pony
<RobotPinkie> Prince Blueblood?
<RobotPinkie> imokaywiththis.jpg
<Ziltoid> NOPE
<Barry> hell no
<Pegacorn> Gilda IS cool though,in the same sense that Francis from L4D is cool.
<Ziltoid> more like worst pony
<RobotPinkie> trolololo
<Barry> best ship is Rainbow Dash x anyone
<Dman> yea, RD gets shipped with erryone
<Pegacorn> Dunno why.
<RobotPinkie> Best pony is everypony except Snips, Snails & Prince Blueblood
<Barry> second best is Pinkie Pie x anyTHING

<Quanyails> 7Did you see it?
<Pegacorn> Gilda x Francis anypony?
<Pegacorn> lol
<RobotPinkie> lololol
*Dermathil has fond memories of treasure planet.
<Dman> >mfw errypony is actually best pony. protip: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/10.jpg It's my face.
<RobotPinkie> Though I'd add Twist and some other ponies to the list of "not best pony"
<Pegacorn> Francis is best survivor.
<Dman> >mfw reports on bronies still say we like the show cuz we're all SOB's from 4chan doing it for the irony. http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/125.png :(
<RobotPinkie> all the NICE ponies are best pony
<Dman> ^
<Espeon> 06now I did
<Pegacorn> Hunter is best infected.
<RobotPinkie> yeah and that it's "/b/ + ponies"
<RobotPinkie> How the fuck is /b/ + ponies bronies?
<Quanyails> 7Okay. :3
<Dermathil> RobotPinkie, that's the origin of the word.
<Rodman> Because it has the letter b in it
<Dman> "they like ponies. they file in to stay off from work to watch a show for girls. they mentally stick. they 4channers. They-" :(
<Rodman> Some say its /b/ + ponies
<Dermathil> That's because /b/ usually uses bro as their word.
<Dman> it's never ever been /b/ + ponies, it's bros and ponies
<GGgala_> RobotPinkie: >implying The Great And Powerful TRIXIE is not best pony
<Rodman> Others say its simply bro + ponies
<Dermathil> Same way that /co/ were /co/lts
<Dman> Rodman: it's 2nd one clearly :P
<Rodman> Inorite
<Pegacorn> Trixie is now a charger.Deal with it.
<RobotPinkie> GGgala_ >implying Trixie is not a nice pony
<GGgala_> RobotPinkie: >iimplying she was ever nice
<Dermathil> /b/+ponies=/b/ronies. That's how it has been due to the 4chan roots of the fandom.
<Dermathil> (the fandom originally formed on co and moved to B. that's how it was.
<GGgala_> i remember at one point the term was /co/lts. but bronies took over
<RobotPinkie> If you say so
<Ray> 02well, bbl
<Ray> 02Back in 1 to 4 hours :D
<Dermathil> Knowyourmeme article written by bronies state as such.
<RobotPinkie> and Trixie IS nice
<Dman> (moved to b cuz co banned it, and then b banned it so made ponychan. they 'one thread at a time' rule for co and b)
<RobotPinkie> she just has a bigger ego than Kanye West
<RobotPinkie> she can't help it
<Pegacorn> Trixie?Nice?Nope.avi
<Dman> wanttosee trixie season 2

<RobotPinkie> Haha
<RobotPinkie> lol who said that, GGgala_?
<Dman> eyup

<Dman> AllisZero, hanging with bronies, learning to draw, rewatching, MANY MANY PMVS and MANY MANY MUSIC
<Barry> So, the new season will start on September?

<Pegacorn> RAINBOW DASH IS A BLOODEH SPY!

<AllisZero> Gotcha, screaming and hollering.

<GGgala_> specifically, the movie's called Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRnSnfiUI54
*GGgala_ has never seen any Star Trek movie, but has seen endless "Khaaan" references in other things
<Pegacorn> Many MANY other things.
*Dermathil presses his KHAN button
<Dman> KHAAAAAAAAAAAAN FAUND THEM
<GGgala_> from Seinfeld to Family Guy.
<Pegacorn> And Nostalgia Critic.
<RobotPinkie> The "Khan" thing is funny in the original movie for two reasons. One: Khan can't hear him when he shouts it. and Two: Everything is going according to Kirk's plan, so he has no reason to shout
<RobotPinkie> It's just really stupid
<GGgala_> The many wraths of Khan: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfD143wa2qc

<Dman> brushie!
<RobotPinkie> so how many hours until "Creating account..." goes away?
<Dman> lol
<AllisZero> I think it's more than just ponies
<RobotPinkie> If only I'd sent my account details via Rainbow Dash, it'd be done in 10 seconds flat
<RobotPinkie> Well... G4 ponies...
<Dman> :3
<AllisZero> I concur
<AllisZero> Rofl, her hair asploded
<RobotPinkie> The entire team behind FiM is just awesome
<Quanyails> 7So, might anyone set it to music and upload it on YouTube or whatnot?
<Espeon> 06I dunno what you meant with remixing the music though o.o
<RobotPinkie> "Creating account..."? Are you shitting me, Valve?
<Quanyails> 7Replacing the 'nyan's with, say, the Espeon sound effect from the game. :P
<RobotPinkie> Time for some ponies before I ragequit the internet
<RobotPinkie> FOREVERRRRRRRRRRR
<Espeon> 06Lol
<Dman> still?
<AllisZero> ADORABLE PONYTRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIN
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, still
<RandomExtra> That happened to me when I tried to install steam.
<RobotPinkie> I'm starting to think something is wrong...
<AllisZero> Okay shit
<RandomExtra> Turns out, the account had finished being created before the "Creating account" Thing went away
<AllisZero> I'm only watching the last episode tomorrow night
<RobotPinkie> oh my fuck, pouty face rarity :3
<AllisZero> I'd rather be a depressive mule during the week than ruin another weekend
<RandomExtra> Try logging in through the website to see if it's already been created.
<RobotPinkie> okay, RandomExtra, thx
<Barry> Hallo everyone

<Dermathil> I dunno why
<Espeon> 06<3
<Dman> post eet
<Dman> unless ur on about mine
<Dermathil> your last Rarity picture
<RandomExtra> My computer wasn't good enough to actually run steam though. I ended up having to uninstall it (Though I am trying again)
<Dman> : /
<Dman> well i'm in l4d2 with like 7 fps right now
<RobotPinkie> Not enough space for TF2, FFFF
<RobotPinkie> I've way too many pony pngs, I'm guessing, lol
<Dman> uhm
<Dman> lol
<RobotPinkie> ...nope, steam just can't see how much space i have...
<RobotPinkie> 10GB?
<RobotPinkie> TF2 is 10 fucking gigs? holy jesus
*Dman is bored
<RobotPinkie> I thought you were playing L4D2?
<Dman> left a bit ago
<Dman> as I said, so repeat:, it runs below 10fps for me on this pc
<RobotPinkie> One could say you left it... *puts on sunglasses* ...for dead...
<Dman> i only have them cuz was 7 quid for l4d2 and 1
<Dman> YEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<RobotPinkie> lol oh okay
<RobotPinkie> any other good free to play games?
<Dman> uh dunno there may be but i might not like them : /. i don't really play much, so just try some out i guess
<AllisZero> Whoa that was a crappy bluescreen
<RobotPinkie> might be time to connect my portal 2 copy...
<Dman> yay
<Dman> and um AllisZero we're not all watching what you're watching
<RobotPinkie> lol I think he means he BSOD'd
<RobotPinkie> that still happens in windows?
<AllisZero> It does, but it's kinda rare in Windows 7 these days
<AllisZero> It probably tells me that my overclock isn't as stable as I thought it'd be, is all
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay
<RobotPinkie> Haven't been on Windows much in the last 10 years
<Dman> oh okie
<RobotPinkie> brb, time to connect my PSN and Steam accounts...
<AllisZero> Linux or OSX now?
<AllisZero> Gotta log onto work to check my ESX server, I left some large scripts running last night and I'm afraid I crashed my storage box lul
<AllisZero> brb
<AllisZero> Holy shit, it's still going strong
<AllisZero> 16 hours and only about 300 GB Copied. This is gonna suck big time when monday rolls by

<Chimera> Hi
<EspyLacopa> "Luna has a Chill Day" ...Ah, the hilarity.
<Dman> :P
<RobotPinkie> w00t, now I can play Portal 2 with anyone!
<Barry> 300 out of how many?
<AllisZero> 950
<Barry> damn, that's almost a terrabyte
<AllisZero> Yeah, it's pretty much six years worth of company data
<Barry> ah
<Dman> DELETE DELETE DELETE xD
<AllisZero> I'm moving it from a... single 5400 RPM 1TB drive to a raid 6 array of 12 drives, 16 terabytes total
<Barry> wow
<AllisZero> It's... painful, yeah
<AllisZero> 100 people trying to access files at once is not a pretty sight
<RobotPinkie> ouch
<AllisZero> Yeah, every night I go to bed in fear that single drive is going to fail
<AllisZero> It's all backed up to tape but it's not something I want to go through
<AllisZero> MEANWHILE IN PONYVILLE
<RobotPinkie> I'm also watching ponies while Portal 2 installs...
<RobotPinkie> So now I'm on Steam, I feel cooler already
<AllisZero> Just realized this feels like Inception
<Dman> robotpinkie, add meee
<AllisZero> I'm on a VM, VPNed into the work network, remote desktop into my machine, using ESX to manage another VM
<RobotPinkie> I'm RobotPika on steam
<Dman> managing a vm through a vm? o lol
<AllisZero> I have weird shit on my computer, I prefer to log onto work from a clean VM :(
<Dman> lol
<RobotPinkie> Not Pinkie, Pika :P
<Dman> got it
<Dman> uhm im not in steam
<RobotPinkie> like the tiny adorable lagomorph that will be extinct in 50 years
<Dman> ill add u late r:P
<Dman> pika pika
<RobotPinkie> okay :P

*Barry explodes in a shower of confetti
<RobotPinkie> lolol not like Pikachu, like the pika
<AllisZero> I'm afraid I can't do that, gentlecoat
<Rodman> I never really was on your side *stab*
<AllisZero> Yayayayaya yayaya yayayay
<RobotPinkie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVJuRgil0wQ
<AllisZero> I so want to know what it feels like
<Ziltoid> RODMAN IS A SPY
<AllisZero> To be minding your own business at a traffic light at 2 in the morning
<Rodman> *stab*
<AllisZero> And some weird douche pulls up playing Avast Flutterhsy's Ass loud as fuck
<Ziltoid> Lol
<AllisZero> Yayayayayayayayayy
<Ziltoid> tell him "LOUDER"
<RobotPinkie> lolol are you saying that loud douche is you?
<Barry> With the pronounciation of pika as Paika, that means that Pikachu is actually pronounced Paikachu
<AllisZero> No, I'm the weird douche who's actually playing it is me
<RobotPinkie> well no, Pikachu is something different...
<AllisZero> Or was playing it last night
<AllisZero> Pikachu comes from Pikapika which is sparks of light in wapanese
<AllisZero> (Fucking pokemon trivia what did you do to me)
<Barry> what the heck is wapanese?
<EspyLacopa> White Japanese.
<Barry> oh
<RobotPinkie> 1 hour until I can try to play Portal 2.... hope it works on my PC
<AllisZero> Why has no-one made a Crysis 2 FIM mod yet
<RobotPinkie> otherwise I can still play with PC users from my PS3, yay!
<RobotPinkie> I think the reason is that it takes too much time, and not enough people are cooperating on projects.
<Dman> : /
<Ziltoid> needs more friendship is fighting
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"
<EspyLacopa> Isn't Crysis one of those games that goes for crazy amounts of realistic detail?
<RobotPinkie> just imagine if those 100 different guys who are trying to make a 3D adventure did something together :P
<Dman> O lool wow RobotPinkie
<Ziltoid> yeah pretty much
<AllisZero> Pretty much
<EspyLacopa> That would require an organizer of Twilight Sparkle quality to accomplish.
<RobotPinkie> Myup
<AllisZero> Aye, but at the same time
<Nick> hey skylandser
<AllisZero> Copyright claims up their asses if anyone tried to be organized about it
<Nick> or should I say SL
*Nick flees!
<EspyLacopa> And then you get into. . .*shudder*. . .beuracracy.
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, Hasbro has been very nice about fan creations thus far
<Skylands> 10Skylander > SL
<Dman> sure has ; )
<Dman> boy am I glad though
<EspyLacopa> Not even the red tape of copywrite claims, but rather internal beurocracy.
<EspyLacopa> That is inherent of having that many people all working together.
<AllisZero> Yep
<EspyLacopa> You'd probably have more luck with a smaller team, maybe 4-6 people.
<Espeon> 06!shipping
<Skylands> 4 Espeon is paired with Freyskol
<Espeon> 06lag
<AllisZero> You need more NEETs with amazing skills, kinda like the japanese do
<RobotPinkie> Need more people who can do 3D assets, most of all...
<RobotPinkie> maybe I should try to do that... Hmmmm
<RobotPinkie> though the guys who are making the online thing have pretty good artists working on it
<Angel_Espeon> 13!shipping
<Skylands> 4 Angel_Espeon is paired with Freyskol
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Espeon> 06it's telling us something
<RobotPinkie> ...can't watch ponies while Portal 2 is installing... FFFFFFFF-
<AllisZero> I'M GONNA LOVE AND TOLERATE THE SHIT OUT OF YOU
<AllisZero> best meme
<Anthony> ssh!
<Anthony> the voice speaks to me..
<Dman> good meme
<Dman> RobotPinkie ya can't?
<Nick> *the voice* Anthony you must give Nick 20 dollars...*
<AllisZero> You sure you can actually... play portal two too?
<RobotPinkie> Naw, ponies in HD.... install is taking a surprising amount of horsepower
<RobotPinkie> lolol horse
<Anthony> ....
<Anthony> the voice...
<Anthony> the voice is a greasy hobo ):
*Anthony runs
<AllisZero> lul
<RobotPinkie> Not sure Portal 2 will work, but eh, it's worth a try
<RobotPinkie> that way I won't have to switch to my PS3 to get my fix
<RobotPinkie> Holy fuck Steam is fast to download from.
<Chimera> XD
<AllisZero> Yeah, that it is
<Chimera> Also skyyyy
<AllisZero> Alright, time to get my hooves dirty
<AllisZero> And go paint a picture of fluttershy
<AllisZero> But since I suck at drawing animals, I'll make her human
<RobotPinkie> searched google images for "best pony", first FiM result that comes up......
<RobotPinkie> http://fim.413chan.net/art/src/129882304302-the-best-pony.jpg
<RobotPinkie> Oh yeah, it's settled, fillies!
<AllisZero> Fluttershy
<RobotPinkie> That's not Fluttershy, though I do agree that Fluttershy is one of the best ponies
<Dman> who drew dat?
<Dman> just someone?
<RobotPinkie> no clue
<RobotPinkie> Pretty much, it's not very good
<RobotPinkie> but it IS Pinkie
<Dman> who is also best pony
<AllisZero> Well shit, I can recognize Pinkie... it's alright
<Dman> yes, ALSO and BEST in same sentence :P
<RobotPinkie> lol
<RobotPinkie> Mane 6 is best pony
<RobotPinkie> and close second is CMC
<AllisZero> They're all great
<RobotPinkie> /)^3^(\
<Skylands> 10Chimewww
<Dman> but but luna and celestia!
<AllisZero> Want to bet Luna is gonna soar in popularity when she appears more often?
<AllisZero> She just has potential to be so adorable
<Dman> YES! i want this to be so
<RobotPinkie> That's true.... Luna is also best pony
<Dman> not celestia?
<RobotPinkie> Trollestia is best old mare
<RobotPinkie> trollface.jpg
<Dman> imagine a living breathing world with currency and opinions, and she keeps peace.
<Dman> she has it hard you know :(
<AllisZero> She also has a sharp horn
<RobotPinkie> She's also the most powerful creature in the world, presumably...
<Nick> hey Ecco!
<EccoCode> Greetings Nick and everyone.

<AllisZero> Discuss
<Lakorv> You're the voice, try and understand it.. make some noise and make it real..~
<RobotPinkie> .....no :P
<AllisZero> Awww
<RobotPinkie> I want to headbutt him
<AllisZero> Because Rarity has a crush on him?
<RobotPinkie> Naw, just because he's more self-centered than Trixie
<RobotPinkie> Rarity's crush on him is funny
<AllisZero> Oh wait, is this an episode 26 mention?
<Dman> RobotPinkie: imo she should be as powerful as luna
<AllisZero> I haven't watched it yet
<AllisZero> IF HE SNOBS RARITY
<RobotPinkie> eh?
<AllisZero> I SWEAR I WILL PRINT A CUTOUT OF HIM
<AllisZero> AND TAKE HIM TO THE SHOOTING RANGE
<RobotPinkie> No, she has a crush on him since episode 2 :P
<RobotPinkie> or 3, I guess
<AllisZero> It's 3, yeah
<Lakorv> Oh, we're all someone's daughter.. we're all someone's son.. How long - can we look at eachother.. down the barrel of a gun?
<Dman> snobs? or snogs?
<Dman> or what?
<AllisZero> But you said he's self-centered, but I haven't seen him anywhere else in the show
<RobotPinkie> It's just weird to have a crush one someone you've never even seen :P
<AllisZero> Tell that to the millions of girls in love with Justin Bieber
<RobotPinkie> lolol sorry
<Dman> ep 26
<AllisZero> Yeah, thought he would appear on episode 26
<Dman> and ofc u see him in ep 3
<RobotPinkie> I have a crush on all ponies though
<Dman> Rarity's 'HIM'
<RobotPinkie> so I guess that's weird....
<Dman> RobotPinkie - 0_o you do?
<AllisZero> yeah yeah
<Dman> but they're a different race, and fictional D:
<RobotPinkie> lol no, I guess not really
<Dman> (I say this because I do too and i'm still D; about it )
<EspyLacopa> Blueblood x Trixie?
<RobotPinkie> :O
<AllisZero> I think more real women should be like Fluttershy
<RobotPinkie> >racism
<EspyLacopa> More women with The Stare?
<RobotPinkie> :P
<Dman> ohgodyes
<AllisZero> Uh
<AllisZero> Would you prefer someone who just uses The Stare on dire situations
<RobotPinkie> That's it, they've all just hypnotized me...
<AllisZero> Or someone who uses it for EVERYTHING?

<RobotPinkie> :P
<AllisZero> A crush on their personalities, not their hairy back ends maybe?
<AllisZero> I HAPPEN TO BE AN EXPERT ON 2D ATTRACTION
<RobotPinkie> Well yeah
<Dman> lol
<Lightlugia> 06poof

<RobotPinkie> They're just adowabwe, Dman, that's all
<AllisZero> Yay yayayay ayayayayay

<Dario_daz_mann> Talk, RobotPinkie. You are attracted to their bodies too. lemme hear you say it!
<Dman> Omagad shuddup Dario_daz_mann
<AllisZero> LOLOL 99 bucks for the HP Touchpad
<RobotPinkie> Um, sometimes I look into the mirror and do this
<Dario_daz_mann> huh? what, NO! I WANT YOU TO CONFESS!
*RobotPinkie flexes his muscles "Lookin' good, RP, lookin' DAMN good!"
<AllisZero> I gave up looking at the mirror a long time ago
<Dario_daz_mann> I want you to tell me that you would tap their flanks and are attracted to more than just their personalities!
<RobotPinkie> Um, they all hate your parties and don't want to be your friends anymore?
<Dman> D: y u do dis Dario_daz_mann?
<Dario_daz_mann> Huh? That's not what I said!

*Dario_daz_mann suddenly goes ubersad
<AllisZero> But obviously I'm kinda slow
<Dario_daz_mann> Oh no! RobotPinkie is attracted to fictional characters!
<AllisZero> What do YOU have against people attracted to fictional characters, mister?
<RobotPinkie> Hair goes floomf
<Dman> I have nothing against people, being one of them on certain occasions. It's a perfect world, very well told with much depth in story and characters, and by far a better one than THIS world, so who can blame us? I was just doing a funny sketch with RobotPinkie, is all

<eXAKR|Alt> I managed to get a taste of those Bowers & Wilkins speakers I have been lusting after
<eXAKR|Alt> Great sound but
<eXAKR|Alt> It's too directed to the front
<eXAKR> I need speakers that fill a room with sound, not fill the front of it with sound

*Chimera hugglomps
<RobotPinkie> Yep, Ubuntu
<Dman> if u use linux, then yah firefox is only way to go :P
<RobotPinkie> Not really, Chrome is nice
<RobotPinkie> Opera is pretty nice too :P
<Dman> ilike firefox for ubuntu
<Dman> and opera i don't get y people like it?
<Dman> sure it's good but so are a few others, it's not one of the best
<RobotPinkie> I guess it's a matter of taste
<RobotPinkie> I kinda prefer Chrome to both Firefox and Opera
<Dman> same
<Dman> my fave browsah
<RobotPinkie> but it really bugs me that I can't switch themes in this version...
<RobotPinkie> and in general, plugins are kinda hard to handle
<Dman> http://doctorwhoovescomic.com/wp-content/webcomic/whooves/6.jpg it got updated!
<FreezeFrame> I can't wait for the Doctor to meet Pinkie
<RobotPinkie> Pinkie will look into the heart of the TARDIS.....
<GGgala> >mfw the Doctor was a pony in the first comic page
<Nittany_Tiger> He called me a mule!
<GGgala> wut?
<GGgala> was that a flash-forward?
<Dman> ohai FreezeFrame
<Nittany_Tiger> Mules should be in S2. They have a bone to pick with Rarity.
<Dman> : /
<Dman> i'd prefer they remained a one off joke
<RobotPinkie> GAUNGH GAUNGH GAUNGH GAUNGH
<GGgala> are they still a one off joke if they get used twice?
<RobotPinkie> Perfect sound for Doctor Who...
<Nittany_Tiger> They could get old.
<Dman> ...screw it, i'm feeling down, and not motivated to do shit. :( feelsbadpony. I'm going for a run. C y'all in an hour or so!
<GGgala> there's already a Token Mule in Ponyville. time for another racism episode!
<RobotPinkie> aw, see you in a bit, Dman
<GGgala> ok Dman, cya later, hope you feel better
<Dman> Later RobotPinkie, and thanks GGgala
<Nittany_Tiger> Never seen the mule.
<Nittany_Tiger> Unless it's off-canon.
<GGgala> Nittany_Tiger: watch Applebuck Season.
<Nittany_Tiger> K.
<GGgala> Twilight made an anti-mule joke
<Nittany_Tiger> Racism in a girl's cartoon. :p

<RobotPinkie> You're welcome, dari
<prince-dari> :>
<Angel_Espeon> 13SS, are you doing a show today? Since I know you've had troubles with the RN community recently o-o
<RandomExtra> By the way, apparently there's a new HUB commercial that may contain S2 footage.
<SilverSonic> yes
*PeanutButterWolf types so he isn't the only one idle.
<RobotPinkie> :O
<SilverSonic> its not really with the community as a whole
<RandomExtra> Sorry for posting a link, but here it is if anyone wants to see it http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v134/whimg/?action=view&current=lv09.mp4
<SilverSonic> just the management
<SilverSonic> i've been getting on their case apparently
<prince-dari> You can post links now bro.
<RandomExtra> Oh.
<prince-dari> Outside of our regular stream time.
<SilverSonic> same with ctr, although both him and i havent done anything wrong
<RobotPinkie> omg, I have the bingest woner right now...
<PeanutButterWolf> Season 2: implies Celestia is evil.
<Angel_Espeon> 13If I were you I'd ask what their problem is and if there's a way you can fix it o-o
<RobotPinkie> Very little FiM footage though, but still
<RobotPinkie> I'm desperate for more pony
<SilverSonic> Matt claim's I have a bad attitude
<SilverSonic> :/
*Nick is beggining to make a custom SL desktop wallpaper
<GGgala> prince-dari: see, I told him that... :P
<manazuper> arn't we all
<prince-dari> So what should I stream?
<PeanutButterWolf> Princess Celestia's sexy season 2 eyes were all I needed.
<RobotPinkie> PMVs?
<prince-dari> Sure.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well if they think that, then just do your best to improve this so-called "bad attitude" that they think you have
<Angel_Espeon> 13even though you don't necessarily agree
<SilverSonic> well he also thinks im absolutely rebellious or w/e the spelling of that word is :P
<RobotPinkie> I might play some Portal 2 though.... got it working, finally
<Angel_Espeon> 13Sometimes people get the wrong impression from you and use it as a reason to put you down
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm not saying "you" as in directing at you specifically btw, I mean "you" as in universally :
<prince-dari> Reading through all the EQD stuff I missed now.
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<prince-dari> >3dsforum>
<prince-dari> >now awesome
<Angel_Espeon> 13Silly example, but my sociology teacher thinks I don't enjoy his lessons at all because I don't contribute to class discussion, but really I'm just quiet and prefer to observe and listen instead
<Angel_Espeon> 13So fair enough if he thinks that, but I'm trying to prove him wrong through the quality of the work that I do :B
<RobotPinkie> Now.... slightly cooler.
<prince-dari> Ok.
<prince-dari> Give me a minute to finish reading the EQD articles.
<prince-dari> Then I'll start the stream.
<herospirit> What's the schedule today?
<Chimera> 05mew
<prince-dari> Oh wait.
<prince-dari> How late is it?
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<GGgala> forty-five minutes to stream right?
<prince-dari> Didn't realise it was so close to movie time already.
<prince-dari> XD
<RandomExtra> The Goonies, Cutie Mark Chronicles, Lottery, Buckaroo Banzai, and Boast Busters.
<prince-dari> Nevermind.
<herospirit> Gotcha, so a replay of tomorrow. I missed The Goonies yesterday, so now I get another shot. :D

<prince-dari> Meh, I could do, but it's a bit late.

<Sathi> 7my eyesssss
<prince-dari> How high is the reserve?
<herospirit> RobotPinkie, your name sounds like one of the most dangerous things in the world.
<prince-dari> O_o
<SilverSonic> Minnet: what's my timezone?
<Minnet> Sorry, I don't know you yet. You tell me!
<SilverSonic> xD
<RobotPinkie> That's because I am one of the most dangerous things in the world, herospirit
<RobotPinkie> I am... a pony fanboy...
<GGgala> 'Robot Pinkie' just makes me think of that creepy Pinkie Bubble Machine
<L[a]korv> time for pizza.
<Barry> Hi new people
<Espeon> 06nom
<RobotPinkie> Aw, you never loved me, GGgala :(
<Angel_Espeon> 13I gave up on the lasagne
<Angel_Espeon> 13too hungry to wait for it to defrost
<Angel_Espeon> 13Eating pasta salad instead
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 9 minutes
<herospirit> Oh hai Barry
<Barry> Question, should I upload my newest fic to the Pony fiction archive?
<prince-dari> Is lottery today or was it yesterday?
<L[a]korv> you people are, if you can manage not to abuse the function, free to use the 'my X is ···' command for now
<GeminiSparkle> Doesn't the show start in half an hour?
<RandomExtra> Today I think
<L[a]korv> but please only set relevant information.
<RobotPinkie> It's today
<GGgala> RP! how can you doubt me
<Ghosties> 4Today, dari
<prince-dari> Ok.
<L[a]korv> it can be fetched through 'what is X's $field' or something like that.
<herospirit> Arg, I've got to decide what movies and episodes I want if I win.
<Barry> No movies
<Sathi> 7just eps
<Sathi> 7no movies
<L[a]korv> Minnet: what is Angel_Espeon's character?
<Minnet> Sorry, I don't know that person.
<Chimera> 05I had pizza
<Chimera> 05bagles

*L[a]korv now poofs.
<Chimera> 05were yum :3
<RobotPinkie> 6 eps
<herospirit> Gotcha
<GGgala> episodes as bookends for the movies?
<RobotPinkie> I know which one I'd pick, but I'm not going to win, so....
<SirSprinkles> 6Stream's up.
<Barry> I say it's a pseudo marathon because instead of watching all three movies back to back, we're watching one on Friday, the next on Saturday, and the final on Sunday
<GGgala> ...it is?
*GGgala tried it
<SirSprinkles> 6...CURSE YOU FME!
<herospirit> Not up for me.
<SirSprinkles> 6It gave me an error. One sec.
<herospirit> Let's all laugh at SirSprinkles's pain.

<GGgala> SirSprinkles: but our streams are evenly split between 7pm Eastern and 2pm Eastern...
<Darf14> Hello
<herospirit> This stream is amazing
<RobotPinkie> What is love?
<RobotPinkie> A miserable pile of secrets!
<RobotPinkie> ...wait a sec
<Dermathil> Hello everybrony
<herospirit> What is a Pony?
<herospirit> A miserable little pile of friendship!
<Angel_Espeon> 13I thought you already knew what my character looked like :P
<Sathi> 7cause I will be a zombie at the beginning of the week
<Polarfire> Hey Sprinkles are you at the cafe?
<Angel_Espeon> 13http://xxanimeangelxx.deviantart.com/art/Never-Enough-Espeon-202560197
<SirSprinkles> Did we do the test runs yesterday?
<Darf14> Enough talk have at you!
*Dermathil instantly starts to do neckthrusts. Because neckthrusts are best headbobs.
<Chimera> 05heh
<RobotPinkie> I'm never miserable with ponies.
<Sathi> no their scheduled after the LotR event
<SirSprinkles> Oh, cool.
<Chimera> 05also apparently my sister's dog has sectoral heterochromia
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<SirSprinkles> We did introduce Cross as being hired though, yes?
<Sathi> we need to schedule new interviews
<RobotPinkie> oh ok, Sathi, yeah I can see why :P
<Sathi> yes
<SirSprinkles> I know we do.
<Ziltoid> hey dermathil
<Ziltoid> Oh dear I just turned on the stream
*Dermathil waves at Ziltoid while neckthrusting.
<SirSprinkles> I just put the flags on Cross so he'll auto hop when he joins the channel.
<Ziltoid> wut neckthrusting?
<Dermathil> eeeyup
<Barry1> Hi Ziltoid
<RobotPinkie> Okay so who here ISN'T bobbing their head?
<Dermathil> aka what Jim Carrey in the middle does
<Ziltoid> oh right
<Darf14> cant...stop..bobbing....head
<AllisZero> Back, gentlecoats.
<GGgala> oh, the forward-headbob
<SirSprinkles> 6Jim Carrey = best neckthruster ever
<Dermathil> Headbob includs the lowering of the forehead in a circular fashion. Neckthrusts are then it is done in a line.
<RobotPinkie> welcome back, AllisZero
<Dermathil> EEYUP you got THAT right SirSprinkles
<Espeon> 06there's this white cat around here that has it and it looks
<Dermathil> Oh, and thanks for the blast off kick yesterday Ghosties.
<RobotPinkie> lol oh okay, Dermathil
<Espeon> 06rather neat to say the least, but odd too
<Espeon> 06xD
<RobotPinkie> I guess I'm neckthrusting, then
<Angel_Espeon> 13Take a photo of it :P
<GGgala> i didn't think there was an alternative to the neckthrust. i just called it a headbob
<Ghosties> 4Not a problem Dermathil
*Ziltoid commences neckthrusting
<Sathi> Ghosties be sure to PM Ziltoid today
<RobotPinkie> >music ends right then
<Dermathil> The classical headbob is when you bob your head hard like at a rock/metal show
<Ghosties> Oh Sprinkles, a regular user came in to the mod room yesterday
<Ziltoid> awwww
<SirSprinkles> 6It's honestly been a while since we've listened to this one...
<RobotPinkie> Isn't that headbanging
<Ghosties> I thought Hipster wanted to emphasize that I not tell him he isn't hired
<Ziltoid> your talking about headbanging
<Ghosties> Oh well, whatever
<Ziltoid> dermathil
<Dermathil> headbanging and headbob are seen as the same
<Ziltoid> NOPE
<Espeon> 06I will try next time I see it
<Darf14> Its only head banging if you include the spider-man hand
<Chimera> 05indeed
*GeminiSparkle comes back. Sees what we're watching. lol
<SirSprinkles> Yeah, we don't tell them they're not hired.
<SirSprinkles> ...and wtf?
<Espeon> 06it's always creeping, but when you spot it it's gone within seconds lol
<Sathi> we don't ?
<SirSprinkles> We don't.
<Ghosties> nah, we typically don't
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ninja kitty :3
<herospirit> This song is hilarious. I've never heard it before, what's it called?
<SirSprinkles> In case we decide to bring them back for another interview in the future to see if they've improved.
<Ghosties> And I dunno how he got in, but he did
<Ziltoid> This gif goes with everything
<Sathi> channel is unprotected
<Sathi> that's how
<SirSprinkles> Channel might have dropped the all-ban again...
<Ghosties> I guess dari didn't work his code on the mod room
<GeminiSparkle> WTF Collective
<Ghosties> Unless Sprinkles wants to do it *pokes*
<SirSprinkles> It does it randomly.
<SirSprinkles> I can't.
<RobotPinkie> Ponies + anything is awesome
<Ghosties> : (
<SirSprinkles> None of us have mod here.
<herospirit> Thank you, GeminiSparkle
<Ghosties> Can't dari do it then? He has that house thing next to his name
<prince-dari> I'll check if I can set us persistant bans.
<AllisZero> I just asked my mom I'm decorating a cake for my birthday next week.
<SirSprinkles> He can.
<GeminiSparkle> Ziltoid: So if we put this to GUile's theme, would the world blow up from the sheer epicness?
<AllisZero> Err, next month
<SirSprinkles> And dari, you should give us all mod here, just in case somepony breaks in again.
<AllisZero> Fluttershy cake inc
<GeminiSparkle> You're welcome, herospirit
<prince-dari> Well I did at one point.
<prince-dari> Dunno what happened to it.
<SirSprinkles> Is this channel registered?
<Ziltoid> It would form a "this goes with everything" black hole
<herospirit> We must make this happen Ziltoid
<SirSprinkles> 6No, Ziltoid. Gummy goes with everything.
<Dermathil> >mfw my birthday is on a saturday.
<prince-dari> Eeyup
<Nittany_Tiger> Black holes: kings of the universe.
<prince-dari> >ChanServ
<Ziltoid> DO IT COLT
<SirSprinkles> Doesn't mean it's registered
<SirSprinkles> ChanServ will appear in any new channel
<Darf14> I only came here to say hi, I got thing's to do so bye :P
<Ziltoid> gummy should be in this gif
<SirSprinkles> ...or not.
<SirSprinkles> Huh.

<ValtheJean> howdy Dermathil, Ziltoid
*FreezeFrame certainly has the singing voice to do so.
*Dermathil has a new headset
<prince-dari> Is CrossBreeze's name on IRC just CrossBreeze?

<SirSprinkles> 6You did say when your b-day was, but you didn't say when you wanted the message.
<SirSprinkles> 6=P
<herospirit> amazing, Ziltoid.
<Ghosties> Alright
<prince-dari> I'll give you all access then set the channel to restricted - that shouldn't unset.
<herospirit> just amazing.
<Sathi> what if we rename ourselves?
<Ghosties> And you put the blanket ban on everyone else?
<Ziltoid> Im sorry
<prince-dari> Eeyup
<prince-dari> Sathi, then I'll have to change stuff.
<prince-dari> :P
<Ziltoid> I am abut a dirty boy
<herospirit> *flutterstare*
<SirSprinkles> ...it's because yoou're using channel modes instead of flags for it.
<SirSprinkles> The channel modes disappear after a while.
<FreezeFrame> I need to figure out how to assign specific programs to specific outputs
<Dermathil> (OHOHOH)
*Ziltoid explodes twice
<Ghosties> I mean, I do enjoy changing my nick ever now and then
<Dermathil> you got me there SirSprinkles
<Ghosties> It would suck if I couldn't get into the mod room because of that >.>
<herospirit> Can you do that? Can you explode twice?
<Ziltoid> BAWS
<FreezeFrame> Mostly so I can keep iTunes playing on my laptop while I have my HDMI hooked up.
<Dermathil> eeeeeyup
<GeminiSparkle> LIKE A BAWS
<prince-dari> Well you can join then change your nick.
<prince-dari> :P
<herospirit> EAT A BAGEL.
<prince-dari> Or I can just put restricted on and add all the mods to the access list.
<Ziltoid> OH?
<Nick> hi lunies, lightumbreon
<SirSprinkles> Did you set +B *!*@* flag and +E flag on all of us, dari?
<SirSprinkles> That should stay permanent?
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Ghosties> Whatever makes it the simplest for mods
<Lunies> Heya Nick

<ValtheJean> howdy Crossbreeze

<Dermathil> (suddenly ninja'd by sprinkles)
<SirSprinkles> 6That's Peanuts.
<CrossBreeze> 12Meh, just trying to make it tolerable to read.
<Dermathil> ^^
<FreezeFrame> ah, right
<Ziltoid> pink is the only solution
<FreezeFrame> Wait, light pink or dark pink?
<SirSprinkles> 6Blue is good and readable. =D
<Dermathil> <== has color idea.......
<FreezeFrame> no, the dark one is you
<SirSprinkles> 6Light pink is Peanut.
<Dermathil> (not sayin though)
<SirSprinkles> 6There is no dark pink mod.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm purple.
<herospirit> Man my headphones are shet. The wire casing came off, and about half the actual wires are broken. My headphones only work on one side. :0

<FreezeFrame> herospirit: I'll give you an mp3 player with a short in the headphone jack to go with them!
<Ghosties> 4Hello
<GeminiSparkle> YES!
<SirSprinkles> 6Cross, mod chat.
<herospirit> No thanks, FreezeFrame. :0
<Dermathil> don't worry herospirit. After videogames, broken headsets are probably my largest purchases in a year.
<Nittany_Tiger> You should play Bohemian Ragefaces.
<Dermathil> Bohemian Rhapsody
<SirSprinkles> 6I should play Goonies after this.
<Skylands> 10Good
<SirSprinkles> 6That sounds like the plan to me.
<CrossBreeze> Hello
<SirSprinkles> 6=D
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Nittany_Tiger> Do it the ragefaces.
<Sathi> 7heya
<Dermathil> sounds like it Sprinkles

<RobotPinkie> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<prince-dari> Ok.
*Insane_Lugia loanly plays with a top *spins it*
<Dermathil> Steven_Magnet ain't there, is he?
<Dermathil> Nope he ain't
<SirSprinkles> 6It banned your IP, dari.
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<prince-dari> Doesn't matter, exception's still set.
<prince-dari> :P
<SirSprinkles> 6I know.
<CrossBreeze> Alright, is it on the forums?
<herospirit> Can we post pictures in chat?
<SirSprinkles> 6If they're relevant.
<CrossBreeze> Nvm, *facehoof*
<herospirit> WHAT WAS THAT.
<prince-dari> Also, my hostname is obfuscated by mibbit.
<Skylands> 10Hey Espy
<SirSprinkles> 6Are you on the forums yet?
<Shad> 13pinkie pie broke my table
<herospirit> *crash*
<Shad> 13D:

<RandomExtra> ...
*Insane_Lugia lurks

<prince-dari> Nevermind.
<SirSprinkles> 6And then Shad got yelled at by the color script.
<prince-dari> I'm not using mibbit.
<prince-dari> O_o
<Dermathil> ^^
<Ziltoid> 0lawl
<SirSprinkles> 6Or if not, no colors, Shad.
<Shad> 0D:
<Nittany_Tiger> And then he was banned.
*prince-dari falls on his face
<Ziltoid> 0FOREVER
<RobotPinkie> lolno
<SirSprinkles> 6>still time for one more song
<manazuper> best movie ever
*Dermathil resists the temptation of going emo on lack of message about modship application.
<CrossBreeze> I am on the forums, made a few posts.
<herospirit> Someone on the homestuck forums noticed this in a Hub commercial or something. http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a257/GreenGuy1990/131385765929.jpg
<FreezeFrame> How about What is Love?
<AllisZero> Louderrrrrr
<Dermathil> yeah herospirit
<Dermathil> The video's been posted on EqD
<Dermathil> Seen the video
<SirSprinkles> 6SPCA ROLLED
<RobotPinkie> Evil Celestia is evil
<Dermathil> and the lack of Rainbowdash and Twilight in the picture actually worries me
<herospirit> How did I miss it? I was just thar. D:
<Dermathil> they may be in trouble in that episode
<Frubban> <- lol
<Ziltoid> 0INB4 Trollestia is canon
<FreezeFrame> No. I can't listen to this song!
<Dermathil> also, I dunno why but it feels like that may be a scene from the Luna episode.
*RobotPinkie strangles a puppy in front of SirSprinkles
*Sathi 7runs out once more
<Espeon> 06:3
<SirSprinkles> 6Cool story.
<ValtheJean> every time I hear this song, I think of that god damn animal pound commercial
<Ziltoid> 0The first episode of season has to be a luna episode
<Dermathil> Especially how Celestia seems to be prominently present in the scene in a SERIOUS pose, contrarily to her other appearances.
<SirSprinkles> 6Are you gonna stick with that blue?
<Kyu> 07then suddenly
<GeminiSparkle> THis song makes me a sad pony. :(
<Kyu> 07!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Kyu for 19 minutes
<Ziltoid> 0Just has to be
<prince-dari> What the fuck is this shit?
<ValtheJean> drives me so crazy, they're so willing to play on your god damn emotions for their own needs
<Dermathil> Ziltoid
<Kyu> 07|3c
<CrossBreeze> 12I imagine this blue will be my color from here on out.
<Sathi> 7the horror the horror
<Dermathil> S2ep7 is Luna episode
<SirSprinkles> 6Cool.
<Ziltoid> 0Lol prince-dari
<SirSprinkles> 6*will change your name color on the forums*
<Dermathil> you missed it Dari?
<Ziltoid> 0how do you know that dermathil?
<prince-dari> Missed what? :P
<CrossBreeze> 12Alright, cool.
<Angel_Espeon> 13!kyu
*Kyu 7does a barrel roll! ._.      |:      .-.      :|      ._.
<Sathi> 7we gonna need more chat colours soon!
<typjk> no, it was updated
<Angel_Espeon> 13:D
<Kyu> 07@.@
<Dermathil> Ziltoid: look at the Celestia image from the tidbit
<Dermathil> She's looking serious and not like in other appearances. Also, lack of Twilight and RD when the 4 others are with Celly means trouble for me
<SirSprinkles> 6We still have like, four.
<herospirit> My sound's off for the stream. No song for me. SO HA. *listens to Pony Swag*
<SirSprinkles> 6Grey, ugly dark pink, dark green, and dark blue
<Ghosties> 4I WANT COLORS TOO
<Sathi> 5bla
<Sathi> 14bla
<prince-dari> Seriously, why are we playing this?
<Ghosties> 4But maybe we can add more into our own domain, like a palette wheel of sorts

<CrossBreeze> 12I noticed part of Sathi's duties include being female
<Ziltoid> 0I dont see it dermathil
<SirSprinkles> 6Actually, 5, dark grey
<Bjornfot> What's up Zebras!
<RobotPinkie> Same here, muted it
<herospirit> Oh gog Pony Swag fits this gif really well.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, Cross.

<Ghosties> 4I did
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Ziltoid> 0always be trolling
*Bjornfot puts on his viking-rapeface
<Dermathil> you don't see the picture with Celestia and Rarity, AJ, Pinkie and Fluttershy behind her?
<Ghosties> 4Not at you being female, but at the being one of your "duties"
<SirSprinkles> 6I did it for the enjoyment I anticipated after permorming said activity
<Dermathil> http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a257/GreenGuy1990/131385765929.jpg
<herospirit> The head bobbing is like, exactly in beat with Pony Swag. EXACTLY.
<Dermathil> Is this working?
<Ziltoid> 0I must have missed it
<Ghosties> 4I also enjoyed it, Sprinkles
<Dermathil> I'm speaking of this image
*Sathi 7should have more duties added
<Rezo> The four ponies seem to be very happy, though, so I doubt they're visiting twilight in her dungeon
<SirSprinkles> 6SPCA headbob. =D
<Ziltoid> 0oh yeah I see it
<ValtheJean> oh oh oh, Dari, RBD said horrible things about the 10th doctor, you should totally enact mod vengeance against him the next time he's online <.< >.>
<Nittany_Tiger> I am a tiger, not a zebra.
<Sathi> 7Sathi is allrounder
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, so, I can't find Dystopia by Chaotrope on YouTube and it's pissing me off
<Dermathil> I thought they were coughing
<RobotPinkie> You're right, Pony Swag goes really well with this.
<PeanutButterWolf> The 4 mane ponies look happy behind that serious Celestia
<L[a]korv> !minnet
<herospirit> See man.
<prince-dari> ValtheJean: I banned RainBro so many times it isn't fun any more.
<Minnet> You already own me, silly.
<SirSprinkles> 6>implying I'm not going to update all the duties when I add Cross in.

<RobotPinkie> Turning on sound again, then
*Kyu slaps Nick with a halibut
<Ghosties> 4Nope, they haven't been updated
<herospirit> GOONIES.
<Ignaesia> 2 seconds of season 2 animation gets shown, fandom explodes
<Ghosties> 4Hold on, Dari
<prince-dari> Well I couldn't do that yesterday.
<Ghosties> 4I'll send it through skype
<Sathi> 7we need a special theme for LotR weekend
<prince-dari> Left the information to edit the site though.

<SirSprinkles> 6...sounds good, if they get worked out properly.
<sotha> ohai.
<Ghosties> 4I loved the idea
<Ghosties> 4I think we should do it
<SirSprinkles> 6Before we get started, guy, just one quick thing.
<SirSprinkles> 6We've updated our rules, (though not in the actual Rules link on the site).
<SirSprinkles> 6The new rules are here: http://i55.tinypic.com/294kyzo.gif
<CrossBreeze> 12Sounds like a good idea to me.
<SirSprinkles> 6Please take a moment to look over them when you can.
<Ghosties> 4THE CHAMP IS HERE! /JohnCena
<Sathi> 7wait... who?
<sotha> I'm sad the homepage hasn't been updated with today's movie listings yet.
<GeminiSparkle> who?
<Ghosties> 4Nobody
<Ghosties> 4Just nobody
<Ghosties> 4Some guy
<prince-dari> MFW .gif
<prince-dari> Wut.
<Ghosties> 4I'm sure FreezeFrame knows who he is
<sotha> Some guy like Severus Mortego Orchevald IV?
<RobotPinkie> I know who it is.
<FreezeFrame> Ah, yes, Appledough
<sotha> Wait what is airing right now?
<Ziltoid> 0Great
<Ghosties> 4HAHA :D
<FreezeFrame> Goonies, sotha
<Sathi> 7Goonies
<sotha> ooooooooooh
<Bjornfot> SHMUCK
<Ghosties> 4BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR APPLEDOUGH!!!!
<Ziltoid> 0LAWL
<FreezeFrame> Now I have a mental image of Big Mac as John Cena
<FreezeFrame> He's even the right color (for now)
<Ignaesia> man I forgot how awesome this movie was
<RobotPinkie> No, seriously, no.
<Ghosties> 4That's great
<Frubban> Oh, it's started.
<Sathi> 7any idea's for a theme next week?
<Ghosties> 4Of course, Cena wouldn't sell though
<Ignaesia> stream keeps skipping for me
<Ghosties> 4Except merch
<Ghosties> 4theme?
<RobotPinkie> Guns do that in real life.
<Ziltoid> 0This is pretty awesome
<RobotPinkie> I swear.
<Sathi> 7yes, LotR weekend
<herospirit> rules have now been read.
<sotha> IS there any way to make is so the chat box is to the right of the stream as it was in Dinkypage? For me it is below, and that is difficult.
<RobotPinkie> It IS awesome.
<Dermathil> you can, Sotah
<Ziltoid> 0>victory pyramid
<Dermathil> Sotha
<prince-dari> The rules are updated on the site page now.
<Ghosties> 4sotha: CTRL zoom out
<herospirit> try zooming out a bit Sotha
<Dermathil> I am watching it sideways right now
<SirSprinkles> 6I was going to ask somebody to make a banner for the site... just don't know who's good with photoshop...
<FreezeFrame> sotha: make your window bigger.
<Dermathil> (or is your screen not widescreen?)
<Ghosties> 4Err, ctrl mousewheel down
<Bjornfot>  ▲
<Bjornfot> ▲ ▲
<Ghosties> 4Bjornfot
<Dermathil> fail, Bjornfot
<DAS> HAY U GUYz
<Ghosties> 4Don't spam
<Bjornfot> :c
<herospirit> Bjornfot can not triforce.
<RobotPinkie> I wish this page looked like the dinkypage one...
<prince-dari> What a pony LOTR banner?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<sotha> not wide screen. The window is already full.
<Ziltoid> 0wut
<Dermathil> DATA
<Bjornfot> what, is TWO LINES counted as spam?
<prince-dari> Hmm
<Ghosties> 4Huh, maybe Silver
<Dermathil> YAY
<sotha> Ugh. You're right. I had to zoom out. Now everything is just tiny
<prince-dari> Could edit the bridlemaids ad vectors.
<Ghosties> 4HEY THAR MR. JONES
<SirSprinkles> 6That would require Silver to be... online.
<Bjornfot> I was just trying to do a victory pyramid... :c
<Ziltoid> 0AH SHIT
<prince-dari> To make them look like a fellowship. :P
<Dermathil> CHUNK
<Ghosties> 4I just know how you like to spam forces
<Dermathil> chunk is comic relief
*Umbreon rawrs at Kyu
<Sage> wow, I don't think I've ever seen this unedited
<Kyu> 07.-.
*Kyu sits all over Umbreon
<Ghosties> 4YOU HAVE MY SWORD /obligatory
<CrossBreeze> 12I have a pic of LOTR movie poster replaced with ponies you could mess around with.
<Dermathil> your chance to shine then Sage
<Umbreon> 12sure start being all active when i'm not here
*Umbreon eeps
<RobotPinkie> Joey Pants all up in this bitch.
<Angel_Espeon> 13!umbreon
<prince-dari> Hmm, that sounds good.
<Ghosties> 4If you send it in skype, I'll take a look at it
*Umbreon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 17 minutes
<Insane_Lugia> what is it with people climb on top of people and sitting on people?
<Ghosties> 4I have absolutely no experience with photoshopping, but it might be good as is
<SirSprinkles> 6Bjorn, starting the triforcing will only result in others doing it. The "Don't spam" was a preliminary attempt to prevent spam before it started.
<PeanutButterWolf> a wet sandy beach race... seems wise.
<Umbreon> 12it's just too insane for you
<Bjornfot> o
<Kyu> 07fuzzy stuff is comfortable
<Insane_Lugia> >.<
<Kyu> 07or whatever
<RobotPinkie> and then, Samwise Gamgee.

<SirSprinkles> 6But I'll use that for the Home page.
<Sathi> 7:P
<Ignaesia> keeps stoping for brief seconds
<Yappy> 1-2 second pause every minute. Ish.
<Ziltoid> 0Stream works fin for me
<Ghosties> 4That's awesome
<RobotPinkie> Stream's fine here, for now

<RobotPinkie> Favorite piece for all the gals.
<Dermathil> btw guys, did you know that the pony detroit is now called Detrot?
<sotha> Such window fail. When I'm zoomed out to see both the stream and the chat simultaneously, I can't access the buttons on the bar below the stream, so I have to zoom back in again to pause or change volume, etc.
*Sathi 7likes it
<RobotPinkie> Yes. It is.
<Dermathil> OH YES, THIS SCENE.
<Nick> hmm I'm liking how this new pic is coming along
<Kyu> 07.-.

<SirSprinkles> 6When should we do PotC?
<Purple`Prose> Hi Everypony

<Ghosties> 4Just like that?

*Umbreon chews Nick's pic to pieces

<prince-dari> L.O.

<Frubban> Eeyup.
<GGgala> Ignaesia: it so is
<SirSprinkles> 6We said we'd end up doing that, and likely Harry Potter, once the Harry Potter movies are all available... but that'll be a really long thing... and I'm not sure about it.
<Shad> 0so how much longer are they going to be....touching the statue
<RobotPinkie> trolololo

<CrossBreeze> 12Harry Potter has eight films. Are you sure? That's an awfully long time.
<Sathi> 7and fifth in the making
<AllisZero> That prick looks like my brother
<Kyu> 07whazzat

<SirSprinkles> 6Again, not sure about it.
<Umbreon> 12i dunno
<Umbreon> 12i wish he'd tell me
<Umbreon> 12XD
<SirSprinkles> 6A fifth in the making?
<Nittany_Tiger> I actually have that book that guy's mom is holding in her hand.
<SirSprinkles> 6What is this blasphemy?

<Frubban> Not suspicuous at all.
<Umbreon> 12then get on steam
<CrossBreeze> 12I doubt they'll stop until Depp stops coming back
<SirSprinkles> 6Again, just a rough thought.
<Kyu> 07I am
<Sathi> 7exactly
<SirSprinkles> 6We never decided when to do it.
<Kyu> 07.-.
<Umbreon> 12then add me
*Nick is working on it digitally
<Nick> faileon
<Ghosties> 4Maybe next summer
<AllisZero> Kids in the 80s were weird
<Ghosties> 4Which seems more appropriate

<Kyu> 07so I can't friend people
<SirSprinkles> 6HP would probably be good for summer, seeing as it's so long.
<Frubban> People in the 80s were weird.
<Kyu> 07just the other way
<Kyu> 07o3o
<Ghosties> 4It seems like PotC emphasizes summer fun though
<Shad> 0and their moms enjoyed statues with tiny genitals
<Kyu> 07so you add kyufox
<Shad> 0._.
<SirSprinkles> 6We could make a week out of it...
<Kyu> 07XP
<Umbreon> 12then let me add you
<Frubban> You got it.
<RobotPinkie> The 80s were weird.
<Ghosties> 4Why not both then
<Ghosties> 4Do both in the summer
<Ziltoid> 0dat history book
<SirSprinkles> 6Or reverse the two... PotC for summer, and HP for the week long spring break.

<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, not working.
<Ignaesia> hehe yeah :D
<Ghosties> 4Alright, edited the Steam announcement to say the pony eps will be after the movies

*RobotPinkie brohoofs FreezeFrame

<SirSprinkles> 6Oo
<prince-dari> I suppose it could mean username too.
<PeanutButterWolf> so... gunshots
<SirSprinkles> 6OH.
<Frubban> It sounded like the gunshots you hear in movies. :|'
<SirSprinkles> 6It's with 0's, not O's.
<[ger]Brony1> Spoiler: The kid's skeletons will be found in 1996
<prince-dari> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I thought you were saying with O's not 0's.
<Shad> He dropped his pot....they were talking about drug dealing
<SirSprinkles> 6>>;
<PeanutButterWolf> and not like the gunshots you hear in bambi
<SirSprinkles> 6I was wondering why you typed out the 0's in the first place.
<Sathi> 7:D
<prince-dari> Password had to include numbers.
<prince-dari> :P
<PeanutButterWolf> or the gunshots you hear in MLP:FIM. Real gunshots
<prince-dari> And no one wanted to suggest one (Sathi did actually, but I'd already changed it by then)
<[ger]Brony1> Mmmmm, an icemachine rusting for the last twenty years. Let's see, if there is something to eat in it.
<Frubban> All the gunshots in FiM are real gunshots.
<RobotPinkie> Bambi's mother was asking to get shot.
<Frubban> Every single one.
<Frubban> Agreed.
<SirSprinkles> 6TF is RD?
<[ger]Brony1> Suddenly: Delicatessen
<Ziltoid> Italien?
<prince-dari> Probably stuff for my hidden thing on the home page.

<Ziltoid> Dman
<prince-dari> The fuck?
<Ziltoid> Dman*
<Ziltoid> Dman*
<Ziltoid> FUCK
<PeanutButterWolf> Antipasta
<herospirit> FiM is just so violent with all it's gunshots.
<[ger]Brony1> And a glass of cianti
<Dermathil> Dman's not there Ziltoid.
<prince-dari> Oh yeah.
<Ghosties> 4And FTP mode and all that jazz?
<prince-dari> I made that page, but decided to do it a different way.
<Ziltoid> Damn*
<prince-dari> It's not actually necessary now.
<Ziltoid> there I did it
<RobotPinkie> lololol
*Shad claps
<SirSprinkles> 6Was it like, script or something? Oo
<Frubban> lol
<RobotPinkie> Epic spelling correction
<Ziltoid> inb4 rum
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, I'm going to make a History page for the list of movies we've shown.
<ValtheJean> Dman is now officially Damn
<Sage> lol "bullet holes the size of matza balls"
<[ger]Brony1> It's wet, ain't it?
<prince-dari> It was for the end of my puzzle
<ValtheJean> and we shall address him as such from now and forever
<prince-dari> You had to type the konami code on the home page of our site.
<Frubban> Mantza holes.
*Insane_Lugia Pulls Umbreon's tail and runs off
<Frubban> Matza*
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<SirSprinkles> 6I thought so.
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<Ziltoid> I love bears
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll actually use it for scripts, so we can keep the script for the countdown clock on the site.
<Ziltoid> and siging
<Ghosties> 4I have no idea what is going on right now :S
<RobotPinkie> >he can feel one eyed willie down there
<SirSprinkles> 6Instead of importing it from elsewhere...
<Shad> he's a bear...
<AllisZero> Why am I so interested in this old-ass movie from the 80s which I've seen about a dozen times in the bast when I didn't have stupid cable
<prince-dari> I think I'll make a countdown timer that we don't have to update ever week.
<AllisZero> I think it's because my brony friends are here.
<prince-dari> Because that's just annoying.
<prince-dari> :P
<[ger]Brony1> Dat mutant
<PeanutButterWolf> cocks harder than my mama's cannolis
<Shad> I've never seen it
<SirSprinkles> 6It takes me two seconds to do.
<Frubban> Probably
*Shad feels uncool
<lightumbreon> 06get that tail thief!
<PeanutButterWolf> Tiramisu
<prince-dari> Meh, sometimes you can't access the page.
<AllisZero> past*
<SirSprinkles> 6And I prefer it this way for when we do special events.
<prince-dari> You're not always at your computer.
<Ziltoid> ive never seen it either
<lightumbreon> 06you can kill Umbreon, or shave him, even make period jokes about him
<prince-dari> Also, it'd take 2 seconds to add in a new date to countdown the way I'd do it.
<Frubban> Me neither
<lightumbreon> 06but stealing his tail is too much!
<prince-dari> XML driven flash.
<Umbreon> 12period jokes?
*lightumbreon gets out a BFG9000
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll have wifi at my house soon.
<Angel_Espeon> 13o-o
<[ger]Brony1> Hay, Mork
<Sathi> 7neither do I ghosties

*lightumbreon fires LAZORS at Insane_Lugia

<Umbreon> 12i understand what you are getting at
<prince-dari> What?
<Umbreon> 12i just fail to see how umbreon can be mixed with it
<SirSprinkles> 6Would that allow for it to show the "Show Time!" message?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<prince-dari> It'd allow for anything you want it to do.
<prince-dari> :P

<Insane_Lugia> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Insane_Lugia, you are a 7Tynamo.

<AllisZero> Cartman's mom isn't hot
<GGgala> poor, predictable chunk
<Insane_Lugia> guess u dont get a list of attacks
<Quanyails> 7Twilly is 10 views away from her kiriban.
<SirSprinkles> 6Could you by chance make a decent chat client, just so that we can have more colors to choose from?
<Insane_Lugia> k cya ima go back to lurking
<SirSprinkles> 6And a server... we really need our own server...
<AllisZero> It jumped out of the bushes
<prince-dari> A server I've got set up.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm tired of dealing with tech issues.
<prince-dari> I've said that a couple of times.
<prince-dari> But I'm not sure if my internet can handle 300 people.
<SirSprinkles> 6Cool, we'll switch when we go to our new domain then?
<SirSprinkles> 6Ah.
<Shad> I wonder why it was hiding in the bushes
<prince-dari> Which is why I suggested something else.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, that's a problem...
<AllisZero> It just wanted to be pet by Fluttershy
<prince-dari> As in all the mods runs a server each for the duration of the BMN stream at least.
<prince-dari> The ones not streaming anyway.
<GGgala> ah yes, the elusive fish-rake.
<Ziltoid> animals just want love
<SirSprinkles> 6That would require us all to have the ability to run a server.
<GGgala> >cockblocked
<AllisZero> That chick has the best hair
<Shad> now is not the time for that activity
<FiveYearOldDamos> http://awesome-base.deviantart.com/art/Pokemon-Funny-213746192
<prince-dari> Nah, I can set everything up for you guys.
<prince-dari> I said before.
<prince-dari> You'd just need to run the program.
<GGgala> her lesbian friend sure is jealous
<SirSprinkles> 6But I would like a better built in chat client. Not much better, but with at least better color selection.
<Sage> nor the place for it
<ctr> read that as furry
<prince-dari> I do have a client partially made.
<prince-dari> But.
<prince-dari> Meh.
<SirSprinkles> 6i.e. type in hex, get color.
<Ziltoid> NOPE
<SirSprinkles> 6It doesn't need to be soon, just, at some point.
<[ger]Brony1> Fuck you, guys, i am going home!
<prince-dari> The problem with that Sprinkles is, it would only work with other people using my client.
<PeanutButterWolf> YOU SLUT
<AllisZero> Shut up lesbo
<Lakorv> Chrome can go die in a fire
<SirSprinkles> 6>built in client
<PeanutButterWolf> *klutz*
<prince-dari> To people on mIRC and any other client it wouldn't show lal the different colours.
<Lakorv> it's never stable anyway.
<Ziltoid> Lolumad lady?
<prince-dari> all*
<AllisZero> U mad
<AllisZero> She mad
<prince-dari> I also had the idea of adding the ability to play games with people using the same client.
<SirSprinkles> 6Then they should be using the client that's built in to the stream page, which would be that client.
<SirSprinkles> 6That would be cool.
<prince-dari> So you could play noughts and crosses, 4 in a row, etc.
<prince-dari> I haven't really seen that on IRC before.
<SirSprinkles> 6Give them something to do when the stream isn't on.
<ctr> it's more stable than FIREFOX
<Ziltoid> Fifty dalla bill
<Lakorv> ...no
<[ger]Brony1> Crazy teenage Eddie Lizzard.
<Shad> HOLY CHRIST 50 DOLLARS
<Lakorv> Chromium takes half a year to load a single link at times
<RobotPinkie> FIFTY DORRAH OH GOD
<prince-dari> Problem is last time I worked on my client was a while ago.
<Lakorv> and when at first it gets slow, it stays slow.

<prince-dari> Not sure where I got to with it.
<[ger]Brony1> Doktah Jones, Doktah Jones.
<prince-dari> Or if I remember how it works.
<SirSprinkles> 6Again, not something that needs immediately done.
<GGgala> 50 bucks?! we can buy back the house with that kinda money!
<prince-dari> My coding is usually pretty hard to understand. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Just, whenever you feel like it.
<Shad> I can't buy a new video game for that kind of money
<prince-dari> I suppose I could release a provisional version.
<Ziltoid> Chocalate eruption?
<AllisZero> Icecream has a smell?
<Sage> he smells ice cream through 3 inches of metal
<prince-dari> Because the hard part is making it multiserver/multichannel capable.
<[ger]Brony1> Aaaaaaaand?
<herospirit> Chunk is the man
<AllisZero> HAhahahah
<prince-dari> Which was what I was working on when I last tested it.
<PeanutButterWolf> They have Grape... and Grape
<sotha> I can buy a third of Skyrim collectors edition with that money.
<sotha> c:
<Ziltoid> Chunk has superpoers
<lightumbreon> 06that be your internet connection lakrov
<lightumbreon> 06a browser doesn't have ANYTHING to do with loading speeds
<prince-dari> I could release a quick version which only lets users join one channel or something.

<SirSprinkles> 6>doesn't smell dead guy
<SirSprinkles> 6...wat
<ctr> lightumbreon, rendering speeds :p
<AllisZero> People in the 80s were as dense as the shitty Duke Nukem Forever AI
<herospirit> he could smell icecream through the fourth wall. GODDAMMIT CHUNK GIVE ME MY ICECREAM BACK.
<Ignaesia> its because hes fat get it? lolololol
<HyperMetalLugia> Chrome is way better than Firefox lol :p
<sotha> Selective attention
<Espeon|Away> opinions tiem
<HyperMetalLugia> IE9/10 is still the best
*HyperMetalLugia flees
<[ger]Brony1> He touched the pepparoni. Ice him!
<ctr> Internet explorer can't even draw pages properly
<Espeon|Away> anyway, I'll be back eventually
<ctr> and it doesn't follow standards either
<HyperMetalLugia> It will :p
<SirSprinkles> 6Which is all we'd need initially.
<prince-dari> Some of our current users use mibbit to join their own channels though.
<Lakorv> lightumbreon: my internet connection does not occupy 56% of my cpu and crash all my tabs randomly..
<PeanutButterWolf> because frozen food tends to have a strong smell
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah...
<prince-dari> Not sure if everyone would be happy only being able to join one.
<Lakorv> I know very well what is my connection and what is not.
<Ziltoid> Pedo corpse
<AllisZero> Kids screaming and yelling under 2 inches of badly placed wooden floors
<AllisZero> And nobody notices
<Sage> giving the term "stiff" a new name...
<ctr> if a BROWSER takes that much CPU then it's your cpu that's crap
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, be better off if you got it all done and released it.
<[ger]Brony1> Gimme sugar, chump
<Sage> or, meaning
<ctr> a Browser isn't CPU intensive at all
<SirSprinkles> 6We can deal with mibbit until then.
<lightumbreon> 06i only use 2 if 8 CPU's, and my connection is stable enough for 20MB/S internet
<AllisZero> I'm sure that if Youtube were around back then
<Lakorv> ctr: yeah, sure my Intel dualcore at 1.87 GHz per core is crap..
<HyperMetalLugia> Never seemed to have that problem with any of my browsers before :P
<AllisZero> We'd have a ton of videos calling that corpse a pedo
<HyperMetalLugia> 1.87ghz dual core
<AllisZero> And suing the producers
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah, crap for this time :P
<Ziltoid> Thank go we have that now
<HyperMetalLugia> This is 2011, not 2005 xD
<Lakorv> HyperMetalLugia: laptop, silly.
<HyperMetalLugia> And? :P
<[ger]Brony1> Gesundheit!
<ctr> Chrome doesn't even eat 10% of my 2.0 GHz single core Pentium 4 on my 7 year old PC XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Most laptops are quad/duo at 2+ ghz
<SilverSonic> LU, Im going live shortly :p
<Lakorv> this dualcore at 1.87 outperforms old dualcores at 2.5
<AllisZero> worst possible rescuer
<HyperMetalLugia> And whee, brb
<Lakorv> ctr: how many tabs and how long's it been running? :P
<[ger]Brony1> Spoiler: Fat guy doesn't fit window
<AllisZero> >walking forever
<ctr> 15 tabs and many hours
<AllisZero> >3 minutes
<[ger]Brony1> Shut up, Eddie Lizzard!
<HyperMetalLugia> I can usually run Chrome with 25+ tabs fine for a hour or two
<HyperMetalLugia> And that's a lot of tabs
<Ziltoid> Lights.
<Lakorv> well you're lucky then.. I'm low on tabs (19) and have had this running for about 10 hours I think.
<Lakorv> getting slow now.
<Sathi> 7Stream is derping a bit here
<Shad> THE LIGHT, IT BURNNNNS
<Lakorv> I used to have way more tabs though <.<
<herospirit> You dare bring light into my lair!?

<[ger]Brony1> Spoiler: Kids with asthma sprays allways die in 80's movies.
<ctr> Firefox has been a loyal RAM eater since ages
<Ziltoid> I dont really know whats happening anymore
<Lakorv> HyperMetalLugia: 1.83 GiB and quite some extensions. Chromium.
<Pegacorn> Chunk used STALL!It's super effective!
<PeanutButterWolf> They're in a cave
<Lakorv> and no, Firefox is memory light compared to Chromium.
<PeanutButterWolf> because the plot says so
<Shad> I watch it for the plot
<RobotPinkie> Ohgreat, candles.....
<Ziltoid> >Candles
<Darken_Skye> did the kid with asthma spray die in the IT movie?
<Pegacorn> inb4 DY NO MITE
<[ger]Brony1> You sprung my trap card
<HyperMetalLugia> I have around 7 running, same amount as you
<Lakorv> you can do 20 tabs in Fx with what you need for 5-10 in Chromium.
<HyperMetalLugia> For RAM
<AllisZero> CANCLES
<GGgala> >candles
<nickstr> I have had Firefox running on machines with under 128 MB of RAM
<SirSprinkles> 6DYNOMITE! DYNOMITE!
<Lakorv> exactly.
<RobotPinkie> >it looks like a one eyed willie
<GGgala> ...don't kids watch cartoons in the eighties?
<Bjornfot> DY NO MITE IS BEST CANDLES
<Pegacorn> dat skull
<nickstr> Chrome might have choked those TO DEATH
<Nittany_Tiger> Shake that booty trap.
<[ger]Brony1> Oh hi, Murphy
<RobotPinkie> He failed at disarming the trap
<GGgala> Bugs Bunny should be all the education you need to recognize dy-no-mite
<SirSprinkles> 6FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF BOULDERDASH
<Dermathil> Rube Goldberg again
<Lakorv> Chromium is currently using ~40% of my 1.83 GiB / 2 GB RAM
<ctr> i could run chromium with 256 mb RAM + 256 MB Pagefile
<[ger]Brony1> Let's pull this
<Pegacorn> LEEEEEEEEROY
<PeanutButterWolf> Shake it. Bake it. Booby quake it. Roll it around.
<[ger]Brony1> ... not
<Lakorv> milibit?
<RobotPinkie> RUN INDY RUN!
<[ger]Brony1> Run, Shorty!
<GGgala> FREEZE! No, wait, the exact opposite of that!
<nickstr> try it on a machine with 64 MB of RAM
<AllisZero> I'm sure that would have been very effective
<Pegacorn> Short Round is best round.
<PeanutButterWolf> Merry-go-round is best Round
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm just using around 60% of my RAM with mIRC/Chrome/WLM/Powershell and a couple of folders open :p
<[ger]Brony1> Go over there, Shorty and don't touch anything - CRASH! - I didn't touch anything!
<GGgala> lesbian-nerd-girl! where's your nerd glasses?
<nickstr> Chrome
<RobotPinkie> 20 years later, he's Batman.
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, 1 GB roughly
<nickstr> THERE IS YOUR PROBLEM
<HyperMetalLugia> I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEMS
<[ger]Brony1> God did what? Crazy Eddie Lizzard
<Ziltoid> dem bat puppets
<AllisZero> The charming batman
<Lakorv> 66% of my ram (1096 MB) with Chromium, Skype, Exaile (music), and 6 terminals.
<ReticentSmolder> WAVE BEAM ACQUIRED
<Ziltoid> This pleases Italian man
<nickstr> is you disk being accessed regularly?
<ctr> Firefox with 4 tabs eats 90 MB RAM + 157 MB pagefile here XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Nope, lol
*PeanutButterWolf keeps eating anyway
<herospirit> Italian man likes this kid
<AllisZero> Chunk is a supertroll
<PeanutButterWolf> Watch out for that Batdemic!
<nickstr> I thought of giving Chrome a try
<Shad> they need to bring ozzy in there, teach those bats a lesson
<PeanutButterWolf> Shock and Terror
<nickstr> but seeing as its memory intensive I will not
<GGgala> what the hell, the bats disassembled the fireplace?
<Sage> time for a bat smoothie
<Ziltoid> omnomnomnom
<ctr> ok
<Pegacorn> Now that 47 bronies are here,i could ask if anypony knows who Jonah Hex is.Why would i ask that?Because Josh Brolin is in this movie,and he plays Jonah Hex in the Jonah Hex movie.It makes sense.
<GGgala> SUPER-BATS
<nickstr> plus you are stuck with the interface Google wants you to have
<ctr> Well
<GGgala> Pegacorn: I know the basics.
<AllisZero> Alright, gonna go work on my picture
<ctr> The interface Firefox has been adopting :P
<Pegacorn> I am epic nerd.
<RobotPinkie> I kinda want to watch Batman Begins now...
<AllisZero> So you gentlecoats have fun with the movie
<nickstr> you can't customize Chorme
<HyperMetalLugia> There are other builds of Chrome/ium and other browsers too :p
<AllisZero> I'll be back for the episode
<Ziltoid> bye alliszero
<prince-dari> nickstr: Wut
<nickstr> you can customize Firefox
<GGgala> whoa
<prince-dari> You can have themes on chrome.
<[ger]Brony1> Beautiful Waterfalll all the wayyyyyyy
<RobotPinkie> later, AllisZero
<prince-dari> I don't know what you're talking about.
<HyperMetalLugia> You can customise Chrome too?
<prince-dari> :P
<HyperMetalLugia> And LOl personas
<GGgala> Pegacorn: which one is he?
<Ziltoid> also gentlecoats
<Pegacorn> No idea.
<Darken_Skye> Jonah hex is a second string DC character right?
<[ger]Brony1> Tata
<Lakorv> I like the vimium extension for Chrom(e|ium)
<prince-dari> I should know (chrome pony theme).
<Lakorv> it makes it keyboard-usable.
<Pegacorn> Jonah Hex is a forgotten DC character,but he's totally BAWS.
<PeanutButterWolf> How DARE you say he's Kennedy!!!!!
<Nittany_Tiger> It's Charlie Sheen you moron!
<[ger]Brony1> Where's the Charlie Sheen coins?
<Ghosties> 4About to go idle. Can't have that
<Pegacorn> WINNING
<RobotPinkie> Not a physics major, that librarian chick...
<Shad> Charlie sheen coins are more than anyone could survive
<Darken_Skye> He was in the justice league animated series, thats the only reason I remember him
<GGgala> Pegacorn: Ah, it's the big brother guy.
<[ger]Brony1> Sooo many coins. Scott Pilgrim must have been here.
<Sathi> 7okay this is getting annoying
<HyperMetalLugia> Keyboard browsing seems very slow
<PeanutButterWolf> He was in Batman The Animated Series
<HyperMetalLugia> Multitasking interfaces plz
<Sathi> 7need to press refresh every 3 or 5 mins
<Pegacorn> Eeyup
<Shad> before he had throat cancer?
<Ignaesia> that lesbian chick is such a killjoy

<Lakorv> lol
<lightumbreon> 06nah, not handy hor me xD
<nickstr> nope
<Lakorv> 'many ram'
<nickstr> sticking with Firefox
<Pegacorn> Jonah Hex is so BAWS that he can be in a show that's not even his and make it so that the show's main character isn't there!
<Ghosties> 4Also, I have a question. Would it be okay to pick "Boyz in the Hood" for A movie?
<nickstr> and its Personas
<HyperMetalLugia> I removed the top of the capslock button
<nickstr> sorry
<lightumbreon> 06got a Philips225B and a HP1740, it's good
<nickstr> Chrome does not interest me at this time
<PeanutButterWolf> It's every boy's dream to make it with Andy
<[ger]Brony1> Dat coin-trick
<Sathi> 7are you gonna pick the A movie then? :P
<GGgala> wish-blocked!
<Lakorv> HyperMetalLugia: keyboard shortcuts for browsing is handy and not slow at all.. guess it's all about user preference.
<Ghosties> 4Yes :D
<Sathi> 7I wanna pick :(
<Ghosties> 4Okay T_T
<HyperMetalLugia> So what happens if a key gets stuck
<[ger]Brony1> Follow me, for i am Leeeeroy Jeeeeenkins!
<Ghosties> 4OH GOD

<Ghosties> 4Haha, no, I don't think so
<PeanutButterWolf> Dat fake stutter.
<Ziltoid> ARRRRGGG
<herospirit> Wait, couldn't they have skipped that whole part of search by just jumping down the well
<GGgala> Shad: ...which guy?
<Sathi> 7awww :(
<FreezeFrame> Goonies :D
<sonicfan315> someone forgot his meeeeeeedddddss...
<[ger]Brony1> Fun Fact: You can't slow down your fall, by slashing the sail with a knife.
<RainbowDerpin> Mythbusters
<RainbowDerpin> ftw
<sonicfan315> awesome show
<Ghosties> 4The closest we've come to decide on something like that is where each mod picks their favorite movie we've shown (or favorite A movie shown) and then we restream it
<Shad> You can prevent death by falling by using commando pro
<Dermathil> >yfw that move isn't done to slow fall but to ruin the sail so the bad guys can't escape as fast
<Pegacorn> COMAAAAAAAAAAAAAANDOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<PeanutButterWolf> She's the Gooniest of all the Goonies
<Ziltoid> I dont want to hamburgertime
<Nittany_Tiger> But you just said die.
<Shad> YAY SECOND INSPIRATIONAL SPEECH WITH DRAMATIC MUSIC
<SirSprinkles> 6DOWN HERE IT'S OUR TIME.
<Pegacorn> Hey GGgala,i invited you to join my Jonah Hex group.
<ReticentSmolder> Pegacorn is going commando
<SirSprinkles> 6IT'S OUR TIME DOWN HERE.
<Ignaesia> forget the chick shes a load anyway
<Lakorv> so what happens if your touchpad flails? It gets hard to navigate anything of course.
<Lakorv> there are weak spots to anything.
<[ger]Brony1> Goonies say 'cross the jordan', 'jump the bucket', 'pass the spoon', 'expire', ....
<herospirit> DOWN TIME IS OUR HERE.
<Pegacorn> lolwut
<PeanutButterWolf> It's your time, baby. Smoke Virgina Slims
<HyperMetalLugia> You can just add a USB mouse? xD
<SirSprinkles> 6No.
<Ziltoid> TIME OUR HERE IS DOWN
<Ghosties> 4Your time is up, my time is now! You can't see me, my time is now!
<Pegacorn> Smoking is for losers.
<RobotPinkie> HERE IS OUR DOWN TIME
<Dermathil> Dat insult
<SirSprinkles> 6We'll be doing the lottery after Fellowship of the Ring next week.
<[ger]Brony1> Crazy kid, that's not how time-zones and time-travel work.
<herospirit> OUR DOWN IS HERE TIME
<sonicfan315> ah and the realization sets in
<Lakorv> well add a usb keyboard then?
<Umbreon> 12usb port dies
<Umbreon> 12*shot*
<Shad> I get a boner every time I see his face
<HyperMetalLugia> Those are way bigger than mice :P
<Shad> especially when he says chocolate
<Pegacorn> Ghosties,you win the internet.
<Sathi> 7fair enough
<Lakorv> you're just trying to be an arse :P
<Ghosties> 4Right
<[ger]Brony1> My own sweater. Yay!
<Ziltoid> Chocolate?
<Umbreon> 12laptop explodes in a fire
<Umbreon> 12now what
<HyperMetalLugia> No, I'm just thinking of every flaw ever created :P
<Ziltoid> derp
<mib_j8ttbu> giggle at the ghosties, giggle at the ghosties !!
<Ghosties> 4I see Pegacorn is a wrestling fan as well
<nickstr> there are such things as PCMCIA USB interfaces
<GGgala> Pegacorn: group?
<prince-dari> Evil Dead 2 needs a restream sometime. XD
<Ghosties> 4Or just a John Cena fan
<Dermathil> SHHH anon
<nickstr> I had one that did USB 2.0 back in 2002
<prince-dari> Because it's so great.
<Ziltoid> ARGGGHH
<Lakorv> nickstr: not all laptops have pcmcia. :P
<nickstr> not true
<Lakorv> we could go on like this forever.
<Pegacorn> GGgala,i made a Jonah Hex group earlier today.
<Ghosties> 4...I concur
<nickstr> all the older ones have PCMCIA
<Ghosties> 4You should pick it, dari
<FreezeFrame> Dat product placement.
<Pegacorn> Ghosties,i'm a wrestling fan even though i know it's fake.
<Ghosties> 4When we do favorite movie
<nickstr> many of which have CardBus which is 32 bit PCMCIA
<PeanutButterWolf> Chunk's hungry because he's fat.
<FreezeFrame> Scripted
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, scripted
<GGgala> Pegacorn: OH i see what you mean now :D joined
<Pegacorn> Right.
<FreezeFrame> And yes, it is an important distinction.
<HyperMetalLugia> My laptop seems to have two expansion slots on the side o.o
<Nittany_Tiger> Cannibal kids!
<Ghosties> 4It really is to pro wrestling enthusiasts
<Pegacorn> Sorry about that mistake Ghosties.
<HyperMetalLugia> Also wondering why it seems to have a screw on there, hah
<Ziltoid> dat kiss
<Ghosties> 4Haha, it's no problem. I'm not gonna jump down your throat for calling it fake like a lot of other smarks will
<Pegacorn> ok
<FreezeFrame> It is an important distinction in general. Fake implies that there's no risk going on, while scripted is a much more apt description since it says "the end is determined, but the risk is huge"
<Shad> its too big
<Shad> giggity
<EdmarFecler> Greetings.
<Ghosties> 4And FreezeFrame is right
<Dermathil> RUBE GOLDBERG AGAIN
<Pegacorn> True dat FreezeFrame.But that does bring up a question to me.Why the hell did they make HBK quit?
<nickstr> PCMCIA CardBus provides very fast speeds
<EdmarFecler> that doesnt seem physically possible.
<Ghosties> 4They didn't force him to quit
<Ghosties> 4He retired
<FreezeFrame> It was the story for his retirement.
<Dermathil> it isn't, EF.
<Pegacorn> ok
<nickstr> in fact I have seen TV tuner/video capture cards and USB interfaces for it
<RobotPinkie> .....physics...
<EdmarFecler> screw them
<Dermathil> I'VE BEEN SAVED BY MY PINCHERS OF PERIL
<Ghosties> 4Unless it was indeed the angle for his retirement, but yeah, he legit wanted to retire
<EdmarFecler> mits a movie.
<EdmarFecler> its*
<[ger]Brony1> Go-Go-Gadget Arm

<EdmarFecler> oops

<Dermathil> oh oh
<RainBroDash> 10oh yeah btw, I'm at my dad's now, and there was a kids' DVD on in the car on the way from the station. I'd completely forgotten how shit kids TV shows are nowadays, since FiM...

<Pegacorn> Oh.I'll just call him Undertaker.
<Ghosties> 4THAT HARLOT

<EccoCode> Thank you NIck!
<lightumbreon> 06heya Ecco :3
<RobotPinkie> dat pun
<SirSprinkles> 6We're already going to watch 6 eps, which I'm sure we can probably PREDICT what they are, so adding special rules would be annoying.
<FiveYearOldDamos> hey eccy chan
<PeanutButterWolf> what pun?
<EccoCode> And hey LU and Damos as well, how are you all today?
<RobotPinkie> Need to refresh stream again, I think, I'm lagging behind

<PeanutButterWolf> oh *hits refresh*
<CrossBreeze> 12Oooh, predictions...

<EdmarFecler> ^ 3 ^
<Ghosties> 4On that topic of prediction, I've already got the list of fim eps up so if I get chosen, you best believe I'll pick something we've never seen in Brony State
<GGgala> ESPECIALLY pirates love water slides.
<Dermathil> ^^
<[ger]Brony1> Pirates of the Caribbean (TM) - Water slide (C)
<PeanutButterWolf> waterslide? I love missing whole scenes due to refresh

<lightumbreon> 06:3
<Ghosties> 4What I mean is that I'll pick something that hasn't been chosen yet
<PeanutButterWolf> Same a car gets in to your basement.

<[ger]Brony1> And that's how Equistria was made.

<GGgala> Dman: wait, did you mean me or Rodman?
<lightumbreon> 06just as firefox
<prince-dari> Some of the balloons at the party make up Pinkie Pie's cutie mark.
<GGgala> oh you did
<ValtheJean> ah, sorry. didn't notice that >.<
<sonicfan315> Pinkie Pie = Lauren Faust?
<[ger]Brony1> Defend her honour and let her drop to her death.

<GGgala> and Dman: no, i added the implying just cuz :p
<nickstr> it eats up your RAM like there is no tomorrow
<Lakorv> ^
<nickstr> plus the expandibility sucks
<Rezo> Fact: Rainbow Dash is flying through the Starfox 64 training parcour.
<RainbowDerpin> Filly dash = awesome dash
<ctr> When Chrome freezes, at least not every tab does :P
<SirSprinkles> 6WINNING

<klstixbro> WINNINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
<nickstr> I checked the extensions and themes
<Bjornfot> winning¨
<nickstr> NOT IMPRESSED
<ctr> Well
<FreezeFrame> Pinkie Pie is Equestria's joker, right down to unreliable narrator-ness. The reason she isn't murderously insane is that Equestria is a sugar bowl.
<Sage> huuuuge G's
<Dman> She likes winning
<[ger]Brony1> And then she lost her mane and tail
<nickstr> I am sticking with Firefox
<Ziltoid> DAT SMILE
<ctr> chrome already has firebug built in
<RobotPinkie> Legendary pony
<Dman> Bjornfot is here too? :O
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't care what browser I use, so long as it works
<sonicfan315> *lulz at Beavis and Butthoof thinking they can beat Rainbow Dash*
<GGgala> "to DEFEND FLUTTERSHY'S HONOR!" and then there was FlutterDash.
<nickstr> at least it has not given me trouble
<ctr> Adblocker is not very great but works
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just use firefox because it's what I'm used to
<Bjornfot> DAHS IS NOT LESBIAN, SHE'S BI. BI-WINNING
<CrossBreeze> 12Raibow Dash is best pony.
<Lakorv> ctr: my chromium /does/ kill every tab, strangely..
<klstixbro> retarded face is retarded
<nickstr> and I set it up so that I like it
<SilverSonic|Live> AE, Agreed
<ctr> Tweetdeck is AWESOME
<Angel_Espeon> 13why change it when this works just fine? :P
<herospirit> wait "against all odds" to defend Fluttershy's honor? What are you saying about Fluttershy?
<SirSprinkles> 6...DEMODDING TIME
<prince-dari> No, that's how you earn 6 cutie marks.
<prince-dari> AT THE SAME TIME.
<Dman> silly CrossBreeze, that's not how you spell everypony
<prince-dari> BAM!
<RainbowDerpin> @crossbreeze agreed
<Bjornfot> no Dman, it's all in your imagination
<prince-dari> Dash is just that awesome.
<Dman> BAM! there it is!
<interior_gummy> dash totally dated gilda in high flight schoo
<klstixbro> Oh here comes the explanation!
<Dman> Bjornfot D:
<ValtheJean> Prince-Dari: Nah, that's just how you Mary Sue :P
<klstixbro> The plot!
<klstixbro> the theme
<GGgala> >Crossbreeze demoted.
<PeanutButterWolf> dat halfop
<Rodman> Silly comments. Rainbow Dash isn't a Lesbian. SHE'S NOT EVEN FROM LESBIA!
<prince-dari> Got the best pony right.
<CrossBreeze> 0Cross Breeze cries quietly in civilian colors
<prince-dari> Trololo
<klstixbro> the america
<Sathi> 7waaaat
<FreezeFrame> gummy: Yeah, I can totally believe it.
<RainbowDerpin> Dash is the cause for 6 cutie marks = 20% most awesome pony

<prince-dari> Lol Sprinkles. XD
<Dman> awesome then! yay~
<interior_gummy> even though fluttershy is totally a hippie
<ctr> My opinion is that Firefox is faster than Chrome when not many tabs are open
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari and I are the only ones that can actually properly fight eachother. XD
<GGgala> Mod War: WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?!
<klstixbro> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<ctr> but Chrome wins when more tabs are open
<klstixbro> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<klstixbro> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<klstixbro> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<ValtheJean> @GGgala I'm on the side of whoever wins :P

<SirSprinkles> 6So, after Fellowship of the Ring on Friday is Fall Weather Friends and Ticket Master.
<Sathi> 7it's everyone in the channel
<HyperMetalLugia> Can we all agree that if it isn't Safari/Opera, it's a good browser?
<SirSprinkles> 6After Two Towers on Saturday is Griffon the Brush Off and Bridle Gossip.
<Ghosties> 4I would have picked Applebuck Season, or Owl's Well That Ends Well
*HyperMetalLugia hides
<prince-dari> ^ My episode choice.

<ValtheJean> welp, I've gotta go get my haircut...damnable school haircode. I'll be back later gents. Adios
<Ziltoid> lawl
<EspyLacopa> I couldn't tell where I was in that list.
<Dashite> Huh, that was still on...
<Dman> WHERE IS MY WINTER WRAP UP BEST EPISODE?
<Dman> :(
*Bjornfot wonders why there was no film lottery for next week. Did we have that yesterday? I kinda fell asleep halfway during the stream...
<Nittany_Tiger> I wanted to see Swarm of the Century myself.
<Dman> RobotPinkie, I have a request, if you don't mind.
<[ger]Brony1> No THE GREAT AND POWERFULL TRIXIE?
<PeanutButterWolf> Episode 8: Look Before You Sleep is really hard to find on Youtube
<Rodman> Awww, no Suited for Success???
<SirSprinkles> 6AND ON TO BUCKAROO BANZAI
<RobotPinkie> What, Dman?
<Dashie> 12 chances and I still didn't win.. D:
<Dermathil> Bjornfot, LOTR marathon
<prince-dari> Bjornfot: LOTR event next week
<sonicfan315> I was hoping for Pinkie Keen or Stare master
<EspyLacopa> I would have said Feeling Pinkie Keen.
<Sumica> Drat, I was just in time to be late
<Dermathil> >mfw faster than dari
<Dashite> Nittany_Tiger_ has good taste
<sonicfan315> ah well
<Dman> RobotPinkie, could you do a very special vector just for me?
<Bjornfot> is that INSTEAD of the normal show?
<Dermathil> yes
<Bjornfot> i thought it was a bonus
<prince-dari> Dermathil: Typed twice as much as you
<Dermathil> extended editions
<SirSprinkles> 6It was specified at one point during raffle, actually.
<HyperMetalLugia> Fine, Safari is the worst browser ever made then :P
<prince-dari> Lawl
<PeanutButterWolf> Look Before You Sleep is the worst episode.
<Dman> EXTENDED YEEEAAA
<interior_gummy> goddammit, best episodes have to be on the day i can't come
<RobotPinkie> What do you want me to do a vector of, Dman?
<Ghosties> 4So HAH!
<SirSprinkles> 6I used to put it in the threads "G4 Pony Episode"
<Rezo> Look before you sleep is underrated
<Dermathil> At least Zecora episode Bridle Gossip was taken.
<sonicfan315> Movie ftw
<SirSprinkles> 6But I don't bother anymore...
<Ghosties> 4But man
<Dman> http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/049/b/4/daisy_dreams_by_jacugo-d39rstw.png I'd love a vector of Daisy Dreams. If that's alright with you, RobotPinkie
<mib_2x6l4j> .... as an anon. Stupid chat client fail.
<sonicfan315> yay zecora
<Dermathil> Suddenly, SW text wall
<prince-dari> ...
<RobotPinkie> Indeed, I would've picked Look Before You Sleep
<Dman> BANZAIIII
<prince-dari> I've never seen it specified.
<Ghosties> 4YFW only one episode that you predicted to get picked got picked
<Dermathil> Dman, you read the new rules?
<Sathi> 7different intro?
<CrossBreeze> 12Back in a bit.
<Sathi> 7hahaha
<Dermathil> They'Ve been changed a 'lil bit
<Sathi> 7smart CB
<Dman> Dermathil, new ru,les finally put in place? : D
<RobotPinkie> You want it as a large PNG, Dman?
<Ignaesia> Look before you sleep is better than people give it credit for
<Dermathil> You read em?
<Dman> ...
<Dashite> ...
<Sathi> 7this movie... has a different intro :o
<Dashite> Someone needs to fix that graphic.
<herospirit> OH no. Oh no oh no. I don't know if I can take any more Buckaroo Banzai.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm highly surprised, but I did forget about Sonic Rainboom and FWF... which are incredibly popular.
<Dman> uuuhhh, mods, the nrew rules...well, the text...it's uh...pretty stretched out i have to say
<GGgala> Dman: they postd them earlier in chat, not up on the website yet: http://i55.tinypic.com/294kyzo.gif
<RainBroDash> 10yeah different intro :P
<Dman> RobotPinkie, i'd like that :3
<GGgala> oh wait you found it
<Dman> GGgala: yfw it's there in RULESA
<GGgala> and the text is way squashed
<PeanutButterWolf> LBYS is consistently regarded as the worst episode.
<Dman> also GGgala it's pretty stretched right?
<Sathi> 7they areup on the website
<Ziltoid> IMPOSSIBARU
<CrossBreeze> 12Meh, I forgot about Winter Wrap Up. Probably should have picked that.
<GGgala> DMan: mfw it wasn't an hour ago
<Dman> eyup sathi like I said :3
<Dman> lol GGgala
<Dashite> Yeah, rules graphic is squashed flat.
<Dman> very squishy I feel D:
<SirSprinkles> 6I believe dari put them on the site.
<ReticentSmolder> @Dman, I'm on Ridley right now
<RobotPinkie> How big, though, Dman? I mean that's a very clear pic, so I could probably mostly auto-vectorize and have it done in 10 minutes
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, new rules are up on the site.
<Dman> ReticentSmolder: yeeeaaa
<Sathi> 7also the rules look odd... on the website
<CrossBreeze> 12But FWF is still a really great one, def one of my favorites.
<GGgala> Dman: *refreshes* looks like they changed the URL but not the height/width attributes
<Ignaesia> Pinkie Keen usually gets more hate than LBYS
<PeanutButterWolf> Black Dynamite vs Buckaroo Banzai
<ReticentSmolder> wait...I just entered the room and he wasn't there...wtf?
<Dman> RobotPinkie, please, it's ar equest, so you can take your time =]. I wouldn't mind something 3 or 4 thousand long and however tall though ; )
<Dman> thanks!
<SirSprinkles> 6GGgala, yeah, I'll fix it when I get a moment, dari forgot to fix it.
<Sathi> 7I liked my intro more :P
<Nittany_Tiger> It's attached to his butt.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's because dari didn't fix the height/width of the image, and this one is MUCH larger than the old one.
<Dman> go SirSprinkles !!!
<PeanutButterWolf> Pinke Keen is merely the most loudly hated.
<prince-dari> I thought they looked weird.
<ReticentSmolder> oh, there he is :P, dun dundun DUN DUN dun dundun DUN DUN
<prince-dari> Assumed it was just the font or something.
<Ziltoid> I dont know why owlicious gets a bad wrap
<RobotPinkie> is it for you, dman or someone else?
<Ignaesia> so can somepony give me the sypnosis on this movie?
<Sumica> Rawhide is not a nickname one should have.
<Nittany_Tiger> Nopony likes Feeling Pinkie Keen?
<Dman> RobotPinkie: me of course! Ineed an epic vector to base my hairstyling from, and who else to turn to but yourself!
<GGgala> Sumica: better than Bareback
<Rezo> I hear it's the most australian movie since crocodile dundee
<Bjornfot> I missed this movie yesterday. I fell asleep in my armchair.
<RainBroDash> 10Ignaesia, lots of people say banzai, there's something about the 8th dimension, there was this thing, with some cowboys, oh and rock music.
<RobotPinkie> Ahh okay, cool, Dman
<Ignaesia> I like Pinkie Keen, it gets a bad rep cause ppl think the moral relates to religion
*Dman is having a very very hard time reading the new rules. : / dat stretch
<RainBroDash> 10lol bjornfot, you baller
<prince-dari> Pretty sure I didn't specify a height/width for the image though.
<herospirit> I like Pinkie Keen, people just don't like the moral I think is thing.

<Combustiblelemons> ohai guys
<Dman> RainBroDash, I did. I had to to read the new ones xD
<Sathi> 7lo Combustiblelemons
<PeanutButterWolf> Faust says the moral supposed to be connected to Dark matter and Quantum Physics... ...you know, for kids.

*Rezo dodges the inevitable flames after mentioning Party of One in the context of 'Bad'
<Ziltoid> lolwut?
<Ziltoid> really?
<ReticentSmolder> not...enough...MISSILES DAMN YOU RIDLEY
<[ger]Brony1> The worst episode is the glossy indians one.

<Combustiblelemons> what.
<GGgala> ReticentSmolder: congrats man!
<Ziltoid> um what
<Combustiblelemons> is that a flux capacitor?
<ReticentSmolder> Dman, Ridley is super fucking easy compared to his later iteration in Super Metroid
<Rezo> Looks pretty fluxy to me
<Combustiblelemons> this is some tron shit here
<Dman> ReticentSmolder: i no rite. gba games are sorta easy, but hella fun!
<prince-dari> "And yes, we have ways of knowing if your are ban evading"
<prince-dari> Dat lie
<prince-dari> XD
<Wrek> there, finally got some time off to watch this again! :D

<SirSprinkles> 6We... technically do.
<Combustiblelemons> .... alright, I missed a lot didn't i
<Rezo> >Show microbes as examples of interdimensional predators
<ReticentSmolder> ah, so its not nearly as hard as the famicom version?
<prince-dari> If they are using a proxy and a different nick we'll never know.
<Dman> :P
<Dman> not in my opinion, ReticentSmolder
<ReticentSmolder> well, I died once to Ridley, and 3 times to kraid >.>
<SirSprinkles> 6The html on the site is giving a size specification for the image.
<Dman> still is a Metroid game, bro

<RobotPinkie> That looks delicious
<AllisZero> I've been here since Goonies, Dman
<Rezo> Is that a... BRAIN?
<FreezeFrame> Ghosties: You know you're a wrestling fan when your first thought for Spanish class about writing an essay on a famous Hispanic person is to write about Eddie Guerrero
<Dman> ah, AllisZero, I got here like 10 mins ago - was out.
<PeanutButterWolf> |:-<
<FreezeFrame> Yes, that's what I did. And got an A :D
<AllisZero> But I flipped my monitor over to my drawing table and just watched
<Ghosties> 4>reads it, thinks Eddie when seeing the word "Spanish"
<AllisZero> Yup, we missed you
<Ghosties> 4So, yep. Awesome A by the way XD

<RobotPinkie> This movie blinded me.... with science....
<[ger]Brony1> In Soviet Russia time machine makes YOU!

<FreezeFrame> The essay was in Spanish, of course.

<hunty> really
<Umbreon> 12now you can go outside and watch it drf
<Sumica> armed
<drfsupercenter> 03though I'm honestly surprised we still have power
<FiveYearOldDamos> or a commercial pilot
<Umbreon> 12lightning never strikes in the sameplace :P
<Bjornfot> Oh SilverMane, I'm so lonely... Pegacorn is nowhere to be seen tonight! Please comfort meee! ;__;

<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<FiveYearOldDamos> LOL
<RobotPinkie> This is the A-movie, right?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why we got a generator, way too many power outages
<hunty> b movie\
<Umbreon> 12drf knowing you you probably have backup generators that can power your house for 2 years
<ctr> No it's "Little Mac's trainer stole my bike"
<prince-dari> Kicking doesn't do anything.
<RobotPinkie> nowai
<drfsupercenter> 03Umbreon, no
<hunty> buuckaroo banzai
<prince-dari> You have to wait for the nick to timeout.
<Sathi> grrr
<Bjornfot> o robotpinkie u so crazy
<Ghosties> 4Sathi, were you blaaaaaaaa
<Sumica> it's big bootay!
<drfsupercenter> 03our generator can power our house forever
<Sathi> that was so annoying
<drfsupercenter> 03but it runs off natural gase
<drfsupercenter> 03-e
<Dman> RobotPinkie u know goonies was A movee :D
<Sathi> took over 6 mins
<Rezo> I think we had two B movies tonight :o
<Ghosties> 4So you were blaaaaaa
<Umbreon> 12so if the gas stations run out of gas
<Sathi> yes
<Umbreon> 12then you are screwed :P
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Combustiblelemons> ...and not a single fuck was given that day.
<prince-dari> Little Mac?
<drfsupercenter> 03natural gas comes from the power plant dude
<prince-dari> Wut.
<soltha> Hey everypony. How is the movie goign?
<soltha> going?
<SilverMane> I'm sorry Bjornfot, I have other priorities to manage. I give you permission to harrass mai waifu for a little while though
<Dman> Rezo, goonies is A movie clearly :3
<FiveYearOldDamos> bbl town
<RobotPinkie> No but seriously, just because something is funny doesn't mean it's a B movie
<Umbreon> 12if the power plants ever shut down
<Umbreon> 12you are screwed
<GGgala> soltha: like a bad acid trip
<Sumica> it's going crazy
<Sathi> I asked you to link me the safety dance then I crashed
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, in the case of a zombie apocalypse, we are
<soltha> cool
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<Ghosties> 4Hold on
<Combustiblelemons> Goonies is supposed to be funny.

<Bjornfot> rainbrodaaash~
<Dman> RainBroDash, does SilverMane care?
<hunty> i think goonies is over
<Dman> sure is hunty
<hunty> drats
<Sathi> yay thanks
<AllisZero> I haven't shed tears in the last ten years
<Dman> Everypony: Is NewDCD / somemodelse doing after-show?
<Sumica> yes cause lizzardi and wizzard are easily mistaken.
<AllisZero> Why do I have my eyes wet reading a Rainbow Dash comic on DA?
<Rezo> >not shedding tears of joy during sonic raijnboom
<AllisZero> This show is full of witchcraft, I tell you
<Sathi> and now to put it on loop :)
<Bjornfot> link allliszero
<Ignaesia> I shed manly tears during At the Gala when I watched it live
<Dman> AllisZero, which one? the one with her being olda t the end? link?
<hunty> was up all night reading dr whooves fan fic and slept through the goonies
<SilverMane> Buckaroo Banzai: This movie was intended to be A-movie quality when it was made. Apparently they didn't realize how insane the script was
<AllisZero> http://fluttershy-fans.deviantart.com/gallery/30804150#/d45iyxw
<RainBroDash> 10bjornfot. don't give me those eyes. I'm not swayed as easily as PEGACRON
<Dman> Bjornfot: You can just type 'al' and hit TAB. do it, colt!
<Combustiblelemons> meh nothing reduces me to tears after watching it
<Dman> AllisZero: http://th00.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2011/224/c/1/_____but_it_wasn__t_my_fault___by_glancojusticar-d45iyxw.jpg
<Dman> remember to post picture, AllisZero by right clicking opening in new tab, and taking THAT URL and pasting it here :3
<Sumica> pack his saddle bags? But he's not a pony.
<AllisZero> Yes that
<RobotPinkie> lolol, some jackass is going to complain about this, but seriously, this movie has a ridiculous amount of good actors in it.
<SilverMane> RainBroDash, i said he can harass you; i didn't say you wouldn't beat the tar our of him for it
<Dman> true dat SilverMane
<Rezo> So... A movie that's trying too hard to be A, and thus fails at even being B?
<Dman> Rezo, thus by definition a B movie :3 hahaha
<Dman> even thou it fails at being B, that makes it B lol
<Ignaesia> Did anypony ever see that comic where the events at the end of Sonic Rainboom didn't happen as RD failed the sonic rainboom and KOed herself, everything was her in a coma
<Combustiblelemons> What is this jerry springer?
<Dman> ...no, Ignaesia, but that sounds cryworthy ;__;
<SilverMane> also, Bjornfot, remember. Mai Waifu RainBroDash is very special to me. You hurt him, and I hurt you. With a wrench.
<Ignaesia> yeah it was dman...
<Rezo> Well.. A B movie that knows its a B movie and acts accordingly is a great B movie. A B movie that thinks it's an A movie on the other hand, is a shitty B movie
<Bjornfot> Oh SilverMane, you naughty pony...
<RainBroDash> 10oh dear.
<SilverMane> Yes?
<Combustiblelemons> Still better than spiders web.
<Dman> so...SilverMane, you gave permission to harrass RainBroDash, but so that RainBroDash would fight back, and you would then dfend him? so like, you basically set up an ambush for Bjornfot ?
<SilverMane> Dman, stop reading the script
<Sathi> 7Combustiblelemons: everything beats that movie
<Rezo> Spiders Web is a true work of art. We should watch it aga- *is banned*
<Dman> goes without saying, comb
<hunty> oooooh
<AllisZero> If you can dodge a Dashie you can dodge a wrench?
<hunty> clever
<Dman> Combustiblelemons: *
<Bjornfot> >implying I'm not a Viking who can do anything
<RainBroDash> 10^
<RobotPinkie> In what way does this movie try to be something it's not? They were obviously aware of how silly the concept was.
<Ignaesia> Cmon guiz, no A vs B movie arguments. I think this was added to the rules due to the scott pilgrim debacle
<Bjornfot> I think I can manage
<Dman> Rezo be trollin'
<hunty> lol desktop ponies
<Dman> A ROCK!
<Barry1> Then Dragon Wars is a good B movie according to your logic Rezo
<GGgala> Ignaesia: there was a Scott Pilgrim debacle?
*GGgala missed the Friday Scott Pilgrim showing
<Rezo> No idea, I haven't seen it
<Dman> GGgala, feelsbadpony. you're here NOW though and that's what counts!
<SilverSonic|Live> Hope you enjoyed the show AE :3
<Bjornfot> ÅVÄTHRASTA
<hunty> its good
<Ignaesia> GGgala, yes as it was rejected one week for the B movie but accepted as an A movie and there is conflicting opinions over what its classified as
<GGgala> Dman: true dat
<hunty> its an A movie
<Combustiblelemons> baby bang? ._.
<GGgala> Ignaesia: ...ah. That does sound like a recipe for wank
<Barry1> Dragon Wars is a movie on the same level as Godzilla in terms of movie levels
<hunty> the porduction value is rather high
<Dman> indeedio
<hunty> which qualifies it as an A movie
<Ignaesia> hunty it has an A movie budget but its aimed at a niche/cult group which makes it B it was also not critically recieved that well
<Bjornfot> l8r
<Barry1> What you talking about?
<Ignaesia> so there was alot of arguing about it
<Barry1> Scott Pilgrim?
<drfsupercenter> 03and, time to try Dream world again
<hunty> but everyone i met loves that movie
<Nittany_Tiger> You know what's funny. Banzai was driving on the Bonneville Salt Flats in the beginning of the movie. That's in Nevada, not Texas.
<RobotPinkie> Lets talk about ponies instead.
<AllisZero> RobotPinkie: I agree to that
<herospirit> there's the 8th dimension part of things.
<Dman> i say, RobotPinkie, any tips for Fluttershy hair?
<hunty> i like blues
<Dman> (srsly)
<Ignaesia> Pinkie Pie is best pony
<hunty> the pony blues
<Barry1> Who's your favorite pony?
<Dman> Barry1: ERRYPONY! \o/
<GGgala> President Madagascar! A man in Brazil is coughing!
<AllisZero> SHUT
<AllisZero> DOWN
<hunty> blues is the best ponie, hes been confirmed for season 2
<AllisZero> EVERYTHING.
<Barry1> If you had to pick just one, which would it be?
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Combustiblelemons> zappity zap zap
<prince-dari> Pandemic.
<Sathi> 7all ponies is best pony
*GGgala brohoofs AllisZero
<Dman> true dat sathi
<Dman> very true
<Barry1> That's not one
<Ignaesia> >aliens speak english
<Ignaesia> >wat
*Umbreon gives drfsupercenter a pizza with anchovies
<SilverMane> so Prince-Dari, how far did you get into that cave in Durrrrgan
<hunty> i like zacora
<herospirit> Sathi is correct.
<drfsupercenter> 03ew
<hunty> but shes a zebra
<Combustiblelemons> so a giant beet heads towards earth and noone sees it.
<drfsupercenter> 03I only like plain cheese or pepperoni
<drfsupercenter> 03not fish
<prince-dari> I dunno, I stopped when I got to a save crystal.
<prince-dari> Was really late.
*AllisZero brohoofs GGgala
<prince-dari> Early.
<prince-dari> Same thing.
<Barry1> still qualifies as a pony, unlike some other characters in the serues
<RobotPinkie> Brush the front part of her hair out gently, don't pull too hard, it's better with repeated strokes to even it out it seems. That's about my only tip, Dman. :P
<Rezo> what the hell
<Aeroslash> !thriller
*lightumbreon grabs crotch and moonwalks out of the room

<SilverMane> SONIC screwdrivers?
<Combustiblelemons> so basically aliens from another dimension have come to invade planet earth and some crazy scientist is helping them
<Umbreon> 12.
<Umbreon> 12that's a script now?
<RainBroDash> 10dari, you're a cunt
<prince-dari> SilverMane: THAT NEEDS TO BE A DRINK
<AllisZero> Argh, I'm gonna go take a shower this is never going to work if I don't start
<Aeroslash> yup
<RainBroDash> 10someone did that to me.
<hunty> no the scientist has one of them in his brain
<Angel_Espeon> 13For some reason, yes
<Angel_Espeon> 13o-o
<Dman> RainBroDash, and why is that?
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, it IS a drink!
<prince-dari> Wut
<RainBroDash> 10They put Ouzo in my unmixed pepsi max.....
<lightumbreon> 06erm
<Combustiblelemons> ahh ok
<Umbreon> 12drf didn't you have that set to an autokill word once?
<RobotPinkie> dat greenscreen
<Umbreon> 12XD
<lightumbreon> 06i can explain the o3o script
<RainBroDash> 10so for replicating their actions i hate you XD
<Barry1> a screwdriver is an alcoholic mixed drink
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<lightumbreon> 06actually
<drfsupercenter> 03lightumbreon
<lightumbreon> 06i cant
<Dman> HAHAHAHA RainBroDash what a story mark, that's hillarious
<RainBroDash> 10basically i woke up hungover
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<drfsupercenter> 03get rid of that script
*lightumbreon RUNS
<drfsupercenter> 03we've already asked you nicely
<drfsupercenter> 03to get rid of it
<RainBroDash> 10drank so much accidental ouzo
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, if you can think of it from a nerdy, geeky, or gamer show/game/movie, it's probably a drink
<prince-dari> You just mad because you didn't find my house in time.
<RobotPinkie> Silvermare needs to be a drink? Wut?
<lightumbreon> 06no-one said i should get rid of it
<RainBroDash> 10got absolutely slammed first thing in the morning again by accident
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<Umbreon> 12oh relax drf
<Barry1> that's for those who don't know
<RainBroDash> 10greaaaaaaaat
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm pretty sure Aurora told you to get rid of that too
<drfsupercenter> 03as there's no point to that script besides pissing me off >_>
<Aeroslash> oh wow, lower your hackles, Danny
<Dman> xD
<Combustiblelemons> lol RBD
<lightumbreon> 06nope, she never told me too, only if people would ABUSE it
<Barry1> who drinks first thing in the morning?!
<GGgala> RobotPinkie: <SilverMane> SONIC screwdriver?
<Umbreon> 12drf just ignore lightumbreon
<Aeroslash> it's two oh's and a number 3
<Umbreon> 12XD
<Combustiblelemons> not me
<RobotPinkie> Oh, well that makes sense then
<Combustiblelemons> only on fridays for me.
<Dman> sure it does
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, and swear words are just various letters
<drfsupercenter> 03what of it
<drfsupercenter> 03that does't mean it's not bad
<lightumbreon> 06but since no-one EVER abused my scripts, i'm not going to de-activate them
<prince-dari> There is also an alcoholic drink called a sonic screwdriver, made by combining – 1 1/2 oz Vanilla Vodka – 1 1/2 oz Blue Curaçao (liqueur) – 6 oz Clear Lemon-Lime Soda
<prince-dari> AWESOME
<RainBroDash> 10WIN
<Dman> nice
<RainBroDash> 10dari make me one
*ctr backs away slowly
<GGgala> excellent
<RobotPinkie> It's a screwdriver with something blue in it?
<Barry1> lol
<prince-dari> I don't have any of the drinks needed. :<
<hunty> hypnotic?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I can understand both sides of this, but I'm leaning more towards drf on this one
<Combustiblelemons> it's a rastafarian!
<Dman> "The "Sonic Screwdriver" recipe was invented by Liz Mulhern of Omaha Nebraska, as a "companion" drink to go along with her favorite TV show. This recipe was inspired by (and named for) the tool of choice used by the main character in the BBC Sci-Fi show "Doctor Who". Read more: Sonic Screwdriver recipe http://www.drinksmixer.com/drinkb1c6388.html#ixzz1VbdyI
<Barry1> a what?!
<RainBroDash> 10dari my mate has the blue curacao. fund it
<Dman> Crap didn't mean to copy link too! so sorry!
<RobotPinkie> screwdriver+blueberry schnapps?
<hunty> hypnotic is blue flavored vodka
<Angel_Espeon> 13It'll take a lot of convincing to get me to believe you made the script for a purpose other than to annoy him :P
<Pegacorn> I'M BACK
<Combustiblelemons> electricity smells?
<Ignaesia> wait, smell electricity?!
<AllisZero> Wtf
<FreezeFrame> Yes, you can.
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<Pegacorn> So,what did i miss?
<Barry1> electricity is supposed to smell of ozone
<lightumbreon> 06why would i even think about annoying drf? i first thought he was joking, and now he's serious..well, no point going into that xD
<FreezeFrame> Arcing electricity through the air creates ozone, which has a distinct odor.
<drfsupercenter> 03I can intentionally annoy certain people too, but I'm above that
<Nittany_Tiger> There's Old Gary.
<drfsupercenter> 03unlike some :/
<Barry1> or so I've heard
<hunty> yeah smells like o-zone
<Ignaesia> ah I didnt know that
<Umbreon> 12yeah drf already did plenty of that in the past :P
<Pegacorn> BUCKAROO WAZZAP
<hunty> so tesla coils are good for the enviornment?
<Ghosties> 4Guys, I updated the Steam page for the upcoming LotR special next week
<Dman> "The end result is still an orange flavored vodka beverage, but it is now sweeter, bubbly, and a striking blue color that exactly matches the business end of the instrument used in "Doctor Who"... A Sonic Screwdriver." So it's blue and taste like ... prince-dari, what was that one fruit you related with RainBroDash ?
<Combustiblelemons> ozone is made when electricity arcs through oxygen
<Umbreon> 12he's hip and up with the times
<Combustiblelemons> so electricity can't exactly smell :)
<prince-dari> Satsuma
<Sathi> yea I got popups ;)
<RobotPinkie> ohshi- I recognize him
<Dman> :3 ikr prince-dari
<RainBroDash> 10Satsuma XD
<Pegacorn> oshi-
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I did too XD
<Barry1> curse cut short
<GGgala> Bjornfot and Pegacorn in the chat at once? ohshi--
<Dman> Pegacorn is here?
<Ignaesia> Satsumas are awesome
<Dman> FFUU
<prince-dari> GGgala: LOL
<prince-dari> INB4 Rape
<Bjornfot> PEGACOOOOOOOOOORN<3<3<3<3<3
<Barry1> atomic f-bomb cut short
<Pegacorn> Ohai Bjornfot
<Dman> Bjornfot: PEGACROOOOOOOOOOOON. FTFY
<lightumbreon> 06meh, IF i annoy pweople, thats because i'm either being a troll because they did something, or any other specialr easong not to be mentioned in open
<RobotPinkie> yup, that was clancy brown, I knew it.
<GGgala> Dman: you used it! :D
<HyperMetalLugia> Many typos
<lightumbreon> 06but mainly i make these scripts for shitz and giggles
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03watch your language
<ctr> Anyway
<HyperMetalLugia> Or for being an idiot .c.
<ctr> That script is totally useless
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<Dman> lol
<prince-dari> I'll ask my parents to get me some blue curacao then.
<Umbreon> 12i don't quite agree with the situation but let me put it like this, everytime someone activates that script
<Umbreon> 12this is going to start all over again lightumbreon
<lightumbreon> 06but if you REALLY hate the script, and i mean HATE, i will de-activate it, not delete
<Umbreon> 12so really there is no point to having that script
<Combustiblelemons> *stands around a possibly radioactive ball*
<EdwardNewgate> Leaves from the vine
<Combustiblelemons> such logic :/
<AllisZero> The.
<AllisZero> Fuck.
<Dman> do it prince-dari
<EdwardNewgate> Falling so slow
<drfsupercenter> 03see
<lightumbreon> 06alright then... if you guys insist
<AllisZero> Twi's eyes look... brown in S2
<drfsupercenter> 03Aurora told me that she told you to disable it
<Pegacorn> BUCKAROO WAZZAP
<drfsupercenter> 03but apparently youd idn't listen LOL
<RainBroDash> 10dari
<RainBroDash> 10do it
<herospirit> SAY WAT.
<Ignaesia> Attack of the Killer Tomatoes made more sense than this movie
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah
<hunty> the are brown?
<Pegacorn> lol
<lightumbreon> 06she never told me to get rid of it nor disable
<drfsupercenter> 03my days of intentionally annoying certain people is over
<RainBroDash> 10BAKALOO
<EdwardNewgate> Like fragile tiny shells
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm trying to be nicer *cough* giving you a free game code*cough*
<lightumbreon> 06only if the script was causing trouble OR getting abused
<Umbreon> 12drf
<RobotPinkie> That's true, but that's because Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was a masterpiece.
<drfsupercenter> 03it causes trouble in that people use it just to annoy me
<Umbreon> 12i don't think you intentionally annoyed anyone
<EdwardNewgate> Drifting in the foam
<Umbreon> 12your personality was just unlikeable
<Umbreon> 12XD
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03but then people are all
<lightumbreon> 06i know DRF, i never wanted to annoy you in the first place xd
<drfsupercenter> 03"Stop being so annoying"
<lightumbreon> 06*xD
<EdwardNewgate> Little Soldier boy
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03I know I talk fast
<hunty> foam
<EdwardNewgate> Come marching home
<drfsupercenter> 03but why am I so hateable :<
<SilverMane> Oh prince-dari; want to know why you need to make it to at least chapter 3 in Mardek?
<hunty> home
<lightumbreon> 06disabled
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm a complete grammar/spelling nazi by heart, but I only correct people who I know won't get all annoyed over it :3c
<drfsupercenter> 03It's not my fault that most people here like products that I don't XD
<lightumbreon> 06someone try !030?
<EdwardNewgate> Brave soldier boy
<herospirit> formula give
<EdwardNewgate> Comes marching home
<GGgala> EdwardNewgate: ;_;
<Umbreon> 12i think in the past
<Umbreon> 12you were kind of a "know it all"
<lightumbreon> 06to test if it IS de-activated?
<EdwardNewgate> mfw I just saw that episode
<Aeroslash> !030
<drfsupercenter> 03like on #P-O, I almost never see anything pro-Apple
<drfsupercenter> 03and when we do talk about it,e veryone's in agreement that they suck :P
<drfsupercenter> 03speaking of which
<drfsupercenter> 03I bought two tablets

<HyperMetalLugia> Niice
<ctr> HP they discontinued their tablets :P
<drfsupercenter> 03ctr

<junh1024-XD> me , fma & puto ?
<Combustiblelemons> the alien doesn't give a shit
<ctr> so early :/
<HyperMetalLugia> How is WebOS?
<drfsupercenter> 03HP TouchPad
<drfsupercenter> 03HML
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't actually have it yet
<drfsupercenter> 03I ordered it
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh

<lightumbreon> 06yep, !o3o is disabled :3
<EdwardNewgate> I teared up during the song
<drfsupercenter> 03will be here on... Wednesday?
<HyperMetalLugia> Okay then xD
<RobotPinkie> Reptile?
<Angel_Espeon> 13When I think of tablets, I either think of medicine tablets or drawing tablets o-o
<ctr> they should've had some more patience
<hunty> ATlA?
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah ctr
<Barry1> Rainbrodash: What the hay is a Bakaloo?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why they were so cheap
<Pegacorn> Reptile?
<EdwardNewgate> Avatar the last airbender
<Espeon> 06o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03HP discontinued the TouchPad and made them $100
<drfsupercenter> 03instead of $500
<hunty> oooooh
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
<Ghosties> 4Doc Brown PUNCH!
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 17 minutes
<drfsupercenter> 03so I was like DO WANT and bought two
<Dman> KIACK
<Pegacorn> Where's Reptile?I don't see him!
<drfsupercenter> 03I would have gotten more, but it was a limit of two per person LOL
<ctr> XD
<GGgala> Luckily, aliens have balls too!
<Dermathil> dat truck
<drfsupercenter> 03and see
<herospirit> BANZAI!
<drfsupercenter> 03Office Depot is sold out again
<drfsupercenter> 03so I HOPE they can actually ship mine :/
<Ghosties> 4Oh yeah, Silverscreen made a Reptile reference last night during this part
<drfsupercenter> 03though hmm
<drfsupercenter> 03what I could do
<Combustiblelemons> so all the aliens are bad?
<drfsupercenter> 03is just go to the store
<Pegacorn> OUTRUN A TRUCK,LIKE A BAWS
<Rezo> This scene totally doesn't reference terminator I & II
<Ignaesia> We totally need Mortal Kombat: Annihilation in here sometime
<drfsupercenter> 03as they said that they'll match the price of officedepot.com
<GGgala> Barry1: "Buccaroo" in a terrible accent
<drfsupercenter> 03which has the $149.99 for the 32GB
<Combustiblelemons> HELICOPTER OUT OF NOWHERE
<Pegacorn> MK:A was good in my opinion.
<herospirit> BUKALOO BANZAI
<HyperMetalLugia> 16GB is the $100 I suppose
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> Not bad
<RobotPinkie> bakayarou banzai
<Ghosties> 4I'd be all for showing MK as A film and Annihilation as B film
<drfsupercenter> 03and I mean, I want as much space as possible LOL
<Pegacorn> dat Commodore 64
<drfsupercenter> 03so I got the 32GB for $150
<drfsupercenter> 03times two
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll probably just sell one to somebody
<hunty> mk?
<HyperMetalLugia> 64GB of tablet storage xD
<drfsupercenter> 03and keep the other
<SirSprinkles> 6FUCKAYOU IMHAI
<Pegacorn> Ghosties,YES PLZ
<GGgala> G-Cipher? It's just that easy.
<hunty> what is MK?
<drfsupercenter> 03they actually have a 64GB TouchPad
<Ghosties> 4MK as in the first Mortal Kombat film
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's extremely hard to find :|
<Ignaesia> true, the first MK movie isn't that bad and has some good fight scenes. MK:A is lulz
<hunty> oh
<HyperMetalLugia> Yet, what is there to download that uses up 32_ GB
<drfsupercenter> 03and not on sale
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm Old Gary.
<HyperMetalLugia> Aha
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL HML
<drfsupercenter> 03you obviously don't know me
<Rezo> Ghosties: I totally approve
<hunty> you and your acronyms
<drfsupercenter> 3Total Free: 5570.41 GB/18630.02 GB
<Pegacorn> dat guy
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm using over 10TB right now
<HyperMetalLugia> Will the tablet replace the Zune?
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<GGgala> Mortal Kombat?
<Pegacorn> JOHN
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Ghosties> 4Except MK has ALWAYS been an acronym for the series X3
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't fit a 10" tablet in your pocket
<drfsupercenter> 03unless you have HUGE pockets
<Ghosties> 4Yes, GGgala
<hunty> psh...
<drfsupercenter> 03so yeah, nothing will ever replace my 120GB Zune LOL
<hunty> i knew that
<Dman> FINISH HIAM! FEITALITEE
<hunty> ...
<EspyLacopa> Huh, another season of Zero no Tsukaima.
<HyperMetalLugia> Hahah
<Pegacorn> MK is one of my favorite video game series of all time.
<HyperMetalLugia> So what do you plan to use the tablet for anyway?
<Pegacorn> Dem Johns
<hunty> i cant stand shiva
<Combustiblelemons> john conner...?
<GGgala> John O'Connor?
<drfsupercenter> 03mainly just trying it out
<Ignaesia> hey its that dude from Jurassic Park
<Pegacorn> John ConnOr.
<Rezo> In b4 cybernetic killing machine
<hunty> and ghost busters
<drfsupercenter> 03why would I actually *need* a tablet if I have a laptop
<HyperMetalLugia> Same idea here :P
<Nittany_Tiger> John Small Berries?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why I can't understand why anyone would actually want an iPad
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03those things are like $600
<drfsupercenter> 03you can get a laptop for $300 now
<hunty> john big booty
*Umbreon breaks all the zunes in the world to see what drf does
<drfsupercenter> 03laptops have more storage andw ay more featurtes...
<drfsupercenter> 03*features
<Pegacorn> Who you gonna call?Someone else.
<drfsupercenter> 03but I mean hey
<drfsupercenter> 03getting a $600 tablet for $150? Sure
<HyperMetalLugia> I think that is why the tablet failed in 2003~ xD
<RobotPinkie> any true MK fan has fought Reptile in the first game.
<Pegacorn> (lol Casper)
<drfsupercenter> 03if they had iPads for $150 I'd buy a bunch and then sell them to fanboys
<Ignaesia> RobotPInkie in the pit!
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Combustiblelemons> who read war of the worlds over the radio?
<hunty> is it racist the black kid is named casper?
<HyperMetalLugia> Or just raise them to 500 and make epic profit
<Combustiblelemons> whoever it was they are pro trolls
<HyperMetalLugia> Either way, they'll fall for it
<RobotPinkie> That was just brilliant, btw, having a hidden boss like that.
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the idea
<Pegacorn> I didn't fight Reptile in the first MK since i never got far because of the goddamn diffuculty.
<GGgala_> fuckin' internet
<Dermathil> dat jump
<drfsupercenter> 03incidentally, my friend does the same thing with cars
<drfsupercenter> 03he buys used cars and sells them, makes money
<drfsupercenter> 03I should ask if he can get me a car :/
<Nittany_Tiger> Old Gary can jump.
<Pegacorn> Lemons,it was Orson Welles.
<Ignaesia> Combustiblelemons WotW was a radio dramatic reading, but it was so realistically sounding that some towns believed we really were being invaded
<Ghosties> 4I fought him, RobotPinkie
<HyperMetalLugia> Two accidents in a row
<RobotPinkie> Pegacorn, you can finish the entire game with every character without seeing Reptile
<HyperMetalLugia> How
<Pegacorn> dat shot
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03wait what
<drfsupercenter> 03no?>
<drfsupercenter> 03only the one accident
<Combustiblelemons> I know it was. Just I forgot who read it
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm spending a fortune fixing my car
<Ignaesia> ahh ok
<drfsupercenter> 03and my friend was like "You should just sell that before it completely breaks down"
<Barry1> Is this Goonies or Buckaroo Banzai?
<Pegacorn> JOHN FINFOOK
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean, two car screwups
<HyperMetalLugia> Haha
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently the blue-book value is like $5000
<drfsupercenter> 03for my car
<Ghosties> 4And Pegacorn, you think MK1 is difficult?
<desertman2> BB
<Dermathil> 2nd movie, Barry
<drfsupercenter> 03which is more than I expected for an 11 year old SUV
<Ghosties> 4Play MKII
<Ignaesia> no fat kids, so its not goonies
<Barry1> ah, so I missed the lottery
<Ghosties> 4Now that game *trembles*
<HyperMetalLugia> Nice, a SUV
<HyperMetalLugia> Hrm
<Ignaesia> ever fight kintaro on MK2? yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03SUVs are nice
<Combustiblelemons> also, no sloth, so it's not the goonies
<Umbreon> 12heh
<Pegacorn> ALL MK games are hard to me.
<drfsupercenter> 03they just have CRAPPY gas mileagfe
<drfsupercenter> 03-f
<drfsupercenter> 03guess how many miles per gallon I get :/
<Umbreon> 12i have an 07 PT Cruiser
<HyperMetalLugia> 12?
<Umbreon> 12silly things
<drfsupercenter> 03close
<Pegacorn> Except the new ones.
<drfsupercenter> 03about 13
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Ghosties> 4Ever fight Shao Kahn? Yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03but I mean
