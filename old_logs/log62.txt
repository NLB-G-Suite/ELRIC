<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Rarity's wings might be a reference to the Flutter Ponies of the old My Little Pony series in 1986, whose sheer butterfly wings were notoriously fragile. The wings are also reminiscent of the Breezies in the direct to video movie My Little Pony: The Princess Promenade in 2006.

<SomethingDifferent> OM NOM NOM
<Silverscreen> 11possibly a boloney sandwich. Applejack almost even ate the said sandwich. These hints may be accidents on the part of the production staff, as meat should not be part of the ponies' diet.
