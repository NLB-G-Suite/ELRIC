<fesoferbex> lack of sleep is killing you all slowly...and it's hiliarious
<MakerDusk> :D
<Shizuka> 13seems for most cases the player detects it's been used in an iframe and locks out
<Octavia_> So much style.
<Scotty211> That was glorious
<BlaxBlain> Cheese in rice!
<Tomtortoise> YES!!! ALL MY YES!
<Jewelscore> YEEEAH!
<MakerDusk> shhhh, fesoferbex, you never let them know that as it's happening ;)
<Shizuka> 13i attempted to exploit my embed switcher plugin to use the <object> tag set twitch demands you use, and failed!
<BlaxBlain> What is with this game and burning people!
<YokusaHHart> ._.
<Valnar1001> Nope
<Shizuka> 13so the embed switcher cannot be used to inject code yaaaaaay
<Carrot_Top> YEAH
<fesoferbex> @MD, sorry /)_- you're right!
<BlaxBlain> "Burning people he says what we are all thinking"~GLaDos
<shana> what about good old iframe Shizuka?
*YokusaHHart has a phobia of house fires ._.
<shana> ups sorry :D
<Carrot_Top> WOOO
<Shizuka> 13we're built on iframe, twitch forbids the player being embedded in iframe
<Octavia_> I've got a challeng for one who want it : Sing Giggle at the gostly. ( The end is quite difficult because you have to sing at the same rapidity like Pinkie. 8D )
<Shizuka> 13you can embed chat in iframe, which is pretty stupid
<stallion1> ok IM not getting any kind of video feed
<Lingonrise_> Can someone sing the cupcake song? Pretty please?
<cachi01|corpseparty> FIIIGHT MAH BROTHEEEERRSS

<Everlasting_Joy> Kandarihu: Magic.
<cachi01|corpseparty> Kandarihu: easy. alliers have green names
<AlexSparkle> Question at Perry: Would you mind singing Discord, the Living Tombstone remix?
<pony_429860> Question: JJ, who do you prefer? Molestia? or Gamer Luna?
<cachi01|corpseparty> Kandarihu: enemies have nothing

<silence> I am now silence
<cachi01|corpseparty> allies*

<Alchemist> Kandarihu: friendlies have nametags when they are in your crosshairs
<cachi01|corpseparty> ehrmagerd frendly fier wil naht be toleratud
<Kandarihu> I see, okay
<Yavos> Considering you thought about an own song and we have a fandom with many talented musicians... Why don't you try to combine these two facts? ;D

<silence> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> in fact, from now on ill do it constantly :>
<thelonepony> But sprunkls is true trollolol
<Buytoast> that isn't really trolling
<Everlasting_Joy> alexxm: If the Wii has been any indicator of how it has handled updates, all of the pieces act as their own "system". In other words, you have to update every individual piece at seperate times as opposed to all at once.
<x404compliant> its back. seems switching streams now requires proper referrers to be sent.
<cachi01|Blackcops2Za> twoiloight wat r u doin?
<BlazingDawn> Question - If you were trapped with the other artists in this stream, in an elevator, for 3 days... What do?
<Buytoast> that's more a little kid calling someone stupid because they're the one who's mad
<cachi01|Blackcops2Za> sprunkls
<Bronysith> no one in here is a troll besides prince-dari

<Everlasting_Joy> Take care SuperBrony64!
<Invi> thank you for streaming SB :3
<alexxm> thanks for the stream SuperBrony64
<thelonepony> :3
<Wreck-It-Pokemon_> did I quit, no
<Wreck-It-Pokemon_> XD
<Kujo_Jojo> Thanks SuperBrony64
<Wreck-It-Pokemon_> i'll be back, i'm streaming now.. they inspired me.
<alexxm> welp seems like my internet isn't being turned off
<Zebranky> Galacon and BronyCon are the same weekend, so, uh, good luck with that :)
<Yavos> It would be better. Celestia, the almighty overlord would make us happy with her magic and if that doesn't work, there's still princess Cadence :D
<Alma> Is anyone as disappointed by yesterday's episode as I am?
<CrystalPhoenix> I know I may be annoying but noone here having an opinion on what microphone is good?
<MLP_Brovakiin> thanks for the stream SuperBrony64 :)
<Kujo_Jojo> alexxm good
<twilight_sprinkle> thenkuu for streamoo SuperBrony64
<CrystalPhoenix> Alma, I LOVED it
<Zebranky> It's going to be awesome, though
<Alma> CrystalPhoenix: There was WAY too much fan-service in that episode and too little content
<Everlasting_Joy> CrystalPhoenix: What kind of microphone are you looking for?
<BlazingDawn> Just teleport
<Tomtortoise> This is THE, Worst, Possible, Thing!
<CrystalPhoenix> Alma, you look too much into it
<CrystalPhoenix> there was no fan-service
<Alma> They shouldn't concentrate so much on making the episodes for the Bronies
<Swagestia> finally i ended that pm with cachi01
<cachi01|Blackcops2Za> thelonepony twilight_sprinkle MLP_Brovakiin http://pastebin.com/m9REUGWL
<alexxm> but if it is being turned off bye in advance
<Venus> 08,01CrystalPhoenix: depends what you want it for
<CrystalPhoenix> Everlasting_Joy, one of high quality for voice work
<Venus> 08,01CrystalPhoenix: Sontronics STC-2S is good for large areas
<twilight_sprinkle> dude cachi01|Blackcops2Za not cool
<Venus> 08,01and reasonably cheap
<twilight_sprinkle> pms are pms for a reason
<Mockery> I want to see JJ (if he can) draw Fluttershy as Sleeping Beauty
<twilight_sprinkle> its not right to then take them and post to everyone
<cachi01|Blackcops2Za> twoiloight pls. this guy had it coming
<Zebranky> I hate linecons. It's hard to avoid, though.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Change in plans, going to keep streaming~
<twilight_sprinkle> no he didnt, you insulted him first
<MLP_Brovakiin> cachi01|Blackcops2Za: Thanks for making me laugh out loud and spit my tea out :D
<Zebranky> Especially for autographs. The math is hard to make work out nicely.
<Yavos> @JJ you have been to many cons this year. Don't you think you might overdo it with being at every single one of them? xD
<alexxm> woo
<thelonepony> cachi01|Blackcops2Za: :D
*DoctoDoctorWho cautiously pokes into chat
<cachi01|Blackcops2Za> MLP_Brovakiin: lol u welcome
<CrystalPhoenix> Alma, what exactly have they implanted to please Bronies?
<thelonepony> Yay :D
<Swagestia> i'm still here cachi01
<cachi01|Blackcops2Za> twilight_sprinkle: yep i did. but at first it was joke lol then shit got real
<AlexSparkle> I actually didn't say she have to sing it !
<Alma> CrystalPhoenix: That previous generation Pinkie Pie face. That extreme example of Pinkie Pie breaking the laws of physics
<Scotty211> Oh guys, I have a good idea. Since JJ can't decide to go to Gala or Bronycon. We should make a clone of JJ just like from pinkie pie episode. :D
<CrystalPhoenix> Alma, that wasn't fan-service
<Alma> No, of course not
<majsman12> just a tip don´t go to sweden during winter. It´s just cold and rainy
<MadSurge> Alma: and hooffingers
<Swagestia> lol
<cachi01|Blackcops2Za> wow 24 hours ban
<cachi01|Blackcops2Za> that was unexpected :$
<CrystalPhoenix> so they cannot make jokes anymore?
<Weatherhoof> Carrot Top by Putuk: https://www.dropbox.com/s/1jxlgb4vkq3um9z/CARROTEATINGCARROT.png
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> MadSurge: :D ikr Lyra would be WTF
<silence> hmmm maby
<DoctoDoctorWho> Alma: Thats like recording a fat lady jiggle dancing naked and calling it quality porn.
<Alma> lol... YES. They can not make jokes anymore
<Zebranky> Say 1000 people want autographs, and each autograph takes only 45 seconds (barely enough time to say hi). That's over 22 hours of autograph time.
<Kujo_Jojo> DoctoDoctorWho welcome back teacher
<Zebranky> Really sucks. :/
<CrystalPhoenix> but seriously there was no fan-pandering
<Alma> No, of course there wasn't
<silence> wait wait
<JohnnyNorthrain> Question @JJ, Are you going to do more Human Daring Do or is she pretty much done?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Kujo_Jojo: Good eavening student
<Venusy> @majsman12 The UK is cold and rainy all year round!
<CrystalPhoenix> Alma, don't get sacarstic in my face
<Alma> CrystalPhoenix: Why would I even attempt to try to convince someone?
<DeerioJim> this has been a fun day
*DoctoDoctorWho sits in the back of chat and eats popcorn
<Alma> This is the internet. Just agree and good is
<Kujo_Jojo> DoctoDoctorWho evening*
<Caramel_Colours> General Question: Do you think the world would be a better place if the MLP:FIM Ponies were real?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> idk why but the whole episode had a Rayman Origins vibe to me :D
<silence2> be back got to end loop
<CrystalPhoenix> Alma, only time you do that is when a debate goes in circle
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://poni.tylian.net/_images/f01dad8915d4d53142f8eb259e1ecbaa/327%20-%20discord%20gif%20popcorn.gif
<TyroTheFox> Probably!
<AlexSparkle> Weatherhoof has to drink it all xD
<Latiken> XP
<Alma> CrystalPhoenix: Which it did
<Tomekke> Is the stream at another place now?
*Kujo_Jojo noms cinema sweets from Skyfall
<Swagestia> ok back
<Latiken> Discorbleh. Lol.
<CrystalPhoenix> Alma, you haven't put any arguments on your claim
<patec> refresh it
<Tomtortoise> its at http://events.yoursiblings.org/
<DeerioJim> can you not see it?
<alexxm> damn that was actually a pretty good drawing
<Tomtortoise> try refreshing the page
<CrystalPhoenix> That's not a debate
<patec> we changed a few things because of technicalm difficulties. just refresh the page if you can't see the streams
<Alma> CrystalPhoenix: Only adult fans who are aware of the Bronie community and have a sort of meta-understanding of the series get these kind of jokes
<Tomtortoise> Working now?
<Tomekke> will we still see the stream of sui?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Updates are COOL
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man i hadnt laugh so hard in my life until this episode :D
<MadSurge> I'm tired already, gotta go to bed :(
<Swagestia> swag
<Weatherhoof> >Alex: I prepare the mulled wine for it
<MadSurge> Goodnight guys
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> night MadSurge
<alexxm> bey MadSurge
<AlexSparkle> :D
<Latiken> Sui soesn't seem to stream anymore. Oo
<BlaxBlain> The wiiupdates
<Yavos> @Tomekke Sui is having problems with livestream
<Latiken> *doesn't
<Jelonheoh> updates is best game
<DoctoDoctorWho> Alma: Hey, whats that? It looks like the point of putting those jokes into the show.
<thelonepony> Bye Mad-damn it
<CrystalPhoenix> Alma, so that's it only one gag ruined the episode?
<silence> good night madsurge
<Tomekke> I'll tell her that Lati
<Swagestia> swag swag swag swag
<Latiken> ?

<AlexSparkle> There is so much time between the last chorus to dance
<Yavos> livestream crashes for her, so she can't stream
<DoctoDoctorWho> swig
<AlexSparkle> nice one perry xD
<Bronysith> Swagestia: die
<Tomtortoise> W00t!
*Yavos applauds
<Alma> CrystalPhoenix: To me it seemed like they concentrated a bit too much on that, but that is just my neglectible opinion
<MLP_Brovakiin> Faglestia :>
<AlexSparkle> and now you made weatherhoof drunk :3
<Roach> This might stand somewhere but anyway:When is Galacon?
<Latiken> Well, she still has 45 min.
<Dolkar> Alma: That's exactly the reason I liked this episode - they are trying to appeal older fans... I can't see anything bad about that...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Last warning Swagestia, stop spamming 'swag'.
<Weatherhoof> Aug. 3rd + 4th
<Tomtortoise> I may die from how much I just drank
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> same here Dolkar :)

<Kujo_Jojo> Dolkar has a point
<Tomtortoise> they will be switching
<Swagestia> i'm not spamming swag
<silence> I agree
<CrystalPhoenix> Alma I can't agree with you on that, the episode was pretty solid and there was quite a lot of content to discuss about
<CrystalPhoenix> not only one gag
<Tomtortoise> 5 Euro Donation!
<Alma> And am I the only one who thought these ponie drawings Pinkie Pie did kind of looked like in style of that guy who did the shed.mov?

<cachi01|Blackcops2Za> i posted a PM without the other guy permission

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Bronysith: :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> Soldiers of the union, broke the citadel! Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell!~ last one I promise.
<thelonepony> Bronysith: :D
<Everlasting_Joy> alexxm: :D
<alexxm> Everlasting_Joy PETA
<Invi> Everlasting_Joy, why would one poop because you called it?
<Meanwhile> Also, hi everybody.
<J_E_Smith71> So is this a race or a mission?
<Everlasting_Joy> Invi: I love you guys.
<Kandarihu> If you get to play as Aiai, I hope Meemee is playable to.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What is Sega's obession with Seaside Hill?
<DeerioJim> Twist is best CmC
<Yavos> yeah... even if we forward them they don't always get answered :/
<Everlasting_Joy> :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its in every fucking racing game
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Meh, alright :P
<Everlasting_Joy> SuperBrony64: 2nd > 3rd.
<AlexSparkle> Applejack is best background pony
<LunasGuard> damn u tails
<Caramel_Colours> That's ok, just making sure they are at least getting logged.
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: hes just a kid
<muffinexplosion> twist isn't even best plot twist
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeMagnes[R]: IKR?
<DeerioJim> MLP Napkins
<Tomtortoise> Pink Celestia
<TheNoPony> Derpy is best wizard
<Kandarihu> What? I thought the target was 1st
<AlexSparkle> most hilarious merchandise? That fail vector of Twilight Sparkle
<twilight_sprinkle> why is she standing like that, does she have a cramo
<Invi> so, stickers are like achievements?
<twilight_sprinkle> *cramp
<DeerioJim> ^
<Invi> or do they actually do sth?
<muffinexplosion> foreshadowing!
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, she's a fanservice girl.
<Zebranky> Those backpacks are AWESOME
<MMC> Lyra plushie
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: that i can tell :D
<Zebranky> Oh man, the Twilight singing plushie
<Zebranky> I have that
<Roach> 2 More donations..
<twilight_sprinkle> female heroes are always fanservice..
<Venusy> Oh yeah, those Rainbow Dash pyjamas are creepy
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353268042881.jpg have some daw
<Nirual> thats not even close to official MMC
<Zebranky> And how has no one mentioned Pinklestia?
<DeerioJim> I saw some custom MLP diapers some days ago
<Vivex> She's got a steel knee from Vietnam, she can't bend her right leg
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, but that's why she's standing the way she does. She's EXPLICITLY fanservice.
<Venusy> Especially as the WLF pic has them being modeled by a ghost
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> dawww
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You allready have a WiiU god damn
<J_E_Smith71> Are you looking to race friends, SB?
<DoctoDoctorWho> I want a tank so bad
<twilight_sprinkle> heh ok Kandarihu
<TheNoPony> Fun Fact: Celestia is actually pink. The pinklestia toy is making PC alot more darker.
<Meanwhile> So is everyone watching stream on a different site or is there something I can faff around with in the tools setting of this thing?
<Zebranky> http://www.amazon.com/My-Little-Pony-Princess-Celestia/dp/B0043WAPJM
<Kandarihu> And that's not true of all female game characters
<Tomtortoise> XD
<J_E_Smith71> Meanwhile: http://www.twitch.tv/superbrony64?utm_campaign=live_embed_click&utm_source=www-cdn.jtvnw.net
<pony_429860_> Question: Why so serious?
<BlaxBlain> Yeah it's on twitch
<SuperBrony64> 11,02J_E_Smith71: Don't be silly...that would mean I have friends...
<Zebranky> I know she's pink!
<Tomtortoise> Taxidermy is a respectable job
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: not all, but like 98%
<Meanwhile> Fucking, why?
<Zebranky> Yeah, much like Rarity is actually a very light purple/blue
<Venus> 08,01SuperBrony64: my god, the very thought...
<Tomtortoise> 100 Euro Donation!
<Tomtortoise> !!!!!1
<Carrot_Top> Woaaaahhh

<AlexSparkle> the 50th donator donated 100 euro
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SuperBrony64: *takes off shades*My GOD...:D
<J_E_Smith71> Meanwhile: Or try pushinh play on the embed here
<Zebranky> I ripped open one of those Celestia toys and started reverse-engineering the board
<Carrot_Top> really??? omg
<DeerioJim> someone really wants to hear you sing
<EightTrack> Hey guys
<Zebranky> http://www.mercuric.net/tmp/goodtimes.jpg
<weeping_pegasi82> moo
<EightTrack> Told ya I was in for a henge ;)
<Nirual> I like how the celestia toybox has a "try me" sign that points to her rear
<Zebranky> Hey, EightTrack! :D
<Meanwhile> The embed just says no.
<AlexSparkle> some bronies just want to watch the artist sing
<DeerioJim> @zebranky thats kinda cool
<Meanwhile> I kind of feel that defeats the point of having an embed.
<BlaxBlain> Alright well i'm going to do internet things.
<Tomtortoise> Thanks EightTrack!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02HAI LOADING CIRCLE
<BlaxBlain> Goodbye

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 sorry not risking it i'm not watching that thing
<TyroTheFox> Someone asking about playing Magicka in here?
<DerpyMuffins> SuperBrony64 friend code?
<Deacon> alexxm i've been good, yourself?
<J_E_Smith71> Meanwhile: Is SB playing WiiU
<Yavos> @pony_429860 [23:37:40] Tyro: Yes. I've played Magicka. It's interesting. A sort of top down shooter crossed with Doodle God.
<Latiken> Minutes aren't seconds, silly.
<Zebranky> Turns out, toy engineers are pretty impressive. They really know how to do things super-cheap.
<Phase4> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, Trust me, watch it
<DeerioJim> I havent heard it
<Meanwhile> Definitely not then.
<Phase4> its not the movie, its a review :P
<J_E_Smith71> SuperBrony64: You doing more Sonic or was that it?
<alexxm> i'm good Deacon
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i mean the movie
<Zebranky> Ooh, I should listen to that
<Phase4> feel free to ignore the movie
<Meanwhile> Should've told me that sooner, would've saved me the two minutes I spent pressing buttons.
<Zebranky> I'm still a fan of "Set Fire to the Con"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i did watch the review
<Kandarihu> Did he do ZombiU yet?
<J_E_Smith71> Meanwhile: He was playing Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed
<DoctoDoctorWho> SuperBrony64: Sketch_Toku_Brony http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassesPull
<Latiken> Jeff Burgess?
<J_E_Smith71> Meanwhile: He's playing through every game for it he has in small chunks
<Meanwhile> Sonic really needs to stay in his grave.
<Bronysith> meanwhile in a nutshell http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353266512970.gif minus the moustache
<Zebranky> Yep

<DoctoDoctorWho> Sketch_Toku_Brony: SuperBrony64 this one I ment http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Dramaticremovalcropped_5788.jpg
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> DoctoDoctorWho: :D very informative
<Kandarihu> ROFL, SuperBrony64
<Jelonheoh> seroiusly. how much money has he spent on the wii u so far
<CriticKitten> So you're streaming now, SB? Admit I haven't been paying attention, was trapped in a neverending GW2 event. XD
<AlexSparkle> I'd actually like to
<Deacon> so...nintendo finally utelizes online, how is it?
<Tomtortoise> Wax on, Wax off
<Meanwhile> Was it the Risen CriticKitten?
<CriticKitten> Worse.
<CriticKitten> The karka.
<Everlasting_Joy> DoctoDoctorWho: http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/mother-of-god-meme.jpg
<Bakpony> i did my part already^^
<Meanwhile> Rave.
<AlexSparkle> I'd like to sing too D:
<CriticKitten> The big finale event just finished. Got several exotics and unique items from the chest. :3
<Meanwhile> Anything useful, or all salvage?
<Tomtortoise> 30 Euro Donation!
<DoctoDoctorWho> Everlasting_Joy: yes, all teh win
<CriticKitten> I got....2 rares which I TP'd for ~50 silver, 2 exotics (and a third which dropped during the event), and 2 unique exotic items that probably won't be available in any other way (one of which was an accessory, the other a 20-slot bag)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Miiverse is best game :3
<Ikasu_Kaitou> You should totally call them "bronations"
<Tomtortoise> XD
<Meanwhile> 20 slots. Nice.
<Everlasting_Joy> These drawings :D.
<CriticKitten> Total value of the lot is probably around....6-7 gold or so
<Bakpony> and now the success one
*AlexSparkle applauds
<DeerioJim> *claps*
<twilight_sprinkle> black ops 2 costs 60 bucks??...
<Meanwhile> S'pretty good actually.
<Deacon> this is miiverse?
<CriticKitten> Not including the unique items, of course, which are account bound.
<Yavos> forgot to change the value the first time, so I had to do it again xD
<Yooy> Amazing
<Everlasting_Joy> That Rageguy is hte best one.
<CriticKitten> It is.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<CriticKitten> Way better than usual events. I wonder if maybe they're learning.
<BlazingDawn> Woohoo
<TheNoPony> I have the slender download in my askbox...
<BlazingDawn> You rock
<TheNoPony> I'm scared.
<Carrot_Top> Wooooooo
<Meanwhile> Maybe. I got bored and stopped playing shortly after I got max level.
<Kandarihu> I wonder what kind of replies SB64's post is gonna get.
<alexxm> whats he drawing
<pony_429860> Request: Matrix crossover - Twilight as Neo and many Pinkie pies as Agent Smith!
<Carrot_Top> Yeaaah sinigiiing
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: the one about shooting people?:P
<CriticKitten> By the time you hit max level, you've usually got your money's worth anyways, with the lack of subscription
<Jelonheoh> screw typing. DRAW IT!
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, yeah
<MovieTrash_> 15 minuites left
<Nirual> I wonder how a charity lifestream of just singing would go.
<CriticKitten> I'm pretty satisfied with the event, all told. The new dungeon kicks ass, too.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: ye lol that should be interesting
<Yavos> @pony_429860 it's already in the list ;)
<Meanwhile> Indeed. Though tbh, if I had the same experience when I was playing WoW, I would've stopped before I'd needed to actually buy a subscription.
<TheNoPony> Guys
<donutpop365> Augh, I missed Saturday/Release Time again!
<AlexSparkle> @Nirual i'd totally go with this one

<Everlasting_Joy> All I can see with these images is the fatson dad saying "bring it on!"
<donutpop365> Should have used a shortener...
<BlazingDawn> Question - If you were trapped with the other artists in this stream, in an elevator, for 3 days... What do?
<twilight_sprinkle> donutpop365: nah thats an ok link size

<Deacon> hmm, I'm seeing some unbans
<RoboGerbil> SaxyPretender is going all out

<twilight_sprinkle> weeping_pegasi82: that game has an evil ending
<fluttercry> 05,15So guys....how bout dat Wii U?
<weeping_pegasi82> twilight_sprinkle: I know :$
<twilight_sprinkle> idk, i dont play consoles
<fluttercry> 05,15chat is ded
<thelonepony> pretty good from SB's perspective
<FlutterMEDIC> still waiting for Assassin's Creed 3 :(
<Deacon> don't knwo what to think about the WiiU, also ello fluttercry
<FlutterMEDIC> and yes, i know it came out for CONSOLES on October 30
<Kandarihu> Hmm, I just did something amazingly stupid.
<Kandarihu> I refreshed the stream while it was working earlier
<twilight_sprinkle> stream is over Kandarihu
<CriticKitten> Haven't seen anything for the Wii U
<CriticKitten> So can't say
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, I know, but it's 404ing me now
<Bakpony> gotta so
<Bakpony> *go
<Bakpony> bye^^
<Meanwhile> It's the Wii U so I'm obligated to hate it on principle.
<CriticKitten> Oh then here
<CriticKitten> Lemme give you some reasons to hate the new XBox instead
<thelonepony> New Xbox?
<GeeBlitz> WiiU
<Meanwhile> The target demographic.
<FlutterMEDIC> inb4 shitstorm
<GeeBlitz> OP
<Meanwhile> That's all I need.
<CriticKitten> But I have better
<CriticKitten> "According to the mag's final 'exposé', the next-gen Xbox - which it speculates is likely to be called simply "Xbox" - will introduce Kinect 2.0, use Blu-ray discs and feature directional audio, a TV output AND input, 'innovative controller' and - at a later stage of the console's life - AR glasses."
<thelonepony> ........
<Meanwhile> You're right.
<Meanwhile> I hate it more now.
<CriticKitten> Told ya :D
<Diagon197> meh
<FlutterMEDIC> and nothing new was added
<Kandarihu> Gee, hating for the sake of hating? That's too much hate.
<Buytoast> "With the new Kinect 2.0, you are now able to simulate a situation in which you simulate having a fun, enjoyable gaming experience."
<Meanwhile> Glorious PC gaming master race aside, consoles have been pretty depressing the last few generations.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: but its totally cool and the chicks dig it
<FlutterMEDIC> i think it stopped with the discontinuing of the Gamecube
<Buytoast> "Please note that the kinect 2.0 will not promise you any fun and, if you are looking for fun, the Kinect 2.0 may not be the simulator simulator for you."
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, what? Hate?
<Meanwhile> "Please note that purchasing the kinect 2.0 guarantees you a place in hell."
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: yeah but im being sarcastic
<CriticKitten> Purchasing the Kinect 2.0? Oh no, silly.
<CriticKitten> Odds are good it'll be bundled with the console.
<Kandarihu> Well the Kinect is good for homebrew mo-cap, though.
<Buytoast> "If you have any complaints, please put them in the box marked 'Incinerator', next to the 'Ancient Evil Awakening Tacitcs' box."
<CriticKitten> If not incorporated into it directly.
<CrystalPhoenix> simply named xbox?
<CrystalPhoenix> also having Blu-ray?
<CriticKitten> So not only will you HAVE to buy it to get the new XBox, likely you won't even be able to USE it. :P
<Safari|phone> Hello Professor
<Meanwhile> "Please note that spending too much time in the presence of the Kinect 2.0 can provoke tears in the fabric of reality and invite possession by the old ones who ruled the stars when mankind was young."
<CriticKitten> Without Kinect.
<Professor> hello
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: see because if you hate everything it means youre above it and smarter than the rest
<CrystalPhoenix> Sony won the battle before even starting
<Buytoast> AHAHA
<Buytoast> Sony
<Deacon> twilight_sprinkle but wouldn't that make you more alone?
<CrystalPhoenix> Buytoast, Sony in general
<AttackWithHugs> Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<Professor> is there a video bieng steamed on your guys computer?
<CrystalPhoenix> not the gaming department
<FlutterMEDIC> Professor: nope
<Safari|phone> How are you, Professor
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, no it doesn't. It just means you're just a bitter fellow who's going to have an abnormally short lifespan from having a poor outlook on life.
<Meanwhile> I can forgive Sony because of the PS2. I liked the PS2.
<Professor> i am good you?
<twilight_sprinkle> Deacon: no because some people believe the same, that hating things make you smarter and above it, so theyll follow
<Safari|phone> Good thanks. :)
<Kandarihu> And that you're likely to drag other people down with you to an early grave.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: again, im beng sarcastic, and explaining why some do it
<AttackWithHugs> No stream?
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: I consider that my duty to the universe.
<Professor> can't wait for trixi episode:|
<FlutterMEDIC> i mostly forgive Sony for the first couple of Crash Bandicoot games. games were awesome
<CriticKitten> But yeah. I can't wait until E3. :3
<CriticKitten> If Microsoft unveils a system like THAT, woo boy
<CriticKitten> It'll be hilarious
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: it also provides an easy outlook on life, where you can be lazy and just say its not worth actually doing anything
<Buytoast> every party needs a pooper
<Buytoast> that's why they invited Kandarihu
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<donutpop365> I have to go everypony, ciao ^.^
<thelonepony> Bye donutpop365
<Professor> lol tfs phrase love it
<CriticKitten> Oh, best part though has GOT to be this part, which is meant to IMPRESS YOU with how amazing this console's tech is.
<CriticKitten> "Current codename 'Durango' dev kits boast a CPU with "four hardware cores, each divided into four logical cores" and an impressive 8GB of RAM, XBW reports."
<AttackWithHugs> Bye donutpop365
<Meanwhile> Kind of like how twilight_sprinkle was invited to fulfill the parties quota of being a bellend.
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, I hate that mentality. The self-proclaimed "equal opportunity haters" claim to be morally superior to bigots and racists, but they're just nothing but hate mongers
<GilDash> Meanwhile: You're doing that all by yourself. :p
<CriticKitten> WOW! You mean your brand new console has specs roughly equal to 3-year old gaming PCs? NICE
<Professor> lol
<Meanwhile> GilDash come on now, you're meant to be in my corner. Get your head in the game.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I actually don't know what it is you're fighting for. XD
<CriticKitten> Hell, MY rig can match the alleged specs of the new XBox if those are true. XD
<Buytoast> i hate everything
<Meanwhile> GilDash: My right to hate things I hate.
<Buytoast> does that make me a bad person Kandarihu?
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu hates you for hating everything.
<Buytoast> well darn
<Buytoast> i guess i'd better repent
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, you don't have to hate everything. Try appreciating stuff for once. What do you like?
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Whilst I might not like it, you do have a right to hate things pointlessly. Or with points. Just avoid prejudice and we're all good.
<Meanwhile> Splendid.
<Cipher> 0,14I detect KVETCHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING
<CriticKitten> GilDash: Meanwhile is the hater this chat deserves.
<Buytoast> why apprecaite anything when nothing else will go right?
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<Meanwhile> And Buytoast is the hater it needs right now.
<Buytoast> Everything is terrible.
<Meanwhile> I forget which one is meant to be Batman, but basically chat is Gotham City.
<Ryunosuke> Cipher: this isnt whining.... :)
<twilight_sprinkle1> goddamn random disconnects

<AJIsAwesome> Nu, us stahp right naow MaconBane.
<Shizuka> 13we can't answer that yet because dark matter is screwing all the calculations up
<Kurra> Yaaaay, we can't worry about the universe expanding infinitely until there is just about nothing infinitely dispersed everywhere!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Star_Gazer, we shall 5 Guys one day if we ever meet up. We shall do that and burn our hands trying to get the burger out the forest of fresh fries

<AssaultWithEmbraces> Someone ping me
<Shizuka> 13dark matter is pretty much the end of the "what will happen to the universe" question, if there's not enough, we expand forever and lose all energy billions of years down the line
<Jmo> AssaultWithEmbraces,
<Star_Gazer> AssaultWithEmbraces: yes?
<Shizuka> 13if there's enough then eventually things slow down and smash back together

<SaxyPretender> 0,14the loss of energy is a scary thought
<Meanwhile> You'll be dead before then.
<Canada_Brony> weeping_pegasi82 :???
<something> wtf is this
<Shizuka> 13if you think about it, if we determine there's enough dark matter for a big crunch, then we also have a probable cause of the big bang
<CrazyMutteringguy> SaxyPretender so we see the emergence of Galactus?
<twilight_sprinkle> SaxyPretender: why would there be an energy loss
<Shizuka> 13all that stuff getting crunched together has to go somewhere
<Kurra> Shizuka, I hope everything collapses back down, it'd be really sad if everything and everyone got so dispersed that everything everywhere would be isolated for such a long time.
<something> D:
<BaconMane> 0,5But jmooooo
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: all the energy gets expended as things are further apart

<Kurra> Lucky Charms :D
<weeping_pegasi82> sorry I'll speak proper english from now on
<twilight_sprinkle> proper english is boring
<Kurra> actually it's funny, compare the amount of sugars in Lucky Charms to most any other cereal, and the differences aren't that large.

<twilight_sprinkle> that or hes just a pt smoker like tehlonpon
<Kurra> twilight_sprinkle: I sort of hold Lucky Charms as sacred. It's my tie to childhood and youth, and I always imagine that all the sugar acts as a food of youth, and smiles. :) Which honestly, I need the placebo effect at least, as I get older and older. :(
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Kurra: ah, childhood eh :P

<Jageman> twilight_sprinkle: true, but she seems like a jack of all trades, master of none to mee.
<Zacklego> wow rodger pain
<CrazyMutteringguy> Spoilers: For the whales... human hertz hurts

<Buytoast> Truly a terrifying group of whale thugs.
<Canadian_Brony> I'm so glad Orcas aren't really whales
<Zacklego> Watching this made me find a buck to give about whales
<Zacklego> A while ago, a woman died by a whale in seaworld

<Zacklego> the news reported "Killer whale kills woman"
<Ryunosuke> sounds like a peta plug to me ><
<Jageman> RawketLawnchair: ?
<CCCP> what about unnatural selection?
<Ponybean> the humans just want to talk to the whales
<Buytoast> Mr. Sagan, while whales may be dying, we must never forget Ishmael and the late Captain Ahab."

<Shizuka> 135 BILLION BITS
<Ryunosuke> All the bits!
<Canadian_Brony> my cells are freakin' rich
<twilight_sprinkle> 5 BILLION MONEY
<Jageman> Blah Blah Blah, life is complex and amazing. We get it.
<Shizuka> 135 five gigabits, divided by 8 is less than a gigabyte
<Shizuka> 13that's a little over half a gig
<Shizuka> 13asuka here stores 3.5 terabytes, SO WHY DON'T I HAVE A BUNCH OF HUMENS ON MY HARD DRIVE
<twilight_sprinkle> i do
<IsAJAwesome> Shizuka: 3.5 TERABYTES? :O
<Shizuka> 131.5TB internal, 2 external
<Jageman> Shizuka: each "bit" is acually 1 in 4 while a computer bit is 1 in 2
<Ryunosuke> Shizuka: wait till it becomes self aware :)
<Punkie_Pue> Nice
<twilight_sprinkle> i torrented myself some asian guys to do my math homework
<IsAJAwesome> Shizuka: Wow... :O
<Jelonheoh> thats nothing. we have a computer with a 5 terabyte hardrive
*Kurra does a little research, and discovers the Bonus Army D:
<Shizuka> 13Jageman: he's referring to a bit as a binary decision
<Shizuka> 13one dna rung is two bits
<Mutterguy> yeah except there some recent reasearch that theres a whole bunch of code processing built into the code as well
<Ponybean> o n o..science!
<Jageman> Shizuka: i know, but our dna is not binary
<Canadian_Brony> 1 terabyte=1024 gigabytes
<Kurra> :<
<Shizuka> 13yes but a bit of information is a bit of information
<Shizuka> 13dna takes two bits to describe one rung, four possibilities
<Afflict[phone]> hey
<Mutterguy> although isn't dna Quarternary?
<scout19_tf2> ugh more science
<Shizuka> 13there are four bases that arrange in pairs
<Shizuka> 13but again, to describe one base, which has four possible states, you need two bits
<Shizuka> 13if one bit represents 1 or 0
<Jageman> Shizuka: yes which would be a base 4
<Shizuka> 13^
<Shizuka> 13but again the way he's referred to bits in the series he means binary
<Shizuka> 13state on or state off
<Jageman> Shizuka: so he is simplifying it?
<Shizuka> 13eeyup
<Ryunosuke> r... wha?
<Shizuka> 13it's cosmos, it was designed to popularize science
<Shizuka> 13though the statistic i've heard is humans use 10 billion rungs of dna, which would take much more than 5 billion bits to represent, base 2 or 4
<Ponybean> is he in our brain?
<Shizuka> 13where did i leeeeve my keeees
<Shizuka> 13on top of the buk duh
<Ponybean> i left them in a box

<Shizuka> 13this specifically? they were filming cosmos when you were a kid carl?
<Canadian_Brony> I remember hearing something that said the brain can be put into 3 parts: new, middle, and old brain. Newer the brain, more complex it is.
*AssaultWithEmbraces throws a bag of marshmallows at Jmo's head

<Ryunosuke> what?
<Shizuka> 13only 3 billion?
<Shizuka> 13in that case he's not even right about the 5 billion bit mark
<Shizuka> 13would take 12 billion bits to describe that
<Ryunosuke> isnt that the whole purpose of nation building is to build groups and hierarchy?
<Ryunosuke> :)
<Ryunosuke> just saying
<Buytoast> HA
<Buytoast> i knew i was Godzilla

<CrystalPhoenix> Punkie_Pue, wat
<AJIsAwesome> CrystalPhoenix: Mistab.
<Jageman> the internet was estimated at 5 billion gigabytes of data in 2008-ish
<CrystalPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, I figured
<CyberTheDjPony> im not im just saying i thoght this was a pony site :/
<Punkie_Pue> CrystalPhoenix: Wrong person

<Jelonheoh> um. then in china *Skip* wooden blocks. dafaq
<Buytoast> there is no letter P
<CyberTheDjPony> well brony but what every lol
<Jelonheoh> its magic...you know
<twilight_sprinkle> CyberTheDjPony: ponies are rarely streamed
<Dark_Horst> CyberTheDjPony: then they'd call it ponystate. as it is, it'S bronystate. we watcha bout everything here. also friday movie nights and the new episodes. those are the only scheduled times that have pony
<CyberTheDjPony> I thought so aah
<twilight_sprinkle> saying its bronystate not ponystate doesnt really explain anything
<Dark_Horst> otherwise, it's what the streamers feel like showing
<Jelonheoh> bronystate: steaming as frequently as humanly possible
<Jelonheoh> thats why i check here so often
<Canadian_Brony> how does BronyState "steam"?
<Jelonheoh> oh shi.
<twilight_sprinkle> its a train, duh
<Jageman> i am not aware of any site that streams ponies 24/7

<CyberTheDjPony> omg old computers :o
<soulrider95> WOAH
<twilight_sprinkle> aw man dat laptop, i want one
<Canadian_Brony> >global intelligence
<Shizuka> 13cosmos was sort of remastered in 1992 or so which is what this copy is from
<PonyBean> internet be kicking me D:
<Canadian_Brony> >implying internet
<Shizuka> 13so some clip segments are probably enhanced from the original
<Shizuka> 13we had basic touch and netscape in 92
<Panda> So... this is a big outdated? Shizuka?
<Shizuka> 13the original is from 80
<Punkie_Pue> Resistive touch screen im guessing
<Dark_Horst> 32 years
<Jageman> I think Sagen would have flipped if shown an iPad
<Dark_Horst> fuck, that'S a long time in science
<CrazyHippie> Hey guys!
<CyberTheDjPony> sup
<CrazyHippie> Gas Prices
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, CrazyHippie. :)
<Canadian_Brony> hi CrazyHippie
<CrazyHippie> Hi AJIsAwesome and Canadian_Brony
<CyberTheDjPony> haha i see what you did there
<Shizuka> 13it's not all great though, like i said earlier we still haven't worked out how much dark matter there is and whether the universe will expand forever or eventually collapse
<CrazyHippie> :P
<twilight_sprinkle> oh theres plenty of work left to be done
<twilight_sprinkle> hi CrazyHippie btw
<CrazyHippie> Shizuka: Imagine feeling the Universe collapse
<Jageman> Shizuka: We don't even know what dark matter is. We only have guesses.
<CrazyHippie> And ello twilight_sprinkle
<Shizuka> 13i want to be there billions of years from now when the crunch starts, some new life evolves and begins science
<Shizuka> 13and when they look up and see all the galaxies screaming towards them
<Shizuka> 13we have it easy, the galaxies are running away :3
<CrazyHippie> Sounds painful
<Canadian_Brony> seems legit
<Panda> and in the future, Shizuka will be their overlord.
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: life might be impossible at that point
<Jageman> Shizuka: and i think it was solved that the universe will accelerate out of control and have a big rip in about 17 billion years
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: the great epiphany of that time: "...oh fuck"
<Canadian_Brony> xD
<Shizuka> 13mm last i read up the dark matter question is still up in the air, especially in light of the higgs
<Shizuka> 13there could still be enough matter to close the universe
<CyberTheDjPony> why is shizukas text pink?
<Dark_Horst> becasue moderator
<Meanwhile> Because purple was taken?
<Punkie_Pue> hes a mod
<Panda> CyberTheDjPony, because... ponies.
<Canadian_Brony> CyberTheDjPony she's a mod and mods are allowed to have colourful text.
<AJIsAwesome> Mod color.
<Panda> Punkie_Pue: she*
<J_E_Smith71> CyberTheDjPony: Mods have color
<Dark_Horst> Punkie_Pue: *she
<CyberTheDjPony> ooh
<Punkie_Pue> Sorry
<Punkie_Pue> She is a mod
<CrazyHippie> Because he donated 10000 dollars to bronystate CyberTheDjPony
<Panda> uh... dat nipple?
<AJIsAwesome> CrazyHippie: *She :)
<Kurra> Do we know yet if the Higgs particle has mass?
<CrazyHippie> she******
<Jageman> Shizuka: I guess dark matter could be the variable that throughs all our predictions about the future off.
<Shizuka> 13it causes mass
<Punkie_Pue> I had no idea. Im sorry.
<CrazyHippie> ^
<CyberTheDjPony> ._. k then
<Canadian_Brony> s'alright
<Shizuka> 13higgs is the force carrier for mass, like photons for electromagnetism and gluons for strong force
<Shizuka> 13that i know of
<Jezebel> anyone want to rp with me?
<Kurra> Oh okay :)
<CyberTheDjPony> i would
<Panda> Jezebel... no
<CyberTheDjPony> i guess
<Jmo> inb4 people jump.

<Shizuka> 13this sounds like it belongs in an enigma track
<Canadian_Brony> PonyBean roleplay
<Panda> xD
<PonyBean> i knew that..>o>
<CrazyHippie> :P
<Kurra> It is so weird, that there is a particle that CAUSES mass, as if it were a flag that has to be turned on for things to have susbstance XD
<CyberTheDjPony> lol
<Canadian_Brony> it kinda does . . . what the hell?
<Jageman> So far, a big crunch has been ruled out by observations, but we have not been observing for long.
<Panda> So whats next Shizuka? ^^
<Shizuka> 13aaaaaaand break into the shakuhachi and o fortuna chanting...
<Ryunosuke> and then Beast Wars happened and almost mucked everything up :)
<CrazyHippie> SCIENCE! Right?
<Jageman> Kurra: accually, its the particle you need to not be moving the speed of light.
<Canadian_Brony> CrazyHippie *turn* of COURSE!!

<Celestia> Jageman, we are
<Kurra> Whoa, really high quality stream!
<CrystalPhoenix> Vordox, what's wrong?
<AJIsAwesome> Cool it with the spam, CyberTheDjPony.
<Deacon> Vordox because FUN!
<GamerLuna> Jageman, who? us?
<Vordox> CrystalPhoenix: Pinkies everywhere...
<Stallion_of_War> For some reason this song reminds me of The Force Unleashed II where you grapple your enemy by stabbing him with one of your lightsabers and then flip-throwing him.
<Vordox> Celestia: Greetings then, Princess.
<Derpy_Dash> me: http://billybobfm.webs.com/Devbest/Bbs_P3.png
<CrystalPhoenix> well it was this week's episode
<Celestia> Hello, Vordox.
<AJIsAwesome> All the FUN. :D
<Vordox> Celestia: Should you really have time over, I thought being a princess took most of your awake time doing your chores.
<CyberTheDjPony> ALEX!!!
<Derpy_Hooves> floof \:3/
<Celestia> I don't have chores. Just protect.
<CyberTheDjPony> FAHK YEAH *smashes head on keyboard*
<AJIsAwesome> "I'll have to give myself a PRRRROMOTION!"
<Jageman> Celestia: Do you even sleep? Also, how big is the sun in Equestria?
<GamerLuna> CyberThDjPony, why must you be random?
<Celestia> And rule
<Celestia> Luna, too
<Stallion_of_War> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/11/17/Jw_uEiVZK0SVJ4GJKrGvDw2.png
<Vordox> Celestia: Don't forget the sun.
<Celestia> Oh, yes
<Derpy_Hooves> im giving my self a promotion as well, floof, all the floof, is mine
<Derpy_Dash> http://billybobfm.webs.com/Devbest/Bbs_P3.png
<Deacon> Stallion_of_War huh, forgot about that episode of foster's
<GamerLuna> We sleep, It's just that I'm nocturnal and sis sleeps when I guard
<CrystalPhoenix> Stallion_of_War, the clone trope has been done a lot of time in other cartoons
<AttackWithHugs> Oh my god
<CrystalPhoenix> it's not that surprising
<Kurra> fun!\
<AttackWithHugs> Refresh the stream and the whole thing starts all over
<CrystalPhoenix> and we need to watch Foster's home for imaginary friends
<Derpy_Hooves> fun?
<CrystalPhoenix> AttackWithHugs, wait......we have THE FLASH EMBED?
<CrystalPhoenix> Ok I'm with Vordox
<CrystalPhoenix> Mod WHY
<AttackWithHugs> CrystalPhoenix, apparently so
<AttackWithHugs> I JUST refreshed and it restarted.
<Jageman> Celestia: How big is your sun? Also, why don't the sun and moon appear in the sky at the same time?
<Jageman> Those questions are for Luna too.
<Derpy_Hooves> kirz \:3/
<kirz> ?
<Derpy_Hooves> hai
<kirz> giant pingout I take it?
<AttackWithHugs> Does it loop?
<Jageman> Hello?
<Deacon> bonjour!
<GamerLuna> yes? Jageman?
<kirz|rawr> yep
<AttackWithHugs> Sup?
<AttackWithHugs> Aaah
<kirz|rawr> lol
<Jageman> GamerLuna: How big is your sun? Also, why don't the sun and moon appear in the sky at the same time?
<kirz|rawr> what, you thought there was an end?
<AttackWithHugs> Admittedly, yes.
<Meanwhile> It never ends.
<Meanwhile> I don't know what it is
<Meanwhile> But it never ends.
<AttackWithHugs> Then I hit the magical Refresh button and...
<AJIsAwesome> So, how about that airline food?
<AttackWithHugs> I'm surprised the stream hasn't crashed because Pinkie
<lUNA> hELLO
<Deacon> lali-ho lUNA
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome f*cking disgusting.
<AttackWithHugs> I know if you have ONE Pinkie on Desktop Ponies and go to play a game, she multiplise like mad and lags your computer to hell
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: I know, right?
<Canadian_Brony> Even pizza is bad.
<Deacon> is it that bad? never flown myself?
<Canadian_Brony> How do you f*ck up pizza?
<CrimsonPhoenix> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<Jageman> Why does the stream have pinkie pies in it?
<AJIsAwesome> CrystalPhoenix: WUT
<kirz> why not?
<CrystalPhoenix> Magic
<Vordox> Celestia: ... You haven't forgotten the sun, have you...?
<Celestia> I'm so old I forgot! :3
<Celestia> No, I lowered it. The moon is high, right, Luna?
<willycole> FUN
<Derpy_Dash> pinkie pie is my b****
<Derpy_Dash> :O
<Celestia> :o
<Derpy_Dash> :$

<Celestia> How did you do that, Derpy_Dash/
<Derpy_Dash> no stream?

<Rose`|gammingmood> whats this?
<Shizuka> 13hello netsplit
<Deacon> oh hai netsplit, hwo I missed you
<AJIsAwesome> Deacon: Most of it is. It's been very rare that I have had "okay" food.
<GamerLuna> I don't control the sun, just the moon, but I think it's half the size of the sun, and I dont know about the reason they dont appear at the same time, my sis is the older one, she should, I think
<Canadian_Brony> WOAH
<pony_234949> lightIRC's derping the crap out for me
<flutter_spin> yes, there is stream
<Princess> Hello
<Canadian_Brony> Chat exploded
<Kurra> AAAAAAA
<pony_234949> ...
<Vordox> Shizuka: So...is this stream online or offline?
<flutter_spin> it should be live
<Princess> I am Celestia :)
<Jageman> my chat is glitching brb
<GamerLuna> Hi there Celly
<Stallion_of_War> Test?
<Stallion_of_War> Better
<Princess> Hello Luna
<Vordox> Oh, my. This is kinda insane... I think we split the universes again.
<Derpy_Hooves> flutter_spin: no it's not live, it's just an embeded video loop
<Jageman> back
<Rose`|gammingmood> hmm
<GamerLuna> So many Pink mares
<Canadian_Brony> Personally, I prefer the VIP remix of Party with Pinkie, but the original is really good too.
<Rose`|gammingmood> we should have a loop of seasons 1, 2, and 3 of the chasers war on everything
<Princess> I was "kicked" ( whatever that is) by somepony, and had to change my name on this website chat.
<Jageman> Where did Celestia go?
<flutter_spin> alright. Change it.
<Jageman> ok
<Princess> I'm here
<Meanwhile> Newfoals can't ghostforce. Again.
<Stallion_of_War> Princess: That was daribot
<Kurra> What the hell eh?
<Kurra> What is this flash stream thing??
<Jageman> Princess: So, why don't the sun and moon appear in the sky at the same time?
<Princess> TO THE MOON, DARIBOT
<AttackWithHugs> Canadian_Brony, I like Trixie the Troll Pony original
<Derpy_Hooves> Princess: it's because you tried using the nick Luna, which is a bronystate staff member
<Vordox> GamerLuna: I wonder, have you seen the new intro for FFXIV? =3 It's quite a masterpiece of an intro
<Stallion_of_War> I think lightIRC can't handle all the pinkies
<Canadian_Brony> Kurra not funny dude.
<Kurra> I'm not annoyed, i'm just wondering where all my CPU eh
<Derpy_Hooves> oh, it was dari
<Princess> Oh.
<Derpy_Hooves> nvm
<Rose`|gammingmood> the chasers are amazing ;3
<Kurra> what's not funny?
<Rose`|gammingmood> i wub wub wub them
*Mistress_RainBowDash dances to the beat
<Princess> I love the name so.
<Buytoast2> what in the holy gum flapping donkey slaps is the movie square doing?
<Derpy_Hooves> doesn't mean you will be able to use it :P
<Canadian_Brony> Kurra you're misusing "eh". Do I have to PM you an essay on proper use of the Canadian language?
<CrystalPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353300232688.jpg
<Kurra> Canadian_Brony, pff whatever
<Princess> Luna, are you here?
<Jageman> Why don't I get answers?
<CrystalPhoenix> someone caption that picture
*Jageman feels ignored.
<CrystalPhoenix> or give them dialogue
<Lyra`> ill pay attention to you Jageman
<AssaultWithEmbraces> CrystalPhoenix, gonna attempt
<Princess> Jageman, I'm sorry
<FinnTheHuman> Hi
<Lyra`> how are you today, Jageman?
<Mistress_RainBowDash> TO MANY PINKIE PIES
<Canadian_Brony> CrystalPhoenix Poker Night at Midnight Castle
<GamerLuna> Vordox , yep, I do say so myself
<Princess> I'm not ignoring you. :)
<Jageman> Lyra`: I'm ok Lyra, how are you.
<FinnTheHuman> :) hello everyone
<Lyra`> fantastic :3
<Princess> <3 Jageman
<Canadian_Brony> hi FinnTheHuman
<Lyra`> as always~
<Derpy_Hooves> funfact: a strike to the adam's apple is instant death for us guys
<Vordox> GamerLuna: <3 I have faith in your wisdom. And glad to see someone else have seen it!
<Jageman> Princess: I know, i just did not get your answer.
<Vordox> The game may not be the game that fans wants, but it's a game we all can agree on, is good.
<Lyra`> funfact: chewing on a blasting cap is a bad idea
<Canadian_Brony> Lyra` why are you talking to yourself? I do it irl, but you're typing it in the chat.
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: May I ask how so?
*Kurra would like to take this moment to remind the admins that not everyone has 16GB of memory and 128 CPU cores to handle so much Pinkie Pie X_X
<Derpy_Hooves> AJIsAwesome: it crushed the wind pipe
<Deacon> Derpy_Hooves didn't know that
<AJIsAwesome> OH.
<FinnTheHuman> i <3 adventure time
<AJIsAwesome> Oh......
<Lyra`> i was talking to Jageman, Canadian_Brony
*FinnTheHuman is feeling radical!
<Princess> Jageman, The answer is, It is there so a blackhole doesn't appear
<Canadian_Brony> Lyra` oh, misread some stuff I guess.
<Lyra`> also, im a sociopath with PTSD, i can do whatever i like~
<Princess> ;)
<Mistress_RainBowDash> how did everypony like the new episode?
<Deacon> Mistress_RainBowDash it was.....really cartoony
<Vordox> Mistress_RainBowDash: Great Episode for Bronies.
<AJIsAwesome> I liked it.
<[SWAG]Haku> Um....
<[SWAG]Haku> What... is this?
<Kurra> My load average is 3.90 GYAAAAAH *critical hit*
<Jageman> Princess: You don't have both celestial bodies in the sky at the same time to prevent a singularity from forming?
<twilight_sprinkle> !cd
<AJIsAwesome> [SWAG]Haku: The universe.
<twilight_sprinkle> !cd
<Tom> Episode 4 of season 3 "One Bad Apple" airs in 5 days, 10 hours, 35 minutes, 20 seconds (Nov 24 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<something> hi eveypony
<Deacon> ollo [SWAG]Haku, pinkie pie apparently
<[SWAG]Haku> Why is the stream Pinkies
<AJIsAwesome> Why not?
<Saturn> 08,01Kurra: what are you running?
<twilight_sprinkle> sounds like an eyjey ep, i wonder if she'll get a song
<Princess> :|Yes, Jageman
<RainbowDashie> Hi
<something> hi ajisawsome
<[SWAG]Haku> Is this the new "No Stream, Sorry" thing?
<Kurra> Saturn, two cores. I'M NOT RICH DX
<Mistress_RainBowDash> Pinkie took over the stream
<Lyra`> yup, [SWAG]Haku
<FinnTheHuman> :| I HATE TRIXIE!
<Jageman> Princess: Thank you. That question has confounded me for a while now.
<GamerLuna> Hi RainbowDashie
<Lyra`> FinnTheHuman, thats an issue
<FinnTheHuman> 100% Hate Trixie
<twilight_sprinkle> hush, trixie is awesome
<[SWAG]Haku> nyeh
<Canadian_Brony> Mistress_RainBowDash I thought it was hilarious. I especially liked the "test". There actually is a fan-fiction called "Pinkie Watches Paint Dry", and I just laughed when I remembered. Then there was G3 Pinkie . . . *shudders*
<Vordox> I'm still waiting for when Luna gets her own song.. And Celestia.
<[SWAG]Haku> Trixie is best pony :|
<Afflict[phone]> whats up
<DoomSong> oh, its Mistress_RainBowDash on?
<DoomSong> oof~
<Meanwhile> Well, Trixie IS the worst pony.
<RainbowDashie> Hello, GamerLuna, How are you?
<FinnTheHuman> going to #ponychat
<Princess> Ok Jageman. Glad I helped
*Vordox bonks his hoof on Meanwhile
<FinnTheHuman> shit it cannot go
<something> trixie is the best
<DoomSong> we have some things to 'talk' about, Mistress_RainBowDash.
<FinnTheHuman> didn't mean to say that
<[SWAG]Haku> Trixie is best pony and I have the only reason needed to explain why
<Jageman> Lyra`: do you play anything else besides the lyre?
<GamerLuna> Im good, what about yourself?
<Princess> :P
<[SWAG]Haku> Fuck you, thats why
<Deacon> Vordox that might take forever to get to
<Mistress_RainBowDash> DoomSong: ummm what ?
<DoomSong> actually, i play the lyre, the harp, and jazz trumpet, irl
<Princess> :S
*Kurra goes into a 35-minute tirade about the injustices of forced planned obsolescence and unsusttainable computing and how the industry is invisibly bending up to its will and how it creates idols out of our electronics that it demands we worship through our wallets and....
<[SWAG]Haku> hmm
<Vordox> Deacon: Indeed I know.
<CrystalPhoenix> Oh my gosh
<AssaultWithEmbraces> CrystalPhoenix, I attempted and failed :I http://i.imgur.com/LWDOe.jpg
<Meanwhile> Kurra: tl;dr
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<CrystalPhoenix> The next episode has already leaked http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzEUeWnV73U
<Princess> >_>
<[SWAG]Haku> Im calling bull
<twilight_sprinkle> hmm, the jumping pinkies are neat,but i not being able to mute it is a problem
<Deacon> CrystalPhoenix XD
<Lyra`> and im working on the piano, because i want to play Nocturne Op 9 No 2 in e flat
<AJIsAwesome> CrystalPhoenix: And you're linking this here why? :S
<Lyra`> such a wonderful piece~
<PonyBean> i drew my pony avi..though i look more like starbuck coffe more than anything lol
<CrystalPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, if you bothered clicking you'll understand why
<something> ajisawsome u there
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/eThSP.gif
<[SWAG]Haku> nyeh
<RainbowDashie> I'm good GamerLuna
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: dont its still spoilers
<Vordox> Princess, are you okay, you keep changing your facial structure, trying something?
<twilight_sprinkle> goddamnit CrystalPhoenix seriously
<Saturn> 08,01Kurra: no, i mean what load are you running?
<Jageman> Lyra`: sounds hard to do with hooves.
<Deacon> twilight_sprinkle it's a joke
<Canadian_Brony> twilight_sprinkle no it isn't, it's a song called "One Bad Apple". It's not pony related in the slightest
<Kurra> Saturn 4.04 X_X
<Jageman> Lyra`: but i agree, it sounds beautiful
<CrystalPhoenix> Canadian_Brony, only Bad Apple
<[SWAG]Haku> So whats the topic for tonight, or there several conversations going on at the same time?
<Deacon> no idea
<something> drop the bass canon
<something> wait
<[SWAG]Haku> hmm
<something> wait
<twilight_sprinkle> Deacon: ah ok. still, annoying
<Canadian_Brony> CrystalPhoenix thx
<something> no
<Princess> Vordox, I'm over 3,000 years old.
<something> no
<Princess> That anwser your question?
<something> aww no drop the bass
<Lyra`> there is just something about this composition on the violin that brings tears to my eyes
<[SWAG]Haku> Princess please, I predate this universe
<Lyra`> its a painful beauty that pierces the soul
<Lyra`> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChJVhc285NU
<CrystalPhoenix> Chopin?
<Jageman> Princess: How old does your species normally live?
<Princess> Whatever [SWAG]Haku
<Canadian_Brony> dammit, how do you mute the stream?!?
<[SWAG]Haku> only onions
<CrystalPhoenix> oh gosh yes
<something> can some1 chage the song
<Saturn> 08,01Kurra: no, i mean what are you running that is putting it under load...
<Lyra`> the sorry and regret in the opening is enough to tear at the heartstrings of any music lover
<Princess> FOREVER
<Vordox> :$ Well, if that is what you wish to say.
<[SWAG]Haku> Princess you jelly, child?
<Kurra> Saturn, all these Pinkies X____X
<twilight_sprinkle> man how mute it
<Meanwhile> Why's chat devolved into 14 year olds.
<Jageman> Princess: sounds unsustainable.
<AJIsAwesome> Hey, who put this bowl of onions here?
<[SWAG]Haku> THERE SHOULD BE A VOLUME CONTROL FOR THIS THING
<Saturn> 08,01and is that load1, load5, or load15?
<Princess> No, ALL DA FILLIES JELLY OF ME
<Punkie_Pue> twilight_sprinkle: Pop it out and close it
<something> pinky pie overload chage it *boom*
<twilight_sprinkle> guess no choice but yo popout
<Kurra> Saturn ALL of them X_X
<Buytoast2> you know, are youtube links even allowed at the moment? technically, there is something on the stream
<Princess> Jageman, you are correct.
<twilight_sprinkle> Punkie_Pue: yeah thats what i was thinkiing
<Buytoast2> even if it is hundreds of hopping horses
<Meanwhile> Technically it isn't a stream, it's an embed.
<[SWAG]Haku> Princess Well, to me, you are a filly, so does this make you jelly-ception?
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Saturn
<Buytoast2> fair enough
<CrystalPhoenix> Buytoast2, good point but it's technically not live
<Saturn> 08,01...
<Jageman> Princess: so, when life on your world dies, you will be all alone forever?
<Saturn> 08,01you only have yourself to blame, then
<Lyra`> but the uplifting nature of a depressions exodus from the heart at the climax and finaly of the piece is a fluttery feeling in ones heart, a feeling of elation and happyness
<Saturn> 08,01hey Phase4!
<Canadian_Brony> twilight_sprinkle I'm running Chrome, which runs each tab and window as a seperate application, so I can just mute the BronyState tab. Otherwise, I got nothin'
<Lyra`> hey Saturn!, Phase4!
<Kurra> TT____TT
<Princess> Jageman, I have Luna and Cadence
*Phase4 00,02hugs Saturn and Lyra`
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Time for video games \:D/
<Jageman> Princess: With only your sister and discord for company?
<Kurra> What do you mean only myself, I don't have money for a million cores
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Refresh embed :3
<Jageman> Princess: Cadence too?
<something> chage it fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu *booooom*
<twilight_sprinkle> Canadian_Brony: do you use ctrl alt del for that or the windows audio mixer?
<Princess> Yes, Jageman
<Venus> 08,01Lyra`!
<Canadian_Brony> NewSuperBronyU does that mean . . . Wii U?
<Kurra> Oh heavens saved by gaming
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Yesh :3
<Vordox> NewSuperBronyU: Super Metroid?
<[SWAG]Haku> dodododo
<Canadian_Brony> Someone give me a motherfucking table to flip!
<CrystalPhoenix> Vordox, I think he gave up on that game long ago
<[SWAG]Haku> lalalalalal lala lalala
<something> newsuperbronyU can u chage the song
<Jageman> Princess: Sounds very sad.
<Buytoast2> more Block Caps Too?
*[SWAG]Haku gives Canadian_Brony a table
<Princess> [SWAG]Haku, You're the filly. I'm the princess. I'm old. I'm not a filly, idiot
<Jageman> Princess: What will you do when you outlive your world?
<Princess> Jageman, not as bad as it counds
<Canadian_Brony> wait, this ain't Wii U . . . WTF am I looking at?
<Meanwhile> If I refresh is the Wii going to come up?
<Vordox> Princess. your words and manners, please.
<Meanwhile> Because if so, fuck that, I'm leaving the Pinkie thing on.
<[SWAG]Haku> Princess Age is all about relevance. You may be 3000 years old, but I predate this existence. TO me, everypony is a child, including one as old as yourself
<Princess> Jageman, I will chat, play games ect.
<Buytoast2> if you refresh, you get nothing
<Mistress_RainBowDash> Pinkie really did take over the stream
<Buytoast2> except something telling you to go to another website
<Kurra> Meanwhile, you can't have Pinkie's when there's a stream, I think...
<Meanwhile> oh, that thing again.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02If it asks, you'll need to copy and paste the URL it shows in a new window to get to the stream.
<something> fuck i hate pinkypie chage it *boom*
<Canadian_Brony> twilight_sprinkle windows audio mixer, and it muted all of Chrome, so it kinda backfired..
<Lemony_Burst> hi
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hai Lemony_Burst :)
<something> hi
<Meanwhile> Kurra: Need to refresh to update the embed. I'm keeping my Pinkie spam.
<Kurra> oh okay.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02You see the stream?
<Kurra> YES
<Canadian_Brony> I do
<Lemony_Burst> Hi :D
<Princess> [SWAG]Haku, so if everypony is filly, that means you're one too.
<Meanwhile> Super why would you even use a service like that?
<twilight_sprinkle> Canadian_Brony: ah ok, thats what it does for me too
<Canadian_Brony> hi Lemony_Burst
<Lemony_Burst> hi canadian brony
<Jageman> Princess: you will not have a computer forever. when it break down what will you do?
<Princess> And, sorry Vordox
<[SWAG]Haku> BRB
<Mistress_RainBowDash> All bouncy pinkies
<Lemony_Burst> what are we watching?
<Princess> Jageman, I will heal it with my Alicorn powers.
<Canadian_Brony> Black Ops II on the Wii U I think..
<Vordox> Do not worry too much Princess, it's a common trait here that argument rises, it's just matters of talking to some of the younger ones, or older.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Black Ops II on the Wii U
<Lemony_Burst> oh 1 sec
<Jageman> Princess: even if you know how to fix all your games and electronics, how will they entertain you for all eternity.
<something> if u r wear headphones push then in ur ear
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Playing with the Wii Remote and Nunchuck
<Princess> Jageman, I can make some up.
<Jageman> Princess: and who will you chat with, when your world is dead.
<Princess> Ok, Vordox.
<Vordox> You know this all to well already, Princess.
<Lyra`> NewSuperBronyU!
<Kurra> Ow.
<Lemony_Burst> ok I can't see anything
<Princess> Jageman, Luna, Cadence, and Discord.
<Canadian_Brony> Okay, this is impressive.
<Punkie_Pue> That looks like itd be awkward
<RainbowDashie> HI EVERYPONY
<Jageman> Princess: how far can you go with games you made yourself, chatting with the same ponies everyday?
<Canadian_Brony> hi RainbowDashie
<Vordox> Sorry for undermining you in speech if you misunderstood me.
<Lemony_Burst> I am gonna go BYEEE!!!!!
<Canadian_Brony> dufuq was that throw?
<Princess> Vordox, YES i DO oops, caps
<Jageman> Princess: how long till everything that can be said has been.
<Princess> Jageman. I make a new world
<Kurra> This is why you check behind you.
<Lyra`> saturn!
<Jageman> Princess: How, you don't have that power.
<Lyra`> quick!
<Vordox> Hooves getin the way often, agreed Princess.
<Lyra`> You know what to do!
<Jageman> Princess: If you did, death would not happen in Equestria.
<Princess> Jageman. With help from Cadence and Luna.
<Princess> Jageman, of course.
<Jageman> Princess: your powers have limits
<Princess> How do yuo know, Jageman?
<Canadian_Brony> Knowing Black Ops II is on the Wii U kinda makes me want to play it . . . what is happening to me?!?
<Jageman> Princess: thats why you needed the elements of harmony
<Lyra`> Canadian_Brony, is it snowing for you?
<Canadian_Brony> I . . . /want/ . . . to buy a cod game.
<Princess> Until Twilight showed up.
<Princess> - evil laughter -
<MahBoi777> <.<
<Jageman> Princess: Discord would not be a threat if you were all powerful.
<CrystalPhoenix> Canadian_Brony, DON'T DO IT BRO
<Canadian_Brony> Lyra` it hasn't snowed since mid-October., unfortunately.
<Princess> Of course, she doesn't live eternily.
<Lyra`> :o
*twilight_sprinkle glomps MahBoi777 :3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14mfw I leave a twitch stream for Melee
<Princess> Discord would if he loved me. For attention. To look powerful.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and then I see a Twitch embed
<Jageman> Princess: everything ends Celestia.
<Princess> Not me.
<Lyra`> SaxyPretender, such a thing exist?
<Princess> Or Luna, Cadence or Discord
<Canadian_Brony> CrystalPhoenix meh, I'll consider when I (hopefully) get the Wii U sometime next year. Probably will go for ZombiU instead.
<Jageman> Princess: there are no exceptions
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, people are still playing Melee
<Kurra> Why does it take like 7 rounds to drop a person who's two inches away? :|
<CrystalPhoenix> Yeah
<SaxyPretender> 0,14if that's what you mean
<Lyra`> ZOMG!
<CrystalPhoenix> ZombiU looks way more interesting
<Lyra`> oh, mhy friend NewSuperBronyU is streaming <3
<Jageman> Princess: even reality itself has an end point.
<Princess> I have ALL knowledge. Jageman.
<Lyra`> i honestly like him.
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: Well, it IS a good game. :3
<Lyra`> hes a great guy
<CrystalPhoenix> then again maybe more interesting game might come out by that time
<Lyra`> lets say nice things about him
<CrystalPhoenix> *coughBayonetta2cough*
<SaxyPretender> 0,14tru dat, AJIsAwesome
<Princess> I'm magical dumbplot, Jageman.
<SpeccyRush> SaxyPretender: lemme guess, there was 15 more warmups
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so many warmups you could cook an egg
<twilight_sprinkle> avenger!revenge!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02OH SHIT BACKUP BACKUP
<Jageman> Princess: oh, so Queen Crysalis snuck by you because you wanted her to, right?
<Lyra`> haha
<Canadian_Brony> CrystalPhoenix but I also have a friend who might get it for PS3. I know the experience will be different, but I'll get a rough feeling for what I'm putting cold, hard cash into
<Kurra> XDDD
<Kurra> But seriously, like always more than one bullet to kill someone in this game, why
<Jageman> Princess: she also defeted you.
<Princess> Jageman, you are really smart. Figure it a\out
<Princess> Twilight defeated HER
<soulrider95> Kurra: If the game was perfectly realistic, it would be boring :)
<Jageman> Princess: I know you don't have all the answers.
<Jageman> Princess: you have limits
<Princess> Jageman, so do you
<Jageman> Princess: Accept them
<Kurra> soulrider95, Rainbow Six was like that, challenging as hell.
<Princess> You to
<Jageman> Princess: I never stated i did not.
<CrystalPhoenix> well at least you'll get to try it without spending a cent AJIsAwesome
<Jageman> Princess: I know i will end some day
<AJIsAwesome> CrystalPhoenix: ?
<Jageman> Princess: nothing is forever
<soulrider95> Kurra: it may be good for single player, but in multiplayer getting killed by one bullet from anything kinda makes balance difficult.
<Princess> Jageman, you said everything has a limit. So does knowledge
<Vordox> Hehe.
<Canadian_Brony> CrystalPhoenix umm, did you mean to ping me?
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<CrystalPhoenix> OOOPS
<Jageman> Princess: yes
<CrystalPhoenix> yeah
<CrystalPhoenix> trololololo
<CrystalPhoenix> sorry AJ
<Princess> Jageman, exactly :)
<AJIsAwesome> It's cool.
<CrystalPhoenix> it's late
<Canadian_Brony> Oh yeah, and I defenitely won't buy it if I can't Prone Dive. God DAMN that is fun!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:(
<Jageman> Princess: so, what is your limit?
<soulrider95> Canadian_Brony: You can dolphin dive in this game.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Canadian_Brony: You can prone dive in this game
<Kurra> Oh hell, killed by a UAV :(
<Canadian_Brony> Yay!
<Princess> Jageman, of what? knowlegde, age, ect?
<Jageman> Princess: why didn't you know about the queen changling in your own house?
<soulrider95> Anyone else play this on PC?
<Canadian_Brony> Kurra UAV is radar..
<Kurra> :p
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The Wii U Pro controller can last up to 80 hours on a single charge O.O
<Canadian_Brony> IKR?
<Kurra> well, killed by some kind of aircraft...
<MahBoi777> NewSuperBronyU: whoa o_o
<Jageman> Princess: where you too focused on external threats to see the one inside?
<Lyra`> that long?
<Lyra`> wowsers
<Princess> Jageman, that is in the past. Focus on the present. That's over now
<twilight_sprinkle> wiiu, now can last up to 80 hours of updates on a single charge!
<soulrider95> NewSuperBronyU: *up to, I doubt it will last nearly that long under use.
<Princess> Twilight is the one you should be interviewing.
<Jageman> Princess: So, you admit you made a mistake and want to move passed it.
<Canadian_Brony> Lyra` I considered saying "That's what she said", but it wouldn't be funny 'cause you're a girl..
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Okay I'm back for like the 20th time today
<Jageman> Princess: I like you.
<Princess> Yes Jageman, we all do
<Kimori> x.x too much
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I hope I don't have to do anything
<SaxyPretender> 0,14technially, wouldn't that be what she actually said, Canadian_Brony
<Princess> Thank you Jageman. I like you
<Afflict[phone]> :(
<Princess> Stop by the palace and stay a while if you want Jageman.
<Jageman> Princess: I like anyone who can admit their mistakes, but not let those mistakes stop them from doing their duty.
<Deacon> black ops eh?
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<Canadian_Brony> SaxyPretender that's why it wouldn't be funny! And I've seen someone try a "That's what she said" on a girl. She kicked him in the nuts, which was hilarious :D
<Jageman> Princess: Both you and your sister have my deepest respects.
<Princess> Yes Jageman.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<Princess> Thank you. Jageman, where is Luna?
<Princess> Must be at bed.
<Deacon> Canadian_Brony uh, ouch
<Jageman> Princess: what time is it there?
<RainbowDashie> Nope sis, Im right here,
<Canadian_Brony> Deacon it's funny when it doesn't happen to you.
<Princess> 12:18
<Princess> Jageman.
<GamerLuna> Princess, Im still here
<Deacon> Canadian_Brony still, ouch though
<Jageman> Princess: I though it was nighttime in equestria?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Oi, Princess and GamerLuna, tone down on the roleplaying
<Kurra> Blockt
<SaxyPretender> 0,14this isn't a roleplaying channel
<Jageman> Princess: or does equestia not sync up with earth time?
<Princess> Oh, Luna! Hello! <3
<killerpony7733> SaxyPretender Finally someone said it to them
<Canadian_Brony> Deacon he's fine, don't worry. He had a cold can of beer on hand.
<Jageman> GamerLuna: there you are.
<Kurra> Equestria has 30 minuts of daylight and 30 of night, enough to film one episode.
<GamerLuna> Haha, heeyyyyyyyy Jageman
<Princess> Jageman, We are at night. Our time is different froms humans.
<Jageman> GamerLuna: Celestia and I have been talking.
<GamerLuna> about what?
<killerpony7733> SaxyPretender Someones not getting the message :S
<AJIsAwesome> Please take it easy with the RP, Princess and GamerLuna. :)
<Jageman> Princess: you have a different arbitrary way of mesuring time?
<DerpyMuffins> There is a roleplaying channeling?
<Slenderman> Jageman: You? Talk to Celestia? About GamerLuna? Are you insane?
<Kurra> Pff, what RP :p
<Jageman> GamerLuna: about stuff?
<Princess> Jageman, no
<Kurra> is not problem.
<GamerLuna> What stuff Jageman?
<Jageman> GamerLuna: mostly about limits.
<Princess> There is no ' role playing' AJisAwesome
<Jageman> GamerLuna: about the fact that nothing is forever.
<Kurra> Now is Forever... o/~
<GamerLuna> nothing is forever?
<Jageman> GamerLuna: everything fades in time.
<Derpy_Hooves> Princess: actually acting like your celestia is called roleplaying
<GamerLuna> well, yeah
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I have chocolate chips!
<AJIsAwesome> You are taking on a persona of a character, that is considered RP.
<Vordox> My dear Jagerman, you do know of the energy of our cosmos, do you not?
<AJIsAwesome> AssaultWithEmbraces: :O
*Kurra takes on his fursona in here, he RPs too
<Kurra> persona/ponysona
<Princess> I AM Celestia. Derpy_Hooves
<kirzstryfe> inb4 SaxyPretender cleans up the room
<Vordox> Jageman, keeping with that, no energy can be "ended".
<Jageman> Vordox: You will never convince me that anything is eternal, not without lots of evidence
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsAwesome, yep. Gonna make chocolate pancakes tomorrow morning.
<Meanwhile> Inb4 "Are you ok"
<killerpony7733> kirzstryfe Please for the love of the mane chat this is getting really annoying
<Vordox> Jageman: Then what is the point if your discussion if it's never meant to bend?
<AJIsAwesome> AssaultWithEmbraces: Sounds AWESOME. :O
<kirzstryfe> I'd kill it if I could :p
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsAwesome because it is.
<Canadian_Brony> AssaultWithEmbraces mmm, those are good . . .
<Vordox> Greetings kirzstryfe !
<Kurra> it's not annoying.... c.c
<Jageman> Vordox: energy does not end, but it does fade out of this universe
<AssaultWithEmbraces> First time I ever made pancakes, I made them huge.
<AJIsAwesome> AssaultWithEmbraces: :O
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Didn't want pancakes for 3 weeks after that
<Kurra> XD
<kirzstryfe> the rp does get annoying, it's not like it's difficult to go off and make your own channel for it
<Vordox> Jageman: It cannot fade, which is an oddity since Energy is, by all terms proven, eternal.
<Canadian_Brony> kirzstryfe you've got strong ties to the inner networks. Get them to do it for you
<Kurra> pancakes. make 'em with chocolate chips
<Jageman> Vordox: through the membranes that make up matter/energy.
<Derpy_Hooves> Princess: good for you, but acting like her in this channel is called rp :P
<Jageman> Vordox: energy is not eternal
<SaxyPretender> 0,14All right
<Canadian_Brony> Wait a second, you can watch YouTube videos on the gamepad?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that's it
<Princess> I AM real Derpy_Hooves
<killerpony7733> kirzstryfe True but did said ponies try and stop when asked?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14It's kicking time
<Jageman> Vordox: if it was, the universe would be eternal
<killerpony7733> Inb4 kicks
<Deacon> Kurra even better, use some pecans, delish :P
<AskPeachy> http://emoxfurryxrave.deviantart.com/#/d5lk5qe
<CrystalPhoenix> Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand night for me
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Kicking time
<CrystalPhoenix> Good night everyone
<AJIsAwesome> Night, CrystalPhoenix.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Night CrystalPhoenix
<Kurra> You wanna see annoying? Have someone roleplay GILDA. And then give them ops. That's a freaking totalitarian regime in channel, fluff.
<Canadian_Brony> g'night CrystalPhoenix
<Princess> Hello
<Jageman> Vordox: energy has a begining, and mathimaticly has an end.
<Meanwhile> Mathematically*
<Jageman> Vordox: unless you factor in string theory
<Princess> I was kicked :'(
<Meanwhile> beginning*
<Kurra> honestly it's soothing that someone would play at characters who are gentle, overall.
<Princess> AGAIN :'(
<Jageman> thank you meenwhile
<killerpony7733> Princess Then stop RP'ing
<Jageman> lol
<Princess> JUST HAVIIIIIINNNNNNNNGGG FUN!
<Meanwhile> Maybe you wouldn't be kicked if you did as you were told and stopped being a gimboid.
<Buytoast2> roleplaying is forbidden here you know
<Buytoast2> you had it coming
<killerpony7733> Princess Not if your breaking rules
<DerpyMuffins> Going back to basic NewSuperBronyU?
*Kurra roleplays a character.
<Meanwhile> you're*
<Derpy_Hooves> Meanwhile what's a gimboid? :3
<killerpony7733> Know how to have fun without breaking the damn rules
<Princess> killerpony7733 Just having fun is breaking the rules?
<Vordox> Jageman: No, String Theory is not taken into account, the argument would be not able to change then.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02DerpyMuffins: Brawl time :3
<Meanwhile> Derpy_Hooves: It's British slang used to describe the stupid.
*Kurra sit
<Derpy_Hooves> Meanwhile kewl, learin new things all day erry day
<Derpy_Hooves> \:3/
<Canadian_Brony> Meanwhile you're british?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I'm nervous about transferring everything over from my old Wii to the new Wii U, so I'm just going to keep using my old system for Wii content for a while longer :)
<Vordox> Mister Jagerman, however with that, Energy is eternal by all means due to transformation from Energy to matter and back to energy, causing an endless cycle. If that's not infinite, I do not know where you would look at else.
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Derpy_Hooves
<Kurra> More annoying than people roleplaying, is the massive fight erupting over people roleplaying.
<DashWithRainbows> No, Meanwhile is Russian.
<Meanwhile> Da.
<Kurra> Much more so.
<DashWithRainbows> See?
<PrincessCelestia> Hello
<killerpony7733> Princess If you RP here yes. Theres other places for that on this network. So this place isn't your own amusement park obey rules if you want to stay or find a more suited place or if you can't do neither you should just stop
<AJIsAwesome> Kurra: I understand, but this isn't a RP channel. RP is technically discouraged here.
<PrincessCelestia> I was kicked :'(
<Meanwhile> Yeah we know.
<Jageman> Vordox: The universe is not eternal, neither is time. it had a beginning.
<Meanwhile> We saw it happen.
<Meanwhile> Jesus.
<DerpyMuffins> Awesome chorus as always NewSuperBronyU
<DashWithRainbows> Because you're roleplaying.
<PrincessCelestia> And I wan't breaking the rules
<Meanwhile> YOU WERE.
*AssaultWithEmbraces facepalms for the chat
<DashWithRainbows> Yes, you were.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02DerpyMuffins: Yesh :3
<Meanwhile> OH MY GOOOOOOOD.
<killerpony7733> I smell ban
<Buytoast2> goddamn, your head must be thicker than a coconut
<AssaultWithEmbraces> killerpony7733, so do I
<Vordox> Jageman: The universe is a space of matter and energy, and it'll expand and then the reverse, but once it's collapsed, a new energy and mater from those causes another existance, therefore, a cycle.
<PrincessCelestia> HOW IS THAT BREAKING THE RULES? oops caps please dont kick me
<Canadian_Brony> NewSuperBronyU this is why you stick everything on an SD card, copy all the files onto your computer, transfer one file copy to your Wii U and leave the rest on your Wii. Surprisingly useful.
<DashWithRainbows> PrincessCelestia http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
<Meanwhile> The skull is actually about as thick as a coconut.
<DashWithRainbows> Go freshen up on them.
<AJIsAwesome> Because RP is discouraged here, PrincessCelestia.
<Jageman> Vordox: the universe will not collapse
<Deacon> ok, just calm down PrincessCelestia, and everyone else
<Buytoast2> well fine, thicker than a steel ball
<Buytoast2> either way
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Would everyone kindly take their right or left hand and place it on their forehead? Thank you and have a nice day.
<Derpy_Hooves> BALLLLZ OF STEEL
<Kurra> Yeah Deacon.
<Jageman> Vordox: that model has lost credit due to observation
<PrincessCelestia> why is it? It shouldn't be
<Meanwhile> Yeah the thickness is above safe parametres.
<Canadian_Brony> AssaultWithEmbraces why did I just do that..
<PrincessCelestia> Its just fun
<Vordox> Jageman: So if it doesn't collapse, it's eternal? Your argument is ripping holes in your own statements.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Canadian_Brony, becuase the Force
<NocturnalBlade> Good morning everypony :)
<Canadian_Brony> riiiiiiight >.>
<Deacon> yo NocturnalBlade
<PrincessCelestia> And I love Celestia
<Canadian_Brony> hi NocturnalBlade
<PrincessCelestia> :'(
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, NocturnalBlade.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Night, NocturnalBlade
<Jageman> Vordox: you misunderstand
*Kurra fret :<
<DashWithRainbows> Well, go roleplay in another chatroom.
<killerpony7733> PrincessCelestia Sorry but your definitation of fun is against the chat rules. So find a suited place for it not here when it annoys people
<NocturnalBlade> AssaultWithEmbraces: lol like the name ^_^
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Canadian_Brony, :3
<Jmo> Chav
<Kurra> Ffffffff....
<Jageman> Vordox: the universe is expanding at an increasing rate
<DashWithRainbows> What Aussie chav?
<Kurra> I have less than 2GB space.
<Jmo> Go chat in another chatroom.
<Derpy_Hooves> jmo why are you talking?! GAWD
<Derpy_Hooves> :V
<PrincessCelestia> Well if I'm hated here why not?
<DashWithRainbows> Nah.
<DerpyMuffins> Cya everypony
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bye DerpyMuffins
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, DerpyMuffins.
<Canadian_Brony> seeya DerpyMuffins
<AskPeachy|-_-> did anypony view the picture
<Jmo> Now you british prick. :|
<Jageman> Vordox: eventually it will expand so fast it will rip itself appart
<killerpony7733> PrincessCelestia Your not hated but you annoy people
<Deacon> PrincessCelestia no worrie, you're not hated
*NocturnalBlade hugs Deacon Canadian_Brony AJIsAwesome and AssaultWithEmbraces
<Meanwhile> You're*
<AskPeachy|-_-> my name is ghosting again
<NocturnalBlade> bye DerpyMuffins
<Canadian_Brony> AskPeachy ehh, which one?
*Derpy_Hooves hugs Jmo \:3/
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Canadian_Brony: Content is linked to the system, it's either I transfer everything over at once or nothing at all.
<PrincessCelestia> How do I annoy?
<Meanwhile> PrincessCelestia: I hate you. Just to be clear.
*Deacon hugs NocturnalBlade :D
<Jmo> Why are you hugging me?
*AssaultWithEmbraces hugs Jmo
<AJIsAwesome> Why not?
<NocturnalBlade> :O Brawl!
<Vordox> I know that already Jageman, but you forgot the very basic rule, the pulling forces.
<Jageman> Vordox: after that, physics does not know anthing.
<DashWithRainbows> By roleplaying in a channel that isn't one for such things.
<Derpy_Hooves> Jmo cause you kewl :3
<PrincessCelestia> meawhile...
<Jmo> Right.
<DashWithRainbows> >Joomay >Cool
<DashWithRainbows> I'm sorry
<Jmo> I'm not even cool.
<DashWithRainbows> There is a huge flaw in your logic.
<Jageman> Vordox: please be more specific
<Jmo> Your birth was a flaw in logic Chav.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Smash Bros. on the Wii U is going to be amazing o.o
<AJIsAwesome> ...
<Vordox> The observation of the universe do not disapprove if it'll become pulled back into it's original form.
<DashWithRainbows> :OOOOO
<DashWithRainbows> Gimme some burn cream.
<PrincessCelestia> :'(
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I don't know which side of that to watch, the no-rp part, the science, or the "sane" part
<killerpony7733> PrincessCelestia You should just not RP here that's it. Cause this channel is not a roleplaying channel. Just talk with people in general and discuss interests just not roleplay
<Vordox> The amount of time to see that is probable even longer then the earth's life current life cycle, and even if then it'll almost be impossible to measure even with that in mind.
<Meanwhile> All I can see is gibberish.
<Jmo> You see gibberish, I see bullshit.
<Meanwhile> Same difference Moojay.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I see strawberry poptarts
<Jmo> One is more enforced.
<SpeccyRush> AssaultWithEmbraces: nice new nick
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Thanks, SpeccyRush

<Soarin> HI!
<Canadian_Brony> hi Soarin
<Kimori> on the bright side, I got skylanders giants today
<Jageman> Vordox: there is no evidence that the universe will be pulles into a big crunch
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi Soarin
<Soarin> HI
<Vordox> Jageman: And there's evidence that it'll rip?
<Kurra> Every hour on the hour... :|
<Jageman> Vordox: no, the only evidence right now supports the big freeze
<Soarin> .
<NocturnalBlade> hi Soarin
<Afflict[phone]> oh awesome. Did you play it at all?
<Vordox> Jageman: The big freeze?
<Soarin> hi NocturnalBlade
<AssaultWithEmbraces> We already said hi, Soarin. You silly filly~
<Jageman> Vordox: the universe will expand soo big that all the energy will be spread too thin
<Vordox> Jageman: Sounds like when things expand too far, it'll cause all the heat to be drawn out over huge area and causes freeze?
<haseo348> hello everypony
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, haseo348.
<haseo348> oh smash brother
<haseo348> s

<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: All you need to see is a Smash Bros Tourney.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I can easily host one at my club
<Vordox> Jageman: But wouldn't the vacuum of space cause a force to bring the universe together once more?
<[SWAG]Haku> What is this box that say some URL with SB64's name on my stream?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Smash is, unsurprisingly, really popular

<GamerLuna> Sup, SOar
<Soarin> Heyt
<Soarin> Hey, GamerLuna
<haseo348> lol you so sillly
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: Because you have your favorite characters beating the heck out of each other. :D
<Jageman> Vordox: a vacuum would only do that if there was pressure on the outside of the universe pushing in
<[SWAG]Haku> hmmhmm
<Derpy_Hooves> oops
<SaxyPretender> 0,14personally, I prefer other fighters like Soul Calibur V, Persona 4 Arena and Guilty Gear, but Smash is also fun to watch
<Vordox> Jageman: And we have any proof of it NOT being therE?
<NocturnalBlade> SaxyPretender: nice choices ^_^
<Jageman> Vordox: yes
<Vordox> SaxyPretender: blazblue
<haseo348> SaxyPretender: what about ultimate marvel vs capcom 3?
<NocturnalBlade> Vordox: love it
<Jageman> Vordox: the universe is not collapsing
<haseo348> o...o i say its a pretty decent fighter.
<Vordox> Jageman: Please do tell me where you find your fact that there's no outside push from outside the observable Universe.

<Kimori> no time :/
<PrincessCelestia> Deacon
<Kimori> I got the 3ds version
<Jageman> Vordox: the expansion from the big bang is not the cause of the current expansion.
<Soarin> who has a pie?
<Deacon> yo PrincessCelestia!
<PrincessCelestia> yes
<PrincessCelestia> deacon, what is it?
<Afflict[phone]> oh
<Jageman> Vordox: if it was, the energy would still be present
<RaveBrony> Like instead of pressing 'alt-tab', I actually have to click 'minimize'
<[SWAG]Haku> Derpy is best Captain Falcon
<Deacon> oh, nothing PrincessCelestia
<Kimori> ill get to it when I can
<Phase4> yeah, just keep something else ontop while it loads
<Jageman> Vordox: and our planet would not have cooled

<OneTrickPony1> hi AdamTheDuck
<Jageman> Vordox: we are using them to map the history of the universe
<pony4285> Fuuuuuuu
<pony4285> I keep forgetting I enforced my nick ;~;
<killerpony7733> Deacon I just thought it sounded like that
<Vordox> Jageman: Then how do you put this in conjecture with Dark Energy?
<Jageman> Vordox: dark energy is just a label for energy that we don't understand yet
<PrincessCelestia> OFF TO OMEGLE
<Soarin> WHO HAS PIE?!?!
<PrincessCelestia> bye everypony <3
<Deacon> seeya PrincessCelestia :D
<NocturnalBlade> bye PrincessCelestia
<MahBoi777> PIE?where?!
<Vordox> Jageman: I thought it was the term for explaining the expansion of the universe.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Later PrincessCelestia :)
<AdamTheDuck> COOKIEZ 030
<[SWAG]Haku> Pi = 3.14159265
<AdamTheDuck> Bye PrincessCelestia
<Vordox> And is one of the main causes of that effect.
<Jageman> Vordox: the universe is expanding at a faster rate every second
<PrincessCelestia> i do soarin
<MahBoi777> bye PrincessCelestia
<PrincessCelestia> before i go, ill give it to you
<Jageman> Vordox: inorder for it to expand faster energy has to be applied
<Flaria> Err. Okay. Busy.
<[SWAG]Haku> good punch
<Soarin> PrincessCelestia, Give what to who?
<Jageman> Vordox: we don't know where the energy is comeing fomr
<PrincessCelestia> BYE EVERYPONY HERE'S YOUR PIE, SOARIN?
<Jageman> Vordox: from*
<PrincessCelestia> BYE EVERYPONY <3
<Jageman> Vordox: so we call it dark energy
<Soarin> oh thanks PrincessCelestia! YOURE THE BEST PRINCESS
<[SWAG]Haku> So how do people play this online?
<Derpy_Hooves> you and those fucking fans
<Vordox> Jageman: I see, well, we don't know, so why are we talking about something we don't know?
<Jageman> Vordox: because we can measure its effects on reality
<Jageman> Vordox: so it exsists, we just don't have a working theory on why or where it comes from
<Derpy_Hooves> gg
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Moo :)
<Jageman> Vordox: same with dark matter
<[SWAG]Haku> nyeh :/
<Vordox> Jageman: This is way above my head.
<Vordox> But I sitll believe in the whole debacle of the Big Crunch.
<Jageman> Vordox: the observable universe has more gravity than can be visually messured
<Vordox> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_model
<Jageman> Vordox: the cyclic model is not currently supported be observations

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02You need to load the link that appears in the embed
<Jageman> Vordox: anyway, like i said, the unless something drastic and unexplainable happens, the universe will either go into big rip, or more likely, big freeze

<Jageman> AdamTheDuck: No, he is a vampire. He does not sleep.
*AJIsAwesome is smacked by the pillow :D
<kirzstryfe> I understand that SB, but don't you think there's an issue using an embed that actively redirects people off of the site?
<Jageman> AdamTheDuck: He only pretends to sleep.
<Meanwhile> Kirz: Naaaaaaah.

<AssaultWithEmbraces> That awkwardly dancing audience
<J_E_Smith71> NewSuperBronyU: I don't understand though, I had no problem with running the embed without leaving Bronystate. Pushing the play button allowed the embed to work and let me watch it here
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02btw, Desert Bus for Hope is happening now if any of you are interested. They're trying to raise money to be donated to charity.

<Meanwhile> My embed failed to play on cue
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: Link please? :)

<HoodyNinja> Then why is it in the stream box?
<twilight_sprinkle> and thats why didnt refresh embed
<BlaxBlain> God save the stream
<Stormy`> and a couple people hugged me :P
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: I don't know to be happy or scared
<Jageman> HoodyNinja: is a scripted animation
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: both
<Jageman> i have it turned off
<Stormy`> no good panels this year though =/ and I don't know enough about anime to understand most of the costumes and merchandise
<Jageman> the music got annoying
<BlaxBlain> How?
<XylemTube> music is epic
<Afflict[phone]> haha awesome
<Jageman> press the popout button
<BlaxBlain> How does turn off!!!!
<HoodyNinja> Meh I don't want to turn it off
<BlaxBlain> Thank you
<Jageman> then close it
<AssaultWithEmbraces> BlaxBlain, it's Pinkie.
<Afflict[phone]> not that though
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah its a neat idea, but could really i use a vlume control option
<AssaultWithEmbraces> One does not simply turn off a stream full of Pinkie
<HoodyNinja> Bstate background music
<HoodyNinja> Genious
<twilight_sprinkle> >genious
<twilight_sprinkle> hoodi pls
<HoodyNinja> I misspelled it, din't I
<AdamTheDuck> I want "Lalalalalalala" as BrownieStaet's background music. ;~;
<twilight_sprinkle> naw >_>
<Jageman> twilight_sprinkle: your computer does not have individual volume control for different progams?
<OneTrickPony> who put that as the stream?
<HoodyNinja> Geneous
<HoodyNinja> Geneeus
<HoodyNinja> Djiiniyus
<Kimori> you gotta ask Amu on that
<AJIsAwesome> Genieus
<Kimori> she will know :)
<HoodyNinja> ;~;
<AssaultWithEmbraces> genis
<OneTrickPony> wat
<twilight_sprinkle> Jageman: yeah but i would have to mute all of chrome, i dont know if it will work if i separate it into a new window
<Kimori> You dressed up?
<Jageman> genius?
<HoodyNinja> Genous
<OneTrickPony> genesis
<AssaultWithEmbraces> JENGA!
<HoodyNinja> CONGA
*HoodyNinja forms a conga
<twilight_sprinkle> coconut
*AssaultWithEmbraces gets in the conga line
*OneTrickPony joins conga
<HoodyNinja> coa-coa butter
<Jageman> twilight_sprinkle: i have an app that controls the volume for the tabs separately
<OneTrickPony> cats!
<Stormy`> Yeah, I'll have to get a picture
<OneTrickPony> Jageman: can I have?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Chocolate
<twilight_sprinkle> Jageman: oh nice, whats it called?
<Jageman> i think it only works on firefox though
<Stormy`> Or maybe someone posted theirs online somewhere
<twilight_sprinkle> oh, well ill have to search something like that for chrome
<Jageman> and its prone to crashing sometimes
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Did my stream load up properly?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> SpadeMagnes[R], yes it did. Why?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Im getting a bunch of pinkie pies...I hope thats normal
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Yep that's normal
<Meanwhile> If your stream is FUN then it's working as intended.
<Shizuka> 13FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN
<AdamTheDuck> XD
<Meanwhile> Like everything ever released by Blizzard.
<OneTrickPony> lol
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I love Blizzard says stuff is working as intended when it sometimes isnt, I find it funny
<Buytoast> It never ends.
<HoodyNinja> It isn't supposed too
<AdamTheDuck> Now to open up 300 Pinkie desktop ponies to complete this.
<OneTrickPony> I just did a popout of the chat
<HoodyNinja> That wouldn't be fun
<Jageman> i went looking for it, but i guess in uninstalled it.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AdamTheDuck, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<OneTrickPony> AdamTheDuck: inb4 crash
<AssaultWithEmbraces> You trying to destroy computers that way
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Needs more pinkie pie
<HoodyNinja> AdamTheDuck: Inb4 cra...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> 600 pinkie pies
<SpadeMagnes[R]> DO IT
<HoodyNinja> OneTrickPony: Damn you to hell
<OneTrickPony> HoodyNinja: XD
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I stand by "Never enough Pinkie" but I also stand by having a working hard drive, too
<Kimori> ok
<AssaultWithEmbraces> So that makes no sense!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Try 300 of all the mane 6
<twilight_sprinkle> inb4 a twi appears in the embed and starts killing off the pinkies
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Result? Profit
<PrincessLuna> good evening everypony
<Jageman> i think my graphics card could handle 300 pinkies but my main processor might have some trouble
*AssaultWithEmbraces covers twilight_sprinkle's mouth "Shhhh, don't tempt them"
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Step 1 Open Desktop Ponies
<OneTrickPony> hiya PrincessLuna
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Step 2 Make 300 Pinkies
<Stormy`> I have tons of homework to do now though :(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Step 4 Profit
<twilight_sprinkle> AssaultWithEmbraces: heh i wonder if someone will make a game for it
<Stormy`> I put it off and it turns out it was a lot more than I expected
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi PrincessLuna
<Kimori> x.x I hate that when it happens
<AssaultWithEmbraces> twilight_sprinkle, inb4 someone is making it right now. You see how fast Cadence Toss came out.
<Kimori> Ive had some days where I stayed up almost all night to get it done
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So did the stream crash or something?
<totheark> This is awfully quiet for bronystate standards.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Whoever has the most Pinkies on their desktop without their computer crashing wins
<HoodyNinja> ITS 12 O FUCKING CLOCK
<Jageman> i found an extention for chome that lets you mute individual tabs
<twilight_sprinkle> AssaultWithEmbraces: yeah, their probably will be a game like it
<HoodyNinja> SMART PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING
<AdamTheDuck> i.http://imgur.com/S2hhi
<Meanwhile> I think you'll find according to my clock it's 6:32.
<Bigcheese> AssaultWithEmbraces: that's trivial.
<Jageman> its called mutetab
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: There could also be insomniacs.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bigcheese, pfft how
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its 12:32 here
<twilight_sprinkle> bitch please, i got a physics quiz in 7 hours, i aint sleepin yet
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Fuck sleep

<HoodyNinja> Damn you logic
<AssaultWithEmbraces> 1:32am
<AdamTheDuck> Worth it.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sleep is for wusses
<Jmo> Watch out, children are cool cause they're staying up.
<Bigcheese> AssaultWithEmbraces: raster. Use a single frame buffer and keep rastering more on.
<HoodyNinja> Meanwhile: You're not on 'Murikin time, do'nt count
<Stormy`> I actually have stayed up all night many times
<Bigcheese> Finite memory!
<RoboGerbil> needs 20% more pinkie
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I live in Murkia
<Stormy`> Thanks to my evil major
<Meanwhile> HoodyNinja: I'm on English time, so I'm automatically right.
<Jageman> AdamTheDuck: how many fps are you running now?
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Murkia?
<AdamTheDuck> I have no idea Jageman...
<HoodyNinja> Meanwhile: Does that make me left?
<Meanwhile> HoodyNinja: Yes.
<HoodyNinja> SWEET!
*HoodyNinja is now oot link
<Meanwhile> As in, left in the dark.
<Jageman> its 2334 here, im going to bed
<HoodyNinja> Still fucking left

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Two wrongs dont make a right, two lefts make a right
<Meanwhile> Or, left behind.
<AdamTheDuck> stay outta my IRC chat :D
*HoodyNinja throws a car
<Meanwhile> Left 4 Dead.
<Jageman> btw: Im a time traveler from the future.
<totheark> Doctor?
<HoodyNinja> Oh really?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Whoa who's throwing cars?
*SpadeMagnes[R] plays the Song of Time
<Jageman> the year 2015
<HoodyNinja> I thought you would be from the past
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Did you download that, mister?
<Stormy`> wow, my computer is slow today for no apparent reason =/
*SpadeMagnes[R] throws the chatroom into the air
<Stormy`> I hate when that happens
<HoodyNinja> WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
*HoodyNinja lands on SpadeMagnes[R]
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ow
<AdamTheDuck> 300 Pinkies only use about 20% of my CPU
<Jageman> i just wanted to tell everyone that, nothing really changes in 3 years
<Jageman> so don't worry
<SpadeMagnes[R]> AdamTheDuck: You actually fucking did it?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Wait, where do I get the Desktop ponies? the site is down
<AdamTheDuck> SpadeMagnes[R], http://i.imgur.com/S2hhi.jpg
<RoboGerbil> AdamTheDuck: so you could easily put 1000 pinkies in there
<AdamTheDuck> I assume so, but the max is 300
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Da fauq kind of computer are you using mang?
<AJIsAwesome> AssaultWithEmbraces: I think it's been shut down.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Damn
<AdamTheDuck> SpadeMagnes[R], just a custom one I built a year or two ago .-.
<RoboGerbil> there a stream?
<NocturnalBlade> i have the file and could give you a copy AssaultWithEmbraces
<AJIsAwesome> Technically, yes.
<Jageman> Oh, mlp is scheduled to be canceled in 2016 though
<RoboGerbil> hmm it keeps reaking on me
*SpadeMagnes[R] slaps Jageman
<Meanwhile> reaking?
<Meanwhile> Streaking?
<Meanwhile> Why's it streaking on you?
<HoodyNinja> leaking?
<HoodyNinja> Whats leaking?
*Jageman rubs slap mark
<Jageman> owww
<RoboGerbil> you tell me, arent you the pro streaker?
<Jageman> SpadeMagnes[R]: what was that for?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> NocturnalBlade, GIMME. NOW.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So where exactly are all these Pinkies going?
<Jageman> SpadeMagnes[R]: I came back in time to warn you, and you slap me.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> SpadeMagnes[R], to the fourth wall?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So is Tom the permament guardian of the mirror pool now?
<NocturnalBlade> AssaultWithEmbraces: how do i do that XD
<Jageman> Its true. I invented a time machine in 2015 to come back and warn everyone that mlp is scheduled to be canceled in 2016 though
<AssaultWithEmbraces> NocturnalBlade, we have this thing called e-mail
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I suggest you look into it
<NocturnalBlade> ...-_(\
<AdamTheDuck> 1000 Pinkies...
<AdamTheDuck> Here I go...

<HoodyNinja> AssaultWithEmbraces: It already did
<Jageman> I am vengence, I am the night, I am JAGEMAN.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> AdamTheDuck: Has it worked?
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: did u died?
*HoodyNinja steals Jageman's J
<Jageman> hey
<AdamTheDuck> Only took ~35% of my gpu .-.
<HoodyNinja> I died but I'm alright
<AdamTheDuck> But it the Pinkies lagged like crazy
<AdamTheDuck> everything else was running fine
<SpadeMagnes[R]> AdamTheDuck: Pics or didnt happen
*Jageman chases HoodyNinja
*HoodyNinja deadrings away
<Jageman> Anyone got a spare J?
<Jageman> Hoody took mine
<Jageman> Forget it, ill just buy a new one. later
<Brad_> maybe it requires more tape.
<Kimori> restart it?
<twilight_sprinkle> then take his, Jageman
*SpadeMagnes[R] givs Jageman a J
<twilight_sprinkle> not many people with Js here
<AdamTheDuck> Excuse my slow Australian internet... ._.
<Stormy`> Shut up Brad_ :P
<Brad_> :P
<Stormy`> Yeah, I'm probably going to restart eventually
<HoodyNinja> Is doing an austrailian accent racist? Because now I feel racist
<AdamTheDuck> HoodyNinja, depends on what you view "Australian" to be
<Stormy`> I usually just have to do a system restore when it does this though because that doesn't fix it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Gday mate?
<AdamTheDuck> Because only 10% of us speak with a broad sociolect .-.
<HoodyNinja> Talking like the guy from the outback commercials
<Meanwhile> Croikey mate dingoes mate dingoes don't let your baby near a dingo mate it'll eat yer baby mate croikey.
<RaveBrony> Huh... Well this was ingame mid-fight crash xD
<HoodyNinja> "Shrimp on the barbie!"
<Meanwhile> That's how I speak australian.
<Brad_> I hate restarting.
<RoboGerbil> hmm i put 1000 pinkies on my puter and only hit 30% cpu usage
<Meanwhile> Or I wave a can of Fosters around.

<Hypercynder> also Ignitus
<poopsammich> NocturnalBlade: haha.. is that for me being on a pony site in general or jsut for this site?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> There's a Pinkie bouncing around on my computer
<Hypercynder> but I am not the creator of the legend of spyro
<wipergone2> lol
<wipergone2> how many
<poopsammich> that's actually a virus disguised as a pony
<haseo348> so...whats the point of this game to bulid a rocket and fly to the moon?
<wipergone2> or is it discord
<HoodyNinja> poopsammich: SHHHH
<NocturnalBlade> poopsammich: i think when new guys come here we link them that...also you might want to change your name, just in case :)
<HoodyNinja> Don't tell anyone
<wipergone2> YAY
<HoodyNinja> Get that bitch a rocket
<HoodyNinja> Bitches love rockets
<poopsammich> NocturnalBlade: Is my name really that innapropriate?

<Afflict[phone]> I'm off to bed. night everyone
<haseo348> poop
<Phase4> 00,02now
<Meanwhile> That looks like something Orks'd use to crack bunkers.
<Phase4> 00,02this should clear the tower
<Hypercynder> :)
<Moopy> I think that MoonBase Alpha is a funny game
<Phase4> 00,02hopefully
<Jmo> Crush sum oomies
<Meanwhile> Lmao.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Phase4, is this the part that we get to see the splosions?
<Phase4> 00,02it has some minor sturctural issues
<Meanwhile> It exploded.
<Meanwhile> You call that minor?
<wipergone2> ded
<NocturnalBlade> idk, thats just my opinion poopsammich lol if they havent got ya for it then i guess not :$
<HoodyNinja> I do
<poopsammich> moonbase is great when people dont spam JOHN MADDEN JOHN MADDEN JOHN MADDEN
<twilight_sprinkle> AssaultWithEmbraces: wuut ;~;
<haseo348> poopsammich: its not as innapropriate as someone who has the n word in their name but a name like that is childish...
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, you don't want to see a major one
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Oh I missed the splosions?
<Hypercynder> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt5MDbSddgw&feature=relmfu
<HoodyNinja> Major explosions hit you
<HoodyNinja> Through the game
<Moopy> Heh little midgets
<Meanwhile> "We have a minor problem in which half of the station personnel were vaporised in a giant fireball"
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Will Phase break physics today?
<HoodyNinja> Hopefully
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I want to see it.
<poopsammich> very well.....
<AssaultWithEmbraces> With my four eyes
<HoodyNinja> I'm too tired for this site
<Phase4> 00,02AssaultWithEmbraces, physics stands no chance
<Sp8ers> poopsammich is no more
<NocturnalBlade> is Phase4 pulling a Pinkie?
<Meanwhile> I think physics heard you Phase.
<NocturnalBlade> Welcome Sp8ers ^_^
<wipergone2> lol
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi Sp8ers
<Sp8ers> rocket's obviously need more fuel in order to maximize explosions
<Sp8ers> rockets*
<HoodyNinja> ^
<AdamTheDuck> ^^
<HoodyNinja> v
<AssaultWithEmbraces> >
<twilight_sprinkle> A B A B
<Sp8ers> <('.')>

<HoodyNinja> Damn I can't find the start button
<AssaultWithEmbraces> have a waffle: #
<Sp8ers> puppies can't fly!!!
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<twilight_sprinkle> haseo348: famous last words the puppy heard
<Sp8ers> sweet
<Phase4> 00,02i think the rocket is actually spawning inside the tower
<haseo348> lol
<Sp8ers> woaaaa...... bonus points for rocket pad destruction
<Meanwhile> Moar dakka.
<HoodyNinja> That splosion made my stream crash
<Phase4> 00,02Much better
<Sp8ers> just spawn a bunch of HL2 explosive barrels on that rocket and it should work.... works in garry's mod
<haseo348> HoodyNinja: what splosion? are you guys keeping something from me?
<HoodyNinja> TOO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<HoodyNinja> haseo348: You're adopted
<haseo348> HoodyNinja: OH NOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Phase4> 00,02problem physics?
<Sp8ers> GLADos: what's wrong with being adopted?
<haseo348> lol
<AssaultWithEmbraces> this is gonna go PERFECT
<Meanwhile> Physics appears to have heard you again.
<Sp8ers> IT'S WORKING!!!!

<haseo348> FLY FLY FLY!!!
<wipergone2> boom
<Sp8ers> TAKE THAT RUSSIA!!!!!
<haseo348> lol
<HoodyNinja> I think you invented a new artillery weapon
<RoboGerbil> needs moar explosions
<Sp8ers> where's the pilot?
<Sp8ers> oh no
<NocturnalBlade> rockets that become missles? very effective :D
<Phase4> 00,02-_-
<Sp8ers> save him!!
<Sp8ers> HURRY
<Meanwhile> Dead.
<Phase4> 00,02i tried
<wipergone2> ded
<Phase4> 00,02the parachute bugged out
<Phase4> 00,02otherwise he would have lived
<Sp8ers> he had a beautiful wife and 3 kids :'(
<AssaultWithEmbraces> He died a good Kerbal. NEXT!
<haseo348> the piliot had died...he was a hero...
<HoodyNinja> Nah he lived
<RoboGerbil> if it doesnt make a glowing crater its not big enough
<Meanwhile> You know Phase4 you really shouldn't mock physics mid-way. It never ends well.
<HoodyNinja> He's just hiding
<haseo348> SHHH trying to make people sad
<Sp8ers> It's ok... he was an unpaid intern
<haseo348> lol
<HoodyNinja> But thats no fun, Meanwhile
<Sp8ers> send the janitor next
<Meanwhile> You put unpaid interns at the helm of rocket ships?
<HoodyNinja> You gotta do it in the moment
<haseo348> no send one of the workers kids
<Sp8ers> in order to save money
<HoodyNinja> Use ducks
<Meanwhile> That sounds counter productive.
<haseo348> use tacos
<HoodyNinja> Ducks are smart as hell
<twilight_sprinkle> use AdamTheDucks
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Use marshmallows
<Sp8ers> yes
<Sp8ers> marshmellows r best
<haseo348> use pinkie pie
<Meanwhile> Just tape the switch on.
<HoodyNinja> Marshmallows are useless
<AdamTheDuck> Use me? .-.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Use NocturnalBlade
<HoodyNinja> Don't use AdamTheDuck, he has feelings too
<haseo348> ducks have feelings?
<Sp8ers> ok... this time, use duct tape instead of scotch tape for hull reinforcement
*AdamTheDuck is immune to this "feelings" .-.
<NocturnalBlade> for what? i wasnt paying attention
<Meanwhile> That looks like it's designed to drill to the core of a planet then explode.
<haseo348> FL
<Sp8ers> looks like it's designed to waste all unrenewable feul sorces
<Sp8ers> fuel*
<Meanwhile> Looks like...it's toast.
<Sylandest> its still going
<haseo348> uh-oh....GOTTA BOUNCE
<Sylandest> lol

<AssaultWithEmbraces> Gaaah
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Does Skype seem to be freezing or not responding for anyone a lot these days?
<Sumica> 00,10you know at that shallow an entry angle it should bounce off the atmosphear
<Jmo> Nope
<Phase4> home safely :3
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, at those speeds probably not
<aniderp> i get messages late on skype sometimes.. that count?
<NocturnalBlade> AssaultWithEmbraces: a couple of times...why?
<Kurra> Open chute....
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Skype seems to dislike me. That's why I use it on my phone whenever I can.
<Sumica> 00,10you meen at orbital speeds?
<Kurra> less than 4km....
<Kurra> 3km...
<NocturnalBlade> AssaultWithEmbraces: ah
<Kurra> 2km...
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, bout 3.6km/s when hitting the atmosphere
<Kurra> 1km... o.o;
<Kurra> Whew.
<Sumica> 00,10oh right I need to try KPS now that I have enough ram to support ships that I build
<aniderp> now its all blank.. my tools not doing anything..
<aniderp> not drawings.. i want to draw on paintchat
<RawketLawnchair> Oooh, Bastion.
<RawketLawnchair> Bastion is good.
<Sumica> 00,10mind you I should say "ships"
<Sumica> 00,10cause realy they are more like ICBM's
<Sumica> 00,10ever get warp couplers to work Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, icbm is best ship
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i did, but they dont work the way i want them to
<taoumi> i only heard borderlands when i hear this song
<Phase4> 00,02plus i suck at orbital randevus
<Phase4> 00,02i cannot spell french words
<Sumica> 00,10ahh
<oni_link> rendezvous or somthing tricky like that
<Sumica> 00,10like I am one to call some one else out on spelling
<Phase4> 00,02could try for an eve flight again
<Phase4> 00,02this should be capable of it
<Sumica> 00,10I was bummed out the game cant handle attaching things on two points
<Phase4> 00,02i wish the mirroring had more options
<Sumica> 00,10so I cant realy build the tug type chassie that I want
<Phase4> 00,02would like to attach even more rockets but i cant mirror two onto 6
<DeathStar> did someone m+ in here or are just you two talking...
<taoumi> nope it's jsut hem talking
<Sumica> 00,10bleeeh guess i need to get 17.1
<DeathStar> @_@ so many colours
<Sumica> 00,10hard to belive it was only 13 when we started playing
<taoumi> blue bluegreen
<Sumica> 00,107,8 this better?
<Phase4> 00,02i've got to get a copy of 0.15
<taoumi> Sumica: no
<DeathStar> Sumica: yes
<Phase4> 00,02want to fly tri again
<Phase4> 00,02tri was a good rocket
<DeathStar> Sumica: you should use those colours all the time!
<Sumica> 00,10I still remember every one doubting the ToP
<Jmo> .-.
<Sumica> 00,10that thing will never fly
<RawketLawnchair> More thrusters!
<Sumica> 00,10and then I broke solar orbit with it
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02ikr
<Phase4> 00,02that was another good rocket
<DeathStar> Sumica: you showed them!
<Shockolate> what is the game playing in the live stream?
<Sumica> 00,10it was insane
<Sumica> 00,10Kerbal space program
<Phase4> 00,02what the hay, lets try launch from here
<Shockolate> ok ty
<Sumica> 00,10wow
<Sumica> 00,10so many couplers
<Phase4> 00,02it explodes if i dont have them
<DeathStar> good night everybody ^_^ have fun
<Sumica> 00,10well yeah it's half off the pad
<Phase4> 00,02bout 1K tonns
<Phase4> 00,02on launch
<Jmo> Night Star
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight DeathStar
<Sumica> 00,10all that fule to put one guy in space
<Phase4> 00,02yup
*DeathStar dances off to bed
<Sumica> 00,10cross feed fuel?
<Phase4> 00,02and hopefully get him back
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, yeah, drains in a wierd circular patern
<taoumi> go justice
<taoumi> i haven't listend to them in a while
<Phase4> 00,02bit more efficent than dropping the entire outer stage
<Sumica> 00,10that the mecha Jeb?
<Sumica> 00,10on the left?
<Phase4> 00,02havent even broken atmosphere and already used 400 tonns of fuel
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, yeah
<Sumica> 00,10Top was like that too though
<Phase4> 00,02this rocket goes up
<Phase4> 00,02far as i know thats all its capable of
<NocturnalBlade> nite deathstar
<Sumica> 00,10only did like 40 Mp/s
<Phase4> 00,02this seperating is a bit risky
<Phase4> 00,02i've had this explode more than once
<Sumica> 00,10should use sep boosters
<Phase4> 00,02exaust causes problems
<Phase4> 00,02seems to be going up nicely
<Sumica> 00,10I need to see if I can get my TSO files to play
<Sumica> 00,10it's almost christmas and I want good cristmass music
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, tiberium symphony orchestra?

<Sumica> 00,10Same here
<Phase4> 00,02my center stage has legged it
<Sumica> 00,10but it's some crazy nonstandared file time
<Sumica> 00,10so I have to put a plugin to my winamp
<Phase4> 00,02well that is anoying
<Phase4> 00,02this rocket was all set to make it to eve
<Phase4> 00,02and then it broke
<Phase4> 00,02one more launch
<Phase4> 00,02if i cant make this one work then i'll either stop streaming or do something else
<Phase4> 00,02where'd everyone go?

<Jmo> >..
<Jmo> >.>
<Sumica> 00,10oh wait.
<Gold_Gemona> I recognized the song from the soundtrack, but I didn't think that's what you were playing!
<Sumica> 00,10I see the patcher is not a smart program
<Sumica> 00,10it has to be actaly be unziped to the folder
<Gold_Gemona> That's awesome!
<Gold_Gemona> Doing KSP patcher, sumi?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<MadSurge> :D I c what u did thar Gold_Gemona

<Phase4> 00,02i'm going to be reading documentation while ksp does stuff
<Sumica> 00,10if you have had enough
<Phase4> 00,02not particuarly interesting
<Gold_Gemona> The only thing that disappointed me about the Digmon movie was that it was actually three specials that were smashed together to make one loosely-related narrative.
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Gemona, ikr!
<Sumica> 00,10yeah I will set up
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, k, bug me when you're ready

<Gold_Gemona> Hey, Digimon!~ Hey, Digimon!~
<MadSurge> :|
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Gemona, i used to be really confused by the opening
<Phase4> 00,02what they were saying and what was happening seemd to have no relation
<Phase4> 00,02was cool to watch the subbed japanese version and see why
<Gold_Gemona> yeah
<Phase4> 00,02wonder why these 3 songs ended up in a row
<Phase4> 00,02o i c
<Gold_Gemona> I knew when I watched it that they'd added a LOT of unnecessary narration.
<Scootaloo35> What happens here now?
*Gold_Gemona sings along with the music like a dork
<Gold_Gemona> All my nostalgia, don't mind me. :P
<Sumica> 00,10ok Phase4

<Phase4> 00,02ohai SafariMonkey
<Gold_Gemona> There's no way to change the priorities? O_o
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, dwarf fortress allowed you to designate dwarfs to tasks, doesnt this game have an equivilent?
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Gemona: i have seen you in ages
<Gold_Gemona> ohai therainbowvortex :D
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, really needs some way to force tasks
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Gemona: hmm somthing is diferent
<Phase4> 00,02the invisible pidgeon who pushes the buttons
<AdamTheDuck> Well depends, was he generally taller than you?

<Gold_Demona> P:
<AdamTheDuck> therainbowvortex, Well depends, was he generally taller than you?
<Phase4> 00,02did wonder why it was green, normally your nick is red but the typo was green
<AdamTheDuck> or similar height?
<Mutterguy> I think Dorfs are smarter. In Urist we trust!
<SafariMonkey> Gold_Demona: People use intentional mutations of their names on here all the time
<Phase4> 00,02cows cows cows cows cows cows
<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck: yeah like a bit smaller then double my hight
<Mutterguy> You can't task individuals with jobs? that seems silly...
<SafariMonkey> Phase4: Nick-seeded colours? :D
<Phase4> 00,02SafariMonkey, yeah
<Gold_Demona> It's pretty sad to typo your own name and not notice until somebody points it out. :P

<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back MadSurge
<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck: reall i was screwed
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: aww no more Gemona
<Mutterguy> Because Mr urist the butcher butchers the god damn cow. It's his job. So long as he isn't being chased by goblins or boozing it up in the Hall
<AdamTheDuck> therainbowvortex, don't think that
<Phase4> 00,02to be fair if they were smart your job would be pointless
<AdamTheDuck> therainbowvortex, you think that, and you already lost the fight.
<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck: their was no way i could of bet him if he wanted to he could pick me up and trow me acroos the room
<Phase4> 00,02micro managing with a macro managing interface is anoying yeah

*SafariMonkey is thoroughly confused, due to stream being filtered in school
<Gold_Demona> "Have at the, Monster! I shall punch you with my wood! That's why they call me Punchwood!"
<AdamTheDuck> SafariMonkey, go back to your edumaction :P
<Mutterguy> Sumica if you dig a hole into the 6th floor... why not drown the 7th floor?

<Mutterguy> it's calledtowns. pretty much a Dwarf Fortress knock off
<MadSurge> Hello pony_5586! Are you new?
<Gold_Demona> Go home cow. You're drunk.
<pony_5586> yeah
<MadSurge> pony_5586: have you read the rules?
<[KOR]Cocoa> How nice game it is!
<pony_5586> of course
<Mutterguy> well at least they don't run mushroom beer...
<Mutterguy> *run on
<MadSurge> pony_5586: then welcome! You might want to pick a less generic name now
<pony_5586> ?
<pony_5586> oh

<Gold_Demona> He had to get that one special cow. >_>
<[KOR]Cocoa> Is this 2D or 3D?
<Gold_Demona> It was THE cow! The most important cow in the whole wide world! D:
<Gold_Demona> No other cows will do!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: COW LAUNCHED
<Gold_Demona> How many bones could a Towns man throw if a Towns man go chuck bones?
<Mutterguy> Sumica I think they've coded a dwarf's anatomy with object oriented language. Your dwarf can specifically die from a bleeding liver
<MadSurge> I don't even know what a wood chuck is :s
<JRP2234> Phase4 sleep
<Phase4> 00,02streams derping here, probably the microwave
<Phase4> 00,02REALLY need to get my wireless card swapped out
<MadSurge> Microwaves, HOW DO THEY WORK
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: A woodchuck kinda looks like a gopher. :P
<MadSurge> Aaaah
<MadSurge> So it's a rodent?
<Mutterguy> Carve them and sell them. Bone crafts are best trinkets.
<Phase4> 00,02combat badgers?
<Gold_Demona> As we lie if Field of Bone!~

<Phase4> 00,02Mutterguy, i'd probably drink myself to death if i had to see twilight
<Mutterguy> I don't blame him
<[KOR]Cocoa> This game looks minecraft!
<Phase4> 00,02[KOR]Cocoa, actually looks more like transport tycoon to me
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, might have to remove that stone wall
<Phase4> 00,02they're confuz
<TrixieMuffins> is there an ultimate goal to this game ?
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, south of the corner
<MadSurge> Don't think so TrixieMuffins
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, i have no idea why they're doing that either
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Boast Busters Anniversary Day!
<Gold_Demona> lol A Sethisto post all about Trixie. Who's shocked? :D
<MadSurge> Anniversary for Boast Busters?! NO, forget that episode! Burn it!
<MadSurge> Trixie is worst pony
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: No. Diamond Tiara is worst pony
<Phase4> 00,02too bad you cant build paths
<Phase4> 00,02some kind of hint to the ai would be nice
<MadSurge> But Diamond Tiara isn't treated like "nuuuu she's god she's just mizundrestud" Gold_Demona :(
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: This is true. I'd say that makes Trixie most overrated pony, not worst.
<MadSurge> I guess you're right
<JRP2234> ...

<Blaze666> Enoeyup
<MadSurge> Alchemist: Big Mac is the strongest, but he fears his sister's anger
<Alchemist> MadSurge: and I bet he should
<MadSurge> Alchemist: angry women are scary
<Gold_Demona> Especially women as strong as AJ

<Alchemist> It's no fun to go alone! Here, take this! http://derpy.me/Iy0RC
<Alchemist> I found episode 3 quite amusing, dunno what you think.
<Gold_Demona> When RD brought that Pinkie in, all I could picture was a bunch of : ( on the ground where they left.
<Gold_Demona> :C
<RoboGerbil> http://images.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3360-1330671248679.gif
<MadSurge> Alchemist: it was amazing, I could not type on chat because I was too busy laughing :D
<RoboGerbil> whoops wrong post
<Gold_Demona> It's my favorite Pinkie-centered episode.
<SafariMonkey> Alchemist: Yep, pretty amusing. Nice to see another exploration of a classic scifi theme, like "it's about time"
<Blaze666> i think there shuld of been a simultanius pinkie sneze
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: even people who hate Pinkie liked it
<RoboGerbil> ugh i hate you sometimes derpy.me
<Alchemist> MadSurge: reading some comments on EqD I saw that many people are getting disillusioned (for lack of a better word), because they try to look too deep into the show...
<RoboGerbil> meh i guess you guys dont get to see fluttershy pics
<MadSurge> Alchemist: you have no idea of the discussion about Pinkie clones on the Round Stable... :D
<Alchemist> RoboGerbil: I saw the wingboner one :D

<Alchemist> *it
<MadSurge> Alchemist: still, most saw it for what it was, a fun episode :D

<aniderp> WHY
<CrystalPhoenix> IT'S STILL NOVEMBER
<aniderp> cant we save it for after thanksgiving?

<Alchemist> MadSurge: slapstick comedy with Pinkie is a great mix :)
<Gold_Demona> I've been hearing Christmas music since before Halloweed (stupid Walmart)
<Gold_Demona> Halloween*
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: enough religious festivities here, I'll skip the turkey thanks
<MadSurge> Alchemist: also, Pinkie is not a shallow fun hog
<aniderp> someone station on the bus plays christmas music so she agreed to let me have radio till after thanksgiving
<MadSurge> That was the best part for me
<Gold_Demona> Thanksgiving is second best holiday. Because FOOD!~
<Blaze666> i had someone with lights up and on at halloween
<aniderp> old person finally agrees with me
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Xmas and new year feasts :Q
<aniderp> i noticed..
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, are your villagers happy yet?
<aniderp> there are no thanksgiving songs D:
<Gold_Demona> We don't feast for New Years over here. Just lots and lots of alcahol.
<Alchemist> MadSurge: we already knew that, but I imagine sometimes its hard to write a good story for a certain character (like AJ).
<Gold_Demona> Booze everywhere
<aniderp> gold do i have to wait till im 21? ;_;
<CrystalPhoenix> wat is this?
<Alchemist> aniderp: not if you are from europe :)
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: we eat pork leg with lentils
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, can you build any entertainment?
<aniderp> im from america..
<Gold_Demona> Ew Lentils. ><
<aniderp> :\
<Phase4> 00,02seems like you should be able to do that
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also panettone, mmmmmmmmm
<aniderp> whiskey shot is nasty
<Phase4> 00,02build more!
<Phase4> 00,02we have the technology!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: but I like all kinds of beans
<aniderp> baked beans
<Alchemist> aniderp: dont some states have the 18 year limit? all have the 21 year old limit?
<Gold_Demona> I love whiskey. Especially with Coke, :>
<MadSurge> Ewww
<aniderp> speaking of.. i get some today!
<aniderp> baked beans
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: age 21 is federal law
<MadSurge> I can't take mixed flavours
<MadSurge> So chinese is horrible for me
<aniderp> i sipped whiskey shot before i shot it down..
<Alchemist> I like the "hunter" =poor quality red wine + coke.
<aniderp> stupid idea
<Phase4> 00,02they're not watching D:
<Gold_Demona> You're not supposed to "sip" liquor. =/
<Phase4> 00,02badgers are killing each other and no ones watching
<MadSurge> What are those things doing?!
<Mutterguy> Oh no Blue badger breifly bailed but now he back!
<Gold_Demona> You're supposed to rush it past your mouth and swallow it before you get the chance to taste it
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: what about beer?
<aniderp> i wanted to see the taste.. never sipping to tatse again
<Gold_Demona> Same with beer
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: The only alcoholic beverage that's for sipping is stuff like wine and champagne
<Alchemist> I only gulp down the ones I dont like. I like to taste the ones i like.
<Alchemist> Like Metaxa.
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: With things like liquor, the drink is for the aftertaste and affect. Not the flavor.
<aniderp> they were nice and gave me water
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: beats the purpose of drinks for me :| why drink something if it tastes like paint thinner
<aniderp> my mother dont know about that..
<Alchemist> Or metaxa with ginger soda
<aniderp> was shaking after
<Alchemist> MadSurge: to get drunk?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Not really. Things like schnapps taste better in the aftertaste than the actual taste.

<Alchemist> talking about shoes and alcohol; there is a custom here, I dont know if its universal.

<Gold_Demona> Toast in a boot? The only reason I know about it is because of Hetalia. :P

<Sumica> 00,10I would love to see an opera preformed to this
<Sumica> 00,10ZOMG lyrics!
<Gold_Demona> To be honest, I've never finished ff6, but it's still one of my favorites.
<Squallken> the floating contant
<Gold_Demona> Japanese lyrics, but lyrics nonetheless. :D
<RoboGerbil> how can it be your favorite if youve neevr beat it?
<Squallken> I can never get too that damn place
<Gold_Demona> RoboGerbil: I played it most of the way
<RoboGerbil> Gold_Demona: how you know, you never beat it

<RoboGerbil> well i know i never really got attached to any of the characters in ff6
<RoboGerbil> cuz every 10 mins theyd leave my party
<Gold_Demona> I love King Edgar. He's my favorite. :>
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Umaro is best berserker :D
<Gold_Demona> I never used Umaro because I don't like characters I can't control. :<
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I used him for the Fanatics Tower :)
<Sumica> 00,10sabin and gao shadow and the knight whos name I cant recall at 5am
<RoboGerbil> heh i used the feral kid with the monster powers a lot
<Gold_Demona> My main team usually consisted of Edgar, Terra, Mog, and Gogo.
<Gold_Demona> Or Sabin.
<RoboGerbil> i used the knight chick too
<MadSurge> Celes?
<RoboGerbil> yeh
<Gold_Demona> Celes is cool too. =)

<Sumica> 00,10kefka
<RoboGerbil> sephiroth was a dumb bad guy
<MadSurge> ^^^^^^^^^
<Blaze666> ^^^
<Gold_Demona> I like Sephiroth as a villain, but Kefka is WAY more nuts.
<RoboGerbil> he wasnt even really yhr bad guy either
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: too tranquil mad for my tastes :|
<Squallken> YES, people who pick Kefka :D
<Sumica> 00,10they are both good but in a comparason kefka
<Gold_Demona> And Kefka actually SUCCEEDED in destroying the world
<Sumica> 00,10it got better
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Kefka is a way better madman :D
<Gold_Demona> Hellz yeh
<Squallken> That and Septheroth cant "laugh"
<Sumica> 00,10well so did sephi
<Sumica> 00,10recall how fucked things got when he did that shit in the north
<RoboGerbil> ultamecia was best boss
<Gold_Demona> Also in Dissidia, who else is reminded of Mark Hammil Joker a little bit when Kefka talks?
<Gold_Demona> Kefka's laugh is best laugh.
<MadSurge> Prance walking is best walking
<Squallken> thats it im kefka's laugh for a ringtone
<Sumica> 00,10ok probably enough of this
<Squallken> im getting*
<Gold_Demona> But it was almost to the part where the guy and the girl sing together. :<

<RoboGerbil> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbq0z6eFgR1rpb34po1_500.png
<MadSurge> Oh wait
<Sumica> 00,107 was still fun
<MadSurge> Sumica: 8 though was bad
<Sumica> 00,10even if it gets more prase then games just as good
<Sumica> 00,10yeah 8 was bad
<Blaze666> ya sory for gat a ?
<Gold_Demona> 8 wasn't bad, but it was really boring. T^T
<Sumica> 00,10they did some cool stuff with it
<Squallken> it had a kick but twist with cloud's mind being made up from different memories, sending him unto a crisis, but sadly that genius gets over shadowed by Aerith dying :[
<Blaze666> forgot*
<RoboGerbil> wat? i liked ff8, 9 was bad
<Sumica> 00,10but I did not care for it
<Gold_Demona> I liked 9
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Seifer sucks so much he got owned by Gilgamesh
<Kandarihu> Oh, Final Fantasy 8?
<Gold_Demona> I'm also in that very rare minority that actually likes 10-2
<Sumica> 00,10realy thought what made the games good for me was the music
<Gold_Demona> ^
<Gold_Demona> Nobuo Uematsu is a music god
<MadSurge> Of course, music is important in a game
<Squallken> my favorite FF's (that ive beaten) are 4, 7, 8, and 10. FF's I want to beat is 3, and 6
<Blaze666> are*
<Squallken> thank you
<Squallken> are*
<Blaze666> np
<Sumica> 00,10she plays rather good
<Gold_Demona> I've only beaten 7, 9, and 10. But I've also played 5, 6, 8, and 12.
<RoboGerbil> i never beat 12 either it got so repetative
<Gold_Demona> 5 is good, but I always get bored grinding all the jobs. =/
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: aye
<Gold_Demona> 12 is boring as hell.
<Sumica> 00,10game play wise yeah
<Squallken> I've beaten 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12.
<Sumica> 00,10liked the story thought
<Squallken> I had fun with 12
<Gold_Demona> I couldn't get into 12's story, and the characters are very bland.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Gilgamesh and the general humour is what made 5 a good game for me :D
<Gold_Demona> The gameplay was alright. I kinda liked the fighting system in 12.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: get Final Fantasy Tactics games instead
<Squallken> I thought the characters to 12 were good, at least there conversations
<RoboGerbil> i beat both ff tactics
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: No. I HATE that chessboard battle system.
<MadSurge> :D
<RoboGerbil> but tactics advance is only good for 1 playthrough
<Sumica> 00,10I need to get back in to fft
<Sumica> 00,10did not care for the rules of tatics advance
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: it's not as bad as Disgaea, you don't really need to grind
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Never played Disgaea
<RoboGerbil> i never beat disgaea
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I just can't stand that chessboard system.
<MadSurge> Sumica: Tactics Advance 2 is MUCH more lenient with the ru;es system
<Gold_Demona> It's REALLY annoying.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I can see that
<Gold_Demona> I tried playing an FFT game once, and got REALLY annoyed at the "judgement" system
<RoboGerbil> it got to the point that i needed to grind 150 levels on each character just to advance the story a chapter
<Sumica> 00,10the VG cats comic sums it up for me
<Blaze666> woo VG cats
<MadSurge> Sumica: link?
<Sumica> 00,10http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=112
<RoboGerbil> but i liked the near limitless advancement of characters in disgaea
<RoboGerbil> la pucille tactics was a better game than disgaea
<MadSurge> YAAAAAY
<MadSurge> RoboGerbil: TOO limitless. The amount of grinding you need is terrible :|

<Blaze666> off to dubble my fun
<Lyra`> i wish it worked in revese, mare goes in, mare and stallion come out~
<Sumica> 00,10so was any one else like wtf with the hidden shelf in the libary?
<DerpyMuffins> I find it scary to see two Lyra` s running around
<naturesfury> later that day http://foxy-noxy.deviantart.com/art/Best-Day-Ever-338309538?ga_submit_new=10%253A1353203277
<Sylandest> Sumica: I was
<Lyra`> this chat can barely contain one
<MadSurge> naturesfury: :D
<Sumica> 00,10I cant help but think that is forshadowing
<MadSurge> Sumica: what?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Sumica: the world of equestria is more based around female culture. Due to their population being almost 80% female, they took prominance just as males have in human society. example, Best man, Best mare.
<Sylandest> Sumica: If I had to make a guess, I'd say it kept the legend of the pool hidden so nopony uses it like Pinkie did and make chaos as a result
<PonyBean> maybe gonna be used again for season finale?
<naturesfury> dem walls
<MadSurge> Sumica: Oh, that hidden book? Of course it totally is!
<Sumica> 00,10each ep seems to have a stand out wtf moment

<AttackWithHugs> Dat Mojay
<Sylandest> and then everything goes off
<Jmo> :3
*DoctoDoctorWho1 attacks AttackWithHugs with a hug
<Sumica> 00,10all this double double talk makes me want in & out

*AttackWithHugs huggles DoctoDoctorWho
<MadSurge> Squallken: maybe it doesn't work on him
<Sumica> 00,10so that's 13 pin kies
<MadSurge> Squallken: besides, I think he already can split himself :D
<Sylandest> Sumica: 13 precisely?
<SpeccyRush> about 15 sumi
<Squallken> I think the mirror pool has no limits on "fun"
<Sylandest> no, its 14
<Sylandest> *13
<Dark_Horst> i just counted 13
<Obsidian> Some probably stayed behind so more could multiply
<MadSurge> Why do they not show Pinkie's portrait though? :s
<PonyBean> forest is populated with pinkies?
<naturesfury> MadSurge: i was thinking that 2
<Sylandest> ok, there's definitely more than 13...
<Sumica> 00,10you know I get the feeling this ep came from an animater screwing around
<DoctoDoctorWho1> Who are the other two?
<Dark_Horst> the animators probably stopped counting here for mayhem'S sake
<Lyra`> i see applefritter
<Lyra`> but who is that stallion?
<MadSurge> Dat pinkie didn't budge a bit :D
<Sumica> 00,10more or less this is like my desktop the time I spauned 10 pinkies with desktopponies
<DoctoDoctorWho1> And the stallion?
<SpeccyRush> and Meadow Song
<MadSurge> Sumica: :D
<Lyra`> should i stay Lyra`, or go to BlackWidow?
<Dark_Horst> and we probably just sw derpy'S backside
<Sylandest> Sumica: did you notice there were two Doctor Whooves in that shot a moment ago?
<Sylandest> *or Time Turner
<naturesfury> is this a reference to something?
<naturesfury> when he did the door thing
<MadSurge> Foreshadowiiiiing~
<DoctoDoctorWho1> No, has to be another apple
<Dark_Horst> Sylandest: wouldnt be the first time he saw himself
<Sylandest> Dark_Horst: fair point, hehe
<Dark_Horst> but i get the feeling it was just the usual crows cloning
<Dark_Horst> *crowd
<Punkie_Pue> The Pinkie is a spy!
<MadSurge> Amish jokes :D
<Alchemist> I am Spartacus
<MadSurge> ^

<Dark_Horst> RoboGerbil: that's some serious fun
<MadSurge> RoboGerbil: YES :D
<DoctoDoctorWho1> MadSurge: possibly
<naturesfury> need to make all 1000 say fun at the same time 2
<Sumica> 00,10bet it would be easy to add the "
<Sumica> 00,10Bet it would be easy to add the "fun" sound file to pinkie
<MadSurge> Real Pinkie is a full fledged character <3
<Obsidian> Ohi Tank
<DoctoDoctorWho1> Pinkiepocalypse
<Squallken> for a while I thought the clones were saying "mine"
<PonyBean> pinkie abuse! D:
<Punkie_Pue> I loved that part! <3
<Kandarihu> You know what? I have another theory about this episode. Some of the Pinkie clones might have escaped.
<Alchemist> Take this Pinkeh!
<naturesfury> splat
<MadSurge> Andrea must have had so much fun recording this episode :D
<MadSurge> YAAAAAY
<DerpyMuffins> A fanfic reference
<Alchemist> and a new meme was born

<RaveBrony> I would really like to try and bomb the Machine Transporter thingy
<Kandarihu> RaveBrony, where you're invading Grey's turf and trying to drop a bomb in it?
<RaveBrony> Yeah, lol
<Alchemist> How come there is Pinkie in most SFMs but not the rest of the mane6?
<AJIsAwesome> I'm guessing because Pinkie's usually a fan favorite?
<PaRappaTheRapper> Alchemist you are right.
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<PaRappaTheRapper> rayman ftw

<Wrek> 05mroe than you think DerpyMuffins
<DerpyMuffins> A strike?
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome, in the wee hours of the morning? ...Okay, it would probably be daylight in his timezone
<Chrysalis> this is also an annoying fact of MvM
<Everlasting_Joy> This is so true.
<Chrysalis> if your an engineer and your halfway decent
<Chrysalis> everyone will get pissed off at all the sentry busters
<Kandarihu> That's a funny handle: Dr Face

<Eli> AJIsAwesome: i'm not afraid of it. but it causes me light headaches
<Buytoast> G-mod is good for obscure and absurd shit
<AJIsAwesome> Ah.
<Buytoast> SFM is more for semi serious shit
<Spamish> SFM is so hard to use, but give good results
<Buytoast> like you wouldn't want to really make something like a giant spearheaded multi headed medic gun in SFM
<Buytoast> it'd look wierd
<AJIsAwesome> Sasha is best pony.
<Buytoast> but that shit would probably fly in g-mod
<AJIsAwesome> I wonder how Heavy got stuck in the walll in the first place....
<Lil_B> AJIsAwesome hangovers man... everything's possible
