<Alchemist> It would be a nice touch if we would get to know how some of the mane6 met with each other. All we know right now is that RD and FS knew each other since they ere little and thats it.
<Lewis_Jenkins> Hey there. ^_^
<ekips> ohai Lewis_Jenkins
<Meanwhile> Allo Lewis_Jenkins
<Kammerjunk> Alchemist: That's so not true. We know that Twi' met all of them at the Summer Sun Celebration.

<FillyFlam> Alchemist: I think they at least had a vague awareness of each other.
<Dken2021> Alchemist sounds like a nice episode
<Vordox> Zecora best Zebra...wait what

<Vordox> WORD OF THE DAY
<Vordox> A Pyrrhic victory (/ˈpɪrɪk/) is a victory with such a devastating cost that it carries the implication that another such victory will ultimately lead to defeat. Someone who wins a "Pyrrhic victory" has been victorious in some way; however, the heavy toll and/or the detrimental consequences negates any sense of achievement or profit. There is, therefore, no reason to celebrate.
<GilDash> Vordox: Well, we'll see how true that is when I'm having a slow day then.
<MASF123> GO!!!
<MASF123> KABOOM!
<alexxm> Vordox any idea how that phrase came about

<Nick> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Nick, you are a 10Grimer.
<Braviary> Prince-dari, you seem immature.

*prince-dari pins the "No shit Sherlock" medal on Braviary

<Vinyer> i liked grimer more
<CriticKitten> So don't hate, enjoy it. Because so long as America has its overpatriotic psychos, you keep getting humor out of us.
<CriticKitten> :D
<MASF123> Haha ^_^
<Braviary> I'm an overpatriotic psycho, and I still find humor in America bashing.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13EW GRIMER
<Angel_Umbreon> 13GTFO
<Braviary> And Glenn Beck had his show cancelled from FOX News earlier this year.
<twilight_sprinkle> every country has overpatriotic psychos
<CriticKitten> How else are you gonna get a superhero whose initial creation featured him decking Hitler IN THE FACE.
<twilight_sprinkle> the country with the most overpatriotic psychos is serbia
<twilight_sprinkle> that place is insane

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> prince-dari: movies are getting stupider and stupider... who makes a movie about lincoln killing vampires
<Braviary> Hitler killed Jews.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I'm breathing into my hand and it's making funny noises and I'm amusing myself with it .w.
<prince-dari> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: Clearly Americans
<prince-dari> :P
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> prince-dari: MURICA
<MASF123> Yes he is a bad person, but the man had skills.
<Braviary> The same people who made a map for Black Ops featuring Kennedy and Nixon teaming up with Castro to kill zombies.
<CriticKitten> AW SHIT AMERICA
<Barbetos|AtWork> Whoa server lag
<Vordox> Hitler was one of the best things that could happen to Germany at that time.
<Vordox> The follow up however...
<prince-dari> Well not really
<Braviary> Kennedy was also charismatic, but people complain about him wanting to start Vietnam.
<MASF123> Nazis were only trying to purify the world.
<CriticKitten> Also, you think the Ab Lincoln vs vampires movie is bad?
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: not really, germans were terrorized as well
<Vordox> If he had not turned against Russia...We all would speak German.
<prince-dari> Hitler landed Germany in the shit
<CriticKitten> Look at the Asylum ripoff of that film instead.
<Vordox> prince-dari: But he built up the shit. :P
<CriticKitten> Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies.
<twilight_sprinkle> well, terrorized is a bad term, i meant oppressed
<MASF123> Asylum. Lol. They make movie mock-ups.
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Opressed or not, he did save the land, but the way he saved it caused a huge rift.
<CriticKitten> Asylum makes the best worst movies.
<alexxm> i actually have a book called queen victoria demon hunter
<Vordox> Check out the political party and the howabout of the German Economy.
<CriticKitten> MegaPirahna. :3
<Braviary> Do you know what I want to see? I want to see Lyndon Johnson protrayed as a serial rapist.
<Alchemist> going to get some sleep. bye al.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: you mean before the war?
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Indeed.
<alexxm> bye Alchemist
<diddutz> CriticKitten: so true :3
<MASF123> $10,000 budget is all they need to make a great terrible movie mock-up.
<prince-dari> To be honest Vordox, the reason the German economy was so bad was because of the first war
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: People were seriously panicing and being opressed. and then hitler came there and took over.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: well, i dont remember what germanys condition was before the war
<Vordox> prince-dari: Yes.
<diddutz> snakes on a train, fucking hilarious ^^
<prince-dari> So getting Hitler and another war didn't really help
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Pretty shit. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: well, people were still panicking and opressed during hitler
<Braviary> War makes the economy go BOOM.
<MASF123> Aliens v.s. Hunters. WTF.
<Vordox> prince-dari: Never said he "saved" it, but he repaired it, but the cost of it...
<twilight_sprinkle> war also makes people go boom
<CriticKitten> diddutz: Ha, haven't seen that one, but now I want to run out and hunt it down.
<diddutz> prince-dari: well it would if they had won...
<prince-dari> Braviary: DO HO HO
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good afternoon everyone
<MASF123> DISMISSED!
<Vordox> Braviary: Sad truth, check USA.
<Braviary> It wasn't the war that made Germany weak, it was the treaty that fucked Germany up the ass, to pardon my language.
<prince-dari> Well yeah, but that was a direct result of the war
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<MASF123> RAINBOW!
<Braviary> If they had won the war it wouldn't have happened.
<Braviary> Wait a minute.
<twilight_sprinkle> the treaty is a result of loss of war, so thats nothing surprising
<twilight_sprinkle> Braviary: they shouldve never started a war
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Nonsense. According to Fox News, the economy is totally in the shitter because of Obama! Not because of the two massive wars started prior to his inauguration that are costing us about a trillion dollars per year!
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: lol fox news
<Braviary> Imperialism is important for a country's growth.
<Ray> 02Got to go :<
<MASF123> GO!
<Ray> 02Nini everyone~
<prince-dari> According to Fox news the UK is turning into the UKKK
<prince-dari> Because of racist Nazi babies
<prince-dari> Tru fax
<twilight_sprinkle> according to fox news bronies are babymen
<CriticKitten> Also, Fox News seems to have trouble creating graphs.
<Nick> night ray
<CriticKitten> And they seem to have confused Russia with Greece.
<MASF123> Nazi babies??? :S
<GilDash> prince-dari: Oh are we? You might want to tell Saturn his convention name needs changing. :D
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> prince-dari according to fox news the are grown men who like my little pony, can you belive it ?
<twilight_sprinkle> Braviary: imperialism isnt a correct way to grow
<Vordox> CriticKitten: And HOW can you still be standing IF the two wars are NOT sponsored by the PResident?
<Braviary> FOX News as a whole isn't that bad, it's just select commentators that everyone makes fun of.
<Sumica> 00,10Dont you meen Faux news Dari?
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Cause and reactions
<Angel_Umbreon> 13Goodnight Ray :D
<Vordox> SUMICA
<prince-dari> XD
<Vordox> FINALLY!
<alexxm> according to fox news anonymous can blow up trucks
<Vordox> To Skype!
<Braviary> They probably could.
*Ray sleeps on Angel's Head
<alexxm> hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT hows yoru day been
<MASF123> Weren't Fox News the same people that got all the info wrong about the bronies?
<Meanwhile> Fox 'News'
<CriticKitten> And they have trouble figuring out that palm trees don't appear in cities in the east coast....you know what, let's just say Fox News has trouble being factually accurate.
<Braviary> If the truck had a GPS, you could hack the truck, control it, overheat the engine.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> alexxm aside from a headache, it's been good, and yours ?
<Braviary> Even if you couldn't explode it, you could crash it.
<Meanwhile> 4chan is more politically correct than Fox News is.
<alexxm> i've been good TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<kirzstryfe> 8,6gonna set up for some music requests and be back in just a minute
<Braviary> FOX is closer to the center as a whole than MSNBC.
<prince-dari> Since stream's down, this is the clip of evil racist babies
<CriticKitten> I do enjoy listening to Fox occasionally, though. It's quite amusing.
<prince-dari> It's only 1 minute 30
<CriticKitten> XD
<FairysHuff> Anyone care for a game of something? I'm bored n lonely. LOVE ME! >_<
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: Ikr o__o
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: got serious sam 1?
<CriticKitten> Braviary: Hardly. They're both on the opposite ends of the idiot spectrum.
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: like both non HD versions?
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: No I'm not much of an fps player
<Braviary> Prince-dari, that was hilarious.
<CriticKitten> The only difference is that MSNBC is rather sad, and Fox is rather hilarious.
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: Slow reactions.
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: Oh :D you don't need that with serious sam really
<GilDash> prince-dari: Thanks for sharing that. :D
<Braviary> Alright, I have to go. America is great, kill the terrorists!
<prince-dari> Everyone loves a bit of Russell Howard. :P
<Viri> 14aw, missed him D:
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: I prefer trun based strategy or RPGs like IceWind Dale
<twilight_sprinkle> meh.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hem
<twilight_sprinkle> ehm.
<CriticKitten> Besides, Fox has singlehandedly produced more, and better, memes. Like Megyn Kelly or Bill O'Reilly. :3
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: I'm a all round gamer i may not like just a few genres but else i can play most games
<alexxm> http://derpy.me/CZZYx for some reason this picture makes me laugh
<killerpony7733> alexxm: thats cute
<alexxm> i know killerpony7733
<Big_Macintosh_1992> hello bronystate!
<killerpony7733> Big_Macintosh_1992: Oi
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: I loathe racing games. Never understood peoples love of them. Yeh lets go round and round in a circle. WOO! ^_^ heh
<GilDash> prince-dari: I say we need more Russel Howard's good news and Mock the Week here on Bronystate. :)
<CriticKitten> I don't get racing in general.
<alexxm> hey Bug_Macintosh_1992 hows your day been
<Barbetos|AtWork> alexxm all I could think was "Hug the Giraffe." followed by "Wow. That sounds like something some one would say to indicate the kind of trip they are on."
<prince-dari> People all watch racing for one reason, and one reason only
<FairysHuff> CriticKitten: Same
<prince-dari> Crashes
<MASF123> It's Russell Crow's fightin' tour, fightin' round the wurld.
<prince-dari> XD
<Big_Macintosh_1992> alexxm: lol... bug mac
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: alot of games with that solved how boring it was with guns and stuff
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> my head hurtsss, and this chat is deaaaaaad :p
<Big_Macintosh_1992> alexxm: been good
<twilight_sprinkle> crashes are too painful to watch for me personally o.o
<Viri> 14anyway, I'm going to bed too
<Barbetos|AtWork> prince-dari I watch it for the beer and left turns.
<CriticKitten> I have a very Jeff Dunham approach to racing: "Oh they're making a left turn!" "Oh they're making another left turn!" "Oh they're making another left turn!" "I wonder what'll happen next!"
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<FairysHuff> But then again I feel the same about any team sport.
<alexxm> Big_Macintosh_1992 i derped
<Viri> 14tomorrow I will be missing most of the day
<derp_derp> hai hai
<Viri> 14good night everyone :3
<Big_Macintosh_1992> alexxm: 's ok
<Nyanners> ._.
<prince-dari> I dunno, F1 has some pretty good crashes
<alexxm> the way i see it you play one racing game you've played them all
<killerpony7733> Oh dat RD image
<Barbetos|AtWork> suddenly rd and music
<alexxm> hey derp_derp hows your day been
<FairysHuff> "Oh the ball is going down the field, now it's going up, no down, no up." for a freaking hour. >_<
<MASF123> WELCOME to the Circus of Values! Ah hahahahaha!!! >:D
<Petrified_Discord> Hiya everypony :)
<kirzstryfe> 8,6ok, going to be taking some music requests in #Vinyl_Scratch, keep the requests clean though, music only
<Big_Macintosh_1992> hello Petrified_Discord
<MadSurge> Ohai Petrified_Discord!
<alexxm> hey Petrified_Discord hows your day been
<pony_756593> Crud
<CriticKitten> FairysHuff: I get that way with soccer. Not enough scoring or excitement for me. I can enjoy American Football because exciting stuff seems to be happening on a more regular basis.
<Petrified_Discord> Good, good :)
<pony_756593> How do you change your nickname again?
<CriticKitten> Or rugby.
<FairysHuff> kirzstryfe: How about some instrumental music relaxing.
<FairysHuff> CriticKitten: They are all the same to me.
<pony_756593> Thank...... The 11th doctor is real!
<kirzstryfe> 8,6this chat is always dead :p
<alexxm> nice luna remix
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> god i forgot what this song was called
<prince-dari> I tried watching American football once
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> nvm
<prince-dari> They played for 2 minutes, then stopped for 5 minutes to comment on the 2 minutes.
<adasdad> discord metal remix?
<prince-dari> Then played for 2 minutes again.
*Big_Macintosh_1992 sings along to discord
<Brony_With_Pride> XD
<CriticKitten> Hm, let's see if I can draw Nittany out of hiding. EA IS THE BEST COMPANY EVER.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey kirzstryfe what is the name of this song/mix ?
<Brony_With_Pride> Using the ponychat while in school
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> prince-dari: =/ MURICA
<prince-dari> It's kind of annoying to be honest.
<Brony_With_Pride> Still not yet caught yet
<LordCelestia> 0,5MURRIKA
<prince-dari> Rugby has a lot more action IMO
<MadSurge> Aw shit, AMERICA!
<CriticKitten> Dari: Probably watching the last few minutes of the game, then. Those are really slow.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> its very easy to bring nittany out of hiding
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Brony_With_Pride: high school?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6this is the Brony Metal Medley
<prince-dari> I dunno, I think it was some superbowl thing.
<CriticKitten> The earlier portions of the game are usually a bit better paced.
<alexxm> i think this is metal remixes of a bunch of pony songs
<MadSurge> kirzstryfe: fuck yeah, metal ponies!
<kirzstryfe> 8,6brony metal medley, from bronyfied
<CriticKitten> But near the end, they take HUGE pauses between each play because everyone's trying to drag out the remaining clock time.
<Jim> woop
<kirzstryfe> 8,6just realized how low my sound was
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Jim: nice simple name
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> kirzstyfe
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kk thanks :p
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> woops
<Jim> Why be complex when you can be easy
<Jim> wait, that came out wrong
<FairysHuff> Or the world could stop playing team sports and paying players millions to kick a ball and actually contribute to society. But thats my opinion.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> lol
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Jim: haha
<MadSurge> FairysHuff: or give them a bit less money at least :D
<MASF123> FairysHuff, I never thought about that. Lol.
<FairysHuff> MadSurge: If anything the should be payed minimum wage at most.
<FairysHuff> *they
<Big_Macintosh_1992> MadSurge: but if you pay them less, they all quit and you end up with FairysHuff's idea
<Big_Macintosh_1992> a rumor not quite as it seems
<alexxm> to be honest sports doesn't really intrest me the closest thing to a sport i'm intreasted in is pro wrestling
<MASF123> Ok I have to go know so bye.
<MadSurge> Big_Macintosh_1992: if they really liked their job they'd stay.
<alexxm> bye MASF123
<Big_Macintosh_1992> well... i guess MadSurge

<OneTrickPony> alexxm: I went biking and I have been hanging out with my friends
<FairysHuff> MadSurge: Girls with hooves..... mmmm.... *Drool*

<cow334> Nittany_Discord: good morning
<EspyLacopa> You grow to loathe Kefka because he's a villain who -loves- being a villain. He is evil because he is insane, and everyone around him knows it.
<Comet> Brony music vifeos
<Calcos323> twilight_sprinkle: Correct, but it's also a miracle, because ALL Turn-based JRPGs put me to sleep.
<IowaBrony> Hey, everybrony!
<EspyLacopa> And the longer you interact with him int he game, the more horrible evil things he does.
<Comet> hi
<sub06905> ello IowaBrony

But really they took the same CG models and made small changes to make them look like puppets. Then they animated the puppet versions of the characters in a CG black-and-white set. Then they used this technique called the kinescope effect, which adds scratches, hairs, and pieces of grain

<HotShot> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When he "arrests" Buzz 1, Buzz 2 says he is "in direct violation of Code 6404.5 stating all space rangers are to be in hyper-sleep until awakened by authorized personnel." Code 6404.5 is actually California's state law that bans smoking in public places.
<Dashite> JESmith71: Yeah, but he's got a belt new!

<Thedude946z[Movie]> Old barbie.
<owlicious> needs more g1 ponies
<TheSpitFirecolt> who voiced the dog in pat 3
<HotShot> 1,11RANDOM BARBIE TRIVIA: Early drafts of the original Toy Story had a Barbie doll in the role that became Little Bo Peep, but Mattel refused to license the character to Disney. The huge popularity of the movie (and boost in sales for Mr. Potato Head and other featured toys) led them to agree to have Tour Guide Barbie included in this film. Naturally, Mattel released Tour Guide Barbie as
<HotShot> 1,11an exclusive doll to tie in with the film.
<Calcos323> cha-ching :)
<RivaLz> This cracks me up xD
<Meanwhile> Potato head you're married.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01goes

<StinkomanFan> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Thedude946z[Movie]> My balls...
<Dark92Enigma> SPACEBALLS
<BlazeAngel> THE BALLS ARENT INERT
<HotShot> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the scene with Rex in the car in Al's Toy Barn holding the How to Defeat Zurg book, at 45:17 into the movie, there is one frame where we see a clear glimpse of the bottom corner of the book. As a lighthearted jab at Canadians the cover price is shown as $4.95 and $50.00 in Canada. It should be about $6.95.
<Obsidian> Noooooooooo
<bigred0603> ballsy move
<Vordox> LAWL
<Vordox> JURRASIC PARK
<desertman2> He could just go get another one
<IowaBrony> Rawr

<Dark92Enigma> DAT SPANISH
<VenHur96> Dat Jurrasic Park
<Dark92Enigma> ESE ESPAÑOL
<Bronysith> desertman2: one does not simply get another guide
<HotShot> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Directly after Rex lands back in the car in Al's Toy Barn, Tour-Guide Barbie quotes "Remain seated please" then repeats it in Spanish. This is a reference to the safety spiel on the Matterhorn at Disneyland. (In the Spanish version of the movie, she repeats it in French.)
<Dashite> Nah, that sounds like the right price HotShot...
<Obsidian> HotShot: Poor Canadians
<IowaBrony> I still hate this scene. Damn claustrophobia.
<DerpStar> cool HotShot I didn't notice that!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> 1995
<HotShot> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Tour Guide Barbie mentions that "Back in 1995 short-sighted retailers did not order enough dolls to meet demand". This is both an in-joke and a fact: When the original Toy Story was released, toy sellers did not think the movie would be a hit and they indeed did not order enough dolls to keep up with demand. The joke is also a self-deprecating dig at Mattel Toys,
<HotShot> 1,11which denied use of the Barbie character in the first film, thinking it would be a flop.
<Bronysith> IowaBrony: ikr
<owlicious> lol

<Dashite> We already know you're a robot Dari.
<HotShot> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: There was some discrepancy with regard to the song "When She Loved Me" and its place in the film. Randy Newman expressed concern over whether or not young children would be able to sit through the three-minute ballad while both Tim Allen and Tom Hanks admitted to being moved to tears by the scene featuring the song.

<HotShot> 1,11At the time of production, Pixar Animation was in the midst of a 5-picture deal with Disney. Pixar Animation had initially contracted with Disney to produce and distribute five computer animated films, three of which had already seen release: Toy Story, A Bug's Life& Monsters, Inc.. Though this movie was produced while Pixar and Disney were operating under the same contract, it was
<RaveBrony> little break? ok
<HotShot> 1,11counted as its own entity since the original agreement specified five original films, not sequels. Consequently, production on the final two movies of the initial deal,Finding Nemo and The Incredibles was delayed. When Disney, which owned all the characters, decided to move ahead with a low-budget direct-to-DVD sequel, Lasseter intervened, offering Pixar's services to produce the film.
<StinkomanFan> ok
<IowaBrony> We shall stay!
<HotShot> 1,11Lasseter assumed it would be counted as part of Pixar's 5-picture contract, but Eisner refused, forcing a tense renegotiation between the two studios. It also led to Pixar's refusal to renew it's distribution contract with Disney, though Disney eventually bought Pixar Studios and integrated its creative staff into studio management. When producers saw the first results of the considerably
<HotShot> 1,11lower-budget direct-to-DVD production they were dissatisfied and gave the project back to the makers of the original for a cinematic release.

<Dark92Enigma> brb
<RaveBrony> tl;dr
<HotShot> 1,11At the time of production, Pixar Animation was in the midst of a 5-picture deal with Disney. Pixar Animation had initially contracted with Disney to produce and distribute five computer animated films, three of which had already seen release: Toy Story, A Bug's Life& Monsters, Inc.. Though this movie was produced while Pixar and Disney were operating under the same contract, it was
<HotShot> 1,11counted as its own entity since the original agreement specified five original films, not sequels.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it seems it does
<VenHur96> Dat Walt Disney Records
<HotShot> 1,11Consequently, production on the final two movies of the initial deal,Finding Nemo and The Incredibles was delayed. When Disney, which owned all the characters, decided to move ahead with a low-budget direct-to-DVD sequel, Lasseter intervened, offering Pixar's services to produce the film.

<Wrek> 05we were kids. we could not admit defeat
