<Randomnerd> Hush, Ninjazz
<FillyFlam> Pssh. Girls don't like My Little Pony.
<Pega-sister> Silly filly boys hate ponies!
<xcanox> Boys hate ponies eh?
<Pega-sister> im seriously a girl irl o.o"
<Ninjazz> That's right.
<Ninjazz> Men love ponies.
<BronyJenkins> Then... I dont even know what's real any more.
<lollerguy> NOW YOUR A MAN, A MAYUN MAYUN MAYUN
<xcanox> I like to consider myself pretty masculine and I <3 ponies.
<Pega-sister> my classmate don't believe men watch ponies.
<Pega-sister> she said its a myth.
<lollerguy> :3
<Everlasting_Joy> Pega-sister a lot of people think that.
<Ninjazz> Your classmate is obviously wrong.
<BronyJenkins> We are a myth?
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Radu> Well, tell her that she's a myth too!
<Cypresswolf|Work> I gotta go - more delivery calls - see ya'll later :)
<Pega-sister> i see that she is wrong xD
<lollerguy> o noes, we're myths!
<Ninjazz> Cya Cypresswolf|Work

<lollerguy> cya Cypresswolf|Work
<Pega-sister> LOL okay xD
<Randomnerd> Bye, Cypresswolf|Work
<Ninjazz> I like being considered one of the dovahkiin of the internet. We're only a myth. Bah!
<xcanox> If Paul wasn't dead, he'd be a brony today.
<Pega-sister> if walt disney wasn't dead he would be an epic brony brony :d
<Ninjazz> ehhh.
<Randomnerd> Disney would have bought up the Ponies?
<Randomnerd> Hm.
<drf|away> 03ugh, now I'm starting to get tired
<Digit|Skyrim> nooo
<drf|away> 03I guess I can sleep now
<drf|away> 03I think I failed that exam x.x
<Digit|Skyrim> noo...
<xcanox> If Disney bought ponies, I wouldn't be a brony.
<xcanox> Disney sucks bawls.
<lollerguy> ^
<Digit|Skyrim> ^^^^^^^
<Pega-sister> Walt Disney the original creator of Sleeping Beauty and ETC.
<BronyJenkins> If disney bought MLP. I would die.
<Radu> Wild Bill
<Ninjazz> It does now...
<Viri> 14D:
<BronyJenkins> Twice.
<Randomnerd> Hasbro isn't much better than Disney, all things considered.
<MysticLugia> 04heyho
<Pega-sister> ^
<MysticLugia> 04back from vacation :D
<xcanox> Yeah but Hasbro doesn't make the show.
<Radu> PINGAS
<BronyJenkins> ^^
<xcanox> Team Faust does.
<Pega-sister> I think walt disney would make his kind of Ponies O:
<lollerguy> only thing i like from disney is the donald duck cartoon "der fuhrers face"
<Ninjazz> GO TEAM FAUST!
*Ninjazz touch hands
<lollerguy> WE HEIL
<Randomnerd> Hasbro owns it, therefore it has the last word.
<lollerguy> HEIL
<Radu> Disney just adds subliminal messages and crap
<lollerguy> RIGHT IN THE FUHRERS FACE
<Everlasting_Joy> Pega-sister and all of the ponies would be like AJ, no parents.
<Pega-sister> who plays Fable?
<BronyJenkins> HEIL
<xcanox> Ninjazz: You just created a file named "hands"
<Randomnerd> Everlasting_Joy: lol that's true.
<Randomnerd> No mothers, anyway.
*Ninjazz sends file to recycling bin
<lollerguy> i loved the pitt :)
<ACS13123> awkward noices....
<Pega-sister> what i meant to say was actually: If Walt Disney Was Still Alive He Would Watch MLP:FIM
<Ninjazz> He wouldn't ignore it.
<xcanox> The Beatles were the original bronies.
<SlurryMoon> 3hey, everyone, what's happening? :3
<cachi01> and he would have science to do
<xcanox> Just saiyan.
<Radu> Go to the Arena, make the Vikings proud!

<Pega-sister> Hai SlurryMoon
<Ninjazz> We talking about Disney.
<cachi01> !!
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy SlurryMoon.
<Randomnerd> Most modern animation owes its existence to Disney, like it or not.
<Ninjazz> True.
<FillyFlam> Hiya SlurryMoon
<cachi01> if waltdisney was still live that would be a triumph
<Pega-sister> its 00:00 pm. EVERLASTING JOY WOOHOO i love that i have my own room xD
<SlurryMoon> 3Nice to see you all
<Randomnerd> Even the "South Park" dudes have to define themselves in opposition to it.
<Radu> So many people that died way too early...
<BronyJenkins> Ohai SlurryMoon
<Ninjazz> But we can also credit Disney for most of the animation problems we have today, as well as corrupting a good number of our youth.
<Radu> Bono?
<Radu> Wasn't that a singer/band?
<Randomnerd> Or when Family Guy made fun of Disney -it still has to define itself in terms of what Disney IS.
<cachi01> is it LeeroyHoofkins or Hoofroy Jenkins??????
<Radu> Hoofroy Hoofkins
<BronyJenkins> [ImNamedLewisJenkinsLawl]
<cachi01> Radu: bono is the singer f U2
<Everlasting_Joy> Hoofroy Jenkins.
<Radu> Oh right
<Randomnerd> My Sister in Law used to work in animation, I learned a lot about this stuff from her.
<Randomnerd> She doesn't know I'm a brony :$
<cachi01> but then she took an arrow to th kne
<Meanwhile> Got distracted. What happened?

<Litwick> Everything Nuzlockes for a Nuzlocke.
<Jim> There's a walking dead game?
<SirGanjalf> Kammerjunk: He was in 4th as well

<Ninjazz> They don't usually make sinkers.
<CountDoofus> You could catch a few playthroughs of it, but then you'd be spoiling yourself. It's getting very good reviews thus far, though
<cachi01> Jim: the power rangers n64 game was good
<Frank> After 4 tries and 2 breaks and 2 relogs my guild maneged to kill Deathwing

<Dashie_Dashie> trogs, trogs everywhere.
<Ninjazz> Actaully, can you consider laser tech steam punk?
<pyrocatboy> Dashie_Dashie: ponies + biopunk= -me trembling in a corner of a room.
<Ninjazz> It seems a but too advanced for steam punk.
<lolol> how the hell can you think this is steam punk?
<Meanwhile> Lasers aren't really steampunk.

<Dark_Horst> cyberpunk is chips and implants and digital shit
<Dashie_Dashie> die one more time
<Dashie_Dashie> your game crashes
<pony_6500> Yeah you got a point there
<Meanwhile> Dat lie.

<alexxm> hey guys

<Dashie_Dashie> Wrek, the market.
<ghostpolitics> Wrek: It's in a locker where you did those fights
<Cobellanez> Hello everyone
<Dashie_Dashie> Lesbiands.
<pony_6500> Hi Cobellanez
<Ninjazz> Cobellanez, welcome.
<RankWinner> http://www.gateworld.net/news/2012/04/is-mgm-about-to-revive-stargate-sg-1/ PRAISE BE ONTO LUNA :O
*Midnight_Tempest snaps his fingers and makes random things burst into flames, including himself.
<Ninjazz> Dat Midnight_Mustang
<Meanwhile> Dafuq is Stargate.
<RankWinner> Wut
<Cobellanez> wat
*Dashie_Dashie puts out Midnight_Tempest
*RankWinner not sure if serious.
<CountDoofus> RankWinner: Wow. Almost thought that said "mom" instead of "mgm"
<F22skyhunter> what sohuld i do? i'm so bored...
<Dashie_Dashie> shut up woman ride my pony
<F22skyhunter> should*
<ghostpolitics> Wrek: The three fights you did to get out from slavery
<RankWinner> ;) Does anybody else here know what Stargate is...?
<Cobellanez> Yes
<pony_6500> I do
<Ninjazz> Nope.
<Dashie_Dashie> I do
<Dashie_Dashie> never watched it
<RankWinner> Wooo /)
<ghostpolitics> Wrek: You know where they drop those barrels full of radiation
<Midnight_Tempest> stargate is an old movie and show... of course i know it...
<CountDoofus> Know what Stargate is, but never got into it.
<Dashie_Dashie> dat running
<Meanwhile> Oh. Is it anything like Star Trek?
<Midnight_Tempest> dat trolling
<RankWinner> Aww yeah
<Bronysith> ive never seen star trek
<Ninjazz> From what I've seen, no.
<CrimsonPhoenix> star trek is best cause of Discord
<RankWinner> See, Stargate is awesome. Stargate Universe though... no. Just no.
<Meanwhile> Dunno, I'd have to see it first.
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: isnt that next generation though
<Rodonies> WAIT
<Rodonies> NO WAIT
<Rodonies> OMG SG1 REVIVE
*RankWinner is waiting.
<RankWinner> xD
<Rodonies> BEST DAY EVER
<Midnight_Tempest> it will never happen
<Ninjazz> :/
<CrimsonPhoenix> I dunno I never saw Star Trek :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> nor Star Gate :P
<RankWinner> Talks about it only. It could happen, hopefully
<Ninjazz> Uh oh?
<Meanwhile> Did you see Star Wars?
<Bronysith> of course
<Dashie_Dashie> saw some trek, never watched star gate.
<Midnight_Tempest> Star Trek: TNG, best of all Star Treks
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yes
<Bronysith> 4 5 and 6
<Ninjazz> What is a Star Wars?
<Meanwhile> You have to have seen something with the word "Star" in it by this age.
<pony_6500> Who has't seen star wars dude
<Shizuka> 13atlantis was good
<Dashie_Dashie> ^
<Midnight_Tempest> Ninjazz: its a War of Stars... obviously
<Ninjazz> Ohai Shizuka
<CountDoofus> My Little Star: Space is Magic
<Shizuka> 13hallo
<Meanwhile> Allo Shizuka. Atlantis?
<CountDoofus> hai Shizuka
<Midnight_Tempest> i honestly thought that Atlantis was boring
<Shizuka> 13while we're on the subject of stargate
<Ninjazz> I hear it got sunk.
<RankWinner> Atlantis and SG1 were Godlike. Just ignore the existance of Universe.
<RainbowAsh> Hiya
<Dashie_Dashie> My Little Starship: Fusion reactors are magic.
<RankWinner> Hiho RainbowASh
<Ninjazz> RainbowAsh, welcome.
<RainbowAsh> Hi RankWinner and Ninjazz
<pony_6500> Hey RainbowAsh
<Meanwhile> Atlantis is...?
<Shizuka> 13seasons 8-10 of SG1 started falling flat cause they'd assumed they were done
<RainbowAsh> Hi pony_6500
<Shizuka> 13and scifi kept renewing
<Dashie_Dashie> Stargate: Atlantis
<Ninjazz> A season of stargate it seems.
<Meanwhile> OIC.
<Shizuka> 13xcanox: one-to-one notices are considered rude by irc etiquette
<CountDoofus> My Little Normandy: Calibrations are Necessary.
<Rodonies> Atlantis was best
<RankWinner> Yep, then Atlantis took over and begun being even more awesome. And then Universe took over and just failed misserably.
<xcanox> Good.
<Rodonies> My original name here was Rodney, and before that it was Rodney Mckay :3
<Midnight_Tempest> Atlantis was boring... it only got good near the end of the series, like DS9
<Dashie_Dashie> My Little Railings: Leverage is Magic.
<Chrysalis> Universe showed so much promise
<Rodonies> Universe was good
<Chrysalis> then just lost it
<CountDoofus> My Little Arrow: Knees are Target.
<Meanwhile> Voyager is best ST.
<Rodonies> yeah
*Ninjazz has not watched any television in the past 3 years
<RankWinner> The first bits were decent, the middle was just crap and the end was awesome
<Midnight_Tempest> Meanwhile: I have to disagree with you there... TNG was best, Voyager was second
<Meanwhile> Though tbh, I like TNG more than Voy.
*RankWinner palms face.
<Chrysalis> I did enjoy Voyager as well Meanwhile what did you think of the prequel Enterprise?
<Meanwhile> But I've seen all of Voyaher.
<Rodonies> I seriously can't figure out why they replaced Universe with some wrestling show on A SCIENCE FICTION CHANNEL
<Midnight_Tempest> Enterprise was the worst ST i had ever seen... it showed such great promise though
<RankWinner> Sky News is saying that Trolls are a serious danger and that government sanctions need to be put in place to stop them. 6_9
<pony_6500> Rodinies: Really? What the hell?
<Meanwhile> I thought Enterprise didn't exist and should be fired into the sun.
<Rodonies> pony_6500: yes
<Chrysalis> RankWinner proof or it didnt happen
<Onyxia> hi everypony
<Rodonies> pony_6500: SciFi removed universe because they had more viewers at wrestling shows...
<CountDoofus> Voyager is the only series I've followed, so that gets my vote as well
<CountDoofus> hai Onyxia
<Midnight_Tempest> Enterprise ruined the continuity of the ST universe by bringing in species that apparently dont exist in ANY OTHER SHOW
<Rodonies> pony_6500: While universe was aired at a time in which most people couldn't watch it
<Ninjazz> Onyxia, welcome
<RankWinner> Chrysalis: Depending on their schedule the interview should be up soon, I'll link ye' if it comes up.
<Onyxia> i suppose wrek is streamin
<Meanwhile> Thing is although I love TNG, I haven't seen nearly as much of it as Voyager, so I don't really have much of a vote.
<Meanwhile> And I've only seen like, 7 episodes of DS9.
<RankWinner> I must ask, what is that steam notification to the right? Too blurry to actually see it.
*Ninjazz should watch more good television
<Meanwhile> RankWinner: Looks like the games ident code.
<Midnight_Tempest> DS9 is boring as watching paint dry... until the Dominion War starts, then it gets effing awesome
<RankWinner> Meanwhile: I thought steam didn't bother with those unless the game has online features that need them. Oh well.
<CountDoofus> I loved being a highlevel sneaky bastard in this game. Stealth crits are schweet.
<derpy_pony> imo it was the best of them all. Twenty times better than mother janeway and her big happy family. or wesley.
<RainbowAsh> Midnight_Tempest, ikr, the first season, everyone talks about how exiting it is to explore a new quadrant, and all the main characters do is sit on the station and settle minor disputes
<CrimsonPhoenix> Wrek why is your voice sexy?
<pyrocatboy> Anypony here a fan of Tremors?
<Onyxia> lol
<CountDoofus> I met Robert Picardo once, the hologram doctor in Voyager.
<alexxm> how was he CountDoofus
<Midnight_Tempest> RainbowAsh: they do that for nearly 4 or 5 seasons... i couldnt watch people on a station not DOING anything...
<ghostpolitics> pyrocatbot: Is that the movie about the giant man-eating worms?
*RankWinner is pleased with his school's OFSTED report "The progress of the majority of students across all year groups is well below expectations and is inadequate."
<CountDoofus> Met him at a convention. He was a bit edgy, but he'd just suffered through a truckload of geeks, so guess I can understand him :p
<CountDoofus> Sorry, Trekkies.
*pony_351602 JustLyra
<RainbowAsh> Midnight_Tempest, it gets a bit better when they get that ship with the cloak and actually do go somewhere, but yeah. DS9 is one of those series I would really like to like, but it doesn't make it easy for me.
<JustLyra> Wrong thing. Fawk. >_>.
<pyrocatboy> ghostpolitics: You broke into the wrong god-damned rec-room! Eeyup.
<Midnight_Tempest> RainbowAsh: the addition of the Defiant was awesome, but it only got worth watching in the later seasons when the Dominion showed up...
<Meanwhile> Omnom meatloaf.
<ghostpolitics> pyrocatboy: I love that movie, haven't seen it in years.
<pyrocatboy> ghostpolitics: I have all four movies.
<Meanwhile> U mad Scorpinok?
<pablez94> hi alexxm how's ur day been?
<Radu> Heh, this is so true: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-explanation.jpg
<derpy_pony> johan?
*pablez94 licks alexxm
<CountDoofus> What's the name of that giant bug in NV again? I hated those things.
<RainbowAsh> Midnight_Tempest, I watched it up to season 3 or 4 some years back. Maybe I should just jump right into s6.
*ghostpolitics is jealous
<Ninjazz> CountDoofus: Cazadors?
<alexxm> hey pablez94 i've been good
<CountDoofus> That's the one
<Ninjazz> Instantly knew what you were thinking about. :D
<JustLyra> Cazadors are bitches. >_>...
<alexxm> who wants pizza
<pablez94> Radu: mlp is lick an iceberg uh, well perfect metaphor
<Onyxia> ZedRed
<Radu> Indeed.
<pablez94> like* soryy radu
<Meanwhile> Shouldn't lick an iceberg, your tongue'll stick.
<Midnight_Tempest> RainbowAsh: well... you could but you might be confused about some things, some events... otherwise i would recommend doing that
<CountDoofus> I'd prefer Cazadors over Deathclaws anytime though
<pyrocatboy> Anypony here other than ghostpolitics a fan of the Tremors movies?
<alexxm> hey pablez94 someone humanized tom you want to see it
<RainbowAsh> alexxm, I am going to make some pizze later on tonight. :9
<pablez94> or i'm going to have cancer to my hands or i'm getting stupid.
<JustLyra> Tremors was amazing.
<pablez94> alexxm: eeyep
<Meanwhile> Boom
<Onyxia> 4901681160839
<alexxm> pablez94 http://www.wwe.com/superstars/therock
<Midnight_Tempest> I would rather fight a horde of Deathclaws than 2 Cazadors...
<RainbowAsh> Midnight_Tempest, I'll be fine, I got the internet to fill me in. ^^
<Ninjazz> O U alexxm
<Ninjazz> Didn't even need to click that.
<JustLyra> Because Deathclaws are nothing.
<pablez94> the rock? alexxm r u serious?
<derpy_pony> in fallout 1 and 2, deathclaws were easy if you had a decent gun skill...cripple the legs and run...
<Radu> Dat Cha-ching
<alexxm> i was just messing with you pablez94
<pyrocatboy> JustLyra: I am completely out of ammo. -collapses in disbelief- Thats never happened to me before.
<pablez94> alexxm: ook....
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dammit alexxm
<alexxm> what CrimsonPhoenix
<JustLyra> Hahaha. Oh god, that's a bad thing.
*pablez94 starts walking backward really slowly.... going as far as possible from that crazy guy of alexxm ...:D
<Meanwhile> pyrocatboy: I think they have pills for that.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that joke was....
<alexxm> what did i do pablez94
<CrimsonPhoenix> it was dull but I couldn't stop myself from laughing
<Ninjazz> Can you smell what alexxm is cooking?
<Meanwhile> Dumb Rock.
*pyrocatboy sprays Meanwhile with a fire extinguisher.
<pablez94> random messing...
*Meanwhile is foamy.
<CountDoofus> Think I'm gonna play some Modern Warf... Uh... Mahjong...
<alexxm> sorry pables94
<Radu> Ruins
<pablez94> ...makes me feel strange...alexxm
<Radu> Ruinssssssss
<Ninjazz> Oh mai.
*JustLyra sat down and watched the event.
<Radu> What
<FillyFlam> Omnomnom mac n cheese at 2 PM.

<alexxm> allright pablez94
<pablez94> i even made da":D" face so...
<CountDoofus> If you mean the opposite of "Old-fashion Time of Peace", then probably.
<CrimsonPhoenix> so THAT's where it's from
<Midnight_Tempest> dat kick
<JustLyra> Oh damn. >.>.
<ghostpolitics> The comments on that video :D
<Meanwhile> If you don't read the rules, you're gonna have a bad time.
<Radu> Oh, give me a break

*F22skyhunter now plays Ace Combat Assault Horizon
<RankWinner> People seem to not understand what the pirate bay does, if somebody is determined enough to pirate something (although most people aren't) they can still get it quite easily.
<CrazyCherry> Everypony's so quiet today!
<ShadowSparkle> HeroBrine_theBrone is your username the same as this one?
<Malavolent> Guys, how's the weather at your place?
<FillyFlam> It's raining up.
<RankWinner> Rain, flooding and drought.
<pablez94> ok evryony i've got to go to have dinner see ya in 20 minutes 1 more 1 less.
<FillyFlam> Stupid pegasi. Need to get it right
<alexxm> preaty good today Malavolent
<CrazyCherry> Malavolent: Clear and pretty hot
<HeroBrine_theBrone> Shadowsparkle: no and i check its at 12045 now
<Malavolent> I'd rather take raining, it's unbearably hot here.
<Malavolent> I can't force myself to do anything, just because of this stupid weather.
<ShadowSparkle> HeroBrine_theBrone: what is it called?
<peter> hi john
<HeroBrine_theBrone> HOld on
<CrazyCherry> Wat.
<alexxm> whats the cutter thing called
<ghostpolitics> The Man Opener
<FillyFlam> So, chat, be creative for me.
<FillyFlam> If Equestria had a DMV, what would it be called?
*alexxm releses clowns into chat
<pyrocatboy> alexxm
<Kammerjunk> I don't even know what that means!
<Malavolent> What's DMV?
<FillyFlam> Department of Motor Vehicles.
<xles> FillyFlam: DPV.
<pyrocatboy> alexxm: -is traumitized for life-
<alexxm> perhaps it would just be for pegasi and would be where they get they're license to fly FillyFlam
<HeroBrine_theBrone> peter:leave
<Randomnerd> Is there a name for the Pony who is "Strangely Obsessed with Tubs of Jelly"?
<alexxm> sorry pyrocatboy
<KaitoThePony> im back
<FillyFlam> It's the place where you get your driver's license. On the artist training ground the theme is a pony waiting, so I thought to do something with the DMV.
<Kammerjunk> Oh, Wrek's doing that quest now.
<Kammerjunk> Or DLC. Whichever.
<alexxm> hugh jelly i think Randomnerd
<ghostpolitics> Randomnerd: They fan name is Hugh jelly
<Randomnerd> lol
<Randomnerd> Thanks alexxm, ghostpolitics
<Malavolent> FillyFlam: What would ponies possibly drive?
<RainbowAsh> Malavolent, air ships are canon for once.
<alexxm> they at least have trains Malavolent
<ScootaChicken> ACTIVITY
<FillyFlam> I dunno, really...
<Kammerjunk> Steampunk is Magic.
<ScootaChicken> LOOK AT ALL THIS ACTIVITY
<alexxm> perhaps it would just be for pegasi and would be where they get they're license to fly FillyFlam
<Kammerjunk> ded
<ScootaChicken> Dear Princess Celestia: I'm so lonely...
<Kammerjunk> License to fly? I wouldn't think so.
<Kammerjunk> I mean, you can't get a license to walk, either.
<Malavolent> It sounds kinda weird that pegasus wouldn't be able to fly just because he doesn't have license.
<FillyFlam> alexxm: Yeah, that could work. I'll have to think of something creative and funny to happen there, though.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ScootaChicken: people kept abusing the bot yesterday, so he died
<RainbowAsh> Oh, oh, maybe the Flim Flam brothers needed a licence for their peculiar mode of transport.
<ScootaChicken> O_o
*CrazyCherry yawns
<ScootaChicken> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<alexxm> well at least where they learn to fly Malavolent and Kammerjunk
<ScootaChicken> NOT MAGNET
<ScootaChicken> HE CAN NEVER DIE
<ScootaChicken> NEVER
<FillyFlam> ...Flying Cider Squeezy 6000?
<RainbowAsh> Malavolent, it might be for the best, though, considering how much damage a pegasus can cause, like in Lesson Zero
<FillyFlam> Must happen.
<RainbowAsh> FillyFlam, yes, their mode of locomotion.
<Malavolent> RainbowAsh: Maybe, and maybe it would be better to send those untalented flyers to a certain factory.

I come back and you're playing Fallout 3. I'm gonna have to go in about half an hour and you're still playing Fallout 3.
<KwakLad> im soleyl a pc gamer Hazard

<Darkts3> Well there goes one of the best guns in the game =L
<Stinky_Pinkie> Talking and watching MLP Like a BAWWSS ;)
<OmegaMaretroidBrony> Awesomeness: The good man streaming is a mod. Only mods can stream
<Chrysalis> with a limited ammo pool, and no redeeming stats
<Hazard> Wrek: it is unique and the only one of it's kind. Selling it would be a tragic mistake. It's like selling the Firelance or the Captain's Sidearm!
*pablez94 "omg my magic is always something bad i keep doing bad tings with it... maybe i should cut my horn off"
<Awesomeness> oh
<cachi01> DUNT SELL UR ZAPPY GUN

<Awesomeness> how did you become mod?
<pablez94> CrazyCherry: i'm sorry for this... it's all over...(what did i do)O.O
<FillyFlam> He's not a mod, he's a robot.
<Chrysalis> and the fact there there are weapons with far better stats and dont require trips to an alien spaceship to get ammo
<cachi01> hey Tom

<BoS_Applejack> FO3
<^owlicious> to catch them is my real test, to train them is my cause
<Chrysalis> LOL!
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I wonder when New vegas game of the year comes out
<Chrysalis> thats my new favourite reaction
<CrazyCherry> OƐO
<That_Irish_Guy> Its sad that Scoot-Scootaloo is a robot :(
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Jelly of my Scopezzz?
<N4X> I love the equipment you get after the simulation, got to love it
<Kipkat07_Mare> why are they killing chineese soldiers?
<^owlicious> oil?
<Sauceboss> cause the Chinese invaded us
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I forget the backstory
<Kipkat07_Mare> that seems likely
<Sauceboss> liek right now
<BoS_Applejack> Kipkat07_Mare: Because they're oil greedy commies
<KwakLad> this is the part of the war that the giant robot was built to fight
<Meanwhile> Gib ALL the soldiers!
<CrazyCherry> ʎɹɹǝɥƆʎzɐɹƆ
<alexxm> probably this year Omega-Arceus-Ridley
<Sauceboss> compared to Oil Greedy Capitalists
<Kipkat07_Mare> BoS_Applejack: WOOT true dat
<That_Irish_Guy> Because the Chinese are invading Canada......
<Sauceboss> just saying
<Gunthler> Scoot-Scootaloo: phr33 st00f pl0x :D
<kirzstryfe> 1,3CrazyCherry, don't mess with the text
<Sauceboss> lol Irish actually the US invaded Canada
<alexxm> which DLC is this
<FillyFlam> All of the one shot
<Sauceboss> in Fallout
<BoS_Applejack> then they pussy out and start The Great War
<N4X> Kipkat07_Mare : Communists(Chinese) fight Demorcracy or shit and than suddenly there was war
<Dark_Horst> That_Irish_Guy: for example: if you would click house and mouse, and the program saqys 4 letters correct, that means the word you're looking for has the letters ouse in it. not necessarily in that order, but still
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I hope to god my dad doesnt try to buy me a computer with out letting me see what I want
<ghostpolitics> alexxm: Operation Anchorage I believe
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Because I don't want a stupid Mac
<Meanwhile> Nyeh, the back of my ear is wet.
<Kipkat07_Mare> Wrek: kill them all!!
<Dark_Horst> That_Irish_Guy: it's a mix of guessing and ruling out
<CrazyCherry> kirzstryfe: It's not like the rules say it's forbidden!
<N4X> Bass is now cannon lol
<alexxm> thanks ghostpolitics so hows your day been
<BoS_Applejack> Damn right you don't Omega-Arceus-Ridley there are NO DESKTOP PONIES FOR MAC
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03^ :'(
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> And what pisses me off is they know I want a new comp
<ghostpolitics> alexxm: It's been good so far, thanks for asking :)
<Sauceboss> then its time to buy a regular computer
<TheRainbowDash> CrazyCherry: It says that in the rules, mods have authority, that is the first thing it says in them.:P
<Sauceboss> for the ponies
<BoS_Applejack> I'm sorry Scoot-Scootaloo for reminding you of such evil
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> and yet they go buy 2 fucking Ipads
<That_Irish_Guy> I much prefer to put in the letters than to have a series of letters... like you would get 5 words then you would have to put them in order
<Meanwhile> Deserve it for buying a mac tbh.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Meanwhile: huh?
<RankWinner> Is it a laptop-Mac?
<Meanwhile> You're meant to go "RAGLERAGLERAGLE"

<RainbowAsh> N4X, well, the initial idea was that only Celestia and Luna were alicorns, but that got obviously changed after Lauren left. So, it's anybody's guess really. But even if Cadence was immortal, she would still grow up to be an adult, at least that seems logical to me

<TheRainbowDash> CupcakeWarrior: Umm, sure, ok!
<RainbowAsh> Corrupt, I played the original Fallout for a bit a long time ago. It was quite good for the time.
<drfsupercenter> 03I was gonna do 225MBish
<KJBrony> yes...yes they are...
<Shamroc> TheRainbowDash...are you doing weird things again?
<junh1024-XD> 250 then
<junh1024-XD> H264 + AC3

<SirGanjalf> Corrupt: You could get 1st Fallout for free on gog.com not so long ago. I advise to look for it there.
<drfsupercenter> 03and meh, would prefer 225 or less
<drfsupercenter> 03but I want AVI

<Dark92Enigma> How about a Nostalgia Critic episode?
<NightSeas> 02Okay, 1st, there’s nothing wrong with *killing trees*. That’s how we get wood LOL. 2nd, recycling is very important. Who knows how many trees wouldn’t be cut down if everyone recycled.
<NightSeas> 023rd, when you trash something just as much energy is going to be used to get that trash to the dump and process it.
<HyperMetalLugia> !blame for xanbreon being a bad troll
*ScriptBot blames Syrune|Away for for xanbreon being a bad troll.
<EpicPwnTime> nostalgia critic i agree

<TheRainbowDash> Wait what...
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: lol
<cachi01> lol
<NightSeas> 02I can understand that drf. But it’s your attitude about not being environmentally friendly that I don’t like
<Yahooz> lol sorry for the fail copy pasta
<Azureflames66> YEAH
*TheHoodyMaid is not a loser
<twilight_sprinkle> word up, Scoots!
<EpicPwnTime> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

<MahBoi777> whoa
<Azureflames66> and can destroy your liver
<LadyCanary> I liek to sing :#
<PonySwagg> Ponies, Ponies, Ponies...
<TheHoodyMaid> What is this about?
<ponies47> If its killing you stop reading |:(
<Yahooz> Sniped by the Shizuka
<drfsupercenter> 03NightSeas, I don't like your attitude of being a hippy :P
<drfsupercenter> 03basically
<Yahooz> ofc
<cachi01> ponies?
<EpicPwnTime> who did that
<drfsupercenter> 03here's my philosophy on this
<ponies47> me
<TheHoodyMaid> What is this about?
<Dark92Enigma> btw, my comment has been mentioned
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll recycle stuff if it's actually available. Like soda cans and bottles, there are recycling bins everywhere because that's a pretty big thing here
<TheRainbowDash> Woah there!
<Dken2021> not blank sheets!
<Azureflames66> calm down bro
<Azureflames66> brony i mean
<drfsupercenter> 03But here on campus there's nowhere else to recycle anything, so I throw it out. I'm not going to go out of my way to recycle my old homework assignments. The trees have already been killed, big dea.
<drfsupercenter> 03*deal;
<ponies47> U MAD BRO?
<drfsupercenter> 03and what I hate is "greenwashing"
<RaveBrony> O_o
<drfsupercenter> 03e.g. chopping giant holes out of DVD boxes with a recycle symbol
<Azureflames66> rofl
<PonySwagg> SCOOTALOO IS METAL
<Dark92Enigma> PIPEBOMB
<EpicPwnTime> say it with me now! you know what to do.
<twilight_sprinkle> this reminds me of that spongebob ep with the paper he had to write
<twilight_sprinkle> LOL
<twilight_sprinkle> called it?
<drfsupercenter> 03I intentionally throw those out (worse for the environment ironically :P) and put those movies in PROPER cases that are actually DURABLE and don't have holes drilled in them
<NightSeas> 02Calling everyone a hippy because they’re environmentally friendly is irrelevant
<EpicPwnTime> GET ON WITH IT!!!
<Dark92Enigma> What's the matter, McFly.....Scootaloo
<TheHoodyMaid> haha spongebob
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm not going to around just wasting stuff for no reason
<Dark92Enigma> ?
<Azureflames66> lol that episode of spongebob with the marching band
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't have a problem *using* materials tha tI actually need
<Dark92Enigma> GET ON. WITH IT!
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate those "TURN YOUR COMPUTERS OFF AT NIGHT" people
<MahBoi777> SWEET VICTORY
<Dark92Enigma> Band Geeks
<drfsupercenter> 03I have legitimate reasons to leave my computer on, so stfu and stop nagging me
<ponies47> YES GET ON WITH IT!
<TheRainbowDash> Hahaha, that Spongebob.:D
<EpicPwnTime> the y should show us band geeks
<Randomnerd> Hm?
<Randomnerd> Okay, that might have worked, I dunno.
<Azureflames66> show the grand galloping collab XD
<ponies47> Old Spongebob is good new is bad
<NightSeas> 02[19:37] <%drfsupercenter> But here on campus there's nowhere else to recycle anything, so I throw it out. I'm not going to go out of my way to recycle my old homework assignments. The trees have already been killed, big dea <-- it's not about the trees that are already dead, it's about the trees that will be cut down
<Azureflames66> THE GRAND GALLOPING COLLAB XD
<Dken2021> curse you THE, curse you to tartarus!
<ponies47> Now thats good stuff.
<Randomnerd> Can you read what I'm saying, or is my irc not working?
<drfsupercenter> 03they're going to do it either way
<drfsupercenter> 03most people don't buy recycled paper
<EpicPwnTime> sleeps
<Dken2021> I can
<Azureflames66> show pony parodies
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's fairly irrelevant
<ponies47> Yes
<TheHoodyMaid> Lol spongebob
<Randomnerd> Thank you, Dken2021 and ponies47
<Maid_Discord> 11,01BLANKITY BLANKITY BLANK!

<NightSeas> 02only like 25% of it isn't
<TheHoodyMaid> later
<CCCP> ohai everypony
<PonySwagg> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't like recycled paper, it feels cheap and flimsy compared to the fresh stuff

<MahBoi777> hey CCCP!
<drfsupercenter> 03but that's just personal preference :P
<CCCP> bye TheHoodyMaid

<FaithHeart> HI EpicPwnTime!
<Lambo> Anyone else feels this sad emptyness ever since season 2 ended?
*Gunthler gives CCCP some PONIES :D
<drfsupercenter> 03That's what's actually bad for the environment as it doesn't NATURALLY DECOMPOSE like paper does
<kenne> this is reminiscant of that one spongebob ep
<ponies47> YES!
<FaithHeart> I'm doing good. How are you?
<Xanbreon> Depends on the type of plastic

<Azureflames66> of course kenne i think he referenced it on purpose

<imjustaderper> hey evrypony
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle: what does that mean?
<drfsupercenter> 03Also, I hate that "You're a citizen, BE GREEN" attitude that government has,they really need to go after COMPANIES - look at things like video game controllers and accessories, those things come in plastic wrapping inside stupidly large plastic containers that just waste a crap ton of resources
<FaithHeart> hi everyone that just came in
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: it means go to hell
<Dken2021> lali-ho imjustaderper

<drfsupercenter> 03I remember when Wii points cards would come wrapped in plastic
<drfsupercenter> 03It's a fricking sheet of paper with a code. Why do you need to wrap it in plastic?
<Lambo> And in 5 weeks Game Of Thrones is over
<Lambo> Oh, gawd
<drfsupercenter> 03and if you actually save that plastic container you're a bit of an idiot
<pikorar> Picky and Spike!

<drfsupercenter> 03what do you want me to do >_>
<Randomnerd> flutter_spin: May I?
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't recycle it, at least not around here
<CCCP> Dken2021: they can ban you for fun you know /b/ has pretty much no rules that applies to mods too
<drfsupercenter> 03so that's what I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03it'snot *my* fauly
<drfsupercenter> 03t
<CCCP> pikorar: from 4chan
<drfsupercenter> 03at the same time, drill holes in my DVD boxes and they WILL sit in a landfill, I guarantee it >:P
<flutter_spin> It is there, but I GOTTA edit it. There are a ton of problems with the story
<CCCP> PonySwagg: oops tab fail?
<pikorar> CCCP: Oh, everyone gets banned from 4chan one time or another.
<ponies47> True
<Xanbreon> Meh@physical media
<Xanbreon> :/
<NightSeas> 02I agree with you there
<drfsupercenter> 03I agree when it comes to video games
<Dken2021> they banned you for lulz?
<CCCP> pikorar: but mine is a ban that will never go away
<drfsupercenter> 03I prefer downloads to discs
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03frayed knot
<flutter_spin> I'm also hoping someone will draw a picture for it.... Wrek maybe?
<CCCP> Dken2021: yup
<Dark92Enigma> Ok....this is supossed to be My Little Ponies' Ponies, right? I can't find it anywhere....

<Azureflames66> hi imjustaderper
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not wasteful unless you throw it out
<CCCP> Dark92Enigma: I LOOOOOOOVE ponies

<Xanbreon> I got an R4DS when 2 carts dropped out of my coat somewhere
<MahBoi777> hi cutenesskitteh and Alister
<CCCP> EpicPwnTime: ಠ_ಠ﻿
<Xanbreon> That really pissed me off

<drfsupercenter> 03I used to like owning DS games too
<flutter_spin> I have really poured my heart into my fanfic
<CCCP> omg hi Alister!!!!!! :D :D :D
<NightSeas> 02oh, so you're saying game artist and developers aren’t making loads of money?
<drfsupercenter> 03but I've since sold or donated all of mine and I just use the AceKard
<drfsupercenter> 03They aren't
<CCCP> flutter_spin: whats it about?
<drfsupercenter> 03Nintendo is
<drfsupercenter> 03not the people who make the game
<NightSeas> 02they are
<HeroBrine_theBrone> flutter_spin: bashes head through desk
<drfsupercenter> 03not really.
<cutenesskitteh> Who's a-streamin?
<drfsupercenter> 03Not from direct game purchases at least
<ponies47> Me
<flutter_spin> Its about uh.. its about finding more about a mysterious voice
<cutenesskitteh> No, really? :D
<CCCP> cutenesskitteh: you are
<HeroBrine_theBrone> Anyone want so hear the best singing ever?
<Alister> no
<ponies47> meh
<PonySwagg> Oh hay
<drfsupercenter> 03and if you care that much, why not just write the developers a check for $30, then download the ROM - that way you save resources and so on and so forth being green yadda yadda
<flutter_spin> The plot revolves around the mystery. I don't want to spoil it
<CCCP> cutenesskitteh: jk
<Dken2021> twilight's a book nerd
<drfsupercenter> 03|:P
<drfsupercenter> 03-|
<Alister> varying degrees of meh
<PonySwagg> Lookit cute Scoot in cute outfit
<Biglaw> I am listening to I am the walrus, I am hearing the best singing ever
<NightSeas> 02The people who make the game make an average of about $80,00o/year
<NightSeas> 02And yes, I did my research as I’ve been thinking about going that route
<CCCP> flutter_spin: i cant wait to read it when u finish it can u link it?
<ponies47> the correct word is egghead Dken2021
<HeroBrine_theBrone> Biglaw: koo koo catchoo
<NightSeas> 02$80,000*

<cutenesskitteh> Glad "that certain thing" hasn't "started" yet >_>
<drfsupercenter> 03but I do know the platform (e.g. Nintendo/Sony/Microsoft) make stupidly high amounts of money on every game sold for their systems
<Alister> Quick ! to the secondary keyboard !
<drfsupercenter> 03meaning the developers aren't getting as much as they could or should
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
