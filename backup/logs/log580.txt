<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> SuperBrony64: But i don't think he knew the stream was on, not even I noticed.
<Polydunami> Well, Flash didn't crash for a long time until just now :|

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Disc 3: Aboard the Nautilus
<owloysius> SuperBrony64: what is the show about?
<OtakuTom> DixInfernus: Just anime, not a visual novel.
<Spectrum_Rush|> Ninjazz: yes and when you're not her i step in
<Spectrum_Rush|> *here
<DixInfernus> Ah, ok.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This show is about these two kids and their adventure out in the ocean.
<Polydunami> My ads are asking if I like Asian women... why is that even being asked?
<Lunar_Brony> superretroworld I haven't heard very many, but I'm gonna say either "Last Train to London" or another song can't remember the name of. Overture of something . . . lemme find the name
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It's inspired by 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
<ArcherJoe11> More "Made by Hideaki Anno"? YES!!!
<Vordox> Who here knows Touhou and enjoy it?
<Spectrum_Rush|> Polydunami: search history o3o
<Polydunami> I know OF Touhou...
<OtakuTom> I know of Touhou, but I haven't played any of the games.
<owloysius> i've played touhou, ambivalent about it
<Vordox> Polydunami: Manzai?
<Polydunami> Hmm...
<Lunar_Brony> superretroworld 10538 Overture. That's my other favourite
<Polydunami> Manzai?
<Vordox> Boke wara desu?
<Vordox> Ah..
<otakon> wait
<Vordox> erm, let's take it more
<DixInfernus> I actually have been meaning to watch Nadia.
<Vordox> Heard of the Grand Prix Touhou Fan Boke celebrations? :)
<otakon> THIS is based loosely on 20K leagues?
<otakon> REALLY!?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Aye
<otakon> I did not know that.
<superretroworld> Lunar_Brony: kool, Mr. Blue Sky is a really good one
<sagas> may I ask what the hell again?
<Ponies47> Back from mah shower :P
<Polydunami> This is anime is mostly good. Mostly.
<otakon> Sadly it's 1:42 AM here
<otakon> so I gotta go
<Alpha-Omega> I feel young here in terms of t.v shows
<AttacktheAndalite> Night otakon
<Polydunami> Watch this on your own time, otakon
<otakon> bye all, take care I'll bb tomorrow
<Lunar_Brony> superretroworld . . . and "Ticket to the Moon". Kinda cuz of the concept, yah know, but the song is damn catchy too
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You think they would just create a random character called 'Captain Nemo' for now reason :3
<Sumica> 00,10I thought it was based on macross, cause it has captan global
<Lunar_Brony> g'ngiht otakon
<OtakuTom> I remember having the chance to buy some original animation cels from this series a few years ago...I should have, but at the time, I didn't like the show.
<Vordox> guess I am the only boke lover here. :'(
<SuperBrony64> 11,02no*
<otakon> Polydunami: I should but I don't know where it is.
<DixInfernus> ...That commander looking guy... He looked like the commander from Macross.
<otakon> Sumica: same here
<otakon> DixInfernus: Global
<Polydunami> Well if all else fails, internet.
<DixInfernus> Yes, Global. Ty. I has been forever since I last watched it.
<OtakuTom> I wonder if my friend still has them for sale (he owns an anime shop in Milwaukee)
<Vordox> I missed one episode I see...
<Polydunami> Although I would prefer watching anime on actual DVDs...
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Gargoyle!
<Vordox> Wait..
<Alpha-Omega> random craving for bufallo wings
<Vordox> How could I miss t
<Lunar_Brony> the Natalus?
<Polydunami> Or VHS, seeing as I still have a player.
<Saturn> 08,01Polydunami: i download bluray rips
<Vordox> YOu all sure it was episode 9 we left?
<Lunar_Brony> I'm intrigued by this
<ArcherJoe11> yes.
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Dat accent
<sagas> dat accent
<Alpha-Omega> yup
<Spriggals> Frenchy
<ArcherJoe11> Kiss her!
<Polydunami> The Islanders? No, they've been horrible lately :S
<Alpha-Omega> french kiss her
<Alpha-Omega> :D
<Saturn> 08,01my god, why are coco-pops so amazing...
<sagas> :D
<sagas> naughty
<Polydunami> Also, I mainly watch anime by stream :P
<otakon> THAT IS GLOBAL
<DixInfernus> Global, *before* the SD-F1...
<DixInfernus> Ha! Called it!
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Aye save us pretty please XD
<oni_link> the redhead sounds like Jessie of Team Rocket
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn: What do they taste like?
<otakon> Yoo hoo, save us
<Alpha-Omega> cocoa puffs? knock offs?
<OtakuTom> Polydunami: I've started to run out of space to put all my DVDs. I'm at well over 500 discs of just anime. I'm starting to appreciate sites like Crunchyroll where I can stream shows. Funimation also allows subscribers to stream a lot of their anime as well (unlimited access or $7 a month)
<otakon> dammit don't wanna go
<Spriggals> I wonder if anyone will make a dubstep remix of radio sounds like that
<Polydunami> I hope not.
<Saturn> 08,01AttacktheAndalite: they're rice krispies but with cocoa on them
<otakon> okay enough stalling
<Spriggals> It would make me laugh
<otakon> I'm out for now, take care
<oni_link> OtakuTom: what you are suffering from I hope to achieve someday :D
<ponibas> OtakuTom, FUNimation has a lot on their YT channel
<otakon> thanks Sumica, Saturn, SuperBrony64 for the streams
<OtakuTom> See you later, otakon
<Saturn> 08,01wikipedia tells me that they're called cocoa krispies in the US
<otakon> bye all!
<DixInfernus> g'night otakon
<Alpha-Omega> I'm sure they'll dubstep remix anything. It just has to catch their attention
<Ninjazz> Cya, otakon. Sleep well.
<oni_link> bye otakon
<Vordox> THERE WE GO
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Np otakon :)
<Polydunami> Why am I not surprised, OtakuTom? :3
<ponibas> Saturn, oh those.. they are good
<Vordox> Saw Nadia 8 on 4x speed with forward skip
<Vordox> I'm up to date andd missed NOTHING
<Lunar_Brony> Saturn what, Cocoa Rice Krispies now?
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn: aaaaaahmahhhgaaaahd.....I have yet to make rice krispies out of the cereal
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Santa Claus :D
<Lunar_Brony> Vordox seems legit
<OtakuTom> Hey, I have to live up to my name as much as I can :P
<ponibas> lol
<Vordox> Lunar_Brony: I'm very perceptive and multitask able :P Was an easy feat to watch 25 minutes in 3 minutes
<DixInfernus> Hrm.. I should probably sleep as well. Feeling extremely tired for some reason.
<Saturn> 08,01AttacktheAndalite: really easy to do
<Alpha-Omega> hmmm I don't like rice krispies
<Polydunami> So America have Rice Krispies while Britain have Rice Pops?
<Saturn> 08,01you just intensely heat rice
<AttacktheAndalite> Ohai SuperBrony64 *hugs and gives you a filly Twilight*
<DixInfernus> Hope to see you all again soon.
<Lunar_Brony> Vordox wow, I'm not even watching the stream. Not my prefered tast
<Saturn> 08,01Polydunami: no, they're called Rice Krispies here too
<sagas> smartass
<Polydunami> Oh yeah?
<Lunar_Brony> seeya DixInfernus
<OtakuTom> ponibas: I prefer using their site instead of the youtube channel because you can get HD on a lot of the shows, and subscribers also get uncensored versions.
<Saturn> 08,01they tried to rename Coco Pops to Choco Krispies, but people complained

<Ponies47> You ar to Saturn (No homo) <3

<ponibas> lol Shizuka
<Polydunami> I haven't watched anime for a while. I mainly read manga scanlations.
<OtakuTom> I just finished Haganai a few days ago, and I'm also trying to catch up on Asobi ni Ikuyo, Freezing, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, and watching the simulcasts of Total Eclipse, Sword Art Online, So I Can't Play H, and Campione.
<Vordox> XD
<Polydunami> Well, at least not on my own time.
<Ponies47> Oh yeah ponibas. What's your Steam name? I'm on a computer with Steam so now I can add you :P

<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> :P
<Major> SCIENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Saturn> 08,01i actuall have no idea
<Vordox> OtakuTom: Madoka = Good, Freezing = AMAZING imo, but overrated.
<OtakuTom> And if I'm going to start up the web site I'm planning, I'm going to have to watch even more simulcasts, possibly even everything being simulcast on Crunchyroll and Funimation.
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> This is aperture sience's old old old ship.
<Lunar_Brony> did somepony say . ..
<Saturn> 08,01yeah, he's the director
<Saturn> 08,01wait, no

<Ponies47> Oh dear! O_o
<Saturn> 08,01Laurent is the director
<Saturn> 08,01he's a producer
<Vordox> OtakuTom: I recommend a few mangas for you, including Magic Hx0, Negima, Kimi no Knife, Otaku no Mutsume-san, Sankarea.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02THE SECRET BLUE WATER!!!
<Vordox> And of course Fairy Tail if you're for Shounen
<Spriggals> COMMER- wait
<Ponies47> The SuperBrony64!
<Polydunami> NEGIMA
<Alpha-Omega> I was reminded of My Little Portal episode one x(
<OtakuTom> Wow...I'm way behind on Negima...I started reading that when it first came out in the US.
*SuperBrony64 glomps Ponies47
<ArcherJoe11> Polydunami: had a good run, didn't it?
<Lunar_Brony> aww, buck it. I don't feel like spitting out science facts to make myself look smart tonight
<Polydunami> Umm, Fairy Tail is good, but drags on a little much sometimes :P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02"Mom"?~
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: :'(
<Vordox> OtakuTom: I've been picky with my mangas lately. And so far it love it :P
<Vordox> Polydunami: The Anine or the manga?
<Razyn> ArcherJoe11 YO JOE
*Ponies47 Points a gun at SuperBrony64 "Do that agian I DARE YOU"
<OtakuTom> I'm a bit sad that it finished in Japan (IIRC, at least...I try to follow Akamatsu, and I'm pretty sure it ended, though he said he may bring it back later)
<Polydunami> I'm only reading the manga
<Polydunami> .
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O;;
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I don't wanna be shot O~O
<Vordox> Polydunami: The manga is fast compared to the anime. :P
<Vordox> OtakuTom: Akamatsu I have not yet read. ><
<Alpha-Omega> wear a bulletproof vest
<ArcherJoe11> Yo Raz. Sorry I couldn't join monday, but I can make it tonight,
<noname> SuperBrony64: catch the bullet with your teeth

<Vordox> "again" XD
<Razyn> Aight Joe. Good to see ya though
<Lunar_Brony> who's Joe?
<Polydunami> Right now, I'm reading Skip Beat.
<OtakuTom> Akamatsu is great. I don't think I ever finished AI Love You, though I had quite a few volumes of it. I absolutely loved Love Hina and Negima.
<Vordox> OtakuTom: I seriously recommend Berserker and Otaku no mutsume-san. Best mangas imo.
<Lunar_Brony> and Raz?
<ArcherJoe11> Polydunami: One Piece "Picks up" again these days.
<Alpha-Omega> He's Jealous
<Razyn> Lunar_Brony?
<ArcherJoe11> Lunar_Brony: I am Joe

<Lunar_Brony> Razyn ArcherJoe11 oh. I wasnt' paying attention

<Soul> oh, ok
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hugs ^-%
<OtakuTom> I also don't read scanlations as a personal choice, just like how I avoid fansubs in almost all cases (I'll make exceptions in certain cases, like if the show's on Crunchyroll or Funimation streaming and I just can't buffer, I'll download a specific episode to watch, since my money's still going to CR/Funi for the subscriptions)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^-^*

<Vordox> Shizuka: = Best dude on BrS
<OtakuTom> Vordox, I'm gonna have to harass you later about a desktop pony for me, but I'll wait until you're satisfied with the mods and Phase, since theirs are probably more important than mine, anyway :P
<CriticKitten> Shizu is....damnit Vordox. xD

<Vordox> I havenät. :) Pre sketch is like the very first sprite attemts.

<Shizuka> 13Spectrum_Rush|: silly filly we know about that pic..
<Vordox> There's ALOT that can still change, like Phase4's hindlegs, Saturn's Front legs, Saxy's head/hair, Shizuka's Hair.

<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02i just broke all the things

<Vordox> Let me ust say this = Shizuka's HAIR I HATE SPRITING it... It's impossible. D:
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 my entire school might as well know I'm a brony
<Shizuka> 13you can make it longer if you want .-.
<Mishia> someone had a crush :'(
<Spectrum_Rush|> Shizuka: i actually linked the wrong link of that pic though, i wanted to link the one that has a name next to each one for those who never seen it before
<Lunar_Brony> hey!
<Vordox> Shizuka: It's not the longer, it's ... I can't say a mess, but it pointing everywhere. :P
<Soul> the only pony i recongnize in that pic is scoot-scootaloo
<Lunar_Brony> I don't whine, I complain!
<Shizuka> 13per the original canon sketch wrek still won't color http://i.imgur.com/wlxME.png
<OtakuTom> Granted, I could probably make my own if I could get Wrek's OC. My OC happens to be the same colors as his, and I could probably make the alterations needed to the hair and cutie mark, then adjust the extra sprites for the animations to suit my character.
<Vordox> Ooooh!
<Vordox> Shizuka: Can I use that instead?
<Shizuka> 13ok
<Lunar_Brony> Soul I recognized Scoot-Scootaloo, Phase4, and Luna (of course)
<Alpha-Omega> I'm not a noob here but I have not been here long
<Mishia> Shizuka: OH WOW
<Vordox> Shizuka: This is ALOT easier and cuter. <3
<Mishia> Vordox: man if you use that o-o
<Ponies47> Lunar_Brony: Everybody in middle school. I'm gonna be a wittle freshman this year. So nobody must know my secret! Plus I'm scared to. :(
<Mishia> Lunar_Brony: THIS IS WHINING :3
<Ponies47> Everybody in middle school knew*
<Lunar_Brony> Mishia I know what whining is
<Mishia> Lunar_Brony: :( i just felt like using a qoute at that moment.
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 I never had Middle School. Went straight from Elementary to Secondary (High School)
<Polydunami> Well, I've been here for seven months now. That probably means I'm not a Bronystate noob anymore, but I don't know for sure 6_9
<Shizuka> 13i have been trying to get wrek to vector und color that sketch for months... so if ponies could help poke
<Alpha-Omega> I pretty muched showed everyone at my church by showing them my drawing of ponies
<Ponies47> Lunar_Brony: Ah I see.
<Alpha-Omega> much
<Eulshy> venonats drive me crazy
<Mishia> Ponies47: im going to be a freshmen as well. *hides behind Ponies47*
<Lunar_Brony> Mishia I used it on my mother once, whining and all . . . the reaction was priceless
<Vordox> Are you asking your brony army to poke Wrek?
<Vordox> :P
<Lunar_Brony> Vordox eeyup
*Lunar_Brony pokes Wrek
<Spectrum_Rush|> hmm... whos the mod named Diftaku?, i've never seen him on before
<Ponies47> Mishia: I'm scared to :(
<OtakuTom> I've been here...well...if you count my very first visit, I've been here for 10 months, but I've been here consistently for about...oh...8 months, I think?
<superretroworld> Ponies47: chances are there may be bronies at your high school, so it may be easier to make friends
<Soul> ive been here one month :P
<Eulshy> there's a pegasister at my high school, she makes plushies
<Ponies47> Just remeber everypony. NEVER poke Shizuka or she will get the pool noddle :s
<oni_link> Eulshy: thats awesome
<Mishia> Lunar_Brony: XD that must have been priceless indeed. But of course, for my mom i would get slapped. I swear, i would be ok with that if it wasnt that she rage-whined all the time when she is having problems :3
<Lunar_Brony> superretroworld I became a brony in my second year of high school.
<Eulshy> and i buy them for 15 dollars each
<Alpha-Omega> pool noodle?
<Mishia> I became a brony last year december
<Polydunami> I started signing on to Bronystate at a low point in my life, actually.
<XAX> Cant quite name all the mods in that picture of them in the movie theater :(

<XAX> Ponies47: I wore a Rainbow Dash headset and had my McD's Pinkie toy attached to my school bag for a month. Found a grand total of 1 brony.
<Sabershy> Alright, Good night everypony. I am starting to get really tired.
<Polydunami> We've actually had G3.5 streamed before, Soul.

<AttacktheAndalite> Night sabershy
<Vordox> Ribbit
<superretroworld> Lunar_Brony: Ponies47 you know what i dont understand is nobody in my school has ever talked about the show, i dont get it, is it not famous yet for regular ppl?
<Lunar_Brony> XAX I found a brony at a corner story while I was wearking RD headphones
<XAX> Lunar_Brony: :o
*oni_link pats Ponies47 on the head while he takes his Sherlock bubble pipe out
<Mishia> Ponies47: im going to wear my "pinkiepie is watching you" shirt and make a 'yay' whenever somthing good happens for the frist day
<Mishia> Ponies47: bronies will be a good frist-friends group in highschool :3
<oni_link> Ponies47: youll be fine, birds of a feather flock together!
<Ponies47> superretroworld: You would think you would atleast find one with a OVER 4 MILLION PEOPLE FAN BASE :p
<Ponies47> oni_link: :3
<Mishia> oni_link: exactly! hoplefully these wont be like the bronies in middle school. the bronies in my middle school din't consider me a brony because im a girl >:( dont ask why
<Barbetos> So what is this?
<Soul> half of that 4 million people fanbase are bronies in secret
<Soul> like me :P
<Lunar_Brony> Barbetos that
<oni_link> Ponies47: :$
<Barbetos> wut?
<Mishia> I hope i dont insult the brony community to much :(
<oni_link> Mishia: Thats weird. I would think they'd let you in easier if anything?
<Ponies47> Mishia: I had no friends in middle school. I want that to change for high school. I do want to have bronies as friends so we can hang out and such. There is NO WAY I'm wearing any of my pony swag until I'm settled down and I have friends and such :(
<superretroworld> Ponies47: ikr
<Barbetos> I am insult and that makes me feel brony Mishia
<Vordox> Mishia: D: Say you're a pegasis if you''re uncertain
<Vordox> WHOT SAMSON
<Vordox> DO NOT SACRIFICE YOURSELF
<Vordox> D:
<Ponies47> superretroworld: Yeah :<
<Spriggals> He just punched a woman
<Barbetos> Real man
<Vordox> No HANZ, SAMSON! :'(
<Mishia> Ponies47: i only got friends because we were a "rejects' group.
<Vordox> Dat smirk...
<noname> Mishia: Ouch :(
<Mishia> Ponies47: im more worried that people will find me to annoying or not fun
<Alpha-Omega> I wish my beard was thicker
<oni_link> Mishia: Thats sounding alot like me back then. Highscool changed me for the better :)
<Lunar_Brony> Mishia I know that feel
<Soul> Mishia: they were just being jerks
<Mishia> noname: the rejects groups was the nice group :)
<noname> Mishia: You got a point there :)
<oni_link> Ponies47: Just be you, be open minded and they'll come around :3
<Vordox> LAWL JEAN YOU ARSEHOLE
<Vordox> :D
<Polydunami> According to my spellcheck, "goddamn" should be "godparenthood". What in tarnation?
<Mishia> Polydunami: Apple doesnt like swears.
<Vordox> Smart point Kid
<AttacktheAndalite> Lol Polydunami
*oni_link is liking how his chiptune project is coming along :3
<Polydunami> Also, the C word should be "cult".
<Vordox> Wrong place there, Jean
<Ponies47> Mishia: I really had no friends I hated going to a private school. I would rather just sat outside the lunchroom and ate my lunch out there insted but no I had to sit at a table. But I really want that to change for highschool. People thought I was annoying in middle school :(
<Vordox> INB4 AGONIZING DEATH
<Ponies47> oni_link: Ok :3
<Soul> people are too... judgemental
<Mishia> Ponies47: your not annoying! I make more sense as annoying due to my chatterbox nature, baby-ish voice i use when im shy, and the whole ADHD hyperactics
<superretroworld> Ponies47: i had the same problem
<Vordox> Ppueeerufeeeeuct
<Vordox> Erm, Jean, try and stop the holes.....
<Ponies47> Mishia: Everypony wubs me in here. I just wish that would be the same way in real life. I would tend to do some annoying stuff liek talk weird and such.
<Mishia> You know what bothers me with people? When they have a problem with you and they wont tell you. If you want to insult me, tell me eaxctly whats wrong and i will do what i can
<Soul> just because you talk a lot doesnt make you annoying
<Vordox> Mishia: Indeed.
<oni_link> Ponies47: If theyre douches, theyre not worth the time :D I found my friends because I was a cheery chap to be around :P All I gotta say is self esteem matters alot so keep that in mind too.
<Ponies47> oni_link: I hated the popular kids. They always think there so cool -_-
<Polydunami> I tend to be quiet in real life. As in, not talk at all.
<superretroworld> oni_link: very good point
<oni_link> Mishia: Thats society unfortunately.
<Alpha-Omega> Same here
<Vordox> ALL DED, DED I TELL YOU
<Vordox> SHUT UP WOMEN
<Soul> the "popular kids" are never really popular, they just are so well known because theyre jerks with a few friends
<Mishiaia> lost my nickname
<Mishiaia> due to the internet pooping
<Mishiaia> anyhow
<Alpha-Omega> They used to call me Nips in JROTC :3
<oni_link> Ponies47: Just like I did. They thought they were better than everyone and I gave em the cold shoulder and showed them. and now a couple years later, they have matured and seen that im a pretty fun dude to be around. Im very fluttershy around new people but if i can trust em, Im a total Pinkie Pie :D
<Mishiaia> XD
<Mishiaia> oni_link: same here XD
<Vordox> MANLY laughs
<Eulshy> damnet i hate venonats
<oni_link> Mishiaia: whoo!! *throws party poppers all around*
<Ponies47> oni_link: I'm a total Pinkie Pie as well! :D But I know with starting high school and all. I'm gonna be a HUGE Fluttershy :(
<oni_link> Eulshy: but, they like you :(
<Soul> im usually very serious around people, but when im with my best friends, i usually am optimistic and cheery
<Alpha-Omega> I'm a ghost
<Polydunami> I'm a banana!
<Eulshy> oni_link: If they liked me they would all stop having Compund eyes and have tinted lens instead
<oni_link> Ponies47: Its natural. Im still a bit like that. But when Im feeling like that, I make it my objective to break the ice :P
<Polydunami> Mishiaia, you can switch back now.
<Mishiaia> Ponies47: it got way harder when i got this ingrown toenail and infection. Goooooood it hurt *not much right now* and i couldn't wear socks and my feet always stank :| so people would say i smell bad and im like "Guys, if i could do somthing, so you would be more compterful, i would! That purfeume isnt helping anyhow. Saddly, its not me. OK?!?", but i was to shy to explain the problem.
<mishia> f

<Polydunami> Some people, fucking hell :|
<Lunar_Brony> mishia nice

<Lunar_Brony> There was a dance at the end of Grade 7 (which was the last year of elementary for me), but I didn't go to it because I don't care about dances and stuff. I always feel like either a sore thumb or a doormat at dances
*oni_link gives Ponies47 a hi hoof because of awsome sunglasses and because he uses the same shades smiley as him

<Lunar_Brony> HatchetRyda wha-who? What message?
<Alpha-Omega> I've been to 3 high schools so I lose track of all that stuff
<oni_link> Soul: because of stupid logic. They see that if you were involved and didnt try to stop it, its the same as fighting.
<mishia> Lunar_Brony: also being the only girl in a fancy dress instead of a causal dress

<oni_link> all I got is Budweiser. Well, its better than nothing. Im game Lunar_Brony :D
<Vordox> Soul Faithful Farmer
<Barbetos> The flash game itself seems to be off..
<Vordox> It's a alpha game of Figure Fighting RHF
<Vordox> But it has some issues atm
<Lunar_Brony> oni_link it's from a pony drinking game. I lost the pic when my old computer fried
<Biglaw> SO MANY CHANGELINGS
<Lunar_Brony> Biglaw IKR?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wow, the timing is off in this game.

<Lunar_Brony> Soul IKR? /)^3^(\
<Biglaw> Good morning Malavolent
<oni_link> Mornin Malavolent
<noname> SuperBrony64: It looks very delayed
<Vordox> It's not delayed
<Vordox> It's prestrike
<Vordox> You need to doit earlier then the beat
<Lunar_Brony> oni_link I did the game with another guy over Steam chat who recorded it and posted it to Youtube. Watching it again . . . not sure if I should've been laughing or crying at my memories
<Soul> Lunar_Brony: /)
<Vordox> So alot of people are having issues with it
<Lunar_Brony> Soul /)
<Vordox> You need to click JUStbefore the beat to make the sound of the hoof hit to be the beat
<Vordox> Causing it to be slightly offsynched
<Polydunami> Yeah, that's not very good design.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Vordox: Yeah, that's not how Rhythm Heaven is played :P
<Vordox> I know SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You play it ON the beat

<oni_link> Lunar_Brony: Thats all that matters then :D
<Vordox> Try watching some REAL videos of the Rhythm is Magic. :P
<Alpha-Omega> I understand
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Anyway, it's cool, but still needs to be tweaked ^-^

<Ryunosuke> lemmings are bad mmmkay? :)
<oni_link> bye WalkerPony89
<Soul> lol
<ArcherJoe11> brb
<Ryunosuke> let me explain lemmings in EVE
<Alpha-Omega> well a lot of people should try making html5 games there is no need for flash and it seems highly capable in the long run considering it is going to be the new standard of web coding
<Biglaw> This was so random
<Vordox> >.>
<Vordox> But...Alpha...
<Vordox> It's HTML 5
<Vordox> Not Flash
<Barbetos> Aw... Stream over..
<Barbetos> now what am I gona do all night?
<Barbetos> Sleep is so boring
<Vordox> Remove Flash = Remove ponies
<oni_link> Alpha-Omega: And the sooner that happens, the sooner we can stop depending on Flash. Im sick of it
<Ryunosuke> you warp to a gate at 0, FC (Fleet Commander) tells you to HOLD ON THE FUCKING GATE cause there is an enemy fleet on the other side, some damned fool decides to jump anyway (the Lemming) and gets his ship primaried and popped :)
<Vordox> FLASH IS GOOD. :[
<Vordox> Flash CREATED MLP FIM
<oni_link> Vordox: doesnt mean we cant adapt
<noname> ^
<Alpha-Omega> True on the pony thing but little do you know that google actually created a program that converts flash into html5
<Biglaw> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oavMtUWDBTM
<Biglaw> :3
<Barbetos> Its not an issue that Flash is bad... its just HTML 5 is better
<Vordox> I'm FINE with IE dropping Flash, but Chrome, Firefox and rest won't.
<AdamTheDuck> and thus the internet is at an argument... again...
<Barbetos> I bet HTML 5 could pony better.
<oni_link> Not yet at least.
<Eddmario> I have no hinges, lock, or lid, and yet in my walls a golden treasure is hid. What am I?
<mishia> did it go down??
<Malavolent> Eddmario: Egg?
<Alpha-Omega> a heart
<mishia> wait
<mishia> stream over?
<Vordox> You know
*Eddmario throws an egg at Malavolent
<Vordox> You remove Flash, you remove 40% of the internet
<Lunar_Brony> I just played "CMC Beep Beep" over and over again to get every single other song out of my head. Atleast I dont' mind that one on endless loop
<Vordox> You really want to see the world Burn?
<Poly|Manhwa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_jmDscGi7E
<Poly|Manhwa> :)
<Vordox> This include things like Newgrounds, Fan animations, etc etc.
<Lunar_Brony> "Some men just want to watch the world burn."
<Malavolent> Eddmario: That wasn't very nice.
<Alpha-Omega> Not really but we all need an update evry now and then
<Vordox> All these ART(yes ART; Flash is JUST NOT A PROGRAM, it's an art style, like FiM)
<Eddmario> 4 stallions are in a boat on a lake. Suddenly, the boat tips over and they all fall into the lake, yet not a single pony got wet. How is this possible?
<oni_link> Vordox: thats why you wait til people have moved to HTML5 and not cut them off cold turkey. If they cut them off cold turkey then yeah, there would be a bit of a downfall.
<Poly|Manhwa> A stallion is a pony?
<Vordox> oni_link: But that'st he thing, Microsoft is going to nto support Flash
<Vordox> They ARE cutting it off
<Lunar_Brony> a stallion is a male pony
<Lunar_Brony> your case is invalid
<Vordox> I'll never turn to IE, no matter what they say, as long as Chrome and Firefox supports Flash. I'm fine.
<Alpha-Omega> I'm sure they will change eventually I'm not saying do it all at once.
<Poly|Manhwa> I'm saying there were no ponies on that boat.
<Vordox> next Windows doesn't support Flash
<Eddmario> Vordox: Are you answering my riddle?
<Soul> im using IE right now :P
<Lunar_Brony> Vordox IKR? The only good I find in IE is downloading a new browser
<oni_link> Vordox: ... Darn. I was unaware of that. I do love me Flash animations but thats going to suck bad if its true...
<Vordox> Next WINDOWS <---- WINDOWS does not support
*Biglaw is songing trololo song
<Alpha-Omega> Ueah I use Google chrome and Firefox
<Alpha-Omega> yeah
*Biglaw singing*
<oni_link> Lunar_Brony: Lol me too
<mishia> zomg school starts in a week
<Vordox> So if you get Winows 8...
<Eddmario> Lunar_Brony: And it's a good temporary browser for when the newest Flash player update doesn't work with FireFox
*Soul sits in a dark corner
<Vordox> ><
<Lunar_Brony> mishia I get another month
<mishia> Im having a small freakout *SQQQQQQQQQQQUEEEEEEK*
<Eddmario> You guys never answered the riddle.
<oni_link> Eddmario: yeah thats true too. It got good again.
<Lunar_Brony> Eddmario WWWWHHHHAAAAAATTTTTT?!?!?!?!?
<Poly|Manhwa> Eddmario, you kidding?
<mishia> NNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGH
<oni_link> theres just better things out now
<mishia> D:
<Barbetos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Wytn-_MSBo best version of trololol
<Lunar_Brony> wait . . . crap! Not you Eddmario!
<Eddmario> Lunar_Brony, Poly|Manhwa: FireFox > IE > Chrome
<Lunar_Brony> no, I was right the first time
<Poly|Manhwa> So?
<Eddmario> Lunar_Brony: Nope. The answer was that they were all married. I said not a SINGLE pony got wet.
<Poly|Manhwa> Blah.
<Lunar_Brony> Eddmario huh
<Alpha-Omega> thats cool
<Eddmario> The ones that were married did.
<Vordox> Anyone talked to nebula Brony lately?
<Soul> im using IE right now, what is wrong with it? :<
<Vordox> <.<
<Lunar_Brony> anyway, Explain the nonsense about Firefox not supporting the next flash!
<Poly|Manhwa> You'll find out.
<Alpha-Omega> if they all fell in they were all married
<Eddmario> Lunar_Brony: The newest flash player update had problems with FireFox
<Poly|Manhwa> I made the switch to Firefox from IE because My Little Face When didn't work with IE :P
<Soul> as long as i can get around the internet, im fine :P
<Eddmario> I finally gave in to FireFox from IE becuase I was using a 10 year old computer that was running XP and no antivirus program could protect it
<Alpha-Omega> I switched to chrome bevause mozilla was being a pain
<Poly|Manhwa> Also, yeah. Firefox and the newest version of Flash seem to have a... turbulent relationship.
<Lunar_Brony> Eddmario when was it updated? 'Cause most of the time when I was at the computer I was here, and I only got normal stream lag
<oni_link> Eddmario: Not even AVG?
<Eddmario> Lunar_Brony: A couple of weeks ago
<Eddmario> Luckily, all you had to do was go to the FireFox website and download the newest version
<Lunar_Brony> Eddmario oh, I've seen no difference. The odd bit of lag here, buffer there, but nothing out of the ordinary
<Eddmario> Lunar_Brony: Which version are you using?
<Lunar_Brony> Eddmario Firefox or Flash?
<Lunar_Brony> and how do I check either?
<Eddmario> Lunar_Brony: FireFox
<Lunar_Brony> where do I go to check it?
<Alpha-Omega> Will now start daydreaming
*Lunar_Brony throws a muffin at Alpha-Omega
<Eddmario> Lunar_Brony: Click on "Help" and choose "About FireFox"
<Lunar_Brony> k
<Lunar_Brony> 14.0.1
<Alpha-Omega> That kind of startled me as I get very inyense daydreams
<Alpha-Omega> intense
<Lunar_Brony> Alpha-Omega just STFU and eat the muffin
<Lunar_Brony> it's chocolate chip
<Alpha-Omega> :$ okay
<Barbetos> WHOA.
<Eddmario> Ah, that's why you didn't have the problems. For some reason, FireFox won't automatically update, and instead will tell me there's a new update and ask me if I want to install it, and when I chooe "Yes", it takes foreve to connect to the server
<Vordox> DAMNIT
<Lunar_Brony> Barbetos WHAT
<Vordox> Why can't I get this to work
<Vordox> D:
<Vordox> http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/82/codesm.jpg

<Eddmario> CECtheRonin: We all jack off to cartoon horses and want to have sex with them

<dalekkahn> This track rocks so much
<Biglaw> Seven Seas of Rhye!
<OtakuTom> So yea, I'm still trying to (slowly) watch this video of a guy playing Slender...I think I'm just as scared to watch the video as I would be if I were to ever play it...lol
*Biglaw wants to sing, but it's 5AM
<Emmie> :D
<dalekkahn> I know that feel Biglaw
<Biglaw> Friendship Cannon?
<Biglaw> I saw that in the list
<OtakuTom> And yes, I'm able to multi-task and watch multiple videos. I still have KSP playing here :P
<BronyInstrumental> OtakuTom: i played slender, idk what all the hype's about, it wasn't that scary to me :$
<Phase4> 00,02now this rocket has a few bugs
<Phase4> 00,02Biglaw, you did
<Biglaw> mmhm
<Emmie> Bronyinstrumental it was sooo scary D: i played it in the dark
<Mutterguy> Oh do I like to beside the seaside!
<Biglaw> This, this will end badly
<Biglaw> :I
<Emmie> :D
<Phase4> 00,02salmer says the rocket broke
<Emmie> salmer is creeper
<Mutterguy> dats a big bug
<Emmie> *creepy
<Biglaw> They lived, that's what matters
<Emmie> ewww his head
<Emmie> D:
<Emmie> but hes an astronaut
<Emmie> good for him
<Mutterguy> raddddddio
<AdamTheDuck> Why am I suddenly deaf in the right ear?
<scottish-geeky> whaer did mahboi777 go
<Biglaw> I know that feel AdamTheDuck
<Emmie> adamtheduck i just noticed that
<OtakuTom> I think it depends on what scares you. Personally, I'm terrible with jump scares, to the point where even things that aren't supposed to be scary will scare me. One good example is in the first X-Men movie, when Wolverine is unconcious and is stuck with a needle. When he jumps up to confront the person sticking him with the needle, I jumped out of my seat in the theater.
<Biglaw> O.O
<Emmie> otakutom if a duck popped out with screaming i honestly would die
<Emmie> but then start laughing xD
*AdamTheDuck pops out and scares Emmie
*Emmie dies
<Biglaw> .....
<Biglaw> :(
<Phase4> 00,02theres nowhere to mount these tanks
<OtakuTom> So yea, for me, jump scares like the ones in Slender really get me.
<Emmie> me too man
<Emmie> amnesia was bad too
<Biglaw> Pfffft, Amnesia custom stories
<Biglaw> I watch PewDie play em
<MadSurge> All we hear is Radio Gaga, Radio Googoo, Radio Gaga!
<BronyInstrumental> i've never played amnesia
<Emmie> dont, bronyinstrumental
<Phase4> 00,02brb
<OtakuTom> I was able to watch a playthrough of Amnesia, and honestly I don't think it was as bad as Slender would be on my scare factor.
<Biglaw> BronyInstrumental: Play it :3
<Emmie> otakutom, just expierience it in the dark XD
<BronyInstrumental> i've played paranormal, though
<Emmie> i was with my boyfriend and he didnt think it was scary
<Emmie> and i /died every five seconds
<MadSurge> OtakuTom: jumpscares get me too, but Slender looks very amateurish .__,
<Emmie> madsurge slenderman is amateurish
<Emmie> slender isnt
<Emmie> i dont think ^^
<scottish-geeky> im a go nite evry pony
<Biglaw> night scottish-geeky!
<Emmie> good night scottish geeky
<AdamTheDuck> Night scottish-geeky
<scottish-geeky> nite Emmie
<scottish-geeky> nite Biglaw
<BronyInstrumental> night, scottish-geeky
<scottish-geeky> nite AdamTheDuck
<scottish-geeky> nite BronyInstrumental
<Emmie> bronyinstrumental what instruments do you play?
<OtakuTom> Slender is an indie game, but the atmosphere is still there. The in-game models don't look the best, but the fact that you start in the middle of a dark forest with no idea what's going on with a flashlight that you have to pay close attention to really adds to the suspense, much like the tinder boxes and oil in Amnesia
<BronyInstrumental> Emmie quite a few :)
<Emmie> just out of curiousity. i play ukulele and bass but nothing besides that..
<Biglaw> I enjoy playing bass
<Emmie> i was the bassist in my high school orchestra
<Emmie> but i mostly play bass*guitar*
<Mutterguy> innuendo i think
<Biglaw> I'd play electric if I had a pick :I
<Emmie> i dont use a pick
<dalekkahn> I used to play trumpet
<Emmie> you get used to it though
<BronyInstrumental> i play the guitar, bass, drums (very badly), the Cello( not in 6 years, don't remember how to anymore :D) and i sing
<Emmie> i have pretty small hands but my fingers callused and it felt better.
<Biglaw> I can sing ^-^
<Emmie> and thats cool! you should make youtube videos, bronyinstrumental.
<BronyInstrumental> Emmie: naaw i don't think so ^_^
<OtakuTom> I was the percussion guru in high school. While there were others that were incredible at snare drum and I was lacking there, I was the go-to guy for basically everything else, especially mallet instruments.
<FillyMena> f
<Biglaw> I'd make my own music if I had the equipment/programs to do it
<BronyInstrumental> OtakuTom i'm basically like that in my high school but mainly for string instruments
<Emmie> how old are you guys anyways
<Biglaw> I want to play acoustic guitar
<Biglaw> 14, almost 15
<OtakuTom> I'm 26.
<Mutterguy> OtakuTom what was your prefered weapon. glockenspiel of xylophone?
<Emmie> im 14 too biglaw :D
<BronyInstrumental> 14, became it in July
<Pinkies4thWall> Phase4: dat HUGEASS rocket
<Phase4> 00,02ikr
<dalekkahn> Just turned 17 recently
<Phase4> 00,02and the lower part gets the entire upper stage into orbit
<Emmie> My birthday's in november. Kinda sucks though. :/
<OtakuTom> I'm gonna say neither and go with marimba :P
<Phase4> 00,02this thing can do inter planetary
<Emmie> nothing cool happens in november
<BronyInstrumental> Biglaw: if you wanna play any kinda guitar, you gotta start with acoustic so no worries there :)
<dalekkahn> Your birthday happens Emmie! that's something cool that happens in november.
<Mutterguy> Emmie, hre Uni ends and ewe do exams :(
<Emmie> D: that sucks
<Hirro> what is this music and why do i want it?
<Emmie> and yeah, dalekkahn, everyone should celebrate my birthday! :3
<Biglaw> BronyInstrumental: I have a bass and an electric, I just want to have an acoustic because I think they sound good
<Mutterguy> which is a shame because my birthday is on the 13th
<Emmie> queen, hirro
<Biglaw> My birthday is on September 28th
<BronyInstrumental> Biglaw: so you started learning with an electric before an acoustic
<BronyInstrumental> ?
<Hirro> lol that explains a fair bit
<Mutterguy> specificallly innuendo
<Emmie> my ukulele is acoustic/electric, bronyinsstrumental. :P
<Biglaw> BronyInstrumental: No, I began with the bass, though I haven't really had any sort of lessons with it. Only a few music classes at school
<BronyInstrumental> ah
<BronyInstrumental> i could help you with that, if you wanted, Biglaw
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<Phase4> 00,02new band time
<Phase4> 00,02song sugestion?
<Emmie> SPPPACCE!! I wanna go to space!! :3 space space space space space
<Biglaw> BronyInstrumental: I'm not sure how you could
<Emmie> Phase play best coast
<Mutterguy> I think someone invented a keytarukeazoo
<Emmie> best coast is really nice
<Emmie> i love best coast
<Emmie> >3<
<BronyInstrumental> Biglaw:......skype video lessons perhaps? although i don't actually own a bass i just know how to play them
<Biglaw> Phase4 AC/DC?
<OtakuTom> I'm thinking of trying to learn the guitar again. I took lessons for a year, but the teacher was terrible. We went through only HALF of the beginners book I had (so maybe about 20 pages) in the year. He spent over half the lessons playing on his guitar.
<Pinkies4thWall> Phase4: i'd say pony song, but thats me. do what feels best
<Biglaw> BronyInstrumental: Maybe, but I got to get a skype account
<dalekkahn> red hot chili peppers would also be nice
<Biglaw> Or maybe Green Day?
<Emmie> phase4 BEST COAST OR STEPDAD COME ON X3
<Wrek> 05so my sister has her boyfriend over this week, and yesterday they made meat and potato pie
<Biglaw> Wrek THAT SOUNDS DELICIOUS
<Emmie> ...that sounds delicious
*Biglaw is hungry
<Wrek> 05there was a little left over which i had for breakfast
<Wrek> 05fucking delicious
*Emmie has been too lazy to get food
<BronyInstrumental> Biglaw: if we did do that all i'd have to do was tune my guitar down an octave and disredard the top E and G strings
*Biglaw is drooling
<BronyInstrumental> hi Wrek!
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'd say it was, though I'd disagree, considwering I'm vegetarian
<Mutterguy> Wrek shepards pie? it's mince with mash potatoe on top
<Emmie> very_silly_filly, i wish i could be a vegan/vegetarian..i just cant bring myself to! :(
<Mutterguy> -no pastry
<Emmie> PHASE4 PLAY BEST COAAST
<Wrek> 05no but it was meat mixed with mash potatoes as filling.
<Emmie> BEST COASTTT
<Emmie> aw.
<Wrek> 05then gravy on the side
<Biglaw> BronyInstrumental: sounds good, I guess
<Biglaw> :)
<Wrek> 05also Very_Silly_Filly: then you'll love my mozarella tomato pizza :3
<Mutterguy> Daftpunk
*dalekkahn enjoys AC/DC
<Emmie> wrek stoppit >-<
<Emmie> im so hungry but its 5am
<Very_Silly_Filly> Wrek: So basically, a cheesy pizza?
<Mutterguy> nope
<BronyInstrumental> Biglaw: although i don't actually know any songs on the bass, all i really need to do is tell you how to read TABs with all the symbols and stuff. that's all you really need to know
*Biglaw now wants pizza and shepards pie
<killerpony7733> Wrek: I'm such a noodle eater, Do you know of a brand called Cup Noodles?
<Biglaw> BronyInstrumental: I just play songs by ear
<Emmie> yay :D i love best coast
<Wrek> 05yeah. prefer ramen though
<Very_Silly_Filly> Probably would, considering pizza is one of my favourite foods, near cake
*Mutterguy would fail at never mind the buzzcocks
<Emmie> fuck i want ramen noodles
<BronyInstrumental> Biglaw: oh. can't really help you there then, i can't work stuff out by ear. sorry! :$
<killerpony7733> Wrek: I guess never had those before, But yeah i usually eat noodle soups from that brand, A great and easy way of getting filled up
<Emmie> biglaw, if you'd like, i could help you with bass?
<Emmie> i play bass guitar, if that helps
<Emmie> i just dont have an amp right now.
<Biglaw> BronyInstrumental: It's alright, all I need to do is practice :)
<Wrek> 05its basicalyl the same but without the cup
<Emmie> cup-o-noodles x33
<Biglaw> My dad plays bass, and he's missing his ring finger
<Wrek> 05i tend to buy a chicken fillet that i slice and fry up to have with ym noodles
*Biglaw 's dad is a boss
<Emmie> i wish i could cook :/
<Wrek> 05then some mixes vegetables in form of corn, peppers, maybe broccoli
<Biglaw> Wrek you're making me hungry
<Biglaw> :I
<dalekkahn> I still havn't figured out a good way to eat tofu with ramen, but if there is a low preparation way I need to learn it for college
<Wrek> 05and ofc spicing up the spice bag with soem extra curry, chili and mild pepper
<Mutterguy> Phase4, that's a hell lot of fuel you have left
<Phase4> 00,02Mutterguy, ikr
<Phase4> 00,02this thing is HUGE
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Knows his rockets
<Emmie> biglaw i use my middle and ring finger to play , so that'd suck
<Emmie> phas4 SAVE LUNA!!!
<Emmie> D:
<BronyInstrumental> I use a pick. even for bass. it's kinda awkward on a bass but i only ever need to do it in school so i can deal with it
<Emmie> you use a pick for double bass, bronyinstrumental?
<Emmie> :O
<alexxm> hey guys
<Emmie> hay alexxm!~
<Wrek> 05but yeah
<BronyInstrumental> Emmie: not double bass, electric :D
<BronyInstrumental> hey alexxm!
<Wrek> 05right now a cup of tea was perfect
<Emmie> OH LOL xD that'd be so weird bronyinstrumental
<alexxm> hey Emmie and BronyInstrumental how've you been
<Emmie> pretty good, alexxm
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Drinking anything hot right now would be a death sin, It's extremely hot here
<BronyInstrumental> i'm good alexxm
<Emmie> its coolish here
<Emmie> where do you guys live?
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: Tea is always a good thing.

<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: Air con, man.

<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Lucky, I live in a small small apartment with three family members with no air con
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: Oh. That's a shame.
<Emmie> buffer
<BronyInstrumental> wait, by 'tea' do americans mean ice tea? i never understood that
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Though i do have a air blower of sorts at the highest speed blowing air at me,
<Mutterguy> damn, usually you have heaps of rcds
<Emmie> OWOWOWOW
<Mutterguy> *rcs
<Emmie> omg
<Emmie> that hurt
<Biglaw> is it just me, or is the stream frozen?
<killerpony7733> Biglaw: Same
<Biglaw> okay
<Biglaw> it unfroze for about two chords
<Emmie> there its okay now biglaw
<dalekkahn> It's back for me

<Biglaw> TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<BronyInstrumental> dammit, i can't find any guitar tab for this one song i wanna learn :(
<Emmie> phase4 likes mmmbananas biglaw
<Biglaw> BronyInstrumental: which song?
<hen3ry> looks good
<Phase4> 00,02?
<BronyInstrumental> Biglaw: loverboy by you me at six
<Biglaw> cool
<Emmie> do you like mmmmmmbananas phase4?
<Biglaw> :)
<Emmie> .n.
<Phase4> 00,02busy
<dalekkahn> fase4 is expert space pilot
<alexxm> well this looks like a succesful mission
<hen3ry> That is one heavy lander. Lots of spacejunk for future Munar base.
<Biglaw> Well, he's actually descending extremely quickly, so I think he'll go boom
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Phase4: would you prefer the customary links or something else
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ?
<hen3ry> hes at less than 10 m/s
<Emmie> COME ON SAVE LUNA
<Emmie> YOU CAN DOOO IT!
<Biglaw> hen3ry: those aren't meters
<hen3ry> no lander legs tho, so he has to do it at less than 2.
<hen3ry> yes, they are meters.
<BronyInstrumental> deliver luna her cookies :3
<Biglaw> ooooh
<Biglaw> my bad
<alexxm> she'll be back on earth before she knows it
<Biglaw> /)_-
<Phase4> 00,02:/
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Noooooo!
<Biglaw> I am such a derp
<hen3ry> doh
<Flyboy> hi Phase4
<Biglaw> XD
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not sure how to fix this rocket
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> :D
<hen3ry> epic
<Biglaw> XD
<noname> boom
<hen3ry> Phase - legs might help a bit
<Emmie> noOOOOO!
<Biglaw> I KNEW IT!!!!
<alexxm> that could have gone better
<BronyInstrumental> luna didn't get her cookies :(
<dalekkahn> Two sets of landing legs might work
<hen3ry> other than that it looked like a pretty good job really
<Biglaw> hen3ry: I was right :3
<Flyboy> buffer
<hen3ry> he didn't crash because of too fast tho. He crashed because too topheavy
<dalekkahn> no buffer for me
<Flyboy> strange...
<Emmie> buffer
<hen3ry> if the ground had been perfectly level, it would have been safe landing. But something that heavy, any slope will kill
<Emmie> anyone else getting lag?
<Flyboy> i just refreshed and now the stream is gone completely 6_9
<hen3ry> aye
<Biglaw> Eeyup
<Phase4> 00,02um
<Biglaw> ?
<Flyboy> Phase4: you crashed it didnt you :D
<hen3ry> of course, to be fair, my home network right now is being bombarded and overwhelmed.
<Biglaw> by?
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, not topheavy
<Phase4> 00,02just too heavy
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, i did a bit
<hen3ry> by file transfers between my computers.
<Phase4> 00,02i think my internet is derping
<Biglaw> aaand
<Flyboy> there we go
<Biglaw> it's back
<hen3ry> suddenly OP
<BronyInstrumental> fraaaance
<SploogeTheFish> Hello everypony

<BronyInstrumental> hi SploogeTheFish
<Biglaw> SploogeTheFish: it's 5:52 in ontario
<killerpony7733> SploogeTheFish: 11:53 AM here
<SploogeTheFish> What is going on right now?
<Flyboy> Phase5: you like ponies? you disgust me....
<hen3ry> and yes, too topheavy, Phase. To land on wide variety of terrain, you need low center of gravity, or very wide set of landers. You had neither.
<killerpony7733> winter wrap up :O

<Emmie> Pretty good for the last hour ^^
<Emmie> I uploaded a video on my youtube
<Kammerjunk> Pretty shite for the one before that?
<killerpony7733> Emmie: Oi
<Kammerjunk> before the one*
<Emmie> http://www.youtube.com/user/8BitEmmie
<Emmie> If anyone wants to check it out :/
<killerpony7733> Emmie: ........
<Kammerjunk> Wait, I just realised I have no idea what I said.
<Emmie> <_<
<Kammerjunk> Emmie: Sure, but there's a stream going on right now.
<Emmie> >_>
<Emmie> I know, Kammerjunk, I'm not forcing anyone. XD
<killerpony7733> Emmie: Ask a mod and plus it's youtube so that's a bit silly of you :D
<Kammerjunk> Emmie: Yeah, but no video links when stream.
<killerpony7733> Emmie: Youtube links=not allowed during streams+advertising so yeah :(
<Emmie> Kammerjunk Oh. Sorry D: Noone click it
<Kammerjunk> Too late! Ha ha!
<Emmie> -.-
<Emmie> hai.
<Kammerjunk> Emmie: I'm posting and you can't stop me.
<killerpony7733> Emmie: You sound either very young or you are girl with a kid like voice
<killerpony7733> :D
<Emmie> I just have a high voice D:
<Emmie> I'm 14, though
<Kammerjunk> I wish my voice was higher. People can't understand what the hell I say.
<Emmie> well i sound like a 5-year-old girl =n=
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: I kinda have a light deep ish voice, But anything that says high notes or something like that i simply can't
<alexxm> best retcon explantion ever "well there is"
<killerpony7733> Emmie: I can easily understand why though, It closely resembles one
<Emmie> killerpony7733 resembles what? a 5-year-old?
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: I cringe when I hear myself imitate a girl, but HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA is so fun to sing.
<Kammerjunk> And strangely easy.
<killerpony7733> Emmie: A girl around the age of 10 or so,
<Emmie> D: well that sucks
<Emmie> do i sound annoying?
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: I can however make really creepy voices
<Emmie> im pretty insecure about my voice though, i was talking slightly higher than i normally do
<killerpony7733> Emmie: Not really, As long as you don't talk extremely randomly should be k
<Mutterguy> Kammerjunk, best thing do to is the Women from the Spam sketch
<Emmie> just because i hate hearing myself talk
<Kammerjunk> Emmie: I wouldn't say you sound annoying.
<Mutterguy> 'I DON'T LIKE SPAM!'
<Kammerjunk> Mutterguy: That sketch is awesome.
<Emmie> the video's out of sync anyway D:
<Emmie> im thinking about deleting it
<Emmie> and re-uploading it with the pitch lowered slightly in audicity
*Vordox ponders if he could ever take over and play Touhou 1-13... <.<
<Emmie> =n=''
<Kammerjunk> Emmie: You still won't be able to stop me from posting.
<Emmie> posting what, kammerjunk?
<Kammerjunk> Emmie: Posting in brepid ead.
<Emmie> oic.
<Emmie> whats brepid ead <-<
<alexxm> Vordox are the touhou games good
<Kammerjunk> Emmie: Also, you should probably reupload anyway, since syncing is silly.
<Vordox> alexxm: They are good if you like challene
<Vordox> And memory
<Vordox> And torture
<Vordox> And abuse
<Kammerjunk> Emmie: I honestly have no idea what brepid ead is.
<Emmie> i thought it was a thing, kammerjunk
<alexxm> Vordox oh yeah they're bullet hell games aren't they
<Emmie> yeah, ill re-upload
<Vordox> alexxm: Very much so
<Emmie> brbrbrbrzles
<Roboham89> whatup
<Kammerjunk> Here's a little secret: The Earth is round. THERE IS NO UP OR DOWN.
<RoboGerbil> there is up and down
<Kammerjunk> No, because the Earth is round.
<String_Shredder> Kammerjunk: but there is this way and that way
<RoboGerbil> up and down is relative, but there definately is
<Kammerjunk> Well, yeah, there's this way and that way and all around directions, but no up and down.
<Kammerjunk> (It's a Pinkie Pie quote, guys)
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: Pinkie at her best /)
<Kammerjunk> (\
<RoboGerbil> so what are we watching?
<Kammerjunk> Concerts and stuff.
<TrixieMuffins> Epicness
<RoboGerbil> they should wear more black
<alexxm> is the chat ded
<RoboGerbil> yeh.. no one ever chats when music is playing
<Mutterguy> Kammerjunk, Due to the effects of gravity, i politely disagree
<Kammerjunk> Mutterguy: You're telling me a Pinkie Pie quote is wrong because gravity.
<Kammerjunk> Emphasis on Pinkie Pie.
<Mutterguy> yes because we're on Earth, not Equestria
<Emmie> kammerjunk im embarressed nao ;n;
<alexxm> screw physics its pinkie pie
<Kammerjunk> Mutterguy: ...Yeah?
<Emmie> how young do i sound?
<Mutterguy> different physics man!!!!
<Kammerjunk> Mutterguy: It's Pinkie Pie, man!
<Kammerjunk> She don't give a damn!
<Kammerjunk> Emmie: I wouldn't know. I mean, I know some girls at my age who sound like that.
<Mutterguy> yes but I'm saying Equestrian reality permits her to all those crazy things. here she'd just land flat on her bottom! with a cute little squeak
<Emmie> kammerjunk oh. okay. ;) at least i dont sound manly.
<Mutterguy> *do
<Kammerjunk> Mutterguy: But she still breaks the 4th wall.
<Mutterguy> then clearly she's surpassed mortality and is thus a goddess
<Mutterguy> I'll get the candles
<Kammerjunk> Mutterguy: All hail the Pink?
<Mutterguy> Iunno we might need to work on that...
<Mutterguy> 'may her smile be upon you'?
<Kammerjunk> Yes, I like that.
<Vordox> YES
<Vordox> FINALLY
<Vordox> PROGRESS
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Vordox.
<Mutterguy> suitably reverent I guess?
<Vordox> Hai Kammerjunk
<Vordox> I finally solved something in flash...
<Vordox> MIRACLEZ
<Vordox> .... wtf kick? =P
<Vordox> How many kicks before ban?
<Kammerjunk> I don't even know if that's enabled.
<alexxm> i think its 3 kicks in 10 minutes Vordox
<Vordox> Oh I should be fine then
<Mutterguy> None. they're just score keeping i think
<alexxm> thats at least what it was when i started coming here Vordox
<Mutterguy> or has that changed?
<Vordox> If I get banned from here even once, I'll not come back. ._.
<Kammerjunk> They totally are competing for kicks.
<Vordox> I should have been asleep for 8 hours ago...
<Vordox> ._. What am I doing with myself.
<Mutterguy> bet theyy have a score sheet and everything
<Mutterguy> you were passing the night trying to get flash to work.
<Vordox> Mutterguy: Oh yeah

<Mutterguy> crap it seems so far the gregorian chanting and pinky pie has to equal Cupcakes
<herostar_Discorded> alexxm it wasnt that bad. im thinking of recording it or streaming it if anypony
<herostar_Discorded> 'is interested
<herostar_Discorded> record slender for bronystate. that would be sweet :P
<herostar_Discorded> it would be so much easier to stream it, my rec. system only goes for 10 minutes :(
<Starchaser> yay my commission is done
<alexxm> what concert is this
<TrixieMuffins> Wohoooooo Blind Guardian!
<killerpony7733> Starchaser: Oh what type?
<Hrafn> I hear Nightfall in Middle Earth :O
<Starchaser> http://unitoone.deviantart.com/#/d58lh8y
<killerpony7733> Starchaser: That's pretty cool
*Hrafn approves very much of this
<SlurryMoon> 3well, good news and bad news. I found a copy of the Poirot anime finally. At least one with seeds. But the thing is... this one has the most amount of seeds I've found on the internet, which is 1. It has one seed.
<Starchaser> jumping up and down
<SlurryMoon> 3oh, now it has 2, ain't that lovely
<alexxm> what does that mean SlurryMoon
<Starchaser> first power metal band i found
<SlurryMoon> 3good thing I have a relatively fast internet, should take 8 hours to finish downloading
<SlurryMoon> 3And honestly, I don't know the definition of Seeds in torrenting programs
<Hrafn> I used to listen a LOT to this band :)
<AndroUser2> I haz returned. :3
<SlurryMoon> 3it just seems that the more you have, the faster it downloads
<TrixieMuffins> a seed is a guy uploading the stuff you want , the more there are the faster/more reliably you can download the whole thing
<Mutterguy> sigh! Luna gets Gregorian chant but Pinkie doesn't!
<Hrafn> SlurryMoon: a seeder is a person who has finished downloading the whole torrent and keeps it running so others can download from them, I think
*Mutterguy flips a table
<SlurryMoon> 3anyway, I'm going to take a nap. If LunaTheBeloved comes online, tell her to shoot me an email.
<Hrafn> take carey SlurryMoon

<Jim> I find it funny that a lot of people find it from that video or the derpy reaction video
<allponiesarebestponi> i watch it like all the time so i finally decided to come and check the site out
<Jim> I did a google search for brony streams or something
<RD4Life> i just searched brony in google
<BronyJenkins-> I found Bronystate via yahoo answers. XD
<AdamTheDuck> BronyJenkins-: lol yeah pretty much from Ballad of the Brony as werll
<killerpony7733> BronyJenkins-: Think it was either ballad of the brony of something like that, But i believe i peeked in around bronystate before 2012
<MegaMoonShine> I first came here to watch the season finale live
<BronyJenkins-> Awesome.
<Bacon[Hazard]> sweet
<MegaMoonShine> Best day ever! :$

<Jim> it was madness
<MegaMoonShine> Ikr Jim :D
<RD4Life> omg the explosion during derpy
<BronyJenkins-> I asked on yahoo where to watch episode streams.
<Bacon[Hazard]> When I found this site, I was like: "Then he started doin' like, the HUSTLE." *does the hustle*
<allponiesarebestponi> they should try to get Rainbowdash's "so awesome face on the smiley button
<Jim> Funny how it's commonly refered to "The Derpy Episode" while it's in reality is an AJ episode
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03We get 5 seconds of screen time from the Ballad, and people think we are cool :D
<Bacon[Hazard]> We ARE cool.
<allponiesarebestponi> lol

<RD4Life> just me or did anypony else want mare do well to be luna to teach RBD a lesson in humility?
<killerpony7733> RD4Life: If someone mentioned R34 you would notice, If people discuss it here they usually get a warning so don't expect it here
<Bacon[Hazard]> Lil_B: very smooth animation
<Lil_B> Bacon[Hazard] 50 frames XD
<Emmie> I tried animating my friends OC Shortcake: http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/093/f/7/shortcake_blink_gif_by_emeely-d4uxvl4.gif
<Bacon[Hazard]> RD4Life: would have been a twist
<killerpony7733> Lil_B: Can you actually make OC sprites?
<killerpony7733> a*
<Bacon[Hazard]> Lil_B: well, thats a ton (is it? i don't know?)
<Jim> blinky blinky :P
<Lil_B> killerpony7733 I can make a a spire, but not a whole animation, thats too much work at the moment
<Bacon[Hazard]> Emmie cool
<killerpony7733> Lil_B: Ah, I would do anything for getting a sprite of my OC >_<
<Lil_B> Bacon[Hazard] yes, thats a longer animation for a Desktop Pony I think
<RD4Life> are all the chats connected? cause i havent noticed a difference between theaters
<Bacon[Hazard]> i think it is too
<AdamTheDuck> RD4Life: THey're only used during movies
<MegaMoonShine> Or during new episodes
<RD4Life> oh thats it then.
<killerpony7733> RD4Life: Nope, Side channels are open during movie nights, Else other channels can only be joined if you find them on a channel list
<AdamTheDuck> Well I'm beat, time to hit the hay. Night guys :)
<Lil_B> Bacon[Hazard] But I think Wrek's OC for example has 50 frams just for sitting and puffing the ciggaret
<herostar_Discorded> my ew rec software disagrees with slender v_v cant record it and i've tried twice...
<MegaMoonShine> Night AdamTheDuck :)
<herostar_Discorded> i think i've soiled myself enough...
<Bacon[Hazard]> Lil_B: i need to get into animation and drawing v.v
<RD4Life> all the links to download are broken
<killerpony7733> RD4Life: links to what?
<RD4Life> slender
<killerpony7733> Oh
<Lil_B> Bacon[Hazard] making the animation is a lot of work, but the hard part is learning the programms :/
<herostar_Discorded> RD4Life add Herostar_Discorded on skype and i can send it to ya, it'sa zip file
<RD4Life> i would first have to make a skype account
<Bacon[Hazard]> Lil_B: "I hate software."
<herostar_Discorded> -_- why don't people have skype these days?
<killerpony7733> Anyway, Think i'll take a match of Tribes Ascend quick or something also herostar_Discorded I got skype :P
<MadSurge> Why is everyone so excited about Slender? Ghoul's Forest games were better :D
<RD4Life> cause im convinced my laptop is just a glorified toaster
<herostar_Discorded> MadSurge cause slender was alot more subtle about their scares, it wasn't "ohhai ima eat your face and you cant do shit"
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Meh, It's like amnesia people liked it due to the fact you have no way to fight and you gotta think and be careful
<RD4Life> skype teamspeak disagree with them. vent works great though
<Lil_B> Bacon[Hazard] actually you can just Use GIMP for everything, but you'll have to find out EVERYTHING GIMP can do :/ I may search for a better solution later, maybe check some topics about how other people make Desktop Ponies
<killerpony7733> Anyway's quick match of tribes ascend for me now, Brb in a bit everypony
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: think? All I've seen was "get paper, run like a beheaded chicken :D"
<Bacon[Hazard]> Lil_B: "But I want it NOOOOOOWW"
<Lil_B> Bacon[Hazard] NO!.jpeg
<herostar_Discorded> Bacon[Hazard] that made me feel better after 1 hour straight of slender ^^

<rdash> There, now Jayden's bot should do good in here
<killerpony7733> Yay for MIRV spamming jugg indoors in tribes :D
<rdash> !eastern
<`Celestia`> rdash - [Eastern Daylight Time]: Wednesday, July 25, 2012, 10:33:08 AM
<allponiesarebestponi> what are bots :P
<rdash> yep, she still works
<rdash> a bot is a piece of software, designed to connect to an irc server that does whatever you want
<rdash> from sending/receiving memos, games, you name it
<rdash> `Celestia` is no exception
<killerpony7733> Hardly a AI however
<allponiesarebestponi> oh thanks:)
<rdash> at 3:00pm EDT, it will auto change to `Luna`
<Very_Silly_Filly> killerpony7733: It is an AI
<Very_Silly_Filly> As it has intellegence, it has the intellegence to do what you program it to do
<herostar_Discorded> if i learn to make desktop ponies and enjoy it, would i get asked to do custom ponies?
<rdash> If i do a quick config edit of this bot and add #bronystate to the channel autojoin list, I can restart the bot, and have `Derpy` join too, which is the mail bot
<killerpony7733> Imagine having a fully fledged AI able to think and do things, Very_Silly_Filly In that regard this, But as in real thinking etc? nope
<allponiesarebestponi> that painter must work for equestria daily
<rdash> you can send and receive messages with it
<Lil_B> herostar_Discorded probably :/
<Very_Silly_Filly> killerpony7733: You'll have to program it to think
<herostar_Discorded> Lil_B i'm learning right now :3
<allponiesarebestponi> so basically its a ai that can get into personal buissness or am i over thinking this
<Lil_B> herostar_Discorded I learned it 2 weeks agon :§ someone was kind anough to offer his time to teach me :)
<killerpony7733> Very_Silly_Filly: *facehoof* It can't think litterally it works in a set of commands and prorities, It cannot work outside that and adapt like humans would
<Lil_B> herostar_Discorded whats your method?
<herostar_Discorded> brb everypony, im going ona quest to make a desktop pony...
<herostar_Discorded> adobe cs4, what the tutorial on the site is recommending
<allponiesarebestponi> what band is this?
<rdash> 11,1 TO OPS: 0 You guys don't mind that being in here I hope? If you want it out, I'll make it leave
<Lil_B> herostar_Discorded can you give this site real quick before you go?
<herostar_Discorded> yeah, cs4 isn't free..
<herostar_Discorded> plan = shot down untill i get a backup
<Lil_B> herostar_Discorded I mean the tutorial
<killerpony7733> rdash: Think most mods are not exactly here atm, wrek is having a nap and heck if i know about the others
<rdash> ah, mustve missed the colors portion of the rules >_<
<rdash> ooops
<herostar_Discorded> send me a link, if it's free, i'll try it
<shana> rdash: bots are not allowed, http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
<rdash> !leave
<rdash> shana: thanks for the heads up... I havent quite gotten that far yet... still new here >_>
<rdash> i better read them before i get in trouble >_<
<allponiesarebestponi> i just reread the rules and im guessing a mod is someone in charge
<shana> no problem :)
<rdash> mod = your personal god
<shana> allponiesarebestponi: it's short for moderator
<rdash> better listen or else
<killerpony7733> allponiesarebestponi: Mod is just a way of saying admin,
<allponiesarebestponi> ok thanks
<rdash> ^
<killerpony7733> allponiesarebestponi: They are both streamers and moderators of bronystate,
<allponiesarebestponi> thankds
<killerpony7733> :P
<allponiesarebestponi> stupid fingers
<MASF123> what are we watching?
<allponiesarebestponi> this band need vinyl scratch
<Jim> I miss Stephen_Magnet
<MadSurge> allponiesarebestponi: what are these... "fingers" you speak of? :D
<allponiesarebestponi> hooves soory:P
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Yes ikr? :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> MadSurge: These things. *Takes off hooves to reveal fingers*
<killerpony7733> We all have huge buttons to even type
<MadSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: BACK OFF MOLESTIA
<Very_Silly_Filly> Then again, I'm not a pony :3
<MadSurge> :D
<allponiesarebestponi> still not used to talking to bronies not many live around here
<Very_Silly_Filly> I can't use ANY of my firearms without not being a pony
<MadSurge> allponiesarebestponi: where are you from?
<Jim> allponiesarebestponi, You'd be surprised, bronies are almost everywhere
<killerpony7733> Very_Silly_Filly: Unicorns can operate guns
<allponiesarebestponi> Northeast PA aka middle of nowhere
<MASF123> Jim that is correct.
<alexxm> the only brony near where i live is probably my best friend and i had to get him into the show
<Very_Silly_Filly> But my OC is a pegasus
<killerpony7733> Very_Silly_Filly: Same gotta love pegasi <3
<Very_Silly_Filly> And the real me is HUMANZ :3
<MadSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: gun nut? Keep those things locked, plese :P
<turtlegod98> Wait, this rock thing is still going on?
<allponiesarebestponi> alexxm same here
*MASF123 is asshamed he hasn't made an OC yet
<MASF123> "ashamed"
<allponiesarebestponi> and she isnt to into the show that much
<Very_Silly_Filly> MadSurge: Don't worry, I am in perfect control of *accidently shoots gun and blows up Australia*....oops
<Very_Silly_Filly> Oh, hold on
<BronyInstrumental> my OC is an earth pony :3
<Very_Silly_Filly> That was my australia battle plan
<Jim> MASF123, lol ass hammed
<MadSurge> MASF123: I'm not ashamed :D
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: What would you use an OC for, anyway?
<MadSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: NOOO PHASE4 :D
<MASF123> Jim yeah I derped once again. :P
<killerpony7733> There seriously should be a survey one day where we count the ratio of earth/unicorn/pegasi OC's here
<Very_Silly_Filly> MadSurge: Don't worry, brah, it thankfully turned out to be a battle plan I shot
<Phase4> 00,02?
<MASF123> Kammerjunk, like a personal avatar on the web. I owuld like one.
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Hiya!
<allponiesarebestponi> what is OC
<Very_Silly_Filly> So Australia should still be here as long as I agree with "him"
<MadSurge> Phase4: nothing :D
<MegaMoonShine> allponiesarebestponi: Origina Character
<MegaMoonShine> Original*
<MASF123> would. OMFG Think before posting MASF... :/
<MadSurge> I think there are very little earth pony OCs
<allponiesarebestponi> oh ok thank you
<Jim> MASF123, You can't brain today either? I has the dumbs, you see.
<MadSurge> ^ me erryday
<rdash> ^ me constantly
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Maybe, Maybe not can't really be known but yes not that much seen
<MASF123> Jim, Sorry I cn't brain today, my think isn't working right. :P
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: I don't know what I would use one for. I don't draw art, I don't write music, I don't publish stories, I don't even use forums.
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: we can't all be modest :D
<allponiesarebestponi> Masf123 same here
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: I'm such a modest pony aren't? :$
<killerpony7733> i*
<MadSurge> I dunno :D
<allponiesarebestponi> this band need a DJ PON3
<PON3> uhh what
<MASF123> ...I think it is because I haven't slept at all today. I have to tell @SuperBrony64, that my insominia is getting worse and worse everyday.
<allponiesarebestponi> oops sorry
<allponiesarebestponi> lol
<MadSurge> I wish we will see a Gene Simmons pony one day :D
<allponiesarebestponi> :D
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: Has it been going on for weeks?
<MASF123> Kammerjunk, I just want one for like a pony ego or like a mini me or like a ponified version of myself.
*Very_Silly_Filly is playing on his 3DS
<Jim> MadSurge, Wish granted http://pulpfactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/My-little-pony-Gene-Simmons.jpg
<MadSurge> Jim:FUKKIN SAVED :D
<MadSurge> Oops
<MASF123> Oh...no Kammerjunk not for weeks. It happens occasionally. Like 3 days straight but it's not as bad as when I was younger so I can't complain.
<allponiesarebestponi> another question whats the difference between Rainbow dash theatre and the others
<MASF123> ...idk
<alexxm> allponiesarebestponi none apart from movie nights
<MadSurge> allponiesarebestponi: when there's live episodes we get split into the rooms
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: I'm not a doctor, but I'd wager that it's transient insomnia. Asides from that, it's hard to tell why.
<allponiesarebestponi> smart so one doesn't crash smart one
<MASF123> oh yeah, we can switch channels in movie night
<Jim> it's to avoid too much spam, because during the new episodes there are thousands of people here
<MadSurge> allponiesarebestponi: otherwise there would be way too many people talking in one chat
<allponiesarebestponi> again smart one
<killerpony7733> allponiesarebestponi: It's kinda like chat rooms for those that like the pony they go in,
<Jim> Think we had, what was it, 5-6k this one time?
<allponiesarebestponi> or dragon
<MASF123> I normally stick to the bronystate chat overall.
<killerpony7733> Jim: On days where new eps are streamed we are even more
<MadSurge> allponiesarebestponi: when season 3 comes out pick your favorite mane pony and get that chatroom :D
<MASF123> What is transient insomnia exactly?
<shana> allponiesarebestponi: the spike room is for people that use their own irc client
<BaconMane> 0,5Jim: For the season finale we had over 5,000 people watching
<MadSurge> ^^^
<Jim> yeah, what I thought I remembered
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: If the symptoms last less than one week, it's classified as transient insomnia.
<MadSurge> I had to pick the Spike channel to see a seamless stream :D
<allponiesarebestponi> ok thanks speaking of new episodes has anypony seen season 3 'spoilers' yet
<Jim> shush
<Jim> don't mention them
<Doobinz> I havn't
<Jim> Don't even talk about them
<MASF123> ...oh so it is like a classifed insomnia but still insomnia none-the-less I see.
<allponiesarebestponi> oh.....ok
<Jim> It's a bannable offense to talk about them here
<Jim> Seriously
<MadSurge> allponiesarebestponi: yeah, but I'm not watching them.
<killerpony7733> allponiesarebestponi: Yes, But no talk about it
<allponiesarebestponi> k soory
<killerpony7733> If spoilers are said it's a ban, :(
<allponiesarebestponi> Hooves work today
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: Well, ther's a bit of a discussion on when what is what, but generally, yeah.
<MASF123> no it's against the rules to speak of Season 3, trust me I would know.
<Doobinz> Twillight dies in season 3
<allponiesarebestponi> ^no
<MadSurge> You can talk about anything else though :D
<MadSurge> Doobinz: :D
<Jim> Actualy, don't make fake spoilers either
<MadSurge> ^ agreed
<pony_000946> Hi guys
<MASF123> Fake spoilers count as trolling also a permaban for trolling.
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, S3 is a big no-no.
<Jim> Hi pony_000946
<Kammerjunk> Hi, pony_000946.
<Jim> I've seen people banned for posting fake spoilers, so yeah, don't do that
<alexxm> hey pony_000946 how've you been
<MadSurge> hey pony_000946! Have you been here yet?
<MASF123> I've seen the Season 3 songs, so that will answer your question, but we would have to dicuss it elsewhere.
<BaconMane> 0,5Guys I must ask you a question
<Kammerjunk> Shoot.
<Jim> sure, shoot
<allponiesarebestponi> k
<MASF123> ...yeah?
<MadSurge> Go on
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Don't Shoot! D:
<BaconMane> 0,5Do you like to use "everypony" and "anypony" in sentences?
<MASF123> :O
<Kammerjunk> BaconMane: Yes, I do. It's come to the point where I have to stop myself from using them in normal conversation.
<MadSurge> BaconMane: only occasionally :D
<herostar_Discorded> BaconMane it's caused me many akward moments..
<BaconMane> 0,5I personally don't like using those words in my sentences anymore.
<pony_000946> Well, it's my first time...
<Jim> I don't really use them
<MASF123> Uh...I use them only on Bronystate and other brony related events but don't use it in everyday life.
<Kammerjunk> ^
<Kammerjunk> At least, that's what I strive for.
<Maid_Saturn> 08,01bitchtits
<Maid_Saturn> 08,01i like that word
<Kammerjunk> wat
<BaconMane> 0,5People were doing it at BronyCon
<Jim> Welcome to Bronystate pony_000946 !
<MadSurge> BaconMane: Yeah, I still use "everybody" most of the time
<herostar_Discorded> i try not to use them in life but, jeez, ponies have controlled my mind O_O
<allponiesarebestponi> pony_000946 i have meen here a few minutes now and i love it here
<pony_000946> Uh gee thanks...
<MASF123> Haha Bitchtits! :D
<Kammerjunk> I want to say "everyone" and "everybody", but it's hard to remember.
<MadSurge> Hey hey Saturn! :D

<XAX> Except MASF123, because he's on the highway to the danger zone.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> BaconMane: it must be Christmas in july, a newin' who read the rules
<Jim> MASF123 is a strong independent black woman, who don't need no rules.
<MASF123> @BaconMane, don't look at me like that, you would have done the same if you were on my shoes. :(
<killerpony7733> B-Y: All ponies are best, People just have preference. :P

<killerpony7733> ^Implying you want boobS?
<killerpony7733> lolwow
<MASF123> ...
<MadSurge> Guys, in italian Pinkie Pie eats caviar instead of fudge :D
<MASF123> This won't end well.
<Jim> Well, I was the one who attached the Bronystate logo to it
<killerpony7733> BaconMane: ninja'd me before i could do it right
<Jim> The picture was drawn by someone else
<MASF123> MadSurge, why is that?
<Wrek> 05dio is best dio
<MadSurge> MASF123: because it rhymes
<allponiesarebestponi> what was the first episode you ponies whatched
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Wb :)
<XAX> BaconMane: Im pretty sure I've seen that comic with something else on the second slide before, bit i'm probably mistaken.
<MASF123> oh...ok...I guess cavier rhymes with something in Italian?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Jim: god that is so me righ now, minus the boobs
<killerpony7733> allponiesarebestponi: Mid ish or early around ish of S1 then decided to do a marathon
<XAX> Instead of BronyState, something else on the second bit
<B-Y> I prefer the American version...
<MadSurge> MASF123: yeah, but I forgot with what :D
<BronyInstrumental> allponiesarebestponi: i watched them all in order, from S1 E1 to S2 E26
<MadSurge> B-Y: yeaaahhhhhh, although the italian dub is at least decent
<MASF123> B-Y, I perfer the American version with the Italian intro. :)
<Jim> BaconMane, The original was drawn by Adri Tibbs
<allponiesarebestponi> the episode that got me was mysterious mare do well
*Razyn noms on BaconMane
<allponiesarebestponi> then i started whaching on youtube then netflix
<MASF123> lol.
<B-Y> Well, unfortunately Season 2 isn't released in Italy yet...
<MadSurge> allponiesarebestponi: that episode is very controversial with bronies :D
<allponiesarebestponi> B-Y WHATTTTTTTTT
<XAX> I have all of the poni saved on my hard drive in 1080p :D
<MadSurge> B-Y: you italian too? :O
<MASF123> Which one? Feeling Pinkie Keen?
<B-Y> Ovviamente
<allponiesarebestponi> MadSurge Why?
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: How could it be controversial?
<XAX> ^
<MadSurge> B-Y: FINALMENTE! :D Talk only in english, please
<B-Y> Sure
<MadSurge> I mean, bronies hate it because it messes up characterization
<B-Y> after all, the rules are talking high
<MASF123> I still never understood the Feeling Pinkie Keen lesson. :/ I thought it ment that I don't have to believe there isn't a God it doesn't make it not true, you just have to believe he doesn't exist.
<XAX> MadSurge: I must rewatch. I never noticed this.
<allponiesarebestponi> ohhhhh thanks Rainbow doesnt really follow her element got it
<MASF123> But that is called, "Selective hearing."
<Jim> That wasn't what I got from that episode
<XAX> MASF123: I cannot remember anything on the spot when I want to. What one is Feeling Pinkie Keen again?
<B-Y> well, how many of you believe that those characters really exist somewhere in the universe?
<MadSurge> MASF123: I think that episode was meant to be just a "Twilight gets hurt a lot, Pinkie does funny stuff" episode :D
<Jim> Where Pinkie's tail twitches and Twilight can't explain it
<MASF123> Season1 Episode 15
<allponiesarebestponi> i think pinkie keens lesson is not to turn into Rabidash
<Jim> so she refuses to believe it
<XAX> MASF123: No. What's it about? D:
<Jim> XAX, Where Pinkie gets all these tail twitches
<MASF123> Twilight wants to prove that Pinkie's Pinkie Sense makes no sense?
<Jim> And Twilight doesn't believe her sense
<XAX> Jim: OH. that's right :|
<killerpony7733> Jim: I think the message was ''Even if you can't explain it or understand it, While some can you should atleast accept it's there just not that you believe in it''
<MadSurge> Although the lesson might be "you don't have to understand/overanalyse something to enjoy it"
<allponiesarebestponi> no just kidding i thinks it means that you dont have to judge your friends with thier beilfs
<B-Y> I guess my question had the obvious answer...
<MadSurge> allponiesarebestponi: that too
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<MASF123> That could be it MadSurge
<Jim> hai Everlasting_Joy
<FillyFlam> Dat Dio.
<FillyFlam> Also hi
<Jim> hai FillyFlam
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy FillyFlam.
<allponiesarebestponi> <<<<everypony look
<MadSurge> Hello FillyFlam!
<Everlasting_Joy> Those credits. . .
<MASF123> One guy explained that lesson and I still didn't understand it. :P
<killerpony7733> It's overall about how you should atleast show respect to those that believe in it, or even cause you can't understand or explain it,
<allponiesarebestponi> WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!
<allponiesarebestponi> is going on here
<Jim> suff
<Jim> stuff*
<XAX> Well, im personally lying in bed listening to da musiks
<Everlasting_Joy> XAX, good way of listening :).
<MASF123> It's Jesus! :O
<XAX> Everlasting_Joy: 3:20am :D
<allponiesarebestponi> the meaning of life is 42
<Jim> ^
<rdash> allponiesarebestponi: dat hitchhikers guide to the galaxy reference >_<
<rdash> lol
<MadSurge> :| Really guys? Not even translating "princess"? This dub is... not bad, but only that.
<Everlasting_Joy> XAX: And? It's still a good way of listening to it. If ya fall asleep, you're already in bed :).
<B-Y> Yeah, I remember that the names weren't dubbed...
<allponiesarebestponi> yes its totally not a random number i picked out of my head
<MASF123> What is the deal with Dio?
<XAX> Twilight Sparkles cutie mark has 42 points if you count each one on the starts. Furthermore, she wore the number 42 in the Running of the Leaves.
*Jim rocks back and forth "Soon, soon I will also be able to watch the stream again"
<B-Y> But I remember the voices...
<XAX> In conclusion, the meaning of life is Twilight Sparkle.
<killerpony7733> The meaning is life is, There is no meaning, What a person decides to live for is their own decision there is no such thing as a universal reason to live. We live because we make up our reason for it :)
<B-Y> are you doing a personality test?
<Jim> killerpony7733, The answer is 42, but what is the question?
<allponiesarebestponi> killerpony7733: good one
<XAX> Everlasting_Joy: I don't think one can fall asleep with most of the music I have on my iPod.
<MASF123> Twilight is the name of a very bad movie, the girl that dated the vampire had a sparkle in her eye! :O
<Everlasting_Joy> XAX, ditto
<allponiesarebestponi> ^ i kmow but no
<MadSurge> B-Y: by the way, come here on Saturdays. At 8 PM there's always two movies and two pony episodes chosen through mail lottery.

<killerpony7733> Jim: Hah, Still it's a serious statement, It's what i stand by in my life
<MadSurge> Jim: :D she must be confused, a lot!

<B-Y> I've a question... since I didn't yet see all the episodes: do ponies have television? They know the existance about the cartoons?
<MASF123> No they don't.
<killerpony7733> Jim: I guess, I see so much beauty in life and so much to enjoy and life for. It's how i see it and why i live a life at all :)
<Jim> They don't have television as far as I've seen
<MadSurge> B-Y: only on commercials :D not on canon
<MASF123> However....
*Bronysith rides on Jim
*Jim spins
<MASF123> Pinkie was playing a video game on a Hub commercial.

<XAX> MASF123: That video game is playable on the hub website
<MadSurge> B-Y: although they do have movies and videogames are canon :D

<allponiesarebestponi> hey guys im just wonder im making a pinkie pie costume for Holloween any tips?
<BaconMane> 0,5* 34 is best number
<MASF123> Justin Bieber is too gay to like MLP, it's like the manliest show ever made. So I don't believe it, he is lying.
<MadSurge> B-Y: where did you get with the episodes?
<BronyInstrumental> dat drumming
<Jim> allponiesarebestponi, PINK, LOTS AND LOTS OF PINK

<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy valoreins!
<SuperSanjitenks1989> Wow!
<Bronysith> valoreins: but not a good celebrity
<Bronysith> brb
<SuperSanjitenks1989> What band?
<Jim> valoreins, Believe it is shopped though
<valoreins> i know
<MadSurge> SuperSanjitenks1989: Dio
<MASF123> Dio apparently.
<valoreins> well, someone went to the actual tweet?
<Eulshy> 2 hours later, still music
<MASF123> Haha wow.
<BronyInstrumental> hi Eulshy
<allponiesarebestponi> is the paiter over there < a mare or a colt? IDK
<SuperSanjitenks1989> I'm guessing really long drum solo or he's playing Drums by The Grateful dead.
<Alchemist> I personally dont understand the rage/hate towards JB though.
<Eulshy> hi BromyInstrumental
<MadSurge> Wrek's having an intense week I think, he either works or naps
<MASF123> Alchemist, we don't hate him we are bronys, we dislike him with a huge passion.
<MadSurge> ^
<SuperSanjitenks1989> I hate him.
<allponiesarebestponi> ^ LOL
<MASF123> Lol.
<Alchemist> There were dozens of musicians with the same music style before him and people didnt hate those artists this much...
<Eulshy> well since this bores the sheist outta me, ima go so bye
<SuperSanjitenks1989> I wanna punch his face off with brass knockles.
<Everlasting_Joy> MASF123: Speak for yourself. While I don't care for his music, I certainly don't hate him.
<killerpony7733> allponiesarebestponi: What do you mean? can't understand what you are refering to
<MadSurge> Oh shit, planet suite!
<B-Y> Which of you watch My Little Pony in Real Life? I don't mean real life ponies... I mean MLP characters in our world
<valoreins> Alchemist: it was during high school i raged about JB, my junior girl classmate wont shut up about him/her, because first time i heard its song i thought it was a girl lol, but now i dont really care
<StupidSexyCJ> Good morning all
<Jim> hai StupidSexyCJ
<B-Y> hey
<SuperSanjitenks1989> Morning, sexy. mmmmmmm...
<MASF123> Alchemist, I don't hate Bieber but I would really appreciate it if he would throw in the towel.
<MadSurge> B-Y: you mean who watches them on tv?
<B-Y> no, those are youtube videos...
<Jim> I don't really hate JB, it's just how obnoxious his fans are
<MadSurge> ^
<SuperSanjitenks1989> ^ definetly
<MASF123> Justin Bieer should qiut his dayjob.
<Everlasting_Joy> valoreins: You too?! I heard some of his songs and thought a girl was singing as well. Heck, I once thought it was Mily Cyrus singing, then the DJ said "It's Justin Beiber." Needless to say, I was stunned.
<B-Y> users make characters like Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Twilight Sparkle and etc. to appear in their house
<killerpony7733> Jim: But if you had some musical insight you would know his music is plain repeating and hardly deep, It's always the same thing LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
<MASF123> quit
<BronyInstrumental> i once made an ass of myself in front of my friends by playing karaoke party with them and singing baby by JB really ass-tardedly
<MadSurge> B-Y: OH, those
<allponiesarebestponi> ^
<Alchemist> Why? You listened to his songs, you decided you dont like, why does it hurt you if he continoues to make those songs. there are very scenarios where you have NO control if you want to listen to his songs or not...
<killerpony7733> There isn't talent when you keep singing about love and having the same words constantly repeated too many times
<allponiesarebestponi> ^
<Everlasting_Joy> killerpony7733: And not even about substantial love, it's just goofy teen love.
<B-Y> Any of you guys, watch those videos? I like them!
<SuperSanjitenks1989> holy shit THIS SONG IS AWESOOOOOOOME
<valoreins> Everlasting_Joy: ikr lol :D those silly current generation singers, now in my place K-pop is trending and i'm so bored about it
<MadSurge> B-Y: fan videos are often streamed here as well
<XAX> I sung Never gonna give you up in front of my school in year 8 in assembly
<XAX> I WIN
<killerpony7733> Everlasting_Joy: Yep, It proves the point even further
<allponiesarebestponi> killerpony7733: agreed
<Jim> B-Y, One of my favourite gifs of that http://derpy.me/fASYj
<MASF123> Some people hate rap, others hate emo music, all hate Justin Bieber other than little girls, any questions?
<Everlasting_Joy> valoreins: I'd take K-pop to be honest, but I'd bet good money I'd eventually join you in boredom.
<Derpdash> Jim: D'awwwwww
<allponiesarebestponi> what does GIF even stand for never got that
<SuperSanjitenks1989> I'd rathe J-pop. especially Hibonoru Kageyama.
<Everlasting_Joy> Jim: That is one of the best pony gifs.
<Jim> .GIF is a format for imaging
<B-Y> I liked the video with Pinkie Pie coming out of the screen
<allponiesarebestponi> thanks
<Jim> often used to make moving pictures

<Everlasting_Joy> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF For all your GIF needs.
<Alchemist> allponiesarebestponi: I'd bet everyone

<BronyInstrumental> allponiesarebestponi: i LOVE the .MOV series!
<MadSurge> allponiesarebestponi: I did, but we don't discuss Pony. mov here :D
*MASF123 does not like Hot Diggity Demon or his vids.
<allponiesarebestponi> ok
<MadSurge> B-Y: you'd be wrong.
<MASF123> B-Y, they stream games a lot actually.
<killerpony7733> B-Y: Actually it's the most common thing streamed here
<B-Y> MadSurge, there are games too? Sweet
<Jim> B-Y, Games are streamed ALL the times
<B-Y> I played yesterday Super Pinkie World
<allponiesarebestponi> that bald guy kind looks like Tobuscus
<Alchemist> oh no "cupcake" discussion either
<allponiesarebestponi> without hair
<B-Y> the first, the second, the third and hard mode
<MASF123> The mods take turns, @Wrek wants to post music, others post different content.
<alexxm> B-Y is it good
<MadSurge> B-Y: :D that hack with Pinkie instead of Yoshi?
<Derpy_at_work> hai hai
<B-Y> no, MadSurge
<B-Y> It was a Flash game
<PrincessLunaNLR> Hello, everyone.
<killerpony7733> MASF123: All mods have a said list of stuff they stream and them only, Though games sometimes get streamed cause they just got it etc
<Jim> oooh, you guys got to see what just passed us by
<B-Y> You use Pinkie and you've to reach one of her friends

<MadSurge> B-Y: fangames aren't streamed too often though
<BaconMane> 0,5I heard that the beiber picture is fake anyhow

<Bronysith> BaconMane: thank sweet merciful sexy molestia that it is fake
<BronyInstrumental> these guys make me envious, their guitars are all wacky awesome shapes. mine is symmetrical :S
<valoreins> btw guys it's already 95 days since the last season finale aired! Keep your sanity high till season 3 okay guys? :D
<B-Y> I wonder if Hub will make a true MLP game...
<MadSurge> Brb guys, bike time
<B-Y> bye
<MASF123> @BAconMane it is fake, it's just an attempt to make me quit MLP and it's working!!! :O
<Jim> have fun MadSurge
<Alchemist> I wouldnt have a problem with it if it wasnt fake.
<allponiesarebestponi> B-Y: adventure ponies doesnt count
<Alchemist> He likes it? good for him...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did LC just post the JB Brony pic?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: i did a while back
<BronyInstrumental> B-Y: there's a true game made by fans, called fighting is magic but it's in really early development
*MASF123 cries
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: EA are the reapers
<Bronysith> BRB GRABBING NOMS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I call trolling.
<BronyInstrumental> hi Nittany_Discord
<B-Y> Don't change your mind only with a single pic...
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> morn Nittany_Discord
<MASF123> There is also "Legends of Equestria"
<BronyInstrumental> yeah
<killerpony7733> valoreins: Pffft easy cake,
<BronyInstrumental> and there was 'equestria online' but the team broke apart :(
<Derpy_at_work> alchemist : what are you talking about?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even then, I think love and tolerance will be thrown out the window for JB.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Personally, I couldn't care less if he became a brony or not.
<MASF123> Indeed.
<Michael> hai everypony :D
<Jim> Fighting is Magic will be best pony game
<Jim> Hai Michael
<Alchemist> Derpy_at_work: the JB pic
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Morning Spectrum_Rush|Zzz
<MASF123> MLP MIcheal!!!
<Derpy_at_work> what jb pic?
<alexxm> hey Michael how've you been
<Cuttershy> color text?
<B-Y> I'm looking foward Pony Kart
<Alchemist> Derpy_at_work: I said I wouldnt mind if it wasnt fake.
<allponiesarebestponi> ^ WHATT
<killerpony7733> BronyInstrumental: Actually game is still being made, It was shown at bronycon 2012
*Michael hugs Jim alexxm MASF123
<allponiesarebestponi> B-Y:what
<BronyInstrumental> killerpony7733: oh. didn't know that. awesome! :D
<B-Y> well... it's an another upcoming game
<allponiesarebestponi> didnt mean the link
<Michael> like legends of equestria
<B-Y> You can see Twilight Sparkle on her kart doing a practice run all over Sweet Acres
<Kammerjunk> I don't see how Legends of Equestria can work.
*Spectrum_Rush|droozy ugh
<Wrek> 05again
<Kammerjunk> I mean, how are they going to keep the servers open?
<Michael> i dunno but looks damn good
<Wrek> 05RIP DIP
<Wrek> 05DIO*
<Jim> ^
<Michael> ^^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hug Cuttershy when they come in again.
<MASF123> It looks like an MMO of MLP: FiM, how can it NOT work?!?!
<Kammerjunk> They can't charge people to play the game, so they can't get money to keep the servers open that way.
<Michael> fine :D
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: Because dosh.
<Jim> Someone's having connection issues
<allponiesarebestponi> whatch actvision is gonna make 40 first person shooters on MLP
<Michael> rly?
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Well either they have a way of getting donated money to only fund the servers or the makers fund them themselfs
<Bronysith> Wrek: i cried when i found out he died
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Call of Duty: Equestria.
<Kammerjunk> I mean, I'd understand if it was Diablo II style of multiplayer. That would be neat. But the fact of the matter is that it costs money to host stuff.
*Bronysith slaps Nittany_Discord
<valoreins> oh my..
<allponiesarebestponi> oh the unicons are so OP
<allponiesarebestponi> unicorns sorry
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: Actually, thatmay not be as un
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Maybe fans will set up servers and fund it themself if they make enough money?
<Kammerjunk> goddammitenterkey
<Jim> Call of Cutie: Modern Marefare
*Bronysith slaps Jim
<B-Y> They are making MLP games online, if I recall right...
<MASF123> Earth ponies can carry more items and run faster than unicorns or pegasi, and they are better in battle.
<XAX> Call of Cutie: Black Clops
<Jim> oh my
<Michael> lol
<allponiesarebestponi> XAX:lol
<Bronysith> ahhhhhhh yes. decline of video gaming
<killerpony7733> MASF123: Meh still love pegasi over unicorn or earth :P
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: Yeah, that's actually not as unlikely a thing. I used to play this private World of Warcraft RP server which ran on donations. Blizzard didn't give a rats arse because the donations went only to the server, and it wasn't subscription-based or anything.
<allponiesarebestponi> killerpiny7733: but all ponies are best
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If I were an indie dev, I would avoid EA and Activision like the plague if I wanted to go mainstream.
<B-Y> But Earth Ponies are actually have something that unicorns and Pegasi don't have?
<Jim> ^^
<XAX> and then Nittany_Discord
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Cuttershy
<Jim> B-Y, Knowledge and strength to harvest the earth
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: my friend asked me if i became head of EA what i would do. i said SHUT THIS FUCKER DOWN
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: So the idea of how it could work is donations for server only no funding for the team themself but servers yes
<allponiesarebestponi> @Niyany_Discord: agreed
<Cuttershy> #CuttershyFans <- go there!
<XAX> Either that, or I wasn't here when he got back because my iPod makes ALL the apps crash
<XAX> And then room advertisement
<Kammerjunk> That's because you have an iPod.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And then I have to ban him.
<killerpony7733> allponiesarebestponi: Sure, Just a pegasi person myself. I'm in forever for all
<Jim> how nice
<B-Y> so that means Pinkie Pie has... knowledge of the harvest?
<Kammerjunk> Why would I go there?
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Cause idiot RP'er wants to be smart
<BronyInstrumental> i'm trying to get my livestream procaster working, but i'm crap with techy stuff
<allponiesarebestponi> killerpony7733: i know just kidding around with my name
<TheRandomkid321> Hey mates... Does anyone know ANYTHING about medicine?
<BaconMane> 0,5Ohey guys
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01[11:45:11]	Cuttershy	color text? <- This got my suspicions up.
<Bronysith> hi BaconMane
<BaconMane> 0,5If you type in /part username
<Kammerjunk> B-Y: Well, Pinkie's a baker. It's cake and stuff, but still. Lives on that kind of stuff.
<TheRandomkid321> Or health I mean
<Jim> TheRandomkid321, I know how to eat medicine.
<Michael> hai BaconMane
<BaconMane> 0,5something cool happens
<Wrek> 05inb4 she ban evades and says she'll take her own life... again
<Michael> wat
*Bronysith gives Wrek tea
<Kammerjunk> BaconMane: I don't trust you!
<TheRandomkid321> ANyone know something about health care or something. Probably not but...
<BaconMane> 0,5:(
<Jim> BaconMane, O U
<Jim> :)
<alexxm> heyBaconMane how've you been
<XAX> Bronysith: ...or fix everything and be the bestest publisher evar. But shutting down a multi-million dollar company that you were made head of works too.
<BaconMane> 0,5fine
<killerpony7733> allponiesarebestponi: I actually maintain the belief of equality of ponies etc :)
<allponiesarebestponi> lol
<B-Y> Eat fruits and vegetables
<Bronysith> XAX: i want to shut it down cause it is a cancer to video games everywhere
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: Why would you give him TEA? It's probably also hot as hell in Sweden.
<allponiesarebestponi> i do too
<Wrek> 05Kammerjunk: laughable
<Jim> Sweden? Hot during the summer?
<TheRandomkid321> Buck my ehart is racing... and suddenly pain comes into the problems... BUCK! ANd now I feel weak... WELL AINT THIS BLOODY GREAT!
<Wrek> 05its 7 degrees and rain
<Jim> What have you been smoking?
<Hrafn> yes, Sweden does get hot sometimes :P
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: Wait, really? It's too hot here.
<Wrek> 05aye
<Wrek> 05though in sunshine its probably around 15-20
<Kammerjunk> I'd prefer 7 degrees and rain, really.
<allponiesarebestponi> well brb gonna look at some my little brony memes
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Agreed, Denmark is getting the heat today
<Jim> We have shit weather up where I live
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: you have 2 buttons. one destroys activision. one destroys EA. you can only destroy one. who would you destroy?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA
<TheRandomkid321> Its 2am and everyones asleep... BUCK!
<Kammerjunk> ...is bad.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're doing more damage now.
<Jim> Bronysith, Why can't I bring a friend to press the other button?
<B-Y> Wait... isn't Activision the one that destroyed Crash Bandicoot?
<XAX> ^
*Michael push the 2 buttons
<Kammerjunk> Activision seems to be trying REALLY hard to be worse than EA, but they're still second place.
<killerpony7733> Overall activision can be managed, But EA god no
<Wrek> 05yay rainbow in the dark :D
<Wrek> 05perfect song for a dash PMV
<MASF123> @BaconMane I don't want to risk that what does it do?
<BaconMane> 0,5Something cool
<BaconMane> 0,5Nothing bad
<MASF123> I doubt it.
<BaconMane> 0,5:(
<TheRandomkid321> EA is horrid. If EA owned TF2 this is what it would be like. 30$ a month for premium. 50$ FOr the right to wear hats. 10$ per hat. and 5$ to get more classes.
<B-Y> I don't care: they ruined Crash Bandicoot! He could have the best reputation if wasn't for that pesky Activision!
<Kammerjunk> Nopony trusts you, BaconMane.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA is everything bad about the gaming industry in a nutshell.
<MASF123> ^
<killerpony7733> MASF123: It's a command that does some very stupid if you actually decide to
<allponiesarebestponi> killerpony7733: i think if activison and EA made a game together it would be called dubstep firstperson DLC THE GAME
<TheRandomkid321> Okay my heart feels okay now... SHould I see a doctor if it reoccurs...
<Kammerjunk> OH. THAT'S what /part does.
<MASF123> But what does it do exactly?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: dont they use worse working conditions than a vietnamese sweat shop?
<Bronysith> Wrek: y must this song be so epic?!
<Kammerjunk> BaconMane: So THAT's what you tried. You silly filly.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There's a Jimquisition about why everyone hates EA that pretty much sums up EA.
<Mersander> dat ad
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: not to mention EA in a nutshell gmod video
<MASF123> Kammerjunk, what does it do?
<Jim> Mersander, Get adblock to avoid the adds on the stream
<killerpony7733> MASF123: Make you leave mane chat
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: Oh, I saw that one. It was a neat video.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA just needs to fire Ricotello.
<TheRandomkid321> never use /part..
<allponiesarebestponi> soory about that didnt mean to leave there
<MASF123> Wow. That's messed up. :/
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: Nothing even remotely close to what killerpony7733 said, don't listen to him.
<B-Y> Well, any of you guys, are looking foward Playstation Battle Royale?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: EA just needs to die
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Someone or some group has managed to make the company more hated that Activision.
<Michael> nope
<B-Y> I not... since I don't have a PS
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: You.......:D
<Kammerjunk> D:
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It went from "loved" to "worse than Activision."
<Mersander> :D
<Michael> ^^
<MASF123> I like Activision for releasing Tony Hawk PS HD
<Kammerjunk> I liked EA when they made that murder simulator.
<Kammerjunk> The first one.
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: EA at it's first or so was actually awesome, But it became what it is today due to greedy people
<Jim> Sims?
<XAX> I like EA because first 3 battlefields.
<Kammerjunk> But that's a long while ago now.
<Kammerjunk> Jim: Yeah, that's the one.
<B-Y> I've Fifa '97...
<Spectrum_Rush|droozy> the hostile buyouts and takeovers doesn't help the image
<Jim> damn, I played the shit out of sims
<allponiesarebestponi> if ea made mincraft every block would be DLC
<TheRandomkid321> EA needs to stop being money whores... They are like OH HAI BUY THIS GAME FOR 80$.. Now buy like 10 DLC's for 60$ each which we could have fit into the base game but didnt so we would get more profit :D And while you're at it buy BF3 premium for the same ammount of money you bought the game for.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spectrum_Rush|droozy: And mistreating the consumer and trying to milk them.
<Jim> Loved the wizard expansion to it
<MASF123> Sims was addicting, WAS.
<Bronysith> i want Mass effect 3 so i can support Bioware. but at the same time i will be supporting EA.... FFUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Kammerjunk> Jim: ...I ended up murdering most everyone in my neighbourhood.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bioware is infected by EA.
<Jim> haha :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're not coming back.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: here is how dlc should work. "Would you like some more pie sir?" not "Would you like the rest of your pie sir?"
<killerpony7733> ^This
<Kammerjunk> Nittany_Discord: EA has assumed direct control.
<Jim> Put them in a room, light fireplace, remove door, put sofas everywhere, especially in front of the fireplace
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: That's how expansion packs worked back in the day.
<XAX> 4:04am time not found
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: it was either Bioware is assimilated or destroyed
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: ahh yes. expansion packs
*Bronysith nostalgia booms
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: Yep, It was content made after release and actually having equal content and quality as the main game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01For all I know, expansion packs weren't used to exploit consumers.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But DLC is.
<XAX> Battlefield 1942.
<TheRandomkid321> Yeah I WONT sleep tonight for with my problems I just had I am afraid I shall never awake.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: but the DLC for fallout 3 and new vegas are quite good.
<Kammerjunk> God, I love EA. I can't wait for the next installment of Overhyped Sellout Lens Flare Dubstep War Zombies.
<allponiesarebestponi> what wrong with the chat its not moving or is nopony speaking
<MASF123> ACIII has the dumbest pre-oder bonuses, they are almost as bad as the Epic Mickey The Power of Two pre-order bonus.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: they made it after they made the game
<Jim> Goddamn I loved the Sims Makin' Magic
<herostar_Discorded> if anypony is interested in me doing a stream of slender, click #here. i post it ina seperate room for respect of stream and rules :)
<TheRandomkid321> But I have a phsycaratrist appointment tomorrow at 8:30
<Spectrum_Rush|droozy> ah expansion packs, i remeber my very first was the conquerers expansion for age of empires II
<killerpony7733> allponiesarebestponi: your chat client may have frozen
*Spectrum_Rush|droozy nostalgias
<Michael> i want one new AOE
<Bronysith> BURNING CRUSADE is best expansion pack
<allponiesarebestponi> thanks i fix it
<XAX> Kammerjunk: Warfighter.
<AttacktheAndalite> Dat advertising
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: I liked vanilla.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not a huge fan of DLC pre-order bonuses.
<Jim> true
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I tolerate them.
<alexxm> was that a good one Spectrum_Rush|droozy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Especially if you can buy it later.
<allponiesarebestponi> first day dlc are you kidding me EA
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: what we need is to destroy all the EA with death bombs
<MASF123> If I'm paying full price for a game, I demand a little extra content.
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: It's a bit finicky due to it being ''Well you get stuff few others will get'' when it should be ''Hey everyone can get this but you just get it quicker thats all''
<Spectrum_Rush|droozy> alexxm: I think so, i enjoy it to this day
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: where we insert a piece of marble glass into their parts and smash it with a hammer
<Jim> ouch
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pre-ordering used to mean getting the game on launch guaranteed.
<allponiesarebestponi> PLC= Previously locked content all hail Douglby
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: and they bleed out over 5 days
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not "Buy this early and get free stuff."
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: Eeyup
<TheRandomkid321> Fucking BF3 primium. I mean TF2 premium I can understand. I mena you are playing a game for free that once would have costed you. But paying money for a game you bought is moderatly acceptable... UNLESS IT MAKE YOU A MOTHER BUCKING VIP!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Only super-hyped games got pre-orders.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now everything does.
<allponiesarebestponi> get a 30$ season pass for the low price of 50$ EA!!!!! and Dinkleburg
<MASF123> Haha anything gets a pre-order now. :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I don't mind pre-ordering as a way to generate sales.
<TheRandomkid321> I see game with preorder bonuses and I dont even know anything about them...
<Jim> This is what is wrong with gaming today http://static.bestbuy.com/myrz/web/Content/Offers/Images/120603_Project20_Tile.jpg
<Michael> damn, i remember when i buyed my TF2, now is free
<Kammerjunk> It'll be fun playing Call of Dubstep: Black Wubs 2 when it comes out.
<Bronysith> Jim: gaming has just gone down hill for a while
<Kammerjunk> (No, it won't)
<Everlasting_Joy> Nittany_Discord: Not only that, it's nice to have your order garunteed.
<Michael> dat solo
<Bronysith> i think my first pre order was.... SSBB
<allponiesarebestponi> Bronysith: its all shooting and blowing up stuff
<Kammerjunk> Jim: I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
<killerpony7733> Pre-order is still a way to get a copy for sure, But yeah the free stuff idea, No
<Michael> SSBB is a great game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My first pre-order may have been Halo 2.
<TheRandomkid321> I noticed that nowadays for a game to be popular it needs to be in a popular series, really bucking violent, unique gameplay, or have hot cheerleaders who fight zombies with giant chainsaws while wearing a rather revealing outfit.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I miss them doing physical content packs.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: my brother was so gay for that game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now the special editions hve DLC.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*have
<killerpony7733> TheRandomkid321: Dat reference
<Jim> Only things I've ever preordered is Torchlight 2 and Guild wars 2
<alexxm> yeah just wait for the special edtion and get the DLC with the game
<TrixieMuffins> TheRandomkid321: and be voiced by Twilight Sparkle ^^
<TheRandomkid321> I only preordered LOZ OoT 3d and SKYRIIIM!
<Jim> TheRandomkid321, Also that hot cheerleader is voiced by Tara Strong
<Wrek> 05daaaaat guitar
<allponiesarebestponi> TheRandomkid321: nowadays if it doesnt have the words Call Of Duty Activion or Infinityward its not a good game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The main 3 things in gaming today that I can't stand are DLC that's on-disc, always-on DRM, and online passes.
<TheRandomkid321> This guy got NOTHING on Angus Young.
<Jim> Always online sucks arse
<Wrek> 05also when i pre ordered the special edition of deus ex HR ig ot the making of DVD and the art book. asewll as a figurine. more than that is asking for too much
<TheRandomkid321> Jim ONLY on PS3
<MASF123> Lol. I pre-order LoZ: OoT 3D and got nothing. :D
<alexxm> why is always online even a thing
<allponiesarebestponi> @Nittany_Discord: and you cant forget everything is basically an FPS
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Yep i pre-ordered myself the augmented edition, :)
*XAX doesent have any problems with current games because he hasn't purchased a game himself since christmas '10
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I haven't purchased a major title in a long time.
<Jim> man, I bought too many steam games
<TheRandomkid321> MASF123 HOW ABOUT A REPLICA OF THE OCARINE OF TIME! THAT I LOST!
<Jim> ended up with spending 131 Euro
*Michael never have any problems with games
<Kammerjunk> >Buying games
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't count Arma 2 at major.
<allponiesarebestponi> i think halo 4 looks like Call of duty so im not getting it
<Kammerjunk> Although if you pirate an indie game, you're a dick.
<Wrek> 05alexxm: casue always online means that it will be harder to fool the game that you bought it
<Michael> anypony has never played bayonetta?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think indie is where it's at.
<herostar_Discorded> i like half life 2.
<TheRandomkid321> Arma II Is only popular because of Day Zed
<Wrek> 05note that i said harder, not impossible
<allponiesarebestponi> I CANT WAIT FOR BORDERLANDS 2
<Jim> I like supporting indie developers
<Jim> ^
<allponiesarebestponi> oh soory capps lock was on
<Kammerjunk> I didn't even get the first Borderland.
<Jim> allponiesarebestponi, Justified
<XAX> TheRandomkid321: Daisy
<Kammerjunk> Borderlands*
<Kammerjunk> But that's because I don't have a console.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01As long as those devs don't pull the same BS AAA publishers do, I'm happy.
<Chrysalis> hai guys
<MASF123> I would want Fighting is Magic to go Indie on Xbox, it would be so sweet.
<Jim> Kammerjunk, it's on PC too
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: And indeed there is
<Kammerjunk> Oh.

<Jim> Kammerjunk, It was on sale on steam last week for like 5$ for the complete pack
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They can't afford to pull BS like AAA publishers.
<Kammerjunk> allponiesarebestponi: I tried playing it with a friend. Wasn't my type of game.
<Michael> TheRandomkid321: damn, that game looks so damn good
<Chrysalis> im pretty good, just got back from interview
<Chrysalis> which went well
<Jim> Chrysalis, Awesome :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Good Chrysalis
<BronyInstrumental> haia Chrysalis
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hope you get the job.
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: Oh and one thing i want to note i hate is, PUBLISHER POWER OVER DEVS
<Chrysalis> me too, not only is it an awesome job
<Chrysalis> its in manchester
<Michael> Chrysalis: GL
*MASF123 regrets starting a topic about pre-order bonuses
<BronyInstrumental> dat les paul whammy bar
<Chrysalis> which means BUCK will be easy to get to
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01killerpony7733: Yeah, me too.
<allponiesarebestponi> oh ok Kammerjunk it s not a favorted game of te community i think
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs MASF123
<Kammerjunk> TheRandomkid321: Seriously? You can make it excluding the blade yourself for under 20 bucks.
<Chrysalis> speaking of BUCK, anyone here going PM me ASAP pleaesr
<MASF123> Awww. :) Shucks, Nittany_Discord.
<Chrysalis> please*
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: It's exactly what EA is in the end a publisher that pushes it devs to make games for them not the devs making games they want, Ugh
<Chrysalis> mfw icechat made MASF123's comment a link
<TrixieMuffins> the New Robot revolution dlc for Borderlands was so funny , everything was robotified ^^ and near the end the Destroyer was just a cardbord cutout ^^
<Saturn> 08,01dat feeling when you're deleting an ubuntu repo mirror
<herostar_Discorded> i say something like my interests, but it doesnt really matter too much..
<Saturn> 08,0188GB...
<Jim> I don't know dat feel
<XAX> Saturn: ._.
<Kammerjunk> 88 GB? That's almost 4 games!
<Michael> lol
<Saturn> 08,01only took about 30 minutes to download, though
<MASF123> Chrysalis, what?
<XAX> Kammerjunk: Lol'd
<Saturn> 08,01huzzah for university networks \o/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Signing up for EA and Activision is a death sentence. With EA, you get whored to a husk. With Activision, you get the same, and then you're put on a CoD-related project or shut down.
<AttacktheAndalite> Ohay Saturn
<herostar_Discorded> 88 gb is almost my whold pc memory :(
<Kammerjunk> I have 3 TB, I think.
<Kammerjunk> I need more soon, though.
<Michael> hai Saturn
<herostar_Discorded> you can get more O_O
<BronyInstrumental> hi Saturn :(
<BronyInstrumental> :)*
<MASF123> 3 Terrabytes? :O
<Kammerjunk> Well, 3 TB is only on this desktop computer. I have more on a fileserver.
<herostar_Discorded> i have a laptop.
<XAX> Hmm. Now that I think about it, Battlefield 3 is sitting on my computer being useless because it crashes my video drivers for some reason.
<B-Y> I'll post a Pony comic soon
<herostar_Discorded> :"(
<Kammerjunk> But the fileserver is just for stuff like music, video, game images, et cetera.
<XAX> I may delete it.
<allponiesarebestponi> @Nittany_Discord: i do agree with you but if you dont apreently get signed up with them you dont get seen really and if you do you get lots of money if you want to say that but other than that i agree
<allponiesarebestponi> wow the song got loud
<alexxm> oh yes this song is awesome
<herostar_Discorded> audio improvement :)
<XAX> Nittany_Discord: I got MW3 and BO recently. I haven't been roped into no project. I've just been playing them like a thankful person for not having to pay for either game myself.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't hate CoD.
<XAX> Nittany_Discord: Never said that :)
<herostar_Discorded> am i the only pony who likes Half Life 2?
<allponiesarebestponi> i would rath play BO than MW# or any COD for that matter its just more realistic than a fish (COD)
<XAX> herostar_Discorded: He'll no
<Michael> herostar_Discorded: nope
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01herostar_Discorded: That was an awesome game.
<XAX> hell*
<herostar_Discorded> you know you can get synergy for it and do multiplayer?
<XAX> I have CoD1 on my external somewhere.:.
<Kammerjunk> So I just checked out how EA's shares are doing.
<XAX> Kammerjunk: Enlighten us.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01herostar_Discorded: Yep.
<Kammerjunk> "Down," I believe the word is.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have that mod.
<XAX> Kammerjunk: lol.
<String_Shredder> I was in an xbox live party once and my friend's friend said he couldn't wait for half life 3. I just laughed.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA is dying. Dropping shares and posting losses.
<allponiesarebestponi> herostar_Discorded: dont talk to me about valve the god of devolping to me cuz i will never stop with valve and how better they are with devoloping even if they cant cout to 3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's why they need to fire their CEO and whoever else is ruining the company.
<B-Y> Which of you, can understand Economy?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01All of their BS is benefiting no-one.
<Jim> http://images.nonexiste.net/popular/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Just-a-reminder-of-where-you-are-EA.jpeg
<herostar_Discorded> allponiesarebestponies portal three. this summer. it's an official release too.
<herostar_Discorded> err, next summer*
<allponiesarebestponi> ^ no it ended it cant be
<Michael> EA will be like a phoenix i think
<Jim> hopefully not
<XAX> Michael: lol
<Kammerjunk> It's really laughable seeing how their shares are for the entirety of 2012.
<Jim> let it burn and stay ashes
<herostar_Discorded> allponiesarebestponies E3 dissagreed
<Michael> burning in fire but reviving from his flames
<Michael> with good games, i hope
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not just good game. No bullshit.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Taking more cues from Valve than Activision.
<Michael> ^
<allponiesarebestponi> Valve puts a lot of effort and even color int to games and you dont see colors other than greay red and brown nowadays
<herostar_Discorded> that pony just had a cigarette...
<herostar_Discorded> <_<...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Valuing the consumer and giving them what they want instead of punishing them and trying to milk them.
<XAX> Valve is awesome in too many ways. Their new employee handbook is s hilarious and great read, for god sake.
<Kammerjunk> allponiesarebestponi: No kidding. I don't usually get emotionally invested in games. End of Portal 2? Good Lord, I cried.
<Kammerjunk> I laughed, I cried.
<herostar_Discorded> i have both portals :3
<Jim> Kammerjunk, Portal 2 is best game
<Kammerjunk> ...I hope I'm not the only one who cried at the end of Portal 2.
<XAX> The glossary of Valves new employee handbook gives a definition of Ponies
<allponiesarebestponi> Kammerjunk: cryed i balled manly tears of joy at the end and kept singing want you gone and cara mia
<Kammerjunk> Oh, good.
<BronyInstrumental> i haven't completed portal 2.
<herostar_Discorded> and if they didn't lie about portal 3 then i'll get that too
<Kammerjunk> XAX: I bought The Final Hours of Portal 2, and got a sight into the life of a VALVe employee.
<B-Y> That message was a lie
<Jim> Valve don't know the number 3, herostar_Discorded
<Kammerjunk> It is awesome.
<allponiesarebestponi> BronyInstrumental: whera are you
<herostar_Discorded> ik they do. you'll see :3
<Michael> like HL3
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, VALVe treats their employees like an employer should.
<BronyInstrumental> allponiesarebestponi: when wheatley uses GLaDOS' test chambers on you
<Michael> never pass number 3
<Kammerjunk> INB4 Portal 2: Episode 1 and 2.
<XAX> Kammerjunk: Reading the handbook gave me a pretty good idea as well. It would be a fucking amazing life to work there.
<allponiesarebestponi> BronyInstrumental: oh god the last test is hard
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk valve dont do anything to there employees
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Valve counts like King Authur from Monty Python. Expect Half Life 5 soon.
<Kammerjunk> I would laugh if the next Half-Life game would be called "Half Life: Episode 2 Part 1".
<Chrysalis> most devs are terrified of working for valve
<Kammerjunk> They have. A headcrab. In the lobby.
<Michael> lol
<Kammerjunk> What more could you want?!
<Chrysalis> desks which stay still
<herostar_Discorded> ik what they really ARE working on right now. the third installation to the L4D series
<B-Y> Half Life: Episode 2, Part 1, 1° Chapter
<Kammerjunk> No wait. They have a -barnacle- in the lobby.
<Jim> Kammerjunk, They also have a TF2 Turret in the lobby
<XAX> They could always go 'Half life 2: the conclusion'.
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, the turret, too.
<Jim> that actually works
<herostar_Discorded> http://www.leftfordead3.com/
<Jim> it doesn't shoot bullets though
<Jim> only makes the sound effects and flashes
<Jim> motion detected
<Michael> damn another L4D?
<Kammerjunk> No.
<Michael> oh ok
<Michael> i just bought L4D2
<Alchemist> No. Valve cant count to three.
<Jim> there's a recent update to L4D2, a new map, also a community map where everything is minecraft
<Michael> :D
<XAX> Jim: That was made by Weta Workshop here in NZ :D
<Kammerjunk> Oh, don't they have that golden crowbar in the lobby too?
<allponiesarebestponi> VALVE please we need HL3 soon or you will be forgotten (i will still play you games)
<Kammerjunk> I would pay them my soul for any of the things they have in the lobby.
<Jim> Bronysith, We must get that Minecraft mod for L4D2 soon
<MASF123> My favorite fanmade picture yet. ^_^ http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d57h12o
<Kammerjunk> allponiesarebestponi: I doubt it. They're still making that new CS game, you know.
<allponiesarebestponi> i want the crowbar and the HEV suit
<Chrysalis> they work on whatever they want
<Chrysalis> as long as there is no number 3
<Kammerjunk> I really want Half Life 2: Episode 2 Part 1 and 2, though.
<Jim> They'll make HL4 next, just to mess with us
<XAX> Kammerjunk: Not sure if want that game.
<Jim> MASF123, Adorable! :)
<Kammerjunk> XAX: You want that game.
<MASF123> Thanks Jim
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: I say, that is a d'awwful picture.
<Chrysalis|Dinner> time to eat some love
<Kammerjunk> o u
<Chrysalis|Dinner> ...
<Chrysalis|Dinner> that sounds really dirty
<MASF123> DeathPwny is one of my favorite MLP artists.
<Alchemist> MASF123: how about this http://derpy.me/a-Vba
<alexxm> have fun Chrysalis|Dinner
<Michael> wat
<Jim> Chrysalis|Dinner, Have fun devouring the love of the innocent
<Kammerjunk> Oh, that reminds me of the Changeling fic I'm reading. It's great. So much theoretical lore about Changelings.
<XAX> Kammerjunk: I have the beta. No one plays on the Aus/NZ servers very often though, so I've barely been able to try it.
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Ah? explain good sir
<TrixieMuffins> It'd be cool if someone made a timetravel game and start with the sequel ^^
<XAX> Pony brigade has a CS:GO beta server...
<MASF123> Oh damn, that's great! Alchemist
<Michael> dat pic
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: Well, it's actually Human in Equestria, but with a TWEEST. It's really good. Hasn't updated in a while, but I think the guy is on vacation or something.
<Michael> just adorable
<Alchemist> MASF123: I can look up the artist if you want to.
<MASF123> uh ok
<allponiesarebestponi> i know what Valve is doing theyre gonna make HL3 when season comes out
<XAX> Kammerjunk: Visionary?
<allponiesarebestponi> season 3
<Kammerjunk> XAX: No, it's titled "Love Mine".
<Alchemist> MASF123: http://rom-art.deviantart.com/
<B-Y> Speaking of Ponies, who has the fear for an upcoming MLP Live Show...?
<XAX> Kammerjunk: Ah.
<alexxm> B-Y its already happened
<herostar_Discorded> i thought gmod was also great...
<Everlasting_Joy> allponiesarebestponi: No, they'll release HL3 when no one remembers HL2.
<XAX> alexxm: Another one.
<Kammerjunk> Oh, and I'm still looking at this picture - http://derpy.me/2UvXV
<alexxm> oh ok XAX
<B-Y> well... and for its sequel?
<Michael> how about this: http://derpy.me/9mZ0R
<Alchemist> Kammerjunk: :D
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Dat high quality GIF
<allponiesarebestponi> Everlasting_Joy: no they will never make it then i will always remember them
<XAX> Kammerjunk: Seen it. Love it. SO MUCH.
<Kammerjunk> Alchemist: I never stopped looking at it. Well, I slept and stuff, but besides that.
<Everlasting_Joy> allponiesarebestponi: But you won't live forever.
<allponiesarebestponi> i will ask promision from celestia
<Alchemist> Kammerjunk: Im happy it makes you happy ;)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Who wants to live forever anyway~
<allponiesarebestponi> ^ me
<Kammerjunk> I can think of a few people.
<herostar_Discorded> Scoot-Scootaloo me
<killerpony7733> Scoot-Scootaloo: Depending on trade offs and plus sides i may want to
<Michael> me
<alexxm> could be intreasting
<herostar_Discorded> If i could live forever, i'd start helping every person on the planet AND make a portal to equestria
<Alchemist> Forever? No. Would be bored out of my mind after a couple hundred years :D
<allponiesarebestponi> i want to go to Las Pegasis right now
<Michael> ^ i'll help :D
<Kammerjunk> If living forever means eternal youth and means immortality without invincibility, I'd like to live forever.
<Kammerjunk> If nothing else, then because of the technology.
<Jim_> Yeah, immortality with invincibility would suck
<Kammerjunk> Because of supernovas and stuff.
<alexxm> yeah that would suck
<Jim_> It'd mean you'll at one point will end up inside a black hole or somestuff
<Jim_> FOREVER
<allponiesarebestponi> scientist have found a gene in flies that makes them live for 20% long and 20% stronger and found the same gene in humans but are afriad of trying it out on us
<Michael> lol
<herostar_Discorded> i'd sign up for that allponiesarebestponies
<MASF123> Get ready for the future bronies! http://kp-shadowsquirrel.deviantart.com/art/Pinkie-Pie-Pose-0-212151789 Simply amazing!
<Alchemist> the only reason Id want to hang on for couple billion(?) years longer is to witness the sun blow up.
<Kammerjunk> allponiesarebestponi: The enzyme called telomerase?
<Jim> would those genes make you 20% cooler too?
<allponiesarebestponi> Kammerjunk: yes
<Alchemist> telomerase is an enzyme, not a gene
<Lil_B> I'm sweating so much -.- I don't know if its because of excitement or the heat
<Michael> |m|
<Kammerjunk> God, I love the idea of gene manipulation.
<XAX> Smashing.
<MASF123> anypony see that link?
<Everlasting_Joy> Lil_B: Does it matter ;)?
<allponiesarebestponi> soory i get them mixed up all the time im only 13
<Jim> Playing god sounds smashing
<BronyInstrumental> i think he thinks we rock
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: It's just as scary as it could do good
<Kammerjunk> Mostly because I'm a jerk. I just want to change the curliness of my hair and I hate my eye colour.
<killerpony7733> MASF123: Yes?
<herostar_Discorded> MASF123 sorry to say, but a 3D model of a pony is although neat, possible in our time, this flash being an example
<allponiesarebestponi> so i forget things
<Lil_B> Everlasting_Joy YEs... kinda... no...
<Alchemist> Kammerjunk: yeah, but many misinterpret it. You cant have superhuman abilities throiugh gene manipulation.
<Kammerjunk> Alchemist: God, no.
<Kammerjunk> That'd be silly.
<killerpony7733> ^That
<Everlasting_Joy> Lil_B: I suppose the heat would be bad, but if it's excitement, well, that's a good thing.
<Kammerjunk> What do you take me for, an X-Man?
<Alchemist> Kammerjunk: would be awesome though :D
<Wrek> 05again
<Wrek> 05hope you enjoyed some more concerts
<Wrek> 05^_^
<allponiesarebestponi> the video is loading
<Wrek> 05scoot-scootaloo is up next if he havent ninja'd already
<Michael> moar rock :D
<alexxm> awesome music Wrek
<Kammerjunk> But yeah, people are trying to find more and more ways of either rejuvenating telomerase or even preventing loss of it in the first place.
<Jim> pff, everyone knows you don't get superpowers from gene manipulation. Radioactive waste is where it's at.
<allponiesarebestponi> why is it buffering
<Chrysalis|Dinner> i be back
<Jim> allponiesarebestponi, Probably because he stopped streaming
<Lil_B> Everlasting_Jo well the bad kidnt, I'm waiting for an answer from a person who and it decides if I'll be at GalaCon or not >.< I the didn't answer even though he was already on
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: If i remember biology the reason we age is a safety feature,
<Dovah> Morning everypony.
<Michael> hai Dovah
<alexxm> hey Dovah how've you been
<XAX> allponiesarebestponi: Wrek just hopped off. Scoot-Scootaloo might be getting on soon.
<valoreins> hey guys today is Lauren Faust's b-day didn't realize that till now
<Jim> killerpony7733, The reason we age is because our cells oxidizes and repair themselves faulty
<Everlasting_Joy> Lil_B: Fair enough, but who is this Jo person ;)?
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: It probably is, but science isn't about 'why', it's about 'why not'. Why is so much of our science dangerous? Why not MARRY safe science if you love it so much?!
<alexxm> valoreins i didn't even know that
<MASF123> what is ninja'd exactly? Like left?
<Jim> dat portal quote
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: In fact, why not invent a special safety door that won't hit you on the BUTT on the way out, BECAUSE YOU ARE FIRED.
<herostar_Discorded> ^this
<Jim> dat second portal quote
<XAX> Kammerjunk: That's sounds like it's straight our of portal 2.
<allponiesarebestponi> Jim: radioavtive waste would destroy every cell in your body possibly causeing cancer and if not a small mutation poibbly and extra to or something
<Kammerjunk> It is.
<Alchemist> Kammerjunk: Im wasnt that good in biology, is this telomerase business about the chromosomes getting shorter over time, leading to a point where they can no longer participate in mytosis --> death?
<XAX> and then my grammar crashed.
<Michael> so much science
<Kammerjunk> Alchemist: Neither was I, but that sounds about right.
<alexxm> all the science
<herostar_Discorded> Alchemist i'm better with chronological matters.
<MASF123> What does ninja'd mean? Vanished in smoke?
<Jim> allponiesarebestponi, I know, just pointing a finger on how ridiculous comic book heroes can be
<Lil_B> Everlasting_Joy the Person who drives me there XD, just someone from the german bronys Forum who drives there and who offered to carry people from my region,
<Jim> even thought they ARE awesome
<allponiesarebestponi> for a 13 year old im pretty smart sorry every pony
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: It means someone said something RIGHT before someone else.
<Kammerjunk> They ninja'd that person.
<herostar_Discorded> MASF123 to do something like a ninja. like say i ninja'd your waffles. that means i took them and you never noticed.
<allponiesarebestponi> well for 13 year olds nowadays
<Kammerjunk> Like if two people want to say "FIRST", the guy who did it first is the ninja.
<herostar_Discorded> maah waffles
<Alchemist> and the telomerase enzyme is preventing that damage? (being the telomer part of the chromosome getting shorter)
<allponiesarebestponi> what about PIRATE
<MASF123> I will go with Kammerjunk's definition, if that's fine with you.
<herostar_Discorded> ima play portal :P
<allponiesarebestponi> Pirates are awesome
<killerpony7733> allponiesarebestponi: You can be relatively smart within certain standards, but otherwise there most likely people that has the same level of intellect as you
<Jim> Yarr harr fidle dee dee.
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: I think both are correct, though.
<Kammerjunk> They just apply to different situations.
<MASF123> For real?
<Kammerjunk> Oh, and guys, you know what's a cool thing? Nanotechnology.
<Michael> ^
<killerpony7733> ^^
<XAX> ^^^
<Alchemist> Kammerjunk: which part of it?
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: We need it to happen cause, Deus ex is the future!!!
<Kammerjunk> Alchemist: The part that doesn't create monsters, because this isn't a sci-fi horror film.
<MASF123> Something to do with microscopic robots living in your blood stream?
<XAX> The only place I know nanotech from is ratchet and clank.
<Alchemist> Kammerjunk: I though more like the nanocarrier, the surface chemistry, the physical properties (like quantum dots)
<MASF123> nantech re-fuels your health in Ratchet and Clank
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: Well, that's more likely than you think. Apparently, a bunch of eggheads have managed to make a bionic cell which can do basic arithmetic.
<allponiesarebestponi> killerpony7733: i said after words smart for 13 yr old nowadays and i should have said around here in my town alot of 13 yr olds are really dumb sorry for not saying that earlyer token of sorrow :(
<Michael> nanorobots that could repair something u can :D
<Kammerjunk> Alchemist: Oh, good. Well, I don't know about quantum stuff, but yeah.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Science!
<allponiesarebestponi> MATH Mental Atacks Towards Humans
<MASF123> Kammerjunk, now that's just crazy talk.
<Hrafn> it's not real science if it doesn't involve glowy stuff in test tubes
<Alchemist> Kammerjunk: if all goes well I'll be an assistant on a nanochemical research from september
<Michael> scootaloo
<AttacktheAndalite> Suddenly Scootaloo
<Jim_> dammit internet
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Rina-chan!
<Liokin> Scoots! =D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I call it "Random Rina Rants"
<killerpony7733> allponiesarebestponi: You can feel like you are smarter then your peers due it being quite correct, But in the whole world itself people most likely share the same level of intellect like you. Just never let it go to your head, You are always smart by somekind of standard in the end
<allponiesarebestponi> :D
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: And with that, I mean that the goal they have is to make it able to respond differently to different stuff. Like it could be designed to take a signal from an infection as input, and the output would be to deliver the proper treatment.
<MASF123> Or RRR for short.
<Kammerjunk> Alchemist: Oh? That's pretty awesome.
<Michael> lol
<Michael> awesome
<alexxm> damn rinas talented
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Expect more... whenever I feel like it :S

<Liokin> XAX: Later bro /)
<B-Y> There are only discounts
<Kandarihu> I used to love the Italian opening until I recently read that it only exists because it's being dubbed by a company that has a monoponily on all the anime licenses and does a bad thing with everything.
<MASF123> See you XAX
<MaxTheBrony> Bye XAX
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<twilight_sprinkle> XAX: bye

<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: No we're not
<Very_Silly_Filly> I dodn't need money
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sad how BET is so stereotypical like that.
<B-Y> It was so weird that I wonder if it's true that this coupon business strategy is used for real...

<allponiesarebestponi> he is kinda right but its still illegal

<Liokin_Maid> Blindness isnt an excuse??
<twilight_sprinkle> dat piano~
<MaxTheBrony> Is the Lawyer black? or is he white?

<Liokin_Maid> Yes. Very much so YES
<Very_Silly_Filly> Batman is now a defence attourney
<MASF123> Max the Brony, you mean Tom DeVoir? Oh, he's white. -_-
<pony_3423> f
<sagas> yep, still psychos
<String_Shredder> nanananananana BAT LAYWER!
<Ilchymis> Yeah, child sex is pretty sick.
<allponiesarebestponi> yes
<sagas> yep, still disgusting
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<Lil_B> yes, we do actually
<Liokin_Maid> Yes we do! >:3
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Child sex is sick and traumatic.
<Kandarihu> I'd call the Japanese example disgusting. And there are a lot of Japanese who would also call that disgusting.
<sagas> yeah, all vlid evidence
<sagas> valid
<Maid_Discord> 11,01It's illegal for a reason.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Child sex is sadistic and fucktarded.
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah
<MaidSurge> ^
<sagas> throw the racism card :O
<twilight_sprinkle> interestingly, the rape statistics are extremely low in Japan afaik
<Lil_B> the examples are all irrelevant, the law says that it is illegal, thatds final until it gets chainged
<allponiesarebestponi> @Maid_Discord: Agreed it is sick
<MaxTheBrony> In Japan they Got more honor ^^
<MaxTheBrony> Atleast they had
<Liokin_Maid> Omg....are you serious....Someone ask him to define racism!
<MASF123> @Maid_Discord, it's illegal because it's wrong, not because it is discusting.
<Ilchymis> Oh, times like these, I'm glad I'm in this part of the internet. Many people elsewhere on the interwebs would be all for child sex. I'm proud of you guys.
<MaidSurge> Let's hope it's never changed, Lil_B
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<allponiesarebestponi> EWWWW
<MaxTheBrony> Btw we maybe shouldnt talk about this
<Liokin_Maid> MASF123: Its wrong and disgusting! >:3
<MaxTheBrony> lets end the conversation here ^^
<sagas> :D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Umm...

<MaxTheBrony> ass*
<Wrek> 05under 15 is off limits. period.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Ewwwwwwwwwww.
<MaidSurge> EWWWWWWWWW
<Liokin_Maid> Ah cmon!! XD
<Kandarihu> Liokin_Maid, the race card is disturbingly common to play. I forgot what year this episode was made, but over half of Obama's adminsitration, that's basically the entire defense for all of his policies.
<allponiesarebestponi> ewwwwwwww
<Liokin_Maid> Guilty!!
<Dark92Enigma> btw My next test is at 6pm.....chances are, i'll get here by the end of the trilogy by 9pm-ish.............so this means I WILL SEE ''It's A Trap''!
<twilight_sprinkle> iz cool
<sagas> Wrek: thats a low limit....
<Very_Silly_Filly> Wrek: Since when was Boondocks under 15?
<MASF123> You wassup! Riley! \O/ :D
<Liokin_Maid> Kandarihu: But look at this evidence!!
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Liokin_Maid> Kandarihu: Theres nothing racial about it!
<MaxTheBrony> that girl O.o
<sagas> fo show
<MaxTheBrony> Ew
<Dark92Enigma> btw, did the stream explode when Darth Vader said : I AM YOUR FATHER?
<Wrek> 05sagas: depends on waht country you're from
<Maid_Discord> 11,01She wears censor glases.
<RainBowJack> lol
<Wrek> 05seeing the us has what. 21 on everythign or something
<MASF123> :D
<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma, yes. It exploded early
<RainBowJack> she is sencored
<allponiesarebestponi> i wonder why
<sagas> Wrek: 15 is rather low for golden shower fetish porn
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Liokin_Maid> omg...*face hoof*
<sagas> did he let his daughter watch that video :D
<Lil_B> this court need more OBJECTION
<Liokin_Maid> This trial is so BS
<MaxTheBrony> haha
*Dark92Enigma NINTENDO: NOW YOU'RE PLAYING WITH PEDOPHILIA........AND THAT'S JUST WRONG
<Underpony_> R Kelly is a strong independant black woman who don't need no man
<Liokin_Maid> XD
<allponiesarebestponi> sadly so accurate
<String_Shredder> oh no, a white person!
<Ponies47> HEY EVERYPONY! :p
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma the reference! I got it!
<Kandarihu> This show is Japanese animated (although produced for American audiences, so it still doesn't count as anime to me). That's why the underage victim of sexual crime has to have her eyes censored out.
<sagas> :D
<MASF123> String_Shredder, where?!?!?! :O
*Lil_B waves at Ponies47
<sagas> smell like pledge
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu *sighs* i had to study for two tests, so i missed it..........we can still see it at friday movie nights?
<Dark92Enigma> right?
<Lil_B> oh no... we vote
<String_Shredder> 0asf123: over there!
<Kandarihu> It would be funny if that girl were to appear in a later episode, and her eyes are still censored because of what happened to her in a totally different episode.
<MaxTheBrony> I prefer Anime animated shows before the Shows like bewvis and butthead animated .
<allponiesarebestponi> how awful :|
<MASF123> Hang that n*gga I gotz the rope right here!
<Michael> i'm back
<sagas> that makes everything alright
<pony_6861> xD
<sagas> i got one :D
<Michael> objection!
<Liokin_Maid> sigh.....-lol
<Lil_B> Objection overruled
<sagas> this is retarded :D
<MaxTheBrony> im thinking of Phoenix wright :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Dr Brown is good
<MaxTheBrony> I dunno why
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03You tell 'em, Batman!
<Eli> What is this show? this is totally crazy!
<Michael> amurica
<sagas> very very retarded :D
<Underpony_> XD
<allponiesarebestponi> this is worse than the Casey anthony trial
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B btw is the ''California'' kid in this one?
<MASF123> Eli, it's The Boondocks
<Underpony_> Eli: Boondocks
<Kandarihu> Um, this is what sophistry is, right?
<Alister> Patriotism is a dangerous weapon
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<sagas> america urinated on R Kelly
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma yes, that was in the Wizard :)
<Dark92Enigma> After all, he's Batman
<MASF123> Adam West!
<Eli> this is just crazy...
<Kandarihu> An appeal to passion.
<MaxTheBrony> Mmm hmm
<String_Shredder> To dumb it down: the us pissed on R. Kelly
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B IKR? But is he in this Boondocks episode <------
<Dark92Enigma> ?
<sagas> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Alister> this what happens when people think with emotions rather than logic
<sagas> wat....
<pony_6345> wtf
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Now piss on the jury.
<MaxTheBrony> That dance xD
<Michael> lol
<Very_Silly_Filly> 'dat judge
<Ilchymis> Racism is shameful.
<Kandarihu> String_Shredder, that's not dumbing it down further. It's very hard to dumb it down further than it already has.
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma Oh... I don't know, I didn't paid that much attention to something like that Oo
<sagas> I guess R Kelly can get away with urinating on a 14 year old
<RainBowJack> he said it he said the N word
<Dark92Enigma> Oh ok Lil_B
<sagas> on video
<CrimsonPhoenix> Huey being bad-ass
<String_Shredder> oh, shit
<Eli> show them kid!
<Kandarihu> Huey being awesome.
<Michael> the kid is boss
<sagas> some goddamn sense!
<allponiesarebestponi> THANK YOU
<Dark92Enigma> a 5th grader.................smarter?????
<Ilchymis> Huey turning out to be the voice of reason.
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<MASF123> RainBowJack, that's not right that's not HIS word.
<MASF123> :O
<Kandarihu> The judge was dancing too. He's partial to R. Kelly
<sagas> Ilchymis: as always
<Zanon> yep pinkiepie is best ponyhttp://i128.photobucket.com/albums/p197/lzanon/MLP%20pics/00pinkiepuenzanon.png
<CrimsonPhoenix> Huey's always the voice of reason
<RainBowJack> MASF123 but he said it
<MASF123> Oh no!
<MASF123> :O
<allponiesarebestponi> not as worse as the Casey Anthony trial
<sagas> Zanon: thats not how you spell rainbow dash
<Dark92Enigma> Not as worse as the O.J. trial
<twilight_sprinkle> meh, patriotism
<Zanon> this is dashie http://i128.photobucket.com/albums/p197/lzanon/MLP%20pics/0zanonnrainbowdash.png
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Eli> Just asking: Do they really pull of shit like that in the US?
<sagas> of coarse I can!
<Kandarihu> The problem here is racial solidarity. And the solution is simple, but it's not easy. We need to start looking at each other simply as human beings, not as white people or black people.
<pony_6345> im so confused
<CrimsonPhoenix> what's that OC?
<twilight_sprinkle> Zanon: youre flarechaser?
<sagas> Eli: exageratef

<MaxTheBrony> Is this game scary?
*MegaMoonShine hugs Michael and MaxTheBrony
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<Kandarihu> If I'm aware that I'm facing an attempt to scare me that doesn't pose any threat (such as a thrill ride, or a haunted house), it's a lot harder to me to get scared.
<sagas> MaxTheBrony: nope, not at all
*Michael hugs MegaMoonShine
<sagas> not a good choice of song
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03lag spike coming >_<

<Alister> sagas: Isn't it obvous ? the main character is Twilight Sparkle trying to retrieve her friend ship report
<somepony_else> who's playing?
<String_Shredder> sagas: boy scouts
<Ilchymis> He's going to pop up... lol

<Eli> that's what you get for breaking rule number 3^^
<Lil_B> somepony_else *
<MaxTheBrony> Heya somepony_else ^^
<MegaMoonShine> Wow, he lived
<sagas> shitballs
<somepony_else> hey Liokin_Maid /)

<Very_Silly_Filly> DED
<Kandarihu> Drinking my lemonade. It's alright lemonade.

<pony_7007> Just scared the crap out of my cat
<somepony_else> hallo Lil_B and MaxTheBrony
<Michael> dis is now good
<sagas> :D
<MaxTheBrony> yeah
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Wrek> 05i find the mechanics funny
<twilight_sprinkle> slenderman is surrounded by electro-magnetic fields it would seem
<MaidSurge> .__. he lived!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Wrek: Ikr
<RainBowJack> what is the game called?
<sagas> He has the effect of fucking with electronics
<Cuttershy> I read the rules :D
<MegaMoonShine> RainBowJack: Slender
<Very_Silly_Filly> Slenderman has got EMP powers
<Kandarihu> To be honest, I haven't played a lot of survival horror. So I can't guarantee that I can laugh off those like I laugh off the other pranks.
<Alchemist> twilight_sprinkle: put him in a faraday cage. problem solved
<sagas> Know your Slenderman cannon, people. It could save your life
*Maid_Discord 11,01dusts Cuttershy with his feather duster
<Eli> rule number 3, dude!
<Kandarihu> Very_Silly_Filly, that's no EMP.
<MaidSurge> What happens when you get all paper? Game over?
<sagas> You dont fuck with slenderman
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hmmm. Okay
<Liokin_Maid> Cuttershy: You could have just invited a few ponys to your channel you know -lol
<sagas> MaidSurge: I net he kills you
*Liokin_Maid dusts Cuttershy
<sagas> bet
<Ilchymis> Slenderman emits an anti-electronic EMP field... I thought everyone knew that.
<Ponies47> brb
<Very_Silly_Filly> You know Slenderman is impossible to defeat when even my artillery sets don't have any effect
<Cuttershy> he he he that tickles :D
<Kandarihu> Guys, that's not EMP. If it were EMP, that camera would be dead forever.
<sagas> Ilchymis: They will be the first to go when we all get lost in the woods
<Alchemist> Ilchymis: ANTIelectronic EMP?
<Lil_B> maybe Slenderman has a lot of Magnets
<MaidSurge> sagas: he pops out, he says "a winner is you" and bam, game over :D
<sagas> Kandarihu: Its a static interference signal, likely radiation
<Kandarihu> sagas, okay. That makes sense.
<Ilchymis> I know Alchemist, it was redundant.
<Michael> cool page
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Isn't Slenderman from Silent Hill?
<Eli> Runing thrugh a dark forest with a dead flashligt is a dream of mine^^
<MegaMoonShine> He's only got 2 pages?
<Cuttershy> a lot of users!
<sagas> Also doesnt help that Slenderman is imortal. You cant kill him, only run
<MegaMoonShine> I don't think so Maid_Discord :S
<Michael> right behinf you :D
<Kandarihu> Calling that an EMP is like seeing a harmless little pop that makes a loud banging sound and proclaiming BAYSPLOSIONS!
<sagas> :D
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'd be fine in this situation. I'd be heavily armed
<Michael> *behind
<sagas> he died
<Liokin_Maid> -lol XD Book it man!

<dinky> Fuck god please no
<Chrysalis> MaxTheBrony well she is the target audience
<DoctoDoctorWho> IF he was Id shoot him
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Kandarihu> So, Justin Bieber is a brony. Are we that bitter about his music that we won't welcome him into the herd?
<derpy_pony> he is the chieftain of the bronies
<dinky> ...yes
<MaidSurge> Chrysalis: A+! BRA-VO! :D
<GabeMaid> Kandarihu, yes
<Chrysalis> why do people keep getting her gender wrong?
<Wrek> 05Kandarihu: most would say yes

<Liokin_Maid> Wrek: I would say yes. I hate him more than sin. I wish he would die.
<RainBowJack> JB is always welcome to join our herd
<DJNilla> 06Liokin_Maid <3
<MaxTheBrony> Yer
<dinky> We don't want a bunch of 11 year old girls joining us... It would ruin our culture
<MaidSurge> Ponies47: not true :D
<red_ony> so much about love and tolerance, hu?
<GabeMaid> Liokin_Maid, that's a bit extreme
<MaxTheBrony> haha dinky
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Ponies47> MaidSurge: Good
<Chrysalis> red_ony love and tolerance only goes so far
<Maid_RainBowJack> yeah maid time
<Liokin_Maid> GabeMaid: No. Thats not extremem enough.
<dinky> Wasn't really a joke
<DoctoDoctorWho> love and tolerance HAS limits u know...

<MaxTheBrony> Heya Michael
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: he wouldnt be a brony, hes too busy showing off
<Jim> hai Michael
<Ponies47> Hey Michael
<Chrysalis> i always think this intro is halo
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Don't take the seriously.
<Kandarihu> dinky, an 11 year old girl is part of the core demographic of MLP. He wouldn't affect them anyway.
<alexxm> hey Michael what have you been up to
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03...Hells to the yeah.
<Wrek> 05for some accepting JB into the herd is like saying that what hitler did was right
<Jim> ViVi music show is best stream.
<Maid_RainBowJack> Flutter Wonder
<Metronome> Oh gosh...
<Wrek> 05just saiyan
<Derpdash> Not Beiber!
<CountDoofus> DJNilla: Ich liebe dich <3
*Michael hugs MaxTheBrony Jim alexxm Ponies47
<red_ony> Chrysalis: Some would say the same about bronies
<Metronome> JB BBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRNNNNNNNNNNNNN
<Metronome> jk
<MaxTheBrony> Wrek: xD lol
<Liokin_Maid> Wrek: Good to see were on the same page. Then :3
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninja_Maid_Discord: what he wouldnt do for PR
<Michael> alexxm: repairing some pcs :D
<derpy_pony> if you joined the bronies to look cooler, you made something wrong anyway
<Ponies47> Wrek: /)
<alexxm> ok Michael
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Wrek: But being a corporate whore is more moral than exterminating people based on race.
<dinky> Yeah. Have you seen how they act? we are quite mature, they would bring us down to the lowest level
<killerpony7733> Liokin_Maid: I agree more or less too
<Chrysalis> you dont join the herd to be cool
*DJNilla hugs CountDoofus
<CountDoofus> JB? ... Justin Bie- AW HELL NAW!
<MaxTheBrony> What would happen if Rebecka black came out and said she likes MLp ?
<Chrysalis> you do it to be 20% more awesome
<MaidSurge> Ninja_Maid_Discord: good point!
<Michael> ^
<Ilchymis> I have nothing against JB however him openly bring a brony would bring us into the spotlight causing a WHOLE LOT of teeny-bopper girls to join us which I believe would cause us to fall into a hole of bitching about unimportant hogwash. I love this song by the way.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ill let the haters keep their prejudice opinions so long as I dont have to watch twilight
<Barbetos> Which version of flutterwonder is this?
<Chrysalis> and to be a part of the single best fanbase ever made!
<MaxTheBrony> Ilchymis: True !
<GabeMaid> What if Beiber is Hitler reincarnated as a musician?
<Kandarihu> I don't have any love for his music either. But he's a nice guy. Frankly, I think being a brony suits him just fine.
<DJNilla> 06Original~
<MaxTheBrony> Kandarihu: Agreed :)
<XylemTube> Hi o/
<Dj_Cyber-4G> FLUTTERWONDER!
<alexxm> since when was bieber a brony
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01I don't care who becomes a brony. Just don't ruin it like greedy businessmen have ruined gaming.
<MaxTheBrony> Heya XylemTube
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<XylemTube> Is that flutterwonder i hear?
<CountDoofus> DJNilla: liebe dich platonically, of course ;)
<B-Y> I got a letter by the Princess! "Dear Bronies, banish JB if you love and tolerate the world."
<Wrek> 05Ninja_Maid_Discord: not arguign it, im just sayign that some see it with the same dicu
<Metronome> If JB join the herd bronyfandom will get a bad name
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01I know Wrek.
<Ilchymis> Have I disconnected?
<Ilchymis> Yes, I have.
<Chrysalis> Ninja_Maid_Discord http://thedoghousediaries.com/4443
<MaidSurge> DJNilla loves good music <3
<derpy_pony> Metronome: the brony fandom has a bad name
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Some people would choose Hilter over Bieber.
<MaxTheBrony> Metronome: The brony fandom already have a bad name :(
<GabeMaid> Hilter
<MaxTheBrony> Just look at Fox "news"
<Barbetos> Huh it is the original. I listen to the sogreatandpowerful one to much apparently XD
<Allegr0> Ninja_Maid_Discord: Not all gaming....just most of it ;)
<Michael>
<Michael> hai XylemTube
<Jim> wub
<XylemTube> whats this one?
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Chrysalis: You know what's funny? The T-Club. It's a subscription service for Tetris.
<derpy_pony> what are we watching this night? die hard and star wars?
<Chrysalis> what the actual buckl
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01And guess who thought that idea up?
<GabeMaid> Ninja_Maid_Discord, wat?
*Ponies47 Dances like there is no tomorrow
<Chrysalis> my rage overflowsd
<Kandarihu> MaxTheBrony, that's only one show. Gee, if Fox News were to do a positive story on us, I'm sure we're going to go through the same fits over Justin Bieber, aren't we?
<alexxm> Ninja_Maid_Discord but tetris is free online
<Michael> star wars? that could be great
<dinky> We have a bad name to the general public, but across the internets... not that bad of a name to be honest
<Derpdash> What song is this?
<Chrysalis> seriously, things like that make me otarage all over the place
<red_ony> Hating someone because of the music he does..strikes me as something my 13 year old self would do and relly immature...Personally I don't take this whole love and tolerance seriously that this cumminity has going..yet I can't say I hate anybody..
<Kandarihu> And by positive story, I meant on their daytime shows, not a dinky little comedy show during watershed hours.
<Obsidian> Hello everypony
<Jim> hai Obsidian

<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01If you get it on the iPhone, you can get a subscription service for extra XP for tetris.
<Chrysalis> hiya Obsidian
<Michael> hai Obsidian
<Chrysalis> xp for tetris
<alexxm> how you doing Obsidian
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Powered by EA!
<GabeMaid> Ninja_Maid_Discord, Why would you need XP for Tetris?
<MaxTheBrony> Kandarihu: hmm true , but what i meant was , Every one that hates the brony Culture thinks every Brony is a Clopper or a No lifer .
<Obsidian> Not bad.
*Chrysalis eye twitches
<Jim> Eew, EA
<GabeMaid> Goddammit EA
<Metronome> Could some1 tell me wht bad names did the bronyfandom get?
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01EA is milking Tetris.
<DJNilla> 06Triplets <3
<derpy_pony> hating justin bieber is just another marketing thing..."there is no such thing as bad pr"...you pretend to hate him, but you talk about him, make other people talk about him, you are hosts of a viral campaign, haters. congratulations
<Allegr0> red_ony: its not even his music. That guy has a reputation for being a homophobis jackass. My finace's cousin saw him at a restaurant and he was being the biggest douche, shouting racial explatives at anyone who didn't do everything he asked for
<dinky> I used to think you were all clopers
<GabeMaid> That's a new low right there EA
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01They've been doing it for a long time.
<Dj_Cyber-4G> brony music is BOSS!
<Michael> Allegr0: who?
<MaxTheBrony> Kandarihu: Now that i think if it i dont know what that had anything with what you just said D: ( my recent answer makes no sence)
<Allegr0> Michael: bieber
<Chrysalis> i hate to be a hipster
<red_ony> Allegr0: So? There are plenty of idiots in this world..
<Jim> Once I think EA has gotten to the bottom, they do something like that
<Chrysalis> but games were better before they were popular
<Bronysith> Ninja_Maid_Discord: just when i think EA hit bedrock....they go deeper
<Chrysalis> they were still games
<Dj_Cyber-4G> i wish people would let me play it in my club
<Chrysalis> not wallets
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Hi Allegr0
<dinky> EA is actually PAYING people to join origin...
<Allegr0> red_ony: yeah, but that combined with his crappy music....I just don't blame anyone for hating the guy :P
<dinky> xD
<Allegr0> Ninja_Maid_Discord: hey :)
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01dinky: Seriously?
<Michael> lol
<Jim> Chrysalis, IKR, because when they get real popular. they seem to try to milk all the money then can get out from it
<Chrysalis> the guy i had an interview with today worked on wipeout for the ps1 and the DFS:unleashed
<Chrysalis> he HATED working on NFS
<dinky> Yep, i played the monopoly hotels game (due to ponys) and they give out the curency if you join it xD
<Dj_Cyber-4G> EUROBEAT BRONY?
<Chrysalis> even developers hate the current game market thats how bad it is
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Chrysalis: Because of publishers that abuse them?
<red_ony> there will always be older titles..
<Chrysalis> Ninja_Maid_Discord yeah, and the lack of creativity thats allowed
<Chrysalis> developers used to make games
<Jim> now this is funky
<Chrysalis> now they follow task lists
<Michael> lovely music
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Market needs to crash.
<XylemTube> This sounds familliar
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Thought it is.
<Chrysalis> the rise of gaming has ruined it for gamers and developers alike
*Ponies47 Dances
<Michael> more crashes?
<Allegr0> Ninja_Maid_Discord: that and the fanbases that feel they're owed something for being fans of a game series
*Jim spins
<Michael> damn
<Chrysalis> only problem is complain and your out of a job
<Wrek> 05which is why i love the whole kickstarter thing
<dinky> SUUUUUUPERRRMANNNNNNN 666666666666664444444444444444
<Wrek> 05and the indie market
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Me too Wrek.
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01I think indie and kickstarter is the future.
<Chrysalis> im hoping greenlight takes off
<Wrek> 05to show that we dont want your fucking market AAA generic FPS games
<red_ony> Allegr0: You mean like some entitled bronies? :D
<GabeMaid> What kickstarter thing?
<derpy_pony> billions of unemployed video game developers will spit into your shake at mcdonalds after the market crash
<Chrysalis> indie games for steam
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Because greedy publishers that are exploiting the market are killing gaming.
<Maid_Major> Ninja_Maid_Discord: o_O
<Allegr0> red_ony: entitled everything...the world is way to grabby nowadays ;)
<Jim> Wrek, I love how Steam is allowing Indie developers to just release their games for steam, if the community votes highly enough for their games
<DoctoDoctorWho> "what? yeah, I ship ponies." *drives delivery van for hasbro*
<MaxTheBrony> Jim: Yeah that is awesome
<Wrek> 05steams system for allowing games is fucked up
*Malavolent dances to the rhytm.
<Chrysalis> there are rumours of a Reddit like karma system for game rating
<MaxTheBrony> Wrek: Is it?
<Allegr0> Jim: everything that happens in greenlight is also being reviewed by them, though
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Publishers are crashing the market.
<Nerom> let us only play good games like bastion and other indiegames
<Chrysalis> to ensure that all games get a fair chance
<derpy_pony> the publishers deliver what the customer pays for. 95% of the video games never make a profit. the other 5% get cloned
<Allegr0> Jim: so good indie games not voted by the community still have a shot, its not like survivor, etc :P
<dinky> SUUUUUUUUUPEEERRRMEAAAAATBOY
<Jim> hmm
<MaxTheBrony> so gaming industry is not a good line of work? or is it just hard to make it?
<Chrysalis> MaxTheBrony both atm
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01I would stay out of the gaming industry.
<Wrek> 05raidign at the same time ill explain in a bit
<Allegr0> MaxTheBrony: its still good, just changing
<Chrysalis> they are incredibly tough to make
<derpy_pony> gaming industry is a hit business. like movies
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Until it crashes.
<Chrysalis> all the fun has been sapped out of it
<Allegr0> MaxTheBrony: becoming more corporate and introducing a bit more red tape
<alexxm> well its hard to make it in every indrustry
<Chrysalis> and the stuff that comes out the end is designed by committee garbage
<MaxTheBrony> Dammit ;( im going to start Gamedesign (college/ gymnasium)
<Kandarihu> Well, there's the indie gaming market.
<MaxTheBrony> ..
<dinky> Barbershop cortet
<MaxTheBrony> Im screwd
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01MaxTheBrony: Go indie.
<Chrysalis> Kandarihu indie is incredibly risky thoguh
<Allegr0> Ninja_Maid_Discord: I don't think it'll ever crash again...xbox, guitar hero and angry birds decided that :P
<Nerom> well this is kinda good
<Allegr0> Ninja_Maid_Discord: whether we like it or not :P
<alexxm> intresting cover
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01So you don't get forced to make changes to your game such that I won't buy it.
<derpy_pony> MaxTheBrony: the market is overrun by ambitious new developers
<Michael> brb
<Chrysalis> Allegr0 angry birds is the CAUSE of the current crash
<Chrysalis> guitar hero has shut down
<dinky> Honestly, thats what im planing on doing
<derpy_pony> most of them will fail
<Jim> now THIS is funky oo
*kirzstryfe noms on DJNilla <3
<Chrysalis> and the xbox is incredibly out of date now
<Dj_Cyber-4G> YOU ARE A GREAT SONG PICKER!
<Ilchymis> Yay, my internet is back!
<MaxTheBrony> derpy_pony: But that is cool , that pushes me more to make good games
<Nerom> rockband was better anyway
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Angry Birds is not crashing the market.
<Barbetos> So who made this one?
<Allegr0> Chrysalis: well it's not exactly crashing, we're just entering the tail end of the current console cycle
<Chrysalis> no, but it caused a HUGE push towards the mobile market
<MaidSurge> This song got swag :$
<CountDoofus> Suddenly I have a whole new appreciation for barbershop quartet.
<Allegr0> Chrysalis: what NPD numbers can't show you is how rediculously well indie and PC game sales have been doing
<MaxTheBrony> yey :D
<dinky> Yay
<MaxTheBrony> Avast flutter shy
<red_ony> yay :(
<XylemTube> YAY
<MaidSurge> Avast Fluttershy's ass!
<derpy_pony> MaxTheBrony: you have to commit your life. and even then you have no guarantee that you succeed. it's hard work
<Derpdash> all i hear is yay... O.O
<Maid_RainBowJack> DAT ASS
<Derpdash> Always...
<dinky> Its anus now
<DoctoDoctorWho> Boo yah!
<Chrysalis> if theres one thing i hate, its mobile gaming
<dinky> xD
<Maid_RainBowJack> I Dont
<Malavolent> Chrysalis: Why?
<CountDoofus> Is DJNilla taking requests?
<MaxTheBrony> derpy_pony: I will do that for the sake of the future xD
<dinky> I like moble gaming
<MaidSurge> I I I I DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T
<Chrysalis> i hate it more than bieber
<dinky> Kinda
<Dj_Cyber-4G> AVAST FLUTTERSHY'S ASS?
<Ilchymis> You ofc mean "Avast, it be Fluttershy's plot!"
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Mobile gaming is not killing the industry.
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01That's a change if anything.
<dinky> Yeah
<alexxm> its just a change like from cartridges to discs
<Barbetos> Vafrous Coyote befriends Eurobeat Brony - Giggle at the Ghostie Found it!
<Chrysalis> except the platform is far far worse
<MaidSurge> AAAAAAAaaaaaaa <3
<Chrysalis> in every way
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01EA-like publishers are ruining those games all the same.
<Nerom> Well many don't approve the gameing on mobiles
<dinky> In your opinion
<Chrysalis> less power, less finesse
<derpy_pony> MaxTheBrony: good luck :)
<Malavolent> I don't get it. What are you guys complaining about?
<Chrysalis> and the most god-awful control system ever invented
<Wrek> 05the problem plaguing the indie market is funding though
<Wrek> 05henceforth kickstarters are awesome
<Allegr0> Ninja_Maid_Discord: luckily not enough to completly destroy franchises. The fact that mass effect was mostly untouched was a miracle
<Maid_RainBowJack> Alex S Glith theme
<Nerom> indeeed wrek
<dinky> in your opinion
<Ponies47> awwwwwwwwwwww (squee)
<dinky> I love this song
<Ponies47> I LOVE THIS!
<Allegr0> Ninja_Maid_Discord: really bioware in general remaining uunaffected :P
<XylemTube> I blast this song out of my car every day
<XylemTube> Load like
<Chrysalis> Allegr0 me3 was incredibly hurt, the ending was appalling
<AttacktheMaid> Every brony needs to listen to this song.
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01Isn't Bioware considered dead now?
<Allegr0> Chrysalis: I wouldn't say so
<Chrysalis> because they wouldnt sink the time into making a decent one
<Ponies47> AttacktheMaid: I do. It's epic!
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01EA kind-of ruined them.
<Chrysalis> Allegr0 i put 400+ hours over the series
<Barbetos> Alex S <3
<Metronome> Nykkes64 was fast
<MaidSurge> AttacktheMaid: title please
<Chrysalis> those endings, were appalling
<Wrek> 05onyl the part of bioware that worked mostly on SWTOR
<Ninja_Maid_Discord> 11,01From Ashes and the ending lead EA to win Worst Company in America.
<AttacktheMaid> Ponies47: Exactly.
<Allegr0> Chrysalis: also, think of this: How many games have you finished that you loved that you remember specifically for the ending. Fallout 3/vegas? Skyrim? Mario games? They don't have good endings
<Wrek> 05i mean come on
<Maid_RainBowJack> ME3 Ending SUCKED B*YAY*
<Ponies47> AttacktheMaid: /)
<Wrek> 05EA are worse than the bank of amuriica
<Allegr0> Chrysalis: but the game is still amazing
<Chrysalis> i never enjoyed mario
<XylemTube> Eargasm right here
<Chrysalis> yeah the endings wernt great
<Wrek> 05i will never be able to play ME3 and finish the story duee to origin
