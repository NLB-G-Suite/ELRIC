<DrWhooves> Àllo, everypony. I`d say I'm excited for season 2 ep1 but I've already seen the entirety of season 2. And 3. Well, seasons 2-46 to be honest. Not really, though, but that's how many seasons are made. By then, ponies overwhelm humans in population, so the life of the show becomes real and a new series is started with the real life renditions of the ponies.
<james> Queensland for the win

<prancypants> don't overdo it bronyguy
<Denied_Existence> 3Hi RAWRity
<DesertRose> Reminds me of the pre-wwII computers which took up an entire aircraft hanger
<Magneto> I wonder, if they used some 3rd party program to build these things in Minecraft? They surely didn't run around and put the blocks piece by piece.
<Ghosties> 4Sent a PM to interior_gummy
<KanyeEast> this is still less hardcore than the guy who made a whole computer in minecraft
<ctrlx_laptop> Sir_Hoofalot, any relation to sir-tommy-hooves?
<The_Mole> RAWRity - Have you played the full version? The free version is not much to talk about
<Apokalipse> I'd say my body is ready too, but it's only 13 minutes after midnight and I'm already feeling sleepy
<FlaschenJoe11> 0Winter Wrap-Up!

<Denied_Existence> 3These minecrafters have WAY too much time on their hands...
<FlaschenJoe11> 0just imagine how long it took to build this
<Dumori> asking my skype RPG group their IRC names as we set up via here a good few months back so are all regs
<Bjornfot> we can do it,Apokalipse!
<Thunder_Dash> Though considering how annoying Endermen are I wouldn't bother even if I could >.>

<Denied_Existence> 3I just realized that those lyrics are all a logical paradox
<Jazmyn> dreeeeeeEEeeeEEEeEeeEEeEeeeEeEeeEeEEeeeEEesssssss
<trebthegamer> it would be madness
<Dumori> I've been using IRC for ages but yeah it made me think of Ghosties too
<Drakmoth> 0hmm
<Dark_Heart> MORE MORE
<WhatPayne> This chat is slower that what I would expect from 320 ponies...
<prancypants> yeah, I'm pretty sure those dresses are pro bono
<Ratlan> Well you don't want to make it too much cooler, then it starts losing it's other aspects.
<Natleyn> YES
<Drakmoth> 0Lol? Elektro?
<TNV> 0Now play Winter Wrap up!!!!

<Razyn> I thought Ghosties when I saw it too :3
<Anonsi> Give it time
<FallSilently> I was in the theatre a moment ago, it was working fine earlier. 'Course the six rooms option wasn't there a few hours ago.

<Drakmoth> 0yep
<Bjornfot> derpslow
<prince-dari> Just got something to say quickly.
<Denied_Existence> 3Oh?
<RobotPinkie> There should totally be something like bots on IRC, in my honor of course.
*Silverscreen 11will brb for a moment. Setting up. :D
<CosmicChan> frezezy pony?
<mib_pn9lfz> lol, No one uses this chat
<prince-dari> If you refresh the theatre page you will see our new room setup.
<CosmicChan> =D
<Dumori> you get IRC bots
<Bjornfot> >mfw there is
<RobotPinkie> I know :P
<RandomExtra> Yes, it would. Although I do have 1 sock puppet nickname that's just for the sake of 1 joke.
<lunamoonie> hey every pony!
<DaveKenroy> I couldn't get over the fact that she "beat" the Diamond Dogs into submission by whining.
<prince-dari> It allows you to join one of our main6 rooms and joins you to this room.
<Lagmobile> post link...
<Denied_Existence> 3Do not adjust the dial, we are now in control of your television screen.
<lunamoonie> hello?
*Dumori is an IRC bot or might as well be
<zephiris> RBD!
<DaveKenroy> And that it was viewed as a strength by Twilight in her letter to Princess Celestia.
<RobotPinkie> I'm thinking of writing one, TBH, since I saw that you can write XChat scripts in Python
<RandomExtra> And He's not even connected at the moment.
<Denied_Existence> 3We control the horizontal, we control the vertical.
<prince-dari> This room will eventually be throttled, restricting how often you can post messages, because if we get more than 1000+ people in here this will be out of control.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 we are assuming control....
<Kaine> GOD. ART OF THE DRESS?
<Kaine> AGAIN
<mib_o4cgsw> wtf
<Natleyn> Double song?
<Ghosties> 4Yes, hello
<Sim> Dash is best pony.
<DashWithRainbows> wow this chat is popular....
<RobotPinkie> So no one will ever know when I'm idle...
<Angel_Wings> Fluttershy room ftw
<DashWithRainbows> i can just see all the spam
<Ghosties> 4Welcome to the Rainbow_Dash room
<prince-dari> So the main 6 rooms will be unrestricted, but you can only be in one of the 6 rooms at a time.
<Denied_Existence> 3Dont correct me Va! I can fail if I want to!
<Rinz> lol
<trebthegamer> booyah
<Natleyn> Riiiight, tabs...
<zephiris> woo
<Ratlan> One of the few times Pinkie is incorrect about something
<DaveKenroy> Rarity's still a great character on the show, just not my favorite after that
<prince-dari> That's pretty much it.
<Dumori> new rooms
<BronyGuy> Yay! There's more people in this room!
<MetalRainbowDash> Had to do something.
<prince-dari> Thanks for listening to me everyone.

<Parchment_Scroll> From mibbit.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 this main chat is basically a "hey let's give a shoutout to everyone"
<DragonRage> Applejack Room is tempting.
<DashWithRainbows> not excited for season 2? then your not a brony
<ntonio9> It needs to be about 20% cooler.
<SuperBrony64> prince-dari: Is this what the numbers were for :P

<BronyGuy> Yes, I love everythiiiiiiiiiing!
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> 0anyone know where I can find the version of this with a tough sounding guy singing

<Bronychic> Can't wait till the episode!
<vacuumal> still can't get into the rooms when I restarted the browser.

<SirHoofalot> vlc plays everything
<lunamoonie> ha ha. ikr/
<Ratlan> Try a different browser maybe? seemed to work for someone.
<dastrdlyW> She'd only learned about them, not that she didn't know they existed.
<TNV> I just love how pinkie says "party" in this song xD
<SuperBrony64> I love Pinkie Pie's invitation song :D
<BronyGuy> It won't be the same without you So we hope that you say yes

<FlaschenJoe11> Singing Telegram is a nice song
<SirHoofalot> and I mean EVERYTHING

<Vanuatu> I got the telegram Pinkie.
<AllisZero> The website works on Chrome, but not Firefox apparently
<DashWithRainbows> would be on brnystate chat but so many people
<Lasharus> I got that same issue. I suspect that they're working on fixing it, or confused because they CAN use it. :P
<Angel_Wings> :)
<Sim> same voice actor... i know... but wow, having a shy and pinkie song back to back really points it out
<Graffy_Hooves> 0Pinkie Pie is best pony
<DashWithRainbows> bronystate*
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> 0WITH MAGNETOOOOOOOO
<Polarfire> Oh. you guys made those already... I see.

<WhatPayne> manually the http://bronystate.net/theatre/<pony name> works

<Natleyn> inb4juicy
<Dumori> I really should code this auto join with a shorter delay on kick
<Dumori> as that was stupid
<Spectrum> this chat is in a rather inconvenient position.
<GoldenSandslash> I know one in real life.
<Silverscreen> 11How are you preparing to do so?
<Flutteryay> Yup
<GoldenSandslash> Most via Internet though
<Razyn> What is this (the best) channel for?
<MrChang> VULCANOO!!!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol dunno. Dari did all of the structuring for that :P
<GameFreak> Will this stream be in HD?
<Frubban> omg
<GabeMoist> AAWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAH
<lunamoonie> we should watch the pony anthology, clean version
<mariomarc> hey guys i tried the new website, but the theatre buttons don't work
<The_Si> My cousins are into MLP now.
<LunaFanatic> something about the red soldier being sent to equstrian
<RAWRity> so can I aska questiong to everyone here? What is the magneto joke? IDGI
<Drakmoth> omg...
<Lagmobile> i got to irl brony friends
<Fallen> is there possibly an issue with adblock programs and choosing rooms?
<Hawattie> Half of my friends are bronies, half of them think i'm insane
<SuperBrony64> Uhoh
<Lasharus> Heh.
<Natleyn> I have a group of brony friends.
<WhatPayne> But what's the diference? Does it has something to do with the IRC channel?
<RandomExtra> (and probably for other reasons that I'm not network-savvy enough to know)
<PacGamer> nooo spoilers!
<SuperBrony64> SPOILER ALERT!
<LunaFanatic> true
<NewDCD> 9well

<Angel_Wings> hahahahaha
<Jon> What.
<SuperBrony64> What?!
<Dark_Heart> WHAT

<NewDCD> 9you'll see something new on the mane chat later
<Flutteryay> I love Twilight. If you told me a year ago that I would say that I'd look at you like u told me I eat poopie
<Lasharus> Splitting it up into six channels at least makes sure that people can follow the conversation. Somewhat.
<Luna> 07Warm welcome you all :)
<Silverscreen> 11So how are you all preparing for it?
<Zephirdd> that is not unrealistic
<Zephirdd> lol
<LunaFanatic> so we could talk a bit. if thats okay with you...
<NewDCD> 9hold on to your horses
<Robikku> I'm sorry, twilight, I missed that...what?
<trebthegamer> mine has the mane6 launched to TF2
<pmv_is_best_mv> the show is ruined!
<Fallen> i could get the channels to appear, but i can't get anything to happen when i click a channel picture
<ValtheJean> 2,14 as I understand it, it was an advertisement during the bronychat stream

<ValtheJean> 2,14 outside of that, I have no idea
<Lasharus> I'm willing to bet that there are some insane people who'll have all 6 channels open, of course.
<Dermathil> >mfw not much more people present in chat
<TNV> Do you think there will be need of more rooms when S2 is starting?
<SuperBrony> Chillin.
<Razyn> Dividing the chat by six was very wise
<Natleyn> I'd only eat these if they got me to Equestria.
<Luna> 07Less spam amd less speedy chat
<BronyGuy> Chips. Nice and salty
<Silverscreen> 11Nice.

<GabeMoist> Fluttershy is catching bears
<Drakmoth> Oh oke ill come to you then and step in Fluttershy
<MidnightMoon> Loved this part of the show :)
<rivets> Fluttershy's dress ends up looking like French haute couture, which looks like garbage. She knows how to sew, that doesn't mean she has good taste
<Jon> We need more flutterrage in s2.
<Flameshy> :3
<lunamoonie> XD
<a041744> Confound it loading!
<SuperBrony> Coolio.
<Aponymous> 0This is literally my first time here. Sorry.
<BronyGuy> I love this music!
<RAWRity> grundle she knows a lot about MAKING dresses, not designing. It's one thing to know the technical aspects of creating something, it's another to be able to design something pleasing to the eye
*stripes noms Silverscreen 's pizza
<Xzite> awesome BGM
<mib_mllllm> lol says wrek you spammed as well

<EspyLacopa> Twilight is rather good at winking.
<MetalRainbowDash> Bak
<Sockis> 0I love the music when Pinkie goes all psycho
<SuperBrony> Starting with the same "My Little Pony Melody" but then change into something new.
<twilightisbestpony> The BGM on this show is just fantastic.
<rainbowcrash> so i typed the join command and then #fluttershy. am i doing it right?
<Kaine> ^There will be a extended one.

<SuperBrony64> Oh boy…what happens if they come out with a MLP:FiM Movie in theaters?
<RandomExtra> It is epic.
<Blu3Ealges> Well, there's be a lot of heated trolling. But mostly just arguing over which is best.
<BronyGuy> Honesty!
<Windblow> I'm using Google chrome
<RobotPinkie> Aw man, I really like the "End of Harmony" comic on EqD
<Dermathil> how are you today man?
<Shadow> and find the http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/Rainbow-light.swf

<mib_0kpjja> Time for low quality...

<LunaFanatic> kind of sad that nearly all fanfiction involving Nightmare moon as a seperate entity despict her as an evil tyrant
<Drakmoth> RAWRity nuu if he likes flutter shy then #Fluttershy is better
<lunamoonie> hm...i had no problem at all, thats wierd.
<SuperBrony64> I'm gonna have to man it up and go to see it
<SuperBrony> Cool.
<Silverscreen> 11SirReginald: That's what the drink's based off off.

<Spectrum> ^
<Vergil> Superbrony: A very awkward theatre setup.
<Magneto> The stream needs more leverage!
<BronyGuy> Loalty!
<Lasharus> And Loyalty, naturally.
<lunamoonie> yeah, but uh, im on the luna republic...tee hee
<Wrek> 05nyx, please make sure you are at bronystate.net

<Natleyn> I'm sorry to hear that, DoctorValor.
<Shadow> might just be my firfox being derped
<Lasharus> Close, but not quite BronyGuy :P
<GoldenSandslash> My opinion: Twilight > Rainbow > Rarity > Fluttershy > Pinkie > Applejack
<NightmareNyx> nyx are you on bronystate.net?
<NewDCD> 9steram is working fine. Try the popout http://www.owncast.tv/embed.php?u=Wild%20Dance%20of%20Machine%20God&vw=700&vh=585
<Vergil> 16-30+ males on one side, the other side little girls with their parents.
<Windblow> 11What's that?
<trebthegamer> i'd say she was under some kind of magic not from equestria
<SuperBrony64> inb4 Rainbow blast

*Ratlan hugs Windblow

<prince-dari> That link probably won't work just by itself DCD
<NightmareNyx> works fine for me
<Blu3Ealges> I would never have guessed. What with your name being themed to the sun and all. xD
<RAWRity> drakmoth you say that, but then Art of The Dress happened.
<LGNR> Oops, sorry

<SirReginald> lol
<MidnightMoon> Np, i have a hard time spelling sometimes too
<Lasharus> Quite all right BronyGuy. I'm a linguist so I tend to get grammar-nazi at times.
<SuperBrony64> And they never wear that jewlery again...
<Natleyn> WhatPayne: I know Chrome checks the page source for updates every once in a while, but since Firefox has the Reload Frame option, it checks it less often
<trebthegamer> escuse me?
<Drakmoth> nehh we all have diffrent opinions RAWRity so there is no best pony
<Dark_Heart> taste the rainbow
<Robikku> TASTE IT

<stripes> yay
<SirDerpsalot> Why so many Sirs?
<Meanwhile> Tastes like skittles.

<Lagmobile> Lyra is best pony
<Jon> thats her back right.
<Ratlan> o.O
<FlutterBro13> The_Watcher is EVERYWHERE
<DaveKenroy> I really hope they have a Celestia based episode in Season 2
<Lagmobile> or colgate
<BronyGuy> I'm a GRAMMER-nazi, I just fail at spelling, especially when typing fast.
<WhatPayne> Can I ask a question?
<rainbowcrash> did rainbow dash's eyes just derp?
<Luna> 07sure
<Colgate> Damn straight
<FlaschenJoe11> The Bitchprince
<LunaFanatic> oh noez
<Drakmoth> the prince is rude

<SirHoofalot> I'm still deciding whether or not I'm going to go te sleep :D
<RobotPinkie> Absolutely vile stuff
<MidnightMoon> same here, actually
<Lagmobile> INTO THE GALA

<Lagmobile> METAL THINGS
<Lasharus> You realise I will have to end you for that BronyGuy?

<Meanwhile> It's not.
<Snail3_pro> Brony state
<Flutteryay> Really? How so?
<WhatPayne> Um. Doesn't this system disperse people somewhat?
<Slowter> Yes
<Jon> Question?
<EmmettBrown> Because Aquafrsh has 3,3 in one protection for your family
<rainbowcrash> Lagmobile how do they work though
<BronyGuy> No killing allowed till season 2
<Slowter> whoops nvm
<RobotPinkie> lol that sounds like a very bad idea, GabeMoist
<Lasharus> "He usually skipped the editorials, as he was only prepared to read the word 'however' so many times in a 150-word article."
<D> :P
<Magneto> At the Gala, welcoming ponies to their doom.

<Shadow> :D
<DragonRage> And then /pony/'s Applejack Guy was here! And boy is it dead in this room.
<Dumori> OM nom nom
<RAWRity> so if we can agree on anything, I think it's that Rarity and Fluttershy need a duet in S2
<Luna> 0717 mins
<rainbowcrash> it's narcissism
<SirHoofalot> I'm afraid I'll go to sleep and come back to a stream with zero slots left...
<Ratlan> ^
<Silverscreen> 11VicViper: NO vid links in this channel
<mib_56phiq> k
<Magneto> Twilight's Song-voice is actually another woman.
<Lasharus> Pratchett remains a fantastic author. :P
<WhatPayne> Yeah. That's good I guess...
<Slowter> Tottally
<Snail3_pro> BRONY STATE Y U NO Show Different Videos

<GabeMoist> What would happen with Pinkie on pure caffeine?
<Flutteryay> Well when you have my ex as a boyfriend you get fuckin sick of the word
<DashOrCrash> I have two remixes of this song on my iPod
<Denied_Existence> 3No video links in the mane chat please. Danke Shone

<Dark_Heart> CAUSE TOMORROW SPRING IS HERE!!!
<RobotPinkie> I dunno if I've tried that...
<Natleyn> However, we already have a backlog, so it might not show anyway
<Slowter> a Fluttershy-Rarity duet would be awesome
<LunaFanatic> Hey Luna. Does Bronystate stream the other episodes of season 2?

<MrChang> i hate this crap so much
<Sockis> 0This is so awesome <3
<Xzite> Twilight
<Drake> god i hope they release the good version of this song
<MetalRainbowDash> I like the Alex S. remix
<desertman2> that's why it's a live stream
<Luna> 07Thanks for all the requests everypony
<FlutterBro13> ...
<Frubban> So crappy.
<MrPoniator_> HEY SUPERBRONY
<SuperBrony> Brb Bronies, gonna play some Magicka.
<Flutteryay> Sorry, I'm listening to his fucking broadcast and he just insinuated that Bronies "probe their anal passages" with My Little Pony dolls
<MrChang> this is just embarassing
<Vergil> Poor Applejack.
<Terithian> Epic guitar solo!
*Dumori is embarassed slightly by his IRC client fucking up
<DaveKenroy> So I'm still trying to figure out where the line is of "too much pony"
<RAWRity> somewhere towards the end of this song, there's a point where Scoot's VA cracks up, but it's covered by the music
<Drakmoth> hmm
<Luna> 07I'm preparing to switch to the mane-show soon
<DeadlyPony> YES!!
<Robikku> Oh hus.
<mib_56phiq> Nice sun.
<Slowter> Comedy at it's finist
<wackyteen> I'm so dumb
<SuperBrony64> This a PMV of a Justin Bieber song?
<Robikku> CMC's FTW
<prince-dari> Well all the rooms will probably be full tomorrow, we have 350 people and BMN hasn't even started yet.
<mib_56phiq> Looks menacing.
<Dark_Heart> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Natleyn> Luna, what was that Electro Flutter video? o-o
<DashOrCrash> I swear, most of the music from FIM sounds better in 8-bit
<Flutteryay> No such thing as too much pony
<twilightisbestpony> That line does not exist, dave
<Apokalipse> That makes no sense... I love pony logic"
<rainbowcrash> also totally have a IRC for beginners tab up
*Dumori it's what you get for coding one out of boredem
<wackyteen> i just spoiled part of episode 2 for myself.
<Apokalipse> !
<wackyteen> =(
<Luna> 07I won't play any new requests at this point
<DeadlyPony> Finally, I got off of internet Explorer: STUPID!
<Denied_Existence> 3Owned by Wrek
<RobotPinkie> I love Indian food, I always get the spiciest thing on the menu.
<BronyGuy> There is no line of that sort
<Drakmoth> i would be emberaced if i did that..
<Drakengarde> Okay, I tried to access the room through BronyState.net but absolutely none of the rooms are letting me in
<Sockis> 0It would be awesome with Sweetie Belle singing this song
<prince-dari> This system is untested though, so I'm just working out the problems. <_<
<DeadlyPony> I CAN SEE THE VIDEO :D! YAAAYY!!!
<Lagmobile> DONT TOP BELIVEING!
<Drakengarde> What the heck
<FlutterBro13> yes it does
<Snail3_pro> :(
<DaveKenroy> Has it been crossed when you can recite 6 of Season 1 songs by heart and name 74 of the characters of the show?
<Dumori> spicey is good
<Lagmobile> oops
<FlaschenJoe11> more smoke!
<Xzite> yep. no such line.
<lunamoonie> YEA! rock on!
<Snail3_pro> aw
<Luna> 07Ehmm it was a request :)
<Dumori> most of the time
<Lasharus> ............
<Lagmobile> wrong song :P
<RobotPinkie> They always warn me "no, you don't know what you're doing, whitey"
<Apokalipse> I don't really enjoy spicy...
<Mehpie> Stupid ad in the way
<mib_56phiq> "more steam"
<RainbowBlitz> lulz
<Drake> yes, protect us from the barbarians at the gate prince
<BakedMacintosh> Wasn't there a vid of a bunch of bronies singing this?
<DeadlyPony> Try to use a different browser if your not getting into the rooms :D
<trebthegamer> i swear for a song meant to be bad it's pretty good
<S_E_F> in one shot the hanging things had one eye, the next they had 2
<AdamTheCha> DeadlyPony, what did you do to fix it?
<Natleyn> Darn!
<SirHoofalot> wow
<prince-dari> XD
<AdamTheCha> k
<AllisZero> So is it weird that I'm more stoked for tomorrow than I was for my birthday yesterday?
<RAWRity> wackyteen aw man, that sucks. I've been trying my hardest to stay unspoiled, outside of the non-discord screen shots.
<Natleyn> It's so hard to find x.x
<BronyGuy> nope DaveKenroy
<MrChang> i got kicked because i said this song isn't good?
<Gummy> cmc y do you rouck so hard
<twilightisbestpony> Nope, still not crossed.
<mib_eh4xg3> How do I get to this room via MIRC?
<Blu3Ealges> I love the Alex S. remix of this.
<Caboozles> I hope the stream tomorrow won't be this low of a quality?
<prince-dari> Damn autojoins.
<DeadlyPony> Use a different browser other than Internet explorer
<Luna> 07I know.. i'm not even using mibbit!
<FlaschenJoe11> take the house down
<Ratlan> @AllisZero, nope
<DecapKnight> Am I the only one that can't open stream w/out having my internet derp like a mother fucker?
<desertman2> yes you did
<WhatPayne> So is this room system used from now on, even when there's no hundreds of ppl on line say in weekdays. Or will you revert back to #bronystate?
<Caboozles> Or is it just because it's youtube 'n all?
<Wrek> 05nope, it was the way you said it, and that you repeated yourself
<Gummy> ^
<wackyteen> well i was avoiding spoilers
<Magneto> However...
<Drakengarde> I'm using Firefox. >_>
<SuperBrony> What the heck?
<RandomExtra> I still smell upcoming trolling though... I will be watching closely!
<DaveKenroy> Also, you check EqD about two dozen times a day
<prince-dari> It's just because it's youtube.
<DashOrCrash> For example: this, Winter wrap-up, art of the dress, and the main theme
<Lagmobile> SCRAMOOSH SCARAMOOSH WILL YOU DO THE FANDANGO
<DeadlyPony> For those who cannot see the video, they haven't shown the movie yet
<Hawattie> Hey, could you make the song worse?
<Robikku> It's not meant to be good, Chang
<MetalRainbowDash> MrChang this song is good actually.
<wackyteen> but i somehow have had it happened regardless
<AdamTheCha> I'm using Firefox and I still can't get in, I'll try Chrome
<Shadowx> ^ i just hope they come through with the mobile stream
<prince-dari> The S2 stream is very good quality.
<DragonRage> Ohai, Caboozles.
<Mehpie> Dat running
<Lagmobile> Oops
<MrChang> i said this song is bad
<Robikku> that's the point
<lunamoonie> there is a vid of bronies singing this?
<DashOrCrash> all sound better in 8-bit
<stripes> i use firefox
<MidnightMoon> That just means your a better fan then most of us. or, at least, better then me
<MetalRainbowDash> Even though the voices aren't that good.
<Luna> 07The theme rooms will be used for events
<mib_56phiq> Chrome is beast
<mib_tk6cpn> omgomgomgomg is this the intermission
<MetalRainbowDash> They're OK.
<Lagmobile> sti wrong song
<Robikku> it's meant to be bad
<NoOne> im on chrome and it wont load
<Slowter> Scootaloo, oh Scootaloo!
<Terithian> I'm totally doing air guitar right now.
<RAWRity> right there, before she says "find out who we are"
<twilightisbestpony> That's all? Still not crossed.
<Luna> 07not during weekdays
<SirHoofalot> I didn't know chickens could sing...
<Jon> Its so bad its good.
<prince-dari> <_<
<thegreatandpowerfulp> firefox = best browser
<DeadlyPony> Yes it is
<Peter> say what?
<BakedMacintosh> I recall seing one a few weeks ago
<Flutteryay> Daniel Ingram has a "good version" somewhere
<Denied_Existence> 3Also, trolling tonight (A.K.A. not G4 movie) is curtesy of Bjornfot, who by chance is also the man in charge of the MLP dating sim. Please rage at him and PM him with questions/rage about the sim. Thanks!
<stripes> ..is someoneone gunna comeup with firepony browser
<Dumori> it it doesn't make my cry it's not too spicey :P
<Flutteryay> I wanna hear it
<Ratlan> Ow

<stripes> its a challenge
<Bjornfot> eeeeyup
<LunaFanatic> is it possible that you can make a Luna room? :)
<rainbowcrash> i'm on chrome and I have no idea which room i'm in I said join Fluttershy so I assume I'm there
<Meanwhile> Is it a chrome issue? Do i have to use something else to see the magic?
<Xzite> i thought everypony does that :D
<lunamoonie> i need to see that vid!
<Magneto> This can't be the intermission, because the first movie didn't even start. lol
<Drakmoth> DONT MAKE ME GO TO SLEEP

<Meanwhile> I forget
<MetalRainbowDash> MLP Them ovie

<Natleyn> Lag, wasn't that still on youtube?
<MetalRainbowDash> The movie
<RAWRity> mrponiator it's the MLP movie from 86
<Graffy_Hooves> 12am GMT for first movie. 10 minutes in other words.
<MetalRainbowDash> G1
<Flutteryay> But Twilight is my favorite because I see qualities in her (and APplejack) that I wish I had.
<FlaschenJoe11> Christopher Walken is The Blade Runner
<MrPoniator_> Ah, right
<rainbowcrash> ending music to the series
<WhatPayne> Right-o
<Ratlan> Reminds me of Re: Your Brains
<VioletVanilla> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjtzib0G9Rs&feature=player_embedded
<Dumori> no idea
<MetalRainbowDash> The B movie is from Generation One
<DeadlyPony> Never watched it
<Lagmobile> ya

<VioletVanilla> 6Please :3
<EspyLacopa> Technically, these are videos. From youtube.
<Flutteryay> *Applejack

<BronyGuy> I relate to twilight the best, Always studying with no social life.
<EspyLacopa> I blame the requests being made in Vinyl_Scratch channel.
<twilightisbestpony> Twilight and Applejack are my favorites cause they are the two I relate to best.
<RobotPinkie> Right now it's video, right? Friendship is Power Metal CMC theme instrumental
<Apokalipse> in a yoda mood Dumori is
<Mehpie> I'm in Twi chat cause i like her

<Sockis> 0Galoshes!
<Dumori> Bollywood hummm
<Drakmoth> MLP FiM games created by activision and infinity ward: PROFIT
<RobotPinkie> and no, not the kind of Bollywood that you just pictured in your head
<Fluttershy`> Hello. ^^
<DashOrCrash> or just people pretending to be philosophical
<nah> hopy shit 391 viewers
<MetalRainbowDash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knNvzudycI
<Caboozles> You can see at the top of the chat room...
<RobotPinkie> :P
<LGNR> I never liked Rarity until this episode aired
<DeadlyPony> YEAH! THAT IS MAJOR!
<DSNesmith> my stream, she is broken D:
<Caboozles> Oh god no.
<twilightisbestpony> I wil hug everypony! But mostly Twilight.
<billy> hey guys why is there a channel with all the characrters
<Blu3Ealges> Here comes 20% cooler. xD
<Destroyer> the twilight room has teleport spamming
<The_Observer> I'll have to think on it; but it most certainly won't be applejack
<MrMaxaminus> Gawd, I think if I actually saw Twi in real life I'd start crying.
<DeadlyPony> JESUS RARITY!
<Apokalipse> mine isn't in english
<Crainy> activison sucks
<RAWRity> I believe there was a big troll called "The Observer" in the HP livejournal fandom years back. Turned out it was a sock puppet of one of the big name fans.
<trebthegamer> i'm pretty sure my connection is gonna crash down a few times before season 2
<MetalRainbowDash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knNvzudycI 41-minute video by me
<lunamoonie> yes!
<Caboozles> No Activision/IW pony games...
<mib_x98oi6> how do you watch the movie for movie night?
<Happy-Kah> there are only 11 in applejack, she is the least popular i think :(
<Fluttershy`> Luna is happy yes? XP
<mib_kyn8em> Wow, more than normal eh Wrek?
<LunaFanatic> same as dashorcrash
<desertman2> MRD, No
<BronyGuy> I'll be back in a couple minutes bronies!

<Xzite> oh, 40 people did the right choice :D
<Wrek> 05MetalRainbowDash no youtube links in this chat
<rainbowcrash> so france exists in equestria? or what
<billy> will season 2 be on all of them
<Zecora> well when you think they are tricky try portal prelude
<Luna> 07oh yes
<Lasharus> Like I said - the hugs go without saying.
<Dermathil> Bollywood: indian movie industry
<Caboozles> We don't need Call of Cutie or something stupid like that.
<BakedMacintosh> Streamers!
<RandomExtra> If our chat stuck to Fluttershy, then this place would be blank.
<Crainy> FUCK activison
<mib_56phiq> Poor rarity D:
<Hat> HERE WE GOOOOO
<SirHoofalot> incoming... bracing for impact.
<MetalRainbowDash> Ugh
<Ebon_Dusk> I keep timing out on the high stream -_-
<HoboDash> Ahem
<Drakmoth> Crainy activision helped with CoD4
<Wrek> 05mib_kyn8em quite.
<Drakmoth> Soo
<Caboozles> Well
<Hat> HOW MUCH COOLER?!
<Crainy> exactly

<SuperBrony64> inb4 20% Cooler
<DSNesmith> so, uh, is there a list of rooms somewhere?
<Caboozles> So this'll have to do
<DeadlyPony> 20% cooler
<RAWRity> LGNR I liked rarity, but this episode made me REALLY like her. And then Dog and Pony Show made her my fave
<MetalRainbowDash> It needs to be about 20% cooler.
<Snail3_pro> 20% cooler
<Magneto> It needs to be about 20 % cooler!
<Spazturtle> BakedMacintosh I use Frontpage to make websites for my clients, They don't actualy want good websites.
<Crainy> activison sucks
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> 0!20%
<SirReginald> AAAAAAND There it is.
<NoOne> EVERYPONY SPAM!!
<MrMaxaminus> or the birth of a star
<Slowter> 20% cooler
<Hat> WOOOOOO
<Lasharus> Going by that Xzite - which channel do you guys think will be the emptiest of the six?
<MrMaxaminus> or something
<lunamoonie> it needs to be 20% cooler
<Crainy> worst thing ever
<Xzite> 20%
<Hat> lol
<CrazyPie> aaawww yeaaahhh

<AdamTheChao> *her
<Mew> YAY
<DaveKenroy> Well talking about Luna also brings up a controversial subject. Luna in socks (when it was "in") was almost at the, or above, the adorableness of Twilight
<RainbowBlitz> there it is my favorite line
<ntonio9> It needs to be about 20% cooler.
<Slowter> HAHHAHAhaa
<General_Hazard> 20% :)
<Mehpie> Waht about Pinkie?
<mib_1skj2r> 20% cooler
<Luna> 07will soon get a throttle

<desertman2> it's the names of the mane cast
<LunaFanatic> well this is probably the most calm and friendly chat room
<RainbowDash1> YEAH!! DRESSES!!
<DeadlyPony> Seriously, the chat stopped just to say all that line

<DSNesmith> this is disappointing
<Xzite> i'd second applejack

<Shadowx> caboozles haha

<Fluttershy`> gamemaster257: awesome iphone 4 background ^^
<DaveKenroy> Although, one thing I am debating is whether or not I want to see Trixie in Season two or not. I hated her pride and bragging, but I also want to see her learn from her mistakes

Tonight’s movies are Blade Runner, and thanks your local troll Bjornfot, our second B movie is relevant to the special event, as it’s the horrorfest known as MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOVIE! Based on Generation 1! *gasp*
<Rated-RPonyStar> IT's awseome!
<Shadowx> i only got into fallout once it went onto the xbox
<twilightisbestpony> Wish I could stick around for this, but I can't. I'll be back later, best chat room
<Rated-RPonyStar> It has Harrison ford
<Dermathil> hahahahaah
<Dumori> lets play the guss the cut game....
<MrMaxaminus> This movie is excellent if you're into cerebral cyberpunk movies
<Lasharus> I just haven't seen Blade Runner period DaveKenroy :P
<Caboozles> FO2>FO:NV>FO:BoS>FO>FO3
<Dermathil> the mods are gonna be awesome as usual in main
<MetalRainbowDash> g

<Dumori> you can do it from the opening
<MetalRainbowDash> g
<MetalRainbowDash> g
<MetalRainbowDash> g
<MetalRainbowDash> g
<Denied_Existence> 3*DOUBLEGASP*
<Caboozles> Opinions, of course.
<Dumori> most of the time
<Luna> 07indeed I am
<Rated-RPonyStar> They say that this is what inspired Deus Ex
<DoctorValor> So I kinda get annoyed when I'm running around the starting village and the carnivorous plants start combat with me
<MrMaxaminus> It's a very philisophical movie
<Misha> Never seen it so i will give it a chance. YOu can't really say something is bad unless you've tried it
<Silverscreen> 11Following our mane event, we’re going ALL NIGHT LONG with an ENTIRE MARATHON of MLP Season 1 as a forerunner to….THE SEASON 2 PREMIERE!!!!!!
<Luna> 07sorry i'm having my hands full atm :)
<DaveKenroy> Curse you hunger! Why u no tell me earlier!
<Mehpie> :o Ima wait until MLP the movie god lol
<LunaFanatic> this movie is produced by john fill, the moose director
<Dumori> I think two cuts have the same intro
<ValtheJean> 2,14 inb4 gas-...oh wait
<Sir_Hoofalot> Apparently. *shudder*
<Apokalipse> the what now?
<LGNR> Man, I can't believe I haven't seen this movie yet.
<Shadowx> doctor have you heard of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.?
<RainbroDash> I'll watch it for the luls and the irony. And for sheer sake of comparison.
<Coster156> 0no problem
<General_Hazard> Warning: this movie is kind of boring, mostly due to it being film noir. Just stick with it and you will see the beauty of the film. Now sit back and enjoy the show!
<Dermathil> Dumori: this is the final cut
<ValtheJean> 2,14 :P
<VioletVanilla> 6SEASON 2!!! <333
<chedduhr> and by the way (guessing by the rooms we can choose) can we all agree that pinkie pie is best pony?
<MightyMatrix> mods are talking in main room
<RobotPinkie> Aren't there only two intros?
<Sir_Hoofalot> My body is ready though
<RAWRity> cursing is allowed, but we only get 2 fucks before we have to upgrade to R
<DoctorValor> Yeah.
<Dumori> awwww
<Lasharus> That alone is worth it then. I very much enjoyed Deus Ex. :P
<Bronychic> Never heard of Blade Runner.. -Watches-
<Dermathil> the longest one

<desertman2> Did I see background?
<LGNR> Aw, fuck.
<FlaschenJoe11> did i miss anything
<House> Am I on the right planet?
<Sir_Hoofalot> Pinkie pie is indeed best pony. Unless, of course, Twilight is best pony. Which sometimes happens.
<VioletVanilla> 6Shoo be doo shoop shoo be doo~
<Denied_Existence> 3Umad ValtheJean?
<MrMaxaminus> It's based on the novel "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"
<Frubban> lol

<Apokalipse> and WhatPayne...
<House> >That feel when the real 2019 won't be that cool

<Dark_Heart> dude, this looks like a scene from Star Wars
<Dermathil> This was the thing that the Snatchers ripped half from
<Ratlan> Bit strange but if you click on a link to Bronystate.net, then go to the theatre, it might work?
<Rated-RPonyStar> And this is all thanks to the obama administration
<desertman2> 6 am pst

<GabeMoist> Tacowiz picked the WORST movie in BMN history
<DSNesmith> not even B-movie
<Rated-RPonyStar> G1 is okay....sometimes
<DashOrCrash> I suppose spoilers are not allowed?
<jedimom> anyone else having problems viewing
<DSNesmith> Spider's Web didn't qualify as a movie
<Dermathil> Elky: I remember when we watched NewDCD game through Snatchers
<Wrek> 05what movie?
<jedimom> or is it just too busy
<PrincessCelestia> Soon........
<xGeniPoni> cool. sorry xDD quess i didnt understand when ya'll said before
<Jon> IQ tests have changed alot.

<Spazturtle> What did Tacowiz do again?
<GabeMoist> Spider's Web
<Dermathil> alright thanks Val
<SilverVision> So many bronies
<Silverhooves> in the future eye scanners will use bagpipe technology

<Apokalipse> Wait who guessed there will be 500 people in chat for the premiere?
<Rainbow_derp> i like turtles
<SuperBrony64> Han Solo! SHOOT FIRST!
<House> Jetpacks actually kinda suck
<DoctorValor> Halo 2 was not bad, it was pretty good
<Tehpogo> People keep flamethrowers on their roofs
<SilverVision> HHHHHNNNNNGGG
<RobotPinkie> It'll be even more needed during ponies.
<Aponymous> ohai Han Solo!
<mariomarc> can the answer be the story?
<Wrek> 05for some reason, i get the feelign of syndicate mixed with deus ex here
<RAWRity> perhaps when (if) Sweetie gets her Cutie mark?
<SparkleTwilight> i like how the comments load like ten at a time
<Xzite> 2019*
<Braeburn|TF2> everfreenights, try a different browser to see if it works on that?
<Ebon_Dusk> Hans Solo seems to be stuck on this planet
<Lasharus> You're nearly a thousand years late Xzite.

<DoctorValor> Halo 3 was disappointing however.
<Dumori> mib_6vl8h8 not enougth magic
<Bandages> 'MERICA
<DashWithRainbows> better then walking though
<DoctorValor> Reach is beautiful
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I doubt the CMC ever will

<DSNesmith> Han Solo seems to have lost his badass license in this movie
<kirzstryfe> lol
<PrincessSparklyCuddl> woooo
<Meanwhile> Chewbacca and Short round are the same person.
<xGeniPoni> ^^ okies, thanks, I've never understood timezones that much... and about the singing voices, yessweetie belle should sing more!
<Ratlan> No off-world colonies because no profitability in it.
<Rated-RPonyStar> Wait. That's chinese writing but that guys spoke Japanese...fail
<Elky> I'm worried even six rooms might nt be enough for the premiere
<WhatPayne> Yeah, shooting the questionnaire tends to be read as "failure"...
<FlaschenJoe11> you have a bottle?
<Shadowx> i liked the music
<Vergil> Everfree Nights? Like, The Raccoons?D:
<PrincessCelestia> I think deux ex is inspired by this movie.
<MrPoniator_> SirReginald, it's the same actor
<mib_6vl8h8> Ford Prefect
<Arrakiz> okey the joke's on me
<mariomarc> when did it start?
<pony_yay> WHERS CHEWBACCA
<[NLR]Lucid> Harrison Ford is a very sexy man, if I do say so myself
<coopm0re> HE DOES NT LIKE YOU
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but so long as Sweetie keeps singing, I'll be happy :P
<Shadowx> hb odst?
<story-dreamer> wow, you guys are amazing.
<Magneto> I miss Neocron :/

<Dumori> oh yeah
<Meanwhile> Mousier, look at my moostache.
<Shadowx> yeah
<riverhippo|afk> everytime i see Harrison Ford talk to someone who doesnt understand him I think of Chewie everytime
<Ninja> 0pro typo
<BakedMacintosh> best go now while the plot is still shallow
<Fluttershy`> Graaawwwhhhh
<DoctorValor> Nonetheless still fun to play as an ODST other than a spartan or elite
<trebthegamer> or maybe not in america
<Apokalipse> Looks like we could hit 500 during the movies.
<mib_5nl0wm> Yeah, stream's dead
<Rookeealding> suddenly everyone english

<JojotheDinosaur> Ok so i see yoda...george weasley, bin laden, yodas back, hey osama! O_O
<DSNesmith> Lando, you've lost some weight
<Dumori> for s2 I think it might hit 1000
<cbpony9001> the number shall not be 2 nor 4
<mib_2vm9pw> hai :D
<Razyn> Well, 1000 or so dividing among six shouldn't be too bad
<mib_1skj2r> cookie dough ice cream <3

<SuperBrony64> Spazturtle: Yup.
<JojotheDinosaur> French people have special combs for their mustasches
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the problem is that if they lose their cutie marks, they lose the appeal
<MuNova> So it seems I can't watch the HQ stream lol
<Tovler> Han shot first
<story-dreamer> first time here; this is awesome.
<RobotPinkie> I think it'll probably hit over 1000
<Sir_Hoofalot> Faust is best alicorn
<Silverscreen> 11Ford looks so young in this movie
<NoOne> yay
<lunamoonie> dashiewithrainbows...that was the best typo ever

<Dumori> yeah

<Bjornfot> >mfw i'm in 4 chat rooms
<DSNesmith> the future is scary
<DoctorValor> Yesh/
<Apokalipse> then the lobby will be seriously needed...
<Ratlan> CMC won't until either end of S2 or sometime in S3, is my guess.
<Ninja> 0HOVER CARS
<PrincessSparklyCuddl> Faust is best fause
<djdexcat> Huh, future cars have old VHS graphics.
<Lumidaub> what's with the music?
<Dermathil> indeed he does, Silverscreen. But do you think we should talk about the product placement curse thingy?
<Nittany_Tiger> It's 2011. Why no flying cars?!?
<Xzite> haha
<House> BTW: No CG here
<mib_ylr2qu> ahes ago
<PrincessSparklyCuddl> fast*
<Dumori> and word of mouth
<Rated-RPonyStar> Floating cars, always needed in the future
<VendorPony> FLYING CARS. WE NEED THEM BY 2015
<Lasharus> Damnit, I SAID there was too much of that. My wrist hurts now.
<Puppy> wow so few in the rarity room 0.0

<SweetTea> someone tell me why we dont have those umbrellas right now??
<PrincessSparklyCuddl> faust* oh god why typos..
<DSNesmith> it's THE FUTURE
<Dumori> and the only live stream of s2 I think
<AdamTheChao> So flying cars come with smoke machines now?
<JojotheDinosaur> okies then
<Vergil> Silverscreen: This was before his "I WANT MY FAMILY BACK" phase.
<Bandages> Nittany_Tiger: There are
<Tek> 8 Years to go Tiger
<SirReginald> nom nom nom
<DeadlyPony> It's 2011, why no gieshas in my windows?
<Xzite> aww
<PinkamenaDianePie> Why do computers in the future have such bad resolution?
<BakedMacintosh> I better have a hover car by 2019!
<Ninja> 0i wonder if they have the internet
<nah> @nittany_tiger we have those already
<cbpony9001> this world runs off of windows 3
<Blinky> There's a flatscreen in one of the scenes
<a041744> Its 2011 and japan hasnt taken over the world?
<xGeniPoni> people dun liek rawity. D:
<Bandages> Just not mass produced
<eeverfreenights> MEANWHILE ON CORESCAUNT
<GabeMoist> We had 200 during pre-show
<nah> @nittany_tiger they're called PLANES
<Shadowx> ill have to send you my acc name after this
<mib_1skj2r> the future needs more ponies.
<Kdude> awesome floaty cars! CRT monitors......
<Silverscreen> 11Dermathil: Maybe. Maybe Not.
<Sir_Hoofalot> Not much choice, is there
<Blinky> All the others are CRTs for whatever reason
<SuperBrony64> Nittany_Tiger: Flying Cars are for 2019, not now
<Bjornfot> i think basil is streaming, too
<FlaschenJoe11> we can'T drive in 2 dimensions, how are we going to manage 3
<Spectrum> Wait...no...maybe not.
<Razyn> Actually, there's like four livestreams
<DoctorValor> Aye then
<Aponymous> I think we do have led umbrellas now.
<Rated-RPonyStar> Guess all thea "Green" stuff was a waste huh?
<GabeMoist> I can't remember having that many then
<Silverscreen> 11*trollface*
<MightyMatrix> The site isn't letting me in the Rainbow Dash Room
<Dumori> yeah
<mariomarc> what is the plot so far?
<Lasharus> An honest-to-god flatscreen? :P
<Sir_Hoofalot> trollestia/mollestia or offscreen luna
<Rookeealding> no triva?
<Tovler> Meanwhile should tell GLaDOS about his moustache.
<mib_ylr2qu> i wont lie, i expected much higher quality
<rainbowcrash> Wait what year is this supposed to be?
<RAWRity> I just think there's a lot of possible material for them finding their Marks. For instance, if one gets theirs before the others, and there's jealousy issues. or they get it, and have to work to stay friends in between pursuing their passions.
<Ninja> 0magic
<House> In the 80s future?
<Rainbow_derp> hope the Mods don't mind I did some advertising 4 the show. for you guys
<Nittany_Tiger> nah: You know what I mean. :p
<coopm0re> WHTEVER YOU DO HAN! DONT PUT POINTS INTO SWIMMING!
<chedduhr> I love how this chat makes livestreams the only place where you can talk during a movie and everyone can still enjoy it :D
<MrPoniator_> They sure had to push their imaginations in those days
<Fluttershy`> oh u Silverscreen
<GoldenArbiter> Flying cars: bringing drunk driving to a whole new level.
<Elky> I prefer the snatcher aesthetic...
<VendorPony> NO, It'S FOR 2015
<StarPlatinum> 0Get off my plane!
<story-dreamer> hoping to come back later for g1 movie. had to see what this was.
<MuNova> It wouldn't let me in any room. >_>

<House> It's all BBS
<PrincessCelestia> don't worry you can your own fluttershy in the near future!
<Applebloom> Corescant
<DeadlyPony> Getting flashbacks to Dues Ex revolutions
<House> OH THE HORROR
<Bjornfot> and the facebook bronies group
<Blinky> It's hidden in the background, though
<MrMaxaminus> It's always night-time in this film
<DashWithRainbows> no internet as i can see
<Bandages> How long is the movie?
<SilkAMV> Rarity makes people feel inadequate
<Dermathil> I still remember that discussion we had way back then, Silverscreen. When was that? June? Oh right, the day after Kick Ass.
<chedduhr> very round and furry
<Meanwhile> I would Tovler but GLaDOS is absent.
<VendorPony> WHY U NO WATCH BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II
<Destroyer> @S_E_F have you seen Canada? That's what awaits USA
<DashWithRainbows> also no ponies in future
<a041744> Theres no sunlight in the future.
<PrincessSparklyCuddl> Lol yeah
<Kevini> apparently I have to watch at 10 AM
<BakedMacintosh> could be 80s BBSes
<LGNR> Or how about someone just telling them about their obvious talents?
<Ninja> 0this future sucks
<DeadlyPony> Does anybody Died in this movie?
<Shadowx> bronystate chat is like /b/ lol sooo fast
<Dumori> I've not had a good look seeign as I was gonna be at this one

<Lasharus> Entire world evolved. Except police stations.
<SilkAMV> Come with being the best
<Lasharus> Figures.
<eeverfreenights> we never asked for this deadlypony
<Arrakiz> in the grim future of 2019 there is only night
<LGNR> The CMC saga would end in an instant.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well remember
<Ebon_Dusk> Skin jobs, lol
<AdamTheChao> Would that make it space Noir?
<DSNesmith> Skinjob
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, I know, Dermathil.
<NoOne> can i post link to where they sell those umbrellas?
<Xzite> maybe its a *shades* dark future.
<Navy_Brony> Sup?
<FlaschenJoe11> two hovercars collided 150 metres in the air. no survivors
<djdexcat> 'Skinjobs' sounds dirty
<SilverVision> Four Skin Jobs
<ValtheJean> 2,14 cutie marks aren't always about talents

<chedduhr> ur mom happened :P
<RAWRity> and it's clear that the writers for he show are intelligent and careful with the characters, so there's a good chance they could handle it very well.
<FlaschenJoe11> how?
<Tehpogo> The thing in the recording happened.
<Ratlan> True, but the idea of one getting her mark would be interesting
<DoctorValor> Chatbox next to the screen would be nice.
<Amino> That's why AJ channel is so awesome. Nice and quiet
<nah> you can't change your name
<Coster156> 0:P
<desertman2> yes
<Ninja> 0Either way they die at the end
<mib_ylr2qu> yea that didnt work
<Shadowx> saw the constant pony thread which sparked my initial intrest
<MuNova> Well, I dunno whether to go do stuff and stuff waiting for the ponies, or what... lol
<Braeburn|TF2> sooo many mibbits!
<Caboozles> I have a deep loathing for that place...
<NoOne> would it be advertising if i were to post a link to where one would be able to buy one of those LED umbrellas?
<House> Fly cars underground?
<DashWithRainbows> magic of course
<Grundle> Nice

<AllisZero> Feels proud to be an open brony
<mariomarc> oh conveniant
<Tehpogo> I accidentaly a turtle.
<Randall1160> O RLY?
<Lasharus> Very true. It's always interesting to see how the future was seen, and how it compares to how we see it now.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 we'll just have to see when the time comes :P
<Fluttershy`> is the /nick not working?
<trebthegamer> how nice
<Ratlan> And/or perhaps getting a younger pony involved in the CMC...
<General_Hazard> oh yeah, there are origami and eye motifs if you guys wanna keep an EYE out for them
<Happy-Kah> high five!
<DoctorValor> ^
<Rainbow-Dash> So is this acting as some sort of a refuge from the lagg?
<Ziltoid> The replicunts
<Othrys> Sweet
<Lasharus> Especially in older games.
<MuNova> And you gotta set your name when you join the chat, that's all I know

<Blinky> Cyberpunk is always cool
<Braeburn> the /nick command is working fine
<Lasharus> "New York. 1999."
