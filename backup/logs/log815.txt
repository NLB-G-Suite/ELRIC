<Pale_Horse> Windigoes are a native american spirit creature that represented the drastic and terrible parts of Winter. They would often choose a single victim to torment, and stalk him for days or weeks on end. The victim would hear the howls of the creature or see it lurking just out of the corner of their eyes, but only they could detect it.
