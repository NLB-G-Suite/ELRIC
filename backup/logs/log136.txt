<Dumori> and I should
<SuperBrony64> Surprised that machine didn't rip off Scootaloo's tail
<DashWithRainbows> same here
<Ziltoid> dat flank
<DashWithRainbows> all kill them all...
<Veewave> Butt of coarse.
*Dumori hopes the CmC help save the day in part 2
<DashWithRainbows> i hope luna does
<Ziltoid> lolno
*ThePretender agrees.
<Nittany_Tiger> I want to see Luna in part 2.
<mooponi> isnt there no luna until later in the season
<Ziltoid> I want celestia and luna to save the day
<SuperBrony64> Ponyville must be a nice place to live...
<DashWithRainbows> mfw i read mooponi sentence
<SuperBrony64> They have snow there during the winter :(
<Nittany_Tiger> They set up a cold front every Winter Wrap-Up.
<mooponi> i know faust confirmed more luna in season 2, so we will see her eventually =]
<Diftraku> fun fact, only the video lags for me
<Nittany_Tiger> Potentially unknowingly.
<Sol> Yeah, she was
<Nittany_Tiger> It lags for me as well.
<mib_1kue65> not just for you
<Sol> In stained-glass form :PPPPPPPPPPPPP
<Diftraku> Oh good
<Diftraku> I was getting paranoid here xD
<DashWithRainbows> im lagging ...
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm getting under a frame per second.
<DashWithRainbows> that is terrible!
<prince-dari> GGgala: You here?
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, 1.5 FPS.
<Dumori> 10 fps here
<Sol> P sure he is
<ThePretender> What is a stable connection? Nothing but miserable piles of packets!
<prince-dari> If he's here, then why no response? :P
<Sol> Iderno :/
<Tovler> wow, free Portal game is amazing. It should be more popular.
<Sol> Someone's changing the vids
<Edward_Newgate> playlist
<Tovler> I'd whine about my video getting skipped, but with this MONDO lag, I don't give a damn
<Sol> I think he's clopping
<Sol> It explains everything
<prince-dari> I could fix the lag.
<prince-dari> But GGgala isn't responding.
<prince-dari> <_<
<prince-dari> >_>
<DashWithRainbows> everytime you clop, Celestia kills a pony....
<Wrek> 05like she wasnt alreayd
*ThePretender is preparing to punch the lag directly. This should solve things.
<Polarfire> XD
<Tovler> damn, I haven't clopped in like 4 days
*Edward_Newgate already tried, didn't work
<Sol> I've never clopped
<Wrek> 05lies
<Sol> OHAI
<DashWithRainbows> ive stopped clopping since midnight,
<GGgala> sorry, i was afk a little
<Nittany_Tiger> I have never masturbated in my entire 28 years on this planet.
<SuperBrony64> Uh oh
<GGgala> what happen
<Edward_Newgate> said the spider to the mouse
<DashWithRainbows> even then i done 1 month without
<SuperBrony64> Yeah…let's not talk about that...
<DashWithRainbows> trying to kick the habit as it is just boring now
<Tovler> you don't need to clop? I'm jelly
<Wrek> 05no not again
<Wrek> 05argh
<Diftraku> those shops are dangerous
<Sol> This is a different one at least
<mib_1kue65> What's this?
<DashWithRainbows> mute and now to pokemon battle themes we go"
<DashWithRainbows> an acid trip
<Tovler> oh snap, I'm missing my video
<Sol> But essentially the same
<Dumori> I like this side show we got going
<Edward_Newgate> Solar beam
<Diftraku> it's like watching powerpoint of a video, with sounds
<Nittany_Tiger> I wonder how this movie plays with APC.
<Dumori> some of the time with soud
<Dumori> even thats funky here
<Dumori> weirdly that makles for an intresting comic
<ThePretender> dawwwwwww
<prince-dari> GGgala
<Dumori> noidea whats going on
<Dumori> though
<prince-dari> Go look at Skype.
<Edward_Newgate> mlp my little panda
<SuperBrony64> lol awesome!
<Diftraku> lol
<Wrek> 05leo n satan leo n satan
<Wrek> 05leo n satan
<Polarfire> what the hell
<DashWithRainbows> :D
<DashWithRainbows> i love satam
<DashWithRainbows> satan*
<Sol> Dos variables
<DashWithRainbows> 1+4 = suck my balls
<Nittany_Tiger> sqrt(90) = 3*sqrt(10)
<Edward_Newgate> mfw I first got into algebra
<Polarfire> wut
<Polarfire> XD
<Sol> mfw that works
<Sol> POL!
<Diftraku> lol
<ThePretender> SHENANIGANS
<Polarfire> That was... interesting.
<GGgala> okay, hold on. trying to fix the lag and stuff
<MutantPanda521> hi
<Polarfire> Sol!
<Nittany_Tiger> Solving an equation with 2 variables without defined variables.
<DashWithRainbows> awesome series go!
<ThePretender> Sol Badguy?
<MutantPanda521> ...
<DashWithRainbows> anyone seen the pony version of awesome reach??
<SuperBrony64> 2 Variables = Need 2 Equations!
<DashWithRainbows> its call MLP friendship is awesome i think
<Tovler> damn, I ran out of anime videos of girls getting sucked into magic pandas
<Veewave> I lost stream.
<Sol> Two variables are hard at first, but they're easy after some practive
<Wrek> 05if read read a little
<Diftraku> oh lovely, dawatch messages have doubled since I last checked
<ThePretender> EMP! OUR STREAM IS DOWN!
<Wrek> 05you will notice ggala said he was gona fix the lag
<Nittany_Tiger> Wish we could play The Mentally Abridged series.
<Dumori> my maths is rusty
<Sol> Yeah, GG is working on the lag
<Wrek> 05so remain calm
<Wrek> 05I SAID REMAIN CALM
<Dumori> sdkf;jhehuoivgfhouiafeds hoiujnsDAFPKOJINHLKJNAERG LKJB FSGDILHUSGHFND
*DashWithRainbows remains calm
<Sol> HEY GAIS
<Veewave> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Wrek> 05CALM DAMIT CAAAAAAAALM
*Dumori panicks maddly
<Sol> WHO WANTS TO LEARN LIMITS?!!??!?!
*Diftraku sets mode +panic on Diftraku
<Tovler> Calm people, calm ~Avatar
<FreezeFrame> Limits are easy
*Nittany_Tiger aced all calculus classes.
<ThePretender> Serenity now!
<Squeejee> Hey guys, let's sing a song!
<FreezeFrame> Let epsilon > 0
<Diftraku> Calculus, I hate calculus...
<Diftraku> With a passion
<Dumori> intergration is FUN
<Diftraku> Derivate my arse!
<Diftraku> :P
<Wrek> 05Lim h -> 0
<Nittany_Tiger> Limits are fine. The mathematical definition of a limit gets crazy.
<Edward_Newgate> Studying for calculas makes me want to derive myself off a cliff
<Diftraku> ^
<Dumori> even more fun with imaginary numbers
*ThePretender has mentally checked out now that we're talking about math.
<Sol> THE LIMIT AS DELTA X APPROACHES ZERO EQUALS IS THE FUNCTION OF X PLUS DELTA X MINUS THE FUNCTION OF X ALL OVER DELTA X
<Edward_Newgate> I'm so punny
<Sol> RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRRR
<FreezeFrame> For all such epsilon, there exists an n-naught element of the naturals such that for all n >= n-naught, |x-n - L| < epsilon
<MutantPanda521> hi
<Dumori> i makes mathematics EPIC
*FreezeFrame is in Real Analysis >.>
<DashWithRainbows> mfw we are now talking about maths....
<Diftraku> I'm supposed to be an electrical engineer when I get out of school... I fail at the simple math we're doing right now
<Nittany_Tiger> Integrals are fun.
<ThePretender> PARADIGM SHIFT
<Veewave> lol
<Diftraku> Yeaaaah, not going to happen xD
<Nittany_Tiger> The Reinmann Sum. :p
<FreezeFrame> :P
<ThePretender> THIS TOPIC IS ABOUT DIAMONDS
<Wrek> 05it had to be done freeze, :3
<Sol> SIN IS USED TO MEASURE THE Y VALUE OF THE UNIT CIRCLE
<FreezeFrame> Yes, it did.
<FreezeFrame> As does this
<Sol> COSINE IS USED FOR THE X VALUES
*Edward_Newgate is wondering if Wrek meant to say mudder, or misspelled muddle
<Nittany_Tiger> y = rsin(theta)
<Diftraku> http://i.imgur.com/6Muza.jpg
<Sol> TANGENT IS SIN DIVIDED BY COSINE
<Wrek> 05its late, i am entitled to typos
<Dumori> ooh ooh
<Dumori> Hyberbolic Trig every pony
<Diftraku> Wrek, I'm 1 hour ahead of you...
<Edward_Newgate> so it was a typo...
<Big_Macintosh> Ew, Hyperbolic "trig"
<Big_Macintosh> Actually, I don't mind 'em
<Diftraku> Those words are like hebrew to me
<Big_Macintosh> they're just handy exponentials, eeyup
<Diftraku> I have no idea...
<Nittany_Tiger> I had to work with hyperbolas for my thesis, and I didn't realize that sinh and cosh define the single branch of a hyperbola.
<Sol> USE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION TO MULTIPLY OUT LARGE EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
<ThePretender> ;_;
<Sol> YOU USE THE PASCAL TRIANGLE TO CARRY OUT BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION
<ThePretender> MAKE it SOP
<Tovler> Strange Wilderness puzzles me. I kinda like it, but it's got a 00% on Rotten Tomatoes
<prince-dari> Refresh the page http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
<prince-dari> Stream's back up.
<GGgala> okay, trying a new veemi embed...
<GGgala> yeah, what he said
<Dumori> Bah the equastion is more fun for binomials
<Big_Macintosh> sinh x = (e^x - e^-x)/2, cosh x = (e^x + e^-x)/2
<Diftraku> GGala, tried using livestream?
<prince-dari> Eugh no.
<prince-dari> Not livestream.
<Dumori> the backup is back up
<ThePretender> relink?
<ThePretender> haaaaaaaaaaa
<ThePretender> ty
<Sol> No, livestreem has viewer limits
<Nittany_Tiger> x = cosh(t) and y = sinh(t) defines a single branch of a hyperbola.
<Diftraku> You can apply to have them lifted
<Sol> And viewer limits are ewww >:
<prince-dari> You can remove viewer limits, but livestream is still "Eugh no"
<Diftraku> Initially it's 50
<Dumori> hasn't done math for a year
<prince-dari> Livestream is shit.
<Sol> NOW LET'S TALK GRAMMAR KIDS
<Dumori> and acording to my exam papaers I can't do it
<Wrek> 05when it comes to streamign copyrighted material atleast
<Nittany_Tiger> This morning, I tried to view alternate streams for S2E1 when this one was failing, but most channels were full.
<FreezeFrame> hyperbolic "trig" functions are called so because they differentiate and integrate similarly to true trig functions
<prince-dari> Wrek: So for us it's useless.
<prince-dari> :P
<Wrek> 05precisley
<Diftraku> :P
<Nittany_Tiger> I did get one with crappy sound, but no lag.
<SuperBrony64> *squee*
<Diftraku> oddly enough the veemi stream worked best
<Dumori> I got one with no lag and good sound
<Sol> Yep
<Dumori> but I jumped ship early
<Wrek> 05im just happt with my 1080p copy of S2 ep1
<Wrek> 05happy*
<Nittany_Tiger> sin x = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/2 cos x = ((e^ix) + (e^-ix))/2
<Sol> I had one thousand backups going
<Dumori> DL link for it or you record
<Diftraku> Still no torrent on archive
<Sol> Man, Nit
<Sol> Somepony knows their Trig
<Wrek> 05ripped the youtube vid
<FreezeFrame> Yeah, exponentials are everywhere
<ThePretender> mon visand quand le mathematique
<Veewave> Bo stream for me.
<Veewave> No*
<Diftraku> Yay
<Nittany_Tiger> Yep.
<Hat> that was a fun day yesterday
<Sol> Lol lag
<Dumori> Trig is quite beautiful IMHO
<Nittany_Tiger> I might be off with those definition by a bit, though.
<Tovler> yay, no more lag
<Sol> O
<Dumori> possabley
<Dumori> I can cheak
<FreezeFrame> In continuous probabilities 1/e pops up surprisingly often, too.
<Tovler> j/k
<Sol> That was my computer
<Sol> No lag is good lag
<Dumori> I have my data book some place near
<Sol> e is best number
<Sol> i is also good
<Tovler> actually, it's lagging a bunch less now
<FreezeFrame> pi is a bad number
<Sol> ei is even better though
<Diftraku> it works bettar
*Dumori looks at his sea of desk detritus. This might take a while!
<DashWithRainbows> less lag just in time for pinkie
<GGgala> okay, so stream works great?
<GGgala> you're all at www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/ ?
<ThePretender> this is catchy
<Diftraku> more or less
<FreezeFrame> It's the ratio of circumference to diameter, but you will never use diameter anywhere else.
<Dumori> -1 is best number
<Sol> yeah, it does
<Edward_Newgate> If pi is bad, why does it have its own day?
<ThePretender> yessir
<Diftraku> *knocks table*
<Nittany_Tiger> I know this one mostly by heart: e^(ix) = cos(x) - i*sin(x)
<Diftraku> 0 is best number!
<Sol> sqrt(-1) is best
<Diftraku> :P
<FreezeFrame> Edward_Newgate: Because Aristotle loved it.
<FreezeFrame> It's a horribly defined number
<Edward_Newgate> Can't explain that
<FreezeFrame> tau = 2*pi is better.
<Sol> Aristotle is the daddy of Psychology too
<Diftraku> 0¹
<Sol> Aristotle was a beast
<FreezeFrame> Since it's ratio of circumference to radius, which is something that's used much, much, much, much more often.
<Dumori> e^i*pi
<Dumori> is also best number
<ThePretender> the name of this video?
<ThePretender> *is?
<Dumori> e i and pi are my fav numbers for no reason
<Sol> Night of Pony
<Tovler> brb
<Edward_Newgate> Bet its filled with Discord
<ThePretender> thanks, Sol
<Sol> Again?

<SuperBrony64> FreezeFrame:…no…it can't be true...*sniff*
<prince-dari> Ohhh
<prince-dari> Now I finally understand the Magneto thing.
<prince-dari> XD
<Diftraku> lol
<FreezeFrame> I know exactly who you're referring to.
<Diftraku> For the uninformed
<Wrek> 05care to explain it then dari?
<Diftraku> They had a bloody magneto ad on a mareathon
<Tovler> Even the gang members sound like black people from the early 80s
<FreezeFrame> Yup
<Tovler> nopony says sucka anymore
<ThePretender> and then Hasbro took note
<Sol> YES
<Sol> THIS SONG
<FreezeFrame> Tovler: White guys say "sucka" a lot.
<ThePretender> I KNOW THIS
<Sol> One of the few good 90s songs
<ThePretender> but from where?
<FreezeFrame> Digimon: the Movie
<Tovler> They shonuff don't

<Dumori> is angry is CD didn't have the lazy town cover
<Dumori> to the torrent
<Diftraku> dari, lol
<Veewave> I'm sorry, my tone was outrageous.
<FreezeFrame> Forgot how good the Fluttershy scene was in this one.
<Tovler> Back in the day, even I had to admit that the Digimon anime was better.
<ThePretender> Woohoo, I picked this one!
<Sol> Which animu is this?
<FreezeFrame> Luna as Zappa
<mib_hld88k> S2E1 been on yet/being repeated soon?
<ThePretender> it's based of the opening to Guilty Gear XX, a fighting game
<FreezeFrame> What ThePretender said
<Sol> Ahh, I see
<SuperBrony64> mib_hld88k: See YouTube
<ThePretender> whose main charcter is named Sol Badguy
<Diftraku> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrBVNkDl_EQ

<SuperBrony64> LordCelestia: So what's the problem? Is it going to destroy the planet?
<Tovler> How do you discover a satellite?
<Nittany_Tiger> NASA still exists.
*DashWithRainbows is calling bullshit
<Sol> A natural satelite or a manmade satelite?
<Nittany_Tiger> It's just not doing much anymore.

<Sol> This song is best song ever
<Dumori> Ok for 24 hours all Ive eaten is caffine
<Dumori> now I dont feel well
<Sol> Eaten?
<DashWithRainbows> :l eaten...
<Dumori> yeas
<ThePretender> onos
<DashOrCrash> In the past 24 hours, I've had pizza, toast, and lots of coffee.
<DashWithRainbows> you ate coffee beans?
<DashOrCrash> a day well spent =D
<ThePretender> make some tea then hit the hay Dumori
<Sol> XD
<Dumori> nah I mean drunk
<SuperBrony64> I ate a grilled cheese sandwich…that's a bout it
<Sol> Drank
<Dumori> I've just got up ThePretender
<Dumori> about 3 hours ago
<SuperBrony64> I still very much want Pizza :/
<DashWithRainbows> went to party, it was shit. but with possibiblity of turning cousin inot brony
<DashOrCrash> I have plenty of leftover pizza
<SuperBrony64> With rubies!
<Dumori> I hit the hay after the encor of e1
*LordCelestia The satellite is barelling towards us at 5 miles per second. Yep. 5 miles per god damn second. That's pretty fast.
<DashWithRainbows> will follow through
<DashOrCrash> but YOU CAN'T HAVE IT
<ThePretender> no sound?
<SuperBrony64> Wait..what am I talking about?
<DashOrCrash> my pizza.
*LordCelestia that is all.
<Dumori> still I need some solid food
<Tovler> 2 whole pizzas so far. I'll have to fast Sunday so my eating habits go back to normal.
<DashOrCrash> OMFGWTFBBQ PORTAL!!!
<Sol> For the 24th, at that speed it must be pretty far out there
<ThePretender> ah
<SuperBrony64> Yay!
<SuperBrony64> My video!
<LordCelestia> It is
<SuperBrony64> :P
<DashOrCrash> You made this?
<SuperBrony64> No..but it was my request!
<Sol> THe size of that crater.....
<DashOrCrash> ...ah
<SuperBrony64> So you could essentially say that :D
<Dumori> 5 miles per second is n;t to fast for somthigning in orbit and falling
<Sol> That velocity
<Sol> It'll get faster
<LordCelestia> It weighs in at 6.5 tons
<Dumori> then slow
<Dumori> aLOT
<SuperBrony64> Dumori: Enough to cause a paper cut
<Dumori> when it enters atmo
<DashWithRainbows> i think it will most likely hit the ocean
<DashWithRainbows> if not then some wehre not near city
<ThePretender> oh this
<Sol> MAYBE
<ThePretender> YES
<Tovler> 70% chance it will
<Sol> IT'S CLARK KENT
<DashWithRainbows> omg yes
<SuperBrony64> :D
<Diftraku> lol
<Veewave> Again?
<Dumori> 1 in 3200 that nay part of it will it one person

<ThePretender> wow
<ThePretender> it's 10:42 here
<DashWithRainbows> might go off in about an hour or maybe just stay on
<DashWithRainbows> until stream ends
<prince-dari> What is this video...?
<DashWithRainbows> i dont know
<FreezeFrame> dari: You guys never set +N
<prince-dari> There's no +N on this IRCd.
<DashOrCrash> dafuq?
<DashWithRainbows> im listening to Gen 3 pokemon champion theme
<FreezeFrame> Ah
<Sol> AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
<ThePretender> season two opening
<Diftraku> oh yeah
<SuperBrony64> Haha
<DashWithRainbows> My little Marine Corps: War is Magic
<Tovler> GEN 3 HAS THE BEST VICTORY ROAD
<Diftraku> This will be in ep 3
<DashOrCrash> ...That was painful
<FreezeFrame> Is that the theme song as done by BRIAN BLESSED?
<DashOrCrash> and yes, Gen 3 is the best
<ThePretender> the french version of this song is GDLK
<Tovler> BEST POKEMON MUSIC IN GENERAL ALTHOUGH B/W COMES VERY CLOSE
<DashWithRainbows> Hoenn region is best Region
*Tovler hushes
<SuperBrony64> Careful headphone users..
<Diftraku> pokemon has music?
<DashWithRainbows> Team plasma has best theme
<DashOrCrash> The next games released will be remakes of ruby/saphire, I think
<DashWithRainbows> out of all bad guys
*Diftraku is very thankful of the warning
<ThePretender> my earssssssssssss
<FreezeFrame> Team Plasma has best villain theme
<DashWithRainbows> i hope so!
<DashWithRainbows> i think i cant go to bed now
<Diftraku> lol
<DashOrCrash> Ruby was the first video game I ever owned
<Tovler> Hoenn's underwater/diving music is amazing
<prince-dari> Ruby? That late?
<Diftraku> oh yes
<ThePretender> chickenQuest!
<Sol> Chickenquest?
<Diftraku> this vid
<DashWithRainbows> i owned all, Emerald is my favourite
<Diftraku> Approved
<ThePretender> Silver version is best version
<DashOrCrash> I never reset my Emerald, and now I have 500+ hours of playtime on it
<Sol> inb4 SCOOT
<Diftraku> Crystal tbh, for GBA
<prince-dari> Blue is my favourite.
<Tovler> B/W is my favorite because of Iris
<ThePretender> which is why I had Soul SIlver for a year and no chance to play it bcause no DS
<DashOrCrash> My least favorite is Firered
<Diftraku> dari, I still have blue around
<DashWithRainbows> but B/W has good grunt theme music and thats all....
<prince-dari> Same, but my battery in blue died.
<Diftraku> my GB is shite...
<FreezeFrame> B/W has awesome music in general
<Diftraku> *Sniff* it doesn't boot it
<Tovler> B/W had an actual ending
<FreezeFrame> Now two chickens!
<ThePretender> my battery in Red, Yellow and og Silver died ;_;
<DashOrCrash> My battery in Ruby died, but it still works
<ThePretender> same for my Sapphire
<ThePretender> 300+ hours, woo
<Sol> SCOOT
*DashWithRainbows prefers pokemon emerald no matter what
<ThePretender> don't you mean BAWK, Sol?
<DashOrCrash> Fav starter from each region?
<prince-dari> Yeah, but with the old games at any rate, your save dies if the battery goes.
<Tovler> Diamond Pearl was... ok I guess
*Diftraku plays pokemon as .rom from an SD card
<Diftraku> Yarrrr
<Sol> Bawk doesn't sound like TOOT though?
<GGgala> ROMs ftw
<DashOrCrash> I prefer charmander, chicorita, treeko, and Turtwig
<DashWithRainbows> Charmander, Totodile, Treecko (i dont know why), piplup, Snivy
<GGgala> no dead battery there!
<FreezeFrame> Bulbasaur, Cyndaquil, Torchic, Turtwig, Snivy
<DashOrCrash> Oh, and snivy as well
<DashWithRainbows> snivy because i heard was worst starter and i wanted a challenge
<DashOrCrash> Chacarron!
<Diftraku> lol
<DashOrCrash> Derpy knows the lyrics to this song
<FreezeFrame> >mfw the philly steak I just got doesn't have any seasoning on the meat
<DashOrCrash> nobody else does.
<FreezeFrame> >mfw that doesn't overly matter, as I put sriracha sauce on it.
*Tovler craves macarons
<ThePretender> ...true, but BAWK BAWK BAWK is more fitting, seeing as it's Scootloo
<FreezeFrame> Actually, I don't use my starter in Black
<FreezeFrame> My fire type is Mothra, my Grass type is Sawsbuck, and my water type is Seismitoad
<DashWithRainbows> starter was level 80 by the time i got to the elite 4
<Tovler> The starters in Black were horrendous
<SuperBrony64> First time I'm listening to this song in full..
<DashWithRainbows> owned them all...
<ctrlx> huh... i don't remember my nickserv password
<Rainbow-Dash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=599xiSGk2NM
<DashWithRainbows> had some level 40s just incase
<ctrlx> that's od
<ctrlx> d
<DashOrCrash> Snivy was the only good starter in B/W
<Rainbow-Dash> Be warned, you should turn your volume down
<ThePretender> all water starters, all the time
<Fluttershy`> saafeeetty daanncee
<Tovler> Ninetails officially became better than Arcanine in B/W, That's why Emerald is inferior
<DashOrCrash> EMERALD IS SUPERIOR
<DashOrCrash> to everything
<Tovler> Infinite TMs, Cloyster can now learn Hydro Pump after 15 years.
<ThePretender> haha, yeeees
<FreezeFrame> Hydro Pump sucks
<DashOrCrash> I wish they still had the Battle Frontier from Emerald...
<DashOrCrash> Best one ever
<FreezeFrame> I have a Galvantula that spams Thunder
<FreezeFrame> >yfw Thunder gets to 91% accuracy
<Tovler> Team Magma/Aqua were the dumbest teams ever.
<Rainbow-Dash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyQlryTt-0&feature=related
<DashWithRainbows> strongest pokemon + my favourite is Latios, has very high speed IMO
<DashOrCrash> I once had a Lv100 Blaziken that spammed Overheat
<ThePretender> 91% for Thunder? WHAT MAGIC IS THIS
<DashOrCrash> lol, I love Latios
<Tovler> I didn't know flooding the world would be bad!
<FreezeFrame> Galvantula has Compound Eyes
<FreezeFrame> Which boosts the accuracy of all its moves by 30% of their base
<Tovler> Finally, a playable Spider Pokemon
<DashWithRainbows> mother of god....
<ThePretender> wow
<FreezeFrame> It's Elec/Bug, too.
<DashOrCrash> My vid!
*Rainbow-Dash snickers
<Rainbow-Dash> Evil video is evil
<Sol> Huh, that was weird
<DashOrCrash> I know, I just felt like it
<FreezeFrame> Elec/Bug is a good typing combo, too.
<Tovler> Pokespider knows Energy fall to mess with Ground Type (hidden power is better, but still)
<SuperBrony64> If we're doing this video in the order presented in request channel, next video is HEADPHONE WARNING
<ThePretender> Elec Bug reminds me of Battle Network 3
<DashWithRainbows> what i hate is electric types with levitate....
<FreezeFrame> Energy Ball
<DashWithRainbows> NO WEAKNESS SRSLY?!?!?
<FreezeFrame> There is one now
<FreezeFrame> There was already Ghost/Dark that had no weakness
<Tovler> Wash Rotom is broken as hell.
<DashWithRainbows> Spiritomb?
<FreezeFrame> Yup
<DashOrCrash> what about rock attacks?
<FreezeFrame> Nope
<DashOrCrash> don't those supereffect?
<Fluttershy`> prince-dari: hi... =-=
<DashWithRainbows> Wash rotom is really OP
<Tovler> It's only weak against Grass and Super effect against everything.
<FreezeFrame> Rock is super effective against Ice and Flying, that's it.
<DashOrCrash> dang
<Tovler> and Fire
<FreezeFrame> Right
<FreezeFrame> I knew I was forgetting something.
<Veewave> stream and chat, not related.
<SuperBrony64> Oh wait, guess not.
<SuperBrony64> Nvm, one of them is a headphone warning though...
<Tovler> Porygon2 Became the shit again in B/W
<Tovler> uh-oh speaking of shit, brb

<prince-dari> MFW my dad bought crumpets.
<prince-dari> I could have tea and crumpets. Lawl.
<prince-dari> >never done that before
<DashWithRainbows> brit stereotype?
<FreezeFrame> Yes
<mooponi> people dont draw ponies with alternate hairstyles enough
<DashWithRainbows> i dont drink tea much and i dont eat crumpets
<Fluttershy`> prince-dari: hi dari... :<
<FreezeFrame> I freaking love crumpets
<prince-dari> Ohai
<DashWithRainbows> i used to eat them but then i forgot about them
<ThePretender> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B_FV5DCfrs&list=FLMh0z3-Z8PdevhwTOHMgd0A&index=11

<Natleyn> I remember seeing it on TV before they stopped showing it
<DashWithRainbows> my mum just came into my room and shes drunk....
<DashWithRainbows> asking for a hug,..
<Sol> I liked Secret Butt Fun when it was more Secret
<ThePretender> brb, gotta restart my computer

<DashWithRainbows> fucking shit as it was more of a 7 year old party
<TrollightSparkle> Um.. what video? No streams for me on either LQ or HQ.. I guess the internet just hates me, you know ;_;
<Natleyn> No, they were just reciting in-jokes and talking badly about others.
<ThePretender> that's better, I can hear
<Revolver> XD
<Natleyn> trollight: http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/

*AllisZero hugs Natleyn back
<AllisZero> Thanks all :D
<Inspector_Celestine> vote for him in the tester!
<GGgala> me making an account and saying i'm 14 isn't any more legit than asking me if i'm 14 with a simple form X_X
<cbpony9001> I got a family to feed! ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
<TrollightSparkle> COFFEE FOR EVERYONE'
<DashWithRainbows> inb4 coffee!

<SuperBrony64> *troll face*
<DashWithRainbows> was not really paying attention
<TrollightSparkle> Oh SuperBrony64, you so trolly
<Nittany_Tiger> There were only two correct numbers on that board.
<GGgala> the game maker is such a troll
<ThePretender> 3

<TrollightSparkle> WELCOME TO HALO REACH
<TrollightSparkle> inb4 gayness.
<DashWithRainbows> this was me when i got halo reach but without gayness
<Natleyn> Oh god.
<Sol> XDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<TrollightSparkle> Natleyn.. Yeah x_x
<ThePretender> the irony is that Halo: Reach wasn't that actiony
<GGgala> >but without gayness
<Nittany_Tiger> I still haven't bought Reach.
<ThePretender> it was really somber
<GGgala> paradox detected
<TrollightSparkle> YO BBOY THAT JUST AINT THE WORD
<Natleyn> That boy just ain't right.
*Nittany_Tiger wishes Microsoft wouldn't charge for online play.
<TrollightSparkle> Nice time for buffering right?
*ThePretender agrees
*TrollightSparkle feels Nittany_Tiger's pain.
<Natleyn> Shit, that was fast.
<ThePretender> 360 users unite!
<TrollightSparkle> Oh, I'm not a 360 user.. I just borrowed my friend's 360 and bought XBL for 3 months. Still liked it though :)
<Nittany_Tiger> There are too many Xbox fanboys that justify the fee.
<prince-dari> Dat incognito
<DashWithRainbows> im a 360 user....
<Sol> Welp, we're at the end it seems
<Nittany_Tiger> I haven't touched my 360 in a long time.
<Natleyn> Whoo!
<DashWithRainbows> finaly something pony related!
<TrollightSparkle> PC/PS3 here.
<Nittany_Tiger> I play on all platforms except Wii.
<ThePretender> this is so well done
<Natleyn> Do we know next weeks movies yet? o-o
<prince-dari> I've got a PS3, haven't used it for a while though.
<Tovler> Wii is a platform?
<ThePretender> yes >>
<TrollightSparkle> Lawl Tovler
<Sol> I have a PS3 I haven't used since about August
<TrollightSparkle> Yes.. I used to play CoD4 on it all the time.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm slowly leaving the PC due to publisher bullshit (DRM).
<DashWithRainbows> Wii is dead...
<TrollightSparkle> Friend codes were bullshit IMO
<Tovler> I've been using mine as a leg warmer.
<DashWithRainbows> yes they were
<DashWithRainbows> only good thing about nintendo was ds because of pokemon
<ThePretender> ahahah, my favorites!
<TrollightSparkle> "Oh look! Connect with your friends with this 16 character code that you won't remember!"
<Nittany_Tiger> I really don't like gaming anymore. It's being monotinized to hell.
<ThePretender> hooray for autoplay, now you all see what I listen to XD
<Tovler> I wish I could be a PC gamer.
<DashWithRainbows> i only play to annoy little kids on CoD trying to quickscope
<Sol> Welp, I'm out
<TrollightSparkle> Aww, bye Sol!
<Nittany_Tiger> And horrid copy protection on PC games.
<ThePretender> dat Soul Calibur suite
<ThePretender> awwwww
<DashWithRainbows> just use the most annoying stuff
<ThePretender> yeah
<ThePretender> bye, Sol!
<Sol> See you guys on Friday!
<prince-dari> MFW I liked MW2 because of quickscoping.
<Nittany_Tiger> And greedy publishers like Activision.
<prince-dari> It was the most you could have on that game. :|
<TrollightSparkle> I liked MW2 because I got to troll people with Marathon, Lightweight, Commando, and Tac Knife :P
<DashWithRainbows> mfw i like MW2 because of riot shielding
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't like MW2's MP. It's a mess.
<Natleyn> Sleep well Sol!
<DashWithRainbows> i still do with those TrollightSparkle
<Revolver> I like trains
<TrollightSparkle> Nittany_Tiger, I know.. one moment you hear "Harriers incoming", next thing you know "TACTICAL NUKE INCOMING".
<prince-dari> MW2 zombie lobbies were pretty cool too.
<Nittany_Tiger> Killstreaks ruin the balance.
<DashWithRainbows> yep
<DashWithRainbows> BFBC2 is better than CoD IMO
<TrollightSparkle> By the way, what song is this?
<ThePretender> it's a Soul Calibur inpsired suite
<DashWithRainbows> anyways im off now as it is now 5:06am
<DashWithRainbows> and i need some sleep
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't like BC2.
<TrollightSparkle> Bye Dash!
*Natleyn hugs DashWithRainbows g'night
<Natleyn> Sleep well :3
<ThePretender> I wish I knew what songs made up this suite
<DashWithRainbows> thanks guys!
<DashWithRainbows> bye!
<ThePretender> later DashWithRainbows!
<Nittany_Tiger> High difficulty curve. Insulting server messages.
<TrollightSparkle> I liked BC2. But then it got a bit boring.
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't have the patience for that game anymore.
*ThePretender is air conducting along to the music.
<MrEvergreen> May I ask everypony a question?
<TrollightSparkle> Then, it got better when I created a secondary account and spammed the Gustav on teammate's helicopters.
<Nittany_Tiger> I had some fun, then followed by extreme frustration.
<TrollightSparkle> MrEvergreen, Sure.
*Ceiling|Dumori Climbs back on the celing
<TrollightSparkle> Is Ceiling|Dumori watching us now?
<MrEvergreen> Is there anypony here that's proficient/experienced with UnrealScript and Kismet Tree manipulation?
<Ceiling|Dumori> yep
<ThePretender> good thing I'm not clopping!
<Ceiling|Dumori> I log thsi chat for lulz
<Ceiling|Dumori> so I can never leave due to OCD
<Ceiling|Dumori> x3
<TrollightSparkle> MrEvergreen, Sorry, I have no idea :/
<Ceiling|Dumori> Ceiling Dumori logs your chat
<Nittany_Tiger> These modern multiplayer FPSs aren't balanced because players that have put more time into it get better weapons. Then you have killstreaks that reward skilled players with crap to kill more people.
<ThePretender> more Ace COmbat music <3
<Nittany_Tiger> People like me who aren't good at MP can't enjoy these games.
<Tovler> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpYloHajJNs
<Nittany_Tiger> Because it's balanced against poorly-skilled players.
<TrollightSparkle> I'm hit and miss with MP.. I can be amazing one day, and absolute crap the next.
<Nittany_Tiger> I used to have more patience to get pretty good online.
<Nittany_Tiger> I enjoyed my first MP romp into RTCW.
<Natleyn> I'd like a balanced FPS with vehicles, but we all know that isn't ever going to happen. >_>
<MrEvergreen> Thank you though.
<Natleyn> Closest thing we have is some version of Battlefield.
<TrollightSparkle> Of course Evergreen.
<Nittany_Tiger> I wasn't good at the start, but I got better and enjoyed my victories.
<Nittany_Tiger> Best of all, no stats or unlocks.
<TrollightSparkle> I'm really hoping BF3 turns out alright. I haven't played BF2, but I plan to get it soon.
<Nittany_Tiger> I hated BF2.
<Nittany_Tiger> It put a sour taste in MP gaming that never left.
<Nittany_Tiger> It was difficult to learn yet I got my ass kicked all of the time.
<Nittany_Tiger> Similar to BC2.
<ThePretender> awww, no more favorites from me XD
<prince-dari> OH LOL
<prince-dari> THIS
<prince-dari> THIS VIDEO
<prince-dari> HAHAHAHAHA
<prince-dari> INB4 furries

*TrollightSparkle magically teleports smores to Natleyn.
<prince-dari> Who requested this?
<Natleyn> :'3!
<Tovler> Yo
*ThePretender is trying to fight sleep.
<prince-dari> Whoever made this video is an epic troll.

<Tovler> This video is a classic
<prince-dari> >huge buildup
<TrollightSparkle> Well of course!

<GGgala> dari y u no in request channel
<TrollightSparkle> And what's the name of the vid?
<Nittany_Tiger> Buffering :<
<prince-dari> The Northern Incident
<GGgala> It was <Tovler> Yo
<TrollightSparkle> Ok, thanks Dari.
<prince-dari> [05:13] <prince-dari> INB4 furries

<prince-dari> LordCelestia: Eeyup.
<TrollightSparkle> Call of Duty is hit and miss LordCelestia.
<LordCelestia> Well ive been working on a COD- MLP crossover type deal
<TrollightSparkle> Sounds interesting
<Natleyn> stupid buffer ;~;
<LordCelestia> It's in progress but im basically swithing characters to be MLP ponies and weapons like I changed the grenade launcher to an apple launcher
<LordCelestia> http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/#/d4a3oc9
<Natleyn> Hiya NewDCD

<LordCelestia> Thanks. Im trying to figure out stuff to throw in for each mission of MW2 and BLack Ops
*Natleyn rages at buffer
<LordCelestia> Rainbow Dash is gonna be Reznov :p
<hero_spirit> Who's the streamer? :0

*TrollightSparkle hugs Natleyn, it'll be alright :)
<hero_spirit> the premier I watched was this morning?
<GGgala> oh boy, secret buffer fun
<Tovler> I ended up going to an empty Justintv stream.
<hero_spirit> It feels like it was two days ago
<TrollightSparkle> Oh, and LordCelestia does this mean we'll have mindfucking ponies to go along with that brutal action?
<GGgala> any advice, NewDCD?
<TrollightSparkle> You know "MASON, WHAT DO THE NUMBERS MEAN?"
<NewDCD> I'm on my phone IRC client
*Natleyn hugs TrollightSparkle back
<NewDCD> so I'm not watchan the streaman
<Tovler> Man, episode had a huge cliffhanger unlike the Nightmare Moon one.
<TrollightSparkle> Android or iOS NewDCD?
<LordCelestia> No, more like "PINKIE PIE. FOR THE LAST TIME. WHERE... IS... THE NUMBERS STATION."
<NewDCD> Blackberry
<NewDCD> Hopefully switching to a Galaxy Ace soon
<LordCelestia> How many times! Trixie was at Rebirth Island. We had to kill Trixie!
<ThePretender> HNNNNGH THEY DRAWING ONOX FROMORACLE OF SEASONS
<hero_spirit> Dari, you streaming? :0
<TrollightSparkle> Ah, Galaxy phones are really nice..
<prince-dari> Nope.
<ThePretender> second best zelda game I've played
<prince-dari> GGgala
<prince-dari> is
<NewDCD> BBs suck balls
<NewDCD> But this 8520 Curve was like the only affordable smartphone in this country
<ThePretender> first is Wind Waker
<hero_spirit> aight.
<LordCelestia> Trixies gonna be steiner, and Rainbow is reznov, so itll go something like this
<Natleyn> Can I get a video link to this? >_>
<GGgala> NewDCD, i did stream MLP G1 after you left successfully
<Tovler> I'm already declaring Skyward the best Zelda
<GGgala> been continuing since
<NewDCD> that and data throttling in my country sucked donkey dick till recently
<NewDCD> 10 bucks for 1GBof Monthly 3G usage
<Revolver> dat moon face
<NewDCD> for non-Blackberry phones
<NewDCD> so yeah
*zaco greets prince-dari
<LordCelestia> Interrogator: "Pinkie Pie! WHERE... IS... THE NUMBERS SATTION!" pinkie: "how many times, Trixie was at Rebirth Island, we had to kill Trixie!" Interrogator: "We? Rainbow Dashnov?" Pinkie: "Rainbow finally got what she wanted... Revenge..."
<NewDCD> luckily they have eliminated throttling now that thet introduced "4G" (bullshit I know)
<Tovler> Hero's Shade. sweet
<prince-dari> Hey.
<LordCelestia> ^Whaddaya think?
<prince-dari> Fuck.
<NewDCD> but it's really convenient because I can now get a 3.5G Phone, the Galaxy Ace, with an unlimited data plan for 10 bucks a month
<zaco> what the...
<prince-dari> Who can draw like this? O___o
<NewDCD> plus the actual phone bill
<TrollightSparkle> I have to go everypony, it was nice talking to you all!
<LordCelestia> Alright
*Natleyn hugs TrollightSparkle goodnight

<LordCelestia> Get in the cannon
<Natleyn> Sleep well, and thanks for the smores! :3
<Tovler> nighto
*TrollightSparkle gets in the cannon. Fire away sir.
*LordCelestia launches TrollightSparkle to the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<TrollightSparkle> DAMMMITITTTTTTTTTT
<LordCelestia> Bye! :D
<NewDCD> we should probably look into making our own RTMP Server on Sathi's rig
<LordCelestia> Returns to business
<NewDCD> and see just how much of a viewer load she can manage
<prince-dari> MFW the curosr flies around and detail just splurges out everywhere
<prince-dari> cursor*
<prince-dari> NewDCD: Sure.
<Revolver> thats cause the artist is a demigod or some stit
<NewDCD> I'm just wondering
<Revolver> *shit
<ThePretender> wow
<Natleyn> Dari, this is why I want to be an artist
<ThePretender> just....wow
<NewDCD> her UL is about 20 Mbps, right?
<Polarfire> I got one
<prince-dari> 34
<Polarfire> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Etyefd24yds&feature=player_embedded
<LordCelestia> Guys, I gotta go now.
<Natleyn> Also, nevermind.
*Natleyn hugs LordCelestia goodnight
<ThePretender> peace, LordCelestia
<LordCelestia> Thanks.
<Natleyn> GET IN DAT CANNON, BOYO
<LordCelestia> No need to launch me, Imma fly away blissfully in the sunset.
<Natleyn> Oh.
<Natleyn> Okay.
<NewDCD> well let's say it's 20, and we stream at about .5 Mbps
<NewDCD> Wouldn't she only be able to stream to like to 40 viewers or so?
*Natleyn noms blissfully on a marshmellow
<hero_spirit> Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
*LordCelestia flies blissfully off into sunset until some magic force beyond his control stops him and sends him back down to earth
<Tovler> I wonder if he'll pull a george lucas and add more Skyward characters?
<prince-dari> Not sure DCD.
<prince-dari> Only one way to find out.
<LordCelestia> Damn, I guess i need to be launched
<NewDCD> yeah
*LordCelestia gets into cannon "guys, make sure you hit the FIRE BLISSFULLY button this time"
*Natleyn smacks the FIRE BLISSFULLY button
<ThePretender> BEE-YETCH
*Natleyn hugs prince-dari
<NewDCD> that's our mission objective for the week
<LordCelestia> Actually, I wanted to be launched to BEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDAH
<LordCelestia> try again
<LordCelestia> :D
<hero_spirit> Awwwww
<hero_spirit> Request ignored? :[
<Tovler> r.i.p. Season 1
<LordCelestia> I guess so
<LordCelestia> Whatever, the moon is peaceful to sleep on i guess
<NewDCD> establishing our own streaming service and testing its capacity via a stress test
<Revolver> sounds like fun
<LordCelestia> Alright ill cope with my moon sleep. See you guys.
<Natleyn> Bye!
<ThePretender> later
<NewDCD> we should also issue a formal apology for the 300~ish viewers we lost
<NewDCD> and explain what occured in that situation
<Tovler> Too bad we couldn't perform an actual stress test.
<NewDCD> I'd also like to ask Sumica to see if he could upgrade his internet, just in case
<NewDCD> Tovler: that wasn't the problem
<NewDCD> we handled at the peak capacity just fine
<prince-dari> It kind of was.
<NewDCD> and it was great for 12 hours of nonstop streaming
<NewDCD> nah Dari
<NewDCD> I'm sure it was just owncast
<Natleyn> dem quality pictures of an episode released this morning
<prince-dari> Yeah, and if the stress test had worked, we'd have known that.
<Natleyn> Goddamn, bronies, goddamn.
<NewDCD> remember what happened during my Z2 stream with barely 90 viewers?
<Tovler> weren't there potentially hundreds of other people lurking?
<hero_spirit> I desperately want this streamed: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4&feature=fvwrel
<Natleyn> ^
<Natleyn> SO MUCH
*Natleyn hugs hero_spirit and swings him around
<hero_spirit> XD
<NewDCD> additionally it kept happening hours later, when we had viewers on the double digits
<Tovler> Nintendo at TSG had a better Zelda retrospective.
<Revolver> DAT MOON FACE!
<NewDCD> logical conclusion? Owncast servers are not very stable
<MeteorVenture> already had my few days of that stuck in my head
<ThePretender> ORACLE GAMES
<Tovler> was too busy playing pokemon to even think about the oracle games.
<ThePretender> WIND WAKER <3 BEST ZELDA GAME
<Natleyn> dat ww. <3
<NewDCD> so yeah Dari
<NewDCD> Either owncast picks the worst times for mainteinance, or they're just unstable as sin
<Natleyn> Hates gonna hate sailin'
<Revolver> Windwaker was awesome
<Tovler> Do Celda haters still exist?
<Natleyn> Poll: replay windwaker?
<Revolver> If I still had it
<ThePretender> YES
<Natleyn> Aight.
<Tovler> The last game Pig Ganon was in
<Natleyn> I haven't played that in forever.
<Natleyn> Fluttersy`? o-o
<ThePretender> same
<Fluttershy`> >>
<Fluttershy`> <<
<Revolver> Fluttershy`
*Natleyn hugs Fluttershy`
<Natleyn> What are you doing, silly? :3
*Revolver hugs Fluttershy` gently
<Tovler> 4 swords was too much fun
<Natleyn> ... maybe I should replay minish cap too
<Fluttershy`> hi guys
<Natleyn> >.>
<Revolver> I only remember playing Wind Waker
<NewDCD> Furottashai as in 'drew our banner for the premiere' Flutts?
<Natleyn> I have enough in my backlog not to replay games, but god, minish cap was awesome
<Tovler> Minish was nifty
<GGgala> i liek fried brains
<Revolver> and I played Twilight Princess
<ThePretender> fun fact: never played Twilight Princess
<GGgala> lol, mfw He-Man
<prince-dari> Twilight Princess is the only Zelda game I've ever played.
<Tovler> Midna left a hole in my heart
<Natleyn> I'm currently replaying Twilight Princess
<hero_spirit> Iknoright Tovler?
<Revolver> I sold my wii for a 360 and new pc
<Natleyn> ... Midna. ;~;
<hero_spirit> Do it GG. Do it.
<NewDCD> don't worry guys
<Natleyn> NewDCD: Or in Lagann's case, Midnia
<Tovler> that mirror shattered and you knew you would never see her again.
<NewDCD> Link probably breaks a hole into the Twili world with Spiral Power a few years afterwards
<Natleyn> Do eet? ;~;
<ThePretender> ah, good old Gurren Lagann today
<GGgala> you'll see it when your past catches up to my future :P
<hero_spirit> but who we should ALL feel bad for
<Natleyn> I'm angry at myself for missing the ending of Lagann-hen
<ThePretender> choo choo!
<Tovler> lol, train
<hero_spirit> is Link.
<Natleyn> Was this any good? >_>
<ThePretender> same-ish, Natleyn
<Revolver> I'm angry about missing the beginning of the first movie
<Natleyn> People said general gameplay was better, but... eh.
<Natleyn> Okay
<Tovler> Yes, only because Zelda is the annoying sidekick
<ThePretender> I missed more chances for heroic speeches
<hero_spirit> EVERY time, he finishes a quest, then everyone's like "kthxbai" and they leave him alone in a forest or some shit.
<hero_spirit> Alright :p
<GGgala> annd then Polarfire's
<GGgala> ohhh dis one
<Tovler> Nintendo, y u no 25 years of Metroid?
<ThePretender> agreed, Tovler
<Tovler> o yeah, because Metroid was ignored for like 10 year

<ThePretender> until MP
<GGgala> oh Polarfire <3

*Natleyn sings along

<Tovler> you sure you weren't given apple dippers by mistake?
<prince-dari> Apple + cheese
<Fluttershy`> 8Apple and cheese
<prince-dari> For the epic win.

<SuperBrony64> Well, I do like Provologne.
<Fluttershy`> 8tried...
<SuperBrony64> I like creamy cheeses rather than the sharp stuff
<Fluttershy`> 8well, not sure hot to spell it
<Fluttershy`> 8wendsly dale? >> fail
<prince-dari> I tried some really good cheese in France.
<prince-dari> There was even goat's cheese, THAT DIDN'T TASTE LIKE GOAT.
<SuperBrony64> wensleydale
<prince-dari> That was a first for me.
<prince-dari> It actually tasted nice.
<Fluttershy`> 8I liek certain goat cheeses
<SuperBrony64> France…*sigh*
<SuperBrony64> I want to go visit there someday
<Tovler> Smoked salmon & Israeli feta on a bed of cherry tomatoes & mixed greens and baby spinach. Splashed with a home-made mustard vinaigrette.
<prince-dari> Been to France sooooooooooooooooo many times.
<prince-dari> We go pretty much every other year.
<SuperBrony64> prince-dari: Have to rub it in? :P
<Fluttershy`> 8I miss Japan ;__;
<Tovler> How are the macarons there?
<prince-dari> I can't believe how little people seem to leave the country in America.
<SuperBrony64> The closest I've been out of the United States was going to Mexico
<SuperBrony64> I want to leave, but it's darn expensive
<Fluttershy`> 8I've been to Wales, Canada, Mexico, Japan, France... and all over teh US
<prince-dari> Go to airport, fly somewhere.
<prince-dari> Spend 2 weeks.
<prince-dari> Fly back.
<prince-dari> O_o
<SuperBrony64> I don't want to go to Mexico and there's really no reason for me to go to Canada (besides seeing relatives)
<Fluttershy`> 8I love traveling <3
<SuperBrony64> prince-dari: Costs ton of money for flight, plus where do I stay once I'm there?
<Fluttershy`> 8SuperBrony64: get drunk party
<Fluttershy`> 8just kidding >>
<SuperBrony64> Drunk imagination vacations just don't work :P
<Fluttershy`> 8I've never smoked, had alcohol or any kind of drugs before in my life o-o
<SuperBrony64> The last time I went on vacation somewhere was like…4-5 years ago.
<prince-dari> I've been to Wales, Scottland, Ibiza, Portugal, the US, France, Italy, Greece (mainland and Zakynthos), and St. Lucia.
<prince-dari> As far as I can remember.
<SuperBrony64> Actually, more like 2-3, I did visit New York
<Fluttershy`> 8prince-dari oooohhh coool
<SuperBrony64> Do you live in the US?
<prince-dari> Who?
<SuperBrony64> You. :P
<prince-dari> Nah, England.
<prince-dari> Just about everyone here leaves the country every year for a holiday.
<Fluttershy`> 8<3 London and I'm trying to remember the area but I can't think of it...
<Fluttershy`> 8Miss the castles in the UK...
<SuperBrony64> prince-dari: True, but then again, most of those places are nearby.
<SuperBrony64> Relative compared to how far it is from the US to Europe
<prince-dari> I've still been to the US. :P
<Fluttershy`> 8US... I like where I live thankfully... but that's because we have like 7 friggin national parks
<SuperBrony64> It's trouble visiting other states in the US because they are mostly the same :/
<Polarfire> Should I get on one of my costumes while we wait?
<GGgala> sure why not
<Polarfire> >:3
<SuperBrony64> It's way different to see what it's like in another country
<Polarfire> Which one do you want?
<SuperBrony64> I really hope to go somewhere in Europe when I graduate
<Polarfire> Dari's seen them.
<warhunterT71> Anypony here?
<prince-dari> Oh, heheheh.
<zaco> Yeah.
<SuperBrony64> *sigh* Oh well, a pony can dream :P
<Fluttershy`> 8look around for tours
<Fluttershy`> 8and stuff
<GGgala> what? tell me tell me tell me!
<Donraj> Yup
<prince-dari> Thinking back about holidays.
<prince-dari> Memories.
<prince-dari> Nostalgia.
<prince-dari> ;__;
<SuperBrony64> I don't wanna Tour, I want to go and visit places on my own
*Fluttershy` 8huggles prince-dari
<prince-dari> <3 Good times.
<Polarfire> You pick one Dari.
<SuperBrony64> That's the thing, I don't wanna be a 'tourist'. I want to actually try and blend in to the places I go.
<SuperBrony64> Americans always have that bed reputation while going to other countries...
<prince-dari> That's because
<prince-dari> >go to Stonehenge
<prince-dari> >Try to chip a piece off with a chisel
<prince-dari> >SOUVENIR! KASDOPFKASL:DFKAS :LDFAJSD:FLGSKD:G
<prince-dari> :P
<Fluttershy`> 8... I'm pretty sure that's illegal
<SuperBrony64> Is that what people do?
<prince-dari> Well I suppose we never finished off what happened last time. >_>
<SuperBrony64> Or is it the stereotype that Americans love souveniers?
<Polarfire> That's very stereotypical.... I don't personally know anyone who would do that.
<Tovler> Americans go to France and ask for a bud light.
<GGgala> <_<
<Polarfire> XD
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> My sister.
<prince-dari> Oh God.
<CTCB> Yup! Barely! :D
<SuperBrony64> I'd go to France and eat at the McDonalds first night there just to mess with people.
<prince-dari> In St Lucia, asked the barman.
<prince-dari> "Do you have any strongbow?"
<prince-dari> "Strongbow?"
<prince-dari> "I'll show you strongbow"
<prince-dari> "Sniff this, don't drink it"
<prince-dari> >she takes a sip
<prince-dari> >throat burning for next 30 minutes
<prince-dari> XD
<Fluttershy`> 8wow
<prince-dari> That was hilarious.
<Polarfire> Sluttershy, kinky_pie, I have many.
<prince-dari> MFW she thought they'd have strongbow.
<SuperBrony64> *goes to site*
<SuperBrony64> "Are you over the age of 21?" >Yes >No
<GGgala> >_>
<SuperBrony64> Ughh…uhhhh….uhhhhhhhhh
<GGgala> ^_^
<SuperBrony64> So many choices...
<Polarfire> Well, since Dari won't pick.... which one do you want?
<Fluttershy`> 8prince-dari: wow Dari you talk a lot. >> Spam kick? XP
<Polarfire> Also, story link yet XD
<GGgala> i think the best costume is nothing at all, honestly :P
<prince-dari> Pfft.
<SuperBrony64> inb4 Spam kick
<prince-dari> You probably can't kick me.
<prince-dari> :P
<Fluttershy`> 8I wonder if I can'
<SuperBrony64> /sendtothemoon prince-dari
<Polarfire> well, I say costumes but they are really just characters.
<Fluttershy`> 8that would be interesting wouldn't it?
<prince-dari> INB4 we find out
<SuperBrony64> Hmm…that command doesn't work...
<GGgala> but Sluttershy is cool.
<GGgala> amd i know :P
<GGgala> ...and
<GGgala> not affiliated with the cpu/graphics company
<warhunterT71> Still here?
<SuperBrony64> inb4 Invading Ponies
<SuperBrony64> Damn
<prince-dari> Heheh.
<Fluttershy`> 8o-o
<Donraj> Ayup
<SuperBrony64> I'm good
<warhunterT71> I'm about to upload my fanfic, but i'm thinking of editing a few things
<GGgala> so Sluttershy... as long as it doesn't affect your awesome voice
<Fluttershy`> 8that was...
<Fluttershy`> 8>>
<Fluttershy`> 8interesting
*Shadowmane walks into the room. "Hmm, interesting..."
<Fluttershy`> 8GAH
<Fluttershy`> 8Shadowmane is evil!
<warhunterT71> Choosing between Derpy and Ditzy's name, for example
<Fluttershy`> 8I know he's evil!
<Polarfire> Oh. Well Sluttershy will be here for the pre-party.
<Polarfire> wait....
<Shadowmane> Evil? My my, such a thing applied to me?
<Polarfire> not sure of the proper terminology for that XD
<warhunterT71> But firstly, if you saw a fanfic titled 'Friendship is Surreal', what would be you first impression?
<GGgala> fluffing?
<Fluttershy`> 8>>
*Fluttershy` 8goes back to normal Fluttershy` mode instead of Flutterrage
<SuperBrony64> How…how…how could you?
<Shadowmane> If the children are born, perhaps it is too late for that.
<Donraj> That it will be delightfully surreal
<SuperBrony64> What's the accent on your name Fluttershy` ?
<Fluttershy`> 8Fluttershy is for bot use only... =_+
<SuperBrony64> Hmm...
<warhunterT71> I mean, its a comedy, but not a particularily crazy/random one
<SuperBrony64> Oh damn, I remember that now
*Shadowmane tuts at the sad situation.
*zaco thinks of the game Myst
<CTCB> My first impression would be "This takes place on another planet or during a dream...
<prince-dari> Lawl, Myst.
<Fluttershy`> 8I am more powerful than you here!
<Shadowmane> Hmm... violetvanilla is it? Such a lovely young filly... how are you this fair eve?
<prince-dari> Old games are old.
<warhunterT71> Not sure what to make of that description... lol
<Polarfire> anyway....
<zaco> Yeah.
<Fluttershy`> 8If you even put one hoof on me OR VIOLETVANILLA I will kick your sorry ass to the MOON!
<warhunterT71> never heard of myst
<Polarfire> Oh look, I brought a guest.
<Polarfire> Imma leave for a minute.
<CTCB> warhunterT71: Really?!
<CTCB> One of the biggest video games in history
<warhunterT71> Yep.
<Fluttershy`> 8I mean. Um...
<Fluttershy`> 8B-Because I can... and... I don't like you... -squeaks- ><
<CTCB> It's a series of puzzle games, set on a worlds... with puzzles and realms linked with books, that you put your hand on and materialze to the next world...
<Shadowmane> *sigh* Miss Fluttershy`, as much as I may or may not desire otherwise, I would never do such a thing. Poaching is not proper behavior for a true gentlecolt.
<CTCB> With real people in it too at times, shot on chromakey
<Fluttershy`> 8I... I still don't like you... ><
<CTCB> warhunterT71: ^^ Basic Info on it...
<CTCB> :)
<warhunterT71> Well, i'm probably gonna upload my fic now under the name friendship is surreal, unless i can think of a better name
<warhunterT71> Not particularily focused on friendship, though...
<prince-dari> I was too young for the game when I first played it, it confused the hell out of me. XD
<Donraj> I never played it
<Shadowmane> That is quite alright. I do not need your approval, simply your acceptance that i am here for now.
<CTCB> I played the third game, then the 2nd and the 1st, then the 4th and the 5th
*zaco actually visited Cyan Worlds
<Fluttershy`> 8I JUST NOTICED that there's a gingerale in this room <3
<prince-dari> I think I played Myst 3.
<gingerale> D:
<warhunterT71> On Deviantart, can you just upload word documents?
<MissingPony> A what?
<prince-dari> The first game came out 2 years before I was born.
<MissingPony> Oh!
<MissingPony> Hi!
<zaco> I got to see End of Ages material before the game came out
*Fluttershy` 8hugs gingerale tightly
*gingerale hugs back <3
<CTCB> prince-dari: It's called "Myst III: Exile"
*MissingPony just got here, so has a better excuse than Fluttershy'.
<CTCB> zaco: Do u remember Myst Uru online?
<gingerale> So what is this about? ^^
<zaco> Yeah
<CTCB> It was released by cyan
<zaco> I sometimes poke on their once in awhile
<MissingPony> What's what about?
<CTCB> about 2 months ago
<GGgala> inb4 Sluttershy
<CTCB> for free
<Fluttershy`> 8I love gingerale <3 It's my favorite soda
<zaco> Yeah I have the free version
<gingerale> Ahh.. xD
<zaco> though I bought the game when it came out
<Tovler> There's a Shadow of the Colossus rip-off in Skyward Sword? Sold.
<prince-dari> Huh, we call it ginger beer I think.
<CTCB> I kinda hate the 5th game
<prince-dari> I like it too.
<zaco> I never got around to end of ages
<CTCB> zaco: Don't play it...
<Fluttershy`> 8ginger beer is stronger than gingerale actually... much more gingery but I like ginger beer too <3
<CTCB> It's laggy, and slow...
<Sluttershy> umm... Hi
<zaco> the real time 3d stuff seemed like kinda a bummer
<CTCB> and the puzzles suck!
<Sluttershy> heh... thankyou.
<Tovler> I only want African Creme or Bailey's
<CTCB> End of Ages killed the series
<zaco> Uru wasn't particularily good either even though I enjoyed it
<zaco> the online component of that game was completely broken
<CTCB> What made them jump from Myst 4... to Myst 5
<prince-dari> Hah, my sister loves Baileys
<CTCB> One with FMV Scenes
<GGgala> but of course.
<CTCB> suddenly to complete 3D
<prince-dari> My dad put lemon juice in it.
<prince-dari> >curdle king
<prince-dari> Are you beginning to see why he has that name yet?
<Fluttershy`> 8pickles and milk... doesn't sit well in my stomach... e-e
<zaco> So myst 5 has no live action guys?
<CTCB> zaco: None at all
<zaco> That's pretty terrible
<CTCB> Not one second
<Sluttershy> *cough....*
<CTCB> Completely 3D Dudes, speaking
<SuperBrony64> I like Olives
<gingerale> Plain pickles and milk, I can understand.. <.<
<zaco> Sounds lazy
<SuperBrony64> Green one specifically.
<zaco> going that direction
<Tovler> finally, my cloud is here. I'd better take it before it passes.
<Fluttershy`> 8I like purple olives and green olives both
<gingerale> Huh
*Sluttershy scrapes the ground nervously
*Tovler dreams of furries in the arctic.
<zaco> Though to be fair, at the time that game came out, Cyan Worlds was on the brink of basically being disbanded
<zaco> and they did
<CTCB> I played it for 10 minutes, then I put the CD in the Microwave and watched it burn in hell...
<SuperBrony64> I'm guilty of drinking the juice that remains in the Olive jar :3
<zaco> but they're still kinda around, being saved at the last minute
<CTCB> XD
<warhunterT71> Oh, god, Deviantart is complex, lol
<SuperBrony64> Well, not a lot of it
<prince-dari> Tovler: Lawl
<gingerale> Someone added cutiemarks to the Equestria Online source. Sweet! xD
<CTCB> I really want another Myst Game
<CTCB> One that's more like Myst III
<CTCB> The Engine was perfect
<prince-dari> Question of the day: What's the difference between a gherkin and a pickle?
<MissingPony> Custom or a selection of cutie marks?
<gingerale> I don't think they've made a final decision on that. ^^
<gingerale> So I won't say anything.
<MissingPony> Okay : )
<SuperBrony64> Gherkin's are sweet?
<zaco> Yeah but it seems like its done at this point
<Fluttershy`> 8Your mom
<zaco> they said myst 5 was the end
<prince-dari> SuperBrony64: Nope.
<prince-dari> I don't actually know.
<prince-dari> But I know it's not that.
<prince-dari> :P
<Fluttershy`> 8... you troll
<Fluttershy`> 8>>
<CTCB> Yeah, but they've already broke that rule
<CTCB> by re-releasing Uru
<zaco> well no they didn't, they didn't re-release uru
<gingerale> Gherkins aren't cucumbers. Pickles are.
<zaco> well
<zaco> I guess they did, sorta, rebranded as Myst Online
<zaco> but they didn't make new assets
<Fluttershy`> 8gingerale knows all! <3
*gingerale IS SMRT
<prince-dari> I don't think that's true in the UK.
<prince-dari> Maybe in the US.
<MissingPony> I wonder how many problems with inappropriate symbols they would have, and whether the Brony community would continue as it has been and not use middle fingers and anatomy as cutie marks...
<CTCB> I really think they should start an open source project
<CTCB> to create a new Myst Game
<CTCB> Instead of them making it...
<gingerale> Well there's this incredibly cool skill system under works for it. So I'm hoping the cutiemarks will reflect that. ^^
<Fluttershy`> 8My cat is a wimp...
<CTCB> people adding to it...
<MissingPony> Nice!
<The_Mole> hi.
<prince-dari> MissingPony: It's simple to have it so custom cutie marks have to be approved
<zaco> People could probably just take matters into their own hands and just make fan games without fear of lawsuit
<zaco> because no one will care
<CrystalClear> Hello dearies! :D <3
<The_Mole> hello.
<The_Mole> just thinking bout the new episode...
*CrystalClear pats Fluttershy` on the head, kisses Prince-Dari on the cheek, and gives a quick hug to The_Mole
<MissingPony> prince-dari: Depends on the size of the user-base and number of mods...
<CTCB> But isn't what they are doing with Uru Online
<The_Mole> aw thanks
<prince-dari> Number of users I doubt would be more than 50,000 at most.
<The_Mole> *gives hug back to CrystalClear*
<CTCB> in a way saying "Do as you wish with this..."
*Fluttershy` 8blinks. "Huh?"
<The_Mole> actually...
<SuperBrony64> I don't get any signs of affection?
<MissingPony> Though they could have it so anyone who submitted for a custom mark could be a blank flank or use a preset until their mark was approved.
<SuperBrony64> Don't worry about me! I'll be okay
<The_Mole> i was just about to...
<SuperBrony64> I'll just go back over in the corner of the internet here...
<The_Mole> *hug for superbrony64*
<The_Mole> and
<The_Mole> *hugs for everypony*
<CTCB> Also, Rand Miller has really aged over the Past 5 or so years since Myst IV
<Fluttershy`> 8I have an announcement...
*Fluttershy` 8turns into a tree
<SuperBrony64> ???
<SuperBrony64> :O
<MissingPony> SuperBrony64: I haven't gotten any affection either. But, then again, I'm Missing : )
<MissingPony> Hard to show affection to somepony who's missing.
*CrystalClear takes a nap under Fluttershy`-Tree
<MissingPony> Lol.
<MissingPony> Fluttershy wood do that!
<MissingPony> (pun intended)
*CrystalClear pats MissingPony and SuperBrony64 on the head. "You know I'd never forget you!"
<MeteorVenture> she wood
<MissingPony> Is that a pun or bad grammar?
<MissingPony> I can't tell.
<Fluttershy`> 8both? )
*MissingPony smiles at CrystalClear. "Thanks!"
<gingerale> http://i.imgur.com/RZ4FL.gif Discord Dance! \o/
<Letti> Guys, a little question:
<gingerale> No wait, this one. http://i.imgur.com/PIhVz.gif
<MeteorVenture> bracing for epic question
<Letti> Did anybody here saved a log of the chat when the chapter aired?
<SuperBrony64> I do
<SuperBrony64> Well, my client automatically does it
<SuperBrony64> But if I dug through it with some effort I could find something...
<Letti> What's your client?
<Sluttershy> Well I guess I... I'll just leave then.
<zaco> Yeah.
<zaco> I saw rand miller through glass :(
<SuperBrony64> Colloquy
<zaco> never got to actually meet him
<CTCB> I wonder if Cyan would ever release the First 4 Games on iOS?
<MissingPony> Mobile?
<CTCB> I'd love to see that...
<Fluttershy`> 8hey guys I'm tired if you're spamming tell me okay? lol
<Fluttershy`> 8so then I can kick you XP
<SuperBrony64> I think I've been Spamming...
<CrystalClear> Spamming? Oh dear, sounds like a waste of ham. Which you shouldn't eat, as herbivores can't process meat.
<Fluttershy`> 8oh u..
<The_Mole> ah, what? me spam? never....
<warhunterT71> Stupid Deviantart title character limit...
<The_Mole> (wonders, "would i?")
<CrystalClear> i
<CrystalClear> think
<CrystalClear> you
<CrystalClear> would
<CrystalClear> if
<CrystalClear> you
<CrystalClear> were
<CrystalClear> feeling
<CrystalClear> up
<CrystalClear> to
<CrystalClear> it
<CrystalClear> :D
<The_Mole> hmmmmm
<The_Mole> if i was paid a million dollars i would feel up to it...
<The_Mole> probably
<The_Mole> its a million... oh wait.
<The_Mole> million bits!
<The_Mole> soooooo
<CrystalClear> Fluttershy`: Really
*Fluttershy` 8falls over (still as a tree)
<The_Mole> oh no :O
<warhunterT71> Do you guys think that 'surreal friendship' is an acceptable substitute for 'friendship is surreal'? DA character limit...
<Letti> SuperBrony64: The log it could be in ~/Library/Application Support/Colloquy/
<The_Mole> *helps fluttershy up*
<MeteorVenture> stream non-stop hamtaro till next episode
<The_Mole> (well....)
<The_Mole> its 3:10 am here...
<The_Mole> yay
<The_Mole> so.
<gingerale> I wish Minecraft had pink leaved trees ^^
<The_Mole> i suppose i can say
<The_Mole> i have a fever...
<gingerale> Maybe I should edit the textures to make birch trees have pink leaves
<The_Mole> and the only prescription is more ponies.
<The_Mole> eeyup
<MeteorVenture> hey actually.. during those random streams of shows.. was detective conan/case closed ever shown?
<The_Mole> either that or chat
<Fluttershy`> 8mmm.......
<Polarfire> So then.
<The_Mole> cant say
<Polarfire> Dari?
*Fluttershy` 8turns back into regular Fluttershy` "so tired..."
<The_Mole> im only here on occasion
<MeteorVenture> alright well that's one thing i really wanna see.. i wonder what watching that with a chatroom full of people would be like
<The_Mole> have to wonder if theyll stream "are you afraid of the dark?" next month
<The_Mole> i used to watch it as a kid...
<MeteorVenture> i've definitely seen that.. don't really remember it all that much
<gingerale> I've drawn Detective Conan fanart once. For a friend. She was making a story where poor Conan ended up posing as a girl.
<gingerale> So I drew him in a dress. ^^
<MeteorVenture> just the lighting of the match or whatnot
<zaco> wait how is "Friendship is surreal" too long?
<Polarfire> Dari
<Polarfire> you didn't fall asleep on me did you?
<MeteorVenture> sorry i'm not into guys.. link anyway? for science?
<GGgala> dari-beep, dari-beep, dari-beep
<warhunterT71> and 'chapter 1'
<warhunterT71> doesn't fit, stupid DA
<Fluttershy`> 8she blinded me with science!
<MeteorVenture> lol but seriously i wonder how that would turn out
<zaco> friendship is surreal s1?
<zaco> errr
*CrystalClear levitates Fluttershy` off the ground and into bed. "You need some rest, dearie. My boy has enough trouble on his hoofs without a grumpy filly."
<zaco> c1
<SuperBrony64> Okay, I'm back
<SuperBrony64> Now then, Letti, what did you mean by the new chapter?
<warhunterT71> lol
<gingerale> If anyone wants to see the Conan drawing's here. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13406580/conan%20fanarty.png
<warhunterT71> or i could change the name
<gingerale> Took me forever to get the hang of the original artist's style xD
<Polarfire> I'm guessin he did :(
<warhunterT71> it's not 100% yet
<Fluttershy`> 8ggrbbb....
<gingerale> But eh, it didn't turn out too bad at all.
<Letti> No, the last chapter.
<SuperBrony64> Last chapter of what?
<warhunterT71> The name only allows 30 characters
<zaco> I suppose it depends on what it's about. Obviously Friendship is Surreal is supposed to be a play on "Friendship is Magic"
<MeteorVenture> that's 100X better than i expected
<GGgala> fifteen minutes, no messages
<CrystalClear> hmm? What was that, Flutter dear?
<GGgala> maybe
<warhunterT71> yep
*Fluttershy` 13wonders if pink is taken by other mod
<SuperBrony64> Octavia has pink I think...
*Fluttershy` 8is sticking to yellow then
<SuperBrony64> Or VioletVanilla
<warhunterT71> It's a humorous mirror of the show using a set of BG ponies
<The_Mole> well... its sunday. yay.
<SuperBrony64> I forget...
<CrystalClear> octavia
<warhunterT71> I'm thinking of doing Part 1, maybe?
<zaco> That could work
<The_Mole> btw... i feel like saying "are you afraid of the darK" seems to only be aired in october now...
<Letti> The first chapter of the second season.
<The_Mole> even though it was aired all the time in the 90s...
<SuperBrony64> The_Mole: Is that show still on the air?
<warhunterT71> I was hoping to use part 1 as the chapter name, buuuut
<prince-dari> No, I'm still here.
<SuperBrony64> I used to watch it all the time.
<Fluttershy`> 8does yellow stand out ok?
<The_Mole> in reruns, yes
<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy`: More than enough :P
<The_Mole> though the original series ended in 1997 or something
<CrystalClear> yellow on black? quite well Flutter dear.
<warhunterT71> you see, since it mirrors the show, the first two chapter were going to be Ch1 part 1 and Ch2 part 2
<The_Mole> i actually remember when it ended...
<SuperBrony64> For my black background, yes/
<Fluttershy`> 8hehehehhehhehhehhehhehehhehhehhehe I mean in all the white
<Polarfire> DARI <3
<warhunterT71> with a name inbetween, of course
<Polarfire> We thought we's lost you.
<warhunterT71> But then i could rename chapter 2 and call them all parts
<SuperBrony64> Lemme find out
<MeteorVenture> well thanks for teh linkz gingerale you draw pretty darn good
<prince-dari> <3 still here just about XD
<The_Mole> then there was a reboot of the show in 1998, i think. didnt last long, fans dont seem to like it as much but i thought it was alright
<gingerale> Thanke!
<Polarfire> well... time for fanfic then?
<SuperBrony64> Actually, it looks unreadable
<GGgala> you missed Sluttershy completely <_<
<Fluttershy`> 8I made teh marathon poster for last night... ;__; now my beautiful movie poster is no longer needed
<CrystalClear> it'll be stored for the annals, i'm sure
<GGgala> >a user named The_Mole on #BronyState. i can now command the servers to tell me /whois The_Mole ?!
<prince-dari> Hah.
<SuperBrony64> It was a nice poster.
<warhunterT71> actually, i'll rename chapter one
<prince-dari> Yes, read to us.
<gingerale> Your yellow text is distracting because whenever I'm mentioned it beeps and highlights the text in yellow. xD
<Polarfire> ok :3
<warhunterT71> leave chapter 2's name... hmmm...
<gingerale> So I keep thinking all those things you say are directed to me
<Shadowmane> *EHEM*
<SuperBrony64> You mean the one that has all the Mane 6 with various foods and drinks?
<Fluttershy`> 8gingerale hehehehe
<CrystalClear> SHADOW!!! *fan-squeal*
*Shadowmane looks at Crystalclear. "Oh shi-!"
<Fluttershy`> 8yes Shadowmane =_+ trolololololo
<Letti> SuperBrony64, the log looks unreadable?
<SuperBrony64> Letti: I still don't know what it is you are looking for...
<SuperBrony64> What last chapter?
*CrystalClear rushes Shadowmane, her magic locking down his shadowjump abilities.
<MeteorVenture> >fluttershy` start's using yellow text >gingerale's self-esteem shoots through the roof
<Shadowmane> Oh crap... *braces for impact*
<gingerale> Hahaha xD
<MissingPony> G'night y'all!
<prince-dari> My highlight text is red.
<SuperBrony64> Night MissingPony
<gingerale> Every line you speak, Fluttershy`, is another pump of air into my ego!
<Fluttershy`> 8prince-dari: no it's blue?
<MeteorVenture> goodnight missingpo :D
<gingerale> Stop while you're still safe!
<Fluttershy`> 8yay~
<gingerale> xD
<GGgala> my skype is ready
<gingerale> Goodnight, Missing <3
<prince-dari> I just check whether the name of the person/timestamp is red too when people type in red.
<Letti> When the first chapter of the second season, the yesterday morning chapter, if you have any logs of this chat when that chapter aired.
<prince-dari> Automatic reaction
<Polarfire> my bo- skype is ready also.
*CrystalClear glomps Shadowmane. "SHADOW! SHADOWSHADOWSHADOWSHADOOOOWWWW!!!"
<Fluttershy`> 8prince-dari: oohhh
<Polarfire> Dari?
<SuperBrony64> Letti: Oh I see, lemme check
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Fluttershy`> 8....
<Fluttershy`> 8whoever posted vid to 'safety dace Discord' congrats. It is now stuck in my head.
<Shadowmane> You can dance if you want to, you can leave your friends behind. Cuz your friends don't dance and if they don't dance then they're no friends of mine...
<Fluttershy`> 8....Shadowmane I can kick you for trolling I hope you know >>
*Shadowmane hugs CrystalClear lightly, a forced smile on his face. "Oh hey... Crystal... darling... how ermm... are you?"
<gingerale> Hmm.. Let's see..
<gingerale> Stuff starts at 3 pm today for the comic festival. ^^
<gingerale> Will need to go there <3
*CrystalClear turns on Fluttershy` "HOW DARE YOU THREATEN MY HUBBY"
<gingerale> Ohw ait no, noon!
<The_Mole> for some reason that is.... so fitting with the new episode
<SuperBrony64> Fry: That dance wasn't as safe as they said it was.
<Sumica> Hello all.
<The_Mole> hi
<The_Mole> welcome to the chat room
<Fluttershy`> 8I can kick you too CrystalClear if you get too annoying >>; mebbe
<gingerale> Yesterday I spotted a Kanaya and a Vriska cosplayer! <3
*Shadowmane fades into nothing as CrystalClear's shadow falls onto him. He wipes sweat from his brow as he does so
<gingerale> Wishing I had a camera D:
<CrystalClear> Oh poo... he got away again.
<The_Mole> i kept feeling upset that i stayed up late..
<CrystalClear> owell, I'll get him next time
<The_Mole> not anymore..
<Sumica> Oh grats on mod Fluttershy`
<The_Mole> well, since like half an hour ago
<Fluttershy`> 8oh thanks Sumica! <3
<SuperBrony64> Damn, the entire 15 MB transcript is still loading.
<The_Mole> oh yes.,... congrats on mod fluttershy...
<Letti> lol
<The_Mole> sounds like my mom is walking up the stairs...
<The_Mole> maybe...
<The_Mole> yes
<The_Mole> yes she did
<SuperBrony64> I don't think I have the transcript actually :/
<SuperBrony64> These files seem to just record whatever amount of the chat it feels like.
<gingerale> What is Fluttershy` a mod of?
<Letti> Really? Can you upload that anyway?
<Fluttershy`> 8gingerale: I am a mod for here )
<gingerale> But.. You don't have the powers. D:
<gingerale> Shouldn't you at least be half-opped?
<Fluttershy`> 8I am brand-new mod... only have kicking powers for now ^^;
<Fluttershy`> 8it's up to Dari to give me more power or not
<gingerale> Through a bot or something?
<The_Mole> if a cat was pestering your dog by staying in your yard, giving your dog fleas, what would you do
<gingerale> Ah, I gues you're just registered to the ChanServ? ^^
<The_Mole> because i have like three cats hanging around outside from time to time....
<The_Mole> would you take a squirt gun and squirt the cats?
<gingerale> *guess
<The_Mole> it comes to mind...
<gingerale> That makes you a sneaky mod!
<Fluttershy`> 8yeah
<The_Mole> all of a sudden... im enjoying "oranges and lemons", an album by XTC, a lot more
<The_Mole> hooray
<The_Mole> think im getting into it because of the bass lines...
*Fluttershy` 8lays down on ground. "Zzz...."
<The_Mole> oh.... my
<The_Mole> youre... not sawing longs are you
<gingerale> I love this ^^ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AePz1J1hZwo
<SuperBrony64> Colloquy, Y U GO AND FREEZE?!
<SuperBrony64> Anyway
<The_Mole> heh
<The_Mole> been trolled vid...
<SuperBrony64> Letti: I'll send you the transcript as long as it's okay with a Mod. I keep them for just personal reasons, but I don't want to give it out freely.
<The_Mole> ...
<SuperBrony64> Even though he is made from different parts of various species, he is 100% troll.
<Letti> It's ok, I understand.
*Silvermane has returned, let the shipping COMMENCE
<SuperBrony64> Okay, I put on my wizard hat and robe..
<Silvermane> Good. I select... THE_MOLE to be your partner, SuperBrony64. Enjoy.
<GGgala> any room for shipping CrystalClear/ShadowMane?
<SuperBrony64> *child innocence destroyed*
<Silvermane> GGgala, that's already been done. literally. it's canon
<Silvermane> hence why I exist... *cries*
<Fluttershy`> 8Oooh CC is your mommmmyyy?
<SuperBrony64> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH5TR6dtVzU <--Why can't I be as brave as these guys?!
<Fluttershy`> 8whahaha
<Fluttershy`> 8I will make you one don't worry and you can buy it from me sound good? I make better ponies than they have in store anyway prolly
<SuperBrony64> All I want to do is just get one of the small Fluttershy action figures. IS THAT SO MUCH TO ASK?!
<Silvermane> yes
<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy`: Really? Deal :P
<Silvermane> (because i have dibs on them all)
<Fluttershy`> 8I need to get my hands on clay of course first but I'm sure that wont be too hard to do
<Fluttershy`> 8to hard to do* ah what is happening to me?
<SuperBrony64> I hate what they did to Princess Celestia as a toy.
<SuperBrony64> I don't think she would be so inclined for some 'peasant' to comb her mane...
<Fluttershy`> 8yes...
<warhunterT71> Yeah. Uploading fic to DA like a boss.
<SuperBrony64> The main toys I would want are the toys that came with the McDonalds Happy Meals
<SuperBrony64> But those are lost with time :(
<Sumica> Well now that i finaly get to sit and enjoy the ep I must say it was quite good.
<SuperBrony64> The Return of Harmony Part 1?
<Silvermane> Episode 201
<SuperBrony64> I enjoyed it as a strong start for things to come in the show, but I felt it was very abrupt in the beginning.
<Sumica> Yes SuperBrony64
<Silvermane> i'm totally looking forward to when we have episode 1001 to brag about
<Sumica> Dose seem they just said oke play this role as if you would play Q
<SuperBrony64> Who's Q?
<Silvermane> Q as in... Bond? or... umm...
<Sumica> Q as in star trek
<SuperBrony64> Oh, never saw Star Trek (at least the newer one) :P
<SuperBrony64> I found this video of Q: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBwoEXlTph0
<SuperBrony64> Sounds exactly like Discord >_<
<Sumica> For reffrence http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M405eU4niYw&feature=related
<SuperBrony64> So…Q decided to troll ponies instead of star fleet?
<Sumica> exactly
<Sumica> liveing forever can get boreing I would guess.
<SuperBrony64> So, Data is a robot?
<Sumica> android
<Sumica> but yes
<Sumica> nice top comment on your link ">get bored trolling Starfleet captains
<Sumica> >go to﻿ Equestria and troll ponies instead
<Sumica> "
<warhunterT71> anypony still here?
<SuperBrony64> :P
<Donraj> Here
<Donraj> Got it uploaded?
<SuperBrony64> Blossom -> Twilight Sparkle, Bubbles -> Fluttershy, Buttercup -> Rainbow Dash
<SuperBrony64> There, I've made reason with the universe.
<Silvermane> oh Lauren Faust, why you so uber
<SuperBrony64> My God, what would happen if she remade My Little Pony: FiM with MORE Lauren Faust goodness...
<SuperBrony64> BTW, best Powerpuff Girls scene: http://youtu.be/gY93YDa8TiA
<Symmetry> I'm certainly not, warhunterT71
<Symmetry> I don't believe I've asked you yet, warhunter - do you know of any particularly good non-romantic/smut fanfics featuring Rarity?
<Sumica> So what names has everyone come up with for the corupted elements I am sure there are names already.
<Revolver> Elements of Chaos
<Sumica> ment the individual ponys. But that works too.
<SuperBrony64> Flutterbitch, Phonyjack, Snarity, Meanie Pie, and Run N' Dash
<SuperBrony64> Do I win?
<Sumica> uh i guess.
<warhunterT71> still here?
<warhunterT71> @symmetry no
<warhunterT71> @Donraj yep. here it is http://warhuntert71.deviantart.com/art/Friendship-is-Surreal-Part-1-258958587
<warhunterT71> Next, i'm going to spend the next half hour figuring out FF.net
<SuperBrony64> Let's all go watch the Time channel
<SuperBrony64> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4LSHvXE3TM&NR=1
<MeteorVenture> why is this moskau song SOOOOOOOOO good?
<warhunterT71> And, I have the second chapter already written, do you think i should upload it now?
<SuperBrony64> The same reason why rubbing a Q-tip in your ear feels soooooo good.
<Sumica> wait Moskau as in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQAKRw6mToA
<Symmetry> warhunterT71: damn. Nobody seems to
<MeteorVenture> yes that
<warhunterT71> lol, i don't know any fanfics that prominently feature rarity
<Sumica> Epic 80's hair and disco beat perhaps?
<Symmetry> there's Simply Rarity, which is wonderful
<MeteorVenture> lol well the costumes are awesome but the music is extremely energetic
<Symmetry> Rarity's New Dress is sort of like (spoilers ahead) Rarity!Cupcakes
<MeteorVenture> at least it is imo
<SuperBrony64> Because it is song of mother Russia?
<Donraj> Or "The Carousel Boutique Expansion Project" in the same vein
<MeteorVenture> in soviet russia song sings you
<warhunterT71> rarity version of cupcakes what?
<warhunterT71> Anyway, do you think I should upload chapter 2 of my fic immediately?
<SuperBrony64> The "Hush Now Quiet Now" video on YouTube frightens me...
<strip0es> g'day from downunder
<Donraj> It's usually best to let writing sit for awhile
<MeteorVenture> ^ which one?
<warhunterT71> yeah...
<SuperBrony64> THAT one
<Symmetry> Donraj: in the horror vein, then?
<SuperBrony64> Type it in YouTube, third video from top
<Symmetry> damn
<Symmetry> I do not like horrorfics or romance fics
<Donraj> Rarity being a sociopath, basically
<warhunterT71> So, did you read my fic?
<SuperBrony64> I know I'll just get in trouble for posting the link here for it >_<
<Symmetry> not yet, warhunterT71, I'm in the middle of a few others
<Donraj> Not yet
<Symmetry> but yours is in a tab
<Donraj> I will in a minute
<MeteorVenture> oh.. i kinda thought it was that one
<warhunterT71> kthanks
<SuperBrony64> But the way the vocals are done is very...calming
<MeteorVenture> i didn't really remember what music that video was to
<SuperBrony64> I don't know who would spend time drawing Fluttershy like that...
<Sumica> kind like the Outlawstar and one peice ones posted today.
<SuperBrony64> I love the One Piece one
<SuperBrony64> Very accurate :P
<MeteorVenture> i started watching it.. looked at the comments and started laughing through it.. am i doing this right?
<Sumica> I never realy got in to One peice but it's still good.
<warhunterT71> It's funny, I got my computer partially wiped soon after I became a brony
<SuperBrony64> It's damn good, especially now.
<Revolver> I remember watching One Piece
<warhunterT71> And now my downloads folder and my history are ALL pony
<SuperBrony64> MeteorVenture: There really is no set way for tackling that video. Just take it for face value…no pun intended :P
<MidgetBrony> ITS ALIVE
<warhunterT71> Wut's alive?
<warhunterT71> This chat?
<MeteorVenture> lols.. also there's some REALLY chill and REALLY depressing hush now quiet now song.. i wanna find it again.. i might have already found it but it's not exactly how i remember it
<SuperBrony64> Haha, that Equestria Girls video is cool
<Dusky> His bot
<SuperBrony64> But very ironic having guys singing it
<Sumica> I see this one making it in to luna's play list
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aznlBiIf9TQ
<strip0es> wow not many on now, from 20 hrs ago it was packed :P
<SuperBrony64> …hoping I'm in the right for using the word 'ironic'
<warhunterT71> o...k
<SuperBrony64> Sumica: That video is full of win
<MeteorVenture> did they ever show spirited away or princess mononoke on brony movie night?
<warhunterT71> Did you guys see the dramatic reading of the MLP fic 'Hardon Lewdad' or whatever it's called on YT?
<Fluttershy`> 8I'm still here by the way. I still have um... kickhammer
<Sumica> it's way better then I could ever do given how quick it was made.
<Donraj> No
<SuperBrony64> kickhammer?
<MeteorVenture> HAMMER HAMMER!
<Sumica> I dont think they do anime for movie nights.
<SuperBrony64> That doesn't sound very threatening...
<strip0es> mm..and i spelt my name wrong..
<MeteorVenture> aww.. but anime has some of the best movies:/
<strip0es> lol
<SuperBrony64> Steamboy
<SuperBrony64> Enough said.
<Sumica> flutter kick eh? no I think I will not let my mind go that way.
<SuperBrony64> Sumica:…Touché
<MeteorVenture> steamboy.. i think i've heard of that
<Fluttershy`> 8well I can't ban, but I can kick at least
<SuperBrony64> MeteorVenture: OMG, Go to YouTube and watch it.
<warhunterT71> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNrM8dXRw8&feature=player_embedded very funny
<SuperBrony64> Haha, it's only two hours long :P
<Sumica> They are good movies i just dont think they will use them. Perhaps on off nights. 8shrug*
<MeteorVenture> hopefully we get grave of the fireflies for the B movie soon (although it's not really B quality)
<SuperBrony64> That was A quality
<MeteorVenture> ya but people FEEL like it's a B movie if you know what i mean
<SuperBrony64> It's A quality, but doesn't have a large fan base
<Vinyl> (╯°□°）╯彡┻━┻
<SuperBrony64> Mainly because it is very depressing
<MeteorVenture> ^ lol
<Vinyl> And stay down.
<Sumica> not the tables, i just fixed taht one.
<MeteorVenture> ohhh steamboy.. is that good? cause the general type of movie it looked like didn't seem that appealing to me
<MeteorVenture> i mean obviously you just redirected me to youtube..
<SuperBrony64> It is one of the highest budget Anime movies to date. Storyline is awesome and the visuals are second to none.
<MeteorVenture> alright checkin'
<SuperBrony64> Plus the soundtrack for it is just pure bliss.
<MeteorVenture> >implying you can find it on youtube
<Sumica> Wouldt mind Appleseed being showen my self.
<SuperBrony64> Yes you can
<SuperBrony64> It's available with ads every 14 minutes in it.
<SuperBrony64> But I think it's available ad-free on Netflix if you are subscribed to that.
<SuperBrony64> I really wanted that to be the A movie this week :/
<MeteorVenture> i'm not.. i will try to find it on some other anime site lol
<MeteorVenture> that uses megavideo.. tables will be flipped and set rightly again in those 72 minutes of wait time
<MeteorVenture> i mean i think it bumped up to 72 now
<MeteorVenture> not sure
<SuperBrony64> That tail whip Fluttershy did to Twilight in the new episode was awesome.
<Fluttershy`> 8darn it... I don't think I can kick people when it's so late at night and there are so few people... walls of text make sense I know it's not spam but my brain sees text and I think 'spam'!
<Symmetry> http://ponyfictionarchive.net/viewstory.php?sid=103 how do I find all the sad fics
<Symmetry> this is ridiculous
<SuperBrony64> You're going to kick one out of the three people here right now?
<MeteorVenture> nah the only place i would watch it is not in the greatest quality
<MeteorVenture> so.. youtube it is
<Silvermane> Fluttershy` there is pretty much no point in policing spam most of the time. Once Prince-Dari gets a chance, he'll probably reset all of the auto-kick macros
<Vinyl> (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
<Vinyl> ┳━┳﻿ﾉ﻿(. _. ﾉ)
<Fluttershy`> 8eh....
<Fluttershy`> 8just trying to do my duty... e-e; and still a bit on high alert after all of that... insanity... yesterday
*Ceiling|Dumori peeks head in
<SuperBrony64> Phonyjack: "Dead or Alive Xtreme 2 is a good game!"
<Sumica> Yeah sorry for the undue stress Fluttershy`
<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy`: Your duty is to just sit back and sort out the wrong from the right. Be passive rather than active.
<Fluttershy`> 8blegh I still have fun talking to you guys of course too
<Fluttershy`> 8I think there's only a couple mods even awake right now... >>
<warhunterT71> lol
<SuperBrony64> Mods just keep order when there are dozens of users chatting at once to help make sure everyone has an equal and fair opportunity to share their opinions.
<Symmetry> no, seriously
<Fluttershy`> 8MMmm true dat
<Symmetry> every fic I click on ff or pfa turns out to be extra sad
<SuperBrony64> When someone abuses that privalege or even posts inappropriate stuff, that's when to fire up the ban cannon.
<Fluttershy`> 8ban cannon lawl xP
<Fluttershy`> 8to the mooooonah!
<SuperBrony64> :P
<MeteorVenture> well youtube has marginally better quality
<SuperBrony64> MeteorVenture: Yeah, and you won't get sent to the moon for watching it :D
<Sumica> OMG Fluttershy` dont let Dis.... SuperBrony64 coroupt you =p
<MeteorVenture> lol >implying
<Fluttershy`> 8rawr
<SuperBrony64> lol, if that's what you call corruption…*rolls eyes*
<Fluttershy`> 8I guess I'm easily corrupted XP I'm so new. I've only been here for 2 bmn
*Silvermane is the only true Discord
<Sumica> yeah but you are popular and omg a gurl
<Silvermane> so is Luna and VioletVanilla
<warhunterT71> I don't mind sad, to be honest
<Silvermane> but then again i'm drunk off tired
<Silvermane> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<warhunterT71> some of them are really good
<Sumica> Yeah they are Silvermane and they too are popular, notice when they talk bronys listen.
<Symmetry> warhunterT71: so far, as a classical musician who you would call, in the words of your fic, a 'professional professional,' this fic is making me perturbed
<SuperBrony64> Time for a mutiny!
<Symmetry> mainly vinyl scratch showing up
<SuperBrony64> :P
<Letti> Well, I'll be going for now, but I'll be back someday.
<Letti> And thanks, SuperBrony64.
<SuperBrony64> Later Letti
<Sumica> Keep that up Fluttershy` and he will come back asking for more.
<Symmetry> written well, though
<Symmetry> good characterization
<Fluttershy`> 8...oh gawd don't even say that! Not with /his/ fetish!
<Symmetry> and yeah, sad can be amazing, but still it's sad
<SuperBrony64> If I was captain of this ship, all I would ask from my crew mates was complete loyalty. If that were the case, they could prance around in their underwear drinking beer for all I care.
<Revolver> He already does, I mean, he is the king of shipping
<SuperBrony64> >_<
<MeteorVenture> btw why is it that people named after chars from the show get more attention and have better chances at being mods?
*Silvermane is the MIGHTY AND MAGNIFICENT SILVERMANE
<MeteorVenture> discuss lol
<Silvermane> MeteorVenture, Luna became Luna during her modship i do believe
<Silvermane> and Fluttershy is... well... Fluttershy. can't top #1 pony
<SuperBrony64> Because people believe that those users are THOSE certain characters.
<Sumica> ....wait what Fetish?
<Fluttershy`> 8>>
<Fluttershy`> 8<<
<Fluttershy`> 8I said nothing
<Fluttershy`> 8no fetish
<Fluttershy`> 8that's naughty
<Fluttershy`> 8spam
<Silvermane> what?
<Fluttershy`> 8spam
<Fluttershy`> 8spam
<Fluttershy`> 8xP
<Silvermane> did i miss fluttershy talking about fetishes again?
<SuperBrony64> Yeah, now I'm interested, what fetish were you talking about ??
<Sumica> Silver, what fetish?
<Revolver> his fetish
<MeteorVenture> superbrony64 that's pretty much what i think.. at least they like to think of the idea of them being from the show
<Fluttershy`> 8wow that was fun
<Silvermane> my fetish?
<SuperBrony64> Well, I think it's pretty cool.
<Silvermane> what about my fetishes?
<SuperBrony64> It's like going to Disneyland and seeing all the characters in costumes.
<Sumica> oh dear dose Fluttershy` look a tad more gray to anyone else?
<SuperBrony64> The best ones are the human characters without the foam suits
<warhunterT71> the bit about her being a professional professional was sort of meant to be from Lyra's perspective
<SuperBrony64> They actually talk like the character they are representing
<SuperBrony64> Sumica: REFERENCES!
<warhunterT71> Ah, it didn't go into italics. I'd better fix that
<Silvermane> if someone is talking about what kink's i have, it involves B and D.
<MeteorVenture> i just feel that it's kind of unfair.. but i can't complain really.. it's just how it is
<Fluttershy`> 8RAWR I am the element of... of...
<Sumica> indeed SuperBrony64, it'as all new to me still >_<
<Revolver> THE KICK HAMMER!
<Fluttershy`> 8oh dear... what's the opposite of kindness?
<Sumica> Element of pms?
<Revolver> bitchiness?
<MeteorVenture> meanness
<Fluttershy`> 8...Sumica >>
<Fluttershy`> 8Revolver!
<Revolver> XD
<Fluttershy`> 8><
<Revolver> I'm sticking with my answer
<Fluttershy`> 8....don't... make me... kick you...
<Sumica> Hulu you disapoint me. Dubbed Bubblegum Crisis.
<MeteorVenture> also no offense to anyone who uses names like that lol
<warhunterT71> Fixed the italics. I though i'd already put them in, oh well, lol
<Symmetry> just a note, though: the instrument Octavia plays seems a lot more like a cello than a double bass; its body is narrower and its body flatter than otherwise
<warhunterT71> I knew people would argue about the instrument, lol
<warhunterT71> I went by this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9CxveZieg
<Sumica> So about this Fetish Silver...
<MeteorVenture> time to learn the science of likeability and implement it for kicks.. then throw it all away and live out my days saying i completed my goals
<warhunterT71> I originally thought it was a cello
<Fluttershy`> 8>>; but... I promised to keep it a secret... Pinkie will pop into a mirror and kill meee!
<Revolver> it's his fetish Sumica
*Gall appears
<MeteorVenture> you guys do know fetish doesn't only mean THAT kind of fetish right?
<MeteorVenture> that's just 1 use for the word
<SuperBrony64> Okay…moving along from this topic…I love this gif: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/59821
<Sumica> yeah I wanted to know what kind of tiki mask he has, why what did you meen?
<Fluttershy`> 8Flutter... Flutter.... something
<SuperBrony64> Alright here we go...
<Symmetry> I maintain cello, after watching that video, based on the looks of the instrument - I've seen cello of many sizes, including larger than normal, and the position in which she plays it is too low for a 4'4'' pony on double bass
<SuperBrony64> Time
<Sumica> Something something darkside, something something complet.
<Fluttershy`> 8FlutterDark?
<Sumica> DarthShy? wait no that sounds like a ship.
<MeteorVenture> fightershy
*GrimGallop appears again
<GrimGallop> Curse you, wireless internet!
<Fluttershy`> 8GRIMMY! HI!
*GrimGallop glomps
<warhunterT71> Meh, I did do a subtle hint at the argument during one of Vinyl's perspective moments. It doesn't really matter. The posture seems right for DB anyway.
*Fluttershy` 8is glomped hehe hi
<SuperBrony64> This comic makes me cry :(
<SuperBrony64> http://krekka01.deviantart.com/#/d4a0k7i
<MeteorVenture> so.. Fightershy it is
<GrimGallop> One of my friends finished watching something earlier and said, "But... now what do I watch?"
<Sumica> meh, too early to be sad to me.
<Donraj> It seems kinda out of character to me that Octavia is so blase about her instrument being damaged.
<Donraj> Well
<GrimGallop> I require a pony image to reply with, implying that she should watch ponies OuO
<Donraj> Not out of character since there is no established character
<SuperBrony64> We watch The Office premiere on September 22nd!
<Donraj> But still
<Donraj> Kinda strange for someone who's presumably a dedicated musician
<warhunterT71> Meh, I wanted it to be funny. I presumed her reaction would happen outside the story, to be honest.
<SuperBrony64> GrimGallop: Use http://www.mylittlefacewhen.com/
<warhunterT71> I'll remember that next time.
<Sumica> I recomend http://pichars.org/store/4414_original_tumblr_ln2xjuRLOy1qb5gkjo1_400.jpg

<Fluttershy`> 8gahhhhh
*Fluttershy` 8dies
*Silvermane hides from GrimGallop. "Also, Fetish as in ritualistic object is hopefully NOT what we were talking about, as I don't have one of those. I just like dominant submissives."
<warhunterT71> Yeah, i kinda failed there.
<GrimGallop> lol @ Sumica
<SuperBrony64> Why, if I ever met one of them "fetish' thingies, I'd laugh at how silly they are.
<GrimGallop> Also, lulz @ Silvermane
*Fluttershy` 8is dead
<Fluttershy`> 8MY DOG IS DEAD! )
<Sumica> i'am looking over my dead dog rover, who i hit with a power mower.
*GrimGallop casts Revenance on Fluttershy`

<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy`: WHAT?!?!
<SuperBrony64> Seriously?!
<Silvermane> (I am not dead, and stop calling me your dog)
<GrimGallop> What's going on now? o.O
<Fluttershy`> 8....no one caught the reference? >> )
<SuperBrony64> Oh damn, I actually thought you were serious for a moment there
<SuperBrony64> :<
<Apokalipse> I0m actually wondering what's going on too...
<SuperBrony64> Although, I don't know why you would chat about something like that...
<GrimGallop> Nope D:
<Sumica> oh cool Miyazaki has done a new movie.

<GrimGallop> Ah. I've seen it. Well, kind of. Parts of it.
<GrimGallop> More like, "My brother was watching it and I was kind of half-paying attention to it while trying to sleep once"
<GrimGallop> Anyways, pretty sure I've got it somewhere around here on DVD XD
<Fluttershy`> 8somepony find part on on youtube or full movie if possible?
<Sumica> all i can find is Rambodash

<MeteorVenture> :/
<Fluttershy`> 8>>
<Fluttershy`> 8<<
<GrimGallop> I forgot that I had this here... I need to save this image~
<Sumica> *rimshot*
<MeteorVenture> listening to moskau once again then on to earthbound prolly
<MeteorVenture> not that i'm leaving lol
<Sumica> .... my god, so in my wanderings I found a 1500page pony thread on nation states.
<MeteorVenture> just lurking more
<GrimGallop> Listening to Moskau? :O
<Sumica> it was started a week ago.
<Fluttershy`> 8GrimGallop: hell yeah
<MeteorVenture> ya that song is.. some word that means it's very good and isn't overused
<Silvermane> underground?
<MeteorVenture> radical
<stripes> g'day from australia!
<MeteorVenture> far out
<GrimGallop> Link me to this radical song. I must see if it's the Moskau I'm thinking of :O
<Sumica> it probably is Grim.
<MeteorVenture> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQAKRw6mToA
<MeteorVenture> the link in the description for the MP3.. i'm listening to that MP3
<MeteorVenture> which is slightly different than the video but just a slight change
<Revolver> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVjGUV4vZ0M
<GrimGallop> Hm. Not the same, but still shiny :P
<FlaschenJoe11> Mornin' Guys
<GrimGallop> FlaschenJoe11!
<MeteorVenture> lol so what moskau were you thinking of?
<GrimGallop> What happened after I left? Anything particularly shiny?
<MeteorVenture> something underground?
<FlaschenJoe11> i left rather early myself
<FlaschenJoe11> still the Dinkypage stream?
<GrimGallop> Actually, I was thinking of either Moskau by Rammstein or Moskva by Lyube.
<GrimGallop> The earliest thing I was able to see when I got back was, "Are we just going to leave Gall here?" followed by something about how you 'need more subtlety than I could handle'
<FlaschenJoe11> Grim, you can't just brute force yourself through everything
<FlaschenJoe11> even though it works quite often
<GrimGallop> I didn't. I went looking for a newspaper stand to find out about anything suspicious going on :P
<FlaschenJoe11> That's a rather smart thing to do
<GrimGallop> To which they said, after noticing I had left while they were talking, "Oh, crap. Did Gall just go off on his own?"
<FlaschenJoe11> Don'T split the party?
<GrimGallop> Which I don't blame them for XD
<GrimGallop> Don't you know, you never split the party~
<GrimGallop> Cleric in the back, keep the fighters healed and hardy~
<GrimGallop> Wizard in the middle, where he can shed some light~
<GrimGallop> And you never let that damn thief out of sight~
<FlaschenJoe11> thank luna you didn't have a killerD,M huh?
<GrimGallop> XD
<MeteorVenture> this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMbyTLRYO7I
<MeteorVenture> cause it's pretty chill
<Fluttershy`> 8grim grim grim grim are you spamming? XD
<GrimGallop> I don't think any DM would kill a player for independently searching for information, unless he deliberately confronted the boss face-to-face, one-on-one
<RobotPinkie> Uh oh!
<GrimGallop> Just reciting lyrics, Fluttershy` T_T
<Fluttershy`> 8OH! RobotPinkie!
<Revolver> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rCv-1wBHa0
<Fluttershy`> 8<3
<Revolver> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVjGUV4vZ0M
<RobotPinkie> Hay Fluttershy` <3
<MeteorVenture> grimgallop do you mean that song? cause i couldn't find anything that exactly said moskva and lyube in the same video.. and there wasn't much to pick from
<MeteorVenture> the one i posted
<RobotPinkie> A lot of people in here today.
<GrimGallop> Yes @ MeteorVenture :P
<MeteorVenture> ok thanks lol:D it's pretty good
*Silvermane glomps RobotPinkie. "I haven't hugged you in a while. Want some shipping?" He licks him on the cheek.
<RobotPinkie> Haha :D
*RobotPinkie hugs Silvermane
<Fluttershy`> 8RobotPinkie: check PM
<GrimGallop> I don't remember how I stumbled across those guys, but they're pretty cool. I think I was looking for a song that Rammstein did a cover of and stumbled across some of their stuff.
<Sumica> Gonna go PTFO have fun with your overnight shipping.
<MeteorVenture> that's cool lol.. i got some pretty obscure stuff i've stumbled across so i know how it is lol
<Sumica> 3,08Outb4kick
<MeteorVenture> ptfo = put the fire out?
<Silvermane> probably meant GTFO
<MeteorVenture> pity the fool oldschool?
<FlaschenJoe11> Now I want a Mr. T Pony
<MeteorVenture> the p is way across the keyboard from g lol
<GrimGallop> Speaking of which, have you created a pony image for your character yet? :D
<RobotPinkie> Oh, it works :P
<Fluttershy`> 8XP

<MeteorVenture> parents too friggin old... i'm running out of ideas that aren't extremely similar to others
*FlaschenJoe11 needs more coffee
<RainBroDash> 10Fluttershy` it's too early in the morning for a rematch, and now I'm scared I'll lose ;3
<RobotPinkie> Rematch in what?
<Revolver> I'm up for a fight
<Fluttershy`> 8RainBroDash: Why? Because I can do this?
<MeteorVenture> ah! you're right! it is early in the morning! no wonder my jokes were not well received

<FlaschenJoe11> you are great pony grim
<RainBroDash> 10Silvermane, Fluttershy` is trying to take you from me again. I doubt my chances now she's a mod :<
<GrimGallop> What's this? RainBroDash is trying to take Silvermane from me? D:
<Silvermane> I have my fullest faith in you, rainbrodash. After all, you kept me through MirthTinker and her filly on filly advances.
<Fluttershy`> 8.....
<Fluttershy`> 8>>
<Fluttershy`> 8<<
<GrimGallop> lol
<Silvermane> not that, I wouldn't mind having YOU as waifu... Fluttershy`... I mean, I'd be lucky to have such a beautiful filly...
<MeteorVenture> i had alot of fun with that pony creator
<Fluttershy`> 8let me pull out my FlutterGuy face
<Fluttershy`> 8>:|
*Silvermane goes and hides in a corner, worried about what will happen if she wins. Especially with that favor...
<RainBroDash> 10MFW I tried to kick GrimGallop in a hilarious way
<stripes> oh well,
<Revolver> Flutterguy voice is epic
*RainBroDash 10doesn't have OP
*stripes leaves a pile of twinkies in the middle of the room for all ponys to nom..
<Fluttershy`> 8RainBroDash wait does that mean I'm more powerful than you right now?!
*GrimGallop cackles deviously as the forces of chaos shape fate in his favor
<stripes> back on soon
<RainBroDash> 10apparently? D:
<GrimGallop> Does that mean RainBroDash is using colors against the rules? >=D
<RainBroDash> 10GrimGallop eeeeenope. >:3
<Fluttershy`> 8eh he's still a mod
<GrimGallop> Dang. The name thing isn't wide enough to see if you have an icon or anything :(
<Fluttershy`> 8it would show on mIRC
<RainBroDash> 10well I don't have ops because I'm lower on the list than some non-OPs, from what I can see?
<Silvermane> Umm...
<Silvermane> does that mean...
<RainBroDash> 10although no idea why flaschenjoe11 is at the top...
<Silvermane> if the fight does occur...
<Fluttershy`> 8FlutterDOMINATION
<Revolver> I WANT IN ON THE FIGHT!
<RainBroDash> 10D: D: D:
<Silvermane> *whimper*
*RainBroDash 10is too weak
<Silvermane> d-don't abuse that favor. remember what it was awarded for. please.
<FlaschenJoe11> I*M THE BEST AROUND!!
<Silvermane> FOAL
<Silvermane> ONLY THE MIGHTY AND MAGNIFICENT SILVERMANE IS BEST AROUND
<Silvermane> /end ego
<GrimGallop> I CHALLENGE YOU!
<Fluttershy`> 8I will kick you again Silvermane <3
*RainBroDash 10apparently can't kick anypony
<Silvermane> *whimper* yes ma'am sorry ma'am won't happen again ma'am
<GrimGallop> For some reason I imagine Silvermane as a paladin.
<Silvermane> >.> it's the name, isn't it
<GrimGallop> Are you a paladin, Silvermane?
<RainBroDash> 10OH THERE WE GO
<GrimGallop> Probably XD
<Revolver> I'm a Barbarian!
<Silvermane> blah, i always played a mage. although cleric is more my style
*RainBroDash 10CACKLES MANIACALLY
*Silvermane hug RainBroDash. "That's mai waifu! ~<3"
<Revolver> I'm a barbarian cause I get to use a heavy flail!
<RainBroDash> 10It feels good to be back

<RobotPinkie> I suck at this
<RainBroDash> 10XD
*GrimGallop can be heard cackling in the distance. The lights go dark for a second, and GrimGallop stands before you when they return.
<RobotPinkie> I need some breakfast and coffee
<Silvermane> hrmm
<Fluttershy`> 8RainBroDash... >>
<RainBroDash> 10:3
<Revolver> XD
<GrimGallop> I've been know to play wizards, sorcerers, and clerics, but I still say bards are the most fun just because... well, they're freaking bards.
*Silvermane goes and hides in the corner. "At least I know my ass is safe either way...."
<Revolver> I get to use intimidate!
<RobotPinkie> 06 I can do this, I guess...
<RobotPinkie> But it's not allowed
<FlaschenJoe11> You Spoony Bard
<RainBroDash> 10Robotpinkie did you have your trial already?
<Fluttershy`> 8>3>
<warhunterT71> Anypony still aliiiiive?
*RainBroDash 10has been too busy with Uni stuff to know what's going on
<GrimGallop> Spoony bard indeed. So have you created a pony image for yourself yet? :D
<RobotPinkie> 06,15 I need a manual and a sammich, stat!
*RainBroDash 10fucking loves those colours
*GrimGallop fetches a sandwich
<Revolver> SANDVICH!

<RainBroDash> 10yeah robotpinkie
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Guess I'll keep it :P
<RainBroDash> 10:D:D
<GrimGallop> I'll take that as a "No, and this pony generator is driving me to insanity."
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Now to figure out how to put this in a script...
<Fluttershy`> 8ho ho ho I have an idea
*RainBroDash 10can't help you, since he cba with 'proper' irc and just uses mibbit like a baws
<RainBroDash> 10my internet is realllllyyy slow today
<RobotPinkie> can't be arsed is just another word for nothing left to lose
<RainBroDash> 10:<
<RobotPinkie> 06,15No wait, that was "Freedom"
*GrimGallop uses mibbit like a baws as well
*Silvermane hugs RainBrodash. "How are you waifu?"
<GrimGallop> Silvermane's created a pony image for himself, right?
<RainBroDash> 10I'm okay, really tired though ;___;
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Can't use background colors in mibbit, though...
<Silvermane> I know what you mean, it's 6 am here
*RainBroDash 10doesn't need to, RobotPinkie. trololo
<Revolver> 5 am here
<MeteorVenture> when am i gonna see a pokemon/gurren lagann (think: missingno) crossover?
<RainBroDash> 10http://www.speedtest.net/result/1488945560.png WOOHOO
<RainBroDash> 10look how good my internet is today
<RobotPinkie> 06,15/me cries... or something.
<Revolver> XD
<Revolver> great internet RBD
<RainBroDash> 10almost beats my personal best: http://www.speedtest.net/result/1450460274.png
<Revolver> XD
<GrimGallop> Kind of makes me wonder how my internet is. All I really care about is that YouTube videos load slightly faster than they play :P
<RainBroDash> 10mine don't..
<MeteorVenture> we can beat that.. our internet went from 10 mbps to around 100X less or so and did that over and over.. depending on when we started a download it could go fast or really slow
<MeteorVenture> glitchy internet is best internet
<Revolver> http://www.speedtest.net/result/1488947961.png
<Revolver> That was mine just now
<MeteorVenture> oh and when we called the people to figure out the problem.. we only got 10's bwahahaha
<RainBroDash> 10;_;
<Revolver> you jelly RBD?
<MeteorVenture> you're in the 1/3 percentile
<RainBroDash> 10revolver I jelly.
*Donraj yawns
<warhunterT71> me niether.
<GrimGallop> http://www.speedtest.net/result/1488949822.png
<RainBroDash> 10I'm 3 and 1/2 minutes into a video on youtube that I've been watching in 360p for almost 10 minutes now
<RainBroDash> 10y u no buffer
<Revolver> XD
<GrimGallop> lol
<MeteorVenture> http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/305764_250082488367241_219823134726510_678332_1360205136_n.jpg
<Revolver> dat ad
*RainBroDash 10is going afk to watch an episode of k-on to let this 10 minute video buffer
<GrimGallop> lol
<Turgle> du-du-du-duuuu
<FlaschenJoe11> MAGNETO!
<Fluttershy`> 8 hey RobotPinkie you using mIRC then?
<RobotPinkie> Nope, using XChat.
<MeteorVenture> magneato *snap*
<Turgle> Hi RP
<Fluttershy`> 8 I think I want to try that... is it free?
<Turgle> yep
<RobotPinkie> Hey Turgle
<Turgle> http://xchat.org/windows/
<Turgle> uhm wait, xchat for windows is not free?
<Revolver> guess not
<Turgle> but it's free for linux
<Turgle> ._.
<RobotPinkie> A bit lagged here, modifying a Tcl script.
<Turgle> whatever
<Revolver> its cause linux has an x in it
<Turgle> :O
<RobotPinkie> 06,15So... Lets see here...
*RobotPinkie is now in color.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Nice stuff.
<maidnaut> asdf
<maidnaut> hi
*RainBroDash 10cheers at RobotPinkie
<warhunterT71> hello
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I still need breakfast, though... :P
*GrimGallop robs RobotPinkie of her colors
<GrimGallop> Wait, robots don't have gender, do they?
<MeteorVenture> grim this moskva music somehow kinda reminds me of jet set music
<RobotPinkie> 06,15No, though I'm guessing you should call me a "he" anyway. :P
<MeteorVenture> more specifically jet set radio future though probably cause that's all i've played of that series
<Dumori> It's iffy
<Dumori> Objects tend to be female
<Dumori> People male
<Dumori> In english
<Dumori> The assumed gender is any person is male unless known other wise.
<Dumori> But a robot could be both
<Dumori> It is safe though
<RobotPinkie> 06,15How sexist of you :P
<Turgle> :D
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<Dumori> English is a gendered language.
<GrimGallop> I assume people's genders online based on the character they've named themselves after (if applicable), unless otherwise specified :P
<Dumori> Not heavily but it still has grammatical gender
<Dumori> Blond and blonde
<RobotPinkie> 06,15So if French, but since they think vaginas are male, I tend to not listen to them...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15*so is
<Turgle> XD
<FlaschenJoe11> Nice
<Dumori> Male female forms of the same word.
<Dumori> Yeah grammatical gender tends to lack "logic"
<GrimGallop> Anyways, I'm going to fall asleep watching some Star Trek in the other room. Hopefully I get through the episode I fell asleep during yesterday... I want to know what the heck is going on :P
<MeteorVenture> i believe that it's actually correct to use he and such as the default
<Dumori> It is no neutral gender in English.
<MeteorVenture> that's what i heard anyway.. until feminism kicked in and we can't do that anymore cause it's sexist somehow
<Dumori> I still do it and would even if female
<BlacklightShining> oh, this is IRC?
<MeteorVenture> ya i know lol.. i do too but i do change things up sometimes
<Dumori> Until English loses gender in that way I shall
<warhunterT71> I think so
<RobotPinkie> 06,15morning, WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> Good morning RobotPinkie
<BlacklightShining> irc.ponychat.net?
<Dumori> And that won't happen till I'm long dead
<Dumori> Oh hia WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> How did you manage yesterday?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, I saw the premiere, but I missed a bit of S1 marathon
<MeteorVenture> i hope it never happens.. it'd be more embarrassing to say that wrong than it would to have a 50/50 chance of being right
<MeteorVenture> cause that way it's a 100% chance of being wrong
<Turgle> Hi WhatPayne !
<MeteorVenture> it only shows that you really don't know lol
<Dumori> I think arabic lacks gender past pure nouns.
<Dumori> Urdu might as well.
<MeteorVenture> we could use "it" but that's just not right
<Dumori> Not 100%
<WhatPayne> Did you sleep during the S1 marathon?
<`Fluttershy> RobotPinkie, how do you do colors on xchat? D:
<Dumori> With magic
<Crossbow70> When the episode 2 come?
<Turgle> ^
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Nah, got called away in an emergency, kinda
<RobotPinkie> 06,15or well I had a 1 episode nap, before :P
<Crossbow70> When come the new episode\
<MeteorVenture> i slept through it
<WhatPayne> Yeah I had to take nap too
<GrimGallop> ...wow, it seems I've sparked a much larger discussion that I expected by complete accident (?)
<Dumori> Episode 2? Next Saturday Crossbow70
<Turgle> :D
<Dumori> GrimGallop aprently so
<Crossbow70> Tknx
<MeteorVenture> i really just kinda felt like latching onto what you said and saying what i wanted to say since i had a chance lol
<Dumori> Lol
*GrimGallop vanishes in his usual melodramatic fashion of being swallowed by darkness and swearing to return as he departs. Blah blah blah~
<MeteorVenture> sometimes the things you want to say are the things that you never get a solid chance to say.. not appropriately anyway
<MeteorVenture> have grim will travel
<Dumori> You could just say them on whim
<Dumori> And confuse people.
<MeteorVenture> i do that too sometimes depending on what it's about.. i like serious discussions but most people avoid them and i understand why
<Dumori> They can cause issues when people you know disagree.
<MeteorVenture> i avoid discussing serious things with seriously misguided people
<MeteorVenture> which make up alot of the internet
<Dumori> Hehe
<MeteorVenture> any alot of the internet will agree LOL
<Dumori> Yup
<RobotPinkie> 06,15oh... lol sent the message to the wrong name `Fluttershy
<MeteorVenture> well i've never actually seen trouble caused by a serious discussion that i've gotten into.. at least as far as i can remember
<Dumori> I can't type that on here lack the input
<Dumori> :-* wonder who can render that....
<MeteorVenture> the trouble starts when people be hateful
<MeteorVenture> start being* lol
<Dumori> I could make my name impissable to enter for most of you I think
<WhatPayne> Say where did that Magneto thing originated from?
<Dumori> Some live stream. Think it was the brony pod cast one
<Dumori> They did a s1 marathon
<MeteorVenture> and of course a decent few people decided to start being hateful to me in these serious discussions but since i wasn't being hateful back.. nothing happened and it was all fine and i left them to their hatred and that's that.. i don't hang around people like that anyway
<Dumori> And it had an annoying mageto add during gala
<WhatPayne> So RobotPinkie what did you think of the new ep?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I thought it was pretty darn amazing, WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> It really was...
<MeteorVenture> you can see a video of it on youtbue
<MeteorVenture> youtube*
<MeteorVenture> it's pretty funny that that same episode = gyrobowl too
<MeteorVenture> the gala makes every ad more interesting
<WhatPayne> Say RobotPinkie, what's up with the colours?
<Dumori> Mods are alseep I think
<MeteorVenture> post tardis
<MeteorVenture> eh.. back to lurk mode
<Dumori> Back to trying to sleep
<Dumori> But you know will be weird just like last night. Stupid wacky too real seeming dreams.
<Dumori> Really feels like I'm in a tv show written and directed by pinkie pie
<RobotPinkie> 06,15My colors are very pretty, aren't they? :P
<Dumori> Mine are better
<WhatPayne> I support whites only!
<WhatPayne> Wait...
<WhatPayne> That came out wrong
<Dumori> Kick!
<Dumori> X3
<RobotPinkie> 06,15And no, mods aren't asleep, non-mods get auto-kicked when using colors.
<Dumori> Oh you mod now?
<WhatPayne> ^
<Dumori> Or circumventing script? *slyface*
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, no, the former.
<RainBroDash> 10Slyfaces don't get past RBD
*RainBroDash 10flexes
<Dumori> C.garts
<Dumori> Wait why do I always end up in #BronySate
<Dumori> I don't join it
<MeteorVenture> what did the garbage picker say to the paper that flew away?
<Dumori> I just appear in in it...
<MeteorVenture> come back here you piece of white trash
<MeteorVenture> :|
<Dumori> Yeah you made anon leave in terror
<Dumori> Bad MeteorVenture
<RobotPinkie> 06,15and yeah I'm pretty sure the mods would ban me if I tried to circumvent the color restrictions
<RainBroDash> 10;3
<MeteorVenture> lol poor anon
<MeteorVenture> i'm white btw so it's all ok right guise?... guys?
*RainBroDash 10is teal IRL
<Dumori> Dari banned me yesterday....
<MeteorVenture> even if i was black to begin with i've been in this basement far too long
<MeteorVenture> jk though.. i don't have a basement!
<RainBroDash> 10lolol dumori, what for? XD
<Dumori> My client whent funny
<Dumori> I managed to join every open room on the irc sever
<Dumori> But the mane 6 kick if you are in more than one
<Dumori> And my auto join is fast
<RainBroDash> 10oh right
<Dumori> The result was epic kick spam
<RainBroDash> 10do ho ho
<Dumori> In at least 6 channels.
<Dumori> Then after the 10 min ban in said rooms it auto joined just one again for no reason.
<Dumori> Dumb Client
<MeteorVenture> guys i even had to look up what the name for a garbage picker was for that joke back there
<RainBroDash> 10LASEFNHflblabfabflABSF;LSAF
<RainBroDash> 10I can't even watch low quality youtube videos
<RainBroDash> 10internet, fix thineself!
<MeteorVenture> they're not THAT bad
<MeteorVenture> dang.. what keeps me from actually going into lurk mode?
<Dumori> Zecora
<Dumori> She enchanted the chat
<Dumori> To be enchanting.
<MeteorVenture> that's just evil
<Dumori> Ok I just landed new bedding. Damn this pillow is soft!
<Dumori> Launded
<MeteorVenture> stop teasing me.. i already have to stay up for a while longer while tired
<Dumori> Landed makes sense but is wrong!
<Dumori> Muhahaha
<MeteorVenture> and then even my flat pillow will feel great
<MeteorVenture> actually i've not really been one for soft pillows.. if it's too soft it's impossible to get to sleep
<MeteorVenture> sleeping on a rock.. now that will get you to sleep
<FlaschenJoe11> Discord is Trolling
<FlaschenJoe11> EQD
<Fluttershy`> rar
<RainBroDash> 10moo
<MeteorVenture> you know when you're tired in the morning and can't get back to sleep cause you can't find anything different to sleep on? well i think that i probably could get back to sleep if i had something hard to sleep on.. like the ground
<Dumori> It's not squishy soft but just soft
<MeteorVenture> squishy? what? lol
<MeteorVenture> i dunno what that even means for a pillow
<MeteorVenture> unless it was filled with gel or something
<MeteorVenture> and made of rubber
<MeteorVenture> sounds like a legit pillow that i would never want to use
<Dumori> Lol
<Dumori> As ints not much more than flat
<MeteorVenture> alright lol
<Dumori> Just feels stupidly soft
<Dumori> But probable way too much so
<Dumori> Can see my self just rubbing my face on it and not sleeping
<MeteorVenture> i'm gonna be going to sleep and my pillow is just going to start singing "i'm flat! i'm flat" and such
<Dumori> X3
<MeteorVenture> then i realize i have weird al's pillow
<Dumori> Get a blue pillow then it can sing a cover.
<MeteorVenture> a blues pillow lol
<Dumori> And yeah bad pun
<MeteorVenture> actually my pillow case is blue
<Dumori> That or singing I'm blue
<MeteorVenture> we're off squadalee squadalah
<MeteorVenture> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYwkKynbxqo
*ceiling|Dumori like a spider to the ceiling doth Dumori go
*FlaschenJoe11 is scared of ceiling beings
<MeteorVenture> then suddenly we stand still too long and dumori drops down and grabs us
<ceiling|Dumori> Like a Zelda mob
<MeteorVenture> ^ exactly
<ceiling|Dumori> I'll dump you at the start of the dungeon one heart less
<RustedDroneAkaPtard> Morning comrades
<ceiling|Dumori> I have a mental image of my pegaus OC with spider legs now
*MeteorVenture would see your shadow and dodge
<ceiling|Dumori> Discord did it!
<ceiling|Dumori> Oh hia aprotrate music.
<ceiling|Dumori> To the Moon from the Majora's Mask sound track
<ceiling|Dumori> Both creepy and from Zelda
<MeteorVenture> link must have lived in soviet russia.. cause.. moon fly to you
<ceiling|Dumori> Moon banished to the earth
<MeteorVenture> seriously zelda was such an awesome RPG
<ceiling|Dumori> Ja
<ceiling|Dumori> Majora's mask is one of my fav child hood games
<ceiling|Dumori> Sooooo awesome
<MeteorVenture> ocarina of time and majora's mask.. also a link to the past.. i don't think i played any others though
<ceiling|Dumori> Played the GC ones they ok-good
<ceiling|Dumori> But not as good as MM
<ceiling|Dumori> OoT was good MM was better
<MeteorVenture> i got majora's mask later but i still found it to be just as awesome as ocarina of time.. i was surprised cause i expected it to be worse as sequels usually are
<ceiling|Dumori> Same I found it better
<ceiling|Dumori> I enjoyed the creepy as FUCK factor
<MeteorVenture> oh heck ya
<ceiling|Dumori> I mean wearing people's souls to turn it to them
<ceiling|Dumori> That causes pain
<ceiling|Dumori> To do
<MeteorVenture> also getting all the masks was fun.. especially when someone already told you that you need a walkthrough to do it and you just accept it as a challenge
<ceiling|Dumori> Lol
<ceiling|Dumori> I did the do every thing in the 144 min challenge.
<MeteorVenture> i'm not familiar with that challenge
<ceiling|Dumori> After beating the game
<ceiling|Dumori> You can play it endlessly
<ceiling|Dumori> Well the challenge is to do ever side quest ect on the 144 mins you get
<ceiling|Dumori> Running at 1/2 speed
<MeteorVenture> how do you run at 1/2 speed?
<ceiling|Dumori> One of the songs
<ceiling|Dumori> You are told/hinted at
<MeteorVenture> i didn't think you actually slowed down.. i must've forgot something
<ceiling|Dumori> No but the in game time does
<MeteorVenture> ya sure.. so wouldn't you be going 2X the speed?
<MeteorVenture> oh nm
<MeteorVenture> i see what you mean i think
<ceiling|Dumori> Not quite you just get longer
<MeteorVenture> well do that challenge on double speed and then come talk to me hahahaah
<ceiling|Dumori> Well you can just fit in every side quest in the game and do the bosses and finarly
<ceiling|Dumori> Is impossible
<ceiling|Dumori> Its impossible with just 72 mins
<MeteorVenture> i bet you could do it with TAS or something
<Apokalipse> msg nickserv identify majjam
<MeteorVenture> well aside from cutscenes
<ceiling|Dumori> Not the same you are taught that song to do that it's the true ending of the game but I don't think you get any reall changes
<MeteorVenture> how about just speeding up the emulator X4 on half speed? that's doable lololol
<ceiling|Dumori> Lol
<ceiling|Dumori> Speed hack plus slow ingame time
<ceiling|Dumori> Lol
<MeteorVenture> wait.. are you spoiling things for a game i already thought i completed?
<ceiling|Dumori> Sorry
<MeteorVenture> that really sucks
<MeteorVenture> also wtf whoever made majora's mask?
<ceiling|Dumori> Other wise you save the world and people still get abducted, killed, have unfinished bisness.
<ceiling|Dumori> No idea now
<ceiling|Dumori> I did most of my playing it years ago
<MeteorVenture> oh i see.. i understand now
<pinkiepie> hi
<MeteorVenture> ya i always thought about that.. funny that they implement it
<pinkiepie> :(
<ceiling|Dumori> They made mm so you could just do it all
<pinkiepie> :*(
<pinkiepie> :'(
<ceiling|Dumori> Hi pinkiepie
<pinkiepie> hi :D
<MeteorVenture> heya pinkiepie
<pinkiepie> hi
<ceiling|Dumori> Don't be so melodramatic.
<mib_688afy> Hi all!
<pinkiepie> haha ye i oust kiding a litle bit :)
<ceiling|Dumori> ;)
<MeteorVenture> i'm ticked cause this jerk dumori told me massive spoilers
<MeteorVenture> about a game i already thought i beat
<MeteorVenture> completely
<ceiling|Dumori> Bah
<MeteorVenture> lols
<pinkiepie> _D
<pinkiepie> :D
<pinkiepie> have to go se ya
<MeteorVenture> alright take care
<ceiling|Dumori> Just told you that unless you do all the quests in the 3 days they aren't done.
<ceiling|Dumori> And that's it
<ceiling|Dumori> It's a bitch to do though
<ceiling|Dumori> As if you slip up you have to start all over...
<MeteorVenture> well of course
<ceiling|Dumori> And you need to juggle time slot
<ceiling|Dumori> ceiling|Dumori is meant to be my AFK name...
<RustedDroneAkaPtard> "Pinkie Pie, who appears mostly talentless but who is actually a demon of chaos who can alter reality itself merely through force of will."
<ceiling|Dumori> Why am I still active
<MeteorVenture> it's stupidly slow but you got to work stupidly fast? that's something
<MeteorVenture> cause i stood still and you came back
<ceiling|Dumori> It's normal speed but each game day is twice as long so you can do more
<MeteorVenture> well ya i know
<MeteorVenture> but i mean the wait time is so long
<MeteorVenture> for all the time to be done
<MeteorVenture> but if anyone can do it i can too lol
<ceiling|Dumori> You need to warp around slot
<ceiling|Dumori> A lot
<ceiling|Dumori> Ie start x do y go back to x
<MeteorVenture> well i'll plan that out myself
<MeteorVenture> i don't want a walkthrough
<ceiling|Dumori> Bah the quest log is good for that
<ceiling|Dumori> Also you need to fit the bosses in.
<MeteorVenture> ya i know
<ceiling|Dumori> But deity mask = EASY as pie
<MeteorVenture> :| ya
<ceiling|Dumori> You have to do the quests the cheap ways if you can
<MeteorVenture> obviously lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ahhh, finally some food. <3
<ceiling|Dumori> I wonder if any pony has recorded said run
<MeteorVenture> i've been around games enough to know what it's probably like
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Talking speed runs?
<MeteorVenture> i just wish i had a controller that i could probably do said challenge with.. it's looking like i'm gonna need to use an emulator if that's even a valid option
<MeteorVenture> sort of.. it basically is but it's a challenge to do lots of stuff in a short amount of time
<MeteorVenture> a specific set amount of time
<MeteorVenture> which is very fast apparently
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Hmmm, in what game?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I've tried to do a Super Metroid speed run, but I couldn't get closer than 20 minutes to the record. :P
<MeteorVenture> majora's mask
<MeteorVenture> glad i got to play super metroid as a kid.. that game has alot to teach about the importance of atmosphere
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah. It taught me a lot about gameplay, also. Super Metroid is a work of platforming art.
<MeteorVenture> ya it was a SUPER great game
<MeteorVenture> no pun intended
<ceiling|Dumori> It's the do everything in the 3 days challenge
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It's like they put the skill-based short cuts in there on purpose, too.
<ceiling|Dumori> All the side quests and the main quest. You have to use the reversed song of time (for parts at least)
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ahhh, I've heard about that.
<ceiling|Dumori> It's my ultimate goal withy next play though
<ceiling|Dumori> GC emulated version though as my n64 is now long dead
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I don't have my N64 anymore, kinda regret getting rid of it.
<ceiling|Dumori> I have it I think
<ceiling|Dumori> It's just dead
<MeteorVenture> my nes still works though
<MeteorVenture> lol
<MeteorVenture> kinda
<ceiling|Dumori> The poor thing burnt out
<RobotPinkie> 06,15N64 just had unfortunately weak controllers.
<ceiling|Dumori> Think we had a powersurge and it blow it
<MeteorVenture> my n64 works fine though i think.. it's just the poor controllers that are not perfect
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Every single one of them got problems with the analog stick, it was getting annoying. :P
<ceiling|Dumori> Yeah our n64 died 08-09
<ceiling|Dumori> And it was used reguarly up till then
<ceiling|Dumori> Those damn rare ware games
<ceiling|Dumori> So so much fun
<MeteorVenture> i never actually owned a snes.. i played it at my sisters house lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh yeah, Jet Force Gemini
<ceiling|Dumori> Still has his mega drive
<MeteorVenture> but i still got to play zelda a link to the past, super metroid and super mario world
<Pontang> RustedDrone: Pinkie Pie is the true god of Equestria.
<Pontang> =s
<MeteorVenture> and a little of mario paint.. that bug swatting game was srs bsns
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I wish I had the Zelda collection for GC
<RustedDrone> Agreed
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I only have the OoT/Master's Quest disc
<Pontang> She's basically Haruhi Suzumiya. =s
<ceiling|Dumori> Ah
<Pontang> This is just her reality.
<ceiling|Dumori> I have the whole set
<ceiling|Dumori> Was well worth keeping
<MeteorVenture> quit bragging
<MeteorVenture> :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, it wasn't released in stores here, though
<MeteorVenture> i'm jk though
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You had to be a Club Nintendo member and enter some kind of lottery
<ceiling|Dumori> Ah lame
<ceiling|Dumori> Pal got it with the GC at one point
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Eh, eventually I'll find one :P
<ceiling|Dumori> With double dash.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh okay... well I already had a GC, so that wouldn't have helped much
<ceiling|Dumori> Totally the mario cart game was the add on there
<RustedDrone> Haruhi Suzumiya?
<RustedDrone> hmmm brb google
<RobotPinkie> 06,15but then I guess it was available in stores here, since I'm in PAL territory :P
<ceiling|Dumori> And the 6 Zelda games one disc the reall selling point
<ceiling|Dumori> X3
<MeteorVenture> too bad i don't have some of these golden oldies http://www.gadgetlite.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NES-cartridge-USB-external-hdd-450x298.jpg
<ceiling|Dumori> I had dia katana first ed cart printing
<ceiling|Dumori> Sold it for a fuck tonne
<MeteorVenture> i had to make a pun lol
<RustedDrone> That storyline sounds quite cool o_o
<ceiling|Dumori> :)
<ceiling|Dumori> Such a collectable cart
<ceiling|Dumori> For some reason
<ceiling|Dumori> I mean it's was a SHIT game
<MeteorVenture> a cartridge or 2 of mine had a hole in it.. still worked lol
<MeteorVenture> a sizeable hole at that
<Pontang> =s
<ceiling|Dumori> Lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh wow, what heresy, destroying a Zelda cartridge :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I didn't like Zelda 2
<MeteorVenture> nah it was like snake rattle 'n roll or something
<MeteorVenture> we didn't mean to destroy it lol
<MeteorVenture> also it still played so eh
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Dammit, now I feel like playing Ocarina of Time :(
<MeteorVenture> play snake rattle 'n roll and a winner can be you
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Time to get the GC out from the closet.
<MeteorVenture> nah it's a nes game
<MeteorVenture> unless.. you're saying you don't want to be a winner
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I mean for me, to play some Zelda :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15...actually I think I'd rather play Wind Waker
<MeteorVenture> this can't be!
<MeteorVenture> i think i'd rather play snake waker
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I think I'd rather play Wind Eater
<MeteorVenture> >.>..... >.>...... <.<......
<MeteorVenture> i think i'd rather play wind shielder
<ceiling|Dumori> MetalGear Zelda: Wind Eater
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'd play that.
<ceiling|Dumori> Or The Legend of MetalGear
<ceiling|Dumori> Not sure
<ceiling|Dumori> Both are cool names
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I like Metal Gear Zelda, because it implies Zelda is the new Metal Gear.
<ceiling|Dumori> Occarina of libity
<ceiling|Dumori> X3
<RobotPinkie> 06,15but yeah, going AFK a bit, I haven't played any Zelda in a long time...
<MeteorVenture> the legend of metal gear: a winner is you
<MeteorVenture> actually
<MeteorVenture> the legend of metal gear: a windwaker is you
<MeteorVenture> the legend of simulators: the horrible of seasons

<ceiling|Dumori> For mibbit
<Cynder7> 6*hugs*
<Cynder7> 6^^
<ceiling|Dumori> Bar saying if you can use an IRC client do it
<Abbey1053> 14how are you? :3
<Luna> 07,1 it was just a shame... what i'm most upset about was.. we had a test-stream before and only 200 ponies showed up... we had fridaynight stream and 1200+ ponies showed up
<Cynder7> 6Good,you? ^^
<DashWithRainbows> test stream? when was that?
<Abbey1053> 14I'm fine
<Luna> 07,1 a stream to test stability and the likes
<Fluttershy`> 12gah... the whole thing with the s2 premiere was a nightmare ;___;
<Cynder7> 6Btw,how come it shows you as away even though you just spoke? I noticed it with DSD yesterday too..
<ceiling|Dumori> Yeah
<ceiling|Dumori> So many people in chat
<MeteorVenture> i think you mean a learning experience!
<DashWithRainbows> i was worried i wouldnt be anle to watch season 2 live
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Was the test stream announced on EqD?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm pretty sure it was.
<Luna> 07,1 yep
<Abbey1053> 14o.O
<Abbey1053> 14That's weird
<ceiling|Dumori> Bmn stream was on MLP wiki too
<Dermathil> hello everybrony!!!
<Cynder7> 6Yeah.
<DashOrCrash> I remember the premier being laggy at first, but it got better later.
<ceiling|Dumori> Yeah
<DashOrCrash> Maybe that was only in the Fluttershy room...
<ceiling|Dumori> It was better than the alts after it delagged
<Cynder7> 6I can't put that I'm away o.o
<Dermathil> how is everybrony today?
<Fluttershy`> 12Luna yfw my original plan was to have yellow text with a pink background >>
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, it didn't take that long for it to get sorted out, and the repeat was very nice.
<Luna> 07,1 the fluttershy room was great :)
<ceiling|Dumori> Sleepy and a tree of the pine type
<Fluttershy`> 12<3 Oh yes. Fluttershy room was awesome
<Dermathil> >mfw RobotPinkie is using color and Prince-dari is there
<DashWithRainbows> @Fluttershy` that would be so hard to read!
<Dermathil> WAT
<Dermathil> RP is Mod?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ohay Dermathil
<Luna> 07,1 that's because he's a mod
<Luna> 07,1 and so is flutter ;)
<Dermathil> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<DashOrCrash> ...Even though we had to watch fluttershy's brain get hacked
<Cynder7> 6Anyways.. o.o
*ceiling|Dumori isn't a mod :(
<DashWithRainbows> atleast she was capable of actually not falling for discords trap
*Dermathil has to start thinking of sending another application in.
<Fluttershy`> 12lol @ Dermathil
<DashWithRainbows> he had to cheat...
*ceiling|Dumori blames his gmail being retarded
<Dermathil> (1st interview was a no)
<Cynder7> 6Btw,I made a new SCS with all the thus from yesterday :3
<ceiling|Dumori> I applied in august x3
<MantisToboggan> i like how discord didn't actually give a shit about the game
<Fluttershy`> 12I'm not sure how I became a mod
<DashOrCrash> Discord and Q have so much in common...
<Fluttershy`> 12o-o
<MantisToboggan> just did whatever he wanted anyway
<ceiling|Dumori> Only found the reply yesterday.
<Fluttershy`> 12I'm like... the weirdest person... to be a mod
<DashOrCrash> they both love "games"
<DashOrCrash> and both cheat anyways
<MantisToboggan> he didn't corrupt dash either
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I don't think so, Fluttershy`.
<MantisToboggan> just had her pick between two loyalities
<DashOrCrash> he did corrupt her by showing her the image of cloudsdale
<MantisToboggan> so she's just fucking with them (or just twilight) and the game was nothing to him
<Fluttershy`> 12I was so sure I was going to fail during so hard XP
<Fluttershy`> 12fail so hard*
<Fluttershy`> 12during stuff
<Fluttershy`> 12><
<Dermathil> My theory is they take the weird persons as mod. Why? I wasn't taken
<MantisToboggan> no she was still loyal
<MantisToboggan> just picked the other one
<MeteorVenture> when i first saw the design of discord i was.. something.. i wouldn't say disappointed.. maybe worried in a way.. anyway it was totally not what i expected but now it's awesome
<Dermathil> well, not weird per se, but more unusual individuals.
<MantisToboggan> she didn't become disloyal technically
<MeteorVenture> better than expected actually
<RobotPinkie> 06,15>Dermathil not being weird
<Dermathil> that's what I JUST said RP
<Dermathil> I meant unusual
<DashOrCrash> If all the wierd people were mods, every brony who ever lived would be one.
<Fluttershy`> 12HOW IS MY TEXT? IS IT OKAY TO SEE?
<Orange_Peel> I hope the next episode continues the awesomeness of this one... see you on Saturday ;)
<Apokalipse> ohai bronystate
*Luna nods
<Fluttershy`> 12DOES IT STAND OUT ETC?
<ceiling|Dumori> Is BLU
<Dermathil> DashOrCrash: that would be if the mods weren't unusual bronies
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, it's easy to see, Fluttershy`
<DashWithRainbows> is noticable...
*Dermathil squints his eyes to read.
<Fluttershy`> 12RobotPinkie: my name in highlight is hard to see on mibbit XP
<ceiling|Dumori> Mibbit is meh
<ceiling|Dumori> Even pidgin is better irc client.
<Fluttershy`> 12Mibbit is better than some
<DashOrCrash> I use Colloquy for IRC
<MantisToboggan> can't see text
<MantisToboggan> black background
<DashOrCrash> because I'm on a mac =D
<ceiling|Dumori> Lol
<MeteorVenture> hey mac what you in for?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh yeah, the light background
<Fluttershy`> 12I would use light blue if Silver didn't already have it ;___; I love light green as well
<Fluttershy`> 12light green is my fave
<ceiling|Dumori> Colloquy is on my phone
<MantisToboggan> colour text on IRC is soo 1999
<MantisToboggan> anyway
<MantisToboggan> ;/
<Luna> 07,1 lol
<ceiling|Dumori> X3
<Apokalipse> lol
<ceiling|Dumori> Is needed fir modding. I guess
<MantisToboggan> no it's not
<MantisToboggan> they have the @
<Dermathil> MantisToboggan, not in every client.
<MantisToboggan> but it's not like this channel is srs business so whatever. just kinda annoying imo
<ceiling|Dumori> On mibbit with 599 plus
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It's just so it's easy to see warning messages and important things from mods.
<Luna> 07,1 nope.. our new mods don't have a @
<ceiling|Dumori> It is
<Dermathil> I don't see the @ in Mibbit, for example.
<Luna> 07,1 nor a star
<Apokalipse> This is the first time I've heard of an @
<Fluttershy`> 12Luna: me and RP just have kick powers
<Fluttershy`> 12Dari just gave us kick powers for nao ;__; no hop or op
<Luna> 07,1 that's cause this server does not allow hops
<Fluttershy`> 12oh dear
<Luna> 07,1 just do your best ;)
*Dermathil still thinks that he deserves moar than just mere viewer due to being around for so long.....
<Fluttershy`> 12;___;
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ah okay.
<ceiling|Dumori> Hops are fun
<ceiling|Dumori> They make good beer
<Abbey1053> 14:O
<DashOrCrash> XD
<Abbey1053> 14can I see it?
<Dermathil> xD
<Fluttershy`> 12hahaha
<Fluttershy`> 12ha
<Fluttershy`> 12ha
<Fluttershy`> 12ha

<Fluttershy`> 12I was scared to type any more >>
<ceiling|Dumori> Lakskskakakx
<ceiling|Dumori> Sjahdgagshd
<ceiling|Dumori> Thats real spam
<DashOrCrash> well, I'm gonna get coffee
<DashOrCrash> but afterwords...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah don't make me break my cannon out, Fluttershy` :P
*DashWithRainbows does not to drink your mere coffee
<DashOrCrash> should I play Minecraft or Civ 5?
<Apokalipse> I'd need coffee too. I'm burned out after the marathon and the streaming yesterday
<Fluttershy`> 12RobotPinkie: I call it a kick hammer
<ceiling|Dumori> Borg
*Dermathil wonders if perma-voice exists on this server.
<DashOrCrash> I just woke up, so I really need the coffee.
<Fluttershy`> 9I give up. I don't see NewDCD for now and I love green so much I must give in ;___;
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'd prefer to call it my Rider Kick, Fluttershy`
<DashWithRainbows> the stream yesterday was awesome!
<DashOrCrash> well, not NEED, just WANT
<ceiling|Dumori> I think Solarstorm Dermathil
<Dermathil> wat? Solarstorm has permavoice?
<Apokalipse> the stream was indeed awesome
<ceiling|Dumori> So
<ceiling|Dumori> No
<Luna> 07it was?
<Apokalipse> yup
<RobotPinkie> 06,15>mfw I talk about using my Rider Kick on Fluttershy`, and suddenly she has DCD colors
<Luna> 07,1 I passed out saturday in the afternoon
<DashWithRainbows> better than having to watch BMN euroshow
<ceiling|Dumori> Auto complete is a dick
<Fluttershy`> 9..... sorry.... ;____________________; I would use yellow
<Dermathil> Hipster_Brony has yellow already<
<Apokalipse> We did watch BMN euroshow... well half of it
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol I didn't mean like that
<Dermathil> Though I hasn't seen him in so darn long
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I meant he loves Kamen Rider, Fluttershy` :P
<ceiling|Dumori> Mods need distinct colours
<DashWithRainbows> i could not stand to watch those terrbile movies for one second..
<Fluttershy`> 9OH
<Fluttershy`> 9lol
<Apokalipse> We did watch the MLP movie though...
*Luna hugs Fluttershy`
<Abbey1053> 14LOOOOL
<DashWithRainbows> i know but i didnt want to rewatch them...
*Fluttershy` 9hugs Luna back "awww you okay?"
<Cynder7> 6:D
*Dermathil has been around since before RainBroDash was a mod and is still a normal viewer. He pulls monies out and start to think of how much to "lobby" for permavoice.
<DashWithRainbows> even then on BMN i just muted MLP movie
*RobotPinkie meows at Luna
<Fluttershy`> 9>>;
<Fluttershy`> 9<<;
<Dermathil> This needs more flute...é
<ceiling|Dumori> X3
*Fluttershy` 9has only been around since... a little over two weeks ago.

<DashWithRainbows> would of been on longer earlier today but i wanted some sleep after party...
<Dermathil> But I haven't missed a single one and was at all the special events.
<Luna> 07,1 it does not matter how much you've been around or not...
<ceiling|Dumori> I lurked a lot early
<ceiling|Dumori> We know
<Abbey1053> 14o.o

<Abbey1053> 14I remember he said he had a hockey stick
<DashWithRainbows> you will learn in time Fluttershy`
<Abbey1053> 14that he used to hit his parents with
<Abbey1053> 14if he wa spissed off
<Fluttershy`> 9I'm always asking other mods for help because I'm so clueless >_<
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Abbey1053> 14and they came in his room
<Cynder7> 6Poor people xD
<Luna> 07,1 indeed give it time
<ceiling|Dumori> Wait is Fluttershy` pre leverage?
<Dermathil> time... Q_Q
<Dermathil> xD
<RobotPinkie> 06,15What matters is how pretty you are, and also if you wear jeans or khakis.
<Fluttershy`> 9pre leverage?
<Fluttershy`> 9Khakis!
<Cynder7> 6Come to think of it I kinda remember something like that
<Luna> 07,1 oh dear..leverage...
*Luna hides
<DashWithRainbows> >jeans...
<Dermathil> leverage is BattleField-Earth
<Abbey1053> 14xD
<ceiling|Dumori> Leverage meme.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Shhh! Don't give away the secret, Fluttershy`! :P
<Dermathil> WHERE WAS GONDOR WHEN LEVERAGE...
<Dermathil> (and it goes on and on and on)
<MeteorVenture> i think my finger and the backspace button fell in love.. they can't stay apart for too long
<Cynder7> 6Meh..I just came across a screenie I had uploaded some years ago,that's all :P
<Fluttershy`> 9what about leverage though? I'm so confused.
<Fluttershy`> 9Pre-leverage? What does it mean? ;___;
<MeteorVenture> >implying they even try >:(
<Fluttershy`> 9WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Fluttershy` knows not of leverage, no. That's like... maybe the first night I was here?
<Abbey1053> 14O: I see
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I think I missed most of it, though.
<Apokalipse> Leverage. A meme from Battlefield earth
<ceiling|Dumori> I applied for mod before that...
<ceiling|Dumori> I think
<Apokalipse> I missed battlefield earth, so I have no clue either
<Luna> 07,1 once again it does not matter how much you've been around.. that's only 1 part of the puzzle

<RobotPinkie> 06,15what color is it in mIRC?
<Luna> 08,1indeed Dumori

<Luna> 08,1that was the plan
<Revolver> mfw people post CoD multiplayer scores in the weapons section of game dev in deviantart....
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah it is yellow on black here too
<RobotPinkie> 06,15before it was orange on black.
<Luna> 08,1yea this is for flutter
*Scope grooves. Which is hard to do in armor. <.<
<MP> I am secretly Fluttershy` but I... yeah
<Veewave> I agree MP
<MP> =_=
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ahhh
<MP> I made Mibbit angry
<DashWithRainbows> mfw people actually prefer CoD ver Battlefield when it comes to multiplayer
<Revolver> O hai MP
<MP> why is your text yellow to me Luna?
<Rodman> I am secretely Disqord, but don't tell anyone.
<Rodman> SHHH!

*RainBroDash 10will be forced to go afk
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<Revolver> eeeeyup
<Rodman> Why RainBroDash?
<Kabaka> Armor is cool.
<DashWithRainbows> mfw i cant read...
<Rodman> Wait, what arguments? Of what gameS?
<Scope> Cuz this is an OC and he's a guard. :D
<Apokalipse> I like to refer to them as 'sicussions'
<Revolver> http://th05.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2011/233/1/7/high_polygon_pulse_rifle_by_drakuaza-d47cv2o.jpg
<PinkiePie> If I had a dollar for everyone who OC'd a guard, then I'd have 15 dollars.
<Revolver> argue about that picture
<MP> Luna can you kick my ghost? I know there's a command for it myself but currently forgot it
*Revolver hugs MP

<Rodman> What do you mean?
<PinkiePie> Suuuure
<RainBroDash> 10in Fluttershy` 's name
<Luna> 07,1it's a trend
<Apokalipse> It is?
<Revolver> she cant use just Fluttershy because of the Fluttershy bot or something
<Scope> Alright, how about an OC who's a semi-retired guard, still in reserve but builds telescopes?
<RainBroDash> 10Fluttershy bot? O.o
<Fluttershy`> Just like socks
<PinkiePie> Not as common!
<Rodman> Theres a Fluttershy bot?

<Fluttershy`> 08,1but his totally trolling made me so happy
<Rodman> I was expecting Q
<Rodman> I got Q
<Rodman> I nerdgasmed
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I wasn't expecting him to act quite so much like Q
<ArcticVanguard> Rodman: I did too :D
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I did expect elements of that, but wow.
<DashWithRainbows> i knew that vid would happen soon
<Silvermane> i honestly wish i had seen more Star Trek, for Q after all this talk of it
<Rodman> After the first episode, My Mind = Blown
<ArcticVanguard> Only change I would've made was doing away with the evil laugh and replace it with a humerous one
<RainBroDash> 10inb4 everybody shouts at RainBroDash
<Rodman> Nah man, is a good laugh
<DrunkAristocrat> I am actually downloading star trek right now because of all this talk about Q :x
<ArcticVanguard> He enjoys what he does, he thinks it's hilarious, why would he laugh evilly other than it being a kid's show
*RainBroDash 10keeps hearing about this Q fellow, has no idea who he is...
<Rodman> RAINBRODASH, WATCH IT DAMMIT!
<ArcticVanguard> DrunkAristocrat: You won't regret it, just make sure it's The Next Generation, it's the most popular of the series. Personally I prefer Voyager, but there's more Q in TNG
<Fluttershy`> 08,1moo
<DashWithRainbows> RainBroDash: i wont yell, im asking you nicely to watch it
<DrunkAristocrat> yeah I am downloading TNG

<MeteorVenture> well if that's the case.. what about the yet to be aired episodes? we're all doomed!

<Fluttershy`> 08,1if all dis text will make sense
<Fluttershy`> 08,1after I have slept?
<Silvermane> Fluttershy`, Luna, can i be a brides maid?
<Awesomeshy> I hope they like
<RinBarDosh> 10http://i.imgur.com/0Lgme.png Dat spike at 10 kb per sec
<RinBarDosh> 10I feel like a god
<Awesomeshy> don't even really beat him
<Awesomeshy> and he just gets bored
<Awesomeshy> and puts everything back
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I am a god
<MakerDusk> so like Q...
<Awesomeshy> and then shows up in like 3 or 4 more episodes again
<Awesomeshy> ye
<PinkiePie> They'll beat him using a magical mcguffin device
*Fluttershy` turns into a tree
<Scope> Yeah, I was told the animators watched Q episodes of TNG to get the flash right. Obviously they had to "pony it up", but still.
<thedukeoffail> Fluttergod?
<Apokalipse> update your uTorrent :p
<RinBarDosh> 10no u apokalipse
<RinBarDosh> 10no u.
<MakerDusk> send him out to bother some poor lost ponies in the delta quadrant
<thedukeoffail> isn't 2.2.1 the latest uTorrent? :x
<Fluttershy`> 08,1FlutterTreeGod
<Apokalipse> no
<Awesomeshy> you mean
*DashWithRainbows stares at tree "why is got pink leafs and yellow bark?"
<Awesomeshy> there's a job you can watch star trek
<Diftraku> RinBarDosh, http://i.imgur.com/TuqKF.png
<Awesomeshy> and get paid for it
<Apokalipse> I have uTorrent 3.0 and it's not the latest version
<thedukeoffail> o_O
<thedukeoffail> welp
<Scope> A job where you can listen to "Proud to be a Brony" over the speakers, too.
<MakerDusk> err... I've got no pony equivalent for the delta quadrant and Voyager...
<RinBarDosh> 10FFFFF
<Scope> Captain Neighway
<Apokalipse> suddenly 3 hours for me to download that
<RinBarDosh> 10also nice windows aero
<Awesomeshy> lololo
<RinBarDosh> 10I assume you must have more than 2BG ram, unlike RBD
<RinBarDosh> 10 2GB*
<thedukeoffail> :<
<Diftraku> 8GB, quadcore Phenom II
<thedukeoffail> RBD y u make me sad D:
<Diftraku> Win7 Ultimate 64bit :P
*RinBarDosh 10has win7 on his desktop
<RinBarDosh> 10eeeshame it also has 2gb of ram :>
<thedukeoffail> I put win8 on my netbook
<RinBarDosh> 10lolwat
<Pinkamena> Diftraku: I'm jelly. 4GB, Tri-core Athlon II
<thedukeoffail> but I don't like it much :\
<Pinkamena> 32bit XP
<Diftraku> :P
<Apokalipse> >mfw I have 504mb of ram
<Apokalipse> win XP
<Diftraku> Pinkamena, I got windows installed on an SSD
<Apokalipse> haha!

<Diftraku> http://www.tumblr.com/photo/1280/10335535017/1/tumblr_lroxj5LSD41r29q8i
<Pinkamena> Diftraku: Yeah that's my plan for the future, assuming I don't have to upgrade the processor first 'cause it blows. Luckily by locking one of the cores, I was able to push the overclock a little higher than I could with three cores
<Diftraku> Yeah
<Diftraku> 3 cores suck
<Pinkamena> Diftraku: So I have 3 settings: stock, 2 cores with 15% OC, and stock speeds with an unlocked fourth core
*RinBarDosh 10doesn't understand this core mumbo jumbo
<RinBarDosh> 10and hai Wrek
<Diftraku> At some point, one chip manufacturer said they used broken quads to make tris
<Pinkamena> That's probably AMD
<Diftraku> so you could unlock the 4th core with a program
<Wrek> 05ohai
<Diftraku> OHai Wrek
<Dashite> Intel didn't bother with Tri-cores IIRC
<Fluttershy`> 08,1WREK

<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, Portal works <3
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Not feeling like playing now, though.
<RinBarDosh> 10I don't have any on this PC, it has a horribly small HDD
<Wrek> 05well the mc server is up robot :P

<Wrek> 05well the creeper blew away the fireplace
<DashWithRainbows> to me i hate it because it makes it really slow for me
<Wrek> 05which made the fire spread upwards
<Diftraku> lol
<Diftraku> that sucks
<Apokalipse> Thatsssss a nice fireplace you got there
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Just need to finish watching some horror, Wrek

<thedukeoffail> tasty choclate muffin
<thedukeoffail> chocolate*
<thedukeoffail> (and tea)
<Apokalipse> I should draw a still from S2 again
<Apokalipse> too lazy to look for one
<Apokalipse> awww
<RinBarDosh> 10I can find you one
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It's good practice.
<Apokalipse> Would you?
<RinBarDosh> 10as long as it's from the first 6 minutes of the episode
<Diftraku> http://blackmorass.deviantart.com/art/Breaking-News-258912740
<Apokalipse> xD it can be from the first 6 minutes
<MantisToboggan> i never draw
<MantisToboggan> except i drew a couple of ponies based on vectors
<MantisToboggan> then i was like enough with cheating i'll try to draw "blind"
<MantisToboggan> and it didn't look like a pony
<thedukeoffail> :x
<MantisToboggan> this story brought to you by bored irc'er
<Apokalipse> I tried drawing ponies with no reference, but that didn't work out
<Apokalipse> so now I want to practice
<thedukeoffail> drawing with no reference requires you to be able to remember what it's supposed to look like and imagine it properly I guess
<thedukeoffail> so you can draw by looking at your imagination
<thedukeoffail> probably
<Apokalipse> I can draw a pony from the side with no reference
<Apokalipse> but that's pretty much it
<RinBarDosh> 10the only stills I can really get are the CMC ones from the beginning. The rest is all covered with chocolate rain, and I can imagine that just being annoying
<Apokalipse> I don't plan on drawing everything
<Apokalipse> Just the pony maybe
<thedukeoffail> space pony

<MantisToboggan> i just cheat
<MantisToboggan> lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15What up, Ziltoid?
<Ziltoid> hey rb

<Diftraku> Seriously, don't d o it
<Rainbow-Dash> Hide yo kids, hide yo wife. I just found a stick of dynamite on terraria. Be very afraid
<Apokalipse> I would kill myself with that
<Rainbow-Dash> There is a good chance I will to..
<Apokalipse> FOR GREAT JUSTICE!
*Owlowiscious stays away from Rainbow-Dash
<Natleyn> Hoo.
<RinBarDosh> 10Well I had that, many many skittle bombs (a shot of cointreau in half a glass of monster, but I had no shot glass to measure it, so I just threw in too much cointreau), and 4 cans of kopparberg
<RinBarDosh> 10that was enough for a nice night
<RinBarDosh> 10>cans. Bottles*
<RinBarDosh> 10but never mix Monster and Dragon soop in one night. I did some things I regret
*DashWithRainbows wont ask about it
<Apokalipse> 83 percent done with downloading S2 E1
<prince-dari> MFW skittle bombs
<prince-dari> Do want
<Diftraku> You and your fancy energy drinks Jäeger Battery is the way to go

<RinBarDosh> 10my friend almost exclusively drinks red rooster
<prince-dari> Oh God no.

<prince-dari> That stuff is horrible.
<prince-dari> >UK
<RinBarDosh> 10red rooster jagerbombs (with hawkmeister = cheapo jager), and red rooster with GLENS vodka

*Natleyn pats Alliszero
<RinBarDosh> 10that guy is literally a nutcase
<RinBarDosh> 10he should have died already
<Natleyn> I know that feel, bro.
<AllisZero> Yeah, I turned 25 and bought a case of Smirnoff
<prince-dari> INB4 someone falls from the top of a tree again
<AllisZero> Cause for the past 4 years I really only drank beer, just for the booze really
<RinBarDosh> 10alliszero I can't 'acquire the taste' for beer, it's too bleugh for me
*Diftraku loves the fact you can buy all the alcohol when you turn 20
<Diftraku> Finland, u so silly
*RinBarDosh 10is not 20, can legally buy alcohol
<RinBarDosh> 10UK you so smart
*AllisZero is brazillian. Could buy all the alcohol he wanted at 14.
<Diftraku> You can legally buy alcohol after you turn 18 :P
<RinBarDosh> 10alliszero wins everypony
*Apokalipse is not 18. Cannot legally buy alcohol
<Diftraku> Truly does
<DashWithRainbows> if you have an ID then sure
<AllisZero> I'm glad I live in the states nowadays, gave me a few more years of not knowing how great getting drunk is when you're depressed
<Diftraku> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5EIYzES8r0&feature=related
<RinBarDosh> 10alliszero, my life is too awesome for sadness
<RinBarDosh> 10sorry bro :<
<AllisZero> I wish I had that outlook about my life :p
<AllisZero> But I'm happy for you RBD
<Diftraku> I was actually quite depressed for most of spring...
<Natleyn> Nowadays I punch sadness in the face with ponies and doing stuff.
<Diftraku> Then I found ponies
<Natleyn> ^
<RinBarDosh> 10wellllll, apart from friday night/saturday morning, eww. But yeah that was an exception
<AllisZero> Well my birthday just passed on thursday, and I actually didn't care much about it
<DashWithRainbows> im not looking forward to my b-day
<AllisZero> Which is good, because I feel like shit the weeks prior and Ponies I have to thank
<DashWithRainbows> it will be crap and i know it
<AllisZero> Brb brunch
<RinBarDosh> 10my birthday was relatively mediocre, I just slept it off

<Apokalipse> My birthday was spent in Berlin
<Diftraku> When you can have all of them at once
<DashWithRainbows> hmmm
<DashWithRainbows> all i can think of is Brinner
<RinBarDosh> 10Diftraku because splitting into smaller meals is great for keeping the weight down ;)
<RinBarDosh> 10such is the law of the rainbrodash.
<Diftraku> I woke up 2 hours ago, it's 20PM
<DashWithRainbows> > i can eat as much as i want and i dont gain wieght

<trebthegamer> hello?
<DragonSoop> 10Dragon soop encompasses all the win in the known universe.

<DashWithRainbows> yes duke
<DragonSoop> 10dari, you don't know the best of it
<prince-dari> You don't want them back.
<DashWithRainbows> Mods make sure everything runs smoothly
<thedukeoffail> I thought all IRC networks just went with nepotism
<DragonSoop> 10I was at my friend's house, her parents were away
<LordCelestia> Ive been coming here like every day for like a week so i figured why not help out?
<DragonSoop> 10MFW she has a 14 year old sister, who also had friends round
<prince-dari> ...
<DragonSoop> 10mfw expected that^
<DashWithRainbows> same here LordCelestia , mostly because of how many people came onto bronystate
<DragonSoop> 10*it's all going to plan*
<DashWithRainbows> IMO there was not enough mods
<Apokalipse> >mfw I can now watch S2 EP1 in 1080p and DragonSoop can't
<DragonSoop> 10F U

<trebthegamer> i'd love to help but i got short attention span and i probably won't remember any commands
<DragonSoop> 10but basically, unfortunately most of my friends who were there on friday night also think the same of me as you do
<DragonSoop> 10so the creepy lulz ensued
<LordCelestia> Ive always wanted to kick someone and say "TO THE MOOOOON"
<prince-dari> Creeper!

<Diftraku> Who doesn't like a bit of r34 every now and then to spruce up your daily routines
<Diftraku> Gives that nice touch of WTF on it
<TheDukeofFail> lol
<AllisZero> Does that guy spend his entire day drawing MLP?
<Rainbow-Dash> I just took a bath in a lake of fire on Terraria
<Rainbow-Dash> =(
<Diftraku> lol
<TheDukeofFail> he just seems to draw ponies p much 24/7
<Apokalipse> lol
<TheDukeofFail> he has a webcomic too iirc, about lesbians
<TheDukeofFail> so I guess he draws that
<Flaria> Rainbow-Dash: Why D:
<TheDukeofFail> as well
<Apokalipse> Rainbow-Dash https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hwvMkCUynU0/TmuAMzYjKwI/AAAAAAAAONA/t--pZrG6dJs/s640/Sea%252520Pony%252520Lyra%252520and%252520Prince%252520Adam.jpg
<Rainbow-Dash> It was a rather stupid mistake
<Apokalipse> That picture is always relevant
<Diftraku> mfw looking at dA
<Diftraku> http://i.imgur.com/VPQoD.png
<Diftraku> It exploded overnight
<AllisZero> Oh god
<Rainbow-Dash> I have over 10k images in my DA inbox
<Rainbow-Dash> Lol
<Diftraku> lol
<Rainbow-Dash> I watched one of the bigger MLP fangroups
<Diftraku> I cleared mine onThursday
<Rainbow-Dash> I wish there was an option to save all search results on DA
<AllisZero> The pinkie getting a shower of chocolate with a sexy face
<AllisZero> Y U DO THIS
<Rainbow-Dash> I would download all 90k+ MLP images to my harddrive
<Diftraku> The http://mlp-fim.deviantart.com/ one?
<Rainbow-Dash> Even if it was several hundred GB
<AllisZero> Seriously he DOES draw ponies all day doesn't he
<Rainbow-Dash> I think so Diftraku
<Rainbow-Dash> I dont go on DA much
<TheDukeofFail> I'd draw ponies all day
<Edward_Newgate> Diftraku http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4&feature=feedlik
<TheDukeofFail> if I could
<Diftraku> Anyhoof, I had fun times logging on the EQD irc yesterday over the school shell
<Diftraku> It exposes my shell username to public
<Diftraku> Which is a no-no-no
<Rainbow-Dash> I would ship Caramel with Sea Ponies all day.
<Rainbow-Dash> If I could
<Rainbow-Dash> XD
<DashWithRainbows> disconnect out of nowhere
<RustedDrone> drawing a pony standing.... those legs are hard, esp while standing

<TheDukeofFail> PONIES?
<TheDukeofFail> get out
<Diftraku> lol
<Rainbow-Dash> You wish
<AllisZero> Well I guess if I had as big a following as him, I'd probably draw all the time too
<Flaria> ;~;
<Flaria> So much art...
<Flaria> So much to download...
<AllisZero> Love doing it, but being a nobody and spending all my time on it don't make me happy
<Diftraku> Is there anything on the stream atm?
<DashWithRainbows> he probably gets paid for some of it
<Diftraku> afaik he does commissions
<AllisZero> Yeah, I assume he does
<AllisZero> I need to draw more ponies, maybe I can get more exposure that way
<DashWithRainbows> i need to learn how to draw ponies
<TheDukeofFail> AllisZero: draw lots of ponies really well
<TheDukeofFail> submit to reddit and other such places
<TheDukeofFail> all the time
<TheDukeofFail> with your name over everything
<DashWithRainbows> i got a good idea for a drawing but i shall never tell until i get enough skill
<AllisZero> Eh, that's not my style really
<TheDukeofFail> well then stop complaining about not being popular :P
<AllisZero> Well, being popular isn't high up there on my list
<AllisZero> But being completely invisible sucks too
<TheDukeofFail> :(
<TheDukeofFail> well then
<TheDukeofFail> get someone else to submit your stuff to reddit ;/
<TheDukeofFail> if it's good
<TheDukeofFail> I'm happy to accept the karma ¬_¬
<TheDukeofFail> gotta get dem meaningless points
<TheDukeofFail> on a website
<AllisZero> Lol haha
<AllisZero> I don't care much, and it's easy to find me on DA
<TheDukeofFail> http://alliszero.deviantart.com/gallery/ ?
<AllisZero> Eyup
<TheDukeofFail> WHERE ARE THE PONIES
<AllisZero> 's what I mean, I need to draw them more :P
<TheDukeofFail> lawl
<TheDukeofFail> well

<TheDukeofFail> I'll quietly submit them to /r/mylittlepony
<TheDukeofFail> and REAP THE REWARDS
<TheDukeofFail> also you might get people to know you or something I dunno

<DashWithRainbows> the thing about John joseco is the rule 34 stuff/shipping
<Flaria> You draw well :3
<DashWithRainbows> i hate it so much
<TheDukeofFail> most of the r34 stuff he draws is pretty hilarious at least
<AllisZero> Yeah that's not up my alley, I'm not a huge fan of rule34 on MLP
<TheDukeofFail> and not too graphic
<TheDukeofFail> but yeah
<TheDukeofFail> r34 and ponies is just a mindfuck /o\
<AllisZero> Eh I don't mind funny flank shots
<DashWithRainbows> i hate rule 34 MLP

<Diftraku> Brohoof
<DragonSoop> 10D:
<AllisZero> Brohoof dude.
<TheDukeofFail> hmm
<TheDukeofFail> I always saw a brohoof as like a fist-bump type thing
<TheDukeofFail> but ok
<TheDukeofFail> I guess you're right :x
<Flaria> I've used highhoof from time to time
<TheDukeofFail> (I am the duke of fail after all)
<Flaria> Brohoof is more of a straight on movement.
<DashWithRainbows> i agree
<Flaria> Highhoof is over the head, at least.
*TheDukeofFail ponders
<Diftraku> Observe
<Diftraku> Brohoof: http://i.imgur.com/Bpt5f.gif
<TheDukeofFail> yes
<DashWithRainbows> best bro hoof gif i have ever seen
<TheDukeofFail> so I should have highhoof'd
<TheDukeofFail> which is what I tried to do but failed
<TheDukeofFail> miserably
<Flaria> Ugh. I was supposed to study today, but without the book all I have is a bunch of stuff to memorize and not understand.
<DashWithRainbows> i was suppost to do homework
<DashWithRainbows> but i have 18 free lessons a week to do it in so..

<TheDukeofFail> :3
<Apokalipse> <.<
<Diftraku> lol
<Diftraku> I'm so paranoid on having irssi send my nickserv ident automatically...
<TheDukeofFail> I just connect via a bnc so I never have to ident anyway, most of the time ¬_¬
<WhatPayne> Hey guys what's going on in this channel?

<Apokalipse> I give the same amount of fucks as yourself
<TheDukeofFail> I have facebook open in a tab constantly
<Diftraku> They actually send you an e-mail...
<TheDukeofFail> I don't need it
<TheDukeofFail> I just like having tabs open
<TheDukeofFail> it makes me feel important
<TheDukeofFail> :c
<Apokalipse> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIDiA5c239M&feature=related
<Diftraku> I got facebook chat open in a pidgin ripoff
<Diftraku> (Raptr client)
<Diftraku> As a Finn, I'm not sure how to react to that video
<Diftraku> let me consult my fellow finns
<Apokalipse> As a brony you should react: AAAAWESOMEEE
<WhatPayne> Oh dear Lordi...
<Diftraku> But it's Lordi...
<WhatPayne> Finns can't hate Lordi
<WhatPayne> ^ a fact
<Apokalipse> >mfw lordi were the best winners of the eurovision in the 2000's
<Apokalipse> Not like it has much competition
<Diftraku> I'll conclude that mfw http://i.imgur.com/m6yDM.jpg to that video
<WhatPayne> Yes. That also is the reason we are in forever debt to Lordi
<Apokalipse> yup
<Diftraku> We now have a reason to never ever take part in Eurovision... yet we still do it

<TheDukeofFail> I guess
<LunaTheForgotten> How are there 55 bronies in here on Sunday?
<TheDukeofFail> mo bronies mo problems
<Apokalipse> Actually I recall reading that scootaloo the sadist isn't done by crookedtrees
<Trollestia> Why not?
<DashWithRainbows> looks like same art style
<Apokalipse> It does, but it's a bit different
<DashWithRainbows> also never go onto the Futaequestria tumble page
<Apokalipse> don't take my word for it though, I read it in the ponibooru comments
<Diftraku> ALLMYLOVE for that link
<DashWithRainbows> its rule 34
<Apokalipse> So it may be by crookedtrees anyway
<Spyrorocks`> hey Aristeo
<Spyrorocks`> got everything sorted out with the server now?
<TheDukeofFail> "Futaequestria"
<TheDukeofFail> wat
<TheDukeofFail> is that what I think it must be
<TheDukeofFail> because ohgod
<Trollestia> Has the stream done Full Metal Jacket yet?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15No r34/gore links, please.
<Trollestia> Also, "Futaequestria." That doesn't bode well.
<DashWithRainbows> not going to link
<Spyrorocks`> i think mysql is having serious issues
<DashWithRainbows> just warning you guys
<DashWithRainbows> i learned the hard way...
<Diftraku> lol
<Diftraku> My mind is a twisted and sick place, r34 is not going to move me much...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Same here, just warning, NSFW links should go in personal messages.
<AllisZero> Look
<AllisZero> I mean...
<Trollestia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WehoPJtnH30
<waitingfornick> lol
<AllisZero> If you choose to go to 18analsluts.com, you kind have to know beforehand what you're getting into.
<Diftraku> lol
<AllisZero> A website named FUTAEQUESTRIA should give you some pretty strong hints of what its contents are
<Wrek> 05what is this i dont even...
<waitingfornick> i was just clicking links....
<waitingfornick> not reading them
<AllisZero> But yeah my chair needs replacing =(
<AllisZero> Does anyone have good experiences with mesh computer chairs?
<waitingfornick> nope
<DragonSoop> 10eeenope
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Doesn't matter, not everyone knows what they're getting into.
<DragonSoop> 10my chair is a robust wooden bastard with a tiny built in cushion
<waitingfornick> im usually on my bed when on laptop
<Wrek> 05im basically sitting in a 1 man couch with an extended USB cord for mouse n keyboard

<Apokalipse> yeah penisland.net is a great example too
<Wrek> 05we get the point
<Trollestia> Ask Scootaloo...I think I follow a tumblr thread now.
<Diftraku> Wrek, I should probs head over at somepoint :P
<Apokalipse> Greeat place if you like pens
<Wrek> 05next time is a kick
<Flaria> Hiya RobotPinkie
<Apokalipse> ...not a fan of pens or islands I see
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Hay Flaria
<AllisZero> penisland -> actually a SFW website
<AllisZero> It's funny just because of that!
<waitingfornick> not gunna risk it
<AllisZero> Well the folks at the Pen Island department of IT weren't very bright
<Apokalipse> yeah it's a site for pens
<AllisZero> Or, geniuses
<Apokalipse> False advertising though
<Apokalipse> It's not even an island!
<Wrek> 05my response to the subject is...
<Wrek> 05http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8W361AJPTY&feature=feedlik
<Diftraku> lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15expersexchange is fine, therapistfinder is fine, too
<AllisZero> Wrek, sadly I want a setup like yours but don't have the space
<AllisZero> Wow, I go to expertsexchange a lot and never realized :P
<Diftraku> lol
<AllisZero> Actually I have the space but I honestly don't think I could live without a real desk
<RobotPinkie> 06,15The discussion was not going good places, still. :P
<Wrek> 05i have that aswell ofc
<AllisZero> I can't have both, my room LOOKS big but half of it is passageway to the garage/laundry room
<Wrek> 05then i jsut use the office chair i stole from dads work
<DragonSoop> 10Wrek, this is my computer cockpit as it was just over a year ago

<jasperdett|laptop> humm
<Wrek> 05but first, spring cleaning
<waitingfornick> xbox in the corner
<TheDukeofFail> I am sitting in an expensive office chair my dad stole from a location they were shutting down 8D
<Trollestia> Is there a cleaver on the desk?
<waitingfornick> my computer desk is now my xbox desk
<DragonSoop> 10trollestia... eenope? Point to it? :P
<AllisZero> It's his wallet
<Trollestia> Also, that's how many monitors to how many computers?
<Apokalipse> The best part of my awesome mancave is my alcantara chair.
<Apokalipse> And now I wonder how many people know what alcantara is
*Diftraku opens google
<Flaria> I'm sitting on my couch in my living room. >_>
<Flaria> Well, family living room.
<Apokalipse> It's fumb dabric
<Diftraku> "Alcantara is a tradename given to a composite material used to cover surfaces and forms in a variety of applications."
<AllisZero> I have to take many things into account when designing a workspace
<DragonSoop> 10trollestia it's 3 monitors, two to one computer (with one shared with xbox) and one to another computer
<AllisZero> Fapan is a very important consideration in my design
<DragonSoop> 10XD
<Trollestia> I see. Nice setup.
<Apokalipse> alcantara is basically expensive fumb dabric
<DragonSoop> 10oh, and the rightmost monitor is also connected to a gamecube and n64 you can't see
<Trollestia> http://askscootaloothesadist.tumblr.com/post/10018413040/i-still-love-her-though XD

<Trollestia> Why is there a Wii?
<AllisZero> V8
<DragonSoop> 10Dashite implying it's not in the minifridge? And it was Ale in there.
<AllisZero> LOTS OF IT
<AllisZero> And I don't even drink the damn thing
<Trollestia> At least ale's better than beer.
<Dashite> You mean it was all over your keyboard.
<mib_a344kx> hey

<RobotPinkie> 06,15My desk is just a table, Flaria.
<Dashite> I'm going to have to get a picture of my setup while it's relatively clean...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15My screen is an HDTV though, so it evens out...
<Dashite> My dresser counts as an extension of my desk...
<AllisZero> I built that desk

<DashWithRainbows> i hate that i dont have a good computer...
<AllisZero> Dat Thermometer
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I need to clean up my table before sharing...
<Diftraku> I've had a pneumonia for the past two weeks
<RobotPinkie> 06,15...and since I'm lazy, it's not going to happen today.
<DragonSoop> 10found the more up to date version of my 'battlestation', as it were

<AllisZero> Ah, I see
<Diftraku> Who here has a cleaning OCD?
<AllisZero> Yeah when I saw chrome on the right I realized it couldn't be
<NewDCD> I'm getting hugged
<NewDCD> And I'm still confused as to whether it's a brohug or a sishug
<Dashite> Cleaning OCD? AHAHAHAHAHA!

*Natleyn brohugs DCD again
<Diftraku> It is
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Thanks!

<DriftGouf> and then Chief Thunderhooves goes "MULTI-TRACK DRIFTING?"
<Flaria> I'm working on stuff. You can see it in my desktop picture xD
<Trollestia> Uploading picture.

*Diftraku sits smugly and listens to a pony playlist with 40 hours of music
<Trollestia> I'm not good with digital cameras.
<DriftGouf> Dear God I'm hungry
<Apokalipse> I should probably watch more Initial D only watched stage 1 and 2
<RobotPinkie> 06,15And then, my cellphone wouldn't recognize my SD card... the end.
<Driftcougar> And then Dancougar was a racing mech
<Flaria> Trollestia: What are the two flash drives for?
<Trollestia> In case I have to move things.
<DragonSoop> 10prawns
<Flaria> ^I don't see any shrimp
<Trollestia> I also have a flash card in the top of it.
<DragonSoop> 10they're for storing his child prawns
<Diftraku> lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I had a feeling that was you DCD :P
*NewDCD still wonders if Flaria is a boy or a girl
<Diftraku> District 9 was a good movie!
<DragonSoop> 10shrimp are child prawns aren't they? Or just smaller similar species?
<DashWithRainbows> anyone got a download link for all the songs from FiM season 1??
<DashWithRainbows> want to put them on mp3
*NewDCD IS A VERY CONFUSED PERSON
*ValtheJean slaps the confusion out of DCD
<Flaria> NewDCD: ಠ_ಠ
*Diftraku grabs a bucket of popcorn
<Diftraku> Modfight!
<Veewave> I'm rather bored.
<Veewave> by this fight
*NewDCD becomes even more confluttershuzzled
<Veewave> confusion bores me
<ValtheJean> 2,14 DON'T MAKE ME GET MY TRIDENT DCD
<Trollestia> It's like hockey. You break it up if there's no blood.
<Flaria> ^ >.>
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol...that nick wins :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 OBJECTION
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> That face! Flaria is a female, isn't she!?!
*DCDWrightAceStreamer points his finger
<Flaria> OBJECTION!
<Flaria> No.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 HOLD IT!
*DCDWrightAceStreamer accidentally pokes Val's eye out while doing so
<ValtheJean> 2,14 The witness never swore in!

<DCDWrightAceStreamer> MY CONFUSION IS EVEN GREATER NOW
<RobotPinkie> 06,15So are we still posting battlestation pics? :P
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> SO THIS IS WHAT PINKIE'S MIND THINKS LIKE
<Natleyn> :D
<Diftraku> lol
<DragonSoop> 10robotpinkie, if you've got one to post, do eeeeeeeeet
<Veewave> My boredom has increased.
<Natleyn> I just realized how much pony is on my desktop
*DCDWrightAceStreamer accidentally breaks a portal in front of him with his new Apotheosized Pinkie Pie Avatar status, which Val promptly falls into
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I think DCD should stream giant fighting robots <.< >.>
<Diftraku> My desktop is pony
<DragonSoop> 10meanwhile I shall share with valthejean the magic that is Dragon Soop
<DragonSoop> 10http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KD8wG-ccvA
<Natleyn> DCD, do you have Gun/Diebuster?

<WAGHERblargnghifh> 2,14 what....what the hell am I watching?
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> I'm on my mobile client
<Veewave> Hmm, vodka.
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> so no streaming from me
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> I also should be studying
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> but can't focus
<Natleyn> :C
<DragonSoop> 10WAGHERblargnghifh it's this ridiculous alcoholic energy drink, I guess it's like UK four loco? Except less banned and completely discontinued
<Diftraku> lol
<WAGHERblargnghifh> 2,14 I...see
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> >Energy Drink
*FlaschenJoe11 just came back from HELL!!
<Diftraku> Jägerbattery ftw
<DragonSoop> 10basically I drank some of it on friday night along with many other similar drinks, and the consequences will never be the same...
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> what you guys need is MANA ENERGY POTION
<DragonSoop> 10DCD from think geek?
<DragonSoop> 10win
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> you should youtube that shit right now
<Trollestia> What you guys need is Red Bull mixed with vodka.
<WAGHERblargnghifh> 2,14 dude, those drinks are awesome
<WAGHERblargnghifh> 2,14 the mana energy potions, that is
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> I just saw the videos and lol'd heartily
<Diftraku> No...
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> I can't get stuff like that here in Bumfuckistan
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> So yeah
<Diftraku> You need drinks like these http://i.imgur.com/XBVsU.jpg
<Apokalipse> I'll just leave this here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa2CavO29Vc&feature=related
<ValtheJean> 2,14 whew...back from that crazy dimension
<DragonSoop> 10Trollestia, I went through a whole bottle of Cointreau (or rather, a whole one minus 2-3 shots' worth) by just drinking it in Monster energy drink. That was yum.
<Diftraku> Barrel Roll
<Flaria> Oh god Diftraku, don't make ponies drive me to drink
<Diftraku> I will Flaria
<Diftraku> It is my destiny!
<TheDukeofFail> look at you drunks
<Trollestia> Wise Apple had whiskey. It's the best one because of this.
<TheDukeofFail> terrible
<Flaria> I don't have access to any, though, so it's just going to be me staring sadly at pictures
<FlaschenJoe11> Barrel Role Dash is funny
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I hate my phone's camera, such crap quality :(
<Wrek> 05i am so makign a speed demon
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> Hey Val
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yessums?
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> hear this idea of mine
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I shall hear it
<RobotPinkie> 06,15http://i.imgur.com/pcmFs.jpg http://i.imgur.com/JPJ0r.jpg
<RobotPinkie> 06,15So blurry.
<Diftraku> Pwnies!
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> Big Macintosh, humanized for plot reasons but having lived all of his life as a regular pony, and equipped in power armor, gets sortied into spaaaaaaace
<Diftraku> lol
<DragonSoop> 10RobotPinkie so blurry XD
<DragonSoop> 10<3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 why....? Why do you hurt me so DCD?
*ValtheJean cries
<TheDukeofFail> RobotPinkie do you have parkinsons or something ¬_¬
<TheDukeofFail> so shaky
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I will hug anyone who makes a comment on the game.
<Trollestia> But, ponies can wear Power Armour.
<TheDukeofFail> Pony Armour
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> A satellite that had thus been launched into orbit is actually an Orbital Bombardment Weapons Platform and needs BM's Power Armor to dock into it to work
<Diftraku> Zelda?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Not shaky, TheDukeofFail, this camera only works well during daytime.
<DragonSoop> 10Is it zelda? I can hardly see...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15With too little light, the shutter speed is about 2 seconds.
<DragonSoop> 10looks like TP's artwork? Or I've got zelda on the brain
<TheDukeofFail> well ok
<Trollestia> I can't make anything out.
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> meanwhile, the Earth Sphere is being overrun by thousands of abominable, monstruous enemies
<Diftraku> It looksl ike a GC case
<DragonSoop> 10or is it wind waker...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yes that's Wind Waker <3
<DragonSoop> 10XD robotpinkie did you see my gamecube?
<DragonSoop> 10http://i.imgur.com/izGg7.png
<Trollestia> I may be a horrible photographer, but at least my hand is steady.
<Flaria> cantseeshitcaptain.jpg
<DragonSoop> 10ohai D_E
<Denied_Existence> Hello
<Trollestia> per flaria
<DashWithRainbows> you better have pokemon colloseum in that gamecube
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> docking with the OBWP, he takes aim at thousands of enemies in the planet below....and fires a full salvo of laser-based weaponry
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Indeed, I'll take better pictures during daytime
<DragonSoop> 10definitely zoom in on the gamecube
<Denied_Existence> Hey, how the hell do I change my color using leafchat?
<Trollestia> Isn't that the plot of Van Buren, DCD?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That's 4 swords though :(
<DragonSoop> 10and that gamecube had wind waker in it I think, I was doing another playthrough of that after I did OoT again
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> it hits the enemies directly, piercing through them and killing them without causing any civilian casualities
<DragonSoop> 10But RobotPinkie it has wind waker -in- it I think D:
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh okay, then all is forgiven
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> how do you like yourself that display of thousand-targets Orbital Sniping?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It looks very cool, DragonSoop, but I really don't like the game so much.
<DragonSoop> 10also RIP that keyboard
<DragonSoop> 10it got a bit too drunk this one time, and decided to end its life in a blurred haze :S
<DragonSoop> 10dashite was there, it wasn't a pretty sight
<Dashite> :p
<Denied_Existence> Errrg, this is annoyint me
<Denied_Existence> annoying*
<Flaria> Whats up, Denied_Existence?
<AllisZero> Heck yeah Wild Tiger
<Denied_Existence> I am using leafchat and I cant figure out how the hell to change my color
<Nittany_Tiger> %C?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 youtube needs more Z2 veritechs
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Did you throw up on it, DragonSoop? :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 also, DCD you silly filly :P
<Nittany_Tiger> [xx] where x is a color value.
<Nittany_Tiger> Whoops.
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> Val: Macross All Attacks Z2
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> Yt that
<Denied_Existence> ...what kind of command would that be Nittany_Tiger?
<DragonSoop> 10RobotPinkie not exactly, just kinda spilt beer everywhere while on skype to my bronies watching Scott Pilgrim on BMN playing a scott pilgrim drinking game
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oooohhhhhhh.....so that ship is another SDF?
<Trollestia> What was the game?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I never realized that
<AllisZero> Wow
<AllisZero> Next season of Tiger and Bunny only coming out in the beginning of 2013?
<AllisZero> Boo
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ahhh okay, DragonSoop, gotcha :P
<Flaria> I missed Scott Pilgrim ;~;
<AllisZero> Guess I'll have to contend with Shana S3, if it's even watchable
<Nittany_Tiger> In chatzilla, xx changes color, but it only does it for one line of text.
*GrimGallop appears
<Nittany_Tiger> %Cxx
<Nittany_Tiger> xx is a number.
<DragonSoop> 10OH GOD ITS GRIMGALLOP EVERYPONY RUN
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Man, this android phone is so old, you can only program on it using FORTRAN

<DragonSoop> 10god I love it when bjornfort's in town
<RobotPinkie> 06,15My android phone is so old, it uses an Intel 4004 processor
<Flaria> At this point I'm just messing with pronouns to mess with DCD.
<Nittany_Tiger> I have been sleeping most of the day. I go back to sleep after watching church, and I couldn't stay awake.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Okay just one more: My android phone is so old, the only input option is punch cards
<Diftraku> RobotPinkie, be careful with those 0's, might lose that processor otherwise
<Sebiale> I just discovered the friendshipismagic forums.
<Bjornfot> Okay, so... are the mods sleeping, or what?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 zzzZZZZzzZZZZ

<Flaria> Welcome back ValtheJean
<RinBarDosh> 10wat
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm using haxx, I told you.
<Sumica> I see things are back to normal here.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 don't make me trident you
<RinBarDosh> 10XD haai sumica
<Apokalipse> eeeyup
*RobotPinkie licks ValtheJean
*Diftraku is Confluttershy...
<Dashite> 0,14O7M8G3! 9H11A4X7!
<RinBarDosh> 10MFW dashite has still only done that 2 times since the server change
<Denied_Existence> prince-dari btw, the op exceptions you gave to my voice function still aren't working you know?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ah, dari. I should have know
<Dashite> :p
<RinBarDosh> 10Dashite, how does it feel that you can't do it without getting autokicked anymore? XD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 known, even
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Colors are for mods, btw :P
<Dashite> RBD, you mean even when I have warnings left? :p
<RinBarDosh> 10I swear you have none now?
<RinBarDosh> 10I've seen you do it twice :3
<Sumica> RP that is an intersting color combo >_<
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol enough with gratuitous kicking though.
<Dashite> None now of course, but I got kicked there for the second warning. :p
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It looks bad on your client, Sumica?
<RBDTest0r> 10Teal Test uno
<RBDTest0r> 10Teal Test deux
<RBDTest0r> 10Teal Test five
<Sumica> pink and gray have bad contrast.
<Flaria> ^
<Sumica> I just have to highlight to see it.
<Trollestia> I turned colours off because I couldn't see gray.
<RinBarDosh> 10yeah I was just making sure it was 3 warnings -> kick, dashite
<RobotPinkie> 06,15This is supposed to be dark purple, Sumica
<DashWithRainbows> just found a austin powers movie on tv
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Weird.
<RinBarDosh> 10dark purple on white?
<DashWithRainbows> fuckyeah.jpg
<Dashite> Yeah, someone, not naming and names :p, was getting kick happy with chanserv. :p
<RobotPinkie> 06,15On light gray, RinBarDosh
<Sumica> perhaps it's just Xchat then.
<RinBarDosh> 10meh, white, light gray
<RinBarDosh> 10:3
<RinBarDosh> 10but yeah that's what it looks like to us mibbit commoners
<Sumica> or it looks pink with a gray BG.
<Dashite> RBD, why are you still on mibbit?
<Diftraku> I reserve the right to break awful looking color combos :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah xchat does have weird default colors, Sumica
<RinBarDosh> 10dashite, because easiness. I have mIRC and I'm not exactly a scrub, but easiness.
<Dashite> Ah
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'd recommend increasing the brightness of dark gray and light gray, or you won't be able to read Val's text either, really.
<Sumica> I see vals just fine
<Trollestia> Or turn off colours.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's cause I 1337
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Weird, I didn't
<RinBarDosh> 10valthejean lolnope
<RobotPinkie> 06,15In any case this should look fine on most clients
<Dashite> Turning off colours for the win!
<Sumica> then again vals bg is a light gray with dark blue text to me.
<Edward_Newgate> Pinkies's color looks pretty baws to me
<RinBarDosh> 10it's dark gray to me
<RinBarDosh> 10^
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, it's meant to be dark gray
<RinBarDosh> 10yeah, like dari's, but not
<Apokalipse> it is dark grey to me too
<Flaria> It's dark gray.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Thanks, Edward_Newgate <3
<Edward_Newgate> <333
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I like these colors :P
<Bjornfot> 0kids these days with your fancy text colours...
<DashWithRainbows> kids these days with there book of faces....
<Sumica_2> Lets see what it looks like over here.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, I did actually ask if I could keep normal text, but I was convinced not to. :P
<Apokalipse> The other mods would bully you
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes. Yes we would
<RinBarDosh> 10well the whole point of having colours is because when we need to say important things, we need to be heard
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Not really, but mods have color so it's easier to spot and read.
<Sumica> ok that is more ledgable now.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I LIEK PONIEZ
<Apokalipse> you say important things too RBD?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yes, what RinBarDosh said :P
<RinBarDosh> 10loonope Apokalipse
<RinBarDosh> 10lol*
<Apokalipse> Okay, just checking :p
<RinBarDosh> 10but yeah, obviously it is used and taken as a status symbol a lot, rightly so tbh :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15We just might potentially say something important... sometime in the distant future.
<Diftraku> then again, I can just set all colors in clientside to the same :P
<RinBarDosh> 10I definitely said something important this one time
<DashWithRainbows> just wondering if anyone is reading a fanfic right now?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15at band camp, RinBarDosh? :P
<Sumica> nooooo >_> <_<
<RinBarDosh> 10Diftraku it's mainly for the masses ofc
<RinBarDosh> 10and RobotPinkie definitely
<Diftraku> Ee-yup
<Flaria> o-o
*Trollestia is the masses, and cba to enable colours.
<Dari> 10I wonder if this will spam dari with notifications..
<Sumica> it might if he has dari aset as an extra word to search for.
<Denied_Existence> 3Dari Dari Dari Dari Dari Dari Dari Dari Dari
<Dari> 10MFW it doesn't matter, since people just spam dari anyway
<ValtheJean> 2,14 >implying he's even online to hear them

*Flaria gets hit on the head with a newspaper
<Sumica> It's my specal talent.
<Dari> 10that's the song that came on, for people's listening pleasure and to un-kill the chat :3
<Denied_Existence> 3Orly Sumica? What is your cutiemark then?
<Sumica> a blank expressionless face ofcorse.
<Dari> 10>even talking /about/ sumica kills the chat
<Dari> 10XD
<Dari> 10Master Race
*ValtheJean tridents sumica so that the chat may live
<Sumica> I could just go banish my self to work again.

<RinBarDosh> 10this PC only has 80 hours

<Diftraku> And the only cure is more pony
<Flaria> ^
*Flaria hugs Diftraku
<Diftraku> :P
<RinBarDosh> 10MFW one of many pictures of me drunk that I've just noticed were put up on facebook contains me pulling a 'dat ass' face. And I think it was my friend's younger sister that I was doing it at >.>

<Diftraku> lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I don't know what's going on here, but ponies.

<RobotPinkie> 06,15Powerful alcoholic beverage I guess.
<RinBarDosh> 10lol trollestia >.>
<ChocolateRainBroDash> exactly. If it spreads you are a silly pony that looks at little girls and everyone starts avoiding you like the plague... it's all right
<RinBarDosh> 10XD

<TheDukeofFail> BUT NO
<TheDukeofFail> I will not go down this road
<TheDukeofFail> it's a bad, bad road
<TheDukeofFail> VERY BAD
<DashWithRainbows> i will blockade the road to that
<Diftraku> Not it isn't!
<Veewave> I have a high matabolism.

<TheDukeofFail> I have to watch what I eat a bit or I get all pudgy :\
<RinBarDosh> 10D_E, need to do a case study on a self-confessed ephebophile? XD
<Icydragon> 12No you didn't...
<RainBroDash> 10ignore rinbardosh, he's crazy today
<ChocolateRainBroDash> Hmm. You know when you are browsing pony videos on youtube and find one that is absolutely AMAZING?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15TheDukeofFail, seriously, no links with r34 on them.
<Diftraku> I'm now going to watch ponies in 1080p on my TV
<ChocolateRainBroDash> Why does it take looking through about 30 bad videos to find it
<RainBroDash> 10ChocolateRainBroDash eeenope?
<Diftraku> Because I can
<RainBroDash> 10lolol diftraku, i jelly
<TheDukeofFail> RobotPinkie: it was asked for and I said it was nsfw :colbert:
<Veewave> 192cm tall
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I don't care if you add an NSFW warning, still not okay in this chat.
<Denied_Existence> 3I don't want to know about your Chronophillia RBD
<TheDukeofFail> well ok
<RainBroDash> 10D_E ;________;
<Denied_Existence> 3And we did ask for it RobotPinkie
<RainBroDash> 10another time then :3
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You did, Denied_Existence?
<Denied_Existence> 3So you can't blame him, blame me and RBD
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh okay
<ChocolateRainBroDash> responsible mods
<Denied_Existence> 3Yes we are!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Very responsible :P
<Denied_Existence> 3xP
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I should kick you both :P
<Awesomeshy> ohai
<RainBroDash> 10well, I didn't /request/ it, but tbh it was requested
<RobotPinkie> 06,15By who?
<RainBroDash> 10I know it's probably not right, so RBD is now no longer being lenient
<Veewave> <-- this pony ran out of gummyworms.
<RainBroDash> 10xD

<CTCB> Any news how many episodes Hasbro Ordered?
<CTCB> for Season 2
<prince-dari> Both 24 and 26.
<CTCB> prince-dari: How can it be both?
*DashWithRainbows is to busy reading Through the eyes...fanfic
<Awesomeshy> CTCB: not enough episodes
<CTCB> Maybe there is 24 episodes and 2 special episodes
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> IT'S VIOLET!
<DCDWrightAceStreamer> *cue pimpastic music based on It'sGendo.mp3*
<Natleyn> ^Fuck yeah.
<prince-dari> Anyone want to do my maths homework for me?
<Diftraku> Liarjack <3
<Nittany_Tiger> What subject?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15No, though I'm curious what level it's on, prince-dari
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'll do it Dari! And I totally wont purposefully suck at it!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 <.< >.>
<Natleyn> What kinda math, Dari? >.>
<prince-dari> Maths maths.
<prince-dari> :P
<RainBroDash> 10dari what module?
<RainBroDash> 10assuming C1 S1 or M1?
<prince-dari> C1
<prince-dari> Nice and simple. :P
<RainBroDash> 10i got 90-something percent
<RainBroDash> 10:D
<Nittany_Tiger> 1 + 1 = 2.
<Nittany_Tiger> There you go.
<prince-dari> You get an A* overall?
<RainBroDash> 10wait, which textbook do you use?
<RainBroDash> 10and nah lol
<RainBroDash> 10not at all
<RainBroDash> 10I got 2 marks off a B
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<prince-dari> Oh.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Not sure what C1 is, because I come from a real country.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15:P
<prince-dari> 'Understanding Pure Mathematics'
<Nittany_Tiger> Sounds like Number Theory.
<RainBroDash> 10ours is Heinemann modular mathematics - C1
<RainBroDash> 10I still have it
<prince-dari> This homework's on quadratics anyway.
<RainBroDash> 10want a hand? :P
<prince-dari> Well you could do it for me.
<prince-dari> :P
<RainBroDash> 10ahaha, well that depends how long it is
<Nittany_Tiger> s = e mod x. :p
<prince-dari> I'll drop a question in here if I get stuck. Heheheh.
<RainBroDash> 10alrightypoo
<Nittany_Tiger> Name your variables pony names, and if you get in trouble for that, say that "Well, a variable can have any name." because it's true.
<RainBroDash> 10YFW I can't remember how to complete the square
<prince-dari> Lawl
<RainBroDash> 10I think I can
<RainBroDash> 10it /was/ a while ago
<prince-dari> I'd be disappoint if you'd forgotten the formula for solving quadratics.
<CTCB> Spike/Rarity, Fluttershy/BM, Twilight/Trixie, Applejack/Rainbow, Pinkie/Luna...
<CTCB> Some of my Fave Pairings, One for each main cast...
<Dashite> Pfft, that's what google is for.
<RainBroDash> 10oh yeah I know that one
<Nittany_Tiger> I know it by heart.
<Diftraku> goddammit, 4th time I've seen the first ep
<Diftraku> Still can't get enough
<RainBroDash> 10completing the square is balls though, you only need it if it's a question which is designed to be solved by completing the square
<prince-dari> Heheheh.
<RainBroDash> 10Diftraku YFW you've already seen it 4 more times than me
<PinkiePie> I hate fan pairings. but I also love them
<Diftraku> I'll just watch it once more...
<Nittany_Tiger> You still haven't seen S2E1?
<CTCB> Yeah, I also like a bit of Twilight/Luna
<Natleyn> Nittany_Tiger: (-Fluttershy +- radical( Fluttershy^2 - (4 * Applejack * Rarity) ) ) / (2 * Applejack)
<CTCB> and PinkiePie: How is Spike/Rarity a fan pairing?
<Nittany_Tiger> Yes.
<Diftraku> That math...
<RainBroDash> 10no I haven't N_T
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<Diftraku> I could do
<CTCB> Spike has a crush on Rarity, so it is suggested in the show...
<RainBroDash> 10natelyn what if applejack = 0>
<RainBroDash> 10?*
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Rainbow-Dash, completing the square is useful to see how the formula is derived.
*RainBroDash 10prepares chat for implosion
<Nittany_Tiger> Applejack(Twilight_Sparkle)^2 + Rarity(Twilight_Sparkle) + Fluttershy = 0.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol wrong name
<RobotPinkie> 06,15RainBroDash :P
<RainBroDash> 10:L
*Natleyn hugs Nittany_Tiger
<RainBroDash> 10but in silly AS maths, it's menial
*Nittany_Tiger hugs back.
<Natleyn> I wish I had math classes left, so I could do that
<Natleyn> Maybe I will in physics.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I think it's important to go through it and understand it, but more than that? No, I guess that's pretty pointless.
<Nittany_Tiger> I could do it in my codes.
<PinkiePie> Meh, I only see that working one way
<CTCB> Whats that?
<RainBroDash> 10guess who gets the award for ruining what could have been an ok picture?
<RainBroDash> 10http://i.imgur.com/qHA5L.png me does
<Awesomeshy> one-way relationship = rarity isn't into it
<PinkiePie> In a creepy stalker kind of way
<PinkiePie> Yep
<RainBroDash> 10>..
<RainBroDash> 10>.>*
<Natleyn> Oh RainBroDash
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Keep calm and pony on.
<Natleyn> You so silly
<prince-dari> Hahaha
<RainBroDash> 10I just noticed the angle of my body
<RainBroDash> 10if that wall wasn't there, or was softer than a wall
<CTCB> Well, PinkiePie: The Mane 6 will live forever, Spike wont... he'll age
<CTCB> so it will work...
<CTCB> *could
<Awesomeshy> how is it implied the mane 6 are immortal
<TheDukeofFail> lol
<CTCB> Awesomeshy: Luna and Celestia were the elements, and they lived for a thousand years, and still are living... now the mane 6 have the elements, Celestia and Luna could begin to age again, and the Mane 6 would live forever, or until they pass the elements to new persons...
<Awesomeshy> CTCB: they weren't the actual elements, they used the elements
<Awesomeshy> even the mane 6 aren't the actual elements
<Awesomeshy> they're just represent the spirits of the elements of harmony
<Awesomeshy> why am i even arguing this I feel silly
<CTCB> Awesomeshy: Yes, thats what I mean, they use the elements, they are part of them... the Spirits...
<CTCB> I didn;t think this was an arguement...
<CTCB> I thought it was a discussion...
<Aristeo> Yeah I'm looking into it Spyrorocks -- it's not being blatant whatever it is
<Awesomeshy> you know what I mean
<Veewave> I found some nacho cheese but it has no flavor and makes my mouth sad.
<Awesomeshy> also, just because they represent the spirits of the elements of harmony doesn't mean they're like
<Awesomeshy> immortal gods
<DashWithRainbows> never had nacho cheese...
<TheDukeofFail> i don't know what that is
<Awesomeshy> celestia and luna have such a long lifespan because of their race
<TheDukeofFail> but cheese is p cool
<Natleyn> :C
<Veewave> T.T
<Awesomeshy> they're p much the closest things to gods in the show
<Awesomeshy> so obv they're immortal
<AllisZero> First time I had nacho cheese
<AllisZero> I guess I was 11 or so. My dad took me to a gas station that has one of those uber food courts, and they had hot-dogs with chilli and nacho cheese
<Natleyn> If you want cheap generic nacho cheese, go find some Monterey Jack, melt it and pour it over tortilla chips
<AllisZero> Felt like rape in my mouth
<DashWithRainbows> mfw you somehow know what rape in the mouth feels like :3
<Pontang> It's pretty obvious they should change the name to Pinkie Pie no yuutsu. ;x
<TheDukeofFail> :o
<TheDukeofFail> :O
<TheDukeofFail> :o
<TheDukeofFail> :O
<TheDukeofFail> ¬_____¬
<AllisZero> We've never seen a black hole, but we know what they are like!
<Diftraku> AllisZero, we have seen many of them
<Awesomeshy> densetsu no yuusha no Pinkie Pie
<Veewave> I think I'm beginning to understand what it feels like.
<Diftraku> They're called women's handbags
<RainBroDash> 10Alliszero I'm sure you know what rape in the mouth tastes like ;)
<RainBroDash> 10also mfw flashbacks from the rerapening...
<prince-dari> >_>
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, that's a bit different, because the only thing that comes out of a black hole is bose-einstein condensate.
<prince-dari> MFW I was expecting flashbacks from last night
<prince-dari> RainBro.

<RainBroDash> 10I never actually /raped/ these underage specimens
<RainBroDash> 10although funny how that reminds me of a funny story from another time
<prince-dari> So you say...
*prince-dari lurks
<prince-dari> O_o
<Veewave> Nachos->mouth rape->black holes.
<Nittany_Tiger> Cygnus X1?
<Diftraku> wat
<RobotPinkie> 06,15umad, Veewave?
<prince-dari> Finding turning points using completing the square. Why do?
<DashWithRainbows> and from what i remember, it was math?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Seriously, someone give me a coffee drip or something...
<PinkiePie> Oro?
<Spyrorocks> alright thanks
<Veewave> I'll get you some Dragon Soop.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<AllisZero> i'm getting hungry again
<prince-dari> I want to try that now.
<prince-dari> Dammit RainBro.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Thanks, I need to get drunk and ruin my keyboard <3
<RobotPinkie> 06,15>yfw this has actually happened to me, too.
<TheDukeofFail> I apparently ruined a keyboard by spilling drink under it
<TheDukeofFail> I miss my G15 :(
<prince-dari> >Bundle on a skateboard in the middle of a road
<prince-dari> >skin one arm on road
<prince-dari> XD
<Diftraku> There's only one bad thing in S2E1
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Man, I love when the Japanese have ghost story competitions <3
<Diftraku> "To be continued"
<TheDukeofFail> lol
<Saske> hi
<TheDukeofFail> tbh I thought some of S2E1 seemed a little rushed :x
<TheDukeofFail> but it was still really awesome
<RobotPinkie> 06,15True, Diftraku
<Diftraku> It is a bit
<RainBroDash> 10sorry I was.. awya
<prince-dari> Meh, 22 minute episodes.
<RainBroDash> 10away*
<prince-dari> Hard not to make it feel rushed
<RainBroDash> 10dari, what's teh question?
<TheDukeofFail> yeah
<Pontang> PinkiePie: you really do not want to know what 'oro' means...
<TheDukeofFail> adverts ruin everything
<TheDukeofFail> BBC4lyf
<Diftraku> the nonadvert 1080p version is pure win
<RobotPinkie> 06,15They need to have 45 minute episodes, and in the end House will turn out to have been right all along.
<prince-dari> BBC!
<prince-dari> Woo
<RainBroDash> 10BBC is the only bearable channel on uk tv
<RainBroDash> 10I can't stand adverts in general
<RobotPinkie> 06,15What about Dave, RainBroDash?
<Diftraku> Dat umbrella :P
<Nittany_Tiger> I've never known of a 1-hr cartoon show.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15:P
<Veewave> The store was out of Dragon Soop would you like some Bawls instead?(No alcohol)
<Nittany_Tiger> On American TV.
<Nittany_Tiger> Sans special episodes.
<Diftraku> Veewave, bawls to you
<RainBroDash> 10RobotPinkie dave has adverts
<RainBroDash> 10fuck adverts

<RainBroDash> 10Veewave after dragon soop I can't drink anything
<prince-dari> Lulz were had.

<Veewave> Yes yes, all bawls to me.

<prince-dari> So?
<TheDukeofFail> :(((
<Diftraku> try holding hards with just two hooves
<prince-dari> So they can't play cards...And?
<Nittany_Tiger> Imagine how they built their society with their dexterity issues.
<Dashite> Can't play cards? Humans > Ponies confirmed!
<Diftraku> Never
<TheDukeofFail> Ponyraku
<Ponyraku> Yes Duke

<Dermathil> >mfw my country's government wants to force all ISPs to install government-issued spyware to spy on everything people does with their internet without a warrant.
<Natleyn> D:
<Nittany_Tiger> Don't tell me America.
<TheDukeofPony> gonna see all that clop
<Ponyraku> Heh
<Ponyraku> You know how you can bypass that spyware?
<Ponyraku> SSH Tunnels
<Dermathil> Nittany_Tiger: Canada
<Nittany_Tiger> Ouch.
<TheDukeofPony> canada
<TheDukeofPony> used to be cool
<CTCB> Hello, Stomper, :)
<Ponyraku> I hate when countries have metered internet bw
<Natleyn> Hiya FreezeFrame
<Awesomeshy> when did Stomper get here
<CTCB> [22:37:24] Stomper has joined #ponychat
<Nittany_Tiger> And I've wanted to move their at times because of our crappy piracy laws and such.
<Awesomeshy> oh
<CTCB> Awesomeshy: ^^
<Awesomeshy> oh I see it now
<Dermathil> Quote from a webpage speaking about it: "The government is set to ram through a new set of electronic surveillance laws that will allow authorities to access private information of any Canadian, at any time, without a warrant. You'll be forced to pay for this online spying scheme."
<CTCB> ok, :)
<Nittany_Tiger> And ones to come.
<Stomper> oh hey it doenst get bold when you say my name :/
<Ponyraku> I know the perfect way to counter that
<Jason> Aristeo:
<Jason> Aristeo:
<Jason> Aristeo:
<Jason> Aristeo:
<Jason> I gots a dediiii!
<Jason> :DDd
<prince-dari> INB4 Anonymous attack the Canadian government
<Ponyraku> All citizens have the ability to spy on the government at anytime they want to
<Dermathil> I'd look forward to it, Prince-dari.
<Nittany_Tiger> At least they have arrested anyone in the US yet for PS3 modding.
<Spyrorocks> Jason, what datacenter
<Jason> ovh
<Dashite> Dermathil, isn't the most recent thing just about warrant-less information requests from ISPs?
<Awesomeshy> Stomper: you're doin' it wrong
<Jason> france
<Dermathil> Dashite: http://openmedia.ca/educate
<Spyrorocks> ovh is iffy
<Stomper> huh?
<Jason> :3 Its only the biggest server company
*Ponyraku puts on the foilhat before clicking that link
<Dashite> Yeah, I think that's they one they've been talking about recently.
<Dashite> It's about "lawful access"
<Veewave> What's this I hear about cardgames on pony-cycles?
<Veewave> I'm back.
<Ponyraku> Finnish ISPs have those blocklists installed
<Ponyraku> You can bypass them by using a non-ISP DNS
<Jason> Spyrorocks: Is it that bad?
<Dermathil> Ponyraku, the ISPs own the hardware for the interweb in the country and can throttle the interwebs here at anytime they want.
<Ponyraku> That sucks arse
<Nittany_Tiger> I think it's the same here.
<Dermathil> The two main ISPs have basically a biopoly.
<Ponyraku> We have unmetered internet here, just speedcapped based on how much you pay
<Dashite> What sucks more is that the only ISPs that don't throttle are smaller regional ISPs
<Spyrorocks> Ive had servers at ovh and friends at ovh
<Spyrorocks> its iffy
<Ponyraku> There's at least 2 major ones that cover the whole country: Elisa and Sonera
<TheDukeofPony> :x
<TheDukeofPony> http://i.imgur.com/9bTVL.png
<Ponyraku> Then there's smaller ones with limited availability
<AllisZero> American wireless carriers are doing deep packet inspection now
<Jason> Whats wrong with it?
<Dermathil> Dashite, don't forget that the CRTC has put a law that forces those smaller ISPs to limit the internet to 300GB/month
<AllisZero> Can't wait to see all of them being sued to shit
<Spyrorocks> bad service
<Ponyraku> AllisZero, deep packet inspection is a big no no
<Dashite> What? No, they don't.
<Spyrorocks> bad servers
<Dermathil> yes they did
<Spyrorocks> is what ive heard
<Dermathil> the law passed
<Spyrorocks> but give it a try maybe your experience will be better
<Jason> Well :3 Ill comment on that when iv had mine for a while
<Dashite> They weren't limited to 300GB by law.
<Ponyraku> Why are they even doing it?
<Jason> have you tried the kimsufi servers?
<Dashite> They were limited by what the ISPs they were leasing the lines from charged them.
<Ponyraku> Are they running out of countrywide bandwidth?
<Jason> $21/mo for 1TB HDD 2GB RAM, and a 2.44GHz proc
<Jason> its not the best
<Jason> but its great for the price
<prince-dari> WUT
<Spyrorocks> I wanted to start an ARM based budget server company
<Ponyraku> lol
<Spyrorocks> $10/month gets you a mini arm based box.
<RainBroDash> 10if trixie doesn't win
<Ponyraku> dari, could you get a link with those updates as well?
<Jason> ohh
<RainBroDash> 10this is a farce
<Dermathil> Ponyraku: no. The big ones are in the equivalent of a monopoly for the hardware
<Jason> maybe you can help me real quick
<Jason> just 1 question
<Spyrorocks> k
<Dermathil> So they saw their money flowing out through those smaller ISPS
<Jason> do you know how to limit the disk quotas of certain users?
<Ponyraku> Dermathil, that sucks arse
<Jason> I am looking to do a dropbox kind of thing
<Dermathil> the CRTC took the side of the big ones and forced the smaller ones to put a cap.
<TheDukeofPony> prince-dari
<TheDukeofPony> dddddd
<TheDukeofPony> twilight best
<Dashite> That's not what happened!
<Jason> and have a mapped drive on the users' comp, and it limits their disk space
<Spyrorocks> that would be implated into the system
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol corporate greed.
<Jason> into the server?
<Spyrorocks> i dont know that sorry
<Jason> :/
<Dashite> The CRTC did side with Bell/Rogers, but they didn't mandate a cap!
<Jason> oh
<Dermathil> Dashite, last news articles I read said they did
<Nittany_Tiger> I guess the only way to escape it is to live in a socialist/communist govt. (maybe)
<Dashite> The fight earlier this year was about usage based billing.
<Ponyraku> Afaik, it's always been based on the speed you want in Finland
<Ponyraku> 3g has been different
<AllisZero> Only way to escape draconic restrictions on what you can and can't do?
<Ponyraku> It started mainly per usage but now uses per speed billing
<AllisZero> Yeah, good luck getting that in a socialist government.
<Nittany_Tiger> One w/o corporate corruption.
<Nittany_Tiger> But then you have govt. corruption.
<Dashite> We did have per speed billing about 4 years ago. The big ISPs started putting caps back in around that time.
<Nittany_Tiger> Anarchy time!
<Ponyraku> Fun fact
<Ponyraku> Internet is listed as a human right in Finland
<Dashite> I recall reading that actually.
<Ponyraku> The ISPs must provide at least a 1mb internet to everyone who wants it
<Nittany_Tiger> I wonder if the US will do that eventually.
<Nittany_Tiger> They did it with telephones.
<Ponyraku> http://i.imgur.com/NbHN8.png

<herospirit> Lol, why? :P
<TrollightSparkle> MantisToboggan, You cannot resist the ponies.
<Trollestia> Also, one can't ignore ponies.
<MantisToboggan> because this one episode and then nothing is driving me nuts
<Ponyraku> MantisToboggan, it's called pony withdraval
<Flaria> You can survive!
<Flaria> We survived the summer, after all.
<Trollestia> You get used to it. Go read some fanfic or something.

<LordCelestia> Hello
<Trollestia> Hello.
<TrollightSparkle> My lord.
<Trollestia> Now we need a non-troll Twilight.
<Ponyraku> Why would you need that?
<Trollestia> Traitor.
<TwilightSparkle> What was that? Couldn't hear you over my name change.
<TwilightSparkle> Trololol
<TwilightSparkle> But seriously..
<LordCelestia> Oh youre too kind :D
<TrollightSparkle> FFFFFFF I can't please everypony..
<Ponyraku> Mwahahahahaha
<LordCelestia> Hey guys, did you hear about that satellite coming towards earth?
<AllisZero> Eyup
<TrollightSparkle> Nope. Tell us please?
<Ponyraku> ee-yup
<AllisZero> How's that going?
<LordCelestia> Theres like a 6.5 ton satellite coming for the earth and we dont know where its gonna land
<Trollestia> I heard.
<LordCelestia> until september 24 or later
<AllisZero> Could crash ANY DAY?
<Rainbow-Dash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=X-QDux8_w0k
<LordCelestia> Any day around Sep 24
<AllisZero> Come on, scientists can do better than that
<LordCelestia> Its moving at 5 MILES PER SECOND
<LordCelestia> thats kinda fast...
<Ponyraku> Well
<Ponyraku> At that speed
<Ponyraku> It's going to burn on re-entry
<LordCelestia> they considered that
<LordCelestia> but
<LordCelestia> NASA confirmed that there are 26 components of the satellite that will most likely survive the burning
<TheDukeofPony> DAAAANGER ZONE
<AllisZero> So why not intercept it with a missile like that last one?
<herospirit> Rainbow-Dash....
<herospirit> FUCK YEAH
<LordCelestia> Idk,
<LordCelestia> This ones going too fasty
<LordCelestia> *fast
<LordCelestia> 5 miles a second? youll need a pretty fast rocket
<AllisZero> Errr
<LordCelestia> and they dont know where it's going to enter our atmosphere. not until 2 hours before it hits
<TrollightSparkle> Wow, 5 miles a second, I heard that right?
<AllisZero> You just need to calculate the angle, if its orbit is somewhat stable
<Trollestia> Lots of flak. :p
<AllisZero> Well thats a problem
<Ponyraku> 5 (miles per second) = 18 000 mph
<LordCelestia> It;s not stable. Like I said, we don't know where it will enter. If it enters over antarctica or something we wont be able to get to it in time
<Ponyraku> mach 1 = 761.207051 mph
<TrollightSparkle> So yeah.. pretty effing fast..
<LordCelestia> It's basically barelling through space uncontrollably
<LordCelestia> We should have like rainbow dash save us or something
<Ponyraku> Assuming you need to match the speed
<Ponyraku> You'd need to go over Mach 23
<TrollightSparkle> I don't think even her sonic rainboom would match the speed LordCelestia.
<LordCelestia> You dare disagree with me?
<LordCelestia> lol just kidding
<TrollightSparkle> I do. >:|
<LordCelestia> but no, her sonic rainboom can top everything
<TrollightSparkle> I challenge you.. to a duel!
<Ponyraku> If we assume a sonic rainboom occurs at the same speed as a sonic boom
<LordCelestia> Trollestia, say "umad" to her
<Trollestia> No, she's done well.
<LordCelestia> ALRIGHT
<Ponyraku> Then no, RBD will not be able to match the speed
<TrollightSparkle> Magic beats royalty I win.
*LordCelestia uses MOON CANNON on Trollight Sparkle. Fatality.
<TrollightSparkle> FFFF
<LordCelestia> I win ^^
<Ponyraku> Since the satellite is moving at Mach 24 and Dash is moving at Mach 1
<LordCelestia> You still have much to learn, dont worry *teleports trollight back to earth*
<Ponyraku> But...
<TrollightSparkle> Thank you very much.
<LordCelestia> Oh. well idk
<Ponyraku> If you don't need to match the speed, just intercept it
<Ponyraku> You could just missile it
<LordCelestia> maybe dashs rainboom has like a 500 mach force behind it
<LordCelestia> :D
<Ponyraku> And we're assuming the satellite won't be slowed down by the friction caused by the athmosphere
<LordCelestia> Alright ill tell you what we'll do
<Nittany_Tiger> Someone should do a comic or cartoon of Past Sins.
<Nittany_Tiger> Whoops.
<herospirit> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOlbLbPLsYU&feature=related
<Nittany_Tiger> Had my chat scrolled up.
<LordCelestia> Trollight, i am Magic Royalty so that makes it 20.5 percent better
<Ponyraku> Dammit Seth, stop forgetting the post titles
<TrollightSparkle> :|
<LordCelestia> We'll take rainbow dash and clone her 500 times. Then we'll have them make 500 sonic rainbooms in space and together their force will be 500 machs of pure energy blasting the fucker to smithereens.

<prince-dari> MFW Rainbow Dash is still just Rainbow Dash.
<Diftraku> :P
<Jigglysaint> Disparity
<TrollightSparkle> Pinkamena Pie.
<TrollightSparkle> I half expected her to actually get her straight mane back, tbh
<RainBroDash> 10AllisZero I know that feel. It's when that feel comes every single week, and you realise that you're playing that game for nothing, and you don't -actually- have fun PvPing, even when you claim that's what keeps you playing. That's when you stop playing. (Personal experience, your experience is subject to difference, however the same rules apply)
<Jigglysaint> yeah kind of a letdown
<Trollestia> It's not Pinkamena. Pinkamena implies deflated mane.
<Flaria> Angry Pie, more like
<TrollightSparkle> >:|
<Jigglysaint> Stinkie Pie?
<Diftraku> oh lol
<Trollestia> Pinkameana?
<Diftraku> Been lurking in steam chat all day
<TrollightSparkle> That sounds better Trollestia
<Jigglysaint> that's when she goes crazy of her own accord
<Diftraku> And the first thing I notice is somepony saying RBD is lesbian
<Trollestia> We have a Steam group?
<TrollightSparkle> Trollestia, yep. Brony Movie Night
<Diftraku> MMO-C Thread one
<Jigglysaint> also ScrewAttack is doing a Death Battle Scarscream vs Rainbow Dash
<TrollightSparkle> I should be back on Steam tonight hopefully..
<Jigglysaint> Starscream
<Trollestia> brb, joining that shit
<Nittany_Tiger> I might be on playing Dead Island.
<AllisZero> RainBroDash: yeah. I've been essentially playing for my guild
<TrollightSparkle> I've been meaning to ask, how is Dead Island Nittany?
<AllisZero> But we're losing a lot of the guys I liked to play with
<Nittany_Tiger> Pretty good.
<TrollightSparkle> I'll be back in about an hour everypony.
<Trollestia> I played RS for the clan. The clan died. I stopped playing. everythingwentbetterthanexpected.jpg
<TrollightSparkle> Bye for now.
<Nittany_Tiger> It has similarities to Borderlands except this game actually has challenge.
<Trollestia> See you.
<TrollightSparkle> Oh wait.
<TrollightSparkle> Trollestia, RS? What's RS?
<Trollestia> Runescape.
<TrollightSparkle> No way dude? I still play that occasionally!
*Jigglysaint huggles Rarity
<AllisZero> My guild's been around since day one of World of Warcraft
<AllisZero> It will PROBABLY stay around till the day the game dies off
<TrollightSparkle> Away time.
<Trollestia> I did some skilling in my time.

<Diftraku> That
<Diftraku> Buck
<Diftraku> I remember when I read it
<Diftraku> And the pic of Dash crying over AJ that had the fic with it
<AllisZero> That one I didn't see
<Flaria> ;________;
<Diftraku> I cried for about an hour or longer
*Flaria hugs Diftraku
<AllisZero> I don't read fics

<Flaria> I know Pinkie's supposed to be the 4th wall breaker
<Flaria> But Lyra definitely spends more time with humans.
<Diftraku> That's the thing
<Diftraku> Pinkie breaks the 4th wall when there's one
<Diftraku> Lyra just doesn't care
<AllisZero> 0Oh god
<AllisZero> 0No
<AllisZero> 0I can't read this
*Flaria hugs AllisZero
<Diftraku> What you mean?
<Flaria> DON'T READ THE SAD D:
<AllisZero> 0Just the comments are leaving a void in my brain
<Diftraku> AllisZero, Circle of Friends?
<Trollestia> Sounds so sad, but I must read it.
<AllisZero> 0Anything to do with the flow of time and how things change going forth
*Flaria is wiping the tears from her eyes
<Diftraku> I must be the most depressed pony evar: it's spreading to the channels I stay in
<AllisZero> 0Just makes me depressed more than anything
<Diftraku> Even though I simply love grimdark, there's been few chapters of FO:E that after I have read them, I just lock up and don't do naything for an hour
<mooponi> dare i ask
<mooponi> whats FO:E

<mooponi> wat
<Diftraku> Yeah, it's long
<Diftraku> Ch37 had 92 pages if memory serves
<mooponi> geez
<Diftraku> Lets put it this way: if you like Fallout and want to read fan fics, read that
<mooponi> i like the premise of fallout
<mooponi> but didnt really like fallout 3
<Trollestia> Back from Circle of Friends.
<Diftraku> I highly recommend reading FO:E
<mooponi> cool
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I don't
<Trollestia> So sad...I feel even more weary now.
*Diftraku gives Trollestia a hug
<mooponi> oh god haha

<FreezeFrame> Why does everyone like writing such depressing fics for FiM?
<mooponi> thats probably my favorite pic
<FreezeFrame> I'll look at it when ponibooru actually loads
<Flaria> ^
<FreezeFrame> Meanwhile, Pandora just pulled up TSO's version of Fur Elise
*Trollestia doesn't see how FO:E degrades intelligence.
<FreezeFrame> And now Therion's version of O Fortuna
*LordCelestia says your argument is invalid.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 cool story bro

<prince-dari> The reactions would be great.
<LordCelestia> I sent my application form back but she hasnt been on here since earlier
<Diftraku> I actually like vinyl with red eyes
<Trollestia> As do I.
<prince-dari> It'd just be funny with all the people saying "OMFG U RERTRED SHE GT READ IES"
<LordCelestia> As am I. wait...
<prince-dari> Then you say "Nope, the eyes are whatever colour you want them to be".
<prince-dari> And they rage.

<Dumori> up**
<Diftraku> danke
<Diftraku> Oh look

<AllisZero> Lol
<Dumori> x3
<Dumori> wait it's drawn by our RobotPinkie? or another
<TheDukeofFail> mass produced robot pinkies
<Diftraku> Today feels like a "Silva Hound - Nightmare Moon" day
<TheDukeofFail> I am listening to the deus ex soundtrack
<TheDukeofFail> sweet, sweet wav files -.-
<Dumori> 19% though back upaprently
<Dumori> still copying pony
<Dumori> why do I have 60gb of pony
<Diftraku> lol
<Dumori> if not more
<Diftraku> I dare not even think how much I have
<Dumori> thats quite a lot
<Dumori> do say I dont save many images
<Dumori> WTF is in my pony folder
<TheDukeofFail> I have the episodes and I have that 26k image torrent that was going around
<TheDukeofFail> but
<TheDukeofFail> and I have pony swag I guess
<TheDukeofFail> but yeah
<TheDukeofFail> other than that I am a terrible brony :(
<Dumori> I have all the episodes 3 times
<Dumori> x3
<Dumori> 720p mp4
<Dumori> 1080p mkv

<Trollestia> I have them in the form they are in from the /pony/ torrent.
<TheDukeofFail> that's just insane ;\
<Trollestia> Mostly 1080p .mkv
<Dumori> well I have 1080 .mvk for my PC
<Dumori> the 720 avi and colour fixed itunes rips
<Dumori> that I transcoded back in to mp4 for my iPhone

<TheDukeofFail> iTunes is a pos
<Trollestia> ^
<Dumori> iTunes is EPIC
<Trollestia> lolno
<Dumori> (for all the wrong reasons)
<Trollestia> Ah.
<Dumori> also its EULA says I can't use it to make nukes
<Dumori> HOW?!
<Dumori> really
<Dumori> how
<Diftraku> lol
<Dumori> also bioweapons
<Dumori> and chemical ones
<Dumori> still HOW
<TheDukeofFail> that's probably apple's default EULA language tbh
<Diftraku> That sucks... I always wanted to make one with iTunes
<TheDukeofFail> maybe Mac OS has it too
<TheDukeofFail> which makes more sense
<Braeburn> Easy Dumori,
<TheDukeofFail> not allowed to use Mac OS to help design weapons
<Braeburn> Your not allowed to use it to view content on how to make them!
<Dumori> yeah I'm temped to make a nuke with itunes in it
<Braeburn> Such as the DIY nuclear reactor
<TheDukeofFail> lol
<TheDukeofFail> Dumori
<TheDukeofFail> missile playing pony tunes
<TheDukeofFail> as it goes
<Diftraku> Fun fact: any EULA that is not in finnish is not legally binding contract in Finland
<TheDukeofFail> last thing anyone hears before it goes off is "WINTER WRAP UP"
<Diftraku> Got to love the law here
<Dumori> kindo' the wrong order
*Dumori moves to finland
<Diftraku> So, because WoW only has an english EULA
<Dumori> that cinches it x3
<Trollestia> CAUSE TOMORROW SPRING IS HERE *nuclear rainboom*
<Diftraku> I'm binded by it in any way
<Diftraku> (hence Microsoft has almost all EULAs in finnish these days)
<Dumori> damn I'm a foal
<Dumori> I poored boiling water over my had earlyer
<Dumori> was fun
<TheDukeofFail> :/

<Dumori> should be though
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Discord knows everything, and he did inform us about who best pony is...
<TheDukeofFail> ah but he said that twilight was the most powerful
<Dumori> Best pony is DJ pony
<TheDukeofFail> he just likes pinkie pie because she's nuts
<RobotPinkie> 06,15His motivations don't matter!
<prince-dari> >most powerful and elusive element
<prince-dari> != best pony
<Dumori> Ok I need sleep I just forgot MY gender

<Dumori> x3
<Dumori> I was raised in the UK
<Dumori> and my lingisic Knowledge is shit
<prince-dari> You ONLY remember Fry from Bones?
<prince-dari> Poor.
<Dumori> I know pidgin German and Japanese
<Dumori> at best
<Dumori> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Fry
<Dumori> has his wiki
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I learned English from... uh... being really weird as a kid.
<Dumori> leant japanese form that
<Dermathil> Dumori: he's recurring Guest star in Bones. That'S where I remember him
<Dumori> also goign there as 5
<Dumori> lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I was kinda obsessive about learning Japanese for a while, too.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15but books on languages are expensive...
<Dumori> lol
*Trollestia is taking classes on it.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Taking Japanese formally next year.
<Dumori> I spent a while in japan as a wee boy
<Trollestia> I'm sick of the subs/dubs debate.
<Dumori> when I was 5
<Dumori> been obessed with it from then on
<RobotPinkie> 06,15...there's a debate?
<Dumori> wait
<Trollestia> Well, argument.
<Dumori> what debate
<Dumori> we where talking about knowing japanese
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Whatever you like best, lawl.
<Trollestia> ^
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I know a fair bit, I guess. Couple of hundred kanji, obviously both kana alphabets.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Not nearly enough to read a newspaper, though.
<Trollestia> I can install programs properly. That's it.
<FreezeFrame> I'd love to learn Vietnamese or Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese)
<WhatPayne> Oh hey I too studied Japanese for six months
<FreezeFrame> Of course, the latter would mean I'd be able to figure out what my roommate is saying on the phone >.>
<Dumori> I can't read it or speak it well
<Dumori> I can understand it spoken
<Dumori> I leanr basic japanese as 5
*Dermathil doesn't know squat about Japanese language.
<Dumori> didn't learn to read it though
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I can't understand it that well spoken, really, though it depends on the complexity.
