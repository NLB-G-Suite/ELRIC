<Jmo> Adam*
<Vivix> Goodnight AdamTheDuck!
<Ninjazz> Nacht AdamTheDuck.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night AdamTheDuck
<Vivix> Hear Thank you for the music by Abba in your head, all night
<twilight_sprinkle> >open EQD
<twilight_sprinkle> >see gangnam style
<twilight_sprinkle> >refer to http://cs309323.userapi.com/v309323180/1609/BErKYZDf-9I.jpg
<Vivix> I saw half gangnam style music video
<Vivix> didn't like it-
<twilight_sprinkle> i wouldve disliked it, but hearing about it every day several times for the last month makes me hate it
<Ninjazz> I like Gangnam Style.
<Vivix> I just don't get the humour in reiterating a music video in various ways
*twilight_sprinkle throws Ninjazz into a a volcano
<Vivix> but meme's and replication has never been my humour, so- whatever
<Ninjazz> Since it's a better alternative to all the rap and hippy hop music that's ALWAYS blasted here usually.
*Ninjazz was the Ring of Power.
<twilight_sprinkle> i like the idea of gangam, but i hate that its promoting pop music like never before
<Vivix> I don't listen to music on bronystate
<Vivix> I like pop, indiepop, hell I like almost everythign as long as it's honest and feels good to me
<Vivix> or feels anything, gangman just feels like a joke, and I don't really like joke music
<Ninjazz> If you've seen the music video, it probably is.
<Vivix> saw half of it yeah, I think it's just for giggles
<Ninjazz> Especially since he yells at a woman's ass.
<twilight_sprinkle> i like joke music, and i wouldve liked gangnam, if it werent so popular because of its simplicity. all its doing is promoting pop music
<Ninjazz> I mean, that was hilarious.
<Vivix> I don't mind it, obviously, but I don't like it or jokes based on it
<CrazyCherry> !ping
<twilight_sprinkle> pop music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTtki7hXC64
<Bronysith> gangnam style is good
<CrazyCherry> Shit
<Vivix> I don't really like jokes in music, some eh exceptions, but I can't remember them at the moment
<Vivix> Throw it on the ground! That was the exception
<Bronysith> its good but i dont like how everyone makes parodies of it every fucking day
<Bronysith> should i get resident evil 4 on the PSN yes or no?
<Ninjazz> Walk by the Foo Fighters has a joke music video.
<Ninjazz> But it actually has a pretty srs message.
<Ninjazz> The song does.
<Vivix> Yeah, those things are okay
<Bronysith> should i buy Resident Evil 4?
<Vivix> I don't really listen to foo fighters, but as long as the song feels good or gives feels
<Ninjazz> Sith, yes.
<Bronysith> well it is on the PSN
<alexxm> bye guys
<Bronysith> so i will bet it
<Bronysith> night alexxm
<Vivix> Bya alexxm
<Vivix> Yeah Parodies aren't quite my style, I'm not a fan of replication-
<Vivix> Of course, not against people doing it, but you know discussing taste is talking, I guess
<CrazyCherry> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEg0TxK-jfM
<twilight_sprinkle> the reason i hate gangam is mostly because it promotes pop, even if it intended to parody it
<twilight_sprinkle> all it did was cement the position of pop above other music
<Vivix> Maaybe- I don't think it matters
<Vivix> I don't think it was a parody either, not sure what kind of group they are
<twilight_sprinkle> it was a parody of mostly korean things, including korean pop
<Vivix> Aah
<twilight_sprinkle> but now that its become a hit
<Bronysith> Gangnam style is good
<twilight_sprinkle> its shit.
<Vivix> I can't even remember it
<twilight_sprinkle> the idea is good, but the music is shit
<Vivix> I like you know some pop music, mostly in the sub pop genre
<Vivix> but- pop is popular music, it will always be, what that includes will change-
<Vivix> wouldn't be the first parody to become a hit
<twilight_sprinkle> i define pop as a genre, not just popular
<twilight_sprinkle> it always involves a simple beat,
<Vivix> well it is a genre, but that genre changes slowly
<twilight_sprinkle> a simple melody
<Vivix> just how rock technically died out in the 50s
<Vivix> but we still call things rock
<twilight_sprinkle> scientists showed that the current pop is the simplest form of pop of all time
<twilight_sprinkle> barely any note variety
<Vivix> probably, danceable requires simple beat
<Vivix> and 5 note melodies are usualyl the easiest to remember, being better for pop
<twilight_sprinkle> music doesnt always have to be dancable
<Vivix> of course
<Vivix> but that is what pop aims for
<Vivix> simplicity
<twilight_sprinkle> i know
<twilight_sprinkle> thats what im saying
<Vivix> you have minimalism, which is even simpler than pop, but is not popular
<twilight_sprinkle> and im sick of it corporate pop crushing all other forms of music on it
<twilight_sprinkle> *under it
<Vivix> well I kinda disagree there
<Vivix> mainly because musicians thrive under and away from pop, removing it would probably--not be a good thing
<twilight_sprinkle> they dont thrive that much
<twilight_sprinkle> they dont have nearly as much money
<RainbowEthan> Hey
<Vivix> Enough to create music
<Vivix> of course, but removing pop would not give the mmoney
<twilight_sprinkle> and young and upcoming artists that arent into pop dont get the chance to be big
<Vivix> if you don't strive to be big, that doesn't matter
<twilight_sprinkle> it does, how many non-pop singers can you name out of the top of your head?
<Vivix> well, many
<twilight_sprinkle> i can only name one who i accidentally saw
<Vivix> mainly because I like messing around in local bands and underground shit
<Vivix> oh you mean solo singers?
<Vivix> Don't listen to that, so wouldn't know
<twilight_sprinkle> well not solo, but singers of music which is focused on voice
<Vivix> A few, I guess
<RainbowEthan> I found more TimeTurners!
<twilight_sprinkle> point is that pop is certainly getting in the way of other music getting the rewards it deserves, as well as thriving
<Vivix> I don't think so
<RainbowEthan> I went looking through the episodes because I saw a rumor that they made even more Doctor Who ponies.
*ASoftFluffyThing pokes the chat
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah its not Preventing it, but its in the way
<Vivix> if you remove pop nothin will replace it
<Vivix> in an artificial way
<RainbowEthan> Turned out they made like six
<twilight_sprinkle> it will be replaced by every other type of music
<Vivix> but why would people who only listen to pop suddenly listen to somethign else?
<twilight_sprinkle> all the freed up space will be enough for many types of music
<Vivix> pop listeners are casual or radio listeners, and such
<Vivix> easy listening
<Vivix> on radio in many countries you get tons of indie artists, unknown singers and artists, groups and such, going big is HARD, going is not
<twilight_sprinkle> like i said, nowadays its not easy to hear music besides pop on the radio, or on youtube, just randomly. so if there were other music it might turn out they like it
<Vivix> maybe- but I dunno, I don't think it's hard to find nonpop
<twilight_sprinkle> idk, mostly i hear pop on the radio
<Vivix> just on the radio I hear crazy shit I've never heard of
<twilight_sprinkle> and on youtube, pop ads everywhere
<Vivix> well yeh vevo only advertises their biggest artists
<Vivix> but when going on youtube to discover music, do you use ads or related?
<RainbowEthan> I pity those who go on Youtube for music.
<twilight_sprinkle> idk, maybe im doing something wrong, but im mostly into instrumental/classical/vocal, and its not easy for me to randomly find music i like
<Vivix> I do it many times, cause many young bands put their stuff there, and live music
<twilight_sprinkle> i use related, but tid oesnt help
<RainbowEthan> Its like trying to navigate through space when all the stars are gone with a flashlight
<twilight_sprinkle> *it doesnt
<Vivix> no- I see your problem there, it's not easy to stumble upon unless you have al ocal radio that specializes in it or--know channels like pandora
<Vivix> RainbowEthan, thaat's true, youtube isn't the best place for findign stuff
<twilight_sprinkle> pandora, ive heard that before, i forget what it is
<Vivix> radio here plays jazz, classical, metal, pop and indie stuff
<twilight_sprinkle> good radio
<Vivix> it's a radio that generates a playlist based on what you write in as your favourite artists
<Bronysith> Resident Evil 4 is 3333 MB to download haha
<Ninjazz> >Jazz
<RainbowEthan> I know, Vivix. I use Rhapsody.
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<Vivix> I liike jazz
<Vivix> and noise-
<RainbowEthan> Its not the best but it has pretty much all the major artists.
<twilight_sprinkle> hm, ill need to check that out
<twilight_sprinkle> im not into jazz, but its good music
<RainbowEthan> Im open to all music except country
<Bronysith> jazz is meh
<Vivix> I like some country, not all
<Vivix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZHwyc26kyk trondheim jazz orchestra
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Vivix> have to see them sometime
<RainbowEthan> Just seems to me like if you do country you don't have MUCH talent.
<Phase4> 00,02looks like the uk government dont like our webhost
<twilight_sprinkle> but pandora isnt as popular as other sites like youtube, and i almost never stumble upon classical/rchestral there
<Jmo> Awwww poor diddum pommies.
<Vivix> Hehe, that may be true
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_qGa4N2CY chat needs more Phoenix Wright OST
<Bronysith> <3
<Jmo> Do they need a tissue?
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: why not?
*ASoftFluffyThing likes H.U.V.A. Network
<Vivix> twilight_sprinkle, it's true, but I don't think removing anything would help us there
<RainbowEthan> Because you just have to stick with generic country music and sing about how your girlfriend left you lying like a log
<Phase4> 00,02https://twitter.com/nfsn/status/254225205298335744
<RainbowEthan> In your river of tears
<RainbowEthan> And she TOOK THE DOG.
<Vivix> Best way to find uncommon music is to search for it specifically, sadly
<RainbowEthan> I wish the artists left Sony and all their records
<twilight_sprinkle> Vivix: it would redirect the advertising business to other types of music, and that would give more variety, thats why it would help imo
<RainbowEthan> And just sold their stuff independantly
<RainbowEthan> At the current rate they get like 30 cents for each album I think
<Vivix> true, but I don't know how effecitve that could be in a nonspecific place
<RainbowEthan> Or each song played
<Vivix> We had classes in school about royalties, licenses, contracts and such
<Vivix> can't remember anything-
<Vivix> and it differs from country to country
<Phase4> 00,02and then i went to bed
<Phase4> 00,02gnight
<Vivix> gnyte
<Jmo> Night Phase
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night Phase4
<CrazyCherry> Night Phase4!
<RainbowEthan> Night
<Vivix> the thing with playing for a big time label is that you can get a steady pay, even if your royalties is low
<twilight_sprinkle> night Phase4
<Ninjazz> Nacht Phase4.
<Vivix> but once you're out, you only got your royalties
<RainbowEthan> Vivix if we left behind Record labels we could have Conventions for music
<Vivix> living wihtout a label is a ton of extra work, but some bands prefer it
<Vivix> some bands don't
<flutterchu> he-hello
<Vivix> I'd prefer a label, cause theres soo much crap to do
<RainbowEthan> If we left behind Record Labels I guarentee crappy singers won't get any more attention
<Vivix> TV and Youtube
<RainbowEthan> But what if the Radio stations directly paid the Artists
<Vivix> Bieber comes from youtube guys
<LightTrooper105> hallo everypony im back o.o
<RainbowEthan> And then got more popular off of a label
<Vivix> well RainbowEthan they kinda do that now in some situations if you are on the royaltie
<RainbowEthan> Well, off of Usher getting him to a label
<Bronysith> damnit
<Vivix> the whole money thing is complicated, and many use a label to--not mess up
<RainbowEthan> But what if the singers and bands dropped labels and a convention was started. Something like Music Independant Festival or something
<Bronysith> i love phoenix wright
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hey LightTrooper105
<RainbowEthan> They could sell Albums on their own websites and stuff
<flutterchu> my leg still hurts i dont think i can run another mile or so
<RainbowEthan> I see your point
<LightTrooper105> hallo ASoftFluffyThing
<Vivix> It's a bit complicated and it depends on the label, you can go to a label that only manages your booking and helps you pay for studio time, or you can get a label that gives you producers and manages advertisement, booking, demands demos
<LightTrooper105> just finish recording several attemps on Hitman Sniper Chanllenge.. feeling like maybe upload on youube
<Syl|Shower> derp
<RainbowEthan> Cool
<Vivix> the more the label does for you, the more money they take from your sales
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349445868763.jpg
<RainbowEthan> Ah.
<Vivix> one weekend in studio can cost as much as 5 000 dollar-
<Bronysith> sandwich
<RainbowEthan> Is that link NSFW Brony?
<RainbowEthan> >.>
<Bronysith> no
<RainbowEthan> Cuz I'm at work.
<Vivix> I know a guy who spent around 100 000 dollars on an album the label rejected
<Vivix> know of*
<RainbowEthan> That is INSANE.
<Bronysith> RainbowEthan: if i linked NSFW i would be banned
<Vivix> yeaah, he told us he ckept the record in a safe, to remind himself of his mistakes
<RainbowEthan> Oh yeah
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o7YzPEtJkk
<RainbowEthan> :D Protection!
<flutterchu> bye
<RainbowEthan> Wow Vivix
<RainbowEthan> That is seriously crazyy
<Vivix> yeaah-
<Vivix> he was making a blues rock album in LA, but by the time he finished the label had decided that--blues rock was over in USA, and refused it
<RainbowEthan> How long did the album take to make?
<Vivix> so he came back to norway a poor man, now he makes music for MTV and plays in a band that does relatively well
<twilight_sprinkle> Vivix: see whar pop does though
<Vivix> well, in some cases yeah
<Vivix> but that's just how marketing is I guess-
<Vivix> had he had a contract before he made the record, they would have to put it out, so he did mess up
<RainbowEthan> Smith that picture was disturbing XD
<RainbowEthan> I thought it was NSFW at first.
<Bronysith> RainbowEthan: its sith
<Bronysith> not smith
<Bronysith> SITH
<RainbowEthan> I call you SITH NOW
<MadSurge> Bronysith, my man! Fancy a game of Breakout with a maiden as the paddle? :D
<RainbowEthan> MY RULES.
<twilight_sprinkle> bronysmith
<twilight_sprinkle> it is canon
<Ninjazz> yfw you called him correctly.
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
*Bronysith locks twilight_sprinkle in a room with molestia
<Vivix> Hehehe
<RainbowEthan> Oh god...
<Vivix> http://youtu.be/XQ6sLAcA84Y heres the guy who lost so much money

<RainbowEthan> kbutsrsly How do I does the emote thing.
<Vivix> Stabfest!
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, aaaaaaah yes. The sad, sad, SAD truth. :<
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi VenHur
<RainbowEthan> STOP STABBING!
<Vivix> it is /me
<twilight_sprinkle> RainbowEthan: /me likes twilight
<RainbowEthan> IT HUURTTTS!
<Ninjazz> T~T
<RainbowEthan> Lies. It does not work, you liarponys.
<Vivix> whaat, what client are you on?
<Jmo> Man you guys are jerks.
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Jmo> Just tell him the truth, jeez.
<twilight_sprinkle> fiiiine
<RainbowEthan> >.> Thank you Jmo.
<Vivix> ;__;
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: but hey, there ARE girls out there that act like hams just for fun :D so not all is lost
<Jmo> The law has been laid down. Zing.
<twilight_sprinkle> to do the emote thing, you need to kill 20 monks on their secret base on the top of everest, then sacrifice their bodies to the blood king, then travel to japan and steal an ancient time-travelling sword that appears once a millenia, then you can use the emotes
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, eeeehhh. Still probably won't match Rarity. :3
<Ninjazz> ... T~T
<Vivix> I like Rarity
<RainbowEthan> ... Someone kill Sprinkle XD
<Ninjazz> Vivix, ME TOO!
<Vivix> I like her snootyness
<Jmo> Some imagination yuo have there.
<Jmo> you*
<RainbowEthan> Now tell me. Now. Before I get angry and go on 4chan.
<RainbowEthan> ... I love you so much 4Chan...
<twilight_sprinkle> RainbowEthan: defeating a food topping, only makes it tastier!
<Vivix> Seriously it shuld be /me, I don't know any other way on IRC
<Jmo> Oh the horror if that happens. How will we do without you.

<Ninjazz> Unless you're using colloquey or something.
<Vivix> Where are you signed in from?
<Ninjazz> Then it might be ACTION
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: but I saw people acting like 'Shy and Pinkie :D I myself am quite chatty once I loosen up
<RainbowEthan> Eh, if it doesn't work then fine
<RainbowEthan> I can live without it.
<Jmo> Or can you.
<RainbowEthan> ... Oh god.... ...
<Vivix> Don't mention the poisoned doughnuts
<RainbowEthan> I'm shaking...
<RainbowEthan> JMO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE.
<Jmo> Sup.
<Vivix> Dying.
<Vivix> U?
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, well, it's easy to act like Flutters and Pinkie. Just act well... shy and act hyper active. Rarity... you need to be likeable while still having that posh, "I have standard" feel.
<MadSurge> He put LAXATIVE in the donuts!
<RainbowEthan> Why, JMO?
<Jmo> Cause I can.
<RainbowEthan> Oh god blurhgbluurghghbutMYBUTTblurghgkbhugh
<twilight_sprinkle> CURSE YOU JAAYMOOOOO

<Jmo> Love you all <3
<Ninjazz> O u jaymoo.
<RainbowEthan> Mah head hurts
<Ninjazz> Vivix, I LOVE her. Her voice started it all for me.
<Vivix> yeaah, I love her voice too-
<Vivix> my top three are actually Rarity, Fluttershy and Pinkie
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: same for RD :D not all tomboys are really into it like her, Applejack's is a more common attitude :P
<Vivix> Dunno why I like Rarity so much, but- yeah
<Vivix> yeah
<Ninjazz> Oh trust me, I know the feel.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vivix: you mean after twilight!
<Vivix> noo sorry ;__; but I still like her a lot too
<twilight_sprinkle> aw fine
<RainbowEthan> My top three are RainbowDash, Pinkie, and TimeTurner, even though he has nothing to do with the Mane Six.
<Vivix> Hehe
<twilight_sprinkle> my list is 1.some purple horse 2. rarity 3. trixie 3.9 woona 4.everypone else 5. fluttershy
<Vivix> I like RD's eh progress?
<RainbowEthan> Stop staring at me creepily Vivix
<RainbowEthan> And pull your pants up >.>
<Vivix> No, it's the way of my people
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, Applejack is hardworking. Also, just because she never lies doesn't mean that she doesn't hide the truth. RD... hmmm. well, I'm on the fence of whether just acting a bit too bold and "I'm the topic of conversation" to pin point what her personality.
*Jmo strokes RainbowEthan
<Jmo> Fear him.
<RainbowEthan> ... Why are you touching me?
<RainbowEthan> ... Help... Someone...
<Vivix> RD is insecure, which makes her a bit brash, but she's also impatient, but you know in hurrican episode you see her pull in her temper and try to understand Fshy
<twilight_sprinkle> o_o
<Ninjazz> Don't question.
<Vivix> shows she's clearly developed since dragon mountain episode

<Vivix> I like how despite cutiemark and element, they are still ponies with emotions, and don't stick by their marks and elements so much that it becomes unrealstic
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: I shuffle between perfect poker face and her pathetic attempts to hide the truth when I try to lie :D
<Vivix> it's just their trait
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I don't hide it. I go FULL ON "I'M LYING!" mode when I lie. Unless, I /really/ need to lie. >_<
<Ninjazz> Kinda like sarcasm, but less caustic. :D
<Vivix> I suck at lying
<Vivix> I get like <,< ..totally not >.> a lie or anything <,<
<Jmo> You're good at touching people though.
<Vivix> That I am
<Vivix> People are soo soooft Jaymo, SOFT
<Ninjazz> "I'm not touching you. >.> <.<"
<MadSurge> Vivix: well, no person is really one sided, nor are these ponies :D
<Jmo> SO VERY SOFT
<Ninjazz> "I'm stroking you."
<Vivix> yeah, and I like that MadSurge, it makes me like them more
<Vivix> Oh Jazz, perfect avoiding the truth thing
<Vivix> Horses are soft too, like a warm velvet rug
<RainbowEthan> Sorry, had to get another chair.
<Jmo> LOL
<RainbowEthan> Mine broke. Had it for three years XD
<Jmo> Getting too excited.
<Jmo> Tsk tsk.
<RainbowEthan> I have like three office chairs just lying around in my office
<Jmo> I blame Vivix.
<Ninjazz> I'm still assuming I'm being referred to as Jazz?...
<Vivix> I broke the chair in my room in college, and by the end of the year you have to take eh inventory, to not pay for damages, and me and my friends stole a chair we found outside, and hid the remains of mine
<RainbowEthan> I used to have other people inside my office, too.
<Vivix> Ninjazz, yeaah, all buddylike
<Ninjazz> Ahhh good. :3
<Jmo> What are people?
<Ninjazz> Miserable piles of friendship, jaymoo.
<Vivix> Miserable Piles of Friendship. Miserable
<Jmo> Ooooo.
<Vivix> Friendship and Sex
<Vivix> that's life, ooo, that's what all the people say
<Ninjazz> One big, bubbling, oozing pile of Friendship and sex.
<Vivix> And that is how life is made
<Vivix> hm..it actually IS how life is made
<RainbowEthan> Well at least everybody stopped stroking me.
*Jmo strokes RainbowEthan
<Ninjazz> In some cases, you don't need the friendship. :/
<Vivix> I was deeply disturbed on the bus from school once, my friend leaned over and said "We've all been in our mothers vagina"
<RainbowEthan> ... Viv... Help...
*Vivix strokes RainbowEthan's eyes
<RainbowEthan> Viv XD
<RainbowEthan> ... WHAT THE HELL.
<Jmo> Yeah you aren't going to win.
<Ninjazz> Better than the other exit, Vivix.
<Vivix> Truuee
<RainbowEthan> Ninja.. Help meeeee
<Vivix> And at least we don't remember it
*Ninjazz calls the Help Me hotline for RainbowEthan.
*Vivix blocked call sound
<Ninjazz> Aye. Dispite people calling it a natutal miracle. It's a pretty traumatic experience.
<pinkiespice> back
<twilight_sprinkle> Hello, this is the Help Me hotline
<twilight_sprinkle> Sorry, we are currently on lunch break, try calling again later.
<Ninjazz> natural*
<pinkiespice> yes, help me hotline. ;A;
<pinkiespice> why!
<Ninjazz> RainbowEthan, i tried.
<RainbowEthan> WHY IS EVERYBODY TOUCHING MEEEEE
<pinkiespice> I need help ;A;
<Ninjazz> :p
<Vivix> Ninjazz, yeaah, I don't think I want to watch the birth of anyone-
<Jmo> Cause we can.
<RainbowEthan> -Curls up in a ball sobbing hysterically-
<Vivix> Touching is fuun
<pinkiespice> *Comforts RainbowEthan by patting his head
*Vivix comforts by stroking his hair
<Ninjazz> Vivix, I mean, if it was my son or daughter, then yeah... But if I was like a guest, i'm pretty sure I'd be one of those guys that'd faint on the spot.
<Vivix> Ninjazz, hehe, true, true
*Ninjazz talks about child birth like it's a spectator event.
<Vivix> A friend of mine decided that if she were to ever have kids, she would adopt, because birth sounded so traumatizing to her
<Ninjazz> "Yo, man, I just wanted to see your child's birth!"
<RainbowEthan> -Turns insane and urinates on Vivix to escape-
*Vivix revels in pee
<DashWithRainbows> ...
<DashWithRainbows> Well...

<ASoftFluffyThing> Agreed, DashWithRainbows.

*ASoftFluffyThing slowly walks away
<RainbowEthan> ... Just to clarify they made me do it...
<DashWithRainbows> I blame Saxy.
<Vivix> Let's all blame Saxy
<RainbowEthan> I blame the calling center...
<Jmo> Good enough.
<RainbowEthan> ... Yeah, Saxy!
<Ninjazz> Always blame sxy.
<RainbowEthan> NOBODY LIKES YOU SAXY
<twilight_sprinkle> RainbowEthan: but we were on lunch break!

<DashWithRainbows> I don't see why you keep saying that Nobody likes me when that individual does.
<pinkiespice> wow

<Ninjazz> His jacket's badassery.
<pinkiespice> I been listening to a finial fanasty music for 2 hours now
<MadSurge> DashWithRainbows: he even blinded a cyclops once!
<RainbowEthan> This has been the most fun I've had in IRC since that time I went onto a random IRC channel,
<RainbowEthan> And did nothing for four hours
<Vivix> Hehe, this can be a very fun place
<Ninjazz> Welcome to ponychat.
<RainbowEthan> When nobody is stroking me its fun
<Ninjazz> Don't spam 6 messages in under 10 seconds and you'll have a good time.
<RainbowEthan> -Inches away from Vivix for safety-
*Jmo strokes RainbowEthan
<MadSurge> Pony fans are alovely bunch aren't they :$
<DashWithRainbows> Nope.

<pinkiespice> Barbetos|AtWork: The joystick kind of joystick, the one you play videogames with
<Jmo> You have BBC, point is invalid.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Still wrong
<Ninjazz> DWR, actually I LOVE rainy weather. Doesn't sound like a bad idea.

<DashWithRainbows> Because I enjoy licking the tears of crushed dreams.
<Jmo> Eh Chris was alright.
<Ninjazz> You evil, snarky brit.
<Ninjazz> You're alright.
<RainbowEthan> Tennant was nice.
<Vivix> In many ways
<RainbowEthan> He really made it seem REAL.
<DashWithRainbows> I may be evil and snarky...
<RainbowEthan> The emotions he displayed...
<Jmo> Tenannt was best doctor.
<Jmo> :<
<adasdad> eccleston was my favorite.
<RainbowEthan> Indeed.
<DashWithRainbows> Jaymoo, that is a lie.
<RainbowEthan> Why did he have to leaaaave.
<Vivix> I only saw Tennant, and even then only 3 episoodes
<DashWithRainbows> It's Matt Smith.
<Jmo> DWR PLS.
<Jmo> ikr.
<RainbowEthan> -Stabs Dashwithrainbows in the eye-

<Vivix> DWR is reading this chat with audio reader
<Barbetos|AtWork> DashWithRainbows: are you computa?
<DashWithRainbows> Silly Rainbow-E-Fan.
<Ninjazz> He has feelers below his fancy moustache.
<RainbowEthan> -Rips his eyeballs out-
<adasdad> smith really plays the doctor well, but i like eccleston because he came before all the constant drama and angstyness.
<RainbowEthan> BROTHER
<Ninjazz> Whoa whao whoa.
<Ninjazz> Yo, man.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Whoa whoa
<Barbetos|AtWork> WHOA
<Ninjazz> I'd hate to be THAT GUY.
<Ninjazz> But read the damn rules.
<RainbowEthan> Smith is good but Karen really hindered him.
<DashWithRainbows> Barbetos|AtWork I'm not a robot. I'm a sentient piece of toast.
*Barbetos|AtWork eats dwr
<Jmo> tbh, Doctor Who is going downhill.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I am smart now
<RainbowEthan> Who was that directed to, Ninjazz?
<DashWithRainbows> D:
<Ninjazz> DashWithRainbows, do you go good with jam or jelly?
<Saturn> RainbowEthan: lies and slander
<Ninjazz> RainbowEthan, unfortunately, you.
<DashWithRainbows> >Jelly.
<RainbowEthan> I'm getting heavy lag and my IRC client is lagging to no avail
<DashWithRainbows> Ahahaha
<Saturn> smith's character is terribly written
<DashWithRainbows> No.
<DashWithRainbows> Saturn is nekkid
<RainbowEthan> Good >.>
<Ninjazz> So jam then?
<Saturn> i'm nekkid
<Saturn> wiat what
<RainbowEthan> Smiths character is incredibly simple
<Jmo> No surprise.

<Ninjazz> RainbowEthan, you are RPing DWR's non-existant eyes out.

<Lil_B> I really like this DORK PMV , the colors at the beginning and the end are really good to let the video loop :)
<demoman> DashWithRainbows: THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!!!

<Vivix> like pastel rainbow
<adasdad> Dark92Enigma: i don't accept your apology, because i have no idea what you're a pologizing for. attempting to explain it would be useless, sso don't.
<Ninjazz> Or do it Phase4 style and odd a blue BG to the text.
<Vivix> Dark92Enigma, naming your dog?
<Dark92Enigma> adasdad: From where i come from, ''adasdad'' means random, so i giggled a bit, that's all :(
<Vivix> helt kompliitli rændåm
<Dark92Enigma> Vivix: no, the breed, she has none....therefore, i'm trying to find the word
<adasdad> Dark92Enigma: that's... actually very fitting for me. huh. k then.
<Saturn> 8,1okay, i'll switch back to normal colours
<Vivix> oh a bastard?
<Dark92Enigma> Vivix: NOPE.
<Ninjazz> I was just getting used to the rainbow pain.
<mentallyeffedguy> what u guys talking about?
<Saturn> 8,1taste the painbow.
*ASoftFluffyThing hugs Saturn
<Vivix> we sometimes call it gatemix, when dogs have no one breed
<ASoftFluffyThing> The rainbow is delicious
<Vivix> good dogs, if the mix is nice
<CrazyCherry> Saturn: Rainbows!
<Saturn> 8,1actually, yellow is probably my least favourite colour
<BladedWings> Saturn: whats a painbow?
<Ninjazz> I smell irony.
<Saturn> 8,1i like blue more
<Dark92Enigma> Vivix: The word i'm trying to find is ''a mixture of breeds''
<BladedWings> Dark92Enigma: a mut?
<Vivix> Hm. don't know any other english word for that
<mentallyeffedguy> Ninjazz: since when did irony get a smell?
<Dark92Enigma> BladedWings: i think that is
<Vivix> I think bastard and mut is only I've heard
<Saturn> 8,1but my OC (and colour no BS) is yellow because my favourite moth, the Comet Moth, is yellow
<Saturn> *on
<Ninjazz> mentallyeffedguy, ever since it was so obvious, the essence of it carried an almost... frutti tutti aroma.

<Stormy> Nope
<Kimori_Breakfast> ill be a bit idly, cooking
<Stormy> I already have a really good grade in that class so I don't really care about it at all
<Stormy> Okay
<Kimori_Breakfast> Yeah no worries then :]
<Vivix> What did you buy the joystick for? Flyin'?
<ASoftFluffyThing> OOh, pretttty
<Wrek> 05aye
<seatsea> hi everypony
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi seatsea
<Lil_B> I remember back when I playd Teewars, first step each time console:>bind k to kill
<Invi> hi seatsea
<Vivix> I used to bind kill in half life, to not let people get score for killing me
<Vivix> "I'm dying! hit q!
<Lil_B> hey seatsea
<Kimori_Breakfast> SR sort of disappeared last night
<BladedWings> hi seatsea
<Lambduh> Sup
<Stormy> yeah he used to do that a lot
<Stormy> weird he didn't come back though
<Stormy> hey Lambduh
<Lambduh> Hey
<Stormy> SR probably won't be back for another two weeks now XD
<Lil_B> and my current Motherboard can only support DDR2 :/ back to constructing a new one :/
<Kimori_Breakfast> ._. seriously
<Lambduh> Nah, he'll be back
<Lambduh> He just won't talk
<Invi> you construct a new one?
<Stormy> he has a habit of disappearing without telling anyone
<Stormy> Really pissed me off when we were friends
<Kimori_Breakfast> When he turns his laptop on he will probably come back but yeah he wont talk at all
<Lil_B> well, I build myself a new PC is what I ment XD
<Invi> aw ^^
<FlutterTree> wut
<Vivix> DDR2?
<Vivix> Ah well, luckily new mobos aint too expensive, but sometimes you have to replace so much other things
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
*Vivix eats trout, then bites Jmo
<Lil_B> I'll not make a Processor with a soldering iron and build everything from scratch XD
<Stormy> I'll need to leave for class pretty soon I guess
<Stormy> starts in 13 minutes
<Kimori_Breakfast> alrighty
<Wrek> 05ok
<Kimori_Breakfast> dont freak out before the test :P
<Invi> why? ^^
<Wrek> 05most controsl bound
<Wrek> 05problem is that soem keys stick
<Stormy> haha, I won't
<Wrek> 05and suddenly i wotn stop turnign :|
<Ninjazz> What game you trying to get running, Wrek?
<Lil_B> Vivix yeah :/ mine will get costly, I can't really cheap out on anything, I need a good Prozessor+RAM for working, a decent grafics card for gaming, and a good Soundcard to properly hear music :/
<Wrek> 05playign planetside 2 configuring my joystick for flying
<Ninjazz> Oh. OH NICE!
<Lil_B> Invi well, I think a 4 Bit Processor that needs 100Watt to run would be a possibility XD
<Vivix> Lil_B, yeah, same here. With music I chose to go for much ram and CPU- worth it in the end
<Lil_B> Vivix yeah, same Idea for me, hopefully this November/December
<Sonny> Heya everypony! :D
<Vivix> 800 watt, 16gb ddr3 eh 3.4ghz i7 2600..260 GTX I think (not sure will check)
<Lil_B> hey Sonny!
<Sonny> Is The_Engineer online, is he is he??
<Sonny> damnit
<Sonny> to alte again :/
<Sonny> late* >_>
<Vivix> 670 GTX
<Sonny> thanks Lil_B :)
<Lil_B> I need some help to determen how much Watt I need, I basicly sitting in front of the PC the whole day after school, the weekend and the holidays :/ and I don't wanna cause any larger Electicity Billds :/
<Vivix> well it only pulls what it needs, as far as I understand
<Lil_B> Vivix that's a really good System :)
<Vivix> so I run 800 watt- just in case
<Vivix> Thanks
<BladedWings> hi Sonny
<Sumica> 00,10Guess i should log in and watch wrek crash alot
<Sumica> 00,10wreks wrecks
<Vivix> wrek's wrecks wrecked the rec'
<Sylandest> ^
<Lil_B> Vivix yes, normally it should do this, but sometimes it thinks "well... I could go that high... I don't really need to but I'm going to anyway" XD
<Sylandest> say that 5 times fast
<Vivix> Ah yeah, true
<Vivix> Hehe Sylandest iimpossible

<Lambduh> Arr
<Sylandest> Lil_B: :O :D
<Vivix> I am pretty bad at guessing how much power you need, but I guess the graphic card will give you a good indication, and you pop maybe 100 watt over that
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hello Sumica
<Lil_B> hey Sylandest !
<Stormy> talk like a pirate day were last week maties, arr
*Sylandest huggles Lil_B

<SafariMonkey> Ryunosuke: Puling?
<SafariMonkey> Oh hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good morning everyone
<SafariMonkey> Afternoon! :P
<Ryunosuke> many people forget to set up thier controllers in thier os first, that results in hilarity :)

<SafariMonkey> What are flying controls?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hello GabeMoist
<BladedWings> wb Sonny and hi GabeMoist
<Ninjazz> Are you switching from mouse to joystick whenever you pilot?
<Ninjazz> Hey GabeMoist, TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
<SafariMonkey> BladedWings: I can't recognise Sumica's voice yet. :P
<DaringDerpy> not much activity on this server
<SafariMonkey> Is it mouse based tilt like crysis?
<RainbowEthan> Hey
<Ninjazz> Oh mai.
*Gunthler licks Ninjazz
<Gunthler> >_>
<Ninjazz> Ohh.. kay?
<RainbowEthan> Hey Ninjazz.
<SafariMonkey> Does the x/y control roll/pitch?
<RainbowEthan> -Copies Gunthler-
<Ninjazz> Hey Rainbow Ethan guy.
<Jmo> Ethan is a muffin, not a guy.
<RainbowEthan> I am a Muffinman
<SafariMonkey> I meant the way you're using it. Thanks for the reply
<RainbowEthan> Borrred.
<MadSurge> I like you, Ninjazz! You're way less grumpy than Meanwhile :D
<Ninjazz> Well... Pretty much anyone is less grumpy than Meanwhile, you know... He's Brit. And I'm a Murikan. I jus don't got the snark.
<Ninjazz> Wrek, forgot to crop. It's ZOOMED.
<RainbowEthan> Ninjazz is secretly a duck
<Ninjazz> Wut.
<Ninjazz> All good.
<RainbowEthan> Ninjazz, ADMIT IT.
<Ninjazz> I will do no such thing.
<RainbowEthan> You feathered FIEND.
<ImOkayWithThis|ZzZ> Ninjazz is a Jazzy Ninja.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: well Saturn, Chrysalis and GilDash are from there too, but they're not grumpy :D
<SafariMonkey> Wrek: roll is turn around the forward-backward axis(move left-right), pitch is turn around left-right axis(move forward-backwards), and yaw is turn around up-down axis (turn around)
<Ninjazz> That I will admit to.
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, you have a point. Though I shall concede and say I appreciate the fact that you like me. :3c
<RainbowEthan> -Stabs Jazz.-
<RainbowEthan> I always hated music...
<Ninjazz> \(-_-)/
<ImOkayWithThis|> Jazz isn't that bad enough to deserve a stab...
<Gunthler> :3
*Gunthler dances on Ninjazz s head
<Gunthler> :3
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: not that I hate the other chatgoers, mind you :D
<SafariMonkey> Wrek: Sorry to confuse you with my terminoligy
<SafariMonkey> *terminology
*Ninjazz has a dancing creature on his head.
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, oh I wouldn't think that. But I don't get the phrase "I like you often".
<Purple`Prose> Hi everypony.
<Ninjazz> Actually... I do...Hmmm.
<Ninjazz> Hey Purple`Prose.
<BladedWings> hi Purple`Prose
<DashWithRainbows> College work is done, how is the joystick holding up, Wrek?
<RainbowEthan> |(o.o)--<|----D Shovel?
<SafariMonkey> Wrek: So does it stick?
<Purple`Prose> Out of curiousity, anyone have any idea what the Wonderbolts outfits are made out of?
<ImOkayWithThis|> Haiyo esorP' elpruP
<SafariMonkey> Wrek: Can you increase the deadzone?
<GreasyEthan> I did it...

<Purple`Prose> ah

<SafariMonkey> Wrek: I mean is the physical stick sticking or is it the sensor?
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: it's just that sometimes I like telling people I like them just for being there and being themselves :D You either have to be very slimy or an asshole to be hated by me :D
<FlutterTree> MadSurge: i shall do my best to earn that award
<[OC]ShadowQuill> Hello, my friends!
<SafariMonkey> Wrek: Deadzone is the area which is counted as centered
<GreasyEthan> Hello, Shadow.
<GreasyEthan> ... Im so greasy
<FlutterTree> hello [OC]ShadowQuill
<[OC]ShadowQuill> Has anyone begun the clans yet?
<SafariMonkey> Wrek: Flight sim?
<GreasyEthan> Clans?
<GreasyEthan> Oh, nametag clans?
<MadSurge> FlutterTree: you don't like me? :(
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, welp. I appreciate it all the same. And don't worry, I'm pretty sure my moods isn't that bad that I'll be anywhere near a jerk.
<GreasyEthan> Is that what [OC] is?
<[OC]ShadowQuill> [OC] is the clan for the ones that have their OC for names. We should start doing this
<FlutterTree> MadSurge: no, im just gonna make you, not like me :D
<Jmo> >_>
<GreasyEthan> And who leads this "clan"?
<Jmo> LOLCLAN
<MadSurge> FlutterTree: :P
<GreasyEthan> ... If Jmo does it I'm in.
<GreasyEthan> ... Jmo do it.
<[OC]ShadowQuill> No leaders, just make up a clan and put it before your names. It's great fun!
<MadSurge> Also holy shit Ninjazz, I think my inner Pinkie came out on that paragraph :D
<Jmo> I'd rather go play with toy soldiers.
<GreasyEthan> -Stabs Jmo-
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I actually have to agree. ^_^
<Jmo> Oh hush you.
<Ninjazz> And holy shit, MadSurge, you still cool. :3

<SafariMonkey> Sorry for confusing you like that Wrek. :/
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sup
<BladedWings> hi SpadeMagnes[School]
<SafariMonkey> yo Spade!
<GreasyEthan> Stream was overrated anyway \(>_>)/
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Apperently a live action Halo movie is in the works...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I got a ad for it on youtube
<GreasyEthan> Metal gear is in the works too
<SafariMonkey> GreasyEthan: You take that back!
<FlutterTree> bye
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have my doubts
<Jmo> And so is MLP Movie.
<BladedWings> bye flutt...aww
<GreasyEthan> No, Monkey
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The history with video game movies is not so good
<GreasyEthan> Eat a platypus
<SpadeMagnes[School]> See Mario Bros for example
<GreasyEthan> Mortal Kombat one was okay.
<ImOkayWithThis|> Haiyo [loohcS]sengaMedapS!
<SafariMonkey> So is Ender's Game movie!
<GreasyEthan> The original one.
<GreasyEthan> They should make a Slenderman o- I take it back
<GreasyEthan> That would be terrible.
<GreasyEthan> ... Oh god why...
*Jmo strokes GreasyEthan
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Didnt the guy who played "bowser" in the mario movie say he didnt like it?
<GreasyEthan> -Enjoys it-
<Jmo> NOW you enjoy it?
<GreasyEthan> Yes.
<Jmo> Bollocks to you.
<GreasyEthan> I always enjo- Dammit...
<Bronysith> hello cakesniffers
<GreasyEthan> My Smith
<GreasyEthan> Your back
<GreasyEthan> My little Smithy
<SafariMonkey> hi Bronysith
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Have any of you guys heard of or played Mischief Makers for the N64?
*SafariMonkey openly admits to sniffing cakes.
<SafariMonkey> Hi Chrysalis
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[School]: yup
<GreasyEthan> -Admits to sniffing Monkey-
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I swear you need a fucking guide for some of those gold gems
<GreasyEthan> His name was weird
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also despite my belief you could not, I was able to catch fireballs among other things...
<GreasyEthan> ...
<GreasyEthan> Silent chat...
*Jmo slaps GreasyEthan around a bit with a large trout
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Anyhoo...back to watchign Deceased Crab play the Chzo mythos series
<GreasyEthan> -Enjoys it and licks Jmos ear-
<Jmo> Who the hell are you and what have you done with Ethan.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How old is the N64 anyway?
<Jmo> 14 years?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Mine still works
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Gets tiny bits of slowdown in some games
<GreasyEthan> I'm...
<Jmo> 16 years*
<GreasyEthan> A DUCK
<Jmo> Close enough.
<GreasyEthan> QUACK QUACK
<GreasyEthan> Kbutsrsly I stuffed his body in the closet
<GreasyEthan> With Molestia
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So how is a n64 able to last so god damn long but consoles now adays die fairly easy?
<Jmo> :<
<Jmo> It's due to the hardware.
<Ponymatic> N64 is pretty solid state.
<Ninjazz> Because back then, people took pride in their console construction.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Since it still works how much would a N64 and a collection of games go for?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have stuff like Paper Mario, OOT,Majoras Mask...
<GreasyEthan> He was the Dovahkin
*Jmo slaps GreasyEthan around a bit with a large trout
<GreasyEthan> Jmo will you save Ethan?
<Jmo> NOP
*Ponymatic should look into an N64 emulator. ;)
<GreasyEthan> -Creepily rubs Jmo's ears-
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Apperently Banjo cameoed in Diddy Kong racing befor he even had his own game
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And Conker's origional...less darker form was in it too..
<Jmo> I'm warning you, I'm Australian.
<GreasyEthan> I love you, Jmo...

<Jmo> or maybe that's jsut me.

<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXrymV-Lgtw&feature=related
<twilight_sprinkle> well, numbers dont easily finish people, thats true

<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: the more people vote for it the bigger choice of it winning too
<Rustymeat> dammit I want the next walking dead episode to come out already

<DashWithRainbows> Seeing I'm older than him,
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well one I dont get out much, seeing as I lack a job or car...and two I dont live near a movie theater
<Jmo> You aren't even spiderman bro.

<Jmo> Lawl
<DashWithRainbows> Just put Daru, Matt Smith, David Tennant and I in the same room.
<Ninjazz> Lol.
*SpadeMagnes[School] starts teleporting around
<Jmo> Oh that'd be something I'd pay to watch.
<DashWithRainbows> If M.S. isn't dead in 1 minute of the door being closed while Daru flirts with D.T.
<DashWithRainbows> Then we are not brothers.
<Jmo> Seems legit.
<Ninjazz> And Dabi will do that in span of one minute? o_O
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Gee sure is boring around here
<Jmo> Wouldn't be surprised.
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: you forgot an "it" :D

<Dark92Enigma> Cold
<DashWithRainbows> The Shizuka is a magnificent creature to observe. Whilst it yawns from it's slumber, it will then go on the hunt for something to eat,most likely some baked goods or will try to find the nearest source of wubs. For reasons we can not explain, the Shizuka has a natural close friendship with the creature known as the VioletVanilla, or more commonly known as the Vivi. Seeing that the Shizuka
<DashWithRainbows> has a interest for wubs, this is a small factor as to why they are very good friends.
<Dark92Enigma> you're cold
<DashWithRainbows> Have a text wall :3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> WALL OF TEXT
<Shizuka> 13croikey
<Dark92Enigma> kicked out again, and it says 127
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Vinyl?

<Dark92Enigma> alexxm: Stone Cold's promo?
<DashWithRainbows> Documentaries of mods will be a small yet fun thing for me.
<SirGanjalf> Gummy?
<MadSurge> Oh no Shizuka!
<Chrysalis> Shizu how come?
<Jmo> tl;dr

<Dark92Enigma> I named her LUNA!
<bronyxia_coptureclas> hi everypony
<Kimori> doing alright
<Kimori> you?
<Vivix> Cute name for a dog
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: dont forget to send her to the moon
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im pretty sure the chat exploded when Derpy is mentioned...but ok then...
<Cades> same
<Vivix> it did, man did it
*Jmo pats Vivix
<Vivix> well when she spoke anyway-
*Vivix gives Jmo offering of 1 derpy
<Dark92Enigma> SpadeMagnes[School]: then you haven't seen the 2nd season finale,
<Jmo> WOOP DERPY
<Invi> it did. there is even a video of the bronystatechat on youtube
<Dark92Enigma> I still love Derpy, though
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I've seen it..
<Vivix> I saw it here
<Vivix> but eh
<Vivix> I wasn't on the chat
<Vivix> since I had it on bigscreen tv
<Invi> me wantz 2 screens...
<Vivix> I generally don't chat until episode is over anyway
<Wrek> 05back
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Is there ever a show where royals actualy do anything? All the shows I see, royals dont do anything helpful
<Shizuka> 13a wild wrek appears
<Vivix> most shows yeah they don't
<Vivix> but we rarely see a royals job in real life too so meh
<bronyxiacoputerclass> Sup everypony
<Wrek> 05ok so
<Wrek> 05beta is beta
<Wrek> 05the joystick is wonky

<Wrek> 05gona unplug it for now
<Vivix> aww
<Wrek> 05who's up for more gamin?
<Kimori> am about to head out actually, have a couple of things to do
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure
<Alchemist> good evening guys!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Good old tv tropes
<Jmo> 'ello Alchemist
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wrek I think part of the issue is that they are too focused on keyboard and mouse at the moment, and the sad part is that a plane would be way easier for precision with a joystick
<Shizuka> 13this sounds like a job for shizu the not-really-a-pyro-and-not-very-good-at-close-range
<XylemTube> Hi
<emangamer> are we playing TF2 now?
<Chrysalis> wrek, on PS2?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Shizuka: There are flame throwers in PS2 =P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It may just be petty reasoning, but I really dont like Celestia sometimes..
<Shizuka> 13yeah but they're stupid expensive
<MadSurge> Heyo Alchemist!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ugh. Araxium is so hard to get.
<Barbetos|AtWork> At least release will ahve more of the junk
<SpadeMagnes[School]> 15% for what?
<Vivix> I adore canon Celestia and Luna, based on the tiny parts we've seen, but- I like that kind of people
<Barbetos|AtWork> I have to admit I really like the NC weapons in Planet Side 2 more than the first one.
<Alchemist> I just did some measurements with an instrument that I have no idea what it actually does...
<Chrysalis> my god ps2 loads so nicely on an SSD
<Shizuka> 13derp..
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Huge percentage jump
<Shizuka> 13tell sumica i have to take care of something quick >>
<Shizuka> 13also mfw 3k certs
<DashWithRainbows> Noice.
<Barbetos|AtWork> You get 5k certs every day

<ASoftFluffyThing> Anybody know how to get a nick to ping in the main chat in HexChat?
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'm trying and it's not working so far.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Did they change the hud or is that an option Wrek ?
<MadSurge> I come back, and hi Meanwhile :)
<Meanwhile> Heh, quadsquad.
<Ninjazz> Interest for this game is steadily rising.
<DashWithRainbows> Wait for when it is a full release.
<DashWithRainbows> It will be F2p.
<Jmo> I'd rather not.
<DashWithRainbows> Well
<Ninjazz> Oh gawd yes. Now if only I had a machine to run it on. :<
<DashWithRainbows> Shaddap Jaypoo.
<Jmo> luvu2dwr
<DashWithRainbows> Ew, gay.
<Jmo> Keep thinking that
<DashWithRainbows> I will.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You know how you can tell if your computer is powerful enough? Try running Crysis
<Jmo> lolcrysis
<DashWithRainbows> Ninjazz I know that feel. I brought Alpha squad for this, can't run the game but still, it was worth the £30.
<DashWithRainbows> Turns out if you buy AS, you get a bonus code for a friend.
<DashWithRainbows> Gave it to Fluttercry.
<Ninjazz> Nice. Good man. Still painful.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> All these maps seems like its really easy to snipe people
<DashWithRainbows> Well, I hope to get money for my custom soon.
<Ninjazz> I got to save up for college/uni. And that's /IF/ I get out of fucking Highschool.
<DashWithRainbows> Ah.
<Ninjazz> Goddamn math.
<Jmo> No money for you DWR.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I dread college
<DashWithRainbows> If you lived in England, you pay for College if you are above the age of 19.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My brother is STILL paying for his college and he's been out for awhile
<DashWithRainbows> Joomay, how so?
<DashWithRainbows> Did you steal my mooney again?
<Jmo> Cause you spend it all on tea.
<DashWithRainbows> Lies.
<Jmo> maybe I did.
<Jmo> :>
<Ninjazz> I'm 18, that means... if I somehow moves to Angle Land next year or so, more expenses.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well he went to marquette but anyway...

<Ninjazz> Wut? No bread jokes?
<GabeMoist> I'll butter you up Ninjazz
<Jmo> You aren't Toast.
<DashWithRainbows> Yes I am.
<Ninjazz> I'm not Toast, GabeMoist!
<Jmo> No you aren't.
<DashWithRainbows> My nickname IRL is Toast.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lol why?
<Randomnerd> http://i48.tinypic.com/dgj5mt.jpg
<Jmo> NO.
<Jmo> I LOVE TOAST.
<Jmo> It can't be true
<Randomnerd> Sorry, there it is.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> That has to be the weirdest nickname ever
<Randomnerd> I ran into this guy at the Renaissance Festival :D
<DashWithRainbows> Because I was late to a class in year 8 and I was holding 3 sliced of toast from home.
<DashWithRainbows> Walked in and ate it while everyone stared at me.
<DashWithRainbows> It was weird.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Like a boss.
<DashWithRainbows> Yet delicious.
<Jmo> How is that even weird.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why does alot of stuff in life sound fun, but then it becomes hell?
<Ninjazz> That's alot better than the names I've been given.
<DashWithRainbows> Imagine if you were teaching P.E. and you see a student walk in the middle of your lesson, late and eating toast.
<Jmo> I'd find it humorous.
<Ninjazz> I'd lol.
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: trees are getting bloodthristy?
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'd laugh at the fact that they're calmly eating toast.
<DashWithRainbows> I have brought in pizza, ice cream, noodles and some other things into lessons.
<Jmo> What a cool kid.
<DashWithRainbows> I know right?
<DashWithRainbows> So kewl.
<Purple`Prose> The Happening
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The movie was retarded
<DashWithRainbows> yet so gangsta at the same time.
<Ninjazz> But would you really want to be called Icey, or Pizza, or Noodles? Toast rolls off the tongue well.
<BladedWings> DashWithRainbows: too thug lol
<DashWithRainbows> I didn't choose the thug life...
<DashWithRainbows> Because I have some intelligence.
<DashWithRainbows> :l
<killerpony7733> ^
<BladedWings> :D
<Jmo> Bollocks to you DWR.
<Jmo> You chose it.
<DashWithRainbows> I'm not a chav.
<Jmo> Psshtt
<DashWithRainbows> I just live amongst many of them.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I will never understand Yolo
<DashWithRainbows> Ninjazz Noodles reminds me of one of the monsters in RE5.
<Ninjazz> DashWithRainbows, I ALREADY which one. >_<
<SpadeMagnes[School]> DashWithRainbows: the Uroboros monster?
<DashWithRainbows> I think it was the one you have to get in a furnace.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> theres two of those
<Jmo> I'll put you in a furance.
<Ninjazz> Yeah. Freaking slimey things everywhere.
<DashWithRainbows> and kill with the assistance of a flamethrower later in the campaign.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The furnace one and one you kill with a Kil Sat
*LadyCanary giggles.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *Kill Sat
*Ninjazz didn't know there was any Ghosties to giggle at.
<DashWithRainbows> jaymoo I'll put you in a microwave.
<Jmo> pls do
*GabeMoist chortles
<DashWithRainbows> kaykay
<ASoftFluffyThing> Wat?
<MadSurge> LadyCanary! :$
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I found it funny it took the word of the makers of RE5 for people to believe Wesker is actually dead for good
<LadyCanary> Hey.
<Jmo> Microwave time woop
*Ninjazz forgot which monster is affected by chortles.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Betrayle
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: ghoulies? :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> the ghoulies might grab you
<Ninjazz> I don't know! It's been too damn long since I've heard the song.
<LadyCanary> He mad.
<DashWithRainbows> When I'm capable of playing this game
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Calling now, he gets booted
<Jmo> Which is never.
<DashWithRainbows> All I will do is follow Wrek until he lays down his mines
<IshPonyPony> ohai pony ponies
<DashWithRainbows> and try to teabag as many as possible.
<Jmo> Creative.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What is the point of teabagging
<Ninjazz> Hey Ish.
<DashWithRainbows> Humilation.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> its so immature
<BladedWings> hi IshPonyPony
<Meanwhile> It entertains 13 year olds.
<Jmo> Immature?
<DashWithRainbows> It's quick to do and is a taunt to your enemy.
<Jmo> My god what are you doing on the internet.
<IshPonyPony> SpadeMagnes[School] because n00bs can't triforce
<Ninjazz> It marks your territory.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Only thing I find more stupid than teabagging is Yolo
<Ninjazz> It's dominance thing.
<Ninjazz> It's a*
<DashWithRainbows> Mai gawd, y dunt u shuddap, Joomay?
<Jmo> y dnt u?
<DashWithRainbows> because I'm wellard.
<Jmo> MEH
<Meanwhile> Yeah that was quite nice.
<Jmo> Find it funny you said that, Wellard is in my state.
<Jmo> Ironic.
<DashWithRainbows> lolwut
<DashWithRainbows> Is it full of chavs?
<Jmo> Wellard, Western Australia.
<Jmo> How am I suppose to know. >_>
<Jmo> I don't travel the state checking for chavs.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Seriously who was the idiot who came up with YOLO
<DashWithRainbows> I'm sure it was Sith.
<Meanwhile> Entirely possible.
<DashWithRainbows> Being that it is annoying.
<DashWithRainbows> It's a high chance it was 'im :P
<Ninjazz> Bwahahaha.
<Meanwhile> Reminds me, heard Gangnam Style on the radio earlier.
<DashWithRainbows> oh god
<BladedWings> what!? no way Meanwhile

<Jmo> Zing.

<Ninjazz> As a Brit, you sure are.
<Ninjazz> Snarks.
<Purple_Edge> hmmm "do not troll" on what line does "having fun" spring over to "trolling"?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How am I in a bad mood, you know what...nevermind
<Meanwhile> When you're intentionally trying to grief instead of trying to have a laugh.
<DashWithRainbows> Unless you're Daru.

<aspest> Meanwhile: it is very flowered
<DashWithRainbows> Dat is the way of DWR.
*ASoftFluffyThing pats Jmo back
*BladedWings hugs ASoftFluffyThing "no, dont go, i need something to hug" :)

<Keir> Working yourself Saturn?
<taoumi> stuffing a blank white unicorn
<Purple_Edge> taoumi that sounds soooooo wrong
<Saturn> Keir: should be, but instead i'm watching the Leeds Piano Competition
<sonicdude558> taoumi that better not be Celestia...
<Saturn> current finalist is playing Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 5
<Ninjazz> Lol.
<Keir> It streaming somewhere?
<Purple_Edge> that sounds like it could be coming straight from /mlp/ xD
<Ninjazz> SumiLaugh.
<Saturn> not that i know of, Keir
<taoumi> i don't know what it's going to be sonicdude558 but it's not celistia. worng patern
<sonicdude558> ok

<Saturn> grown up sweetie belle
<sonicdude558> so I herd u like ChanServ Bronystate :)
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, glorious. It's a lvl up of his usual chuckle.
<taoumi> hmmm could be Saturn. i'm not sure if i want ot make a filly patern. or jsut shrink the legs on the normal one
<Purple_Edge> so about these "theaters".... whats the difference between the TS-Theater and the RD-theater for example...?
<Saturn> oh oh oh! do fleur de lis!
<Purple_Edge> didnt find anything in the FAQ
<sonicdude558> !eightball
<sonicdude558> aww
<taoumi> could do that Saturn but i would need to use the alicorn patern for that
<Saturn> aw
<sonicdude558> !calc
<Saturn> but she's a unicorn
<Ninjazz> Why can't I hold all these botcomands?
<MadSurge> Purple_Edge: it's to divide people during livestreams of pony episodes
<killerpony7733> Purple_Edge Nothing more of a main chat diversion so theres not purely chatting in manechat
<taoumi> but she uses and alicorn body type
<Saturn> do we even have a bot in here?
<sonicdude558> wait a second... these are all OP commands! I should've known! :[
<Saturn> i don't think we do
<Saturn> not a publically callable one, anyway

<Cades> hey guys

<Purple_Edge> still managing to hear stuff though
<SpadeMagnes[School]> LEEEEROOOOOOOOY
<Purple_Edge> did he just really flew a helicopter str8 into the ground?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He intended to take people out with it
<Kimori> hi Cades

<Purple_Edge> man you scared me there
<Purple_Edge> i read tHanks for nothing guys
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I love how you can shove a tank out of the way with brute force
<LadyCanary> HORSE!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The camera is sort of making me dizzy with it going all over the place...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Achivement Horse?
<Purple_Edge> yeah totally not unfair 1v1.... tank vs human
<sonicdude558> Kaboom there goes a tank
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Tank kills wraith
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Tank kills Hunter!
<sonicdude558> Haunter
<sonicdude558> :3
<FlaschenJoe11> guys, I just finished Crysis again today. I needed to lower the Graphic settings from High to Medium, so my PC wouldn't freeze during the final Boss.
<sonicdude558> lol
<Purple_Edge> everytime i hear wraith i instinctively think of a pale ghastly ghostfigure with claws...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Again Crysis is the ultimate test of computer power
<sonicdude558> I guess that final boss was your computer
<sonicdude558> :)
<FlaschenJoe11> Purple_Edge: You thinking Stargate Wraith?
<Purple_Edge> na dat wraith has armor
<Purple_Edge> im talking about the general description of the mythical beast wraith
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Uh oh Sumica is cackeling
<sonicdude558> yo yo yo Sumica
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The wraith I was refering to was the Wraith Tank
<Purple_Edge> yeah thought so
<Purple_Edge> would be strange to see a pale ghost in a scientific multiplayer FPS
<Purple_Edge> yet not impossible
<SpadeMagnes[School]> God how can you not get slightly disorented with the way the camera goes in the vehicles?
<Purple_Edge> i think the camera is cool
<Purple_Edge> especially when its inside sometanks ass
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Wut
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh my god JC a bomb
<Purple_Edge> im reffering to the bugs...

<Alchemist> ugh, I dont think I will wait for the movies tonight. I feel like crap.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So why was TF2 made F2P?
<Dken2021> hey there Lil_B and LadyCanary
<Purple_Edge> so i can play it
<ekips> because hats
<MadSurge> Wrek (the current streamer) likes games and drawing art, Sumica likes games and anime, and so on
<Lil_B> Alchemist hello :) haven't seen you in a week :)
<Purple_Edge> and because fckn hats
<Invi> hai Alchemist ^^
<Lil_B> and hi ekips (so many people suddenly Oo)
<Blako> I'm fine, except that moment when I was about to throw my laptop out of the window
<LadyCanary> Everyone is getting sick
<MadSurge> Purple_Edge: ^ping :D
<LadyCanary> :9
<LadyCanary> :(
<Purple_Edge> ping wut?
<Alchemist> Lil_B: Hi! Yes, I've been busy lately, and sick too.
<ekips> I'm playing PS2 at the moment, lurked an hour for now in chat :P
<Invi> hay ekips, what level are you actually? ^^
<Purple_Edge> i cant read my ping in chat oO
<Purple_Edge> why you want my ping?
<Blako> there is some problem in C++ I cannot solve
<Dken2021> oh, we're watching ghostbusters for A? neat
<Amu-chan> Now why would you do that? Not co-operating or something?
<ekips> Invi, don't ask
<Alchemist> Lil_B: I hope you are doing fine though :)
<Invi> :D
<MadSurge> Purple_Edge: the message before that one, read it :D
<Blako> very serious problem
<Purple_Edge> ah ok
<Purple_Edge> im fine with everything
<Amu-chan> Not sure throwing your laptop will solve much but a minor sense of satisfaction while watching it fly out the window.
<Blako> :D
<Purple_Edge> brony gamer that watched animes (changed to mangas though)
<Blako> I know
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Gah that camera...going everywhere
<Lil_B> Alchemist yeah I'm fine, although schoolö is killing me :/ I hope I won't have to repeat this year... even though it just started, but so far things weren't going so well :/
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Derp
<Purple_Edge> im happy im out of school <.< hated it
<Cades> haha, just take a break and come back to it later
<Dken2021> looks like ded
<Purple_Edge> im happy as a programmer^^
<LadyCanary> Fook.
<Invi> Purple_Edge, I just leftz school and now I have to attend a vocational school :(
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I would Kerbal mutliplayer would be...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So much chaos
<Amu-chan> Sometimes it's better to step away for a bit and come back with a fresh mindset.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *wonder
<Blako> good idea
<CCCP> hi
<Purple_Edge> ahhh
<CriticKitten> One disadvantage to teaching math?
<Alchemist> Lil_B: same here. I skipped quite many seminars already because the research Im doing requires me to make base solutions at the university then travel an hour to the hungarian science academy because they have the instruments...
<CriticKitten> You know when you're being screwed on pay.
<Invi> Purple_Edge, do you program RPGLE? :D
<Purple_Edge> vocational school is a school that prepares you for the apprenticeship for a job?
<Purple_Edge> i think?
<Invi> indeed it is
<Dken2021> Purple_Edge yup
<Purple_Edge> na.... PHP java html mostly... even though i also learned COBOL
<Lil_B> Purple_Edge I'm "out of school" too, but I'm, in sdchool again to become a Technichian in the fiel of chemistry
<Invi> what is COBOL?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So how do you know if your playing properly if theres no way to "Win" this game?
<Purple_Edge> technician in the field of chemistry?
<Purple_Edge> you gonna get da cyborgs
<Invi> hehe
<Purple_Edge> COBOL is the second oldest programming language.... is procedural and involves a looooooot of text
<Invi> lol
<Lil_B> although I would have preffered Programming or Computer Science, but there is 0 chance to learn that around here :/
<AJIsAwesome> Hello, everyone. How are you all today? :)
<Dken2021> so this borderlands I assume?
*CCCP hugs AJIsAwesome :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Hey Aj
<Dken2021> hai AJIsAwesome
<Purple_Edge> like 2+2=5 is in cobol CALCULATE 2 AND 2 SUM or somehow like that... been a while
<Invi> I'm happy i got one of the only programmer jobs around here... I have to drive 100km a day though
<Lil_B> Purple_Edge Chemichal technical assistand actually... has not much to to with technic actually, just normal chemistry :/
*AJIsAwesome hugs CCCP SpadeMagnes[School] and Dken2021 :)
<Dken2021> no wait, don't think it's borderlands
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I played alot of Mischief Makers last night
<Purple_Edge> oh ok.. my mother worked as a (chemichrist?) once
<Stormy_> =/
<Purple_Edge> dont know how its called
<Purple_Edge> man theres the word "christ" in it... that sound sso wrong
<Flyboy> whats this then?
<Dken2021> a christian chemist?
<Cades> haha
<Alchemist> Lil_B: this is the desk I got at the uni to make the solutions: http://i.imgur.com/Xvvtl.jpg
<Stormy_> My phone is being stupid
<Purple_Edge> na in german its "chemiker" and i dont know how its in english... wait gonna go to translate.google
<Purple_Edge> "chemist"
<Invi> chemistrayter? :D
<Alchemist> Lil_B: and this is the instrument I have to travel for every goddamned day: http://i.imgur.com/1Ghgi.jpg
<Purple_Edge> yeah sounds.... easy
<Invi> oh yeah, chemist :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I miss my Kirby 64 game...
<Purple_Edge> kirby 64?
<Stormy_> ...seriously, how hard is is to stay connected over wifi?
<Purple_Edge> get an N64 emulator
<Purple_Edge> and download the game
<LadyCanary> Poyo \:3/
<Dken2021> yea Alchemist, yea science!
<CCCP> hi LadyCanary
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Or I could get the Kirby collection
<Lil_B> Alchemist man, these pictures are big, and my connection is currently very slow again, gonna take a short while to load :P
<Amu-chan> Sometimes connections are evil like that...
<Bronysith> d
<Alchemist> Lil_B: and I though my phone makes crap pictures :D
<LadyCanary> More voices.
<Purple_Edge> "you should not run at people with guns"
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Betrayed!
<Purple_Edge> the more you know
<Cades> oh my god haha
<Dken2021> yay friendly fire
<CCCP> http://media.cleveland.com/plain-dealer/photo/9896462-standard.jpg
<Amu-chan> I used to deal with that all the time with a cheap wireless card.
<Purple_Edge> hawt cheesus?
<Purple_Edge> i want some
<CCCP> all dem bloons
<Lil_B> Alchemist well... I don't wanna sound mean, but you can get a 2Megapixel picture in really bnad quality if the lense setting isn't good :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im never sure if Kirby is adorable or terrifying
<Stormy_> Maybe it's the app's fault
<LadyCanary> ....He is.
<CCCP> both
<LadyCanary> That is all.
<Purple_Edge> kirby is an evil pink blob that eats every living being it comes across to gain its power
<Purple_Edge> its a fckn demonspawn
<Stormy_> Auugh wtf
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He commited mass genoside BECAUSE HIS PIECE OF CAKE WAS STOLEN
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Do not fuck with Kirby
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *cide
<LadyCanary> Correction: He is an adorable pink puff from the stars and he wants to save everyone by eating everything.
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<LadyCanary> And he says POYO :3
<Alchemist> Lil_B: well, there arent that many options to select on my phone besides the scheme (meaning portrait/night/scene etc setting)
<Purple_Edge> >implying the digested things in his innards can be rescued
<CCCP> how do we know Kirby is a he?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Now that I think about it..why the fuck did the Squeak Squad steal his cake anyway?
<Dken2021> on the outside, he looks cute and child-like mentality, but kirby is the most darkest videogame character ever
<LadyCanary> Because they're a group of thugs, SpadeMagnes[School]
<Purple_Edge> you jokin? mario is the most evil
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also kirby seems to cause more problems than he helps
<Stormy_> Okay, let's see if that fixed it
<Purple_Edge> he is overweight... breaks everyones neck.... destroys every building... takes shrooms... shoots fire
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He unleashed several eldritch creatures
<Dken2021> Purple_Edge ever played kirby 64? know shiver star? It was earth after a nuclear fallout
<Stormy_> Sorry for all the quit messages guys
<LadyCanary> ....Mario isnt overweight =_=
<LadyCanary> WARIO is
<Amu-chan> No worries.
<Purple_Edge> no i never played any kirby :D
<Cades> haha no worries
<Purple_Edge> you ever played wario land 3?
<Lil_B> Invi wow, 100km ... If I would have choosen a radius like this I might have found a place... put well... Maybe I'll switch iin the future if chemistry isn't my style (althoug I do like it) ... I'm 21 when I finish this apprentenceship and about 25 when I'm done studying, I still have plenty of time to do everything I want... god pless our education system :)
<Purple_Edge> wario is the good guy
*Stormy_ glares at androirc
<LadyCanary> ...WREK PLS <3
<Invi> LadyCanary, just because he eats Waluigis food >.>
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How many times has DeDeDe been good?
<Lil_B> / text wall end]
<Purple_Edge> wario works his ass off to get the treasure from the evil guys.... then he gets the treasure and mario comes with a helicopter and fckn steals it after the last boss
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: The first game?
<Dken2021> well good in his own standards
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He was good in Nightmare in dreamland...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Good as in he wasnt a dick
<Invi> Lil_B, 50 kim hin unn 50km zurück ^^
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: What about 64?
<Invi> Lil_B, and Chemistry is awesome ^^
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I found it funny the first person kirby asumes stole his cake was DeDeDe
<NewSuperBronyU|Zzz> 11,02What about 64? o3o
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Me too. :D
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: :O
<SpadeMagnes[School]> also the boss room seemed based on the anime
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: You're supposed to be asleep. :P
*NewSuperBronyU glomps AJIsAwesome
<Purple_Edge> heard about o3o but well
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02sleepies tiem is over :3c
<Purple_Edge> i dont have a N64 never had
*AJIsAwesome glomps NewSuperBronyU :3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02\:3/
<Purple_Edge> was PS1 guy
<DashWithRainbows> NewSuperBronyU Well just look at the time!
<DashWithRainbows> It's time for bed!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02ikr O3O
<DashWithRainbows> :3
<LadyCanary> Good morning NewSuperBronyU :3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02What? D:
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I still wonder what Zero is supposed to be in the Kirby universe
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02LadyCanary: Chirp ^-^
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Intergalactic demon?
<LadyCanary> Tweet tweet :3
<Dken2021> kirby's conscience?
*LadyCanary flies over to NewSuperBronyU and nestles in his mane.
<Purple_Edge> do you remember when the chat was quiet for 2 minutes? petridge farm remembers....
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I'm broadening mah foreign language background /)u(\
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Mah head feels funny now O.O
<Lil_B> Well... I think Dedede was only a Jerk in Dreamland 1, Gourmet Race, and the Kirby Golf Game... every other games he was mostly just possessed ... (or wanted to safe the star rod from Kirby in Kirby's Adventure)
*Lil_B glomps NewSuperBronyU
*NewSuperBronyU hugs Lil_B back :D
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02NiGHTS into Dreams... is out today on Xbox 360 \:D/
<Purple_Edge> nights into dreams?
<Purple_Edge> what genre is that?
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: Nice.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Purple_Edge: Fun O3O
<Lil_B> wasn't it out like 10 years ago on the Saturn?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Yesh
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Actually
<DashWithRainbows> NewSuperBronyU Your funny feeling head is not from those cleaning products.
<DashWithRainbows> Nope.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,0215 years ago :)
<DashWithRainbows> Not from them.
<AJIsAwesome> I still need to get SA2 Battle. :O
<Lil_B> even better :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also the reason Meta Knight wanted to take over dreamland was horribly butchered
<ImOkayWithThis|> Haiyo NewSuperBronyU!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hai ImOkayWithThis| :D/
<Lil_B> OCRemix made an Album of Night Intro Dreams last year... but it was extremly repeditive in my opinion :/
<Purple_Edge> well i was just buying some games today... 4 to be exact...
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I'm going out for nomz O3O
<Purple_Edge> with one of them i will destroy any piece of logical thinking i have left in my brain
<DashWithRainbows> No drink?
<ImOkayWithThis|> Cya NewSuperBronyU.
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, NewSuperBronyU. :3
*NewSuperBronyU leaves while still carrying LadyCanary in his mane
<DashWithRainbows> I disapprove of this.
<MadSurge> Bon appetit NewSuperBronyU! :P
<Purple_Edge> bye
<Purple_Edge> i think my brain wont be the same after playing saints row 3...
<Dken2021> ooh, he got you there Wrek
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I do hope the next kirby game brings back stuff like Leaf and Water
<Lil_B> Alchemist your laboratory looks a little bit older than the ones I've seen so far :P buit you use the same Keyboard as our School :O
<Lil_B> I#m still waiting for the Collectiion to come to Amazon in germany >.<
<Purple_Edge> WAIT i just came across an interesting thought...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> At least I still have Mists of Pandaria to occupy me
<Purple_Edge> about 70% of all of equestria is female .... 2 ponies are needed for one foal....
<Purple_Edge> so 30% male means
<Alchemist> Lil_B: well, the university is broke and we use archaic methods and materials, and the other picture with the pc and the instrument is NOT at my university, its at the national science academy which granted me permission to use the instrument.
<Stormy_> They're playing Friday on the school radio station
<Purple_Edge> every male has to make more than 3 kids .... or the ponyrace will die
<Stormy_> XD
<Dken2021> Purple_Edge there was a comic explaining this
<Invi> Purple_Edge, but in canterlot, almost all the guards are male
<Purple_Edge> really?
<MadSurge> Purple_Edge: don't bring logic in cartoonland :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I do it anyway
<Cades> lol
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Majorly for faults in logic
<Stormy_> Partyin' partyin' yeah!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Like Celestia sendins 6 mortal ponies to get rid of a dragon with out any fucking guards....
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *sending
<Invi> well they are the elements of harmony
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Magic doesnt do shit against a dragon
<taoumi> if i had a spniper rifle. i would win
<Invi> elements > guards
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: You sure about that?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> he got a no-scope no-scope ~
<Purple_Edge> taoumi: >implying dragonscales arent tough as shit
<Alchemist> SpadeMagnes[School]: what good the guards were at any time during the show?
<taoumi> it
<taoumi> 's a song
<Lil_B> Alchemist oh, understandabale, school usually don't have great equipment, my school is in the middle of renovations (the first since the 70's ... at least the walls were colorful --.-) and we now have some nice new rooms to do our chemistry work :)
<taoumi> called if i had a sniper rifle
<Invi> SpadeMagnes[School], it's equestria, where Vendigos come and kill everything when you are a bitching around >.>
<LadyCanary> Pew pew.
<XylemTube> Hello guys
<Purple_Edge> i think the guards are less defending equestria against evil superpony problems....
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, XylemTube. :)
<Invi> hay XylemTube ^^
<Purple_Edge> i think they are more like the ponypolice
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Yes... be happy or else shit goes wrong
<Purple_Edge> ponyce!
<XylemTube> This game looks fun
<Applejack2012> hio
<Applejack2012> hi
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so Shizu is playing planetside too ?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Equestria! Happiest place around...
<MadSurge> Purple_Edge: exactly, the goddess sisters are the big cannons
<Purple_Edge> well if they would move their ass for once
<Purple_Edge> if the problem is little... its get shoved off to the guards...
<Purple_Edge> if its medium it gets tossed to mane 6
<Purple_Edge> if its extreme they aint do shit cause elements > princesses (watch discorD)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And all those times Celestia did jack all to help
<Alchemist> And what does the (demi)goddess do?
<Purple_Edge> she rules
<MadSurge> Purple_Edge: they were in a one-day vacation :D
<Alchemist> Purple_Edge: if she rules, what does the mayor do?
<Purple_Edge> i mean celestia didnt even TRY to solve the ridle with the elements... she just left
<Keir> mayor :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have a intense hatred/dislike for Celestia, because she never fucking does anything
<Alchemist> :D
<MadSurge> Purple_Edge: she thught it was obvious :D
<Keir> Wow shes just like Obama! ... sorry had to say it.
<Purple_Edge> the mayor is pointless since the diversion of might is only common in legislativ , executive and judicative
<Purple_Edge> since that isnt canon in equestria since its a dictatorship
<Purple_Edge> the mayor is only a speaking point to the princess
<Alchemist> technically its a theocracy
<MadSurge> Purple_Edge: the mayor is the local law representative
<Dken2021> *whispers* it's a cartoon, don't overthink it...
<MadSurge> Also ^^^^^^
<Purple_Edge> youre right.... she once ordered some guards around
<Alchemist> Dken2021: I know, just having fun :)
<AJIsAwesome> Dken2021: Exactly. :S
<Purple_Edge> but a mayor shouldnt have the right to order guards around
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And the one time she does anything she gets her ass handed to her...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> No wonder I like Luna more...
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: I like both princesses equally :I
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Purple_Edge> its funny to overanalyze things of cartoons and discuss
<Dken2021> true
<Applejack2012> I love both too
<Dken2021> it is fun
<Purple_Edge> lets walk into another theme.... magic in nonpegasi....
<Alchemist> for all this time I thought that someone was standing besides wrek and it was a goddamned jacket all along :D
<AJIsAwesome> Alchemist: Really? :D
<MadSurge> Alchemist: :D
<Alchemist> yes...
<Purple_Edge> the portals and porting and spawning of items and foretelling of immediate reactions....in other words: pinkie pie
<AJIsAwesome> Alchemist: It's okay. :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also Earth ponies have super strength more than other ponies right>
<MadSurge> Alchemist: the other one talking is Sumica silly
<AJIsAwesome> Purple_Edge: Pinkie secretly has hidden portals all over Equestria.
<Purple_Edge> in case of portal emergency
<Purple_Edge> i know
<Dken2021> it is assumed SpadeMagnes[School], at least to balance them out
<AJIsAwesome> Purple_Edge: Well, I wasn't going to say that.
<MadSurge> Also insane skillz at growing crops
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Applejack in the iron pony competion is a hypocryte then
<Purple_Edge> but you obviously made a reference to season 2 episode 23 i think
<applejack`> me?
<applejack`> ah
<applejack`> xD
<Applejack2012> RD can demolish a barn and Rarity lifted Tom
<Purple_Edge> was it 23?
<AJIsAwesome> Purple_Edge: Unintentionally. :S
<SpadeMagnes[School]> If she gets to use her strength, then she bitches about rainbow using her wings
<Purple_Edge> its 20
<Purple_Edge> season 2 episode 20
<Purple_Edge> just looked
<Applejack2012> While earth ponies moves trains all day all night
<Purple_Edge> damn 3 episodes off
<AJIsAwesome> Purple_Edge: I was talking about how she's able to pull things and be anywhere out of just plain nowhere.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Its pinkie pie dont question it
<Purple_Edge> yeah .... where do the portals come from?
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: well, AJ has strong legs, but it's RD that has strong forelegs. Ergo, flying is HAAAAX
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Doesnt matter
<soulrider95> MAGIC! I aint gotta explain shit.
<Purple_Edge> maybe she made a portal to get a portal gun from portal but where did she get a portal to portal?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> If APplejack can use her earth pony strength RD should be allowed to use her wings
<Purple_Edge> yo dawg i heard you like portals... so we put portal in a portal so you can port while you port
<Applejack2012> PP suddenly used portal up at Spike's birthday
<Purple_Edge> she has a portalgun
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Again, Its Pinkie Pie dont question it
<MadSurge> Purple_Edge: or offscreen teleportation skills :D
<soulrider95> Purple_Edge: PP is a portal gun.... Directed by M. Night Shamalan.
<Purple_Edge> na you get them on level 50... shes 44...
<Purple_Edge> she cant have it
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbfldku5yN1r8uiq6o1_1280.jpg DAN VS IS BACK BABY
<thelonepony> hi everypony :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They never really explain why Cerberus left his post
<Purple_Edge> that sure is an interesting comic
<Purple_Edge> he got bored
<alexxm|colt> internet derped
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, thelonepony. :)
<Dken2021> haai thelonepony
<Applejack2012> hi
<Purple_Edge> or he stepped in one of pinkys portals
<Purple_Edge> since they are stashed all over equestria
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He's supposed to guard Tarterus...WHY WOULD HE LEAVE
<Applejack2012> humans in Equestria!
<thelonepony> hi AJIsAwesome Dken2021 and Applejack2012
<thelonepony> :)
<Purple_Edge> inb4 balls
<Alchemist> SpadeMagnes[School]: maybe they can elaborate a bit more on tartarus in s3
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: Dan VS is second best show on the hub :)
<Purple_Edge> i have another question that is a little more interesting... this will be a little longer post
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What is in Tartarus anyway?
<StinkomanFan> Hi guize!
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, that's nice to know
<thelonepony> hi StinkomanFan
<Dken2021> hey StinkomanFan
<Alchemist> SpadeMagnes[School]: personally I'd love to see a bit more lore added and world building. I'd be very interested in the origins of discord for example.
<Purple_Edge> tartarus explained through the greece mythology is the place beneath hell where the eviliest of evil reside... he guards it... means... something must have took his attention and encouraged him to leave
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, StinkomanFan. :)
<AJIsAwesome> Purple_Edge: Exactly.
<Purple_Edge> this happening would have been mostly be caused by a prisoner from the prison
<Purple_Edge> so when tartarus left
<StinkomanFan> Oh boy, I hope my picks win for next Movie Night
<Purple_Edge> he most likely would have left
<Purple_Edge> BUUUUUTTTTT
<Purple_Edge> he didnt
<Applejack2012> hi
<LadyCanary> Kalimah? o3o
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So..Ponyville is.. STATIONED NEAR A PRISON FOR EVIL
<Applejack2012> hope my picks wins too
<Purple_Edge> or chrysalis and the changeling nation were imprisoned in tartarus and escaped of it to come back in 5 episodes later
<Dken2021> Purple_Edge hate to plot before you, but you're thinking the changelings were the reason it left it's post?
<Purple_Edge> would fit into the timeline
<Dken2021> oh, nmv
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is everyone buying planetside or just finding beta keys ?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The fuck was Celestia thinking when they gave those settlers that land?!
<StinkomanFan> I voted for Vertigo and Saw
<Purple_Edge> OH SHIT!
<Purple_Edge> i need to inform the princess.....
<Alchemist> SpadeMagnes[School]: I had low real estate value. She was happy to get rid of it :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Ponyville I used to think was a great place to live...now...not so much
<Purple_Edge> wait wait wait..... so the changelings got divided all over equestria after the expecto patronum that shining armor + cadence casted....
<Purple_Edge> they should be imprisoned in tartaurs...
<CrimsonPhoenix> British_people.gif
<Kimori> aww
<SpadeMagnes[School]> If they survived the flight Purple_Edge
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpcj9x0TKT1qa601io1_500.gif
<ASoftFluffyThing> eeeeh
<Purple_Edge> does that mean celestia will get a witchhunt on changelings started
<Purple_Edge> to hunt and bring them back to tartarus?
<Kimori> Anyone play Metroid Prime 3?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Back
<Cades> nope
<thelonepony> wb ASoftFluffyThing :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Most of them most likley died from impact
<Purple_Edge> its mlp
<Purple_Edge> no one dies
<Purple_Edge> not even granny smith
*ASoftFluffyThing hugs thelonepony
<Amu-chan> I haven't even played Metroid Prime 1 or 2.
<thelonepony> :3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Correct me if I'm wrong but did Celestia put Discord's statue back where it was before?
<Purple_Edge> i bet there will be an episode where granny smith dies....
<Applejack2012> Hearts and Hooves Day funeral and bones in A Dog and Pony Show
<Purple_Edge> wasnt shown spade
<StinkomanFan> Granny Smith's been dead for months.
<Alchemist> the only character who dies in mlp so far is the bloke whose funeral the cmc crashes :D
<Blako> I don't even know that Metroid Prime exist
<Purple_Edge> just him standing there in ponyville as stone.... and celestia giving the mane 6 the starwars treatment
<StinkomanFan> AJ, Big Mac, and Applebloom just won't admit it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have to ask.... why would you keep the statue of a creature who cast the world into chaos..AND NOT DESTROY IT
<Purple_Edge> alchemist it could be a testrun for an actual burial
<Purple_Edge> maybe the coffin was empty
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[School] seems kinda un sportsmanlike
<Alchemist> Is it possible that the statue was just a sculpture and discord just took it's form?
<Purple_Edge> because hes the GOD! of chaos
<Purple_Edge> and gods are immortal
<Applejack2012> S2 happily ever after ending Discord turned to stone :D
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: smashing the statue will only release him.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well the seal would have broke eventualy
<Kimori> Its just a game for the Wii
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Maybe he's immortal just like Celestia and Luna and he can't be killed?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They could have banished him to the moon or sun or something
<StinkomanFan> Maybe they could take Discord's Statue and bury it
<Applejack2012> to the moon!
<Purple_Edge> we dont know if the princesses are immortal or eternal
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[School] like that worked before
<Amu-chan> *Metroid Prime 3 is a game for the Wii, the first 2 were on the GCN.
<Purple_Edge> there is a difference
<J_E_Smith71> Heading out for my walk. Be back during BMN. I'll be 10-15 minutes late as usual
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Considering tthat he can teleport at will, I doubt that.
<Purple_Edge> discord definitely is immortal
<Alchemist> StinkomanFan: Duscord can teleport I think.
<Dken2021> alright, seea J_E_Smith71
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I doubt he can teleport out of space
<Purple_Edge> i most likely think the princesses are eternal
<thelonepony> cya later J_E_Smith71
<FrostedPony> Happy Friday everyone
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[School]: he probably can, tis magic
<Purple_Edge> another reference from s2 e 20
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi FrostedPony
<thelonepony> hi FrostedPony :)
<Dken2021> happy friday to you too FrostedPony
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi FrostedPony
<Applejack2012> hi
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, FrostedPony! :)
<Purple_Edge> frostedPony throwing out the big references
<MadSurge> Hey FrostedPony!
<Dken2021> hehe, he killed the medic
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also the fact one tiny argument set him free seems stupid
<FrostedPony> is this FPS starcraft?
<Cades> ah
<StinkomanFan> Spoilers: On December 23rd 2012 Celestia will arive and try to teach humanity about friendship
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Maybe the seal was about to break anyway
<Purple_Edge> i wouldnt call it ceal
<Purple_Edge> seal
<Purple_Edge> i would call it "sleep"
<Dken2021> FrostedPony iirc, it is Planetscape
<StinkomanFan> ...Fifteen minutes later she just nukes humanity and moves on
<Kimori> no metroid fans I see :P
<Purple_Edge> dont you wake up when a pan of bacon is fried right next to you?
<FrostedPony> StinkomanFan, I shall begin preparing for the coming of Celestia
<twilight_sprinkle> celestia deliberately put a weak seal on discord so that he would be freed and the mane 6 would have to fight him. she is putting them through tests to make them stronger, so one day she may steal their power
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I'm still hinging on the thought that the CMC should be punished for releasing the god of chaos
<twilight_sprinkle> then she will rule as eternal empress
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Hmm. How should they be punished?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Same for Snips and Snails for bringing a fucking Ursa Minor into town
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Juvie?
<StinkomanFan> And how would Celestia get there powers?
<Purple_Edge> celestia doesnt have control over the elements so ... a test needs to have a result that can also be emulated by the testgiver
<StinkomanFan> Eat there hearts or something?
<Purple_Edge> if twilight wouldve failed....
<AJIsAwesome> Doubt there's juvie in Equestria.
<Cades> I haven't played it, so I don't know if I like it
<Purple_Edge> discord would be unstoppable....
<twilight_sprinkle> StinkomanFan: and brains
<Bunny_Striker> WON MY FIRST FB GAME LAS T NIGHT!!!!
<Purple_Edge> means it was no test
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im not a hearless bastard to have them killed. but they should be punished for almost destroying equestria
<AJIsAwesome> Bunny_Striker: Nice. :)
<Kimori> The series started on the NES
<Lil_B> well, have fun all with the Movies (especially the B-Movie ... it can be kinda Goofy as far as I remember it) ^^ see you all tomorrow
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: I can understand that.
<Dken2021> having a juvie in equestria is like having a jail in Tazmily village, there would be no use
<Bunny_Striker> so... who`s streaming?
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek.
<Cades> oh
<Bunny_Striker> k
<Lil_B> Dken2021 I love you for the reference
<LadyCanary> :3
<FrostedPony> how do people get to stream?
<FrostedPony> i play L4D 2 a lot :)
<Alchemist> how come that the CMC's quarrel woke discord instead of the Windigos?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why do i feel like the ticket master episode was a friend ship test?
<AJIsAwesome> FrostedPony: With the right equipment.
<LadyCanary> Because they're moderators, FrostedPony
<Purple_Edge> i played l4d2 alot too
<Purple_Edge> have about 300 hrs in it
<FrostedPony> its the only semi modern game i play
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[School]: it was celestias fault mostly, there wouldve been enough chaos on day to break it anyway
<StinkomanFan> So, where do you think the CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS will be fifteen years from now?
<Amu-chan> I'm actually rather aware of the Metroid series because my younger brother is into it.
<NENUDJUS> hello everypony!
<Bunny_Striker> StinkomanFan: somewhere
<StinkomanFan> I imagine the same prison cell Ed, Edd, n Eddy'd be in.
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[School]: they had entire classes of kids going nearby after all
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Maybe because they were thinking for themselves instead of each other?
<thelonepony> hi NENUDJUS :3
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, NENUDJUS. :)
<Purple_Edge> applebloom will be a carpenter
<twilight_sprinkle> hai NENUDJUS
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I still dont get why you have the prison of the god of chaos on display and not locked away somewhere
<Purple_Edge> sweetie belle will have a tour with saphire shores
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Humility?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also Discords personality caused his downfall
<Bunny_Striker> SpadeMagnes[School]: prisons cant be decrative?
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[School]: mlp isnt really brilliantly writter plot-wise
<Blako> I'm going to go sleeping, so bye
<SpadeMagnes[School]> If he just kept the elements he would have won
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Maybe teach him a moral lesson because of his chaotic decisions?
<Kimori> night
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Instead, he played a game
<Purple_Edge> scootallo will (incapable of flight) have the dream to be "the fastest running pony"
<Amu-chan> Later Blako!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And that caused him to lose
<FrostedPony> I could do a full play through of every Sonic The Hedgehog game for Sega Genesis.
<Dken2021> yay internet lag :\
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: That's because he likes to play games. It's fun to him.
<Purple_Edge> sonics cool
<StinkomanFan> GOTTA SPEED KEED
<Cades> brb
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: He wanted a challenge, probably.
<Kimori> k
<FrostedPony> yeah gotta go fast!
<FrostedPony> gotta go real fast!
<StinkomanFan> CHILI DOGS CHILI DOGS CHILI DOGS
<FrostedPony> thats no good!
<Dken2021> Gotta Buzz Cuzz
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[School]: well hes just chaotic, he probably enjoys more of a chaotic plan more than a calculated one
<SpadeMagnes[School]> If discorded ponies are their opposite personality, why was Big Mac a dog?
<FrostedPony> way past cool!
<AJIsAwesome> Think about it, if you just took over the world without any opposition, that would be boring right?
<Purple_Edge> Bring the chat back to life: Check
<Amu-chan> So, how are you doing Kimori?
<LadyCanary> My theory is that he switched bodies with Winona, SpadeMagnes[School]
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[School] maybe it's different effects for other ponies
<StinkomanFan> SpadeMagnes[School] because he's secretly the Smartest pony in Equestria?
<EEVERSTI> WAZZAAAAA
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I did find Granny dancing amusing
<Dken2021> yo EEVERSTI
<Purple_Edge> dragonesque...
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, EEVERSTI. :)
<Kimori> Ive been catching up on my sleep lately so I'm feeling better :)
<Amu-chan> Nice!
<EEVERSTI> movie night in 2h eh?
<Alchemist> so a discorded angel would be a nice guy and the douchebag he is normally?
<NENUDJUS> EEVERSTI: hello
<Alchemist> *not
<Dken2021> EEVERSTI at least, yea
<pony_4389> what game is they playin
<Applejack2012> good evening
<Purple_Edge> hey angel is no douchebag.... hes just a little spoiled
<AJIsAwesome> Planetside 2.
<AJIsAwesome> Purple_Edge: Exactly.
<Purple_Edge> ooohhh.... i made many enemys with that statement
<EEVERSTI> sup Applejack2012
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have to ask, whats the point of having the elements under lock and key if the bad guys can fucking always access them
<Purple_Edge> they cant
<StinkomanFan> ANGEL NEEDS TO BURN IN A FRIENDSHIP FIRE
<Applejack2012> I'm fine
<Purple_Edge> keep in mind
<twilight_sprinkle> angel is a douche, hes not spoiled. he cares for fluttershy though
<Purple_Edge> discord is a GOD
<Purple_Edge> not every enemy is a god...
<Applejack2012> Fire of our friendship
<AJIsAwesome> Because hes spoiled, he's used to getting what he wants. When he didn't, he got angry and hit Fluttershy.
<FrostedPony> discord and Spike make a cute couple.
<twilight_sprinkle> angel is like a hardcore mean guardian of fluttershy
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Like I said, Discord can teleport anywhere he wants.
<Purple_Edge> FrostedPony: ... *getting sunglasses off* what have you done?
<FrostedPony> :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I think angel is mean because he tries to get Fluttershy to toughen up
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Just my theroy
<EEVERSTI> i'm so happy now. exam week ended 2 days ago
<twilight_sprinkle> hm, yeah, he was spoiled in that ep. so i guess hes spoiled too
<AJIsAwesome> Since Discord broke free, he btoke in and stole the elements.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *theory
<AJIsAwesome> *broke
<twilight_sprinkle> *star
<Applejack2012> then hundreds of Discord wedding fics
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And apperently Changling were able to fill the entire room in the finale...
<FrostedPony> i bought a new laptop a few days ago. Out of the box it had 81 background processes running. After uninstalling all the bloatware and disabling some stuff in msconfig i have 38 background processes running.
<jojoyasmin> So guys, what are we watching/talking about?
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Well, it is a big hall.
<Applejack2012> and lots Pinkie Pie Discord arts
<Gunthler> SB o_o
<Gunthler> :3
<AJIsAwesome> jojoyasmin: Lore in MLP.
<Purple_Edge> THATS IT
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So what, they just all whent int there and waited?
<Purple_Edge> pinkie pie <3 discord
<LadyCanary> o_o
<LadyCanary> Hell no.
<jojoyasmin> ._.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I just got into a Batman conversation with a cutie! All is god in the world~
<twilight_sprinkle> lol the pinkie x discord pic
<StinkomanFan> I saw this picture of Discrod feeding a fat Pinkie Pie with Chocolate rain.
<LadyCanary> :D :D :D DOHOHOHOH Scoots~
<twilight_sprinkle> all is god?
<twilight_sprinkle> everything is god?
<FrostedPony> that would mean i am god
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I'm still not gonna be satisfied untill Celestia gives a apology to Twilight for doubting her
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Yes, allis god >_>
<Purple_Edge> wait wait wait wait
<twilight_sprinkle> my toilet is god, i knew it!
<Purple_Edge> celestia and luna are princesses
<EEVERSTI> http://gyazo.com/a0422cd3a9b5e30e64eee3a60d68493c I'm designing some monster for my mlp comic. What do you guys think? :)
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Maybe she will in later seasons.
<Purple_Edge> they are no "gods"
<Purple_Edge> so when discord is the GOD of chaos
<Purple_Edge> shouldnt there be a GOD of order?
<FrostedPony> You know what would be awesome? Having a urinal in your bedroom.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03anyway, afternoon', y'all~
<ASoftFluffyThing> Scoot-Scootaloo, attracting all the ladies
<AJIsAwesome> EEVERSTI: It's nice. :)
<FrostedPony> That would be so convienent.
<LadyCanary> Scoots, you so silly :3 what specifically did you talk about Batman-wise with her?
<AJIsAwesome> FrostedPony: But then you'l have the faint smell of pee. :S
<Purple_Edge> FrostedPony: >implying the urinal wouldnt stink the shit outta your room
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<FrostedPony> just clean it every once in awhile
<FrostedPony> :)
<Alchemist> FrostedPony: Thinking about the stench...no, it wouldn't :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The mane 6 tend to be victorlic friends
<FrostedPony> i could tag it on www.urinal.net
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *victrolic
<Purple_Edge> would you want to sleep besides your toilet?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hai Dken2021
<Dken2021_> yay shakey network
<Alchemist> Purple_Edge: What if... bear with me for a sec here... what if the toilet..is your bed?????
<Purple_Edge> well as long as youre no hobo that seems rather unhygienic, unhealthy and uncomfortable^^
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Well, they aren't exactly perfect. :S
<Applejack2012> hi
<Doodles> WOOT I LIKE EASTER EGGS
<Doodles> who else!!!!!!!!!!!
<Dken2021_> hai ASoftFluffyThing
<AJIsAwesome> If they were perfect friends, they would be boring and dull. :S
<Applejack2012> I love trains!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I know but they sometime dont really act like friends would
<FrostedPony> when i was 10 years old i tried sleeping in the bathtub with a blanket.
<Doodles> FAIR ENOUGH
<Train> choo choo
<Purple_Edge> Alchemist: Well then... i think that *puts sunglasses on* you will have some wet dreamsn
<FrostedPony> it was comfortabl for awhile.
<Purple_Edge> YEEEEEEEAAAAAHHHHHH
<Alchemist> :D
<StinkomanFan> Your bed's right next to your toilet! And you get free knives all the time! PRISON IS FUCKING AWESOME!
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: So they shouldn't give into their inner flaws, just like humans would? :S
<Invi> StinkomanFan, free knives?
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> Hello everyone, how are we doing
<Train> Shanked
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Darkts3|Protoss|MLG. :)
<Dken2021> hai Darkts3|Protoss|MLG
<thelonepony> hi Darkts3|Protoss|MLG :)
<Invi> hi Darkts3|Protoss|MLG ^^
<Applejack2012> hi
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> and what are we watching today :)
<FrostedPony> You have to make your shanks in prision, they're not free.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi Darkts3|Protoss|MLG
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Darkts3|Protoss|MLG
<FrostedPony> gotta sharpen your sporks.
<thelonepony> hi Invi :)
<KickMe> sometimes i wonder why i get kicked from channels but hey.. Hiya everypony
<Invi> hai thelonepony ^^
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> KickMe: its a mystery
<twilight_sprinkle> hi KickMe
<Dken2021> hey KickMe
<thelonepony> hi KickMe
<Purple_Edge> you just got trolled
<Alchemist> I have never ever used or even seen a spork irl.
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> So what are we watching?
<Purple_Edge> you just said that you wanted to get kicked
<FrostedPony> they have sporks at taco bell.
<KickMe> SPORKS ARE THE FUTURE
<Dken2021> FrostedPony gasp!
<thelonepony> Wrek playing Planetside II
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> damn, thats Wrek?
<StinkomanFan> Tonight we're watching GHOST BUSTERS
<Dken2021> mmhmm
<Applejack2012> hi
<LadyCanary> Yes :3
<LadyCanary> Aint he cute? o///o
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> i imagined him to be a little gothy, xD
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: The fact that they do this makes them more relatable to human beings, which is why we can relate to them very well. There is no such thing as a perfect friend. Everyone has flaws.
<Purple_Edge> Sporks are the most exotic inventions of all of ponykind
<LadyCanary> ....Why Darkts3|Protoss|MLG XD
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Twilight seems to be the only one who knows when things are suspecious..
<Dken2021> thus he was kicked
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> LadyCanary: mebe the way he acts xD
<Purple_Edge> wait do they even have sporks in ponyville?
<Purple_Edge> or do the eat everything with they magnethooves?
<LadyCanary> He...doesnt act goth o_o
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You would think the Princess of love acting bitchy....would raise questions...
<LadyCanary> Wut.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Playing Sporks....
<Alchemist> Purple_Edge: have you seen anypony eat with silverware?
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> hi Scoot-Scootaloo :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Sporks are fuckin' awesome
<Dken2021> allo scoots
<thelonepony> hi Scoot-Scootaloo
<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: silver spoons cutie mark?
<Purple_Edge> i saw them eat with their hooves that somehow have a process in their mids that produces gravity
<Purple`Prose> Has anypony heard the theme for Skyfall?
<Applejack2012> good evening
<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: nvm
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> oh lol
<Alchemist> twilight_sprinkle: but have you seen actually anypony use it?
<Purple_Edge> they obviously can controll the gravitational force to let it stream out on one side of their hoove
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The fuck kind of cutie mark is a spoon?
<Purple_Edge> to a straight line
<StinkomanFan> I like to think That Celestia kidnaps anypony who makes a new invention and takes all the credit for it.
<rdibp> NOVEMBER!!
<Purple_Edge> they obviously dont need silverware
<rdibp> also hi
<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: (chats moving fast so i misread), but im not sure, i thiiiink i mightve
<Dken2021> hai rdibp
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi rdash
<thelonepony> Hi rdibp
<Purple_Edge> and yes they have
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi rdibp
<AJIsAwesome> Hi rdibp :)
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi rdibp
<Applejack2012> hi
<Purple_Edge> cutiemarc chronicles....
<Purple_Edge> AJ
<Purple_Edge> Manehatten
<Purple_Edge> "should i take the salad gable" n stuff
<rdibp> hold on my internet is all crudy
<Purple_Edge> fork*
<twilight_sprinkle> oh crap, i forgot i havent even voted
<Alchemist> but she didnt use it
<StinkomanFan> Silver Spoon's talent is Ettiquiet. It's actually a Soup Spoon she has
<LadyCanary> I read that as cuddly instead of cruddy XD
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The apple family founded Ponyville right?
<AJIsAwesome> Yes.
<thelonepony> eeyup
<Purple_Edge> but it would be pointless to put that stuff on the table without the intent to use or to decorate anything.... its not one of pinkies partys...
<ASoftFluffyThing> 3 fruit roll-ups left
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So how are they fucking broke?
<Dken2021> thus the drawfriend has an awesome header! http://derpy.me/7CxW-
<LadyCanary> Sick!
<twilight_sprinkle> awwww survey is no longer available :<
<rdibp> hello again ^^
<StinkomanFan> ALSO! I took a field trip to an Apple Farm today
<rdibp> :O
<Purple_Edge> they are broke because filthy rich is buying all the jelly and apples for absurdly low prices
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> hmmm, so basically Planetside 2 is Battlefield 3 in the future
<Purple_Edge> and reselling them more expensive
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You would think the family that made Ponyville and their main food source would be semi wealthy
<Purple_Edge> so they only got minimal incoem from that + their own sellings in the market
<Kimori> hey stormy
<Kimori> Stormy_ I mean
<rdibp> but who would want apples?
<Cades> haha hey
<StinkomanFan> It... wasn't as whimsical as it was opn the show. :(
<AJIsAwesome> Purple_Edge: Interesting theory. I like it.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But doesnt most of his profit coem from zap apples?
<Purple_Edge> the money that would belong to the apples rightly belongs to filthy...
<Alchemist> SpadeMagnes[School]: and cider
<Applejack2012> apples, apples
<Purple_Edge> the only things he does is buying cheap stuff and selling it more expensive
<Purple_Edge> he aint doin shit for his money....
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Apples and apple accessories (no joke intented).
<Alchemist> Purple_Edge: welcome to the business world :d
<Meanwhile> Come back to stream, still Planetside. Are they winning yet?
<rdibp> is there even an economy in Ponyville? i have never seen something like Wall St. there,
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So if The apple family even goes under, Filthy will too
<Derp_Derp> goodbye work week, hello weekend, and HELLO BRONYSTATE
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> man i can barely hear Wrek
<StinkomanFan> IRL people use ladders to harvest apples. Apparently because the pusses can't handle the PAIN
<rdibp> hai Derp_Derp /)
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> Hello Derp_Derp
<Applejack2012> hi
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Have you ever tried to kick a tree?
<pinkiespice> back
<rdibp> ded
<BaconMane> 0,5Hello there guys
<thelonepony> hi Derp_Derp
<StinkomanFan> Go kick an appletree as hard as you can!
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Considering how greedy filthy is, I doubt it. He'll probably mooch off anthor business in Equestria.
<thelonepony> Hi BaconMane :3
<rdibp> hai BaconMane
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, BaconMane! :)
<Purple_Edge> >implying the apples wouldnt fall out of the baskets
<Dken2021> BaconMane! oh how I missed those bacon colors of yours, how's it going?
<Purple_Edge> >implying the tree would live through such a hard shake that he looses all his apples
<Alchemist> *magic*
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I still love the fact Diamond is only rich beacuse of the Apples
<Michael> howdy everypony!!!
<Purple_Edge> >implying humans are strong enough
<rdibp> what about cider season?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Michael! :)
<Dken2021> hai Michael
<StinkomanFan> BRING ME BACK THE APPLES YOU KICKED OUT OF THE TREES,
<SpadeMagnes[School]> That shut her smug ass up
<thelonepony> Hi Michael
<Purple_Edge> >implying the buck wouldnt destroy all the leaves
<StinkomanFan> AND IF THEY AREN'T RAINBOW YOU FAILED
*Michael hugs AJIsAwesome Dken2021 thelonepony
<Derp_Derp> way to shoot me down baconmane :<
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They should make Zap apple cider
<Applejack2012> ji
*Dken2021 returns the favor for Michael :3
<Purple_Edge> SHIT JUST GOT REAL spade
<rdibp> :O I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE
<Purple_Edge> the thing is
*rdibp steals Michael's favor
<Purple_Edge> zap apples... are magical... they arent like normal apples
<rdibp> ^^
<Cypresswolf> Hello Everpony :)
<StinkomanFan> Maaaaaaagic
<Michael> :|
<Alchemist> SpadeMagnes[School]: that would be the equivalent of vodka?
<Applejack2012> hi
<thelonepony> hi Cypresswolf
<Purple_Edge> i dont think they would be able to produce the alcoholic percentage for the cider
<Bunny_Striker> wat grm irs tis?
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: filthy actually seemed liek a nice guy
<Michael> ohai Cypresswolf
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Considering that regular cider takes a lot of time to make, the apple must be right, and including the fact that Zap Apples aren't as plentiful as apples, it probably wouldn't sel well.
<Purple_Edge> since they disapear after 1 day
<rdibp> man, everyone is saying hai today
<AJIsAwesome> Hi Cypresswolf. :)
<alexxm|colt> how are things Cypresswolf
<Purple_Edge> they dont have a aging process that diverses the fruit into a stinkin pile of mold
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I doubt cider is alcoholic in the pony world
<Cypresswolf> I just figured out where to start looking for a park job - Galveston! :)
<Purple_Edge> with alcohol as a sideeffect
*Michael sends the police over rdibp
<Alchemist> Purple_Edge: just distill it a few times :)
<Applejack2012> big suddenly wall of greetings
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Nice! :)
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai :)
<Purple_Edge> you can distill zap apples? you sure?
<StinkomanFan> Berry Punch's dying liver would like to prove you wrong.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well if they managed to make several barrels of cider in several minuets Im sure it wouldent take long to do the same with zap apples
<Purple_Edge> "these arent like normal apples"
<Michael> hai MaxTheBrony
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, MaxTheBrony. :)
<rdibp> SpadeMagnes[School] isnt it when foam forms at the top, is when its alchoholic?
<Applejack2012> hi
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Michael AJIsAwesome :) Applejack2012
<Cypresswolf> Parents got that house on Tiki island, just before the bridge to the island, not far of a drive compared to what I usually drive on a daily basis
<thelonepony> hi MaxTheBrony
*rdibp breaks out of prison
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai thelonepony :)
<Invi> wb Panda|Homework ^^
<Cypresswolf> I could essentually stay there with minor expenses
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Implyig that Zap Apple cider would work the samw way as Apple cider.
<MaxTheBrony> Wb Panda|Homework :)
<Panda|Homework> ^^
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have no idea, do I look like I know how pony cider works?
<Purple_Edge> the thing is.... if they already have a process tha destinates their existence (the plop after a day) means they dont have a second one
*Michael hugs Applejack2012 forgot :3
<Applejack2012> wb
<Bunny_Striker> I`m eating spagehtti
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back, Panda|Homework! :)
<thelonepony> wb Panda|Homework :3
<Purple_Edge> means they dont need to be able to mold
<Purple_Edge> so this COULD MEAN
<Applejack2012> grouphug!
<AJIsAwesome> Bunny_Striker: LOTSA SPAGHETTI!
<ASoftFluffyThing> wb Panda|Homework
<Michael> Wb Panda|Homework
*rdibp hugz Applejack2012 :3
<Amu-chan> I don't think Androirc likes Stormy...
<Purple_Edge> a jar of zapapple-jam... could be as eternal and immortal as celestia
<rdibp> :O
<Cypresswolf> The only downside I can think of that will be a major issue are Galveston's biker weekends
<Panda|Homework> all the welcome backs :3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I still find that Zap apple joke on that comic I saw once funny
<Panda|Homework> glad to be back XD
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: I know which one you're talking about. :D
<Meanwhile> You left?
<Purple_Edge> we should get the zap apple jam to make a coup and take the power
<AJIsAwesome> I would LOVE to see RD's parents, though.
<Michael> who thinks that ":3" needs an emoticon?
<StinkomanFan> I also got to go to Walmart today and got Shiny Blindbag Pones :3
<Purple_Edge> maybe his rule will be even better than celestias
<Bunny_Striker> AJIsAwesome: me too...
<AJIsAwesome> Michael: I think it's fine as it is.
<ASoftFluffyThing> StinkomanFan, wave 4?
<mentallyeffedguy> guys
<Cades> Androirc doesn't like anybody :p
<AJIsAwesome> Yes/
<twilight_sprinkle> StinkomanFan: :O i need some too
<AJIsAwesome> *?
<mentallyeffedguy> have you seen brony gangnam style?
<thelonepony> yeah?
<StinkomanFan> It was Trixie and Twilight Sparkle :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So why does Rarity seem so radicaly different than her parents?
<AJIsAwesome> mentallyeffedguy: Yep.
<mentallyeffedguy> to awesome :D
<thelonepony> mentallyeffedguy: eeyup
<Purple_Edge> inb4 adoption
<Michael> AJIsAwesome: just for the lulz
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Is that accent natural or just something she does?
<twilight_sprinkle> StinkomanFan: i wish i were lucky enough to get trixie and twilight..
<DaringDerpy> hello
<Purple_Edge> raritys parents thought they couldnt produce a filly... so they got rarity and after a while they miraculously got one
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Because not every child looks identical or sounds identical to their biological parents?
<mentallyeffedguy> its the greatest thing ive seen in my entire life
<Michael> mentallyeffedguy: blackgryphon got all the swag in that video
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well i mean the accent
<Cypresswolf> I think most of the bikers on those weekends hang out on the northside of the island - and along the seawall - few travel south to the park
<rdibp> my money is that season 3 is going to premire on the 30th of November
<ASoftFluffyThing> I read some theory thing that Sweetie Belle was Rarity's daughter and Rarity told Sweetie to pretend that they were sisters so Rarity wouldn't have a bad name
<purple_squid> Hey guys! What we looking at here?
<Purple_Edge> you already lost your money rdibp
<mentallyeffedguy> Michael: the navy guy was awesome
<ASoftFluffyThing> Or somethin like that. I don't remember
<Barbetos|AtWork> Crazy bastard mode
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Her father sounds like he's from the pony equivalent of newyork
<rdibp> :(
<Barbetos|AtWork> Whats going on gusy!
<Bunny_Striker> Chaos... chaos everywhere in this game...
<twilight_sprinkle> ASoftFluffyThing: lol wtf
<Michael> mentallyeffedguy: that was blackgryphon
<rdibp> its Discord's doing
<Purple_Edge> hub: " the earliest airdate possible is the 3rd... the latest possible date for it to air is the 20th"
<Meanwhile> Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne, milk for the Khorne flakes.
<Applejack2012> chocolate milk
<mentallyeffedguy> Michael: well i dont know all the bronies, but he was awesome
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Chocolate milk of glass
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: :D
<rdibp> daww Jack just jumped on my lap :3
<Michael> mentallyeffedguy: IKR
<ASoftFluffyThing> twilight_sprinkle, my reaction exactly. But I forgot where I read/saw it. It was about a year ago
<twilight_sprinkle> november...but what year?/
<Barbetos|AtWork> You had the drop on a purple guy?
<Purple_Edge> "it will be revealed atleast 30 days ahead"
<Bunny_Striker> Applejack2012: I LIKE CHOCOLATE MILK!!!
<Lambdur> It's working fine for me
<Barbetos|AtWork> Thats why he killed ya.
<Barbetos|AtWork> TTA from pulsars right now is BROKEN
<Michael> rdibp: jack?
<Lambdur> I think it's her wifi
<rdibp> My dog
<StinkomanFan> NIGHTMARE NIGHT'S COMING! You guys know what TF2's gonna do?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Is it confirmed Applejack's parents are deceased?
<Michael> :o
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Nope.
<Queen_Chrysalis> heyo all
<Cades> Yeah, it probably is
<Queen_Chrysalis> :)
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Just a theory.
<Bunny_Striker> SpadeMagnes[School]: no idea
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Queen_Chrysalis. :)
<Michael> rdibp: i liek dogs
<Michael> hai Queen_Chrysalis
<SpadeMagnes[School]> We have yet to see Fluttershy's parents or Rd's
<rdibp> StinkomanFan: add a gabe newell hat?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi Queen_Chrysalis
<Amu-chan> I guess it's the wifi that doesn't like her then.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Those would be interesting episodes
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Agreed.
<thelonepony> hi Queen_Chrysalis
<Barbetos|AtWork> THis arguement comes up like EVERY time with this game
<Alchemist> are AJ's parents even mentioned in the series?
<StinkomanFan> Gaben: Level 31 Hat
<Barbetos|AtWork> The future, we know nothing about balistics.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I want to see an episode where the CMC finally get their cutie marks
<AJIsAwesome> Alchemist: Nope. Not yet, at least.
<ASoftFluffyThing> That would be awesome.
<Meanwhile> Hahaha.
<Michael> StinkomanFan: best hat is notch hat
<Cypresswolf> I have almost 2000 deviations in my Bronies art watch list O_o It's going to take a long time to go through all of those viewing 24 at a time
<SpadeMagnes[School]> That wont be for awhile
<Bunny_Striker> Barbetos|AtWork: in the future... everyone would screw logic
<Purple_Edge> first things first..... they wont get their cutie marks all at once
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: Me too, but it would eliminate the high jinks and the gags that make the CMC who they are.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sweetie's is singing obviously..
<Barbetos|AtWork> In the future there are no ponies. T_T
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome, who says they can't get into hijinks when they have their cutie marks?
<Purple_Edge> sweetie singing... applebloom handicraft.... scootalloo atheltic
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Fat chance of Applebloom's not being being apple related
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://derpy.me/rbqvo This is one of the main reason why I love CosmicUnicorn
<Bunny_Striker> Barbetos|AtWork: dont say that, ponies will live on FOREVER!!
<Meanwhile> Bunny_Striker: except not really.
<Barbetos|AtWork> nop!
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: I guess they could, but it would eliminate the purpose of the CMC.
<Barbetos|AtWork> All good things have an end
<Meanwhile> everything has an end.
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/Z9AjO.jpg mak it happen
<Meanwhile> You, everthing around you, everything beyond you.
<Barbetos|AtWork> ANd that too
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ponies are bound to exist forever like Hyroglyph exist
<Michael> *make
<Applejack2012> Al the CMC gets Cutie Marks fics trashed
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> Barbetos|AtWork: what's your job kind sir?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Some things need to end, like Jersey Shore
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome, true. But I hoep they don't get rid of the voice crack Sweetie Belle has. That's just adorable.
<Meanwhile> Eventually all is nought but dust.
<CrimsonPhoenix> new ponies episode cannot be forever though
<puffmuffins> hi
<ASoftFluffyThing> You okay, Meanwhile?
<Applejack2012> forever...
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: Oh, definitely. I love that crack in her voice. :D
<Michael> hai puffmuffins
<Barbetos|AtWork> Darkts3|Protoss|MLG: IT.
<Cypresswolf> Fable Journey is coming out in 4 days ^_^
<CrimsonPhoenix> ASoftFluffyThing, I have bad news
<alexxm|colt> how are things puffmuffins
<Applejack2012> hi
<Purple_Edge> well i just recently read a fanfic where applebloom got a "sledgehammer" cutymark... because her talent was to be a sledgehammer for a very very angry marine
<thelonepony> hi puffmuffins :3
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome, voice crack whil singing <3
<Meanwhile> ASoftFluffyThing: My life philosophy not withstanding, yes.
<ASoftFluffyThing> CrimsonPhoenix, what happened?
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: Even better. :D
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> Barbetos|AtWork: Whats your Job?
<CrimsonPhoenix> ASoftFluffyThing, Claire's voice matured a bit
<CrimsonPhoenix> I really don't know if she can do the crack now
<ASoftFluffyThing> CrimsonPhoenix, b-but...voice crack....
<Barbetos|AtWork> Darkts3|Protoss|MLG: Like computer repair, networking, etc. etc.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I feel sorry for Luna sometimes
<twilight_sprinkle> false, there is no proven end to time, so everything will not be dust
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> Barbetos|AtWork: kewl, could you tell me how to configure my graphics card settingS/
<ASoftFluffyThing> CrimsonPhoenix, well hopefully she could sneak one in if it doesn't hurt her voice
<StinkomanFan> MOON FOR THE LUNA GOD
<Meanwhile> False, you're a bellend and no one cares.
<Barbetos|AtWork> For?
<CrimsonPhoenix> She could re do the voice she had but the voice crack was unintentional
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I wonder why Celestia didnt bother educating Luna about the changes in the past century
<twilight_sprinkle> oh grats, you spelled it right this time
<Purple_Edge> *resisting the urge to throw in the word that picollo says to gohan in DBZTAS*
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile, okay just checking. You're sorta mellow today :S
<SpadeMagnes[School]> DOOOOOOOOOODGE
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> Barbetos|AtWork: for graphics, lol. mine is overclocked
<Purple_Edge> nope
<Purple_Edge> the other one
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Neeeerd
<Purple_Edge> yeah xD
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh so what kind of graphics card do you have then?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sooo yeah it would sound force in my opinion if she tries
<ASoftFluffyThing> CrimsonPhoenix, well best not force it in. We'll still love her though <3
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> Barbetos|AtWork: Nvidia Geforce 550-ti
<SpadeMagnes[School]> >Your sister has been on the moon for 1000 years, don't bother education her on the changes
<Bunny_Striker> Purple_Edge: DODGE(BLOCK)!!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The hell celestia
<Michael> lol
<Dark_Horst> how long did it take for you guys to get the beta key after applying?
<mentallyeffedguy> CrimsonPhoenix: who/what is cosmicunicorn?
<Dovah> SpadeMagnes[School]: Because she knew that luna's 14th century antics are adorable
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dovah, Luna vs the microwave
<Michael> fire all the weapons
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Progress is best Luna fic
<Barbetos|AtWork> Darkts3|Protoss|MLG: Okay. Do you have a machine you built or did you throw that into like an HP or Dell or soemthing?
<Bunny_Striker> ASoftFluffyThing: Microwave
<ASoftFluffyThing> Has Progress updated at all?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> No idea
<StinkomanFan> IDK, Luna's doing pretty well when it comes to VIDYA GAMES
<CrimsonPhoenix> mentallyeffedguy, You know that comic called Discordantly?
<mentallyeffedguy> nope
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> Barbetos|AtWork: threw it in, and apparently it was made to be already overclocked kind sir
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bunny_Striker, microwave won that one.
<CrimsonPhoenix> mentallyeffedguy, http://cosmicunicorn.deviantart.com/gallery/38875386
<Purple_Edge> i think every mosquito should have the chance of a fair trial before the mighty squashing that follows... because you never know if he did suck you or not
<Cranberry_Scotch> What's the guy's name on first base?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Last chapter I read was something about Luna being part of the space program for Equestria.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have to ask, why did Celestia have a random statue of Nightmare Moon in the middle of the everfree forest?
<Applejack2012> microwave and laser became canon in S2
<Bronysith> Cranberry_Scotch: whoi
<mentallyeffedguy> CrimsonPhoenix: ill look at em all
<Purple_Edge> I know that fanfic
<Purple_Edge> with luna and spaceproject
<Cades> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUSZv5ynuqA I'm loving this so much
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[School]: royal budget
<Applejack2012> next TV in S3?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Purple_Edge, yeah that's the one!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Darkts3|Protoss|MLG: So it might already be overclocked. The cool thing about GPU's these days is that there is usually software that you can use to OC your config further.
<Bronysith> oh for the love of shit
<mentallyeffedguy> dats some drawing skills mate
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[School]: need to spend the taxes on the something
<CrimsonPhoenix> and also a few more work from that person http://fav.me/d4u1vsb
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Maybe not Celestia, but probably the vilagers. They probably did to remember people of Nightmar Moon.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03mentallyeffedguy: MLG Drawing skills*
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> Barbetos|AtWork: NO WAY
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fav.me/d525g4r
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But why in the middle of a forest?
<Bronysith> Wrek: game crashed
<Barbetos|AtWork> General rule though is that an unstable clock will restart your computer, so you may have to tweak it to get it right
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fav.me/d58mc3b
<Barbetos|AtWork> It is going to take a lot of trail and error
<ASoftFluffyThing> trial*
<Barbetos|AtWork> And in some cases you may even be able to look up youtube videos about the card you have
<mentallyeffedguy> Scoot-Scootaloo: guess youre right, the drawrings look fuckin amazing
<Darkts3|Protoss|MLG> Barbetos|AtWork: well the problem is that i dont know where to go to in my Nvidia Control Panel
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Because it would most likely garner attention like it should?
<Meanwhile> Really bored, anyone got any ideas?
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's a lot more in the gallery if you're curious
<Purple_Edge> Meanwhile: yeah the chat is nearly dead no one writes anything
<CrimsonPhoenix> Why I do love CosmicUnicorn though
<Barbetos|AtWork> I an not that familiar with Nvidia software at the moment, but I bet it is in Basic mode, you might want to look for Advanced mode instead.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile, none that I can think of. Besides minecraft >.>
<Purple_Edge> WUT
<CrimsonPhoenix> is how he (or she) always explore in art, learning new stuff, techinics and all that
<Bunny_Striker> needs more chaos
<Purple_Edge> i hope this was a joke
<CrimsonPhoenix> That person progress
<Dark_Horst> i wouldnt mind if i had my key
<Dark_Horst> but they wont give me one
<SpadeMagnes[School]> If war were declared
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *siren goes off*
<CrimsonPhoenix> unlike some artist that think they're great
<mentallyeffedguy> after looking at all this art makes me wanna draw, but then again i know how terrible i am at it
<Michael> ^
<AJIsAwesome> mentallyeffedguy: Same here. :D
<Purple_Edge> you want that cake?
<LadyCanary> I WANT IT
<CrimsonPhoenix> mentallyeffedguy, here's a tip
<CrimsonPhoenix> draw
<Purple_Edge> you want that cake?
<CrimsonPhoenix> just draw
<mentallyeffedguy> thats a good tip
<Bunny_Striker> I hate art classes for some reason...
<twilight_sprinkle> dat laugh
<CrimsonPhoenix> do what you want and draw what you want
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Wheres that chocolate cake?
<mentallyeffedguy> ponies dammit!
<Purple_Edge> you mean this chocolate cake?
*SpadeMagnes[School] glares
<CrimsonPhoenix> look up tutorial first to have some basic
<CrimsonPhoenix> like color and stuff
<ASoftFluffyThing> I want that cake
<CrimsonPhoenix> and draw
<Bunny_Striker> SpadeMagnes[School]: ITS A LIE!!!!!
<DashWithRainbows> guis
<mentallyeffedguy> i want it
<Applejack2012> storm of chaos
<Purple_Edge> AHAHAHAHAHAHAH TAADAAAAAAA
<CrimsonPhoenix> just keep on drawing
<DashWithRainbows> You have cake addiction
<DashWithRainbows> it's a bad habit
<CrimsonPhoenix> eventually you'll get good
<DashWithRainbows> It affects families everywhere
<AJIsAwesome> DashWithRainbows: What if I like pie more? :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What would pony africa be called?
<DashWithRainbows> Well, it has fruit.
<Kimori> hey
<DashWithRainbows> So it has healthy stuff.
<Purple_Edge> *head on fried chickend spinning around while being laughed at by nicholas cage*
<DashWithRainbows> Plus...
<Kimori> ._.
<DashWithRainbows> Chicken pie is best pie.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Now turn to the left and park it
<AJIsAwesome> DashWithRainbows: Lemon Merengue? :(
<DashWithRainbows> Correction, chicken + veg + gravy pie is best.
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: yes yes it is
<Purple_Edge> i hate the word lemon
<GreasyEthan> Evening, guys
<String_Shredder> all your base are belong to mods
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, GreasyEthan.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> MAKE LIFE TAKE THE LEMONS BACK
<Purple_Edge> the word lemon always reminds me of a .... certain.... internet site...

<Barbetos|AtWork> Sumica it is disabled for now. They plan to bring it back
<Purple_Edge> i dont want your goddamn lemons WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THESE?

<Applejack2012> old lemon fics
<GreasyEthan> If life gives you lemons make orange juice

<DashWithRainbows> I think Wrek could've taken on that tank
<DashWithRainbows> with a pistol
<Michael> twilight_sprinkle: sure
<Meanwhile> Except it blew his face off.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> OLE
<Purple_Edge> imagine a tank equiped with a normal pistol.... that would look so awkward
<Bunny_Striker> Wrek looks like one of classmates
<Dovah> If god give you lemons you FIND A NEW GOD! POWERTHIRST, GODBERRY! KING OF THE JUICE!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Senor Taco

<SafariMonkey> Hi Yahooz
<cowvarkian> Nittany_Discord: how do you know
<Amu-chan> That sounds... boring.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Experience maybe.
<DeadpoolDash> power lvls are pointless
<cowvarkian> Nittany_Discord: that may be true
<Sergio_Scriptor> if you think the game is bad,you should see "My little dashie: the clopfic" :'( why did they made that
<Michael> hai Yahooz
<AJIsAwesome> Sergio_Scriptor: ........WUT :S
<cowvarkian> DeadpoolDash: that as well
<Michael> hai sonicandmario85
<Purple_Edge> cause rule 64

<Sergio_Scriptor> AJIsAwesome: it's terrible :'(
<cowvarkian> Sergio_Scriptor: >.>
<Crippler> pokemans is a reason in and of itself to make a game
<sonicandmario85> me and my dad bought new chickens their babys their in a big cage with food and water and light they were hatched from the store 2 days ago

<SafariMonkey> Oh I read Past Sins
<AJIsAwesome> cowvarkian: I mean in terms of being original and well made.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I may hate the fanfic and the praise it gets
<CrimsonPhoenix> but the author is pretty cool
<OJ> Idea for a fanfic: Jay Sherman watches My Little Pony
<Cades> It's actually quite an adrenaline rush
<CrimsonPhoenix> moral of the day?
<Applejack2012> CN nostalgia bomb
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hate the fanfic not the author
<Crippler> I wish I had two screens, that way I could play Dark Souls AND spam the chat at the same time.
<pinkiespice> i remeber when i had idea for naruto fanfiction
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: well, I dislike a majority of cartoon network shows, but the ones I like are made by the same producers, designers, etc as the old cartoons I liked...
*Michael was mad for the ending
<CrazyHippie> Hi everypony
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, CrazyHippie. :)
<Michael> hai CrazyHippie
<GreasyEthan> Why did I get kicked?
<CrazyHippie> Hi AJIsAwesome
<GreasyEthan> I did nothing
<CrazyHippie> Wassup Michael
<cowvarkian> GreasyEthan: because you displeased the gods
<AJIsAwesome> CrazyHippie: Why would you spam the chat anyways?
<cowvarkian> *mods
<Purple_Edge> lol already too late.... after uploading my story in fimfiction it got destroyed with like 1 upvote and 12 downvotes.... i took it down and got depressed <.<
<pinkiespice> where nawaki wasn't really killed, but death was faked my orchimaru to be for expermientation
<sonicdude558> There is always the popout button brlow the chat, Crippler
<CrazyHippie> AJIsAwesome: When did I spam the chat?
<GreasyEthan> I was idle for twenty minutes
<AJIsAwesome> CrazyHippie: WHOOPS. Meant for Crippler.
<cowvarkian> GreasyEthan: your point?
<AJIsAwesome> CrazyHippie: Sorry. :$
<Michael> Purple_Edge: next time there will be more luck
<Michael> Purple_Edge: never surrender
<Crippler> idk
<Purple_Edge> maybe maybe....

<CrazyHippie> AJIsAwesome: I will never forgive you! :P
<AJIsAwesome> CrazyHippie: Sorry. :(
<Applejack2012> I got over 12 downvotes on fimfiction too

<CrimsonPhoenix> wow that was short
<cowvarkian> hopefully pizza will arrive before the movies
<AJIsAwesome> CrazyHippie: Though we shouldm't overglorify ourselves.
<AJIsAwesome> *shouldn't
<CrazyHippie> AJIsAwesome: yes....sure
<Amu-chan> Really? That's quite surprising. Maybe I don't have the right being bored technique... Because when I'm bored, it's boring...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03ROB is a nice guy, veryjolly and fun to talk to all these months.

<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Sure.
<OJ> Meanwhile: Can you?
<Cades> It takes alot of skill to not be bored when you're bored. I've been practicing for years.
<Meanwhile> Dunno, usually when I share my opinion of interview guests I get told off.

<RAWRity> DeadpoolDash: Yahooz could do it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, I enjoyed ToxicMario but shortly after each time I look up his art I have that odd feeling that something is wrong with the characters

<thelonepony> hi PeachStreak
<Michael> hai PeachStreak
<Pale_Horse> Somehow playing a childrens card game has caused me to become seriously injured... :(
<OJ> My recent trip to Montreal Comic-con showed me the profound effect Ghostbusters has had on popular culture. It has fans whose dedication rival the Star Wars crowd.
<CrazyHippie> hi PeachStreak
<PeachStreak> how are y'all
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi PeachStreak :)
<Michael> PeachStreak: perfect
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol

<Jewel> In season 0 Mokuba is even more evil then Seto
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> VenHur wut ? i still own my original poken physq deck
<sonicdude558> Also what is the title of this video
<Pale_Horse> Slenderman ate Mokuba... :(
<Jewel> Just in case you were wondering
<pony_666> haha lol
<OJ> Which is all the more impressive when you consider that most of what people remember of Ghostbusters is the first movie. If the sequels and the TV show hadn't existed, the fandom would have been pretty much the same. I've never seen one movie gather a fandom like that.
<Wirisme> Yay misheard lyrics
<Amu-chan> Maybe I should try that one day...
<Vordox> LAWL
<Sergio_Scriptor> XD oh god
<thelonepony> XD
<cowvarkian> OJ: I like the second movie....
<shogipony> i really want to see seanon zero
<DeadpoolDash> if you are going to play a TCG, just play MtG
<thelonepony> those Sub titles
<Ryunosuke> Is VIGO
<cowvarkian> OJ: never seen the shows though
<sonicdude558> Yo who made dis
<spiffytech> Youtube link for that video?
<OJ> cowvarkian: me neither
<Zuxxez123> cowvarkian: I like it too, but it really is nothing like the first.
<Pale_Horse> It's like Spoony's lyrics for the Yor theme song! :D
<sonicdude558> youtube link
<sonicdude558> plox
<Ryunosuke> both cartoons kinda sucked, though the real one was better :)
<Purple_Edge> just type in "yugioh abridged movie 2"
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03NO LINKS
<Azuredragon> Just look uo CardgamesFTW
<Cades> gonna idle for a bit
<Azuredragon> up*
<VenHur> The video? It's made by LittleKuriboh, the Yugioh Abriged guy.
<cowvarkian> Scoot-Scootaloo: >.>
<Wirisme> hahaha
<CrazyHippie> wow the cards changed a lot...
<OJ> Zuxxez123: The probelm with the second is that it had a script.
<shogipony> would it be on youtube
<shogipony> ?
<Amu-chan> Ok, later!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m33s0dlGLQ1rugzy2o1_1280.jpg

<Wirisme> This again :)
<XAX> what is it called?
<OJ> Zuxxez123: Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Rick and Harold are all really strong improv comedians, and I strongly suspect that the original movie had a lot of improvised dialogue. The sequel was overwritten by being written
<Pale_Horse> Fire Hive I think
<cowvarkian> OJ: makes sense

<J_E_Smith71> RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Dan Aykroyd reportedly referred to Slimer as "The Ghost of John Belushi". In the script for Ghostbusters, Slimer is never actually called by any name, so is never given one. The creature's original moniker was simply The Onionhead Ghost, which the film crew semi-officially dubbed him because of his horrible odor, which he used to scare a couple in a scene cut from the original movie.

<Saturn> 08,01RosePetal: caaaaaaaaaaake
<Darf14> :D
<J_E_Smith71> When the cartoon series was produced, in response to the name much given to the character by audiences, the writers renamed the green ghost "Slimer", and the name stuck on all subsequent Ghostbusters properties (he was even named Slimer in the end credits of Ghostbusters II, but a character never actually referred to him as Slimer in the film canon until Ghostbusters: The Video Game), although he was referred to as "The Green Ghost" early in the r
