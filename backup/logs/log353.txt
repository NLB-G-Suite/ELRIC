*Wrek is glomped upon
<DiscordKing> You were kicked by kirz|art from #bronystate (No knives in the glomp pile). lol
<MasterBrony> (\
*Yahooz is sucked into the mass of the glomp pile
<Luna> well the thing is... interviews and trials for the various departments are still ongoing... .. so I can't give you a full list yet
<kirz|art> 1,3don't you forget it :p
<NewDCD> yeah...still on the works
<Shizuka> 13maybe just "department lead"? for the admins?
<Yahooz> ^_^/) (\<.<
<DiscordKing> glops all without knife
<Shizuka> 13something to indicate "these mods aren't just watching chat"
<MasterBrony> so whats new, Kaworu?
<Yahooz> ?
<The_4th_Wall> *yay*
<NewDCD> So a list of the Department Heads?
<Kaworu_Silverwings> a bit boored
<Tao-mell> hello, fellow bronies
<DiscordKing> knife is sad :'(
<Phase4> ohai Tao-mell
<Shizuka> 13like say you drop down Wrek's info and it says Art Department Lead, drop down Ghosties and it says Lead Admin
<Shizuka> 13stuff like that
<Phase4> everypony's talking on #BronyState
<Luna> lead mod :P
<Luna> but yea I understand
<Shizuka> 13i can put pretty much anything in there, just look how long luna and sprinkles lists are :P
<DiscordKing> ,
<Tao-mell> are they streaming anything?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01piles on Wrek
<Luna> hey I like my list...!
<Shizuka> 13being female ist a very important duty <3
<NewDCD> DCD: Lazy-ass Founder Guy Who Doesn't Really do Anything
<TopHat> not sure
<Luna> indeed it is
<Luna> we should add it your list Shizu!
<TopHat> lemme check
<Shizuka> 13and vivis
<Luna> nah but I was the first woman joining the club :)
<Tao-mell> are you just here 24/7, Tophat?
<Moop> tell me is not cute? http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NhmghHs_tIk/TbRvTpShCQI/AAAAAAAADvw/WmaDMZCQDqU/s1600/mlp_fim___a_helping_hoof_by_shadow_dancer_666-d3epj2z.jpg
<Tao-mell> everytime I show up you're always here
<TopHat> yep
<TopHat> so are other people
<Shizuka> 13but anyway, updated list of duties for everyone if they need it~
<kirz|art> 1,3nopony's streaming atm
<MasterBrony> runescape is irking me
<mario_pony> that's so adorable!
<Jim> d'aaaawww
<TopHat> but I thought we were gonna watch the super bowl
<DiscordKing> daww
<kirz|art> 1,3isn't that what it does, irk people?
<kirz|art> 1,3can't, waaaaaay too many legal issues
<Luna> anything else?
<NewDCD> being female is a very important duty
<Yahooz> dat irk
<TopHat> oh, I see
<Shizuka> 13just a couple things on the backlog
<Rainbowjack> couldent stop laughting http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr_Rpk9HR1g&list=FLVhqx62iPB434Y5xGi60vVA&index=3&feature=plpp_video
<MasterBrony> it says i havent logged out
<NewDCD> cause our viewers wouldn't like a sausagefest : P
<MasterBrony> but im still logged in
<TopHat> do you need to pay for it? I've never watched it so I don't know : /
<Moop> lol
<Yahooz> LOLZ
<Jim> HAHA
<Jim> That's funny
<Tao-mell> I'm going to a superbowl party soon
<DiscordKing> lol
<Shizuka> 13one, do we have enough records to add a "who picked this movie" detail to the list?
<Lawkjaw> what
<kirz|art> 1,3yeah, they stream it themselves, and if we were caught doing it we'd be lucky if all they did was shut down the site
<Lawkjaw> that's a paradox
<Yahooz> 100 percent lozzle cakes
<Tao-mell> with some other bronies, so it should be fun
<MasterBrony> yea
<Shizuka> 13the dA has newsletters with winners going back to early october i think, then there's the mod picks which you all know
<TopHat> so you'll be leaving? :(
<Jim> Who thinks of that?
<Yahooz> Youtube
<Rainbowjack> no idea but i had a tummy ach for some time
<MasterBrony> im logged in...but it says im logged out while im logged in
<Tao-mell> yep
<Tao-mell> I was hoping they
<Tao-mell> d have some movie or show streaming
<Diftraku> Shizuka: That might turn into "Who to blame for this movie"
<TopHat> you can't leave already
<Shizuka> 13well.. true...
<TopHat> I've been waiting for you for so long
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8mrs9mCvoM&feature=watch_response
<Yahooz> ?
<mario_pony> funny
<Yahooz> logged out of what? chat?
<Tao-mell> creeper
<Moop> RIP head phone users
<TopHat> :)
<MasterBrony> the game
<MasterBrony> you all just lost
<Tao-mell> don't make me call the cops
<MasterBrony> and so did i
<The_4th_Wall> I LOST
<TopHat> you know I'm just kidding
<Shizuka> 13but just a thought, since i really don't pay enough attention to who wins each week, i'm busy out gathering the movie details
<TopHat> or am I...
<Tao-mell> we'll never know for sure
<TheDr> sup everypony
<mario_pony> dubstep
<Rainbowjack> rip to a boring book
<Shizuka> 13second thing, i'm not 100% certain using IMDB for the details is in the legal clear, since we're caching it
<TheDr> WUB WUB WUB
<TheDr> :$
<Shizuka> 13plus after the fuffle last night over Top Secret's B status, IMDB's ratings may not be the best for us to rely on, since they're user supplied
<Diftraku> "Robots and Screen Scraping: You may not use data mining, robots, screen scraping, or similar data gathering and extraction tools on this site, except with our express written consent as noted below."
<MasterBrony> it finally let me back in
<DiscordKing> #brony
<Moop> http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTRTwItVvbIMp9l7d8uzicOGeNewcwYj6S3EB3BOAXZ9F2ptdBuG6t7jT9m
<TheDr> i found an awsome trixie wallpaper its great and powerfull
<TheDr> :|
<mario_pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R677MV--WI&feature=related this is really funny!!
<Shizuka> 13i've lost their page where they talk about ftp details you can use
<DiscordKing> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/125604
<Shizuka> 13but they include a "you can store this stuff, but only for personal noncommercial use"
<Shizuka> 13bronystate is on track to become neither
<Diftraku> We really only store: The name, the IMDB ID and the poster
<MasterBrony> IM TURNING THAT INTO A POSTER!!!
<Moop> wont load :'(
<Shizuka> 13and their plot wording, for now anyway
<Diftraku> And the movie rating
<Diftraku> Afaik
<Saturn> 08,01point of information: i love a sausagefest
<Saturn> 08,01ahem
<Diftraku> :3
<Rainbowjack> i love Alex S mixes
<sora90> i am halrious and u will quote everything i say.
<Shizuka> 13right now when a movie is added, i grab the title, year of release, mpaa rating, director, IMDB score (and number of votes), the plot summary, and poster
<Rainbowjack> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHkPJHANTFo&list=FLVhqx62iPB434Y5xGi60vVA&index=54&feature=plpp_video
<DiscordKing> 19 minets till Football
<Shizuka> 13of those, only the score, votes, and plot do i see a potential issue with, depending on where they get their plot summaries from
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm back ^_^
<TheDr> :S
<sora90> there be anyone here?
<TheDr> hello SB
<Jim> Ooh, it's my birthday in 18 minutes
<TheDr> 64
<Jim> Welcome back SB
<DiscordKing> hey SB
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Somepony told me today was the Super Bowl :D
<TheDr> :D
<Shizuka> 13i think sumica suggested using rotten tomatoes for deciding A/B based on rating (since they use critics)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm not a Football fan :P
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: you mean puppy bowl.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02American Football that is
<Jim> John Madden
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But I liek dem puppies :3
<TopHat> #bronystate
<SuperBrony64> 10,02inb4 PETA
<Shizuka> 13after a little browsing, i found that RT has an official API i could use to get most of the same information, and they don't care much how you use it
<RAWRity> also, Shilo is best Puppy
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: nah, this is all about getting the puppies adopted.
<Tarku> http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo124/AkimiTwilight/My%20Little%20Pony%20Friendship%20is%20Magic/u_mad_sorry.jpg
<TheDr> what about the G&P trixie puppy
<Shizuka> 13downside 1, rotten tomatoes doesn't list budget info, but i can't pull that from IMDB anyway
<Rainbowjack> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD5wxaiAS8U&feature=related
<RAWRity> TheDr: nah, she's overrated.
<Luna> yea.. sounds like a good combi
<Shizuka> 13downside 2, their plot summaries are really really long
<Diftraku> Oooo...
<Diftraku> I spotted a problem, potential one, in the poster resizing
<Diftraku> Is it done on demand?
<Shizuka> 13it's done when the movie is added
<TheDr> RAWRity: :'(
<Shizuka> 13it grabs the image, resizes, then stores on our server
<RAWRity> We trouble. Right here in river city. Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for Pool!
<Moop> who ever drew this is one talented pony! http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/attachments/off-topic-478/103310d1309294318-my-little-pony-friendship-magic-27919-army-artist-moe-battle-brony_army-celestia-epic-luna-nightmare_moon-war.png
<mario_pony> lol that puppy running away from a vacuum.:$
<Diftraku> I'd recommend storing the images under wp-content/images
<Shizuka> 13major upside to RT, they provide CDN links to the poster, in resized form too
<Diftraku> Instead of the pluging folder
<alexxm> what is this superbowl u speak of
<Diftraku> *plugin
<Jim> Oh wow, that is very awesome Moop
<TheDr> trixie is sad now :(
<Yahooz> -_-
<Yahooz> Wow, not alot of bronies watch football...
<mario_pony> its american football game
<TheDr> not really
<Shizuka> 13http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/docs/read/json/v10/Movie_Info this is the kind of stuff i could get from RT
*Jim doesn't care for football
<Moop> In soviet Russia That turns you into Poster
<alexxm> i at least have the excuse of being english
<mario_pony> altough i don't think they should call it football.
<Moop> i do
<Shizuka> 13obviously we wouldn't use it all, and we would still be caching the info serverside so we're not poking them every page load
<Rainbowjack> that pic remindss me of a Magic card
<Moop> i watch foot ball
<RAWRity> seriously, I could fit Shilo in one hand. She's so ADORABLE.
<Diftraku> Well, I don't see ToS on the api website
<DiscordKing> doesnt like football but needs Giants to win
<mario_pony> i mean they don't even play with their feet.
<RAWRity> DiscordKing: why?
<Shizuka> 13http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/page/read/API_Terms_of_Use
<Moop> Giants can't win
<mario_pony> they should call it handball
<Diftraku> http://www.imdbapi.com/
<RAWRity> mario_pony: I personally like the name Austrailia uses for it: Gridiron.
<Meanwhile> Hi everypony.
<DiscordKing> im a loudmouth
<Diftraku> That one
<Lawkjaw> moop
<Jim> Hi Meanwhile
<Lawkjaw> watch out with the links, bro, lol.
<TheDr> hello
<Moop> patriots neeeeeeeed to win
<mario_pony> hello!!
<Shizuka> 13IMDB's terms for pulling data are http://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?usedatasoftware
<Meanwhile> Is nothing streaming or is my page broke?
<mario_pony> PATRIOTS!!!!!
<Jim> There's nothing streaming
<Shizuka> 13and yeah the imdbapi site doesn't say anything about it, it's someone's pet project site as far as i can tell
<DiscordKing> GIANTS!!!!!!!!!!
<mario_pony> no one is streaming.
<Meanwhile> Cool. Always good to check.
<mario_pony> PATRIOTS!!!!
<RAWRity> Say what you will, I think the Broncos can still win this thing.
<Moop> LLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOYYYYYYYYYYY
<DiscordKing> GIANTS!!!!!!!!!!
<Moop> JEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNKKKKKKKKKIIIIIIINNNNNSSSS!
<TheDr> moop: lol
<Meanwhile> What on earth are you talking about?
<[XLVI]Yahooz> Now to camp in front of my TV... :3
<mario_pony> i don't care for the broncos.
<mario_pony> i lived in denver and i still didn't go for them.
<Jim> Meanwhile: Football, I don't understand either
<[XLVI]Yahooz> b-b-b-b-but... Tim Tebow... ;_____;
<TheDr> is there nothing being streamed?
<Moop> what did i do wrong?
<mario_pony> nope
<Meanwhile> Oh right, never really cared for sport.
<RAWRity> oh god, the Puppy Bowl has a Kitten Half-time show.
<Luna> we could use that?
<RAWRity> I'll die.
<DiscordKing> likes Tim Tebow
<mario_pony> all thats on for me is too cute.
<[XLVI]Yahooz> yesh :3
<Shizuka> 13imdbapi.com is what i use now, i'm just not 100% certain it's legally clear
<TheDr> 6_9
<Meanwhile> Who's winning?
<[XLVI]Yahooz> Meanwhile: it hasnt started
<[XLVI]Yahooz> XD
<mario_pony> the team with the puppies.
<Shizuka> 13plus the rating numbers IMDB gives seem to cause confusion over A/B, wheras RT uses "real" critic reviews to build the rating
<MirrorImage> super bowl?
<Meanwhile> Fine, who do we want to win?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Who's playing in the Super Bowl?
<mario_pony> PATRIOTS!!!!
<Meanwhile> Ok then, go them.
<Moop> fluttershy should be a cheerleader
<[XLVI]Yahooz> New England PAtriots vs New York Giants
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: well, everyone in my town wants the Giants to win, becuase they all still hate the Patriots for beating the Panthers years ago.
<mario_pony> sore losers much?
<Moop> patriots will win end of story
<Meanwhile> I'm going to hope for the Patriots because they have England in the title.
<TheDr> mario_pony: yaay!!
<Meanwhile> That's about as invested in this as I can be.
<Luna> do we have any other items to talk about?
<[XLVI]Yahooz> I have seen this ALL over FaceBook today: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ki-w4KYpnuw
<Shizuka> 13pretty much it for me
<Moop> i cant watch the super bowl until i catch up to the latest season in Breaking Bad
<RAWRity> well, it's the only time the Panthers have ever had a good season, so...yeah, they didn't take it well.
<Luna> okay, I think we're done then?
<Shizuka> 13if we're looking to deploy wordpress to 000web then i'll need to make sure it can write to the backlog file and has... saturn?
<DiscordKing> GIANTS!!!!!!!!!!
<Shizuka> 13php 5.4?
<DiscordKing> im a loudmouth
<Luna> unless someone else got something?
<mario_pony> i have 50 bucks on patriots they better not loose!!
<[XLVI]Yahooz> Moop: you better do that quick... Super Bowl starts in 30 mins...
<DiscordKing> GIANTS!!!!!!!!!!
<Meanwhile> They better not lose* either.
<Moop> Yahooz: o crap!
<mario_pony> PATRIOTS!!!
<Saturn> 08,015.3.2 for the stuff you need
<Shizuka> 13i think i'll rewrite the plugin to use RT for getting info, which means we won't need GD for resizing
<Tenure> ... /)º3º(\
<[XLVI]Yahooz> Im rooting for the Pats, but i feel like its going to be a repeat of '07
<[XLVI]Yahooz> in other words Giants win
<Meanwhile> What happened in 07?
<mario_pony> puppy bowls on now!!
<Saturn> 08,01000 has 5.2.something
<Saturn> 08,01i think
<RAWRity> nah, this year they don't have that whole Cheating thing to fall back on.
<Moop> Patriots fans do NOT talk about 07
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: Giants beat the Pats and kept them from getting a perfect season.
<[XLVI]Yahooz> Meanwhile: Pats went undefeated up to the Superbowl and lost to the underdog Giants
<Moop> it was perfect until....
<mario_pony> man it was just a commercial.:(
<Saturn> 08,01i have no ieda, to be honest
<Saturn> 08,01too tired to think about version numbers right now
<Luna> that's fine
<Morty> 07...it's grimdark
<RAWRity> It became a phrase to say "17 wins and ONE GIANT LOSS"
<Meanwhile> Sounds like the plot of a high school teen angst movie
<Moop> my teacher gave us no home work when they won
<Luna> shall we call it now?
<Moop> it was great
<NewDCD> Everything covered?
<[XLVI]Yahooz> 17-1... with cheating XD
<Moop> then
<DiscordKing> um what colors are the giants
<Luna> i'm gonna talk about AWS und tell my dad... some cores and plenty memory are the mane requirements
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: you mean a sports movie? Those usually have less teen angst and more cheesy as hell musical scores.
<[XLVI]Yahooz> uhhhh
<Shizuka> 13oh and someone still needs to poke an oper and get flags synced
<[XLVI]Yahooz> colors?
<Luna> true...
<Luna> that's a important one
<Morty> hello Twiroom
<Moop> i dont know
<RAWRity> ...OH GOD. THE KITTY HALF-TIME SHOW. I...I CNA'T.
<Shizuka> 13jaja
<[XLVI]Yahooz> typically white blue and a red
<Luna> a cop told me to try !sync last night
<Luna> but it did not work
<Meanwhile> I was thinking more high school RAWRity because I've never really seen a sports film.
<[XLVI]Yahooz> There arent colors, persay
<mario_pony> more like GIANT *******
<[XLVI]Yahooz> more like logos
<DiscordKing> knows nothing of football
<Luna> Dari can you talk to the opers?
<RAWRity> CUTE LITTLE KITTIES PLAYING WITH TOYS. AND FLASHING LIGHTS. THEY'RE SO ADORABLE.
<Saturn> 08,01Luna: i'd chat to you about aws now, but i'm about to go to bed
<[XLVI]Yahooz> RAWRity is the puppy bowl on now?
<Moop> epilepsy
<Luna> that's alright saturn i'm online most of the time

<Luna> but yea we also need to get owner of bsregulars and lobby if those rooms are considered BS rooms
<Meanwhile> Is that literally a bowl of puppies?
<[XLVI]Yahooz> Meanwhile: http://animal.discovery.com/tv/puppy-bowl/

<RAWRity> also, you can adopt the puppies.
<Meanwhile> Prefer kittens.

<Meanwhile> Or I did until I noticed one of the puppies is called "Sweetie Pie"
<mario_pony> oh god my eyes are bleeding from so much cuteness!!

<Moop> too bad there gonna change her name :'(
<TheDr> meanwhile: lol :D
<RAWRity> this is Meanwhile's understanding of Football: http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyxx8wJyHf1rnw5qjo1_500.jpg
<Luna> you can go to bread Saturn
*Flutterguy bows before JarlCelestia
<Luna> we'll deal with it
<Flutterguy> Mah lord.
<RawketLawnchair> No one loves her because she wasn't the pony she wanted everyone to be.
<MelaPony> Moop, change who's name?
<Saturn> 08,01anynighgght night all#
<Moop> Derp's
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: fairly accurate.
<MelaPony> Moop, what the fuck?
<DiscordKing> but i love derpy
<Luna> sweet dreams
<Luna> thanks for your time
<MelaPony> Moop, why the hell would they change derpy's name?
<Luna> communication ist key!
<mario_pony> bubbles
<RAWRity> everypony loves derpy.
<Shizuka> 13^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<NewDCD> I just imagined sleeping on a giant loaf of bread baked by Shizu....do want
<fillyfillyy> Derpy :D
<Meanwhile> Some trolls complained and said the name "derpy" was offensive to the mentally disabled.
<Moop> Some stuupid people found it offensive
<Shizuka> 13giant loaf of bread... hmmmm
<Arentius> because too many people got offended at the word derpy because the "general public" think its synonymous with retard
<Meanwhile> Whether the name is actually being changed is a matter of debate right now
<MelaPony> Moop, do you actually have any solid info on this?
<MelaPony> Meanwhile, and where is this debate going on?
<Meanwhile> Hasbro's PR department mostly.
<fillyfillyy> just like me :D
<TheDr> r they really changing her name? i thought it was blown over
<RAWRity> MelaPony: there's been RUMORS (NOTHING MORE) about "derpy" being a slur against the mentally impaired. Nothing but rumors have surfaced so far, and right now repeating any of this stuff is just hearsay.
<SlurryMoon> 3dat Silly filly
<Meanwhile> Do you not read Equestria Daily?
<Moop> there is a poll to vote on Change.org to keep her name the same
<Arentius> MelaPony there are several petitions going around for it, though I think its located in the states because the episode is still up iun europe
<kyle113> Hello :D
<NewDCD> bread mattress is best mattress
<MirrorImage> all this debate about whether Derpy's name is being changed is all theory right now, though the evidence saying it will happen is convincing
<MelaPony> Meanwhile, no i don't, link to anythink specifically related?
<Kimori> hey
<Moop> with 11,000 votes to keep it the same
<MirrorImage> that being said, i believe someone said not to have this debate here
<Kimori> everyone pretty much left
<kyle113> I see
<MelaPony> Arentius, petitions going around for it to be changed?
<Shizuka> 13ohai sb~
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hello everypony ^_^
<Jim> Sad song is sad
<Moop> soooooo cute
*mario_pony cries
<Meanwhile> MelaPony: you DON'T check Equestria Daily? Eesh. Let me find something related to the topic.
<Wheatley> I don't care what happens to her.
<NewDCD> if you get the munchies while laying down, you can just take a bite out of it~
<RawketLawnchair> More so it was some insane pony fan known as Yamino who was vocal about Derpy.
<mario_pony> is that fluttershy
<Wheatley> She's fandom.
<Moop> pinkies brew!
<Arentius> both ways, but if waht MirrorImage said is right Imma stop discussing it, as I don't awnna get in trouble
<RawketLawnchair> Also, this. http://i44.tinypic.com/w6qbds.png
<DiscordKing> remembers why he hates the superbowl
<Wheatley> She'll always be derpy to me.
<MirrorImage> and what the eff is that bottom left video?
<TheDr> i also herd they r going to pull the last round up is that true?
<ekips> what is that fluttershy vid ~.~
<Ghosties> 04SB, I do not mean to poke you but if we could make haste?
<Arentius> bottom left : my little amneisa
<TheDr> cause i liked that ep
<Arentius> amnesia*
<fillyfillyy> do the one with derpy in the car
<mario_pony> does it have to be ponies?
<Moop> yes its so funny
<MirrorImage> nah, we need some Pinkie's Brew up in here
<alexxm> do elevator suplex
<Jim> I agree with MirrorImage
<kyle113> So whats new
<RawketLawnchair> I like Sweetie Bots song more.
<RawketLawnchair> It's very cute.
<Moop> game over?
<RawketLawnchair> Something something giant hat.
<fillyfillyy> nooooooooooo
<MelaPony> it would be utterly PATHETIC if derpy's name gets changed because some fucking retards think that someone with a mental disability would be offended by her name
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Make haste with what?
<Moop> :(
<Kimori> not much really :/
<MirrorImage> or Italian theme
<mario_pony> :'(
<Lasharus> Oh good grief.
<ekips> i heard that music so often
<MirrorImage> Italian theme is good too
<Lasharus> Allow me to quote Discord:
<Moop> lololol
<Lasharus> "This again?"
<Moop> WTF?
<fillyfillyy> italian?
<Ghosties> 04With your points, sir
<MirrorImage> Italian.
<mario_pony> that sounds like spanish
<TheDr> :[ DONT YOU HATERS HURT DERPY :[
<Luna> your questions :)
<Jim> This song is totaly different
<Lasharus> There should be a new rule by the mods: "Stop discussing the bloody nameswap thing!"
<Moop> why is it soo differnt?
<Luna> and or suggestions
<fillyfillyy> this isnt even the opening though
<MirrorImage> mario_pony - they all sound alike to the untrained ear
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I don't have any points, I just wanted to give my opinions with whatever is going to be discussed.
<ekips> why does this sound like japanese to me?
<Queen_Rarity> Japin is the worlds Island
<MahBoi777> boppity boopy?
*ekips is watching too much anime
<Rainbowjack> who ever is streaming put on the Flim and Flam song PLZ

<Meanwhile> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/last-roundup-featured-on-my-little-pony.html is the most recent update as far as Derpy's name is concerned.
<Lasharus> ARGH!
<mario_pony> i speak spanish and that was all the beggining sounded like
<TopHat> Remember that song I was going to tab
<Morty> yes
<Wheatley> This isn't Japanese.
<Luna> Shizu?
<TopHat> and I promised youtube I'd have it done a week ago
<Meanwhile> But really who in this fandom doesn't look at Equestria Daily? That's just insane.
<TopHat> it's not done
<Wheatley> I understand Japanese, slightly.
<TopHat> lawl
<Luna> can you give a run-through
<RawketLawnchair> Don't worry about it. Derpy loves us. http://i44.tinypic.com/4iy5jn.jpg

<Tenure> and next is the superbowl pre post show and the post post analysis of hte preshow and then the pre game post analysis
<Meanwhile> alexxm: I saw the Night of Pony vid on an escapist thread and was motivated to locate the show from it. I did. And then I found Equestria Daily from youtube comments. story end.
<Jim> Too..much..Cute...d'aaaww
<PinkiePie101> You think that's cute?
<PinkiePie101> Well
<PinkiePie101> *shows loop of fluttershy squee*
*MahBoi777 has the goofiest grin on his face
<PinkiePie101> HOW CUTE IS THIS?
<Shizuka> 13yeah the backlog has an interface to add a movie from wordpress admin
<Ouroboros> Personally by the fan created content, namely the Skyrim and Mass Effect videos.
<ToasterLicker> OH GAWSH
<ekips> AND it is coming closer :O
<fillyfillyy> again like ive said big big girl / big big world big big cancels out... she is a girl in a world OMG
<Flaria> PinkiePie101: Fluttershy is the squee champ.flv?
<ToasterLicker> stream unlagged fluttershy :3
<PinkiePie101> eeyup
<Meanwhile> I'm Commander Sheperd and this is my favourite store in Canterlot.
<Dken2021> so, yea, rocky....
*Ouroboros grins to Meanwhile
<Shizuka> 13editing a movie maybe not, i'm going to have to work on that
<Jim> I just realised it zooms
<MahBoi777> eet is good day to be giant baby man!
<PinkiePie101> Giant baby man?
<Jim> Entire team is babies!
<ben1994> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FCq77mNhzY im coming to the moon!!!
<PinkiePie101> IMPOSSIBRU!
<Ouroboros> Pony Effect 2 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqpyAlvyP3Y
<Moop> *scary face pops up*
<MahBoi777> :D
<Kimori> ill still be a little idle, putting up a couple more things..
<SuperBrony64> 10,02What about the possibility of having a stream that could constantly show pony episodes or even setup a computer to constantly play a YouTube playlist during the off hours? I know with LiveStream previously, we kept shows we streamed recorded on the autopilot but due to the risk of getting locked down, we no longer do that. I know it's not necessarily about programming it in, but the idea
<SuperBrony64> 10,2of having it where when someone is finished streaming, Mods could easily switch to it so viewers have something to watch during the off hours.
<Meanwhile> Scary, but fun.
<MahBoi777> Moop: I expected the same thing to happen
<MahBoi777> Meanwhile: LOL
<Shizuka> 13i think that would be after we launch the first part, but if we had an embed with an infinite playlist we could work that in
<PinkiePie101> *Something is coming out of the beach ball*
<PinkiePie101> *Niblet was in the beach ball*
<PinkiePie101> "SECRET BUTT FUN!"
<Ouroboros> The Elder Scrolls VI: Equestria http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egrlzkKa6O8
<Meanwhile> That beach ball is a spy.
<MirrorImage> and the game begins!
<Moop> :d
<PinkiePie101> The CMC: I NEED AN ADULT!
<MahBoi777> The fun has been doubled!
<PinkiePie101> No
<PinkiePie101> the fun has been tripled
<alexxm> elevator thief suplex http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4xpOsCcWIw
<Moop> lol commonts
<Queen_Rarity> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQdZrUByUpQ
<Ouroboros> While I like the show a lot, its actually the fan created/remixed stuff that interests me.
<PinkiePie101> BECAUSE THERE ARE 3 CMCERS
<PinkiePie101> :3
<Meanwhile> They have footage.
<MahBoi777> OHHH
<MahBoi777> i see i see
<ToasterLicker> WUT
<PinkiePie101> HUZZAH! THE FUN HAS BEEN TRIPLED!
<Jim> Dad, are you space?
<Shizuka> 13another idea on the table is an IRC bot, maybe daribot maybe not, where we would say "hey so and so is streaming" and it would update channel topics, go post a tweet, and update things on the site
<Meanwhile> Yes, now we are a family again.
<PinkiePie101> Actually, he's spy.
<MahBoi777> yes son, now we are a family again
<PinkiePie101> c:
<Jim> Spaaaaaaace
<fillyfillyy> spaaaaac
<fillyfillyy> e
<ToasterLicker> LSD is one helluva drug :3
<PinkiePie101> SPAAACCEEE
<SuperBrony64> 10,02That would also be good to have as well.
<Meanwhile> The Yellow Submarine is a helluva drug.
<Moop> ^_^
<unfoundbug> spaaace?
<MahBoi777> space dad is best dad
<Moop> YOSHI"S FUCK ISLAND!
<kyle113> Okay
<ekips> i want space as my dad
<Meanwhile> ...-
<Moop> FUCKING*
<PinkiePie101> Secret butt fun island anyone? Eh?
<MahBoi777> such nostalgia!
<Meanwhile> "Yoshi's fuck island" Cannot unsee.
<Question> Play Filly Sauce :)
<Moop> love tis game
<Jim> Yoshi never did that the last time I checked
<TOY_PON32> If I ever win the super bowl I'm gonna say on live television, "We're going to Ponyville!"
<prince-dari> Yeah, I can probably set it up.
<MahBoi777> LOL
<MahBoi777> genius TOY
*Jim hands TOY_PON32 all my money
<alexxm> can i come with
<Athena> Hello~
<TOY_PON32> Everypony can come :3
<Jim> ohai Athena
<Meanwhile> Hello Athena
<ben1994> _._
<PinkiePie101> Hello TOY_PON32
<DiscordKing> yay
<PinkiePie101> :3
<ToasterLicker> YESH
<alexxm> hi Athena
<TOY_PON32> Hey Athena
<ekips> okay, I heard "super bowl" so many times in the last 3 weeks, now i am googling it
<SuperBrony64> 10,02What about alternative uses for the Mane6 rooms? Seems like they are inactive for the most part outside of live episode streams.
<Moop> BEEER
<Rainbowjack> HAHA BEER
<MahBoi777> I would say "I'm goin to Kiddie Land!"
<PinkiePie101> BEEEEEEEEEEEER
<Queen_Rarity> I can't remember
<MirrorImage> ekips - you don't know what the Super Bowl is?
<Jim> ekips: It's nothing to get excited about
<TOY_PON32> No Ponyville is better
<PinkiePie101> I'm not that excited about the super bowl
<MahBoi777> true
<Rainbowjack> beer
<Shizuka> 13we've decided to lock the mane6 rooms during the week, have everyone go to mane chat
<prince-dari> They're going to be locked outside pony ep stream.
<PinkiePie101> I'm more excited about MLP FiM
<Athena> The super bowl? Not intrested.
<ekips> MirrorImage: nope
<Ghosties> 04^Those
<MirrorImage> where do you live/
<Rainbowjack> beer
<Moop> *dancing*
<Shizuka> 13during pony episodes they open up and mane is muted to cut down on the super flood
<alexxm> england
<SuperBrony64> 10,02That's a good idea.
<MahBoi777> I hail from the land of Valhalla
<ekips> Germany
<Moop> Hell
<RAWRity> You know, I'm sure they're happy about winning the Coin Toss, but all I can think of is that i just won a free Papa Johns pizza with this.
<Queen_Rarity> NORGE
<MirrorImage> k, you know what American Football is?
<PinkiePie101> "Germany"
<TOY_PON32> buck Disneyland we got ponyville
<PinkiePie101> More like gerMANEy
<PinkiePie101> Get it?
<PinkiePie101> :3
<Athena> do ho ho
<Jim> Queen_Rarity: Norwegian broohoof /)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02As I know new viewers usually get confused why there is no chat not knowing we have a main #bronystate room.
<MahBoi777> Fillydelphia
<PinkiePie101> Let's go to ponyville instead of disney land.
<The_4th_Wall> Marco...
<Queen_Rarity> (\
<Shizuka> 13^ so much
<ekips> PinkiePie101 +1 moon cookie for you
<TOY_PON32> I would like a filly
<PinkiePie101> :D
<alexxm> doesn't the german parliment have pony time
<PinkiePie101> COOKIE TIME
<MahBoi777> LOL
<PinkiePie101> *NOM*
<MirrorImage> alexxm - no, that's the Swedish Pirate Party
<PinkiePie101> c:
<MirrorImage> and that's just for their own personal meetings
<Meanwhile> Does anyone know a decent adblocker for chrome that isn't adblock?
<alexxm> oh
<ben1994> its stil going? :/
<TOY_PON32> PinkiePie101: You Win!
<Queen_Rarity> (>'_')># Waffles ppl
<Jim> Guise, we need ponyland. It's like Disneyland, but PONIES.
<Meanwhile> I'd go there.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02If you're going to lock down the rooms, are you going to force the current IRC embeds to just connect to the main BronyState channel instead of the other pony rooms?
<MahBoi777> Meanwhile: I wish, I have the same problem
<Athena> So who's streamin?~
<Moop> http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/218/627/12944.jpg
<Meanwhile> SB is I think.
<PinkiePie101> Who's streaming
<ToasterLicker> oloP
<PinkiePie101> Oh wow
<MahBoi777> Jim: genuis man!
<MasterBrony> polo?
<Queen_Rarity> No Ponyland plz, it would be as bad as Disneyland
<TOY_PON32> Pony Hut Jr.
<MahBoi777> ^
<Shizuka> 13that would be a good idea, although in theory what will happen is they'll join #bronystate and be redirected there when they try to join a mane6 channel
<PinkiePie101> Sounds like dubstep :o
<MasterBrony> valdez?
<Meanwhile> I think you want THAT hospital. Pony hut general.
<MahBoi777> Super Pony Hut Jr.
<MasterBrony> poker?
<The_4th_Wall> oh, good. youre alive
<Moop> this is nothing like dubstep
<TOY_PON32> :3
<PinkiePie101> wait
<MahBoi777> :D
<PinkiePie101> THIS ISN'T DUBSTEP
<PinkiePie101> ._.
<MasterBrony> chinese food
<Meanwhile> Yeah, this is good for a start.
<ben1994> im enjoying this streaming lots :D
<Meanwhile> Dohoho
<PinkiePie101> This sounds like techno or something...
<ToasterLicker> not dubstep but still good
<PinkiePie101> yup
<MahBoi777> huzzah!
<MasterBrony> the narwhal bacons at midnight
<ekips> does the genre matter? when its good i couldnt care less about the genre
<Rainbowjack> The fun has been doubbeld
<PinkiePie101> THE FUN HAS BEEN TRIPLED
<Queen_Rarity> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=birwVeah76I
<Shizuka> 13so to viewers not much will change, they'll just be dropped into a channel that actually has activity
<MahBoi777> :D
<Moop> its country guys come on
<The_4th_Wall> NARWAHLS
<Meanwhile> One does not simply double the fun.
<kyle113> o.o I just noticed you are indeed a guy
<MahBoi777> lol
<TOY_PON32> MaiBoi777 is a very tough Brony. He watches MLP....Gen 3
<ekips> one does not simply use an overused meme
<The_4th_Wall> Inventors of the Shish kebab
*Rainbowjack wants some CUPCAKES!!!
<Kimori> huh?
<Meanwhile> One does not simply take an arrow the knee.
<ToasterLicker> Thats liek saying voldermorts name dont mention gen 3
<Meanwhile> What now~
<PinkiePie101> No, I do not want them
<MirrorImage> i suppose i should ask this now, does anyone want me to keep the chat updated on Super Bowl scores or do we just don't care because ponies?
<MasterBrony> theyll stop cthulu eating ye
<PinkiePie101> Listen to the music that is streaming
<DiscordKing> i do
<MahBoi777> that's nothing, TOY_PON32 read MLD.....without shedding a single tear
<PinkiePie101> That's what we do right now
<alexxm> i don't care because english
<ToasterLicker> Sure why not
<Meanwhile> I don't care because I don't care about sport.
<Jim> I don't mind superbowl, but I'm not really interessed in it.
<ToasterLicker> MLD? that was supposed to be sad?
<Rainbowjack> its the song that plays when Fluttershy models
<Athena> What do you think of this: http://i479.photobucket.com/albums/rr157/pocapila/SacredAthena.jpg
<Dken2021> so there's a twilight ad
<PinkiePie101> MLD is supposed to be sad...?
<TOY_PON32> I cried like a bitch reading MLD
*ekips still has to read mld
<PinkiePie101> Since when?
<Meanwhile> I think it's very gold Athena
<MahBoi777> LOL, same here
<PinkiePie101> I didn't cry.
<Queen_Rarity> EPICNESS http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve-yz2z7cNQ
<Athena> mhm.
<MahBoi777> you are a champion my friend
<Jim> PinkiePie101's heart is made from steel
<Shizuka> 13and for us the zillion viewers during pony episodes will be spread out and easier to manage than one giant flood
<PinkiePie101> yup
<alexxm> is this supposed to be animated
<TOY_PON32> No it's ice
<MahBoi777> we're dealing with a badass here!
*MahBoi777 steps back
<PinkiePie101> *listens to whats streaming*
<PinkiePie101> what is this i dont even
<Dken2021> who is streaming now atm?
<TOY_PON32> yeah cool story bro
<SuperBrony64> 10,02That's good, IMO, the main chat can be troubling to manage alone along with the other pony rooms active.
<ToasterLicker> skyrim+stream=better than superbowl
<kyle113> You sent me a request on Windows Live right?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Can we make it automated instead of users picking out a pony room?
<Kimori> yeah
<ToasterLicker> Derp
<MahBoi777> ah Lyra
<PinkiePie101> the internet in a nutshell: "skyrim skyrim skyrim skyrim"
<TOY_PON32> I want bud light bottle that's blue :(
<Rainbowjack> needs more Berry puch
<SuperBrony64> 10,02As the Rainbow Dash room gets more cluttered than, say, the Applejack room
<ToasterLicker> puch?
<MirrorImage> FIRST SCORE: Intentional Grounding penalty against New England; Giants - 2, Patriots - 0
<PinkiePie101> nah, more bon bon
<MahBoi777> that and all of those arrow to the knee jokes
<alexxm> i thought the internet had more pony
<PinkiePie101> ikr
<PinkiePie101> well
<Meanwhile> Needs more Jimmy gee Gibbons.
<PinkiePie101> more ponies than skyrim
<The_4th_Wall> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zMt_nnjpuI&context=C3456b88ADOEgsToPDskLTkhdG7bvv-NXADXV-kr3K
<MasterBrony> -y hooves
<MahBoi777> ^
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So like if we have 6 rooms and 1200 viewers, there would be 200 viewers in each room, ideally.
<PinkiePie101> I like turtles
<Meanwhile> All my horses in skyrim die ¬_¬
<Shizuka> 13yes
<PinkiePie101> ;_;
<Shizuka> 13sort of..
<MahBoi777> I like trains
<TOY_PON32> Elton John is best king, that's gay :3
<DiscordKing> noooooooo
<PinkiePie101> WAIT NO NO NO
*ekips gets hit by a train
*PinkiePie101 got run over by a train.
<alexxm> at least take the meat Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Seriously, the first time I got a horse, a bandit group appeared, killed it, and ran away.
<Rainbowjack> Berry Punch
<MahBoi777> double kill!
<Shizuka> 13we can set a limit on channels and a forward.. so say 1200 limit, the 1201st person gets sent to the next room in a line
<Meanwhile> The second time it bugged and run up a tree, then died from the fall.
*PinkiePie101 revived himself
<Dken2021> so no one's watching the ads?
<PinkiePie101> *Troll face*
<MasterBrony> NOT PONY RELATED
<ekips> Meanwhile that happened to me too, i thought they were horse thiefs
*Jim uses phoenix down on ekips
<MahBoi777> OH U
<TOY_PON32> Dken2021: I am
<MahBoi777> :D
<Meanwhile> Third time it got eaten by a bucking dragon. Not even kidding.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Why not just spread out viewers evenly across all the rooms though during the pony episodes?
<PinkiePie101> What's next.
<kyle113> Your name is Matthew
*Athena is not watching the super bowl at all
<MahBoi777> these ads.....are so fascinating
<TOY_PON32> Flavor Flav!
<PinkiePie101> IT'S THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXIE
<Meanwhile> I hate Trixie.
<Moop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=whmCk_3mpDA
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Ideally, there won't be an even amount, but...
<TOY_PON32> Meanwhile: No one cares
<PinkiePie101> "powerful" "great'
<Shizuka> 13can't do that part, or we could with like a bot monitoring user counts but there would be mode changes everywhere
<ekips> stories <3
<TOY_PON32> :3
<PinkiePie101> lolno
<Athena> I like fan fic trixie~
<Kimori> yep
<Dken2021> oh the giants are ahead
<The_4th_Wall> Have you tried performing a hard reet?
<Meanwhile> TOY_PON32: Don't care.
<MasterBrony> "reet"?
<TOY_PON32> :P
<The_4th_Wall> *reset
<Dken2021> I'm indifferent to trixie
<PinkiePie101> what the hell is with that voice
<Shizuka> 13can't like take an incoming JOIN and direct it to any channel, that i know of it's only channel A fills up, push to channel B
<ekips> nothing i am reading :(
*TOY_PON32 loves Trixie
<Moop> no YOU CANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<MahBoi777> is trixie makin a comeback this season?
<ekips> i hope so
<kyle113> I didnt know you were a guy :P just saying
<Jim> Who knows
<MasterBrony> you might want to perform a hard reset on your typing skillz LOL
<MirrorImage> OOO! Project Horizons
<PinkiePie101> trixie was the one barking in the new episode though
<Meanwhile> The thing I hate is that people seem to actually like her despite the fact she's a total knobjockey.
<Moop> Trixie is evil
<Jim> Trixie is a showoff, but definately not evil
<Kimori> oh ok
<PinkiePie101> Yeah.
<TOY_PON32> Meanwhile: I dont know what youre talking about
<Athena> I wish trixie would come back good, so then we can have an episode about second chances.
<TOY_PON32> :3
<PonyBlade> http://shortyawards.com/EquestriaDaily
<Meanwhile> You don't have to be evil to be a bellend.
<MahBoi777> she returns with an Ursa major in a cage, lawl
<PonyBlade> PONIES MUST PREVAIL!!!
<TOY_PON32> Meanwhile: Im just kidding btw :)
<ekips> im hoping for that too Athena
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Well, I mean like, when someone loads the page, it automatically switches the client to swap which room the viewer gets in. So setup a pattern in the code, it won't work ideally, but it will work better than what is being used now.
<Moop> me gusta
<Ouroboros> I dont think there are any evil characters in MLP, even the villans so far have been pretty complex.
<PinkiePie101> *Looks at the picture*
<PinkiePie101> me gusta
<Rainbowjack> EVIL SPIKE!!!
<MirrorImage> the extent of Evil in FiM so far has been selfish evil
<Moop> What about Discord he was pretty evil
*PinkiePie101 fell asleep due to the music.
<ekips> gilda was evil...but she had a rough childhood i guess
<MirrorImage> with maybe a partial exception for Discord
<Meanwhile> Discord was more chaotic than evil.
<TOY_PON32> Discord is awesome
<The_4th_Wall> This is 20% cooler
<ekips> discord just wanted to have fun
<PinkiePie101> Discord is cool
<Rainbowjack> Spike was evil to frame owl
<MahBoi777> Discord is best troll!
<PinkiePie101> Ikr?
<alexxm> chaos doesn't know good or evil Moop
<Meanwhile> Though of course, when the world is naught but chaos, then chaos is order. Go figure.
<Moop> Discord was the best villan i think
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So instead of having the IRC server do it, let the site do it. Most viewers connect using the website anyway.
<Rainbowjack> Ghost is a HAMEBOOOONNNN
<Shizuka> 13dunno, i haven't dealt with the chat embeds
<PinkiePie101> Discord is new best villian
<MahBoi777> never have I seen explosive chocolate milk, freakin genius
<Shizuka> 13saturn or dari might have a better idea of if the server could juggle them
<Athena> Confound these ponies driving me to sign up for twitter >>
<TOY_PON32> So what if Giants have 2. Thats all they will have until the end of the gams
*PinkiePie101 exploded due to chocolate milk
<PinkiePie101> There, now you've seen it
<Moop> alexxm: true
<MirrorImage> TOY_PON32 - you say that now, but they're on a hell of a drive right now
<MahBoi777> Chocolate Rain!
<Ouroboros> Discord was more like a caprecious child, wanting afirmation and doing what he imagined was having fun with his "friends"/pawns. Im not sure if he was all out evil though. More like a fairy, something alien, unprredicatable
<TOY_PON32> Athena: No Twitter is bad!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So the way I see it, a viewer opens up the theater page, and it loads the embed instantly and the chat client...
<Shizuka> 13this channel doesn't have nearly enough wub
<ekips> i'd like to know how exactly they come up with the chaotig idead for discords actions
<Meanwhile> Wub <3
<Wrek> 05WUBWUBWUWBUWBWUBWUBWUWBWUWBUWBUWBUWBWUB
<TOY_PON32> Wub
<Athena> wub~
<unfoundbug> WUUUUUBWUBWUBWUB
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But each chat client gets configured for which rooms it connects to...
<PinkiePie101> WUBWUWBWUWBWWUWBWUWBWWUWBW
*Jim wubs
<kyle113> Yeah...
<MahBoi777> wub
<Wrek> 05what has science doen!?
<PinkiePie101> WUWWBWUWUBWBUUWBWWWBWUBUBW
<Rainbowjack> GN all
<Meanwhile> The wub has been quintupled.
<Wrek> 05once is enough pinkie
<MirrorImage> Wrek - wubbly thins
<PinkiePie101> WUBWUBWUWBWUBWUWBWUBW
<ekips> Well, I'd like to express my utmost wub at this very moment
*MahBoi777 fires wub cannon
*PinkiePie101 exploded
*TOY_PON32 wubs everypony
<Moop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=qngalLRjhUM
<TOY_PON32> :3
<PinkiePie101> SOMEONE WUB MY BACK
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So you would have 6 separate IRC chat embeds that would connect to only one of each of the pony rooms (one for just Fluttershy, one for just Applejack, etc.)
*unfoundbug adds some dum to the wub
<MahBoi777> dat wub
<MahBoi777> wub mah belly!
<TOY_PON32> haha Dat kick
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Shizuka> 13i'll ask saturn, he's building the new theater page
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Then have the site just swap to each of them on refresh.
<Jim> Good news everypony, I was just informed about what science have done. http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lo4c74firK1qjmjvko1_400.jpg
<MasterBrony> G4 ponies - pure gold G3.5 ponies - pure evil
<MahBoi777> :D
<Shizuka> 13but yeah i see where you're going with that
<ToasterLicker> EW
<Wrek> 05tiem for por... i mean sleep
<Wrek> 05nn!
<Meanwhile> Good news everyone, I fixed the poison slime pipes!
<Queen_Rarity> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFimgKJaZM
<TOY_PON32> Oh btw Meanwhile they will tire out soon
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But, if it can be done, setup a cookie that stops the code from doing it for the user.
<unfoundbug> damnit, i read that in the professors voice
<Meanwhile> Night Wrek
<MahBoi777> Wrek: why not both? LOL
<TOY_PON32> later Wrek
<Ouroboros> Sleep well Wrek
<Jim> good night Wrek
<Kimori> I rarly use live messenger
<MahBoi777> Later Wrek
<unfoundbug> night wrek

<ToasterLicker> MicTheMicrophone...creator
<PinkiePie101> oh yeah this is awesome.

<Kimori> but at the time it looked like it couldive been a better thing than here
<Moop> best rapper
<fillyfillyy> only 7o'clock here

<PinkiePie101> LOL!
<Athena> Oh toodles Wrek~
<Dken2021> has she tried not being trixie?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02It will spread the load evenly across each room instead of filling up one room with 1200 viewers and then another room with 200 users.
<Moop> why do the voices sound sooo similar?
<Athena> (late goodbye is late .-.)
*MahBoi777 resumes eating KFC
<kyle113> Yeah agreed...I dont go on much either

<MahBoi777> TOY_PON32: it's so delicious:'(
<ben1994> oh god
<Ouroboros> What was the significance of "12 men on the field"?
<TOY_PON32> Tom Brady you will die if you lose!

<PinkiePie101> ._.
<ben1994> god the crud that is streaming is getting worse
<ekips> this is priceless
<SuperBrony64> 10,02The way I see it working, although I'm not extremely savy with programming, is the code constantly counts up while dividing by 6, then use the remainder to select which room the viewer gets in.
<Artemis> heya :p
<Xanbreon> Cheers
<Xanbreon> BEtter
<Ouroboros> Watching the BBC stream of it, miss out on the ads unfortunately but they do add in extra explanation
<Dken2021> oh look, a strong independant black M&N who needs no man
<Artemis> :3
<Meanwhile> Wait UK openeing?
<Artemis> how are you?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Well, I mean, which IRC chat embed to use
<MahBoi777> oh noes!
<Meanwhile> We don't talk like that!
<MirrorImage> Meanwhile - it was a joke
<PinkiePie101> "This video has been removed by the user"
<TOY_PON32> Nekkid M&M
<PinkiePie101> wut
<Moop> http://my10online.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Shetland_pony.jpg
<Xanbreon> High as a kite, so good
<ekips> oh look acta strikes again
<Armageddon> XD
<Xanbreon> Hows you?
<Athena> Time for food~
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Each IRC chat embed will only have access to one room.
<Armageddon> You're like Altair
<Meanwhile> Nobody here sounds like that!
<bear2229> hello
<Shizuka> 13yeah that sounds about right
<Armageddon> he gets high a lot
<Meanwhile> At all!
<Armageddon> either that or drunk
<MirrorImage> hence, the joke
<PinkiePie101> .___.
<TOY_PON32> I created poniez
<Armageddon> I'm fine
<Armageddon> in class atm
<Moop> HOLY FUCKIN SHIT!
<PinkiePie101> What is this.
<Xanbreon> Sounds like a good chap
<Sneas> 03ooooooooooooooooooooooo
<Meanwhile> Jollywodgers.
<Xanbreon> Need sum whiskey
<PinkiePie101> This is EPIC
*MahBoi777 bows to TOY_PON32
<TOY_PON32> :P
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Then as soon as the pony episode finishes, just swap back to locking down the rooms and just having the main chat.
<Xanbreon> SHUN u not be learning young lady
<Moop> TIS EPIC
<PinkiePie101> IKR
<Sneas> 03o:
*PinkiePie101 loves this video
<MahBoi777> wwoohoo!
<Shizuka> 13i think that might go more with the bot to announce streams, this first run we might try the user limit and forward
<PinkiePie101> Twilight: RRAAAGGEEE
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You can even use Dari's kick all command to get everyone out, forcing them to rejoin and thus be redirected to the main channel.
<Athena> Cool video bro
<Xanbreon> :D
<Ouroboros> NYG:9 NE:0
<PinkiePie101> Awesome video bro*
<MahBoi777> Pinkie is fastest
<Athena> *ahem* Go new york Giants
<Armageddon> lmao
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yeah, I can imagine this code will take some time to work out all the bugs.
<PinkiePie101> Pinkie pie isn't faster than rainbow dash :O
<Xanbreon> YOUNG lady
<Xanbreon> >;3
<TOY_PON32> Athena: No!
<ToasterLicker> In skyrim i collect cheese
<Meanwhile> Go whoever wins. See that way I can't lose.
<Dken2021> more polar bear coke ads?
<PinkiePie101> Whoa.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But maybe an idea that can be saved for BronyState 2.0.
<MahBoi777> PinkiePie101: I dunno, she seemed to keep up with her in Party of One
<Dken2021> thought they be done with them
<Moop> HOW DO EARTH PONIES WRIGHT BOOKS?
<Meanwhile> In Skyrim what I collect depends on which character.
<Meanwhile> Rite*
<Armageddon> xD
<GiantLawnchair> Is anyone watching the game?
<Meanwhile> Write*
<PinkiePie101> WHAT THE
<Armageddon> so, whatcha doin'?
<TOY_PON32> Personally I love the Stellers but whatever
<Meanwhile> Infernal W key.
<Dken2021> I'm sorta
<Xanbreon> So, hows life in, aussie land
<alexxm> with their mouths Moop
<Xanbreon> Errh, in what sence
<GiantLawnchair> If so, holy crap, did you see that safety that the Patriots did!?
<Xanbreon> Apart from the getting high of cause
<PinkiePie101> the fuq is this
<Jim> Ohai Fluttershy
<Xanbreon> I am ircing
<GiantLawnchair> This is a great game!
<Xanbreon> Listening to awseomness
<ekips> vote for skip ~.~
<PinkiePie101> OH CRAP IT'S COMING CLOSER
<Xanbreon> http://youtuberepeater.com/watch?v=7eJ_TmsHnC8&name=Viking+Ponies
<CriticKitten> Pats, safety, wut?
<MahBoi777> Moop: mmmmagic *snort snort*
<Xanbreon> AWSEOMENSSS SQUEE
<Moop> C is for creepy
<Jim> These videos get old after a while
<Xanbreon> And im typing, nonsence
<MirrorImage> ok... Chevy just did a commercial for their truck where it rained frogs...
<Athena> It's going to hop out of your screen anytime soon...
<Xanbreon> but not much, you?
<MirrorImage> i question whether that was a reference or not
<ben1994> *snuggle*
<PinkiePie101> IT'S COMING EVEN CLOSER
<kyle113> Going to be gone for a few...BBL
<TOY_PON32> Ugh
<PinkiePie101> NOOOOOO
<Meanwhile> MirrorImage: raining frogs is a true occurence. Also salmon.
<Tenure> ah the half-time show tradition of showing 90-year-old has-beens
<Dken2021> and twinkies!
<TOY_PON32> Fuck you Patriots
<MahBoi777> extreme closeup! brace yourselves!
<MasterBrony> salutory brohoof
<PinkiePie101> GET READY FOR A HUGE CLOSEUP
<SuperBrony64> 10,02The other idea I had was making a bot to help out with YouTube requests in #Vinyl_Scratch
<Krakass> It's not the Patriot's fault they can't count to 12.
<alexxm> is this a screamer
<Queen_Rarity> I love Patriots <3
<ben1994> no
<Moop> TOY_PON32: STFU
<Meanwhile> No this is a bedroom eyes.
<MahBoi777> nah, no screamer\
<PinkiePie101> .__.
<Dken2021> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-ponies-favorite-football-players.jpg
<TOY_PON32> It's not like I want them to lose!!!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02First though, it would be nice to limit the number of messages sent to that room per user to be like one per 5 min or something.
<The_4th_Wall> *offers a cupcake in greetings
<TOY_PON32> :|
<SuperBrony64> 10,02once*
<Meanwhile> Dken2021: I don't know any of those people.
<alexxm> ok reminds me of one though
<Moop> ok then dont be an ass about them
<PinkiePie101> IT'S COMING EVEN CLOSER :O
<Dken2021> me neither, but whatever
<ToasterLicker> wow im watching the ads
<MahBoi777> Trollestia!
<PinkiePie101> It's done?
<Dken2021> thought some peole would know
<PinkiePie101> What the
<Shizuka> 13dari might be able to work that out
<Meanwhile> Dat flailing.
<PinkiePie101> TAKE OFF AND PONY
<TOY_PON32> Moop I am an ass you should know that by now
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Second, having a bot that can report to a separate room that the stream can view that shows the link posted along with a message similar to what Steven_Magnet posts.
<PinkiePie101> :O
<SuperBrony64> 10,02streamer*
<alexxm> fluttershy is best magikarp
<PinkiePie101> I think I've seen this before..
<MahBoi777> LOL
<SuperBrony64> 10,02It can help in seeing what the video will be beforehand so that troll videos don't go up on stream.
<Meanwhile> Fluttershy used splash, if that's ok with you...
<PinkiePie101> dat sweetie belle
*TOY_PON32 is best plot
<Moop> TOY_PON32: I have not paid attention to u until know
<Moop> now*
<ben1994> wow that quality is rly bad....
<MahBoi777> :D
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I do check them, but it would be faster to see the name of it and, if possible, the like/dislike ratio.
<Armageddon> lamo
<PinkiePie101> woah
<Armageddon> lmao
<Armageddon> I'm in class
<TOY_PON32> Moop: Wow that hurted a bit....
<ekips> ben1994: who cares about quality when it is about ponies?
<Armageddon> just finished
<DiscordKing> push
<PinkiePie101> this is kinda getting off pitch.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But I doubt the ratio can be shown from a bot.
<ToasterLicker> OH GAWD...m&m commercial D:
<Jim> I'll have to ask them where I can buy the toaster they used to record this with
<bear2229> thanks :$
<ben1994> well if its pixilated than i care
<Moop> TOY_PON32: sorry :(

<ekips> you have a friend called "lyra the lustful lesbian"?
<MahBoi777> Beers and guns guns and Beer! YEEHAW
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Anyway, until he responds, the way I see it working is viewers post their requests in #Vinyl_Scratch, the bot takes the link, identifies it with the name and then reports it in a separate room that only the streamer (and other mods if wanted) can enter.
<Meanwhile> ekips yeah she got banned from mane chat.
<ToasterLicker> ekips you saw nothing
*SuperBrony64 is nommed O___o
<TOY_PON32> ekips is interested

<Meanwhile> My Skyrim crashes sometimes for reasons I have yet to discover. But nothing particularly breaking.
<unfoundbug> hes not in game
<Athena> Nittany_Discord: I can only see your steam window my friend~
<pony_3508> pc, yes, and im not the only one with the problem
<TOY_PON3> dat Steam window
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<unfoundbug> might try and record this
<diddutz> u running L4D in fullscreen?
<Shizuka> 13MX records basically right?
<PinkiePie101> dat warhammer ad
<Shizuka> 13in addition to the proper software
<Silver_Rush> i have a question
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. Was about to fix that.
<Meanwhile> Shoot.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bear with me.
*TOY_PON3 wishes he had L4D so he could join Nittany_Discord :(
<Silver_Rush> anyone know where a RP thing is?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But you can't change certain things.
<pony_3508> been on many forums, some say its broken save, some problems with textures... but I havent got any CTD problems untill latest patch...
<Shizuka> 13free tier gives you 5 addresses according to their page
<diddutz> Nittany_Discord, try windowed mode using the start-parameter -noborder
<Meanwhile> Silver_Rush: try google.
<PinkiePie101> I wish I had L4D
<TOY_PON3> ^
<PinkiePie101> Oh well, I'll just watch.

<Shizuka> 13or put livestream into game mode
<Shizuka> 13^ will probably work better
<SuperBrony64> 10,02We going to continue with them or are we researching new web hosts? If not, what about the possibility of paying for the premium membership? It's only $5 a month.
<Shizuka> 13yreah on 000

*LadyCanary hugs everyone. ^_^
<MirrorImage> that's cause the game hasn't started yet
*SuperBrony64 hugs LadyCanary
<Meanwhile> SuperSlowbrony strikes again.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hai :3
*TOY_PON3 hugs LadyCanary back
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. Steam hates streaming games fullscreen.
<LadyCanary> Dat SuperBrony64.
<TOY_PON3> ^
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Ohai :3
<unfoundbug> l4d2 has an option in game for fullscreen borderless
<PinkiePie101> So, I heard you like arrows ^
<Athena> Dat SB
<LadyCanary> Might I ask who is streaming?
<Shizuka> 13nittany is streaming <3
<Ouroboros> Apparently that player tore his anterior cruciate ligament, one of the ones that stabilises the knee joint
<PinkiePie101> Mhm
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Killing stream for a bit.
<Moop> MUST WATCH: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=7BVvNE78lyc
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Indeed, if just 5 of us chip in, it's only $1 from each of us.
<MirrorImage> unless you have L4D2 superbrony and you take main control of the stream
<LadyCanary> :O Really!! That's awesome Nittany_Discord!!

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Plus, we get unlimited storage and bandwidth, which can be used for hosting our newsletter (nothing wrong with what we have now, but a perk we get nevertheless).
*Meanwhile soothes LadyCanary. "there there. It's only mostly your fault"
<LadyCanary> ;^; wah.....
<Shizuka> 13was? es ist not canary's fault :<
<TOY_PON3> :D

*Meanwhile puts LadyCanary in a potato sack.
<unfoundbug> i wonder if there is a ponyvilled l4d2 map
<PinkiePie101> ._.
<Meanwhile> Sack of blame.
<PinkiePie101> XD
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Not sure if we can do it, but just throwing a random idea out there. We could use that unlimited bandwidth/storage as a private stream solution.
<MirrorImage> i'm sure there is somewhere unfoundbug
<Meanwhile> Sit in it and think about what you did.
<Queen_Rarity> We need to push *blaming otkn* as new meme
<TOY_PON3> dat sack of blame
*LadyCanary cries in the sack of blame.
<Shizuka> 13well, "unlimited" there's always some hard limit they complain to you at, but if we're running pony eps off the free tier we're probably well below that
<LadyCanary> D:
<PinkiePie101> ._.
<TOY_PON3> World Problems? Blame otkn
<Athena> You made LadyCanary cry... What have you done.
<TOY_PON3> LadyCanary no cry :'(
<Meanwhile> I made LadyCanary cry. Why ask if you know already?
*Athena gets LadyCanary out of the bag and hugs her~
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Should be up now.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Well, we're not though
*unfoundbug cries into webcam "Leave LadyCanary ALONE!"
<Shizuka> 13we've got zombie siiiiiiiign
<TOY_PON3> Meanwhile is to blame!
<Mutterguy> I think you answered your own rhetorical question
<Moop> OFFLINE :'(
<Queen_Rarity> Fillies cry? otkn
<LadyCanary> I can breathe!
<unfoundbug> niiice
<bear2229> yay l4d2
<PinkiePie101> finally
<Meanwhile> Errday I'm blamin.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02We use LiveStream and other stream providers as the bandwidth.
<Moop> yes!
<LadyCanary> And ooh L4D.
*Meanwhile shuffles.
<ekips> ah there we go
<PinkiePie101> dat lag
<Moop> there is an MLP version of this
<Diftraku> Honestly
<Shizuka> 13well yeah, but like page loads, since streams will still be iframes offsite
<Diftraku> The "unlimited" is what's scaring me lff
<Diftraku> *off
<MirrorImage> lets give that mutation a shot
<TOY_PON3> Moop: There is an MLP version of mostly everything now o.o
<LadyCanary> There's an MLP version of a LOT of things.
<LadyCanary> Dammit.
<PinkiePie101> ikr
<Athena> Ditto
<Meanwhile> No Lovefilm for the millionth time I don't want you. At all.
<MirrorImage> 8 special infected and an increased spawn rate
<TOY_PON3> LadyCanary got ninja'd
<TOY_PON3> ;)
<Moop> TOY_PON3: dat true
<LadyCanary> Feh :P
<CriticKitten> Waitwaitwait, otakon is making fillies cry again?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I do agree as well, $5 for 'unlimited' seems like too good of a deal.
<TOY_PON3> hehe
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I was going to do the mutation.
<Meanwhile> Not on my watch!
<Shizuka> 13always is
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But it's only 4-player.
*Meanwhile flies out of the window with a cape on.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But we're not generating traffic just yet like EqD and can use it until the need for a new host arises.
<MirrorImage> is that an issue, or do we have enough to fill a versus lobby?
<Athena> How about VS? Or a server that allows more than 4 people.
<unfoundbug> We should get a proper count
<TOY_PON3> so many car commercials..
<Queen_Rarity> Ikke på min klokke!
<Meanwhile> find one of those 32 player servers
<Moop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=1CMOrn3wXSg
<diddutz> I would like to join!
<Shizuka> 13right, and afaik shared hosts would email you saying "hey, we're unlimited, but not THAT unlimited and here's where you're doing too much"
<kirz|zombies> 1,3mp server didn't end well last time lol
*TOY_PON3 still wishes he could join :(
<SuperBrony64> 10,02We still have yet for imgur to yell at us about bandwidth use with the newsletter, so I think we're good for now.
<PinkiePie101> I wish I could join
<kirz|zombies> 1,3winning team: whoever met the witch last
<PinkiePie101> But I don't have L4D :[
<TOY_PON3> Same here
<Shizuka> 13imgur is reddit affiliated though, they've got serious power
*TOY_PON3 is poor
<TOY_PON3> :3
<PinkiePie101> ._.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll start collecting names for a VS. game.
<unfoundbug> Nittany_Discord: may i add?
<LadyCanary> Nor do I.
