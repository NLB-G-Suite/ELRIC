<Crimson_Phoenix> was it Ponies47?
<Dken2021> hai Emmie
<Vordox> Want suggestions SuperBrony64 ?
<sub06905> ello Emmie
<Emmie> Hi guys.
<Pinkies4thWall> SuperBrony64: i agree with Crimson_Phoenix. i have to see the brony ep, too.
<Emmie> Pinkes4thWall: There's a brony episode? D:
<Spell-of-Gaming> I don't think the brony episode exists
<Dr_Fumbles> K, night everypony :)
<Emmie> I just see that making such a worse impression of the community. :<
<Dken2021> nighty Dr_Fumbles
<Ponies47> Crimson_Phoenix: Rumor had it. It was gonna be the Season premier of whaterver season it was (15 I think) they we're wrong.
<Emmie> Oh dear.
<Emmie> It's going to be like some infectious disease thing.
<Ponies47> THERE IS NO BRONY EPISODE OF SOUTH PARK
<Crimson_Phoenix> Ponies47, what was the title?
<Emmie> Or they might take the weird fetish route.
<Pinkies4thWall> I seem to remember hearing about one... :S
<Emmie> :(
<SuperBrony64> 11,02There's a brony episode?
<Crimson_Phoenix> SuperBrony64, it seems not
<Emmie> SuperBrony64 Apparently there will be? o.o
<Pinkies4thWall> Crimson_Phoenix: y u strt so much hubbub?
<Dken2021> don't worry , I doubt matt and trey would even think about doing it
<twilight_sprinkle> oh im definitely sure theyll make one
<Crimson_Phoenix> Pinkies4thWall, cause I was interested in that one time I saw something about it
<Spell-of-Gaming> SuperBrony64: Can you show another show? :P
<P4ngya> im sure it will be very disturbing
<twilight_sprinkle> theyll run out of ther stuff to reference eventually
<Crimson_Phoenix> didn't know it was a rumor
<twilight_sprinkle> and mlp is hella famous, so theyll undoubtedly do it eventually
<Sylandest> if south park does a brony episode...i dont know what to expect
<Spell-of-Gaming> I have a solution to the "there's no brony episode" problem
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 play me song
<Vangash> Who cares whether or not they make it we've gone through worse and besides South Park makes fun of everything
<Pinkies4thWall> So, I ate an oyster on saturday.
<Dken2021> how was it?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Take the Chinpokomon episode, replace every word of Chinpokomon and anything related to it as pony. Done. :3

<Pinkies4thWall> dat boop
<twilight_sprinkle> Spell-of-Gaming: there was the Japanese thing tho
<Emmie> Spell-Of-Gaming, You realize they could turn it into some weird fetish
<Emmie> :C
<sub06905> SuperBrony64: will you be doing youtube requests anytime soon since they were cut short due to the podcast?
<Emmie> But whatever, at least we can laugh at ourselves
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah, if only south park were funny..
<Emmie> lol
<pony_6346> whats going on?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I have the solution to the Japanese problemn
<Emmie> ?
<twilight_sprinkle> Spell-of-Gaming: rreplace Japan with Usa?
<Spell-of-Gaming> twilight_sprinkle: That and...

<Crimson_Phoenix> I actually forgot about that one
<Vordox> Crimson_Phoenix: So yeah... Trust me, Fusion = Second best Metroid :P
<Crimson_Phoenix> since it's so horrible
<Vangash> Why does this person put exclemation points after each sentence?! They must love to yell a lot!
<Marx> Vordox, Hunters is pretty much the only Metroid game I haven't played.
<Dken2021> welp, samus just landed on a space station, $10 says it doesn't blow up
<Emmie> prince-dari i feel dumb for actually believing you were 12 now.
<prince-dari> Heheheh.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Hunters seemed like an awesome game for DS
<Crimson_Phoenix> Vordox, I wouldn't say fusion being the second best
<Ponies47> prince-dari: Dang O_O
*Ponies47 Is 14
<Daygon> ;)
<Vordox> Honestly, I rate the top 5 like this. Super Metroid, Fusion, Metroid 2, Metroid Prime 1. Metroid 1
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Does it have something to do with the 'baby' since she kept mentioning it every 5 seconds in Other M?
<Pinkies4thWall> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: it was
<Crimson_Phoenix> I mean we have Super Metroid and Metroid Prime
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: AS I SAID; focus on the game, IGNORE THE CHAT
<Spectrum_Rush> prince-dari: you're 17... and your voice is already that sexy... lucky git ¬-¬
<Emmie> SO HOW MANY OF YOU GUYS CAN ALWAYS FLIP IN THE AIR WHILE JUMPING.
<Crimson_Phoenix> I still say Fusion was weak
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dari is 17 and mah waifu already.
<Kandarihu> The first time I ever called Nintendo customer support and info, their hold music was an ad for Super Metroid. It just started with "SHE'S BAAAAACK!" and ended with the audio of a boss battle.
<Daygon> baby
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> SB64 just dmg yourself
<Crimson_Phoenix> Good thing about that game though
<Tyler_The_creator> NO WAY
<Spectrum_Rush> :O SuperBrony64 you pedo
<Spell-of-Gaming> If I'm not mistaken, they left Metroid to Nintendo of America or am I just being stupid?
<Crimson_Phoenix> the horror ambience and Nightmare
<Vordox> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: And this is why I told you to NOT read the chat
<Marx> Kick his butt!
<Vordox> >.>
*Pinkies4thWall has only played the prime games and hunters
<Marx> Awww.
<Tyler_The_creator> He's seriously playing supermetriod?
<Tyler_The_creator> or this is jus a video?>

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Vordox: i wasnt spoiling, i was telling him how to do it fast
<Dken2021> but it's gonna explosde
<Jmo4267> Vordox has a point.
<sub06905> :D
<Vangash> On noez! I dropped my gum gotta go back!
<Vordox> This game is about EXPLORATION
<Marx> Well, he has time. It is possible to get out of there in 20 seconds.
<Vordox> And you do that YOURSELF
<Jmo4267> ^
<Crimson_Phoenix> I agree with Vordox
<Crimson_Phoenix> and Fusion wasn't about exploration :P
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> nah
<Tyler_The_creator> Ponies kept me up until 2AM. I'm off to bed. Night everyone.
<AdamTheDuck> Dat timer
<Dken2021> nighty Tyler_The_creator

<Daygon> save the baby metroid
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> SB always trolls =/
<Vangash> Who desiged this place I mean did they expect everypony to have strenght increasing armor?
<Syn_Virtu> lol
<Crimson_Phoenix> and yeah I knew it was too good to be true
<Vordox> Crimson_Phoenix: I liked it for it's Story AND the f''cking monsters. Remember Baby Voice? =P
<Kandarihu> I thought you played this before. I would've thought you'd make it past Ceres
<Crimson_Phoenix> Vordox, Nightmare
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek dis game :3c
<Crimson_Phoenix> and I agree
<Vordox> Crimson_Phoenix: Indeed.

<Spell-of-Gaming> I think Derpy is playing
<Crimson_Phoenix> since for me it wasn't really metroid
<Emmie> GOTTA GO FAST
<prince-dari> Sanic
<Marx> I wonder if there's a similar fail scene for the end of Super Metroid.
<Dken2021> no wait, I don't remember this
<Emmie> UH OH
<Spell-of-Gaming> Santanic
<Vordox> Crimson_Phoenix: Super MEtroid for it's exploration and new world <3 With details. Fusion for it's Story and fleshing out Samus' character, Metroid 2 for it's UNGODLY Metroid history, Prime for the world information and it's atmosphere, Metroid 1 for the very first big thing
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> wth
<Jmo4267> ily Vordox.

<Dken2021> nighty Daygon
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:D
<Vordox> So much murder in this game :D
<Crimson_Phoenix> Vordox, and I just go with Exploration as my number 1 factor
<Spell-of-Gaming> SuperBrony64: I AM JELLY
<Vordox> Crimson_Phoenix: Fusion had exploration too. :P
<Crimson_Phoenix> Vordox, it was basically GO THERE
<Vordox> Just that it was stricter then Super Metroid
<Crimson_Phoenix> and DO THIS THERE
<Vangash> Is this like catching the purple dragon?
<Vordox> Less ways of screwing upt the planned line
<Vordox> Crimson_Phoenix: Story in metroid with was decent = Good :P
<Vordox> And heck, we learned of Zero Suit Samus in that game
<Vordox> Not to mention the final boss <3 My god what a shock that was
<Crimson_Phoenix> Look Vordox You can't change my opinion about mine
<Vordox> I'm not
<Syn_Virtu> i dont get this game what do you do?
<Vordox> I'm explaining why I love Fusion :P

<Vordox> I was playing games on my NES back in the day

<Crimson_Phoenix> sometimes it was brown
<Vordox> Most of you don't even KNOW what that is
<Crimson_Phoenix> other times Green
<Crimson_Phoenix> I even had Purple once
<Crimson_Phoenix> now that was fun
<Vordox> You know what's fun Crimson_Phoenix ...?
<MASF123> Kick HIS ASS
<Crimson_Phoenix> Power Reset blow in the cartridge part of the NES?
<Vordox> Crimson_Phoenix: Remember the "Scripted talk" in Megmana X Egoraptor part?
<Vordox> About bos health and stufF?
<Vordox> boss*
<MASF123> Make Ridley your BITCH
<Crimson_Phoenix> I'll need to watch it one more time
<Vordox> Also "Unable to help/save/beat something, and with Larva as the victim?)
<Sumica> 00,10heheh, suddenly reminded of streaming aliens
<Vordox> I love this tilt

<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek metroid :3c

<Crimson_Phoenix> Vordox, I'm sorry I haven't
<Sumica> 00,10on aliens Kandarihu, I played the excape theme in the background when Riply was runing from the nest.
<Crimson_Phoenix> I heard about the metroid phase though
<Vordox> Crimson_Phoenix: Take a look at a video of it

<SuperBrony64> 11,02OH
<Crimson_Phoenix> and exploration like in Metroid?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02okie :3
<Vordox> Also, the larva comes from Metroid 2, which caused me to love the Super Metroid even more
<Dken2021> but in platformers, you're suppose to go right
<Sumica> 00,10Some how I am not supprised
<MASF123> Is like Castlevania minus the demons and Dracula
<Vordox> Now you are jus trolling everyone Super Brony :P If you ask for people to help you we'll ruin the game for oyu
<Vordox> FECK IT! I'm pushing my stereos to the max for the music and SFXs.
<Kandarihu> I'm not even the biggest complainer anymore, though.
<Spectrum_Rush> Vordox: man just the atmosphere right now its just...
<MASF123> morph ball
<Vordox> Spectrum_Rush: Increase the stereos and listen....
<MASF123> damn

<Crimson_Phoenix> SuperBrony64, Sillyness might be fun here and there but there are games that it doesn't work
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: That was the guide on where to go unless you wish to break the line of game already :P
<Kandarihu> Gotta love it when a video game sequel takes you back to the ruins of where the first game took place.
<thegt90> oh i have this on wii fun game still havent betten it on a count of one certain boss that remains to be a pain in my ass

<Crimson_Phoenix> that's why I cringe everytime he's pretending to be stupid
<MASF123> So many secrets in this game many of which drive some peeps insane
<thegt90> this one http://i33.tinypic.com/1z4yagy.png
<Spectrum_Rush> prince-dari: increases the capacity

<Quick_Thinker> well i checked the site and the order is still processing
<TrixieMuffins> oh i get it , the dead guy at the start is the clone ?
<Wrek> 05mhm
<Quick_Thinker> where is welovefine located?
<Wrek> 05us
<Quick_Thinker> there company that is
<Quick_Thinker> where in the US?
<Wrek> 05dunno
<Quick_Thinker> hm time to do some research
<Quick_Thinker> i live in Indiana
<Quick_Thinker> so lets do some diggin
<Wrek> 05atleast you live IN the US
<TrixieMuffins> but if thats the case , why does the dead guy look like adult trip ? does the clone not grow older than the host ? will flux trip up ? (dat pun)
<Wrek> 05for me ovcer here
<Wrek> 05it takes considerably longer time
<Wrek> 05trip is in a coma
<Wrek> 05they grew a clone using that symbiot
<Wrek> 05sim is that clone
<Quick_Thinker> huh now that im think i probely should have gotten the derpy backpack but i am more of Twilight fan
<Quick_Thinker> DUN DUN
*JRP2234 slaps Quick_Thinker around a bit with a large trout
<Quick_Thinker> stop that
<TrixieMuffins> yes , but at the start of the episode there was dead trip , i suspect thats the clone , question is then why does it look like dead adult trip , not like dead old age trip . i thought the clone lives trough hisnatural lifecycle
<Quick_Thinker> huh did not know Trixie was sci fi kind of pony :D
<JRP2234> today i made the most unsal stament today
<Wrek> 05he wasnt dead
<Wrek> 05he was hurt
<Wrek> 05and put in a coma
<TrixieMuffins> yes , but this is flashback after the funeral scene right ?
<Quick_Thinker> Trixie when did you get into sci fi ?
<Wrek> 05what funeral?
<TrixieMuffins> at the start of the episode , i might be totally off , didnt pay all that muchattention
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: before the intro
<Quick_Thinker> his memories are full of ponys he has a good chance
<Quick_Thinker> DEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Quick_Thinker> bass cannon XD
<Quick_Thinker> is it getting rusty or something?
<Wrek> 05covered in magnetic dust
<TrixieMuffins> flew into a shitstorm , now its crusting over
<Chrysalis> but then youll decelerate
<Chrysalis> your in a cloud theres material to collide against
<TrixieMuffins> aha thats why
<JRP2234> wrek ban me for a hour
<Chrysalis> thats.... odd
<Wrek> 05he is a very odd fella
<Chrysalis> sabotage incoming
<TrixieMuffins> i wonder what happens to the clone once he reaches the coma point , will he fall into acoma aswell ?
<Wrek> 05nope
<Wrek> 05casue the coma isnt casued genetically
<Quick_Thinker> but wont he just grow so old he will turn to dust?
<Wrek> 05mhm
<Quick_Thinker> or just die from old age to be more realistic
<TrixieMuffins> neither are memories like the ones hes getting , but the way thisis presented hes gonna get coma memories, and might psychosomaticly be affected
<Wrek> 05i dunno
<TrixieMuffins> smoochyboochy
<Wrek> 05i guess the memories are inprinted in a way some how and were copied over when they took the sample to grow him in the first place
*Chrysalis slaps t'pal upside the head
<Chrysalis> stop interupting science!
<P0N-3_L0V3R> lol
<Quick_Thinker> im voting for the best pony on we lovefine i've been through 200 fluttershys MY ADORABLE METER CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE
<Wrek> 05there's your funeral
<Chrysalis> hes pretty much at his own funeral
<Quick_Thinker> odd
<Quick_Thinker> so he has none of the memories of him from that
<TrixieMuffins> clone probabl deleted all his porn as a little revenge
<RoboGerbil> that pizzas pretty fresh for being in the bathroom overnight
<Flyboy> erm...

<TrixieMuffins> how are the aliens even having any money ? and a warehouse ? on earth !
<Wrek> 05but human
<Wrek> 05too much backstory for me to explain so it makes sense
<Neron643> what are we watching
<Marsh> OH, can we watch dr.who later?
<Neron643> what are we watching
<Marsh> some star trek thing
<RoboGerbil> stupid time travel without the doctor
<Zawan> yes take the alien to pre warp earth
<Marsh> i don't see how anything could go wrong
<RoboGerbil> what could possibly go wrong?
<Chrysalis> Zawan the alien whos species was interferring with our development for a LONG time
<RoboGerbil> and then the silence shows up
<Zawan> still...
<Chrysalis> and pushed back development at warp by at least 100 years
<alexxm> you didn't answer her question
<pony_5642> you should think that they would be able to use technology which is totally outdated from their own :P
<Quick_Thinker> its like drivers ed all ovr again ARGGGGGGGGGGG RAGE CRUSH KILL DESTROY 1.0 to hte 2.0
<Marsh> they've like...never seen a car...thus they don't know how to drive one
<[Alpha]> hmm
<RoboGerbil> lol jump in the car with a stanger
<TrixieMuffins> supply nearing depletion with 60 years left of supplies and a growing consumpion rate ? hardly makes sense
<Flyboy> oh god, the trekkie line...
<glennglog22> i have a problem with the stream showing up
<alexxm> you don't say
<glennglog22> it says sorry the requesed channel cant embedded on this domain name
<Phase4> glennglog22, whats happening instead?
<Phase4> glennglog22, opera user?
<glennglog22> Reason: Domain protection enabled by broadcaster.
<glennglog22> no
<glennglog22> google chrome user
<Phase4> what browser?
<Phase4> strange
<Phase4> that happens when you have referers disabled
<glennglog22> normally google chrome would let it work
<Phase4> its common for opera users who turn it off for some reason
<Phase4> do you have firefox installed?
<glennglog22> no. i have only 2 browsers.
<glennglog22> the worst one
<glennglog22> and the good one
<glennglog22> internet explorer 9
<Phase4> any extentions installed in chrome?
<RoboGerbil> vulcan neck pinch
<glennglog22> nope
<Marsh> neck pinch XD
<glennglog22> just flash and java
<glennglog22> Reason: Domain protection enabled by broadcaster.
<Phase4> not behind a proxy?
<TrixieMuffins> vulcan nipple twist
<glennglog22> nope
<Marsh> oh dear god....
<Phase4> well something is turning it off
<pony_5642> vulcan crotch kick
<glennglog22> how do i re-enable referers
<glennglog22> on chrome
<Phase4> i'm looking that up now
<glennglog22> ok
<Phase4> try ctrl+f5, might be a once off issue
<TrixieMuffins> 5 finger pressure point heart explosion technique (vulcan)
<glennglog22> ok
<pony_5642> (just died)
<TheRandomkid321> 3 bad things happened today. I found out my mate HATES ponies, My mate got hit by a car, I lost my drivers liscence.
<pony_5642> lol :P
<Marsh> you hit him with a car didn't you?
<Rain> Greg(the vulcan)'s 5 point presentation on finances!

<TheRandomkid321> BACON!
<[Alpha]> Damn
<TrixieMuffins> inb4 they put cheese on it and we stumble into Dan vs. Burgerphile
<[Alpha]> I'm hungry now
<glennglog22> hi everypony!
<Marsh> hello
<[Alpha]> Greetings
<alexxm> how you doing glennglog22
<flutter_spin> been awhile since I woke up this early. What's streaming?
<Dark_Horst> wait.... how'D he do that
<[Alpha]> Wrek is
<glennglog22> good
<glennglog22> guess what?
<[Alpha]> That guy seems really nice
<flutter_spin> Because so far I narrowed down that it isn't Star Trek Enterprise or Quantum Leap
<TheRandomkid321> I have considered working in a fast food resturant. AFter creepily loitering around at one for a few days looking at bother the employees and the customers. I think If I worked there I would put gurn my face on the oven from the stupidity I would be surreounded by.
<TheRandomkid321> God my grammar suck ass
<flutter_spin> unless it IS Enterprise and therefore...why are you streaming that?
<glennglog22> guess what?
<[Alpha]> I've worked in a fancy restaurant. it sucked
<TheRandomkid321> [Alpha] Sorrounded by snobs?
<TheRandomkid321> Needles. Ugh
<Dark_Horst> flutter_spin: it is enterprise and he'S streaming it because fun
<flutter_spin> I've never seen it
<glennglog22> i got a iphone 4 today!
<[Alpha]> No surrounded by people who did not progress in life at all. Very depressing
<TheRandomkid321> flutter_spin I unfortuanlty know where you could have potentialy gotten that name from... I'll never click on a random link my mate sent me via emal EVER again. :'(
<[Alpha]> Ummm I don't want to know :S
<Marsh> im scared....
<TheRandomkid321> [Alpha] No, No you dont. Trust me.
<Dark_Horst> looks like someone had their first run-in with meatspin recently
*glennglog22 gets shot right at the belly and passes out
<TheRandomkid321> Dark_Horst Kinda... More poniefied though... Still HORRIFYING!
<flutter_spin> oh not this again. No, TheRandomkid321. It isn't that. Sheesh, must people think its that?
<Dark_Horst> now i'm curious
<[Alpha]> :|
*glennglog22 wakes up at the hospitle
<Dark_Horst> i didnt know something like that existed
<TheMaster> meat spin is so 2003
<TheRandomkid321> flutter_spin sorry. I ddint say thats where you got it from but I said it could have been where you got it from.
<flutter_spin> I thought "Fluttershy" and "Sonic Spinball"
<TheMaster> thats barely even soul scaring anymore.
<[Alpha]> :|
<alexxm> i've become immune to stuff like that
<Dark_Horst> TheRandomkid321: i dont suppose oyu still have the url?
<TheRandomkid321> I still cannot listen to that song anymore.
<flutter_spin> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_Spinball I loved that game by the way :P
<TheRandomkid321> Dark_HOrst I would get banned for posting such a thing.
<TheMaster> you spin me right round?
<TheRandomkid321> And no I don't
<TheMaster> I love that song
<Dark_Horst> TheRandomkid321: pm
<TheMaster> just google it
<Dark_Horst> TheRandomkid321: you know you can do that, rightß
<TheRandomkid321> Dark_Horst I dont have it and I have no intentions of finding it
<TheRandomkid321> Dark_Horst No actually I dont
<Dark_Horst> i tried google. only results i get are on youtube
<TheMaster> you won't find it on youtube lul
<Dark_Horst> and nothing even remotely horrifying
<TheMaster> why don't you just try adding a .com to it
<Marsh> you sure? i find alot of things terrifying
<Dark_Horst> TheRandomkid321: right click on the name in the list in the right hand and open query. for future reference
<[Alpha]> I don't
<flutter_spin> ...or just double click the name, Dark_Horst
<Dark_Horst> or that
<TheRandomkid321> I still have 0 intentions of spreading such horrifying material
<TheMaster> its not that bad
<flutter_spin> ^^ good
<flutter_spin> I've ignored more people that way
<TheMaster> there are worse things out there.
<Buytoast> oh no, it has a penis, it's a sin against humanity
<Dark_Horst> TheMaster: it's never that easy
<Buytoast> how horrifying
<[Alpha]> :|
<TheRandomkid321> Its fluttershy though.
<TheMaster> mostly what weird me out is their skin color.
<TheMaster> its a weird sort of yellow
<TheRandomkid321> Fluttershy should NOT have a penis
<TheMaster> but maybe thats just bad resolution
<Dark_Horst> so yeah, does anyone have a link to that? i wont be able to rest until i know the truth
<JRP2234> there we go
<[Alpha]> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4040/ this should change the subject
<TheRandomkid321> Wait how da buck did the chat come to this state. Oh as usual it was my doing.
<TheMaster> google it
<Dark_Horst> doesnt work
<TheMaster> what did you type into google.
<flutter_spin> This only happens when I login the morning too
<TheMaster> I tried it, it was the first link
<Marsh> Alpha, ha
<Marsh> made me laugh
<[Alpha]> :P
<JRP2234> dont worry wrek
<Dark_Horst> TheMaster: location probably. google com references not the same as google de
<Dark_Horst> TheMaster: but if you found it, care to pm me?
<TheMaster> lol okay
<[Alpha]> Well I got to do something to help
<flutter_spin> *sigh*
<TheRandomkid321> COuld someone PM it to him already. I dont wanna
<Wrek> 05stop talking about meatspin already
<[Alpha]> could you have this conversation in a p.m That would be much appreciated
<flutter_spin> In other news, my fanfiction is still waiting approval. Roughly 3,000 words completed.
<Buytoast> but i'm getting so hot and bothered
<TheMaster> whats it about?
<Chrysalis> Huh, guns of iccarus is not only getting a party system soon, but also should be getting custom games
<TheRandomkid321> COuld this convo just end already. I guess I technically started it but one message turned into a chat changer. Why does that always happen to me?
<flutter_spin> Like I said: "Not this again"
<TheMaster> no worries, it already ended
<Dark_Horst> oh... found it
<Dark_Horst> it's not THAT scary
<flutter_spin> So what number episode is this?
<TheRandomkid321> Good. Now we shall never speak of this again.
<Wrek> 0512
<Wrek> 05i run 1 dvd around this time
<cow334> god didnt know pokemon online was so hard to figure out
<cow334> ...
<flutter_spin> aw. I have like an hour before I gotta' go.
<alexxm> cow334 whats it like
<TheMaster> Wrek do you have another series planned for this?
<TheMaster> after this*
<cow334> alexxm: it's like pokem,on but online you can make your team and stuff and play with people around the world it is pretty cool to tell you the truth
<Wrek> 05TheMaster: well dari is the one playing dr who.
<flutter_spin> I've heard Enterprise was the worst, but I wouldn't know. I moved across country while it aired. I think Voyager was the last I saw.
<Wrek> 05im thinking dexter actually
<alexxm> is it free cow334
<Wrek> 05the first 2 seasons were meh
<TheMaster> woo, dexter. And I know, the name and all, but I do happen to like other stuff
<Wrek> 05the second 2 were actually good
<TheMaster> I actually really liked season 1 of dexter
<cow334> alexxm: yes
<Wrek> 05i was replying to flutter_spin regarding this breanch of star trek TheMaster :P
<TheMaster> ahh
<flutter_spin> Everytime I hear pilgrimage, I think Mass Effect
<[Alpha]> Yay the quarians
<TheRandomkid321> I am so addicted to TF2. Is there a help group for that? God my cousin would utcher me If he found out I was playing a game like that. He utterly HATES valve.
<[Alpha]> I like valve
<TheMaster> whats he have against valve?
<TheMaster> I mean, maybe it makes sense to be mad over their recent change to the EULA
<TheMaster> What class do you play in tf2?
<flutter_spin> oh no. It's one of those episodes
<[Alpha]> I was gona take a nap yesterday. i ended up sleeping for 6 hours :S
<TheRandomkid321> TheMaster Well his brother is int he military. His great grandfather was in the military. He has grown up around military knowledge. He hates any ANY unrealistick FPS games. Like COD. He like gams like Battlefield more.
<TheRandomkid321> He hates L4D too
<[Alpha]> I dislike Battlefield
<Wrek> 05so he is so wrapped around realism he cant enjoy games
<Wrek> 05then i ask
<TheMaster> That doesn't make a lot of sense to me, personally. TF2 is cartoony on purpose.
<TheRandomkid321> TheMaster I usually play as scout.
<Wrek> 05why should his oppinion matter.
<flutter_spin> Well, I'm not big on FPS. I liked Halo & Unreal Tournament. The rest... eh
<TheMaster> battlefield isn't really all that much more realistic then anything else
<Jmo4267> Unreal Tournament 2003. GET SOME!
<Buytoast> oh man, a game is differnt that reality
<TheMaster> if he wants to get mad over bad realism he should focus on strategy games
<Buytoast> how shamweful
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek well no. Just alot of games that are really unrealistick about war and guns really. It's odd.
<Wrek> 05show him arma 2 and 3
<TheRandomkid321> He liked RDR.
<[Alpha]> Who cares you can only go so far with realistic games
<Wrek> 05if he still thinks BF3 is more realistic
<TheMaster> he'd like Arma if he had a good enough comp.
<TheMaster> Though don't show him Mod Z
<TheRandomkid321> He doesnt PC game really.
<Wrek> 05then you can officially call him out on bullshitting
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek yeha I guess.
<TheRandomkid321> TheMaster He would like the Day mod. Despite being zombies not much else in unrealistick about it.
<TheRandomkid321> Day Z
<Chrysalis> dont show him DayZ but thats the best part of that game
<Jmo4267> Dat unrealistick
<TheMaster> I wish my computer could handle arma so I could kill some zombies.
<[Alpha]> :O
<TheRandomkid321> No wait with Arma 2 he would get annoyed with the AI. Apparently Its horrid.
<TheMaster> thats why you play multiplayer
<TheRandomkid321> I'm thinking of getting a PC for gaming. Mayby I could get Arma 2 and go zombie hunting ^_^
<Wrek> 05i dont like playing tf2 the boits are dumb
<Wrek> 05bots*
<Wrek> 05its a simmilar argument
<Wrek> 05now you realize how bad it sounds
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek I play online. And yes the bots do suck. hell anyone would think they where bing controlled by a COD kid playig the game.
<TheMaster> Medic is always my favorite personally
<TheRandomkid321> I play as medic a bit too. MY spray is a girl dressed up as a nurse leaning over saying "She wants you to be a medic". Because hardly anyone is ever a medic.
<Buytoast> what a dick
<Buytoast> his guy an asshole
<[Alpha]> As sppn as I got TF2 i put pony mods into it
<[Alpha]> soon
<Phase4> 00,02quiet in here
<[Alpha]> Happens Phase4
<Jmo4267> Kewl.
<BronyJenkins> Hey everypony!
<pony_5642> FREAKING TERRORISTS!
<BronyJenkins> ...
<Wrek> 05hes not a terrorist
<Wrek> 05hes a fundamentalist
<TheMaster> I wish there was a video game like Aurora that could let you recreate star trek/space exploration.
<TheMaster> that was more user friendly, I mean
<TheRandomkid321> My cousin hardly ever plays xbox anymore. He is too busy gold digging. Literally. He lives in a gold rush town and he has found a quite a bit of gold. It's a smart idea. Well. Smart for his brain. No really he has got a small problem. He can speak and function fine but he fails at even basic math.
<Buytoast> this is what you get for being kid to otehrs
<Wrek> 05inb4 pushing ctrl+z makes the data re-appear
<Dark_Horst> what a dix
<Dark_Horst> *dick
<[Alpha]> :S
<TheRandomkid321> Files deleted? DAMN YOU PRON VIRUSES!
<flutter_spin> TheMaster, called Starcontrol 2 (aka Urquan Masters remake)
<[Alpha]> So one ship will end the war?
<TheRandomkid321> Add ALL the ponies
<flutter_spin> Sorry. I was busy looking at http://www.starshipcorporation.com/ - Sort of a Spaceship creator with mockup drills. Looks really neat.
<TheRandomkid321> Aw
<TheMaster> Oh i've heard of that one.
<[Alpha]> :)
<flutter_spin> Yeah. Urquan Masters recently went free.
<flutter_spin> ok, the remake is free. The original game used to cost
<TheMaster> But I was more looking for a grand-strat sort. Like Galactic Civilization but more indepth
<flutter_spin> Wait. What was that one game that streamed here awhile back?
<Buytoast> oh man it's like The Crusades in spcae
<TheRandomkid321> I am addicted to twilight VS the walking... Damn you stairs
<cow334_gone> bye every one
<TheMaster> basically I just want them to make this more initutive. http://aurorawiki.pentarch.org/index.php?title=Main_Page this being the dwarf fortress of space games
<Dark_Horst> sneaky archer
<Buytoast> god damn someone kick space pope's ass soon
<flutter_spin> *sigh*
<Dark_Horst> oh, burrnrrrrrrn
<TheMaster> HERESY
<flutter_spin> lol
<TheMaster> that guy needs a commisar hat
<Dark_Horst> yay for space irc
<flutter_spin> dat sneak attack
<TheMaster> solid snake would be proud
<flutter_spin> Why is it everytime I see one of those guys, I think they split their head open?
<Wrek> 05ping
<flutter_spin> Kitty came to say hi
<i> Umm
<i> Oh wow did thaat work?
<JRP2234> Wrek pong
<Spell-of-Gaming> i liek durr :3
<Dark_Horst> religious debates in a nutshell
<i> I only changed my nick to i for the pings.
<realdshannon> -.-
<flutter_spin> heh. I thought 'Twilight got a blue blanket'
<Dark_Horst> troll phlox
<[Alpha]> Storm the ship
<flutter_spin> lol
<flutter_spin> Run out of bullets? Throw the gun!
<[Alpha]> They need a Bass Cannon :P
<flutter_spin> Shouldn't they... weren't the weapons offline just a moment ago?
<Dark_Horst> flutter_spin: if you switch something off, you can usually swithc it back on again
<flutter_spin> But the enemy would have saw the weapons were offline earlier
<Dark_Horst> that
<Dark_Horst> that's why they stopped rnning and fired back again
<flutter_spin> oh snap
<flutter_spin> that green screen
<Flyboy> dafuq...
<flutter_spin> So they had war without them?
<RoboGerbil> peaceful aint it?
<[Alpha]> :S
<the_real_pony_1604> seemed pretty peaceful to me
<realdshannon> and self-genocide ftw
<pony_5642> and this is how you bring peace to the world
<flutter_spin> Just a minor detail I got confused with in the plot. Nothing to worry about.
<the_real_pony_1604> and, daawwwww sleeping filly luna
<pony_5642> awwwwwwwwwwww
<pony_5642> :3
<flutter_spin> that's a weapon?
<TheMaster> thats no weapon, its a...wait no, its a weapon
<flutter_spin> wow. That's a lot of stuff that happened last time on Enterprise
<flutter_spin> I don't remember any of it :P
<Dark92Enigma> Oh hai everypony......Star Trek enterprise, right?
<flutter_spin> He sounds familiar
<Wrek> 05he is also the prime vorta for the dominion
<flutter_spin> hahahhaa
<Wrek> 05he also acted several klingons and other aliens
<flutter_spin> That's great.
<Buytoast> it's like full house intro in space
<Dark92Enigma> LOL
<flutter_spin> I always tell my mom that Hollywood is running out of actors so they 'recycle' them in other programs
<Dark92Enigma> Buytoast Except, that this series <---- has a plot
<Buytoast> but it doesnt have bob saget
<Dark92Enigma> Buytoast which it's the main reason it was Sooooooooooo successful
<[Alpha]> :S
<flutter_spin> These guys don't like humans, I see
<Dark92Enigma> flutter_spin: They must be the bad guys.....
<Buytoast> hey i watch full house all the time shut your tongue
<Dark92Enigma> DUH!
<Buytoast> bob sagets sharp wit
<Buytoast> gary coleman's catchphrases
<Buytoast> uncle jessie's chisled jawline
<flutter_spin> I was trying to figure out a time when someone hated humans but was the good guy
<Dark92Enigma> Buytoast: Hey, it's not that i don't like it bro, i was being sarcastic
<flutter_spin> I remembered something, but no idea what
<krazy> dun dun duuuun!
<flutter_spin> cooooool
<flutter_spin> Looks like a Borg effect
<alexxm> ded
<flutter_spin> harhar
<flutter_spin> last encounter? did that go well?
<Wrek> 05yeh
<Wrek> 05humans have acted as meddlers between those two races
<Wrek> 05species*
<Dark92Enigma> From what i can tell guess Full House has a smartly-written plot and heartwarming stories filled with humour.
<Buytoast> oh shit did the smurfs and the snorks have a wild party or something?
<Dark92Enigma> I* guess
<flutter_spin> wow. So from his little chitchat... Vulcans are allies but haven't done anything. Earth is - under attack? in trouble?
<Dark92Enigma> That, or he's a Smurf in disguise
<Wrek> 05earth was attacked by a prototype probe of the weapon they are searching for
<Wrek> 05it drew a line through florida
<Wrek> 05killing 7 million
<flutter_spin> ouchies
<Dark92Enigma> I just haven't seen that much of Full House, but from what i can tell, it was a great series
<krazy> they dont seem to care very much
<flutter_spin> so these bad guys are going to send out another prototype?
<flutter_spin> or have they already done that.
<Wrek> 05the final weapon is suppsoed to be done within a motnh
<Buytoast> dey gon blow up earf
<flutter_spin> aw. So that flashback already happened
<flutter_spin> lol
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, good morning everyone

<Halei_S> Looks like Romulan Ale to me... >.>
<Dark_Horst> naw, that stuff is clearer. and more blue
<Halei_S> True true
<Buytoast> i wodner if they can honk their tubes if they hold their nose and try to exhale really hard

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so what's this on stream ?

<MadSurge> I don't follow Notch that much either...
<Jmo4267> ^
<Vivix> I unfollowed notch after a while- on twitter
<Vivix> Still have mollstam, in case of minecraft server failure
<Vivix> Child's Play is an organization that works for toys and games for children that are long term hospitalized, you know.
<MadSurge> Love Filly Luna sleeping next to Twilight :D
<Jmo4267> Mm
<Vivix> Supplying hospitals with consoles or toys
<Wrek> 05heard about their work
<MadSurge> So it's a charity drive :)
<Wrek> 05havent heard the name
<Buytoast> so wait, everyone except the doctor is asleep?
<Buytoast> lazy bastards
<Buytoast> oh my
<Jmo4267> >__>
<alexxm> do we need the naked whatever he is
<Vivix> hehe
<Jmo4267> Scary.
<Dark_Horst> good lord, i did not need to know what denobulans look like
<MadSurge> DOGGEH
<alexxm> what is he watching
<alexxm> puppy
<Wrek> 05alexxm: id liek to know too
<Wrek> 05sounds like a perfect B movie
<Buytoast> its a space ghost
<Buytoast> the spoookiest of their kind
<Tervicz> I wonder, if Star Trek is supposed to be our future, then why are there no ponies?
<Tervicz> ^^
<Vivix> We're back on earth having fun
<Jmo4267> 'fun'
<[Alpha]> Did I miss anything. I went to look up how to make my own desktop pony. It's pretty easy and all I need is photoshop
<MadSurge> Tervicz: Simply said, the producers didn't see bronies coming :D
<Wrek> 05well if you are trying to follow the series on stream
<Vivix> hehe
<Buytoast> so why is everyone asleep?
<Buytoast> space fungus?
<Vivix> Wrek, you just stream these randomly during day time? I tried to follow this series a while back but enver saw the last season
<NullRadix> [Alpha]: I doubt you need photoshop, you could probably get away with Inkscape or Paint.NET
<Buytoast> one of those magic viruses?
<Vivix> So- yeah would like to try again
<Jmo4267> Score!
<Tervicz> It's likethey said in the Chronicals of the Riddic: Who could have calculated the possibility of ponies dominating modern culture?
<Tervicz> Or something like that
<Vivix> Photoshop costs 1200 usd, or you can rent it. Otherwise, use something else
<Wrek> 05Buytoast: sometihng to do with how human brains operate. being awake would casue damage to our rbains so they are put in an artificial coma of sort
<[Alpha]> I'm very familiar with photoshop so I would prefer that one
<bob> gimp
<Dark_Horst> Buytoast: space anomalies make human brains go fryfry, so he put then in a cma
<Dark_Horst> *coma
<Wrek> 05phlox and tpol dont sleep or need rest in the same manner
<Buytoast> ah
<Jmo4267> SAI forever :>
<Vivix> SAI is great, dunno if it's good for pixel edits though?
<Wrek> 05i wouldnt say sai is good for detail pixel editing
<Jmo4267> Touche.
<Wrek> 05isnt*
<Wrek> 05wait
<Wrek> 05w/e
<Vivix> hehe
<Buytoast> i use photoshop and it works just fine
<Wrek> 05its very good for drawing
<Jmo4267> ^^
<Wrek> 05but ppixel sprite art making istn directly its nieche
<Vivix> yeah- I enjoy it, cheap too
<Wrek> 05gimp or photoshop seesm more suited
<Vivix> I would like to haev photoshop, but when I got my own bank account I stopped pirating things
<[Alpha]> Did I start something o.0?
<Jmo4267> Yarr harr fiddle do dee.
<Vivix> I don't think you started anything bad-
*Jmo4267 glomps Vivix
<Vivix> !
*Vivix awkwardly hugs
<Buytoast> is that SAI tool thing free or do you have to pay for it like i had to with photostop
<Jmo4267> :3
<Vivix> SAI costs-- 67 dollars at the current rate
<Buytoast> goddamn
<[Alpha]> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2581/
<Buytoast> i could buy food with that much
<Vivix> hehe
<Wrek> 05then again sai does give you a 30 day trial
<[Alpha]> :D
<Vivix> http://www.systemax.jp/en/sai/ pretty cool
<[Alpha]> I'm just gonna use my ipad to make pixel art
<bob> you can use graphics gale
<Jmo4267> lolipad
<bob> its for pixel art and pixel animations
<Vivix> I tried Corel Painter first- but I bought sai instead, since I liked it more-
<Buytoast> bah, i'll just stick with paper drawn scan traces
<Jmo4267> openCanvas is decent from what I've seen.
<Dark_Horst> interesting species, those denobulans
<Vivix> Oh! I had forgotten about that program-
<Jmo4267> :P
<[Alpha]> Great I learned how to draw with my finger. Now I must learn to draw with a mouse. 6_9
<Vivix> Hehe- pixel isn't too bad with mouse, but anythign else is a hassle in my opinion-
<Jmo4267> ^
<Vivix> Hey, does anyone here own a Intuos tablet?
<Wrek> 05yeah intous 4
<Buytoast> i got a wamboo bamboo tablet
<Vivix> I'm considering buying one- and was wondering if it was- rougher? Like the pen had more friction, like paper?
<Jmo4267> lolwamboo
<alexxm> bad cgi
<[Alpha]> It was a pain learning to draw with my finger because of the sensor in an\ ipad
<Vivix> My current tablet is very much like drawing with a felt pen or something- very slick
<Wrek> 05Vivix:thats what the different tips are for
<MadSurge> INSEEEECTS
<Vivix> Ah, great!
<Wrek> 05the one i ues is a bit softer to casue firction
<Vivix> That sounds great- 'cause yeah the whole slickness has made me horrible at straight and smooth lines
<[Alpha]> Weevel would be proud of that bug
<Vivix> It costs a fair amount, but I'm sure it'll be worht it if I save up
<Jmo4267> That indeed it does.
<[Alpha]> grrr I'll kill this program with a cactus
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Vivix> What're you doing?
<[Alpha]> Forget it I'm going to use photoshop. For the record I know how to use in both windows and mac
<Vivix> You were trying SAI?
<[Alpha]> Forget it I got it
<Vivix> Okay, good good
<Dark_Horst> she's a hallucination. wnna bet?
<[Alpha]> Darn I can only use the touchscreen on Microsoft paint
<Eli> Dark_Horst: yeah, she's an hallucination. she doesn't touch anything
<Dark_Horst> she also doesnt seem to know any more than he does
<Vivix> I think I remember this episode
<MadSurge> I think they did something similar with Voyager
<MadSurge> Except it was the ex-Borg chick
<Dark_Horst> yeah, seven of nine had to steer the ship through a nebula on her own
<MadSurge> Not even the doctor hologram could help her
<Eli> helping illusions are a popular thing... they apear in a lot of series
<Eli> i remember one in Bones
<Dark_Horst> i doubt this illusion is helpful
<Eli> it's calming to know you're not alone
<Dark_Horst> or is it
<Eli> or to think for that matter
*Saturn 08,01feels happy and gay
<Saturn> 08,01i just had a shower

<RainBowJack> bye bye everypony
<Vivix> Byee
<Ponies47> DINNER
<Ponies47> LAter RainBowJack
<Jmo4267> >12:07AM
<Saturn> 08,01wrek: fulommeh only has the 10 - 15 fips
<Scootaloo_> dinner its 12 o clock
<MegaMoonShine> Hi everypony :)
<Jmo4267> Hey MegaMoonShine
<Jmo4267> :>
<alexxm> how you doing MegaMoonShine
<Wrek> 05strange it should be higher
<[Alpha]> I sense the ban hammer is coming
<MegaMoonShine> Good alexxm thanks :$
<Scootaloo_> the site is back up
<Sundaysmile> What's on the box?
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> I will never hate what you stream anymore. I learned my ****ing lesson
<Sundaysmile> ah Star Trek
<Vivix> It's abo respecting the stream, not blindly liking it. Which is easy to do- I think
<Jmo4267> ^
<MegaMoonShine> ^^
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> I RESPECT THE STREAM
<Wrek> 05no allcaps
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Sorry
<Saturn> 08,01oh GreeHetBronyInDuitsl, you just can't win...
<Vivix> Sometimes, every step you take is into a rake
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> I know
<Jmo4267> I like rakes.
<Dark_Horst> something tells me this will keep going for a while
<Saturn> 08,01we still <3 you GreeHetBronyInDuitsl
<Sundaysmile> tribbles?
<Saturn> 08,01well, wrek might now
<Saturn> 08,01*not
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Cool
<Vivix> Eew
<Dark_Horst> space plant jizz
<Wrek> 05Saturn: i dont worke like that
<[Alpha]> Or sometimes you take a step into a rake but catch the rake before it hit you in the face
<Wrek> 05takes moer to make me dislike someone
<Vivix> Sometimes I like to read Wrek's chat in a Skyrim voice
<Wrek> 05im more indifferent
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> I'm going to start a rampage!
<Jmo4267> Lol Vivix
<Sundaysmile> stuttering for anyone?
<Vivix> That's a good mod attitude, though. Some --sites have really angry mods that start more flames than they put out
<MegaMoonShine> For me it is
<Dark_Horst> *couch*4chan*couch*
<Vivix> it is for me too- but I'm on a 0.6mbps line
<Jmo4267> I know that feeling Vivix.
<[Alpha]> I'm just random but mostly quiet
<Vivix> I tend to write a lot-
<Jmo4267> I like to read alot.
<Vivix> When I first came here I got auto kicked a lot from my "hit enter all the time" steam habbit
<alexxm> why do they keep bringing up movie night
<Sundaysmile> and besides, movie night is friday night
<[Alpha]> grrr the only issu I have in drawing is body structures
<[Alpha]> issue
<Vivix> Do you use circles and boxes?
<Vivix> that helped me a loot in body drawing
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> For once and for all,i wanted dutch movies at friday movie night. Just saying
<Vivix> I bet his attitude has somethign to with the egg
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> I'm not angry
<Dark_Horst> why dutch?
<[Alpha]> no i try to freestyle
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> For a good reason
<Vivix> if you try just adding a few circles, you might find it easier to rotate the bodies and pose it the way you want, depending on your style
<Dark_Horst> care to state said reason?
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Reason:None
<Sundaysmile> he killed the ship..
<Vivix> I still stick by that Titanic should be a nickname for bad ships or ships that end poorly.
<[Alpha]> That's what i did at the start but I disliked it after a while so I try just drawing it all without outlines
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> I have a reason why i want 1 dutch movie on friday movie night:Cause i like Dutch/French movies
<Vivix> Yeah- in art you shouhld do what you enjoy the most, what works for you
<Sundaysmile> he's INFECTED!
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Hope you are gonna make a new kind of movie night
<Vivix> He's becoming greener and greener
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Who me?
<Vivix> no the captain in the stream
<Dark_Horst> i'll make a guess: the stuff the egg sprayed on him is tapping into his brain and makes him develope protector-instincts
<Striker> hello?
<Jmo4267> Hello Striker
<Vivix> Guys, is there a place to see or someone to ask what movies are on the trilogy week thingy?
<MegaMoonShine> Hello Striker :)
<[Alpha]> I guess I'll have to observe body structures more. i think the reason I can draw faces better than bodies is mainly because It's what I observe the most or enjoy the most drawing
<Vivix> Dark_Horst: that's what I'm thinking too
<Sundaysmile> crispy critter
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> The gates of hell Trilogy
<Jmo4267> Vivix: The steam group usually posts what is going to be played during the week.
*Striker ate a random object
<Vivix> [Alpha]: I prefer drawing faces too- so constructing the bodies help me sketch faster
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Vivix
<Vivix> Jmo4267: thanks- I'll have to keep an eye on that
<Jmo4267> No worries :)
<MadSurge> Vivix: this week it's Pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones
<pony_7007> respect has been gained for captein archer
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Vivix!
<[Alpha]> I always draw the face first but when I finish the face ....let's just say I don't look forward to the next part
*Striker is confused
<Sundaysmile> doesn't he believe in showers?
<Vivix> Ah, yes. I was here last ngiht but fell asleep before Indiana Jones
<Vivix> Yes, GreeHetBronyInDuitsl ?
<pony_7007> captain*
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Next week on stream should be the gates of hell trilogy
<Vivix> Mm- haven't heard of that
<MadSurge> Gates of hell?
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Yes
*Striker pooped rainbows
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> I actually ment City of the living Dead
<MadSurge> Ooooh
<Vivix> When I draw faces I usually use a blue and red sketching--pencil, so fun. I drew a Goatalope, I have to finish a drawing of her one day-
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> The movie from 1980,you know?
<Vivix> Mm.. I haven't heard of it- I don't watch all that many movies
*Striker made popcorn
<Striker> :P
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Because of the italian gore or the Director (Lucio Fulci)
<Vivix> There's only two movies in the space oddyssey thing, right?
<Quick_Thinker> hey everypony more bronys found on COD one named equestrian pony and ht eother called xsuperDerpy
<MadSurge> Lucio Fulci <3
<MadSurge> Quick_Thinker: :D
<Quick_Thinker> so far i also found a Twililicious
*Striker ate another random object
<Quick_Thinker> stop eating random objects you could accidently eat a grenade :c
<Vivix> Or a bug..
<Vivix> I almost accidentally ate a snail the other day-
<Quick_Thinker> or could some pony swag :C
<Striker> My dad`s cooking taste worst
<BaconMane|Subway> 0,5You almost ate snails?
<Vivix> My cat had one on him, and it came on my hand and I wiped my mouth. I almost threw up
<BaconMane|Subway> 0,5ew
<Jmo4267> How do you accidently eat a snail
<Vivix> it was on my haand and I didn't see it
<Jmo4267> >__>
<Vivix> it was..awful
<Jmo4267> There is a purpose for your eyes :P
*Striker barfed on Vivix
<Sundaysmile> and then they made out
<Vivix> it was one of those tiny ones-
<Vivix> hehehe
<BaconMane> 0,5Snails is worst pony
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Let's make a Short quiz bronies!
<MadSurge> Vivix: you should still try escargot :D
<Vivix> Hehe, one day I will- I think
*Striker pooped out a rainbow
<Vivix> They're not raw, right?
<MadSurge> Vivix: of course not! :D
*Vivix dries face on Striker
<Vivix> hehehe
<Vivix> Well- it sounds like it might be delicious, like mushrooms
<Vivix> look terrible, taste awesome
<Sundaysmile> video paused?
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Just kidding.
<MadSurge> Vivix: they kinda taste like seafood, like clams and the like
<Vivix> Hm.. sounds alright
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> We call this Hell of the living Dead reference gone wrong :D
<Vivix> hehe
<Sundaysmile> skipping much for anyone?
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> I ment Night of the Zombies (Italy 1980)
<Vivix> Skipping a bit here
*Striker puts on stealth cloak
<MadSurge> Italian horror movies are either terrifying or hilariously bad :D
<Spell> Good afternoon! My name is Spell Burst!
<Vivix> Hello!
<Spell> That was almost ripped from TS xD
<Buytoast> kill the captain
*Striker pants Spell
<Buytoast> he's gone mad with power
<Sundaysmile> of course he's gone mad with power
<Sundaysmile> ever tried not going mad with power?
<Vivix> It sounds like- he's doing the right thing, but is going insane with that green goop
<NullRadix> Doesn't work, no one listens to you
<P4ngya> he's gone made with bug juice
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> French horror movies will be better or French dubs of italian horror movies are better
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Vivix> Simpsons the movie
<Vivix> Al..what's his name? The actor.
*Striker THE CAKE IS A LIE!!
<Striker> MOO
<Buytoast> and that guy is milking it for all the power he can gain from him
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> What do y'all think about what i said? :)
<Buytoast> these people are dicks
<Vivix> I always said the cake was not a lie- we see it at the end ;__;
<P4ngya> GreeHetBronyInDuitsl: why are yo utalking about french horror movies? 0.o
<Sundaysmile> Whenever I watch this show I keep expecting Al to appear like Q and mention something about ziggy
<Tovler> I never thought I'd see the day when I'd get bored of lightning
*Striker is eating toast
<Jmo4267> Face the truth Vivix.
<Vivix> I don't want to!
<Vivix> The lie is comfort!
<alexxm> thats not good enough
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> I ment french dubs of Italian horror movies!
<Jmo4267> The lie is comfort that will fade eventually.
<Jmo4267> FACE THE TRUTH.
<Vivix> But, it will feel good for a whiiile!
<Sundaysmile> Jmo4267 please lie down and assume the party submission position
*Striker set his phasers to hug
<Jmo4267> ..Wait what?
<Sundaysmile> an armed party escort team will be with you shortly
<Vivix> Now I'm curiouis as to what position that would be
<Jmo4267> How'd I get selected for this siitatuion?
<Jmo4267> situation^
*Striker assumes the party submission position
<Wrek> 05buck a tree in the banana position
<Jmo4267> Oh I see now.
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Trivia:Did you know Michele Soavi made only 3 Movies?
<Sundaysmile> killed the stream Wrek?
*Striker turned on stealth mode
<Jmo4267> Stream is still running fine.
<Vivix> still on here too
<Sundaysmile> it just shut down for me...
<Wrek> 05hit play
<Wrek> 05its a known issue with limeV
<[Alpha]> But I like bananas they are full of potassium
<Vivix> Ahh
<Sundaysmile> ah
<fluffle_puff> Space balls
*Vivix huge 60s cartoon wizard voice "Potassium Benzoate!"
<Striker> Dem my balls
<fluffle_puff> you got some nasty ball then
<fluffle_puff> balls
<Sundaysmile> talking to balls
<Striker> HE FORGOT TO SET HIS PHASER TO HUG!!:o
<Vivix> Whenever I see bananas mentioned in a Celestia fic I get worried, even if I've never seen a trollestia comic
<Vivix> or..whatever that is from
<Jmo4267> Do you like bananas?
<Wrek> 05i wonder if you could teleport antimatter
<Vivix> IMPOSSIBLE QUESTION
<Jmo4267> :>
<Vivix> hehe
<Wrek> 05seeing as the science behidn it is that it deconstructs your molecuels and the rebuilds them somewhere else
<Sundaysmile> well teleporters teleport matter
<alexxm> boom
<[Alpha]> I saw the video so yeah I get the joke. Also if you have seen two best sisters play portal two he is eating a banana
<Sundaysmile> anti matter is like the opposite no?
<Wrek> 05which is why i ask
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> I always want to get Arrow video releases of movies (Except House by the Cemetery and Gates of Hell (1980))
<Striker> that pulse grenade wasn`t set to hug!:O
<Vivix> Yeah, I've gotten the joke by proxy, but I always get worried that it'll turn out tob e a trollfic
<[Alpha]> What is trollfic?
<Jmo4267> >_>
<Vivix> Like a joke..
<Vivix> the whole story is just a joke
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> List of arrow video Blu-rays i want: 1.Unsane 2.Creepers (Phenomena) 3.Inferno (1980) 4.Battle Royale
<Striker> ?me has a troll face
*Striker has a trollface
<Striker> better
<fluffle_puff> He is feeling his balls
<Sundaysmile> Space Mutiny!
<Sundaysmile> They need more guardrails!
<Striker> THAT PHASER WASNT SET TO HUG!:o
<[Alpha]> That sounds annoiying
<[Alpha]> annoying
<Striker> Set that phaser hug boy
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> And last but not least: 5.Cat o' 9 tails 6. Dawn of the Dead (1978) 7.Day of the Dead (1985)
<Vivix> A phaser set to hug could potentially be used for self stimulation of an erotic nature.
<Vivix> or- a platonic nature
<Vivix> ie. "I want a hug."
*Striker licks Vivix
<Vivix> !
<[Alpha]> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2163/
<[Alpha]> :3

*Striker sticks head out of bush
<Serenity> Midnight BST
<CriticKitten> Yeah, Steam just claimed the movies were starting. XD
<Vivix|Awai> But I don't know the BST timezone ;__; PST?
<AttacktheAndalite> Huh? I am confused...
<Flyboy> Jmo4267: we heard you liek midnight, so we put midnight in your midnight
<Serenity> BST = British Summer time
<Jmo4267> That's only 3 cycles, not deep enough. Baaad.
<Vivix|Awai> Oh, okay, that then its 1 am here
<Serenity> Basically 90% of europe is 1 hour ahead of BST
<AttacktheAndalite> Hai Meanwhile
<Vivix|Awai> yeah-
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<AttacktheAndalite> *scratches her head in confusion* What is everyone talkinga bout?
*Serenity drags Meanwhile into the chat
<Vivix|Awai> I'm used to british time being called GMT 0
<Serenity> Vivix|Awai: It's summer, so it's BST :P
<Serenity> Hence being called British SUMMER time
<Jmo4267> GMT8+ represent.
*Striker poops out Serenity
*Serenity stabs Striker
<Vivix|Awai> oh yeah, but some measure it as GMT 0 in winter and GMT 1 in summer, or GMT 0 Summertime
*Striker respawn
<Serenity> And that's how you can't have children with a banana
<Vivix|Awai> as we are GMT 1 normally GMT 2 in summer or GMT 1 sumemrtime
<Meanwhile> Well, chat's confusing.
<CriticKitten> "Nearly two years after the game's release, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game is getting new downloadable content, which will add online multiplayer to the XBLA version of the game." :o
<Vivix|Awai> Steam said movies are starting- so- I got confused and asked about time-
<Serenity> CriticKitten: Blame EA
<AttacktheAndalite> I miss Harry Potter already :l
<fluffle_puff> Dat body
<CriticKitten> And the DLC has Wallace as a playable character? Brb, buying an Xbox.

<Serenity> Pay 99 dollars then?
<Jmo4267> ^Homerun.
<Serenity> And then pay the one like 10 years later or something
<Vivix|Awai> You checked ebay and all that, right? and you want a mint copy?
<AttacktheAndalite> Vivix|Awai: I only have the first game now. I don't play it anymore because I've beaten it 3 times already. I need to get the second and third
<Vivix|Awai> Ah yeah
<AttacktheAndalite> Vivix|Awai: Yep, checked ebay. And for some reason when I try to order something online, it won't accept my card because of the security code on the back because it's VERY hard to tell what the first two numbers are
<Vivix|Awai> Ahh- maybe you should get a new one- I need to get a new one
<Serenity> AttacktheAndalite: Send me your credit card and I'll help you :3
<fluffle_puff> About to go all pirate on them
<Jmo4267> Serenity is legit.
<AttacktheAndalite> Vivix|Awai: If I could get a collector's edition I'd be happier but for now I just want the third...
<AttacktheAndalite> Serenity: Lolol I'm alll the way in the US, and I don't think that's a good idea to send you my card info XD
<Vivix|Awai> you could have a friend order it for you? And pay them in cash?
<Meanwhile> Suddenly shower scene.

<DerpStar> Trellium Saturn
<Spectrum_Rush> Saturn: spce crack apparently
<Daygon> ok

<Vivix|Awai> I actually lost my card 2 months ago, inadvertedly saved up 1500 dollars and spent it all on music gear
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: shouldnt she be, like, dead?
<Daygon> woona is sleeping
<AttacktheAndalite> Vivix|Awai: Dang. Did you get a new one?
<Vivix|Awai> Loosing card = great way to save
<MadSurge> Daygon: Star Trek Enterprise
<DerpStar> Vivix|Awai: better then spending on cons ;)
<Jmo4267> REHEARSE. >__>
<Vivix|Awai> Not yet, but I got acces to my accoun via my mothers account- so I'm good yet

*Jmo4267 ditches muffs at Vivix|Awai
*Vivix|Awai stomps big muff pedal
<AttacktheAndalite> .....what?
<Daygon> How long is this?
<Dark_Horst> 40 minutes per episode
<Vivix|Awai> bigmuff is a fuzz/dist pedal, sounds dirtier than what it is
<Obsidian> 44 mins I think.
<Daygon> how many minutes passed by?
<Obsidian> No idea
<DerpStar> 42 minutes according to itunes
<Daygon> But like an estimate
<MegaMoonShine> Hi again :)
<DerpStar> They should set phaser to hug
<Jmo4267> Hai MegaMoonShine
<MegaMoonShine> More Trek?
<DerpStar> Hai MegaMoonShine
<Jmo4267> Moar Trek
<AttacktheAndalite> Hello MegaMoonShine, how are you?

<Obsidian> Hello Meanwhile
<Serenity> It's 45 minutes
<Zanon> treeeeek
<Obsidian> Uh sorry MegaMoonShine
<MegaMoonShine> I'm fine, AttacktheAndalite thanks
<Dark_Horst> oooohboy.... they're gonna be evil
<DerpStar> Space Piracy
<Meanwhile> Daaaaamn.
<Serenity> Because in my country, we have 5 minute advert breaks about 20 minutes in, then we do the last 25 minutes and have a 10 minute advert break
<DerpStar> Renegade Archer
<Meanwhile> If the Prime Directive existed he'd be in so much shit...
<Buytoast> and thus, earth became bullies of teh galaxy
<Serenity> Buytoast: >:3
<Lil_B> Saturn , didn't you study Adio Engineering?
<AttacktheAndalite> I think I'm going to start getting into Star Wars. Good/bad idea, and any recommendations?
*DerpStar shines light in Alien's face
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: if you like scifi, why not? :)
<shana> AttacktheAndalite: only watch episode 4-6 :D
<DerpStar> Star Wars < Star Trek
<Wrek> 05i find both enjoyable
<Jmo4267> ^
<DerpStar> Indeed
<Spectrum_Rush> ^^
<Serenity> SO MANY SCI FI's that begin with "star"
<DerpStar> But still I enjoy trek more
<Jmo4267> STAR GATE
<Jmo4267> STAR WARS
<Jmo4267> STAR TREK
<Jmo4267> Star muffins.
<fluffle_puff> http://th04.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2011/295/c/7/little_pip_by_kooner01-d4dl915.png
<Dark_Horst> also, star wars isnt even remotely similar to star trek. just saying
<Wrek> 05STAR SHIP TROOPERS
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<Jmo4267> Oh how could I forget that one
<Serenity> Battlestar galatica
<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: Well I haven't been much into sci-fi a lot but since Star Wars seems to come on at EVERY MINOR OCCASION on Spike TV, it's grown on me.
<NullRadix> Star fox
<Meanwhile> Wrek: You mean Lagship Troopers.
<Serenity> Doesn't start with star, but it has star in it
<Dark_Horst> GALAXY QUEST!
<MegaMoonShine> ^
<Serenity> ^ no
<DerpStar> Yes
<Dark_Horst> yes
<Wrek> 05Meanwhile: i dont get the lag
<Daygon> I really dont get whats happening
<[Alpha]> :D
<Serenity> Doesn't start with star
<Wrek> 05pelase explain
<Saturn> 08,01i love pixelwrek's tail
<Lil_B> isn't there a Movie that has both Star Wars and Star Trek Parodys in it?
<Dark_Horst> scre stars
<Meanwhile> Wrek: When we showed it here it lagged for like, 3/4 of the movie.
<MegaMoonShine> Maybe so, but it is still a damn good filn
<Lil_B> Saturn , didn't you study Adio Engineering?
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: you mean Star Expendable Troopers
<Wrek> 05heh
<Daygon> Did you guys play Space Balls yet?
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: :D but do try Star Trek, it can't be so bad right?
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: i know about it; i do it as a hobby
<Sundaysmile> she's emotional?
<DerpStar> Vulcan emotions>
<Serenity> Saturn: What DON'T you do as a hobby?
<Dark_Horst> trellium is getting to her
<Saturn> 08,01Serenity: drawing
<MadSurge> Daygon: in Movie Nights, yes
<Saturn> 08,01i can't draw
<Lil_B> Saturn oh, I was going to buy some Studio Headphones and I search for some advice :)
<Daygon> I see
<Serenity> Yeah, but that takes alien knowledge
<Serenity> And crayons
<DerpStar> She broke his iPad
<Striker> GGG
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: sure, what are ryou looking at?
<[Alpha]> :D
<Daygon> OKIE DOKIE LOKI
<Spectrum_Rush> this is wy T'pol is going crazy http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Trellium
<Dark_Horst> fuck ipads, everything on that ship runs on linux
<MadSurge> DerpStar: Ikr :(
<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: I might...I've never been much for Star Trek, admittedly. My parents and sister like it, though. I also enjoy the classic Batman.
<Serenity> Now now Spectrum_Rush
<Zanon> what its not running on windows Me?
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: you mean the campy one? :D
<Lil_B> Saturn just Studio Headphones for making music at home (an accasionly listeing to music or movies with it)
<Alchemist> AttacktheAndalite: you mean the series with adam west or the movies by tim burton?
<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: Dear God, you're calling it campy too?? :D My sister called it that last night?
<Spectrum_Rush> Serenity: wha, it's relevant to wats streaming
<AttacktheAndalite> Alchemist: The series with Adam West and Burt Ward as Dick
*Striker backs up slowly
<Striker> moo
<AttacktheAndalite> Alchemist: I mean Robin, Boy Blunder :x
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: I said campy, but it's still very enjoyable :D
<DerpStar> lol
<[Alpha]> FUN FACT: Android runs on Lunix
<Serenity> I've always wondered, why isn't the trouch screen on the 3DS not 3d?
<Lil_B> Saturn I narrowed it down to 3 models based on reccomendations and the little eadphones FAQ I read
<Vivix|Awai> I was told never to get headphones for mixing
<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: I rather enjoy it now. A few years ago my dad was watching it on TV and I was all "Wow this looks sooo boring." Now I watch it every time I visit my parents
<Lil_B> Serenity I thought it is the touchscreen that is the 3D screen -.-
<Meanwhile> Her logic was seriously comprised if she thought getting high off poison rock was a good idea.
<MegaMoonShine> That would make it even more complicated, Serenity
<Serenity> Lil_B: Nah, it's the topscreen
<Meanwhile> comprimised*
<Pikachu> hi
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile, well who doesn't like getting high off of poison space rocks? /sarcasm
<Lil_B> Vivix|Awai why?
<flutter_spin> woot! my fanfic finally got approved like an hour ago
<Meanwhile> AttacktheAndalite: Klingons.
<Serenity> Complicated? I ripped out a touch screen from an old DS, and it looks just like what the top screen looks like ',..,'
<MegaMoonShine> hi Pikachu :)
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: :D silly is fun, and it doesn't ruin "serious" Batman for me
<Pikachu> :)
<Vivix|Awai> They said the bass frequencies weren't getting enough space or something- I dunno, they just told me to get monitors instead
<DerpStar> Well I'm more comfortable with moon rocks personally
<flutter_spin> lol. Still going on that same dvd I see, Wrek
<Spectrum_Rush> dat Hyppocratic oath
<Wrek> 05grats flutter_spin!
<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: I admit, a lot of stuff I thought was stupid back when I was a kid I now enjoy, all thanks to bronystate. And that is 100% no sarcasm. Oh the things you think when you're younger.
<fluffle_puff> Shouldn't she already be able to access emotions (I thought Volcans just suppressed their emotions and that they actually have stronger emotions than humans)
<NullRadix> I'm assuming the touchscreen isn't 3D as a cost-benefit thing
<Buytoast> aliens can't be human
<Buytoast> what are you talking about
<Meanwhile> fluffle_puff: She's been getting high on toxic material.
<flutter_spin> I'm actually quite surprised my first comment was "it is over-descriptive"
<Buytoast> das dum
<Sundaysmile> cardassians?
<Buytoast> das relly relly dum
<flutter_spin> I must be doing a good job.
<NullRadix> sure, they could hack together another 3D screen and make it work with touch, but you don't gain much from it
<String_Shredder> BUytoast: Tell that to Americans
<Dark_Horst> damn, they evil
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: aye. Although I did have an eye for good shows back then too, I didn't realize it yet :D
<Spectrum_Rush> desperate more like it
<DerpStar> Are his phasers set to hug?
<Wrek> 05Sundaysmile: i thoguth that first too, but no
<Shizuka> 13http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/674239main_PIA16001-full_full.jpg
<fluffle_puff> Yes, but the way she was talking made it sound as if she never had them to begin with
<[Alpha]> So stephen king is known to write evry detail
<Striker> moo
<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: I never liked Power Rangers when I was a kid, probably because my brother would ALWAYS watch that when he beat me to the TV on Saturday mornings and he had a lot of Power Rangers action figures. It annoyed me.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: aren't you happy that they managed to land it? :)
<fluffle_puff> I hope they find Luna up there
<Meanwhile> Power Rangers are best pony.
<DerpStar> My little brother watched power rangers but I had G1 ponies ^^
*Striker ...
<Lil_B> yeah right... the Mars landing happened XD I forgot to check this out XD
<MegaMoonShine> That's cool Shizuka :$
<Buytoast> ivan ooze was the greatest being ever
*AttacktheAndalite throws a pillow at Meanwhile "hahahaha no"
<Buytoast> that bastard had some style
*Meanwhile is pillowed.
<Meanwhile> But I like Power Rangers. :c
*Saturn 08,01nuzzles Wrek
*Wrek nuzzles back
<Jmo4267> GOGO MIGHTY MORPHIN' RANGERS
<Striker> umm..
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: luckily I am the elder brother, and we both always enjoyed cartoon :D
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: favorite series?
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Of course you do.
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: Mighty Morphin'. Ofc.
<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: Sweet.
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: good on ya man
<AttacktheAndalite> I have come to a realization about the shows I thought were stupid when I was a kid :3
<Striker> HIS PHASER ISNT SET TO HUG!!
<DerpStar> IKR Striker
<Vivix|Awai> I'm a guy, and apparently for my first christmas my grandma gave me a MLP doll, that would be 1989 I think
<Striker> LOL
<AttacktheAndalite> Vivix|Awai: Early brony!
<Alchemist> it was a sign :D
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: and we almost always agreed on what was good and what was crap :D ah, the times when CN was still good
<Vivix|Awai> hehe yeaah
<Vivix|Awai> I still have it, under my screen
<MegaMoonShine> Always destined to be one of us!
<Lil_B> Vivix|Awai you were ment to be and your grandmother knew!
<fluffle_puff> It was set to bear hug
<DerpStar> My little Brother would watch MLP with me G1
<Wrek> 05fun thing Vivix|Awai
<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: I miss old CN. Courage was my favorite
<Vivix|Awai> Hehe, it was fun to refind it when we moved, yeah
<Alchemist> and dexter's lab and powerpuff girls
<Vivix|Awai> Oh I loved those shows-
<MegaMoonShine> Me too
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: I liked all old Cartoon Cartoon series
<DerpStar> Pinky and the Brain
<AttacktheAndalite> Favorite episode of Courage was the one with King Ramsey.
<Wrek> 05i actualyl recall playign with the old MLP toys that used to be at my grandmas house
<Wrek> 05she used to have a daycare
<Vivix|Awai> *rehearsing, plays LOW. About 1 note every 3 seconds*
<Vivix|Awai> Ah, that's cool
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: The man in gauze! The man in gauze!
<Spectrum_Rush> strange how the world works sometimes , eh Wrek
<Vivix|Awai> I used to play with barbie dolls under my grandmas table
<Jmo4267> >_>

<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: Raaaamseeeeeeeyyy~
<Saturn> 08,01i remember seeing mlp toys when i was young, and i wanted one because they were really cute
<flutter_spin> I used to hit two rocks together and say "now kiss"
<Saturn> 08,01must have been a G1
<AttacktheAndalite> I never played with MLP toys when I was younger.
<AttacktheAndalite> Never even watched the show. Too busy watching Digimon
<Saturn> 08,01and i wanted to brushie brushie...
<[Alpha]> Wrek that would make you about 9 years oldright?
<MadSurge> I recall watching some G1 when I was a kid and thinking "huh, this ain't half bad" :D
<Meanwhile> Inb4 those people don't get home.
<Wrek> 05msut have been longer than that
<Wrek> 05fuc ki cant recall off hand when she died... but it was 2 or 3 years before that
<AttacktheAndalite> I bet some of these brony haters played with MLP toys when they were kids
<Gold_Demona> I arrive just in time to see the end credits, lol. XD
<flutter_spin> Must. Resist. Enterprise and work on story
<Saturn> 08,01G1 cartoons are nothing special, but they're not bad at all
<MegaMoonShine> Hello Gold_Demona :)

<fluffle_puff> We need some sea ponies
<Gold_Demona> I'm doing alright. Waiting for dinner to finish cooking. :3
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate.

<MegaMoonShine> Hi FillyFlam :)
<AttacktheAndalite> Hello, FillyFlam

<Sweetie_Belle> hi
<flutter_spin> Now I must see 1st episode
<DerpStar> Sigh DoublePint wants to play on PC, cya everypony
<AttacktheAndalite> I went to Five Guys a few months ago and I noticed that one of the cashier guys had a Deathly Hallows tattoo on his left wrist. We high-fived
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: indeed
*Saturn 08,01lies on wrek
<fluffle_puff> They cut America's wang
*Wrek holds his arm around Saturn. time to stop RPing
<Jmo4267> denied.
<Saturn> 08,01fluffle_puff: they devolved florida?
<Sundaysmile> the A team?
<AttacktheAndalite> Now I want a deathly hallows tattoo...but I don't like needles.
<Meanwhile> Sundaysmile: the eighteen.
<alexxm> for the a team
<Sundaysmile> lol
<FillyFlam> Oh, this -is- Star Trek.
<MegaMoonShine> A team? Where?
<Vivix|Awai> my sister got a tattoo on her ribs and abdomen, we had to hold her down so he could finish the colouring
<Saturn> 08,01# i will touch this guy #
<Sundaysmile> FOR MR T!!!!!
<Vivix|Awai> she was like "HOLD ME DOWN!"
<Saturn> 08,01hahaha
<Jmo4267> LOL
<MegaMoonShine> Why the ribs?
<Vivix|Awai> big tattoo
<Saturn> 08,01what did she get tattooed?
<Gold_Demona> I love this song, but it seems weird not having an orchestrated piece for a Star Trek intro. :P
<Vivix|Awai> she has many on her arms and upper chest too
<Vivix|Awai> a local performer that has inspired her a lot
*Saturn 08,01is considering getting the BUCK logo tattooed on him bum
<Vivix|Awai> just colours and a silhouette
<Wrek> 05im considerign getting a tatoo of the hollowed otu moon logo aswell as some kind of adaption of twi's cutie mark
<Wrek> 05jsut played with the thought though
<Daygon> is this a new episode?
<Daygon> it is
<[Alpha]> Saturn are you serious or drunk again?
<Saturn> 08,01[Alpha]: i'm never drunk! i don't drink!
<Jmo4267> 2:41AM. Damn time flew.
<Saturn> 08,01well, i do
<Saturn> 08,01but not often
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not serious, thoguh
<Wrek> 05seth macfarlane worked on this
<AttacktheAndalite> I want my first tattoo to be pony-related but I can't decide. My second one HP related
<Vivix|Awai> good on ya, saturn
<Wrek> 05bet you didnt know that
<[Alpha]> Well then you just contradicted yourself there
<Serenity> I'm probably going to get tatto of the triforce on my hand :3
<Braviary> Hello, what is on right now?
<MegaMoonShine> Hello Braviary, we're watching Star Trek :)
<Lil_B> can I Link to a Song on Dropbox I'm working on to get some opinions?
<Braviary> With one, MegaMoonShine?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm actually seriously considering getting a tattoo of Britannia somewhere
<Serenity> :3
<[Alpha]> I would like a tattoo but it goes against my moral code
<Lil_B> ^
<Braviary> *Which one?
<Wrek> 05Saturn if it wont look good, dont do it
<Wrek> 05no matter how nice it would be
<MegaMoonShine> Not sure
<MegaMoonShine> The Next Generation, I think
<Wrek> 05and i fail to see a moral dilemma behind tattoos
<Wrek> 05MegaMoonShine: no its just enterprise
<Serenity> I would just totally be more badass than I am now, in some epic BAETUHL and just having the triforce on my hand :3
<Wrek> 05not TNG
<[Alpha]> Not when you are me
<Sundaysmile> she's becoming a Romulan!
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: aye; i'm still trying to work out whether i like the idea
<MegaMoonShine> I see :$
<Saturn> 08,01and whether it will look good
<Buytoast> as long as you don't get a tatto on your hand, face or forearm you're good
<AttacktheAndalite> I want a Pinkie tattoo but I don't think the color would show up too well on my skin. The DH one will just be all black
<Dark_Horst> awwww, she sad
<Saturn> 08,01maybe pinkie pie's cutie mark...
<Buytoast> or anywhere that'd be seen by a job interviewr
<Sundaysmile> better than she mad
<Saturn> 08,01hmm... i wonder if one can have one's penis tattooed...
<Lil_B> oh, and I may have one last question about BronyCon for you :3
<Vivix|Awai> yes you can
<Serenity> Saturn: Riiiight
<Vivix|Awai> have you never seen the dragon penis Saturn?
<[Alpha]> :O
<Sundaysmile> you can Staurn
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn, let's not wonder.
<Buytoast> you can have your dick inked
<Sundaysmile> but it's not recommended
<Buytoast> it's painful
<killerpony7733> Saturn: I believe it's possible but it hurts
<FillyFlam> Saturn: As a matter of fact you can.
<Buytoast> but possible
<Vivix|Awai> Dragon penis is some guy who tattoed his dick to look like a dragon head, I think
<Serenity> Tattooing is painful full stop
<[Alpha]> :S
<Saturn> 08,01just a thought... i can't think of any tattoo that'd look good there
<Vivix|Awai> excuse the language
<Meanwhile> I bet it burns when he pees.
<Daygon> EW
<Buytoast> an elephant trunk
<Sundaysmile> not because of the pain, but because of the skin stretching, it disfigures the tattoo
<[Alpha]> :[
<Buytoast> and your inner thighs can be the ears
<Boodfire> a submarine
<Saturn> 08,01and it'd mean i'd have to wave my genitals about in public for people to see
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Wait a second, is that startrek....BTW, Hi everypony :)
<Serenity> Saturn: Seems normal
<Vivix|Awai> yeah, it's--a pretty bad idea, EXPENSIVE and bad
<[Alpha]> :D
<MegaMoonShine> Hi Kawaii_icybeauti :)
<Buytoast> you can open your basement up as a circus and invite all to see the elephant balance a beach ball
<Saturn> 08,01and though i've not got any qualms about doing that myself, i doubt the police would agree
<AttacktheAndalite> Hai Kawaii_icybeauti *huggles*
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Heya MegaMoonShine
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Hi AttacktheAndalite
<Zanon> Omg this is gold
<Sundaysmile> facial tattoos are also a no no, since as you age, the tattoo's disfigure because of the skin changes
<Lil_B> oh, Saturn , and I may have one last question about BronyCon for you :3 where will you be, I want to make sure we meet XD
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Oh yeah BUCK....You guys doing well with that?
<Daygon> what are the movies this friday?
<Serenity> Lil_B: Don't worry, you really can't miss Saturn and his very distinctive hair.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Daygon: It's Balto, Te producers.
<Wrek> 05Daygon: its tated on the front page ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01Kawaii_icybeauti: aye, stuff's going well
<Zanon> I need to scan this page prob covering the personal info of mines but yeah i have a retirement account with one penny in it. wonder how much ill get in a few years... dar jpmorgan just get rid of the penny already........
<Daygon> i see
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: looking up flights to go there :$
<Malmortius> HAI GUYS
<FillyFlam> Hiya Malmortius
<MegaMoonShine> Hai Malmortius :)
<Lil_B> Serenity I believe so XD, and it's not as big as Bronycon Anyway, I think 400People or so
<Gold_Demona> Hi Malmortius
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MadSurge: I went to bronycon already, so I had my pony convention fix. I hope to go back next year.
<alexxm> pizza
<Lil_B> hi Malmortius
<alexxm> how've you been doing Malmortius
<Malmortius> good good. good.
<Meanwhile> LimeV, please stop lagging on me.
<Serenity> Lil_B: Would you consider going next year as well?
<Saturn> 08,01"when's the last time you slept?" "over 2 days ago" "want to sleep with me?"
<Lil_B> Serenity yes, maybe I even try toget to BUCK too
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Considering I live so close to bronycon, I don't see why I wouldn't be able to go next year
<Daygon> so its 2 movies and 2 episodes?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Daygon: Eyup
<Saturn> 08,01haha, dat foreshadowing of someone being burned
<Daygon> Coo
<Daygon> dat crack
<Sundaysmile> OH SHI-
<MegaMoonShine> Oh noes! Leak :O
<Serenity> If BUCK is on next year, there's a 70-90% chance I'll be going. But I'll just be hanging around the quiet places. Not a big fan of parties after what my brother did at one :/
<Vivix|Awai> I hate parties
<Vivix|Awai> after concerts I always go home-
<[Alpha]> I knew i should have went to tokyo in tulsa
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: can't wait to meet people from here :$
<AttacktheAndalite> I only attend parties if it's with my friends or family.
<Vivix|Awai> I don't even catch a drink with my friends- I'm terrified of drunk people
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MadSurge: That would rule. I merely met the yutube celebrities at bronycon, but not the people who make this thing.
<Jmo4267> Drunk people are hilarious.
<Serenity> Vivix|Awai: Drunkards are the only things that I worry about, considering one almost kileld me
<Serenity> Killed*
<Vivix|Awai> aagh--yeah
<Lil_B> Vivix|Awai I hate them too, For me it's always loud music I don't like while beeing surrounded by drunken douchbags
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Like when my dad's friend was so drunk he bit the head off a bug.
<MegaMoonShine> O__________0
<Vivix|Awai> ew-
<AttacktheAndalite> Ewww....
<Vivix|Awai> and all the DRAMA
<MegaMoonShine> That is crazy
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Trust me, that was hilarious
<Lil_B> Kawaii_icybeauti dat Protein :)
<AttacktheAndalite> I know bugs have protein but.....
<[Alpha]> I'm glad my family is fulll of happy drunks
<Serenity> My brother gets agressive when drunk, and he gave me a basilical fracture, D:
<Ponies47> Jmo4267: HECK YEAH! Like this one guy who sang the Film Flam brothers song whiel playing TF2 DRUNK! XD
<Vivix|Awai> !
<Ponies47> *while
<Jmo4267> ikr Ponies47
<Vivix|Awai> I drink now and then, but never to get drunk
<Spectrum_Rush> dat seth macfarlane
<MegaMoonShine> He did another one where he sang Winter Wrap Up :D
<Vivix|Awai> so- I've never been durnk, so i dunno if I get angry or anything
<Kawaii_icybeauti> And the guy who puked in the middle of the motorhead soundlist at a concert
<[Alpha]> I think I saw that video :D
<Ponies47> Jmo4267: Yeah! XD
<Ponies47> MegaMoonShine: REALLY? :o
<AttacktheAndalite> My mom said that for my 21st birthday, she's gonna take me out to get drunk.
<MegaMoonShine> Ponies47: Eeeeyup
<Vivix|Awai> !
<[Alpha]> ....?
*Jmo4267 glomps Vivix|Awai !
<Vivix|Awai> I'm 23, never--even considered that for my 21st
<Gold_Demona> Phlox has spoken
<Vivix|Awai> HI!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Well, 99.9% of the time, people begin drinking in high school.
<Jmo4267> HAI!

<Ponies47> My mom LIKES me being a brony. My dad is meh
<Meanwhile> How I learned to stop worrying and look at the pretty colours.
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: was wondering did mips fail?, only relly just noticed you're on limeV
<Lil_B> my mother showed me a coloring book of "littly Fillys" (MLP Knockoff that looks like G3) and asked me if thats the stuff is I was taöking about -.-
<MegaMoonShine> >.>
<Crono_brony> Ponies47: yeah... but i hate how my dad knows that i'm a brony... He teases me for it.
<Vivix|Awai> filly! that knock off is creepy
<fluffle_puff> Pony dreams are best dreams
<Buytoast> why would you people tell otehrs about liking the show?
<[Alpha]> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2480/
<Buytoast> that's asking to be mocked
<Lil_B> good thing the book wasn't for me XD
<[Alpha]> Pony hard
<Ponies47> Crono_brony: My mom likes me watching MLP. My dad is meh and doesn't really care if I do.
<Vivix|Awai> everyone I know knows- don't really get mocked by anyone
<Jmo4267> I'm gonna go run off to have dreams now since it is 3AM. Night everypony and enjoy yourselves. Vivix|Awai, REHEARSE DAMN YOU.
<Sundaysmile> DREAM SEQUENCE
<Zawan> he se ded peps
<Vivix|Awai> Damnit! I'm doing it! Just..skipping notes to type

<RawketLawnchair> Brody.

<Sundaysmile> LOL
<Ponies47> Crono_brony: *Doesn't care
*Jmo4267 glomps Vivix|Awai and runs
<Sundaysmile> Cpt Brony ftw
<Lil_B> Vivix|Awai it sucks that Fillys are everywhere in germany -.- MLP is so rare to be found, couldn't get a single Blindbag :/
<fluffle_puff> :'(
<Vivix|Awai> Ooh that sucks- I found a few at a Toys R Us in city
<Eli> My mom would have me sent to a mental hospital if she knew
<Vivix|Awai> but not the Trixie or any of the cool waves-
<Crono_brony> Ponies47: My sister is a brony. (she prefers brony over the term pegasister.) and she's only 11! that's how we bonded.
<Dark_Horst> mp merchndise is a wasteland here in gemrany
<Serenity> Crono_brony: O_e...word diferent please.
<Serenity> For the love of god
<Vivix|Awai> my sister is older than me, but we usually watch it together now and then
<RainBowJack> his voice sounds vermijar
<Lil_B> my mom and dad "You like MLP? Isn't that for little girls? Whatever." they really didn't care :)
<Vivix|Awai> mlp is hard to find yeah- especially the new cool stuff
<Eli> Lil_B: it's like almost impossible to get any pony merch in middle europe
<Ponies47> Crono_brony: Lucky. My bro wouldn't give the show a chance.
<RainBowJack> issent it sisco?
<Sundaysmile> They have similar cheeks....
<Crono_brony> Ponies47: that sucks!
<[Alpha]> I have repeated it several times but my whole family watches MLP now except one
<MegaMoonShine> I haven't told anyone in my family I'm a brony yet
<Zanon> my son and daughter are bronys and their parents are like isnt that show totally awesome !!
<Serenity> My mum was like "Right, you're 15, and you are watching a fucking 10 year old girl show?" My reaciton: "Shut yer fucking mouth. "
<Lil_B> Eli I saw some at Galleria Kaufhof, but it was duriong a Brony Meetup, andthey bought ALL OF THEM!
<Serenity> Trying not to get dad to know
<RawketLawnchair> No one must know my secret.
<Ponies47> [Alpha]: Who?
<MegaMoonShine> They'd probably be cool about it though
<Eli> Lil_B: ouch...
<Crono_brony> MegaMoonShine: Keep it that way. unless the member is fully trustworthy.
<Serenity> I'm probably dead if pops finds I'mma brony
<Vivix|Awai> my dad don't care- but I don't think he minds
<AttacktheAndalite> My parents look at me weird when I told them I watch MLP
<Vivix|Awai> I never told them though, it was just like "hey you guys sshould check this show out, it's great"
<[Alpha]> The second oldest. I'm the first and he doesn't care much for it.
<Eli> Lil_B: i'm looking all over the local nerd shops, but all i found was G3... :P yeah, not gonna buy that
<Lil_B> Eli well, it was fun seeing the faces of the people XD "Sorry, we are out of Stock... I even checket our Supplies... we didn't sold one in 2 month!"
*RainBowJack hugs Eli
<MadSurge> MegaMoonShine: same, they weren't fazed by me watching PPG (my dad quickly understood it wasn't a normal cartoon for girls :D )
<Wrek> 05my parents probably thought me gay anyways
<Serenity> Eli: Whyyyy? But you can dress Rainbow Dash in Style!
*Eli hugs RainBowJack back
<RawketLawnchair> A bomb.
<Sundaysmile> WARPFIRE
<Dark_Horst> suddenly green
<MadSurge> OSHIIIII
<MegaMoonShine> Oh shiiiiiiiiiiiit!! :O
<AttacktheAndalite> "Aren't you too old to be--" "NOPE.avi"
<Lil_B> Eli I'm planning on just get a High Res Picture and take it to a Print Shop to get it on a T-Shirt XD
<[Alpha]> Wrek my mom called me gay at first :D
<Ponies47> I went to a the theme park with my DJ PON-3 shirt. i bumped into 1 other brony and alot of people we're staring at my shirt like O_o
<MegaMoonShine> Y U derp, chat!?
<Crono_brony> show the references, they will understand. (The big labowski, Star wars, etc.)
*Striker ate a random object
<RawketLawnchair> Fire in space?
<AttacktheAndalite> And that's how that conversation ended.
<RawketLawnchair> But that's wrong.
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: Too old for good cartoons? *squawk* NEVER!!!
<Eli> Lil_B: I'm thinking about shipping some merch over.
<alexxm> dinner
<Ponies47> My dad is a big Star Trek fan. I should him Discord's parts :P
<Serenity> alexxm: Tea
<Vivix|Awai> I want hte NMM doll and Lyra--and Trixie. Ebay!
<Wrek> 05aye
<Serenity> Nose
<Wrek> 05you definetly should
<RawketLawnchair> Trixie is worst pony.
<Meanwhile> ^
<RawketLawnchair> Chrysalis is best pony.
<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: It's because I'm a female and 20. Lolol. My boyfriends parents suspect but they don't give him shit about it.
<Vivix|Awai> yeah, but she does worst the best
<Lil_B> Eli I would do that too, but I always just say "Nah..."
<Serenity> Meanwhile: I was waiting for you to jump in :3
<Ponies47> I would love to have plushies. But THEY COST TO MUCH MONEY! >_<
<Eli> Lil_B: but, since it's not well accepted here i'm going for more suptle stuff. maybe a shirt with Lunas cutie mark, or a white hat with Vinyls. they are my favourites anyways :)
<AttacktheAndalite> Ponies47: I knooooow, riiiiiiiiiiiiight!
<Serenity> Ponies47: Just get some brony to hire some illigal immagrants and the price will lower loads
<Ponies47> AttacktheAndalite: Yeah!
<Ponies47> Serenity: :D
<AttacktheAndalite> Ponies47: I want a Pinkie plushie
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: I'm 6 years older than you and my parents humorously gave up on me being "normal" :D
<Dark_Horst> enterprise just fart
<[Alpha]> :|
<RawketLawnchair> Less than 6 minutes. Ya know, no pressure or anything.
<Ponies47> AttacktheAndalite: From what I heard. Walmart has a Pinkie and Twilight pillows :P
<Lil_B> Eli yeah, I would oly take a shirt that only people who know MLP get it XD
<Vivix|Awai> my parents call me weird all th time, but thye usually say "and that's a good thing"
<Serenity> IMO, there's no such thing as a normal person
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: I can't wait to see what kind of merch BUCK will offer :D
<Dark_Horst> suuure he is
<AttacktheAndalite> Ponies47: FUUUUUUUUU-----I'd never be able to get away with that. I have a four year old niece. She's claimed all my McDonalds' ponies as hers.
<Vivix|Awai> well, statisticly there is, btu everyone is a freak in some way
<Serenity> There's always something fucked up with someone
<Serenity> AttacktheAndalite: Murder her then
<Eli> Lil_B: exactly that was my thought. I think a grey hat with Octavia's cutie mark would be most awesome
<Vivix|Awai> my mother would buy me and my sister MLP toys at mac donalds
<Ponies47> The MLP mer I have is 2 shirts and a brony wristband. I want more but i need a new computer! D:
<Ponies47> AttacktheAndalite: Awwwwwww :<
<AttacktheAndalite> Serenity: Noooooooo~ But she sounds like Pinkie Pie when she says "Hey!"
<RainBowJack> a COLD sonic shower would do
<Serenity> AttacktheAndalite: Murder her anyway >:3
<AttacktheAndalite> She's given up on trying to take my calendar.
<BronyDarth> Hello everypony!
<[Alpha]> http://derpy.me/Kaw7P this shirt should be your answer
<MegaMoonShine> Hello BronyDarth :)
<Lil_B> Eli but I also want one for my last day at school that really is just "BÄÄM, I Like MLP!"
<Sundaysmile> dat morose pause
<Lil_B> hi BronyDarth
<AttacktheAndalite> Serenity: I'm fine with her having the toys cause I bought her some toys as well. As long as she doesn't find my Friendship Express DVD, I'm fine.
<Ponies47> On the last day of freshman year I'm gonna wear my pony stuff. :P
<RainBowJack> haha
<Spectrum_Rush> [Alpha]: at first i was like wat 6_9 , buthen iwas like oh :D
<AttacktheAndalite> Ponies47: All the swag. If I weren't older I'd kiss you
<Ponies47> It's gonna be SO AWESOME /)^3^(\
<RainBowJack> AttacktheAndalite : you can send it to me if you want :P
<MegaMoonShine> Ponies47: Do it! Everyone will love you!
<[Alpha]> You got a be a brony to get it :P
<Lil_B> NASA were best Kerbals
<Ponies47> AttacktheAndalite: Pony shirt and brony wristband. If I got more I can wear buy then I will wear them. :P
<AttacktheAndalite> RainBowJack: Send what to you? The DVD? Sorry but hell no. I went to five different WalMarts looking for it
<[Alpha]> Hey umm a heads up. Hot Topic has MLP trading cards
<Eli> Lil_B: that would be something :) I think I'm just going to order me a white hat with Vinyls mark right now. fit's my Ska style the best ;)
<AttacktheAndalite> [Alpha]: Whut? They do? How much are they?
<Vivix|Awai> I bought a MLP dvd at toys R us, and it was dubbed and did not have original language option ;__;
<[Alpha]> 3.50
<AttacktheAndalite> RainBowJack: :3
<Ponies47> MegaMoonShine: I should and I'm gonna. I should take a picture of myslef as well wearing my pony swag before I head to school that day :P
<AttacktheAndalite> I now have a new purpose in life, and that's pony trading cards.
<Eli> i just wish they would actually set up hot topics around here
<RainBowJack> AttacktheAvdalite : i cant get it here in the netherlands Hasbro Holland doesnt wan to releas it here makes me a sad pony
<Ponies47> AttacktheAndalite: I got a friend who has been collecting those xP
<Eli> I mean, mc donalds does it, why not Hot topic?
<AttacktheAndalite> The closet Hot Topic to me is about 30 minutes away
<RawketLawnchair> http://i.imgur.com/AH4eJ.png Best r63 pony.
<Ponies47> Eli: Hottopic does
<RawketLawnchair> Reptillians?
<[Alpha]> That pictures killed a small part of me
<AttacktheAndalite> RainBowJack: Suuuucks *hugs* One day they will...one day.
*Spectrum_Rush quietly looks through his mlp cards from BronyCon
*RainBowJack hugs AttacktheAvdalite
<Eli> Ponies47: i'm talking about setting up a store in Switzerland/Germany
<Ponies47> I might be going to Cantorlot Gardens. If I do. I'l lget to try out Fighting is Magic and maybe even meet Tara! :D
<BronyDarth> Is rushgamez here?
<Vivix|Awai> Hot topic doesn't exist here either- so if I'm gonna get any ponyswag, EBAY or Welovefine
<AttacktheAndalite> I got a wristband, three shirts, a hat, a calendar, several toys from McDonalds, some blind bag ponies, and a DVD. I just need the belt and the cards and I will be sooo happy.
*Ponies47 Nods at Eli
*RainBowJack hugs AttacktheAndalite
<Lil_B> hi hate that GalaCon isn't getting any big Celebratys :/
<Eli> I really badly want to go to Canterlot Gardens Ponies47... it's on my birthday, but i just don't have the money
<Vivix|Awai> to go to any con I have to shell ou for a passport
<Ponies47> AttacktheAndalite: I have a wristband and 2 shirts. I NEED MORE! But I need a new computer D:
<Vivix|Awai> and with agoraphobia and all that, there's no way I'm leaving the country
<RawketLawnchair> Sound in space?
<RawketLawnchair> Star Trek, pls.
<[Alpha]> http://derpy.me/JxhdO I'm sure Wrek would love this shirt
<Ponies47> Eli: What state do you live in? I live in Wisconsin :P
<Lil_B> RawketLawnchair movie Lagic, Space is the best Soundtransmitter
<AttacktheAndalite> Ponies47: Computer first, so that you can order more ponies.
<RawketLawnchair> Lagic?
<Ponies47> AttacktheAndalite:eeeyup
<AttacktheAndalite> Dat Twilight
<Eli> Ponies47: State? the lovely little country of Switzerland
<RainBowJack> AttacktheAndalite : i really want tha DVD
<Ponies47> Eli: Oh silly me. But Canterlot Gardens is in America.
<Serenity> Ponies47: Ever heard of a plane?
<AttacktheAndalite> RainBowJack: I think the DVD is only in America, plus it's just five episodes on it. But still ponies.
<Ponies47> Serenity: Duh :P
<Eli> Ponies47: I know. I still want to go there :)
<Wrek> 05nope [Alpha]
<Vivix|Awai> there's an australian season dvd
<Vivix|Awai> get zone free player and buy it
<RawketLawnchair> He so angry.
<Wrek> 05if i am to buy a twilight shirt
<Wrek> 05it has to be perfect
<MegaMoonShine> We don't get DVD's where I live :(
<RainBowJack> to bad i wanted a Compleet dvd box set of ponies
<Serenity> Wrek: Why not draw a design and take it to a shirt manufacturer?
<[Alpha]> Sounds like the same dilemma with me and a Derpy Plushie
<RainBowJack> MegaMoonShine : now i dont feel left out
<Vivix|Awai> Australia is working on that RainbowJack
<Wrek> 05Serenity: for what money?
<Lil_B> I still think there needs to be a MLP Soundtrack CD >.<
<Eli> Wrek: You wanna buy a Twilight shirt? :O why would you wanna do that? that movie/book is awefull
<RawketLawnchair> Vivix|Awai: What, a posionous death pony?
<Vivix|Awai> full season dvd
<[Alpha]> :D
<MegaMoonShine> I want a box set too
<Dark_Horst> looks liek australia's exports are gonna experience a peak soon
<RainBowJack> hug him tepal
<Serenity> Wrek: It costs like 20-30 quid in England, so that's around 23-40 euros
<Ponies47> Eli: It's a maybe for me. I really wanna try out Fighting is Magic. Unlike SOMEPONIES here who downloaded the beta version. I didn't and willing to wait and try it out at Canterlot Gardens I hope I can meet Tara as well.
<Serenity> Also, pretty sure about 70% of Asdas do shirt printing
<MegaMoonShine> They do?
<Vivix|Awai> I don't tink Asda's exist very many places
<Eli> Ponies47: yeah, i'm just gonna wait for the official release.
<Vivix|Awai> I've never even heard of it-
<Buytoast> man this guy is a bigger crybaby than my sisters 8 years ago
<Wrek> 05which is money i would spend on food, travel and bills
<Dark_Horst> i dont really see how downloading the beta version of something that will be distributed freely is a crime
<Ponies47> Eli: Yeah. If they are gonna be at Canterlot Gardens might as well give it a try :P
<Saturn> 08,01funny story: if there hadn't been a miscommunication within the BUCK committee, we'd have flown out one of the Fighting is Magic devs and had an exclusive tournament of it at BUCK
<Wrek> 05Buytoast: and you wouldnt cope liek that if your sister died?
<Serenity> Wrek: Never heard of a 30 euro food
<Buytoast> well i mean, it's been like what, months to years sicne the giant laser?
<Wrek> 05Serenity: i think in motnhs, sorry
<CriticKitten> http://mlkshk.com/r/HVBV <--- I saw this coming.
<Vivix|Awai> food is expensive-
<Eli> Dark_Horst: it's destroying the surprise, and it makes it less special if mane6 would have released it
<RawketLawnchair> Saturn: http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/image/811
<Wrek> 05Buytoast: only months, and he had it bottled up i guess
<Buytoast> i mean yeah at first it's crushing but time goes on. you can't change it.
<Dark_Horst> Eli: if you want suprise, dont download it. if other people want no surprise, then it'S their buisiness
<RawketLawnchair> He's recording, not writing.
<RawketLawnchair> Star Trek, pls.
<Eli> the alpha testers just betrayed mane6's trust. "and losing a friends trust is the fastest way to lose a friend..." come on guys
<Dark_Horst> Eli: exaclty. one alpha tester fucked up. no reason to attack the ones who downloaded it when it was up
<[Alpha]> I still want to be surprised
<Wrek> 05seeentimeeentallityyy
<Eli> FOREVER
<Wrek> 05oh well
<Ponies47> Eli: FOOOOOOOOOOEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVEEEERRR!
<Ponies47> *For

<Ponies47> Hey DoctoDoctorWho!
<Daygon> HELLO DOCTOR
<MegaMoonShine> Wb DoctoDoctorWho :)
<Eli> yeah whatever. i just think it was a VERY bitchy thing to do. mane6 is doing a great job
<[Alpha]> :|
<Dark_Horst> i for one completely lost track of it and didnt even know about the leak until a few weeks ago. i'll be surprised anyway
*Ponies47 Throws a hat at the drunk Saturn
<Zanon> Moar star Wrek !
<Hat> Ha ha, time for bronystate!
<Wrek> 05pirate a tripple A game from say EA that is packed with greed and DRM? sure go ahead I wont hold it agaisnt you.
<Wrek> 05pirate an Indie title? fuck off and die in a fire
<Meanwhile> Deeeeeeeaaaaaaaad.
<[Alpha]> ^
<MegaMoonShine> ^^
<Ponies47> ^^^
<DalekKahn> ^^^^
<[Alpha]> ^^^^^^
<FillyFlam> v
<Franek12354> ?
<Eli> yeah Wrek get's the idea
<DoctoDoctorWho> I just finished making my OC, u guys wanna see it?
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: it's not like they woudl earn anything with it, so the usual moral codex doesnt really grip
<Hat> vv
<[Alpha]> Yeah
<Eli> i hope he isn't beeing sarcastic
<Daygon> sure
<MegaMoonShine> Sure, DoctoDoctorWho
<Spectrum_Rush> CALLED IT
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://imgur.com/dgqIl
<Shutterfly> Hey, everypony!
*Ponies47 Is sorry :<
<MegaMoonShine> Hey, Shutterfly :)
<Wrek> 05nice
<Wrek> 05try a little lighter dark blue
<Daygon> nice
<Eli> DoctoDoctorWho: looks somewhat like glaze
<Dark_Horst> the reason we dotn pirate indie titles is becasue the studios behind them need the money. main6 dont earn any money with the finished protect. that line of reasoning doesnt work here
<XylemTube> Hello!
<Dark_Horst> *project
<Shutterfly> is there anything streaming?
<Ponies47> Hey XylemTube
<MegaMoonShine> Hello XylemTube :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> glaze?
<Daygon> PONY
<Dark_Horst> Shutterfly: enterprise
<DalekKahn> Anyone here looked into the startrek bridge simulator?
<Spectrum_Rush> DoctoDoctorWho: woodentoaster
<Shutterfly> Dark_Horst: then why isn't it showing on mine? its just an add...
<Dark_Horst> Shutterfly: get adblock
<Dark_Horst> you'll love it
<Wrek> 05so because they set otu with best intention to create something for the community
<Dark_Horst> no ads anywhere
<Wrek> 05its ok to pirate it?
<Dark_Horst> no
<DoctoDoctorWho> I see, I find It really expresses me
<Dark_Horst> i'm just saying the money thing is off the taböe
<DalekKahn> Stream is skipping around for me :(
<Dark_Horst> beleive me, i'm mad at the prick who broke contract too
<XylemTube> Soo how about that new mars landing?
<Eli> Dark_Horst: but they need the support. and what is better to see happy and friendly faces of people when you give them the finished product? it's like you make someone a really neat present, and that person comes and steals it before you're done
<Wrek> 05my argument still stands im my oppinion
<DoctoDoctorWho> sleeping filly woona ftw!
<[Alpha]> http://derpy.me/MukWB I like this shirt
<Vivix|Awai> I didn't follow all of this, but the reason not to pirate is not solely in money and legal mumbo
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: it's not pirating it if it's free. mane6 have actually said themselves that they think people should feel guilty for playing the leak.
<Hat> Please refrain from throwing rocks into the stream
<Dark_Horst> that's exactly my point
<Dark_Horst> be mad at the guy who uplaoded it
<Saturn> 08,01*shouldn't
<Dark_Horst> not the ones who download it becasue they're curious
<Wrek> 05maybe so Saturn, but it goes agaisnt my morals so i wont
<Wrek> 05free or not
<Eli> Wrek: I couldn't have said it better
<Capfluttershy> who is streming?
<MegaMoonShine> wrek is streaming Capfluttershy

<[Alpha]> okay finding the perfect Twilight Sparkle shirt is beccoming a bit of apain
<Wrek> 05i own all the star trek movies
<Wrek> 05but the only thign i miss is the original DVD box set
<Shutterfly> All we have is Kahn
<Wrek> 05[Alpha] becasue it doesnt exist yet
<Tovler> great. now I have a whelming craving for a Butterfinger.
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: and the animated series
<Wrek> 05and that one
<[Alpha]> I'll look some more and then I'm done searching
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek, what is the perfect Twilight shirt?
<Dark_Horst> there was an animated series?

<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: collectors' one, in which the insides are in 2 parts?

<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Spectrum_Rush> remnants of a discarded plotline, that reed was gay

<Saturn> 08,01i once knew somene called Malcolm Reid
<Everlasting_Joy> "And redemption, an even great one (motivator)."
<Saturn> 08,01shame they can't act.
<Meanwhile> Dohoho

<Chrysalis> Saturn ikr
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: meh. too bitchy

<Zanon> Poor wrek is all alone.
<derpyface> lies
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<Dark_Horst> say, did we ever see a canonical representation of a caitian? besides the animated series?
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek and Saturn in the same room... i sense a fanfic on the horizon
<alexxm> whats a caitian again
<Dark_Horst> i thi k i remember one walking around the voyager in elite force 3
<Dark_Horst> *2
<Everlasting_Joy> Spectrum_Rush: :D
<Saturn> 08,01also, what's Brotherhood of Steel?
<Wrek> 05fallout related
<Alchemist> you dont know? blasphemy!
<Barbetos> So. Who wants to listen to the majestic bag pipe?
<Spectrum_Rush> alexxm: a feline like species
<Zanon> hehe
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: high tech knights from fallout
<Vivix> Brotherhood of Steel was an organization of agressive technology horders in F1-2 and 3 and NV
<Eli> Saturn: whatever it is, it's now brotherhoof of steel
<alexxm> thanks Spectrum_Rush
<Alchemist> and their logo is awsm
<Wrek> 05if you ask me the "PonificatioN" of brotherhood of steel is completly uneccesary
<Meanwhile> Ah yes "Reapers"...
<Barbetos> Apple Jack's Rangers
<Dark_Horst> dammit Saturn, you know unsettingly little about awesome franchises
<derpyface> india?
<Wrek> 05i mean really
<Vivix> though in NV and 3 they are less hostile I think- and in 2 they're not so..agressive
<Ponies47> BACK
<Vivix> I don't they're ponified in any FoE fics
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: i don't play computer games
<Dark_Horst> you're mssing out
<Wrek> 05fuck now i got the urge to play some NV
<Vivix> in my humbe opinion Fallout 1 and 2 are the best rpg's ever made. Ruined JRPG for me completely
<Zanon> playyyyyy
<Spectrum_Rush> alexxm: just a little summary http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Caitian
<RawketLawnchair> Sex robot, sex robot.
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: fallout equestria poniefied them anyway. not a bad job if you ask me
<Chrysalis> jesus it really is borg queen without a load of the tech
<Vivix> Well, not the name. Right?
<Wrek> 05Dark_Horst
<Wrek> 05i mean the name
<Vivix> I think FoE Heroes has a good sight of how--Brotherhood of steel was portrayed in fallout 1 by rumour
<Dark_Horst> ohkay then
<Wrek> 05brotherhood
<Wrek> 05they use the same term
<Wrek> 05in the pony universe
*Underpony is away: DOOM
<Dark_Horst> they call them steelrangers
<Vivix> arent that just STeelhooves group?
<Vivix> not the brotherhood of steel?
*Vivix suddenly unsure
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: nope. they toomk they called themselves applejack's trangers later
<Vivix> oh right-
<Vivix> but I swear No one dubbed them Brotherhood of steel
<Dark_Horst> but steelranger is the common term used for one of the group
<Vivix> oh right, yes
<Wrek> 05still
<Wrek> 05brotehrhoof of steel makes no logical sense
<Vivix> yeah-
<Wrek> 05otehr ponificatiosn of names thsu far has made sense
<Dark_Horst> true. that is rather silly
<Vivix> Man..now I want to play fallout
<Dark_Horst> it'S on steam sale right now
<Vivix> I have yet to try the unofficial patch for fallou 2, that puts in a lot of cut material and removes bugs-
<Vivix> I own all of the fallouts
<Vivix> except the playstation one-
<Dark_Horst> crikey
<Dark_Horst> it WAS
<Alchemist> is there one that removes the time limit?
<Dark_Horst> yesterday
<Vivix> !
<Vivix> Sale over?
<Dark_Horst> pretty fuckin cheap, i might add
<Vivix> to remove the time limit in F1 you have to find the chip
<Vivix> then you can keep playing, because that is not the end of the game
<Vivix> the time limit in f2 is like 200 years?
<Alchemist> Vivix: Im talking about F2, where you have I think 3 in-game years and then the game ends
<Dark_Horst> yeah, they had a big fat banner.fallout 3 GOTY and new vegas ultimate. 7 bucks each
<Vivix> 3 in game years? hm..
<Vivix> I can't remember being hit by the time limit- let me check on the wiki
<[Alpha]> =.=
<Dark_Horst> lol, lizard guy'S contact lense wasnt straight
<Alchemist> its 13 years
<Alchemist> not 3
<DoctoDoctorWho> dem ponies be multiplying
<Alchemist> I've actually reached that 13 years on some occasions because I was just wandering around try to get the special encounters
<Vivix> oh 13 years-
<Vivix> ah yeah- hm
<Meanwhile> Aquatics speak...sonar, for past tense.
<[Alpha]> I've already looked over 2000 t-shirts
<Alchemist> after that I had no time left to wipe everyone out in every settlement :D
<Ponies47> GTG LATER EVERYPONY :)
<Dark_Horst> i wonder what the avians looked like
<MegaMoonShine> Later Ponies47 :)
<Meanwhile> Bye capslock.
<Vivix> Hehehe, that's determination Alchemist
<Vivix> well, I'm trying ot find a complete changelog for the restoration project
<Vivix> but- only found individual patch logs yet
<Ponies47> Very funny Meanwhile :P
<Eli> [Alpha]: and found anything intresting?
<Alchemist> well I had the ammo and the guns, just not the time (I wanted to make sure I've done every quest)
<[Alpha]> Well there was a lot for the other characters but not much for twilight =.=
<Eli> [Alpha]: really? her being the main character you'd think she'd get most attention...
<[Alpha]> http://derpy.me/Vgc8K this is the closest I could find and yes I am frankly irritated by that.
<Eli> then again... Fluttershy's cutenes, Rainbow's coolnes and Pinkies crazynes steal the spotlight
<alexxm> punched
<RawketLawnchair> Fluttershy is a background pony.
<RawketLawnchair> And a very bad one.
<Vivix> http://www.nma-fallout.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=761726#761726 and http://www.nma-fallout.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=761727#761727 are the patches Alchemist
<Vivix> I can't find anythign about the time limit- but there's probably a way to break it
<Eli> RawketLawnchair: don't troll on Flutters. you're gonna have a bad time
<RawketLawnchair> Eli: I speak the truth. And fuck you, I do what I want.
<[Alpha]> Yes a brick of a bad time :|
<Dark_Horst> RawketLawnchair: lemme guess, you like applejack
<Saturn> 08,01t'pol likes messing with them
<Eli> RawketLawnchair: oh I see we're really friendly today... not that i care
<Meanwhile> Fluttershy is not an interesting pony.
<Vivix> Depends what you like
<Meanwhile> Still better than Rainbow Dash though.
<Dark_Horst> oh, this is going to escalate
<Vivix> Nah-
<MegaMoonShine> Lagging for me
<Eli> Dark_Horst: yep... exactly my thinking
<Everlasting_Joy> Incoming flame war. Time for me to abandon ship.
<Vivix> It all just depends on what kinds of characters you enjoy watching
<Wrek> 05Dark_Horst: dont count on it
<[Alpha]> :S
<Vivix> and that's--the end of that
<Eli> have fun. i'll be back in 10
<Wrek> 05no Eli
<[Alpha]> I love them all so this would be a weird conversation for me
<HellsFortune> hello ppl
<Vivix> I do enjoy them all, in different ways
<Eli> ok if Wrek wan't me to stay...
<Vivix> Helloo
<HellsFortune> hmm star trek me thinks ?

<RawketLawnchair> They are all being played for fools.
<Everlasting_Joy> Manipulation at its finest.
<Vivix> Woops, broke my scroll
<Vivix> and chat
<Meanwhile> Finest? She doesn't sound believable at all.
<[Alpha]> I'm going to look through the entire archive of t-shirts and then I'm done.
<Vivix> Broke ma chat, bebee
<HellsFortune> trust him, hes an engineer
<Dark_Horst> or not
<MegaMoonShine> Oh shit! :O
<HellsFortune> death from above ?
<Vivix> Ooh, I remember this
<CCCP> Meanwhile hai!
<Meanwhile> No.
<Chrysalis> oh cheer up Meanwhile it might never happen
<[Alpha]> I've finished looking through the whole archive of shirts
<Saturn> 08,01was he wearing red?
<MegaMoonShine> Noooooo he ded!
<Wrek> 05yes
<Chrysalis> damnit
<Meanwhile> Generic redshirt! nooo!
<Vivix> He really was?
<Chrysalis> never send redshirts on awake missions
<Wrek> 05well
<Wrek> 05he was the equivalent
<CCCP> Meanwhile no saying hi?
<Dark_Horst> well, his name was red, as in never mentined before
<andy> are we discussing foe?
<daring_derpy> that's what redshirts are for
<Vivix> Gege
<RawketLawnchair> F O E
<Vivix> yeah
<andy> man i loved that
<andy> read it in like a couple weeks
<Vivix> me too
<Vivix> We were discussing fallout earlier, and some foe was mentioned
<andy> ever played metro 2033?
<Dark_Horst> read it as it came out. the cliffhangers were agonizing
<MegaMoonShine> Took me quite a while to read
<Vivix> yyeah, up until the library thing, then I lost my save
<andy> ahh that sucks
<Vivix> Ah nice Dark_Horst
<MegaMoonShine> I read
<Vivix> I read it long after, loved it so much-
<andy> something special about this post apocalypse things
<MegaMoonShine> I kinda read it as it came out too
<Vivix> combines all the things I like, queer romance, light action, fallout, and ponies
<Dark_Horst> andy: never played fallout?
<andy> oh yea
<andy> many times over
<[Alpha]> http://derpy.me/pxg3Q this one is nice
<Chrysalis> inb4 dead
<andy> working on new vegas now
<Vivix> I haven't restarted metro yet- but I have to finish it
<CCCP> Chrysalis hai!
<Dark_Horst> loved the game. was all over the fanfic
<Chrysalis> hai CCCP
<Vivix> I loved NV, evne if the story wasn't--AS captivating as F3
<Dark_Horst> much fangasmw as had
<Vivix> atm I'm reading Fallout Equestria Heroes
<Vivix> after that I'm gonna try new beginnings
<andy> yea nv in my opinion isnt quite as good as f3
<andy> maybe just because im getting tired of the game mechanics
<MegaMoonShine> I was gonna read Project Horizons but never really got around to it
<Vivix> yeah- it's got better gameplay and moral choices, btu the story just didn't capture me as much
<Wrek> 05i enjoyed NV more than i enjoyed FO3
<Wrek> 05it was a nice adition
<[Alpha]> And I'm done no more shirts for me =.=
<Vivix> I liked the GAMEplay and --atmosphere more, but the main story not as much
<Dark_Horst> sitting on heroes now too. bit too depressing at times, but interesting none the less
<daring_derpy> bad lighting means someone will die
<andy> definately worth playing
<Wrek> 05but both games lacked features from eachother
<Vivix> FNV was also made by a lot of the original creators of the fallout universe
<andy> agreed
<Vivix> including many things from the original F3
<Dark_Horst> i like the concept of having a dumb fuckup as the maincharacter
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> F2 has the most fun dumbfuck mainchar option
<RawketLawnchair> Ooooh shit
<Vivix> if you have under 2 in int you can't speak properly
<CCCP> RawketLawnchair hai
<andy> lol
<andy> thats hilarious
<Vivix> I remember screaming "Grr!! Me hungry!" to people
<andy> thats pure genious
<MadSurge> Hello CCCP! :)
<daring_derpy> never played a low int char in fallout
<Vivix> I looved that
<RawketLawnchair> Well shit.
<CCCP> hello MadSurge!!!!! 8huggies*
<Vivix> I think same happens in fallou 1
<MegaMoonShine> Later, gonna go get food
<alexxm> ded
<Vivix> I lsot most of my int in a mentats..overdose
<Dark_Horst> daring_derpy: was talking about one of the pony fanfics B)
<[Alpha]> I'm skeptical about atking a nap at this moment because last time I went to sleep for 6 hours having several different dreams
<MegaMoonShine> Brb
<[Alpha]> taking
<Vivix> drugs were never as scary in F3 or NV as they were in the original games
<[SWAG]Haku> What is it that we are watching?
<MadSurge> Oh wow, that corner got crouded XD
<Buytoast> so goomba decided to kill nice guy?
<andy> star trek enterprise
<[SWAG]Haku> hmm
<andy> i love the doctor in enterprise
<Dark_Horst> tapeworm. why not
<MadSurge> Derpy is secretly half bat :D
<andy> awesome charachter
<Saturn> 08,01hehehe
<Meanwhile> Rofl. Dat medical procedure.
<andy> oh god tapeworm is the worst
<Saturn> 08,01the ol' tapeworm diet
<daring_derpy> we agreed to never talk about this, MadSurge
<[Alpha]> :D
<andy> just saying it
<Vivix> I wonder if F4 will have feautures from Fnv
<Vivix> if it ever comes
<Dark_Horst> i doubt that
<andy> i think nv is supposed to be f4
<Vivix> I live in hope-
<andy> in a way
<Dark_Horst> the fallout franchise played in a lot, right now bethesda is sitting on elder scrolls online
<Vivix> well NV was different company and all- but maybe
<andy> same mechanics as 3
<Vivix> oh god- I hope htey don't die the way Blizzard did
<Vivix> mmo games are freaky expensive to upkeep
<andy> one could argue that a 4 wouldnt be out of place
<daring_derpy> traditional
<daring_derpy> ?
<[Alpha]> :S
<Meanwhile> I wasn't aware Blizzard died.
<Vivix> whatnow?
<Vivix> well, not really
<Dark_Horst> if they ever make another fallout, i pray it will be in the style of 3
<Vivix> but after wow they've only made like 3 games
<daring_derpy> one failed paratrooper drop meansup to 70%
<Dark_Horst> nv had awesome content itemwisew
<Vivix> Kinda- I hope they avoid horrible tings like that optimus prime
<Dark_Horst> but the whole cowboy-thing just didnt fit
<Vivix> but- they better include ironsights and no set essentials and such from NV
<Vivix> I did think the cowboy angle was a bit silly-
<derpyface> lol i just came back after an afk break for 10 minutes and the first thing i see are talking fish people with arms
<andy> i agree cowboys dont fit in fallout
<derpyface> nuff said
<Vivix> but it is lasvegas and full of old--"for show" stuff
<Vivix> I loved how in.. F2 if you parked your car in new reno, sometimes someone would steal it and put it in a chop shop
<andy> you could get cars in f2 O.o
<Dark_Horst> andy: yep
<Vivix> yeah
<Chrysalis> HAAAAAAAAAAAX
<Vivix> old nuclear power cars
<andy> oh man gotta love the nuclear powered cars
<Everlasting_Joy> Could you put explosives in the car?
<Dark_Horst> andy: neccessary. the map was spread over the whole coast. you had to cross badlands to get from location to location
<Vivix> not to blow it up I think, not sure
<Vivix> you could probably put a timed bomb in your boot
<Dark_Horst> i just loved how the wrecks in 3 and NV blow up
<Vivix> yeahh
<Dark_Horst> nuclear power EVERYWHERE
<andy> oh yea that is epic
<Everlasting_Joy> I'd laugh, "Try to jack my car? Drive away with a 'gift'!"
<Meanwhile> This is surprisingly reminiscent of the ME3 Crucible.
<Chrysalis> this fights alot less epic
<Dark_Horst> they even had fission in batteries
<Vivix> I love the lore behind it
<Chrysalis> if you mute it
<Chrysalis> as though its actually in space
<daring_derpy> the whole game world was more believable in f1 and 2. the decay in fnv looks not like 250 years. it looks not even like 50 years after the war
<Vivix> hehe
<[Alpha]> Nuka Cola......I wonder what it taste like
<Vivix> the thing with fallout universe is-
<Vivix> it's based on how it was viewed from the 50s
<sagas> Whathe hell?
<Vivix> that's why there's no nuclear winter or anything
<andy> apparently nuca cola was radioactive before the bombs
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: not... really?
<Saturn> 08,01DUN DUN DUUUN
<Unnr|Laptop> *GASP*
<Saturn> 08,01</rainbow dash>
<Vivix> what I didn't like in F3 was how ..3dog acted, and how he spoke of trees as if they were legends
<Dark_Horst> andy: yep. they made quantum by adding an isotope. would make for glowing pee too
<Meanwhile> Dark_Horst: A big floating sphere with one group of ships defending it from attackers?
<Vivix> while forests were present in fallout 2
<Chrysalis> andy yup, and quantum was heralded because it glowed due to its radioactivity
<Vivix> Yeaah, I love all those crazy history things you read in Fallout
<andy> i think i just missed the entire episode because of this conversation
<Vivix> hehehe
<Chrysalis> as was radium when it was first discovered and its effects unknown
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: not nearly enough to recemble ME3
<andy> how do i ping people
<Dark_Horst> yes, palyed it
<[Alpha]> andy like this
<Vivix> just write their name
<andy> alpha
<Saturn> 08,01time for some food!
<daring_derpy> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Nucleon must have been an awesome time, the early nuclear age...
<andy> did it work?
<Dark_Horst> the ME3 scenario was completely different
<Vivix> no you have to write it exactly as it is
*Saturn 08,01steals andy
<Vivix> for alpha just type [A and hit tab
<andy> lol
<[Alpha]> You have to have all the characetrs in order for it to work
<andy> i got stolen
<Meanwhile> Dark_Horst: Specifically the Crucible part.
<Saturn> 08,01hahahaha
<Dark_Horst> i know what you mean
<andy> <Vivix>
<Unnr|Laptop> Saturn, no stealing random ponies
<Vivix> ho you dont need the <
<Vivix> but yes it worked!
<andy> Vivix
<Saturn> 08,01but... i want to feed him icecream
<Vivix> yep, there you go
*Saturn 08,01sighs
<Barbetos> I step away from my computer and then suddenly I hear rainbow dash
<Saturn> 08,01fine
<Dark_Horst> but that'S like saying this is like that one time in star wars when the death star was defended by the empire
*Saturn 08,01steals Unnr|Laptop instead
<Unnr|Laptop> Saturn what if he is lactose intolerant?
<andy> yes i am totally fine with being stolen if i get ice cream
<alexxm> he got disentergated
<andy> ill eat it anyway :D
<Saturn> 08,01stabbity stab stab
<Meanwhile> Dark_Horst: I'd hardly say it was completely different, it's a large space based weapon being escorted to a destination and happens to be of similar visual appearance.
<[Alpha]> It's "Homemade"
*Unnr|Laptop is stolen
<Unnr|Laptop> Nuuuuuue
<Zanon> Im gonna make a rogue to stab things
<AndroUser> Hello every pony =D
<[Alpha]> :D
<andy> lol wonder what that means
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy AndroUser.
<daring_derpy> hallo AndroUser :)
<AndroUser> Waaaait
<Unnr|Laptop> Is this... enterprise?
<cachi01|phone> Yay
<daring_derpy> yes
<andy> yea
<cachi01|phone> Better
<Dken2021> allo y'all
<cachi01|phone> Hi dken!
<Unnr|Laptop> Ohai Dken2021
<Buytoast> oh shit they kidnapped jackie chan
<Lil_B> maybe I should just pin the Headphoes I want on a Dart Plate and pick which one I'll by like that -.-
<Saturn> 08,01those reptilians are quite hot
<Chrysalis> Saturn you have some odd tastes
<Meanwhile> Their "hair" is offputting.
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: you find anything with dacial plates hot
<Vivix> My friends keep telling me to buy headphones--
<Dark_Horst> *faciakl
<daring_derpy> oooooh...the procedure ^^
<Dark_Horst> **facial
<Dark_Horst> DAMMIT
<cachi01|phone> Saturn has some weird fetish
<Saturn> 08,01i'm just open minded
<Vivix> some insectoids are crazy sexy
<[Alpha]> JUst do what you want
<Barbetos> THis music just ruins the mood of the scene
<Vivix> but--I don't find THOSE attractive
<Barbetos> lol
<Dken2021> Vivix how much are you willing to pay?
<Dark_Horst> especially about facial plates
<andy> i love the intro
<Chrysalis> Barbetos but it is the 2nd best opening ever
<Vivix> for headphones? I'm being pressured- so I dunno
<Lil_B> yyeah... this Intro doesn't say "Star Trek" for me XD
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: chantho from doctor who was *very* sexy
<[Alpha]> Saturn don't let your brain fall out
<Vivix> I need new speakers before then- I blew out my monitors
*Vivix googles
<andy> used to watch this with my cousins and we'd sing along with the intro as loud as we could
<Saturn> 08,01[Alpha]: ah, a tim minchin fan?
<Barbetos> Chrysalis I want to see kerbals streamed while this song plays XD
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: i think it hit the whole "past the boundaries"-explorer thing a lot better than the standart intro
<[Alpha]> I don't know who that is
<Dken2021> dat giggle
<RawketLawnchair> Pinkie please go
<Vivix> Saturn: A bit too long head for me- but like..you know like.almost like the ones in Alien
<Chrysalis> Saturn who ISNT a tim minchin fan, the mans a genius
<Vivix> they can be--attractive
<Tyler_The_Creator> What are we watching now?
<Saturn> 08,01[Alpha]: google him
<cachi01|phone> I cry when kerbals deserve to die :(
<[Alpha]> NO
<Unnr|Laptop> Chrysalis: Gingers?
<Tyler_The_Creator> Wat iz dis
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst maybe I just like the original orchestra more XD
<Dark_Horst> asari are hot
<andy> what do they need hoshe for?
<Buytoast> hot
<Buytoast> lizard
<Zanon> i gotta buy enterprize nao
<Buytoast> dick
<Vivix> Asaris are cute, but a little too human to be different
<Tyler_The_Creator> "im sure"
<Dark_Horst> andy: she's the shp's comm officer and linguist
<Meanwhile> They want her to decode a missing key to the weapon.
<[Alpha]> Good thing I shortened my name it used to be 17 characters long
<andy> thanks
<Dark_Horst> andy: probably the best in current and future starfleet
<cachi01|phone> I heard there is a kickstarter thing for building the enterprise replica
<Dken2021> Vivix hey, found you a headphone guide if you're interested http://i.imgur.com/YckrO.jpg
<Vivix> Thanks!
<Vivix> I am going to need speakers before then- but yeah
<Unnr|Laptop> Vivix, to the fair asari ar strongy psychic, and its assumed that they subconciously project an idealized body form...
<Vivix> I'm planning m-Audio speakers
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/aN7xP dww
<CCCP> dawww*
<Saturn> 08,01m-audio are quite good
<Vivix> Mm--that sounds pretty cool
<Vivix> my friends all use m-audio
<Dken2021> mmm, glob ice cream <3
<Saturn> 08,01but i had a set of m-audio IE10s, and they were uncomfortable as sin
<Vivix> so--I figured maybe I should give them a go, I currently use cheap Empire speakers
<andy> that scares me a little
<Everlasting_Joy> CCCP: Aww. . . I love ice cream.
<Lil_B> Dken2021 wow, exactly what I need atm XD
<Vivix> oh you mean headphones? hm-
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<Vivix> Well, if I buy M-Audio monitors I might aswell look at m-audio headphones too
<CCCP> Everlasting_Joy ponies + icecream = best thing
<[Alpha]> In Soviet Russia IceCream loves you
<andy> i like how they did the sphere map
<Saturn> 08,01i'm rockin' a pair of Etymotic ER-4Ps
<Everlasting_Joy> CCCP: Darn toot'n!
<Saturn> 08,01they're *wonderful*
<Vivix> Thing is, I use speakers when I rehearse- so they have to hit around--80-90db I guess
*Vivix googles
<CCCP> lol
<Unnr|Laptop> The only thing I don't agree with that guide is that that Skullcandy lowest end buds aren't bad for the price point
<Everlasting_Joy> RE4 vibes anyone?
<Vivix> Oo- those look good Saturn- noise suppression too
<daring_derpy> sounds cool. Inject the parasites!
<[Alpha]> Well they are overated and fall apart easily
<Dken2021> holy injection batman
<Lil_B> Saturn what kind of headphones are these?
<alexxm> that had to hurt
<[Alpha]> I was talking about Skullcandy
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: they cost me about £130, but they usually got for between £200 and £300
<Vivix> I used to use Koss padded earplugs when playing drums, but I can't set up the kithere
<Unnr|Laptop> [Alpha]: everything but their bottom barrel stuff
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: professional reference monitors
<andy> skullcandy pings me
<daring_derpy> they should have a painless procedure for the injection
<daring_derpy> makes it creepier
<Vivix> hm well- if they're good enough for reference monitoring I might consider them for mixing
<Unnr|Laptop> once you get above 30$ pricepoint, their drivers start becoming shit for the pricepoint
<Vivix> but I've always been told to get monitors for that-
<Lil_B> Saturn is Saturn is that similar too Studio work?
<Saturn> 08,01for cheap and cheerful, i have a pair of Sennheiser MX470s
<Saturn> 08,01they cost me £15, and they're good
<Unnr|Laptop> Oooh, Saturn I am jealous of your monitors
<[Alpha]> oooh sennheiser is agood brand
<Saturn> 08,01not fantastic, but great for the price
<Vivix> hmm-
<Vivix> I was looking aat-
<Vivix> Excuse my slow net
<Vivix> We are relocating the jam/rehearse thing to a basement, so we're looking to buy PA, but I really need monitors and--MAYBE headphones of that quality for my home studio thing
<[Alpha]> My back >.<
<MahBoi777> hello?
<Vivix> Hello!
<Dken2021> mmyes?
<[Alpha]> I just scared the crap ouit of my mothyer and she attacked me :D
<MahBoi777> lol
<Lil_B> I'm looking at Audio-Technica ATH-M50, Shure SRH840 and 2 Sennheiser HD Models but I just can't decide
*Lil_B hugs MahBoi777
*MahBoi777 hugs Lil_B back
<Everlasting_Joy> MahBoi777, this "howdy" is what all true warriors strive FOUR!
<Chrysalis> so much wasted soace
<Chrysalis> space*
<Vivix> From Sennheiser I'm looking to buy e906 and a betamic-
<Vivix> are their speakers good?
<Vivix> Damn- the shop I frequent no longer carries m-audio
*MahBoi777 glomps Everlasting_Joy
<Lil_B> Sennheiser is usually good quality :/ I once had In-Ear Headphones from them at 20€, they were good
<Vivix> but I was looking at the 500 dollar range
<MahBoi777> HEY Everlasting_Joy! how have you been?^^
<Lil_B> ok, 500$ Range isn't my ligue XD
<Vivix> Hehe, well these are speakers and not headphones
<Vivix> so- it's not that bad concidering the competition
<Everlasting_Joy> MahBoi777: It's been busy and ugly, I'll just leave it at that.
<andy> t'pol is going crazy
<Dj_Cyber-4G> eww star trek?
<Vivix> what about KRK guys? Anyone tried?
<Wrek> 05eew Dj_Cyber-4G?
<Vivix> no srry SLX*
<daring_derpy> they broke their vulcan
<Lil_B> I hate it XD, all 4 Headphones have good Revies and have similar specs >.<
<Dj_Cyber-4G> 0_0
<Dark_Horst> daring_derpy: that'S what happens when you snort toxic space rocks
<MahBoi777> Everlasting_Joy: well I hope everything gets better for you.
<Vivix> http://www.sound1.com/portal/asp/produktdetalj1.asp?Produkt_ID=4839 I was looking at these
<Dj_Cyber-4G> KILL HIM KILL HIM
<[Alpha]> :S
<Vivix> Eh- english site would be better
<Michael> hai everypony, how you doing? :)
<Lil_B> Vivix can I switch this into english?
<MegaMoonShine> hai Michael :)
<daring_derpy> hi Michael :)
<andy> hey Michael
<Dj_Cyber-4G> let the bass cannon kick it!
<CCCP> hi Michael
<Vivix> nnot that one- but you can find it on thomann
<Everlasting_Joy> MahBoi777: It will. It's the uncertanty that's killing me.
*Michael hugs MegaMoonShine daring_derpy andy CCCP
<Everlasting_Joy> MahBoi777: How are you?
<Michael> yay star trek enterprise
<andy> whats a good generation of start trek?
<MahBoi777> Everlasting_Joy: I am doing fine, thank you:)
<Flying_Narwhal> What pony is that on the bottom left corner?
<Vivix> Wrek
<Vivix> ..right?
<Wrek> 05aye
<Vivix> You're so cute
<[Alpha]> :D
<andy> aww he's so cwute
<Wrek> 05why thank you
<daring_derpy> you smoke?
<Vivix> These were the ones I looked at originally: http://www.thomann.de/gb/m_audio_bx8_d2.htm
<andy> have you considered buying used speakers?
<Vivix> The trend on smoking in Norway is terrible, a lot of 19 yearolds snuff instead, and spit it out eeverywheere- during musicschool we found it in windowsills- computer benches, floor- classrooms- ugh
<Vivix> Nno- not really, but I might look at the usedmarket if I decide on something specific
<daring_derpy> god no...
<Michael> lol skyla?
<Michael> wtf
<MegaMoonShine> That toy...
<MegaMoonShine> O_______________________________________-
<daring_derpy> you know what this means. g4.5
<[Alpha]> Is creepy
<Vivix> I should probably get a second set of speakers for loud sounds, Monitors are made for low sounds-
<Spectrum_Rush> dat dari-bot post...
<Alchemist> cadence and shining armor's kid maybe?
<Michael> is scary as hell
<Michael> nu please
<Vivix> After cadence didn't turn out to be a disaster, I trust them completely
<andy> how can a monitor be made for low sound?
<Wrek> 05and so we welcome the offspring of cadenza and shining cant-keep-his-dick-in-control
<Dken2021> did somebody say more executive meddling?
<Vivix> well, they're not made to play loud, but to play correctly at a comfortable level
<Chrysalis> Wrek wtf
<cowvarkian> whats with the star trek enterprise
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Oh god :D
<Michael> omg Wrek
<Vivix> oh and let me explain, a monitor is what you call that kind of speaker
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek :D
<andy> i see
<MegaMoonShine> lol Wrek :$
<Vivix> you monitor the sound, so to speak
<andy> makes more sense now:)
<cachi01|phone> Wrek xd
<Spectrum_Rush> well Wrek when your wife a hotty its kinda hard... :S
<Zanon> XD Wrek
<Eli> lucky the cartoon version doesn't look anything like the toy. otherwise i would have to ask the doctor to have a trip over to equestria and do and abortion...
<Alchemist> I wonder, was he hitting Chrysalis too?
<Buytoast> oh shit they made another abort-failed abomination?
<Vivix> Depends on his views on premarital boink
<[Alpha]> :S
<Spectrum_Rush> Alchemist: what better way then to get love... :S
<Chrysalis> aw sheet more lights are flashing
<Tovler> O_O… *goes back to lurking*
<Chrysalis> things must be gettin bad
<Dken2021> anyone know the brand of these earbuds here? I've had then a long time and they're like the best I had http://imgur.com/j5w47
<otakon> damn he's ugly
<andy> classic star trek to have flashy lights everywhere
<Eli> sooo anyone around with enough artistic talent to draw the child of Chrysalis and Armor?
<Dashee> Hi everypony :)
<Vivix> Isn't that the samsung logo?
<Dken2021> allo Dashee
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Dashee.
<Vivix> I've seen it before-
<MegaMoonShine> Hi Dashee :)
<Dark_Horst> AAAAW YEAH
<cachi01|phone> Dken sony walkman
<Spectrum_Rush> USE ALL THE SHIPS!!!
<Dark_Horst> shit<'S gonna go down
<Vivix> Ooh! yes sony
<Michael> hai Dashee
<Alchemist> Eli: it will turn out tpo be zombie vinyl
<Dashee> :D
<cachi01|phone> Dken2021 sony walkman
<killerpony7733> Dken2021: Walkman i believe
<Eli> Alchemist: yeah, that might hit it
<Dken2021> cachi01|phone killerpony7733 ah thanks
<Dark_Horst> look what i have in my hangar. it's an enterprise!
<Spectrum_Rush> the Hu-mans
<Lil_B> the humans!
<andy> amazed that the enterprise is still in one piece
<Dark_Horst> shoot everything!
<Vivix> They should make a show named Enterprise, the early years. Just all abot building it
<daring_derpy> aim for the green buttons
<Vivix> Construction workers hanging out
<Spectrum_Rush> its a tough little ship, the NX-01
<andy> im not sure how interesting that would be
<Vivix> It would probably onl run half a season-
<cachi01|phone> Enterprise the early years. When enterprise was a little rebel ship
<Wrek> 05i even have the cap with the NX-01 on it
<Vivix> hehehe
<andy> cap?
<Wrek> 05exactly the same like the one used in the show during desert missions
<andy> nice
<Vivix> Allow me to scream nerd
<Vivix> no, that's prety cool
<daring_derpy> why does no one in the star trek universe has automated defense systems on his ship?
<Dashee> Nerds!
<Dark_Horst> from what i've gathered, the enterprise nx is also the prototype of the later akira class, one of the classes that makes up the main-muscle of starfleet
<Dark_Horst> *nerd*
<andy> i once had a urge to get a enterprise pizza cutter. that urge passed quickly
<Meanwhile> I find it ironic that the fish people have the strongest military.

<andy> stormtroopers are supposed to be highly trained clones. kind of ironic how easy they die
<Striker> nope
<Chrysalis> all he had to do was wait behind a wall
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Vivix> Aren't the storm troopers alive?
<andy> yea
<alexxm> did he die

<Vivix> I never knew they were clones-
<Dashee> maybe

<Dark_Horst> Dashee: it'S the newest star trek series
<Polydunami> Hmm...
<Vivix> a totally legitimate dialect, but often silly on movies
<Polydunami> Star Trek?

<andy> ikea is pretty good for food
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: where?
<Vivix> Yeah, they got some good stuff
<andy> nobody expects that
<Vivix> hehe yeahh
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: there are no klingons herw
<andy> we need klingons on the enterprise
<cachi01|phone> Klingons never surrender
<Alchemist> only lizard men
<Meanwhile> Dark_Horst: I was making a joke on lingon.
<Dashee> nom nom nom
<Michael> ewwww
<MegaMoonShine> No not the mousies! :'(
<Everlasting_Joy> Yum!
<Vivix> poor mice ;__;
<Dken2021> those poor mice
<otakon> well that's disturbing
<Vivix> so damn cute
<daring_derpy> tasty
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: okay then
<andy> ominous music while eating mice
<cachi01|phone> Klingons eat lizard men for breakfast
<Dashee> juicy!
<Chrysalis> and mood breaking music
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/X61Z-
<Vivix> The muisc almost always crash with the intro
<Meanwhile> And lizard men apparently eat mice for breakfast.
<daring_derpy> that's racist!
<Michael> http://derpy.me/AH812
<andy> it seems somwehat logical
<Dark_Horst> and klingons are scared of tribbles
<cachi01|phone> Mice eat klingon for breakfas
<Everlasting_Joy> CCCP: Optimus is like "I'm o.k. with this."
<Dark_Horst> tribbles must be some hardass motherfuckers
<andy> in soviet russia
<CCCP> Everlasting_Joy haha
*Underpony is back (gone 01:18:12)
<daring_derpy> derpy is best pony
<Meanwhile> Tribbles. Tribbles everywhere.

<andy> no!
<MegaMoonShine> Wb Underpony :)
<Michael> derpy + TTGL : win
<Vivix> Haha
<Vivix> Spectrum, the irony
<Michael> hai Underpony
<cachi01|phone> Spectrum used to be an adventurer like you
<daring_derpy> hello Underpony
<Dken2021> Spectrum_Rush so you got hitched?
<cachi01|phone> But then he took an arrow to the knee
<cachi01|phone> Yay
<Underpony> hey guys :3
<Vivix> I went through fallout with Moiras modified vault suit, I can't do the same in Skyrim- I neeed better armor
<Dken2021> ello ThunderStrike
<Vivix> But it HAS to be light armor
<cachi01|phone> Hi under!
<andy> people should learn to thicken their knee armour if they want to keep their adventuring career
<Dken2021> er.... under
<Wrek> 05i enver cared for the vault suit in fallout
<ThunderStrike> Dken2021: hm?
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: light armor worked for me
<Vivix> most of my armor has no pants
<Wrek> 05i prefered the "RP" as the lone sniper
<Dken2021> ThunderStrike sorry, wrong ping
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: smith your own
<Vivix> ah yeah, NV is better for RP
<Vivix> my smithing is like 0..
<Vivix> or 13
<MadSurge> Can we agree to not stream any Star Trek tomorrow? ;__;
<ThunderStrike> Dken2021: oh, okay
<cachi01|phone> I has daedric armor.buck yeah
<andy> i always went for max positive karma in f3
<Vivix> in NV I used..the stealth armor from big empty
<Wrek> 05MadSurge: umad?
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: you should change that. it will be worht your while
<Spectrum_Rush> Vivix: god i no the feel doing a mage right now and i dont have armer just yet /)_-
<Meanwhile> U MadSurge?
<Vivix> hehe yeah-
*Striker is now eating a hotdog
<cachi01|phone> Ewww a dog
<Vivix> I'm an archer using leather armor, but I need something stronger and yet light
<Dken2021> Spectrum_Rush so this what happened to you? http://derpy.me/NGuwT
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: small guns at 100 FTW /)
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: elven
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: then glass
<Vivix> yyees- but I haven't found either
<Dark_Horst> the highest in light is dragonscales
<Vivix> I've found EBONY armor, but I can't use that
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: you dont find. you forge B)
<Vivix> oh really? Hmm..
<Spectrum_Rush> Dken2021: no literally arrow -> my knee = me ded
<andy> i love dragonscale light armour
<MadSurge> Wrek: no, I'm happy for all trekkies in the chat. I'd just like to pay more attention to it :D
<Vivix> I have no forge skiills ;__;
<cachi01|phone> Vivix get daedric
<cachi01|phone> Ohh
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: they're easy to aqquire
<Vivix> isn't that super heavy?
<Wrek> 05waht MadSurge?
<Alchemist> Vivix: if you are using light armour then dragon or glass is best choice
<cachi01|phone> Vivix yeah but its best armor
<Vivix> Okay- yeah I should try to--train up for dragon
<andy> glass can be better than dragon>
<andy> ?
<Spectrum_Rush> Vivix: make lots of leaether bracers then sell by more leather repeat
<Vivix> but I can't heav hevy armor, I'm a hoarder
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: just spam leather armor at the forge. also look for mines. iron is good to to simply increase your skill
<Vivix> ah yeah- okay
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: the left branc in smithing is light amror only
<cachi01|phone> Vivix then light dragonbone armor
<Vivix> ah okay, cool
<Alchemist> andy: I think the armor rating difference is marginal but the glass is much lighter
<MadSurge> Wrek: Star Trek makes me want to play games and I don't pay much attention to the chat :D
<andy> k makes sense
<otakon> Boo!
<Wrek> 05heh
<Wrek> 05not many eps left anyways
<Vivix> In F I liked using super light and low level armor, because I could move fast and carry more
<Vivix> I didn't die that often-
<andy> if your high level you wont need high armor anyway
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: theres still season 4
<Meanwhile> andy: you're*
<Vivix> the only thing that bugs me in Skyrim atm is dragons
<cachi01|phone> Bitch please
<Dark_Horst> i hope this arc finishes sooon, gotta get up early tomorrow
<Vivix> most of them refuse to land- just--they're eeverywhere
<andy> how can that bug you
<andy> dragons are awsome
<cachi01|phone> Just use some arrows
<Striker> why are you guys talking about Skyrim?
<Vivix> well, they're sexy and cool, but they're Eeeverywhere cause I ignored them for so long
<Alchemist> and heavy armor is better because you can get a blessing from the steed stone which negates all movement difficulties of the heavy armor
<Spectrum_Rush> God Damn it dwemer ruins why u so big :[
<Vivix> but then I can carry less
<otakon> Spectrum_Rush: bc Dwemer
<Dken2021> Striker because why not?
<Vivix> I've always played light characcters in my games, cause I pick up Eeeverything
<Alchemist> no, the steed stone negates that
<Dark_Horst> dwemer ruins are awesome. full of dwarven emtal. good for smiting skil
<Dashee> Anyone max lvl here?
<Spectrum_Rush> why hello otakon , whened you get here
<Vivix> it negates that too?
<andy> i always go light as well more fun
<Vivix> Hm..
<Alchemist> yep
<Dark_Horst> if you choose the havy branch, that is
*Michael is max lvl
<Vivix> ah-
<cachi01|phone> Dashee me
<otakon> lAG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<otakon> Spectrum_Rush: a while ago
<Dken2021> otakon , you seem to pop in and out sometimes, hello
<Vivix> I've lplayed on and off since release, I'm still level 25
<Vivix> Ha
<otakon> hiya Dken2021
<otakon> okay brb my food is a calling
<andy> he sees himself
<Alchemist> Vivix: http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/The_Steed_Stone_%28Skyrim%29
<andy> time paradox
<MadSurge> Wrek: hope I don't sound like an asshole though...
<Wrek> 05well thats how you came out
<cachi01|phone> MahBoi777!
<Striker> has anyone read cupcakes yet
<Dashee> cachi01|phone awesome, i'm a lvl 55 khajiit
<cachi01|phone> Everypony has
<Wrek> 05"please no star trek tomorrow"
<Vivix> Ooh, I might have to try th steed stone
<Wrek> 05maybe rewording would be in order
<andy> i stay away from cupcakes
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: if there is one skill in skyrim you should alway take, it's smithing. left branch is light, right branch heavy armor. choose one. you can find mats to skill them all over the place and there are vids on how to find mines with the required ores everywhere
<cachi01|phone> Dashee lvl 81 nord :3
<otakon> Smithing and Enchanting
<Vivix> Okay, I'll do that- I needed something more to do anyway, stopped main questline
<otakon> good ones to use
<CCCP> otakon hai!
<Dark_Horst> i have yet to see an armor that comes even close in protection value to what you can smithe yourself
<Dashee> cool, so 81 is max lvl?
<otakon> hiya CCCP
<cachi01|phone> Eeyup
<otakon> Dashee: eeyup
<otakon> 80 level ups
<Alchemist> yep, smithing and enchanting is a must
<andy> lol doctor is soo calm about his final messages
<otakon> I also suggest Sneak
<Wrek> 05i was sad to hear the DLC would be console only
<Michael> hai otakon
<Wrek> 05i hope that has changed now though
<cachi01|phone> But only like 50 skill points
<Vivix> Dawnguard?
<Wrek> 05would loooove crossbows
<Vivix> Dawnguard is out on PC now
<Dken2021> ugh, all this talk of skyrim just makes me want to play it, but my laptop sucks with PC games
<Wrek> 05nice
<Vivix> it came out--last week
<Wrek> 05ill pic kthat up once i get some cash
<Vivix> I would buy it, but with my current net--
<Dark_Horst> on my first paythrough, i did a lightly armored sneak archer. sneak attack EVERYTHING
<Vivix> 0.6mbps boys- it's horrible
<Alchemist> I picked up sneak and archery too, but that became OP very quickly :D
<Dark_Horst> that was fun, indeed
<andy> sneak attacks are best attacks
<Wrek> 05you have my condolences Vivix
<Vivix> it is very OP, but hella fun
<cachi01|phone> Magicka FTW
<Everlasting_Joy> "We're not dead yet, and we're not ready to die."
<Vivix> hehehe, we hope to get better net with wireless netcom-
<Everlasting_Joy> Vivix: :(
<Vivix> We used to have 16mbps, but then we moved
<cachi01|phone> am i the only one here with master.destruction spells?
<Alchemist> now Im a one hander (sword) with some destruction and blocking skills on the side.
*Michael has master spells
<Dark_Horst> current playthrough is a greatsword brawler. heavy armor of course
<Underpony> Be back later, testing
<Dashee> I have 99 Archery, i only use my bow
<Vivix> I am light armor, small axe and stealth+bow
<Dark_Horst> it's fun to jsut hack everything to pieces, but it can get dull sometimes
<Underpony> Be back later, testing
<Alchemist> quite challenging to take out dragons with a sword
<Underpony> Be back later, testing
<Flyboy> erm... thats a lot of desktop ponies...
<Underpony> Be back later, testing
<cachi01|phone> Michael which is ur fave? Mine is the one that looks like a kamehameha lol
<Underpony> Be back later, testing
<Dken2021> Flyboy not as much as 109
<Flyboy> wrek's oc has a hell of a job to do on that painting
<Underpony> Be back later, testing
<MegaMoonShine> I think Underpony is testing... :S
<Underpony> Be back later, testing
<Michael> cachi01|phone: the fire spell is quite good in dungeons
<Underpony> Be back later, testing
<Vivix> Yol Tol?
<Dark_Horst> the most fun i had was when i discovered that you can slit throats when you sneakattack someone with a one-handed sword from behind
<cachi01|phone> Or when surrounded also
<Vivix> ohh, I have to try that
<Alchemist> until you get 100 at enchanting and put 2 destructive enchantments to your weapon with max damage, then proceed to upgrade it to legendary and you are OP again :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man lol all this talk of skyrim makes me want it >.< though i have to get my ps3 repaired first sigh 100$ down the drain for that :$
<Vivix> Aww
<Vivix> I prefer it on computer, since it's a bethesda game
<Everlasting_Joy> Goat noise in the background.
<otakon> I almost NEVER get sneak kill animations
<Vivix> when a bug hits me, dev console power!
<Wrek> 05elder scrolls games are always better on PC
<otakon> even when I buff the damage
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: not sure if it requires any sneak-perks.... probabaly does. but i know it works with swords and daggers
<otakon> and so much lag!
<Michael> any1 here is gonna buy GW2?
<Wrek> 05almost purely casue of modding
<andy> skyrim is awesome for a while but it gets really repetitive
<otakon> GODDAMN YOU LAG!
<Vivix> ah yeah
<Vivix> and yeah, the mods make it worth it
<Striker> GW2?
<Vivix> I need horse mods, the ai and animations are--not to my liking
<Dashee> I only have a crappy laptop, I want a good gaming pc but can't afford it :(
<Vivix> that and the third person
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek, those Fluttershy dragons are proof of that.
<killerpony7733> Wrek: It a essence skyrim has a unlimited amount of hours almost due to the sheer amount of mods
<Vivix> I payed..
<cachi01|phone> Andy only when you finish all quests. And that takes its time
<killerpony7733> in*
<Michael> Striker: guild wars 2
<Striker> oh
<Chrysalis> zoom and enhance
<Vivix> 800 dollars for my PC, i7 3.2ghz and 16mb ram
<Vivix> old gcard, but it works
<otakon> so why don't they like the human?
<daring_derpy> gb?
<Chrysalis> 16mb ranm
<Alchemist> andy: I thought the same, then I gave up being obsessive-compulsive while clearing out caves and the problem got solved
<Chrysalis> thats tiny
<Saturn> 08,01inb4 ded
<cachi01|phone> PC Y U SO EXPENSIVE :(
<Vivix> well- In norway that's cheap
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: sandy or ivy?
<alexxm> he's infected
<Vivix> what now?
<andy> Alchemist: lol that might be my problem
<MadSurge> FUCK ME, I got scared by a fly's shadow that was gigantified by the lamp D:
<Michael> cachi01|phone: but funny to mount
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: the i7. sandy or ivy bridge?
<Dashee> lol
<Striker> I`m going to get a gaming laptop after I move out of my apartment
<BrokenCanary> What are we watching btw.
*cachi01|phone fucks madsurge
<Vivix> Oh, I don't know man- how do I check easily?
<cachi01|phone> You asked for it
<Vivix> I bought it last summer, so my memory is horrible
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: should say in the processor description
<Dashee> I was watching the Olympics the other day when a wasp landed on the camera lense, it scared me to death
<andy> a desktop might be a good choice of you want better performance
<andy> of*
<andy> if*
<Everlasting_Joy> Dashee: Holy crap!
<MegaMoonShine> lol Dashee
<Dashee> It looked huge lol
<Michael> dem wasps
<Saturn> 08,01and ded
<Vivix> i7 2600 3.4ghz-- I honestly can not remember what the shop said
<Michael> :(
<Vivix> but 2600 and not 2600K
<Saturn> 08,01i like hornets
<Saturn> 08,01they're like huge, docile wasps
<daring_derpy> it was full of explosives
<Buytoast> nope nope
<Alchemist> I get good perfomance on a 4 year old PC because I still own a 19" CRT monitor with a max res of 1280*1024 :D
<otakon> what's wrong with them?
<Buytoast> nope
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: oh well. those names are totally non-describing nowadays anyway
<otakon> Saturn: docile my ass
<CCCP> lol http://derpy.me/uAz5e
<Buytoast> no bee/wasp discussion
<Buytoast> nope
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<Vivix> 2600K is clocked, 2600 is underclocked? Ic an't remember
<Unnr|Laptop> otakon: compared to wasps?
<Everlasting_Joy> CCCP: Bob Ross is a boss.
<Dark_Horst> i miss the days when you could say "the numbers in this processors name are higher, it's the better model"
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: one guy on bronystate lost an eye to a wasp
<Michael> CCCP: happy flutertrees
<cachi01|phone> REMEMBER THE BIRDS AND THE BEES?
<Vivix> I never overclock and pay extra to have it not factory clocked
<CCCP> Everlasting_Joy ikr!
<otakon> Unnr|Laptop: yes compared to wasps
<cachi01|phone> I MADE YOU
<otakon> Hornets can kiss my as
<cachi01|phone> WELCOME
<Dark_Horst> but today intel seems to be obsessed with utterly confusing their customers
<otakon> ded
<CCCP> Michael haaha
<MegaMoonShine> *squee*
<Underpony> Sorry for that spam earlier, Xchat crashed. Not my fault.
<Zanon> lol somepony squeed
<Dashee> I love that noise :)
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: who?
<Vivix> i7 2600 3.4 was the top of the line back when I bought it, it'll last me a good..while
<Chrysalis> fluttersquee is bad timing
<andy> otakon: hornets kiss can hurt
<alexxm> perfect way to end that scene
<Vivix> I buy new computer every 5 years or so
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: have you ever handled one?
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: Blazeangel iirc
<Vivix> usually never pay a lot since I buy part by part
<otakon> Saturn: I've been stung by the bastards enough times for not doing anything
<andy> arent parts just as expensive as factory?
<Striker> I`m going to get an Alienware
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: 800 bucks you say? did you order it in parts?
<Everlasting_Joy> andy: Amazon my friend.
<Vivix> well kinda, but they're not charging for putting them together
<Vivix> yeah, parts
<Michael> dat is expensive Striker
<Spectrum_Rush> Shran
<andy> yay blue dude is back
<Vivix> and if I like.. NOW I need a new gcard, I can pay 200 dolalrs and be back on top
<Everlasting_Joy> Sonic boom!
<Vivix> then wait 2-3 years before I upgrade again
<Spectrum_Rush> Shran is a Bro
<cachi01|phone> I misread that to blue dude is black
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: where did you order?
<Striker> Thats why I`m going to get one a year after I move
<Vivix> Datakjeden
<andy> :D
<Vivix> norwegian store
<Dark_Horst> thx
<Buytoast> hey it's papa smurf
<Alchemist> Vivix: also you get the warranties individually for every part, while if they put it together for you and you open the case the warranty is void for everything
<Dashee> Destroy!
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: hornets or wasps?
<Vivix> yeah, you get all the individual warranties
<Vivix> which is very nice
<otakon> Saturn: both
<Dashee> That wasp was creepy as hell
<Striker> STAR WARS ALL OF THE SUDDEN
<Ryunosuke> yellowjackets sucks
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: well you must be really annoying to them, then
<cachi01|phone> Is there a bee fetish?
<Vivix> yesss
<otakon> Saturn: by walking by them?
<Underpony> oh
<Underpony> that's interesting
<andy> Alchemist: so if you buy factory opening the case will kill the warranty?
<Vivix> So, for anyone buying computer to--play games I suggest buying parts, and only what you need. It will last you much longer than a laptop, and save you money if you get help putting it together
<Everlasting_Joy> Vwomp!
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: i've handled hornets, and have not been stung
<Alchemist> andy: in my country it will, not sure about the rest of europe though
<Dark_Horst> hmmm... i might have a slight language problem ther
<Saturn> 08,01wouldn't even consider doing it with a wasp, thoguh
<otakon> Saturn: lucky you
<otakon> Saturn: bees don't bother me though
<Saturn> 08,01i've been stung by bees >.>
<Vivix> Dark_Horst: yeah, Datakjeden is norwegian, ships scandinavia, I'm sure there's stores more suited to you in your country
<Buytoast> so are the smurfs assholes or what's the deal with them?
<Dark_Horst> probably
<Chrysalis> reverse the polarity!
<Michael> i like bees
<Wrek> 05i was bitten by a bumble bee once
<Saturn> 08,01flox would be an awesome captain
<Dark_Horst> i know of alternate, but they arent the cheapest
<andy> turns rod around: changes colour to red
<Wrek> 05it was tuck between my foot and my shoe somehow
<otakon> Wrek: O_o?

<Buytoast> i once stomped their hive into pulp when i was a little kid
<Vivix> the thing with big pcs..eh whatevernameisinenglish, they last a really long time
<Dark_Horst> bumblebees sting, they dont bite
<Buytoast> about 40ish of them stung me
<Chrysalis> uh oh

<Wrek> 05Dark_Horst
<Buytoast> little bastards
<daring_derpy> spoiler: humans win
<Wrek> 05wahtever
<Vivix> and if you find yourself lagging on gcards, intead of new computer you just buy one part
<Striker> DAMN NATURE YOU SCARY!!
<Chrysalis> bye bye dylithium
<Buytoast> it was jidden in a rotting stump
<Saturn> 08,01Buytoast: well, that's your own damn fault then, isn't it?
<Buytoast> hidden
<Saturn> 08,01heh
<Everlasting_Joy> Wait wait wait! We're talking about bees and we haven't thrown Nic Cage in here?! I'm impressed :).
<Buytoast> those little bastards shouln't build their homes in stumps
<Buytoast> they're bees, not monkeys
<otakon> Does NO ONE have any type of armor in this show?
<Saturn> 08,01the first time i tended a beehive, i was really surprised by the warmth they generate
<otakon> ded
<Meanwhile> Armour is for pansies.
<Chrysalis> red shirt
<Saturn> 08,01i don't use gloves when working hives
<andy> dont need armor when you have lasers that can cut thtough metal
<otakon> Meanwhile: no armor is for people who don't want to die
<andy> either way your deaad
<cachi01|phone> And i misread that to armor is for penises
<Meanwhile> otakon: Pansies.
<Striker> that wierd dude is wearing shoulder pads
<Dark_Horst> otakon: the reptiles suits reflected energy weapons, but they found a way to counter that
<Spectrum_Rush> Saturn: you are a braver man then me
<otakon> Dark_Horst: ah
<otakon> inb4 it's not the last of them
<andy> well he is a wierd dude
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> say has anyone seen Game Grumps?

<Michael> game grumps?
<MegaMoonShine> They did it?
<Striker> SLENDER MEN!!!
<Saturn> 08,01Spectrum_Rush: using your bare hands makes you gentler with the hive
<Vivix> Saturn, when I was a kid I was seriously terrified by bees, I still jump aroundw hen I see them
<Buytoast> what about the Game Chumps? other than that they are garbage
<otakon> andy: it's from being in that dimension
<Saturn> 08,01so they don't generally sting you anyway
<andy> i see
<MegaMoonShine> YEEEEES! :O
<Vivix> most hive workes I've heard say that bees are nice- so yeah
<Michael> lol, that was a planet?
