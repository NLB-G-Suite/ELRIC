<Lunar_Brony> Quick_Thinker I don't get it
<Wrek> 05uhm
<Wrek> 05there is a reason we lock the main room and unlock the 6 side rooms durign episodes
<Wrek> 05so that the floodeffect is lessened
<Quick_Thinker> point taken
<JESmith71> Quick_Thinker that would only be during the episodes right? It'll be just like it is now the rest of the week

<FairysHuff> Morning ponies.

<Spell-of-Gaming> I feel really stupid for the current parents of this generation
<Soupor> isn't watching all of mlp 9 hours..?
*MASF123 asks a question
<sub06905> hm 19hrs of ponies
<CrimsonPhoenix> Soupor, not really
<MASF123> How do you motivate yourself to read?
<CrimsonPhoenix> 19 hours sounds about right
<Alpha-Omega> my little sister wins everyday then :D
*Spell-of-Gaming fastforwards all the episodes 10x
<Spell-of-Gaming> Problem solved.
<TheRandomkid321> I wish my TF2 was working
<MASF123> What's wrong with it?
<Sumica> 00,1020 ish if you take breaks for like food and such

<killerpony7733> Damn i crashed
<MASF123> So the computer doesn't recognise the shortcut as an application .exe file?
<TheRandomkid321> MASF123 it did yesterday
<CrimsonPhoenix> that little character was unnecessary
<CrimsonPhoenix> but yeah that's doable
<Waffles> challenge....accepted? sub06905
<Soupor> sub06905, i wonder if someone actually accomplished that, and did the extra points..
<CrimsonPhoenix> Soupor, many
<sub06905> and we are doing this over tinychat
<Spell-of-Gaming> If you haven't rewatched any episodes or watched pony promos from The Hub, you've watched 19 hours worth of official ponies
<Alpha-Omega> I can do that on ipad. I still have the website saved from where I originally watched MLP
<Waffles> nomtree<.<
<JRP2234[Web]> METROID
<CrimsonPhoenix> Alpha-Omega, is this it? http://mlp-fim.com/1
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's very "logical" for parents to blame siblings if one of them gets hurt. :I
<sub06905> either over Tinychat or Skype, not quite sure yet
<Alpha-Omega> nope I saw them all on dailymotion.com
<cratorkid> i used netflix
<MASF123> TheRandomkid321 hav you checked on a forum to help with your problem
<TheRandomkid321> I've searched the forums and found nothing
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh, your baby brother slipped?! I BLAME IT ON YOU.
<sub06905> this game looks fun
<cratorkid> it is
<Alpha-Omega> can you aim?
<cratorkid> ye
<cratorkid> yes
<FairysHuff> Its hard though
<Jmo4267> Yawn.
<JRP2234[Web]> metroid
<JRP2234[Web]> prime
<JRP2234[Web]> gamecube
<JRP2234[Web]> 2002
<Soupor> isnt this game free..?
<Alpha-Omega> yes
<FairysHuff> It is free.
<sub06905> might get this game
<Spell-of-Gaming> I wish my hardware can handle this. :c It looks seriously fun.
<FairysHuff> Though it takes lots of practice to get good at so don't expect a pick up and play experience.
<sub06905> just hope laptop can handle this
<MASF123> TheRandomkid321, did you try uninstalling it and re-installing it, restarting your omputer?
<killerpony7733> Spell-of-Gaming: I had a gaming ish laptop from around 2009, And it handles the game more then well
<killerpony7733> TheRandomkid321: Would you be talking about tribes?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I haven't even got my hardware upgraded even once. :c
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm planning to save money if I want to upgrade. :c
*FairysHuff hugs killerpony7733
<sub06905> dont think a Intel HD 3000 will handle this game
*killerpony7733 hugs back FairysHuff
<Spell-of-Gaming> Intel is really... crappy
<killerpony7733> hiya
<TheRandomkid321> MASF123 I rstarded my computer last night before bed. That may have caused it. And I aint currently got a spare 12 hours to reinstall TF2 any time soon.
<Alpha-Omega> I'm planning to ask my parents for an alienware laptop for my 18th birthday
<Jmo4267> ROFL^
<Jmo4267> Please tell me you're joking.
<Alpha-Omega> nope not even in the least
<TheRandomkid321> Alienware is all fancy but not all that good
<FairysHuff> Alpha-Omega: Don't bother. Their over priced. You can get a gaming laptop with the same specs for cheaper since it wont be a brand name.
<Jmo4267> Alienware are a joke.
<killerpony7733> ^This
<sub06905> I'm surprised my Intel graphics card can handle GTA 4 and Skyrim quite nice :D
<Jmo4267> They're good style and all, but not worth the price.
<Jmo4267> You could get a better computer for less.
<killerpony7733> ^^^^^
<Waffles> true
<Alpha-Omega> Alright then I will look into it
<Jmo4267> You better.
<Alpha-Omega> :S
<sub06905> lol
<Jmo4267> :D
<Jmo4267> I mean alienware has great design and looks and all that..but it isn't worth the dosh. Their specifications aren't that great.
<Alpha-Omega> it better have a quad core processor then
<killerpony7733> My laptop has a quad core
<killerpony7733> I believe
<Jmo4267> It's like Nike vs a generic brand.
<FairysHuff> Mines has an i7 whatever that is.
<sub06905> hmmm might browse around Newegg for a computer
<Jmo4267> Just cause it has Nike on it, they'll charge alot.
<Alpha-Omega> understood
<Jmo4267> Meanwhile the generic brand is the same, without the logo.
<Jmo4267> I mean, I'm not a fan of laptops but I thought I should throw that in.
<killerpony7733> Jmo4267: yeah though there is known brands worth buying due to how the make something, But overpriced as hell brands god no
<Jmo4267> Desktop all the way :$
<sub06905> ^^^
<killerpony7733> they*
<Alpha-Omega> in fact I might start dto research right now
<Jmo4267> If you could fully customise a laptop, I would be fine with one
<Jmo4267> But you can't really :(
<sub06905> hmm either buy a gaming computer or build one
<Jmo4267> Sometimes you can change the CPU/GPU, but it depends on the design.
<FairysHuff> I find Toshiba to be a great make. Never had any problems with their high end laptops.
<Alpha-Omega> dell let's you
<Jmo4267> RAM/HDD you can change fine.
<Jmo4267> Only laptop I've ever owned was Toshiba, and that lasted 4 or so years.
<Jmo4267> Lasted its time.
<FairysHuff> Yup. Well made.
<Alpha-Omega> eh toshiba
<sub06905> im currently on a Samsung laptop
<FairysHuff> Samsung are good to.
<Jmo4267> ^
<Alpha-Omega> I'm on ipad
<cratorkid> i prefer building my own , you get what you pay for
<Jmo4267> I have too much Samsung stuff in my room.
<Jmo4267> And I'm not even gonna get into Apple. ;-;
<sub06905> :D
<cratorkid> i HATE apple
<Jmo4267> Android or gtfo.
<Alpha-Omega> same here I still kind of don't like them
<killerpony7733> Jmo4267: Wanna know the most funny?, The most durable of the iphones is the 1st gen
<Jmo4267> I know.
<FairysHuff> cratorkid: I used to do that but after building 4 of them I got bored of all the time and energy it took to build one. As well as research all the tech.
<Alpha-Omega> I love android operating systems
<Jmo4267> It is sad and funny at the same time.
<killerpony7733> The others break like a match stick
<Jmo4267> Android is great for their open API and customisable interface.
<sub06905> Apple can build a nice looking computer
<killerpony7733> drop it?, glass breaks
<Jmo4267> An example is the OUYA console, that thing is gonna be mental.
<Jmo4267> Open API Android console.
<Jmo4267> The possibilities will be endless.
<Alpha-Omega> yeah the jailbreaker are able to po android to ios devices
<Alpha-Omega> port
<cratorkid> FairysHuff: yea i can understand that , when i upgrade tho its more often with less parts then doing an overhaul each time i upgrade
<FairysHuff> cratorkid: I just don't have the patience for it anymore ^_^
*sub06905 still needs to beat Half-life 2
<Jmo4267> Tsk tsk FairysHuff.
<Jmo4267> Disappoint :P
<FairysHuff> *Shrugs* It is what it is ^_^
<Jmo4267> Indeed :)
<cratorkid> FairysHuff: yea. im not bothered by the timew tho , this way i dont pay 1000 dollars for a pc thats worth 400. with the right parts and overclocking you can turn an 800 pc into a 1000
<Jmo4267> ^
<Jmo4267> That is exactly right.
<Jmo4267> There are several examples that could be thrown in, but I'm too lazy at the moment.
<Jmo4267> There are several factors that it won't be applied though.
<FairysHuff> cratorkid: True but theres also portability issue. You can't take a desktop or tower unit on holiday with you ^_^
<Sabershy> Alright everypony! Good night and have a nice dream/day!
<Jmo4267> Goodnight Sabershy.
<FairysHuff> Night Sabershy
<Alpha-Omega> I think I'm going for the asus g74sx
<Jmo4267> The ASUS G Series is decent.
<sub06905> nite Sabershy
<Jmo4267> Seen several reviews on different ones.
<FairysHuff> I have an ASUS TF201
<Jmo4267> Dunno so much about the prices though.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Team Fortress 201? :P
<Alpha-Omega> it's 1600
<Jmo4267> Not too bad.
<Alpha-Omega> $1600
<Jmo4267> This is totally Team Fortress 201 :D
<FairysHuff> http://uk.asus.com/Eee/Eee_Pad/Eee_Pad_Transformer_Prime_TF201/
<cratorkid> here is a case from IBUYPOWER i recomend you dont use them, but this is an example of a portable case http://techngear.com/ibuypower-lan-warrior-ii-gaming-rigs-new-colors.html FairysHuff
<Alpha-Omega> Well the only reason I want a gaming laptop is mostly for college and I LOVE graphical power and speed
<FairysHuff> And a high end Toshiba Satellite Pro gaming laptop.
<killerpony7733> Damn wreks game is full
<Jmo4267> Toshiba have always made their Satellite laptops great.
<FairysHuff> Alpha-Omega: You may not want to get a gaming laptop if your going to college. It will only distract you from studies.
<Jmo4267> ^
<Malavolent> Ello there everypony.
<FairysHuff> Ello Malavolent
<Jmo4267> Hello Malavolent
<Alpha-Omega> To be honest I'm kind of a work first fun later person
<FairysHuff> Alpha-Omega: Lucky. I'm a huge procrastinator ^_^ Can't help it.
<cratorkid> IMHO i hate apple but they are good for work
<cratorkid> at timed
<cratorkid> times
<Spell-of-Gaming> I can't help but procrastinate every. single. day.
<cratorkid> ^
<Jmo4267> Haha.
<Alpha-Omega> Well of course I have a list of what matters first
<FairysHuff> porn?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I've angered my parents hundreds of times because of it.
<cratorkid> thats procraterbation not procratinationg
<FairysHuff> Roll on cybernetic implants for the human brain so we can stem our procrastination ^_^
<cratorkid> ^
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'd actually appreaciate school more if there was only few homework and the learning system is FUN.
<Jmo4267> ^^^^^^^^
<Jmo4267> The learning system is horrible
<Jmo4267> Makes me cry.
<Alpha-Omega> Also I'm most likely going into a field in computers
<Spell-of-Gaming> Reenactment of school in TV: Fun. School in real life: I think I want to cry.
<Jmo4267> ^
*sub06905 is getting bored of video games
<FairysHuff> sub06905: Try rock climbing, archery or Harp. Thats what I do
<Jmo4267> I'll be back in like..20 minutes or so, gotta go twinker something. Love you all :$
<sub06905> i am thinking of getting back into playing Piano
<FairysHuff> sub06905: why dont you?
<sub06905> FairysHuff: i dont have a piano or keyboard
<sub06905> hoping to get one for birthday
<Spell-of-Gaming> I like music, until the learning system made it confusing
<FairysHuff> You can get a keyboard much cheaper than you can a harp.
<sub06905> ded
<Alpha-Omega> alright best buy has the computer for $300 dollars less
<FairysHuff> £80 for a Keyboard, £2000 minimum for a harp.
<sub06905> Alpha-Omega: which computer?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I wonder how many people in my country go in to the gaming industry.
<Malavolent> FairysHuff: You picked bad instrument to play :D
<cratorkid> Alpha-Omega: you realy should just build your own
<FairysHuff> A penis survey computer
<Spell-of-Gaming> There's a lot of avid gamers here, but the only shit they play are MMORPGs and FPS
<FairysHuff> cratorkid: Build my own harp? O_o Are you crazy! I'm no artisan.
<sub06905> :D
<Alpha-Omega> trust me if I build my own computer it would cost well over $200 dollars
<cratorkid> FairysHuff: lol
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh, and Facebook games. :I
<Alpha-Omega> 2000
<cratorkid> Spell-of-Gaming: not true i dont play either
<Wrek> 05talking ab out me are ya Spell-of-Gaming?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Wrek: Nope.
<Spell-of-Gaming> My country.
<sub06905> Play farmville all day :D
<Alpha-Omega> ggggrrrrrr facebook games are stupid and pointless
<sub06905> ^^^
<cratorkid> Spell-of-Gaming: im mostly RPGs and i dont count most valve games to be fps , they are above that tag thats been hamed by COD
<Spell-of-Gaming> Believe me, you don't want to know how much I've cried when I saw that my classmates have expensive computers and they play mostly Facebook games while I have a crappy one and it can't run Dungeon Defenders on a fast framerate.
<sub06905> :D
<FairysHuff> Spell-of-Gaming: Why not just kill your classmates?
<Malavolent> I used to think that investing money to upgrade computer to play better games was worth it.
<Spell-of-Gaming> They've learned about Steam now though.
<Malavolent> I guess you grow out of it eventually.
<sub06905> pay $2000 for a gaming computer, then play nothing but crappy mmos and Facebook game
<sub06905> games*
<FairysHuff> Thats kids for yah
<cratorkid> ^
<Spell-of-Gaming> BTW, I'm 11 :3
<Alpha-Omega> My friend told me about steam about a month ago and plus I'm a recent convert to pc gaming
<sub06905> orly Spell-of-Gaming?
<Spell-of-Gaming> sub06905: I'm not even kidding.
<FairysHuff> sub06905: Down boy.
<cratorkid> buy $2000 pc , play WoW all day
<sub06905> FairysHuff: ?
<FairysHuff> Just teasing
<sub06905> :3
<cratorkid> Spell-of-Gaming: be carefull with your age around here
<cratorkid> Spell-of-Gaming: need to be atleast 13 to be on without supervision
<FairysHuff> Yeh cause sub06905 is a 65 year old tranvestite pedophile.

<Waffles> i wasnt there for the wedding episode :'(
<sub06905> i wasent here for any of them D:
<Alpha-Omega> ^
<FairysHuff> I wonder if we get a BronyState goody bag when season 3 starts.
<Waffles> like, a party?
<FairysHuff> Or a convention
<Spell-of-Gaming> For a Bronystate goody bag, you need Bronystate membership.
*Jmo4267 flips a table
<XAX> ^
<Jmo4267> BOLLOCKS TO THAT.
<alexxm> is this game good looks fast paced
<sub06905> In Season 3 there will be [Censored By Bronystate]
<alexxm> boo
<Alpha-Omega> :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> I think the Bronystate shop is gonna open in April 2013
<FairysHuff> I believe there will be BronyState adult toys at some point. *Cough*
<Malavolent> Did you know: The first episode of Season 3 will be aired [You need Bronystate Gold Account to read this message]
<Alpha-Omega> cool I would love a shirt
<alexxm> not again
<Spell-of-Gaming> If you pre-order membership, you'll receive the Season 3 goody bgag.
<Spell-of-Gaming> ((the bronystate shop is not serious, okay? :3))
<FairysHuff> If you don't pre-order you get a kick to teh teeth
<Alpha-Omega> Doen't stop me I still want a shirt
<Alpha-Omega> foesn't
<Alpha-Omega> fuuuuu
<Waffles> derp
<sub06905> ill make my own bronystate shirt :$
<Malavolent> I wonder if they sell brony t-shirts in my country.
<FairysHuff> I know they sell children... I mean... eh... someone told me that >_>
<Spell-of-Gaming> If you want a huge Season 3 goody bag, you need to bring the best pony to the store. :3
<Waffles> twilight?
<sub06905> Twilight Sparkle?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I guess you need to bring everypony
<Waffles> :)
*Alpha-Omega rolls eyes
<FairysHuff> Everypony combines to form ultra megazord robot pony.
<Malavolent> Transformers 4.
<alexxm> that would be awesome
<Alpha-Omega> if they we fused how did a robot get in?
<FairysHuff> It was an android phone
<Spell-of-Gaming> I would love to see a joke tab saying "Shop" in the menus above on April 1 next year.
<Alpha-Omega> that would be awesome :D
<Alpha-Omega> ...
<Spell-of-Gaming> And if you click the tab, it should show the image on Megaupload when it was closed but Bronystate-style
<Spell-of-Gaming> Teh chat is quiet :3
<Alpha-Omega> avast fluttershy's ass remix
<FairysHuff> Fluttershys arse is best arse.
<Waffles> i want brushie song
<alexxm> why was it even called avast fluttershys ass
<Alpha-Omega> I have no clue
<Waffles> .....6_9
<Alpha-Omega> for the lols?
<FairysHuff> Cause its best arse
<Spell-of-Gaming> Avast X's Ass is a meme :P
<Malavolent> Doest Fluttershy use ass extensions?
<XAX> The original song is "Avast your ass". Remixes replace the middle word with what sounds are being used to make a remix of the song.
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's dead right now
<FairysHuff> LIES!
<Alpha-Omega> no tail extensions
<XAX> Eg: look up Avast microsofts ass
<XAX> Wait no
<Malavolent> Avast Octavia's plot is still the best.
<XAX> Avast windows xp's ass
<Alpha-Omega> I love her hair though :3
<XAX> Malavolent: Avast windows xp's ass sounds sxc though
<FairysHuff> Think I'm gonna go play something or nap. Haven't decided. Later ponys.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm still afraid of that game where you open up Excel as a game.
<Alpha-Omega> Bye FairysHuff
<alexxm> bye FairysHuff
<Alpha-Omega> excel as a game booo
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's not an ordinary game
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's an easter egg by Microsoft
<Alpha-Omega> ...?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Just search it on Google or YouTube
<Alpha-Omega> ok
<Spell-of-Gaming> Don't tell me I warned you, though.
<alexxm> Spell-of-Gaming is it that hall of the damned thing
<Alpha-Omega> ....why warn?
<Spell-of-Gaming> alexxm: Yup
<Spell-of-Gaming> That crap still haunts me
<Waffles> brushie brushie brushie
<Waffles> brushie.
<Alpha-Omega> =.=
<Spell-of-Gaming> pushie pushie pushie
<Jmo4267> BRUSHIE!
<Spell-of-Gaming> pushie.
<Jmo4267> :'D
<Spell-of-Gaming> I think it's laughable that I procrastinate but I don't have anything to do
<Spell-of-Gaming> when procrastinating
<Spell-of-Gaming> There's nothing interesting in my life to watch, really.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Just daily struggles.
<Jmo4267> Watch paint dry.
<Jmo4267> It is very entertaining and enjoyable.
<Jmo4267> :D
<Waffles> i suck at paining
<Spell-of-Gaming> Twitter needs more trolls.
<Waffles> painting*
<Alpha-Omega> lame easter egg
<Spell-of-Gaming> I guess it's time to check Reddit. :I
<Alpha-Omega> i like zeg rush on google better
<Alpha-Omega> zerg
<alexxm> Alpha-Omega have you searched do a barrel roll
*sub06905 enjoys watching paint dry
<Alpha-Omega> yup
<Jmo4267> Reddit.
*Jmo4267 shivers
<Spell-of-Gaming> Doing a barrel roll at the same time with zerg rush on Google at the same time might be... interesting
<alexxm> Spell-of-Gaming can't you only do stuff like that one at a time
<TheRandomkid321> all i needed to do was restart my computer.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Reddit isn't all that bad until you discover the fucked up subreddits
<alexxm> like what
<Alpha-Omega> I don't want to know
<Jmo4267> Rofl.
<TheRandomkid321> I once saw a clop-clop reddit.
<Spell-of-Gaming> That exists. :I
<Alpha-Omega> I'm serious =.=
<Jmo4267> Burn it with fire.
<TheRandomkid321> Sub redit actually I think.
<TheRandomkid321> Buut yes
<Spell-of-Gaming> I usually visit /r/aww on a regular basis

<Jmo4267> I hope you go outside on a regular basis too. :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> I can't right now, really
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's raining cats and dogs
<TheRandomkid321> I am allergic to sunlight
<sub06905> dat pinkie :3
<Alpha-Omega> I live in ghetto apartments. I don't want to go outside
<Jmo4267> >_>
<Jmo4267> How long did it take for you guys to cook up those excuses.
<TheRandomkid321> Alpha-Omega do you have a gun for protection?
<BronyInstrumentl|art> i live in the ghetto. the outside world scares me
<Alpha-Omega> no
<sub06905> i go outside when i feel like it
<Spell-of-Gaming> I can send you a picture of outside if you want. :3
<TheRandomkid321> Jmo4267 I have been using the allergic to sun excuse for months
<Jmo4267> I bet you have.
<Alpha-Omega> XD
<Jmo4267> :D
<Alpha-Omega> Also there's nothing interesting in my town except the mall
<sub06905> ^
<Alpha-Omega> or big splash and the theater
<TheRandomkid321> Alpha-Omega Small town?
<BronyInstrumentl|art> even the mall isnt interesting to me and i live in the second biggest city in england >.>
<Waffles> this world is pail, it nees a little color
<Waffles> :D<
<Alpha-Omega> No it's just lame to live here
<sub06905> if i go to the mall i usally buy pony shirts :3
<TheRandomkid321> If I go outside I am usually forced to (school etc) but otherwise I am scouting for locations to film youtube videos... taht I one day will get around to making... I'm waiting for my voice to 100% mature
<Alpha-Omega> That's the problem I haven't been to the mall in forever. Parents are always busy
<Spell-of-Gaming> If books took you to a place, I would read them just to mess up the timeline
<sub06905> ^
<Alpha-Omega> :D
<XAX> "sub06905: if i go to the mall i usally buy pony shirts :3"
<TheRandomkid321> ^^&
<Waffles> the only pony t-shirt from my mall is just says "BRONY" and has rainbow dash
<TheRandomkid321> ^^^
<XAX> I want to live somewhere that you can buy pony shirts at a mall.

<TheRandomkid321> I have never seen a pony shirt in my town. Then again I am a closet brony.
<Alpha-Omega> you could always use the internet
<sub06905> man but a brony belt was quite expenisve
<Spell-of-Gaming> I would read Pokemon books to visit the fwuffy animals, though. :3
<XAX> Mutterguy, have you ever seen a poni shirt at any of the malls in chch?
<Alpha-Omega> I would go to Equestria
<TheRandomkid321> Spell-of-Gaming and try fried pikachu right? Just me who wants to do that?
<XAX> Spell-of-Gaming: Read the Pokemon manga. It's awesome.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I don't think eating mouse is healthy
<Alpha-Omega> dang I want to play Ponymon

<Chrysalis> g'morning everyone
<Spell-of-Gaming> ohai Chrysalis
<sub06905> ello Chrysalis
<Waffles> morning Chrysalis
<TheRandomkid321> Mornigh Deek!
<TheRandomkid321> I call people Deek ebcause it sound like d*** kinda
<sub06905> Spell-of-Gaming: dem cars
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> morning Chrysalis
<TheRandomkid321> It looks like a place you would stay indoors at.
<Chrysalis> how is everyone this morning
<Jmo4267> Hello Chrysalis! :)
<sub06905> im good Chrysalis, you?
<alexxm> i'm good Chrysalis how about you
<Chrysalis> im pretty good
<Chrysalis> bit warm, damn weather
<PuddingCupz> Back guys what is playing
<Jmo4267> Wanna trade with my cold weather?
*sub06905 wants rainy weather
<Waffles> i have sooo much Erros
<Chrysalis> id still be warm, computers rendering atm, really chugs out heat
<Jmo4267> What format/quality you rendering?
<Chrysalis> just rendering fraps to something thatll go onto youtube
<Jmo4267> Fair enough.
<Chrysalis> recorded the l4d game last night, so getting it ready to upload
<Jmo4267> Good 'ol L4D.
<alexxm> shazbot
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> ...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i miss my old pony theme and wallpapers ....
<MegaMoonShine> Morning everypony :)
<Jmo4267> Hey MegaMoonShine! :D
<sub06905> why does my laptop struggle with minecraft, but runs L4D perfectly ._.
<alexxm> how you doing MegaMoonShine
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai MegaMoonShine
<sub06905> ello MegaMoonShine
<Jmo4267> Maybe due to the fact Minecraft doesn't require a great computer?
*MegaMoonShine waves to Jmo4267 alexxm TheGreatAndPowerfulT and sub06905
<Waffles> hey MegaMoonShine
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sub06905 big world is harder to handle than a pre loaded lvl
*MegaMoonShine and Waffles
<Waffles> teehee
<sub06905> sounds reasonable
<Jmo4267> If you looked at the minecraft file itself and the saves it makes, they're small as chips, meanwhile L4D renders and generates alot of data therefore requiring quite abit of a computer.
<Jmo4267> Plus L4D isn't blocks ;D
<sub06905> lol
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<killerpony7733> Is anyone besides me playing with wrek in tribes? 6_9
<Jmo4267> Chat is derping up. QQ
<Jmo4267> Damn emoticons wouldn't show up.
<Waffles> i just left KILLERPONY7733
<Waffles> my tab aint working
<Waffles> wtf T^T
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Jmo4267 you get the problem wrong, he is saying he can run l4d without problem but minecraft is not working correctly
<sub06905> i highly doubt my Laptop will handle this game
<Jmo4267> Oh I read it wrong.
<Jmo4267> Thought it was the other way around.
<Jmo4267> Your java version might be out-dated or some of your minecraft data is corrupted.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sub06905 dunno try updating your drivers or java
<Jmo4267> If you're running a texture pack or mods that'll also throw more process onto it.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> .....
*Alpha-Omega-Prime Thinks he's done here
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> uhhh 7 hours to redownload tf2
<Mutterguy> oh dear lord who gave Ditzy Omnipotence on the minecraft server?
<Waffles> she didnt know what went wrong6_9
<TheRandomkid321> Speakin of MC is 1.3 out yet?
<Jmo4267> Nope.
<TheRandomkid321> Oh thank buck

<TheRandomkid321> I heare somehwere taht it was and if it was my MC is broken
<Chrysalis> 1.3 is in pre-release atm
<Chrysalis> it should be out soon
<Chrysalis> and then all the mods break :(
<Jmo4267> ^

<Waffles> strange
<MegaMoonShine> oni_link: Awesome! :$
<oni_link> MegaMoonShine: Im bummed out cause it didn't get to see that awesome movie with y'all. At least you liked it though. I have that movie on DVD :D
<oni_link> Also, what game is this?
<MegaMoonShine> oni_link: Which one? :S
<MegaMoonShine> oni_link: This game is called Tribes: Ascend
<oni_link> MegaMoonShine: The A movie for the last movie night? :P
<oni_link> and this game looks awesome :)
<MegaMoonShine> oni_link: Yeah, that was a great movie
<MegaMoonShine> Same with B movie too. That was one of my favourites as a kid
<derpy_pony> I fell asleep during the B movie :(
<derpy_pony> too late
<oni_link> Ohhh I can't wait until I get to get a PC alredy.
<oni_link> MegaMoonShine: I wanted to see the B movie soo bad :(
<sub06905> We are the Cutie Mark CrusadersOn a quest to find out who we areAnd we will never stop the journeyNot until we have our cutie marks
<MegaMoonShine> I had to go do something, and I missed the ending of the first movie and the first episode :(
<oni_link> MegaMoonShine: aw that sucks. Im psyched for tomorrow or later today I should say :D
<MegaMoonShine> Does anyone know this song btw? I've heard it before somewhere?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm back i remember i can't/know/want to cook so i have lucky charms
<oni_link> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Its the breakfast of ponies :P
<TheRandomkid321> oni_links what about apple jacks?
<MegaMoonShine> Lucky Charms, huh? The cereal with loads of Rarity! :D
<oni_link> TheRandomkid321: I think Apple Jacks only covers a certain portion lol Lucky Charms are Magic and oates :D
<oni_link> IKR MegaMoonShine
<oni_link> also I want my MPG :D
<oni_link> This looks like UT on crack , me gusta :3
<Jmo4267> ^Best description ever.
<oni_link> lol thats what it looks like :D
<Jmo4267> Indeed it does.
<oni_link> Is this F2P?
<Jmo4267> Yeah it is.
<Jmo4267> With microtransactions too..
<oni_link> So many games I gotta play when I get my PC
<oni_link> this one is on the list now :D
<Jmo4267> :P
<oni_link> And microtransactions you said? how do these affect the game?
<Malavolent> Kill them, Wrek. Kill them all.
<Jmo4267> Uh, from what I've seen it is like xp boosts and such.
<oni_link> My weakness ^ ^ ^ D:
<Malavolent> What are you talking about?
<Jmo4267> For example; Perfect for new players, the Steam Starter Pack includes: A lifetime 50% XP Boost, 4 Bonus Weapons for base classes, 2 class unlocks, 4 Perks, and 800 Tribes Gold.
<oni_link> Hmm, this is verry appealing :)
<oni_link> The gold is for said transactions Im guessing right?
<Jmo4267> Yep.
<Jmo4267> 800 Tribes Gold: Customize your experience in Tribes with 800 Tribes Gold. Buy cosmetic skins, additional weapons, experience boosts, and more!
<Jmo4267> (Source of this information is off Steam)
<oni_link> Jeez, I have to wait two months though. Having bills sucks, I have little to no money left for myself nowadays
<Jmo4267> Oh bills, how fun.
<oni_link> And Im either getting an M17x or a really badass desktop when those two months are up :) ( that is, if everything goes according to plan)
<Jmo4267> Alienware laptop.
*Jmo4267 flips oni_link
<oni_link> lwhy you flippin me Jmo4267? D:
<Jmo4267> Build a custom desktop.
<Jmo4267> Don't even bother with Alienware.
<Jmo4267> If you wanted specifically a laptop, get a different brand such as Toshiba or Asus.
<Jmo4267> Or something.
<Jmo4267> Cheaper and alot better specifications.
<the_real_pony_1604> asus republic of gamers stuff is far better than alienware
<oni_link> Jmo4267: I've been looking around fot laptops and for the display, Alienware is the best... but a Desktop isnt out of the question. I had this setup that would cost me about 1600 USD and I would be able to run just about anything on Max Setting (which is what Im after)
<Jmo4267> Several factors you have to put in place, 1. Do you want this laptop/desktop to last you along time? 2. Are you wanting to upgrade it later on or get a new computer?
<oni_link> the_real_pony_1604: G73s are nice too, I just haven't been keeping up with Asus lately.
<oni_link> Jmo4267: I plan on keeping it for a good while and upgrading if necessary
<Jmo4267> Is portability absolutely needed? Or just essential?
<oni_link> Jmo4267: I was considering getting a laptop and desktop replacement because this laptop I have is good only for browsing and maybe some music stuff.
<the_real_pony_1604> I am currently on 4.5 years on my current build, and if you build with a really good mobo they last for a long time. all the systems I build for myself and friends are with asus mobos
<oni_link> the_real_pony_1604: thats fairly long :P
<Jmo4267> I'd go with the desktop option, with $1600 you could build a great system.
<XAX> I had my old desktop for 8 years before getting a new one
<the_real_pony_1604> my laptop is currently a macbook pro with windows 7 installed on it
<XAX> I was happy with it the whole time
<Jmo4267> Ew Macbook.
<oni_link> the_real_pony_1604: mine too :D
<XAX> Hey that's not actually a bad idea. Seeing some MacBooks are bloody tiny compared to regular laptops, installing windows on one sounds like a plan.
<the_real_pony_1604> I used to feel the same way about macs, but i was forced into them because of work. and it is hard to quetion the hardware they use
<oni_link> Jmo4267: Both options are nice, but I feel like I would't be as happy if I had a desktop because of it being confined to one spot.
<Jmo4267> Then go with a decent laptop, just not Alienware.
<Jmo4267> You get Alienware and I'll hunt you down :(
<XAX> oni_link: That's a good point. I'm still extremely happy with my desktop I got in February. But it sucks how im confined to one spot.
<Jmo4267> Macbooks have a decent design/architecture but it's just the fact that it is Apple.
<Jmo4267> I despise the brand.
<the_real_pony_1604> alienware, when it was its own company back in the 90s was the best thing you could get. now that they are just glorified dell computers they are not the same
<LightTrooper105> hello everypony
<Jmo4267> Some things they're more beneficial in then laptops, but still.
<Jmo4267> Hello LightTrooper105
*LightTrooper105 give Jmo4267 muffin
*Jmo4267 noms muffin
<Jmo4267> I'd say go with an Asus G Series laptop, reasonably priced and great specifications if you get the right one.
<Jmo4267> But it is completely up to you.
<Jmo4267> Just throwing my two cents in.
<oni_link> XAX: In regards to Windows on Mac, Its awesome. But Im on an older Macbook. I have the 08 model with 256MB of vid memory and this one heats up more than I feel it should. If you got a new one, Im sure the experience would be amazing. At the same time, you'd have to re-learn shortcuts.
<XAX> yay intelligent conversation
<Jmo4267> ^
<the_real_pony_1604> my only knock on asus laptops, I work with a lady that I talked into getting a republic of gamers laptopl. the power port failed on it and she needed to get a new mobo after 6 months. and from what she found out is was pretty common for that model
<oni_link> Jmo4267: Well you are providing good points and helping to make an informed descision, so you are helping alot with this. But Im just stuck because it comes down to portability or power and i cant choose between the two at the moment :D
<Jmo4267> There is always flaws with something.
<LightTrooper105> nothing is perfect
<Jmo4267> Exactly.
<Jmo4267> Toshiba Satellite laptops are well built as well.
<the_real_pony_1604> my macbook is just a 13inch with the i5, 8gigs of ran, and a 120gig ssd. but I like it
<Jmo4267> Had one of the old series and lasted me for 5~ years.
<Jmo4267> DAT RAN.
<oni_link> Jmo4267: They get relatively hot though from what I hear
<Jmo4267> They do.
<Jmo4267> I had to use a cooler-mat, but even that wouldn't cool it down fully.
<Jmo4267> Not sure about the new ones.
<the_real_pony_1604> the only reason I say that about the asus rog laptop is so he can do some research and avoid that particular one
<Jmo4267> Haven't touched a laptop since.
<oni_link> the_real_pony_1604: how are you for video memory though?
<Jmo4267> A SSD in a laptop is questionable tbh.
<therainbowvortex> hello every pony
<the_real_pony_1604> 512, and the ssd uses less power so I can get a longer battery life
<Jmo4267> Hello therainbowvortex
<Jmo4267> Yeah but the fact that the size is small.
<Jmo4267> If you're only using it for browsing and doing small things, then I guess it would work.
<therainbowvortex> i read my little dashie again it still makes me sad :'(
<oni_link> the_real_pony_1604: better than mine, thats for sure :P
<the_real_pony_1604> I swapped out the hdd, and got another hour of "youtube" time out of it
<Jmo4267> But if you're doing things such as playing games, producing alot of videos/etc. then SSD is out of the question.
<therainbowvortex> why why did it have to end like that :'(
<Jmo4267> I hope you've read the sequel.
<therainbowvortex> what squal
<Jmo4267> Lemme get the link for you.
<Jmo4267> I'm not 100% if it is the official sequel or not, but the authors seem to be the same.

<Chrysalis> american?
<prince-dari> English
<oni_link> Jmo4267: The newest evo was my second choice for a mobile as a matter of fact :)
<AdamTheDuck> prince-dari: School in a nutshell
<Mutterguy> Also the exchange rate isn't nearly as in their favour now as it was back then $NZ 3 to the pound at one point
<prince-dari> Work is reserved for the last month before exams
<prince-dari> That's enough time to do all you need to get good results
<MadSurge> prince-dari: I think last february's snowstorm is the most snow we ever had around these parts
<Jmo4267> oni_link Nice choice, HTC would be my 2nd next to Samsung.
<Chrysalis> yes, because thats a great learning mentality which let you actually learn stuff
<Chrysalis> so that if you go back to it you know it
<Jmo4267> Mutterguy NZ has it rough with the economy, I have several friends that live there and complain alot.
<oni_link> Jmo4267: hi hoof for similar tastes /)
<Chrysalis> rather than just forget it after the exam
<Jmo4267> oni_link Indeed! (\

<prince-dari> Alpha-Omega-Prime, well that's antisocial
<Jmo4267> I only have one person who texts me. /foreveralone
<oni_link> Jmo4267: The Nexus was my number 3 :D Its still a nice phone but the camera is a bit dated. Other than that, its a good device,especially since google always plays favorites with updates on their devices
<Jmo4267> My reason for getting it was for work, but this whole year I've been sick. So that plan hasn't turnt out grand.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Not really it's more experience than anything. I always call and text but not response from said friends. SO no point in cell phone

<FairysHuff> Phew *Wipes brow*
<oni_link> Jmo4267: And getting rid of those capacitive buttons was an awesome thing to do too, more screen space :)
<Jmo4267> Yep.
<Jmo4267> They tend to keep their devices quite customisable too oni_link
<FairysHuff> Thankyou every pony that helped out. I appreciate it.
<Jmo4267> Which is great.
<Jmo4267> Anytime FairysHuff
<oni_link> Jmo4267: Yeah, Stock Android is best OS
<Jmo4267> oni_link Indeed!
<XAX> FairysHuff: Why're you uninstalling mIRC? ._.
<FairysHuff> XAX, Cause it's not free.
<oni_link> So whats the benefit of using an IRC program?
<prince-dari> It is. :P
<XAX> Dari has the right idea.
<Jmo4267> oni_link, there are many benefits, but it is each to their own. Some of those benefits might not fit your taste.
<oni_link> Jmo4267: I always wanted to try it out, I never got a chance to
<Mutterguy> It doesn't crash as much as yourr browser
<Jmo4267> And I'm too lazy to list them.
<prince-dari> oni_link: Not being shit
<Jmo4267> Rofl^
<prince-dari> Main advantage of a proper IRC client
<oni_link> prince-dari: that alone is a good reason :D
<XAX> Mutterguy: As far as I can remember, mIRC has never crashed.
<prince-dari> MFW the online counter for my mIRC
<prince-dari> 12330 hours
<Jmo4267> ..Wow
<oni_link> I get flash fails all the time when Im on the website, so that woulnt be a bad thing to try
<Mutterguy> yeah see my point hold true
<Jmo4267> That's over two years.
<prince-dari> Or 513.75 days
<oni_link> and wow, congrats on that :D
<XAX> prince-dari: *claps*
<prince-dari> I leave it on all the time. <:
<FairysHuff> well xchat irc is a free program.
<Mutterguy> Your PC never sleep?
<prince-dari> mIRC is free too
<FairysHuff> no it's not.
<prince-dari> You just have to click through the window that pops up when the trial is over
<oni_link> which is the best IRC client and why?
<FairysHuff> it has a trial period and mines is almost up on mirc
<Jmo4267> Oh lord, take cover.
<oni_link> lol
<prince-dari> The trial period runs out, but you can still use it
<XAX> oni_link: Only ever used mIRC. I personally can't form an opinion on others.
<prince-dari> Similar to winrar
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> IRC?
<oni_link> XAX: but its been good to you right?
<XAX> prince-dari: Then there's also the option of finding a crack.
<prince-dari> Alpha-Omega-Prime: What you are currently on
<XAX> oni_link: Yeah.
<prince-dari> XAX, yeah I did that when I got bored of the screen at the start
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Ipad?

<oni_link> i might give it a try later on then.
<prince-dari> Alpha-Omega-Prime: Internet Relay chat
<Jmo4267> I've used mIRC myself, worked fine. Saw my problems.
<FairysHuff> I tried using it yesterday and mirc wouldn't let me message on to bronystate. It would come up message failed to send.
<Jmo4267> But I'm fine with the website IRC.

<AdamTheDuck> Best 10 seconds of my life after seeing Octavia on that episode xD
<oni_link> I can't choose. Why is it so hard?
<Jmo4267> This brings up a story actually. I once use to live on a farm in Narrogin. It was a late night and I had to use the bathroom, I kid you not I saw something on the wall in the dark. It was a spider the size of a bloody wheel.
<Jmo4267> Had to use a spade to kill it.
<Jmo4267> I kid you not.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> we need octvia emoticon
<Jmo4267> Fear Australia, fear it.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Octavia

<Jmo4267> Biggest spider I had ever seen in my life.
<IFDreebs> I actually have the game and some other stuffz.
<Jmo4267> I enjoy spiders. ;D
<Rarityisboss> guys they said on the stream last night that in season 3 there will only be 13 episodes
<IFDreebs> SHAZBOT :D
<prince-dari> If we had spiders that big I'd be trolling all the arachnophobes in our country so hard.
<Jmo4267> Haha.
<Jmo4267> Red-back spiders scare people so much though.
<oni_link> Rarityisboss: NO SPOILERS! *rolls a newspaper up and smacks you*

<Jmo4267> Oh that image.

<Cypresswolf> Saw on running across my kitchen floor while cooking dinner - Im terrbly afraid of those roaches at the best of times - I just got a big handful of napkins and picked it up by hand before it could get away
<Mutterguy> Jmo4267 zerg rush!!
<Jmo4267> Yes and no oni_link
<Jmo4267> ZERG RUSH.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> what day is it?
<Jmo4267> Due to the fact it is Android Open API you could compare it to PC.
<Jmo4267> but you still can't touch the hardware.
<Jmo4267> ;-;
<Mutterguy> It's Christmas day, guvnor!!1
<oni_link> sonicrainboomer259|b: well yeah. the only console game I look foward to is Halo. Ports on consoles suck. and Ive gronw past the cod phase I was in when I first bought the xbox
<Jmo4267> lolhalo
<Flyboy> hi guys, what're we watching?
<prince-dari> Meh Halo
<Jmo4267> Halo 3 ended that series.
<prince-dari> Timesplitters is the shit
<Jmo4267> After that was dull.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> COD is overated
<sonicrainboomer259|b> ohai Flyboy
<Jmo4267> Timesplitters. My god.
<Jmo4267> Epic game.
<prince-dari> ^
<Jmo4267> Hey Flyoy
<Rarityisboss> (>^_^)>
<prince-dari> I love Timesplitters
*Jmo4267 flips table
*oni_link never played Timesplitters
<Flyboy> hey everypony
<Jmo4267> DAMN SCRIPT >_>
<prince-dari> Then get it
<prince-dari> It's PS2
<Jmo4267> You should go play it.
<AdamTheDuck> Hi Flyboy
<Flyboy> so whats this? and who is streaming it?
<prince-dari> PS2 is best console
<Jmo4267> Hello Flyboy. Tribes Ascend
*Alpha-Omega-Prime doesn't even know what timesplitters is
<Jmo4267> NO, SNES IS BEST CONSOLE.
<Flyboy> Jmo4267: kewl.
<prince-dari> Wrek is streaming
<XAX> oni_link: I was gifted both MW3 and BO during the summer sale. Im enjoying them >_>
<Jmo4267> Or N64..
<prince-dari> PS2 had all the good PS1 and PS2 games
<Jmo4267> And kicked again. fml
<prince-dari> So no contest
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> LOL
<IFDreebs> Is that Caravan Palace I hear? AWESOME.
<Rarityisboss> hey Wrek
<Jmo4267> ...Wow
<prince-dari> AHAHAHAHA
<prince-dari> Kick scripts really hate you
<XAX> lolraped Jmo4267
<oni_link> I think the Famicom Disc System is best console.
<Jmo4267> WOW FML.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> oni_link: the day of the 3rd and 4th Generations of console's were the best
<Jmo4267> I HATE THIS SCRIPT.
<AdamTheDuck> XAX: Is it your first CoD game?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> pc has emulators for all those systems and android has emulators for some of those systems as well.
<prince-dari> MW2 is my favourite CoD
<XAX> AdamTheDuck: I got #4 in '08 or something
<alexxm> boom
<Mutterguy> Jmo4267 count to two then press enter?
<Jmo4267> PS2 was great for its variety of games.
<oni_link> sonicrainboomer259|b: they were my favorite but they didnt age well
<Jmo4267> I can only count to potato Mutterguy.
<Jmo4267> :<
<Flyboy> this reminds me so much of unreal tournament, simply becuase lightning gun :P
<prince-dari> Prince of Persia trilogy
<AdamTheDuck> XAX: Then you won't understand the fact that the game has not changed sinse mw1...
<prince-dari> Highlight of PS2
<Jmo4267> ^
<Mutterguy> that'll do, just mouth the word
<Jmo4267> I'd prefer Ratchet and Clank though
<Flyboy> so is this free?
<Jmo4267> Best series ever made.
<oni_link> Flyboy: yeah
<AdamTheDuck> Plus CoD 1 and 2 were the best CoDs xD
<Thunder> Hellow :+
<Thunder> :3*
<Flyboy> oni_link: ooh boy! ima get it!
<Jmo4267> First CoD was the bomb.
<Jmo4267> Second CoD was great for multiplayer.
<Flyboy> thanks goodness for steam.
<XAX> Jmo4267: I have that game hiding on my hard drive somewhere.
<Jmo4267> CoD4/MW2 was good too. After that it just ran down-hill.
<AdamTheDuck> I still remember D-day landing
<Jmo4267> Nice XAX.
<oni_link> The first Modern Warfare was the best in my opinion.
<Jmo4267> ^
<Flyboy> Wrek: how are you guys communicating? skype? teamspeak?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I'm gonna get ready for church now.
<prince-dari> I think my favourite 'modern console' game is RDR
<Jmo4267> The only reason I've touched Black Ops is for Zombies. Nothing else.
<prince-dari> ^
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Peace
<prince-dari> So much ^
<Jmo4267> Zombies is THE BOMB.
<prince-dari> I played campaign too
<oni_link> Jmo4267: Hell yeah
<prince-dari> Because campaign is always fun
<Jmo4267> Yeah campaign as well.
<Jmo4267> but multiplayer..
*Jmo4267 shivers
<prince-dari> But yeah, zombies was the highlight
<XAX> Jmo4267: I've personally clocked up 24 hours on MW3 multiplayer and 27 hours or so on Black Ops singleplayer(Campaign is quite good, and zomg zombies).
<XAX> I don't really have high game standards though.
<Jmo4267> I've played 58 hours on MW3 multi, 52 on black ops single.
<oni_link> prince-dari: Treyarch makes better stories than Infinty Ward
<oni_link> IMO
<Jmo4267> Eh..
<prince-dari> Someone (I think DCD) told me there was going to be zombies with something like up to 12 people on BO II
<Jmo4267> Yes and no.
<prince-dari> oni_link: But Soap
<Jmo4267> Yeah prince-dari, they're using the multiplayer engine for Zombies this time.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> oni_link: what you talkin bout?i still have an N64 and play it constantly,and i have some gamecube games that i play on the wii,i also have a Ps2,and #1 fav game is from Ps2,which is Sly cooper 3(i love the other 2 though)
<XAX> prince-dari: hodamn that would be kinda awesome
<prince-dari> ^
<prince-dari> Gunna be sweet
<XAX> prince-dari: And omg future weponz
<Jmo4267> Nintendo were great with their line of consoles, but Wii/3DS was their downfall imo.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> what game is this excactly?
<Jmo4267> Tribes Ascend.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Wii is a pretty good
<sonicrainboomer259|b> console
<Jmo4267> Wii is alright..but still
<Jmo4267> I only got it for Metroid Prime 3
<XAX> They're gonna have to make much bigger maps for zombies if they intend to have up to 12 people being able to play though.
<oni_link> sonicrainboomer259|b: The 64 is a hit and miss for me. I still play it today though. For PS2, All I liked was Final Fantasy X and Snake Eater. And Gamecube was only good for first party games. Nintendo wasnt good for 3rd party support.
<AdamTheDuck> Wii convinced me to flail my arms infront of tv screen...
<Jmo4267> ^^^
<Jmo4267> Oh wow I love you oni_link
<prince-dari> >PS2
<prince-dari> >only liked a couple of games
<prince-dari> What the hell is wrong with you
<prince-dari> PS2 had so many brilliant games
<oni_link> Jmo4267: lol thanks?
<XAX> kingdom hearts.
<Jmo4267> KINGDOM HEARTS.
<Flyboy> 0.0
<AdamTheDuck> Ratchet and Clank
<Jmo4267> Kingdom Hearts, Ratchet and Clank, Final Fantasy
<Jmo4267> uh
<prince-dari> Prince of Peria, Timesplitters, Nightfire
<Jmo4267> Timesplitters yeah.
<XAX> Put it here Jmo4267. /)
<alexxm> jax and daxter
<Jmo4267> (\
<Jmo4267> Jak and Dexter.
<Jmo4267> First 3 were good
<Jmo4267> after that it went down.
<alexxm> dynasty warriors
<prince-dari> ^^^
<prince-dari> Yes
<prince-dari> I completely forgot
<prince-dari> <3 DW
<XAX> Jmo4267: Lol jak x.
*oni_link never played Ratchet and Clank, Timesplitters, Prince of Persia, Jak and Daxter or Dynasty Warriors.
<Jmo4267> LOL JAK X.
<AdamTheDuck> Lol I remember Dynasty Warriors
<Jmo4267> AHAHAHAHAH.
<AdamTheDuck> Are they still making those?
<alexxm> yep AdamTheDuck
<sonicrainboomer259|b> what about sly cooper?
<Jmo4267> I had that game myself, it was alright but total trash pile.
<Jmo4267> Sly Cooper!
<oni_link> or Sly Cooper :D
<XAX> Oh damn sly Cooper
<Jmo4267> wow oni_link
<Jmo4267> You need to..yeah
<MegaMoonShine> You have never lived, oni_link
<Jmo4267> Explore the PS2 to extreme lengths.
<XAX> I only ever played that through a hidden demo on the Ratchet and Clank 3 disc
<Jmo4267> Do it now.
<Jmo4267> Same.
<Jmo4267> Oh the secrets of Ratchet and Clank. <3
<Flyboy> so who else is playing with wrek? anyone else we know?
<sonicrainboomer259|b> i'm afraid to Sly 3 is my favorite game
<Jmo4267> All them bolts, all the upgrades.
<XAX> Jmo4267: Lightsaber wrench.
<Jmo4267> This script..
<oni_link> Lets just say I was too preoccupied watching my brother play Final Fantasy X and because of that, we never got games :D
<Jmo4267> Lightsaber wrench <3
<oni_link> He never beat it lmao
<Jmo4267> Ratchet and Clank Gladiator was bad-ass.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> i'm a Wii lover Jmo4267 deal with it
<prince-dari> You know what we forgot
<Jmo4267> I don't hate the Wii, I have one myself. It is just they could of done better.
<prince-dari> Star Wars Battlefront 1/2
<Jmo4267> ^
<XAX> OMG
<Jmo4267> I want my 3rd one. FML
<XAX> HOW COULD WE FORGET
<AdamTheDuck> LOVED THAT SO MUCH
<MegaMoonShine> prince-dari: YES!!! :O
<prince-dari> And the Lord of the Rings game was pretty sweet as well
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<oni_link> Okay, I have played Battlefront 2 but on PSP :D
<AdamTheDuck> PLAYED OVER 250 ON THAT xD
<Jmo4267> Hello GilDash
<MegaMoonShine> Hey GilDash :)
<Jmo4267> I remember playing battlefront with my friend after school everyday.
<Jmo4267> Fun times
<XAX> Jmo4267: Gladiator was actually pretty cool. And zomg co-op campaign.
<prince-dari> This is why PS2 is console king in my book
<Jmo4267> The co-op campaign was awesome.
<Flyboy> Wrek: 2 things, 1: who esle are you playing with? anyone i would know? and 2: how are you talking to eachother? skype? teamspeak?
<prince-dari> SO MANY amazing games
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Jmo4267: it's not nintendo's fault,it's all of dem 3rd party companies
<MegaMoonShine> PS2 was my whole life
<AdamTheDuck> Ah Battlefront 3... How we are never going to see you again...
<Jmo4267> ^
<AdamTheDuck> That game was been in production and stopped so many times...
<Jmo4267> I never knew the existence of the N64 cause of the PS3 sadly.
<Jmo4267> PS2^
<oni_link> sonicrainboomer259|b: Nintendo's strong point has always been the software. but I hope they get more 3rd party support with this new console.
<Jmo4267> Worth it though.
<MegaMoonShine> I had a n64 too
<Jmo4267> But these days I've got two N64 stashed in my game chest.
<oni_link> Battlefront 3 was pretty much done, then that studio flopped and we never saw it again
<prince-dari> Then of course PS2 has all the good PS1 games as well
<Jmo4267> I always enjoyed the freeroam of Jak 3..
<prince-dari> Since you can play PS1 on PS2
<XAX> prince-dari: Crash bandicoot.
<prince-dari> Spyro 1/2/3
<sonicrainboomer259|b> oni_link: that would be bad,cuz alot,and i mean ALOT of3rd party games on Wii suck
<Jmo4267> ^
<Jmo4267> There are so many games to list ;-;
<prince-dari> ^
<sonicrainboomer259|b> prince-dari: but you can't save :(
<oni_link> prince-dari: I was more of a Nintendo gamer to be honest. But the PS2 did have variety, I will give you that.
<prince-dari> Yeah you can
<Jmo4267> Memory card..?
<XAX> Jmo4267: I played the living crap outta Gran Turismo 2.
<Jmo4267> I never got into Gran Turismo XAX. >_>
<prince-dari> I played GT on PS1
<prince-dari> Was never any good at it
<prince-dari> But I played it anyway
<prince-dari> :P
<Jmo4267> I did play that one future racing game though..what is it called..
<alexxm> my dad played the first gran toursmo for ps3
<Jmo4267> It was all futuristic and trippy..
<alexxm> i menat ps2
<oni_link> sonicrainboomer259|b: No, the problem is that 3rd party devs hated working with the Wii hardware. lower graphics, low cpu.
<Jmo4267> I can't remember the name. QQ
<prince-dari> Uhhm
<XAX> prince-dari: I wasn't really the Greatest driver on it either. But as you said, it didn't stop a 5 year old me from playing it anyway.
<prince-dari> Only thing that comes to mind is Powerdrome or something like that Jmo4267
<pony_55> So, is this where you go for the "Friday Movie Night?"
<Jmo4267> Na that ain't it.
<oni_link> Oh crap, Gran Turismo 3, GTAIII, and SOCOM II were my everything
<Jmo4267> It had great music too.
<Jmo4267> lolsocom
<XAX> Pony_55: das rai
<sonicrainboomer259|b> prince-dari: when i played crash bandicoot 2,it never let me save, same with 1,had a memory card
<Jmo4267> The game that made CoD kids cry.
<XAX> Jmo4267: How so? ._.
<Jmo4267> I still remember the boulder from Crash Bandicoot. </3
<prince-dari> Well me and my sister still play PS1 together occasionally
<pony_55> <XAX> Thank you
<prince-dari> And we can save just fine
<prince-dari> We play on the PS2
<Jmo4267> XAX How so? It isn't to their liking.
<oni_link> Jmo4267: I played online, NEVER AGAIN. its too hard :D
<prince-dari> Just reminded me
<prince-dari> Digimon World for PS1
<prince-dari> That game is so hard, but so awesome
<Jmo4267> DIGIMON WORLD OMG.
<MegaMoonShine> Wish I still had my ps2... :(
<Jmo4267> SO GOOD.
<XAX> Jmo4267: Nothing is to a CoD fanboys liking.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> prince-dari: then why can't i save?
<Jmo4267> XAX Exactly ;D
<prince-dari> MegaMoonShine: D: you don't have a PS2 any more?
<XAX> Jmo4267: They don't even like their own game sometimes.
<MegaMoonShine> prince-dari: It broke... :'(
<Jmo4267> XAX YEP.
<oni_link> Did you guys know that if you transfer your save data from a PS1 card to a PS2 card, you can save and load from that PS2 card?
<MegaMoonShine> prince-dari: Happened quite a while ago actually
<Jmo4267> Yeah oni_link :P
<prince-dari> >:
<prince-dari> You should have gotten a new one
<sonicrainboomer259|b> i feel bad for joshscorcher,these retarde COD ganboy's and 10 yr old kids are giving him a bad name :(
<prince-dari> I still have my PS1 around somewhere
<Jmo4267> Mini PS1, still got.
<oni_link> sonicrainboomer259|b: who?
<Jmo4267> So small :3
<prince-dari> Hah, I just remembered a PS2 game that I really loved
<XAX> iPod touches can run PS1 emulators ._.
<prince-dari> Road Trip Adventure
<MegaMoonShine> prince-dari: O_______0
<prince-dari> I didn't think it would be my kind of game
<Jmo4267> Why did you have to say iPod and not Android. ;-;
<prince-dari> But when I started playing it
<oni_link> XAX so can Android devices
<prince-dari> I LOVED it
<MegaMoonShine> prince-dari: That game... was... EPIIIC!
<prince-dari> ^^^^
<oni_link> Jmo4267: they can
<prince-dari> It was absolutely awesome
<Jmo4267> oni_link Yeah I know, but he said iPod instead of Android. That makes me cry.
<prince-dari> So many good games, so much nostalgia. ;____; Want to play
<MegaMoonShine> SSX 3 and SSX On Tour were my drug
<prince-dari> Oh God, SSX
<sonicrainboomer259|b> oni_link: popular countdowner,unscripted video's,and more
<Jmo4267> Let's see what happens when I throw this out.
<Jmo4267> Pikmin.
<XAX> I played Devil May Cry quite a bit at a friends house.
<oni_link> Jmo4267: its okay * pats back*
<prince-dari> I never actually owned SSX, but I always used to play it around my friend's house
<Jmo4267> No bite? Oh wow ;-;
*Jmo4267 hugs oni_link
<Jmo4267> It ain't fair D:
<prince-dari> What console was it on Jmo4267?
<oni_link> sonicrainboomer259|b: hu?h
<Jmo4267> GAMECUBE.
<prince-dari> Ahh
<oni_link> *huh?
<prince-dari> I never had a gamecube
<oni_link> Jmo4267: it isnt D:
<prince-dari> PS1 was my first console
<Jmo4267> ..What
<MegaMoonShine> I used to play gamecube at my friend's house
<sonicrainboomer259|b> oni_link: search him up on youtube
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo4267: Was that the game where you gather those little wshatchamacall it
<Jmo4267> Commodore 64 was my first 'console'
<sonicandmario85> i never got to play a gamecube
<sonicrainboomer259|b> .....
<sonicrainboomer259|b> i don't get it
<AdamTheDuck> whatchamacall its*
<XAX> prince-dari: You know what I don't like? They stopped making PS3s with backwards comparability after a while. You need to get one of the older PS3s if you want to play your PS2 games on it.
<Jmo4267> I feel like the gamecube loner. ._.
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<prince-dari> I thought that was really cheap too XAX.
<prince-dari> But I've still got my PS2
<prince-dari> So it's all good
<XAX> Same.
<Jmo4267> lol XAX, I recently picked up a YLOD PS2 BC PS3 a week ago
<prince-dari> Would be nice not to have to worry about memory cards though I suppose
<Jmo4267> Tried fixing it, worked for 5 minutes and then went YLOD again.
<XAX> Bugger.
<Jmo4267> ragefest was involved.
<prince-dari> >:
<Jmo4267> Spent 2 hours fixing it too.
<Jmo4267> Got all excited..then boom. ;_;
<XAX> Jmo4267: Could try get some local tech shop to fix it or sumting.
<Jmo4267> Na, it was just a small project on the side.
<XAX> Ah.
<prince-dari> Sheep, Dog, 'n' Wolf was a great PS1 game too
<Jmo4267> Definitely not sending it to Sony, $170 to fix it. Fuu.
<Kandarihu> It's nice to see what these stages look like from the view of a system that can handle the game properly.
<XAX> lolfuckthat
<Jmo4267> ikr.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> prince-dari: i HAD a memory card and my Ps1 games wouldn't save:( i had to beat ALL of toy story 1 in ONE SITTING BECAUSE OF THAT!!!!
<Jmo4267> I think I did the circulation incorrectly.
<Jmo4267> So meh.
<prince-dari> sonicrainboomer259|b: I dunno why your console won't save, mine does fine. :<
<sonicrainboomer259|b> *toy story 2
<Jmo4267> SNES Toy Story.
<Jmo4267> Old times.
<oni_link> lol
<MegaMoonShine> Lol sonicrainboomer259|b
<prince-dari> Out of curiosity, how old are you Jmo4267?
<oni_link> sonicrainboomer259|b: i dont know who to search for
<Jmo4267> Such a pedobear prince-dari. I'm 16, 17 in December.
<XAX> I got a ps2 emulator recently to play an English cracked version of Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix. It runs that game fine, but for some reason if I try play one of the ratchet or clank games, or one of the jak games, it runs about 20-30fps.
<prince-dari> Ahh, 17 here, turned 17 earlier this month. :P
<Jmo4267> Nice :D
<sonicrainboomer259|b> prince-dari: what day is it
<Jmo4267> Oh XAX, how dare you use a PS2 emulator.
<prince-dari> 6th of July
<oni_link> dat feel when youre older then a mod
<MegaMoonShine> I had an N64 emulator on my old laptop
<prince-dari> Well I'm the youngest mod
<Jmo4267> Happy (23 days late) birthday prince-dari!
<oni_link> ^^^
<prince-dari> Hah, thanks guys. XD
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo4267: Dat quick maths :P
<oni_link> i didnt know that
<Jmo4267> I'm ditching cake at the screen, but it ain't working.
<XAX> Jmo4267: Can't buy an English version of Final Mix.
<Mutterguy> night all
<alexxm> happy late birthday prince-dari
<Jmo4267> True XAX, forgot about that.
<prince-dari> Night Mutterguy
<alexxm> bye Mutterguy
<prince-dari> Thanks alexxm
<MegaMoonShine> Night Mutterguy :)
<Jmo4267> It's like the special version of FF12
<oni_link> XAX: Final Mix :(
<AdamTheDuck> Night Mutterguy
<Jmo4267> Can't get it in Australia
<oni_link> Its JAP only
<XAX> oni_link: Yay fan made Engrish cracks.
<Jmo4267> Lol engrish.
<oni_link> XAX: lmao engrish
<Flyboy> who here knows a lot about tribes ascend?
<Jmo4267> Tribes Vengenace. ahh.
<Jmo4267> Vengeance^
<Jmo4267> Still remember picking that up from my local video store.
<Flyboy> Jmo4267: erm... is that a yes?
<oni_link> Dis game looks pretty
<Jmo4267> NOP Flyboy
<Jmo4267> Not gonna be touching Ascend
<Flyboy> damn it...
<Flyboy> i just neede to know something
<Jmo4267> It has microtransactions, that pushes me away.
<Jmo4267> Very far away.
<AdamTheDuck> It's like Combat Arms all over again
<Jmo4267> ^^^^
<XAX> That game is on steam now :|
<AdamTheDuck> PAY $10 TO WIN THE FREAKING GAME WHY DON'T YOU
*oni_link never played Combat Arms
<Jmo4267> IKR.
<Jmo4267> Played that game years ago, haven't touched it since. Not a good game really.
<AdamTheDuck> So stupid... gold perma guns for $20...
<oni_link> lol nope.avi
<XAX> The only reasons I stopped playing Combat Arms is because A: updates. B: hackers.
<Jmo4267> The picture for Combat Arms on Steam is disturbing.
<AdamTheDuck> Lol ikr ^
<Jmo4267> Mutation man holding 6 guns while looking cranky.
<Jmo4267> Yeah..
<alexxm> who the hells multialtion man
<XAX> I had p good aim on Combat Arms, so on most occasions I actually won gunfights with P2W players.
<prince-dari> Vi and I both used to play AA (though not together)
<Flyboy> anyone here heard of The Guild II?
<Jmo4267> nop^
<MegaMoonShine> Nope^^
<AdamTheDuck> Nah.pony
<Flyboy> then look it up, its amazing :)
<XAX> prince-dari: I forget names of all these F2P games. Which one is AA again?
<Jmo4267> 2006 Game and is on Steam.
<Jmo4267> heh
<prince-dari> America's Army
<XAX> Ah.
<Jmo4267> Oh America's Army
<Jmo4267> That was an alright game.
<XAX> I might give that a go. My old PC couldn't run it.
<AdamTheDuck> Was AA that military simulator?
<prince-dari> It was so annoying when you got shot and could only walk really slowly
<Jmo4267> Reminds me of ARMA
<prince-dari> Though some of the servers where they forced guns were a laugh
*oni_link was a console FPS gamer most his life
<Jmo4267> Oh lord oni_link
<XAX> >console
<XAX> >fps
<Jmo4267> please tell me you've at least played Counter-strike before.
<XAX> That is something I am not capable of playing.
<Jmo4267> I laugh at you. ;D
<XAX> Something about aiming with analogue sticks
<MegaMoonShine> Oh god...
<XAX> Im just not capable of doing that.
<XAX> I've tried many times.
<oni_link> I know what you guys were talking about but I never played them. And yes, I have played. I used to spend many hours at the cafe on that game.
<Jmo4267> Mouse/keyboard > Controller most of the time.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> WREK UPGRADED: your mom
<Jmo4267> Thank god oni_link
<HerpDerp> What's with the pasword thingey? :S
<Kandarihu> I remember playing AA. It was an alright game. I remember it got a unique kind of hate simply because it was a military recruiting tool. People were calling it propaganda because it wasn't hyper-gory.
<MegaMoonShine> I remember playing SW Battlefront 1 for the first time when I was a kid
<MegaMoonShine> "OMGOMG HOW DO I AIIIIIIM?!!?!"
<Jmo4267> Was gonna hurt you for a second. ;-;
<Flyboy> XAX: thats like the opposite to em, i can t aim without them
<oni_link> Jmo4267: At least I wasnt like HURR DURR I CAN PLAY THAT ON MAH CONSOLE
<Jmo4267> ^
<Jmo4267> Cause if you were, you would of been thrown out a window.
<Jmo4267> Multiple times.
<oni_link> I always knew PC>CONSOLE
<prince-dari> I prefer analogue sticks for aiming to beh onest
<Jmo4267> And a Sherlock episode comes to mind.
<XAX> Jmo4267: I borrowed a wired xbox controller off a friend one time and plugged it into my PC to use with some games. Bound all the keys on counter strike to appropriate keys on the controller. You know the first thing I tried with the controller?
<prince-dari> be honest*
<oni_link> I just never had the money for one.
<Jmo4267> XAX What's that?
<XAX> I tried surfing.
<Jmo4267> AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
<oni_link> LOL
<AdamTheDuck> lol
<Jmo4267> Oh XAX you poor guy.
<Jmo4267> Too funny.
<MegaMoonShine> Wut
<Kandarihu> I see Wrek is finally playing Sentinel. This should be an interesting sight
<prince-dari> Surfing?
<XAX> Jmo4267: It was the pure definition of HOWTHEFUCK
<AdamTheDuck> prince-dari: Surf maps
<MegaMoonShine> Kandarihu: Nope, Tribes Ascend
<XAX> prince-dari: YouTube "CSS surfing"
<oni_link> TF2 on consoles is a joke
<Jmo4267> ^
<Chrysalis> nice shot
<Jmo4267> Surfing is lots of fun.
<MegaMoonShine> Kandarihu: Wait, unless you mean the map or something...
<Jmo4267> Be it in CS:S or TF2.
<Jmo4267> CS: S
<Kandarihu> MegaMoonShine, I know he's playing Tribes Ascend. I meant the Sentinel class.
<Jmo4267> God damn emoticons.
<Jmo4267> Hey XAX, can you show me how to surf with a controller? :D
<XAX> Jmo4267: I like watching skill surf videos on YouTube. Its just amazing watching videos of pros playing certain maps and thinking "how the actual fuck"
<Jmo4267> I know right. I've seen this one guy that surfed so well and still could pull off headshots so simple.
<oni_link> XAX: how did that go by the way?
<Kandarihu> The map is Raindance. I recognize it the most from Tribes 2, more than any other... I think.
<XAX> Jmo4267: The next thing I tried with the controller was bunnyhopping :|
<Jmo4267> LOL.
<Jmo4267> LOLOL.
<XAX> oni_link: It went craply.
<oni_link> lol
<Jmo4267> How long ago was this XAX.
<XAX> Jmo4267: I play on a minigames server that has a serverside bhop script. All I had to do was hold down one button on the controller to jump. Strafing on the other hand... that was downright impossible to do well.
<Jmo4267> glhf.
<XAX> Jmo4267: Ever seen the video "phoon too much for zblock"?
<Jmo4267> YES.
<XAX> Good.
<Jmo4267> HE IS A MONSTER.
<Jmo4267> Defiles the law of Source engine.
<XAX> Jmo4267: First time I watched that. mfw. O_O
<Jmo4267> ^
<Jmo4267> I'd hate to vs him..so bad
<AdamTheDuck> I don't know, this game seems kind of bland evenf or a F2P...
<AdamTheDuck> even for*
<Jmo4267> F2p games are bland. :P
<AdamTheDuck> True...
<XAX> But yeah, you're right. He was doing that shit on an ESEA server with zblock enabled. Truly amazing he could pick up speed like that in the first place.
<Jmo4267> Yeah.
<Jmo4267> These days he is a commentator for some company.
<Jmo4267> But I bet he could jump right back in and defile everyone.
<XAX> Really?
<Jmo4267> Yeah
<Jmo4267> CS:GO E-sports or such
<XAX> Crap. Didn't know that.
<Jmo4267> Can't remember the name, saw it a while ago.
<XAX> Jmo4267: Aight.
<Jmo4267> I'm gonna flip this script and make it whimper.
<XAX> Bunnyhopping is truly downright nearly impossible on a default server now thanks to orange box update. But he could still molest everyone with his aim.
<Jmo4267> Yeah.
<Jmo4267> His aim is mental.
<XAX> All them 1deags
<Jmo4267> Even in original CS he demolished people.
<MrPipin> sup
<XAX> I didn't even know phoon played the other CS games ._.
<Jmo4267> I pretty sure he did..unless I'm thinking of someone else
<oni_link> Jmo4267: Jesus, I looked up that vid.
<XAX> You might be.
<Jmo4267> too much for zblock?
<oni_link> yep
<Jmo4267> No matter who you are, you will sit there and think what the actual buck.
<oni_link> I would cry and smash my monitor
<Jmo4267> ^^^^^^
<XAX> Jmo4267: The thing that I found really funny was the very first reaction. "LOOK AT THIS KID SCRIPT"
<oni_link> lol
<Jmo4267> I know right.
<XAX> He just sits there yelling trying to hit him with a USP
<oni_link> or that other one who was like , dude teach me to bunny hop, jk you scriptin
<oni_link> and the face shot :D
<Jmo4267> ^
<Jmo4267> Yeah I must be thinking of someone else..
<XAX> Jmo4267: The clip where he bhops up mid on dust2 and gets to B before the CTs. If that happened to me I would actually cry.
<Jmo4267> But he does the same stuff phoon does.
<Jmo4267> I wouldn't cry, I would chuck my tower out the window.
<XAX> ^
<Jmo4267> You wouldn't admit to him being legit, ever.
<oni_link> LMAO
<Jmo4267> You would instantly think, HE HACKS, GTFO.
<XAX> Jmo4267: LOLYOU
<oni_link> give him a pistol, youre screwed. Give him an AK, OH GOD
<Doobinz> Nice tribes
<Jmo4267> Give him a sniper, you will wet yourself.
<XAX> Jmo4267: He's another one that does similar things to phoon
<Jmo4267> Walking along, bang.
<oni_link> IKR
<Jmo4267> You sit there waiting to process it.
<Jim> Ohai guys
<Jmo4267> Yeah LOLYOU is mental.
<XAX> FROM IVY, OUT MIDDLE, THROUGH OUR CONNECTOR, LIKE A SPEED DEMON.
<oni_link> ^ ^ ^
<oni_link> I just went back to that part :D
<Jmo4267> The rage these guys create is just hilarious.
<XAX> Jmo4267: LOLYOU and his head/flashboosting
<Jmo4267> ikr
<oni_link> the rage is delicious
<Jmo4267> It is.
<alexxm> so much rage
<XAX> oni_link: THIS IS DELICIOUS. YES! YES!
<XAX> [/mbison]
<oni_link> XAX: :D you win!
<prince-dari> Wow, the handgun 1 hit kills?
<Jmo4267> The deagle yeah
<prince-dari> God damn
<XAX> prince-dari: To the head it does.

<Sumica> 00,10was trying to acount that this came out in the 90's
<Lyncast> and celestia did so love the ponies that she sent her only studen t, twilight to friendship for them
<Meanwhile> Ded.
<Lil_B> this doesn't look like ägyption :/
<Lil_B> tian*
<Garrettbrony> wheres kurt russel
<owloysius> but they don't know their own glyphs
<Sumica> 00,10woops
<Meanwhile> Und dann it doesn't work. Right?
<owloysius> or it's broken
<Garrettbrony> hippaglyphs
<Dark_Horst> Garrettbrony: that guy was only in the first movie
<Marx> sigh, Great.
<Meanwhile> Riiiight.
<Garrettbrony> what movie is this
<Meanwhile> Not a movie. Stargate SG1.
<owloysius> Garrettbrony: it's a Stargate episode
<Dark_Horst> Garrettbrony: episode
<twilight_sprinkle> it was like that when i got here, i swear!
<Garrettbrony> hey its McGyver
<Dark_Horst> Garrettbrony: dont tell me you didnt know there was a stargate seroes
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> dat canned lightning
<Dark_Horst> no really, dont
<Garrettbrony> Dark_Horst I did
<Mekapix2> McGyver? then alll they need to fix it is paperclips and a rubber band right?
<Meanwhile> McGyver'll fix the Stargate with a frying pan full of pancake batter and a weasel.
<Dark_Horst> but they have no paperclips. all they have are advanced tools
<killerpony7733> Ohhh norse!
<Garrettbrony> Mekapix2 ya the guy who played McGyer stared on Stargate\
<Dark_Horst> mcgyvers technical skill works directly antiproportional to his equipment
<Mekapix2> ok
<Garrettbrony> killerpony7733 Norse Mythollogy was the inspiration for Luna and Celestia
<Sumica> 00,10this is the power sorce here let me stick my hand in it
<Mekapix2> :D
<Dark_Horst> for science!
<Garrettbrony> i dare ya
<killerpony7733> Garrettbrony: Oh?
<Garrettbrony> yep
<TrixieMuffin> lick it
<Garrettbrony> i dare ya
<Garrettbrony> do it do it do it
<Dark_Horst> actually, that sun and moon relation they share was pretty much everywhere in ancient mythology
<Dark_Horst> but north is one of the closer ones
<Garrettbrony> Scootalium
<Meanwhile> We're now joking about his 50 year isolation? That was fast.
<Dark_Horst> EPIPHANY!
<owloysius> you could just write the primes...
<Garrettbrony> 50 year I bet the place that he took a crap in is probably overflowing
<owloysius> and how do you figure out the encoding
<Garrettbrony> Reading Rainbow
<Dark_Horst> science, obviously
<Lil_B> our existence :O
<Meanwhile> McGyver still thinking practical.
<Mekapix2> we are going to learn our existing from floating balls?
<Mekapix2> existence
<Dark_Horst> sure as hell not from maccaroni art
<Garrettbrony> the same reason we like ponies Mekapix2
<Mekapix2> lol
<Dark_Horst> or not
<Petrified_Discord> Nope.avi
<Lil_B> and leave your hand in it as long as the electricity makes noises
<noname> ^
<Dark_Horst> oh snap
<Garrettbrony> geronimo
<Sumica> 00,10hey look, they found a plot hole
<Marx> Wow.
<Garrettbrony> Sumica Badumching
<Flyboy> jump! jump! jump!
<Petrified_Discord> I betcha they use the power from the book thingy to power the stargate
<Meanwhile> Thor was an alien.
<Garrettbrony> Petrified_Discord either you seen this epiisode before or this show is really predicable
<Dark_Horst> whole of asgard was
<Petrified_Discord> Garrettbrony: the latter :)
<Shizuka> thank you tealc
<Garrettbrony> Predicatble show is predicatable. Place your bet to see how it ends
<Eli> na they use a lightning bolt to power up
<Lil_B> do clouds count?
<Shizuka> they need 1.21 jigowatts
<Lil_B> they need to 88mph
<Garrettbrony> Eli so this thing is also a time travel device
<Eli> 'back to the futur' style
<Meanwhile> Uhhh....NO.
<Garrettbrony> the best way to fix something is to bang it with a stick. A fact proven method
<Dark_Horst> Garrettbrony: i predict: they're home for supper. it's like star trek. the important crew never dies
<Sumica> 00,10fuck your knolage danny boy Jack wants to be home in time for the simpsons
<Midnight_Splendor> Except for daniel.
<Dark_Horst> ...well, except for that one running gag HE keeps doing but... oh well
<Meanwhile> Well that worked.
<Petrified_Discord> Pew
<MadSurge> Hullo Meanwhile :)
<Garrettbrony> Dark_Horst Unless the writers are told to be more edgy that is
<Meanwhile> Allo MadSurge.
<Eli> Dark_Horst sometimes a part dies, but never the whole crew
<Petrified_Discord> Yeah, like old man and lady aren't main cast, so they're in jeopardy
<Sumica> 00,10wait stadic?

<killerpony7733> Sumica: The luna has been doubled!?

<Kandarihu> QWOP's one weakness is itself.
<Garrettbrony> brodyquest would be a lot different is Brody ran using qwop
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lyncast: Will you behave?
<Dark_Horst> loving the helmets
<Mekapix2> how does he see through that?
<Meanwhile> Lyncast: I do.
<Lyncast> i may, probably
<Garrettbrony> Lyncast I think I do. your name sounded familiar
<flutter_spin> dat voice
<Lyncast> with a yes in there somewhere

<Dark_Horst> oh shite
<cachi01> twilight vs walking is a realy dark game........ i mean look at this comment The floor collapses, and Twilight spirals into darkness, her body breaking apart as she falls... only to awaken from the nightmare and realize she is to be forced to repeat the cycle infinitely? This is... a really, really dark game. Why couldn't you have ended it with a nice cake instead?
<Lil_B> I still want Metropolis or seven samurai for a Movie...
<Meanwhile> The neutrinos have mutated!
<flutter_spin> its ok. Season 3 is coming. Don't cry.

<Dark_Horst> Sumica: actually we're all talking bullshit. that'S brook parker. tela is playe by ratchel luthrell
<MaxTheBrony> heh :D
<Dark_Horst> but there's an undeniably similarity
<Mekapix2> dont like their culture, only good thing is the funky helmets
<MaxTheBrony> yea it is
<MaxTheBrony> The snake helmets :D
<flutter_spin> lol
<Sumica> 00,10I know Dark_Horst they look and sound alot alike though so I was just messing a bit.
<Sumica> 00,10it is the one from eurika though
<Dark_Horst> i notice it's been way too long since i saw stargate. should rewatch it all some time
<flutter_spin> way to go dad
<Sumica> 00,10it's funny they keep the young gould in a fish tank out in the wild outside of the castle walls.
<Dark_Horst> except universe. universe can die
<flutter_spin> I'll reach in my utility belt and pull out the cure
<shana> universe did die
<flutter_spin> aw
<Dark_Horst> not wuickl enough
<Dark_Horst> *quick
<Sumica> 00,10dont tap on the glass Danial
<Lil_B> erm... how about taking the Doctors though the stargates...
<MaxTheBrony> Did Allegro And Giga get their weekly stream? ( just Curious :) )
<Sumica> 00,104.......5.......6.....
<flutter_spin> denied
<owloysius> no gloves?
<Meanwhile> Lil_B: To the home of the enemy? That's a bit daft.
<Mekapix2> Lil_B: i assume they wont have the right tools or medicines
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: you relise that the whole planet is enemy territory, right?
<Eli> later someone drinks this
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<flutter_spin> oh snap!
<Dark_Horst> SHUT UP CARTER
<Meanwhile> Yeah well I don't care lady.
<Meanwhile> Fuck them.
<Lil_B> yes..-. but would still be better for the child... they ciould do it in secret
<owloysius> murderer
<Sumica> 00,10cant say I blame em
<owloysius> Call upon the sea ponies
<Spectrum_Rush|> just pest control
<alexxm> so why is he in the wrong for that
<Meanwhile> Lil_B: Too risky, plus they want to get them outta there anyway.
<flutter_spin> lets rest by this giant tree that looks like a foot
<Mysterypony> owloysius: those where g4 seaponies!
<flutter_spin> teleport?
<owloysius> should have taken more samples
<Kandarihu> If those symbiotes are capable of redemption, then Daniel was wrong to kill them.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I want an intestinal worm that grants me invincibility.
<Mysterypony> Kandarihu: agreed!
<Chrysalis> not invincibily
<flutter_spin> Reminds me of the Futurama episode Nit
<Chrysalis> just increased lifespan and regeneration
<Dark_Horst> and immunity to deaseases
<Chrysalis> certainly still killable though
<Midnight_Splendor> And strength
<Dark_Horst> *deseases
<flutter_spin> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01flutter_spin: I remember that one.
<Eli> couldn't they switch it back and forth till they reach the portal?
<Dark_Horst> it also makes for great party gags
<Sumica> 00,10good thing you cant hit shit with a staff weapon
<Chrysalis> the staff is a weapon of terror
<Chrysalis> its meant to scare people
<flutter_spin> They got denied for the role of stormtroopers
*Chrysalis holds up p90
<Midnight_Splendor> Staff weapon are desinged to install fear
<Chrysalis> this is a weapon of war
<Chrysalis> its meant to kill people
<Lil_B> Sumica that fires in a a perfectly streight line with 100% accuracy...
<Dark_Horst> it goes ratatatatat
<Kandarihu> Eli, a symbiote transplant isn't a casual matter
*Lyncast holds up a chysalis

<Mekapix2> that fish needs friendship asap
<Meanwhile> owlicious: Oi, I take offense to that.
<flutter_spin> cool
*Meanwhile slaps owlicious with a fried cod.
<twilight_sprinkle> owlicious: just a little more!! *cranks up to 11*
<Sumica> 00,10should have tryed the window sooner danny
<flutter_spin> Must we do this again?
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<prince-dari> Is fish man going for death by SG1
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But the episode would have been shorter.
<owlicious> and the women.
<flutter_spin> but. they. stay.
<Kandarihu> owlicious, knowing that doesn't mean jack if he doesn't know the address to Earth's Stargate. Besides, it was buried in sand for millenia and is now fitted with an iris that kills anyone who steps through without transmitting a current IDC.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sad fish is sad.
<Kandarihu> This episode did a nice job of bringing Sharae up in an organic manner. Later episodes just say "Previously on Stargate" followed by a reel of all relavent scenes that were clearly not from the previous episode.
<Mekapix2> just realised he looked like a fish had a baby with an ood
<flutter_spin> Can't decide if I want to stay or work on the fanfic

<Dken2021> cachi01 I fear the end result
<Michael> cachi01: i'm not scared
<Calcos323> It blew my mind

<MegaMoonShine> SuperBrony64: Bob's burgers
<Bronysith> Calcos323: nope

<ZappyTheUnicorn> Supersaga: Bob's Burgers
<Calcos323> Bronysith: Dammit
<MegaMoonShine> SuperBrony64: That was for supersaga sorry
<Bronysith> Calcos323: SuperBrony64 just said something about SAW

<Supersaga> Oh
<Michael> chat derped :(
<Bronysith> Calcos323: i dont care for the other saws as much as the first one. the first one was more mystery then gore
<CrimsonPhoenix> and Saw isn't a trilogy
<CrimsonPhoenix> it has 7 movies
<Calcos323> I agree
<Michael> SAW is a saga
<MaxTheBrony> O.o

<MaxTheBrony> Nope
<Meanwhile> SAW is a Brainmurderology.
<MegaMoonShine> Are we gonna watch SAW? :O That would be pretty cool
<Dken2021> does the model come with a little keeanu reeves?
<Calcos323> I could go for some SAW 1
<Mekapix2> octology is 8 i assume7
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01, it's called a saga like Michael said
<Dken2021> ah it does!
<MadSurge> cachi01: and you could see only the first without losing anything :D
<Meanwhile> Woah.

<SuperBrony64> 11,02So this is what playing Chess through the mail feels like...

<Bronysith> it is games like these that give gamers a bad name
<MegaMoonShine> SO... MLG!!!! :O
<CriticKitten> Well, you know. The call of someone would likely sound like a song, no?
<Pudge> wat
<cratorkid> MaxTheBrony: umm it looks best on pc , everything does

<cratorkid> Pudge: for leftys
<MaxTheBrony> cratorkid: i meant this looks almost identcical to the PC version ... and its on Wii :p
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Somehow...I screwed this up...

<MaxTheBrony> I hate the swedish dub
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Pudge> what
<Pudge> Swedish spitfire is smexy
<cratorkid> MaxTheBrony: everythings better in sweden
<Bronysith> Pudge: spitfire is sexy anyways

<Supersaga> Never heard any other dub...
<cratorkid> Pudge: spitfire is sexy allways

<Dken2021> nighty Mekapix2
<Attack|Minecraft> CrimsonPhoenix: Well we know Dash isn't a changeling for sure

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Them evil Russians.
<Supersaga> cratorkid: im sorry ur the bad guy :(
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: why are russians always evil now?
<cachi01> the government
<MaxTheBrony> O.o seriously how bad looking can a game become to be able to look the same on Wii as on PC
<cachi01> usa government is full with bullshit
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: Probably a holdover from the cold war.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: i thought it would be chinese that are evil since they have a shitload and could invade anyone at anytime
<cratorkid> SuperBrony64: its k , our manlyness detours americans so they make us bad guys in games
<Dken2021> Bronysith maybe it has something to do with being the lest known enemy all these years
<Dken2021> *last
<Spectrum_Rush|> Bronysith: russians are the new nazis
<cachi01> BRB i will play some Ib
<MaxTheBrony> oke :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01China is our new rival.
<Bronysith> Spectrum_Rush|: no
<Dark_Horst> submarines arent that spacy
<cratorkid> cachi01|Ib: Ib?
<Spectrum_Rush|> Bronysith: swaht the media thinks
<cachi01|Ib> cratorkid: yep its an awesome freeware game
<Bronysith> Spectrum_Rush|: nazis are pure evil. they did completely evil things and you can kill as many as you can with no moral conflicts
<cratorkid> Nittany_Discord: should be north koreah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't know if they want to nuke us.
<Supersaga> MaxTheBrony: who cares about Graphics? a mean i play minecraft and it dosent bother me
<Bronysith> Spectrum_Rush|: russians only had cold war with us
<cratorkid> cachi01|Ib: no what is it?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01NK isn't much of a threat.
<cachi01|Ib> cratorkid: you are a 9 year old girl called Ib
<sagas> Okay Ill give. When did we start streaming console games other than Wii games?
<lowfn> My cousin bought a plastic Batman Mask from the store.. I looked on the inside and it said MADE IN CHINA, I was like, " BATMAN's SUIT WAS MADE IN CHINA! "
*cratorkid cachi01|Ib nods " go on"
<Discord> This is wii
<Discord> Sagas this is on wii
<Dken2021> cachi01|Ib weird concept
<Pudge> sagas: this is the wii version of mw3
<cachi01|Ib> cratorkid: you go to an art exposition but when you see a certain pic you realize you are all alone and the paintings changed into some creepy stuff
<MaxTheBrony> Supersaga: True i dont care about the graphics normally , but in this case im afraid i do :) And the gameplay of this game is not welldone at all :(
<cachi01|Ib> as you advance you meet with a girl called mary
<cachi01|Ib> and a guy called garry
<sagas> Pudge: I dont think so. The Wii version doesnt have the crosshairs centered in the middle of the screen, but all over the place instead
<Dken2021> better rev up that rider kick
<Pudge> sagas: I saw him start it up on the wii
<Supersaga> MaxTheBrony: True, True. The Game likes to "F" with me alot, after that i play some minecraft lol.
<Pudge> >_>
<SuperBrony64> 11,02That slow guy got me ><
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<cachi01|Ib> mary is later revealed to be part of a painting and she wants to go to the real world but she has to replace someone in the real world
<Supersaga> XD
<MegaMoonShine> Ded
<Pudge> SB64 ded :<
<Discord> sagas: he is using a wii mote attachment that is like a Controller.
<sagas> Discord: That makes sense
<Spectrum_Rush|> Bronysith: iknow just thats wat hollywood is into is what i ment
<Dken2021> they must've taken their training from the stormtrooper acadamy
<cachi01|Ib> tango WHISKEY =D
<Bronysith> Spectrum_Rush|: but. hollywood doesnt make games....
<lowfn> Whiskey!
<MegaMoonShine> Tango Whiskey? That must taste horrible
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Spectrum_Rush|> Bronysith: you know what i mean
<cachi01|Ib> its made of tango blood
<Bronysith> Spectrum_Rush|: no. no i dont
<Dken2021> pretty sure hollywood still think playing games can make you a hacker
<cachi01|Ib> dafuq
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wish I could play Spec Ops with SB.
<cachi01|Ib> how can MARIO TEACHES TYPING turn you into a hacker?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: when is ur motherboard arriving. i really want to game with you
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It ships tomorrow.
<Spectrum_Rush|> Bronysith: the game industry, oh we need an enemy for the US... why not russians again and again and again
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Should arrive this week.
<Derpy_Hooves> what game is this?
<MaxTheBrony> Anyone of you guys going to be In the PlanetSide 2 beta next week?
<cachi01|Ib> Derpy_Hooves: MW3
<lowfn> I would make Antarctica the USA's enemy
<lowfn> :D
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: goodie cant wait to play good stuff with ya
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Nittany_Discord: I would love to play this with you too O~O, did you get the PC version?
<Derpy_Hooves> then i am not going to watch, i havent started the campaign yet
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SB: No.
<Discord> Superbrony you should play TF2 with us
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yeah, we're done with this game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Unless someone gifted it to me.
<Gabby> :s
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Time for the real new game
<Dken2021> I like to see a game where the americans are the enemy
<CrimsonPhoenix> This pic, the truth http://i.imgur.com/L62mP.png
<sagas> SuperBrony64: New game?
<cachi01|Ib> new game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dken2021: Spec Ops: The Line is sort-of like that.
<Pudge> what new game?
<JESmith71> You guys can go back to Brawl if you want, since that lag/freeze was my doing
<MegaMoonShine> lol CrimsonPhoenix
<Discord> LET'S WATCH BLACK BUTLER ON NETFLIX
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix but I like using the thimble...
<sagas> CrimsonPhoenix: random....
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But good luck advertising a game where you're fighting America.
<Pudge> JESmith71: doubt he will, brawl is naturally laggy too
<Dken2021> at least it's something different
<cachi01|Ib> Nittany_Discord: why not?
<sagas> Would Spec Ops The Line happen to be on the Wii?
<Discord> Superbrony how did you get different sounds?
*sagas misses the Game Cube
<cachi01|Ib> the only ones not buying it might be government fANS
<JESmith71> So it wasn't completely me?
<cachi01|Ib> ^^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Especially when the super-offended people start mouthing off "You're disrespecting American soldiers fighting America!"
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Discord: Different sounds?
<sagas> It was my first console
<MirrorImage> cachi01|Ib - the equivalent would be an Xbox game being made where Microsoft is the major villain corporation
<P4ngya> "prepare...to kill your fellow citizens...like never before"
<MirrorImage> not goint to happen.
<Pudge> :OOO
<Discord> Superbrony when you click the disk channel and stuff.
<cachi01|Ib> MirrorImage: and soooooooooo
<Pudge> YES
<Marx> Ooh.
<cachi01|Ib> XENOBLADES FUCK YES
<Pudge> Best RPG this gen!
<Purple`Prose> oooooo o.o
<MirrorImage> cachi01|Ib - Xbox is a Microsoft product...
<MegaMoonShine> Aaaaand this is?
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: America has so much self-loathing, its a feature not a hinderance
<Alfopony> ;) nice
<lowfn> Id like to see a game where you are a single man and your job is to kill every human on the planet but yourself
<CrimsonPhoenix> Aw shiiit
<cachi01|Ib> MirrorImage: and soooooooooooo
<MirrorImage> they would NEVER let a game be made under that premice
<sagas> wat this?
<CrimsonPhoenix> a great game for once
<Purple`Prose> Behold, the Monado!
<cachi01|Ib> MirrorImage: those bitches gotta deal with it
<Dken2021> xenoblade eh?
<MirrorImage> ...or they can say "No"?
<Supersaga> So whats this game all about
<MirrorImage> their console, their rules
<cachi01|Ib> lowfn: i am alive
<MadSurge> :O
<Meanwhile> This looks JRPGish.
<RobertRevenge> Meanwhile: Because it is
<Discord> Hope this isn't boring.
<CrimsonPhoenix> it is JRPG
<cachi01|Ib> lowfn: destroy all humans
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohhh Xenoblade
<MirrorImage> Meanwhile - gee... i wonder why?
<MaxTheBrony> Im off to bed , Bye all! :D
<Meanwhile> Well there goes any hope I had of this not sucking.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A good game would have you as a British secret operative fighting Corporate-backed Imperialist America in the near future.
<Dken2021> it's because it is JRPGish
<CrimsonPhoenix> but I believe there's some action in it
<sagas> JRPGs are hit and miss with me
<cachi01|Ib> bye MaxTheBrony!
<Discord> OMG I LOVE DESTROY ALL HI,AMS
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Night MaxTheBrony :)
<Supersaga> Bye MaxTheBrony :D
<Discord> HUMANS*
<Pudge> Xenoblade is the best rpg of this generation
<Pudge> good night MaxTheBrony
<cachi01|Ib> loooooooooooong
<MadSurge> I gotta go to bed guys, see you all tomorrow! :D
<Dken2021> sagas even action RPGs?
<MegaMoonShine> Night MaxTheBrony :)
<Discord> Full of shit
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: Not going to happen. Britain is just as bought out
<Pudge> night MadSurge :)
<Dken2021> night MadSurge
<cachi01|Ib> lol
<mishia> pinkiepie: BOOORRRIINNG
<Purple`Prose> and I was British.
<alexxm> bye MaxTheBrony
<Meanwhile> I hate JRPGs.
<Discord> and died
<Spectrum_Rush|> Nittany_Discord: fund it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01To support a new civil war against the corporate regime.
<lowfn> cachi01:Ib: But those games you dont get to kill EVERYONE... alot of people but not everyone.... I want to get to kill 6 billiob people
<Dark_Horst> which game?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It would rock.
<Supersaga> What if it just ended their O.O
<sagas> Dken2021: I said JRPGs, Not ARPGs
<Discord> smelled like crap
<Meanwhile> I mean, look at these things. They look ridiculous.
<MegaMoonShine> Then everything changed when the fi- *gets slapped*
<derpy_pony> good morning bronies :)
<Alfopony> parry damit
<Bronysith> Pudge: idk. final fantasy 13 was great. i mean the story was fantastic with good gampl BAHAHDSHAHHAHAHAHA. ahhh lame, i could not say that with a straight face
<Pudge> Meanwhile: JRPGs are great if done right, not that load of crap known as final fantasy 13
<cachi01|Ib> lowfn: uhmmmmmmmmm scribblenauts!!!
<sagas> so what is this?
<MegaMoonShine> Morning derpy_pony :)
<lowfn> cachi01|Ib: :D
<Meanwhile> Pudge: Honestly, I have never seen a JRPG done right.
<Dark_Horst> which game is that? assuming it is one
<Pudge> Bronysith: I own FF13 and I hate it
<cachi01|Ib> lowfn: just type great hydron collider and thats it MASSIVE GENOCIDE
<P4ngya> bio vs mech?
<Discord> over a cookie
<Bronysith> Pudge: it is the worst final fantasy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol Discord.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Meanwhile, what is a JRPG?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek cookies :D
<sagas> JRPGs are hit and miss. Final Fantasy missed and the Persona series hit
<Discord> is a cookie
<Dark_Horst> cratorkid: japanese rpg
<alexxm> then it wasn't a timeless battle
*cachi01|Ib eats Discord
<Discord> D:
<Dark_Horst> CrimsonPhoenix: japanese rpg
<Pudge> Everything pre FFX are good final fantasys
<Supersaga> SuperBrony64 Do You Liek Mudkipz?
<CrimsonPhoenix> let me rephrase
<sagas> Looks like a japanese Starship Troopers
<CrimsonPhoenix> What's a JRPG done right?
<sagas> CrimsonPhoenix: The Persona series
<cachi01|Ib> FFX was uhmmmm how can you describe it? oh yeah HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA
<lowfn> cachi01|Ib: But the game I want is a game where I want it to be personal.. as in killing each person with SMALL bombs, guns, tanks, not something the kills more than 1000 people instantly
<Pudge> CrimsonPhoenix: Baten Kaitos Origins
<Dken2021> dem mooks
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Supersaga: They cool :3c
<Shamroc> GRUNTING
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm asking that to Meanwhile
<Discord> HYEA HYEA HYEA... HYEA
<CriticKitten> Really, FFX would have been a great game if about half the cast wasn't in it.
<sagas> -_- of course a guy with a sword
<Alfopony> who made this?
<CriticKitten> And that's counting Tidus.
<cachi01|Ib> CriticKitten: and dat laugh......
<Supersaga> :D
<Pudge> CriticKitten: yeah the acting is bad but the battles are fun
<Discord> bad lip syncing
<Discord> horrible voice acting
<Pudge> and the music <3
<RobertRevenge> sagas: What do you expect? It's XenoBLADE.
<sagas> poor mouth animations
<Discord> bad avatars
<Dken2021> hello obvious guy who will backstab me at the last minute
<Dark_Horst> games didnt always have crytek facial mimics
<Discord> = gunna be a horrible game.
<MegaMoonShine> Waaaht?!
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: Oh, it's a Japanese rpg. Usually means a protagonist with a goofy looking weapon, stupid hair, bad dialogue, and half the game is cutscene.
<Supersaga> Dat Voice Acting
<sagas> RobertRevenge: I did not know it was that game
<Pudge> I mean if a game have good music that can almost single handedly save a game
<Meanwhile> And sure enough, this has all of those already.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Meanwhile, and that's a JRPG done right?
<sagas> Whats there to control?
<CriticKitten> The combat system is fantastic. The sphere grid is admittedly not great but it could be a LOT worse. And some of the cast are really enjoyable.
<sagas> YOU BEAST!
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: There isn't one.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Meanwhile, that's why I'm asking, what's a JRP done right for you?
<cachi01|Ib> Chocobo de battle LOL
<CrimsonPhoenix> JPRG**
<cratorkid> ok im back ... what is this
<Pudge> CriticKitten: Wakka is my fave
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: Wouldn't know, because one doesn't exist.
<Discord> Edward scissor hands?
<sagas> Characters look like they belong in One Piece
<CriticKitten> Wakka annoys me.
<Dken2021> cratorkid Xenoblade
<sagas> inb4 he dies
<Supersaga> Pudge: Well Sonic 06 had good music but it sucked >.<
<CrimsonPhoenix> Meanwhile, then you just hate JRPG in general
<CriticKitten> He borders between insufferably stupid and downright insensitive.
<Alfopony> looks like ff
<sagas> So its wrong to obey retreat orders?
<cachi01|Ib> sonic CD scares the shit out of me
<Pudge> Supersaga: besides that one, dont mention that pile of shit to me :[
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: exacta.
<sagas> Its wrong to want to live to fight another day?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Meanwhile, there has been JRPG done right
<Supersaga> Pudge: Lol Sorry
<Discord> It's like world of warcraft
<sagas> Looks like Final Fantasy
<Discord> NO
<JESmith71> Supersaga: "It feels like a cheap imitation of Star Wars Episode II which was a cheap imitation of a love story. Double the fail for half the price!"
<cachi01|Ib> looks like WOW
<sagas> Without turn based
<CrimsonPhoenix> but you just don't like the presentation, the cast or pretty much whatever's in it
<Discord> FINAL FANTASY TYPE BATTLE STYLE SUCKS
<Alfopony> that what i said
<CriticKitten> Take Wakka, Rikku, and Tidus out of the game, though, and you have a pretty darn good cast.
<MegaMoonShine> cachi01|Ib: This looks nothing like WoW
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: name one done right.
<Discord> I hate final fantasy battles.
<Dken2021> so much grunting
<sagas> Discord: Pokemon says otherwise
<Pudge> The only really bad final fantasy battle system is FF13
<CrimsonPhoenix> Meanwhile define done right
<Discord> I like pokemon, that's the only kind I like
<Pudge> I mean come on, you only control one character and the others act on their own?
<MegaMoonShine> cachi01|Ib: Well, only a bit
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: Not shockingly bad.
<Pudge> Really?
<sagas> Meanwhile: Persona series
<cachi01|Ib> i wonder how FF versus XIII will be
<CrimsonPhoenix> Meanwhile, is it to suit your personal taste
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: There's no such thing as impersonal taste.
<CriticKitten> cachi01: It won't be anything. They've cancelled it.
<Discord> BUT WHO WOULD STAND THERE, TWO FIERCE ENEMIES, JUST STANDING WAITING FOR THE OPPONENT TO TAKE A TURN.
<P4ngya> these robots must be duds
<sagas> Discord: POKEMON SERIES!
<cachi01|Ib> guys what if...... KINGDOM HEARTS 3 HAS TIDUS IN IT :(
<Discord> I like pokemon saga
<Pudge> Tidus isnt bad
<Pudge> he just needs food
<Dken2021> cachi01|Ib KH1 already had him in it
<cachi01|Ib> Dken2021: yeah but as a kid
<Discord> KH 3 is coming
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile play the last remnant
<CrimsonPhoenix> Meanwhile, are you implying the game industry should focus on what you like and what you think is good?
<cachi01|Ib> Dken2021: and as a kid he is not annoying
<RobertRevenge> Discord: Pokemon is the exact same way? What real creatures take turns attacking each other instead of mauling each other head on?
<sagas> Discord: it has that kinda combat
<CrimsonPhoenix> Meanwhile, that sentence was hypocritical
<CriticKitten> Well, I should say they've casually avoided saying the words "cancelled" but have completely moved all staff involved in its creation into other projects without trying to be public about it.
<cratorkid> Discord: the games are awesome but the tv show is the mmost repetative crap ever
<CriticKitten> So yeah, Versus is very likely dead.
<Discord> sagas I know, it's my only exception
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: I'm saying it sucks. What it thinks of what I think of it is irrelevant.
<Supersaga> So many reused voices XD
<Pudge> You could call pokemon a jrpg
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Discord with a pink, fluffy cloud.
<Pudge> it has many of the elements of a jrpg
<cachi01|Ib> talking about cancelled games did you guys ever heard of Eight Days?????????
<CrimsonPhoenix> There are JRPGs done right since it fits the critera that makes a JRPG
<CriticKitten> It IS a JRPG.
<Discord> CAN WE JUST WATCH BLACK BUTLER ON NETFLIX?!?!?
<sagas> these character are gonna be annoying
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Discord: Not unless SB wants to.
<sagas> yes 3 guys kill dozens
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Why does it take me 5 min to beat one of these things yet now they are just slicing their way through like they were butter? O.o
<CrimsonPhoenix> Meanwhile, then you have no right in saying that you haven't seen a JRPG done right
<Discord> SuperBrony can we watch Black butler on netflix?
<CriticKitten> SB64: Because plot convenience
<Dken2021> SuperBrony64 that's the power of cutscenes
<Dark_Horst> sooo... are their swords guns or are their guns swords?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> SuperBrony64 cause cutscene ?
<MegaMoonShine> Wow, they sure improved...
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: Fair enough, let me rephrase. JRPG's are shit. Better?
<sagas> like it wast obviouse he was evil
<CrimsonPhoenix> and that's your personal opinion
<Marx> Betrayal!
<Supersaga> Did he say bannana?
<Dken2021> oh what a shock
<sagas> Meanwhile: Pokemon was a JRPG and not shit...
<Marx> -50 Loyalty
<MegaMoonShine> Stupid coward!
<JESmith71> SuperBrony64, the magic of the characters somehow being able to do things in the cutscene that they can't do in-game
<sagas> dat nose
<CrimsonPhoenix> also FFIV didn't involve a cast of character with goofy hair
<CriticKitten> I wouldn't say that in general, Meanwhile. I think that some of them have some good elements, it's just that the genre's currently bogged down in what I dub "Twilight syndrome".
<Discord> He's going to get a banana?
<sagas> :D
<Meanwhile> sagas: Got bored of Pokemon around Gold. Nowadays it's just rehash.
<CrimsonPhoenix> as well as FFVI
<alexxm> well he's going to die
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm bored of this game :3
<Supersaga> Discord : LOL
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01All of those sniper dots.
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: Implying anything short of fact isn't opinion.
<Dken2021> but you just started....
<Discord> Superbrony can we watch Black Butler on Netflix?
<sagas> Meanwhile: Im reffering to the ones up to ruby/saphire
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: ffvi is tied with ffvii and chrono trigger for my fav game of all time
<Shamroc> I LIKE YELLING!!!!!!
<Spectrum_Rush|> CrimsonPhoenix: lets put it this way, Meanwhile 's dislike of JRPG's is like your dislike of Rina-chan... maybe?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Discord: I don't know...can we?
<sagas> Meanwhile: And they are a new group for every generation
<Eulshy> Otay, im back and what is this?
<MegaMoonShine> Epic pan out tiiime!
<Dark_Horst> why would one dislike rina?
<Meanwhile> sagas: Wouldn't know how many that is, because I don't care about pokemon.
<Shamroc> SuperBrony64...no no no we dont want to watch that
<Discord> Superbrony May* we watch Black Butler on Netflix?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Spectrum_Rush|, I respect that he dislike JRPGs
<owloysius> who's Reina-chan?
<Purple`Prose> whooooosh
<JESmith71> Turn-based RPGs bore me. Kingdom Hearts I like because of the real time battles...and mainly because I'm a Disney fan
<Shamroc> Discord: SHAME ON YOU....we are not gonna watch that..
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm just pointing out how FFIV and FFVI had a bad-ass cast of characters
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SuperBrony64: Let's watch G3 ponies!
<Discord> Have you seen it Shamroc?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hey, that sounds like a plan!
<owloysius> but it was good
<Supersaga> D:
<Dark_Horst> owloysius: voice-actress, been in some games and does an incredibly authentic twilight voice
<Eulshy> What game is this?
<owloysius> not the g3s
<Spectrum_Rush|> CrimsonPhoenix: and i respect that you dislike rina-chans VAing
<CriticKitten> SB should totally go get Sengoku Basara and stream that. D:
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay!
<owloysius> oh, that's who rina is.
<Shamroc> Discord...read a few of the manga...and my otauku freind...she...wont stop talking about it..
<LightSoul> Oh wow...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark_Horst, she's just lucky that Tara is in her slim voice-range
<Discord> Superbrony I wanna watch black butler D:
<sagas> Meanwhile: Well to each there own then, but you would be the minority. Pokemon games up until Ruby/Saphire are usually accepted as classics
<Eulshy> What game is this?
<LightSoul> theres actually people here...
<Meanwhile> I don't particularly care for rinachan either.
<Bronysith> What system is this game for...
<RobertRevenge> Bronysith: Wii
<Dark_Horst> CrimsonPhoenix: probably. sounds authentic either way
<Eulshy> What game is this?
<MegaMoonShine> Eulshy: Xenoblade
<RobertRevenge> Eulshy: Xenoblade Chronicles
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm done playing :)
<Bronysith> RobertRevenge: why does xenoblade have to be for the wii...
<Pudge> SuperBrony64: so what's the plan now?
<Eulshy> Doesn't matter now
<CrimsonPhoenix> and it's not exactly authentic
<Discord> netflix
<Meanwhile> sagas: Whether or not I'm in the minority is irrelevant, you're asking me personally.

<Lunar_Brony> Spectrum_Rush| AVGN came before NC
<cachi01|Ib> Spectrum_Rush|: nostalgia critic is a friend and fan of james
<Marx> In other words, he's looking at a 2.6 inch game screen...
<cachi01|Ib> Spectrum_Rush|: james inspired nostalgia critic
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I sometimes think people watch the AVGN for the guy just to yell his brains out, regardless of what the episode is about than to actually show a game.
<Spectrum_Rush|> :D knew that would get aresponse
<Pinkielover123> | PRINCESS.|
<Pudge> didnt AVGN and Nostalgia Critic do crossover?

<Pudge> Nittany_Discord: ah yes I remember that, good christmas special

<Spectrum_Rush|> Nittany_Discord: yeah its all about the games
<JESmith71> I loved AVGN's SwordQuest review, since it was very informative of that old Atari contest
<Pinkielover123> Till the insult video.

<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: and he became the laughing stock of the internet
<cachi01|Ib> irate gamer IS A COPYCAT

<RAWRity> Dovah: Angry Video Game Nerd
<sagas> SuperBrony64: Could you argue that AVGN copied Zero Punctuation?
<Dovah> ah
<Pinkielover123> Imgine 1 precent.
<cachi01|Ib> but james besides doing good reviews and giving actuall useful information he does a funny show while doing it!

<Eulshy> I like the one guy who uses his abination fingys
<Kandarihu> He's not even all that ticked off. He's played it before and enjoyed it in a warped way. If any adjective could be used to describe him, it's not irate.
<Lunar_Brony> Pudge just look up "Kickassia"
