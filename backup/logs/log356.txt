<Lasharus> Although I annoy them enough.
<moop> Muppets are better than puppets
<Lasharus> They can't seem to grasp the concept that big chunks of food DON'T FIT DOWN THE KITCHEN DRAIN.
<KetaminaDianePie> hahahahahaahaa
<Jim> But Moaaaa
<Midnight_Tempest> :D
<Lasharus> So every time I find the drain clogged by chunks of food, I stand in the middle of the hallway and shout something like "NEWSFLASH: IN A SHOCKING DISCOVERY, IT WAS FOUND THAT BIG THINGS DON'T FIT THROUGH SMALL THINGS!" at the top of my lungs.
<RaveBrony> hahahaha!! Good afternoon Bronystate! xD
<KetaminaDianePie> hahahahaha
<Lasharus> Followed by "CLEAN IT THE F*CK UP YOU TWATS"
<Lasharus> Then I go back into my room.

<RawketLawnchair> Silly Digimon.
<prince-dari> I like the PS1 digimon worlds game
<NewDCD> 09,01Digimon is best Mon
<ColgateSparkle> Why do japanese voices always sound the same? I hope that doesnt sound racist :(
<diddutz> RaveBrony: It's like a cooler version of pokemon in general
<prince-dari> But I like Pokemon better in general
<Ingwaz> nope, i'm too good to do that otakon1
<Ingwaz> otakon1:
<ekips> that star has got the gurenn lagann shades
<derpy_pony> japan only has like 3 voice actors
<otakon1> prince-dari: you too? I never managed to beat it though
<Dken2021> yea! pokemon
<NewDCD> 09,01Pokémon was good because of the games
<ColgateSparkle> Haha
<Turgle> ColgateSparkle: same question here
<Midnight_Tempest> digimon season 1 and 2 were best seasons
<otakon1> ekips: it also looks like the King Kittan
<NewDCD> 09,01but I got bored of those because it's a rehash EVERY SINGLE YEAR
<Morty> lucemon doesnt look like a digimon
<Dark_Horst> wait WHAT? wasn't that angelkid the bad guy last time i checked?
<NewDCD> 09,01in Digimon 04, yeah

<Dark_Horst> and i remember a time when that taelking ming vase was a huge asskicker
<NewDCD> 09,01namely, with Ryo, who was from the world of Adventure, and traveled to the world of Tamers

<NewDCD> 09,01also I like how in this series, the Human MC is like a "tactician" general rather than a simple partner
*TOY_PON3 is not grounded anymore

<otakon> um
<RawketLawnchair> Ga h hah haha.
<ekips> dude, thats creepy
<NewDCD> 09,01Best quote
<prince-dari> Wut
<otakon> that face is oddly femine
<prince-dari> What was that about a fanbase?
<KetaminaDianePie> .....
<otakon> femenine
<alexxm> falldown mode
<NewDCD> 09,01dari: FANGIRL fanbase
<RawketLawnchair> Lilith. . .I know that's a reference to some demon in some mythology.
<NewDCD> 09,01they dig characters like that
<NewDCD> 09,01the fangirls.
<otakon> oh, it's busty again
<Dark_Horst> that'S becasue the original myth of amgels displays them as genderless
<otakon> NewDCD: that never made sense to me, WHY do fangirls go for guys that look LIKE guys?
<otakon> ahem
<otakon> GIRLS
<otakon> ded
<Morty> why the lipstick?
<otakon> damn
<bear2229> we need more people like this http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-its-cool-bro.jpg
<otakon> who's this chick?
<Dark_Horst> HAIRCZTS
<NewDCD> 09,01for the same reason that the females who guys find attractive have more testosterone than regular girls, true story
<RawketLawnchair> Iron Largechest!
<otakon> NewDCD: really?
<NewDCD> 09,01said features are found to be rather attractive by them....akin to a moving piece of art
<otakon> BIG McLARGEHUGE!
<otakon> hmmm
<otakon> that's odd
<Dark_Horst> i knew it EVERYONE'S GAY.
<Dark_Horst> they just don't notice
<Morty> i liked the gen where the human MCs had like power cards and tactics
<Morty> the one with renamon
<diddutz> Openings were more epic back in my childhood
<NewDCD> 09,01well I'm just speculating, but yeah, the more "attractive" a woman looks, chances are they recieved more prenatal testosterone in the fetal stage
<emangamer> hello everypony
<emangamer> :3
<Dark_Horst> that was tamers
<otakon> I always prefer my girls look like GIRLS! Wide hips, ample curves and such

<emangamer> Sumica: I am the least loved pony :< what can I say.... </3
<otakon> really?
<otakon> that makes NO SENSE to me
<KetaminaDianePie> hhhmpfffffffffff
<NewDCD> 09,01thing is....more testosterone does not equate to more masculine
*Sumica pats emangamer on the head. I still like you
<Starflash> wait. teapotmon used to be like 10 meters
<NewDCD> 09,01it all depends on hormonal ratios and shit like that
<ekips> everypony is loved equally emangamer :)
<NewDCD> 09,01shit's complicated
<Starflash> why did he shrink to... that
<emangamer> Sumica: but you like everyone else more, right?

<Lasharus> Of course it's subjective to my tastes. I think it looks horrendous :P

<MahBoi777> it's an EPIC MEDIC
<emangamer> Seriously KoutarouTaiga could this show have ANY MORE fan survice?
<Yahooz> MFW i missed the mane6 room update on the newletter XD
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01emangamer: it's one of the bad points of Final
<Morty> wow that looked like good shit
<CriticKitten> eman: Could be worse. We could be watching Freezing.
<Turgle> yay drawfriend stuff!
<Kencolt> So... basically she gained super mental powers by getting stoned.
*mario_pony feels like shit for no reason
<GaoFighGar> Kencolt: yes.
<TOY_PON3> mario_pony: Same here
<Meanwhile> TOY_PON3: Francis is reserved for when L4D is actually on.
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01but at least it's not as horribad as shit like HSotD
<GaoFighGar> that's Papillon
<GaoFighGar> also DCD
<MahBoi777> mario_pony: same
<GaoFighGar> it ain't that bad
<Moonlight> I'm just going to AFK for a bit
<GaoFighGar> the fanservice is overshadowed by the sheer awesome
<CriticKitten> HSotD was almost hilarious in its misunderstanding of physical attributes.
<TOY_PON3> I hate it when Meanwhile knows when to hate......
<emangamer> KoutarouTaiga: I've been popping in and out ever few minutes and ever time I see either cleavage o pants so tight that their legs should be falling off
<Meanwhile> I can't see anything but the fanservice.
<MahBoi777> Francis is ALWAYS necessary when hate is involved!
<Meanwhile> Why is this girl such a bitch?
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01also, by the last episode, Meanwhile will learn about the virtues of COURAGE and HOT BLOOD
<Kencolt> Well, one could call it awesome fanservice? ^_^

<Meanwhile> Sup
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Don't like the langauge though, we can handle this in a civil manner.

<prince-dari> I didn't name anyone specific eman.
<Lasharus> Hey SuperBrony64|AFK. :)
<emangamer> prince-dari: and I didn't think you were implying it, but I want it on the official BS record. You know shizu logs everything :P

<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Dat Shizu ping
<GaoFighGar> Shizuka pong :3
<emangamer> it's on the record
<Yahooz> I agree with SB. Also, If users prefer that something else be streamed, go watch it on youtube or someting :p

*emangamer makes Nittany_Discord explode again
<DeadlyDerp3> "Flasher :(!"
<Moonlight> something epic is going
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02If you don't like what's streaming, you can always pause the stream and watch something else.
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01MIKOTO, BIG DAMN HEROES

<Yahooz> Saturn: I approve XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This show is so random.
<prince-dari> Hah, I've watched some episodes of that Saturn
<CriticKitten> O.o
<Lasharus> I'm with SuperBrony64|AFK on this one. As I've said on several occasions before - not EVERYTHING can be done perfectly to your liking. Shit happens.
<GaoFighGar> it isn't random. it's just that you missed 50 episodes of plot
*emangamer is confused by the giggle physics in this show... :/
<prince-dari> What GaoFighGar
<Saturn> 08,01middle class foxes... it's my adolescence all over again
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01pretty much that.
<prince-dari> said
<Meanwhile> There are robots and some space jerks who want to remake a universe or something and some robots aren't actually robots and this chick has hot blood and that guy has a nose like a toucan's beak...
<GaoFighGar> >Toucan beak
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Makes perfect sense!
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Just follow your nose!~
<prince-dari> You can't restream all the episodes everyone missed everytime someone new joins.
<GaoFighGar> dude
<emangamer> Meanwhile: yea I noticed the nose
<CrimsonFoxx> Are they like reploids from Mega Man X or something?
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01002 nose
<GaoFighGar> that's a shout out to cyborg 009
<Meanwhile> No shit you can't.
<prince-dari> So if you don't understand what's going on, that's just kind of too bad.
<emangamer> prince-dari: NOWAI....you cant?
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01is best nose
<emangamer> KoutarouTaiga: how does his nose compare to Seto Kiaba's?
<DeadlyDerp3> ...That's the stupiest robot
<Morty> koutaroutaiga: was that a cyborg 009 ref?
<DeadlyDerp3> And it's Singing
<Meanwhile> prince-dari: No, really? here I think you should accomadate me at start from the beginning. I'm just giving my own little slice of experience from this thing.
<GaoFighGar> >mfw I get so signal
<Yahooz> You have to watch anime from the beginning in order to truly understand what the hell is going on
<GaoFighGar> OH FUCK THIS SEKAI.
<OneTrickPony> lol old fart
<CrimsonFoxx> It would help if I even knew what this show is even called
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01Morty: Cyborg 009, ever watched it?

<Moonlight> Damnit! another person died!
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Genesic_GaoGaiGar - don't make me launch the Egg Carrier.
<Moonlight> hello LadyCanary
<Meanwhile> Hey LadyCanary
<LadyCanary> Ohai
<Lasharus|Robotnik> The system's firepower is more than plenty to deal with this.
<She> Hello there.
<Meanwhile> Pasta machine.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> told ya
<FirePower> god damn it
<emantrollslayer> does this show even know what dark matter is?
<GabeMoist> Ohai M31

<DarkMatter> .........
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> it's whatever needs to be
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> because COURAGE
<emantrollslayer> Meanwhile: i do
<Meanwhile> It's a macguffin for the time being.
<DarkMatter> hm?
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> >Superhero Apocalypse
<CriticKitten> emantrollslayer: This show was made in the very late 1990s, of course it doesn't
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> better get your tissues ready
<Meanwhile> Not as good as One Man Cheeseburger Apocalypse.
<SuperHeroApocalypse> hehe
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> because MANLY TEARS WILL BE SHED.
<LadyCanary> Is there something streaming?
<Lasharus|Robotnik> And autopaused again.
<Meanwhile> There is.

<ManlyTearsWillBeShed> eh?
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01canary: refresh
<prince-dari> LadyCanary: Yeah, refresh
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Am I the only one to whom that keeps happening on veemi?
<Meanwhile> Looks like it so far Lasharus|Robotnik
<Lasharus|Robotnik> The stream just randomly pausing for no apparent reason?
<ManlyTearsWillBeShed> hmmmm
<prince-dari> Not for me
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Blegh.
<Lasharus|Robotnik> This requires further research then.
<ManlyTearsWillBeShed> dumb ad
<emantrollslayer> how long has this show been streaming now?
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> it's your internet connetion
<Lasharus|Robotnik> I very much doubt that Genesic_GaoGaiGar.
<Yahooz> emantrollslayer: since yesterday
<emantrollslayer> Yahooz: my god...really?
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> most likely noise on your line
<LadyCanary> There we go.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> I had that yesterday
<Armageddon> <macrocat> I installed Ubuntu but it just throws me into a debian console.
<Yahooz> not straight thorugh
<Armageddon> ahahahaha
<Yahooz> *through
<emantrollslayer> DAT SHOW TITLE :d
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Genesic_GaoGaiGar - I'm on a 100mbit university uplink. :P
<Yahooz> but it STARTED yesterday
<LadyCanary> Ohdang
<Moonlight> Where's ZA POWA
<STARTED> Okay
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Also, it ONLY happens with Veemi.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> I see
<ONLY> Mhm
<CriticKitten> ...human Fluttershy? o.o
<ONLY> eeyup
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> maybe it's something related to Veemi and your college?
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> also no.
<ONLY> ._.
<Lasharus|Robotnik> That's a possibility.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> that was 1999
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> OH SHIT
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> HIS EYES
<Meanwhile> Oh hey bird face does have eyes.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> THE ONLY TIME IN THE ENTIRE SERIES
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> HIS EYES ARE SHOWN
<PinkiePie101> Guys
<Moonlight> uh she's back
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> now the REAL BATTLE begins
<PinkiePie101> I'm sure you would like to know who was doing that weird nickname change thing
<Meanwhile> Wouldn't have known if you hadn't said, is there something special about his eyes or are they just hidden because?
<PinkiePie101> Well
<PinkiePie101> It was....
<TopHat> Hey Doctor
<emantrollslayer> KoutarouTaiga: is...he part machine or something?
<PinkiePie101> MY MOM! AHAHAHAH- Just kidding c:
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Yes TopHat?
<prince-dari> INB4 entire anmation budget in this episode
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> emantrollslayer: almost
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01Gai is an EVOLUDER
<TopHat> hello
<LadyCanary> O U
<Lasharus|Robotnik> 'ello.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> he was a human who became a cyborg
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> who then, by the power of the G Stone became an evoluder
<Moonlight> woah!
<emantrollslayer> prince-dari: I've learned to watch this show for it's pretty flashing lights
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> an Evoluder is like a superhuman
<Meanwhile> Well at this point I'm definitely not watching for the plot.
<LadyCanary> Oh bby. This is pleasing me
<Moonlight> did he just catch up to his own bullet
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> Moonlight: yes
<Meanwhile> LadyCanary: -_^...
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> that's how awesome he is
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol. 5 Daring Do ask blogs now up. That's quick. Wonder how many will stay around.
<otakon> busom!
<Moonlight> AMAZING! :O
<otakon> moar busom!
<PinkiePie101> :o
<emantrollslayer> Nittany_Discord: my guess? 2
<Meanwhile> Probably only one or two.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> also LadyCanary, you'll LOVE the next episode
<otakon> so MUCH BOSOM
<Lasharus|Robotnik> "go go gadget..."
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> episode 8 has the MOST AWESOME moment ever
<PinkiePie101> Go go gadget gun.
<emantrollslayer> otakon: that pretty much describs this entire show, as far as I, someone who has no idea what the hell is going on, can tell
*PinkiePie101 shoots all
<Meanwhile> Gogaigargadget.
<otakon> indeed emantrollslayer
<Moonlight> is it neccessary to name every attack?
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Genesic_GaoGaiGar - stop telling us that. I'm sure we'll see awesome soon enough. :P
<emantrollslayer> Moonlight: yes
<Meanwhile> Moonlight: of course.
<emantrollslayer> POLEMYRIZATION
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd think a text and a drawn one would survive. The one that updates the most and/or does the best job at emulating the character will have the best chance of staying around.
<Moonlight> I should really realize that by now
<Meanwhile> Ok so most of them are robots, cept one that is some kind of ship and a...statue and a metronome.
<emantrollslayer> Nittany_Discord: well you can't really have the best job at emulating the character, because we know so little about her. It will probably the one that makes the character the most entertaining.
<LadyCanary> This is so MANLY.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01True.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> LadyCanary: marry me :V
<Moonlight> LadyCanary: eeeyup
<Meanwhile> Careful LadyCanary, it'll put hair on your chest.
<LadyCanary> ....Too soon for me.
<LadyCanary> D;
<emantrollslayer> how many proposals does LC get per day I wonder?
<LadyCanary> ...
<emantrollslayer> 3 is my guess :d
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> She's a woman who can appreciate the AWESOME of GGG
<Yahooz> emantrollslayer: about 5?
*LadyCanary hits emantrollslayer with a newspaper. NOPE.
<LadyCanary> =_=
<Moonlight> too much to count
<Meanwhile> Told.
<Yahooz> Well settle for 4 then
<emantrollslayer> LadyCanary: ;___; sowwie :(
<LadyCanary> The correct answer is 0.
<Moonlight> or that many
<Yahooz> I was only 5 off :3
<prince-dari> Technically for today it's 1.
<prince-dari> :P
<Meanwhile> It'll happen someday LadyCanary.
<Morty> gagaggagagagaga
<Meanwhile> And I'm sure the moment will be truly special.
<Yahooz> what prince-dari
<TopHat> OOPS I LEFT CAPS LOCK ON
<TopHat> sorry
<Yahooz> said
<emantrollslayer> LadyCanary: you can't say that, because you just got one: P
<LadyCanary> True, dari.
<emantrollslayer> :P*
<Moonlight> GAGAGAGAGA
<Yahooz> so how many is that in total?
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01has chest grown on all of your hairs yet?
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> MY CHEST
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01...derp, I mean, hair grown on all of your chests
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Um.
<emantrollslayer> KoutarouTaiga: what?
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Ah. :P
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> HAS HAIR
<Meanwhile> Mine would've had I not removed it the other day.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> THAT HAS CHESTS
<LadyCanary> Indeed, Taiga
<PinkiePie101> this chat just got 20% cooler http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvmLvJFK07M
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> THAT HAVE MORE HAIR
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Rainbow Dash Swag" - "Ranbow Dash has moves The Song or My little pony does not belong to me"
<Yahooz> KoutarouTaiga: I have more chest hair than previously if thats what your asking
<Midnight_Tempest> MY CHEST HAIR HAS TRIPLED!
<GabeMoist> Even my chest hairs have chest hairs!
<Dken2021> welp, back from fooling around with famitracker for 3 hrs
<Meanwhile> I looked at the stream "Get ready to take a pounding!"
<PinkiePie101> haha, the chest has been tripled
<TopHat> Chest hair? Pics or it didn't happen!
<LadyCanary> Hiii Dken2021! :3
<Meanwhile> It pays to either pay complete attention, or no attention.
<Dken2021> hey LadyCanary
*Nittany_Discord 11,01lowers the chat room temperature by 20%.
<LadyCanary> ...Brrrr.
<PinkiePie101> LOL
<PinkiePie101> i c wut u did there
<Meanwhile> Chat is 20%...colder.
<emantrollslayer> Nittany_Discord: but, now its too cold :(
<Moonlight> the cold
<PinkiePie101> TOO COLD
<Dken2021> that's..... mildly cold
<PinkiePie101> SOMEONE GET ME A BLANKET D:
*Meanwhile hands PinkiePie101 a duvet.
*Midnight_Tempest starts a fire
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> MY HOT BLOOD WILL MAKE THIS CHAT HOTTER
<PinkiePie101> ah, thats better
<TopHat> how much is 20% in temperature?
<Meanwhile> Depends what temperature it was originally.
<Dken2021> 1/4 a temp?
<PinkiePie101> 20 degrees i suppose
<Dken2021> or 1/5?
*Meanwhile covers his hoof with his face.
<LadyCanary> Spiral drill. Huh.
<Meanwhile> That isn't how temperature works!
<TopHat> ya
<emantrollslayer> well technically, TopHat, it would be 20% of the Kelvin scale, because you cant take a fifth of something that doesnt start at 0. So mathamically speaking, 20% is quite a substancial amount
<prince-dari> Damn
<TopHat> thats what I'm saying
<prince-dari> Well-placed sword much
<emantrollslayer> true factz
<Midnight_Tempest> hax
<emantrollslayer> prince-dari: *holds up hands* animators
<Moonlight> This must be the final battle
<Meanwhile> The wrath of the boomerang robot guy.
<Meanwhile> Scary.
<TopHat> Absolute zero is −273.15° C
<LadyCanary> ....Pretty o___o
<Moonlight> I'm prepared for Explosions
<otakon> more reentry

<Moonlight> Goodbye PinkiePie101
<Thunderpony> MORE FAIRIES
<otakon> so many BUSOMS!
<prince-dari> Fight his own father?
<emantrollslayer> Thunderpony: you misspelled Pinkie Pie
<Meanwhile> Try not to dribble everywhere otakon
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> it's not his father
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> it's more like an evil clone
<Moonlight> prince-dari: that's rough
<Thunderpony> I didn't say pinkie pie...
<otakon> ooooohh
<otakon> dat one too
<emantrollslayer> Thunderpony: I know that's what you ment though
<otakon> holy shit
<otakon> well that was horrifying
<Thunderpony> It's not
<otakon> um
<emantrollslayer> Thunderpony: it was
<Moonlight> badass
<Thunderpony> No.
<Thunderpony> I see fairies in this show, not ponies.
<Meanwhile> Bird guy has interesting hair.
<otakon> the one scene of her screaming in pain with DOZENS of needles in her?
<otakon> THAT wasnt' horrifying?
<Thunderpony> Seen worse pal
<Moonlight> that wa pretty scary
<Meanwhile> Watch out guys we've got a badflank over here.
<Moonlight> but not that bad
<otakon> Thunderpony: you are desensitized
<TopHat> I got it. Assuming it's about 15* C in here, 20% colder would make it -51.63* C
<TopHat> so we'd all be ded within minutes
<Thunderpony> I have seen worse, that's why.
<Yahooz> lolwut?
<otakon> and WHY have you?
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> HOLD HANDS
<Yahooz> Lick her then burn her... seems logical
<Moonlight> perfect logic
<Thunderpony> Because you're in shock
<Moonlight> dat nose
<Thunderpony> BS NO JUTSU
<Moonlight> It's just too big
<otakon> I'm not in shock
<Meanwhile> Im surprised his helmet can fit it all in.
<otakon> I've seen crazy shti too
<Meanwhile> Or could before it broke anyway
<emantrollslayer> oh they've "powered up" alright
<Thunderpony> Boner?
<Yahooz> Ive seen enough anime to know where this is-- actually, i dont :p
<Thunderpony> This music is annoying
<Meanwhile> Agreed.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> this is going to AWESOME
<Meanwhile> So you keep saying.
<Moonlight> there should be an explosion here
<Yahooz> inb4 POLYMERIZATION
<Meanwhile> Oh hey it's the peacock bot again right?
<Thunderpony> Synchro summon!
<emantrollslayer> Yahooz: oddly enought I wasnt going to do it this time
<Moonlight> King J-DER!

<Thunderpony> You never heard of a synchro summon?
<Midnight_Tempest> RoBUTTnik
<Yahooz> Gao Gao Power Rangers?
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Sometimes I commit puns prince-dari - it's a failing of mine.
*Lasharus|Robotnik smacks Midnight_Tempest upside the head.

<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> GAO
<prince-dari> Lul
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Meh, I'd prefer an Egg Dragoon dari. :P
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01it already exists
*Midnight_Tempest kicks Lasharus|Robotnik. I will always say it, ALWAYS!
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> TAOSE!
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01GaoRanger is what's known as Wild Force in US
<LadyCanary> Indeed DCD.

<Lasharus|Robotnik> Midnight_Tempest? "always" is a depressingly short amount of time for you, should you presist in this...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> lol at RaiRyu can't land
<Lasharus|Robotnik> In case you're wondering, YES, the Egg Carrier is en-route.
<Meanwhile> Apart from the Forever Red episode. That I liked.
<Moonlight> it's a big blimp
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01Gao is basically the sound of an animal's Roar in Japanese. It's like going "ROAAAAAAAAAAAR"
<Midnight_Tempest> RoBUTTnik RoBUTTnik RoBUTTnik RoBUTTnik RoBUTTnik TOTALLY WORTH IT!

<Pegasister16> What are you guys doing?
<Meanwhile> I have no idea what you just said Thunderpony but it sounded card gamey
*Lasharus|Robotnik calmly observes the nuclear fireball that was formerly Midnight_Tempest's home.
<LadyCanary> Roarranger, DCD XD
*Nittany_Discord 11,01bathes in fireball.
<Moonlight> Maser?
*Lasharus|Robotnik is faintly worried about some weirdo apparently bathing in the fireball. What the hell.
<Moonlight> A man laser?
<emantrollslayer> Thunderpony: for UU I cast counterspell
<Thunderpony> UU?
<emantrollslayer> :|
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<Moonlight> A Mare laser?
*Midnight_Tempest laughs as he transmits from a bunker deep in the earth. HAHAHA! RoBUTTnik!
<emantrollslayer> Thunderpony: double blue
*Meanwhile dusts Nittany_Discord's shoulders.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Meanwhile
<Thunderpony> You mean double summon?
*Lasharus|Robotnik sighs.
<emantrollslayer> Thunderpony: no, double blue, so I can cast counterspell
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Engage PlanetCracker. To everyone else on earth - blame Midnight_Tempest.
<Thunderpony> It's still my turn though
<emantrollslayer> Thunderpony: http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=185820&type=card
<emantrollslayer> it's an instant
<Thunderpony> Robots being emberassed over robot boobs?
<Lasharus|Robotnik> ........
<Midnight_Tempest> Totally worth it
<emantrollslayer> oh great, her tits are flashing
<Meanwhile> And they light up to.
<Thunderpony> Wrong game dude
<prince-dari> Lul
<Morty> rofl
<Meanwhile> How peculiar.

<Thunderpony> Two different games
<Moonlight> OH YEAH

<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01and These two, Red and Blue, did it first.
<otakon> Robot witha a big ches
<Thunderpony> I was talking Yugioh, you seem to be playing magic the gathering o.o
<Midnight_Tempest> RoBUTTnik! what kind of name is that! LAWL!
<Meanwhile> DCD consider me enlightened to a degree
<Thunderpony> This music sucks!
<otakon> Meanwhile: LOL!
<emantrollslayer> Meanwhile: seriously, what happened to love and tolerance?
<Thunderpony> It died with discord
<Lasharus|Robotnik> ...fire.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> FUCK LOVE AND TOLERANCE
<Meanwhile> Don't know what you mean emantrollslayer.
<Pegasister16> Midnight_Tempest: A very funny one lol
<emantrollslayer> Genesic_GaoGaiGar: that was uncalled for
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> :3c
*Nittany_Discord 11,01sits on Genesic_GaoGaiGar
<Thunderpony> I may not have seen this anime before, but i can tell when it's pulling total transform crap.
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01I agree with him : / mainly because bronies mistake "tolerance" with "moral blindness"
<prince-dari> ^
<Meanwhile> I rather like love and tolerance. But I also believe not all things can be tolerated.
<prince-dari> That's what ponychan used to do at any rate
<prince-dari> Dunno about now
*Midnight_Tempest is saved by nothing as the world explodes. Game Over. Out of continues. 'O_o HAX!'
<emantrollslayer> I think this needs to be the brony code: http://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyn3e1uznI1r6yguzo1_1280.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ6IHWSU3BX3X7X3Q&Expires=1328752448&Signature=zr93C2NtPtsc1Um8Yg0nWP8rxIU%3D
<emantrollslayer> KoutarouTaiga: that is trut, but you still have to act respectful, else you are no better than the /b/tards
<Moonlight> ^ agree
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I guess "Love and Tolerance" is a conditional thing.
<Meanwhile> More like a relative thing.
<Midnight_Tempest> that is awesome emantrollslayer, 40k ref ftw
<Pegasister16> emantrollslayer: Just for that, I'm giving you a BROHOOF!
<Lasharus|Robotnik> emantrollslayer - EVERYTHING is better than /b/

<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01That's okay, I'm not looking to be better or worse than anyone :V I'm looking to just be me.
<Meanwhile> And now the robot is drugged up to?
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> HE'S DRUGGING HIMSELF
<Meanwhile> Good grief.
<Midnight_Tempest> SNAKE FINGERS!
<Meanwhile> Steroid bot is go.

<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> OHOHOHOHO
<Moonlight> lolwut
<Lasharus|Robotnik> KoutarouTaiga - you might not be trying, but nobody has to TRY to be better than /b/. It's something that comes naturally to most of humanity.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> HE JUST ASKED FOR IT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Literal love and tolerance will make you friends in some places and get you flattened by others.
<Thunderpony> This anime is just trying it's very hardest to be a good mech anime
<emantrollslayer> prince-dari: and then a follow up pic: http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsgs3deNdm1r2tzuto1_500.png
<Thunderpony> But it's doing too much BS
<emantrollslayer> Nittany_Discord: it's nice to know where to draw the line on loving and tolerating
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01Thunderpony doesn't know shit about good mech anime.
<Moonlight> EXPLOSION!
<Thunderpony> I know this isn't one
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes.
<Meanwhile> Don't have enough experience with mechanime to comment on it in that regard
<Pegasister16> Is this the same anime we were watching earlier, or did it finally end?
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> it's the same
<otakon> eeyup, same
<Meanwhile> But I'm only recently grasping what's actually happening.
<Thunderpony> In my opinion there has only been one good mech anime.
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01you kind of missed 50 episodes worth of TV show plot, plus 6 of OVA plot
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01so yeah.
<Cypresswolf> what anime are we watching now?
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Stupid bloody auto-pausing VEEMI!
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> this is the AWESOME AWESOMELY ENDING
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01inb4 Gurren Lagann
<Moonlight> the next is the final episode right?
<Thunderpony> No
<Thunderpony> Gurren was ok
<Meanwhile> Ofc everything is better with plot.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> yes
<King> Wuz going on in here?
<Thunderpony> Epic, but not the best
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> wait wait
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> you saying Gurren Lagann was ok
<emantrollslayer> you wanna see epic: http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyndr6F7Uk1rnpo0wo1_400.gif
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> and this is not?
*Midnight_Tempest sneaks onto the Egg Carrier and stands behind Lasharus|Robotnik. '<_< >_> RoBUTTnik...'
<King> The hell is this
<Cypresswolf> GGG still?
<Pegasister16> When will we reach the final episode?! :O
<Meanwhile> Boohoo people have opinions.
<Thunderpony> In my opinion gurren was ok
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> what are you smoking?
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01This is one of the main inspirations behind Gurren Lagann
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01so yeah
<emantrollslayer> wait for the gif to load
<King> How am I unable to guess
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> indeed
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01so what is this good mech anime you speak of?
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01INB4
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Midnight_Tempest? Off my ship. Shout all the insults you like, but get off my ship. Now.
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01THE LEGEND OF THE BLUE WOLVES
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Or I'll teleport you inside an active volcano.
<prince-dari> Lolwut
<Thunderpony> G-Gundam of course :$
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> Gurren Lagann draws heavily on GGG, Getter and other classics
<Midnight_Tempest> T_T but... but... the Egg Carrier is so awesome...
<emantrollslayer> prince-dari: do you want me to relink that pic again/
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01....this is kind of like G-Gundam
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01although yes
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Yes Midnight_Tempest. Yes it is. That is why I will not allow someone on it just to insult me. Off.
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01G Gundam is fucking amazing
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> DCD
<prince-dari> Lawl, nah I got the Pinkie AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA gif eman
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> you must stream G Gundam next
<prince-dari> XD
<Kencolt> if anyone doesn't think GGG draws on Getter Robo, I want to know what they have been smoking.
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01indeed.
<otakon> KoutarouTaiga: eeyup
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01get ready
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01for
<emantrollslayer> prince-dari: pinkie durell?
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01FINAL of FINAL
<otakon> um
<Meanwhile> I don't know any of the anime you're all talking about.
<Moonlight> FINALLY!
<Thunderpony> Boobs are everywhere
<Cypresswolf> windows crashed my fallout game :| played 6 hours straight last night and nothing happened. barely hit 2 hours today and friggan vista couldnt take it anymore :[
<otakon> WHY IS EVERYONE NAKED?!
<Morty> wtf
<LadyCanary> What's your favorite Gundam series, DCD?
<Meanwhile> I'm sure they're all...nice.
*Midnight_Tempest gives Lasharus|Robotnik a glare then sighs. 'Fine... Doctor Robotnik... I'll go... T_T'
<Pegasister16> YES!
<The_4th_Wall> Is #Pinkie_Pie down?
<LadyCanary> Because Japan, otakon.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> Kencolt: it draws a lot from Getter, Mazinger and other classics
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Thank you. You may stay.
<Lasharus|Robotnik> That was really all that was required.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> this ladies and gents
<Meanwhile> The_4th_Wall: pony channels are now reserved for mane showings.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> is the end
<prince-dari> All the main 6 rooms are closed until the pony ep
<otakon> The_4th_Wall: no, ALL the theaters are down to keep down on upkeep
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01LadyCanary: X, because it's like UC Gundam, but without the emo bullshit. And Garrod is boss.
<Moonlight> can I break you The_4th_Wall?
<Meanwhile> Close ALL the theatres otakon?
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> KORE DA KIMARI DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Midnight_Tempest> Yay! *starts pressing buttons all over the Egg Carrier*
<emantrollslayer> Who here is an epic science nerd?
<The_4th_Wall> Maaayyyybeee
<Meanwhile> You probably emantrollslayer
<Thunderpony> JJBA
<LadyCanary> Ah. What's your opinion on 00?
<Moonlight> :3
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Thank god I keep the system in total lockdown unless it's me operating it...
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01I fucking love me some JoJo
*The_4th_Wall fractures
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01it's my favorite manga
<Pegasister16> Depends, what kind of science?
<emantrollslayer> Meanwhile: I just want to make sure that his has some meaning to everypony: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvjy86SXHV1r3shcio1_400.jpg
<Thunderpony> I'm surprised anyone got that :o
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01Astray also did
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01we're JoJo nuts
<Meanwhile> Titrations. Rave.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> indeedo
<emantrollslayer> KoutarouTaiga: ORLLY.jpg
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01hell I streamed the JoJo OVA here a few days ago
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> also LadyCanary, 00 is mediocre
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01that said
<Midnight_Tempest> I like Gundam Unicorn myself
<Thunderpony> :'( The joy is so much
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01wait for it, Thunderpony...get ready for HOT BLOOD
<Thunderpony> Does it involve boobs?
*emantrollslayer still has no idea what the hell HOT BLOOD is
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01no
<Thunderpony> Good
<prince-dari> The JoJo OVA was awesome. The water guy was so OP.
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01it involves epic
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> it has a very good first half, but as Code Geass, its second season is amazingly underwhelming
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Am I the only one who also really liked the second season of that? :P
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> most likely yes
<The_4th_Wall[Borderl> Geass/
<Meanwhile> JoJo is always at least amusing in a bizarre kind of way.
<Cypresswolf> Did ya'll upgrade the viewing window? stream is running smoother for me
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Fair enough :P
<The_4th_Wall[Borderl> Geass?
<Thunderpony> I thought R2 was more like "HEy we're back, but we lost control of our bowls so we stink" wasn't a big fan of R2
<The_4th_Wall[Borderl> I've got an R2 poster on my wall
<emantrollslayer> KoutarouTaiga: I have yet to see this HOT BLOOD of yours
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Is she using a giant sugarcube as a weapon?
<Moonlight> god I need to catch up on my anime
<Thunderpony> Mostly because they KILLED the main character for justice
<Thunderpony> I never liked killing the main
<Pegasister16> Cypresswolf: I know! So much less buffering! Last night was a NIGHTMARE!
<mario_pony> i can't see anything my internet freezes everytime i try to watch this.:'(
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> >dat piano version
<Pegasister16> I'm sorry...
<Meanwhile> Sometimes killing the main character is just the way the story goes.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> brb man, wiping the MANLY TEARS
<The_4th_Wall[Borderl> I've been buffering since i came in
<Meanwhile> Not often, because killing the person we've been empathising with all that time is usually a dumb move.
<Kencolt> Thunderpony: Yes. Yes they did kill him... all according to his plan. He'd set himself up for it. Ultimate sacrifice, that.
<Cypresswolf> I have some upgrades going on the background. stream lags when that happens. Its flawless :)
<Moonlight> :( I feel sorry for you mario_pony
<Thunderpony> Yeah, still...it makes me feel hollow when the series ends and the main isn't around to enjoy it
<The_4th_Wall[Borderl> What's streaming?
<Pegasister16> helps dry Genesic_GaoGaiGar's tears
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> thanks man
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> or woman.
<Thunderpony> Unless he's like Light Yagami, in which case i jump for joy and laugh.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> whatever
<prince-dari> GaoGaiGar is The_4th_Wall[Borderl
<Pegasister16> I'm a girl; and you're welcome.
<otakon> um waht happened?
<Morty> *whispers* gagagagagagaugaigar
<Meanwhile> I liked Yagami.
<otakon> WHAT DID I miss?!
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> Otakon
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> you're back just in time
<mario_pony> it's wed it happened whith that veemi.com live
<Thunderpony> I thought he was a prick, an awesome prick, still a prick.
<Meanwhile> Did you see scissor formation otakon?
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> to see the last episode
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> the one with the MOST AWESOME SCENE
<Moonlight> Is this the intro?
<Midnight_Tempest> EVERYONE DIED! otakon
<otakon> I'm sorry, I'm kind of balancng between 3 streams atm
<otakon> gods
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> yes, it's the intro
<Thunderpony> Just like in akira
<Thunderpony> THe anime movie not the manga
<emantrollslayer> otakon: whichens?
<Moonlight> alright thank you
<otakon> Shy's and Derm's
<emantrollslayer> I think it was Kira
<Moonlight> I thought I missed the whole thing
<Meanwhile> Why does the robot have hair?
<Midnight_Tempest> akira is amazing movie... i have the VHS on the table behind me
<otakon> bc
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01FINAL of FINAL
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> it's not hair
<Moonlight> Because its anime
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01they're energy cables
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> they're energy cylinders
<Meanwhile> FE.
<Moonlight> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> the same kind that Gai has in his cyborg form
<Lasharus|Robotnik> I found Akira somewhat disturbing Midnight_Tempest :P
<Thunderpony> Grunt with each word
<Pegasister16> lol
<Thunderpony> It makes you resist more!
<Meanwhile> His power comes from his hair. Blatently.
<mario_pony> why did they switch to veemi.com
<prince-dari> Oh shit
<Pegasister16> Like Bayonetta?
<prince-dari> Courage = power
<Moonlight> Bc people were complaining
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01because mips was giving trouble
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> no
<Midnight_Tempest> Lasharus|Robotnik I did too but I watched it when I was 7... when I saw it again, it was the greatest movie evah
<Thunderpony> Bayonetta is a witch...her power comes from her sold soul
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> his power comes from his his courage
<Thunderpony> Her hair is just a conduit
<Meanwhile> Wait Bayonetta has hair power?
<Kencolt> Ah, Japanese technobabble.. up there with Star Trek.
<mario_pony> man i can't see anything veemi.com makes my internet all slow!
<Thunderpony> Yeah, she uses it to summon demons from hell to eat angels
<Meanwhile> I assumed from the game box art that she shot people.
<Pegasister16> Conduit? (sorry, I'm a little bit on the dumb side. lol)
<Thunderpony> She does
<Moonlight> BOOM!
<Meanwhile> I really missed the point of that game from the box didn't I.
<Lasharus|Robotnik> I watched it only a year ago or so Midnight_Tempest. I just can't stand organics (dunno why, they just make me nauseous), and the final scenes didn't help there, I'm sure you'll agree. :p
<Meanwhile> Conduit, like a pipe.
<mario_pony> mips worked so well with my internet
<Meanwhile> Though not in a literal sense
<Meanwhile> Things travel through conduits
<Thunderpony> I heard they're making a bayonetta two
<LadyCanary> Really?
<Thunderpony> Not sure if it's a more than a rumor though
<Pegasister16> I did, too!
<Pegasister16> :O
<Meanwhile> Never played 1.
<emantrollslayer> Thunderpony: you spelled Copout wrong
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> now they're showing who's boss
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> GENTLEMEN
<Midnight_Tempest> Lasharus|Robotnik I get that, the last scenes gave me nightmares when i was younger... but that's what happens when you try to force evolution :D
<Thunderpony> Stop correcting me on words i don't say!
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> BURN THAT INTO YOUR EYES AND HEARTS
<Pegasister16> lol
<Meanwhile> And now the robots go topless.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> she's a lady
<emantrollslayer> Midnight_Tempest: last scene of what?
<Meanwhile> How very...peculiar.
<Pegasister16> Eeyup.
<Moonlight> KABLAM!
<CriticKitten> "Forgive me for going topless." Dat....wut
<prince-dari> Explosions made of win don't hurt you
<emantrollslayer> Thunderpony: its what everyone was thinking
<Morty> "excuse me for going topless"
<Midnight_Tempest> akira emantrollslayer
*emantrollslayer doesnt know waht that is
<Midnight_Tempest> >_<
<Meanwhile> Now maybe the dual guy robot can go trouserless just to really drive the point home.
<Midnight_Tempest> your dead to me emantrollslayer...
<emantrollslayer> ;___;
<Thunderpony> Yes
<otakon> okay, Bee Chick is nippley
<Moonlight> I still like you emantrollslayer ,#
<mario_pony> are you gonna go back to mips after this?
<Moonlight> <3
<Meanwhile> I hope not. mips sucks.

*Meanwhile does not simply walk into italics.

<Meanwhile> That's all you need.
<RaveBrony> They need a brohoof AND and AJ icon
<emantrollslayer> Midnight_Tempest: those two words dont go together
<Thunderpony> LIKE A SPOILED CHILD I WANT MORE!
<Meanwhile> /)^3^(\
<Meanwhile> Your argument is invalid.
<Midnight_Tempest> emantrollslayer: of course they do, maybe not often but they can still go together

<Thunderpony> bay blade\
<Moonlight> just one letter off
<RaveBrony> ^^^
<emantrollslayer> Thunderpony: ax smash attack
<Thunderpony> WAIT A SECOND
<Kencolt> We're watching very large robots beat the crap out of each other. That's what we're watching, and that's all we really need to know.
<RaveBrony> So...tomorrow can we get some drawings on the stream?
<Moonlight> ROCK TIME!
<moop> wut?
<RaveBrony> :)
<Thunderpony> I remember seeing this scene somewhere
<CriticKitten> ....
<Pegasister16> <--- LOL
<LadyCanary> Destroying enemies with the power of RAWRK
<Banditen> If I ever get epilepsy I will blame this show
<CriticKitten> Suddenly, the power of music

<prince-dari> Pegasus: Most of us here are bronies
<Pegasus> I!@
<Moonlight> DUH DUH DUH

<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> oh shi
<Thunderpony> Most?
<RaveBrony> :S
<Thunderpony> You mean all?
<Pegasus> I I I I I I
<Banditen> I
<prince-dari> Thunderpony: Not all, Genesic_GaoGaiGar isn't a brony.
<moop> Meanwhile: im not even gonnask what that is..... okay what is that?
<RaveBrony> :o
<Thunderpony> O.O
<Meanwhile> I always figured Bronies wasn't a gender specific term.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> I'm here for the robots :V
<Meanwhile> Despite the bro inclination.
<CriticKitten> Oh my god!
<prince-dari> It's not gender specific IMO too Meanwhile.
<CriticKitten> xD
<Pegasister16> Orlly? Is Genesic_GaoGaiGar a unicousin?
<LadyCanary> GOD MY OH
<otakon> MIC NO!
<moop> doesn't brony refer to /b/?
<Pegasus> WHO LIKES ICE CREAM SAY I;)
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01VOLFOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG
<LadyCanary> ....
<Moonlight> I
<Midnight_Tempest> boom headshot
<Pegasister16> I
<Meanwhile> moop: symmetrical docking is what happens when two giant robots love each other in a special way...
<Banditen> no, brony is bro-pony
<LadyCanary> Nooooooooooo
<RaveBrony> Im here, becuz im here everyday O.o.... dont have a clue whats going on on the stream :D
<Moonlight> I had it today
<otakon> and then they were all killed an overpowered
<moop> because bronys started on 4 chan
<otakon> well this sucks
<moop> so /b/ bronies?
<otakon> and my chat is derping hard
<Morty> :O
<RaveBrony> :O O_o
<Morty> VOOOLFOOOOGGGG
<moop> Meanwhile: gross
<Midnight_Tempest> then everyone died
<Meanwhile> moop: mhmm.
<Banditen> they usually call themselves /b/ronies
<Kencolt> Brony. A pormanteau of "bro" and "pony". Used to describe adult fans of MLP:FiM. Although not technically gender specific, many female Bronies use the term Pegasister instead.
<otakon> and were gonna see ALL of them die now
<otakon> this sucks
<Meanwhile> Oh wow they got chainbladed.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> dudes
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> get ready
<Pegasister16> Kencolt: Eeyup.
<otakon> HOW!?:
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> because tears will be shed
<Thunderpony> If they have a sword that's also a gun i will be happy
<otakon> they're getting SLAUGHTERED
<Moonlight> GREAT MORE CASUALTIES!!
<moop> Kencolt: what if u are a teen boes that not make u a brony?
<emantrollslayer> Kencolt: that proper use of pormanteau
<LadyCanary> D:
<Meanwhile> Man that isn't even a fight.
<Pegasus> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENOPE
<RaveBrony> O_o
<otakon> ded
<Meanwhile> They're all basically bread in a toaster.
<Midnight_Tempest> EVERYONE IS DEAD!
<otakon> all ded
<Meanwhile> My robots are deeeeeaaaaad
<otakon> even Jder
<Moonlight> DAMNIT!
<otakon> EVEN J DER!
<otakon> DAMN IT ALL!
<Banditen> liquid toast
<Kencolt> Teens a Bronies too. THey just aren't fully matures, really. More colts or Fillies than Stallions or Mares.
<Pegasister16> They were so ugly that EVERYONE died! The end.
<Meanwhile> ^
<Pegasus> my pizza is dead
<Thunderpony> I want to strangle that little girl
<RaveBrony> ._.
<Banditen> Stallion right here
<Thunderpony> I just don't know why
<moop> do you have to be 18 to be a brony?
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01I don't blame you
<Moonlight> that's horrible
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01so do I
<Thunderpony> No
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01but I'm still wondering if it's a girl or a trap
<Thunderpony> Just a fan of the show
<Pegasister16> FILLY! :$
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> it's a boy
<Meanwhile> That little girl is infinitely more annoying because she's a child.
<Pegasus> they were so ugly EVERYONE LIVED
<otakon> it's a trap either way
<Meanwhile> If she were grown she'd come across less like a douche.
<otakon> and then the entire team was slaughtered
<Moonlight> he has freaky face
<TopHat> Pegasister16, Pegasus, your names are confusing the crap out of me
<Thunderpony> If boy it's a shota trap, if it's a girl it's a loli which is a trap in it's own right
<RaveBrony> :o
<otakon> well thats it
<otakon> they lost
<Banditen> And then they hade tea. With biscuits.
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> Otakon
<Kencolt> The acid test is if you find yourself annoyed because the Celestia toys are pink and they never give AJ her hat. If that's the case, it's pure Bronyhood.
<Meanwhile> I do love tea.
<Pegasister16> Pegasus: Na-ah! I just said that everyone DIED! :[
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> have you lost hope?
<Moonlight> They are all fucked now
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> so?
<Meanwhile> Not really. The good guys usually win.
<Pegasus> how is my name confusing?:'(
<otakon> um
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> as long as one has courage, one can keep fighting
<otakon> yeha
<otakon> all dead
<Banditen> eeyup. And then they hade tea. With biscuits.
<Midnight_Tempest> the end
<Meanwhile> Though tbh I'm not emotionally invested in this enough to care who wins.
<otakon> Genesic_GaoGaiGar: EVERYONE ELSE HAS BEEN TORN TO BITS!
<Thunderpony> 4th wall has been broken
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> SO WHAT?
<Pegasister16> Pegasus: Pegasus, Pegasister. They sound similiar.
<otakon> um
<Moonlight> YEAH
<otakon> bits are bits
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> AS LONG AS WE HAVE VOURAGE
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> COURAGE*
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> WE CAN KEEP FIGHTING
<Thunderpony> Pegsus, Pegasi, Pegasister
<Meanwhile> Vourage will see us through.
<Banditen> Pegasisters are bronies too!
<otakon> we know
<Banditen> :D
<Pegasister16> Eeyup.
<Kencolt> Ibelieve I just said that...

<emangamer> Pegasus: just dont say it so loud... KoutarouTaiga is starting to get mad at all the people saying that....
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Guys, be nice.
<LadyCanary> To each their own opinion, but if you dont like it, then dont watch it. No use complaining.
<Moonlight> Hello Honey_Whistle
<Lasharus|Robotnik> There's really no need to swear at others.
<emangamer> LadyCanary: IKR?
<Lasharus|Robotnik> But, as LadyCanary just point out rightly, there's also no point in complaining.
<Pegasus> no it's fine....
<Honey_Whistle> Now I've got a lot more ponies on the job.
<Meanwhile> Weird self rebuildingguy sure is taking a pouding.
<emangamer> so KoutarouTaiga is HE a god, or is his mech just really fucking powerful?
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> his mech is just powerful
<Thunderpony> Why do so many bad guys like to claim they're gods? I've seen countless bad guys do it and they all die after doing it
<Banditen> I don't care much for this show either. I'm here for the awesome ponyfolks
<Moonlight> his mech is just too epic
<KoutarouTaiga> 09,01Genesic GaoGaiGar is said to be the God of Destruction
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> and he has this fantasy that he's a god because he can regenerate forever
<prince-dari> Well being immortal
<LadyCanary> ...NOOOOOOOOOOO D:
<Moonlight> NNNNOOOOOOOOOO
<Meanwhile> Fairly decent fantasy tbh
<prince-dari> You might as well be a God.
<Pegasister16> Tarku: OMG! Those pics were soo CUTE! :$
<Moonlight> oh a twist
<Meanwhile> Dat British line of thinking dari.
<Thunderpony> I'd say thats a curse rather than godhood
<Phase4> so this is what, the 5th time he's exploded?
<emangamer> KoutarouTaiga: so what happens when two people with G-Stones who are both full of courage fight each other?
<Lasharus|Robotnik> Nah nah KoutarouTaiga - that's Chaos. (Yes, Sonic Adventure reference :P)
<Banditen> starscream?
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> emangamer: they don't
<Meanwhile> Did he briefly become a blue cactuar?
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> they bro up
<mario_pony> but doesn't being immortal mean you live foreever but can still die?
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> NOW
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<emangamer> Genesic_GaoGaiGar: in hypothetical situation land, what would happen
<prince-dari> They do die
<Genesic_GaoGaiGar> IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE END
<Pegasus> THE POWER OF THE G-STONE....GRANDS COURAGE...AND MAKES FLUTTERSHY CRY:'(

<RAWRity> emangamer: it's kinda my job to piss him off at this point. Why do you think I made that casting choice to begin with?
<Meanwhile> It's because I'm usually like this and I'm not in the mood to restrain myself.
<prince-dari> Seems kind of out of character for you

<Meanwhile> No, but it did make me feel a bit sick.
<emangamer> Meanwhile: how so?
<MahBoi777> ?
<Meanwhile> And my My Little Dashie is, as always, boring.
<emangamer> :O
<RAWRity> you know what we need? We need one of the streamers to stream the Star Wars: Clone Wars mini-series that Genddy Tartakovsky did.

<emangamer> Pegasister16: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-sunset.html
*RAWRity also didn't find MLD to be anything special. Felt like somebody took "Where The Red Fern Grows", abridged it, and put ponies in.
<moop> moop: no they have more to cuddle up against
<emangamer> but, HEY, for some reason I'm a sucker for fics where twilight tries to overthrow celestia...

<Meanwhile> Yeah see, I'm reading the 2nd story, that's the one that made me feel ill.
<RAWRity> meh, MLD just struck me as the guy taking every trope he could from other sad "giving up your pet" stories in an attempt to make people sad through remembering THOSE stories.
<emangamer> what do you mean "2nd story"
<Meanwhile> You missed the For Want of a Dawn bit?
<Meanwhile> It's on 15 chapters already
<emangamer> RAWRity: I have never read any of those stores and yet I still balled my eyes out
<emangamer> For Want of a Dawn?
<MahBoi777> I thought MLD was touching, but hey, that's just my opinion, may not be for everyone
<moop> whats MLD?
<Meanwhile> emangamer: it's on the same page you just linked

<Meanwhile> Oh for fudge sake I broke a nail.
<Meanwhile> Now it's really uncomfortable.

<otakon> emangamer: sorry, it was the only one I could find
<Meanwhile> Last thing I saw was trixie hate
<MahBoi777> mario_pony ate a mushroom
<Meanwhile> And I agree
<emangamer> moop: dont read MLD then
<Meanwhile> Trixie should be eaten by Timberwolves.
<emangamer> Meanwhile: good, cuz she deserves hate
<moop> im reading it right now just started
<otakon> um
<MahBoi777> moop: ikr? lol

<Meanwhile> At last we can agree on something.
<otakon> she could change
<Meanwhile> Or she could be devoured.
<Meanwhile> I prefer that
<emangamer> moop: I feel bad for you
<otakon> SHE COULD CHANGE
<emangamer> otakon: no she can't
<MahBoi777> I hate Gilda more than Trixie
<otakon> why can't you give her a chance?
<emangamer> its completly against her character
<Meanwhile> Because she's a bitch.
<mario_pony> manly tears will be shed.
<Meanwhile> Why should she have a chance.
<otakon> ummm
<otakon> but ponies CHANGE
<emangamer> Fandom Trixie is completely different from show Trixie.
<otakon> yh
<Meanwhile> people don't change otakon.
<emangamer> show trixie = bitch
<otakon> that's true
<emangamer> fandom trixie =....IDK what
<otakon> Meanwhile: do so
<Meanwhile> Do not.
<otakon> do so
<Phase4> emangamer: many things
<Meanwhile> Do not infinity.
*RAWRity really doesn't get the rabid trixie hate.
<Phase4> ^
<otakon> DOES SO TIMES THE UNIVERSE!
*Meanwhile really doesn't get the equally rabid Trixie love.
<emangamer> ok how about this THE WORST PONY EVER is ....... ugh TWIST....dumb bitch
<Phase4> another trixie episode would be good
<MahBoi777> Gilda<Trixie, just saiyan
<Meanwhile> Yeah ok that's just weird eman.
<otakon> emangamer: why the hate for the pony with a speech impediment?
<emangamer> MahBoi777: no the only thing <Trixie is..... Twist
<otakon> she has a lisp
<otakon> that is NO reason to hate
<RAWRity> I mean, she's not the most agreeable of personalities, but she serve her purpose as a character without ever doing anything all that despicable.
<emangamer> otakon: It's not the impediment....I ust dont like her. stupid termagent
<otakon> it's like hating Derpy for her eyes
<MahBoi777> Trixie is Twist?
<Meanwhile> But she's such a bucking douchewad
<otakon> termagent?
<emangamer> otakon: fancy word for a bitch
*RAWRity REALLY doesn't get the Twist hate. SHE'S ADORABLE!
<emangamer> RAWRity: NO, bad RAWRity
<Phase4> ^^^
<otakon> emangamer: do you mean Twisp or Trixie?
<emangamer> SCOORE...dat ninja
<Meanwhile> She's like some goober who kicked a puppy, and everyone saw that they kicked a puppy, yet seem willing to look past that because...I don't even know.
<emangamer> otakon: I mean Twist
<otakon> emangamer: WHY!?
<MahBoi777> so much hate, lol
*kirzstryfe delurks and noms on otakon
<otakon> noes!
<Meanwhile> Really, the only people who I can fathom liking Trixie are people who like being kicked in the crotch during sex.
<emangamer> otakon: because she is a stupid termagent who doesn't deserve my love
<Phase4> emangamer: did my ^^^ show up under your comment on your screen?
*emangamer glomps kirzstryfe
<emangamer> Phase4: yes
*otakon tosses off kirzstryfe towards emangamer
<Phase4> emangamer: :(
*emangamer takes kirzstryfe for his own
<otakon> um
<otakon> WHY?
<Phase4> ohai kirzstryfe
<emangamer> otakon: what?
<otakon> she's done NOTHING to deserve hate
<MahBoi777> hi kirzstryfe
<otakon> NOTHING
<MahBoi777> otakon: I agree
<emangamer> otakon: IDK why I hate her, shes just a bitch and I hate nothign moer than her
<otakon> um
<otakon> HOW?!?
<RAWRity> I really don't understand how being a show-off is tantamount to injuring an innocent puppy.
<otakon> you can't just have unexplained HATE
<mario_pony> @Pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12mario_pony is 6Twilight Spa13rk6le
<emangamer> otakon: yes I can...for example look at me
<otakon> that's the same as saying you HATE the show
<Phase4> emangamer: http://derpy.me/HebFb
<otakon> without even watching it
<emangamer> otakon: no it's not
<otakon> yes it is
<mario_pony> @Pony
<RAWRity> Is being a braggart a good personality traigt? no. Is it deserving of the wish for DISMEMBERMENT? Hell no.
<emangamer> because I saw twist, gave her a chance, and FUCKING hated her
<Midnight_Tempest|BRB> ok... so i remember seeing something about hating Twist? who could hate Twist, she's adorable
<Phase4> @pony http://derpy.me/HebFb
<Steven_Magnet> 6 http://derpy.me/HebFb is 15Sweetie 6Be13ll6e
<Phase4> lol
<otakon> you hate something for the sake of hating her
<otakon> not for any real reason
<Phase4> Steven_Magnet: WRONG!
<mario_pony> noo i is sweety belle!!
<emangamer> otakon: you're not going to dissuade me
<RAWRity> emangamer: and what did you hate about her? What part of her character did you find disagreeable and why?
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: It's just an example. I've read fics with Trixie in and she isn't a complete jerkwad and that's fine. But her actual canon representation is that of the kind of person I have spent my entire life despising. It isn't her actions strictly, it's who she is. I hate her as a person.
<emangamer> she is just a plain old termagent that I do not like
<Meanwhile> I literally hate her being.
<Phase4> Meanwhile: ...wow
<Phase4> i supose thats the best reason for hating someone but still... wow
<emangamer> do I need ANY other reason to hate her? just look at this comic and tell me she isn't a termagent: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZhXaND3vtAw/TlGVD87wpgI/AAAAAAAAK1I/yjPmuMjEI9Y/s1600/1313961409.kturtle_iygaparc10t.jpg

<Dashie_Dashie> Yay for pictures! :3
<Dashie_Dashie> http://i.imgur.com/atqBL.jpg
<Stallion_of_War> Mars is the Roman version of Ares
<emangamer> TopHat: I hate you
<MahBoi777> and then came Kratos the pony
<Phase4> quadruped'
<otakon> IIRC Roman's just converted the Greek gods
<LadyCanary> Dat Dashie_Dashie.
<Dashie_Dashie> :3
<Meanwhile> Yes one is Greek one is roman but they both represent the same deity
<emangamer> otakon: correct sir :)
<Stallion_of_War> Jupiter=Zeus, Mars=Ares
<otakon> ah thank you
<Stallion_of_War> etc etc.
<TOY_PON3> Hey LadyCanary
<LadyCanary> Hihi~
<MahBoi777> Dashie_Dashie: AAAAAAUGH
<Meanwhile> Ares is a reinterpretation by Romans.
<Meanwhile> No
<TOY_PON3> Dashie_Dashie: Dat eyebrow raise
<RAWRity> Stallion_of_War: actually, the Romans and the Greeks had very different interpretations of the gods. while Poseidon was a big deity in Greece, Neptune was considered unlucky and mostly ignored by the less navally inclined romans.
<TOY_PON3> :3
<Meanwhile> Ares was reinterpreted by romans
<Dashie_Dashie> :D
<mario_pony> hello LadyCanary!!
<Meanwhile> There's a reinterpretation there somewhere
<Stallion_of_War> close enough...
<Meanwhile> Heya LadyCanary.
<MahBoi777> hi LadyCanary!
<Stallion_of_War> I was referencing GoW anyhow...
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm here! I'm here!
<emangamer> Stallion_of_War: romans took the greek gods and MODIFIED them, they're not the same. In greek culture Ares was a coward and hated by Hera and Zeus (his parents). in the roman culture Mars was a brave and nobel god who they respected
<Thunderpony> Why is rarity so...snobby, yet she's the spirit of generosity?
<Meanwhile> Out of interest LadyCanary, are you still talking to me?
<LadyCanary> Yes I am ^_^

<RAWRity> While the greek Ares was mostly a smaller god compared to Zues, Poseidon, and Hades, while Mars was a BIG part of Roman culture.
<LadyCanary> I am not going to BED. SHUSH.

<emangamer> LadyCanary: you're welcome <3

<RAWRity> emangamer: not so much a coward, but the type of guy to jump ship when things looked bad.
<Thunderpony> I see a brony
<Meanwhile> For foolishness Everlasting_Joy. For foolishness.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01shines Meanwhile.

<emangamer> LadyCanary: I see your Watchman, and raise you one patrick: http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/dating-fails-dating-fails-now-thats-commitment.jpg
<RAWRity> Thunderpony: Simply put, one of rarity's character flaws is that, while she is generous and giving to her loved ones, she can be easily frustrated at times, and often struggles with the choice of helping her friends or helping herself.
<Meanwhile> Dat raw shark.
<LadyCanary> XD Yes.
<Everlasting_Joy> So many art pieces to look at, so little time.
<TOY_PON3> emangamer: Dats a win

<Meanwhile> That's dedication right there
<LadyCanary> I'm making Valentines for my pals~
<Phase4> i think my chat broke
<Phase4> yup, broke
<emangamer> Thunderpony: told you RAWRity would put yon in your place
<Thunderpony> Oh so she is generous, just a lot of it can go to herself.
<LadyCanary> And one for a special someone >////<
<Meanwhile> If one of you were so ugly that everyone died I probably wouldn't love you anymore.
<emangamer> LadyCanary: do i get one?
<Thunderpony> You said rarity would hold me in a trunk
<emangamer> Meanwhile: because you would be dead
<LadyCanary> NO. But you did give me an idea.
<TOY_PON3> lol
*Stallion_of_War wonders if he should post a picture of his "beard"
<RAWRity> Thunderpony: no, he said I would.
<Meanwhile> True fact, but by deficit, whoever loves them would be dead anyway
*Stallion_of_War if it can be called a beard
<mario_pony> has anypony seen Chronicle?
<emangamer> D: how do I not get a card then LC, I'll make you one if you make me one?
<Thunderpony> I'm not in a trunk
<LordCelestia> 0,5What?
<MahBoi777> Epic Beards
<Thunderpony> So i win!
<RAWRity> emangamer: you get something even better than a card. You get a kick!
<Meanwhile> LadyCanary: I'm sure your crush will love whatever it is you have in mind.
<TOY_PON3> Sudden LCD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I was going to buy MLP Valentines cards for my family.

<Everlasting_Joy> Stallion_of_War oh jeez, yeah. You can even make them.
<Meanwhile> I imagine I won't get anything for Valentines because I live alone and have been shut off from a social circle for about 4 years. Though even when I had people I knew in my life I still didn't get anything.

<Kimori> Its a game store so maybe I can pick up some posters
*LordCelestia hums along
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't tell anymore.
<Meanwhile> RAWRity, you still kicking about?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*anyone
<RAWRity> My mom doesn't know, but I've covertly brought up the subject of Bronies before. She's said it strikes her as "pervy"
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: si
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just let them find out for themselves.
<Dken2021> only people that know are my cousins, and they're only children
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't think "I like ponies." was something you told someone.
<RAWRity> My mom's kind of an idiot like that at times.
<Meanwhile> Did you ever start on that shipfic of my moustache and otakon's beard?
*MahBoi777 is bracing himself for more random pictures
<otakon> no
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - it isn't
<Everlasting_Joy> I've told only one other person.
<otakon> just no
<MirrorImage> you bring it up casually and tangentally
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I did tell my brother after he moved in. That's the only time I told someone.
<LadyCanary> My mom and dad are quite fine with the things I like.
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: no, but I did plan to have it in Mod 4 if I wanted to write it.
<LadyCanary> They dont judge.
<MahBoi777> I only got one person that knows, everyone else has no Idea....well except ya'll
<MirrorImage> my "coming out of the stable" moment involved me inserting a reference to the ending of S2E2 into a converstion that mentioned it was a sin amongst nerds to confuse Star Wars and Star Trek
<Meanwhile> My mum bought me a pony at my request. Whether she knows anything beyond "I wanted a pony doll" I am not privvy to know.
<kyle113> Cool good luck!
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: well, to be fair, it's a little more normal for a female to say she likes MLP than for a male.
<Phase4> ​ ▲
<Phase4> ▲▲
<mario_pony> i've told my hole family and all my friends they don't really care though.
<Phase4> there we go
<MirrorImage> inb4kick
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: You should write that.
<Everlasting_Joy> The only reason I told that one other person is because he's my best friend and I knew he wouldn't riticule me over it.
*Phase4 figured out how to triforce
<LordCelestia> 0,5>_>
<Meanwhile> Your best friend doesn't mock you?
<Everlasting_Joy> Heck, I might have gotten him into it (but I can't tell, I haven't spoken to him since).
<Kimori> thanks
<Kimori> I talked with the manager there already
<MahBoi777> LOL, I just kept showin my friend clips off of youtube and soon he succumbed
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile correct.
<Meanwhile> When I had one he took the piss out of me all the time. And then I punched him in the spine once and made him cry.
<Kimori> he will be able to give me some game logo signs
<Hodiku> I wear my MLP shirts all the time. so far most people have no clue, while ive recieved 3 brohoofs
<kyle113> What did he say?
<Kimori> not sure if ill be able to get anything else
<MirrorImage> "took the..." CONTEXT PLEASE
<Meanwhile> Admittedly, we were like 12.
<MahBoi777> ohai Hodiku
<Hodiku> hola
<Meanwhile> MirrorImage: this is probably a cultural thing rather than a context one. See here that's slang for mocking.
<MirrorImage> yes... cultural indeed
<Meanwhile> Taking the mickey, having you on, pulling your leg.
<Kimori> If youve gone to a gamestop lately, most will have some signs that say xbox or ps3
<Meanwhile> Beating your whisket.
