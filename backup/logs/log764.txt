<Stellafera> These two ponies are BOTH my FAVORITES what do I do
<Ninjazz> Ah yes, the Rarijack flagship episode. I do like this episode.
<Madfish> It's nice the growth the characters have gone through...
<KTKomedy2813> Ladies and Gentlemen, Madame Whinesalot.
<Ross_Pit_shark_hunte> Rarity this is why u arew worst pony
<CrystalPhoenix> Come

<Anon_The_Wizard> MARSHMALLOWS DON'T LIKE WATER!
<DinkyDoo> ITS JUST MUD!
<SpadeMagnes[School> God I hate you rarity
<Jigglysaint> you can put the bench over you, you are an unicorn
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Alright ponies, I'm gonna go play some Skyrim now, Laters
<Jazmyn> i liek mud..

<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeMagnes[School: Rarity is amasing...;)
<Juice> AHHH MUD
<Christian> MUD NO
<Derpy> Who else searches for animation errors:D
<KrazyNoobs> I honesly cannot wait for Season 3 Episode 11, 12 and 13. That one episode sounds exciting, but I won't spoil anything about it.
<Sebiale> WAIT A MINUTE! If ponies can heal trees, why can't they heal broken bones like Big Mac's???
<jbh1145> STFU RARITY HATERS
<ShatteringAmbiance> ohhhh
<GJDS-7> Heavy: RARITY is COWARD
<KTKomedy2813> Magic.
<Stellafera> AJ is best but Rarity is second best, I dunno who I should like
<DinkyDoo> Derpy: I do!
<SpadeMagnes[School> Such a stuck up bitch....
<DocSane> I love this episode (Which is why I chose it)
<twilight_sprinkle> so she just called rarity useless?
<pony_780> ICY SPY
<KrazyNoobs> did applejack just say the five-letter b word?
<tavi_lover> their voices are different
<Sceptileknight> did AJ said bitching?
<VideoWatcher> BURN

<sparkarez> PM!!!!!
<pony_5127> Evil stare
<Pony938> Ohhhhhh
<Kammerjunk> Applejack and Rarity do a good impression of an Internet argument.
<magmablock> Infinity + 1 is still infinity
<jbh1145> IFINITY + 1=UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<wipergone2> fluttershy
<Blaze> Infinity + 1 .....WHAT?
<abrony> internet arguments
<pony_5127> Flutteershy
<cowvarkian> AJfan77: spike is best pone
<OohShiny> shipping Rarijack started in this episode
<haseo348> PINKIE MY FAVE
<DocSane> I like how this show handles dealing with "friends" who have little in common.
<Derpyshy> infinity is nothing
<Zamer> Staring Contest ‚àû+1 GO
<Kammerjunk> They almost nailed it, but they failed on the whole "leave it behind" thing.
<One> aww lovers spat
<KrazyNoobs> so much regret
<OohShiny> flys out
<Madfish> Because unlike Fluttershy, Big Mac isn't a tree
<SirDusky> Rarity sounded different in season 1...
<Ponymon> Wow, anyone notice the difference between AJ's voice then and her voice now?
<Juice> Pinkie is my favorite pony
<Felix> Applejack sure is a dynamite gal.
<tavi_lover> back away slowly
<Skandranon> shipping
<Zamer> first to blink loses
<meleeman> infinity + infinity x infinity
<Anubisette> my queen, her royal highness, Fluttershy
<SpadeMagnes[School> How are these 6 friends again?
<GJDS-7> Spy:No I think not
<Sceptileknight> rainbow dash: it needs to be 20% cooler
