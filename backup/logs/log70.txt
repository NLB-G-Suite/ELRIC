<Ghosties> Filtered, homogenized "fun"
<Sathi> 7to broadcast here yes
<Denied_Existence> Nittany_Tiger, I totally thought you meant something else
<ReticentSmolder_> oooooooooooh, you mean start my own room and get you guys in on it you mean?
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh.
<Sathi> 7yes
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah, I can do that.
<ReticentSmolder_> although I have no idea how Veemi works :(
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm playing Beat Hazard right now, so if you want to see me play BC2 tonight, I may be a while.
<Ghosties> You know what the really fucked up thing in all this is? I actually see your point, I see where you're coming from but I just don't think it's fair to a good viewer to have to be quieted because of a few other assholes.
<Sathi> 7I shall PM you ReticentSmolder_
<drf|laptop> 03just bought my IRL friend Left 4 Dead (the first one) for 8 bucks
<drf|laptop> 03so we can play together XD
<Hipster_Brony> there are plenty of places for them to discuss those things
<SirSprinkles> 6Ghosties, I know that feel, but unfortunately that's how modding tends to work.
<Hipster_Brony> but not everyone here likes it
<ReticentSmolder_> new Fallout Equestria posted while I was gone? http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/original/130101172652.png
<Hipster_Brony> and we have to act in the best interests of everyone
<Ghosties> How do we know what the viewer's best interests are?
<Ghosties> We haven't asked them
<Hipster_Brony> i can safely assume that most of our viewers dont enjoy shitstorms over religion
<Ghosties> Assume
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Off to watch something bbs
<Hipster_Brony> thats what we do
<Hipster_Brony> as mods
<Hipster_Brony> thats the job
<Denied_Existence> What is this from?
<Ghosties> Do you at least see why I'm so pissed, Hipster?
<Ghosties> Do you see why I hate that rule?
<prince-dari> I don't care what viewers think.
<Hipster_Brony> if we asked everyone about every decision we make, nothing would ever get done
<prince-dari> Those topics are bad for discussion.
<SirSprinkles> 6Pocahontas
<S2D> ffffuuuuu
<Hipster_Brony> ghosties: honestly, not really
<Ghosties> At least you're honest
<Hipster_Brony> it sounds "freedom for the sake of freedom" to me
<Hipster_Brony> even when it isnt in the best interests of our viewers or the event
<Denied_Existence> I suddenly crave some gold...
<Ghosties> I hear "punishing all for the mistakes of the few"
<Hipster_Brony> but do you know what?
<Sathi> If I may add something?
<Ghosties> What Sathi?
<Hipster_Brony> if the chat turns into a shitstorm, they're gonna be even more upset than they will be by not talking about it at all
<Hipster_Brony> of course sathi
<Sathi> For this entire discussion we have the last rule on the draft
<Sathi> I say put leave the drama outside
<Drake> 04o-o
<Ghosties> Yes
<Ghosties> Yes
<Ghosties> I completely agree with that
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<Ghosties> That's what I wanted to see
<Denied_Existence> There is a news anchor on the network I am watching with a giant pair of scissors...
<Hipster_Brony> that is very open to misinterpretation though
<Sathi> Still it gives us freedom
<Ghosties> You're assuming that people won't know what it means
<Sathi> to do what's right
<Ghosties> You're assuming, and you're undermining our judgment
<Hipster_Brony> im assuming people will try and use it as a loophole
<ReticentSmolder_> Hey, if, and I mean *IF* I can get a livestream of Silent Hill 2, would any of you guys want to see it?
<ReticentSmolder_> er, not 2, the movie from 06
<Hipster_Brony> "oh i brought up cupcakes and derailed chat with it, but i wasnt TRYING to stat drama"
<Hipster_Brony> start*
<Ghosties> That's an obvious troll, you kick his ass. If you can't see a fucking troll, then why mod?
<Sathi> We need to agree on these rules as a team
<Denied_Existence> I have seen it a good bit, but I might watch it I can never seem to catch the first half-hour.
<Ghosties> That statement of the rule grossly undermines our abilities to appropriately judge and rule
<ReticentSmolder_> yeah, I'm seeing if I can fiddle with livestream stuff, I don't know how to make it NOT my entire monitor hehe
<Hipster_Brony> its for the sake of clarity
<Ghosties> It feels like you are telling me "I don't trust your ability to mod, therefore, I'm going to tell you what to look for"
<Sathi> 7get the program
<Denied_Existence> Well...that won't be to terrible as long as you use a player with full screen options
<Hipster_Brony> no, thats not what im saying at all
<Sathi> 7you can choose what to view and what not
<Ghosties> That's honestly how it comes off to me
<Hipster_Brony> its for the viewers
<Sathi> 7even can zoom in and what not
<Hipster_Brony> i give those as examples of topics to avoid because they ALWAYS turn into shitstorms
<Ghosties> So, you're saying, that no one can dare utter the word "Christianity" or "Barack Obama"
<prince-dari> ...
<Ziltoid> no u
<Polarfire> ohai dari
<SirSprinkles> 6Try "Please leave all drama at the door. This is intended to be a fun and inclusive event, so please avoid the discussion of controversial topics such as politics, religion, "Cupcakes", furries, and other topics not mentioned here."
<Ziltoid> whats with egg face anyway?
<prince-dari> My router exploded.
<Sathi> nah
<Polarfire> XD
<Ghosties> I like Sathi's better
<Sathi> too much info
<Sathi> keep it simple
<Sathi> KiS
*drf|laptop plays Mario party 2
<Hipster_Brony> >mfw thats pretty much exactly what i wrote
<Denied_Existence> Egg...face...egg-face...egg face...eggface?
<Ghosties> It really is what Hipster wrote
<Sathi> yep ;)
<Ghosties> You just left out a line
<SirSprinkles> 6I took out some to make it seem less strict.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's the same basic idea though.
<Ghosties> Sathi's wording is best
<Hipster_Brony> i want to give examples so people know what we're talking about
<Ghosties> It gets the point across
<Ghosties> Then just leave Cupcakes
<Ghosties> It relates to the fandom, after all
<Hipster_Brony> then it looks like we're singling out Cupcakes though
<Ghosties> But it's still an example
<Ghosties> And it relates to the fandom
<Sathi> 7I missed... that pic
<drf|laptop> 03Frick I lost this minigame >_>
<Ghosties> It tells them "leave the drama at the door"
<Ghosties> And really
<Ghosties> It's almost always about cupcakes
<Hipster_Brony> only half of them have been about cupcakes, from what i remember
<Denied_Existence> Then here it is again:http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
<Denied_Existence> INSTANT REPLAY
<Ghosties> I've only ever seen people tell others to stop talking about Cupcakes
<Sathi> 7thank you!
<Aurora> lol
<Ziltoid> you got the power!?!?!
<Sathi> 7I do?
<Hipster_Brony> there was one about furries before for sure
<Ziltoid> yes
<Hipster_Brony> one about religion (during monty python IIRC)
<Ghosties> Like I said, it's an example, it gets the point across, it's relateable, and it makes up for most of the controversial topics that I've seen discussed; it's a good example
<Ziltoid> the power of frienship
<Sathi> imho try to keep the rules simple and easy to read.. no need to use examples for everything
<Hipster_Brony> but like i said, then it looks like we're singling out Cupcakes
<Sathi> if people have questions they will ask
<Hipster_Brony> and people will assume it's a "dont talk about Cupcakes" rule
<Ghosties> IMO, I'd rather single out Cupcakes then religion or politics
<Polarfire> also the power of op-ness now. Congrats to you and rainbro!
<Hipster_Brony> and forget that it includes other things
<Hipster_Brony> if we list multiple things, it doesnt single them out though
<Ghosties> Then keep it related to the fandom
<Sathi> 7hihi thanks
<Polarfire> I forgot to say it earlier when it was announced...
<Denied_Existence> Enlighten me of this mystical op...
<NightSeas> 12Heya Aurora
<Ghosties> Things that relate to our demographic
<Ziltoid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYX1HzRiIpM
<Polarfire> mod
<Polarfire> basically. half-op's can't ban i think? and full operators can.
<Aurora> hi
<Sathi> 7it means I have the "banhammer"
<Denied_Existence> Ah, operator
<Sathi> 7*swings around with it*
<Polarfire> and admin is one step above that.
<Sathi> 7see?
*Polarfire gets hit.
*Denied_Existence Ducks under the hammer
<Polarfire> ow
<Kosoveon> hi rora
<Ziltoid> how does one emote?
*Sathi 7runs to Polarfire and hugs him tight
<Denied_Existence> type: /me
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 7Hitmontop.
*Ziltoid destroys the universe
<Polarfire> thanks sathi :D
<Sathi> 7will you rebuild it?
<Ziltoid> I can only destroy
<Aurora> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Aurora, you are a 4Rapidash.
<Aurora> 6k
<HyperMetalLugia> blah
<Sathi> 7My mother always told me.. whatever you destroy needs to be rebuild
<NightSeas> 12!Pokemon
<ScriptBot> NightSeas, you are a 6Turtwig.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL I hate when the CPU players use items like the lamp that takes you to the star
<Ziltoid> your mother lied
<NightSeas> 12:3
<Denied_Existence> CUTIE MARK CRUSADER UNIVERSE BUILDERS GO!
<drf|laptop> 03LOL Turdwig
<Polarfire> XD
<Polarfire> oh shoot
<Denied_Existence> I am sorry, I saw the opening and went for it
<HyperMetalLugia> Hah
<Ziltoid> this song
<Polarfire> ... we're screwed
<Denied_Existence> MUAHAHAHA
<Hipster_Brony> problem is though, conversation doesnt always stay limited to the fandom
<Polarfire> I'm supposed to be doing something for school right now... fcuk der poleic.
<Polarfire> :P
<Ziltoid> perhaps I can help
<Denied_Existence> FUCK DA....lost my train of thought
<Polarfire> ha.
<Ghosties> I know it doesn't, but if we put up examples that relate to the fandom that cause drama then it doesn't single out one particular thing, it's multiple examples, and it gets the point across to not stir shit up
*Denied_Existence flings himself off a cliff
<Ziltoid> who plays this song?
<Polarfire> sprinkles apparently.
<Ziltoid> no imean teh artist
<Polarfire> oh.
*Denied_Existence yells, his voice almost being lost in the wind, "WEEEEEEE, THIS IS AWESOME!"
<Hipster_Brony> ok, name another controversial part of the fandom we're going to ban
<Polarfire> nooo!
<Ziltoid> the acid polka has arrived
*Polarfire runs to the edge of the cliff with a fishing pole
*Polarfire casts over the edge hoping to catch DE
<Ghosties> Syrup
<Ghosties> pony menstruation blood
*Denied_Existence lands in the water, after doing a perfect swan dive, then is pulled out by Polarfire.
<Hipster_Brony> thats not controversial though, just gross and kind of funny
<Polarfire> igotchabro
<Hipster_Brony> i wouldnt want to ban it tbh
<Ghosties> And Cupcakes is also "gross" and "kind of funny"
<Denied_Existence> Dammit Polar! I was just cliff diving!
<Dashite> You got him alright. Looks like the hook went right through his cheek.
<Polarfire> oh.
*Polarfire cuts line
<Denied_Existence> I guess you....
*Denied_Existence puts on sunglasses
<RainBroDash> >mfw cupcakes is kind of funny
<Hipster_Brony> its very offensive to a lot of people though
<Polarfire> o god...
<Ghosties> It really is
<Ghosties> funny, that is
<Hipster_Brony> myself included
<RainBroDash> get out :P
<Denied_Existence> took my red herring
<Ghosties> Why is it offensive? Because it's gore?
<Denied_Existence> YEEEEAAAAH
<Polarfire> *facehoof*
<Ghosties> Syrup is goddamn pony menstruation blood for fuck's sakes
<Hipster_Brony> ghosties, a large population of the fanbase HATES cupcakes
<Ghosties> That's okay, but gore isn't?
<Denied_Existence> Dammit, I fucked up my grammar on that line....
<Hipster_Brony> i dont know of anyone that HATES syrup
<Denied_Existence> Oh well.
<eXAKR> Morning
<Ghosties> hate=/=controversial though
<Ghosties> People hate Hitler
<Ghosties> Our hate of Hitler is not controversial
<SirSprinkles> 6Um... it kinda is Ghosties.
<Sathi> if I had the banhammer yesterday I would have insta banned the sieg hail guy...
<Ghosties> Dude, are you telling me I can't hate Hitler?
<Hipster_Brony> and godwins law has been fulfilled now
<SirSprinkles> 6Not at all.
<Ghosties> That's another thing, I liked Hitler in here
<Ghosties> He was funny
<ReticentSmolder_> hey, you know that part about me...and the Silent Hill movie, and me streaming it? its true
<Aeroslash> evening
<Denied_Existence> NO WAY!
<Denied_Existence> GIBT MIR DIEN LINK
<Sathi> 7with help :P
<Ghosties> Look, Hipster, you can try to act however you want, all I'm saying is, just don't include religion and politics. It's assuming, insulting, and I feel like it undermines the mods abilities. Most importantly, it's just so restrictive.
<ClockworkPie> Everypony chill the fuck out, im still alive!
<ReticentSmolder_> yes, with much help, I dunno if I'm allowed to use this chat room or not? anywho, I can pm anyone who wants to link
<Ziltoid> OH OGD IM SO RELIEVED
<Ghosties> I am asking you as a person
<Ghosties> From one person to another
<Ghosties> Don't include it, please
*Denied_Existence pokes ClockworkPie with a stick, just to be sure.
<ClockworkPie> oww~
<SoiPony> no way
<Sathi> 7use the PM's pls ;)
*Denied_Existence pokes ClockworkPie again.
<eXAKR> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hNQwbALMqTo/TjRsXnlLQDI/AAAAAAAAJfE/EUrK0PRYtuE/s1600/Clipboard01.jpg <- Why do I want this? oO;
<ClockworkPie> owww~, pls stop it hurts
<HyperMetalLugia> To be your inner female
*HyperMetalLugia nods
<LL-XBL> 12ogawd
<LL-XBL> 12if eXAKR has an inner female
*eXAKR slaps HyperMetalLugia around a bit with a large Bendy Bus
*Denied_Existence backs away, slowly...
*LL-XBL 12mind asploded
<Hipster_Brony> >mfw putting in a rule about not causing drama started a ton of drama
<ReticentSmolder_> so umm, if you wanna see silent hill, (unofficially and all), I can pm you the link to me stream
<Polarfire> reticentSmolder_ I'll check it out if you don't mind.
<ClockworkPie> thats right ya better back away
<eXAKR> I once read on some spirtual site somewhere that everyone has a male and female soul within him/her
<Hipster_Brony> problem is ghosties, those are the two most divisive topics out there
*Denied_Existence quietly loads his revolver.
<eXAKR> if that's true I think the female part of my soul is... expressive
<Hipster_Brony> nothing good can come from having discussion of them
<Denied_Existence> Just in case....
<Ghosties> I just can't believe you don't see the problem with it
<ClockworkPie> O.o
*ClockworkPie starts to panic
<Ziltoid> oj no
*LL-XBL 12would want it too tho X3
*Denied_Existence sees a wild ClockworkPie appear!
<Ghosties> I feel like you don't even see where I'm coming from
*ClockworkPie uses tackle
<Hipster_Brony> i honestly and truly dont, and heres why:
*Denied_Existence is hit by tackle. Its not very effective...
*Denied_Existence uses revolver!
<Sathi> I discussed the rule with a friend a moment ago and he said this. i better stfu about things that kill fun for others.
<Aurora> 6too pink
<Aurora> 6otherwise yes
<Hipster_Brony> we are trying to keep people from bringing up divisive topics, to keep chat from turning into a shitstorm
<Ghosties> You're trying to herd them into being cattle
*ClockworkPie is shot by revolver, its super effective
<ReticentSmolder_> so um, yeah, #Silent_Hill is up for people who like free movies
*Denied_Existence throws a ponyball!
<Hipster_Brony> politics and religion are perfect examples of topics NOT to bring up
*ClockworkPie faints ;_;
*Denied_Existence catches ClockworkPie in the ponyball!
*ClockworkPie is now in a ponyball
<Polarfire> XD
<Ghosties> Do you even think like a regular user, Hipster?
<Hipster_Brony> dammit ghosties, you arent even listening to me
*Denied_Existence asks himself, "Now what do I do with this...?"
<Hipster_Brony> all it takes is a handful of people to ruin the entire event
<Ghosties> I fucking hear you, but you can't see what I'm trying to tell you
<Kosoveon> hi sheena
<SheenaFox> hi Kosoveo
*Denied_Existence faints!
<SheenaFox> n
<SheenaFox> fu
<Hipster_Brony> and then guess what, people stop coming
<Kosoveon> o-o
<Ghosties> I fucking get that it can cause a shit storm
<Ghosties> I fucking get it
<Kosoveon> well excuse me
<ClockworkPie> nooo master
*Kosoveon shot
<Aurora> 6lol
*Denied_Existence has no more ponymon! He loses the battle!
<Ghosties> I understand that it can cause drama to stir up, I know. Religion and politics do that
<Hipster_Brony> because they dont want to come here and listen to a fucking shitstorm about obama this or christianity that
<Hipster_Brony> then why is this such an issue?
<Denied_Existence> Hmm...I want to test something
<Hipster_Brony> its bad for the event, therefore, we're not doing it
<Pattyrick|shower> Back
<Ghosties> But you don't seem to see that telling people to not talk about religion or politics is basically saying that you can't talk about anything that's not safe
<Ghosties> You are labeling these people
<SheenaFox> You come back into chat while you're in the shower?
<SheenaFox> O:
<Ghosties> Because god fucking forbid anyone ever talks about anything that isn't safe
<Ghosties> Next we won't be able to talk about sex
<Pattyrick|shower> Lol, I just told it to change my name but it didn't
<Hipster_Brony> you know what, we cant all be idealists
<SheenaFox> |D
<Ghosties> I'm the idealist?
<Denied_Existence> Damn, I can't do /(Someone else's name)
<ClockworkPie> ?
<Kosoveon> patty's hardcore
<Hipster_Brony> im trying to run a successful event here, not trying to uphold some grand vision of freedom of speech
<Ghosties> Dude, you're on fucking Ponychan all the goddamn time on meta giving out sage advice to people
<ClockworkPie> D:
<Kosoveon> :P
<Pattyrick|shower> Gah, stupid client
*Denied_Existence shrugs.
<SirSprinkles> 6Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand now we're just arguing. Which means you both need to chill for a second. So please do while I respectfully voice my opinion.
<Pattyrick|shower> Won't let me ghost my name
<Sathi> 7nope :)
*Denied_Existence 's computer engineering knowledge has no effect!
<ClockworkPie> lol
<HyperMetalLugia> what client
<Pattyrick|shower> Pattyrick|shower used an unknown command
<SirSprinkles> 6Ghosties, it takes only one person to ruin everything for everypony. And since you're so keen on thinking about the viewers, think about a new viewer coming to the stream for the first time and running into a shitstorm? Would you want to come back?
<Pattyrick|shower> IRC999
<Pattyrick|shower> There
<HyperMetalLugia> Duh
<HyperMetalLugia> Of course it's stupid
<Pattyrick|shower> Hi Zoroark
<HyperMetalLugia> Use a real client like mibbit
<Denied_Existence> Yeah, my father was (and still is) a computer engineer. He was the head of the various departments over several companies
<SirSprinkles> 6Hipster, you don't need to have examples in the rules. Everypony will know to behave themselves, and if they don't that's where we do our job as mods and ask them to stop.
<Ghosties> ...you have a point, Sprinkles.
<Pattyrick> They have iPod app?
<Steven_Magnet> 12,7Hail Steve, the fabled Englushmen *Awesomesauce*
<Steven_Magnet> 12,7Hail Steve, the fabled Englushmen *Awesomesauce*
<ClockworkPie> cool
<HyperMetalLugia> < App
<Hipster_Brony> sprinkles, the reason i want examples is so we have clarity
<HyperMetalLugia> < Failure
<HyperMetalLugia> Nope
<HyperMetalLugia> Use the terrible browser that is included
<HyperMetalLugia> Or use a computer :P
<prince-dari> Fuck.
<SirSprinkles> 6The clarity will come forward very quickly as soon as anypony sees a single warning.
<prince-dari> Stupid channel modes disappearing.
<Nittany_Tiger> Forget BC2. I'm too out of it to do well.
<Pattyrick> Bad internet connection
<Denied_Existence> ?
<Hipster_Brony> otherwise we're going to get a million questions about "is X considered a controversial topic?"
<prince-dari> Whoops
<Pattyrick> For my PC
<prince-dari> Wrong channel.
<SirSprinkles> 6We'll still get them anyway.
<HyperMetalLugia> Move the PC? :P
<FlutterHi> As amusing as that is
<Hipster_Brony> +e?
<RainBroDash> wat
<SirSprinkles> 6It's part of our job as a mod to deal with those questions.
<FlutterHi> As amusing as that is
<Ghosties> Exactly, we are the complaint guys after all
<SirSprinkles> 6+e is exempt from the ban on everything.
<FlutterHi> I had my volume allll the way up
<Nittany_Tiger> Got any grapes?
<Hipster_Brony> ah
<FlutterHi> GOT ANY NAILS?
<Pattyrick> Why should I need to do that? It worked before but for the past few days it's been acting up
<Hipster_Brony> but sprinkles, what im saying is we can avoid some of those questions by giving examples in thefirst place
<Denied_Existence> FIRST, YOU MUST BRING ME....A SHRUBBERY
<Hipster_Brony> the first*
<Zoroark> Hiya.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm sad that I can't hang around here during the week. Also, my phone doesn't like connecting to this server.
<Ghosties> But we're the complaint guys, if the viewers have questions then they can just come to us
<HyperMetalLugia> So we don't need to listen to you complain about IRC66-999?
<FlutterHi> were you telling the duck joke?
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Sathi> exactly
<Pattyrick> Tells me to replace my ethernet cable on my router (which has been working for a long time)
<FlutterHi> ohhhh shit
<SirSprinkles> 6However, Hipster, we'll still get questions about what qualifies as political, religious, etc.
<FlutterHi> nice
<Pattyrick> Lol, I didn't complain
<Sathi> and you guys can explain then
<Ghosties> That's right
<Zoroark> >real client
<Zoroark> >mibbit
*Denied_Existence scratches his head, slightly confused yet again.
<HyperMetalLugia> 22:53] <Pattyrick|shower> Gah, stupid client
<HyperMetalLugia> [22:53] <Pattyrick|shower> Won't let me ghost my name < Complaint
<HyperMetalLugia> Well yes Zoroark
<Pattyrick> I just said that it wouldn't let me use the GHOST command
<Zoroark> haha, what
<HyperMetalLugia> Seems like a complaint
<Hipster_Brony> well, i still think we should have examples, but im clearly in the minority, so we'll go with no examples
<HyperMetalLugia> Mibbit is a real client compared to IRC999
<Pattyrick> No, statement, not complaint :P
<Denied_Existence> I guess computer knowledge comes in like a wave.
<eXAKR> Pattyrick which IRC client are you using?
<Pattyrick> IRC999
<Ghosties> It's the reason why we decided to implement mods as complaint people. If they have questions, then they come to us and we handle it
<Denied_Existence> You can never start learning everything at once.
<eXAKR> oO
<eXAKR> Never heard of this one
<eXAKR> Use Mibbit
<Zoroark> yeah i haven't either
<eXAKR> or better, download mIRC if you can
*SilverSonic is gonna play some OoT tonight
<HyperMetalLugia> Same
<Pattyrick> On my iPod?
<HyperMetalLugia> Only iTards use it
<Zoroark> get colloquy
<SilverSonic> meh, for the millionth time i'll try to beat fire temple
<SilverSonic> .-.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hmm
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02that was pretty cool
<Zoroark> if you're on your ipod :V
<Zoroark> i never had too many problems with colloquy
<Persian> SO WHY EXACTLY WOULD A CAT SHAPED LIKE A POPTART EVEN WANT TO BE HURLING THROUGH SPACE totally unrealistic says this twittering feline
<SirSprinkles> 6I have no problem with using examples, however they should be examples that are easily defined. Political and religious discussion is hard to define as what would be allowed and what would not. Whereas Cupcakes is easy to define, and is simply not allowed.
<eXAKR> Colloquy is worth the money I say
<Zoroark> the only problem was that it crashed after a while due to not deleting logs after a while
<eXAKR> HyperMetalLugia shut up
*eXAKR hides
<Pattyrick> I have mIRC on my PC, but its internet sucks and I'm using my iPod instead
<Zoroark> but it's my fault for idling in channels with lots of activity
<eXAKR> Pattyrick try downloading Colloquy for the iOS
<Pattyrick> I can probably get it for free
<Hipster_Brony> okay, but we cant do ONLY cupcakes though
<Pattyrick> Ok
<Pattyrick> Brb
<SirSprinkles> 6I understand this.
<Hipster_Brony> because people will think it means ONLY cupcakes
<Sathi> 7I'm blonde... I have my bf for computer knowledge if I need it :P
<HyperMetalLugia> No thanks eXAKR
<Ghosties> How about Syrup
<Hipster_Brony> syrup isnt a divisive topic though
<Ghosties> Syrup is disgusting
<SirSprinkles> 6Syrup is not as highly controversial.
<ReticentSmolder_> throw me some comp knowledge, cuz I'm so retarded
<Ghosties> No one wants to talk about pony menstruation blood
<SirSprinkles> 6And we have allowed discussion on that front in the past.
<Hipster_Brony> ive never seen a shitstorm start over syrup
<Pattyrick> I'd have to agree with eXAKR ;)
<Ghosties> ...do they?
<eXAKR> It's worth the USD$1.99
<Sathi> ewww..
<Sathi> what the...
<Sathi> first time I heard of that...
<Sathi> :S
<Hipster_Brony> sathi: ponychan meme
<Ghosties> See
<Kosoveon> hi J
<Ghosties> Sathi thinks it's disgusting
<SirSprinkles> 6It's one of those things that we allowed based on what was being talked about.
<HyperMetalLugia> (There wouldn't even be a need for half of the 'apps' if some lazy company added a proper browser and OS to their tablet)
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not as set in stone controversial as Cupcakes.
*eXAKR smacks HyperMetalLugia with an iPad
<SirSprinkles> 6Which means we need something that is.
<Hipster_Brony> its gross, but its not something that is going to turn the chat into a shitstorm
<J-Lugia> hi Kos
<SirSprinkles> 6Exactly.
<Ghosties> What else is considered controversial in the fandom?
<Hipster_Brony> which is what im concerned with
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, at least the Wii supports Mibbit and Youtube out of the box :P
<FlutterHi> can we talk about networking?
<Hipster_Brony> thats what im saying though
<HyperMetalLugia> And we all know how underpowered the Wii is
<FlutterHi> I just moved an entire office to a new location
<Ghosties> Look, as far as I'm concerned, we can just answer those questions. We leave cupcakes as the example
<Hipster_Brony> cupcakes is pretty much the only thing in the fandom thats highly divisive
*eXAKR stuffs HyperMetalLugia's bed in these bedsheets: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hNQwbALMqTo/TjRsXnlLQDI/AAAAAAAAJfE/EUrK0PRYtuE/s1600/Clipboard01.jpg
<SirSprinkles> 6I honestly say we should attempt to limit the "soandso is best pony" talk, but that's just me.
*eXAKR RUNS
<Ghosties> So we get more questions about what's controversial, it's our job as mods
<FlutterHi> and I have Local Area Networks on the brain man
<Zoroark> i've used mibbit on my iPod
<Zoroark> When I had one that is
<Hipster_Brony> naw sprinkles, those topics can be fun
*HyperMetalLugia uses the bedsheets as a combustable and sets eXAKR's house on fire
<SirSprinkles> 6...I have yet to have a fun one.
<eXAKR> I used Mibbit on my iPhone as well
<SirSprinkles> 6Ever.
<Hipster_Brony> and they usually dont end in anyone getting upset
<eXAKR> A bit wonky
<SirSprinkles> 6Wrong again.
<eXAKR> So I downloaded Colloquy
<Ghosties> You'd be surprised...
<HyperMetalLugia> Terrible :P
*eXAKR pours buckets of water on HyperMetalLugia
<Zoroark> colloquy's the best IRC client yeah
<Zoroark> on iOS that is
<Hipster_Brony> >mfw ive never gotten upset during a best pony conversation
<FlutterHi> that and port fotwarding.... so. much. port. forwarding.
<Pattyrick> I just got it, let me switch to it
<prince-dari> Those conversations are funny.
<J-Lugia> I'm gonna say that the title goes to Linkinus
<Ghosties> dari, you banned soipony
<prince-dari> People don't tend to argue.
<prince-dari> ...
<Ghosties> for disliking rd
<prince-dari> Wut?
<J-Lugia> exept for the fact you gotta pay for the sucker
<Glacymr> 12oww ;-;
<prince-dari> Oh.
<SirSprinkles> 6That's because your favorite pony is Rainbow, and most ponies agree with you.
<prince-dari> That's just trolling though.
<prince-dari> I unbanned him straight away.
<Denied_Existence> I could call up my father...but I think he is in china right now...
<Hipster_Brony> that was a silly thing though
<Ghosties> And even IF it was just trolling, some viewers may not have saw it that way
<prince-dari> Lawl, I trollban people all the time.
<Denied_Existence> Let me check
<prince-dari> No one cares.
<SirSprinkles> 6When your favorite pony is one of the ones that isn't as popular, it gets very offensive very quickly.
<Polarfire> just ask dari.
<Kosoveon> what's wrong glacy? :(
<Sathi> 7Aye ask Dari
<Polarfire> he's a genius.
<Hipster_Brony> i kick people for talking shit about RD all the time, i never do it from a place of anger though
<prince-dari> No one argues anyway?
<Daxton> nope.avi
<prince-dari> The conversations just go like this:
<Hipster_Brony> X is best pony
<Glacymr> 12i took a shower
<Ghosties> I say leave Cupcakes as the example. We can just answer any questions otherwise
<SirSprinkles> 6Again, just my personal opinion.
<Glacymr> 12and got shampoo in my eye
<eXAKR> !glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to eXAKR for 7 minutes and has to fly eXAKR around until then
<Hipster_Brony> thats not how you spell X pony
<prince-dari> ^
<eXAKR> Yikes
<Kosoveon> that happens to me every time
<prince-dari> I'd definitely say include religion and politics in the rules.
<SirSprinkles> 6I say we not have an example for the moment, and should a second one comes up we simply add it and Cupcakes to the rules.
<Hipster_Brony> but ghosties, do you see why we cant just leave it at cupcakes?
<Kosoveon> thats why I always have a washcloth nearby
<Ghosties> That sounds fair, Sprinkles
<prince-dari> Ask me what?
<LL-XBL> 12then close your eyes? XD
<Glacymr> 12i don't know how it happened
<Sathi> 7it's alive!
<Denied_Existence> Yeah, he's still in china
<Ghosties> Do you see why it's oppressive to include religion and politics?
<Glacymr> 12i was shampooing my head
<Sathi> 7*giggles*
<Kosoveon> doesn't help much
<Kosoveon> shampoo is really tricky
<prince-dari> Haha, Sathi. XD
<Hipster_Brony> no, i dont, since theyre more or less going to be against the rules anyway
<Glacymr> 12my eyes were closed the entire time then i started wiping my face off with a wash cloth to get the soap off my eyes like i always do, my eyes were still closed and it somehow happened
<prince-dari> ...
<ReticentSmolder_> Dari, I need your help
<prince-dari> FUCKING TAB BUTTON
<SirSprinkles> 6Hipster, not necessarily.
<prince-dari> ASDIOPGAOPWDJFGPAOJKWEPKOAQWERGKOP
<ReticentSmolder_> pwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwease?
<Polarfire> fukken capped
<Hipster_Brony> heres an example:
<Ghosties> Really, truthfully, it's not so much that I think people should start shit storms over it. It's that us mods purposefully saying to a regular joe "You, you can't talk about religion or politics because it's not safe" is pretty insulting to the regular viewer.
*Denied_Existence shrugs
<ReticentSmolder_> prince-dari I need your help, I'm trying to do a livestream and I can't capture the audio
<Hipster_Brony> eh, not going to give an example unless you want me to
<Sathi> also.. we have tools for shitstorms +m channel for instance
<prince-dari> Are you using FME?
<SirSprinkles> 6Example of something that would be against the rules if religion and politics is left in the rules but would still be okay imo: The talking about greek mythology symbolism in Rainbow.
<ReticentSmolder_> ...no?
<Hipster_Brony> sathi: once they begin, they dont stop easily
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<eXAKR> I rarely get shampoo in my eyes
<Ghosties> But we've stopped it, Hip
<ReticentSmolder_> ho do I shot web?
<Ghosties> We always have
<RainBroDash> 10lolol
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe because you rarely shampoo?
<Hipster_Brony> we stopped it before it turned into a shitstorm though
<prince-dari> What media encoder software are you using?
<SirSprinkles> 6Hipster, that's what +m and kicks/bans are for.
<Kosoveon> well no matter how many times I try I always get at least a little shampoo in my eyes
<Hipster_Brony> once its in progress, its much harder
<eXAKR> I just tilt my head forwards or back when washing the shampoo off, until they are rinsed off
<SirSprinkles> 6And again, we have to do our jobs as mods.
<Kosoveon> even if I close them or I was the shampoo off quickly
<Ghosties> And again, it sounds like you don't trust our abilities to kick and mod appropriately
*eXAKR shoves HyperMetalLugia into a wall
<Kosoveon> *was
<Kosoveon> *WASH
<SirSprinkles> 6If it comes to that it comes to that.
<Ghosties> That's how it sounds
<eXAKR> I shampoo everyday, good sir.
<ReticentSmolder_> ummm, SoundMax? I'm just choosing the software my speakers use but I guess I'm not using any software
<FlutterHi> lol live stream is such a ram gobler
<Aeroslash> calm yourself Kos
<Hipster_Brony> no ghosties
<Aeroslash> and wb Pat
<Ghosties> That's how it comes off
<Kosoveon> yeah you're really one to tell me to calm myself :P
<Pattyrick> Yay, it works
<ReticentSmolder_> @FlutterHi yeah it is, but its free
<prince-dari> People get pissed off when those topics come up.
<Hipster_Brony> im confident in all of our abilities to mod
<Hipster_Brony> but
<prince-dari> I agree with Hipster completely.
<Pattyrick> Thanks Aero
<eXAKR> Good
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Ghosties> Then you should be able to trust uis
<Ghosties> *us
<prince-dari> ...What stream site are you using?
<Hipster_Brony> once 200 people start talking about it, a mute and a warning isnt going to stop it
<Pattyrick> I got it free because mine is jailbroken and I have Installeous :P
<ReticentSmolder_> I'm using Livestream, and their client Procaster
<Hipster_Brony> and a banning spree is just going to get people angry
<Kosoveon> also aero
<HyperMetalLugia> Why'd you jailbreak it
<Aeroslash> Kos?
<SirSprinkles> 6And yet we have a rule about that kind of thing anyway.
<Kosoveon> if you are a potato why don't you die already :|
<Ghosties> Hipster, have we EVER had 200 people causing a shit storm? No, we always containt
<Ghosties> *contain it
<eXAKR> lol pirating apps on iOS
<Aeroslash> D:
<Aeroslash> nuuuuuu
<ReticentSmolder_> video works fine, but audio is apparently fucked up
<SirSprinkles> 6It's our job to contain it BEFORE it happens.
<Ghosties> Exactly
<Ghosties> We're mods
<Hipster_Brony> ghosties, thats what the rule is for, as i have said multiple times
<Hipster_Brony> to stop it BEFORE it happens
<Ghosties> But we always have stopped it before it happens
<SirSprinkles> 6Hipster, that's why we just don't put in ANY examples.
<Pattyrick> Because jailbreaking it allows me to do awesome stuff, and you know it xD
<SirSprinkles> 6We have a failsafe in our disclaimer.
<prince-dari> Hmm, I've never used that site.
<prince-dari> Or procaster.
<HyperMetalLugia> Why couldn't you do that awesome stuff in the first place? :o
<Sathi> 7I use it frequently ..but without music.. just drawing stuff
<Pattyrick> And, if I need to get rid of it, I just update
<Sathi> 7or sounds*
<Denied_Existence> Livestream is sorta nice. It gets the job done?
<eXAKR> http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/palemale-store_2170_1135405
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh, so Apple doesn't want you to jailbreak your device it seems, how terrible :<
<Sathi> 7yes
<ReticentSmolder_> yeah, the video works fine, but I just can't get my sound captured
<Sathi> 7I can even zoom into the tools I use
<Pattyrick> Because Apple made sure that pirates couldn't destroy them
<ReticentSmolder_> I heard that you could hear my music faintly but it had static
<HyperMetalLugia> Yet their store prices are ridiculously cheap, or so I've heard
<DariHasnoBalls> hey
<Pattyrick> But I'm not a complete pirate; I only get some apps for free and do basic changes
<Pattyrick> They are
<Pattyrick> But just for the sake of having stuff for free :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Yet you can afford your 300+ iDevice
<HyperMetalLugia> Ironic
<ReticentSmolder_> he's not going to know he's unbanned though
<Hipster_Brony> the problem there is people could just decide not to bring up any topic that they think might cause ANY disagreement
<Pattyrick> Mmmhmmm
<Denied_Existence> ?
<prince-dari> >Not bothered :P
<Pattyrick> :D
<HyperMetalLugia> Not really, just plain stupid
<HyperMetalLugia> Like you
<HyperMetalLugia> :)
<Denied_Existence> Somebody we know eh?
<Hipster_Brony> because "controversial" isnt defined in that case
<Pattyrick> Like a boss
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Sathi> 7Where is Dman btw?
<SoiPony> @pony the pony Dari would have gay buttsex with
<Steven_Magnet> 6 the pony Dari would have gay buttsex with is 15Prince Blueb8lood
<prince-dari> :o I dunno.
<Ghosties> So you'd rather censor anything that's not safe first?
<SirSprinkles> 6Then they ask.
<SoiPony> HAHAHAHAHAH
<SirSprinkles> 6And we answer.
<RainBroDash> 10HAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAA
<RainBroDash> 10LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
<HyperMetalLugia> The only thing I've ever hacked was my Wii
<Pattyrick> You know it's awesome, drf just brainwashed you to hate it ;)
<Polarfire> h..
<Polarfire> hmmm
<Daxton> trolololololol
<Denied_Existence> ....?
<ReticentSmolder_> HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG
<SirSprinkles> 6If it's what has to happen for now, it's what has to happen for now.
<Ziltoid> wait what
<Polarfire> to cap or not to cap
<SirSprinkles> 6We can always change the rules again later.
<Pattyrick> Nobody brainwashed me
<HyperMetalLugia> You know you're being silly, as I've hated Apple even before I knew what IRC is
<SoiPony> >mfw that worked
<Ghosties> Listen, I'll make you a deal Hip
<Denied_Existence> To ask or not to ask?
<prince-dari> Oh you.
<HyperMetalLugia> So somebody here is the liar
<Polarfire> XD
<ReticentSmolder_> afk for a bit, CONFOUND THESE LIVESTREAMS
<SoiPony> <3
<SoiPony> :D
<Denied_Existence> Bye again
<Ghosties> The first time we let a shit storm blow up and I mean blow up ALL over chat, then you can put "no discussing controversial topics like religion or politics" Deal?

<Ziltoid> rainbro is huge pedo
<SheenaFox> and I was also talking about the minecraft creeper
<Hipster_Brony> that got lost in the shuffle over that last rule
<Ghosties> Like the number of kicks and warnings?
<Pattyrick|goodnight> Bye

*Fishy 12smiles
<Denied_Existence> Wait...if you already knew what 34 was...WHO ARE YOU!?
<Ghosties> ...I forgot -___________-
<SilverSonic> How are you today :3
<Hipster_Brony> alrighty then
<rainbordash> 10is best mod
<problem> 12script kitteis are n00bs
<Ghosties> All I can remember is that if someone is outright trolling to kick them and then if they continue, ban them
<Denied_Existence> Some 4channer no doubt
<Denied_Existence> AHA!
<SoiPony> hahahaha
<Denied_Existence> I knew it!
<Hipster_Brony> well, obvious trolls im just going to ban straight away
<SoiPony> >mfw he's in the dark
<Daxton> my boi
<Ghosties> That makes sense
<Daxton> you showed rule 34 to a 10 year old?
<Hipster_Brony> they can appeal if we banned them incorrectly
<Daxton> your sick
<SoiPony> xD
<Ghosties> Do we have that in the rules? That they can appeal?
<Fishy> 12Good.
<Fishy> 12Watchin' Glee.
<Hipster_Brony> yeah
<Sathi> Question
<Fishy> 12And Doctor who
<Denied_Existence> I am seriously doubting problem is 10
<HyperMetalLugia> What episode
<Ghosties> Alright
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol multitasking
<Hipster_Brony> IMPORTANT: If you receive a ban, it is ALWAYS permanent unless you appeal. To appeal, use the command “/join #BronyStateAppeals”. Here, you will meet with the mod staff and explain why you should be allowed to return to Brony State. After we have heard your appeal, we will decide the length of your ban. DO NOT join the #BronyStateAppeals channel unless yo
<Sathi> is the questions and concerns job added to the new team yet?
<Fishy> 12Hm...
<Denied_Existence> So far he's shown us he knows of the tri-force
<Fishy> 12Original Song
<prince-dari> RainBro is talking on Skype, he's avoiding talking to us.
<Daxton> yeah, i bet he is some faggot loser from 4chan
<Hipster_Brony> dammit mibbit
<SoiPony> BWAHAHAHA XD
<Denied_Existence> GIVE ME HIS SKYPE
<Ghosties> Uh, I think Sprinkles was gonna add it to our duties?
<Fishy> 12I've had "Loser Like Me" in my head for five. Days.
<Hipster_Brony> cut off the last part
<Ghosties> And yeah, that looks fine, Hip
<Denied_Existence> I WILL CONFRONT HIM
<Ghosties> WHOA, NEW TEXT FONT
<Hipster_Brony> but yeah, you get where the last part is going
<SilverSonic> oh god glee
*SilverSonic mauled
<drf|laptop> 03EW GLEE
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't want to add anything more to the duties than necessary...
<Denied_Existence> But yeah...I think problem is more along the lines of 15-17
<HyperMetalLugia> Glee is meh
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<drf|laptop> 03they basically destroy good songs
<SirSprinkles> 6And yeah, Ghosties, the font randomly changed for no reason.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<Ghosties> Well, we should make it clear to the users that if they have questions or concern to know which mods to go to
<Fishy> 12@drf they made Friday amazing.
<HyperMetalLugia> Like Safety Dance ;.;
*HyperMetalLugia runs
<Daxton> he could be like 30
<SirSprinkles> 6It's in the rules.
<SilverSonic> lol Starlit
<Ghosties> Ah, alright
<SilverSonic> NOTHING can make Friday amazing
<SirSprinkles> 6At the very end of it.
<SilverSonic> NOTHING
<Denied_Existence> I suppose, but the older you get, the less trolling appeals to you
<Fishy> 12>:D
<prince-dari> mib_4kkpeb and mib_pmkj3m are the same person, lol.
<problem> 12/f/ca
<Ghosties> Not the current rules, is it?
<SilverSonic> Glee's attempt was rubbish
<Fishy> 12How about "my moment"?
<SirSprinkles> 6No, the ones that are being written.
<Denied_Existence> DONT GIVE ME THAT
<Hipster_Brony> also, we need to update the history section on the about us page
<SoiPony> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6I know Hipster.
<SilverSonic> that song was, meh ok
<Ziltoid> everything is a lie
<Polarfire> what the fuck
<notproblem> im back bitches
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll have it done prior to next week.
<Denied_Existence> problem, YOU LIE
<Hipster_Brony> not only does it not mention RBD or Sathi getting hired, but it doesnt mention peanut either XD
<notproblem> lie about what
<SirSprinkles> 6Just need to know what we'd like put in there, really.
<FlutterHi> problem, lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Eyup.
*Denied_Existence slams his head against his desk repeatedly.
<Daxton> hey faggot
<SirSprinkles> 6That's because Peanut wasn't on the list when Silver made the site.
<Denied_Existence> AAAGGHHH
<Ghosties> BTW, the bit about users going to me, Hipster, or Sprinkles will be in the revision yep?
<notproblem> STFU
<SilverSonic> D:
<Ziltoid> problem?
<Denied_Existence> Keine lust!
<notproblem> so i heard ponies is gay
<Denied_Existence> So...I heard you were homosexual
<notproblem> ohrly?
<Sathi> Well guys this is it for me.. I'm going to bed.. Hope you enjoyed my suggestions / feedback.. I'll see you all soon again
<Polarfire> dari, newspaper?
<Denied_Existence> Its good you came out of the closet!
<Fishy-Sleeping> 12Hang on, I'll be back.

<Fishy-Sleeping> 12Give me half an hour.

<RarityIsBest> when are they showing inception?
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<notproblem> that movie sucks
<RarityIsBest> just curious bro
<Nittany_Tiger> I could always do this, which is completely random.
*Nittany_Tiger explodes.
<Denied_Existence> Silly notproblem! That is not how trolling works!
<prince-dari> RarityIsBest: It's on Friday at 7pm EST
<notproblem> hmm can you teach me?
<Hipster_Brony> you know how you can get email addresses with a "company name" or whatever at the end?
<RarityIsBest> not today? :/
<Denied_Existence> ~yay~
<Hipster_Brony> is there a way we can do that for free?
<RarityIsBest> what're they showing later
<Hipster_Brony> so we can have site emails for brony state business?
<RainBorDash> Yeah.
<Hipster_Brony> you know what i mean?
<RainBorDash> I think.
<Denied_Existence> So...
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm sure there is.
<Denied_Existence> Trolls gone, now what?
<RainBorDash> So sort of blahblahblah@bronystate.co.cc?
<SoiPony> @pony best troll pony
<Steven_Magnet> 6 best troll pony is 5Snai10ls
<Hipster_Brony> like mine would be HipsterBrony@bronystate.com or w/e
<Denied_Existence> BAM
<Denied_Existence> So true
<Hipster_Brony> or yeah, something like that
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol.
<RainBorDash> There's something like 5 free emails with the free domain.
<Hipster_Brony> hmmmm
<Hipster_Brony> well
<SirSprinkles> 6Not exactly enough of them.
<Hipster_Brony> we can do me sprinkles and ghosties for complaints, and one that we can all access maybe
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll look in to it, see what I can find by next week.
<Hipster_Brony> like how we have the bronystate gmail account now
<NotAproblem> so gilda is best pony
<eXAKR> !glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to eXAKR for 18 minutes and has to fly eXAKR around until then
<Ghosties> Sounds good
<RainBorDash> We could get 2 domains just for emails or something.
<Nittany_Tiger> You might be onto something.
<Denied_Existence> Oh, look, I spoke too soon
<RainBorDash> So blahblahblah@brony.co.cc
<RainBorDash> And then blahblahblah@bronies.co.cc, but that's kind of confusing
<Denied_Existence> If she was a pony, perhaps
<NotAproblem> spoke too soon about what
<SirSprinkles> 6About Us is updated.
<NotAproblem> you know what sight sucks major dick is ponychan
<SirSprinkles> 6And like I said, I'll see what I can find out about it.
<Hipster_Brony> yeah, i wouldnt want to do it that way
<NotAproblem> in my opinion
<SirSprinkles> 6We'll discuss it further next week.
<Denied_Existence> Enlighten me
<Ghosties> That's what I want
<Ghosties> blahblahblah@brony.co.cc
<NotAproblem> too many tripfags
<Ghosties> ...I'm kidding >_<
<Denied_Existence> Define this term you use.
<Hipster_Brony> it would be nice to have set up before we move over to the new site though
<NotAproblem> tripcode fags
<Denied_Existence> Meh
<Hipster_Brony> brb
<NotAproblem> no!
<Denied_Existence> MUAHAHAHA
<SirSprinkles> 6Again, I'm going to look into it to see what can be done about it.
<Nittany_Tiger> tripcode?
<ShostiesIsGay> 4umad?
<Ghosties> Alright, well, are the rules done? Can we see what it looks like, Hip?
*Glacymr bites Cube
<NightSeas> 12bbl
<Glacymr> 12kk
<Denied_Existence> And the bass keeps runnin' runnin'
*Nittany_Tiger explodes
<SirSprinkles> 6...I'm getting seriously sick of this guy.
<Dashite> Okay...
<Dashite> How long ago did I get kicked? O.o
<Polarfire> me too sprinkles.
<Dashite> Who are we sick of?
<SirSprinkles> 6Aww... is he too afraid to talk?
<Denied_Existence> @Dashite I think it was a mistake in typing
<ModsAreProblem> umad bro?
<Ghosties> You know what I love
<Ghosties> 4Colors
<Denied_Existence> But we are currently mad at some~I spoke too soon
<Hipster_Brony> 1 sec
<Ghosties> Okay
<Ghosties> 4*claps*
<Hipster_Brony> http://mibpaste.com/OibLsS
<Polarfire> thanks sprinkles.
*Denied_Existence claps.
<Polarfire> We appreciate it.
<Denied_Existence> Although I was kinda having fun counter-trolling him
<Ghosties> Question
<Ghosties> Do we ever kick anymore?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<FlutterHi> if your counter trolling he's already done his job as a troll
<Ghosties> It seems like with the recent "one warning, then ban" bit that kicking is just obsolete
<Hipster_Brony> i kick all the time
*Denied_Existence says over the radio "*Kzzzt* Counter-trollerists win. *Kzzzt*"
<Ghosties> Well, I mean, obviously to troll the viewers
<Hipster_Brony> not just for trolling either
<Denied_Existence> Meh, I dont do it to rid myself of him
<FlutterHi> lol now I wanna play CSS
<Ghosties> So, is kick ever used as an actual tool of modding?
<Denied_Existence> MY EVIL KNOWS NO BOUNDS
<SirSprinkles> 6I just let that troll get kicked three times before I banned him, dude.
<Hipster_Brony> yes
<RainBorDash> Cascade Style Sheet?
<RainBorDash> :P
<Hipster_Brony> i use it as a final warning before a ban
<Ghosties> Problem is, I have no idea who kicked him
<RainBroDash> 10"Ghosties: DO HO HO"
<Hipster_Brony> dari did i think
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari did three times, and then RainBro
<Ghosties> Speaking of, dari should really change the script so that mods can nick change and still keep mod powers
<SirSprinkles> 6They can.
<RainBorDash> Yeah, I can do that.
<Ghosties> 4Dat's mah catchprase
<ReticentSmolder_> gah, I give up, I'm just gonna watch Silent Hill solo, stupid livestream audio...
<SirSprinkles> 6Hence RainBorDash
<RainBorDash> He means so the colours script doesn't kick
<Polarfire> D:
<Ghosties> Yeah, that's what I mean
<ReticentSmolder_> well, I would share but it'd be a silent movie
<SirSprinkles> 6We can just use !addmod
<Polarfire> its ok.
<RainBorDash> I'll just change the script.
<Nittany_Tiger> I keep forgetting what CSS means as far as computers so.
<SirSprinkles> 6And the function to remove it that I can never remember.
*Denied_Existence salutes ReticentSmolder for his braveness.
<RainBorDash> To go by whether someone has op/halfop
<RainBorDash> To base whether it kicks them or not.
<Ghosties> But I may change my name a lot. I don't expect it to happen, but if Dari's way is much easier then I'd like to implement that
<RainBroDash> 10DUDE
<RainBroDash> 10RIDE HORSES
<RainBroDash> 10THEY'RE FASTER
<Denied_Existence> !?
<RainBroDash> 10AND BRAVEER
<Aeroslash> night all
<ReticentSmolder> unless anyone knows how to set up Livestream audio
<Denied_Existence> WHAT ARE YOU RUNNING YOUR MOUTH ABOUT!?
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, I'm kinda glad I got to feed Anna today.
<Denied_Existence> AAAAGGGHH
<RainBorDash> Sprinkles: Is Anna the name of someone you keep in your cellar?
<Denied_Existence> @SirSprinkles Who is Anna if you don't mind me asking?
<SirSprinkles> 6Anna is the name of my banhammer.
<SoiPony> lol
<RainBorDash> Ahh.
<Denied_Existence> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6I named her back during the mini raid, remember?
<Polarfire> XD
<Denied_Existence> I missed this raid.
<Polarfire> mini raid?
<Polarfire> enlighten me.
<Denied_Existence> ^
<SirSprinkles> 6It was like, two guys with dynamic IPs.
*Polarfire grabs popcorn
<SirSprinkles> 6I put area bans on them. XD
*Denied_Existence steals some of Polarfire's popcorn.
<Polarfire> hmm.
<Polarfire> off to google dynamic ip's.
<Denied_Existence> Where they trolling?
*Polarfire gives the rest of the popcorn to DE.
<Denied_Existence> Dynamic IP's are basically changing IP addresses
<Denied_Existence> They change constantly
<Denied_Existence> Making them hard to ban
<Polarfire> oh.
*Polarfire takes popcorn back.
<SirSprinkles> 6Hard to ban anywhere that can't use area bans.
<SirSprinkles> 6But IRC clients can area ban.
<Polarfire> lol.
<SirSprinkles> 6Which makes them easy to get rid of.
<RainBorDash> IRC clients have excepts too.
<RainBorDash> So you can allow people banned by area bans to get in anyway.
<RainBorDash> On an individual basis.
<RainBroDash> 10+e :3
<Denied_Existence> ?
<Denied_Existence> Don't you already have op?
<Polarfire> and weren't you already here?

<Sneas> 03LOL
*Denied_Existence runs to avoid the traser rounds.
<Polarfire> Balloon Operator: Get in quick!

*Denied_Existence waits and watches his monitors
*Denied_Existence begins changing the settings on the reactor
*Polarfire By the time all the parasprites have left the cave, they form huge clouds in the sky and block out the sun

*Polarfire Parasprites begin to choke in the gas, but it appears they have found the fresh air vent.
<Chimera> 04and Ascendant :3
*Polarfire The parasprites begin to enter through the vent, ignoring the gas chambers
*Denied_Existence sees that the sprites have reached the air vent and detonates the thermite grenades, destroying the control panels in the room.

*Denied_Existence looks on the monitors, enjoying the dramatic irony.
<Lugianite> did not know Superman and Batman were Pokemon Trainers
*Lugianite runs
*Polarfire The parasprites continue to move earth, trees, rocks, rubble, and whatever else they can find onto the openings of DE's half-collapsed shelter.
*Denied_Existence sits down.
*Denied_Existence presses a button on his chair.
*Denied_Existence waits. From under the chair, metal begins to fold up around it.
*Polarfire Thinks DE is now buried and orders the sprites to stop.
*Denied_Existence presses a second button, then types telemetry into a computer. A massive hole opens in the ground on the surface
<Kyu> 07well they're not.

<Polarfire> THIS CAN'T BE!!
<Polarfire> Alright.
<Polarfire> That is IT.
*Denied_Existence looks through the rear monitor as the bunker's reactor goes critical.
*Polarfire teleports, leaving the parasprites behind
*Polarfire dials a number.
*Denied_Existence watches a mushroom bloom from the uranium mine.
<Polarfire> Hello?
<Denied_Existence> hello
<Denied_Existence> Look up
<Ascendant> haha
<Ascendant> coooome on Kyu D:
<Polarfire> what?? wrong number.

*Denied_Existence presses a button on the control panel
<Ascendant> no one on here has beaten me yet >:
<Kyu> 07lol
<Ascendant> or at least no one that I've went against
*Denied_Existence watches the monitors with a smile as its white cargo spills from the cargo bay
<Lugianite> most inventive minds in the DC comics, but most inventive of all has to be Tony or Howard Stark, or even Norman Osborne
<Polarfire> Hello? yeah Luna listen. I'm calling in a solid you owe me......
*Denied_Existence is sure glad luna is willing to lease him a place on the moon
<Lugianite> Though Crimson Dynamo is pretty good as well
*Denied_Existence continues to watch as pure POPCORN spills down to the earth...

<Lugianite> Modok as well
*Polarfire notices the popcorn.
<Polarfire> GAAAHHHH
*Denied_Existence lands on the moon

*Denied_Existence closes the fan fiction and announces, "And that's how equestrian was made!"

<Denied_Existence> Good RP dude. That was fun.
<Lugianite> but the best I have to give to Dr. Doom
<Polarfire> *the group of fillies around Denied_existence applaud*

<Denied_Existence> Anyway, I need some sleep. I will probably be part of the panel of TheBronyShow on monday...so catch me then if I am!
<Polarfire> oh thats awesome! how'd you get that?
<Denied_Existence> Well...its not for sure yet...but the key is kindness, interest, and thankfulness.
<Polarfire> ah. That usually works. :)
<Polarfire> Well night. I'll cya then
<Denied_Existence> I hope I will see me, and you, too! Night!

<Polarfire> hey dari
<RainBorDash> Yeah?
<Polarfire> how did you make a script that shows EQD updates?
<SoiPony> lol
<RainBorDash> Sockets.
<Polarfire> sockets?
<Polarfire> I dunno what those are but I'm really impressed.
<Polarfire> thats amazing.
<RainBorDash> Open up a connection to EQD using a socket, receive the source code of the page.
<RainBorDash> Then search the line till I get what I'm looking for.
<RainBorDash> In this case the first title it comes accross.
<RainBorDash> Since this will be the latest post.
<RainBorDash> Then post that in chat.
<Polarfire> so are the posts automatic or manual?
<RainBorDash> The "New EQD post: asdf" thing is automatic.
<eXAKR> !digimon
<ScriptBot> eXAKR, you are a 8EmperorGreymon.
<RainBorDash> I've got a timer set up to open a socket to EQD every 30 seconds.
*Polarfire is amazed
<RainBorDash> So the script checks every 30 seconds.
<Polarfire> dude you are a computer god.
<RainBorDash> I used to think sockets were hard.
*Polarfire bows
<RainBorDash> But I found something that explained them well.
<RainBorDash> And gave examples of how they work, etc.
<RainBorDash> So I can understand them now.
<Ascendant> Dorugamon > all
<Ascendant> and also Varodurumon
<Polarfire> Did you learn everything you know from the internet?
<RainBorDash> Well, the internet is one large part, and just experimenting with coding is good too.
<eXAKR> Double failure all the way across the chat
<eXAKR> Oh
<eXAKR> Wow
<eXAKR> Oh my God
<eXAKR> Look at that failure

<drf|laptop> 03WTF is wrong with Katy Perry's music videos, they're always stretched out on MTV and such
<drf|laptop> 03I thought it was just that one video, but this one's doing thes ame thing
<Flareon> and you cant have improvement without improv
<Ascendant> haha, just had a hilarious challenge cup battle against Kyu

<Ascendant> really? .-.
<drf|laptop> 03yes
<drf|laptop> 03well I'm using the Fixedsys font
<drf|laptop> 03it's kinda borky about utf8 LOL
<Freyskol> I'm using Times New Roman lol
<drf|laptop> 03there usedg to be Fixedsys Excelsior but it looks like complete crap on Windwos 7, that's basically an XP-only font XD
<junh1024-XD> what script??
<drf|laptop> 03the one that put the link to that jpb
<drf|laptop> 03*jpg
<junh1024-XD> nah, iy doesn't repond to colour
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah Freyskol, as much as fixed-width fonts suck for most practical applications, I think it works really well for IRC
<drf|laptop> 03fixedsys just looks the best to me, prolly because it's the mIRC default and changing it just looked weird to me
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<drf|laptop> 03the guy who directed God of War 3 went to some random college?
<drf|laptop> 03interesting XD
<Aurora> 6my mom went to the same high school steven spielberg went to
<Aurora> 6</random>
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03well it was this ad on TV
<drf|laptop> 03for something called Art Institute
<drf|laptop> 03which.. sounds sketchy as heck
<drf|laptop> 03because real colleges don't advertise on MTV
<Aurora> 6that's not sketchy at all lol
<Aurora> 6AI is one of the top art schools in the country
<Aurora> 6as to why they advertise...no idea
<drf|laptop> 03there's probably over 9000 colleges by that na...what
<Aurora> 6granted, it's not Cal Arts or anything
<Aurora> 6but it's a really good school
<drf|laptop> 03well the commercial looked like it was a low budget thing
<Aurora> 6but to that, I give a big fat nope
<drf|laptop> 03which makes me think sketchy as frick
<drf|laptop> 03but whatever you say LOL
<Light_Latias> 12"there are many institutes of art but there is only ONE Art Institute!"
*Light_Latias 12hides
<drf|laptop> 03LOL these commercials are so dumb
<Aurora> 6yeah um, AI is extremely costly
<Flareon> my dad went to the same HS as Geroge Lucas
<Aurora> 6they're the most advertised school I know, doing every bit of marketing including high school visits
<drf|laptop> 03then they should totally be able to afford commrecials that look like they cost more than $10 to make :|
<Aurora> 6but when you look at the tuition page, put in your major, and find that the total tuition and fees hits 99k
<Aurora> 6there's a problem LOL
<Aurora> 6although I think that literally IS a problem
<Aurora> 6but tuition alone for a year is 25k
<drf|laptop> 03dear lord
*drf|laptop turns off MTV Hits
<drf|laptop> 03I cannot stand this video
<Aurora> 6I'm paying 23k a year at fullerton for tuition, housing, books, everything
<drf|laptop> 03the one for Katy Perry's newer song Last Friday night
<drf|laptop> 03because it totally makes fun of people with bracdes etc :|}
<drf|laptop> 03*braces
<drf|laptop> 03and that's just not cool
<Aurora> 6speaking of friday

<drf|laptop> 03anyway bbl
<NightSeas> 12derp
<NightSeas> 12Hello Umbreon
<EpicStatsGuy> <Drake> I'm angry.
<Glacymr> 12hi super NightSeas of doom
<drfsupercenter> 03Glacymr
<Glacymr> 12hi
<drfsupercenter> 03I was eating some M&Ms, and that filling on my tooth started hurting like crazy x.x
<Glacymr> 12sounds like sensitivity
<Glacymr> 12have you have candy before?
<drfsupercenter> 03yes.
<drfsupercenter> 03but it started hurting before too
<Glacymr> 12then that blows that idea
<drfsupercenter> 03ever since I Got the filling
<drfsupercenter> 03I dunno if maybe they didn't do a good job of it and left some caviry intact :/
<drfsupercenter> 03*cafity
<drfsupercenter> 03*CAVITY
<drfsupercenter> 03God
<Glacymr> 12i have a filling that hurts whenever i drink something cold
<Glacymr> 12:/
<drfsupercenter> 03so that's normal? x.x
<Glacymr> 12no
<Glacymr> 12it shouldn't
<Aurora> 6how long ago did you get the filling
<drfsupercenter> 03maybe 2 months?
<Glacymr> 12me, july 2nd
<Aurora> 6thats not good
<drfsupercenter> 03at who, me or him
<Aurora> 6you
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Glacymr> 12agreed
<Aurora> 6cold temperatures do that
<Aurora> 6sugar shouldnt
<drfsupercenter> 03if I even touch it
<drfsupercenter> 03with my finger
<drfsupercenter> 03it hurts a little
<Aurora> 6um
<Aurora> 6get that checked
<Aurora> 6before you have to have what my best friend had done
<Glacymr> 12if your tooth all of a sudden falls out
<Aurora> 6it was miserable
<Glacymr> 12i'd get that checked too
<Aurora> 6no
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like in the way back of my mouth, my toothbrush can't reach there
<drfsupercenter> 03Aurora, what was that?
<Aurora> 6he'd need a root canal first
<drfsupercenter> 03I've heard that term, what IS a root canal?
<Aurora> 6if a filling isn't done right, the cavity decays inward
<Glacymr> 12dentist Aurora at our service :)
<Aurora> 6basically
<Aurora> 6the tooth decays inside out
<Aurora> 6but so deep into the tooth that they need to drill into the root
<Aurora> 6it's horrible
*Flareon cringes
<Aurora> 6but the pain of an infected root is worse
<Flareon> I popped in at the wrong time
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah see
<drfsupercenter> 03when they drilled it
<drfsupercenter> 03it didn't even hurt
<Ascendant> .-.
<Aurora> 6if your cavity is causing trouble, get it checked now before it gets really bad
<drfsupercenter> 03and I didn't get novacaine either
<Aurora> 6that's nothing new
<Aurora> 6I had that for my first cavity
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03supposedly it hurts
<drfsupercenter> 03for some people
<drfsupercenter> 03getting cavities drilled
<Aurora> 6depends on what part of the cavity, and on the person
<drfsupercenter> 03what kinda bugged me though
<drfsupercenter> 03is he gave me a novacaine shot for my other cavity
<drfsupercenter> 03and it didn't even kick into effect
<drfsupercenter> 03until after I left
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<drfsupercenter> 03so I leave there with a numb mouth and I'm like FFS
<Aurora> 6lol
<Aurora> 6sounds a lot like mine too
<drfsupercenter> 03drinking water was so hard
<drfsupercenter> 03so when I went back to get the second one drilled
<Aurora> 6my second cavity, he gave me 3 shots before it kicked in, 15 minutes later
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like you know what, forget it, don't give me the shot
<Glacymr> 12XD
<drfsupercenter> 03but hm
<drfsupercenter> 03I guess I'll tell my mom to call the dentist
<drfsupercenter> 03problem is my classes :/;
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't have much of a break between the morning and night class x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03and well
<drfsupercenter> 03if the cavity was still there
<drfsupercenter> 03would it hurt when I touch it like that?
<Aurora> 6if it's getting inflamed yes
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Aurora> 6the cavity is probably pressing up against the root, or the thin part of the tooth that's left
<Aurora> 6which would in turn press against the root
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, the two cavities I had, I never even felt anything
<drfsupercenter> 03so Iw as like "wait, what, I have cavities?"
<Aurora> 6the more that decays in there, the more root is exposed
<drfsupercenter> 03so this is odd :/
<Freyskol> o_O
<Glacymr> 12Freyskol is thinking "forget this convo, i'm gonna play LoL'
<Freyskol> Nah.
<Glacymr> 12WoW?
<drfsupercenter> 03EW WORLD OF WARCRACK
<Glacymr> 12why do people think it's addictive
<Glacymr> 12it's not
<drfsupercenter> 03because people waste their lives playing it
<Freyskol> I'm thinking Romantic Children is a great song
<Freyskol> eh
<Freyskol> I got bored o fit
<Glacymr> 12i played it for like a month
<Glacymr> 12quit for 6 months, tried again for another month
<Freyskol> after getting three characters to 85
<Glacymr> 12quit again, it's nothing special
<drfsupercenter> 03well you're prolly one of few people who thinks like that
<Flareon> nini all
<Flareon> Flareon out
<Glacymr> 12i'd probably play it
<Glacymr> 12if it was cheaper
<Glacymr> 12personally i don't think it's worth the 15 dollars a month
<Freyskol> I wasn't paying for it
<Freyskol> <.<
<Freyskol> >.>
<Aurora> 6lol
<drfsupercenter> 03even if it were free I wouldn't play it
<Glacymr> 12if it was free i'd toy with it
<Glacymr> 12i wouldn't play it
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate MMOs in general
<Freyskol> BTW, if WoW doesn't open up a totally free thing
<Glacymr> 12another thing to add to your hate list :P
<Freyskol> It's gonna die
<Freyskol> :P
<Glacymr> 12your love list is like 5 things
<Glacymr> 12then everything else is hate
<Freyskol> Free MMO's are taking the market right now
<Aurora> 6especially with games like dragon's nest coming out
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Freyskol> League of Legends is by far the most prominant free game right now.
<Aurora> 6that too
<drfsupercenter> 03Glacymr, I don't hate everything, it just seems that way since lots of people here like stuff tha tI hate :P
<Glacymr> 12XD
<Glacymr> 12when you find the light-latias fanclub site community let me know
*Glacymr hides
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not obsessed or anything
<drfsupercenter> 03:|
<drfsupercenter> 03of course she was trying to get me to admit that earlier and I was like no
<Freyskol> So you ADMIT IT
<drfsupercenter> 03no?
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Glacymr> 12nah, i don't see the traits of an obsession in drf
<drfsupercenter> 03I think this guy in the movie ATL is Keith David
<drfsupercenter> 03as in
<drfsupercenter> 03the voice of Goliath in Gargoyles
<drfsupercenter> 03kinda an odd role for him XD
<Glacymr> 12the only obsession he has is the obsession of having to have everything high def and high quality digitally
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, that's called quality wh*ring
<Soyuz> Drake; Dero
<Freyskol> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03http://sale.images.woot.com/Red_Revenge3z3Detail.png

<drfsupercenter> 03read that comment by pecosdave
<drfsupercenter> 03finally someone else thinks like me
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd give him a thumbs up if I could
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Glacymr> 12personally if you pay attention to apple
<Glacymr> 12they are only going to want to peeve you off more
<drfsupercenter> 03I wasn't
<drfsupercenter> 03that's some random Chinese phone

<Dman> !33
<Dman> !bird
<Dman> >_< now what?
<prince-dari> You tell me. :o
<Dman> How the heck does all this relate to the original string of numbars?
<Dman> 68747470 31262677 77772564 65646961 66697265 25636664 26367966 31713864 78787668 39623163 65?
<prince-dari> That's for you to work out. :P
<Dman> =[ ok...
<RDash> Haha,I've been trying to figure that out XD
<Dman> lol RDash
<Dman> Welp, if you go on /chat/ you'll see where i'm up to, RDash
<prince-dari> It wouldn't be any fun if I told you and it got insta solver. :P
<prince-dari> solved*
<Dman> Also prince-dari i was supposed to do the friendship report trivia questions today >_<
<prince-dari> This shouldn't take that long.
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Maybe.
<Dman> example : In 'The Ticket Master,' Twilight's Friendship report says that having more [something] than your friends can make you feel pretty awful. Having more what?
<Dman> oh and it's 4 i have so far actually
<prince-dari> Ooh, cool.
<Dman> >_< curse youuuuu. my ultimate weakness
<Dman> Oh yea, the trivia's coming along great!
<Dman> hmmmm
<Dman> how do these relate to the original string of 82 numbers
<Dman> also, answer is 'blessings'
<Dman> ::P
<prince-dari> Ah.
<prince-dari> I wouldn't have known that. XD
<Dman> Bene :P
<Dman> (good in italian. something I love to say for soem reason)
<prince-dari> It means well in Latin.
<Dman> (trivia's s'posed to be hard, rite ? )
<Dman> And latin, yes :P
<Dman> grammar school = have to do 5 years of Latun
<prince-dari> Well it'll have harder and easier questions I suppose.
<Dman> Yea some are 'what colour is twi's eyes' i think
<prince-dari> Just depends on what you know anyway.
<Dman> ^
<Dman> one is : When Twilight became enraged in 'Feeling Pinkie Keen,' and when she drank some hot sauce in 'Friendship is Magic Part 1,' what pokémon did she resemble?
<Dman> But im gonna go back to THE CODE!
<Dman> bird is 2 9 18 4 ... ?

<Dman> sorta...
<Dman> wait
<prince-dari> "10, 12, 14, 22, 24, 42, 46, 48, 50, 52, 58, 78, 80
<prince-dari> Looks as though I made a mistake with the last 3 numbers, it should be 60, 80, and 82.
<prince-dari> "
<Dman> OH COME ON 8<
<Dman> ok ok

<Dman> 10, 12, 14, 22, 24, 42, 46, 48, 50, 52, 60, 80, 82 are all even numbers, and 82 in original code, and Hex works with 2number/letters at a time

<Sathi> 7Hows your game?
*Pegacorn stares Sathi,ready to draw his pistol out as the "Good,Bad and Ugly" stare-down theme plays
<Pegacorn> *stares at
<Pegacorn> My game went well....
<Sathi> 7but?
<Pegacorn> I died after killing 10 other robots
<Pegacorn> I mean Mechs.
<Sathi> 7aww... how come?
<Sathi> 7hard mode activated?
<Sathi> 7no idea though don't play many games
<Sathi> 7:)
<Sathi> 7Just WoW / Left4ponies and sometimes some TF2
<Pegacorn> No.....the difficulty is upped every time you kill a mech.
<Sathi> 7Oh I see
<Pegacorn> Offtopic,but how come "My little Pony" becomes good,and "Transformers" becomes bad nowadays?
<Pegacorn> My fragile little mind does not comprend that.
<Sathi> 7well.. transformers is not my cup of tea
<Pegacorn> Old Transformers are my cup of tea thought.
<Sathi> 7i've seen the movies with my bf though
<Pegacorn> The live-action ones?
<Pegacorn> Guess what's my most hated movie of all time!
<Pegacorn> Transformers:Revenge of the Fallen,that's what!
<Pegacorn> RANDOM VID TIME!
<Pegacorn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDHDif7fmo&feature=channel_video_title
<Sathi> 7I figured that :p
<Sathi> 7why though?
<Pegacorn> I saw that movie when it came out on DVD.I was a HUGE fan of Transformers at the time,and i was incredibly hyped for the movie,then i saw it.Dumb action,terrible SFX,horrible actors,and to top it all off,a Decepticon that says fuck.Oh,and Optimus dies.I cried and ran away,then went to play on my PS2.
<Pegacorn> Thank god for Dragon Ball Z.
<Pegacorn> It cheered me up.
<Sathi> 7aww
<Sathi> 7Well I did not like the movie aswell
<Pegacorn> That movie made me incredibly bitter.
<Sathi> 7but luckilly for you as a fan it was just a movie...
<Sathi> 7I wonder if they ever make a WoW movie how the huge fanbase will react on it
<Pegacorn> They probably be all like "OMG THIS SUCKS THE NEW RACE ISN'T THERE IHATE THIS SO MUCH!"
<Pegacorn> *I HATE
<Pegacorn> *They'll
<Pegacorn> I don't remember the new race's name.
<Pegacorn> Warren or something...
<Sathi> 7Worgen
<Sathi> 7and Goblins
<Pegacorn> Oh right.
<Sathi> 7Goblins are epic though
<Sathi> 7so much fun
<Sathi> 7why yes i'm horde
<Pegacorn> I never saw then in the game.I played the trial version,didn't like it alot,but still good.
<Pegacorn> *them
<Sathi> 7well the trial changed
<Sathi> 7you can play as long as you want now for free
<Sathi> 7till the lvl cap
<Sathi> 7 20
<Sathi> 7pretty neat if you ask me
<Sathi> 7+ if you decide to buy wow you get the second expansion for free giving you the freedom to lvl to 70
<Pegacorn> Ok,but i'm not that much of a fan.You're free to have your opinion though.
<Sathi> 7SOON! you will though ;)
<Pegacorn> Waddaya mean?
<Sathi> 7You will all be WoW-ified
*Sathi 7nods
<Sathi> 7When did you play?
<Pegacorn> 2 months ago.
<Pegacorn> I was a lvl 4 undead rogue
<Sathi> 7hmm that still recent
<Sathi> 7what did you like / dislike?
<Pegacorn> Like:Customization,quests.
<Pegacorn> Dislike:Graphics,etc.
<Sathi> 7graphics aren't that bad?
<Sathi> 7it's just a bit comic / fantasy style
<Sathi> 7that's actually what I like
<Sathi> 7you picked the good side of the game though!
*Sathi 7is pleased
<Pegacorn> Yea,i like comic/fantasy graphic style,it's just the graphics are blocky and stiff.
<Sathi> 7blocky and stiff.. I agree the characters need an update.. but the world is simply amazing
<Pegacorn> True dat.
*Sathi 7is looking up some screenies
<Sathi> 7http://blastr.com/assets_c/2009/08/Wow_Abyssal_Maw-thumb-550x296-22691.jpg

<ReticentSmolder> you mean pony or non-pony?
<mib_rf7tmy> pony of course :P
<mib_rf7tmy> or, non-pony
<mib_rf7tmy> just interested, and bored
<ReticentSmolder> well, I've got 2 fics starring SilverMane, who's a regular here

<mib_rf7tmy> Will SilverMane's serious commissioned one be availably publicly?
<ReticentSmolder> @Steven_magnet ooooh, I *KNOW* its sooo true!
<mib_rf7tmy> or is it a private affair?
<ReticentSmolder> if you want, I've got a bit of it done but not much
<ReticentSmolder> I have a self-insert role also
*ReticentSmolder shameless publicity /gasp
<Barry> Hi
<mib_rf7tmy> I mean when it's finished :P
<ReticentSmolder> errrr, that's a big *when* I'm not sure if I want to continue it or the CMC fic at this point
<ReticentSmolder> btw, is this RBD?
<mib_rf7tmy> I'll take the updates on the you/DSNesmith written one, since I was here for all that as it was started, but I'd like to read the silvermane commission all at once :L
<mib_rf7tmy> everyone is RBD. RBD is a notion, a feeling. A state of mind.
<ReticentSmolder> ...so yes?
<ReticentSmolder> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/original/5779_-_macro_pinkie_pie.png
<mib_rf7tmy> I'm just mib_rf7tmy
<ReticentSmolder> well, the serious fic got about...mmmm...3 pages in before I ran out of ideas and went to bed, then when I woke up I had other crap and I just keep putting it off
<ReticentSmolder> I've actually been updating a fantasy fic, original setting not fanfic, fairly often, or at least adding to it
<ReticentSmolder> but yeah, between the 3 projects I don't know which to just stick with and finish, the fantasy one is probably going to be a whole lot longer than the other two
<ReticentSmolder> k, that's it, I'm going to do some WRITING!
<mib_rf7tmy> but srsly RBD is everywhere and nowhere
<mib_rf7tmy> in the shadows, under the spotlights.
<mib_rf7tmy> fair enough thb
<mib_rf7tmy> tbh*
<mib_rf7tmy> and the CMC one seemed to just lose a bit of its strenth
<mib_rf7tmy> strength*
<ReticentSmolder> ummmm...help me out here, of the 2 fics in progress that are pony-related which one would you have me finish?
<ReticentSmolder> the non-CMC one will carry some more serious undertones
<Pizzapony> hey photofinishhim
*ReticentSmolder feels creative juices flowing...either that or the mike n ikes
*photoFINISHHIM WOOT
<Pizzapony> probably creative juices, unless you are on the toilet
<ReticentSmolder> ...why would I bring my desktop into the bathroom? lol
<photoFINISHHIM> oatmeal? are you CRAZY?!
<Pizzapony> cuz that would be baws?
*ReticentSmolder totally doesn't have
*photoFINISHHIM multiple personalities
<Pizzapony> also,i'm on a friends laptop. showing him what i know of the herd, even though he is my senior by about 5 months
*ReticentSmolder hehehe
*photoFINISHHIM hahaha
<SilverMane> what was that about multiple personalities?
<ReticentSmolder> Yeah, the herd mind
<photoFINISHHIM> is great and powerful
<ReticentSmolder> Not like,
<photoFINISHHIM> that poser Trixie
<ReticentSmolder> Finish him we must,
<photoFINISHHIM> and burn the remains!
<Pizzapony> Trixie does not have anyting on Silvermane. Silvermane is the greatest thing ever, and SilverMane dislikes the sexy trixie for Trixie speaks to highly of Trixie, even though Silvermane is clearly better.

*ReticentSmolder Nopony appeared.
*ReticentSmolder He raised his hoof again, when the door opened slowly of its own accord. Silvermane stepped inside, looking around for the owner. "Oh, not again, freakin' prank callers." After setting the stack of pizzas by the door he decided to explore the rest of the house to see if the customer might be further in.

*ReticentSmolder Presently, he noticed a door standing ajar, and moved to investigate. The door revealed a stairwell leading down to a basement which was full of disturbing contraptions, machines that Silvermane had never seen before. Stepping forward, he glanced nervously around. "Uh... anypony home?"

*ReticentSmolder ReticentSmolder sidled up to the dashing prince. He may not have noticed him, but Reticent wasn't about to give up this fight. While they were walking he nuzzled the prince's mane, much to his surprise.

<SilverMane> ReticentSmolder, it's not that hard to ship yourself as long as you remember character personalities. Such as when I wrote my own shipper last week, although i need to edit it
<ReticentSmolder> weeeeeeeeeeeell, I'm not really sure about my own character ReticentSmolder
<ReticentSmolder> oh, can you copypasta images without links, like ones you have saved?
<ReticentSmolder> because I have a WIP likeness of myself saved
<SilverMane> well as you noticed, i wrote SilverMane's shipper using the personality others have written for him, so if some people write about you, you can use that for non-serious fic
<mib_rf7tmy> 0>mfw

<ReticentSmolder> oh, btw, I came up with a corny title for your shipfic SilverMane, it's entitled "A Silver Lining"

<Daxton> trololololololololol
*ReticentSmolder Dawn peeked through the window onto a light-brown pegasus stallion, his front half hanging over the edge of a moderately sized bed seemingly unaware of the blood rushing to his head. The light struck his eyelids, and the filtered rays coaxed the pony out of his fitful dream.
*ReticentSmolder Opening his eyes with a groan, Silver Mane was suddenly hit by a wave of vertigo at the sight of the ground before him, causing his other half to slide off the bed with a crash. ‘I should really look into sleep therapy,’ he thought idly as he brushed his signature mane out of his eyes.
<mib_rf7tmy> 0New Dari Bot Post: 2722
<Dashite> I know exactly how that feels Silvermane in the story...
*ReticentSmolder The window beside his bed looked out onto a small avenue in the small town of Ponyville, the sun just now rising above the brightly colored roof tops.
<SilverMane> i've done that. it was fun. then my nerves recovered
*ReticentSmolder Silver Mane pulled himself to his hooves and scanned his Spartan apartment for the thick oak door that lead to the common hallway. Nuzzling the door softly, so as not to wake the other boarders, he snuck down the hallway towards a door at the far end.
<ReticentSmolder> I wasn't sure if I wanted it 'Spartan' or utilitarian
<SilverMane> spartan is proper, if you mean minimalist or emptyish
<Dashite> Either way it shouldn't be capitalized.
<ReticentSmolder> @Dashite but its named after a people
*ReticentSmolder After knocking once with a yawn and feeling confident he wouldn’t barge in on somepony, Silver pushed the door open and took a quick glance in the mirror above the water trough. His mane was a scraggly with bed head as he worked a brush with his teeth along the edges he could reach.
<ReticentSmolder> yeah, and word auto-corrects it :P
*ReticentSmolder . A few minutes of brushing and preening his wings later he was feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world while he trotted down the hallway and downstairs.
<RainBroDash> WAT
<RainBroDash> I LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE
<SoiPony> what...?
*ReticentSmolder The stairs bent to the right and led into a small kitchen that the boarders shared. To Silver’s surprise he saw Reticent Smolder, a recently moved in unicorn with a shaggy burnt-orange mane and a burgundy coat, fixing a simple breakfast of eggs and oatmeal on the stove.
<RainBroDash> 10BACK IN TEAL GLORY
<SoiPony> NO WAY
<ReticentSmolder> self-insert powah HASTUDO
<SoiPony> inb4 uber troll
<SilverMane> MAI WAIFU
<Dashite> Word in this instance is wrong. You are using spartan as an adjective so it shouldn't be capitalized.
*ReticentSmolder “Morning Reticent, didn’t expect to see you up this early, any special plans?” Silver mane teased. He met Reticent a few days ago but the pony rarely left his room from what he could tell.
<ReticentSmolder> @Dashit, good to know, I'll correct it
*RainBroDash 10braces for ubertroll
<ReticentSmolder> Dashite*
*SilverMane thinks he should be bracing for impact instead.
*ReticentSmolder “Uh…yeah you could say that,” Reticent stammered, clearly not expecting anypony else this early. “I hope you don’t mind my cooking, feel free to have some if you want.”
*SilverMane le glomp
*mib_rf7tmy 10licks silvermane
<SilverMane> oh don't do that, you might get a rise out of my feathers

<SilverMane> on the anon account
<mib_rf7tmy> 0silvermane the colour script doesn't do that
<mib_rf7tmy> 0it's based on nick not mod status
*ReticentSmolder Silver Mane smiled and took a bowl out of a nearby cupboard, glancing at the nervous unicorn as he dipped it into the warm mixture and setting it on the table nearby. “Well thanks! I wasn’t really looking forward to the same old dry oats I eat every morning before heading out and this is sure a welcome change.”
<SilverMane> Nittany_Tiger, please stand up off of my, before my wings get any more bent out of shape.
<mib_rf7tmy> 0and also: reticent I know he unbanned me, but I unbanned me various times too, he had a script which auto kickbanned my hostname
<mib_pasmmp> 4Whee colour!
<Nittany_Tiger> Ok.
<Dashite> It warned me.
<mib_rf7tmy> 0Yup.
<mib_rf7tmy> 0It's still there
<SilverMane> thanks Nittany_Tiger, don't mind the feathers that are standing up. it's not anything, don't worry.
*ReticentSmolder Sitting in a chair at the large oak table in the center of the kitchen, Silver thought about what he was going to do today. He was between two jobs as he held a seasonal summer shift with the weather patrol and it wasn’t quite time to help the various farm ponies until fall when they hired him as a farmhand.
<mib_rf7tmy> 0SilverMane: lol
<Nittany_Tiger> Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrright.
*ReticentSmolder It wasn’t that he didn’t have the bits to get by, he made a good living between the two job seasons, but he grew bored easily in the lull it created.

<Nittany_Tiger> Weather is a summer job? I didn't know weather took time off. I guess that's why Texas is dry.
<prince-dari> >Run up mountain in 10 minutes. Run down mountain and AROUND another, before going to the top of that one. Sprain ankle at the top of that mountain. My dad and I climb straight down the mountain through miles of waist level thorny shit. Have a nosebleed on the way down.

<prince-dari> >get to the bottom of mountain, cut up a bit, having done all this on one hour sleep.

*ReticentSmolder Reticent Smolder chose to sit down with his plate of eggs and his own bowl in the midst of the other pony’s reverie. Seeing the unicorn in front of him again, Silver attempted to make small talk to get to know his aloof roommate.

*ReticentSmolder “So Reticent, what’s with all the extra food, have some lucky mare in mind?” Silver ragged, trying not to enjoy it too much at the awkward stallion’s expense.
<Nittany_Tiger> Though I'm against weather modification (in real life. I'll do it in a heartbeat in fantasy land.)

<prince-dari> ReticentSmolder: orly? :o
*ReticentSmolder Reticent looked up from his oatmeal with a blush, “Ummm, yeah, I mean, I hope, there’s this one mare I’ve been trying to ask out for awhile but I never had any idea of what we would do. I finally talked to her yesterday and she agreed to have a potluck with her friends today.”
<SilverMane> Nittany_Tiger, fund it!
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm broke, but I'll try.
<ReticentSmolder> @prince-dari I'm a terribad singer you know: the hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiils are aliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive, with the sound ooooof muuuuuuuuu~sic
<Nittany_Tiger> I am in a college town. Plenty of karaoke places around.
*Nittany_Tiger grabs yellow pages.
*ReticentSmolder “Haha, you stud, I hope it goes well,” Silver said between bites. The two enjoyed the rest of their meal in silence before Reticent got up and started to put the rest of the oatmeal into a large carrying container. Silver Mane trotted out of the kitchen while he was busy and into the common room before pushing his way through the building’s wide front doo
<Nittany_Tiger> We're going to have fun!
*ReticentSmolder Silver Mane trotted out of the kitchen while he was busy and into the common room before pushing his way through the building’s wide front doors and out into the early autumn sun.
<SilverMane> inbr i called RS a stud
*ReticentSmolder Unsure of how he wanted to spend his day, Silver decided on flying around town in search of somepony he knew or whatever looked interesting. With a powerful beat of his wings, he lifted off of the ground and over the heads of several earth ponies before clearing the rooftops and into the great blue expanse above.
<ReticentSmolder> @SilverMane you were joking
<SilverMane> i know, i can tell, but still makes me giggle

<Dman> RainBroDash - with our powers combined!
<prince-dari> Welp, there's only one place there could be more clues hiding in what I've posted.
<Dman> Hey SilverMane!
*SilverMane hugs RainBroDash
<Dman> Still havent read dman x silvermane lol
<Dman> Prince-Dari ...
<prince-dari> Dman: Eugh, don't work with that non-existant person.
<SilverMane> that would be horrible Dman
<ReticentSmolder> L2 LURK MOAR BAD LURKERS
<RainBroDash> 10dman i can try and help if you want
<Dman> SilverMane - it already exists, bjornfort made it
<Dman> Yes RainBroDash!
<Dman> Where part 2?
<RainBroDash> 10I'll have to read the thread though first
<SilverMane> i refuse to accept his existance, dman. bjornfort doesn't exist
<Dman> in /chat/?
<RainBroDash> 10i know dari will have made it blindingly obvious from the way he worded something
<RainBroDash> 10brb
<Dman> also, yea rainbrodash, please halp! http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/36384990.html
<Dman> RainBroDash but it isn't! not for me!
<Nittany_Tiger> What's with the number?
<Dman> Nittany_tiger, read the whole thread, and it's a link i think
<Dman> unless there's more to it
<ReticentSmolder> >mfw riddle http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/original/Hurr_and_a_durr.jpg
<ReticentSmolder> oh SilverMane, do you have any name ideas more related to board games?
<Dman> reticentsmolder, >mfw riddle! http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/original/1299045946279.jpg
<Dman> I LOVE RIDDLES
<Nittany_Tiger> hex works in pairs: So 26 = 2F in your world somewhere. 2F base 16 = 16*2 = 32. (lololol)
<Nittany_Tiger> 232! It's when 166 and 2 fuck.
<ReticentSmolder> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/original/13001130535.jpg
<Nittany_Tiger> Math porn!
<Dman> lol, x = sex xP
<Dman> but gais part 2?!?
<Nittany_Tiger> I bet in this age, in middle school, average math grades would increase if math was pornographic.
<SilverMane> i'll think of some, but i have to go soon. peace
<Nittany_Tiger> X = fuck for instance.
<ReticentSmolder> later SilverMane
<ReticentSmolder> so RainBroDash, now that SilverMane isn't here we should write a clopfic
<Nittany_Tiger> 16 and 2 kiss and make 19. 16 and 2 fuck and give you 32. Now to properly illustrate 16^2, I'll need to get some parental permission. :p
<RainBroDash> 10inderdaad
<ReticentSmolder> >also because I'm bored
<RainBroDash> 10clopfics aohy!
<RainBroDash> 10shoy*
<RainBroDash> 10ahoy*
<RainBroDash> 10wow
<ReticentSmolder> lol
<Dashite> ONE MORE TIME!
<Nittany_Tiger> Might do it.
<ReticentSmolder> whye won'te I stope addinge E's everywheree?
<Dashite> I don't know but I was having the same problem every time I tried to write the word lag.
<RainBroDash> 10also: dman. I knew I'd suck at dari's puzzle. I'm thinking about it while eating this icecream, and I'll get back to you
<Dman> Icecream is good :P
<Dashite> And I almost did it again. Caught myself just before I pressed the key.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm not going to worry about the puzzle since it might spoil Inception.
<Dman> OH hey Dashite!
<ReticentSmolder> @RainBroDash mind if I join? http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/original/21623_-_artist_megasweet_fluttershy_ice_cream_megasweet_whyboner.jpg
<Dashite> OHAI DMAN.
<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder as long as you take off that FLOOTERSHAI costume, it's ugly as shit :3

<RainBroDash> 10Fluttershy -only just- lost to rarity for Worst Pony 2011 (RBD's own competition in his head, composed of primarily his own opinion)
<SoiPony> lol
<ReticentSmolder> @RBD http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-what-did-you-say-about-fluttershy.jpg
<RainBroDash> 10meh :3
<ReticentSmolder> my fav's in order: Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Twilight Sparkle, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, Lyra, Applejack, Photo Finish, all other OC or background
<ReticentSmolder> Applejack loses to Lyra, I hear enough Texan accents as is
<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder I kinda agree with dat Applejack
<RainBroDash> 10But rarity is even worse than AJ
<RainBroDash> 10i guess fluttershy > AJ > rarity
<ReticentSmolder> Rarity...has her own charm if you work around some of her awful bits early on
<ReticentSmolder> well, AJ lags behind in my list because of my Texan bias dontchaknow.jpg
<Dman> RainBroDash why don't I love your shit! Fluttershy is best pony
<ReticentSmolder> RainBroDash, be careful, fluttershy will rape you with love http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/134/181/12860%20-%20flutterage%20fluttershy%20parody%20The_Hulk.jpg?1308034848
<RainBroDash> 10but (Vinyl Scratch >) RD > (COLGATE IS SO CUTE :3 >) Pinkie > Twilight > Fluttershy > AJ > Rarity
<ReticentSmolder> d'oh, I meant to add Scratch, easily right behind AJ, maybe above her actually
<ReticentSmolder> @RBD y u no Twilight?
<RainBroDash> 10twilight isn't that bad
<RainBroDash> 10she's in top half of my mane 6
<RainBroDash> 10but she's not as godlike as RD of course, and she's a bit behind pinkie i guess
<Dman> !Advice
<Dman> !ADVICE!
<Dman> Y U NO
<Dman> RainBrODash - errypony best pony
<Nittany_Tiger> RD > Luna, PP, Fluttershy > Everyone Else.
<Dman> lol
<Dman> Hurray for scripting! : D
<RainBroDash> 10@dman this fileception b/s isn't really making that much sense to me, aside from the blindingly obvious, which it isn't
<Dman> what's the blindingly obvious bit?
<Dman> also, if you're doing it / even if not, do you have Skype?
<RainBroDash> 10well what -would- be blindingly obvious, like opening a hidden .rar file within the file
<RainBroDash> 10but that didn't work, there wasn't one
<RainBroDash> 10Dman, what's the sum total of file size of actual important flash filey business you found in the file?
<RainBroDash> 10just so we can see if there's anything else in that file, or if we should be searching for a different download link for part 2 instead
<RainBroDash> 10>idk if any of this makes sense, but it's my only logical next step
<Dman> RainBroDash i have a pic of it opened in SOTHINK SWF DECOMPILER, what do you mean 'what's the sum total of file size of actual important flash filey business you found in the file?'
<RainBroDash> 10I mean, can you tell how many kb the flash file takes up?
<prince-dari> The flash file i in two part dm-
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Wut
<Nittany_Tiger> Don't trust puzzles with dowloads. Dari might be trying to build a botnet for DDoS attacks! (j/k).
<prince-dari> is*
<prince-dari> Nittany_Tiger: MWUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA :P
<D_man> prince-dari whuuuh
<prince-dari> IT'S ALL PART OF MY PLAN FOR WORLD DOMINATION!
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm too smart for you!
<D_man> RainBroDash and I are all wuting
<RainBroDash> 10and lol@dari
<D_man> RBD i dc/d just now
<D_man> did you reply to my 'what do you mean' question
<D_man> ?
<RainBroDash> 10"<RainBroDash>: I mean, can you tell how many kb the flash file takes up? "
<prince-dari> The flash file is in two part D_man, the second part can't be inside the first part.
<prince-dari> Although that would have been a good idea.
<prince-dari> I should have done that. XD
<prince-dari> Meh, oh well.
<prince-dari> :P
<RainBroDash> 10@dari unless it's in a rar file hidden within the extensionless file
<RainBroDash> 10l2cmd
<RainBroDash> 10:3
<prince-dari> So are you working with...RAINBRO... on this now then?

<Nittany_Tiger> Yes.
<Nittany_Tiger> I've never done shell code though I've had times I could have used it.
*ReticentSmolder RBD didn't know what Rainbow Dash needed this late at night, just that it was important. He had been curious, if not excited, when he received her letter asking him to come over that night.
<Nittany_Tiger> Like right now, I could learn Python, so I can run all of the codes I use in my thesis in one command.
<Nittany_Tiger> Or use Perl.
<RimBlifDerp> >mfw dari didn't use a "copy /b image.png+ rar.rar final.png" command to make a file within a file :3

<Nittany_Tiger> Zip files are files within a file.
*ReticentSmolder He alighted on the cloud stoop to her mansion in the sky, carefully tucking his wings in and smoothing back his mane before ringing her doorbell.

<Nittany_Tiger> I'm thinking tarballs.
<D_man> !advice
<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder, no I wasn't D:
<RainBroDash> 10sowwy ReticentSmolder XD I was defying dari
<RainBroDash> 10I'll scroll up
<Nittany_Tiger> Damn you real life. I actually tried putting a .zip in a .rar, and the computer gave me an error.
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Nittany_Tiger> Might work in Linux.
<prince-dari> A zip in a rar in a txt file.
<D_man> is it?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<D_man> thout not
<Nittany_Tiger> I was trying a zipped .txt file in a .rar file.
<D_man> ok i'll extract the .swf again!
<prince-dari> Lol.
<RainBroDash> 10DMAN.
<prince-dari> You need part 2!
<D_man> RAINBRODASH
<prince-dari> ^
<prince-dari> Eugh
<RainBroDash> 10Do you know how many kb of flash file you have?
<D_man> Also prince-dari is it a new link?
<Nittany_Tiger> AAAH!.rar contains AAAH!.zip, which contains AAAH!.txt.
<D_man> RainBrODash - properties says 35,000KB (36,000KB disk)
<D_man> rainbrodash - explain what you mean 'hoe many kb of flash' please :P
<RainBroDash> 10I mean when you look in your program which extracts the flash file
<RainBroDash> 10how much is there
<RainBroDash> 10because if it's <35.0kb then there's hidden stuff in the file
<RainBroDash> 10that isn't in swf format
<D_man> Oh of course!
<RainBroDash> 10>mfw dari only sees OH OF COURSE, and gets mad at me for helping dman
<RainBroDash> 10tponono
<D_man> also wtf rainbrodash - do you know the answer?
<D_man> if you look at the ponychan chat you can see the pic i uploaded of it extracted btw
<D_man> oh fuck no
<RainBroDash> 10no, by -helping- I mean aiding you in solving the problem by attempting to solve it myself
<RainBroDash> 10but dari hates me atm
<RainBroDash> 10:3
<RonBlarghD00p> RBD was here, Dari is a loser
<D_man> why dari hate you ;(
<prince-dari> Because he won't sing.
<RainBroDash> 10because I won't sing
<RainBroDash> 10lol.
<D_man> Lol
<D_man> i'll sing ... but i can't, but i will if ya want
<D_man> ok prince-dari, i'm biopsying the .swf again
<prince-dari> MFW D_man isn't lacking genitals like RBD.
<RainBroDash> 10MFW DONT GIVE A SHIT FUCK YOU DARI
<RainBroDash> 10mfw wrong computer
<D_man> prince-dari yea, i'm a manly man! I can take anything!
<RunBeepDown> MFW FUCK YOU DARI DONT GIVE A SHIT
<RunBeepDown> and dman, you're not helping <3
<D_man> Your face when after returning today i left again for my daily run. I'm a man!
<D_man> (well, i'm 17 actually :P)
*RunBeepDown is the least manly man
<D_man> : /
<RunBeepDown> OHWELL, TIME FOR PONIES
<RainBroDash> 10anyway
<D_man> Aniway
<D_man> so
<D_man> um
<D_man> just looking at erry line of code in the .swf rite now
<RainBroDash> 10you say you put the biopsy on the chat thread, yeah?
<prince-dari> MFW you're doing it wrong
<D_man> Yes rainbrodash
<RainBroDash> 10MFW no idea who dari is talking to
<prince-dari> Check thread for another hint.
<D_man> oh?
<ReticentSmolder> lol, I'm playing Touhou while checking in on chat and seeing if you guys stop talking about puzzles
<D_man> haha
<ReticentSmolder> mfw> OH SHIT I DIDN'T PAUSE CORRECTLY
<ReticentSmolder> dead
<RainBroDash> 10ok dman, I have zero programming experience.
<ReticentSmolder> I do, I'm a comp sci major
<RainBroDash> 10;_______;
<D_man> ok rainbrodash, yo prince-dari, i have ZERO programming or scripting, or coding experience!
<D_man> : /
<D_man> I'm just a huge puzzle fan
<RainBroDash> 10Reticent, wanna help us with a programming sentence.
<prince-dari> MFW you're not half way through the puzzle yet.
<ReticentSmolder> ...I have 3 years of Java experience, 1 in Python and 1 in C++
<prince-dari> :P
<RainBroDash> 10basically, dari mentioned concatenation, and after googling it I know what it means, but your experience might help us un-muddy the issue
<ReticentSmolder> lol...concatenation is nothing like adding, are we talking strings or integers?
<RainBroDash> 10"MAYBE SILVER WORKED OUT A CLUE! However instead of just "CAT", it's actually concatenate. *HINT* *HINT*"
<RainBroDash> 10reticent, MFW I KNOW NOTHING.
<D_man> prince-dari 0_______0 what?
<ReticentSmolder> well, are the numbers actual numbers or are they characters? like 'a' or 'Þ'
<prince-dari> So my latest clue SHOULD tell you how the fileception works.
<RainBroDash> 10fuck knows
<D_man> yea that 'silver clue' was completely not understandable : /
<D_man> ie should?
<D_man> it should? *
<ReticentSmolder> well, I guess I'm involved now, someone post me a link
<prince-dari> Then, with the other clues I've given you should be able to work it out.
<D_man> where tha HECK did silver get the '1999' from?
<RunBeepDown> YEAAAAAAH Dari except we've never used a concatenate command in ourlives.
<RunBeepDown> so, great. I'm stuck
<D_man> ^ THIS
<prince-dari> D_man, I was joking about Silver actually getting something right.
<RunBeepDown> ^
<D_man> oh ok so that's not a clue at all?
<D_man> also
<prince-dari> But concatenate is actually a clue.
<RunBeepDown> but concatenate was the clue
<D_man> concatenate - Link (things) together in a chain or series
<RunBeepDown> also: i clued the clue
<D_man> MFW first time i've heard this word. ever.
<ReticentSmolder> if we're talking hex pairs don't you think you might want to bring up an ASCII table? /trollface
<RunBeepDown> yeah, it's like when you bring two strings together and it forms one or some shit
<RunBeepDown> ALSO RETICENT U R NO HALP ;___________;
<prince-dari> INB4 ReticentSmolder gets it in 10 seconds flat
<D_man> rundeepdown - i haven't got a clue
<D_man> inb4 Probably, seeng as he actually has some coding experience ;_;
<ReticentSmolder> already got it dari
<prince-dari> D_man: I'm guessing that's RBD too then? Since I don't see him speaking.
<ReticentSmolder> well, the way to get it
<RunBeepDown> FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<D_man> whats this about loading .swf into mother .swf?
<ReticentSmolder> where's a fucking pen when you need it
<prince-dari> D_man: Wut?
<D_man> so it's not a .swf file within the .swf file?
<D_man> just something i found on google mate
<D_man> i love puzzles
<RainBroDash> 10kk so dari has blocked both my hostnames, brb finding a new proxy ;______; (either that or he's just choosing to 'ignore' what i say, but either way I can't do anything towards this puzzle, so i might aswell get a proxy)
<RainBroDash> 10so brb
<ReticentSmolder> @RainBroDash I solved it
<D_man> WHAT?
<D_man> you solved prince-dari's code?
<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder there's no way i can be expected to solve it anyway
<ReticentSmolder> well yeah, i told you a few lines ago
<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder I don't even know what the fracking word means :P
<ReticentSmolder> really Dari, you could've made the cipher a bit harder
<ReticentSmolder> /trollface
<ReticentSmolder> @trollfacemeter ReticentSmolder
<Steven_Magnet> 6 ReticentSmolder is 27% trollface. (521)
<Nick> its so bad you have to play it if it makes sense
<RainBroDash> 10>says harder. >means harder for a comp sci major
<Nittany_Tiger> Did he use Caesar Cypher?
<prince-dari> I could've, but then it never would hve been solved.
<D_man> wait wait wait
<D_man> reticentsmolder you solved the filewithinafile thing with the 35KB file?
<D_man> RainBroDash - this is impossibru
<RainBroDash> 10D_man not really :P
<RainBroDash> 10just we're out of our league ^^
<Nittany_Tiger> I can solve Caesar Cypher within an hour or few just by trial and error.
<Nittany_Tiger> Very easy coding.
<Nittany_Tiger> Also, thunder.
<D_man> RainBroDash that's always the difference between us, between many people
<D_man> I WILL NEVER ACCEPT DEFEAT!
<prince-dari> MFW I should have used stegnographic encryption for files later on instead of just a simple password.
<RainBroDash> 10well it's just another language
<Nittany_Tiger> Do RSA encryption.
<ReticentSmolder> lol RainBroDash, its ASCII code, any more than that I won't say
<RainBroDash> 10>mfw I write a few sentences in complex french, suddenly dari can't translate it, can't solve my problems. OH LOOK IM MASTER TRICKSTER LOL
<Nittany_Tiger> Aww crap. This storm is a mile to my east.
<Nittany_Tiger> And it's moving south.
<Kosoveon> big rigs over the road racing>>>>ET for the atari 2600
<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder I'm not doing the puzzle anymore :3 since it's made for you comp sci people to solve
<Kosoveon> in sheer comedy value
<D_man> What the hell are you talking about prince?
<D_man> confused
<prince-dari> It's pretty simple to do now. :P
<D_man> no it isn't >_<
<D_man> asc...ii?
<Kosoveon> I'd play it but I don't want the game to crash every two seconds
<Nick> I dunno
<ReticentSmolder> yes? I dunno, gimme a sec, I was pretty sure I had something
<Nick> ET with friends make them play it and its instant lulz
<Nick> for 10 minutes then they're crying
<D_man> So reticentsmolder HASN'T solved it!
<D_man> or you have?
<prince-dari> MFW you need to read all my clues ReticentSmolder.
<ReticentSmolder> yeah I just read the one in the link, I'm now looking through all of them
<D_man> whut is going on. prince-dari do i need knoledge of coding or something for the 2nd half?
<prince-dari> No.
<D_man> oh...
<Kosoveon> well in big rigs you can fall through bridges, pass through your opponent, win every time, scale mountains in seconds, pass through buildings, and go into reverse for infinity
<prince-dari> I've told you how I've done the fileception.
<prince-dari> I've told you where to look too. :P
<D_man> whut
<D_man> conc...
<D_man> concatenate?
<D_man> i've extracted every filething, so .swf .flv and .as in the .swf
<D_man> can't find anything
<prince-dari> Because that's only one half.
<prince-dari> That's not important now.
<D_man> please bear in mind i don't get codin g :P
<prince-dari> You need to find part 2. :P
<D_man> So i ignore the .swf file?
<Kosoveon> I wonder how many catridges of et were actually sold to begin with o-o
<D_man> is it another mediafire link?
<ReticentSmolder> so, is the file actually part of the riddle or was the original list what we're supposed to work with?
<D_man> Reticentsmolder, read whole thread >_<

<ReticentSmolder> okay, I'm a little stuck so here's my theory, the paired numbers are actually hexadecimal placeholders for ASCii code, namely characters and commands in an ASCii table
<D_man> Flutterhi - yup done that
<D_man> or i think i have
<Flutterhi> which ones have you tried?
*Nick freezes Glacymr
<D_man> Reticentsmolder i have no idea what you're talking about i'm afraid
<Ascendant> heya Draelen
*Glacymr isn't frozen
<D_man> flutterhi - most, suggest me some and i'lll tell you if i hav
<ReticentSmolder> the original list, translated into ASCii makes no sense, so I read on and found the file, but I haven't opened it because I don't have winrar and 7zip refuses to
<prince-dari> MFW you're overcomplicating it ReticentSmolder.
<prince-dari> It's pretty simple to be honest. :P
<D_man> reticentsmolder - have you actually read my posts?
<ReticentSmolder> yeah
<D_man> IS PART 2 another link?
<D_man> another file another download?

<ReticentSmolder> ooooooooooooooooooooh, see I'm too used to code junkie stuff
<D_man> lol
<prince-dari> RainBroDash: But do do that.
<prince-dari> You need to find
<D_man> reticentsmolder - think outside every box
<RainBroDash> 10and that is to do with concatenate i guess?
<prince-dari> ...
<RainBroDash> 10also: dari didn't block me
<RainBroDash> 10lol'd
<prince-dari> FILECEPTION
<D_man> prince-dari is the link within the .swf?
<D_man> because:
<prince-dari> YFW I set it to clear in 30 minutes.
<D_man> FUUUUUUUUU
<RainBroDash> 10>mfw dari makes a puzzle that requires comp sci knowledge. "OH LOL U GUISE TAKE SO LONG" yeah because we don't know comp sci
<prince-dari> to do that*
<Kosoveon> intense
<prince-dari> IT's NOTHING TO DO WITH COMPUTERS
<ReticentSmolder> @D_man you said coding experience, I thought you meant you needed an algorithm or something :P
<prince-dari> MY GOD
<D_man> lol
<Flutterhi> well what do you know it is a .swf doc

<Zoroark> D:
<Zoroark> why so?
<D_man> but that's gibberish from hex
<D_man> so uh
<ReticentSmolder> @Prince-dari lame clue is lame, concatenation applies to strings and not int or hex
<D_man> so i join what with what >_<
<D_man> the image with the .swf?
<prince-dari> ReticentSmolder: YFW it doesn't just apply to strings.
<ReticentSmolder> <----------- comp sci major
*Kosoveon can't wait to get back on Brawl agian
<RainBroDash> 10dari btw, concatenate isn't used outside of comp sci. face it
<Kosoveon> *again
<D_man> reticentsmolder then BE CLEVER
<prince-dari> MFW the function is even called concatenate.
<prince-dari> In the program I was using.

<D_man> 'Concatenating files with cat'
<D_man> it isnt' this is it?
<RainBroDash> 10also :trollface: before dari gets genuinely mad
<ReticentSmolder> you can concatenate strings, and you can add integers, but concatenating integers is like 3+4 is 34
<prince-dari> INB4 I ban RBD again.

<ReticentSmolder> yfw those hints suck
<prince-dari> PLEASE?!
<HyperMetalLugia> Odd
<drf|laptop> 03so hm
<RainBroDash> 10would be my guess
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<D_man> >So this is the hint. STFU before I change the hex I put on you
<prince-dari> Well I'm trying not to make it too obvious.
<RainBroDash> 10buuut I'm usually wrong
<prince-dari> But you guys are making it hard.
<drf|laptop> 03what I find hilarious is that Amazon is selling those drives for like $60 more than the official site
<drf|laptop> 03I'm like why
<prince-dari> I just singled out the important words D_man.

<ReticentSmolder> u mad?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> Just disappoint.
<prince-dari> :P
<D_man> dude, prince-dari, whenever I google 'concatenate' or anything like this with 'files' it comes up with a shizton of coding shiz
<ReticentSmolder> yeah I stopped following the conversation awhile ago, I still think you're using the word wrong
<RainBroDash> 10(inb4 dari rage)
<RainBroDash> 10he is :3

<Kosoveon> wb LL
<Nittany_Tiger> And I have pics.
<D_man> and i haven't the foggiest how to 'connect two files'
<prince-dari> I added a file to the end of another file.
<ReticentSmolder> @prince-dari you can add...and you can concatenate, and the difference between them is immense
<prince-dari> Ok? :P
<SilverMane> aisaka
<Light_Latias> 12tys
*Kosoveon sits on Light_Latias
<RainBroDash> 10Nittany_tiger i can has see pics? D:
<D_man> prince-dari I GOT THAT AGES AGO but my coding skills are nonexistent now how do i divided files?
<Kosoveon> :B
*drf|laptop gives Kosoveon a couch
<prince-dari> I concatenated a massive ASCII string to another
<prince-dari> You happy?
<drf|laptop> 03sto psitting on people :|
<prince-dari> Massive ASCII string being a program.
<Kosoveon> I misread as spitting
<Pegacorn> No but seriously,what the hell is happening?Did i walk into a exchange of insuslts with Stone Cold Steve Austin and CM Punk?
<prince-dari> ...
<Manlyguy> You guys mutated Kosovo. You should all be ashamed.
<D_man> so i was on the right track looking through the .swf file?
*Light_Latias 12flat
<prince-dari> File not program.
<RainBroDash> 10dari, you mean you consolidated two ascii strings? you mad?
<ReticentSmolder> @prince-dari string != program

<ReticentSmolder> lol
<Chimera> 04wait what LOL
<prince-dari> I concatenated that ASCII string (one file) to another ASCII string (another file).
<SilverMane> i need to find a girl like Aisaka, who is on the right in this photo http://karmaburn.com/files/anime/toradora/starchildpromo02.jpg
<Nittany_Tiger> String (words) terminology.
<Ascendant> Chimera, PM
<Chimera> 04k o.o
<SilverMane> such a perfect personality for me
<D_man> but the way yo'ure making it sound like prince-dari is that within the .swf there's a string of stuff that is ... important
<prince-dari> There's nothing in the .swf part.
<SilverMane> WHY DON'T YOU EXIST ANIME FANTASY GIRL
<ReticentSmolder> @prince-dari I suggested concatenating the names of the files given, but apparently that wasn't it
<RainBroDash> 10SilverMane I need a girl like this: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JXoJ_CV3m0s/TH8zjNDvY2I/AAAAAAAAABU/wXop-F0ZrBg/s1600/x3-page-halle1_1145055772.jpg
<Pegacorn> *insults

<prince-dari> It's just one half of the file you need, you're finding the other half.
<SilverMane> lol
<Manlyguy> He's now a country, slash Dragonair, slash some other creature.
<prince-dari> In the only other file you have.
<D_man> .. . the .jpg?
<Manlyguy> I'll probably be paid millions of I get a picture of this guy.
<SilverMane> RainBroDash, no kitty for you
<ReticentSmolder> @SilverMane...I've seen that anime, it was good, but I don't think you want a Tsundere
<prince-dari> So go do it D_man.
<prince-dari> :P
<D_man> but i already thought I had
<prince-dari> Did you open it in a hex editor?
<RainBroDash> 10SilverMane... But...
<D_man> a what now? no
<prince-dari> Welp, I said use a hex editor earlier. :P
<Pegacorn> EVERYPONY,YOU MUST SHUT UP OR I WILL STOMP A MUDHOLE IN YER ASSES!
*ReticentSmolder writes fic in which RainBroDash gets a kitty
*RainBroDash 10has no idea what a hex editor is. Because he hasn't done any compsci before in his life :3
<Pegacorn> (lol Stone Cold Steve Austin)
<prince-dari> RainBroDash: You know what?
<prince-dari> Neither have I.
<prince-dari> U mad?
<D_man> mfw there's a billion hex editor programs. which is good

<prince-dari> D_man: Any.
<ReticentSmolder> >realizes hex editing is pointless outside of assembly level
<prince-dari> I use HxD.
<RainBroDash> 10Dari I didn't say learned. All I know about quantum mechanics is self taught.
<SilverMane> ReticentSmolder, a violent, random, controlling, dependant, strong, frail woman is exactly what I need. I enjoy being controlled, while truly being the controller
<RainBroDash> 10I mean you've done it as a hobby dude
<Nittany_Tiger> RainBroDash: http://imageshack.us/f/232/img6071r.jpg/
<D_man> i bet this will be pisseasy now with a hex editor : (

<RainBroDash> 10you still KNOW it, one way or another
<SilverMane> wait what http://imageshack.us/f/833/rule34.jpg/
<ReticentSmolder> @SilverMane, but tsundere aren't controlling, they put up a bold face and let down their barriers slowly to those they like albeit with hesitation
<Pegacorn> Bye everypony,seeya tomorow(i'll be here in the afternoon.)

<D_man> i have opened the .jpg in some inb4virus hex editor program
<ReticentSmolder> >afk eating, bbl
<prince-dari> Now go back through my clues. :P
<SilverMane> but oh dear god did my trainer have the controlling-dependant-submissive down perfectly
<D_man> to find the right line of hex?

<Steven_Magnet> 6 SilverMane is 65% tired. (524)
<Flutterhi> guess not... we find part 2?
<prince-dari> There's a reason I capitalised "find" before. :P
<Kosoveon> does that involve demons and time machines?
<SilverMane> about right
<Kosoveon> if it does I still have the edge
<HyperMetalLugia> http://linewars.patrickaalto.com/LW2.html

<D_man> actually silvermane it was a reply to you :P
<D_man> CTRL F MEDIAFIRE / .com nope
<prince-dari> Because Ctrl-f lurker is exactly right.

<D_man> lol
<D_man> i have no idea
<Flutterhi> yes
<Flutterhi> big differnce
<Flutterhi> there two different file formats

<Flutterhi> erm
<Flutterhi> maybe
<D_man> opened the FILLYCEPTION.gif in some hex editor

<D_man> pic *
<prince-dari> It works before I upload anyway.
<D_man> before isn't the one we see : (
<D_man> so donwload the after and check to see
<Manlyguy> I can't think of anything, either.
<prince-dari> Well, I could just upload the file to a different location.
<prince-dari> :P
<D_man> or that
<Flutterhi> ok I get it now
<D_man> ok u no what i'm gonna stop looking thru the hex lines, and wait for a pic that's confirmed to work, now, prince-dari
<prince-dari> INB4 uploading it somewhere else breaks it too.
<D_man> welp
<D_man> shoulda thought this thru i guess ; (
<D_man> and I was having so much fun...
<Flutterhi> why is that picture all the way at the top
<D_man> which one?
<prince-dari> I'm think it has to be because the image is a GIF or something.
<prince-dari> Which is annoying.
<Flutterhi> yo
<prince-dari> And ponychan breaks it.
<prince-dari> >_>
<Flutterhi> send it to me via email
<D_man> i have many pics flutterhi
<Flutterhi> and I'll post it to my site
<SilverMane> so does anyone want to talk about anything interesting? Personal problems, drug habits, porn, art, anything?
<prince-dari> I'm uploading it to mediafire.
<Flutterhi> the reason ponychan and imgur break it is they they remove associated file data
<Flutterhi> and take ONLY THE IMAGE
<prince-dari> The image stays the same size.
<D_man> My mum's kicked me from her house so i don't know where i'm going to be living, it's why it's all hectic right now with my stuff, Ive never done drugs, porn doesn't turn me on as i find it's so much about personality and not just titties, I love drawing landscape art in pencil, ...Im loving this puzzle

<D_man> or storm form xmen?
*ReticentSmolder RainBroDash (who will be known as RBD for the sake of don't ask why) alighted onto the cloud stoop in front of Rainbow Dash's mansion in the sky. He didn't know what was so urgent, but the letter he received left him more than a little curious.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm wanting to write about weather they /can't/ control.
<RainBroDash> 10oh god now I'm sad because I remembered with a spark
<Nittany_Tiger> Which is possible.

<prince-dari> Ok, I sent it.
<Nittany_Tiger> I actually have the whole story in my head now.
<D_man> prince-dari Bene
<D_man> dat file indeedio
<SilverMane> it's a very sad story; it's one of those stories that really feels humanized, like it could actulaly happen. more of a projection of humanity onto a pony world, rather than a story in pony world with occasional human problems
<RainBroDash> 10RBDxRD?
<SilverMane> With A Spark?
<SoiPony> mfw people keep mentioning that damn fic
<SoiPony> ;_____________________;

*ReticentSmolder RBD wanted to make sure he looked nice, so he had preened his feathers and smoothed out his mane. He never admitted it but he had the biggest crush on the sky blue filly.

<prince-dari> Who said anything about coding? :P
*ReticentSmolder RBD reached a hoof out to ring the bell but couldn't suppress a little nervousness as he waited for a reply.
<prince-dari> You've found the png.
<prince-dari> Just take it otu.
<prince-dari> out*
<D_man> dot dot dot blink blink
<SilverMane> nope, sorry RBD, working on a lot of stories. sorta

<RainBroDash> 10>mfw soi comes to me at my beckoning :3
<SilverMane> i'll read it RBD, but only if you read Storm
*ReticentSmolder Soon, he heard the telltale sound of hoovesteps on clouds and he felt like his chest would burst. Right before he thought his heart was going to jump out of his throat and strangle him, the door swung inwards, revealing Rainbow Dash, apparently just out of the shower and wearing a loose baby blue robe.
<SoiPony> >mfw don't get any funnt ideas sugarcube
<SilverMane> and Soipony, that's so cute! My bitch has a tag-along
<RainBroDash> 10SilverMane what is storm?

*ReticentSmolder "S-sure thing Rainbow Dash," RBD stammered, "I think I'll just sit in your living room for a bit till you're ready."
<Dashite> DAMMIT RBD! MAN UP ALREADY AND STOP STUTTERING!

<prince-dari> ‰PNG........IHDR...{...h....
<prince-dari> There, onwards.
<prince-dari> :P
<FlutterHi2> but it worked?
*ReticentSmolder RBD trotted inside, Rainbow Dash closing the door behind him. For a minute he thought about taking her up on that offer for food, but realized that it probably would be best if he kept a level head for whatever she had in store. Whatever it was, she wasn't going to tell him up front.

<RainBroDash> 10"<Ghosties>: DO HO HO"
*ReticentSmolder RBD couldn't stifle the urge to peek at Dash's robe as she walked up the flight of stairs. His wings began to twitch as her bare rump came into view just before disappearing down a corridor.

<Asterisk> !sneas
*Sneas now belongs to Asterisk for 12 minutes
<D_man> ok pricne-dari wat do with pic?

<prince-dari> D_man
<FlutterHi2> did you get the png?
*ReticentSmolder A blush passed across his features as he realized he had been staring. 'I hope she didn't see that,' he thought idly as he walked forward into the kitchen.
<SilverMane> you do good work, ReticentSmolder.
<prince-dari> RED GOGGLES
<Dashite> inb4 she totally saw that.

<FlutterHi2> filter out the red in the picture?
<FlutterHi2> or perhaps
<RainBroDash> 10Also: not true. but funny
*ReticentSmolder RBD had never been inside her castle of clouds, but the layout had been pretty obvious from the outside. Through the kitchen was an opening that led into the living room. It appeared well stocked with food, albeit a little dirty from the tomboy's lack of oversight.
<FlutterHi2> filter only the red
<D_man> mfw i can't code let alone image edit stuff
<FlutterHi2> should I boot up PS
<D_man> I have not got PS
<FlutterHi2> image diting is way easier then coding

*SilverMane has ps3
<prince-dari> GTFO, you're supposed to be burning alive.
<FlutterHi2> PS: No one cares ;)
<prince-dari> :)
<SoiPony> lol
*ReticentSmolder Passing by the counter tops and fridge, RBD made his way into the living room. It was cozy and had a large window showing a wide panorama of Ponyville in the dying sunlight below them.
<RainBroDash> 10dari: mfw I didn't check the skype till after you said that
<RainBroDash> 10>mfw I'm immune to fire
<FlutterHi2> dari should I be filtering?
<prince-dari> Mebbe.
<Manlyguy> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Manlyguy, you are a 4Furret.
<FlutterHi2> k
*ReticentSmolder He could hear Dash's hooves scuffle around upstairs. It sounded like she was moving fairly quickly, thought that shouldn't be a surprise, but he thought he heard her practically tripping over her own hooves.
<D_man> i don't know how to filter anything >_<
<RainBroDash> 10>mfw you need to xray the picture and see what kind of underwear the goggles are wearing
<prince-dari> >goggles
<prince-dari> >underwear
<prince-dari> Wut
<RainBroDash> 10It's the only thing I can almost do on photoshop...
<D_man> prince-dari is the image of the goggles impoartant? or just the 'red goggles' clue?
<prince-dari> Just red goggles.
*ReticentSmolder The living room was lightly furnished, all of the pieces being made of clouds. He decided to sit on the sofa lying in the center of the room facing the window.
<Espeon> 06Good night
<SilverMane> i can read goggles just fine. gawsh
<RainBroDash> 10....
<Kosoveon> night
<Kosoveon> hi sheena

<SilverSonic> !sneas
*Sneas still belongs to Asterisk for 5 more minutes
<SilverSonic> ;p
<prince-dari> Unless you actually happen to have some red goggles lying around.
*ReticentSmolder Nervous and apprehensive, RBD's mind began to race at the possibilities of what Dash could want at this hour. Was it a surprise? A party? Did she want to confess her deep-seated desire for him even thought they had barely met just a week ago and he didn't want to come off as too forward and oh my gosh what am I doing here I shou-
<SilverSonic> nini Xeli :3
<prince-dari> Or a red gel.
<SheenaFox> oh

<RainBroDash> 10>GET OUT OF MY HEAD
<SheenaFox> hi NightSeas
<prince-dari> Really, that's not a nice place to be anyway ReticentSmolder.
*ReticentSmolder His thoughts were cut off by the sound of hoofsteps on the stairs behind him. She was coming downstairs! RBD tried his hardest not to panic, but couldn't shake the feeling welling up in his stomach.
<SilverMane> he's good at this, first he's writing how i act, moderately, then how you think
<ReticentSmolder> you are an open book RainBroDash :P
<SilverSonic> Hiya SheenaFox
<D_man> lol
<SheenaFox> hi SilverSonic
<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder i expected nothing less

<prince-dari> Sing.
<prince-dari> Nao
<SilverMane> anyone want to surgically give me full-sized wings that function properly? I'll trade you the SilverMane fortune for them
<FlutterHi2> I'm on the right track
<FlutterHi2> theres a hidden word at the top
<FlutterHi2> working on it
*ReticentSmolder RBD decided it would be best not to look, let Dash do whatever she had planned and get this over with so the beating in his chest would stop reminding him of exactly how much adrenaline was pumping through his veins.
<SilverMane> jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the OH GOD IT'S IN MY EYES! WHY!
<D_man> gah ok i get it i have to use a red filter! but i don't know how to on keyboard and have nothing red / seethrough here on me!

*SilverMane kicks prince-dari. It's not very effective
<SilverMane> Wait, prince-dari, that means he can't record the story if reticentsmolder writes while he is gone
<prince-dari> I'll make him sing...Eventually.
<prince-dari> I just need leverage.
<SilverMane> which means we all have to wait for him to get back to see more shipping
<prince-dari> Dealwithit. :P
<SoiPony> dari
<D_man> How I filter red!
*SilverMane hopes he doesn't become leverage. or gold bars. Nor pizza cake
<Ziltoid> WHats going on here?
<SoiPony> you bitch
<D_man> I get it it's the next thing but i odn't know how i do this
<SilverSonic> !sneas
*Sneas now belongs to SilverSonic for 5 minutes

<SoiPony> making me wait for shipping...?
<ReticentSmolder> yeah I'm waiting till the eventual drama passes before posting what I just wrote
<prince-dari> D_man: Well I know you can with photoshop.
<Dashite> PIZZA CAKE
<ClockworkPie> Problem Soi?
<prince-dari> I dunno what else can though.
<prince-dari> GIMP maybe?
<prince-dari> That's free too.
<SoiPony> indeed, CP
<SilverMane> go read 'Out in the Cold' or 'Kindness's Reward' if you need shipping, Soipony. very good stuff
<SoiPony> lol
<ReticentSmolder> Kindness's Reward...awesome stuff there
<SoiPony> very well
<SilverMane> seriously, Out in the Cold made me a twixie #1 fan, and Kindness's Reward pushed it into #2, and made Trixshy best ship
<Ziltoid> I need to read that rbd x cloud fic
<D_man> prince-dari i actually have gimp...never used it, but i'll try my hand
<SilverMane> NO YOU DON'T

<FlutterHi2> but I found it
<Ziltoid> rarity isnt worst pony
<D_man> >dari you cock. areyoubritish.jpg
<SilverMane> RainBroDash, but she's gonna teach Twilight about her feelings, because ButterScotch Sundae wrote about their magic book
<ReticentSmolder> @RainBroDash admit rarity is pretty awesome and I'll post the parts of the fic you missed :P
<prince-dari> MFW Reticent has leverage.
<SilverMane> DO IT
<prince-dari> GOD DAMN IT
<RainBroDash> 10SilverMane. That magic book fic.
<RainBroDash> 10DARI U MAD
<prince-dari> WHERE'S MY LEVERAGE?
<prince-dari> I'll get leverage.
<SilverMane> RainBroDash, it was amazing, right?
<prince-dari> One day.
*SilverMane holds out his arm.
<FlutterHi2> So I was right about filtering
*RainBroDash 10ITT: Dari wants leverage to make me sing. He has absolutely diddly squat.
*RainBroDash 10has been singing for about 30 minutes. just with his mic off.
<SilverMane> i printed off With a Spark
<prince-dari> ain'tevenmad
<SilverMane> MORE STORY TiME
<SoiPony> YAY
*ReticentSmolder Dash broke the silence first,"Well, I'm back...are you going to turn around or what?" RBD's head spun around so fast it almost threw him off the couch, and what he saw made his jaw drop and his pupils dilate to pinprick proportions.
<prince-dari> MFW I decide the fic is too suggestive for our nice, family friendly chat room
<prince-dari> MFW leverage

<ReticentSmolder> @prince-dari if you're worried I can take it into a pm
<prince-dari> Nah, no leverage gained.
<RainBroDash> 10reticent he just wants leverage over me
*ReticentSmolder owns RainBroDash's balls for now
<SilverMane> RainBroDash, you have been hiding in my own shipping channel?
<SilverMane> ReticentSmolder, they are on loan.

<Ziltoid> What is this shipping that you speak of?

<D_man> also, stop being a mean mean meanie pants to RainBroDash
<prince-dari> Or an instruction.
<prince-dari> Welp, pony time.
<D_man> just look at the time

<D_man> welp, pony time is 57 65 6c 70 2c 20 70 6f 6e 79 20 74 69 6d 65
<D_man> Y u being mean to RBD?
<FlutterHi2> nah
<prince-dari> I told you.
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> You could take my sentence to be it is pony time.
<D_man> RBD why don't you want to sing?
<prince-dari> [03:27] <prince-dari> Or an instruction.
<prince-dari> Go and pony: Time.
<D_man> it is pony time gives: 69 74 20 69 73 20 70 6f 6e 79 20 74 69 6d 65 0d 0a
<D_man> unless
<FlutterHi2> those numbers determine pony time
<FlutterHi2> ?
<FlutterHi2> 23-5-12-16 16-15-14-25 20-9-13-5 20-8-5-14 2-9-18-4 10-21-19-20 3-1-13-5 2-1-3-11 9-14-20-15 16-12-1-25 2-18-1
<D_man> 9-20 9-19 16-15-14-25 20-9-13-5 is 'it is pony time'
<FlutterHi2> wrong it is silly
<prince-dari> The wording doesn't matter.
<prince-dari> I just reworded it above.
<prince-dari> :P
<FlutterHi2> the total number?
<prince-dari> You're missing the pretty crucial point.
<D_man> 'it is pony time' is 09 20 09 19 16 15 14 25 20 09 13 05 which in hex is '	 	'
<prince-dari> No more hex.
<prince-dari> Remember?
<D_man> bird is 33 :P
<D_man> pony. 16-15-14-25.
<prince-dari> [03:23] <prince-dari> "B(2) + I(9) + R(18) + D(4) = 33"

<RainBroDash> 10prince-dari's face when it literally makes no difference, except makes me easier to see
<prince-dari> You have to close down the clock.
<prince-dari> Change your time.
<prince-dari> And reopen it.
<prince-dari> :P
<D_man> aka f5 on chrome
<FlutterHi2> what
<FlutterHi2> why
<FlutterHi2> thats silly

<FlutterHi2> no... your comp time
<D_man> I changed my comp time
<FlutterHi2> mmmm
<D_man> and refreshed teh chorome window with the clock open

<FlutterHi> hello
<Nittany_Tiger> A moderation storm?
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<FlutterHi> how do i this clock
<FlutterHi> I just decompiled it with trillix
<FlutterHi> and looking at your code has helped me very little
<D_man> flutterhi wnat clues :3
<Sneas> 03cr\g
<FlutterHi> yes
<Manlyguy> There is a disturbing lack of violence and explosions in here. ):
<FlutterHi> didn't help
<FlutterHi> not at all
<D_man> um
<D_man> ok what have you got open right now?
<FlutterHi> the source code
<FlutterHi> and the .swf clock
<D_man> hmm
<D_man> all you need is the .swf clock open
<D_man> no source code
<D_man> and remembering that 'pony' is 16 15 14 25
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<D_man> remember that the clock is your internal pc clock
<D_man> so you can edit that
<D_man> 16 15 14 25
<D_man> Date hour minute second (i'd recommend you set the 'seconds' to a little before, like 15 or so, to give you 10 seconds to refresh / reopen the .swf and prepare for teh lulz)
<Light_Latias> 12there is a disturbing lack
<D_man> So prince-dari how is it not over aside from
<D_man> Konami code?

<prince-dari> So does it just ask a question every period of time, or when people ask it to ask a question.
<Dman> It asks a q and once its answered itll ask another randomly
<Dman> when a mod asks it to
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<Dman> and when it's answered it'll ask another, so not periodically but once answered.

<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aurora03)02WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
<Nittany_Tiger> Is EA trying to slip Always-On DRM on me?
<Kosoveon> hi rora
<drf|laptop> 03god, why is buying candy in bulk so expensive
<Dashite> What game?
<Aurora> how bulk
<Aurora> and how expensive
<drf|laptop> 03we're trying to get dark blue and yellow candy, either jelly beans or M&M's
<Nittany_Tiger> Medal of Honor.
<drf|laptop> 03like 10 pounds
<Dman> mfw you couldn't jump in mirrors edge unless you're on teh interwebs
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Aurora> 6...LOL
<Aurora> 6wow
<Aurora> 6thats a lot
<drf|laptop> 03my sister's having a graduation party
<Dashite> MFW dman is wrong.
<drf|laptop> 03and we wanted to do school colors
<Nittany_Tiger> I want to play Tier One mode just to kill boredom.
<drf|laptop> 03which are blue and yellow
<Dman> dashite i heard somethign like this
<Dman> i don't have it thou so ok i'll believe you
<drf|laptop> 03cheapest I found was to get blueberry and lemon Jelly Belly, it's like $35 for 5 pounds of each color
<Aurora> 6ew
<drf|laptop> 03$70 for 10 pounds in other words
<Aurora> 6sounds like Gilroy High
<Nittany_Tiger> BTW: Ubisoft is bringing Always-On DRM back.
<Aurora> 6which was my rival high school
<drf|laptop> 03but M&Ms made more sense to me
<drf|laptop> 03since they're all just chocolat8e
<drf|laptop> 03rather than conflicting flavors
<drf|laptop> 03but those are like OBNOXIOUSLY expensive
<Aurora> 6personalized M&Ms
<drf|laptop> 03like $45 for 5lbs
<Aurora> 6:D
<drf|laptop> 03OK those
<drf|laptop> 03cost $160 to get 10 pounds
<drf|laptop> 03I actually checked
<Aurora> 6wow
<Aurora> 6nvm then
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03I mean
<drf|laptop> 0310 pounds of candy may sound like a lot
<Dashite> I only have my Steam version installed right now so I can't double check for you, but i'm 95% sure you don't need to be online.
<Kyu> 07lol
<drf|laptop> 03but when you're having a party with 50+ people
<drf|laptop> 03that's actually not that much, right?
<Dashite> And Ubisoft considers it's DRM a success.
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't have to be online to play SP.
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Kyu> 07my sister got personalized Jones soda for her 18th bday =P
<Kyu> 07now THAT was expensive
<drf|laptop> 03I might see about going to this Eastern Market place in Detroit
<Nittany_Tiger> Ubisoft's DRM is successful in lowering their sales.
<Aurora> 6how do you personalize soda
<drf|laptop> 03I went there with my cooking class in high school
<FlutterHi2> back, Ima crash at 1
<drf|laptop> 03and they had the most awesome candy store with really cheap prices
<Kyu> 07her picture on the label
<drf|laptop> 03That's awesome
<Aurora> 6lol
<drf|laptop> 03how much did it cost though
<Aurora> 6that's weird
<FlutterHi2> I think i might go becom flutterHigh
<drf|laptop> 03Jones is pretty pricy
<drf|laptop> 03*pricey w/e
<FlutterHi2> and then watch ponies
<RDash> Dman Wait, do you need to make an account, if not then I guess mine is RDash ;)
<Kyu> 07$4 a bottle if I remember correctly
<drf|laptop> 03yeah that's rediculous LOL
<FlutterHi2> what are we playing?
<Nittany_Tiger> http://forums.filefront.com/general-gaming/438740-ubisoft-returns-using-always-drm.html <- My reaction when I found out Ubi was bringing Always-On DRM back.
<drf|laptop> 03even like the $1.75 or something a bottle that my school charged was a lot
<drf|laptop> 03well that was just generic obviously :P
<drf|laptop> 03you know what I love? Faygo. Local Detroit brand, you can get 24oz for $1
<drf|laptop> 03and they have redpop which is like THE MOST AMAZING FLAVOR OF SODA EVER

<drf|laptop> 03yep
<drf|laptop> 03they were talking about their first cars
<drf|laptop> 03and racing them and stuff LOL
<Nittany_Tiger> If the game is going to be made after Driver: SF, it'll likely be in the game.
<Kyu> 07and nvm, it was $3 a bottle
<drf|laptop> 03LOL @ the name Volkswagen Thing
<Dashite> When is driver?
<Nittany_Tiger> Modern game publishers make me want to explode. They make me want to revolt.
<Kyu> 07with 5% off cuz we got about 100 bottles XD
<drf|laptop> 03that was Rick from Pawn Star's first vehicle
<FlutterHi2> psht the reason I still play unreal tourney :P
<drf|laptop> 03Holy crap, that's a lot of money to spend on soda o_o
<Dman> RDash you don't need an account
<Kyu> 07iknorite
<Dashite> I wonder if people still play C&C Renegade...
<drf|laptop> 03and I thought I was crazy for spending aboutg $50 to stock my fridge in college

<Chimera> 04*)
<Denied_Existence> Anyway, I am trying to help him out, but he certainly isn't the most organized. Right now he's trying to get the logs of panel members from the past episodes.

<Denied_Existence> Where did THAT line come from?
<Denied_Existence> Reticent
<mib_276gfn> it came from a whisper from the wind
<mib_276gfn> ofc
<Dashite> Wut? SUDDENLY WINGBONERS?
<Chimera> 04HML could you kindly tell me how to do that? :P
<Chimera> 04Anyway how is the geometry so far :V

<FlutterHi2> jesus this T-shirt is huge
<Chimera> 04not a bad idea actually XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Ask someone else, it might be possble
<FlutterHi2> I guess it'll shrink in the wash
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean, try a wirefram
<Chimera> 043d ripper DX only works for 3DS max though as I recall
<HyperMetalLugia> *wireframe
<Chimera> 04And I hate it's interface sooo much
<Chimera> 04huh
<FlutterHi2> also where did wingboners come from
<Dashite> No idea.
<FlutterHi2> THEY're fucking retarded
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, make a copy of the geometry using a screenshot?
<Denied_Existence> I know
<Denied_Existence> Let me get my notes
<Denied_Existence> (Sorry, sociology calls for lots of notes)
<HyperMetalLugia> And figure out a way to perfectly put it in the 3D designer program? XD

<RDash> @wingbonermeter Steven has
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Steven has is 40% wingboner. (527)
<RDash> That explains it
<Rainbow_Dash> D_E you realize that if it's right about wing boners, it's probably right about your notes too.
<FlutterHi2> @retardedmeter wingboners
<Steven_Magnet> 6 wingboners is 31% retarded. (528)
<Lightning> where are you at then repad
<Haseo> everywhere.
<Dman> @awesome A wingboner
<Lightning> ohai
<Dman> @awesomemeter A wingboner
<Steven_Magnet> 6 A wingboner is 53% awesome. (529)

<Haseo> I have gained the ability to summon you now.
<FlutterHi2> damnit
<Haseo> It only cost me $150
<Lightning> pffff

<FlutterHi2> @NotAwesomemeter A wingboner

<RDash> @pony This pony has a wingboner from this chat:
<Steven_Magnet> 6 This pony has a wingboner from this chat: is 7Scoota6loo
<Denied_Existence> Ok...i managed to find something: Dubtrot apparently caught on much like the non-pony dubstep. So taking this into account, I can estimate that 70%-90% of the internet enjoyed porn
<FlutterHi2> HA
<Denied_Existence> Based upon this:
<Haseo> NOW
<Rainbow_Dash> Uh... really did not need to know that Scootaloo has a wing boner...
<RDash> ^haha
<FlutterHi2> hahaha
<Asterisk> I started walking earlier
<Denied_Existence> We can also assume that dubstep is present on 1%-20% of the internet
<Asterisk> I'll be home sometime tomorrow
<FlutterHi2> !pony
<FlutterHi2> lol
<Haseo> And you're fucking lying
<RDash> Scoots, you dawg
<RDash> What the heck is dubtrot?
<Asterisk> So what.
<Dashite> Dubstep
<Asterisk> I'll be home around 4-5
<FlutterHi2> @clopmeter scootaloo
<Steven_Magnet> 6 scootaloo is 49% clop. (531)
<Denied_Existence> So therefore these numbers can translate into the fandom with 60%-75% for porn and 5%-21% for trotstep
<FlutterHi2> ohh shit
<Asterisk> Shut your mouth.
<RDash> To google!
<Rainbow_Dash> No, just no! Stop that!
<Denied_Existence> Although I estimate that the porn percentage is much lower than those calculations
<FlutterHi2> trotstep is the shit yo
<Sneas> 03rape
<Denied_Existence> Keep in mind these aren't competing percentages
<FlutterHi2> @shitmeter trotstep
<Steven_Magnet> 6 trotstep is 9% shit. (532)
<FlutterHi2> @theshitmeter trotstep
<Steven_Magnet> 6 trotstep is 91% theshit. (533)
<FlutterHi2> HAHa
<Denied_Existence> Wow
<Dashite> 100%
<FlutterHi2> totally accounted for O_o
<RDash> The notes have spoken!
<FlutterHi2> lol
<FlutterHi2> so when is mane 6 coming out anypony know?
<Denied_Existence> Also keep in mind my percentages are rough estimates and are based upon my(and a few other's) observations.
<Denied_Existence> no clue
<ReticentSmolder> hey prince-dari, what's your stance on clopfic?
<Dashite> When it's done.
<prince-dari> Don't have a problem with people who like them, but I don't like them myself.
<prince-dari> Though the BMN shipping fics are just funny.
<FlutterHi2> wwingboners ruined clopfics for me
<ReticentSmolder> hehehe...you should know about the BMN ship fic I just made
<Denied_Existence> TO THE NOTES
<mib_276gfn> heheheehehehehehe
<RDash> FlutterHi2 You really hate wingboners XD
<ReticentSmolder> *pomf*

<drf|laptop> 03what pisses me off is that 4G is basically an excuse for companies to not upgrade their 3G
<Dashite> lol, complete with pie
<drf|laptop> 03I know that in Europe, for example, people have 3G phones with like 12mbps and more
<drf|laptop> 03and that's about what you get with '4G" here

<FlutterHi> lol
<Dashite> I run through one of BG1 or BG2 at least once a year.

<FlutterHi> yeah some of its like that
<DeniedExistence> Wo bist er?
<Dashite> This most recent run was because I saw someone else attempt insane scs so I wanted to see if I could pull it off.

<DeniedExistence> SCS stands for?
<RainBroDash> 10ignore the first 13 sec :3
<Dashite> Sword Coast Strategems.
<Dashite> It's an AI mod that makes all the enemies act more intelligently.
<DeniedExistence> Yeah, I figured
*Freyskol is having fun with an emualtor
<Freyskol> emulator
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Dashite> They will use their abilities better, drink potions, make better spell selections, call for help and so on.
<FlutterHi> BLOOOWWWWWWNNNNNNNN AWWWWAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY
<Dashite> The Bandit Camp in chapter 4 is a nightmare if you aren't ready for it.
<RainBroDash> 10FlutterHi :3
<DeniedExistence> MAGIC MISSILE THEM TILL THEY ARE FUCKING DEAD
<DeniedExistence> RRRRAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHH
<Dashite> In the normal game you can cheese the fog of war to only draw in a few enemies at a time.
<Dashite> With SCS, if anyone goes hostile, the entire map goes hostile.

<Absol> what kind of emulator
<Dashite> There are around 40ish bandits on the map, half of which are elite troops.
<Freyskol> playstation~
<Freyskol> some old games like nuclear strike, starsweep, command and conquer
<Dashite> If you start a fight before going after the boss tent, the boss characters will actually leave the tent area and come hunt you down along with everyone else.
<DeniedExistence> EAT SOME FACES, THEY ARE ECCEEDINGLY NUTRITIOUS

<Draelen> thats wierd ;p
<Armageddon> yeah
<Dusky> Fixed?
<Armageddon> The binding shouldn't be an issue
<Armageddon> And it would have tried linking and then spat out errors rather than timing out
<Draelen> 72.20.16.202 is apparently not properly sending/receiving traffic
<Barry> yeah
<Ascendant> Ah o_O
<Ascendant> And yes, Dusky
<Draelen> told ocean to use 72.20.16.201 when binding to island, that seemed to sort it right away
<Dusky> Great
<Ascendant> Strange
<Ascendant> So do I need to change my link block?
<Draelen> not really, worked anyway ;p
<Draelen> once I get fibre from my ISP, I'll be decomissioning the server ocean is on, their network reliability is pretty poor ;p
<Draelen> it's unfortunate it's not as stable as their datacenters power, I had 3.3 years uptime at one point ;p
<Draelen> before a mysterious reboot
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> The 1000 day uptime? xD
<Draelen> indeed ;p
<Ascendant> I remember that
<Draelen> I've a nice little NAS box here, 2.84ghz q9550 quadcore, 8GB ram, 4TB zfs array, and it's a heck of a lot more stable from my ADSL2 line than staminus is
<Ascendant> Nice o.O
<Dusky> Gotta bbl
<Dusky> Passing through water vaul from sea to lake
<Ascendant> Seeya
<Ascendant> heh
<Ascendant> one of my friend's VPSes
<Ascendant> $17 per month, photonvps, xen server, has 8 cores
<Draelen> nice ;p
<Draelen> that's not bad at all
<Ascendant> so far I like linode and leaseweb
<Ascendant> more linode though
<Ascendant> nightshadow@legendary:~$ uptime
<Ascendant> 15:24:24 up 70 days, 55 min, 1 user, load average: 0.12, 0.07, 0.06
<Ascendant> that's my leaseweb server
<Ascendant> hasn't gone down since it was bought
<Draelen> linode are pretty well respected, indeed
<Ascendant> linode has awesome support
<Ascendant> sadly they have that IP policy now >:
<Ascendant> can't get extra IPs without a valid reason
<Draelen> likely because of ipv4 address exaustion ;p
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Draelen> my ISP is great for that, I have 8 statuc from them ;p
<Draelen> statics*
<Ascendant> o_O
<Ascendant> lucky D:
<Ascendant> IPv6 is easy to get atm
<Ascendant> You have to tunnel it most of the time, though, and he.net's fremont datacenter sucks lol
<Draelen> indeedy, there's no shortage either
<Ascendant> yeah
<Draelen> I think I still have two /64's and a /48 from he.net
<Ascendant> I have a few
<Ascendant> and some providers give free IPv6 IPs
<Ascendant> I know vps247 give every customer a free /64 block
<Ascendant> their uptime has been pretty bad though, although their network speed is decent
<Draelen> what I'll do with 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 + 36,893,488,147,419,103,232 IPv6 addresses I've yet to figure out
<Ascendant> I don't know either
<Ascendant> people will need to learn how to ban ranges now :p
<Draelen> IPv6 will make that interesting, indeed ;p
<Ascendant> or there's be mass murdering in regards to ban evasion
<Ascendant> there'll*
<Ascendant> yeah
<Draelen> IPv6 is starting to remind me of the way IPv4 went when it was first incepted
<Ascendant> and when bots start to use it...
<Ascendant> Heh?
<Ascendant> Wasn't there :p
<Draelen> they handed out whole /8's to big corporations like candy at the beginning
<Draelen> then there was much scrambling over trying to claw/reclaim/buy them back
<Draelen> when address space started becomming scarce
<Ascendant> lol /8s? that's insane
<Ascendant> class C block of IPs
<Ascendant> or something
<Ascendant> But heh, atm I'm like "grab the IPv6 while you can!"
<Draelen> indeed, that's usually the best, have a small block and expand when you need it
<Ascendant> I have quite a lot of blocks atm
<Ascendant> was gonna put an IPv6 IP on island but universehosting is retarded and hasn't responded to my request for the free IPv6 IP they say they provide
<Ascendant> and I'm not even sure what the biggest block of IPv6 is atm
<Draelen> pity, the ircd sometimes needs a little coaxing in regards to the config file when adding it, and needs to be compiled with ipv6 support
<Ascendant> is it /24 or something? or still /8?
<Ascendant> And yeah
<Ascendant> it needs listen [ipv6IP]:port;
<Draelen> newer versions support things like [ipv6], but older are silly and request you puy all IPv4's in the form of ::ffff:<ipv4> or something similar
<Draelen> put*
<Ascendant> oh god
<Ascendant> that's what it looks like when linking
<Draelen> it's pretty annoying
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Ascendant> I hate compiling with IPv6 support as well
<Ascendant> Because it makes the link notices look like piles of unreadable crap
<Ascendant> like anope's databases
<Ascendant> okay, not that bad, but hopefully you get the gist
<Draelen> very much so, and poor you if you have scripts that have to parse it *coughs*
<Ascendant> and yeah, that too x.x
<Draelen> need to dash sadly, I've got a bit of packing to do, leaving the country tomorrow for norway ;p
<Ascendant> Ah, seeya :p
<Ascendant> I need to sleep now anyway
<Draelen> I'll still be online semi-regurlarly while away incase anything explodes
<Ascendant> Ah, well, have fun etc.
<Ascendant> My school still dislikes me connecting elsewhere so getting on via SSH at school is impossible, though I'll be on IRC using CGI:IRC
<Draelen> Thanks, and sleep well ;p

<Barry> that should be easy enough to do, since they both hail from Canterlot
*Shiny-Growlithe doesn't have any money either
<RDash> Yep
<RDash> It couldve been worse
<Barry> I'll get started on it on my next turn, since this one is almost up
<RDash> Steven Magnet X Apple Bloom
<Barry> lol
<Dman> Hey Barry! Hi RDash!
<RDash> Well, pretty much anypony with steven
<RDash> Hi Dman!
<Barry> Hi DMan
<Dman> 0_o
<RDash> haha
<Dman> anypony with steven what? :P
<Dman> @pony Steven Magnet's waifu
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Steven Magnet's waifu is 14Hoity-15Toity
<Dman> 0_________________0
<RDash> A shipfic XD
<Dman> I see
<Barry> I consulted Steven about who I would write a shipfic of and who I would pair the pony with. I got Hoity/Twilight
<Ray> 02Soo... do you have a full Steam acount, or just the limited one? .-.
<Dman> Lol, that's a new ship
<Barry> I'll post it here when it's done
<Dman> Are you still doing the WW one?
<Barry> Yeah, but I'm at an impasse right now
<Barry> I'll go ahead and transfer what I have to a Google Doc and let you look it over, k?
<Espeon> 06Steam rating I'm not sure, I think it depends on how many different games you play recently or something
<Dman> If ya want, yea, I can do a sort of mini review
<Barry> They haven't gotten to Hyrule, yet, though
<Barry> Just one question... Can a water spout actually slice someone to ribbons?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Ah I see
<Espeon> 06Well Shiny does have terraria so I guess he has the full one
<Espeon> 06he could add me as a friend too, so yeah
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Guess so XD
<Dman> Don't they get to Hyrule after like ages of sailing and adventuring aniways?
<Dman> Actually -
<Barry> I could do it that way.
<Dman> It's an industrial process to cut very thick metal into shapes using a water spout
<Barry> ah
<Dman> But this involves Indian Sand, very very tough fine sand.
<Dman> So yes it can, but normally cuz of other things in the water :P
<Dman> I've seen it mahself - one LOUD process
<Barry> so a naturally occurring water spout in the middle of the ocean can't?
<Dman> but it cuts to like 1/100th of a mm or something ridiculous, and is uberthin =]
<Dman> Uhhhmmmm
<Dman> That i don't know
<Barry> hm
<Dman> but i don't think so ... ? it's water
<Dman> hmm
<Dman> Does someone get chopped up or something?
<Barry> I was planning on having them get caught in a freak storm on their way and being tossed by a tornado, like how Cyclos does to Link if you take too lonjg with him.
<Barry> long*
<RDash> Ah, off to the eye docter. Seeya later everypony
<Barry> K
<Dman> But ... does a pony get sliced to bits?
<Dman> Well, see ya in a bit RDash
<Barry> I haven't aqctually written that part, yet
<Barry> actually*
<Barry> I was asking if it was possible so I'd know whether or not to use it
<Barry> but it would just be a sailor
<Dman> Oh ok
<Barry> none of the main characters will be hurt that way
<Dman> I Don't think so myself but it's not something I know about
<Barry> I did give AJ seasickness, though
<Dman> >mfw typing 'can waterspout' and google suggests 'kill you'
<Dman> Lol! sounds about rite!
<Barry> lol
<Dman> Eyup
<Dman> water can't slice through anything
<Dman> just rip/tear
<Dman> you need glass/sand/other stuff within it
<Dman> So...the sailor could be blown into the sea and drown? eyedunno
<HuffytheMagicDragon> wazzap
<Dman> WAZAAAAAAAAAA huffythemagicdragon
<HuffytheMagicDragon> Zaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Dman> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

<HuffytheMagicDragon> dat it?
<Dman> i guess
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i got two things to shar w/ u gaiz already for this friday
<Dman> Oh?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> yo wanna hear the 1st 1?
<Dman> and the second second, yes
<HuffytheMagicDragon> K i'm gunna ask everyone what they think would happen if the mane six played silent library
*Espeon floofs
<{Skyedevil}> Look what this true heart of a human said: I have a form of Autism called Asperger's Syndrome .For years I kept my diagnosis in the closet,for fear of being ostracised or misunderstood by the people around me.Now as an adult,I'm learning that Autism doesn't have to define who I am,but is only one part of who I am.
<{Skyedevil}> There will always be people out there who want to so call ''cure'' us, but how would they like it if we wanted to cure them because they're not like us?They probally wouldn't like it one bit.Thought the whole ''cure autism'' thing to me is a touchy subject and organisation like Autism Speaks only create bad stereotype about people on the spectrum.If they really want to help,they should...
<{Skyedevil}> ...advocate for us,rather than spew hateful propoganda.
<Dman> What's silent library?
<{Skyedevil}> So bloody true.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> never seen it? its on Mtv2
<HuffytheMagicDragon> funny as hell'
<Dman> So you're gonna ask everyone about it? why not write a fic?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> cuz i'm busy
*Shiny-Growlithe fluufs
<HuffytheMagicDragon> the second is gonna be the origin of bronyism in canada
<HuffytheMagicDragon> thats all
<Dman> ok
<HuffytheMagicDragon> BAI
<Dman> so you're gonna ask everyone stuff on friday?
*Espeon sprawls on Shiny =w=
*Shiny-Growlithe sprawls out under Espeon
<Barry> what did I miss?
