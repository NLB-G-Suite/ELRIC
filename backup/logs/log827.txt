<Barbetos> I should start putting it as the A movie I guess.
<butler> chatting on a saturday
<thelonecubone|GoW3> welcome back Dark92Enigma :)
<Wither> Oh a Pony/Brony Joined ^,.....,^
<Barbetos> Seems like an A.
<AdamTheDuck> Barbetos, yes
<AdamTheDuck> Barbetos, so much yes
<AdamTheDuck> My next A-movie choice.
<Barbetos> Same here
<Barbetos> Gona just jot that down.
<Barbetos> Pencil it in.
<Barbetos> And just btw, Just Cuase 2 is too fun for its own good.
<Kammerjunk> It really is quite fun.
<thelonecubone|GoW3> I should of Bought that game when i had the chance ;_:
<Kammerjunk> Oh awesome, Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter is well above the six month encore limit.
<thelonecubone|GoW3> I never seen that movie, Is it good?
<Kammerjunk> It is the best.
<Kammerjunk> The absolute best.
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Ah
<butler> is it both good and bad what movie writers are doing to classic fairy tales?
<Kammerjunk> I mean, look at the title. It's about Jesus Christ who hunts vampires.
<AdamTheDuck> thelonecubone|GoW3, you have a Steam account?
<thelonecubone|GoW3> well, I hope it gets pick Next lotto
<thelonecubone|GoW3> No
<thelonecubone|GoW3> ;_;
<Dark92Enigma> Kammerjunk: THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD
<thelonecubone|GoW3> and even if i had one, My computer needs some stuff to be able to play games
<Kammerjunk> Abe Lincoln go home, I'd rather watch Jesus Christ hunt vampires than Abe Lincoln.
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Like ram
<Barbetos> I just had the worst idea ever. Try calling Shizu shizuki.
<thelonecubone|GoW3> and some other stuff
<Barbetos> >if looks could kill
<AdamTheDuck> Dayum Phase4, did you just wake up? XD
<Barbetos> I mean, right?
<Kammerjunk> Because -everbody- knows Abe Lincoln is a badass.
<CriticKitten> I watched the Asylum ripoff of Abe Lincoln Vamp Hunter. It was so bad.
<CriticKitten> And not bad funny. Just bad.
<Barbetos> so ded
<Kammerjunk> Haha. If looks could kill indeed.
<Barbetos> you guys don't even know
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, yeah, my sleeping patern is non existant
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: You should try the Uberman cycle.
<thelonecubone|GoW3> damn friendly fire and that torcho Bow ;_;
<Barbetos> I think a bagel and some coffee will bring me back to life.
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: It's absolutely terrible if you miss a nap.
<Phase4> 00,02Kammerjunk, the what now?
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Phase4, nice colors
<Barbetos> If I had a video game, a coffee cup would be my extra life icon.
<Barbetos> IF I where a video game I should say.
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins, now you've ruined it :P
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: The Uberman cycle. 20-30 minute naps every 4 hours.
<Vordox> I wanna PS2...
<Kammerjunk> If you miss one nap, you'll hate everything.
<Phase4> Kammerjunk, it takes me 30 minutes to stop my mind yelling ideas at itself
<DerpyMuffins> Phase4, I would suggest a glass of warm milk
<Kammerjunk> On the bright side, it was the most lucid dreams I've ever had.
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: Oh. Well, that'd be a problem.
<Kammerjunk> Try meditation. Or hell, try archery. It's so relaxing, you don't even.
<DerpyMuffins> Take a shot of espresso Phase4, it should help
<Dark92Enigma> btw, i've seen RainBroDash was back earlier this morning
<DerpyMuffins> If the crash doesn't get you, I would suggest some anti-depressions
<Barbetos> Phase4 It yells? Geez. You should tone that mankey down.
<Shizuka> 13phase you seem like you get how to make easy wool, i needs help ><
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Dark92Enigma: We saw him like 3 nights ago
<Kammerjunk> Make wool?
<Kammerjunk> Am I missing some slang?
<Barbetos> minecraft
<DerpyMuffins> Get a sheep farm Shizuka
<Phase4> Shizuka, ?
<Dark92Enigma> thelonecubone|GoW3: what's his signature mod color?
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Shizuka> 13i'm no good fencing up sheep and such
<Barbetos> Phase4 that does not build confidence.
<CriticKitten> Sheep farm? o.O
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Dark92Enigma: I cant remember >.< but he did kick LC without signing in
<Barbetos> Yeah. One of the best farms I ever saw involved minecarts and an open pasture.
<BaconMane> 0,5>>
<Phase4> Shizuka, direwolf pack?
<Shizuka> 13ja
<Shizuka> 13minus portal plus logistics, same as before
<Barbetos> The mods have spoken!!
<Barbetos> Sacrifice the sheep!
<Shizuka> 13warehouse is done, afaik all the ores that can be doubled are being doubled
<Shizuka> 13we won't be for want of rubber
<Kammerjunk> Well, it's no fun if you're only sacrificing sheep.
<Barbetos> I used to play black and white.
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai BaconMane
<Kammerjunk> Besides, Friday is the best day for sacrificing. So much fresh meat.
<Dark92Enigma> Phase4: minecra---oh, i was too late
<Barbetos> Evil all the way. Sacrificing children like it was going out of style.
<Kammerjunk> Barbetos: Black & White the God game?
<Kammerjunk> Man, I loved that.
<Barbetos> Oh yes
<Barbetos> That game was really genius
<Barbetos> It was just hard to understand
<Phase4> aparently my computer lost the modpacks
<Kammerjunk> Shame Lionhead seems too focused on Fable now.
<Phase4> gimi sec to download
<Barbetos> And keeping your pet sane was a chore in itself. you could go from teaching it not to throw poo, punish it, and it some how learns to not poo ever.
<Kammerjunk> Oh god, I know.
<Barbetos> Thats also my review for that game.
<Barbetos> XD
<Kammerjunk> I eventually gave up and went evil. Let the bugger do whatever it wanted to.
<Kammerjunk> Being evil also gave me a lot of mana.
<Barbetos> Yeah. Bring it out to get converts every now and then. I always seemed to have an issue with my creatures wanting to be good, even though I was evil
<Barbetos> Eh. Worked wonders for coverting new villages
<Barbetos> I am sure the whip lash experience was not lost to said villagers.
<Kammerjunk> Well, being an evil God, I had my Creature on the Soldier role half the time, anyway.
<Kammerjunk> I'm talking about the second game, by the way.
<Barbetos> Wasn't that the sequal?
<Barbetos> I never played it.
<Barbetos> I played the first one.
<Kammerjunk> Oh. What a shame.
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, I played the first one, but I've been having trouble finding a proper version again.
<Phase4> uh....
<Barbetos> When Pokemon Black and White came out I was so confused when people talked about it. I immediately always thought about the Loinhead games
<Phase4> Shizuka, it tells me i'm mising omnitools, stevescarts, computercraft, [various other things[
<Shizuka> 13i think FTB screwed up their launcher
<Kammerjunk> I still get confused from time to other. I keep just assuming they were talking about the Lionhead game and just talked about it as if they'd know.
<Phase4> looks like
<Kammerjunk> Let to a lot of confusion.
<Shizuka> 13the Direwolf20 line is actually voxelbox
<Phase4> i clearly see computercraft in the mod lists
<Barbetos> Thats a game I should sink time into. Minecraft. has so many mods now I should really revisit it.
<Barbetos> I only played survival maps when it was in alpha/beta
<Kammerjunk> Spent a few days in these holidays creating a factory 64x64 from bedrock to the sky.
<Kammerjunk> Didn't do much productive.
<DerpyMuffins> Phase4 I hope you're running the same versions Shizu is running
<Phase4> it's the same version
<Phase4> just missing mod packs
<Phase4> ohai Lyra`
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Lyra`
<Lyra`> oh hey babe
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Ohai Lyra`
<DerpyMuffins> Long time no see Lyra`
<CrystalPhoenix> Well Discrod by LivingTombstone won the #1 spot of top 100 2012 in everfree network

<AdamTheDuck> Hello Vectasus
<Lyra`> falso
<Lyra`> my cheeks are burning
<Lyra`> and my body feels cuddly
<DerpyMuffins> Alcohol again Lyra`?
<Lyra`> who wants a hug?
<Tie> sudden kersplosion. that is all.
*Lyra` nuzzle nuzzle snuggle huggle
<DerpyMuffins> Are you drunk again?
<DerpyMuffins> Key word again
<Lyra`> when am i not?
<Lyra`> also, there are 169 people in her <3
<Lyra`> *here
<Tie> lol 169
<Phase4> Shizuka, all the mods are clearly there, same as the client i was using last time
<Lyra`> ikr! Tie
<Phase4> i've no idea why it wont work
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh free hugs? :$
<Shizuka> 13hm
<DerpyMuffins> I'll take a hug Lyra`
<Shizuka> 13can MultiMC export an instance?
<BladedWings> free hugs? I like hugs ^_^
<Phase4> no idea what multimc is
<Lyra`> Shizuka is my second favorite mod, because SuperBrony64 is my most favorite one, but i like shizuka because shes a strong independant black woman who dont need NO man
<Shizuka> 13better minecraft launcher, can maintain multiple instances with different mods or different minecraft versions
<DerpyMuffins> Yup, she's drunk again
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Animaniacs Coming to The Hub!
<Tie> Yup, Lyra`. It's fun until 469. Then you get this awkward square of flesh.
<Barbetos> Lyra` hey that is my line. =|
<Lyra`> meow
<Lyra`> Barbetos, i am a strong independant black woman who dont need you, because you be a man
<Barbetos> Its kay though you can use it XD
<Buytoast> they're just now talking about the Hub getting Animaniacs?
<Buytoast> how goddamn slow can Sir Dragongroper be?
<Lyra`> did anyone else hear that G4 the television channel is shutting down?
<Tie> Cactus. that is all.
<Phase4> hub's getting anmaniacs?
<Phase4> neat
<CrystalPhoenix> Lyra`, GOOD
<Lyra`> and dat makes me sad
<CrystalPhoenix> That channel was shit
<Barbetos> It was alright
<thelonecubone|GoW3> what CrystalPhoenix said
<Lyra`> CrystalPhoenix, go buck a duck
<DerpyMuffins> I'm so conflicted
<Lyra`> i liked G4
<Barbetos> It just made me kind of board though.
<Kandarihu> Lyra`, I heard.
<AdamTheDuck> Lyra`, D:
<CrystalPhoenix> Lyra`, Tech.tv was perfect as it was
<Barbetos> I never got to see its good stuff aparently.
<Tie> I liked G4
<AdamTheDuck> I don't want to be bucked ;~;
<CriticKitten> G4 deserves to be shut down. They were really not that good at catering to their audience, and then sorta gave up on catering to their audience entirely.
<CrystalPhoenix> G4 came in and ate Tech.TV
<Lyra`> oh AdamTheDuck <3
<DerpyMuffins> G4 was fun while it lasted
<DerpyMuffins> Now it's ded
<Tie> sadface of doom
<Barbetos> Their target audience could not be bothered to watch tv in the first place
<CrystalPhoenix> What happened to Icon, Cinematech, the OLD X-Play
<Barbetos> so there lies the problem right?
<Lyra`> i liked attack of the show
<Tie> YUS^
<CrystalPhoenix> attack of the show was horrible
<Lyra`> and friday was their last episode.
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: 192MB, want me to just zip and send?
<Lyra`> well then CrystalPhoenix, there is no pleasing you.
<Phase4> Shizuka, might as well
<CrystalPhoenix> Lyra`, not from G4
<Tie> Exactly. GTFO
<Lyra`> and you are an unpleasable mess, who will grow old lonely
<Phase4> far as i can tell everythings correct here
<Lyra`> so mew mew mew mew mew, and buck you too
<CrystalPhoenix> You're awfully quick to make such assumption
<Lyra`> shush, ive forgive you and i love you dearly
<Tie> INTERNET FIGHT!!!
<Lyra`> now hug me.
<CrystalPhoenix> I'm not a fan of E-hugs
<Tie> awww. it was getting good
<Barbetos> Hugs are two fiddy around here now
<Lyra`> then pay up.
<BaconMane> 0,5No U
<Barbetos> Broke.
<Barbetos> I spent all my money on hugs
<Tie> No money here.
*AdamTheDuck e-hugs CrystalPhoenix :P
<Barbetos> I am hopelessly addicted.
<DerpyMuffins> Wrong chat BaconMane?
<Lyra`> BaconMane, i demand you talk to me in a private chat.
<BaconMane> 0,5>.>.....
<CrystalPhoenix> Lyra is better as a music student and not an anthropology addict
<Tie> OH SNAP
<Lyra`> you dont even know me, CrystalPhoenix
<Barbetos> Anthropology was good though
<CrystalPhoenix> Lyra`, I said the character
<Lyra`> ^
<DerpyMuffins> I know you're drunk Lyra`
<CrystalPhoenix> the song was good
<Barbetos> Its what got me to read anything lyra related
<Lyra`> champagn
<CrystalPhoenix> but Lyra is better as a music student than an anthropology addict still
<Barbetos> I mean that is how I started to read Background Pony
<Phase4> Shizuka, i figured out what happened >_<
<Tie> Background Pony is BOSS
<Shizuka> 13uh oh what
<Phase4> Shizuka, there was an update, all my mods are slightly the wrong version
<CrystalPhoenix> Background Pony is amazing
<Shizuka> 13yeah thought so
<Shizuka> 13server doesn't know how to update FTB pack anyway so that's kind of a dumb thing for them to do
<DerpyMuffins> Told ya to check the versions Phase4
<Lyra`> meyow
<CrystalPhoenix> and I do admit I don't enjoy some of the ridiculousness fanon that the community makes out
<Tie> uh oh... sexual meows.
<kidzrul732> my mom is baking cookies and I just got back from yelling at my video game.
<CrystalPhoenix> like associating Vinyl with dubstep
<DerpyMuffins> Why is Lyra into humans in the first place?
<Shizuka> 13actually it weighs 180MB... but should be faster coming from mediafire
<NocturnalBlade> stupid internet :|
<DerpyMuffins> I never understood that
<CrystalPhoenix> can't she just be a normal DJ that has a very vast selection of music?
<DerpyMuffins> Disk Jockey
<kidzrul732> hey bronies did you ever yell at a video game?
<AdamTheDuck> DerpyMuffins, she was seen sitting "like a human"
<CrystalPhoenix> kidzrul732, I did many times
<NocturnalBlade> kidzrul732: all...the...time lol
<DerpyMuffins> So?
<DerpyMuffins> All ponies sit like that
<DerpyMuffins> It's been made canon
<CrystalPhoenix> ^^^^^^^^^^^
<Tie> true dat but it is still nice sometimes, CrystalPhoenix. Vinyl Scratch being paired with dubstep and other things of the sort does make sense.
<AdamTheDuck> But wasn't she seen sitting down early in season 1?
<kidzrul732> My parents kept telling me to stop because of my swearing. But I'm almost an adult they can't tell me what to do!
<Dark92Enigma> kidzrul732: who didn't?
<AdamTheDuck> When most ponies were seen only laying down
<CrystalPhoenix> Tie, it's ok and all but collectively accepting it as fact?
<CrystalPhoenix> heck remember the whole eye incident
<Phase4> now i've run into a new bug
<Tie> Tru, Tru
<CrystalPhoenix> people made up excuses to keep her eyes red
<CrystalPhoenix> it's sickening
<Tie> I for one like the red eyes concept.
<Tie> Is it cannon, No
<CrystalPhoenix> Magenta is cuter, fits the universe more
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<kidzrul732> My parents want me to stop swearing. But they can't tell me what to do
<CrystalPhoenix> I hated her eyes red
<AdamTheDuck> <3 Magenta
<Lyra`> i love cerulian
<Tie> sudden silence
<Barbetos> kidzrul732 well I agree with you to an extent, but consider that constantly swearing only dumbs down your vocabulary.
<Barbetos> It did for me for years.
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/xi0Pr.jpg
<Shizuka> 13MY BRAND
<NocturnalBlade> lol
<Sandvich> No... adultzrul732 :P

<Shizuka> 13http://fav.me/d5po2wx
<CrystalPhoenix> mostly because of how Discord- LivingTombstone got #1 in EVN top100 songs 2012
<CrystalPhoenix> EFN**
<NocturnalBlade> of course it did lol
<CrystalPhoenix> it piss me off though
<sub06905> dat applejack~
<CrystalPhoenix> for 1 the original is way better
<pinkiepoop> applegak?
<CrystalPhoenix> for 2 there are way better songs than discord in general
<Barbetos> The kick message should kick it self, saying the g word like that
<Barbetos> I am offend and this makes me feel name
<Lyra`> god?

<AdamTheDuck> Kammerjunk, right

<DocSane> J_E_Smith71: Thanks.
<rdibp> gee, it sure is boring around here.
<TheBucket> Dark_Horst: It's a pet we can dress up and make pretty. Doesn't require feeding, which makes it optimal as a cheaper alternative to more expensive, high-maintenance pets such as cats, dogs, and ponies.
<Everlasting_Joy> Rex_Mundi: One of the best party games of all time... Of all time!
<DocSane> Ah... I just bought "Just Cause 2" for $3.72 on Steam.

<DerpyMuffins> Lesson Zero was all about Celestia trolling Twilight
<NocturnalBlade> in order is probably best lol thank Luna for netflix lol
<Brad_> "mah beats!!!!!!"
<PonyGuyRulz> exactly
<Ninjazz> Christian_Carter, I recommend watching the episodes first before you get involved with the fandom.
<Methology> I know, so funny
<AVS619> lol i started at season 2 ep 19 for some reason
<DerpyMuffins> S3 was just to confirm head canons
<Christian_Carter> Who else is in the series besides all of the ponies above(except the girl randomly looking @ spike)
<DerpyMuffins> And make references
<PonyGuyRulz> msny many side characters
<PonyGuyRulz> many
<NocturnalBlade> wait girl?
<NocturnalBlade> like human?
<DerpyMuffins> There is no human in Equestria

<Ninjazz> Dee Jay Pone Three.
<PonyGuyRulz> aka DJ-PON3
<Christian_Carter> who are they
<DerpyMuffins> Derpy Doo
<Everto> The amount of people and lights inside generate more heat than necessary
<Ninjazz> Derpy Hooves/ Ditzy Doo.
<DashWithRainbows> Like you said, background ponies.
<Christian_Carter> who is Lyra, i want to know
<Derpy_Hooves> me
<Everto> They even run air conditioners in the winter because it gets too hot.
<Christian_Carter> *Facepalm*
<DerpyMuffins> Dat Derpy_Hooves
<Methology> Really?
<DashWithRainbows> They have no major roles, they just stay in the background.
<Christian_Carter> not that "Dat" reference
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<DashWithRainbows> The fandom gave them their names.
<PonyGuyRulz> derpy hooves is brony pony
<Christian_Carter> ok
<NocturnalBlade> DashWithRainbows: some stick
<DerpyMuffins> Derpy was born on 4Chan
<Christian_Carter> I'm done watching episode 1!
<thelonecubone> The fandom Gave her the name Derpy
<Christian_Carter> NOT 4CHAN!
<PonyGuyRulz> and its actually canon
<Christian_Carter> I was banned for illegal post
<Derpy_Hooves> bronies originated from 4chan
<DashWithRainbows> ^
<DashWithRainbows> It's true.
<thelonecubone> ^^
<Christian_Carter> i put marijuana is for everyone
<Ninjazz> More specifically /co/.
<Derpy_Hooves> .\/b/ to be exact
<Christian_Carter> and i was banned
<Ninjazz> It grew on /b/ though...
<Derpy_Hooves> well the term brony came from /b/
<DerpyMuffins> Good times
<Christian_Carter> i finally understand ponies
<TheBucket> Then there was spam
<Derpy_Hooves> i joined around the fandom around gthe end of S1
<Christian_Carter> after saying their names
<Christian_Carter> Who is celestia anyways
<Ninjazz> Derpy_Hooves, actually it started on /co/ too. It just got popular on /b/ too.
<NocturnalBlade> Christian_Carter: Princess...and damn good troll :D
<Derpy_Hooves> Ninjazz: the term brony originated from /b/ though
<TheBucket> Christian_Carter: Celestia is a character on Mirror's Edge
<Christian_Carter> Troll?Why?
<PonyGuyRulz> https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=478635795511688&set=a.201483099893627.46907.201110553264215&type=1&theater
<DerpyMuffins> Celestia is a troll
<AVS619> ^
<TheBucket> Oh wait, that was Celeste
<NocturnalBlade> Christian_Carter: you'll get it later in the fandom lol
<Ninjazz> Derpy_Hooves, I saw a screen cap of the very first time it was used, it was on /co/.
<Derpy_Hooves> why are you guys just throwing fanon stuff at him D:
<Christian_Carter> my friend wants me to join in fandom ASAP
<TheBucket> Christian_Carter: Do you like bananas?
<Derpy_Hooves> "celestia is a troll" is a fanon
<Derpy_Hooves> not canon
<TheBucket> Christian, do you like bananas?
<thelonecubone> TheBucket: let him watch the episodes and videos, and then you ask
<Christian_Carter> I'm from new orleans(Originally from atlanta/st.louis)
<DashWithRainbows> TheBucket He's new, he wouldn't get the joke.
<Derpy_Hooves> exactly
<NocturnalBlade> Christian_Carter: he shouldnt rush you into the fandom
<Christian_Carter> Brb

<Everto> Cool story bro
<Christian_Carter> Back
<DerpyMuffins> Celestia
<Derpy_Hooves> the pony fandom is not meant for all, there are those who love it, those who are obessed with it, those who hate it, those who think it's cancer, and those who are forced/rushed into the fandom
<Stormy> don't even bother arguing with people about that stuff
<DerpyMuffins> Trolestia
<Stormy> I learned that a while ago
<DerpyMuffins> Molestia
<Everto> Like skateboard rider cool
<Stormy> it's pretty much a waste of time
<Everto> Wearing sunglasses
<Everto> At night
<Christian_Carter> i like my little pony
<DerpyMuffins> Uhh
<Eddmario> Futashy > Fluttershy

<NocturnalBlade> DerpyMuffins: Tyrant Celestia
<Everto> That's how cool it is
<Christian_Carter> but i didn't think they like it THIS much
<Derpy_Hooves> Christian_Carter: but are you new to the fandom?

<Christian_Carter> cool university
<Derpy_Hooves> Christian_Carter: then don't listen to some of these people, at least watch a few episdoes to get a feel about how every character acts, cause most of the time, the first things people hear about the show's characters, are what they end up beiliving
<Derpy_Hooves> c:
<Ninjazz> ^
<Christian_Carter> ok
<NocturnalBlade> agreed Derpy_Hooves
<thelonecubone> do what Derpy_Hooves said

<NocturnalBlade> Christian_Carter: your choise dude
<Deadlypon3> ponybee FUCK HIM!
<ponny> im just saying if you're watching a show that is aimed towards little girls then maybe you should reevaluate your life
<NocturnalBlade> *choice
<berberborscing> That willc ripple your mind for a few weeks.
<berberborscing> It's not porn. It's a story of an alien in the woods.
<pony_mcdonalds> ponny then why are you here haha
<twilight_sprinkle> ponny: so im guessing youre not a brony then?
<Deadlypon3> ponny I revaluated it and it's AWESOME
<pony_mcdonalds> its a fun show judging is for losers
<ponybee> ponny who are you to say these things?

<Derpy_Hooves> you what annoys the piss out of me?
<Christian_Carter> This is now an "Awkward moment when"
<Christian_Carter> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama
<NocturnalBlade> berberborscing: ah yes, i have heard of this now lol

<Deadlypon3> Ponny Fluttershy is best poneh!
<Alipony> That's mean. :(
<ponny> it's just my opinion, no offense meant
<berberborscing> Instead of that fucker chasing me, I'd rather have 173 kick off my head
<ponybee> think before you say things, ponny
<Derpy_Hooves> the bronies that are obsessed with the show, yeah i like the show, every saturday im all like "oh yay new episode" i watch it, then i get back to my life and get something productive done

<berberborscing> On chat 24/7
<Buytoast> what
<Christian_Carter> Hey ponybee, how long have you been a brony?
<Deadlypon3> The Mods are actually machines that are transplanted in the chat :p
<Derpy_Hooves> but there are so i see every saturday that are "nothing is better than ponies" "ponies are the best" no, a job, having money to put food on the table, and friends/family
<ponybee> can we stop talking about personal lives? it's making me a bit jealous and oppressed
<Derpy_Hooves> that is the best
<ponybee> well, christian_carter, it's been 2 years
<Buytoast> you don't need a family
<Christian_Carter> ok sheesh
<joshua113> its ok ponybee your not alone
<berberborscing> I'm 13, so I ain't got no personal life. Just a sucky middle school one.
<Buytoast> kids are annoying and you can't trust anyone
<Drew> So true
<Deadlypon3> Speaking of personal lifes, I got that FBI screen lock thing fixed :D
<pony_mcdonalds> well i've been a brony since for a few months my last boyfriends got me in2

<Deadlypon3> Ponny 18
<Derpy_Hooves> remember me saying that?
<pony_mcdonalds> it's so cute
<Ninjazz> In the end, you can only trust yourself and that edge you live on.
<pony_mcdonalds> :D
<ponny> how old*
<ponybee> christian_carter, how old are you? a/s/l?
<Buytoast> i meant getting married and having children

<Buytoast> and no
<Christian_Carter> my girlfriend likes my little pony and she talked me into mlp
<Buytoast> I dont

<twilight_sprinkle> top tip people
<joshua113> im 20
<ponny> i'm 16 :)
<Derpy_Hooves> so i have a question: is ponny a brony, or is he a troll that is taking the "calm, nice, and professional" approach?
<ponybee> can't trust them
<twilight_sprinkle> you need to be at least 14 to be here
<Ninjazz> Sorry, sewpony. You probably shouldn't be in here. +14 chat recommended.
<pony_mcdonalds> o great i'm 19!
<Christian_Carter> are you in college
<berberborscing> It's alright. As long as we don't curse or post porn, we should be fine.
<twilight_sprinkle> so at least pretend youre 14 and dont break the rules
<pony_mcdonalds> not right now
<pony_mcdonalds> i just waitress

<Christian_Carter> I'm kidding bro
<ponny> i dream about them a lot
<Deadlypon3> twilight_sprinkle computers scare me :'(
<Derpy_Hooves> he is taking the professional calm approach
<berberborscing> I like horses, but not the sexual way.
<snowypony> what kind of dreams? :O
<Deadlypon3> They always die on me
<Derpy_Hooves> nice choice
<Christian_Carter> Done With Episode 8
<ponybee> wait, is it wrong to like horses in a sexual way?
<Derpy_Hooves> most trolls don't use that option'
<Christian_Carter> I like the series so far
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: eh you should learn to use them well
<ponybee> i thought this was an open place

<ponybee> alright, i'll take that note to heart and conduct myself
<Jmo> A fishing wizard.

<twilight_sprinkle> sewpony: yeah. but i wouldnt recommend going there, it can be a nasty place
<berberborscing> Ashushing.
<Ninjazz> The best there is. c:
<Deadlypon3> I thought I was going to be arrested for my pony love by the FBI when I realized a Virus/Trojan locked me out of my computer ponybee
<NocturnalBlade> ponny: but there are rules and regulations that go along with being here

*Jmo slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
<fluttercry> 05,15That's quite alright, I'm already deathly afraid of spiders I don't need ones that can kill me in 15 minutes
<Jmo> I let spiders live in my room, it's fun.
<fluttercry> 05,15also, Box Jellyfish
<Ninjazz> Jeesus Jaymeow.
<fluttercry> 05,15lolnope
<Jmo> I wanna be stung by a jellyfish.
<NightSide15> its not so bad here
<Java> fluttercry: Actually Cassowary (or Kasuari in the local language) are from West Papua. West Papua is part of Indonesia, not Australia
<fluttercry> 05,15I'll stay here in the eastern US where all I have to worry about are Black Widows and Rattlesnakes
<sub06905> box spider jellyfish
<NightSide15> Dont forget the Sharks
<Jmo> Ninjazz, what? They're cool to let them roam around and make families.
<Ninjazz> I read that as Battlesnakes.
<fluttercry> 05,15Jmo they can also KILL YOU
<berberborscing> Sep. 29th, 2421, Asteroid 1999 RQ36 will be 511,000 kilometers from Earth. (really fuckin close)
<Jmo> Na
<Java> fluttercry: Maybe you're talking about Emu birds?
<fluttercry> 05,15Java maybe
<Jmo> I leave them alone, they leave me alone.
<Jmo> I feed them, they treat me well and eat the flies.
<berberborscing> That's like as close as the moon.
<Ninjazz> Jaymeow, spiders disturb me. My brother freaks the fuck out but I just hate their legs.
<Java> Maybe everyone all over the world need to yell "GO AWAY METEOR" and the meteor will be like "Okay"
<Jmo> I wish I had a camera when I was living on the farm
<fluttercry> 05,15Java Cassowaries live in the NE of Australia
<Jmo> Oh the spiders we had there. <3
<fluttercry> 05,15ARE THERE ANY SAFE PLACES THERE?
<Java> fluttercry: Papua too.
<Ninjazz> e_e
<Java> I own one once.
<NightSide15> only the tough survive in Australia
<Java> The meat is good, a little bit hard though
<Ninjazz> I should Straya and Zealand sometime, and bonus I won't be jetlagged bad.
<Jmo> Come join me darling.
<Jmo> I have trout waiting.
<Ninjazz> I can't wait.
<fluttercry> 05,15So, the water is filled with box jellyfish that can kill you in minutes, sharks, and stingrays. The land is filled with dingos, funnel web spiders, giant birds, and snakes.
<Java> Even though I like Bird of Paradise more http://www.breakaway.cc/Wildlife/asia/birdParadise01.jpg
<fluttercry> 05,15How do people survive!
<Jmo> Common sense.
<Jmo> And survival instincts.
<Ninjazz> The box jellyfish don't kill you in minutes. You just feel agony for a good long while then die.
<Jmo> Wait, this guy is from Perth.
<sub06905> Jmo is master survivor
<NightSide15> im from Perth
<Java> Ninjazz: That's not helping :/
<berberborscing> When he said your but and the chair, I assume that 99.9 % of people watch science videos with﻿ pants on.
<Ninjazz> Java, blame the Discovery Channel.
<fluttercry> 05,15On the bright side, they are able to copy UK shows without ruining them
<fluttercry> 05,15unlike us
<Jmo> Damn

<berberborscing> I love spiders. :D
<fluttercry> 05,15I hate hate hate hate hate hate wasps and bees
<Jmo> You'd love Australia
<Jmo> We got all of those.
<Java> fluttercry: Spiders are awesome
<NightSide15> the only things i really hate are Spiders and snakes
<berberborscing> Spiders rule.
<Ninjazz> XAX, lol'd.
<NightSide15> but you get used to these things in Australia
<Java> fluttercry: Try to google hag fish
<Jmo> Except some don't get used to the heat.
<Jmo> EHERM.
<NightSide15> true
<fluttercry> 05,15Snakes are fine, hell I've fought snakes and won. But I cry like a bitch when bees and wasps are around
<Jmo> wat. >_>
<NightSide15> hahahaha
<Jmo> I enjoy being stung by bees, tis interesting.
<berberborscing> Once I was parked in my car at Blockbuster with my window open and a bee landed in my lap.
<Java> Jmo: Hot? I don't feel hot at all when I was in Melbourne.
<Noir> Quick quiestion: who here is excited to hear that Animainiacs are comeing to the Hub on the 7th?
<NightSide15> im fine with bees and wasps, man i just got stung by a wasp yesterday
<berberborscing> You know what I did?
<Jmo> Good :P
<Java> Noir: Someone need to stream animaniacs here in Bronystate
<berberborscing> I got a piece of paper, pushed him on, and stuck it out the window saying "Your free!"
<fluttercry> 05,15A wasp flew into my house once and I responded by locking the door to my room (what's it going to do, open it?) and stuffed blankets under the door so it couldn't get in.
<sub06905> lel
<sub06905> u funny fluttercry
<Jmo> Did you also cry?
<Java> fluttercry: Law of funny: It will get in.
<berberborscing> I learned a really valuable lesson w/ wasps and bees
<berberborscing> I know how to TAME them.
<Jmo> LOl^
<fluttercry> 05,15No, I didn't cry, I had the situation under control
<Ninjazz> Then they tamed you.
<Ponies47> fluttercry, I know dat feel so much ;~;
<Jmo> I'm sure fluttercry :P
<berberborscing> Be calm, and no sudden movements.
<berberborscing> Do not pose a threat.
<NightSide15> the worst i have everdone was throw my phone at a spider in my room.... poor phone, it never recovered
<fluttercry> 05,15I had bad experiences with stinging bugs when I was little
<Ryunosuke> should have used the stare on it :)
<fluttercry> 05,15so I guess the fear just stuck with me
<Java> I learn a good life lesson today: Don't eat too much instant noodles or we will get bad bowel movement.
<Jmo> I still wanna find out why Olly is scared of moths
<berberborscing> Once I was getting in the class from P.E in 1st grade, and out of all things, a queen bee stung my arm three times.
<Java> brb toilet
<Afflict> hey Kimori
<fluttercry> 05,15I also am not a fan of the dark
<Noir> At least it wasn't a snake.
<sub06905> fluttercry, you should put on a bee keeper costume and go to a place with a bunch of bees
<Kimori> hi
<Jmo> I prefer the dark.
<Ninjazz> ^
<Ryunosuke> stepping on a yellowjacket nest barefooted didnt feel exactly pleasant
<NightSide15> <berberborscing> gets all the beeches
<berberborscing> SCP's hide in the dark...
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i saw bees in a building
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but they were in a case with honey comb
<Jmo> I know why you prefer it Ninjazz
<aniderp|bestcakeever> making honey i think

<fluttercry> 05,15Getting stung in the face by a wasp when you are 4 is not fun

<Ninjazz> Of course you know. <_<
*Jmo slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
<Ryunosuke> i was ... 6 i think
<Amu-chan> Oh, people are talking. XD
<Ninjazz> :>
<berberborscing> Well, mine was a queen bee.
<Jmo> Worst that happened to me when I was young was I nearly broke my spine.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> being outside barefoot near bees flying and buzzing is scary
<berberborscing> It can sting you multiply and get away with iot
<Kimori> a little :P
<fluttercry> 05,15Jmo ouch
<aniderp|bestcakeever> when you are little :\
<Kimori> I'm tired -_-
<Jmo> It wasn't fun.
<Ryunosuke> let me tell you, yellowjackets sting like a bitch
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i almost ate a yellow jacket
<Afflict> same
<fluttercry> 05,15worst injury I've ever sustained was impaling my foot on a mini refridgerator coil
<berberborscing> I'm a bit warned around wasps and tellow jackets.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> my cousin saved me and said wait
<aniderp|bestcakeever> that was recently too :\
<NightSide15> oh redbacks why are there soooo many FUCKING redbacks here in Australia
<Jmo> lolredbacks
<NightSide15> i hate redbacks
<berberborscing> It would be like a chest X-Ray if you ate 600 bananas.

<Ryunosuke> I am not inherently afraid of anything, including snakes
<berberborscing> For me, an odd kind of Flutteshy happens.
<Sumica> 00,10still kinda nice to find my old EA games.
<Ryunosuke> however, that does not mean that if I am asleep in the lounge in the back yard and a snake crawls on me, I am not gonna scream like a little girl :p
<fluttercry> 05,15I was stalked by a bear once
<fluttercry> 05,15that was fun
<Jmo> Pedobear coming after you son.
<Ninjazz> Could have been a dude in a bear suit.
<Ninjazz> That shit happens, maaaaan.
<Ryunosuke> did he have a van with "free candy" on the side?
<fluttercry> 05,15unless a man in a bear suit was living in the mountains for no reason
<fluttercry> 05,15I doubt it
<Java> fluttercry: Just bear with it.
<NightSide15> haha:D
<Jmo> >_>
<Ninjazz> Live in the mountains to make sure he doesn't caught. It's possible, maaaaaaan.
<fluttercry> 05,15But yeah, I used to live in a mountainous area and I was hiking with my Dad, ended up having to get out without freaking out and spooking the bear even more
<Java> I read it as "spooning the bear" :/
<Ryunosuke> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlsFGtdSPcI -- this is probbably what he wanted :p
<aniderp|bestcakeever> did it want a cookie?
<fluttercry> 05,15It wanted Fluttercry-Cookies
<NightSide15> good thing there arent any bears where i live
<aniderp|bestcakeever> you know what?
<berberborscing> Uh oh, there's a roach in my coke can...
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im gonna go find a bear and take it back home
<fluttercry> 05,15berberborscing KILL IT WITH FIRE
<aniderp|bestcakeever> and feed it cookies
<Kimori> think ill go to bed now
<Java> aniderp|bestcakeever: Well, you have the right to bear arms anyway.
<Afflict> night
<Kimori> see you all later today :)
<thelonecubone> Ryunosuke: Lol, that scene
<Kimori> night
<Jmo> The puns. It burns.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> oh good idea
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i should throw a sleepy dart at it
<Ninjazz> It's Open Season all over again.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> then it fall asleep and i take it as a pet!
<NightSide15> dat slide show
<Jmo> I'll show you open season Ninjazz.
<Java> Sleepy dart? so it's a dart who don't sleep for days?
<Ninjazz> Oh mai...
<aniderp|bestcakeever> and put a collar on it and leash
<Jmo> Good movie.
<Jmo> <_<
<Ninjazz> Oh. >_>
<aniderp|bestcakeever> good idea?
<Rose`Bed> night
<fluttercry> 05,15Opossum's are freaky too and Racoons
<Java> racoons are awesome
<fluttercry> 05,15They have little hands
<berberborscing> I'm gonna make you guys go crazy with hardest question evfer.
<berberborscing> This question is so hard even Twilight was stumped.
<NightSide15> bring it on
<berberborscing> What color...
<berberborscing> ...is a mirror?
<Ninjazz> Yo mamma.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> it doesnt have a color
<Java> it's yellow
<aniderp|bestcakeever> its a refelction of the person so clear
<aniderp|bestcakeever> spy
<aniderp|bestcakeever> mettalic silver?
<Java> Yellow!
<fluttercry> 05,15Green?
<Ninjazz> Blue.
<Ninjazz> Actually, old time mirrors were made with silver.
<Ninjazz> So...
<aniderp|bestcakeever> gold?
<NightSide15> wouldnt it be multaple colours since it reflects light and in light there are seven colours mixed togethor
<Java> YELLOW!
<aniderp|bestcakeever> silvier alluminum
<berberborscing> The winner is:
<berberborscing> Fluttercry.
<Java> GAH!
<NightSide15> ?
<fluttercry> 05,15I thought that was what I'd heard. Yay me!
<aniderp|bestcakeever> its green silver
<fluttercry> 05,15also, you all need to check out a flash game called Frog Fractions
<berberborscing> If you look through infinite mirrons like in an elevator
<berberborscing> You'll see it dims into a hue of dark green.
<NightSide15> those are creepy
<berberborscing> It reflects green color best.
<NightSide15> what is the meaning of life
<fluttercry> 05,15Watch Monty Python and you'll know
<NightSide15> seen it
<NightSide15> forgot the answer
<Java> Fetch the cow
<berberborscing> The meaning of life is survival.
<NightSide15> i really want to go to bronycon

<Gold_Demona> racistbarn: more than 6 talks in the span of 10 seconds is autokick.
<thelonecubone> stop typing for a bit
<DaringDerpy> 5 messages in 10 seconds or so means autokick
<DaringDerpy> the numbers can vary
<Java> then he suddenly went quiet
<killerpony7733> Hes probably some douche bag who thinks hes being funny by annoying people and all
<sub06905> so anywho.. Sumica what game is this?

<Gold_Demona> Yumyumyum
<d3rb> toasted chese tomato and deli meat sandwich
<d3rb> mmm
<Java> trash? what a waste
<Etharian> seems fair
<Gold_Demona> I had some deli meats last night as movie snacks. It was gewd. :>
<SirGanjalf> Oh and mornin' everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Good morning SirGanjalf

<DaringDerpy> hi SirGanjalf
<sub06905> ello SirGanjalf
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo SirGanjalf
<thelonecubone> Hi SirGanjalf :)
<Java> hello SirGanjalf
<DaringDerpy> don't get too attached to them
<Moopy> Hey i got a question for everypony in the chat: how do you use skype?
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 Sumi dies
<sub06905> just noticed that face at the bottom right of stream
<sub06905> xD
<DaringDerpy> activate the weapons
<Gold_Demona> Moopy: What do you mean?
<Java> Can it run on old computers? like 7 years old laptop with pentium celeron 1.7 and 2 GB ram?
<DaringDerpy> I repeat, activate the weapons!
<Moopy> you know like how to use skype
<Gold_Demona> Moopy: What do you mean "how to use it"?
<Java> take their rum
<Gold_Demona> Moopy: Be specific
<Moopy> You don't know what im talking about do you Gold_Demona?
<Gold_Demona> Moopy: Now you're confusing me.
<Moopy> *SIGH*
<Gold_Demona> Moopy: I thought I did, but now I don't know.
<Java> Good guy Sumica, sdon't accept any bribe!
<Java> ded
<DaringDerpy> did you start on normal level, Sumica? you will die quickly.
<Gold_Demona> Moopy: I just don't get what you mean by "use" Skype.
<Moopy> Just forget it Gold_Demona
<DaringDerpy> I never beat the game on normal
<AdamTheDuck> DaringDerpy, hehe, normal is brutal XD
<Java> DaringDerpy is a baaaaaabeh!
<Java> :p
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, you have no idea how hard normal is :P
<Ryunosuke> Spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
<Gold_Demona> Moopy: Well, what exactly are you trying to do with it? Are you trying to add people to your list? Are you trying to chat with someone? Are you trying to find someone? How exactly are you "using" it specifically?
<Gold_Demona> Cuz just saying "use it" doesn't really say anything.
<Moopy> Really Gold_Demona you had to ask all that......................really
*DaringDerpy bites Java's head off
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, get someone to repair the shields
<Gold_Demona> Moopy: Well....?
<DaringDerpy> ded
*Java grew another new head in seconds
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 ships blows up
<Moopy> No comment
<Buytoast> what's this then?
<killerpony7733-> Sumica The irony of shizu burning to death
<DaringDerpy> open the blast doors
<Buytoast> this that SPAZ game?
<AdamTheDuck> Shizuuuu nuuuu XD
<DaringDerpy> fire needs oxygen
<Java> Poor captain got scorched
<sub06905> sumi is best space pilot
<DaringDerpy> not all of them
<Etharian> Yeah, stay the course!
<DaringDerpy> it dies
<AdamTheDuck> 93 XD
<DaringDerpy> new high score
<Java> And now Sumica become a baby :p
<DaringDerpy> they will all die
<sub06905> should of had a Normal and Hard mode insted of Easy and Normal
<DaringDerpy> this fire was nothing dramatic. you could have survived it with a full crew and a slightly damaged ship
<Etharian> I must demand you get a crew cosisted entirely of psycho midgets... I play too much borderlands...
<DaringDerpy> shield first, then weapons
<DaringDerpy> hull breach
<Etharian> anyone else get an add just now?
<Java> Repair drone? sounds good
<DaringDerpy> most of us have adblock, Etharian
<DaringDerpy> if the useless sensors worked, you knew where
<Etharian> :'(
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, jump out and then repair
<DaringDerpy> oh, right
<Java> Etharian: Go get adblock or ghostery
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, FTL out I mean
<Etharian> how do I get adblock
<Java> Etharian: What browser do you use?
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, first off, the room with the camera
<Moopy> are you trying to down load google chrome dude
<DaringDerpy> this is bad
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, allows you to see the ship without the crew having to check
<Etharian> Chrome
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, then the room with the 2 rectangles allow you to control the locks on the doors remotely
<Java> Etharian: Go get ghostery. It's available for Opera and Chrome
<Etharian> k thx
<DaringDerpy> look at which are open
<Moopy> Don't down load chrome dude it makes the youtube videos lag a little and it makes it makes the sound videos in slow motion
<DaringDerpy> only the weapon room has vacuum
<Java> Technology this advanced and they don't have automatic fire extenguisher system
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, as you can see they are both destroyed and you need both of them to 1 see where the fire is, and 2 to starve the fire of oxygen by opening the right doors
<DaringDerpy> at least the oxygen didn'T fail
<Java> or fire extenguisher bot
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, just open all the doors except the med room and the fire will go away
<AdamTheDuck> curse this delayed stream >.>
<DaringDerpy> everything's cool
<DaringDerpy> you just lost two redshirts
<DaringDerpy> everything else is fine
<Java> Only 1 crew remaining? poor guy for a maiden voyage
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Wrek :<
*Ponies47 sits on AdamTheDuck 's head
<AdamTheDuck> D:
*AdamTheDuck uses splash on Ponies47 >:3
<Ponies47> ;~;
<Java> I can imagine the crew is like "yay we explore the space!" but after 1 battle "OH GOD WHY?!"
<DaringDerpy> saving is for casuals
<taoumi> you can save but if you die it deletes the save
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, no save, one life and that's it :P
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome to FTL~
<DaringDerpy> If you mastered FTL, try Dwarf Fortress
<Java> cough
<taoumi> took me like....3-4 tires to beat it on easy
<DaringDerpy> taoumi: and on normal?
<taoumi> 5-7
<Java> taoumi: That's a lot of tires
<DaringDerpy> better than me. I never beat it on normal
<taoumi> that engi ship does wonders
<sub06905> this game is reminding me of kerbals
<DaringDerpy> shields go in blocks of two
<taoumi> the ion cannon is a far under rated wepon DaringDerpy
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, shields are different, you need 2 upgrades for one shield block
<Java> sub06905: this is Kerbal after they finally able to explore space. But they die horribly in space battles
<thelonecubone> sub06905 but less explosions
<sub06905> kerbals 2.0
<thelonecubone> well, I got to, it's 4:30 am over her >.>
<thelonecubone> here*
<thelonecubone> go*
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight thelonecubone :$
<thelonecubone> damn it >.<
<taoumi> buy the ion cannon first chance.
<taoumi> night thelonecubone
*AdamTheDuck tucks thelonecubone into bed :P
<Moopy> octavia you wanted me a peace of that ca~ 0-o
<sub06905> night thelonecubone
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, attack!
<d3rb> cya thelonecubone
<DaringDerpy> aim for the shields with the first shot, then for the weapons
<thelonecubone> thanks for the stream Sumica :)
<sub06905> inb4 ded
<DaringDerpy> if you are lucky, they have no chance to fire at you
<SirGanjalf> Yeah, attack those rebel-i mean, slaver scums!
<SirGanjalf> ooh,
<Java> Green skinned slave girl?
<SirGanjalf> you have freed them from life too:P
<taoumi> loot
<SirGanjalf> the lewt!
<berberborscing> Windows has encountered a problem with your entire computer. It seems to have been replaced with a giant potato.
<Java> At least potato taste good stewed with meat.
<sub06905> time to cook some ramen
<sub06905> :>
<AdamTheDuck> What happened to good-guy Sumica? XD
<Gold_Demona> I need to go get me some breakfast.
<AdamTheDuck> See you in a bit Gold_Demona :P
<Java> Gold_Demona: KFC breakfast?
<Gold_Demona> Java: Hell no. Real breakfast. A nice big bowl o' cereal.
<Gold_Demona> Or a plate of scrambled eggs. I haven't decided
<DaringDerpy> only if the shield is down
<Java> Gold_Demona: But they are good! http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VfTGSRAoPiY/T4BqcLCauiI/AAAAAAAAGpY/2oHqGBcIKnU/s1600/13287-thumb-323399_10150292176545843_63398470842_8521810_163957571_o.jpg
<Java> cough
<Gold_Demona> I don't do fast food breakfast. =/
<taoumi> the ion cannon cna strip shilds and turn off a system if i hits directly
<Gold_Demona> Besides, the closest KFC to me is too far away to be worth the trouble
<Java> Gold_Demona: It only took me 5 minutes to walk to the nearest KFC
<Java> I win
<Gold_Demona> Also that would mean leaving my house, which would mean getting dressed and decent and doing my hair and all this other crap I don't feel like doing.
<taoumi> just keep the ion cannon aimed at eather sheilds or wepons
<Java> Just wear a white t shirt and wear a short jeans or something
<Gold_Demona> I don't change out of my PJs unless I'm intent on leaving the house.
<Gold_Demona> And my hair's a pain in the ass
<Java> Go to KFC in you pj then
<Java> let it wild
<AdamTheDuck> XD
<Gold_Demona> Ew no
<Gold_Demona> Leave the house looking like a redneck, I don't think so.
<taoumi> gona need the power and sheilds
<taoumi> can alwase turn it on if they get husrt
<DaringDerpy> the sickbay is good for fighting boarding crews
<taoumi> take it
<Gold_Demona> What exactly is the object of this game? O_o
<taoumi> to get to the other side Gold_Demona
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, get from one side of the galaxy to the other
<SirGanjalf> to get to the infinity and beyond!
<AdamTheDuck> Wait, why do we try to get there again taoumi?
<WillyCypress> *
<Java> cough
<taoumi> becasue plot? AdamTheDuck
<Gold_Demona> So I guess the bar thingy on top is your progress across the galaxy? Cuz I don't actually see any movement
<AdamTheDuck> taoumi, were we trying to deliver something? I can't remmeber
<AdamTheDuck> remember*
<taoumi> no i think we were just going on a rampage AdamTheDuck
<SirGanjalf> is he a member of alien bug-people race?
<Gold_Demona> taoumi: That's like asking why the chicken crossed the road.
<Java> why?
<DaringDerpy> sector 1
<taoumi> well it's the truth
<DaringDerpy> sector 10 has the final boss
<taoumi> don't risk it
<taoumi> oh well
<SirGanjalf> What is this? Gamma-ray burst?
<SirGanjalf> hmm... nah, i doubt you could escape that
<taoumi> gota love that ion cannon
<Java> cough
<SirGanjalf> Good guys space pirates
<Java> One Piece?
<Java> in space?
<Gold_Demona> Become king of the space pirates?
<DaringDerpy> panic!
<Java> Gold_Demona: Sounds good to me!
<Canebridge> Why is it my time of sense is always messed up this last week of the year.. I woke up thinking "Yay, Saturday, Ponehs!" :'(
<AdamTheDuck> Choices choices choices
<taoumi> pirate is more profitable ... kinda
<SirGanjalf> Space Engineers!
<SirGanjalf> Need a dispenser on that moon!
<Java> Canebridge: Well, at least you can watch it on youtube
<DaringDerpy> where do you get the cloak ship, taoumi?
<AdamTheDuck> Engi are weird green guys who repair faster than humans
<taoumi> mhmm
<DaringDerpy> engis are squishier than humans
<taoumi> oh um..... no idea
<Canebridge> True Java - I've just grown to love watching it here, with the crazy chat along - Ack well
<DaringDerpy> no
<taoumi> never got it. or rather didn't care to DaringDerpy
<sub06905> and i return :>
<DaringDerpy> oh
<taoumi> don't
<DaringDerpy> ok
<Java> Burn the ship
<Gold_Demona> Where's the giant can of raid?
<SirGanjalf> giant alien spider are srs bsns
<DaringDerpy> didn't know you can win against the spiders
<taoumi> i thinks it's because he has a bug
<DaringDerpy> oh
<Java> badum tish?
<SirGanjalf> yeah, music in this is pretty atmospheric
<SirGanjalf> BTW: Was FTL in HumbleIndieBundle already?
<Java> Weeee are explooooring the spaaaaace and we're going to diiiiieeeeeeee
<AdamTheDuck> SirGanjalf, not that I recall
<taoumi> what am i doing... i should be stuffign vynal
<Java> SirGanjalf: I remember it is for Royal Bundle?
<Gold_Demona> It's dangerous to go alone. Take this.
<taoumi> you need a drone control center. but that will split your scrap even more
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, it's a drone, your ship can't man drones
<SirGanjalf> Java: You may be right, cause i recall it being in some bundle
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, sell it at the next store you meet
<taoumi> i would sugjest min maxing into wepons
<Java> Put Royal, Humble and Indie gala on your quick shortcuts
<Java> wepons :p
<taoumi> fule
<Gold_Demona> Fuelle?
<sub06905> lel
<taoumi> ...n-no.no nooo
<Java> Sumica: FOR JUSTICE! no pirates shall escape my grasp of JUSTIIIIIICCCCCEEEEEE!!!!!
<Java> cough cough
<taoumi> it's caled buying a smartship?
<SirGanjalf> Whose side are you on in this game anyway?
<taoumi> the good side
<Java> Space marine?
<SirGanjalf> the light side?
<taoumi> all your dones
<DaringDerpy> for drones
<AdamTheDuck> Sell them
<taoumi> drones that you don't have a contol for
<DaringDerpy> using a drone costs one drone part
<DaringDerpy> sell them
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, well drone parts are used for drones which you can't use on your ship anyway
<taoumi> more sheilds moar power
<DaringDerpy> you might look out for a cloaking device
<DaringDerpy> drones are overrated
<AdamTheDuck> <3 Drones though LM
<AdamTheDuck> :< *
<DaringDerpy> asteroids are cool when the enemy has weak shields
<Fl00t4sh41> what game is this?
<SirGanjalf> FTL
<AdamTheDuck> Faster Than Light

<pony_436751> hey guys!
<taoumi> engi ship
<Champion_Of_Harmony> what game is this?
<Stopwatch> is it always real time?
<AdamTheDuck> Faster Than Light - FTL
<Champion_Of_Harmony> Ah
<Stopwatch> it's hard for me to concede that something that always runs in real time is a roguelike
<SirGanjalf> i do't know, 40 scraps?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> yesterday... wood got in my foot D:
<SirGanjalf> *don't
<Gaige> hey
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Gaige
<AdamTheDuck> Oh Sumica, you do know there's autofire right?
<AdamTheDuck> You can switch between shots
<AdamTheDuck> like while it recharges
<AdamTheDuck> it just makes it so you won't have to look at how charged your weapons are
<taoumi> some times holding fire is benificial AdamTheDuck
<Gaige> isnt that how you could have got a ship
<Leonid> what is this game name?
<Gaige> FTL faster then light
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm an augment
<taoumi> specialy w/ the ion cannon AdamTheDuck. can wait till it hits and strips the sheilds then fire
<AdamTheDuck> taoumi, true
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> huh didnt know that o.o apparently the VA for Sweetie and Babs are the daughters of the VA of Goku and Vegeta :D kinda funny since Babs was a bully at first then became a friend to the CMC like Vegeta to Goku lol
<Stopwatch> I
<Java> cough
<Stopwatch> just bought this
<Stopwatch> it's only $7.49
<Java> only
<Gaige> this game is unfair as hell
<Stopwatch> how $2?
<Gold_Demona> Sketch_Toku_Brony: To be specific, Sweetie Belle's VA's dad was the voice for the Canadian dub Goku. :P
<Java> bundle perhaps
<Stopwatch> well shit
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Gold_Demona: ah i see :P i read it was a dub just not the nationality :$
<Stopwatch> still $8 not much of a hit
<Gold_Demona> Sketch_Toku_Brony: And I just looked it up, same is true for Babs. Canadian dub Vegeta.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Gold_Demona: huh neat
<Gold_Demona> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Which is my preferred English-speaking Vegeta, personally.
<Stopwatch> is this multiplayer?
<AdamTheDuck> Stopwatch, nope
<Stopwatch> good i actually fucking hate multiplayer
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Gold_Demona: lol now if only we could hear Babs say its over 9000,lol jk
<Stopwatch> lol
<Gold_Demona> Sketch_Toku_Brony: LOL, Yeah. That's the correct Vegeta, too. XD
<Stopwatch> if you guys can't into Toshio Furukawa gtfo
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<Gold_Demona> Stopwatch: Who?
<Stopwatch> i think that was Japan Vegeta
<Gold_Demona> Ah
<Gold_Demona> Only Japanese voice actors I know are the ones in Lupin the Third. lol :D
<Stopwatch> or that might have been piccolo
<Stopwatch> you gotta get into Akira Kamiya and Norio Wakamoto at least
<Stopwatch> you've probably seen something with them
<Noname2> moar power + moar O2 :(
<Gold_Demona> I'm not that big a Dragonball fan. I stopped watching it after they switched to the American voice cast.
<Gold_Demona> Instead of the Canadian one
<aniderp|bestcakeever> people...
<Stopwatch> Horikawa Ryo was Japanese Vegeta
<aniderp|bestcakeever> should i enter the peice in the contest?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> o.O
<Stopwatch> he and Toshio Furukawa both awesome
<Java> cough
<pinkiepoop> S THIS?
<AdamTheDuck> aniderp|bestcakeever, do it. :P No harm can come from submitting it
<pinkiepoop> what game is this?
<AdamTheDuck> FTL
<aniderp|bestcakeever> Gold_Demona: hai :D muffin?
<Stopwatch> does this game come with a manual in the .exe?
<Stopwatch> it looks like it needs one
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Hi! And yes! =D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> -hands muffin-
<Stopwatch> welp gotta go play this bitch now
<Stopwatch> peace everypony

<LightTrooper105> good for you o.o
<Gold_Demona> Rocket: Steam's been doing this since Chrsitmas. :P
<LightTrooper105> Steam.. its like Facebook for gamers..
<Rocket> Gold_Demona i dont look at steam so often ;_;
<Gold_Demona> But they rotate their games around so you have to check back to see which games are for sale.
<LightTrooper105> every day their a sale
<LightTrooper105> and the ocasion flash sale
<Gold_Demona> Rocket: Probably for the better. I throw a lot of money into Steam sales. >.>
<LightTrooper105> it because of steam sale Im broke
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight SuperBrony64|Zzz
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02night :3
<AdamTheDuck> LightTrooper105, http://www.iruntheinternet.com/lulzdump/images/wallet-steam-sale-wat-r-u-doing-stahp-1356634345o.jpg
<LightTrooper105> SuperBrony64|Zzz night
<Rocket> night SuperBrony64|Zzz
<Gold_Demona> I usually check the Steam store every time I turn Steam on.
<LightTrooper105> that is 100% true AdamTheDuck
<Rocket> AdamTheDuck haha :D
<Gold_Demona> More often than not I end up adding stuff to my wishlist, but sometimes something will be on sale that I want.
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: LOL XP
<LightTrooper105> if its on my wishlist or that game I had plan to buy before.. if its on sale its insta buy for me...
<LightTrooper105> which is terrible habit
<Gold_Demona> Same here LightTrooper105
<Rocket> Well i dont buy games on steam, i buy games in shops :{
<Gold_Demona> And yes, that is a terrible habit. >.>
<Etharian> o2 was off
<Gold_Demona> Rocket: I buy on Steam because it means I don't have to leave my house to get the game. :P
<Gold_Demona> Or wait for shipping
<Etharian> *shrugs*
<Dark_Horst> maybe you clicked without noticing
<LightTrooper105> or if you had to uninstall you dont need to worry about the cd key
<Gold_Demona> ^
<AdamTheDuck> ^^
<Dark_Horst> also my grief with this game was is that it's pure gambling
<Rocket> But now all games saving cd kay in steam so :D
<Dark_Horst> whether you win or not has nothing to with skill. jsut luck
<Rocket> its quite annoying that every game now have to be on steam
<LightTrooper105> not all now
<LightTrooper105> eince EA got its own one
<AdamTheDuck> Origin...
<LightTrooper105> indeed..
<AdamTheDuck> What a nightmare
<AdamTheDuck> I had to contact EA support just so I could change my name...
<LightTrooper105> wow....
<Rocket> But most of games moves to steam for example Warband
<LightTrooper105> and most Indie Game goes to steam aswell
<AdamTheDuck> Rocket, it's not like Steam is providing a bad service
<Gold_Demona> I think Steam is convenient.
<Rocket> AdamTheDuck i know but i had to buy Warband again ._.
<LightTrooper105> Steam is indeed convenient
<LightTrooper105> try me buying Company of heroes 3 times
<LightTrooper105> the last one I bought on steam
<AdamTheDuck> Oh did Sumi die?
<Gold_Demona> Rocket: Why'd you have to buy it again? Did you lose the one you had?
<SirGanjalf> Stick isn't perfect but i like to stick to one platform of digital distribution
<pony_676> hello lads !!!
<LightTrooper105> yes..
<AdamTheDuck> I was gone for a bit
<SirGanjalf> *Steam, lol
<taoumi> you were in a nebula....might have been fire?
<Champion_Of_Harmony> is it possible your life support systyms were damaged?
<Etharian> The nebula killed half your power
<taoumi> eww
<Champion_Of_Harmony> huh intresting...
<Rocket> Gold_Demona Well i dunno, it was like they moved Warband to steam and they did new servers and they leaved you with useless game in hand
<Champion_Of_Harmony> now I see why you dont like nebulas
<SirGanjalf> oh i see, electromagnetic charges?
<Gold_Demona> Rocket: That didn't make any sense to me. But maybe it's because I know nothing of Warband, so I don't know how that works. O_o
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: if you click autofire you won't have to reset the target after every burst
<LightTrooper105> lol
<Dark_Horst> missiles. they're epensive, you have few and half the time they friggn miss
<Rocket> Gold_Demona its old game and i have no idea why i couldnt play it more, maybe i had bug
<Dark_Horst> hate em
<Gold_Demona> Rocket: Could just be it was just too old for your system. That happens.
<Rocket> Gold_Demona maybe, i had 4 years old laptop :D
<Gold_Demona> Rocket: In which case you would have to buy a newer one that's more compatible with your system.
<Gold_Demona> Rocket: So that's not Steam's fault. It's the fault of the age of your game. :P
<Gold_Demona> Rocket: Steam did you a favor by having it available on their thingy.
<Dark_Horst> usually if old games get sold on steam, they have been tweaked to work on modern systems
<AdamTheDuck> I really need to play more Warband >.>
<Gold_Demona> Right, what Dark_Horst said
<Rocket> AdamTheDuck d-d-d-d-duel!
<Gold_Demona> GOG.com is a really good site to get some super old games. Only catch is you need to have DOS Box installed on your system, but that's not an issue since it's free.
<Champion_Of_Harmony> This game intrigues me, I am thinking about buying it on steam...but im not sure.
<Dark_Horst> well, you need dos box for every dos gamre
<Champion_Of_Harmony> Fing ad!
<Gold_Demona> Dark_Horst: Yeah, I'm just saying it's a requirement for most games you get on GOG. Because of the fact that they're DOS-based games.
<Chrysalis> 'sup guys
<Rocket> AdamTheDuck i remember when i played it long ago, i was in clan :D 20 people, this was really funny
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Chrysalis
<Rocket> ohai Chrysalis
<Chrysalis> oooh FTL
<AdamTheDuck> Rocket, I bought it for Mount and Musket really but I never took the time to fully learn how to play the game
<Dark_Horst> i have warband too
<Chrysalis> picked this up in the sales, any good
<Dark_Horst> you guys really need the crpg mod
<Dark_Horst> you really do
<Champion_Of_Harmony> whats that red stuff that looks like its going to engulf the system?
<Rocket> Dark_Horst i played crpg
<Chrysalis> Dark_Horst: whats it do?
<Champion_Of_Harmony> its that cloaking!
<AdamTheDuck> Rocket, "that adds persistent character leveling and to player-vs-player combat. "
<Rocket> best in warband are mods for me
<Dark_Horst> Chrysalis: it makes the multiplayer actually interesting
<Rocket> Chrysalis it adds football mod
<Dark_Horst> crpg works with the browser. ingame you earn money and exp which you can then spend on their homepage to buy new weapons and armor for your character. you also level up
<LightTrooper105> I just like to play the Warband napoleoni
<Dark_Horst> and use skillpoints and stuff
<aniderp|bestcakeever> -sigh-
<AdamTheDuck> What's wrong aniderp?
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Champion_Of_Harmony> ah hell

<AdamTheDuck> Fight yourself? How does once go about doing that?

<Gold_Demona> Crying is healthy
<LightTrooper105> its best to let it out then keeping it

<NekoC> I think so Brain, but...
<Dark92Enigma> NARF
<Sumica> 00,10it's coppyed from Twi's birthday dance
<Kandarihu> Ah, at the time I thought it was Wrek, but I looked him up on the Steam Community and it's been 31 hours since he's been on.
<Simon> Cocaine!
<Sumica> 00,10portable party cannon
<Dark92Enigma> FIRE!
<Dark92Enigma> I WAS FROZEN TODAY
<Kandarihu> The Steam Store is down.
<NekoC> I think so Brain, but...
<NekoC> ZOOT
<Dark92Enigma> :D
<Sumica> 00,10dem drums
<Dark92Enigma> So random
<Simon> Sumica: Just wondering, do you like racing games?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<aniderp|bestcakeever> yay

<aniderp|bestcakeever> splat
<Sumica> 00,10dated humor
<Dark92Enigma> I REGRET Nothiiiiiiiiiiiiing
<Kandarihu> I notice that the logic this goes by that "super smart means the rational left hemisphere of the brain is dominant" while "likable idiocy means the emotional right hemisphere is dominant"
<Kandarihu> And this also applies to GLaDOS and Wheatley from Portal 2.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> dat laugh
<Sumica> 00,10big mountain
<Percy> Quite, Pinkie is not really an idiot, he just has no self control and poor logic skills.
<NekoC> Birds have teeth?
<Percy> Brains lack of self control only manifests in his inability to physically abuse Pinky'
<Kandarihu> Even though one of them is an AI based on a human brain-map, and the other one was an AI... with no basis other than a goal.
<Simon> Turkey!
<Simon> And more cocaine!
<Percy> Wow, he remembered it!
<Phase4> http://derpy.me/5ao3t steam sales
<Dark92Enigma> LOL, The Animaniacs made a cameo......again, no big surprise
<Dark92Enigma> WE WERE FROZEN TODAY
<LightTrooper105> Phase4 100% true
<Sumica> 00,10nice Phase4
<Simon> Wallet: You're buying games wrong

<Kandarihu> LOL, Phase4.

<Dark92Enigma> Sumica: yeah......:$ i'm like 30 seconds behind
<Simon> This episode is worth 5000 bucks?
<Percy> And a second later, a Trip to Tahiti.

<Sumica> 00,10and now one of the best eps
<Percy> Ooooh, which one?
<Dark92Enigma> don't you mean........?
<Sumica> 00,10poka dot?
<Dark92Enigma> :O
<Simon> Sumica: Just wondering again, how much total space does your Pc have?

<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Kandarihu> Come to think of it, I think I remember never liking the first few episodes of this... maybe just the very first one.
<Percy> YES!
<alexxm> anvils are best thing
<Sumica> 00,10great songs in this one
<Simon> I saw that one coming

<Simon> But it sounds like he doesn't give a shit
<Percy> Yup. Taking it well.
<Kandarihu> Those are some resonant anvils.
<Sumica> 00,10best anvils in the world

<Simon> Percy: *tss
<Dark92Enigma> MY SIDES
<Dark92Enigma> they're gone
<Simon> Oh geez
<NightSide15> im so confused
<Simon> What does "push-over" mean?
<Sumica> 00,10humanise pinkie and brain
<Percy> Animaniacs is about 75% random humor, and that might be a tad generous.
<Dark92Enigma> :D
<Dark92Enigma> Simon: someone extremely weak
<NekoC> @Sumica I could probably do that... but I'm very lazy
<Sumica> 00,10no i ment the bad guys

<Kandarihu> I've been having trouble identifying the continuity of this series, at least as of the first season. And for one episode of Season 2 to be part 2 of a non-produced part 1 doesn't make things any easier.

<GilDash> Poor Megas...
<Rocket> how did they even tied this fat guy up there ?
<Kandarihu> Rocket, by his wrists iirc
<J_E_Smith71> Well the glitch with the timer I had on this laptop finally stopped. The entire time I've been at my families' house and using this laptop I always had the timer "One Bad Apple 35 Days Ago" when I loaded my theater bookmarked (Which was the last episode I watched on this laptop). Now it's gone and I have no dates present
<Rocket> just wondering
<Sumica> 00,10J_E_Smith71 because no timers have been set
<Sumica> 00,10we only could go up to new year
<Fl00t4sh41> !cd
<Tom> Episode 11 of season 3 "Keep Calm and Flutter On" airs in 19 days, 22 hours, 4 minutes, 50 seconds (Jan 19 15:30:00 2013 UTC)
<Deacon> wait, that;s next?
<alexxm> so when are the timers being updated?
<Braviary> Three weeks until new poni. :(
<Sumica> 00,10when the new year starts
<GilDash> Oooh, Kiva rant time.
<Simon> Sumica: Which time zone?
<Kandarihu> Oh, that sounded like a funny glitch.
<Fl00t4sh41> Almost as cheesy as Coops sandwhich
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: I know the No Dates isn't a glitch I was just mentioning I had the timer stuck on No Bad Apple on this laptop all week
<Deacon> Braviary you can handle it, you've handled 3 1/2 months of no ponies ;)
<J_E_Smith71> Form Blazing Sword
<Braviary> Barely.
<Sumica> 00,10probably est cause that's the time zone the site uses
<pyrocatboy> The button said "That cool energy sword thing" XD
<GilDash> pyrocatboy: That dashboard has new controls every single episode, pretty much.
<Sumica> 00,10sound in space
<DerpyMuffins> HAha
<Fl00t4sh41> GilDash: Thats because coop is constantly adding features
<DerpyMuffins> The physics is so bad
<Deacon> the dashboard is like castlevania, a being of chaos
<NullRadix> La Cucaracha > Laws of physics
<Sumica> 00,10"totqaly not the same button coop pressed before"
<GilDash> Fl00t4sh41: I know, but it's made funnier by the fact what was there before is replaced. XD
<Rocket> looks like dead space
<GilDash> Oh shut up and explode already...
<Fl00t4sh41> Poor captain Harlock
<NullRadix> Context sensitive buttons are best buttons

<Cosmic> That's the BEST.
<Jmo> Pfft.
<Jmo> There is only one LC.
*Jmo slaps BaconMane around a bit with a large trout
<Rustyheadphones> Also, he has the color scheme of Wario

<jcelios> cachi01|phone: yes
<Sumica> 00,10there is no overkill. there is only open fire and I have to reload.
<J_E_Smith71> Should have fired your overkill
<CriticKitten> Needs more
<Cosmic> Lololololol
<J_E_Smith71> Ehh close enough
<Simon> Ohhhhh
<Fl00t4sh41> Should have used more overkill
<Simon> Wabam
<Nyst> Sumica: Schlock?
<Sumica> 00,10wut?
<Simon> Inb4 more serious shit
<DerpyMuffins> Mexican stand off
<Nyst> That quote; it's from Schlock Mercenary no?
<Sumica> 00,10throwing up the horns
<CriticKitten> DANG
<Sumica> 00,10never heard of it
<Simon> Oh shit
<Rustyheadphones> lol
<Cosmic> Not quite a Mexican Standoff because they're both firing.
<jcelios> wait is he a robot inside a mech? :P
<Dark_Horst> yep
<Fl00t4sh41> Not the Conveniently Placed Oil Refinery!
<Simon> jcelios: You calling it robotception?
<Java> Let us build an oil refinary here!
<Braviary> inb4 it actually does things.
<CriticKitten> Dat magic
<Dark_Horst> yoink
<J_E_Smith71> You could have done that the whole time?
<Kandarihu> If only the screen on Skalgar's robot changed to channel 28 as well.
<Rustyheadphones> Nope
<Cosmic> Dude, the fuck.
<Cosmic> So many buildings.
<Java> There goes New Jersey
<DerpyMuffins> Who cares it's New Jersey
<Java> again
<jcelios> and nothing of value was lost
<Fl00t4sh41> Cosmic: Its only New Jersey. Nothing of value is lost
<Cosmic> xD
<J_E_Smith71> And they just stand there and watch the Test Pattern
<Deacon> I know your pain prisoners
<Sumica> 00,10rant
<jcelios> b4 internet
<Rustyheadphones> Destroy ALL the City
<CriticKitten> Suddenly dat guitar
<Cosmic> I love how this is legal.
<Rocket> ofc there was no people in buildings?
<J_E_Smith71> I think DVD-R will be Coop's best friend in the future
<Dark_Horst> maser refracor?
<Fl00t4sh41> maser protons?
<J_E_Smith71> Wonder if he rigs Megas to have Wi-Fi in the future
<Simon> Fail
<Sumica> 00,10why do we have a gun
<Sumica> 00,10that gives enemys a shield
<Dark_Horst> i think it's a play on meson
<Fl00t4sh41> Sumica: Could use it on an ally
<Kandarihu> He should just install his entertainment center in MEGAS
<Simon> Inb4 he gets defeated again
<BaconMane> 0,5I am LC #1
<Rocket> just give him some electrons?
<Simon> Such predictable storylines
<DerpyMuffins> Mexican standoff
<Sumica> 00,10the secondary bridge has alot of it Kandarihu
<jcelios> Dark_Horst: nah masers are an actualy thing, not realated to mesons
*BaconMane wears his #1 soda drinking hat.
<Cosmic> I'MMA FIRIN' MA LAZOR
<Dark_Horst> hm
<Jmo> Yes, yes you are.
*Jmo slaps BaconMane around a bit with a large trout
<Sumica> 00,10macross time
<CriticKitten> o.o
<Dark_Horst> suddenly GUN
<Rocket> seems legit
<Fl00t4sh41> Dakkka time
<Rustyheadphones> overkill much?
*BaconMane slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<Kandarihu> Sumica, Kiva knew about it. It was probably added to MEGAS by the Earth Military in the distant future. And Coop discovered it and mistook it for a weapon.
<DerpyMuffins> Oh no, Jersey
<Simon> A heavy nuclear bomb
<Cosmic> Lmfao.
<Sumica> 00,10big badda boom
<CriticKitten> And that's why Jersey is such a shithole
<J_E_Smith71> New Jersey destroyed, world a much better place
<Fl00t4sh41> DerpyMuffins: Do you really care about Jersey being nuked?
<penguin> really no ones going to say it?
<penguin> fiiiiine....
<DerpyMuffins> You can't read sarcasm can you?
<penguin> boobies
<Rocket> give him electrons ....
<CriticKitten> Rant?

<DerpyMuffins> Oh no, Jersey again
<Braviary> Meh, it's Jersey.
<Rocket> i like this sho already
<Dark_Horst> encore
<Rustyheadphones> poor new Jersey
<Waz> another day in New Jersey
<Simon> That shit is indestructable
<pyrocatboy> And nothing of value was lost.
<Kandarihu> Yeah, that explosion looks large enough to affect New York City.
<Malavolent> alexxm: Pretty good, I'm spending all my holiday relaxing so far.
<J_E_Smith71> Eh what's one more big city destroying explosion on this show?
<Cosmic> Reversed the polarity of the neutron flow?
<Waz> apparently xD
<jcelios> Cosmic: Anti-neutron flow!
<Simon> Oh shit
<Cosmic> :D
<Braviary> Ded.
<J_E_Smith71> And the remote gets trashed
<CriticKitten> lol
<Fl00t4sh41> That was anticlimactic

<Cosmic> They smuggled him into the drive-in movie
<GilDash> Never fail to laugh. Ever.
<Fl00t4sh41> Simon: Goat
<Waz> Wendee Lee is in this?
<Cosmic> And forgot about him in all the fighting.
<Dark_Horst> the junkyard guy?
<SlenderManWoods> its the trunk monster
<Kandarihu> Simon, Goat, the owner of the junkyard where Coop found MEGAS.
<J_E_Smith71> And Goat died the end
<Deacon> Kandarihu and sold for $2

<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Spotlight Music: Chasing the Wind / Little Miss Rarity / Aloe & Lotus
<GilDash> aniderp|bestcakeever: Better question: Why are you wearing them?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i wanna steal my ex's boxers o.O
<Fl00t4sh41> aniderp|bestcakeever: The real question is why you are telling strangers on the internet about stealing your brothers boxer-briefs
<aniderp|bestcakeever> idk...
<Sumica> 00,10and yes that is prime
<GilDash> aniderp|bestcakeever: Slow day, eh?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> boxers are comfy and i thought they were boxers o.O
<jcelios> lol
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but they boxer breifs
<Dark_Horst> wait... cullen?
<Braviary> Robo-room 101?
<Fl00t4sh41> Dat Prisoner reference
<penguin> kill prime
<Waz> and here is your clockwork isnt?
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<CriticKitten> That's a really impractical switch.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but if i took my ex's boxers... i would have to wash them twice
<Sumica> 00,10but it looks cool
<aniderp|bestcakeever> and i doubt they would fit me o.O
<penguin> nooo number 34353532 you were such a good robot
<J_E_Smith71> That won't work on Megas, considering it has no AI
<jcelios> megas ain't an AI :[
<Simon> jcelios: Unfortunately they can't tell
<Waz> hmmm dude you're messing with human brains now.... how does the program works in this case?
<jcelios> Waz: electricution\
<Waz> it doesnt XD
<Sumica> 00,10*facepalm*
<DerpyMuffins> lol
<CriticKitten> XD
<Waz> what Coop said xD
<Java> hahahahahah
<Fl00t4sh41> Best comeback ever
<penguin> AI pyshics: how do you work
<J_E_Smith71> Maybe you should get out of it and show them it's a human piolted craft
<GilDash> No, I think Coop was right.
<CriticKitten> Intelligence Undetected.
<Java> lol
<Java> Intelligent undetected... including Kiva?
<penguin> so.... robot rape time?
<Braviary> They always try to kill the person rather than letting them go, tsk tsk.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> guys i think im gonna order these
<aniderp|bestcakeever> http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/Apparel/UndiesBras/Undies//My+Little+Pony+Yay+Muffins+Hot+Pants+3+Pack-171988.jsp
<Fl00t4sh41> Java: Who is the real idiot. The idiot, or the one who follows him?
<Waz> if she was smart she would have taken Megas back home LOOOOOOOONG ago
<Java> Fl00t4sh41: Well..... yeah
<penguin> aniderp|bestcakeever: ok. good for you
<jcelios> the fluttershy one is funny XD
<Sumica> 00,10wait they make those?
<CriticKitten> Jumpy-starty.
<Fl00t4sh41> Quick and painless
<Java> they kill gundam! you bastard!
<Dark_Horst> dont you just love cartoon death^^
<Sumica> 00,10power saw
<Waz> groovy
<penguin> bumble bee will save the day
<penguin> just wait
<Fl00t4sh41> Java: Gundams are all shit anyway
<jcelios> Megas > Gundams
<Java> Fl00t4sh41: Now you take that words back sonny
<Sumica> 00,10and he sticks the landing
<Kandarihu> Hmm, this show is 99% episodic. If this were adapted into a Super Robot Wars game, the writing would have to change into a full-on-continuity, fusing it with other mecha franchises that take itself at least a little bit more seriously, and the jokes about the malfunctions would be a lot harder to portray.
<Fl00t4sh41> Java: Nope. Gundam Seed and Destiny ruined the whole franchise
<Simon> Inb4 it doesn't hurt
<Java> Fl00t4sh41: You based the whole franchise on Seed series? avoid those crap and enjoy better ones.
<Simon> More slide shows
<Sumica> 00,10ohmy
<Fl00t4sh41> Java: Because Gundam Wing and Gundam X where such massive improvements
<Waz> oh. dear.... wait... wut?
<jcelios> no not MTV!
<Lyra`> unf
<Rose`> im byack :3
<Rose`> and is this transformers?
<Braviary1> No, jcelios, it's Poop TV on this show.
<Java> Fl00t4sh41: yes. It's an improvement.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> guys
<Fl00t4sh41> Java: But still shit
<aniderp|bestcakeever> http://www.cafepress.com/+derpy_hooves_boxers,557530005
<aniderp|bestcakeever> the derpy boxers look like that
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im not sure if i want..
<Java> Fl00t4sh41: Nope, not shit
<Sumica> 00,10the thong looks better
<Kandarihu> Hating on Gundam because of SEED while watching MEGAS XLR is like hating on all of Star Wars based on the prequels while watching Spaceballs.
<Rose`> 202! <3
<Java> Is that purple guy supposed to be Zentraedi expy?
<Rose`> 101! <3
<Braviary1> Spicy ham nuggets.
<Fl00t4sh41> Kandarihu: Point
<penguin> gameoner
<Dark_Horst> they male derpy thongs?

<Kandarihu> Java, I don't see any Macross references i this.
<jcelios> Kandarihu: X
<penguin> gaverover*
<jcelios> Kandarihu: XD
<Waz> well... that failed
<Dark_Horst> i can hear you guys thinking up remarks to that typo
<Java> Kandarihu: the purple guy? "lesser intelligence being" stuff?
<penguin> no the flowers nooooo
<Fl00t4sh41> Kandarihu: I'm more of a battletech/patlabor/ghost in the shell kind of guy
<GilDash> La-la-laaaa!
<Dark_Horst> evil
<Fl00t4sh41> I prefer my robots with just a hint of realism
<Fl00t4sh41> Not a lot, just a little
<Nyst> The alien sounds like Optimus Prime.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but.. the thongs are for the girls right? o.O
<Simon> What? No Konami code?
<Waz> then stay the fork away from Gurren Lagann :P
<Uboa-San> Seems like a Konami Code to Me
<jcelios> aniderp|bestcakeever: they are for whoever can rock 'em!
<Dark_Horst> Fl00t4sh41: which kicks gundams out of te contest and leaves pretty much only mechwarrior
<penguin> up down triangle... damn
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but thing is i need to know about the thong so i can order right size if i do get it o.O
<Fl00t4sh41> Dark_Horst: Which is why I dislike gundam
<Waz> well done Coop...
<Champion_of_Harmony> turns out it was a prison for evil robots
<Sumica> 00,10cruse control, cruse out of control
<Fl00t4sh41> Dark_Horst: that and the facepalminglly bad writing the series is rife with
<J_E_Smith71> Then it turns out Coop screwed over the universe
<Dark_Horst> what DID he build?
<Waz> ...you freed a whole bunch on convicts
<Kandarihu> Cruisin' USA
<GilDash> 'Cruise Out of Control'? XD
<Java> Tom Cruise control
<penguin> bitches love world savers
<J_E_Smith71> Bet they were deadly convicts
<J_E_Smith71> Yep
<Dark_Horst> ah crap
<Sumica> 00,10Jammie just likes to watch the universe burn
<Dark_Horst> jamie's one of those people, eh?
<Braviary1> Lalalalalaaa.
<pyrocatboy> dat cruise OUT of control button.
<alexxm> i was right
<Fl00t4sh41> Gurren Laggan gets a pass by actually being funny and entertaing
<SpeccyRush> ohey that's Cam Clarke
<penguin> well...
<penguin> shit
<J_E_Smith71> DUN DUN DUN
<GilDash> I'm almost surprised.
<Braviary1> Lalalaaa.

<Java> define "a couple"
<Champion_of_Harmony> our entire existance is nothing but fighting!
<penguin> we have had thousands of battles and have killed millions
<Fl00t4sh41> Java: Equestria wouldn't have an army if they didn't get into fights themselves

<Lil_B> well, gonna open my last Malzbier :(
<AttackWithHugs> Hi Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01question: if we asked for donations, how many of you would donate, and how much would you donate? (realisitically, please)
<Panda> Sudden yellow appears.
<pot80> Heyaayaayaa saturn whats going on?
<GilDash> Saturn: What is it for?
<Vordox> This is ....rulewise Dan :D
<Wrek> 05server costs
<Saturn> 08,01for server upkeep on bronystate
<Wrek> 05keepign the site polished
<MLP_Brovakiin> rdibp: He clearly said knock it off :I
<Wrek> 05etc
<Tie> If I had money... about $10
<penguin> pitching license
<Java> Actually Dan fit perfectly in Baseball....
<Saturn> 08,01it costs us $60/year for hosting, etc.
<jcelios> Saturn: I'd donate, about 10$ probably
<Rustyheadphones> hm... about 20$
<pot80> Depends if it were an internet ad it would probably be a scam
<Vordox> I would give about....50 a year?
<GilDash> I'm surprised it's that low, to be honest. :S
<Simon> Probably 5 bucks
<rdibp> MLP_Brovakiin: i though i said it. :T
<Panda> Saturn, hm... I really dont know.
<GilDash> Consdiering I'm on it almost ever day, I'd feel bad not donating anything...
<MilkyWhiskers00> LOL
<MilkyWhiskers00> AHAHAHAHA
<Barbetos> wait we can donate all of a sudden now?
<Barbetos> I have been barking up that tree being told no.
<pot80> :D Genious
<Sumica> 00,10it's being thought about Barbetos
<MilkyWhiskers00> Boom
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: "Spike at your Service": Episode Followup
<rdibp> i love these
<MilkyWhiskers00> LOL
<Barbetos> Aight. well let me know. I would love to help
<J_E_Smith71> Saturn: Not sure, but given the amount ofcash this fandom throws at stuff maybe someone can regularly throw a wad of cash
<MilkyWhiskers00> I sleep on a big pile of muuneeh!
<Barbetos> MilkyWhiskers00 Okay Mr. Crabs
<J_E_Smith71> Dan better stay away from Disney World then
<Saturn> 08,01would it be more reasonable for us to offer commissions from our artists, rather than ask for donations?
<Sumica> 00,10BUNS!
<MilkyWhiskers00> Barbetos: It was in the show - .-
<Vordox> Lawl dat imunity
<Java> hahahahaha
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<Tie> Saturn: Yeah, actually
<Lil_B> xD
<Saturn> 08,01like $15 for a sketch from wrek
<Wrek> 05ahem
<MilkyWhiskers00> MACED
<Wrek> 05im more expensive than that boy
<Sumica> 00,10might want to ask wrek first Saturn
<MilkyWhiskers00> AHAHAHAHHA
<GilDash> Saturn: That sounds like it would be a good idea. You know, if Wrek agreed, you muppet. :p
<MilkyWhiskers00> DAT KIDNAPP!
<Saturn> 08,01i'm just floating the idea!
<Barbetos> lol
<Saturn> 08,01it was an example
<Tie> Wrek: could be just a quick draw...
<MilkyWhiskers00> Monkeyface tape his arms!
<MilkyWhiskers00> Lol
<Barbetos> Might want to talk about this on skype? =X
<Panda> 15 bucks for a sketch?
<Tie> Duct tape fixes everything
<MilkyWhiskers00> Me too buddy
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: i can name some things you'd do fro free.
<Barbetos> Some one may be a dick about it if you throw numbers around here, and change them later.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Saturn: I would still donate, picture or not :p
<jcelios> ^
<Vordox> ^^
<Wrek> 05cause i want to do them
<penguin> monkey face will be jail bait. just like luna
<Wrek> 05if i gotta follow someones prerequisites
<Saturn> 08,01okay, who thinks it should be the mods' responsibility to contribbute to the server costs?
<Vordox> Not me
<Vordox> We're a group
<Vordox> We live by group
<MLP_Brovakiin> Nah, we all use it, it is a shared effort :)
<Vordox> We fight for group
<Barbetos> Welllllll...
<jcelios> they already donate time and effort moderating imo
<Barbetos> It is privately owned
<Lil_B> Saturn if it's really just 60$/year than I think that that goal would be reached with just donations, I mean just looking at the numbers people just posted well exceeded 60$
<Saturn> 08,01oh cool, we have an army
<DerpyMuffins> All for one Saturn
<MilkyWhiskers00> Deef trawp
<MilkyWhiskers00> WAit
<Java> I want a hot dog now.
<Barbetos> Just make sure no one can throw this place under the bus by making it "everyones"
<MilkyWhiskers00> DEATH TRAP!
<SlenderManWoods> i am hungry now
<Barbetos> I want to contribute, but i want the mods in controll
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: i'm not sure how many would *actually* donate if we did it, though
<SlenderManWoods> i want hot dogs
<Wrek> 05donatiosn would fund server costs keepign the site polished and my cigarretes
<Barbetos> Cuase you guys seem to knwo what your doing, and care to od the right thing.
<Bronysith> Wrek: hooray for smokes
<Spyrofan001> 6So whats up?
<DerpyMuffins> I would pay for Wrek smokes
<Barbetos> Ima donate cigars to the wrek fund now.
<GilDash> Saturn: Oi, you guys do enough just hosting it.
<Java> Well, the idea for paid art commission sounds good.
<Barbetos> Cigars makes brandy, coffee, whiskey, soda...
<MilkyWhiskers00> Water proof
<Saturn> 08,01our current webhost is not the cheapest, but they do give us the best terms, w.r.t. DMCA
<GilDash> Better idea: Make Bronystate Gold a reality. XD
<Barbetos> All those things taste amazing after a cigar.
<MilkyWhiskers00> Lol
<MilkyWhiskers00> Dat
<MilkyWhiskers00> Fight
<Saturn> 08,01so if we get a DMCA notice from Hasbro, they can get stuck at our webhost
<Barbetos> I already have bronystate gold, I can see what you said GilDash XD
<Vordox> as I said, Saturn I'm ready to puff up donations just to keep this server going
<Saturn> 08,01or from UMG, or anyone
<thebikergorilla> This show has a disturbing lack of Scootaloo:[

<Afflict> wine glass
<Kandarihu> Vordox, I don't think it would cause a paradox. I don't think I should be describing what would happen in this case... not if I want to keep this civil.
<Afflict> sort of
<Lil_B> I think Air didn't have Lyrics :P
<KnightLunaire> that shinji has a terrible voice actor oO

<Sumica> 00,10yeah but subs are hard to follow and chat at same time
<Bronysith> Shizuka: other than that, is it pretty good?
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: Maybe they make the members pay for it at the NerV bookstore, gotta fund it somehow
<Rocket> Sumica what is this film called ?
<penguin> derpy
<pot80> penguin: I guess everything produces a sound but as singing is classed as produced by a living organism an inanimate object cannot unless personnified in description?
<Tie> dat flank
<Simon> Damn that sexy
<Bronysith> Rocket: evangelion rebuilds 1.11
<Sumica> 00,10rebuild of eva: 1.11 you are (not) alone

<Gekoncze> 13thx ^^
<Simon> Why does hurting the machine also hurt the person controlling it?
<pot80> penguin: but they are created in a personnified manner so all it does is back up my argument
<Rocket> so wait, they will put gozilla VS gozilla ?
<MadSurge> Sumica: Ikr
<Vordox> Sumica: We got to start from SSSOMEWHERE
<jcelios> Simon: I'm guessing... psychic link?

<ThunderBreeze> What's that anime?
<Bronysith> 1 thing i like better in the original anime is when the eva lifts its hand over shinji from the falling rocks
<pot80> penguin: that has nothing to do with how inanimate objects can sing when presented in a personnified manner though which is what we were talking about
<Verdant_Wasp> its just a giant alien monster
<Verdant_Wasp> now thats the spirit
<thebikergorilla> Have you accepted Scootaloo as your personal lord and savior
<Sumica> 00,10needs more thuderbirds are go music
<Nyst> I'm sure he's in the perfect mental state to fight.
<penguin> pot80: it has everything to do with "fox and the hound" that was a great movie

<Bronysith> Kandarihu: false, it is mistress sexy

<Vordox> <--- How to introduce a character. :D
<Shizuka> 13no but the preview of it

<Barbetos> adults seem to have the worst plans ever in this anmie
<Stormy> I went out with my sister and best friend last night for kind of a bachelorette party

<Stormy> staying far, far away from that
<Everto> Oh my god yea, that's exactly what I got
<Sumica> 00,10eyes on the road misato
<Stormy> I would be even more afraid of r/apple and r/android
<Stormy> haha
<Vordox> Sumica: Yeah it's a heavy traffic
<Everto> Actually /r/apple and /r/android are not that bad
<Sumica> 00,10the road curves
<pot80> you gotta belieeeeeve
<Stormy> really?
<Barbetos> Every time shinji says anything I become more of an angry person
<Sumica> 00,10and well that

<Everto> It's /r/technology that you need to watch out for
<Sundaysmile> LOL

<Panda> You've got the BELIEVE.
<Stormy> I would think they'd both be extremely circlejerky
<Shizuka> 13useless angel is go
<Sundaysmile> Does he NEED to repeat that????
<Everto> Yea, /r/apple and /r/android are actually void of most fanboys
<Sumica> 00,10better then the undersea one Shizuka
<Verdant_Wasp> talk about heavy traffic
<Bronysith> inb4 shizu arrivfes
<Stormy> hmm
<Shizuka> 13i mean really the angels show they learn from previous failures, wtf is this one supposed to accomplish
<Stormy> interesting
<Sundaysmile> wat
<KnightLunaire> this thing looks even more stupid
<Shizuka> 13okay it does that
<Panda> Well, it made things explode.
<Sundaysmile> it was reincarnated into a crappy jesus clock
<Shizuka> 13release the shizu~
<Everto> /r/apple is filled with mostly tips and tricks on Macs and iOS devices
<AdamTheDuck> Asuka \:3/
<KnightLunaire> asuka to the rescue
<Sumica> 00,10cool gun is cool
<Stormy> probably the friendliest subreddit ever is /r/mylittlepony
<Barbetos> you forgot your gun
<Verdant_Wasp> Asuka!!!
<Buytoast> so why is the ocean filled with red drink anyways?
<Bronysith> oh hai Shizuka you going to kick some angel ass?
<Stormy> But no one is interested in that :P
<Barbetos> Sunddy Just Cause 2 eva unit
<Everto> How to jailbreak, mods, consumer advice, etc.
<Panda> So... is asuka still hormonal in this one?
<Vordox> <--- Who piloting that?
<Rustyheadphones> uhm, why's the sea red?
<KnightLunaire> crush it with your constant menstruation powers
<Sundaysmile> so many tentacles.....
<pot80> Now this is what I'm talkin about
<Everto> While /r/android is the same thing, except with android.
<Vordox> Obligatoru Guitar
<Shizuka> 13still a pointless angel
<Verdant_Wasp> still cant touch that
<Sundaysmile> shoot the glowing testicle maybe?
<Everto> Most people in them seem to recognize that the devices are suited for people differently, and they leave it at that.
<Sumica> 00,10izuma kicka
<AdamTheDuck> Shizuka, ikr
<Vordox> Kicking an Angel...?
<Spyrorocks> Stormy, it is the only subreddit void of random arguments over nothing
<Stormy> that's good
<Rocket> Shizuka but now in 3d!
<Barbetos> looks kind of painful
<Panda> Yes, do flips in the air for speed and power.
<Dark92Enigma-> ROUNDHOUSE KICK
<Shizuka> 13momentum
<Dark_Horst> yeah, put that core in the line of fire, for all to see
<Shizuka> 13how does it work
<Stormy> I never thought I'd see that kind of maturity from reddit
<Dark_Horst> 360 degree attack angle
<pot80> awesome sauce
<Dark92Enigma-> SPLOOOOOOOOOOGE
<Sundaysmile> LMAO
<Barbetos> damn. Strong jets
<Vordox> And ded
<Shizuka> 13what
<Vordox> nice one Asuka
<Dark92Enigma-> OH myyyyyyyyyyyy
<Barbetos> Did shinji die?
<Invi> so, that was fast
<Stormy> Spyrorocks, I've seen some pretty stupid arguments there
<Barbetos> please tell me he died
<Stormy> But they never get very heated
<Kandarihu> Barbetos, sorry.
<Sundaysmile> no shinji didn't die
<Barbetos> nuuuuuuuuuhh!1
<Sundaysmile> but he needs new shorts
<Vordox> Shizuka: "Son of a bitch, GRRRR!"
<Everto> I would think
<KnightLunaire> these girls kick enough ass, why do they need shinji at all
<Shizuka> 13it's also not the only thing that's red
<Dark92Enigma-> ohpleasetellmehe'sded-noooooo
<Panda> Eww.... red.
<Everto> /r/trees is the least arguing
<Dark92Enigma-> ASUKA <3
<Spyrorocks> Hell, people even post their shitty artwork there, and they don't get chewed out.
<Everto> They're too high to argue
<Sundaysmile> red wunz go fasta
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/2K2Xw Shizuka has arrived
<Barbetos> Its true. I did not believe it, but Asuka does make this so much better.
<Verdant_Wasp> asuka rocks
<Stormy> like today I saw one where people were arguing if the new animation style (which I never even noticed) was a sign of declining quality in the show
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/HPh7e hello asuka
<Verdant_Wasp> she has the best death in the first movie
<Dark92Enigma-> YES HE'S STUPID
<Spyrorocks> You mean like the odd angles?
<Vordox> I do not like Asuka
<Buytoast> goddamn i hate this bitch
<Stormy> Yeah
<Vordox> She's too perky
<jcelios> please forgive me mistress :<
<ekips> Vordox nobody does
<Stormy> I saw some screenshots and I agree they look pretty odd
<Bronysith> ekips: Shizuka loves her
<DerpyMuffins> Asuka is a bitch
<Stormy> but I don't really notice that while I'm watching the show
<Panda> ^
<Dark92Enigma-> I would never hide behind my daddy in front of you
<ekips> Shizuka is...an exception
<Rocket> "We are just undestructable angels but we showing this red thing just waiting you to destroy it"
<Stormy> And people were saying the show is dying because of that
<Everto> srsly?
<Spyrorocks> Its not something that concerns me.
<jcelios> I need an adult!
<Barbetos> everyone hits on shinji
<Barbetos> EVERYONE
<Stormy> Yeah, the MLP fandom gets worked up over silly things
<Spyrorocks> speaking of which mlp is on in 4 minutes...
<Barbetos> No wonder his father hates him
<Sundaysmile> even the angels
<DerpyMuffins> Shinji gets all the bitches
<Sumica> 00,10shinji is a tri sexual.
<Saturn> 08,01btw, i've found the BEST cover of Paint It Black
<Panda> O_o tri sexual?
<Verdant_Wasp> well geometry did a pretty decent job
<Sumica> 00,10evey one wants to try dat ass
<Stormy> It's like they think every little bad thing is going to destroy the show
<Barbetos> XD
<Bronysith> Saturn: PM it to me plz
<Sundaysmile> he's omnipisexual
<Shizuka> 13it's marcellus wallace's briefcase
<Dark92Enigma-> Sumica: WHAT'S THE THIRD SEX THEN? :D Hermaphrodite?
<Barbetos> i put my drink down just in time Mica =P
<Vordox> Saturn: One of my favourite songs <3
<Panda> you mean omni-sexual, Sundaysmile.
<Sumica> 00,10they stole morphious's ship?
<Sundaysmile> no
<Everto> Okay
<Dark_Horst> damn thieves
<Spyrorocks> My biggest concern is if that screenshot of that person who says she works on the show is correct, where they are going to have twi go full alicorn and stay that way and continue the series like that.
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: listen to the Tyep O Negative cover
<Vordox> Sexual Tension go
<Panda> Dat grope.

<KnightLunaire> oh mai
<Vordox> Jurassic Park? O.o
<DerpyMuffins> Old times is a threesome
<Bronysith> i need to cosplay as ryoji

<Vordox> Gendou on moon?
<Vordox> WAIT WHAT
<Vordox> THAT TAKES HALF A YEAR TO GO THERE
<Vordox> O.o

<Vordox> Well...

<MadSurge> Vordox: TEL'POR'
<Verdant_Wasp> yea, person in space
<Spyrorocks> they did 13 because kids like reruns so they could spend less money on new content.

<jcelios> is the water red because of second impact?

<Saturn> 08,01so, who here agrees with me that Matt Bellamy = sploosh?
<Stormy> it was a continuous story
<Shizuka> 13jcelios: lots and lots and lots of blood
<Kencolt> Ever seen "The Andromeda Strain"?
<Spyrorocks> mlp isn't a continuous story, but it ties in past events.
