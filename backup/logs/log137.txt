<Xerion> i see ya
<Edward_Newgate> And I would follow him to the depths of hell, even if just to put a tack on the Devil's throne
<prince-dari> Discord = The Joker
<Fluttershy`> 08,1prince-dari seems like mibbit is experiencing lots of lag again
<prince-dari> Not really.
<Edward_Newgate> Discord = Almost the Joker, but not quite
<VishalElm> Is anyone else having chat problems? Or is it just my internets?
<Edward_Newgate> Joker is my favorite character of anything ever
<Edward_Newgate> Discord is a close second though
<Zephirdd> Discord IS a pony
<Fluttershy`> 08,1prince-dari I noticed lag at least earlier... and Silvermane and the others are complaining of lag?
<Edward_Newgate> part-pony
<Zephirdd> A Draconiquos or whatever it is called
<Zephirdd> but he IS a pony
<Zephirdd> "head of a pony, body of a dragon" or something like that
<Zephirdd> I have lag too
<Edward_Newgate> Does that make Gilda an Eagle?
<Zephirdd> on chat
<VishalElm> I want to RPEEEEEEE
<Flaria> Draconequis, I think it is
<Zephirdd> oh
<RDash> Fluttershy` Yes, I just assumed it was me. I don't receive any messages, then like 10 at once...:P
<Zephirdd> well, she's a Griphin :s
<Zephirdd> or w/e its spelt
<Edward_Newgate> Half eagle half lion, same thing as Discord
<Edward_Newgate> So, by your logic, Gilda=eagle
*VishalElm climbs up the wall, sits on the celing
<Zephirdd> no, she is lion
<Zephirdd> :D
<Edward_Newgate> Also, massive amounts of b'awww http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/8aa2233bf6ca93134e7c5d45ab199585/60013%20-%20Dragon%20Ima_crying_like_the_little_girl%20adult%20ask%20ask_twilight_sparkle%20comic%20featured_image%20grown_up%20manly_tears%20oh_god_im_crying%20sad%20spike%20tumblr%20twilight_sparkle%20why_god_whyyy!!!.jpg
<MrChang> is it me or is it lagging?
<Fluttershy`> 08,1it's lagging...
<RDash> MrChang Not you
<Zephirdd> its lagging
<VishalElm> Hey, everypony with wings! Lets have a party up here on the ceiling. :3
<prince-dari> Nah.
<prince-dari> Twilight will just die of old age.
*Zephirdd has no wings, is an unicorn
<Zephirdd> :(
<prince-dari> Before Spike's too big.
<VishalElm> Fluttershy`: join me?
<Edward_Newgate> Prince-buzzkill
<Flaria> >Celestia was previous element of harmony
<MrChang> why's it lagging?
<Edward_Newgate> Seriously Dari, you're being a real downer today
<Flaria> >Twilight and co. might live as long
<MrChang> what kinda shenans is this?
*Xerion parties on ceiling
<prince-dari> >Celestia is a God
<prince-dari> >Twilight isn't
<prince-dari> a god*
<Edward_Newgate> >Spitfire is best pony
<VioletVanilla> 6sobsob
<Edward_Newgate> >Rainbowdash isn't
*VishalElm parties with Xerion
<Flaria> prince-dari: Why you so mean today :C
<prince-dari> God is a term much too lowly to describe Dash.
<Zephirdd> unlesss Twilight & co. turn into Alicorns by some crazy spell
<Zephirdd> they will live as long as anyponyelse
<VishalElm> Everypony join me!
<Zephirdd> Also, Celestia is a Demigod, as Gods don't have a real form or whatsoever
<prince-dari> Flaria: I dunno.
<RDash> Edward_Newgate Woah, woah, woah. Spitfire is pretty awesome, but this is Rainbow Dash that we're talking about here!
*Flaria hugs prince-dari
<Zephirdd> and she isn't all-powerful, she is just imortal
<Edward_Newgate> Spitfire is the leader of the wonderbolts. Dash can't even get in. Do the math
<prince-dari> Zephirdd: I corrected 'God' to 'a god' for that reason.
<Zephirdd> >mfw RD is on the bottom of my fav-main-pony-list
<Edward_Newgate> Zephirdd; Ever heard of Greek mythology?
<Flaria> What did I start, oh celestia
<Edward_Newgate> They weren't all powerful and had forms
<VishalElm> ... I need more winged ponies for mah ceiling party.
<prince-dari> Dash is too good for the Wonderbolts.
<mooponi> ^
<RDash> Zephirdd :O That is like speaking the language of Mordor in the Sire
<RDash> Shire*
<mooponi> what do the wonderbolts even do
<mooponi> just fly around
<mooponi> boring
<LordCelestia> Yes, flaria?
<mooponi> rbd fights dragons and star trek characters
<Zephirdd> oh well, true that Edward_Newgate, but we barely have many forms of gods :s

<Fluttershy`> 08,1If you are experiencing lag, download mIRC and type /server irc.ponychat.net to join this network then /join #BronyState
<RDash> ctrlx I think Dari scripted Steven
<ctrlx> flutterxchat2 is better
<ctrlx> er
<ctrlx> Fluttershy`, xchat2 is better
<ctrlx> tabfail
<LordCelestia> Can't download stuff on this computer :(
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I like mIRC
<ctrlx> LordCelestia, hack the planet
<RDash> I may try chatzilla
<ctrlx> chatzilla's alright if you don't irc a lot
<Fluttershy`> 08,1look up irc chat clients LordCelestia there's probably other embedded irc clients online that will do the same thing
<ctrlx> other than mibbit
*RDash doesnt irc a lot
<ctrlx> mibbit is horrible
<ctrlx> i have 5 servers open :x
<LordCelestia> oooh
<ctrlx> 11 channels
<Fluttershy`> 08,1it's pretty easy to figure out
<LordCelestia> Well im not in a hacky mood ctrlx, so Ill try fluttershys method
<LordCelestia> ^thaks
<LordCelestia> *thanks
<Zephirdd> I'm using ChatZilla and it seems to be fine
<ctrlx> LordCelestia, GIVE ME YOUR INTERNETS
<ctrlx> the first true irc client i used was turboirc
<ctrlx> that was lol
<RDash> I do have mIRC downloaded
<RDash> Not much of a fan of it myself, I find mibbit much more convenient
<RDash> Plus I'm lazy :P
<ctrlx> i do like irssi a lot
<Fluttershy`> 08,1ChatZilla is a firefox plug in just warning you LordCelestia
<FreezeFrame> I use a paid-for copy of mIRC
<ctrlx> mibbit is so slowwww ;-;
<LordCelestia> Any particular ones i could use?
<ctrlx> one the reasons why i hate mirc. pay
<LordCelestia> I searched embedded IRC clients and got nothing yet
<Fluttershy`> 08,1LordCelestia do you use Firefox?
<ctrlx> LordCelestia, i *could* let you ssh into my server and use irssi
<ctrlx> but that's kinda silly and you might as well just use mibbit
<FreezeFrame> ctrlx: It's easy enough to ignore the nagware part
<ctrlx> FreezeFrame, xchat2 is freeeeeeee~
<ctrlx> unlike regular xchat for some reason
<FreezeFrame> I already paid for mRIC
<FreezeFrame> mIRC*
<FreezeFrame> And it's what I'm used to.
<LordCelestia> NO, i have internet explorer
<ctrlx> D:> internet explorer?
<Flaria> ^Why.
<Flaria> WHY
<Flaria> SHUN
<ctrlx> i feel for you
<Fluttershy`> 08,1LordCelestia you're using IE?! You poor thing!!
<Flaria> SHUN THE NONBELIEVER
*Flaria shuns LordCelestia
<ctrlx> Flaria, we should help our brony!
<LordCelestia> i know, im such a poor soul
<LordCelestia> HOLD ME
*ctrlx holds LordCelestia
<ctrlx> inb4 moon
<Zephirdd> LordCelestia: download Firefox
*LordCelestia jumps into fluttershys arms but is too heavy
<Zephirdd> NOW
<FreezeFrame> LordCelestia needs computer training.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1LordCelestia FIRST GO TO http://www.firefox.com
*Flaria burps and breathes a bit of fire
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I don't care if you parents or whoever says you can't download stuff
<FreezeFrame> Or google.com/chrome
<Fluttershy`> 08,1if you don't download it
<Fluttershy`> 08,1you will DIE
<ctrlx> FreezeFrame, he could just be on a locked down terminal
<Zephirdd> that'd be terrible
<LordCelestia> oh god just like that internet meme that says You will Die
<ctrlx> NewDCD, hai :3/
<Zephirdd> hi dcd
<Fluttershy`> 08,1NOW YOU MUST DOWNLOAD IT
<RDash> LordCelestia What?! IE? *gasp*
*Flaria hugs NewDCD
<LordCelestia> I never knew IE was so frowned upon. hehe
*Diftraku bangs head continously on the wall
<Diftraku> MySQL crashed
<ctrlx> Flaria, aren't we just hte huggy snuggly type? :P
<NewDCD> I just got home from Uni
<NewDCD> Dear God
<NewDCD> That Organic Chem test makes me feel like they ripped open a new asshole in me
*Natleyn hugs ctrlx
<Fluttershy`> 08,1LordCelestia IE is the DEVIL
<Natleyn> Hello.
<Dashite> Which version of IE are you using?
<ctrlx> ohai Natleyn :3/
<ctrlx> Fluttershy`, it's not too bad....just a lot worse P:
<Fluttershy`> 08,1it sucks balls
<RDash> FreezeFrame No, Firefox :P
<ctrlx> better than safari
<Flaria> It's okay looking and everything loads terribly forever.
<ctrlx> omg you know what the best browser ever is?
<Flaria> Safari runs better on my computer. >_>
<RDash> LordCelestia It is *very* frowned upon :P
<ctrlx> netscape 5
<Dashite> Aw Yeah, Netscape!
<ctrlx> i just wish my quadcore was powerful enough to handle that beast
*RDash hugs DCD
<NewDCD> Fluttershy: fun fact, Internet Explorer is the only browser that seems to be able to hook to VHScrCap satisfactorily for Webcaster-Streaming
<NewDCD> so even if it normally sucks, it also has its unique uses
<Diftraku> Graphical browser?
<Diftraku> Oh please
<Diftraku> Lynx
<Dashite> :p
<Zephirdd> lol
<Dermathil> >mfw I realize that Discord is an evil enchanter who does evil dances and when you look in his eyes he puts you in trances...
<ctrlx> omg dude i tried to use lynx one time and my computer didn't even anymore it was so awesome of a browser
<LordCelestia> @Dashite the latest version
<Diftraku> Also, I _might_ have just crashed my web host's MySQL server...
<LordCelestia> i have windows 7
<Flaria> Dermathil: I know, right?
<ctrlx> Diftraku, why would you do such a thing?
<RDash> ctrlx lol
*RDash uses the Nightly Beta FireFox (Aurora)
<RDash> It's great
<Diftraku> All I did was do a bulk upload of 255 images I had on imgur
<RDash> Aaaand, I think the chat is derping
<Dermathil> Flaria: He’ll mix up an evil brew Then he’ll gobble you up in a big tasty stew in part 2
<Dashite> LordCelestia, that's really not so bad then.
<Flaria> Dermathil: I certainly hope not.
<Dermathil> would be pretty funny though
<ctrlx> Diftraku, something obviously went boogers
<Zephirdd> Diftraku, you should know better! don't do anything 255 related! D:
<Diftraku> :P
<Zephirdd> always 254 or less!
<Dermathil> Now pinkie could use finalized vers of Evil enchantre-- Evil Enchanter
<Zephirdd> evil number is evil
<Diftraku> Well, I uploaded 258 images, they were already on server side so it was just Shimmie adding them to the DB
<Zephirdd> lol
<ctrlx> This is for my bronies, ain't no phony / Shit that they can ferret out, no Killconey / O.G., real-as-hell flows for my cronies / Shit, it's all love, every pony's a homie
<Diftraku> Not my problem if the puny server can't handle my MySQL usage :3

<Flutterguy> How exactly are you making the cursors? Adobe stuff like Photoshop or Illustrator or Flash?
<Natleyn> Realworld Cursor Editor 2007~?
<Natleyn> 2006.1

<DJP0N-3> It even has a point
<Natleyn> DJP0N-3: Maybe.
<DJP0N-3> That is not very reassuring :P
<Natleyn> These are generic cursors, aside from a few select ones, like loading or link select that you see a lot
<ctrlx> wat
<herospirit> You guys had BETTER play Pony Emblem when it comes out

<Nittany_Tiger> I don't know why I am so tense right now. I hate when I feel tense.
<Flutterguy> Hoping you feel better.. worried about something?
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't know, but I have found out that my grandmother's condition has been deteriorating. She fell last week and broke her wrist. She's been in the hospital ever since.
<Nittany_Tiger> She's very old and frail.
<Flutterguy> Really sorry to hear about that. I know it might not really console you to say that, but I don't know what else to say, to be honest.
<Nittany_Tiger> I understand.
<Nittany_Tiger> Honestly, it doesn't sound like she has much time left, so I don't expect much fun in the near future.
<Flutterguy> Oh
<ctrlx> Nittany_Tiger, i work in a nursing home and the only real straightforward advice i can offer is that you just have to be accepting of it. yes you want to keep her alive and well but sometimes things happen especially with older folks. losing someone special is hard and as always with time it will get better. just hold on to the memories and know that she lives on through you and maybe that she's in a better place now. peace is better than living uncomforta
<ctrlx> bly. and besides, i bet she's lived a fulfilling life already :) just take the stress in strides. it'll be ok
<Nittany_Tiger> She's had an up and down life.
<Nittany_Tiger> I wish I could take her out to eat one more time.
<ctrlx> if at all possible, do so. i bet she'd love that
<Nittany_Tiger> Back when I lived at home, I used to do that every so often.
<Nittany_Tiger> If it's possible.
<ctrlx> or even take something in to her
<Nittany_Tiger> According to mom, she can barely eat and dress herself.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'll be going home in a week or less to visit her.
<ctrlx> i wish you and her the best of luck. to ease the tension a bit just try and keep your mind preoccupied every so often. it gives yourself a break from hte stress
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't handle stress well. There are reasons why. Put on top of that my thesis work. No chance for a break. Thank you though.
<ctrlx> anytime, brony. just don't explode and explode again. :P best of luck mate
<Nittany_Tiger> I'll be fine as long as I get to see her at least one more time.
<Matt> ive watched the first episode of season 2 about 30 times now O_O
<The_Mole> well a friend of mine may now be a brony. yay

<Matt> My internet browser just commited suicide

<RobotPinkie> 06,15The sea ponies in metal armature thing? :P
<Dermathil> maybe
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm not really into warhammer, sorry :(
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I do like your idea of including sea ponies, however.
<Dermathil> http://www.gosfordhobbies.com.au/shop/images/P/newimagelge-40.gif
<Turgle> sea ponies :I
<MeteorVenture> sea ponies are awesome.. although i don't think they should be in FiM
<Dermathil> that thing is a dreadnought
<Dermathil> MeteorVenture: 50% chance they appear in S2
<Dermathil> In the interview with Jayson
<MeteorVenture> am i not turgley enough for the turgle club?
<Dermathil> he mentioned that stuff may make a "splash" or some sort
<Turgle> waaat
<Dermathil> yeah
<MeteorVenture> if they do put them in there.. they better do a really good job
<Turgle> ^
<Turgle> the sa ponies
<Turgle> *sea
<Turgle> .___.
<Dermathil> yeah, but I ain't worried.
<Dermathil> They'd make the smooze awesome if they had to put it in.
<MeteorVenture> and shoobie doo all over that episode
<Dermathil> JT: Yeah, I mean, we definitely wanted, you know, one and two to make a splash, for, you know, the big two-parter...
<Dermathil> JT: Hmm... let me think... There... Well, it’s hard to say, I don’t know what people are gonna think, but yeah, there’s some great endings I think, there some... we try to make them unexpected where we can... So, there’s stuff in the works, let’s just say, that could potentially make a splash.
<Dermathil> that's why I am 50% sure the Seaponies will show up in S2.
<Turgle> oh gawd
<Turgle> shooo be dooo
<Turgle> xD
<Dermathil> hehehe
<Dermathil> nah
<Dermathil> they won't shooobedoo
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I very much doubt that "make a splash" refers to sea ponies, though I really hope they'll be in there.
<Turgle> well
<Turgle> we'll see
<Dermathil> RobotPinkie, I'm pretty sure the 2nd line I posted may be infact related to them
<MeteorVenture> make a splash refers to ponies in swimsuits.. my gosh
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm not sure he's even aware of sea ponies, but okay.
<Dermathil> Who?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Thiessen
<Turgle> JT
<Dermathil> I do remember that Lauren Faust wanted to include Seaponies in S1 but didn'T have the money
<Dermathil> So...
<Dermathil> I'm pretty sure he knows, btw.
<Dermathil> They DO lurk on EqD

*Diftraku has a brainfart
<Diftraku> I got the whole house for myself
<Diftraku> There's a projector in the living room
<Diftraku> You thinking what I am thinking?
<Diftraku> Move PC to living room, hook up to the projector and WATCH ALL THE PONIES!
<MeteorVenture> inb4 wallflower jokes
<MeteorVenture> hook it up to the ceiling and project it on the floor.. and duct tape yourself to the ceiling so you can watch it.. and when whoever else gets home you can explain!
<Diftraku> :P
<MeteorVenture> depending on how high-tech the projector is you could aim it at your mind and it would project the image directly into your brain
<MeteorVenture> err aim it at your head
<MeteorVenture> you could go to sleep with it projecting images into your mind and you would have some interesting dreams
<MeteorVenture> on ep 26 "the best night ever" does anyone else find it funny how those ponies outside of the gala were all singing along and stuff with the them but when they got inside of the gala the ponies there were just interested in doing whatever fancy things they were interested in doing?
<MeteorVenture> if pinkie wanted to party she should have went back outside with those ponies (that probably couldn't get into the gala and just loitered around)

<MeteorVenture> it's looking good so far
<MeteorVenture> >miss something >can't go back
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I watched maybe 10 minutes of it... and not really worth it. I mean I guess it's a cool idea, but the arrogance coupled with the sub-par editing... it just rubs me the wrong way. No offense.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That's obviously just my personal preference.
<MeteorVenture> i put it in my watch later thingy
<MeteorVenture> i never watch those
<MeteorVenture> but i probably will watch this one anyway
<MeteorVenture> it just kinda seemed like episode 1 all over again and i'm tired so i decided to watch it later
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'd prefer to just watch the first two episodes... I don't approve of the cuts. :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol I'm so mean

<Zephirdd> WHAAAAA
<Zephirdd> portal AND PONIES?
<Diftraku> Yes
<Diftraku> Portal and Ponies
<Zephirdd> counfound them
<Zephirdd> OH BOY
<Zephirdd> and the author
<Diftraku> I know, I spent an evenning just reading that fic
<Zephirdd> "just" the author of my all-time ficv
<Diftraku> :P
<Zephirdd> haha

<Zephirdd> too big, grimdark, and idk anything about the game despite that its post apocalyptic

<Zephirdd> well
<Diftraku> I read TNTNE without ever realizing it was a grimdark fic until reading the tags afterwards
<Zephirdd> wat is TNTNE?
<Diftraku> The Night That Never Ends
<Zephirdd> oh.
<Zephirdd> well
<Sumica> I would say past sins but that one seems to bring up too much hate....oh wait.
<Zephirdd> counfound those ponies
<Zephirdd> they drive me to read portal fics
<Diftraku> Sumica: I loved Past Sins
<Zephirdd> I loved Past Sins
<Diftraku> I re-read it when the author announced the rewrite
<prince-dari> Val likes Caramel because terrible fanon.
<Zephirdd> lol
<Sumica> Tad late Dari
<Trollestia> Never read Past Sins, what is it?
<Diftraku> lol
<Zephirdd> Caramel/mac?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh surprise, Dari brings up an old topic as an attempt to troll. I'm so completely surprised
<Diftraku> Trollestia: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/story-past-sins.html
<prince-dari> Val loves Caramac.
<Trollestia> Thank you.
<Diftraku> Who doesn't love Caramac?
<Zephirdd> diftraku answered it
<Diftraku> :3
<Zephirdd> :P
<Zephirdd> I hate caramac
<Zephirdd> Mac belongs to fluttershy
<Zephirdd> everypony knows that
<Zephirdd> :<
<Trollestia> Ew, Nyx. No thanks.
<Zephirdd> ^lol!
*Diftraku refers to that ungodly Excel file
<Zephirdd> Past Sins is what created Nyx
<MantisToboggan> past sins is quite good
<Trollestia> Twilight would *deserve* to be hung for that.
<MantisToboggan> the ending gets real predictable and is drawn out a little too much
<MantisToboggan> but it's quite an emotional ride
<MantisToboggan> overall worth reading, i've barely read any fics aside from that though
<Zephirdd> meh, idk what people complain about that story. It was quite good imo
<MantisToboggan> it was better than i'd expect a fic to be
<Zephirdd> yes, my thoughts exactly
<Sumica> So to change the topic I started reading article 2 last night. Intersting start but seems slow to update.
<Trollestia> Article two?
<FreezeFrame> I don't dislike either Caramac or Fluttermac
<FreezeFrame> I think both are good ships
<FreezeFrame> I do prefer Fluttermac, though.
<Diftraku> FreezeFrame: Same here
*Trollestia prefers Fluttermac due to My Dream Mare being almost headcanon.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Twilestishy Diane Cake is best ship.
<Diftraku> RobotPinkie: lol
<Sumica> It's one of those *gasp* humans in equiestria fics Trollestia
<FreezeFrame> Actually, I ship like... 4 different ponies with Mac
<Trollestia> *le gasp
<FlaschenJoe11> hello everyone
<FreezeFrame> (not at once)
<Diftraku> FreezeFrame: What's stopping you? :3
<FreezeFrame> Well, there is one three-member relationship in that set
<FreezeFrame> Trixiemac Sparkle
<FlaschenJoe11> MacHarem, the way of the stallion
<Diftraku> Hehe
<AllisZero> Damn
<AllisZero> This hurt
<AllisZero> A LOT
<AllisZero> Holy crap my ribs
<Sumica> stop doing it then?
<FreezeFrame> Great, now I want to see a fimfic that parodies harem animes with Mac as the central character.
<Diftraku> rofl
<AllisZero> Lul
<Diftraku> FreezeFrame: MacHarem as in MacDonalds
<AllisZero> Big Mac even has the personality of a typical harem MC
<FlaschenJoe11> Look upon me BronyState, For I! AM! FLASHENJOE11
<Sumica> oh jeae lovehina comes to mind.
*Trollestia shines the Sun on Joe.
<FreezeFrame> Only problem with Mac-shipping is the number of people who insist on AppleMac
<FlaschenJoe11> Jetpack
<FlaschenJoe11> no wing
<FlaschenJoe11> wings
<Diftraku> FreezeFrame: Yeah... that's...
<Diftraku> Disturnimg
<AllisZero> :| AppleMac? Wow, that's pushing it
<Diftraku> *Disturbing
*Trollestia combusts the fuel tank.
<Zephirdd> AppleMac? seriously? that's just... disgusting
<FreezeFrame> Mmhmm
<Zephirdd> wth
*FlaschenJoe11 uses his paraglider
<Diftraku> They're related for crying out loud!
<Apokalipse> Hello bronystate
<Trollestia> Hello.
<FlaschenJoe11> evenin' Apokalipse
<Diftraku> OHai Apokalipse
<Sumica> wait where was all this omg rage when you all were talking about CaraMac?
<Apokalipse> Why is everyone surprised at the lenghts this fandom goes to with their fics? AppleMac is hardly surprising
<FlaschenJoe11> Double Standarts
<FlaschenJoe11> they're normal
<FreezeFrame> Sumica: Caramel isn't explicitly a family member
<FreezeFrame> Some people make him an Apple, some people make him not an Apple
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he was refering to me Freezeframe
<FlaschenJoe11> look at other fandoms, it could be identical twins and some people would ship them
<Zephirdd> IMO best shipping is Elusive/Rarity, most hilarious shit I've ever seen
<AllisZero> Animu Twincest is win
<AllisZero> But start throwing innocent equines in the equation and suddenly I'm against it
<FlaschenJoe11> Luna is a Joker, you can write her to fit into EVERY STORY
<FreezeFrame> I was turned off of fanfics for a while after I accidentally read an Ayaka/Sammy shipfic....
<Zephirdd> Wait, Caramel is an Apple?
<FlaschenJoe11> apparrently
<AllisZero> I don't think I've ever read fanfiction, ever.
<FreezeFrame> Zephirdd: I've seen him called one in a few fics (where he's shipped outside the family)
<Apokalipse> We need steven magnet... only he knows how much % of Apple is in Caramel's bloodline
<FreezeFrame> He's usually just a hired hand in Caramac fics
<Zephirdd> IIRC Caramel was a paradoxal male/female pony
<Zephirdd> wasnt it?
<Trollestia> Caramel Apple seems pretty obvious.
<FreezeFrame> Caramel Apple was a different pony, though.
<FlaschenJoe11> The Light in the Darkness and Growing Pains are 2 of my personal favourites. Full End"horse"ment
*FlaschenJoe11 slaps himself for terrible pun
<FlaschenJoe11> Also, I MADE CUPCAKES!!!
<FlaschenJoe11> sry, I'm feeling random right now
<FlaschenJoe11> who remembers glompday?
<Zephirdd> glompday?
<Zephirdd> I"ve not been there.
<FlaschenJoe11> yesterday
<Zephirdd> lol
<FlaschenJoe11> LittleLuna "glomped" everypony except LordCelestia and me
<FlaschenJoe11> it was crazy
<Apokalipse> Screw Attack has a magazine?
<FlaschenJoe11> what are your favourite FF's?
<FlaschenJoe11> question goes to Everypony
<Sumica> x-2 =p
<AllisZero> There we go
<AllisZero> Piece of junk
<FreezeFrame> Six is best FF
<FreezeFrame> It's the only correct answer to that question, too.
<Sumica> I thought the only correct answer is not to play.
<FlaschenJoe11> everyone has their own opinion
<FreezeFrame> FlaschenJoe11: I'm being a bit facetious
<Trollestia> You lie, LittleLuna didn't touch me.
<Sumica> And I am just beeing an ASS it seems, so I went with x-2
<FlaschenJoe11> sry, you barely said anything during the glompage, I forgot you were there
*FlaschenJoe11 rubs his neck nervously
<Trollestia> Oh well.
<FlaschenJoe11> Q: who should return for another episode, Trixie or Gilda?
<FlaschenJoe11> if you HAD TO choose one of them
<Diftraku> Trixie, definately
<FreezeFrame> Gilda
<FreezeFrame> MLP needs more non-ponies
<FlaschenJoe11> Gilda for a RBD centric episode with a duet song
<Zephirdd> MLP needs Flutterponies
<Zephirdd> as seen on The Movie
<Rainbow-Dash> Those things with the laterns on their heads?
<FlaschenJoe11> their queen had this weird flower/showgirl thing on her head

<Suinide> Oh hey wait i can all of a sudden :3 but still i cant watch it, im in school, has to pay attention
<Cynder7> 6Aa,ok :P
<Suinide> I use the term pay attention loosely, but still
<Suinide> Math at the end of the day is awful :/
<Apokalipse> I'll take that as a no then.
<Cynder7> 6We had that today ._.
<prince-dari> I pretty much have maths all day every day now.
<Cynder7> 6It sucks,especially if you have an ass of a teacher.. ._.
<Cynder7> 6>.<
<Veewave> What would you have me do, mail it to you?
<Suinide> Shes not, shes funny
<Apokalipse> Of course
<prince-dari> Maths, further maths, physics (so far just maths), and chemistry (so far very little other than maths).
<Suinide> But still, im in the back, she doesnt pay attention to me, im wearing my beanie, and i dont care :p
<Suinide> I have anatomy and physiology
<Cynder7> 6Meh,that's good..
<Veewave> Hows about I give you a symbolic one on the interweb.
<Suinide> I get to disect a cat and a pig, and maybe a kidney
*Veewave gives Apokalipse a Luna bar
*Apokalipse treasures symbolic Luna bar
<Cynder7> 6D: My friend has to disect a pig too :P Luckily we don't get that kind of stuff here..Basically there's quite a lot we don't get here.. ._.
<Sumica> Oh wow, I have missed alot of Zero Punctuation.
<prince-dari> Hm.
<Suinide> That sucks
<prince-dari> At my school we got to disect eyes, fish, and hearts.
<prince-dari> That was pretty much it I think.
*FlaschenJoe11 hums Art of the dress
<Suinide> Ive disected a lamb eye a frog and a worm
*Veewave doesn't use periods when doing symbolic activities
<prince-dari> Hearts were pretty funny.
<Suinide> Worm was stupid :P
<Cynder7> 6Eyes? DDD:
<prince-dari> >stick fingers through heart valves in peace sign
<Suinide> Id love to disect a heart...
<Apokalipse> The Škoda Octavia VRS is the worlds fastest 2.0 litre supercharged production car... kind of pony related
<prince-dari> The lens in the eye's pretty weird.
<Suinide> Id love to disect a human in general, explore every inch
<Cynder7> 6Prefferably heart than eyes.. x.x
<prince-dari> It feels artifically manufactured.
<Cynder7> 6*shivers*
<prince-dari> Well, IMO anyway.

<Spyrorocks> maybe just write a script to reset every night at 12am
<Veewave> Wasn;t Luna supposed to help?
<Suinide> I guess, if theyve done it and liked it, even if they wouldnt ever again for pride reasons id call them bi. Curious is a tricky word
<Veewave> Defeat Discord I mean.
<Aristeo> AHA
*Dark_Shadow_Dragon 2puts up a wall keeping Suinide
<Aristeo> I have a new lead
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 2i figure you were bi
<Aristeo> logrotator

<Suinide> Whos head?
<Cynder7> 6Mine :P
<Apokalipse> Because nobody updated the countdown
<Dashite> Because no one has bothered to update it recently. :/
<Sumica> has the show time clock thing ever worked?
<Suinide> Your not a newborn...or did you shave your head?
<Apokalipse> yes
<Veewave> yes
<Edward_Newgate> Because Dari is a bigger troll than Discord
<Apokalipse> yes
<Sumica> must have somthing blocking it on my end.
*Veewave is the winner
<JohnAtMC> @Edward: lol
<Cynder7> 6Lol no :P For some reason I had that hairloss thing you get when you suffer from stress or whatever..I still don't see how..
<Suinide> Oh, freaky...
<Cynder7> 6Luckily it doesn't really show
<Veewave> @Edwardmeter JohnAtMC
<Steven_Magnet> 6 JohnAtMC is 7% Edward. (204)

<JohnAtMC> Does it only work on some browsers?
<Cynder7> 6Still,the little fuzz feels adorable xD
<Suinide> Peach fuzz!
<Cynder7> 6:D

<NewDCD> 9you guys, we take time reading applications
<NewDCD> 9and discussing them as a team
<Trollestia> It is complete.
<NewDCD> 9so your replies might take a while
<LordCelestia> Edward_Newgate, thats inapproptriate
<Edward_Newgate> Not really
<LordCelestia> >: (
<PrincessMolestia> 13Thats... painfully borderline lol

<PrincessMolestia> 13But it is suggesting y'know lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes, please no shipping here
<PrincessMolestia> 13Edward knows lol
<LordCelestia> Under my rule there will only be lesbianism between characters that Ive actually heard of. And I dont know who the brown one is.
<PrincessMolestia> 13Hes testin the waters :P
<Edward_Newgate> Can't trust you because of your irrational hatred of shipping
<Silvermane> OH GOD

<Silvermane> PRINCESSMOLESTIA
<PrincessMolestia> 13YES?
*Silvermane hides from his prior... 'lover'
<PrincessMolestia> 13lol
*Silvermane whimpers in fear
<LordCelestia> Oh wait a minute... I thought she was licking her breast, but i took another look and saw what was really happenind. *phew* haha
<PrincessMolestia> 13As for no lesbianism... LordCelestia gtfo >:|
<Edward_Newgate> Yeah, there's no explicit anything
<TrollightSparkle> ..
<Revolver> Ohai PrincessMolestia
<LordCelestia> I was joking silly
<RDash> Silvermane You're cheating on RBD? :O
<Silvermane> lordcelestia, pm that?
<RDash> :P
<LordCelestia> Lesbianism is smiled upon in my kingdom
<Silvermane> RDash, course not

<PrincessMolestia> 13Dat "handling"
<Dashite> Hey! It's not 10pm yet!
<herospirit> You missed quite a party Val
*Revolver pokes PrincessMolestia

<NewDCD> 9I had some of the best mecha weapon concepts ever
*Silvermane hugs PrincessMolestia "Please don't eat me"
*PrincessMolestia 13pokes Revolver back... but he probably doesnt want to know with what
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh?
<herospirit> Trolololololololololo
*PrincessMolestia 13pokes Silvermane too
<NewDCD> 9but I'm wondering whether I should integrate them into the same robot
<Silvermane> ooo, soft
<AllisZero> Hey all this kicking sounds like abuse of power to me, I interject
<Diftraku> NewDCD: You probably don't want my life story in the app, just what I can do etc.?
*Revolver punches PrincessMolestia
*LordCelestia is here to protect you all. Have no fear.
<NewDCD> 9(the Valjean)
<AllisZero> inb4 kick

*Trollestia fires the friendship cannon at Revolver.
<Revolver> TAKE THAT YOU BLOODY PRINCESS!

<NewDCD> 9dunno what to do with the Arkblade though
<AllisZero> I'll draw a french-looking mech for you, DCD
*LordCelestia has the raw power. Trollestia has the pure lulz. And Molestia, well... idk, i guess she just scares everypony.
<Edward_Newgate> ALL HAIL VALSEIDON KING OF THE SEA PONIES
*Silvermane licks PrincessMolestia on the cheek. "I need a shower, so laters. If you see NMM, give her... well, you know... for me, okay?"
<NewDCD> 9the Valjean has a pilot, but the Arkblade would probably end up being my personal self-insert bullshit mech
<Revolver> no, no I didn't PrincessMolestia
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<NewDCD> 9OKAY now listen to my WEPON
<Flaria> SHOO BE DOO

<herospirit> :]
<Edward_Newgate> @meter my hatred for RainbowDash
<Edward_Newgate> my hatred for RainbowDash is 100%
<PrincessMolestia> 13Itd be funny if a group of explorers went on an expedition to some pyramids and on the walls they deciphered that Rainbow Dash is to be shipped with everyone ever o.O
*Trollestia boards the HMS Appledash.

*RDash couldnt click the pic fast enough :P
<PrincessMolestia> 13My first thought would be.... "how did the Egyptians know about RD?"
<NewDCD> 9yeah I guess those are enough samples
<herospirit> So Edward. If you got the chance to off Rainbow-Dash, you'd take it?
<Edward_Newgate> ...I think I would
*Dermathil waves at NewDCD
<herospirit> :0
<Edward_Newgate> But mainly to piss off most of the bronies
<Dashite> :O
<herospirit> I'm setting up body gaurds
<herospirit> :I
<Flaria> Hiya Dermathil
<ValtheJean> 2,14 DCD, if I had to pick one move from Z2 to show someone how awesome it is, what move/which mech, should I pick?
<NewDCD> 9hey Derma
<TrollightSparkle> Hy Dermathil
*Edward_Newgate very much dislike RD if you can't tell
*Trollestia sends a special forces detail to duard Rainbow-Dash.
<Trollestia> guard
<NewDCD> 9Val: Amuro's Fin Funnel Dynamic Kill
<Dermathil> Valthejean: pretty sure he's gonna suggest a combo move
<herospirit> Z2?
<NewDCD> 9also Val
<Dermathil> NewDCD: that be Nu Gundam?
<NewDCD> 9here's a little spoiler for that fic of mine you'll never read
<NewDCD> 9Derma: yeah
<NewDCD> 9but here's the spoiler
<NewDCD> 9"Cease your foolishness at once, Prince Marius Blueblood!"
<Rainbow-Dash> Wait what?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Prince Marius...should I know who that is? (I get the blueblood part)
<Rainbow-Dash> Herospirit.. What did you do?!
<Dermathil> Valthejean, sounds like a firstname. Prolly a firstname in a fic for blueblood.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, it's not really a spoiler if it's just "oh btw blueblood is in it"
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I figured it was Blueblood is some bad guy I should know
<Trollestia> *yawn*
<Trollestia> brb, food
<TrollightSparkle> So guys..
<NewDCD> 9actually it's the opposite, Val
<NewDCD> 9also remember a certain name from Les Miserables
<ValtheJean> 2,14 eh...it's been forever since I read it....remind me?
<NewDCD> 9a certain rebel who used to be almost royalistic, yes?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ah
<NewDCD> 9and threw it away to be poor but happy
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I see now
<Dermathil> newdcd, pm
<ValtheJean> 2,14 can't say I like comparing him to blueblood, but hey, it's your fic :P
*Flaria sighs
<TrollightSparkle> Hm? Why Flaria?
<Diftraku> g'night everypony, time for me to hit the hay
<TrollightSparkle> Bye Diftraku
<Dashite> Hey PrincessMolestia! What was #5 in the drawfriend?
<NewDCD> 9it's a different Blueblood in that fic, actually..in the sense that I wrote his first appearance BEFORE he appeared in the series
<Diftraku|Sleeping> Let's see how many times irssi crashes
<Diftraku|Sleeping> Anyhoof, g'night
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ah
<herospirit> Here I am again
<NewDCD> 9so the Blueblood in my fic is Blueblood but isn't a douche like canon!Blueblood...and instead pretended to be a douche for...personal reasons
<Trollestia> Food GET
<Dashite> Oh there it is
<Flaria> TrollightSparkle: I don't really know.
<NewDCD> 9well

<Flaria> Seeya NewDCD.
<RDash> Dashite Wait, you found #5? I am curious as well :P
<Dashite> It was linked in the comments.
<Rainbow-Dash> I have to see #5
<Dashite> Ctrl-f background pony 723
<RDash> Ah ok, thanks
*RDash braces himself for sauce
<Dashite> Artist comments: "LOL, I make a clean version of my clop pic and it's still too saucy for EqD. "
<AllisZero> lol
<Dermathil> awesome
<herospirit> Dashie, I didn't receive it
<Dermathil> xDDD
<Dermathil> (jk Jk)
<herospirit> you must have sent it while I was gone :P
<RDash> 0.0 That's an interesting picture
<AllisZero> Well
<Rainbow-Dash> I agree RDash
<AllisZero> This might be a good Luna + Celestia + Twi desktop background
<herospirit> Oh. By the way. Discord can't decide whether you should live or die.
<herospirit> http://www.discodiscord.com/?video=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFGitBIedvbY%26feature%3Drelated&bpm=95
*Ziltoid comes back people still talking about clopfics
<TrollightSparkle> clop pic*
<Dashite> We aren't talking about clopfics...
<TrollightSparkle> Either way though.. yeah, it's a bit awkward to walk into right..? o_o
<Ziltoid> Clopfics are always implied
<Ziltoid> Always.
<herospirit> That was. An interesting picture.
<Dashite> Ooo! Story update!
*herospirit deletes internet history
<Ziltoid> What picture?
<Ziltoid> daw
<Flaria> I wish I knew why I'm in such a crappy mood.
<Dashite> #5 in the draw friend.
<Ziltoid> oh yeah
<Dashite> It was "Too Saucy" linked in comments.
<Ziltoid> I think I know what chu talking about
<TrollightSparkle> Flaria, what's up?
<Dashite> It was a Nightmare Moon pic.
*Trollestia is off to find #5
<Dashite> Apple_Bloom evolved into Colgate!
<Flaria> I don't even know.
<Flaria> I don't even have the right music to turn it to productive energy. -__-
<TrollightSparkle> Bored, stressed?
<herospirit> NO GUYS WE NEED TO EXPLORE
<TrollightSparkle> Explore?
<PrincessMolestia> 13Dont worry, you can explore things with me. :D
<TrollightSparkle> Oh, you.

<Flaria> I'll be on later tomorrow night.
<Flaria> Like always.
*PrincessMolestia 13takes Herospirit back to her room for some "legit"ness
<TrollightSparkle> Going then natleyn?
<Natleyn> AFK for now.
<herospirit> *from PrincessMolestia's room is heard, "JOHN MADDEN. JOHN MADDEN. JOHN MADDEN. FOOTBALL!"*
*herospirit exits PrincessMolestia's room.
<TrollightSparkle> Well bye then
<Natleyn> I'll try to put the anger to use making cursors, but I don't know.
<Dashite> AEIOU AEIOU AEIOU
<Natleyn> I'll be lurking like normal, though.
<herospirit> Molestia is totally legit.
<TrollightSparkle> Question mark exclamation point question mark exclamation point
<herospirit> You should check out her room guys
<herospirit> YOU GOTTA EXPLORE
<PrincessMolestia> 13Here comes another Chinese earthquake ;)
<TrollightSparkle> ebrbrbrbrbr
<herospirit> *chinese earthquake is heard from Molestia's room*
<herospirit> She's getting legit with someone in there. :I
<TrollightSparkle> That would be me. :)
<TrollightSparkle> We were just having a nice chat over tea. It wasn't like that.
<Natleyn> You know you've loaded the wrong music onto your mp3 player when you have a thousand songs and listen to less than 100 consistently.
*Natleyn sighs
<TrollightSparkle> ^
<TrollightSparkle> But in my case, it's around 600 loaded, and 50-60 listened to..
<herospirit> Well obviously Trollight
<herospirit> I can't think of anything else you'd be doing
<herospirit> Tea is legit.
<TrollightSparkle> Better yet, coffee. Coffee is baws.
<herospirit> Speaking of which
<TrollightSparkle> ?
<herospirit> Is "I Can't Decide" Pinkamena's official theme? Because it should be.
<Natleyn> It's my Pinkamina's theme, definitely.
<TrollightSparkle> Listening to it at the moment.
<TrollightSparkle> It does sound like her theme.
<herospirit> I like how you take my linking coffee to that in stride.
<TrollightSparkle> :D
<herospirit> You do not so much as question my "speaking of which" :P
<TrollightSparkle> Oh? Why not though?
<LordCelestia> Trollight sparkle, wanna do some random RP?
<TrollightSparkle> Sho, how do we do it?
<LordCelestia> join #silvershipper
<TrollightSparkle> K, hold on
<ValtheJean> 2,14 please keep advertisements for #silvershipper on PMs
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that goes for any room really
<LordCelestia> Alright ill keep that in mind
<Natleyn> hey herospirit
<Natleyn> Check yer pm.
<TrollightSparkle> .
<Rainbow-Dash> A friendly reminder from the Ministry of Morale http://risenlordm.deviantart.com/art/Pinkie-Pie-s-1984-217615389?q=boost%3Apopular%20fallout%20equestria%20pinkie&qo=2
<Rainbow-Dash> Anyway, bedtime. Bye
<TrollightSparkle> Bye Rainbow-Dash
<herospirit> Night Dashie
<TrollightSparkle> So.. yeah. Your face is pretty soft!
<Natleyn> Night Rainbow-Dash.
<TrollightSparkle> Hi Nittany
*Natleyn is late again. le sigh
<Nittany_Tiger> Thank goodness I have an USB keyboard.
*Natleyn hugs Nittany_Tiger
<Nittany_Tiger> :>
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.
*Nittany_Tiger hugs back.
<RDash> Night Dash!
<Nittany_Tiger> Took my laptop to Best Buy. They said it might cost around $800 to totally repair it.
<TrollightSparkle> Wow. Did they say what exactly was wrong with it?
<Nittany_Tiger> I told them what I did.
<TrollightSparkle> Hmm.. $800 is pretty much 1&1/2 new laptops..
<Nittany_Tiger> They said that they couldn't touch the keyboard because of the milk. They said the milk was considered a "biological hazard."
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Nittany_Tiger> I tried to buy one today, but the one I settled on was out of stock.
<TrollightSparkle> Milk a biological hazard? Sounds to me like a REALLY stupid excuse to take $800..
<LordCelestia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK4gm4wixH0&feature=related
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't get it.
<Nittany_Tiger> Anyway, I also have a broken case. The plastic is fragile from age now.
<Nittany_Tiger> So if I sent it to the manufacturer, they would replace the keyboard and case. They might also replace the motherboard just in case it was damaged.
<Nittany_Tiger> Which means they would replace over half of the laptop.
<Nittany_Tiger> I found this really nice laptop over at Best Buy, but it was barely too expensive.
<TrollightSparkle> It sounds confusing.. I hope you get it straightened out.
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Nittany_Tiger> I also need to figure out how to get this info off of this laptop.
<Nittany_Tiger> I need to send off my 1TB external HD for repair. I think they can do it. It may be expensive, though.
*Natleyn hugs Nittany_Tiger
*Nittany_Tiger hugs back.
<Natleyn> Thats a terrible position to be at :C
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
*Denied_Existence 3hugs Natleyn
<Nittany_Tiger> They said that my laptop may be in a week at best.
<Nittany_Tiger> But I'm going to be heading home to visit my grandmother by then.
*Natleyn hugs Denied_Existence
<Nittany_Tiger> I'll probably just check out laptops at home.
<Randall116> HELLO THAR!
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.
<Diftraku|Sleeping> Nittany_Tiger: what sort of laptop you considering? Since I need to buy one as well
*Natleyn hugs Diftraku|Sleeping
<Natleyn> Not so asleep, eh.
<Diftraku|Sleeping> nope xD
<TrollightSparkle> Hi Randall
<Diftraku|Sleeping> just checking if irssi is still up on my mobile
<Randall116> I shee O_O
<Natleyn> Oh.
<Nittany_Tiger> Something less than $400. I could go higher, but the warranty plan would put me in a situation where I wouldn't have much money left. Lemme find the ones I was considering.
<RDash> Time for me to hit the hay. Goodnight everypony
<TrollightSparkle> Night Rdash
<RDash> Rofl GGgala
<Diftraku|Sleeping> g'night RDash
<RDash> XD
<Randall116> FAREWELL
<Natleyn> Goodnight RDash!
<Randall116> (O_O)/"
<Natleyn> .__.
*Natleyn huddles down in a dark corner
<TrollightSparkle> :d
<Diftraku|Sleeping> I'm looking at something along the lines of 17" screen, keyboard with numpad and it must be able to house 2 hdds
<Natleyn> Heh.
<Nittany_Tiger> http://tinyurl.com/3hznplg Here was the one I was going to buy.
<Diftraku|Sleeping> i already got an hp pro-book on the consideration list :3
<Natleyn> Second best part of my day: Getting to put Move ***** on my mp3 player for when I get stuck in traffic.
<Natleyn> Nittany_Tiger: Damn, that's a nice laptop o_o
<Diftraku|Sleeping> it is quite
<Diftraku|Sleeping> the probook I was recommended is somewhere around 930 euros
<TrollightSparkle> I'll.. be back.
<Natleyn> Okay.
*Diftraku|Sleeping stsrts humming the Terminator ending theme
<Diftraku|Sleeping> I really hate buying a cheap laptop only to curse how slow it is
<Nittany_Tiger> http://tinyurl.com/448umad This was the one I was eyeing, but couldn't afford.
<Nittany_Tiger> I can't afford a $700 - $800 laptop.
<Nittany_Tiger> I only have $850 in the bank right now.
<Nittany_Tiger> I liked that second one because it had a Radeon card instead of the Intel POSs.
<Diftraku|Sleeping> yeah
<Diftraku|Sleeping> i'd go for the second tbh
<Natleyn> ;~;
<Diftraku|Sleeping> it's 80 bucks pricier but it has a bit more kick
<Natleyn> What about http://tinyurl.com/3qqq57u ?
*Natleyn is also looking for a new computer
<elnegro> hola
<TrollightSparkle> Natleyn, it looks pretty good, but will you be using it for everyday stuff or intensive like programs?
<Natleyn> Intensive how? Like a marathon of Crysis or something?
<Diftraku|Sleeping> i'm bit worried about just 3gb of ram
<Natleyn> I don't have a lot of cpu-taxing stuff since it won't run anyway on this.
<Natleyn> JUST 3gb?
<Natleyn> I'm working with 1.4gb right now
<Diftraku|Sleeping> oh well, s-pose it could work with your usage :3
<TrollightSparkle> Sorry, my mouse died momentarily -_-
<Natleyn> xD
<TrollightSparkle> But I think 3GB will be plenty for you Natleyn
<Natleyn> I'm not gonna run ri-
<Natleyn> Errr.
<TrollightSparkle> Run.. what..?
<Natleyn> I'm not going to run high-req gaming marathons.
<Natleyn> I think the most taxing thing I own is probably Borderlands, and I've run it on worse than that one.
<Natleyn> I can't play it on my current computer, though.
<Diftraku|Sleeping> I got 8gb jusr because I run multiple programs at the same time, including VMs
<TrollightSparkle> FML, my mouse hates me ._.
<Natleyn> :C
<Natleyn> What kind of mouse is everypony using?
<TrollightSparkle> An old Logitech mouse that's the only thing I've got :/
<Diftraku|Sleeping> steelseries cataclysm one
<TrollightSparkle> Damn fancy mice and keyboards.
<Diftraku|Sleeping> g510 as my kb
<Natleyn> Apple keyboard with keypad, here.
<Natleyn> I'm running windows, but I like their keyboard.
<TrollightSparkle> It's funny.. cause here I am with the old stock Dell kb and a wired Logitech wheel mouse..

<Fluttershy`> 08,1you know why it's not crazy in here? XP
<TrollightSparkle> Hey you!
<Fluttershy`> 08,1because all the craziness went elsewhere
<Fluttershy`> 08,1hehe
<Natleyn> It's crazy somewhere else
<Diftraku|Sleeping> lol
<Natleyn> http://tinyurl.com/3keuwze is my mouse
<Trollestia> My mouse is a Logitech MX518.
<TrollightSparkle> Damnit, I'm so ghetto.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1yup
<Fluttershy`> 08,1dat's what happens
*Fluttershy` turns into a tree
<TrollightSparkle> I'm running Athlon X3 455 and a Radeon HD 6870.. and I can't afford a better mouse -.-
<Diftraku|Sleeping> TrollightSparkle: was that vid directed to me? :3
<TrollightSparkle> Huh what vid?
<Natleyn> Trollestia*
<Diftraku|Sleeping> bah
<Natleyn> autocomplete fail
<Trollestia> My keyboard is a Logitech K120.
<Diftraku|Sleeping> i'm on mobile
<TrollightSparkle> I'm talking to you guys.. and playing Crysis :3
<Trollestia> Natleyn: What?
<Natleyn> Fixing what Diftraku said.
<Trollestia> In that case, sure.
<Diftraku|Sleeping> yeah, autocomplete fail'd
<Trollestia> It was really directed at everypony, but why not?
<Diftraku|Sleeping> :3
*Diftraku|Sleeping points to nick
*Natleyn hugs Diftraku|Sleeping again
<Natleyn> Sleep well!
<Diftraku|Sleeping> i will :)
<Diftraku|Sleeping> anyhoof , cya in few hours
<Trollestia> Ah. I see. :3
<TrollightSparkle> Bye Diftraku
<Diftraku|Sleeping> if I figure how to close this ssh connection without closing irssi
<Diftraku|Sleeping> here goes!
*Diftraku|Sleeping disappears in a puff, leaving a dummu behind
<TrollightSparkle> Crap, need to fix irc, brb
<TrollightSparkle> That's better.
<Dashite> WHAT?! Rarity isn't the element of harmony. Someone needs to fix this!
<TrollightSparkle> generosity* you mean?
<TrollightSparkle> And welcome back NewDCD
<NewDCD> 9>Reading that Caramel x Twilight fic
*Natleyn hugs NewDCD
<Natleyn> >_>
<Dashite> That's what it should be, but the ponychat server disagrees.
<NewDCD> 9>Caramel’s heart was beating three times faster than it should have.

<TrollightSparkle> Oh, ok..
<NewDCD> 9the bishoneny pony from Winter Wrap-Up
<NewDCD> 9that lost the seeds
<Dashite> Pontang, Typo eh? I can see how you accidentally hit the harmony key instead of the generosity key. I mean, they are so close together. :D
<Pontang> It'll be fixed soon. :o
<Pontang> But someone didn't know that Rarity was the Element of Generosity *Cough*
<Dashite> :O
<Dashite> Someone needs to watch more pony.
<Pontang> I know.
<Pontang> :(
<Natleyn> Night Trollestia.

<TrollightSparkle> Night to you

*Natleyn puts on soothing :50 chiptune clip, infinite single song loop
<Natleyn> Welp, that feels a little better.
<TrollightSparkle> Yay for loops
<ctrlx> disabled my facebook
<ctrlx> feelsgoodman.jpg
<TrollightSparkle> Oh hey ctrlx
<ctrlx> feels better than leaving myspace
<TrollightSparkle> Myspace sucked IMO
*Natleyn hugs ctrlx
<ctrlx> Natleyn, \:3/
<ctrlx> myspace was alright in the beginning
<ctrlx> but went all shitty then facebook came up since it wasn't shit
<ctrlx> now that's going all shitty
<herospirit> Hey.
<Natleyn> I'd leave facebook, but its how I keep in contact with people.
<herospirit> Hey Natleyn.
<herospirit> Hey hey Natleyn.
*Natleyn hugs herospirit
<TrollightSparkle> I just hate the status whores on both.
<herospirit> Guess what Nat.
<Natleyn> Whats up?
<herospirit> YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD
<herospirit> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz4G7UVhLos&feature=related
*herospirit flees
<ctrlx> Natleyn, i'm just gonna use g+ from now on. people will switch over if they really want to. otherwise i have contact of everyone i need through other channels
<Natleyn> >you're already dead
<ctrlx> irc. xfire. etc
<Natleyn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_ezbMQh3oI
<Natleyn> I have G+ too, but nobody wants to friggin' move.
<herospirit> Dat Blazblue
<Natleyn> I play Tao.
<Natleyn> <3
<herospirit> I only have the first one, and it's the psp version :[
<Natleyn> Well, I used to, before my psp died. :C
<Natleyn> Well, it's as good as dead.
<TrollightSparkle> What is G+ btw? Just another social network thing?
<Natleyn> Google+.
<herospirit> It's already dead.
<Natleyn> Google's facebook, except better, imo.
<Natleyn> I have my professional account on there >_>
<TrollightSparkle> Oh ok
<ctrlx> it's not dead
<ctrlx> just new
<ctrlx> even so, it still works 1000x better
<Natleyn> ctrlx: How? I've heard so many people complain about facebook, but I never hear specifics
<ctrlx> Natleyn, how what?
<ctrlx> facebook is so buggy
<Natleyn> Why facebook sucks/g+ is better
<ctrlx> and they change so much stuff around all the time and shit
<ctrlx> g+ is all like
<ctrlx> smooth
<Natleyn> I've never had any problems aside from the occasional upload messup.
<ctrlx> and the app WORKS
<Natleyn> ^THIS.
<ctrlx> facebook app never worked
<Natleyn> Well,it'd be more important to me if I had a phone that used apps.
<ctrlx> mobile site was extreamly limited as well
<ctrlx> it's google so it makes sense that the android app works
<ctrlx> but facebook has no excuse for updating an app that broke it
<ctrlx> then taking a month to fix it

<herospirit> I AM SUCCESSFULL TROLL.
<Natleyn|LurkMode> brb, seapony text tone
<TrollightSparkle> Yes. I did, that was a grammatical mistake. You're not supposed to capitalize anything that isn't a name or a place.
<herospirit> Successful Troll is my name
<herospirit> Trolling is my game
<SuccessfulTroll> You were saying?
<herospirit> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

<Razyn> Everypony!
<Razyn> Only three more days until Season 2 conclusion!
<Sumica> Evening/morning all.
<Sumica> Lo Wrek
<MeteorVenture> cutie mark crusaders junior detective league! http://www.wallpaperpimper.com/wallpaper/Kids/Case_Closed/Case-Closed-Private-Eye-1-1280x1024.jpg
<MeteorVenture> would be nice to have a crossover of that
<Sumica> lol I remember when [as] had taht show. It was short lived.
<MeteorVenture> ya me and my sister and brother used to watch that on AS
<MeteorVenture> and apparently sometimes my even younger brother.. despite being relatively young myself
<MeteorVenture> great show!
<Sumica> Crazy long show. 1k plus eps IIRC.
<MeteorVenture> i think it got over 600 not all that long ago
<MeteorVenture> but i plan on watching all the episodes for sure.. i marathon'd the whole dub of it (130 eps) over the course of a week or something probably
<MeteorVenture> would have been faster but me and my brother decided to watch the last 50 or something together
<Sumica> well counting oav's and such and the 17movies.
<Sumica> guess not a thousand but still long as hell.
<MeteorVenture> ya lol
<Sumica> *headdesk* another gundam.
<Sumica> Gundam AGE coming in october.
<Sumica> looks like they are going retro again.
<MeteorVenture> i never got into gundam so i never had to get out :D
<Sumica> Not a big fan of it but rather liked double 0
<Sumica> we will end war by actavly attacking any one engaging in war
<MeteorVenture> we could also end war by destroying all life
<Sumica> no kill like overkill
<Sumica> now all this talk of overkill I want to go watch gunbuster.
<MeteorVenture> lol
<Sumica> bleh I realy need to sort my external drive one of these days.
<MeteorVenture> lol me too kinda
<Sumica> find out if I am missing any eps and get them all in the same folders based on show.
<Sumica> get rid of LQ versions of shwos if I have HQ
<MeteorVenture> and then in folders based on season
<Sumica> dont run in to that too much with anime.
<MeteorVenture> ya
<Sumica> 13-26 eps and taht is it.
<MeteorVenture> usually so
<Sumica> some may have a second later on but they always change the name.
<Sumica> nanoha and FMP for example.
<Sumica> or the second comes so later down the road it's damn near a new show. the 15 year or so gap between gunbuster one and two.
<MeteorVenture> full metal panic turned into full metal gear alchemist in the shell
<Sumica> lol
<Sumica> yeah the overdrive thing was a bit much
<MeteorVenture> i actually have no idea about FMP
<MeteorVenture> what changed?
<Sumica> ah well he got a case of the emos
<MeteorVenture> he?
<Sumica> yeah soskay (sp) lasted most of TSR till Kana kicked some sence in to him t
<Sumica> Might try and show some eps asuming the powers taht be are cool with it and well I get some time off work.
<Sumica> 8 days in a row ending in a plated dinner for 25000 is fffffffffun
<MeteorVenture> plated dinners sound hard to eat
<MeteorVenture> like a tank
<Sumica> yes you must attack the weakspot when it glows to get at your steak.
<MeteorVenture> lol
<Sumica> We have buffet dinners and plated dinners.
<Sumica> buffet is easy as we just put all the food in warmer pans and it's help your self.
<Sumica> platted is as it sounds, presented on plats sit down dinner style.
<Sumica> 25000 dinners is going to be insane.
<MeteorVenture> wow
<MeteorVenture> i wasn't sure what you meant by dinner for 25000
<MeteorVenture> i was thinking $25000
<MeteorVenture> like you're eating gold bars or something lol
<Sumica> lol
<MeteorVenture> now think of having that much money in $1 bills
<MeteorVenture> and then think of those bills being people who all want a plate of dinner
<Sumica> so that comes to roughly 150 tons of cow we have to cook plate, and serv
<Sumica> party is gonna be spread out over 3 floors in the banuet halls
<MeteorVenture> lol DANG
<Sumica> sure we are charging them an arm and a leg for it all too.
<Sumica> probably around 30 bucks a plate
<Sumica> lord knows what the rentalcost is.
<MeteorVenture> so that's like 750k.. gosh
<MeteorVenture> for plates
<MeteorVenture> if someone took all the earnings and left they would be rich
<MeteorVenture> which gives me an idea.. where is this being held?
<MeteorVenture> i'm going to defend the place and regain my honor!
<Sumica> lol
<Sumica> Vegas of corse
<MeteorVenture> lol alright i guess i should have known
<Sumica> besides I am sure they already payed.
<MeteorVenture> well that's vegas.. paying for stuff before getting it and hoping nothing goes wrong
<MeteorVenture> not that i would really know:P
<Sumica> more or less.
<Sumica> Here have some old giant robot action.
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHXS2_NV4-0&feature=related
<MeteorVenture> starts out with passionately yelling women.. that's pretty oldschool
<MeteorVenture> although that still happens all the tim
<MeteorVenture> time*
<MeteorVenture> as if their yelling makes the machines stronger
<Sumica> She was't all super powerd or heroic and sucked at everything so the yelling was a mantra or some such.
<MeteorVenture> though i haven't seen it so for all i know it could
<Sumica> Shame YT seems to have nuked the subtitles on like everything again.
<MeteorVenture> with all that we've imagined the reality of this night is sure to make this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-LIPFgMcVA
<LordCelestia> Is anyone online this early?
<LordCelestia> I guess not. haha
<MeteorVenture> i am
<MeteorVenture> just weighing out my options.. wondering how i'm gonna waste the day away
<LordCelestia> hey is anyone online?
<LordCelestia> its like 6 in the morning here
<LordCelestia> nevermind
<LordCelestia> byea
<MeteorVenture> i just said iwas
<MeteorVenture> D:
<MeteorVenture> well take care i guess
*Dumori yawns
<Dumori> lonesome road was fun but now theres my day
<Dumori> gone
<Dumori> sweet sweet FA to do
<MeteorVenture> i never see fan art shortened like that
<MeteorVenture> my mind jumped to fur affinity.. lol
<MeteorVenture> i don't even go to fur affinity
<MantisToboggan> soo
<MantisToboggan> when's the discord shipping fics gonna start pouring in
<MantisToboggan> what's the ETA on that
<MeteorVenture> i think that's already started
<MeteorVenture> well dunno about fics
<Dumori> fyi FA tends to mean fuck all
<MantisToboggan> yeah i've seen pictures with discord and pinkie, but just innocent one's since i stay away from the r34 stuff
<Dumori> yeah I'm quite sure I've seen DicordX fics
<Dumori> or pople saying they've started one
<MantisToboggan> what a world
<Dumori> yeah
<MantisToboggan> which reminds me, discord x steven magnet shipping
<Dumori> x3
<Dumori> I need to hit my FLGS
<MeteorVenture> ya i avoid R34 too so idk about that stuff.. and i rather like to keep on not knowing
<Dumori> I think Black Curasade and Unhallowed Metropolis Revised are in.
<Dumori> r34 gideline there is
<Dumori> x3
<Dumori> really I've hardly ever been surpised at a missing r34 content
<MeteorVenture> not sure exactly what you mean there
<Dumori> there tends to be pretty much any r34 you can think of in existance
<Dumori> I'm sure some artiest just dedicate them sleves to making rule 34 true...
<MeteorVenture> oh ya i wouldn't doubt that at all.. i'm sure it's turned into some sort of game
<Dumori> what how long dose it take a .pdf to get on the net its been up for sale for a good 3 weeks
<Dumori> I don't want to shell out £15 on the pdf when I'm buying the book for £30 odd too
<MeteorVenture> if i was an artist into that sort of thing i'm sure i would enjoy making stuff like that
<MeteorVenture> but i'm not and that's sick
<MantisToboggan> it just makes me sad
<MantisToboggan> i guess it makes sense a lot of furries are into MLP
<MantisToboggan> and in the internet, there are A LOT of furries
<Dumori> aye
<Dumori> wait theres an RPG called Leaverage
<Dumori> LAWL
<MeteorVenture> lol idk why furries being into MLP makes you sad
<MantisToboggan> no the existance of MLP r34 is what makes me sad
<MeteorVenture> ah ya ok
<Dumori> r24 is for EVERY thing
<Dumori> 34**
<MantisToboggan> i stay away so it doesn't REALLY bother me but
<Dumori> really
<Dumori> just stay away
<Dumori> if it makes one sad
<MantisToboggan> i've never been this closely connected to the fans of that stuff
<MantisToboggan> i don't like anime
<Dumori> but it will exist for anything
<MantisToboggan> i don't watch new animated movies
<MeteorVenture> don't like anime? D:
<MeteorVenture> if you like animation of any sort then you are almost certainly missing out
<MantisToboggan> eh not really
<MantisToboggan> i've seen plenty
<MantisToboggan> i've enjoyed some
<MantisToboggan> still not a fan
<MeteorVenture> like.. bleach/naruto/one piece?
<MeteorVenture> those are some of the most famous ones.. not the best though
<MantisToboggan> like death note, berserk, cowboy bebop
<MantisToboggan> and uh
<MantisToboggan> hellsing
<MantisToboggan> those are some that i enjoyed parts of
<MantisToboggan> but overall i'd rather watch something else
<MantisToboggan> and vast majority of what i see is total garbage that i think you have to just be really into the whole animation thing
<MantisToboggan> in short i'm not a fan, liked some stuff, hated most, don't go out of my way to watch more
<MeteorVenture> ok.. death note.. well if you still don't like anime after seeing things like death note/fruits basket/gurren lagann.. or something then i guess lol
<MeteorVenture> well i don't like alot of the more famous anime.. that's why i avoid them and watch the ones that i think i will like and usually i can tell based on the cover art and the summary if i will like it or not
<MeteorVenture> so i really don't have much experience with bad anime shows
<MeteorVenture> that said i've never seen any you listed except death note but i know of them
<Dumori> Ainme is too varryied to really say it's all crap
<Dumori> imho any how
<Dumori> it would be live saying liveaction is crap
<MeteorVenture> ya that's what i'm sayin
<Dumori> though I guess it has an added language/culture barrier
<MeteorVenture> you gotta really be opposed to animation in general to dislike it
<Dumori> I wouldn;t know
<Dumori> spent a chunk of early childhood in Japan
<MeteorVenture> cool
<MeteorVenture> i've never been there but i wanna go
<Dumori> still can't read japanese any more
<Dumori> x3
<Dumori> I'm sure I must have been able to once
<Dumori> but I've totaly forgotten most of the lnaguage
<Dumori> I can get the jist of it some times
<Dumori> and I knwo the odd word
<Dumori> really no soild help
<MeteorVenture> k.. lol dunno what else to say
<Dumori> lol
<MeteorVenture> btw i actually might not have heard of berserk
<Dumori> Berserk be huge
<Dumori> IIRC
<MeteorVenture> i am thinking.. super bloody anime
<Dumori> but I've not seen much
<MeteorVenture> dude with super huge eyebrows
<Dumori> Rings bells
<MeteorVenture> but google images isn't helping
<Dumori> is deff heavily violent
<MeteorVenture> then i'm sure it's what i'm thinking of
<Dumori> Guts ring a beel
<Dumori> bell is the mains name
<Dumori> also cool 2012 brings a new anime
<Dumori> of films aiming to cover the full manga
<Dumori> This web radio sation feels like avery DJ on it's libary on shuffle...
<Dumori> I can't say it's bad
<Dumori> but it sure is swaping tone fast
<Dumori> is on AutoDJ atm
<MeteorVenture> anyway mantis if you don't want to watch anime that's alright but i don't really see why you wouldn't like it as a whole since it has a huge variety.. i don't even watch anime for the fandoms.. i watch anime and hardly ever touch their fandoms
<Dumori> aye
<Dumori> the only Fandom to grab me was Hellsing
<Dumori> Manga and OVA
<Dumori> the orginal anime is ok but really off track form the manga
<MeteorVenture> the most i see of fandoms is when i have to watch a show on youtube lol
<MeteorVenture> ironic..
<Dumori> lol
<Dumori> I have just seen DDR controled Tetres
<Dumori> I can die complet now
<Dumori> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAZdgTVhzsI
<Dumori> well not really I have some other things to tie up
<Dumori> and also MLP needs to stop airing
<MeteorVenture> fandoms don't really interest me unless they have a reason to.. bronies for instance are just that awesome.. they interest me alot.. other fandoms are not so interesting since i'm not following anything with them i guess
<Dumori> Bronies I've not met one I hate
<MeteorVenture> and i just don't see how they could be as awesome as bronies
<Dumori> and I've meant soem I should hate...
<MeteorVenture> you shouldn't hate anyone
<MeteorVenture> lol
<Dumori> I have self lothing still but FiM stole all my other hate
<MeteorVenture> i don't really understand self-loathing
<Dumori> the most importent part is having reasons
<MeteorVenture> well i think i have PLENTY
<Dumori> lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15ohay ponies
<Dumori> Hey
<MeteorVenture> i mean i have felt like i wanted to go die in a hole before.. i mean i think i have.. i'm pretty sure i've said so at least.. but that wasn't cause i hated myself.. that was actually just something i wanted to do
<MeteorVenture> because i hated what i did
<Dumori> yeah
<Dumori> then all you need is to hate yourself for doing that
<MeteorVenture> i don't think it's good to hate yourself.. you can hate what you did but there's no changing it now and hating yourself won't solve anything.. and if you're using it as an excuse to keep doing nothing then stop it
<MeteorVenture> i mean if you're using it as an excuse to keep doing whatever you hate doing then i could see the interest in self-loathing
<Dumori> nah
*Dermathil opens his bottle of pepsi Max and tastes it for the very first time.
<Dumori> first time with pepis max
<Dumori> it's ok
<MeteorVenture> k well i can totally see people doing that.. hating themselves because they feel better about what they're doing
<Dumori> the drink makes me go batt shit hyper though
<MeteorVenture> or rather so they can feel better about it
*Dermathil grunts and WAVES, saying good morning.
<Dumori> hey
<Dumori> afternoon to you
<Dermathil> hehehehe
<MeteorVenture> i just wish people could admit their problems.. and if they still want to do whatever they're doing that's wrong go ahead but don't hide it or try to justify it.. just admit it
<Dumori> ah
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh goddammit.... now I'll be busy for the next couple of weeks... http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/baldurs-gate-pony-mod.html
<MeteorVenture> i guess i'll quit rambling on now lol unless yall actually like to hear what i have to say.. relevant or not
<Dumori> yeah I saw that RobotPinkie
<Dumori> x3
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That's srsly awesome.
<Dumori> enjoy hearing but I need to head out and "waste" money
<Dumori> yup
<MeteorVenture> lol alright
<MeteorVenture> take care!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15later Dumori, I guess
<MeteorVenture> nice talking with you
<Dermathil> hey RobotPinkie
<Dumori> got some RPG books to buy and gush over
<RobotPinkie> 06,15'sup Dermathil
<Dumori> should keep me going to new pony day
<Dumori> see you all alter
<MeteorVenture> haha ohhhh yes.. i know what you mean.. although i don't do that myself:P
<Dermathil> testing pepsi max out at 8:30 in the morning...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I have a ton of RPG books... more than is healthy...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15The best time to test out caffeinated beverages is in the morning, so...
<Dermathil> just before class?
<Dermathil> Oh, and I'd still do it at 11PM.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, I think so...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That's when I need caffeine the most, anyway
<Dermathil> hehehehehe
*Dermathil still has to thank NewDCD for the linkies for the two TTGL movie downloads.
<DashWithRainbows> hey guys
<MeteorVenture> speaking of which.. procrastination.. that's an annoying concept to me.. if you procrastinate and still worry about actually doing the work then you should actually do the work.. worrying about it does nothing.. so either decide early on to not do it and save the stress or do it and be done with it
<Dermathil> MeteorVenture, that's not how it works.
<Dermathil> First, you want to do it, but you can't be arsed since you're bored. So you say you'll do it on the next day. Then it goes on until the very last day.
<MeteorVenture> well i mean if in the end you actually don't do it
<DashWithRainbows> that made completly no sense to me MeteorVenture
<Dermathil> MeteorVenture, half the time people does it at the very end.
<MeteorVenture> you put it off until you don't do it.. that sort of thing
<Dermathil> Because they want to have the fun they could have after BEFORE doing it.
<MeteorVenture> not like putting it off till you actually do it at the last minute
*Trollestia doesn't think I'll go hunting today.
<Trollestia> ARARCHY IN THE MIDWEST
<Trollestia> anarchy
<Dermathil> meteorventure, doing it at the last minute is EXACTLY what procrastination is.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I wanna be the very best, like no one ever was.
<Dermathil> You push it back 'til the last minute.
<Dermathil> POKEMON!!
<DashWithRainbows> i will not sing that theme again...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15To catch them is my real test, to train them is my caaaaause
<Dermathil> GOTTA CATCH EM' ALL!
<MeteorVenture> listen.. i've procrastinated before.. i worried about doing it all along.. and at the last moment i realized it was not worth it to actually do it.. i much rather not do it
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I will travel across the land, searching far and wide
<DashWithRainbows> do what exactly? some essay of some sort?
<Dermathil> MeteorVenture: you listen. I'm probably the biggest procrastinating bastard in the entire chat. I should know, I've recieved dozens of detentions because of it.
<MeteorVenture> i did that plenty of times till i realized it's INCREDIBLY stupid.. even if smart people can do it too lol
<Dermathil> Due to incomplete works.
<DashWithRainbows> oh
<RobotPinkie> 06,15each pokemon to understand, the power that's insiiiiiide
<RobotPinkie> 06,15POKEMON!
<DashWithRainbows> trust me,
<DashWithRainbows> i have been detention tonnes of times for no homework/late coursework
<Dermathil> ¨¨
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ouch, probably a good plan to not procrastinate then
<DashWithRainbows> but sixth form is easier as i have only 1 subject to do.
<DashWithRainbows> and around 18/30 of my lessons are empty i do the homework then
<Dermathil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux8mJUexBcM
<MeteorVenture> well either way i mean if you don't think you'll do it in the end.. just skip it and save the mental trouble.. if you think you will then do it.. but whatever you do DON'T worry about it until it passes over as you smile uneasily at it so you can feel better about yourself later
<Dermathil> MeteorVenture, I don't wanna do it NOW, that's the important thing. I wanna do it LATER.
<MeteorVenture> lol i know
<Dermathil> that's what the concept of procrastination revolves around.
<MeteorVenture> i know how it works.. but you need to eventually actually do it for it to work
<Dermathil> Kind-of putting it as priority 2 and always moving something else in the priority 1 slot.
<Dermathil> I know
<Dermathil> that's what the last minute is for
<DashWithRainbows> yep...
<MeteorVenture> i'm saying if at the last minute you resolve not to do it.. you could probably tell from the beginning that you would do that.. at least i know i can
<MeteorVenture> i know myself better than that.. i know whether i'm gonna do something or not
<MeteorVenture> so if i know i'm not going to it's best to decide that at the start
<Dermathil> MeteorVenture, most people can't actually tell from the beginning, and that's what the concept of procrastination is the result of.
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey guys
<MeteorVenture> k.. well it's most likely cause they don't try
<DashWithRainbows> hey LunaTheForgotten
<Dermathil> >they don't try
<Dermathil> what the hell are you saying right now?
<Dermathil> you don't have the whole picture to say that.
<MeteorVenture> it's not tough.. in the end it's alot better
<Dermathil> MeteorVenture, maybe for you, but not for everybody else.
<MeteorVenture> i'm saying most likely
<Dermathil> don't use most likely, because you have no proof that it is actually the case. Use maybe instead.
<MeteorVenture> and you can't tell me i don't know what i'm talking about cause you don't know what i'm talking about
<Dermathil> You are talking about the fact that they don't try to figure out early on whether they will do work or not later on.
<DashWithRainbows> im finding this argument very interesting...
<Dermathil> So yeah, I do know.
<MeteorVenture> lol no you don't
<LunaTheForgotten> Dash,So am I
<Dermathil> Then mind clarifying your points, then? Explain?
<DashWithRainbows> mostly because it sort of describes what i used to be like
<MeteorVenture> i was not talking about that.. i was talking about they don't try to learn themselves well enough
<MeteorVenture> first of all you should know yourself.. your history
<MeteorVenture> you should pay attention
<MeteorVenture> if you do it every time you're going to do it again
<Dermathil> MeteorVenture, that's called being torn apart between having FUN and doing the work.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15YOU ARE TEARING ME APART, LISA!
<MeteorVenture> i don't know what you mean
<Dermathil> thanks, RobotPinkie.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You're welcome.
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey RobotPinkie
<MeteorVenture> how does reviewing your history stop the fun? it actually makes things funner when you realize you're not going to do it anyway and you just skip the whole thing and don't worry about it
<Dermathil> MeteorVenture: that's meaning you are having a hard time choosing whether you want to have fun first and do it later and doing the work then.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I think the entire argument is a bit silly, but go on.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Hey LunaTheForgotten :)
<Dermathil> RobotPinkie: just trying to clear some stuff up with Meteor.
<DashWithRainbows> both me and LunaTheForgotten find this argument interesting....
<LunaTheForgotten> We do.
<MeteorVenture> i should talk about controversial stuff i know 100% without a doubt more often
<MeteorVenture> :P
<Dermathil> MeteorVenture: then that's not procrastination. Not at all.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Certainty is always more fun when you're wrong. :P
<MeteorVenture> i'm joking around of course..
<RobotPinkie> 06,15trolololo
<Dermathil> Like I said already, procrastination revolves around the uncertainty.
<Dermathil> So if you know, then you are not procrastinating.
<MeteorVenture> exactly though.. i'm saying that procrastination is not very smart
<MeteorVenture> and that you should do something smart
<Dermathil> MeteorVenture, you are basically insulting a big bunch of people by using these terms. Maybe they don't know, but you do in their backs right now.
<Dermathil> What I'm trying to say is that Not everyone is as "perfect" as you.
<MeteorVenture> i did clarify earlier that even smart people can do dumb things
<Dermathil> Most people have a much harder time deciding between the sensations that fun gives and the boredom that work gives.
<DashWithRainbows> has the chats layout changed for anyone else or is it just me?...
<Dermathil> nope, Dash.
<LunaTheForgotten> It's the same for me.
<MeteorVenture> i realize that.. also i was not meaning to say anyone was dumb.. just cause something someone does is dumb doesn't mean they are
<Dermathil> Always been like that.
<DashWithRainbows> must be this school computer then
<LunaTheForgotten> God, I love homeschool.
<DashWithRainbows> somewhat lucky LunaTheForgotten
<LunaTheForgotten> :)
<MeteorVenture> i was homeschooled.. glad i was too.. but eventually i realized i didn't like school altogether
<MeteorVenture> jk that was apparent from the start:P
<DashWithRainbows> at some points i wish i was home schooled but then i wouldnt have as much of a social life...
<MeteorVenture> but i still much prefer homeschooling
<DashWithRainbows> but in all fairness i would like to of been homeschooled
<LunaTheForgotten> I wasn't homeschooled till the 7 grade though
<LunaTheForgotten> So I got that social interaction
<DashWithRainbows> i dont really get the difference oif USA's schools 7th grade and Year 7 here in the UK
*Dermathil is happy he ended that infernal debate.
<LunaTheForgotten> Idk, I'm in the USA
<MeteorVenture> i was homeschooled all after kindergarten.. i basically quit before the 5th grade though.. the work piled up and such.. not that i couldn't do it though.. it was just exceptionally boring and unchallenging at that.. so i skipped right to the GED and passed that with flying colors
<DashWithRainbows> i think that the age of 7th grade is the minimal age of year 6
*Dermathil was in public school in elementary school
*Dermathil went to private institution for high school.
<DashWithRainbows> in all fairness i most likely would of been better if i was living in USA
<LunaTheForgotten> I started 7th grade at 12 but turned 13 during the year.
<LunaTheForgotten> My brothers went to private school for highschool.
*Dermathil misses the days back when there was only 12 people in chat until 3PM
<DashWithRainbows> its 2pm over here...
<LunaTheForgotten> It's 9am here
<DashWithRainbows> probably around 9 for you
<MeteorVenture> i went to church for my social interactivities
<LunaTheForgotten> So do I
*Dermathil mumbles something about churches...
*DashWithRainbows only went to church for family weddings and christenings
<DashWithRainbows> hated it...
<Trollestia> lol, church
*LunaTheForgotten plays in church band.
<MeteorVenture> christenings? not really familiar with that term tbh
*Dermathil lives in a place where the younger generations don't give squat to religion.
<Dermathil> (half a century ago they controlled the school and the lives of everybody, basically)
<Dermathil> (people eventually decided that it was time to change)
<LunaTheForgotten> Shut it Dermathil.
<DashWithRainbows> i have mixed opinions of religion...
<Dermathil> LunaTheForgotten, I am talking about what they did where I live.
<MeteorVenture> i'm a christian
<LunaTheForgotten> Where do you live?
<MeteorVenture> alabama
<Dermathil> Province of Quebec, Canada.
<LunaTheForgotten> Oh........Sorry.
<DashWithRainbows> i believe there is an after life (mostly because of karma) and that there is a creator and thats it really...
<LunaTheForgotten> I live in Georgia though
<MeteorVenture> to me it's not enough to think there's a creator.. i want to know him personally
<LunaTheForgotten> MeteorVenture, True dat
<MeteorVenture> *brohoof*
<Dermathil> Personally, I don't believe in things that have no irrefutable proof of it. I pretty much observe and study. I prefer to believe in things that I can find proof that exists.
<DashWithRainbows> i hope that the "after life" is a choice e.g. live as a different person/animal from birth or go to your personal heaven
*Trollestia has stolen, kills most days, and has never regularly gone to church. Sue me.
*LunaTheForgotten accepts brohoof
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Confound these telephones, they drive me to answering them.
<Dermathil> DashWithRainbows: you be buddhist?
<DashWithRainbows> no...
<LunaTheForgotten> I don't want to be a animal!!
<LunaTheForgotten> brb
<DashWithRainbows> i just like some of their ideas mixed in from other religions
<MeteorVenture> i don't really think proof is something you can have.. i think there's plenty of foolish things to believe or not believe though
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, I hope that when you die, you can choose to live as a pony in Equestria.
<Dermathil> Dash, the concept of buddhism is that you will be reborn until you achieve perfection, upon which you will ascend to the afterlife.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I think this is fairly likely, tbh
<MeteorVenture> i think enough evidence is good enough if it lines up right with everything else
<Trollestia> RobotPinkie wins, topic closed.
<DashWithRainbows> thats what my personal heaven would be RobotPinkie, now like Trollestia said, topic closed
<DashWithRainbows> now what shall we discuss??
<MeteorVenture> mods always win >.>
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, no need to close the topic for that, religion is interesting.
<LunaTheForgotten> and I'm back
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Just don't... y'know... troll about it...
*Trollestia doesn't know who's a mod and who isn't.
*Dermathil would love if RobotPinkie was right, but is pretty sure it actually is like a dreamless sleep where you see/feel/hear nothing, where you can't think or even react to anything.
<LunaTheForgotten> Guys, I have to go to tennis
<LunaTheForgotten> I'll seee you later
*Dermathil thinks the afterlife is an actual state of lack of live.
<Dermathil> *life
<MeteorVenture> alright take care luna:D
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Later, LunaTheForgotten
<Dermathil> cya Forgotten one
<Trollestia> Being dead is probably nothing. If it isn't, all the better.
<DashWithRainbows> bye LunaTheForgotten !
*Trollestia isn't about to worry about it in the meantime.
<Dermathil> Trollestia knows my philosophy well.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pretty much. If you're just gone, there's no cause for worrying about it. If not, well hey, cool.
<Dermathil> Better do what you want now instead of hoping that you can still do it in the afterlife.
<LunaTheForgotton> one more thing
<LunaTheForgotton> Are they streaming anything today
<MeteorVenture> idk why people think going to church has anything to do with being christian.. sure that's something to do but it's not extremely important.. some places don't even have church.. i just think that saying that you don't go to church regularly doesn't really say anything
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Don't think so... might link to my synchtube later if nothing's going on...
<DashWithRainbows> i dont think so LunaTheForgotton
<MeteorVenture> had to mention..
<DashWithRainbows> my home laptop's screen is absolutly fucked right now...
<Trollestia> I don't kill randomly, I only take what I need. I thank my kills for the food, but that's mostly an old habit.
<MeteorVenture> that's nice i suppose
<DashWithRainbows> when you kill someone/something, be polite...
<MeteorVenture> reminds me of avatar lol
<Trollestia> Yeah. They at least deserver that.
<DashWithRainbows> brb, need to sign a piece of paper to say im on this computer....
<Trollestia> *deserve
<RobotPinkie> 06,15plz don't eat ponies :(
<Trollestia> Horses are worth more alive than dead, of course.
<MeteorVenture> i don't really kill animals but when i do.. i know they don't have any idea what i'm saying :yaoming:
<Trollestia> As for a *pony* pony, I wouldn't touch them.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well ponies aren't exactly horses, yeah...
<MeteorVenture> again.. just joking around
<MeteorVenture> i think animals should be treated with respect.. no killing for sport.. but they're still animals and perfectly fine to eat
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I pretty much agree with that, though I try to avoid eating once living things that aren't fish.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Mostly for health reasons, though...
<MeteorVenture> even hamburger meat? whatever that stuff is made of?
<MeteorVenture> oh ok
<DashWithRainbows> ok im back
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That's just cardboard and compost, perfectly fine to eat :P
<MeteorVenture> still better sounding than candy
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Nah I do eat hamburgers on occasion, I just try to not overdo it.
<MeteorVenture> i like stuff like hamburger helper
<DashWithRainbows> meh, i dont really enjoy hamburgers often...
<MeteorVenture> hamburgers are alright.. but when i eat those it's chicken sandwiches
<MeteorVenture> usually
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Chicken is delicious
<DashWithRainbows> what meats do you guys actually eat anyways??
<DashWithRainbows> i so agree with you RobotPinkie
<Trollestia> Whatever I hunt.
<MeteorVenture> KFC is awesome
<Trollestia> I very rarely buy food.
<Trollestia> Well, besides cola and such things.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I eat sheep from the farm, on occasion.
<DashWithRainbows> for me in order from best to i like - Chicken, Turkey, Galmon, Beef
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Really delicious meat.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15What's it called again? Mutton?
<MeteorVenture> i just thought about eating the pound puppies
<DashWithRainbows> i think so....
<MeteorVenture> cause of mutton
<Trollestia> Ew, cotton.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Secret mutt fun
<DashWithRainbows> i see what you did there....
<RobotPinkie> 06,15...I sincerely apologize...
<DashWithRainbows> but srsly the spam when that Ad shows...
<MeteorVenture> we need a pound puppies stream
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I dunno about that, I've never seen it.
<DashWithRainbows> i have only heard of it because of the advert
<DashWithRainbows> even then it sounds terrible...
<MeteorVenture> but daniel ingram
<RobotPinkie> 06,15He makes music for it?
<MeteorVenture> i believe so
<DashWithRainbows> just curious, who is Daniel Ingram?
<MeteorVenture> and martha speaks (which i thought was really dang funny when me and my brother watched it while flipping around channels a LONG time ago)
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh, yeah, IMDB confirms it
<MeteorVenture> the dude who makes the songs in MLP
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, what he said :P
<MeteorVenture> the background music is someone else though.. i think will anderson
<DashWithRainbows> im trying to find a good download of the background music as well as the songs...
<MeteorVenture> i've been following daniel's fb page
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Wow, he has almost 8000 fans on facebook now...
<MeteorVenture> since before the huge boost in likes *hipster*
<DashWithRainbows> better make it one more closer to 8000 later then...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pffft
<RobotPinkie> 06,15and yeah, you should :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I just love the songs he's done for FiM
<MeteorVenture> gotta love when he decides to ask for something with an exchange of unreleased music
<DashWithRainbows> obvious as they are really awesome RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> 06,15so many awesome remixes on YouTube, too.
<DashWithRainbows> its rare i find some PMV's i actualy like to listen to again
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, percentage wise it's not a lot that I've saved and listen to...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It's mostly PinkiePieSwear and NotACleverPony, lawl
<MeteorVenture> sitcoms are like "what is this place filled with so many one-liners?"
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I see what you did thar :P
<DashWithRainbows> like two and a half men...
<MeteorVenture> i thought of it and had to say it:P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That happens to me sometimes, too
<DashWithRainbows> yet i still liked to watch it but with Ashton as charlie i think it will go downhill.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It was pretty clever
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ashton needs to start bangin' seven gram rocks
<MeteorVenture> did someone say ash? http://i1216.photobucket.com/albums/dd377/volt28/memes-dat-ash-ay-girl-can-i-get-yo-digletts-Copy.jpg
<DashWithRainbows> he needs Charlies brain but he would not be able to handle it
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Did someone say Ash? http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yy6Y12nWqjU/TPfX2oKdriI/AAAAAAAAAJM/FBI5Mw9prDo/s1600/ash_boomstick.jpg
<MeteorVenture> ay gurl
<Dermathil> ASH
<Dermathil> Where's your chainsaw man?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It's out of frame, but still attached
*DashWithRainbows wishes he had his own boomstick...
<MeteorVenture> so i looked up "volcanic ash ketchum" and got this http://www.facebook.com/pages/Volcanic-Ash-Ketchum/103818199661514
*Trollestia has a few boomsticks.

<AllisZero> Morning everypony
<DashWithRainbows> that from todays nightly round up?
<DashWithRainbows> ohai AllisZero !
<RobotPinkie> 06,15mornin' AllisZero
<MeteorVenture> eh that reference to rocky was a longshot (not to be confused with hookshot)
<MeteorVenture> eh that reference to zelda was a hookshot
*DashWithRainbows never played zelda...
<MeteorVenture> (not to be confused with confusion)
*DashWithRainbows played pokemon instead
<MeteorVenture> i guess you didn't catch em all
<DashWithRainbows> caught every pokemon on every game...
<DashWithRainbows> dealwithit.jpg
<MeteorVenture> while you were trying to catch em all with pokemon i caught all big poe's
<MeteorVenture> dealwithit.jpg
<DashWithRainbows> 1. what is a big poe?
<DashWithRainbows> 2. also fit in halo series and command and conquer into childhood
<MeteorVenture> it's from zelda
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ocarina of Time
<AllisZero> >mfw this conversation
<DashWithRainbows> when i joined AllisZero
<DashWithRainbows> MeteorVenture: and Dermatill were arguing about procrastination
<DashWithRainbows> then it somewhat went into our views on religion
<AllisZero> Lol
<DashWithRainbows> then about Daniel ingram
<MeteorVenture> cause he's a religion himself
<DashWithRainbows> also forgot about meat we eat...
<MeteorVenture> :P
<DashWithRainbows> and now its about zelda/pokemon
<RobotPinkie> 06,15And now it's about what the conversation is about.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15How meta!
<MeteorVenture> and in the future it's gonna be music
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pinkie Pie is such a spoony bard. http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3QHYZYPC4Hc/TnklAcc57uI/AAAAAAAAMm8/whl7whFikIs/s1600/MLP_logo.jpg
<DashWithRainbows> >hates dubstep...
<MeteorVenture> i love dubstep.. let me explain why
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I wubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwub dubstep
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lolololol
<MeteorVenture> i wub wub wub wub woo woo woo
<DashWithRainbows> i herd u guys wub dubstep?
<DashWithRainbows> to bad im not going to post any :D
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, I like some dubtrot I've heard, anyway...
<MeteorVenture> aww no lols about what i considered to be a great pun
<MeteorVenture> lol
<MeteorVenture> so i do it myself.. because if i don't who will?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I thought I made that pun too, kinda :P
<MeteorVenture> /narrative
<DashWithRainbows> dubtrot i will most likely listen to for some off reason
<DashWithRainbows> odd*
<MeteorVenture> oh.. i totally missed the I
<MeteorVenture> great pun robot
<AllisZero> Why is Twilight always brown?
<MeteorVenture> lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol you too
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Twilight is brown?
<MeteorVenture> lol thanks.. i try:P
<AllisZero> I don't know; whenever Twi is drawn humanized, she has dark skin
<AllisZero> Never got the reasoning behind that
<DashWithRainbows> @AllisZero Cant tell if making a joke or a statement
<DashWithRainbows> oh then yeah,
<DashWithRainbows> i never understood that either..
<MeteorVenture> ok.. i think this is what happened
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh yeah... I really dunno
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I don't really see them as any specific skin color
<MeteorVenture> a person who works on the show drew humanized ponies
<MeteorVenture> twilight was black/brown/whatever
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ahh okay, that would explain it
<AllisZero> Yeah, probably
<DashWithRainbows> i dont really care for humanized ponies...
<AllisZero> YOU BREAK MY HEART
<MeteorVenture> i think there were a few people raging over that
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Me neither... I much prefer ponyized humans
<AllisZero> I'm drawing some at home
<MeteorVenture> which of course makes me lol to even think about
<DashWithRainbows> as long its not rule 34 AllisZero then i would like to see it
<MeteorVenture> i think i have it saved somewhere in my HUGE FOLDER... anyway
<MeteorVenture> or that's something else i'm thinking of
<Trollestia> http://imgur.com/gallery/nr2PZ
<AllisZero> It's not; I don't draw porn, though I'm told I'd be very good at it.
<DashWithRainbows> Trollestia: out of fucking nowhere.
<Trollestia> It's my special gift, you know.
<DashWithRainbows> your cutie mark perhaps?
<Trollestia> Nah, that's a rifle.
<MeteorVenture> not to derail.. let's talk about humanized ponies over in THAT corner
*Trollestia doesn't know how a rifle would fit on a flank, but whatever.
<DashWithRainbows> thats a good comic
<MeteorVenture> i know i lol'd
<RobotPinkie> 06,15ponified humans > humanized ponies
<DashWithRainbows> a small rifle perhaps Trollestia ?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Fact.
<Trollestia> Sure.
<DashWithRainbows> Ponies > ponified humans > humanized ponies > humans
<Trollestia> http://imgur.com/gallery/z4UcA The captions. THEY'RE IN ORDER.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ponies > everything else
<DashWithRainbows> Ponies > can divide by 0 and nothing happens
<RobotPinkie> 06,15@calc ponies / 0
<RobotPinkie> 06,15...oh, no magnets, damn
<MeteorVenture> OH GOSH.. ponified version of these characters http://www.rpgbrasil.org/loja/img/p/369-415-large.jpg http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QdO-bweEo4s/TSOfXUkW-ZI/AAAAAAAAAhQ/xJ4KmKfxsgk/s1600/aishiteru-ze-baby.jpg

<DashWithRainbows> ponified hello kitty?
<MeteorVenture> lololololololllololololololololololoolooolollolo.. i keep loling guys but it isn't working as well as it used to
<DashWithRainbows> how about ponified game characters?
<Trollestia> "The A-10, when you absolutely, positively have to kill every motherfucker in your AO"
<Trollestia> -caption on an image of said plane
<MeteorVenture> ok well actually i am quite serious.. i would like to see those chars ponified
<Trollestia> Warthog <3
<MeteorVenture> also sorry for whoever got the reference lol
<MeteorVenture> had to do it
<DashWithRainbows> anyways i gotta sign off as it the end of school, might come on later after some Xbox time
<DashWithRainbows> anyways bye!
<MeteorVenture> alright take care:D
<DashWithRainbows> great about to leave an DCD comes on....
<DashWithRainbows> o well
<Trollestia> Anypony else a fan of Ace Combat?
<MeteorVenture> btw i just realized i botched that joke back there.. it should have been "why wubwubwubwubwubwubwoowoowoo" or something
<NewDCD> 9>Ace Combat
<NewDCD> 9GOOD LUCK
<NewDCD> 9DEMON LORD OF THE ROUND TABLE
<NewDCD> 9I MEAN
<NewDCD> 9MOBIUS ONE
<NewDCD> 9I MEAN
<AllisZero> Wow, I fucked up bad.
<NewDCD> 9RAZGRIZ SQUADRON
<NewDCD> 9I MEAN
<NewDCD> 9GRYPHUS ONE
<AllisZero> This sucks.
<NewDCD> 9I MEAN
<NewDCD> 9ANTARES
<NewDCD> 9I MEAN
<NewDCD> 9STFS SCARFACE
<NewDCD> 9I MEAN
<NewDCD> 9NEMO
<Trollestia> RAZGRIZ SQUADRON IS BEST SQUADRON
<NewDCD> 9does that answer your question?
<Trollestia> THAT IS ALL
<NewDCD> 9fuck yes 5 was my fave
<MeteorVenture> what's wrong allis?
<Trollestia> Five is my favourite, but Zero was awesome as well.
<AllisZero> Made some changes to our default routes, which fucked up a bunch of required batch jobs
<NewDCD> 9same here
<NewDCD> 9I haven't played six tho'
<MeteorVenture> i played six.. on guitar hero 2
<AllisZero> Essentially I sent all traffic to an interface that couldn't receive it :P
<MeteorVenture> that sucks
<AllisZero> Eh, minor setback for some people
<Trollestia> Also, the Su-37 doesn't get the credit it deserves.
<AllisZero> But a huge benefit to everyone else
<AllisZero> Still, I hate making mistakes
<MeteorVenture> btw interface is still too technical for some people btw:P
<Trollestia> Not that any of them compare to the plane with a frickin' laser beam, though.
<NewDCD> 9even so, I made this Trollestia http://time-diver.deviantart.com/art/Obscure-Placeholder-Joke-189026292
<AllisZero> Luna!
<MeteorVenture> btw i used btw twice btw
*Trollestia salutes.
<Trollestia> "~Kydure Feb 24, 2011
<Trollestia> Fox two fox two"
<Trollestia> lmao
<NewDCD> 9which reminds me
<NewDCD> 9I once drew a Pony of Razgriz
<NewDCD> 9but I've lost it and all that remains of it is a terribad quality cam photo
<NewDCD> 9do you still want it?
<Trollestia> Sure.
*Luna waves at everypony
<Trollestia> http://imgur.com/gallery/kYVYK Truth.
<MeteorVenture> gotta fix those bugs gotta pay that rent
<MeteorVenture> oh gosh i talk in references
<NewDCD> 9I suck at drawing ponies http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/2488/fixedrazgriz.jpg
<MeteorVenture> mysteriousfinger.jpg
<Trollestia> Where's the ludicrously overpowered weaponry?
<Trollestia> Nice, though.
<AllisZero> Oh god I hate my retarded bluetooth headset so much.
<MeteorVenture> saved
<Trollestia> ^
<NewDCD> 9I read that
<NewDCD> 9as "my retarded Blueblood headset"
<NewDCD> 9I then imagined Blueblood working in Telecommunications
<AllisZero> lol
<MeteorVenture> "my retarded Blueblood headset" made me think of assassins creed for some reason
<Trollestia> As realistic as Ace Combat usually is, I don't see how the plane opening up to reveal the laser is aerodynamically possible.
<NewDCD> 9Ace Combat works on Gundam physics
<NewDCD> 9try not to think about it so hard
<Trollestia> Which Gundam physics? They vary.
*TheDukeofFail beamspams Trollestia
<AllisZero> Sound in space
<MeteorVenture> the gurren lagann gundam physics
<AllisZero> That kind
<Trollestia> So, realistic until the plot says otherwise?
<MeteorVenture> no.. always realistic all the time
<Luna> 07,1how is everypony?
<TheDukeofFail> I am wearing shoes
<TheDukeofFail> feels good man
<Luna> 07,1i'm wearing socks ^^
<MeteorVenture> well.. actually.. yes
*AllisZero melts
<MeteorVenture> i am now wearing a heater
<Trollestia> Gurren Lagann has mecks using handguns, fuck that.
<Trollestia> *mechs
<MeteorVenture> OH ya i remember that.. that was an obscure observation
<AllisZero> What makes a $10000 computer be slow as shit with no signs of distress anywhere?
<TheDukeofFail> hate
<MeteorVenture> jk but i really didn't quite notice
<Trollestia> You forgot a background process somewhere.
<AllisZero> Weren't they using handguns because lowly Ganmen couldn't use spiral power?
<Trollestia> They could still have proper frame-mounted guns.
<MeteorVenture> what makes a $10000 computer?
<AllisZero> Ah, so THAT's the problem
<NewDCD> 9>Luna wearing socks
<NewDCD> 9IT BEGINS
<AllisZero> 2 $1500 processors, one $3000 video card and 12 gigs of expensive ram plus chassis, warranty and the license to name it "Darth Sidious"
<MeteorVenture> lol
<NewDCD> 9that reminds me
<Luna> 07,1not only socks
*Trollestia learned all my mech science from Armoured Core, I apologize.
*Luna giggles
<NewDCD> 9my computer's case is black with red accents
<NewDCD> 9so my system name? It's MAZINKAISER.
<NewDCD> 9also Luna not remotely what I meant
<Trollestia> My computer's case is black and cheap-looking.
<Luna> 07,1Oh dear what do you mean DCD?
*Luna does not have a computer
<TheDukeofFail> you IRC via magic?
<MeteorVenture> mine is purple and black
<Luna> 07,1nah a gaming notebook :)
<MeteorVenture> with green lights
<Trollestia> >implying that's not a computer
<MeteorVenture> a gaming notebook.. the game who's played in this notebook shall die

<TheDukeofFail> what does that mean? :x
<Luna> 07,1You will see :)
<TheDukeofFail> wee

<MeteorVenture> sea ponies were shoopin' before photoshop

<MeteorVenture> http://8.media.dorkly.cvcdn.com/c/1/97056a6c956c71ebd8d53491de2d39a0.jpg
<MeteorVenture> this makes sense
<Trollestia> Still, that poor kid.
<Trollestia> Ohai.
<MeteorVenture> lol ya.. i guess they were playing 007
<AllisZero> Flutterstream?
<AllisZero> Yay
<Trollestia> Goldeneye was probably my favourite N64 game, but i didn't exactly *game* then.
<MeteorVenture> me and my siblings played that alot
<Trollestia> Yeah.
<TheDukeofFail> goldeneye was so awesome
<MeteorVenture> with auto-aim off and licensed to kill (1 shot kills)
*Trollestia loves how I'm probably older than you, but we both nostalgia over Goldeneye.
<TheDukeofFail> oo, how old are you Trollestia?
<MeteorVenture> but not always.. sometimes just normal
<MeteorVenture> lol ya i'm 19:P
<Trollestia> Twenty-two now. Don't remind me.
<TheDukeofFail> lol
<TheDukeofFail> I'll be 22 in november D:
<Luna> 07,1age is just a number...
<TheDukeofFail> that's all very well saying that when you're immortal :colbert:
<Trollestia> Also, that means I've been here for three years. Odd.
<Diftraku> g'morning
<Trollestia> Morning.
<MeteorVenture> if age is just a number then why does everyone say i'm mature now that i'm 19? checkmate
<Trollestia> I'm probably fairly immature.
<AllisZero> Eh, I'm 25. You are all youngsters to me.
<MeteorVenture> i've always been mature for my age from what i can tell.. but being mature doesn't always mean acting like it:P
<AllisZero> 25 of age, 75 in will to live
<MeteorVenture> i thought you were zero
*Trollestia feels old, for various reasons.
<Rainbow-Dash> Ahh yes. Disco Discord?
<MeteorVenture> i remember feeling old even when i was only like.. 14 or 16 or something.. sometimes i would just think about how i wasted my life away.. then i would realize i'm still a kid
<AllisZero> I remember having those thoughts when I was 10, Meteor
<Luna> 07,1and yes it's Discord
<MeteorVenture> lol well i don't actually have a set timestamp on those thoughts.. lol
<MeteorVenture> but 10 is pretty young for those types of thoughts probably
<MeteorVenture> i don't seem to really have those thoughts anymore though
<MeteorVenture> at least i haven't for a long time
<Luna> 07,1streams up though :)
<Diftraku> Ooo
<Diftraku> Streaaam
<NewDCD> 9I was about going live cause I thought the stream was having aproblem O:
*Luna laughs
<NewDCD> 9was gonna play Bootfighter
<Luna> 07,1will put it down for ya ;)
<AllisZero> I want to see the stream but caaaaan't
<NewDCD> 9well I'll just stream a few minutes
<NewDCD> 9since I gotta study and all
<AllisZero> @meteor: I have them nowadays more than ever
<AllisZero> Even if by all standards my life has been pretty productive so far, I guess it goes without saying I'm one of those people who're never satisfied.
<MeteorVenture> never too late to start doing something.. and if you're doing what you should do those thoughts shouldn't be happening.. if they are they're not logical
<Luna> 07,1all yours dcd
<Trollestia> "This broadcast is offline. Please check back later."
<Luna> 07,1Trollestia
<Trollestia> Luna
<Luna> 07,1which site are you at?
<Rainbow-Dash> http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/dash/
<Trollestia> The wrong one.
<Luna> 07,1yea :P
<Rainbow-Dash> Dash is best theatre btw. :P
<Trollestia> ik
<Luna> 07,1Fluttershy is !
<Rainbow-Dash> Jk.. Wouldnt want to start anything unfortunate..
<Rainbow-Dash> XD
<Diftraku> Rainbow-Dash: Damn right it is!
<MeteorVenture> ok *goes in less crowded theatre for any seat in the house*
<Rainbow-Dash> Whats the difference between the theatres anyway?
<Diftraku> I guess it's just the stream
<Trollestia> Just the channel, I think.
<Luna> 07,1there's none just different chatrooms
<Diftraku> Or that
<Trollestia> Perpetual loading.
<AllisZero> My proxy doesn't like that streaming service apparently
<Diftraku> bu... bu... but dash loads faster...
<Luna> 07,1Lies!
<Dashite> Dash theatre is 20% faster
<Rainbow-Dash> Dash is also the first, and therefore the easiest to click on
<AllisZero> But yeah, this stream hardly ever worked for me, proxy or not
<Luna> 07,1Oh dear.. my bf is watching Mulan
<Rainbow-Dash> Overall it offers greater speed
<Diftraku> Luna: nothing wrong with that
<Rainbow-Dash> And a jumbo sized cup holder in every seat
<Rainbow-Dash> *cough*
<Diftraku> I watched Treasure Island last night
<Diftraku> *Planet even

<Diftraku> And are those operating systems beating tehmselves there?
<Trollestia> "This download has been disabled, possibly a newer version was released. Please visit the project website to get the latest download link(s). "
<Trollestia> :(
<Diftraku> Wot?
<NewDCD> 9the codecspam is because that's this game's communication system is like that
<NewDCD> 9you press a button and it sends a message
<Trollestia> I tried to download the game and got that.
<NewDCD> 9so the simulated players start spamming the communication
<Diftraku> Eww...

<Rainbow-Dash> On one of the FO3 loading screens
<Rainbow-Dash> With a robot horse
<Rainbow-Dash> Derp?
<Diftraku> That's a great slide :P
<Kitten> ok so who has this new Google+ thing?
<NewDCD> 9hmm
<NewDCD> 9I'm debating whether I should open a tumblr
<Dumori> He
<NewDCD> 9well I actually just got an idea
<Dumori> hey
<NewDCD> 9guys
<NewDCD> 9what would you think of "Ask BronyState"
<Trollestia> Why not?
<Dumori> Why so?
<Dumori> seems semi pointless
<AllisZero> Not underground enough for me
<NewDCD> 9I want to make a tumblr for drawings, but yeah
*NewDCD 9is actually a drawfag as well
<Dumori> for Brony State not sure why it's needed.
*NewDCD 9an art-blocked, very uninspired one, but one nonetheless
<NewDCD> 9well, for fun
*Dumori is a wirtefag my drawings are best left alone
<Dumori> true
<NewDCD> 9and "Ask New DCD" sounds a bit too much of own ego strokan
<Dumori> also DCD you stole my thunder I had a rant to make ;)
<Dumori> Stupid Fanstys Flight
<Dumori> The new 40kRPG book is in every shop in the UK
<Dumori> but they can;t sell it to friday
<Dumori> and I just spent too much on my trip out to buy the book I won't pick it up for ages.
<Dumori> and yeah Ask DCD is a bit egocentric
<NewDCD> 9maybe I should make Ask Caramel...
<NewDCD> 9(and then Val nuked me from orbit)
<Dumori> x3
<Dumori> So newDCD how are you?
<Dashite> Do it DCD!
<NewDCD> 9OH SHIT BROS
<NewDCD> 9I HAD THE GREATEST IDEA FOR A DRAWING
<NewDCD> 9will probably make it next week though since I'm really fucked up time-wise
<NewDCD> 9http://veranimesonline.com/anime_imgs/mazinkaiser-skl.jpg
<NewDCD> 9That
<NewDCD> 9with Snips and Snails
<Dumori> and I shall read the Leaverage RPG book
<Dumori> x3
<Dumori> i did not buy it just cos of the name honest
<Dumori> I did how ever down load the .pdf due to it
<AllisZero> Wow I hate these people so much.
<AllisZero> "Oh what's that? The PC broke down? Should've gotten a Mac"
<AllisZero> Yeah, please, be my guest and try to explain to the owner why spending 8 thousand dollars on a PC I bought for three makes more sense.
<Dumori> x3
<Dumori> hell a mac night not even do the same jobs
<Dumori> decently
<Diftraku> Trash can?
<Diftraku> Pony, please... it's been lost forevere
*Diftraku is thinking of that parody mac ad
<Dumori> oh I got stalked by a pony today
<Dumori> x3
<Diftraku> lol
<Dumori> was in zee city going to the FLGS
<Dumori> and there was a pony
<Dumori> on the street
<Dumori> for some charity
<Dumori> and i started following me
<Dumori> was weird
<Dumori> wasn't candy coloued though
<Dumori> :(
<Dumori> is it saturday yet?
<Rainbow-Dash> It is in my thoughts.
<Dumori> lol
<Dumori> well I need it to be firday
<Dumori> gotta blow my money on pointless stuff
<Dumori> my music libary some time disurbes even me
<Diftraku> Dumori: how come?
<Dumori> Mindless Self Indulgence/ The Left Rights tracks
<Dumori> normaly only iffy if they are on right after something much more normal or a zone out for a bit
<Dumori> but zoneing back in to a song about anal toeing is quite jarring to say the least
<Trollestia> Hmm. Is the cutie mark of the Anonpony the words "cutie mark not available?"
<Dumori> maybe
<AllisZero> Wow, this is making me increasingly mad.
<Dashite> Trollestia, it's actuall a little red X
<Trollestia> Fair enough.
<Trollestia> So the face is covered with text like Anon's, right?

<DSD> 2Nice
<Diftraku|Vectoring> still waiting for the helpdesk to open fw ports...
<Diftraku|Vectoring> So I can use irssi as a proxy :3
<Suinide> It was a pain :p but im an achievement whore and wanted to be done and go to gears 3. Seriously 2.0 :P it sucked
<DSD> 2Same i like Achievements
<Dashite> Lonesome Road is out today. :)
<Dashite> Or yesterday, but whatever.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Good lord, those images.... no matter how much I scrub, my brain will never be clean again...
<MeteorVenture> you gotta be VERY good to draw that bad
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I mean most of the pose sketches are actually GOOD, I seriously don't understand how he can fuck up the last step so much.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15...and the faces, sweet mother of Celestia...
<AllisZero> Problem is
<Suinide> Whats your gamerscore?
<Diftraku|Vectoring> RobotPinkie: the eyes...
<MeteorVenture> i will treasure those faces.. and show them to my sister who will instantly lose her drawing abilities
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ahaha, oh lawd
<Diftraku|Vectoring> lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Undoing years of training in one fell swoop
<DSD> 2i think like 8,000
<MeteorVenture> lol
<MeteorVenture> wait.. http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/src/131662377926.jpg
<Suinide> Pfft, mines 32,000 something
<MeteorVenture> the bottom right image instantly made me think of "feels good man"
<AllisZero> I'm bad but not that bad
<Diftraku|Vectoring> lol
<AllisZero> Those people HAVE to be trolling
<AllisZero> There's no way anyone can be that much of a crook
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Top image is the colored version of that.... Quick, to the macro-mobile!
<Diftraku|Vectoring> lol
<DSD> 2wow
<DSD> 2Hey GGgala_
<Suinide> Its wierd when i look at my games, like it shouldnt be that high
<Suinide> If i had all that i could id have like 60000
<MeteorVenture> if that tutorial taught me anything it's "don't be afraid to make mistakes"
<AllisZero> Riiiight
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha... I dunno, in some cases I think the mediocre drawing in books like that is a good thing, like "don't worry if it's not perfect"
<AllisZero> The person who wrote the damn book is a mistake
<RobotPinkie> 06,15In this case, it's WAY beyond that.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1WAI DO I HAVE 'AT THE GALA' STUCK IN MAH HEAD?! D:
<Diftraku|Vectoring> Fluttershy`: I know the thing to get it out there
<TheDukeofFail> that's the pony song that gets stuck in my head the most too :c
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I am here at the grand gala, for it is the best party
<TheDukeofFail> but THEN
<TheDukeofFail> WINTER WRAP UP
<TheDukeofFail> and repeat
<RobotPinkie> 06,15but the one thing it was missing was a pony named Pinkie!
*Fluttershy` pokes RobotPinkie hard in the spleen
<RobotPinkie> 06,15owwww, my spleen :(
<Diftraku|Vectoring> Fluttershy`: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeOYJO-jFGs
<MeteorVenture> i was thinking "a pony named ariel" then..... WE NEED A PONIFIED VERSION
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Diftraku|Vectoring erm... thank you for making my brain explode -twitch-
<Suinide> You should give me your gamertag, so if you get gears 3 i can kill you ruthlessly
<Diftraku|Vectoring> :3
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, I've seen that one :P
<Diftraku|Vectoring> I wish I could try that just for lultz
*Fluttershy` falls on the ground and dies
<Diftraku|Vectoring> I'd need a place in the middle of nowhere for it though xD
<MeteorVenture> i'm starting to feel kinda bad about laughing about all this
<MeteorVenture> not that video.. i mean the drawings
<Diftraku|Vectoring> I think I just found my favourite 1 second video on youtube
<Diftraku|Vectoring> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDCDyQBFsF8

<MeteorVenture> there's a dude named Dhaos on a game i played.. can't come up with a joke so there's the reference
<Diftraku|Vectoring> Also, no Chaos - Control jokes? Sun, I am dissappoint...

<Trollestia> I've run recursive VMs, does that count?
<WhatPayne> Can't wait for new Pinkie songs.
<Diftraku> Trollestia: yes, it counts
<WhatPayne> Too bad there's a gap between ep 2 and 3
<Trollestia> Got to ten without lag.
<Diftraku> I probably should get my Vista and XP install disks
<Diftraku> And go all the way back to 95
<Diftraku> Recursively
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh wow, that's like... the best join message ever...

*Luna wonders why that clop image was still open
<ValtheJean> 2,14 our ancestors have always been sea ponies! My father was! And his father before him. And his father before him. And his father before him....
<Organic_Algorithm> Actually, wouldn't thungerhooves be a lobster or something?
<MeteorVenture> draw the butcher from diablo 1 as a sea pony.. or just a pony at all
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well yeah, but there's no such thing as a sea buffalo....
<Diftraku> ValtheJean: <3
<Organic_Algorithm> Or a crab?
<Dermathil> >mfw I notice a Julius Caesar ref
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh I know it, Fluttershy` <3
<Dermathil> ooh, the one who made it deserves a cookie.
<MeteorVenture> draw that dude in the ad as a sea pony
*VioletVanilla is wondering along with luna
<Trollestia> Nah, he meant the Fallout Caesar. :p
<Diftraku> Dermathil: :P
<Dermathil> eh
<Dermathil> Etu Bruti?
<Dermathil> Am I the only one who read Shakespeare's Julius Caesar?
<Organic_Algorithm> Confound you artists and your abilities to take simple shapes and make them into awesome sauce!
<Diftraku> Et tu Brute is actually a name of a map in Halo 3 campaign
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I did dermathil, hence the "Down with Caeser" line :P
<Dermathil> Dirfraku: that's a reference to the line in the shakespeare play
*Dermathil brohoofs Valthejean.
*ValtheJean brohoofs dermathil
<Diftraku> Referenceception!
<Luna> 07,1lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You so awesome, Fluttershy` <3
<RobotPinkie> 06,15PLZ SAVE IT FOR ME
<WhatPayne> Say Fluttershy`, is it easier to draw with draw tablet than with regular pencil?
<Organic_Algorithm> I still think he should be a shell fish of some kind
<Dermathil> You sir, got great literary tastes. And that's one of those things that are awesome.
*Dermathil has read hamlet, Julius caesar and Romeo&Juliet
<ValtheJean> 2,14 :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, in my brit lit class we had the choice between JC and Romeo and Juliet
<Dermathil> noo, fluttershy.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and I read Romeo and Juliet WAY too many times (hate that play)
<Diftraku> Nooo, the Caesar references :P
<trebthegamer> he looks like a snake
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so I went with JC
<MeteorVenture> we need chief thunderhooves with an afro
<Dermathil> The refception was about the Julius Caesar ref
<prince-dari> No Macbeth?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not for that particular assignment
<Dermathil> have yet to read it, dari
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Macbeth was the year before
<trebthegamer> probably
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha
<Dermathil> Fluttershy, the ref was unrelated to you
<ValtheJean> 2,14 YOU HAVEN'T READ MACBETH?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15YAY!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Bubble bubble toil and trouble?
<Dermathil> Valthejean, haven't read it YET
<Dermathil> It is in my to-read
*ValtheJean takes back his brohoof

<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol I was waiting to see if you'd catch that dari
<RobotPinkie> 06,15^
<RobotPinkie> 06,15What Luna said
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's a joke from my brit lit class :P
<Luna> 07,1singing*
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Dermathil> >yfw my lit teacher spoke about BLADE RUNNER in class
<Dermathil> today
<Trollestia> A wild virtual machine appears!

<ValtheJean> 2,14 Sea pegasi don't have wings! they have FINS!

<mib_zcmm2p> Oh, I'm just some sock puppet account for someone who was too afraid to ask with my username for some reason that I don't remember now RobotPinkie
<ValtheJean> 2,14 just like everyone knows if you play the Skyward Sword trailer backwards it's zelda's lullaby
<MeteorVenture> then suddenly my face fell off
<RandomExtra> You're a mod now RP? Congratulations!

<Luna> 07,1No he's not
<RandomExtra> Oh.

<Diftraku> Dat hostname
<Dermathil> Valthejean, I already read Julius Caesar
<ValtheJean> 2,14 GET READING AGAIN
<RandomExtra> Ah. Well, congrats to all then.
<prince-dari> It's because of the network merges.
*Fluttershy` pokes prince-dari

<AndroUser2> Aw it didn't change my nick..
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm so banned by now...
<Dermathil> ooh, someone's connected on his android phone
<prince-dari> Fluttershy`: 10,11/)13^10,11313^10,11(\
<Diftraku> Dermathil: I've been on my android few times here :P
<Trollestia> It's algorithm.
<Organic_Algorithm> Am I Evil, by Diamond Head, /Docta/
<Diftraku> Got to love irssi for that reason
<Fluttershy`> 08,11bliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinding
<Dermathil> Diftraku: I didn't notice it due to whoising you
<Dermathil> YAY
<Flutterguy> Using AndroIRC at the moment.
<Dermathil> Someone fixed it with the ham banner again!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 mmmmm.....ham banner....
<Diftraku> Dermathil: It doesn't show up on /who, I got irssi running 247
<RobotPinkie> 06,15permenant ham banner? Sounds delicious.
*Dermathil brohoofs Prince-dari for bringing it back
<Trollestia> Delicious ham banner.
<Diftraku> ham banner... *drools*
*prince-dari brohoofs Dermathil
<Trollestia> Your IRC is lagging.
<Flutterguy> Satisfying ham banner
<Organic_Algorithm> Banhammers are for chumps. Real men wear a good pair of boots
<RandomExtra> Ham banner? AH! Don't post any spoilers gaiz! You'll ban all of the ham from BronyState, and we don't want that to happen do we?
<Flutterguy> Oh the lag..
<Trollestia> Such lag.
<Diftraku> Dem streamception!
<Flutterguy> Indeed
<Organic_Algorithm> Dat lag....
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Or maybe we'll turn all of the bans into ham?
<Diftraku> We must go deeper...
*ValtheJean bans Ham
<Flutterguy> Lagception?
<Flutterguy> o.o
<Organic_Algorithm> Indeed
<Fluttershy`> 08,1darnit >>
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I hate lag D:
<Diftraku> RobotPinkie: would that be set mode +h then?
<Flutterguy> Lol Fluttershy
<RobotPinkie> 06,15+ham, pretty sure...
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I don't even know how badly it's lagging! >_<
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Then only mods can talk.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1okay
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I will say something
<Fluttershy`> 08,1now
<MeteorVenture> singer fluttershy's lament
<RobotPinkie> 06,15...about ham.
<MeteorVenture> sing*
<Diftraku> There's about a second or two between irc and video Fluttershy`
<Trollestia> Yeas, sing Fluttershy's Lament...somehow.
<Trollestia> *Yeah
<RobotPinkie> 06,15More than that...
<Diftraku> ^
<Diftraku> Oh poo... Steam lost connection again...
<RobotPinkie> 06,156 seconds or so for me, but it's okay.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1hmmm
<Fluttershy`> 08,1guess it depends on connection speed
<MeteorVenture> global warming is not an issue! we got air conditioners
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I mean it's lag on two places, first your stream has to reach Luna, then Luna has to reach us.
<Trollestia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSLvjfrxynA Good luck.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1ahh true
<Diftraku> Actually
<RobotPinkie> 06,15or well "lag", Luna probably gets it as fast as possible :P
<Trollestia> It's a good song, just impossible to sing.
<Diftraku> First Fluttershy` streams to livestream, which is then passed to Luna and who then streams it to owncast and then to us :3
<Organic_Algorithm> Oh hey. I was looking for that song
<DSD> 2Hey Spyrorocks
<Trollestia> You're welcome, then.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1though Luna has super fast internet lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, I thought that part was kinda understood in the process.
<Organic_Algorithm> Streamception
<Diftraku> :P
<Flutterguy> Oh so there is aa stream?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah Flutterguy, bronystate.net
<Organic_Algorithm> This is almost as cool as NewDCD's streamception
*Organic_Algorithm wishes he could stream. One day...
<Flutterguy> RobotPinkie can't get on my computer for a couple of hours, I'm just on mobile talking.. :/
*Trollestia has nothing of interest to stream.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Aw, too bad Flutterguy :(
<Flutterguy> Yeah..

<MeteorVenture> we want bip bop music!
<Fluttershy`> 08,1http://blade-zulah.deviantart.com/art/Seeds-of-a-Dream-257637003
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I kinda want to do some streaming of when I play games...
<WhatPayne> ah
<Diftraku> Oh lawl
<Diftraku> That comic xD
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Only problem is my computer kinda blows.
<Organic_Algorithm> RobotPinkie you and me both
<Flutterguy> Someday RobotPinkie :)
<Trollestia> I don't always play games on my computer. But when I do, it's usually TF2.
<WhatPayne> That's quite, um, interesting comic.
<Diftraku> http://blade-zulah.deviantart.com/art/Season-2-Blues-254329589
<Diftraku> Love that one as well
<Dermathil> ­>mfw I discover there's a livestream stuff available called megalive
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, someday I'm gonna stream when I play Ninja Gaiden Sigma on Way of the Master Ninja difficulty :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That should be hilarious.
<Flutterguy> Sad day for Fluttershy.
<Trollestia> Me sitting behind my sentry would be boring. PS3 games, less boring, but harder to stream.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Probably never gonna happen, though, lawl
<Diftraku> Ewwww, sims
<Trollestia> Sims 3 is good.
<Flutterguy> Bleh sims
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Minecraft is fun to watch, if the right person is playing.
<Diftraku> Sims is only good for locking your sim in a block surrounded with mirrors
<Diftraku> And then speeding up time
<MeteorVenture> terraria is behtur
<Dermathil> MEINC--
<Organic_Algorithm> Diftraku ...What?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yay Jolicraft!!!!!

<Diftraku> Organic_Algorithm: I had Sims 2 a while ago for a short time
<Diftraku> Didn't really play it
<Flutterguy> Diftraku you know what was better? Playing Sim City games and constantly calling on natural disasters.
<Diftraku> Flutterguy: I did that so often :P

<Dermathil> BTW GUYS
<Flutteryay> Discord confirmed for Celestia-tier troll!
*Diftraku slaps Dermathil with a trout
<Flutteryay> *Trollestia-tier
<Dermathil> Minecraft 1.9 pre-release is out!
*Dermathil punches Diftraku.
<Diftraku> Leaked or for real?
<EspyLacopa> Flutteryay: I thought that was a given.
<Flutteryay> true but this clip...
<Flutteryay> Nevermind
<EspyLacopa> Celestia vs Discord trolling fight?
<Dermathil> Diftraku: comes from the Hub youtube. Do with that what you will.
<Diftraku> I mean the Minecraft pre-release...
<FlutterBro13> I've already modded my 1.8....
<Diftraku> :3
<Dermathil> Diftraku: the 1.9 pre-release is the same thing as the 1.8 pre-release as in bug-fixing time
<FlutterBro13> I know. I wanna try it out but I don't wanna lose my mods again
<Dermathil> FlutterBro13: lavaslimes
<FlutterBro13> and some of them aren't even 1.8.1 yet...
<Dermathil> also, fireball throwers
<FlutterBro13> ...
<Dermathil> :3
<FlutterBro13> I will make another backup
<Diftraku> Wait... it's alreayd 1.8.1?
<Turgle> isn't 1.9?
<Dermathil> Diftraku: yes.
<Diftraku> ...
<Dermathil> But pre-release 1.9 has been leaked by Jeb.
<Diftraku> Minecraft really needs a better modding system
<Dermathil> Diftraku, they are working on it.
<Dermathil> But they got bigger things to take care of first.
<Diftraku> Yeah
<Dermathil> Like, release the game?
<EspyLacopa> Isn't Minecraft still in Beta?

<prince-dari> "
<prince-dari> Damn
<prince-dari> Bill Gates is the nicest guy ever.
*prince-dari hugs everyone
<FreezeFrame> He really is a nice guy, too
<FreezeFrame> He gives away about 80% of his income
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That's kind of old news, isn't it? I thought he pledged that years ago. :O
*Flaria hugs RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> 06,15 and yeah, he pretty much is.
*RobotPinkie hugs Flaria
<Flaria> I missed you in the epic group hug :C
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I missed an epic group hug? :O
*Nittany_Tiger hugs channel.
<prince-dari> Yeah, the date on it is 2008
<prince-dari> I just hadn't seen it till now.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh okay, cool. Yeah I love Bill Gates, he gets too much hate.
<Flaria> RobotPinkie: I hugged everyone I know on #bronystate
<Flaria> You must've been offline :c
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Probably, or I may have been idling...
<LordCelestia> Guys, i figured out a cool new way to make awesome pictures better than my orevious method
<Flutterguy> ?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15but then I'd still be on the list
<Flaria> ^
<LordCelestia> i can make art for any of yall if u want
<Flaria> I scrolled through the list.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Lens flares, LordCelestia?
<Flaria> It was three lines long on Mibbit. :3
<Nittany_Tiger> If only all CEOs weren't consumer-hating assholes.
<LordCelestia> no, actually, i just mastered Powerpoint in school and i fugred out that I can use its transparency options and such as an awesome picture editor
<prince-dari> *Cough*Sony*Cough*
<Flutterguy> I'll be back.
<Nittany_Tiger> *Cough*ActivisionEAUbisoft*Cough*
<prince-dari> ACTIVISION
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I dunno what's so bad about Sony when compared to Nintendo or something.
<prince-dari> EVIL DOER!
<prince-dari> >Nintendo
<prince-dari> >bad
<prince-dari> Wut
<LordCelestia> *Cough*Treyarch*Cough**Hack**Choke**Pas-out*
<Sumica> Any one with more cash then me is evil cause they have mroe cash then me.
<prince-dari> >Sony
<prince-dari> >not bad
<Flaria> ^This.
<LordCelestia> ^is true
<Flaria> Err.
<Flaria> What Sumica said.
<LordCelestia> lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Removing the Player's Choice titles? Keeping the price on the Wii artificially high?
<Nittany_Tiger> It's not about being rich. It's about being an outright asshole or abusing customer rights.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Kazuo Hirai being arrogant doesn't make all of Sony bad...
<ajponiisbestponi> whats up
<prince-dari> >gives their customers rootkits
<prince-dari> They gave their customers rootkits for God's sake.
<prince-dari> Not much gets worse than that.
<Nittany_Tiger> >Strips PS3 of a feature and gives no good reason why. Ignores blog and posts complaining about it.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Sony Music Group of course being the ones who make the games and consoles...
<prince-dari> Yeah, an advertised feature.
<prince-dari> Some people bought the console for it.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, removing Other OS was shitty
<prince-dari> What they did was illegal. <_<
<Nittany_Tiger> I didn't update my PS3. Didn't play it for 9 months. Then it was stolen :M
<Nittany_Tiger> :<
<prince-dari> :O
<RobotPinkie> 06,15People will have found another company to hate in a couple of years, no doubt.
<Nittany_Tiger> If the company gives them a reason.
<Nittany_Tiger> Just people gamers weren't 90% sheeple.
<prince-dari> MFW after the first Sony rootkit scandal they dumb bastards actually put a rootkit on another of their products 2 years later
<Nittany_Tiger> *wish
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Meh, Nintendo can do whatever the fuck they want without getting the same kind of hate.
<EspyLacopa> What's this I hear about Windows 8 having special hardware that prevents other OSes from being installed on the machine?
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> >Bill Gates no longer in charge
<FreezeFrame> EspyLacopa: Windows 8 has zero hardware
<EspyLacopa> Isn't that what Apple used to do?
<prince-dari> >PCs become OS locked
<EspyLacopa> So, Apple machines will be unlocked for OSes, and PCs are OS locked.
<FreezeFrame> It may rely on hardware that serves a similar purpose, but there is no hardware in an OS
<EspyLacopa> *snerk*
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Microsoft under Bill Gates did some really shitty things, too.
<FreezeFrame> So did Apple in the early days
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I doubt it was his personal decision in those cases, though
<prince-dari> "Neutrino experiment sees them apparently moving faster than light"
<prince-dari> >faster than light
<prince-dari> >wut
<Nittany_Tiger> Tachyons!
<FreezeFrame> dari: It's a poorly done layman's version of it
<RobotPinkie> 06,15>nowai
<Nittany_Tiger> I heard about that.
<FreezeFrame> Basically, the central point of the velocity was > c, but its error range was greater than how much faster it was
<FreezeFrame> Therefore, it probably wasn't actually > c
<Nittany_Tiger> Error range > c?
<FreezeFrame> Let me find the thing again
<Nittany_Tiger> So it could be going nowhere :p
<Flaria> Here we go, that took forever
<Nittany_Tiger> I know what you mean.
<Nittany_Tiger> Large error.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Either it wasn't actually faster than the speed of light, or we'll have to rewrite the fundamentals of physics.
<Flaria> My stance on Sony VS. Nintendo: http://hejibits.com/comics/2011-08-01-apologies.png
<RobotPinkie> 06,15My bet is on the former.
<EspyLacopa> Wouldn't be the first time we had to do so, RobotPinkie.
<Nittany_Tiger> I heard String Theory predicts tachyons.
<Randall1160> HALLO THAR
<FreezeFrame> They were determined to be at a velocity of 1.000051 c, with an error range greater than .000051 c
<RobotPinkie> 06,15>implying hashed and salted passwords could in any way be useful to a hacker without knowing at least the salt
<FreezeFrame> Basically, nohting to get up in arms about yet.
<prince-dari> String theory is so ridiculous.
<EspyLacopa> Wait. You can play virtual console games on the 3DS?
<FreezeFrame> They have GB VC for now, and are adding NES and GBA
<prince-dari> Wow, that's pretty solid.
<Flutterguy> That's pretty sweet.
<EspyLacopa> Suddenly, Nintendo being so hard against emulators makes sense.
<Flaria> ^
<Randall1160> HOWZABOUT PLAYING WITH DOS Games lol
<Randall1160> THTAS a blast to a past
<Randall1160> THATS*
<EspyLacopa> Whoa man, that may be too awesome.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15So many good DOS games that can't be played on modern computers. :(
<Randall1160> DOS BOX
<EspyLacopa> That's what DosBox is for.
<Randall1160> hard to use but makes almost all of them work
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Um, no
<Flutterguy> Is it sad that my only memory of playing DOS was playing Wolfenstein 3D? :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15If I had said "all", then sure :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I do love DOSBox, though
<Randall1160> :P
<Flaria> This is why I still have XP :3
<Flutterguy> Gotta go eat dinner, bye all. Will be back in about an hour.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15but it's compatibility is still far from perfect, which is unfortunate
<EspyLacopa> My main memory of DOS games were those old Roberta Williams adventure games. King's Quest, Space Quest, Police Quest. . .
<EspyLacopa> So much questing.
<Randall1160> I think my favorite game for DOS is very Obscure one called Zeppelins:Giants of the SKy? or something like that
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ahhh, I love those games
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Though I'm pretty sure the first two series got XP conversions
<EspyLacopa> I don't know. Going back now to play those. . .they're just highly frustrating.
<Randall1160> lol
<Randall1160> so true
<EspyLacopa> That damn gnome in the first King's Quest, and trying to guess his name.
<EspyLacopa> Or that stupid snake-girdle-horse puzzle in King's Quest 2.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Aw, I still love going through my LucasArts adventure games every now and then.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I wait just long enough to forget most of the puzzles :P
<EspyLacopa> Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle. . .
<EspyLacopa> Sam and Max.
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> LulzSec member got caught.
<Flaria> Dat Maniac Mansion
<RobotPinkie> 06,15The Dig, Full Throttle
<Flaria> ^whut
<Flaria> Can has info, Dari?
<EspyLacopa> Zak McKraken and the Alien Mindbenders.
<prince-dari> I liked LulzSec, because they were funny, but I still find it funny that one of them got caught.
<prince-dari> "To hide his identity when performing the attack, the FBI claims that Kretsinger used VPN service HideMyAss.com. In spite of this, activity was traced to an address in Arizona."
<prince-dari> LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
<prince-dari> DAHAHASHSHDFAHSHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<Randall1160> O________________O
<Randall1160> I remember a game called KGB, That was extremely difficult
<Randall1160> obviously about the KGB
<EspyLacopa> Given all the high profile stuff that lulzsec has been doing, I kinda figured that them being caught was a given eventually.
*Flaria falls over, laughing madly
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That is srsly 1337 of him....
<prince-dari> And that's why you make sure your VPN is based somewhere that doesn't give a shit.
<Nittany_Tiger> Sad that they never hacked Activision.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, oh that I would have liked
<Nittany_Tiger> Distribute Kotick's mailing address and stuff.
<Zephirdd> Hacking ActiBlizzard and trolling the sc2 servers writting 'LAN NOW' would be hilarious imo
<Randall1160> looool
<prince-dari> "Earlier this month, police in the UK arrested two men claimed to be LulzSec member "Kayla". LulzSec spokesman Topiary was arrested in July, and the previous month, Ryan Cleary, who operated a LulzSec IRC server, was arrested. The ringleader of the group, Sabu, has tweeted that there are now only two LulzSec members at large."
<prince-dari> Ahahahahahaha
<prince-dari> Fail.
<Flaria> Hah
<Flaria> I have a friend named Ryan Cleary, except he's far from good at computers
<Nittany_Tiger> I miss gaming before I learned what Kotick said at that certain speech.
<Randall1160> lol
<Flaria> Nittany_Tiger: What speech?
<Zephirdd> silly nittany
<prince-dari> I'm almost disappoint that no more lulzsec hacks, but to be honest that they got caught is funnier than the hacks they were doing.
<Zephirdd> I mean
<Zephirdd> silly Flaria
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Wouldn't call it unexpected.
<Zephirdd> he is obviously much better than you think
<Zephirdd> he is just hiding himself
<Flaria> He's trollin' a lotta people, then.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<RobotPinkie> 06,15What did he say, Nittany_Tiger?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Kotick has said a lot of stupid things...
<prince-dari> What the Ryan Cleary guy got arrested just for hosting the IRC?
<prince-dari> That sucks. XD
<Nittany_Tiger> http://open.salon.com/blog/mikewatts/2010/02/18/an_analysis_of_bobby_koticks_dice_speech
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pretty sure he wasn't arrested just for that, lol
<prince-dari> "Ryan Cleary, who operated a LulzSec IRC server"
<prince-dari> It doesn't say he did anything else. O_o
<RobotPinkie> 06,15There's not really all that information, I'd assume he worked with them in some capacity.
<Nittany_Tiger> Where is the exact thing at?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Hard to know from just an article.
<Nittany_Tiger> http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/9.151292-Activision-s-Bobby-Kotick-hates-developers-innovation-cheap-games-you Here. This is where it all started.
<Randall1160> BRB
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah I remember that...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Made me realize how much of a dick he is
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Good thing there's still competition and that not everyone is like that...
<Nittany_Tiger> The major players are.
<Trollestia> Flutteryay: You pinged me?
<Nittany_Tiger> Either buy Activision's extremely-monotinized CoD, EA's Orwellian games or ones with online passes, or Ubisoft games with online passes or draconian DRM.
<Nittany_Tiger> And then there's online passes, install limits, draconian DRM, and other crap abound.
<Nittany_Tiger> Gaming sucks now.
*Flaria sighs
<Flaria> Truth
<EspyLacopa> Or bypass the nonsense and get pirated versions.
<Sumica> man gameing sounds depressing.
<Nittany_Tiger> Eeyup.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol, I think games are getting better and better.
<Trollestia> *pirate.swf*
<Sumica> good thing we got ponies
<EspyLacopa> The games are, yes.
<EspyLacopa> The ridiculous anti-pirate measures however are getting worse.
<Nittany_Tiger> And the monotization.
<Nittany_Tiger> And this "Used games are taking our money!" BS.
<Flaria> ^
<EspyLacopa> I miss the days when part of the instruction manual was to make a backup copy of your game discs and use the backups instead of the original discs to play the game.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Only problem is with the Activision and EA, when you don't actually buy a whole game but some of it is activated DLC that you only get once
<RobotPinkie> 06,15but most of the games I buy for consoles are the same way they've been since the Master System days...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15PC gaming seems to get worse and worse, though...
<Nittany_Tiger> Console gaming will see DRM. It does sometimes.
