<SirSprinkles> 6On completely random words.
<Ghosties> 4Exactly
<NightSeas> 12Hello Shadow_Lugia
<Ghosties> 4I think April Fools would be the ideal day to just screw with everybody by using a ton of wordfilters
<SirSprinkles> 6TRUST THE MUSHROOMS
<SirSprinkles> 6I filters to "I'm from the barnyard"
<prince-dari> I'm going to wordfilter all the pony names other than Rainbow Dash to worst pony. :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8DO IT DARI
*prince-dari is ultimate troll.
<Hipster_Brony> 8DOOOOOOOOOOO ITTTTTTTT

<SirSprinkles> 6Random things filter to it, but it all filters to something else
<prince-dari> Derpy button is best button.
<Hipster_Brony> 8nope
<Hipster_Brony> 8this is best button: http://instantbutton.me/buttons/ds2_20110710044121.html
<SirSprinkles> 6"mod" filters to "supreme overlord"
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<SilverSonic> Hai

<SirSprinkles> 6YESH
<Flutterpeanut> 13Hay guise.
<SirSprinkles> 6O HAI PEANUT
<Flutterpeanut> 13If you wanna see me shit myself.
<Hipster_Brony> 8...
<Flutterpeanut> 13I'm gonna livestream Amnesia tomorrow.
<Flutterpeanut> 13Around 4-5 pm est
<Flutterpeanut> 13:3
<Hipster_Brony> 8ummm
<Hipster_Brony> 8we all have to be here for mod interviews tomorrow
<Flutterpeanut> 13Is it tomorrow. I thought it was today.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, wednesday
<Hipster_Brony> 8we're interviewing metal link at 4 and sathi at 5
<Flutterpeanut> 13M. THEN I SHALL RESCHEDUEL.
<Lati> 12LOOOOOOOOOOL
<Ghosties> 4Amnesia, eh
<Hipster_Brony> 8actually, lets take this over to the mod channel
<Ghosties> 4I thought about getting Penumbra: Black Plague which is made by the guys who did Amnesia
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Ovo
<Ghosties> Yeah, the last time we an interview it was just me and hipster
<Ghosties> And Hipster had to look for photos, so I gave the entire interview to RBD
<Ghosties> Well, I mean, Sprinks came in later and then Silver even later
<Hipster_Brony> but yeah, i want all of us to be here, or as many as possible
<Flutterpeanut> It wont be hard to change the time.
<Hipster_Brony> i mean, sathi is basically a shoo-in
<NightSeas> 12Hi SS
<Ghosties> Don't wanna count our Scootaloos before they hatch, however
<Hipster_Brony> yeah, but still
<SilverSonic> ;o
<Hipster_Brony> she would have to majorly fuck up in the interview to not get hired at this point
<prince-dari> I don't know anything about Sathi, someone want to explain to my why I'm hearing these rave reviews? XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I will actually be here this time. I sware.
<Flutterpeanut> I didn't know. But now that hipster as skype I'm easier to contact here.
<Ghosties> Truthfully, other than having experience on IRC and modding, what else was there to be so excited about?
<SirSprinkles> 6Peanut, what's your skype?
<Hipster_Brony> shes older, has mod experience, has been to every single BMN, and is in europe
<Flutterpeanut> tiga1124
<Ghosties> AND SHE'S A GRUL
<Hipster_Brony> that too
<Ghosties> *ahem
<Ghosties> *gurl
<Hipster_Brony> and honestly, thats a pretty significant benefit
<Ghosties> Granted, yeah, that's a really good starting point
<Hipster_Brony> because she has a different perspective on things
<Flutterpeanut> I care more about personality and how they'd handle situations. :3
<Ghosties> She has most of us partway into letting her in already
<Ghosties> But still
<NightSeas> 12!Pokemon
<ScriptBot> NightSeas, you are a 13Exeggcute.
<Ghosties> It's not the questions part that bothers me
<prince-dari> WIMINZ? On my internet?! :P
<Ghosties> I have no worries there
<NightSeas> 12.-.
<Ghosties> It's the pictures
<Lati> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Lati, you are a 11Woobat.
<Ghosties> All it would take is for her to bomb the pictures part
<Ghosties> and I wouldn't be too sure about her
<Ghosties> But if she's modded before, then I guess there shouldn't be too much concern
<Hipster_Brony> goddammit, im going to have to look at that cupcakes pic again
<Ghosties> You're such a diva, Hip :P
<Hipster_Brony> seriously, fuck that picture
<prince-dari> Meh, I like cupcakes Pinkie.
<Ghosties> And I don't mean to pick on you (well, I kinda do), but, it's just blood and gore
<Ghosties> and ponies
<Ghosties> no big deal
<Hipster_Brony> i would rather keep blood and gore away from my ponies
<Ghosties> Tell that to the internet >>
<SirSprinkles> 6YOU GOT BLOOD AND GORE IN MY PONIES
<Hipster_Brony> grimdark and CMC shipping are really the only things that get me riled up in the fandom
<SirSprinkles> 6YOU GOT /OAT/ IN MY /CHAT/
<Ghosties> YOU GOT PONIES IN MY BLOOD AND GORE
<prince-dari> I maintain that cupcakes is meant to be funny.
<Ghosties> People CMC ship? Really?
<Angel_Espeon> 13!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Angel_Espeon, you are a 11Doduo.
<Ghosties> I'm not surprised by that, I'm surprised that I didn't even think about that
<prince-dari> You said yourself Ghosties, it's the internet.
<prince-dari> People ship EVERYTHING.
<Ghosties> No, yeah, it's understandable
<Ghosties> I'm just surprised at myself for not thinking about that
<Ghosties> Of course it's gonna happen
<prince-dari> I wouldn't be surprised if there was rock and tree porn on the internet.
<Ghosties> I'm sure there is
<Armads> oh hey, forum's back.

<Shadow_Lugia> 6Why do I see Tom Lehrer and Richard Feynman as the same person?
<Ghosties> It honestly can't be worse than a Mountain Dew can fucking a stick
<prince-dari> MFW I realise that they've been showing 1 MLP episode a day here and I thought it was 1 a week, so I've missed 7 episodes. >___>
<Manlyguy> Hey, Angel. Or AE. Or Espeon. Don't know which short version to take. xD
<Hipster_Brony> >mfw they're all on youtube http://www.ciscolife.ca/trollface.png
<prince-dari> MFW I wanted to support MLP in the UK by giving it higher viewing figures, so they'd see it's successful. :'(
<Angel_Espeon> 13Angel is the one I like best :P
<prince-dari> Then maybe we'd get some merchandise.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I like Espy too, but that tends to get me confused with Xeli or the Espy who used to be here before |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13and hai Sparky~
<Sparky> 'ey Angel!
<Hipster_Brony> im still holding out hope that they will eventually make a dash plushie that looks like dash from the show
<Espeon> 06Espy is Angel_Espeon, Espeon is me.
<Espeon> 06That simple |D
<Manlyguy> Must have taken a while to get used to that. lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13Some people call you Espy though
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I never know whether they're talking to me or you D:

<Hipster_Brony> the entire internet

<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't ever plan on moving out of the UK, so xD
<prince-dari> Pretty big step up there Hipster. XD
<Bakphoon> i'd like to move to canada
<Ghosties> "We" as in BMN or FiM?

<Flutterpeanut> Verizon Fios is good internets tho
<Flutterpeanut> :(
<SirSprinkles> 6I have found my new favorite pony song parody.
<Ghosties> If it's not Equestria Girls feat. Nigel Thornberry...
<Ghosties> I'll be sorely disappointed
<SirSprinkles> 6Fluttershys.
<SilverSonic> AE, you must go to America someday :B
<SirSprinkles> 6Parody of Fireflies.
<Bakphoon> it's not that it's bad to live here, it's just not good :V
<Ghosties> I am sorely disappointed
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've been to Florida before
<SirSprinkles> 6But that is a very close second. :D
<Bakphoon> Florida's okay
<prince-dari> Ghosties: I still prefer the original Equestria Girls to the Nigel Thornberry one. :P
<Bakphoon> too hot
<Angel_Espeon> 13and my mum seems to want to go there again sometime
<Angel_Espeon> 13so xD
<SilverSonic> Go to wisconsin ;-;

<Ray> 02Venezuela is Underated |D
<Sparky> still considering Tumblr
<Bakphoon> i personally don't feel it's really that bad here, it's just not good either
<Bakphoon> :V
<NightSeas> 12I live in the US and I think so :B
<Hipster_Brony> Fireflies can go straight to hell
<Bakphoon> you'd probably think a lot of places were overrated if you lived there
<Bakphoon> V:
<Armads> I live in the US but mentally I'm Australian.
<Armads> if that counts.
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't like Fireflies. But this parody is awesome.
<NightSeas> 12lol
<Bakphoon> the grass is always greener on the other side
<Manlyguy> There's just so many cultures meshed together, and that makes it kinda "eh" in terms of cultural value. It's only good for the national parks. . -.
<Manlyguy> I'm talking tourism here. lol
<Ghosties> dari: No
<prince-dari> Ghosties: Yes.
<Ghosties> Nigel Thornberry made Equestria Girls a mega hit
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just hope some woman doesn't try to have a conversation with me in Spanish this time
<Angel_Espeon> 13that was awkward
<Manlyguy> Learn Spanish. :L
<Angel_Espeon> 13Too much effort D:
<prince-dari> I'd be kind of insulted if I gave fans something that awesome, then had it turned into something that crappy.
<Bakphoon> lrn2espanol
<prince-dari> :P
<Armads> no, learn Italian.
<Armads> lol
<SilverSonic> Spanish > Italian
<Armads> Or Swedish. That's closer to English.
<Bakphoon> dutch
<Bakphoon> is close to english
<NightSeas> 12It just makes me face palm every time I hear about someone moving to the us from somewhere even nicer and saying their an American

<Ghosties> You did not just insult Nigel Thornberry
<Bakphoon> NightSeas, everyone wants to be somewhere else :V

<Sparky> I like living in the US
<Sparky> I'd also like to live in other places
<Armads> I'd rather live in not where I am right now
<Armads> I haven't been to all parts of the US so I'd bet not all of them are as godawful as this one
<Bakphoon> a lot of people in the US say they'd rather live somewhere else
<Bakphoon> like me
<Bakphoon> :V
<Sparky> where do you live, Armads?
<Armads> Soviet Florida.

<SirSprinkles> 6WHAT IS THIS?
<Armads> I like how Florida is called the Sunshine State when it actually just rains all the time.
<SirSprinkles> 6WHY?
<SirSprinkles> 6WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?
<Armads> states be trollin.
<Hipster_Brony> its for a thread im gonna put up in a little bit
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> Scootamoo.
<Bakphoon> the "city" i live near statistically has 1 black person (US Census)
<Bakphoon> :V
<Sparky> lol
<Armads> XD
<Bakphoon> it's like
<Bakphoon> 99% white
<Sparky> Bak
<Armads> My house statistically has one black person.
<Sparky> I live in a census defined place
<Armads> it's my brother.
*Armads runs
<Hipster_Brony> thats the joke, dari
<Sparky> :'D
<Bakphoon> uh
<Bakphoon> what you mean by that
<prince-dari> Yeah, I so I gather. XD
<Bakphoon> sparky
<prince-dari> -I*
<Sparky> it's not even a town
<Flutterpeanut> LOLWHAT
<Sparky> basically it means that where I live is horribly unimportant
<Armads> rofl
<Bakphoon> oh
<Sparky> and tiny
<Sparky> :'D
<Armads> so it's just a "place"
<NightSeas> 12The city I live in almost has no black people, it’s weird
<Sparky> and does not show up on GPSs
<Sparky> YEAH
<Sparky> IT'S LITERALLY JUST A PLACE
<SirSprinkles> 6You will link as soon as you put up that thread.
<Armads> so it's like Montana? :O
*Armads shot
<NightSeas> 12Yeah XD
<Bakphoon> eh, my town is kinda small
<Bakphoon> it's not that city that I was talking about
<Bakphoon> "city"
<Armads> no people, no roads, and who knows maybe not even any land.
<Sparky> LOL'
<Armads> just a place.
<Sparky> lol
<prince-dari> Where's Scootasue, she's epically overpowered.
<Manlyguy> So it's official? The US sucks?
<Hipster_Brony> part 2- Scootaroo: http://i.imgur.com/rSKea.jpg
<NightSeas> 12It sucks and it's grand at the same time :D
<Sparky> no
*NightSeas runs
<Sparky> it doesn't
<Sparky> it doesn't suck
<Sparky> it's just terrible
<Hipster_Brony> this would be even better if i could actually do photo editing well
<Sparky> jk
<Armads> it sucks grandly.
<Sparky> I like it fine
<Armads> :O
<Armads> or no, just florida.
<Sparky> then again I never go outside and nothing ever happens 'cause all we have here is dirt
<Sparky> and Texas
<Armads> Carolina was alright.
<Armads> Virginia was cool but f***ing expensive.
<SirSprinkles> 6Needs more Scootaglue.
<Manlyguy> :D
<Armads> even the dirt there cost like $80 plus shipping and tax.
<Manlyguy> For standing on it? lmfao
<Armads> and that's not even including parts and labor.
<Armads> no, just for the dirt to be there.
<Armads> If you wanted to stand on it, god
<Armads> that's a whole other loan.
<Armads> you gotta have a really
<Armads> really
<Armads> fat wallet to stand on dirt there.
<Armads> and god forbid you try to live in a house.
<Armads> you could literally
<prince-dari> What about the overly obvious Scootaloo? :P
<Ghosties> Scootaglue
<Armads> and I'm not making this up
<Manlyguy> lmfao
<Ghosties> Sprinks
<Ghosties> Scootaglue
<Armads> you could buy two or three houses in Texas or NC for the same price as one in VA.
<Ghosties> That's morbidly funny
<Manlyguy> All I had in my hometown was artichokes, strawberries, dirt, and apartments. And fat car mechanics.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Having a mini-nap in front of the computer is good |D
<Armads> and if you want a roof on that house, tack on another $500k.
<Angel_Espeon> 13And now I'm hungry
<Armads> ...k I'm done
<Armads> VIRGINIA IS EXPENSIVE IF I HADN'T MENTIONED THAT
<SirSprinkles> 6Or, if you feel like being punny and spelling it that way, Scootagloo.
<Hipster_Brony> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/36159727.html
<NightSeas> 12Everything is cheap in Arizona and New Mexico
<Armads> The town I was born in had more potholes than people.
<Armads> Potholes and liquor stores.
<Armads> (hint: it was detroit)
<Manlyguy> Everything happens in Detroit. lol
<Armads> rofl
<Manlyguy> Screw New Mexico. I just want to be in Mexico again. I actually have a house there, unlike here. $1,000 for a crappy mobile home, wtf.
<Armads> that's cheaper than virginian dirt.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Pasty~
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I broke the cap on the mayonnaise bottle
<Angel_Espeon> 13oops
<Armads> what did that mayonnaise bottle ever do to you :(
<Angel_Espeon> 13It refused to open properly D:
<Armads> maybe because it didn't want its brains extracted by the monstrous mayonnaise-craving beast of calamity.
<Armads> You monster.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I believe mayo doesn't have a say in the matter :3c
<Ray> 02brb, bath
<Angel_Espeon> 13Get in that bath, you smelly feesh >:/
*Angel_Espeon runs
<Armads> lol
<Bane> Heyooo
<Armads> and now you ignore its rights as a free and independent mayonnaise bottle.
<Armads> You are truly despicable. >:(
<Angel_Espeon> 13Implying mayonnaise bottles had rights to freedom and independence to begin with :P
<Armads> THAT IS HOW THIS SOCIETY HAS FUNCTIONED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME YOUNG LADY
<Armads> actually know wht
<Armads> what
<Armads> I just realized I hate mayonnaise.
<Armads> so nevermind.
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL

<Angel_Espeon> 13<3
<Armads> rofl
<SirSprinkles> 6Heyooo.
<SilverSonic> brb for awhile
<Armads> I found out a while ago that mayonnaise is made from eggs.
<SirSprinkles> 6Did my post win the internet?
<Armads> so that might be part of why I can't eat it :(
<Angel_Espeon> 13You didn't know? |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13Eggs are also tasty
<Armads> nope. lol
<Armads> I like, physically can't eat eggs.
<Manlyguy> That's possible?
<Armads> I try to put them in my mouth and my mouth is like

<Ray> 02[PC]
*Ray goes back to idleworld
<Ray> 02Killed the chat, my job is done :3
<Creideiki> A funny, and annoying thing to do to spam a real teletype is to repeatedly send linefeeds.
<Pattyrick> mint tears, makes me think of gravy rainbow
<Armads> \n
<Creideiki> (Not CR+LF, just LF. As the paper slew speed is hilariously fast... and you will annoy someone when half a roll of Expensive Paper suddenly goes shooting across the room.)
<Creideiki> \n is system defined.
<Creideiki> (You'd want to spam 0x0A.)
<Armads> ah, noted.
<Creideiki> Alternatively... you can spam 0x07 on any system to annoy people.)
<Armads> Armads learned something
<Armads> .
<NightSeas> 12~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ spam is the most awesome though
<Creideiki> (That's the bell code. :P )
<Armads> lol
<Armads> I wrote a program once that just played BIOS beeps, does that count? lol
<NightSeas> 12Since it’s a type of spam a lot of people like ~~~~
<Xanbreon> derp
<Creideiki> I locked a VT-100 terminal into bell spam mode. :P
<Creideiki> (To do that... send the following key sequence to a (real) VT-100: 04<ESC>[145q )
<NightSeas> 12Then there’s troll spam. You just find a subject people don’t like and spam it :D
<Creideiki> What that does is turn on the piezo speaker on the VT-100. ...Without turning it off.
<Creideiki> So basically that on a real VT-100 does: BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE- (until you power cycle the terminal)
<Armads> somebody's extra knowledgeable about this. lol
<NightSeas> 12Such as talking about how dang AWESOME Apple is
*NightSeas runs
<Creideiki> Also... another fun key sequence to send to a VT-100...
<Armads> Have I mentioned how much I hate lugia? :O
*Armads runs
<Creideiki> 04<ESC>[2;9y
<Pattyrick> so does Arti
<NightSeas> 12Hm? LOL
<Creideiki> Which puts it into permanent self-test mode. :P (I.e. it's like flicking the power switch three billion times a minute. :P )
<NightSeas> 12Arti is joking when she says that XD
<Pattyrick> according to her sig xD
<Pattyrick> I know
<Armads> Y U MAEK TST ??
<NightSeas> 12Too bad drf is not here o3o
<NightSeas> 12he's fun to troll :|
<Armads> rofl
*NightSeas runs
<Bakphoon> He's so easy to troll too :V
<Creideiki> Oh... one thing really funny about Apple...
<Angel_Espeon> 13Doing something to purposely annoy them is never good :<
<Xanbreon> drf is a magnet
<Creideiki> The aluminium keyboard.
<Armads> *always good

<Creideiki> You can install malware... on your keyboard. :P
*Armads runs
<Xanbreon> malware in ur malware being mal with ur ware
<Bakphoon> fcukin' magnets, how do they work
<Xanbreon> well mr and misses magnet have special alone time
<Xanbreon> the rest is biolagy

<NightSeas> 12And I put Nick instead somwhow :x
<Xanbreon> epic phail
<Xanbreon> So, did you get the answers you where looking for?
<NightSeas> 12Somehow*
<NightSeas> 12No, not even after the whois XD
<Xanbreon> What where you looking for?
<NightSeas> 12For some reason I thought you might be Espeon, but I was wrong I think
<Espy> I used to have that nick, wayyyback
<Xanbreon> ^__^
<NightSeas> 12So you are Espeon? lol
<Xanbreon> Am I?
<Xanbreon> Im not THAT one
<Angel_Espeon> 13I remember you~
<Xanbreon> Oh fantastic
<Xanbreon> :3
<NightSeas> 12Oh XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13First time I used the chat, I tried to use Espeon as my nick
<Angel_Espeon> 13but it failed because you had it registered

<Polarfire> thanks, I just try to coordinate with a few euro friends sometimes and it helps to know their time. But I've got it now thanks to dari.
<Xanbreon> :o
<Sparky> Chickens -> Eggs
<prince-dari> SirSprinkles: Does the clock adjust to the timezone of the person viewing it?
<SirSprinkles> 6I know, we pretty much have timezones wrong.
<Lati> 12...I will remember this.
<Sparky> :D
<Sparky> MUST
<Sparky> LEARN
<Sparky> MANDARIN
<Sparky> OLT
<prince-dari> The countdown timer on the site I mean.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Mandarin = type of fruit?
<Angel_Espeon> 13You want to learn the secret language of fruit
<Sparky> Mandarin as in the language of most of China
<Sparky> ... and Taiwan
<Angel_Espeon> 13But fruit > China
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<Sparky> lol
<Sparky> SOMEONE HELP ME
<SirSprinkles> 6...it goes off my clock.
<SirSprinkles> 6Or it should.
<SirSprinkles> 6Why, what's it say now?
<Polarfire> I would think it would be the same regardless
<Polarfire> since its a countdown and not an actual clock.
<Polarfire> like a timer.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a countdown.
<SirSprinkles> 6What's it say now?
<SirSprinkles> 6It should be 03:00:43:10
<Polarfire> 3 days 1 hour 43 mins
<Polarfire> hmm
<SirSprinkles> 6 1 hour?
<SirSprinkles> 6Oo
<Polarfire> yuo
<Polarfire> yup
<Sparky> I WANT TO DRAW

<Espeon> 06I can't see the word fruit without
<Lati> 12call 118
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari, what's it say for you?
<Espeon> 06I guess I'm too tired
<Espeon> 06SOMEHOW
<Espeon> 06nvm

<Angel_Espeon> 13Fruitsona
<Espeon> 06yes
<Polarfire> Dari why are you so good at coding? XD
<Lati> 12LOL
<Sparky> hmm
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'd be a strawberry |D
<Sparky> AG
<Lati> 12sounds like a persona
<Espeon> 06o-O
<Sparky> Sheena is a lemon
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari?
<prince-dari> Sorry, just a sec.
<SirSprinkles> 6What's it say for you?
<Polarfire> and yeah clock still says 1 hour for me...
<prince-dari> 02:19:41:00
<Espeon> 06Fruitsona is just a word that came to the world due to tiredness and mentions of the word "fursona" anyway, so it's supposed to be your SPIRIT FRUIT
<SirSprinkles> 6FUCK
<Polarfire> I got autokicked for sending too many messages.
*Espeon dies
<prince-dari> Why fuck?
<prince-dari> It adjusts to your timezone, that's good.
<SirSprinkles> 6Because that's WRONG
<SirSprinkles> 6No.
<Sparky> oh
<Sparky> uh
<SirSprinkles> 6That's BAD.
<Polarfire> It shouldnt adjust.
<Sparky> I dunno what I am
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a countdown.
<SirSprinkles> 6It shouldn't adjust.
<Lati> 12Okay lets try this again
<Polarfire> It would be incorrect.
<Lati> 12Cows > Eggs
<prince-dari> ...
<Polarfire> yeah^
<Sparky> Chickens -> Eggs
<Sparky> Cows > Eggs
<Polarfire> If stream is at 7 est, countdown should be the same regardless of timezone. Otherwise, it would be an hour off for me or 6 hours off for dari.
<Espeon> 06Cows > Eggs = Chickens < Cows
<Espeon> 06what
<prince-dari> ...Let me check this.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Cows > Eggs
<Lati> 12I love you all

*Aurora 6went way off topic there o.o
<drf-Droid> so why would you have them in an email?
<prince-dari> Oh, that's interesting. I think I'm the only one of our mods on right now.
<drf-Droid> EW LEAFEON AND GLACEON
<drf-Droid> ugly evos
<drf-Droid> don't exist to m,e
<Aurora> 6ok well they exist to me
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Aurora> 6they're quite nice
*Quanyails 7focuses on IRC.
<drf-Droid> that's a first
<Quanyails> 7Eh, this isn't the entire internet.
<Aurora> 6what
<ArmedDragon> hai
<drf-Droid> still, you usually talk for 2 minutes then disappear for 2 hours :P
<Prison> Have you ever been on Everypony?
<Quanyails> 7Indeed.
<Quanyails> 7Except when I lurk.
<Lambda> Hey Mikey
<Mikey> hi
<Aurora> 6no reason to complain about someone paying attention to other things
<drf-Droid> who said I was complaining
<drf-Droid> I was just pointing it out
<prince-dari> Hmm, nope, I haven't heard of it before, I think some of the other mods have though.
<Icy> idk
<prince-dari> Not 100%, I might have heard of it before.
<Icy> who the hell is that?
<Quanyails> 7Pointing out...
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Quanyails> 7Wish I could retort.
<Prison> Well, they're doing this "all day broadcast" soon. They really want to beat Celestia Radio.
<drf-Droid> what
<prince-dari> Where do you guys advertise? Ponychan?
<Aurora> 6best just to let it be

<Prison> Oh, I'm not a part of Everypony. I'm what you would call their competitor, actually (Rather, they call us their competitor)
<drf-Droid> I don't get how what I said was at all derigatory.
<Prison> I'm affiliated with Celestia Radio.
<drf-Droid> I was just pointing something out
<Prison> And 'Sup, Sprinkles :v
<Quanyails> 7Different topic:
<Aurora> 6fairly similar temperatures, that's good
<drf-Droid> it's like if I said the sky is blue and you went "why are you complaining?"
<Quanyails> 7Looking at Bechnokid's stuff.
<SirSprinkles> 6Not much... haven't slept since staying up after The Brony Show last night.
<Aurora> 6I'm getting worried about LA summer temps
<Quanyails> 7I want to draw expressions like his. D:

<Aurora> 6SO AGONIZING
<Quanyails> 7But I find my style not cartoonish enough. D:
<Aurora> 6to learn
<drf-Droid> I still need someone to do me an art favor
<Prison> But yeah, Everypony Radio tries so hard to be Celestia Radio. And they're being rather rude about it, as well.
<Aurora> 6I've been so busy these past several week
<Aurora> 6s
<Aurora> 6I lack time for anything ugh
<Aurora> 6speaking of which
<Aurora> 6I have 3 phones calls to make brb
<Prison> But that's another story. The point is, they don't like us for some reason.
<drf-Droid> WHY DID I MISREAD THAT AS 3 PONIES TO CALL
<HyperMetalLugia> Because you're haunted by them
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<drf-Droid> no thanks to people here
<Aurora> 6oh drop it
<SilverSonic> ^
<drf-Droid> now I feel like you guys are antagonizing me over nothing.
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6um, no
<Aurora> 6I'm not
*Quanyails 7snirks.
<drf-Droid> I just asked why I misread something
<drf-Droid> that's illegal now?
<prince-dari> drf-Droid: http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n192/DnDChick/OMGPONIES/FullOfPonies.jpg
<drf-Droid> no.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew
<Aurora> 6I was saying drop it when you said "no thanks to people here"
<HyperMetalLugia> Someone wipe that account
<Prison> Anyway, this stream seems pretty awesome, from what I've heard. Everyone holds you guys in high regards, and they say it's an event that people can really look forward to.
<Aurora> 6and once again, this topic is going o longer than necessary
<Espeon> 06I have to wonder why you would post that dari, but I'll just drop it there.
<drf-Droid> that was just a response to what HML said
<Prison> I can't wait for your next movie night! :v
<drf-Droid> and it was actually meant sarcastically
<drf-Droid> but nobody gets me
*drf-Droid cries in a corner
<Aurora> 6sarcasm + internet
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<SilverSonic> aint that the truth
<prince-dari> I posted it because drf misread phones for ponies? O_o
*SilverSonic shot
<Quanyails> 7Eh, I'm too nice for you, DRF.
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, trust me, I know plenty about the people being rather rude to try to be something else...
*HyperMetalLugia goes and gives DRF another corner with LL
<HyperMetalLugia> :)
<drf-Droid> LOL
<drf-Droid> LL's at work :m
<Quanyails> 7Try and get what that insinuates.
<drf-Droid> *:/
<drf-Droid> LOL m
<Aurora> 6oh god I forgot who else i need to call lol
<Mikey> oh ok
<drf-Droid> Quany, what?
<SirSprinkles> 6And you really should stop in this week, it's going to be a great showing.
<Quanyails> 7I'm nice. Don't push me (or anyone else, for that matter).
<prince-dari> What're you doing anyway?
<Mikey> at the moment I'm restocking my neopets shop
<drf-Droid> when you said "too nice for you" I was thinking dating lOL
*HyperMetalLugia pushes Quan off of a cliff and hides
<Quanyails> 7Good for you.
*Quanyails 7teleports on top of HML.
<Aurora> 6lol crap, my doctor's office is closed
*HyperMetalLugia has a new hat
<drf-Droid> o.o why the meanness all the sudden?
<Aurora> 6what was the third call I had to make x.x
<prince-dari> I contributed to that a couple times. XD
<Quanyails> 7I'm not.
<Quanyails> 7Yet. :3
<Quanyails> 7Maybe passive-aggression.
<Prison> I shall!
<Quanyails> 7Maybe.
<drf-Droid> "good for you" is generally not a nice statement
<Quanyails> 7Or just passiveness in the entirety.
<spyro17> well she has a blue picture of cynder and some guy 2 days ago said she was dead
<Quanyails> 7It's a neutral statement.
<Aurora> 6I think for now this topic should be dropped
<Aurora> 6both of you
<Aurora> 6since this is just about to explode
<Quanyails> 7Sure.
<drf-Droid> why would it explode? I'm not mad o.O but whateve
<drf-Droid> r
<Icy> ah
<SirSprinkles> 6You work with Celestia Radio, yes? Could I get a link to it?
<Aurora> 6I'm speaking from past experiences and knowing the people in this chat
<Aurora> 6so yes
<Prison> Sure. It's at ponify.me

<SirSprinkles> 6Is there a chat client there, I can't see it because it's not rated, and I'm submiting a request for it to be rated.
<Bakphoon> the anime tends to kind of roughly show size
<SirSprinkles> 6And I need to know what to request it as.
<Bakphoon> if even get close to "official"
<Aurora> 6also acknoledge that the anime, these are 10 year old kids
<Aurora> 6acknowledge
*Angel_Espeon wonders who is sending me lots of formspring questions o-o
<Angel_Espeon> 13Not that I mind or anything
<drf-Droid> so? LOL
<Aurora> 6and the official trainer height for most games is what....4' 5"?
<drf-Droid> take someone like sparky
<SilverSonic> it isnt me XD
*drf-Droid runs
<Prison> We have IRC chat, if that's what you mean.
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, good.
<spyro17> oh well die
<drf-Droid> hm, I might be thinking of Rhydon actually
<Icy> Umm ok?
<SirSprinkles> 6That tends to make it much easier for things to get approved, in my experience.
<drf-Droid> but that was epically epic in the anime
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Lyon.
<Aurora> 6rhydon is pretty big if I remember correctly
<Mikey> hey lambda I have a free trade that I can't get rid of do you want it?
<Aurora> 6 6 foot something
<Quanyails> 7Please tell me you're here. D:
<HyperMetalLugia> Wow

<Aurora> 6rhydon is 6'3"
<Aurora> 6which is fairly big for 1st gen pokemon
<drf-Droid> wtf
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<drf-Droid> I thought lots of gen 1s were big
<Aurora> 6not really
<drf-Droid> ex: dragonite
<Lambda> Sure

<Quanyails> 7Why are you never on?
<drf-Droid> the final evos
<Aurora> 6well
<SilverSonic> LOL AE I sent you a question on Formsprings :3
<Aurora> 6a lot of them seem like they should be biggwr
<Aurora> 6bigger
<Aurora> 6charizard for example
<Lambda> neopets, right?
<Aurora> 6only 5'7"
<Mikey> yep
<drf-Droid> yeah isn't charizar...yeah
<Aurora> 6shorter than me by an inch
<drf-Droid> in the anime it's huge
<drf-Droid> o_o me too
<Quanyails> 7Anime size discrepancy depending on the artist.
<Aurora> 6yeah again, ash is a 10 year old kid who's like 4' something
*Quanyails 7's trope-sense tingles.
<drf-Droid> LOL
<drf-Droid> btw aurora
<Aurora> 6but yeah, the anime (especially the movie animators) will make pokemon bigger than normal
<Prison> Sorry if this is a silly question, but what do you mean by "rate">
<Aurora> 6pidgeot was HUGE in the first movie
<Prison> ?
<drf-Droid> do you like the idea of making an AMV tribute to Ash with the song I'll Make a Man Out of You?
<Aurora> 6it's 4'11"
*drf-Droid hides
<SirSprinkles> 6It's firewalls in public cafes.
<Aurora> 6oh god
<Aurora> 6do it I swear to god, do it
<drf-Droid> k
<SirSprinkles> 6They block sites that aren't recognized.
<drf-Droid> want to help
<Aurora> 6lol
<Quanyails> 7o_O
<Aurora> 6how so
<drf-Droid> I need ideas for scenes
<Quanyails> 7Ah, AMVs.
<Aurora> 6k I'll think of some if I can
<Angel_Espeon> 13Dammit SS, that's a difficult question to answer LOL
<drf-Droid> OK
<SirSprinkles> 6So all you generally have to do is ask for it to be recognized and they'll unblock it usually.
<SilverSonic> :3
*Quanyails 7randomly applies Sturgeon's Law.
<drf-Droid> what did he as
<drf-Droid> k
<Mikey> feel free to raid my shop too I have a bunch of crap in there right now
<Aurora> 6but scenes usable for something like that can come in nearly every episode lol
<Lambda> was it the gift you just gave me?
<Lambda> hahaha, will do
*SilverSonic likes asking hard questions :B
<Lambda> I do love raiding shops
<Mikey> idk what was it called
*SilverSonic shot
<Prison> Oohhh, okay.
<Angel_Espeon> 13What are my top 5 favourite Nintendo songs
<drf-Droid> Sturgeons law is the one that basically said 99% of things suck, right?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm never capable of picking a top 5 for anything .w.
<spyro17> i mean bey
<SilverSonic> well, try ;3
<SirSprinkles> 6Which is something I like to go around and do, so everypony that uses public cafes everywhere doesn't get blocked later on when they go to go to pony sites.
<Quanyails> 7Ah, nope.
<Quanyails> 7Brb.
<drf-Droid> can I ask dirty questions?
*drf-Droid runs
<Quanyails> 7Gosh, dinner is late today.
<SilverSonic> No Drf.
<Mikey> also here it's the first one listed http://www.neopets.com/island/tradingpost.phtml?type=browse&criteria=owner&search_string=avalonskynoise
<SilverSonic> :P
<Prison> Gotcha.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Can I include remixes and such rather than just originals?
<SilverSonic> yesh :B
<drf-Droid> I didn't ask you SS
<SilverSonic> ;P
<Espeon> 06Lol
<Espeon> 06Not like people can't just ignore questions they do not feel like answering :P
<Lambda> offer made
<Mikey> yay thanks
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles makes the world a better place for bronies
<Aurora> 6top 5 nintendo songs
<Aurora> 6that's just as bad as asking what my favorite 5 touhou songs are
<Prison> What a dreamboat.
<SilverSonic> XD
<prince-dari> Lawl, I don't know any nintendo songs, and I have no idea what touhou is.
<drf-Droid> I have exactly one favorite touhou song
<Angel_Espeon> 13I still don't know who my overall favourite Touhou characters are .w.

<SirSprinkles> 6I just need your voice, Prison.
<Aurora> 6warning, that takes a while to sort lol
<Prison> Was that a compliment, or do you really need my voice for something? xD
<drf-Droid> ...
<drf-Droid> just when I thought I fixed that router
<SilverSonic> LOL
<SilverSonic> and it failed
<SilverSonic> haha
<drf-Droid> I know right
<Lambda> Scumbag Lambda: complains about egg gelatin, buys it anyway
<drf-Droid> dd-wrt hates me

<Mikey> lmao
<SirSprinkles> 6XD A compliment.
<drf-Droid> also LOL @ this teacher
<SilverSonic> i somehow misread that as d-wart
*SilverSonic shrugs
<drf-Droid> spending a whole hour on l'hopital's rule
<drf-Droid> that takes like two seconds
<Prison> Oh, bwahaha. The reason for my asking is because a lot of bronies are asking for my voice in projects :v
<Aurora> 6crap
<Aurora> 6my friend didn't get his tickets for HP7 in time
<Aurora> 6not that I thought he would, he waited too long

<Aurora> 6I just need to remember to charge my phone for irc
<drf-Droid> darn it aurora, speaking of HP
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, we're not exactly doing anything of the sort... though I'll be sure to remember you should something come up... which is unlikely. : D

<prince-dari> What's the rush?
<drf-Droid> and o.o @ cell jammer, why would they have one in movie theaters
<Aurora> 6dunno, how badly do you want to see it with a friend/ how badly does your friend want to see it?
<Prison> Cool beans xD

<drf-Droid> *e
<HyperMetalLugia> Same :)
<drf-Droid> was like first in line
<drf-Droid> because most people
<Aurora> 6opening weekend != midnight showing
<prince-dari> I always arrive at least 20 minutes late for films.
<drf-Droid> don't bother to see it in imax
<Prison> Yeah, the rest of the team is notorious for being late in responses xD
<Aurora> 6midnight showings are insanely hectic
<HyperMetalLugia> All our theatres here are single screen lol
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<drf-Droid> what's the hurry?
<drf-Droid> @ midnight
<Aurora> 6granted, you'll still get lines on opening weekend here, but not nearly that bad
<Aurora> 6um
<Aurora> 6it's not a hurry
<Aurora> 6it's just for fun
<Quanyails> 7Back.
<Lambda> That would be my handiwork
<Aurora> 6plus, I'm THAT excited
<drf-Droid> waiting in line all day is fun?
<Aurora> 6it's interesting, midnight showings
<Aurora> 6um
<Aurora> 6yes
<drf-Droid> that's news to me
<drf-Droid> well
<drf-Droid> I'm impatieng
<drf-Droid> so
<drf-Droid> *t
<Quanyails> 7Not just waiting, I assume.
<Aurora> 6people in line make groups and hang with each other
<Quanyails> 7Communicating as --ye
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<drf-Droid> ew socializing with people IRL
*drf-Droid runs
<Aurora> 6the girl right in front of me, she made a ton of food, based on the actual foods from the series
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Quanyails> 7I mean, who wants to see the YGO movie unless LittleKuriboh's there? XD
<Lambda> I ejoy making lame puns, they do lend a hand to fixing boredom
<Aurora> 6^lol
<SirSprinkles> 6*shrug* Nopony's perfect.
<drf-Droid> who what
<HyperMetalLugia> ^ Same
<drf-Droid> also: correction
<prince-dari> Come on guys, these jokes are getting out of hand.
<Quanyails> 7At whom, HML?
<HyperMetalLugia> I lost interest in that show
<drf-Droid> who wants to see the YGO movies
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF
<HyperMetalLugia> After the first round or series, I dunno XD
<Aurora> 6anyways point being
<Aurora> 6midnight showings seem ridiculous when you have to stand in line for ages
<Angel_Espeon> 13I hate when Google decides not to search something when I type it in and press enter
<HyperMetalLugia> Ah
<HyperMetalLugia> Google instant fail
<HyperMetalLugia> Keep trying :P
<Aurora> 6but when you bring blankets, food, laptops with movies, games, more food, make friends, etc
<Aurora> 6it's awesome
<Lambda> I'm sorry, let me offer my hand as an apology
<drf-Droid> anyway aurora do you think waitng a week will make it less fun due to hearing a million people say how awesome it is?
<Aurora> 6and it wont be super freezing this year LOL
<Aurora> 6yep
<drf-Droid> so what would you suggest I do
<Aurora> 6 17:55	Aurora	dunno, how badly do you want to see it with a friend/ how badly does your friend want to see it?
<Prison> They're good bros, though.
<drf-Droid> not sure @ the second part
<drf-Droid> but
<Prison> They made the station the best on the intertubes :T
<drf-Droid> the imax is like a 45 minute drive
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, I'm sure. It comes with the territory.
<drf-Droid> so it's kinda boring to go alone
<Angel_Espeon> 13gahhh I hate my stupid dodgy mouse and its stupid double-clicking thing
<drf-Droid> inb4 "here, take this"
<Aurora> 6find out if your friend will be offended if you go without them
<SirSprinkles> 6You have skype, yes? Can I get your info, in case I care to get in contact with you later?
<drf-Droid> I could ask
*Angel_Espeon is now forced to start the TohoSort all over again
<SirSprinkles> 6For... whatever reason. :/
<prince-dari> It's unfabulous to go alone, here tak this.
<prince-dari> It's uncool to go alone, here take this.
<SirSprinkles> 6Or vice-versa.
<HyperMetalLugia> lol dari
<HyperMetalLugia> It's stupid to go alone, take this (textbook)
<prince-dari> It's dangerous to go alone, here take this.
<Prison> My Skype is lucas.hakes
<SirSprinkles> 6Awesome.
<prince-dari> It'd difficult to go on your own, here take this.
<Quanyails> 7On another note, I'm watching SPUF.
<Aurora> 6spuf?
<Quanyails> 7Forums.
<Quanyails> 7Specifically:
<Quanyails> 7There's a spambot on the loose.
<Aurora> 6oh lovely
<Quanyails> 7Not these forums, 'course.
<drf-Droid> spambots are awesome
<Lati> 12My hand is so ITCHY
<drf-Droid> if used properly
<Aurora> 6dunno, it would have to be approved by the admins on the site
<Aurora> 6so
<drf-Droid> no, I don't mean that
<Aurora> 6course, if it goes into galleries, I'll be screwed over lol
<drf-Droid> for example

<drf-Droid> vote for what you want to see us air on TV
<drf-Droid> send in a spambot

<Quanyails> 7Oy, those.

<SirSprinkles> 6Totally not.
<SirSprinkles> 6Or anything.
<prince-dari> If you went through the trouble of setting up a botnet, I doubt you'd use it for that.
<SirSprinkles> 6Me. A troll?
<SirSprinkles> 6Noooooooooooooooooo.
<Prison> I don't go on Ponychan that much, and if I do it's usually in bursts.
<drf-Droid> what if you already had one
<Prison> I never really felt a strong connection with image boards.
<drf-Droid> and I love that people are taking me seriously
<prince-dari> Meh, I suppose.
<Prison> But das' jus' me.

<drf-Droid> all I've ever done was use an auto clicker to click the vote button once a second and left my PC on overnight.

<HyperMetalLugia> well, I'm not sure if I can do that to my router either
<HyperMetalLugia> I'll check
<prince-dari> 65535? Why is the internet not just an exploded spam can?
<Prison> There aren't many collaborative projects that I'm not already a part of in some way, shape or form xD
<drf-Droid> prince-dari
<drf-Droid> because ipv6 is in hex
<drf-Droid> so it gives you a block of FFFF

<drf-Droid> "the battery is about to die" but then it beeps and vibrates
<drf-Droid> which wastes battery

<drf-Droid> what
<Bakphoon> it's better than mine, my phone actives "power saver" which turns the backlight up to 100% and i can't turn it down
<drf-Droid> LOL wtf
<Prison> I was wondering if you guys wanted to implement the announcer voice at the beginning of each race. "3, 2, 1, GO!!!"
<Bakphoon> i know right :V
<HyperMetalLugia> That is why you should get a iPhone, it has great battery life (because it is so underpowered)
<HyperMetalLugia> :)
<Bakphoon> also it periodically beeps and turns said screen on to tell me light is low
<Prison> Or maybe a voice for the character selection screen.
<Bakphoon> er
<Bakphoon> battery
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Bakphoon> i liked my ipod touches when i had them
<Bakphoon> ipods touch
<Bakphoon> that would probably be more correct
<drf-Droid> y u have more than one
<drf-Droid> even one
<drf-Droid> is bad enoug
<drf-Droid> h
<Bakphoon> i had a first gen and i liked it but i lost it
<HyperMetalLugia> Good :D
<HyperMetalLugia> I got a iPod nano 4th gen for free :

<drf-Droid> Katy Perry kissed a girl and she liked it, does that make it OK?
*drf-Droid runs
<HyperMetalLugia> But I didn't want it
<HyperMetalLugia> maaaybe
<Bakphoon> and then a couple years later i got a 4th gen and i took it back because i decided i'd rather have other things
<HyperMetalLugia> Problem?
<Bakphoon> i had the iPod touch 1st gen before the app store
<Hipster_Brony> 8hmmm... im not sure
<Bakphoon> back when there was no reason to have one lopl
<Bakphoon> besides jailbreaking
<Bakphoon> which i did
<Hipster_Brony> 8you should post in the thread, i think star dream was looking for some kind of voice actor

<drf-Droid> bbl class is over
<drf-Droid> and ^

<Bakphoon> there's not too much that competes with them anyway
<Bakphoon> basically it's a phone without the phone
<Bakphoon> smartphone that is
<Mikey> gonna go eat and watch something bbl
<HyperMetalLugia> I see
<Bakphoon> and you can even use it as a phone via skype
<Bakphoon> :V
<HyperMetalLugia> Big deal?
<HyperMetalLugia> What happens if
<HyperMetalLugia> No wifi ;p
<Bakphoon> oh no?
<Prison> Alright, thanks.
<Bakphoon> the thing is
<HyperMetalLugia> A real phone has 3G or whatever they used/use now
<Bakphoon> it costs half as much as a normal smart phone and it has no contract
<Bakphoon> less than half
<Ascendant> lolwut
<prince-dari> But...It isn't a phone, and it's too big.
<Bakphoon> >too big
<Bakphoon> pff
<Bakphoon> have you seen some of the "phones" they make
<prince-dari> I haven't seen any bigger than a 3DS, no.
<Bakphoon> oh they make them
<Bakphoon> :V
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't know what you're talking about
<Bakphoon> imagine a phone the size of your hand
<Bakphoon> they make those
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh
<HyperMetalLugia> You mean the 80's models?
<Bakphoon> no
<HyperMetalLugia> I loved them :)
<Bakphoon> they make smartphones

<SirSprinkles> 6Oo
<SirSprinkles> 6Wut?
<Aurora> 6the closest I ever got to losing it with someone
<SirSprinkles> 6And yes, I saw.
<Aurora> 6said person complained about me
<SirSprinkles> 6But... wut?
<Aurora> 6my team leader talked to me about it
<prince-dari> I agree.
<prince-dari> Wut.
<Aurora> 6and when I told him the story, he was like "I figured that's what happened" and took my side
<Aurora> 6and walked away
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm heading out for the night guys. Talk later.
<Light_Latias> 12what'd they say about you? o.o
<prince-dari> Cya.
<Hipster_Brony> 8alrighty, see ya tomorrow spinkles
<Aurora> 6basically I was refusing to give my last two medium sized bags to a woman who bought 6 2-liter sodas
<Aurora> 6I put her bottles in a large bag instead
<Aurora> 6because that would have made more sense, yes?
<Aurora> 6she started raging that I wasn't giving her my mediums
<Aurora> 6when I told her they were my last, she said "well I think I deserve to have them no? where else are they going to go?"
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Aurora> 6I awkwardly looked at the people who were in line behind her, and they were all watching and listening lol
<Light_Latias> 12oh, you got a selfish one :P
<Aurora> 6I wound up giving her the bags just to get her to leave
<Ascendant> o_O
<Aurora> 6and thank god every customer in line after her was understanding, they were the ones apologizing instead of me apologizing for not having bags lol
<Drake> 04Well this sucks
<Ascendant> <Aurora> ascendant, kaiyou
<Ascendant> Ah
<Sneas> dick.
<SirSprinkles> 6Cya
*Light_Latias 12nods
<Light_Latias> 12I love it
<Drake> 04Apparently Dyan is a girls name
<Light_Latias> 12(and this sounds weird, I know)
<Drake> 04which means 'divine'
<Aurora> 6I'm currently having fun at work these couple weeks
<Light_Latias> 12when I get a rude person
<Light_Latias> 12everyone behind them sides with me
<Aurora> 6cuz I'm acting as a mentor to two new cashiers, and even better, two new leaders
<Light_Latias> 12nice :D
<Aurora> 6I'm basically training people who are in training to be my bosses lol
<Light_Latias> 12is that yours? :3
*Light_Latias 12hides
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<Aurora> 6Light_Latias	everyone behind them sides with me <-best feeling ever
*Light_Latias 12nods
<Drake> 04No it's one of my characters
<Light_Latias> 12I almost cried at how this one person treated me
<Armageddon> DRAKE
<Armageddon> DRAKE
<Armageddon> DRAKE
<Drake> 04Who is certainly not divine and is certainly not a girl
<Armageddon> DRAKE
<Drake> 04HI
<Armageddon> DRAKE
*Armageddon hugs
<Light_Latias> 12and everyone behind her, was giving her glares
*Drake hugs back
<Armageddon> GO READ TCTL
<Armageddon> :D
<Drake> 04WHY
<Armageddon> ):
<Light_Latias> 12I felt better XD
<Drake> 04http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/0/Dyan
<Aurora> 6you should see our store when our "visitor" comes in for a shopping trip
<Armageddon> haha
<Armageddon> What about Seran?
<Aurora> 6when I say store
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh mai
<Aurora> 6I mean store
<Aurora> 6basically, we have an old lady who comes shopping every now and then
<Drake> 04http://babynamesworld.parentsconnect.com/meaning_of_Seran.html
<Aurora> 6she takes a bus/taxi service to get here, because I think she's at a service home
<Aurora> 6anyways
<Aurora> 6she is literally THE. MOST. CRITICAL. Person you'll ever meet
<Armageddon> Rhy?
<Light_Latias> 12oh, a regular?
<Aurora> 6in your life
<Aurora> 6and your after life
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Drake> 04Rhy doesn't appear, only Rhys
<Aurora> 6she comes in once every month or so, her family tends to care for her otherwise
<Aurora> 6but when she DOES come
<Aurora> 6we get a phone call ahead of time
<Armageddon> >:
<Aurora> 6I'm not sure the whole story
<Aurora> 6anyways
<Light_Latias> 12she should be the DM then o3o
<Armageddon> but hey, Seran is a girl's name :D
<Armageddon> Syril is a girl's name too XD
<Aurora> 6our LOD, Leader on Duty, who basically runs the store when it's their day (we have 5 LODs hired)
<Aurora> 6is at guest services waiting for her
<Armageddon> how is Rathicus a girl's name >:
<Armageddon> he's the most manly guy ever
<Aurora> 6they either escort her around the store or have another high ranked person do it
<prince-dari> How is it a name? O_o
<Armageddon> ):
<Light_Latias> 12lolz
<Armageddon> how is it not a name?
<Light_Latias> 12she SOUNDS like a DM XD
<Aurora> 6the lady is so critical, the store will not let a newer member do it
<Aurora> 6not just for the lady's sake, but for the employee's sake
<Light_Latias> 12(District Manager, for those who don't know the term)
<HyperMetalLugia> Thank you LL :P
<Ascendant> o_O
<Aurora> 6she buys her stuff
<Aurora> 6and wherever she goes
<prince-dari> You ever seen a baby, asked "aww, what's he/she called", then been told "Rathicus, DESTROYER OF WORLDZ!!!!11!111oneoneonoeone"?
<Aurora> 6there tends to be an interesting amount of employee activity there in that area
<Light_Latias> 12o-o
<Aurora> 6specifically, 3-4 MORE people than normal
<Aurora> 6just in case
<Sneas> If you don' rape will occur.
<Sneas> t
<Aurora> 6when she's finally done
<Aurora> 6the escort takes her to the front lanes, where one of the more experienced cashiers (again, for the employee's sake, the poor newer people would die) opens up a completely new register for her, no line
<Sneas> WHAT THE FUCK.
<Aurora> 6the woman uses one of the motor seat carts
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh wow o.o
<Aurora> 6so while the escort emties that cart, yet ANOTHER employee gets a normal cart while the cashier rings this lady up
<Light_Latias> 12wow o.o
<Aurora> 6things "MUST BE BAGGED LIKE THEY SHOULD BE"
<Aurora> 6quoting her, she said that exactly
<Aurora> 6so we have to do guesswork as to how to bag them
<Aurora> 6the jist of it is that everyhting needs its own bag lol
<Light_Latias> 12you'd think the First Lady was there o.o;
<Armageddon> o_O
<Armageddon> roooofl
<Aurora> 6and if one thing is wrong, the cashier takes full force of her verbal assault
<prince-dari> She sounds lulzy.
<TurniBrony> Surprise.
*Sneas is hyper so lol.
<Aurora> 6after she's done paying, and giving out the last of her complaints, she goes up to guest services where she uses the phone to call her transportation
<Light_Latias> 12and waits D:
<Armageddon> ;o
<Aurora> 6which takes like half an hour to come, so the LOD stays with her and talks with her to keep her company
<Aurora> 6and then she leaves
<Aurora> 6on the rare occasions where the transportation company doesnt do things good enough for her
<prince-dari> She should have someone phone ahead of time when before she's finished shopping.
<Aurora> 6the LOD once had to drive her home
<prince-dari> So the transportation arrives as soon as she leaves.
<Aurora> 6dari
<Aurora> 6you don't understand
<Aurora> 6that's WRONG
*Light_Latias 12nods
<prince-dari> Wrong in what way? It's better.
<Aurora> 6and yep
<Light_Latias> 12that woman gets special treatment for her rudeness
<Light_Latias> 12>>
<Aurora> 6she's got a mental illness I'm sure of it
<Aurora> 6but in her mind, it's wrong
<Aurora> 6so we can't go against it
<prince-dari> I would argue that point with her forever.
<Aurora> 6basically though
<prince-dari> I'm pretty stubborn.
<prince-dari> Hey Turni.
<Aurora> 6within 2 minutes of the call that she's on her way, the entire store knows
<Aurora> 6and we're all ready for it
<Aurora> 6dari, then you wouldn't survive in retail
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<Aurora> 6I'm stubborn as heck, but I can put on the maid's mask
<Light_Latias> 12p-d
<Light_Latias> 12the customer is always right
<prince-dari> Nah, I'd get fired for arguing with her.
<Light_Latias> 12live by that phrase
<Light_Latias> 12or die in retail
<prince-dari> FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOREVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER
<Aurora> 6which in definition: we are dehumanized and are to do whatever the customer wants
<TurniBrony> Any of you still awake?
*Light_Latias 12nods
<Aurora> 6because we are retail employees, not humans
<HyperMetalLugia> Fun
<prince-dari> Don't you know, the customer is an idiot, they won't do what's best for themselves, you have to do it for them. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> So if the customer wants you to test out a new knife
<Light_Latias> 12'course
<HyperMetalLugia> You would cut yourselves/
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<Light_Latias> 12Hyper
<Light_Latias> 12within the bounds of legality
<Aurora> 6lol
<HyperMetalLugia> I know, but still :P
<prince-dari> Sprinkles just left.
<Aurora> 6but those bounds....are wide
<TurniBrony> Hello. What's up?
<Aurora> 6unfortunately
<Light_Latias> 12but just shy of that
<Light_Latias> 12is fair game
<TurniBrony> He predicted my comming, no doubt.
<Light_Latias> 12our only weapon is kindness

<Light_Latias> 12hai Danny
<drf|laptop> 03hi
<prince-dari> Meh not much, just trying to edit some modules for an IRCd.
<Aurora> 6but yeh
*drf|laptop is majorly freaked out right now .-.
<Light_Latias> 12speaking of verbal abuse
<Light_Latias> 12here he is
*Light_Latias 12shot
<Ascendant> ?
<Light_Latias> 12why? o.o
<Aurora> 6horrible people
<Ascendant> heya drf
<drf|laptop> 03basically
<Aurora> 6I deal with them
<drf|laptop> 03it has to do with my car
<Aurora> 6every day
<drf|laptop> 03and I don't know what to do
<drf|laptop> 03basically
<drf|laptop> 03I parked next to a lamp post, right
<Light_Latias> 12did you hit some-
<drf|laptop> 03and you know how the wheels are supposed to be like | |?
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I was kinda braindead after class
<drf|laptop> 03I get in
<drf|laptop> 03and back out
<drf|laptop> 03but I turn the wheel sharp to the left
<drf|laptop> 03well I hear this loud noise
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohai DRF
<drf|laptop> 03then go "crap, I was next to that pole"
<drf|laptop> 03but I get out, no dents or anything
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I now notice
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh fun o.o
<drf|laptop> 03if I have my wheel centered, the car drifts off to the right
<drf|laptop> 03so what I believe happened
<drf|laptop> 03was it shoved the wheel out of alignment
<drf|laptop> 03so it now sits like / |
<Aurora> 6my car drifts right too
<drf|laptop> 03so in order to go straight
<Light_Latias> 12oh jeez O_O
<Aurora> 6if the wheel is centered
<drf|laptop> 03I have to turn the wheel left
<drf|laptop> 03and keep it that way
<drf|laptop> 03But
<drf|laptop> 03Aurora
<drf|laptop> 03here's the thing
<TurniBrony> I see.
<Aurora> 6I also noticed that happens with our van too
<drf|laptop> 03every time I go over a bump or anything
<drf|laptop> 03it drifts a little
<TurniBrony> I noticed the new timer on top. Nifty.
<drf|laptop> 03because the wheels aren't parallel anymore
<drf|laptop> 03x.x
<Ascendant> ._.
<Aurora> 6I don't think a car can actually drive with wheels going like / |
<Aurora> 6if it does, not very far
<Aurora> 6that would break the axel
<drf|laptop> 03would it?
<drf|laptop> 03all I know is
<Link> did anyone translate that quit message XD
<drf|laptop> 03SOMETHING happened
<drf|laptop> 03and it's like
<Link> if not: Simsaya after you. He's after me. He's after. He must be killed. Japan got a gun under control. We are in total control And if it will be bad before anything crazy guy outside the club meeting, remember? I will never stop, we would like to inform Simsaya. We cf
<prince-dari> Yeah, Sprinkles added it, it's broken though. XD
<drf|laptop> 03it's not just the steering column that got screwed up, because as I said
<drf|laptop> 03if I go over a bump
<Aurora> 6as far as I know, that would cause the wheel to continuously go closer to the other wheel, since it's no longer paralell
<Aurora> 6parallel
<drf|laptop> 03it screws stuff up
<Link> Google translate fail?
<drf|laptop> 03like it goes ka-thump
<prince-dari> The countdown is wrong due to timezones.
<drf|laptop> 03rather than just thump
<eXAKR> Great
<drf|laptop> 03if you get what I'm saying
<prince-dari> We're fixing it sometime. Lawl.
<eXAKR> I need to restart my computer bbl
<Aurora> 6but i'm not saying you didn't do something wrong
<TurniBrony> :P
<Aurora> 6I'm just saying I don't think your tires ae / |
<Aurora> 6*are
<drf|laptop> 03and the / | thing is exaggerated a bit, that's just the limitation of my keyboard LOL
<drf|laptop> 03say if it shifted by like
<drf|laptop> 03a degree or two
<drf|laptop> 03I realize that's bad
<drf|laptop> 03hence why I'm freaked out
<drf|laptop> 03I can't tell my parents as what would I tell them?
<TurniBrony> That's what you guys get for living in the past. ;P
<drf|laptop> 03I know a guy, my former roommate, who worked as a mechanic for like 3 summers in a row
<drf|laptop> 03who's always offered to work on my car
<Aurora> 6still
<Aurora> 6yeah though
<drf|laptop> 03my mom's like "no, I'd rather take it to the dealership"
<Aurora> 6get it checked on
<drf|laptop> 03but eh
<drf|laptop> 03well
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<drf|laptop> 03here's what makes matters worse
<drf|laptop> 03I'm thinking, well if the wheel got shifted over to the right by driving into something
<drf|laptop> 03what if I drive into something th eother direction to forciblyh shift it back
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I missed a little
<TurniBrony> Like a timezone were Mel Brooks is still hip. ;P
*Light_Latias 12faceclaws
<drf|laptop> 03and ended up denting the part next to the passenger door
<drf|laptop> 03so the door now won't open
<HyperMetalLugia> Fail
<HyperMetalLugia> Epic..fail
<drf|laptop> 03so like
<drf|laptop> 03I now have a legit use for a crowbar
<Light_Latias> 12that was a STUPID decision...
<drf|laptop> 03to pry the metal out
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03when I say drive into something
<drf|laptop> 03I don't mean like crash into something
<drf|laptop> 03I mean
<drf|laptop> 03sit parked
<Aurora> 6that
<Aurora> 6...
<drf|laptop> 03with the car right next to a pole
<Aurora> 6I agree with LL there LOL
<drf|laptop> 03and then try to turn the wheel
<Light_Latias> 12regardless
<drf|laptop> 03if thath makes sense
<drf|laptop> 03-h
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Light_Latias> 12hitting ANYTHINY
<Light_Latias> 12*G
<Light_Latias> 12for ANY reason
<Light_Latias> 12with a vehicle
<Light_Latias> 12is stupid
<Light_Latias> 12x.x
<drf|laptop> 03yeah I know
<drf|laptop> 03two wrongs don't make a right
<drf|laptop> 03but I was hoping a left and a right would make center
*drf|laptop hides
<Light_Latias> 12then why do it?
<Light_Latias> 12-.-
<HyperMetalLugia> FOOLISH XD
<Kyu> 07why would you think screwing up the alignment could be fixed by screwing up the alignment the opposite way o3o
<drf|laptop> 03why not?
<drf|laptop> 03isn't that how it works?
<Light_Latias> 12if you loosened something
<TurniBrony> I'm actually quite surprised someone hasn't requested Space Balls yet.
<drf|laptop> 03it wasn't loosened., it was jolted
<Light_Latias> 12hitting it again would make it loose moreso
<drf|laptop> 03as I heard a loud noise
<drf|laptop> 03or something
<drf|laptop> 03well w/e
<drf|laptop> 03the door I can fix
<drf|laptop> 03I just need to find a crowbar
<Kyu> 07because if the wheel rotates, you can't tell exactly where the alignment is off
<drf|laptop> 03so I can pry it out
<drf|laptop> 03since it dented
<prince-dari> Sooner or later.
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<prince-dari> How do you feel about this week's line up?
<drf|laptop> 03is that something that's easily fixable though?
<drf|laptop> 03@ alignment
<Light_Latias> 12and then the dorr'll fall off :B
<Light_Latias> 12*door
<Light_Latias> 12bai Roara
<drf|laptop> 03um, no?
<Kyu> 07very
<drf|laptop> 03I said the part in fron tof the door
<drf|laptop> 03not the actual door
<drf|laptop> 03put it this way
<Steve> lul
<Steve> lul
<Light_Latias> 12hen the car will fall off D:
*Light_Latias 12shot
<Kyu> 07they do it free when you do a tire rotaion
<drf|laptop> 03the door has to go somewhere when you open it, right?
<Kyu> 07*t
<drf|laptop> 03wait
<drf|laptop> 03so
<drf|laptop> 03you think all that happened is I shifted the alignment?
<drf|laptop> 03rather than something actually bad?
<Steve> hey
<Kyu> 07you may have dented the wheel somewhat
<Steve> hey
<TurniBrony> Vidocq kind of piqued my interest. So I was kind of upset that it got snubbed.
<Kyu> 07but that would only happen if you were going fast enough
<Steve> hey
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03I wasn't
<drf|laptop> 03I was parked
<drf|laptop> 03and backed up at like 5mph maybe?
<drf|laptop> 03the odd thing is
<drf|laptop> 03I didn't even feel anything stopping the car
<drf|laptop> 03like
<drf|laptop> 03it was moving perfectly fine then THUD
<Kyu> 07so then it was just the alignment
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<drf|laptop> 03so what would you suggest, just go somewhere that does tire changes and ask them to fix my alignment?
<drf|laptop> 03I'd imagine all it needs is to be jacked up and whatnot?
<Kyu> 07pretty much
<drf|laptop> 03OK
*drf|laptop phews
<drf|laptop> 03I still mihgt ask my friend though
<Kyu> 07I don't remember how much it costs but it's not expensive
<drf|laptop> 03since he could do it for free

<prince-dari> Meh, Vidocq's not an A film.
<TurniBrony> Had any of you actually seen it? :P
<TurniBrony> Didn't seem like it.

<prince-dari> It's based on budget, not how good it is. :P
<nickstr> since I tend to think musically about audio its about the best method I can think of
<TurniBrony> Well didn't it have a budget of 50 million dollars-ish?
<TurniBrony> Not exactly pocket change.
<Sneas> Fuck, it's so damn humid here
<prince-dari> Can't remember now, but whatever it was, it was low enough that was decided it wasn't an A film.
<TurniBrony> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164961/
<Steve> hey
<Steve> lol hey
<TurniBrony> I guess if Starship Troopers with it's 100 million dollar budget wasn't enough to make the A cut. :P

<prince-dari> B films are different.
<prince-dari> They're sort of based on budget and how good the film is.
<prince-dari> We're looking to refine the system. :P
<Armageddon> o-o
<TurniBrony> You could say I have a very traditionalist view on what a B movie is and isn't.
<TurniBrony> So week after week I'm mostly in for quite a surprise for what passes as a B movie here. ;P
*Link falls asleep
<Link> (Not sleeping for reals :P)
<prince-dari> Hahaha,
<Link> I'm just suuuuuuuuper tired for some odd reason today x_x
<prince-dari> Well it's hard decided whether a film's good or not if none of us have watched it, and that's largely opinion too.
<TurniBrony> Evil Dead 2 I can agree with. The Room too and Battlefield Earth.
<Steve> why
<TurniBrony> The one last week I didn't see because I didn't see the first one.
<TurniBrony> The rest. Nope.avi

<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03k
<TurniBrony> Besides. Whenether a movie is good or bad has nothing to do with if it's a B movie really. :P
<prince-dari> Be aware, alcohol is everywhere!
<TurniBrony> It's more of a style really.
<HyperMetalLugia> No duh

<HyperMetalLugia> Hah
<HyperMetalLugia> Tons of brotherly love on the site then :P
<prince-dari> Next thing you'll be telling me that MLP is gay.
<Polarfire> wgat about you?
<HyperMetalLugia> Well...with all the rainbows and girl ponies
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe
<prince-dari> Which would be strange, since it's the manliest show in the world.

<HyperMetalLugia> Because iWindows runs iOS
<HyperMetalLugia> :)
<Polarfire> so watcha wana talk about?
<HyperMetalLugia> The sad thing is
<HyperMetalLugia> Even apple needs to use Windows
<TurniBrony> Well son, ever heard about scientology?
<prince-dari> It's true, similar to: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenWearPink
<Polarfire> no dad
<TurniBrony> Maybe someday when you're old enough I'll tell you all about it.
<TurniBrony> idk.
<Polarfire> aww man tell me now!
<TurniBrony> Go watch Battlefield Earth son.
<Roara|Dinner> 6frick
<Roara|Dinner> 6I clicked the tropes link
<Roara|Dinner> 6here goes my next hour
<HyperMetalLugia> well
<Polarfire> Alright now that the eating's done I can type.
<HyperMetalLugia> Couldn't you do the smart thing and just exit the window?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Polarfire> but I gotta wait till Friday!
<Aurora> 6not now that my interest is in it
<HyperMetalLugia> Remove the battery to your laptop?
<HyperMetalLugia> Or..wait
<TurniBrony> Aw well.
<TurniBrony> Oh. Favorite pony? Just to get that out of the way first. ;P
<Armageddon> o_O
<Armageddon> o_o
<Polarfire> tied for 1st: twilight and... RD I guess. tied for 2nd: AJ and Pinkie. 3rd fluttershy and last rarity XD
<Polarfire> out of the mane 6 or any?
<Polarfire> cause dj pon-3 would be in there somewhere.
<Polarfire> u?
<TurniBrony> >Background pony as favorite pony when the mane 6 are all well developed
<TurniBrony> >mfw
<Polarfire> oh and maybe derpy too.
<TurniBrony> >Mfw I have no face
<Polarfire> XD
<TurniBrony> Rarity, duh.
<prince-dari> Rainbow Dash first, Derpy second. :P
<Polarfire> so me n u are opposites huh. XD
<Polarfire> nm
<prince-dari> Twilight probably last.
<prince-dari> With Applejack.
<Polarfire> I like twilight because her character is halarious to me.
<prince-dari> I just think her personality is pretty dry, generic.
<Armageddon> ohai PTS
<prince-dari> Just another <insert average group leader> to me.
<Polarfire> yeah. But then again most of them have pretty generic personalities. They just present themselves well.
<Polarfire> Wow I feel stupid. XD
<Tyranico> Why's that?
<Polarfire> nevermind.
<Polarfire> you gotta see the conversation above it.
<TurniBrony> Probably for not having Rarity as favorite pony. ;3
<Tyranico> oh okay
<prince-dari> Rarity is under appreciated pony.
<Tyranico> I agree
<Polarfire> I don't like rarity because she reminds me of the type of people I hate irl. And I love rarity, but she's my least favorite out of the mane 6.
<TurniBrony> So you hate smart, successful and generous people?
<prince-dari> She's not exactly clever, she loses noughts and crosses every time.
<prince-dari> If you played randomly you'd probably do better than that. :P
<TurniBrony> Didn't know tic-tac-toe was a valid form of IQ testing. ;P
<prince-dari> If you were at all clever you'd work out how to play so that it's impossible to lose pretty quickly.
<prince-dari> :P
<Polarfire> I hate stuck up "sophisticated" people who refuse to open their minds. And rarity is canonly none of those, but that's just what her character reminds me of.
<TurniBrony> Pesant. :p
<prince-dari> Peasant* :P
<Polarfire> ok.
<TurniBrony> Well ok Prince DictionAri :P
<Polarfire> ugh.
<Polarfire> its so bad its good.
<Polarfire> moving on.
<Polarfire> umm.
<Polarfire> idk.
<TurniBrony> Now that Rarity is firmly established as best pony. We can change subject. ;P
<TurniBrony> idk. Movies? That's my solution to everything.
<Polarfire> Thanks dari!
<TurniBrony> RBD is just a cocky bitch. :P
<Polarfire> :p
<prince-dari> ;)
<prince-dari> I think we had this discussion before.
<prince-dari> Rarity is the best when in sonic rainboom. :P
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> What the hell.
<prince-dari> How did I typo that?
<prince-dari> bitch*
<TurniBrony> That was no typo.
<Polarfire> when she lets her pride completely get the best of her?
<Polarfire> yeah.
<Polarfire> sounds about right.
<Polarfire> and RBD has to save her falling ass?
<TurniBrony> Well. The writers *love* writing RBD as some sort of saviour of the world.
<prince-dari> Because she's justthatawesome.
<Polarfire> well she sure saved rarity's ass :p
<TurniBrony> She's a bitch. I have no idea why everything she does everyone will just let slip. Noone else would've gotten away with it.
<Sneas> 03Martinsburg WV
<prince-dari> What has Rainbow Dash ever done? :P
<prince-dari> You let slip how much of a bitch Rarity is sometimes.
<Polarfire> she's the only pony who I will proudly display her cutie mark on the back of my car.
<Link> XD
<Sneas> 03Morgantown
<Sneas> 03*
<TurniBrony> Ok. How about Fairweather Friends.
<Polarfire> and she's bi.
<TurniBrony> Thinking that AJ would trip her.
<prince-dari> AJ thought Rainbow Dash would trip her too.
<Sneas> 03or nearby
<TurniBrony> Nope.avi. Not when she noticed what she stumbled on.
<prince-dari> ...Do you want me to get the clip?
<prince-dari> They both think the other tripped them.
<Polarfire> GO GET IT
<TurniBrony> Go get it

<TurniBrony> Glasgow?
<TurniBrony> ;D
<HyperMetalLugia> Wow
<prince-dari> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> How slow can we get
<Polarfire> I hang out with the people who would make potential bronys. I told one of my most open minded friends and he doesn't talk to me anymore hardly. atleast its not the same.
<Polarfire> Where I live at people get beat up, literally, for being gay.
<Polarfire> How do you think they would like it if I told them I was a brony?
<Polarfire> My group of about 5 friends are the most reasonable people about stuff like that, and 1 of the 5 has already rejected me for being a brony.
<Polarfire> and no. try texas.
<Polarfire> :P
<Polarfire> so trust me when I say there's no bronys where I'm at.
<Polarfire> Period.
<TurniBrony> Well cry me the Missisipi. Atleast there's bronies in your state I'm sure.
<TurniBrony> I remember the brony map.
<Polarfire> Several hours away in dallas yeah there is some.
<Polarfire> But I cant drive 6 hours just to go see a brony.
<TurniBrony> Case in point. You guys could organize a meeting. Hang out somewhere and meet halfway.
<TurniBrony> I'd have to buy a planeticket.
<Polarfire> the 10 bronies that may come out of the dallas area aren't going to drive halfway to meet one me :p
<TurniBrony> They might.
<Polarfire> they won't.
<TurniBrony> So you'll have to excuse me if I'm not crying on your behalf. :p It's better than nothing.
<prince-dari> In the UK if there are any bronies, they're close by. XD
<Polarfire> lol.
<TurniBrony> Forever a pone
<Polarfire> And I'm not trying to get sympathy from anybody. just trying to prove myself when I say there's no bronys out here.
<TurniBrony> There's allways bronies in the US.
<Polarfire> *relative size of US compared to norway*
<Polarfire> just convert some.
<TurniBrony> I'm pretty sure if you looked up in the brony map... if it's still around. You'd find some.
<Polarfire> I've already tried converting and id didn't work for me.
<TurniBrony> I'm not forcing some guys to watch a show just so I can say I have brony friends.
<Polarfire> maybe you'd have better luck.
<TurniBrony> Also.
<Polarfire> You don't force them. If you force them youre doing it completely the wrong way.
<TurniBrony> *Relative size of brony fanbase in US compared to Norway'
<TurniBrony> Over 9000
<Polarfire> according to brony map nearest brony is 6 hours away one way.

<Altair> irssi + screen = best
<TurniBrony> He's looking up Rarity/RBD slash fics
<prince-dari> But really mIRC client is best client.
<Altair> but it's /all/ text
<prince-dari> Lawl yep, that's exactly what I was doing.
<Sneas> 03oooooooooooo.oooooooooooooo
<Steve> 12 Hello, Neo and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
*Link pops all but 2 of Sneas's eyes
*Link mauled
<TurniBrony> And I'm sure they're all horrible
<Polarfire> why don't you like fanfics turni?
<Altair> mirc is xchat with a fugly scripting language
<Sneas> 03oo.
<Lambda> The One
<Altair> :(
<Lambda> You have arrived
<Polarfire> granted yes most are crap.
<Neo> What happens if I fail?
<prince-dari> Do you want the blue pill, or the red pill, Neo?
<Sneas> 03.oo
<Link> dammit XD
<Altair> but at the same time, it's easy
<Polarfire> but there are some that are really beautifully written.
<prince-dari> mIRC has the best scripting language.
*Link puts one eye on the normal eye spots
<Neo> Whichever one doesn't make me puke afterward.
<prince-dari> Easiest thing ever made.
<Neo> So, blue.
<Polarfire> especially some of the ones that get featured on EQ daily.
<Sneas> 03WHO DID THIIIIIIIIIIS?!
<TurniBrony> Why settle for something that will never be as good as the show?
*Sneas runz
<Polarfire> I've found some that are.
<Altair> meh
<Polarfire> Have you ever read any?
<Link> Altair: Sneas's party theme http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axJpBlxW6n0
<Altair> perl is superior in features, but mIRC is easier.
<Link> XD
*Link RUNS
<TurniBrony> I have actually.
<prince-dari> Features? What can't you do with mIRC?
<TurniBrony> I dove into them when I had a troll-fic project going.
<Polarfire> and it gives us something to do while we wait for season 2.
<TurniBrony> Found some pretty weak stuff that was proudly featured on EQ Daily.
<Polarfire> and some of the origin stories etc. are really really creative and original.
<TurniBrony> Gimme a break. It's no substitute at all.
<Altair> for one, interacting with outside programs is usually a no-go, unless you do something GTSDLL style
<Polarfire> How long ago was the project?
<prince-dari> I'm sure you could do it with sockets.
<TurniBrony> Theoreticly it's still ongoing
<prince-dari> Might be a bit complicated though.
<Altair> well, for example
<Altair> my !lag script
<Altair> for mIRC was around 40 something lines if I recall
<Altair> i used to have one for Xchat as well, that was around 10 in perl
<prince-dari> I bet I could get it to less than 10 in mIRC.
<Polarfire> Ok well you can watch season 1 over and over and over.
<Polarfire> I just like it because atleast its something new.
<TurniBrony> The whole idea of it was to try to parody some of the elements of the fandom and especially fanfics. I'd write it under a pseudonym and everything.
<Altair> it could be done by putting multiple commands on one line
<Altair> :P
<Lambda> I actually just watched the Matrix Saturday
<Altair> what i'm saying is that mIRC's language is easy for simple tasks
<Altair> i.e. static remotes or random output remotes
<TurniBrony> And make a point out of never writing while sober.
<Altair> but for more advanced scripts, python/perl are bettar
<prince-dari> For IRC I'd maintain mIRC script is better in almost every situation.
<Polarfire> you still lurking dari?
<prince-dari> Yep.
<Polarfire> add something.
<Altair> for 90% of remotes, yeah
<Polarfire> please
<Polarfire> anything
<prince-dari> I don't read fanfics. Other than I read cupcakes.
<Polarfire> oh god.
<Polarfire> dont go there.
<Polarfire> XD
<Altair> but remotes aren't the only kind of script :P
<TurniBrony> Pft. Please. Cupcakes was just bad. And not in any way scary.
<Armageddon> ALTAIR
<Armageddon> ALTAIR
<Armageddon> ALTAIR
<prince-dari> Maybe you didn't read the one with proper spelling and grammar, it was very funny.
<Armageddon> anyway
*Armageddon poofs to deal with some ddos attacks
<prince-dari> Best puns ever.
<Altair> herp wat
<TurniBrony> I read the one that was preassured onto EQ Daily.
*Armageddon hugs Altair
<Armageddon> missed you ;-;
<prince-dari> I dunno which that is.
<Polarfire> Well, since everyone else's writing is so bad let's see what some good writing looks like, hmmm?
<Polarfire> I know, how about some of yours?
<TurniBrony> Sure.
<Armageddon> [13:59:23] <~Altair> it's actually awesome
<Armageddon> [13:59:35] <~Altair> irssi + screen = best
*Altair hugs back
<Armageddon> EW IRSSI
<Armageddon> ;-;
*Altair is using it
<Armageddon> why
<Armageddon> D:
<Altair> i was like
<Altair> what the fuck
<TurniBrony> Oh that's the weakest argument known to mankind.
<Altair> i lost a /ton/ of shit
<Armageddon> ._.
<Sneas> 03DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD:
<Altair> so why not experiment
<TurniBrony> I never claimed once to be a writer.
<Altair> yeah.
<Armageddon> get konversation then
<Altair> ~750gb of data
<Altair> LOL fuck no
<Armageddon> or fucking using mIRC on wine :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!
<Armageddon> use*
<Armageddon> konversation is a piece of shit
<Armageddon> or use pidgin
<Altair> kde branded apps suck loolol
<TurniBrony> But you don't have to be a master chef to know that some food taste bad.
<Armageddon> KDE is a fuckshit
<Altair> nah
<Armageddon> hate it
*Sneas is using mIRC on Wine nith no lag :3
<Altair> hah
<Armageddon> >:(
<Armageddon> lmao
<Altair> KDE used to be /the/ shit
<Altair> like
<Altair> KDE 3ish
<Armageddon> KDE sucks now lol
<Altair> and 2
<Armageddon> I still hate it anyway
<Armageddon> Gnome <3
<Altair> it was original and awesome back then
<Altair> now it sucks
<prince-dari> Maybe to appreciate all the subtle flavours in a really good dish you do. :P
<Altair> lol gnome
<Altair> sucks too
<Altair> :3
<Armageddon> Gnome is a bit bloated
<Polarfire> taste is opinion :p
<Armageddon> but it's nice
<Sneas> 03GNOME, LXDE and XFCE ftw to me :3
<prince-dari> Analogy - shattered. XD
<Armageddon> XFCE <3
<Polarfire> that's my arguement.
<Altair> tbqh
<Armageddon> and LFCE or something
*Armageddon forgot the name
<Sneas> 03LXDE = best to me
<TurniBrony> Ok. You want some good writing?
<Altair> i don't like linux desktop enviroments that take over the system
<Altair> give me a window manager
<TurniBrony> How about... read a book?
<Armageddon> haha
<Altair> couple of extra progs, i.e. conky and xclock
<Armageddon> use windows' desktop environment then
<Altair> and i'm good
<Armageddon> :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Altair> hahaha
*Altair uses fluxbox and windowmaker
<Armageddon> haven't tried fluxbox
<Armageddon> >|
<Armageddon> is it good?
<Altair> it's super simple
<Neo> I've been watching it on and off since Sunday.
<Armageddon> so is gnome
<Sneas> 03Windows Linux X.
<Polarfire> mmm nah I'd still rather read what some really spectacular writing sounds like. I'm not going to mess around with silly old books.
*Sneas runs
<Altair> super simple = most settings are changed in config files
<Altair> lol
<Altair> cygwin
<Altair> :)
<Polarfire> Since you're not a writer, but apparently you know how to expertly judge a piece of writing, how some you haven't used these skills to write something of your own?
<TurniBrony> You're still going with that argument, seriously?
<Polarfire> yep. It's my favorite. Disprove it.
<Polarfire> you already tried once, give it another shot.
*Sneas porn
<TurniBrony> You got my point. You can't deny that.
*Altair is glad he didn't store that on the disk he lost
*Altair shiftyeys.
<Sneas> 03XD
<Armageddon> rofl
<Sneas2> 03brb switching computerz
<Armageddon> syslog is a bitch
<prince-dari> [05:12] * Altair uses fluxbox and windowmaker
<prince-dari> [05:12] <Armageddon> haven't tried fluxbox
<Armageddon> and Altair
<prince-dari> Managed to read that as "haven't tried windows"
<Sneas2> 03fuckbox
<prince-dari> Went wut.
<Polarfire> Yeah I understand your point, and it makes sense, and like I said 90% of fanfics are not worth reading. But don't dismiss the others immediately which seems to be what you are doing.
<Armageddon> ksoftirqd was being a bitch on shadow
<Armageddon> and nomming all the fucking CPU
<Armageddon> the load was at 9.x
<Armageddon> x_X
<Armageddon> haha
<Altair> lol
<Armageddon> it lagged the server like fuck >:
<Altair> i like that vhost
<Armageddon> rsyslog was also being a bitch so I had to kill it
<Armageddon> haha
*Sneas2 wonders why mIRC eats up 99% of the CPU on the VM when it fucks up .-.
<Armageddon> because it tries to parse the shit
<Armageddon> and it freaks out
<Polarfire> You can't accurately judge what someone goes through in the writing process, especially not a good writer, until you've been in their shoes and written something worth reading yourself.
<Armageddon> and does its thing
<Altair> mIRC has a bad habit of going full retard
<Sneas2> 03Is someone abusing it or what?
<Altair> i doubt
<Sneas2> 03I kinda think the VM has a virus too
<Altair> usually the only time i had cpu/mem spikes in mIRC was when a large script was running
<TurniBrony> But what the person goes through to make something is to the general read... totally irrelevant. Only the ending result matters.
<Altair> that's what VMs are for
<Armageddon> Altair
<Altair> :P
<Sneas2> 03weird sht happenz
<Armageddon> mIRC
<Sneas2> 03i*
<Armageddon> can't handle data
<Armageddon> and my !pokescramble script
<Armageddon> fucking freezes it
<Altair> i know
<Armageddon> a lot
<Armageddon> which is why it keeps freaking the fuck out
<Armageddon> heya Shiny
<Altair> remember the anagram script i had?
<prince-dari> The only time mIRC haCPU spikes for me is when I accidently screw up a while loop.
<Armageddon> oh yeah
<Sneas2> 03lolSKYLANDSIN#SPAM.
<Altair> every time someone used it
*Sneas2 runs

<Polarfire> I restore vehicles. Classic cars to be exact, as a hobby. Can you accurately give me a judgment of my work without having any experience to base your judgement on? People who judge a another's creation without seeing what went in to said creation are ignorant, IMHO.

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Help, dragon-lady squishing doggie
<Armageddon> I do read stuff like
<Armageddon> yaoi and lemon and shits
<TurniBrony> So basicly the logic you're basing yourself on is that noone can critique anyone, except their own peers.
<Armageddon> but I don't LOOK for it

<Armageddon> unfortunately you just lost it :3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Asshole :U

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Which is true
<Altair> !digimon
<Nightshadow|VNC> Altair, you are a 15Garudamon.
<Polarfire> That's why they are called "fanfiction"
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02They are not all horible

<Polarfire> FICTION
<Altair> hnnnng
<Polarfire> not canon.

<Armageddon> wat
*Altair never watched Digimon or played the games
<Armageddon> haha
<Armageddon> I've only watched
<Polarfire> Sometimes the point is not to follow the same style of the show. To do something different.
<Armageddon> Digimon Adventure 02
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I've only watched
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02All of them
<Altair> in fact
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Except 02
<Armageddon> and played Digimon world DS
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Because it was bad
<TurniBrony> Well, if you're just gonna disregard the show you're basing your fiction on. Why not just write something original instead?
<Altair> I never watched any of the Pokemon anime
<Armageddon> 02 was nice >:
<Armageddon> lol pokemon series
<Altair> and only the first two movies
<Armageddon> I watched them when I was a kid
<Armageddon> shockhorror
<Altair> ^
<Altair> i was 8 i think when the first one came out
<Altair> good memories
<Polarfire> So you can use a predeveloped batch of characters and not have to completely create a new world.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 0202 was basically the same episode with just a little changed(Lol like Pokemon)
<Polarfire> and to entertain other fan's of said show.
<Altair> ... now thanks to rule34 those memories are slightly tarnished
<Altair> but still there
<Polarfire> Its something they can relate to.'
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Find a dark spire - destroy it - some plot maybe - go home
<Armageddon> lmfao Altair
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Rinse and repeat
<Altair> ^
<Armageddon> yeah that was it Shiny
<Armageddon> it was very repetitive
<Armageddon> but Ken was awesome
<Armageddon> XD
<Altair> and I owned at least one of the games up until the latest gen
<Altair> which i pirated but never finished
<Armageddon> Altair the pirate
<Altair> Sadly I've lost interest in the games too lol
<TurniBrony> Well I sure as shit don't relate to Pinkie Pie carving up Rainbow Dash.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yar har twiddle dee dee
<Altair> all i do
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Being a pirate is already free
<Altair> is pirate

<Altair> quotes
<Armageddon> wb Sneas
<Altair> :D
<Armageddon> the second quote
<Armageddon> I just made up on the spot
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> first one is like, my favourite of all time
<Armageddon> alongside Sartre's "Hell is other people" and stuff
<Altair> i typically like the ones dealing with religion and government
<Altair> and law
<TurniBrony> "This cute show about pony friends needs more hardcore sex and brutal murders"
<Altair> etc
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I have sleep in my eye
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm 3/4 blind
<Altair> o_o
<Altair> hmm
<Altair> i wonder
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Meaning
<Armageddon> [14:36:22] <~Altair> i typically like the ones dealing with religion and government
<Armageddon> [14:36:23] <~Altair> and law
<Altair> how do i color in irssi
*Sneas has awake in his eye
<Armageddon> uh, no idea Altair
<Polarfire> "I'm going to makes these characters do something they wouldn't do normally, specifically to entertain other fans of this show"
<Armageddon> and lol religion and government
<Armageddon> law yeah
*Altair thinking in text.
<Armageddon> I like the ones dealing with freedom
<drf|laptop> 03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/funny-facebook-fails-strange-coincidence.jpg
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Watch out, I can't see crap, beware of random subject changes
<Armageddon> well, Altair, colour is binary code 03
<Altair> well, i doubt telling irssi that will make it color
*Altair hides
<Armageddon> lmfao
<Armageddon> http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/j/jeanpaul_sartre.html
<Armageddon> his quotes
<Armageddon> are fucking awesome
<Armageddon> "Everything has been figured out, except how to live."
<Polarfire> cupcakes was not very well written, I'll give you that. But the concept was interesting.
<Altair> 4test
<Altair> pl
<Altair> ok
<Polarfire> And of course it had the best puns ever.
<Polarfire> they by themselves were worth the read.
<Armageddon> "I tell you in truth: all men are Prophets or else God does not exist."
<Armageddon> lmao Altair
<Sneas> 8hello
<TurniBrony> Well how come I as a fan of the show was more entertained by a fanfic portaying the characters as they would be in the show. Rather than the slash fics, Cupcakes and other things I've long forgotten.
<Link> o-o
<Armageddon> heh
<Link> COLORS
<Armageddon> "Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does."
<Altair> i had a large collection of those wallpapers
<Armageddon> That's one of my favourites
<Altair> with quotes
<Armageddon> @ Altair
<Altair> <3
<Link> 3 o-o-o-o-o--o-o
<Armageddon> my favourite is still the freedom one
<Altair> my fav of all time
<Armageddon> "If freedom is outlawed, then only outlaws are free"
<Armageddon> that is the fucking best
<Altair> "Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks" -Dr. Dre
<Armageddon> rofl that
<Altair> and hey
<Altair> it's okay to be an outlaw
<Altair> :D
<Polarfire> Because you are boring and unwilling to explore the creative ideas of the show's fanbase, your fellow bronies, while still being able to enjoy the show itself like I am :p
<Armageddon> "Politics is a science. You can demonstrate that you are right and that others are wrong."
<Armageddon> that one makes me lol
<Armageddon> and yep :p
<TurniBrony> I sure must be a boring induvidual. Yup yup.
<PTS> !Digimon
<Nightshadow|VNC> PTS, you are a 6Machinedramon.
<Armageddon> but still
<Armageddon> freedom quotes are my favourite ones
<Armageddon> because often I can agree with them
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02We need some Dead Island music
*Shiny-Growlithe listens
<TurniBrony> Instead or reading a clop fic,. I could watch a porno. Instead of reading Cupcakes I could be watching Hostel ect ect.
<Armageddon> XD
*Armageddon makes lunch and a hot chocolate
<PTS> Dark master Ftw
<Armageddon> at fucking 2:45pm
<Armageddon> hell yeah
<TurniBrony> Instead of crude aproximations of other things with ponies in them.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02That's ironic
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I just had some mint hot chocolate
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Delicious minty flavor
<PTS> Damn it's like 40C here too hot for hit chocolate
<Polarfire> You just don't get the point of fanfiction. And no amount of arguing or debating will change you, so that's pretty much it I guess.
<PTS> :p
<PTS> Hot
<PTS> Hit chocolate lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Drink coffee or some caffeine drink
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It cools you down :P
<TurniBrony> So I bring up no valid points whatsoever?
<NightSeas> 12Hey Draelen!
<PTS> I have ac
<PTS> :D
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<Polarfire> not necessarily. but you don't understand the fundemental ideas of fanfiction. And like I said. I can't change that by proving or arguing anything.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Then it's not too hot to have hot cocoa now is it? :P
<TurniBrony> Right. Writing the characters IC. Get a load of that guy. :P
<Armageddon> it's fucking freezing here
<Ascendant> o_O
<TurniBrony> You know what. I'm gonna find that one.
<Link> Get a blanket :B
<Polarfire> That's the point of fan FICTION. to make established characters do something they wouldn't do CANONLY (as in fact)
<Polarfire> and the good ones will do this while keeping the characters IC/
<PTS> Hehe u Guys have winter
<TurniBrony> Yeah, well then there aren't really that many good one then is it?
<PTS> Armageddon do u Get snow
<Polarfire> dari u still lurkin?

<Light_Latias> 12blah you, Shiny D:
<Light_Latias> 12now I want cocoa x-x
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02?
<Polarfire> no, there's not. But to say you've only read one good fanfiction ever, and it was about a generic topic that could be featured in the show, is absurd.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It wasn't me who said it first
<Light_Latias> 12and it's like: 1
<Light_Latias> 12bgut you're who I saw first

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I want to draw
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But at the same time I'm too tired to
<TurniBrony> Hmmm.
<Armageddon> lmao Altair
<Armageddon> and Shiny
<Armageddon> do it
<Armageddon> :D
<Armageddon> Draw me a Dorugamon :3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm too tired
*Armageddon hugs it
<Polarfire> I finally show you that there is some good fanfiction out there, after a 2 hour long debate, and you tell me:
*Armageddon hugs Shiny too
<Armageddon> I want a Dorugamon
<Armageddon> >:
<Polarfire> The good authors should be aiming higher. That is all.
<Polarfire> Ok ok ok.
<Polarfire> haha
<TurniBrony> Well I allready know there is some good fanfics out there.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Tomorrow I'll draw it
<Polarfire> You are halarious.
<Polarfire> Like I said we've gotta do this again sometime.
<TurniBrony> I knew that before I knew there was someone named Polarfire
<Polarfire> do what now?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02if I remember
<Polarfire> you're talking about knowing about the good fanfics correct?
<TurniBrony> Yes. Under the pile of tragicly misguided induviduals, OC, shipping, sappiness and grimdark there is some stuff that may be worthwhile to read.
<TurniBrony> But I don't feel like getting the shovel and trek through EQ Daily: AKA: Shipping central.
<drf|laptop> 03wtf
<drf|laptop> 03Roara|Comic, apparently Target is having a "summer black friday"
<Polarfire> Well its a start I guess.
<Polarfire> I show up for the movie nights and usually every weeknight about the same time if you ever want to get together.
<Polarfire> You turned an otherwise boring evening into a fun little debate.
<Polarfire> Thanks for that.
<TurniBrony> One time I'd rather talk about movies. Since I like them.
<Polarfire> Ok, sure. Any topic I'm game for. As long as we have differing opinions about it :)
<Polarfire> movies sounds like it would make an interesting one.
<Roara|Comic> lol
<Roara|Comic> yeah they are
<drf|laptop> 03did you know about that?
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<drf|laptop> 03I'm just like wtf @ concept
<Roara|Comic> its an online thing though
<Polarfire> but lets save it for later.
<Roara|Comic> you wont find it in stores
<drf|laptop> 03you don't happen to know the deals offhand, do you
<drf|laptop> 03?/me runs
<TurniBrony> Allright
<drf|laptop> 03...fail
<Roara|Comic> no
<drf|laptop> 03kl
<Roara|Comic> I just know there's a crapton of stuff that's like...40% off
<drf|laptop> 03-l
<Roara|Comic> 20-40 probably more on some items
<drf|laptop> 03so in other words, the same price I've always been able to get it for at Amazon :D
<Roara|Comic> but as of now, I don't think the items on sale are public
<Polarfire> I've saved your name, and I always use the same name so I'll be around.
<drf|laptop> 03no they aren't
<drf|laptop> 03that's why I was wondering
<TurniBrony> Saved my name? Where, how?
<Polarfire> TurniBrony is in my notepad of people I want to talk to again.
<Polarfire> If that's ok.
<TurniBrony> Ok, I suppose.
<Polarfire> Its on an encrypted linux system if that's ok?
<TurniBrony> Linux?
<TurniBrony> Fuck that shit.
<Polarfire> Added that to my debate topics :)
<Polarfire> beside your name
<TurniBrony> No. I don't wanna talk about that. :P
<TurniBrony> Anyway. I use the same name on Ponychan.
<Polarfire> I want to hear your arguement for why its bad. But not right now! just later.
<Polarfire> I don't ponychan much.
<Polarfire> The internet love machine is crazy.
<Polarfire> I prefer 1 on 1 or small groups here anyday.
<Polarfire> But anyway I've gotta get up again in a few hours and go work outside before it gets to be 100 degrees, so I'll catch ya later?
<TurniBrony> Sure.
<Link> o-o
<Link> i havent seen that quit message in forever xD
<Polarfire> bye. I hope you enjoyed tonight like I did.
<Armageddon> blah
<Armageddon> bbl
<Drake> 04o-o
<TurniBrony> Shoulda watched Death Sentence instead. :P
<Drake> 04k
<Polarfire> You're.... I don't know what you are. Its not good.
<Polarfire> But I like it.
<TurniBrony> I was just kidding.
<Polarfire> I want to ttalk to you again.
<Polarfire> oh. haha.
<TurniBrony> I'll watch it tomorrow.
<TurniBrony> Yeah it was allright. Don't really get to debate much on Ponychan without people crying "love and tolerance"
<Polarfire> yeah and I like 1 on 1 debated better. or small groups. In ponychan if you put up a sketchy opinion you're going to get about 50% love and 50% people throwing ideas and arguements around like crazy.
<Polarfire> And it snowballs out of control and you can't actually debate anymore. Just brainless arguement of opinions.
<Polarfire> Anyway I gotta get some sleep. I'll see you later and look forward to talking to you again somewhere... probably here. but who knows.
*Tim kills Armageddon
<TurniBrony> o/

<drf|laptop> 03http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-tell-if-your-car-is-out-of-alignment
<drf|laptop> 03#2 is me
<drf|laptop> 03and I love how they say it's a very serious problem
<drf|laptop> 03I'm trying to figure out where the heck I should go :/
<Roara|Comic> 6well yeah...
<drf|laptop> 03so where shoul dI go
<Roara|Comic> 6dunno...
<Roara|Comic> 6do you have any tire places in your area?
<Roara|Comic> 6we have a place that actually specializes in tire repair
<Roara|Comic> 6other than that, there's speedy's
<Roara|Comic> 6if you have those
<drf|laptop> 03tire places..
<drf|laptop> 03we have Bell Tire
<Roara|Comic> 6dunno what that is, but if they specialize in tires, probably try with them first
<drf|laptop> 03they sell/install tires
<Roara|Comic> 6hmm
<drf|laptop> 03http://www.belletire.com/
<Roara|Comic> 6normally if they install them, I'm fairly certain they have the ability to align
*Roara|Comic 6checks
<drf|laptop> 03"lifetime alignment checks"
<drf|laptop> 03but that's if you buy tires
<Roara|Comic> 6http://www.belletire.com/Out-the-Door-With-More.aspx#alignment
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<Roara|Comic> 6..
<Roara|Comic> 6yeh
<Roara|Comic> 6...lol
<drf|laptop> 03what
<Roara|Comic> 6well
<Roara|Comic> 6they'll still do the alignent
<Roara|Comic> 6just check to see how much they charge
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<Roara|Comic> 6http://www.belletire.com/Alignments.aspx
<Altair> night
<drf|laptop> 03I love how that site basically doesn't show prices
<Roara|Comic> 6yep
<Roara|Comic> 6lol
<drf|laptop> 03how long does it usually take?
<drf|laptop> 03http://www.speedyautotroy.com/ <- is that the place you were talking about?
<Roara|Comic> 6no
<Roara|Comic> 6forgot it's spelled weird
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<Roara|Comic> 6SpeeDee
<Roara|Comic> 6but that should work too
<drf|laptop> 03http://www.speedeeoil.com/
<drf|laptop> 03that?
<Roara|Comic> 6yeh that
<Roara|Comic> 6but the one you posted might work
<Roara|Comic> 6I'm looking at what they offer
<drf|laptop> 03well yeah, no SpeeDee stores in Michigan
<drf|laptop> 03if you look at the map
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03all I see is tire rotation
<drf|laptop> 03nothing about alighment
<drf|laptop> 03*n
<drf|laptop> 03I'll call Belle Tire first, if it's cheap enough I'll go there
<Altair> yes Link, it's me
<Altair> lol
<Altair> now i'm sleep for real
<Link> o-o
<Roara|Comic> 6they have alignment under the suspension...I dunno if they consider that the same
<Link> XD
<drf|laptop> 03I just gotta hope I can make it to class tomorrow without dying
<Roara|Comic> 6but yeh, call belle first
<Roara|Comic> 6you should be fine
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<Light_Latias> 12orlynao
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<Roara|Comic> 6usually serious problems last a while
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Roara|Comic> 6it's when they say "CHECK IMMEDIATELY" when there's a problem
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03well of course it's not going to say anything
<Roara|Comic> 6example, one of my engine belts had cracks in it, a lot of them
<drf|laptop> 03I doubt 2000 SUVs have a way to tell if the wheels aren't aligned
<Roara|Comic> 6and the people said "this is a serious problem, we need to have this done soon"
<drf|laptop> 03the only thing it shows is low fuel and low oil
<Roara|Comic> 6I told them i didn't have time, so I let it go another week
<drf|laptop> 03well, it has that panel that shows like, how many mpg you're getting, etc
<Roara|Comic> 6I don't think there are cars that tell you alignment
<drf|laptop> 03yeahj
<drf|laptop> 03-j
<drf|laptop> 03prolly not
<Roara|Comic> 6unless they're SUPER new and I don't even know about them
<Pattyrick> What kind of car do you have, Rora?
<Roara|Comic> 6that's not something the cars keep track of
<Roara|Comic> 6I've got a 91 toyota camry
<Roara|Comic> 6lovely little crapcar
<Pattyrick> ok
<Roara|Comic> 6I love it to death though
<drf|laptop> 03well I know supposedly these new ones have technology where you can like
<drf|laptop> 03not control your car ojn freeways
<drf|laptop> 03and it'll keep between the white lines
<drf|laptop> 03automatically
<Roara|Comic> 6yeah
<drf|laptop> 03sounds like a tr2ap though
<drf|laptop> 03-2
<Pattyrick> did you know that 80% of Camrys sold since 1991 are still on the road?
<Roara|Comic> 6IT'S A TRAP
<drf|laptop> 03and the other 20% had brake failure and killed their owners? :D
*drf|laptop hides
<Roara|Comic> 6yeah, camrys are insanely awsome
<Pattyrick> I like them
<drf|laptop> 03I personally do not have a problem with japanese cars
<drf|laptop> 03just that after the whole Toyota brake failure incident I'd rather not
<Pattyrick> we had one as a rental when our Highlander was being fixed, and it was nice
<drf|laptop> 03though
<Roara|Comic> 6the only issue I've ever had with mine is a notorious issue camrys in my year had
<Light_Latias> 12they're SHORT D:
<drf|laptop> 03my mom drives a Honda and that's absolutely fine
<Pattyrick> it was a 2003, I think
*Light_Latias 12shot
<Bakphoon> i'm looking to get a Ford Taurus SHO
<drf|laptop> 03LOL Ford
<Roara|Comic> 6something in the trunk framework, there's a notch where rainwater can seep in
<drf|laptop> 03that being said
<drf|laptop> 03mine's Mercury which is basically Ford
<Roara|Comic> 6most cars had it, just from how the frame was built
<Pattyrick> We used to have a 1987 Honda Civic
<drf|laptop> 03in fact it's more or less the Ford Explorer but fancier
<Roara|Comic> 6a little super glue, it's perfect
<drf|laptop> 03OL
<drf|laptop> 03*LOL
<Bakphoon> Mercury Mountaineer or whatever
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03that's what I have
<drf|laptop> 032000 model
<Bakphoon> k
<Roara|Comic> 6SUBURBANS
<Pattyrick> it would've lasted forever if we would've replaced the timing belt
<Roara|Comic> 6no more
<Bakphoon> I drive a Geo Metro most of the time
<drf|laptop> 03though I learned to drive on my mom's Honda minivan X
<drf|laptop> 03*XD
<drf|laptop> 03rofl Geo
<Roara|Comic> 6needs to be said
<drf|laptop> 03most fail brand ever
<Pattyrick> our neighbor used to have a 2000 Ford Explorer, I think
<Pattyrick> IKR?
<Roara|Comic> 6also
<drf|laptop> 03you know
<Pattyrick> Chevy, but with a different badge
<drf|laptop> 03for some reason
<Bakphoon> gets better gas mileage than any of your cars
<Roara|Comic> 6there are only two cars that make me rage
<Bakphoon> :3c
<drf|laptop> 03I really love Oldsmobile
<drf|laptop> 03the name just makes me laugh
<Roara|Comic> 6one of them I knew made me rage
<Bakphoon> I like Oldsmobile.
<Roara|Comic> 6it's just ridiculously stupid
<Roara|Comic> 6the stupid Cube
<drf|laptop> 03I love that thing
<drf|laptop> 03I actually have some pictures of it on my computer
<drf|laptop> 03for kicks
<Bakphoon> I like Buick and Oldsmobile before 1990 or so
<Pattyrick> Nissan Cube?
<Bakphoon> then again i like most cars before 1990
<drf|laptop> 03LOL OLD CARD
<drf|laptop> 03*CARS
<NightSeas> 12Ew Nissan Cube
<drf|laptop> 03I like the Oldsmobile Bravia or w/e it is
<Roara|Comic> 6but then I saw one that's just as bad imo
<Bakphoon> Better than new cars.
<Bakphoon> :3c
<drf|laptop> 03depends on what you want in a car
<Bakphoon> Bravada.
<drf|laptop> 03yeah that
<Pattyrick> Nissan Cube is meh
<Bakphoon> I'd like a Bravada.
<drf|laptop> 03Bravada was pretty nice
<drf|laptop> 03then again the Mountaineer is more or less thes ame thing
<Roara|Comic> 6http://en.suzukiclub.cz/graphics/gallery/full/424_sidekick.jpg
<Pattyrick> IDK why they had to hide the rear support pillar
<Bakphoon> except from a different company altogether
<drf|laptop> 03Haha small SUVs
<drf|laptop> 03that looks just like the Geo Tracker ror w/e it is
<drf|laptop> 03*or
<Bakphoon> it is
<Bakphoon> :V
<Pattyrick> OMG my dad used to have 2 Suzuki Sidekicks!
<drf|laptop> 03though you know what looks cool?
<drf|laptop> 03as much as i hate Kia
<drf|laptop> 03is the Kia Soul
<Pattyrick> 1991 and 1993
<drf|laptop> 03it looks pretty epic
<Roara|Comic> 6the suzuki sidekick
<Bakphoon> suzuki sidekick = geo tracker
<drf|laptop> 03that being said under the hood is like a bunch of sketchy wiring that's going to fall and die
<Pattyrick> I've heard good things about the Soul
<Roara|Comic> 6they're weird, but there's one in town that is painted a hideous magenta color
<drf|laptop> 03I haven't
<drf|laptop> 03my friend is a mechanic
<Roara|Comic> 6I want to blow it up with a grenade
<Pattyrick> some magazine said it's a good car if you want to make a nice first impression at your new school xD
<Bakphoon> the geo metro is a suzuki brand but it wasn't sold in the US as a suzuki
<drf|laptop> 03and he said there's one wire under the hood that if you accidentally bump, your car starts leaking gas all over
<drf|laptop> 03but it looks cool
<drf|laptop> 03but eh
<drf|laptop> 03I really do like the way the 2000 model Mountaineers/Ford Explorers look
<Roara|Comic> 6kia soul looks like a basscar
<Pattyrick> basscar?
<Roara|Comic> 6there's enough of those as it is
<drf|laptop> 03the only other SUVs that I love are like the GMC Jimmy and Chevy Blazer, which are more or less salso the same thing
<drf|laptop> 03*also
<NightSeas> 12I like the MB GLK class
<drf|laptop> 03MB?
<Roara|Comic> 6basscar = stereotypical gang car with mega stereo systems and yep
<Pattyrick> I love our 03 Toyota Highlander
<Pattyrick> Agreed with NS
<Pattyrick> or Gl
<Roara|Comic> 6the ones that can blow your eardrums out
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<NightSeas> 12MB= Mercedes-Benz
<drf|laptop> 03dude
<drf|laptop> 03my SUV has tons of bass
<drf|laptop> 03the entire back half
<drf|laptop> 03is subwoofers
<drf|laptop> 03it's amazing
<Pattyrick> but they're expensive =
<Pattyrick> *=\
<Pattyrick> Mercedes Benz
<drf|laptop> 03you play Eiffel 65 on there
<drf|laptop> 03and you can't even hear the words
<drf|laptop> 03and this is with the bass at 50%
<drf|laptop> 03put it at 100%, ears = shot
<Roara|Comic> 6lol
<drf|laptop> 03but I love it for that reason
<drf|laptop> 03:D
<NightSeas> 12I just hate spelling Mercedes-Benz xD
<drf|laptop> 03and yeah, Mercedes is like stupidly overprice
<drf|laptop> 03d
<drf|laptop> 03they haven't had the Benz in their name in... 10 years maybe?
<drf|laptop> 03it's just Merceds
<drf|laptop> 03*es
<drf|laptop> 03did you know
<Bakphoon> uh
<Bakphoon> no
<drf|laptop> 03that the new Jeep Grand Cherokee is actually made by Mercedes?
<NightSeas> 12Nope, did not know
<Bakphoon> it's still Mercedes-Benz
<Pattyrick> People just say Mercedes because it's easier
<drf|laptop> 03it's still *formally* called that, but all the dealerships just say Mercedes
<Roara|Comic> 6not that I'm much for flashy cars, I really like the Saleen S7
<Pattyrick> proper people call it Mercedes Benz
<Roara|Comic> 6</random>
<drf|laptop> 03Saleen? What brand is that
<drf|laptop> 03?
<drf|laptop> 03also hm
<drf|laptop> 03you know wha tI want to find
*Pattyrick runs
<Roara|Comic> 6its own
<drf|laptop> 03something that replaces the cigarette lighter (as EW SMOKING) but protects the poewr outlet
<Pattyrick> yay, TST is up! =D
<drf|laptop> 03but yet
<Roara|Comic> 6http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saleen_S7
<drf|laptop> 03it's next to impossible to find
<drf|laptop> 03not sure why
<Bakphoon> the truck we used to have
<Bakphoon> had both a lighter and a 12V DC outlet
<drf|laptop> 03that's pretty nice
<drf|laptop> 03well yeah
<drf|laptop> 03mine has two outlets
<drf|laptop> 03one is by the radio
<drf|laptop> 03and has the lighter
<drf|laptop> 03the other just has a cap over it
<Bakphoon> yeah same
<drf|laptop> 03I'd like to ditch the lighter though
<NightSeas> 12Well, the Mercedes GLK class is around $35,000 new, somewhat cheap compared to their other models
<drf|laptop> 03as a few times I've bumped it and had it heat up :|
<Bakphoon> we sold that truck recently though
<Bakphoon> lrn2not punch things
<drf|laptop> 03I said bump
<drf|laptop> 03not punch
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah
<Bakphoon> bumping
<Bakphoon> punching
<drf|laptop> 03I just don't know why it's so hard to get a piece of plastic that fits in there
<Bakphoon> what's the difference
<drf|laptop> 03but yet, go google it, I can't find one
<drf|laptop> 03:/
<Pattyrick> Mmmmmm Saleen S7
*drf|laptop waits on the key-fob to arrive
<drf|laptop> 03as mine completely broke
<drf|laptop> 03and I hate having to turn the key
<drf|laptop> 03that's so ghetto
<Pattyrick> Somebody knows a good American supercar =D
<drf|laptop> 03good american supercar
<Roara|Comic> 6lol
<drf|laptop> 03Dodge Viper
<drf|laptop> 03I love those
<Bakphoon> I'd love to get an AMC car
<drf|laptop> 03I'm honestly surprised that you guys know so much about cars
<drf|laptop> 03I used to not know much but my former roommate was a mechanic so he taught me
<NightSeas> 12As for cheap SUVs, I really like the Jeep Patriot
<Roara|Comic> 6I grew up with a dad who adores mustangs
<Pattyrick> key fobs are interesting
<drf|laptop> 03EW
<Roara|Comic> 6naturally, I'm the same
<drf|laptop> 03My friend told me the Mustang sucks
<Roara|Comic> 6but I grew into other cars too
<drf|laptop> 03like as far as how it's built
<Roara|Comic> 6LOLNO
<Roara|Comic> 6well
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03he said
<Roara|Comic> 6preferences
<Pattyrick> Mustang is good, but I'd say it's a little overrated
<drf|laptop> 03the rear axel is in a fashion that
<drf|laptop> 03will wear itself down over time
<Pattyrick> old
<Pattyrick> it's got the classic live-axel
<Bakphoon> I'd love to get an old Firebird.
<Roara|Comic> 6I would love to have a 69 shelby mustang
<drf|laptop> 03yeah, which is totally not safe
<Roara|Comic> 6same with my dad though lol
<drf|laptop> 03as for jeeps, I kinda want to test trive the new Jeep Grand Cherokee, I've heard that thing was epic
<Bakphoon> axle
<drf|laptop> 03I kinda like SUVs, even though they suck for gas mileage
<Pattyrick> I'd like to have an Ariel Atom
<drf|laptop> 03just because I like high-off-the-ground vehicles
<Pattyrick> that thing it totally insane

<drf|laptop> 03they are unless you have snow
<drf|laptop> 032 wheel drive
<Bakphoon> it's a mid-size so it's not too small
<drf|laptop> 03it sucks
<Roara|Comic> 6...true
<drf|laptop> 03I got the van stuck in snow like 5 times
<Pattyrick> My mom has wanted a Pacifica for a while

<drf|laptop> 03was like
<Bakphoon> I liked driving our truck because it was extended cab
<drf|laptop> 03hmm, I could go back on the 50mph main road and go in the next entrance, or just drive over the curb
<drf|laptop> 03guess what I did
<drf|laptop> 03you can't do that in a minivan
<Bakphoon> it had "seats" but I just used the back as storage

<Pattyrick> I like the styling of the new Toyota Siena
<Pattyrick> we saw one in Seattle (with a California plate, Rora) that was really awesome
<Pattyrick> black rims and dark teal paint
<drf|laptop> 03replacement key fob for my SUV
<drf|laptop> 03since I'm getting annoyed at using the key to open the door XD
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I use the keyless entry numpad
<drf|laptop> 03but still
<drf|laptop> 03that involves effort
<drf|laptop> 03anyway
<drf|laptop> 03I need to wake up in less than 7 hours
<drf|laptop> 03I should really have been asleep about 2 hours ago
<Bakphoon> :V
<Pattyrick> our Highlander's fob is still in the little plastic bag that it came to Italy in xD
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 0311 year old vehicle
<drf|laptop> 03that was used almost every day
<drf|laptop> 03obviously it's gonna wear down
<Bakphoon> I have never had a car with a key fob and i'd probably still use the key if i ever did get one
<drf|laptop> 03physically it still works, but the plastic broke off so there's no way to attach it to they keychain
<drf|laptop> 03and I got a new one for like 20 bucks
<drf|laptop> 03so I'm like OK
<drf|laptop> 03dude I hate using hte key, I'd refuse to get a car without keyless entry XD
<Bakphoon> stick key in hole, turn, this sounds familiar
<drf|laptop> 03until you get rust in there
<drf|laptop> 03like in the SUV
<Bakphoon> how
<drf|laptop> 03half the time it won't open
<drf|laptop> 03good question
<Bakphoon> do you even manage that
<drf|laptop> 03it just does
<Bakphoon> :V
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03if you go 11 years without using the key unlock once
<drf|laptop> 03what do you think happens
<drf|laptop> 03it's going to rust
<drf|laptop> 03so I go to try it and it's like, no this won't turn

<Link> i think it ignores all XD /idk
<Drake> 04Probably
<Drake> 04Because no one has spoken in #SW for 4 days, and I think NS is responsible.
<Light_Latias> o.o
<Armageddon> LOL Drake
<Armageddon> /ignore *!*@* ignores everyone and everything
<Drake> 04Now how do I remove something from my ignore list

<Drake> 04THAT WAS YOUR FAULT NS
<Ascendant> Apparently
<Ascendant> he took /ignore *!*@* seriously
<Ascendant> and actually did it on here
<Ascendant> so he couldn't see anyone talk
*Ascendant lols
<Kyu> 07o3o

<Aurora> 6LOL
<Aurora> 6so what, you thought the place was dead that long?
<Drake> 04NS (jokingly) told me to do it
<Pattyrick> they have an ignore command?
<Drake> 04Yes
<Drake> 04For 4 days
*Ascendant laughs at Drake
<Ascendant> although
<Pattyrick> wow

<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04Well it didn't
<Aurora> 6You had it on THAT LONG

<Pattyrick> Noob at IRC? You must've been 4
<Ascendant> rofl
<Pattyrick> nah, I won't try to fail
<Ascendant> I was 13
<Pattyrick> oh
<Ascendant> it basically parts you from every channel on the network
<Pattyrick> so you've only been boss at IRC for a year
<Ascendant> it's the equivalent of /partall
<Ascendant> basically
<Ascendant> after Altair put up his server
<Ascendant> and I began crashing services
<Ascendant> crash and burn, baby!
<Pattyrick> I've been a roller coaster boss for 3 years >:D
<Drake> 04'part' is codeword for 'leave' amirite/
<Drake> 04?*
<Pattyrick> That's how I interpreted it
<Ascendant> yes

<Ascendant> wat
<Ascendant> Drake
<Ascendant> I'm not omnicidal ):
<Ascendant> I don't want to destroy everything, just some things
<Ascendant> like your innocence

<Ascendant> because you think I'm a monster
<Ascendant> ):

<Ascendant> <%Espeon> what makes a good demoman video game is a good topic indeed
<Ascendant> I copypasta'd it from my old topic lol
<Arti|> 12I told them to check last year's invoice, they said "We checked it and you paid £240" and I was like WTF
<Arti|> 12I told them to check it again because I KNOW I paid £120

<NightSeas> 12Hello Articuno

<Arti|> 12and so I paid, but I just can't believe they tried to overcharge me
<Arti|> 12£120 isn't too bad for what I get
<Ascendant> you're running TST on a VPS amirite?
<Ascendant> Because shared hosting seriously just DOESN'T get up to £120
<Arti|> 12No
<Arti|> 12It's shared
*Ascendant confusedface

<Ascendant> There's lot of good shared hosting out there
<Ascendant> that doesn't cost that much D:
<Arti|> 12In the UK?
<Arti|> 12I know I can trust this host to run my site's databases properly
<Arti|> 12I've been to countless others that don't, it's really hard to find shared hosting that can run databases smoothly
<Arti|> 12The only problem is this host's support >v>
<Ascendant> oh god support
<Ascendant> I HATE hosting support
<Ascendant> usually it's a piece of crap and it takes several days for them to get back to you
<Ascendant> and live support is NEVER online
<Arti|> 12lol, this lot get back to you but they never get it right XD
<Arti|> 12and we end up arguing for days
<Ascendant> rofl
<Ascendant> one of my friends
<Ascendant> had to provide their credentials again
<Ascendant> because the hosting company accused them of fraud

<Pattyrick> some of the certain requirements to receive communion
<Pattyrick> apparently, you have to be married in the church to get it, and my dad isn't baptized
<Pattyrick> so even if he was baptized, he couldn't get it

<Espeon> 06I have no problems with religion as long as it doesn't go overboard. If people find safety and something to believe in that's totally cool, but if it becomes more of a hindrance in life than those things then the alarm starts ringing at least in my head :P

<Polarfire> and in the end he showed me one of his favs and I made him read mine.
<Polarfire> I picked a really good one for mine
<Polarfire> and when he got to the end he said: The ones that are good need to spend their time writing a book or something"
<Polarfire> *headdesk*
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Polarfire> It was so funny, I tries and tried to show him it could be good, and in the end when he knew he really like it... he tries to argue again.

<prince-dari> Must be a glitch.
<Polarfire> It says ban under your name..... Does this mean I have mod powers? XD

<Aurora> my next plush
<Aurora> espeon
<Angel_Espeon> 13:D
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also, I did that TohoSort thing last night: http://i160.photobucket.com/albums/t190/xxHarmonyAngelxx/favtouhouchars.jpg
<Angel_Espeon> 13I somehow have 5 characters tied for 1st place
<Aurora> 6don't worry, I had 4
<Aurora> 6but yes
<Aurora> 6espeon plush
<Aurora> 6life size
<Aurora> 6GLORIOUS
<lightumbreon> 06i read things about touhou
<lightumbreon> 06i tried to download the games
<lightumbreon> 06and saw some videos
<Angel_Espeon> 13and somehow Great Catfish isn't right at the bottom of the list when I don't even know anything about that character >>;
<lightumbreon> 06but oh god
<Aurora> 6yeah I hate that they added the dolls and the fish and everything
<lightumbreon> 06i'm checking under my bed tonight for Flandre Scarlet
*lightumbreon hides behind AE
<Aurora> 6lol why are people scared of her
<Angel_Espeon> 13Is it just me, or does every single new Touhou player get to know Flandre first? xD
<lightumbreon> 06i saw ONE video
<lightumbreon> 06that creeped me out a bit
<lightumbreon> 06yesh
<lightumbreon> 06i didn't play it
<lightumbreon> 06YET
<Aurora> 6angel, I can say I learned about her first, but NOT BECAUSE OF HER SONG 8D
<lightumbreon> 06downloading the first 12 now...
<lightumbreon> 06and yes
<lightumbreon> 06the song
<lightumbreon> 06xD
<Aurora> 6that's how 99% of people find out
<lightumbreon> 06mmhmm
<Aurora> 6I actually found out about it through bad apple
<lightumbreon> 06but i like Mojou's theme for some reason
<Aurora> 6*mokou
<Aurora> 6granted, I did see the mcroll video 2 years prior to seeing bad apple
<Angel_Espeon> 13I first found Touhou when I saw a video on youtube ages ago showing scans from one of the doujins
<Aurora> 6but didn't think anything of it
<Angel_Espeon> 13and the first characters I ever saw were Ran and Chen
<drf-Droid> faaaaaling asleep
<drf-Droid> so aurora I called belle tire
<Angel_Espeon> 13But Flandre was the first character I learned the name of :B
<drf-Droid> they said it costs $65 at the most
<lightumbreon> 06same here
<Bakphoon> I first found touhou when i didn't
<drf-Droid> I figure that's cheap for car repair
<lightumbreon> 06bad apple, by Xi was kinda epic
<drf-Droid> so I made a 4pm appt
<Aurora> 6sounds about right drf
<drf-Droid> Bad Apple is redundant
<SilverSonic> <lightumbreon> bad apple, by Xi <-- I had that in my Opposite Day Special XD
*drf-Droid hides
<lightumbreon> 06xD
<Aurora> 6and them saying at most, I don't think it'll actually be that expensive
<prince-dari> $65? That's nothing. O__o
<drf-Droid> yeah
<lightumbreon> 06so if touhou is allowed on RN...hehehehe
<drf-Droid> they said it takes like 45 mins
<lightumbreon> 06i know just the right song :P
<drf-Droid> and apparently that's for both the back and front wheels
<drf-Droid> lu, piano version of UN Owen or gefo
<drf-Droid> *gtfo
<Aurora> 6....OH LOL I forgot I actually finished my coic last night
<lightumbreon> 06also
<SilverSonic> :p
<lightumbreon> 06its nice
<lightumbreon> 06but the piano version of Mokou is slightly better
<drf-Droid> no way
<Angel_Espeon> 13I like UN Owen Was Her, but imo it's a bit overrated |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13I mean
<Aurora> 6mokou's theme is amazing
<lightumbreon> 06^
<Angel_Espeon> 13I like it, but it's not one of my favourites
<Aurora> 6and +1 to angel there
<drf-Droid> well I don't give a crap about touhou, I only like that song, and only the piano version
<drf-Droid> zzzz
<Aurora> 6what what I about to do...lol
<Aurora> 6oh yeah
<drf-Droid> I wonder if the people at belle tire would mind if I fell asleep
<drf-Droid> while waiting
<drf-Droid> LOL

<drf-Droid> you still love it?
<Aurora> 6yes
<Aurora> 6just because you don't doesn't mean I cant
<Espeon> 06For once I'm actually glad I scrolled up, because relevant plush.
<Aurora> 6lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13Still annoyed that someone who uploaded loads of amazing Touhou arranges closed their account on Youtube :|
<Angel_Espeon> 13Thankfully I donwloaded most of them
<Angel_Espeon> 13but my playlist is all messed up now ;;
*Aurora 6has mr kakashi's entire playlist
<Aurora> 6ENTIRE
<Aurora> 6tat's.....a lot of songs xD
<drf-Droid> why would you ever go to youtube just to listen to music
<drf-Droid> learn to download mp3s
<Aurora> 6I don't
<drf-Droid> that was @ AE
<Angel_Espeon> 13So I can listen to them while I'm at college
<Aurora> 6if the mp3 is there, I get that
<Aurora> 6oh
<drf-Droid> you can listen to mp3s at school
<lightumbreon> 06youtube downloaders FTW
<Aurora> 6my touhou music files
<Aurora> 6take up 5 GB on my computer
<lightumbreon> 06with 1080P function :P
<drf-Droid> ...
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't put the Touhou songs on my mp3 because it'd take up too much space :B
<drf-Droid> video downloaders are for *VIDEOS*
<drf-Droid> not music
<lightumbreon> 06i convert them
<Aurora> 6I've been saying 5gb just because it was close enough
<lightumbreon> 06to MP3
<drf-Droid> if they don't have a download link
<Aurora> 6I didn't realize it actually PASSED 5
<lightumbreon> 06yes
<drf-Droid> I yell at the uploader
<drf-Droid> until they give me one
<SilverSonic> drf: I use my YTdownloaderHD for music
<SilverSonic> ::P
<SilverSonic> :P*
<drf-Droid> you must not care about quality
<SilverSonic> i only do it for Sound effects and voice clips :P
<SilverSonic> you know for bloopers ;P
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6you just said you do it for music lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol sound quality
<Aurora> 6anyways though
<drf-Droid> either way, I use DownloadHelper if I want, you know, actual videos
<SilverSonic> XD
<drf-Droid> if I want music, I either use filestube
<drf-Droid> or PM the uploader
<SilverSonic> Music being like Trolol or the fun house theme
<drf-Droid> which usually works
*SilverSonic mauled
<Aurora> 6comic is done, I can spend my time on other stuff yay
<drf-Droid> the trololol thing is an actual song
<Angel_Espeon> 13That comic was awesome :P
<drf-Droid> as in it's on iTunes and whatnot
<Aurora> 6the BFOI one?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yep :3
<Aurora> 6yeah I was like forget it, I'm finishing this
<SilverSonic> yes drf, but i cbf'd downloading it from there:P
<Aurora> 6stayed up til 2
<SilverSonic> :P *
<drf-Droid> then go try www.filestube.com
<Aurora> 6and I almost woke up at 7 with no problem about being tired LOL
<SilverSonic> I have my own dowloader kthx
<drf-Droid> it's not a downloader.
<drf-Droid> it searches for mp3s and such
<SilverSonic> well, i dont feel like using it atm :P
*Ray yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawns
<lightumbreon> 06RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
<lightumbreon> 06hi
<Angel_Espeon> 13asdfgh
*Angel_Espeon yaaaawns
<Ray> 02Hiya Light, Angel
<Espeon> 06I just use an online video to mp3 download thing, and I find the quality just fine.
*Espeon also yawns
<Angel_Espeon> 13^
<Aurora> 6^
<Aurora> 6unless the quality of the video is bad enough
<Aurora> 6but I tend to look for mp3s first
<drf-Droid> the music you download must not have a lot of bass then, as yt DESTROYS bass and highs
<drf-Droid> and wtf
<Espeon> 06That it does
<Espeon> 06But I still don't mind it
<Espeon> 06xD
<UxieLover> 11Hello
<drf-Droid> I rested my head for a bit and now my eye won't focus o.o
<Angel_Espeon> 13So long as the music isn't crackly/fuzzy etc, then I'm happy :B
<Aurora> 6I hate that
<Polarfire> aww ma I lost my house :(
<Polarfire> u still there dari?
<Icydragon> Hiii
<Espeon> 06o.o
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Aurora> 6@drf lol
<Polarfire> so since you are the coding guru, what all do you do?
<Aurora> 6not being able to focus my eyes
<Aurora> 6sucks
<drf-Droid> yeah
<drf-Droid> it's only one of them
<lightumbreon> 06i wish my nose would focus
<prince-dari> What all do I do? O_o
<lightumbreon> 06it's impossible to have a cold IN SUMMER
<lightumbreon> 06but i sneeze ALOT
<drf-Droid> so do I
<lightumbreon> 06maybe the dust from work....
<Espeon> 06your nose could focus what
<drf-Droid> or sunlight?
<lightumbreon> 06a cold from sunlight?
<lightumbreon> 06hm...
<drf-Droid> not a cold
<drf-Droid> sneezes
<Polarfire> yeah. what's coding?
<lightumbreon> 06yes
<lightumbreon> 06possible as heck
<drf-Droid> I know
<drf-Droid> that's why I said it
<lightumbreon> 06i need a proper dust mask for work x.x
<lightumbreon> 06when clearing things out, and braking stuff, dust masks are helpfull
<Polarfire> is pretty much what im asking
<drf-Droid> just set the place on fire
<Aurora> 6sensitive to sunlight, photosensitive
<lightumbreon> 06..
<drf-Droid> you know you want to
<Aurora> 6I actually have it
<Aurora> 6I can't drive without sunglasses
<lightumbreon> 06and die from burning isolation?
<Aurora> 6and it sucks that you start sneezing if it's too bright xD
<lightumbreon> 06^
<drf-Droid> isolation what
<lightumbreon> 06in my case, dust, alot of DUST
<drf-Droid> you leave the building once you set the fire
<lightumbreon> 06and SS, guess what i worked with today?
<lightumbreon> 06DRILL!
*lightumbreon runs
<prince-dari> Basically.
<drf-Droid> did you drill that thing all night long?
*drf-Droid hides
<lightumbreon> 06no
<lightumbreon> 06a few holes, to fit sockets in
<drf-Droid> ;o
<lightumbreon> 06and broke down a wall, so some isolation could be refitted
<prince-dari> It's when you write anything in programming languages. It's pretty broad. It could be anything from making a game to making then server for an online banking system.
<prince-dari> the*
<SilverSonic> ;o
<prince-dari> Pretty much it's just using technical knowledge to make use of the power computers have./
<Polarfire> That's pretty cool.
<Polarfire> I wish I haid said knowlege.
<Polarfire> *had
<Silverscreen> RAwr
<Polarfire> Silverscreen!
<prince-dari> Lol, the internet is the ultimate source of knowledge. :P
<prince-dari> Especially of this kind.
<Polarfire> it's a party!
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> O__o
<prince-dari> I didn't even get to say hello.
<prince-dari> Hey Silverscreen.
<Polarfire> Silverscreen what is coding?
<UxieLover> 11Hey
<Polarfire> even though dari told me already
<prince-dari> Meh, that's just my definition anyway.
<Polarfire> I like it
<Polarfire> your definition, I'm just trying to learn.
<Sneas> 03o.o
<drf-Droid> zzzzzz
<prince-dari> Everything I know in this area is self-taught by experimenting and using the internet for reference.
<SilverSonic> SNEAS
<Icydragon> Yo
*SilverSonic gloms
<SilverSonic> +p
<Silverscreen> Coding is where you use a series of commands to get a program to do as you want.
<prince-dari> Though I'll be doing some form of computing in university for sure.
<SilverSonic> ZzZzZzZ
<Skylands> 10o.o
<prince-dari> >Kamina@WHO.THE.FUCK.DO.YOU.THINK.I.AM)
<prince-dari> >implying I think
<UxieLover> 11How are you?
<Icydragon> Fiiiiiiiine
<prince-dari> My friend hates smoking (just tobacco).
<prince-dari> I find out that recently he's started smoking.
<prince-dari> The hell?
<Icydragon> Makes perfect sense to me
<Icydragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM9IQ95iJlk&feature=related
<prince-dari> Makes no sense to me.
<Icydragon> Well your not high so quit whining
<prince-dari> He smoked weed, but he always hated tobacco, so why would he just start smoking it?
<Icydragon> Who knows really
<prince-dari> Well next time I see him, I'll abuse him for it.
<Icydragon> Well that's not the brony way
<UxieLover> 11?
<prince-dari> Yeah, but everyone knows that it's flawed in that sense.
<prince-dari> If you tolerate bad things, you are helping to allow these bad things happen.
<prince-dari> Tolerance should only go so far.
<Icydragon> Whatever you think you need to do
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Lightning> gah i cant figure out this cleartype shit
<Ray> 02Just by seeing that got me into the mood of playing

<Hooh54> 05o.o
<Angel_Espeon> 13Which game were you playing?
<Ray||Touhou> 02PCB
<Roarafk> 6LOL
<Ghosties> 4Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Spore, Terraria, Audiosurf, Killing Floor
<Roarafk> 6sounds right
<Ghosties> 4You may now start
<Ray||Touhou> 02Normal diff.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Youmu
<Angel_Espeon> 13YOUMU
<Angel_Espeon> 13;;
<Roarafk> 6 4th stage is a rainstorm of bullets
<SirSprinkles> 6KOTOR
<Roarafk> 6 5th stage isn't so bad, but yeah youmu comes in and there goes EVERYTHING
<Angel_Espeon> 134th stage is my favourite one in that game xD
<Polarfire> 0I like spore... and audiosurf is cool.
<SirSprinkles> 6Or Killing Floor... it's a tie.
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<Umbreon> 12noooo
<prince-dari> MFW I've never played any of these games and have no opinion.
<Ray||Touhou> 02and the final ._.
<Hooh54> 05O.O
<Polarfire> 0I've never played killing floor
<Ray||Touhou> 02Urgh
<Hooh54> 05*umbreon eyes*
<Polarfire> 0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
<Ghosties> 4So, it's a tie between KOTOR, Spore, and Killing Floor
<Ghosties> 4We need a tie breaker
<Roarafk> 6...
*Roarafk 6curls up in a corner and cries
<Roarafk> 6I WAS SO CLOSE
<Ray||Touhou> 02yuyuko's last 2 spellcards
<Polarfire> 0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
<Ray||Touhou> 02those 2 make everyone cry
<Polarfire> 0I'm just going to throw that out there...
<Ghosties> 4That's not a tie breaker
<Umbreon> 1,14o8°4o
<Roarafk> 6no
<Roarafk> 6see
<Polarfire> 0aww...
<Roarafk> 6I got to her last spellcard
<Roarafk> 6I forgot there was that last one
<Hooh54> 05It looks like glowing shiny Umbreon rings XD
<Ghosties> 4I'll just choose mahself
<Roarafk> 6where you basically beat her but she comes baclk
<Roarafk> 6the 30% one
<Polarfire> 0ok
<Ray||Touhou> 02LOLOLOL, the last one
<Umbreon> 12lol
<prince-dari> Ghosties is now Trollestia.
<Roarafk> 6I thought i beat her
<Roarafk> 6the first time I ever fought her myself
<Ghosties> How you figure?
<Ray||Touhou> 02that is not that hard, but I always go there without bombs so.. |D
<Roarafk> 6and then she came back
<Hipster_Brony> 8i swear to god, we need an auto ban for that pic
<Roarafk> 6I didn't have a single bomb or extra life
<prince-dari> "Gotcha"
<Ghosties> 4BUT IT'S BJORNFOT
<Roarafk> 6died RIGHT as I was aboutt o finish it
<SirSprinkles> 6That pic is evil.
<Polarfire> 0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
<Silverscreen> Never played Killing Floor, Spore's only good for it's customizable creatures, so it's KORTOR
*Ray||Touhou hugs
<Ghosties> Haha, yeah
<Roarafk> 6I pretty much raged
<Roarafk> 6all night
<Silverscreen> KOTOR*
<Ray||Touhou> 02I know that feel
<Ghosties> I think that everytime I type it
<Hipster_Brony> 8ghosties: and nothing of value was lost XD
<Ghosties> *every time
<Roarafk> 6I'd never even gotten past youmu
<Angel_Espeon> 13I had 6 lives by the time I was going up against Yuyuko
<Ghosties> 4KORTOR
<Angel_Espeon> 13somehow
<Angel_Espeon> 13Just looked at my replay now
<Roarafk> 6..
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Silverscreen> KORTOR!
<Roarafk> 6yeah I managed to get to yuyuko with 4 of my lives
<Ghosties> 4KNIGHTS OF REALLY THE OLD REPUBLIC
<prince-dari> ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY GYRO INTO KORTOR!
<Roarafk> 6SOMEHOW
<Roarafk> 6and yeah
<Silverscreen> The glue maker's assistant!
<Roarafk> 6I did some stupid stuff
<Ghosties> 4Scootaglue
<Roarafk> 6but considering that was my first time fighting her
<Roarafk> 6I think I did alright :>
<Angel_Espeon> 13I hate having such a good run, and then dying to stupidity at the end D:
<Sneas> 03:3
<Ray||Touhou> 02also, Sakuya CAN'T DeathBomb
<Roarafk> 6lol
<Ray||Touhou> 02It's just Impossible to me ._.
<Silverscreen> I use scootaglue in my art classes.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Next game I want to 1CC on normal mode is SA, but I'm thinking of going for UFO first since I find that one a bit easier
*Ray||Touhou tries again, with reimu
<Polarfire> 0well...
<Polarfire> 0when chat is slow.
<Polarfire> 0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
<Hooh54> 05ESPEON FACE
<Polarfire> 0I rest my case.
<prince-dari> What is it with that picture? O__o
<Ghosties> 4Oh, there was an odd thread last night
<Ghosties> 4on Ponychan, on /oat/
<Hooh54> 13:3
<Ghosties> 4"Cutting Up the Ghosties" was the title
<Ghosties> 4Needless to say I took offense
<Polarfire> 0 0_o
<Polarfire> 0mfw
<Roarafk> 6ufo is enragingly hard for me
<Umbreon> 12espeon face
<Angel_Espeon> 13also on CtC I noticed that once you've 1cc'd it once, it's a lot easier to do it again on the other paths you can take
<Umbreon> 12that technology hasn't been made yet
<Angel_Espeon> 13since only the first 3 stages are different |D
<Roarafk> 6yeah but the bullet styles are different
<Roarafk> 6based on which path you take
<Silverscreen> :D
<Ghosties> 4Then he made another topic and called it "Slicing Up the Ghosties." That one was taken off /oat/
<Polarfire> 0lol
<Roarafk> 6path for is curtain style, WAY more bullets than say, 1st stage
<Angel_Espeon> 13The only bullet pattern I've noticed to be different is Youmu
<Angel_Espeon> 13all the others seem exactly the same to me o-o
<Ghosties> 4This emoticon :D should really be XD
<Roarafk> 6well, I'm talking more for the first 3 stages
<Roarafk> 6they have different spell patterns
<Hooh54> 05Scientists need to create Espeons and Umbreons
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ah yeah
<Hipster_Brony> 8best kick ever
<Angel_Espeon> 13not that difficult though
<Silverscreen> HA.
<Roarafk> 6no it's not
<Roarafk> 6but if you're used to one style and switch to another
<Polarfire> 0I gotta say that was good.
<Roarafk> 6it's hard
<Polarfire> 0You guys should save it.
<Polarfire> 0Can mods kick mods?
<Roarafk> 6since marisa is adapted to ANY fighting style in this game, not just her standard fast speed and high attack
<prince-dari> Dunno.
<Angel_Espeon> 13But Alice is such a pain for me to beat >> and path D is the only one I need to 1cc now
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes, but we dont except in certain circumstances
<prince-dari> I think ops can kick ops.
<Hipster_Brony> 8also
<Polarfire> 0only one way to find out...
<Roarafk> 6she takes on reimu's standard slower + more rang for...path 3 I think?
<prince-dari> Unless protected mode is on.
<Polarfire> 0LAST MOD STANDING WINS
<Roarafk> 6on normal? o.o
<Roarafk> 6you've beaten normal already?
<Ghosties> 4Fucking Sprinks and his admin status
<SirSprinkles> 6I would be last standing. XD
*prince-dari uses scripts to kick the whole channel.
<Hipster_Brony> 8certain spiderman pics are apparently autobanned on ponychan now
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yeah, on all the paths apart from D |D
<prince-dari> Other than Sprinkles.
<Roarafk> 6...
*Roarafk 6cries in a corner again
<Silverscreen> ha.
<Roarafk> 6brb anyways, shower
<Angel_Espeon> 13because once I get past the first 3 stages, the last 3 are really easy for me now LOL
<Polarfire> 0this is awesome
<prince-dari> Although we can still ban Sprinkles, just not kick him.
<prince-dari> But if he leaves, then he won't know how to get back in. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6But I can just unban. I have multiple IPs, remember?
<SirSprinkles> 6I use several wifis.
<prince-dari> I could ban them all. (: Do you know how to unban from outside the channel?
<Espeon> 06>genetical engineering
<Ghosties> 4Kicking me when I was looking at something, you sly dog
<Espeon> 06We can wish
<prince-dari> I have a random kick function.

<SirSprinkles> 6I do.
<prince-dari> Meh.

<SirSprinkles> 6Dari... what ARE you doing?
<prince-dari> Trololo
<Silverscreen> I heard of channels in a chat server going down because of jackasses who know script invading them. :/
<SirSprinkles> 6Silly polar can't talk now.
<prince-dari> No more egg image for you Polarfire.
<Silverscreen> ha.
<Hipster_Brony> 8u currently experiencing the emotion of anger, bro?
<prince-dari> The worst thing that could happen is you get attacked by a botnet probably.
<prince-dari> Especially if security is sub par.
<Ghosties> 4How likely is that to happen to us?
<Hooh54> 05!umbreon
*Umbreon still belongs to Espeon for 11 more minutes
<Polarfire> 0thankyou
<Hipster_Brony> 8not likely, considering we have dari
<Hooh54> 05Lol
<Umbreon> [!umbreon vars reset]
<Silverscreen> That depends on wheter or not we get on anypony's bad side.
<prince-dari> On a big server like this we are less likely to be specifically targeted (though at times our channel is the biggest on the network, so that make us more likely to get attacked).
<prince-dari> Usually botnets attack the server, rather than specific channels (though they do do that too).
<prince-dari> You don't have to do anything to get on people's bad side. :P
<prince-dari> Sometimes botnets just turn up randomly.
<SilverSonic> !umbreon
*Umbreon now belongs to SilverSonic for 15 minutes
*Polarfire 0is wondering what a botnet is
<SilverSonic> !umbreon
<prince-dari> If we have our own server we're more likely to get attacked by anonymous type people.
*Umbreon still belongs to SilverSonic for 15 more minutes
<SilverSonic> XD
<Ghosties> That's something I didn't consider
<Polarfire> 0Onward! to google!
<Ghosties> The possibility of being attacked once we get into full swing once Season 2 starts
*Polarfire 0has returned with knowlege
<Hooh54> 05!espeon
*Espeon still belongs to Angel_Espeon for 13 more minutes
<prince-dari> Anything we're likely to get attacked by we should be able to handle.
<SirSprinkles> This is why you keep backups of things. Incase you're attacked so it can be easily fixed.
<Ghosties> Do we have backups?
<prince-dari> Backups of what? O_o
<Silverscreen> google is such a wonderful thing.
<Ghosties> I dunno
<Polarfire> 0that's how I found the eggface
<Ghosties> Whatever it is Sprinks was talking about
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Silverscreen> ha
<Ghosties> 4Lord, we've become tyrants
<SirSprinkles> We don't have any sort of backups for anything related to the chat, currently, obviously.
<SirSprinkles> Except the ban list. I have that recorded.
<Polarfire> 0http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_li7p39TkII1qafrh6.jpg
<Polarfire> 0ht tp://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_li7p39TkII1qafrh6.jpg
<prince-dari> If that is the gg things again...
<prince-dari> eegg*g
<Polarfire> 0nope!
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> egg*
<Polarfire> 0lol
<Ghosties> Still, I think it'd be in our best interests to consider the very possibility that we will be attacked by someone once Season 2 starts.
<prince-dari> Can't see what I'm typing, crappy computer.
<Silverscreen> ha.
<SirSprinkles> Well, considering we'd be on our own server or whatever, it would be easy to fix.
*Ray||Touhou ragequits
*Ray||Touhou rages rages rages
<prince-dari> Actually, own server makes it harder to fix.
<SirSprinkles> ...lawl
<Ghosties> Considering just how big our thing may become once Season 2 begins, we're likely to become a major player in the Brony community; that is, if we're the only "official" Brony stream for Season 2 eps
<prince-dari> Because it'd be easier to DDoS the server.
<Polarfire> 0http://nakedrabbit.com/x/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/008_egg_face.jpg
<Angel_Espeon> 13D:
<prince-dari> Unless we want to fork out money.
<prince-dari> :P
<SirSprinkles> >implying we're not somewhat big in the community as is
<Ray> 02I had like 6 lives with reimu
<Ghosties> We are a nice part of the community, and recognized
<Polarfire> 0me and 7 mods is fun
<Ray> 02> 4th Stage
<SirSprinkles> We're not MAJOR, but we're recognizable by most ponies.
<Ghosties> But if we can clamp the market as "official" brony stream
<Ghosties> We'll definitely be huge
<Ray> 02I got of it with 1 live and 0 bombs
<Ray> 02> ragequited
<SirSprinkles> Oh, yeah.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Which bullet type were you using?
<Ghosties> How well do you think we can defend against attacks, dari?
<Ray> 02The first one.
<Angel_Espeon> 13If you were using homing amulets, that stage should be really easy xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well not easy
<Angel_Espeon> 13but easier
<Angel_Espeon> 13and fun
<Ray> 02yeah, I know
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, !!octavia is legit
<Ray> 02Still...
<Ray> 02> Silly Mistakes
<Hipster_Brony> 8he/she is on the "contact us" page now
<Ghosties> 4New mod?
<Ray> 02I said like: Hi bullet, how are you today. do you mind if I run into you?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<Ghosties> 4Won't there be someone else to replace the other lost mod?
<Hipster_Brony> 8probably
*Ray still rages
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<Roarafk> 6whats annoying is getting through an entire apttern
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's basically just a stage filled with streaming bullets
<Roarafk> 6pattern
<prince-dari> For the moment, we can defend against pretty much any attacks.
<Angel_Espeon> 13just be ready to deathbomb if you make a mistake xD
<Roarafk> 6but running BACKWARDS into a stray
<Silverscreen> We're missing mods?
*Ray also got waaaay to used to deathbombing in IN
<Ray> 02;-;
<Polarfire> 0I can't irritate ghosties like bjornfot can :(
<Ray> 02I hate you, Mokuo.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I used to be like that
<Polarfire> 0Silverscreen: you're late XD
<Silverscreen> Yes, I am.
<Angel_Espeon> 13then after playing things like MoF where you're given no time to deathbomb at all
<SirSprinkles> 6...I need the slowpoke image.
<SirSprinkles> 6Now.
<Hipster_Brony> 8silver, you missed that whole thing?
<Polarfire> 0On it!
<Angel_Espeon> 13I adapted so that I'd bomb just a split second before I actually get hit
<Hipster_Brony> 8spike and twilight both stepped down
<Hipster_Brony> 8on the same day, actually
<Angel_Espeon> 13then again, sometimes I have these annoying moments
<Silverscreen> Spike did? Wow
<Angel_Espeon> 13where I can clearly see a bullet about to hit me
<Angel_Espeon> 13but for some damn reason
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't click the bomb button
<Angel_Espeon> 13.w.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was bad too
<Silverscreen> I'm actually glad Twilight's gone, but Spike was pretty cool.
<Ghosties> 4Bad?
<Polarfire> 0Sprinkles what image?
<Hipster_Brony> 8in case you didnt know, spike was steven magnet
<Silverscreen> Really? No shit.
<Aurora> 6i hate that lol
<Polarfire> 0plot twists abound
<Hipster_Brony> 8he was really upset and stressed about everything
<Hipster_Brony> 8he sent a rambling message to amonisis saying ponychan was dead and then asked for and received a permaban from the site
<Ghosties> 4o.o wow
<Ghosties> 4He must have been really, really upset
<NightSeas> 12!Pokemon
<Hipster_Brony> 8and theres some other stuff too
<ScriptBot> NightSeas, you are a 7Natu.
<Ghosties> 4...Ponychan, it does stuff to people
<Polarfire> 0that's why I don't ponychan.
<prince-dari> ^
<prince-dari> Too much drama.
<Polarfire> 0I stay here :)
<NightSeas> 12Yay
<Polarfire> 0much better environment with more friends
<Hipster_Brony> 8he dragged all of his personal issues out into the open and basically got someone to write a text wall on /meta/ blasting orange
<Aurora> 6!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Aurora, you are a 10Whismur.
<Aurora> 6nope
<Silverscreen> I ponychan, but I avoid any unnessasary drama.
<Ray> 02!pokemon
<Ghosties> 4Is...is the thread still around?
<ScriptBot> Ray, you are a 9Feraligatr.
<Ray> 02:3c
<Silverscreen> Who's Orange?
<Hipster_Brony> 8probably, lemme check
<Ghosties> 4Orange is an admin
<Hipster_Brony> 8orange = !!Celestia
<Angel_Espeon> 13!pokemon
<Ghosties> 4on Ponychan
<ScriptBot> Angel_Espeon, you are a 2Geodude.
<Angel_Espeon> 13:|
<Aurora> 6duuuuuuude
<Ray> 02>D
<Ghosties> 4Well goddamn, I didn't know that
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Silverscreen> Oh, right.
<Silverscreen> I remember now.
<lightumbreon> 06ohai GL :3
<NightSeas> 12Hiya lightumbreon :3
<Hipster_Brony> 8here it is: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/meta/res/20846.html
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think orange deleted the first paragraph cuz it was just a bunch of personal attacks
<prince-dari> "So I ask you, the users, how did we get to this moment in time, where the love and tolerance is not flowing as it once was? We have been consumed with hate, new members aren’t welcome, and there is a lack of respect for those who dedicate time and effort to us, the ponychan community"
<prince-dari> It's crap like that puts me off.
<Hipster_Brony> 8this is pretty much the most important post: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/meta/res/20846.html#20940
<prince-dari> Just making pointless drama, "WHY U NO LOVE EVERYWHERE", people on there are generally nice, why make a big deal out of nothing?
<Polarfire> 0^
<Ghosties> 4You haven't been on Ponychan long have you, dari?
<Hipster_Brony> 8and btw, that is the angriest you will ever see orange
<Polarfire> 0what was the deal with "lemon injuring himself"
<prince-dari> Lemon was one of the many suicidal people who post on ponychan.
<Ghosties> 4Lemon said he was going to go away or something after his Rainbow Dash toy came in the mail
<Silverscreen> Lemon threatened to kill himself.
<Ghosties> 4And what ensued was something interesting
<Silverscreen> The best damn thread Ponychan ever had.
<Ghosties> 4Over 1000 posts
<Ghosties> 4One guy getting blasted for being a troll
<Ghosties> 4Even if his intentions were pure
<Polarfire> 0wow
<Ghosties> 4!!Pinkie Pie making sure Lemon was alright, called the authorities
<Hipster_Brony> 8wasnt that how he got permabanned from the site?
<Ghosties> 4And many were rejoicing when Lemon returned to the thread the next day
<Hipster_Brony> 8i forget his exact name
<Ghosties> 4Lemon was permabanned?
<Ghosties> 4Why?
<Hipster_Brony> 8no no
<Hipster_Brony> 8the guy who was trolling
<Ghosties> 4He was right in his very first post though
<Ghosties> 4At least, I agreed with it
<Ghosties> 4But yeah
<Ghosties> 4It spilled out into a debacle over on /meta/
<Ghosties> 4I'm sure he's probably permabanned
<Hipster_Brony> 8i know for a fact hes ban on sight, i just couldnt remember if thats what caused it
<Ghosties> 4He kept causing trouble and he was ban evading
<Ghosties> 4numerous times in that same thread
<Ghosties> 4just to take jabs at the mods
<Silverscreen> I agree that Ponychan's love an tolerance has waned a little, but that'll happen no matter what community you're in.
<prince-dari> Ghosties: Not that long no, but I've been on it since March I think.
<SirSprinkles> 6*was doing something*
<SirSprinkles> 6*looks back*
<prince-dari> How long have you been on it for?
<SirSprinkles> 6*sees this discussion*
<Polarfire> 0Itll get better when season 2 comes out.
<SirSprinkles> 6>>;
<Polarfire> 0Theyre all just bored right now.
<Polarfire> 0That's why I don't ponychan.
<Silverscreen> ^
<lightumbreon> 06wb GL
<NightSeas> 12Thanks
<Polarfire> 0lol sprinkles.
<Ghosties> 4How long have you been actively on Ponychan, dari?
<prince-dari> Since March.
<Ghosties> 4You've been on like everyday and question all this?
<Ghosties> 4Really?
<prince-dari> Yeah, I tend to just lurk.
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles, i know that feel
<prince-dari> How do you think I found out about the first BMN? :P
<Ghosties> 4People on Ponychan make big deals out of nothing
<Ghosties> 4That's just Ponychan for you
<Silverscreen> Ghosties: That's any fandom for you.
<Ghosties> 4That has so much truth, Silver
<prince-dari> ...I don't see it anywhere near as much as I do on ponychan.
<Ghosties> 4What have I gotten myself into?
*Nickario gives Nighseas a piece of power
<Hipster_Brony> 8save it for the weekly /meta/ thread about love and tolerance guys
<prince-dari> Always "people don't love and tolerate any more" "this place used to be great, now we're heading down the path", and I just think "wut".
<Polarfire> 0Well since all the mods are here can we stream something :p
<Ghosties> 4I don't go to /meta/ unless for the laughs

<Hipster_Brony> 8o hai sathi
<Sathi> god left4 is fun :)
<prince-dari> First or second?
<NewDCD> sup guys
<Sathi> second
<NewDCD> Sathi has been playing L4D2 with me lately
<prince-dari> Hey.
<SirSprinkles> Oh look, DCD.
<Ghosties> 4They're both good games
<NewDCD> so I gotta say
<Polarfire> 0now I'm not the only one who can be kicked :D
<NewDCD> the only problem I have with her
<Ghosties> Yeah, DCD?
<Sathi> so true
<NewDCD> is the fact that she uses ": ) " a lot
<NewDCD> but I suppose that's more because of
<Ghosties> What's wrong with that?
<NewDCD> english not being her first language
<Sathi> oh and I see a timer :)
<Sathi> nice one
<SirSprinkles> Hey, DCD, are we officially doing the showing of ep 1 and 2 for Brony Appreciation Day?
<Ghosties> SHE SHOULD PLAY KILLING FLOOR
<Polarfire> 0lol
<prince-dari> Yeah, the timer needs fixing.
<Ghosties> I should ask her to play Killing Floor
<Sathi> fixing in what way?

<Polarfire> 0ho hum
<Hipster_Brony> 8link fail
<Ghosties> 4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q77sJT8O56E
<Ghosties> 4Remember when I said I was watching teens being dumbasses?
<prince-dari> So there's a module for unrealIRCd which can redirect people who are banned from one channel to another channel.
<Ghosties> 4>link
<NewDCD> Sprinkles: yeah
<prince-dari> I was thinking that'd be good, banned people get redirected to the appeal room.
<NewDCD> but I don't know if I'll be available on Friday
<SirSprinkles> Should we just make it 6 PM for the ep 1 and 2?
<Espeon> 06Yawn
<SirSprinkles> It's cool, I can handle it if you can't dude.
<Espeon> 06Or well, not really
<Hipster_Brony> thats what i was planning on putting in the schedule for tomorrow
<Espeon> 06But it tends to wake people up (just to yawn)
<Polarfire> 0Ghosties: woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<SirSprinkles> Sounds good.
<Hipster_Brony> 8good idea dari
<Polarfire> 0oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
<prince-dari> Ghosties: One of the reasons America scares me.
<Ghosties> 4Teem Werewolves
<Polarfire> 0this makes me angey
<Ghosties> 4*Teen
<SirSprinkles> I'm going to the discussion thread to put in an announcement about it then.
<Polarfire> 0*angry
<Ghosties> 4NOT EMO, NOT GOTH
<Polarfire> 0I don't know why.
<NightSeas> 12Or put them to sleep X3
<Polarfire> 0but it does.
<prince-dari> "captured the attention of teenagers"
<prince-dari> >implying I like that crap
<NewDCD> link to said thread?
<prince-dari> I wish I wouldn't be associated with other that stuff just because of my age.
<SirSprinkles> Just a sec.
<Hipster_Brony> sounds good sprinkles
<HyperMetalLugia> :)
<SirSprinkles> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/35713320.html
<Sathi> I don't know your age, is that a good thing?
<Sathi> and imo.. age does not matter much nowadays
<Ghosties> 4Is what a good thing?
<Polarfire> 0especially not online.
<Sathi> exactly
<NightSeas> 12That question you gave me fried my brain .-.
<Polarfire> 0well. ghosties. that was creepy
<prince-dari>                            
<Ghosties> 4I thought Hipsters were the new target of society?
<Ghosties> 4No offense to Hipster himself
<SirSprinkles> ...lol typo'd.
<Polarfire> 0no more soon?
<Ghosties> Alright, are we ready for the interview?
<Hipster_Brony> 8polar: not right now, but http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l9bssvphCr1qdprjio1_500.jpg
<prince-dari|SOON> Has anyone ever really been as far as decided to want to do look more like?
<Hipster_Brony> lemme get the pics quick
<Polarfire> 0XD
<Hipster_Brony> also
<Hipster_Brony> i thought metal link was at 4 and sathi was at 5
<Ghosties> What's the room?
<Ghosties> BronyStateInterview?
<Ghosties> 4Do ho ho
<Hipster_Brony> yeah
<NightSeas> 12Yes XD
<Ghosties> Alright
<Polarfire> 0you guys and your jokes.
<Sathi> heh we're working our way towards 5000 pages now in the MLP FIM topic
<Espeon> 06You’ve got to be kidding me. I’ve been further even more decided to use even go need to do look more as anyone can. Can you really be far even as decided half as much to use go wish for that? My guess is that when one really been far even as decided once to use even go want, it is then that he has really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like.
<Espeon> 06It’s just common sense.
<Ghosties> 4DATTTTS US MODS!
<Ghosties> Well, if Metal Link doesn't show up this time
<Ghosties> Seriously
<Ghosties> This will be the third interview he's missed
<Flutterpeanut> No Such channel. D:
<NightSeas> 12lol
<Polarfire> 0lol. Ghosties you never showed me your writing :(
<Ghosties> 4I don't want to
<Flutterpeanut> Found it
<Ghosties> 4Like, no offense and I don't mean to be blunt XD
<Polarfire> 0oh...
<Polarfire> 0its ok.
<Ghosties> 4But I thought it over and I just don't want to expose more of my personal life to the net
<Luna> My brain hurts
<Hipster_Brony> yeah, 3 strikes and he's out
<Polarfire> 0its fine. I understand.
<Ghosties> 4Some things must be kept private : )
<Ghosties> 4Thank you for understanding though
<prince-dari|SOON> But surely if you've even been as far as decided to want to do look more like then you would have been further than decided to want to use look more like, so you'd have to carefully go along with the decision to use even go need to do more like, which would be harder than if you just did want to go do look more like.
<Ghosties> Alright, EVERYONE PILE INTO THE INTERVIEW ROOM
<NewDCD> link me
<NewDCD> hashmark ain't working for me for some reason
<Ghosties> BronyStateInterview

<HyperMetalLugia> that is stupid
<Ghosties> o.o
<Ghosties> where
<Ghosties> where did sathi go?
<NightSeas> 12In the mind of an Espeon it does
*HyperMetalLugia ignore Espeona dn Dari for the derp
<Ghosties> Oh
<Hipster_Brony> well sathi doesnt have to be here until 5 anyway
<prince-dari|SOON> Clearly you've just never really been as far a decided to use want to do look more like.
<Ghosties> There she is

<prince-dari> We all know rainbow is best colour.
<Polarfire> 0well.
<prince-dari> Just as Rainbow is best pony.
<TurniBrony> So what are you guys doing?
<prince-dari> (:
<Ghosties> 4We're doing stuff
<Polarfire> 0^
<Nickario> oh cool did i arrive onto a zelda topic discussion? :3
<Ghosties> 4What an odd way to spell Vinyl Scratch...
<Hipster_Brony> 8dammit, alright
<Nickario> and Hai Espeon
<Hipster_Brony> 8be back http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l9bssvphCr1qdprjio1_500.jpg
<Ghosties> Lol
<TurniBrony> I see.
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats true dari
*prince-dari wasn't spelling Vinyl Scratch. (:
<Polarfire> 0Is is soon yet?
<Ghosties> 4Are you sure?
<SirSprinkles> 6...that's not how you spell Apple Bloom...
<Nickario> cos I finished OOT 3D and downloaded link's awakening to 3DS
<Luna> Interesting how that phrase came to be, now that I looked it up
<SirSprinkles> 6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/35713320.html
<Hipster_Brony> 8ghosties, do you mind finding that cupcakes pic and linking it for me while im on ponibooru?
<prince-dari> It's how you spell Rainbow Dash, because she's best pony.
<SirSprinkles> 6Announcements are fun.
<Ghosties> Sure thing
<Nickario> hai luna
<Luna> Heya
<Luna> How're you?
<HyperMetalLugia> I need to go back to OOt3D
<Polarfire> 0hooray
<Hipster_Brony> 8PONIBOORU, Y U NO LOAD FASTER?!
<Nickario> yes you should
*Nickario runs
<TurniBrony> 6PM? But that's when I practice in the debate team. ;P
<Ghosties> 4"Best" is purely subjective
<Nickario> also here's a photo of my pic in the nintendo magazine http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b88/nick-metroid/b1bcef97.jpg
<Ghosties> http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=35k8p74&s=7
<Ghosties> For Hip :3
<Luna> You got in the nintendo magazine?
<Luna> That's awesome
<Polarfire> 0Speedy mod round... like 30 I think... GO!
<Flutterpeanut> 13I quite enjoy Derpy.
<Nickario> original here http://www.lugia.us/gallery/displayimage.php?album=lastupby&cat=0&pid=1074&uid=389#top_display_media
<prince-dari> Take best to mean most popular. Rainbow Dash is best pony.
<Ghosties> 4I can tell, Peanut :P
<prince-dari> Derpy is second best pony.
<Hipster_Brony> 8sigh
<Nickario> and yeah luna :3 I've tried to get a pic featured in there mag for years
<Hipster_Brony> 8fuck this picture
<Ghosties> 4And I thought Fluttershy was most popular pony
<Polarfire> 0shame shame guys...
<prince-dari> Lies and slander.
<Ghosties> 4Not if Hasbro says so
<Nickario> thing is I didn't even submit that one to them directly, I just posted it in their fan art thread and they got it from there
<Hipster_Brony> 8derpy is a good pony, but rainbow dash is best pony
<Polarfire> 11eeyup
<Polarfire> 11shame
<Luna> Maybe that's the way to get it in then :P
<Polarfire> 0well I guess ghosties saved you guys
<Nickario> heh I just hope people will be able to recognise it now if they see it on DA
<Polarfire> 0Even Dari fell behind on that one.
<TurniBrony> Dari kind of tunes out. Atleast last night
<Polarfire> 0He's been doing great so far though.
<Flutterpeanut> 13DERPY IS BEST PONY.
<Flutterpeanut> 13I WILL DERP YOUR SHIT
<Luna> I don't say many people use that name, they'd recognize it if they saw it probably
<Hipster_Brony> 8how about i rainboom your shit?
<Nickario> o.o lol the artist to a picture on DA I commented on their picture replied finally
<Nickario> from 2005 xD
<Nickario> when I commented originally I mean
<Ghosties> 4How about I scratch your shit?
<Luna> Laaaate
<prince-dari> Your shit needs to be 20% cooler.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i told sathi we might start the interview early and she said thats fine, she'll be here
<Polarfire> 0well since Dari is tuned out this is the chance for someone else to take the lead...
<Polarfire> 0Anybody?
<Hipster_Brony> 8so as soon as i find some pics we can start
<Polarfire> 0nope he's back.
<Ghosties> 4It's more than 20% cooler
<Ghosties> 4It's fucking vinyl, baby
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would say at least half of the memes come from dash, even though she gets the least amount of screentime out of the mane 6
<prince-dari> She gets least screentime?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<prince-dari> She's just so awesome that the little time she has is the most memorable.
*Sathi giggles softly
<Hipster_Brony> 8some guy went through and documented screentime for each character in the first season
<Polarfire> 0well do you guys know what slow chat calls for?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think twilight and applejack had the most
<prince-dari> Lol, my least favourite ponies.
<prince-dari> Have most screentime.
<Hipster_Brony> 8and dash and fluttershy had the least
<Hipster_Brony> 8iirc
<Ghosties> 4Twilight is the main protagonist though
<Hipster_Brony> 8hey, i like twilight
<Ghosties> 4It makes sense that she has the most screentime
<TurniBrony> idklol
<Polarfire> 0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
<Flutterpeanut> 13Aren't we supposed to be doing something?
<RainBroDash> Have I missed an interview? sorry about the lateness, my mother's just got home from a while away and we've had some important shit to discuss
<Polarfire> 0Is it PARTYTEIM?

<Ghosties> BronyStateInterview
<Polarfire> 0are you suuuuuure?
<prince-dari> How many times have you been kicked today Polarfire?
<Ghosties> 4Spiderman, I...
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, metal link didnt show for the interview
<RainBroDash> already in :P
<Polarfire> 0Its beem over 25 I'm sure.
<Hipster_Brony> 8we're gonna start interviewing sathi soon, but i need to find some pics first
<Polarfire> 0I wish I would have counted.
<RainBroDash> 10Did Metal Link miss another? :/
<Polarfire> 0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<RainBroDash> 10are we ignoring the chance that his internet is actually screwed up again?
<prince-dari> ...
<RainBroDash> 10or are we letting him attempt to explain his absence
<RainBroDash> oh polar you so random :3
<Polarfire> 0o hai rainbro!
<Hipster_Brony> 8he said last week was the first time in 4 years it happened
<RainBroDash> :D
<Hipster_Brony> 8so im inclined to think he just forgot
<RainBroDash> 10hm
<Hipster_Brony> 8but regardless, i dont think we can mod someone who isnt reliable
<prince-dari> I should have a script.
<Ghosties> 4We just can't
<prince-dari> To see who has been kicked the most.
<RainBroDash> 10just saying in case it's not him that's not reliable and it's actually just his hardware
<Ghosties> 4This will be the third time he's missed it
<Ghosties> 4Maybe so, but THREE times
<RainBroDash> 10I mean I'm just trying to play devil's advocate here, don't shoot me :D
<Polarfire> 0can you check?
<Ghosties> 4We can't afford to have him not show up for a BMN because of faulty hardware
<Hipster_Brony> 8even if it is his hardware, we shouldnt be modding someone who doesnt have a reliable internet connection
<RainBroDash> 10anyone can spontaneously get shitty hardware out of nowhere :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, he's out for sure
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<RainBroDash> 10alrighty then :D
<prince-dari> I'll check my log.
<Polarfire> 0:3
<TurniBrony> Did you log the debate from last night? :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8god damn fucking ponibooru is taking FOREVER to load
<Polarfire> 0see how many times I've been kicked today if you don't mind.
<prince-dari> I log everything. :P
<TurniBrony> The fic I linked was better. :P
<prince-dari> Today you've been kicked 33 times.
<Polarfire> 0lol
<Polarfire> 0and turni don't go there. Its too early.
<Polarfire> 0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
<TurniBrony> Never too early.
<prince-dari> You're the king of being kicked. :P
<Polarfire> 0egg? what egg? I see no egg.
<prince-dari> :P
<TurniBrony> Seems like Polarfire has a bad case of "nothing to do today"

<drf-Droid> so, at the tire place now
<Polarfire> 0just a lazy wednesday. And dari you aren't setting any records. You're getting slower.

<RainBroDash> xD
<Polarfire> 0He's just not the speedkicker he used to be I guess.
<HyperMetalLugia> 3G FTW?
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean, poor tire :<

<prince-dari> XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<prince-dari> You too slow. :P
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<Polarfire> 0Well since apparently Dari is the fastest mod by a lot, lets see who is 2nd. For my 40th kick of the day, what mod, besides Dari, is worthy of any glory? GO!
<Hipster_Brony> 8i should save these pics or something, but then again i dont really want to have them saved
<RainBroDash> not me
<Hipster_Brony> 8especially not the cupcakes one
<Hipster_Brony> 8too busy to kick
<Hipster_Brony> 8ghosties, you there?

<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I still have the human Rarity/AJ
<Ghosties> 4Do you want it?
<Polarfire> 0I guess Dari IS the best mod after all...
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah

<Sparky> 'ey Nick

<RainBroDash> 10hah
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, im gonna bring sathi in now
<Polarfire> 0Dari you sly dog!
<Polarfire> 0Alright... 2 can play that game...
<Flutterpeanut> 13Why did I click on that.
<Ghosties> 4Who's giving the interview?
<Polarfire> 0http://www.nomad4ever.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/egg_on_the_face.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> 8do you mind doing it ghosties?
<Ghosties> 4Sure
<NightSeas> 12hi drf
<Sathi> Goodevening / afternoon
<Ghosties> 4...what a great time for my computer to be derping on me >.<
<Flutterpeanut> 13Indeed. Good Afternoon. =D
<Ghosties> 4Hello, Sathi
<prince-dari> Hey Sathi.
<Sathi> Hello all,
<ScriptBot> [1,0You0,4Tube]: Trolling Saruman | by PistolShrimps | Length: | Views: 1 903 505
<Polarfire> 0hmm.
<Flutterpeanut> 13nope
<Flutterpeanut> 13xP
<Ghosties> 4Sathi, you're here for an interview for a position in the BMN mods. This will be a two part interview. First, I will ask you a series of questions
<Sneas> 03So apparantly I'm getting a new ISP in a couple weeks.
<Ghosties> 4Are you ready?
*Sathi nods
<Ghosties> 4To begin, that is
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<Polarfire> 0I wonder if...
<Ghosties> 4First question, why do you want to be a moderator for the Brony Movie Night?
<Polarfire> 0http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/4b9b58a37f8b9a3667640600-401-305/egg-on-face.jpg
<Sneas> 03I hope they're able to install the router and stuff since my computer doesn't have Windows on it .-.
<prince-dari> I'm busy now. :P
<Flutterpeanut> Nyan
<Polarfire> 0Did you write a script for that image XD
<Polarfire> 0or were you just being speedy
<Hipster_Brony> 8this whole thing with metal link might work out, cuz now we can hire soarin and not have too many mods
<Sathi> Hmm that's an easy starter; well first of all I enjoyed attending all the movie nights so far. It's nice to watch with a large fan-base to movies and such and in general have fun together. To be honest ever since I found the show on youtube i'm sold. And the best thing would be working in a team with people which share the same interests.
<Ghosties> Remember, if you guys have a question don't hesitate to say something
<Ghosties> In the interview, that is
<Flutterpeanut> Doh. Do we talk about the answers in here?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes
<Flutterpeanut> Okie.
<Ghosties> 4Well, then I guess I don't have to ask you how many BMNs you've been too. In that case, I will move on.
<Ghosties> 4What can you offer us as a mod on the team? That is, what can you bring that will benefit us?
<Polarfire> 0Is is soon yet?
<Ghosties> Yep, we deliberate in here
<Sathi> As in experience or any other benefits?
<Ghosties> 4Both
<prince-dari> Well experience is a benefit. O_o
<Ghosties> 4Whatever you can offer us
<Flutterpeanut> Yup.
<Flutterpeanut> xD
<Ghosties> True, but an in depth explanation isn't bad
<SirSprinkles> Also, check my awesome new timer. : D
<Sathi> Well as I stated in the application form I have already experience as moderator / teamleader / projectleader
<Polarfire> 0U still here rainbro?
<Sathi> I am a positive thinker, try to help how we can improve things as an example the timer on the current page.
<RainBroDash> kinda busy for a little bit mr polar <3
<Flutterpeanut> May have to f5
<Flutterpeanut> Later.
<Flutterpeanut> xP
<Sathi> I'm a teamplayer and I know how to deal with feedback.
<Hipster_Brony> 8true, that timer was sathi's idea
<SirSprinkles> Just open a new tab to look.
<SirSprinkles> It was.
<RainBroDash> 10oh, brilliant
<SirSprinkles> A long while back.
<Ghosties> Gonna ask about the project leader bit, if you guys don't mind
<RainBroDash> 10that's proof of a good brainstormer's mind ;P
<SirSprinkles> Go for it.
<Flutterpeanut> Oh nice.
<RainBroDash> 10I think that's a good idea
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, she's been asking about it for a few weeks
<Ghosties> 4Could you explain the "project leader" bit? It implies that you were doing more than just overseeing operations and moderating.
<SirSprinkles> I just put it in now since I remembered about her asking, actually.
*Altair awake now
<Sathi> that's correct but that's regarding my real-life occupation
<Polarfire> 0oh... all the mods got busy at once and now I can't get kicked anymore :(
<Sneas> 03xD
<Altair> Sneas, as long as it uses an ethernet cable you'll be ok :D
<Sneas> 03I hope
<Altair> Also sorry for not responding to PMs yesterday D:
<Sneas> 03Linux isn't listed as supported on their site
<Hipster_Brony> 8you don't have to go into detail if you don't want, but can you give us a general idea?
<Altair> irssi doesn't exactly go out of it's way to show new ones lol
<Sneas> 03I'll be getting a new router/everything probably xD
<Sneas> 03It's ok xD
<Sathi> Hmm of course. I just don't want to brag or anything
<Polarfire> 0haha.
<Altair> My modem is also a (wireless) router
<Altair> but
<Altair> it sucks
<Polarfire> 0I guess I'll go roam the internet for a little while then until things pick up.
<Altair> i.e. no upnp
<Sneas> 03This is all thanks to my mom, of course, without asking me first
<Altair> :?
<RainBroDash> 10Is it worth saying that Sathi should be able to say anything, and that we'll understand it as not being bragging, since of course this is an interview
<Altair> * :/
<Sathi> It means companies could hire me for projects. First I would write a business case, recruit a team and when the business agrees start the project
<Sneas> 03On the upside
<Altair> my mom is likely to switch ISPs when i leave
<Altair> as uverse is a fucking lot of money
<SirSprinkles> Not at the moment.
<Polarfire> 0:(
<RainBroDash> 10alrighty :)
<Sneas> 03It'll be much faster than what I have now
<Sathi> Of course the business case must meet all the company requirement
<Ghosties> Right, she should be showcasing her achievements and abilities
<Sneas> 03Leave? o.o
<Altair> :D
<RainBroDash> 10yeah i just think it's the one time that showing off is credible, you know
<Altair> huh?
<Ghosties> But again, I'm not expecting to be displeased during the questions. It's the pictures part that concerns me
<Flutterpeanut> Yeah
<Sathi> Is that enough details for you?
<SirSprinkles> There's a difference between saying what you can do and bragging though.
<Sneas> 03Are you moving out?
<Altair> Oh
<Ghosties> That is true
<Altair> well, i'm going to college
<Altair> so kinda sorta
<Altair> :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8i actually liked the fact that she said it
<Hipster_Brony> 8shows she can stay humble
<Hipster_Brony> 8and ghosties, are you ready to move on?
<Altair> i mean, uverse is like, the best for home servers
<Altair> although i hate AT&T with a passion
<drf|WorstBuy> happened to be across the street from the tire place
<Ghosties> Not just yet
<Ghosties> One more question
<RainBroDash> 10well it shows that she has a clear mind on the significance of the interview process, sure
<Flutterpeanut> Same.
<Sparky> lol
<Altair> for trying to get all of these anti-piracy things started
<Sneas> 03Oh D:
<Altair> but on the upside, it's fast as fuck and no matter what, i have a static IP
<Ghosties> 4What ideas do you have to expand the Brony Movie Night? Also, what ideas do you have to improve the Brony Movie Night?
<Altair> so good for server but bad for me in general lol
<Sneas> 03I'm lucky to go to college like 7 miles away from here
<Sneas> 03xD
<Ghosties> I realize that she came up with the countdown timer up top
<Altair> yeah... i'm 3 hours away
<Hipster_Brony> 8"the" brony movie night lol
<Ghosties> But I wanna see what else she thinks
<Sneas> 03D:
<Altair> so i gotta find some way to start up the server in case of power failure
<Altair> i may get a UPC
<RainBroDash> 10hah
<Sathi> humm thats a good question, the idea with the clock I suggested via e-mail
<Ghosties> Whatevs, nothing wrong with emphasizing it
<Sathi> But sadly I found out the Brony Movie Night also has some bad reputation
<Sneas> 03o:?
<SirSprinkles> ...Oo
<Ghosties> Bad reputation?
<SirSprinkles> Bad rep?
<RainBroDash> 10O.o
<Flutterpeanut> Wut
<Sathi> I will do everything within my powers to change that. I even lured a couple of friends in to watch the show with me.
<Ghosties> This intrigues me
<Altair> that way i don't have to give a fuck if the power goes out :P
<RainBroDash> 10although it's probably not appropriate to discuss now
<Ghosties> I have to ask what the bad rep is about
<SirSprinkles> Ask for elaboration? Oo
<RainBroDash> 10we should probably stay on track
<Altair> (our electric company sucks)
<Ghosties> I thought about that
<Flutterpeanut> 13If you don't mind me asking, Bad Rep? I don't recall seeing this anywhere.
*Nickario has returned
<SirSprinkles> This is... kinda important.
<Nickario> with Sandvich
<Ghosties> We'll discuss later
<prince-dari> We have a bad reputation...?
<SirSprinkles> And we need to know her source on it.
<Ghosties> Fuck
<RainBroDash> 10after the interview maybe?
<Flutterpeanut> Well too late
<Flutterpeanut> :S
<Ghosties> Oh well
<Flutterpeanut> 13Ah. Ignore that.
<Altair> ^ i should really change that lol
<RainBroDash> 10lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8no, this is the appropriate time to ask about it
<SirSprinkles> Well, we need to know where she's getting this info anyway.
<Ghosties> WE HAVE TO GO FORWARD
<SilverSonic> yes you should
<SilverSonic> GET TO IT BOY
*SilverSonic shot
<Ghosties> 4No, please explain
<Altair> wait what
<Sneas> 03XD
<Flutterpeanut> 13Or. Explain.
<Ghosties> Peanut already put us one foot in the fire, gotta go all the way now
<Espeon> 06good times
<SilverSonic> Get to it Chooooooooooooop chop chop
<Sneas> 03I hate the power company here too
*SilverSonic shot again
<RainBroDash> 10well it's like it feels like the answer to this question is completely not affecting sathi's possible mod status, thus i feel it's not appropriate RIGHT now
<Flutterpeanut> I'M SORRY.
<Flutterpeanut> XD
<Altair> :/
<Ghosties> I'm completely agree with you, RBD, but it's already out there
<drf|WorstBuy> http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384373202.png
<Altair> at the first bolt of lighting
<SirSprinkles> Well, the thing is, it is important to hiring her.
<Altair> ning
<SilverSonic> wuts wrong with your Power co?
<Sneas> 03They also like charging an arm and a leg for it too
<drf|WorstBuy> apparently Best Buy is their own ISP
<Ghosties> We might as well find out now
<Sathi> As an example; i'm also a active community member of mmo-champion.. We have a MLP / FIM topic and I believe this week I posted the letter that Hipster wrote to hasbro.. people did not respond to it al all. Also I promoted the BMN night but people said there's too much spam / inmaturity and such.. others just tune in to watch the movie but complain alot about.
<SirSprinkles> We need to know how she found this out.
<Altair> OH DERP THERE GOES THE POWER
<Sathi> technical issues; lag and such
<Altair> LETS WAIT THREE HOURS BEFORE TURNING IT BACK ON
<Altair> etc
<SirSprinkles> As in, what kind of contacts she has.
<RainBroDash> 10alright, I suppose
<Hipster_Brony> 8i want to find out because it can give us an example of how she can handle situations like this
<Altair> yeah same hre
<Altair> here
<prince-dari> Oh, lag.
<Sneas> 03Well one day it randomly went off for like 4 hours
<SilverSonic> LOL DRf said best buy instead of WorstBuy XD
<Flutterpeanut> Oh.
<Flutterpeanut> Lol.
<Hipster_Brony> 8that one night with starship troopers...
<Altair> that happens too
<Altair> back in 2001
<Altair> er
<drf|WorstBuy> I know
<SirSprinkles> mmo-champion...
<Altair> 2004
<Altair> there was a pretty bad ice storm
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont even know what that is lol
<RainBroDash> 10don't underestimate mmo-champion
<Altair> we lost power for two weeks
<Sneas> 03Then it came on and off several times and fried the power supply to my computer so I had to pay $80 to fix it
<RainBroDash> 10they have a HUGE brony thread fanbase
<prince-dari> I thought she meant bad reputation due to something more personal than technical.
<RainBroDash> 10it's ginormous
<SirSprinkles> Oh, I know.
<Altair> ^ fucking hate that
<Altair> ._.
<Ghosties> Yeah, I was thinking more personal grudges as well
<Sneas> 03Wow D:
<SirSprinkles> I'm saying that they expect a lot of everything and anything there.
<Ghosties> But the lag thing is okay
<Angel_Espeon> 13http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384376080.png
<Angel_Espeon> 13cry
<Ghosties> Or understandable at least
<Angel_Espeon> 13;-;
<Sathi> but on the other hand, I believe ponies and these movie nights is a hobby of all of us? I'll just keep trying to promote the european night more.
<Altair> some parts of charlotte lost it for like
<Sneas> 03I think the power bill's like $130 something a month
<Altair> a month or so
<Sathi> Less speedy chat and such :)
<SirSprinkles> I do agree with the childish comment, at times.
<Hipster_Brony> 8how do you deal with those people?
<Altair> that's the price of uverse
<Altair> total
<Altair> i think
<drf|WorstBuy> LOL D-
<Sneas> 03Wow
<Sneas> 03xD
<Altair> other than the internet, it sucks too
<drf|WorstBuy> I think my phone gets faster speeds than that
<Altair> i mean
<RainBroDash> browser derped
<Altair> phone = phone, can't really suck too bad
<Altair> but the tv servicd
<Altair> e
<Sathi> it's their opinion, which I respect, but the friends that tuned in actually enjoyed the show.
<RainBroDash> what's the interview room again?
<Ghosties> Well, you're gonna get that when you're catering to more than one person
<Altair> the boxes run a modified windows ce
<Ghosties> BronyStateInterview
<Altair> and it's slow
<Altair> :(
<Flutterpeanut> hm.
<Altair> so it takes like 2 minutes to load a recording
<Sneas> 03D:
<RainBroDash> it says that's not right
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yep, it's hard to find anything slower than my computer these days .-.
<RainBroDash> "No such channel BronyStateInterview"
<Altair> but i hardly watch the tele anyway, that's my dad's thing
<Altair> lol
<Sathi> Every week I keep promoting BMN on our forums / facebook though
<Ghosties> *shrugs* ?
<prince-dari> #bronystateinterview
<SirSprinkles> You have to put # in front of the channel name
<SilverSonic> Poor AE :<
<RainBroDash> lol'd.
<Ghosties> I thought RBD knew that...
<Espeon> 06I guess I'll join in, http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384378723.png
<RainBroDash> I did it right the first time as well
<prince-dari> Also, isn't your countdown wrong Sprinkles?
<SirSprinkles> I like that she's been promoting for us.
*Espeon pets AE
<RainBroDash> momentary derp.
<SirSprinkles> No, it's not.
<Ghosties> Alright, well, Hip, are you ready to move on to the pictures?
<SilverSonic> adfhjsdjfol;sdk;fl
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, im ready
<SilverSonic> Jesus christ Xeli
*SilverSonic jelous
<SirSprinkles> I put it for the 6 PM showing of the eps.
<Ghosties> Alright, go ahead
<Hipster_Brony> 8does anyone have any other questions before i move on?
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Share some of that with meeee D:
<RainBroDash> I like the fact that she's tied into mmo-champion. we don't currently have any mods who play wow and shit so no-one has a need to be on there
<Espeon> 06last time I checked it was like 15 I don't know what happened
<Espeon> 06but that was a while ago
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, im gonna move on then
<SirSprinkles> I play mmos... just haven't been able to.
<Ghosties> 4Alright, thank you Sathi. Hipster_Brony will take over from here
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, we're gonna move on to the 2nd part of the interview
<Ghosties> Now comes the true test
<RainBroDash> well yeah, either way
<Ghosties> IMO at least
<HyperMetalLugia> Greedy
<Hipster_Brony> 8im going to show you 3 pictures
<RainBroDash> it's a real clincher
<Flutterpeanut> I can't play wow anymore.
<RainBroDash> at least
<Espeon> 06I would if I could but for now
<Hipster_Brony> 8and i want you to tell me how you would react if you were a mod and they were posted in chat
*Espeon cling =w=
<Flutterpeanut> Too.
<Flutterpeanut> Much.
<Hipster_Brony> 8any questions?
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 14 minutes
<Flutterpeanut> Redundancy
<Flutterpeanut> Eugh.
<RainBroDash> not the best time to get into it, but that game is just so bad now
<Sathi> ok bring it on :)
<RainBroDash> I've not looked back
<Flutterpeanut> eyup. Let us focus on teh interview
<SirSprinkles> I like the confidence.
<RainBroDash> hah
<Ghosties> I did as well
<prince-dari> [22:07] <Sathi> ok bring it on :) | I like it.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, 1st pic: http://oi55.tinypic.com/zja0yg.jpg
<RainBroDash> as did i
<Ghosties> Kinda put a smile on my face
<RainBroDash> same xD
<SirSprinkles> 6Also... colors. It feels weird typing in white anymore...
<SilverSonic> http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384381535.png Mine ;;
<Ghosties> Hope she doesn't screw up
<Hipster_Brony> 8so true sprinkles
<Angel_Espeon> 13Better than mine :<
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh hush SS
<Flutterpeanut> I find it comfortable to do in here
<HyperMetalLugia> that is WAY better than mine
<TurniBrony> What a shame
<Sathi> You want me to react with a personal reaction or how it should be done according to the rules?
<SirSprinkles> 6With important stuff, I like not having to look to see who's saying what.
<Ghosties> Ooooh, she knows the rules
<RainBroDash> 10postan teal
<SirSprinkles> 6So I actually like when everypony uses their color in here.
<Hipster_Brony> 8how would you react as a mod?
<Ghosties> 4You guys and your colors
<RainBroDash> 10ghosties I think it should be assumed that anyone with a decent enough level of intelligence to get mod has read the rules :P
<SilverSonic> ;3
<SirSprinkles> 6You would think
<Ghosties> 4You'd be surprised...
<RainBroDash> 10just my 2 cents, it shouldn't be a 'good' point, just a required point dude.
<Luna> SilverSonic, you want to see a bad one?
<Sathi> Well this is NSFW and I do not know which audience is attending the movie nights. I would either PM or ask the person the stop posting these images as we might have young viewers attending the show too
<RainBroDash> 10and I said "to get mod" not 'to apply for mod' :P
<Ghosties> 4...
<Luna> .. Once it loads
<Hipster_Brony> 8meh answer
<SirSprinkles> 6*shrug*
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, meh
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, 2nd pic: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/166cec130ee0ff62399f05414d8aa064/34397%20-%20artist%3ARayo%20flank%20Flankylicious%20plot%20Trixie.jpg
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384385396.png
<Flutterpeanut> She'll have to be a little more... Aggressive. Just a tad bit.
<SilverSonic> o_O
<Ghosties> 4Doesn't matter who's watching, really. It's rule 34 stuff, which means kick
<Espeon> 06I like how we have the same ping
<SirSprinkles> 6Nopony's ever aggressive enough, though.
<RainBroDash> 10I think this will be mostly decided on that last picture
<Espeon> 06almost
<Ghosties> 4RBD was
<SirSprinkles> 6True.
<Ghosties> 4He was the first actual assertive person we had
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ouch HML
<Angel_Espeon> 13D:
<RainBroDash> 10I was brutal, my bad. I get angry when people abuse environments such as this
<Angel_Espeon> 13That's depressing, but now I'm happy because there's someone here who knows how I feel xD
<SilverSonic> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> My connection is on wireless and I'm away from the router
<Ghosties> 4That's what we were looking for though
<SirSprinkles> 6We prefer assertive though, RBD.
<HyperMetalLugia> AND I DCED
<HyperMetalLugia> FUU
<Ghosties> 4We wanted professionalism
<Sathi> Hmm parts of me would be okay with this, but the other part would ask in mod chat / pm if it's allowed or not.. afterall every mod team has it's own rules
<SilverSonic> Lmfao
<SilverSonic> Dont blame WLM again :P
<HyperMetalLugia> So it is normally 230kb/s and 75kb/s upload
<HyperMetalLugia> Nah
<Ghosties> 4...it's not about being okay with it, Sathi. It's about being professional
<Luna> http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384387189.png
<Angel_Espeon> 13^ better than mine
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also
<SilverSonic> XD
<Flutterpeanut> If someone posts something like that you know they wont console to such a thing. It demands a warning kick and if it happens again, Ban.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm right next to our router
<Angel_Espeon> 13.w.
<Flutterpeanut> posting stuff like that.
<RainBroDash> 10just not fair on the other viewers when there's no prior content warning, and I think sathi is going to have to show that she can make a decision that someone is acting inappropriately, given the lack of content warning for the chat.
<Hipster_Brony> 8another meh answer
<Ghosties> 4Exactly
<Angel_Espeon> 13We've had a crappy ISP for the longest time
<Hipster_Brony> 8at least she said she would consult the mods though
<Ghosties> 4If she doesn't ban for the last one...
<HyperMetalLugia> Luna is worse
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<HyperMetalLugia> And whee
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, last pic: http://oi53.tinypic.com/35k8p74.jpg
<Luna> My dad's argued about ours for a very long time
<HyperMetalLugia> 2.0MBPS
<Luna> We pay for 3Mb/s
<HyperMetalLugia> 1.0 now
<HyperMetalLugia> GO WIRELESS z.z
<Polarfire> 0anybody here?
<HyperMetalLugia> I pay for 2MBs
<Luna> And never get even half of it
<Ghosties> 4I'm guessing the cupcakes pic will be our final pic during the interviews?
<SirSprinkles> 6We're a bit busy.
<Ghosties> 4doing stuff
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, likely.
<Flutterpeanut> OH GOD WHY WOULD I LIKE ON THAT
<Flutterpeanut> CLICK
<Flutterpeanut> *
<Luna> He got in a fight with them once
<RainBroDash> 10why did I open it again.. you guys scarred me enough as it is the first time...
<Polarfire> 0Mod business?
<SirSprinkles> 6It really shows if they know our rules.
<J-Lugia> http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384389276.png
<SirSprinkles> 6Possibly~
<prince-dari> Meh, you can always tell people R34 = kick then ben if continued, gore = ban, it's hardly that big a deal.
<Luna> Which ended in them hanging up, cutting us off the internet, and only giving it back until my mom called back to apologize
<prince-dari> ban*
<Ghosties> 4There's a lot of stuff in the picture that we don't allow or condone
<Ghosties> 4It's a good ban pic
<SirSprinkles> 6Maybe we're just ignoring you~
<Angel_Espeon> 13Screw you and your A+, J-Lugia xD
<J-Lugia> XP
<RainBroDash> 10i think dari does have a point
<J-Lugia> hey, it's all on Verizon =P
<Espeon> 06someone I know in sweden has
<Espeon> 06it's just disgusting
<Espeon> 06that's how fast it is
<Espeon> 06xD
<Hipster_Brony> 8again, this test isnt about their rules knowledge
<RainBroDash> 10but again I made sure that I had read up on the exact wording of the rules, as to be properly prepared for my interview
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384390435.png
<Hipster_Brony> 8its about their judgement
<HyperMetalLugia> Much better
<RainBroDash> 10it just made me feel more secure in my personal judgement
<Espeon> 06>better than 77% of BM
<Espeon> 06what
<Sathi> Hmm I think the same as the first picture... young users might be offended / scared and the person doing this should be informed that we do not tolerate this behaviour. Same for the movies actually in the current layout you show a warning may contain: nudity / violence / gore and so on
<HyperMetalLugia> And my upload should be 80 >.>
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Tes
<Ghosties> 4Their judgment is important, but still, there's a lot of stuff we don't allow in that pic
<prince-dari> But your judgement is different from my judgement is different from hers.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<Angel_Espeon> 13D- yay, now we're equal again
<HyperMetalLugia> BDA has BAD internet
<Ghosties> 4Bad answer
*Polarfire 0begins to doubt his very existence, spiraling into a bout of depression and self pity at the realization that the mods may be ignoring him because they don't like him.
<SirSprinkles> 6*twitch*
<Espeon> 06BDA, BAD
<Espeon> 06Punny
<Ghosties> 4She's basically saying "I'd give a little slap on the wrist"
<Espeon> 06:<
<HyperMetalLugia> Hah
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<RainBroDash> 10She's indecisive
<Flutterpeanut> Needs to be more aggressive.
<RainBroDash> 10I think
<prince-dari> Lawl, to be fair to her that's true, we show films with sex and violence in them.
<Ghosties> 4Indecisive and not nearly assertive
<RainBroDash> 10Yeah but dari we give content warnings
<RainBroDash> 10what if someone posted that during Up!
<Hipster_Brony> 8shes a bit passive
<Ghosties> 4Exactly, we let people know before hand and right before we show the movie
<prince-dari> Well she said maybe you should have content warnings on links.
<Hipster_Brony> 8but i still want to hire her
<prince-dari> That's pretty much what we do with films.
<SirSprinkles> 6She's a little passive, but I still say yes.
<Ghosties> 4Well, what do we think?
<Polarfire> 0Hello? Sathi? Anybody? D:
<Hipster_Brony> 8definite yes for me
<Ghosties> 4...She needs more training
<Ghosties> 4but sure
<Angel_Espeon> 13http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384391912.png
<Flutterpeanut> If she can be a little more assertive I'll agree. Yes.
<SirSprinkles> 6She would need training, but thats what hops are for anyway.
*Angel_Espeon happyface
<Hipster_Brony> 8so did RBD
<Ghosties> 4True
<prince-dari> I don't think she got anything major wrong, you can just tell her what to kick and ban for.
<Hipster_Brony> 8no one is completely ready
<prince-dari> So yeah.
<HyperMetalLugia> AE wins ;D
<Hipster_Brony> 8exactly dari
<J-Lugia> AE?
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, we'll just explain to her what we're looking for
<Sathi> but then again I believe you do have a mod on trial first if they get accepted? and i'm sure someone will train the new moderator what to do and what not to do. As an example; on our forum we often get questions regarding warez / software cracks and such.. these are questions we do not wish to see as the RIAA or (brein in my case) is keeping a close eye on...
<Hipster_Brony> 8any opposition to hiring her on the spot?
<Sathi> all our activies
<Luna> American Eagle
<SirSprinkles> 6I'd say on the spot.
<RainBroDash> 10I don't know about all your apparent reasons for hiring her, because I haven't read the application. So based on what I've seen I don't like it. Just the interview that is... but then I'm also comparing her to my interview too much, they were both very different
<J-Lugia> ah
<Luna> ...
<Luna> I was kidding
<HyperMetalLugia> no
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Ghosties> 4Hah, how ironic that last post was by her
<HyperMetalLugia> JL is slow!
<J-Lugia> how was I supposed to know that?
<SirSprinkles> 6...oh wow.
<RainBroDash> 10That was good
<Ghosties> 4Well, for one
<RainBroDash> 10that made me feel a lot better actually
<Ghosties> 4She's a girl
<HyperMetalLugia> You live in america?
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<J-Lugia> I don't know what your AE means, Hyper
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also, my speakers are picking up weird radio signals again
<RainBroDash> 10I don't get that
<RainBroDash> 10at all
<HyperMetalLugia> Angel Espeon
<Angel_Espeon> 13some silly opera thing
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<RainBroDash> 10'she's a girl' :S
*J-Lugia facepalms
<HyperMetalLugia> Turret Opera?
<Ghosties> 4I mean, yeah, I'm joking
<Ghosties> 4Still
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nope unforunately |D
<Ghosties> 4Different perspectives would be nice
<RainBroDash> 10alright >.<
<Angel_Espeon> 13I wish we at least picked up DECENT radio signals for a change >>
<Hipster_Brony> 8its good to have diversity in moderators to cover possible groups that could be offended
<SirSprinkles> 6So. Votes on hiring her on the spot?
<Hipster_Brony> 8but in any case
<SirSprinkles> 6I vote yes.
<Ghosties> 4Right
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes
<prince-dari> Oh just doesn't anyone want her hired on the spot? :P
<Ghosties> 4...Yes
<prince-dari> Or*
<Ghosties> 4Her actual IRL test will be the stream Friday and Saturday
<Ghosties> 4Her test run, that is
<HyperMetalLugia> We have decent radio here
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Ghosties> 4I've been saying "that is" a lot today -_-
<Polarfire> 0http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/180/1/a/pinkamina_diane_pie_by_onemansociety-d3kgh08.jpg
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, it won't be a test run, since she'll have hops.
<Flutterpeanut> Agreed.
<Hipster_Brony> 8alright, im gonna let her know
<RainBroDash> 10I don't feel like I'm in a comfortable enough position to give a definite answer yet, only an opinion. The opinion being that she needs to be shown the ropes I guess
<prince-dari> [21:46] <Ghosties> To begin, that is
<HyperMetalLugia> I think I'm the only one who listens to a certain station anymore, since the most popular has hip0hop and rap (Both ew)
<Ghosties> 4We had to show you, RBD
*Polarfire 0mumbles
<Ghosties> 4We're not just gonna say YOU'RE IN, and that's it
<Angel_Espeon> 13It disturbs me how my computer randomly picks up random radio signals in the first place >>
<Polarfire> 0so what if they don't like me... I don't need them...
<Ghosties> 4She'll be appropriately trained
<Espeon> 06signals from space
<RainBroDash> 10I know. That's why it's hard for me to make a decision. I've still been here less than a week :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8okay, after discussion with the mods, we have decided to add you as a half op
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've had french radio signals before
<Hipster_Brony> 8welcome to the team
<Polarfire> 0I can get along just fine. FINE SEE? I"M FINE!!
<Ghosties> 4But
<Polarfire> 0HAHA!
<Ghosties> 4You'll need to be trained
<Ghosties> 4Somewhat
<SirSprinkles> 6...you're not as fun as I was when I was left alone.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes
<Polarfire> 0THERE'S NOTHING WRONG HERE
<SirSprinkles> 6You're not quite strict enough on the images...
<Polarfire> 0plenty of fun, see? plenty of fun.
<Polarfire> 0always plenty of fun...
<Ghosties> 4You're not nearly assertive
<Hipster_Brony> 8really the main thing we need to train you on is the policy on R34 and gore
<Ghosties> 4But we can work on this
<Polarfire> 0see? plenty of fun.
<Sparky> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHPhxnW6Ti4 this is somehow beautiful
<ScriptBot> [1,0You0,4Tube]: William Tell Overture-Mom Style (w/ lyrics) | by animehighschoolkid | Length: | Views: 39 484
<Polarfire> 0I'll show them.
<Flutterpeanut> 13Indeed. Just a bit more assertive. Though a welcome addition.
<Polarfire> 0I just need some new friends that's all. Yes. New friends...
<SirSprinkles> 6Remember, it's better to be over assertive. A kick isn't anything that can't be recovered from.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, lets let her say something now guys XD
<Sathi> First of all thanks for the chance, I look forward to being trained further
<Ghosties> 4What the hell is wrong with Pinkie's legs?
<Ghosties> 4They're so long in that pic
<RainBroDash> 10I guess congratulations are in order then :)
<Flutterpeanut> 13*Breaks open the wine bottle*
<Sathi> *fills her glass*
<Ghosties> 4*Christens the room*
<Ghosties> 4Watch out for the glass
<Polarfire> 0http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkxsc7QWAq1qha245o1_500.png
<SirSprinkles> 6Now comes the TRULY hard part.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i also want to make sure you know a few things
<SirSprinkles> 6Picking your color.
<SirSprinkles> 6: D
*Polarfire 0mumbles
<Sparky> :'D
<Sathi> humm
<Polarfire> 0I don't need them.
<Polarfire> 0ha.
<Polarfire> 0HAHA.
*RainBroDash 10has the best colour
<Hipster_Brony> 8first of all, we need you to be reliable and available
<Ghosties> 4Definitely
<Ghosties> 4We realize that you're a Euro mod now, but prudence is very important
<Polarfire> 0They think ignoring is gonna work? Is that what they think? HAHA! I'll show them!
<Sathi> in what way?
<Hipster_Brony> 8for now, just let me go through this so we dont have any crossed wires, guys
<Polarfire> 0hehehehehehehehe
<J-Lugia> on the bright side, Angel Espeon, you'll be able to predict the oncoming allien attack =>
<Flutterpeanut> 13Personally, Me and Hipster found out skype is a very good way to contact one. If you do have a skype, or aim, or such.
<Hipster_Brony> 8we can do that later on though
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey RBD and Peanut, send emails to bronystate@gmail.com so I can put you on the mod list... because I said so.
<Sparky> hi Angel
<Sparky> ^
<Hipster_Brony> 8but basically we know that you're going to be here for the movies
<RainBroDash> 10okie dokie lokie
<Hipster_Brony> 8cuz you have been to all of them so far
<Sathi> yes, that's true
<Ghosties> 4Right, it's important that you're around for the BMNs
<Hipster_Brony> 8but we hold pretty frequent meetings throughout the week as well
<Flutterpeanut> MY GMAIL IS UNAVAILABLE
<Flutterpeanut> WADDAFU
<Ghosties> 4Hah, well that was obvious :/
<SirSprinkles> 6lawl
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Ghosties> 4Oops, sorry Hip. Go ahead
*prince-dari trolololo
<Sathi> Well I can put em in my agenda if i'm informed on time :)
<Angel_Espeon> 13Now the signals are playing some kind of Asian chanting song or something >>;
<Hipster_Brony> 8next thing, we need to make sure you know the policy on the R34 and gore
<Flutterpeanut> I'll do it later when my gmail stops being dumb
<Sparky> ...
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<Sparky> okay
<HyperMetalLugia> Hey AE
<HyperMetalLugia> Come here
<RainBroDash> 10sprinks, it's done
<Sparky> I htought it was creepy when they were playing that kind of music on a plane to Miami
<HyperMetalLugia> We're miles away from everyone else
<Sparky> but that's just weird
<Hipster_Brony> 8with those first 2 pics, those would earn a person a warning kick
<HyperMetalLugia> :)
<SirSprinkles> 6Basically, as far as the meetings go, if you're online just try to stop in here, just in case. A lot of them aren't announced ahead of time...
<HyperMetalLugia> And no radio signals from overseas either
<Hipster_Brony> 8what sprinkles said
<Hipster_Brony> 8but anyway
<Hipster_Brony> 8the 3rd pick would earn an instant ban
<Hipster_Brony> 8pic*
<Sathi> Right, that I did not know.. May I ask how this R34 started? I never heard of it before
<Hipster_Brony> 8what do you mean?
<Sathi> like I said I never have heard of rule34.. my reactions on the pictures were my personal opinion.
<Ghosties> 4Rule 34 is an internet thing
<Hipster_Brony> 8rule 34 is part of the "rules of the internet"
<Ghosties> 4Basically, if it exists there is porn of it
<Hipster_Brony> 8it means "if it exists, there is porn of it"
<Flutterpeanut> 13Rule 34 is a internet thing, basically stating that there is porn of everything. And is NSFW.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Sathi> ah
<Flutterpeanut> 13NSFW = Not Safe for Work.
<Ghosties> 4I think she gets it now
<Ghosties> 4haha
<prince-dari> You guys, repetition.
<SirSprinkles> 6This answer now comes in rainbow.
<Ghosties> 4Nah
<Hipster_Brony> 8in this context, it means pornographic pics of ponies
<Ghosties> 4We need a blue
<RainBroDash> 10lolling at explaining rule 34
<Sathi> as in ponies after dark..and such..
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, the only colors left are the two blues and the green.
<Sathi> I dont know what drives people this..
<Sathi> to*
<Hipster_Brony> 8guys, just let me go through my thing for now
<Ghosties> 4Yes...I think
<SirSprinkles> 6And the ugly purple.
<Hipster_Brony> 8and orange
<prince-dari> Our mod room is #bronystatemods - the password is trustthefungus ( so /join #bronystatemods trustthefungus ).
<Flutterpeanut> 13Pornographic images of anything is not allowed.
<Flutterpeanut> 13xD
<prince-dari> No one's using the smexy orange?
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Hipster_Brony> 8facehoof, dari
<prince-dari> I am disappoint people.
<Sathi> 7nothing wrong with orange?
<SirSprinkles> 6...well, I'd like to at least wait on the orange.
<Sathi> 7aww
<RainBroDash> 10I almost picked that :>
<prince-dari> What?
<Hipster_Brony> 8orange is fine
<Luna> Sorry J-Lugia, just whenever I see AE, I think of the clothing store, not Angel_Espeon
<Ghosties> 4But this is how it is: No matter who the viewer is, be them brand new or a regular, if they ever post anything gore or rule 34 in the chat during a stream or during off hours when a mod isn't available they will be either kicked and warned or banned
<prince-dari> You can chagne the password at any time. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, it should be waited on until after Bristle comes back.
<J-Lugia> it's fine ^^
<SirSprinkles> 6imo
<Hipster_Brony> 8eh
<Ghosties> 4*er, when a mod IS available
<Polarfire> 0They think I'm crazy...
<Polarfire> 0That's what it is...
<Hipster_Brony> 8i was just going to give it to her on friday, so we can still talk about things related to her interview here
<Polarfire> 0I'll show them.
<Ghosties> 4I just wanted to put that out there. Just elaborating on what you were saying about rule 34 and the like
<J-Lugia> I'm just trying to be more active on #SW, and as I say that my friend over here is trying to take the computer
<J-Lugia> brb
<Polarfire> 0I'll show them all.
<Polarfire> 0They'll see.
<Sparky> o3o
<RainBroDash> 10Interesting
<Polarfire> 0They'll all see.
<Sparky> lol bye
<Polarfire> 0http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lklipc5UnM1qha245o1_500.jpg
<Sathi> 7I copied that part so I can keep for myself as an reference
<Hipster_Brony> 8but anyway
<NightSeas> 12hi
<Hipster_Brony> 8lets continue
<RainBroDash> 10Ghosties, when you say rule 34, do you tend to include risque and suggestive material under that header?
<Work> 03bbs
<Hipster_Brony> 8the next thing is that we expect very professional conduct from our mods
<Ghosties> 4Yes
<Ghosties> 4If it's intentionally suggestive
<drfsupercenter> 03frick
<Hipster_Brony> 8this doesnt mean dont have fun, lord knows we love trolling the viewers
<Hipster_Brony> 8but
<Ghosties> 4Then it classifies as rule 34 in my book
<RainBroDash> 10Because you should probably use another blanket word for it
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently it's more than just the steering being out of alignment
<SirSprinkles> 6>we
<Ghosties> 4Don't know about the other mods, but it does in my book
<Sparky> this is not working
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm gonna have to pay like $280 to fix it
<Sparky> hey NS
<RainBroDash> 10well, I personally define rule 34 as porn.
<Sparky> my dog is trying to play, and I'm trying to draw
<Sparky> what are you fixing, drf?
<Sparky> car?
<NightSeas> 12derp
<Hipster_Brony> 8what i mean is stuff like not criticizing a mod in the public room
<RainBroDash> 10as in, the original 'Rules of the Internet', i.e. "34: If it exists, there is porn of it"
<Hipster_Brony> 8everything we say in the mod room stays in the mod room
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah my car
<Ghosties> 4I know what you mean, and perhaps we should include "suggestive material is grounds for kicking and bans"
<RainBroDash> 10Like, don't get me wrong, I'd not allow suggestive material in stream, just saying I'd use another way to describe what's not allwoed
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, this position can be very stressful at times
<RainBroDash> 10exactly :D
<SirSprinkles> 6And if you need to vent, do so in the mod room.
<Hipster_Brony> 8if you get frustrated or angry, make sure you vent in the mod room, not the public room
<prince-dari> Further proof that Hipster and Sprinkles are the same person.
<SirSprinkles> 6Guys... we need to post as a rainbow this week.
<SirSprinkles> 6Like, in color order.
<Sparky> I actually saw "steering" and first thought you were talking about a boat
<Sathi> 7yea that's common knowledge.. we do-not want to make a wrong impression
<Sparky> then I realized how stupid that was
<Hipster_Brony> 8exactly
<Kyu> 07so what did you break o.o
<Hipster_Brony> 8now
<J-Lugia> ok, back
<HyperMetalLugia> WB~
<Flutterpeanut> Is pink in the rainbow?
<Sparky> KYU I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING TO ME
<Flutterpeanut> I think it is
<Sparky> AND I WAS LIKE "WHA-"
<RainBroDash> 10nope :P
<J-Lugia> ty
<RainBroDash> 10it's just whiter red
<drfsupercenter> 03Kyu, the tie rods
<Hipster_Brony> 8for now, you are technically going to have the ability to ban people, but please dont
<drfsupercenter> 03or tire
<drfsupercenter> 03w/e
<drfsupercenter> 03they said I bent them
<drfsupercenter> 03to the point they can't just bend them back
<drfsupercenter> 03so the guy ordered the parts
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, it would still be in there.
<Sparky> ... the axles?
<drfsupercenter> 03not quite sure how he orders parts that will be there tomorrow
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Sparky> holy crud, drf
<Ghosties> 4A light red
<drfsupercenter> 03if the axel was bent the car wouldn't move
<Sparky> ...
<RainBroDash> 10it's not a seperate colour though
<Hipster_Brony> 8we want to give you some time to get a better feel for the rules before we turn the banhammer over to you
*Sparky facepalms
<RainBroDash> 10there's 6 colours :P
<RainBroDash> 10in the rainbow anywya
<RainBroDash> 10anyway*
<Ghosties> 4What are they?
<Sathi> 7sounds fair to me
<SirSprinkles> 6(we haven't gotten yours in the mail yet)
<Ghosties> 4Blue, purple, yellow...
<drfsupercenter> 03think about it
<drfsupercenter> 03the axel turns, right?
<drfsupercenter> 03if you bend that
<drfsupercenter> 03think of what happens
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Sathi> 7what do you mean?
<SirSprinkles> 6 7 in the rainbow
<Hipster_Brony> 8ROY G BIV
<Ghosties> 4It's a joke
<Sathi> 7ah
<Sparky> then the wheels bump
<prince-dari> Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.
<Ghosties> 4YAY, I'm first! : D
<Polarfire> 0wow you guys are pretty good at ignoring.
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<RainBroDash> 10buuut Indigo isn't a colour. it's all the church's fault :P
<drfsupercenter> 03the wheels would be moving in a circle
<drfsupercenter> 03and I mean like an up and down circle
<drfsupercenter> 03how could a car possibly drive that way
<Sparky> yeah
<Hipster_Brony> 8heres some commands you're going to use
<prince-dari> But this is best rainbow anyway.
<Sparky> they're bumping up and down
<SirSprinkles> 6We're pretty good at being busy.
<drfsupercenter> 03right
<drfsupercenter> 03basically
<Flutterpeanut> I see pink.
<Polarfire> 0oh :(
<drfsupercenter> 03the guy said I bent what I heard as tire rods
<Sparky> they would also get closer together
<drfsupercenter> 03but wikipedia suggests tie rods
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari, you need to post as that for the final post in the rainbow wall.
<RainBroDash> 10 6 was an unholy number, 7 is a righteous and holy number, social religious pressure made the inclusion of indigo necessary
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure what that is
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's some metal thing
<Sparky> uh
<Sparky> okay
<drfsupercenter> 03that has to be replaced
<Hipster_Brony> 8to kick, use "/kick [name] [kick message]"
<Luna> The wheels on th car go--*shot*
<RainBroDash> 10indigo is just blue-violet
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<SirSprinkles> 6Like, we'll do it for the start of the Brony Appreciation Day stream.
<RainBroDash> 10it's like including all the tertiary colours, like red-orange
<Ghosties> 4You know, even though I think it'll be good to have Sathi on the team I can't help but feel like she'll be a buzzkill because she doesn't get our jokes
<drfsupercenter> 03so yeah Kyu, as I had guessed, my wheels basically are shaped like / | right now
<SirSprinkles> 6Just "HAPPY BRONY APPRECIATION DAY!" in order during mute.
<Sathi> 7in an irc client cant I just click the person name kick > fill in reason?
<drfsupercenter> 03so turning it accordingly I'm driving with them like / \
<Flutterpeanut> 13Oh
<Sparky> oo
<Flutterpeanut> 13Ignore the brackets when typing it out
<Flutterpeanut> 13lol
<Sparky> haha
<Sparky> pizza
*Sparky thinks of skiing
<drfsupercenter> 03uh what
<Luna> That looks fun
<Sathi> 7I know ;)
<prince-dari> Sathi: In mibbit I think you can probably do that, yeah.
<Iskierka> the car could drive like that, sure. gangsters would love it, don't need hydraulics
<Sparky> it's what you learn when you're taught to ski
<Luna> How did you manage that?
<Sparky> the teachers are like "Do a pizza"
<Polarfire> 0well ok then
<RainBroDash> 10I checked
<Polarfire> 0http://arch.413chan.net/Pinkie_Pie_-_Super_Happy_Face-%28n1298352139653%29.jpg
<RainBroDash> 10I can't at least
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Iskierka
<drfsupercenter> 03and Luna
<Sparky> what are hydraulics?
<drfsupercenter> 03I was parked next to a lamp post
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, if you see someone you think should be banned, use "/whois" to find their hostname and post it in the mod chat
<drfsupercenter> 03without realizing it
<drfsupercenter> 03went to back out
<drfsupercenter> 03with me wheel turned
<Sparky> me
<drfsupercenter> 03and apparently the wheel hit the post and shoved the thing
<Hipster_Brony> 8usually me or sprinkles will get on it pretty quick
<Sparky> oh yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03the odd thing
<Sparky> drf
<Luna> Ahaha
<drfsupercenter> 03is that it didn't even stop moving
<drfsupercenter> 03you'd think I would be like
<drfsupercenter> 03why is the car not moving
<drfsupercenter> 03but nope
<drfsupercenter> 03it backed out fine and then broke itself
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<Sparky> It's amazing how awesome ends with me and ugly starts with u ~(˚¬˚)~
*Sparky runs
<SirSprinkles> 6Ghosties, Sathi, Hipster, DCD, Silver, RainBro, Me, Peanut, Dari with rainbow
<Sathi> 7ok
<Luna> My mom did a similar thing, except it cost her a whole door rather than tires
<prince-dari> Well I can in mIRC.
<drfsupercenter> 03nothing's wroing with my tires
<drfsupercenter> 03-i
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just the metal rods
<drfsupercenter> 03I just took it to a tire place as they have the equipment to prop the car up, etc
<Sparky> wah
<Hipster_Brony> 8"/join" is pretty self explanatory
<drfsupercenter> 03?

<Luna> Can it be bent back in shape or does it have to be replaced?
<Hipster_Brony> 8to mute the channel, use /mode #BronyState +m
<Sparky> I can't draw shoes
<Hipster_Brony> 8-m to unmute
<drfsupercenter> 03replaced
<SirSprinkles> 6...what ARE you doing?
<drfsupercenter> 03I was trying to forcibly bend it back on my own and ended up just denting the car >_>
<prince-dari> 06,04 13,07 2,08 3,09 8,12 7,13 4,06 06,04 13,07 2,08 3,09 8,12 7,13 4,06 06,04 13,07 2,08 3,09 8,12 7,13 4,06 06,04 13,07 2,08 3,09 8,12 7,13

<prince-dari> Dunno.
<drfsupercenter> 03which results in the door not being able to open
<Ghosties> 4dari being dari
<SirSprinkles> 6Though we're pretty good about doing that when necessary.
<Hipster_Brony> 8and to give someone voice, use /voice [name]
<RainBroDash> 10he's rainbow crashing the chat
<drfsupercenter> 03that's not a big deal though, my friend said all you have to do is use a suction cup to bend the metal back
<Polarfire> 0http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/58657/1689970-forever_alone_guy_painting_super.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, im done i think
<Iskierka> a big suction cup I'd think
<Flutterpeanut> 13Also, Always try to make a witty remark to the users when the channel is muted.
<Hipster_Brony> 8you guys want to add anything?
<Flutterpeanut> 13Cause it's fun
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm thinking.
<Ghosties> 4Maybe
<Sathi> 7heh yea i've seen that
*RainBroDash 10is the least witty mod
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, if you go to /whois somepony and it says they're not online, use /whowas
<Ghosties> 4Hipster pretty much covered all the bases
<Ghosties> 4But I think my parting wisdom is to have fun
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, this might be a good time to exchange contact info
<Sparky> I was thinking more along the lines of a magnet o-o
<Hipster_Brony> 8do you have skype?
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I was going to use a crowbar
*drfsupercenter hides
<drfsupercenter> 03but my friend was like no, don't do that
<SirSprinkles> 6I already added you to the mods list on the email, btw
<drfsupercenter> 03he's a mechanic, I'm trying to see if he'll help me
<Polarfire> 0You guys know what loneliness calls for?
<Ghosties> 4I know we're all mods here, and professionalism is completely key, but, having fun shouldn't be tossed out of the window
<drfsupercenter> 03as if he has the right suction cups or w/e, he prolly wouldn't charge me labor
<Sparky> lol
<Sathi> 7I do have msn / steam / googlemessenger
<drfsupercenter> 03The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) has commissioned a report that shows fair use industries play a huge part in the US economy. Fair use industries include software companies, to search engines, to news website, and not only do these industries contribute $4.5 trillion to the US economy, representing 17% of US GDP, they also employ 1 out of 8 Americans (and this is only 2009 figures).

<Iskierka> magnet probably won't work
<Iskierka> I don't think they use steel much any more
<Flutterpeanut> 13Uh. Steam works actually.
<RainBroDash> 10if it's eggs I'm going to cry
<Flutterpeanut> 13Well. for me.
<RainBroDash> 10all of us are on steam
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, you should get skype so we can use that for conferences
<Hipster_Brony> 8and actually, RBD, i need your skype too
<Polarfire> 0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
<SirSprinkles> 6You should get skype, since all the other mods have it...
<Ghosties> 4Skype is a good way to keep in contact with one another, but so is Steam
<Ghosties> 4All the mods are on Steam
*Hipster_Brony 8doesn't use steam
<Polarfire> 0I'm sorry :(
<RainBroDash> 10because of the brony movie night steam group
<drfsupercenter> 03well it's an 11 year old SUV
<Sparky> oh
<SirSprinkles> 6Steam isn't as good.
<Polarfire> 0I honestly didn't see that until it was too late rainbro
<Sparky> ...
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have it, but i only open it maybe once a week
<Sparky> drf that thing is four years younger than me
<SirSprinkles> 6Some of us can't send messages due to not having things bought.
<RainBroDash> 10I'm more likely to be signed into steam, because skype is a bitch on my limited ram
<Iskierka> might or might not be steel then
<drfsupercenter> 03Sparky is 15 now?
<Sparky> or one
<Sparky> depends on who you ask
<Iskierka> but I know they started moving over to aluminium a good while back
<drfsupercenter> 03heh
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I don't really know
<Sparky> THEN YOU MELT IT
<drfsupercenter> 03it obviously dented very easily
<Sathi> 7why not use the shared portal services microsoft offers for free?
*RainBroDash 10is crying
<Sparky> AND YOU MAKE A NEW CAR
<Sparky> OR YOU MAKE PIG IRON, EITHER ONE
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03if only it were that simple
<RainBroDash> 10erm, but if you guys want my skype i guess now is a good time: oliver.davies1992 for any mods who need it
<Sparky> that sounds like we're using that really weird aero-clay stuff that crayola sells
<SirSprinkles> 6lol shared portal services wut?
<Sparky> that I hate 'cause it hardens too fast D:
<Sathi> 7badumtish

<Flutterpeanut> 13Throw skype contacts to me. Tiga1124.

*Iskierka runs
<Sathi> 7Who will train / guide me?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's true
<RainBroDash> 10everyone i guess
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a group effort.
<Hipster_Brony> 8its mostly going to be self-trained
<Hipster_Brony> 8if you have questions, ask in the mod rom
<Hipster_Brony> 8room*
<Sathi> 7okay,somehow I cant enter the modroom now
<Sparky> no
<Sathi> 7I just tried

<Ghosties> 4And then you may go
<Sparky> and if you don't then you're an idiot
<Sathi> 7yes, one question remains. How long will this trial take?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Hipster_Brony> 8what do you mean trial?
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll be giving you hops.
<drfsupercenter> 03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/epic-fail-photos-rebate-fail.jpg
<Sparky> so naturally I hang out on sites where fans lurk
<SirSprinkles> 6Likely in a few minutes.
<Sparky> usually laughing at them
<Sparky> 'cause sometimes they're kinda stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Hipster_Brony> 8brb in about 10
<Sathi> 7No I mean before I may use the full set of tools ;)
<Sparky> ie: "OMG DAEMON SPADE IS STRAIGHT!?"
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh
<Sparky> YES HE'S STRAIGHT
<SirSprinkles> 6When we decide.
<RainBroDash> 10Ghosties I sincerely apologise as truly as one can, and I deeply wish that I never accidentally call out the wrong name when we're sharing an intimate moment ever again.
<Ghosties> 4Depends on how comfortable we are
<Hipster_Brony> 8whenever we feel like youre ready pretty much
<Sparky> YOU'VE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT HIM CREEPING ON CHROME FOR MONTHS
<Hipster_Brony> 8same deal as RBD
<Sathi> 7ok
<SirSprinkles> 6Usually doesn't take long.
<Sparky> DEAL
<Ghosties> 4...that's better. You may go now
<RainBroDash> 10<333
<Ghosties> 4I accept your apology
<Sparky> so
<Luna> o.o
<Sparky> fanfictions
<Ghosties> 4CALL ME!
<RainBroDash> 10I literally don't understand how i even did that
<Sparky> a lot of them are really really bad
<RainBroDash> 10red is red
<SirSprinkles> 6But, again, I need info for the About Us page from you, Sathi.
<Sparky> so I laugh at them
<RainBroDash> 10not purple
<Sparky> 'cause usually there's only a couple
<drfsupercenter> 03more like they're all bad
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Sparky> ...
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, brb for realz now
<Sparky> true
<RainBroDash> 10fucking sprinkles, ruining my shit
<Luna> Ahaha
<prince-dari> 6Confused?
<Sparky> but I try
<Sathi> 7Yes i'll take a look and come up with something
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<RainBroDash> 10bai guise, see you tomorrowish
<Sparky> there's quite a few that are okay
<Hipster_Brony> 8and peanut, post the link to your livestream so i can watch when i get back
<Sparky> but the majority are bad
<prince-dari> 6Look, I'm SirSprinkles!
<Sparky> and then there's the terrible ones
<Ghosties> 4Later man
<SirSprinkles> 6It's just area, favorite pony, favorite movie, and an image, Sathi.
<Sparky> anyway
<SirSprinkles> 6See ya RBD
<Sathi> 7okidoki
<Sparky> lately the quality is so terrible that I'm cringing instead of laughing at them
<Sparky> three good stories in two days
<prince-dari> [22:57] <SirSprinkles> See ya RBD | MFW you're whole minute too late
<Sparky> I hope the quality's going back up 'cause that was really awful
<SirSprinkles> 6EGGS
<Sathi> 7one question; are there any plans from your side to expand the movienights or any ideas yet to be implemented?
<SirSprinkles> 6We are planning to.
<Sathi> 7what's with the eggs O.O
<Luna> That all depends on the fans
<prince-dari> It's Bjornfot.
<Luna> Sometimes you just gotta find a few good authors and stick to them
<Sparky> 'ey
<Sathi> 7the guy that gets kicked each week?
<SirSprinkles> 6Pretty much.
<Sparky> unfortunately I can't find many of them
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, pretty much
<Ghosties> 4It may actually become a small meme
<Ghosties> 4For us, the mod
<Ghosties> 4s
<Sparky> 'cause these people seem to have an understanding of what "feelings" are that's even more elementary than mine
<Sparky> and that's saying something
<Luna> I usually only read original fiction if I'm looking at unpublished stuff, I can't really help :P
<Sathi> 7ok
<Sparky> yeeeeeeeeeeeeah
<Sparky> I'm more interested in writing the stories anyway; it's okay
<Sparky> |D
<Ghosties> 4It's Bjornfot's way of leaving his mark
<Ghosties> 4I suppose
<drfsupercenter> 03how do you do it though
<drfsupercenter> 03I can't stand to read real books, let alone fake ones
<Sparky> and the main reason I write fanfictions instead of my own is because I'm bad at creating the characters
<Luna> Do you participate it NaNoWriMo?
<Sparky> I tried
<Sparky> I had a really bad plot
<Sparky> so I gave up
<prince-dari> Pony pasta...
<prince-dari> Really?
<Sparky> 'cause it was just that terrible
<Luna> That's the fun of it though!
<Sparky> :'D
<prince-dari> Is this the only FiM produc the UK bronies get?
<prince-dari> PASTA
<Sparky> well that and I was falling behind so badly 'cause of after school stuff
<prince-dari> ARSFKLGSKLDFGLSDFGKLASDJFASLDGJKALSDFg
*prince-dari explodes.
<Luna> Oh, maybe not so much then
<Sparky> XD
<Sparky> HOLY H-
<Sparky> OH MY GOD
<Sparky> THIS PICTURE
<Sparky> IT IS GODLY
<Luna> ?
<Sathi> 7cant wait till I get my own notebook back.. it has a irc client installed and such.. currently nicked the one from my second half but he doesnt allow me to install stuff :(
<Sparky> http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=19983040

<Quanyails> 7Hmm...

<drfsupercenter> 03> when you said you hate me etc
<drfsupercenter> 03<Sparky> Isk, that is true

<drfsupercenter> 03couldn't you have just done that
<Polarfire> 0so about when can somebody be un-busy enough to chat?

<SirSprinkles> 6*uses higher res image*
<prince-dari> MFW the only Rainbow Dash toy I can buy has stupid looking hair and is out of stock.
<Quanyails> 7If you state something accusatory, people will take hostility to it.
<Sparky> it works well enough for me
<Sathi> 7ok
<HyperMetalLugia> Is sparky using a crapple?
<Sparky> ...
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Sparky> that's not the point here, HML
<Sathi> 7i'll just keep a tab open with the chat, should be on the safe side then :)
<Ghosties> 4Fucking lol at Sathi's description

<SirSprinkles> 6And then log in with "/msg nickserv identify password" whenever you come online.
<Sparky> um
<Luna> Aw, you can't get a clip of that particular scene with Zaboo
<Sparky> all I see is :D
<Sparky> so…
<Iskierka> just link episode 1
<Sathi> done
<Iskierka> since that's pretty much it
<Luna> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb7GNu3NN-E
<Luna> Was two, I think :P

<Iskierka> also yay outdated youtube script
<HyperMetalLugia> Your IRC client sucks then
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari, mind giving her her ops in here?
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew Guild
<HyperMetalLugia> What is that anyway
<prince-dari> Ok.
<HyperMetalLugia> Sounds like a Bob The Builder ripoff
<Luna> The best thing ever
<HyperMetalLugia> (The Guild of Builders)
<Quanyails> 7Brb.
<Polarfire> 0:O
<Polarfire> 0New mod?
<Sathi> sst don't tell anyone
<Polarfire> 0ok I wont :)
<HyperMetalLugia> Anyway- Legend of Neil > Guild
<HyperMetalLugia> :)
<Polarfire> 0Congratulations!
<SirSprinkles> 6>implying it matters
<Polarfire> 0 6 mods vs. one me...
<Luna> The Legend of Neil's created by the main male lead of The Guild
<Polarfire> 0FASTEST MOD GO!
<Luna> And has most of the same people working on/in it
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<Polarfire> 0lol.
<Iskierka> who's supposed to be the male lead, exactly?
<HyperMetalLugia> Well something craptastic happened inbetween~ :)
<Sathi> still fixing my macro ;)
<Luna> I'd say it's Zaboo
<Luna> At least for the first season
<SirSprinkles> 6...dat emote. XD
<Luna> Aaand second, considering he's still after Codex then
<Sathi> I like smileys :$
<Polarfire> 0Sprinkles: it soesn't matter being a mod?
<SirSprinkles> 6I just think this chat client needs better ones.
<Sathi> agreed
<SirSprinkles> 6Polar, learn to type.
<Iskierka> okay. and something craptastic between would explain how the guild is better then since it came first
<Polarfire> 0:(
<SirSprinkles> 6That wasn't even remotely understandable.
<Polarfire> 0you said >implying it matters
<HyperMetalLugia> The first is usally the worst
<HyperMetalLugia> *usually
<SirSprinkles> 6It doesn't really matter if you keep quiet about it or not, since everypony'll find out Friday.
<Polarfire> 0Oh I gotcha.
<SirSprinkles> 6Though obviously don't go off ranting for no reason.
<Luna> How can you say that if you've never watched it?
<SirSprinkles> 6Since that's... pointless.
<Polarfire> 0I won't.
<Sathi> One question; may I or may I not claim orange now?
<SirSprinkles> 6Go for it.
<HyperMetalLugia> I saw a episode
<SirSprinkles> 6Bristle's getting demodded anyway.
<Iskierka> so HML likes sequels better than originals? I think that just destroyed the value of his opinion
<SirSprinkles> 6We're just waiting for him to come back before saying anything.
<Polarfire> 0Aww man rainbro left :(
<Metal_Link> Hey! Anyone in here?
<Sathi> ah,I see
<Polarfire> 0me
<SirSprinkles> 6HOLY COW

<prince-dari> You've been kicked 49 times.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm so tired
<SirSprinkles> 6I told him we can't take him on right now if we don't know if he can be prompt.
<Sathi> 7haha

<SirSprinkles> 6I said maybe sometime down the line he can try again.

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey there
<Polarfire> 0ok ok you got it
<Sathi> 7yay
<Ghosties> 4I'm sure Polarfire will hold the number for most kicks in one day by the BMN team
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, at the time we decided to wait on it.
<SirSprinkles> 6But we need to get training new mods out of the way quickly, so we'll be giving him a trial run Friday, if I'm correct.
<Polarfire> 3HEY LOOK MODS COLORS!!! :D:D:D let's keep the record climbing.

<Espeon> 06o.o
<Polarfire> 0Or do I? DUN DUN DUUUUUUNN
<Sparky> Pretty well; you?

<Sathi> 7now.. where's my glass
<Polarfire> 0tell meh teh secrets
<SirSprinkles> 6Kicks the whole room, is what it does.
<Sathi> 7that's bad mojo
<Sparky> Got sick as in I vomited, not had a fever, btw
<SirSprinkles> 6Won't kick me though, since I have admin...
<Polarfire> 0oh. I thought it would auto kick me whenever I posted something...
<Polarfire> 0that would be cool
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02:<
<Polarfire> 0Me and 5 mods... FASTEST MOD GO AGAIN!
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I wore myself out from working so long on the comic pages that I'm exhausted every day, no matter how much I sleep.
<SirSprinkles> 6*doesn't care*
<Polarfire> 0:(
<Polarfire> 0but I'm only at 55.
<Polarfire> 0I need more.
<Polarfire> 0lol
<SirSprinkles> 6...lol we never contacted him about it, apparently.
<SirSprinkles> 6[6:39:14 PM] Hipster Brony: i was just gonna tell him when he got there on friday
<SirSprinkles> 6Hipster, you so silly.
<Polarfire> 0Hey dari is your autokick thing enabled for sending 6 messages in 10 seconds or something like that?
<prince-dari> That will ban you if you trigger it too much.
<Sparky> aaaaw
*Sparky hugs
<Ghosties> 4So he
<Sparky> yeah, those look difficult
<Sparky> ever tried black and white?
<Polarfire> 0oh.
<Ghosties> 4doesn't know that he has a test run on Friday?
<Sparky> it doesn't look as nice but it's certainly quicker
<Polarfire> 0I'll just stay away from that then.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No, because I don't know how
<Sparky> oh
<Sparky> or
<Polarfire> 0Hey where did metal go? :(
<SirSprinkles> 6*shrug*
<Sparky> sometimes what I do is that I use the shading as color
<prince-dari> The akick I know auto kicks the user when they join.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Heck, I don't even know how to make proper word bubbles .-.
<Sparky> *coloring
<SirSprinkles> 6It'll be interesting, to say the least.
<Sparky> hmm
<Sathi> 7good old IRC..
<SirSprinkles> 6He left.
<Sathi> 7how I missed thee
<Polarfire> 0do it... >:3
<Sparky> what I do is type the words on a different layer, draw the bubble around them, and then erase what gets inside the bubble
<SirSprinkles> 6I must have been thinking of something else then, dari.
<Polarfire> 0the akick I mean
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I basically do the same
<Polarfire> 0Test it out on me...
<Sparky> ah
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But since it's on GIMP I have to use my mouse instead of my pen
<Sparky> oh yeah
<Polarfire> 0but not for too long because I want to come back.

<SirSprinkles> 6TF?
<mib_c01v99> no good.
<Stormy> He was mad because he thought I was telling him what to do as a moderator instead of just a fellow member asking politely, which is what I intended
<Hooh54> 4I had a question last night to ask everybody XD
<Sathi> 7Question regarding the bans is it just on nicks or IP too?
<Sparky> Kyu, how's youre connection?
<Sparky> *your
<Ghosties> 4...we have got to watch The Wicker Man at some point

<Stormy> yeah
<SirSprinkles> 6It says it's already cleared.

<Hooh54> 4What would you think if you were drowning in Flareon floof?
<Espeon> 06And I dunno o.o
<Lambda> that's good
<Ghosties> 4But otherwise, they can just hit up our Appeal room
<Polarfire> yay
<SirSprinkles> 6TF magic.
<SirSprinkles> 6Mibbit is FAIL
<Lambda> if only the same could be said for ontels
<SirSprinkles> 6SO FAIL
<Sathi> 7no we need to watch The Rocky Horror Picture Show
<Espeon> 06Drowning implies that you can't breathe
<Espeon> 06I'm pretty sure you can breathe inside a cloud
*Espeon dies
<Lambda> honestly, I thought 36 would be the harder of the two to get to calm down
<Polarfire> I like the countdown guys :)
<Ghosties> 4If it's just a regular ban, then they can appeal
*Shiny-Growlithe yawns

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm so tired
<Metal_Link> I'm sorry, it's just I was really looking forward to this interview because the amount of trouble I went through just for this interview and. I told myself over and over that I was going to make it to this one. I wrote notes and everything. But as always something had to go wrong like me losing track of time and being an idiot. I know I shouldn't be upset.
<Metal_Link> Over a silly position but I really thought I was going to make it to this one.
<Ghosties> 4Look, Link
<Ghosties> 4PM

<Polarfire> 0*loneliness
<Ghosties> 4Sprinks, talk to him
<Ghosties> 4He's upset
<SirSprinkles> 6I already did.
<Ghosties> 4Talk to him again
<SirSprinkles> 6But I guess I'll try.
<Ghosties> 4He just emoted all over the main room
<Ghosties> 4He needs to be taken care of
<Sathi> ehmm.. how old is he?
<Ghosties> 4Don't know
<Sathi> the main room is bronystate or am I missing something?
<SirSprinkles> 6>imply age has to do with maturity
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari is 15. Oo
<Sathi> 7yes exactly
<SirSprinkles> 6And no, you didn't miss anything.
<prince-dari> Actually I'm 16 now Sprinkles.
<SirSprinkles> 6What. Evs.
<prince-dari> :P
<Sathi> 7age is just a number imo
<SirSprinkles> 6^
<Ghosties> 4Are you talking to him, Sprinks?
<SirSprinkles> 6If he would talk back.
<SirSprinkles> 6I asked if he was okay and he just went "Yes?"
<Stormy> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131052250519.jpg
<Ghosties> 4After that little explosion in the main room, I don't think he's "okay."
<Ghosties> 4But, maybe that's just my assessment
<Polarfire> 0mods are asleep...
<drfsupercenter> 03bbl, class
<Polarfire> 0what to do what to do?
<SirSprinkles> 6>implying I ever sleep
<Sathi> 7It might be me, but I do not see the explosion...
<Polarfire> 0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> That's awesome.
<SirSprinkles> 6The giant wall of text.
<HyperMetalLugia> Bai
<Sathi> 7yes *reads it again* but he explains the error is on his side? or am I reading this wrong?
<Hooh54> 4Bye
<SirSprinkles> 6It's the fact that it was in the mane room instead of in a private message.
<Ghosties> 4Exactly
*HyperMetalLugia lady gagas o.o
<Polarfire> 0I only need 2 more kicks to make it to 60 XD
<Hooh54> 4 0.0
<Ghosties> 4He wasn't tactful or discreet at all and basically plastered his complaint in the main room for all to see
<Sathi> 7ah, now I understand.. I only discovered this private message window last show.. hehe was always writing in main or via e-mail
<Polarfire> 0Can anybody do the honors?
*Quanyails 7finds it amusing when people mistype ROFL as ROLF.
<HyperMetalLugia> Poke(u)r face
<Polarfire> 0Sprinkles?
<Sathi> 7thanks for clarification
<Ghosties> 4No prob
<Sathi> 7I thought you ment a PM over oatmeal or something
<Sparky> ROLF makes me think of Rölf in The Sound of Music
<Sparky> or is that how you spell his name?
<Sparky> orz
<HyperMetalLugia> I think of the Rolf from Ed edd and eddy
<HyperMetalLugia> or whatever that insane show is
<Sparky> Ed Edd and Eddy
<Sparky> that's right
<Sparky> I like Edd
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah XD
<SirSprinkles> 6EEEEEEEEEEnope.
<HyperMetalLugia> Rolf and his goat
<Sparky> he's normal
<Sparky> ah yes, him
<SirSprinkles> 6Gog, he's being a pain.
<Polarfire> 5What about now?
<Ghosties> 4And besides, after that little show of emotion, I don't think I want him to be a mod
<Sparky> Now I remember who he is
<Ghosties> 4He's too emotional
<Polarfire> 6now I mean XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, he won't.
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<SirSprinkles> 6Neener.
<SirSprinkles> 6Neener.
<SirSprinkles> 6Neener.
<Sathi> 7or this is a good solution too
<Polarfire> 0not good for me!
<Ghosties> 4I'm saving that display
<Polarfire> 0D:
<Ghosties> 4For future reference to Hip, RBD, and the rest
*Sathi 7snickers
*Quanyails 7hmms.
<Polarfire> 0yeah yeah.
<Lambda> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm saving a log of this PM. It's just... ugh.
<Polarfire> 0you mods and your powers.
<Ghosties> 4What did he say to you?
<SirSprinkles> 6<Metal_Link>: Maybe I should of just said no to helping my father with the yard. <SirSprinkles>: Dude, it's not a big deal, things happen. <Metal_Link>: Yeah maybe I would be yelled at, cursed at, possibly thrown out of the house. But hey, at least I could of been on time.
<SirSprinkles> 6Is the last bit so far.
<Sathi> 7I was writing a wonderful warning message ..
<Ghosties> 4Man
<Ghosties> 4Pretty much what he told me
<Polarfire> 0for me? D:
<Polarfire> 0what I do?
<Sathi> 7something with colours
<Polarfire> 0oh. I just wanted to get 2 more kicks is all :)
<Ghosties> 4Saved my PM with him as well
<Ghosties> 4I don't know if I should feel sorry for the guy, or what
<Ghosties> 4On the one hand he could be telling the truth, on the other he could just be instigating drama
<Sathi> 7hmm SirSprinkles you asked about micorosft sharepoint portal.. it's a nice tool to communicate with the team. you can keep a log.. keep documents / mod instructions / set events and what not.. also it suports group messaging via msn or webbased
<Ghosties> 4I'm still here, just set my status to away for now. I'll be leaving shortly
<Polarfire> 0but it looks like nobody will help me...
<Ghosties> 4Sathi, don't tell anyone I'm still here
<Sathi> 7I won't
<Polarfire> 0So you guys know what this calls for?
<Ghosties> 4Thank you
<Sathi> 7ehmm hugs?
<Sathi> 7cupcakes?
<Polarfire> 0nope!
<Polarfire> 0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
<Sathi> 7anyone is anyone but mods right?
<Ghosties> 4Whenever we do something in the mod chat, we like to keep it private
<Ghosties> 4Don't want it up in the main room
<Polarfire> 0dari? anybody?
<Ghosties> 4As I'm sure Hipster has told you
<prince-dari> EeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeNope
<Polarfire> 0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg

<Boxxy> 3why did people start saying she died?

*Hooh54 4turns into an Espeon

<Quanyails> 7Where are you? :|
<Drake> 04Hello Quan
<Drake> 04I'm in Australia
<Quanyails> 7I mean, where have you been for the last four days?
<Drake> 04Aperape?
<Drake> 04looool
<Quanyails> 7How many times I have I poked you and you were never there?
<Drake> 04Quan
<Drake> 04Funny story

<Quanyails> 7Hmm
<Quanyails> 7?8
<Quanyails> 7?*
<Sneas> FUCKDUCK
*Sneas runs
<Drake> 04I typed '/ignore *!*@*' on NS' advice.
<Drake> 04Without realising she was joking and that that ignores everything on the goddamn server
<Drake> 04I've been wondering why everyone has been silent for four days x.x
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<Quanyails> 7Well, NS just squandered four days of question I wanted to ask. o3o
<Quanyails> 7In the singular tense.
<Drake> 04XD
<Hooh54> 4°:3
<Quanyails> 7Well, you know I'm organizing that TF2 game.
<Hooh54> 4I made an Espeon face 8I
<Quanyails> 7What time are you available? Please state time zone.
<ChaoTerra> 3NS as in Ascendant right? :3 i'm still learning these nicknames :P
*ChaoTerra 3flees
<Zashy> ha the chat works here, yay :x
<Drake> 04Time for TF2 I assume? lol
<ChaoTerra> 3hey Quan, what's with yuur addiction to TF2?
<Sathi> 7livestream chat is down?
<Quanyails> 7Addiction?
<SirSprinkles> 6lol livestream
<Quanyails> 7I'm busy trying to organize a game, yeesh. :P
<Polarfire> 0Sprinkles what should I have seen earlier :(
<Quanyails> 7Yes, Drake.
<Drake> 04It varies form day to day. In the holidays I'm usually available nearly all day (GMT+10), but on school days (which begin next week Tuesday) I'm only available in the afternoon, around 3pm-9pm
<SirSprinkles> 6Look around the site.
<Quanyails> 7Weekends?
<Polarfire> 0Does this have anything to do with the soon's?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yesh.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Lol
<ChaoTerra> 3yuu begin school next Tuesday?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So
*ChaoTerra 3went to the kitchen to get another juice box and returned with Pop Tarts :3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Think NS will like my Dorugamon? .-.
<Drake> 04Weekends is the same usually
<Polarfire> 0ok. Well lets see. There's going to be a brony appreciation day special.
<Drake> 04But I'm never sure of our plans so it will vary usually.
<Polarfire> 0There's a new mod added to the list.
<Polarfire> 0countdown got changed.
<Quanyails> 7 3PM to 9PM, GMT+10...
<Quanyails> 7So that's 5 AM to 11 AM, GMT?
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<Quanyails> 7Well, it would be best, according to other people's schedules, to be active earlier.
<Drake> 04Well I'm in school before 3pm so :P
*Shiny-Growlithe still doesn't have TF2 :D
<SirSprinkles> 6DARI WHY?
<prince-dari> For the lulz.
<Drake> 04But for the next 5 days I'm pretty much free the whole time
*ChaoTerra 3doesn't have it neither :3
<Drake> 04Minus some spriting I need to do for a friend, writing my story and doing random other things that my family asks.
<Quanyails> 7Well, I've added your possible times to the list.
<Quanyails> 7Thank you.
<SirSprinkles> 6Polar, you have to go DEEPER.
<Drake> 04That's fine
<Quanyails> 7Get it, Shiny? XD
<Quanyails> 7Ah, five days...
<TurniBrony> That's what she said
<Quanyails> 7Espeon's busy then, and I've got to figure out Rora's schedule.
<Quanyails> 7It's a bit tough when people live on all vertices of the Earth (fallacy intended).
<Drake> 04Heh
<Drake> 04I haven't play TF2 in a couple of days.
<Quanyails> 7Me neither. >>
<Drake> 04Mainly because I'm lacking motivation to do so - I really want to get this plot summary finished before the holidays end
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Quanyails> 7Well, now a community game's a motivation for you.
<Hooh54> 4Brb, drawing Espeons
<Drake> 04I've still got about 13 chapters to go but LOL
<Drake> 04Yeah it is
<SirSprinkles> 6And dari, I believe you mean "For the enjoyment I anticipated after performing said activity"
<prince-dari> Nope, for the lulz.
*prince-dari trollface.
<Drake> 04Games are always more fun when you play with friends - that's my main problem with ignoring Halo:Reach for several weeks.
<Aristeo> rawr
<Charles> meow
<Quanyails> 7Indeed.
<ChaoTerra> 3plot summary? about what?
<Drake> 04My fanfic.
<SirSprinkles> 6: D
<Drake> 04Once I finish it I'll move onto writing.
<ChaoTerra> 3ooooooh~~ fanfiction
<SirSprinkles> 6I am currently resisting the urge to troll harder.
<ChaoTerra> 3i can never finish a story
*Aristeo hugs Charles
<ChaoTerra> 3i always start writing with a good idea
<prince-dari> You couldn't troll harder if you wanted to.
<Charles> :D
<ChaoTerra> 3and never get past chapter 2 :/
<Drake> 04That has happened to me several times.
*Charles hugs Aristeo back
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, but I could.
<SirSprinkles> 6I just won't.
<Drake> 04Which is why I decided to accept May's offer of collaboration in order to motivate me to finish it.
<Flutterpeanut> 13I can troll if I wanted to
<Flutterpeanut> 13=D
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Why would I Quan?
<ChaoTerra> 3well, how do yuu motivate yuurself to continue?
<prince-dari> Why u no troll?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I don't know if I like it, or if it would run on my computer
<SirSprinkles> 6You can troll if you want to~
<SirSprinkles> 6You can leave your friends behind~
<Drake> 04By giving myself a time limit.
<ChaoTerra> 3i definately can't
<prince-dari> No troll?
<Sneas> z
<prince-dari> RAGE QUIT TILL TOMORROW
<Drake> 04I definately find that I can write more easily when I'm moving - like when I'm sitting in a car for example.
<Charles> how ya doing Ari?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02o3o
<Drake> 04Only problem is the laptop runs out of battery very quickly.
<ChaoTerra> 3i have no schedule for Quany to write down. i go on the computer when my parents give me permission or when they're not here
<SilverSonic> o3o
*SilverSonic tackle huggles Shi-Shi
<SilverSonic> :3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02When you're moving it's like you're pacing
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Droif
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So basically ideas are running freely in your head
<Drake> 04Exactly Shiny
<Drake> 04I mean
*Shiny-Growlithe hugs back
<SilverSonic> X3
<Drake> 04I finished the summaries of two chapters yesterday while I was in Dad's ute before the battery died.
<ChaoTerra> 3Drake, have you tried lowering your screen brightness
<Drake> 04I reckon I could have almost finished it if it lasted longer.
<Drake> 04Chao, with power saver on, brightness down lowest, my laptop only lasts about an hour and a half.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You know what that means?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02ROAD TRIP
<ChaoTerra> 3that's why i did to my laptop so it can go about 5-7 hours
<ChaoTerra> 3lawl
<Drake> 04lol
<Drake> 04My laptop is a 'gaming laptop'
<ChaoTerra> 3wow, that's one horrible battery
*ChaoTerra 3flees
<Drake> 04It's meant to be treated like a desktop
<Drake> 04IKR
<Drake> 04If I had known that I would've just gotten a desktop.
<Sparky> HI SHINY
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02HI SPARKY
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02http://oi55.tinypic.com/25rcf20.jpg how's this looking btw?
<drf-Droid> LOL, my laptops battery only lasts an hour and a half too
<ChaoTerra> 3someone maid a horrible prank call
<drf-Droid> but it's basically a portable powerhouse desktop
<Drake> 04holy crap shin
<ChaoTerra> 3*made
<Drake> 04Shiny*
<Drake> 04That's epic
<Drake> 04drf My laptop sucks.
<ChaoTerra> 3yes, yes it does
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Mine lasts 20 minutes on its own :D
<Drake> 04I don't even know why it's called a gaming laptop. It can only just run Spore on full graphics.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So it's always charging
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Btw, thanks Lyon
<drf-Droid> well mine actually works for gaming on high settings
<Drake> 04No prob Shiny. Only reporting truths

<CaitSith> o.o
<Ascendant> waitwhat?
<Espeon> 06Joined your session, couldn't blow up the snipers quick enough when I was demo though :<
<Drake> 04Maybe that's why I got the achievement "Quadruple Stack"
<Drake> 04That's fine
<Drake> 04I don't know which Medigun is better though
<SilverSonic> xD i forgot to change that
<Espeon> 06quadruple bypass or stack?
<Drake> 04The original one, or the one i have now - it doesn't let me overheal, but I get 25% extra ubercharge speed and I increase attack power instead of giving invicibility
<Drake> 04I believe it was stack
<Drake> 04I'll check tomorrow
<Espeon> 06The quickfix is very good for a field medic constantly healing everyone to full health
<Espeon> 06Medigun and Kritz is better for stuff like hanging onto a heavy
<Espeon> 06it's all situational
<Drake> 04ah

<Sparky> and my gosh it sounds so much better as an real recording
<Sparky> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP1457WwIL4 this is what I've been listening to
<Sparky> t
<ScriptBot> [1,0You0,4Tube]: 合唱『only my railgun』ってみた 【4+1 chorus】 | by isoock | Length: | Views: 658 469
<Sparky> there's questionable scenes during the guitar solo though
<Sparky> I love how the length did not show up there
<drf-Droid> it never does
<drf-Droid> and meh
<Sparky> |D
<drf-Droid> audio is so horrible quality over 3G
<drf-Droid> that I can't even tell
<Sparky> (What's with your voice? I can't freaking tell; you sound li-)
*Sparky stops now
<drf-Droid> also I think the whole railgun thing is an innuendo :P
<Sparky> really?
<Sparky> why?
<drf-Droid> rule number 1, everything good in life is suggestive
*drf-Droid hides
<Sparky> uh
<Sparky> ?
<Sparky> it's a huge lightning bolt
<Sparky> ._.
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Sparky> well that's not exactly true
<Sparky> "Misaka's nickname, 'Railgun', comes from her ability to fire metal objects at incredible speeds using electricity."
<Ray||Touhou> 02FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

<Sparky> wait no I think it was against either Youmu or Yuyuko
<Sakuya> Touhou, I could play that :D
<Sparky> but point being

<drf-Droid> yep
*Ray||Touhou RAAAGEEEESSS
<drf-Droid> I have my Zune on shuffle
*Ray||Touhou RAGE-plays again
<drf-Droid> I love that my class has a lunch break
<drf-Droid> ^ see, look what touhou does to people
<drf-Droid> makes them into raging lunatics
<drf-Droid> and this is why I won't touch it
<Sparky> "To Touma, as she was having lunch with the Kamijou Family " <-- thought of the wrong Kamijou-kun lol
<drf-Droid> o.o
<Sakuya> Then don't touch it, but dont call us lunatics
<drf-Droid> I wasn't
*Sparky throws a brick at drf
*Sparky follows this with a half-full glass of orange juice
*Sparky and a vending machine for good measure
<drf-Droid> LOL
<drf-Droid> how can a rat pick up a vending machine
<Sakuya> You just said playing touhou turns us into lunatics
<drf-Droid> doesn't mean that's a long term effect
<Sakuya> Lol what
<drf-Droid> don't feel like explaining
<drf-Droid> but it clearly brings out your anger when you play it
<drf-Droid> which is usually not good
<drf-Droid> brb
<Sparky> Lunatic Mode:
<Sparky> Not for anyone
<Sparky> Drf
<Sparky> drf
<Sparky> so
<Sparky> can I explain something to you
<Sparky> that will probably be make you laugh at me but oh well
<Sparky> so my brother needs some new clothes
<Sakuya> Yeah lunatic mode....is intense
<Sparky> so he, my mother, and I all went to a mall
<Sparky> also to grab lunch at Boudin's
<Sparky> but anyway
<Sparky> they're looking around at clothes that he can wear
<TurniBrony> What's the matter Peanut? Can't get out of your shell?
<Sparky> I'm looking around for clothes that I can draw |D
<TurniBrony> I should write this down.
<drf-Droid> uh
<drf-Droid> you want to explain something?
<Sparky> ....
<Sparky> did I say explain
<Sparky> lol
<Sparky> well
<Sparky> 1) I have no fashion sense
<Sakuya> This is either a long story, or I'm not sure why she's talking to you
<Sparky> I'm not good at explaining things
<Sparky> it's actually part of my homework
<Sparky> explain things
<Flutterpeanut> NOPE
<drf-Droid> she just said "drf can I explain something to you"
<drf-Droid> so o.o
<Sparky> another part is to diagree with people o3o''
<drf-Droid> I love disagreeing with people
<drf-Droid> :D
<Sparky> which I'm not doing well
<TurniBrony> Well. Dari has it logged. So it can be admired... FOREEEVEEEER
<Sparky> I don't :D
<Sakuya> Duh
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Sparky> which is why it's my homework OLT
<Sparky> but anyway
<Sparky> 2) all people I draw end up looking… honestly really really weird
<Sparky> 'cause nobody dresses like I do
<Sparky> ...
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Sparky> 'cause nobody dresses like I do and looks okay
<Sparky> 'cause
<drf-Droid> who said you look okay
*drf-Droid hides
<Sparky> o3o
<Sparky> o3o'''
<Sathi> 7Hmm where have I heard this FOREEEVEEEEER before
<drf-Droid> you KNOW I hate that face :|
