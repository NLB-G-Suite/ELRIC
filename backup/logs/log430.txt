<drfsupercenter> 03but
<SlurryMoon> 3heheh, SlurryMom is
<drfsupercenter> 03Def Jam Rapstar
<Tovler> I was not prepared for Luigi's high-pitched voice.
<Troll> haha
<Aurora> 6never heard of it
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like a Rock Band type game in which you rap along to songs
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<NightSeas> 02lmao
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<fapplebloom> Shamroc: i highly doubt that's true but ok
<drfsupercenter> 03the songs are stored as instrumental+acapella
<Shamroc> NOSTALGIA!
<NightSeas> 02never heard of it either
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tell your mom I said hi.
<drfsupercenter> 03>Rare rap instrumentals
<DairyCannon> Nittany_Discord his mom :)
<Aurora> 6ah

<LunaTheBeloved> ikr
<otakon> SlurryMoon: your lucky you've got a mom that plays vidya games with ya!
<DairyCannon> lol ninja
<Shamroc> fapplebloom..ask SlurryMoon then
<Reikim> FlareChaser: Ah, but can you block an ARMOUR-PIERCING SNIPER ROUND?! http://static3.fjcdn.com/thumbnails/comments/Fluttershy+_82bd7a4e303e21d52e433b6f94cdc123.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03they had all 3 versions, Xbox 360/Wii/PS3 for $1
<FlareChaser> Its just me, TheHoodyNinja, and Reikim.....
<Twi_Fi> http://derpy.me/EGJcS
<imjustaderper> otakon: ikr
<drfsupercenter> 03so I got the 360/PS3 as ew Wii, that's not going to help get good quality rips at all
<FlareChaser> Reikim: You just sent me to Funnyjunk.
<CupcakeWarrior> SlurryMoon: The fact that your mom gave birth to you instantly makes her awesome
<imjustaderper> LIKE A BOSS
<Shamroc> I DONT EVEN REMEBER OWNING THIS...but im still hit by nostalgia
<drfsupercenter> 03but if you go into practice mode, you can just say "vocals off" and play the entire song instrumental. xD
<Reikim> FalreChaser: What? I...what?
<fapplebloom> Shamroc: fictional characters cannot have corporeal children
<NightSeas> 02EW wii version of a PS3/xBox game
<drfsupercenter> 03Exactly
<scootminer> gotta do my homework D:
<drfsupercenter> 03Rock Band was fun on the Wii, but only because of homebrew
<drfsupercenter> 03that lets you add custom songs
<Twi_Fi> I think funnyjunk is an unreliable site to link from.
<LunaTheBeloved> i still own it
<SunderlandPony89> Good luck with that scootminer
<drfsupercenter> 03in terms of audio quality it's terrible
<Twi_Fi> Tends to link just to homepage.
<fapplebloom> homework is overrated
<Reikim> FlareChaser: Damn, sorry 'bout that
<Shamroc> .....question fapplebloom if he is fictonal and therefore not real..how is this being played streamed and how is he typeing?
<fapplebloom> just drop out
<Troll> Bowl over
<Everlasting_Joy> fapplebloom Agreed.
<NightSeas> 02Didn't know the wii had bad audio quality too
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the thing
<Derpy_Hooves> I LOVE THIS MINGAME
<drfsupercenter> 03I think it can output CD-quality (as in, 44.1kHz)
<RustyMeat> FAP FAP FAP
<drfsupercenter> 03but nobody does it
<Twi_Fi> no
<drfsupercenter> 03even games lik Brawl
<drfsupercenter> 03are 32kHz
<RAWRity> Hmm. I need to find something super happy to get my mind off of this. Who'd have thought a visual novel would have managed to bug me out this much?
<drfsupercenter> 03which sounds terrible on a computer
<imjustaderper> 10x9=90
<Twi_Fi> dat math
<SlurryMoon> 3oh gog...
<FlareChaser> http://johnjoseco.deviantart.com/art/Good-Morning-Colgate-282718720 Brushing powers! ACTIVATE!
<fapplebloom> Shamroc: ...then he is a real person masquerading as a fictional woman's offspring?
<SlurryMoon> 3Diod you see that? o.o
<Randall1160> THE CHAMP IS HERE
<Randall1160> THE CHAMP IS HERE AFTER A VERY LONG LEAVE, BEEN EXTREMELY BUSY
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01fapplebloom: It's a bit late for me. I graduated.
<drfsupercenter> 03so Rock Band was originally CD quality on Xbox 360/PS3 (literally the EXACT SAME files, as I said) and then they made it crap for Wii
<DairyCannon> slick
<Everlasting_Joy> Donkey Kong isn't happy.
<Alister> Reikim : I found a solution http://browse.deviantart.com/?q=nightmare%20moon&order=9&offset=120#/d4t0hp3

<drfsupercenter> 03until the 3DS is hacked I'll have no way of knowing what sampling rate it is
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I need to optimize a very slow program.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm going to bet it's not 44.1
<Alister> Back
<LunaTheBeloved> N64 was, imo, the greatest console Nintendo put out
<NightSeas> 02LOL probably not
<Shamroc> fapplebloom...i think you need contacts or glasses
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: visual novel called "Katawa Shoujo". Played it yesterday, and there are some parts that kind of...got to me.
<Troll> Ewww
<FlareChaser> Reikim: Can your pony.... dissapear? http://flarechaser.deviantart.com/favourites/#/d468y5g
<DairyCannon> Nittany_Discord what language?
<drfsupercenter> 03since you're more of an artsy person I'll explain it like this: sampling rate is to audio as pixel depth (or rather, the amount of "bits" in an image) is to images
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01C.
<SuperSaxyMaid64> 11,02http://macromeme.com/cat/diglet-tooth-wut.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03like, difference between an 8-bit bitmap and a 24-bit one
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<SunderlandPony89> RAWRity: I've heard of that actually, been meaning to check it out
<CupcakeWarrior> It also had the best controller
<drfsupercenter> 03CDs are 44.1kHz, DVDs are 48

<drfsupercenter> 03for blank ones, yeah
<LunaTheBeloved> *minigame
<drfsupercenter> 03to produce? Who knows
<RAWRity> SunderlandPony89: well, it IS an indipendent game, and each story path is a good 8 hours, so It's not surprising it took so long.
<drfsupercenter> 03Sony is stupid like that
*LunaTheBeloved hugs Shamroc
*SuperSaxyMaid64 huggles LunaTheBeloved back :3
<imjustaderper> anypony else know that if you pres sthe arrows up and down on your keybord you can see your previous comments
<fapplebloom> oh god i loved this minigame
<Reikim> Dken2021: We're having an image war, because. We're looking at different categories.
<Litwick> WTF is with Dk's face
<fapplebloom> so many memories
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: you would be correct.
<Everlasting_Joy> Why does DK have to be the victim of the face lift?
<SunderlandPony89> RAWRity: DAMN man, 8 hours?! I thought it would be much shorter!
<LunaTheBeloved> I really wanna play some Donkey Kong 64 now.....
<drfsupercenter> 03that's one reason I wanted HD-DVD to win the format war, it was an open format
<Shamroc> ...thanks...even thou you wanted to sacrafise me not more then 5 minutes ago
<NightSeas> 02and the fanboys are even dumber
*NightSeas runs
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: Rin's good ending actually made me cry

<imjustaderper> Everlasting_Joy: cause he kidnapped princes speach before,heres his punishment
<drfsupercenter> 03Blu-Ray on the other hand, Sony makes royalties off of every one sold, regardless of what brand/movie studio is it

<SlurryMoon> 3yay~
<Reikim> RAWRity: Which VN are you playing?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm it's been a long time since i played that and it was indeed sad
<drfsupercenter> 03one reason why Xbox 360 will never have Blu-Ray support
<imjustaderper> anypony else know that if you pres sthe arrows up and down on your keybord you can see your previous comments
<drfsupercenter> 03Microsoft isn't going to just give money to Sony LOL
<LunaTheBeloved> Hey, I said save the Chicken
<Troll> Grats grats
<RAWRity> SunderlandPony89: and that's just for ONE path. There's a total of 5 paths, with good and bad (and sometimes neutral) endings.
<RAWRity> it's LONG
*SunderlandPony89 is reminded of his days playing Mario Party 4, and all the frustrations he had while playing

<FlareChaser> WHY IS EVERYONE SAYING MY NAME? What...
<drfsupercenter> 03Why? So that Nintendo doesn't have to pay to use the DVD trademark
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>|
<scootminer> flarechaser:
<MahBoi777> FlareChaser:
<drfsupercenter> 03but format wise they're the same thing
*Nittany_Discord 11,01gives SlurryMoon a star.
<FlareChaser> D:
<SunderlandPony89> FlareChaser FlareChaser FlareChaser
<NightSeas> 02Nintendo like to make their own stuff .-.
<Alister> Look at the link FlareChaser
<fapplebloom> FlareChaser: i was just going along with the crowd

<FlareChaser> Alister: I did, awesome.
<LunaTheBeloved> *Go
<drfsupercenter> 03they just steal the technology and rename it
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<RAWRity> otakon: that's the game's name, Katawa Shoujo.
<SlurryMoon> 3nooooo ;n;
<CupcakeWarrior> Honestly, the only bad thing about Katawa is that you have sex with disabled girls
<NightSeas> 02LOL true
<SlurryMoon> 3Mommy died :<
<Reikim> FlareChaser: What were we doing again?
<CupcakeWarrior> And thats gross
<DairyCannon> :(
<drfsupercenter> 03DVDs are different from Blu-Rays in that nobody collects royalties
<otakon> RAWRity: and once again what?
<LunaTheBeloved> Nuuuuuu
<imjustaderper> Flarechaser is hearign ding dign
<Shamroc> LunaTheBeloved..who do you play charcter wise on all the mario games?
<SlurryMoon> 3or at least lost all her coins >>
<drfsupercenter> 03But, in order to call something a "DVD", technically, you have to pay to use the trademark
<imjustaderper> hi FlareChaser
<FlareChaser> Reikim: ummm Catorgories.
<drfsupercenter> 03as the DVD logo has a little ® after it
<imjustaderper> hi FlareChaser
<LunaTheBeloved> Yoshi
<drfsupercenter> 03so Nintendo was like "OK, let's just not call them DVDs"
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>

<LunaTheBeloved> yeah
<FlareChaser> Alister: lol
<SlurryMoon> 3Mother is Peach
<otakon> I knew it WEE GEE!
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: Wasnt that game made by 4channers?
<drfsupercenter> 03which is probably the main reason the Wii can't play DVD videos
<RAWRity> otakon: Katawa Shoujo. Translates roughly "Cripple Girl"
<Shamroc> i do dry-bones when able..
<Everlasting_Joy> Gotcha, thank you.
<drfsupercenter> 03or else they'd be sued for using the format without paying
<drfsupercenter> 03there are Japanese ones that can play DVDs, but they cost more obviously :P
<NightSeas> 02yeah
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> waluigi
<Reikim> Alister: We're doing an image showdown, and we need a category. I'm Fluttershy, FlareChaser is Colgate. Suggestions?
<DairyCannon> Silly Peach :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SlurryMom, why you go in circles?
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: yes, actually. And I was surprised that it wasn't offensive in the least.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> in this one luigi
<drfsupercenter> 03(Whereas if you hack your Wii it can play DVDs just fine, albeit really crappy quality because LOL GAMECUBE HARDWARE)
<CupcakeWarrior> Ikr

<SunderlandPony89> RAWRity: That's... interesting. And unsurprising.
<RAWRity> otakon: CupcakeWarrior I believe they also have a setting where you'll be able to turn off the 18+ stuff.
<drfsupercenter> 03it'll output them at 480
<tetra> colgate is good toothpaste
<drfsupercenter> 03which looks terrible on my TV

<tetra> no im switching beetween laptop and desktops often
<WallDives> RAWRity: same with Misha.
*LunaTheBeloved uses knife on net
<WallDives> And Ibarazaki.

<Shamroc> LunaTheBeloved..why wont you belive me!

<DaringDude> i got this great pinkie pie but i have yet to put the finishing touches on
<Reikim> otakon: Okay what the hell
<RAWRity> Friend of mine had a track coach in high school who would constantly yell at the runners. Eventually "Dammit, get your head in the game!" became a running joke for us.
<otakon> I wonder how Absolute Balance it coming along
<SunderlandPony89> Reikim: I got that too
<LunaTheBeloved> I do...
<NightSeas> 02Back then was when developers were being the laziest towards the ps3
<LunaTheBeloved> I said "Of course you were" and "Mhmm"
<tetra> i think im good at pinkie pies voice i could make good impressions
<NightSeas> 02which is why you say Beautiful Katamari looks better on xBox
<Reikim> otakon: I think my computer is acting up
<LunaTheBeloved> RAWRity, Booooooo
<fapplebloom> so this one time i had a nightmare where pinkie pie molested me
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean like how older DVDs look better than newer ones because they weren't intentionally making crappy transfers on DVDs in order to make people want Blu-Rays? :P
<otakon> tetra: record a bit on soundcloud and give us the link
<SunderlandPony89> RAWRity: I c wat u did thar
<Reikim> otakon: THIS is the site for the MLP dating sim http://www.gentlecolts.org/

<sub06905> watch sum archer!
<RAWRity> also, gotta say. I still kind of want to punch Misha in the face when she talks.
<Polydunami> Whahaha!

<LunaTheBeloved> Black woman says sit down, you sit down

<Lopy> lol
<IshBestPony> Is that the dude?
<Midnight_Tempest> Mutterguy: because im an evil canadian... and yes, they do exist
<RAWRity> WallDives: unless Misha turns out to be a guy in the end, I don't think that fits.

<Midnight_Tempest> the changling queen is my waifu ^__^
<Shizuka> 13if your illness is cured, it means you did it through will alone, not by the drug

<Polydunami> So no more unfoundbug?
<junh1024-XD> you know \how it looks like?
<Midnight_Tempest> Placebo's... pretty much every drug out there is a placebo
<CupcakeWarrior> Hey RAWRity, you said a few days ago that you would think about shipping me with Lyra
<RAWRity> it's what they use when testing drugs, to see if it's actually effective, or just makes people think they're better.
<Aurora> 6vaguely
<Polydunami> And some do a bit of harm to your body
<Aurora> 6I just couldn't remember how he did the T
<Aurora> 6and I just did it
<pegasiss666> hi twilight

<Shizuka> 13it's a 15 minute vid
<M1DNY73> oh gosh no
<RAWRity> so as i understand it, part of getting Emi's route in this is to give yourself a heartattack.

<CupcakeWarrior> http://macromeme.com/dog/fight-club-rule-1.html
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I think

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Liek
<SuperBrony64> 11,02our intermission video should be an hour long

<Shizuka> 13exactly rawrity <3
*Chrysalis gives SuperBrony64 a.... GREAT BUG HUG
<Chrysalis> Big*
*Midnight_Tempest glomps SuperBrony64
<RAWRity> Polydunami: you don't pull of Tsundere well.
*SuperBrony64 hugs Chrysalis and Midnight_Tempest back
<Midnight_Tempest> yay!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02All the hugs ^-^
<Polydunami> Who?
<RAWRity> i think meanwhile would be a good Tsundere character
<WallDives> Polydunami: Tsundere, like the character trait?
<pegasiss666> rly cows
<M1DNY73> pony control panel
<Shizuka> 13n-not that Polydunami WANTED to pull off tsundere well
<Polydunami> Yeah I know. Just trying to save face :$
<Midnight_Tempest> Tsundere is a person that acts all tough on the outside but is a big softy inside
<pegasiss666> ewww
<RAWRity> Polydunami: basically a character archetype that likes somebody, and acts like a dick to them to hid it."
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't do the D and F in my name in cursive
<drfsupercenter> 03just print XD
<RAWRity> think Helga from Hey Arnold

<Midnight_Tempest> lol
<WallDives> RAWRity beat me to it.
<DrGNs> I need to lie down for the night, I'll talk to you all tomorrow.
<pegasiss666> NOOOO

<Chrysalis> Shizuka as in Neon Genesis asuka?
<pegasiss666> BUILDINGS ARE LIVING
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity if i get choosed do i get to see the game simulator before it comes out ?
<Aurora> 6ew cursive Ds
<Shizuka> 13next year i believe

<Shizuka> 13or was this fall
<Aurora> 6mine is half cursive, half print
<Shizuka> 13i forget..
<Polydunami> Fine. Don't give me the tsundere personality. See if I care
<Shizuka> 13^ X3
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: even better, you get to MAKE IT :D
<Aurora> 6I hate that little loop on the bottom left
*RAWRity can't wait for them to bring over the new Berserk movie
<pegasiss666> is the wall evryone that died?
<WallDives> we cant tell otakon about it though. it'll be a surprise.
<Polydunami> Actually, PLEASE don't make me a tsundere... Please?
<Midnight_Tempest> Eva 3.0 is out this fall
<Chrysalis> RAWRity i could give a hand at making it once this courseworks over
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity xD
<Shizuka> 13yay~
<WallDives> also, to get Meanwhile's route, you have to do something with Trixie.
<Shizuka> 13that means the dvd will be out in 2014 >>
<M1DNY73> you guys have all lost me :P
<RAWRity> Polydunami: don't worry, Meanwhile will be the Tsundere
<pegasiss666> fluttershy is so moe
<Polydunami> That's a better tsundere by far
<Chrysalis> RAWRity and locked to always be with trixie?
<RAWRity> Shizuka: what, was it licensed by Viz? those fuckers take forever.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Silk worms actually have their salivary glands replaced with the silk glands so their silk fibers are produced near their mouth.
<Chrysalis> hang on... if all the targets are bronies... is the charachter a female?
<ponyloverforeva> :|
<pegasiss666> which one of the mane six would b tsundere?
<Shizuka> 13funimation
<WallDives> pegasiss666: probably Rarity.
<drfsupercenter> 03of what, D?
<RAWRity> oh, yeah, I heard that the Paradise Kiss manga is getting rescued. neat.
<RAWRity> Rainbow Dash would be the Tsundere type, I think.
<pegasiss666> id think rd
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Polydunami> pegasiss666: Hmm... I would probably say Rainbow Dash
<Midnight_Tempest> funimation takes pretty long to release things too...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka's name starts with the letter S.
<RAWRity> just look at how she responds to books.
<Aurora> 6and F is just a horrible cursive letter
<Polydunami> SuperBrony64: NAWWWWW
<Midnight_Tempest> SuperBrony64: NO WAY!
<Aurora> 6you knwo what cursive letter is fun
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Chrysalis nope you will be the gay option /joke
<Aurora> 6capital Z
<CupcakeWarrior> SuperBrony64: I thought her name was Zhisuka

<pegasiss666> its a tundra
<RAWRity> oh man...Accel World's been pre-licensed by Viz. Guess I'll put that on my 2015 christmas list...
<Shizuka> 13it does?
<Polydunami> Well too bad, I got three legs to stand on
<Aurora> 6doesn't look like a Z, I hate cursive in general, but it's so fun
<Shizuka> 13well how bout that
<drfsupercenter> 03it looks like a 2
<MahBoi777> lol
<Aurora> 6ikr

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I start with the letter *Explodes*
<Aurora> 6xD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity question humans or ponies simulator?
<Aurora> 6stupid requirements to learn it

<drfsupercenter> 03"You'll need it in high school" Um, no you won't
<Aurora> 6and as pretty as it's supposed to look, NO ONE writes like that
<Midnight_Tempest> lol
<Chrysalis> TheGreatAndPowerfulT there are several questions for this game which worry me
<Aurora> 6my cursive is just.....
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Either or. you can choose either
<Chrysalis> that is one of them
<SuperBrony64> 11,02If I could rearrange the alphabet...
<Polydunami> Polydunami starts with the letter pie
*XAX is back from karate. "Hello everypony" :>
<Chrysalis> RAWRity, male or female
<Aurora> 6you look at it, your eyes burn out of their sockets
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dat scares me
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'd be God :I
<RAWRity> Chrysalis: either or, again you can choose.
<Chrysalis> o.0
<somepony_else> hi XAX
<Polydunami> Oh hey XAX :3

<MahBoi777> wb XAX
<Chrysalis> man there is going to be ALOT of routes in that game
<Twi_Fi> wb XAX.
<junh1024-XD> i used to do a signature of my initials, now it's my full name in scribbles
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Game?

<Aurora> 6same
<Aurora> 6scribble signatures ftw
<Polydunami> Let me rephrase that. HIYAAAH XAX!
<Midnight_Tempest> RAWRity, that is a lie... i only like the ladies...
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: joking about making a Bronystate dating sim
<Chrysalis> RAWRity awww joking?
<RAWRity> Midnight_Tempest: not in this game you don't
<Chrysalis> that would of been amusing
<XAX> Such enthusiasm, Polydunami :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<RAWRity> Chrysalis: I have nowhere near the skill or determination to make this for real.
<CupcakeWarrior> Nittany exploding would be a loading screen or something
<Chrysalis> we could make otakon the default route
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Someone might go out and make it real.
<Midnight_Tempest> RAWRity: well im not in that game... am I? HOW DID I GET IN THAT GAME!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity well you can make Midnight_Tempest the one who is in denial
<WallDives> Chrysalis: otakon is the playable character.
<Midnight_Tempest> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: that would be Meanwhile... you know he loves Trixie XD
<Aurora> 6NOOOO
<Chrysalis> WallDives i like that solution
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Midnight_Tempest about his sexuality
<Aurora> 6I need to be in bed hahaha
<drfsupercenter> 03so do I but I'm not tired
<drfsupercenter> 03as usual
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Midnight_Tempest we already know he is in denial about trixie
*CupcakeWarrior wants to be in the dating sim
<Aurora> 6I could just not go to class tomorrow
<RAWRity> Midnight_Tempest's route eventually leads to him admitting he's attracted to otakon, and then share a passionate night in a field of fireflies and sunflowers. Then, as the morning sun peeks over the horizon, they spend several minutes just staring into one another's eyes.
<CupcakeWarrior> http://macromeme.com/dog/studying-test-troll.html
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what I did today
<drfsupercenter> 03XD

<RAWRity> They don't neet to say anything because...it's already been said.
<Aurora> 6if I didn't show up, she'd be like "oh, are your animations going ok?"
<junh1024-XD> to all nighter or not all nighter
<Aurora> 6sure, animating, that's wat I was doing.
<junh1024-XD> that is the question
<drfsupercenter> 03"This is midterm week... did our teacher announce the midterm? What if it's tomorrow?"
<RAWRity> /Good End
<Midnight_Tempest> RAWRity: for the love of... HAVE YOU BEEN READING MY DIARY! <_< >_> uh... never mind that... .////.
<Aurora> 6all nighters are ok unless class is the next day

<Aurora> 6that just sucks.
<drfsupercenter> 03yep.
<Midnight_Tempest> all the frames?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what I ran into yesterday
<drfsupercenter> 03hence sleeping until 7 today :P
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: Yes, but you will have the option to turn them off
<Aurora> 6if you make it throgh that, you're good

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity and what's my route, story thingy ?
<drfsupercenter> 03I made it through that
<RAWRity> apparently, Peter Jackon's filming it at 48 FPS. This has had the unfortunate side-effect of making the sets look like shit in the final product.
<drfsupercenter> 03gbut I know what you mean
<drfsupercenter> 03-g
<Twi_Fi> Midnight_Tempest, it is?
<drfsupercenter> 03and then when I was done with class around noon, I was liek "Why am I not tired, I should actually sleep now"

<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Haven't thought of it yet.
<Midnight_Tempest> Twi_Fi: nope, this is my basement and you're my prisoner ^__^
<Twi_Fi> :O
<Polydunami> The one who is slightly loopy, I guess
<Twi_Fi> me flees.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> should i be scared ?
<WallDives> RAWRity: so, how far along are you in Mishizune's route~?

<Sumica> 00,10one of the few animes that I think is way better dubed
<Shizuka> 13^
<Ninjazz> Better than last time.
<Shane377> MahBoi777: he said my serves were unreturnable
<Ninjazz> Srry
<Digit|AFK-ish> agreed Sumica
<Meanwhile> Having never encountered the subbed version, I'll take your word for it
<Phase4> dat.... ghost in the shell?
<Kandarihu> I already saw the dub of this. And while I recognize that the dub was likely done respectfully, I'm curious about the original.
<Ninjazz> I wouldn't know since I only watched the dub.
<Shizuka> 13sumica streamed solid state society subbed... still like the dub better
<Sumica> 00,10gits is hard to follow subed
<MahBoi777> Phase4: I think so
<Ninjazz> It is.
<Shizuka> 13that's true... especially solid state society where they jump like four major plot threads over the course of the movie <3
<Sumica> 00,10I realy am pissed I lost my 2.0 version of the movie
<MahBoi777> I've never seen Ghost in a Shell, looks interesting
<Sumica> 00,10you ever seen 2.0 Shizuka?
<Lopy> MahBoi777: Same too
<Shizuka> 13innocence right? haven't seen yet
<Sumica> 00,10no they remastered the first movie
<Shizuka> 13saw the original movie... felt so terribly slow compared to SAC
<Shizuka> 13oh
<Shizuka> 13i will have to track that down~
<Sumica> 00,10using sac cgi for bits
<Sumica> 00,10it's like 30min longer
<Shizuka> 13pug man!
<Kandarihu> SSS goes by the same continuity as SAC, right?
<MahBoi777> Lopy: okay good, not alone lol :P
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Lopy> haha
<Shizuka> 13yeah it's like two years after 2ndGiG
<Ninjazz> Hey look! They actually use their lips to talk for once.
<Sumica> 00,10SSS is around 1-2 years after second gig
<Meanwhile> Talking with lips is overrated
<Lopy> Ninjazz: GASP
<Shizuka> 13one of the very few dubs where the lip sync almost never falls apart
<Shizuka> 13compare speed racer where they have to cram everything in
<Ninjazz> lol
<Meanwhile> Everybody run, its Godzirra!
<MahBoi777> Lol
*Sumica takes a deep breath
<Sumica> 00,10yes i see

<Sumica> 00,10So tonight was fun at work. IBM had a huge party
<Lopy> Party wooo

<Meanwhile> They're like teletubby versions of ED-209
<Ninjazz> This freakin good song...
<Mutterguy> The Dinner has been eaten!
<Sumica> 00,10I used to use this song as my alarm
<Kandarihu> You remember when she decommissioned them because she was afraid their growing individualities would make them unsuitable as weapons? She was right. They're not here as weapons but as soldiers.
<Ninjazz> God damn this song...
<Kencolt> Tachikoma. They are friendly, cute, happy, and only kill you under orders.
<Ninjazz> Sumica: Why the hell didn't i think of that?!
<Hazard> Ninjazz: you are my new Hero. Y U NO SAVE EARF FRUM MEATOR?!

<Digit|AFK-ish> nite Lopy ^^
<Ninjazz> Hazard: Understandable. But if you witnessed how Rarity was treated in the comments and replace her with Luna, you would flip a fuckin table.
<Mutterguy> bye g'night Lopy

<Ninjazz> :O
<Ninjazz> Actually...
<Kandarihu> It's amazing what I miss out of my anime when I'm at least partially asleep and am watching it for the first time with my mom. It takes a LOT of the goodness out of it.
<Ninjazz> I'm still kinda bummed out right now.
<d3rb> how come Ninjazz ?
<Ninjazz> Shit... This fucking good song...
<Sumica> 00,10here is one I like alot
<ModeabelvsModecelest> Dat song
<Kandarihu> And I pretty much blamed that entire circumstance for why I couldn't enjoy Bleach.
<Sumica> 00,10soon as this ends that is =p
<Shizuka> 13velveteen is good
<Hazard> Ninjazz: want the link?
<Ninjazz> d3rb, my favorite fic finally ended. I was named in the credits as a motivation. The ending basically turned me into a sad sad sad little girl and made me cry my eyes out. For the first time might I add.
<Sumica> 00,10indeed it is
<Tovler> Sumica's playing Lupin III again? *goes to Bronystate*

<Invi> brb
<Ninjazz> He kinda makes being a Cyborg sound bad...
<Meanwhile> What a story guy.
<Kandarihu> Did my IRC crash?
<Hat> d
<Sumica> 00,10that implys that there was a necular world war 4
<XAX> Phase4: tee eff 2?
<Ninjazz> Hat, welcome.
<Hat> Hai
<Hazard> "And when they realize what their going through... give them cake."
<Ninjazz> Who would have thought that there would still be a world after a world war 4.
<Hat> It must take a while to draw these shows
<Hazard> inb4 Fallout
<Kencolt> Just because he's an obvious conspiracy nut-- in this show-- does not mean he isn't right.
<Ninjazz> Ture...
<Phase4> XAX, school work sry :(
<Ninjazz> True...
<Hazard> Hat.
<XAX> Phase4: Ok then :)
<Hazard> Hat Hat.
<XAX> School > games
<Hat> Hazard
<Hazard> Hat Hat Hat Hat Hat.

<Hat> Deagles
<Hazard> touche
<Sumica> 00,10this ep reminds me of Taxi cab
<Mutterguy> Ninjazz, nah... if the major cities blow up You can probably build elsewhere. Nuclear winter is quite hard to achieve i think
<Hat> Everytime a gun moves in a show, it clicks
<Barrel_of_Fun> i hate that i am a paranoid skitz, and i hate that my doctor thinks this medicine works......
<Hazard> inb4 he shoots the mirror' it bounces off' and he nooters himself.
<Ninjazz> I see.
<Sumica> 00,10forthe record they have nano tech
<Hat> The Neigh
<Kandarihu> Dat Che poster. He sees what's probably only part of the problem. He thinks he has the answer, but all he has is more problems.
<Hazard> Thats some deep fucking shit...
<Sumica> 00,10and said nanotech has been used to scrub radiation
<Ninjazz> Well now...
<Hazard> Sumica: sounds easy really
<Ninjazz> Jeez, this guy should write poety...
<Meanwhile> This guy talks too much
<Meanwhile> Even if it is inside his own head
<Ninjazz> ^
<Kandarihu> He thinks a lot. He says almost nothing.
<Ninjazz> We can hear it... He talks to much.
<Hazard> Meanwhile: care if I remove him sire? *cocks shotgun and sheaths balistic knives*
<Kencolt> And we move from possibly right conspracy nut to possibly right stalker conspiracy nut.
*Meanwhile bonks Hazard with a cinderblock.
<Hat> What is teh_show
*Hazard eats the cinderblock and poops bricks
<Ninjazz> Someone dreams about playing hero.
<Sumica> 00,10he has some crazy daydreams
<Meanwhile> Hyehyehhyehhyeh
<xmasskills> hello everypony
<Ninjazz> You have beautiful eyes.
<Meanwhile> Allo xmasskills
<Hazard> Why.
<Ninjazz> xmasskills, welcome.
<Kencolt> Okayyyy... someone has a serious fantasy life. And he probably can't handle the truth.
<Hazard> Y U NO FUK MEH SUNNA
<Sumica> 00,10december 25th
<Kandarihu> right conspiracy nut? He has a Che Guevara poster in his living room and blames all the world's ills on corporations. This guy's a leftie.
<Meanwhile> Tomorrow that guy is gonna get shot doing something stupid
<Ninjazz> This guy is crazy.
<Mutterguy> noooo. according to wikipedia ( and presumely the articles it cites) nuclear winter is actually a real threat.
<Hat> What if he can duel wield
<Kencolt> And it's official. That's the DEFINITION of a Conspiracy Nut.... "Only I know the truth."
<Ninjazz> War?...
<xmasskills> RUN FROM THE PLANE
<XAX> dat feel when you miss a backstab by 0.1 milliseconds right in a crowd of enemies
<XAX> :()
<Kandarihu> I'm not saying he's not a conspiracy nut. Were you saying he's on the right wing?
<Ninjazz> Spy is hard class to master.
<Hazard> Rape Face
<Sumica> 00,10day dreams of telling his boss off
<Kencolt> He's on no known wing.
<ModeabelvsModecelest> RAPE
<Meanwhile> He daydreams too much.
<Ninjazz> Perhaps, he's just crazy.
<xmasskills> maybe he has a brain tumor
<Kandarihu> Oh, I realize. He sees everything as a right-wing conspiracy. Sorry.
<Hazard> -_(
<Hazard> \
<Ninjazz> Maybe even Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.
<Airpuff> Mornin' everypony x)
<ModeabelvsModecelest> i m a tumor
<Ninjazz> Airpuff, welcome.
<Meanwhile> Chances are he actually forgot.
<xmasskills> hes drunk
<Airpuff> What are we watching? =O
<Kencolt> He sees EVERYTHING as a conspiracy-- RIght, left, and center.
<Sumica> 00,10Ghost in the shell
<Shizuschlafen> 13sleepy time for me~
<Meanwhile> Probably because he's, you know, a chairman, he does important stuff. And you're basically the taxi driver
<Mutterguy> Acctually I could see that Humanity in desperation to prevent global warming... they set of a whole bunch of nukes
<Airpuff> =O

<ModeabelvsModecelest> inb4 barney
<Sumica> 00,10it was all in his head.
<Digitalis> ewwww
<Ninjazz> Nope.
<Kandarihu> I'd honestly like to think that Motoko and Batau clandestinely counselled him out of crossing the line.
<Sumica> 00,10she was diveing in to his brain
<xmasskills> Meanwhile: it does not matter you still got ninja'd
<Airpuff> mental.... =s
<Ninjazz> He caught an STD? and he lost his legs from it?

<xmasskills> thats how the episode ends i couldnt follow it at all
<Meanwhile> Go for it.
<Hat> I didn't know all these good shows existed before bronystate

<Digitalis> yesh please :D
<Ninjazz> WAKE UP
<Hazard> i dont give a FUCK!!!
<Hazard> :D
<Ninjazz> Damn this song.
<Sumica> 00,10it was a stand alone ep
<xmasskills> YEEAAAH!!
<Sumica> 00,10no real impact on the meta story
<Kencolt> Bronystate can open your eyes, true. We aren't ENTIRELY about Ponies.
<Kandarihu> It's kind of a profile of one of many people in this world.
<Ninjazz> The beauty within the shell.
<Kandarihu> Er, in that world. Dangit
<Hat> The shell is also perty!
<Ninjazz> Kencolt: Amen, brother.
<Ninjazz> But I still gotta say.
<Ninjazz> Poni Poni Poni Poni Poni Poni
<Airpuff> ô.ó
<ModeabelvsModecelest> lol MGM
<Digitalis> o.o
<xmasskills> -.(\
<Kandarihu> That button was from the last TD
<Airpuff> Lol.. reset the world button
<Hat> Nice going
<Ninjazz> What? No crunch?
<Digitalis> hehe
<Invi> dese blue things are.... strange
<xmasskills> dig dug
<Hat> LUNA
*Ninjazz stomps feet to beat
<Ninjazz> or hooves if you care.
<Sumica> 00,10it's my wall paper
<Meanwhile> Guess I should go find something resembling breakfast.
*xmasskills eats shrimp coctail
<Ninjazz> Hmmm.
<Ninjazz> How do you say that french saying?
<Digitalis> I ate leftover pizza with honey bbq sauce as my breakfast xD
<Ninjazz> Bon apetite, Meanwhile?
<Kandarihu> Invi: the Tachikomas are the comic relief of the whole series. AIs who express far more humans than most cyborgs in the series.
<Kencolt> Ihonestly preferred the First GIg OP, and song tho.
<xmasskills> can someone give me a basic plot description of this series
<Kandarihu> Er, express far more humanity than most of the cyborgs in the series.
<Hazard> Plot?
<Ninjazz> Is that even possible?
<Hazard> PLOT?!
<Sumica> 00,10they are an elete team of somthing akin to swat
<Invi> Kandarihu so they are human simulated AI ?
<Hazard> PLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTT?!
<Airpuff> Wounder woman?
<Ninjazz> No. Its the Commander.
<Airpuff> Oh.. xD
<Kencolt> The Major and her amazing "I'm not naked but I might as well be" camo suit.
<xmasskills> Ninjazz: in these types of anime giving a plot description is hard but not impossible
<Ninjazz> shit
<Ninjazz> Major
<ModeabelvsModecelest> Mirror'edge to the extreme
<Ninjazz> Not without some major thinking first, xmasskills.
<Hazard> im a little pony clippity CLOP clippity CLOP
<Sumica> 00,10best pocket ever
<Ninjazz> O///O
<Airpuff> lololol
<Kencolt> Although this is a lot less revealing than her usual battlesuit from season 1.
<Hazard> such a TEASE
<Digitalis> perfect place to keep stuffs ^^
<Airpuff> Sooo harcore.
<Airpuff> xD
<Ninjazz> Dat Railgun
<xmasskills> using a coin
<Kandarihu> No. Their AIs aren't even made to be humanlike. They're "Think Tanks" designed to carry a crew of one, or fight autonomously without a pilot inside. After every deployment, they all synchronize their combat data with each other.
<Hat> Cloak mode also negates fall damage
<Ninjazz> O///O
<Sumica> 00,10she is a cyborg
<xmasskills> anyone else feel the old guy is a perv
<Sumica> 00,10that fall is noting\
<Sumica> 00,10dem pants
<Hazard> constantley watching her chest,,,
<Ninjazz> Whoa.
<Digitalis> haha xD
<Ninjazz> Dem perv eyes
<Hat> But I won't tell you where it is
<ModeabelvsModecelest> Pervert lol
<Mutterguy> boobs- good place to put additional hardware
<Phase4> http://derpy.me/O36yx
<xmasskills> Hat is it under your hat
<Airpuff> One does not simply look away from the boobs.
<Hat> :O
<Kandarihu> Batau loved them like crazy, and singled out one of them as his "personal" tachikoma and gave it natural oil instead of synthetic oil. This eventually caused normally disconnected parts of it's AI to become connected, and it became self-aware. When it synchronized it's data with the other, they all became self-aware.
<Ninjazz> Phase4: Double Bass Cannon is ganna be OP as hell!
<Sumica> 00,10long story short he's holding a pervert party
<Kandarihu> After that, they'd spend every day in the hanger discussing at length the nature of the meaning of life and death.
<Capn_Gavn> pervert party is best party
<Ninjazz> Plot.
<Digitalis> Oh god... this guy
<Sumica> 00,10he's horny for love dolls
<ModeabelvsModecelest> Giggity
<Digitalis> haha xD
<Ninjazz> Well, considering what Major looks like.. Can't really blame the guy.
<Digitalis> yup
<Sumica> 00,10it's not just her

<digletxmas> TheRainbowDash good ta see ya
<Kandarihu> Well, if your grades aren't good, you won't be able to make it into college. But maybe this is a good thing. Young adults who go to college tend to come back brainwashed.
<Ninjazz> O_O
<TheRainbowDash> digletxmas: And as of you too, how are you today?
<Ninjazz> Well, that takes alot off my mind Kandarihu.
<Ninjazz> And if you must know TheRainbowDash, I haz problems and everyone is cheering me up.
<digletxmas> Kandarihu: that isnt true he can still make it to college just not fancy pancy colleges like hardvard
<Malavolent> There are lots of people who didn't get through college, yet they became succesful at their lives.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: What kind of problems are these now?
<digletxmas> TheRainbowDash idk the day hasnt even started its 3 am right now but im good
<Ninjazz> Welp. My favorite fic ended. I am about to turn 18 in a few hours. My grades suck. And a whole bunch other things.
<XAX> Hello again :>
<digletxmas> Ninjazz why are you so worried about turning 18
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Hey, today is your birthday or something?
<Ninjazz> Responsibilyu, digletxmas.
<derpy_pony> the fancy pancy universities get all the private projects and research investments...the community colleges can't even afford to send students to scientific conventions in the same state
<Ninjazz> Responsibilty*
<tr> I'm going to bed
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Almost. in about 3 hours.
<tr> later everypony
<Frank> Cya tr
<d3rb> just remember Ninjazz, life was never meant to be easy, just need to try and overcome these challenges, learn and grow from them
<Kandarihu> There are too many college professors who make it their goal in life to widen the generation gap as much as possible. If you go to any college at all, be very careful when you are tempted to abandon the values that your parents raised you on.
<Ninjazz> Cya tr
<Invi> d3rb xD life is easy as hell in a industrial country
<d3rb> catcha tr, thanks for the attempted help
<d3rb> lol
<Ninjazz> I will do that. Both of you, Kandarihu and d3rb.
<Digitalis> Lmao!
<Ninjazz> DEAD
<TheRainbowDash> Bye tr! (kisses you)
<XAX> Ninjazz: Fic complete. Authors notes and all.
<XAX> Reading of fic*
<digletxmas> Ninjazz i guess responsibility can be scary but im sure you can handle it and turnin 18 doesnt make you responible for everything immediatly
<Ninjazz> Did you see me? :>
<XAX> Of course :>
<Ninjazz> I hope so, digletxmas.
<derpy_pony> you still get some noob protection
<derpy_pony> except if you act like a jerk
<Malavolent> Your responsibility officialy begins by getting kicked out of your parents house. Needless to say, some people are 30 and they're not responsible yet.
<digletxmas> Ninjazz: always hope for the best cuz in the end hope is what keeps us going
<Ninjazz> :)
<Invi> Ninjazz who cares about responsibility? as long as you don't kill nobody or crush everything it's fine ^^
<Ninjazz> 6_9
<Invi> *somebody
<XAX> Ninjazz: Your fic. How long until you might release abit of it? :<
<Ninjazz> Heh. I don't know... Until I am happy with it.
<XAX> Good point.
<Ninjazz> I need to make sure that I actually make sense with it.
<digletxmas> Ninjazz: whats your fic about can i read it when its ready???
*XAX would happily proof-read/edit.
<derpy_pony> a general liability insurance might be a good idea. just in case. they are cheap. I pay 6€ per month.
<Ninjazz> What I am trying to do is fill in gaps between the show.
<TheRainbowDash> For me about writing that story, I'll get it finished by 5/6, but will have to delay any more stories because of finals.:P
<Ninjazz> Of course, digletxmas. Its about Pinkie Pie.
<Mutterguy> Ninjazz let us preread it!
<XAX> ^
<Ninjazz> :D I can't right now. Its still in like its... 6th revision.

<Ninjazz> I've been really lazy though.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: More revisions!:[ - Pinkie Pie
<Kandarihu> Ninjazz: making sense of things is good and important. But understand that there's always going to be something that doesn't make perfect sense, especially to one who is obsessed with reason and logic.
<Frank> aeiou
<Ninjazz> True...
<Ninjazz> I just want to make sure that it would make sense WITHIN the canon.
<TheRainbowDash> For my reasons Ninjazz, very cynical and reality touched, I just accept my problems and just fix them.
<digletxmas> Ninjazz what in the name of heck makes sense in pinkie pie's world
<Kandarihu> Oh, you're talking about a fanfic.
<Shane377> TheRainbowDash: o hai
<Malavolent> Pinkie Pie can do whatever she want. She's Pinkie.
<Ninjazz> digletxmas: Something that properly needs to be written.
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Shane377! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
<Kandarihu> I thought you were talking about your rl future.
<Ninjazz> lol
*Shane377 waves back "good"
<Ninjazz> Nahhh. I'm the kind of person that thinks too far into the future.
<Ninjazz> not*
*Ninjazz facehoof
<thegt90> u know whats hard about gt5 trying to pick a car u want to drive for the low end races
<xmasskills> Ninjazz thats a good trait
<TheRainbowDash> Shane377: Good to hear then. If you ask me, I'm doing just ok. Goddamn finals....:|
<JRP2234> sumica has dickshep been a dick latley
<Shane377> lol TheRainbowDash
<JRP2234|webchat> but i love dickshep
<TheRainbowDash> Literary in 15 days Shane377.

<Invi> http://mylittleremix.com/submission/list.php?event=26%22 30 days remain :) yaaay
<thegt90> low end races for the seasonal events
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: For my first fanfic, it would be about 10-15k words, it that a little too much for my first ever story?
<Kandarihu> Well, diplomacy is the name of this game. It's hard to be a jerk when you're trying to win everyone's favor.
<Malavolent> I wonder how hard are these finals in the US. Everyone keeps talking about them.
<Kandarihu> It's hard to win everyone's favor when you're being a jerk.
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Just make sure its interesting to read and nothing should ever "too long"
<AttackWithHugs> I'm going back to bed. It's 7am here and I want to get as much sleep as possible in the next 3 to 4 hours. See you guys later this week or whenever I can get on.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Oh, yeah, hmm, about Rainbow Dash getting into the WonderBolts and her arrogance leaves her dream secluded with her other friends, I'll try to make that interesting the whle way.
<Meanwhile> Bye AttackWithHugs
<Kandarihu> Ninjazz: sometimes, you might have to read the not-so-fun and really-long th... oh, you're talking about fics again.
<Shane377> http://static3.fjcdn.com/thumbnails/comments/Rainbow+Dash+3+_b12b45c4cb0d3a48139d90bcd1b4e63f.jpg wow sucha good wallpaper

*AttackWithHugs huggles Meanwhile and d3rd and Invi and TheRainbowDash and Ninjazz and the rest of the chat
<Ninjazz> Time to talk about somethinga a bit more cheerful.
<Meanwhile> That's something I don't like about ME3 biotics, the pull throw combo causes an explosion instead of the infinitely more fun space cannon effect.
<Kandarihu> Well, I still have 2 cats left.
<xmasskills> Ninjazz i know lets talk about.... wait for it ponies
<Ninjazz> I miss my cats... :'(
*d3rb crosses fingers and hopes i havent broken what i was fixing
<TheRainbowDash> Wait, what is this Bronyquest Fundraiser? Is anypony here participating in it
<XAX> I can't think of a single original idea for a fic.
<XAX> I think they've all been used up...
<Meanwhile> Well it works doesn't it Sumica.

<Meanwhile> Chat question, how do you pronounce Lyra?
<Ninjazz> brb
<TheRainbowDash> Meanwhile: Lie-rah.

<Invi> I've called her Lüra earlier ^^
<Frank> Epicpwntime I think its Mass effect 3
<Frank> So true Shane377
<dshannon> but there is still that veeeery small chance that it won't happen :P
<Meanwhile> Based on the pronounciation of lyre, I think Lie-rah would be the technically correct one.
<Invi> Shane377 dats true
<TheRainbowDash> Shane377: Hmm, completely true. Without us, the show may be exitinct already.
<EpicPwnTime> mass effect 3 huh? maybe i should take a look on wikipedia and see.
<Frank> We must be very proud of ourselfs
<Invi> indeedn Meanwhile, but let's ask google ^^
<xmasskills> Shane377: i dont even think there would be a season 2
*Frank taps on shoulder
<Meanwhile> A dead guy is you!
<Malavolent> Meanwhile: In my country, Lyre is Lyra, so I pronounce it that way I pronounce the musical instrument.
<Meanwhile> And how do you pronounce the instrument?
<Malavolent> Also, the more you say Lyra, the wierder it gets 6_9
<Frank> In-stru-ment
<Frank> 6_9
<Meanwhile> O u.
<Frank> Do i deserve a cookie now?
*Meanwhile hands Frank a biscuit.
<TheRainbowDash> Alright silly filles, sorry that I have to go right now. Bye everypony, and I hope to see you here later today.:
<TheRainbowDash> :)
<Invi> it is officially to pronounce Lyra as: [lahy-ruh]

<Invi> what happens if you scan Sumi?

<XAX> I've never played Black Ops though. So I have no idea :p
<Invi> oh. nice ^^

<Mutterguy> does the dragon have a breath weapon?
<Ninjazz> But... I usually get excited for CoD games but get very very disappointed later on.
<d3rb> its another cod game so i just think meh
<ofna01> WOODS! : D
<Ninjazz> But that still doesn't change the fact that Treyarch actually manages to make good story line and a decent multiplayer experience.
<Ninjazz> Decent, mind you.
<d3rb> I've never played the tryarch cods
<d3rb> bleh, dat spelling
<Ninjazz> Don't play CoD 3.
<ofna01> a futuristic COD?
<ofna01> :O
<Kammerjunk> Yay for easy exams!
<Ninjazz> Yeah. Way more futuristic than MW3.

<Ninjazz> See if its actually worth it.

<ofna01> then i might borrow BO2 from my buddy
<Skylands> 10Back

<Ninjazz> Hmmm.
<Ninjazz> I would say Swarm of the Century
<d3rb> s2e3 is good
<Ninjazz> But some of the fan vids we made are good too.
<d3rb> but alot of the fan stuff you only get if you've seen the show, epic cupcake time is an excewption though
<ofna01> http://twilight.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/133437351495.gif

<Sumica> 00,10not sure but i guess it helps to live in europe
<Kammerjunk> "Ever since I moved to Ponyville, we've been seeing each other less and less." This obviously means that stuff does happen between episodes.

<Ninjazz> You should have been here, ofna01.
<Jim> Ohai Ingwaz
<Ninjazz> Ingwaz, welcome.
<Twi_Fi> Hello Ingwaz.
<ofna01> Luna!
<Sumica> 00,10I like the luna sniper comic for this bit
<Ninjazz> Epic Line Incoing
<Ingwaz> hello Twi_Fi
<RainbowAsh> Green magic = evilz
<Digitalis> WHO GOES THERE?!
<Chezne> eyup
<ofna01> AWW
<Sumica> 00,10Flutershy just flashed Twi
<Ingwaz> we watching the finale again?
<ofna01> THEIR DEAD
<Ninjazz> LOL
<Ninjazz> Mica
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: Yeah, but I mean if they have to actively raise the Moon and Sun, if it's something happening just by them willing it without performing a spell. I haven't even decided on whether or not they "magnetically" shove each other away, and if so, how eclipses work!
<Kammerjunk> I must know!
<ofna01> uh
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk: Leave it up to the fanon to fill in the gaps.
<Jim> Tl:dr : Magnets, how do they work.
<Sumica> 00,10you are asuming there are eclipses
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: I AM THE FANON!
<Ingwaz> Kammerjunk: its magic, magic doesnt give a crap about what you want to know. it doesnt have to explain itself
<ofna01> Spike
<Ninjazz> OBJECTION!
<ofna01> I OBJECT!
*ofna01 raises his hand
<derpy_pony> twilight troll
<Jim> Eviiiiiiiiiiiilll
<Digitalis> EVILLL!!
<ofna01> EEEEEEEVIIIIIIIIIIIL
<Ninjazz> Here comes Siblings.mp4
<RainbowAsh> Ingwaz, but consistency is a mark of a good magic system
<derpy_pony> rapeface
<Kammerjunk> Dem Derpy eyes.
<RyunosukeKnT> you know... something should have clicked
<ofna01> Celestia is just like Wut
<Jim> http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_liwvb3yfZp1qdgu7s.jpg
<Ninjazz> Gotta love Twi's rape face.
<Ingwaz> RainbowAsh: magic doesnt necessarily need to be consistent either
<ofna01> serious pony face
<Sumica> 00,10So does twi have a reputation of lieing?
<Mutterguy> bluff skill level 23
<Kammerjunk> Sumica: No.
<Ninjazz> Nope.
<Mutterguy> nope
<RyunosukeKnT> Twilight, calling the best foalsitter of all of foalsitter history EVER being evil should have ... sent up some sort of warning :)
<Jim> How is using magic not casting spells?
<Ninjazz> But she has been known to jump the gun before, Sumica.
<ofna01> :(
<Twi_Fi> No, but Twi does have a reputation for overreacting.
<Sumica> 00,10and yet none of her friends and family even considder her concerns at all
<Kammerjunk> Not even Celestia. So much for protegé.
<Ninjazz> Celestia especially...
<ofna01> ikr
<Twi_Fi> Weddings bring out the worse in ponies.
<derpy_pony> she sat there like a beaten dog
<Ninjazz> Her words hurt like hell for some reason.
<ofna01> Trollestia much?
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: I know, right.
<d3rb> but she said at the start how annoyed she was at her brother for not telling her
<Jim> oh this part gives me shivers
<d3rb> so maybe they all thought she was just jealous
<Ninjazz> And then goes and makes me cry... dat face she makes...
<RyunosukeKnT> still... calling her most favorite foalsitter and possibly the 5th most respected pony in Twi's foalhood as an evil soulsucking demon is kinda.... much ... even for Twi :)
<RainbowAsh> Ingwaz, well, if it is inconsistent it just leads to a world where any random thing can happen at any time without any explanation. That is detrimental to good storytelling.
<derpy_pony> and now the awesome part starts
<ofna01> WAT
<Ingwaz> agree...but then again, its easy enough for people to not see something when theyre particularly involved in something. plus, they did not know cadance as twilight did, so they have nothing to base their opinion on either. they were probably just trying to love and tolerate her even if she was being a bit difficult, she is the bride after all
<d3rb> ssssgh
<ofna01> :O
<Ninjazz> Here comes the Disney...
<Kammerjunk> "You will be... You will be..." - Yoda
<Twi_Fi> THE END!

<Simon2> hello everybody
<Mutterguy> this bit needs a Star trek styled to be continued...
<Ninjazz> lol
<Ninjazz> Simon2, welcome.
<d3rb> lolol
<Twi_Fi> Hello Simon2.

<Sumica> 00,10oki
<RyunosukeKnT> Celestia... possibly Shining Armor would though
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Shoo be Doo

<LightTrooper105> hello Simon2
<Ingwaz> human under water, Y U NO DROWN!?
<Sumica> 00,10Twi should have called for seaponies
<Simon2> hi LightTrooper105
<ofna01> I DO NOT LIKE SEAPONIES
<Twi_Fi> Sumica, indeed.
<d3rb> i liek seaponies
<ofna01> :[
<Ingwaz> dat yay
<Simon2> I don't like sea ponies
<Ninjazz> Everypony should have called upon the sea ponies.
<Sumica> 00,10hey dont dis my people
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: So... Did you look at Cadence's magic colour?
<ofna01> Sumi,do the next part please!
<Jim> Sea ponies are awesome
<mighty-pumpkin> Still Twilight was overprotective towards Shining Armor. You know... calling Cadence evil. That was just a random throw.
<Ninjazz> They are just blind still, Sumica.
<Jim> G4 needs more sea ponies
<Ninjazz> Soon.
<Ingwaz> i wonder who thought this up...
<RainbowAsh> Ingwaz, random =/= funny. To make it funny you need to subvert expectations. For that there needs to be a world in which can support expectations and allow assumptions about what should happen.
<ofna01> i wont be able to do anything else if you just leave it at that
<Ingwaz> i really do
<Ninjazz> Soon...
<Ninjazz> Ingwaz: I did. :)
<Mutterguy> they're good with chips }:D
<Ninjazz> I asked for it.
<ofna01> GREEN MAGIC

<Jim> Likely story, Mark
<Nitram> this is so cute but so sad...

<Ingwaz> i think smile smile smile rated just slightly higher on EQD poll for favorite song of the season
<Nitram> <3 this song
<RainbowAsh> Ingwaz, she is funny because she exists in a consistant world, which she keeps subverting.
<ofna01> O___O
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ LOVE those eyes!
<mighty-pumpkin> no it's other way around Ingwaz
<Ninjazz> I am still learning the high parts in this song.
<Xera> I like the cadence thing they did in this song.
<RainbowAsh> Ingwaz, if every pony was like Pinkie Pie in a world of discord, that humor would fall flat.
<ofna01> :|
<Ingwaz> RainbowAsh: indeed, but when pinkie is around, you can't count on anything to be constant
<Hy> go play pokemon

<Sumica> 00,10love CMC's in this, they look so cute
<ofna01> >:|
<Cypresswolf> and then 6 minuts of commercials!
<Ninjazz> But people have told me that I have an amazing voice. Singing and speaking.
<eXAKR> Won the first time, went and healed my Pokémon, went to talk to her again, pressed A too fast, suddenly another battle with her
<eXAKR> And I won both times
<Ingwaz> Sumica: cmc are always cute. particularly scoots
<Ninjazz> And yes, the CMCs were incredibly DAAAAAAWWW
<ofna01> :O
<Nitram> zombies!!!
<Xera> Amazing voice, eh?
<Ingwaz> inb4 zombie ponies
<Simon2> y u no use teleportation again
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: People can barely understand my voice because it's "just a rumble to [them]". And I sing like manure.
<LemonJuice> OBJECTION!
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk: Yet, you type like an angel..
<Digitalis> I could sing... I choose not to ^///^
<Ingwaz> LemonJuice: that would have been pure win
<Kammerjunk> I type like a sdfgasg
<Twi_Fi> *gasp*
<ofna01> MAgic
<Simon2> You ponies could have used teleportation
<Ninjazz> sfdgasg is the new asdf.
<ofna01> LAWL
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: Look at Cadence's magic colour.
<ofna01> its green
<ofna01> i know
<Ingwaz> you know...i just thought...that bouquet was probably thrown to their death
<Nitram> Chrysalis!
<Twi_Fi> yes
<Kammerjunk> INB4 best pony.
<Ninjazz> Ready for the new best villain?
<ofna01> :O
<Twi_Fi> awesome
<Sumica> 00,10no her color is teal
<Simon2> dem holes
<ofna01> whoa
<Sumica> 00,10btw some one brouhg up a good point.
<Nitram> soooo creepy
<ofna01> O_O
<Jim> dat villian
*Digitalis fangirl squeal
<Sumica> 00,10A ponys magic colr matches their cutiemark.
<Ninjazz> Hmmm.
<ofna01> :'(
<Ninjazz> That's right...
<Kammerjunk> I was going to request a wetmane Chrysalis, but what's the point?
<Jim> Does changelings have cutiemarks?
<Ninjazz> But Chrysalis doesnt have one?
<Mutterguy> evil fillys have a reverb in their voice...
<Kammerjunk> Jim: No.
<ofna01> nope
<ofna01> :O
<Ingwaz> Sumica: huh...i hadnt thought of that...but shining armor's color is pink, yet its not necessarily the main color. he does have pink in it though
<Jim> Assuming direct controll
<Ninjazz> And btw. That is Trixie's VA.
<Nitram> Time for epic fight! Go Celestia!
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: Yup. So Trixie was in the final anyway!
<Hy> http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17924190
<Hy> mfw
<ofna01> ORLLY?
<eXAKR> Though - reminder to self - when using Lucario against her Lucario, use Close Combat to down it.
<Ninjazz> Yep.
<Ingwaz> Sumica: i suspect its more along the lines of it matches the central color of the cutie mark
<Sumica> 00,10I never said main color
<Simon2> dat Celestia fail
<Kammerjunk> >YFW Trixie was Chrysalis in disguise.
<Ninjazz> So Trixie fans get something...
<Sumica> 00,10just the color matches
<Ninjazz> GOOOO CELESTIA!
<RainbowAsh> No love for Gilda :/
<ofna01> Celestia wins,=!
<ofna01> WAT
<Ingwaz> Sumica: indeed, i'm just attempting to further clarify to see if its correct. which it seems to be
<derpy_pony> and this is how celestia died

<PinkiePry> Hello everypony. :)
<derpy_pony> effect
<Twi_Fi> It's no kiss sadly, we analyzed the scene with great detail.
<twilight_sprinkle> it is inevitable, mr. anderson..
<Ninjazz> I have been frame by framing it so many times.

<ofna01> PArty cannon as a weapon?
<Ninjazz> Buts its odd aint it?
<ofna01> AWESOME!
<Simon> If in human world, it's called humanity, is it called ponity in this pony world?
<Kammerjunk> Twilight cannon is canon.
<Ninjazz> Well, Twilight is now Cannon.
<Litwick> Can I say it?

<Simon> mighty-pumpkin: so you prefer human over pony huh?
<ofna01> .-.
<mighty-pumpkin> my ears
<Ninjazz> Wow, They actually had to hold Dash by herself.
<ofna01> that voice
<Cypresswolf> I wonder, even if the mane 6 got to the door that houses the elements, how would they retrieve them if the door could only be unlocked by Celestia?
<Sumica> 00,10oh the poligmay?
<derpy_pony> send away all the guards....
<twilight_sprinkle> dat weak apology
<mighty-pumpkin> and no Simon
<mighty-pumpkin> don't be silly simon
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Cypresswolf: twi can probably unlock it too
<Ninjazz> Ehhh Twilight is used to it by now.
<Jim> dat Whooves
<Kammerjunk> Cypresswolf: Oh, that wasn't Celestia unlocking it. It was just Celestia x keyhole.
<Litwick> The Great and Powerful Cheysalis!
<Mutterguy> also this episode I learnt that applejack has hat space
<Ninjazz> Such a good voice.
<Simon> mighty-pumpkin : fuck you I do what I want
<twilight_sprinkle> looks like cadence can only use heart magic
<RX-78-SweetieBot> AJ has always hat magic hat powers
<Sumica> 00,10all ponys have mallet space
<Ninjazz> Daaaw
<RX-78-SweetieBot> had*
<RainbowAsh> Cypresswolf, maybe security measures were revamped after Discord was easily able to steal the elements.
<Cypresswolf> In Return of Harmony 1 - Celestia says only she knows the spell that unlocks that door
<Ninjazz> And its Hammerspace
<PinkiePry> Dat love power/
<Nitram> Love saves the day
<mighty-pumpkin> :(
<Kammerjunk> Cypresswolf: Well, yeah. She didn't want the Mane 6 to know of her affair with the keyhole.

<Cypresswolf> that scrunch face :)
<Ninjazz> Oh come on. Serriously? Hate on her for not appologizing? Give her a god damn break.
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: Rarity probably didn't want her putting her hat on.
<derpy_pony> celestia is a priest?
<ofna01> how do other ponys get married?
<Ninjazz> She is the "goddess"
<ofna01> if they dont have horns....
<Mutterguy> She's as official as one can get
<Kammerjunk> derpy_pony: She's a Princess. She can do whatever the hay she wants.
<d3rb> hoof rings?
<twilight_sprinkle> anyway even if celestia did apologize, she still sucks
<Sumica> 00,10kinda like the captan of a ship
<LemonJuice> ear rings maybe?
<Kammerjunk> What Susu said.
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle: Right...
<Twi_Fi> A lesson to be learned.

<RX-78-SweetieBot> PinkiePry: stop ruining the joke
<Simon2> damn you lag
<ofna01> I DEMAND IT
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: They're magenta or something.
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: at least luna doesnt act high and mighty
<RainbowAsh> All considered, Twilight's case against deceptive Cadence was weak. Shining's explanations held up. Twilight was just incredibly lucky that she really was evil.
<Jim> you will for a second or so
<mighty-pumpkin> Did I just hear that love is blue? wat
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle: What does that mean?
<thegt90> just a split second tough
<ofna01> :$
<Jim> Love is in bloom
<Simon2> Fuck you lag
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: That boy needs therapy?
<ofna01> YES
<Cypresswolf> Season 3 - Applejack sings! She's the only one who hasnt yet
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk: He sure does..
<Lomse250> dat face
<Twi_Fi> The Element of Generosity....
<ofna01> i thought Lyra wuld catch it XD
<Ninjazz> Everyone please look at RainbowAsh's comment.
<Litwick> HEY FLARE. COLGATE GOT THE BOUQUET.
<RainbowAsh> Kammerjunk, someone argued that they are actually are reddish, because you have to take the blue tint of the whole scene into account
<Ninjazz> Just shutup and think for five seconds and read it.
<mighty-pumpkin> twilight_sprinkle Are we even talking about the same Celestia?
<Mutterguy> bit late spike!
<Kammerjunk> And then Rarity married Applejack.
<ofna01> Spike,thats supposed to be BEFORE the wedding....
<Twi_Fi> THE END!
<Ninjazz> I see someone supports RariJack.
*ofna01 facehofs
<Jim> Spike is a slowpoke
<Kammerjunk> RainbowAsh: Fair 'nuff.
<LemonJuice> Well, he is a BABY dragon
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: what about trust?
<Simon2> The greatest episode in My Little Pony series so far
<d3rb> next ep? oh wait.....sigh
<RyunosukeKnT> pony bachelor parties, how do they work, ponies are (generally) already naked :)
<Cypresswolf> Spike will have one in Shining's honor
<LemonJuice> YES!!!!!
<ofna01> ?
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: they couldve not bitched at Twilight who was just doing a good thing
<LemonJuice> Best song
<Twi_Fi> Who supports RariJack?
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle: Twilight has been known to jump the gun. Celestia should know this.
<Fattonie> d3rb: :(
<RX-78-SweetieBot> RyunosukeKnT: use your imagination
<Digitalis> I support nothing!
*Digitalis flips over table
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle: Its a wedding. Twilight was giving off the sense of being jealous.
<ofna01> that yellow pony look like twi to anyone else?
<Twi_Fi> <_<
<Kammerjunk> I'd say "Dat heil", but it's probably been said.

<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: point is, she only wanted to the right thing, everyone, including celestia, grounded her into the dust for being wrong
<ofna01> pinkie arrow
<RainbowAsh> Ugh, not that video again. :/
<Simon2> Yup, killing people. Pinkie's perfect role
<ofna01> LOL
<Cypresswolf> Work time!

<Xer[a]> Goodbye.
<ofna01> pinkie,Y U SO BRUTAL?
<Kammerjunk> Wait, mini-Pinkies as weapons and arrows?
<Kammerjunk> Not sure if like.
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle: Could you blame them? We knew from the start. But no pony else.
<ofna01> eeyup
<Digitalis> yep :D
<LightTrooper105> Saturn dat Unary Decimal

<Saturn> 8,1Mutterguy: what about it?

<ofna01> O_O
<Digitalis> =_(\
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle: Please don't take this the wrong way, man. But please get over it. Details, details.
<Kammerjunk> This video is too well made to hate.
<ofna01> damn pinkie
<Mutterguy> could they have for what ever crazy reason mean that
<Twi_Fi> SMILE
<Fattonie> This and hearing it during tf2 with giblets everywhere only makes me associate this song with some sadistic thoughts now
<ofna01> SMILE OR DIE
<mighty-pumpkin> twilight_sprinkle: off-screen apology

<Kammerjunk> Dat mugsmash.
<Ninjazz> I mean, obviously Luna is better because... Well, she actually gets SOME character develoment. But what does Celestia get? Memes. Bad ones too.
<Jim> Or is this just fantasy?
<ofna01> Vinyl reminds me of myself
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: memes are memes, theyre just jokes.
<ofna01> i like to jam my music
