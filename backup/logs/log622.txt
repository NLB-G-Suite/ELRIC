<MASF123|> I'm still having trouble regaining my sanity.
<MASF123|> I need to catch them with a net and put them in this jar.
<sagas> So what will you stream Wrek?
<Wrek> dunno yet
<MASF123|> Probably Star Trek like he usually does.
<MASF123|> Or some art.
<Bronysith> Wrek: are you getting a game pad someitme?
<cowvarkian> he normally streams art, or tf2, or new vegas
<Wrek> never
<Bronysith> all righty then
<MASF123|> Wrek you don't like gamepads?
<Wrek> i wont cater to the lazy game devs
<Wrek> they said it would be a PC port
<sagas> cowvarkian: I know
<Wrek> so i expect functioning controls
<Vivix> test
<Wrek> or its an incomplete product
<Ponies47> BUNNEH! :[
<PillowPoni> Hey Wrek. How's your sunday?
<cowvarkian> wrek what is this "it" we speak of
<Vivix> Dark Souls
<cowvarkian> ah, ok
<cowvarkian> well, its just a port
<MadSurge> Hello Wrek! :) How are you today?
<sagas> Vivix: is a pain in the ass
<Wrek> 's been decent
<MadSurge> STREAM
<cowvarkian> ah, so a tf2 stream
<Vivix> sagas I haven't tried it, but sounds like it
<sagas> Vivix: Oh it is
<LunarSS> Wrek: didn't they basiclly say they were goning to put no effort into it
<Vivix> Okay, I'm testing Hydra irc- so I can be on when I play- so confused
<Major|Busy> and Im back :3
<MASF123|> Was Dark Souls supposed to be a PS3 exclusive in Japan but in Merica it is on Xbox, PS3, And PC?
<Vivix> and all my pings are off
<sagas> Wrek: Ah MvM
<sagas> Wrek: But no music to go with it?
<Stallion_of_War> I'm pretty sure the cover art for Doctor Who isn't 4 18-24 year old girls sitting around a table. Although that might not be too bad
<Bronysith> damn it
<Bronysith> final fantasy 8 is good
<DrSteveSCARz> what i miss?
<cowvarkian> nothing
<cowvarkian> refresh
<MASF123|> Fuck I'm too tired for this shit.
<sagas> Im hearing Wrek pings and its confusing me
<DrSteveSCARz> ohh tf2
<cowvarkian> are you too old for this shit?
<sagas> and it crashes
<Major> So what did I miss?
<sub06905> CMC are best soldiers: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2ukh09t2w1r9ntj6o1_500.png
<cowvarkian> MASF123|: are you too old for this shit?
<Major> sub06905: awesome
<Rustymeat> I see tf 2
<sagas> and buffer again
<MASF123|> cowvarkian no I'm not Bill
<Stallion_of_War> BOLLOCKS TO IT ALL! SCREW THIS INTERNET! I'M GOING TO GO DRAW AVATAR SPARKLE!
<cowvarkian> cool
<Major>
<Bronysith> remember when you paid full price for a game and you got like 100 hours of gameplay from the story alone?
<cowvarkian> yes
<MASF123|> Damn this loads forever
<Buytoast> how dare you want enjoyment from a game
<MASF123|> that's like 4 evers of load time.
<cowvarkian> speaking of, imma go play metal gear now
<DrSteveSCARz> MASF123|: Thats TF2 for ya
<LunarSS> Bronysith: games like that still exist
<Bronysith> and now you pay full price for a game and you only get 1 hour from the story
<Aircrafter> Hello Everyponyyyy
<Major> Aircrafter: Hi
<Bronysith> LunarSS: not really, not anymore
<DrSteveSCARz> hay Aircrafter
<Ponies47> Hello Aircrafter
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: thats a fast run
<PillowPoni> Hi Aircrafter
<MASF123|> What language is that German?
<cowvarkian> swedish
<LunarSS> Bronysith: no they do, i mean there are less of them but still
<MASF123|> If this is the German version then the blood is censored.
<cowvarkian> the games I play take at least 30 hours or so
<AJIsAwesome> For some reason my chat just died.:S
<sub06905> dis music
<Bronysith> LunarSS: fallout 1 i have sunk in 30 hours and still see no ending in sight
<cowvarkian> I playd fallout 3 for like, 300 hours...
<Bronysith> LunarSS: in skyrim i sunk 6 hours and beat the story, so much bullshit
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: i mean just the story alone
<DrSteveSCARz> AJIsAwesome: Refresh?
<MASF123|> well ok I'm out.
<Vivix> I played skyrim for 80 hours without being halfway, didn't like the main story
<cowvarkian> there are side quests
<cowvarkian> thats why it isnt a linear game
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: MAIN STORY
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: main story
<Wrek> MASF123|: in a foul mood today are we?
<AJIsAwesome> DrSteveSCARz: It works now.
<Vivix> main story in fallout is abou 3 hours in speedplay
<DrSteveSCARz> cool
<LunarSS> Bronysith: you can easily play skyrim for over 100 hours, oblivions main story wasnt long at all
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: you get 100 hours from the MAIN story alone
<cachi01|phone> Main story was meh.....
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: IM NOT TALKING ABOUT SIDE QUIESTS
<cowvarkian> those kinds of games arent meatn for the main story man
<cowvarkian> >.>
<cowvarkian> bah, whatever
<cachi01|phone> But the side quests are AWESOME
<Kandarihu> Well, here's what I'm off to do
<Bronysith> LunarSS: are you kidding me? the skyrim story was so fucking short and easy
<MASF123|> Huh? Wrek no just tired. I was cursing at Gears3 a while back. :/
<Bronysith> LunarSS: not to mention its been done a trillion times
<MASF123|> however
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: the sidequests in games like elderscrolls are what make it that game
<LunarSS> Bronysith: same with oblivion
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: i cant believe i just read that
<cowvarkian> ok
<LunarSS> the main story is not the point
<cowvarkian> I meant the new ones
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: you dont go to a restaraunt and order a side dish
<Celes_Chere> Ping! *shakes fist*
<cachi01|phone> But in oblivion you just have.to jump to level up lol
<Vivix> The length of main quest can't really be said. The length of F1 mainquest can be done in 3-4 hours, F2 same if you're really good. Same with most old TESgames I figure
<cowvarkian> yeah I do, Bronysith
<Major> cowvarkian: don't feed him, he'll just get more annoying
<cowvarkian> oh, I like this
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: sure you might get more a side dish than the main course but the main course is what is supposed to appeal to you
<cowvarkian> it usually doesnt
<MASF123|> ok see you all I'm tearing up from all the yawning I'm doing.
<PillowPoni> Bye MASF123|. Sleep well.
<Bronysith> Saying that you are not supposed to play the story is fucking stupid
<Wrek> first join first served
<cowvarkian> the side dish is what makes it good, not the main course
<Wrek> MvM
<Ponies47> Night MASF123| sleep well :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> mind if i join Wrek ?
<Wrek> password is wrekisbestpony
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: when did I say that
<Bronysith> its like reading lord of the rings and someone says "you are not supposed to read the book. you are supposed to read fanfiction only"
<AJIsAwesome> MASF123|: Night!
<Vivix> cowvarkian,in certain games yeah,
<Wrek> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: as i said
<DrSteveSCARz> i keep thinkin im getting steam messages :D
*Bronysith glomps TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Wrek> first join first served
<Buytoast> what's the server address?
<DrSteveSCARz> but im not
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: I said that the side quests are what fill the game, and make it whole
<MASF123|> buy PillowPoni who was the only one to say farewell apparently.
<MASF123|> by
<DrSteveSCARz> can i join?
<cowvarkian> not the main quest
<Ponies47> Wrek: Of coarse! That is the greatest password ever! XD
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: AKA FILLER
<MASF123|> bye
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: like in anime
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai Bronysith
<Kandarihu> Oh, sorry. Here's what I'm off to do now: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-cUyYVNqC8
*Celes_Chere wavs at TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Major> Wrek: Joining you now :3
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: how are you today?
*Celes_Chere *waves at TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Good and you Bronysith ?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai Celes_Chere
<DrSteveSCARz> Major: Whats the server name?
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: good, just playing final fantasy 8
<Celes_Chere> what is this wav I typed?
<Lil_B> wrek whats the PW of the server?
<Celes_Chere> *facepalm*
<alexxm> how you doing Celes_Chere
<Major> DrSteveSCARz: its Wreks server password is wrekisbestpony
<flutter_spin> hahahhaa. Guess what I found? http://corpseruncomics.com/corpse-run-196-diligence/
<Celes_Chere> alexxm: Good, and you?
<sagas> now lets not have everybody rush to join Wrek at once
<Bronysith> neyayea
<DrSteveSCARz> Major: The name is wreks server
<PillowPoni> Does EVERYBODY in the world have a TF2 server?
<Major> DrSteveSCARz: *shrugs* You just join him
<alexxm> i'm good Celes_Chere
<cowvarkian> so, Bronysith you would rather have an elder scrolls, or fallout game with no side quests?
<cowvarkian> no guilds?
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: never said that, but filler isnt what is supposed to make a game
<cowvarkian> no daedric quests?
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: :D
<flutter_spin> oh look. Stream, huh
<DrSteveSCARz> i cant find it
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: you did say that
<IshDepressedPony> greetings everyone
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: thats like having a soda with 75% foam is not very appealing
<Lil_B> hi IshDepressedPony
<LunarSS> Bronysith: but the whole point of TES games is the HUGE world to explore and tons of stuff to do
<Bronysith> LunarSS: not much to do in skyrim
<DrSteveSCARz> Wrek: Whats the server name?
<Bronysith> except wander and kill shit
<cowvarkian> so, you're saying that the side quests, the guilds, the daedric quests, and so on, are foam?
<Vivix> The thing is Bronysith, that the main quest in F1 F2 and probably MO and Oblivion too are no lengthier than the ones in Skyrim, so that's not where you shoudl compare them.
<cades> i think you broke the game :P
<Vivix> Skyrim mainquest is really bug though-
<Bronysith> in morrowind there was a huge backstory to everything, lots of lore
<LunarSS> Bronysith: then you havn't play that much of it because there is a shit ton to do
<Bronysith> LunarSS: not really
<Wrek> i enjoy fallout more than TES
<sagas> nice silenced sniper rifle Wrek
<Bronysith> Wrek: THANK YOU
<Lil_B> I heard that Syrims Main Quest ends rather underwhelming
<Vivix> I need to change the colours on this chat, I'm so used to webclient
<sagas> whats TES?
<Vivix> The elder scrolls,
<alexxm> does anyone else hear ping noises
<DrSteveSCARz> oh cant join its full :(
<Alister> sagas: Teh Elder Scrolls
<sagas> ah
<Bronysith> HERE IS SKYRIMS STORY IN NUTSHELL "you are the chosen one now go kill this dragon"
<Alister> The*
<LunarSS> Bronysith: i do too but saying there isnt much is skyrim is wrong
<cowvarkian> I enjoy fallout too, but I just like the quest choices in elder scrolls...
<Bronysith> bullshit
<Vivix> Wrek I agree, personally
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: havent seent hat rifle before. new?
<sagas> I do enjoy Fallout more than TES
<Alister> ^
<sagas> as well
<Bronysith> Fallout 1 is amazing, new vegas is FANTASTIC i love both of them
<AJIsAwesome> So many pings.
<Eulshy> so much annoying ping
<Celes_Chere> pingpingpongping
<Buytoast> what's all this bitching about fallouts?
<Vivix> NV main story is pretty bad, but the game is great
<Bronysith> in morrowind i feel like i actually get shit done and feel accomplished, in skyrim everything is just handed to you
<Dark_Horst> sagas: to be fair, fallout was wuite the unique game, especially in style. tes is just.... fnatasy. like you find it everywhere
<Vivix> and--the interaction in main story is great
<Dark_Horst> it also helps thatn there is a lot less post apocalypse on the gaming market than fanatasy
<Bronysith> Vivix: the side quests from the other factions integrate into the main story for the final battle for hoover dam which was genius
<cowvarkian> I like the actual backstory of elder scrolls
<sagas> ever' day im head shottin
<PillowPoni> Dem headshots.
<Bronysith> Vivix: cause everything had to deal with the endgame
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Good morning \:D/
<Vivix> Bronysith true, but I felt the story was less--compelling than F3, but that the atmosphere and feel was better
*Bronysith glomps SuperBrony64
<sagas> JARATE AWAY!
*Lil_B hugs SuperBrony64
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Hello!
<PillowPoni> Good evening SuperBrony64! *hugs and gives him a baby Discord*
<Vivix> Sorry if I miss any pings, but I'm still configuring this
<Bronysith> Vivix: yup, i love the faction system and hardcore mode, New Vegas is definetely the better game but 3 was better story and liam neeson lol
*SuperBrony64 hugs Bronysith, Lil_B, and PillowPoni back :D
<cowvarkian> I like new vegas' over arching story that is within the DLC...
*SuperBrony64 plays with the baby Discord :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02PillowPoni: What happened to the filly Trixie? ;~;
<Wrek> what i love about vegas is the diversity of the main story
<Ponies47> Morning SuperBrony64! :D
<Lil_B> well... I am on the server, but only spectator :/
<Wrek> and how all the side quests affect the overall main ending
<Wrek> obsidian did a fantastic job with NV
<PillowPoni> SuperBrony64: I still have the filly Trixie j;
<cowvarkian> mhmm
<AJIsAwesome> Where's the demoman?
*PillowPoni gives SuperBrony64 the filly Trixie
<sagas> why is Wrek taking damage?
<Wrek> and the DLC of NV was top notch
<Wrek> specially lonesome road
<Buytoast> Living is suffering.
<Celes_Chere> Image links are okay during stream, right? (I just got done re-reading the rules)
<Bronysith> Wrek: dead money was a bitch to my itch
<sagas> I liked F3 DLC more than NV
<cowvarkian> I only did it because of the gold and holorifle
<Rex_Mundi> Is sumica still the streamer?
<PillowPoni> Celes_Chere: Image links are fine
<Vivix> Wrek That's very true, I enjoyed eh Big Empty alot, a bit buggy, but I loved it
<Celes_Chere> Sweet
*SuperBrony64 plays Sorcerer's Apprentice with the filly Trixie and baby Discord :D
<Celes_Chere> Then come on over and look at this: http://fav.me/d5cfmas
<Vivix> I just felt you have less relation to the character motivatoin in NV than F3, but otherwise they're pretty much equal on story
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai Ponies47 :D
<oni_link> Woot Woot MvM!!! Afternoon eveyone! :)
<Ponies47> Hey oni_link!
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: Hello!
<thelonepony> hai oni_link
*oni_link glomps Ponies47
<Ponies47> Pringles are good :3
*Ponies47 Hugs oni_link back
<alexxm> how are things oni_link
<Wrek> most of NV's bugs were sorted ratehr rapid
<Lil_B> hi there oni_link :)
<Bronysith> but of course when comparing the fallout series to skyrim...Fallout series wins
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome and the lonepony: Hi!
<Wrek> and sicne it is in fact the oblivion engine
<Eulshy> Damn snipers are badas
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: I'm eating some now.:D
<Wrek> bugs here and there are to be expected
<oni_link> good alexxm ! What about you?
<Wrek> skyrim is way buggier than NV to me
<oni_link> and hi Lil_B ! :)
<Vivix> Wrek yeah, and most bugs were fixable on the computer
<alexxm> i'm good oni_link
<Bronysith> Wrek: skyrim is the daedric king of bugs
<Vivix> Wrek My friend wasn't able to complete end of Skyrim because of massive bugs that made enemies immortal
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: Me to! What flavor? O.O
<Rex_Mundi> Vivix: What? Fallout 3 had a railroading story that was full of holes. NV had a strong story.
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Sour Cream.
<oni_link> Dat ED face
<PillowPoni> Dat Ed
<Rex_Mundi> What is the song/band that is doing this music?
<sagas> im loving that Ed spray
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi, well- true, but I felt more for the character motivatoin from the instant beginning, it was easier to replay while roleplaying and such. I have played far more of NV though-
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: I'm eating the Original :3
<Lil_B> yeah... Skyrim has the same Engine as Oblivion (I think it's Gamebryo) but for some reason they won't admit it
<Wrek> OK, i need to sacrifice myself to the purifier, instead of letting my super mutant companion whom survives radiation go in
<Wrek> SEEM LEGIT
*Vivix trying desperately to turn on pings for Hydrairc and make chat easie to read. CTCP ping is that the one?
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: I have Barbecue but I don't feel like getting up.:D
<oni_link> alexxm: good to hear, my laptop had crashed last night and apparantly its all okay now :)
<Spectrum_Rush> speaking of ed faces http://derpiboo.ru/82664?scope=scpe9d7820e52af9d62b465ad3aea22338185bc5c415
<Wrek> but i did liek FO3's settign a bit more than NV's
<Vivix> Wrek I didn't have that companion, and I sent in that paladin girl
<Rex_Mundi> Whose this band?
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: I stick with the Original :P
<Buytoast> haha, everyone is gettin pissed at square enix
<Vivix> But yeah, I like NV's fele, I love that game
<oni_link> Spectrum_Rush: hahaha :D
<Buytoast> this is beautiful
<oni_link> Buytoast: how come?
<Wrek> TIRED OS ASKING WREK WHAT MUSIC HE PLAYS? GET SPOTIFY TODAY AND SUBSCRIBE TO HIS MEGAMETALIST!
<oni_link> ^
<Buytoast> they've had this countdown going down for some time now
<Vivix> Wrek! Turn on those spotify rooms and let people join
<Vivix> wait..then they would hear double music
<Buytoast> people thought it was for a the world ends with you sequel
<Buytoast> and were getting super hyped
<LunarSS> if only spotify was in canada
<Rex_Mundi> I diddnt think Fo3 had much roleplay or replayability to be honest.
<Buytoast> turns out it's just some andriod port of the world ends with you
<Buytoast> not a sequel
<Bronysith> i just am sick of how people say skyrim is the greatest game ever made and how it is "revolutionary" have they even played morrowind?
<Celes_Chere> And that makes me mad >:(
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi hm, well- each to their own. I prefer playing new invented characters in NV, but I like growing up in F3, in fact I loved growing up so much that I probably love the story because of that
<sagas> Jarating a machine? Whats that gonna do? :D
<Buytoast> and now everyone is bitching everywhere and getting ass shattered
<Bronysith> sagas: make criticals
<Dark_Horst> the problem i had with NV was that it missed the athmosphere that 3 had. too much western, not enough fallout
<Wrek> ^
<sagas> time to upgrade my piss in a bottle....
<Wrek> but the thign i love about NV is how they make deathclaws actualyl live up to the name
<Vivix> Mm, yes, but I felt the western was a bit justified by the locatoin and how--fake las vegas is, but I dunno, I kinda agree
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: your rig must be pretty good not getting any lag when the tank explodes
<Vivix> Death Claw and Wanamingo should be the scariest shit you ever meet
<Wrek> best armor in the game and explosive roudns with the AMR, and still then they pose a challenge
<Vivix> Someone ping me?
<Dark_Horst> thogh, contentwise NV was an upgrade
<Dark_Horst> with then loadingbench and ALL THOSE GUNS!
<Rex_Mundi> Vivix: The very begining of Fallout 3 is the strongest, its just that the game gets weakers as the story goes on. The most fun to be had in FO3 is to mindlessly exploar rather than than go straight to megaton. But as you gain levels and ecome familiar with the wastland and realize the stupid things about the setting, it saps the fun out of the game for me.
<Vivix> Agreed yeah
<Wrek> im hoping fallout 4: Boston takes the atmosphere and settingish of FO3 and the gameplay and story mehcanics of F:NV
<sagas> Rex_Mundi: stupid things?
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi, I kinda have to agree with you, I tend to avoid BoS and the ending as hard as I can when messing around. And I have the most fun that way-
<Vivix> Oh hell yeah Wrek,
<Lil_B> I'm sick of people who call themself hardcore gamers and hove nothing on their PC except Bethesda or Blizzard games ... I just think trying out a variaty of different games is somthing notmuch people do
<Vivix> Also, ping did not work.. how do I enable that on HydraIRC?
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: there's a fallout 4 in the works? :O
<Wrek> yes
<oni_link> Buytoast: Im well aware of Morrowind and Oblivion but Skyrim is the first Elder Scrolls game I actually owned.
<Dark_Horst> holy shit you got me excited now
<Buytoast> i aint said shit son
<Eli> good night guys
<PillowPoni> Night, Eli
<Vivix> I am terrified of F4 rumours, but I am so god damn excited
<Lil_B> good night Eli :(
<oni_link> Buytoast: and I dont hype it up. Alot of the fans get annoying though
<RaveBrony> Needed some good music to listen. Sees Wrek streaming. Problem solved :D
<Ponies47> Night Eli
<RaveBrony> *listen to
<oni_link> Night Eli
<AJIsAwesome> Eli: Night!
<alexxm> bye Eli
<Rex_Mundi> sagas: You know, the prewar tents that are still up 200 years after the nuclear war, one has a working computer terminal in it. That sort of stuff. there is a TON of stupid things about FO3. How about all the working lights in the Metros and desolated buildings? magic electricity?
<oni_link> Aw, I wanna play MvM :(
<Buytoast> oni_link, what in the hell are you tellin me this for
<Rustymeat> dat g3.5 scootaloo
<dr-whooves> HAY GUYZ@!!!!@!#!#
<Buytoast> i ain't said shit about skyrim
<dr-whooves> MvM?
<sagas> Rex_Mundi: Magic?.....
<RaveBrony> Dat sniper :o
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi, yeah, and I really disliked BoS direction and that optimus prime robot-
<Bronysith> but of course, games are never going to get better cause the greatest game of all time "final fantasy 6, 7 and chrono trigger" have all been made
<Vivix> Remember that the nuclear physics of Fallout is based on the 50s glorified view of the future
<oni_link> Buytoast: cause of what you said earlier. Im just putting my two cents in on the matter. I had to step away to help my folks update Netflix in the living room
<Dark_Horst> Rex_Mundi: the working tech gets pretty much explained by vault tech and their obsession with building things robust. what got me more was the 200 year old salisbury steak
<RaveBrony> Dat sniper again o_o
<Rex_Mundi> sagas: how ells do you explain the working power in that game?
<Rustymeat> lol
<LunarSS> Bronysith: dat super closed mindedness
<Buytoast> what, about the world ends with you oni_link?
<sagas> Rex_Mundi: Magic?......
<Wrek> though i did hate how NV did with the BoS
<Bronysith> LunarSS: twas a joke
<Vivix> the working power is the remnants of nuclear, but there's a bit too much power
<Wrek> after FO3 they were kidna the good guys
<Wrek> after NV
<Wrek> i feel like sidign with the enclave 24/7
<Lil_B> well, Mother 3 is only 6 years old, and there are many good games OUTSIDE of the RPG World
<Bronysith> LunarSS: just with the disapointment skyrim
<Vivix> In F1 they're half evil, they don't give a shit about you, and I like that
<oni_link> dr-whooves: yeah
<Bronysith> LunarSS: and how most games are catering towards casuals piss me off
<LunarSS> Bronysith: alright, but a lot of people really think that
<Buytoast> but casuals have the money
<Buytoast> and money talks
<Buytoast> you're just an elitist
<Rex_Mundi> @Wrek- oh hey, we were talking about your artwork earlier, yur Sumica OC is <3. And I fell in love with Fluttershy once because of your drawing.
<Spectrum_Rush> damn stairs http://derpiboo.ru/83454
<Wrek> <3
<cachi01|mobile> Confound this stairs
<Buytoast> inb4 bomb blows up
<Bronysith> Buytoast: what? cause i love a good actual challenge in games?
<oni_link> hahahaha Spectrum_Rush
<Lil_B> isn't Twilight able to teleport?
<Buytoast> well duh
<RaveBrony> Spectrum_Rush: Hahaha, thats great :D
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: well, the brotherhood of steel are pretty much greedy assholes. the chapter in FO3 was an exception becasue their elder was such a nice guy
<AJIsAwesome> Spectrum_Rush: :D
<oni_link> This is getting me in the mood to play some TF2
<Buytoast> obviously if you like challenge you spend all your time hunched around your computer/CALLADOODIE machine and don't bathe or shower
<Lil_B> the feel when you get kicketbout of the Spectators because of your inactivity . _ .
<Buytoast> the clean cut modern and mature gamer has time for other things
<Rex_Mundi> The Brotherhood in FNV is how the Brotherhood should be.
<oni_link> DAT CALLADOODIE
<sagas> shoot the white thing!
<cachi01|mobile> Lil_B lol
<Vivix> Brotherhood only stand for tech, never helping, or even attacking civilians, but the BOS in Fo3 is an offshoot group that refuse to neglect helping hte civilians
<Dark_Horst> and how it was in FO2 and before
<Vivix> Dark_Horst yeah- BoS are bastards, most of the time
<Vivix> Someone ping me again?
<oni_link> Wrek: dat $666
<Dumori> BoS aren't bastards they are just detached as fuck
<cachi01|mobile> EVIIIÑ
<cachi01|mobile> L
<cachi01|mobile> DAMMIT
<Dark_Horst> Dumori: they wouldnt hesitate to smoke a vault if it meant getting the hardware in it. i think it even happened somewhere before FO3
<Vivix> Yeah, I think so
<sagas> upgrade your piss Wrek!
<Dumori> Depends on the chapter
<Dumori> only Vault I knwo fo being cracked for tech was via enclave
<Vivix> F3 cracked a vault yes
<Vivix> which is..weird
<Dumori> BoS have hit abandoned vaults
<Dumori> Was it one still active?
<Vivix> but BoS- haven't they attacked civilians in F1?
<oni_link> who here wants to get a lobby going in TF2?
<oni_link> dat KING PINKIE :o
<PillowPoni> Dat King
<Rex_Mundi> James (Your dad) was a bit of an idiot in FO3. Autome had a really good plan to help the wastland if you think about it. Eden is the one that wanted to poison the water, Autumn wanted to rebuild America. Too bad you werent given a choice in the matter, your railroaded into helping Lyons BOS. Stupid Bethesda derps too much:P
<Vivix> Dumori I think Enclave attacks Vault 101 in F3-
<Dumori> Enclave attack vault 15 in fo2
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6536387072
<Bronysith> Vault 69 had 999 women and 1 man
<Rex_Mundi> @Wrek- <3<3<3
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi,yes, not being able to choose sides is really annoying, but I did help Eden, because at the time I played the "Vault kid who thinks mutie are zombies" role
<Dark_Horst> Rex_Mundi: you could side with eden by using the anti-mutagen he offers. kills of almost the entire wasteland
<BronyInstrumental> hello everypony :)
<oni_link> BronyInstrumental: those damn spiders :[
<Vivix> F3 hit some canon faults
<BronyInstrumental> oni_link: ...wut?
<oni_link> tab fail i meant Bronysith
<sagas> dem crits
<sagas> over 900 each hit
<Rex_Mundi> Dark_Horst: But who besides a socialpath would do that (since your effected too)
<PillowPoni> Hi BronyInstrumental
<oni_link> sorry BronyInstrumental hello by the way :D
<Dark_Horst> Rex_Mundi: vivix did^^
<Ponies47> Hey BronyInstrumental
<Vivix> Hehe, I did- but I was playing a role-
<ArcherJoe11> Dumori: I thought they attacked Vault 13. with the smart Deathclaws
<Vivix> also, ping still won't ping me
<Dumori> ArcherJoe11 in part
<Dark_Horst> is that korpiklaani? ?
<Vivix> I think Enclave attacked Vault 13?
<Vivix> thought*
<oni_link> Vivix: are you using a separate IRC client or the website?
<sagas> dat swing speed
<Vivix> seperate, first time running it
<RaveBrony> Inded
<RaveBrony> *Indeed
<sagas> throw more jarate
<PillowPoni> Dat wrecking
<Rex_Mundi> Is fallout equestria more like FO3, or more like NV and the classic games?
<Dumorimasoddaa> You might need to explore settings
<sagas> Rex_Mundi: both
<Dark_Horst> Rex_Mundi: it starts out very FO3
<Vivix> Fe is like a blend, KKat has played all the games
<oni_link> Vivix: yeah you probably have to enable sounds
<Dumorimasoddaa> And find the highlight options Vivix
<Chrysalis> missed 1 bundle :(
<Vivix> theres a tiny bit of Wasteland references too
*Vivix tries
<Vivix> Should I eh.. try to enable CTCP ping or..like a script?
<Wrek> brb
<Dark_Horst> Rex_Mundi: but it also takes ideas from new vegas. and developes into something own later on
<Major> Aw we almost had a perfect game :(
<Dumorimasoddaa> I need to replay wasteland.
<Bronysith> Major: and you lost
<oni_link> Vivix: tbh I dont know
<Vivix> Yeah, FoE becomes its own thing, really nice story and different enough to be exciting
<Major> Bronysith: eh, I dont really care :P
<Bronysith> Major: doesnt matter you lost i won
<Rex_Mundi> Does anypony here know anything about that Fallout Equestria game being made?
<oni_link> Anyone here wanna get a TF2 game going?
<Major> Bronysith: what exactly? You won nothing :P
<Bronysith> Major: yes i did actually
<Bronysith> Major: winner got gloating rights for eternity
<Vivix> Any HydraIrc users here?
<Major> Bronysith: then that just makes you more of a asshat
<Bronysith> Vivix: i do but not ATM
<Dark_Horst> Rex_Mundi: i know that they're still looking for people. it'S going to be a full conversion of the fallout 3 engine. own story, own items, own maps
<Bronysith> Major: *an
<BronyInstrumental> why does everyone wanna play TF2 when i'm on my crappy-ass laptop? :<
<Vivix> Bronysith I'm trying to enable ping- just as the webclient, but I can't figure it out
<Bronysith> Vivix: cant help you there lol
<Vivix> Damn-
<Lil_B> well, I'm gone , good night everyone!
<Bronysith> BronyInstrumental: get off your crappy ass laptop
<Vivix> Goodnight Lil_B
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: night
<BronyInstrumental> bai Lil_B
<oni_link> BronyInstrumental: There was no way of me knowing :( I would have been on sooner if that was the case
<PillowPoni> Night Lil_B
<oni_link> also night Lil_B
*Lil_B hugs Vivix Dark_Horst BronyInstrumental PillowPoni and oni_link ;)
<AjIsAwesome> Lil_B: Night!
<BronyInstrumental> oni_link: yeah, i woulda been able to play like an hour ago :(
<Lil_B> and AjIsAwesome :)
<oni_link> BronyInstrumental: aw. well how about later today?
<Bronysith> i broke the private
<Ponies47> Night Lil.....
<BronyInstrumental> oni_link: it's half past 10 at night, and i'm on a laptop until thursday XD
<PillowPoni> Dat Scootaloo
<oni_link> BronyInstrumental: ahh how come??
<Bronysith> Wrek: http://cheezburger.com/6532268800
<BronyInstrumental> oni_link: in MY house all i have is my laptop. every thursday and saturday (sometimes sunday, I.E today) i visit my dad. he has a fast-running desktop :P
<oni_link> DAT BEAR SNIPER
<Vivix> Someone ping me?
*Vivix nags
<BronyInstrumental> and then there was silence
<oni_link> BronyInstrumental: oh makes sense. My laptop sucks but one of the few games I can run on it is TF2. Im saving up for a decent AMD X4 Kit for around 300 USD. 400 total cost when I buy the graphics card, an HD 5870 at 2GB
<Bronysith> BronyInstrumental: did you know that drowing and forgiveness sounds the same?
<Bronysith> drowning
<BronyInstrumental> Bronysith: no i didn't. did you know that if i cared i would care?
<Bronysith> BronyInstrumental: screaming and then silence
<Bronysith> thats hte sound of forgiveness and drowning
<oni_link> ...
<AjIsAwesome> Is the stream working for anyone?
<oni_link> AjIsAwesome: yeah
<PillowPoni> AjIsAwesome: It's working fine for me
<oni_link> you might have to refresh
<AjIsAwesome> Maybe it's my internet. The stream won't load everytime I refresh.
<oni_link> :(
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: forgiveness doesnt necessarily end in silence
<WallDives> ohai BState.
<oni_link> hi WallDives
<PillowPoni> ohai WallDives
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi WallDives
<DrSteveSCARz> hi WallDives
<Rex_Mundi> So yeah, is Fallout 4 really going to be set in Boston? that will be awsome, im from Massachusetts and seeing NewEngland americana will be sweet, id love to see a lighthouse, and the accents, and the landscape. I freaking love it.
<Vivix> Wrek, Fallout 4 in boston is confirmed?
<MadSurge> Dem posters :D
<Ponies47> Hye WallDives
<Colt_magnum> wrek!!
<Ponies47> *Hey
<Wrek> bethesdas fallout team has been active in that area gatehrign research
<oni_link> MadSurge: IKR
<TheKatPony> hello bronystate. whos streaming
<Wrek> and in game stuff points at it
<Vivix> OOOhhh, nice.
<PillowPoni> Hello, TheKatPony
<MadSurge> TheKatPony: Wrek is!
<TheKatPony> ooo
<Vivix> I'm excited now, I've never been there, but Rex_Mundi 's mentioning of LIGHTHOUSES made me excited
<alexxm> are ping noise on
<TheKoreanBrony1354> hey everypony iam back
<WallDives> find out alexxm.
<oni_link> hello TheKoreanBrony1354
<oni_link> wb
<Rex_Mundi> Cool. if rural massachusetts is in, then there will be lots of Trees, rocks, amd little stone walls everywhere! lets hope they learned how to make a proper fallout game from Obsidion.
<TheKatPony> Welcone back.
<alexxm> so whos winning Wrek
<TheKoreanBrony1354> probaly
<Vivix> Yeah, I hope so. In F2 it was clear that forests existed- F3 kinda derped on that and made it out to be a legend
*Ponies47 Pokes the chat
<TheKatPony> ow.
*Vivix watches the chat fall
<oni_link> Wrek is a scary good sniper O,o
<Rex_Mundi> Vivix: Yeah, it would be cool. New England Americana would be very awsome. I hope we see salty fisher folk (and fish and chips), Beer, trees, accents, boats, Universities, hilly rural communities filled with trees. That kind of stuff.
<BronyInstrumental> yeah, me and sub06905 were playing today, i sniped but was nowhere near as good as Wrek :D
<Wrek> fallout X: sweden
<Wrek> killer moose everywhere
<RaveBrony> :D
<Bronysith> Wrek: shut up and take my money?
<oni_link> BronyInstrumental: I'd hate to be on the receiving end of his shots...
<Vivix> Oh man- That sounds really nice
<Vivix> I'd love to see fallout europe, I'm not sure what fallout said happened to europe, but it is in the design bible
<Vivix> should be able to read it on Wikia
<AJIsAwesome> Back. Just had to restart my computer.
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: wb
<Spectrum_Rush> >_><_<>_><_< http://derpiboo.ru/83087
<Bronysith> okay... FINAL FANTASY 8 takes the cake for best opener in final fantasy
<TheKatPony> welcome back
<Vivix> TestV test
<TestV> Vivix Test
<BronyInstrumental> oni_link: yeah. people don't exactly laugh at me while sniping but they have a chance to do something, unlike when wrek is sniping :D
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<RaveBrony> Hey Meanwhile!
<DrSteveSCARz> Hey Meanwhile
<TheKatPony> hey Meanwhile
<Bronysith> hi there Meanwhile
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Hello!
*Bronysith gives Meanwhile a box
<BronyInstrumental> ohai Meanwhile
<oni_link> BronyInstrumental: I hope to never go against Wrek then D:
<DrSteveSCARz> lol, i just found wreks server, now i wait
<Colt_magnum> Check yoself b4 you wrek yoself
<alexxm> how you doing Meanwhile
<oni_link> :D
<TestV> Vivix
<TestV> Vivix:
<Meanwhile> alexxm: Eh, GW2 crashed on me again, figure I'd take a break.
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Rex_Mundi> Another possibilty, Fallout Hawaii maybe? Although I think the United states ownership of hawaii is illegal based on USAs own laws, until the monarchy is restored and a deal is made to make the annextion legal.
<Vivix> Ah
<RaveBrony> Dat moving to the beat :D
<AJIsAwesome> Dat Sniper headbang.
<TheKatPony> Are you dancing Wrek?
<Vivix> I would love to see--Fallout expand
<RaveBrony> Looks like it, lol
<Vivix> but I would..prefer to see it done by the people who made the lore, you know?
<Meanwhile> Sniper induced motion sickness.
<Vivix> Because F3- even if I loved it, it kinda feels like fanfiction
<RaveBrony> Engie! Y u no press F4!?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> whos pinging!?
<cachi01|mobile> BRB playing Gravity Rush
<Rex_Mundi> Vivix: So... Obsideon than.
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: wut?
<PillowPoni> Dat Wrek lolol
<TheKatPony> It's on the stream, so whenever someone types Wrek you'll here it
<Vivix> Yeah, Obsidion and maybe some Brian Fargo involvement, but- I take what I can get with joy!
<Vivix> Obsidian*
<oni_link> TheKoreanBrony1354: probably Wrek I think he has IRC on the website in the background
<TheKatPony> Yep ^^
<Rex_Mundi> Well, not everything, for me. Mothership Zeta is a joke.
<Vivix> Yes
<Vivix> Mothership Zeta is like that bridge of Death in F2, not even possibly semi miniscule canon
<Unnr> ...
<Eulshy> I like the end of mothership zeta, We get to be all star trek
<Unnr> Veggie55 is going on indefinite hiatus
<Wrek> motehrship zeta was a fun DLC
<Vivix> I've never played it, actually, but it just can't be canon
<Wrek> but i didnt care for it story wise and fallout could have noe without
<Eulshy> Full power to the forward sheilds!
<Rex_Mundi> Still, doesnt make it a good DLC. FO3s good DLCs are The Pitt and Point Lookout.
<Vivix> yeah, it's like those jokes in F2
<Meanwhile> Never really liked Fallout.
<Eulshy> Point look out was stupid
<TheKatPony> ^^
<Vivix> The Pitt and Point Lookout are what I bought yea, I didn't quite enjoy--the mutants in Point Lookout (consider, super mutants are..very special, what happened to the swampfolk?)
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: understandable
<Bronysith> HOW DID THIS CONVERSATION START?!
<Meanwhile> It just doesn't interest me.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: what interests you?
<AJIsAwesome> I never was into the alien plot points in video games. It's overused and boring.
<Meanwhile> It's all very much grey surrounded by suoer mutants.
<Meanwhile> super*
*PillowPoni dances to the music
<DrSteveSCARz> i wanna join their game :(
<TheKatPony> AJIsAwesome: Same with me ^^
<Rex_Mundi> They show that bethesda are better at creating their own stories rather than rehashing Fo1 and Fo2 story in an unsatisfactory manner (and that is what the main Quest in FO3 was)
<Unnr> Rex_Mundi: Except the small, tiny, insignifigant detail that the main quest in FO3 was so far from the FO1 and 2 mould that it was silly
<Vivix> Fo3 had issues in canon, consider how weak jet and other drugs are, how mild the world is, and how trees don't exist- Moriartys accent and 3-Dogs accent?
<RaveBrony> :o
<Vivix> I really enjoyed Fo3, but I did close my eyes to some things, and some things--just bugged me with the canon
<DrSteveSCARz> brb everypony gotta fry sum fishies, want any?
<Rex_Mundi> 3-Dog has an accent? Moriarty proves that there are more advanced parts of the east coast than the CW that has ships (the only way the capital wastland makes sence in any way is if its just a backwater that the surrounding areas spit on)
<PillowPoni> DrSteveSCARz: What kind of fish is it?
<DoPoniPoni> How do you get that sniper from the pyro update
<Vivix> Could be- but Moriartys accent is from a country that vanished 250 so years ago
<RaveBrony> This song! :o
<DrSteveSCARz> PillowPoni: Tilapia
<Vivix> 3Dog just felt a bit too modern-
<Vivix> and a lot of his things like "I was doing jet at the time"
<PillowPoni> DrSteveSCARz: OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOD---
<Vivix> Jet is not--weak, it's like crystal meth, the people who use it in F2 are --they can't even talk
<Michael> hai everypony, how you doing? :)
<PillowPoni> DrSteveSCARz: I LOVE Tilapia
<DrSteveSCARz> PillowPoni: Ikr
<Vivix> It just bugs me
<AJIsAwesome> Michael: Hello!
<PillowPoni> Hey Michael
<TheKatPony> God, I haven't eaten all day :|
<TheKatPony> Hey Michael
<Meanwhile> Ded.
<Dovah> TheKatPony: then go get food?
<thelonepony> hai Micheal
<TheKatPony> Dovah: I have no food :(
*Michael hugs AJIsAwesome PillowPoni TheKatPony thelonepony
<Rex_Mundi> heh, I dont think the Irish will ever dissapear! Like the mormons. As for Jet, my head canon says its just a catchall term for a number of different substances. Thats how Jet exists in so many different places.
<Dovah> TheKatPony: do you have pet?
<PillowPoni> Niece is asleep early and house is clean. Wat do.
<TheKatPony> Dovah: .....no..... >_>
<AJIsAwesome> TheKatPony: Grocery store?
<AJIsAwesome> PillowPoni: Watch ponies?
<PillowPoni> AJIsAwesome: But stream is on.
<Vivix> yeah, but Jet was created by mobsters in New Reno, it's a brandname, so to speak- I bet it is a weaker watered out variant, but- it's just too weak and easy to use in F3
<Dovah> TheKatPony: be a pony and eat the ground!
<TheKatPony> PillowPoni: Then watch the stream :)
<Rex_Mundi> Items in general in fallout 3 are too week and too comon, you can find drugs and grenades and stuff in mailboxes. LAME
<PillowPoni> TheKatPony: I am :3
<Vivix> Truee, and I mean what- I payed over 1000 caps for Stimpak in F2, and I think I only got..3
<Vivix> in F3 they're cheap as crazy
<Michael> Rex_Mundi: grenades and ammo on mailbox: fallout logic
<Vivix> All modern bethesda game has the autoloot fail
<Rex_Mundi> Im still trying to wrap my head around how someone put a baseball bat in a mailbox.
<TheKatPony> Well, shit. I'm just gonna go get food. See you all later.
<PillowPoni> Bye TheKatPony
<Dark_Horst> Rex_Mundi: that's the charme and hilariousness of post-war paranoia^^
<Vivix> it makes places like The Glow uninteresting- the glow was amazing because of the weird loot
<Vivix> Hehe, and a CRUTCH in the mailbox as well
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: That's easy. Break the bat into pieces and put it in the mailbox.
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: what's the glow?
<Rex_Mundi> I can also use one tire iron to repaire another tire iron.
<Vivix> The Glow is a --secret military base in F1 that was hit dead on by a nuke
<Vivix> It's almost impossible to reach without good preperation, and has really cool lore and loot
<Wrek> thoguh iirc, i liekd how repair worked beter in FO3
<Vivix> When I went there the first time as a kid it was like D=...."This is the most amazing thing EVER!" and--I died 2 weeks later of radiation poisining in the desert
<Wrek> in NV iw as as logn as you had the same type of wep you can repair to max condition
<Wrek> correct me if im wrong
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: it was
<Colt_magnum> Whos streaming?
<Rex_Mundi> But it was expensive in FONV, plus high level guns are rare.
<Vivix> yyes, but skill raised how effective. F3 capped you so you could not repair to max without skill,
<Colt_magnum> I keep hearing his pings
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: but i liked the repair sets. beats running around to find exactly that same weapon
<Wrek> yes
<Colt_magnum> Wrek: ping?
<Wrek> ping
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: correction: smae type of weapon only worked if you had the jury-rigging perk
<Vivix> in FNV?
<Dark_Horst> yes
<Vivix> I think I did it--without it?
<Rex_Mundi> Im still in love with Wreks artwork. Dat Sumica pony.<3
<Metronome> ^ U guys talking about FoNV?
<Vivix> yeah, among other fallouts
<Michael> yes
<Wrek> nah in NV jury rigging is only to help you make special ammo
<Wrek> basically
<Eulshy> Fallout 3 and New vegas are too easy
<Wrek> depedns on hwo you play
<Wrek> atleast when it comes to NV
<Vivix> I like playing in a way--I'm constantly poor and dying, I love it
<Eulshy> I've played hardcore mode
<Michael> Eulshy: play it in hard
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: i remmebr erepairing weapons only with the exact same weapons. and then repair kits. the jury rigging perk enables you to repair same weapon groups. like, pistols with pistols, no matter if 9 or 12,7mm
<Wrek> Eulshy: hardcore mode isnt to make it hard
<Eulshy> It's still not hard
<Wrek> its to make ir slightly more realistic and gettign you to actualyl drink and eat and sleep
<Wrek> nothing else
<Vivix> Dark_Horst, oh yes, that sounds abot right
<Eulshy> I've played in hard
<Vivix> I play in Normal with Hardcore, and I think it's just the right amount of hard for my playstyle
<Eulshy> on hardcore mode, there, more description
<Eulshy> in hrd
<Eulshy> hard*
<Michael> i loved hardcore, for realism
<Vivix> I kinda wish radiation was a bit scarier in F3 and FNV
<HoodyNinja> SO INTENSE!
<Vivix> but yeah-
<Wrek> everytiem i got back to FO3 i say "but wheres hardcore?"
<HoodyNinja> Hello Bronystate people
<BaconMane> 0,5HARD CORE
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: Hello!
<Vivix> Wrek yeah- that and iron sights
<Michael> ohai HoodyNinja
<BaconMane> 0,5Ill give you a hard core~
<Eulshy> Vivix, lol you used to get radiation and die
<PillowPoni> Hi HoodyNinja! Long time no see! *hugs*
<AJIsAwesome> BaconMane: Hey, BaconMane!
<PillowPoni> Hey BaconMane
<HoodyNinja> PillowPoni: I was on last night :'(
<Vivix> Yeah, but you could die like weeks later in F1 and 2, if you weren't attentive
<Vivix> I kinda miss that lingering threat
<PillowPoni> PillowPoni: I didn't see you on last night.
<Vivix> well, if you constntly got small amounts and sickness
<Michael> ohai BaconMane
<PillowPoni> Maybe you were lurking or I wasn't paying attention.
<oni_link> stupid crAPPLE... I want my desktop already, this damn thing's wireless card always fails on me and when it does, it freezes the system.
<AJIsAwesome> PillowPoni: Did you just message yourself by accident?
<HoodyNinja> Sniper is best melee class
<PillowPoni> AJIsAwesome: Oh god yes I did.
<Michael> lol wrek goes melee with sniper
*PillowPoni facefloors
<Dark_Horst> cant really decide on the radiatiion in fallout 3. on one side, it was a little too common and shrug-offable. on the other hand, it kinda fit the whole exaggerated setting of FO3, being so accustomed to radiation that it'S a background nusiance
<Michael> brb
<Rex_Mundi> My friend in MIT in Boston says that Bethesda people have been researching Boston. Awe yeah, this will be cool.:D
<Michael> back
<HoodyNinja> It got quiet or my chat crashed
<Vivix> Dark_Horst, yeah, that's true- and it was hit extra hard.
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: Nope.
<HoodyNinja> AJIsAwesome: Yay :)
<Wrek> what i missed of radiation in FNV was the mutations
<HoodyNinja> Ugh, I should be cleaning house, but i don't feel like it
<Wrek> also
<Vivix> I don't know the lore on mutations very well
<Wrek> VATS is for pussies
<Vivix> but Super Mutants are not mutated from radiation
<Michael> ^^
<Vivix> they were made before the war
<oni_link> well I guess I'll play some TF2 multiplayer because I can't host apparantly and because I can't find more people to play MvM with
<Vivix> around 2070's
<HoodyNinja> ^ What Wrek said
<Rex_Mundi> FEV virus made them
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> in The Glow and Mariposa
<Vivix> Woops
<Eulshy> I'm out of Mann up mode Tickets
<Eulshy> I should go trade for some
*HoodyNinja backs up his tumbleweed truck
<Rex_Mundi> You thinkthey will ever go back for a western style game? maybe Fallout 5 or whatever will be in Texas. Imagine the mexican bandito raiders!:D
<CrimsonPhoenix> I finished Twilight vs walking
<CrimsonPhoenix> ...dat ending
<Vivix> Hehehe
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: How was it?
<oni_link> steam ID _oni_link_ in case you guys wanna play something. I ll be on later, bye and thanks Wrek for streaming :)
<Michael> all the jarate
<CrimsonPhoenix> creepy?
<PillowPoni> Bye oni_link
<DrSteveSCARz> bye oni_link
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: Bye!
<Michael> bye oni_link
<Metronome> How long did u take to walk down those stairs?
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Why?
<Vivix> I wish they would make one fallout with the masive worldmap and big cities again
<oni_link> :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, you gotta play it to see it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Metronome, quite a while
<Eulshy> Rex_Mundi, fallout was never in texas
<CrimsonPhoenix> haven't taken note on time
<CrimsonPhoenix> but less than an hour for sure
<Eulshy> Nor will it ever be like that
<Metronome> I took me 5 min:$
<CrimsonPhoenix> maybe you were lucky enough
<Vivix> I think F1 had some texas
<Metronome> *It
<Eulshy> No it didn't Vivix
<Rex_Mundi> Eulshy: Yeah, thats why it would be a cool idea. NV was western in that it was in Nervada.
<Vivix> Where did it cut off?
<MadSurge> I gotta go to bed guys :( Goodnight!
<PillowPoni> Bye MadSurge *hugglies*
<thelonepony> night MadSurge
<DrSteveSCARz> see ya MadSurge
<Michael> bye MadSurge
<Eulshy> Well the fact that texas is way to south
<MadSurge> Bye bye!
<Eulshy> Where most of the storires have taken place around california, except for 3
<Vivix> Oh yeah, Fallout yeah, had to relook the maps
<Michael> dat "tank"
<Metronome> Chat is mad Quiet:S
<Rex_Mundi> Eulshy: What about it? I suppose the deep south could work for a setting. Fallout New Orleans... In anycase, id prefere Boston (New England is BEST ENGLAND!:P
<Michael> yeah Metronome
<Vivix> Hehe, F4 sounds like it will be awesome
<Vivix> and I really hope they hit the story right, and atmosphere
<Vivix> If they don't include hardcore and ironsights however- they will just be ignoring NV's improvements-
<Michael> all the sprays
<Eulshy> Meh, Fallout will always take place near the original source
<Vivix> probably, yeah. The references in their storybook thing design thing... mentions europe and what places were hit etc, but I doubt it will be made into a game
<Rex_Mundi> I really hope Bethesda learned from Obsidian, I dont want them to Ruin the Boston location, what the did in FO3 (with the Railroad and androids) was preety effing horrible.
<Vivix> Some of the robots bugged me a lot
<Eulshy> Rex, botson is already ruined
<Vivix> All the F robots have that--they kinda make sense, you know? But bipedal robots? Bipedal giant robots? In what possible world would that make sense?
<Michael> Vivix: dont search logic in fallout
<Eulshy> Vivix, the fictional ones they exist in
<Rex_Mundi> I was talking about the selfaware humanoid ones i that Rivet city quest, just terrible.
<Vivix> but the fictoinal world of fallout makes that giant make even less sense
<Vivix> Oh those enclave androids? Yeah I hope they drop that
<Rex_Mundi> Commonwealth androids
<Vivix> I don't really want--them to expand on that Enclave thing either, but where is Boston compared to that rumoured enclave location?
<Vivix> yeah, that's the name
<Rex_Mundi> Vivix: The rumoured Enclave location is in Chicago
*Vivix tries to do mental map
<Eulshy> Vivix, the Enclave has the robots down already
<Michael> Vivix: mental map of what?
<Rex_Mundi> Boston-New England (the north east). Chicago- the midwest
*Polydunami yawns
<Wrek> commonwealth is boston
<Vivix> now I'm worried
<HoodyNinja> Vivix: You should only be worried if you are on fire
<Rex_Mundi> More like the commonwealth is Fallouts equivelent of MIT
<Polydunami> It's 1521 here in Vancouver and I'm already sleepy :P
<Wrek> amd MIT is where?
<Ponies47> my comptuer is bucking up. brb gonna do a restart
<Wrek> exactly
<Rex_Mundi> I forget
<Vivix> massachusets
*Vivix spellpowers , GO
<Wrek> and where is boston?
<Vivix> Well, if they make it work, I'll enjoy it
<Vivix> same place
<Rex_Mundi> Boston is like, one of the most important american cities, 2nd to new york on the east coast
<Vivix> We will probably never see the inside of NCR
<Metronome> Random underrated art http://tridgeon.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4v9gwc
<Vivix> The only thing that worries me about Commonwealth is that- android thing makes me envision like a glowing bubled city with flying cars- but I really hope that's not it
<AJIsAwesome> Metronome: Nice.
<Eulshy> Vivix, thats funny
<Michael> Metronome: wow :o
<Eulshy> and no it isn't
<Polydunami> Whoa, Metronome. You wouldn't find that out of place in a museum :O
<Rex_Mundi> Massachusetts has some of the most prestigous schools in the USA, has a well funded public schol system, and an important technology deloper of the USA, no dough there will be lots of SCIENCE! in Fallout 4.
<creeperhugger10> who is playing?
<Polydunami> Well, art museun, but STILL
<Polydunami> *museum :S
<Vivix> Well, it probably won't be, but we won't know until the result is clear. Bethesda has only made one fallou game, so they still have to prove themselves
<Metronome> People like him should have gotten a lot of attention :/
<Michael> Metronome: agreed
<creeperhugger10> who is playing
<Eulshy> Vivix, they have made 2
<Vivix> no
<Michael> wrek is playing
<Vivix> They have made one
<Eulshy> vivix, which one?
<Vivix> Bethesda was not involved in fallout new vegas
<BaconMane> 0,5http://i.imgur.com/DqDrd.png
<Vivix> They gave the license to remnants of Black Isle, Obsidian, and gave them engine and freedom
<thelonepony> Bethesda publish FNV
<Polydunami> SO FABULOUS LC xD
<Meanwhile> BaconMane: That's horrifying.
<Rex_Mundi> I have to leave now, see you later *hugs all*
*Vivix waves
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Bye!
<Eulshy> So Vivix, you say bethesda had nothing to do with fallout 3
<HoodyNinja> Bai Rex_Mundi
<thelonepony> bye Rex_Mundi
<Metronome> Baconmane: Is that you?
<BaconMane> 0,5D:
<BaconMane> 0,5no
<Metronome> -_(\ sry
<HoodyNinja> BaconMane Could never look that creepy!
<Michael> bye Rex_Mundi
<Meanwhile> BaconMane always looks that creepy.
<Vivix> Eulshy, nooo that's the compelte opposite of what I am saying. They made F3, but did not make FNV
<PillowPoni> BaconMane: Well, there goes sleep. Totally didn't need it.
<Polydunami> Huh? Which one is Forrest Gump? :S
<Polydunami> Wait never mind he's on the other team :P
<Polydunami> Wait my bad, looked at the bg colour :S
<HoodyNinja> bewm
<Meanwhile> Polydunami: He's the engi.
<Spectrum_Rush> not sure if photoshop fail, or spawn from hell...
<HoodyNinja> I need to re download TF2 now
<sub06905> :3
<Polydunami> My dog is visibly aged ._.
<PillowPoni> Spectrum_Rush: Why not both?
<AJIsAwesome> I haven't seen anyone use Demoman on this stream....
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, lounge it up
<PillowPoni> And classy as fuck music
<Metronome> :D FoNW music
<Colt_magnum> Loving this playlist
<Meanwhile> http://derpy.me/UJb4T
<Colt_magnum> MOAR NV music Wrek!
<Metronome> *V
<PillowPoni> Meanwhile: Oh god.
<Michael> Meanwhile: dat fail
<HoodyNinja> Meanwhile: Well okay then
<Metronome> Wait is that a new meme?
<Cypresswolf> :D I love how these old songs are specifically remembered via video games
<Buytoast> oh boy, now people are going to start overusing that face now
<Buytoast> fun
<Vivix> Oh god Meanwhile I saw that on ECMajor's blog. Such a horrible restoration
<Polydunami> Wait what face?
<Spademagnes[R]> I know this isnt from that, but I instantly think Fallout with this music
<Buytoast> some stupid fucker botched up a restoration of an old picture in a church or something
<Dovah> Spademagnes[R]: prolly cuz wrek plays this music when he plays nv
<Buytoast> so instead of jesus it looks like some inbred monkey
<Meanwhile> Aye, some old lady decided to try and restore a painting of Christ. Said old lady had /no/ experience working with paintings whatsoever.
<Spademagnes[R]> Dovah: Well this music is a track in the game itself
<Major> Vivix: dat ping :P
<Meanwhile> And yeah, the painting now looks like a howler monkey with a neckbeard.
<Dovah> Spademagnes[R]: 0.o
<PillowPoni> Meanwhile: *laughs*
<Polydunami> Now this is dissonance at its finest :D
<Colt_magnum> BIG IIRROOOONN!! BIG IRRROOOOOOOOONNN!!
<Cypresswolf> makes me feel old - having listened to several of these classics via golden oldies radio :P
<Spademagnes[R]> So just how much of this party is made of Bronystate members?
<Michael> Meanwhile: his name is Cecilia jimenez
<Colt_magnum> hey Spademagnes[R] gj on that fluttervideo
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]:Probably all of them.
<HoodyNinja> Spademagnes[R]: I think all of them
<Michael> hai Spademagnes[R]
<Vivix> Major ;__;?
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: Probably all of them.
<Major> Vivix: you pinged me when you were talking about that EOCMajor :P
<Vivix> Ooh, hehehe
<Spademagnes[R]> More Fallout music! (even though thats not where its from)
<Vivix> Big Iron on his hip?
<Vordox> YES
<Vordox> I GOT PSO2 WORKING!
<otakon> I see we're watching Wrek wreck TF2 MvM
<Cypresswolf> I need to find a musical note pin for my Uncle's funeral - other than jewelery stores, where can I specifically find that pin?
<Spademagnes[R]> Sniper doesnt seem like a good class to use in this mode
<Ponies47> Ok I'm back. There the glitch I was having went away
<otakon> Cypresswolf: Ebay, amazon
<derpyface> why are we watching tf2?
<Meanwhile> otakon: If you mean "Watch wrek miss most of his shots and then pull out the piss jar" yes.
<HoodyNinja> Spademagnes[R]: Wrek seems to disagree
<derpyface> Hello everpony
<Michael> ohai Ponies47
<Metronome> http://www.acountrypriest.com/2012/08/25/ Not sure if source :/

<JRP> SuperBrony64: but

<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: I actually never see Demoman on MvM. I wonder why.....

<JRP> :3
<AJIsAwesome> Is Demoman useful in MvM?
<Spademagnes[R]> Look at that health bar go
<DrSteveSCARz> AJIsAwesome: VERY
<Spademagnes[R]> So why the hell is Demoman hardly seen here?
<PillowPoni> Paintchat works? Yay
<DrSteveSCARz> Beats me, i only use denoman or soldier in MvM
<StupidSexyCJ> hmm, links borked
<Spademagnes[R]> Awsome dash face
<Phase4> 00,02AJIsAwesome, if your good with stickies you can do as much damage as a sentry
<Meanwhile> Phase4: you're*
<RaveBrony> This song <3
<TheKatPony> oh no
<Malk> JINGLE JANGLE
<AJIsAwesome> Phase4: Cool! I just don't see a lot of people use Demoman.
<thelonepony> JIngle jangle
<Michael> dat music, ideal for kill
<Malk> Demoman is a fun class AJIsAwesome
<PillowPoni> I think I heard this song on the radio the other day.
<Vivix> Paintchat only works to some people, and noone really knows why- it seems?
<Polydunami> Don't see much romance between Dash and Sonic, to be honest :P
<Vivix> It used to work for almost everyone before htough
<thelonepony> chat derp on me
<StupidSexyCJ> Vivix: strange
*PillowPoni is downloading Java
<HoodyNinja> Vivix: Celestia hates us
<pyrocatboy> Hello everypony!
<PillowPoni> Hi pyrocatboy
<thelonepony> hai pyrocatboy
<AJIsAwesome> pyrocatboy: Hello!
<HoodyNinja> Ello pyrocatboy
<Michael> ohai pyrocatboy
<Bronysith> im probably really slow poke on this. but joshscorcher is a brony? awesome lol
<Vivix> I'm able to get in via Phase's link- but yeah
<StupidSexyCJ> Vivix: his link don't work for me
<sagas>
<Vivix> I remember, for a while I had to use IE, because chrome would break Paintchat, but then IE broke it, and after that only his link has worked for me-
<Vivix> It's like- Java is alive, and is sick of me bugging it so it crawls away
<Dovah> why the hell can i never find anything i need on minecraft? first no slime, then no desert, now no wolves... wtf... -_-
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: I wouldn't jump to conclusions. It's best to wait until he says that he is.
<Spademagnes[R]> That Ed face
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: he reviews episodes
<Spademagnes[R]> What
<PillowPoni> Dat Fluttershy :3
<Buytoast> all dat money
<Malk> Color chat works I just cant log in
<Buytoast> all that loss
<AJIsAwesome> Does money carry over in MvM?
<sagas> why is the paint chat always empty
<Buytoast> yes
<Buytoast> but only if you get it
<Dovah> .
<StupidSexyCJ> Vivix: i'll try IE
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: Thanks.
<Michael> lovely music
<Buytoast> well, not from game to game
<Spademagnes[R]> Use IE? HAH
<Buytoast> but wave to wave
<Spademagnes[R]> Use IE for stuff... thats a good one
<Michael> Spademagnes[R]: dat is blasphemy
<Reikim> Out of curiosity
<Reikim> Will Steam ever actually mail me?
<Reikim> As in, physically?
<Wrek> and that
<Wrek> is why
<Wrek> you play as sniper
<Wrek> on MvM
<MelaPonie> minecraft!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Malk> LOL im only one in paint chat
<RaveBrony> Not sure
<Reikim> Because I don't think they do, and yet they ask for address and so on.
<Meanwhile> Will they physically mail you.
<Spademagnes[R]> What exactly did you do
<Iwa> Bronysith: Mind you, reviewing episodes of shows, does not mean you are a fan or follower of that show or its community... :S
<Vivix> IE pony is crying, she's trying as hard as she can ;__;
<Reikim> ...
<Wrek> 3 shotted the super heavy
<Reikim> You know what I mean.
<Meanwhile> I don't know, but they've mailed me and I've been using it for years.
<Wrek> 900 dmg each
<Bronysith> Iwa: but if he hated it, why bother reviewing it?
<PillowPoni> Malk: I plan on getting on PaintChat, as soon as Java finishes installing
<Reikim> They've mailed you?
<Spademagnes[R]> You sure? Everyone was shooting him
<Colt_magnum> T_T Gawd I love this song. I can just imagine me sitting at a porch as an old man with my mrs.
<Dovah> MelaPonie: make minecraft stop being an ass and let me find stuff..
<Meanwhile> Pardon me there's a word missing there.
<MelaPonie> <3 minecraft!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Colt_magnum> And Im not even married lol
<Meanwhile> never*
<Reikim> Or was there supposed to be a never in there yeah I though so.
<Malk> PillowPoni cool im gonna draw
<RaveBrony> Why is my TF2 failing to launch :(
<Polydunami> Can't really have "Use and IE" in the same sentence... unless it's "IE is of no use" :3
<PillowPoni> Malk: Sweet
<Reikim> Because hl2.exe is notorioously bad about that.
<Reikim> That or it's updating.
<Iwa> Bronysith: Well, I personally think he started reviewing it due to being curious why others do enojy it
<PillowPoni> Polydunami: Or it's "Use IE to download [different browser of your choice]"
<Spademagnes[R]> The fact my school computer has IE on it as its main browser angers me
<RaveBrony> Ah, there we go.
<RaveBrony> Just took awhile O_o
<Polydunami> That, too :P
<PillowPoni> Dat zoom, Wrek
<Meanwhile> Preparing to launch.
<Reikim> So basically, unless you start screwing around with them, Steam isn't ever going to actually contact you besides the occasional e-mail.
<Meanwhile> Still preparing to launch.
<DrSteveSCARz> Spademagnes[R]: my school lets us change it to chrome
<otakon> FULL POWER!
<kirzstryfe> I think they need the info in case there's an issue with your credit card, verification and such
<Vivix> I use IE when everything else breaks, and vice versa
<HoodyNinja> I use FireFox
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<Polydunami> ^
<Vivix> I mainly use Chrome
<DrSteveSCARz> Google Chrome FTW
<Reikim> Aha.
<thelonepony> chrome
<Meanwhile> kirz, what you playing on GW2?
<Reikim> Well it's a prepaid one, so whatever, shouldn't have an issue.
<Michael> firefox!
<otakon> SOMEONE GET THE MOOLAH!
<PillowPoni> I switch between Chrome and Firefox
<RaveBrony> Same
<PillowPoni> ohay otakon *hugs*
<sagas> Chrome is where its at
<DrSteveSCARz> firefox pissed me off with its constant updates
<otakon> hiya PillowPoni
<kirzstryfe> yeah
<Michael> ohai otakon
<PillowPoni> otakon: How are you?
<kirzstryfe> oh, Ranger
<Bronysith> Iwa: and he just referenced luna in a non pony reviewing episode
<Meanwhile> Has yours crashed yet?
<Reikim> Oh yeah, I'm working on getting a copy of GW2.
<otakon> PillowPoni: okay except for a tornado moving through the area
<Wrek> still doubt me Spademagnes[R] ?
<otakon> hiya Michael
<otakon> NO ONE PICKED UP THE MOOLAH!
<PillowPoni> otakon: Oh gosh that's not good
<kirzstryfe> has a couple of times
<Michael> i have to recognise that i'm only for Fallout music
<Spademagnes[R]> Well...not really
<Iwa> Bronysith: Really? *burns hand wrap* Excellent...
<HoodyNinja> I feel like a dick because I have no problems
<RaveBrony> I would like to try GW2, im a WoW man, but with the next expansion, i will no longer be one :D
<Bronysith> Iwa: yup, we need more bronies like him lol
<Meanwhile> Mine's doing it like every hour. I think it's an issue with my graphic drivers but the ones it recommends me are in like, beta and don't install properly.
<DrSteveSCARz> Michael: I prefer BFBC2 Vietnam music
<Reikim> I have a friend who once got hooked on WoW.
<Spademagnes[R]> So what is better? Chrome or firefox?
<DrSteveSCARz> Spademagnes[R]: Chrome
<Azura_2ndClassNoob> I'd go with Chrome
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Like who?
<thelonepony> chrome
<Iwa> Bronysith: Agreed... Maybe John Bain... Gna gna
<Michael> DrSteveSCARz: yeah, but this bring me back memories
<PillowPoni> Why is Java blocking the paintchat? It says that Chrome blocked it because it's out of date, and I JUST installed the recent version.
<Spademagnes[R]> Stop wasting ammo
<HoodyNinja> Isnt that an opiniated question?
<DrSteveSCARz> Michael: Tru
<AJIsAwesome> They're both equal, IMO.
<Bronysith> Iwa: what about yahtzee from zero punctuation?
<Reikim> As in, hardcore addiction.
<Bronysith> oh wait he is
<Reikim> Now he plays LoL.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: is yahtzee of course
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/gkKjs.png
<Meanwhile> I played WoW for 5 years.
<RaveBrony> Oh man, i cant play LoL
<Spademagnes[R]> More fallout music!
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: What crap again?
<RaveBrony> Ive been playing WoW since Vanilla
<Meanwhile> Cba to continue with Mists.
<thelonepony> Jonhy guitar
<kirzstryfe> played WoW, not a fan of it any more
<Michael> dat recharge
<RaveBrony> I would LOVE to kill Garrosh in the next expansion!! but..i just cant afford it, lol
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: he means TF2
<Meanwhile> As it stands my Nord Warrior in GW2 is already fairly interesting, if a bit flimsy.
*pyrocatboy mauls Meanwhile with a badger
<Vivix> PillowPoni, you could try pinging phase, he's the current kindamod on paintchat, and has a fair amount of knowledge of code I think
<JappleAck> hay everypony, i'm back
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Ok.
<kirzstryfe> warrior =/= tank
<DrSteveSCARz> hey JappleAck
<AJIsAwesome> JappleAck: Hello!
<kirzstryfe> :P
<Michael> hai JappleAck
<otakon> wb JappleAck
<HoodyNinja> Hi JappleAck
<PillowPoni> Vivix: i clicked on the link he put in the chat
<thelonepony> hai JappleAck
<Meanwhile> Nothing particularly seems to = tank at the moment.
<superretroworld> hey JappleAck
<kirzstryfe> I think the guardian may be the closest thing in the game, if you have a shield
<Reikim> I think
<DrSteveSCARz> Nice save Wrek
<Meanwhile> I have a shield damnit.
<PillowPoni> Hey JappleAck
<Vivix> PillowPoni, how about the normal link? The signed is if your java is blocking permission of some kind-
<Reikim> GW2 seems to be avoiding typical class roles.
<Vivix> I think-
*Vivix has no idea
<Polydunami> Oh hey JappleAck :3
<Reikim> For example, the rather frightening lack of healers.
<kirzstryfe> it's more "keep your own ass alive"
<Meanwhile> Yeah, it doesn't have any particular archetype.
<JappleAck> i haven't been on Bronystate for week. :(
<kirzstryfe> works fairly well so far though
<DrSteveSCARz> O_O
<Polydunami> Oh my
<JappleAck> who is streaming
<kirzstryfe> ran into one of the big area bosses earlier, about 5 levels too low, that was fun :)
<thelonepony> love this song!
<DrSteveSCARz> JappleAck: Wrek
<Bronysith> otakon: have you seen the fiery jokers top ten video game endings?
<Meanwhile> Agreed, and tbh I have been spending most of my time with mobs that are out of my weight class.
<Polydunami> This song again :D
<Polydunami> Wait, never mind
*pyrocatboy mauls Bronysith with a badger
<PillowPoni> Vivix: Just tried the regular link on the Bronystate page. Still says that Java was blocked because it is out of date
<PillowPoni> Fuck you Java. Fuck you.
<JRP> SuperBrony64: bla bla bla
<Bronysith> PillowPoni: woudlnt that hurt?
<Reikim> Oughta join up
<Reikim> Does it have a decent story at least?
<Reikim> That was my other problem with MMOs.
*Spademagnes[R] flips a table
<Vivix> PillowPoni, try it in a different browser. Chrome ruined Paintchat to me randomly
*HoodyNinja puts table upright
<PillowPoni> Bronysith: Not really.
*Michael sits on table
<Vivix> It works in Chrome to me noow, with JRE7, but not before then
<PillowPoni> Vivix:I got in yaaaay
<Malk> Vivix im using chrome and your in there
<Meanwhile> Story is apparently different based on some multi choice questions in character creation.
<Bronysith> Liberai futera
<Vivix> Yeah, I'm using Chrome with JRE7
<Spademagnes[R]> WHY
*DrSteveSCARz kicks table back over
<RaveBrony> O.o
<kirzstryfe> yep
<Meanwhile> Well, personal story anyway.
<Spademagnes[R]> That pic!
*HoodyNinja puts table in the incenerator
<RaveBrony> Whats the main purpose of GW?
<StinkomanFan> NOTHING CAN STOP THE SCOOTS
<Spademagnes[R]> Wrek: Stop wasting ammo that angers me
<Reikim> I always have issues finding the motivation in an MMO.
<Malk> You gotta allow Java allways for the site so it will work
<RaveBrony> Like, what are you after?
<Bronysith> liberi fatali, the opening song to final fantasy 8, so fucking epic
<kirzstryfe> one sec, this'll take a minute
<Reikim> Especially when all the quests start becoming "Go here, kill this many of this mob, collect this many of this drop"
*Michael leaves table
<Azura_2ndClassNoob> Spademagnes[R] he can get it back easily, so keep ur pants on
*Bronysith glomps otakon with a table
<Colt_magnum> lol heartaches by teh numbuhs
*Colt_magnum hums along
<Meanwhile> Tbh there aren't many /quests/. Most of the stuff is area specific.
<Reikim> No fluid integration of story and mechanics.
<Phase4> berrypunch, y u offline
<Polydunami> Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec
*Famicom waves to all of ponychat
<Spademagnes[R]> Why is all this music playing the same tracks from Fallout?
<AJIsAwesome> Famicom: Hello!
<Reikim> She passed out. Too much punch.
*Michael waves to Famicom "hello"
<Meanwhile> If you are within a certain area for example you will be alerted to things occuring in it and encouraged to contribute.
<Famicom> tiem to party pinkie pie stylez http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3eNjiFQxRVA/TqCngWWO_6I/AAAAAAAAPBk/qDk3M4hf_UA/s1600/73911%2B-%2Bcupcake%2Bcute%2Bdiabetes%2Bpinkie_pie.png
<BronyInstrumental> well, imma sleep. bubye everyone :)
<thelonepony> ha yah Famicon
<Bronysith> Spademagnes[R]: you do know these songs originated waaaaay before fallout right?
<kirzstryfe> Guild Wars refers to a massive human war between ruling guilds, from just before the first game, and through the first game you were fulfilling the Flameseeker Prophecies (hence Prophecies for first campaign's name)
<Bronysith> night BronyInstrumental
<DrSteveSCARz> bye BronyInstrumental
*BronyInstrumental waves goodbye to all chat
<AJIsAwesome> BronyInstrumental: Night!
<Spademagnes[R]> Bronysith: Yea I know but thats where I heard these from
<Michael> BronyInstrumental: Gnight
<Reikim> Ah, that's a bit better way of doing an MMO "world"
<Famicom> bai BronyInstrumental
<Bronysith> Spademagnes[R]: okay, cause so many people i met that are like "that song is from fallout" no, the song is in fallout, NOT FROM FALLOUT
<AJIsAwesome> Am I the only one who doesn't like the Pony Rock?
<kirzstryfe> 2nd was a civil war in the asia-equivalent continent, 3rd expansion was african setting, preventing the old god of chaos from reincarnating and destroying everything
<alexxm> bye BronyInstrumental
<Famicom> i havent connected to iris in ages i am suprised it remembered my nick
<DrSteveSCARz> AJIsAwesome: Pony Rock?
<Bronysith> i hate party rock anthem AJIsAwesome
<Reikim> Also, other bad thing: lack of bros to quest with. Which I will not be in short supply of, with you two.
<Meanwhile> Bandits are poisoning resovoirs or there's a giant ice worm harassing a lodge or there're precious items in a cave that neeed recovering.
<kirzstryfe> 4th you ended up in teh frozen north fighting something, didn't really pl.ay it so I'm not sure
<AJIsAwesome> The "Party Rock" theme ponified.
<HoodyNinja> AJIsAwesome: I feel they couldve done beter
<Famicom> are you talking about that ponified version of party rock anthem?
<DrSteveSCARz> AJIsAwesome: Well i hate Party Rock... so i guess i do
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: that party rock song is so fucking lame
<Famicom> that was horrible
<Meanwhile> Tbh I don't know jack about Guild Wars lore.
<AJIsAwesome> My school spammed that song to DEATH.
<Famicom> i like the orginial song
<Spademagnes[R]> Next round!
<sub06905> i liked party rock :<
<AJIsAwesome> THe Party ROck song.
<Reikim> I see Meanwhile's of the power gamer variety.
<Michael> Gnight everypony HF :)
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: You can if you want to.
<Famicom> but it did get old quick
<Wrek> well that was fun ^_^
<AJIsAwesome> Michael: Bye!
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: i hate it cause that band thinks they are on par with led zeppelin if not succeding them. FUCKING SMUG ASS PRICKS
<Meanwhile> WoW lore I am very well versed in however.
<Phase4> kirzstryfe, voive BerryPunch ?
*Famicom waves to berry
<DrSteveSCARz> aww man i wanted to play with ya
<Spademagnes[R]> Oh hi twilight
<JRP> I am a washing machine pony
<Phase4> thx
<HoodyNinja> Bronysith: Two totally different genres, cant compare the two
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Wait they think that they're equals with Led Zeppelin?:D
<kirzstryfe> In GW2, ancient elder dragons have just awakened, causing massive issues, and it's about the 5 races having to come together to stop them before they accomplish whatever it is they're trying to do
<RaveBrony> Yay!
<Spademagnes[R]> And hello newvegas
<sub06905> fallout tiem
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: yes, they say it in that fucking song
<HoodyNinja> Oooh, NV
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: *sigh*
<Spademagnes[R]> So a new game? or more exploring?
<Polydunami> I don't even know WHAT you guys are talking about :S
<Meanwhile> I never devoted as much time to the original GW as I did to WoW, so I haven't had the same motivation to research.
<kirzstryfe> but yeah, the game flow is done really well, haven't had to grind at all yet
<Major> Wrek: good game :)
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: Talking about Party ROck.
<HoodyNinja> Polydunami: Nobody does
<Bronysith> Major: biggest understatement of the day
<Chrysalis> Wrek thanks for teh game
<AJIsAwesome> *ROck*
<Colt_magnum> Do it Wrek!
<AJIsAwesome> *Rock*
<Colt_magnum> Wrek!
<AJIsAwesome> Stupid shift key.
<Colt_magnum> Tyranasaurus Wrek!
<Polydunami> Yeah, I don't even know what Party Rock is :S
<RaveBrony> Ah :o
<Spademagnes[R]> Wait who the hell said they were on par with Led Zeplin?
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: Don't bother. You don't want to know.
<Celes_Chere> pingpongpingityping
<Reikim> ELDER DRAGONS OF WRATH
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: They did.
<Meanwhile> If I have any complaints at the moment it's that there hasn't been much mention of the stats or what they actually do.
<HoodyNinja> Polydunami: Party Rock Anthem? Its a pretty popular song
<Spademagnes[R]> Who the hell do they think they are?
<RaveBrony> I have Loremaster in WoW, I love the story lines in games.
<Colt_magnum> T~T Its so beautiful
<kirzstryfe> the stat description is in the hero menu, Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> I've just been stacking power because it best translates to "Hit things harder"
<kirzstryfe> just hover over them
*Famicom loads up rhe X68000 version of Akamajou Dracula (Castlevania)
<Meanwhile> The more you know.
<Iwa> Contrast creating music, activate
<Meanwhile> RaveBrony: pre or post cata?
<AJIsAwesome> I was one of those kids who loved listening to this kind of music when I was very little.
<Celes_Chere> I think I need to watch Brother Bear again, this brings some awesome memories: http://fav.me/d5cmvse
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> thanks for the game Wrek ~
<sub06905> hmm... time to go play sum metroid prime :)
<StinkomanFan> BYE THAT CARD
<Reikim> Hm
<StinkomanFan> BUY THAT CARD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohh this place is alive
<Reikim> I wonder if some kind of hybrid class is viable.
<Spademagnes[R]> Rob everything
<StinkomanFan> Aw :(
<Famicom> my god konami's X68k music sounds amazing with GS midi
<Meanwhile> Define hybrid class.
<Reikim> Straight warriors or mages tend to get somewhat boring after a while.
<StinkomanFan> ...The hell's with her hat?
<Reikim> A class that focuses on more than one stat.
<Spademagnes[R]> Is her hat..clipping?
<kirzstryfe> probably
<kirzstryfe> haven't delved too much into stats yet, still only L16
<Polydunami> I don't know anyone who uses the word "hoser", Celes_Chere, and I live in Vancouver :P
<Meanwhile> Indeed, but the weapons range on each class is different and weapons define half of your ability bar.
<Reikim> For example, I'd like to do something more amusing than "dump into Strength, hit things repeatedly until they die"
<Famicom> i forgot that word existed
<HoodyNinja> Polydunami: Disney is racist, thats why
<sub06905|Gamecube> lol
*Spademagnes[R] turns on his Pipboy
<Unnr> Polydunami: That´s because the word was made up for SCTV
<Unnr> *nods*
<Polydunami> Oh yeah?
<Major> I love this song! <3
<HoodyNinja> I do!
<Iwa> Oooh, very fitting x3
<thelonepony> ^^
<Celes_Chere> Polydunami: Huh, didn't notice that one. I was mostly reffering to the mooses...moose...meese...whatever in the picture
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> gw2 talk ?
<kirzstryfe> yep
<Bronysith1> ERMAGHERD WHY FIERY JOKER WHY?!
<Bronysith1> you start every vid with that awesome song
<StinkomanFan> I always buy cards from merchants.... even though I'm TERRIBLE at Caravan
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'll sit down a pretend i know something about it :3
<Reikim> One of my other, many issues with MMOs.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and*
*Famicom glomps derpy
<Reikim> Gameplay can get boring.
<Bronysith1> i just kill people and take their money
<DerpyMuffins> Hi everypony I'm back
<Spademagnes[R]> I steal everything that isnt nailed down
<Major> I dont want to set world on fire... <3
<Bronysith> this song is so fucking nostalgic
<Spademagnes[R]> Even the nails
<Derpy_Hooves> why am i being glomped? ; ~;
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: Welcome back!
<Polydunami> I dare you to play Macarthur Park by Richard Harris to this game xD
<Celes_Chere> Disney! make it so...http://fav.me/d5cbdf5
<eyesfire2> i dont hunny
<Meanwhile> World vs World looks interesting but I have yet to have a look at it.
*Famicom goes to play some Akamajou Dracula in full screen
<kirzstryfe> I've heard WvW is good, but I didn't do much of it during beta
<kirzstryfe> I know Jim did
<Famicom> ill be AFPC
<Celes_Chere> Actually that would prolly be more Squeenix
<Bronysith> i remember when this song first came out 1941 <3
<Spademagnes[R]> Damn thats old
<Bronysith> yes
<Reikim> WvW?
<HoodyNinja> Spademagnes[R]: Even the tool you use to nail things to the floor, which is ironic because it isnt nailed down
<Reikim> Word vs. World?
<Bronysith> it was hot stuff Spademagnes[R]
<kirzstryfe> yeah
<Iwa> Celes_Chere: It's too cute D:
*Bronysith waiting
<HoodyNinja> Bronysith: You're that old?
*Celes_Chere is sorting through way too much art right now...
<Spademagnes[R]> So why is wrek dressed like a cowboy?
<HoodyNinja> Because cowboys are sexy
<kirzstryfe> most of the time when mmo's get boring, it's because you have to grind to level up
<Bronysith> Spademagnes[R]: why arent you dressed like a cowboy?
<kirzstryfe> which I haven't really seen so far
<Celes_Chere> Note to self: http://fav.me/d5ch6e4
<Bronysith> HoodyNinja: old what now?
<Ponies47> Becasue Wrek is Wrek and he will do what he wants Spademagnes[R] :P
<Colt_magnum> Nothing like the sound of gunfire in the soundtrack of a 60s metropolis area
<Spademagnes[R]> Didnt Cass die last time he played this?
<otakon> yes she did
<HoodyNinja> Bronysith: You said you remembered when that song came out, 1941, making you 71 years old
<Meanwhile> I'm trying to find out if using melee weapons on spellcaster classes actually translate to melee abilities, but the wiki is (Still) down and everywhere else is rather lacking.
<otakon> inb4 buttaze
<Bronysith> HoodyNinja: if i was born that year of course
<Spectrum_Rush> http://derpiboo.ru/images/83567 warning death may occur
<otakon> I know there is a cattleprod in this game
<Bronysith> HoodyNinja: but i wasnt born that year
<kirzstryfe> and they're on the ball so far, downtime on the first day it was open for head start was maybe 6 hours, and that only came once people started waking up, which is to be expected
<Colt_magnum> SHMAWZOW!
<Colt_magnum> POP right in the mouth!
<otakon> Spectrum_Rush: what are you talking about? it's just
<PillowPoni> otakon: Buttaze
*otakon looks at Derpy
<HoodyNinja> Bronysith: So, you are under 71 years of age?
*Bronysith shaves otakon s beard
<Colt_magnum> Wrek: Tyrannasaurus fidelis!
<otakon> HNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
*otakon falls over dead
<Spademagnes[R]> Awww
<Bronysith> HoodyNinja: what? i rermember when the song first came out, and you think i am younger than that?
<Bronysith> HoodyNinja: think about that for a moment
<Colt_magnum> DAYUUMM!
<Major> brb gonna grab me some HeadPhones
<kirzstryfe> bad thing is that all of the US servers were already showing high/full, with only 1 at medium capacity
*HoodyNinja hits otakon with chest paddles
<Bronysith> HoodyNinja: if i was younger than that i would not remember it first coming out
*Celes_Chere has experienced cute overload, looks for mortal kombat stuff
<kirzstryfe> so I really hope they're planning on opening a few more for launch
<otakon> *GASP*
<HoodyNinja> Bronysith: No im trying to... You know what, nvm
*otakon has been revived at half health
*Bronysith casts cure on otakon
*Discord *snapflash Revives otakon *snapflash
<otakon> Anyone got a health potion?
<Bronysith> otakon: i just cured you you bastard
<otakon> Bronysith: oh
*Bronysith casts ultima on otakon
<otakon> WAIT NO!
<Bronysith> otakon: PUNISHMENT
*otakon casts reflect on himself
<otakon> HA!
*Bronysith stops the rp by breaking the 4th wall
<Celes_Chere> well, that didn't work out too well: http://fav.me/d5cfmas ...mlp everywhere :)
*HoodyNinja fixes the 4th wall with a band-aid
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: You fool! You've killed us all!
*otakon looks at the fourth wall, in pieces and walks away...
<CrimsonPhoenix> WOAH That's a lot of RP
<PillowPoni> Dammit Bronysith: Do you know how much it costs to fix that thing?
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: Black ops has the greatest ending in video games...apparently
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: we are all ready doomed
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: How?
<Polydunami> Twiden and Flutterscorp? Oh my :O
*Celes_Chere fixes 4th wall, reinforces fifth
<CrimsonPhoenix> the first black ops?
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: i dont know, BRIBERY
<CrimsonPhoenix> what's the ending?
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: AMERICA FUC K YEA
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: thats literally all you need to know
<HoodyNinja> I enjoyes the Black Ops campaign
<HoodyNinja> enjoyed*
<CrimsonPhoenix> and in what game was the nuke thing?
<StinkomanFan> It was this moment that taught me to HATE Ceaser's Legion
<HoodyNinja> I think that was BF3?
<StinkomanFan> and to join the NCR just to SPITE THEM
<HoodyNinja> not sure
<Bronysith> I murdered the legion
<kirzstryfe> black ops ending wasn't exactly a surprise, and the sp was really short
<Spectrum_Rush> CrimsonPhoenix: cod4
<Reikim> ...I'm starting to realize, in retrospect, that trying to make this Companion Cube papercraft was a really bad idea.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yeah
<Bronysith> I KILLED CAESAR , and left his legion in ashes
<CrimsonPhoenix> COD4 is arguably the best
<Polydunami> So. Which Fallout? I'm clueless :S
<Spectrum_Rush> Polydunami: F:NV
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause I think that nuke was really unexpected
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: call of duty is just a horrible series
<DrSteveSCARz> Polydunami: New Vegas
<Polydunami> Oh yeah
<JESmith71> Hmmm...I wonder if MondoPony's Loyalty song will really get played on the radio. It's past the time it was supposed to and it hasn't yet
<Polydunami> ?
<Major> I love the music in this game and FO 3 :)
<DrSteveSCARz> Bronysith: Its not that bad
<AJIsAwesome> JESmith71: Radio?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, It became horrible
<Bronysith> DrSteveSCARz: it is the same game every year
<StinkomanFan> KILL VUPLES
<Derpy_Hooves> who's streaming? o 3o
<CrimsonPhoenix> as much as I hated the franchise even back then
<Derpy_Hooves> also hai gaiz :3
<StinkomanFan> BOOM HEADSHOT
<Bronysith> I tried marrying hte ink spots music...
<AJIsAwesome> It's the SAME FORMULA. How is that original?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can admit it was good for its time
<DrSteveSCARz> Bronysith: Tru, but i still like it, they add new improvements and features every game
<CrimsonPhoenix> and it did set the WWII theme in the mainstream
<Bronysith> DrSteveSCARz: OMG THE M16 IS GREY NOW INSTEAD OF BLACK
<Bronysith> Such an improvement
<CrimsonPhoenix> and made other companies grab a bite in the crowd
<HoodyNinja> CoD is addicting though, plus its fun to hear people whine online
<Bronysith> Call of duty is the bane of gaming
<CrimsonPhoenix> CoD was great back then but now it's a pile of cashcow
<Bronysith> besides skyrim
<Meanwhile> Why's that?
<DrSteveSCARz> Bronysith: Gun colors mean nothing, i wouldnt care if the m16 was pink
<Reikim> Chalk another one down for "Seemed like a good idea at the time!"
<JESmith71> AJIsAwesome: There was a report on some pony forums that some Brony was trying to get his uncle to play Loyalty on their radio station. It was supposed to play at 6:45 and it hasn't happend yet
<Reikim> It's too complicated and I don't have the time to make it work properly.
<Bronysith> DrSteveSCARz: dont you know that it is the same game every year with maybe 1 different perk each time
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: I have to agree. I was addicted to CoD (unfortunately), but I stopped when they kept recycling things.
<Reikim> And there are no bloody instructions.
<CrimsonPhoenix> It seems I've been ignored
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, have you read anything I said?
<Meanwhile> Helpful.
<DrSteveSCARz> Bronysith: I will admot COD isnt that much of a great series, but its entertaining enough for me
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: I heard you. Just replying to another comment.
<Major> Yay~
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: the last good CoD was WaW
<Major> Love this song too
<CrimsonPhoenix> I could agree on that
<HoodyNinja> Bo2 is trying to make the series look less bad, they actually are changing some things
<thelonepony> ^
<Spademagnes[R]> Why the hell is CoD so "popular" then?
<Bronysith> Major: if you said you liked the songs from fallout, then this would apply to it
<Polydunami> Kids :P
<Major> Magic
<Reikim> Luckily, the universe has screwed me over often enough that I always have a PLan B.
<Spectrum_Rush> 12 year olds is why
<CrimsonPhoenix> Spademagnes[R], it simulated WW2
<Reikim> *Plan B
<DerpyMuffins> Its for all consoles
<Bronysith> Fallout 1 is an incredible game
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: Becuase it's supposed to be "cool" and "manly".

<Bronysith> HOW MUCH I COULD KILL STUFF
<Bronysith> I COULD KILL EVERYTHING?!
<Bronysith> so awesome
<Major> Bronysith: I dont LIKE the songs, I LOVE them
<Spectrum_Rush> dat it is Bronysith
<Spademagnes[R]> CoD looks so boring
<Spademagnes[R]> I tried it once... never got into it
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: It is when you keep playing it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Spademagnes[R], which one?
<CrimsonPhoenix> MW2?
<Bronysith> Spectrum_Rush: i mean, killing anything i want WITH consequences
<CrimsonPhoenix> no wonder
<DrSteveSCARz> Spademagnes[R]: You need to have your mind set on "this is going to be a great game" the you'll like it
<Major> COD Should have made another WW2 game, not the shitty future setting
<otakon> weather is getting really bad here
<Bronysith> Spectrum_Rush: you kill a kid and you are labeled a child killer
<Spademagnes[R]> I think... 4... I forget
<TheKatPony> hey again everyone. Wrek still streaming?
<Spectrum_Rush> Bronysith: and no essential characters that cant die, iirc
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: I tried playing it again a couplr weeks ago. Got bored and quit during the middle of the game and haven't touche dit since.
<DrSteveSCARz> Major: they made enough ww2 game
<Bronysith> Spectrum_Rush: and you can KILLA NNOYING BRATS
<otakon> TheKatPony: eeyup
<Bronysith> Spectrum_Rush: cause this was before butthurt soccer moms were in the equation
<otakon> I might go offline because of this nasty weather all
<Bronysith> otakon: tell wrek to stop thundering around outside then
<DerpyMuffins> What is Wrek doing?
<Spademagnes[R]> So who is the actual good guys in New Vegas?
<otakon> brb looking outside
<Bronysith> Spademagnes[R]: no one
<Major> DrSteveSCARz: well they are pros with WW2 and thats why they should have stayed there, ethier that or a WW1 game
<TheKatPony> what the hell is he doing
<otakon> Spademagnes[R]: The Followers of the Apocalypse
<StinkomanFan> ...I just realized that the Ceaser's Legion all wear dresses.
<Bronysith> Major: a world war 1 game would be boring
<Meanwhile> Plan B in this case being?
<Bronysith> sit in trenches all day long
<VenHur> I'm back everypony.
<Bronysith> slowly starving to death
<otakon> Shoot, reload, shoot, reload
<Bronysith> get sick
<Reikim> Draw an epic drawing of the TARDIS.
<DerpyMuffins> Hi HenHur
<TheKatPony> welcome back
<Bronysith> take a shit
<otakon> dig trench
<DrSteveSCARz> Major: They could do a WWI game, a Korea game, or another Vietnam game
<Polydunami> I'll be back later; gonna take a nap -_-
<Spectrum_Rush> Bronysith: shitting your pants in feear
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Welcome back!
<otakon> dig trench
<Bronysith> DIE OF DYSENTERY
<DerpyMuffins> VenHur
<JESmith71> I'm going to keep the radio station's live stream open for a while to see if they are playing loyalty
<Spademagnes[R]> If CoD does the same shit all the time, why the fuck does it keep selling?
<Meanwhile> Well ok then.
<otakon> Spademagnes[R]: idiots keep buying it
<DrSteveSCARz> Spademagnes[R]: Cause ppl are stupid
<Bronysith> Spademagnes[R]: false gamers
<Spectrum_Rush> 12 year olds
<Major> DrSteveSCARz: Exactly! Theres several things they could have done but they decided to stay with the shitty future -_-
<CrimsonPhoenix> Spademagnes[R], ask the same for fighting games
<DrSteveSCARz> what Spectrum_Rush said
<Spademagnes[R]> Hey at least fighting games are interesting
<DrSteveSCARz> Major: well COD will die soon
<Spademagnes[R]> CoD has no variations at all in its formula
<DrSteveSCARz> then Battlefield will come out on top
<Bronysith> DrSteveSCARz: not really
<StinkomanFan> I want finishers in Street Fighter... :s
<Major> DrSteveSCARz: I miss the Classic COD thats when it was good
<Bronysith> DrSteveSCARz: battlefield is becoming a yearly game as well
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well the future seems to be in right now
<VenHur> Spademagnes[R]: CoD and Halo are for babys, Mario, Zelda, Kirby, (etc) are for REAL MENS.
<StinkomanFan> Kirby
<TheKatPony> ^^
<Spademagnes[R]> I sort of find halo interesting
<DerpyMuffins> So Nintendo are for men?
<DrSteveSCARz> Bronysith: but its actually really good every year
<CrimsonPhoenix> Though Dishonored is coming out soon
<Bronysith> DrSteveSCARz: not really
<StinkomanFan> Kirby is TERRIFYING
<Spademagnes[R]> I get into it alot more than CoD ever did for me
<CrimsonPhoenix> maybe Steampunk will catch in
<Bronysith> same bland FPS game DrSteveSCARz as everything else
<CrimsonPhoenix> maybe...
<Spademagnes[R]> Kirby is a black hole with feet
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: I really hope.
<DrSteveSCARz> Bronysith: I guess the FP5 generation is dying
<Major> CrimsonPhoenix: I like Steam-Punk :3
<DrSteveSCARz> FPS*
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVE Steampunk.
<VenHur> Yeah, i'm a Nintendo fan, but I played others.
<Malk> Im drawing rainbow dash http://www.bronystate.net/paintchat/signed.html
<thelonepony> Steampunk fuck yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> I would love is Steampunk gets popular
<Bronysith> DrSteveSCARz: yup, the only one i really play anymore is Team fortress 2 cause it sacrifices realism for FUN
<JESmith71> I really hope that guy who left the posts wasn't trolling MondoPony and Equestria Forums about playing it on the radio though
<DrSteveSCARz> Bronysith: <3 TF2
<Spademagnes[R]> Time to play some Mario Kart 7

<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, what

<JESmith71> CrimsonPhoenix: A guy named souljabri557 told MondoPony that he has a uncle who has a radio station and he would try to get a Brony song (Loyalty) on the air. He said it would have played at 6:45 PM EST tonight, and it hasn't yet.

<Freefall29> doom is the best game ever made. fact
<AJIsAwesome> Freefall29: Hello!
<Vivix> I was really excited due to Rage's graphics, but when it came out- it was like all the graphics was in a glass box I could not reach (distant walls and stuff) and the game just didn't look fun- so I never bought it

<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, isn't there a N64 port of Doom?
<Freefall29> Major: the first episode is free
<Vivix> yes,
<PillowPoni> otakon: No but bad weather tends to screw with electronics and the such. Plus, you might be out the tornado's range but weather be a tricky mistress

<DrSteveSCARz> Damn wrek
<BroHoof> hey Ponies47, u got steam?
<TheKatPony> my god Wrek

<Ponies47> BroHoof: Okie doki loki :3

<kirzstryfe> I really do hate it when my inventory fills up >.>
<XylemTube> FUK YOSELF
<Rex_Mundi> You ponies ever see Linkaras review for the Doom comic book? Its epic.
<Vivix> half-life was made via Quake
<TheKatPony> lol
<Vivix> Quake was made after Doom
<cachi01|mobile> Quake is meh
<Vivix> it is
<Vivix> but it is what half life engine was based on, and maybe spawned it
<Freefall29> doom inspired half-life. even gabe newell said he wanted half-life to scare you like doom did
<Ponies47> Speaking of Steam. I changed my Avatar on Steam today :P
<TheKatPony> thats good ^^
<Vivix> Doom was great-
<Freefall29> Vivix: was?
<Vivix> It was the first FPS game I played after wolfenstein

<XylemTube> yes doom is way better than MW3
*Bronysith gives Freefall29 a cookie in his geniusness
<Bronysith> COMPARING DOOM TO MW3 Is like comparing a steak to a piece of shit
<Major> Freefall29: pft, every game is better than MW3
<DrSteveSCARz> everything is better thab mw3..except the XBOX live indie games
<Bronysith> Major: idk, have you played skyrim?
<Vivix> more like comparing two unrelated franchises with different goals
<AJIsAwesome> DrSteveSCARz: Even Journey?

<Vivix> Bronysith If he had intended that, wouldn't he have said that? Don't try to start an argument where there is none
<PillowPoni> "Fuck yourself!" Door opens
<CrimsonPhoenix> DrSteveSCARz, I mean games that have some well execute feature
<TheKatPony> I love that.
<CrimsonPhoenix> like Bastion
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dat Naration
<DrSteveSCARz> CrimsonPhoenix: Oh i ee
<CrimsonPhoenix> also dat OST
<Rex_Mundi> Soooo... when does cyborg Hitler show up?
<DrSteveSCARz> see*
<Major> Bronysith: yes listen to the wise Vivix
<Bronysith> The narrator from bastion tried narrating doom CrimsonPhoenix ...he was murdered by doom guy
<Freefall29> doom guy > master chief
<TheMaster> 3doom?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I love Dust because of how visual it is
<Bronysith> Freefall29: no shit
<TheMaster> what mod is this for?
<CrimsonPhoenix> the environment the fluid animation
<VenHur> You know, this mod makes DOOM more like Duke Nukem-y, not that i'm complaning or starting a riot.
<magmablock> Freefall29: dern tootin'
<CrimsonPhoenix> the flashy attacks
<Bronysith> Major: you do too, considering you have no idea how to spell
<cachi01|mobile> Deadlight was cool
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's easy yeah but damn me if it ain't satisfying
<Freefall29> VenHur: not even duke nukem had this much blood and gore. only the kick is from duke nukem
<Major> Bronysith: I never started this fight, you did
<Bronysith> Major: not really
<TheMaster> is this a duke nukem mod?
<magmablock> Wow, even by today's standards this game is violent as fuck
<XylemTube> This mod is awesome
<Freefall29> ep1, m9 time
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, Major just stop right now
<BroHoof> Ponies47: there found it thank god now to enter 25 numbers and/or letters to freakin steam
<TheKatPony> yep ^^
<Freefall29> he missed the secret exit
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: of course
<TheMaster> doom is best played while listening to heavy metal
<DrSteveSCARz> i miss my ps1 :(
<VenHur> I like Duke Nukem Forever more than then 3D. Yeah, I SAID IT.
<Bronysith> Freefall29: dat backseat gaming
<Vivix> Bronysith you egg on everyone to make yourself into some kinda "ultra true gamer", actually actively going after those who don't agree to start a bitchfight, how are you not starting the fight?
<Bronysith> DrSteveSCARz: ps1 had really good gaming
<Major> CrimsonPhoenix: Ive tried to stop this but he just keeps bouncing back
<Ponies47> BroHoof: Good ^^
<DrSteveSCARz> Bronysith: Yeahh it did
<Vivix> I like most of the games you like, but I really disagree with this "false gamer" bullshit you've been spouting the past two days
<Rex_Mundi> oh, you get allies in this game?
<Bronysith> DrSteveSCARz: final fantasy 6 and 7,
<Bronysith> DrSteveSCARz: and so far i like 8
<DrSteveSCARz> Bronysith: my dad and i always played FF, then 10 cam out and we lost faith
<otakon> Bronysith: have you tried 12 yet?
<Bronysith> otakon: i dont want to
<otakon> I honestly like 12
<otakon> Bronysith: try it
<TheMaster> they don't make fps' like they use to anymore
<Bronysith> otakon: i am currently playing 8 to base my opinoins on my own
<TheMaster> its all regenerating health and cover based shooting
*RaveBrony has never played a FF game :'(
<Famicom> WUT??
<TheKatPony> ^^
<Bronysith> otakon: all i heard is "IT sucks" or "its awesome" never in between
<Vivix> FPS has --changed
<XylemTube> I think the minigun is my favorite weapon here so far
<otakon> RaveBrony: GO DOWNLOAD FF6 NOW
<Famicom> what ota said
<otakon> RaveBrony: NOW DAMMIT NOW
<RaveBrony> ._.
<twilight_sprinkle> tbh the term "gamer" sounds funny to me.. the point of games is to have fun, not to play games for the sake of it
<Bronysith> RaveBrony: GET ON WITH IT
<Rex_Mundi> Isnt it Ironic that something called "Final phantasy" has more than 1 installment?
<Freefall29> RaveBrony: PLAY IT!!!!
<RaveBrony> o_o
*AJIsAwesome has never played any FF game or Chrono Trigger
<Bronysith> RaveBrony: it is the best final fantasy next to 7
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: ...
<RaveBrony> I shall!!
<TheMaster> well originally final fantasy was meant to be the last game the developer made
<TheKatPony> I haven't played it either
<TheMaster> but it sold so well they just kept it up
<DrSteveSCARz> twilight_sprinkle: Some ppl take it as a way of life and make money off it though
*RaveBrony runs off to find some downloads
<Freefall29> AJIsAwesome: ...
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, do you call yourself a Brony?
<Famicom> do it nao for great justice
*Major doesnt really see the problem with not playing FF :/
<BroHoof> Ponies47: and yet another fck my life moment duplicated code -_-
<Vivix> I don't call myself a gamer, despite my gaming history
<Freefall29> Major: what is this... I don't even...
<Bronysith> Major: play final fantasy 6 or 7, and you will see
<TheMaster> I love this doom track.
<Major> Freefall29: its life, get used to it
<TheMaster> almost as good as m1h1
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: bronies are a community, gamers arent, theres too much controversy among them
<Freefall29> Major: It's
<otakon> ^
<Ponies47> BroHoof: Well that sucks :|
<TheKatPony> twilgiht_sprinkle THANK YOU.
<otakon> FF6 is probably one of the best JRPG's out there
<XylemTube> cool song here
<DrSteveSCARz> twilight_sprinkle: There controversy among bronies?! WHTA
<Rex_Mundi> You know whats cool to do in chat rooms? Resident Evil quotes. I hope this isnt chrisses blood.
<BroHoof> Ponies47: yea just hope the cd works for now
<otakon> DrSteveSCARz: no he's satying there is controversy among gamers
<Vivix> I don't mind people saying "I like calling myself a gamer" but I don't like it when they start telling others "I am a real gamer, you are not"
<DrSteveSCARz> otakon: Oh thank god :)
<Ponies47> BroHoof: It better
<magmablock> Blammo, the Shoot Gun!
<twilight_sprinkle> DrSteveSCARz: i meant controversy among gamers, but theres some controversy among bronies as well, but not enough to not call it a community
<Freefall29> Vivix: but some people are not real gamers
<BroHoof> Ponies47: yea
<otakon> holy shit this looks insane
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: cloppers?
<Vivix> Freefall29, not true, some poeple just like different games
<CrimsonPhoenix> tbh the term "Brony" sounds funny to me.. the point of MLP is to enjoy a well made show, not to watch ponies for the sake of it
<otakon> goddammit now I have the urge to play Doom again
<TheKatPony> Vivix: Yeah that's what I don't like.
<TheMaster> What mod is this anyway? Duke Nukem 3d?
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: cloppers, furries, shipping, best pony, and plenty other stuff
<DrSteveSCARz> Bronysith: I dont thnk cloppers are a controversy, just a problem that needs to be corrected
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: okay
<Freefall29> TheMaster: doom
<VenHur> TheMaster: Nope, it's Brutal DOOM
<Vivix> I can call myself a brony because- it specificly means I enjoy the show, it's not "I am an animation nerd general that may include any or all of the above"
<Bronysith> DrSteveSCARz: i dont see any problem with cloppers to be honest.
<Freefall29> brutal doom, takes doom and triples the blood and gore
<Bronysith> DrSteveSCARz: it is not child porn or necrophilia
<TheMaster> Brutal Doom? I must aquire this then
<Bronysith> Freefall29: megusta?
<TheMaster> always been a fan of doom related things. Doom 3 is one of my favorite fps' actually
<Vivix> Cloppers aren't a problem unless they force anything
<DrSteveSCARz> Bronysith: True, but i just dont understand it that much
<Vivix> and we don't
<Freefall29> TheMaster: you can get it off steam for like... 10 bucks
<Major> Freefall29: no really? I didnt notice
<CrimsonPhoenix> Brony is as much of a label as Gamer is
<JappleAck> RULE 34 is why we can't have nice things
<Vivix> It is
<TheKatPony> ^^
<Freefall29> Major: Themaster mixed up this game for duke nukem 3d... I corrected him
<Bronysith> JappleAck: but r34 gives us nice things
<DeadpoolDash> Rule 34 is made for nice things
<PillowPoni> This pack of carrots is almost gone.
<RaveBrony> o_o
<Major> Freefall29: ah sorry
<JappleAck> Bronysith: LOL
<CrimsonPhoenix> R34 is a simple fantasy
<DrSteveSCARz> rule 34 ruined many things
<Vivix> R34 is optional for those who want it
<cachi01|mobile> R34 is a nice thing....
<Rex_Mundi> I like to think of "Brony" as being a combination of "Brother" and "pony", rather than "bro", specificly because when i hear "Bro" I think of those insipid type of people you see in college. The ones that just drink and party, y'know, "bros". Dont my fellow "brother ponies" here agree?
<Bronysith> cachi01|mobile: /)
<cachi01|mobile> (\
<Bronysith> ARE VIDEO GAMES ART?
<AJIsAwesome> http://derpy.me/0564C
<Bronysith> age old question
<otakon> yes they can be Bronysith
<DrSteveSCARz> Bronysith: Some of them
<Vivix> All creative excesses are art
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: id say they can be
<cachi01|mobile> Yes they are
<cachi01|mobile> Some
<TheKatPony> they can be
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, I would say yes to that
<cachi01|mobile> Like limbo
<Major> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> ^^
<otakon> or Journey
<Major> Limbo was epic
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi, I can agree to that
<cachi01|mobile> And the unfinished swan
<twilight_sprinkle> just what i was thinking
<Bronysith> Major: *is
<otakon> or Shadow of the Colossue
<Freefall29> this guy really knows doom well.
<Bronysith> otakon: that game is awesome
<CrimsonPhoenix> since VideoGames are things that needs to be created
<Vivix> I really really liked Dear Esther, and that is all art and no gameplay
<otakon> Freefall29: it's Wrek
<JappleAck> who is streaming
<CrimsonPhoenix> from an imaginative mind
<cachi01|mobile> ALL THE BLOOD!!
<CrimsonPhoenix> but
<TheKatPony> Wrek is streaming
<JappleAck> oh
<twilight_sprinkle> if you can create worlds in games, hows it different from painting or architecture, those are considered arts
<Vivix> Yeah, all creative outlets are in some form art
<otakon> I LOVE the reload animation
<CrimsonPhoenix> rather a game is good art or not is arguable
<cachi01|mobile> holy shit this game is bloody
<Freefall29> I tip my hat to Wrek. Bravo Wrek! <3
<Major> Bronysith: I like Limbo but I got bored of it after a while
<Rex_Mundi> R34 is awesome for those that like it, and shouldnt be forced on people who dont.
<CrimsonPhoenix> what twilight_sprinkle said
<PillowPoni> cachi01|mobile: HUZZAH! THE BLOOD HAS BEEN TRIPLED!
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi, I also agree to that! High five
<otakon> Rex_Mundi: well said too
<TheKatPony> lol
<Major> Rex_Mundi: amen lad
<cachi01|mobile> What doom is this?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, same goes for MLP
<Freefall29> cachi01|mobile: doom 1
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|mobile: First.
<PillowPoni> Rex_Mundi: Thank you.
<cachi01|mobile> Brb downloading lol
<Freefall29> only reason this looks fancy is because its a source port
<Vivix> CrimsonPhoenix, yeah, forcing it makes people dislike it-
<CrimsonPhoenix> ^^^^
<CrimsonPhoenix> So much this
<CrimsonPhoenix> and we actually have someone that can vouch on that
<CrimsonPhoenix> right Ponies47?
<Vivix> Hehehe
<TheKatPony> I have noticed that. If you force ponys on to people, it usually causes them to hate it even more.
<Rex_Mundi> Even though most of the stuff on EQAD is not well drawn.
<Bronysith> gatling guns <3
<Bronysith> or minguns
<Bronysith> whatever
<kirzstryfe> can't send mail to self, what kind of bs is that >.<
<cachi01|mobile> EQAD has some good stuff
<CrimsonPhoenix> EQAD?
<Vivix> adult version of EQD
<Vivix> run by other people
<cachi01|mobile> After dark
<Vivix> actually run by a nonclopper- for some reason
<TheMaster> theres a adult version? is it just a r34 site?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> they are going to sell you a minion who take it to the store :p
<CrimsonPhoenix> Not following your favorite r34 artist?
<Rex_Mundi> I heard that 1 of the guys is on both EQD and EQAD
<Major> Welp, Im gonna hit the sack, night all
<Vivix> yeah, pretty much, fanfic and pictures
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: Hehehehe :$
<Freefall29> man those pinkies (pie) sure are cool
<Vivix> Night major!
<PillowPoni> Night Major. Sleep well.
<AJIsAwesome> Major: Night!
<TheKatPony> night Major
<cachi01|mobile> Vivix and games
<cachi01|mobile> And animations
<Vivix> Oh yeah
<DrSteveSCARz> Night Major
<Ponies47> Night Major! Sleep well!
<Vivix> Anything of interest to cloppers
<Azura_2ndClassNoob> just came. Is this game DOOM?
<TheMaster> modded doom
<cachi01|mobile> Yep
<Zephyr> what mods?
<cachi01|mobile> Modded?
<TheKatPony> yeah pretty much
<cachi01|mobile> What mods?
<Vivix> BrutalDoom or something
<DrSteveSCARz> SOO MUCH RED
<Freefall29> Azura_2ndClassNoob: its not called doom. it's called the greatest game ever made.
<Zephyr> i think i see custom death animations...
<Zephyr> i want
<PillowPoni> My god....
<TheKatPony> Mod is like an extra gamemode for something
<Bronysith> Vivix: well gentlemen clubs are usually run by women...
<cachi01|mobile> BLOOD FOR.THE BLOOD GOD
<Vivix> Bronysith, truue
<twilight_sprinkle> theres an r34 EQD? lol
<Vivix> I think Alex..said he only wanted to archive it, and had no interest in it himself
<twilight_sprinkle> so much dedication
<DrSteveSCARz> nNICE
<AJIsAwesome> Anyone remember the #1 game from yesterday was?
<Vivix> Alexstrasza is the EQaD guy , right?
<cachi01|mobile> My dad is at home BRB
<Rex_Mundi> Vivix: He actually is a clopper, just not a hardcore one, he likes plot. I checked that site out once, most of the stuff made me sick.
<Vivix> Aah
<Freefall29> Rex_Mundi: cloppers have plot?
<Ponies47> Chat derped.
<Vivix> I thought the FAQ said he only had archive interest
<Zephyr> AJ: it was Portal
<TheKatPony> Yeah, im not a fan of pony porn.
<DrSteveSCARz> TheKatPony: Thank you
<Prince_Blueblood> if clopper stuff makes you sick, you have no idea of what else lurks on the internet.
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, Portal
<TheMaster> the internet is a very scary place
<TheMaster> not for the faint of heart
<Vivix> I totally support anything that isn't harmful
<Freefall29> I once saw a doom mod where instead of space marine. we got apple jack.
<TheKatPony> Very scary.
<Prince_Blueblood> pony pr0n = softcore
<Vivix> well. Not actively support
<Zephyr> wait, there's pony mods for this game?
<AJIsAwesome> TheKatPony: Me neither. I
<Zephyr> actually nvm, not surprised
<Vivix> pony porn is pretty softcore, most of it
<DrSteveSCARz> idc what kind it is
<Freefall29> Zephyr: yeah. but because the game is old. interest in making a pony mod is little compared to modern games like tf2
<TheMaster> if theres ever an outbreak of monsters i know which weapon to acquire
<TheMaster> and thats a shotgun
<twilight_sprinkle> i saw one hardcore pony r34 <.< cannot unsee
<CrimsonPhoenix> I saw a doom mod where you are gumshoe and you kill various stuff like some touhou moe shit captain falcon a racing car
<Bronysith> i dont like porn <_< >_>
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe we're getting a little off course, guys.....
<Spectrum_Rush> we should change the subject.. ya know rules and all
<Vivix> yeah
<TheKatPony> you dont say?
<Rex_Mundi> Most of the stuff there not that well drawn. Hardcore is gross
<DrSteveSCARz> AJIsAwesome: What course should we be on
*Prince_Blueblood rolls eyes
*Freefall29 changes channel
<Rex_Mundi> yeah, change the subject
<AJIsAwesome> DrSteveSCARz: Favrotie food?
<Ponies47> Bronysith: Then explain all the NSFW that you posted in Dashiesauce? -_-
<CrimsonPhoenix> and you had weapons like Phoenix's finger, gundam hand and other ridiculous stuff like that
<DrSteveSCARz> LOBSTAH
<TheMaster> more discussions on doom
<TheKatPony> mmmm lobster...
<BroHoof> Ponies47: well im stuck here can u add me?
<twilight_sprinkle> Ponies47: liarjack face
<WalkerPony89> Hiyo guys
*Prince_Blueblood high5's Ponies47
<Bronysith> Ponies47: i have a liarjack face, holy shit you are so fucking slowpoke.jpg
<TheKatPony> hello WalkerPony89
<Ponies47> BroHoof: PM me your name
<Vivix> Well, guys. I'm off. Bye!
<TheMaster> Like how doom is the best video game ever made
<AJIsAwesome> WalkerPony89: Hello!
<Spectrum_Rush> Ponies47: arent you a bit young to be in dashiesauce :|
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Vivix
<TheKatPony> later Vivix!
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Bye!
*Vivix waves and hugs all
<Ponies47> Spectrum_Rush: They don't give a buck
<WalkerPony89> Cya Vivix
<Darkts3|Trader|MLG2> hey everyone, im guessing Wrek is streaming?
<Reikim> Social obligations fulfilled for the day.
<AJIsAwesome> How about that local sports team?
<kirzstryfe> lol
<AJIsAwesome> Darkts3|Trader|MLG2: Yes.
<twilight_sprinkle> screw local sports team, Roger Federer woooooo!
<Bronysith> Wrek: how long have you played DOOM for?
<Reikim> I am fully prepared for tomorrow's events.
<Ponies47> Bronysith: Twas a joke. And besides my comptuer is junk so it lags alot
<Wrek> sicne the age of 3
<WalkerPony89> AJIsAwesome: What about them? My local football team is gonna REALLY suck this year
<Darkts3|Trader|MLG2> Wrek: =/
<Freefall29> Wrek: you're a god
<AJIsAwesome> WalkerPony89: Just making small talk.
<WalkerPony89> Wrek: I find that hard to believe
<DrSteveSCARz> WalkerPony89: What team is that
<TheMaster> its going to be hard for the w-man to play doom if you keep pinging him
<TheKatPony> I believe you, Wrek lol
<WalkerPony89> DrSteveSCARz: Fulda Raiders. Most of the good football players graduated last year
<Spectrum_Rush> WalkerPony89: youve obviously had a sheltered life then
<Darkts3|Trader|MLG2> ok lets stop pinging him
<TheKatPony> lol yeah
<WalkerPony89> Spectrum_Rush: Why do you say that?
<DrSteveSCARz> Zombie Apocolypse: Aquire Shotgun
<kirzstryfe> I have to start a new job tomorrow, business attire, and I'm hoping it all goes well
<DrSteveSCARz> Alien Invasion: Aquire Shotgun
<Reikim> Sounds like a real job for real.
<kirzstryfe> yeah, 40h/week
<Wrek> WalkerPony89: i could put my dad on to tell you its the truth
<Wrek> sadly its 2am and he's asleep
<otakon> that would be a bad idea
<Bronysith> must buy ultimate doom
<Bronysith> achieve life
<otakon> waking up your dad at 2 am
<TheKatPony> that would be funny lol
<Spectrum_Rush> WalkerPony89: well aside from the finesse wrek show s while playing doom, its all about the parents as Wrek just stated
<Zephyr> is he playing with jump?
<kirzstryfe> but, for one month I'll basically make what I made in the last 2 1/2-3 months
<Bronysith> Zephyr: what is this...jump you speak of?
<DrSteveSCARz> otakon: if i did that i wouldnt be here right now
<Freefall29> i'm supposed to be doing homework....
<TheKatPony> jump?
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<WalkerPony89> Spectrum_Rush: I'm just now seeing Wrek play Doom, so you gotta forgive me for that
<Zephyr> haha guess not then
<TheKatPony> I should be doing homework too...
<WalkerPony89> Which Doom is this anyway?
<Zephyr> first
<Spectrum_Rush> 1
<Freefall29> some source ports allow you to jump. but its better not to jump
<TheKatPony> the first one
<Freefall29> ultimate doom.
<Reikim> Cools tuff.
<Wrek> as soem of the guys here know
<Zephyr> yeah i was wondering cause this port (ZDoom) allows jump, but it really cheapens some of the puzzles
<Reikim> *cool stuff
<Wrek> i beat all of the DOOM on ultraviolence without strafing
<WalkerPony89> A modded version or...? Because I've played the 1st Doom, and this looks WAY different
<Wrek> so yes ive played this alot
<Wrek> :|
<Freefall29> Wrek: what about nightmare mode?
<WalkerPony89> Wrek: Alone?! :O
<TheKatPony> damn Wrek
*Bronysith bows before Wrek
<Darkts3|Trader|MLG2> oh god
<Wrek> nightmare is physically impossible beyond doom 1
<Zephyr> play Plutonia's secret levels
<Zephyr> if you want a challenge
<JRP> Boo
<rockytoppie85> is anyone streaming?
<kirzstryfe> going to be like going back to school, next 11 weeks are all training >.<
<TheKatPony> Wrek is ^^
<WalkerPony89> rockytoppie85: Yup. Wrek is streaming Doom
*Freefall29 does the I am now worthy bow before wrek
<Freefall29> not
<Reikim> What kind of job is it?
<Darkts3|Trader|MLG2> ?
<Zephyr> he's playing some obscure game from the 90s with crappy graphics
<rockytoppie85> okay i guess i have to refresh
<WalkerPony89> Why am I hearing pings and yet am not being pinged?
<kirzstryfe> tech support in a call center
<LoGaN> hi
<Freefall29> me shoots Zephyr
<WalkerPony89> Zephyr: Doom is far from obscure, my friend
<TheKatPony> Its on the stream
*Freefall29 shoots Zephyr
<DrSteveSCARz> Zephyr: Uhh there were no bad graphics back then
<LoGaN> hi
<Zephyr> (that's the joke) =/
<TheKatPony> So you're not being pinged, Wrek is.
*Bronysith puts a hand tenderly around Zephyr s trachea
<Ponies47> Hey LoGaN
<Reikim> Tech support?
<Freefall29> Zephyr: graphics are for noobs
*Bronysith shakes Zephyr wildly
<LoGaN> CAN BRONYSTATE COUNT TO 10?
<TheKatPony> hello LoGaN
<thelonepony> hai LoGaN
<Bronysith> Zephyr: YOU DONT PLAY A GAME FOR GRAPHICS
<Bronysith> Zephyr: thats what movies are for
<WalkerPony89> TheKatPony: Ah, thanks
<Bronysith> and MGS4
<LoGaN> i do
<kirzstryfe> try to walk people through how to work their phones or fix problems
<DrSteveSCARz> you play it for enjoyment
<TheKatPony> I play games for gameplay.
*DeadpoolDash plays for bewbs
<Reikim> Oh
<Zephyr> but seriously, love this game. Still go back to it regularly.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, that I guess may depend
<TheKatPony> Not so much as graphics
<Freefall29> I can admit the graphics are outdated but they arn't crappy, they were fantastic for 1993
<AJIsAwesome> 1, 2, 3.................10.
<Reikim> That sounds like it could be alternatingly really fun or really frustrating.
<Basenji> ooo Doom haven't played this in years...
<Darkts3|Trader|MLG2> xD
<kirzstryfe> both most likely
<TheKatPony> 1, 2, 4, 7, 10.
<TheKatPony> Yay i did it.
<sub06905|Gamecube> E, 4, !, 10
<Bronysith> The narrator from bastion attempted to narrate in doom...he was then gutted by the doom guy
<Freefall29> doom guy made satan his bitch
<kirzstryfe> I already have some experience with how hard headed people can be over the phone, and how to talk them down from being pissed off
<sub06905|Gamecube> lol
<Bronysith> Freefall29: after all, doom guy is best dominatrix
<TheKatPony> i love the doom guy
<XylemTube> Dem secrets
*DrSteveSCARz hums to game music
<Bronysith> i am now picturing doom guy in a maid outfit...
<TheKatPony> ^^
<Bronysith> and he is now standing right behind me
<Bronysith> aaaand hes got a gun
<DeadpoolDash> What would happen if Doom guy and Marathon guy got into a fight?
*Bronysith is violently murdered by the doom guy
<Freefall29> DeadpoolDash: doom guy wins
<PillowPoni> Bronysith: Run.
<TheKatPony> oooohhh shit
<PillowPoni> Too late
*Bronysith regenerates
*Bronysith has tea with the doom guy
<Freefall29> quake 1 guy vs doom guy
*Bronysith is murdered again by the doom guy
<Bronysith> that was painful
<Zephyr> Its amusing to just picture what the doomguy looks like running past at 400km/h. Sideways. While shooting an RPG.
<TheKatPony> Bronysith: ya alright?
<PillowPoni> My face when I forgot I had eggs boiling on the stove
*Freefall29 pokes Bronysith with a stick
<Bronysith> TheKatPony: yea, after he murdered me we had a nice cup of tea

<Bronysith> doom guy is best murderer
<Ponies47> Bye Dr....
<Freefall29> I personally don't count plutonia or evilution as canon as they were not made by id software
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
<Ponies47> I am so slow =_(\
<TheKatPony> CrimsonPhoenix: That is amazing :D
<cades> hey
<Freefall29> CrimsonPhoenix: get tara strong to voice it
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: That's epic.
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: O_O
<LoGaN> hi Wrek
<sagas> and im back
<AJIsAwesome> sagas: Welcome back!
<VenHur> CrimsonPhoenix: My jaws are dropped beyond words...
<sub06905|Gamecube> If your little girl is a big fan of the My Little Pony character, then she will love this twilight sparkle pillow....... Yea its for my "daughter" >_>
<TheKatPony> Isn't Nightmare Moon voiced by Tabitha St Germain?
<LadyCanary> I hear moo-ing
<Freefall29> someone should make a doom mod where the monsters are our congress members
<CrimsonPhoenix> TheKatPony, indeed
<WalkerPony89> TheKatPony: That she is
<TheKatPony> That's what I thought.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but Freefall29 is refering to how Tara voice Bubbles
<CCCP> Hallo..
<Freefall29> CrimsonPhoenix: yeah. yeah I was
<sub06905|Gamecube> ello CCCP
<TheKatPony> She does?
<CCCP> hai sub06905|Gamecube
<Rex_Mundi> Hasbro should make a MLP movie, it will turn every movie theater into a miny brony convention the day it comes out!:)
<CrimsonPhoenix> TheKatPony, yes
<TheKatPony> Oh my God I feel like such an idiot.
<Buytoast> that's a terrible idea
<sagas> this music is annoying
<Freefall29> Rex_Mundi: funny. I said something like that a few months ago
<Cypresswolf> Freefall29: to qoute the old lady in Mars Attacks "They blew up Congress :D"
<CCCP> Hai sagas!
<VenHur> No, it's awesome, jeesh.
<sagas> Rex_Mundi: bad idea
<CrimsonPhoenix> TheKatPony, and she voice Raven in Teen titans as well as Batgirl in Batman and Harley in Arkham City
<sub06905|Gamecube> I actually had a dream where i was watching a MLP FIM movie in theaters :D
<Freefall29> sagas: this music is awesome bro
<CrimsonPhoenix> She also voice Timmy
<sagas> hiya CCCP
<Rex_Mundi> How is it a bad idea?
<CrimsonPhoenix> aaaaaaand quite a lot more
<TheKatPony> I did not know that XD
<WalkerPony89> Am I the only one who's never dreamed of ponies before?
<VenHur> sub0905|Gamecube: I would LOVE to hear all about it.
<Iwa> The respawn timers in this game are so generous :D
<Kimori> hi]
<Kimori> hi
<CrimsonPhoenix> TheKatPony, do your research you might find more about it
<Freefall29> WalkerPony89: I haven't had a pony dream yet either. :'(
<WalkerPony89> Rex_Mundi: I just can't see a full movie working. Not now, at least
<Cypresswolf> As bad as Mars Attacks was - the scene where the zap the entire US Congress was the best scene in that movie :)
<VenHur> WalkerPony89: Same here.
<Rex_Mundi> I can, what with season 3 being short and everything
<LadyCanary> ..Oh man, the music of DEATH would go perfectly with this gameplay.
<CrimsonPhoenix> like how the dad of Sweetie Belle's VA is the director of Being Ian and the voice of Glitch Bob in Reboot
<Freefall29> WalkerPony89: with half the shit hollywood makes every year. yeah, they can make a my little pony movie
<TheKatPony> WalkerPony89: I haven't
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905|Gamecube: How was the dream movie?
<Freefall29> hey. don't disable the music
<CCCP> http://i.imgur.com/ToU79.png
<WalkerPony89> Freefall29: Well, a full movie would take a LONG time to make, especially a quality movie
<Bronysith> miley cyrus covered smells like teen spirit...
<shibaru> The glitchiness is gone
<TheKatPony> Mmhmm
<Rex_Mundi> If Hasbro can make a a Battleshio movies, than certainly MLP, with all the little kids and the brony fandom behind it, can get a movie too.
<Reikim> Hm, leaving for now
<VenHur> CCCP: Michael Bay in a nutshell
<Kandarihu> I swear, when the English version of PSO2 comes out, half the people are just gonna play as Ranger and get to cap as Ranger without touching Hunter or Force.
<sub06905|Gamecube> VenHur: well all i can remember is that i was sitting in the theater with alot of other bronies, then the movie started, it had some new songs and other things, then for some reason two people started fighting and then everyone started fighting. the end
<sagas> disable the music
<CrimsonPhoenix> well there was a PPG movie
<TheKatPony> no dont!
<Freefall29> sagas: stfu
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905|Gamecube: What a story, Mark.
<sagas> Freefall29: no.
<sub06905|Gamecube> AJIsAwesome: :D
<TheKatPony> I loved the PGG movie
<TheKatPony> *PPG
<CCCP> there should be a video game that has alot of cats in it
<sagas> the music is horriby cheesey
<Freefall29> CCCP: well... there is the disney movie the aristocats
<Freefall29> CCCP: nvm
<PillowPoni> Punch a walking pelvis. Nice
<sagas> the 90s were a bad time for video game music
<TheKatPony> Freefall29: A video game.
<Kandarihu> Freefall29, he said videogame.
<CCCP> Freefall29 But I WANT A GAME! :[
<sub06905|Gamecube> i also had a dream where i was watching a 7 min preview of a episode from Season 3
<sagas> early 90s
<WalkerPony89> CCCP: Funny, since the game publishing part of Warner Bros actually take a lot of risks
<Freefall29> my bad. derp herp. :P
<WalkerPony89> Lollipop Chainsaw anyone?
<VenHur> I loved that movie!
<TheKatPony> lol
<sagas> sub06905|Gamecube: WHAT WAS IN IT? IT COULD BE A PREMONITION
<Rex_Mundi> One guy interviewed on everfree radio say that if MLP ever comes to Japan, its more likely to be an Japanese made anime version rather than the original ala PPG. A MLPZ if you will.
<CCCP> WalkerPony89 they make Risk?
<Kandarihu> CCCP, there's a room in Tales of Symphonia with lots of cats in it.
<WalkerPony89> CCCP: Maybe. I have no idea myself :p
<Freefall29> Rex_Mundi: with everything else that japan allows in their animes?
<CrimsonPhoenix> CCCP are you talking about Dust?
<CCCP> Kandarihu but it needs to be the whole game!
<sub06905|Gamecube> from that dream i remember that trixie was in it and they were in a snowy area
<VenHur> No, no, NO. I don't like an "MLPZ"...Too risky.
<CCCP> CrimsonPhoenix wats that?
<sagas> I miss the playing the board game risk
<sagas> anyone know where I can play a version of it in my browser?
<Freefall29> sagas: there is a flash version, but there is no music
<Kandarihu> CCCP, yeah. In that game, the female lead will name every dog in every town by talking to them while active.
<sagas> the screen constantly blinking red is annoying
<WalkerPony89> Have any PC gamers out there played Dark Souls?
<sagas> Freefall29: I dont mind a board game without music
<StinkomanFan> Why do you have to reload in this version?
<sagas> WalkerPony89: I have for the 360
<StinkomanFan> Seriously?
<Freefall29> are we even talking about doom anymore
<sagas> WalkerPony89: Has it come out for the PC?
<Freefall29> or this board game called rsk
<Freefall29> risk
<WalkerPony89> sagas: That's good. I have it for the 360 as well. And yeah, it came out a week ago or so
<sagas> Freefall29: I wasnt talking about doom anymore
<Rex_Mundi> VenHur: Perhaps, but what harm could it do, really. PPGZ diddnt ruin anything.
<sagas> WalkerPony89: I dont think those controls would translate well to PC
<Vordox> DOOOM
<TheKatPony> yes.
<WalkerPony89> sagas: Where there's a will, there's a way
<Freefall29> imagine doom z
<sagas> So anybody know where I can find a browser version of the game Risk?
<WalkerPony89> http://images.4chan.org/v/src/1346025819888.jpg Win.
<WalkerPony89> Sure hope that pic works...
<Freefall29> WalkerPony89: failed
<WalkerPony89> Damn
<TheKatPony> lol
<Kimori> whats up?
<Rex_Mundi> But yeah, imagine if the MLP movie gets made and there is a midnight showing. The news will deffinatly report on than. I say moreso than any of our conventions.
<Freefall29> Rex_Mundi: like the news already hasent
<TheKatPony> That would be amazing
<XAX> lol midnight showing
<XAX> that would be sick
<TheKatPony> I'd go to it :D
<SirGanjalf> http://www.halolz.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/halolz-dot-com-pokemon-timburton1.jpg - fund it?
<TheKatPony> I gotta go. See you guys later :)
<PillowPoni> Bye TheKatPony
<WalkerPony89> Later TheKatPony
<SirGanjalf> night TheKatPony
<CCCP> mfw, most Consol gamers are 12 year olds that hate everyone, handheld gamers are 5, and PC gamers just talk about how much better they are than consol gamers and dont shut up
<Rex_Mundi> Imagine, because of bronies, the MLP movies out grosses some blockbuster movie in the charts.
<AJIsAwesome> TheKatPony: Bye!
<CCCP> bye TheKatPony
<WalkerPony89> Not that Hasbro would have a midnight showing
<Freefall29> on channel 5 news tonight. there was a shooting at a midnight premier of mlp the movie. it started over an argument of best pony then went down hill from there. more at 11
<JESmith71> Freefall29: NO
<WalkerPony89> Freefall29: That was kinda... uncalled for
<Freefall29> yeah. sorry
<SirGanjalf> Freefall29: I laughed. Am i bad person?
<DerpDash> Hey everypony!:) Whos streaming?
<Rex_Mundi> Wrek
<AJIsAwesome> DerpDash: Hello! Wrek is.
<Freefall29> I'll admit that was in bad taste
<CCCP> hi DerpDash
<SirGanjalf> Freefall29: Yeah, maybe a bit too soon...
<AJIsAwesome> Freefall29: It's okay You meant it as a joke. It's all in good fun.

<CCCP> Freefall29 well... /b/day was the day that Anonymous revolted against 4chan and truly became their own soveriegn nation on the internet.
<WalkerPony89> Funny pun is funny
<DerpDash> BroHoof: prof pic?
<Freefall29> why did they revolt?
<CCCP> Freefall29 just look it up :P
<BroHoof> DerpDash: a pic of vinyl scratch
<WalkerPony89> CCCP: Now that just sounds badass
<Rex_Mundi> Freefall29: They gave the furries their own board, then took it away soon after and banned everyone that posted in it. Considereing all the yiff pr0n on /b/, it was kinda hypocritical on 4chans part.
<CCCP> WalkerPony89 its glorified...
<Buytoast> all /b/ is these days is porn thread porn thread copypasta gore thread americlaps/yuropoors porn thread
<Freefall29> doesn't most of anon hate furries with a passion?
<DerpDash> BroHoof: What was the name i typed meanofdeath but nothing came up.
<Buytoast> oh, and the furry and pony threads
<WalkerPony89> sagas: http://boards.4chan.org/v/res/152656859#p152656859 Curse really can suck
<LadyCanary> o_o
<Rex_Mundi> not really, alot of them are Furries, the only opeople who troll furries nowadays are furries themselvs
<BroHoof> DerpDash: it's that acctualy : meanofdeath
<CCCP> WalkerPony89 dat link... is probably not the smartest thing to post that here .... :s
<WalkerPony89> Buytoast: If you got a warped sense of humer (like me), it can be funny as all hell though
<WalkerPony89> CCCP: A Dark Souls thread on 4chan? I see nothing wrong with that
<Buytoast> well yeah it can be funny, but not when it's all shitty porn and stuff
<Buytoast> with all the summer there's nothing good
<Freefall29> I can tolerate furries. for the most part
<DerpDash> BroHoof: try typing my name to see if anything comes up: PixekHunter or MegaFlyer
<Freefall29> when they start dressing in fursuits, I cross the line there
<CCCP> WalkerPony89 well it has links to NSFW things and anyone could post somthing pretty NSFW any second, honestly
<DerpDash> BroHoof: and my prof pic is of homestuck
<Buytoast> hell, /v/ is better then /b/ these days
<sagas> WalkerPony89: Yeah and you gotta use a curse to go through New Londo
<BroHoof> DerpDash: one problem i cant add x_x the feature is locked for me :/
<WalkerPony89> sagas: Just gotta get some Transient Curses and you're fine
<LoGaN> has anybody noticed on raibow dashes mane they skip indigo? this pussles me very very much!
<DerpDash> BroHoof: oh :(
<Rex_Mundi> Freefall29: Why, Fursuits are just Cosplay, its the fursuit fetishists that are to be hated, they are less than 1% of the fandom though.
<CCCP> LoGaN pussles? lol
<DerpDash> well i cant see u on search results
*Dovah is disliking DaS speak cuz it reminds him he doesnt have prepare to die yet....
<LoGaN> puzzles
<DerpDash> BroHoof: any other name?
<WalkerPony89> CCCP: Anyone could post anything NSFW on any thread. And if someone wanders off to a part of the site with NSFW stuff on it, it's their fault, not mine
<sagas> WalkerPony89: I know you pick up one on the way there, but I died and im out of them and they all wore off so im fucked
<LoGaN> nsfw
<CCCP> WalkerPony89 well i know... just you might want to be more careful..
<BroHoof> DerpDash: names of accs that i dont use so ya.. x_x

<Reikim> I am about to finish the largest binge I have ever done on a series.
<Reikim> Ever.
<kirzstryfe> which series?
<Reikim> Homestuck.
<NocturnalBlade> sooo much BLOOD!
<kirzstryfe> -.-
<Rex_Mundi> This looks rather difficult
<tigher1001> Pikachu: in minecraft?
<PillowPoni> NocturnalBlade: It's Doom.
<cades> scares*
<Dken2021> Pikachu neato
<Pikachu> tigher: eeyyup
<Reikim> One of the few comics where you can fall behind for a year and have over a thousand pages to catch up on afterwards.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,011,000 dull pages?
*NocturnalBlade i know but still
<Reikim> I'm about to clear it in a time span of...say, three days?
<DerpDash> walks into random cave...meets fat behemoths:You came to the wrong neighborhood motherf***er
<SaxyPretender> 0,14sinfest is better
<kirzstryfe> ^
<NocturnalBlade> whoops
<Reikim> Nah, they stopped being dull ages ago.
<tigher1001> Pikachu: there is a mod called animal bikes and one of them is a pony bike
<Pikachu> ik
<Kimori> lol ok...
<Reikim> I've been putting this off for a year, now seemed a good time to deal with it.
<kirzstryfe> Homestuck fans make up the biggest group of annoying fucks I've ever seen at cons
<Pikachu> i have it and im a luna rideing a luna right now (like a bawss)
<tigher1001> Pikachu: ridin celestia like a boss
<Dovah> sagas: I would come on and help you but I have too many things on my router since my mom when and wasted $400 on an Iphone and Ipad and fuck up my internet so i cant :|

<Rex_Mundi> darn this looks hard
<tigher1001> Pikachu: yo dawg
<Freefall29> he threw a lost skull....
<sagas> How do you fuck up a router with an ipone and ipad?
<Reikim> Full of idiots and fools.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm trying to start Homestuck.
<Reikim> Obsessed with shipping
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've read 20 or 30 pages in.
<Dovah> sagas: way to many things connected to it
<Reikim> See, Nitt, that's the damn problem with Homestuck.
<Rex_Mundi> Do the enemies still fight each other if they hit each other?
<Reikim> It takes literally like a thousand pages to get interesting.
<Ponies47|Shower> BRB shower
<Kimori> Its the wierdest thing though lol
<Dovah> those things were the "staw that broke the camels bakc" so to speak
<Dovah> straw8
<Kimori> How did they come up with all that?
<Dovah> *
<sagas> Dovah: I think that signals that you have a shitty router
<kirzstryfe> if it does, it never should have made it to 1k pages >.<
<Dovah> sagas: I do but it was fine befor then
<Reikim> The problem is, you have to clear those thousand.
<Reikim> It's like...a gradual upslope.
<sagas> Dovah: Mine has a laptop, xbox, ipod, kindle, wii
<Freefall29> Rex_Mundi: yeah. monster fighting is very possible and fun
<Reikim> Pain in the ass to climb.
<sagas> Dovah: all hooked up
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello everypony :)
<Reikim> And you can't take a faster way up, because otherwise it's not the same.

<kirzstryfe> hey Luna :)
<Kimori> and whats the point of the lsd game?
<Reikim> On the other hand, I completed that duty two years ago, and so I am beyond saving.
*kirzstryfe hugs LunaTheBeloved
<cades> apperently one of the guys that helped make the game kept a dream journal for 10 years. I guess they took some ideas from his dream journal
<Dovah> sagas: mine has xbox, wii ,laptop, desktop, kindle, iphone, ipad, and something else that i cant remember

<cachi01|mobile> Only triple if you are working or something
*tigher1001 hugs a derpy
<Reikim> Dunno 'bout Allegr0.
<shibaru> I like butts
<Reikim> And as DWR just confirmed, he used his massive amounts of cash to garner himself a spot.
<Ponies47> Flootahshy: I think double would be fine. Shizuka does it and she says it's great.
<DashWithRainbows> Cash?
<DashWithRainbows> Please, I bribed them with british things.
<Flootahshy> Ponies47: Then let the monitors be doubled!
<DashWithRainbows> Like tea and crumpets.
<Yahooz> and biscuits
<creeperhugger10> my name applies to MINECRAFT!!!!!! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
<DashWithRainbows> Saxy loves his crumpets.

<Reikim> Lies again, TheGreatAndPowerfulT, you are mistaken.
<Flootahshy> Wrek is a BAUS!
<Buytoast> does the league of legends community circlejerk around pictures of anthro humanoids eating shit out of diapers, lion king ocs standing in front of the 9/11 ruins or diaper fetishes?
<Reikim> I still retain my original soul.
<Rex_Mundi> tigher1001: Derpy wouldnt steel, you simply gave her your muffins.
<TheKatPony> well done Wrek.
<creeperhugger10> buytoast... yes... lul

<TheKatPony> Yup.
<Buytoast> that about sums up multiple communities sonny
<shibaru> I thought the spell was supposed to make her human, not evil demonic alien from planet anus. I mean wtf is with her face? How long has that thing been in the game? Did I accidentally download that??? Did the game glitch the textures??? Was this the result of the grey man raping missingno all over my furniture???

<Shizuka> 13nein... but i was at the state fair for about nine hours
<Shizuka> 13so tired...
<klaxa> i'll just ask this here: does anyone know whether or not you get some revenue on rebubble.com if someone buys a t-shirt with a print-template you provided?
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: i was close
<Dken2021> it's morning somewhere....
<klaxa> i mean has anyone used redbubble.com for that?
<DerpDash> btw everypony...ive been a member on bronystate for a short time now and im still wondering what does "glomp" mean?
<Meanwhile> should be the schlafen back on and go take a nap.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03DerpDash: I have no idea either... :S
<Shizuka> 13bronies... i am not sure whether to be disappoint or not... i did not see a single pony anything at the state fair today
<Dken2021> like an attack hug
<Reikim> Eyup.
<TheKatPony> a big hug :D
<LunaTheBeloved> Basically a really big super awesome hug

<Meanwhile> -and some form of handheld.
*Shizuka 13is probably burned
<klaxa> yeah sorry :P
<TheKatPony> lol
<Spectrum_Rush> all the way across the chat
<Shizuka> 13i burn badly..
<Dken2021> Shizuka no pony rides? at a state fair? odd
<Shizuka> 13and it was 84F and humid
<Buytoast> i thought the state fair was at the beginning of august
<LadyCanary> Oh dears.
<cachi01|mobile> klaxa i think you get 30% of the prize
<Meanwhile> Suncream?
<TheKatPony> NOTHING pony?
<Shizuka> 13Dken2021: not even a pony t-shirt
<Shizuka> 13not one
<TheKatPony> :O
<Reikim> Heat doesn't translate into burn, Shizu. Now I know you're tired.
<LunaTheBeloved> Suncream? You mean SunScreen?
<Spectrum_Rush> problem is there are many state fairs
<LadyCanary> ...BLASHPEMY SHIZU D:
<Shizuka> 13ja but didn't until i was out for like two hours
<cachi01|mobile> Its ok shizu neither i...
<Shizuka> 13but
<klaxa> cachi01|mobile: i see you're on a phone, can you provide me with a source link or keywords to google?
<shibaru> My boob feels awkward laying like this
<Shizuka> 13let me get pictures first
<Marx> Figure I'll toss out a reminder for Pokemon players: Starting tomorrow, an event begins involving the release of the event pokemon Keldeo. You have to go to Gamestop to pick him up, but yeah.
<Meanwhile> It's called suncream here.
<afKirz> brit-spaek
<Meanwhile> Or at least, that's what I call it.
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: wat you saw bronies?
<LunaTheBeloved> SunCream sounds like something made from parts of the sun
<Dken2021> Marx ah, that pony looking legendary
<oni_link> Marx is this for black and white?
<Shizuka> 13i didn't see any bronies
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<LunaTheBeloved> Creamed Sun
<Meanwhile> Cream of sun. For the coat like Celestia.
<Reikim> Heat translates into heat exhaustion...sunlight translates into burn.
<Shizuka> 13out of thousands und thousands of people
<Shizuka> 13no ponies
<NocturnalBlade> Marx: oh cool, havent had one of those in a while
<Reikim> You could get sunburned in the dead of winter in the middle of the snow. I'd know, I've done it.
<Marx> Dken2021, Eeyup. oni_link, Eeyup, and for Japanese Black 2 and White 2 if you have them.
<afKirz> 9 hours, wouldn't really matter for me if I had sunscreen or not, not that long
<Dken2021> welp, so much for that
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I wish I could tan
<TheKatPony> Shizuka: I feel you, there's like no bronies in my state :(
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'd like to toast a bit ;__;
<Meanwhile> I would hide in shade.
<afKirz> redheads don't tan, we burn >.<
<oni_link> Marx: awesome last time I was at gamestop to nab some pokemon I was getting the shiny Suicune, Raikou and Entei for the Celebi event :o
<TheKatPony> And when you do bring up My Little Pony, they think of the G2 or G1 ponies...
<LunaTheBeloved> Yeah for black heair and the ability to tan!
<LunaTheBeloved> *hair
<afKirz> :P
<cachi01|mobile> Same here kat
<SlurryMoon> 03 x3
<Reikim> I'd like to say I had black hair, but no, just this stupid almost-black.
<oni_link> TheKatPony: yeah, the media always does too
<Flootahshy> Da Faq?
<Ponies47> I just wanted to refresh and then my whole computer derps out. That was perdictable -_-
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm Hispanic, we either burn easily or have natural SPF 9000
<LadyCanary> ...Holy guacamole. o3o
<oni_link> also whoa, he ripped that duedes spine out :o
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^
<Marx> oni_link, I remeber that. Also unfortunately, the Keldeo event ends literally the day before Black 2 and White 2 are released in America.
<afKirz> lol
<Flootahshy> Well Done Wrek!
<Derpy_Hooves> LadyCanary: :3
<LunaTheBeloved> Actually my hair is no color
<Meanwhile> Dusty blonde hair, black facial hair. Go figure.
<Marx> Kinda crappy huh?
<cachi01|mobile> Mission accomplished
<LadyCanary> Hiya Derpy_Hooves ^_^ and YAY WREKY!!!

<LunaTheBeloved> I smell a hugfest!!
<Reikim> What are you laughing at there, Slurry?
<oni_link> Rex_Mundi: That stuff made me laugh though
*LunaTheBeloved hugs everypony
<Shizuka> 13mostly
<SlurryMoon> 03 hmm, yeah, I really don't like spending too much time outside down here in Texas
<Shizuka> 13wish i hadn't run out of ammo though

<LunaTheBeloved> Kill him
<Reikim> Well that sounds good
<CCCP> Hello Again :(
<Marx> I know. If they extended it 1 day more, I would have 4 of those guys.
<CCCP> hi Thrackerzod
<Reikim> The twisted bastard deserves it.
<LunaTheBeloved> I pretty much just killed everyone.
<oni_link> This looks fun , what am I watching exactly?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim try to find his room

<StinkomanFan> FLUTTERSHY LEVEL OF BRUTALITY
<Shizuka> 13so.. six years of playing stuff like doom, tf2, left 4 dead... this is what i get, without any useful sights: http://imgur.com/a/Zqy8U#0
<Marx> Dang.
<Reikim> So do I get anything if he dies? Other than satisfaction?
<Shizuka> 13http://imgur.com/a/Zqy8U#0 this was the high point about an hour ago
<BerryPunch> Title on imgur.com: State Fair marksmanship - Imgur

<LadyCanary> .....Daaaaaaaaaaaaaamn Shizu.
<TheKatPony> lol
<LadyCanary> ....Oh dang.
<oni_link> Shizuka: you have pretty fair groupings :)
<Reikim> Shizu...
<afKirz> what were you shooting with, and how much ammo did they give you?
<LunaTheBeloved> ^
<Flootahshy> Shizuka: What's with #3?
<PillowPoni> Shizuka: You have trained well?
<cachi01|mobile> Ouch

<Marx> On other Pokemon stuff, apparently all 3 event pokemon are already available in Japan.
<TheKatPony> ;)....?
<Spademagnes[R]> Hi
<Ponies47> Dang Shizuka O_O
<oni_link> Marx: which ones were those?
<cachi01|mobile> Hi spade :)
<TheKatPony> hey Spademagnes
<Ponies47> Hey Spademagnes[R]
<Shizuka> 13was a machine gun type firing BBs, dunno how many there were
<Spademagnes[R]> I dont plan on getting Adblock anytime soon but these Asian women ads look like total bullshit
<Shizuka> 13#3 was horrible cause it's air-powered, so the stupid target kept blowing around
<LunaTheBeloved> If it was at a state fair, and judging that some of the hits didn't go through, I would guess that it was probably just a BB gun
<Marx> Figure that means Meloeta and Genesect are coming to the US soon. No specific dates yet.
<CECtheRonin> Is this a video or are we actually streaming someone playing?
<oni_link> Shizuka: I need too find a fair that has those :O
<LunaTheBeloved> Or Pellet
<Shizuka> 13guy next to me had the tiniest sliver of red hanging on, the rest of his shots were dead on the center
<Spademagnes[R]> Dead
<CCCP> hello Spademagnes[R] :s
<cachi01|mobile> CECtheRonin wrek is playing
<Shizuka> 13ja was a machine gun type BB gun
<Shizuka> 13air powered, so the target kept blowing around
<Spademagnes[R]> Chunky
<LunaTheBeloved> Okay.
<CECtheRonin> cachi01|mobile Wrek dies a lot.
<Spademagnes[R]> Save scumming eh?
<Shizuka> 13was supposed to have a laser pointer but they were all broken :<
<TheKatPony> very chunky
<Marx> oni_link, Japan has Keldeo, Meloetta, and Genesect already.
<cachi01|mobile> Yeah lol
<oni_link> Marx: oh THOSE! I have Meloetta but because I gave in and cheated and did an IP/ GTS mod
<LunaTheBeloved> Don't trust the laser pointer at a State Fair shotting booth
<afKirz> anything that shoots more than one in rapid succession is going to be less accurrate >.<
<Shizuka> 13and the ironsights were worthless cause when i tried it the BB went way off to the corner on #1
<cachi01|mobile> Huzza for action replay
<CCCP> :'( waaaa
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: Could you post that image again? My chat derped.
<Spademagnes[R]> FORE!
<Dken2021> I hate pokemon events, they're so rare
<Shizuka> 13i was doing it the same way i do in l4d though, short controlled burts
<LunaTheBeloved> Smart
<Shizuka> 13http://imgur.com/a/Zqy8U#0

<Spademagnes[R]> Gibs everywhere!
<oni_link> I tricked the global trade center! instead of connecting to its main servers, I made it connect to a website that delivers pokemon through DNS :D
<cachi01|mobile> Nice
<Phase4> 00,02ohai cachi01|mobile
<Ponies47> Sup Phase4
<TheKatPony> oh hey Phase4

<LunaTheBeloved> Well anyway, I was only getting on for the night, but I'll be back on more now
<Dken2021> allo Phase4
<Dovah> is my computer still being retarted or is chat just slow?
<LunaTheBeloved> Night guys, and Cello Phase4
<Spademagnes[R]> Why would you fire a ROCKET AT CLOSE RANGE
<cachi01|mobile> Chat slow
<thelonepony> hai Phase4
<TheKatPony> Chats a bit slow

<oni_link> cachi01|mobile: INDEED :D
<CCCP> night LunaTheBeloved
<Reikim> So I killed Cohen, but now I can't find his body.
<Shizuka> 13was funny though cause other than a guy who looked like he could be an actual marksman, i was the only one there not just spraying the whole clip and hoping something hit
<TheKatPony> I love the fuck yourself thing LOL
*LunaTheBeloved settles back into her lazy boy recliner
<LunaTheBeloved> Its good to be home\
<oni_link> Shizuka: short controlled bursts? :3
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Wrek> in otehr words
<Spademagnes[R]> So much save scumming
<Shizuka> 13but air powered so the target tended to get blown around
<Wrek> if there was a zombie apokalypse
<Wrek> id have shizu on my team<3
<oni_link> whooo! you deserve a muffin Shizuka
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night LunaTheBeloved
*LunaTheBeloved hugs everypony
<cachi01|mobile> Game crashed?
<Spademagnes[R]> erm... crash?
<Dken2021> paused
<TheKatPony> apokalypse XD
<Shizuka> 13which ruined my aim further... didn't help that you can't actually see the BBs, and that the laser pointer you were supposed to have was broken, and the ironsights were useless
<oni_link> cachi01|mobile: no he was talking to shizu :P
<cachi01|mobile> Oh lol
<Reikim> All right, night Luna...dammit
<Spademagnes[R]> Do you know how sad it is to see so much saving?

<AJIsAwesome> Stupid internet.
<Meanwhile> Or Rei is slow.
<oni_link> Shizuka: Im surprised they tore through the targets tbh :D
<TheKatPony> just give em the finger
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim i think to get into cohen rooms you had to let him live not sure but killing him feels good
<Shizuka> 13well it's flimsy paper :3
<Dken2021> Spademagnes[R] love to do that, I just need to know how to join a server
<Spademagnes[R]> CHUNKY
<Spademagnes[R]> SO much blood!
<JappleAck> STILL DOOM

<Spademagnes[R]> FIRE
<LadyCanary> Oh mai.

<Spademagnes[R]> Wrek got fired
<cachi01|mobile> Theres a multiplayer megaman?
<CECtheRonin> Hey Wrek, you're on fire.
<LadyCanary> :O DeadpoolDash!! Hi you!
<robotdragon9> i was just shooting my airsoft in the basement lol
<TheKatPony> you dont say?
<oni_link> cachi01|mobile: MM9 DeathMatch, its an FPS i think
<DeadpoolDash> hi LadyCanary!
<LadyCanary> Burn baby burn~
<Shizuka> 13there was another game there with air pistols firing corks at slowly moving targets, but you have to hit four targets with four shots in order to win anything... first shot went higher than i wanted but on the lateral i was aiming, second shot hit, third shot hit, fourth decided to be evil and go wide...
<Spademagnes[R]> STOP FIRING CLOSE RANGE ROCKETS
<Shizuka> 13but i got a little stuffed goldfish out of it
<TheKatPony> Where was this at, Shizuka?
<cachi01|mobile> Fak u im doom guy i can do what i want
<Shizuka> 13minnesota state fair
<Dken2021> cachi01|mobile ya, a Doom mod with a mega man theme and you can use all the weapons from 1-8
<TheKatPony> Ah.
<Ponies47> I skipped the fair this year. For my brats of step sisters and brother we're here when it came around. So they went and I stayed home.
<CCCP> :'( i hate everything
<robotdragon9> i taught this guy how to do this
<Ponies47> CCCP: So you hate us? :'(
<TheKatPony> I was gonna go to that, but the way you're describing it makes me happy I didnt
<Barbetos> Good thing it was not a pony that you could win.
<Barbetos> That guy would of had all your monies
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: We love you, too.:)
<cachi01|mobile> CCCP and ponies?
<Dken2021> something ok CCCP?
<CCCP> Ponies47 no, You hate ME
<Shizuka> 13but kind of like driving.. i know i would have a looong way to go to actually be proficient, but i am glad my years of gaming are actually developing the skills you use in game
<DeadpoolDash> My state fair wasn't worth me driving 200 miles for.
<Shizuka> 13sharpshooting, driving, etc
<Reikim> Also: rescue all the girls.
<oni_link> Shizuka: stuffed goldfihs, heck yeah!! I dont like BBs/Airsoft pistols, if you dont get good barells on those things or a decent reloading mechanism, youre gonna have a bad time :D
<oni_link> *goldfish
<Ponies47> CCCP: That's not true! Your my friend!
<Spademagnes[R]> Some one get a mop
<the_real_pony_1604> I always hated those fire things when I played doom back in the day
<Kandarihu> Judging distances?
<cachi01|mobile> GTA showed me how to drive.......
<Shizuka> 13so kids, if your mom ever barks at you for playing too much tf2, just tell her you'll win a gigantic stuffed pig at a state fair someday
<TheKatPony> Shizuka: was it at the Target Center?
<Ponies47> <3
<Spademagnes[R]> YES PUNCH THE FIRE DEMON
<Spademagnes[R]> Make it hurt
<cachi01|mobile> The bad thing....... Lots of people get hurt lol
<Shizuka> 13no state fair, over in falcon heights
<Barbetos> Whats the matter CCCP?
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, hahaha!
<oni_link> dat moral of the stor hahaha :D
<Shizuka> 13by the u of m
<TheKatPony> Oh okay
<oni_link> *story
<Spademagnes[R]> Kick
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did you shoot around the edge of the star?
<Spademagnes[R]> SO MUCH BLOOD
<TheKatPony> god, Wrek.
<Spademagnes[R]> Slash, swipe
<cachi01|mobile> KICK ALL THE CORPES!
<Ponies47> Shizuka: Nice. Nah. My folks don't mind. But my dad did say somthing when I was playing 1 time and I head shot a Scout when I was Sniper :S
<Shizuka> 13i tried, #5 was my best since i was getting used to how it handled, going straight for the center with enough shot seemed to tear out a good bit of the edge
<Kandarihu> This Plutonia. Is it a DOOM 2 Mod?
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: What did he day?
<Shizuka> 13where they get you is you'll have the tiniest bit of red left just as your ammo runs out
<AJIsAwesome> *say*
<oni_link> Ponies47: my dad used to get disgusted when I would pop heads in Gears of War 1 with the sniper :D
<cachi01|mobile> Kandarihu i think its ultimate doom mod
<Dken2021> ooh, that is con worthy
<Kandarihu> cachi01|mobile, ah, okay.
<robotdragon9> i was playin mass effect 2 an hour or so ago...first team member i went to get was grunt. krogans are cool.
<cachi01|mobile> Get that sasha
<Shizuka> 13it was extra evil cause there's no audible difference in the clicking between "i fired a pellet" and "i fired nothing".. so you don't actually know when you've run out, other than nothing seems to be happening on the paper
<TheKatPony> oh wow ^^
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: Ah he just said that it's not ok to shot people in real life and syuch. He would know because he was in the Air Force and shot off plenty of guns and such.
<DerpyMuffins> Is Wrek still streaming?
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Ok.
<TheKatPony> Yes he is
<Ponies47> oni_link: I see
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: Yes.
<DerpyMuffins> How long has he been playing Doomguy?
<Spademagnes[R]> I would hate to be the janitor of this place
<oni_link> ^ ^ ^
<Dken2021> so much red indeed
<TheKatPony> A while
<robotdragon9> Spademagnes ummm.....i quit
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: He's played it for a couple hours.
<Shizuka> 13i'm apparently good at sharpshooting but i know i throw like a girl... so i didn't try the "hit three milk bottles" thing
<Shizuka> 13if i'd have won that, i would have a massive massive spherical stuffed pig
<Shizuka> 13thing is like a meter round...
<Reikim> Should've gotten someone else to do it for you.
<oni_link> Why do all these things insist on carrying ketchup bottles on them? They know those things will shatter and get messy :D
<sub06905|Gamecube> all dem bodies
<cachi01|mobile> BRB dinner
<Shizuka> 13it's a carnival game so it's of course fairly rigged, the softball isn't quite big enough to knock them down with a straight shot, you have to come down at an angle
<robotdragon9> *watches gory game*= dinner time
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: It's french fry night.:D
<TheKatPony> I love it when he kicks them XD
<Meanwhile> I hate those things.
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: hahaha makes sense, they wanna be prepared. So much ketchup though!
<Kandarihu> Yeah, it's almost time for my dinner too.
<otakon1> I'm back what's up?
<TheKatPony> welcome back
<otakon1> Wrek is still on his Doom binge huh?
<Reikim> They're all rigged completely.
<Meanwhile> Which is why most of the fairs I went to involved taking turns to distract the folks on the games while someone else makes off with the fluffy stuff.
<Ponies47|Shower> BRB shower
<LadyCanary> Yus.
<robotdragon9> dat nosebleed
<TheKatPony> yep
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm the only one with invader zim in the mind after reading massive spherical pig ?
<PillowPoni> otakon: Yep
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: I know people who DRENCH their ribs in barbecue sauce.:D
<Reikim> Wait what Meanwhile
<Shizuka> 13the rifle game cost roughly $3 a go.. so probably good i only had enough tickets to take five shots at it
<TheKatPony> big fucking gun XD
<otakon> hiya LadyCanary good to see you in irc :P
<Shizuka> 13TheGreatAndPowerfulT: IKR
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Welcome back!
<Shizuka> 13i was so disappointed in this generation that no one was making zim jokes
<Spademagnes[R]> About time
<Meanwhile> Reikim: We nicked the prizes. Basically.
<Shizuka> 13state fair is great... and a little depressing... for people watching
<Reikim> Wow, conning the cons.
<Reikim> \
<Spademagnes[R]> Dead

<Meanwhile> I'm not proud of it but if you're going to steal money from the community I'm going to steal your stuffed Winnie the Pooh.
<LadyCanary> Shizu Shizu ^o^
<Reikim> Loved that show, but not enough to crack jokes at thought of stuffed pig. It came into my mind, however.
<Wrek> well ive been at this for a while
<Shizuka> 13if i'd thought of it i would have brought my camera to get a shot of the pigs... they were seriously huge
<Shizuka> 13<3
<Wrek> you guys still enjoyign DOOM?
<Reikim> Why Pooh bear Meanwhile? I mean...anything better?
<robotdragon9> this is almost as violent as my family gatherings
<Meanwhile> Been too long since I've seen Invader Zim.

<Meanwhile> Squidhat?
<Reikim> Squid hats.
<TheKatPony> Same here ^^
<LadyCanary> Because he's motherbucking Wrek.
<robotdragon9> i dont know how ANYPONY does it
<oni_link|backup> robotdragon9: if its something you really like, you dont notice the time go by :D
<Ninjazz|Modding> Squid hats with massive pig backpacks?
<Shizuka> 13squidhat
<LadyCanary> He's bumtased his way through worse.
<WalkerPony89> robotdragon9: It's simple, really; because Wrek isn't human
<Reikim> Those are cool now?
<Meanwhile> I can't claim to know much about fashion but never did I think I'd hear that squidhats were in.
<robotdragon9> true and true
<Shizuka> 13no one at the fair understood me offering buds for them either :<
<AJIsAwesome> I know some people here loved Hey You! Pikachu, but did anyone besides me love Pokemon Channel?
<WalkerPony89> I'm not saying he's an alien...
<WalkerPony89> But he's an alien
<Rex_Mundi> Is Wrek really a Unicorn?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol maybe Wrek IS the DOOM GUY?
<Meanwhile> Trade you a Shako for it.
<Spademagnes[R]> JESUS
<WalkerPony89> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Mother of God...
<Kandarihu> Some people can focus on this some just can't. Wrek's human, but he's hardcore.
<Shizuka> 13most of the hat stands had a sign out saying "please do not take photos with the hats"
<oni_link|backup> AJIsAwesome: Pokemon channel? Sounds familiar
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> make a squid hat and put it in tf2 workshop.. ?????.. profit.
<Shizuka> 13and i'm thinking why not, if you buy it you're going to take one picture and never wear it again anyway
<TheKatPony> good god
<robotdragon9> PLOT TWIST: wrek is the doom guy who is actually an alien unicorn
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: DOOM GUY hangs a picture of Wrek on his wall for inspiration.
<cachi01|mobile> Pokemon channel???? Is that about digimon or what?
<Rex_Mundi> Maybe... maybe, wrek is jesus, who is also an Alicorn AND is also the real doom guy.
<Meanwhile> Probably because they know that's what you'd do as well.
<cades> sooooooooooooooo boooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeed

<otakon> jesus
<mitamaking> man that is a lot of lag
<otakon> 20 seconds
<TheKatPony> Yes ^^
<VenHur> Who is Doomguy? Most deffinetly Wrek.
<WalkerPony89> Rex_Mundi: Eeyup
<LadyCanary> Oh, Rex_Mundi, no need to put the @ or % at the beginning of the mod's names ^_^ just type their names and they'll hear the ping
<otakon> it that just for me or everyone?
<AJIsAwesome> So Chuck Norris hangs a picture of Doom Guy on his wall who hangs a picture of Wrek on his wall for inspiration.
<TheKatPony> Its for everyone
<Meanwhile> You think they're creepy? Have you ever even seen the spider splicers?
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: lol
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: I hear the pings.
<mitamaking> wait what are the pings for now
<PillowPoni> AJIsAwesome: Yep

<TheKatPony> the pings are like 5 seconds delayed
<Spademagnes[R]> SMOOTH
<PillowPoni> NIce
<TheKatPony> which means, there is alot of lag
<sub06905|Gamecube> ded
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: no not the sound, the lenght of time before the ping goes
<Reikim> Spider splicers I can deal with.
<NocturnalBlade> well there's your problem
*Ninjazz|Modding shudders.

<Reikim> You can try to hit them, but they'll just turn to red mist and disappear
<Reikim> Voices everywhere
<mitamaking> Shizuka: It's Vodemort, he is killing
<PillowPoni> Shizuka: Potter.
<otakon> Shizuka is best Harriette Potter

<Rex_Mundi> Yay, staying home because your sick is the only good part of being sick. haha screw jobcorps, I get to talk to you guys about ponies!:D
<otakon> mitamaking: LORD MOLDYBUTT!

<Dovah> *sigh*
<Ryunosuke> i'm just not a TF2 fan myself
<Rex_Mundi> Wrek is in gaming mode, this is like playing the legond of zelda at college in the 80s, or so I imagine it is like that. me being an 90s kid and all. (age 22)
<robotdragon9> 14

<TheKatPony> oh shir XD
<Daygon> DAYUM
<Athgaar> it's not funny if it's actual gameplay

<Reikim> I'm kind of disappointed. Here I thought I was finally one of the cool kids, and now I find out it was a ruse all along.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> vintage flare gun 16.5 refined wtf
<Daygon> lol

<otakon> LOL!

<RaveBrony> Meh, even if i were to enter a call, my younger brother wouldnt shut up long enough for me to have even a short convo =_(\
<Meanwhile> It's funny because it's true.
<otakon> that was me earlier when playing as the Engi
<otakon> Spy
<Daygon> spy

<TheKatPony> XD
<Wrek> Pyrous by 69Starmix96
<otakon> thanks man
<Meanwhile> Since I stated that I use the skype one in /here/

<Daygon> LOL
<RaveBrony> Meanwhile just feels bad for us still in here, so he chats in here too :D
<Rex_Mundi> this is funny?
<Reikim> So this room is slowly dying. Or has been, long before I ever got here.
<oni_link|backup> lol
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<TheKatPony> xD
<Shizuka> 13ded
<VenHur> Don't know if this is disturbing...or hilariously awesome.
<Shizuka> 13maybe it will live again once the season kicks in and we have zillions of viewers
<Celes_Chere> Rex_Mundi: not so much funny as absurd. For some it's one in the same.
<Reikim> Hence the frequent cardiac arrests and subsequent resuscitations.
<TheKatPony> Maybe i just love comentaters
<RaveBrony> Yeah
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Everyone has different tastes.
<Spademagnes[R]> Erm
<Dken2021> but yea, the two teams, red and blue, are mercenaries hired from two fighting brothers
<Reikim> ...Well, whatever, I kind of like it like this.
<TheKatPony> LOL
<Shizuka> 13you remember the stats from the finale right?
<oni_link|backup> TheKatPony: i do too :P
<Dken2021> that's the jist of it really
<Reikim> It's not stupidly busy like manechat, it's not annoying, and when it does kick it's amusing.
<TheKatPony> LOL
<RaveBrony> Lolwut
<Shizuka> 13at least for our site, we had 15,000 unique visitors and over 75,000 hits in half an hour
<Spademagnes[R]> Wat
<SaxyPretender> 0,14to summarize
<Meanwhile> I have no idea. I was in London during the finale.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14shit was crazy
<Reikim> And I can also rant to myself for as long as I want here and pretend people are listening.
<Daygon> GO JESUS
<Daygon> lol
<DerpyMuffins> I just refresh my EQD tab
<TheKatPony> lol
<DerpyMuffins> Veggie is gone
<Meanwhile> I'm listening.
<TheKatPony> Yep :(
<thelonepony> wat? :(
<Reikim> Halfways.
<VenHur> DerpyMuffins: OH GOD THE HUMANITY!
<RaveBrony> :P
<DerpyMuffins> Sad to see him go
<TheKatPony> VenHur; XD
<Reikim> Hey, whatever, it beats talking to myself. I get a lot less weird looks.
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: IKR?:(
<TheKatPony> omg LOL
<Shizuka> 13oh that's why i kept seeing pyros using powerjack for mvm
<Shizuka> 13not much downside if you balance with health regen
<RaveBrony> Heh.
<Meanwhile> Hey the trade thingy on steam works for in game stuff too doesn't it?
<Sumica> 00,10for the tanks Shizuka?
<RaveBrony> but yeah, i do like when the caht is slow like this.
<Daygon> so

<Daygon> albino turtle
<otakon> Caravan Palace - Bambous the song from that one video

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile yep
<otakon> thanks again for the stream Wrek
<magmablock> Health on kill is probably the most valuable upgrade a pyro can get in MvM
<Athgaar> 75, not 75%
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: Thank you!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile well just with some games
<Meanwhile> Well it's trade basically but my particular brand of speech means I must add the word "thingy"
<magmablock> that and resistances
<TheKatPony> That was funny. Thanks for the stream Wrek :)
<Shizuka> 13sorry +75
<Wrek> a sniper that can aim is OP on MvM

<Wrek> 900 dmg a hit on the supers
<Sumica> 00,10oh btw Shizuka, I found out the tanks have thinner armor in the back
<Reikim> Or something else that vaguely translates as "brit slang"
<oni_link|backup> Wrek: like yourself :D
<Rex_Mundi> Is the stream over?
<Meanwhile> You only just figured that out Sumica?
<VenHur> Tanks are Turtles
<Wrek> yes im goign to bed now

<Reikim> It is not your fault that this Skype group exists.

<Reikim> It is the fault of fate.
<Dken2021> yup, endless link from here on out
<Reikim> Clearly the hand of fate dictated the group's existence.
<Polydunami|DW> I won't be talkative right now
<Malk> Black Dynamite
<NocturnalBlade> eeyup
<mitamaking> Spademagnes[R]: Thank you, I wanted to be forced to play KH again

<Yahooz> yeah
<Reikim> What's that in Celsius?
<TheKatPony> Night Wrek, thanks for streaming
<oni_link|backup> Spademagnes[R]: oh this theme >.>
<Shizuka> 13a thousand
<Shizuka> 1332F is 0C so
<Reikim> Lies, I know it's lower than that

<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<Reikim> Wait, what

<SaxyPretender> 0,14TWITTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER
<Shizuka> 13ikr
<Yahooz> methinks?
<Reikim> 0C
<oni_link|backup> would you guys reccomend Dream Drop Distance?
<Reikim> Absolutely nothing.
<Spademagnes[R]> I liked it
<Shizuka> 13i don't put on a jacket until 30-40F
<Yahooz> thats a given
<Shizuka> 13even then i don't go into bundle up mode until it's closer to like 10F
*SaxyPretender has been known to be out in the snow without a jacket on
<Malk> PillowPoni Barbaque
<Reikim> Try -20C and see how cold really is.
<Yahooz> ive gone shirtless in 5F
<oni_link|backup> i played it a bit, it was significantly harder Spademagnes[R]
<Reikim> Then try -30C and feel your brain freezing.
<Shizuka> 13i think this past winter it almost broke -20F
<Shizuka> 13which is
<Malk> oni_link you didnt remind me
<PillowPoni> Malk: DYNAMITE DYNAMITE
<Shizuka> 13-28C
<Dken2021> anyone heard of that TWEWY iOS port?
<Malk> MR.T
<Shizuka> 13it was well below 0F for most of january
<oni_link|backup> Malk: I just saw you right now!
<Reikim> So it was a mid-Canadian winter.
<Yahooz> heh, -40F = -40C
<Malk> you want barbaque sause PillowPoni?
<Reikim> Yes, the Fahrenheit scale is notoriously strange.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/1727_56418046100_3520_n.jpg
<oni_link|backup> hows the progress so far Malk ?
<Yahooz> because MERICUH
<TheKatPony> no ones streaming, right? o.o
<Dovah> ok I think I got my internet fix (for now)
<Dovah> fixed*
<oni_link|backup> TheKatPony: nope
<Reikim> At least Celsius makes sense, I mean, they found something and made a measurement.
<Yahooz> Saxy geting super'd by Frost
<Shizuka> 13despite all the arguments for metrication of temperature, i'll keep fahrenheit for everyday use
<Rex_Mundi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLVuM140HbI
<Shizuka> 13you don't need decimal points for it
<Spademagnes[R]> Does anyone else here read that My Little Caboose: Blue is magic fanfic? I like it
<Malk> Idk oni_link
<mitamaking> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV_0n5gp1fE&feature=bf_next&list=FLPN5DjWyWmPMRIRo4tnD6gw
<AJIsAwesome> Am I the only one who doesn't like Tron?
<Shizuka> 13a single degree fahrenheit is more granular than a single degree celsius
<mitamaking> AJIsAwesome: I liked it
<mitamaking> so yes
<Reikim> Oh hey, another stoner Saxy
<Shizuka> 13for science, sure, you had better be using a scale calibrated to stuff you'll actually use, like water
<TheKatPony> AJIsAwesome: No, you're not
<Dovah> AJIsAwesome: never seen it but it doesnt look all that apealing to me
<Spademagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2s9GH1HZKA&list=PL297445C6A3381D39&index=36&feature=plpp_video Tron world!
<Yahooz> dont even get us started on Kelvin...
<Reikim> Also you don't need decimals for Celsius everyday use.
<Meanwhile> Personally I'm content to say "It's cold" or "It's warm" or "My face is melting" for temperature related issues.
<Reikim> Hell, I get along just fine without decimals.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm not that stoner looking ;_________;
<Malk> hey grew a hair
<Yahooz> dude wheres my jacket
<Malk> he
<Reikim> And if you can't work in decimals you're slow.
<Yahooz> lel
<Reikim> Also yes Saxy you look stoned.
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: It's okay. But Disney keeps shoving it down our throats. I wasn't interested in the movie to see it.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14LIES
<TheKatPony> OH I know ^^
<Yahooz> you havent seen stoned until Meanwhile links that pic
<Shizuka> 13only place we use decimals in fahrenheit tends to be when checking fever temperature
<mitamaking> I haven't seen Legacy, I was talking about the original
<Yahooz> which i know he will
<Malk> BLACK DYNAMITE THE MOVIE
<Meanwhile> I'd have linked it already but the site is slow.
<Shizuka> 13cause that extra 0.1 degree fahrenheit is the difference between getting out of school and going while feeling ill
<PillowPoni> Malk: they showin the black dynamite movie next Sunday at 1130. ALL MY MONEEEEEYYY
<Yahooz> Meanwhile: but i knew you were in the process of doing so :3
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/c3prC.jpg
<mitamaking> As opposed to Black Dynamite the cereal
<Yahooz> see?

<AJIsAwesome> Athgaar: Yes.

<RaveBrony> O_o
<TheKatPony> Ponies47: Exactly what i'm doing lol
<Reikim> Sorry, Saxy, but you really do have this weird ability for looking stoned.
<Meanwhile> It'd be better if you were trying to scoop orange with a bit of jello.

<Marx> It is August 27th, so as of now, Keldeo is officially released in North America. Europe has to wait until September 1st, for their chance to get Keldeo. North America now as 647 Pokemon to catch.
<Rex_Mundi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JdXkxBuK5Y&feature=plcp
<TheKatPony> It's still the 26th here ^_^
<mitamaking> Kaldeo is out, to Gamestop tommorow
<Yahooz> im okay with sharing pics, but only when its appropriate
<Spademagnes[R]> I wish I could get Keldeo :(
<Spademagnes[R]> I don't live anywhere near a Gamestop
<mitamaking> Now if only we could get the robot
<Reikim> The odd part is a lot of people who seem like stoners...aren't actually stoners.
<Spademagnes[R]> Sigh
<Meanwhile> Is when someone else is doing it appropriate?
<Yahooz> idk
<Yahooz> maybe
<mitamaking> Back to Kingdom Hearts http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOSNIIx5u_U&feature=bf_next&list=FLPN5DjWyWmPMRIRo4tnD6gw
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/dSv0s.png I should update that. Since I have more hair now and my beard is thinner.
<Marx> We still have to wait for Gamestop to open today though.
<Reikim> Especially among the artists. Very few of them actually do suspicious materials. Which is actually scarier, because it means they're naturally fucked in the head.
<oni_link|backup> otakon: shut up and take my money
<mitamaking> Marx, I can live that long
<Spectrum_Rush> whys it always gots to be gamestop, for the love of god i like for once to beable to get my pokes with out being stared at

<Meanwhile> When I went to London I had people ask me for pictures purely for moustache sake.

<Marx> A little info on Keldeo: He is the fourth member of the Coballion/Virizion/Terrakion group, and features his own move, Secret Sword, an attack not even the other 3 can learn!
<Spademagnes[R]> The chance of me getting Keldeo is slim to none
<otakon> oh my god
<RaveBrony> Only time ive seen Meanwhile was on the stream :D
<otakon> that last video is hilarious
<RaveBrony> That 'Ask the mods' bit
<Yahooz> oh yeaaaaah
<Marx> He also looks very similar to a pony.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14SWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG

<Meanwhile> Do you have a pic shirtless?
<otakon> he's a BLOODY PONY
<Yahooz> goddamn its the circle of lif

<Yahooz> *life
<Dken2021> eeyup
<Yahooz> Meanwhile: lemme check
<Spademagnes[R]> And I will never get him! Fucking hell
<mitamaking> One of the best Disney songs in my opinion
<Tovlurk> I feel indifferent towards Keldeo since he can't learn Ice Beam
<otakon> dammit where is the godzilla of the mix?
<shibaru> My eyes are all asdfghjkl
<mitamaking> otakon: Charizard?
<otakon> no

<Kimori> hey
<Ponies47> Dangit. Did Saturn leave? -_-
<Dovah> Spademagnes[R]: I dont even know what Keldeo is :$
<Dken2021> if I had my DS, I would've just used pokesav to save some time

<DerpyMuffins> Bye everypony I got AP Enlgish homework that is due in 4 hours

<shibaru> Why am I seeing whitw spots all over the pkace
<Reikim> I have a habit of immediately disposing of any picture that get taken of myself.
<Spademagnes[R]> At least we get Mew for free..
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: Bye!
<mitamaking> Bronystate must show Tutu
<Dken2021> free mew?
<Reikim> It couples well with my habit of avoiding pics at any opportunity.
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: At least you got Mew.......
<Unnr> mitamaking: I love how it starts off all sugar and fluff
<Meanwhile> So you're the Tall Guy from SCP.
<Unnr> then goes O_O
<Ponies47> Bronystate is Bronystate
<Spademagnes[R]> There was a contest for a bracket it was close competion between Rayquaza and Mew
<Meanwhile> I think it's the Tall Guy anyway.
<mitamaking> Ponies47: okay
<mitamaking> so?
<Spademagnes[R]> Mew won and will be available via wifi Sept 6
<Reikim> Dunno, I haven't browsed that in years.
<Spademagnes[R]> And apperenty it gets a shirt too
<mitamaking> Dang it why did Deoxys not win?
<Spademagnes[R]> for merch
<sub06905|GTA_4> woot i get another mew then
<Eulshy> How to get keldeo?
<Reikim> All I know is, pictures of myself are not good.
<shibaru> I'm having a hard time evern seeing my hands o_o
<Dken2021> wait, people voted for rayquaza? geez, you get him like in 3 different situations, while mew was only available twice in pokemon history
<AJIsAwesome> Yes! Another chance to get Mew!
<Reikim> There's maybe one or two of me from the last two years or so.
<Meanwhile> I figured that inevitably I will have my picture taken, so I might as well try and look decent for them.
<mitamaking> How did Dwoxys not win?
<mitamaking> *Deoxys
<Reikim> Hence the eyebrow quirk.
<Spademagnes[R]> The only legendaries I have yet to aquire are Celibi, Deyoxs...and i think thats it
<Spademagnes[R]> I have a Jirachi
<mitamaking> We have NEVER gotten him
<RaveBrony> I was just about to say, lol
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: Mew had less releases than Deoxys.
<Spademagnes[R]> I have two darkarai
<Reikim> And the moustache quirk.
<Ponies47> Looking forward to getting a new computer in about the next week or so. Been needing a new one for a while. Hope this one will be able to run TF2 good so I can play with the rest of you. :)
<Tovlurk> I think Deoxy is in Pokemon Ranger along with Manaphy
<mitamaking> Darkrai would be nice too
<Meanwhile> Actually I've not been able to stop doing that for just about every face I pull for a decade.
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: We did. Pokemon Ranger.
<Yahooz> ...not any good ones on my computer
<Dken2021> I had a celebi, then my friend restarted my soulslver
<Spademagnes[R]> Darkrai was available for wifi
<Reikim> Seriously, it looks like you're mid-wriggle with that thing.
<Meanwhile> Once upon a time you see...
<Spademagnes[R]> Awhile ago
<mitamaking> I have Celebi, such an awesome event
<oni_link|backup> Ponies47: did you decide if youre getting a laptop or desktop?
<sub06905|GTA_4> i still need a darkrai :|
<Meanwhile> I used to play a lot of Smackdown vs Raw games and wanted to make my eyebrow move like The Rock's.
<AJIsAwesome> I'm glad I got Celebi.
<thelonepony> i want a mew :(
<Marx> Wow, Dken. Don't know what to say to that...
<mitamaking> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK7XwLbd-oI&feature=related And now cliché song everypony likes
<RaveBrony> :D
<Meanwhile> So I lay in bed wiggling my eyebrows for several hours until I got it.
<VenHur> I have a SHINY Ponta in Diamond Version...that's right, I got a SHINY Ponyta, your arguement is invalid.
<Spademagnes[R]> I have a shiny groudon
<Reikim> Oh. You had to work at that?
<Dken2021> Marx also had a shiny ditto too, but I lost that too ;_;
<Meanwhile> But now I can't help but do it for just about everything.
<Ponies47> oni_link|backup: It's going to be...(pause for dramtic effect) A... (Zelda music here) DESKTOP!

<Meanwhile> Not a very imposing sounding curse is it.
<thelonepony> and now Stream!
<twilight_sprinkle> dat slight buzzing sound means its SB stream
<VenHur> Oh, hello XBOX 360... wait, this is new.

<oni_link> VenHur: I agree
<mitamaking> He's no biologist
<Dovah> who is chef's VA?
<thelonepony> only chef the smartest character
<TheKatPony> Wonder why...
<oni_link> Dovah: Isaac Hayes
<Ponies47> oni_link: IKR?
<Dovah> ah
<Spademagnes[R]> Revenge

<Reikim> Hehe, dirty rarity colours
<Spectrum_Rush> he learned well
<Shizuka> 13like half a second from hitting publish
<otakon> seriously HOW do they mistake CARTMAN for a ethiopean?
<oni_link> Ponies47: :D oh my... they actually took cartman instead of marvin
<Dken2021> oh a lottery finally
<Shizuka> 13friday's
<Shizuka> 13we're a little slow lately
<oni_link> otakon: because its south park

<Reikim> Dari's scripts are efficient, I see.
<otakon> last fridays
<Cypresswolf> this cant possible go wrong
<otakon> TURKEYS!
<Shizuka> 13oh look i forgot to categorize.... inb4 a duplicate notice from daribot
<mitamaking> Oh look it is the turkeys
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: No problem. Take your time.:)
<TheKatPony> ohhh shhhiiitt
<otakon> GET THE FLAMETHROWERS!
<Kandarihu> Dat typo
*NocturnalBlade panics
<oni_link> otakon: mmmph mmph!!!!
<mitamaking> Is that the sequel to Dragon Wars?
<thelonepony> tin cans fly around in the box
<Kandarihu> otakon, probably afraid of being accused of racism
<Shizuka> 13hm maybe not this time, guess it only re-sends the notice if i change the post text, categories don't count
<Shizuka> 13makes sense, categories won't affect the RSS it reads
<otakon> wait wait
<oni_link> part 14 :D
<otakon> poor Chief Running Wolf
<Shizuka> 1390% certain it works off watching our RSS feed, like EQD
<RaveBrony> :o
<mitamaking> part 14?
<otakon> Jesus
<TheKatPony> XD
<oni_link> :D
<mitamaking> Serves Cartman right

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Spademagnes[R]: prince-dari isn't here right now >>
<thelonepony> do u guys here that >_>
<VenHur> Cartman = Best Character
<otakon> no
<Shizuka> 13berrypunch just fires when it sees a link
<Spademagnes[R]> Shizuka: then how do you do the lotto?
<Shizuka> 13survey
<mitamaking> Over the Hedge as an A movie though?
<Shizuka> 13but the two go hand in hand
<oni_link> I like butters, Stan, and cartman the most
<Shizuka> 13we send newsletters via survey app
<Kandarihu> Spademagnes[R], were you not here last Friday?
<Ponies47> I'm a freakin pig. Every time I get a can of Pringles I always eat ALL of them in 1 day o~o
<Dovah> oh god
<mitamaking> :(
<Spademagnes[R]> Kandarihu: No i was not
<Shizuka> 13no newsletter, no survey, at least not recently
<TheKatPony> lol
<VenHur> I know it's has a 6.9 rating, but...dear god, why?
<Dovah> inb4 kenny ded
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<Shizuka> 13if we're still having trouble this week i'll make sure we get a survey out anyway
<thelonepony> flying cans is best idea
<NocturnalBlade> Ponies47: me too lol...you cant just have one XD
<Kandarihu> Spademagnes[R], they did it the old fashioned way with a new twist
<Spademagnes[R]> Oh shit
<oni_link> Ponies47: im like that with pringles too ;~;
<Ponies47> NocturnalBlade: IKR?
<superretroworld> xD
<Spectrum_Rush> Ponies47 pls, i'll end up finishing one in less than 30 minutes
<RaveBrony> When was Berrypunch added?
<mitamaking> gobble gobble
<mitamaking> Kenny no!!!!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02XD
<RaveBrony> Seems like a rather new thing :P
<TheKatPony> lOL
<Spademagnes[R]> What the hell is that?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<VenHur> XD
<Shizuka> 13berrypunch is a bot we're testing/developing
<NocturnalBlade> Ponies47: i got the Carolina Honey ones....OMG i love em
<oni_link> what the hell are you supposed to be anyway?
<Dken2021> good point
<oni_link> LS
<TheKatPony> Just what I was thinking
<thelonepony> run!!
<Ponies47> oni_link: You just can't put them down! D:
<oni_link> :D
<Ponies47> Spectrum_Rush: O.O
<NocturnalBlade> Spectrum_Rush: lol nice
<RaveBrony> Oh, cool :)
<Shizuka> 13primary function is to take over the spam autokicks so we don't have a bunch of client scripts disagreeing on timing and/or are more likely to lag and misfire
*Meanwhile in Africa...
<oni_link> Ponies47: I know, they might be evil O,o
<mitamaking> Meanwhile: nice
<otakon> and then he died of exposure
<Ponies47> NocturnalBlade: Original is my favorite flavor :3
<Spademagnes[R]> Time to play some Megaman Starforce 3 for a bit
<Shizuka> 13eventually we want it to take over color kicks and sync up bans across the side channels, but that's a ways off
<otakon> no more funding
<superretroworld> this is horrible
<Spectrum_Rush> Ponies47: yeah... i have a fast matabilism :$
<Shizuka> 13very slow inertia getting the development done since it's basically our only project atm
<otakon> at least he got his watch
<Spademagnes[R]> Spectrum_Rush: Pinkie pie fast?
<Dken2021> letterboxes?
<mitamaking> wide screen time
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> inb4 Braveheart scene lol
<PillowPoni> Meanwhile has the most convient nick
<otakon> dat Braveheart speech
<Ponies47> oni_link: EVIL!
<TheKatPony> lol ^^
<Shizuka> 13at least tech wise
<otakon> also, letterbox
<sub06905> dat chef
<VenHur> Dat widescreen
<Ponies47> Spectrum_Rush: O.O
<NocturnalBlade> PillowPoni: true lol
<oni_link> Ponies47: EEEEEEVVVILLLL D: hahaha
<Meanwhile> Why'd you decide to name it after the fanon town drunk?
<Spectrum_Rush> Spademagnes[R]: yeah pretty much
<otakon> Chief is best character
<mitamaking> kilt
<Shizuka> 13phase's fault :3
<RaveBrony> sounds awesome :o
<VenHur> PEOPLES OF SOUTH PARK, TONIGHT WE DINE FOR TURKEYS!
<Kandarihu> Spademagnes[R], they did the old-fashioned lottery, but they made a channel and told everypony to do it THERE. That way, it didn't take an hour.
<Ponies47> oni_link: XD
<otakon> OUR FREEEEEEEEEEDOM!
<Reikim> Phase should be given a medal for that name.
<mitamaking> I miss Chef, too bad Hayes made that stupid move
<TheKatPony> XD The turkeys!
<NocturnalBlade> *gobble gobble gobble*
<VenHur> Lol
<otakon> and then the Turkey's had the SAME SPEECH!
<Reikim> It is, in fact, perfect in a nonsensical yet intrinsic way.
<Shizuka> 13probably because if an autokick's connection lags and misfires, it tends to misfire a lot at once
<Shizuka> 13just like drunk berry punch :3
<otakon> CHARGE!
<Dovah> mitamaking: isnt Hayes ded?
<mitamaking> Dovah: yeah
<otakon> Dovah: sadly he is
<Ponies47> VenHur: XD
<otakon> and Chief is dead in the show too
<Reikim> Hey, so long as it's not hitting me, then I'm all for it.
<Reikim> Hours of amusement.
<Dovah> NOOOOOO!
<DeadpoolDash> chef
<mitamaking> But he quit South Park because of them making fun of Scientology
<otakon> but he got brought back as a Pedophile Darth Vader
<RaveBrony> Indeed
<otakon> mitamaking: bc it deserves to be made fun of
<Kimori> o.o
<Shizuka> 13one good feature i want to see if we can do is having it maintain its own ban list
<Kimori> Are you still getting that?
<superretroworld> i cant belive how insulting this show is
<otakon> hell they make fun of everthing else
<SuperBrony64> 11,02GIMME DAT CAKE
<Reikim> Also, with her now handling kicks, otakon x Berry Punch will practically become canon.
<VenHur> Dat hallahlujah.
<Spectrum_Rush> veal... roll ups?
<otakon> DAT BITCH
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<Dovah> dah phuq is scientology?
<TheKatPony> stupid fat bitch
<Shizuka> 13the eggdrop bot that's been around since like 1993 has this thing where if you ban someone it tracks it and automatically "unbans" after a certain time, to keep the actual channel bans clean
<thelonepony> Fat bitch
*Ponies47 Gives SuperBrony64 DAT CAKE
<RaveBrony> Reikim: Rofl! :D
<Shizuka> 13but if it spots the person coming back, it reapplies the ban
<NocturnalBlade> uhoh
<Spectrum_Rush> Dovah: a cult
<mitamaking> Can you show the sequel next SuperBrony64?
<superretroworld> chef wallace
<Shizuka> 13until you tell the bot to actually unban
<VenHur> NOOOO! ZE CAKE IS AH LIEZ!
<thelonepony> kill jabba the hutt
<VenHur> LIEZ I TELL YU!
<Dovah> Spectrum_Rush: very informative :|
<otakon> Dovah: a recent religion founded by a sci-fi writer. Also, it's very cult like and secretive in general.
<Meanwhile> Sounds convenient.
<NocturnalBlade> nooooo Kenny!
<Shizuka> 13since we tended to hit the ban limits in side channels and mane a whole lot during episode streams, that would be one handy feature
<otakon> KENNY NO!!!!!!!!!!!
<Spademagnes[R]> Again
<mitamaking> Kenny NOOOOOOOOOO
<thelonepony> kenny no:'(
<TheKatPony> annnddd there goes kenny
<otakon> YOU BASTARD!
<Reikim> Gonna teach BP how to do this?
<VenHur> KENNY! NOOOOOO!!!
<shibaru> YEA O.O
<Shizuka> 13hope so, probably won't happen for weeks yet
<superretroworld> you should be
<Meanwhile> Anyhoo, 5:30 in the morning seems as good a time to go to bed as any.
<Spademagnes[R]> God damn it you are so usless
<Meanwhile> Night everyone.
<otakon> Goddammit Barbrady
<Meanwhile> Night Regs.
<otakon> night Meanwhile sleep well
<Reikim> But if you've hit the ban limit, you can't really ban everyone you need to, can you?
<Ponies47> Night Meanwhile!
<PillowPoni> Night Meanwhile
<TheKatPony> goodnight Meanwhile
<Spectrum_Rush> nite Meanwhile
<Reikim> Night Meanwhile
<Celes_Chere> Marklar you Marklar
<superretroworld> night Meanwhile

<sub06905> night Meanwhile
<NocturnalBlade> Meanwhile: Trixie! lol
<RaveBrony> Cya Meanwhile
<thelonepony> Night Meanwhile
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sequel?
<Reikim> I mean, the server can only hold so many bands in place, right?
<otakon> SuperBrony64: sure
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You mean the one with Marvin again/
<Dovah> lol that mouse
<SuperBrony64> 11,02?
<otakon> dat rat
<mitamaking> SuperBrony64: starvin Marvin returns
<TheKatPony> did they kill that fat chick
<Reikim> So when you hit that number, eggdrop or no, you can't keep out everyone you want to keep out, can you?
<otakon> SuperBrony64: with Marklar
<Shizuka> 13it's something like 300 per channel i think, though we had IRCops set a mode that raises it
<otakon> A feast!
<RaveBrony> How often do you have to actually ban someone tho?
<Celes_Chere> I was just saying Marklar, because this episode reminds me of it, but the sequel would be awesome
<Spademagnes[R]> There she is
<TheKatPony> oh
<Kandarihu> According to Wikipedia, it seems that he didn't quit voluntarily, but the decision was made for him.
<Shizuka> 13too often..
<otakon> and Marvin was hailed as a hero
<Shizuka> 13especially with school starting soon, bratty teenagers keep flooding in
<otakon> Kandarihu: by the Scientologists I would guess
<Reikim> I assume it's worse during seasons.
<mitamaking> :(
<sub06905> lol
<Reikim> Bratty teens should be leaving soon.
<otakon> :'(
<Spademagnes[R]> Son of a bitch
<TheKatPony> lol
<NocturnalBlade> :D
<Shizuka> 13and ja during streams there's usually four or five bans per weekend
<VenHur> Lol
<Dovah> :D
<RaveBrony> Ah yes, forgot about the seasons...
<otakon> Goddammit
<mitamaking> god damnit
<otakon> sounds like me
<Shizuka> 13during season sorry
<TheKatPony> godammit
<Reikim> Manechat becomes a jungle during season.
<Shizuka> 13some we do timebans where our client automatically unsets after some time
<Dken2021> poor kenny's family
<Shizuka> 13i think there's a chanserv command to do timebans too
<otakon> literally
<TheKatPony> LOL
<otakon> brb need a drink
<mitamaking> otakon: HA HA HA HA HA
<mitamaking> ^Sarcasm laugh
<Shizuka> 13training is hard though so it's a bit of a good thing the season premiere is still a ways off, gives us time to prepare
<VenHur> Actually, I have a can opener...my fists... *realises he has hooves* ...OH, SON OF A-

<Reikim> Were you supposed to say that?
<RaveBrony> Im so jelly of your programming abilities. I have no cool skill like that...
<Dovah> VenHur: I think hooves would be better actually
<Kandarihu> I just realized something about PSO2 today. The music in the city is only the way it is because of a Summer event. Once August is over, it'll change to a non-event mode.
<Celes_Chere> This episode :D
<mitamaking> oh this
*Spademagnes[R] has swords for hands

<VenHur> Ohhh man, THIS EPISODE!
<Shizuka> 13simple to pick up, but most importantly has practically no toolchain, so you make a change to code and can immediately see the results in a browser (well... minus a refresh)
<Spademagnes[R]> The days of Vanilla wow
<Reikim> You could always try starting with Scratch.
<TheKatPony> XD

<Reikim> It's the best for teaching the concept of code flow, though. Moving from one statement to another, etc.
<Kencolt> My Fave episode. Yay.
<Shizuka> 13some places like to direct people to Python as a first language, but i hate hate hate their decision to make spaces and tabs part of the actual code...
<Kandarihu> Now who was complaining about animation nowadays being done by computer?
<VenHur> Lol
<cades> imma go to bed now, cya
<Reikim> What
<TheKatPony> lol this is great
<Reikim> That would throw me off so much.
<superretroworld> why are you changing it?
<otakon> Kandarihu: I wasn't I was just saying it was all paper back then
<shibaru> OKE
<RaveBrony> Needs more Horde.
*Celes_Chere is playing Horde
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol dat guy
<otakon> and yet...no Horde
<Dken2021> dem korens
<otakon> no equipment
<RaveBrony> Lol!
<TheKatPony> not kenny!
<Shizuka> 13an if block isn't something like if (something=true) { thenDoSomething() }
<Souporcat> otakon, there was some equipment
<Reikim> Anyway, RaveBrony, try Scratch if you want an easy way to understand code basics. Play with it a bit, move on.
<thelonepony> NO kenny
<TheKatPony> lol
<otakon> Helm
<Spitfire> LOOOOOOOOL
<otakon> Gloves
<Shizuka> 13it's like if (something=true):, and then a new line, and a specific indent, and then what you do
<otakon> Boots
<Reikim> Really>
<Kencolt> And yes. Kyle is hot.
<thelonepony> run fat as
<RaveBrony> Hmm
<VenHur> NOOOOO KEEEENNNY!!!
<otakon> a dagger
<Shizuka> 13and to close the block you go back to the previous indent
<Shizuka> 13i hate it so much
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<TheKatPony> XD Yep!
<NocturnalBlade> dat nerd
<otakon> and then
<RaveBrony> I guess i have to have a pupose for programming :D
<Eulshy> hehehe
<TheKatPony> Exactly!
<XylemTube> Having to agree to duels is for pussies. play EvE
<Shizuka> 13because whitespace is exactly that, whitespace, invisible, it's there for your benefit.... every other language would be perfectly happy with if(foo=bar){doSomething();} because it scans by actual characters to find the meaning
<Fangrend> how do you kill that witch has no life
<Eulshy> Mwh, he can't be on every server at once
<Shizuka> 13the programmer chooses how to (or not) indent stuff to make it human readable
<superretroworld> this isnt the whole ep is it?
<Spademagnes[R]> 60
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol my god
<Spademagnes[R]> Wasnt the cap 60 at this time?
<Spitfire> lool
<Kencolt> Eulshy: He's multiboxing.
<Dken2021> not those kid's characters! so young!
<TheKatPony> THEY JUST STARTED PLAYING!
<NocturnalBlade> Spademagnes[R]: i think so
<Dovah> Send in the Expendables!!!
<Eulshy> it was either 60 or 65 at this time
<Kimori> bye
<Spademagnes[R]> Which is like me!
<TheKatPony> XD
<TheKatPony> Like me!
<Spademagnes[R]> I have no life!
<Reikim> Granted, some are better than others at that last bit.
<Celes_Chere> Eulshy: Would've been 60, 65 was never the cap
<Kimori> whos going to work?
<VenHur> That player must of reached LVL 9001 at that time...Hm...
<XylemTube> r-tard
<RaveBrony> Huh, ill look up fun stuff to do, and see if i can learn that stuff :D
<Dovah> Use alucard who is known as "The No-life King"
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<Celes_Chere> 60>70>80>85
<Spademagnes[R]> Wait hunter?
<otakon> party of Nightelves
<Reikim> Try Scratch.
<Kandarihu> How many hours would it take someone to reach Lvl 60?
<thelonepony> i'm lonely and i have no life
<Celes_Chere> ded
<Reikim> It takes code and turns it into manipulatives, thus why it works.
<otakon> Kandarihu: about 100
<RaveBrony> Lol!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<VenHur> Lol
<Reikim> As a teaching tool, anyway.
<TheKatPony> lol
<Spademagnes[R]> Did they actualy get a special server to use from Blizzard or something?
<TheKatPony> brilliant
<otakon> and gipped
<Ponies47> Back. Sorry computer was glitching up :/
<CECtheRonin> LOL
<Spitfire> why
<Spitfire> WHY
<Shizuka> 13is scratch the MIT thing or the google thing?
<RaveBrony> Ill look it up :P
<Eulshy> I assume beta use
<Reikim> I hate Scratch because it has no OOP ability.
<Reikim> It's the MIT thing.
<Buytoast> i beleive they ahd special software
<Shizuka> 13google did a puzzle sort of programming thing recently... was... interesting
<Buytoast> for this certain episode
<Spademagnes[R]> I forgot that WoW had a pre Wrath map
<Spademagnes[R]> I am so used to the recent map
<superretroworld> just like psn
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<VenHur> ...Y'know I played Warcraft too, but not as often, right?
<Shizuka> 13let me see if i can find it
<Reikim> Personally, I started out with Game Maker. It had a built-in language a bit like C, only less difficult.
<VenHur> I rather played TF2.
<Kencolt> Gentlecolts... we are seeing the birth of a raid.
<Spademagnes[R]> I leveled from 60 to 80 in less than a month
<RaveBrony> Lol! :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol dat song
<Spademagnes[R]> I have no life
<TheKatPony> I don't have a life either
<Reikim> Probably not the best place to start, but it introduced me to the concept of objects and instances quickly.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol butters
<RaveBrony> Aww snap!!
<Spademagnes[R]> God damn it Butters
<superretroworld> Spademagnes[R]: you watch mlp, so you pretty much have a life
<otakon> Goddammit Butters
<thelonepony> kill butters
<Reikim> So when I tried Scratch I immediately loathed it due to the inability to create instances.
<thelonepony> now!
<Kandarihu> Whatever. Butters will be lvl 1
<Spademagnes[R]> Remember when Westfall belonged to the Alliance?
<otakon> dat raid
<Kencolt> Honestly... Butters ROCKS here.
<Shizuka> 13here we go http://blockly-demo.appspot.com/blockly/demos/maze/index.html
<BerryPunch> Title on blockly-demo.appspot.com: Blockly Demo: Maze
<otakon> most of them are level 1
<VenHur> Damnit Butters, that means you don't watch Ponies either! GODDAMNIT!
<Eulshy> I don't see any druids
<Spitfire> lol butters
<thelonepony> timmaY
<TheKatPony> oh god XD
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<otakon> Timmy is a Druid
<Eulshy> Still see no druids
<Reikim> Oh hey
<otakon> Goddammit BUtters
<Reikim> That's Scratch.
<Eulshy> Timmy is?
<Shizuka> 13that was fun seeing that posted to reddit, cause the threads eventually devolved into code golf, where you try to solve the problem in as few things as possible
<Reikim> Or it's based off of it.
<VenHur> Lol
<Buytoast> Timmy's a priest.
<XylemTube> is that an actual game?
<Celes_Chere> Are any of them healers? o_O
<Eulshy> pick a horde race
<superretroworld> XD
<Reikim> The code block given is from Scratch.
<Shizuka> 13i think there was a one-line solution eventually, no ifs at all
<RaveBrony> dat Arathi Highlands
<thelonepony> ded
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<VenHur> Yeah, it's called World of Warcraft.
<Kandarihu> XylemTube, yes. But it seems they're taking a lot of creative liberties for the sake of the story.
<Eulshy> None of them look like druids
<TheKatPony> lol
<Shizuka> 13"Blockly is one of a growing number of visual programming environments. Many of these languages have roots at MIT, leading to a similar look and feel across different products. Blockly was influenced by App Inventor, which in turn was influenced by Scratch, which in turn was influenced by StarLogo."
<Spademagnes[R]> Wait what
<Spademagnes[R]> If only if that happened in the game
<thelonepony> dat face
<otakon> yes he is hax
<Spademagnes[R]> Where the hell are the healers
<superretroworld> is this us?
<thelonepony> Medic!
<Kencolt> Of course, these days I play a worgen femme in a mailkini. But.. yes it's a game.
<Spademagnes[R]> God klyde
<Celes_Chere> They have one healer -_(\
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<otakon> goddammit Clyde
<RaveBrony> Lol!
<TheKatPony> XD
<Eulshy> None of them are druids
<VenHur> Lol
<NocturnalBlade> lol Clyde
<thelonepony> Playboy XD
<Eulshy> I looked
<otakon> Eulshy: this was before Druids were good
<TheKatPony> failure
<NocturnalBlade> RAGE!
<Kandarihu> He's like a Tonberry
<Eulshy> otakon, druids are always good
<Spademagnes[R]> What
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol Kandarihu
<Spitfire> WHAT 5000?!
<Eulshy> then again back then most of them were trolls and Tauran
<Dken2021> no, our characters are adead!
<Buytoast> over 5,000 in the arathi highlands
<otakon> damn
<pony_4050> I hated the Highlands
<Buytoast> it's so ridiculous
<RaveBrony> Needs more FROST SHOOCK!
<Spademagnes[R]> Ban the douche!
<Celes_Chere> ...wouldn't 5000 players in arathi Highlands crash the server?
<otakon> he managed to kill 5000 characters?
<otakon> DUN DUN DUN!
<Spademagnes[R]> Just what is the cap pop for a realm?
<otakon> no idea
<Celes_Chere> The bodies alone would make for unbearable lag
<Kencolt> Not asmn good as a hunter-- if propery played.
<otakon> and then this plan
<Ponies47> NO! NOOOOOOO!
<Eulshy> 60 Shamans VS 60 Paladins in the Arathi Highlands, bye bye server
<Reikim> They're good for teaching concepts.
<otakon> goddamn griefer
<Spademagnes[R]> Isnt the Sword of a Thousand truths in the actual game?
<Reikim> Gives you a concrete idea os what the code looks like.
<Dken2021> yea iirc
<TheKatPony> dayum
<otakon> Spademagnes[R]: yes but under another name, same sprite though
<Reikim> From there you just abstractualize more to get written code.
<Buytoast> yeah, it drops from 80 naxx
<NocturnalBlade> chat derped:P
<pony_4050> 65 Million
<pony_4050> Hahaha
<Kencolt> And Cartman redefins GRIND.
<Buytoast> Slayer of the Lifeless
<Spademagnes[R]> Forget the fact you cant get exp from grey levels
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<XylemTube> XD
<Spademagnes[R]> So this makes no sense
<otakon> Spademagnes[R]: not the POINT in this case
<NocturnalBlade> oh man dis song
<Dark_Horst> MONTAGE!
<otakon> poor boars
<XylemTube> lolhuntsman
<Eulshy> I wish boars were worth 2 exp, i would just kill boars
<Dken2021> ohai Pauls Stanley
<otakon> but this IS a goddamn satire of it
<superretroworld> this episode actually has great dialogue
<VenHur> Spademagnes[R]: Well, this episode is one of the best in South Park's run, so Blizzard decided to add it in the actual game.
<Spademagnes[R]> Am I lame if I grinded from 60 to 80 in less than a month?
<otakon> Spademagnes[R]: not really
<pony_4050> Eugh
<Eulshy> Live to win
<Celes_Chere> Spademagnes[R]: nah
<otakon> so much monster
<pony_4050> Ewh
<Eulshy> till ya die
<RaveBrony> O.o
<TheKatPony> LOL
<Reikim> Why the look?
<TheKatPony> oh god
<otakon> a hope?
<otakon> a chance
<Shizuka> 13abstractualize
<Ponies47> Oh God how they look! :O
<otakon> KEEP CLICKING
<VenHur> Spademagnes[R]: Nah, you'll be fine.
<Celes_Chere> exp: 142
<Spademagnes[R]> wait that said 142
<Reikim> I'm not sure that's a word.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oh god 0_o
<RaveBrony> all the fat and zits!!
<pony_4050> They look so disgusting
<Shizuka> 13it's like... a hair's breadth from corpspeak..
<VenHur> OH GOD!
<Reikim> I made it up on the spot because.
<shibaru> huh?
<TheKatPony> they are fucking huge
<Kencolt> Spademagnes[R]: We're a ack of loons who are facinated with candy colored PONIES-- we should now start to worry about the realities of WoW? LET THEM GRIND BOARS.
<Shizuka> 13and corpspeak scares me a lot...
<TheKatPony> LOL
<Reikim> Corpspeak?
<otakon> dat fist pump
<Celes_Chere> Kencolt: Well said
<VenHur> OH GOD, THE HUMANITY!
<superretroworld> LMFAO XD
<NocturnalBlade> Kencolt: true
<Spademagnes[R]> is Dwarf needs food a reference?
<Shizuka> 13yes clearly you haven't synergized your forward moving interfaces
<RaveBrony> Im looking up coding stuffs, it is all alien speak to me :D
<Shizuka> 13god it hurts ><
<TheKatPony> Maybe
<Reikim> Hey
<Reikim> Hey
<superretroworld> cartmans speech FTW
<Celes_Chere> Spademagnes[R]: Gauntlet, maybe?
<otakon> Kencolt: the true beauty of this episode is the double parody
<Reikim> I was nowhere near there.
<Buytoast> that's more from Gauntlet
<Shizuka> 13:3
<Reikim> I would be ashamed to be there
<otakon> Long ago=3 months
<Shizuka> 13okay good, you can have a cookie~
<Spademagnes[R]> If only mana burn existed
<XylemTube> yes let's leave t overpowered wepon in the game's code. Seems legit
<Celes_Chere> http://www.wowhead.com/item=39344/slayer-of-the-lifeless
<otakon> 120 dps, +80 Stamina
<Reikim> "Synergy" is a word I stay away from unless I need it to describe something specific.
<Celes_Chere> fpor the curious
*Reikim noms cookie
<Celes_Chere> *for
<Dken2021> heheh, dat name
<Reikim> Or if I'm trying to sound like corpspeak.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<Kencolt> IT TWINKLED.
<VenHur> And then Blizzard seen this episode and said. "Screw it, we're putting it back in the game."
<Spademagnes[R]> and they do
<Reikim> "Synergize" is just one of those words.
<TheKatPony> XD
<Shizuka> 13there are only three cases where i will say "synergy"... 1) i am talking about the HL2 coop mod... 2) i am taking about the keyboard/mouse sharing program... or 3) i am making fun of corpspeak
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> too late
<otakon> VenHur: eeyup
<Reikim> It's good in sci-fi, though.
<RaveBrony> Sounds like "Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker"?? :o
<Eulshy> Dat flash drive
<otakon> THE FINAL BATTLE!
<pony_4050> So... disgusting
<Kimori> nvm
<Eulshy> One of them should be a druid
<Spademagnes[R]> May I ask any other Wow players, what started the whole Thunder fury chat spam?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol oh god
<Spectrum_Rush> VenHur: Blizzed work in conjuction with the creaters of south park on this episode
<shibaru> Goodnigy I'm feelon finky, my eues are dero, and I have work tomorroqw.
<TheKatPony> moar hotpockets!
<otakon> 12 real life hours
<otakon> jesus
<NocturnalBlade> i am so glad i'm not like that XD
<Reikim> I'd claim, in certain cases, that a game might have a good synergy between its gameplay and story, but I prefer to use another word I can't think of right now.
<Buytoast> Thunderfury has a long name
<Dken2021> mmm, chips-a-ho
<Buytoast> so it;'s good to spam
<Kencolt> It's CARTMAN. He can ONLY be disgusting. that's his JOB.
<otakon> reminds me of goddamn one boss fight from FFXII
<VenHur> Same that I'm not like them.
<superretroworld> i love video game mysteries
<Spademagnes[R]> What boss fight otakon?
<pony_4050> I lost 13 kilogram in the last 13 weeks. Man, feels good to not be overweigh anymore
<Kandarihu> They did nothing but grind on low level monsters. They shouldn't have anything that doesn't drop from them.
<Eulshy> Hotpocket. 1.Unwrap, 2. Microwave, 3.Immediatly drop in toilet
<Shizuka> 13but i had a group project once where we had to do like a whole corporate project kind of thing, requests for information and executive summaries and whatnot... and i'm terrible at filling what should have been paragraphs of info.. i'm too simple and specific for that
<TheKatPony> No kidding ^^
<Spademagnes[R]> Arent hotpockets like nuclear bombs?
<otakon> Spademagnes[R]: it was a secret boss with 1.3 MILLION hp
<Shizuka> 13but this guy in my group... he could babble corpspeak all day long...
<Celes_Chere> Arcane fire mage...
<Spectrum_Rush> Eulshy: dat jim gaffigan joke
<XylemTube> Why dose Giving some kids a Dev weapon seem like a REALLY bad idea?
<Spademagnes[R]> Either too hot or too cold
<Spademagnes[R]> otakon: is it yizamat?
<Reikim> There's one in every crowd.
<otakon> Spademagnes[R]: most damage you could do is 9999 and you couldn't do that consistently
<otakon> Spademagnes[R]: yeah Yizamat...fuck that jackass
<otakon> goddamn 17 hours?
<Reikim> Sometimes they're for real. Sometimes they're just guys like me who can babble in anything and get away with it.
<Kencolt> What arcane mage even BOTHERS with fire? I mrean, really... I play too much W0W , don't I?
<NocturnalBlade> otakon: oh i remember that...he was also in Super mario RPG lol
<Reikim> Another horrible indicator of the corpspeak mentality: flowcharts.
<Shizuka> 13tended to just have him fill out paragraphs and i did the rest of the work building a style guide and making the project not look like everyone else's, which was barely high school grade work in a college course
<Dken2021> otakon no limit breaks?
<Eulshy> Why not just make uber armor and weapon to kill the ultimate player with?
<otakon> NocturnalBlade: wait...Yizamat was in SMRPG?
<TheKatPony> oh my gawd..
<Reikim> Did you have a flowchart?
<pony_4050> AWH MA GAWD
<Spademagnes[R]> 50,112,254 is how much Yizamat had
<NocturnalBlade> otakon: i think so...he was a secret boss
<otakon> hand cramp
<Shizuka> 13don't think so, at least not in the "if this then do that" way
<otakon> NocturnalBlade: no no that was the other guy
<Spademagnes[R]> In the orgional version you could take breaks from the fight
<Buytoast> i do like this molten core music
<XylemTube> carpel tunnel
<Eulshy> WE NEED BENGAY
<otakon> dat shuffling
<Shizuka> 13used it to represent a network though
<Spitfire> otakon: carpel tunnel
<Reikim> Flowcharts are another one
<Spademagnes[R]> In the international version they changed that
<NocturnalBlade> otakon: other guy?
<Spademagnes[R]> Fuck you Stan's mom!
<otakon> NocturnalBlade: not Yizamat.. he was from FFIV
<Sumica> 00,10the wow one again?
*Spademagnes[R] flips a table!
<Reikim> If money is featured anywhere on a flowchart, be afraid.
<otakon> Sumica: again? yes.
<Reikim> Be very afraid.
<otakon> No, I have a life.
<Shizuka> 13i appear to have destroyed every record of that project from all of my archives... can't imagine why past shizu would want to get away from it :3
<Kandarihu> Gee, they have access to the servers, even physically.
<TheKatPony> this is amazing XD
<VenHur> Sumica: Well, it's so good, it's story must repeated...twice.
<Kencolt> And he... kneels.
<NocturnalBlade> otakon: ahhh ok yea wrong guy XD
<Reikim> Shame, I could have had a night lambasting it.
<otakon> Kencolt: I love this episode
<thelonepony> ah!!!!
<XylemTube> GTA
<Spitfire> 1 star wanted level
<Shizuka> 13the instructor was tenured, and it really really showed...
<Spademagnes[R]> Cairne is a boring Ream
<Celes_Chere> what classes are they playng?
<Spademagnes[R]> *realm
<otakon> NELSON!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol oh god 0_o *puke*

<Spademagnes[R]> My guild is the only one thing that keeps me there
<XylemTube> oh god this
<Kencolt> otakon: Mee too. IF only because I have one of the hottest worgen alive.... well, virtual alive.
<Spademagnes[R]> Ew
<RaveBrony> o_o

<CECtheRonin> Dear God.
<Spademagnes[R]> Buffer!
<Kandarihu> Buffer
<Shizuka> 13for both classes i had with him, he said you should totally expect to just go googling and copy, entirely, stuff you find to put on the projects
<thelonepony> noooooo!!
<Kandarihu> Done
<VenHur> THE HUMANITY!
<otakon> our demo
<Spademagnes[R]> Poor kid
<Eulshy> WoW got boring

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<otakon> Spademagnes[R]: enope
<Celes_Chere> http://www.wowhead.com/item=39344/slayer-of-the-lifeless
<Reikim> The quality of education these days...
<Eulshy> Heeeey
<Shizuka> 13ikr...
<Eulshy> He skipped it
<otakon> or just 'I'
<Dken2021> not randy!
<Ponies47> Ewwwwwwww
<TheKatPony> NOOO
<otakon> stan!
<Spademagnes[R]> PREPARE TO DIE
<Shizuka> 13my networking instructor was amazing awesome though, learned so much
<NocturnalBlade> prepare to die
<Kencolt> otakon: I have this thing for wolves. I also have this thing for women. I have a wolf-woman in a mailkini. DEAL.
<Celes_Chere> Hunter has no pet...
<NocturnalBlade> Finish HIM
<Spademagnes[R]> FINISH HIM
<Shizuka> 13and he was an xkcd reader and tended to keep an eye on woot.com auctions during downtime :3
<XylemTube> lol he ded
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> FATALITY
<otakon> Kencolt: what about the White Wolf Bitch? "WUAIIII!"
<TheKatPony> LOL
<thelonepony> pwon!
<Reikim> One of the best teachers I've ever heard about.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<Spitfire> raaaaah
<Kencolt> otakon: DIFFERENT WOLF.
<CECtheRonin> All this kinda makes me want to play TOR.
<otakon> Kencolt: you don't know who I'm talking about do you?
<Dken2021> alright!
<Spademagnes[R]> SO MANY NOOBS
<Celes_Chere> Kencolt: I've got a belf in bondage gear...I've dealt
<otakon> and HERE is the kicker
<Kandarihu> "My name is Lovesto*******. You PK'd my father. Prepare to die... for once."
<superretroworld> did that sig say minecraft?
<Reikim> My award for most awesome teacher, though, has to go to an art prof I once heard about.
<Spademagnes[R]> Molten core?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<Reikim> Art history.
<superretroworld> sign*
<Reikim> Fond of slideshows.
<Shizuka> 13mmm art history
<otakon> AND THEY DO THE SAME EXACT THING
<Reikim> Except he'd insert strange things at times.
<TheKatPony> And with that, I gotta go to sleep. Night everyone
<Dken2021> goodnight TheKatPony
<Dovah> night TheKatPony

<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: this was before... or atleast aired before
<Ponies47> Nothing much Wrek
<XylemTube> Hi Wrek
<Spademagnes[R]> Diamond Tiara is worst pony
<Derpy_Hooves> i like silverspoon
<Celes_Chere> I like to think of it as they are just selling to make ends meet, not make a profit
<Dken2021> Wrek not gonna belive it, but.... stuff
<otakon> ^
<Sumica> 00,10oh darn, i have always wanted to kick yaplap.......in the nuts

<RaveBrony> Sumica: Not until i do first! :D
<otakon> Celes_Chere: but seriously, we've SEEN the business they make. They are the ONLY farm in Ponyville of any notable size.
<Reikim> But if you're throwing a pokeball, why bother poking? That's like...twice the poking.
<Sumica> 00,10cause he is anoying
<Shizuka> 13wreeeeeek you are supposed to be sleeeeep
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: I think it's because people say that Rainbow Dash doens't need this epidoe considering that she's always been a narcissist.
<JESmith71> Granny with false teeth is creepy
<Shizuka> 13yes
<Spademagnes[R]> Bee beard
<pony_4050> "Hi, I'm Granny Smith - Welcome to Jackass!!!!!!"

<Eulshy> Saliva, safe to be swapped

<Spademagnes[R]> FUCK OFF TIARA
<otakon> Wrek: try lying down
<Reikim> So what shall you nickname your newest capture?
<Kencolt> otakon: The point isn't so much that I can play a giant wolf-wonam in a bikini. Not so much that I can... but... well... I CAN. It's insane. It's outrageous. It's totally SILLY... and I can DO IT.
<Eulshy> SuperBrony64, King of the Hill..
<Spademagnes[R]> Does anyone even like Diamond?
<Ponies47> Bee's!
<Celes_Chere> Derpy_Hooves: agreed
<otakon> Kencolt: yay for you :P

<SuperBrony64> 11,02But...but...why ;~;
<Unnr> Hee, Maury in Equestria
<NocturnalBlade> i dont thinks Silver Spoon would be bad if she did hang with D.T.
<Celes_Chere> Silver Spoon needs some fan love
<Kencolt> otakon: BECAUSE I CAN DO THAT.
<Spademagnes[R]> Granny is pretty swift for a old gal
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, would you be bothered to see her getting spanked for most of the things she does in this whole series?
<otakon> Kencolt: I said yay for you :P
<Eulshy> Spadesmagnes[R] I like Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon
<Spademagnes[R]> Eulshy: Get out

<Spademagnes[R]> No one should ever like those two assholes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay Cheerilee.
<Kencolt> otakon: Yes. Yay for me. O deserve a yay or two.
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: I still like the episode. I can see Twilight and her friends explain to RD not to obsess over her fame, RD agreeing not to, and the next scene RD completely obsessing over it. That's why I like the episode.
<NocturnalBlade> dat Nittany_Discord
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Eulshy: Okie ;~;

<Spademagnes[R]> So what the fuck is a tiara and a spoon supposed to get you?

<Spademagnes[R]> Nothing
<Wrek> to the ARTBOARD!
<otakon> Kencolt: we get it! ya horn dog
<Dken2021> crows in a form of a heart, so omnious!
<Shizuka> 13X3
<Kandarihu> Spademagnes[R], cutie marks represent what they're good at, and they go into a vocation based on that.
<Eulshy> Hey, I like Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon
<Derpy_Hooves> Wrek: i like silverspoon, because i think she would be very nice if she wasn't friends with tiara. thats my head canon
<otakon> Wrek: oh god at least make them older
<Dark_Horst> she's probabaly a spooner
<otakon> ...
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: of course, but one thing i dont like about rd is that shes too famous to be part of the mane 6
<Celes_Chere> Spademagnes[R]: Silversmithing, maybe?
<Spademagnes[R]> Diamond and Silver will never make a living
<Sumica> 00,10Cant sleep wrek?
<Spademagnes[R]> They will die alone and unloved
<otakon> shamed
<otakon> motified
<otakon> Two dictionaries and a chicken
<NocturnalBlade> I could like Silver, if she didnt hang with Tiara
<Derpy_Hooves> Spademagnes[R]: but i like silverspoon :<

<Kandarihu> Well, Filthy Rich has bags of gold for his cutie mark. DT's talent is clear: to follow in her daddy's footsteps.
<otakon> SOLDIER SMITH!
<Celes_Chere> This episode shows a glimmer of hope for Silver Spoon
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: That's when Mare Do Well comes in and takes her fame, which is a great counter to her popularity.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> SB knows parsel ?
<Reikim> SuperBrony64: The Moo Pokemon
<Ponies47> Dat TF2 ref! XD
<RaveBrony> Nittany_Discord: Why is that?
<Eulshy> IF WAR LEADS TO VICTORY THAN YOU MUST WIN
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay Wrek. Insomnia buddies.
<Spademagnes[R]> The whole Mare do well bit seems like a jerk move in twilight's part
<otakon> Eulshy:no you must fight
<Reikim> This 'mon is well known for its tendency to bleat like certain herbivorous mammals.
<otakon> dat Sweetie plottin face

<Spademagnes[R]> Some friends...
<RaveBrony> What level that SB? :o
<Wrek> as for silver spoon not being as much of a bitch as diamond tiara. i can see that. without her she'd probably be more friendly
<Wrek> then again
<Dark_Horst> INVASION
<Reikim> It is known to have an affinity for certain electronics, and a somewhat ambiguous relationship with ponies.

<Spademagnes[R]> Yea it does Scootaloo
<Spectrum_Rush> actually it does
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: As an optional scene, I can see Twilight and her friends explain to RD not to obsess over her fame, RD agreeing not to, and the next scene RD completely obsessing over it.
<thelonepony> danger, danger high voltage
<otakon> is it me or do the CMC look cuter than usual?

<Spademagnes[R]> FUCK YOU TIARA
<Dken2021> so the apples are part southern, part german
<Dark_Horst> uncle applestrudel does not sound like you'd expect
<Wrek> otakon: <3
<Colt_Magnum> Redo AALLLL the fanfics!
<Spademagnes[R]> Seriously how fucking old is she?
<otakon> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She can talk perfectly well with a piece of paper in her mouth. Neat!
<AJIsAwesome> I can see why people don't like the Mare Do Well episode considering that her friends don't tell her how they feel, but she also wouldn't have learned a lesson of the corrupting power of fame, either.
<Colt_Magnum> Spademagnes[R]: She predates ponyvile
<otakon> actually young GS is really cute
<Rex_Mundi> What kind of Spike applebloom picture is this
<Ponies47> I guess otakon wants somee of AB and Spike Wrek XD
<SB> 11,02Weird to name a young filly, Smith...
<otakon> NO I DO NOT
<Ponies47> *Some
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Granny is a Highlander
<Spademagnes[R]> So why did Celestia give these ponies a place that is near a gate to hell?
<Colt_Magnum> SB: wierd to name a young filly, Granny
<Kandarihu> Distance between Ponyville and Canterlot, and the Everfree Forest is southeast?
<XylemTube> Princess Trollestia Dosn't Age :D
<Dken2021> have you learned nothing of granny smith apples?
<Kencolt> Spademagnes[R]: Not QUITE as old as Celestia. But I suspect she gets CLOSE.
<Colt_Magnum> Spademagnes[R]: shush and watch the episode >:T
<Colt_Magnum> PS: Look at the tent!
<Spectrum_Rush> otakon: likes apple flambae eh :s
<RaveBrony> Dat banjo cm :D
<Spademagnes[R]> It bothers me that they gave them a land near a hellgate
<SB> 11,02I'm giving the benefit of the doubt of her parents naming her 'GRANNY SMITH' :)
<Dark_Horst> she jealous
<Ryunosuke> someones sleeping ont he couch tonight
<thelonepony> somepony is jelly
<otakon> SB: she's named after an apple type
<Wrek> sorry otakon , i forgot how easely the crowd is amipulated to harass you. it was not my intention x3
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> wasnt that mare similar to Cherry Jubille? i kinda see it
<otakon> they ARE the apple family
<Dark_Horst> Spademagnes[R]: tartarus isnt hell, that's the hades
<otakon> Wrek: yeah :P
<Spademagnes[R]> close enough
<SB> 11,02But honestly, Granny Smith was a good looking mare back in the day.
<Dark_Horst> Spademagnes[R]: tartarus is a dungeon where they locked the titans
<otakon> wait what would Timber WOlves eat?
<Spectrum_Rush> otakon: actually this is the smith family
<otakon> no
<VenHur> And then she disapered with the zomponys, the end!
<otakon> she's Granny Smith Apple
<otakon> Applejack Apple
<Kandarihu> I really don't like it when characters are named according to their role in the series as of present time without any regard for continuity.
<Ponies47> Wrek you made me be mean to otakon :<
<otakon> Big MacIntosh Apple
<Spademagnes[R]> Get a torch
<Kencolt> Spademagnes[R]: She never expectd it to eve open. But then a pony named Twilight, who is an impossible pont, was born... and ponyfeathers started to happen.
<Ponies47> I'm sorry otakon :<
<otakon> no worries
<Phase4> 00,02o_O
<otakon> hiya Phase4
<SB> 11,02Everypony, listen up!
<Phase4> 00,02pony episode? on bronystate?
<Dark_Horst> they would make for formidable fallout enemies
<Spademagnes[R]> What I want to know is what got Cerberus to leave his post
<Ponies47> Ohai Phase4
<otakon> Phase4: i know the insanity
<Ponies47> Phase4: Yeah!
<Dken2021> no Phase4, you're just imagining things
<Spectrum_Rush> they dont have last names, just cause they're called the apple family doesnt mean thats their last name
<AJIsAwesome> Also, considering the fact that RD would accumulate so much fame that ponies would constantly annoy her with it, Mare Do Well is a great counter to RD's fame. She easily snagged RD's fame and proved to her that fame isn't forever, which is a GREAT lesson to learn. That's why I love the Mare Do Well episode.
<Dark_Horst> Spademagnes[R]: walkies?
<SB> 11,02Give Derpy_Hooves a big birthday hug for it being his birthday :3
<Phase4> 00,02: D

<Colt_Magnum> "Magic is as magic does" <---CANON magic description! What now Twilight Sparkle?!
<Spademagnes[R]> I still dont get how they are so poor
<Phase4> 00,02JESmith71, ikr
<XylemTube> And so ponyville's economy was based almost completely on apples
<Dovah> Granny's are for Pwning noobs!
<Spademagnes[R]> They should be freaking rich by now
<otakon> Great Grandfather

<Spademagnes[R]> EAT it tiara
<Dark_Horst> bitch got TOLD
<Malk> otakon seems legit
<NocturnalBlade> oh snap Tiara
<otakon> Spademagnes[R]: bc everything is constantly breaking..or lots of debt from developing the farm on credit?
<AJIsAwesome> Are we seriously questioning a tv show?:S
<Dken2021> Ryunosuke no silly that's how pinkie got her cutiemark
<Colt_Magnum> Spademagnes[R]: Their entire economy is dependent on apples....Think about it. Thats the ONLY thing thats keeping their town afloat
<Dark_Horst> *squelch*
<otakon> Malk: no it's a guess, but Great Grandfather is 3 generations
<thelonepony> well better hit the hay. good night everypony
<sub06905> granny smith loves the taste of chalk
<Rex_Mundi> Well... horses love apples
<Spademagnes[R]> Colt_Magnum: so how are they so poor?

*Spectrum_Rush Princess Celestia gave Grannys parent s that land that would become ponyville this makes Granny Smith the Feudal Lord of Ponyville
<DeadpoolDash> The apple season doesnt last all year
<Dken2021> Colt_Magnum *psst* it's a cartoon
<SB> 11,02*Zap apples may cause genetic defects in offspring of pregnant mares.
<Dken2021> nighty thelonepony
<Rex_Mundi> How many apple crops do they get each year?
<Kandarihu> Spademagnes[R], Sweet Apple Acres was the foundation of Ponyville's economy as of it's inception, but times change.
<AJIsAwesome> I guess this is RD got her mane color.
<sub06905> SB: :D
<Spademagnes[R]> SB: Is that a reference?
<otakon> DeadpoolDash: no it doesn't but they wouldn't do something in the winter months?

<VenHur> KARMA! Hahaha!
<Colt_Magnum> Spademagnes[R]: Hmm...I think its overspecialization on their part. They only sell apples, and when nobody wants that much apples, they go under
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek isn't naked anymore!
<Rex_Mundi> Wrek draws pretty ponies
<Spademagnes[R]> At least Silver is nice some of the time
<sub06905> KoTH tiem?

<Colt_Magnum> Wrek: oh is this about our oil pipeline thing?

<MakerDusk> Sumica: they already tried and won
<Colt_Magnum> CECtheRonin: its scary...We're grown ups now.
<Sumica> 00,10what cracks me up about that pipeline.
<MakerDusk> we sell to the states far under the oil's value and then have to buy it back marked up from market prices
<Kandarihu> MakerDusk, we weren't there for the oil. We really DID think Iraq was making WMDs
<CECtheRonin> Colt_Magnum I know, right?
<Sumica> 00,10is the towns near it are having labor shortages
<Ryunosuke> are the cracks?
<SB> 11,02Going to restart computer, sorry, FMLE just won't end the process :<

<CECtheRonin> Hey, are there any Spider-Man afficionados in here?
<Colt_Magnum> Sumica: Well in Canada, nothing gets done if you dont got the moral highground, labor be damned
<SB> 11,02I did that Shizuka, doesn't wanna work...
<Shizuka> 13:<
<MakerDusk> Kandarihu: I am, no physicists there
<Sumica> 00,10so right now people are being offered 20/h to work fastfood joints
<MakerDusk> when physicists appear in such countries, they are rapidly assasinated
<MakerDusk> if there's no one to build it, it doesn't get built
<Colt_Magnum> Sumica: wait, r u canadian too?
<Sumica> 00,10no
<MakerDusk> Sumica: but everthing there is accordingly expensive
<Colt_Magnum> Sumica: not that theres anything wrong with that
<Kandarihu> MakerDusk, well it turns out Saddam Hussein was still in the stage of "raise funds through exploiting the UN's Oil for Food program"
<Sumica> 00,10it's happening even in northen US states too Colt_Magnum
<Colt_Magnum> Sumica: what is? 20/h for fastfood places?
<MakerDusk> Kandarihu: no, he was there at one point in the past, that's where the images were pulled from
<Colt_Magnum> Sumica: im not connecting that dots here
<MakerDusk> then the scientists were killed off
<DeadpoolDash> lolz at collecting bunny food in GW2 for the bunnies of the Hare Spirit
<MakerDusk> read your actual history and not the propoganda
<Colt_Magnum> DeadpoolDash: oooh u can make a bunnyfire!
<Sumica> 00,10people quit working the jobs such as fast food worker to go work on the pipline
<Shizuka> 13oh lol today's xkcd
<Colt_Magnum> MakerDusk: History can be very shady..Take the war of 1812 for example, both sides claim victory
<Shizuka> 13(totally not a ploy to redirect the conversation)
<Kandarihu> He was trying to make it look like he really had nukes in order to dissuade Iran from invading.
<MakerDusk> Shizuka: you spoil, I slash kill
<MakerDusk> :p
<Shizuka> 13just refresh you silly filly
<Sumica> 00,10so now inorder to keep workers they are paying them upwards of 20 an hour to keep being a fastfood worker
<Shizuka> 13until it shows up~
<DeadpoolDash> oil work pays good money, especially up here in Alaska
<Shizuka> 13anyway sleep time finally
<Eulshy> I want to move to canada
<Shizuschlafen> 13nacht ponies
<MakerDusk> Colt_Magnum: and the white house burned, burned, burned... and we're the ones that did it ^_^

<Kandarihu> Funny thing is, my pastor got married this past Saturday.
<Colt_Magnum> lol xkcd, i dont visit that site enough. good comics, lots of math though
<MakerDusk> Colt_Magnum: also, both sides did win
<MakerDusk> the canadians returned to what would become canada
<MakerDusk> so the americans turned them back
<Colt_Magnum> and the americans got their jimmies rustled
<MakerDusk> and canada was left alone
<Ponies47> back
<Colt_Magnum> and got pissed off enough to claim america
<Ponies47> and my chat is derping -_-
<MakerDusk> which is what the canadians set out to achieve
<Kandarihu> Hmm, I refreshed, but there's no stream
<Ponies47> Confound these chat derps
<Sumica> 00,10there is no stream because suppers system derped
<Colt_Magnum> MakerDusk: so really, it was some sort of fight club
<Colt_Magnum> MakerDusk: nvm that doesnt make sense
<MakerDusk> Colt_Magnum: pretty much
<Wrek> 05Ponies47: i suggest tryign a 3rd party irc client
<Wrek> 05might solve any derps
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, lol, just showed up to ask
<MakerDusk> both sides obtained what the people viewed as a victory
<Ponies47> Wrek: I'm just guessing it's my computer. Besides it's replaced in about a week
<Sumica> 00,10so give him a few and he should be back
<Colt_Magnum> MakerDusk: i guess when one side said they "won" we automatically assume the other side mustve had to lose
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: http://derpiboo.ru/56414
<Kandarihu> http://bash.org/?953079 If this gets accepted, this will be where we'll see that incident of how I pointlessly woke Sumica up on Saturday morning.

<Eulshy> I've only beat it once on the actual machine
<MakerDusk> bleh @ 20h days
<Canadian_Brony> Wrek then be careful if you watch movie. "Inspired by the board game" is a lie. Aliens, destroyers, and a Battleship from WWII that shouldn't even work because it's a museum. Strategy is mostly thrown out the window.
<Canadian_Brony> I could go on forever
<Kandarihu> Aw yeah. Simpsons Arcade game. I remember seeing that game in the arcades... back when the malls in the city I lived in had arcades.
<Buytoast> oh wow, the simpson's arcade game?

<tSparx> And SB's streaming, yay!
<Buytoast> except that scott pilgrim is a steaming pile of shit
<Canadian_Brony> movie or game?
<tSparx> Buytoast: Whoa there, sir, I respectfully disagree.
<Canadian_Brony> Game is good, movie's a guilty pleasure.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02tSparx: This game came out before Scott Pilgrim was ever thought up...
<Buytoast> well the movie for sure
<Buytoast> never played the game
<Kirbyboy> is this the simpson arcade game?
<Buytoast> you can respectfully disagree all you want, the movie is still shit
<Canadian_Brony> hi Kirbyboy. Eeyup.
<tSparx> SuperBrony64: I've never seen this game before. Maybe Scott Pilgrim's just a mod of this.
<Kirbyboy> lol
<Canadian_Brony> Buytoast guilty pleasure.
<Canadian_Brony> IMO
<Buytoast> this game is from the early 90s son

*tSpx|HmwBnF replaces the posh club with a totally bitchin' club.

<tSpx|HmwBnF> Canadian_Brony: Idk how you use the word, but my friends and I have always taken posh to mean refined, upper-class.
<Wrek> 05and she clearly doesnt mind pretending

<CECtheRonin> Derpy_Hooves Gotcha.
<Canadian_Brony> tSpx|HmwBnF when I hear "posh", I picture an extreme germaphobe (beyond Rarity's standards) with an obviously fake accent. I would also expect them to be a bureaucrat.

<tSpx|Hwk> Phase4: (\
<MASF123|> Can you find a 4th player
<MASF123|> Because that game was hard.
<Derpy_Hooves> pretty sure i can
<Derpy_Hooves> that game was designed to be hard
<Derpy_Hooves> its a classic
<MASF123|> I unlocked sound test for clearing the game with Lisa
<Derpy_Hooves> a classic beat'em up
<Derpy_Hooves> i also like the scott pilgrim one
<MASF123|> That game was designed just likeany old aracde game to eat your quarters! :D
<MASF123|> But it's fun as hell.
<Derpy_Hooves> i also like the scott pilgrim one
<Canadian_Brony> Doom. A game made when America wasn't afraid to swear at everything.
<MASF123|> I have Scott Pilgrim, but it's not online...really Ubisoft...it's the year 2012. And it was released like last yaer!
<MASF123|> year
<Canadian_Brony> I need to get myself a copy of Doom. This looks intense. This is a SNES game, right?
<Buytoast> a game made when everyone wasn't such a little bitch about offending the stupid ravenous mobs of idiots with internet and media access*
<MASF123|> Oh no wait...music test I unlocked not sound test.
<tSpx|Hwk> Canadian_Brony: Doom is a PC game
<Flyboy> doom, a game that knew shotguns before they were cool
<tSpx|Hwk> Canadian_Brony: I know it had a port to some console(s), but I couldn't tell you which one(s)

<Dovah> Buytoast: Wisconsin stereo type: It's too cold to be sober!
<Buytoast> eh, all i know about wisconsin is that they love cheese, have the packers and have a state fair filled with animals, giant slides and that big ass piggy bank slide

<Canadian_Brony> When in doubt: Punch the living sh*t out of it
<Ponies47> XAX: Oh
<MaxTheBrony> Is this some kind of remake?
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<MASF123|> IDK
<MASF123|> Look at all those dead carcasses.
<Canadian_Brony> MaxTheBrony this is the PC version of Doom II IIRC
<tSpx|Hwk> MaxTheBrony: This is good ol' Doom.
<JRP|mumsPC> MaxTheBrony: its a port of doom to pc but its be modified
<MaxTheBrony> cause it looks pretty good :)
<Canadian_Brony> so much carnage
<MASF123|> so litle time
<Canadian_Brony> I love it
<MASF123|> WRek your good at Doom?
<tSpx|Hwk> JRP|mumsPC: Let's be clear: Doom was built on PC, ported everywhere else.
<MaxTheBrony> lol
<JRP|mumsPC> no
<Canadian_Brony> I need to find out where I can get the original SNES game
<JRP|mumsPC> tSpx|Hwk: doom was made for dos
<MASF123|> Wrek, your a Doom Veteran?
<AdamTheDuck_> Let the internet argument begin! :D
<tSpx|Hwk> JRP|mumsPC: DOS being an operating system for a PC...
<JRP|mumsPC> no
<MaxTheBrony> O.o i cant see the resemblance with this and Doom 3 :p
<AdamTheDuck_> Damn... HexChat doesn't have pony emoticons... :'(
<MASF123|> Doomguy is the original Heavy.
<MaxTheBrony> and thats why you stay on BS :)
<MASF123|> Chaingin all the way
<JRP|mumsPC> pc is gernral name for a computer with windows
<Canadian_Brony> Doomguy was Heavy before Heavy was Heacy
<Canadian_Brony> *Heavy
<tSpx|Hwk> JRP|mumsPC: Well then, what is DOS?
<MASF123|> Sasha belonged to Doomguy firat
<MASF123|> first
<JRP|mumsPC> fuck wrek i need to know what the port is called and mods
<JRP|mumsPC> so awsome
<MASF123|> Then Doomguy lost it and bought a new one
<MaxTheBrony> It would pretty cool if Heavy got Doom chaingun , soldier has the Quake Rocketlauncher
<MASF123|> Lol.
<MASF123|> Yeah
<tSpx|Hwk> JRP|mumsPC: nonono, I hate this, it's the most annoying thing from a computer geek's perspective about modern culture: a PC is any computer meant for personal use.
<MalkisAFK> -
<MASF123|> Yeah...multiuses
<tSpx|Hwk> It became popularly synonymous with Windows PCs, but this is incorrect.
<Canadian_Brony> hi MalkisAFK
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai MalkisAFK
<Canadian_Brony> I think he's AFK
<Canadian_Brony> just sayin;
<Canadian_Brony> *sayin'
<MalkisAFK> Hi im back I made myself a sandwhich
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<Canadian_Brony> WB MalkisAFK. Enjoy your Sandvic
<Canadian_Brony> *sandvich
<Canadian_Brony> I can't spell today
<MaxTheBrony> dem corrections xD
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back MalkisAFK
<JRP|mumsPC> wrek holy fuck.....
<JRP|mumsPC> soooo many stuff

<MASF123|> nah what will make you say that?
<MASF123|> sandvich
<MalkisAFK> So Tasty
<JRP|mumsPC> explaine the diffret betwen windows and dos
<MalkisAFK> windows is for people who dont know what does is JRP
<MalkisAFK> dos
<Canadian_Brony> seems legit
<Canadian_Brony> Windows for me
<Ponies47> Ponies47
<Ponies47> Wait that's me :P
<Canadian_Brony> you can't ping yourself
<Canadian_Brony> I've tried
<MalkisAFK> Windows and Linux for me
<Ponies47> I know Canadian_Brony :P
<Canadian_Brony> and yes, that is you.
<MaxTheBrony> Somone go redo this chaingun for tf2 :D?
<tSpx|Hwk> DOS is a family of operating systems, they were text-based. MS-DOS was Microsoft's variant of DOS. Then, when Windows added the modern Windows system (based largely off the X Window Management system) that lets you have programs open in windows on your computer, they named their new OS after that feature.
<tSpx|Hwk> Windows and Linux for me too.
<MalkisAFK> MaxTheBrony Ill get strait to work on that after my Barbie girl parody and a pony version of me
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<Canadian_Brony> and that feature stuck forever
<MalkisAFK> Yep Brohoof tSpx
<MalkisAFK> k
<AdamTheDuck> I miss pony emoticons, back to BronyState for me. :D
<MalkisAFK> 6_9 like this?
<AdamTheDuck> Yay ponies!
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<Canadian_Brony> :)
<AdamTheDuck> Who needs reliable IRL's when you have ponies.
<MalkisAFK> Here comes the endless spamming of ponies
<MaxTheBrony> Exactly AdamTheDuck :)
<tSpx|Hwk> There's gotta be a way to integrate the pony emoticons into my client, but I've yet to tinker around with it.
<MaxTheBrony> Lol O.o wrek was walking on their heads :P
<MalkisAFK> Ponies and Brony Friends
<MalkisAFK> FOREVER
<MaxTheBrony> <3 :)
<MalkisAFK> and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever...etc
<Canadian_Brony> I would stay for more, but I need to be up at 7:30am today and it's almost 1:00am.
<Canadian_Brony> I'm hitting the hay. G'night everypony.

<MalkisAFK> And I mean that in a serious manner not a joking one
<JRP> wrek what doom is this ?
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: I'm worried that you're being sarcastic, but that's probably just because I'm secretly increidlby socially unsure of myself.
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: Yay you weren't insulting me! Haha, thanks :) *blush*
<MaxTheBrony> This looks funnier than most games that come out "today"
<MalkisAFK> Not at all I have a weird responce where the more tired I am the more social and sometimes Serious tSpx|Hwk
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: Well, my sleep schedule has descended into madness, so it's pure luck that I'm wide awake at 3am (UTC-5) xD

<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: A) Why are you still nick'd AFK
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: B) I know you meant graduation, I'm gonna pretend you meant degradation :P
<MalkisAFK> degradation?
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: Fancy noun for the act of making fun of and/or belittling someone.
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: Hence the term, "I found this degrading!"
<MaxTheBrony> :3
<tSpx|Hwk> Whence*
<MalkisAFK> tSpx|Hwk ok now that you had your fun ask about the certificate
<tSpx|Hwk> Oh wow, that was the most pretentious thing I ever posted here lol

<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: That's awesome!
<MalkisAFK> Yay wish it was cash
<MalkisAFK> but then again I know how I would spend it so shes smart to make it a certificate
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<MalkisAFK> on ponies
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: Haha, if I had 20,000 all at once, I would spend it on... er, somethign that isn't particularly useful.
<tSpx|Hwk> So I'd want it in certificate form.
<MalkisAFK> Ya
<XylemTube> WOOOOOO more brutal mod
<MalkisAFK> eyup
<tSpx|Hwk> Hey Xylem
<MalkisAFK> Hi Xylem
<XylemTube> Hello!
<MalkisAFK> Nice to meet you XylemTube hows your morning?
<tSpx|Hwk> I guess my /friendship was *too* powerful :/
<MaxTheBrony> Heya XylemTube :)
<MalkisAFK> tSpx|Hwk can you recommend a car by the way?
<tSpx|Hwk> I'm years away from buying a car, so I don't know what's in that price range really.
<XylemTube> MalkisAFK: my morning is alright. I'ma find a job
<Eulshy> Buy a PT cruiser
<MalkisAFK> I heard the honda civics good
<Eulshy> Those look cool
<XylemTube> and then buy a motorcycle
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: The only thing I'd say is that you want a coupe/sedan/etc., and that you REALLY WANT A STICKSHIFT. Even if you don't know how to drive one, learn.
<tSpx|Hwk> So worth it.
<MalkisAFK> XylemTube thats good and good luck
<tSpx|Hwk> Xylem Gl on the job hunt! Recently unemployed myself, I'll race you :P
<MalkisAFK> tSpx|Hwk I know im just how you say lazy

<MaxTheBrony> :D
<MalkisAFK> tSpx|Hwk you do get better mileage but you know diffrence from knowing and driving like that everyday
<XylemTube> Nice, this game has assasinations
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: What? I can't decide if I missed something or if that sentence doesn't make sense, but it doesn't make sense to me.
<MaxTheBrony> haha , that sentence is pretty unreadable
<MalkisAFK> and how am I gonna talk on my cell phone and eat chicken and do manual same time?
<Eulshy> PT Cruiser
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: YOu find a way.
<MalkisAFK> Eulshy you better get commission for pushing them PT Cruisers
<tSpx|Hwk> And on the highway of course you never have to shift.
<tSpx|Hwk> Well, "never," no. Seldom though.
<MalkisAFK> tSpx|Hwk well well you never ever have to if you get automatic
<XylemTube> I love this shotty
<XylemTube> the double barreled one
<MalkisAFK> tSpx|Hwk no responce...?
<MaxTheBrony> I wish the engi got the Dubble barreld Shotgun And heavy got the chaingun from this game :)
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: Yeah, but seriously, it never gets my way anymore. As I tell people, "I can do it manually when I need to, and I do it automatically when I don't."
<MalkisAFK> I keep getting reminded that there are 85 people in this room seems like only 6 are chatting
<MaxTheBrony> yeah , that happens :p
<MaxTheBrony> everyone is asleeep
<MalkisAFK> eccept for us cause we weird
<MalkisAFK> ;)
<MalkisAFK> In a good way
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: Though if I got to buy a car in that price range, it would be a newer (and better-taken-care-of) version of the car I currently drive: I own a '97 non-SH, I'd get an '01 Honda Prelude SH
<MalkisAFK> Speak english not car talk
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: It's only a 4-cylinder, but with a DOHC system and some clever engineering, you get a lot of bang for your buck.
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: Oh, sorry xD
<tSpx|Hwk> So, Honda sells a 2-door car, the Prelude. I drive a 1997 edition, they stopped making them in 2001.
<MalkisAFK> tSpx|Hwk I can only talk simple this early in the morning
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: They're something of a collector's item, so they're often well taken care of, but they're only *something* of a collector's item, so you can definitely find it for under 20 grand.
<MalkisAFK> Hope you guys are happy because in 4 years ill be taking care of your internet and landlines so dont make me mad
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: It's a 5-speed (in manual) car that is really sport for a non-sports car. I can get up to 90 mph without even noticing it, haha, and my car was treated like shit before I bought it.
<MelaPonie> tSpx|Hwk, what is a "collectors" thing?
<tSpx|Hwk> MalkisAFK: The 2001 Honda Prelude Sport's Handling (SH) edition was ranked best car of the year (in its price-range) by Car & Driver.
<XylemTube> Nooooooooo
<MalkisAFK> 2 words Honda Prius tSpx|Hwk
<SirGanjalf> morning everyone

<SuperBrony64> 11,02But yeah, nopony uses the Luna room either :/
<SuperBrony64> 11,02They're just there to attract dust >3>
<Phase4> 00,02i'd rather if they did, dont really like skype
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Why?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02with Skype you can get a backlog of messages and tell when somepony else is typing
<Phase4> 00,02and how often do you use those features :P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02><
<SuperBrony64> 11,02All the time :)
<Gold_Demona> Good morning, Bronysta-- OMG IS THAT DOOM II?!
<Jmo> Morning Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> IT IS!!!
<Phase4> 00,02excluding the typing one :<
<Gold_Demona> Oh my childhood! ^^
<Gold_Demona> This is LATE in the game, too.
<Gold_Demona> Looks like a weapons mod.
<Gold_Demona> Man, I had SO many Doom 2 mods back in the day.
<Gold_Demona> Wow, the chat's really dead...
<Jmo> Yep :>
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Honestly, I like being able to come back online and see the past messages on Skype.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02On IRC, you can't do that unless you're connected the entire time :/
<Gold_Demona> Kill that Cacodemon!
<alexxm> hey guys
<Gold_Demona> Hi alexxm
<alexxm> how you doing Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> Oh! This isn't the regular game, I see.
<Gold_Demona> I'm doing alright alexxm. Just logged on myself
<Gold_Demona> Woah! What powerup was that? I don't remember ever seeing that in the game
<XylemTube> This is Brutal Doom
<Gold_Demona> For those that get bored with the regular game, I take it?
<Gold_Demona> heh, dat broken scren.
<Gold_Demona> screen*
<Phase4> 00,02you can use an irc bouncer, or otherwise keep it online. the problem i have is that skypes interface is bad and it wont stop making noises
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You can always turn off the sounds on Skype :/
<Gold_Demona> Holy crap, that's a lot of demons. I'd've been dead like two seconds into this.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Or set 'Do Not Disturb' mode
<Phase4> 00,02i set the do not disturb mode
<Phase4> 00,02it keeps blinking the taskbar anyway
<Phase4> 00,02very noisy program
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Well...it just started doing that in the latest update because before it wouldn't blink at all in DnD mode :/
<MadSurge> Good morning Bronystate! DOOM <3
<Gold_Demona> Hiya MadSurge. I had the same reaction. lol
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Doom 2 was my first "serious" game :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Doom 2 was my first FPS
<Gold_Demona> I played the holy crap out of that game.
<Gold_Demona> I suck at shooters though, so I always played with IDDQD. :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Well. I finished at least in too young to die before knowing of the codes :D
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> I could never finish the game fair. That last level I could never figure out
<MadSurge> Who's strea-oh nevermind, it's Wreky
<Gold_Demona> I always had to use IDCLIP and shoot the head on a spike to finish it.
<Gold_Demona> Which if I remember right was the developer's head.
<Alchemist> idspispopd was the noclip code in doom 1 if i remember right
<Gold_Demona> I didn't play Doom 1, so I couldn't tell ya
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: that's kinda unintuitive eh? Shoot the exposed brain using the platform's elevation to time it
<Alchemist> doom1 used to scare the crap outta me when i was a kid
<Alchemist> especially the noise the pinky demon does when it notices you
<MadSurge> Alchemist: idspispopd, one of the first internet jokes :D
<Alchemist> MadSurge: really? Im not aware of that. I didnt have internet till about 1998
<Gold_Demona> I wonder if I still have any Doom Wads lying around somewhere...
<MadSurge> Take out id, and the initials mean "smashing pumpkins into small piles of putrid debris" :D
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Alchemist> O_O what does that even mean? :D
<Alchemist> what is the background for this, or the reason they made this acronym as a noclip code?
<MadSurge> If i remember correctly it was some guy joking about the still unnamed game's name ( it was beta testers I think)
<Gold_Demona> Is this mode just waves of Imps, Barons, and Cacodemons?
<Gold_Demona> Oh and regular Demona
<Gold_Demona> demons*
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: THROW MORE MONSTERS AT HIM
<Gold_Demona> Throw in an Arachnotron or two
<MadSurge> Heh, RIP AND TEAR! mode :D
<Gold_Demona> Maybe just a Spiderdemon
<Alchemist> cracking visor upon dmage? more realism than cod where you get strawberry jelly on screen upon damage? how?
<XylemTube> Victory!
<Gold_Demona> Fatality!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: no cyberdemons though please
<Gold_Demona> Nooooo, I hate cyberdemons. o_o
<Alchemist> oh and I just recently read that one of the "famous" speedrunners of doom wads is hungarian :)
<Gold_Demona> Maybe a Mancubus or two.
<MadSurge> Archviles :D
<MadSurge> REVENANTS D:
*SuperBrony64 hugs dat Phase4 :3
*Phase4 00,02hugs SuperBrony64 back
<Gold_Demona> Ugh, Revenants! I hated those two
<MadSurge> Today, chat is ded .__.
<Gold_Demona> too*
<alexxm> huh
<alexxm> chat seems rather ded
<Gold_Demona> Yep
<MadSurge> SPLAT
<Gold_Demona> Doing all this with a rifle? Ya nuts?
<MadSurge> YOU ARE HUUUGE! THAT MEANS YOU HAVE HUGE GUTS!!
<XylemTube> Dat Circle Straife
*alexxm hugs MadSurge
<Gold_Demona> Ok, the rifle's superpowered, nevermind
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: level design at its finest
<MadSurge> Hey alexxm :)
<MadSurge> YAAAAAY
<Gold_Demona> Dude, this rifle's twice as powerful as how the shotgun normally is
<alexxm> how've things been MadSurge
<Gold_Demona> There's the shotgun, lol
<MadSurge> alexxm: *shrugs* normal I guess
<Gold_Demona> I always loved hitting the pink demons in the face with the rocket launcher
<Spell-of-Gaming> hai everypony :3
<Gold_Demona> Hello Spell_of_Gaming
<alexxm> how've things been Spell-of-Gaming
<Spell-of-Gaming> Who's streaming?
<Gold_Demona> Wrek is streaming
<MadSurge> Hey Spell-of-Gaming! Wreky is
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...Wrek, how long have you been playing this?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Let me guess... at least 8 hours, right?
<MadSurge> Spell-of-Gaming: beats me, I got up at 10:30 AM today :D
<Eulshy> BLUE ARMOR
<Eulshy> hell yeah
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's like... 5:17 PM here.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I spied a while ago, and saw Wrek streaming.
<Eulshy> It's 4:17 AM here:)
<Eulshy> Why am i not asleep
<Gold_Demona> It's 5:18am over here right now
<MadSurge> Eulshy: awww, go to bed!
<Spell-of-Gaming> And that "a while ago" was pratically like, 5 hours ago.
<Gold_Demona> I just got OUT of bed. =P
<Eulshy> MadSurge I can't, my brother has all these annoying lights on
<Gold_Demona> Well tell him to turn on not-so-annoying lights. :P
<MadSurge> Eulshy: aw shit, light keeps me awake too D:
<Eulshy> Rvil fings
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: wow, early bird eh?
<Eulshy> I keep looking over at him, he's playing WoW
<dar-k-stalkers> at least you have lights in your room
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I wake up with my husband. He's the early bird. =P
<Eulshy> My room has no walls
<Gold_Demona> I make his breakfast, pack his lunch and shove him out the door to work.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I hate my school's schedule.
<Eulshy> The entire basement floor has no walls
<Spell-of-Gaming> I have to be an early bird.
<Eulshy> so i see all the lights
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: what does your hubby do?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: He loads trucks at a milk bottling plant.
<Eulshy> Mmm milk
<Gold_Demona> He puts the finished product onto the trucks
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: so he's big and strong? :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> I need to go to school before 7:00 am.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ugh.
<Gold_Demona> Strong yes, but not big. He's tall and kinda lanky. =P
<Spell-of-Gaming> Thank god it's National Hero's Day here.
<Eulshy> I'ma go yell at my brother to go to bed so i can turn these lights off.
<Eulshy> Goodnight hopefully
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Aww yeah!
<Spell-of-Gaming> Are these monsters seriously killing someone in a weapons room...?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Stupid AI.
<Gold_Demona> lol, Sure looks like it
<Gold_Demona> This level needs some Commander Keens. =/
<Spell-of-Gaming> Durr, I have too many headcanons.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I think my head is gonna explode.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: that was so awesome, I liked Commander Keen too :D
<Gold_Demona> I never played Commander Keen, actually. I was referring to the Commander Keen easter egg in Doom II. XD
<Gold_Demona> In that one bonus level where you had to kill the four Commander Keen figures to open the exit
<Gold_Demona> After shooting past all the Wolfenstein Nazis, lol
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yeah, I know :D
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Gold_Demona> Actually... Now that I think about it, Wolfenstein was actually my first FPS. XD
<MadSurge> I wanna Wrek try one of those insane mods where it's you vs a million enemies :D
<MASF123> whoa
<MadSurge> ARCHVILE
<Gold_Demona> Archviles are annoying.
<MadSurge> BEST RESPAWN POINT EVER :D

<DeadpoolDash> i am a night person, the sun is my enemy
<Phase4> 00,02MASF123, fair enough
<Gold_Demona> That is such a cool powerup.
<MASF123> Stangely enough I had a nightmare before I played with SB64 and Derpy_hooves
<Gold_Demona> I have to get me some breakfast.
<MASF123> Yeah me too.
<dar-k-stalkers> Deadpool: are you a vampire?
<MadSurge> There was a similar power up in the Catacombs game :D
<DeadpoolDash> nope, too hairy to be a vamp
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Really? o.o
<Gold_Demona> Are those hellknights or barons? I can't tell...
<MadSurge> Hey SuperBrony64! :)
<MadSurge> I think Hellknights
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai :3
<Gold_Demona> I know the knights are the browner ones and the barons are the pinker ones, but I can't tell what color they are in all that red.
<Gold_Demona> It's nice watching somebody play who's actually good at this game. XD
<SuperBrony64> 11,0211:34 AM? Wow, I'm asleep by then, you should get some rest >>
*Gold_Demona eats cereal while watching the pixelated carnage
<MASF123> Who get some rest?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: their scream is more high pitched
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Also, Wrek, not watching the stream atm, but I have a request...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Can I have a copy of your awesome art powers? I'll pay for shipping if I have to :I

<MadSurge> SuperBrony64: then it's just me :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gold_Demona, Pfffffffffft casual
<MASF123> Coffee tastes bad...well for me.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> I don't like coffee if I don't sweeten the crap out of it. :P
<MadSurge> I don't like hot drinks... if it's not chocolate :D
<MASF123> Mmmmm....Hot choclate.
<Gold_Demona> I like Coffee with chocolate. Mmmmm mocha. ^^
*MASF123 foams out mouth
<Gold_Demona> *fills mug with milk* *heats milk in microwave* *adds instant coffe and sugar* *drinks happily*

<Gold_Demona> Mmm pillow
<MadSurge> Well it's almost lunch time here too
<MASF123> Mmmmm....Hot pillows.
*MASF123 foams out mouth
<Gold_Demona> Ooh! I love this music track! =D
<MadSurge> SUDDENDLY
<Gold_Demona> Doom II had awesome music. :3
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yep
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Have you ever heard the Doom album on OC Remix?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: only a few tracks I think
<Gold_Demona> I like the one that was made to this track.
<Gold_Demona> I've always wanted to hear this song played with actual instruments.
<Gold_Demona> Like the "electric guitar" that's playing here
<MASF123> so much turning FPS sometimes make me dizzy.
<Gold_Demona> And this game is faux 3d. It's a lot worse in games with ACTUAL 3d. =P
<MASF123> What do you mean?
<Gold_Demona> Doom 2's graphics engine isn't actually 3d. It's a two dimensional map with two-dimensional graphics. The raised structures and such give the illusion of 3d.
<MASF123> but isn't the map 3D?
<Gold_Demona> nope
<Wrek> 05basically advanced raytracing
<MASF123> What about Resident Evil 1 and 2?
<MASF123> I heard they aren't in 3D either.
<Gold_Demona> I don't know about RE. I just know about Doom. =P
<MASF123> So this is all sprites?
<Gold_Demona> Yup
<MASF123> What the hell.
<Gold_Demona> Flat 2-dimensional sprites
<MadSurge> TRAP'D
<MadSurge> SURPRISE
<MASF123> Duke Nukem 3D uses the same engine as Doom?
<MASF123> I heard they got sued for that.
<MASF123> And mocking that "Doomed Space Marine"
<MadSurge> Id had little patience for Apogee, after screwing with them like they did
<Gold_Demona> BFG-9000 Hell yeah!
<MASF123> Big Fucking Gun-9000?
<Gold_Demona> Eeyup
<MadSurge> Yep!
<Gold_Demona> That's what it's called
<MASF123> not in the Doom movie. 6_9
<MadSurge> YOU WIN WREK! :D
<Gold_Demona> Yay~
<MadSurge> MASF123: because the movie was too much of a pussy :D
<Gold_Demona> The movie sucked balls. Only part of it that was good was when the hero got that powerup and we got that whole scene from his POV.
<Gold_Demona> Especially when he picked up the chainsaw. Huge nostalgiagasm there.
<MASF123> Is Doom good? Or do you need to love FPS?
<MASF123> Because FPS don't always satisfy my needs.
<Gold_Demona> I think it's fun, but it lacks plot.
<MASF123> Timesplitters: Future Perfect is a good one.
<Alchemist> MASF123: depends. if you havent played it yet you might not like but those who played it when it came out its still good because of nostalgic value.
<MASF123> ANd I like Perfect Dark and GOldeneye
<Gold_Demona> Goldeneye is really good. Never played Perfect Dark.
<MASF123> Alchemist makes sense
<Gold_Demona> My favorite though is Half Life 2
<MASF123> Perfect Dark is from the team that brought you GOldeneye
<MASF123> And Timesplitter is from the people that brought you Perfect Dark
<MASF123> Basically old Rare before they went to Microsoft.
<Gold_Demona> heh
<MASF123> Perfect Dark is like Goldeneye but with a sequel in an alternate universe.
<Pinkie_Brony> Kick, Kick, Kick, shorgun blast! XD
<MASF123> Instead of James Bond you play as Joanna Dark who is also and Secret Agent.
<Sumica> 00,10multy player?
<Gold_Demona> heh
<MASF123> James Bond hard difficulty is 007, in Perfect Dark it's Perfect Agent
<MASF123> I perfer the N64 version over the XBLA version though.
<MASF123> ...is the chat ded? I'm the only one talking.
<Pinkie_Brony> nope XD
<Gold_Demona> I don't have any useful input. =P
<Pinkie_Brony> Hi MAS
<MadSurge> Aww yeah, Slayer-bases track!
<MASF123> Anyone like Duke Nukem?
<MASF123> Hi Pinkie_Brony
<Pinkie_Brony> Never played it
<Pinkie_Brony> I heard the new one didn't do so well
<MadSurge> I played the old PLATFORMER Duke Nukem games! :D
<Gold_Demona> I liked the Duken Nuken platformer game. Didn't like it so much when they made it an FPS.
<Gold_Demona> I loved that platformer. Running around and shooting things and collecting the letters in Duke's name. =P
<MASF123> I played the FPS one and A Time to Kill and Zer0 Hour
