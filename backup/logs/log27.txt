<luna> It should work

<Armageddon> o-o
<Armageddon> on *:TEXT:*hi*:#: { msg $chan reply here }
<Armageddon> @ luna
<luna> I didnt want to have to do a new on text

<MajinMew> make script so each time i speak, a 3 is randomly placed in my words
<prince-dari> That's yours script, the rest isn't included.

<luna> yeah
<luna> i noticed that
<luna> lol
<MajinMew> oh
<LunarTopaz> Exactly. I still think this consecutive thing is just some new extravegance that you guys are using for point fishing
<MajinMew> i don't know msl stop yelling at me

<luna> lol
<luna> sp
<luna> so*
<luna> it needs a timer still
<luna> because it's messaging too fast
<luna> what timer, .timer 1 1
<luna> or at
<luna> wat*
<luna> derp.
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> O_o
<luna> it messages
<luna> right before it joins
<luna> because of the join timer being 1 1
<Trony> I see dat GET thread.
<luna> .timer 11 join #
<luna> 1 1*
<luna> so i need a slower timer for the msg
<CaitSith> Add a timer to the msg # part?
<prince-dari> ^
<luna> ya
<luna> but
<lightumbreon> i heard what happend, how are you now?
<luna> what ammount
<luna> lol

<prince-dari> Do 0.1 0
<Skylands> 10Huh?
<CaitSith> Don't do that.
<prince-dari> :P
<luna> it still
<luna> messages
<luna> too quickly
<prince-dari> So make
<prince-dari> the timer
<prince-dari> wait
<prince-dari> for longer
<prince-dari> Also
<prince-dari> why
<prince-dari> you talk
<prince-dari> like this?
<luna> idk
<lightumbreon> you were stung? or am i still not better? X.x
<SirSprinkles> 6lulz and then you get consecutives.

<LunarTopaz> Don't I have to at this point?
<SirSprinkles> 6Pretty much.
<lightumbreon> good
<LunarTopaz> I'm tied for fifth now
<LunarTopaz> but I have a plan

<luna> let me unload it
<eXAKR> what happened to Skylands?

<LunarTopaz> I'd update the site but I forgot the password

<LunarTopaz> Have to wait until CF comes back on
<SirSprinkles> 6I got dub sings and consecs, luckily saved.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm actually starting to screencap things. XD
<Skylands> 10On my vacation trip, I was stung by a sting ray
<eXAKR> ich
<eXAKR> not good
<Espeon> 06Oh :<
<eXAKR> You know that killed Steve Irwin ><
<LunarTopaz> lulz
<LunarTopaz> So who's hosting today? DCD again?
<Skylands> 10Yeah, this one was pretty small though
<prince-dari> You have to be pretty unlucky to get stung in the head by one though.
<eXAKR> You know, my dad told me that one of my uncles was stung by a sting ray too
<eXAKR> he nearky died
<eXAKR> *nearly
<Skylands> 10Depends on the size
<Skylands> 10This one was no bigger than a small bowl
<eXAKR> he was telling me that after the Steve Irwin getting stung news broke
<eXAKR> hmmm
<eXAKR> you still want to be careful
<eXAKR> Seen a doctor?
<Skylands> 10No, the lifeguards gave me this heat pack and told me to keep it on for 30 minutes to ooze the pain
<eXAKR> Ah OK
<eXAKR> if you feel funny though, get a doctor really fast
<Skylands> 10And they also noted, "If you haven't had your shots in the last 10 years, you should consider getting them"
<Skylands> 10Which I have, in fact last back in April, so I'm good
<Espeon> 06That's good.
<prince-dari> Somehow I've never been stung by a jellyfish - even though I see them pretty often in the sea.
<prince-dari> Anyone here been stung by a jellyfish?
<Skylands> 10Me LOL
*Skylands gets bad luck
<prince-dari> Hahaha, you're a magnet for stining creatures.
<Skylands> 10This jellyfish was just floating around when I was swimming in the deeper end of the ocean
<SirSprinkles> 6Uh... I think it's Redfield. DCD has something to do.
<SirSprinkles> 6Pretty sure.
<Skylands> 10It wrapped its legs around my arm
<eXAKR> I was at the beach once and there was someone scooping up jellyfish and putting them in a makeshift lagoon someone made
<eXAKR> and there was children all over looking at them
<prince-dari> Yeah, I've seen a couple of people catch them for whatever reason.
<prince-dari> I did once have the bad luck of walking on some fish hook someone left in on the beach though.
<Skylands> 10As if that scarred me enough to avoid the ocean, this sting ray was right by the shore line
<LunarTopaz> So no Kamen Riders Rape? Glory glory glory
<LunarTopaz> lol
<luna> hm
<luna> i got it to only say it once
<eXAKR> and I ewas telling everyone, don't touch them and don't get your feet in the water
<luna> after 4 seconds
<luna> but
<eXAKR> or the jellyfish will sting you
<luna> it's still doing it for anyone who gets kicked
<eXAKR> *was
<prince-dari> You probably didn't put everying inside the if statement.
<eXAKR> Skylands ‚Ä∫ It wrapped its legs around my arm <- you mean its tentacles
<Skylands> 10Whatever
<SirSprinkles> 6You never know.
<Skylands> 10Exotic creatures like me, I've never been stung by something more common such as bees/wasps
<SirSprinkles> 6He is a friend of DCD's.
<LunarTopaz> Blarg
<Armageddon> try #spam or something
<eXAKR> heh
<prince-dari> I don't get why people who aren't alergic are so afraid of bees and wasps.
<LunarTopaz> I won't be here for the movies, but I always enjoy the preshow
<luna> for wat
<eXAKR> the most I have here are mosquitoes
<eXAKR> and I never got dengue fever
<eXAKR> I guess I'm lucky
<prince-dari> That reminds me, they had some freaky super mosquitoes in France.
<eXAKR> Dengue fever is a real problem in Singapore
<prince-dari> Bigger then the ones I see here and they were sort of red.
<SilverSonic> your Lunaron bot
<prince-dari> than*

<eXAKR> I don't even.
<LunarTopaz> Her, !!Pinkiepie, and !!Spike are my favorite mods
<eXAKR> I think I have to stay very very far away from that park that offers pony rides that I mentioned a long time ago

*SilverSonic goes to tell his sister about his pony obsession
<eXAKR> "Um. You've got a yacht. And... Boys! Loads of fellas. Hunky guys down there. Possibly even a boyfriend! Who's to say at this stage. But, a lot of good looking fellas down there. And, ah, a boy band as well! That haven't seen a woman in years. And they're not picky at all. They don't care if you've got a bit of brain damage. If you've been running around sweating. And... A farm! A pony
<eXAKR> farm! And... Just jump down, would ya?"
<eXAKR> Wheatley says that at some point in Portal 2
<eXAKR> If you go back to the bottomless pit
<eXAKR> Oo;;;
<SkyRyd3r> Eh
<SkyRyd3r> Dunno what to say but honestly why get scared by your sister if she finds out about Pokemon chat sites...
<SkyRyd3r> Unless she'll send you to the nearest asylum for it
<SkyRyd3r> Then there's a problem
<eXAKR> I now know why Portal 2 and MLP: FiM gets crossed so much
<eXAKR> she might
<eXAKR> MIGHT
<SilverSonic> she will
<prince-dari> [15:32] <SkyRyd3r> Dunno what to say but honestly why get scared by your sister if she finds out about Pokemon chat sites... He's talking about her finding out about him liking ponies.
<SilverSonic> anyone with a MLP: FiM obsession needs to go to a correction center

<prince-dari> Such an old GIF, still good though.
<Espeon> 06I mean I really don't care about the ponies in any way - neither positive nor negative - unless it's like PONIESPONIESPONIES in the middle of some actual conversation.
<Espeon> 06Same as spamming really.
<Espeon> 06:3
<prince-dari> Generally there's no one talking when I post ponies anyway, and I don't spam it, so I don't see why people complain.
<prince-dari> It's pretty easy to ignore, hell, they can even set me to ignore so it doesn't show up.

<Steve> Pretty much that's what I meant
<SirSprinkles> 6Soldier does that.
<Hipster_Brony> 8its so weird
<Damos> Remember the white lines are for loading and not the red lines
<Hipster_Brony> 8its like he reaches into my brain, takes my thoughts and makes them coherent
<Damos> the red lines are for loading and the white lines are not
<SirSprinkles> 6He seems to do that with a lot of things.
<Damos> you idiot it the white lines that are for boarding and the red lines that are prohibited
*Armads whales Damos over the head with a grape juice bottle
<SirSprinkles> 6But I don't like the giant wall of text thing.
*Damos doesn't get whaled
<SirSprinkles> 6I love that he gives great advice, but the walls of text are... bleh.
<Damos> lol Airplane
<Hipster_Brony> 8i normally dont, but im ok with it when he does it
<Hipster_Brony> 8most long posts like that i dont read because i dont want to invest the time, but its totally worth it for his posts
<Armads> Pot pies always taste better when you have to wait unreasonable amounts of time for them.
<SirSprinkles> 6Cursed sleep schedule and my lack of one.

*Jerry glomps
<Hipster_Brony> 8i had a virus for a while that wouldnt let me shut down my computer
<SirSprinkles> 6That's... incredibly odd.
<Hipster_Brony> 8so i had to manually turn the power off everytime and run scandisk
<Hipster_Brony> 8it also made it so that, after a certain amount of time, no programs would open
*HyperMetalLugia falls over
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, one of those.

<prince-dari> Lol, you know that's an MLP meme right?
<SirSprinkles> 6Thank the lord.

<DubstepMaster> GOOD EVENING BRONIES!!!!!!
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe in the year before they release it, they'll readd it :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Or the Wii U is too different, so they couldn't add Wii and GC (silly if the reason is true, they're almost the same)
<CaitSith> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Good evening.
<SirSprinkles> 6And good to hear DCD
<Jerry> about the PSPVita=me goes o.o
<prince-dari> It was probably just cheaper for them not to provide it (like after a year no PS3s were at all backwards compatible).
<Jerry> 3G+Wifi? come on..you have got to be kidding me..
<prince-dari> LOL PSPVita.
<prince-dari> What is that? Touch pad on the BACK? WHAT IS THIS MADNESS?!?!?

<HyperMetalLugia> You are right :P

<Skylands> 10Never said I liked it

<HyperMetalLugia> We'll see about that after season 2
<Armads> That show was more just disturbing than anything.

<Hipster_Brony> 8nice
<Angel_Espeon> 13I still need to watch PSG sometime
<Skylands> 10I usually change every week or every 2 weeks
<prince-dari> lightlugia: I suppose we'll agree to disagree then.
<Jerry> because your just that awesome
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont get, but i have gotten dubs, trips, quads and quints before
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've been told that I might get bored of it after a while, but we'll see :B
*Jerry SHOT
<SirSprinkles> 6I have the magical inability to GET quints.

<Skylands> 10It does get boring
<SirSprinkles> 6They would skyrocket me to the top of the list, just can't GET them.
*Jerry didnt change it for a year_
<Hipster_Brony> 8i got them accidentally one day
<Armads> 'cause I'm boring like that.
<luna> nope.
<HyperMetalLugia> A couple of episodes are boring at times :P
<Jerry> year+
<lightlugia> @prince-dari: ORLY?
<luna> ergh
<luna> i'm gonna ask i #mIRC
<HyperMetalLugia> But the others are odd
<luna> in*
<Skylands> 10Especially episode... 7? With the Transformers reference
<Hipster_Brony> 8yesterday, i got devils trips TWICE
<HyperMetalLugia> That wasn't boring at all XD
*Skylands checks
<Skylands> 10I thought so
<HyperMetalLugia> Now episode 8/9 I think
<HyperMetalLugia> Fun
<SirSprinkles> 6I saw that.
<Hipster_Brony> 8accidental both times, because all my gets are accidental
<Hipster_Brony> 8i was a little worried
<Angel_Espeon> 13How many episodes are there?
<SirSprinkles> 6My first post on ponychan was actually a 777.
<Armads> Twelve I think.
<HyperMetalLugia> 13ish
<Skylands> 1013
<Skylands> 10with an OVA
<HyperMetalLugia> Including a 10min episode thingy
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ah, I'll probably watch the whole thing then :B
<Skylands> 10I finished it in 2 days (yesterday, and the day before)
<Armads> Good luck, Angel.
<HyperMetalLugia> I finished in January XD
<Skylands> 10The one thing that's good about PSG is...
<Skylands> 10the soundtrack
<HyperMetalLugia> Or something close...
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes, the music
<HyperMetalLugia> And the suggestiveness too :P
<Armads> Nah.
<Armads> Soundtrack only.

<Hipster_Brony> 8although i only posted like 3 or 4 times in 4 chan, i was familiar with chan culture, so i assumed it would be the same, with anonymity being favored
<HyperMetalLugia> Draw Stocking
<HyperMetalLugia> Or Chuck
*HyperMetalLugia hides
<Hipster_Brony> 8after a few weeks, i realized that it was not at all similar to 4chan
<Espeon> 06Kyubey vs Espeon staring contest.
<Espeon> 06Or rather no
<Armads> I once beat a snake in a staring contest.
<Jerry> o.o seriously?
<SirSprinkles> 6I used to lurk 4chan. Never posted though.
<Armads> ya.
<Armads> it was tough
<Armads> but I prevailed in the end.
<Armads> snakes are skilled and clever foes.
<prince-dari> How? Don't they have no eyelids?
<Armads> Very carefully.
<prince-dari> (I don't know much about snakes)
<SirSprinkles> 6Wow, I MUST be tired.
<SirSprinkles> 6I just realized I was furiously refreshing when I still had to wait another 900 posts for a big GET.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<Sakuya> So I made ramen for lunch, but the employee lounge apparently ran out of plastic forks
<Sakuya> So I'm using coffee stirers for chop sticks
<Armads> Get two pens and use them as chopsticks.
<Armads> lol
<Sakuya> ...lol
<Armads> I did that once at school.
<Ghosties> 4Man, I'm bored
<Sakuya> Problem is
<Hipster_Brony> 8me too
<Sakuya> It tastes like wood now
<SirSprinkles> 6Same.
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats why i started that thread
<Sakuya> Screw it, I'm using fingers
<Armads> Maybe stop gnawing on trees?
<SirSprinkles> 6DCD needs to be done getting dragged on errands now.

<Ghosties> 4Hey chat
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Ghosties> 4Are you going to be around for the BMN tonight?
<Armads> Jack the Knife sounds like an awesome codename for a serial killer.
<prince-dari> Maybe, I doubt I can make the whole of it though.
<prince-dari> Because it ends at something like 2 AM without the aftershow for me, and I have a fair ammount of work to do.

<Ghosties> 4I was away for like 5 minutes and I come back to Sprinkles and Hipster having a "who's epeen is bigger" contest
<SirSprinkles> 6I know. That's why I did so many more.
<Ghosties> 4What the fuck

<Ghosties> 4Well, this could go very bad
<SirSprinkles> 6I'M DANCIN' I'M DANCIN'
<SirSprinkles> 6So am I, silly chat voice.
<Ghosties> 4You guys know there's a thread over on /pony/ about the Wired topic that talked about Bronies, yeah?
<SirSprinkles> 6Did not know that, Ghosties.
<Ghosties> 4Well, there is
<SirSprinkles> 6What question, silly voice?
<Ghosties> 4I said something about how the media always finds the worst representations of communities to portray to the rest of the world, and I said that the general public now probably think we're all middle aged manbabies with Asperger's syndrome that have nothing better to do than collect MLP toys from McDonalds
<Ghosties> 4Now, I didn't read anything else in the thread, I just said what I wanted to say
<Ghosties> 4After posting, I scrolled up a little and do you know what I saw?
<SirSprinkles> 6...we can do that?
<SirSprinkles> 6Explain how, silly voice.
<Ghosties> 4I saw Luke Allen
<Ghosties> 4posting

<Damos> thats what she said
<Black_Latios> 2D:<
<Ghosties> 4Okay, never mind
<Ghosties> 4I got it
*Jerry gives Black_Latios a cookie
<Ghosties> 4What a fucking relief
<Black_Latios> 2I like cookies o3o
*Black_Latios 2noms cookie
<Jerry> Subway cookies ftw
<prince-dari> Why did you want to delete it so badly?
*Damos gives Black_Latios a cookie
<Black_Latios> 2COOKIES?!]
<Black_Latios> 2fjrsgurguifhejd
*Black_Latios 2noms more cookies
<Ghosties> 4I mean, I'm not afraid to speak my mind but I sure as shit don't wanna be ostracized from the community because of some guy that everybody probably looks up to as an "inspiration"
<Ghosties> 4I have no doubt that people in Ponychan flocked to Luke Allen
<prince-dari> Don't even know who that is.
<Ghosties> 4So any kind of negative response was going to be met with immediate mudslinging
*Damos walks into the woods and noms on some of his cookies
<Hipster_Brony> 8did you read the wired article?
<Ghosties> 4I did, I read it yesterday
*Black_Latios 2chases after Damos for more cooiies
<prince-dari> I TL;DR'd it.
<Black_Latios> 2cookies*
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari, this is amazing. You are my god.
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
*Damos runs
<prince-dari> (:
*Damos hides in a cave with many halls
<Black_Latios> 2COOKIES!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!!??
<lightlugia> i read balls
*lightlugia flees
<Damos> MFAO
<Ghosties> 4Luke Allen is a 31 year old guy with Asperger's syndrome that collects MLP toys from McDonalds. And as sad as I think that sounds, I was using him as an example of how the general public will think of the rest of our community
<Damos> L*
<Revy> [03:54:54 pm] <luna> i'm gonna ask i #mIRC
<Revy> herp
*Damos hides behind a rock
<prince-dari> Ohhhh...Ouch...
<Ghosties> 4I didn't realize that he was posting in the thread, however
*Black_Latios 2lands on rock and looks down at Damos from above
<Black_Latios> 2COOKIES NAO
<Ghosties> 4Until AFTER I posted
<Damos> but...
<prince-dari> Yeah, that's unlucky.
<Damos> but...
*lightlugia tackles Black_Latios "THOSA COOKIES ARE ALL MINE! MINE TO EAT!
<Ghosties> 4And then it hit me like a ton of bricks when I realized that if he says *one thing* to me, the entirety of Ponychan would rush to his aid and swarm me with bullshit
<Ghosties> 4That's the kind of intolerance I'm talking about on Ponychan
<Black_Latios> 2NUH UH D:<
*Black_Latios 2snarls
<Ghosties> 4People wouldn't understand where I was coming from and would IMMEDIATELY call me a parasprite and shit
<Ghosties> 4Except for Max Rain, he knew what I was talking about *shrugs*
*Damos eeps at lighty coming out of nowhere
<Nick> o.o
*Nick hides
<Hipster_Brony> 8too much drama on /pony/ for me
<Hipster_Brony> 8it gets way too serious
*lightlugia growls "MINEEEEEEEEE!"
<prince-dari> ...
*lightlugia yawns and falls asleep in spot
<prince-dari> I was in the middle of typing about how I thought that ponychan was got too serious for me sometimes.
*Black_Latios 2growls, feathers sticking up all over her body in defense
*Damos tries to sneak of with his cookies down the hall
<prince-dari> -was*
*Black_Latios 2blinks
<prince-dari> People seem to want to make out as though there's some big dramatic thing happening the whole time.
*Black_Latios 2flies at jet speed towards Damos
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think part of it is The Great Pony Drought of 2011
*Damos turns around and sees Black_Latios coming towards him. eep
<Nick> (hi black latios :3)
*Damos runs
<Ghosties> 4Do you at least know where I'm coming from, Hip? I really didn't mean to insult Allen, I was just commenting on how the public probably think we're all middle aged men with Asperger's syndrome that collects MLP toys from McDonalds. I admit that I shouldn't have left the "manbaby" part in there, that was a huge mistake on my behalf.
<prince-dari> Hahaha, quite possibly.
<Black_Latios> 2hiya Nick :3
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh no, i understand and agree with you ghosties
*Black_Latios 2flies up then tackles Damos when she gets close
*Damos is tackled to the ground
<Ghosties> 4Good. I know I can be an asshole, but I do care
<Hipster_Brony> 8but like i posted in that thread about the picture of dash in the kitchen today
*Damos still hold on to the cookies
<Hipster_Brony> 8IMMEDIATE SHITSTORM
<prince-dari> I'm not really bothered about what the media says.
<Ghosties> 4Huh, I remember that thread. I lurked but I didn't read much
<Black_Latios> 2cookies pwease? o3o
<Ghosties> 4Where was the thread at, Hip?
<Ghosties> 4@dari: Bags supposedly said "who cares if the rest of the world thinks we're all pedophiles?" yesterday
*lightlugia bites Black_Latios's neck "MINE!"
<Ghosties> 4I mean, do YOU want the rest of the world to think every guy that likes MLP is a pedo?
*Damos crys
<Damos> I guess I can give you one
<Black_Latios> 2meep?
<prince-dari> I'm still not bothered, if they think I'm a paedophile for watching a TV show, then they don't deserve to talk to me. :)
*Damos gives Black_Latios a cookie
*lightlugia steal it
<lightlugia> HAH! MINE!
*Black_Latios 2squeals with joy and eats cookie, keeping a stern eye on lightlugia
*Damos gives Black_Latios another one
<prince-dari> Somehow I doubt anyone will really care anway.
*Black_Latios 2tackles lightlugia and uses Ice Beam
<Ghosties> 4I hope you're right
*lightlugia falls over but isn't affected by icebeam
<prince-dari> "Ohh, adults watching ponies, that's sad" is probably the extent of it.
*Damos trys to walk away with the rest off his cookies minus the ones he gave to them
<GUYANDSAM> how long till the pre show?
<Hipster_Brony> 8*ponyshrug*
<Hipster_Brony> 8whenever DCD gets back
<GUYANDSAM> i see lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8hopefully it will be soon though
*Damos trys to walk off into another hall
*Black_Latios 2hands a cookie to lightlugia and turns away, crossing her arms
<Charizard> http://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh235/thelugia/100_1330.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, remember how i said i was convinced the soldier was inside my head and was translating my thoughts into eloquent posts?
<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Hipster_Brony> 8he just did it again
*Damos sits and enjoys another one of his 50 cookies
<Ghosties> 4Where?
<prince-dari> He said something I don't at all agree with.
<prince-dari> "Part of my wants to blame the schooling system here. Most areas only have the option of Spanish or French and don't begin teaching them until Middle School. I didn't begin Spanish classes until 7th grade, or in other words, until I was 13. A 13 year old's mind is not able to perceive new languages well."
<prince-dari> Wut
<prince-dari> You can't learn a new language well at 13?
*lightlugia stuffs it in Black_Latios's beak
<Black_Latios> 2O-o
<prince-dari> You can learn a new language at any age. :/
*Damos runs of into a secret room
<Damos> I hope i CAN HIDE THESE COOKIES
*Black_Latios 2sits there confused
<Nick> a wild charizard entered!
*Nick throws masterball at it!
<prince-dari> You can learn a new language better at 25 than you can at 13.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ghosties, in that thread i made
<Ghosties> 4Ah, yeah, I just saw his post
*Damos eats another one of his cookies
<prince-dari> If you're learning a new language at 25 it's because you want to, and you will put effort in, at 13 you most likely aren't bothered at all and will put no effort in.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think he was talking about as compared to young children, which is true
<Ghosties> 4Oh, did some shameless plugging for a "what are you doing?" thread on /oat/ :D
<Sionx> mfw I began learning english at ~10 yo
*Damos gives Black_Latios and Lighty another cookie
<Damos> I like you guys
<prince-dari> You can learn a new language easily if you grow up with it, sure, but that's REALLY young, you probably wouldn't ever remember learning it.
*Black_Latios 2smirks and noms cookie
<prince-dari> At 7 you wouldn't learn it better than at 13.
*lightlugia takes his and stuffs in in Black_Latios's beak :#
<prince-dari> Other than if you had reached the point at 13 where you couldn't be bothered to learn it.
<Ghosties> 4Dari, I tried taking Spanish in the tenth grade and then Spanish 2 in the 11th grade.
<Ghosties> 4I barely remember any Spanish at all : /
<Hipster_Brony> 8i took spanish every year starting in 6th grade
<Hipster_Brony> 8still not particularly good at it
<Ghosties> 4I'm sure you're better at Spanish than I am :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8hell, my roommate is majoring in spanish, has been taking it for 3 years at an advanced university level and lived in spain for a few months, and he still isnt fluent
<prince-dari> My uncle took French when he was 13.
<prince-dari> He didn't put much effort into it and wasn't very good.
<Hipster_Brony> 8but my 6 year old brother, since they taught spanish at his pre-school when he was a toddler, can speak spanish better than i can
<prince-dari> When he was older he paid for lessons, and is fluent.
<Valdien> mfw I used the wrong name.
<prince-dari> Age has nothing to do with it.
<Ghosties> 4I dunno, Dari. I've heard through psychology that your brain absorbs information better at a younger age, thus making learning another language much easier than trying to learn it later in life
<Bronypeanut> OHAI
<Ghosties> 4Hello, Peanut
<Hipster_Brony> 8o hai peanut
<prince-dari> At a younger age than most school starts.
<Bronypeanut> 13Hows it goin everypony
<Ghosties> 4Alright, I suppose
<Black_Latios> 2bbl
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari, studies have shown that young children learn languages more easily than older people
<prince-dari> I've seen studies that suggest the opposite.
<Combustiblelemons> hows it going everyone?
<Bronypeanut> 13When does the uh
<Armads> I'm kinda surprised that quit message is still getting used. lol
<Ghosties> 4I HATE YOU, COMBUSTIBLELEMONS
<prince-dari> At a younger age you put little to no effort in and I know NO ONE who has become fluent from taking a lanugage at shcol these past 6 years.
<Bronypeanut> 13Er. Nvm.
<Ghosties> 4Nah, I'm just fucking with ya
<Combustiblelemons> D: Y U NO LIKE ME D:
<Combustiblelemons> oh lol
<Ghosties> 4I hate everybody
<Ghosties> 4*shrugs*
<prince-dari> They tested how much 25 year old people learnt, against how much 13 year olds learnt, the 25 year old people raped the 13 year old kids.
<Combustiblelemons> ghosties is secretly francis from l4d
*Damos walks down the hallway with his cookies
<Hipster_Brony> 8im talking younger though
<Ghosties> 4I bet you'd like that, wouldn't you lemon?
<Hipster_Brony> 8like 4 year olds versus 14 year olds
<Combustiblelemons> Rochelle would
<prince-dari> Lol, if you could get the 14 year olds to put in any effort they'd do better.
<Ghosties> 4Nobody likes Rochelle
<prince-dari> I could go and learn a whole French dictionary in a week.
<Ghosties> 4Nobody
<prince-dari> But I'm too lazy to invest the time.
<Bronypeanut> So uh
<Bronypeanut> Hai
<prince-dari> A 4 year old couldn't do that.
<Combustiblelemons> I don't thats for certain
<Combustiblelemons> Why did bill have to die D:
<Ghosties> Glad you could find us, lol

<Ghosties> 4My favorite character was Zoey, anyways

<Bronypeanut> I know how to get around

<Damos> better
<Ghosties> 4I was just about to say, haha
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari, that post basically described me in high school
<Ghosties> 4Well, I suppose I'm glad that somebody likes me
<Combustiblelemons> aww :(
<prince-dari> Lawl, Ghosties, don't pretend we don't all love you.
<Combustiblelemons> Us bronies gotta stick together
<Combustiblelemons> we all love you ^_^
<Ghosties> 4I have some pretty unpopular opinions on Ponychan
<Hipster_Brony> 8at the risk of sounding like an arrogant dick, i am very smart, but i put in 0 work in high school because it was pointless and boring to me
<Ghosties> 4Hipster's such an arrogant dick
<Angel_Espy|Drawing> 13I used to have that song
<Combustiblelemons> ^agreed ^^ lol
<Bronypeanut> <3
<prince-dari> People in my family tend to get good results at school, but we put in pretty much no effort other than for the final tests that actually matter.
<Apokalipse> ooh. People are already here
<Combustiblelemons> meh i think having a fun life is more important than school
<Hipster_Brony> 8having homework assignments where you match people to the dates they were born is not productive to me
<Hipster_Brony> 8and yet, that's what most of high school was
<Hipster_Brony> 8and word searchees
<prince-dari> I got pretty good at avoiding all the punishment, hahaha.
<Hipster_Brony> 8searches*
<prince-dari> Tell them I handed in my homework, make them think they lost the book.
<Ghosties> 4@Apokalipse: Yeah, we should be getting started fairly soon. The actual BMN will begin at 7

<Elky> yep, it comes dangerously close to trolling
<Combustiblelemons> if people waste their time trolling us though i find that sad
<Skylands> 10Nevermind, I figured it out
<Combustiblelemons> so why should bronies do it back?
<Beat> Well at least when I started this Epic Rap Battle business, it was on accident.
<Skylands> 10On the right of your deviation page, it says "Submit to Group"
<Espeon> 06And Sky LOL at that pic, somehow it fits better than expected.
<Hipster_Brony> 8DCD, so much hate
<Combustiblelemons> our way is tolerance not fighting fire with fire :/
<Hipster_Brony> 8whats happening?
<MobileDCD> HATE HATE HATE when my mom gets a weekday off
<MobileDCD> She siphons all my time with her errands
<MobileDCD> Not home yet and it's almost an hour and half to showtime!

<prince-dari> From your computer.
<Combustiblelemons> lots of releases for games :D
<prince-dari> November is good because it's closer to ponies.
<Beat> @Combustiblelemons I just had a mental picture of Obama standing outside the queens window holding a stereo playing some love song from the 90's.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep, especially since they rearranged the place so all the outlets are RIGHT NEXT to the singer.
<mariomarc> hi guys
<SirSprinkles> 6I could reach out and touch the guitars from here.
<Combustiblelemons> Beat, i think that may happen one day

<SirSprinkles> 6...I really want to see that...
<Elky> nooo, that means a smaller chance for me
<Combustiblelemons> we need a bit of entertainment here I think :/
<prince-dari> Don't accept when you don't know what they do. XD Sort of, they could use the command to do pretty much anything.
<Combustiblelemons> well? D:
<luna> lmao
<prince-dari> Like make me post my IP address and stuff.
<Elky> uh...
<luna> why didnt you just unload the script, lol.

<Curt> Also I'm probably the only person here who LIKES the Mario movie
<MrBubbles> Never seen it
<NickOnimura> No, you're not the only one.

<BronzeClock> I expected to see a movie. not ace attorney
<mib_80hmv1> what if they make a halo movie?
<Combustiblelemons> nope greyfire
<Axel_Foaley> That movie was too gloomy for my interests as a kid.
<prince-dari> Maybe put today's lineup in the channel topic?
<Combustiblelemons> DON'T. EVEN. SAY THAT. MLP.
<mib_womx5c> yay, I can see
<mib_womx5c> FOREVER
<Curt> I consider it an unironicly good film
<Rurik> Halo already sucks, so the worst case scenario the movie sucks just as badly.
<mib_80hmv1> you suck
<mib_80hmv1> >.>
<Combustiblelemons> Metal gear solid 4 is practically a movie
<NickOnimura> People don't get murdered over simple games?

<wires> there are stories about people getting killed over anything
<Silverscreen> 11Wazzup?
<Combustiblelemons> they're tying up all the questions we had from mgs2
<Obscure> About half a dozen times in the past decade have people been in the news, being killed for games.
<Wolf-man> Hey Silverscreen
<mib_80hmv1> final fantasy is a movie by itself
<Combustiblelemons> they did it well I say

<Obscure> If the bottle smashes the force will be dramatically reduced.
<SirSprinkles> 6Orly?

<Axel_Foaley> Orly Tates
<Beat> @Pungrongo Dash, Fluttershy, Dash, Fluttershy DEAE LORD I SUCK WITH DECISCIONS

<Combustiblelemons> Rainbow dash/fluttershy are best. no questioning it.
<Ghosties> Furthermore, if we were doing a pre-show, would people still have to post their suggestions in the discussion thread on /chat/?
<BronzeClock> fluttershy is so cute
<Pungrongo> Eyup.
<Rurik> Women watching My Little Pony? Preposterous! Ponies are for the manliest of manly men type men! Women watch girly gunk like wrestling and football.
<Rope> Shocking!
<MrBubbles> Fluttershy, Raindbow Dash, Applejack, in that order
<macbrony> orly miss orly?
<Pungrongo> OH REALLY, MS. ORLY?!

<ArceusShaymin> Pinkamena (crazy Pinkie), Trixie, and Twilight in that order
<Hipster_Brony> also, in the future, im just gonna have people do it on the /oat/ thread

<Rurik> Applejack? Silly, that's not how you spell Pinkie Pie.
<GreyFire> Derpy is the best pony
<Ghosties> I just hope it won't be pushing our luck
<GobLAN> THERE IS NO LOCKET ON HIM
<Illusion> There's no locket!
<LolziLexicorn> is this a video or live gameplay?

<DeevFactor> Yep, it's all true.
<Draconaes> DUN DUN DUNNN
<MrBubbles> Fluttershy
<NickOnimura> I honestly can't decide. I like them all.
<Chessie2003> Spike is best dragon
<Saph> inorite
<Pungrongo> Luna is best royalty
<Combustiblelemons> Anyone had a pony dream yet?
<desertman2> You know you're correct when the music stops.
<Pungrongo> Not yet
<mib_womx5c> Trixie is best Trixie
<Ayralynn> The butler did it

<frostedWarlock> :?
<Pungrongo> I had a GTA IV dream the other night
<prince-dari> I haven't remembered a dream in years.
<LolziLexicorn> so sweet and tasty
<mib_80hmv1> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<Pungrongo> That would have been fun, had ponies gotten involved
<LolziLexicorn> dont be too hasty :D
<Ghosties> 4I dreamed Fluttershy was playing the Wii last night
<MrBubbles> Fluttershy saved me from a dragon

<prince-dari> Skyrim on wii?
<UncleOrange> I had to go on a trip, and Rarity offered to make me a suit
<prince-dari> O__o
<GreyFire> On the Wii?
<Scorch_Mechanic> Oh, it's this case.
<Rurik> This fandom is severely lacking in Apple Pie shipping, clearly Apple Pie is the superior ship as apple pies are tasty.
<mib_80hmv1> wii suuuucks
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, haha
<Rope> wait, that guy's phoenix isn't he
<Saph> wii uuu wii uuu
<ArceusShaymin> I had a dream of "Cupckakes"
<Rope> i forgot about that
<Ghosties> 4It is a DREAM after all, right
<Ghosties> 4?
<Arcesious> I had a dream that I was rainbow dash
<Combustiblelemons> I had another dream that was strangely like a full episode
<Pungrongo> I can only ever remember the dreams I have after I've already woken up, and I've dozed off again in bed
<Frame_Rate_Pony> Yeah I thought this was Pheonix Wright, I'm confused
<brigh> Mmmm apple pies
<Illusion> Yes, that's Phoenix. Defense attorney gone defendant.
<lyrabon> cool story bro
<Saph> sounds more like an ambulance than a game system
<Fengor> If she's Ms. Orly where's Mr. Yarly
<UncleOrange> Skyrim on Wii U would be epic
<Arcesious> and a dream where I met Twilight Sparkle in RL
<Combustiblelemons> Rainbow Dash breaks her leg after failing to do a trick
<Ghosties> 4There's no way Skyrim would ever be ported over to the Wii
<Scorch_Mechanic> This is Ace Attourney, yes.
<Pungrongo> Unfortunately, they only ever happen on weekdays
<Hipster_Brony> i dont think so, derpy was the only one who ever objected to it, and he said he wont move it unless it gets reported
<Axel_Foaley> Wii U. Now I play videogames while I play videogames.
<Ghosties> 4...maybe the Wii U
<fredfred99> why is Apollo Justice playing?
<Scorch_Mechanic> And Phoenix Wright is in here.
<Brownd> when I had mine I automatically went and posted it on PonyChan before I could forget it
<SirSprinkles> 6Is this girl like, 5?
<Illusion> It's just the Apollo Justice line
<Ghosties> Alright
<superblah12> 0In this game, phoenix ain't a lawyer anymore cuz he did something wrong. Can't remember what tho.
<Scorch_Mechanic> I haven't finished this game.
<Pungrongo> had a daughter?
<Brownd> spoilers lol
<Scorch_Mechanic> I got a lot farther than this though.
<prince-dari> Lol, methinks.
<UncleOrange> Because Miles Edgeworth can be kind of a troll

<GreyFire> But now he has an awesome beanie to make up for it.

<Dermathil> wait, when are the movies starting?
<Scorch_Mechanic> If that.

<Hipster_Brony> ok dealing with these in order
<Lambda> have you guys heard of the game Mod Nation Racers?
<mib_80hmv1> OBJELADCTION
<Meanwhile> Besides, what would the cutie mark of a pony who's talent was being ridiculous even look like?
<Scorch_Mechanic> CORRECTION
<lyrabon> ARCEUS IS A GOD!
<Hipster_Brony> dari, we'll make one for next week
<superblah12> 0Can't wait for Layton vs wright. Even if i can't understand anything!
<Wolf-man> So is it safe to say that Mario should start around 7:30?
<Moonglow> Oh jeez, now i have to play this game
<Mikey> no
<mib_womx5c> Wright's boyfriend dumped him
<Lambda> think mario kart
<Killsteal_Wolf> Now boys and girls, who implied who was using Blue Cards?
<LolziLexicorn> the defendants defending himself
<Mikey> never played mario kart
<Lambda> except you can completely customize everything
<prince-dari> Is someone making a pony version?
<Saph> Obama
<Hipster_Brony> ghosties, they can post links until the stream starts, you might want to let him know ahead of time tho
<prince-dari> I think I heard about it.
<Lambda> no, but close
<mib_80hmv1> blue is just a darker shade of red
<Rainbow_Dash> 0So thats where i have seen that guy before (Phoenix)
<ArceusShaymin> OBAMA
<Moonglow> He looks so.... laid back
<Arcesious> where can i get this game
<UncleOrange> What wwould Payne's cutie mark be?
<Scorch_Mechanic> He who has himself for a lawyer has a fool for a client.
<Jood> I like how Phoenix as the witness goes around trolling his defendant
<Lambda> that was our first game we got for our PS3
<Bronypeanut> 13 12 minutes everypony
<Lambda> and my first character I made was Pinkie
<Bronypeanut> 13=D
<LolziLexicorn> during
<Lambda> I think it turned out
<mariomarc> is this the same phoenix?
<Brownd> *yaaaaaay*
<Hipster_Brony> bristle, DCD is playing it to kill time before the stream starts
<Elky> after!
<Klonoa79H> What would Aphex Twins cutie mark be like as werid as his music

<GabeMoist> We need a Payne pony
<OnionBubs> Hmm...am I actually here now? *unsure how this thing works*
<prince-dari> I want the blind bag ponies.
<Lambda> I'll get a screenshot and show you guys
<Scorch_Mechanic> This is the same Phoenix, but older.
<Saph> BUT TWELVE BACKWWARDS IS 35
<Pungrongo> Blue is just red, a little further up the spectrum.
<mariomarc> cool
<prince-dari> But apparently they're only made in Germany. :/
<Jood> and whoo, brony movies are midnight. Silly timezones
<Meanwhile> Objection i have bird hair!
<Brownd> SILLY > IMPOSSIBLE

<Lambda> what do you need it for?
<LolziLexicorn> Olga Orly?
<Pungrongo> I am also form the UK.
<Jood> I am fine with this. Many UK ponies
<Meanwhile> Rainbows and magnets
<Scorch_Mechanic> I don't think this case will conclude by the time the movies will start.
<Rurik> Pft, we should do away with timezones and all run on the same clock.
<prince-dari> Lol, this chat is TQ;DR (my coinage of just now).
<Ghosties> Oh, and I sent a PM to lyrabon to stop posting links when the show starts
<Nick> critically anyway
<Arcesious> i never really understood timezones either *shrugs*
<desertman2> It's 3:50 here'
<CartoonFreak95> I is from the UK, xD
<Aponymous> Her names Orly? Mind=Blown
<OnionBubs> Doing away with time zones would make no sense!
<Moonglow> West Coast
<Saph> Orly?
<mlprandom> 6:51
<Jood> Getting rid of timezones would be nice, but Celestia's sun doesn't allow it
<GreyFire> I isn't from the UK
<MisterBristle> But he looks like a crazy hipster/jogger/rapper dude, what is wrong with him!
<Lambda> let me just upload it again
<mib_80hmv1> and im from texas, i say we need to seceed again
<Searyx> Hello, everypony!
<CartoonFreak95> Yup!
<UncleOrange> The world isn't flat, Equestria on the other hand is
<OnionBubs> You'd have people waking up at midnight because the sun would be rising.
<Scorch_Mechanic> I didn't understand timezones until I had to learn them to wrangle out scheduling conflicts for TF2 highlander stuff.
<LolziLexicorn> heh
<mib_womx5c> heh
<Hipster_Brony> might want to warn publicly next time, so everypony can see it
<Elky> EHEHEHEH

<lyrabon> Pinkie pie is hilarious in this episode
<Scorch_Mechanic> Jood: Eeyup.
<Meanwhile> a new direction
<Illusion> I don't have a preference. I love the sun and moon equally.
<mib_80hmv1> luuunnnaaaaa

<Elky> argon>neon
<Lambda> would you like emokarp or my badass mudkip as well?
<Jood> Luna is pleased with these brit ponies watching films at midnight

<superblah12> 0pony>9000
<Elky> it is?
<Hipster_Brony> 8 9 minutes until the movie
<mib_womx5c> I DON'T GET IT ANY MORE
<mib_80hmv1> luna should banish trollestia to the sun
<Jood> Phoenix Wright logic
<UncleOrange> Is there a we need an offical pony steam group
<Scorch_Mechanic> We have one.
<Armlec> what movie are we watching?
<GreyFire> It seems that the Chat and Video only work if I'm typing or moving the mouse. Any ideas why?
<Bronypeanut> 13check

<OnionBubs> I have no idea how this place works... :/
<prince-dari> Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

<Scorch_Mechanic> THIS EVIDENCE CLEARLY INDICATES SOMETHING ELSE
<Beat> Recess? IMMA PLAY ON THE SWINGS
<OnionBubs> I never saw Black RX.
<DissonantNight> Is there a time when next weeks selections will be made?
<Illusion> Gravity-defying hair is a logical objection to everything.
<Saph> I told you bro
<OnionBubs> But Hibiki is my favorite Kamen Rider.
<NewDCD> 9KAMEN RIDER
<Darf14> I remember why I didn't like the story on this game that much. It doesn't really flesh out Apolo as an important character very much, but its still fun.
<OnionBubs> I know, I'm weird.
<NewDCD> 9KUROI BODY
<Tigerflame> 4Hi ya'll~

<OnionBubs> Everyone seems to hate Go-Onger.
<Moonglow> So... is Maya in this one?
<Lambda> with the other two pokemon edits I've done
<Illusion> Giga Drill Breaker?
<fredfred99> slide ftw
<SirSprinkles> 6Mine is the drill that pierces Objections?
<Scorch_Mechanic> I'M CALLING OUT TO SCATMAN'S WORLD
<Killsteal_Wolf> Problem with Apollo Justice is Phoenix just steals the Main Character slot at critical moments in the game.
<Lambda> http://imgur.com/a/w6Vpl
<Combustiblelemons> I WILL BE THE ONE TO PIERCE THE HEAVENS!
<Jood> Nice

<SnideMollusk> Gotta say, the music is quite nice
