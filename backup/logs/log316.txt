<Cy`> America won't pass SOPA. Obama has already said he won't let it through..
<Kammerjunk> With Denmark being very free land, I strongly hope my government won't sign it.
<otakon> Fleur: the US already signed it, but'll have no power if the EU signing fails
<Saturn> 8,1germany already has strict sopa-type laws though
<ofna01> 6_9
<Lulu> 07,01^
<ofna01> 6_9
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Saturn: Not too harshly though
<otakon> ther worst part is
*ofna01 turns into fluttershy
<Kammerjunk> So they would have the whole world become China.
<Fleur> Cy` we are talkinga bout ACTA not SOPA... ACTA can be global
<otakon> this video is two years old
<Kammerjunk> So much for the Information Age.
<DerpyHooves`> 08,146.9
<ofna01> ALRIGHT
<ofna01> TURN THIS OFF
<Saturn> 8,1DerpyHooves`: i have friends who have been served for downloading a single illegal file on bittorrent
<ofna01> WE NEED PONIES
*Globetrotter squees at ofna01 turning into fluttershy
<Saturn> 8,1which is why one should always use encryption
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Saturn: I know this. . .
<otakon> ofna01: take it easy with the allcaps
<Sumica> 00,10I have feeling that many ISP's will fight this tooth and nail just because of how expensive it would be to set up
*ofna01 yaaay
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Saturn: EXACTLY
<RawketLawnchair> Oh hey there DerpyHooves`
<otakon> what IS that song however?
<ofna01> 6_9
<Cy`> Either way, it won't pass thoughout the world. It'll cause mass revolution in too many countries.
<StickySyrup> its like a cyber dark brotherhood
<Fleur> They never see mass revolution coming silly.
<Kammerjunk> Every day it seems the sky is getting darker, and every night the stars seem dimmer than before. "What a world," I said, "where trademarks run the people." In the end, none of it matters anymore.
<ofna01> D:
<Kammerjunk> What happened to our morals and ideals, which we paraded on our banners and our screeds?
<Globetrotter> Break off, make new country
<Globetrotter> Internet is free.
<ofna01> still exists kammer
<ofna01> just less
<Fleur> they are too dumb to realize that people will push back that hard
<Kammerjunk> What were we fighting for in distant land on distant shore?
<otakon> indeed
<Ictiv> It's not even less
<Kammerjunk> Great.
<Ictiv> It is there
<ArcherJoe11> We will found Equestria somewhere
<Lulu> 07,01if this happends.. the internet is FAR from FREE
<otakon> if it's worth it, it's worth fighting for!
<Saturn> 8,1i declare that January 18th should be International Internet Superiority Day
<Kammerjunk> Now I've got THAT stuck in my head.
<otakon> we can't lose hope!
<Ictiv> Just not with the people who ca do most
<ofna01> the world is just as big,there's just less in it
<otakon> that's what they want! Us to give up!
<otakon> never I say!
<Saturn> 8,1we should mark January 18th next year as some kind of celebration/holiday/awareness day
<Sumica> 00,10but it's the 24th
<Saturn> 8,1Sumica: i mean for next year
<Globetrotter> So?
<Ictiv> Sumica: 18th was a blackout day
<Fleur> lol
<otakon> I will go William Wallace in DC if I have to!
<ArcherJoe11> I just met all of you. If they manage that, then Bronystate may be at it's end
<otakon> yes
<Saturn> 8,1ArcherJoe11: it'll never pass
<Kammerjunk> Well, all this SOPA and ACTA talk has gotten me in a bad mood, so I'm going to listen to some depressing music and read some fanfics.
<Fleur> otakon: I will be right beside you! *puts on war paint*
<Kammerjunk> Have fun.
<otakon> hell yeah!
<ofna01> if only we could go to celestia
<otakon> Kilts and facepaint for ALL!
<Kammerjunk> Dat Pink Floyd.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah that black out was silly imo, much like the dont buy gas days they tryed to protest fuel cost
<Globetrotter> kammerjunk, listen to some van Canto
<Kammerjunk> I already had something in mind, actually.
*Fleur lifts her flamburg off of the wall and yells some indistinguishable grunt
<Kammerjunk|Reading> Valê.
<prince-dari> Sumica: It wasn't in any way silly, wikipedia shutting down for a day gave MASS exposure.
<otakon> Kammerjunk: don't despair! Have hope! HAVE FAITH! We the people of the internet will NOT stand for this
<Ictiv> freaking out th teacher infront of class... good idea
<ofna01> turn this off
<prince-dari> Millions of people that had no idea about it before would have found out
<Ictiv> They'll ahve a lot of respect for here later
<otakon> Wikipedia needs to black out against this
<Fleur> Google and Wiki did a good job
<ofna01> google did
<Arentius> The sad thing is there were millions more who still didn't understand why Wikipedia was down
<Globetrotter> I could still get around the wiki blacjout
<otakon> has anyone emailed Wikipedia about ACTA?
<tvoie> and those that did know about it knew how to get past the filter!
<Saturn> 8,1i have myskinsoft pony remover stuck in my head
<arrowtobroknee> Facebook should go down for 24 hours
<ofna01> saturn
<ofna01> wats that
<Sumica> 00,10except they did't realy bring any thing down, they just ran scrips to make it look like it was down.
<Arentius> tvoie, wikipedia themeselves told you how to bypass the blackout if you bothered to read the page
<Ictiv> arrowtobroknee: The moment facebook goes down, facebook is dead

<Kammerjunk> SuperBrony64: I might have, depending on how you'll take it.
<LadyCanary> It's what I get from growing up around a disco, soul, and Beatles loving mother and classic rock/jazz loving father.
<Globetrotter> Kammerjunk: I'll take it with a side of chips
<Saturn> 8,1you know what's good with chips?

<Saturn> 8,1indeed.
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: It's always lupus... Except an advanced intelligent version of lupus. It play tricks on the docotros, watching their reactions an playing with them in a game of shadows where he's challanging them to find out its mortal riddle, only allowing the paitent to liveonce its enemies - the doctors - have reached the end of its infernal maze...

<Ictiv> two days of school? good schedule
<Globetrotter> Fav type of pony, GO!
<Dashie_Dashie> Pegasus aka FLUTTERSHY.
<Ictiv> Globetrotter: Equestrian
<ekips> alicorn of course
<Globetrotter> That was implied ictiv...:P
<Kammerjunk> I would pay my soul to be a pegasus.
<Kammerjunk> Seriously.
<Kammerjunk> And I don't even believe in souls!
<Ictiv> Globetrotter: The fact that I don't play favourites was also implied ;)
<Globetrotter> :D
<Dashie_Dashie> Fluttershy has my heart.
<KetaminaDianePie> and my sword
<Kammerjunk> To be fair, Twilight is my favourite pony, but I would prefer to be a pegasus of the three.
<Dashie_Dashie> and MY AXeE.
<Globetrotter> AXeE?
<Dashie_Dashie> I thought I backspaced that -_-
<Globetrotter> xD
<Kammerjunk> Thanks for the hint, House.
<Ictiv> "Lets us cut into her head with no good reason" Conclusion: Her brain is dead. Stitch that up and off to the morgue
<DashWithRainbows> hey kirzstryfe.
<Dashie_Dashie> Looks like she...
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, kirzstryfe.

<otakon> hi kirzstryfe
<Shizuka> 13afternoon kirz
<Ictiv> Baby cry is annoying? How silly... Does this mean tha House was born to be a dad?
<Kammerjunk> Evenin'.
<Globetrotter> I will cut you Dashie_Dashie
<Dashie_Dashie> :>
<Shizuka> 13though with how late i wake up i may as well figure out what timezone i live by and say morning
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: To be fair, I don't have a hard time cutting the sound off.
<kirzstryfe> 11,14if you don't like my colors, PM me with a scheme you won't confuse with any other mod :p
<Ictiv> Speaking to a baby... Who needs her brain checked out agaiN

<Dashie_Dashie> baby*

<Globetrotter> baby?
<Kammerjunk> See, every single conclusion in this show is reached via fantastic coincidences.
<Midnight_Tempest> glomps!! *glomps everyone*
<Randomnerd> Hallo
*Dashie_Dashie glomps back
<Globetrotter> ...
<Globetrotter> Glomp?
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: Me too but it is a generaly accepted thought that baby cry is annoying. When the woman with her head open finds it annoying, it shouldn't be the big sign that something isn't right
<Kammerjunk> Globetrotter: Yes. It's a word.
<Globetrotter> ...
<Globetrotter> What?
<Randomnerd> hrm.
<Kammerjunk> Globetrotter: It's a bit like huggles, only sounds funnier.
<Ictiv> Globetrotter: Glomp is a word
<Midnight_Tempest> its the same as being tackle hugged
<Globetrotter> "NOT sexual, it is the action of one person lovingly (and dramatically) attacking another with a hug."
<Globetrotter> Like a rugby tackle?
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: Actualyl glomp sounds like when a baby with no teeth bites on your finger
<tvoie> like sneaky snuggle attack
<Sundaysmile> baby looks stoned
<Globetrotter> Ahh, my friend ninja hugged me once in the hall
<Globetrotter> So I picked him up and walked into a wall.
<Globetrotter> It was an interesting day.
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: That's a strange comparison.
<Kammerjunk> But true.
<Kammerjunk> Globetrotter: wat
<kirzstryfe> 11,14:)
<Midnight_Tempest> oh man... Steven_Magnet is still here...
<Kammerjunk> Yes, he is.

<Kammerjunk> I don't get the hate I see against Twist.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14good afternoon everyone
<Kammerjunk> It's not like she didn't want to be Applejack's friend after she got her cutie mark.
<kirzstryfe> 11,14Lulu, why are you hating on the dragons? :p

<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, ScootaChicken.
<Randomnerd> KammerJunk, so how many eggs are in a container?
<Sundaysmile> you missed a good one
<Kammerjunk> Randomnerd: 10.
<Sundaysmile> if it's the eggs from my local. 3 good ones the rest smashed.
<tvoie> i get my eggs 8 at a time
<Randomnerd> Kammerjunk: Metric -makes enough sense.
<Kammerjunk> Eeyup.
<Randomnerd> In the states, you can get them in multiples of six.
<Kammerjunk> Aha.
<Sundaysmile> same here
<Sundaysmile> as well as batches of 10
<Randomnerd> Half Dozen, Dozen, 18.
<tvoie> but...i can never get them in 6
<Sundaysmile> or 24....
<tvoie> ever
<Kammerjunk> I don't like 6.
<Kammerjunk> It's a silly number.
<Randomnerd> tvoie: Usually the fancy eggs will come half-a-dozen.
<Kammerjunk> "Hellevator's broken"?
<tvoie> i don't have fancy eggs
<Randomnerd> tvoie: They're not really worth it.
<Kammerjunk> Has any of you ever had strawberry pie?
<Kammerjunk> Real, home baked strawberry pie?
<Randomnerd> Eeyup
<Sundaysmile> no just strawberry tart
<tvoie> they all come out of a chicken, so i don't think there's any difference
<Sundaysmile> with clotted cream
<Kammerjunk> Because it's not the same if you buy it from the baker.
*DerpyHooves` meows
<ekips> that sounds like my life ~.~
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, uh... Fluttershy`?
<Randomnerd> Hi Vi
<Kammerjunk> I'm not sure.

<Kammerjunk> See you in a jiffy, then.
<Randomnerd> kk
<Kammerjunk> Why does everybody in TV shows have Macbooks?
<Sundaysmile> because sponsorship
<ekips> moneee
<Midnight_Tempest> souls
<Ictiv> DerpyHooves`: You made me thing you were discussing a movie by its IMBD score 6_9
<Sundaysmile> and souls... yes
<Kammerjunk> ekips: We got to have MONEEEEEEH
<ekips> We require more moneey

<Globetrotter> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet

<Globetrotter> Must have the MONEEEET!
<Midnight_Tempest> We require more vespine gas
<Kammerjunk> Globetrotter: oh u
<Randomnerd> Sponsorship -Product placement. Awesome people have macs, and in order to be awesome, you should buy a mac too.
<Randomnerd> Make more mans.
<Kammerjunk> I have an HP laptop and an Android.
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14lol
<tvoie> i'm a pc...
<Randomnerd> As am I.
<Kammerjunk> I'm feeling fine on the OS I want to use.
<Globetrotter> Kammerjunk oh u, u so silly
<MidnightBolt> I am a man and a PC
<MirrorImage> i'm quite content on my 6 year old Dell XP Laptop thank you.
<MidnightBolt> moc*
<Randomnerd> Because I use Ubuntu anyway, and I'm not paying treble the price for hardware.
<MidnightBolt> Mac*
<MirrorImage> scratch that - 4 year old laptop
<tvoie> oh yeah, phase4 convinced me to run ubuntu
<Kammerjunk> Randomnerd: Exactly.
<Kammerjunk> tvoie: How are you finding it?
<tvoie> internet
<RawketLawnchair> Alright, now I'm back.
<RawketLawnchair> Hey there, everone.
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14ubuntu, the OS for people that want to seem smart X3
<Randomnerd> I'm not a programmer or anything, so i don't need anything sophisticated.
<Kammerjunk> No, I mean how do you think it is so far?
<RawketLawnchair> Everyone, even. Also, hey there DerpyHooves`
<RawketLawnchair> How are you doing?
<Randomnerd> DerpyHooves` I'm not smart, I'm cheap.
<Midnight_Tempest> laggy stream
<Kammerjunk> Randomnerd: This is just my laptop, anyway. All my games and stuff are on my desktop.
<Kammerjunk> jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
<Kammerjunk> Whoops.
<Kammerjunk> Sorry.
<Kammerjunk> I was resting my hands.
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14RawketLawnchair: Doing well~
<Randomnerd> kay
<Kammerjunk> And then I wanted to press backspace, but pressed enter instead.
<Kammerjunk> Confound this laptop keyboard.
<RawketLawnchair> That's good, that's good. How's the weather over there?
<MirrorImage> Kammerjunk: that's why i went out and bought a separate keybaord for my laptop
<tvoie> inb4 she codes
<Kammerjunk> MirrorImage: Easier to travel without, though.
<MirrorImage> laptop keyboard works good when on the go, certainly
<MirrorImage> but my laptop is more of a desk computer anyways
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<RawketLawnchair> I like the color scheme there, by the way, DerpyHooves`
<Kammerjunk> I have my desktop at home, but right now, I'm living in the middle of nowhere because leakages.
<MirrorImage> which is why having a laptop as a desktop makes for a decent compromise
<MirrorImage> MUCH easier to move
<tvoie> i have a laptop on life support
<MirrorImage> yes... computers on life support are always fun...
<MirrorImage> i had a Windows 98 laptop on life support up until about 2005
<MirrorImage> and my dad's XP machine from 2002 only just now started crapping itself
<Kammerjunk> I moved to Windows Vista before everyone realised it was baaaad.
<Kammerjunk> So I moved to Windows 7 the moment I could.
<tvoie> it has no battery, even if it did, the charger doesn't carge, and the cord will fall out if it's at any angle and not strapped down
<MirrorImage> when i get a job and have the money to buy a proper gaming rig, that's probably what i'll end up doing as well
<prince-dari> LEVERAGE

<Kammerjunk> MirrorImage: If you build it yourself, it's so much cheaper.
<Dashie_Dashie> Epic lunar pic from EQD is epic.
<Dashie_Dashie> Luna*
<MirrorImage> perhaps, but then i have to worry about making sure that everything works with everything else
<MirrorImage> i have the money to spare to waste on a prebuilt rig
<Kammerjunk> You can get a pre-built gaming rig here for 14000 DKK, but it costed me 8000 DKK to build it yourself.
<Kammerjunk> myself*
<MirrorImage> and from there, i can do piecemeal upgrades along the way - extra stick of memory here, new graphics card there, etc etc

<pony_3066> I'd rather not have a violent revolution.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<Shizuka> 13dat cg
<Nyria> Woah, nice text kirzstryfe ~
<pony_3066> Velvet revolution
<pony_3066> No, an aerogel revolutiob
<pony_3066> *revolution
<pony_3066> (If you get this reference, you win)
<ekips1> Cy`: my city is full of "anti-government" guys, every wall is full of propaganda
<MidnightBolt> Vermin Supreme 2012
<Nyria> Viva La Vida~
<Cy`> I violent revolution will incur sadly. Human instict is a violent instinct
<Shizuka> 13such a... caring... doctor .-.
<derpy_pony> do we have any people who are crazy enough to kill politicians? can't see any. all this ddos stuff is kindergarten
<pony_3066> Again. I've heard of serious stuff going off in America, and I know that serious stuff is going off in the UK
<Cy`> A*
<tvoie> i know about basic poisons and such
<pony_3066> For example: Censored newspapers.
<Kammerjunk> Cy`: In the end, the human condition will be our downfall.
<Nyria> Praise jesus?~
<Cy`> tvoie: I know more than just basic ones<3
<tvoie> i'm not any kind of assasin though
<Starflash> Holy-
<derpy_pony> protip...don't play with explosives
<ekips1> Cy`: i don't like to be in the middle of the action, rather be a background support
<Kammerjunk> derpy_pony: You don't say?
<Cy`> Kammerjunk: Oh of course. And the human condition is Power Control.
<derpy_pony> it's not the three facts you know about them that kill you
<derpy_pony> it's the stuff you don't know
<tvoie> it's everything you don't?
<pony_3066> Martial arts training, good with an air rifle, good with knives, good with nunchucks, and various other weapons, still don't wanna kill anyone. I'd like to think that the society we'd bring about would be one that could mostly avoid things like that. Using wits / whatever. We DO live in the information age.
<Cy`> But, even though I'm am an Anarchist. I am not Anti-Goverment. I am Anti-Current-Goverment.
<Sundaysmile> Humidity, temperature, reaction and friction. That's all you need to be careful for.
<tvoie> and fire; especially fire
<Kammerjunk> pony_3066: Yes. We live in the Information Age.
*Nyria doesn't need weapons, because he wouldn't start a fight in the first place~
<Kammerjunk> For now.
<Starflash> >___>
<Sundaysmile> "temperature..."
<Radu> Goodbye everyone, have fun c:
<Kammerjunk> ACTA would put a stop to that, though.
<otakon> Cy`: Aye, we need no more old men in Congress
<MirrorImage> Nyria: lot of good that does you if someone else decides to start the fight
<Nyria> ta ta Radu ~
<Starflash> Bwah Cya Radu D:
<otakon> see ya Radu be well friend!
<Cy`> Nyria: I won't start a fight, I will finish one.
<pony_3066> Funny thing is, you describe socialism to most people, and they love the idea. Actually SAY "socialism" to anyone and they rage
<tvoie> i learn how to arm myself in practice so i can arm myself with knowlege in battle
<Cy`> otakon: By the time our generation reaches that point, it'll be too late.
<otakon> I know it looks that way
<otakon> but have faith!
<otakon> spread the word, people WILL act.
<Nyria> Well... I never needed it in the past... but just in case *slips his combat knife under his bed*
<otakon> I have one too
<Starflash> Nyria, you scary.
<Starflash> X'D
<otakon> I've been sharpening it
<Cy`> Nyria: You would be scared of what I sleep with.
<Nyria> hehe~
<pony_3066> Probably helps being prepared for a full scale zombie invasion. (Although I don't think it's gonna happen)
<ekips1> i used to have a wooden sword under my bed when i was little :D
<otakon> Yeah, that too
<Nyria> Cy`: Uh... I hope it's ponies~
<otakon> I have a Dadao
<Cy`> Nyria: Other than that.
<Kammerjunk> I shall make it my mission to spread the word of ACTA in any way possible!
<Cy`> I mean protection wise.
<Kammerjunk> I JUST need the link to the video.
<Starflash> I've got a nice iron bar here... It makes less of a mess than a combat knife~ *cough*
<Nyria> Cy`: Uh... A combat rifle?~ A box of C4~ A laugh gas?~ (To giggle at the ghosties)
<Kammerjunk> Starflash: I used to have an iron bar.
*VampirePrincess pokes cat
<VampirePrincess> hallo
<Kammerjunk> Then I poked myself in the eye with it.
<Starflash> ...why
<Kammerjunk> I got mad and threw it away.
<Sundaysmile> oh christ...
<Starflash> That's not really mad.
<Kammerjunk> I don't know!
<Sundaysmile> not another one
<Lulu> 07,01und game over
<otakon> stop?
<Starflash> That's just... oh well XD
<otakon> Lulu: what just happened?
<Kammerjunk> Luna is demonstrating ACTA?
<pony_3066> Episode finished
<otakon> I think so
*Cy` has two shotguns, three pistols, 6 knifes, a baseball bat, a gas mask, and homemade gaseous poisons.
<Nyria> . . .
<otakon> or mips just cut us off
<Nyria> Damn
<Starflash> Cy` you srs?
<Starflash> =w=
<pony_3066> Impressive
<Cy`> Mhm,
<otakon> damn Cy` you scary
<Cy`> And various other weapons
<Kammerjunk> Cy`: Feels bad living in a country where knifes over 7cm are illegal.
<Sundaysmile> chlorine is not a danger to riot cops might I add...
<Starflash> Ok everyone go to Cy`s when ACTA or SOPA.
<MidnightBolt> I can make landmines
<Starflash> Enough crap for an army there.
<derpy_pony> less acta, more ponies!
<Kammerjunk> If weapons were a right here, not a crime, I would so own a load of them.
<pony_3066> MORE PONIES.
<Cy`> I'm getting more soon,
<Lulu> 07,01where>
<Nyria> So... Cy` do you have that so when somebody insults MLP you could reason with him~
*Cy` is working on buying a couple AR-15's
<pony_3066> Show ponies during a UN conference: all world's problems solved.
<Kammerjunk> I like AR-15's.
<pony_3066> Kammerjunk, where do you live?
<Starflash> well, you can't really have any weapons here.
<Cy`> Nyria: Yes, and if people break into my house again.
<StickySyrup> hello everypony... im back. Just made some seriously good curry... =)
<Kammerjunk> pony_3066: Denmark.
<Kammerjunk> Feels bad, man.
<RawketLawnchair> Cy` is a stalker?
<Sundaysmile> Cy would do better not at advertise "if content is being monitored...."
<pony_3066> Ah
<Cy`> I'm not a stalker.
<RawketLawnchair> Get out of here, Stalker.
<Kammerjunk> RawketLawnchair: Don't just stand there! Come in!
<StickySyrup> so whats everypony talking about?
<Nyria> Cy`: Okay~ When the revloution starts I'll give you a call~
<Darf14> grr.... internet Derped on me :P
<Cy`> I've had people break in and attempt to hold me at gunpoint. Sawed-offs are soo helpful~ :3
<pony_3066> As long as us lot can stay in comms.
<Sundaysmile> people showing off their home armaments
<derpy_pony> I know that the bronies didn't exactly originate from the peace movement...but seeing them go militant were weird.
<pony_3066> Say, can we bounce communicaiton through the OFC yet?
<Starflash> Where do you live anyways Cy`o.o
<Nyria> Cy`: Oh, what's your kill count?~
<Cy`> Arkansas, and 7
<Starflash> That's not very legal in my country. XD
<Nyria> I'm guessing he lives in the Captiol wasteland Starflash ~
<StickySyrup> derpy_pony: Bronies going militant? what are you talking about? sounds good
<Starflash> LOL Nyria
<Starflash> exactly my thoughts
<Kammerjunk> Nyria: That would make me jelly.
*Cy` is going AFK for a sec.
<Kammerjunk> I want to listen to Three Dog.
<Nyria> I would love to meet three dog~
<Kammerjunk> Three Dog is so much more awesome than Mr. New Vegas.
<Starflash> OOowww
<pony_3066> But seriously. The things I have seen since I became a brony, from the community, in the form of relationship, communication, and content being made, has gone a long way to restoring my faith in humanity. It is without doubt one of the greatest things to happen to me in years.
<Nyria> Indeed Kammerjunk, Mr. NV is just a bot~ Really he is an AI~
<Darf14> I miss 3 dog, too bad he wasnt in NV
<Starflash> Cool pony_3066 :D
<RawketLawnchair> There are no heros left in man.
<derpy_pony> same here, pony_3066
<Sundaysmile> mr vegas was just too damned creepy
<Kammerjunk> ^
<otakon> pony_3066: agreed. I would be in a deep funk now without the bronies
<Nyria> pony_3066: That's a story that we can all say we've experinced, oh and /nick (instert name here)
<otakon> yeah
<Kammerjunk> I would be browsing 4chan right now if I didn't find love and tolerance.
<otakon> give us a proper nick to address you by!
<Nyria> we've all*
<Darf14> MR Vegas keeps playing that one song over and over again whenever I turn it on *strangles johnny guitar*
<otakon> lol
<pony_3066> I think we need a good ol' world peace movmement, cos I can see it here. Right now, as a general rule, I hate my country. But there are still the remnants of an awesome people. I'm going soon to do some chores anyway, so there's not much point
<Kammerjunk> Be back in a jiffy.
<otakon> I HATE Johnny Guitar
<ekips1> Kammerjunk: same here
<Nyria> The only reason I tune into NV is because 'Ain't that a kick in a head' plays on~
<MirrorImage> Darf14: there is a solution for that
<otakon> but I LOVE Big Iron
<Starflash> I can't say that I would be nowhere without finding this... but I'm glad I did. ^_^
<MirrorImage> go do Old World Blues and make your brain regret it
<Nyria> <3333 Ink spots
<otakon> MirrorImage: but that's a great addon
<ekips1> 4chan let me lose faith in humanity, my little pony restored it :)
<Darf14> lol
<pony_3066> ekips1 +1
<otakon> I feel like playing it now even
*Cy` is back
<MirrorImage> otakon: i know, i'm enjoying it... considering i started my first play through of it at level 5...
<pony_3066> or ekips2 if you will
<MirrorImage> and it suggested... 15+?
<pony_3066> long way from equestria has changed me
<otakon> MirrorImage: it's best to do it at LEAST level 20
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, LordCelestia.
<MirrorImage> yeah... i'm having a heck of a time doing "All My Friends Have Off Switches"
<Nyria> http://fuzzybuzz.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/122009702124.jpg
<otakon> hi LordCelestia the stream is kaput I'm afraid
<Nyria> Hey LC~
<MirrorImage> thankfully i grabbed the auto-doc first
<otakon> we were too late
*Cy` starts to laugh when the armaments talk ended up a Fallout talk. XD
<otakon> yeah
<Kammerjunk> Nyria: I beg to differ.
<otakon> Makes me wish i had a Turbo Plasma Caster
<Kammerjunk> Ponies originated from /co/.
<Nyria> I love those dear hearts and gentle people~
<MidnightBolt> Fallout 3 and NV need a sprint button
<MirrorImage> also helps that this happened to be an Energy Weapons/Diplomacy playthrough
<otakon> and Hardened Power Armor
<Darf14> Odd that we change the topic very quickly
<pony_3066> ANYHOO. I'm off to actually make some pots less full of food.
<Midnight_Tempest> you guys talking about New World Blues, that was my favorite NV DLC
<Randomnerd> Mods are asleep. Post Ponies.
<Nyria> Kammerjunk: We don't need that sight any more ^^ let it burn~
<pony_3066> So later guys.
<MirrorImage> so i had plenty of ammo for the Sonic Emitter
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: that'll be Fallout 4
<Randomnerd> Ponies are asleep. Post Mods.
<derpy_pony> the first pony war, which spread ponydom over the internets, happened on /b/
<derpy_pony> mostly
<Kammerjunk> Nyria: Fair point.
<pony_3066> Randomnerd *Mods are AWAKE, POSTING ponies.
<derpy_pony> february 2011
<ScootaChicken> Nyria, I beg to differ as well
<ekips> derpy_pony: i remember that time Oo
<Kammerjunk> I downloaded a mod to get a sprint function.
<Nyria> Oh really ?~
<MirrorImage> Kammerjunk: that would be Project Nevada, i believe
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<ScootaChicken> well, aside from Kammerjunk's point that ponies came from /co/
<Darf14> ./b/ ..... *shivers* ...the horror....
<Midnight_Tempest> well... im gonna go already, i have things to do outside of the house... outside... *shudders*
*Cy` is going to get off for now, until he gets home from work.
<Kammerjunk> Darf14: You get used to it.
<ScootaChicken> we wouldn't have half the wonderful memes we have now without 4chan
<Cy`> See you soon everypony! :3
<Nyria> That's it?~
<derpy_pony> I didn't care about 4chan back then...found the fandom in october
<Darf14> I will never visit that site again
<ekips> Kammerjunk: that is the worst part of /b/, you get used to it
<Nyria> ta ta Cy` ~
<pony_3066> Buh-bye e'rrypony
<Fleur> Cy`!
<ScootaChicken> Nyria, how many memes do you use on a regular basis?
<Starflash> Cya Cy`
<MirrorImage> indeed... and if 4chan hadn't evicted bronies, they probably wouldn't have spread like they have
<ScootaChicken> see ya Cy`
<Nyria> <333 this trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYZpR51XgW0
<MirrorImage> funny how that works
<derpy_pony> 4chan was cool until chanology happened
<pony_3066> l8rs Cy
<Nyria> ScootaChicken: All the meme's~!
<Fleur> talk to you later Cy`
<Nyria> Dammit
<Cy`> Hello and Bye Fleur! :3
<Starflash> :O Fleur!
<derpy_pony> yes, MirrorImage
<Nyria> Hey Fleur ~
<Kammerjunk> ekips: If I didn't get used to /b/, I wouldn't have stopped caring. If I hadn't stopped caring, I wouldn't have found this show and then started caring again.
<ScootaChicken> precisely Nyria
<ScootaChicken> you've just gone and proven my point
<Mr_me> i haven't been to 4chan in months... not that that's a bad thing
<Starflash> What's /b/ and /co/ anyways =w='' or... do i even want to know
<Nyria> Though I still hate 4Chan~
<Nyria> Or really really really really dislike it~
<Gumri> Hello everyone!
<Fleur> did Sumica leave already...?
<Nyria> Hey Gumri ~
<derpy_pony> the /co/ stands for comics
<Starflash> Ello Gumri
<Darf14> dont ask Starflash or you might regret it
<ekips> Kammerjunk: so..bad things can -sometimes- lead to goot outcomes
<Sumica> 00,10nope
<Fleur> :D!
<Gumri> is there not a stream on?
*Fleur hugs Sumica
<Kammerjunk> It's still nice being able to look at anything and not get sick, though.
<derpy_pony> and /b/ was all the other stuff when /a/ was anime and no other boards existed
<RawketLawnchair> Where the streams at.
<Starflash> oooo ok
<Sundaysmile> mods killed em
<Sundaysmile> because of acta
<Nyria> Uh... I'm not going to even try
<Nyria> ~
<Gumri> acta isnt even bad as far as i can tell.
<Sundaysmile> lol
<Kammerjunk> Does anypony have the link to that ACTA video?
<Kammerjunk> Gumri: Yes, it is.
<emangamer> when will the government leave us the FUCK lone
<Starflash> So yeah. I'm so happy I've got nothing to do with 4Chan~~~~
<Darf14> nope
<Sundaysmile> just search on youtube
<emangamer> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=N8Xg_C2YmG0
<Sundaysmile> it'll be everywhere...
<Gumri> Why is it bad?
<Darf14> short version, if it passes, fannon dies
<Kammerjunk> Gumri: Basically, it's worldwide SOPA except it allows every single packet of data you send out to be monitored.
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, and no more fan sites.
<Kammerjunk> They're gone too.
<ScootaChicken> if ACTA passes
<ScootaChicken> we're all fucked
<ScootaChicken> I think its quite simple really
<Shizuka> 13then we go together
<derpy_pony> how exactly will they monitor encrypted connections?
<ekips> well i gotta go, bye everypony :)
<Darf14> bye ekips
<RawketLawnchair> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWtY0x7o4eU Have this in the meanwhile.
<Gumri> Well since SOPA didn't pass that has no chance in hell to pass.
<Kammerjunk> derpy_pony: And that's where SOPA would fail, too.
<Sundaysmile> bear in mind the prosecution is not in the hands of the government but the company who owns the material shared
<MirrorImage> Gumri: the USA has already signed it...
<MirrorImage> it's just a matter of what they'll do to *try* and enforce it
<Gumri> im sorry? what?
<Kammerjunk> derpy_pony: They just don't know how the Internet works.
<Shizuka> 13never attribute to malice what you can attribute to colossal stupidity, and celestia knows the US government has that in *spades*
<Kammerjunk> And in the Information Age, that's just not alright.
<Sundaysmile> if the owner does not wish to prosecute then your freedom is "safe"
<Mr_me> perhaps it's time for a new age...
<Kammerjunk> It's not okay to NOT know how the Internet works anymore, and ESPECIALLY not if you want to deal with it.
<MirrorImage> ACTA is a worldwide treaty that's supposed to establish various intellictual property-protecting procedures
<otakon> LordCelestia: HERE! Click this and LAUGH! http://youtu.be/nohsA4R_1HU?t=3m49s
<emangamer> Ohai Shizuka <3
<MirrorImage> they haven't been established yet, though
<Randomnerd> Especially if you want to OWN the internet.
<Shizuka> 13hi emangamer
<LordCelestia> 0,5>_>
<otakon> hi emangamer
<MirrorImage> so there's still plenty of time for us to pull out the rolled-up newspapers, walk up to Obama, and yell "STOP IT!"
<emangamer> hey otakon
<Darf14> hi emangamer
<tvoie> emangamer's here!?!
<emangamer> how are you today Shizuka?
<derpy_pony> it's politics...they don't need to know, they just need to make the decisions they are paid for
<MirrorImage> also, i think Bush might've been the one to sign it if i read the wikipedia article correctly...
<Kammerjunk> Randomnerd: And that's another thing. It's not alright to claim authority over the Internet.
<Nyria> A suit of bacon~! Victory~~!
<Gumri> oh i see so ACTA just stops file sharing? is that it?
<RawketLawnchair> A suit of bacon.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Suit of bacon.....
<MirrorImage> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement
<RawketLawnchair> I actually think that suit is supposed to be crab shell
<LordCelestia> 0,5======================================================
<Shizuka> 13not as well as i'd like
<Kammerjunk> Gumri: Oh, no.
<RawketLawnchair> But I could be wrong.
<LordCelestia> 0,5LEEROOOY BAAAACOOOOOON
<Darf14> mmm... backon
<Nyria> Internet is a free place~ Though I like to think the internet is another country~
<otakon> LordCelestia: I KNEW you'd like that
<Kammerjunk> Gumri: ACTA stops everything.
<Randomnerd> Well, arguing over who OWNS to internet is pretty self-defeating.
<Darf14> I mean bacon *facehoof*
<Nyria> as an another*
<Gumri> define: 'everything'
<derpy_pony> Internet is like a big metropolis
<otakon> Randomnerd: not who owns the internet, who owns the stuff you post
<RawketLawnchair> LEEEEROOOOY WINGKIIIIINS!
<Nyria> Gumri: The internet~
<Nyria> and life
<Kammerjunk> Gumri: I mean that it's illegal if you didn't create every. Single. Aspect. You made pony fan images? nope.avi
<derpy_pony> if you can think of it, someone already founded a club for people who do it
<Kammerjunk> You found this funny song and sent it to your friend so he could hear it? nope.avi
<Randomnerd> I follow otakon. trouble is some people think they do.
<Gumri> hmm ok
<Sundaysmile> sooooo much facehoof right now
<Kammerjunk> You want privacy without using an encrypted connection? lolnope
<Sundaysmile> i'm out guys
<Randomnerd> 30 years ago, you could argue the Department of Defense owned the internet, or was closest to it.
<Randomnerd> Bye, Sundaysmile
<Kammerjunk> Too late.
<otakon> Gumri: you look at ANYTHING that has a copyright associated with it and the owner of the copyright doesn't give explicit instructions that you can, BOOM! You can be fined, imprisoned and even have your ISP pulled COMPLETELY.
<otakon> Fan art
<Nyria> I'm going to play Viva La Vida everyday until the war with Anonymous and USA, Europe, and Austrailia~ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvgZkm1xWPE&ob=av3n
<Kammerjunk> otakon: Gumri just left.
<emangamer> I think I'mma have to go everypony....I know my time here was short lived, but I'll make it up to you
<Randomnerd> Now it's basically like owning a piece of the sky, how do you do it?
<otakon> damn
<Randomnerd> See ya emangamer
<emangamer> bye everypony <3
<Nyria> Until the end of the war*
<otakon> emangamer: bye, come back soon!
<Nyria> ta ta emangamer ~
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, emangamer.
<emangamer> oh my god
<emangamer> so many pings ,3
<emangamer> <3*
<Darf14> bye emangamer.... wow short visit :)
<emangamer> I think the emoticon needs to pop up when people type <3, ,3, or <#
<Gumri> So has this ACTA been signed then?
<derpy_pony> gtg, have fun everybody!
<Nyria> ta ta derpy_pony ~
<Kammerjunk> I'm going to play Only Time Will Tell every day until it is finally decided. It's a song about a different subject, but the first verse fits this situation spot on.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Make a stand against ACTA
<LordCelestia> 0,5Tell EVERYONE
<RawketLawnchair> Old men, are the future.
<LordCelestia> 0,5EVERY
<LordCelestia> 0,5ONE
<Kammerjunk> LordCelestia: I will. More at a time.
<Kammerjunk> I have a past of spreading a message.
<Gumri> Fine.... let me just announce on XBOX Live...
<Kammerjunk> Or messages, rather.
<Nyria> Though I must say... The internet will have to unite~ So... Hopefully the war between 4Chan and Ponies will be delayed~
<Kammerjunk> LordCelestia: But first, could you post the link to the video?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Ugh
<LordCelestia> 0,5One sec
<Gumri> I thourght that war had subsided Nyria
<Kammerjunk> Sorry.
<LordCelestia> 0,5All you need to know:
<Nyria> Gumri: It's still going on~ Just not that bad Remember 1/1/12 ~
<LordCelestia> 0,5Its like they took SOPA and injected it with ten times more bad stuff for us.
<LordCelestia> 0,5It means bye bye Bronystate
<Kammerjunk> It means bye bye freedom.
<ScootaChicken_> LordCelestia, I think we've established that by now...
<Gumri> of course.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Not everyone Neil
<LordCelestia> 0,5We need to spread it far and wide
<ScootaChicken_> mfw you call me by my real name on IRC...
<MirrorImage> reading through the text of ACTA myself right now - http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/leaks/Anti-Counterfeiting%20Trade%20Agreement.pdf
<Nyria> Yean Neil~
<Apokalipse> Hi Neil
<ScootaChicken_> quiet Charles
<Nyria> Neil Clake~
<ScootaChicken_> you too Joe
<Nyria> ^^
<ScootaChicken_> mfw you spelt my last name wrong >.>
<Kammerjunk> Well, so far, it's worked to post what people need to know in public places.
<Nyria> how do you spell it?~
<Kammerjunk> It doesn't have to be long.
<MirrorImage> i have seen ONE good thing that i like so far: Article 2.5 - a person who has been found to have NOT infringed on intellictual party, the prosecuting party will be liable for damages to the defendant
<ScootaChicken_> Nyria... you see it every day on skype >.>
<Nyria> Clarke*
<MirrorImage> so there's at least reason for the copyright holders to not press on everything
<RawketLawnchair> Pffft haha.
<MadxHatter123> Ok, I have officially found the best thing ever.
<RawketLawnchair> http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/023/5/d/discord_being_discord_by_mickeymonster-d4neld1.png
<Gumri> What that might that be
<MadxHatter123> This site.
<Gumri> go to the #bronystate room by the way :)
<Kammerjunk> Like, Anonymous once had a thing going called Project What's-It's-Face (I don't really remember), and the idea was to spread the word of a specific date, somewhere in 2013, and spread it everywhere.
<MadxHatter123> ok
<MirrorImage> RawketLawnchair: oh god wat
<Gumri> lol RawketLawnchair
<MadxHatter123> Oh, so this is where everyone is.
<Kammerjunk> I'll work out the details when I get home on Friday and start spreading the message.
<Nyria> haha~
<Kammerjunk> I'll need materials from home.
<Nyria> Yeah, I'm going to spread far and wide~
<ScootaChicken_> I've already spammed it to my facebook
<ScootaChicken_> and email
<Nyria> So... Who has 4Chan?~
<ScootaChicken_> and I've emailed my headteacher to see if he'll make an announcement in assembly tomorrow
<Darf14> lol, that comic was funny :)
<kirzstryfe> 11,14RawketLawnchair, that was awesome
<LordCelestia> 0,5RawketLawnChair that happened to me one time. I did it to myself. I had a bacon cone.
<LordCelestia> 0,5A bacon, er, ice cream
*Nyria eats the bacon cone~
<LordCelestia> 0,5Nyria
<otakon> OOOH!
<LordCelestia> 0,5Y U PUT ~ EVERYWHER
*MirrorImage plucks a piece of hair from LordCelestia's mane and puts it on a frying pan
<Nyria> I ~ know ~ Right ~
<otakon> Has ANYONE tried the bacon sundae from Denny's when it came out?
<otakon> ANyone?
*LordCelestia raises a hoof
<otakon> was it good?
<ScootaChicken_> oh, so you call him Nyria, but you call me Neil?

<Nyria> http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5256/5538404877_50ae62a4b0.jpg
<otakon> ScootaChicken_: I call him Briffic
<ScootaChicken_> whatever you say Joe
<Kammerjunk> I propose using what ACTA would regulate and make sure this becomes widespread via the Internet.
<RawketLawnchair> http://www.tumblr.com/photo/1280/askmlcblobs/16405785076/1/tumblr_lyanlfDmCT1r5x4s2 Cute.
<otakon> so cute
<Nyria> d'aw~
<Kammerjunk> If you try, I'm sure you can get hold of a list of a bunch of e-mails.
<otakon> SO FRIGGIN CUTE!
<Gumri> Has ACTA been passed then?
<Gumri> do we need to unite
<Kammerjunk> Gumri: No. It's been signed in the US.
<Kammerjunk> But it needs to be signed by the UN too.
<Nyria> In the future I would love to tell the story of the great war beetween USA and Anonymous~
<RawketLawnchair> Didn't the UN say they wouldn't sign it?
<Gumri> the EU looked at it and said "fuk dat"
<Gumri> well not exactly those words but you know
<Ingwaz> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-background-ponies-better-than-mane-six.jpg
<tvoie> so... sopa and pipa were just smokescreens to distract us from the real threat!
<CK|Mer> Nyria: What war?
<MadxHatter123> Ok, now that I have gone back and read the stuff I should have read before, I'm good.
<RawketLawnchair> Ha ha.
<Nyria> Give me a sec CK|Mer ~
<CK|Mer> You realize how fast it'd be over if the US government truly cared?
<Gumri> I pledge my alliance to anon. The internet must remain free!
<Nyria> CK|Mer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Xg_C2YmG0&list=FLXgHqoqFvpsqBPpYnWlCdRw&index=2&feature=plpp_video About to the end~
<tvoie> is there anything we can do to help anon?
<CK|Mer> Fact is, they see 'em as a nuisance, not a threat
<Gumri> proteset tvoie
<Kammerjunk> This may be very wrong, but I kind of get a little excited to pick up the old mantle and start spreading messages again.
<MadxHatter123> Oh, and I was wondering, I didn't see anything about making a permanent chat name, is there a way to do that, or do we stick with typing them in every time we join?
<Nyria> wait CK|Mer It's the other one~ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roMf2RmRzFc&feature=related
<Darf14> *sigh* ..... I really dislike politics -_-;
<CK|Mer> ...which is probably fair. They really haven't done anything truly dangerous.
<tvoie> protest?
<tvoie> sounds like a plan!
<Kammerjunk> MadxHatter123: You can register your name so that no one else can claim it.
*Cy is home from work,
<Gumri> curse you google chrome
*ScootaChicken_ hugs Cy
<Nyria> Hey Cy ~
<MadxHatter123> Ok, how do I do that?
<Gumri> hi Cy
*Cy hugs ScootaChicken_
<Cy> Hello everypony.
<tvoie> it's three in the afternoon, should it be dark yet?
<Kammerjunk> MadxHatter123: Err... Une momento.
<MadxHatter123> ok
<CK|Mer> Nyria: Problem with that message is that it's two years old
<CK|Mer> ACTA was already signed by the US
<Nyria> Voderful`
<Nyria> ~
<Gumri> So no stream today? just convosations about ACTA?
<Kammerjunk> Ah, here it is.
<CK|Mer> And several other countries
<Nyria> Well I just wathced it ~
<Kammerjunk> MadxHatter123: Use /msg NickServ register
<CK|Mer> It's been in business for some time.
<Nyria> mhm~
<Kammerjunk> Gumri: The former as a result of the latter.
<CK|Mer> And see, the core problem has nothing to do with protecting copyrights but rather copyrights themselves
<MadxHatter123> ok, thanks, I'm going to be on here often now that I found it(and caught up with the show episodes) and I use this name a lot and would like to cement it for here.
<Asmalya> Why am i so tired *yawns*
<Kammerjunk> Piss of a country, then you're dealing with a slaughter! You try to quell it, but the fire's getting hotter! You make the motions 'till you citizens despise you. They pick another and the cycle starts anew!
<Nyria> Hey Asmalya ^^
*Nyria hugs Asmalya ~
<Fleur> Wrek: It says you have a poll on DA but I dont know how to get to it :(
<MadxHatter123> Kammerjunk: ...where do I type that in?
<Asmalya> HEyas Nyria <3
<Kammerjunk> MadxHatter123: Well, do you use the IRC on the site, or do you have a client?
<MadxHatter123> ...uh. I should know this seeing as I'm in computer repair...
<Ictiv> I have a phantom feeling that Bronies are safe from Acta...
<Ictiv> I'm just amazed right now actually...
<Ictiv> I've read something that is just...wo
<Kammerjunk> MadxHatter123: Are you on PonyChat via an external client which you downloaded?
<Ictiv> wow*
<CK|Mer> See, you want to hear the TRUE problem, the Jimquisition has actually expressed it rather well.
<Kammerjunk> Or are you on the BronyState site?
*Nyria is always on the bronystate site~
<CK|Mer> Mods, okay if I post a vid link? ^_^
<Cy> Stupid D/c
<MadxHatter123> Uh, I'm using Google Chrome which I downloaded when I got my laptop.
*Cy glomps Asmalya
<Ictiv> Seriously people. Read this: http://mlpfananimproject.tumblr.com/post/16421903515/this-is-what-is-going-on
<Kammerjunk> CK|Mer: No stream is running, so it's automatically OK.
<Nyria> Nothing's playing My friend~ So post away CK|Mer ~
<CK|Mer> http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/jimquisition/5268-Piracy-Episode-One-Copyright
*Asmalya is clomped
<rainbowheaven> hello?
<Cy> :3
<CK|Mer> There ya go. You want to know the actual problem behind the concept of "protecting copyrights", that video spells it out very well.
<rainbowheaven> Hi
<MadxHatter123> Ictiv: You just posted something that reeeeealy interests me.
<Kammerjunk> MadxHatter123: So you're typing from bronystate.com/theatre/whatever?
<Kammerjunk> .net*
<rainbowheaven> :|
<Ictiv> MadxHatter123: I know, right? Hasbro sponsoring, and in fact helping to make a Fan Fic video adaptation!
<Ictiv> That's just...
<Nyria> Kammerjunk: 404~!
<Ictiv> wow
<MadxHatter123> almost, it's that but with twilight in place of whatever
<Nyria> http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/fluttershy/
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: Must be top quality.
<Nyria> there you go ^^
<Darf14> wow.... didn't expect that
<rainbowheaven> :)
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: no really, check it out
<Nyria> Oh I didn't see the whatever~!
<Nyria> I mean ~*
<Kammerjunk> Nyria: :3
<rainbowheaven> ok i'm bored already...
*Cy starts to play with one of his kunai blades. :3
<Kammerjunk> Hi, rainbowheaven.
<Nyria> Oh my~ I should ... yeah~
<Gumri> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/internet-memes-world-wide-web-war-i.jpg
<Fleur> and then Nyria links to the correct room
<Kammerjunk> rainbowheaven: We're discussing the Internet and freedom.
<rainbowheaven> Kammerjunk: oh...okay.
<MadxHatter123> and trying to help a newbie register his name.
<Kammerjunk> MadxHatter123: Then you can just type it in #bronystate, as long as you remember to put the slash in the beginning.
<Nyria> I just hope america becomes to Enclave~
<MadxHatter123> ok
<Nyria> doesn't*
*Cy starts to fix one of his guitars
<Nyria> I do not want that~
<Kammerjunk> If Denmark accepts ACTA, I'm going straight to America.
<VampirePrincess> kitten! hihi
<VampirePrincess> :)
*Gumri picks up his daggeer and fucks around with it, hoping he doesn't cut his fingers off
<rainbowheaven> <3
<Kammerjunk> At least I'll be able to own knifes longer than 7 cm there.
<Kammerjunk> Gumri: What kind of knife is it?
<Gumri> a big one.
<Kammerjunk> Uh-huh.
<MadxHatter123> Ok, here goes
<Gumri> i don't know
<Nyria> So your doing it while your typing Gumri?~ Sounds legit~
<Kammerjunk> I used to like butterfly knifes. But I then I found out my friend has one, and it gets boring after a while.
<Gumri> It looks similar to the klingon dagger
<Kammerjunk> Oh, right.
<Ingwaz> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-doesnt-matter-has-applejack.jpg
<Gumri> kind of anyway
*Nyria Only needs a combat knife~
<MirrorImage> and on a completely different note, i have a purring kitty on my lap now who demands that i pet her...
<MadxHatter123> ...Ok, lets try this again
<Starflash> Whoa...
<Nyria> Hey Starflash ~
<Starflash> Poland is seriously fighting against ACTA. Dat unexpected nice assistance~
<Nyria> indeed it is ^^
<Kammerjunk> I really like bowie knives.
<Kammerjunk> They look neat.
<Starflash> Oh and hey Nyria~ although I've been lurking all the time~
<Randomnerd> I have a lockback, that's about it.
<Nyria> Oh you have Starflash ?~
<Nyria> Your good at it~
<Starflash> Yeah. :3
<Randomnerd> It's gerber, and that's decent.
<Starflash> ...
<Starflash> At lurking? =w=
<Kammerjunk> Denmark, being a nation with legal prostitution, sex from the age of 15 and alcohol from the age of 16.
<rainbowheaven> Starflash: wut is ACTA?
<Nyria> No no, that's not something bad~
<Kammerjunk> I hope we oppose ACTA.
<Kammerjunk> rainbowheaven: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Xg_C2YmG0&list=FLXgHqoqFvpsqBPpYnWlCdRw&index=2&feature=plpp_video
<MadxHatter123> Ok, what do I need to type exactly, is it /msg NickServ register <insertpasswordhere> <insertmyemailhere>?
<Nyria> I mean, your good at... Uh...
<Nyria> wub?~
<Starflash> thanks Kammerjunk. too lazy to look up the link :3
<Starflash> Nyria Wub. :3
<Kammerjunk> It's in my clipboard.
<Nyria> yay~! wub <3
*Starflash jumphugs Nyria
<Starflash> So anyways.
<Gumri> I wonder what is going to happen with ACTA in the UK, what with the conservitive government and all.
*Nyria jumphugs back~
<Kammerjunk> Denmark is a very socialistic country.
<Kammerjunk> So that's nice too.
<Kammerjunk> It's also nice having free health care.
<Gumri> The UK is after years and years of labour but recently the conservitive scum got into power
<Kammerjunk> Not that I ever get sick, but I keep getting myself injured.
<Kammerjunk> MadxHatter123: Oh, no.
<RawketLawnchair> http://i42.tinypic.com/2le2z4p.png Ha ha, clever.
<RawketLawnchair> http://i42.tinypic.com/2le2z4p.png Ha ha.
<Kammerjunk> It's /msg NickServ register <username> <password>
<Randomnerd> Here in the US, our process has been pretty well subverted by corporate interests.
<Kammerjunk> RawketLawnchair: Do ho ho.
<MadxHatter123> Kammerjunk: That never gets sick thing, but hurts self sounds like me. And ok, good thing I didn't do that then.
<kirzstryfe> 11,14lol
<rainbowheaven> OKay.. i get it, thanks Kammerjunk. ;)
<Kammerjunk> No problem.
<Randomnerd> Mathematically, we have two parties, as we have "Winner Take-All" elections.
<Nyria> hahahaha RawketLawnchair ~
<Kammerjunk> Denmark wouldn't really gain anything from ACTA.
<Randomnerd> So they basically have the same position on many issues, it's really just a question of degrees.
*RawketLawnchair gives A wub button to Nyria
<RawketLawnchair> Wub wub.
<Kammerjunk> Our primary export farm stuff.
<CK|Mer> No one gains from ACTA.
<CK|Mer> Except the RIAA and the like.
<Nyria> RawketLawnchair: Really?~ I can have it!~
<Kammerjunk> CK|Mer: Publishers do.
<Randomnerd> No HUMAN, gains from ACTA.
<Gumri> nowhere would gain anything from ACTA apart from Rich people in the US
<arrowtobroknee> lol humans
<RawketLawnchair> Yes, its all yours, Nyria.
<CK|Mer> That's why I said the second part.
<CK|Mer> ;)
<Nyria> O: ~ yay~
<Kammerjunk> Well, humans are silly anyway.
<Randomnerd> There are plenty of Corporations that gain from ACTA.
<Nyria> wubwubwubwubwubwubwub
<Randomnerd> ...And a corporation is NOT a person.
<CK|Mer> Naw
<Gumri> Corporations can go to hell.... Fucking capitalism should burn in a fire
<CK|Mer> Mostly the publishers gain, most corporations that aren't actually publishing don't gain squat
<MadxHatter123> Kammerjunk: Hmm, it's telling me to put it as <password> followed by <email>
<Randomnerd> Well, the US has never had Lessaiz-Faire Capitalism, that's for sure.
<Kammerjunk> Gumri: "What a world," I said, "where trademarks run the people."
<Randomnerd> ^
<rainbowheaven> ...i don't know wut to say. :(
<Kammerjunk> MadxHatter123: Hold on.
<Randomnerd> A Legal Fiction is now a person, but people are getting closer to commodities.
<MadxHatter123> Kammerjunk:ok
<arrowtobroknee> wow, random, that's deep
<MadxHatter123> AH! wrong thing!
<Kammertest> Okay.
<MadxHatter123> it should have been Kammerjunk: ok
<Kammertest> I get it now.
<Randomnerd> arrowtobroknee: I don't know if that's sarcasm or not :D
<Kammertest> You have you use your password and then your email, yes.
<MadxHatter123> ok
<Kammertest> As you said it, right.
<Kammertest> It just registers your name, then.
<arrowtobroknee> it wasn't mean as sarcasm:(
<Ictiv> Gumri: As much as I'd like to agree with you, we managed to build our entire civillization around Capitalism. We can't just throw it out the window without sending a formal invitation to Discord to come and rule for a few hundred years
<Ictiv> Also:
<rainbowheaven> ......:P
<Ictiv> My caht is bugged again!
<Ictiv> Yay!
<Gumri> We need a new system in my opinion
<Kammerjunk> Your what-now?
<Nyria> yay a cat~
<Asmalya> i disagree Ictiv
<arrowtobroknee> verman supreme
<Kammerjunk> I feel so bad for my cat.
<Asmalya> Capitalism is like what?
<arrowtobroknee> ponies for all
<Asmalya> very young...
<Randomnerd> arrowtobroknee: My fault, the internet is bad for dialogue.
<Ictiv> Asmalaya, hold the thought
<Ictiv> I'll be back in a moment
*emangamer is back
<MadxHatter123> NickServ lies. It says my email is not a email address. Does it not accept gmail?
<Gumri> Hi emangamer
<Nyria> Hey emangamer ~!
<rainbowheaven> My cat eats my mom's earplugs..6_9
<Randomnerd> Yes! Vermin Supreme is offering ponies!
<Kammerjunk> My cat has to stay at my grandparents until Friday, when we can move back into our house, and her home is completely unfamiliar to him ):
<emangamer> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-now-youve-done-it-aj.jpg
<Gumri> Asmalya: it is like a steamy shit
<emangamer> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-background-ponies-better-than-mane-six.jpg
<emangamer> ok I really have to chill with the links dont I?
<arrowtobroknee> poor AJ
<Kammerjunk> David Tennant has got NOTHING on Fury of the Pink.
<Randomnerd> Hah.
<arrowtobroknee> she's next week
<Ictiv> okay, fixed client
<rainbowheaven> I mean literally eats them and swallows them.
<Kammerjunk> rainbowheaven: wat
<Ictiv> I read you as far as "capitalism is very young" Asmalya
<Kammerjunk> To be fair, my dog eats muffin forms
<Ictiv> Did you say anything since?
<Asmalya> Nope
<Ictiv> Well
<Asmalya> But yes it is
<MadxHatter123> Kammerjunk: LIES! unless the Fury of the Pink is Pinkie, then that is totally true.
<rainbowheaven> Kammerjunk: I know, right? It's crazy!
<Ictiv> Capitalism is the oldest thing we have
<Randomnerd> :-/ I'm basically turning into a Social Democrat. There is no such party in my country.
<Asmalya> No?
<Kammerjunk> MadxHatter123: Oh, it is.
<Ictiv> Yes
<Ictiv> Capitalism stepped in the door when the first gold coin was made
<Ictiv> It changed, yes
<arrowtobroknee> Be like the UK, with a socialist/capitalist split
<Ictiv> it became prettier
<Kammerjunk> Also, MadxHatter123: I don't quite know. It should recognise an email address as long as you have the @ and the .com parts.
<Ictiv> but it was born when people declared that "This is mine"
<Kammerjunk> Or .anything, really.
<Randomnerd> Well, Greed is as old as the species, but Capitalism is the first time such a thing was channeled in a way it was effective.
<ScootaChicken_> alright guys my internet's turning off soon
<ScootaChicken_> so bye
<Asmalya> No?
<emangamer> <3 ScootaChicken_ <3
<arrowtobroknee> bye scoot
<Ictiv> Yes
<Gumri> arrowtobroknee: It is nice like that but i would enjoy a new system all together
<Kammerjunk> See you, ScootaChicken_.
<ScootaChicken_> probably be back in a couple hours
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02I just ate a hot dog :3
<Ictiv> Define Capitlism Asmalya
<Darf14> bye SchootaChicken
<Asmalya> you can have people own stuff without having capitalism
<MadxHatter123> Kammerjunk: hmm, maybe I put it in wrong, let me try again.
<emangamer> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-chimmycherry-or-cherrychanga.png
<Ictiv> Capitalism*
<Gumri> SB <3 hello
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02BAi Scootachicken!
<Ictiv> Asmalya: Then define it, what is it
<Randomnerd> In many systems, greed is expected to somehow be expunged.
<emangamer> SuperBrony64|AFK: <3
<Kammerjunk> I don't really think socialism is as bad as some Americans I know make it out to be.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02And hai everypony!
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, SB.
<Darf14> Hi SB64
<Randomnerd> Americans don't realize that we ARE socialists.
<arrowtobroknee> We should be like the ferengi's ultra capitalist society
<rainbowheaven> SuperBrony64|AFK: Hi.
<Randomnerd> Just not to the degree other nations are.
<Gumri> Socalism isnt bad, it's just been given a bad name because of the USSR
<Asmalya> I would like but i wont have this discussion on english :P
<Gumri> and Korea
<rainbowheaven> Sry, i'm kinda new here...:S
<CK|Mer> Americans are deathly afraid of the word socialism, Randomnerd, mostly because they don't know what it means.
<Gumri> It is easy to fear what you don't understand
<Randomnerd> -The Military is a government organization we all pay taxes for, and support on the grounds that NO PRIVATE entity could provide the service.
<arrowtobroknee> They still think of cold war?
<CK|Mer> McCarthy pretty much assured that.
<emangamer> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/41280d0c-0fc5-4092-896b-860c9904208e.jpg
<Ictiv> Asmalya: how do you mean?
<Kammerjunk> CK|Mer: Which I just don't think is alright anymore.
<RawketLawnchair> S'alreight, rainbowheaven .
<emangamer> Ohai rainbowheaven :)
<RawketLawnchair> Yous seem like an ok guy to me.
*emangamer gives rainbowheaven a hug
<arrowtobroknee> we welcome new people
<MadxHatter123> Ok, this thing doesn't like my email... let me try leaving and coming back and starting fresh. BRB.
*Gumri wonders if there are any diehard capitalists here
<Kammerjunk> We're living in a world where the largest repository (Not sure if that's the right word for it) known to mankind can be found in your pocket.
<arrowtobroknee> I've only been here since friday
<Cy> Well, testing a theory on my guitar has now costed me string and 4 days of work... Great...
<rainbowheaven> emangamer: thnx :)
<Darf14> your ok rainbowheaven *hugs*
<Kammerjunk> It's not alright to hate something and not know what it is anymore.
<RawketLawnchair> IMMA CAPITALIST, AND IMMA NAICE GUUUUUUY
<Cy> strings*
<RawketLawnchair> Ha ha, points for the reference.
<CK|Mer> Well see, McCarthy's slander and blatant lies still effect this country's perceptions. Nowadays if you say something is a socialist program, they get the mental image of Stalin and the commies, and they freak out.
<Saturn> 8,1damnit, my glasses are behaving wonkily now
<otakon> SuperBrony64|AFK: you back?
<Randomnerd> ...We have many "socialist" services. The Post Office, which is no longer really effective... hell, sailors were expected to pay for their own health insurance, and were mandated to do so.
<Saturn> 8,1i forgot to take them off when i showered
<rainbowheaven> Darf14: Thnx :)
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: I did that too, once.
<otakon> sorry I was watching john tron
<otakon> okay, brb
<Gumri> Silly Saturn how can you do that!
<arrowtobroknee> john who?
<Nyria> I do that Saturn ~ Once I forgot to take off my socks~
<Kammerjunk> But I use contacts now.
<RawketLawnchair> How could you forget to take off your glasses like that?
<RawketLawnchair> Thats just full on derp.
<Randomnerd> The argument that "No American has ever been ORDERED to buy anything by the government" Is a lie.
<Kammerjunk> RawketLawnchair: It's rather easy, actually.
<emangamer> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/72ca7882-b1d2-406d-8752-7d1e0a676a6f.jpg
<Cyanide> Well, testing a theory on my guitar has now costed me strings and 4 days of work... Great...
<Saturn> 8,1Gumri: they're on my face all the time, i don't even notice them!
<CK|Mer> Eh, the post office is a poorly run business, not really a socialist program.
<Saturn> 8,1like some kind of eye-correcting parasite
<Asmalya> Ictiv: Iam too tired to translate everthying in english. I still thing capitalism is not that much old since well...you cant just say "oh if people want to own stuff thats capitaislm therefore its 3k ears old" in my opinion...i dont think they had capitaism in the roman empire and that was probably longer then our current
<emangamer> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/630c73d1-d77b-4259-bd89-86e6e493c356.jpg
<emangamer> ^^^^^^6
<Fleur> that video that is in the newsletter was not a video of our chat.
<CK|Mer> They've fallen on their own faces and failed to manage their budgets properly, which is only natural because it's run by the government.
<Fleur> there was not a single mod in there
<Kammerjunk> RawketLawnchair: Once, I wondered for a moment where the hay my glasses were, when they were right on the bridge of my nose.
<arrowtobroknee> lol at fluttershy's pistol
<MadxHatter123> I HAVE RETURNED!! Ok, no more shouting.
<Randomnerd> George Washington issued an executive order that expected all able-bodied men to supply their own weapons.
<Kammerjunk> You don't really notice them when you've gotten used to them
<arrowtobroknee> the 3rd amemendment\?
<RawketLawnchair> A tree?
<Fleur> and I remember atleast Lulu saying something in that part
<emangamer> Fleur: it says it was. To everyone who asked: This was Pinkie Pie's room on bronystate
<rainbowheaven> did anypony see the last roundup? stupid question...
<Kammerjunk> rainbowheaven: derp
<arrowtobroknee> of course
<Randomnerd> The thing is the USPS must be run at a loss because it has to deleiver everywhere, everyday.
<Fleur> hmm
<Randomnerd> deliver, rather.
<rainbowheaven> Kammerjunk: Yes.. derp...
<Fleur> shoulda recorded the mane chat
<Gumri> Last roundup AKA best episode ever
<arrowtobroknee> indeed
<MadxHatter123> Oh, wait, I think I now what I'm doing wrong.
*Fleur knows that every ep gets better and better
*emangamer hugs Fleur
<arrowtobroknee> or the cutie mark chronicles
<RawketLawnchair> The Last Roundup was pretty damn awesome.
*Fleur cant wait for the next ep
<Nyria> Every episode is the best episode ever~ there going to keep on out doing them selves every time~
*Fleur hugs emangamer
<Kammerjunk> Fleur: The way I heard it, the mane chat was down because every one of the Mane 6 rooms had 5000 users.
<emangamer> rainbowheaven: http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly892sSiSg1r88ssco1_500.jpg
<Randomnerd> If run by a private entity, some people would only get mail when it was worth the price of Fuel to deliver it.
<Fleur> I was in the mane chat
<CK|Mer> That's my point though, Randomnerd. Americans are incapable of perceiving "socialist" as anything but evil, because we're generally uninformed and let the media tell us what to think. :p
<emangamer> How are you today Fleur?
<Randomnerd> So you'd have to pay out the nose to send a letter, or it'd stack up for weeks until they could justify the cost.
<Kammerjunk> CK|Mer: Fox News?
<Fleur> It exploded like nobody would believe!
<MadxHatter123> Ok, there we go. I am all set.
<rainbowheaven> emangamer: yes. yes i am. :$
<arrowtobroknee> 5000 x 6 is 30,000, when there are only 10K bronies on record
<Nyria> Oh hey Fleur ~
<RawketLawnchair> An explosion of reactions.
<Nyria> I'm blind, I didn't see you there~
<Fleur> I am good today emangamer
<Darf14> cool Fleur is here
<Gumri> I live how the American christians only folly all the bad parts of the bible and ignore things like the golden rule "Treat others how you would like to be treated"
<emangamer> rainbowheaven: dont worry, we were all new at some point. Just remember RAWRity and I are the ponymeme guys.
<CK|Mer> Even though there's nothing actually WRONG with the core concept of socialism, and in fact it's more morally correct than a capitalist system that exploits the labor of the poor and middle class.
<Randomnerd> I'm aware -I'm a US History student. I spend a lot of time thinking about this sort of thing, though sometimes my conclusions are wrong.
<RawketLawnchair> Fleur, you gotta get somefink to eat.
<Kammerjunk> arrowtobroknee: Alright, it may be rounding up a bit, but hey, I wasn't in any of the Mane 6 rooms, nor in #bronstate.
<Kammerjunk> bronystate*
<emangamer> for example: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3bb06207-ea1b-482a-b63d-8faf806bb600.jpg
<Nyria> rainbowheaven: Oh your new!~ Wonderful more people to our family!~
<rainbowheaven> emangamer: Oki doki loki.
<Randomnerd> There's a crazy problem with the golden rule... some people don't expect be treated kindly.
<Fleur> RawketLawnchair we have been over this. I /cant/ get something to eat.
<RawketLawnchair> Bornstate?
<Darf14> I am the random guy here, so dont take me seriously here rainbowheaven
<RawketLawnchair> Oh. Well, that stinks, Fleur. I'm sorry to hear that.
<Nyria> Mmmm random~
<rainbowheaven> Nyria: Yeah, i was looking for a place to chat and here i am!
<Kammerjunk> Darf14: Which one of them?
<Ictiv> Asmalya: I think what you think under Capitalism is more like Monopolism, meaning corporation and other large economical forces. The thing is, capitalism is the definition of a whole type of economy. An economy where individuals are the ones making transaction for their own goals. Now most problems came in with Monopolism, but it was a completely natural evolution. And even long before there were lot of problems with the system (Ancient Gr
<Kammerjunk> Because pianos.
<RawketLawnchair> Nuts.
<Kammerjunk> CK|Mer: I'm living in a pretty socialistic country right now, and it's pretty nice here.
<Starflash> Ictiv y u so much textwall :O
<MadxHatter123> Kammerjunk: Yeah, I got one last question. Is there a way to go straght to bronystate and not have to go through one of the mane 6 rooms?
<Darf14> which one of who?
<Nyria> rainbowheaven: hehe~ I can relate~ But it's good to have you here~
*Fleur would love to eat something but has no moneys and wont mooch off of friends
<Nyria> Ictiv: Oh I thought we got over that subject~
<Starflash> As if anypony has enuf time for reading them before you post the next~
<Ictiv> Starflash: Because I either wall or spam. And spam is too easy to eat through
*Nyria le sigh~
<Kammerjunk> MadxHatter123: Well, you could get some software like mIRC or something.
<Randomnerd> I'm not sure how we can get politicians that aren't so easily bribed.
<Ictiv> Nyria: You got over it. Now shush and look the other way
*emangamer makes Fleur a sandwich
<Starflash> New spamroom #Ictiv >__>
<Starflash> Go there if ye want spam >_>
<emangamer> what kind of coldcuts would you like Fleur?
*Asmalya snuggles Nyria
<Gumri> Im going to go now people. Bye!
<emangamer> Starflash: inb4 no channel advertising
<Starflash> Cya Gumri~~
*Nyria snuggles Asmalya back~
<Kammerjunk> Sweet dreams, Gumri!
*Fleur noms on sandwich and wishes imaginary sandwiches were filling
<Randomnerd> Bribery is unavoidable, granted, but how the hay are you -bye, Gumri
<MadxHatter123> ah, eh, I'll just stick with going through the mane 6 rooms.
<Darf14> bye Gumri
<[SWAG]thehated5689> Hey bronies :D
<Darf14> hello SWAG
<Starflash> Lol. Although it's not a channel
<arrowtobroknee> hello
<Nyria> Hey Swag man~
<Starflash> Sorry mods, it's not a channel~
<RawketLawnchair> Swagger dagger.
*Ictiv is sad because no one wants to discuss interesting things.
<Randomnerd> How the Hay can you deal with people who seriously will sell out for a little bit of money/
<Nyria> It's fine Starflash~
<[SWAG]thehated5689> what interests u ictiv?
<MadxHatter123> Ictiv: interesting things, lets discuss them.
<Randomnerd> There are people that are threatened with DEATH that hold up better under pressure.
<emangamer> do you not have ANY food in your house?
<rainbowheaven> Has anypony seen a video called "Baked Bad Apple Pie" on youtube? if not u shuld check it out!
<emangamer> arrowtobroknee: IDK who you are but you will get slammed for that name.
<Ictiv> [SWAG]thehated5689: A lot of things actually, mostly things that if I mention people walk right past them
<Nyria> Rule 1 is to never talk about food, unless your giving it~
<Randomnerd> But somehow, an asshole folds at the first whiff of money :-/
<rainbowheaven> It's so AWESOME!*Rainbowdashsqueal*
<Starflash> Well, if anypony just only mentions a certain book, you've got Ictiv talkin for a couple of hours...
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: Too late.
<Fleur> Ictiv: http://youtu.be/co5ks1ZXrxw
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: you already did it?
<Kammerjunk> Starflash: Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy?
<Ictiv> A certain book?
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: No, but somepony did.
<[SWAG]thehated5689> arrowtobroknee? yep, kicked in a hearttbeat
<Kammerjunk> Wjth a
<Kammerjunk> With a trout.
<emangamer> Fleur: WHY would you?
<Starflash> There ^w^ Nice guess Kammerjunk
<arrowtobroknee> lol wut?
<Nyria> hehe that video~
<CK|Mer> Kammer: That's my point exactly though. We keep insisting that the capitalist motto is "best" but then we wonder why other socialist countries constantly poll higher than us in every category. :P
<emangamer> Fleur: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2044/
<Randomnerd> Or have for a few years... the "American" Dream is now the Danish Dream.
<[SWAG]thehated5689> im fairly sure page 42 in the hitchhikers guide has a way to disprove God
<CK|Mer> It's because capitalism in our country is so out of control that it's starting to collapse under its own weight.
<Nyria> Dem A's~
<Ictiv> Starflash: What book did you mean?
<Kammerjunk> That feel when your contacts are worn to the point where you can feel your eyeballs when you take them out.
<arrowtobroknee> ew
<rainbowheaven> So... omg.. i ran out of things to talk about!:O
<Randomnerd> You, Kammerjunk, live in the most socially-mobile country in the world now.
<Kammerjunk> [SWAG]thehated5689: Depends on which version.
<StinkomanFan> That feel when your eyes derp
<Starflash> What Kammer said. Hitchhiker's
<Darf14> dang, its hard to do work and chat at the same time 6_9
<Kammerjunk> Randomnerd: Really? That's nice.
<Nyria> rainbowheaven: When that happens just go with the flow ^^
<Nyria> Also there's always muffins to talk about~
<Randomnerd> lol
<Fleur> emangamer: win
*[SWAG]thehated5689 has the ultimate guide, all books in one, and it alone got me through middle school
<StinkomanFan> Hi everypony!
<rainbowheaven> Nyria: oki doki loki.....
<Kammerjunk> Nyria: My dog eats muffin forms ):
<[SWAG]thehated5689> hola sir
<emangamer> Fleur: seriously MLFW is one of the best sites for reaction pics...
<Nyria> What?~! It does!
<Starflash> Ohai StinkomanFan~
<Randomnerd> It's an abstract, but the problem is here in the states, we're probably going to have crappier lives than our parents.
<Nyria> Kammerjunk: You poor man~
<Kammerjunk> Then again, my dog eats everyting.
*Nyria hugs Kammerjunk ~
<Kammerjunk> everything*
<Kammerjunk> Really.

<Ictiv> Starflash: I Can't talk a lot about Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's not worth talking about. If you needto talk about it, you obviously didn't read it because you'd know it is something that envelops you in a cuddling warm towel and becomes one with you
<StinkomanFan> My dog once ate my dog
<Sumica> 00,10Have fun all, Time to go earn more cash for ponies.
<Kammerjunk> StinkomanFan: wat
<Ictiv> (Text wall again)
<Darf14> huh, never heard of that site, better check it out
<rainbowheaven> Muuuuffiiinnnnssss...... so sweet and tast- oh wait wrong song...:P
<emangamer> Sumica: how? and can I join?
<Randomnerd> Bye, Sumica
<Kammerjunk> Sumica: Cash is for the weak.

<Sumica> 00,10It's called a job emangamer =p
<Starflash> Although this time the textwall was interesting enough to read, Ictiv XD
<StinkomanFan> My dog ate my dog, what's so complex about that?
<Starflash> And you DO talk about it A LOT.
<emangamer> Sumica: oh I thought you ment make money OFF OF ponies
<Ictiv> But seriously I can talk a lot about a few things... For example: Why isn't Time Travel DEFINETLY impossible!
<Randomnerd> But yeah, we hate "Socialism", so fuck that shit, right? :-/
<Nyria> Oh lord not time travel~
<Ictiv> emangamer knows half of it
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: BUT! Do you know where your towel is?
<Ictiv> but not the interesting part
*Nyria will step out of the chat because of that subject~
<Starflash> Because stuff can go faster than light! Yay particles~
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: As I said before: I AM a towel
<arrowtobroknee> I have way too many towels
*Starflash follows Nyria though
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: wat
<Sumica> 00,10Oh that's easy emangamer draw them well or draw them sexy then charge to draw.
<StinkomanFan> Hey Randomnerd, did you like the story I gave ya yesterday?
<Kammerjunk> I know where my towel is.
<Kammerjunk> But I'm still not as hoopy as Zaphod.
<Randomnerd> It's interesting!
<rainbowheaven> Ictiv: well i'm sure doctor whooves knows wut to do...
<emangamer> rainbowheaven: not really you had the right song but the wrong language: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Je4AlkeFY
<Kammerjunk> You sass Zaphod? Now there's a hoopy frood who knows where his towel is.
<Asmalya> Hey Nyria step into my tardis to espace talk about time travel!
<Ictiv> rainbowheaven: har har
<Asmalya> *grin*
<Kammerjunk> And Ford, too.
<MadxHatter1234> quick! I need to know how to sign in with my registered name before I am disconnected again! (Is MadxHatter123 by the way)
<StinkomanFan> I miss Doctor Whoof
<Nyria> Sure Asmalya~
<arrowtobroknee> I love foreign ponies
<emangamer> Sumica: but..."sexy" ponies are forbidden around these parts
<emangamer> arrowtobroknee: we all do
*Nyria walks in hoping to not talk about timetravel~
<Nyria> hopeing*
<arrowtobroknee> they're better than us
<emangamer> the russian cupcakes song is AMAZING
<StinkomanFan> Has Marty McFly ever crashed into the TARDIS?
<Sumica> 00,10indeed they are. But there are able to roam free in others.

<Saturn> 8,1wellp, i went outside tonight to try and catch some aurorae
<Saturn> 8,1couldn't see shit.
<StinkomanFan> What shirt?
<Ictiv> [SWAG]thehated5689: See what I mean? I put on an interesting topic: Time Travel! Who DIDN'T spend atleast 5 years of their life wondering about such a thing?... I put it up, Woosh it goes by with first breeze
<Randomnerd> Agh.
<MadxHatter1234> Kammerjunk: Ok, thanks.
<StinkomanFan> And what's wrong with Tara?
<Kammerjunk> Russian is absolutely brilliant.
<Kammerjunk> Raelly.
<Kammerjunk> Really*
<Darf14> French suits Rarity
<StinkomanFan> It's a nice Injoke
<emangamer> arrowtobroknee: You want to hear Fancy? THIIIS IS﻿ FAAANCYYY!
<Kammerjunk> I want to learn Russian, but no one else around me doesl
<Kammerjunk> does*

<emangamer> Kammerjunk: where I live there are several russians living here
<Kammerjunk> You want to hear fancy? I'll give you fancy!
<Randomnerd> I guess? I mean, it's a reference, so I got it.

<Kammerjunk> This is fancy! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrIbrYROLig

<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02So, what's new everypony?
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: that voice is SOOOOOOO sexy
<[SWAG]thehated5689> wait... arrowtobroknee THEY HAVE IT ON NICK JR. THERE??? NOT FAIR
<emangamer> I would go gay for that voice
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: I would marry that voice.
<Randomnerd> Lots of russians on the south shore, yeah.
<Darf14> Every Pony now speaks fancy
<MadxHatter1234> Kammerjunk: *facehoof* I forgot to write down what you said.
<Ictiv> SuperBrony64|AFK: No one wants to talk Time Travel and Science with me :(
<StinkomanFan> Behold! The capabilities of modern technology!
<Ingwaz> yo SuperBrony64|AFK
<emangamer> do you guys want to hear my newest ringtone?
<Nyria> SuperBrony64|AFK: Nothing really~ But thanks for asking~
<Darf14> sure

<MadxHatter1234> arrowtobroknee: Lucky, I have to watch it online.
<emangamer> Saturn: read the top comments
<MadxHatter1234> Kammerjunk: Thanks.
<Kammerjunk> No problem.
<TrixieMuffin> I usually travel in time , when i dont im late
<Randomnerd> Well, I'm off, meeting a lady, so this should be hilarious.
<StinkomanFan> I used to talk about it Ictiv... Then my grandfather became my uncle
<Darf14> hmm..... I wonder what Derpys voice sounds like in Fancy
<Randomnerd> -ly awful. :(
<Kammerjunk> TrixieMuffin: Well, of course -you- can travel in time, being second best pony and all.
<Ictiv> StinkomanFan: dot dot dot
<Saturn> 8,1"It's like...
<Saturn> 8,1someone distilled the most interesting man in the world's essence, let it age in the finest oak barrels for 150 years, and bottled it in crystallized testosterone. They then took that, and made the darkest stout in recent history, which was fortified with above mentioned concoction. ﻿ The resulting brew was then served with a perfectly cooked Filet Mignon, covered in a reduction of that fortified stout...
<Kammerjunk> Also, being great and powerful.
<Saturn> 8,1And figured out how to make something sound like that."
<arrowtobroknee> oh lawdy, I want to hear a foreign derpy
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: That comment deserves a thumbs up.
<Saturn> 8,1indeed
<rainbowheaven> Oh god. I just found the Japanese versian of giggle at the ghosties...:O
<[SWAG]thehated5689> that sounds deliciously amazing
<Kammerjunk> rainbowheaven: wat
<rainbowheaven> Kammerjunk: Yeah...
<arrowtobroknee> if derpy is canon now, does that mean hasbro has licence to make derpy dolls?
<Randomnerd> Dat sexy French Flutterguy.
<Darf14> maybe
<emangamer> hey SuperBrony64|AFK do you care to hear my newest MLP ringtone?
<StinkomanFan> Derpy should derpi derpi
<Randomnerd> Rule63 Fluttershy under poison joke would sound like Kathleen Turner, lol
<Ictiv> Hasbro had lincense to make derpy dolls until now too
<Randomnerd> Okay, bye all.
<StinkomanFan> Bye~
<Kammerjunk> See you, Randomnerd.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02yup, I find talk about other dimensions interesting ^_^
<Kammerjunk> I don't.
<Kammerjunk> It just ends up confusing me.
<Brawny> hey everypony
<Kammerjunk> There's a reason I don't question time travel logic in films.
<[SWAG]thehated5689> hi brawny
<TrixieMuffin> Yeah that 38th dimension sure is something right ?
<RawketLawnchair> Alright.
<arrowtobroknee> hi brawn
<Nyria> ta ta rand- aw...
<Kammerjunk> I don't want to spend the next 5 weeks figuring it all out.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I think I travel through alt. dimensions in ym dreams
<RawketLawnchair> I am going to go to class now.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02I wanna hear it! But share it with me when i get home later.
<StinkomanFan> In another dimensions we all have ponies :s
<Kammerjunk> Avê, Brawny. Quid agis?
<RawketLawnchair> I'll be back in about, ah, 3 and a half hours.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Hey Brawny
<RawketLawnchair> Give or take, of course! Ha ha.
<emangamer> who here likes EPIC bass brops?
<RawketLawnchair> Good bye.
<Saturn> 8,1SuperBrony64|AFK: by other dimensions, i presume you're not talking about additional spatial dimensions required by string theory?
<Kammerjunk> SaxyPretender: I saw a film about that recently.
<Kammerjunk> Insidious.
<Nyria> I think every huamn thought turns into a dimensions~
<Nyria> human*
<Brawny> trippy
<[SWAG]thehated5689> does everypony have a dream and know its a dream, or tottaly go with said dream, forgetting everything else but what they dream tlls you?
<TrixieMuffin> are you confusing dimensions with alternate realities ?
<StinkomanFan> Oh good Nyria
<emangamer> Nyria: that is a loose interpritation on a certain theory yes
<StinkomanFan> I'm not the only one
<emangamer> I can explain it to you Nyria if you wish
<rainbowheaven> ............. :P
<arrowtobroknee> I don't know what the buck is going on
<Kammerjunk> [SWAG]thehated5689: Well, I once had this really trippy dream which I knew was a dream.
<Nyria> Oh ... I can't wait until I'm older emangamer, but thanks ^^
<Saturn> 8,1okay guys, i think it's time for some hard science
<Nyria> How hard?~
<[SWAG]thehated5689> cake?
<Saturn> 8,1particle physics
<StinkomanFan> You're gonna stream Mythbusters?
<Nyria> Oh...
<arrowtobroknee> go on...
<Darf14> my gosh... SCIENCE!
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02I talk about whatever dimension I want ^_^ I'm a paladin, i hit peps wit mah stik :3
<[SWAG]thehated5689> and cake?
<Nyria> I'll try to understand~
<arrowtobroknee> For Science
<Saturn> 8,1okay, so y'all know what atoms are, yes?
<arrowtobroknee> yeah
<Darf14> yes
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Y
<StinkomanFan> This place is going to fast
<TrixieMuffin> Bump uglies.....i mean Smite Evil
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Yup*
<DashWithRainbows> SuperBrony64|AFK i have no idea what you are talking about. Into the washing freezer you go.
<Shizuka> 13Science!
<StinkomanFan> I'm going ot the moon
<[SWAG]thehated5689> there can be no science without cake
<Kammerjunk> It was like, I was in the clouds, and I could see large cloud statues in the distance. I went north (How I knew it was north, I shall never know) and suddenly, the cloud canyon gets flooded. There's an alligator, so I kick it.
<Kammerjunk> Then I woke up.
<Kammerjunk> It was really weird.
<Mad> Kammerjunk: Ugh, this is so confusing. Where do I type that stuff in?
*DashWithRainbows throws SuperBrony64|AFK into washing freezer and puts in fabric softener
<Darf14> Science = Robot Overlords
<[SWAG]thehated5689> that sounds amazing kammerjunk
<Brawny> mfw when I get a 50 second song on my pandora
<Kammerjunk> Mad: Just in the chat.
<Saturn> 8,1so you can divide atoms into protons, neutrons and electrons. of these, electrons are kinda weird, in that they have negligible mass, but a negative charge
<Brawny> from The Killers' Sam's Town
<StinkomanFan> So... how about we discuss more theories on ponies?
<arrowtobroknee> I for one welcome the robot overloads
<Kammerjunk> [SWAG]thehated5689: And I wasn't even sick or anything.
<Saturn> 8,1protons and neutrons have equal mass, but protons are positively charged
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Electrons are elementary particles.
<rainbowheaven> Derp.... :P
<Shizuka> 13ponies should poni pony
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Protons are made up of quarks
<Saturn> 8,1SuperBrony64|AFK: indeed
<[SWAG]thehated5689> kammerjunk: i want to have a dream like that
<arrowtobroknee> and neutons are neutral
<Saturn> 8,1SuperBrony64|AFK: stop ninjaing me :P
<prince-dari> Why are we talking about chemistry?
<Darf14> why not?
<Kammerjunk> No clue.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02AQuarks have different flavours ^_^
<arrowtobroknee> It's physics
<TrixieMuffin> wearent its physics
<[SWAG]thehated5689> hmmm.... yes
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Like banana flavoured :P
<Saturn> 8,1pah, okay, i'll not even go into quantum mechanics then
<StinkomanFan> I beleive that each of the mane six have deep seated issues
*Saturn 8,1storms off in a huff
<Darf14> :(
<arrowtobroknee> but I was having fun
<StinkomanFan> Also Rarity and Sweetie Belle have undergone abuse
<rainbowheaven> SuperBrony64|AFK: :O
<Saturn> 8,1but end of the day, leptons and quarks are actually vibrating strings in 9 or more spatial dimensions.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02I love quantum mechanics ^_^
<[SWAG]thehated5689> how so?
<Kammerjunk> I don't either.
<rainbowheaven> Dang ads....
<Kammerjunk> They confuse me in the end.
<MadxHatter123> Ok, I finally figured this thing out. I'm good.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Protons consist of two down quarks and one up quark, the oppisite is true for neutrons
<Saturn> 8,1acutlaly, i really liked that idea of streaming mythbusters
<Kammerjunk> Oh, good
<Saturn> 8,1who's streaming?
<[SWAG]thehated5689> like what signs from Sweetie and Rarity show signs of abuse?
<Darf14> gah! What am I doing?! Im studying math right now and im learning science DX *goes back to math book*
<StinkomanFan> Well, have you seen how Sweetie acted when AJ got upset with Apple Bloom?
<emangamer> hey Nyria
<rainbowheaven> Darf14: hah.
<Nyria> Yes eman?~
<MadxHatter123> You know, I never would have found this place if it wasn't for the awesomeness that is Derpy.
<TrixieMuffin> Have you seen Mr.Heisenberg around here somewhere ? A: I can tell you where he is , but not at what speed he travels!
<[SWAG]thehated5689> oh yeah, i remember
<rainbowheaven> MadxHatter123: You are so right! same for me!
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02But the biggest topic that interests me is the quantum foam, the smallest size possible to still make any physical sense.
<emangamer> SuperBrony64|AFK: isnt that just an idea? quarks are just imaginary unless you accept the string theory correst?
<rainbowheaven> DEEEERRRRPPPPYYYY
<rainbowheaven> :P
<arrowtobroknee> yes, derpy
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Quarks are proven
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02The string theory exists at the quantum foam level
<[SWAG]thehated5689> but what about rarity, she seems more undisciplined than abused to me
<Saturn> 8,1SuperBrony64|AFK: quantum foam \o/
<StinkomanFan> And Rarity doesn't seem pleased seeing her parents at her house...
<Shizuka> 13quantum..foam?
<StinkomanFan> *didn't
<Shizuka> 13a challenger for my foam haddock approaches
<MadxHatter123> Yeah, i found a video on youtube that showed the reactions of you guys to her part in the recent episode. Which was awesome by the way.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Its the point where the heisnenberg uncertainty principle takes place
<Saturn> 8,1i like fermionic condensate
<rainbowheaven> Derpy is the silliest yet most popular pony evar!
<TrixieMuffin> Quantum Foam Party
<rainbowheaven> I think
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02It's where matter can come into existence and disappear without breaking any physical laws
<Brawny> Guys, the spanish word for foot is pie
<arrowtobroknee> themoreyouknow.png
<emangamer> SuperBrony64|AFK: can we stop talkign about quantum mechanics please?
<rainbowheaven> Okay what are you nerds talking bout? no offense...
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Awww...
<Starflash> emangamer it's interesting :O
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: I can't see SB's messages anyway.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02;A;
<arrowtobroknee> lol nerds
<Kammerjunk> XChat doesn't like colour.
<MadxHatter123> rainbowheaven: I agree, after Fluttershy and Pinkie of course.
<[SWAG]thehated5689> it could be something along the lines of rarity being neglected by her parents and taking out on sweeite bell, that what i heard around the interwebs anyways
<emangamer> Starflash: it is interesting but it is too lengthy for this chat
<Saturn> 8,1SuperBrony64|AFK: damnit, now i want to go on about van der waals force and using meta-materials to create a simulation of rindler space
<Starflash> hmmyeah
<[SWAG]thehated5689> but that would make sense
<emangamer> SuperBrony64|AFK: I'm sorry. I love physics but it is too wordy for this chat
<rainbowheaven> MadxHatter123: True. Pikie is just Hyper and flutytershy is the tnder loving pony we all know and love
<Nyria|Puzzles> I need to solve a puzzle be back later~
<rainbowheaven> *Pinkie.
*emangamer hugs SuperBrony64|AFK "I'm sorry"
<Saturn> 8,1*cough*#science*cough*
<Starflash> Well I don't know crap about it anyways, since I've only got a simple degree in universal science -w-
<Darf14> ok... 4+6= ...atomic energy...6_9
<[SWAG]thehated5689> sorry, im not the best person to hold an intellectual conversation with, i usually just get lost in thought
<rainbowheaven> I can't believe i spelled her name wrong! derp...
<StinkomanFan> IDK Sweetie seems content with staying with Rarity. Overjoyed even
<MadxHatter123> rainbowheaven: Yep, that's why fluttershy is the main focus of my first mlp fan fic
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Big one last note, elementary particles are particles of matter that dont have any known materials that make up their form. essentially, electrons are just that, electrons. Same with neutrinos as well.
<CannonsMADE> SOO
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02I'm done ^_^
<[SWAG]thehated5689> yesh?
<Kammerjunk> TL;DR?
<arrowtobroknee> I have learned so much
<Saturn> 8,1basically, fermions (quarks, leptons and neutrinos) are fundamental
<MadxHatter123> rainbowheaven: You spelled fluttershy wrong too.
<Saturn> 8,1as are photons, gluons and bosons
<emangamer> SuperBrony64|AFK: who would win in a fight Thomas Edison, or Nick Tesla
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: I couldn't help reading "feminons" there.
<Brawny> I thought you were into bioengineering, superbrony
<Brawny> Not magic
<Kammerjunk> Too much 4chan for me.
<rainbowheaven> Did I? :O no!
<MadxHatter123> yeah
<arrowtobroknee> Edison made tesla's experiments possible
<Saturn> 8,1Kammerjunk: the elementary particle of women?
<StinkomanFan> It just seems that there parents seem a bit... off to me
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Sure, why not.
<emangamer> dat science
<[SWAG]thehated5689> yeah that would make sense, but there was this one thing about sweetie bell always wanting to be up to rarities standards and doing everything she can to be what she wants
<arrowtobroknee> dat mass
<[SWAG]thehated5689> sparticles
<emangamer> http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&size=l&tid=18900066

<rainbowheaven> :D
<emangamer> arrowtobroknee: http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y8/xmanooo7/1237146724487.jpg
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Fermions are best elementary particles.
<emangamer> rainbowheaven: false
<emangamer> pinkie pie is best pony
<StinkomanFan> True, Sweetie seems to want Rarity to like her
<Darf14> Science, even if it will doom us all we really need it
<arrowtobroknee> full winter wrap up i italian
<arrowtobroknee> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOdx3sSR8-M&feature=related
<emangamer> I can scientifically prove pinkie pie is best pony
<rainbowheaven> emangamer: you've got a point, but like i said rainbow is my fav. just my opinion...
<arrowtobroknee> she has best voice
<StinkomanFan> But I doubt abuse would lead to obsession of being like Rarity
<emangamer> rainbowheaven: science proves that it should be everyponies favorite pony
<rainbowheaven> emangamer: how? PROVE IT:[
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02It's an important and popular fact that things aren't always what they seem...
<[SWAG]thehated5689> not being rarity herself, but seeing that the reason she is abusing her is that she is evreything to her parents, but nothing in rarities eyes, and wants to be something, wants to be accepted
<Shizuka> 13space is big, really big
<emangamer> rainbowheaven: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6QdiP5LYdeE/Tt73-BBZkYI/AAAAAAAAB58/M73rLzHlG6k/s1600/PP.png Scientifically proven
<emangamer> Shizuka: no...space is infinate, really infinate
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02You just wont beileve how mind boggling big it is
<Shizuka> 13and so on
<Darf14> Science cant even handle Pinkie Pie
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02As stated in the introduction to the guide :3
<arrowtobroknee> the 4th wall couldn't take her
<emangamer> rainbowheaven: told you :P
<[SWAG]thehated5689> we where litterally just talking about the guide
<rainbowheaven> :O OMG UR RIGHT! OKay then, dash is my secong fav pony. Pinkie just took her place..
<emangamer> <3
<StinkomanFan> Ah, so she's the lesser child then, unlike with the Apple Family where they're all loved equally
<emangamer> I will now break you heart, Dash is my 5th favorite pony
<rainbowheaven> *second
<[SWAG]thehated5689> i guess so
<Darf14> For me Dash and Pinkie pie are my favorite ponies
<Kammerjunk> Twilight is still my favourite pony, followed closely by Trixie.
<Kammerjunk> And thus, Twixie is my favourite ship.
<emangamer> Darf14: that contradicts the very definition of favorite
<rainbowheaven> Darf14: AWESOME;)
<Darf14> sorry, I cant decide
*emangamer slapps Kammerjunk HARD so hard that he breaks a table by falling on it
<StinkomanFan> So, the Apple Family have some interesting theories in and of themselves
<Kammerjunk> D:
<arrowtobroknee> ouch
<Kammerjunk> How does that even make sense?
<[SWAG]thehated5689> brb dog shasing dog
<StinkomanFan> Big Mac alone would be worth a short essay
<StinkomanFan> k
<DashWithRainbows> emangamer My table!
<Kammerjunk> I just like Trixie D:
<emangamer> sorry DashWithRainbows but he deserved it

<Woonanon> Who doesn't like Trixie?
<emangamer> Trixie is second worst pony next to Twist
<rainbowheaven> :D omg!
<DashWithRainbows> No. You no breaky my table.
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: WHY do you hate Twist?
<TrixieMuffin> I like you too!
<rainbowheaven> Who's Twist?
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: because she is a bitch
<Woonanon> Trixie is best pony
*DashWithRainbows supa flips tables to emangamer's face that they break the sound barrier
<Kammerjunk> It's not like she didn't want to be Applebloom's friend after she got her cutie mark.
<Kammerjunk> She just happened to get her.
<emangamer> rainbowheaven: the pony that was applebloom's friend
<Darf14> twist was that one pony from the cutie mark episode
<rainbowheaven> Decription?
<emangamer> DashWithRainbows: MY teble...
<MadxHatter123> Kammerjunk: Someone hates Twist! They have no soul.
*emangamer strangles Darf14
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02The pan galactic gargle blaster is highly regarded as the most alcoholic drink ever created. its effects are similar to that of having your brains smashed together with a lemon wrapped around a gold brick
<rainbowheaven> WAIT!
<Darf14> URK! X_X
<[SWAG]thehated5689> what kind of theories are u thinking of, i havent heard much about AJ
<DashWithRainbows> Sorry, but all tables in chat are mine since i spawned them and flipped them mahself
*emangamer streals SuperBrony64|AFK's gold brick
<rainbowheaven> is she the filly with the glasses?
<Woonanon> Yes
<emangamer> rainbowheaven: the BITCH with the glasses? yes
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: Applebloom, however, didn't want to be Twist's friend after Twist got her cutie mark.
<Woonanon> The one with the lispth
<Kammerjunk> So it's Applebloom's fault.
<rainbowheaven> :O :D
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: there is nothing in the episode saying that
<emangamer> and besides thats not why I hate her
<[SWAG]thehated5689> you cant forget the god disproving babble fish
<emangamer> I just do...shes a bitch
<StinkomanFan> Well, the 4 of them togher have plenty
<arrowtobroknee> the babel fish knoes all
<arrowtobroknee> *knows
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: So you hate her, but you don't know why?
<Darf14> you must really hate ...err.... that one pony that I will not name again.... please dont hurt me :(
<emangamer> http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Who+is+god%3F
<Saturn> 8,1nopony is streaming currently?
<[SWAG]thehated5689> what ones do think are the most likely or abstract
<[SWAG]thehated5689> nope
<Kammerjunk> That's like hating socialism because you hate socialism.
<Woonanon> Who actually likes Twist anyway?
<MadxHatter123> emangamer: you sir, have no soul. How can you hate the adorkable filly that is Twist!?
<Kammerjunk> Woonanon: Well, I certainly don't have anything against her.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Lol, I wonder if i could try streaming remotely from my iPad...
<StinkomanFan> Big Mac used to be a type of hero
<emangamer> I will link it again becuase it is so funny
<emangamer> http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Who+is+god%3F
<StinkomanFan> And then retired
<Woonanon> I don't hate her, but I don't much care for her either.
<[SWAG]thehated5689> a hero?
<MadxHatter123> Woonanon: I DO! She not my faviorite, but I still think she's awesome
<StinkomanFan> Like a Superhero
<Darf14> lol, thats funny :D
<Kammerjunk> Woonanon: But thinking that she is a bitch without explaining why beyond "I just do" doesn't make any sense.
*emangamer flipps Kammerjunk over a table
<Woonanon> I don't think she is a bitch.
<Kammerjunk> No, emangamer does.
<[SWAG]thehated5689> can you elaborate on it?
<arrowtobroknee> who's a bitch?
<Kammerjunk> At least I can understand why some would hate Trixie.
<Darf14> dont ask
<Kammerjunk> Though I still think they're a tad vocal about it.
<StinkomanFan> Well, in fanon he's brave, dashing, strong, fast, smart
<Woonanon> The grrrrreat and powerful Trrrrrixie is a great pony.
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: Do you want me to hate you forever?
*emangamer slapps Woonanon
<Woonanon> Her Voice is the best.
<emangamer> dont EVER say that again
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: Dearly, my Frank, I don't damn a give.
<Kammerjunk> I.
<Kammerjunk> Love.
<Kammerjunk> Trixie.
<rainbowheaven> We still talking bout twist?
<[SWAG]thehated5689> mmhmmm
*emangamer stabbs Kammerjunk
*emangamer several times
<Woonanon> Trixie's voice is orgasmic
<Kammerjunk> ^
<arrowtobroknee> lol
<Darf14> *backe away from emangamer* 0_o
<emangamer> I am rage quitting
<StinkomanFan> And Lesson Zero confirmed a good 3/5ths of those
<Kammerjunk> Okay.
<Kammerjunk> Have fun.
<emangamer> due to all of this trixie and bitch love
<Kammerjunk> So much for tolerance, eh?
<emangamer> but seriously I must depart
<[SWAG]thehated5689> he does show the charecterstics of being a hero, it just seems to me like he wouldnt have enough screen time to portray a huge backstory
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: I can only tolerate so much
<Darf14> err....bye...
<emangamer> bye everypony <3
<rainbowheaven> emangamer: Bye...:(
<arrowtobroknee> bye
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: Suit yourself.
<Woonanon> Bye
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Bai emangamer!
<[SWAG]thehated5689> besides his love of the doll, which could show something
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: I think you are taking this conversation a little too seriously
*emangamer gives SuperBrony64|AFK a quick smack on the flank
<MadxHatter123> emangamer: see you, soulless demon
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: I am?
<RAWRity> ah, emangamer you leavin?
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02O___o
<emangamer> RAWRity: <3
<RAWRity> also, emangamer, have you read Mod 3?
<Kammerjunk> I'm not the one calling Twist a bitch just beacuse, though.
<Kammerjunk> because*
<arrowtobroknee> I wonder if the ponies will ever get welsh dubs...
<emangamer> RAWRity: you should show off your epic pony meme to rainbowheaven our new member
<Woonanon> There needs to be more Trixie in season 2.
<emangamer> RAWRity: and no I havent
<Kammerjunk> Woonanon: I agree.
*emangamer glares at Woonanon with his hand ready to slap
<rainbowheaven> Wuh. 6_9
<arrowtobroknee> trixe should at least get a mention
<RAWRity> emangamer: http://lossthief.deviantart.com/art/Mod3rator-281057533
<Woonanon> I stand by my opinion.
<emangamer> rainbowheaven: RAWRity is the other ponymeme guy
<StinkomanFan> I like the idea of Big Mac being a retired superhero. Like Watchmen or The Incredibles or something
<arrowtobroknee> or the bronies should push for her, like derpy
<rainbowheaven> Oh... well okay then..
<Kammerjunk> I don't like Trixie because I think her personality is likable, I like her because she is a good character for a show.
*emangamer hugs RAWRity "I am off. I shall read your then bye <3"
<RAWRity> hmm, he seemed very happy.
<[SWAG]thehated5689> i see it now
<Woonanon> I just love her voice, and she is quite unique
<Kammerjunk> Quite
<Kammerjunk> RAWRity: He did?
*Ictiv spins magic staff then is envlepoped in a teal bubble of sparkling light.

<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: what with all the tildes and hearts and whatnot.
<MadxHatter123> Ictiv: BYE!!
<Darf14> bye Ictiv, stay on that yellow brick road
<[SWAG]thehated5689> im gonna laugh if some of this turns out to be true

<Asmalya> Spoiler? uh...
<emangamer> RAWRity: but he IS too british
<Asmalya> okais...

<MadxHatter123> *takes bite* OH MY CELESTIA!! This stuff is awesome!
<Cy> Lol.
<RAWRity> Asmalya: posting anything that hints about a future episode technically counts as a spoiler, and we try to avoid those here.
<emangamer> RAWRity: you continually make fun of michale bay dont you?
<MidnightBolt> I also hear that episode 16 has ponies
<[SWAG]thehated5689> that would be amazing
<arrowtobroknee> duh
<rainbowheaven> Double rainbow Syndrome :D
<arrowtobroknee> lol
<RAWRity> As a rule of thumb, don't talk about an episode until a couple hours after it's aired.
<Kammerjunk> MidnightBolt: No way.

<Kammerjunk> You're kiddin.

<RAWRity> DashWithRainbows: stop taking it out of context!

<[SWAG]thehated5689> because Tahiti dosent have a pony related pun in it
<DashWithRainbows> i didnt say i was bro.
<DashWithRainbows> i was merely trying to process what was goin' on.
<StickySyrup> DashWithRainbows: hello =)
<Gumri> Why is the stream not up? i don't understand.
<DashWithRainbows> Hey...StickySyrup...

<Nyria> emangamer: I tired~
<StickySyrup> lol better than terriorism
<Brawny> Fox news like picking on things like Bronies because the majority of their viewerbase is 40-somethings who think the internet is voodoo and witchcraft and anything different from themselves is bad and scary.
<emangamer> Nyria: which ones?
<Brawny> Agreed?
<RAWRity> emangamer: sure let's go with that.

<StinkomanFan> Well, at every level or two you get to choose something that adds something to your charactor
<Nyria> ta ta IshBestKitty ~
*IshBestKitty scratches up StickySyrups sofa very badly
<otakon> Bad IshBestKitty
<Gumri> They are more based on a particular skill e.g: a marksman perk is to slow down time when you aim
<Ziltoid> lol
*IshBestKitty purrs and rubs against Nyria
<Sammy> you dead
<Nyria> Awww... Adorable~
*StickySyrup oh well,

<otakon> that's better
*StickySyrup SQUEEEE
<fluttercry> 05,15and a chest plate
<otakon> finally!
<Gumri> Why is he even trying to free the dude?
<Nyria> And some earings~
<icelordcryo> i have dragon stuff lol
*Scoot-Scootaloo realizes he can't afoord this game yet...
<Nyria> I think~
*rainbowheaven snuggles with IshBestKitty
<otakon> Gumri: for the hell of it
<StinkomanFan> Ah, so it's not "50% damage with fire related weapons" sort of things
*IshBestKitty purrs and rubs against rainbowheaven
<Gumri> Daedric armour is better than dragon
<Gumri> no
<icelordcryo> but dragon is easyer to get
<Nyria> Ooo~
*rainbowheaven gives IshBestKitty catnip
<otakon> true Gumri but Dragon is easier to get
<Nyria> yay~!
*IshBestKitty noms catnip
<Ziltoid> Not if you wear light armor
<icelordcryo> cant find a single dreadra
<fluttercry> 05,15Yeah that pissed me off. I spent all this time maxing out dragon armor and it's not that great
<RainbowcrashNBurn> what shout was that?
*IshBestKitty purrs and rubs against everything
<fluttercry> 05,15also daedric stuff is easy to get if you know where to farm hearts and ebony
<otakon> use you ranged spell!
<Nyria> This feels just like fallout~ without guns~
*rainbowheaven cleans up IshBestKitty's fur
*Gumri gives IshBestKitty a slap for making the place stink
<IshBestKitty> mew :'(
<StinkomanFan> Alright, I'm going to have to check it out
<StickySyrup> what?
<otakon> fluttercry: I like it, but arent' the pieces randomly generated and the hearts and ebony fairly rare?
<Phase4> Nyria: was just thinking that, only seen a lets play though
*rainbowheaven slaps gumri for smacking IshBestKitty
<Ziltoid> you can just buy ebony
<LadyCanary> D: Dont hurt the kitty Gumri
<Nyria> Phase4: Same here as well~ I want the game~
*IshBestKitty purrs and rubs against rainbowheaven
<Gumri> I found the PC port for Skyrim to be really terrible
<Ziltoid> hearts seem like the hard part
<fluttercry> 05,15Hearts are always at Mehrunes Dagon's shrine. Ebony can be found in a mine and bought. that's all you need
<Brawny> my character is stealth
<IshBestKitty> meow
<Brawny> cause x36 sneak attacks are fun
<icelordcryo> my character is a tank
*rainbowheaven soothes IshBestKitty and yells at Gumri
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 more rank 1/2/3/4/5 of the first bow skill can give you 20/40/60/80/100% extra bow damage, skill 2 lets you zoom in with the bow, 3 slows time
<Nyria> I love fist fighting~!
<StickySyrup> Ziltoid: if you go to the highest point in the game... there is a ore vien with a enchanted pix axe that has ebony ore
*IshBestKitty turns back into IshBestPony and knocks Gumri out
<Nyria> All Wrek needs now is a handel bar mustache~!
<Brawny> it's also a reference to notch
<Brawny> the maker of minecraft
<Ziltoid> oh yeah I read about that
<StinkomanFan> Ah, so they're preset
<icelordcryo> i haz the notched pickax
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm still skeptical about that
<kirzstryfe> Wrek, we have apony with a question about the skill trees, can you pull it up when you get a chance?
<icelordcryo> its fun
<Ziltoid> Need to go back
<MakerDusk> MakerDusk is best maker.
<Dken2021> oh the nothed pickaxe?
<IshBestPony> bai everypony
<Gumri> oh shit a kitty just knocked me out! how'd that happen :D
<Dken2021> bye ba IshBestPony
*rainbowheaven cheers IshBestPony on. "Go IshBestPony!
<Brawny> fluttercry, bethesda had a whole copyright debacle with notch over one of his games
<Gumri> exactly
<Nyria> ta ta IshBestPony ~
<StickySyrup> bye IshBestPony
<Brawny> it makes sense that they would reference him
<fluttercry> 05,15yeah i know. so why give him a shout out
*IshBestPony hugs Dken2021 and rainbowheaven and Nyria and StickySyrup
<Brawny> maybe it's a srt of apology?
<Brawny> sort*
*Nyria hugs IshBestPony back~
<Brawny> bethesda has always been a pretty cool company
<Gumri> Why not is a better question
<rainbowheaven> Aw thanks. *HUGS Back*
<Nyria> /me
*Dken2021 also hugs IshBestPony back
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 each tree affects the different skill areas, with some of the talents only accessible when you level it up enough
<StinkomanFan> So... what's Wrek trying to do here? Free a slave without killing it?
<Gumri> Oh look it's IshBestPony again :)

<StickySyrup> rainbowheaven: he has his computer on in class? I dunno
<StinkomanFan> 18
<Nyria> Hey LunaTheBeloved ~
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Guys, I have to be honest with you, I don't feel 100% right now. I have to take a nap to refresh my head. Today has been just a long day...
<Gumri> oh lol im not even that yet
<Nyria> Oh lord, Scoot-Scootaloo do what you must. All I have to say is get better and that we care~
<LadyCanary> Go ahead Scoot-Scootaloo <3
*StickySyrup offers Scoot-Scootaloo some hot choclate
<LadyCanary> Rest your head
<rainbowheaven> StickySyrup: Okay. I'm not allowed personal technology in my school, so..
<LunaTheBeloved> Hi Nyria, bye Scoot-Scootaloo
<StickySyrup> rainbowheaven: :) no matter
<rainbowheaven> Okay~!
<otakon> did he sell his loot yet?
<StickySyrup> rainbowheaven: what kind of school is it?
<fluttercry> 05,15Why the tilde! I don't understand!
<Gumri> I know a kid who is 12 and watches MLP, does he count as a brony?
<Nyria> Because it's classy~
<rainbowheaven> High School
<otakon> that was close
<StickySyrup> rainbowheaven: kl
<fluttercry> 05,15Well there's your problem rainbowheaven
<Gumri> like a boss
<StinkomanFan> So... how does leving work here? Standard kill and get XP?
<StickySyrup> hurry up and kill a dragon so u can Fus people around
<StinkomanFan> Kill certain ways and get xp for ranks?
<rainbowheaven> Yeah. But my older bro is a senior and he's allowed to bring his laptop!:'(
<Gumri> every successful hit
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 levelling the different skills gets you overall levels
<Nyria> Wait somebody is using 'u' as a word?~ Oh... right where on the internet~
<StinkomanFan> Oh so you can level up mid battle
<Dermathil> who be playan?
<Nyria> Wrek: ~
<Nyria> I mean
<Nyria> Wrek is~
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 use 1-handed weapons, raise 1-hand skill, bows->bows, fire magic-> destruction magic, etc
<Dermathil> hey
<StickySyrup> rainbowheaven: :'(
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 it's pretty common to level mid-battle actually
<Gumri> one hit with a sword gets xp, one fireball gets xp.
<Nyria> Oh yes and hey Dermathil ~
<Dermathil> Was steven_Magnet Banned?
<rainbowheaven> But i'm a freshman so i guess that explains things..
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 you get some nice kill animations on the power attacks sometimes too
<Gumri> Why do people now have a ~ at the end of sentences?
<Dken2021> I think steven is taking a "permenant rest"....
<Brawny> ~
<Dermathil> Gumri: that's Nyria's derpthingy
<StinkomanFan> Does he even have a limit on things he can carry?
<StickySyrup> I dont get it^
<Gumri> Not just Nyria though
<Dermathil> Nyria made it first
<Gumri> yes
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 like one of the 1-handed skills lets you decapitate npcs with a power blow if you're using a sword
<Gumri> It's fairly high though
<Gumri> but it has no meaning?
<Nyria> hey there there~ '~' is a free key~ I like it when other people use it~ But not to many people~
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 until you kill a few dragons, most of their drops are really heavy
<StickySyrup> loot ALL the food
<rainbowheaven> I thik I started that, Gumri. I typed Okay~!
<Nyria> Uh...
<Dken2021> just thought of something: Magypsie Ponies. Internet, make it happen
<Nyria> I've been doing it for a long time~
<StickySyrup> Nyria: Story time?
<Gumri> you have to store their stuff
<StinkomanFan> I can imagine, them being huge and all
<Nyria> About 1 2 3 4 5 6 7... 8... 9 weeks~
<Nyria> I think~
<rainbowheaven> Nyria: oh.... :$
<Gumri> Guys, does a 12 year old count as a brony?
<Nyria> Duh~
<Nyria> Yes~
<StickySyrup> of coourse
<Dken2021> bronies come in all ages
<rainbowheaven> Hey wut do u mean me?
<Gumri> not too young?
<ekips> some would say he is too old
<StickySyrup> no.. of course not
<Gumri> "Im 12 and what is this"
<Gumri> sorry ignore me
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 I'm not in a rush to restart my skyrim game until they drop the next patch, just lost a save file this weekend
<Gumri> im just being an idiot
<ekips> but yes, everybody should be allowed to be a brony
<Nyria> . . . You do know of my age right~
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 135 hours shot to a corrupt file
<StickySyrup> or a pegasister
<StickySyrup> if they is female
<rainbowheaven> ...
<rainbowheaven> Uh oh...
<Gumri> Erm
<Wrek> 05tohugh a 12 yo brony is still a 12 yo, henceforth likley to be annoying.
<Nyria> What is Uh oh~
<ekips> but be careful, the chat is pg-13
<rainbowheaven> I CAN"T SEE MY POSTS!
<Dken2021> I think the term "pegasister" is non valid
<StinkomanFan> So, workbenches fix armor and grindstones for weapons?
<StickySyrup> why?
<Dermathil> 12 year olds are borderline target demographic
<Gumri> some people prefer pegasister though
<LadyCanary> I dont really hear people say pegasister much.
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 upgrades them, no durability in the game
<StickySyrup> I am so slow with internet terminology
<Gumri> that is what i think Dermathil
<otakon> true
<StickySyrup> :[
<StinkomanFan> I suddenly want this game
<fluttercry> 05,15There was a kid in my highschool that was 12
<otakon> but Brony is gender neutral for the most part as how I see
<Dken2021> maybe this site should be called "PegasisterState"
<otakon> A Brony is just a older fan of the show
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 it is a good one, regardless of the bugs
<StickySyrup> still.. pegasister does sound kinda cool
<rainbowheaven> There Much better....:| i hates my computer
<NullRadix> Here, have some pony in training > http://fav.me/d4ni5v1 [deviantart]
<Gumri> the bro code says that women can be bros as well.
<Dken2021> nah, too wordy
<LadyCanary> For some reason, I just prefer brony.
<otakon> so, who's complaining about a 12 year old?
<StickySyrup> il brb
<StinkomanFan> Gonna have to remember this when dealing with buying a video game :s
<prince-dari> Brony is unisex IMO.
<Brawny> ^
<otakon> eeyup
<Brawny> also, hungry...must get food...
<otakon> gender neutral
<LunaTheBeloved> Brony...Pegasisiter...I personally don't mind either one
<LunaTheBeloved> *Sister
<Dken2021> ah, doing that Eqd trainning thing null?
<LadyCanary> Thank you, prince-dari~
<Gumri> no one is complaining otakon i was just wondering if they counted as bronies or if they are too young
<otakon> oh yeah
<otakon> at this point anyone outside the original demographic
<Phase4> ohai prince-dari
<otakon> i.e. 10 year old girls
<Phase4> and NullRadix
<prince-dari> Hey
<otakon> is a brony for the most part
<otakon> hello prince-dari how are you today?
<Gumri> Get it on the Xbox though I found the PC version to be irrortating
<prince-dari> Fine thanks, you?
<otakon> pretty good
<otakon> I see the bot is gone
*rainbowheaven reading some Bleach/MLP crossover comic
<otakon> I'm just glad to be back tbh
<Nyria> Sounds intresting rainbowheaven ~
<otakon> My net was out yesterday
<otakon> It sucked
<StinkomanFan> Killing animals and getting stuff from them to sell reminds me of Red Dead Redemption
<otakon> sell all the food Wrek!
<Ziltoid> Food can be good sometimes
<Nyria> Should I play video games or should I stay here~ Uh...
<otakon> yeah
<Ziltoid> early on
<otakon> Nyria: I don't know
<NullRadix> evening Phase4
<NullRadix> Nyria > both
<otakon> oh NullRadix the pic is looking good
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 PC will give you the mods and dev tools, console will probably give you better visuals
<otakon> okay, brb again
<NullRadix> the pic is... done...
<NullRadix> I dont have anymore time for it!
<Nyria> Well... I can't do both~
<NullRadix> or other things
<Ziltoid> Delphine is a wizard
<Gumri> Oh crap i just found a gitantic cut on my elbow... No idea how that happened
<NullRadix> Nyria: then your setup is lacking and you either need more monitor(s) or your TV closer to your computer
<NullRadix> but anyway
<Nyria> NullRadix: True...
<Gumri> True but it is a really, really bad port
<Nyria> Gumri: I hate when that happens~
<Phase4> Gumri: that happens to me to
<NullRadix> other places to go... before coming back and finding new ATG assignment
<Gumri> and it has 4 times as many bugs
<Phase4> tends to be my hands of feet though
*Cyanide is back
<StickySyrup> ok back
*NullRadix dives out the door
<Nyria> Hey Cyanide ~
<Gumri> hi Cyanide
<Phase4> Cyanide: hello
<LadyCanary> Hihi Cyanide
*StickySyrup is upset because someone crashed into his car today
<Cyanide> Hey everypony ~ ;3
<Nyria> What's this 'anide' at the end of your name Cy~
<LadyCanary> D: Oh that stinks, StickySyrup
*StickySyrup and drove away ='(
<StinkomanFan> What about Oblivion and it's differences?
<Nyria> Oh StickySyrup ...
*Nyria hugs StickySyrup ~
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 do you mean the console version or the pc version Gumri?
<LadyCanary> Was the damage bad?
<Cyanide> Nyria: Cyanide, it's a poison. It's what Cy is shortened from
<Gumri> the PC version
<MadxHatter123> Oh look. A game I never played.
<StickySyrup> thanks =) it was the left door and the wheel arch
<Nyria> There there StickySyrup ~ It will get better~
<StickySyrup> about £400
<Gumri> I have both, Xbox and PC versions before you start lectureing me :)
<Nyria> and Cyanide I didn't know about that~
<fluttercry> 05,15Cy does that include happiness?
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 the elder scrolls games used to be developed for the pc, then ported :(
<Cyanide> Lol.
<StickySyrup> Im so fustrated I could screem: ahhh (in fluttershy's voice)
<kirzstryfe> 11,14 that's the talent menu
<Cyanide> fluttercry: No, I home craft poisons in my free time
<Gumri> Oblivion was vastly superior on the PC
<StickySyrup> Wrek, will you download the ponies mod for skyrim?
<MadxHatter123> I got to ask, does a different thing play in each thearter, or is it playing in all of them?
<StickySyrup> it would make a good stream =P
<StinkomanFan> All the same
<MadxHatter123> ok
<Gumri> I put on one where dragons are fluttershy... Took it off when i realised i had to kill them.
<StinkomanFan> Interesting idea though
<Ziltoid> I wanna watch rainbow dash fight a dragon
<Nyria> No... Put dragons on where all of them are Randy savage~
<Ziltoid> or pinkie pie
<StickySyrup> Gumri: I would never be able to kill fluttershy
<MadxHatter123> Ziltoid: I would pay to see that
<Gumri> exactly
<StickySyrup> o btw I bought my first MLP today =)
<Ziltoid> you dont have to
<Ziltoid> go to youtube
<LadyCanary> StickySyrup: Awww! Which one?
<Nyria> Yeah~!
<Nyria> Which one?~
<Gumri> It is the funniest thing though when you are walking around and all you hear is "YAY"
<StickySyrup> LadyCanary: I got fluttershy
<StinkomanFan> But is Oblivion for the XBox 360 still good?
<Nyria> Nice~
<LadyCanary> Good choice~
<Gumri> yeah it's great
<MadxHatter123> So, is this skyrim or oblivion?
<Nyria> <3 Fluttershy~
<StickySyrup> they were running out though...
<StickySyrup> other bronies got there before me and took RD
<Ziltoid> skyrim
<StinkomanFan> Alright, that is all I needed to know
<StickySyrup> I asked shop assistant lol
<LadyCanary> I want one so bad...
<MadxHatter123> ah, ok.
<Nyria> StickySyrup: How did you ask him?~
<Ziltoid> fuck the thalmor
<Gumri> might seem a little outdated now though
<LadyCanary> Either Fluttershy or Rarity.
<Gumri> kill the thalmor
<Ziltoid> all elves must die
<MadxHatter123> I don't know when I'lll be able to start my pony collection. Maybe sometime after I finally get a job.
<Ziltoid> For the emporor
<Gumri> Oi im a Dark Elf
<rainbowheaven> Why can't i post a link? :'(
<StickySyrup> lol.. I went up and said: Do u have anymore of these? and pointed at the pic of RD
<Nyria> "Hey, your out of Rainbowdash ponies... I don't like stores where they don't have rainbow dash..." *puts on sunglasses*
<StickySyrup> she said: nope sold out yesturday
<LadyCanary> Holy crap...
<StinkomanFan> Meh, Outdated things can still be fun
<MadxHatter123> StickySyrup: Heh, I would totally do that, but with fluttershy.
<Gumri> very true.
<StickySyrup> seeing as we dont get MLP in UK (only very rarely) and they sold out of MLP....
<StickySyrup> My bronie sences are tingling
*Nyria has a pinkie brushie~
<MadxHatter123> Ah, that sucks.

<Yahooz> what is?
<otakon> because, poachers live there
<otakon> hi Yahooz
<RAWRity> remind me what's so gret about this game?
<LunaTheBeloved> Wrek sure did "pick" a good game to stream
<Yahooz> ohai oh taaaay kahn
<HeavyMetalDash> ikr I'm on the edge of my seat
<RAWRity> WOOO!
<StickySyrup> twi?
*Yahooz pronounces that name like that only when Wrek is here
<Gumri> CRASH!
<Yahooz> brb
<StickySyrup> uh oh
<MadxHatter123> Woah, it's twilight.
<otakon> ah
<RaveBrony> ^
<otakon> so that's wat happened
<RaveBrony> RAge quit??
<Gumri> And that is why you don't want Skyrim on the PC
<StickySyrup> twi is Dovahikin
<MadxHatter123> I think she closed the game
<RaveBrony> lol^
<emangamer> I continually feel the ugre to try /me in FB chat but then I realize it doesn't work
<StickySyrup> lolI did it on skype
<RaveBrony> lol
<LunaTheBeloved> I keep coming close to saying "everypny" in public
<LunaTheBeloved> *Everypony
<RaveBrony> Anyone hear about anonymous attacking FB soon? O_o
<LadyCanary> Eeeyup.
<MadxHatter123> StickySyrup: No silly, fluttershy is Dovahikin
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: You mean besides it being one of the better modern RPGs in existence? Not much really
<Dken2021> RaveBrony wha?
<StickySyrup> When I was asked to Identify the band AfroJack... I accerdently said Applejack! LoL
<Gumri> Anon are epic
<emangamer> RAWRity: did you join that NC brony group?
<RaveBrony> Anonymous plans to attack and shut down FB since its theyre enraged
<StickySyrup> "are they applejack?"... um no.. who is applejack
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: that 5 minutes of slowly...sloooooowwwwwlllllyyyyyyyyy mining sure seemed like the most fun I've had in years!
<MadxHatter123> Argh, wrong button
<CriticKitten> Heck, hadn't even touched the Elder Scrolls series until I first heard of Skyrim (and bought Oblivion) and even I can admit they're good games.
<StickySyrup> lol like a boss
<RaveBrony> LunaTheBeloved, I do the same!! Almost said it in class today xD
<Gumri> daedric armour looks so beast in Skyrim compared with Oblivion.
<StickySyrup> Fus Ro Dah ALL the children
<CriticKitten> What, you prefer your mining to be "click and done", thus defeating the whole "realism" aim they're going for?
<RaveBrony> lol
<Ziltoid> SKyrim realistic?
<MadxHatter123> ok, as I was saying, Oh wait, she's the DovahNeiGH http://dreatos.deviantart.com/art/Dragonshy-Enter-the-DOVahNeiGH-271635814
<Ziltoid> lolwut
<Wrek> 05ORITE WAS CRAFTIGN MY ARSE OFF
<Gumri> Skyrim isnt remotely realistic
<Wrek> 05tiem to sell shit
<CriticKitten> If it takes a little longer, who cares? Are you that concerned about rushing around to kill dudes? :p
<RaveBrony> lol! Over encumbered
*HeavyMetalDash is preparing for work now
<StickySyrup> Get the steed stone!!!
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: if realism comes coupled with unending boredom, I'll take the hit.
*emangamer ded
<StickySyrup> best stone
<MadxHatter123> Wooo! go sell that stuff!
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02WREK
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02What are you playing? :>
<Gumri> I have watched that bloody Italian intro about 15 times now...
<RaveBrony> :o
<CriticKitten> I love how people jump on my comment without thinking. Now let's try again. Yes, compared to some RPGs out there, it most certainly is closer to realism. >_>
<StickySyrup> ...
<CriticKitten> Is it 100% realistic? Well no, but no game is. That's the point.
*RaveBrony looks at SB and facehoofs
<CriticKitten> It being a game and all.
<StickySyrup> omg lol guna take a while
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Why the facehoof? D:
<CriticKitten> But it's pretty obvious Skyrim aims for a "realistic" bent, and it doesn't do a bad job of that.
<otakon> guys I think Wrek got dc'd
<StickySyrup> just tele to the front doors of whiterun!
<RAWRity> it's not about killing dudes, it's about a game being fun to play, and this...doesnt' look fun. this looks ungodly dull.
<Gumri> it's Skyrim SB
<RaveBrony> Well, its only if you really dont know what hes playing :o
<LunaTheBeloved> I don't know what he's playing......
<LunaTheBeloved> :P
<RaveBrony> :o :o
<Dken2021> Me either :P
<RAWRity> he's playing Pokemon of course.
<StickySyrup> ...
<Gumri> I can sing the Italian intro i have watched it that many times...
<RaveBrony> SKyrim!
<StickySyrup> is this GTA?
<LunaTheBeloved> I thought it was Mario.....
<meh> oh i love pokemon
<RaveBrony> Lol....you trolls xD
<LunaTheBeloved> Skyrim? Never heard of that
<CriticKitten> So the massacre of people just a few minutes ago is overruled by the ten second mining sequence, RAWRity? Whatever ya say bro, to each their own I guess.
<CriticKitten> xD
<RAWRity> "Go kill 10 Giant Rats and I'll buy your armor."
<Dken2021> this is clearly dragon quest
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02I didnt know cause im not watching the stream ;___;
<StickySyrup> Is this medal of honor, modern black ops 3?
<otakon> well SuperBrony64|AFK it's dead
<Gumri> He might not have been wat.... ninja'd
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I've only been here for the Mining and the walking.

<otakon> saying goodnight to people is SO hard sometimes!
*LordCelestia picks up Luna the beloved and beloves her
<Dken2021> ello Flutterguy
<LunaTheBeloved> <3
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Some RPGs don't boil down to "kill dudes, kill more dudes" ad infinitum. Some incorporate a lot of tasks that feel "normal" as part of the goal to get you integrated and invested in the world and your character. If you don't like those sorts of games that's cool, but don't be ridiculous and say that they can't be enjoyable.
<Phase4> ohai FlutterBro13|Shower
*IshBestKitty|Meow purrs and rubs against LadyCanary meow
<MadxHatter123> I love cats
<Phase4> i meen Flutterguy
<Phase4> damned tab fails
<Gumri> I can sing the Italian intro but i have absolutely no idea what im saying :D
<Flutterguy> Phase4, I get that alot.. :l
<otakon> agreed CriticKitten and nice textwall
<MadxHatter123> I wish my apartment allowed them. I would have a cat sooooo quickly.
*SuperBrony64|AFK wants to take a nap but can't ;___;
*LadyCanary pets IshBestKitty|Meow and hugs him tight
<IshBestKitty|Meow> mew
<CriticKitten> I has kitty. He's currently.....*looks
<fluttercry> 05,15You have to be careful with cats, some are loveable and awesome. Others are little monsters
*Flutterguy hugs SuperBrony64|AFK
<Gumri> sometimes i swear to god you are high SB :D
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I'm not saying it has to be about killing dudes. It could be about anything if it was enjoyable. Skyrim, to me, just doesn't seem like much fun for all the hype it's been given.
<Flutterguy> I can't take naps either ;_;
<LadyCanary> My friend's cat loves to sleep on her Xbox controller xD
<MadxHatter123> SuperBrony64: I'll sing you a lullaby if you want?
<otakon> fluttercry: agreed
<MidnightBolt> Awww look at the frost troll
<Phase4> http://xkcd.com/231/
<otakon> man that daedric glove is AWESOME
<MadxHatter123> better yet, we'll al get Fluttershy to sing you one.
<Phase4> love that xkcd
<CriticKitten> Ah, there he is
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Okay :3
<MadxHatter123> all*
<CriticKitten> He's chillin' like a villain under my bed
<fluttercry> 05,15My cat is neither. She just sleeps and sometimes let's you near her.
<otakon> lol Phase4
<IshBestKitty|Meow> mew
<otakon> damn he's lucky
*IshBestKitty|Meow purrs
<Gumri> I used to have 2 cats... One was called Hitler.
<MadxHatter123> *sighs* My kitty passed away a while ago, I miss my three legged kitty...
<emangamer> Phase4: how can you not love ANY XKCD
<IshBestKitty|Meow> mew
<Phase4> emangamer: i dont, i love all of them
<Phase4> and the more i learn the more love there is
<Gumri> so much EQD
<Phase4> meh, never been much for that sort of thing
<Phase4> meh: ohai there
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: As I said, if you don't like that sort of game, 'scool. Just don't be a doofus about it and make it sound like it can't possibly be enjoyable. Some people really get into this sort of thing, to the point where they're having fun decorating their house. I'm not very into decoration and prefer function to pretty, but it's what makes these games enjoyable for some.
<meh> ohai
<LadyCanary> ....Oh...my...GOSH.
<LadyCanary> Those items look AWESOME
<meh> indeed
<LunaTheBeloved> I want this!!!!
<LunaTheBeloved> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LMnKSYycaIA/Tx9KcSS3PhI/AAAAAAAAcYk/lwBxBQbqVVc/s1600/0.jpg

<LadyCanary> I really want the tin thingy xD and I'll get the crayons for my cousin
<Gumri> i want the ruler

<MadxHatter123> Holy pony, so much stuff. I am so getting the cards.
<Gumri> mostly to troll my non brony friends
<emangamer> LunaTheBeloved: that looks computer made
<meh> so many awesome things but id never get a chance to use them
<LunaTheBeloved> But.....but.......its real......
<LunaTheBeloved> Isn't it?
<LadyCanary> I'd use the ones I like thoroughly
<Gumri> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qv-_aUZUOhk/Tx9KpKfcTkI/AAAAAAAAcb8/wT9915oEkPE/s1600/9999.jpg DO WANT
<Ziltoid> WHat lvl is this character?
<emangamer> LunaTheBeloved: I never said it wasnt but the way the latch looked it looked computer generated
<meh> over 9000
<Phase4> LunaTheBeloved: yeah, thats rendered. might be a real thing but that image isnt
<Gumri> 81 i would take a guess
<Gumri> nope
<RAWRity> they don't have a rarity pencil. FAILURES
<Gumri> ignore that
<pinkydash> ^wrong chat xD
<LunaTheBeloved> I would go back to school just to have that.
<IshBestKitty|Meow> meow
<CDN> Ah Skyrim.
<Gumri> Get a twilight one to be ironic
<Dken2021> I bet someone will buy those canvases and make beautiful art with it
<icelordcryo> multitasking
<LadyCanary> I'm sure Dken2021 :D
<Gumri> ... would that be ironic or the opposite to ironic
*IshBestKitty|Meow purrs and rubs against DerpyHooves`
*CriticKitten prods silly filly computer. :|
<MadxHatter123> I want those pencils. Wait, I wonder if they'll have pens, I prefer to use those.
<pinkydash> DUN DUN DUN
<pinkydash> yahooz
<Gumri> they dont have pens for some silly reaosn
<meh> me too
*MadxHatter123 pets kitty while still under Derpy.
<Yahooz> always quick on my entrances...
<Yahooz> somehow...
<RaveBrony> mlp pens would be awesome
<Yahooz> i dun get it
<pinkydash> eeeyup
<Yahooz> whatever
<Gumri> how did a kitty get into bronystate anyway?
*IshBestKitty|Meow purrs
<RaveBrony> I need to learn how to sew together those plushies people make...
*Flutterguy strokes CriticKitten's back
<pinkydash> I enlisted Kodiak's help in stalking you
<pinkydash> DUN DUN DUN
<Phase4> that sort of merch i've never liked. visualy theres to much going on and the faces are all blank
*CriticKitten purrs softly

<MadxHatter123> Gumri: Who cares. Kitties are awesome.
<Yahooz> where has he been for the past three weeks?
<Yahooz> like seriously?
<meh> lmao RAWRity
<Phase4> RAWRity: that makes the entire series better
<pinkydash> Kodiak, he's building giant killer robots
<pinkydash> apparently o-o
<Dken2021> RAWRity that would've been my first guess
<Gumri> disenchant so you can enchant something else Phase4
<Yahooz> maybe he is waiting in Africa...
<Yahooz> XD
<IshBestKitty|Meow> mew
<pinkydash> LOL eeeyup
<LunaTheBeloved> RAWRity, No way Twilight Saga could have a character that cool
<Dken2021> nyan?
<Phase4> Gumri: i figured as much, but selling them and buying blank boots seems like a better way to go
*IshBestKitty|Meow purrs and rubs against RAWRity
<Dken2021> Frosty would give everyone the cold shoulder
*RAWRity pulls out a bag of catnip.
<IshBestKitty|Meow> Meow
<Yahooz> goddamitSATbot, why you so soon? XP
<MadxHatter123> RaveBrony: Hasbro needs to make plushes to sell to us, well, those of us who can't sew.
<LunaTheBeloved> I want to see The Twilight Saga now with Frosty edited in
<pinkydash> I miss @pony
<Gumri> I don't know why im all hostile to Kitty.... I suppose it amuses me
<Yahooz> pinkydash, until Steven_Magnets comes back
<Flutterguy> LunaTheBeloved, I don't think I'd watch it even with Frosty edited in.. :l
*IshBestKitty|Meow scratches Gumri's face "hiss"
<Gumri> OW!
<RaveBrony> Yeah....the plushies ive seen on ebay go for about $300, and thats just starting price! And people actually bid on them!!
<LunaTheBeloved> I would.
<pinkydash> lol maybe there's Steven_Magnet version 2
<otakon> IshBestKitty|Meow: bad kitty!
<RAWRity> it's because Gumri secretly thinks CriticKitten is Opal

<Shizuka> 13why kick when you can precision strike with an orbital high energy particle cannon
<Dken2021> rainbowheaven I take it you're an anime fan?
<rainbowheaven> OKay..i know..
<rainbowheaven> Yes
<RAWRity> though Valthejean chooses to use a Trident that makes people explode.
<FluttershyOHYEAH11> Why do ppl like anime? I never watched an episode
<Dashie_Dashie> Shizuka doesn't miss.
<Yahooz> We also kick with wub from time to time...

<FluttershyOHYEAH11> What Anime SHould I start watching?
*Yahooz peirces the heavens
<Cy> Shizuka wouldn't take wrath out on me though :3
<LunaTheBeloved> Come to the Moon, it gets lonely up here some times
<emangamer> FluttershyOHYEAH11: it depends on the anime. I like DBZ kinda and YYH somewhat but past that
<Dken2021> no place? not even under the desk at my school?
<NxPaqu> mmmmmbananas
*Cy heads toward the moon
<otakon> FluttershyOHYEAH11: I suggest FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood, good anime.
<emangamer> FluttershyOHYEAH11: I would suggest Yu Yu Hakusho
<Shizuka> 13if you did something bad i would
<rainbowheaven> otakon: I'm more of a follower of the popular animes.
<Yahooz> Start by watching GURREN LAGGAN
<Cy> D:
<Shizuka> 13it is not fun to have to dispense wrath
*LunaTheBeloved puts out a giant mattres out for Cy
<emangamer> Shizuka: unless you are power hungry
*Cy starts sobbing on the way to the moon
<NxPaqu> Gurren Laggan is awesome, so is Angel Beats
<Yahooz> ^
<otakon> rainbowheaven: it's GAINAX! it is definitely one of the most, well amazing shows you'll ever see
<RAWRity> FluttershyOHYEAH11: depends on what you like. Are you more in to heavy action, or character studies, comedy? drama?
*Cy misses the mattress and hits into the surface
<kirzstryfe> 11,14I get to nom on ponies hit by Shizuka's wrath
<Dken2021> rainbowheaven ever watched Cowboy Bebop?
<LunaTheBeloved> Ouch.....my bad
<RAWRity> otakon: Gainax isn't exactly a seal of approval.
<FluttershyOHYEAH11> AnSooo Whats the BEST Anime?
<RAWRity> Gainax has a tendency to half-bake their shows.
<CriticKitten> GASP
<otakon> true
<rainbowheaven> Dken2021: Yeah. My big brother actually like that naime
<otakon> but GL is NOT half baked
<rainbowheaven> *anime
<Cy> LunaTheBeloved: Tis all good
<Yahooz> More rules: dont upset the dari-bot. PM uncle otakon for more information on that
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't worry if you get put on the moon. You have SO MANY FRIENDS there.
*LunaTheBeloved hugs Cy
<otakon> yeah
<CriticKitten> No insider trading for Congress? What a concept! That's why most Americans thought of it ten years ago
*Cy hugs LunaTheBeloved
<CriticKitten> >_<
<otakon> I don't mind questions and I'll do my best to help you out.
<FluttershyOHYEAH11> Theres a Dolphin ride on the moon!
<LunaTheBeloved> I'm here on the Moon, by choice though
<otakon> and BENDER!

*rainbowheaven rides moon dolphin
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And awesome songs by Tiny Tim.
<LawnchairRawket> I like the moon.
<LawnchairRawket> But I like the sun more.
<Cy> I like it here better, it quieter. :3
<LawnchairRawket> If only I could be so grossly incandesant. . .
<Yahooz> brb
<emangamer> GUYS I have a theory, I dont think that Luna was actually on the SURFACE of the moon. If you watch episode one when the stars combine the mare in the moon symbol on the moon dissappears. Maybe she was trapped "inside" it like the Man in the moon. (hence mare in the moon)
<LunaTheBeloved> I plan to start working on Luna Land pretty soon up here.
<FluttershyOHYEAH11> Can any Alicorn send me to the moon please?
<Dken2021> you and your crazy theroies
<rainbowheaven> who wants a free burger?

<LunaTheBeloved> You got any ideas Cy?
*rainbowheaven looks over LunaTheBeloved's shoulder
<Cy> Hmm, I suppose a whole section of Dolphin coin machines must go in somewhere
<rainbowheaven> Wow...nice plans
<emangamer> Cy: makes sense
<otakon> OKAY!
*LunaTheBeloved points to the corner "here looks good"
<emangamer> yes... otakon *bats his eyelashes like pinkie pie*
<rainbowheaven> FOR WUT?
*Cy will be right back
<rainbowheaven> Luna...tell...
