<Lordlyhour> Massive freedom
<Krakissi> That's why they needed a new stif.

<KShrike> Sketchy_Sounds: Everyone knows I'm better, and they hate me for it. And now that I love ponies, they hate me even more. Even worse is that they can't prove that I'm gay.

<Silvermane> 15As am I. it is nice to be able to read what is being said
<Sumica> what's all this about desync?
<Spose> Hiya Spin :)
<KShrike> All they throw is overgeneralization

<Sketchy_Sounds> KShrike, how old are you?
<Lordlyhour> Spose is spose
<RainbowSmash> Dat deux ex machina
<Krakissi> She breathed blood into him.
*Silvermane prepares the anti-glomp bat
<KShrike> Pray that one gets aired in season 2
<LoLZorZs> What do you think the main antagonist will be in season 2?
<Krakissi> Makes sense.
<Lordlyhour> Plain and simple
<KShrike> Sketchy_Sounds: 19, almost 20
<MetalRainbowDash> Explosion
<MetalRainbowDash> Incoming
<HotCocoa> KShrike: that's what I just said :P
<KShrike> Sophomore at Liberty
<Corwyn> How does cpr work with no blood?
<graypaw> its doctor who everything makes sense.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I thought so.
<DecapKing> 4i feel somewhat ignored
<T3hG33kz> SPAAAAAAACE....
<Spose> I bet the first episode of season 2 will be about patience.
<Lordlyhour> Dischord
<Luna> 07That's odd. It's showing up as green on mywot.com. Out of 100, it ranks 91 on trustworthiness, 89 on vendor reliability, 88 on privacy, and 89 on child safety. Overall, mywot.com considers dinkypage.com to be an excellent site in terms of safety.
<Luna> 07Bear in mind that some pages WILL set off false alarms.

*Nightshade destroy anti-glomp bat then proceeds to bear hug
<Lordlyhour> ad then 20 episodes of slice of life
<HotCocoa> Hey roushguy
<MrChang> this is why this doctor sucks
<madponyking> why dose he not need oxygen?
<Combustiblelemons> FIX IT
<DrWhooves> he didnt lose all his blood
<ShadTheCrazed> Yeah, I can't wait for them to "find out" that I am a Brony, and they'll try to prove I am a bunch of thing I am not.
<DrWhooves> just a lot
<MetalRainbowDash> FIX IT
<scatr> having two hearts you'd think the doctor would actually need *more* ocygen
<KShrike> Sketchy_Sounds: what do you mean by that?
<scatr> thn a human
<Nashy> There needs to be an episode/fanfic about a new craze, this series of books about adorable crows
<mib_9upb3t> because she stopped before she sucked him dry
<Spin> 1st ep is a 2 part about Discord is it not
<scatr> typos everywhere
<MetalRainbowDash> *lol*
<Silvermane> 15hmm? who said that
<Combustiblelemons> *facepalm*
<LoLZorZs> Spose: you mean episode 3
<Fluttershy> I'm sorry... ): -hugs DecapKing-
<Nashy> and the "cronies" who like them
<ShadTheCrazed> Meanwhile, I'm lying hints EVERYWHERE I am a Brony.
<herospirit> Thunder, when chat is less populated some time, we will share the glory of Best Blue Guy
<HotCocoa> Spin: yes.
<herospirit> :0
*Wrek is nomming cheese doodles and is loving it!
<MetalRainbowDash> YES!
<ValtheJean> technically it's 9am on saturday
<Bufurd> *explotions*
<MetalRainbowDash> HE DID IT
<Thunder_Dash> Indeed
<Spose> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6dq_tbapBY Rainbow Dash is awesome.
*DecapKing 4gets hugged
<MetalRainbowDash> But he's dying too.
<Combustiblelemons> well that was easy.
<Silvermane> 15oh hey DecapKing
<HotCocoa> Hey Plorf
<Fluttershy> Elky: Yes?
<LunaTheForgotten> *oxygen*
<roushguy> I want to find out more about that palette swapped Rainbow Dash
<Plorf> Hi there
<Luna> 07it's a copy paste :P
<Spose> And I mean Discord relating to patience.
<Luna> 07not me :P
<HotCocoa> roushguy: good luck :)
<MetalRainbowDash> *He needs oxygen*
<Spin> Spose: Agreed
<ValtheJean> yeah I know
*Silvermane 15puts on his Pizza Pony uniform
<Spose> Cause we don't really know whats bad about Discord yet.
<MetalRainbowDash> Wait wut
<Elky> sorry, I was talking about the show fluttershy
<MetalRainbowDash> What are we talking about
*Silvermane 15hands DecapKing a pizza-cake
<MetalRainbowDash> OH
<Combustiblelemons> negative oxygen
<Lordlyhour> NASHY
<Elky> it gets confusing
<prince-dari> Red or blue?
<Krakissi> OMINOUS OXYGEN METER
<Mosly> why is doctor who playing?
<LvS> his name
<Lordlyhour> HELL yes
<prince-dari> Red.
<Scarlet_Pimponyl> man, from the side, his hair looks like Dr. Whooves's
<ShadTheCrazed> In fact, I bet my severe popularity in the 8th grade can encourage them.
<madponyking> why dose he not need it?
<Fluttershy> Ah, okay. ^^
<DecapKing> 4thanks Fluttershy and Silvermane
<HotCocoa> "dischord" = opposite of "harmony"
<Hat> what's an oxygen metre doing in there
<KShrike> I just realized, a majority of the people that are hating are homophobes. So unjustly homophobic, considering that the majority of bronies are straight.
<Lordlyhour> Massive Hatedome against the Cronies
<Combustiblelemons> BITCH YOU OWE US OXYGEN
<Lordlyhour> and then EVERYONE becomes a cronie
<Fluttershy> pizza-cake? o-o
<Nashy> Yes, some people hate it and get angry
<HotCocoa> So, I can infer that Discord will be disrupting the elements of harmony in some way.
<MetalRainbowDash> *oxygen*
<Hat> ads in the show too lol
<DecapKing> 4although, i dont remember ordering a pizza-cake......
<Combustiblelemons> .... what how.
<HotCocoa> But that's as far as I'm speculating.
<Vissia> its raining on the moon
<madponyking> LOL WUT?
<Nightshade> did I just see luna!?
<roushguy> Oh good
<Ghosties> 4Did Chaos say that in the chat?
<SlurryMoon> It's raining ON THE MOOOOOOOOON
<roushguy> Pinkamena's gone.
<Nashy> and also there are some cronies who can't accept that others don't want to read the books
<madponyking> MOON RAIN FTW...
*Silvermane 15removes Pizza Pony uniform. 'i'm all naked!'
<Luna> 07I'm here
<roushguy> She really creeps me out.
<MetalRainbowDash> 10 Mins left of this
<Combustiblelemons> Celestia banished rain
<ShadTheCrazed> HotCocoa: Anti-elements of harmony?
<KShrike> I guess you guys are tired of hearing me rage.
<Luna_In_Socks> There's no "h" in "Discord." He gets annoyed when people don't spell it right.
<KShrike> Sorry guys.
<Luna> 07EQD
*Luna_In_Socks frowns.
<Nightshade> I just saw you on the moon :D

<Caramel> like, you're logged in as an alias
<herospirit> NO.
<holem> 0hello Vanilla
<herospirit> NOT :P
<Thunder_Dash> hi Vanilla
<herospirit> :[
<Caramel> and want to say like: "Yo, I'm actually someone else"
<Octavia> 13Or you mean to sign in as a different name than your registered one?
<VanillaKites> =)
<Fernando> Dh
<Hat> hi vanilla!
<herospirit> there we go
<Octavia> honestly, if my son asked me i would give him a brohoof
<DecapKing> 4yeah, im too lazy to figure out how to get it from my PC to Xbox
<^Stargazer> if she was a good mother she'd understand and still respect you for who you are
<Caramel> yeah
<Octavia> maybe i would be a cool mom though
<Rainbow_Dash> Hmm
<Rainbow_Dash> I see Herospirit
<Keyframe> So I'm thinking http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/PopCulture/EverythingElse/ComicsAnimeCartoons/My-Little-Pony-Brony-TShirt-138545.jsp or http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/PopCulture/EverythingElse/ComicsAnimeCartoons/My-Little-Pony-20-Percent-TShirt-120711.jsp
<Octavia> 13What Dari said, yeah.
<^Stargazer> ponies should be the least of her worries
<prince-dari> >DL'd 20GB PS3 game
<prince-dari> >server speed was capped at 50kbps
<prince-dari> >took 5 days
<Caramel> um, that doesn't seem to work
<herospirit> I wish I could play with you guys. : /
<Xiagu> Keyframe, why are you buying from hot topic
<prince-dari> >went to play it
<prince-dari> >was corrupt
<prince-dari> MFW
<roushguy> Well
<prince-dari> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
<madponyking> wait. a razor blade?
<roushguy> My mom is probably a bit strange sometimes.
<madponyking> for what?
<prince-dari> Doesn't work with Anope services then.
<Sumica> Cuting and splicing tape
<Bufurd> you have to cut out segments of tape
<Geradex> you know the second shirt was stolen art last time I checked
<Bufurd> yes
<Tasorow_> cutting the film
<Geradex> unless that got resolved
<Scarlet_Pimponyl> Sweet. There's a new Ask Pinkamina
<Caramel> blarg
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> what are we watching?
<Octavia> it was resolved
<Keyframe> It got resolved
<madponyking> aaaaaah... thanks
<JackiePie> I couldn't agree with you more Stargazer, but unfortunately we still live in a society where if a male has any interest in anything deemed female, that people will freak out like idiots.
<DecapKing> 4where did you dl it from?
<madponyking> burn notice
<Sumica> Burn notice
<Bufurd> burn notice
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> A PRESENT!
<Geradex> ok, then as long as it got resolved the second one
<Rainbow_Dash> I do to Herospirit
<Bufurd> hopefully pony after
<Rainbow_Dash> >.<
<Keyframe> I'm actually trying to find that persons other works
<FreezeFrame> But if a female has interest in things that are "masculine", it's generally acceptable.
<Neo> Ello?
<Rainbow_Dash> If I do Co-OP with Decapking, he will get me killed
<Rainbow_Dash> XD
<Xiagu> Keyframe, megasweet
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> hopefully pony after too
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Sumica> Pony is normaly on friday nights
<JackiePie> Welcome to hypocrisy, population over a billion
<Neo> Yay
<Scarlet_Pimponyl> Hopefully Saints vs GB after.
<Dashite> No pony except on Fridays.
<Neo> Someone is online
<madponyking> awww...
<Bufurd> what
<Combustiblelemons> >mfw my roommate is away for the weekend
<madponyking> pony
<roushguy> yeah
<roushguy> Ah well
<DecapKing> 4im actually getting mine through a more.... illicit mean
<mook> ignorance is bliss
<Keyframe> And the shirts Xiagu?
<Dashite> At least no pony episodes.
<FreezeFrame> But I'm gonna watch my FOOTBALL, because it's fun.
<RainbowDashCancel> Not even over 9000 would account to the population of hypocrisy
<^Stargazer> that's societies problem, not mine
<roushguy> So
<RainbowDashCancel> not even come close
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> MAI TIRES
<holem> 0Like a Bawwwsss
<roushguy> Is there an adorable Fluttershy shirt?
<prince-dari> ps3iso probably.
<Combustiblelemons> http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110807040942/callofduty/images/d/d2/Rainbow_dash_awesome_face_by_wakabalasha-d3axhz1.png
<prince-dari> >called ps3iso
<prince-dari> >files arnen't isos
<prince-dari> XD
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> POPS TIRES LIEK A BAWS
<Xiagu> Keyframe, why Hot Topic?
<GGgala> Polarfire!
<Rainbow_Dash> Maybe Co Op will still work Decap
<Octavia> 13http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=PA64zTvw1_o :D
<Rainbow_Dash> *cough cough*
<DecapKing> 4it might
<Sumica> The radient heat comes from all the glass buildings and concreet with little to no grass or trees.
<Octavia> 13:D
<Combustiblelemons> I can watch pony as loud as I want to on friday, saturday and sunday now ^_^
<prince-dari> MFW you get on always as I'm leaving now.
<JackiePie> Well stargazer, you're lucky to be able to have that opinon. For younger bronies, they have to listen to their parents, even if that means obeying childish nonsense like men shouldn't watch girl shows.
<prince-dari> :'(
<prince-dari> Hey <3
<Keyframe> Because, for now, I can't find a duplicate of that shirt
<JackiePie> Many people are pathetically immature.
<prince-dari> And night.
<^Stargazer> http://i.neoseeker.com/mgv/60953-Shadow%20of%20Death/953/8/1hinegy65qxef_y88enxjypixzqeceu_display.png
<FreezeFrame> My folks never gave me guff about it
<^Stargazer> lol, I like his expression lmao
<Xiagu> Keyframe, but there are so many other nifty shirts
<herospirit> I have a tendency to get myself killed trying to save my allies. No man left behind, y'know?
<Bufurd> Party Loud
<GGgala> yeah, i was about to give him the bad news, dari :(
<Xiagu> ^^^
<DecapKing> 4brb, im gonig to restart my PC quick
<madponyking> I can watch pony as loud as I want to everyday because I hsa
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<JackiePie> As for why Hot Topic, a better question would be why We Love Fine.
<Lapsus> oh my god ^Stargazer
<Nashy> Because females are seen as less worth than males, so males acting more "female" is seen as a downgrade.
<Keyframe> I know, I'm looking. I just like that design
<Lapsus> that is AMAZING
<prince-dari> Night GGgala, Polarfire.
<Nashy> Sadly.
<FreezeFrame> Of course, I wouldn't be caught dead watching the MLP that was around when I had to listen to them.
<GGgala> buuut it seems he's afk-ish
<madponyking> *have brony pride
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> PONI
<FreezeFrame> That was.... G3
<JackiePie> Nashy yup I was reading something about that, eh somewhere
<Rainbow_Dash> Yeah
<Keyframe> Because at We Love Fine had a Pony contest. Why you judging me?
<GGgala> night dari
<FreezeFrame> and 3.5
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> also i think i may have a friend who is a brony
<Combustiblelemons> >forever a closet brony
<Xiagu> Keyframe, http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/custom-merch-mega-mall.html and also the spreadshirt shirts (ShirtBrony, etc)
<JackiePie> I'm not I'm judging them.
<johnsey> the best option if you want to buy brony shirts is still http://subtlebronytees.spreadshirt.com/nightmare-moon-sw-A7846229#
<FreezeFrame> Anyway, I watched David the Gnome all the freaking time.
<Thunder_Dash> I easily could but I prefer to use my headphones when I'm watching alone
<FreezeFrame> Football Season kickoff in 17 minutes
<Combustiblelemons> better safe than sorry huh Thunder_Dash
<Ziltoid> dat kiss
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> if he is one he's not a closet brony, it's hard to explain
<Ghosties> 4AWWWW YEAH
<Bufurd> Jailbait!
<FreezeFrame> And Sailor Moon
<madponyking> yeah. the sound gets distorted without the phones...
<Ghosties> 4GET SOME OF THAT SWEET STUFF
<Xiagu> johnsey, damn you now I have another shirt I want
<Hat> do the people who stream happen to have rooms full of box sets of house, burn notice and doctor who ready to be played on a moments notice?
*Hat hugs streamers
<johnsey> Xiagu: welcome to her herd.
<Thunder_Dash> Not particularly, my parents both know full well (hell, my mom's seen some of it too) and one of my friends is a brony
<Dashite> Hat, of course.
<CarrotTop> I really don't understand you, EqD, sometimes.
<Razyn> 11ohai Polarfire
<Keyframe> Johnsey there's only... 9 items on here
<CarrotTop> Fanfiction rules:
<Luna> 07<< owns House MD
*Bufurd hugs Hat
<CarrotTop> >no gore
<Combustiblelemons> MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony: subtle references work
<CarrotTop> >cupcakes post on the very next line
<Dashite> How else could they play the videos?!
<Octavia> theres 4 pages
<Sumica> nah hat I have afew TB external drives.
<Ziltoid> FRiENDSHIP
<Keyframe> Lies it says "1 of 1"
<Combustiblelemons> I know from experience after uncovering my friend was a brony by saying 20% cooler in a sentence
<Sumica> HDD streaming is faster then from disk
<FreezeFrame> CarrotTop: There's a single Cupcakes post
<Luna> 07I bronified my boyfriend :)
<^Stargazer> I think I found a good fluttershy shirt... looks like girl only though =/
<johnsey> cupcakes i long beyond simply being a gorefic.
<CarrotTop> it makes no sense
<Ghosties> 4Octi
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I love that Scott Ramsoomair keeps putting ponies into his comics
<CarrotTop> cupcakes is definitely gore
<Luna> 07he's using the pony starwars wallpaper
<^Stargazer> http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=489
<ValtheJean> 2,14 like the most recent one says 20% cooler
<Combustiblelemons> Luna, you are awesome.
<FreezeFrame> Put up for the sole reason of stopping peoples' complaints
<Sumica> Star Driver before any one ask
*GGgala pokes Polarfire
<johnsey> it's a meme, whether you like it or not
<CarrotTop> why is it there when there's a rule against it
<GGgala> think he's afk.
<Silverscreen> 11Hey Dari, you should put something like RETIRED underneath anyone who's resigned in the About Us page.
<Xiagu> when I type "equestria daily" into google, cupcakes is the first suggestion :(
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> well today he asked if i like bronies and my brother (who is violently antibrony) got into an argument i couldn't really understand what anyone said because everything was so loud
<mib_1d9wxw> whats next
<CarrotTop> my opinion of it is 100% irrelevant
<VanillaKites> I'm trying to ponify my sis
<Ziltoid> no star driver
<Ziltoid> nope
<VanillaKites> it's hard
<Luna> 07You mean Hip Silver?
<madponyking> Luna, inspires to become a great pony converter...
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> it's wierd
<ValtheJean> :(
<prince-dari> >_> not all of us are mods in this room
<Combustiblelemons> violently antibrony?
<CarrotTop> a site that doesn't follow its own rules has no integrity
<prince-dari> <_<
<Thunder_Dash> and then Star Driver
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> yes
<FreezeFrame> CarrotTop: Because as the owner of EqD, Sethisto can make exceptions
<ValtheJean> I promised...I wouldn't...cry...
<Ghosties> 4WHOOPS
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> violently anti brony
<Luna> 07WHOOPS
<FreezeFrame> And a rule that doesn't allow exceptions is draconian
<Ghosties> 4XD
<madponyking> what are we watching?
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Combustiblelemons> what does he want to kill us all?
*Luna *runs into her safety corner*
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> anime
<Ghosties> 4DON'T TELL ANYONE *angry face*
<johnsey> There are always exceptions to the rule.
*johnsey puts on sunglasses
<Silverscreen> 11Luna said it, not me.
<GGgala> there's gotta be pirate servers for co-op, right?
<johnsey> dealwithit.xcf
<madponyking> I mean What anime...
<Xiagu> xcf?
<Nashy> Rules are for people who lack sense and morals.
<Combustiblelemons> not fond on anime btw.
<Luna> 07Guilty...!
<Ziltoid> Star driver
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> well every chance he gets he spews forth hate
*Luna was thinking this was the modchat...
<Ziltoid> kiss kiss
<johnsey> Xiagu: gimp
<prince-dari> Anyway yeah, we haven't told people yet Silver, we're gunna do it a while into S2.
<Sumica> That part where i said Star driver before any one ask.

<Sumica> Going to do a few animes before going back to live again.
<Octavia> 13Aww, it'll be alright Val.
<Nashy> Eh, I don't agree. Sense and morals are nice.
*Octavia 13hugs Val
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> watanabe... man...i hate that name due to a book
<Nashy> Rules can be bad, or stupid.
*ValtheJean cries on Octavia's shoulders
*^Stargazer looks at his nightmare moon figurine next to his laptop

<Luna> 07Why sad?
<GGgala> oh, this is that show with the depressed teacher... right?

<Sumica> Some day i hope to get color so people stop disreguarding what I say =p

<^Stargazer> interesting, I just noticed NMM only has her cuttie mark on one side... oh well I still like it ( or is that how it is in the show? )
<ValtheJean> lol
<ValtheJean> >mods leaving
<Thunder_Dash> tbh I don't really care what format/media/whatever is in, so long as I find the show itself good
<MrDrProfDrSgtLtBrony> yeah the intro is pretty decent
<mib_1d9wxw> that is one skinny gundam
<Octavia> 13Hipster.

<MetalRainbowDash> What is it like being an OP?
<Fluttershy> Do you think it would be weird if I alternated between three main nicknames from the mane 6? o-o
<FreezeFrame> Apple Bloom/Snips
<Octavia> 13Its crazy!
<DecapKing> hey Octavia
<MetalRainbowDash> And is there like any requirements to get it?

<ValtheJean> on the forum? yeah
<VanillaKites> O.O
<MetalRainbowDash> So like what do I say Octavia
<Xiagu> >Football is mentioned
<HaysforPonies> MLP ships are like R34 and Lets Plays. If it hasn't happened, someone HAS to do it
<ValtheJean> sounds good to me, I love Samurai Jack
<Octavia> 13Ahh... we prefer you still around at least a few movie nights first.
<HaysforPonies> It's like...a must
<johnsey> Filter: people are shipping everything, no exceptions
<MetalRainbowDash> Do I just ask for an application
<mib_1d9wxw> do it fool
*Orangestar starts playing video, didn't realize the volume was like, all the way up, suddenly: "DON'T YOU KNOW A STITCH IN TIME SAVES NINE?" blaring all throughout the house.
<johnsey> they're like UPS or something
<GGgala> rape averted!
<DecapKing> it starts with a /
<DesertRose> ok
<VanillaKites> toooo slow...
<DesertRose> hi
<DesertRose> :D
<Rainbow_Dash> You can type /quit and log in again
<Filter> ...
<Fluttershy> It was something easy... e-e;
<Octavia> 13You just ask for an application, yes.
<madponyking> I know this is completely unrelated to anything but who here misses Bleach from the first season?... You know, back when it was ghostbustin/slice of life...
<Xiagu> >nopony john maddens or even aeious
<Filter> thats what pheal is for
<Xiagu> what has happened to this channel

<Ziltoid> The first season of bleach is great
<Orangestar> 999999999999...

<MetalRainbowDash> I'll say "Can I have an application"
<sixthgate> im needing some help
<Wrek> 05on cartoon network abck at where i lived as a kid
<madponyking> It was awesomeness
<Octavia> 13But we do prefer our applicants to have some familiarity with us.Being here for several BMN's and such of course.
<Xiagu> Keyframe, she did the picture in the background
<HaysforPonies> Here comes another Chinese earthquake aahhbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
<ValtheJean> I don't think I ever saw the ending to it
<Luna> 07Octa I was talking with Ghosties and Wrek... about a poster or banner or something for the special pony marathon.. I was wondering if you would be up for it
<Stomper> lol
<GGgala> herospirit: i got an Abraham and Isaac allusion if you still need it
<Sumica> It was banshed from my drives after it became filler after filler.
<VanillaKites> I do Bleach before Aizen turned evil was the best!
<Keyframe> Yea...

<sixthgate> hello i have a question!
<MetalRainbowDash> I kinda like this.
<Nashy> Could have some nicer images, some less bare formatting and perhaps some more options/tweaks to lists.
<Octavia> 13How do you mean?
<madponyking> too bad Tite Kubo dose not seem too interested in bringing back that feel fromt the first season...
<HaysforPonies> Big American TTS
<AllisZero> He's not
<DJMidli|Writin> Sketchy_Sounds you take some buck and some manure and some buck and some manure and you have a buck manuer stack.

<HaysforPonies> Ponies distracted you
<MetalRainbowDash> Sumica
<MetalRainbowDash> I sent an email to BronyState@Gmail.com
<HaysforPonies> Ponies can even distract you from ponies.
<MetalRainbowDash> asking for application
<VanillaKites> oh nice thats perfect
<Luna> 07Yea thats why I asked if he attended any movie nights
<mib_1d9wxw> is it common for people to be engaged in japan?
<sixthgate> sooo on the 17th at 6 in the morning?
<VanillaKites> I can watch S2 right before swim
<Sumica> Ok MetalRainbowDash but i just run the stream i am not a mod.

<herospirit> Naw, just got one
<madponyking> its gona Rule!
<Orangestar> wait
<Sketchy_Sounds> Claro De Luna.
<Octavia> 13He needs more familiarity with us first.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Go read it.
<Octavia> 13At least 3 BMN's.
<Orangestar> now i remember, dang, ponies DID distract me from ponies.
<Octavia> 13Else, its strictly a no from me.
<Aponymous> What is this?
*Luna knows
<Wrek> 05with the way he has currently been acting, i agree qith oct
<Thunder_Dash> 17th at 4? I thought they were being streamed live
<herospirit> Got any to "The Loaves and Fishes"? :p
<VanillaKites> MECHATIME
<sixthgate> i may or may not have class or something to do, so im trying to set up my camstudio to record it
<Wrek> 05qith*
<Sumica> It's called Star driver
<Octavia> http://i.imgur.com/th1ac.jpg
<Wrek> 05WITH*
<Octavia> 13Especially considering he was a little bit of a trouble maker at first I noticed.
<^Stargazer> hahaha, DJ Pon3 and Octavia turned into hamspters XD
<^Stargazer> http://browse.deviantart.com/?q=Octavia%20Pony&order=9&offset=408#/d486sf2
<Aponymous> Cool name.
<HaysforPonies> The cycle of pony
<Luna> 07Yes, he was
<MetalRainbowDash> Oh ok
<RainbowDashCancel> Ponies can distract you from ponies, which can distract you from ponies, which can distract you from ponies...
*^Stargazer continues searching for random pictures
<Octavia> 13So I'm already saying no.ZS
<Octavia> 13*XD
<sixthgate> so are they streaming it live or what? @_@ so confused
<Sumica> I belive we are going to have a recorded re run later the same day sixthgate but i dont know the time.
<RainbowDashCancel> BWAAAAAAAAAWWWWMMMM! (Inception)
<DecapKing> MFW watching this saps the living shit out of my download speed
<MetalRainbowDash> Sumica btw can you at least just stream In Action by onNeutral after this
<Thunder_Dash> Ohhhhhh, I see
<sixthgate> oooh ok then thank you!
<MetalRainbowDash> That is, whenever this is over.
<Octavia> 13But I figured I'd give him the address to ask for one anyway cause I'm super-nice like that. :P
<Orangestar> wait why does he have a graynbow dash mane?
<sixthgate> i think ill just set up my cam to record all day XD
<Blums> I read claro de luna
<ValtheJean> well and even if we reject him
<Blums> felt nothing.
<HaysforPonies> Wait I must know if I'm distracted or not.
<ValtheJean> someone who might have been THINKING about it now has the info
*HaysforPonies spins the top thingy.
<Blums> is monster =D
<Octavia> 13Now... whats this about the promotional banners? I don't have Wrek's uber leet computer drawing skills. :P
<Sumica> I have to check over to see what it is before I run it MetalRainbowDash
<Octavia> 13Indeed Val.
<ValtheJean> it's never a bad idea to remind chat that we're recruiting
<VanillaKites> pretty...
<MetalRainbowDash> Ok.
<MetalRainbowDash> :O they said hey hey hey in English.
<DesertRose> hey look. someone coloured that female dragon arty that faust made
<DesertRose> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/55448
<Luna> 07Well Wrek's his hands are pretty much tight with the banners...
<HaysforPonies> Oh dear. It seems I still am.
<VioletVanilla> 6Well Octavia, you did say that you enjoyed doing that but felt overlooked. Thought maybe you would like to work on it. . .
<DecapKing> Dari
<AllisZero> I do like the song in the background
<sixthgate> lol he broke the 4th wall
<Luna> 07^
<DesertRose> looks more like a fish with wings now
<Aponymous> He... broke through the sky?
<DecapKing> woz 'ere apparently
<sixthgate> XD
<Sumica> make him stop bugging me >_<
<Thunder_Dash> I've heard that saying phrases/words in English is somewhat popular in Japan
<Luna> 07What Violet said!
<RainbowDashCancel> Right now in my browser, I have 8 pony-related tabs open
<RainbowDashCancel> 1 facebook tab open
<CarrotTop> why does the EqD submission rules page hate OCs so much? I like OCs
<RainbowDashCancel> and 1 Final Fantasy tab open
<AllisZero> Galactic pretty boy
<mib_1d9wxw> move those hips
<HaysforPonies> More sparkle than Twilight Sparkle.
<CarrotTop> does everyone but me and OC writers hate OCs
<Sketchy_Sounds> I have one tab open. It's Equestria Daily.
<sixthgate> OMG he went super saian!
<VanillaKites> learning it is mandatory in school in Japan
<Blums> the positioning of that dragon makes it look like a sea-dragon
<Xiagu> CarrotTop, nearly, apparently
<Thunder_Dash> It is? Didn't know that
<HaysforPonies> I think it's because it's to avoid Mary Sues/Gary Stus
<madponyking> Thunder_Dash thats true in most langueges...
<AllisZero> It's mandatory but they do a poor job at it haha
<herospirit> Space is invisible mind dust, and stars are but WISHEEEES!
<VanillaKites> I'm pretty sure, could be wrong I guess
<mook> !link http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/55080
<DerpyBot> Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
<sixthgate> SEE? his hair is blond now! hes supersaian!
<AllisZero> It's mandatory to get into university too
<Dashite> You can tell by the horrible English accent. :p
<Xiagu> ...
<Thunder_Dash> oh, ok
*^Stargazer is sad pony
<Xiagu> wut
<MetalRainbowDash> National Anthem
<MetalRainbowDash> i g2 stand
<HaysforPonies> And sadly people who just make additional original characters for the story get put in the same group.
<mook> probably because it's .org
<DecapKing> yup
<MetalRainbowDash> k
<HaysforPonies> I thought that guy on the right was John Oliver a moment.
<Ziltoid> ITZAH PINCHE
<herospirit> ITSAPEENCH
<^Stargazer> I made an OC just so I can be myself... =/
<VanillaKites> lol
<Sumica> lol
<Aponymous> I'm guessing sky breaking blonde dude is the bad guy? Or is it the other way around?
<Sumica> You guys rememberd it
<sixthgate> lol itsapeench
<sixthgate> XD
<herospirit> Other way
<AllisZero> Ither way around
<Thunder_Dash> other way around, I think
<Orangestar> Does yourself as a pony count as an OC?
<VanillaKites> sky breaker is good
<Wrek> 05yeah im pretty much tied up for long enough that when i get my hadns free, its too little time to mix something together
<herospirit> Red/blonde is good
<Xiagu> also, at that ponibooru link, giant trollface.
<sixthgate> the one that LOOKS evil usualy is XD
<MetalRainbowDash> Is this 30 minutes?
<herospirit> Because he has a PEENCH
<MetalRainbowDash> How long has it been going
<Aponymous> Okay.
<Thunder_Dash> also I said ITSAPEEINCH earlier D:
<Sumica> Red is hero guy in japan
<madponyking> Damn... Im getting so much lag I just cant enjoy this!
<VanillaKites> sames
<sixthgate> daphuk? his arms are galexies?
<AllisZero> MIKURU BEAAAAAM
<Thunder_Dash> it's not lagging too badly for me
<sixthgate> *armpits
<herospirit> It helps if you close your browser and come back, but that takes a bit.
<madponyking> its like every 5 seconds it laggs up!
<VanillaKites> it homes!
<WhatPayne> Well good night everypony, I'm well past my bedtime.
<redd> meh
<MetalRainbowDash> Bai
<VanillaKites> gnight
<herospirit> night Payne!
<redd> homework sucks
<madponyking> gnight!
<Thunder_Dash> Seeya Payne
<Sumica> is every one geting spikes or just a few?
<Aponymous> Bye Payne
<sixthgate> goodnight! may luna shine on you! XD
<WhatPayne> until tomorrow
<JackiePie> :(
<VanillaKites> lol
<Orangestar> I FEEL YOUR PAIN
<sixthgate> *princess luna XD
<AllisZero> I'm getting spikes here and there, Sumica
<Orangestar> whoopscaps
<Luna> 07You rang?
<MetalRainbowDash> Sumica is this almost over?
<JackiePie> What kind of homework?
<AllisZero> They aren't too bad though
*HaysforPonies is doing a shipload of notes.
<redd> specially when ur parents took away ur comuter, but u smuggle it
<HaysforPonies> ...Me/notes. Oh dear.
<DecapKing> hey Luna
<sixthgate> lol i ment prinsess luna XD
<Octavia> 13Ahh. I don't really have the proper things on me right now to do anything like what Wrek does. I'm a good designer, but I lack most suitable applications atm for actual drawing. And a tablet.
<Orangestar> Redd,
<Luna> 07hello
<VanillaKites> PRETTY BOY WINS!!!
<Orangestar> are you me?
<CarrotTop> I honestly haven't ever read a fic and said "this character's a mary sue I don't like them"
<redd> no why
<sixthgate> THA FOX IS ADORIBLE!!
<Thunder_Dash> of course, he's a bishonen
<AllisZero> WASH THOSE HANDS
<sixthgate> a whaaa?
<Orangestar> Because you sound like it
<MetalRainbowDash> Oh there
<JackiePie> redd I just want to know what homework your doing, in the extremely unlikely chance I'd be able to help.
<redd> Orangestar? whut
<ValtheJean> well if you'd like I could take a shot at it, what did you have in mind?
<MetalRainbowDash> The credits told me
<VanillaKites> 2 laggy I missed the cuteness D=
<sixthgate> those t3 sttanding there remind me of samurai shamploo
<DecapKing> FMP now?
<HaysforPonies> CarrotTop: I'm also considering another fanfic to write that will have an OC or two. But neither of them are in any way based off of me.
<redd> okay, im doing sentence notes
<MetalRainbowDash> Btw if u stream it I bet you'd like it
<MetalRainbowDash> It's a little thing onNeutral does
<AllisZero> I can go for some FMP!
<redd> simple subject=?
<Orangestar> Oh please don't make an advance wars reference
<JackiePie> Alright
<Octavia> 13Poor Sumica. That MRD guy is pretty annoying. :/
<JackiePie> uh so just notes
<Wrek> 05even if you cant make a final product oct
<redd> simple pred= ?
<MetalRainbowDash> He does some virus reviews while it's happening in Action
<CarrotTop> the current fanfiction I'm writing's main characters are Carrot Top and Dewdrop Dazzle
<madponyking> Samurai Champloo was indeed awesome...
<JackiePie> That does sound boring
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> PONY
<Wrek> 05coming up with a neat idea
<redd> meh
<MetalRainbowDash> onNeutral's In Action!
<Lysiria> ponyponypony.swf
<GGgala> damn chavs, always vandalizin' the place.
<sixthgate> i liked the episode before last
<Wrek> 05skethcing it up etc
<redd> my parentss too away my comp
<CarrotTop> which are pretty much OCs because they have no characterization otherwise
<Wrek> 05all of that
<Wrek> 05would we of awesoem
<redd> but i stole it bac
<Octavia> 13Well, we could talk about what we'd like.
<VanillaKites> will it be this laggy on Saturday?
<MetalRainbowDash> WINDOWS XP SOUND
<Xiagu> CarrotTop, ponies don't mind those as much for some reason
<Sumica> it's not a matter of liking it MetalRainbowDash it's I have to preview it so I know what i am showing.
<Orangestar> I'm doing Advanced Geometry
<MetalRainbowDash> :o
<Octavia> 13Hmm.. a pony poster for the marathon..
<MetalRainbowDash> Ok
<ValtheJean> I've had an idea for a bronystate image for a while now, just never started making one
<Orangestar> I have my laptop that I smuggled in last night
<redd> wut
<sixthgate> BOOBS
<GGgala> Oh lol. nope. I had the spy show /Alias/ , s02e21, "Legacy" - what'd you find?
<JackiePie> I feel parents who try to punish their kids by taking away their things, just teach their children mistrust and disrepect of others.
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Some OCs are popular
<ValtheJean> basically all the mane cast + popular background characters in a movie theater
<HaysforPonies> I have to ask, was there some fanfic incident where an OC was without a doubt a self-insert?
<GGgala> ...s03e21
<redd> my parents stole it, so i stole it back
<sixthgate> cone....
<CarrotTop> background characters are OCs with predefined color schemes and hair
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Like that one black one on ponibooru
<MetalRainbowDash> :O
<CarrotTop> as far as using them as characters
<JackiePie> I mean if a child freels powerless at home, it's more likely they'll bully at school to regain that power.
<MetalRainbowDash> HI CONE!
<Luna> 07It needs to relate to the pony marathon ;)
<AllisZero> Woot
<ValtheJean> like Pinkie having mounds of candy with her, Twilight talking over the movie, etc
<sixthgate> oooh full metal panic....whats this about?
<MetalRainbowDash> :(
<Xiagu> >That black one // Nyx?
<MetalRainbowDash> Why are we looking at Japanese stuff?
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Nyx?
<DecapKing> giant robots thats what
<VanillaKites> this anime...
<HaysforPonies> Or are they just strict to AVOID self-insert fictions getting submitted all over the place?
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Possibly
<madponyking> adult bank= sperm bank...
<sixthgate> lol
<redd> halp
<Duskfly> What's your prediction in how many people will show up for the starting episode?
<sixthgate> anime ftw
<Xiagu> !link nyx the_truth
<DecapKing> giant robots thats why
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<Sumica> unless every one is geting lots of lag I am inclined to belive it's not on my end
<Luna> 07and yes he is..
<Xiagu> whaarghbll
<DecapKing> and guns
<redd> i neeeed answers
<AllisZero> sixthgate: It's about a guy who's been in combat zones since a kid, and he has no idea how normal society works
<ValtheJean> yeah that wouldn't work then >.<
<redd> pleease
<herospirit> I got "Abraham and Isaac: Sacrifice at Gettysburg" :p
<MetalRainbowDash> OH SHIT
<Thunder_Dash> getting a little bit here
<redd> be a nice mufin
<AllisZero> Hilarity ensues when he has to go to high school
<Octavia> 13I like Val's idea, its decent. Have the view from the theater screen. Y'know, the camera pointing to them sitting in the audiance.
<madponyking> Imma getting so much lag it hurts...
<VanillaKites> I could nver get into it because of the drawing style of this one =/
<AllisZero> Also kickass giant robots
<MetalRainbowDash> NUDE PERSON
<redd> and give e my answers
<sixthgate> giant robots and giant boobs go together so well
*Orangestar goes back to tvtropes "Sorry, can't help you"
<redd> :(
<Octavia> 13It kinda relates I think.
<JackiePie> What about looking them up on the web?
<DecapKing> i already said robots
<AllisZero> ALSO
<AllisZero> TESSA
<redd> meh
<Luna> 07Sumica?
<Octavia> 13Though not specifically.
<AllisZero> Oh man, Tessa <3
<redd> i uessss
<VanillaKites> also the robots =)
<AllisZero> I had almost forgotten how moe she is
<Wrek> 05like the thign i sketched for sathi while i was on vacation? :o
<redd> whats a simple subject
<Luna> 07It's lagging
<Octavia> 13Maybe that idea would be best for a main banner for the site. lol
<Fluttershy> Tessa could be Fluttersh... >w>;
<Luna> 07my kitty?
<Luna> 07:D
<Fluttershy> Fluttershy*
<DecapKing> bullshit, they were dead by then
<Fluttershy> xp
<Octavia> 13Did I miss something? lol
<Fluttershy> Can't spell my own name.
<sixthgate> OMG i need advide!!
<redd> dont like this
<Orangestar> it's like, in the sentance "Tom went to the store.
<dashie> maybe...
<DecapKing> i mean thats what, 1800 years?
<AllisZero> She could totally be Fluttershy
<sixthgate> *advice
<madponyking> sixthgate Just look at tengen toppa...
<redd> haha!
<Wrek> 05i drew a movie theater with the mane 6 in 6 seats in frotn of the screen
<Orangestar> The sentance is about Tom
<redd> my name is tom
<Orangestar> so- oh wow
<Orangestar> but anyway
<Octavia> 13Mustve missed that one.
<AllisZero> Should stream Fumoffu
<Sumica> feh i ran this ep already.
<MetalRainbowDash> Sumica is there any way you can stop the stream and look at onNeutral?
<Wrek> 05with the red drapes
<Wrek> 05only showed it to sathi
<Orangestar> The sentance is about tom, so the simple subject is tom
<MetalRainbowDash> Or.
<AllisZero> Everypony loves Fumoffu
<MetalRainbowDash> ..
<AllisZero> EVERYPONY
<RainbowDashCancel> Yeah, what Orange said.
<Wrek> 05and thiw was like, early july
<GGgala> wow, just the title makes me lol forever
<Octavia> 13Awww. DX
<sixthgate> no no so ive been trying to convert my friends to watch MLP with me, but
<Xiagu> redd, also, google is awesome
<dashie> I want to watch fma :1
<Fluttershy> You can't understand Fumoffu at all though unless you watch regular FMP first. o-o
<VanillaKites> well I'm gonna finish catching up on Fallout EQ cyas everypony
<sixthgate> ive only had one sucessfull convert
<RainbowDashCancel> Basically, the main subject of the sentence
<GGgala> that's up there with Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter
<Thunder_Dash> it's starting to lag quite a bit for me now, too...
<DecapKing> Fuck my connection
<Orangestar> In a sentence like: "The Great and Powerful Trixie went to preform", the simple subject would be "Trixie", and the subject would be "The great and powerful trixie"
<Wrek> 05was about over a month between that i drew it and actually applied for a mod status
<MetalRainbowDash> FOr me too.
<Xiagu> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/46534

<Thunder_Dash> I told my friend "this sounds ridiculous, but it's actually a good show" and then showed him Derpy's original appearance as well as hers in Ep15 :P

<Octavia> 13I still basically see Octi as my OC, so I guess I already have one. lol

<Octavia> 13All the ponies be starin at Val's plot. :P
<Luna> 07Well Val / Octa.. if you can't maybe we could ask Fluttershy

<MetalRainbowDash> Episode number

<MetalRainbowDash> In Season 1
<madponyking> the name was look before you sleep...
<dashie> *everyone opens youtube*
<TrollightSparkle> Lol
<Octavia> 13Ah, its worth a shot. She might.
<MetalRainbowDash> And the episode #?
<madponyking> but cant remember the number...
<MetalRainbowDash> #
<madponyking> 11?
<dashie> 9?
<Bufurd> 8 look before you sleep
<Wrek> 05im still sad i never finished the LOTR event one
<Luna> 07But that banner idea Val had, I like it
<madponyking> lol
<^Stargazer> huh, interesting to note
<HaysforPonies> Chrome, why you go boom?
<Octavia> 13I've not seen any of her work. But I bet she'd do fine.
<Bufurd> thankyou mlp-fim.com
<ValtheJean> :D
<Wrek> 05i had such a huge concept in mind
<madponyking> cheater
<dashie> xD
<Wrek> 05ive seen ehr work
<MetalRainbowDash> Correct Answer: Episode 8 - Look Before You Sleep
<Octavia> 13Me too. As the sites main banner.
<Wrek> 05she can do it
<ValtheJean> in the end, tis your call Master :P
<MetalRainbowDash> All of you were close.
<Sumica> oki back online.
<TrollightSparkle> Nobody ever said you COULDN'T use YouTube.. or Google >.>
<madponyking> I got half of it right!
<MetalRainbowDash> Sumica
<MetalRainbowDash> Can u look at In Action?
<RainbowDashCancel> I thought one of Chrome's advertising/selling/marketing/whatever points was that it doesn't go boom
<NewDCDAlbark> 9In other news
<NewDCDAlbark> 9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmFEXNpmCLA&t=01m07s
<RainbowDashCancel> well at least when it was still in it's beta stage
<NewDCDAlbark> 9you are now seeing this in your mind every time I perform a ban
<RainbowDashCancel> pre 1.0
*Applejack finishes another Tengen Toppa episode and joins this chat once again
<Xiagu> RainbowDashCancel, I think most browsers try to have that as their selling point
<Applejack> Howdy there
*MetalRainbowDash :(
<dashie> huh
<Orangestar> And firefox 4 fails big time
<Sumica> MetalRainbowDash pleas give it a rest, I said i would look at it.
<TrollightSparkle> In other news, I, for one, am glad to welcome our new Pony Overlords.
<DecapKing> now there's more lag for me....
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol DCD, when you gonna stream that smexyness again? :P
*MetalRainbowDash begs Sumica to take a look at In Action
<Luna> 07I was just brain-storming :)
<Sketchy_Sounds> They're up to 6 now.
<RainbowDashCancel> umm...firefox has been on 6 for a while now
<MetalRainbowDash> Oh ok
<RainbowDashCancel> yeah
<NewDCDAlbark> 9hopefully during my birthday
<NewDCDAlbark> 9even if I have a lot of stuff to study
<AllisZero> Tessa doesn't have boobs that big
<Howling_Griffon> i disagree
<Sketchy_Sounds> For some bizarre reason they suddenly got the idea that using Chrome's version numbering standard was a great idea.
<Sumica> Trying not to rage, must love and tolorate.
<madponyking> HEEEEYYYY... Check This OUUUT: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEYR5O0PNpM
<Applejack> lol THAT anime
<Orangestar> I wouldn't know, I use chrome, and when my computer bricked, I just started useing an ubuntu live cd with firefox 3 on it
<Xiagu> cause Mozilla was like ``screw normal version numbers! Everyone else is on like 11! We're behind!''
<Applejack> ooo Fighting is magic =D
<Xiagu> so they went to 5 and then 6 in like a month
<Xiagu> nightly's on 9, I think
<Octavia> 13I have the image in my mind and it looks perdy. lol
<Sketchy_Sounds> Yeah basically, Xiagu.
<MetalRainbowDash> Check this out ppl http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUxchZUSaSM
<dashie> weee I can't wait to that game to come out!
<ValtheJean> lol
<Octavia> 13Lmao. :P
*Applejack agrees with dashie
<JackiePie> I just read there have been power outages in California
<Howling_Griffon> i find it painfully ironic that i was just drawing some giant pony mecha when i find FMP running on bronystate XD
<RainbowDashCancel> in Arizona as well
<dashie> im kinda sucky in fighting games but, I'll get better just for this one
<Fluttershy> back!
<Applejack> FUMOFFU
<RainbowDashCancel> Wonder if Nevada and Utah got anything
<NewDCDAlbark> 9wait what, FMP?
<dashie> yey
<NewDCDAlbark> 9>loads the stream
<MetalRainbowDash> The link I sent above the YT video is In Action
<Orangestar> btw rdc, I like the prisim shirt best
<Applejack> howdy there Fluttershy
<MetalRainbowDash> it's some good videos
<NewDCDAlbark> 9sweet
<Orangestar> prism*
<AllisZero> Yes, DCD
<Applejack> eeyup
<Sumica> I never see any one giving you so much flack for programing Luna >_<
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so DCD, is there any word of that PSP SRW game being ported to America? or shall it forever remain Japan only?
<NewDCDAlbark> 9I really should finish watching this series
<AllisZero> I thought this was your doing
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's silly, because with the amount of revising that goes on with Firefox, they'll be on version 1000 or something daft like that in no time.
<NewDCDAlbark> 9oh hey I had watched this episode
<NewDCDAlbark> 9forever ajapn
<Howling_Griffon> behold. tessa. the best lolita evar (subjective)
*ValtheJean 2,14 cries
<NewDCDAlbark> 9Val
<JackiePie> A prisim shirt, sounds like Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon
<Fluttershy> Oh hi Applejack! ^^
<DecapKing> well
<RainbowDashCancel> Would you say it's *puts on sunglasses*
<JackiePie> No derpy I didn't mean that...
<JackiePie> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, JackiePie!
<VioletVanilla> 6My cutie mark would be something. . . . not sure what though. . .
<Wrek> 05why the cry cal?
<MetalRainbowDash> It's about some person reviewing computer viruses in action
<ValtheJean> that is for 2 reasons
<NewDCDAlbark> 9I'm hoping OG2 PS3 comes statesside though
<NewDCDAlbark> 9here
<MetalRainbowDash> as they're infecting.
<Applejack> :D
<Wrek> 05val*
<RainbowDashCancel> 20 PERCENT COOLER?!
<RainbowDashCancel> YEAAAAAAHHHHHHH
<AllisZero> Ugh, now the stream is being worse to me
<ValtheJean> 1) because anime isn't nearly as well received
<madponyking> Damn This lag. Damn This Lag To Hell.
<Sumica> Oh hi DCD
<Mason_Trowel> I'm in Northern Nevada. No power outage in my area.
<ValtheJean> 2) everyone loves Luna by default :P

<Octavia> 13The end of civilization as we know it, VV!
<roushguy> Well that was weird.
<Luna> 07<Fluttershy> Hmmm well one ideas would to be to draw the mane 6 ponies plus as many side characters as possible all sitting in theater seats, some with popcorn, some with drinks, their faces aglow from the screen as they all make their various comments on it?
<MetalRainbowDash> Laggin
<ValtheJean> I just love watching the robots do flashy animation while hearing some Japanese VA shout nonsense
<roushguy> My internet decided to go on the fritz
<NewDCDAlbark> 9also Val

<NewDCDAlbark> 9that if Caramel ever appeared in them
<Sketchy_Sounds> Making Derpy doubleflip isn't that difficult.
<Wrek> 05we all are
<madponyking> maybe now it will lag less...
<Orangestar> You know, I never really consider myself a "brony," per se. I like the show, but don't really participate much in fan followings...
<DecapKing> must, not, say.....
<JackiePie> Then you call Comcast, "Oh yeah, we were working on the internet then, didn't ya know?" -_-'
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no idea what Battle for Equestria is
*Applejack realizes her farm lacks eletricity

<johnsey> there are quite a few commands using times actually
<Octavia> 13Octavia needs to be in there too, of course. ;)
<Howling_Griffon> i liked the hitler dub MLP series
<Applejack> Give this lag THE STARE, it might work >=)

<Thunder_Dash> still lagging for me, too
<Wrek> 05such a scene
<RainbowDashCancel> May Luna guide you, johnsey
<madponyking> How about I shoot this lag in the face with my golden magnum?
<Wrek> 05I think would be alot more fitting
<Wrek> 05for a mian banner
<Wrek> 05main*
<Octavia> 13A bubble each coming from OCti and Vinyl bantering what the other said, might be funny.
<^Stargazer> she does the impossible now lol
<MetalRainbowDash> Tomorrow he'll play some MLP
<Wrek> 05or site art
<Howling_Griffon> im gonna love and tolerate this lag with my Meltagun
<Octavia> 13Thats what I said too Wrek.
<Sketchy_Sounds> She's talented, that gal.
<ValtheJean> Caramel has to have this dumbfounded look as he searches for his favorite candy, which has just been swiped by his trolling sister: Toffee
<Applejack> darn it, dis lag's sure tough >=C
<Wrek> 05it has way too much potential for a single event
<Fluttershy> Grrr....
<RainbowDashCancel> Derpy has afterimages
<Mason_Trowel> That's why she's the mailmare. ^_^
<AllisZero> Dat song
<Fluttershy> BAD LAG!

<RainbowDashCancel> Oh snap, Derpy can control time to increase her speed

<Fluttershy> -gasps, falls over, twitching-
<MetalRainbowDash> Chanserv
<MetalRainbowDash> ChanServ
<Sumica> you still all geting it or is it the vocal few?

<herospirit> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4W7Ff7Pf58&feature=related
<madponyking> bye telofy
<HaysforPonies> All we need is space control and she can be an unstoppable deity.
<Mason_Trowel> Wouldn't that make her the pony version of The Flash?
*DecapKing pokes Fluttershy
*Applejack bucks the lag even harder
*DecapKing pokes Fluttershy again
<Wrek> 05the concept might not be as fitting
<Octavia> 13Oh, I didnt mean for anyone in particular to do it. Just the idea.
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Key Chains and Ponies With Suitcases (http://tinyurl.com/3d9zoqe)

*madponyking watches as the lag slowly consumes all...
<RainbowDashCancel> Well that also sorta gives Derpy the ability to teleport
<Fluttershy> I did my best... but it's so... laggy...
<Keyframe> ... You know I'm glad I skimmed that
<Octavia> 13Its a little broad and big for just the marathon S1 stream honestly. But it would make a great site main banner.
<Keyframe> That was just bad...
<ValtheJean> anything with Caramel and Toffee will instantly make me squee :P
*DecapKing pokes Fluttershy again
<AllisZero> This is the kid that goes Seed mode for panties
<AllisZero> They do LOL
<madponyking> awww...

*dashie can't believe these ponies are crazy
*Applejack uses her lasso to bind DecapKing
<madponyking> hey! How do i change my name to something else?
*DecapKing pokes Applejack again
<Sketchy_Sounds> Is it just me, or does Twi look bald in the pic of her in that post?

<Denied_Existence> 3...
<Wrek> 05Our "text logo" i.e BronyState in the center fix, surounded by first of the mane 6 and snacks etc. and then jsut focus on the mane 6 for this one. perhaps add a few fitting themes and such. And then save our "theater" Idea for an eventual new banner of the main site, and or stream wrapper. so to summarize: simple yet neat for the event. save the fantastic herdmind idea of the theater
<Denied_Existence> 3Was ist das...?
<RainbowDash> Yay! My name is diferent!

<roushguy> And have some of my less-understanding family members and friends look at me wierd
<Octavia> 13Sounds like a good idea.

<roushguy> Weird*
<RainbowDash> Prove it... in ten seconds flat...

<HoneyWhistle> !muffin
<brony_v> RainbowJack sounds like a fabulous pirate, imo.
*DerpyBot regurgitates a whole, fresh looking muffin and approaches mexican, showing her most adorable kissing face
<Applejack> O.o
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<mexican> ^3^
<mexican> yes
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Herospirit.. Why would you post that D=
<Rainbow_Dash> 11iSad
<Mason_Trowel> Well, I don't go around saying, "I'm a brony, join the herd." but I don't bother hiding the few toys I've gotten and the art I've drawn in my room.
<HoneyWhistle> !muffins
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
*Mongoose trots in with a dead bird in his mouth
<HoneyWhistle> Yes, I have honey muffins.
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
<RainbowDash> sooooo.... wich is better?
*DerpyBot glomps HoneyWhistle
<herospirit> So Fluttershy could make it better. D:
<Blums> no sense in forcing everypony else into hearing you singing mlp songs when they dont want to.
<VioletVanilla> 6Dayjob orchestra Wrek? c;
*Mongoose he then drops it in front of CogWeaver
<Octavia> 13We rock? Woo hoo~

<Hat> RainbowJack
<Octavia> 13I knew VV was gonna chime in with that. ;)
<Fluttershy> -hugs Rainbow_Dash- please cheer up! ;_;
<Xiagu> Blums, isn't that how the herd grows, though?
<RainbowDash> Alrighty then...
<Luna> 07yay?

<brony_v> I'm going to have to go with the pirate :P
<Fooby> I'm going to have a giant pony poster in my room soon \o/
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Maybe I will once I have these files downloaded
<mexican> as they all have no idea what im singing
<Rainbow_Dash> 11>.<
<Applejack> see? :D
<Mongoose> People don't know about my bronyism
<DecapKing> i had a feeling that a hug would work
<Octavia> 13Do we want to put the logo in a small screen?
<Blums> well it also lessens your chances of converting them if you do it every. day.
<Wrek> 05i think it wont be in a cinema per se, it would jsut feature the text with the mane 6 around it posed differently and popcorn and soda all around
<Mongoose> But I don't hide it
<Fluttershy> -hyperventilates, then... passes out-
<Xiagu> Fooby, hell yes giant pony posters
<Xiagu> Fooby, what is it going to be a poster of?
<RainbowDash> Ten Our fusion shall be known as RAINBOWJACK!
<herospirit> I think... she's better now
<RainbowDash> *then
<Fooby> It was the title-picture of a drawfriend
<mexican> i think im going to draw RD in my wall
<Fooby> several drawfriends ago

<Mongoose> i got a rarity
<Pyroh> I wish the world would stop hating on bronies, It would make my life so much easier
<Xiagu> so... my friend's girlfriend bought me the pony bedspread
*DecapKing pulls a blanket out of his saddle bags
<Fooby> I'll take a picture once I put it together and hang it up -- I used BlockPosters to make it
<Fooby> Xiagu has bedspread? o:
*DecapKing puts the blanket on the passed out fluttershy
<Applejack> xD
<Mason_Trowel> Lucky colt, you.
*Xiagu is flamboyantly brony at college and NOBODY IS HATING ON HIM
<DecapKing> im going to just guess, no
<Pyroh> Ponies is now a good 30% of my life now, And it's a shame i have to hide it to avoid mocery and ridicule
<Luna> 07and we are back :)
<Xiagu> Fooby, I will have it by the end of the week, most likely
<RainbowDash> weeeeeeeee

<Efreet> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 8d:11h:37m:18s
<Applejack> still a little laggy but...bettah ^^
<ValtheJean> maybe we should just say "go with whatever you as an artist feel looks right"?
<Xiagu> Plorf, UMD
<RainbowDash> ok
<Efreet> ;o
<ColtPhelps> @muffin
<Applejack> or not...
<Sumica> If this dosent work then I am calling up embark to rage then order better/faster bandwidth in the morning.

<Xiagu> Pyroh, who the hell is going to ridicule you for watching the show?
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Pyroh> I need to hide some things
<ColtPhelps> yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps ColtPhelps
<Sidestroke> Too long.
<Plorf> You were in the Magnet program, right?
<Pyroh> Or i am teased
<Wrek> 05you have our general thoughts and ideas, from ehre you do what you think is best
<Mongoose> My School is pretty damn tolerant
<Plorf> That's kind of the home school for that
<Octavia> 13Could have the whole background be a giant screen with "BronyState" on it and covered up a bit by the ponies in the foreground. *shrugs*
<Wrek> 05also, VioletVanilla
<Wrek> 05http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir3aqD5w4qs
<Mongoose> Teasing is not too common
<Pyroh> But if anyone were to ask i would agree to being a watcher of ponies
<RainbowDash> this lag better clear up soon... or we might have some trouble with season 2...
<Xiagu> Plorf, yep, unlike apparently 90% of the internet, my high school didn't suck ass
<Pyroh> Nor do i lower my voice when i talk of ponies
<Mongoose> Same here Xiagu
<brony_v> I didn't get here until just as the last show cut out, so I can't really compare lag before/after...
<Plorf> My bro was a magnet, and did a ton of stuff
<Luna> 07it's still laggy....
<RainbowDash> aah...
<Octavia> 13lol
<Plorf> And somehow didn't get into UMD
<Luna> 07We had a perfect streaming tv test
<RainbowDash> It was Toooataly laggy!
<Xiagu> Plorf, that's sort of sad unless he didn't apply
<Plorf> But did get into like, Carnegie Mellon, Drexel, Rensselaer
<Plorf> etc.
<Luna> 07liar!
<Xiagu> since like 99% of the magnet gets into umd
<Fluttershy> I wonder it it's just due to internet crowding or something along those lines... during certain times of day the internet just gets... laggy
<Plorf> He did apply
<Xiagu> wait. that story is familiar
*DecapKing pokes fluttershy
<Plorf> you know him apparently
<Plorf> I saw you on his Skype contacts xD
<Xiagu> I may know him
<RainbowDash> it was after we watched ... i think it was Jem...
*Applejack agrees with both RainbowDash and Fluttershy
<Mongoose> Well I'm gonna go
<Luna> 07Yem slowed us all down!
<Fluttershy> Burn Notice was working fine though too wasn't it?
<Mongoose> Night
<AllisZero> What time is it where you life Fluttershy?
<herospirit> I know how to wake up a Pony. Tell me if I should or not.
<Luna> 07yep

<Wrek> 05dat asnwer

<RainbowDash> (I got 10 bucks that say it is either disterbing pr0nz or viruses)
<Fluttershy> ValtheJean: Yay! Only 7 miles away from me! ^^
<brony_v> Weren't people getting kicked during Batman for posting links?
<ValtheJean> blarg, I'll go check it now :P
*roushguy pulls a tray full of muffins out, then starts loading them into a clearly overdesigned cannon shaped vaguely like a muffin.

<RainbowDash> thats the box thingy!
<VioletVanilla> 6Long answer, since she has only been around for about a week and 0 BMN's we thought it would be best if she familiarized herself better with the rules and BronyState as a whole before becoming a mod.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ah
<RainbowDash> can I get a sneak peak at some epic season 2 footage?
<MetalRainbowDash> The black (kinda unreadable)

<ValtheJean> I mean, I know I was saying we had to speed up the process and all :P

<VioletVanilla> 6It was the best night ever!
*roushguy pulls they object out and takes it over to a curtained-off counter.
<RainbowDash> okz
<Ghosties> 4Hi
<Fluttershy> TrollightSparkle: Oh really? I'm going to be going to the Anime con there in October. It's Anime Banzai. ^^

<ValtheJean> 2,14 way to be trollightsparkle, Utah Bronies unite!
<MetalRainbowDash> Soo yeah. That's the photo of the S2E1 DVD
<VioletVanilla> 6<3
<TrollightSparkle> :)
<MetalRainbowDash> http://www.image-upload.net/images/dup6xwjpwj2lhyetvwim_thumb.png
<TrollightSparkle> Que es Anime Banzai, btw?
<Plorf> This was the instant I became a brony
<MetalRainbowDash> :O
<Plorf> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivDAMr6GfHU
<RainbowDash> then were you just walkin down the street when suddenly... BOOM! Lauren Faust?
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Rainbow Dash - are you a spy?
<Ghosties> 4Hehe, it was like I was never there~ /peeping Tom
<MetalRainbowDash> Yeah.
<MetalRainbowDash> Are u a mind reader?
<VioletVanilla> 6D<
<RainbowDash> lol

*Applejack facehoofs
<RainbowDash> nope
<MetalRainbowDash> Yes.
<Octavia> 13Wait... that MetalRainbowDash says hes friends with Lauren?
<MetalRainbowDash> Cuz u knew what kinda happened.
*VioletVanilla smacks Ghostie, but her hoof goes through him.
<Luna> 073 girls and a ghost sounds funny for a cartoon!
<^Stargazer> my favorite pinkie pie moment is when she and RD are preping to prank spike
<VioletVanilla> 6IT'S LIKE MAGIC!
<RainbowDash> wow... seriously?
<^Stargazer> I dunno why, but the animation where she looks between her hooves always looked really good
<MetalRainbowDash> :O NOBODY CARES THAT I HAVE A DVD OF SEASON 2 EPISODE 1?!?
<MetalRainbowDash> And yes.
<RainbowDash> I cares!
*ValtheJean still feels betrayed. Is now going back to his promise to never hug Luna again :P
<Fluttershy> anyyywaaay I need to brb ><
<MetalRainbowDash> Don't believe me of the S2E1 DVD? Look at this photo I took
<MetalRainbowDash> http://www.image-upload.net/images/dup6xwjpwj2lhyetvwim_thumb.png
<DecapKing> its quiet......
<Luna> 07WAAAT :'(
<Fluttershy> I'll be back asap tho!
*TrollightSparkle blackmails MetalRainbowDash for the S2E1 DVD
<VioletVanilla> 6That is the DVD cover. . . on the black market maybe <.<
<RainbowDash> Show some footage and we can know the truth...
*Luna goes back to her foreveralonecorner
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8JCX9E0bEI&NR=1 datdashface
<RainbowDash> yep
<MetalRainbowDash> How can I just put a dvd in and just stream it
<ValtheJean> if it makes you feel better, I'm adding Octavia and Violet to the list :P
<RainbowDash> VioletVanilla just what I thought!
<MetalRainbowDash> I have to rip the whole entire Part 1 and 2 which takes a while
<VioletVanilla> 6First off, if ANYPONY had a DVD of it, they would be shot by Lauren herself for spreading it around the internet.
<Razyn> 11Is it now?
*Xiagu /)^Îµ^(\
<DecapKing> nope
<TrollightSparkle> You buy it and next thing you know.. BAM! You're watching G1 Ponies.
<Razyn> 11Then make some noise.
<Octavia> 13Yeah...
<RainbowDash> lol
<MetalRainbowDash> It's a real DVD.
<^Stargazer> oh god that one loops lol
<RainbowDash> soooo... we shall never know the truth?
<Octavia> 13As a friend of someone who actually works on the show, I'm more than skeptical honestly.
<TrollightSparkle> Not JUST G1 Ponies, but G1 Ponies in Swedish :o
<Applejack> you've watched it?
<MetalRainbowDash> And you ppl just don't care that I have it
<MetalRainbowDash> Yes I have
<Ghosties> 4AHAHAH! It's like I'm not even there *rubs transparent hands together*
<MetalRainbowDash> I know what happens in the end.
<Octavia> 13Yeah...
<RainbowDash> lol
<MetalRainbowDash> But I can't tell you because it would count as a spoiler.
<^Stargazer> there's no real good clip of mine lol
*Octavia 13isnt even going to say anything
<MetalRainbowDash> And you probably wouldn't watch it when it comes on Sep. 17
<Brevity> yeah I cant think of a better way of putting this: who do I follow for episode torrents for season two?
<VioletVanilla> 6Secondly, to come bragging around a random Brony site would be less than smart for someone with that.
<RainbowDash> but I dont care about spoiler
<TrollightSparkle> I CARE
*DecapKing glomps Octavia for no real reason
<TrollightSparkle> *ahem* I care.
<Plorf> /)à² Îµà² (\

<ValtheJean> metalrainbowdash
<RainbowDash> I care to hear what you claim to be the ending to the 1 ep of season 2
*VioletVanilla picks a random pony to glomp.
<Thunder_Dash> the images aren't even showing up for me, I just see blank messages
<^Stargazer> they usually had hq video's the saturday after the episode aired
<Octavia> 13Metal... honestly, I think you're lying. But thats me.

<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Wario land 3 - World Map (Night)
<MetalRainbowDash> http://www.image-upload.net/images/dup6xwjpwj2lhyetvwim_thumb.png

<RainbowDash> good night...

<brony_v> Brb, spamming random brony's facebook wall with pony videos~
*VioletVanilla hugs RainbowDash

<Ghosties> 4I know we were considering him for app
<Luna> 07yea..is it only me?
<Octavia> 13Keek!
<MetalRainbowDash> Wow you people don't care.
<Wrek> 05got their names mixed then
<MetalRainbowDash> I fucking have A DVD
<Xiagu> ^Stargazer, we see him after learning about it for all of what, like, 30 seconds?
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/8376b98601fcfd0b5c1b3f4cb2c2bdce/55465%20-%20awesome%20fluttershy%20made_of_awesome.jpg
*RainbowDash is hugged and feels the friendship
<RainbowDash> bye bye
<TrollightSparkle> Why you kick Metal
<Octavia> 13That was an aweful photoshop.
<Wrek> 05and I will punish myself by watching http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7MXj0rpx18&feature=related
<VioletVanilla> 6I do care, I will just see it when we stream it live, RIGHT HERE ON BRONYSTATE THEATRE! ;D
<Octavia> 13I can tell from pixels, etc. Lmao
<Sumica> uhhh no clue, I thought i had it online.
<DecapKing> Kick
<Charlie_Horse> XD
<Luna> 07it says offline here
<Thunder_Dash> Looks like MS Paint, even
<^Stargazer> ?
<herospirit> May be right Thunder.
<Moongaze> Hello
<Octavia> 13And I actually DO have a friend who works on the show. I highly doubt hes friends with Lauren somehow.
<Brevity> well theres the obsessing over him during The Ticket Master, but he seems to have gotten over that. otherwise he was at the donut shop, so for all Spike knows shes available
<VioletVanilla> 6Hallo Moongaze!
<MetalRainbowDash> Ok so just for lying
*Applejack got to go as well, since her and RainbowDash study in the same school (HAHA!) c yall later (tomorrow...MAYBE) and she still doesn't believe in MetalRainbowDash story
<MetalRainbowDash> Your gonna kick me>
<Sketchy_Sounds> ^Stargazer: He probably already knew what Blueblood was like.
<MetalRainbowDash> Wowwwwwww.
<Sumica> guess it droped me.
<Octavia> 13Well, you shouldnt lie MRD >:|
<Octavia> 13Thats all.
<VioletVanilla> 6Alllright there AppleJack! <3 See you all later!
<Xiagu> Brevity, there's a cut at the donut shop, hiding the mane six describing how the night totally sucked for them
<herospirit> My gonna kick you?
<Octavia> 13We dont hate you or anything.
<DecapKing> i might
<MetalRainbowDash> Btw I thought from a view it looked KINDA real.
<^Stargazer> hum... never thought about that Sketchy
<MetalRainbowDash> Just about 15%
<^Stargazer> it's pretty possible since Twilight probably was around Celestia alot
<Sumica> oh I see seems I dot have the right name for it any more.
<Octavia> 13It was an aweful photoshop image.
*VioletVanilla comes to Luna's corner :3
<Octavia> 13I could tell that a mile away.
<MetalRainbowDash> It wasn't from photoshop.
<^Stargazer> and spike usually went where Twilight goes
<VioletVanilla> 6I am here for you. ^.^
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Also, that MLP season 2 opening: As sung by the US Marine Corps
<Octavia> 13It was photoshopped.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Exactly.
<MetalRainbowDash> It was from Paint.NET
<ValtheJean> 2,14 MS paint is just as bad :P
<Luna> 07rtmp://live.veemi.com/live?u=BronyStateWillNEVERSurrender&p=H8T8M0W
<Luna> 07BronyStateWillNEVERSurrender
<VioletVanilla> 6but why Val? What did I do? D:
<Octavia> 13Same thing.
<^Stargazer> how does one link to specific moments in youtube video's?
<MetalRainbowDash> I made a fake DVD cover to trick u ppl (Which failed epicly)
<herospirit> Applejack is in here, we will not tolerate dishonesty
<Sketchy_Sounds> So he probably already knew Blueblood was a colossal arse.
<Octavia> 13That term basically means anything altered in such a way.
<Xiagu> ^Stargazer, #t=XmYs or just X for seconds
<Rainbow_Dash> 11!!!
<LunaOnTheMoon> blueblood is not related to celestia
<ValtheJean> you were part of the betrayal :P
<herospirit> Lol, I love that comment
<herospirit> :p
<Rainbow_Dash> 11When did that Boombox get in here
<Octavia> 13Yeah, that trick didnt work out so well. :P
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/8376b98601fcfd0b5c1b3f4cb2c2bdce/55465%20-%20awesome%20fluttershy%20made_of_awesome.jpg
<Xiagu> ^Stargazer, at least that's how it worked last I checked
<Sketchy_Sounds> Or right click on the red bar and select "Copy video URL at specific time"
<DecapKing> http://miburl.com/CMViNE
<MetalRainbowDash> Lol but some people actually make it look real.
<Xiagu> ^ works too
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Your picture went bye-bye.
<VioletVanilla> 6I take art stealing/lies very seriously.
<Octavia> 13Especially considering some of us are artists and graphic designers. We can spot that stuff pretty easily. :P
<herospirit> Vanilla does not tolerate dishonesty; mental note.
<Luna> 07have some seaponies
<Luna> 07http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/168/b/c/my_little_seaponies_by_aleximusprime-d3j7fv2.png
<MetalRainbowDash> Hmm
<Wrek> 05octavai got a point
<Wrek> 05Octavia*
<MetalRainbowDash> Artists and Graphic Designers eh?
<Octavia> 13lol Herospirit
<Sumica> unable to plublish error.
<MetalRainbowDash> Can you make me a logo for my series?
<^Stargazer> that worked
<DecapKing> http://miburl.com/CMViNE
<Thunder_Dash> I agree with Octavia, though I'm not too great at art of any kind ^^'
<Luna> 07oh great...
<herospirit> I've spent enough time noticing all my own mistakes in my art. It becomes easier to notice it in others. :p
<Wrek> 05My little liars, paint is magic
<Octavia> 13Wrek would be the one to talk to about that. Not sure what he charges. :P
<VioletVanilla> 6I have had stuff outright stolen from me and then claimed as someone else's before. I will not tolerate that kind of thing.
<Octavia> 13lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'd also like to remind everyone that harmful trolling is against the rules :P
<Luna> 07welll
<MetalRainbowDash> I really need a logo for my series.
<Luna> 07looks like our stream is over
<DecapKing> http://miburl.com/CMViNE
<MetalRainbowDash> I tried making one in Photoshop. But idk if it is good
<ValtheJean> it was a good run at least :P
<MetalRainbowDash> I'll let you people see it.
<Luna> 07we have the same issues as we had during "Irene"
<Luna> 07unable to publish
<herospirit> Violet holds grudges; mental ote
<Octavia> 13Yeah.. now MetalRainbowDash is WAYYYYYYYYYY on my NO list for mod. lol
<Octavia> 13NO NO NO and a million times NO lol
<DecapKing> yeah
<ValtheJean> he's on my "let's toy around with him as long as possible" list :P
<DecapKing> she secretly plots to destroy me
<Octavia> 13lol :P
<Wrek> 05Ik now the feelign VioletVanilla.
<herospirit> mental note*
*Wrek hugs VioletVanilla
<VioletVanilla> 6I do not hold grudges herospirit. :| I have just had it happen before so I am wary of it and do not take it lightly.
<brony_v> lol @ DecapKing
<Darcemeus> I like the intro announcement on here.
<TrollightSparkle> These mental notes may come in handy.
<^Stargazer> ty
*VioletVanilla hugs Wrek back.
*Darcemeus sips some tea
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Lol
<GRRM> okay
<herospirit> Violet, you are Serious Business
<VioletVanilla> 6Glad you like it Darcemeus! ;3
<HaysforPonies> Dumb backspace.
<DecapKing> but she is plotting to destroy me in secret
<MirthTinker> hai hai
<Thunder_Dash> on the other hoof, /I/ hold grudges for a long time *hit*
<GRRM> so I came here because I'm interested in this pony thing that's going on in the internet right now
<Sumica> due to network error at server,steam name in use or not athorised.
<Razyn> 11ohai Mirthtinker, RS
<Luna> 07yep getting the same error
<VioletVanilla> 6I am serious business when it comes to stuff like lying and stealing.
<Leika> Dumb rock!
<Darcemeus> Hooooooh yeah it's awesome.
<ReticentSmolder> I demand that dari's topic be taken down >.>
<DecapKing> hey Mirth
<DecapKing> I see that you still have your wings
<Blums> Dumb sock!
<DecapKing> (as suggested by Silver)
<herospirit> I don't hold grudges. I prefer to release my anger in bursts of fury.
<GRRM> so... why ponies?
<Leika> Dumb lock!
<Octavia> 13People used to steal my art for icons and such CONSTANTLY a while back, but most didnt claim it as their own work, so I shrugged it off.
<MirthTinker> yeah, something went wrong with that sigil, I can't turn back!
<herospirit> Make a mental note of that.
<VioletVanilla> 6Poor Luna, I will sing seapony songs! n.n
<Leika> Because ponies are freakin' AWESOME!
<LunaOnTheMoon> because ponies
<VioletVanilla> 6SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO~
<brony_v> Oh. Speaking of grudges, I need to check up on something... *Fires up WoW*
<DecapKing> he said you should turn back in a week
<MetalRainbowDash> Ugh I cant find it
<Razyn> 11I may be able to help with that...
<MetalRainbowDash> Hold on
<herospirit> Octavia, I wish my shit was good enough that people wanted to steal it.
<Octavia> 13Should have said "used" instead of "steal" in that sense.
<Sumica> so in a way, i feel a bit better. But in another way I feel bad.
<MirthTinker> NO
<Rainbow_Dash> Link me to your art and ill print it out and hang it on my wall.
<Rainbow_Dash> XD
<MirthTinker> I mean, uh, thanks but I'm alright until he gets back
<DecapKing> VIOLETVANILLA WHY DO YOU WANT TO DESTROY ME?!?!?!?
<MirthTinker> also, is he coming on tonight?
<roushguy> Do you want the short answer or the psychological answer/
<Xiagu> because ponies
<Rainbow_Dash> Thats worse than someone using it for an icon, isnt it?
<Xiagu> ^ short answer
<VioletVanilla> 6I apologize if I went against the rules for kicking him, and I do not mean to be a jerk, but that kind of thing gets on my nerves. . . :|
<GRRM> psychological
<MetalRainbowDash> Hold on
<Razyn> 11Oh...kay.
<DecapKing> he left a while ago to go eat
<GRRM> I like psychological
<MetalRainbowDash> I have a facebook page that has the logo
<MetalRainbowDash> Hold on
<DecapKing> or something like that
<Octavia> 13lol Rainbow_Dash X3
<MirthTinker> so he'll be on later maybe? *puppy eyes*
<GRRM> my friend on this LGS forum I post on keeps linking me to pony videos
<herospirit> Rainbow_Dash, you don't want it. I suck.
<GRRM> so I'm curious
<herospirit> :0
<ValtheJean> >mfw it hasn't shown up on my client you kicked him O_o
<DecapKing> i wouldnt know, not in contact with him
<Xiagu> GRRM, have you watched any of the show yet?
<BeatleBrony> WATS UP EVERYPONY!
<Rainbow_Dash> I actually dont want anyones, I was kidding
<roushguy> MLP:FIM, combined with the internet, allows men to let out the sort of feelings generally kept inside and protects them via the anonymity of the internet
<VioletVanilla> 6I do not want to destroy you DecapKing. . . .-.
<roushguy> Plus
<roushguy> Ponies are adorably cute
<Rainbow_Dash> I have to many pictures I want to print out already..
<Octavia> 13I bet some people have have printed some of my nicer pieces to hang up or such, I dunno. :P
*VioletVanilla hugs DecapKing~
<GRRM> a little bit
<Wrek> 05its ok VioletVanilla
<DecapKing> LIES!!!
<Charlie_Horse> Pretty much.
<Razyn> 11Hey, I just found this... Thing.
<Blums> We like the show. The show is good
<DecapKing> YOU WANT TO DESTROY ZIM!
<GRRM> like the first half of the one with the dragon on the mountain
<BeatleBrony> Yes, the show is genuinely awesome
<GRRM> I'm doing this while writing a paper for uni
<Octavia> 13Impending Doom 3
<Octavia> 13!
<Razyn> 11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE-fZ5ETCPQ
<VioletVanilla> 6He came back, which is fine because he is not causing trouble anymore. . .
<DecapKing> is it a bow chicka wow wow thing?
<Wrek> 05octavia
<DecapKing> HOLY SHIT
<Wrek> 05stop ignoring me
<Razyn> 11It's... A thing.
<Wrek> 05*sadface*
<Howling_Griffon> YOU! OBEY THE FIST
<Razyn> 11Yeah.
<Gamerdude260> Ohai
<ReticentSmolder> seen it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 continue to ignore him Octavia...give into your anger. LET THE POWER OF THE DARK-SIDE CONTROL YOU
<GRRM> I like the songs
<VioletVanilla> 6Invader Zim Decap?
<BeatleBrony> Why do I, I straight 19 year old male, find these ponies so cuite!
<GRRM> but like I'm a grown man... I'm afraid to like it
<herospirit> I can activate fury mode.
<Blums> cute things are cute. you cant deny that
<Razyn> 11Well, what was your original reaction?
<Octavia> 13Aww, sorry Wrek. <3
<Darcemeus> 4I activate Rainboom Vanguard mode!
<Blums> there are 20 and 30 year olds watching it... 40s even
<DecapKing> FOR I AM ZIM!!
<BeatleBrony> True, but normally, cute doesn't attract 19 year old males
<herospirit> But my rage bar has a high maximum.
<MetalRainbowDash> Ok
<Darcemeus> 4Oh wait out of context?
<Howling_Griffon> well.. i cant draw full metal panic: the seccond friendship at 3am. (not well anyway) g'night fillies'ncolts
<MetalRainbowDash> Here is the logo I made
<Gamerdude260> Indeed.
<Darcemeus> 4Yep
<MetalRainbowDash> http://www.image-upload.net/viewer.php?file=pg9z2j7wpdzh50nb1zbg.jpg
<GRRM> I know
<GRRM> but it's like
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I activate DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANCOUGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<GRRM> I don't know
<BeatleBrony> IF this show was just cute, it wouldn't be as popular
<Gamerdude260> Ponies are sweaping the world. Just accept it.
<ReticentSmolder> that the people who can solve 4x4 rubix cubes will just have more stuff to do...its like an expansion pack :D
<TuxOtaku> GRRM, I'm 30, I'm a systems administrator, I drink scotch, I listen to jazz....and I like ponies.
<roushguy> I'm 21
<MetalRainbowDash> The link I put above is the logo
<DecapKing> sooooo
<roushguy> I'm not afraid to admit I'
<TuxOtaku> well...not JUST jazz
<roushguy> I'm fairly homophobic
*DecapKing pokes MirthTinker
*DecapKing pokes MirthTinker again
<NewDCDAlbark> 9>Dancougar
<NewDCDAlbark> 9Val
*DecapKing pokes MirthTinker again
<NewDCDAlbark> 9I am proud
<TuxOtaku> truthfully I listen to pretty much everything
<Xiagu> GRRM, you are in phase 1 or 2 or around there
<GRRM> well that's not good... being homophobic
<NewDCDAlbark> 9you have learned well.
<Xiagu> GRRM, give it a few days
<MetalRainbowDash> Octavia
<roushguy> And I still walk around whistling or humming the themesong or Winter Wrap Up
<Razyn> 11...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 sorry, forgot the R :P
<herospirit> MCafee tells me no. No image upload for me.
<MetalRainbowDash> Look at the link I sent above
<VioletVanilla> 6Natleyn!! ^.^
<TuxOtaku> roushguy, you and I are going to have issues then.
<GRRM> I liked the ARt of The dress thing
*DecapKing pokes MirthTinker yet again
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<MetalRainbowDash> Or below
<MetalRainbowDash> http://www.image-upload.net/viewer.php?file=pg9z2j7wpdzh50nb1zbg.jpg
<Hat> its intimidating
<roushguy> I don't go gaybashing or things
<Natleyn> Violet! :D
<NewDCDAlbark> 9eh, some people romanize it as Dancouga
<NewDCDAlbark> 9so no harm done
<Luna> 07a moment please
*Natleyn hugs VioletVanilla
*Silvermane plops on the ground and curls up into a ball
<Hat> hes angry
<Hat> hes german
<herospirit> Are we shouting things now?
<Hat> and hes a kid!
<BeatleBrony> I sing equestria girls along to california girls when it comes on the radio
<roushguy> It just makes me extremely uncomfortable whenever the topic is brought up
<Octavia> 13I saw it MRD, you can stop posting it. lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I've been browsing Super Robot Taisen vids because of you DCD :P
<herospirit> BUST- WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLF
<MetalRainbowDash> How is it?
<GRRM> oh
<Razyn> 11Oh my sounds serious
*Silvermane hugs Fluttershy, then curls up on the ground
<DecapKing> hey Silvermane
<roushguy> It's not restricted to male homosexuality either
<TuxOtaku> I don't so much like the music as I do the characters
<Silvermane> hey guys
*DecapKing pokes Silvermane
<roushguy> Female homosexuality is just as uncomfortable to me
*DecapKing pokes MirthTinker yet again
*VioletVanilla hugs Natleyn~ :3
<Octavia> 13Eh, it needs work still. It just takes a lot of trial and error and practice.
<VioletVanilla> 6How are you doing?
<Wrek> 05you still havent replied oct
<MetalRainbowDash> Well at least I tried -_-
<GRRM> I won't go into that topic on a pony board
<MirthTinker> HUBBY!
<Octavia> 13I will Wrek, sorry. XD
<DecapKing> Fluttershy is away at the momeny
<GRRM> but
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I just finished watching Dai-Gaurd take on a Heterodyne
<DecapKing> *moment
<GRRM> yeah
<Silvermane> hi tinkerbelle
<DecapKing> please leave a hug at the beep
<DecapKing> *beep*
<TuxOtaku> well, I'm from Toronto. I grew up around LGBT communities
<MirthTinker> I was feeding my dogs
<VioletVanilla> 6I like some of the text you used Metal, the effects of the shadow on it are cool~
<Silvermane> that's fine. i just wanted to hug something soft and fluffyish
<BeatleBrony> The show just has the perfect mix of everything
<TuxOtaku> hell my gf's sister is lesbian.
<Silvermane> that's nice
<MetalRainbowDash> Thanks
<BeatleBrony> The characters are really likable
<Razyn> 11In this chat: poking ponies.
<VioletVanilla> 6It is good for a first banner. Do not stop working at it!
<Gamerdude260> I want this freaking Ponyville MC Map
<BeatleBrony> the writing is excellent
<Hat> hey
<GRRM> I don't know man... I'M A GROWN MAN
<TuxOtaku> indeed.
*DecapKing pokes MirthTinker yet again
<GRRM> AND I LIKE PONIES
<Hat> anyone heard of nyan cat?
<DecapKing> indeed Razyn
<GRRM> AAAAAAH
<TuxOtaku> GRRM, and there's nothing wrong with that
<MirthTinker> also, its really hard to do things you're normally used to doing with magic, how do you pegasi and Earth ponies use your mouths for everything?
<GRRM> I don't know who to talk to about this
<MetalRainbowDash> ...
<BeatleBrony> PREACH IT GRRM!
<VioletVanilla> 6Of course Hat~ ;D
<MetalRainbowDash> Didn't I show u that like a few hours ago
<TuxOtaku> GRRM, us.
<Hat> ;)
<TuxOtaku> lol
<Silvermane> very carefully
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I have never heard of said poptart cat that expels rainbows while singing a looped song before
<TuxOtaku> we're like you
<SixSpeed> GRRM, there's only one thing to do...
<Hat> yes
<DecapKing> practice
<TuxOtaku> a brony
<Hat> i can't stop watching it
<VioletVanilla> 6The true questions is
*DecapKing pokes MirthTinker yet again
*Silvermane gasps for air for a moment
<Gamerdude260> Well
<Natleyn> :3
<MetalRainbowDash> ValtheJean yes you do know.
<SixSpeed> ...more pony.
<BeatleBrony> This reminds me of that scene from spongebob
<MirthTinker> what DecapKing?
<Blums> throw a party?
<Awesomeshy> alright well
*Razyn 11has quite a bit of respect for woodworking non-unicorns
<Hat> i've been nyan'd for 70 minutes
<GRRM> I don't know if I like that term
<Filter> ^
<MetalRainbowDash> :o
<GRRM> bro kind of reminds me of frat boys
<BeatleBrony> "I'M A BRONY AND I'M PROUD!!"
<Awesomeshy> they're adding us on mibbit
<Gamerdude260> I belive Lauren said that the show was made for both genders. Right?
<DecapKing> nothing, just waiting for some type of reaction
<Natleyn> Nice.
<herospirit> ZA WARUDO!

*DecapKing pokes MirthTinker yet again
<GRRM> and brony just seems like it's a weird word
<herospirit> TOKI WO TOMARE!
<MirthTinker> 13...
<MetalRainbowDash> 1 Hour and 10 mins.
*Natleyn hugs herospirit
<HaysforPonies> She intended it to be for family instead of just little girls.
<Silvermane> they make hoof caps that hold equipment. Like Octavia has one for her bow
*Hat shakes off froth on mouth
<TrollightSparkle> Epic sax guy for 10 hours..
<BeatleBrony> Lauren said that the show was made for little girls, and their parents
<SixSpeed> GRRM, it is a weird word.
<Filter> bro + pony
<Xiagu> GRRM, just give it time
<Sumica> Take all the time you need.
<Filter> nothin weird about it
<herospirit> MUDA DA! MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA!!!
<Gamerdude260> Fuuu- Right.
<MetalRainbowDash> Hat
<TrollightSparkle> Only made it through one hour :P
<Razyn> 11 9_9
<MirthTinker> 13SIC EM!
<herospirit> Soshite, toki ga ugoki desu.
<MetalRainbowDash> Go to 1227.com
*DecapKing pokes MrPeddington
<Gamerdude260> But hey. Nothing worng with being a brony.
<MrPeddington> 10GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOW!
<GRRM> George RR Martin is a weird word
<DecapKing> awww
*Silvermane curls up tighter, now cowering
<Gamerdude260> Just all I'm sayin'
<MetalRainbowDash> Your browser dances to Epic Sax guy
<BeatleBrony> lol
<Filter> lol
<Natleyn> Hero, that combo is silly
<Hat> should i take the precaution of turning the volume to maX?
<MetalRainbowDash> SAXR0LL3D
<TuxOtaku> hehe, I'm working on possibly my most ambitious pony fan-art piece since I started watching the show
<Natleyn> It's not even damage efficient
<MetalRainbowDash> Yes
<BeatleBrony> Do tell!
<herospirit> Iknowright Natleyn
<Viola> 6Random disconnect on me?
<DecapKing> its like the bears i used to wrestle when i was about the size of Silvermane
<MirthTinker> 13oh noes!
<TuxOtaku> it's a PMV set to Royksopp's "Happy Up Here"
<Natleyn> Looks nice, though.
<DecapKing> sooooo long ago
<MetalRainbowDash> Hey Violet.
<Razyn> 11Oh MrPeddington. You're as... Charming as ever.
<herospirit> But the awesome factor makes it better.
<Sumica> reset by peer
<Hat> im getting saxrolld
<BeatleBrony> scootaloointeresting.jpg
<Natleyn> I prefer to play Chaca, 'cause its actually hard
<Viola> 6Hallo~
<MirthTinker> 13I forgot, Peddington takes commands from my magic, without it feeding his senses he's operating on his own!
<Viola> 6Hmmm. . . Odd.
<TuxOtaku> but it's not really using much footage from the show
<Silvermane> oh dear
<DecapKing> ive got it
<MetalRainbowDash> VioletVanilla
<MetalRainbowDash> or umm
*MrPeddington 10flails wildly
<Razyn> 11:\
<Mothera> testing
<MetalRainbowDash> whatever your name is
<Mothera> cool
<MrPeddington> 10GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOW!
<TuxOtaku> I'm attempting to animate as much of it originally as possible
<MetalRainbowDash> Ummm
*DecapKing charges MrPeddington to the ground
*Silvermane rolls over, looking away
<richfiles> I had to work during the load test. How did things go?
<GRRM> oh man
<Natleyn> And 'cause if I get timing right on countering, every human player I fight against gets angry when I block everything :3
<GRRM> why do I feel so weird about htis
<Viola> 6How are you doing Sumica? ^^ Good job on your stream!!
<DecapKing> heh
<TuxOtaku> which is a bloody feat...because I can't draw and I suck with flash
<Gamerdude260> Soooo. Being the only brony in my school sucks.
<DecapKing> this takes me back to the old country
<MetalRainbowDash> OK when will the streaming come back?
<Hat> lol this sax guy is epic
<herospirit> ...Now I wanna play fighting games.
<TuxOtaku> GRRM, I felt the same way
*Silvermane groans slightly
<Viola> And suddenly I am Viola. . .
<ReticentSmolder> (yfw yes, I AM that dedicated to established background and not retconning material...usually)
<roushguy> You want to hear cute overload?
<TuxOtaku> gets better when you tell someone that you know won't judge you
<roushguy> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLQW_DKQQ8g
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Foozogz - This Song Made Man A Fluttershy
<Octavia> 13lol I noticed that. :P
<Natleyn> I'd play Jojo's, but I've only met one guy who had it and a dreamcast.
<Natleyn> And story mode isn't much fun.
<^Stargazer> hey Balloons
<SixSpeed> The real question is why care what other people say?
<herospirit> New "Fighting is Magic" theory:
<Xiagu> ^
<TuxOtaku> Gamerdude260, school is a very weird environment
<Balloons> Hello
<Xiagu> Also I love that song
<SixSpeed> There should be quotes in there some where.
<DecapKing> so what do i do with him now?
<VioletVanilla> 6Natleyn~ ;3
<herospirit> Flutterstare = Fluttershy's Za Warudo
<Gamerdude260> School is werid.
<BeatleBrony> I met a brony at my colleg
<BeatleBrony> college*
<VioletVanilla> 6How are you doing?
<Razyn> 11(What's that part where the pendulum is held called?)
<Gamerdude260> Luckkky.
<DecapKing> cause back in the old country we would kill them
<BeatleBrony> She was actually a girl
<GRRM> oh whoa
<Filter> lol
<GRRM> I know one of you guys
<SixSpeed> Lots of casual bronies at my college.
<^Stargazer> why care what other people enjoy? It's none of your business now is it? lol
<DecapKing> and i doubt you would want that to happen
<Natleyn> Moi? o-o;
<herospirit> I haven't even gotten to play Jojo's :[
<Ghosties> 4Sath, did you upload MetalRainbowDash's app on the forum?
<BeatleBrony> We are naturally social people
<GRRM> hey Westy543
<TuxOtaku> SixSpeed, I believe much the same...however far too few people share our enlightened views
<Brevity> pfft I have little doubt I'm the only brony at my university, but that doesnt affect my enjoyment
<BeatleBrony> People want to spread what they think is awesome
<Westy543> sup GRRM
<MirthTinker> 13well, he's just acting up a bit because he's upset, but he'll calm down. After that he just acts like a normal obedient bear
<MetalRainbowDash> I want
<MetalRainbowDash> Streaming
<MetalRainbowDash> To
<MetalRainbowDash> Come
<MetalRainbowDash> back!
<VioletVanilla> 6Yes you silly filly! ;D
<MetalRainbowDash> PONIES!
<SixSpeed> ...so? Don't bring it up.
<GRRM> how's red alert mod coming?
<MetalRainbowDash> VIoletVanilla
<ValtheJean> ung...can't even play a youtube vid without buffering...god I hope they fix this problem soon
<MrPeddington> 10GRAOW!!!! graow.....gr...oaw?
<VioletVanilla> 6Yes dear child?
<herospirit> Silvermane doesn't need consent
<Natleyn> I'm a bit tired, but I'm in a good mood. Thanks :3
*^Stargazer ears perk up
<DecapKing> what happens if i give him vodka?
<Boombox> ...? ...*
<MetalRainbowDash> Can you helps me on my logo
<GRRM> okay, I think my favorite pony is Pinkie Pie
<^Stargazer> red alert mod? as in C&C Red Alert?
<Westy543> Alright
<Natleyn> And how's Violet doing today?
<Gamerdude260> Butttt. I am going to blast Winter Wrap Up at the end of winter at the end of winter this year
<MirthTinker> 13...he has no stomach Decap
<ValtheJean> rofl...he's asking for help on his logo now?
<TuxOtaku> Pinkie Pie is awesome
<MetalRainbowDash> :'(
<Westy543> Yes ^Stargazer
<Razyn> 11Good idea.
<Sumica> seemed ok till masive lag lots of complaing about lag then seems cant publish to site any more.
<Silvermane> consent is for those who are afraid to apologize and deliver flowers
<Octavia> 13Yeah, he was.
<Westy543> As in Red Alert: A Path Beyond
<Silvermane> also
<^Stargazer> which one, 1, 2 or 3?
<Leika> I love Rarity and Fluttersy myself
<TuxOtaku> but you can't doubt the cute overload that is Fluttershy
<MirthTinker> 13he's a /clockwork/ teddy bear
<Leika> Fluttershy*
<Razyn> 11Can I Mirth? Just once?
<Westy543> It's an indie shooter that seeks to recreate Red Alert 1 as an FPS.
<ValtheJean> it's probably just a server issue
*Silvermane groans and rolls over on the ground
<BeatleBrony> Fluttershy
*Octavia 13is gonna shoot down his app faster than RD can sonic rainboom
<MirthTinker> 13do what?
<ValtheJean> which means not your fault :P
<BeatleBrony> You cannot fight the D'awwwww
<GRRM> Fluttershy is okay
<SixSpeed> I've got Derpy on my login screen on my laptop. It shows up all the time at school. Nobody says anything, so I don't bring it up.
<HaysforPonies> Fluttershy is my favorite. Though she's kind of set there in stone. The others fight for second. Right now second is Rainbow Dash.
<MetalRainbowDash> Ugh and the BronyState ppl haven't responded to my thing asking for the application
<VioletVanilla> 6I am achey and tired as well. It is 3:58AM here and I am thinking of going to bed soon. . .
<GRRM> but I like Pinkie Pie
<herospirit> O-o
<ValtheJean> 10 seconds flat
<TuxOtaku> Fluttershy is like every cute nerd girl I ever had a crush on in high school
<LunaOnTheMoon> Luna is best pony
<GRRM> she's funny
<DecapKing> wait, this is a teddy bear?
<Octavia> 13Even faster. :P
<herospirit> That wouldn't worry me if it was anyone else
<LunaOnTheMoon> Twilight is best mane 6
<GRRM> who is Luna?
<Leika> !link Fluttershy
<ShadTheCrazed> We need to ponyify this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bkY9ZS-9BA&feature=related
<Westy543> (Also free!) http://westy.cncfps.com/Pics/APB/rockets.jpg
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/32784
<DecapKing> why are you afraid of a simple teddy bear?
<VioletVanilla> 6What kind of help on the logo do you need?
<Silvermane> the streamers are off line
<LunaOnTheMoon> but all ponies have a place in my heart
<MetalRainbowDash> Like effects
<GRRM> is she a character that's introduced later?
<MetalRainbowDash> and stuff
<^Stargazer> I always liked the cute ones, Fluttershy and Luna have been tied for first for a while now
<Ghosties> 4Where is MRD's app?????
<Gamerdude260> I kinda switch. First was fluttershy, then rarity. Then pinkie Pie. Now Im iffy between RD and Pinkie
<Efreet> Twilight lifts up Rarity to try and find Philomena.. wat
<Silvermane> yeah? why's that
<TuxOtaku> GRRM, Nightmare Moon after she turns back into a normal pony.
<GRRM> oh
<VioletVanilla> 6KILL IT
<Octavia> 13Hopefully lost in time and space.
<GRRM> that must be an earlier episode
<SixSpeed> SPOILER OH GOD
<Hat> MetalRainbowDash: what application do you speak of
<MirthTinker> 13he's 7 feet tall, and equipped with scythe-like claws and rotating lazer array in his mouth
<^Stargazer> I think I like Fluttershy because she reminds me of a close friend from high school ( well, almost... My friend wasn't really skiddish lol )
<TuxOtaku> lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 please be patient MetalRainbowDash, we respond to every application
<Ghosties> 4-_-
<Natleyn> ;~;
<VioletVanilla> 6DEAR SWEET CELESTIA BURN IT WITH THE SUN!
<GRRM> I'm watching Dragonshie
<Sumica> yes but not sure if it was me causeing the lag or not.
<Xiagu> GRRM, yes, it's from the pilot
<Leika> "Put me down!"
<VioletVanilla> 6DDDD<
<ShadTheCrazed> I need to take Bayonetta's theme, and make it more Twilight Sparkle.
<GRRM> er Dragonshy
<ValtheJean> lol, he hasn't sent in an app
<Sumica> I should hope not seeing as we had 200 for the hub ep
*Silvermane is terrified of giant clockwork abominations that come out of his filly friends closet. He'd say this if he wasn't clutching his guy on the ground
<Synros> give it time..
<ValtheJean> just the request for oen
<MirthTinker> 13with parts of his body exposed to show clockwork and armor
<ValtheJean> one*
<MetalRainbowDash> Hat it is one for umm
<Xiagu> GRRM, she gets two lines in the whole season :C but fans have made a bunch of fanon about her
<MetalRainbowDash> possibly becoming mod
<Natleyn> It's only around 10pm here
<Sumica> I just dont like leaving problems un fixed =p
<GRRM> oh
<TuxOtaku> Pinkie Pie reminds me entirely of my girlfriend
<Octavia> 13Maybe we'll get lucky and he'll forget. lol
<GRRM> yeah I looked her up
<VioletVanilla> 6Synros! O: You have been here too?!?!?
<TuxOtaku> she's just as random
<SixSpeed> Silly, none of you spelled Rainbow Dash right.
<MetalRainbowDash> Ok everyone who has fb
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Cereal Velocity: Story: Pinkie P.Ie. (http://tinyurl.com/3f9rv7f)
<ValtheJean> and he's now complaining on chat that we haven't immediately responded to it
<herospirit> Maybe I'll apply someday when I've been here longer.
<Silvermane> his gut*
<Synros> yah
<Leika> People like stories of rendemption
<DecapKing> if you think that scary, you wouldnt want to see me and my old comrades with vodka and some guns
*VioletVanilla giggles at Natleyn~
<Srake> pleh
<MetalRainbowDash> Who has FB
<herospirit> I feel I do not yet deserve Mod powers.
<MetalRainbowDash> Facebook
<DecapKing> ah the good times.....
<VioletVanilla> 6I am sorry you are tired D;
<ValtheJean> really, he's doing a GREAT job of impressing us :P
<herospirit> ...............................
<MetalRainbowDash> Who has Facebook
<MetalRainbowDash> If u do
<TuxOtaku> Leika, yeah...I always loved the X-Men stories when Magneto joined the X-Men
<Gamerdude260> UUUgh,
<MetalRainbowDash> Go to this chat
<herospirit> No reason...
<GRRM> heh, there's a pony wiki
<Hat> MetalRainbowDash: ok well i won't discuss it for risk of jynxing it
<Octavia> 13Seriously, he was a trouble maker for a while at first. Then he bitched. Then he lied to the chat. Then he bitched more. No no no no.
<TuxOtaku> GRRM, yup
<Gamerdude260> Notch. Y U NO PUT MOD SUPPORT?
*Sumica finishes kicking his computers ass.
<HaysforPonies> The hell. 13 authors for this one.
<TuxOtaku> there's pony communities all over
<VioletVanilla> 6and Synros it is good to see you! ^^; Sorry I have not. . .
<Razyn> 11He has a body built around a grandfather clock, right? Because my memory is notorious for being... Wrong.
<Silvermane> uh huh. *groan*
<Sumica> So what did i miss.
<Ghosties> 4Is it that MRD has become everyone's troll or something?
<SixSpeed> Yurp
<RainbowDashCancel> GRRM, if you're willing to watch the show for 7 episodes, it gets better as the show goes on
<TuxOtaku> Gamerdude260, just wait for 1.8
<GRRM> I've sseen some fanart too
<Brevity> GRRM there are fanfic wikis
<RainbowDashCancel> much better
<DecapKing> also i dont think he is 7 feet tall
<ValtheJean> I think he's going to be BMN's equivalent to George Bush
<Octavia> 13He was a troll for a while when we were initially stress testing, I remember that.
<Ghosties> 4Can someone tell me what is so wrong with MRD? Like, what exactly did he do
<Gamerdude260> Meh
<GRRM> pony fanfic wikis?
<MirthTinker> 13you're indeed wrong
<Synros> lol good to see you too VioletVanilla
<Ghosties> 4I do remember him spamming
<MetalRainbowDash> http://apps.facebook.com/neatchat/chatroom?pid=125354227555734
<ValtheJean> George Bush the regular from ponychan that is
<GRRM> or just fanfic wikis?
<herospirit> Alright, getting the question out of the way. Are you dying or aroused?
<MetalRainbowDash> Go there if you have FB
<Ghosties> 4But otherwise...?
<Brevity> namely Fallout: Equestria
<SixSpeed> Fanfics terrify me.
<Natleyn> I get up at 6am for school, so it's a bit of a long day for me. :<
<Gamerdude260> But for now. Mods are a pain to install.
<RainbowDashCancel> there's an official mlp wiki
<RainbowDashCancel> mlp.wikia.com
<RainbowDashCancel> but be careful
<Octavia> 13Then he lied about being Lauren Fausts friend and was bitching on and on about no one believing him until he finally came clean.
<MPR|> official?
<RainbowDashCancel> spoilers warning
<GRRM> I'm too lazy to read fanfics
<MirthTinker> 13he's made like a clockwork soldier underneath, with a bit of magic-infused gem circuits for behavior and energy
<GRRM> tbh
<Synros> or talk to you*
<ValtheJean> spamming, color avoidance, linking during streams
<Gamerdude260> Well. When you're instaling a ton
<ValtheJean> annoying me
<RainbowDashCancel> yeah,
<SixSpeed> HAh
<MetalRainbowDash> Hmm..
<RainbowDashCancel> the one with most of the info about the show
<ValtheJean> constantly resending a poorly photoshopped image
<MetalRainbowDash> Anybody have Facebook?
<Octavia> 13Yeah, think he was annoying Sumica too or something. Cant remember.
<VioletVanilla> 6 1. He spammed. 2. He claimed to know Lauren Faust and proceeded to try to lie to us. 3. Him with mod powers would be giving a five year olf a license to drive in New York City.
<Brevity> you havent finished watching the shows. you will be unlazy re: fanfics (I too was once skeptical)
<ValtheJean> annoying me
<SixSpeed> I'll stick to fanart. It's hilarious and easily forgotten if horrifying.
<ValtheJean> openly complaining about mods
<DecapKing> uh, where is his power supply?
<ValtheJean> annoying me
<Silvermane> neither
<ValtheJean> annoying me
<Hat> no
<GRRM> don't be so sure about that
<ValtheJean> and did I mention annoying me?
<Ghosties> 4Okay, okay
<Razyn> 11A good question indeed
<Octavia> 13He is a definite no from me already.Bet hes 14 or so.
<Hat> nobody uses facebook anymore
<GRRM> I've not seen many horrible pony fanarts yet, but by god are there some terrible ones of things I like
<LightningFaith> I do :/
<Hat> Hatpages are all the rage now
<Ghosties> 4Can one of you please direct me to his app
<VioletVanilla> 6DID I MENTION NEW YORK CITY?!?!? D8
<herospirit> that's shocking. I had assumed you were always aroused.
<MirthTinker> 13its in a spell matrix of rubies within the core of his abdomen
<Silvermane> no. i just make fillies around me aroused.
<Octavia> 13I dont think he even sent in an app just yet.
<Ghosties> 4It's not on the forum and I don't see it in the email
<ValtheJean> I don't have access to the bronystate email :P
<DecapKing> well
<SixSpeed> Yes.
<MetalRainbowDash> Go here
<MetalRainbowDash> http://apps.facebook.com/neatchat/chatroom?pid=125354227555734
*VioletVanilla has only been there once in her life and remembers the cars.
<Silvermane> then they spend the effort to try and do the same for me
<ValtheJean> lol, if it's not in the email then he lied about submitting a request
<DecapKing> lets put this little toy to the test then
<MetalRainbowDash> If u have FB
<Razyn> 11A better is who sanctioned this... Creation of yours. He violates quite a few important laws...
<Ghosties> 4Thennnnnnnn why the hell are you guys talking about his app like it's bad?
<ValtheJean> because he's been bitching that we never got back to him
*Silvermane rolls over again
<GRRM> uh... what's shipping?
<Octavia> 13Ghosties. You missed a lot of the shit he pulled in chat.
<GRRM> (this probably sounds stupid)
*MrPeddington 10is sitting on the ground, inspecting a flower beningly
<Brevity> you know, I never found out myself
<herospirit> ...Totally.
<Octavia> 13We're talking about the stuff he's already done.
<HaysforPonies> Putting two characters together in a relationship
<Brevity> but i've learned to correlate it with ^
<SixSpeed> Yeah.
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<MetalRainbowDash> Well I want my own chat room
<Octavia> 13How hes acted.
<VioletVanilla> 6;A;
<Ghosties> 4So he wants to become a mod...
<DecapKing> never mind
<GRRM> in like fiction in general?
<MetalRainbowDash> with admin controls
<Octavia> 13It was pretty bad.
<herospirit> That's it. :/
<Ghosties> 4Or he just wants to troll by saying he applied
<MetalRainbowDash> I cant find a place that has that
<VioletVanilla> 6eeyup~
<Gamerdude260> I reaaly hate the new enderman mob
<SixSpeed> Or pictures.
<Octavia> 13Yeah...
<HaysforPonies> Yes.
<GRRM> oh
<TuxOtaku> GRRM, my advice...stay away from the fanfics for now
<MrPeddington> 10............
<ValtheJean> also, we're not talking about his app per se, we're saying that WHEN he applies we will shoot him down so hard
<VioletVanilla> 6Both probably
<Ghosties> 4Sounds like a swell guy
<MrPeddington> 10...graow
<ValtheJean> eeyuyp
<TuxOtaku> they're weird
<GRRM> like I said I'm too lazy to read fanfics
<VioletVanilla> 6Would not be surprised if he starts claiming he IS one. @.@
<SixSpeed> Good.
<TuxOtaku> and will ruin the spirit of the show for you
<ValtheJean> lol
<SixSpeed> Keep it that way.
<ValtheJean> I will happily proove him wrong :P
<GRRM> k
<Octavia> 13I gave him the address unfortunately. Because I'm nice... sorry about that. That was before the lies some more and such though. lol
<DecapKing> yes, i know how you feel comrade bear
<BeatleBrony> Well, why not fanfic?
<Razyn> 11It's too bad there isn't a cavity of some sort. I would have /loved/ to see a Boombox+MrPeddington combo... Mech... Thingy.
<Gamerdude260> *coughCUPCAKEScough*
<ValtheJean> there's nothing wrong with giving the email address
<TuxOtaku> NO!
<ValtheJean> especially considering everyone could see it
<Ghosties> 4You gave him the email address?
<TuxOtaku> !moon Gamerdude260
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, TuxOtaku!
<Razyn> 11You know.
<BeatleBrony> I stay away from cupcakes like it's the plauge
<ValtheJean> for applications, yes
<Razyn> 11For science
<Ghosties> 4Well, yeah, nothing wrong with that
<MirthTinker> 13oh, that's in his belly silly
<Octavia> 13Yeah, to request an app.
<Brevity> still havent read that one. apparently it was a big deal
<Razyn> 11!!!
<Octavia> 13To him though, ugh. lol
<TuxOtaku> derp
<ValtheJean> lol
<Gamerdude260> *coughSWEETAPPLEMASSACREcough*
<SixSpeed> Lol
<Ghosties> 4Damn, you're a big daddy aren't you MRD?
<GRRM> oh welp
<ValtheJean> as mods, we must act impartially :P
<TuxOtaku> Gamerdude260, stop that now.
<HaysforPonies> Oh now you're just being silly.
<Gamerdude260> Don't read those fanfics.
<SixSpeed> MOOOOOONNAAAAAA
<Bash> 5am
<Octavia> 13I think hes just really young or such. Preteen drama and the like.
<Bash> as good a time as any to watch ponies
*Razyn 11turns to face the giant machine.
<ValtheJean> as such, we treat every application fairly :P
<GRRM> I see why you guys wanted me to stay away from fanfics
<GRRM> heh
<Gamerdude260> There are terrible.
<DecapKing> well anyways
<Silvermane> eeyup *thump*
*DecapKing pokes MirthTinker yet again
<ValtheJean> just because he has no chance in hell of being recruited doesn't mean we have to hide the information from him
<Octavia> 13Unless they act how he has acted. lol
<MirthTinker> 13wat?
<TuxOtaku> oh and Gamerdude260 is 1.8 out already??? you mentioned enderman
*Silvermane lolls his tongue as his head bounces off the dirt
<HaysforPonies> Fanfics like anything run a strict Sturgeon's law. 90+% of it is crap.
<GRRM> well don't worry
<Gamerdude260> No.. I just found out baout enderman.
<Orangestar> !moon
<Gamerdude260> *about
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Orangestar!
<DecapKing> im just bored
<herospirit> No Ponies here right now Bash
*Orangestar grabs
<GRRM> I've seen worse
<Xiagu> >``Here, let me say the names of two horrible fanfics and tell you not to read them, definitely not planting the seed of some burning curiosity within you to find out what they are''
<herospirit> :[
<ValtheJean> "<MetalRainbowDash> Well I want my own chat room
<ValtheJean> <MetalRainbowDash> with admin controls
<ValtheJean> <MetalRainbowDash> I cant find a place that has that"
<MetalRainbowDash> How do I make my own Mibbit chat room?
<DecapKing> and out of vodka
<herospirit> We can talk about ponies if you like. :D
<SixSpeed> Endermen are going to be fantastic.
*Silvermane whimpers
*VioletVanilla lolz at Ghosties comment about him being a "BIG DADDY"
<ValtheJean> this guy just makes me lol more and more
<GRRM> but I had to lol
<Gamerdude260> But.
<Sumica> So has MRD been going on like this the whole time/
<Gamerdude260> They appear randomly and kill you when you turn around.
<Razyn> 11Prepare yourself, Peddington!
<Sumica> ?
<Gamerdude260> Atleast
<Xiagu> there are plenty of good fics
<SixSpeed> Uh
<ValtheJean> eeyup
<herospirit> What is even happening to this Pony.
<Gamerdude260> That;s what I've heard
<SixSpeed> Well sorta.
*MrPeddington 10rolls on his stomach
<SixSpeed> They only attack you if you look directly at them.
<TuxOtaku> speaking of fanfics though....anyone here a fan of Ghost Rider (and not the crappy movie version with Nic Cage)
<MrPeddington> 10garu?
<Octavia> 13lol Yeah.
<DecapKing> should i be worried about Silvermane at all?
<GRRM> it's okay
<GRRM> not the worst thing I've ever seen
<GRRM> or read
<SixSpeed> And if you wear a pumpkin on your head, your gaze does not affect them.
<MetalRainbowDash> Wait
<MetalRainbowDash> Come to this link
<MetalRainbowDash> http://cbe002.chat.mibbit.com/
<MirthTinker> 13meh, probably
<Brevity> Ghost Writer was a toy in the early 90's right
<Sumica> Might just be me but he comes off as wayyyyy to overbearing.
<MirthTinker> 13he might be going into shock about now
<Bash> well i was gonna watch on youtube anyway, just a random thought cause i'm here through regular ol' mirc
<MetalRainbowDash> This is my own Pony Chat room
<TuxOtaku> no no
<DecapKing> should i try to kick him in the ribs?
<TuxOtaku> the marvel comics character
<Octavia> 13I honestly think hes 12-14. He acts typical of a kid of that age range.
<GRRM> well
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no more links please
<Silvermane> this pony is in extreme gastrointestinal discomfort
<BeatleBrony> So, anypony listen to my music?
<Xiagu> *marevel
*Razyn 11grabs Boombox and opens MrPeddington. "Maybe it's the scientist in me..." Razyn jams Boombox into MrPeddington and closes up the bear.
*HaysforPonies is now thinking of the Nic Cage Song.
<NewDCDAlbark> 9also
<Ghosties> 4That's my name for him now
<SixSpeed> Is it like the Beatles?
<Octavia> 13But I could be wrong. Heaven knows I've met some adults that act like that as well.
<Ghosties> 4Big Daddy
<BeatleBrony> Lookin for some feedback
<NewDCDAlbark> 9the Latin American Pony toys arrived here
<BeatleBrony> yup
<Octavia> 13lol Ghosties
<NewDCDAlbark> 9the MCD ones i mean
<Ghosties> 4Holy shit, Big Daddy
<SixSpeed> Then nope.
<NewDCDAlbark> 9gonna go pick one up tomorrow
<BeatleBrony> Beatles Covers with pony lyrics
<interior_gummy> the glow in the dark ones?
<Ghosties> 4You made your own Mibbit Pony chat room
<Natleyn> Nice.
<MetalRainbowDash> Everyone
*Silvermane tries scooting away from DecapKing, using one hoof whist the other clutches his gut
<NewDCDAlbark> 9yeah those
<Natleyn> Ladies.
*Razyn 11turned to his friends with a wicked grin. "I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE SOME REAL SHIT."
*RainbowDashCancel pictures Ghost Rider sitting down on a desk, writing a novel
<MirthTinker> 13we probably shouldn't mention there's no way to stop Peddington now that he's disconnected from me, since before the only way to stop his auto-repair spell was for me to tell him so or be incapacitated
<MetalRainbowDash> Go to the link above
<NewDCDAlbark> 9is there a link to images on them?
<MetalRainbowDash> The cbe mibbit chat
<Pontang> Oh hi not-mibbit user. :D
<Awesomeshy> so I just connect with the mibbit client right
<GRRM> I listen to music
<Ghosties> 4But Big Daddy, I'm a mod here D:
<NewDCDAlbark> 9the ad here said they were 4 toys
<GRRM> oh
<SixSpeed> I have ears.
<Ghosties> 4I can't just jump ship like that
<NewDCDAlbark> 9and the ad had RD, AJ and Pinkie
<interior_gummy> not like america, where fluttershy doesn't even get her own model
<MrPeddington> 10...*garu*?
<Pontang> u_u
<SixSpeed> Two of them, in fact.
<NewDCDAlbark> 9and I'm hoping the 4th is Twilight
<herospirit> Erm. Can I help?
<DecapKing> oh wait
<Brevity> thats one thing I have held on to thus far, not getting into "pony related" music (remixes of the season one songs are still OK though)
<Pontang> Aye
<DecapKing> i know that look
<Boombox> FOREIGN HOST DETECTED
<NewDCDAlbark> 9I'd only get Twilight due to the fact that getting ponies for me is MD
<MrPeddington> 10(FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSION HA!)
<MibbitUser> A WILD MIBBITUSER APPEARS
<DecapKing> Silvermane just ate some bad food
<MetalRainbowDash> :( so nobody is gonna come

<Octavia> 13"Y u no gib Dimmie moneh?"
<GRRM> I like Rainbow Dash too

<ReticentSmolder> no catchy re-name for Boom-Peddington?
*Razyn 11laughs to the heavens, haven completely abandoned his usual taciturn mask
<Silvermane> boomington. now shush
<SixSpeed> Agreed, Brevity.
<ValtheJean> meh, he's just doing it for attention

<Sumica> Dont make Val put you up on a pike as a warning to others
*Silvermane groans
<SixSpeed> I appreciate all the work Eurobeat Brony does, but I can't get myself into that style of electronic music.
<IAmNotAGoat> Pony music is super fab, just realized that today lol
<Octavia> 13Yeah, definite no from me. I cant even hold all this no.

<Octavia> 13For the lawlz of course.
<herospirit> Val does.
<Sumica> Pike sound more deadly.
<GRRM> oh I heard some of NotACleverPony's stuff actually
<BeatleBrony> the AlexS dubstep remixes are awesome
<IAmNotAGoat> So much agreement, RainbowDashWins XD
<Silvermane> it hit my entire abdomen at points
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but tridents are more my style :P
<SixSpeed> I'm wondering if anyone will recognize my Rainbow Dash vinylon the back of my car.
<Stomper> is that you?
<Xiagu> NotACleverPony is great too

<ValtheJean> lol, only for you ghosties <3

<MibbitUser> we are all me
<Octavia> 13lol
<Ghosties> 4<3
<IAmNotAGoat> Silva hound is still my favorite though, his track for Vinyl is mindblowing
<Sumica> I guess a trident could be more effecent. 3 to 1
<Stomper> :( i dont like this any more...
<MibbitUser3> you silly plebian
<Xiagu> AlexS's CMC remix made me realize that I don't hate all dubstep (dubtrot :3 )
<MirthTinker> 13Razyn, are you sure you should be messing with a semi-autonomous automata capable of rational thought and housing a body of steel, aluminum, and diamond?
<Razyn> 11...
<Brevity> not gonna lie, I dream about getting a blue tacoma with rainbowdash stickers behind and above the rear wheels
<DecapKing> 4should i got my chainsaw that runs on magic?
<herospirit> *thinks of most crass terms he can for medical pains*
<herospirit> *got one*
<Stomper> dont call me a plebian!
<herospirit> Have you got the shits?
<MetalRainbowDash> Deadchat kinda
<Pontang> The frogs are taking over.
<Natleyn> Val, question

<Valthe> 2,14 yessums?
<Sumica> Oh look worldsdumbist is on. Shame server is derping.
<DecapKing> 4*get
<Natleyn> Is it Val the Jean, or Valthe Jean?
<Razyn> 11Mare, I'm having fun! I knew there was a scientist in me, but he's never had a chance to play!
<SixSpeed> Hah.
*Sumica glares at server.
<Plorf> i used to hate dubstep
<Plorf> now i don't
<BeatleBrony> the CMC remix also shows how awesome that song can be
<Valthe> 2,14 I'm not sure what you mean...it's just Valthejean
<Pontang> NOOOOOOO
<Plorf> ^
<BeatleBrony> Did you hear that there apparently is a good version of that song
<BeatleBrony> ?
*MirthTinker 13kisses Silvermane on the cheek, rubbing his stomach
<SixSpeed> Dubstep is crazy overdone and diluted now that the songs all sound the same.
<BeatleBrony> Daniel Ingram still has it
<RainbowDashWins> I want a Rainbow Dash mini. There's a picture that surfaced a long time ago, probably on here, someone had skinned one in Forza 3. It was epic.
*DecapKing 4pokes MirthTinker yet again
<Natleyn> I was wondering if/how you split up the name.
<Brevity> a non-tonedeaf-scootaloo version?
<BeatleBrony> yes!
<Pontang> prince-dari: it should work now.
<Brevity> want
<Razyn> 11Now arise! Beast of fortune! The thirteenth Zodiac! The new world order!
<Stomper> says no place named bronychat :/

<BeatleBrony> facehoof
<Pontang> It's private I assume.
<Pontang> :o
<BeatleBrony> no Gamerdude
<DecapKing> 4should i do anything about Razyn trying to do something to take over the world?
<BeatleBrony> just no...
<Natleyn> OH!
<Stomper> then wy have me join?
<Natleyn> I see
<Plorf> SixSpeed: I would say these sound sufficiently different
<Plorf> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC58-DYyKRs
<Natleyn> Thanks herospirit :3
<Xiagu> I heard that they didn't make one at all, at least that's what I remember Daniel saying earlier
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<MetalRainbowDash> Ah. it's so boring.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about UKF Bass Culture (Dubstep Megamix)
<Heavy_Metal_Boombox> GRAWUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<MirthTinker> 13the bear wasn't in the zodiac?
<Xiagu> Sibsy said that she has the good one

<BeatleBrony> True
<SixSpeed> Alllll sorts.

*LunaOnTheMoon directs mysteriousanimatorx to #EquestriaDailyAfterDark
<herospirit> Erm. Ask someone else Fluttershy.
<Spin> I did it for 3 hours of epic sax guy
<VioletVanilla> 6Halloooo~ What are you doing all the way over here? o:
<Fluttershy> -tears up, biting her lip-
<Spin> never again
*herospirit absconds to Nat's corner
<SixSpeed> Oop.
<SixSpeed> Buffering
<Blums> Isnt it Equestria
<mysteriousanimatorx> Oh, I don't want to go to a dirty shippy smeary clop room.
<roushguy> I found even more Fluttershy-inspired music
<Silvermane> Don't cry Fluttershy. I've just starred in a few ship-fics is all
<Natleyn> :3
<roushguy> I'm soooooooooooo happy
<roushguy> I could just
<MetalRainbowDash> *Robbery ponies attack Ponyville*
<herospirit> I'm being generous
<SixSpeed> It stopped at 5:43.

<Blums> AfterDark? no Daily?
*MetalRainbowDash runs to VioletVanlla and other ponies.
<Spin> Roushguy links?

<mysteriousanimatorx> isn't THIS eqdaily?
<MetalRainbowDash> ROBBERY PONIES ARE HERE IN PONYVILLE!
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Foozogz - Fluttershy Likes Being Nice (CUTENESS OVERLOAD MIX)
<herospirit> I think he may be a child, from how he writes. :0
<Natleyn> I like shade. :3
<Silvermane> 15Rainbow Dash always dresses in style
<Fluttershy> we should rp in here... I don't like MetalRainbowDash very much unfortunately =-=; ]
<mysteriousanimatorx> CLAWP
<Silvermane> 15who knows. not paying attention to him
<MetalRainbowDash> HELLO?!/
<MetalRainbowDash> I SAID
<herospirit> Ahahaha, Silvermane, a few?
<Spin> Yes it is EqDaily
<herospirit> erm
<Lapsus> mysteriousanimatorx: we're not ALWAYS at it you know
<MetalRainbowDash> THERE ARE ROBBERY PONIES!
<Lapsus> :p
<DecapKing> 4well there is somewhere else to RP......
*herospirit absconds back to Nat's corner
<Silvermane> herospirit, it's less than 10, so yes a few
<mysteriousanimatorx> at it? at WHAT? lol
<SixSpeed> It's EqD with naughty nickers.
<MetalRainbowDash> -_-
<Denied_Existence> 3RD: I'M GONNA STAB A BITCH
<Silvermane> 15decapKing, shh
<herospirit> what?
<Lapsus> [22:39] <mysteriousanimatorx> Oh, I don't want to go to a dirty shippy smeary clop room.
<roushguy> :(
<Lapsus> It's not that bad, is what I'm saying :v
<Fluttershy> Hm? Where? o-o
<roushguy> My brother's yelling at me for the music
<mysteriousanimatorx> I don't get the whole after dark crow. Sexualizing ponies meant for little girls? I dunno....
<Fluttershy> I like RPing.
*VioletVanilla giggles at Natleyn, sitting down on her haunches in the shady corner.
<herospirit> We have an RP server? Or do you mean....
<DecapKing> 4comic con
<mysteriousanimatorx> er..crew
<Fluttershy> .........
<SixSpeed> roushguy, you work at Roush?
<VioletVanilla> 6I suppose it is nice. . . ^-^
<MetalRainbowDash> *Robbery ponies point gun at VioletVanilla's head*
<Silvermane> 15that is a secret and sacred place. only those who have proven themselves may enter
<herospirit> You don't mean erm... The uh
<Fluttershy> -runs off crying-
<roushguy> AD is like a slightly toned-toned version of /b/
<herospirit> Silvershipper.
<MirthTinker> 13ummm, sorry to burst your bubble Decap, but I think he got away
<DecapKing> 4no
<Denied_Existence> ......NOooooo
<Spin> That reminds me how long have I been in the #bucketofholding chat?
<Silvermane> 15course not
<Spin> :P
<IAmNotAGoat> Wouldn't AD be just shipping things heavily?
<DecapKing> 4i meant like LARPing
<roushguy> SixSpeed, no I'm not
*MetalRainbowDash kills the robbery ponies.
*Denied_Existence jumps in front of the gun barrel.
*VioletVanilla turns and shoop-da-whoops the robbery ponies.
*Silvermane 15larps
*DecapKing 4turns around
<roushguy> I'm related to Jack Roush
<DecapKing> 4huh

<Natleyn> :D
<MetalRainbowDash> *Princess Celestia comes to VioletVanilla*
<herospirit> that's a thing now
<SixSpeed> You should know that he's a jerk.
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Have to go, bye.
<Silvermane> 15oh really?

<MetalRainbowDash> Princess Celestia: What is going on here?

<Natleyn> Bye Rainbow_dash!
<herospirit> I've made a couple weapons for boffing/larping
<DecapKing> 4but anyways dont go to the mentioned server above
<Denied_Existence> 3Standbye for much stabbing
<roushguy> http://www.roush.org/
<Silvermane> 15decapking, shhhh
<herospirit> Oh yah, don't go to Silvershipper
<SixSpeed> Right.
<roushguy> Anything/body on that page
<Lemon_Lime> Yo!
<VioletVanilla> 6Goodbye Rainbow_Dash! c:
<MirthTinker> 13well, not like I can control him *points to vacant forhead* I have no horn
*Spin is currently 6 minutes into the Applebloom video.. I can do this.
*Silvermane 15licks Mirthtinker's cheek. "Thanks Tinkerbelle"
<DecapKing> 4shit can get real in there
<roushguy> I'm related to, even if it is extremely distantly
<herospirit> Really, just don't. :0
<Fluttershy> Yeah.. o-o I used to Larp with my best friend all the time
<SixSpeed> Cool cool.
<MetalRainbowDash> Princess Celestia: What is going on here, Violet?
<Silvermane> 15stop namedropping it
<Skipsy> hahah, my friend requested a ponified version of himself, this is the result. http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/Drawings/Screenshot_000006.jpg
<Natleyn> More accurately, I like darkness. Not complete, just mostly dark, like just after twilight or just before dawn.
<DecapKing> 4i didnt name drop it
<Fluttershy> Because I'm attending classes on the weekdays though I haven't had much of a chance recently
<MirthTinker> 13No problem hubby, let me trot you to your bed
<Silvermane> 15where did you play Fluttershy?
<DecapKing> 4Herospirit did
<roushguy> I've occasionally considered sending 'Uncle' Jack a letter asking if I can borrow $20
<VioletVanilla> 6This is mighty true q.q
<Silvermane> 15not you Decapking, herospirit
<Denied_Existence> 3What? did you say Silvershipper?
<SixSpeed> hah
<Natleyn> I like the sun too, but it's night now.
<Denied_Existence> 3xD
*Silvermane 15facehoofs
<DecapKing> 4and so did DE
<ValtheJean> :P
<Luna> 07soo
<SixSpeed> He used to pay me to work at one of his buildings.
<DecapKing> 4but i did not say Silvershipper at all
<Luna> 07Fluttershy made a sketch
<ValtheJean> Caramel is alpha you know :P
<Silvermane> 15k
<ValtheJean> already?
*MirthTinker 13carries the incapacitated colt upstairs and into his room, laying him on his bed gently.
<Lapsus> Skipsy: That's awesome
<herospirit> Hey, she deserves to have the choice. Of whether or not to go to Silvershipper.
*Denied_Existence 3is bi-winning.
<ValtheJean> wow, she is a hard worker :P
<SixSpeed> At least, his name was on the checks.
*Silvermane 15crawls under a rock now
<Luna> 07she wants to know the details when we plan on the marathon.. what did we decide again?
<herospirit> #silvershipper even.
<roushguy> LUCKY
<DecapKing> 4except that one time that i said Silvershipper
<VioletVanilla> 6It was an accident. She closed her eyes and the next thing she knew, there it was.
*^Stargazer wears his FLCL shirt
<Denied_Existence> 3...
<Luna> 07i'm doing so many things... my head hurts
<SixSpeed> Nah.
*SixSpeed is rockin' NASA shirt.
<ValtheJean> right after BMN
<roushguy> I sometimes wish I could meet him IRL
<ValtheJean> streaming until the S2 premiere, yes?
*VioletVanilla hugs Luna :c
<Luna> 07and when would that be?
<Lemon_Lime> Skipsy
<Fluttershy> Oh, I would just hang out with my friend and we would larp whenever and wherever we could, though most larping was in either at her or my house. Most larping happened at my house though, specifically in my room d;
<VioletVanilla> 6Do not overextend yourself. . .
<Lemon_Lime> You're really good!
<SixSpeed> Jack Roush is kinda short-tempered and a jerk to his employees.
<herospirit> SILVERMANE YOU BEEN TROLLED.
*RainbowDashCancel is wearing Team Rocket shirt
<DecapKing> 4but anyways i wouldnt go there, except that time that i went there
<Skipsy> Danke, hehe
<herospirit> THAT IS ALL.
<Octavia> 13Do we need an exact time?
<VioletVanilla> 6Next Thursday night I believe was the thought.
<Silvermane> 15ohh, so you've never been to an event, Fluttershy?
<SixSpeed> And by short-tempered and a jerk I mean I never saw him smile or heard him say anything nice.
<Skipsy> I've only started at drawing ponies, so it's.... different.
<MetalRainbowDash> *Day time*
<Spin> When you doing your next livestream?
<Fluttershy> -shakes her head- Not like that anyway
*Natleyn in the shade
<Silvermane> 15i hate you guys so much
<Razyn> 11(Out of fucking nowhere :0)
*MetalRainbowDash *yawn* what time is it?
<roushguy> So he's uncool?
<Silvermane> 15thanks Tink
<roushguy> Ah well
<roushguy> still
<MetalRainbowDash> Wh.. what hapepned?
<MetalRainbowDash> happened
<Skipsy> I could right now maybe
<Razyn> 11What?
<^Stargazer> man, has it been raining like crazy this week
<roushguy> I'd ask him for twenty bucks if I met him
<roushguy> :P
<Silvermane> 15hmm, where you located?
<Razyn> 11Why?
<DecapKing> 4you're welcome for that trolling Silvermane
<herospirit> I have a ductape/PVCpipe/Foam broadsword in my closet :0
<MetalRainbowDash> Did I crash here?
<^Stargazer> it better not rain next week when I'm on vacation
<Luna> 07if possible
<DecapKing> 4you didnt do anything Razyn
<SixSpeed> He liked to buzz the Roush complex with his P51.
<Octavia> 13We know we want to do it after BMN, but... why do we need an exact time? If its for marketing, could we simply put "Immediately after Brony Movie Night" os such?
<Fluttershy> I've never larped in a big group or at a con. I've never been to a con. The con I'll be attending this year will be my first
<VioletVanilla> 6It is getting kind of cold. . .
<Fluttershy> I'm located in Utah, remember? o-o
*Silvermane 15has a 32 inch latex scimitar with matchin 10" dagger
<MetalRainbowDash> Oh yeah. It is.
<DecapKing> 4we were trolling Silvermane by namedropping this to Fluttershy
*VioletVanilla sneezes lightly~ >~<
<MetalRainbowDash> I think it's Winter here.
<Octavia> 13*or
<Silvermane> 15nope, didn't remember you saying the where
*Natleyn hands Violet some tissues
<Lemon_Lime> Skipsy. Livestream! :D
<Denied_Existence> 3D-->You appear to be in deep shit. Herospirit, you b100 b100d.
<Razyn> 11Ah.
<herospirit> I never got around to painting my broadsword. :[
<Silvermane> 15great.
<DecapKing> 4it was funny
<Skipsy> Yup, just rearranging some of my windows to better suit streaming. lol
<Spin> I could watch a livestream .. if my internet will let me
<Octavia> 13Since its hard to pin point an exact time. That or perhaps Midnight EST.
<MetalRainbowDash> Violet
*Silvermane 15rolls over onto his stomach in bed.
<VioletVanilla> 6Or we could just not specify on the actual drawing and add the text later perhaps?
<MetalRainbowDash> I think you should get home.
<ReticentSmolder> 5seriously...we can kick people who do that kind of stuff right?
<JackiePie> You must pray to the internet Gods
<Silvermane> 15don't paint it
<Octavia> 13Gotta look at how long our current movies will hold us up for.
<MetalRainbowDash> You too, Natleyn
<Luna> 07I'll link the draft
<Luna> 07hang on
<Skipsy> http://www.livestream.com/skipsysdoodles
<ValtheJean> well also, we don't know what movies will be picked this BMN
<Natleyn> I'll be fine, but I'll make sure to get home soon.
<Octavia> 13Oh wait, we dont have next weeks movies yet. Derp. lol
<ValtheJean> I still say we enact super special mod powers and make our own list
<herospirit> D_E: I'm JuSt MoThErFuCkIn GoIn WiTh ThE fLoW, bRo. :o)
<MetalRainbowDash> Ok
<Silvermane> 15never bother painting weapons like that. it chips, hardens the weapon, etc etc etc
<Octavia> 13I know, I'm also doing many things at once.
<ValtheJean> that way we can time it out perfectly
<herospirit> : o )
<Octavia> 13So I'm a little slow.
<Luna> 07http://i.imgur.com/J2xwE.jpg
<VioletVanilla> 6Thank you Natleyn. . . and Metal for the warning.
<JackiePie> I know that seems random, but I have been watching a show about exorcisms.
<Spin> I'm setting up my alter as we speak.
<Silvermane> 15meh
<JackiePie> lol
<Spin> *altar
<Natleyn> I grew up in Cloudsdale, so I'm used to cold
<Silvermane> 15idc all that much.
<MetalRainbowDash> For what warning?
<herospirit> what would you suggest Silver?
<Luna> 07dat sketch
<MetalRainbowDash> Getting home?
<roushguy> I already have my altar
<Silvermane> 15colored duct tape
<roushguy> My laptop
<SixSpeed> I do not approve of your altars.
<Silvermane> 15electrical tape
<Octavia> 13Dash looks a little odd. lol
<SixSpeed> You must appease me betterer.
<ValtheJean> eh, it's just a sketch
<DecapKing> 4THROUGH A MOTHERFUCKIN FISH EYE LENS!
*VioletVanilla smiles at Natleyn. (:
<herospirit> Mmmm. I believe I know where I can acquire such assets.
<Luna> 07she needs imput now
<Fluttershy> dang it... rping and larping are two things I love so much. I've roleplayed so many characters both male and female that I've created from scratch with my best friend e-e;
<Luna> 07so what do we tell her?
*Natleyn smiles back :)
<VioletVanilla> 6I bet you get a lot of it. . . Being a flier and all.
<ValtheJean> well, it's a little clumped at the bottom
<mexican> hi everypony
<VioletVanilla> 6Dari would be disappoint.
<Silvermane> 15hmm, LARPing is a very surreal experience.
<mib_5qbfpx> So the topic is set in stone that Rainbow Dash is the best pony ever?
<VioletVanilla> 6but I like it as a rough sketch. . .
<ValtheJean> it might be a good idea to go for a more even distribution in the negative space
<DecapKing> 4so is bow hunting
<MetalRainbowDash> Well, she is a good pegasus pony.
<mexican> helloooooo
<mib_5qbfpx> Then I guess there's no arguing that
<Spin> Erects internet monument."GODS WILL YOU ANSWER ME NOW!?"
<MetalRainbowDash> She did some Sonic Rainbooms.
<Fluttershy> It is! And we'd get so involved in it too it almost became real for us
*roushguy speaks like Dr. Nick from the Simpsons.
<Fluttershy> Well, in a sense it did
<roushguy> HI EVERYBODY!
<mexican> hi roushguy
<GRRM> man, I hate my internet
<ValtheJean> also, I think Bronystate should be a bit bigger
<mib_5qbfpx> Very true.
<roushguy> I can see from here that you have too much blood.
<JackiePie> Got bored, turned on TruTV's shocking videos
<GRRM> comcast is terrible
<ValtheJean> that should be where our eyes go to
<mexican> we need some leeches
<roushguy> Let's get you covered in LEECHEEEES!
<herospirit> Hmmm... Nat and Violet are RPing with MRD.
<mib_5qbfpx> That is something I cannot argue with.
<ValtheJean> right now the focal point is on Pinkie Pie
<mexican> lol
<mib_5qbfpx> But on the contrary,
<Silvermane> 15at the 4day i went to, my new character was a fox-type beast man. basically i ran around and caused trouble for 2 days, got eaten by a giant plant, and entertained people by not getting massive inuendos and misunderstanding a job offering to a brothel as a request to be put in soup
<brony_v> No Rainbow Dash = no MLP.
<mib_5qbfpx> Fluttershy is awesome
<Natleyn> Get a lot of cold? o.o
<herospirit> are they exhibiting the emotion you call... pity?
<Octavia> 13I like it overall. I dont want to ask her to have to redrawn it all over again.
*ValtheJean is trying to be as creatively constructive as possible :-/
<Denied_Existence> 3Although II truthfully enjoy 2peakiing a2 20llux the most.
<JackiePie> eww!
<SixSpeed> Man
<roushguy> So
<Fluttershy> o-o thanks?
<SixSpeed> LEECHES are the way of the pastfuture.
<roushguy> What to do
*Silvermane 15fans himself, muttering something about MirthTinker and scrolls
<VioletVanilla> 6Get a lot OF the cold. Being in the clouds and all I mean. . .
<Octavia> 13BronyState is a little slanted, but I'm not expecting Wrek quality work here. :P
<Fluttershy> wow, sounds fun ^^
<mib_5qbfpx> Np
<Denied_Existence> 3Silvermane That sounds awesome
<roushguy> Can't watch ponies, brother will complain, and I don't want him to wake up my mom and drag her into the argument
<GRRM> well, I just finished Dragonshy and Sonic Rainboom
<GRRM> ...I can't believe I'm saying this... I like My Little Pony: Friendship is magic
<mib_5qbfpx> Was wondering why the text for "Fluttershy" was green >_<
<roushguy> Can't listen to ponymusic, for the same reason
<Luna> 07well wait till you see the end result :P
<mib_5qbfpx> Thought it was just my eyes
<Natleyn> Yeah, but I like the cold, so it's cool.
<herospirit> KARKAT IS THE FUCKING EASIEST TO IMITATE, YOU GRUB FUCK.
<Luna> 07so what should I tell her again?
<mexican> welcome to the herd GRRM
<Spin> GRPM: ONE OF US ONE OF US!!
<Denied_Existence> Hey anon.
<VioletVanilla> 6What are you doing in Ponyville then?
<Fluttershy> it's green hehe ^^;
<Octavia> 13We'll see, we'll see. :P
<DecapKing> 4i'd still rather go bow hunting
<Denied_Existence> How goes it?
<Silvermane> 15then I got tired of all the noobies getting killed, so I swapped out to my human woodsman who is an expert in healing skills
<GRRM> welp
<Xiagu> !link welcome_to_the_herd
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<JackiePie> OMG, they had a video of a carnival park swing ride, and the top of the ride fell off.
<Xiagu> ^^ for shame
<Octavia> 13RD and Twi look a bit close together.
<roushguy> GRRM: I fell in love with it after meeting Fluttershy. I literally felt my heart melt. In addition, welcome to the herd!
<VioletVanilla> 6Hallo Fluttershy~
<Razyn> 11Bed. Me. Time. Syntax. Grammar. Important to. Not me.
<herospirit> Just gotta yell and curse a lot.
<Luna> 07this is her DA
<ValtheJean> well, I dunno if anyone else agrees with me
<Luna> 07http://kimikonyanchan.deviantart.com/
<DecapKing> 4cause that deer jerky just tastes soooo good
<Silvermane> 15bow hunting humans is more fun. especially in pitch dark woods and full contact allowed
<brony_v> It's like that whenever you type another user's name, mib_5qbfpx
<Fluttershy> I should mention that the larping I did with my best friend was special... >>
<roushguy> I can't draw though
<roushguy> Or write
<Octavia> 13Kinda a big blank spot up in the middle of AJ and Pinkie
<GRRM> welp
<mexican> where are u from GRRM?
<DecapKing> 4bow chicka wow wow?
<Spin> I think I'm going to watch The Best Night Ever sometime tonight.
*VioletVanilla waves her hoof at the lemon coloured filly.
<roushguy> Or I'd contribute to the fanon
<GRRM> where am I from?
*Silvermane 15raises his eyebrows. 'What he said...'
<stomper2> ::_:: good bye cruel world!
<Natleyn> I like the cold, but I like hanging around my friends more :3
<GRRM> as in where do I live?
<Spin> Yes
<Fluttershy> Hi ^^
<JackiePie> The entire top of the ride just fell down
<GRRM> or where did I hear about this show?
<mexican> !link http://www.synchtube.com/r/IsaacShark#
<Silvermane> 15bye Razyn
<DerpyBot> Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
<mib_5qbfpx> Yes, but didn't realize someone in the chat was using that name >.>
<Spin> I'm in Maine
<MirthTinker> 13(possible drama inc, my mother just got home)
<ValtheJean> actually, you know what
<mexican> its a live stream
<roushguy> Circleville Ohio.
<Denied_Existence> 3 8leh,,,,,,, I still think that Viskraa is pretty cool though. ::::D
<Fluttershy> o-o; No, that's an accurate description. We were bfwb
<Denied_Existence> 3Fuck
<ValtheJean> I think they should be more clustered on the left side of the page
<Denied_Existence> 3:::: )
*MetalRainbowDash goes to sleep.
<Octavia> 13Eh, some of her work is really good and some of it is kinda... meh. To be completely honest. :|
<MirthTinker> 13(let's hope she'll leave me alone tonight >.>)
<DecapKing> 4get into your bombshelter then
<MetalRainbowDash> *Night Time*
<GRRM> oh, I live in Utah... (No, I'm not a mormon)
<GRRM> since I know you guys will ask that
<brony_v> What do you expect? It's a MLP chat, after all :P
<Silvermane> 15huh. that's interesting.
<Luna> 07I know :)
*MirthTinker 13huddles in the shelter
<roushguy> Pumpkin Show is later this year, it's the world's largest festival of its kind.
<mib_5qbfpx> You are asleep...yet you still speak?
<DecapKing> 4what?
<roushguy> Actually
<Fluttershy> were, though... past tense... =-=
<mexican> i wouldnt
<ValtheJean> draw the eyes to the left
<ValtheJean> then they follow the words naturally'
<ValtheJean> give the wording section the most negative space so it has the most attention
<Octavia> 13More clustered on the left side?
<roushguy> I think Pumpkin Show is later this month
<Spin> I wouldn't
<ValtheJean> yeah
<sumica> On movies nights we tend to have the mane 6
<mexican> im mexican and i dont wear a sombrero
<ValtheJean> natural eye progression
<ValtheJean> we read from left to right
*Silvermane 15hopes nothing happens whilst he is forced to lay prone
<sumica> and then some.
<VioletVanilla> 6Maybe this. . .
<Fluttershy> Because it's been a while since we did any larping, so now the only form of roleplay we do is online
<DecapKing> 4nevermind i think i got it
<Spin> You dont?
<herospirit> Pshh, maybe she WOULD fit in with Silvershipper.
<mexican> im not into stereotypes
<DecapKing> 4so it was bow chicka wow wow?
<herospirit> *suggestive eyebrows*
<mexican> no, no sombrero
<roushguy> I'm 21 and I act 12
<ValtheJean> put the ponies on the left side, then your eyes naturally follow the wording
<Silvermane> 15... maybe in a few days
<Fluttershy> -nods- I miss kissing her and do other things ;-;
<HotCocoa> I'm 13 and I act 31
<mexican> nor mustache
<HotCocoa> Wait
<Blums> oh dear..
<Fluttershy> doing*
<HotCocoa> Strike that
<MetalRainbowDash> sumica, we're chat roleplaying.
<HotCocoa> Reverse it
<Octavia> 13I dunno, I tend to like even distribution for things like this.

<DecapKing> 4HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
<GRRM> I'm a cranky geezer

<mib_5qbfpx> No, we're not "roleplaying", we're just a couple of ponies from Ponyville chatting it up
<Denied_Existence> 3*Insert image of tavros twitching his eyebrows*
*Boombox notices Razyn is gone. He scrambles to catch up.
<Luna> 07dear god
<SixSpeed> AND I ACT AS I DAMN WELL PLEASE
<mib_5qbfpx> Remember, it's 1864
<Octavia> 13Clustering them would have to be done just so.
<Luna> 07dat poor gal is gonna receive a big wall of text
*DecapKing 4sneaks into Silvermane's house
<Fluttershy> Dude.

<RainbowDashWins> I'm 24 and I act 14 or 44, depending on the day and the number of idiot drivers that have nearly killed me.
<ValtheJean> >.<

<Octavia> 13Like I said, I dont want to make her have to refraw the entire thing... lol
<Silvermane> 15oh dear. Fluttershy in the shipper
<Fluttershy> Am I going to regret joining?
<SixSpeed> Ask me what I think about driving.
<ValtheJean> oh: one more thing
<^Stargazer> em...
<Fluttershy> And I'm a girl, dude.
*DecapKing 4looks around
<Octavia> 13*redraw
<VioletVanilla> 6I just think, even distribution. Having maybe thre on top, three on bottom instead o four on bottom, three on top.
<Luna> 07give me a tldr
<Spin> Blums: Lol Wut?
<ValtheJean> without any prespective, the ponies are dis-proportionate
*Denied_Existence 3decides that all bets are off.
<DecapKing> 4damn, you really dont have anything to steal
<MetalRainbowDash> Attention Everypony!
<GRRM> whoa
<GRRM> new season already?
<herospirit> Probably Fluttershy.
<VioletVanilla> 6OOOONNNNEEEE MOOOOORRREEE THIIIINNNNGGG!

<RainbowDashWins> Driving would be awesome if no one else was on the road.
<mib_5qbfpx> *listening*
<HotCocoa> GRRM 8 days
<GRRM> man, I need to catchup with this show
<SixSpeed> "already" he says.
*Denied_Existence 3takes a sip from his silver flask.
<MetalRainbowDash> The Pony Singing Contest is coming up.
<herospirit> I know I did!
<Spin> the 17th
<Fluttershy> Loffly.
<Blums> its been three or fourt months since the last one grrm
<herospirit> Maybe I'll go lurk there again.
<DecapKing> 4Hello Fluttershy, please choose insanity level
<GRRM> that's not too bad
<ValtheJean> I'm a horrible, horrible person, aren't I?
<Xiagu> GRRM, you don't have to wait, lucky
<MetalRainbowDash> If you want to audition, come to the theater today at 3 PM
<Fluttershy> Umm.... hmmm.
*herospirit lurks
<mib_5qbfpx> FANTASTIC!...I can't enter :(
<Spin> Sorry Skipsy my interweb is not nice to me.
<Silvermane> 15wait, who didn't know you were a filly, Fluttershy?
*Luna cries
<Octavia> 13No Val lol
<mexican> !link http://www.synchtube.com/r/IsaacShark# for those of you who want to watch the last chapters
<HotCocoa> GRRM: Marathon it.
<DerpyBot> Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
<GRRM> I had to wait 5 years for A Dance with Dragons
<HotCocoa> This weekend.
<GRRM> I'm a patient man
<Denied_Existence> 3Blame herospirit
<Fluttershy> herospirit?
<Octavia> 13I'm just trying to think in ways that wont make her have to erase half or more of it.
<Silvermane> 15as the name implies, this is my channel of shipping
<Xiagu> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/46594 for future use
<herospirit> Everyone hit her with your best. :I
<Skipsy> lol, it's fine
<RainbowDashWins> As it is, either I've got someone going 10 under in front of me, or someone who wants to go 20 over behind me. On two-lane roads with very few passing zones.
<Fluttershy> Shipping yourself? o-o
<brony_v> Heh heh heh...
<ValtheJean> understandable
<SixSpeed> Marathon it for real. Run a marathon, one episode per mile.
*herospirit absconds to the corner
<Fluttershy> What... what are you going to do to me? >>
<Silvermane> 15created with the intent of a safe haven for shipping stories that get above bronystate's pg13 limites
<Denied_Existence> 3inb4 Silvermane eats herospirit
<Skipsy> My internet is probably just as bad, it seems to cut out every little bit, and restart the stream.
<Luna> 07I like AJ's position
<ValtheJean> but at the same time, if the end product isn't agreeable, then we've kinda wasted fluttershy's time
<Octavia> 13Hard though.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about happy reaction_face let_go_of_your_hate macro reaction_image (and 6 more)
<SixSpeed> RainbowDashWins, psh
<Octavia> 13Yeah, I like AJ sitting on the letters.
<roushguy> I'm very sad
<Silvermane> 15do? not much. currently i'm prone in bed trying not to cry
<DecapKing> 4Insanity level set to: o-o
<SixSpeed> PASS ON DOUBLE YELLOW
<roushguy> Wait
<SixSpeed> Nobody will follow you.
<mib_5qbfpx> I must have misplaced my watch, what time is it currently?
<DecapKing> 4hey Fluttershy
<ValtheJean> it's much better to be nit-picky now when it's just in sketches
<roushguy> I can always play DF or NWN2
<Denied_Existence> 3......
<MetalRainbowDash> 2:30 PM
<herospirit> What? What did I do?
<roushguy> Not sure I wanna play DF though
<Octavia> 13I think it'll look good in any case. Just might not be as great as it could have been.
*Silvermane 15doesn't eat herospirit. He feeds him to a gru
<Fluttershy> Insanity level... -smiles evilly-
<herospirit> I knew she was a girl O-O
<SixSpeed> You want to Minecraft.
<VioletVanilla> 6I think the main thing is how scrunched the four are on the bottom and how Rarity looks like she. . . . is just cast aside. . .
<Fluttershy> Try me.
<Denied_Existence> 3I would do nothing to you Fluttershy, not unless you wanted me to.
<SixSpeed> In preparation.
<roushguy> nah
<brony_v> Oh snap, looks like we'll have to think up songs on the spot!
<roushguy> I'm not a MC nut
<Denied_Existence> 3Don't make me call up Emerald...
<mib_5qbfpx> Is it 3 PM now?
<RainbowDashWins> Nah, I'm not in that much of a hurry, especially on the weekends when I'm driving my good car. :P
<roushguy> I do have it
<Silvermane> 15MirthTinker, meet Fluttershy.
<MetalRainbowDash> Yes.
<roushguy> But I don't spend hours playing
<MetalRainbowDash> XD
<Octavia> 13I thought RD had an odd face too. lol
<MirthTinker> 13...wat?
<mib_5qbfpx> Did I miss it now?
<mexican> which is your favorite song?
<SixSpeed> "Good car"
<Luna> 07right and now let's make it a small wall of text :)
<MetalRainbowDash> No.
<SixSpeed> What is your good car?
<MetalRainbowDash> Your on time
<DecapKing> 4Note, to reset insanity level, please give me all of your possessions
<brony_v> Whoa, that was the fastest half hour ever12

<VioletVanilla> 6DERPY DASH
<mib_5qbfpx> Woohoo!
<Denied_Existence> 3*Facehoof*
<Silvermane> 15DE, I still need to meet this Emerald. I need to see her skills live, honestly. it was an interesting read, that log of hers
<Octavia> 13And Fluttershys nose is so edged and pointy. :P
<Spin> I'm sitting here fighting off grins as I stare at my new Fluttershy flashdrive :)
<VioletVanilla> 6:D!!
<MetalRainbowDash> First up is..
<DecapKing> 4(DE, call her and get her here)
<Fluttershy> It depends on how you want me to act? Is this an RP or what is going to happen?
<GRRM> guess I joined at the right time
<MetalRainbowDash> Cutie Mark Crusaders.
<herospirit> My "dude" was a reply to Silvermane's "dude.
<MirthTinker> 13wait...is she Emerald?
<roushguy> winter wrap up, winter wrap uuuuup, cause tomorrow spring is here!
<`BlacklightShining> XD
<Fluttershy> I honestly have no idea what's going on so... yeah.
<DecapKing> 4nope
<Silvermane> 15no she isn't
*Luna scratches her head
<brony_v> God help us all.
<`BlacklightShining> I want a Rainbow flash drive
<Denied_Existence> 3She isn't on, or I would.
<DecapKing> 4she is Fluttershy
<Fluttershy> Dudette is me? o-o
<ValtheJean> lol, but Luna I am an English major! Large walls of text is my forte!
<mexican> little creatures hybernate under the snow and ice
<`BlacklightShining> but they don't have them in 16 GB DX
<MetalRainbowDash> *After Cutie Mark's performance*
<Silvermane> 15Fluttershy, this is just random chat that occasionally has RP and shipping and wtf moments
<MetalRainbowDash> NEXT!
<DecapKing> 4anyways,
<MetalRainbowDash> Anyone next?
<Luna> 07smaller, pretty please?
<RainbowDashWins> '65 Mustang hardtop with the straight six.
<mib_5qbfpx> Time sure does fly by
<herospirit> They do. Uh. I'm not sure what they do here
<DecapKing> 4Note, to reset insanity level, please give me all of your possessions
<Spin> on DashDrives?
<Octavia> 13Since their actual designs are so rounded, curves for those things are your friends. :P
<Fluttershy> What is your definition of 'shipping'?
<SixSpeed> Hnnng
<VioletVanilla> 6Okay. . . How is this?
*roushguy wanders away, humming the tune to himself
<Xiagu> I want a dash drive, but I want a USB 3.0 one
<ReticentSmolder> 5oh, well allow me to introduce myself, I'm ReticentSmolder, writer, rp'er, and npc voiceover extraordinaire
<mexican> if you get a RD drive can you get me one?
<mib_5qbfpx> No pun intended...
<`BlacklightShining> ^
<Xiagu> usb 3.0 is amaaaaaziiiiing
<`BlacklightShining> 2^ *]
<Spin> they have em up to 64GB i thought
<brony_v> mib_5qbfpx would like to sing a song.
<`BlacklightShining> 2^ * *
<RainbowDashCancel> I want a Rainbow Dash prism tshirt
<MetalRainbowDash> Ok.
<Denied_Existence> 3Also it has Cl-I MEAN GREAT FUN
<Silvermane> 15Also massive schizophrenic. but more on that later
<`BlacklightShining> Spin: not the swivel ones
<mib_5qbfpx> I do?
<MetalRainbowDash> Sing.
<`BlacklightShining> and that's the only one I like
<brony_v> Yes, you do.
<mib_5qbfpx> Ugggh...
<Fluttershy> Alter egos... you know what those are?
<Fluttershy> I have them.
<mib_5qbfpx> Old MacDonald had a farm...
<Fluttershy> Many of them.
<ReticentSmolder> 5shipping is describing the romantic involvement of two ponies of any gender, ranging from platonic friendships to saucy relationships
<SixSpeed> I do need a new flash drive or two.
<mib_5qbfpx> E-I-E-I-O
<DecapKing> 4so do I
<`BlacklightShining> the /other/ one doesn't actually engrave the image on the drive itself
<MetalRainbowDash> NEXT!
<ValtheJean> I would say "Consistency in the character dimensions, more emphasis on Bronystate and a bit of tweaking on spacing". How about that?
<mib_5qbfpx> And on that farm he had a...
<Denied_Existence> 3Oh...well then you will fit right in Fluttershy
<mib_5qbfpx> WAIT
<Silvermane> 15we run the gambit on shipping here
<VioletVanilla> 6Fix Dash's eyes. Fluttershy's nose is a bit pointy, make Pinkie a tad smaller, and make them a little less scrunched together on the bottom.
<mib_5qbfpx> NOOOOO
<MetalRainbowDash> NEXT!!!!!
<Fluttershy> Right now I'm in MP mode. It stands for 'Master Puppeter'.
<`BlacklightShining> it puts it on a dog-tag thing
<sumica> (so do i have to type like this if I am not roleplaying?)
<RainbowDashCancel> The shirt's only $10.40, but I'm kinda broke right now
<SixSpeed> RainbowDashWins, that is a good car.
<ReticentSmolder> 5oh Fluttershy, you've already spoken to two of me tonight
<Xiagu> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/257
<MetalRainbowDash> NO! NOT OLD CLASSICAL SONGS
<mexican> we need that drive
<Spin> You can get all kinds of em not just swivvel.
<RainbowDashCancel> Maybe over the weekend when I get more money
<DecapKing> 4anyways Fluttershy,
<`BlacklightShining> [purpose setDefeated: YES] ;
<Luna> 07that will do
<DecapKing> 4Note, to reset insanity level, please give me all of your possessions
<Denied_Existence> 3Let me change over to my phone
<MetalRainbowDash> (Yes sumica)
<Fluttershy> I am in control of myself and my alter egos. The moment I switch to one you'd better be prepared.

<mexican> !seen GRRM
<DerpyBot> mexican: Silly filly, your eyes are all derpy. GRRM is in the channel.
<Xiagu> ohwait it's GRRM nvm.
<roushguy> It has only one problem
<Octavia> 13I think it'll look fine in any case anyway. This isn't our main banner. We dont have to have it perfect.
<DecapKing> 4Current Insanity Level: 0
<SixSpeed> My dad had a 64.5 droptop, RainbowDashWins. The poor thing was rusting so bad on the bottom that it was in danger of falling in on itself.
<roushguy> NO PONIES
<mexican> 6_9
<VioletVanilla> 6~yay~
<Fluttershy> -smirks- Who do you want first, biotches?
<GRRM> what?
<Xiagu> GRRM, http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/257 BETTER LATE THAN NEVER </caps>
<GRRM> what'd I do?
<RainbowDashCancel> hmm...usb 3.0
<DecapKing> 4Note, to reset insanity level, please give me all of your possessions
<Silvermane> 15mfw Fluttershy is a potty mouth. tsk tsk
<mib_5qbfpx> Hurray!
<RainbowDashCancel> what's so good about it?
<Luna> 07it's a event poster!
<Silvermane> 15DecapKing, sjut it
<ReticentSmolder> 5if you can imagine a ship, I can make a slapjob adhoc fic of the pairing on the spot, and I pride myself on doing exactly that on a moments notice :D
<SixSpeed> Faster.
<RainbowDashCancel> and how do I know whether my computer supports it?
<DecapKing> 4fine
<MetalRainbowDash> Well
<`BlacklightShining> ^
<Xiagu> RainbowDashCancel, faster
<Octavia> 13Yes, but remember one of the little morals. :P
<MetalRainbowDash> We didn't get any good singers.
<mib_5qbfpx> (Is there a convenient way to change my username besides refreshing the page?)
<Silvermane> 15thanks
<SixSpeed> How old is your computer?
<Xiagu> I like how my ninja was relevant to what you meant to ^, BlacklightAway
<Octavia> 13>dont look a gift horse in the mouth ;)
<MrEvergreen> USB 3.0 is backward compatible with 2.0 and possibly 1.1.
<VioletVanilla> 6I agree, this is not to look like Lauren Faust drew it, but we do want it to look neat and tidy at least.
<DecapKing> 4anywasys how insane do you want me to be?
<RainbowDashWins> %SixSpeed, that's a shame to hear that, rust is the worst enemy of great machines. Well...rust and thermodynamics.
<mexican> it doesnt matter if its a floppy disk, if its RD it will be 20% faster
<Silvermane> 15normal levels
<Octavia> 13It'll look fine.

<MetalRainbowDash> On the top
<ReticentSmolder> 5Decap, you're entering spam territory
<MetalRainbowDash> by Chat by mibbit.com
<Spin> Fact
<VioletVanilla> 6I know it will =.=
<sumica> (You could try /nick command but I think it's mods only)
<Octavia> 13Judging from her overall work on dA, I have confidence it will look good either way.
<Luna> 07<Fluttershy> e-e oh my. -salutes- Understood. I'll send in more sketches as well
<Luna> 07poor gal :(
<MrEvergreen> The problem is that the current commercial design is somewhat defected.
<Silvermane> 15oh BTW, technically Silvermane and MirthTinker are an item. It's canon
<RainbowDashCancel> Ah crap, I forgot when I got this computer, but it's definitely newer than 2009.
<ValtheJean> I'm sorry :(
<MetalRainbowDash> oh shit
<VioletVanilla> 6inb4 off-model SonicDash
<SuperBrony64> (Okay, that's better)
<MetalRainbowDash> forgot to add the ()s
<MrEvergreen> They need to fix it.
<Octavia> 13Aww, thats why I didnt want to give her too much. lol
<GRRM> USB 3.0 is higher than USB 2.0
<SixSpeed> Agreed, RainbowDashWins...my poor car needs new control arm bushings, which means new arms. And it's showing rust.
<Octavia> 13lol
<GRRM> fact
<VioletVanilla> 6She will be fine.
<RainbowDashCancel> oh herp
<RainbowDashCancel> derp
<SuperBrony64> D:
<herospirit> Told you he was a player
<brony_v> (/nick's not working for me)
<RainbowDashCancel> I got this computer in summer 2010
<Fluttershy> o-o
<ValtheJean> I don't mean any negativity towards her, just it's good to point out these things >.<
<Octavia> 13What I've been saying... lol
<SuperBrony64> That's not very nice to swear Rainbow Dash
<VioletVanilla> 6From her DA she does things very well, very quickly.
<Luna> 07We should make more use of DA.. maybe even contest
<MrEvergreen> @SixSpeed: Time for a new augmentation?
*Octavia 13facehoofs
<MirthTinker> 13hehe yup, YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM HE'S MINE, um I mean, we're deeply passionate about our relationship
<herospirit> errrm
<DecapKing> 4uh, i would not say that to Fluttershy, dont want her to go flutterrage on your ass
<Fluttershy> -narrows her eyes- I seee
<MetalRainbowDash> (Sorry)
<SuperBrony64> There's tiny ponies in the room
<RainbowDashCancel> Man, it feels like I've had this computer for longer than that
<Octavia> 13Hmm...
<Luna> 07<Luna> They loved AJ's position
<Luna> 07<Fluttershy> Oh? ^^ yay
<Octavia> 13Yay contests!

<Silvermane> 15do what you want outside of here
<SuperBrony64> Oh, right. Just being nice.
<Octavia> 13As for contests, what would we do for prizes?
<mexican> is there a RD lap?
<Spin> I need a job
<SuperBrony64> >.>
<VioletVanilla> 6Free kittens
<MetalRainbowDash> Well, didn't get any good singers.
<ValtheJean> temporary modship (lol totally kidding)
<VioletVanilla> 6Free kittens for everypony!
<MetalRainbowDash> Thank god Justin Bieber Pony isn't here.
<Octavia> 13lol :P
<SuperBrony64> So, the contest is off?
<ReticentSmolder> 5yes, we'd love for you to contribute, but not everypony in mane chat or other rooms might respect our views or interests
*Silvermane 15flops under his covers. "That's better..."
<MetalRainbowDash> Guess so.
<Luna> 07hmm how about to get to pick the A movie / B movie / pony eps
<mexican> what kind of job?
<SixSpeed> RainbowDashWins, come put new control arms on my car.
<Octavia> 13sure, we get tons of free awesome art out of it. But we need to give something back too.
<SuperBrony64> :<
<ValtheJean> eh....regulars will be REALLY upset about that
<VioletVanilla> 6A for the first place, B for second, and pony eps for third place?
<Octavia> 13I dunno, you think that'll be enough Luna?
<ValtheJean> oh oh!
<ValtheJean> I GOT IT
<Fluttershy> I see... so you really are quite a player Silvermane. Making me feel important and special when all along you were with another pony! But of course!
<Mason_Trowel> I should've known it was only a matter of time before Alucard of Castlevania: SOTN was ponified.
<MetalRainbowDash> Wait
<GrimGallop> *Evil laugh*
<Luna> 07no no
<MetalRainbowDash> We have one more person to audition
*MirthTinker 13"Want me to get you some soup? There's some leftovers downstairs in the commons."
<ValtheJean> We invite them to do an art demonstration on the stream
<ValtheJean> free publicity for themselves
<Spin> anything a Junior in highschool could do to pay for ponies and ponies accesories.
<VioletVanilla> 6Ooooooooo~~~~
<Fluttershy> >:| No good dirty rotten idiotic player!
<Silvermane> 15Technically we are only an item in there. out here, I'm just random guy that gets shipped a lot
<MirthTinker> 13...wat?
<VioletVanilla> 6Get THEM publicity
<GRRM> hey
<Luna> 07that might be a good idea ^
<GRRM> I have a request
<VioletVanilla> 6I like.
<herospirit> kick his ass Fluttershy!
<SixSpeed> Shoot
<MetalRainbowDash> Roberto.
*DecapKing 4steps in between Fluttershy and Silvermane's bed
<Fluttershy> =_=;
<RainbowDashWins> Heh, wish I could, I'm actually not much of a mechanic. I just really love nice cars.
<Mason_Trowel> Although, I wasn't expecting it so soon after beginning another playthrough of the game
<MirthTinker> 13oh, THIS is news
<SuperBrony64> Oh well, way to pass time till Season 2
<DecapKing> 4whoa whoa whoa
<Octavia> 13Hmm...
<Octavia> 13If we could make it work.
<GRRM> could somebody make a Leon S. Kennedy ponified version?
*herospirit absconds to his safety corner
<DecapKing> 4we dont need any fighting here
<GRRM> from RE4
*Silvermane 15finds this moderately interesting. Then he rolls over for sleep
<MetalRainbowDash> Somebody named Roberto is last to audition.
<GRRM> and RE2
<SixSpeed> Can you just come hold my car up so I can put them on then?
<ValtheJean> it'd be easy really
<MirthTinker> 13Silvermane...you...you don't like me anymore?
<mexican> im not good at drawing, nor know him
<VioletVanilla> 6Streaming is simple and could be set up
<herospirit> Silvermane, you are the defination of Player.
<GRRM> I was just wondering if it's already been done
<GrimGallop> Roberto?
<SuperBrony64> Is there a Roberto in the room?
<VioletVanilla> 6How about like, a primetime spot during the pre-show?
<MirthTinker> 13Is it because I lost my magic? I CAN CHANGE!
<ValtheJean> they can either join the stream, pre-record a video that we stream, or we just make a video tour of their work
<MetalRainbowDash> Yeah.
<MetalRainbowDash> Wait..
<SixSpeed> Hmm.
<MetalRainbowDash> Where is he?
<Silvermane> 15eh. Silvermane is not a player. that implies i cheat
<DecapKing> 4even though it would be interesting to see Fluttershy kick Silvermane's ass
<ValtheJean> either way, anyone can get their stuff out there
<VioletVanilla> 6Show it when they will get the most views out of it.
<RainbowDashCancel> He better be wearing his jacket if someone ponifies him
<DecapKing> 4but none the less
<MetalRainbowDash> SuperBrony, and GrimGallop, go look for him.
<mexican> !link leon kennedy
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<mexican> nothing here
*GrimGallop searches
<ValtheJean> yeah, like during intermission of BMN or something
<RainbowDashCancel> !link leon_kennedy
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
*Silvermane 15facehoofs. "For Celestia's sake, I caused that, MirthTinker. And it's temporary anyways"
<Fluttershy> -narrows her eyes- Silvermane YOU ARE GOING DOWN!
<SuperBrony64> Okay...what does he look like?
<Mason_Trowel> !link resident_evil
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/9486
<Luna> 07Nah not intermission
<mexican> !link kennedy
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<MetalRainbowDash> people say..
<herospirit> She is going to do ALL KINDS OF THINGS to his ass!
<Octavia> 13Probably be longer than that I would think.
<MetalRainbowDash> He has..
<Luna> 07intermission is too short
<Silvermane> 15I'm already in bed. Just cut off the the legs and i'm down
<Octavia> 13I'd say before or after BMN>
<Luna> 07I say pre-show
<Fluttershy> I... I'm... you...
<MetalRainbowDash> Well
*DecapKing 4holds Fluttershy back
<ValtheJean> well we can always extend intermission. but pre-show is fine
<MetalRainbowDash> He's full blue
<Spin> For some reason I feel less accomplished today.. though I read 130 pages in my book. Probably didn't get enough ponies.
<MetalRainbowDash> And he has a biohazard.. cutie mark?
<ValtheJean> the only problem:
<Fluttershy> -screeches- I'm going to kill you!
<GRRM> yeah, I want him in his jacket
<RainbowDashWins> I'm actually learning how to work on nuclear reactors, not cars. Ahaha.
<ValtheJean> not nearly as many people attend the pre-show
<Silvermane> 15okay
<MirthTinker> 13B-But, you sought the comfort of another mare! I'M A HORRIBLE PARTNER!
<GRRM> I have a jacket like his
<SuperBrony64> Oh that pony
<SixSpeed> Nice.
<ValtheJean> so we'd need to make it VERY clear when we do these artist spotlights
*herospirit absconds as quickly as possible to his safety corner
<SixSpeed> Double nice.
<mexican> more ponies!!
<DecapKing> 4oh god
<SixSpeed> Nuclear ponies?
<SuperBrony64> He might be off doing...something...not here
<MirthTinker> 13If, *sniff* if you really love her I'll go...
<Luna> 07Our newsletter needs work...
<Mason_Trowel> If I could draw at all, I would do it myself. Unfortunately, no dice.
<Luna> 07Ideas?
<MetalRainbowDash> His form says he's really good at singing.
<GrimGallop> (Surprised that churro thing isn't coming back up :P)
<VioletVanilla> 6POST ON ALLLL OF THE 4CHANS!
<Brevity> sounds like Fallout to me
<FreezeFrame> Green Bay doing that thing they did all last season
<Luna> 07lol
<VioletVanilla> 6:DD?
*Silvermane 15wonders why this RP gets so much more confusing when we aren't doing the canon event cycle
<MetalRainbowDash> Just go search for him.
<ValtheJean> what work does it need?
<FreezeFrame> Dominating.
<mexican> next ep is party of 1
<Luna> 07It needs love
<SixSpeed> RainbowDashWins, my friend's uncle is certified to weld on reactors.
*DecapKing 4struggles to keep control over the yellow pegasus
<VioletVanilla> 6It needs love
<Luna> 07lots of it
<SuperBrony64> Hey Churro thing is back up! Been a while.
<ReticentSmolder> 5sorry, Tink can get a little...melodramatic sometimes
<VioletVanilla> 6inb4 herdmind
<SuperBrony64> (:P)
<RainbowDashCancel> **** yes, Albert Wesker Pinkie Pie
<Fluttershy> -kicks DecapKing king in the stomach with her hind leg, flies to the bed and puts her front hooves on Silvermane 's neck-
<Luna> 07^<3
<ValtheJean> well the biggest problem is we don't have that much to advertise
<VioletVanilla> 6I have not seen this newsletter. ..
<ValtheJean> the more activities we plan, the more we can put in the newsletter
<SuperBrony64> (Clueless as to what that is...)
<Mason_Trowel> They should've given her his cateyes.
<MetalRainbowDash> Search
<SixSpeed> Fact!
<MetalRainbowDash> for Roberto!
<^Stargazer> complete... global... saturation......... of pony
<Luna> 07Well if you see the EQD post..
<SuperBrony64> Okay, I'm looking!
<DecapKing> 4fucking a.....

<mexican> party of one starting now:
<mexican> !link http://www.synchtube.com/r/IsaacShark#
<Silvermane> 15huh, impressive show of aggression.
<DerpyBot> Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
<Luna> 07the big line up is pretty much the newsletter
<Silvermane> 15now if only air flow was still available for me...
<Fluttershy> - puts her forehead against Silvermane 's and stares him hard in the eyes-
<Luna> 07http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/live-hub-stream-stress-test-from-brony.html?showComment=1315523502327#c8023772851248788118
<VioletVanilla> 6Ah, okay. . .
<mib_i7mhd6> Rainbow dash is best pony?
<GrimGallop> Perhaps you could just pull someone random out of the crowd to fill his slot in the show
<mib_i7mhd6> Screw this, I'm out.
<GRRM> hmmm
<Silvermane> 15oh dear
<RainbowDashCancel> "Oatmeal, are you crazy?"
<Silvermane> 15this just got worrisome
<GRRM> what about Garrett from the Thief series?
<ValtheJean> also, if you want I can start spending more time on the imaged signature
<RainbowDashCancel> "YOU MEAN NOTHING TO ME!"
<Luna> 07see what I mean?
<GRRM> has he been ponified?
<DecapKing> 4ah shit, i think that she broke a rib
<MetalRainbowDash> What if they're not good at singing
<RainbowDashCancel> *Maximum Pinkie*
<Luna> 07do it Val!
<MetalRainbowDash> We need
<MetalRainbowDash> a good singer.
<ValtheJean> right now it's just been a "whenever I have some free time"
<Silvermane> 15medkit in the cabinet
<GRRM> I know SHODAN has
<FreezeFrame> For anypony that follows American Football, Green Bay is doing what they did all last year
<ValtheJean> alright, I shall increase operations!
<Fluttershy> -stares even harder- "Grrrr...."
<MirthTinker> 13(just a tip Fluttershy, /me changes your text format, we use it sometimes for actions other than speaking like so:)
*Luna panics a little
<mexican> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<mexican> yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps mexican
<Luna> 07So much to do so little time
<FreezeFrame> Being utterly dominant on the field.
<MetalRainbowDash> Oh
<MetalRainbowDash> Here is Roberto.
*Octavia 13comforts Luna
<ValtheJean> haha
*DecapKing 4gets up
*MirthTinker 13walks to the corner of the room, sniffling quietly
<ValtheJean> well, I'm always up for more work
<Efreet> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/art/src/131522301669.png I've been ponified ;D
<VioletVanilla> 6It will be okay Luna~
<DecapKing> 4its going to take more than just that to stop me
<Keyframe> i'm looking at all of my favorite flash animators on youtube.... And this whole time I've never been more proud of them.
<MetalRainbowDash> *After Roberto's performance*
<Synros> ok back, I think I eat to much delicious bacon
<RainbowDashCancel> Now all we need is Applejack kicking a giant boulder
*Luna is a perfectionist
<GrimGallop> o.o
*Octavia 13is too
*VioletVanilla is three
*DecapKing 4picks the yellow pegasus up of of Silvermane
<Octavia> 13We just need to work hard!
<ValtheJean> agreed
<SuperBrony64> Rainbow Dash, I couldn't find Robert--Oh, I guess you found him already...
*Silvermane 15shifts, quite nervous now. "Tink, Fluttershy, please relax a moment."
<MetalRainbowDash> (Synros, we're chat roleplaying in Ponyville)
<VioletVanilla> 6I can try helping out. . . x.x
<Mason_Trowel> Lol, nice, Efreet.
<DecapKing> 4please, this is really hard to do
<Luna> 07YES you can!
<Synros> where?
*Fluttershy freezes, then kicks DecapKing, escaping back to land on Silvermane and then... kisses him hard.
<Luna> 07Wait where... did that come from...
<Spin> Favorite Pinkie quote: Yes and Grudge Rhymes with fudge. And I like fudge, but if I eat too much fudge Il get a pudge and I can't budge
<MetalRainbowDash> (In this chat room)
<Luna> 07Obama....
