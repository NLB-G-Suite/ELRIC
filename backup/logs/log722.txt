<Alchemist> Phase4: I plan to vote for this as the next B movie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylzO9vbEpPg do you think its eligible or should I bother someone else with this question?
<Vivix> we should have an all david lynch movie night
<Vivix> but none of his movies were ever A
<Alchemist> did he make dune?
<Vivix> hm..
<Vivix> I don't thnk so, maybe
<Alchemist> Because I think it counts as a movie
<Alchemist> I mean an A movie
<Vivix> yeah he was in on Dune
<Vivix> He was actually up for 8 oscars with The Elephant Man
<Phase4> 00,02Alchemist, uh.... wierd looking movie
<Vivix> Huh, he made a music video for X Japan
<Vivix> who'da thunk it
<Phase4> 00,02its rated quite high
<Alchemist> Phase4: its a cannes film festival winner I think
<Phase4> 00,0291 on metacritic, 7.9 on imdb
<Saturn> 08,01we talkin' aboot david lynch?
<Vivix> He was mentioned, yeah
<Saturn> 08,01i actually really like his Dune movie
<Phase4> 00,0296 on rotten tomato
<Phase4> 00,02so i think it counts as A
<Vivix> It's a really very long time since I've seen Dune
<Saturn> 08,01that's the thing though, we've not really had a perfect interpretation of Dune at all yet
<Alchemist> Phase4: thanks, I will vote for it as an A movie then
<Saturn> 08,01Lynch's movie had it's flaws, but it had great production values
<Vivix> I can barely remember anything- so I can't say my opinion on it, but it seems to have had a good reception
<Saturn> 08,01the Dune miniseries was book-accurate, but was terribly shot and acted
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4, doesn't the foreign factor count?
<Saturn> 08,01so somewhere between the two lies perfection
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love the style though
<Phase4> 00,02CrimsonPhoenix, don't see why it should
<Vivix> I do remember trying to read the books, maybe I should do that again.
<Jmo> Try reading a book and I'll hit you with it.
<Vivix> I do like some of lynch's stuff, and I like some of the ideas- but like Twin Peaks fire walk with me? Did not like it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Jmo what?
*Vivix hits Jmo with book-heart
*Gold_Demona tries reading a book

<infernap12> i rearranged my monitors https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53776618/2012-11-04%2014.01.32.jpg
<alexxm> hey zackthebrony are you from long island
<Vivix> Some here don't when they say that
<Jmo> ew
<Jmo> That's rubbish infernap12
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vivix, I'm the JOker
<Jmo> Who the hell stacks monitors
<zackthebrony> no, from a little place called MARYLAND!
<CrimsonPhoenix> I want to put a smile on your face
<infernap12> imagine it with 4 more
<zackthebrony> MARYLAND YEAH
<infernap12> 2 on each side
<Vivix> But joker hurts when he makes you smile-
<CrimsonPhoenix> zackthebrony, who's Alex Kidd?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vivix, that's the thing
<zackthebrony> ? what crimson
<zackthebrony> I don't know who the "Alex Kidd" os
<CrimsonPhoenix> zackthebrony, Alex Kidd is one of Sega's mascot
<zackthebrony> *is
<zackthebrony> oh
<zackthebrony> god damn I need to get with the program XD
*Vivix is not a retrogamer
<CrimsonPhoenix> indeed
<CrimsonPhoenix> how old are you?
<Vivix> I had a sega, and I think I played sonic, but I can't remember
<zackthebrony> who me?
<CrimsonPhoenix> you can answer in PM if you wish
<CrimsonPhoenix> yes you
<zackthebrony> oh i'm ten
<zackthebrony> I write fan fic
<CrimsonPhoenix> .....
<zackthebrony> I watch the show
<CrimsonPhoenix> ten
<zackthebrony> hell yeah
<zackthebrony> but i'm a true brony
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's......wow
<zackthebrony> AND I CAN PROVE IT
<Gold_Demona> ?
<Vivix> We've had other people here that young
<Vivix> can't remember their names
<CrimsonPhoenix> no wonder you don't know about G4 and prior
<zackthebrony> I know about G4
<zackthebrony> that's the one I watch
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's like Retro for you is Gamecube
<zackthebrony> no I do SNES
<CrimsonPhoenix> OOOOOOOH
<Vivix> Retro is a hipster thing, so retro is 1989-1999
<CrimsonPhoenix> parents kept it?
<zackthebrony> no, emulator...
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh....
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's.....a shame
<zackthebrony> I wish I had a real one though
<Gold_Demona> That doesn't count. :P
<infernap12> how can you even comprehend the complex working of pony sociology and the intricate relationships between the mane six
<MLP_Brovakiin> I played the shit out of my SNES :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> nothing is better than the true console itself
<zackthebrony> But I have an SNES controller that I plug in
<Gold_Demona> I still have my SNES
<zackthebrony> true Crimson, so true
<zackthebrony> LUCKY
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/IPCa5.gif
<Vivix> You can still buy them
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't have an SNES as well but I did have a Genesis
<Gold_Demona> ebay
<Vivix> I think they cost around..3-400 dollars in Norway
<zackthebrony> WHAT WAS THAT BRONYSITH XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> as well as an Atari
<Vivix> refurbished of course
<CrimsonPhoenix> and THAT BRICK called NES
<MLP_Brovakiin> I think my mum got rid of my SNES as she is a horrible human being...
<zackthebrony> yeah...
<Gold_Demona> I used to have a Genesis, but I left it with my mom and sister when I moved out.
<infernap12> well, its getting late, night everyone
<zackthebrony> who is best out of the mane six?
<MLP_Brovakiin> and my nintendo 64 :c
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye infernap12 :)
<Frenchy_pony> I bought an atari 1year ago for 20$
<Bronysith> zackthebrony: applejack
<CrimsonPhoenix> zackthebrony, Rarity of course
<zackthebrony> Rainbow Dash
<Vivix> My sister threw the n64 at the wall
<zackthebrony> in my opinion
<Gold_Demona> zackthebrony: Pinkie
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh lawl
<zackthebrony> damn we all have different opinions XD
<Bronysith> hey Gold_Demona how are you today sister?
<CrimsonPhoenix> we only need Twilight and Fluttershy
<MLP_Brovakiin> it is all down to personal preference :3
<zackthebrony> I thought at least 2 people would agree with someone else
<zackthebrony> that's so true bro
<MLP_Brovakiin> But I like AJ :3
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Doing alright. Just hangin' out and stuff.
<zackthebrony> yeah, AJ's my second favorite
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: yay
<Bronysith> Twilight is my fav pony
<Vivix> Top 3 here is Fshy, PP and Rarity
<Bronysith> and applejack is her best friend
<Bronysith> DONT FUCKING DENY IT
<MLP_Brovakiin> :D
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: technically, yes she is
<Vivix> She is?
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, and so are the other four. :D
<Vivix> I never looked for their internal connections- maybe I should
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352041018010.jpg my reaction to Season 3
<Gold_Demona> They're ALL her very best friends. Don't you listen to the intro?
<Vivix> Of course!
*Vivix self slap
<Vivix> I wonder, though, who she hangs out the most with
<Bronysith> but APplejack cause Applejack actually apologized to twilight
<MLP_Brovakiin> Vivix: Steven magnet :3
<Vivix> Steven Magnet and Twilight are the bestest of friends
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<Vivix> cuz dey purple yo
<MLP_Brovakiin> true facts :3
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: yet still, it might JUST MIGHT be intended that the rest appologized before the RECEPTION.............just saying MIGHT
<Gold_Demona> And Spike
<Gold_Demona> Cuz Spike is also purple
<Bronysith> Dark92Enigma: nope
<Vivix> might
<Bronysith> spike is a slave
<Vivix> The purple gang
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: lol.....we'll see when he gets his next focus episode
<Bronysith> Applejack needs her own episode
<Bronysith> and song
<Bronysith> considering she only had 1 episode
<Vivix> That is well established
<MLP_Brovakiin> derpy stole her last episode :P
<Vivix> not just Derpy
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: and then you say: she'll never have it''
<Vivix> the others of the M6 was more in focus than she was
<Bronysith> Dark92Enigma: cause she wont
<Vivix> were*
<MLP_Brovakiin> true
<SpeccyRush> just like Scootaloo
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: not in the short term.....
<flutter_spin> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 5 days, 23 hours, 55 minutes, 30 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352000824072.png I LOVE YOU TARA
<Dark92Enigma> i have a feeling....that season 3 will have a story-arc
<Bronysith> i have a feeling season 3 will suck
<flutter_spin> lol Bronysith
<Vivix> Maybe, there's been a minor arc in the others
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: don't we all love her?
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Don't jinx it. :<
<Vivix> I'm not crazy about any of the VA's, but I like their work, don't know any of their personalities
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: i have a feeling you will be a TROLOLOLOLOLO until S3 premiers
<Bronysith> um, no
<Dark92Enigma> ok
<Bronysith> cause season 3 is going to be disapointing
<flutter_spin> Either they will A) Go downhill like Spongebob B) Give us what we want C) Squeeze in new stories that don't make sense
<SpeccyRush> I have a feeling Bronysith will feel a feel http://i.imgur.com/h7SFV.jpg
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, if you hype it up too much yes
<Bronysith> im not hyping it up
<Vivix> Bronysith want's it to be a disappointment, because then his worldview is correct
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: then you will be a TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO until S3 ends
*Dark92Enigma cue the song
<Vivix> There will be disappointed people, beacuse it's no longer new, but- most people won't be, I sure as hay won't be
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352025615240.jpg
<Vivix> I think S2 was leaps and bounds over S1 in quality
<Dark92Enigma> OK, tbh there WILL be a time when the show loses popularity
<Vivix> Of course, that's natural
<zackthebrony> Bronysith, your link made me so jealous
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, there will be a time when the show get's cancelled
<Vivix> but- I really couldn't care less about the popularity of the show, as long as it has a steady income and get's to run itself out
<CrimsonPhoenix> people are still surprised by that fact
<Bronysith> season 1 had the highest quality
<Vivix> I disagree
<Dark92Enigma> i mean look at Spongebob, PPG and Rugrats
<The_Engineer> Hi evedrybody :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> hai The_Engineer
<flutter_spin> I really can't tell. When it comes down to it, Season 1 nearly equals Season 2
<zackthebrony> HERROW
<zackthebrony> HERROW ENGINEER
<zackthebrony> YOU FIX CAR FOR ME?
<Vivix> Everything ends sometime, but it's not something you sit around and think abot in my opinion
<zackthebrony> YES, YOU FIX CAR
<Vivix> S1 is good, really good, but I think s2 is better, don't know what S3 will be yet
*MLP_Brovakiin face hooves
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352003079677.png
<flutter_spin> I think Season 2 had a lot more 'entertaining' episodes while season 1 had a lot of character development/morals
<Bronysith> season 1 is far surperior to season 2
<Vivix> Not really
<BaconMane> 0,5I prefer Season 2
<Vivix> but yeah S1 had more moral lessons
<BaconMane> 0,5For it is superior
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: i ......try not to think about it. :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, I'm sorry but you need too
<Vivix> I also think S2 upped the quality of direction and animation
<Vivix> production value
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352022368437.jpg
<CrimsonPhoenix> You need to prepare your spirit so you won't get depressed by one show
<flutter_spin> That spin during Putting Your Hoof Down freaked me out!
<Vivix> ^^
<Dark92Enigma> Season 1 has it's epic moments, but Season 2 improved in animation and in pay-off
<Vivix> And no, we don't need to prepare for anything, things end when they end and we deal with it then
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: i guess you're right
<The_Engineer> I'm gonna go stream now. But regulary no one watches me stream and sometimes I don't.
<Vivix> Yeah, I loved s1, without it, I wouldn't be a fan of the show, but I do think s2 was an improvement
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, also there will be other show you could jump into and love
<flutter_spin> Definitely was improvement. I think there was improvement even throughout the first season
<Vivix> Totally
<CrimsonPhoenix> season 1 was something new fresh
<Alchemist> dunno, S2 was certainly better aesthetically, but it got kinda stale in character building.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's why people like it
<Vivix> as seasons progress it will stop being fresh
<Nabronyan> Hey guys, i'm back
<Vivix> that's an issue the simpsons got hammered with in s4
<BaconMane> 0,5I actually got into ponies a couple months before S2 began
<Nabronyan> If anyone remembers me, that is :o
<Vivix> people started to say "I hate this season, this sucks" but after four years they said "I loved s4 but I hate this new season"
<Vivix> it's--just how it is
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back Nabronyan
<BaconMane> 0,5So I was able to go through season 1, wait a little while, and then go into S2 :P
<flutter_spin> Alchemist: I think the problem was that some episodes was just so jam-packed with references and fun, that afterwards they felt a little hollow.. as if you didn't connect with the characters
<Vivix> I got into ponies a few episodes into s2
<zackthebrony> I wanna go play a game
<zackthebrony> so now i'm gonna play
<zackthebrony> DDC3
<Gold_Demona> It was the same for me BaconMane
<Dark92Enigma> anyway, i bet you guys
<flutter_spin> zackthebrony: play mechwarrior online :P
<Gold_Demona> I started watching just a couple monthsw before S2 started.
<Nabronyan> Is anything streaming? Also, what are you guys talking about? :l
<Vivix> There wasn't as much dev I guess, the characters were established, but I did see some wonderful changes in character throoughout season 2
<Gold_Demona> months*
<alexxm> same here BaconMane i got into he show about a month before season 2 and
<flutter_spin> Nabronyan: discussing how we feel about season 3 when relating seasons 1 & 2
<The_Engineer> Its almost time for S3
<SpeccyRush> I got into ponies a week before Luna Eclisped, can you guess my favorite pony
<The_Engineer> 6 days
<The_Engineer> Luna
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: which?
<flutter_spin> SpeccyRush: lol. Same as I
<The_Engineer> I got into ponies months ago
<Alchemist> flutter_spin: that wasnt really the case for me. Its just that the characters became a bit inconsistent and flavorless. They still have some pretty damn good moments, but I dont feel much progression or complexity.
<Gold_Demona> SpeccyRush: Granny Smith >_>
<Vivix> I can not remember the first live episode I saw
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352010793226.gif
<Nabronyan> Hay bronysith
<MadSurge> I got in a little later, started watching the week when The Cutie Pox aired, and my first "waiting" episode was May The Best Pet Win
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, I cannot predict the future but clearly there will be other shows
<Bronysith> hi Nabronyan
<Dark92Enigma> welcome back Nabronyan !
<SpeccyRush> Gold_Demona: no but same VA
<Vivix> I didn't get that feeling Alchemist, but- different people notice different things I suppose
<Gold_Demona> SpeccyRush: I was joking. :P
<Alchemist> flutter_spin: and dont get me wrong, I think its still a pretty good show.
<flutter_spin> Alchemist: Personality shifts. Definitely.
<MadSurge> But my first live episode was Read It And Weep
<SpeccyRush> Gold_Demona: iknow "P
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: true.....there is ALWAYS a reason to watch TV
<flutter_spin> oh yeah, for sure
<Dark92Enigma> my first live episode was MMMMMMMMMystery on the friendship express
<Vivix> I don't watch TV, other than MLP really-
<MadSurge> Anyone remember when The Cutie Pox aired?
<Alchemist> I dont even have a TV...
<Dark92Enigma> i tried to watch Ponyville confindential but failed
<flutter_spin> I love Fluttershy, so Dragonshy will always be one of my favorite episodes.
<MadSurge> ^
<The_Engineer> Fluttershy is PONI
<Vivix> I thiink..my first live episode waas..Cutie Pox or May the best pet win
*Nittany_Discord 11,01glomps Bronysith
*Bronysith glomps Nittany_Discord back
<Dark92Enigma> .....anyway i bet you guys that the two-parter WILL have SEVERAL Sailor Moon references
<Vivix> Cutie Pox was my first
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: hello aniki
<Dark92Enigma> hi Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hey there.
<Vivix> Cutie Pox aired-- 2011 10 22
<flutter_spin> And I really connected to Rarity during Sisterhooves Social. Another fav for me.
<Vivix> I loved that episode
<Dark92Enigma> but my first episode was ''May The Best Pet Win''
<Dark92Enigma> then i got into the PILOT
<Vivix> the first episode i SAW was episode 1 season 1
<Vivix> but first live I saw was Cutie Pox
<flutter_spin> good o' pilot. I remember watching it and I think I instantly loved it with Twilight's personality
<Vivix> Twilight took a while for me <,<
<Vivix> I didn't dislike her, but I didn't love her
<Bronysith> twilight is best pony
<Alchemist> I dont even know if I have a favorite character. I just cant settle for one, but on derpibooru on my upvoted list AJ has the most pictures.
<flutter_spin> I will always say Twilight is best pony, Fluttershy is my favorite pony.
<Vivix> I love them all, but I think Fshy and Rarity- Pinkie are the ones I love the most
<flutter_spin> Pinkie I will always adore, but she reminds me of my step-sister
<Vivix> I think Baby Cakes was a great episode for Pinkie-
<Loopy_Legend> HEy guys.
<MadSurge> Vivix: well of course :D
<Vivix> she's not always crazy and hyper, she gets tired and responsible too
<Alchemist> Actually the characters always do/show something that keeps changing my position towards them.
<flutter_spin> lol. Baby Cakes was great.
<Loopy_Legend> Anyone seen SuperBrony?
<Dark92Enigma> IN FACT, before watching a FULL episode (May the Best Pet win) someone at high school showed me part 2 of S2 premiere......there's when i started to get interested BEFORE watching a full one.......
<MadSurge> Ohay Loopy_Legend
<BaconMane> 0,5I enjoyed the episode with daring do
<Vivix> Daring Do was grreaat episode
*Dark92Enigma i said : I might...........might GIVE THIS SHOW A CHANCE
<alexxm> how are things Loopy_Legend
<Dark92Enigma> look at me now
<flutter_spin> Daring Do was fun. I think I rated it like 20 on my list.
<MadSurge> BaconMane: you mean Luna Eclipsed? :D
<Loopy_Legend> Good thanks mate.
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8126/
<BaconMane> 0,5I liked when Dashie was bored and she was bouncing the ball against the wall and clicking the lamp to stay entertained
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Read it and Weep.
<BaconMane> 0,5MadSurge: No
<BaconMane> 0,5:I
<Vivix> ANything to avoid reading
<Jmo> Huh an Australia
<Loopy_Legend> Australian :D
<Jmo> Vic or NSW?
<flutter_spin> Anyone check out the Trotmania?
<Loopy_Legend> Niether :P
<Jmo> NT?
<Loopy_Legend> Cane toad all the way.
<MadSurge> Loopy_Legend: there's other australians here :)
<Loopy_Legend> I know.
<BaconMane> 0,5Luna Eclipsed was alriight, but it flow like i thought it would
<Jmo> Amazing, an Australia who isn't from Vic or NSW.
<Jmo> Australian, I dunno how to spell tonight.
<Jmo> Vivix I blame you.
<Vivix> I liked Luna Ecplised, but it is one I rarely rewatch-
*Vivix strokes Jmo's tongue
<Jmo> wat.
<Vivix> noow you'll type better
<alexxm> BaconMane i like how that segment in daringn doo was in real time as well
<flutter_spin> I definitely connected with Luna. I think they played her character great.
<BaconMane> 0,5I just feel like it was a sudden wierd thing
<Loopy_Legend> Dang SuperBrony asleep, great just when I need him.
<Dark92Enigma> brb, gotta go shopping
<Vivix> In Luna Eclipsed, I didn't quite like how--she had to change to be liked? Had to tone down her authority
<The_Engineer> I hate luna(not a lot but you know a little) Because she never comes in the show a lot except for the halloween one
<Vivix> but only so much you can do in 22 minutes
<Loopy_Legend> And he was the one chasing me, suppose different time zones a real killer.
<flutter_spin> But there was that big gap in backstory between Princess Luna breaking out of Nightmare Moon and... you know, "hello where have you been"
<Vivix> We probably will never know a lot about hte prinesses
<Vivix> but- that can be kinda nice
<MadSurge> BaconMane: so far I don't really dislike any pony episodes. The two I like the least are just boring
<Vivix> I don't downright dislike any episodes, but there are ones I skip when rewatching
<Alchemist> Vivix: I am kinda hoping they would add more lore in S3
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5698/
<Vivix> I love the lore episodes
<flutter_spin> lol MadSurge. Well of course your worst episodes are going to be boring
<Vivix> Hearth's warming eve is actually one of my top 10 in s2 I think
<The_Engineer> Well since I'm done eating I'm streaming(all my streams will never be watched because know one would know my livestream and ever see it)
<MadSurge> flutter_spin: yes, but I don't go "OMG WORST EPSIOD EVAARRRR :[ "
<The_Engineer> Lol
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5492/
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0TqVaEMlgI
<MadSurge> Bronysith: go search for spiderjack too
<The_Engineer> THAT TWILIGHT IS A SPY!
<The_Engineer> Crab
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5008/
<Bronysith> shut up The_Engineer
<Alchemist> MadSurge: speaking of which, why was the mysterious mare do well so hated by many? Its like it was so obviously bad. did i miss something?
<The_Engineer> Nou
<flutter_spin> I still can't believe a Vinyl Fluttershy is coming out. Instant buy for me.
<Vivix> It wasn't hated, it was just--nothing happened in that episode
<The_Engineer> A vinyl fluttershy
<Vivix> and RD was a bit more of a bitch than usual
<The_Engineer> The heck?
<Jmo> Soap.
<The_Engineer> Bitcherdash
<flutter_spin> The_Engineer: you know the vinyl Rainbow Dash & Derpy?
<Vivix> I liked the episode, but I understood what they ment in the after-episode review
*Vivix eats soap
<The_Engineer> What O.o
<MadSurge> Alchemist: because everyone was out of character apparently
<Vivix> I don't think they were
<Vivix> but it was -- some people hate it, other love it
<Alchemist> me neither, maybe RD's character was a bit exaggerated but thats it.
<Vivix> I think the people said 8/10 after initial air
<flutter_spin> http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/PopCulture/MyLittlePony//My+Little+Pony+Rainbow+Dash+Vinyl+Figure-144781.jsp
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352042470015.jpg
<Vivix> Yeah, a bit exaggerated RD, but--we got to learn about her
<Vivix> but yeah it is a kind of empty episode, so not everyone liked it
<MadSurge> Alchemist: it WAS driven by gags, mostly, but I didn't think it was that bad! Also, Batman music and Darkwing Duck hat :$
<The_Engineer> Rdash vinyl?
<flutter_spin> yep
<The_Engineer> What...
<Vivix> yeah, they eh
<Vivix> it was packed with references
<The_Engineer> I don't get it it kinda looks like the norm one
<Vivix> it was more like a comedy episode than an mlp episode, so I guess that plays in too
<Vordox> LET THE INTERNET BEGIN!

<CrimsonPhoenix> HAMSTER DANCE
<MadSurge> Vivix: My least fav s2 episode was the Flim Flam one :I one song is not enough to drive an episode
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH MY GOD
<flutter_spin> The vinyl is a LOT BIGGER than I anticipated
<Vivix> Really? I really liked that one- even if I think Flim and Flam was a bit unfairly treated, but they WERE conning-
<flutter_spin> lol FlimFlam song... so. freakin'. long.
<Vivix> I looved that song though-
<The_Engineer> Dont get it
<Vivix> Dragon Quest is probably my least in s2-
<Vivix> proobably
<flutter_spin> Vivix: I just remember the chat at about the 4min marker. "LONGEST SONG EVER"
<Vivix> Hehe yeah, it was LONG
<Vivix> and suddenly, ads
<flutter_spin> I gotta' go.
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2689/
<Vivix> We were like "Wait, that's half the episode!"
<CrimsonPhoenix> flim flam is glorious for the talent of the singer
<CrimsonPhoenix> SERIOUSLY
<CrimsonPhoenix> Flim flam song is HARD to sing
<Vivix> They were grreaat singers
<Gold_Demona> It was ONE singer? O_o
<Vivix> it has a really good showtune feel to it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gold_Demona, it was two
<CrimsonPhoenix> but still
<MadSurge> Vivix: don't blame you. I did like though they brought up the issue of Spike's origins, maybe we can expect more about that this season :3
<Vivix> Yeah, I like that angle of it
<Gold_Demona> I love the Flim Flam song. It's one of my favorites
<The_Engineer> Bronysith you're just posting pics....Are you gonna talk here or put in random pics at random moments?
<Vivix> but I didn't like the teenage-dragons- I thought it was a bit too outlandish
<alexxm> test
<Bronysith> The_Engineer: and you're an asshole ^_^
<Vivix> but- I enjoyed watching it the first time, but I do tend to skip it
<CrimsonPhoenix> The_Engineer, that's his job
<flutter_spin> Drunk FlimFlam singer > all
<The_Engineer> How am I a asshole?
<Vivix> Bronysith you're usually the only asshole here at this hour
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the song is fine, it's the rest of the episode that is kinda eeeehhh
<The_Engineer> I have one but ain't one
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2234/
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, you're starting to be one
<alexxm> eh i guess it helped with world buliding Vivix
<Vivix> yeah-
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2224/
<CrimsonPhoenix> but yeah The_Engineer Bronysith does that most of the time
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2118/
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: That's kinda how I feel about the one with Cranky Doodle Donkey. I LOVE the smile song, but the rest of the episode I can do without.
<The_Engineer> Now hes just repeatedly attempting to spam?
<Malmortius> is stream on
<The_Engineer> No stream.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<Gold_Demona> As much as I love Pinkie, she was just WAY too clueless in that episode.
<The_Engineer> I know
<Vivix> Cranky Doodle-
<The_Engineer> Those were the break up episodes
<Vivix> Yeah I get what you mean about that one
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1860/
<The_Engineer> Or something related to that
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1862/
<Vivix> I love Pinkie Pie, so --she was a bit too blank there yeah- that song was great
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: let's hope for a Pinkie episode that blows them all out of the water :$
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Indeed. :3
<Vivix> Aw heall yeah
<Gold_Demona> I'd like a Pinkie-centered episode where she's not a complete bimbo.
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1651/
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: at least we got the Smile song :$
<Vivix> Hehe Gold_Demona me too
<The_Engineer> MadSurge: Pinkie blow who out of the water?
<Vivix> I think she was good in Baby Cakes
<MadSurge> ^
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: How true that is
<Vivix> in MMMystery I liked how she got annoyed, and not just super happy all the time
<The_Engineer> Yea that ep was awesome
<The_Engineer> Then poor pinkie....cryed...:'(
<Vivix> yeah that and
<Vivix> when Twilight took her hat?
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1324/
<MadSurge> Vivix: yeah, annoyed Pinkie is still funny :D
<Vivix> she was like >:( for an instant
<Vivix> it was nice to see her have emotions and reactions like that
<Vivix> Yeaah she was fun in that

<Bronysith> zackthebrony: shut up

<StinkomanFan> Isn't that illegal~?
<cowvarkian> StinkomanFan: no

<Hermaeus_Bacon> 0,5If you give away someone's address, you're going to pay.
<Rainboom> Hermaeus_Bacon: I'll pay ya two bits
<Vordox> Hermaeus_Bacon: I know that, But I would not give the adress publically.
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: while i admire the spirit, it borders on harassment, which is against channel rules
<zackthebrony> anypony wanna here a cool story?
<pot80_GLaDos> MLP_Brovakiin and thelonepony ok considering I just read my little dashie XD thanks
<Saturn> 08,01zackthebrony: go on

<Vordox> StinkomanFan: If you didn't notice what they both said =P
<Vordox> But the internet is NOT a plaything
<cowvarkian> Vordox: sure it is
<Vordox> But so many people are looking it as it is such.
<thelonepony> pot80_GLaDos: :D
<Rainboom> Once there was an ugly barnacle he was SO ugly that everyone died! the end c:

<zackthebrony> @Saturn: Once there was a guy named issac newtan and he sat below an appletree. Applejack bucked an apple on his head, and he died and AJ Went to prison. Issac went to heaven and learned two things, 1. Ponies like to kill 2. apples hurt
<Vivix> Only reason to fear the internet is if you're doing something you're not supposed to, or something that you be difficult in a job setting

<StinkomanFan> HA, I hardly even know my own home adress. All I've left was the School I go to and the town I live in, and even then it'll take you days, weeks, even years to find the precise location
<cowvarkian> Saturn: the end
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: ...
<Vordox> LAWL NO
<Bronysith> pot80_GLaDos: still overrated, not as sad as everyone makes it out to be TBH

<StinkomanFan> Especially since I live outside of town. :)
<Vivix> DHL couldn't find my house, then I moved
<Vivix> If anyone TRIES, they will probably find anything they need
<Vivix> but--so what?
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: Doesn't change much really. =P
<Rainboom> It's a good thing whenever someone says something on the chat it doesnt make some kind of noise because on November 10th that would be very annoying

<Gold_Demona> lol
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/864/
<pot80_GLaDos> one word and I spelt it wrong -_-
<MLP_Brovakiin> :D
<Bronysith> my god that was an excellent pot of tea
<StinkomanFan> I understand Vordox that A. I have a papertrail miles long and B. Anypony who hates me can use it to troll me
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5107/
<Vivix> And that is nothing new for anyone anywhere
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: And that's not power?
<JRP2234> NewSuperBronyU|Zzz get up
<StinkomanFan> But the thing is, everypony who hates me are either to stupid or too lazy to actually use it against me
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7799/
<thelonepony> JRP2234: dont ping SB when hes catching the Z's
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3850/
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: I'm not one of those. :P
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: But to be honest...
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: You've done ALOT of works on wikis, that's something I can admire. XD
<StinkomanFan> But you don't hate me :)
<StinkomanFan> Thank you Vordox
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4772/
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: I don't hate you, I'm just trying to make you a point
<Vordox> Even if I do not know you, well outside of this, doesn't mean I have no power over you
<Vordox> It just requires competance. :P
<Bronysith> Vordox: words are power
<Vivix> Power is what value you give to something
<pot80_GLaDos> Bronysith: thats one hell of a derail :D
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5548/
<Vordox> Bronysith: Wrong, actions are.
<Bronysith> pot80_GLaDos: ive seen more epic derailings
<Vordox> Words are empty shells, if anything
<Bronysith> Vordox: still doesnt mean they cant hurt
<StinkomanFan> Competence is just like common sense. An ability so rare it may as well be a superpower
<Vivix> Words instigate action, depending on the value you give to either, either can be power
<Rainboom> dumb computer
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: XD and well, I can dig even deeper for you, going to take some time though :P
<Vordox> Vivix: So President is power? X
<Vordox> Vivix: Say these words, do something other.
*Vivix shrugs
<Vordox> Actions, to me personally, > Words by any means
<Vivix> to you personally, yes
<Vivix> that's what I'm saying, power is something you assign to something
<Gold_Demona> You'd be amazed how far a well-used word can go.
<Gold_Demona> Or even a not-so-well-used one
<Vivix> there's ACTUAL power, actions are actual power, but that power can be set by words
<Gold_Demona> ^
<StinkomanFan> You have made your point Vordox. I shall wait for your mailed picture of a pony mocking me in a few weeks
<pot80_GLaDos> technically speaking the use of words is an action in itself
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: I'll keep that in mind ;)
<JRP2234> chrome drives your ram up your ass if you leave it running with to many tabs open for a while
<Vivix> So, yeah- internet is powerful, and as we've seen with some poor authors of pony-smut, it can make their professional lives hell if they're not careful
<StinkomanFan> Make sure it's a colored envelope so my parents aren't suspicious :)
<Vivix> but for average joe, internet is nothing powerful
<Rainboom> double rainboom all the way
<Rainboom> across the skkkyy
<pot80_GLaDos> you forgot sonic
<StinkomanFan> inb4 Sonic Hate
<Rainboom> sonic rainboom all the way across the skkyy
<Rainboom> yea yea yeaaa so intense
<pot80_GLaDos> thats better :D
<Vivix> If anoyne ever sees a tripple rainbow
<Vivix> their hearts will melt
<Rainboom> I saw a triple rainbow b4
<Vivix> Did your heart melt? D=
<Rainboom> Yeah and then I had to get a new one at the hospital :D

*Vordox is getting VERY close to where StinkomanFan's home is, takes out a envelope.
*GummyRainboom to get hit by a car because it hated itself ; - ;
<Bronysith> pot80_GLaDos: cause i killed its mother
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/348/

<RDash5000> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7772/
<Bacon[Hazard]> What's up?
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone find Fluttershy to be creepy?
<cachi01> me
<cachi01> those giant eye...
<cachi01> eyes*
<Bacon[Hazard]> Sometimes, it's just a matter of what you read and see. From what I've seen a read, though, I would probably run away screaming like a little girl.
<APPLEBLOOM111> I find Pinkie Pie to be creepy
<APPLEBLOOM111> sometimes
<Bacon[Hazard]> The Fiction That Shalt Not Be Named made sure of that for me.
<cachi01> cupcakes?
<cachi01> sam?
<Bacon[Hazard]> SHHHHH!
<cachi01> my little dashie?
<APPLEBLOOM111> My favortie pony is either Applebloom, Applejack or Fluttershy.
<Bacon[Hazard]> You don't want to say it here. It's dangerous.
<cachi01> ok i wont say my little dashie
<DerpyMuffins> We all know Twilight is best pony
<Bacon[Hazard]> Luna is favorite and best pony.
<cachi01> STOP MISSPELLING PINKIE
<alexxm> rainbow dash is best pony
<Rainboom> Twilight is best pony -3-
<DerpyMuffins> Strange way to spell Twilight guys
<Bacon[Hazard]> 4chan defiled the name of Rainbow Dash.
<cachi01> RD is worst pony
<Rainboom> Derpy_Hooves: /)
<APPLEBLOOM111> Pinkie is creepy and sometimes annoying, Rarity is full of herself and Rainbow Dash is even more full of herself
<RDash5000> DerpyMuffins: fluttershy isn't creepy silly :) http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7542/
<DerpyMuffins> Tab fail
<DerpyMuffins> 138
<Rainboom> lol ik
<Blako> hi
<cachi01> APPLEBLOOM111: exactly
<JFFS> Hi everyone!
<Rainboom> DerpyMuffins: /)
<cachi01> APPLEBLOOM111: but i have to disagree with rarity and pinkie
<DerpyMuffins> (\
<thelonepony> Hi JFFS :)
<Rainboom> Twily is best pony
<cachi01> APPLEBLOOM111: pinkie just wants to make everyone smile and almost everything rarity does is for helping someone
<DerpyMuffins> Rarity helps her friends so she can help herself
<APPLEBLOOM111> Pinkie is not so much creepy but I still find her annoying SOMETIMES.
<Rainboom> Best Villian: Discord Best CMC: Sweetie Belle Best Princess: Luna Best mane6: Twilight Best bg pony: Derpy Best colt: Doctor Whooves
<Bacon[Hazard]> Rarity is a drama queen, Rainbow Dash is a hard head, Twilight has PSD, Applejack is Applejack, Fluttershy is too cute(not even sure if possible), and Pinkie has ADD, ADHD, and eats too much sugar.
<cachi01> discord is best CMC?
<Rainboom> no lol
<Bacon[Hazard]> You're welcome.
<cachi01> imo applejack is best background pony
<APPLEBLOOM111> http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/250x250/10816572.jpg
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<Bacon[Hazard]> Yes, indeed.
<StinkomanFan> http://blog.lesemajeste.org/.a/6a00e55195c7d28834011168458fd3970c-800wi Sequal to the popular "On the Internet Nobody Knows You are a Dog"
<Rainboom> AJ needs moar love
<APPLEBLOOM111> ^
<DerpyMuffins> AJ hasnt even had a song yet
<APPLEBLOOM111> ^
<DerpyMuffins> Twilight has like 8
<Bacon[Hazard]> Applejack sang in Winter Wrap Up. There is no excuse.
<cachi01> but its not HER song
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<Bacon[Hazard]> True, but she still sang.
<cachi01> background ponies cant have songs
<DerpyMuffins> Derpy got a song
<cachi01> way
<cachi01> wat?
<cachi01> she did?
<DerpyMuffins> Well fanmade ones
<Bacon[Hazard]> According to the Pony Participation Proclamation, ponies who sing in songs have their own song.
<DerpyMuffins> Derpy has more fanmade songs than AJ does
<APPLEBLOOM111> When Applejack finally got a S2 episode, Derpy stole the show. I don't not like derpy I'm just saying
<Bacon[Hazard]> Derp face, derp face I love you...
<cachi01> everypony sang in winter wrap up
<Rainboom> ur face is a skew
<Bacon[Hazard]> I can't remember the rest LD
<DerpyMuffins> Even when AJ got her own episode, Derpy stole the thunder
<Bacon[Hazard]> :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Derpy?
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH you mean Ditzy Doo
<Rainboom> derp face derp face I love you your eyes are all googly and your face is a skew!
<Vivix> That episode was mainly the other m6, so not just derpy
<APPLEBLOOM111> Derpytroll
<DerpyMuffins> I call her Derpy Ditzo Doo Hooves
<Bacon[Hazard]> That's not how you spell Derpy.
<Jmo> Askew.
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: both names are fine to me :)
<cachi01> ditzy....
<cachi01> nah
<JFFS> Is the endless stream buffering happening to everyone?
<cachi01> i'll stay with derpy
<DerpyMuffins> I fine with both
<Rainboom> Cung Foo
<cachi01> JFFS: we are watching the buffer show
<MadSurge> JFFS: everyone
<APPLEBLOOM111> Stupid parents
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, my headcanon name is Ditzy Derpy Doo Hooves the third
<cachi01> the third lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> because heck yeah royalty
<Rainboom> I want more party cannon in s3
<CrimsonPhoenix> She's the queen of the muffin kingdom
<BraveLittlePyro> Hey anyone know some good dubstep, my librarys sort of dry at the moment
<JFFS> terrific
<APPLEBLOOM111> I want more Gilda and Trixie in S3
<CrimsonPhoenix> BraveLittlePyro, none
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: :D I pretend her formal name is Ditzy Doo but friends call her Derpy Hooves :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> well that was easy
<cachi01> BraveLittlePyro: i dont think that exists
<Bacon[Hazard]> My headcanon is that Derpy Hooves had been sent to Equestria from the Moon to loosen the ponies up for an invasion by breaking their windows and eating all of their muffins.
<DerpyMuffins> Trixie has been confirmed in S3
<BraveLittlePyro> :\
<Rainboom> BraveLittlePyro: Ultimate Sweetie Belle :O
<BraveLittlePyro> Hm, k.
<Ryunosuke> needs more luna tbh :)
<Rainboom> Or Breaking a Sweat by Skrillex
<StinkomanFan> Headcanon: Secretly, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon have crushes on eachother.
<BraveLittlePyro> have thaty
<Bacon[Hazard]> I cannot wait until the next season. The new villain looks suckish, though.
<DerpyMuffins> Trixie needs to be Luna's protege
<RDash5000> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5683/

<BraveLittlePyro> Rainboom: Looking for songs like Sick Bubblegum if that narrows it down any more
<RDash5000> Rainboom: KFC

<StinkomanFan> brb, chat derped
<Bacon[Hazard]> Diamond Tiara attacks with 'Blank Flank!'. It isn't very affective...
<DerpyMuffins> No S3 discussions

<konsoln> oh my niock is changed
<RDash5000> sup konsoln
<cachi01> hi konsoln
<Rainboom> Looks like Diamond has an admirer now
<DerpyMuffins> 99.99% of Equestria is female
<Lil_B> thats better, hi everyone xD
<JFFS> hey konsoln
<Bacon[Hazard]> Love notes are canon. Notes are canon. Love is canon. Homosexuality is canon. Lesbians are canon.
<thelonepony> Hi Lil_B :)
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Lil_B
<Vivix> There's also some people who think that the sad pony down in right corner was trying to give her card to Twist
<DeadpoolDash|Zzz> everyone at that age gives everyone valentines
<Rainboom> TwistxTruffle Shuffle?
<Bacon[Hazard]> No!
<APPLEBLOOM111> ^
<Vivix> Not in thi scountry, we don't give them at all
<Lil_B> and thanks RDash5000 cachi01 JFFS thelonepony and DerpyMuffins :D
<Bacon[Hazard]> inb4 Equestria bans gay marriage. inb4 ponies do it anyway. inb4 half of the population is on the moon.
<DeadpoolDash|Zzz> well when I was in elementary school we pretty much gave the whole class valentine cards
<JFFS> oh, sorry Lil_B. Hi!
<Bacon[Hazard]> Seems legit.
<Saturn> 08,01how is homosexuality canon?
<cachi01> i find the valentine thing stupid
<APPLEBLOOM111> Not me :'(
<cachi01> oh hi Saturn :)
<Bacon[Hazard]> You obviously did not see the picture.
<Saturn> 08,01the picture?
<Bacon[Hazard]> Someone repost it.
<Bacon[Hazard]> I am too lazy.
<RDash5000> hugs http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5630/
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, I did bring up how stallion can be effeminate
<Lil_B> ok, I logged in via an other IRC because it said for me that Bronystate was down :/ ok changing back now
<cachi01> not that one
<CrimsonPhoenix> and we're talking about this picture http://i.imgur.com/WPtcH.png
<cachi01> Saturn: http://i.imgur.com/WPtcH.png
<DerpyMuffins> Stallions in Equestria are rare to say the least
<DerpyMuffins> Most of them are the royal guard
<cachi01> stallions are like 20% of equestria
<DerpyMuffins> More like 5%
<Bacon[Hazard]> Considering the ratio of female to male, I still don't see how there would still be homosexual males running around.
<Bacon[Hazard]> inb4 ten on one.
<CrimsonPhoenix> DerpyMuffins, I'm sorry but that's not true
<DerpyMuffins> 5% male ratio
<CrimsonPhoenix> nope
<CrimsonPhoenix> 5% is impossible
<Bacon[Hazard]> More like 15%.
<DerpyMuffins> 10% the most
<CrimsonPhoenix> 20% is appropriate
<Bacon[Hazard]> Because most of them are most likely living in the other cities.
<Rainboom> Do you like me? yes definetly ABSOLUTLY
<Bacon[Hazard]> I pick neither.
<Lil_B> I'd say 35 % male because many oif the BG Ponys are male
<APPLEBLOOM111> Gravity Falls?
<Rainboom> :3
<Vivix> 40%
<DerpyMuffins> Most stallions are Celestia's royal guard
<Rainboom> I RIGGED IT
<Vivix> there's no shortage of stallions or mares
<RDash5000> i hear faint noises in my headphones... i'm scared
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I'll go with Vivix
<DerpyMuffins> 35% the most
<APPLEBLOOM111> Where is your Celestia now?
<cachi01> just smile and wave boys. smile and wave http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7849/
<Lil_B> Vivix there's never not a shortage of mares
*Vivix brain break
<Bacon[Hazard]> inb4 a new episode comes up with most of the stallions are in cryogenic storage.
<RDash5000> cachi01: :D
<Vivix> look at how many stallions in guard, in Canterlot, in s2 backdrops for ponyville
<RDash5000> bye guys :)
<StinkomanFan> Back
<cachi01> inb4 Bacon[Hazard] got it right and he is banned for spoilers
<DerpyMuffins> Inb4 another unknown relative is reveled
<Bacon[Hazard]> inb4 Princess Celestia uses them to feed her immortality.
<Bacon[Hazard]> That actually makes a lot of sense... make this fiction. NOW.
<Bacon[Hazard]> *fan fiction*
*Vivix goes back to reading shipping
*cachi01 goes back to reading creepypasta
*Vivix always thought pasta was creepy
<Lil_B> DerpyMuffins of course, the evil tin of cadence, ! which was frozen... in time... because...
*Vivix thinks it looks like food, tastes like water
*thelonepony goes back to... stuff >_>
<Lil_B> twin*
<alexxm> chat derped
<StinkomanFan> Headcanon: Big MAc is secretly a superhero
*cachi01 thinks that pasta wants to kill him while he is asleep
<alexxm> do we have a stream
<thelonepony> no
<Lil_B> I do not think so
<DerpyMuffins> Inb4 Discord was Celestia's ex
<Vivix> Headcanon, BigMac is happy and alone.
<CrimsonPhoenix> WHEN WILL BACKGROUND PONY UPDATE
<CrimsonPhoenix> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH
<DerpyMuffins> Celestia stoned him because he dumped her
<Vivix> Actually my only gay headcanons, as in not for fun and shipping and fics, is Pokey, Cheerilee and Lyra/BonBon
<Bacon[Hazard]> DerpyMuffins: inb4 that was already made fan canon in a few places
<Vivix> It's quite an old fanon
<Bacon[Hazard]> Lyra/BonBon confirmed in S3?
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix I hoipe they'll include a Manticore soon, would spare me some work :/
<Vivix> Coldn't say if I knew
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, wat
<CrimsonPhoenix> what Manticore?
<StinkomanFan> Pretty sure Lyra/BonBon was confirmed in S2
<Vivix> confirmed as close friends yeah
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix the one from S1 E2 ?
<Bacon[Hazard]> "___ __" Pinkie said.
<DerpyMuffins> Inb4 Cadence was married before
<Vivix> but I like to think they're a couple
<Bacon[Hazard]> Guess what she said.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, what about him?
<CrimsonPhoenix> also guys about Lyra Bon bon http://www.fimfiction.net/story/26061/4/How-Every-Shipfic-Would-Actually-Happen/LyraBon
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix I hope they will include it in the next Backgroundpony update so I don't have to make one
<Bacon[Hazard]> Applejack?
<Vivix> 'realistic view'
<Vivix> and comedy
<CrimsonPhoenix> by they you mean he?
<Vivix> yeah won't read
<DerpyMuffins> I really wish they made DiscordXCelestia canon
<CrimsonPhoenix> and no please
<APPLEBLOOM111> clopfics REALLY scare me...
<cachi01> DerpyMuffins: no
<cachi01> just
<cachi01> no
<CrimsonPhoenix> why would he put a manticore when Luna is coming to town
<Vivix> I certainly don't want Discord Celestia, but if it happens it happens
<DerpyMuffins> Why else would Celestia stone him?
<cachi01> APPLEBLOOM111: clopfics are fun
<Vivix> Because he enslaved ponies for generations?
<Vivix> Watch S1 pilot and various other lore episodes
<Bacon[Hazard]> Part of me wishes they would make a new series as a parody of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic on Adultswim.
<Vivix> I don't like parodies, but I'm sure that would be a hit
<Lil_B> I could say something harmless about Clopficts but I think its better to not talk about this Stuff altogether here in the chat
<cachi01> Bacon[Hazard]: well MAD already made some cool parodies
<cachi01> and there is this R34 parody on the works.......
<APPLEBLOOM111> I read a clopfic of a human having sex with the CMC, a human having sex with Twilight, and one were Soarin fucked a pie.
<Bacon[Hazard]> They sucked. I mean big time, multi episode parodies.
<cachi01> APPLEBLOOM111: XDD equestrian pie is hilarious
<Lil_B> ...
<APPLEBLOOM111> yea that;s it
<Bacon[Hazard]> "That's one big ass pie!"
<CrimsonPhoenix> I would recommend you guys to drop this subject
<Lil_B> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> I've been warned for less so yeah
<cachi01> drop it
<StinkomanFan> Headcanon: Mr and Mrs Cake are the only ponies in Ponyville to have had sex in a long time
<APPLEBLOOM111> ok
<Viper> ]
<DerpyMuffins> You know what they say opposite attract
<APPLEBLOOM111> I guess that episode made sex canon...
<Bacon[Hazard]> >implying that the ponies ever had sex in the first place and are not all offspring of Celestia.
<DerpyMuffins> OrderXChaos
<cachi01> StinkomanFan: then explain THIS http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N1ji-9xoZtM/UCGB8VIjHqI/AAAAAAAAE8o/hRB01t7KCvQ/s1600/69170__.jpg

*Lil_B hugs NewSuperBronyU !
<cachi01> APPLEBLOOM111: well say that to hasbro!
<Vivix> CrimsonPhoenix, that it has, but it still may or may not related to s3, I honestly don't know and have avoided looking at it because of it
<Bacon[Hazard]> APPLEBLOOM111: Diabetes.
<Lil_B> I have tzo check the Mikrowave, I just warmed up an old Meme
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vivix, I personally don't think it will
<Vivix> I hope not-
<StinkomanFan> Headcanon: the CMC are members of the Kids Next Door
<Vivix> Even if foals are cute, I hope not
<cachi01> StinkomanFan: lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's been tons of custom original ponies in there
<Lil_B> ahhh... the smell of all the base
<APPLEBLOOM111> Hasbro doesn't give a flying feather about their toys!
<CrimsonPhoenix> APPLEBLOOM111, HA HAHAHAHAHA yeah no
<CrimsonPhoenix> Toys are all that Hasbro care about
<Bacon[Hazard]> Hasbro is a money making giant similar to Activision.
<cachi01> well its true CrimsonPhoenix
<cachi01> their toys suck
<CrimsonPhoenix> they care about their toys more than the shows
<Vivix> Hasbro are fine, their CEO's are nice people
<JFFS> APPLEBLOOM111: of course they do. there's money coming from selling them after all
<cachi01> he only good mlp toys were the mcdonalds ones
<Vivix> but Hub is nicer
<cachi01> and the blindbags
<Bacon[Hazard]> "I LOVE MAKING NEW FRIENDS!"
<cachi01> the*
<JRP2234> NewSuperBronyU
<Lil_B> Hasbro has a deal with Zynga now, Hasbro sells now Board games of Social Games
<CrimsonPhoenix> What's wrong with brushables
<APPLEBLOOM111> The mcdonalds ones look more accurate. Except the cutie marks
<Bacon[Hazard]> Zynga sucks.
<cachi01> theres a Farmville board game?
<cachi01> WTF
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH NOES I HAVE TO MAKE THE HAIR MYSELF
<Vivix> wah huh?
<cachi01> HASBRO
<cachi01> STAHP
<Lil_B> cachi01 and a words with friends board game
<cachi01> really?
<cachi01> hasbro
<StinkomanFan> Headcanon: Hasbro is a realy company in Equestria and sells toys based on Humans
<Vivix> but..that already exists!
<Lil_B> it it looks like Hasbro is ressurecting Furbys
<cachi01> hasbro stahp
*NewSuperBronyU hugs Lil_B back :D
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02DashWithRainbows: It cool :D
<Lil_B> aww :3
<Bacon[Hazard]> Do you know what I did when I found out that Hasbro made MLP? I nearly psised myself when their logo popped up.
<Bacon[Hazard]> *pissed*
<cachi01> Lil_B: after all this years of peace.....they strike again......the horror has returned...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, they did indeed, one or two months ago
<alexxm> CrimsonPhoenix what happened
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix I was searching for something MLP releated on theirt siate and it was on the frontpage -.-

<StinkomanFan> Why Furbies? Why not the Rubix Cube?
<HoodyNinja> AttackWithHugs: Hai gurl, wutchu doin?
*AttackWithHugs hugs Jmo
<Lil_B> cachi01 I remember back in the very early 2000, damn... everyoner needed them... for some reason
<APPLEBLOOM111> Hasbro wants to make less episodes just because they think kids don't mind reruns. And they said that they want to make less episodess so they don't have to pay as much or something like that.
<Bacon[Hazard]> Because everybody already has one.
<AttackWithHugs> HoodyNinja, I doin' fine. Just gettin' home from church
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/IAZ8QG8uz9I

He then wandered into the back of the convention and saw a pony all alone. This
<TheMonstaMuffin> yo yo yo Rainbow

<J_E_Smith71> My history teacher used to be in a hair metal band in the 80s and one day he...
<J_E_Smith71> Oh wait
<Saturn> 08,01go on
<J_E_Smith71> Didn't expect that, thanks guys
<J_E_Smith71> My history teacher used to be in a hair metal band in the 80s and one night he and the other people in the band went around clubbing
<J_E_Smith71> They were at one club and one guy in the band came up and said, "Hey guys there's this wooden leg with a Nike shoe in it. It's so good, I'm gonna take it." So he takes the shoe and leg under his coat and they leave. Some time later...
<J_E_Smith71> Some time later they were at a different club (Been a while since I heard the story so I can't remember the names of these places) and someone else they knew came up to them. He was at the club they were at earlier. He told them that the police were all over the club they were just at, turing the whole place inside out. They asked why and he said "The DJ was a Vitenam vet and someone stole his prosthetic leg!"
<Saturn> 08,01not sure if end of story >.>

<Saturn> 08,01oh, there's more?
<Saturn> 08,01go ahead
<J_E_Smith71> So they went down to the club where they took the leg and sure enough the cops were searching all over the place.
<Wrek> 05can i lick your beard?
<Saturn> 08,01sure
*Wrek licks
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/VekEY.jpg
<DashWithRainbows> Oh snap
<DashWithRainbows> That's pretty hardcore
<J_E_Smith71> They didn't want to just walk in, so they went over to some guy passing by on the street and gave him the leg and said "Hey could you bring that in to that club?" So the guy takes the leg and goes into the club. My teacher and the band goes into a parking lot across from the club and watches what happens. The fellow they gave the leg to goes into the club, then quickly runs out with the cops chasing him.
<J_E_Smith71> My teacher felt dirty and told me "I'm going to hell for that."
<J_E_Smith71> Okay now I'm done
<HoodyNinja> I'll tell you a story you might not believe, but I tell you it is true

<Everlasting_Joy> http://mlfw.info/f/8250/
<ekips> best song in the game starts and you die :/
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: .-.
<cachi01> thx god no shitty artists appear while listening to the scorpions
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: i dont understand why ppl hate vevo? it has most of there favourite bands songs in each account
<cachi01> accualy im hearing scorpions on their vevo channel xd
*Michael wonders what song is hearing cachi01
<cachi01> Michael: wind of change
<Michael> cachi01: nice choice!
<cachi01> :3
<cachi01> its one of my fave scorpions song
<DoctoDoctorWho> weird
<Kandarihu> I pirated this game, and I've been wanting to buy it normally. Full price only, though
<Deacon> how is it?
<Kandarihu> It's worth paying for.
*Michael is hearing bridge over troubled water
<cachi01> wind of change, big city nights, sill loving you, the zoo and rock you like a hurricane are my fave scorpions songs
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: well for example what i mentioned, trying to watch an abba video with bieber and minaj on the sides of the video
<cachi01> i dont like abba but anyway... they are like one of the biggest bands of the 60's and they place bieber and minaj on the recommended.
<cachi01> dafuq
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: they try too hard with publicity
<Everlasting_Joy> cachi01: They place those two on nearly everything.
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/svNm1.jpg
<BladedWings> good afternoon everypony ^_^
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: thats only one complaint i have, but you think by now they'll do something about it

<cachi01> hi BladedWings :)
<alexxm|foal> how've you been BladedWings
<DerpyMuffins> What is Twilight doing Michael?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai BladedWings :)
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: i doubt it, its kind of what they do, theyre not composers, their job is to advertise
<ekips> Blocking is so important in this game
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi BladedWings
<Michael> DerpyMuffins: playing?
<BladedWings> alexxm|foal: not bad ^_^
<Deacon> so is this guy trapped in an alternate dimension or something?
*BladedWings hugs Michael Deacon Everlasting_Joy superretroworld cachi01 alexxm|foal MLP_Brovakiin and twilight_sprinkle
<Kandarihu> Deacon, not anymore.
<Michael> maybe a dungeon Deacon
<cachi01> THATS FUCKING IT
<ekips> Deacon his world got destroyed by something only referred to "The Calamity"
*MLP_Brovakiin hugs BladedWings back :3
<cachi01> FUCKING VEVO
*Everlasting_Joy hugs BladedWings back :).
<cachi01> FUCK YOU TO FUCKING HELL
*Deacon hugs BladedWings for the kindness :D
<cachi01> >IRON MAIDEN
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: idk wheater to love there idea or hate it
<ekips> Deacon now he needs to find pieces for the "Bastion" so everything can be rebuilt
<cachi01> >ONE DIRECTION ON RECOMMENDED
<SpeccyRush> Meanwhile: http://i.imgur.com/n4J59.jpg see toldya ya make more then one face =P
<cachi01> WTF
<Deacon> ekips gotcha
<Bronysith> cachi01: thats what you get for being a 9gagger
<Michael> lol
<Meanwhile> Oh SpeccyRush, I'd ask how you managed to get hold of that but I have my suspicions already.
<alexxm|foal> whats the point of cooking something if you can't cook it
<Deacon> c'mon, it's vevo, they're known to be evil
<alexxm|foal> i mean eat
<ekips> who is streaming btw?
<cachi01> Bronysith: cant understand the hate for 9gag
<MLP_Brovakiin> ekips: Nittany_Discord is
<ekips> thanks MLP_Brovakiin
<Bronysith> cachi01: cause you're a 9gagger
<cachi01> Bronysith: well as long as it makes me laugh
<SpeccyRush> Meanwhile: you link it, or some one else does and I save it for future use
<Deacon> cachi01 it, like instagram and reddit, are hated because of the community there, but I doubt you're anything like that
<Kandarihu> Well, he has to find energy cores to power the Bastion. That allows it to build itself.
<cachi01> Deacon: yeah most people on 9gag are douches
<Michael> ^
<SpeccyRush> Meanwhile: just like this one http://tinychat.com/ss63/9f4722/b0/baconmane/go258/10-26-2012
<cachi01> 4chan is just filled with crazy people
<cachi01> reddit. well reddit is fine
<Kandarihu> But he seems to be in the 2nd half of the game where he's hunting for shards, which are less powerful than cores.
<Bronysith> 4chan is best site
<Michael> cachi01: mostly on /b
<Meanwhile> SpeccyRush: There is nothing that can bring context to that image.
<cachi01> /h/ ftw xd
<Deacon> everywhere else, they're level headed....well except for /v/
<SpeccyRush> Meanwhile: except when neil says DON'T LOOK AT THAT IMAGE, THAT IS NOT ME
<CrimsonPhoenix> Deacon, /v/ is /b/2.0
<Meanwhile> SpeccyRush: It totally is him. And that totally is his hair.
<SpeccyRush> Meanwhile: 'swhy I saved it, to mess with him
<magmablock> I need an overly poetic narrator for my daily life
<ekips> Btw, if you like the soundtrack of this game. It's on Bandcamp
<Kandarihu> Oh, did he do Jawson Bog yet?
<cachi01> http://oi47.tinypic.com/1j6hpf.jpg i dont want to live on this planet anymore
<CrimsonPhoenix> Winter Wrap-up is oficially the best song
<CrimsonPhoenix> comfirmed by hte writers in the panel
<Vordox> cachi01: What?
<Everlasting_Joy> CrimsonPhoenix: That's a funny way of spelling "Smile Smile Smile".
<cachi01> ^
<Michael> CrimsonPhoenix: i prefer smile :(
<Deacon> ft. nicki minaj? oh boy
<cachi01> i know...
<Lil_B> ekips got it when it was on the Humble Bundle :)
<ekips> Lil_B: I don't have Paypal, so I got it on Steam^^
<Chrysalis> sounds like the dungeon keeper announcer
*Bronysith sets Chrysalis on fire
<Lil_B> ekips don't they support amazon Payment as well?
*Chrysalis is inflammable
<Lil_B> ohey Chrysalis !
<ekips> Lil_B dunno, I'm using Paysafecards

<Michael> the hero of BS!
<Vordox> Lil_B: Better that then staring other place and talking
<Vordox> It's like....
<MadSurge> Where does the RAVING FURIOUS SEX line come from again?

<Meanwhile> MadSurge: The anti-bullying PSA.
<MadSurge> Ah
<Vordox> Sgtill. As I said
<Vordox> If me and Saturn met, it would be a perma stare
<Vordox> And most people around would just go "wtf"
<Lil_B> oni_link I had it happen before, and people start to look bad at me wierd, that's why I try to not look directly into their eyes
<Vordox> You know what's fun...
<Vordox> Check when Applejack talks
<Vordox> She always has a eyes on the person talking to her unless she is busy
<Lil_B> well... staring contests I have zro problems with xD
<Vordox> People don't notice that :P
<cachi01> Vordox: Aj and her good manners lol
<oni_link> Lil_B: aw I used to get that in school since people apparantly thought I was intimidating back then
<Vordox> Believe it or nt
<Lil_B> yeah, same
<Vordox> I have a VERy scary face

<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352061606538.png
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/dtFMG.jpg the feels...
<oni_link> Bronysith: aw shit got real
<Bronysith> Michael: and now u die
<oni_link> indeed Michael ;~;
<Michael> Bronysith: :'(
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: that does not explain why you said that, I find it a bit insulting and wish to know if you have at least a little reasoning behind your accusations.
<DerpyMuffins> No feels here Michael
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: I always have a reason of everything I say
<DerpyMuffins> Never liked Fluttershy in the first place
<Vordox> Why else would I write? O.o
<MadSurge> I don't, and it's funnier that way
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352060472571.png
<MadSurge> How can you not like 'Shy? :O
<twilight_sprinkle> i can
<Vordox> My reasoning is, you're being spoiled on what you get based on previous adaptions of creativities from he former people that worked on those shows
<DerpyMuffins> I just dont like Fluttershy
<MadSurge> Bronysith: your dream, admit it :D
<Vordox> Therefore, you expect more then you would get based on previous incantations
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont hate her, just think shes overrated
<Vordox> BUT LO AND BEHOLD
<Lil_B> Vordox you look damn much like a Guy I went to school with once ... this white button-shirt and the lenght of the hair -.-like, exactly, even the goofy smiule in the pic
<Bronysith> MadSurge: needs more bedroom eyes tbh
<Vordox> Sexy Twilight http://imageshack.us/a/img201/8523/sexylolz.jpg =P
<DoctoDoctorWho> then explain why you called me "too spoiled" for looking at past events and using that data to predict future ones Vordox.
<oni_link> ha!
<MadSurge> Bronysith: too bad, you get Molestia first
<MadSurge> Vordox: :D
<Bronysith> MadSurge: >implying molestia doesnt have bedroom eyes
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: Cause predicting Data on previous years is as exact as looking at Nostrademeus today
<Vordox> Lil_B: Was he a fun guy?
<AdamTheDuck> Good morning BronyState :)
<MadSurge> Bronysith: no, just "you're gonna get touched" eyes
<DerpyMuffins> Hai AdamTheDuck

<DerpyMuffins> Dem stalker eyes Bronysith
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai AdamTheDuck :)
<AdamTheDuck> "you're gonna get touched" eyes lolwut .-.
<cachi01> best eyes ever
<Lil_B> Vordox yes, but no, he had a heavy hessian accent, and you are from swedish :P
<MadSurge> Ohai AdamTheDuck
<twilight_sprinkle> [16:13:32] <Lil_B> ohgod, Season 5 announced, will have 3 eps , directed by Tommy Wiseau, writing by Michael Bay <-- FUND IT
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: Bronysith can't accept Molestia has no bedroom eyes
<Bronysith> MadSurge: but she does

<Cypresswolf> http://i.imgur.com/l35BJ.jpg
<alexxm|foal> Vordox was that a real sega advert
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: If I made an incorrect prediction, then that makes me wrong. I dont know how it makes me spoiled.
<Vordox> Alchemist: I think so. Not sure

<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: You expect something that's not expected
<AdamTheDuck> pony_3498, the best show, the buffer show.
<Vordox> And if that's wrong, you'll go and become sad/Rage instead
*AdamTheDuck licks Domo \:3/
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, very nice drawing

<Vordox> ALL OF THEM
<Invi> Vordox, so this is typical german?
<MadSurge> Crossdressers, please
<Lil_B> Vordox actually, it's more a mix of slawic and german
<oni_link> Vordox: Well yeah I dont think thats a good thingthough XD

*Kurra headtilt
*thelonepony hugs Kurra :3
<Vordox> cachi01: XD
<donutpop365> No stream or just me?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: Your logic then begins to work against you. If you think that I will sad/rage because I was wrong about there being 6 seasons, then I dont get mad over it and prove you wrong thus making you spoiled by your own logical argument.
<Vordox> I don't expect anything really.
<Vordox> So how can I be..spoiled by any means of that word?
<pony_3498> can we watch something now pls?
<cachi01> wait.....only 6 seasons?
<cachi01> oh...
<cachi01> :(
<Vordox> cachi01: DoctoDoctorWho expects there'll be 6 seasons
<Vordox> Based on previous works of Lauren
<MadSurge> Already linked, but aaaaaaaaaa <3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVxhK3Hvhig
<Vordox> (Who is not working anymore on MLP)
<Bronysith> even if there were to be 6 seasons doesn't mean they will be good
<cachi01> Vordox: oh yeah. ppg and foster only had seasons
<cachi01> 6*
<Invi> MadSurge, d'aaw ^^
<CrimsonPhoenix> may I remind you that those seasons had less than 20 episodes
<Lil_B> I still say that S5 needs Tommy Wiseau and Michael Bay, maybe Uwe Boll for the Finale
<DoctoDoctorWho> The flaw in Vordox's argument here, is that he did not differentiate between "expecting" and "hopefull predictions"
<MadSurge> I want them to stop when they run out of ideas, so FiM doesn't turn on Spongebob
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: Really?
<Chrysalis> ^
<gunthler> O_o
<MadSurge> Ohai Chrysalis :)
<Chrysalis> hey
<Vordox> <DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: If I made an incorrect prediction, then that makes me wrong. I dont know how it makes me spoiled.
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Chrysalis
<Kurra> So Apparently, this weekend I will be able to see the premiere of new pony!
<Vordox> Predictions based on work where Lauren was in staff at most of the times
<Vordox> Compared to MLP where she left after first.
<Kurra> Which is a YAY in my book!
<Rex_Mundi> Just came back from seeing Wrek-it-Ralph!
<Invi> MadSurge, i guess when they run out of ideas they are going to ask the bronies ^^
<Vordox> Those flaws alone make your prediction more of expectations =P
<Robotdragon9> EY everypony
<Invi> hi Robotdragon9
<MadSurge> Invi: not the smut ideas I hope :D
<Michael> ohai Robotdragon9
<Lil_B> Good thing we don't live in the 80's or 90's anymore, the chances of getting a Life Actian Adaptation are about 0 (except for the last Airbender)...
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Robotdragon9

<Robotdragon9> currently playing through Area 51 for ps2
<Bronysith> i forgot how much i hate the morning bronystate crowd
<MadSurge> Bronysith: ewww american pizza
<cachi01> Robotdragon9: is that game good?
<Lil_B> MadSurge "Giving the Pony Socks?... actually thats Brilliant! More Accosiarys to be sold!"
<Vordox> Women: I like 50 shades of Grey: Men: I like Porn. <--- C wat I did thar? =P
<Lil_B> Accossiar... dI don't care
<MadSurge> Lil_B: accessories :D
<Robotdragon9> cachi01 my first shooter ever...i liked it, its good.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: Base point is, Im not expecting them to make 6 seasons, I just took previous data and used that to predict the future. If they dont go that far, Im not gonna rage.
<cachi01> Robotdragon9: oh might give it a try sometime :)
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: Then why did you tell the others then?
<Lil_B> MadSurge no, I spelled it just as I intended it... wrong
*AdamTheDuck licks Bronysith .-.
<Robotdragon9> cachi01 ok have fun :)
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: If not to raise their expectations, and therefore their consequences of their communication with you, some of them will expect it
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: how does he taste like?
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/dimII.jpg
<Vordox> Therefore, you claim your actions to be for yourself, but you tell it to others, which is...what then exactly?
<Robotdragon9> Bronysith wat
<CrimsonPhoenix> Wow this sound panel is getting interesting
<Rex_Mundi> What could happen, is they could end the show, but continue G4 with occasional TV/DVD/Blu-ray hour long specials like they did with G3.
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, he taste... Like http://derpy.me/LwJ-D

<AdamTheDuck> Bronysith, XD
<Lil_B> I still hold to my Idea of a MLP Spinnoff show, or revamped version, that appeals more to older audiences (more intense action, different artsyle etc.)
<AJIsAwesome> Good afternoon, everyone. How are you all today? :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: because when people find something they like, one of two things happen. they either A: take the road of greed and keep it to themselves, or B: They share it and increase their own happiness by enjoying their discovery with others, I believe this was the lesson of episode 3?
<Robotdragon9> i cant see it, my computer wont let me

<Bronysith> my god this car pile up is awesome
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Lil - gone
<CrimsonPhoenix> yes?
<Robotdragon9> ok ive got alotta tabs down
<Bronysith> were all these police cars necessary ?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: And for the record, Im 16. Not like that makes a single difference except that it makes you look bad by falling back on the "we dont agree, therefore you must be young and immature" arguement. This whole thing started because you unneccesaraly insulted me on the basis of a prediction that only time can prove true or false. Thus, Im not really at fault here, not implying that there is somepony to blame to begin with,
<Michael> omg
<Bronysith> DoctoDoctorWho: quit your bitching
<Bronysith> u mad?
<MadSurge> Dat wall of text
<Bronysith> he mad
<Vordox> Bronysith: Please, behave.
<oni_link> Chat derped, what happened?
<MadSurge> oni_link: people fussing
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: It's not aboutImmature, it's about experience of the humanrace.
<oni_link> ah
<Vordox> And suddenly my spacebar is not working
<Frenchy_pony> Invi: try this one for full screen http://www.justin.tv/everfreemedia#/w/4113281824/2
<Michael> http://derpy.me/uGFWg
<Vordox> One person gives hopefull prediction, then we had WW2
<Vordox> Need I put it in a bigger scale? =P
<Invi> Frenchy_pony, okay. that is much better. merci ^^
<Vordox> Or better yet, one person incites hope in a group of people, people don't get it, they do actions, And what happens of those actions?
<Vordox> "For enjoyment of others" I feel is the wrong word no matter how you look at it.
<Michael> Gnight everypony, HF!
<oni_link> night Michael
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Michael
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Michael.:)
<Robotdragon9> bai Michael

<pony_3498> its like going on and on and on and on and on
<alexxm|foal> bye Michael
<CrimsonPhoenix> This Victor Frost guy is amazing
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: and I made a prediction based on past events, just like people have been doing for thousands of years, Its not so big a deal that you must get mad over it. In fact, the only one I see here getting worked up like you say is you.
<oni_link> pony_3498: you have to realize mods are people too
<pony_2049> STICK MY PENIS IN UNDERAGE HORSES STICK MY PENIS IN UNDERAGE HORSES STICK MY PENIS IN UNDERAGE HORSES STICK MY PENIS IN UNDERAGE HORSES STICK MY PENIS IN UNDERAGE HORSES STICK MY PENIS IN UNDERAGE HORSES STICK MY PENIS IN UNDERAGE HORSES STICK MY PENIS IN UNDERAGE HORSES STICK MY PENIS IN UNDERAGE HORSES STICK MY PENIS IN UNDERAGE HORSES STICK MY PENIS IN UNDERAGE HORSES STICK MY PENIS IN UNDERAGE HORSES STICK MY PENIS IN UNDERA

<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: and we can have differing opinions, and thats fine.
<Invi> he was a pedo
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: sad attempt at trolling XD
<MLP_Brovakiin> What an ass...
<MadSurge> ^
<Vordox> At tops, unless something happens, it'l be 3 and a half season
<Wubstep> Hurrow :3
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Wubstep :)
<Bronysith> also i dont think the mane six are underagged, i mean they have jobs for the love of god
<BladedWings> hi Wubstep ^_^
<Vordox> Not even close to 6 is possible
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Wubstep
<thelonepony> hi Wub wub Wubstep :3
<alexxm|foal> wow that was odd
<Robotdragon9> ikr
<alexxm|foal> how are things Wubstep
<BladedWings> moving along Bronysith lol
<Vordox> What I am basing it on, is not about the previous work, but the current situation of the work.
<killerpony7733> Bronysith Nah isn't trolling at all. Trolling is making comedic fun out of a situation and what not
<Vordox> Past is not the same as the new. =P
<Vordox> now*
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Wubstep. :)
<Wubstep> What Did I Miss? D:
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/3ifWx.jpg?1
<oni_link> so did those weirdos get kicked yet
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: I could see 4 happening, the 4 horses of the apocalypse would make a badass s4 plot twist.
<Robotdragon9> Wubstep bad trolling
<DoctoDoctorWho> agree?
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: ...
<DukeThaKilla> yolo
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: That would be awesome, but we're Hasbro here
<BladedWings> DoctoDoctorWho: lol
<Vordox> They had a fit with Derpy...
<Vordox> You expect 4 horses of death and apocalypse would go through?
<Vordox> But my prediction still stands, unless a miracle happens.
<Vordox> 3 and a half season, at best.
<Robotdragon9> i just noticed how similar the chimera in resistance look a lot like the leapers and thetas from area 51.....
<DoctoDoctorWho> Blood doesnt need to spill, even death doesnt need to kill anypony, he can just make the land all barren and crap.
<MadSurge> How long is a half season?

<Vordox> It's a FUN image no doubt... but damn
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: hope is a type of assumption that everything will turn out for the better, religion is belief in a higher power.

<cachi01> Vordox: zombies
<GilDash> Vordox: Medically speaking you are alive. Technically speaking you are writing, not talking.
<flutterchu> since i ate my candy i have a HUGE hole in my permanit jaw and my tounge has a bunch of bumps on it, now it it's whenever i speak or eat
<DerpyMuffins> Vordox is getting KINDA annoying

<Vordox> Either you DO
<Vordox> Or you DON'T
<Robotdragon9> lol
<GilDash> MadSurge: Yay! I shall go find rainbows more often! ^_^
<Vordox> There's no "maybe".
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: "I hope it doesnt rain tomorrow" is not the same as "God is our saviour"
<cachi01> guys
<cachi01> what r u doin?
<cachi01> guys
<cachi01> STAHP
<MadSurge> ^
<DerpyMuffins> I have been afk
<Vordox> You BELIEVE it'll not rain, doesn't mean it's reasoned to a god at all.
<Vordox> It's still a BELIEF.
<cachi01> STAHP
<Bronysith> STFU
<Bronysith> fucking hell
<Bronysith> goddamn fucking internet argument
<MadSurge> Vardoss, STAHP

<Bronysith> DerpyMuffins: no hes not
<FlutterWarrior> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVfMLA6B2t4
<GilDash> What the hell? Why is religion even being dicussed?
<Deacon> Rex_Mundi you and me both
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<Vordox> Rex_Mundi: No, it's about "belief"
<Vordox> Nothing to do with God.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good afternoon everyone
<MadSurge> GilDash: no mods around? :|
<Ponies47> Hello TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<cachi01> hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
<BladedWings> ohai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<DerpyMuffins> Hai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, TheGreatAndPowerfulT. :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
<Deacon> lali-ho TGAP
<MadSurge> Ohai TheGreatAndPowerfulT!
<cachi01> T
<Robotdragon9> well im gonna go now see u guys later.
<BladedWings> bye Robotdragon9
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye Robotdragon9 :)
<cachi01> cya Robotdragon9 :)
<Vordox> Belief is believing in something. That something can be anything, but it's still a belief. ._.
<BladedWings> i believe this agument needs to stop
<alexxm|foal> how've you been TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<cachi01> Vordox: stahp!
<MadSurge> I believe we should stop this
<Vordox> I believe that this argument is something that needs be taken serious due to that it's within the English Dictionary
<cachi01> lets change topic.....
<AdamTheDuck> ohai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Vordox> And by not knowing what it is, you show symptons of using the word wrongly.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: If you believe it wont rain tomorrow, then that is saying you know it wont. If you hope it doesnt rain tomorrow, that is saying you dont know but are well, hoping that it doesnt.
<Rex_Mundi> Lets talk about our theories of the ponyverse/Equestrias history, instead.
<GilDash> Is there nothing else of interest to talk about?
<MadSurge> SSHHHHHHH
<thelonepony> Lets change the Topic pls
<GilDash> How about the weather? What is it like in your area?
<Vordox> GilDash: http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/1435/wtfrzl.jpg Bronies and their R32 can stick it =P
<DerpyMuffins> Great another debate
<cachi01> Vordox: just take it to another chat. and lets talk about ponies in this chat or something else
<BladedWings> GilDash: guess not
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm Good alexxm|foal and you ?
<alexxm|foal> i'm good TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<cachi01> Vordox: oh god what xDD
<BladedWings> Vordox: :D
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone wanna place bets?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Vordox: Why would you have that! :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> I tried to get everypony talking about 40k, but noooooooo!:D
<BladedWings> DerpyMuffins: on what?
<Vordox> MLP_Brovakiin: Ask the person driving it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, Rule 32?
<DerpyMuffins> Who keeps something like that Vordox :D
<Vordox> OR what the rule was
<BladedWings> 34
<Vordox> Anything can be sexified or something
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yeah Rule 34
<DerpyMuffins> Its R34
<BladedWings> aaaaanyway
<AdamTheDuck> If it exists, there's a porn of it, no exceptions.
<DoctoDoctorWho> ^
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: You're still implying hope as in belief. ._. same is with thinking then...
<GilDash> We've gone from belief to R34? Is there nothing else to discuss? XD
<BladedWings> So....6 more days ^_^
<DerpyMuffins> R34.2 is if it exist there is a pony of it
<Punkie_Pue> The exception is r35
<thelonepony> BladedWings: eeyu[ ^_^
<cachi01> an internet rule that states that if it can be said, it can be said with a picturewhy say "i see what you did there" when you can just as easily scour the interweb for hours trying to find a picture of an owl with a text edit saying the same thing? that's rule 32
<thelonepony> eeyup*
<MLP_Brovakiin> It was all fun and games untill you brought in the rules ._.
<Bronysith> STFU WITH THE RULES
<DerpyMuffins> Great how did this get from religion to rules?
<cachi01> BRING ALL THE RULES
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: Go check up the word Think and Belief =P
*MadSurge starts hitting chat with a slipper
<AJIsAwesome> Ouch! ;~;
<Vordox> Also, look at Prediction while you are at it

<GilDash> I've just realised I can't tell you the weather from where I am as it's too dark to see.
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: You are arguing a lost point. you made an accusation toward me on something you thought I would do, without any foreknowledge of me. My actions do not correspond with your predictions, so drop it already.
<MadSurge> GilDash: :D it's England, it's cloudy or raining
<Invi> GilDash, well you should notice if you see stars or if it is raining ^^
<MadSurge> GilDash: you have a 50% chance :D
<Vordox> Fine, go ahead, screw things up =P *Blunt*

<Deacon> I want a game where the graphics are 1:1 realism, but have a guy eating a piece of toast for 10 hours
<GilDash> How is that a game?
<Vordox> cachi01: You know of it though?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Deacon: where you are may be cold, but here in wisconson its, *puts on sunglasses* 20% cooler.
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuYWLYjOa_0 <-- Child of Eden
<AdamTheDuck> I think people estimated in about 10 years, it may be possible to have games that look no different from reality.
<Deacon> well actually, weather's been moody lately, it's been hot and cold
<Invi> AdamTheDuck, in about 10 years we'll have augmented reality

<GilDash> What is this Gravity Falls thing? Is it a TV show or something?
<Deacon> it's pretty decent, though I only saw about one to two episodes
<MadSurge> GilDash: yep, and it's a nice one too
<GilDash> I asked *what* it was, not wether it was any good. -_-
<Deacon> can't say that I recall a time where the guy was the straight man in a cartoon and the girl was the comic relief
<Vordox> Deacon: Talking about Samurai Champloo?
<GilDash> I can't recall it every being the other way around. :S
<Deacon> Vordox well american animation

<AttackWithHugs> How the heck do you determine what your Bacon Number is?
<BroPony|MEDIC> all this talk of bacon makes me want bacon
<Polydunami> We know Saturn, therefore we all have a Bacon number of 4.
<AJIsAwesome> GilDash: AHHH. Thanks. :D

<FlutterMEDIC> right now i'm bored out of my fucking mind since i have no idea when Assassin's Creed 3 comes out for PC
<Friendchips> Hi thelonepony
<flutterchu> *nom nom nom nom nom nom nom*
<Rex_Mundi> So here is my idea for an episode, what if season 3 has the Breezies, and Twilight finds Spike underground after pulling a weed. And because of that she is made Princess of ponyville, and then Spike trains Twilight to be a Princess, but then this makes everypony ells nervious. so Twilight decrees that everypony is a princess. The End.
<Saturn> 08,01alexxm: yup
<BroPony|MEDIC> FlutterMEDIC: No one knows :O
<AJIsAwesome> Here's the link: http://www.everfree.net/eqla/
<FlutterMEDIC> Rex_Mundi: oh hell no
<AJIsAwesome> Oh my gosh, now it's $1000. :D
<Rex_Mundi> :P:P:P:D:D:D
<Bronysith> dat emote spam
<Bronysith> goddamnit
<JFFS> Rex_Mundi: That would be... The best episode ever!!
<BroPony|MEDIC> AJIsAwesome: /)
<AJIsAwesome> You're too easily annoyed, Sith. :D
<Bronysith> considering its against the rules...
<FlutterMEDIC> ORIGINAL SKETCH OF DISCORD
<BroPony|MEDIC> ^
<Friendchips> Rex_Mundi, why not make an alternate universe where they are foals and scootaloo is their age and so is Cherille and they're sisters and the same age and Rainbow dash always dresses in style?
<Saturn> 08,01hey FlutterMEDIC
<twilight_sprinkle> 1000 dollars
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: People spam emotes all the time, but there's no reason to get mad EVERY single time. :D
<FlutterMEDIC> hi dar Saturn, a little late there
<twilight_sprinkle> just..wow
<Paspie> anyway, night
<Saturn> 08,01FlutterMEDIC: you mean *real* pony?
<FlutterMEDIC> what?
<Rex_Mundi> Friendchips: I know right, and one of the episodes is called "the princess promenade". and Spike can be posh English.
<BroPony|MEDIC> Wow wish i was there
<AJIsAwesome> Friendchips: Dat synopsis. :D
<Friendchips> and that could be an episode and all? But it still would be witty and inteligent and have good animation
<HeavyWeapony_Guy>
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Uhoh, Twitter limited me again
<BroPony|MEDIC> anyone wanna buy sum music...
<Rex_Mundi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6ZAmm721-Q

<Polydunami> RISK: Tumblr edition :3
<JFFS> wow nice
<AJIsAwesome> It's $130 now.
<JFFS> but Nutella shouldn't be on the hipster continent
<FlutterMEDIC> makes sense that Equestria is its own continent there
<AJIsAwesome> Ah, Dusty is auctioning a "Stay Brony My Friends" hoof print emblem.
<Vordox> Have some Brony Nostalgi
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4mIFK148go&feature=g-vrec
<AJIsAwesome> It's now going for $140
<Friendchips> Where is nerd island? With rpgs and stuff like that?
<Rex_Mundi> Why, Sesaon 3 can be rid of all those bad things that bring the series down. Any danger or villainous characters is too unpleasent, and who wants developed characters anyways? No sir, G4 should be like G3 with its tea parties and non-conflicts and simple characters. thats what makes a good show!
<BroPony|MEDIC> Friendchips: Probably somewhere small
<Bronysith> these goddamn walls
<Friendchips> darn.

<Vordox> Saturn: Never clean that cheek again :P
<Chrysalis> aw man
<Rex_Mundi> Saturn: Win. But in my opinion, brushables are better than blind bags, because blindbags are just decoration, but brushables have pretty hair that you can brush!
<AJIsAwesome> BroPony|MEDIC: Ah, I can understand that. Me too, but there was a lot of MLP stuff at mine.
<AttackWithHugs> I don't have any brushables.
<Saturn> 08,01Rex_Mundi: it's a custom brushable

<Sumica> 00,10they are still filming the how to make a dimond ep, check back in a few eons
<cachi01> or was it only a paper?
<Shizuka> 13so really, diamonds aren't terribly valuable, the price comes from the huge effort needed to make them pretty
<cachi01> AJIsAwesome: great i'll grab my stuff!
<CrimsonPhoenix> >Show up on my credit card bill
<Sumica> 00,10yes Shizuka
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: There is no time, your sword is enough!

<weeping_pegasi82> I'd rather have a ruby
<Shizuka> 13veemi pauses for about a second every five.-.
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: and artificially inflated prices of the diamond industry
*Saturn 08,01hates the diamond industry with a passion

<Saturn> 08,01rubies are actually rarer than diamonds, iirc
<AJIsAwesome> What's going on, CrimsonPhoenix?
<Mutterguy> I'd rather have a potato
<Saturn> 08,01and it's gone
<twilight_sprinkle> sapphires are best
<RoboGerbil> Saturn: could always just get fake diamonds
<cachi01> potato > diamond
<weeping_pegasi82> yay! my favorite gem is rarer than diamonds!
<Phase4> 00,02i got ping
<Saturn> 08,01RoboGerbil: i'd rather have other interesting stones
<RoboGerbil> or lab grown diamonds
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, nothing that's worth attention I suppose
<twilight_sprinkle> i got pong, lets play Phase4 !
<Saturn> 08,01or lab-created diamonds
<Saturn> 08,01because science.
<AdamTheDuck> It's your fault Phase4 :$
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, wait what?

<Shizuka> 13carpentry because inches scale better or something
<sub06905> we even use microwaves to make doors....
<Vordox> Saturn: Like Gallons and Stones? :P
<Shizuka> 13easier to use fractional widths than mount the decimals of meters
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, imperial is silly
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: It always cracks me up to see stuff like that, it's usually easier in metric even though I know how big an inch is. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> its not just america, but yeah, metric ftw
<CrimsonPhoenix> imperial is overall silly
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EQLA stream is done. What are you talking about?
<Sumica> 00,10you dont need precision in home construtcion
<Buytoast> Uncle Sam personally visited every carpenter in MURIKA and gave them each a statue of Jesus, to remember their humble beginnings.
<Vordox> Construtcion ftw
<Buytoast> As he left, a lone eagle perched upon their doors, signalling the truth of MURIKAN heritage.
<NocturnalBlade> all these colors lol
<AJIsAwesome> Nittany_Discord: How was the closing ceremonies? :)
<Saturn> 08,01heh
<Saturn> 08,01knob.
<Shizuka> 13i did see a discussion on it though, on why carpenters don't use metric
<twilight_sprinkle> there was a closing ceremony?
<Vordox> Silly Saturn
<Shizuka> 13it has to do with fractions of an inch that i recall
<twilight_sprinkle> i thought they canceleld it
<Vordox> Shizuka: ._. Really?
<Shizuka> 13something about that is easier to work with
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: i don't use gallons or stones
<Sumica> 00,10how balls are made
<Saturn> 08,01i use litres and kilos
<Kandarihu> I'm going to need a kickban for what I'm about to say.
<Vordox> Saturn: I know some English people use the older English measures
<CrimsonPhoenix> PAINTBALL
<CrimsonPhoenix> AW SHIT
<twilight_sprinkle> maybe imperial is just more convenient historically for industrial stuff
<Vordox> Stone is one of the more famous ones
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, ... please stop
<sub06905> then dont say it :D
<Shizuka> 13the bigger reason is imperial has inertia
<Sumica> 00,10paintballs omnomnom
<AJIsAwesome> Meh, I never liked Paintball.
<Saturn> 08,01one of the stupidest measurements ever is miles/gallon
<CrimsonPhoenix> so Paintballs are candies
<Buytoast> You dare to try and stop the words of a red blooded MURIKAN?
<Petrified_Discord> Tasty tasty paintballs
<Vordox> Saturn: Miles you mean 10000 metres?
<Shizuka> 13Saturn: why so?
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: nope
<Sumica> 00,10the drop? so paintballs are dubstep?
<Shizuka> 13it's the measure of distance traveled per unit of fuel consumed
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: because it's doubly unworkable in metric
<Buytoast> boy, look at all that maple syrup
<sub06905> paintballs=dibstep
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, your ridicule of patriotism is getting under my skin.
<Shizuka> 13yeah well

<Shizuka> 13we invented cars
<Shizuka> 13SO THERE

<Vordox> Midnight_Stormwing: Lol
<Buytoast> From the ashes of war, we forged MURIKA from nothing but a 50 foot eagle and a handheld picture of jesus holding the MURIKAN flag.
<cachi01> THATS IT
<cachi01> I WON
<Kandarihu> Phase4, Comcast isn't an invention, it's just a company that delivers service that's generally good but leaves MUCH to be desired.
<Shizuka> 13yeah well

<Stallion_of_War> Picks of just your glasses Shizu?
<AdamTheDuck> Why do you think that HoodyNinja? .-.
<Kandarihu> I also wouldn't mind replacing my eyes with cybernetic equivalents.
<SafariMonkey> HoodyNinja: As in 20/20? probably. :P
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: i'll just steal a load of cash and fly you over for BUCK
<Shizuka> 13CrimsonPhoenix: yeah but contacts give me the same shivers as barely watching that segment... you're still sticking something ONTO YOUR EYEBALL

<AVS619> lol
<Sumica> 00,10but popplers are people too
<Kandarihu> Problem is, an EMP would blind me permamently, and probably fry my brain.
<Saturn> 08,01DashWithRainbows: that i will
<DerpyMuffins> Shizuka you are probaly a +5.5
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, did you know all of this already?
<SafariMonkey> You're back Arcane

<Kandarihu> I'd have to be wearing... FARADAY SHADES!
<Shizuka> 13my right eye is worse than my left, one or both has astigmatism
<Shizuka> 13i think the right
<DashWithRainbows> Then I will stay away from you, Saturn, if I am capable of going to BUCK.

<Shizuka> 13whichever one means i blur two feet in front of me <<
<Saturn> 08,01CrimsonPhoenix: not really, but i know how to make a cello
<Stallion_of_War> BUCK = BCUK = Brony Connection UK?

<Shizuka> 13i always forget if nearsighted means you see near or can't see near
<flutterchu> AND DONT YOU DARE STREAM IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Mutterguy> Shizuka.. are you me?
<AdamTheDuck> flutterchu, pfft, I've seen documentaries on genetically modified foods and I can still eat burgers fine.

<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: you went to culinary school?
<Mutterguy> Sumica beofore or after they shoot the cow?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<SafariMonkey> Shizuka: farsighted is if things a long way aren't blurry
<Derpy_Hooves> Sumica: i took animal science once, they showed us the pig and cow slaughter videos
<Shizuka> 13so nearsighted
<Sumica> 00,10they use a impact hammer to the brain Mutterguy
<BroPony|MEDIC|4-4808> aaand im back

<Mutterguy> why did i think they use a High pressue BB gun..? oh well.
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: wow, i did not know that
<SafariMonkey> Shizuka: things start to get blurry for me at about 1 foot
<Stallion_of_War> Bullets to the brain also work fairly well.
<Saturn> 08,01whoos
<twilight_sprinkle> i broke my guitar a week before my graduation exam in music school...
<Shizuka> 13:3
<Saturn> 08,01i mean Sumica
<Sumica> 00,10BB would contaminate the food
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: what kind of chef?
<Stallion_of_War> Delicous cows are delicous
<flutterchu> i liked how it's made when it was on dicovery channel
<Saturn> 08,01and goddamnit interesting stream
<Saturn> 08,01i need to go do work
<Sumica> 00,10I am better as a baker
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I need to sleep
<CrimsonPhoenix> but to hell with that
<Sumica> 00,10but right now I am a banquet cook
<HoodyNinja> CrimsonPhoenix: Sleep is for the weak
<Mutterguy> Well, it's not like anybody eats the brain these days though
<DashWithRainbows> Bubblegum and fireworks?
<sub06905> fireworks :p
<AVS619> fuck sleep
<SafariMonkey> Shizuka: and text maybe 6 inches
<Stallion_of_War> Isn't it like, 4AM in Scotland right now Saturn ?
<DashWithRainbows> This will be a good episode
<CrimsonPhoenix> HoodyNinja, go get yourself a 40 hours job and you'll love your sleep hours
<HoodyNinja> CrimsonPhoenix: If only I could
<cachi01> 40 hours job? .-.
<HoodyNinja> 40 hour work week
<Shizuka> 13the fireworks bit is actually kind of boring, gunpowder into a shell, then more gunpowder, then more gunpowder, then wrap in paper
<Kurra> I am not even sure I wanna see the stream that everyone's watchign that's making y'all freak out.
<Shizuka> 13then stock footage of fireworks
<Saturn> 08,01what?!
<Shizuka> 13Kurra: that bit's over now :)
<SafariMonkey> Shizuka: yeah I can't read normal text past 6 inches unless I really concentrate
<Saturn> 08,01fireworks are really interesting!
<HoodyNinja> Kurra: Lazer eye surgery, its gone now
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah day shift so I have to wake up at like 6 in the morning
<Mutterguy> Igot a couple of uncles that work at the Timaru freezing works...
<RDash5000> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7481/
<Saturn> 08,01i love firework design
<Kurra> Shizuka, was it an... oh okay.
<Shizuka> 13Saturn: they are, just not the way they show it <<
<weeping_pegasi82> Shizuka: it's more interesting on Dirty Jobs
<Shizuka> 13it's all procedural, none of the design aspect
<Sumica> 00,10yeah most layouts are kinda trade secrets Shizuka
<Kurra> RDash5000, what is that from? That's not from any MLP official series! :O
<Sumica> 00,10so they cant show much
<Shizuka> 13that too
<AVS619> fireworks are awesome california's firework laws are not
<Shizuka> 13there was a special on discovery or maybe history about fireworks
<Sumica> 00,10bleh fiberglass
<Shizuka> 13they demonstrated the different color stars and all kinds of cool stuff
<RDash5000> Kurra: dunno was on the mylittlefacewhen site
<Sumica> 00,10sucks if you get that crap on you
<Shizuka> 13fiberglass, asbestos 2.0
<flutterchu> *nom nom nom nom nom nom*
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: I guess if you don't show how the fireworks are designed or how the chemicals are developed and made it'd be kinda boring
<Kurra> nooooo
<Sumica> 00,10I love the firework shows we get here in vegas
<Kurra> fiberglass isn't that bad, it's the polyester resin that's riddickilous
<Saturn> 08,01drink everytime he says 'fibreglass'
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<flutterchu> ^^
<Kurra> glass fiber composite!
<HoodyNinja> I aint' got no booze!
<sub06905> ah good ol vegas, havent been there in a while
<weeping_pegasi82> I'm never going to work in a factory EVER
<Sumica> 00,10inb4 he never says it again
<Saturn> 08,01...
<Shizuka> 13yeah it's pretty much over now :3
<SafariMonkey> Shizuka: I wonder if carbon-fiber has any problems like that. :P
*Saturn 08,01grumps
<sub06905> :D
<Kurra> No SafariMonkey
<HoodyNinja> Saturn: No alchohol for you~
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'M ON A BOAT
<DerpyMuffins> I was about to empty my vodka bottle
<Kurra> But there has been a worldwide shortage of carbon fiber for like a decade
<Shizuka> 13nice boat
<sub06905> dat tv
<HoodyNinja> Limo boat
<AVS619> dat boat
<DerpyMuffins> So much for drinking tonight
<Saturn> 08,01i used to be an alcoholic
<sub06905> sp tiny
<CrimsonPhoenix> Shizuka, Goddang I remember that video
<DerpyMuffins> I am an alcogolic
<NullRadix> Saturn: what are you addicted to now?
<Saturn> 08,01i drank a bottle of sherry every night
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont drink at all
<Saturn> 08,01at least
<SafariMonkey> Kurra: I don't mean really dangerous like that, but one of my friends works with carbon fiber and apparently it's painful to work with, in the same kind of way as fiberglass
<Sumica> 00,10but do you know where it came from CrimsonPhoenix?
<twilight_sprinkle> not even water
<sub06905> ship a boat on a boat
<CrimsonPhoenix> not exactly
<DerpyMuffins> Not bad Saturn, not bad at all
<Kurra> SafariMonkey, yah it is
<Saturn> 08,01NullRadix: now, i'm addicted to procrastination
<CrimsonPhoenix> I do know it's some japanese video
<RDash5000> Kurra: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5630/
<Shizuka> 13Saturn: "i'm going to get drunk......later"
<Sumica> 00,10it was from the last ep of an anime that got cencored at it's most violent part
<NullRadix> hrm... not sure if oxymoron...
<Mistress_Rainbowdash> Saturn: But then i found ponies and that became my addiction
<Kurra> D'aww :'3
<Sumica> 00,10they cut away to a boat at sea
<Shizuka> 13ah yeah that one
<Shizuka> 13because the series was too similar to something that had just happened in japan
<DerpyMuffins> A dryer?
<Sumica> 00,10because the part in the anime resembled a reallive event that had just happend
<Kurra> Dat Transoformer toilet paper
<CrimsonPhoenix> so that's what all the fuzz is about
<SafariMonkey> Kurra: I've used a bit, I know a guy who makes carbon fiber racing seats and had a bit of a go with some spare
<sub06905> Kurra: :D
<BroPony|MEDIC|4-4808> since daylight savings ends, does this mean i get more sleep now?

<HoodyNinja> Shizuka: You don't get no washing machine
<Sumica> 00,10some one while watching the ep on a stream much like ours afer all the rage about the boat
<CrimsonPhoenix> what anime was it?
<Sumica> 00,10"it is a nice boat"
<Kimori> how goes?
<SafariMonkey> BroPony|MEDIC|4-4808: I believe that was last night?
<Kurra> SafariMonkey, I can't afford it D: I only laid up fiberglass, but hooooo Celestia's beard was it strong 8O
<BroPony|MEDIC|4-4808> SafariMonkey: .....:P
<Sumica> 00,10cant recall the shows name atm

<weeping_pegasi82> ugh I hate fish
<Mutterguy> I dunno I happily ate a seafood salad when I was 8, tentacles and all. Not that that i like octopus or squid. Just don't like the texture

<MisterSkids> i had the saddest dream this morning
<thelonepony> and then*
<Shizuka> 13i was working on a mass fab
<Kurra> at the base of every tasty food errwhere, there is pumpkin pie :>
<Shizuka> 13but that was when i decided to run a nuclear reactor in
<sub06905> so hungry :< http://delicious-cooks.com/data_images/recipes_01/amazing-real-pumpkin-pie/amazing-real-pumpkin-pie-09.jpg
<weeping_pegasi82> thelonepony: bread?

<HoodyNinja> PEE
<HoodyNinja> FUCKING
<HoodyNinja> ZA
<Kurra> eww pee.
<HoodyNinja> flutterchu: Eat the pictures?
<MisterSkids> i dreamed that i woke up with RD next to me sleeping, she was so cute i wanted to hug her, but then i realized it was just a dream, and was very sad about it
<flutterchu> *nom nom nom nom nom nom nom*
<Mutterguy> bummer. makes sense though
<sub06905> they should have flavored pictures
<HoodyNinja> MisterSkids: You should write a fic about it
<MisterSkids> now thats a good idea
<HoodyNinja> Call it "My Little Dashie"
<sub06905> HoodyNinja: :D
<Kurra> MisterSkids: that is sad, but at least you had a moment beside her, and that's all the real you ever needed then. That's still a great thing.
<weeping_pegasi82> well I had a dream that there was monster eating all of the people around me
<Mutterguy> baad hoodie!
<Shizuka> 13all this with being able to put ore into a pouch
<Shizuka> 13that teleports home
<HoodyNinja> I had a dream I died seven times
<HoodyNinja> Then turned into a kettle
<HoodyNinja> The end
<Shizuka> 13one stack goes in, two stacks come out
<MisterSkids> true Kurra at least i had one brief moments
<Kurra> If I had that dream I'd always remember what it was like to be wriggled up by Dashie.
<AVS619> i had a dream that i was at school twas horrible
<AJIsAwesome> I don't recall ever having a good dream in years. All the dreams I can really remember are sad dreams or dreams where I died. :D
<Kurra> MisterSkids changed the fundamental topic of channel
<MisterSkids> lol
<Kurra> MisterSkids wins :)
<HoodyNinja> AJIsAwesome: ...
<HoodyNinja> :D?
<Kimori> lol
<weeping_pegasi82> well my worst one was probably that my parents were killing all of their children and I was the only one left ;_;
<thelonepony> i had a Dream of a Darkness area :3
<otakon> so Shizuka what'cha doing?~
<HoodyNinja> All dese dreams
<Shizuka> 13pondering
<Kurra> All my dreams are in 7.1 surround sound with 64-bit color, and pain sensation.
<Mutterguy> mine have involved a time travelling pinkie pie.. I just wake up confused...
<sub06905> my only pony dream was about fluttershy going around selling gum and getting excited ever time she made a sale :)
<Buytoast> dreams can never become a reality you know
<flutterchu> i remember one dream where i was actually a pony, and everyone hated me
<Buytoast> they only serve as lingering reminders of what will never happen
<sub06905> every*
<HoodyNinja> Buytoast: Orly?
<twilight_sprinkle> i had three straight years of having the same nightmare every night as a kid. beat that
<MisterSkids> sounds like fluttershy sub06905
<Kurra> I remember night frights
<Saturn> 08,01i had a dream where i was on stage with KISS
<Saturn> 08,01but we all had Viols
<weeping_pegasi82> I wish my dreams would never become a reality my world would be twisted
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: Me and my best friend had the same dream on the same night, get some bitch
<Saturn> 08,01i could play the Viol, but didn't know any KISS songs
<HoodyNinja> Saturn: Oh I know this story!
<Saturn> 08,01this is largely true irl
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: i had a nightmare Of Chucky the doll for 5 years at the age of 8 :3
<Saturn> 08,01i used to play in a Viol consort, and i have no idea about KISS songs
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: dreams are a mental recombination of thoughts during the day or about a day, so if you had a similar day its not surprising
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: 5 straight years every night?
<MisterSkids> i had a night mare that i got trapped in this haunted house with no way out and the ghost killed my parents, THEN 1 year later my parents looked at this new house and bought, when i got there IT WAS THE SAME HOUSE from my dream
<thelonepony> not everynight
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: He got eaten bya zombie while playing frisbee
*Kurra dreamt a few times of ponies. Has very dim memories of crying with one, possibly because it was a dream, and was destined to end.
<MisterSkids> beat that
<twilight_sprinkle> lol HoodyNinja
<twilight_sprinkle> pfft, i have deja vu from dreams all the time, MisterSkids
<thelonepony> just twice a week sprunkls
<Mutterguy> Shizuka you saving up the water for a nuclear powerplant?
<HoodyNinja> MisterSkids: Happens to everyone
<weeping_pegasi82> well my weirdest dream included a catapult, a witch, and my brother which ended with me getting stabbed in the stomach and I actually felt it
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah, some of my life experiences have been very similar to my dreams. :D
<HoodyNinja> I knew half the answers to a test because of a dream
<HoodyNinja> Ultra hax
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: thats less than how many time i gad :P my nightmares was of a skeleton slowly walking into my room and tickiling me >.>
*Kurra had an out of body experience once, except he can't prove it was because he had foreknowledge of a hidden pice of paper he 'found' in the OOBE
<MisterSkids> there was deja vus and this was a spitting image of the house no less so strange
<sub06905> i had a dream where Scream was chasing me then when i was up agianst a corner he started singing the theme to the suite life of zack and cody. beat that :3
<flutterchu> i dreamed of my life that i could somehow never open my eyes and then once when i was at school people were telling me what the hell? are you f<_<king drunk or somthing
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: ......Suite Life of Zack and Cody? :D
<Buytoast> isn't his name Ghostface
<Buytoast> and not Scream?
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: i found what you said adorable :D
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: adorable??!
*Kurra tingles his hooves
<thelonepony> yesh :3
<Mutterguy> sub06905 flesh eating snails crawling up my legs at the age of 6
<HoodyNinja> sub06905: I was playing GoW3 and a giant grim reaper started shooting fire balls from his groin area at everything and anything they hit turned into kittens
<AJIsAwesome> ......
<AJIsAwesome> Kittens?
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: its not really adorabl if its a realistic looking skeleton..
<Afflict> I wonder why Shibaru stopped coming here
<sub06905> AJIsAwesome: yes, when i woke up i saw my bros watching the show :D
<Kurra> HoodyNinja WHAT XD
<HavokOC> Apparently, Hellsing suddenly stops at episode 13 >.<
<Saturn> 08,01i once had a dream where i was in bed celestia
<sub06905> HoodyNinja: :D
<flutterchu> ive had many dreams of the sky just dark orange with music like this playing n the backroun, then i jump off a high cliff and before i hit the ground i wake up
<MisterSkids> im actuelly started writing that dream of RD
<Kurra> O_O;
<sub06905> Saturn: o.o
<Saturn> 08,01she was warm and comforting
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: i meant say adorable in a creepy way :D
<twilight_sprinkle> ABANDON THREAD
<Kurra> do not want to hear how end. D:
<thelonepony> meant to*
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Was it that kind of dream, or just normal?
<NocturnalBlade> Saturn: i bet she would be, sun goddess and all that lol
<HoodyNinja> I pissed my bed last year because I dreamt I was using th bathroom
<Saturn> 08,01it wasn't *that* kind of dream...
*Kurra whew
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Okay. JUst making sure. Sorry.
<Saturn> 08,01it was more like she bestowed this great sense of inner peace on me
<weeping_pegasi82> I really wish I could dream about ponies all I have is freaky nightmares
<flutterchu> i dreamt of playing target smash on SSBM and when i woke up at 12:00 the gamecube turned on...is that scary?
<Saturn> 08,01stayed with me when i woke up, and i had a really good day
<NocturnalBlade> Saturn: aaaaw
<Kurra> :D
<Kimori> no idea
<Mutterguy> GO HOME SQUID! YOU'RE DRUNK!
<Sylandest> Can I ask...what song is this? and the past two?
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Lucky you.
<Kurra> also this music is epic here....
<Sylandest> They've been lovely
<twilight_sprinkle> after 2 or so years of the same nightmares, i got the ability to llucid dream, i could even wake up at will. so at some point i fought the skeleton, then went outside and it turned out there was an army of them, and i defeated them with my parents, and that nightmare never happened again. i lost the ability to llucid dream eventually too
<HoodyNinja> HOly god I found a full size snickers in my hallows eve stash
<weeping_pegasi82> Shizuka: what song is this?
<Shizuka> 13ponies figure out what the music is yet
*HoodyNinja fuck yeah
<flutterchu> one comment on youtube said that i would wake up in cum..i dont know what cum is but the next day when i woe up, i had white goo all over me
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Actually, I would like to have that dream. It would seem nice to talk to Celestia.
<HoodyNinja> Shizuka: I hear a piano, 's good enough for me
<HavokOC> DAYUM
<Shizuka> 13flutterchu: .....
<thelonepony> flutterchu: ........
<HoodyNinja> :D
<Saturn> 08,01i remember in the dream she was warm, had course fur, and smelled slightly of horse, but also of vanilla
<AJIsAwesome> ........
<HavokOC> The new Hellsing ultimate is creepier than the normal Hellsing >.<
<thelonepony> what?
*sub06905 steals the snickers from HoodyNinja :3
<weeping_pegasi82> ..............
<Saturn> 08,01fortunately, this wasn't like The Unicorn Dream
<MisterSkids> OMG this music is so sad and inspiraing its hard to write
<HoodyNinja> flutterchu: Twas ghost busters ectoplasm
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Wow......that seems like a pretty good dream.
<Shizuka> 13i have all the OSTs for Haibane Renmei in winamp atm
<flutterchu> what's that?
<Saturn> 08,01which is waaaay to horrible for this channel
*Kurra gives Saturn a swipe of Dashie scent marker. Doesn't have a Celestia flavor wit hhim
<HoodyNinja> sub06905: I still has it...
<Sylandest> Shizuka: Its beautiful...please keep playing it. :)
<HavokOC> ^
<Shizuka> 13think i need a new thing... minecraft is a bit brain heavy this late at night
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<Sumica> 00,10so what is powering alll this Shizuka?
<HavokOC> Didn't get to hear it i think :c
*Kurra thinks of his most favorite dream ever ever EVER
<HavokOC> Or is it still playing?
<HoodyNinja> Solar panels?
<twilight_sprinkle> oh my god, that reminds me of the dream my insane PE teacher told us once, its too ridiculous for chat though...damn my PE teacher was such a retard >.>
<AttackWithHugs> But if Celestia is warm in Saturn's dream...
<sub06905> HoodyNinja: i guess my hand cant reach through the internet then :<
<Shizuka> 13quantum generator, new with the latest IC2 i think
<Shizuka> 13basically infinite power source
<AttackWithHugs> If one dreamed about Luna, would she be cold?
<Sumica> 00,10magic, got it
<Shizuka> 13yep
<HoodyNinja> sub06905: AHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAA
<AttackWithHugs> You know, since she raises the moon?
<Shizuka> 13useful for prototyping
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: why would Luna be cold?
<HoodyNinja> AttackWithHugs: I don't dream about ponies...
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Misping. :)
<Sumica> 00,10I been having issues with my oil rigs exploding
<Shizuka> 13also found out it can dump enough power into a mass fab to build a stack of UU in like fice seconds
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - do you have to manage all the different tekkit mods manually or do you have a manager that updates them for you?
<Shizuka> 13all the engines are buildcraft electrical
<weeping_pegasi82> squid
<sub06905> dat squid
<Sumica> 00,10it's mostly cooling issues
<NocturnalBlade> AttackWithHugs: maybe, but thats what blankets are for ^_^
<Shizuka> 13MirrorImage: this is the Feed The Beast mod pack run through MultiMC, plus a couple extras they don't have autodownloading yet
<AttackWithHugs> Saturn, I don't know. I meant cold to the touch in a way. I guess it's just me overthinking
<Sumica> 00,10the problem with pipes decoupling on relog
<HoodyNinja> You have a um, squid in your tubes, maam
<twilight_sprinkle> ive yet to dream of ponies .-.
<Saturn> 08,01AttackWithHugs: i think Luna has a warm disposition; she's mostly just misunderstood
<Shizuka> 13squids really need better spawning algos
<Sumica> 00,10thought I would try to use a power converter to make my refinery solar
<Sumica> 00,10but dont think it works like that
<weeping_pegasi82> how do you make yourself have a dream?
<Shizuka> 13actually looks like the electrical engine is pretty cheap
<HoodyNinja> Ah, the average evening on bronystate
<AJIsAwesome> I have no idea.
<Kurra> A decade ago a childhood friend of mine died flying a plane. He drowned. v_v About 6 months later, I dreamt that I was in my old house, and my friend was there, same as ever, and we cried and said goodbye, and he said it was all right, neither of us had to griece.
<Shizuka> 13just needs tin
<flutterchu> and onetime i dreamt of walking in an endless field (the same field as the scene where the mane 6 are walking there adventure in "a rose is a rose") but it was nighttime and i see the nightmare moon logo on the moon.........i tried to go in the everfree forest up north but i couldnt see ite so i tried to run back to the oceon to find the mane 6 sleeping but they werent ther, i cried not knowing what to do
<Saturn> 08,01weeping_pegasi82: get his by a car while listening to Life on Mars
<twilight_sprinkle> weeping_pegasi82: llucid dreaming you mean? or have a dream at all?
<Sumica> 00,10not sure if there is an electric
<Sumica> 00,10in tekkit
<twilight_sprinkle> suddenly wallsplosion
<AdamTheDuck> tl;dr
<Shizuka> 13there's adjustable electrics
<weeping_pegasi82> twilight_sprinkle: have a dream at all
<Shizuka> 13like three tiers i think
<sub06905> they need to make an invention so you can record ur dreams :3
<Mutterguy> Sumica it works with tekkit, you just ned a restone torch also make sure it;'s petrol. Those explosion are kind of inconvienent
<Mutterguy> *cuombustion
<HavokOC> Vordox, i'm watching Hellsing ultimate now, incase you wanted to know ^.^
<weeping_pegasi82> Saturn: uhh what?
<Kurra> And we hugged, and he was warm and alive, and I fully believe God made the long-distance connection from the beyond to let me see him one more time. I absolutely believe that.
<AttackWithHugs> Saturn, I have no problem believing that Luna would make for a pony that could connect with you in a way.
<twilight_sprinkle> weeping_pegasi82: well i believe the more tired you are the less likely you are to have a dream
<flutterchu> another time i dreamed of BFDIA 4, but it actually wasnt how i imagined and i KNOW i was going to be wrong
<Sumica> 00,10you get enough power from a redstone toarch to run a refinner?
<AVS619> redstone engine
<twilight_sprinkle> ive dreamt of bronystate several times... i need a life >.<
<AVS619> ?
<Shizuka> 13refiner is running off the electrics over there
<Shizuka> 13ten electrics
<Shizuka> 13dunno where they rank compared to the combustion engines though
<Saturn> 08,01i had a dream about John de Lancie once
<thelonepony> but sprunkls, Bronystate IS your life :3
<Shizuka> 13probably based on input voltage, which i have at 512 from the quantum cheat generator
<Mistress_Rainbowdash> Saturn : ooohh
<twilight_sprinkle> tehlonpon D:
<Saturn> 08,01he was about the same age as he was in TNG, and we were on a train... wrestling...
<Sumica> 00,10best way to judge is to check the color of the pistons on the refiner
<Shizuka> 13redstone's just running the pumps
<MisterSkids> thats pretty epic flutterbittin
<Saturn> 08,01and that's where i'm stopping that story.
<Sumica> 00,10if green then plenty of power
<HoodyNinja> thelonepony: He just loves us so much
<Afflict> I guess she didn't love us :(
<Mutterguy> well I had to resort to combustion becaue they otheres keeped exploding once I provided power :(
<thelonepony> hoodeenija eeyup
<HoodyNinja> Saturn: He beat you, didn't he
<weeping_pegasi82> saturn: O_O
<twilight_sprinkle> i dreamt of Federer a few times, last time i was playing with him 2 vs 2, and i was extremely afraid to let him down
<HoodyNinja> Its alright, don't be ashamed
<Mutterguy> even at the the lowest voltage
<MisterSkids> my short dream storys coming along good
<Saturn> 08,01HoodyNinja: i think the "beating" was a moot point
<Kurra> Saturn http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2657/ X3
<Shizuka> 13wooden pipe is good for that
<Shizuka> 13accepts all power coming in, engines won't explode from power overload if they're into a wood pipe
<HoodyNinja> Saturn: Nope you lost, and your ashamed to admit it
<Shizuka> 13overheating from lack of cooling is a different problem though
<Mistress_Rainbowdash> Saturn : http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5796/
<Mutterguy> might be the cooling
<AttackWithHugs> I once had a dream that I was camping with two of my friends and had a fever so one of my friends held me down and stuck a centipede up my nose to keep the fever from getting any worse
<Saturn> 08,01HoodyNinja: i ended up in bed with John de Lancie. Technically, I won.
<Kurra> D8
<Shizuka> 13saw this coming
<Shizuka> 13java crash
<HoodyNinja> Saturn: Why are you ruining a perfectly good bed by wrestling in it?
<weeping_pegasi82> oh noes!
<MirrorImage> Saturn - that depends on who initiated it
<Shizuka> 13the momentum processors are pretty buggy i've found
<twilight_sprinkle> i played basketball for several years, so after i stopped playing i get occasional nightmares that im near the basket, im totally open and have the ball, nobody is near me and i just need to score an easy shot, and i end up not throwing the ball hard enough and it doesnt even make it to the basket
<Shizuka> 13probably better to use stock macerator/furnace and overclock them
<Kurra> twilight_sprinkle: gravity often does not work well in dreams
<twilight_sprinkle> Kurra: it wasnt so much gravity, i just suddenly felt very weak
<Shizuka> 13uh oh
<Kimori> aww
<HoodyNinja> I feel falling when I dream
<Kimori> dont say that
<MirrorImage> uh oh?
<Shizuka> 13crap.. those machines borked the world..
<HoodyNinja> oh uh
<MirrorImage> oh
<HoodyNinja> ho hu
<Saturn> 08,01people often speak of dreams when they are flying
<twilight_sprinkle> dayum
<HoodyNinja> hh ou
<Kimori> I noticed RedDragonX also disappeared
<Kurra> I bounced once in dreams instead of flying
*MisterSkids finishes eggnog
<J_E_Smith71> And it crashes
<Kimori> Everyones just busy these days
<weeping_pegasi82> anyone else ever feel it when there stabbed in a dream?
<Shizuka> 13btw if anyone knows where to find this in dual screen size, let me know
<Kimori> I wouldnt be on right now either if I ended up moving toda
<Sumica> 00,10what's the part number on those electrics Shizuka?
<Kimori> today
<Saturn> 08,01i had a dream, just over 10 years ago, that i was flying a helicopter
<HoodyNinja> Most of my nightmares involve me falling and being to weak to stand up
<twilight_sprinkle> heh i once had a dream of epicly fighting a anime cyborg girl
<Afflict> yeah :/
<Kurra> :D!
<J_E_Smith71> And both the chat and Minecraft crash on me at the same time
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> weeping_pegasi82: I do.
<Saturn> 08,01actually, irl, i hate flying helicopters
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: Did you get laid?
<Kurra> Crash ALL the apps!
<Saturn> 08,01freaky fucking things
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: i dont think so, i just remember she destroyed a bridge during the fight :P
<Shizuka> 13i'll check
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: Win-win
<weeping_pegasi82> AJIsAwesome|Busy: good so it isn't just me
*Kurra dreams of work often :)
<twilight_sprinkle> for some reason when i dream that im a superhero who can fly, i always have a pink trail behind me
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah I think that is a FTB only item
<Shizuka> 13almost feel like zonking out to some cosmos..
*AdamTheDuck doesn't dream enough or doesn't end up remembering which dreams he had >.>
<MisterSkids> u shouldnt eat so many pink things they make u fart like that twilight_sprinkle
<Shizuka> 13the rotary macerator is an Advanced Machines thing, technic and tekkit have it
<twilight_sprinkle> MisterSkids: i dont eat anything pink though, i dont even like gum :P
<MisterSkids> lol
<weeping_pegasi82> cow tools
<HoodyNinja> I
<HoodyNinja> Fucking
<MirrorImage> tekkit has the Rotary Mac, yes
<HoodyNinja> Love
<HoodyNinja> Gum
<MirrorImage> doesn't have the Electical Engine yet though
<Shizuka> 13it has three from Power Converters
<Shizuka> 13Buildcraft 3 now has the electrical engine in vanilla
<twilight_sprinkle> my dreams have gotten significantly more unpleasant ever since i played skyrim..
<MirrorImage> tekkit has the Engine Generators - BC --> EU/t
<MirrorImage> not the electrical engine - EU/t --> BC. still have to use energy links on that
<twilight_sprinkle> i had one absolutely disgusting dream a few months ago..
<HoodyNinja> Haven't had a dream in... months now
<HoodyNinja> I guess I'm happy
<HoodyNinja> YAY!
<twilight_sprinkle> i have a dream every night and i dont like it
<Shizuka> 13mmm no it does have a EU/t -> MJ engine in tekkit
<Shizuka> 13i used it on the last world
<twilight_sprinkle> i hate being so dim-witted in dreams
<weeping_pegasi82> I had a nightmare last night
<Kurra> NONONONO

<twilight_sprinkle> and i say heeyeahhyeahhh
<Shizuka> 13tekkit doesn't have a few of the technic mods that are/were SP only
<Shizuka> 13since tekkit is multiplayer focused
<weeping_pegasi82> I was being chased by a monster and then my dad said it was all a dream then poof! no monster in the actual dream not in real life
<MirrorImage> ah

<twilight_sprinkle> siddelthekiddel: i based it off a ytp, and i presume you saw it :$ but i just like it cause it sounds cute, no other meaning intended :D

<donutpop365> Ciao.
<HavokOC> Shizuka, I blinked
*donutpop365 Abscond.
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - windows 8?
<Shizuka> 13mac
<NocturnalBlade> that sudden volume increase
<twilight_sprinkle> i think they intended this to put the viewer to sleep and teach this to him subliminally while hes sleeping
<Shizuka> 13oh oops i'm using stereo mix..
<AttackWithHugs> fucking hell, firefox.
<twilight_sprinkle> because seriously, why would you choose such music
<Shizuka> 13moment, stereo mix is bad at this....
<Kammerjunk> Ice...
<twilight_sprinkle> use chrome
<Shizuka> 13k back on
<AttackWithHugs> twilight_sprinkle, I have Chrome but it takes FOREVER to load a page
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: I would let Carl Sagan teach me to sleep.
<NocturnalBlade> AttackWithHugs: still having problems sweetie?
<Shizuka> 13sorry, it should have been pulling from line 1, stereo mix is bad for streaming
<flutterchu> MisterSkids: YOY *clop's hoofes/paw's* WHOOHOO
<twilight_sprinkle> AttackWithHugs: thats very odd, i have 50 tabs open and its still quite fast
<MisterSkids> liked it?
<Kammerjunk> Also, my Firefox is getting slow, but that's because I have some odd hundred tabs open.
<RoseBot`> meow~
<Kammerjunk> I never close anything.
<flutterchu> MisterSkids: oh yes
<RoseBot`> i enjoy Shizukas streams :3
<MisterSkids> thx
<AttackWithHugs> twilight_sprinkle, Chrome seems to not like me. One tab takes forever to load.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: you have a hundred tabs open??
<MisterSkids> not bad for something that only took umm 20 minutes lol
<RoseBot`> Mistress_Rainbowdash, where did you go girl?
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: I used to. I have at least 175 open.
<Mutterguy> if I keep clicking refresh it'll work right? there we go
<flutterchu> MisterSkids: but im sure somebronies experiance that once every decade, EVEN I rmemember having a dream like that, so no need to act like your legendary
<RoseBot`> rawr
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: D; well that beats my record of 75 tabs, didnt think someone would beat it..
<MisterSkids> lol
<RoseBot`> only thing missing is buck rodgers
<XylemTube> only 1500 lightyears....
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: And I complain that Firefox takes my resources.

<MisterSkids> u should my monolgue or read some time
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: yeah i use chrome though, i also have a tendency to leave everything open, but i dont think my computer could handle 150 tabs
<Klumzeedragon> And Orion has no sword... He has a bow?
