<Janfadar> Just like Wickerman
<InsertCupcake> Inb4 she goes outside of Toyland
<Jigglysaint> oh don't be such a Fluttershy
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> What did Bjornfot pick? Was that the MLP movie?
<Tovler> Die Hard is more of the Christmas spirit
<Flutterz> It's filled with Nightmare Moon
<Fenr> so no demobird
<slurrymoon> Don't go into the Everfree Forest
<LunaTheForgotten> Can I have it PLZ!!!!!!!!!!!!
<ThePretender> YES TOVLAR
<happypony> big guy likes touching
*ThePretender hands LuneTheForgotten back her gun
<slurrymoon> It's dangerous
<Sumica> Like I said new rule, if they are not here to watch it we dont watch it.
<The_Si> Cookie cookie cookie.
<LunaTheForgotten> Yes!!!!!!!
<Nightshade> nope but feel free to involve The Christian Brutal Sniper, Fenr
<Nittany_Discord> We had to endure smooze and flutterponies.
<Rainbow_derp> coomunisim
<Luna> 07,1I like the suggestion Sumica
<ThePretender> agreed
<Aponymous> This is all a dream she's having while freezing to death.
<Crickettwb> Cookie communism.
<Ghosties> 04Someone
<[ger]Brony1> Spaaaaace cookies?
<Janfadar> its food or currency, not both
<happypony> I would rather swim through a mile of smooze than watch this
<InsertCupcake> edible currnecy sounds a bad idea
<Ghosties> 04Was Shosties
<LunaTheForgotten> Goodbye movie, see you in Hell!!
<Tovler> inb4 the Cookie bubble bursts
<LordCelestia> lol cookie communism
<Meanwhile> Smooze and flutterponies would've been improved with a blender.
<Jigglysaint> so the cookie factory is like a bank?
<The_Si> Cookie no money, cookie FOOD.
<The_Si> NOM NOM NOM
<riverhipp1> cookie currency? Pinkie is a millionaire
<SuperBrony64> Pssh…you need to be 21 even in Toyland for doing stuff...
<Flaria> At least smooze was interesting
<Nightshade> cookies for communists!
<fluttercry> This makes G1 ponies look like amazing cartoon
<Tovler> All the black people died from diabetes
<Jigglysaint> um
*LunaTheForgotten begins to shoot herself.
<InsertCupcake> oh shi- Is that Keanu?
<Jigglysaint> 300 years?
<Nittany_Discord> Flutterpony musk defeats smooze, though.
<happypony> >mfw I realized this was filmed in a shitty amusement park named toyland
<Crickettwb> 300 YEARS OLD!!
<ctrlx> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAJSZsZYnrE&feature=related
<happypony> it's the only explanation
*Luna takes the gun away from LunaTheForgotten
<Fenr> so,toyland proper is just the apple family barn?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no links please
<Jigglysaint> this in a town where Insulin is like gold, thanks to a cookie based economy
*LordCelestia sends Barnabe Barncale to the MOOOOOOOON
<Sumica> So luna, how many cheesecakes must i make for you to end this?
<ThePretender> I told you, shoot the movie, not yourself!
<RainbowFox> Everyone wears skates? Put in stairs.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Rollerblade bakers are best bakers.
<LordCelestia> problem solved
<ctrlx> ValtheJean, mybad
<Nightshade> LunaTheForgotten don't do it yet, you have to endure so you can say you've witnessed the worse
<Jigglysaint> oh hey, why is the Toyland economy like the real world's economy?
<LunaTheForgotten> WHY Luna! WHY must it go on..
<Meanwhile> Do you like mmmmblenders
<Creon77> lol

<ThePretender> THIS WILL MAKE US STRONGER
<Nightshade> RobotPinkie - same here
<DrActivisionary> time to spike the cookies
<LunaTheForgotten> Not even keebler elves made this movie better
<RainbowFox> I want to go into a mint now and yell "money break!"
*happypony still hasn't seen a single Babe in toyland
<Pinkieshy> I love when I come in like at a random time and have no idea what is going on
<riverhipp1> "wanna Cookie" has a whole new meaning
<[ger]Brony1> And now he shits on the cookies ..... like a BAWS?
<The_Si> From now on Intermission will be called Cookie Break.
<Janfadar> and then they stole forty cakes
<Ghosties> 04Folks, I think this may be a contender for worst film ever in Brony State
<RainbowFox> See what happens.
<Jigglysaint> actually, this movie WOuLD be better with Pinkie Pie
*Nightshade slowly losing his English class and sanity.
<Crickettwb> His evil plan involves them all getting diabeetus.
<slurrymoon> Oh yeah, listen to the obvious evil man...
<ThePretender> if we can endure this, then 4chan has no chance of stopping us
<happypony> ghosties it's easily up there
<Luna> 07,1yep I think so too
<LunaTheForgotten> Ghosties,I agree
<kirzstryfe> cookie embezzlement
<Darken_Skye> No the pig movie has this beat hands down
<happypony> this is BFE levels of unwatchable
<Luna> 07,1this beats spider's web!
<Zephirdd> Ghosties: MLP?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, true...
<InsertCupcake> I get in from a night drinking to this...
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Oh hell no.
<[ger]Brony1> forty cakes? That's like four times ten cakes! That's terrible!
<Zephirdd> (I'm not watching btw)
<Sumica> So are they robbing the place or staving the people?
<happypony> what's our best movie?
<LunaTheForgotten> Can I have my gun back now Luna? PLZ
<happypony> my vote is for DS2
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Spiders Web was beyond horrendous. It is unspeakable.
<Aponymous> Ultimate Drinking Game: While watching Babes in Toyland, take a shot every time something stupid happens.
<Tovler> huhuh... what?
<Fenr> they are doing both
<Nightshade> This film didn't beat my spider situation Luna why didn't it?!
<happypony> followed by True Romance
<slurrymoon> >Carefully sets cake in box
<Meanwhile> Man that guy owns and hitting cake with a stick
<Ghosties> 04MLP wasn't that bad
<Nittany_Discord> Oh good, everyone leaves so they can steal. The villain declaring a lunch break is very unsupicious.
<Ghosties> 04But THIS
<ValtheJean> 2,14 dude, DS2 was awesome
<slurrymoon> >Drops Box
<RobotPinkie> 06,15THPS is our best movie, of course....
<Tovler> I don't know how to riff this
*Luna hugs LunaTheForgotten sorry dear.. we have to sit through it both..

<ThePretender> DS2?
*Nightshade hugs both the luna's
<InsertCupcake> why dont they just burn it?

<Creon77> Why do i get the feeling that everypony who worked on this movie hated themsevles?
<Meanwhile> Don't worry Luna, have a blender.

<ValtheJean> 2,14 RHPS rivals for the BEST movie shown on BMN :P

<Luna> 07,1I don't know.. this is evil Discord magic
<RainbowFox> Creon, that's because they did.
<DragonRage> Some cookies. I'LL STEAL THEM! NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW!
<happypony> DS2 had everything: stupidity, boobs, a hilarious script, more boobs, and THAT SOUND
<Nightshade> no this iis a C movie!
*ThePretender stands defiantly against the horros of this movie. JOIN ME BRONIES, WE SHALL ENDURE
<Creon77> lol
<Ghosties> 04DS2 was a good film
<Jigglysaint> C for Cookies that is
<Nittany_Discord> Will it blend...time warp?
<Luna> 07,1this is a ZZZZZ movie
<LunaTheForgotten> I remember who picked it.
<The_Si> CONFOUND THAT LISA
<Ghosties> 04It had everything a guy would love
<Aponymous> DS2 was amazing
<LunaTheForgotten> But I won;t say

<RobotPinkie> 06,15Black Dynamite is best A movie
<Zephirdd> o_o
<Ghosties> 04Evil Dead II is best film shown so far
<slurrymoon> Black Dynamite was hilarious

<Aponymous> My favorite A movie is True Romance.[/bias]
<Luna> 07,1all wrong

<Luna> 07,1RHPS was
<Nightshade> We need Dogma on one week

<ValtheJean> Evil Dead II is a classic
<Fenr> soooooooooo many children...want some?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15:P
<LordCelestia> I CANT FREAKIN STAND ANY MORE OF THIS. I'll be on my ps3 for the next half hour or so.
<Nittany_Discord> Black Dynamite was fun.
<Meanwhile> So much old mother hubbard sex.
<slurrymoon> I especially liked the animated series on Adult Swim.
<LunaTheForgotten> God,These names!!!!
<ThePretender> WHY DO I MISS ALL THESE GOOD MOVIES
<InsertCupcake> What I saw of True Romance i liked
<Tovler> Black Dynamite was better than that week's A movie (Jaws)
<Meanwhile> I forget my kids names
<Ghosties> 04Se7en
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Luna picked RHPS, so it MUST be best movie.
<Crickettwb> Lol, teacher owned
<Aponymous> Tovler: Agreed
<Meanwhile> But you'll figure it out
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> If I get picked, I may have to go with Death Bed: The Bed That Eats People
*Luna nods
<RainbowFox> Your mother doesn't love you. NOW WHAT.
<LordCelestia> 100 rules of the internets
<Nittany_Discord> Se7en/Charlotte's web. My first night.
<happypony> evil dead iii is a classic
*VioletVanilla nods
<LunaTheForgotten> You all watched Se7en
<happypony> but DS2 was a gem
<Luna> 07,1yep
<Ghosties> 04Se7en is best A film
<Ghosties> 04Easily
<happypony> death bed, boy, that's a snoozer
<The_Si> You shoulda married him, now he's a cookie thief.
<LunaTheForgotten> Damn it!
<Nittany_Discord> What about Inception?
<ThePretender> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
<The_Si> The worst klind of thief.
<Rainbow_derp> Rotten tomamtoes gave it a 48%
<LunaTheForgotten> I love that movie!
<The_Si> *kind
<Meanwhile> Evil dead is the one where Bruce cambell puts a blender on his arm right?
<LordCelestia> Number 34. There is naughty things about it. Period.
<Tovler> I couldn't riff Se7en. I had to watch it full screen.
<happypony> A MATOOR MAN
<Sumica> man, I just realised how bad the toot spam must have been for those in the new chat.
<Tovler> Ma-tour
<LunaTheForgotten> It's the complete oppisite of this movie.
<Nittany_Discord> Se7en was great, though.
<happypony> lawl new chat
<Ghosties> 04"Wanting people's attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer. And then you'll notice you've got their strict attention" - John Doe
<happypony> mibbit, mibbit
<ThePretender> has Spaceballs been aired here?
<Meanwhile> Se7en was the one with the blender in the box right?
<happypony> we should have a mel brooks night sometime
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ehhh, probably the A-movie I enjoyed the most was Across the Universe, but if I say that I will get kicked from the channel. :P
<Luna> 07,1ThePretender not yet
<ThePretender> YES HAPPYPONY
<CosmicChan_> so slavery?
<happypony> Producers-Spaceballs-History of the world
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Se7en was great. I think that may have been my favorite A movie.
<RainBroDash> 10RobotPinkie, h8rz gonna h8
<Jigglysaint> I just want to torture everbody with Barney
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<ThePretender> ah, Across the Universe

<InsertCupcake> so nifty
<Ghosties> 04Oh...

<RainBroDash> 10Haters be hating. I liked across the universe.
<Ghosties> 04"That" film
<The_Si> Eddie Izzard was the best bit.
<ThePretender> where we all NANANANANA'D, and Ghosties was mad
<Nittany_Discord> Ahh, the other Beatles movie.
<Crickettwb> Across the Universe is legit. Wasn't watching bronystate at that time though. Sadface
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lawl
<Fenr> economy that runs on sweets...
<Rainbow_derp> you guys say 34 but I say rule 34D
<LunaTheForgotten> If I won the lottery, I would pick Stranger Than Fiction.
<Nittany_Discord> We need to see The Wall.
<happypony> that car noise
*Ghosties refuses to talk about "that" film
<happypony> why
<Nittany_Discord> If we're going to watch movies based on bands.
<Meanwhile> If i won the lottery we'd be watching footage of blenders.
<lordpie> lol
<Nightshade> why has nopony picked Dogma yet?
<Tovler> This movie if full of larded scenes.
<Ghosties> 04But I like the idea of a Mel Brooks night
<Luna> 07,1we need to see LABYRINTH
<Flutterz> We need to watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
<happypony> these cars run on bubbles
<The_Si> I'd rather watch an actual wall now.
<Aponymous> Across the Universe was the best musical we watched.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pffft, Ghosties has no taste
<Jigglysaint> yeah
<Sumica> Yes Luna
<ThePretender> Dogma ftw
<Jigglysaint> heck yeah
<LunaTheForgotten> Luna,Hell yea

<Ghosties> 04All great films, though Dracula gets my vote out of those three
<SirSprinkles> 6...what the hell are they talking about?
<Rainbow_derp> If i win the a movie I'd pick Screamers (1995)
<Aponymous> Nittany_Discord: Oh god...
<ThePretender> I loooooved Dracula: Dead and Loving It as a kid
<happypony> and then for lulz we could pick Elephant Man
<happypony> because brooks did that too
<Nittany_Discord> DERPDERPDERPDERP: The Justin Beiber flick.
<Nightshade> Here here ThePretender
<RainbowFox> Luna sheds a single tear.

<Aponymous> Across the Universe was okay, the plot at the beginning was paper thin though.
<GGgale> >silent hill. 'film'. NO

<Meanwhile> Barnaby Barnacle head.

<Rainbow_derp> wtf?
<InsertCupcake> how can you drive up the price of a currency?
<Fenr> they arent using real economics on coockies,right?
<Crickettwb> I sense an underlying political statement.
<Nightshade> OBJECTION
<Aponymous> Beatles songs helped it.
<Randall116> COOKIES FOR A CURRRENCY? WHAT NIGHTMARE IS THIS?!
<LunaTheForgotten> Let's gooooooooooooooooo
*ThePretender skips to the gun store.
<happypony> this movie is an elaborate metaphor for the holocaust
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Keanu Reeves took 40 cakes!
<pony_7174> will there be
<Nightshade> OBJECTION!
<The_Si> This is a very political movie.
*LunaTheForgotten hops in her car
<pony_7174> episode 2 tonight
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, yeah, without the Beatles songs it would have been... I don't even know.
<Meanwhile> Justice Grim is getting a blender for christmas.

<Nittany_Discord> Toyland is a Capitalist state?
<LunaTheForgotten> Hop in everypony!!
<Tovler> U LYING I NEVER LOST THEM
<Crickettwb> Yeah, it would have sucked.
<Creon77> These actors are just blowing me away with their line delivery
<InsertCupcake> but cookie sare persihiable anyway so a million cookies going missing is like a weeks pay or something?
*Nightshade hops in
<Lagmobile> and thats horrible!
<Randall116> capitialism = bad

<pony_7174> will there be a season 2 episode 2 tomorrow?
<Janfadar> hes also being sued for abuse of cookie breaks
<happypony> NOT ENUFF
<Randall116> NOOOOOOOOOO
<Aponymous> Seriously, I've seen a lot of Keanu movies where I THOUGHT "Wow, he doesn't give a shit" but this movie, I KNOW he doesn't give a shit.
<SuperBrony64> oMG Hand cuffs lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pretty much, Crickettwb!

<DERPDERPDERPDERP> ...oh good god
<ThePretender> I love this judicial system
<Randall116> NO TRIAL?
<Randall116> WTFD IS THIS?
*LunaTheForgotten buys a brand new pistoll
<Fenr> TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOON
<RainbowFox> You can really see the emotion.
<Nittany_Discord> Capitalism sucks much, but there aren't many other alternatives.
*Nightshade buys a jetpack and a giant hammer
<Rainbow_derp> can I post shipping in this dire time?
<LunaTheForgotten> YOU WON'T TAKE THIS ONE!!!!HAHAHAHA
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Suspicion on the grounds of lack of evidence...yeah...that makes sense
*ThePretender buys a Winchester repeater!
<Nittany_Discord> Unless a mid-spectrum economy.
<RainbowFox> They're really getting into the roles.
<happypony> SONG
*LunaTheForgotten aims the pistol.
<Sumica> oh no
<Fenr> and song time comes
<slurrymoon> song?
<Tovler> The Economy Brazil has is better.
<Meanwhile> Urrrr
<Sumica> nooo
<The_Si> All you had to do was follow the damn cookie, Jack.
<ThePretender> because I keep it cowboy-ish
<Crickettwb> GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENCE, MOTHER FRACKER!
<Randall1160> my ranting got the better of me LOL

<RainbowFox> SUDDENLY HAPPY MUSIC
<Jigglysaint> this song would be awesome if ponies sang it, don't lie
<Fenr> give us back the smooze song please
*ThePretender activates Dead-Eye level 3.
<Rainbow_derp> just say the word mods
<LunaTheForgotten> This song makes me want to pull the trigger more
<SuperBrony64> OMG, my parents are telling me they heard of this movie before (this isn't the original)
<gingerbrony666> Is the stream on? I can't see anything
<Luna> 07,1without a gun?
<lordpie> :/
<Lagmobile> singing? in MY christmas movie?
<Nittany_Discord> Trust the guy in black! Trust the mean guy! He's never wrong!
*happypony remembers this is all a hallucination lisa is having after concussing herself on a tree and falling into a coma
<kirzstryfe> you're not missing anything important
<SuperBrony64> The original is in Black and White.
<Sumica> can we just cut back to the girl in a coma?
<Aponymous> Horror movie directors should watch this. It'll teach them how to make something that's actually terrifying.
<ValtheJean> I still say use the soundboard, make an exception just this once :P
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Consider yourself lucky, gingerbrony666
<Tovler> Ponies make any song better
*Nightshade must blow self up jetpack why you no KABOOM?!
<Rainbow_derp> this a remake?
<Lagmobile> Its more likely the you think
<Meanwhile> LunaTheForgotten forget the gun, have a blender.
<Crickettwb> Jigglysaint, I wonder if this movie would be awesome if it was a pony movie.
<Randall1160> ginerbrony666 switch to low quality if you cant see anything
<happypony> it wouldn't be
*Nightshade realises his jetpack is hammerproof
<Crickettwb> It would be 20% cooler.
<happypony> a JAILBREAK! YAHOO!

<LunaTheForgotten> This gun I hav....oh. Damn it!
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> A jailbreak! Yipee!

<ThePretender> I still have my gun!
<Randall1160> OH TEH NOES
<Fenr> this one is 1986,there is another one from 1961
<Nittany_Discord> Girl's not in a coma. There was a nuclear war and she happened to jump through some dimensions.
<Crickettwb> That totally will work.
<Aponymous> That was hilarious.
<Jigglysaint> Jailbait!
<The_Si> I'LL STEAL IT NOONE WIL-wait what
<Sumica> yes jail break much better then finding out the true robber.
<Turtaguin> what would happen if someone brought a gu to toyland?

<Flutterz> Jailbreak != sex
<gingerbrony666> It didn't work. The screen just says: The Broadcast is offline, even if I switch to low quality

<LunaTheForgotten> This is pretty grimdark.
<Crickettwb> Bird is resentful for Barnaby telling him he'd grow up to be beautiful, obviously.
<happypony> that's just sick
<Patrtap> And that was on my first Brony Movie Night.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Did Santa just suggest they poke its eye out
<Sumica> what blinding it was't enough?
<Meanwhile> And stay in there you eyeball bastard
<LordCelestia> PUSH IT IN THERE
<Flutterz> next thing you know they'll bury him alive
<Aponymous> our heroes!
<Flutterz> and set fire to him
<Euponytor> it was supposedly attacking them
<slurrymoon> That bird's got one serious Black Eye.
<happypony> they're going to release it into the wild, blinded
<Dumori> yeah

<Jigglysaint> Look for Barnaby as the villian for Season 3 of Friendship is Magic
*LunaTheForgotten 's eyes begin to cry blood.
<GGgale> we all know this movie will be the death of us by now
<LordCelestia> HELL NO
<LordCelestia> HAY NO
<Dumori> I'm out
<Lagmobile> this looks like a surreal marillyn manson video
<slurrymoon> This movie is actually propaganda by Bronystate to show us what Equestria would be like if Discord is not defeated.
<Dumori> Need pre season 2 sleep
<Tovler> WAYNE'S WOOOOOORLD
<Rainbow_derp> even orgieporgy is board

<Dumori> this is just tyhat BAD
<LordCelestia> Bye Dumori
<LunaTheForgotten> My EYES!!! My EARS!!! They BLEED!
<Meanwhile> If Barnaby Barnacle shows up in season 3 i will step into my computer screen and blend his face off.
<CircuitMane> At least A pig's tale was short! This is long and painful
<Drunklestia> What the hell is even augh
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> See ya
<Fenr> now,on to clubbing the bear!
<Euponytor> I know it might be difficult to detect sarcasm online, but there are other clues you can use to tell if someone is being tongue in cheek
<Dumori> no I won't wimp out
<happypony> "well I guess since you had a song I can't argue with that."
<Drunklestia> I'm not drunk enough for thi
<Dumori> damn it

<Drunklestia> I've got four people playing L4D in the room, so I'm a little distracted
<Blendtec> why hasn't keanu defeated the robits yet?
<Aponymous> It brings a tear to my eyes.
*ThePretender hopes there's like 15 minutes left
<Tovler> Even in California, is there enough pot for this?
<Fenr> we miss word to exactly say how bad it is
<Euponytor> so he's been sitting there feeling her up this whole time?
<Lagmobile> lol
<Darf14> Soon......
<GGgale> XD
<Sumica> just open the damn bong of evil already!
<LordCelestia> Feel the power
<Drunklestia> I'M IN CANADA, THE CAPITAL OF POT, AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH POT FOR THIS
<AnonZach> Yup. He doesn't really have much else to do.
<CircuitMane> We'll conquer a land populated by bears and with a cookie currency
<Lagmobile> how much longer will we have to endure this torture?
<Fenr> *says the man trapped like an idiot*
<Drunklestia> What's after this?
<Meanwhile> You probably thought that Barnaby Barnacle was an evil idiot. Nope, Chuck Testa.
<Darf14> He should of panic
<AnonZach> No. We can totally panic. See? AAAAAIEEEEEEE!
<Tovler> This is harder than playing through Epic Mickey.
<Thunder_Dash> Oh holy /shit/, I need to get rid of my Fraps folder soon
<LunaTheForgotten> It will never END!!
<Lagmobile> Thats it im out
<Sumica> slenderponies

<Lagmobile> and over and over on purpose...
<Darf14> Drive me closer! I want to hit them with my pink bat!
<Dumori> Who picked this
<GGgale> Discord, probably.
<Dumori> mob justice time I think
<Lagmobile> just keep crashing
<Dumori> ...
<Crickettwb> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDGEMUFFIN this movie sucks
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I don't know...but they are no longer welcome here

<Meanwhile> Arms being ripped off everywhere

<dumbasspony> they did blind his pet and lock it in a cabinet
<Meanwhile> Heads being devoured
<ThePretender> The dreams of the bronies we left behind, and the ones of the bronies that are yet to come wind together in a double helix, forging a path to Season 2!
<LunaTheForgotten> I can now watch this movie with no pain.
<Drunklestia> I'm not high ENOUGH to understand this
*Aponymous likes how the amount of viewers has been dropping throughout the movie.
<Meanwhile> That little girl get's all her limbs pulled off by a train
<Meanwhile> wishful thinking.
<Rainbow_derp> I'm out at midnight end of movie or not.
<Dumori> And dump it un the woods
<Cobalt> I /will/ make it all the way through this movie
<Darf14> I wonder what Mcguffin they will use to save the day?
<Tovler> whoa... what was that?
<slurrymoon> PPG are here?
*Turtaguin thinks he would have to be on at least two drugs to understand and follow this
<dumbasspony> lol cincywhatski
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ......he just involved the awesomeness in PPG to this abomination
<Fenr> the power of love

<Tovler> A 300 lb Genius
<Drunklestia> But Tovler, PPGZ is tarbl
<Darf14> PPGZ?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 why would there be a marathon?
<Drunklestia> Power Puff Girls Z
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the marathon was last week
<Drunklestia> The PPG anime
<Tovler> PPGZ is PPG and that's all that matters to me
<Lagmobile> What about PSG?
<Meanwhile> PPGZ, that was a silly, silly invention.
<LunaTheForgotten> I can't believe it's still on.
<ThePretender> PSG was awesome
<Darf14> Wow...didnt know that the PPG had an anime version
<Natleyn> There's another website doing a mareathon.
<Drunklestia> PSG is awesome though
<Euponytor> I like how he tosses the vine back to him
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Be an hero Georgie
<Natleyn> ^what
<Euponytor> instead of going double like with the girls

<Meanwhile> YOU CAN DO IT CHUNK
<Lagmobile> Panty and Stocking w/ Garterbelt
<CircuitMane> your fat won't break the vine, we promise
<Drunklestia> I hope they make a season 2 of PSG
<Tovler> PSG has that scorched earth ending. Who does that?!! *Gainax*
<Thunder_Dash> > mfw look back at chat and see "be an hero"
<ThePretender> same
<Drunklestia> But there probably won't be
<AnonZach> It's just a hop skip and a jump!
<Drunklestia> Ever
<Drunklestia> It's going to be a one season wonder
*LunaTheForgotten brohoofs Meanwhile.The Goonies
<ThePretender> but there's a poster promoting a season 2
<Lagmobile> Its called a gainax ending for a reaso :P
<Drunklestia> There is
<lonelypony> nopony knoooows the trouble I seen
*ThePretender does the Truffle Shuffle.
<Drunklestia> But it's from February
<lonelypony> nopony knooooows but Jesus
<Euponytor> follow a girl in a dress up a ladder
<Meanwhile> The Goonies was amazing. This on the other hand is a deep fried spunk lollypop.
<Tovler> This new pony season seems wrong without PSG
<LunaTheForgotten> We need some Goonies up in here.
<Nittany_Discord> Didn't that door lead to a tube?
<Lagmobile> fuck this movie
<Meanwhile> intermission
<Creon77> Thatll hold em!
<Lagmobile> playing burnout
<Nittany_Discord> PSG?
<LordCelestia> WHY IN EQUESTRIA is this movie named "Babes in Toyland"?? There is only 1 babe, a little girl, and an old hag.
<Aponymous> AND I THINK ITS GONNA BE A LONG LONG TIME
<Darf14> Oh come on! The villians will have an easier time getting to Santa if they go that way!....dang plot
<Tovler> I want Notepad back.
<lonelypony> nopony knooooows
<ThePretender> all Iknow is that I need more RRRRUUUURRRUUUUU in my life
<Drunklestia> MLP and PSG just seem so similar to me
<Aponymous> BEFORE TOUCHDOWN BRINGS ME 'ROUND AGAIN TO FIND
<Rainbow_derp> dat plot
<Drunklestia> Maybe it's because I'm drunk
<AnonZach> Turned over table with an empty barrel. Stops army of trolls.
<Drunklestia> But they just seem similar
<ThePretender> I'M A ROCKET MAN
<lonelypony> man those cars are utterly ridiculous
<Tovler> Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was slow, but this is a whole nother level
<LordCelestia> ugh
<Euponytor> Little 5 mph bubble cars.
<Crickettwb> HEEEEEEEERRREEE AM I SITTING IN A TIN CAAN
<Euponytor> PERFECT transportation.
<Aponymous> I HATE those cars.
<Lagmobile> One is a parody of Lauren Fausts work the other is actually Lauren Fausts work :P
<gingerbrony666> What happened last week btw? During the premiere. The stream kinda crashed
<LunaTheForgotten> Why can't it just die?
<Crickettwb> FAAAAARR ABOVE THE MOOON
<Drunklestia> Ahhhhhhhhhh
<Pontang> Did someone just compare MLP:FiM to PSG?
<Pontang> D:
<Pontang> WHY?
<AnonZach> They'd go faster if they'd lay off the cookies.
<Drunklestia> I would so dig a PSG parody of MLP
<Meanwhile> Pimpsmack
<Thunder_Dash> Man, it's been years since I saw Chitty Chitty Bang Bang too... Internet, y u make me feel so nostalgic?
*Pontang shudders
<Lagmobile> cuz theres so many similarities
<Tovler> PSG had epic Background music.
<Fenr> twilight cars!
<LunaTheForgotten> I'll kick their ass!
<ThePretender> agreed, Drunklestia
<Aponymous> He was being SUBTLE?
<Pontang> The only thing PSG had going for it was the music.
<Pontang> o_o
<Euponytor> this guy is not a credible villain for some reason
<Dumori> So slow
<Drunklestia> If there was an S2 of PSG there'd probably be one
<LunaTheForgotten> Epic chase scene is a go
<AnonZach> Best. Chase Scene. Ever.
<Pontang> I hope not.
<Aponymous> It's hard to take a villain seriously in a car like that.
<CircuitMane> Wow, even the chase scene sucks
<Lagmobile> Chuck and Spike both got messages from higher powers
<Luna> 07,1this is epic?
<Dumori> Have to laught
<Rainbow_derp> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/deba64f2ce15c3ebb1eb48bf15054ae0/62549%20-%20pinkie_pie%20pole%20rainbow_dash%20scootalick%20scootaloo%20stuck%20stuckaloo%20tongue.png
<CosmicChan_> i loved PSG
<Drunklestia> But I don't thing MLP airs in Japan
<ThePretender> Toyland Kart!
<Darf14> Mario Kart, Not released version!
<LordCelestia> he wants her
<Pontang> I hated it.
<Pontang> :3
<Lagmobile> WOO BUMPER CARS!
<Tovler> PSG had a transformers Parody. Season 2 could've had a MLP parody
<LordCelestia> He wants a little one.
<Rainbow_derp> pedo much?
<LunaTheForgotten> Epic chase scene has failed miserably
<Dumori> It's that or maiming my self.
<CosmicChan_> i hope PSG makes another season =p
<slurrymoon> GET IN MA BELLY!
<Lagmobile> WOO BUMPAH CARS!
<Pontang> One of the worst series I've watched.
<Pontang> :x
<Creon77> Hey guys i have an idea
<Creon77> what if the climax for this movie
<Darf14> :D
<Fenr> oh come on
<Lagmobile> Its a widget series
<LordCelestia> "I'll get you you fat f**k!"
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> This is probably a really dumb question, but... what show is this PSG?
<Rainbow_derp> he needs more leverage
<gingerbrony666> At least it's somewhat entertaining
<Creon77> was a bumper car deathmatch?
<Meanwhile> Where did this film get the funding for this shit?
<Fenr> running on the spot car chase scene?
<Tovler> ...
<Drunklestia> Panty and Stocking
<AnonZach> I'm waiting for the track manager to come out and say, "Hey! No bumping!"
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Ah.
<ThePretender> with Garterbelt
<LunaTheForgotten> Best....Chase....Scene....Never....
<Crickettwb> I second derpderpderpderp
<Creon77> except, no one ever bumpos
<Cobalt> BAIL
<Drunklestia> It's an anime that's styled a lot like cartoons
<Creon77> *bumps
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Okay. I've heard of that, never saw it though.
<Tovler> Now I want to play Putt-putt and Pep's Balloon-o-rama
<lonelypony> owned by a tree
<GabeMoist> lol
<Drunklestia> It's all parodies of popular cartoons
<Lagmobile> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEpy0znKHWs
<Darf14> I bet this film bombed! RUSSIAN STYLE!
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> That's the one with the girl who looks like twilight?
<Pontang> Music and animation style, I liked it.
<Rainbow_derp> were do you watch PSG?
<Drunklestia> Yeah, that one
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no video links please
<GabeMoist> Beat up by Fluttershy
<Pontang> Otherwise, the humor was too blunt for my tastes.

<Fenr> the troll army is maybe the best looking thing of the movie
<Tovler> wait they're trees
<Drunklestia> I used to have a link to all the PSG episodes on megaupload
<Fenr> that says a lot
*Pontang goes back to the 80s.
<Lagmobile> Lets all forget this movie and talk about psg, agreed?
<Natleyn> Sculptures you say
<Pontang> No
<Pontang> :x
<Drunklestia> But unfortuately this is September
<Meanwhile> I'm an old man
<Meanwhile> Leave me alone
<slurrymoon> Those Discords are nice
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> They sort of look like really bad cosplays of the tree warriors from LOTR
<Drunklestia> and not December '10
<herospirit> Lol XD
<Aponymous> PSG is crazy, enjoyable, but crazy.
<AnonZach> Toymaster says,"Meh."
<Pontang> Lolol
<Darf14> Santa! The useless man in the world!
<Nittany_Discord> Don't know about PSG.
<Tovler> That Chocolat song on PSG made me cry gurly tears
<Euponytor> toymaster is a stoner
<lonelypony> that's the moral
<LunaTheForgotten> YOU!!!!
<lonelypony> THAT'S THE MORAL
<Rookeealding> the audiance.
<Lagmobile> like man
<lonelypony> believe in toys
<Drunklestia> The soundtrack is awesome, Tovler
<Meanwhile> Dumb eleven year old.
<Natleyn> Tovler: Huh.
<Edward_Newgate> Asian Santa...
<AnonZach> Toymaster is a zen master.
<lonelypony> are you fucking kidding me
<Lagmobile> like a man*
<Rookeealding> the fight guy is thinking it's him...
<CircuitMane> oh my god, this was 2 and a half hours to get to this?!
<Natleyn> Soundtrack is pretty cool.
<LunaTheForgotten> Damn it Lisa
<Edward_Newgate> ...so awkward
<Aponymous> Theres a fucking moral to this?
<Euponytor> I thought I saw a bug walking around on his hat
<Fenr> oh,the "be a child,dont ask to be an adult too soon" morale
<AnonZach> Nope. It's you Georgie.
<ThePretender> I got my ex into PSG. Lo and behold, she turns out to be more like Panty than I thought.
<Darf14> Toys are real, someone smack those kids
<slurrymoon> Is the Toymaster analagous to the Wizard of Oz?
<Euponytor> no, Georgie is a manchild
<Thunder_Dash> "Life made her grow too fast" What are you talking about, I'm a boy, not a girl. I'm not even in this film either.
<Fenr> kind of missed it so far
<Lagmobile> Loved garterbelts back in time music
<AnonZach> He's just bigboned, guys. Come on.
<slurrymoon> This scene feels like the ending of The Wizard of Oz.
<Tovler> dat voice crack

<Rohirrim> Is he driving wooden reigndeer?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 right after this ;)
<Euponytor> dat superimposed
<kirzstryfe> start of the movie was close to christmas
<DeadlyBrony> So remember kids: Always act like a child, and you shall NEVER grow old! No matter what people say, just keep believing in a fictional land, and you will never die
<Meanwhile> I could never hate christmas, but damn this is making it difficult.
*Tovler is being affected/manipulated by this ending *cries*

*Natleyn is laughing
<Tovler> Fake ending #3
<LunaTheForgotten> Now I can say I sat through the worst movie ever
<CircuitMane> going on for 100 years
<lonelypony> this time was the worst though
<Sumica> oh turns out she's brain dead in a coma
<Ghosties> 04Why would Santa petrify his reindeer?!
<DeadlyBrony> Wow
<Fenr> not even in a coma?just asleep on the couch?
<AnonZach> I missed the start of the movie. I came in when Barrymore was using her feminine wiles to distract the judge.
<Dumori> Lol
<Ghosties> 04That's just not right!
<mib_w8047x> is there a stream going on now? both broadcasts say offline for me
<Dumori> Why b&
<Rainbow_derp> r34D if it exisits it's porn to somebody
<Rohirrim> THIS WAS A COMA?
<lonelypony> because I had about thirty posts inbetween my one and the one that got me kicked
<Darf14> It was all a dream.......whhhaaaaAAAAATTTT!!!*BOOM*
<Thunder_Dash> Jesus, I figured clawing out my throat would fix the problem, but... What the hell.
<DeadlyBrony> This film really doesn't capture anything christmasy
<Ghosties> 04AND YOU WERE THERE, AND YOU WERE THERE, AND YOU WERE THERE
<Meanwhile> Attack of the Giant Crab Monsters is better than this.
*Natleyn hugs Meanwhile
<LunaTheForgotten> See,I was right
<Aponymous> Fuck, it didn't end with her dying in the middle of the woods.
<CircuitMane> Wait...no doctor?
<lonelypony> and I have screens to prove it
<AnonZach> Now get back in the kitchen.
<LordCelestia> Wait, theyre the SAME ACTORS
<CircuitMane> What the hell
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the fuck....she was in a coma and they put her on the COUCH?
<lonelypony> well, more like a dozen
<DeadlyBrony> AND YOU
<lonelypony> but still
<DeadlyBrony> AND YOU AUNTIE AM!
<Tovler> And you were there...
<Tovler> AND YOU
<Lagmobile> yes what did you want r34 of anyway?
<Natleyn> ValtheJean: QUESTION NOTHING
<GGgale> i'm telling ya the script is crazy
<Sumica> oh good, she fell out of the jeep and they just took her home instead of to a hosptal.
<CircuitMane> My little girl was in trouble, so let's let her lay on the couch
<GabeMoist> AND YOU WERE THERE TOO
<CloudRunner> I hope Luna joins the fluttershy channel when the ponies start
<Wanderlust> IT WAS ALL A DREAM
<DeadlyBrony> WAit...THIS IS STOLEN FROM OZ!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 NO MORE R34 talking
<Tovler> and Fursuits
<Turtaguin> WIZARD OF FUCKING OZ REMAKE
<Rohirrim> The PS3 was in the bedroom, ValtheJean
<Ghosties> 04Jesus, what a blatant fucking rip off of Wizard of Oz
<Darf14> This is a rip off of OZ!
<LunaTheForgotten> You know what....FUCK YOU MOVIE!!!!!!
<Turtaguin> LUKE SKYWALKER?
<Rainbow_derp> *cof*rip off*cof*
<DeadlyBrony> HUHUHUHUHUHUH
<CloudRunner> right now Luna is in the bronystate channel.
<Lagmobile> Im playing ps3 right now :P
<CircuitMane> So she'll call an exterminator, but not a doctor?!
<Sumica> called that from the start Ghosties
<Aponymous> It's Wizard of Oz, except it's even worse.
<Rohirrim> No wonder this is a B movie >_>
<ThePretender> I'LL KILL YOU MOVIE
<Turtaguin> WIZARD OF FUCKING OZ
<CircuitMane> What the hell is wrong with this lady?!
<Fenr> we are the unlucky ones i guess
<Lagmobile> psn anybody?
<Natleyn> This isn't B
<GabeMoist> He's asian too
<Natleyn> This is deadly
<ValtheJean> 2,14 luna is here :P

<Natleyn> USE THIS INSTEAD OF WATERBOARDING
<Natleyn> PLEASE
<Meanwhile> Now shush
<AnonZach> I've missed so much.
<DeadlyBrony> NO PLACE LIKE HOME, NO PLACE LIKE HOME
<slurrymoon> I wish you all could have met the Wizard of Oz.
*ThePretender will kill this movie to death!
<kirzstryfe> keanu drove through a blizzard and she got thrown out the back of his jeep
<Ghosties> 04Seriously, I may have hated this film but I downright despise the utter atrocity it committed of ripping off a much, MUCH better film
<Fenr> it is B
<Dumori> This is god damn z
<Flameshy> Hi Luna :)
<DeadlyBrony> Wait
<Darf14> This is below a B movie, it deserves a new catagory! Its a C mov- *punched*
<DeadlyBrony> Flying out from the jeep?
<Nittany_Discord> Nice hallucination!
<DeadlyBrony> Is she dead?
<Tovler> Damn, this soundtrack is manipulating me.
<Fenr> Bjust,the B in NBC danger
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> The length is what really destroyed my mind
<GGgale> Z-list movie
<GabeMoist> Better than you guys
*LunaTheForgotten begins to beat up the movie
<Creon77> oh gosh
<Sumica> you gell out of the car and smashed your head, good thing you are fine.
<CircuitMane> This ending makes no sense?!
<LunaTheForgotten> DIE!!!
<Ghosties> 04JUST SHUT UP
<Aponymous> This isn't a B Movie, it's a shit movie
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no, it's a B movie, B for "BURN IT TO THE GROUND"
<Creon77> my song senses are tingling
<DeadlyBrony> OH SHUT UP! We get it! There is no place like home!
<Ghosties> 04SHUT UP
<Ghosties> 04SHUT UP
<Ghosties> 04SHUT UP
<GabeMoist> Then they all died
<Thunder_Dash> I think I'm going to pass out if this goes on much longer, and I'm not even listening to it anymore
*Rohirrim retract his fist from Darf14's cheek whilist grumbling.
<Ghosties> 04SHUT UP
<Meanwhile> WHY WONT YOU DIE
<Creon77> 1 more song inc
<CircuitMane> No mother is that stupid! Right?!
<Aponymous> END
<Tovler> IT'S A CHRISTMAS CLASSIC!! *cans.wav*
<slurrymoon> Oh gosh this is Bull
<Aponymous> END
<AnonZach> Well he should have gone back in time in that phone booth and slapped himself upside the head for thinking about driving in a blizzard.
*Ghosties is slowly crying
<herospirit> and always
<ThePretender> Leave some for me LunaTheForgotten
<DeadlyBrony> Seriously this is just dragging me out
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> They won't even end this, will they?
<GabeMoist> PLEASE END
<Nittany_Discord> And nuclear war.
<Natleyn> TO HELL WITH LOVE AND TOLERANCE
<Aponymous> END GODDAMMIT END!
<AnonZach> Sheesh.
<Natleyn> THIS MUST BURN
<Rohirrim> ALWAYS AND ALWAYS AND ALWAYS AND ALWAYS AND ALWAYS AND ALWAYS
<GGgale> BELIEVING makes a merry Xmas! no matter if you actually celebrate it or not
<Sumica> Wait, they are rehasing the moral again?
<DeadlyBrony> It moves
<DeadlyBrony> it moves
<Meanwhile> And then it shot her in the face.
<Euponytor> You can have a merry christmas every year if only you believe
<GabeMoist> NO

<DeadlyBrony> I only saw the last 5 minutes, and I wanted to strangle myself from that ending
<Tovler> FUCK, that ending manipulated me.
<Meanwhile> The shift in tone has given me nausea
<LordCelestia> We need to kill the trees before they kill us!
<CircuitMane> Yes, now this I can get behind
<LunaTheForgotten> *Thank*
<CloudRunner> Needs higher quality but Im ok with this

<Euponytor> applejack has a whole lot of ranks in use rope
<ValtheJean> 2,14 okay people, since this keeps happening I'm going to tell you all now
<Meanwhile> Well i'm actually going to blender someone.
*Natleyn hugs Rainbow_derp goodnight
<LunaTheForgotten> Bye
<lonelypony> we're babes in toyland veterans now
<ValtheJean> 2,14 do NOT flood the chat
<Natleyn> Sleep well!
<Creon77> Anything is higher quality after that trainwreck of a movie
<lonelypony> nothing can phase us
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I'm off, good night all.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 there is a bot in place that will kick for it
<Sumica> it's not me.
<lonelypony> faze
<lonelypony> even
<Ghosties> 04Val, I'm sure we'll be fine now
*Rohirrim and party gains 15k exp! *fanfare*
<Meanwhile> I will never let anyone forget that movie.
<Luna> 07,1night derpy
<Tovler> I often confuse Derpy with Cloud Kicker
<ValtheJean> 2,14 if you trigger it too much, it WILL ban you
<Aponymous> We made it...
*Natleyn hugs DERPDERPDERPDERP goodnight
<DeadlyBrony> OH GOD! HER MANE T^T!
<CloudRunner> Lol true
<AnonZach> Goodnight Kirzstryfe.
*Revolver hugs Luna
<Meanwhile> The blender shall live on.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I am warning you all now, so that way you are aware
<VioletVanilla> 06Goodnight Derpy~
<Ghosties> 04Since that...abomination...ended, I think everyone is back to normal now
<Aponymous> I'm not sure how to feel about surviving though...
<GabeMoist> What about Manos?
<Tovler> Notepad... never forget
<GabeMoist> non MST3K?
<Dumori> I'm out
<lonelypony> manos is just...
<lonelypony> snorefest
<AnonZach> And Applejack is maxed out on strength as well.
<lonelypony> there's no songs at least
<LunaTheForgotten> Notepad will live in our hrearts forever
<CircuitMane> I will never be normal again
<Lagmobile> well im gonna play all the luna.exe's in a row back to back now...
<GabeMoist> Star Wars Holiday Special?
<Thunder_Dash> Notepad...?
<AnonZach> And the movie was actually post Reagan.
<Tovler> Rarity's accent is weak
<lonelypony> ....
<CircuitMane> But then again...I wasn't normal to begin with...
<lonelypony> okay
<GabeMoist> there's songs in that
*ThePretender wishes everyone who's leaving a good night.
<Cobalt> well I'm gonna head out for the night. Night everyone
<Aponymous> Notepad was the best actor in that shitfest.
<CloudRunner> 0_0 just opened high quality stream popout... PONIES IN STEREO!
<AnonZach> Infinity plus one is just one.
<Dumori> Better than this gabe.
<Luna> 07,1notepad was awesome
*Natleyn hugs Cobalt goodnight
<DeadlyBrony> That ending just seemed way too clingy, in fact, it seems almost like a parody of child movie endings: It's like the Doogal Movie ending, where they cannot let us assume that they ended happily ever after
<Tovler> Notepad could have saved us all.
<Meanwhile> Rarity is getting a blender for christmas.
<AnonZach> Or so I've been told.
<Euponytor> really? it feels like early 80's, early 70's
*LunaTheForgotten hugs ThePretender goodnight
<PinkiePieR^2> Hay guys. :)
<Dumori> This is that bad and 140 min long
<lonelypony> I admit that drugged up carrie fisher singing is pretty damn funny
<Lagmobile> i want t nominate notepad for s grammy
<Euponytor> ..you were told wrong
<AnonZach> 1986
<Euponytor> but adding infinity to anything is silly
<ThePretender> XD I'm not leaving yet
<LordCelestia> Their arguments arent making any sense
<Rohirrim> And fast.
<Natleyn> The ONLY reason I made it through that movie
<Natleyn> Is SHOO BE DOO
<AllisZero> So tired, fuu
<ThePretender> but I appreciate the gesture
<lonelypony> can I get unbanned now that the movie's done? :/
<Darf14> Hmm....after only watching a minute of ponies I completely forgot what we watched last ...oh well
<Thunder_Dash> My Little Pony, My Little Pony~
<LunaTheForgotten> Oh.Sorry,I miss read
<Meanwhile> SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
<slurrymoon> Now this is a good song!
<Thunder_Dash> I used to wonder what friendship could beee~
<CloudRunner> Luna y u no fluttershy room!? I miss you.
<Ghosties> 04Dear god, it's like an antidote being poured straight into my ears...now THIS is a fucking song
<Tovler> Suddenly, no more Dash
<herospirit> ppppppppoooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
<Luna> 07,1i'm here
<Lagmobile> yes
<Aponymous> Summon Val and ask
*GabeMoist makes wookie sounds

<CloudRunner> why?
<Lagmobile> and much regoicing was heard...
<lonelypony> I'll try :(
<Drunklestia> Sup again guys
<herospirit> And suddenly I am okay with life again
<Luna> 07,1will be back for the euro-show
<Rohirrim> Remastered themesong. Right nao.
<lonelypony> honestly that last kick
<ValtheJean> 2,14 do or do not, there is no try
<Drunklestia> My friends are making me watch Yo Gaba Gaba
<lonelypony> http://img838.imageshack.us/img838/4420/bfail.png
<CloudRunner> When is that?
<DeadlyBrony> ITS LUKE!
<Drunklestia> All I have to say is
*ThePretender feels that all is right with the world.
<lonelypony> didn't even think I was flooding
<Drunklestia> What the royal fuck
<Euponytor> how DOES AJ's hat stay on?!
<herospirit> Seriously, this just utterly destroyed my depression.
<Tovler> Imma have to download Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. Now THAT is a nostalgic Musical
<Euponytor> is it stapled to her head or what?
<Lagmobile> make them watch mlp with you instead
<CloudRunner> Also, I am saddened by this news
*Natleyn hugs herospirit and swings him around
<DeadlyBrony> Oh god, it's Spike up there holding up the POLE!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 dude, you need to stop breaking up your chat into pieces
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's considered spam
<Rohirrim> Why can't it be a regular lightning rod? :c
<Natleyn> I think that movie made me depressed.
<GGgale> a magical lightning rod? does it really need to be magic?
<ThePretender> ooooh, guys

<DeadlyBrony> Once upon a time: There was a movie staring Keanu Reeves and christmas...
<Thunder_Dash> WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY...
<Amino> I love this episode, even is Twilight acts like a complete moron during it xD
<Lagmobile> http://arch.413chan.net/(0158)1310345691847-(n1315119005716).gif
<Natleyn> OOoooOOOOOoOOoOO

<DeadlyBrony> Nice sound bite
<norsehorse> 999
<DragonRage> This episode.
<DeadlyBrony> o_o
<Rohirrim> THE LEGEND OF THE SCAT MAN
*Luna is tired
<DragonRage> Love it.
<Flutterguy> Huh?
<Natleyn> Ghosties: u mad?
<Ghosties> 04I would like to invoke the Worst Movie clause
<DeadlyBrony> T^T
<Meanwhile> Headless horse fell into a blender.
<DragonRage> Love al the episodes, but this one especially.
<Flutterguy> I'm confused :/
<Crono_flash> I guess I missed something besides the episodes and the movies
<Natleyn> Ghosties: It's okay, I'd be mad too
<Euponytor> fun fact: twilight is making the lightning happen on cue
<DeadlyBrony> I'm scared, guys
<mib_8z7f8r> hi how do i use another irc client for this
<DeadlyBrony> Someone hold me...
<happypony> Ghosties, so it's official: Spider's Web > Babes in Toyland
<Ghosties> 04That if the entire chat despised the film, then we don't re-stream it
<DeadlyBrony> T^T!!!!!
<Tovler> Bruce Wayne was afraid of Scat... thus
<Mezkalito> oh gosh oh gosh..
<AnonZach> Sounds like timmy now
<Darf14> Oh, that story is not sc- YAHHHHHHH!!!!
<Rohirrim> I wan't to hear the full story :/
<CloudRunner> Wait. what time did Luna say?
<Meanwhile> Where'd that lantern go?
*ThePretender would like to tell the story of a movie. A movie that terrorized bronies for two hours. Teeth were gnashed, tears were shed, guns were shot!
<happypony> inb4 cannabalism
*Natleyn hugs RAWRity
<Euponytor> rarity and applejack are totally avoiding their feelings for each other
<Mezkalito> suddenly, cannibalism
<Flutterguy> mib_8z7f8r The server is rainbowdash.ponychat.net and the channel is @bronystate.
<Darf14> Canibalism!!
<Jigglysaint> but then that's no fun
<Rohirrim> One flag.
<Thunder_Dash> Confirmed: Rarity is OCD
<slurrymoon> hooves == magnets?
<Meanwhile> Sweetie Bell got blended -> smores.
<AnonZach> Om nom nom.
*CloudRunner page refreshed and cant read old posts
<RAWRity> hi natelyn
<LunaTheForgotten> That movie was so bad not even the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 group would watch it.
<Natleyn> Welcome back everypony that left because of the movie that caused widespread depression!
<Lagmobile> the tale of BABES IN TOYLAND!
<mib_8z7f8r> Flutterguy: thanks
<GabeMoist> Ya just eat em
<Ghosties> 04Yes, Spider's Web over Babes in Toyland. At least with Spider's Web I laughed
<DeadlyBrony> eeehaa, Just eat em!
<Jigglysaint> Rarity is NOT OCD
<Digitalforehead> 2PM EST
<Tovler> Rarity is good with Marshmallows
<DeadlyBrony> True
<Rohirrim> Pardon.
<happypony> with Babes in Toyland we just cried
<Jigglysaint> OCD is totally different
<Ghosties> 04I *NEVER* laughed at Babes in Toyland
<DeadlyBrony> At least Spiders Web didn't drag on for so long
<Meanwhile> I cried a few times.
<Rohirrim> Anyone getting the audio derpy?
<happypony> you know we never did see a single babe in toyland
<CircuitMane> @Ghosties Agreed entirely! Plus Spider's Web was short!
*ThePretender hands out smores to everyone!
<Jigglysaint> being careful and neat is not OCD, neither is not like getting dirty
<AnonZach> http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/223/7/0/cannibal_lolocaust_by_pixelkitties-d466hh1.png
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I laughed...uncomfortably....you know, the kind where you laugh because the only other option is cry hysterically
<herospirit> I laughed once, Ghosties
<Euponytor> twilight's clueface
<Tovler> I cried at Babes in Toyland such nostalgia
*Meanwhile blends his smore.
<DeadlyBrony> I mean, I only came a few minutes at the end, and I felt it was too long
<LunaTheForgotten> I killed myself 3 times I think during that movie.
<CloudRunner> Yay~
<Jigglysaint> granted they can be manifest in OCD sufferers
<Drunklestia> S0pider's web is the one with the pig lying right?
*Flutterz went to play SC2 and returned to see MLP: FUCK YEAH
<RAWRity> The Rarity "marshmallow" joke is difficult for me to enjoy after seeing the "Pony Thread Simulator 3" video
<Natleyn> ValtheJean: This.
<Ghosties> 04Web is "So bad it's good." Babes was "So bad it's deadly"
<CloudRunner> :)
<herospirit> "I know! Jail break! YAAAAAAAAY"
<DeadlyBrony> ME!?
<Thunder_Dash> Oh, my bad. Re: Dirt - Mysophobia, then. :P
<DeadlyBrony> Deadly like me T^T
<Crono_flash> Luna, are you guys streamming tomorrows episode?
<Drunklestia> >Pony Thread Simulator 3
<Tovler> Timmy Turner and Da Rules
<Natleyn> Ghosties: The movie literally made me depressed.
<Thunder_Dash> Or however you spell it, I'm tired
<Drunklestia> There's another one?
<Flutterguy> Does this look like an iPhone herospirit?
<Drunklestia> Oh god
<Lagmobile> PARTY INSIDE PINKY *AAAHHHHHH!*
<Euponytor> LMFAO zach
<CloudRunner> Its the rule... DAMNIT TWILIGHT! I LOST THE GAME!
<Drunklestia> AHAHAHAHAAHAH
<AnonZach> Oh noes! I disconnected! I missed part of an episoded I've only seen forty times!
<Euponytor> and now rarity looks like pinkamina
<herospirit> It depressed me too.
<lordpie> :D
<Meanwhile> Where did she find that?
<DeadlyBrony> Hawt
<LunaTheForgotten> lol
<Tovler> Applejack's huh huh huh laugh
<happypony> wow, where did she get that
<Darf14> lol
<RAWRity> drunklestia yes there is. and it's just as scarring
<GabeMoist> nope
<herospirit> Like, it really did.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> I have the weirdest boner right now
<AnonZach> Pinkamina had style.
<Lagmobile> she had that in her closet
<Lagmobile> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-worst-sleepover-ever.jpg

<Tovler> SPARTA!
<Drunklestia> LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIES
<LunaTheForgotten> wap
<ValtheJean> 2,14 okay word of warning
<DeadlyBrony> Damn it
<LunaTheForgotten> wap
<Mezkalito> Twilight likes Friday
<CloudRunner> Cannon!
*ThePretender chucks a pillow at everyone!
<DeadlyBrony> wanted to do it
<Drunklestia> Gotta get down on friday
<Lagmobile> most epic pillow fight ever
<Darf14> This is the pillow fight to end all pillow fights!
*Flutterz hugs everyone
<ValtheJean> 2,14 cupcakes discussion/images is prohibited. The nature of that image is similar to cupcakes
<DeadlyBrony> INCOMING! GET DOWN!
<Thunder_Dash> Pillow "fight"? Still looks more like pillow warfare to me
*LunaTheForgotten smacks Thepretender with a pillow
<Rohirrim> BOOM HEADSHOT
<DeadlyBrony> TWILIGHT NO!!
*Flutterz then its eveeryone with pillows
<ValtheJean> 2,14 please refrain from things like that
<GabeMoist> pew
<happypony> TWILIGHT'S DOWN]
<RAWRity> drunklestia them not meaning it doesn't make the stuff they come up with any better though. Especially the stuff they say about Sweetie Belle...
<GabeMoist> pew pew
<Lagmobile> Where was Gondor...
*Meanwhile blends a pillow
<CircuitMane> Pony Down!!!!
<Tovler> neck dodge
<DeadlyBrony> *Smacks EVERYONE!*
*LunaTheForgotten hits Luna with a pillow
<Crono_flash> Is tomorrow's episode going to be streamed?
<Euponytor> what? pinkamina in canon is who she was on the rock farm
<Aponymous> Submarine Twilight!
<Mezkalito> gentlemen
<Nittany_Discord> Twilight caught in the crossfire.
*ThePretender whaps LunaTheForgotten with a pillow
<Flutterguy> Twilight with pillow on head is best Twilight.
<CloudRunner> Fu- *WHAP*
<Drunklestia> >pillowhead
<LunaTheForgotten> oof
<Natleyn> Rarity settling into bed time!
<Euponytor> and, arguably, in episode 25
<Natleyn> <3
*Thunder_Dash throws a pillow at ThePretender
<Rohirrim> Where did Applejack's hat go? D:
<Tovler> I'd sleep past the premiere. Youtube will upload it super fast anyway.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I was refering to zach's image
<herospirit> I'm also ill. I get really depressed when I'm sick. Sometimes I know I'm going to get sick because of the depression. And then that horrible, horrible movie....
<happypony> time for a reverse striptease, everypony
<Natleyn> YES
<Flutterz> heil sleepover nazi
<CloudRunner> Ponies, why do you need such a big bed?
<RAWRity> rohirrim probably a hat rack
<DeadlyBrony> Like this
*ThePretender charges at Thunder_Dash with a pillow
<Natleyn> YESSSSSSSSSSSS
<LordCelestia> snuggly
<happypony> clopclopclopclop
<Mezkalito> do not fap to ponies!
<CloudRunner> also, Rarity has OCD
<DeadlyBrony> Eeeyah
<Natleyn> M. Bison: YES! YES!
<Darf14> I prefer AppleJacks method getting into bed
<Thunder_Dash> CAN'T HEAR YA, AH'M ASLEEP
<AnonZach> Yes. I understand. I sincerely apologize.
<Rohirrim> I do not belive in hat racks.
<Tovler> yeah?
<GGgale> dat honesty
<DeadlyBrony> Clop
*LunaTheForgotten charges everypony with a pillow
<Rohirrim> CHUU.
<Digitalforehead> So much for element of generosity
<happypony> aaaashew
<Tovler> shoo
<RAWRity> why does this fandom need to make me constantly see shipping in EVERYTHING now?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's alright, just keep it in mind next time ;)
<DeadlyBrony> NOT
<Flutterguy> RAWRity, Right?
<Sumica> supprised they did't rip that blanket in half.
<CloudRunner> lol
<DeadlyBrony> Twilight spoke, and they were silenced
<Flutterz> Why does Applejack look naked without her hat?
<Lagmobile> She sounds so cute with her mouth stuffed
<Meanwhile> The number one thing to do at a slumber party is blend things.
<Lagmobile> wait...
<Rohirrim> Wait, did anyone count how many times Twilight said fun?
<AnonZach> :D Will do!
<Darf14> The book knows all
<happypony> flutterz, you're right 0.o
<herospirit> I should sleep, but I'm going to be depressed if I don't have ponies to cheer me up.
<Lagmobile> that sounded wrong
<happypony> Fun... fun... fun... fun...
<Darf14> She just have to say that
<GabeMoist> yep
<Aponymous> Because she is nake dwithout her hat
<Flutterz> Well, I alwayas am :P
<Euponytor> IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG
<Tovler> aww, she's cute in bad
<CloudRunner> Twilight. Stop jinxing stuff
<Rohirrim> bad.
<LunaTheForgotten> I think I'm going to sleep.
<Tovler> Lights on
<RAWRity> It's like, I've been writing a fic and every time I write a scene with AJ and RD talking, I'm constantly on the lookout for anythign that could be made into a double entendre
<DeadlyBrony> OOOAAAHH T^T
<Flutterguy> Wait.
*ThePretender climbs into his bed.
<happypony> still that's fascinating how she can seem so unclothed without her hat
<LunaTheForgotten> but I can't decide
<Euponytor> ...that's not a loose branch
<Flutterz> Suddenly rainstorm
<herospirit> I agree, happypony
<AnonZach> How is the rope just staying there?
<Darf14> bad idea
<Flutterguy> inb4 CoD reference
<Tovler> GENIUS
<Natleyn> >Tree in a tree
<LunaTheForgotten> Should I?
<Flutterz> GENIOUS
<happypony> applefail
<Flutterguy> treeception?
<Meanwhile> Ramirez get me a tree
*Rohirrim claims the top bunk of an vacant bunk bed
<Wanderlust> thats not a branch applejack
<Lagmobile> gonna finish this episode then go to bed to catch the next episde this morning
<Meanwhile> And a blender
<Darf14> Treeception!
<Aponymous> TREECEPTION!
<Euponytor> where did she get the rope from?
<Flutterguy> RAMIREZ
<Lagmobile> RAMIREZ
<Natleyn> Flutterguy AWE YEEE
<happypony> and now twilight loses it lol
<Aponymous> *BRRRRRRRRMMMMMMM*
<Darf14> HAH! Beat you to it
<ThePretender> wait till the end of ep, LunaTheForgotten
<Flutterguy> CUT THAT TREE DOWN WITH YOUR FLASHLIGHT
<Rohirrim> Yo dawg, I herd u liek trees.
<happypony> LOOK IN THE BOOK
<LunaTheForgotten> Fine
<LordCelestia> i dont get where thecod4 reference was
<RAWRity> lagmobile you say that, and then you stay up all night like I did last week.
<Flutterguy> LordCelestia soon
<Thunder_Dash> So even if her room gets destroyed... If the book says so, it's okay..>?
<Meanwhile> Ramirez, take out that gunship with this freshly caught mackerel!
<Tovler> A Leaf/branch/tree turducken.
<Creon77> *AJ shifty eyes*
<happypony> and, as much as it shames me to admit it as a Rarity fanboy
<Lagmobile> RAMIREZ! HAVE FUN AT THIS SLUMBER PARTY RIGHT NOW!
<happypony> Applejack is the bigger pony here
<DeadlyBrony> Please, I got the book, and the first page says: PAGES
<Flutterz> BUCK THAT TREE HARD, AJ!
<Natleyn> Thunder_Dash: That just means it was a good night. :3
<Mezkalito> first: where's her hat?
<CloudRunner> She is looking in the "B"s
<ThePretender> Is everyone having fun at this BronyState sleepover? :3
<Euponytor> it... blew off?!
<DeadlyBrony> I wish
<lordpie> yea
<Meanwhile> I am now that that mvoei is over
<Lagmobile> I know i am
<happypony> AJ used apology! It's super effective! Rarity friendshipped!
<Natleyn> ThePretender: Yes. :3
<Euponytor> but I thought the staples would stop
<Meanwhile> i couldn't even spell movie
<Meanwhile> that's how bad it rattled me
<LunaTheForgotten> I am
<Tovler> Babes in Toyland was one Doozy of a B movie
<Rohirrim> I'm sure almost being smashed by a tree is not a small detail.
<ThePretender> yay!
*Natleyn hugs Meanwhile
<Natleyn> It'll be okay
<Lagmobile> THAT WAS THE DOOSY!
<Darf14> close call AJ
<CloudRunner> She should be looking in OMFG THERE IS A TREE IN MY HOUSE!. She would probably find what she is looking for.
<happypony> b movie? more like -z movie
<LunaTheForgotten> Babes in toyland was a F-Movie
<Natleyn> You need some shoo be doo recovery
<RAWRity> I missed the lottery, what's the next set of movies?
<Tovler> I kinda wish we just had 2 A movies
<Euponytor> who does the music score for this anyway
<Meanwhile> Twilight is getting a blender for christmas.
<Natleyn> Incredibles and Yellow Submarine
<AnonZach> There are no staples. It was water soluble glue.
<ThePretender> it was a -Z movie
<happypony> next week's special event had better be spectacular to make up for that travesty
<RAWRity> Incredibles is good.
<Euponytor> makes a minimal amount of sense
<Euponytor> seeing as how it was a rainstorm
<happypony> and if my suspicions are correct
<Flutterguy> Incredibles is pretty awesome.
<AnonZach> I don't know but it is epic.
<Natleyn> Yeah.
<Lagmobile> Yellow Submarine, Incredibles
<Tovler> 1 obvious A movie and one unknown A movie.
<RAWRity> there's a special event?
<Darf14> Yellow Submarine sounds interesting
<happypony> it will bee (tee-hee, pun)
<Flutterz> Is there some rule for picking A and B movies? Like the B movies has to be worse or something?
<Aponymous> What IS next weeks special event?
<LordCelestia> still dont get the cod4 reference
<Applejackismaiwaifu> How about Short Circuit?
<CloudRunner> Rarity. How did you get that dirty
<Flutterguy> Never mind Lord.
<CloudRunner> ?
<Tovler> Yellow Submarine is also hard to sit through.
<LordCelestia> okay
<ThePretender> oooh, Short Circuit is awesome
<Lagmobile> How has no one heard of the Yellow Submarine?
<happypony> B movie doesn't have to be worse, per se
<herospirit> a B movie is either "So bad it's good" or a cult classic
<Rohirrim> I think B movies are less reknowned movies.
<DeadlyBrony> Awwwwwhh
<RAWRity> flutterz no rule like that, it's just that B-movies are generally lower quality
<Tovler> Johnny 5
<happypony> I mean, DS2 was better than whatever else we watched that night
<Flutterz> Yellow Submarine is infinitely better than Babes
<AnonZach> I love Applejacks face when she is about to kick the tree trunks.
<happypony> DS2 was better than anything we've watched so far period
<Darf14> silly Twilight
<LunaTheForgotten> no
<Meanwhile> Not in the book = mass confusion
<DeadlyBrony> Where did that come from...REALLY?
<LunaTheForgotten> no
<happypony> except perhaps inception
<Euponytor> she would have sent that clear to canterlot lol
<Rohirrim> Do ghostbusters count as an A movie?
<Tovler> but everyone's heard of Babes
<RAWRity> what's DS2?
<DeadlyBrony> YES
<Lagmobile> How has no one herad of Yellow Submarine?
<Euponytor> in during twilight being a huge aspie
<happypony> deathstalker TOO
<ThePretender> I've heard OF it
<Natleyn> Tovler: I haven't'.
<CloudRunner> Dude, what are you two talking about?
<LunaTheForgotten> I haven't
<Mezkalito> epic faces
<happypony> wasn't yellow submarine a cartoon?
<PinkiePieR^2> Hi everybody!
<Tovler> >ass
<GabeMoist> nah
<Thunder_Dash> I'm not sure if I asked before, I think I have, but what about Castle in the Sky? Would that be A or B?
<Darf14> wow...
<Meanwhile> Nope
<happypony> a really really trippy cartoon?
<AnonZach> Epic guesses.
<ThePretender> Ghostbusters is a AAAA
<Meanwhile> It's chuck testa
<Rohirrim> That depends, the beatles?
<RAWRity> I still say that our B-Movie sometime NEEDS to be "Nudist Colony of the Dead"
<Flutterz> That's a telescope, silly Twi
<DeadlyBrony> Yes...that movie has no dick
<Mezkalito> that sounds better
<Lagmobile> yes the Beatles Movie
<Euponytor> I only wonder what their first 17's guesses are
<CloudRunner> AJ you instigator!
<Lagmobile> Or Shawn of the dead
<Rohirrim> I'm only familliar with the song.
<Flutterz> Pain in the Patootie
<happypony> >argue with each other over who's more annoying
<DeadlyBrony> SHAWN OF THE DEEEAD
<Lagmobile> or Hot Fuzz
<RAWRity> anypony here seen NCotD?
<Mezkalito> they all were Chuck Testa
<Rohirrim> WE ALL LIVE IN A YELLOW SUBMARINE, YELLOW SUBMARINE, YELLOW SUBMARINE.
<Meanwhile> Shawn of the dead is amazing
<Flutterguy> What's NCotD?
<LordCelestia> brohoof!
<Thunder_Dash> Hot Fuzz? Make it happen.
<Lagmobile> nope.zvi
<Meanwhile> and so is Hot fuzz
<Rohirrim> AAAHH SHE SAID FUN AGAIN
<Tovler> Can movies like Ken Park and A Serbian Movie be played here?
<lordpie> :)
<Meanwhile> Bring on Alien damnit.
<DeadlyBrony> Love the directors commentary
<happypony> urgh, am I the only one who gets a little creeped out by that thing they do where they go "yeaaah!"
<DragonRage> Pillow Hat is best hat.
<DeadlyBrony> Edgar Wright should co-direct the next MLP movie
<RAWRity> Nudist Colony of the Dead, a musical zombie comedy
<Euponytor> considering the way twilight's books are treated
<herospirit> I can't decide if I like Shawn of the Dead or Hot Fuzz better.
<ThePretender> A Serbian Movie, I think not
<Euponytor> they must have a GOOD printing press in Equestria
<Tovler> the yeeeah thing is so 80s
<CloudRunner> AJ's left and Rarity's left were the same left...
<Natleyn> Hot Fuzz would be a great movie to show here.
<happypony> ThePretender, no thanks, I like having a soul
<AnonZach> And a quite profitable one.
<LunaTheForgotten> *wap*
<RAWRity> thepretender I don't think anypony would be left after THAT
<DeadlyBrony> CAUGHT BY THE FUZZ, WHILE I was-STILL ON THE FUZZ
<Tovler> A Serian Movie is probably illegal in most countries anyway.
<LordCelestia> Aw no more...
<ThePretender> I wasn't suggesting it ;_;
<Jigglysaint> night
<DeadlyBrony> Wait
<RAWRity> seriously, seeing that thing once was enough for me
<Lagmobile> te "yeah" reminds me of the WACKY INFLATABLE ARM FLAILING INFLATEABLE TUBEMEN
<ThePretender> I was just saying that no
<Natleyn> Night Jigglysaint!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh I needed that cheer up :P
<DeadlyBrony> No secret butt fun?
<Tovler> aww, no more requests
<herospirit> Night everyone
<Meanwhile> Now that my soul and mind have been blended.
<Darf14> aww...no more ponies
<Rohirrim> THE CLOUDS ARE MOVING ON THEIR OWN WHAT THE*shot*
<RAWRity> tovler no illegal, just awufl
<Jigglysaint> be back for the s2 stream
<happypony> we should watch Lord of War for some serious soulcrushing
<LunaTheForgotten> Now what
<herospirit> May your dreams be filled with ponies.
<GabeMoist> yay
<ThePretender> I haven't seen it, but I know what happens
<Flutterz> Rarity should have told AJ to go to the OTHER left :D
<Natleyn> ValtheJean: It's like the weight of the world was lifted from my shoulders...
<Aponymous> I needed Ponies after... That.
<GabeMoist> see you all tomorrow
<slurrymoon> Alright, goodnight bronies, see ya for season 2!
<Tovler> But Nic Cage is in that movie.
<happypony> Lord of War is the only Nic Cage movie I can take seriously

<Euponytor> what... just, what?
<Meanwhile> I do not want to know.
<Darf14> Oh no...no....please no..
*Aponymous has a bad feeling about this
<Natleyn> Bye ThePretender!
<Meanwhile> Night everypony.
<AnonZach> Sea Ponies are decades ahead of all our cell phone technologies.
<happypony> ....... impossible
<Sumica> Something new i found today.
<RAWRity> This does not seem promising.
*Natleyn hugs ThePretender goodnight
<Flutterguy> Night Mean
<happypony> something worse than G3.5
<Lagmobile> wtf?
<Applejackismaiwaifu> attack the crab's weak point for massive damage
<Drunklestia> THESE ARE THE WRONG TINY HORSES
<Crickettwb> Oh, hi Natleyn!
<Flutterguy> Meanwhile*
<Euponytor> WHAT IS THIS
<happypony> this... this can't be real
<Thunder_Dash> What is this?
<Drunklestia> THESE ARE NEITHER PASTEL, MAGICAL OR CUTE
<Digitalforehead> What in Equestria is this?
*ThePretender hugs Natleyn good night!
<Darf14> Uhh....WTF is this?!?!
<Lagmobile> wtf is this?
<PinkiePieR^2> What is this? It looks weird.
<Sumica> good news this has a song too.
<Rohirrim> A stream waiting for a new episode of MLP. You will never find a bigger hive of ponies and friendship.
<Flutterguy> I'm 18 and what is this.
<Flutterz> SEASON 2 SPOILER WARNING!! The episode will be 20 minutes and will involve some or all of the following ponies: Twilight, Rainbow Dash, Rarity and Fluttershy
<happypony> >mfw this is actually better animated than newborns
<CloudRunner> I dont think it is from Equestria...
<AnonZach> Did he just call her fat?
<Crickettwb> I don't get what this is. . . . .
<Euponytor> please tell me one of these breaks its neck
<Euponytor> yes, yes he did
<RAWRity> "heavier than the rest of us, she has massive body image issues"
<Cabrony> noooooooooooooooo! you b*****
<CloudRunner> But it is bad all the same.
<Rohirrim> AAGHAHH FLUTTERZ YOU LIT-*shot*
<Euponytor> SNAP
<Flutterz> problem? :D
<Crickettwb> crunch
<happypony> who is streaming
<Aponymous> .....
<Lagmobile> no really what is this?
<happypony> luna still
<Darf14> the animation sucks
<AnonZach> They.. They have no cutie marks. They can't be ponies...
<GGgale> it's hell
*Aponymous mutes the stream
<Euponytor> seriously what the HELL am I watching
<Mezkalito> "I'm not ready?" Rarity?
<True_Discord> Well this Draconequus needs rest, see everypony in 8 hours
<happypony> oh god make it stop
<PinkiePieR^2> Does anypony know what this is?
<RAWRity> LET'S ALL MOCK OUR FRIENDS
<Cabrony> stream is gonna crash 5 minutes before the show
*Rohirrim mocks RAWRity
<Lagmobile> YAY
<Darf14> man, these ponies are ass*****!
<ThePretender> I keep thinking this'll take a bad turn somewhere
<happypony> I SEE A CAT! I SEE A RAT! I SEE A MAN WIV A BASEBALL BAT!
<Tajador> WTH
<Flutterguy> ThePretender Same here..
*RAWRity mocks himself
<CloudRunner> I dont know what this is, but I'm sure I hate it.
<Tajador> WTF
<Thunder_Dash> I CAN SEE A LADDER LEANING ON A LOG
<LotusTeaDragon> I've no idea.
<Lagmobile> Anyone know wtf this is?
<Rohirrim> Well if the stream magically explodes, I can just watch the episode recording on my DirecTV. :3
<Aponymous> Damn morbid curiosity...
<RAWRity> So is this, like British MLP?
<Euponytor> I thought Discord was the nightmare fuel
<happypony> think you're getting the HANG OF IT NOW
<PinkiePieR^2> I don't like this very much...
<Darf14> Its a Holy Shell
<Euponytor> but this is much, much worse
<Tovler> uugh. I have to play all my old Wii games so I can sell my Wii with no regrets
<pony_4372> what the fuck did i just walk into
<GGgale> inb4 musical number
<Mezkalito> MY BRAIN! IT IS MELTING!
<happypony> come on guys let's GET CREATIVE
<Aponymous> It's the Sea Ponies shell!
<Crickettwb> CALL THE SEAPONIES!
<ThePretender> =/
<Thunder_Dash> > mfw dat laugh
<Rohirrim> Oh no, RAWRity. It would have more PUDGY PONI
<CloudRunner> GGgale you barely made it
<LotusTeaDragon> I'm going to go out on a limb and say "British".
<happypony> I would be ashamed to be caught watching this
<Applejackismaiwaifu> What the **** am I watching?
<RAWRity> "Look what we got you. a present made from Beach Trash!"
<PinkiePieR^2> What is this?!
<happypony> don't be cross with us
<AnonZach> This is the kind of thing that having opposable thumbs would really help with.
<ThePretender> DAT SCOTTISH ACCENT
<Flutterz> SEASON 2 SPOILER WARNING: The plot may or may not be related to Seaponies!
<Tajador> fuck you
<Applejackismaiwaifu> Why is the chat derping?

<Mezkalito> lol
<AnonZach> Dang it! Their so hard to get rid of.
<RAWRity> So was that made on like a 5 dollar budget?
<Flutterz> should be #vinyl_scratch
<Tovler> eee, it's a little funny
<PinkiePieR^2> Why does nopony know what this is?
<Flutterguy> I'm going too, need some sleep.. good night everyone, hope to see you tomorrow morning.
<riverhipp1> yes, yes you are different
<happypony> guys say what you will, this was better animated than newborn cuties
<LotusTeaDragon> Accents?

<Thunder_Dash> ^
<Flutterz> yes, it was
<Crickettwb> Ponez?
<Darf14> lol

<CloudRunner> Brain Brain Brain Brain Brain Brain
<Darf14> So Twilight want's to take over the world....OF COURSE!
<ThePretender> byyye!
<Flutterz> NARF
<Lagmobile> is the request room open again?
<Euponytor> omg what
<Thunder_Dash> NARF.
<Mezkalito> aaah nice Minecraft
<AnonZach> That was beautiful.
<Digitalforehead> Hey, it's this again.
<Euponytor> HOLY CRAP
<Flutterz> bye, and have fun! :D
<PinkiePieR^2> Yay!
<Crickettwb> I like where this is going.
<Flutterz> yay minecraft!
<Mezkalito> wat
<ThePretender> thankee
<pony_1811> More songs? :D
<Euponytor> that's some impressive redstone
<Thunder_Dash> The time has come to welcome spring, and all things warm and green~!
<CloudRunner> I watched this 2 days ago. It is alittle off but it is still good
<Darf14> Minecraft....there will be someone better than us at this game :(
<CloudRunner> this is win
<LordCelestia> didn't we watch all of these earlier?
<Flameshy> agreed :3
<Sumica> same PL LordCelestia
<Thunder_Dash> Haha, coincidence much?
<Aponymous> Wow.
<RAWRity> how serendipitous
<LotusTeaDragon> Neat! What program or game is this from?
<Flutterz> WINTER WRAP UP
<Euponytor> this must have taken a week, at least
<happypony> vinyl is the request channel, right?
<CloudRunner> Cus tomorrow spring is here!
<RAWRity> sometimes I think they plan that stuff
<pony_1811> Minecraft
<CloudRunner> Im in love with this song
<RAWRity> happypony I believe so
<CloudRunner> Winter wrap up!
<LotusTeaDragon> Ah. Thank you. I should have known. It felt like something Minecraft, though I've never played.
<RAWRity> So...how many hourse do you think it took to make this?
<Euponytor> some of the notes are slightly off but there's no helping it
<Mezkalito> at least, yeah
<AnonZach> It got a bit lazy in the later part. beats are off a tiny bit.
<happypony> quite a few
<pony_4372> over 9000
<Flutterz> it could have been made by a program
<happypony> except he transcribed it by ear
<Flutterz> i remember something about one that converts midi to minecraft maps
<CloudRunner> I think this guys youtube said something like 20+ hours
<Euponytor> zach, there's seriously no helping it, redstone and jukeboxes aren't dynamic enough to do the short notes properly
<Flameshy> AJ Solo :3
<Flutterz> oh, okay then
<CloudRunner> Win
<RAWRity> If nothing else, you can't say Bronies aren't dedicated.
<Thunder_Dash> I envy anypony who can do this, I suck at using redstone XP
<Darf14> Heck, I have seen a video where someone made a Minecraft game inside of Minecraf...yes I am serious this time
<CloudRunner> Im bobing back and forth uncontrolably
<Dashite> Hey guys, what was the second pony episode?
<Flutterz> I've seen that
<Flutterz> Mineception
<CloudRunner> lol
<lordpie> awsome
<happypony> lolwut
<happypony> mineception?
<LotusTeaDragon> I'm going to guess this took a LOT of work.
<happypony> how's that work
<Lagmobile> ya i saw that
<Flutterz> look it up, a guy made minecraft in minecraft
<AnonZach> I know I know. Just so much win and then there's a bit of just spottyness.
<CloudRunner> He made a 2d minecraft in minecraft
<Thunder_Dash> I... wait, what?
<pony_1811> No kidding. It boggles the mind the time some people put into the stuff ont this game
<Lagmobile> yes they made a sidescrolling minecraft in minecaft
<Aponymous> How much time did it take to make this, I wonder?
<Darf14> Its an 8-bit game if I remember it, I think the vid is still in Youtube
<CloudRunner> Using redstone he made a computer that could play it
<LotusTeaDragon> Ha! :D :D
<happypony> yay pony polka
<Mezkalito> yeaaah some Weird Al!
<LotusTeaDragon> I agree, pony and OMG Weird Al!
<CloudRunner> Clop clop clop clop clop!
<Flutterz> the graphics in his game compared to the graphics in minecraft are similar to minecraft graphics compared to irl
<Crickettwb> clapclapclap
<Flameshy> :D
<CloudRunner> This is awesome
<AnonZach> Weird Al ftw.
<pony_1812> Bah, I had to change names to use the chat popput
<Euponytor> I can't believe I didn't realize it was him
<Lagmobile> found it
<pony_1812> popout*
<Lagmobile> minecraft in minecraft
<LotusTeaDragon> I thought about using the popout, but this just feels right.
<AnonZach> This was my song when I was like 15.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 fillies and gentlecolts
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I would like to direct your attention to #Vinyl_Scratch, where we will be taking youtube requests
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that is all
<LotusTeaDragon> I think this one's Polka your eyes out?
<LordCelestia> AND Let's all have a round of applause for Luna, who was kind enough to stay up with us!
<RAWRity> like we haven't already been doing that
<AustinWolfclaw> we put your minecraft in your minecraft so you can mine your craft in minecraft!
*Thunder_Dash glomps Luna again
<happypony> luna still here?
<pony_1812> I am not sure, but I do have a copy of the album this is from right next to me, and I can check if you'd like?
<happypony> oh I DO, trixie, I do
<AnonZach> Yes. Weird Al. I wish my girlfriend was more like you.
<AustinWolfclaw> All ready for epp 2 tomorrow?
<Dashite> Hey ValtheJean, what was the second pony episode tonight?
<Flutterz> eeyup
<Dermathil> (wait, did valthejean use M+ right there? I got absolutely no way of knowing)
<LotusTeaDragon> That would be great. I moved and since then can't find my Weird Al albums.
<Crickettwb> #vinyl_scratch
<Dashite> He did.
<Flutterz> We're Russian around
<Dermathil> alrighty then
*happypony laughs at lightirc
<Tovler> eeep. I requested a musical number from a certain movie... heh heh
<Sumica> luna went to bed already LordCelestia
<pony_1812> It would appear that is is "Polkarama"
<happypony> I just realized how dirty these lyrics are
<True_Discord> Hello LordCelestia
<LotusTeaDragon> Ah. I must have it confused with his "Bad Hair Day" album. Thank you. :D
<Dermathil> ALRIGHT EVERYBRONY, GNIGHT. Cyall for the premiere of S2E2!!!!!!!
<LordCelestia> heello discord
<TheMaster> i didn't realize weird al did versions of these songs
<Euponytor> the popularity of certain characters seem to be a direct inverse of their screen time
<happypony> now I ain't saying she's a goooold digger
<pony_1812> No problem! ;)
<RAWRity> haha censoring
<Euponytor> derpy, dj pon3, luna
<RAWRity> Also, Rarity is NOT a gold digger. She's a gem digger.
<RAWRity> much classier
<happypony> oh boy
<LordCelestia> yeah^
<AnonZach> I think it's because we want to see their characters explored more. We don't have the screen time so we make things up.
<happypony> this video.
<Euponytor> I think if a pony showed up for ONE frame with a distinguishing feature, the fans would be making 34 of her before the episode was over
<Digitalforehead> YES
<Euponytor> I guess
*happypony prepares his tissues
<Flutterz> aaaaaaah
<Thunder_Dash> I was about to go watch the MC in MC video, but...
<CloudRunner> I dont know where this is going, but I think I like it
<AustinWolfclaw> she still aint messing with no broke *****s
<LotusTeaDragon> This may be the official unofficial Brony anthem. Well, at least I think so. :D
<LordCelestia> ive never seen this video
<AnonZach> I agree and support your first statement completement.
<LordCelestia> oh nvm
<LordCelestia> i have
<Flutterz> i haven't
<Flameshy> what song is this?
<AnonZach> Okay. I just switched to French... for some reason.
<True_Discord> What's the title of this vid
<CloudRunner> Are you proud to be a Brony?
<Euponytor> Canadian?
<happypony> Proud to Be a Brony
<Darf14> yrd
<Tovler> feeding ferrets fish?
<Darf14> oops, I mean yes *facehoof*
<Tovler> I'm ashamed to be a brony ;-;
<AnonZach> Mais non. Je suis un American.
<CloudRunner> Proud to be a brony
<CloudRunner> whyy!?
<happypony> don't worry Tovler you'll get over it :P
<Lagmobile> why?
<AnonZach> I used to live in France when I was a kid.
<RAWRity> Seriously, the guy who made this song? GET HIM A MUSIC CAREER
<LotusTeaDragon> *eee* :p
<Euponytor> ah
<happypony> I was that for about three weeks, then suddenly LAWL I'm headed to toys 'r us
<TheMaster> I prefer to just keep my bronyism to myself
<CloudRunner> yes
<Sumica> "Are You Proud to be a Brony"
<Thunder_Dash> What happypony said. :P
<Sumica> song name
<pony_1812> I was thinking that the "unofficial" theme was this, Pony Swag: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1HZp4ClFXY
<TheMaster> other than when i watch it with my little sister at my house
<pony_1812> NSFW language, watchout
<Flutterz> I'm proud to be a brony, but nobody irl would ever let me live it down if I told them
<AnonZach> It happens occaisionally. Though I can't help it.
<LotusTeaDragon> Oh, and loving the pony emoticons, whomever implemented these.
<RAWRity> I'm planning on being more open about my bronyness once I've got napowrimo done.
<happypony> "live it down"
<happypony> as if it's something to live down
<AnonZach> I don't even speak it fluently anymore though.
<pony_1812> Do you offhand, know what the name of the song currently on the stream is?
<LotusTeaDragon> "Pony Swag" is good, though I'm not big on the language (as if I have room to speak).
<happypony> oh I love this part!
<LotusTeaDragon> This song?
<pony_1812> Yeah
<True_Discord> I have buddies on campus who are bronies
<LotusTeaDragon> Yeah, it's "Proud to be a Brony"
<Darf14> This guy has a good voice, give him a career!
<AnonZach> I'm proud of myself. I converted a guy to MLP:FIM at my college.
<pony_1812> Excellent, thank you! :D
<Crickettwb> True_Dischord You're lucky. I haven't found a single one.
<RAWRity> darf14 that's what I'm saying
<True_Discord> So I don't have to worry about hiding being a brony
<AnonZach> What song is this?
<LotusTeaDragon> You're welcome! ;)
<happypony> I was sitting in my engineering class the other day
<Applejackismaiwaifu> wouldn't it be funny if they replaced the term C-mark with boobs?
