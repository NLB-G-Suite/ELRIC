<CubedUranium> i watched it because of curiosity and because my friends were like: "if you havent watched it yet, don't say you don't like it"
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://hackaday.com/2012/11/24/programming-a-game-boy-while-playing-pokemon/
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> I saw Friendship is Magic BITCH frontpage on Newgrounds

<Goodrita> pony_6275: I started as an anti-brony, the only reason i watched it is because i wanted to make an argument that actually made sense

<Coey890> CCharmanderK, wait, what? :o
<Kipkat07_USAF> mmm... cooked rabit
<WindWhistler> but only for a split second
<Kipkat07_USAF> *rabbit
<CubedUranium> ah... slapstick humor
<CCharmanderK> The initial version of this film released in thaters and on laserdisc had a couple of frames late in the film that revealed that Jessica went commando.
<DinkyDoo> OMG OW.
<Kipkat07_USAF> oh god....
<RainbowDerpy> y u buffer
<Stary> Smart kid :)
<DinkyDoo> o_o...

<DoctoDoctorWho1> Ok, good.
<DinkyDoo> All this trouble just for a cookie.
<aniderp> stanley
<Michael> brb
<LordDerpington> There's also a part just now where Baby Herman sticks his hand up the woman's skirt - again, only spotted in the LD version, but I've never seen any later releases with those frames intact.
<Rainbow--Dash> Back when shows had more funny violence c:

<WindWhistler> Only the cartoons are animated
<Metronome> Toons
<LordDerpington> The crowning achievement of animation/live action combination movies.
<Vordox> WindWhistler: No
<WindWhistler> everything else is live action
<AJIsAwesome> Toons.

<Canebridge> Nah, of Roger Rabbit :-)
<AJIsAwesome> ...
<DoubleDragonNeonFTW> Disney is buying out everybody these days. xD
<DoubleDragonNeonFTW> :D
<spyrofan001> 6i bet
<VenHur> Disney and Warner Bros both collabed with this movie.
<cowvarkian> yes I know, so mature
<Stary> Hhmph XD
<Lasharus> Sterling example of humour, there.

<Coey890> BronyDarth: NO PLEASE
<AJIsAwesome> Canebridge: Ah, Roger messed up his lines and Eddie's trying to solve a case of murder.
<RainbowDerpy> and hasbro owns the Hub
<Cyberlord> it is only a matter of time
<VenHur> ...Damn it, living in a world with co-existing cartoons would be the GREATEST LIFE EVER!
<Vordox> Moo
<Kipkat07_USAF> BronyDarth: That will be the day I jump off of a bridge
<thelonepony> cowvarkian: someone said that in mane or the movie?
<CubedUranium> they already bought jetix years ago, and now it only airs disney cartoons :/
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Moo
<DoubleDragonNeonFTW> They bought out Nuclear missile silos already. :D
<cachi01> moooooo
<Azuredragon> I dont care if they buy the HUB, Hasbro however...
<cowvarkian> thelonepony: I said it
<Kipkat07_USAF> MOO
<thelonepony> oh
<BronyDarth> There was a company that declined a contract from disney giving 1.000.000 dollars...
<thelonepony> :P
<Canebridge> Thanks AJIsAwesome :-)
<BronyDarth> I would say it was a great thing to do.
<AJIsAwesome> Glad to help, Canebridge.
<thelonepony> SuperBrony64: Mooooo :3
<DoubleDragonNeonFTW> If Disney bought out Hasbo, then I hope to god they don't change Dungeons and Dragons.
<VenHur> ...Too bad we don't had co-existing cartoons or cartoon physics in our life...
<LordDerpington> I've often wondered what it would be like to live in a world like in musicals, where people break out into spontaneous song and dance routines. That'd be interesting too.
<Zacklego> I hear that hasbro might be selling to disney
<DoubleDragonNeonFTW> It's already a bad WoW clone as it is.
<BronyDarth> WAIT FOR MEH
<Afflict> no
<AJIsAwesome> LordDerpington: It would also be very tiring and monotanous.
<LordDerpington> Zacklego: Nah, it was debunked.
<Kipkat07_USAF> Zacklego: NO GOD NO!!!

<Gekoncze> we have to read old books for example shakespeare, hemingway, sofokles... there are only a few good ones - for example from Tolkein
<Kipkat07_USAF> Zacklego: The fandom wouldnt allow for the purchase of MLP

<VenHur> Disney are secretly bronies!
<BronyDarth> My little Marvel, lucasfilm is pixar.
<Coey890> Disney needs to learn from Disney.
<Afflict> That's stupid
<Stary> Nope, especially is Disney is buying MLP
<Cyberlord> does this take place in the fifties.
<DoubleDragonNeonFTW> I know, they could though.
<VenHur> Your welcome for the hidden message.
<Metronome> ^^^^lol
<cachi01> Kipkat07_USAF: you think the star wars fandom would allow what happened?
<turtlegod98> Can I ask, What was the name of the video called when bronystate got hackedand there was that weird orange person with no body walking?
<AJIsAwesome> wipergone2: inb4 chat goes crazy
<Kipkat07_USAF> Cyberlord: 1947
<MadSurge> RRRGH STILL ON LIMEV?
<spyrofan001> 6i have to read lots of books like i have read over 20 in school
<cachi01> turtlegod98: idk maybe the hacer made it
<wipergone2> AJIsAwesome: and i know y

<Cyberlord> yep by a troll group
<Scootaloo-the-Awesom> Haters: Now hacking videos that explain why bullying is wrong
<Kipkat07_USAF> DoubleDragonNeonFTW: Not hacked
<VenHur> No, no, no...I'm just NAMING the companies Disney brought in an alphabetical order.
<SirGanjalf> Disney bought ENTIRE SW brand for 4 billion dollars. I wonder how much they'd have to pay to buy Hasbro.
<Canebridge> It was the stream, not Bronystate - Big difference
<Stary> Not just BronyState in particular
<Azuredragon> Glad i watched the ep on tv
<Gekoncze> I also know one joke about it, but it would be hard to translate from czech
<BronyDarth> Wait... DURING NEW EPISODE EARLIER?!
<CubedUranium> i'm sure the new star wars can never be as good as the first 6
<pony_6275> orangeperson with no legs moves likes jagger
<MadSurge> Well LimeV is "doing maintenance" on my end :[

<Stary> BronyDarth: Yeah
<Coey890> Guys... I really don't want Disney to steal our Ponies. ;_;
<BronyAlchemist> ?
<Kipkat07_USAF> Scootaloo-the-Awesom: yep. dont you love the world?
<Vordox> RainbowDerpy: Was not 4Chan, was BNAA
<VenHur> I just realised that M for Marvel, L for Lucasfilm, and P for Pixar combined into MLP.
<Coolbond> what a maroon!
<BronyDarth> Goodbye everyone.
<cachi01> we'll probably get hacked again
<PartyCannon> oh boy
<MadSurge> Aye
<wipergone2> BronyAlchemist: calling us horse fucker is bullying
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> skip to 12:13
<VenHur> Which MEANS...it's a sign of what's to come!
<Michael> RainbowDerpy: it was GNAA not 4chan
<DinkyDoo> Disney would ruin Ponies.
<Canebridge> Darn.. Don't wanna be picking a knife up while the train passes by
<CubedUranium> yeah
<BronyAlchemist> Tis the internet
<Coey890> VenHur: HOLY DERP
<Cajun> I love Chilly Willy. Let's help him sue whoever he wants.
<BronyAlchemist> talking is much harder than ignoring

<Kipkat07_USAF> OH. SHIT.

<Moopy> Guys we need to track down the hackers and get revenge on there asses
<Zompony> EVERYMANS dream girl in 3...
<LordDerpington> Cajun: Daffy was that retarded to begin with. His conniving characteristics came in later.
<DoctoDoctorWho1> Moopy: Option 1, mutilate them viscously. Option 2. Love and tolerate. Option 3. Assimilation.
<IMMABRONY> and they completely dodged the point by hijacking it
<Zompony> 2...
<RainbowCrash> duck and cover
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> that pokemon hack is pretty cool, he basically builds a bootstrap using nothing but the inventory system which allows him to input his machine code midi player along with the PNG balloons image and the mlp midi themesong near the end.
<DoubleDragonNeonFTW> If I see Felix the Cat in this, then I can die a happy Brony coat
<Azuredragon> Are your badies ready?

<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: Just don't post that in mane chat.
<Tovler> he literally was like a brudda to me
<Lasharus> It's just that the question's been asked approx. 50 times. :P
<Coey890> But the ponies can fight back.
<Kipkat07_USAF> prince-dari: Well now I hate humans even more
<VenHur> prince-dari: Don't SAY such a thing!
<cachi01> AJIsAwesome: yeah it show the room

<cachi01> .
<cowvarkian> ..
<cachi01> mm
<prince-dari> Moopy: We'll look for an alternative since a lot of people can't see LimeV, but we likely won't be going back to mips for a long time.
<cachi01> ololo
<cachi01> popopo
<Zamer> prine-dari i just realized something ironic about GNAA's brony statement
<cachi01> pipipip
<DoubleDragonNeonFTW> I'm kind of in and out of the film.
<pony_6275> why did the spy cross the road
<Lil_B> Coey890 no prop :) I'm doing the opposite :)

<cachi01> mah biscuits r burning
<LordDerpington> So what was it, prince-dari ? Is there a security hole in MIPS system?
<Azuredragon> No blood?
<CubedUranium> OMG YES
<cowvarkian> I read that as how to fly like a kite
<DoubleDragonNeonFTW> I feel bad now, there's a lot of questions going on about the hacking.
<Kipkat07_USAF> oh god that looks gruesome
<DRHUnleashed> fairly clean
<BronyAlchemist> Lovely
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<prince-dari> Looks as though they got our stream info, which probably means either we got hacked, or mips got hacked.
<JustSomeRandomGuy> OH GOD
<Canebridge> Must've been.. Painless
<CubedUranium> im ALWAYS like: "why the hell is the moon here, its like 13:00"
<prince-dari> We're not entirely sure though.
<Zamer> it's probably mips
<Tervicz> Well, in a sense these are Cyberterrorists, no?
<pony_6275> the have invaded ourstream
<pony_500990> haters gonna hate
<pony_6275> and worst of all
<Zamer> but then again it did happen to a lot of other streams as well
<CubedUranium> freaking ACME

<Coey890> No... :'(
<Algent> prince-dari: Just checked, I can see the stream fine directly on limev. So I guess it's not ISP block
<DoubleDragonNeonFTW> Nope...but that doesn't sound like a bad idea. :)
<aniderp> slap
<Kipkat07_USAF> bitchslap
<Iwa> DinkyDoo: Oily salt popcorn, right here...just warmed right now :)

<SirGanjalf> "Vhere is ze Ark, dr Jones?"

<AJIsAwesome> I forgot to vote. :$
<spyrofan001> 6bye
<IshPonyPonyThePony> Eli it was a joke
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I forgot to vote as well.
<prince-dari> Ok
<IshPonyPonyThePony> I....think I voted
<prince-dari> First result
<Eli> IshPonyPonyThePony: i know. but playing oblivious is so much fun :D
<prince-dari> Number 24, XylemTube with Air Force One for A
<FlaschenJoe11> I think too IshPonyPonyThePony
<prince-dari> Gunna check IMDb
<RaveBrony> I cant vote for A :(
<cachi01> aur force one?
<EspyLacopa> Air Force One is a Harrison Ford movie.
<cachi01> air*
<RaveBrony> 2 more weeks until i can, i think
<Vordox> Errr
<Vordox> Is Air Force One an A movie
<Vordox> Or B Movie?
<Tovler> get off my plane
<Vordox> It feels like a B movie imo, but the stats tells otherwise.
<Eli> i'll bee right back
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's an A movie.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Lottery \:D/
<Tovler> the movie was a big deal at the time.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Harrison Ford.
<prince-dari> Ok, we have our A
<EspyLacopa> Do you know who Harrison Ford is? He's the main lead.
<Vordox> Yeah but is it a GOOD movie to be an A?
<prince-dari> On to the B film
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moo ^-^
<Tovler> 6.3 good enough
<Vordox> EspyLacopa: One actor makes not a movie, it's several =P
<EspyLacopa> Since did "A Movie" mean good?
<AJIsAwesome> Ohai, SB. :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai :3
<cowvarkian> ohai
<AJIsAwesome> You missed the cows, SB. :<
<Ponies47> Dat SuperBrony64 :3
<prince-dari> Number 41, Deacon with Cinderella (1997)
<Vordox> EspyLacopa: So you would say Titanic is an A Movie? =P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moo? o.o
<EspyLacopa> Considering the budget? Yes.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02How was the episode this morning? :D
<AJIsAwesome> It was good. :)
<prince-dari> Oh God it looks horrifying
<cowvarkian> we were hijacked a couple times
<IshPonyPonyThePony> inb4 another hack
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64, We got hijacked ;_;
<EspyLacopa> The definition of "B Movie" is that it's a low-budget film
<AJIsAwesome> And a cult-classic. :3
<Stormy> I was in a pokemon RP once for like 5 posts, really didn't get into it much
<prince-dari> Yep, we have our B film
<Vordox> Cinderella
<Vordox> 1997
<EspyLacopa> Nah
<Tovler> "Impossible.. things are happening eeeeveryyyy daaaay"
<Vordox> Updated version of the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical of the classic fairy-tale, with an all-star, multi-racial cast.
<prince-dari> Pony eps now
<EspyLacopa> Cult Classics are typically low budget movies (B Movies) that somehow managed to be very popular.
<EspyLacopa> Frequently after it's run at the theatres has finished.
<Vordox> Hammerstein sounds familiar, and usually a good movie director
<Tovler> This was a TV special
<prince-dari> Number 66, Dark92Enigma, with A Canterlot Wedding Pt 1
<Vordox> EspyLacopa: So FF Spirit Within is an A movie?
<Vordox> :P
<Tovler> Now I don't wanna pick Fiddler on the Roof for A :(
<EspyLacopa> No idea.
<AJIsAwesome> Sweet, so we have 3 pony episodes to watch next week. :3
<Vordox> I'vve been a normal Bronystater for over almost 1 and a half year it feels like
<prince-dari> And finally number 25, Mekapi, with Elements of Harmony Pt 1
<Vordox> Haven't won once. :D
<EspyLacopa> In the end. . .it's frequently going to vary from viewer to viewer if a particular movie is A or B because noone seems to agree on a solid definition.
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<prince-dari> Hah, two two parters
<meowmatry> hello
<AJIsAwesome> 4 eps to watch. :O
<prince-dari> So, we have our lineup
<RaveBrony> :L
<prince-dari> A - Air Force One - XylemTube
<Ponies47> Damn 2 2 part episodes O.O
<AJIsAwesome> So I'm guessing it's going to be a long BMN? :D
<Vordox> No
<prince-dari> B - Cinderella (1997) - Deacon
<RaveBrony> Nah
<AJIsAwesome> Ah, okay.
<prince-dari> Pony 1 - A Canterlot Wedding Pt1 - Dark92Enigma
<RaveBrony> They probably wont do the full things
<prince-dari> Pony 2 - Elements of Harmony Pt1 - Mekapi
<SpeccyRush> Where was Gondor when the 2 parter has been doubled
<Alchemist> prince-dari: how many people send in nominations usually for a lottery?
<Zamer> OMG that B Movie looks horrifying
<Tovler> nnnnnn Air Force One is as bad as Firewall and Cinderella has a ton of songs.
<prince-dari> Alchemist: Click subscribe on our main page

<Indigo_Sky> if there's an A movie, chances are there's a B movie replicating it
<Ryunosuke> prince-dari: I think what he is asking is what is the average number of polls submitted a week :)
<CCharmanderK> I went to the newsletter area, but it said there weren't any available surveys!
<SpadeMagnes[School> What defines a A and B movie?
<fr4nky> a musical of cinderella
<DerpyMuffins_> Harrison Ford=A movie to the mods

<Malmortius> Thank god that piece of shit movie is over
<J_E_Smith71> prince-dari: Normally you show two parters after the B movie, what will you do for having two two parters?
<Tovler> nnnnnn Air Force One is as bad as Firewall and Cinderella has a ton of songs. :'(
<Ryunosuke> so its anywhere from 100-130 usually
<CCharmanderK> Great, now I feel like a dumbshit.
<Malmortius> now are we going to watch something thats actually entertaining?
<AJIsAwesome> Malmortius: Roger Rabbit?
<Cajun> Hulk Vs.

<Zamer> Malmortius you don't like Roger Rabbit?
<CCharmanderK> Still, I'm angry and sad that nopony was helping me when I was asking for it.
<dritory> civilization!
<fr4nky> roger rabbit is a good movie

<otakon17> It?
<Malmortius> Whats being played now?
<ifiredmylazar> he wanted more attention, but then gak happened
<Cajun> Sombra is best villian, just worst characterization

*AJTheMightyGamer puts a hat on cachi01
<CriticKitten> But for those who haven't seen Skyfall yet, let me sum it up for you: it's "The Dark Knight" and "Bourne" in different colored wrapping, executed a bit more poorly, and while it's a good movie....it's still not Bond.
<AJIsAwesome> Spy: Oh, dear. You've made quite a mess.
<Worgeral> poor kid

<fr4nky> moonrise kingdom?
<King> King
<CriticKitten> Tovler: Avengers wins that hands down for me
<AzureIllusion> Seems physics
<Kandarihu> Cyberlord, I suppose any workable strategy would involve gaining his trust, and catching him when he's Bruce Banner.
<Spy> Be friendlyto someone and they will turn into a toad
<AJTheMightyGamer> :$
<VenHur> prince-dari: So how about in honor of James Bond's 50th aniversary, we do a marathon of every single films up to Skyfall? Sounds good for a deal?
<MadSurge> ^

<AJIsAwesome> *^^
<prince-dari> VenHur: Thats...A lot of Bond films

<SpadeMagnes[School> Ok...so what pissed off Banner this time
<SweetieG4K> so hulk is bigfoot o.O
<Tovler> Moonrise Kingdom was like an old chapter book I read as a kid come to life. It hit me hard

<YokusaHHart> seriously, Where's Heimdall?
<Vordox> While holding it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm asking some others what it could be. Hang on.
<Rex_Mundi> This comic series rapes mythology
<red_ony> that's not how a hammer works
<VenHur> Now we need Hulk Vs Dan Vs [anything random]
<Record_Discord> VenHur: WHAT???
<SpadeMagnes[School> So who the hell is this?
<Eagle> I throw my hammer in the air some times saying eeeeeyooo
<CriticKitten> So wait, then if Baldur is blowing Baldur's Horn, then did the Hulk just break Baldur's Gate? O.o

<thelonepony> SpadeMagnes[School: think of him as a Homoncula from FMA
<SpadeMagnes[School> HAMMER OF DAWN AWAY!
<YokusaHHart> wait....doesn't Baldur's death iniciate Ragnarok?
<VenHur> Record_Discord: What? Don't like the idea? Blasphemy!
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeMagnes[School: They are the type of god that can die, but are fatedly impossible to kill untill ragnarock because thats when the universe says they die.
<Vordox> YokusaHHart: Indeed
<prince-dari> Dem moves
<red_ony> dat drama
<Record_Discord> VenHur: I myself am blasphemy, friend.
<Vordox> NOPE
<SpadeMagnes[School> How does Thor know about the Hulk? He met him before?
<ifiredmylazar> this is like a soap oprah
<Vordox> noone in there
<FlaschenJoe11> Hulk > Immortal Evils
<Zamer> SapdeMagnes[School the Asgards aren't technically gods, they are aliens but humans see them as gods
<NullRadix> Puny underling holds gate for 10 minutes. Thor loses it in 30 seconds
<fr4nky> banner isnt in the beast
<YokusaHHart> Norse Mythology ftw!
<Eagle> Say what!

<ifiredmylazar> round 1... FIGHT
<Ryunosuke> its hammer time
<Vordox> Guys. that hammer is SO powerful. you won't be able to comprehend it
<Record_Discord> Cyberlord: Hulk, and smash.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SpadeMagnes[School: :D so Microsoft is working for Loki?
<Rex_Mundi> I always disliked the idea of comic books shanghaiing mythology, so unoriginal
<SpadeMagnes[School> So what good does beating up the hulk do if he cant be stopped?
<red_ony> now for 15 min of pounding I guess
<CriticKitten> So she's an evil enchantress....
<pony_4908> Blaze: Because then Marvel wouldn't be able to squeeze money out of him anymore? :D
<FlaschenJoe11> Cyberlord: Depends on the Time. During World War Hulk, he could speak full sentences.
<Record_Discord> CriticKitten: She does evil dances...
<Ryunosuke> CriticKitten: she does evil dances
<Dashie_Dashie> Norse god vs. Geneticly mutated human.
<Starlight_Phoenix> what happened in hulk vs wolverine?

<CriticKitten> Probably mix up an evil brew

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> CriticKitten: and if you look into her eyes,she will put yout in trances! :D
<Zamer> YokusaHHart it's not that it's weaker, it's just that it against the Hulk
<Eli> trollhammer
<SpadeMagnes[School> So if Banner is the only thing that can stop the hulk, what would beating him up do?
<Record_Discord> Haha still weak

<Vordox> prince-dari: a twsited version
<TrixieMuffin> Hel , not Hell
<Blaze> Oh look.... Hell.
<Kencolt> Frost Giants. For some reason the listen to Loki. They are mighty, strong, and none to bright.
<Zamer> prince-dari yes but Thor forced Loki to send his soldiers to stop Hulk
<FlaschenJoe11> Loki never visits his daughter.
<billy> what an awful dad
<Cyberlord> why is it when someone says "for asgard" they get destroyed by the hulk?
<Eli> "As long as i lived i hoped never to see this realm" it's the realm of the dead you genius....
<VenHur> It was all a dream...
<reddawn> he is alive?
<Vordox> Kencolt: Loki is half God Half Giant
<SpadeMagnes[School> Why do the frost giants follow loki?
<pony_4908> Sleipnir?
<VenHur> Everything was all a dream!
<r-dash> ping
<Zamer> half Asgard not God Vordox
<pony_4908> And you were there, and you were there, too! :O
<Record_Discord> GODDAMNIT VenHur NOT ANNNOTHER ONE OF THOSE EPISODES
<Blaze> It was all a dream... A crazy, crazy dream!
<Vordox> Zamer: No, I'm pretty sure he's half God. :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> prince-dari: Does nopony pay attention? Thor told loki to send his dark forces to battle the hulk! sheesh
<Vordox> <--- OH SHIT
<Vordox> OH SHIT
<Dashie_Dashie> lolwut?
<FlaschenJoe11> Sleipnir and Hela are brethren.
<Vordox> THIS IS BAD
<Record_Discord> WHOOOOOOOOOOOOHAHAHA WHO'S THE BROAD?
<Vordox> THIS IS FRICKING BAD
<red_ony> the script for this must be awesome...and then hulk fights this guy but goes away and fights this guy...and than that one..but the other one came back with friends and then they fight some more and...
<SpadeMagnes[School> Bruce had a wife?
<Kencolt> Vordox: Which explains a lot about his plans. Clever? Yes. Tricky? Yes. Bright? Not so much, apparently.
<Vordox> He's in the paradise. SHIT SHIT SHIT
<Zamer> yes Spade
<Dashie_Dashie> Giggity.
<Record_Discord> WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT??????
<CriticKitten> >daddy
<Cyberlord> a child.
<Vordox> The norse Paradise, worst place EVER
<prince-dari> DoctoDoctorWho: Yeah, I'm not really paying attention, mod things to deal with. :P
<fr4nky> he has kids?
<CriticKitten> WAT
<SweetieG4K> this is dah future
<billy> woulndt hulk sex make her infertile?
<SpadeMagnes[School> Bruce had a son? What the fuck?
<AJTheMightyGamer> its a dream within a dream
<reddawn> he ded
<ifiredmylazar> that is a bad idea
<Blaze> So... is it Valhalla?
<Dashie_Dashie> JK YOUR IN HELL
<Metasate> WUT?
<Vordox> Blaze: No
<Sundaysmile> He's in the Matrix
<CriticKitten> Ohai Hela
<Kencolt> This is the life he should have had-- were it not for the Hulk.
<ifiredmylazar> hes the hulk and he has kids
<Blaze> Vordox: Then where is he?
<DoctoDoctorWho> prince-dari: Fine, I guess thats a decent enough excuse
<Record_Discord> A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM http://inception.davepedu.com/
<Vordox> Blaze: The past wall of Valhalla
<SpadeMagnes[School> How hellish would it be to have everything you could ever want, but know it isnt real or right?
<cachi01> iirc he had a daughter. she was also a hulk and her sister is also hul
<Record_Discord> I'll see myself out
<Blaze> .....What, Vordox?
<Vordox> <--- Loves Norse Myths
<CriticKitten> Thor, you forgot to throw your hammer at her head before you speak to her
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: Look! See? Hela!
<YokusaHHart> Vordox: Same here
<cowvarkian> SpadeMagnes[School: that doesn't seem that bad
<Vordox> Blaze: If you were a hero, you'll go to Valhalla, where you fight till you die, once you die in Valhalla you go to Paradise
<SpadeMagnes[School> So Hella is the norse equivalent of hades?
<Zamer> cachi01 no that was his cousin who was also a hulk, he did have a son on another planet though as the hulk
*Vordox does tableflip at DoctoDoctorWho
<Dashie_Dashie> dat bargaining
<red_ony> back to punching
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: Nope, Valhalla is infininte warrior respawn heaven
<Blaze> Ooohhh.... Sorry, I only know Greek myths. I should read more Norse myths.
<TrixieMuffin> Valhalla is the "heaven" for Warriors , all whodont die in battle and get picked by the valkyries goto Hel (the general underworld) and there get tortured/rewarded
<YokusaHHart> yeah, Valhalla is not Paradise. More of a waiting room
<SpadeMagnes[School> Your a wizard hulk
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: You forgot something
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: This is the TWISTED version
<ifiredmylazar> wood does not act like that
<Vordox> Which is different
<reddawn> hulk is a muscle wizard
<Kencolt> Vordox: Actually, you just get up again, eat a LOT, and fight the next day-- or so the original myths went. Vikings were fond of eating and fighting.
<Iwa> Wasn't Valhalla a Perpetual battlefield, with a nice dinner and sleep between the battles? :P
<DinkyDoo> KISSSSSS
<cowvarkian> Iwa: I thought so
<Blaze> Just kidding, you're in HEEEEEEEEEEL
<cachi01> Iwa: yep heaven for warrior
<cachi01> s
<Vordox> Kencolt: Indeed, but we're looking at THIS version of Americanized it :P
<prince-dari> He was happy for once in his life (lolgeddit)
<prince-dari> And this happens
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: True, Im trying to explain the real myth, wheras this is marvel, where they screwed up everything. sorry /)
<Vordox> prince-dari: Eeyup
<ifiredmylazar> cockblocked
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: *(\ I'm geting confused too, but I'm keeping up :P
<Blaze> DAMNIT, NOT LIFE AGAIN!

<DoctoDoctorWho> prince-dari: Eye c wut u did thar
<DinkyDoo> The stream keeps freezing.. for me, at least..
<AJTheMightyGamer> I AM SAXTON HULK! President and CEO of MANN CO, and the man who is going to BURN YOU HOUSE DONW! :[

<Cyberlord> Bruce Banner: the only marvel character that is more depressing than spider man
<reddawn> the hulk is the god of rage
<Blaze> Kills Thor, dies by crows

<TrixieMuffin> Heimdall is watching Bifrost

<SGT_01G4K38FS> how was your day HoodyNinja? :)
<cowvarkian> yes
<Vordox> Zamer: Actually, the marvel version is mixed
<weeping_pegasi8> ghosts
<billy> who ya gonna call?
<DerpyMuffins> J_E_Smith71 Norse, not greek
<Vordox> There's Greek and Norse in this version
<HoodyNinja> SGT_01G4K38FS: Lazy -_-
<Vordox> Which is why it's twisted.
<HoodyNinja> Shit
<Kotano> HULK SMASH GHOST
<DoctoDoctorWho> J_E_Smith71: Marvel done fucked this one up, and this is norse btw :P
<weeping_pegasi82> loki
<YokusaHHart> Loki is bad father
<Dashie_Dashie> Whose that VA?
<Starlight_Phoenix> at least if banner was going to die, he wouldn''t be going far
<Zamer> I haven't seen no Greek Mytho in this so far
<fr4nky> billy: Gkost Busters!
<Dashie_Dashie> that sounded like trixie.
<HoodyNinja> Who had gack in their name?

<DerpyMuffins> Die alone
<SpadeMagnes[School> It was your fault Loki
<J_E_Smith71> Meant to say Norse:p
<Vordox> THERE IS NO HELL in Norse myth ffs =P
<HoodyNinja> There is
<HoodyNinja> It's called Hel
<Contron> remember, this monster is really just an innocent man who owns a laboratory ;)
<ifiredmylazar> but there is an underworld
<DerpyMuffins> It's Hella
<billy> hel is the realm of the dead
<AskPeachy> howdy everypony Bad Apple was an awesome CMC episode, was it not? :$
<Zamer> actually there is Vodox
<SpringWonder> The Underworld.
<SGT_01G4K38FS> lol Vordox what is norse? :P
<YokusaHHart> it's Helhiem
<Vordox> Yes there is a unerworld
<billy> but true warriors go to valhalla
<Blaze> Vordox: But Hel and Hell are pronounced the same, right?
<Vordox> Yeah YokusaHHart
<SpadeMagnes[School> So if you die in hell does that make you double dead?
<J_E_Smith71> AskPeachy: Song was nice
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: not hell specificly, but there is niffelheim, Muspelheim, and valhalla
<Starlight_Phoenix> anyone getting a laggy stream?

<r-dash> i love how the hulk was just in canida now he is in hell
<DinkyDoo> Starlight_Pheonix: Yeah.
<ifiredmylazar> the death has been DOUBLED
<Kencolt> Vordox: Actually, there is. It's basically a no-place where those who didn't die in battle went. Just a big dull place with nothing happening... kinda like Purgatory.
<YokusaHHart> <<Norse Mythology nerd :$
<fr4nky> babs seeds ^^
<cowvarkian> AskPeachy: hey look, someone discussing ponies on bronystate, haven't seen that in a while
<Vordox> Kencolt: That's Helheim

<Boltasar> ...
<billy> his secret is that he is the god of hoes
<TrixieMuffin> Thor being real doesnt proove the legends about him or the norse religion , in much the same way that the fact that NewYork exists doesnt proove the exisance of Spiderman
<Record_Discord> I got tired no more
*cowvarkian wanted to be ping spammed....
<SGT_01G4K38FS> Record_Discord: how was your day? :)
<Record_Discord> I promise
<Sundaysmile> and Odin was totally oblivious
<Kotano> "Did I miss something?"
<Record_Discord> So tired
<Record_Discord> I'm done
<Zamer> Fun Fact, Odin was pretending to sleep the entire time

<Blaze> Starlight_Phoenix: He IS a pony! Roid Rage!"
<r-dash> needs more deadpool but it gets a 8/10
<Kencolt> Dashie_Dashie: Actually, in the TV series-- or rather the followup movies-- Banner eventually died and the Hulk with him.
<Kotano> SGT_01G4K38FS: You mean one bad apple?Yeah,I've seen it.Probably gonna stay for the rerun,though
<Canadian_Brony> I didn't get to see the episode here (for shame) and I heard BronyState got hacked. Is this true?
<Vordox> FANDRAL STAGHELM
<Vordox> cough

<Benjojo> Man thats annoying
<Benjojo> :V
<billy> yeah, but thtas true for any adaptation
<Iwa> Nittany_Discord: I initially read it as French Tickler...Heh...:P

<J_E_Smith71> SGT_01G4K38FS: Pinkie and Derpy
<cowvarkian> Zamer: how would that even work
<Canadian_Brony> r-dash it's to avoid spoilers for those who haven't seen the episode, but I CAN tell you that I absolutely love it.
<LordDerpington> This music is so like the theme to the Merlin miniseries from about fifteen years ago.
<SGT_01G4K38FS> hi gunny
<billy> was it when he was ww hulk?
<gunny> hello SGT_01G4K38FS
<Kandarihu> Given the GNAA attack, I think the spoiler rule timer should be reset when it's screened after BMN
<billy> i really wanted roger rabbit...
<gunny> :oooooooo
<AJTheMightyGamer> pony time
<Eli> i don't think there's any canon in marvel stuff... each new writer or filmmaker does his own thing
<gunny> SGT_01G4K38FS, you broke the filter!
<AJTheMightyGamer> yay
<gunny> XD
<TrixieMuffin> it felt "short" and uneventfull , but that might be due to the protagonists
<ifiredmylazar> there we go
<Dashie_Dashie> PONIES
<DinkyDoo> TIME FOR PONIES
<Welsh_Pony> Missed the lottery, what won?
<AJTheMightyGamer> I love this episode
<SweetieG4K> Its pony time
<prince-dari> Run Lola run
<Dashie_Dashie> Hello there Yellow Quiet.
<DinkyDoo> Boo, lags.
<gunny> so KarugaKun
<Kandarihu> Eli, yes, but they still build off of what the previous writer did. That's why dead characters keep coming back to life.
<J_E_Smith71> You're not Alice, Fluttershy
<spitfirecolt> ya what won guys
<Red_Pegasus> DING DING
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man Angel needs a sticky note or something :D
<DinkyDoo> LAG.
<Ryunosuke> inb4 trollestia
<Kencolt> I seem to remember more than a few fanworks dressing Fluttershy up as Alice.
<J_E_Smith71> spitfirecolt: Air Force One and Cinderella
<Zamer> cowvarkian it was in the Marval Zombie storyline, Hulk and Galactus fought and Hulk killed and ate him
<Kotano> was that Pinkie's Dress there in her closet?
<AJTheMightyGamer> why does fluttershy have most of the other ponies dresses?
<SweetieG4K> i need to go good bye evrypony
<Vordox> lol
<cowvarkian> Zamer: that shouldnt work
<gunny> bye sweetie.
<Worgeral> my little pony
<Dashie_Dashie> Yellowquiet is cutest pony.
<spitfirecolt> sweet i love those movies
<fr4nky> chat lags?
<prince-dari> I love this scene
<AJTheMightyGamer> lag
<alexxm> so this should be good
<HoodyNinja> Dammit Lime
<Kotano> see ya SweetieG4K
<Ryunosuke> later SweetieG4K
<Kandarihu> One writer will kill off a particular character, and the next writer liked that character, so his story will involve the character coming back to life. The only thing that can KEEP a character dead is a memo saying not to bring that particular character back
<HoodyNinja> Oh S1
<gunny> G4K
<HoodyNinja> latas Sweetie
<gunny> nice.
<Kencolt> AJTheMightyGamer: Probably because Rarity had no more room, this was shortly before the Gala. And Rarity was making LOTS of dresses.
<prince-dari> Dash u so cute
<LordDerpington> erblblblblbbl!
<crazypony> lol
<Worgeral> trololol

<Zamer> Galactus sadly isn't as powerful as people made him out to be being a planet eater and all
<25AAAAKHI> the chat was buggy
<DRHUnleashed> didnt know they had internet in africa
<Dashie_Dashie> prince-dari: I found this in my pony folder just for you. http://i.imgur.com/S7aDI.gif
<cowvarkian> I wondered when that nigerian prince would finally die, DocSane
<25AAAAKHI> why i have dat name?

<Moopy> Gotcha!

<spitfirecolt> did the cakes make the same sound like pinkie
<AJTheMightyGamer> yes
<ifiredmylazar> I DIDN'T SAY IT
<DocSane> KinsagaKing: Yeah, I watched on TV directly while watching the chat on my laptop.
<RivaLz> Phoenix allmost dies ---> Celestia is completely ok with that :D
<Kandarihu> KinsagaKing, the Cakes were refilling her cup with tea every time she took a sip, so she pretended to take a sip without actually drinking anything and they overfilled her cup
<gunny> XD
<ifiredmylazar> lol

<ShadowQuill> ifiredmylazar: Why are they getting kicked?
<DocSane> Oooh...

<DocSane> Clever.
<CCCP> /v/ is the most boring board

<ShadowQuill> SO..... LITTLE...... BUFFER.....
<AJTheMightyGamer> why doesnt she put blanket and ice patch

<Zamer> cowvarkian http://derpy.me/H9wz-
<ponyguy> lol wat ep is this
<DocSane> I found it funny that the bullying episode was disrupted by bullies.
<ShadowQuill> ifiredmylazar: That commercial?
<ShadowQuill> Floam?
<ifiredmylazar> yes
<Vordox> I was the ONLY one who noticed his name? :P
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Watch it Ralph / The Plan / Breaking Babs / Hoof Trick / The Fluttershy Incident
<KinsagaKing> ShadowQuill: hello! I like ponies. :)
<CCCP> Hi KingsagaKing!!!

<ShadowQuill> KinsagaKing: HELLO!
<Kandarihu> DocSane, and there's talk of retaliation for the attack.
<ifiredmylazar> it is stupid. i got kicked and i did even say it
<Vordox> ShadowQuill: Kinsaga-King <-- :P
<ekips> I think there is a conspiracy going on with Kinsaga King ..
<ShadowQuill> Wrek: I didn't even say the word!!!
<DocSane> Kandarihu: Are they building a giant apple float and tricking the /v/ guys onto it?
<gunny> how so ekips?
<Vinylscratch> chugga woo woo!!
<Vordox> I say Kinsaga-King is a GREAT troll :D
<ekips> gunny everybody who is pingin him gets kicked
<r-dash> every bodys watching mlp while im just watching winter gak up
<ShadowQuill> Oh.
<[Derpy]> Hmm
<MegaKoala> Well, if you can't beat em, join em.
<[Derpy]> g-ak
<KinsagaKing> hi ther [Derpy]
<KinsagaKing> :3
<Jazmyn> kagkagkag
<ShadowQuill> Kinsaga: Hey, what's up?
<[Derpy]> Hello :P
<RivaLz> Kinsa[gaK]ing lol i just realized that hahah
<Dashie_Dashie> YELLOWQUIET, WHY ARE YOU SO GODDAMN CUTE.
<ShadowQuill> RivaLz: Fail
<Jazmyn> ahhh
<DinkyDoo> SHE SINGS SO MAJESTICLY.
<red_ony> why is the word banned anyway? does spamming it break the chat?
<DinkyDoo> EW,
<Iwa> MegaKoala: Or don't mind 'em :)
<RivaLz> xDDDDDD
<J_E_Smith71> It wasn't /v/ though it was other guys. Probably used /v/ as a cover to get the Bronies to go get revenge on them, and they laugh as everyone makes fools of themselves
<KarugaKun> hi there Kinsaga­King
<ShadowQuill> red_ony: It got annoying
<Kandarihu> DocSane, no, just going to war against GNAA and everything.
<Jazmyn> who hacked us
<KinsagaKing> hi Karuga Kun
<pony_8866> I fell asleep while the Hulk was tearing up Asgard, wha'd I miss?
<RivaLz> ok ffs i never ever will mention that green floam stuff ever AGAIN!
<ShadowQuill> Karuga: You did it as well
<Vordox> J_E_Smith71: It's mostly solved with /V/ and Bronies at 4chan
<Vordox> They know it was g-naa
<Zamer> ren_ony because a certain commercial was spammed on the Hub today and during the season premier
<Kencolt> That's not a humidifier. That's a radiator, an old method of apartment heating that is so out of date, I can't even-- it's old even to ME.
<AJTheMightyGamer> damn my computer derped.... what happend?
<Jazmyn> rarity sneeze
<String_Shredder> Jazmyn: It said /v/ but Scoot-Scootaloo suspects the GNAA
<KarugaKun> ShadowQuill: did what? g­a­k?
<Sundaysmile> TETSUO!
<Jazmyn> hmm... i c...
<[Derpy]> o.o
<ShadowQuill> karuga: WHY?
<KinsagaKing> AJTheMightyGamer: I made the ponies. Who is your favoirte? :)
<pony_8866> KANEDA!
<J_E_Smith71> That's useless ointment if it cause bumps to appear
<Vordox> String_Shredder: It was the GN-AA
<DocSane> I was kind of underwhelmed by the episode today.
<Kandarihu> Yes. The GNAA attack was a false-flag attack implicating /v/ which would've worked if they hadn't declared war on us 2 weeks ago.
<DocSane> Ending seemed a little too pat.
<KarugaKun> ShadowQuill: my ga­­k is on white list :)
<AJTheMightyGamer> KingsagaKing: Rainbow Dash is my favorite
<Kencolt> The GNAA practically admittedit on their Twitter thingy.
<prince-dari> It was fairly amusing
<gunny> hello SweetieG4K
<RivaLz> xD someones got kicked again haha
<Metasate> gtg bye everypony!
<Vinylscratch> FLUTTERTHEIF!!!
<DocSane> Who ARE the GNAA?

<AJTheMightyGamer> i got kicked for telling someone my favorite pony:'(
<[Derpy]> LOL

<KinsagaKing> :)
<Kandarihu> prince-dari, it'll be even better for you when we watch S03E04 in it's entirety first while you're streaming it.
<J_E_Smith71> DocSane: Their full name is too ugly to say in here
<ifiredmylazar> they are stupid
<Vordox> AJTheMightyGamer: Nah, Kinsaga-King has a part of the name that's interesting XD
<RivaLz> hi Kinsa******** xD
<KarugaKun> AJTheMightyGamer: that's so cruel, but you can hug me
<ifiredmylazar> you dont SAY
<DocSane> Oh, those guys. They went after MLP videos on YouTube, didn't they?
<RivaLz> i wont fall for that joke again :P
<AJTheMightyGamer> KarugaKun: /me hugs
<Zamer> Aek Aek Aek
<[Derpy]> hmm
<Kencolt> DocSane: Basically, a pack of pointless trollers-- they admit as much. Their entire reason is to troll, hack, and annoy, because they find it amusing. In other words, losers. Yes, I went there. Losers.
<red_ony> tuberculosis?
<AJTheMightyGamer> ... :'(
<MegaKoala> RivaLz: you sure about that?

<UncouthLurker> there is nothing wrong with g­ak
<SpadeMagnes[School> I dont know why but I enjoy pounding the people who act tough into the ground
<Sonicrainboom_BOOM> y the hate for G4k?
<Spy> pricess
<SpadeMagnes[School> I dont know why I enjoy it
<Deacon> so, heard some people hijacked the stream
<Serenity> SpadeMagnes[School: I know that feel bro
<Jazmyn> yep
<thelonepony> Sonicrainboom_BOOM: because of spam
<GreatNector> why are they obsessed with it?
<CCCP> Hai thelonepony having server problems?
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> It was hard
<GilDash> Deacon: Yeah. Was interesting.
<thelonepony> Deacon: eeyup
<Welsh_Pony> Hi again CCCP
<cachi01> http://imgur.com/M20Ff :I
<BerryPunch> Title on imgur.com: imgur: the simple image sharer
<Dashie_Dashie> >MandoPony is now working with the creators of MLP on an episode.
<King> gak
<EpicMario50> Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyup
<Dashie_Dashie> well it was nice knowing you mlp.
<Sonicrainboom_BOOM> Does anyone even know how?
<cachi01> remember remember the 24th of november
<LadyCanary> >______________<
<GilDash> 'Twas certainly a departure from the norm. XD
<[Derpy]> Why not just block the word g-ak? Kicking seems a bit overkill
<[Derpy]> :p
<Serenity> Hey, Dashie_Dashie It's been a long long time
<AJIsAwesome> Eeyup.
<Deacon> Dashie_Dashie and that's a problem why?
<gunny> Derpy slurpy silly mail-mare muffin Derpy~
<Dashie_Dashie> Sup Serenity.
<EpicMario50> asdfmovie 5000
<gunny> :3
<CCCP> Hi Derpy_Hooves King
<GreatNector> can i ask everypony a question?
<cowvarkian> nah, i think Ill forget it
<SpadeMagnes[School> Cause people dont know when to quit
<King> Guys, look up 'nekci menijshow' on google. you can thank me later
<GilDash> Dashie_Dashie: Really? Well, it seems as though MLP might be disappearing after all...
<Serenity> That depends what it is
<Dashie_Dashie> Deacon, Fanpandering usually leads to the dead of shows.
<cachi01> remember remember the 24th of november
<cowvarkian> because it was silly and unnecessary
<Canadian_Brony> GreatNector sure, I guess.
<thelonepony> CCCP: nope, flash and internet
<cowvarkian> just like terrorism
<Dashie_Dashie> death*
<CCCP> Oh
<Yellowquiet> we only watch mlp for the gak ad XD
<LadyCanary> ...
<fr4nky1> my stream pauses itself
<Derpy_Hooves> hai gunny hai CCCP :3
<Kurra> Mine too.
<Deacon> Dashie_Dashie well I doubt he would that pandering
<Jazmyn> no stream nuuuuuuuuuu
<gunny> me too
<kirbuu> mine too
<EpicMario50> so does mine
<gunny> wat.
<ekips> yay, server downtime in 5 minutes..
<Jazmyn> yay
<GreatNector> what are we gonna name Princess Cadence and Shining Armor combine?
<King> was there any ak-gay ads during todays episode
<Serenity> GilDash: Rightly so tbh, there's so many fucktard ponyfags, around 90%. If that dies down, reputation will improve
<gunny> Wrek, LimeV is derping
<gunny> ._.
<GilDash> LadyCanary: You're better just ignoring them. If they don't figure it out, they don't figure it out. XD
<CCCP> Hi hi SpitFire and Cyberlord and wub!
<GreatNector> like fusing?
<SpadeMagnes[School> Really people...really, something happens and your minds imediatly drift to the worst case scenario?
<EpicMario50> oh no another hacking is comin soon i can feel it
<Cyberlord> hello
<GreatNector> WERE DOOMED
<King> was there any gak ads during todays episode
<SpadeMagnes[School> I feel like Im the only one who trys to not focus on all the fucking negatives
<Kurra> pssh no we're not doomed.
<Dashie_Dashie> Deacon, 4chan called him a pedo for loving applebloom, he cried like a little girl, and the creators felt bad and allowed him to work with them on an future episode.
<GilDash> Serenity: The fandom's at critical mass. That won't be resolved in a nice way.
<Serenity> Inb4 Wrek's just pulling all of your legs
<LadyCanary> GilDash: That's gonna be a lot of blocking really.
<Dashie_Dashie> hence fanpandering.
<Yellowquiet> King yes
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[School we're a bit pessimist :\
<Spy> g*K IS COMINGTO GET US
<fr4nky1> limeV is shit
<GreatNector> STOP TALKING ABOUT IT
<Jazmyn> yah like 7 g** ads
<Sonicrainboom_BOOM> My Little Pony: Friendship is MagicMy Little Pony is a Jewish plot to eradicate the human race by brainwashing males into believing that sexual relations with animals are O.K. The campaign against the sick pony loving fetishists has been an attempt to free mankind from the Jewish mind control program.
<kirbuu> dont mind if its hacked so long as it isnt that creepy turkey again
<Ryunosuke> I appologize to everyone watching PS2 on stream, I logged in and server is comming down in 5 minutes for a quick update
<GilDash> LadyCanary: I didn't mean /ignore them. XD
<Wrek> 05this might work
<Yellowquiet> gak
<GreatNector> make it stop
<Spy> now with more g*k@sonic
<Kurra> I feel sorry for hackers who will never know the sun on their faces, or the epic funs of mountain biking, or surfing or anything outdoors
<Jazmyn> comoooon wreky
<CCCP> Hi r-dash
<vvolfsol0> lol "dats a paddlin

<wipergone2> Sonicrainboom_BOOM: thts bullshit
<r-dash> cccp:hi
<SpadeMagnes[School> I know I cant be blind to the cons, but you guys seem to always focus on the negatives
<GilDash> Kurra: I don't. The deserve what they get. :D
<fr4nky1> why not using twitch.tv?
<Yellowquiet> g k
<Zamer> Wrek you should play Secret of the Magic Crystal
<Yellowquiet> _a
<LadyCanary> GilDash: It doesnt change the fact that they keep showing up anyways
<Metronome> Dashie_Dashie: Is that True Story?
<Deacon> Dashie_Dashie ..wha? let him work on an episode just because of that? I saw that thread, it was just someone saying yes, plus it didn't last that long
<LadyCanary> And Ive been getting massive headaches.
<LadyCanary> BECAUSE of it.
<King> My dick is hard.
<CCCP> Hi GreatNector King and Zacklego Spy and DRHUnleashed
<GreatNector> in 6days are we gonna watch MLP movies
<thelonepony> ...
<Deacon> it was only three post in it
<GilDash> LadyCanary: Eh, give it time. They've got to give up eventually, right?
<Serenity> est
<r-dash> what does this have to do with ponys
<thelonepony> okay, never say that
<GreatNector> hello CCCP
<DRHUnleashed> hi CCCP

<King> me toot
<vvolfsol0> I wonder if they will make an MLP movie to be released in theatres?
<AJIsAwesome> r-dash: Read the FAQ, plese.
<SpadeMagnes[School> I am adopting a wait and see attitude on this
<DRHUnleashed> ded
<Cyberlord> yep
<gunny> Wrek, it looks good on my end, now.
<LadyCanary> I think so.
<fr4nky1> yeah now it keeps playing
<Serenity> CCCP: Bastard bloody chat, derping for the 3rd time in the same hour
<SpadeMagnes[School> I wont judge it till I have more info so...
<CCCP> Hai VenHur
<King> yt its bak
<Canadian_Brony> r-dash ponies are awesome, Planetside 2 is awesome, and streaming ponies 24/7 is boring to the point of sanity. Besides, that's what YouTube is for.
<Deacon> but yea, tbh, Mando's being a drama queen
<CCCP> Hi GreatNector
<Jageman> What is going on with the gnaa?
<thelonepony> Canadian_Brony is right :U
<GreatNector> hello everypony
<Deacon> ello GreatNector
<vvolfsol0> I was streaming MLP and Planetside 2 on twitch a few days ago lol

<GreatNector> how is everyone doing?
<Wrek> 05fr4nky1: lol no they hijacked it
<GreatNector> good?
<Serenity> No idea why they tried to pin it on /v/ though
<Wrek> 05not hack it
<GilDash> I don't think LimeV likes me very much.
<CCCP> MFN they wouldn't be here still if you guys weren't reacting
<thelonepony> GilDash: same here
<_Scootaloo_> -sighs- good...
<Jageman> I know what GNAA did, what is the comunity going to do about it?
<fr4nky1> why stop?
<KiwiBahamut> Hello.
<SpadeMagnes[School> Are you people stupid?
<GreatNector> can we the Canterlot Royal Wedding?
<CCCP> Hi r-dash
<GilDash> thelonepony: Ah, good to know I'm not entirely alone.
<thelonepony> GilDash: but we cant use mips atm
<SpadeMagnes[School> They did this shit to GET A REACTION
<GilDash> thelonepony: Yeah, I saw.
<CCCP> Hi Sloverdable
<GreatNector> GTFO :D
<vvolfsol0> who did what...I just joined in
<Ryunosuke> well isnt it up to mips and gnaa?
<GilDash> SpadeMagnes[School: Oh, is that what trolls do? :D
<GreatNector> NO WAY
<Wrek> 05Jageman: why should we do anythign?
<Serenity> Do the mods still use Veemi?
<SpadeMagnes[School> They're gonna keep doing this shit if we keep reacting to it
<Yellowquiet> good night everyone. may your dreams be full with pink ponies and G4K
<AJIsAwesome> Jageman: We'd just be adding fuel to the fire.
<SpadeMagnes[School> Ignore trolls and they get bored and go away
<Ryunosuke> mips if they were smart would do it as it is losing them streamers and viewers
<thelonepony> SpadeMagnes[School: my reaction "u mad because i watch someting u hate?"
<CCCP> Night Yellowquiet
<gunny> That is true SpadeMagnes[School
<Jazmyn> yay yelloquiet
<Jageman> Wrek: I did not say we should, I was just asking.
<Jazmyn> ur name looks like mine
<Ryunosuke> Jageman: we just sit back and grab some popcorn :)
<SpadeMagnes[School> But of course not everyone in the fandom has a fucking brain...so they add fuel to the fire
<Serenity> SpadeMagnes[School: Probably shouldn't waste your fingertips typing out that speech, it's the brony community after all.
<LadyCanary> Ah, Audioslave. ^_^
<GreatNector> this is just like this i saw called Borderlands
<pony_365492> howdy everypony

<MaxTheBrony> Heya guys ! :)
<Serenity> r-dash: No, just a walking orange over some music and a face saying "IT'S HAPPENEING AGAIN"
<GilDash> LadyCanary: Yeah, I know now you said Audioslave. I've got quite a bit of RAtM. ^_^
<AJIsAwesome> pony_365492: Go lie down. You're drunk.

<wipergone2> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ9vWulShds
<Canadian_Brony> Worgeral yes, but it's on YouTube
<Metronome> Oh well then:/
<Kandarihu> Worgeral, yes. The non-hacked encore, too.
<Serenity> prince-dari: Do you still use Veemi? IIrc, that was a decent embed
<SpadeMagnes[School> I keep falling down these stairs
<MASF123> What is this I heard about some stream getting hacked?
<wipergone2> those who missed it
<Canadian_Brony> wipergone2 no links during stream please :)
<wipergone2> sry
<prince-dari> Serenity: I think we'll be testing out all our old and current providers
<Jazmyn> wooooaaahhhh howd u get thatt
<Canadian_Brony> s'aright
<fr4nky1> the bronystate stream got hijacked by GNAA
<MASF123> Who is GNAA?
<Kandarihu> MASF123, a troll group
<DRHUnleashed> Google it
<_Scootaloo_> facility lost?
<Gasoline> What he playing?
<Deacon> the gay niggers association of america MASF123
<MASF123> DRHUnleashed: Your not helping.
<MASF123> Deacon: Lawl.
<DRHUnleashed> :/
<Serenity> MASF123: Let me give you a funny(note, not actually funnt) and breif sum up: MIPS was hijacked and it displayed a dancing orange that was dancing to some black music, then the next was some guy saying "IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN"
<Kandarihu> Gasoline, Planetside 2. The first big-name F2P game my computer can't handle
<Deacon> besides the crude name, they have been lethal
<cachi01> MASF123: its not a joke thats their actual name xD
<MASF123> Gak National Asshole Association
<Tovler> least it wasn't the GNAC, those Canadians can be brutal
<Wrek> 05goan stream some more jack in a minute :D
<Gasoline> Sounds good
<Serenity> Kandarihu: Heh, think of how much El Shitbox would explode
<LadyCanary> YAY Wreky <3
<SpadeMagnes[School> Well seeing as they only hack to be trolls, it isnt that lethal
<pony_648161> hi
<Metronome> lololloolololl
<cachi01> but knowing them this attack could've been worse
<ekips> Does anyone know where I can get a Planetside 2 Prepay Gamecard in Germany?
<SpadeMagnes[School> Serenity: EL shitbox?
<pony_648161> i wanna cum inside rainbow dash :l
<J_E_Smith71> prince-dari, Wrek: Will you release a statement on the front page and to EqD (for their stream list) that you're dealing with the issue and it shouldn't happen next time? I mean the hack did make us lose a lot of viewers. I was in AJ room and there were over 400 viewers but went down to the 100s after the hijack
<MASF123> Lol. You get kicked for talking about G.a.k now?
<_Scootaloo_> Is this safe for fillies?
<Serenity> SpadeMagnes[School: My old computer remember? Had the processing power for a world war 2 stone calculator
<Metronome> pony_648161: WTF
<SpadeMagnes[School> Ah...right
<Canadian_Brony> pony_648161 this is not 4chan. Please act appropriately or leave.
<fr4nky1> ekips: why? its f2p
<Kandarihu> Serenity, it's not a matter of that. The game doesn't even recognize my GPU as valid. It instantly crashes.
<SpadeMagnes[School> So how massive are these maps?
<Jageman> It's sad that there is such hatred in this world.

<ekips> fr4nky1 I'd like to get a membership though
<ekips> fr4nky1 Because it's a good game and I want to support it
<Serenity> Kandarihu: What do you have? Mind had a Nvidea geforce 8800 gtx
<SpadeMagnes[School> The trolls are never ususaly the problem, the mane issue are the people who react to it
<_Scootaloo_> thx... 100% filly approved wow..
<MASF123> Brb y'all.
<Kandarihu> Serenity, Radeon 4250
<fr4nky1> i didnt heared of this game until ow
<Serenity> HD or basic?
<LadyCanary> UNF dat bass <3
<Kandarihu> HD
<Alchemist> my processor and memory sucks
<MASF123> Oh but first...that troll group...
<MASF123> GNAA?
<LadyCanary> fr4nky1: I never heard of*
<Metronome> Honestly, Watching back the chat reaction of today, it's kinda funny watching all of us react that way
<Gasoline> Well they didn't do any real harm during the episode (I hope)
<Serenity> That's odd, I'd of thought that PS2 could recognise the 4000 series
<Alchemist> My PC setup is getting kinda old
<Randomnerd> Hallo!
<SpadeMagnes[School> Some times I feel I waste my breath saying the logical thing to do with trolls
<MASF123> What did they have against Bronystate?
<MASF123> GNAA
<alexxm> how are things Randomnerd
<Deacon> MASF123 nothing, you know how people are
<Serenity> MASF123: They hate everyone and everything
<SpadeMagnes[School> Clipping!
<fr4nky1> they are trolls
<cachi01> MASF123: nothing they just do it for their lols
<_Scootaloo_> h-he died!
<Randomnerd> alexxm: Things are well, I hope you're doing well.
<Serenity> That answer your question?
<Alchemist> MASF123: nothing really, apart for bronies existing
<r-dash> hope fully they dont hack again
<AJfan77> ...
<alexxm> i am Randomnerd
<MASF123> I agree with cachi01
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[School, sometimes the right people hear it and don't respond.
<Serenity> I would love to have another hijack, and see what appears this time
<SpadeMagnes[School> So GNAA is a brony hater group?
<Derpy_Hooves> http://ohn1ne.tumblr.com/post/36466170057/ive-made-a-terrible-mistake]
<Serenity> No
<AJfan77> Hi huys
<Alchemist> SpadeMagnes[School: no
<MASF123> ...
<Gasoline> r-dash; They will. They don,t have anything beter to do then ruining other people fun ;)
<DRHUnleashed> they will do it as long as it gives them a chuckle
<Metronome> Any1 Notice the Irony? They bully us on the day which shows a bully episode
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[School nah, they love to screw around
<Serenity> They're a "glorified" group of hackers
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[School, I kept hearing calls for everypony to remain calm and that the problem was going to be resolved shortly. I think this was the right thing to do.
<_Scootaloo_> :O
<MASF123> How did Bronystate handle it? Did the stream shut down?
<Gasoline> nope
<Serenity> MASF123: They switched embeds
<MASF123> oh.
<Alchemist> MASF123: stream stopped for about 2 minutes
<Wrek> 05it was that easy
<Deacon> MASF123 I think a backup stream was used
<SpadeMagnes[School> I dealt with trolls many times, I learned to deal with them
<Gasoline> It got back in seconds
<alexxm> MASF123 we just switched embeds
<MASF123> ok
<sonicdude558> on that subject, does anyone know the youtube link for http://imgur.com/sKnw1 ?
<_Scootaloo_> T-this is scary!
<Serenity> Then I jacked that, and it was much much quicker that time
<MASF123> Was this during the Bad Apple stream?
<Deacon> it pays to have backups ;)
<SpadeMagnes[School> You just gotta ignore them, when they dont get a spark to their flame, they get put out and they go somewhere else
<Tovler> Oh, I see it. Dr. Hooves was dressed like a pear.
<Gasoline> That orange was creepy lol
<JRP2234|Zzz> wrek what game w
<Serenity> I found it hilarious
<MaxTheBrony> Its Planetside 2!
<P0N-3> This is why you always have other streaming options.
<AJIsAwesome> Yes, MASF123.
<P0N-3> I just watched somewhere else.
<sonicdude558> I was digging that song
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[School because most people are fickle :\
<vvolfsol0> PS2 is awesome :D
<Serenity> Yeah, IIRC, they have around 8 embeds
<Alchemist> SpadeMagnes[School: that works on a personal level, but not if they troll a group of people.
<MaxTheBrony> If you find this game intresting Go 2 Steam and DL it naow
<Gasoline> It is
<Jageman> I'm going to go, be back later.
<Gasoline> Cya
<MaxTheBrony> Bye Jageman !
<Serenity> PS2 SUC..Oh right, that PS2
<Wrek> 05no P0N-3 thats why you choose one streamign site that knwos how to deal with bullshit ;)
<Gasoline> Haha
<MASF123> AJIsAwesome: Well that was a funny troll then.
<Azuredragon> http://derpibooru.org/161541?scope=scpec5e2f27236f7804360dec876fc5195d9b5e72327

<_Scootaloo_> Isn't this pony awesome??? :D
<RaveBrony> Azuredragon: Oh wow xD
<Gasoline> Do anyone know which other stream they attacked?
<AJfan77> Sonicrainboom_BOOM : Yeah, you do you realise that you took time out of your life to come to this site and write an insult. It just prooves that the people on the internet are even stupider than in 2011.
<texasboykc09> PON-3 me too

<Deacon> vvolfsol0 good call ;)
<J_E_Smith71> P0N-3: Yeah, the next time the hijack happened it was only like 10 seconds and they switched to LimeV
<thelonepony> SpadeMagnes[School: trolls do forget that some of us come from 4chan
<prince-dari> SpadeMagnes[School: All they have accomplished...Is giving us a new video to stream
<prince-dari> <:
<MLP_Brovakiin> :D
<Wrek> 05it is funyn that there is someone that spends more time ruining for bronies than the broneis do enjoyign the show... and then say the bronies have no life.
<thelonepony> :D
<SpadeMagnes[School> prince-dari: ?)
<Serenity> prince-dari: And making a ponies day (mine)
<Gasoline> :D

<Metronome> SpadeMagnes[School: Actually i might know y they did this, Looking back at this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ9vWulShds it's kinda amusing to watch us react that way
<P0N-3> The song was very pop eighties.
<Serenity> My cat is really slumping, she's gonna fall if she#s not careful
<pony_648161> i wanna cum inside rainbow dash !
<Serenity> ^wut
<Metronome> pony_625934243: DUDE WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

<SpadeMagnes[School> Isnt it ironic that people who end up pulling this shit and saying we have no life, spend all time doing this shit?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 http://derpy.me/AZXRt
<CrystalPhoenix> Oh boy shit is about to go down
<vvolfsol0> You havent thoroughly enjoyed MLP till you have watched "Ponies Anthology 2" on Youtube

<_Scootaloo_> it was kinda scary
<otakon17> Hiya LadyCanary
<Phase4> ohai MASF123
<Deacon> MASF123 not really a hack, just a hijack, and probably not unless the GNAA feels like searching for every backup stream
<MASF123> Hi Phase4
<Serenity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I still have those cards somewhere safe
<_Scootaloo_> IM SORRY I WATCHED IT! I KNOW IT IS NSFF BUT I WAS JUST CURIOUS! PLZ DONT BE MAD AT ME :'(
<SpadeMagnes[School> So was it just us? or Mips in entirerly
<Gasoline> Hey Wrek, is there something being streamed after this or is it the end?
<MASF123> _Scootaloo_ why would we be mad.
<Serenity> About 80% of brony sites
<J_E_Smith71> |He said Jack's coming up
<Serenity> Mainly MIPS users
<MASF123> Screw MIPS she is a dirty cheating whore.
<Phase4> 00,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT, if that happens in the next episode it'll be XD
<MASF123> Don't trust her anymore.
<Phase4> 00,02anoying really, asside from the ads i liked mips
<cachi01> wtf is _Scootaloo_ talking about?
<P0N-3> Maybe Trixie is getting a chance to redeem herself?
<Serenity> MASF123: Now now, don't be mad at MIPS
<Phase4> 00,02it autostarted streams so i could suprise you all with loud music
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and then we will hav Card Games in MOTORCYCLES
<Serenity> Phase4: Adblocker :3
<MASF123> I hate MIPS
<_Scootaloo_> :(
<cachi01> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: FAK YEAH
<Phase4> 00,02Serenity, never leave home without it

<DashWithRainbows> What word, Uakh?

<Dashie_Dashie> This house music is pretty neat.
<LadyCanary> Damn it feels good to be a gangsta DashWithRainbows
<Metronome> I risk getting virus, and i find this "Bronies are terrified of the GNAA. This is mainly due to the GNAA's ruining, leading to shut downs, of canterlot.net, and later fimfiction with NCF. That topped onto the endless spamming of ponychat, canternet, and ponychan gave the Autists a good reason to hate all things gay and black. "
<Gasoline> It is pretty nice
<_Scootaloo_> rainbow dash?!?!?!?!
<cachi01> Phase4: you told MASF123 the important thing i told u to tell him right?
<MASF123> Phase4: Plz tell me
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> _Scootaloo_ if you wanted to RP you choose the wrong place, just saying
<P0N-3> I wanna play a pony first person shooter.
<MASF123> cachi01: no he didn't.
<SpadeMagnes[School> Metronome: The hell?

<Serenity> Phase4: We realised

<P0N-3> Forget Jack, I wanna see a movie just for the Scottish guy.
<CCCP> Lol
<Deacon> cachi01 eh, bounty hunters, won't be missed
<Canadian_Brony> Something like this happened to me once. I was in the mall the other day and some girl walks up to me and just rambles on about how her entire week was the latest gossip or somethin'. I just gave her a "Who the fuck are you?" look and she walked away. It was hilarious.
<Nyst> cachi01: nothin' but robots and bounty hunters on that ship.
<Dashie_Dashie> The Scott was the original Demoman
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: Well, this is from years back. It's not that bad, IMO.

<MASF123> Dude like....yeah. And stuff.
<Canadian_Brony> Nyst I didn't get the chance. She was there and gone in 10 seconds flat.
<Alchemist> I remember now. This is a 2 parter episode and Tara Strong has a minor role in the second part.
<Canadian_Brony> No pun intended.
<NuclerReaver> THey speak in Derpy's cutie mark?
<Kipkat07_USAF> there isnt an angry way to say bubbles

<cachi01> Kipkat07_USAF: yes there is
<Tovler> dat upward inflection in his voice?
<cachi01> like this
<Kandarihu> Gee. This guy who The Scotsman thinks is Jack has knowledge that Jack has no way of possessing.
<cachi01> BUUUUBBLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!!! :[

<SamuraiCanary> GreatNector: That makes no sense. And thats not why.
<P0N-3> It sounds like the fishmen are being sick and it's making me feel sick.
<MASF123> Everyone wants a peice of Jack.
<NuclerReaver> This won't end well.
<GreatNector> why
<Derpy> BUBBLES, BUBBLES EVERYWHERE
<Derpy> Pop ALL the bubbles
<Derpy> :3
<Kipkat07_USAF> just keep swimming
