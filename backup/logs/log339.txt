*LadyCanary giggles
<Arentius> reminds me of ork logic in a dark heresy campaign I played..."as long as the greenskin believes it works it does" ...i may have had a gun that had infinite ammo and never needed rerolling because he believed it would work :3
<Arentius> da red onez go fasta
<Randomnerd> Why would they let you play an ork?
<Randomnerd> The game is about the Inquisition.
<Midnight_Tempest> thats how the orks work period Arentius... its Pinkie Pie logic :D
<MahBoi777> best logic
<Arentius> me and my friends like being evil, we just used the dark heresy system
<Saturn> 08,01Arentius: dari heresy! \o/
<Saturn> 08,01*dark
<Saturn> 08,01oh god, i think i pinged him...

<Randomnerd> Or is it "Cunnin', but brutal"?
<MahBoi777> Lagmobile: better than MW2?
<Lagmobile> Why is it everywhere o.o?
<Lagmobile> Its pretty much the same
<Saturn> 08,01oh, speaking of games, did you hear that blizzard are putting in Tauren rogues for MoP?
<Midnight_Tempest> Gork is cunning but brutal, while Mork is brutal but cunning!
<Arentius> tbf, if i had the money I'd make a brettonian army, as its a known fact mounts do more damage than the riders
<MahBoi777> Lagmobile: awwww
<Arentius> ...please tell me thats a joke Saturn
<Lagmobile> Just all the weapons are so nerfed that its balanced
<kirzstryfe> 1,3cows are not sneaky

<Arentius> Doubt it midnight, its just as good as wow and appeals to the scifi fans
<EmeraldChocolate> Oh Midnight, it's beautiful here.. sadly, we had an oil spillage on our beautiful ocean.
<IngloriousPony89> With the money EA has in TOr it's gonna be a looooong time
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, I have problems streaming sound.
<Placebo> Orly?
<Midnight_Tempest> did you turn on the volume?
<Arentius> Tor is doing very well for itself atm

<MahBoi777> Dashie_Dashie: u mean the day after tommorrow?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Of course, EA will compensate by siphoning more money from consumers.
<Midnight_Tempest> ^
<Dashie_Dashie> it's friday for me.
<IngloriousPony89> I find it reeeeallly hard to believe. $500 million is way to much for EA
<EmeraldChocolate> Same here Dashie,
<MahBoi777> OH
<kirzstryfe> 1,3and then it turns out the episode is all about Twilight and Rainbow Dash is only a subtext :3
<CK63|Grading> Rift's cheaper than TOR or WoW, though, which allows it to survive.
<Placebo> kirzstryfe: I'd lol.
<Midnight_Tempest> ^
<IngloriousPony89> NO kirz! NO!
<IngloriousPony89> It must be all RD!
<Dashie_Dashie> kirzstryfe, hasbro best be trolling.

<bluestrom_S> did hasbro say something about derpy?
<Phase4> inb4 derpy demonstrates a high level of compentcy in something, she actualy seems like that kind of character
<Saturn> 08,01bluestrom_S: they asked welovefine to remove derpy stuff

<herostar> who is playing what and put it on livestream? :|
<emantrollslayer> Nittany_Discord: something stupid...
<bluestrom_S> why did they do that Saturn
*SuperBrony64 hugs everypony back
<Hazard3> #bronystate
<Hazard3> >.>
<Phase4> SuperBrony64: a little while back, aparently its not in my chat anymore
<Hazard3> superbrony i pasted that pic on accident
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Okay, but that's your last warning Hazard3
<Hazard3> then ill be banned?
<Ingwaz> derpy may potentially be having her name forcibly changed due to some people misunderstanding "derp" to mean a slang against mentally handicapped people rather than someone who messes things up, is silly and/or accident prone
<emantrollslayer> SuperBrony64: tell me a story pwease?
<KetaminaDianePie> omg......
<Ingwaz> products on welovefine have had their names changed from derpy and the itunes ep for the last roundup has been removed
<herostar> well wats the new name?
<Hazard3> ill tell u a story
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Well, if you post another gore image after you were warned before for posting it, then yes, it's a ban.
<DeadlyDerp3> I doubt it will be changed :p It's kinda canon now
<Yahooz> SILLY FILLIES
<KetaminaDianePie> what are you guys are talking about?
<MirrorImage> herostar - it'll probably be Ditzy Doo
<Yahooz> TIS I
<Hazard3> >.>
*SuperBrony64 hugs Hazard3
<Shizuka> 13thought ditzy was her canonical name and production staff just switched to derpy internally, prior to last roundup anyway
<Nittany_Discord> I don't want it changed even though I prefer Ditzy Doo.
*Placebo Group hug
*Saturn 08,01puts Hazard3 onna head
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I know it was an accident though, so I understand.
<Ingwaz> no shizuka, she never had a canon name until the last round up
<herostar> and that's bad? sounds cute, bu i do agree. his poition has been signed in full :)
<Hazard3> my favorite drug is helium
<Nittany_Discord> Haven't them change it is bowing down to pressure, which is a slightly slippery slope.
<herostar> potition*
<Shizuka> 13not even the mention in... winter wrap up was it?
<Hazard3> i love muffins
<Saturn> 08,01Hazard3: there's another channel where it's okay to post that, but i'm not allowed to advertise it
<Ingwaz> its not necessarily that the name "ditzy" is bad, its that only a small amount are complaining which is leading to this possible change
<Dashie_Dashie> interesting.. but I'll raise you a fluttergiant.
<Dashie_Dashie> http://i.imgur.com/TvktE.gif
<Ingwaz> the large majority of bronies want it to stay
<DeadlyDerp3> Winter Wrap up didn't actually present her name; more likely it was just some random other pony :p
<herostar> sorry my lapop has a bad keyboard. if i mispell anyhing it's the keyboard.
<KetaminaDianePie> :3
*Placebo Drops book on group, somehow picks it up immediately to same page. Aww yeah.
<Hazard3> hate the taste of most but still forcibly eat them because of how derpy likes them too
<herostar> and t is the wors -_-
<emantrollslayer> Shizuka: can you tell me the story of the barnicle before I go to sleep?
<DeadlyDerp3> Cause Derpy is proof of our existence
<Ingwaz> and Shizuka, no, in winter wrap up ditzy was never shown and referred to at the same time
<RAWRity> Shizuka: well, we never actually SAW who "Ditzy Doo" is. Just a mention of a pegasus who went north instead of south.
<herostar> fff-
<DeadlyDerp3> Even when were gone, We still have....DERPY
<Nittany_Discord> I thought parents were e-mail Hasbro demanding an apology for Derpy's character.
<Phase4> ohai herostar
<Shizuka> 13but everyone assumed that meant derpy, and we called her derpy anyway
<Ingwaz> its assumable that it was meant to be derpy, but it was not canon
<herostar> hello Phase4
<Nittany_Discord> And I think they said "Deal with it."
<Nittany_Discord> Or someone did.
<Hazard3> we called her derpy because of her eyes
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: the internal team called her ditzy and then switched to derpy because of us
<MahBoi777> hi herostar
<herostar> hey MahBoi777
<Hazard3> it would be actually insulting to call her that
<Saturn> 08,01giant yellow horse
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Shizuka is a silly filly :3
<emantrollslayer> Nittany_Discord: where is your color?
<Shizuka> 13i don't think this will change fanon at all, we'll be incensed for a while over someone whining enough to get a retcon, but then back to derpy as usual
<DeadlyDerp3> ...I need the link to the image board that first came up wth the name :D
<Ingwaz> and people hav emisunderstood and said we're making fun of mentally handicapped people
<Nittany_Discord> Disabled it for lulz.
<DeadlyDerp3> Well, we are...DUH!
<DeadlyDerp3> Disabled people are HIlarious
<Hazard3> i party like SCOOBEH
<KetaminaDianePie> My god are you serios Nittany_Discord? Some parents protested?
<DeadlyDerp3> GAH! The slinkie landed on my dick!
<Ingwaz> shizuka, every time she comes on though, if shes talked to, it wont be derpy anymore, it would always be ditzy or something, or she might never get a speaking part again
<bluestrom_S> should i buy a derpy t-shirt?
<Hazard3> word to my mama im out of my lama!
<Nittany_Discord> I heard that.
<PartyCannon> You know guys, it could also be a legl issue since Hasbro does not own the rights to the name Derpy...
<Shizuka> 13so?
<Saturn> 08,01KetaminaDianePie: i don't think it was parents, i think it was bornies
<Nittany_Discord> Might be a rumor.
<PartyCannon> *legal
<Ingwaz> bluestrom_S: i would say no, they changed the name from derpy to other various names
<Phase4> www.youtube.com/watch?v=sryqaS07WaU best dubstep ever
<bluestrom_S> or is a marketing thing from hasbro or etc..
<Ingwaz> i would not buy one until the issue has been resolved
<Phase4> huh, steve got kicked again
<Hazard3> i agree PartyCannon
<RAWRity> huh, apparently Jay-Z has described himself as "the new Sinatra" "rap's Grateful Dead" and "the black Axl Rose". Huh.
<Phase4> good
<KetaminaDianePie> Phase4 :3
<Hazard3> Phase4 i agree
<Saturn> 08,01well, i've always presumed her name is Ditzy, but Derpy is a nickname
<Hazard3> stupid F:[ing tab
<herostar> im in seneca.. although not a special ed program, and beleive me, there are 12-yr-olds in collegue in my school, and im 15 and ALREADY have a itt tech invite, we do not think derpy is a word for "retarded or mentally challenged"
<Phase4> ^
<Phase4> what Saturn said
<Hazard3> yeah me too Saturn
*Nittany_Discord 13,01hopes Derpy returns.
<Phase4> although i allso agree with Hazard3
<emantrollslayer> Nittany_Discord: Shizuka is going to kill you
<DeadlyDerp3> Compomise: Derpy is her nickname, Ditzy is her real name :P
<Phase4> tab can be silly
<Ingwaz> had they just said "ditzy" most people would have been fine with that as well Saturn, the problem is that a small amount of people have the potential to change what is canonical
<Shizuka> 13what now
<Nittany_Discord> 12,01My color script doesn't allow previews
<DeadlyDerp3> EVerahbody WINS! I just don't know what went WRONG
<Placebo> This chat is depressing ;.;

<DeadlyDerp3> :p :p :P :P
<Saturn> 08,01previews?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There
<Ingwaz> so please sign the petition, spread the word, show some support for derpy
<Shizuka> 13i am confuse
<Ingwaz> http://www.change.org/petitions/hasbro-studiosthe-hub-do-not-change-derpys-name#
<Hazard3> looks like somepony got a visit from the DEPRESSION CLOWN!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, I can type %C to get the color previews
<Shizuka> 13oh.. that he used my color...
<herostar> so now we jus agree to let her name be changed? what happened to that historical moment when she upstaged applejack?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01His colorful pants fall down, but nobody laugs.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*laughs
<herostar> :|
<Hazard3> hahaha Nittany_Discord
<Shizuka> 13eman i am not so quick to dispense high energy particle devastation from orbit
<Hazard3> u seen that?!
<RAWRity> DeadlyDerp3: simple, some people who have their own preconcieved notions about the term "Derpy" took offense and started their personal crusade to try and have their way.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've seen everything FiMFlamFilosophy has put out.

<KetaminaDianePie> hey i signed it :D!
<DeadlyDerp3> It's either we keep the name and no merchandise and possibly no major role, Or change the name :P
<tematric> they could focus on the older bronies with derpy merchandise
<emantrollslayer> I do not forget all the injustice that has ever been commited against me
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: pretty sure that was Sumica who did that.
<Hazard3> DO NOT WANT

<Hazard3> cya emantrollslayer
<Yahooz> night emantrollslayer
<RAWRity> I still contest that if you think "Derpy" is a slur against the mentally disabled, you must conclude that the name "Jackie" is a slam against chronic masturbators.

<DeadlyDerp3> "Hahahah, what a story Mark"
<Saturn> 08,01unforunately for the computing community, he was the sole developer
<RAWRity> Kencolt: essentially some people took offense to the implication that derpy might be mentally challenged, and wrote to hasbro complaining about it, claiming that "Derpy" is a slur against the mentally disabled. This had led to rumors that Hasbro is backpedaling and going to change her name in the show.
<KetaminaDianePie> :O
<DeadlyDerp3> "He was just a chicken, Cheep CHEEP CHEEP Cheeep Cheeyaaooo"
<Placebo> NOt the whole derpy thing again...

<PartyCannon> SuperBusy64 you rock! Woohoo~
<SuperBusy64> 10,02inb4 BLUE TEXT
<SuperBusy64> 10,02For my D&P Moment, I watched the show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, specifically, Episode 9 ‘Bridle Gossip’. The episode starts off with all the ponies in Ponyville hiding in their houses as an unknown pony foreign to the town arrives. The main character, Twilight Sparkle, is told of various beliefs that this new pony is evil and has intentions of cooking ponies to be
<SuperBusy64> 10,2consumed. The pony in question turns out to be a Zebra wearing various kinds of jewelry and has an accent that resembles someone from Africa. Even though the show doesn’t say it, it’s quite obvious that they are depicting the Zebra, named Zecora, as an African lady. While the entire episode was to teach the lesson of discriminating against someone else based off of popular belief and
<SuperBusy64> 10,2profiling, it’s interesting the character they chose to depict. It was obvious they were trying to keep people from discriminating against people using an African character.

<KetaminaDianePie> daaaaawwwww
<Saturn> 08,01whcih i decided not to take offence at
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, the incident that springs to mind was just before i left there
<Saturn> 08,01as my thing there was generally phone unlocking, i'd taught myself much about phone security
<Placebo> And thus, Saturn invented sexting
<AJTheMightyGamer> oh sap! wario land!
<Placebo> 64: 7 minutes. No pressure.
<Saturn> 08,01but there was one resource i was reliant on in order to get some of the flash files and software i needed

<CupcakeWarrior> Sh*t's getting real now
<Saturn> 08,01long story short, just because they can reinstall windows, doesn't mean they keep their websites patched

<Midnight_Tempest> :D
<Placebo> Please tell me this story ends with Geoff going to work for RvB.
<Midnight_Tempest> brilliant
<KetaminaDianePie> :D
<Phase4> xD
<Saturn> 08,01what ensued was a short, but successful defacement campaign
<KetaminaDianePie> owwww you
<Saturn> 08,01also, remember the phone guys who i mentioned earlier?
<Placebo> Yeah?
<Saturn> 08,01we were paying a subscription to them for using their ftp

<SuperBusy64> 10,02Done! :D
<Placebo> Note to self.. Don't piss off Saturn
<Placebo> SuperBusy64: Hooray~
<SuperBusy64> 10,02Want to read it? :3
<Midnight_Tempest> good work SB... NOW HAND IT IN!
<Placebo> Eeyup.
<KetaminaDianePie> YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY SB!
<Saturn> 08,01so one day, geoff comes in with 8 500GB drives and says "i want all their stuff. everything."
<SuperBusy64> 10,02inb4 BLUE
<Placebo> You need to record it if you have to get up there and speak it
<SuperBusy64> 10,02For my D&P Moment, I watched the show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, specifically, Episode 9 ‘Bridle Gossip’. The episode starts off with all the ponies in Ponyville hiding in their houses as an unknown pony foreign to the town arrives. The main character, Twilight Sparkle, is told of various misconceptions that this new pony is evil and has intentions of cooking ponies to
<KetaminaDianePie> :O
<CupcakeWarrior> OH SHI-
<SuperBusy64> 10,2be consumed. The pony in question turns out to be a Zebra wearing various kinds of jewelry and has an accent that resembles someone from Africa. Even though the show doesn’t say it, it’s quite obvious that they are depicting the Zebra, named Zecora, as an African lady. While the entire episode was to teach the lesson of discriminating against someone else based off of popular belief
<SuperBusy64> 10,2and profiling, it’s interesting the character they chose to depict. It was obvious they were trying to keep people from discriminating against people using an African character. They used many stereotypes of an African culture to depict Zecora especially with some of the African masks used in her hut and the similar language used to that of African tribes. An article I found online helped
<SuperBusy64> 10,2to confirm this stereotyping stating “For centuries, African American women have been contrasted with white women. While the Victorian concept of "true womanhood" defined white women as possessing unquestionable moral character, African American women were defined as immoral and sinful.” In the beginning of the episode, the characters believed Zecora was a sinful pony. I predicted that
<SuperBusy64> 10,2before the episode was over, there was going to be more references to her that she was African possibly including a similar language to African tribes. This turned out to be the case. I believe this issue is of a local concern, as the article provided was stating that this stereotyping was due to perceptions brought up during time of slavery. I also feel it is local as America has the
<SuperBusy64> 10,2history of black people being used as slaves and thus these stereotypes have originated since.
*Placebo DROWNS
<Midnight_Tempest> AHHHHHHHHH!!!1
<KetaminaDianePie> aaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAA

<Midnight_Tempest> call of DOOTY... >_< stupid series
<Placebo> ^ wub.
<Lasharus> Heh.
<Lasharus> I tend to avoid the greyish-brown shooters, overall.
<Lasharus> Give me either something silly or something with a brilliant plot.
<Midnight_Tempest> so Gears of War?
<Placebo> Plus.. it's on the wii.
<Placebo> Halo has pretty colors :3
<Lasharus> (I.e. Serious Sam or BioShock)
<KetaminaDianePie> Lasharus that phrase made you one of my favourite :)
<Midnight_Tempest> bioshock is a good game, but i suggest playing System Shock 2... cause it is so much better
<Lasharus> The 'grim 'n gritty realistic army-style shooter' doesn't even remotely interest me.
<Lasharus> And thank you KetaminaDianePie. :P
<Lasharus> So I'm repeatedly told Midnight_Tempest, but it's a bitch getting a copy :(
<Midnight_Tempest> pirate bay, my friend
<KetaminaDianePie> (the greyish-brown one :))
<SuperBrony64> 10,02i liek poniez :3
<Placebo> I'll wait for Mass Effect, thank you.
<Placebo> 64: no wai!
<Midnight_Tempest> ME3... MUST HAVE!
<Placebo> ^^
<Lasharus> Yeah, a working copy Midnight_Tempest. :P
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Dat blue one with the white coat and the glasses...i liek dat pony :3
<MahBoi777> hmmm, yes ponies indeed!
<Placebo> Rarity?
*Placebo trollface.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:<
*Lasharus slaps Placebo.
<MahBoi777> Vinyl
<Lasharus> Sorry, reflex.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02;____;
<Midnight_Tempest> Lasharus: ive always managed to get working copies of game from pirate bay... thats where i got my version of System Shock 2
<Placebo> :<
*SuperBrony64 hugs Placebo
<Placebo> wub.
<Lasharus> It always seems to happen when people reference those rageface things.
<Placebo> You are a pirate~
<Lasharus> I can't really control it.
<Placebo> Yar Har fiddle dee de.
<Lasharus> Fair enough Midnight_Tempest, but I never got it working :P
<MahBoi777> >.>
<CupcakeWarrior> Pirate Bay is an awesome site
<Placebo> Lasharus: Okayface.
<Lasharus> I'm waiting for Gog.com to pick it up.
<Midnight_Tempest> Do what you want cause a Pony is free, you are a p-o-ny!
<KetaminaDianePie> Pirate Bay........
*Lasharus restrains himself with difficulty.
<Placebo> "fight harder"
<Placebo> Winning 1350 to 550.
<KetaminaDianePie> My country blocked Pirate Bay a year ago :((((((((((((((((((((
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Did something happen to Derpy today? :S
<Midnight_Tempest> i would have thought Gog.com would have it by now
<Placebo> /CoD logic
<Lasharus> Hardly surprising.
<Placebo> SuperBrony64: We had a huge fight over whether or not derpy is an offensive name.
<Saturn> 08,01the guys who ran pirate bay didn't get their sentences reduced :(
<SuperBrony64> 10,02It's not an offensive name ;___;
<MahBoi777> I blame RAWRity
<Lasharus> Nah Midnight_Tempest. GoG.com is sort of stuck with the companies they work with, and they do have to jump through hoops to get some things running.
<Lasharus> Oh dear, the "Derpy = offensive" debate?
<Placebo> Rawrity argued with himself for like, 30 minutes on it.
<Placebo> >.>
<derpy_pony> calling derpy offensive is an insult
<Midnight_Tempest> lol
<Lasharus> I'm in the middle, myself. I can understand some may find it mildly offensive. On the other hand, I'm strongly offended by pulling it off the air.
<TopHat> :( I need the huggz
<Lasharus> To repeat myself, and pardon me for swearing in advance:
<Funkballs> yeah what's going on with derpy? welovefine doesn't call her derpy anyore and the episode is off itunes?
<Lasharus> I fucking HATE political correctness!
<Lasharus> With a blinding passion.
<Placebo> Lasharus: Bucking*
<metalpinkiepiechan> tophat: does someone need a hug?
<Funkballs> is that all we know? Has anyone actually said it's because it's offensive?
<TopHat> yes please
<Lasharus> Apparently so Funkballs.
<Placebo> I move that we set aside the Derpy debate
<metalpinkiepiechan> TopHat: *hugs* hugs bring happiness :333
<Lasharus> It's so immensely tiresome.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I don't want them to rename Derpy... ;___;
<Placebo> in favor of group hug with TopHat
<TopHat> :)
<Lasharus> You literally can't do a bloody thing without SOME interest group going up in arms.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02i need a hug too ;___;
<MahBoi777> Funkballs....that's a hilarious name, just saiyan
*Lasharus tacklehugs SuperBrony64.
<Placebo> SuperBrony64: I brought you a puddin cup
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:D
<Funkballs> hugz all round
*KetaminaDianePie hugs SB64
*SuperBrony64 noms on puddin cup :3

<Lasharus> I'm not going to bother signing a petition for it Midnight_Tempest.
<Placebo> >.>
<Midnight_Tempest> DOOO EEETTT
<metalpinkiepiechan> *faints*
<MahBoi777> O__________o
<derpy_pony> yeah...let's start a petition on reddit
<Funkballs> ಠ_ಠ
<Lasharus> The only reason i'm opposed to them changing it is because they're doing it in the name of PC.
<Placebo> I liek derpy ;.;
<metalpinkiepiechan> same here ;w;
<KetaminaDianePie> PC?
<Lasharus> Eh, as far as I'm concerned, the name "Ditzy" and "Derpy" are interchangeable.
<Midnight_Tempest> derpy is fine the way she is... leave her alone ;A;
<Lasharus> Political Correctness KetaminaDianePie.
<KetaminaDianePie> oooooooo
<Placebo> She made it painfully clear that Ponyvilles contruction is not up to standards.
<KetaminaDianePie> PC suks asss...... as always
<Placebo> > mac
<CupcakeWarrior> Goodnight guys
<Placebo> c w i d t?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02If they rename Derpy to Ditzy I'm going to stop watching the show.
<Placebo> Night cucap
<KetaminaDianePie> HA!
<MahBoi777> ಠ_ರೃ
<Placebo> he's gone. lol
<metalpinkiepiechan> nightcupcake
<Placebo> Oh noes..
<Lasharus> SuperBrony64 - I call bullshit. :P
<Placebo> SuperBrony64: I have to stick around untill at least Feb 11th..
<KetaminaDianePie> owwwww SB :(
<metalpinkiepiechan> same here
<Placebo> I must know.
<derpy_pony> leave derpy alone
<Placebo> ^ lol
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh fine I'll join the argument
<KetaminaDianePie> here we go again...............
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm firm on that stance, I will not continue to watch the show if they rename her to Ditzy.
<Placebo> ;.;
<CupcakeWarrior> I honestly don't care what they do
<Placebo> What will your name change to?
<KetaminaDianePie> hmmmmm......
<CupcakeWarrior> They probably wont even mention derpy again in the show anyway
<KetaminaDianePie> do you know pokemon?
<Placebo> I think it'd be best if they just didn't give her more dialogue. She had her moment, let it remain glorious in our memories.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02My middle name!
<KetaminaDianePie> they did the same thing.........
<Placebo> SuperDanger64?
<SuperDanger64> 10,02Butter
<MahBoi777> toast
<KetaminaDianePie> many times trough the years........
<Placebo> /b/utter?
<SuperDanger64> 10,02I guess I really won't stop watching the show...
<KetaminaDianePie> but i still love them
<Lasharus> To be honest SuperDanger64 - I don't think it's worth getting into a huff over. That's what STARTED this idiocy.
<MahBoi777> SuperButter64?
<Placebo> SB is now SB.
<Placebo> it's canon.
<Lasharus> People are, by and large, idiots. Know that you're above that level, and try to move on.
<SuperDanger64> 10,02But I don't want them to call her anything but Derpy.
<Lasharus> Don't force yourself to stop doing something you enjoy because of something so relatively insignificant.
<Lasharus> And half the fanon out there calls her Ditzy.
<CupcakeWarrior> They will keep calling her that in fanfics at least...
<Lasharus> It hardly matters.
<KetaminaDianePie> well stilll call her Derpy......
<Midnight_Tempest> they originally called her ditzy though... in the winter wrap up episode
<Placebo> just look at Equestria: Total war.
<KetaminaDianePie> as we still think about jinx as black
<MahBoi777> Derpy Ditzy Ditzy Derpy Dotzy Dingy whoopty doo
<Placebo> ALL her names are fanon in it.
<Placebo> lol.
<KetaminaDianePie> and not purple
<TopHat> mfw I've been reading dramatic readings of clopfics for 2 hours
<Rain> what are we talking about derpy for?
<Placebo> SB brought it up.
<Midnight_Tempest> because we can, i guess
<Placebo> >.>
*Placebo noms last puddin' cup
*Midnight_Tempest noms on Placebo
<metalpinkiepiechan> O__O
<Placebo> ...
<Placebo> I'm okay with this.
*Placebo waits for reaction
<MahBoi777> *sips tea*
<Midnight_Tempest> tastes like pudding
<KetaminaDianePie> AND WELL STILL LOVE PORYGON!
<KetaminaDianePie> EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ERASED FROM THE SHOW!
<Lasharus> Now I come to think of it, in my fanfic I went with Ditzy, if memory serves.
<Placebo> dat livestream
<KetaminaDianePie> ow
<KetaminaDianePie> Hey there stream :D!
<Lasharus> Oh, hello me.
<Placebo> Can't even read dat blue text.
<Midnight_Tempest> several fanfic ive read have her as Ditzy... im fine with both but i really do like Derpy more
<HerderBezem> hi mom!
<Lasharus> It's a bit how I think of matters when it comes to Dr. Robotnik Midnight_Tempest.
<Lasharus> Some people still prefer Robotnik, many others go with Dr. Eggman.
<Midnight_Tempest> thats RoBUTTnik Lasharus
<KetaminaDianePie> i cant read the blue text
<Placebo> Wut
<Lasharus> I prefer Robotnik, but I'll accept that the names are interchangeable.
*Lasharus smacks Midnight_Tempest upside the head.
<Placebo> I heard speach.
<Lasharus> Some names are NOT acceptable, however.
<Midnight_Tempest> gah!
<Lasharus> You forget you address the Robotnik-fanboy of BronyState.
<Midnight_Tempest> it will always be RoBUTTnik to me!!! T__T
*Lasharus smacks Midnight_Tempest upside the head.
*Placebo joins in the smacking

*Placebo Swings Lasharus arms for him
<Midnight_Tempest> RoBUTTnik
*Lasharus smacks Midnight_Tempest upside the head.

<Placebo> That's DR. Robuttnik.
<KetaminaDianePie> HEY SB!
*Lasharus deploys the EggHeadSmacker, which promptly proceeds to keep smacking MahBoi777 and Midnight_Tempest upside their heads.
<KetaminaDianePie> Robotnick......
<Placebo> Lasharus: Genius.
<KetaminaDianePie> as the game manuals said
<MahBoi777> ow! what'd I do?
<Lasharus> Okay, KetaminaDianePie?

<MahBoi777> Tophat: I need me some tacos!
<TopHat> That is beautiful
<SuperBrony64> 10,02For my D&P Moment, I watched the show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, specifically, Episode 9 ‘Bridle Gossip’. The episode starts off with all the ponies in Ponyville hiding in their houses as an unknown pony foreign to the town arrives. The main character, Twilight Sparkle, is told of various misconceptions that this new pony is evil and has intentions of cooking ponies to
<SuperBrony64> 10,2be consumed. The pony in question turns out to be a Zebra wearing various kinds of jewelry and has an accent that resembles someone from Africa. Even though the show doesn’t say it, it’s quite obvious that they are depicting the Zebra, named Zecora, as an African lady. While the entire episode was to teach the lesson of discriminating against someone else based off of popular belief
<SuperBrony64> 10,2and profiling, it’s interesting the character they chose to depict. It was obvious they were trying to keep people from discriminating against people using an African character. They used many stereotypes of an African culture to depict Zecora especially with some of the African masks used in her hut and the similar language used to that of African tribes. An article I found online helped
<SuperBrony64> 10,2to confirm this stereotyping stating “For centuries, African American women have been contrasted with white women. While the Victorian concept of "true womanhood" defined white women as possessing unquestionable moral character, African American women were defined as immoral and sinful.” In the beginning of the episode, the characters believed Zecora was a sinful pony. I predicted that
<SuperBrony64> 10,2before the episode was over, there was going to be more references to her that she was African possibly including a similar language to African tribes. This turned out to be the case. I believe this issue is of a local concern, as the article provided was stating that this stereotyping was due to perceptions brought up during time of slavery. I also feel it is local as America has the
<SuperBrony64> 10,2history of black people being used as slaves and thus these stereotypes have originated since.
<TOY_PON3> :O
<Phase4> TopHat: ikr

<TOY_PON3> Derpy will still live on
<Sumica> 00,10reminds me of topgun
<TOY_PON3> ^
<Ingwaz|laptop> let us just hope that hasbro hears our voices once again
<Phase4> huh, never noticed that
<Dken2021> we as a fanbase should handle the derpy thing in a mature way, at least come with some agreement.
<MahBoi777> metalpinkiepiechan: well at least she got to speak
<metalpinkiepiechan> MahBoi777: yeah, thats true
<MahBoi777> and was called Derpy
<Phase4> Dken2021: i recon the ditzy is name and derpy is nickname works
<TOY_PON3> I demand Hasbro get their shit straight and keep Derpy as is
<Sumica> 00,10lyra heartstrings comes to mind
<Phase4> ^
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON3: agreed
<Dken2021> cause if we don't we might end up like the sonic fans, all distraught over little details

<Sumica> 00,10fire bad?
<Saturn> 08,01you know when you're browsing the web, and you go to an SSL encrypted site
<Dken2021> yeah?
<TopHat> well that didn't work
<Saturn> 08,01sometimes the browser will pop up a message saying the certificate isn't valid, or that there's no certificate, for whatever reason
<TOY_PON3> dat Hatsune Miku
<Jim> ohai everypony
<KetaminaDianePie> i kinda have 3 different versions of this.....
<Saturn> 08,01if it does that, and you're paranoid, treat the connection as unencrypted
<TOY_PON3> hey Jim
<KetaminaDianePie> but not this one :D!
<Simon2> apple!
<Jim> may I ask what is on the stream? o_O
<dashiee> hi jin
<dashiee> jim
<Phase4> wait

<SuperBrony64> 10,02lol Saturn
<Rain> dat bad apple
<Phase4> bad apple?
<KetaminaDianePie> an orchestrated NicoNicoDouga medley :D!
<Saturn> 08,01i just sniffed my brother's paypal password from a supposed "secure" connection using a wifi man in the middle attack, combined with an SSL MITM with a fake certificate
<Dken2021> is this the current medley they're using now?
<TOY_PON3> it seems KetaminaDianePie is enjoying this at the moment, good for him
<KetaminaDianePie> :DDDDDDDD
<TopHat> sniffed?
<Phase4> Saturn: i;ve never been to a site were i cared wether or not it was encrypted with an out of date certificate or wrong domain or so on so forth
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Your brother has lost all privaleges on the internet, go take away his internet card.
<Phase4> Saturn: neat, how'd you do that
<Sumica> 00,10dem mitm attacks
<Sumica> 00,10no this was the first medley
*TOY_PON3 continues on homework
<Sumica> 00,10Douga
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: i poisoned the ARP cache of the networks (which technically i didn't *have* to do, since I have access to the router), redirected traffic to myself, set up my own natting using iptables, and filtered his traffic through sslsniff using a fake certificate i generated
<KetaminaDianePie> awwwwww listen....... at the reprise........
<TopHat> Sleep? Lawl. FAAAAR too mainstream
<Saturn> 08,01*network
<Phase4> Saturn: its the certificate i'm interested in, firefox and chrome go nuts on invalid sigs
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: yeah, it probably popped up an error, and he clicked through it
<Phase4> xD
<Saturn> 08,01most people ignore these things
<Phase4> that works i supose
<Saturn> 08,01so yeah, don't
<Saturn> 08,01also, never let me on your wifi network :P
<Sumica> 00,10never ingnore the warnings
<Phase4> Saturn: noted
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: aye, if it's somethign important
<Sumica> 00,10hehe you would have fun at my work Saturn
<Sumica> 00,10so many unsecured wifi's and bluetooth devices
<Saturn> 08,01lawl
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Can I have a job at your business Sumica? D:
<Phase4> i arp poisoned a computer at tafe once, so easy
<TOY_PON3> umm was that one guy humping the air?
<Phase4> i think the command is actualy called arppoision
<KetaminaDianePie> ha
<Sumica> 00,10I mic spam the meetingservice guys with pony music and my iphone
<Saturn> 08,01the only network i know that actually signs their encryption (thus preventing an ARP poison like i did) is my uni network
<Phase4> nope. arpspoof
<Jim> awesome Sumica ^^
<Saturn> 08,01and not the normal uni network, only the CS network
<Sumica> 00,10cause they dont secure the radios
<Rain> lol
<TOY_PON3> Sumica: That's a win
<Phase4> at tafe they used norton ghost to distribute images
<Sumica> 00,10and well the cctv's and projecters have pony clips at least once a week
<Saturn> 08,01basically, you shout out to the network "yeah man, i'm the router, honest, send me all your traffic"
<Phase4> ^
<KetaminaDianePie> :O
<Rain> sadly I think they are trying to get Sumica back for the pony stuff
<Rain> he keeps getting hurt at work :'(
<Phase4> anyway, they use norton ghost over a samba/cifs/whatever its called share
<Phase4> directory was writeable
*TOY_PON3 puts on intelligent glasses on and continues work
<TopHat> hotsauce
<TOY_PON3> damn said on twice...
<Phase4> never actualy did anything with it, files we're individualy wirte protected, but depening on how norton works (started looking into it and got bored) i might have been able to inject things into the image
<TOY_PON3> intelligent glasses don't work!
<Simon2> is this... smilian?
<Sumica> 00,10wonder how many reconise the songs
<Phase4> lol
<Dken2021> dat gradius
<Phase4> ^^vv<><>ba
<Saturn> 08,01i'm currently trying to make an attack where i spoof firefox into accepting a spurious update
<Saturn> 08,01but i'm not sure if that's possible
<Simon2> lol pacman
<KetaminaDianePie> this one yes!
<Phase4> i assume the're signed somehow
<Jim> That was one awesome video
<Saturn> 08,01but the goal there is to update firefox with bogus certificates
<Saturn> 08,01again, using MITM
*TOY_PON3 puts on intelligent hat and works
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Newsletter is going out! :D

<MakerDusk> curious
<Phase4> i'l remember to screenshot it next time

<MakerDusk> Sumica: there are ways to crash those by sending certain things too...

<ScootaChicken> >If it's a story
<ScootaChicken> >My Little Dashie
<ScootaChicken> my assumption is correct, isn't it.
<Kammerjunk> Yes.
<Kammerjunk> Yes, it is.
<Kammerjunk> Amongst others.
<Kammerjunk> Not the-fic-that-shall-not-be-named, though
<Kammerjunk> That was just silly.
<ScootaChicken> that didn't make me cry
<Kammerjunk> It was pure shock material, and well, I found this fandom via /b/.
<ScootaChicken> meh...
<ScootaChicken> I've never really gone on 4chan

<Kammerjunk> At the last meetup I went to and the very first in Denmark, we couldn't go to Toys'r'Us, the closest being a few miles away and all.

<NewDCD> 09,01that's why I decided to stream it
<Yellowquiet> Hi
<Yellowquiet> whats that
<derpy_pony> It's probably not the same if you haven't played zelda games
<Jim> hi Yellowquiet
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello Yellowquiet
<Yellowquiet> hey jim
<NewDCD> 09,01not a Zelda spinoff. Even if Pietoro DOES look like Link....but he was created in the 70's so he actually predates Link
<NewDCD> 09,01also
<NewDCD> 09,01>has Dragon Blood
<mooponi> copied from skyrim
<NewDCD> 09,01he was Link AND the Dovahkiin years before it was cool
<derpy_pony> I'll give it a chance
<Kencolt> Um... if he's drawn from a PS1 RPG, then he can't predate Link, who comes from the original NES "Legend of Zelda" game?
*Yellowquiet hugs LunaTheBeloved
*Yellowquiet hugs Jim
<NewDCD> 09,01Popolocrois was first a manga, then an RPG, then an animu, and then another animu

<NewDCD> 09,01yeah, pretty much.
<xcanox> In the palm of his haaaaaaaaaand.
<NewDCD> 09,01DAT ECONOMY

<LunaTheBeloved> MOAR POWAH!!!
<Epona> I like booms.
<Kencolt> This is the kind of thing that never ends well.
<Kammerjunk> I love it when the Moon and the Sun are visible at the same time.
<Kammerjunk> It reminds me of Luna and Celestia.
<Yellowquiet> ^^
<LunaTheBeloved> Fluttershy is crying somewhere...
<NewDCD> 09,01by the way, is the audio okay?
<LunaTheBeloved> Yeah, its fine
<Epona> That kid looks like Link.
<NewDCD> 09,01yeah, he does. But he was created earlier than Link, so he's not a copy
<Kencolt> great. He's invented an orbital laser deforesting system. What's economical about that?
<Epona> The real estate will be through the roof!
<Epona> That's the economical value!
<NewDCD> 09,01ECONOMICAL ROBOT

<Sumica> 00,10want my 95mph winds for a bit?
<Dashie_Dashie> want my sunshine and 45 degrees?
<Wrek> 05want my -34degrees(C) for a week?
<Malix> Frostbrand sounds like an enchantment you would put upon a sword.
<NewDCD> 09,01want my endless summer?
<LunaTheBeloved> I have Sunshine and 600 degree weather :)
<Malix> I would love 034
<Yellowquiet> i love the cold weather
<Malix> -34*
<Cy`> Want my 52 degree weather with 20mph winds?
<LunaTheBeloved> *60
<Inquisitor> Frostbrand I believe IS a magic sword in final fantesy
<Yellowquiet> -10
<LunaTheBeloved> Not 600
<Malix> It's only 0 (32F) here atm
<Kencolt> It shows up in a lot of taletop RPG's also...
<Sumica> 00,10I find once you get below -10 C I cant tell the drffrence
<LunaTheBeloved> Nice cool Fall weather is best imo
<Malix> -10 is where i start feeling it :P
<Kencolt> Tabletop RPGs.
<Inquisitor> 34 F here in chicago, warm enough for fog
<Yellowquiet> - 10 no clouds sun and snow
<Yellowquiet> best weather ever
<Inquisitor> I hate winter
<Malix> sun AND snow? what devilry is this?
<Sumica> 00,10but then again I have goten used to death vally heat so my feeling for cold is a bit dulled
<Dashie_Dashie> Partly cloudy 34F 8mph winds here.
<Yellowquiet> Discord weather^^
<Sumica> 00,10and I complanin at any thing close to freezing
<Wrek> 05for 10 minutes i couldnt feel 3 fingers
<Wrek> 05and 1 knuckle
<Yellowquiet> haha ^^
<Inquisitor> where're ya at Dashiex2?
<Sumica> 00,10what did you leave that hand outside over night or did you like have that hand exposed when outside?
<Dashie_Dashie> New yorkz
<Malix> I just don't get cold easily at all. -34C would be an interesting learning experience. And also mildly hilarious
<Wrek> 05i was having a smoke on the way home
<Sumica> 00,10good god what happend to link and zeldas eyes?
<Yellowquiet> now you know why smoking is unhealthy wrek
<Inquisitor> ah, I'd figure it'd be worse given the east coast, but then again we got lake michigan so it's similar
<Dashie_Dashie> SQUADELA WE ARE OFF!
<Malix> And there we have it; Smoking causes frostbite
<Malix> altenrately, it gives you a cool ive-element sword.
<Malix> ice* 0_o
<Inquisitor> I'm so hungry, I could eat a octorock
<Dashie_Dashie> I can't wait to bomb some dodongos!
<Sumica> 00,10bleh I dont want to go out in to this wind but I need a haircut badly
<Malix> So I got to the water temple in Skyward Sword (yeah im goin kinda slow, shaddap). Immediately turned the wii off, went to a friend's house, stayed the night.....haven't touched the wii since. God do i ahte water temples.
<mooponi> haircut emergency?
<Inquisitor> the water temple in Ocarina is the worst one, although volume wise it's the smallest
<Sumica> 00,10it's more of it's a nuasance to have it down to the middle of your back if you work in a kitchen
<Inquisitor> I'm growing my hair out for Locks of Love
<Malix> well, i hate water levels in general. t'was actually dire dire docks from mario 64 that caused it.
<Dashie_Dashie> my hair is taking forever to grow back
<Malix> i was terrified of that whirlpool.
<Dashie_Dashie> it's bugging me
<Dashie_Dashie> I should have had a carpet on my head last month
<Sumica> 00,10mine grows too fast
<Malix> and my hair is long enough to go through my belt ^_^
<Sumica> 00,10my last hair cut was around july
<Inquisitor> mine's not that long Malix, but close
<Inquisitor> hmmm, thinkin I might go make steak, eggs, and hashbrowns for brunch
<Yellowquiet> poor snake
<Inquisitor> wait, we got robots now?
<Malix> so are these people all gnomes or just kids or what?
<Kencolt> Only this proto Eggman gots da robots.

<Starflash> yeah XD
<otakon> Simon: eeyup
<ofna01> i was simon
<NewDCD> 09,01also
<NewDCD> 09,01for absolutely NO REASON, enter gluefactory
*Globetrotter shakes Lulu s hand whilst wearing a tophat "good show ma'a,
<ofna01> it wouldnt stop sending me messages
<NewDCD> 09,01I think that the reason they're inviting and autokicking
<NewDCD> 09,01is to get hostname information from IRC users
<NewDCD> 09,01so avoid it at all costs
<LunaTheBeloved> Why do you even wanna go some where named Gluefactory?
<ofna01> i dont use IRC ^___^
<Lulu> 07,01^
<mooponi> z-line
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm not using IRC
<Dashie_Dashie> so I winnn
<NewDCD> 09,01GlueFactory is the name of the anti-brony operation established a few days ago
<NewDCD> 09,01so yeah.
<Kencolt> Perhaps it's good I wasn't using an IRC client but a webclient.
<Starflash> I accidentally entered for a sec -_-
<ofna01> same here ken
<Globetrotter> Yup, webclient
<ofna01> can they hurt that too newDCD?
<LunaTheBeloved> I just continually ignored it
<otakon> a few days ago?
<Lulu> any IRCops available?
<otakon> really?
<otakon> WHY?!
<Vivix> Internet is filled with bad people
<ofna01> their just closet brony's i bet
<bicyclerepairman> some spambots around, huh?
<Vivix> Pay no mind to it and contiue doing good
<ofna01> we must love and tolerate them to death!
<otakon> I don't understand the hate
<Lulu> yep
<NewDCD> 09,01haters gonna hate
<Vivix> They probably attack for fun
<otakon> ._.
<ofna01> its pretty much the perfect trap
<Starflash> Hmm... My scanner found a very odd browser cookie after entering gluefactory >;l *delete.*
<VinylScratch> >_>
<Starflash> probably coincidence though.
<bicyclerepairman> yeah, i'm banning around a little as well... seems everyone of the staff is either sleeping, shopping, or simply gone
<ofna01> they try to make us mad so we go in,then they steal our IRC stuff
<mooponi> ah
<MirrorImage> Starflash - what site was the cookie for?
<mooponi> its thunder and storm
<MirrorImage> errr... PM it to me
<Lulu> Whatever you do DO NOT enter gluefactory
<ofna01> maybe i should delete mine too...
<bicyclerepairman> hm, why?
<ofna01> better safe then sorry,right?
<otakon> guys!
<Vivix> yeah
<otakon> run your cleaners!
<ofna01> yeah ota?
<ofna01> why?
<otakon> I think that bot
<Lulu> that's the HQ of their operations
<ofna01> virus?
<otakon> might have given you something
<ofna01> shiit
<Lulu> > GlueFactory is the name of the anti-brony operation established a few days ago
*Jim runs a virus scan
<ofna01> anything specific?
<Starflash> No trojans, ofna01.
<Starflash> That's all I know.
<NewDCD> 09,01nah, I'm more worried they were trying to get information on bronies...that's what was detailed on the Operation Glue Factory document
<Vivix> Their eyes are like piecharts
<Jim> I didn't go into the gluefactory, but better safe than sorry, ey?
<MirrorImage> got a link to this doc DCD?
<NewDCD> 09,01collecting info on bronies and decrypting it....
<NewDCD> 09,01hold on
<ofna01> i've got mac,would it hurt me?
<VinylScratch> what in the name of
<Globetrotter> Vivix creepy piecharts
<bicyclerepairman> aww, so cute
<Vivix> yeahh
<ofna01> otakon
<NewDCD> 09,01http://paste.org.ru/?nyyb10
<Lulu> can I pm you?
<bicyclerepairman> sure
<NewDCD> 09,01that said, hashes take years to decipher, and I'm not exaggerating...years to decypher ONE.
<Funkballs> that depends on what it's a hash of man
<NewDCD> 09,01INCOMING THU'UM IN THREE
<NewDCD> 09,01TWO
<NewDCD> 09,01ONE
<Funkballs> with rainbow tables a lot of those could take minutes...
<Funkballs> or seconds
<Funkballs> if it's a long complex password then yeah years
<NewDCD> 09,01that specific hash would take years, according to the FiMFiction staff
<VinylScratch> ...
<threwthedoor> What is this
<Funkballs> if it's "bestpony" not so long
<NewDCD> 09,01PoPoLoCrois
<threwthedoor> Nice
<threwthedoor> Also
<ofna01> oh god
<Kencolt> Ok. Tuna Pie is a kickass tuna pie.
<Vivix> incane clown posse?..wat
<Dashie_Dashie> Why does every idiotic pony hater think we're furries? *facehoof for stupidity*

<mooponi> whats wrong with furries
<Vivix> I think they might be revising the voice due to gender buut other than that--I havent heard any hate
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello diddutz
<MirrorImage> threwthedoor - there are people that think that the name "Derpy" is insulting to people with mental disabilities
<ofna01> we're on sorta of an alert
<threwthedoor> Oh
<MirrorImage> to which, we respond "no it isn't."
<diddutz> alert? because of what?
<VinylScratch> how pathetic
<LunaTheBeloved> ALERT ALERT-----just kidding
<VinylScratch> plain and simple, pathetic.
<Vivix> if standards of broadcasting didnt stop it itll prolly be fine
<otakon> well
<ofna01> spam bot attack,possible virus sent through here
<otakon> they have different standards nowadays
<ofna01> everyone's advised to run their anti-virus programs and empty their cookies
<otakon> eeyup

<Vivix> Then again Ive lurked fooor houuurs

<Dashie_Dashie> I mean seriously.
<NewDCD> 09,01I think we already watched this episode...let's check.
<Vivix> usually when people steal passwords like this its to use it in your mail or other acces points and try to get your credit etc
<ofna01> your IP,they could shut down your computer permanentley,dashie
<LunaTheBeloved> What is this?
<NewDCD> 09,01GaoGaiGar

<ofna01> here's their desription of us
<bicyclerepairman> eeyup
<ofna01> Bronies" are a group of grown men hailing from the long-furry-infested chans. They would have you believe that they are just people who enjoy watching cartoons with their families. But this, IS A LIE. Bronies are disgusting horse porn drawing faggots. You'll be hard pressed to actually find a brony who actually has "children he watches it with". The bronies like to share their tales of horse molestation on a wide range of website
<Lulu> yep
<NewDCD> 09,01yeah we already watched this one
<derpy_at_work> Let me guess
<LunaTheBeloved> That's not disturbing at all
<LunaTheBeloved> Totally not
<TheMultiCaster> Evenin folks
<Vivix> hehe
<ofna01> read the rest of the article then
<otakon> oh yeah this one
<derpy_at_work> Rainbowderp?

<bicyclerepairman> yep
<otakon> that document
<ofna01> go to bronystate
<Lulu> oh not only him
<Vivix> but yeah, pay them no mind and just continue being careful
<bicyclerepairman> ohai TerraFirma, long time no see
<otakon> um
<otakon> they have peoples info
<Kencolt> Ah. so... they're idiots. That's okay. Idiots are with us always.
<TerraFirma> Hello again.
<ofna01> yeah
<Vivix> yeah, and on the internet idiots DO things
<bicyclerepairman> and then some E7somethingsomething
<otakon> that is what worries me
<NewDCD> 09,01DAT PATRIOTIC LAB COAT
<Dashie_Dashie> IN AMERICA.
<Vivix> dont let it worry you, if you worry its a success for them-
<derpy_at_work> Not what i wanted to see while at work

<derpy_at_work> Terra
*TerraFirma shrugs
<derpy_at_work> As
<Dashie_Dashie> datur?
<Vivix> Datur
<otakon> oh yh
<NewDCD> 09,01I TOOK OFF MY SHADES
<NewDCD> 09,01AND I HAD ANOTHER PAIR UNDERNEATH
<otakon> THAT GUY IS NOT A VILLAIN FOR SURE
<ofna01> lulz
<NewDCD> 09,01THAT'S HOW BOSS I AM
<Jim> gaga
<bicyclerepairman> smaller channels seem to be fine though...
<otakon> I get a kick out of this show
<VinylScratch> son of a whore
<Kencolt> I just realised-- all the Americans actually LOOKED like human beings.
<derpy_at_work> I noticed
<TerraFirma> Guess its another of those "Try to harass the big communities" Things
<Vivix> SOO MANY ROBOTS notallcaps
<pony_4610> they didnt sound like human beings
<Lulu> yea it is
<bicyclerepairman> hm, dunno... two single bots isn't really harassment imo
*LunaTheBeloved is getting a mighty Morphing Power Rangers feeling from this
<otakon> hey NewDCD you have Giant Robo?
<derpy_at_work> Was bronystate thee first who was hit?
<otakon> that would be a good one to stream
<NewDCD> 09,01not yet, but SOON
<Lulu> nope
<otakon> cool
<Lulu> #brony I believe
<VinylScratch> how long ago did all this happen?
<VinylScratch> like the spambots
<Phobeus> EMERGENCY! rainbowderp` (ohyou@61mg6x55.bb.sky.com) spam
<otakon> it's fairly short and it's good
<bicyclerepairman> seems so, i dunno
<bicyclerepairman> yeah
<pony_4610> that mom voice
<Phobeus> invite spam, and channel flooding
<ofna01> inyl
<derpy_at_work> We know
<Phobeus> oh, okay
<bicyclerepairman> channel flooding?
<otakon> VinylScratch: been happening since new years and this group apparently formed just before FimFiction was hacked
<Phobeus> thanks :)
<Phobeus> yeah
<ofna01> less then 10 minutes ago i'd say
<bicyclerepairman> he just pm spammed us
<VinylScratch> oh jesus.
<Phobeus> channel flooding with colourfull non ascii characters
<TerraFirma> he doesn't really channel flood
<ofna01> my computer is acting weird
<TerraFirma> he just posts whenever anyone says anything
<Phobeus> channel flood in #bronies.cz
<Dashie_Dashie> uh oh
<TerraFirma> ah
<ofna01> gonna scan for virus real quick
<LunaTheBeloved> Tank goodness my Commensense was tingling and didn't join that room
<bicyclerepairman> just ban them for now, that stops the pm spam as well
<LunaTheBeloved> *thank
<Phobeus> oh, okay
<bicyclerepairman> all the ircops seem to be out at the moment
<TerraFirma> ignoring him also works
<ofna01> i didnt even join it
<LunaTheBeloved> Still ran a check anyway
<Phobeus> i banned him after first post
<NewDCD> 09,01FUCK YEAH LIGER IS BEST UNCLE
<NewDCD> 09,01AND HE HAS PINKIE PIE MUFFIN HAIR
<VinylScratch> so just being connected to irc is enough for them to do something to people's computers? or would i have had to accept something or join a room? :V
<TerraFirma> if he catches you in the loop just ignore him it'll autostop his invites/pm spam
<otakon> my god is he SHORT
<TerraFirma> then hit him with the B& hammer
<mooponi> VinylScratch: its possible to get a virus just from viewing an image
<otakon> VinylScratch: they had auto joins
<ofna01> you dont even have to be in IRC
<Jim> epilepsi
<TerraFirma> its how I've delt with him in his two bots on #20pc
<otakon> wth
<ofna01> i got a worm from just being in this chat
<NewDCD> 09,01DOSE ATTACK DESCRIPTIONS

<YUUSHA-OH> don't worry bro
<otakon> did he just diss his creator?
<YUUSHA-OH> being Gay for Gai doesn't make you gay

<otakon> still works for 1.3
<MirrorImage> but i swear a patch note said that specific glitch was fixed
<TopHat> wait, why did I wake up?

<TopHat> but I want to see it

<otakon> absorb HEALTH!
<MahBoi777> idk
<otakon> Cypresswolf: it still works on Xbox

<otakon> Wrek: do you ahve the perk that reduces falling damage when your wearing all heavy armor?
<Sumica> 00,10slayer of dragons trips and falls down the steps
<qwerty> fail after fail
<MirrorImage> because you know,e ven at level 40, a 30 foot drop will shatter your legs
<TopHat> didn't look like he fell that far
<MirrorImage> he fell far enough
<MahBoi777> if only Fus Ro Dah cud act as a fall damage reducer
<TopHat> just roll when you land
<Sumica> 00,10the balls for it?
<MirrorImage> MahBoi777 - that might've been nice, if he wasn't still recharging his shout after using one to jump off the edge
<MahBoi777> MirrorImage: lol true
<Sumica> 00,10did you just sugest yelling at the ground to reduce fall damage?
<MahBoi777> I did indeed
<MirrorImage> Sumica - "Move you stupid Earth! I'm falling here!"
<Yellowquiet> you can buy them in the mage guild
<Morty> when u fall it calculates height at the begining of the jump. he traveled on an x plane for a while after the jump, making the fall seem small from where he ended up, but to the game he fell from the top of dragonsreach
<Yellowquiet> the hearts
<MahBoi777> curse you gravity! *shouts*
<TopHat> this reminds me of fable
<MirrorImage> Morty - actually, about half way
<MirrorImage> i believe he was at the first landing
<Sumica> 00,10Gravity wins; Fatailty
<Globetrotter> I'm off for a while everypony, there's pizza!
<Morty> well, you get the idea
<LadyCanary> Bye Globetrotter
<Morty> it was bigger than it looked
<Cypresswolf> what is the best place to find deadra in skyrim? Those....baddies with the sharpened stick weapons have some sometimes but those are hard to find

<otakon> I don't care
<Jim> elves?

<otakon> and stmaina!
<NullRadix> Daedra hearts are easy, just farm the alchemy shops
<otakon> not banish
<otakon> banish is WEAK!
<Morty> and stamina is best for continous power attacks

<otakon> it's worthless
<NullRadix> banish sells well
<Yellowquiet> take fire
<otakon> GODDAMNITDARIbot!
<MirrorImage> Fire always does the most pure damage if that's what you're looking for
<MahBoi777> don't read the book = reads book
<NullRadix> iron dagger + banish + paralyze = like 1000, 2000 something
<otakon> Fire is best overall
<Yellowquiet> FIRE IS COOLER!
<NullRadix> of course giants toe potions are 4k
<Yellowquiet> no
<Yellowquiet> FIRE
<Sumica> 00,10fire>cooler

<RawketLawnchair> It stinks.
<StickySyrup> RAINBOW!!!!!!
<emantrollslayer> He's just like "fillies PLEASE"
<Yellowquiet> Great job emantrollslayer
<emantrollslayer> joshman129: it's all purely speculation...no one is really sure
<Morty> joshman129 Wrek said no
<String_Shredder> u drew a good rainbow dash emantrollslayer
<sammygotbeatz> is there a stony channel that I'm just not seeing?
<RawketLawnchair> joshman129: Some idiot got assmad about Derpy being an 'ableist slur', and bitched at Hasbro to remove Derpy because they were offended.
<emantrollslayer> String_Shredder: O.o......
<MahBoi777> joshman129: ppl think Derpy is an offensive term pointed towards special people
<fluttershyfan158> anyone seen marble hornets
<emantrollslayer> Wrek: good song choice /)
<derpy_pony> joshman...it's the rumor that they want to change derpys name because some moralfag lobby group feels they have to protect the disabled
<sonicrainboomer259> derpys mentally challenged and people are pissed about it,nuff ssaid
<RawketLawnchair> MahBoi777: *A person thinks that. . .
<TopHat> <--- I think I like this guy
<joshman129> I'm just kinda paranoid and it seems to be a big deal... I'm worried that Hasbro is gonna take it seriously
<Wrek> 05the whole thing is stupid and pointless. take it elsewhere.
<Shrimp3000> Derpy is the best non-mane pony.
<Yellowquiet> i lost my sharpener nooooo
<derpy_pony> but..it is only a rumor...i haven'T seen a single proof of all this...just a rumor going viral
<LadyCanary> Wrek has spoken.
