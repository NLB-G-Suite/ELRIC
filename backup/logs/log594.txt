<Jmo4267> Oh prince-dari
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Did you eat it?
<prince-dari> I tried to catch it but it disappeared.
<Jmo4267> One of them finally made it into your home.
<Lunar_Brony> perhaps you 2 can liven up this dead chat for us, hmm?
<Lunar_Brony> seeing as how everypony is in Dashiesauce ATM
<SuperBrony64> 11,02prince-dari: "I can has hug tiem now?"

<Lunar_Brony> dat true
<Jmo4267> He has a point.
<Jmo4267> Australian spiders.
<Jmo4267> CRIKEY.
<prince-dari> The bastard still made me jump though
<Lunar_Brony> I've seen so many house spiders I'm no longer phased
<Lunar_Brony> but Australian . . .
<prince-dari> Well, that's one thing I don't think anyone gets used to
<Lunar_Brony> I would whistle if i could
<prince-dari> Same as when they crawl out of the toielt when you're sitting on it
<prince-dari> toilet*
<Jmo4267> HAHA.
<Jmo4267> Sounds like you've had experience prince-dari.
<prince-dari> You just can't prepare yourself for shit like that.
<Lunar_Brony> I find them in my shower
<Lunar_Brony> and I wear glasses
<Lunar_Brony> all I see a fuzzy black spot in the corner
<Jmo4267> That moment when you lose sight of a spider when you're about to go to sleep.
<Lunar_Brony> if i see it
<Lunar_Brony> mine hang out in the bathroom, although I did get ants in my bedroom for over a month
<Lunar_Brony> I swear, I killed over 100 of the damn things
<Lunar_Brony> used up half a bottle of bleach
<HoodyNinja> I live with spiders
<Lunar_Brony> I live with a 6 year old sister
<HoodyNinja> 9
<prince-dari> You know, I don't think you'd care that much if a spider landed on your head, but when they drop from the ceiling and you see them right in front of your face I swear it makes you jump more.
<Jmo4267> You're just a wuss prince-dari. ;D
<Lunar_Brony> I just scanned my ceiling
<prince-dari> Pfft, it would make anyone jump. :P
<prince-dari> Built in response
<Jmo4267> prince pls.
<Lunar_Brony> my bed is elevated, too

<Lunar_Brony> I woke up with an angry mother in my doorway
<Lunar_Brony> I got 2 hours of sleep
<HoodyNinja> Lunar_Brony: Anger level?
<Jmo4267> Here it comes.
<Jmo4267> Ah.
<Lunar_Brony> enough for a normally calm and focused woman to swear at her own son so he would get his lazy ass out of bed and clean his room, bathroom, and spare bedroom
<Jmo4267> Damn derp chat.
<Lunar_Brony> in other words, extremely
<HoodyNinja> My mom would slap me out of bed :p

<JRP2234_> MakerDusk is very dusk
<Lunar_Brony> is MakerDusk even active?
<XAXpod> JRP2234_: Right.
<MakerDusk> blarg
<Lunar_Brony> Yes.
<XAXpod> ^ there's your answer
<Lunar_Brony> Yes he is.
<MakerDusk> why do you guys always trigger my alerts as I trying to go to bed?!!
<JRP2234_> MakerDusk: whats a dusk
<Jmo4267> Cause they're evil.
<JRP2234_> and are you the maker
<Lunar_Brony> I blame JRP2234_
<Jmo4267> ^
<MakerDusk> lol
<MakerDusk> >_>
<MakerDusk> <_<
*MakerDusk contemplates doing some evil...
<Lunar_Brony> chat is very quiet tonight because everypony is in Dashiesauce
<Lunar_Brony> bastards . . .
<HoodyNinja> actually right now its about the same level
<OtakuTom> Any time I hear '999', I can't help but think of 0 118 999 881 999 119 725 3
<JRP2234_> MakerDusk: whats your idle time
*MakerDusk pushes Cassy over :p
<MakerDusk> JRP2234_: probably very low
<XAX> Maker, isn't it the early hours of the morning for you? :|
<JRP2234_> noname you must have a name
<MakerDusk> 4:42am
<XAX> D:
<noname> JRP2234: It got stolen.
<Lunar_Brony> ohia noname
<Lunar_Brony> what was it?
<JRP2234_> makerdusk can i bring DJMidgetBrony to the party?
<OtakuTom> I've been known to read the ToC for some programs
<noname> Lunar_Brony: I've been here for hours, haha, and i've always been noname.
<MakerDusk> hmm, should totally organise the opers into a random channel raid
<Jmo4267> LOL sure OtakuTom
<MakerDusk> OtakuTom: read PonyChat's ToS
<MakerDusk> it is best ToS
<Lunar_Brony> I dared someone to red a ToC once
<MakerDusk> ^_^
<Wrek|Observiking> 05so how you been MakerDusk, all well?
<Knife> yay drawing time
<Lunar_Brony> we stopped after an hour of reading
<MakerDusk> still drawn out from a couple of days of migranes
<OtakuTom> Honest! I've read some...mainly the ones for World of Warcraft or any other sort of game I plan on livestreaming or doing a Let's Play of to make sure I don't get in trouble for it...lol
<Wrek|Observiking> 05ouchie
<XAX> Migraines? Ohdamn. Hope that comes right.
<Jmo4267> Uh-huh :P
<MakerDusk> XAX: well, I'm not seeing speckles floating around that don't exist anymore
<MakerDusk> so that's always a good sign ^_^
<Lunar_Brony> what if I am?
<Lunar_Brony> and I don't have a migraine?
<OtakuTom> For example, I'm in the beta for Reign of Thunder (a mechwarrior-style game). Unfortunately, it's a closed beta with a very strict NDA, so I'm not able to talk about anything regarding the game.
<XAX> MakerDusk: ._. I see the very occasional non-existant speckle, but were you getting them really bad?
<Lunar_Brony> did I hear a yay?
<Jmo4267> That's fair enough OtakuTom, know how that feels.
<MakerDusk> XAX: they all flow in the same direction and I try to follow them
<MakerDusk> I also black out
<MakerDusk> not a good combo >_<
<OtakuTom> Most ToS agreements are just "don't modify this program or make illegal copies of it"
<Lunar_Brony> I heard a yay
*Cassy rights self before pushing MakerDusk over
<MakerDusk> :O
<Lunar_Brony> ohai Cassy
<XAX> MakerDusk: i know the feel about trying to follow them lol, even though I don't get them combined with migraines. And damn, blackouts? D:
<Cassy> Howdy
<Lunar_Brony> We're becoming active!
<Knife> yay?
<Lunar_Brony> yes yay!
<Lunar_Brony> . . . or did you hear one?
*MakerDusk rights himself like one of those bobble thing that don't stay down and knocks Cassy back down when he comes back up

<P4ngya> a blank screen...?
<Chrysalis> that it is
<P4ngya> just got back so i duno whats goin on
<Chrysalis> everything
<Chrysalis> its been amazing
<Jmo4267> Wrek left on a stand-up comedy for us to watch while he went to do 'errands'. It ended and now you shall stare into the black screen until he is done.
<Jmo4267> ;D
<MadSurge> P4ngya: you missed Eddie Izzard being funny :D
<Jmo4267> ^
<Chrysalis> oh wow, FF3 is gonna be an Ouya launch title
<P4ngya> oh, thanks for the info though :)
<Jmo4267> Ikr Chrysalis
<Jmo4267> Gonna be awesome
<Chrysalis> i need to go get myself a box on pre-order
<Jmo4267> I'm gonna wait until I see some more decent titles to be released on it before I touch a pre-order.
<Jmo4267> But I have hopes for it.
<Chrysalis> publishers are starting to see people really want a new console
<Chrysalis> hopefully itll kick sony/ms to get a next gen out sooner
<Jmo4267> ^
<Chrysalis> cause nintendo are just dissapointing
<Jmo4267> lolnintendo
<Chrysalis> its not even next gen
<Chrysalis> the tech is all currentgen
<Jmo4267> They've done nothing but go downhill lately.
<Chrysalis> lately?
<Chrysalis> theyve been going downhil a LONG time
<Jmo4267> Ever since the Wii practically.
<Chrysalis> theyre attempts at attracting the "hardcore gamer" has been insulting at the elast
<Jmo4267> Yep
<P4ngya> I didn't even know they tried
<Chrysalis> yup
<Chrysalis> both on the wii and the wiiu
<Chrysalis> they said they were trying to attract hardcore to their systems
<P4ngya> like when they got CoD on there?
<Chrysalis> cause you know, hardcore gamers are renouned for using out of date technology and hardware, on games that have been slowed down
<Chrysalis> with unreliable controls
<P4ngya> I thought the wii was pretty cool when it came out
<prince-dari> I think most peopel thought that.
<prince-dari> people*
<prince-dari> Until they actually got one
<Jmo4267> and prince-dari appears.
<prince-dari> The only game I ever remember for wii that was good is Super Mario Galaxy
<Jmo4267> psht
<prince-dari> Well, Twilight Princess was pretty good too.
<Jmo4267> I bought the Wii for Metroid Prime 3/SMG1/2 and Twilight Princess.
<Jmo4267> Super Smash Bros. Brawl was alright
<Rain> if Shizuschlafen is schlafen, then how is she reconnecting...?
<Jmo4267> but meh
<P4ngya> can we agree that the most useless techonlogy to reach videogames was popout 3d?
<Jmo4267> ^
<Jmo4267> 3D is a joke overall.
<MadSurge> DS has just better games overall
<Quick_Thinker> night everypony
<Jmo4267> I would of liked the DS better if the graphics were decent enough.
<P4ngya> night Quick_Thinker
<MadSurge> At least imo
<JRP2234_> now im lonley
<Chrysalis> the 3ds was an appalling waste of money
<Jmo4267> ^
<Jmo4267> Dunno why I ended up buying it.
<JRP2234_> join me in skype people
<JRP2234_> im bored
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: you talk for yourself :D
<Chrysalis> i may talk of my own opinion
<Chrysalis> but its an opinion which is mirrored by alot of people i know
<Chrysalis> 3.7gb to upload to youtube
<Chrysalis> fun
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: I just think there's a few salvageable games on 3DS :D
<Chrysalis> MadSurge and do you ever play with the 3d actually on?
<Chrysalis> i know of no one that does
<Chrysalis> who puts motion controls
<Chrysalis> on a system which necessitates the head being VERY still
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: the 3d was a waste of money, no doubt
<Jmo4267> I rather gouge my eyes out.
<Chrysalis> i will give it one thing
<Chrysalis> its 3d was nicely done, it was mostly a depth into the screen
<Chrysalis> rather than coming out
<Chrysalis> but the screen had appalling viewing angles
<JRP2234_> hey
<DocSane> I wish I could stream something...
<JRP2234_> stfu for a min
<JRP2234_> 'join me in skype
<Chrysalis> maybe if someone else was talking

<Jmo4267> o_o
<killerpony7733> Jmo4267: Not sure, I had a blurry memory
<killerpony7733> I said over 100
<Jmo4267> It is well over that number.
<MadSurge> XAX: Doom 2 was my first "serious" game :D

<Jmo4267> Fair enough killerpony7733
<XAX> But Jmo4267, I'm just XAX.
<Jmo4267> First game related thing I touched was the Commodore 64 when I was 3.
<Chrysalis> i might spend too much time gaming, i played nearly double that
<Jmo4267> That bulky thing..
<Jmo4267> No XAX, you're an iPod now.
<XAX> Jmo4267: okayface.jpeg
<Jmo4267> ;D
<Chrysalis> anyone here remember carmageddon?
<Malmortius> While i was on the bicycle in the gym i kept looking at the clock behind me incase i was late, and there was a girl in the same direction. After about the 4th time of checking the time she said "Why do you keep looking at me?". So being the genius i am, i said "Sorry, you look like a friend of mine. Shes also very beautiful."
<killerpony7733> My mom had a copy and still has it around back home somewhere
<Malmortius> OH SNAP. IM SO AWESOME
<Jmo4267> I remember that game being banned in Australia.
<Jmo4267> ;_;
<Jmo4267> I've actually got a copy for PS1 in my hands. Knew it seemed familiar.
<Jmo4267> Imported from Italy or UK.

<Malmortius> While i was buying my sandwich and drink the woman behind the counter said "if you buy THIS sandwich(pointing to a different kind) you can get a free drink, both for £3.50! and i looked at the other sandwich and drink seperately, they came to £2.80. Wtf
<Jmo4267> Smart.
<Chrysalis> welcome to capitalism
<Malmortius> I asked her why it was more expensive since its supposed to be a deal. She just walked into the back LOL
<Jmo4267> aw
<Malmortius> So i went and got another sandwich from another shop..
<Malmortius> bastards
<Malmortius> All in all, an eventful day.

<Jmo4267> nomnomnom
<MadSurge> Guys, apparently the american flag on the moon fell over
<MadSurge> Luna's in a mood for pranks it seems :D
<Jmo4267> Care factor was thrown out the window.
<Jmo4267> Wonder if they'll fly back up there just to re-plant it.
<MadSurge> Jmo4267: I hope not
<Jmo4267> :P
<killerpony7733> That pleases me
<MadSurge> That would be a REAL waste of money
<Jmo4267> Like they don't waste enough money as it is.
<killerpony7733> ^^^^^^
<MadSurge> Jmo4267: exactly
<Jmo4267> I just find it funny that American is stationing a nuclear aircraft carrier near my city.
<Jmo4267> America*
<Jmo4267> Makes you wonder what they're up to.
<killerpony7733> Jmo4267: That's nothing if you could track and trace all known nuclear missile silos america has you would have your jaw drop
<Jmo4267> Yeah but out of all the places they could of made the deal.
<Jmo4267> Just makes me curious.
<Waffles> http://cheezburger.com/6219551744?siteId=136
<Jmo4267> ^
<Chrysalis> that riot officer
<Chrysalis> is not amused
<killerpony7733> Jmo4267: I'm happy that i live in a country that don't and never will have a nuclear arsenal
<Jmo4267> Yeah..
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: what country, again?
<killerpony7733> Denmark
<Jmo4267> heh Denmark
<killerpony7733> Yep a very peaceful country
<MadSurge> ^That doesn't apply to Italy unfortunately...
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Yeah you got the vatican on you and what nt
<killerpony7733> not*
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: which is more a hassle than anything else :(
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Yep italy has been more or less controlled by the elected popes throughout many years
<Jmo4267> Dem popes
<MadSurge> Thanks to them, no stem cells research, no legalized brothels (which would help economy) and a lot of hate for homos :(
<killerpony7733> They are generally keeping italy in the dark age to a point,
<MadSurge> John Paul II was much better
<killerpony7733> Or atleast they keep to old and very outdated morals
<MadSurge> ^^^^^^^^^^^
<Jmo4267> Poor Italy.
<JappleAck> good morning everypony
<MadSurge> Like Lovejoy from the Simpsons said, "according to the Bible we wouldn't even be allowed to go to the bathroom" :D
<Jmo4267> Morning JappleAck
<MadSurge> Hey JappleAck!
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: I could rant all idea about religion but for the sake of respect towards people who do i avoid it
<killerpony7733> day*
<JappleAck> sorry about earlier, my friend decided to be a troll and put that linlk in the chat
<JappleAck> *link
<MaxTheBrony> :s
<killerpony7733> JappleAck: Right you had done it like 2 or 3 times over the course of the past mont
<MaxTheBrony> Heya guys
<Jmo4267> Hey MaxTheBrony
<killerpony7733> month*
<MadSurge> Jmo4267: and that's why there's so many italians coming to america, less strict "morals" and more research spirit
<MaxTheBrony> Wich style on the mouth is best http://maxtheswed.deviantart.com/art/Rainbow-Dash-Wallpaper-1-WIP-PART-2-318509867
<Jmo4267> MadSurge: Understandable.
<Jmo4267> Right side tbh.
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: it's not all about religion, it's also about the people who become popes :P
<killerpony7733> ^Yeah the other while more sad in general just don't fit
<MaxTheBrony> :D allright
<MaxTheBrony> Oh ok thanks :D
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Just saying i could rant about how much religion has kept us back. But alas i shant rant about it here
<shana> I thought there is only one pope?
<shana> at least only one at a time :D
<MadSurge> MaxTheBrony: I like the left one better
<MaxTheBrony> :) Ah
<JappleAck> MaxTheBrony: That is so awesome!!
<MaxTheBrony> Thank you :D
<Jmo4267> I'm now gonna stalk your work.
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony: You would need a better angle to portray the left one better it looks a bit too out of place for me. From the angle you have the right one fits most honestly
<JappleAck> why is everyone better at drawing then me
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah i think so aswell actually :) it feels so much more fitting in a way
<Jmo4267> Cause they practice! :$
<MaxTheBrony> Every day
<MaxTheBrony> for hours
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<Jmo4267> ^
<MadSurge> shana: yeah, but I mean that while John Paul II travelled the world and was more tolerant in general, Benedict XVI is just... ugh. (also he looks like Palpatine)
<JappleAck> :S
<MaxTheBrony> Jmo4267: Thanks for the watch :D
<Jmo4267> I b lurkin'
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony: Like it looks like she is crying due to resentfullness
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah i got the idea from My little dashie :)
<Jmo4267> KNEW IT.
<MaxTheBrony> She is sad that she left home :D
<Jmo4267> Knew it was related to that.
<MaxTheBrony> and regrets it
<Jmo4267> Great job tbh.
<MaxTheBrony> Thank you :D
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony: Yeah that's why the right face with years works better in that regard, The other would work in another situation but looks to frowny and sad angry to fit
<shana> MadSurge: I know nearly nothing about popes, do they have any 'direct' political power?
<MaxTheBrony> killerpony7733: yeah :D
<MaxTheBrony> So To make this a good wallpaper what should i Add / remove?
<MaxTheBrony> The other Rd is going away but what more
<MadSurge> shana: officially not, but politicians will still back off immediately if he or the church says "this isn't right", and those who go against it are not taken seriously
<Jmo4267> I dunno MadSurge, maybe add a box full of stuff she liked? Like the NASCAR hat and such?
<Jmo4267> dunno.
<MadSurge> shana: this is allegedly to "conquer the christians' vote", but really now -__-
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony: Hmm let me see, The more nubby and female muzzle on the left is better fitting for oen
<killerpony7733> one*
<MaxTheBrony> ah so i should keep the Muzzle on the left? or should i correct the right one?
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony: The left one is alot more feminine
<MegaMoonShine> Helloooo everypony :$
<MaxTheBrony> heya MegaMoonShine :D
<killerpony7733> But the expression from the right one should be kept
<Jmo4267> Hey MegaMoonShine
*MegaMoonShine waves to MaxTheBrony and Jmo4267
<MaxTheBrony> That is quite funny cause i just changed the mouth on the left one :) its is exactly the same muzzle as the right one but its flipped , i wonder why it looks so different :D
<killerpony7733> Angle
<MaxTheBrony> Hmm yeah :)
<MaxTheBrony> Should i try keeping the right expression and just flipp it?
<killerpony7733> Possibly won't hurt trying
<MegaMoonShine> Then they'd both look the same?
<killerpony7733> Can always attempt to change something till you get it right
<Jmo4267> ^
<MaxTheBrony> yeah :)
<MaxTheBrony> the drawing will never be perfect :)
<MaxTheBrony> theres allways something i can change ^^
<Jmo4267> You draw via program w/ graphics tablet I'm guessing?
<MegaMoonShine> That is true Max
<MaxTheBrony> yeah :)
<Jmo4267> Nice :3
<MaxTheBrony> Im using same program as wrek :) Sai Paintool with a wacoombambo
<Jmo4267> Yeah Sai is good.
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony: Interestingly for a 16 year old you got very good artistic skills
<killerpony7733> :P
<MaxTheBrony> :D Thank you
<MadSurge> MaxTheBrony: I'm not worthy of using SAI :D
<MaxTheBrony> yes you are MadSurge :D
<Jmo4267> Anyone is worthy of using it.
<Jmo4267> :)
<killerpony7733> Just needs practice and skills to handle
<killerpony7733> :)
<MadSurge> I've always been better at monsters than humans :D
<killerpony7733> ^I can only draw stickman for serious
<MaxTheBrony> Im useless when it comes to anatomy :P
<MaxTheBrony> killerpony7733: its a good start ^^
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony: And it's been like that for years upon years
<MaxTheBrony> :D Try doing something other than humans^^
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony: Meh, I don't have the passion for drawing in the end. Hm still may i ask how the process wen't for you to draw RD?
<MaxTheBrony> I just sat down and drew circles for a while xD Then a shape came up in my head
<MaxTheBrony> it was a head looking downwards
<killerpony7733> But you say you are bad at anatomy?
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah i am :D
<killerpony7733> You clearly know the shape of the legs body and neck
<Jmo4267> HE LIES!
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Jmo4267> BURN THE WIZARD.
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<MaxTheBrony> I used refrences
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<Jmo4267> :P
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony: Pretty much what most artists do, Though some don't due to extremely good memory
<MaxTheBrony> heh i have zero memory xD
<Wrek|Observiking> 05so yeah
<killerpony7733> Having reference points and what not is good
<Jmo4267> And Wrek|Observiking returns.

<MadSurge> Alpha-Omega-Prime: that's the way :D

<Alpha-Omega-Prime> The game upis buggy enough that it kills some aspects of fun
<MadSurge> "Nope, not gonna save myself, just gonna go around and kick the fuck outta zombies!"
<AdamTheDuck> MaxTheBrony: Oh nothing major. Just the design phase for a text based adventure on kerbals overthrowing the reign of Phase's space craft massacre. :$
<MaxTheBrony> O.o

<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Compiling a list of music for a party
<MadSurge> God's cousin is named Ted? :D
<Jmo4267> End up laughing before I can say it.
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Yeah exactly
<Kandarihu> He gets so much stuff wrong.
<Lil_B> and another crash -.- how can this Programm be so unstable :/
<MaxTheBrony> what program?
<Lil_B> LMMS, it's what i use for music
<Lil_B> to make music *
<Jmo4267> Heh linux.
<Lil_B> for windows too
<Jmo4267> You aren't cool. ;-;
<Lil_B> I want to switch to Linux when Steam for Linux comes out
<Lil_B> I already tried many versions via virtual machine XD
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> It feels so akward getting party music
<Lil_B> why XD
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I dislike half the music people listen to to party
<AdamTheDuck> You're not alone Alpha-Omega-Prime ...
<Lil_B> yreah -.-
<Kandarihu> If I cannot speak out against this, then I REALLY have no place here.
<MegaMoonShine> I am there with you Alpha
<Wrek|Observiking> 05speak out agaisnt what?
<Kandarihu> Against this ridicule of my faith.
<SirGanjalf> oh hey, Eddie Izzard still here
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Thank you :)
<SirGanjalf> ?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> The only Solace I take in making this list is that Ponystep will be added to it
<SirGanjalf> BTW: Only my font has changed?
<Lil_B> brb need to restart
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i cant see the redicule really
<Wrek|Observiking> 05there's alot worse bashing done by comedians out there
<Wrek|Observiking> 05this is rather light on it really
<Lil_B> and back
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> ....I have to add slow dance music...any suggestions?
<Kandarihu> That's not very reassuring, but I guess this guy isn't quite as bad as George Carlin.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05well really he played a joke on what happened with god n dinosaurs before
<Wrek|Observiking> 05its not like utter bashing down
<AdamTheDuck> Alpha-Omega-Prime: Is Party With Pinkie on the list?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05honestly he bashes americans more than anything here
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Yes
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Of coourse
<Kandarihu> About that 65 million year gap, the way I figure it, God works on sort of a time dilation.
<MegaMoonShine> That's not really a slow dance song though
<AdamTheDuck> yeah it's not slow, I was just wondering if it's on :P
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Hey if It was up to me I would add nothing but rave music. Ninyll Scratch would be proud
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Vinyll
<MegaMoonShine> Alpha you should put Tombstone's "Like a spinning record"
<Jmo4267> I love that track^
<Wrek|Observiking> 05though i can see why you'd be insulted in a way
<Wrek|Observiking> 05well insulted might be a too strong word
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but anyways
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but each to their own
<Lil_B> Alpha-Omega-Prime use lots of Polka

<MadSurge> Saturn: I finally know what "cloud" means :D
<Phase4> 00,02sonicandmario85, steam is either still starting or its hiding somewhere
<Phase4> 00,02it has a love/hate relationship with wine
<Jim> I hate when steam just decides to hide
<sonicandmario85> XD
<sonicandmario85> i have it open right now
<Jim> It's like "Not showing up today, nope"
<sonicandmario85> i had to update it
<Jim> Try to open it again "Another instance of steam is running"
<Jim> .-.
<Kandarihu> Phase4, you can always kill it to be sure.
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: WHAT?
<sonicandmario85> try opening the task manager go in processes and then find steam.exe and right click on it and kill it
<Phase4> 00,02that moment when steam uninstalled itself from wine

<xxbignolanxx> Alright
<MegaMoonShine> Nice, Dark_Horst

<xxbignolanxx> Anyone in the mood for xbox BF3?
<Jim> nah
<texasboykc09> i just learn something new
<Dark_Horst> xxbignolanxx: you dont play battlefield 3 on a console
<Dark_Horst> that'S just something you dont do
<krazy> cant wait for the new dlc
<xxbignolanxx> Dark_Horst PC master race hue
<sonicandmario85> the print button wont work
<xxbignolanxx> krazy: Yeah the new DLC made me buy premium
<krazy> same :D
<Dark_Horst> xxbignolanxx: considering the pc version has better graphics, bigger maps and higher player-limits, yes, pretty much
<xxbignolanxx> I don't enjoy the hastle of pimping out a computer
<xxbignolanxx> besides
<krazy> I have it on xbox, only because my computer wont run itt
<xxbignolanxx> I have a bunch of IRL friends that play console because it is mroe casual
<xxbignolanxx> more*
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst I like that the Pirate Partie you can request "Pony Time" to stop the whole meeting for 22min for one ep of MLP XD
<Thrackerzod> Hai
<xxbignolanxx> What level are you, krazy?
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: the world need more parties like them
<xxbignolanxx> around about.
<Jim> hai Thrackerzod
<krazy> 20 ish, I dont really remember
<krazy> I havent played in a while
<Dark_Horst> getting a good pc is no hassle. order, done. i put mine together on alternate. took me 10 minutes
<xxbignolanxx> I think I'm a lvl 12 bird.
<xxbignolanxx> Yes, but I'm niggardly.
<krazy> dark hort: but I cant aford any good pc's
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst I don't like thatb the Pirate Partie has practikly no idea how to run the country other than more freedom and more technology, but concidering our current governent I would rather prefer people whomdon't know what to do over people who intentionally do everything wrong
<Lil_B> man, when I have a opinion I write a llot >.<
<xxbignolanxx> Yeah, I'm gonna play some BF3
<xxbignolanxx> I'll still be here though
<krazy> okie dokie

<Buytoast> because
<Chrysalis> lets you create minecraft instances
<ShadowD3mon25> That's off topic.
<Chrysalis> so you can keep a 1.2.5 client while also running a 1.3.1
<WindWhistler> Back to work! Just give me a ping if ya need me.
<Sumica> 00,10because bronys still like other things too

<killerpony7733> JacknAppleLover: Nope, No one knows much beyond official information
<JacknAppleLover> ah shame T_T
<JacknAppleLover> it looks so good.
<JacknAppleLover> i know they want it to be amazing, but tbh i dont care if its balanced it just looks so fun
<killerpony7733> JacknAppleLover: Also smart trick to respond to people is to type a bit of their name and press tab, That auto completes it and pings them
<JacknAppleLover> thanks for heads up
<JacknAppleLover> killerpony7733: ah ha

<killerpony7733> That reminds me i got two cans of strawberry cider in my fridge but i haven't gotten to drinking them yet
<MegaMoonShine> It' meant to be whiskey or something to me BronyDarth
<Tervicz> Maybe it's cider with extra cinnamon?
<BronyDarth> Cider doesnt have icecubes!
<MegaMoonShine> Maybe scotch
<JacknAppleLover> MaxTheBrony: i fav'd your picture btw ;D
<MaxTheBrony> Just saw that Thank you so Much JacknAppleLover :D

<killerpony7733> JacknAppleLover: Wait tuborg where are you from?
<Very_Silly_Filly> They might be wierd plastic cubes that bear no significance to this whole picture
<krazy> :3
<BronyDarth> Its chocolate milk with rarity in it.
<JacknAppleLover> Very_Silly_Filly: they're not ice cubes they're marshmellows O_O
<Very_Silly_Filly> Or it could just be cola with coke in it
<Buytoast> psst
<Buytoast> guess what
<Buytoast> it's scotch
<Tervicz> Couldn't it be just a kind of Coke or Rutebeer?
<cratorkid> killerpony7733: recently its been hapenning at 3- 5 am at the east coast of us , i think htas like 9 for you , im not sure
<MegaMoonShine> Looks too light to be cola

<JacknAppleLover> pony59780: its 17 for me
<BronyDarth> Cola.

<MegaMoonShine> Maybe it's iced coffee
<Underpony> 1) Eat two bananas

<alexxm> SpadeMagnes[R] are they good
<teastri> LOUDER
<MegaMoonShine> Turn up the mic sumi
<Serenity> SpadeMagnes[R]: I mainly watch Josh jepson if I want lets plays
<Jim> He can't
<Jim> His mic is as loud as it gets
<Serenity> Which I usually don't, because most letsplayers have NFC what they're doing and take ages
<teastri> :(
<Shooeie> This again...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So how will we be going about murdering kerbals today?
<teastri> so i´ll hear my music :P
<teastri> am i in the right place here :S
<Shooeie> Sumi maybe you sould consider Aerodynamics this time.
<Lil_B> I like Video Games Awesome... I don't get why they don't et more fews (and I watch Game Grumps when they started XD)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Fuck aerodynamics
<teastri> i like trains
<Serenity> Oh, it's a shuttl
<Jim> Aerodynamics is overrated, just make it a huge cube
<Shooeie> Finally something that can fly
<Serenity> Jim: Make it a huge cup
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Needs more boost
<Serenity> So you get the parachute effect
<Jim> Fly through space in a giant cup, excellent
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Give it more boost than Sonic Unleashed
<Serenity> Advanced SAS?
<Shooeie> You need more boost tho
<Shooeie> A single engine wont last it.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> use ALL the engines
<Serenity> Guys, do you know what I want?
<Jim> Don't think he's aiming for the moon
<teastri> oh come one... make some music :X
<Jim> He's aiming for kerbals to kill
<JacknAppleLover> so what is the aim of this game?
<Serenity> A new computer :3. El shitbox is well. Shit
<MegaMoonShine> Don't forget to add wheels
<Jim> JacknAppleLover, To reach the moon
<SpadeMagnes[R]> To slaughter kerbals
<Jim> ^
<alexxm> kill all the kerbals
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Getting to the moon is a bonus
<JacknAppleLover> surely just kick Celestia in the flank and getting there would be easy
<Serenity> Getting to Mars is Aisian level
<teastri> ok... y did this work oO
<SpadeMagnes[R]> NEEDS MORE SPEED
<MadMan> interesting
<Shooeie> You will need more thrusters.
<Jim> ALL the thrusters
<SpadeMagnes[R]> inb4 the RCS goes out of wack

<SpadeMagnes[R]> This isnt even my final form
<Serenity> Yeah, they've been around a while
<Jim> SpadeMagnes[R], lol
<alexxm> it needs about 20% more explosions
<Serenity> An enitre 2 versions
<MadMan> i think it was Sim'd youtube actually
<RobertRevenge> This game requires more patience and eye for detail than I'd be willing to give.
<JacknAppleLover> MadMan: omg same here xd

<Serenity> MaxTheBrony: Nope, just fine
<Kandarihu> Looks like a spear or an arrow.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ah.. clippy
<StinkomanFan> SpadeMagnes[R] A german hotdog
<SpadeMagnes[R]> How I hate him
<MegaMoonShine> Seems fine to me Max
<MadMan> looks like a WEINER O_o
<teastri> what is this game called???
<Serenity> no homo
<killerpony7733> Jim: Can you give me a link in PM about that?
<JacknAppleLover> MadMan: so far it looks like they making a giant rocketcock to reach the moon and kill some kerbal things along the way
<Shooeie> The Aerodynaimcs....
<MegaMoonShine> teastri: Kerbal Space Program
<MadSurge> Is it time for Sumica to kill more Kerbals? :D

<JacknAppleLover> Serenity: do u also believe in dog?
<Aviators> This thing looks like it's gonna crash
<MaxTheBrony> It is kalled Somthing with space programm xD
<Aviators> Or maybe that's just wishful thinking
<Aviators> xD
<RobertRevenge> JacknAppleLover: Dude, that was low.

<StinkomanFan> You think he's Compansating for something?
<Serenity> JacknAppleLover: Wait, what?

<JacknAppleLover> SpadeMagnes[R]: /)
<Jim> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk8VdtjNsE8
<Buytoast> a guy whose youtube character is more annoying than 15 jar jar binks
<Dken2021> oh wrek's done?
*SpadeMagnes[R] breaks the rules
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Who is worse... Fred or Jar Jar?
<JacknAppleLover> SpadeMagnes[R]: u hax on zelda?
<Serenity> I play legit
<Jim> Dken2021, Aye, Sumi is streaming as soon as he's reset his computer
<Jim> So KSP incoming
<Serenity> Already kicked Master quest's arse on OOT
<Jim> http://i.imgur.com/Lt9oZ.png
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Only cheating I did was use a ingame password for all 64 rings
<JacknAppleLover> simgretina is awesome.

<Buytoast> who gets hit by iron knuckles?
<Dark92Enigma> SpadeMagnes[R]: Tough call..........I can BARELY STAND Jar Jar.......i can't even LISTEN AT FRED. .........i would shoot them BOTH to death, but i would shoot Fred first
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Onyx from Oracle of Seasons makes me think of Iron Knuckels
<Buytoast> jar Jar isn't that bad except for his sole purpose of being a comic relief plot device
<Buytoast> fred is just a waste of space
<Jim> ^
<Flyboy|Gaming> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/RX/
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So which is the more lethal incarnation of the knuckles? OOT/MM or Twilight Princess?
<JacknAppleLover> if you removed jarjar and all his lines but left in all the other characters lines to Jarjar. film would be awesome
<Gatamer> This Guy.
<cratorkid> Bambo'Fun made by Wacom
<JacknAppleLover> Flyboy|Gaming: LOL
<Serenity> SpadeMagnes[R]: OoT's

<derpy_pony> http://christwire.org/2012/02/the-sick-truth-behind-my-little-pony-meetups/ this is new :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Didnt one time religious nuts called Harry Potter satanic or something?
<Firefox> Celestia*
<sonicandmario85> derpy_pony:bronys are not sexual atleast im not
<sharklion> SpadeMagnes[R]: yeah
<derpy_pony> christwire was better a few years ago
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Are they retarded?
<Vivix> Brony is all kinds of things to all kinds of people
<AttacktheAndalite> SpadeMagnes[R]: A lot of people said that
<Discord> Sumica: I'm guessing it's impossible to get to the moon in this game?
<Serenity> Religious people have problems with everything
<derpy_pony> nowadays everyone knows that they aren't real
<Cow> and again he dedz
<sonicandmario85> Discord:ITS POSSIBLE TO GET TO IT PHASE4 DID
<sharklion> SpadeMagnes[R]: and everyone. it's a very small minority of otherwise sensible people
<AttacktheAndalite> Sumica: Or horribly horribly right, depending on how you look at it
<derpy_pony> sonicandmario85: most asexual people on the planet :P
<Buytoast> apparently not everyone
<SpadeMagnes[R]> But where is the fun in getting to the moon Sumica ?
<Cow> But Sumica luna needs an an ARCHER HERO TO save her
<Firefox> hahhah
<alexxm> so you could rescue luna
<Thrackerzod> Serenity now thats a steriotype because im religious, but i guess im an evil person and i hate everything
<Vivix> most religious people are nice
<Vivix> just like most people are nice
<Meanwhile> No religious talk in chat.
<Serenity> Thrackerzod: You aren't helping your cause :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Thrackerzod: So how is life as a perfectly normal pony
<Serenity> I agree, we should stop tjhis before it leads to war
<sharklion> can I ask what the hell is going on in general around here?
<Serenity> I kinda can't do with my gunshed being blown up
<Vivix> We're watching spaceships crash
<Thrackerzod> SpadeMagnes[R] im great
<Firefox> 360!?
<Firefox> :o
<Tovler> because atheist are so beloved in… *brick walls*

<Firefox> xd
<cow334> DO A BARREL ROLL
<sharklion> spaceships? crashing? awesome!
<Firefox> D:<
<Serenity> Tovler: I've always been a cavity wall fan
<derpy_pony> prince-dari: this is not wave 5. this is wave 4
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sonic has a really broken fanbase
<Firefox> Dont say Barrels pls :'(
<cow334> IM NOT SONIC ]
<cow334> IM MY ORIGNAL CHARECTOR
<Vivix> I really want more blindbag ponies
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I mean seriously people bitched about Sky Sanctuary in Generations not being yellow enough
<Vivix> but the toys r us stores around here dont have anything
<Serenity> And I'm not tails, I'm my original character, Blails!
<derpy_pony> http://www.ebay.com/sch/quills_and_sofas/m.html I have a few Wave 5 here. Luna, Celestia, Trixie, etc.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Serenity: Oh no! I'm inflating again!
<Firefox> best game eva :o
<cow334> PEOPLE really need to get there facts right
<Serenity> How embarrasing
<Vivix> Trixie!?
<Buytoast> the sonic fanbase is about the same wavelength as the pony one
<Meanwhile> derpy_pony: That's a bot response coded to give us the EqD title. Blame them if it's wrong.
<Vivix> God I need that
<derpy_pony> oh...
<sonicandmario85> AND IM NOT TAILS EITHER IM MY FAN CHARACTER JAKE THE FOX i do not know why i named him that XD
<Meanwhile> derpy_pony: And no non image links during the stream.
<cow334> How EMMBERISING
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Is it wrong for me to hate part of the MLP fandom because some people make us look like a cult?
<derpy_pony> hm...
<Firefox> eh foxes :P
<Tovler> Serenity: I like adobe walls myself
<Serenity> I have to be honest, there's about as many fucktard ponyfags as there are fucktard sonicfags
<Buytoast> i hate a vast majority of the mlp fanbase
<cow334> ...yeah that is true
<Vivix> all fandoms have people you won't like
<cow334> kinda
<sharklion> it's fine to hate. just don't hate where I can hear it
<Discord> I wish I could watch someone on here land on the moon.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> GO PARTS
<Firefox> :O
<Meanwhile> It's ok to not like things, it's ok, but don't be a dick about it.
<Serenity> I look at youtube sometimes, and I remember why I once hated this community
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03The sonic fandom died when Sonichu appeared...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What the fuck is Kerbalia's water made of?!
<Buytoast> no
<Buytoast> it merely tranceded
<AttacktheAndalite> suddenly Scoot-Scootaloo
<derpy_pony> oh my...someone linked my ebay stuff on eqd ^^
<Vivix> There's many parts of the fandom that don't speak to me, but I don't hate any of it, I think.
<Discord> Sumica: can you crash onto the sun?
<derpy_pony> explains everything
<Thrackerzod> AWWW Shit the Chats full of warriors today, well im off to lunch before the shitstorm gets good
<Firefox> mozilla dont come :(

<Tovler> Meanwhile: What? I thought we were having a shitstorm.
<Buytoast> didn't phase4 make it to the moon a week or a few days ago?
<Serenity> I've managed to land on mars before
<Serenity> And explode
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So who here has played Legend of Zelda Oracle of Ages/Seasons
<Serenity> I had a parachute failure just as I was landing
<alexxm> Serenity what was mars like
<Meanwhile> Tovler: You're better than that. Don't incite chat.
<Shooeie> So we going tot he moon?
<sharklion> SpadeMagnes[R]: me
<Buytoast> inciting chat is my job
<Serenity> alexxm: My team died from the landing becuase I blew up
<sonicandmario85> Buytoast:yes he even uploaded the stream on youtube
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile: entice*
<cow334> he dosent want to go to the moon
<cow334> :<
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Do any of you think a hd or 3d remake of it would be a good idea?
<Discord> Sumica can you go inside one of the gas planets?
<Lil_B> SpadeMagnes[R] I played Seasons
<yifle1> i heard about it
<sharklion> oh, hello alexxm. how are you?
<Meanwhile> AttacktheAndalite: Not even the word I was using.
<Buytoast> don't remake 2d games as 3d
<alexxm> i'm good sharklion how about you
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile: Whuups....*braces for cinderblock*
<Buytoast> unless you're willing to change the gameplay
<sharklion> I am also good alexxm
<cow334> the tone sounds the same to this beat but it is still good
<Vivix> entice is to tempt in a good way
<Discord> Sumica someone said there was mars o.o?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What about updating the sprite work?
<Meanwhile> AttacktheAndalite: Incite: To provoke or encourage.
<Firefox> Flamer -.-
<Firefox> xd
<cow334> lawl Firefox
<Vivix> yes
<Vivix> Entice is a positive word
<Tovler> Meanwhile: Yeah, but it's not a serious opinion outside of Tumblr, so… idunno
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile: I've heard entice but not incite.
<cow334> he made my computer...AMAZING
<Vivix> Intice is a negative word, as far as I know
<Meanwhile> AttacktheAndalite: entice: to attract by arousing hope or desire.
<Flyboy|Gaming> Discord: well theres minmus, which is like mars
<Vivix> look it up on oxford dictionary, beats the crap out of wiktionary
*Meanwhile slam dunks AttacktheAndalite with a cinderblock.
<sharklion> to intice someone into doing something..... I'm not sure if it's either
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Onyx in seasons is a dick.. he uses Din as a human sheild in part of his boss fight
<Buytoast> don't spil shit
<Buytoast> spoil
<sonicandmario85> MORE KERBALS? LOL
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Dude the game is old

<Discord> woah
<Tovler> (Hmm, this is a good Foongus. I think I'll train it.)
<sonicandmario85> more kerbals in the ship
<Vivix> incite: encourage or stir up (violent or unlawful behaviour):
<Lil_B> in terms Of Zelda: MM=The Best , LA=My Fav

<Lil_B> I have an important Anouncement to make!
<AttacktheAndalite> Oh I like this song

<Discord> lol
<Lil_B> Somebody set up us the Bomb!
<AttacktheAndalite> What is it, Lil_B
<Chrysalis> homai
<sonicandmario85> this looks like it might work
<sharklion> I think that LoZ: MM or Ocarina was the best. My favourite is probably Twilight Princess thinking about it... I very much enjoyed that game!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Lil_B: Make your time
<Chrysalis> sumica you do realise your taking off
<Discord> Sumica: USE THE BIGGEST PROPULSIONS!
<Chrysalis> not burning a 30 foot hole in the ground
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Given my track record streaming, I'd say it's trollin'~
<sharklion> Lil_B: how based are you at the moment?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Where did the idea for mario come from anyway?
<AttacktheAndalite> 20 bits it explodes at the runway
<Buytoast> Am I the only one who played Skyward Sword?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Buytoast: I enjoyed it

<Buytoast> It had its moments.
<Chrysalis> Scoot-Scootaloo servers 1.3.1 now
<Serenity> I don't usually see Scoot-Scootaloo, but when I do, it's G3
<Meanwhile> Scoot-Scootaloo: Because my heart's made of frost.
<AttacktheAndalite> StinkomanFan, Sumi will find a way.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I get it, it's because he's British :|
<sonicandmario85> THE MINECRAFT 1.3.1 UPDATES EPIC
<Serenity> Meanwhile: I thought it was made of Cinderblocks?
<Meanwhile> That too.

<Serenity> Ahh, okay

<Serenity> I watched my friend stream it yesterday
<Buytoast> Zombie sex.
<Flyboy|Gaming> wait, so is 1.3.1 out?
<alexxm> why
<Chrysalis> people still play technic
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The idea of zombies reproducing disgusts me
<Serenity> Other than all the hilarity that went on, it was crap
<sonicandmario85> Vivx:go to options and force update easy
<Buytoast> I'd pay for that
<Vivix> Honey, did you pull out? "I think so."
<StinkomanFan> HOW IS IT EVEN FITTING IN THE HANGER?
<Om-stone> The shadow looks like the android robot
<Vivix> I can but most of technic is not compatible with 1.3.1
<AttacktheAndalite> Om-stone: It DOES
<Chrysalis> none is
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sweetie Belle!
<Vivix> it's set at 1.1 with the 6.0.7 update I like
<Chrysalis> forge isnt 1.3.1 yet
<Dashee> Android robot with a big dong
<AttacktheAndalite> Is there a pony of the little Android bot thing? I want to draw it

<Michael> dat archery skill
<owloysius> i have to
<Sumica> 00,10you would have to ask super
<Vivix> I think I'll do that if I see him
<Kandarihu> The only shows I've known of him streaming are King of the Hill, American Dad, and Bob's Burgers... and something else, I forgot.
<teastri> enjoing :D
<cow334> dem grahpics
<Michael> lolwut
<RustyMeat> stargate?
<Vivix> I'm so infrequent on these sites I am never up to date on what you guys stream
<AttacktheAndalite> What the fuck is that? Looks like a flying scorpion with wings
<RustyMeat> hmmmm dirt
<MaxTheBrony|Drawing> Yer
<RustyMeat> lol what
<Meanwhile> lol. I'm trying to quit.
<MaxTheBrony|Drawing> xD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> =/
<Scooterview> 00,03I stream the Boondocks!
<AttacktheAndalite> Vivix: The only thing that's actually scheduled here is BMN or when the mods stream trilogies
<Vivix> ah yeah-
<AttacktheAndalite> Vivix: It normally sorta random the rest of the week
<Scooterview> 00,03Because everyone loves an anime about thugs~
<Vivix> yeah- I remember that-
<MaxTheBrony|Drawing> xD
<Lil_B> its like master and Padavan
<Kandarihu> Scooterview, I don't love that show.
<Michael> orly
<Dken2021> indeed we do scoots
<AttacktheAndalite> Scooterview: Boondocks isn't an anime, it just looks like it
<Sumica> 00,10dat speed math
<Meanwhile> Daaaaaamn
<owloysius> afro samurai is, i think
<Vivix> I listened to visual kei (and still do) for almost 8 years, and never really watched anime or manga
<teastri> o gott... ponys are everywhere :D
<Chrysalis> lookin goood
<Dken2021> owloysius it is
<owloysius> k
<teastri> my desktop is conquert xD
<Lil_B> it only means his planet circles their sun rather quick
<AttacktheAndalite> teastri: Do you have the Pinki Pie desktop pony on?
<Discord> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
<RustyMeat> I see woona onscreen :3
<Dken2021> teastri you must've uswed desktop pony for the first time
<teastri> now yes xD
<Kandarihu> Boondocks is produced by a Japanese animation team, but based on the writings of an American newspaper comic artist and it's intended for American audiences. To me, that doesn't qualify for anime.
<Michael> woona is soooo cuteee
<Vivix> Anime is just a style, isn't it?
<Michael> <3
<Vivix> Or wwell technically a word that just means animated
<teastri> hehe... havnt head of it befor xD
<MaxTheBrony> :3
<Dken2021> Vivix pretty much yea
<Ponies47> Ok. I'm back. Steam is working now :P
<MaxTheBrony> Wb Ponies47 :d
<Vivix> So yeah, I don't think the anime's origins would matter if it looks like it is what it is
<AttacktheAndalite> Ponies47: Yaaay
<Kandarihu> To me and a lot of anime fans, Anime pretty much means it's JAPANESE in origin, no foreign source material or foreign market targetting from the beginning.
<Michael> Wb Ponies47
<shana> Vivix: no sorry, an animation means its animated. Anime really is a style.
<Dken2021> teastri well unless your computer has like a beast RAM and processor, running all the poinies might kill it
<Vivix> Well, yeah it is a style
<Vivix> but it's etymylogy
<teastri> xD
<Vivix> (I can't spell that word)
<Vivix> and its, not it's
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<MaxTheBrony> what is that word even
<Scooterview> 00,03It's the closest thing to an anime that I will stream that isn't a parody >: D
<teastri> thats y i closed em as soon as possible... but now my 2 favs are on it :D
<Vivix> word's origin and history
<Michael> omg
<cowlFilly> KILL HIM HE is attracting them
<Meanwhile> Oh shiiiiit.
<Vivix> like Anime would be etomylogically animation
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<MaxTheBrony> Teal'c
<Kandarihu> Scooterview, would you consider Ore Imo to be a parody?
<Midnight_Splendor> Hi everypony
<teastri> pinkie and rainbow :D
<teastri> hi :D
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Midnight_Splendor
<Dken2021> hai Midnight_Splendor
<AttacktheAndalite> Hello Midnight_Splendor
<Ponies47> Ohai Scooterview
<Vivix> I'm addicted to beck atm.. oh yeahh folk riffs
<Ponies47> Hey Midnight_Splendor
<Midnight_Splendor> yay Stargate.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hi Midnight_Splendor
<Vivix> The only thing I noticed while trying to watch Anime is that they put art over animation, the animation is realllyyy cheap, but the drawings are usually pretty nice
<Scooterview> 00,03Ehhh no
<Vivix> it's --different, but nice, kinda
<Discord> STALKER!
<Vivix> they have 2 lipsync changes instead of 16, and static talk scenes instead of dynamic
<teastri> but there isnt the insane version of twilight :D
<teastri> its missing :S
<MaxTheBrony> I hate the animation In king of the hill and beevis and butthead <.< it makes me sick :S
<Kandarihu> Vivix, I really like the way they cut corners.
<Vivix> Haven't seen either in yeaaars
<Vivix> It's a taste thing, Anime looks nice
<WindWhistler> Both make me sick in general.
<Vivix> I like the look of it, but not the animation, I'm much more fond of fluid dynamic like..Bambi or MLP
<MaxTheBrony> yeah
<MaxTheBrony> but i dont like the look either xD
<Vivix> hehe
<teastri> god... this song makes me wanna play minecraft :D
<Vivix> Yeah it's a taste thing
<MaxTheBrony> true
<alexxm> acting
<MaxTheBrony> its relative
<Kandarihu> By fluid dynamic, do you mean the style where everyone constantly moves their bodies all the time?
<Vivix> noo-
<WindWhistler> I hate it when people accuse me of drawing anime when I can't help how I draw...
<MaxTheBrony> WindWhistler: have any pic :3?
<Vivix> reaction shots and moving scenes, more scene changes and facial expressions
<cowlFilly> Bye every one
<cowlFilly> woohoo
<MaxTheBrony> Bye Cpw
<WindWhistler> MaxTheBrony: Well actually that was more of a general statement.
<MaxTheBrony> cowlFilly:
<Dken2021> take care cowlFilly
<Lil_B> bye cowlFilly
<MaxTheBrony> Ah WindWhistler ^^
*cowlFilly yaay
<Michael> bye cowFilly
<Ponies47> Bye cowlFilly
<WindWhistler> Like there was this one person who said they hate cartoons that try to act like anime.
<Ponies47> Hey WindWhistler :P
<teastri> my screen just got 20% cooler :3
<MaxTheBrony> teastri: Nice :3
<Firefox> BB cowlFilly >:3
<WindWhistler> Then one person pointed out that it's just the style of the artist.
<owloysius> she's dumb
<Vivix> yeah
<MaxTheBrony> heh
<Vivix> the artist developing and the team working design really decides the look ofa show
<Michael> dat *god*
<Ponies47> teastri: DekstopPonies?
<Dken2021> WindWhistler I hate those types of people
<teastri> hehe... now i know y some of my frinds call me bronie xD
<XAX> Oh, erm. Morning all
<Malavolent> Ello the-omfg Luna and miniWoona!
<Meanwhile> Allo XAX.
<Dken2021> evening XAX
<Ponies47> *DesktopPonies
<teastri> and sure :D
<MaxTheBrony> Heya XAX :D! Morning
<Michael> hai XAX
<Lil_B> hi there XAX
<AttacktheAndalite> Hello XAX
<Kandarihu> Ah. Okay. My standard for a good animation style is that if characters are moving without purpose, then money got wasted on the animation budget.
<Ponies47> Hey XAX
<Vivix> well, all I care about is the end result
<Firefox> hai XAX :)
<alexxm> how you doing XAX
<Vivix> and anime is usually not cheaper in money than western animation, just different priorotiez
<MaxTheBrony> Kandarihu: But if its done right its beautiful :d
<XAX> Good thanks alexxm
<Vivix> Bambi is absolutely beautiful work of animation
<WindWhistler> Like MLP even though it uses Flash
<teastri> i think ill play some minecraft... see ya guys :3
<Vivix> and it's just the type I prefer, I can't really feel the characters if they only have two faces during a 2 minute talking scene
<Michael> Vivix: and an amazing plot
<Dken2021> seeya teastri
<Vivix> yees
<Firefox> PLOTS O.O
<MaxTheBrony> Bye tea... Aw :(
<WindWhistler> ...........
<Vivix> MLP uses amazing mix of flash rigging and frame by frame traditional animation
<Vivix> it just looks fluid without being expensive
<Firefox> my face -----> O_o
<Kandarihu> One Saturday night, I had this in mind when I was watching Bleach, and I noticed that it did everything right. Characters were moving for every possible concievable reason, but they never moved without purpose. THAT is what I prefer to see in my animation.
<Ponies47> O.O
<MaxTheBrony> But Mlp have beutiful environment
<Firefox> -.-
<Meanwhile> Dat flaw.
<Vivix> yyeah, it's a preferance, I've only really seen parts of death note and some other animes
<Firefox> DAT FLANK O.O
<WindWhistler> .......
<Vivix> where I just didn't like how statiac everythign was
<Firefox> GOD :(
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<Firefox> :'(
<owloysius> good. Throw a vending machine at it.
<Michael> Firefox: wtf
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Sumica> 00,10you would need augs for that owloysius
<Lil_B> how about a Brick... or a Stone... they fly even slower!
<Vivix> What's good about modern animation is that you can have that classic dynamic and reactionary speed and details without spending a loto f money on it
<MaxTheBrony> haha xD
<owloysius> i didn't ask for this.
<Meanwhile> Nox're allready using stealth augs sumi. :P
<Lil_B> dat Log
<Lil_B> like Flint :P

<MaxTheBrony> love that guy
<MaxTheBrony> omg
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: have you ever seen pokemn anime? they hardly move at all, and there's like 3 frames per movement
<Meanwhile> Again.
<Discord> OH SHIPE
<Firefox> SNIPES >:3
<Firefox> SNiper only :D
<Vivix> talking in pokemon is like 2 frames, repeated in pseudo lipsync
<owloysius> the soldier's a spy
<Firefox> ponymon*
<Firefox> xD
<owloysius> where
<Michael> the hell?
<Firefox> *shrug*
<Firefox> xd
<Michael> he's a spy
<Firefox> o.o
<Firefox> not sniper ?! :'(
<twilight_sprinkle> Vivix: yeah, i dont even count that as movement since the only difference in the frames is the mouth open/shut. i bet you can even copy-paste it without redrawing
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> I think that's why they did it
<Vivix> Talking is cheap in animation
<Sumica> 00,10the nox are not weak
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02Sniper no sniping, Sniper no sniping, SNIPER NO SNIPING >>
<owloysius> a castle in the sky

<Chrysalis> big badass ship
<Firefox> >.>
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> =/
<Vivix> That's one of the reasons I love mlp, talking is like..even the bg actors like..Rarity in a scene between Twi and Shy reacts and moves
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:<
<Vivix> It's beautiful
<Michael> dat gate
<Firefox> so who is Sniper :O

<Marx> Reminds me of the Chozo.

<WindWhistler> Vivix: But they keep copy and pasting ponies for crowds.
<Firefox> Derp :o
*Meanwhile pats SuperBrony64.
*WindWhistler glomps SuperBrony64
*SuperBrony64 hugs Meanwhile ;A;
<Vivix> Oh yeah, saves a lot of time and money
*SuperBrony64 hugs WindWhistler back :D
<Firefox> potatoes
<Vivix> they only have 6 months on an episode? Simpsons have 9months, and it's all hand drawn
<Dark_Horst> did oneill just wise?
<Flyboy|Gaming> YYYEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHH!!!!!!
*AttacktheAndalite gives SuperBrony64 a hug and a filly Twilight
<Firefox> THE END ?! :O
<Flyboy|Gaming> Firefox: nope, chuck testa
<Firefox> YES
*SuperBrony64 hugs AttacktheAndalite back and plays with the filly Twilight :D
<Vivix> I think as they expand their library of bg ponies we get less and less repeating chars in crowds
<Chrysalis> there needs to be dirt stairs in minecraft
<Lil_B> sooo.... they didn't brought back tecnology...
<Michael> :O a filly twilight! <3
<Kandarihu> I admit that the animation style in Pokemon can be underwhelming during the dialog.
<Sumica> 00,10I has a filly twi

<MaxTheBrony> :s my internet
<Flyboy|Gaming> Lil_B: nope, they brung back dead babies

<Flyboy|Gaming> Meanwhile: CHOOOOCALATE!!!

<MaxTheBrony> I must know its name :D
<Firefox> -.-
<Firefox> :I
<valoreins|Drawing> what's a pony?
<Kandarihu> CGI has been absurdly focused on hyper-realism. I would honestly like to see what can be done in CGI with anime-style corner-cutting.
<Discord> I haven't seen ponies on here for like 2 days >.<
<CrimsonPhoenix> MaxTheBrony, just check on Dash's Determination
<Michael> MaxTheBrony: dat RD
<SimGretina> Needs more ʸᵃʸ
<Lil_B> valoreins|Drawing what is a man?!
<Firefox> ponies everywhere <3
<Vivix> CGI can be great, but CGI is tween animation
<MaxTheBrony> Michael: :D
<Vivix> I hate CGI in live action movies
<valoreins|Drawing> Lil_B: miserable pile of friendship
<Michael> MaxTheBrony: nice job BTW
<MaxTheBrony> Michael: Thank you so much :D
<Lil_B> valoreins|Drawing Enough Talk! Have at you!
<Vivix> Also, correction, you can animate CGI same way you would traditional- so it's not solely tween
<valoreins|Drawing> :D
<Discord> :'(
<Firefox> NOOO
<CrimsonPhoenix> this video

<Lil_B> brb
<MaxTheBrony> So awesome :s

<MaxTheBrony> CrimsonPhoenix: It is <3
<Firefox> OwO
<SimGretina> magical
<Vivix> I wonder if Beck's truckdriving neighbour is his realy neighbour in the screaming sample
<Kandarihu> Actually, I downloaded this one anime series that might server as an interesting inspiration for that. It's called Happy Kappi and it's REALLY childish. I only keep it because there's a magical mascot voiced by Emiri Katou (Kyubey), and of course the fact that it's all an interesting take on CGI
<Firefox> Neutral pONIES <3

*Chains is reading a dictionary
<StinkomanFan> ...I was a tree
<[wub]ehren> ReLigion

<cachi01|CaveStory> DO NOT EAT
<Dken2021> >put up a sign

<Cypresswolf> G-d humming Happy Birthday with no angelic choir?
<Chains> WAKE UP D:<
<Nyst> The man's words sound very wise, with a sense of clarity, but they have this aura of sadness about them. Do you think that's intentional?
<Chains> Wat
<Obsidian> poke poke
<StinkomanFan> :D
<cachi01|CaveStory> godpoke
<StinkomanFan> GODDAMNIT ADAM
<cachi01|CaveStory> oh wait no lol
<Chains> This is frightening
<StinkomanFan> THE CREATION OF MAN
<Nyst> In any case, he sounds like a man born before his time.
<DocSane> RobertRevenge: I see nothing on the Mane6 web site.
<RobertRevenge> DocSane: Let me get the mediafire
<Chains> o_o
<[wub]ehren> fjigobkrjegoilejr

<DocSane> Shamroc: I suppose.
<twilight_sprinkle> oh fighting is magic released??awesuuuum
<cachi01|CaveStory> twilight_sprinkle: a leaked version
<Nyst> How can it be paradise? I never got that. I'd be bored out of my mind.
<cachi01|CaveStory> i think
<StinkomanFan> In the bible it said that Eve was created with Adam's Rib... but whatever
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01|CaveStory: is it legal?
<cachi01|CaveStory> CAN I GET LINK?
<Chains> O_O

<Cypresswolf> Adam was wise to try to get away :P
<StinkomanFan> This must be what Celestia's first subjects were like
<[wub]ehren> men cant even talk
<DocSane> A Valentine tree
<RobertRevenge> cachi01: Looks like the file was taken down from Mediafire

<DocSane> ShiningArmor: The Adventures of Mark Twain.
<Cypresswolf> CAMO
<owloysius> colour by numbers
<StinkomanFan> THE PERFECT DISGUISE
<DocSane> ShiningArmor: A fantastically weird artifact of the 80s.
<Cypresswolf> HA! you tell her Adam
<Dken2021> so it is true, someone did leak the mane6 evo build
<owloysius> rest or get stoned
<twilight_sprinkle> forever alone

<Spectrum_Rush> ¬_¬
<StinkomanFan> GODDAMNIT WOMAN
<Chains> Quieter
<owloysius> hahaha
<potato_pony> D:

<Dken2021> so women invented science
<potato_pony> yep
<Cypresswolf> nice touch with the match in the serpent's mouth
<StinkomanFan> Dken2021, then we stole it back
<Vordox> Dken2021: Theory of releeverythingatitvyt <--- By Women. :P
<Meanwhile> No gender war in chat.
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<owloysius> huh
<cachi01> fsmmit
<[wub]ehren> MEN

<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello everypony.
<cachi01> hi ZappyTheUnicorn!
<Dken2021> she wants death, oh god
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi ZappyTheUnicorn
<Obsidian> Hello ZappyTheUnicorn
<RobertRevenge> cachi01: I downloaded it, but I haven't run it yet.
<owloysius> unicorn
<Obsidian> Dat unicore
<Obsidian> *unicorn
<potato_pony> uh oh
<cachi01> RobertRevenge: then upload it to mediafire again!
<Allegr0> but for cereal, can somepony educate me on what's confusing my eye holes?
<Cypresswolf> Unicorn Dragon? Unigon...Dragacorn...?
<StinkomanFan> Damnit Satan
<Nyst> Gah, buffering.
<Cypresswolf> Evicted "D
<Cypresswolf> :D
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: It's not Satan =P
<Dken2021> is this where it get's weird?
<[wub]ehren> too bad.
<Kandarihu> Vordox, yes it is. He came in the form of a snake.
<Celes_Chere> snake =/= Satan
<Nyst> Whoa, really bad buffering.
<Vordox> Kandarihu: No
<Vordox> Kandarihu: How can something exist before he was created?
<Obsidian> RIP the last unicorn
<Cypresswolf> I thought it was Noah who forgot the Unicorn
<Nyst> And again buffering. I wonder if something went wrong with my connection.
<Allegr0> mmm, dat midi
<Fou_Lou> nyst i have bad stream too
<Nyst> The Adam & Eve bit suddenly ended and they're back on the boat?
<JESmith71> They'll get back to Adam and Eve later
<Cypresswolf> Save the frog :D
<Kandarihu> Satan existed before the universe was created. He started out as Lucifer, an angel who rebelled against God and tried to form an army of 1/3 of all the angels. God cast Lucifer and his army out of heaven. Lucifer became Satan and the angels became demons. This was before God created the universe.
<Fou_Lou> Nyst: twain told them kids the story with the book on the boat
<Nyst> Fou_Lou: does the sound hang for you too?
<Chains> Well, that's just silly!
<StinkomanFan> PULL THE OTHER ONE
<Fou_Lou> Nyst i have buffering sometimes and "bad fps" more often.
<Chains> Stupid woman
<Vordox> But heaven is supposed to be on earth? :)
<Kandarihu> Vordox, no.
<Vordox> I find that very funny...
<Nyst> So does that imply heaven is extradimentional?
<Vordox> There's so many holes in it from all the stories.
<StinkomanFan> Vordox, If Santa isn't on Earth, neither is heaven.
<Meanwhile> Santa?
<Vordox> Firstly: Angels before humans? What is the purpose of Adam and Eve if the humanity has yet not become angels thereby bucking it up itself? :P
<Kandarihu> Oh, I thought this was a sea-vessel. Is it an airship now?
<Dken2021> don't cha know? santa is satan
<Vordox> Meh, dat religion.
<Chains> I genuinely have no idea at all what is going on
<Nyst> It's always been an airship.
<Celes_Chere> Vordox: I blame the repeated retranslations over thousands of years >_<
<Fou_Lou> Kandarihu: was an airship all the time
<Kandarihu> Fou_Lou, okay.
<Vordox> Celes: Which version? choose between 1-1000000
<JESmith71> And this version of Adam and Eve is Twain's version from his book Letters From the Earth
<Meanwhile> No religious debate in chat.
<Nyst> Well whatever it is, we know it's nowwhere we can see, and that noone has ever returned from it.
<Chains> BUFFER
<Nyst> *nowhere
<Fou_Lou> Celes_Chere: not to mention it was written by man anyway after hundreds of years goin from mouth to mouth
<Dawg_Major> O_O
<Dken2021> so he's in his story?
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, as long as it's civil, there's no problem with it.
<DocSane> Vordox: I don't hink humans CAN become angels.
<Chains> I agree with them. WHAT'S GOING ON?
<owloysius> hahahaha
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: It never stays civil. Ever.
<Fou_Lou> Nyst: so no reason to think it actually exists
<DocSane> Vordox: I think they're supposed to fulfill two entirely different roles in creation.
