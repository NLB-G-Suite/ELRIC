<Punkie_Pue> like cheezy bacon fries?
<Polydunami> Similar to gravy
<Vordox> <---- Paranoi much
<Kencolt> Polydunami: Actually, it's Fries plus Cheese Curds plus Gravy.
<Polydunami> Yeah, I just looked it up
<Punkie_Pue> that sounds amazing!
<Polydunami> It's a good combination
<djxana> just give kim jun un enough time and he'll bomb china
<djxana> n korea is the real nuke power

<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I'm calling it now, we're gonna end up blowing everyone up oen of these days
<Vordox> Canadian Apple Nuke

<Kandarihu> Polydunami, I wholeheartedly agree.
<wipergone2> sub06905: lol
<Kandarihu> By the way, this forced me away from Space Pirates and Zombies.

<Vordox> Wrek: Normal Day? :P

<AJIsAwesome> Yes, Saturn?

<Saturn> 08,01it's the title of a tlak i'm writing
<Saturn> 08,01*talk
<VenHur> Wrek: [facepalm] Ohhh...
<Punkie_Pue> Sounds like a good title to me.
<Kandarihu> Saturn, hmm... I'm leaning towards "good"
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<VenHur> ...Never heard of that Saturn...
<twilight_sprinkl|afk> Saturn: sounds good to me personally
<Wrek> 05oh saturn

<Kandarihu> NocturnalBlade, that's no more the real Mitt Romney than the outsourcing monster that the MSM painted him as.
<AJIsAwesome> djxana: Nope, but Sweetie's sister was Cheerilee in G3.
<Saturn> 08,01cheers y'all

<NocturnalBlade> well that done happened 6_9
<Kandarihu> VenHur, I can't imagine someone enjoying this without being drunk or worse.
<djxana> it seams like the same jokes as i find in adult swims live action programs
<Wrek> 05ok wtf is this shit
<Polydunami> Now you're getting close
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Even Wrek questions this
<VenHur> Wrek: It's madness...
<Kandarihu> Oh, all of a sudden, the guy's screaming made me laugh.
<NocturnalBlade> Lol Thursday's forcast was nuke
<NocturnalBlade> daaaaaaw <3

<AssaultWithEmbraces> bye VenHur
<VenHur> Wrek: Yes, my tacos needs me...They need me to glues the canyon back together...
<Polydunami> No, you've got the right idea, djxana
<Kandarihu> djxana, according to TV Tropes, it's supposed to be nonsensical.
<Kencolt> djxana: I don't think so... I think I just figured it out. This isn't really very funny. It's just pointlessly random.
<Wrek> 05the V in view
<VenHur> Wrek: ...Yeah...that one canyon...the one with a million of old ET cartridges...Welp, I must go now.
<Wrek> 05represents their vagina

<Kencolt> At least... I'm not laughing. I'm gone for now.
*Kencolt waves
<Polydunami> See you, Kencolt
<wipergone2> lol
<djxana> it's more tollerable than childrens hospital or ntsf sd suv
<Polydunami> dat carousel music from Super Mario 64
<NocturnalBlade> bye ken
<AssaultWithEmbraces> And now for something completely different
<Kandarihu> Is there a way to send notes to users who are gone?
<wipergone2> cocaine
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Kandarihu, yes. As long as they're still on the network
<CCharmanderK> We doin' requests?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Spy, calm down.
<Polydunami> These guys should not be making those faces
<Kandarihu> AssaultWithEmbraces, I meant a note system, where I leave a note for someone who left the network that they will see when they come back.
<CCharmanderK> COCAINUM
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Kandarihu: I don't think so
<Polydunami> Cocainium? What the hell?
<CCharmanderK> We ARE doing requests, right?
<Vordox> Roboda?
<NocturnalBlade> dat Goron music ^_^
<NocturnalBlade> dont think so CCharmanderK
<CCharmanderK> Damn.
<Polydunami> Seems unlikely
<Wrek> 05yeah i rarely take requests
<CCharmanderK> Poor Heavy.
<CCharmanderK> XD
<CCharmanderK> ScoutNavi
<NocturnalBlade> aaaand that was loud XD
<Kandarihu> You know what? It doesn't matter. I wanted to tell Kencolt that Wrek got off of the Dayjob Orchestra and onto Source videos right after he left. But it was the RED Team doing Cocaine.
<Polydunami> Now that was kind of not there
<CCharmanderK> Noisy TESTICLES?!!
<NocturnalBlade> ^
<Polydunami> That beginning Shh reminded me of the Gracie Films logo
<Barbetos> Yeah.
<Barbetos> Don't your testicles make noise?
<Yahooz> sup, snitches
<Polydunami> Hey there, Yahooz
<Barbetos> You might want to have it checked out if they dont.
<thelonepony> i'm back
<CCharmanderK> Yoohoo, Yahooz.
<Barbetos> It can be a sign of a serious condition.
<Yahooz> i heard there was a little drama earlier
<Barbetos> Drama? Bronystate?
<Polydunami> Yeesh, I remember that
<thelonepony> wait, what?
<Barbetos> When does that ever happen?
<CCharmanderK> If there was, I wasn't here for it.
<Wrek> 05this guys pretty good
<Yahooz> Barbetos: all the god damn time
<thelonepony> what did i miss?
<Polydunami> I was there when it happened, actually
<emangamer> oh god you guys
<Yahooz> oh fuck its emangamer XD
<CCharmanderK> Yeah, since when does Bronystate have any drama? >_>
<Barbetos> Just noticed it was one hand
<Wrek> 05no?
<emangamer> oh fuck it's Yahooz, hide the pronz
<Barbetos> That impressive
<Drew> one arm? D:
<Kandarihu> So, is his left hand paralyzed or something? Or does he have some aspiration that requires his left hand to be free?
<Barbetos> I bet he is popular with the ladies.
<Wrek> 05he broke it
<CCharmanderK> This man must have some kick-ass masturbation sessions.
<Drew> -.-
<CCharmanderK> What?

<Barbetos> >RD decides to be like a sister for scoots.
<Kandarihu> Tom is part of Ponychat
<Barbetos> >Leaves to Wonderbolt Academy the next day
<pony_9070> Tom is a Network Service.

<Barbetos> Rainbow horse is best horse.
<Yahooz> *network
<Wrek> 05now

<Tom> Episode 7 of season 3 "Wonderbolt Academy" airs in 5 days, 9 hours, 21 minutes, 34 seconds (Dec 15 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<Kandarihu> Barbetos, I have a theory about the next episode that makes more sense, but if I'm right, it would be a spoiler.
<Barbetos> I'd never tell.
<Yahooz> or not
<gunthler> I know what you can do.
<gunthler> Set Fantasy
<gunthler> Off.
<gunthler> Via ChanServ
<emangamer> Yahooz: did you?????
<Barbetos> Eh.
<Yahooz> emangamer: yeah, a while back
<Yahooz> like, a year ago-ish
<Barbetos> I dun really care for theories or anything at this point.
<Polydunami> In any case, I'm quite okay with keeping a lid on the talk about future episodes.
<Barbetos> I just can't wait for more pony
<gunthler> Wrek
<Wrek> 05doesnt matter
<Wrek> 05theres a no talk rule in effect
<Wrek> 05about unaired eps
<Wrek> 05you dont have to be ok or not ok with it
<Wrek> 05its not happenign anyways
<Wrek> 05and if it does
<Wrek> 05its hamemr time
<emangamer> Yahooz: I wrote a program to read the entire of FO:E, create a table of each word and how many times it's been used, delete the words smaller than 4 letters, then create a word cloud from the most used words
<emangamer> it's taking FOREVER
<Ryunosuke> hamemr time?
<Ryunosuke> :)
<gunthler> Who has the +s Chan Flag, Wrek?
<Polydunami> Well then, thanks for the info
<Yahooz> gunthler: Saturn I believe
<Yahooz> rather, he has +f
<Yahooz> so that works just as well
<Kandarihu> All we really know is the title, and nothing else. Let's just keep it that way so we can all enjoy it.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
*gunthler pokes Saturn
<Yahooz> niqqa he sleepin
<gunthler> ah well.
<Kandarihu> Alien "Critters", in Space Pirates and Zombies, the goons who get turned into zombies are called critters. I think the word zombie in that game only apply to the ships.
<gunthler> /cs SET #bronystate FANTASY OFF
<gunthler> That'll do the trick.
<Yahooz> ./cs never works on my client...
<thelonepony> http://i.imgur.com/i6Z0Q.png ;3;
<Drew> Obamas not an alien...or is he?
<Kandarihu> Drew, his values are alien to the founding principles, but he's an Earthling, and most likely born in Hawaii.
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: what happen when i left anyway?
<Drew> phew
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: Nothing much. :)
<Polydunami> Sharks have small brains, you see. All they know what to do is to swim, sense their prey, and eat it
<thelonepony> ah
<Polydunami> Oh, and make new sharks
<djxana> i'm going by by
<Polydunami> See you, djxana
<thelonepony> but he wants to cuddle ;3;
<gunthler> The better solution would be ' /query ChanServ '
<Yahooz> i liek /msg
<Kandarihu> Polydunami, they can also learn that humans don't taste as good as seals, but they can only do so the hard way.
<thelonepony> well i got to go
<thelonepony> bye everyone :)
<Polydunami> That's true
<gunthler> In that case: ' /msg ChanServ SET #bronystate FANTASY OFF '
<gunthler> would work.
<Polydunami> Also, humans can be resilient creatures when they know what to do
<Yahooz> provided they want to turn off Tom
<gunthler> yeah.
<gunthler> it get's rid of all ! commands
<gunthler> for the specified channel
<Wrek> 05gusy a good drummer
<Yahooz> duh
<Polydunami> Whoa

<Afflict> Looks like someone was/is making a spyro game that's supposed to be released on the 21st
<Afflict> The last post in the thread was last year though, and the thread's locked
<emangamer> Yahooz: I'm still waiting for my code to read FO:E XD

<Kandarihu> RaveBrony, agreed.
<ponystuff> was just watching a video on a gang before I came here....strange
<MirrorImage> "What will you do if someone offers you drugs?" "Oh why thank you!"
<pony_5545> drugs are very expensive now a days if someone offers em ill take it
<RaveBrony> Thats a shame
<pony_2143> those are old numbers

<Kimori> aw missed em..
<MirrorImage> The Curse of Groupthink.
<pony_2143> I bet religion is the source of all things evil :)
<RaveBrony> Woah
<KrazyNoobs> pony_2143 :)
<Shizuka> 13religion itself? no
<MirrorImage> ...i'm tempted to make a comment about that and republicans...
<Kandarihu> pony_2143, this is back when he was a lot more bigoted against Christians than he is now.
<MirrorImage> but lets not start that
<Shizuka> 13people that take it too seriously? absolutely
<RaveBrony> ^
<KrazyNoobs> Here we go, arguing about religion again... idiots...
<Wrek> 05KrazyNoobs: no not really
<Shizuka> 13now shut up and take a hit of this muffin
<Wrek> 05cause I dont allow it
<KrazyNoobs> Wrek :D
<pony_2143> We listening to people dropping the "F" bomb and people worried about me calling religion evil?
<MirrorImage> pony_2143 - swearing is one thing. Religion and Politics just breeds flame wars
<KrazyNoobs> It is always good to have an admin controlling things... yesterday, a huge argument of religion broke out among this chatroom, and there were no admins.
<KrazyNoobs> It got really stupid.
<SpeccyRush> speaking of TLJ... shown Volcano yet? I know, I do ask a lot
<Shizuka> 13not yet
<SpeccyRush> Shizuka: ^
<MirrorImage> "You're Wrong!" "No You're Wrong"; 20 goto 10
<pony_2143> Yah so stop believing in religion
<FBI_agent> HELLO
<RaveBrony> I had to debate in front of 3 classes Against my ex whether they should legalize weed or not (I was against legalization)
<MakerDusk> KrazyNoobs: there's always an admin if you know where to look :p
<SpeccyRush> ok thanks Shizuka
<Wrek> 05no really
<KrazyNoobs> pony_2143 Although you are smart, keep those views to yourself. That is likely to cause an outbreak of argument
<Shizuka> 13< a good portion of my friends smoked
<Wrek> 05profanity isnt a problem here
<emangamer> Shizuka: you should know better than to use performance enhancing muffins
<Wrek> 05but starting flamewars over politics and religion
<Wrek> 05is a problem
<Wrek> 05better drop it now
<FBI_agent> i agree
<Buytoast> oh, Bullshit?
<Buytoast> what's it goin on this time?
<Shizuka> 13NOOOO DON'T BAN THE DONUTS
<RaveBrony> O_O
<FBI_agent> lol
<Kandarihu> I make it a point to try not to flame people under any circumstances. Would it be a flamewar if only one side is flaming the other side?
<MakerDusk> vietnam has internet...
<MirrorImage> Kandarihu - nah, that's a Flamethrower
<Buytoast> i'm guessing it's about drugs?
<FBI_agent> MakerDusk ?

<Kandarihu> So now he's arguing that drugs are safe?
<MirrorImage> and in Russia, the top 3 causes of accidents are "All of the Above"
<Shizuka> 13uh... penn.. normally i love ya but...
<Shizuka> 13those top three causes, are the primary factors that caused the crash... but what caused *them*
<FBI_agent> man here theres no top causes, you just get hit lol
<MirrorImage> "All of the Above"
<Shizuka> 13unsafe speed isn't the root cause, something caused you to travel at the unsafe speed
<MirrorImage> ...wow, you'd never get away with a commercial like that
<MirrorImage> not today anyways
<Shizuka> 13which one the "this is your brain on drugs" or the pothead pulling up to the drivethru?
<Shizuka> 13that latter one was on at least in the late 90s i think
<MirrorImage> and you've seen the difference between 90s and 00s television
<Shizuka> 13true
<Kandarihu> Yeah, his reasoning isn't always spot on. This isn't even worth him having the last word on it.
<MirrorImage> the drivethru is what i was referring to, regardless
<MirrorImage> dat pot leaf desklamp

<Kandarihu> The difference between drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, is that I don't become a secondhand drinker when people drink alcohol.
<Kandarihu> around me

<Shizuka> 13it just comes across as immature
<KrazyNoobs> R

<geeky> oh gwad
<KrazyNoobs> I, myself, don't swear that much.
<KrazyNoobs> It's all about class.
<otakon> They just want a conviction
<KrazyNoobs> seems legit
<Sumica> 00,10keep it reasonable Punkie_Pue
<otakon> they don't give a damn if it's the ACTUAL PERSON
<Drew> nooo

<KrazyNoobs> lol
<Yukikaze> This sounds like a Chappelle joke.

<otakon> BUT HOW?!
<KrazyNoobs> The profanity takes all the seriousness out of this, lol
<geeky> ugg
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol Penn probably had to put a week check in the swear jar

<otakon> God that poor man
<Drew> He better have got money from that shit!
<otakon> and i bet you

<Sumica> 00,10I hope some fuckers swung over that one
<geeky> KrazyNoobs: ok =3
<otakon> I BET YOU they didn't give him ANY restitution over it
<Sumica> 00,10this guy better be set for life
<Punkie_Pue> How does that work?
<MirrorImage> Sumica - unfortunately, the people responsible were probably already retired
<otakon> it didn't work
<Kandarihu> I saw a documentary about prison life. The worst thing about innocent people going to prison is that they have to adapt to a prison culture that will either harden them into potentially violent criminals who cannot live outside of prison, or it will kill them.
<otakon> IT FUCKING FAILED
<MirrorImage> though as i recall, he got something to the tune of 700k/year he was in
<Drew> so much of his life wasted...
<Sumica> 00,10wrongfull imprisonment.
<KrazyNoobs> Kandarihu was it by Louis T?

<KrazyNoobs> Moopy two words: AD, and BLOCK
<Moopy> ok ok i get it

<KrazyNoobs> I'm da health inspector.
<Punkie_Pue> Up to 10
<Sumica> 00,10you forgot the +
<otakon> AdBlock+
<Ryunosuke> OBJECTION!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> sigh its stuff like THIS that makes me wish i lived in Equestria :S
<geeky> KrazyNoobs: seams legit
<otakon> good stuff
<otakon> Sketch_Toku_Brony: agreed
<KrazyNoobs> You have to wash behind your ears, man.
<KrazyNoobs> Thass hygiene, -----
<Sumica> 00,10man that must have sucked
<KrazyNoobs> Gawd, that was funny
<Sumica> 00,10not only wrongfully imprisioned but no pain meds wither
<Kandarihu> Actually, the example shown wasn't an innocent person, but a young rapist. But a wrongfully accused and convicted person would have to put up with the same culture.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> otakon: yeah at least Celestia and Luna arent like these idiots :D
<Punkie_Pue> Equestria is a monachy. Im sure they have problems. :)
<Drew> Did he get his meds in jail? it would suck if he didnt
<Sumica> 00,10well one positve for him
<KrazyNoobs> Who here has seen that Prison Shower scene from Boondocks?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Punkie_Pue: huh good point but it might better there than here :D
<MirrorImage> he probably got "some" meds
<Sumica> 00,10hard to rape a man whos sitting down
<MirrorImage> i think he was in jail because he had a stockpile
<Punkie_Pue> Certainly.
<MirrorImage> not because of how much he was taking
<Ryunosuke> that teller
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Sumica: :O It was the CHAIR!
<sub06905> Sumica: :D
<geeky> lol
<geeky> Sumica: wut
<KrazyNoobs> Sumica I would just scoot over to the soap, and pick it up with my mouth. Still get r---- by ----- anyway... Prison logic
<KrazyNoobs> Sumica while sitting
<Drew> He could have been obama :(
<Moopy> damn teller
<geeky> um

<otakon> Punkie_Pue: you are NOT sending murderers to Luna :|

<KrazyNoobs> Hi Jmo

<Petrified_Discord> Devil's advocate: it's far cheaper to kill a prisoner than to imprison them
<otakon> but a bastard taht PROVES he CANNONT LIVE WITH OTHERS PEACEFULLY
<otakon> needs to die
<KrazyNoobs> Be right back. Mail

<Petrified_Discord> Funfact: when crucified, you die from suffocation first
<otakon> Guillotine
<Punkie_Pue> haha i follow a simmilar diet
<Yukikaze> guillotine seems much more quick and humane
<RaveBrony> Dat diet, hahah
<otakon> "Heavy enough to snap my neck diet"
<Poom> Yukikaze, how so?
<geeky> posion
<otakon> Yukikaze: some times it missed... or it didn't go through all the way
<Wrek> 05the guilliotine is actually one of the quickest and least painful execution methods
<Kandarihu> Drew, I clicked on the link again now and it's letting me vote again. Ballot-stuffing is wrong. If MLP FiM gets taken off the list for this, I wouldn't be surprised.
<Punkie_Pue> like an alca aeltzer lol
<Artifact> She <3 her job to much i think..
<KrazyNoobs> The head stays alive for 30 seconds
<Wrek> 05why do you think we use a piston to the brain as a method to kill farm animals?

<Drew> Kandarihu: Yeah, it's pretty obvious that a lot of people are.
<otakon> lethal injection
<Poom> Wrek, when you say 'we' you mean overseas or America.
<geeky> i think im going to hell
<Petrified_Discord> I like the episode where they talk about how removal of the heart couldn't be used to kill prisoners because a doctor would have to do it and...you know...hippocratic oath and all
<Artifact> geeky: what a concentration camp,or that museum
<geeky> Artifact: the museume
<Mutterdude> hi all >.>
<RaveBrony> Lolwut
<otakon> and then THIS
<Petrified_Discord> Actually, not sure if that's penn&teller or not...
<Punkie_Pue> I think being killed with mophine would be the most humane
<Sui_Generis> Awww shit, it's a mime
<geeky> hu Mutterdude
<Punkie_Pue> morphine
<Yukikaze> every other method of execution has a possiblily of failure
<Artifact> I'm thinking of toy story right now
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> mimes...the WORST kind of execution
<Kandarihu> Drew, this is the next great brony moral breakdown since the Fighting is Magic leak.
<Petrified_Discord> Death by mime
<otakon> no call
<geeky> lol
<Sui_Generis> electrocution is a horrible way to die
<Buytoast> You've got needles in me, you've got needles in me.
<KrazyNoobs> dat mime face at the end
<RaveBrony> Hahaha

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ALL ponies are all adorably equal :) except Tiara :D
<Goldframe> period

<Petrified_Discord> Cannot be avoided
<RaveBrony> Very true
<Petrified_Discord> Don't even try
<Artifact> I do not like babs
<KrazyNoobs> Artifact Rarity has good character development, I didn't like her too much in the first few episodes of Season 1, now I like her alot more. She is number 3 on my list
<geeky> Kandarihu: no in erupe that was difrent that had jews and other relgons
<CTHULHU> All ponies are best ponies. :)
<AppleBloom> Artifact: why not?
<Drew> I feel bad for babs..
<Punkie_Pue> why didn't babs go camping with the cmc?
<Wrek> 05she was back in manehatten
<Kandarihu> geeky, it was still wrong.
<Goldframe> because she's a city gal?
<RaveBrony> Yeah, she went back to the city

<KrazyNoobs> Lives in ManeHatten, but has more of a Boston accent. Pony logic?
<geeky> *girls
<Artifact> AppleBloom: Well, I geuss its because I don't like episodes that focus on bullying
<Yukikaze> isn't Penn an athiest?
<Punkie_Pue> I thought it was more a bronx accent.
<Drew> Babs seed is one of my favorites
<KrazyNoobs> Dat song in S3E4
<Artifact> Raritys the best pony
<Kandarihu> Yukikaze, yes he is.
<RaveBrony> No such thing as best pony, lol
<AppleBloom> Artifact: well it is a kid show, and that being the case bullying would be in there at one point or another
<geeky> RaveBrony: i agree
<Artifact> AppleBloom: but the song in that episode is awesome
<Buytoast> only yellow quiet is the greatest
<KrazyNoobs> Imagine how long the wait will be for Season 4... I'm estimating 9 - 11 months... :(
<Buytoast> and that demon horse is terrible

<KrazyNoobs> ... ... ... que?
<KrazyNoobs> what?
<Kandarihu> Oh, yeah, Black Lagoon. I have a bit of a confession to make. When Wrek started streaming this, I was honorbanned. But I still watched the stream. What's worse is that I honorbanned myself because Wrek himself kicked me for discussing an upcoming episode.
<Sumica> 00,10still have not goten MPC working wrek?
<Goldframe> he had to set up the dubbed audio
<Wrek> 05Sumica: nah im usign the built in

<otakon> hell no
<Goldframe> the twins
*Goldframe shudders
<Kandarihu> A few days later, I honorban myself again around the beginning of BMN, and I handle it properly, banning myself from the stream too.
<AppleBloom> anyone think they're going to have a CMC episode based in the future of their lives?
<Artifact> The only thing 4kids is good at is the original Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon
<RaveBrony> Lol
<RaveBrony> ._.
<Kandarihu> So, I think I'm caught up with this, but only because I committed an honorary network offense.
<otakon> yeah idiot
<Wrek> 05hai gilda
<Petrified_Discord> He died as he lived...typing.
<Sui_Generis> Yay, shaving commercial
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> honorary offense, how does that work
<Goldframe> Revy is best drunkard
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Wrek thanks now everytime i see Gilda,im gonna hear drop the F bomb everytime she on screen :D
<Artifact> Actually Revy sounds like someone from the walking dead game..
<RaveBrony> Oh snap
<otakon> Damn
<AppleBloom> Artifact: how is the walking dead game?
<RaveBrony> Lolwut
<AppleBloom> as i walk through the shadows in the valley of death... I would bring a flashlight
<Artifact> AppleBloom: Its a heart wrenching story that would put any man to tears
<SpeccyRush> nun with a gun
<Goldframe> for those who haven't seen the series....Buy it!
<Kandarihu> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, the way I meant it to work is that a real ban is only from the IRC, but an honorban applies to all of Bronystate-related services. IRC, stream, and outside contact with members of the community.
<RaveBrony> Hah
<Goldframe> It is one of the best series ever made
<Artifact> Nun is the best gun weilder
<RoboGerbil> lol closed church

<AdamTheDuck> Dem teeth o.o
<RoboGerbil> doomed!
<Artifact> It be funny if the goldeneye gun glitch happened
<Artifact> y'know when they all dance

<Artifact> Mutterguy: I think its the stuf at the end
<AppleBloom> theone thing one all of their minds are, Im going to kill her
<Sui_Generis> 1000 years later*
<Artifact> Mutterguy: o the bible
<Artifact> *of
<RaveBrony> Hah
<Kandarihu> Mutterguy, it's where a pastor starts preaching according to something other than the word of God. Like philosophers or something.
<otakon> they're both fake
<Artifact> TE BOTH THE FAKIES
<Kandarihu> Come to think of it, that's what the Catholic church was doing when Martin Luther rebelled and founded the Protestant church.
<RaveBrony> Hahahaha
<Artifact> the reformation Kandarihu
<Kandarihu> Artifact, yes
<RaveBrony> :L
<Sui_Generis> No one ever listens when it comes to anachy
<AppleBloom> isnt oprah off the air?
<Artifact> Lol
<Goldframe> god I love revy
<Artifact> AppleBloom: yes
<Goldframe> Oprah was still on air when the dub was made
<Drew> Oprah got trolled pretty badly :)
<RaveBrony> God wants more money
<Sui_Generis> OWN
<Kandarihu> Luke 16:??
<Artifact> Gods just in it for the moniez
<Drew> They found a plannet made out of diamonds :D
<Sui_Generis> Thats for Catholic church, Artifact
<Polydunami|Busy> I was missing Black Lagoon? Dang
<Polydunami> So what is the occasion?
<Artifact> Im a planet made out of diamonds
<pony_9193> Florida is not Texas
<pony_9193> Bad Japan
<Petrified_Discord> Floridian cowboy. Seems legit.
<otakon> suddenly cowboy?
<RoboGerbil> that guy aint from florida
<otakon> ooooooooookay
<Sui_Generis> From florida, looks like a cowboy, perfect logic
<Artifact> Hey its the guy from the extra turnabout in the ds Ace attourney
<Polydunami> We didn't change that fact, you guys.
<pony_9193> All americans are cowboys
<RoboGerbil> might believe luisiana
<Goldframe> he's a gator wrangler
<Kandarihu> pony_9193, not all Americans... sadly.
<Artifact> pony_9193: all texans are cowboys
<Polydunami> So who exactly is streaming this show?
<Artifact> Edda means me
<AdamTheDuck> Polydunami, Wrek is.
<Polydunami> ...

<Drew> diamonds! http://www.spacetoday.org/DeepSpace/Stars/WhiteDwarfs/LucyDiamondStarWhiteDwarf.html
<AdamTheDuck> Polydunami, still? How long has he been streaming?
<Polydunami> All night, evidently

<Petrified_Discord> Fukken cows back on the range...in Florida
<Artifact> I know what that is...
<Goldframe> I love how they kept Shen Hua's engrish
<Kandarihu> In my opinion, any American who truely wishes to be free is a cowboy to one extent or another. Too many Americans just want more government and less freedom.
<otakon> lol
<RaveBrony> O_o

<Kandarihu> Polydunami, it is.
<Wrek> 05as in it has all the bases and all presets needed

<Wrek> 05aswell as balancing
<AppleBloom> good night everypony, havea awesome day tomorrow, or today depending on your time zone

<Yukikaze> I didn't see the map very well. Was there any destructible rocks?
<Wrek> 05not designed with those in mind
<Wrek> 05might block of 4th or 5th bases with them
<Polydunami> Right, just went off air
<sub06905> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXHMPpPjVr4
<sub06905> :>
<Yukikaze> So basically a fast paced map at this point
<Polydunami> No.
<Wrek> 05yes albeit large
<KrazyNoobs> Yay, slideshow.
<Artifact> Montage time
<Polydunami> Gmod voices really really bug me.
<Artifact> LUNA
<Wrek> 05heres a screenshot
<KrazyNoobs> dat twilight "a"
<Artifact> I like symphony better then Octavia and vinyl
<Polydunami> Who?
<Drew> Hacker https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-8sxEVsTq0&feature=plcp
<Wrek> 05though Yukikaze I jsut finished shapign and texturign the main island
<Artifact> Shes sorta like octavia
<Artifact> and looks cooler
<CTHULHU> D'awwww.
<Polydunami> If she's an OC, then I don't really give much of a damn
<Polydunami> Okay, back online
<Wrek> 05here you go Yukikaze: http://i.imgur.com/Prt5v.jpg
<Moopy> Hey i have a question for minecraft for the xbox: for the dispencer and put a couple gun powder in it can a creeper pop out of the dispencer?
<CTHULHU> Polydunami: what's so bad about OC's?
<pony_9193> The dub of Black Lagoon isn't all that bad.
<Polydunami> I enjoy this show
<Polydunami> I never said OCs were bad, CTHULHU
<Wrek> 05the dub featuers many MLP voices
<Goldframe> Actually saw MELL in concert when she was in the states a few years ago
<SpeccyRush> Tabitha being one
<Polydunami> What I mean is that Octavia appeared in the show but I don't remember this Symphony at all
<Polydunami> Black Lagoon has a badass opening
<Kandarihu> Really? Who does Tabitha play?
<SpeccyRush> Tabithat is the dub voice of the maid right Wrek ?
<Wrek> 05yes
<SpeccyRush> *Tabitha
<Polydunami> Oh, I know the maid character
<Artifact> Polydunami: no shes not http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/File:Violin_pony_s02e09.png
<Polydunami> Oh
<Polydunami> Well, then
<Polydunami> I do like her design, that's for sure
<Goldframe> Ashleigh was hansel
<Yukikaze> wrek: from the north and south mineral points is there a way to reach the main?
<Polydunami> I do like her design, that's for sure
<Sumica> 00,10that guy sounds just like Setsuna F seyay
<Sumica> 00,10only happyer
<Wrek> 05Yukikaze: tehres a reaper/blinker-observer reach
<Wrek> 05but not a ramp
<Yukikaze> so zerg has to work to make any attemps work
<Goldframe> Sumica: It is the same guy
<a_snake> PANTSU
<KrazyNoobs> ew
<Wrek> 05luckily my main map tester maisn masters zerg :)
<Artifact> Its a flawless plan
<Goldframe> http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6832 for those who were wondering who voiced what character in the dub
<Polydunami> Cathy Weseluck voices a character in this anime
<Yukikaze> Wrek: would mass zergling or roach bust through to reach natural?
<a_snake> LOL
<a_snake> this show is amazing
<Goldframe> in the first season she voiced Garcia
<a_snake> more pantsu
<Polydunami> Yep
<SirGanjalf> 4/7, nice
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hi
<Kandarihu> It worked! LOL
<Goldframe> yeah...the only mlp va that you'll hear in the second barrage is Ashleigh
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai aniderp|bestcakeever
<Artifact> hey ashleigh ball
<Sumica> 00,10ah and the girls voice
<Wrek> 05the main has 1 ramp to the natural, that has 1 ramp to the major battlefield.
<KrazyNoobs> celery
<aniderp|bestcakeever> dat jaymoo on?
<Polydunami> Speaking of Cathy Weseluck, we should watch CyberSix sometime
<KrazyNoobs> CELERY!!!
<Buytoast> must confess, this show is pissing me off
<Wrek> 05the map is pretty open with only 2 real chokes
<Wrek> 05being main base
<Artifact> APPLEJACK WHATA YOU DOING IN BLACK LAGON
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, really? You?
<Moopy> she sounds like applejack
<Buytoast> can't stand people like these ones
<Drew> ugh, heart burn to the max! :(
<Polydunami> Ashleigh Ball does voice a couple of characters in this show
<a_snake> Applejack best getaway driver
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, okay, I understand.
<a_snake> SO ASIAN
<Artifact> Moopy: She does the voice to some charcters and i just noticed
<Moopy> ikr
<a_snake> WTF is with Florida cowboys
<Kandarihu> Yeah, this show pretty much runs on Black and Grey morality.
<Yukikaze> good map..... I have to see test plays of this. From the way it looks Zerg is going to have a hard time, but I don't play SC2 that much.
<Moopy> holy shit this chick could be like pinkamena
<Polydunami> Ahaha, Tabitha voices a maid who takes care of a boy voiced by Cathy Weseluck
<Wrek> 05Yukikaze: im hopign the openess of the main area and the close 3rd evens it otu a bit
<Goldframe> poly, that would be Garcia
<Artifact> RAINBOW DASH WATTA YOU DOING IN BLACK LAGON
<Polydunami> Yeah, Garcia. And the maid is Roberta
<Goldframe> I'm still waiting for the R1 release of Roberta's Blood Trail
<Wrek> 05i cant say untill it gets playtested
<Polydunami> I have not seen this anime for a while
<Wrek> 05then i can adjust accordingly
<Goldframe> Saw the first episode at Anime Expo when it was announced
<Wrek> 05the cake(map) is fresh out of the oven and needs some frosting and sprinkles (balancing) ;)
<Wrek> 05<3
<Goldframe> all I have to say to that is....Yey blood
<Yukikaze> Wrek: what about a mass muta?
<Artifact> <_<:D <=Get out o here
<Artifact> *of
<a_snake> This is how haxoring actually works
<xles> Wrek: Frosting? Just put it outside, and before you know it I'm sure it'll be.... Iced...
<Polydunami> Ashleigh Ball? She'd not the voice of Revy you know
<Polydunami> *she's
<Wrek> 05map has yet to be tested, massing mutas should work fairly normally
<Buytoast> all you gotta do is make banelings
<Buytoast> 400 banelings and you can't be stopped
<Goldframe> revy is Gilda / Spits
<Yukikaze> Nevermind muta will probably be melted by marines or stalker
<Wrek> 05thats subjective to the map design though
<Artifact> Polydunami: I know but shes voiced some characters in the show
<Polydunami> That much, I know
<Artifact> I just realised eric stuart voiced pegasus,james and brock
<Polydunami> Just, not until tonight
*Goldframe points to the link that he had posted earlier
<Wrek> 05brb gettign some quick breakfast
<Wrek> 05also awesome minigun is awesome
<Goldframe> and on that note, I'm going to flee for the night

<Jmo> Dafuq Phase.
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: you shoulnd't be able to do that
<Saturn> 08,01but i don't have time to fix that now

<Kandarihu> Artifact, what if the Strawhat Pirates encountered the Lagoon Company?
<Mutterguy> *one
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well i have enough time to make popcorn then
<Polydunami> For starters, Luffy can absorb bullets
<Sumica> 00,10some how I think PT boat beats galion
<Artifact> Kandarihu: Get it because twi, ben and bubbles are voiced by the same person
<Mutterguy> Sumica no if galleon manages to hit with the broadside
<Kandarihu> Polydunami, true. But would Revy manifest haki?
<Sumica> 00,10keey words
<Yukikaze> Which straw hat ship are we talking about?
<Polydunami> Kandarihu, that would make for an interesting crossover, you know. One Piece: Black Lagoon

<Artifact> CTHULHU: Well there not pigs, so there would/nt be canbalistic ponys everywhere,...

<Saturn> 08,01hi KrazyNoobs
<CTHULHU> KrazyNoobs: really?
<Cypresswolf> Im psyced about this friday - not sure if watch movie night or Hobbit in theatre :)
<Saturn> 08,01unfortunately, i can't stream for you; i have an exam tomorrow and am deep in studying
<KrazyNoobs> Cypresswolf: Always choose ponies
<Meanwhile> >deep in studying
<Meanwhile> >on chat
<Meanwhile> >logic.
<Saturn> 08,01(taking a break at the moment, obviously)
<KrazyNoobs> Saturn: That's okay
<Cypresswolf> KrazyNoobs: You're Right! There ARE ponies in the Hobbit ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01must not kickban Meanwhile... must not kickban Meanwhile...
<KrazyNoobs> Cypresswolf: Then go and watch it! :D
<Meanwhile> Go back to studying Saturn. :P
<KrazyNoobs> Da hayall?
<CTHULHU> It's sometime good to be a NEET.
<Meanwhile> Hehehe.
<Saturn> 08,01OOOO, MAIL
<KrazyNoobs> btw, How do you enter the movie night lottery? Do you really get insta-perma banned if your movie is chosen?
<Meanwhile> Yes, that's how it works.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> aww ;_;
<KrazyNoobs> I hope that is sarcasm
<Meanwhile> It isn't.
<KrazyNoobs> I want to hear it from an admin before I believe it
<Cypresswolf> I want to get the rest of those Hobbit figures this week....If I order them online, I'll probably have a large crate delivered to my door...$15 per figure is pricey though...
<aniderp|bestcakeever> if meanwhile gets picked then he gets it i think
<KrazyNoobs> But assuming you did get insta-perma banned for having your movie chosen, WHY WOULD THAT BE!?
*SuperBrony64 noms on Meanwhile -.-
<Saturn> 08,01KrazyNoobs: because we hate you all
<Meanwhile> If I get picked I'll get rerolled without anyone saying anything.
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: that's because you pick shit films
<Meanwhile> You clearly have no taste.
<Meanwhile> With your Requiem for a Dream headache.
<KrazyNoobs> Cinderella 1997... WHO CHOSE THAT ONE!?
<Cypresswolf> KrazyNoobs: only if your movie choice get WMC - worst movie clause
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Speed Racer was an awesome movie~
<Gold_Demona> ^
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile's picks are insta-wmc
<Meanwhile> Like I said, no taste
<KrazyNoobs> LOL, How do you choose a movie? I get led to this graph, but what do I do from there?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> woudl you guys like if elf or polar express got picked from my lotto thingy?
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i loved requiem for a dream
<Meanwhile> That says it all really. :P
<CTHULHU> how do you join the lottery?
<KrazyNoobs> how do you join the lottery?
<Saturn> 08,01it was a good film!
<Saturn> 08,01like trainspotting
<Cypresswolf> I'd like to see Monkey Bone get chosen, just to see if that is WMC worthy - I like to think it is
<SuperBrony64> 11,02KrazyNoobs: Enter the lottery survey by going to http://survey.bronystate.net
<Saturn> 08,01but less cheery
<aniderp|bestcakeever> who likes polar express?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02That signs you up for the newsletter.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i get an email tomorow i think?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yeah
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Just need to finish dat newsletter >>;
<KrazyNoobs> SuperBrony64: *no survey available*
<Saturn> 08,01we really need a better way of signing up to the newsletter
<Mutterguy> 'No available surveys'
<Saturn> 08,01you can't sign up unless there's an active survey
<SuperBrony64> 11,02KrazyNoobs: You have to wait until a survey is created, it's when the newsletter goes out.
<Saturn> 08,01whcih there won't be until newsletter
<KrazyNoobs> How do I sign up for the newsletter?
<Saturn> 08,01it's a catch-22
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Once the survey is available
<KrazyNoobs> k, thanks
<Saturn> 08,01you sign up to the newsletter- when there's a survey available
<aniderp|bestcakeever> guess what my cursor for my laptop is :P
<Saturn> 08,01you know when there's a survey available because we send out a newsletter
<Saturn> 08,01it's a never-ending cycle of disappointment
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You sign up for the newsletter when it's too late to sign up for the newsletter.
<Saturn> 08,01just like Meanwhile's sex life
<KrazyNoobs> Did the a------ who chose Cinderella (1997) get WMC?
<Saturn> 08,01(i <3 you really, man)

<RaveBrony> Echoooo
<Phase4> 00,02Mike, but yeah, my headphones broke because they're made of twigs, lasted a good year, and the amplifier is denon's fault, it arrived in a subtly broken state

<Sylandest> quiet bstate is quiet...morning all...>.> <.<
<pony_2456> hi
<Sylandest> howdy anon pony_2456
<pony_2456> how are you this morning?
<Sylandest> sleepy, stressed
<pony_2456> hmm, stressed about what?
<Sylandest> Final exams
<Sylandest> I got only one today, but you never can feel too good about a college final
<pony_2456> ya, those are always stressful
<pony_2456> what subject is it in?
<Sylandest> Sociology. Specifically, Social Deviance.
<pony_2456> ouch, well good luck with that
<Sylandest> Here's hoping. Its not too hard a class, so much as just a mass wave of info
<pony_2456> I've spent all morning so far shoveling snow -.-
<Sylandest> I would prefer to shovel snow than take an exam, myself
<pony_2456> there's a least 18 inches out there, maybe more in the spots that driffted
<pony_2456> and we have a giant driveway to shovel, lol
<Sylandest> Still better than exams
<pony_2456> I think i'd rather take exams
<MadSurge> Sylandest: Well you have a whole fandom of "deviants" to study, amirite? :D
<Sylandest> MadSurge: my god, someone else lives. And trust me, you have no idea how much I secretly study you all...
<Sylandest> ...
<Sylandest> you weren't supposed to hear that...
<MadSurge> Sylandest: well you don't study ME in particular, so I'm not worried :D
<Sylandest> MadSurge: thats what *you* think~
*Jmo slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
<MadSurge> Sylandest: the creator of "Ballad of the Brony" did a study like that on bronies as deviants (with its original definition ofc)
*Sylandest slaps Jmo around a bit with finals
*Jmo slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
<MadSurge> Het Jmo
*Sylandest slaps Jmo around a bit with finals
<MadSurge> *hey
*Jmo slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
<Sylandest> MadSurge: I'm not sure if I read up on that or not. What did he find?
<MadSurge> I'm hungry, skap me too
<MadSurge> *slap
*Sylandest skaps MadSurge
<MadSurge> Sylandest: that they qualify as deviants? I don't remember :D
<MadSurge> Deviants as "people who stray from normality", not maniacs :D
<Sylandest> MadSurge: Well, technically, they do, according to what we've been taught. But its not a bad label, as that connotation is often applied. Its more just that they oppose or do not follow society's typical tracks
<MadSurge> Sylandest: indeed
<Sylandest> ...mine's fancier!
<Sylandest> :P
<MadSurge> I am not fancy :D
<Bronysith> mmm
<Bronysith> 40k followers for princess molestia
<MadSurge> Sylandest: but you are the student, so it's normal you have fancier words~
<Sylandest> sweet mother of god, thats a lot of followers

<TwilightSonata> How's everyone doing today? :D
<CrystalPhoenix> good thing the music is good enough to compensate
<Yahoo> TwilightSonata: oh hey its the newfoal

<Bronysith> CrystalPhoenix: i mean safer sepiroth is like an hour long battle if you dont have knights of the round XD
<TwilightSonata> So like, um, could you guys tell me some stuff about yourselves then?
<CrystalPhoenix> pretty much

<MadSurge> JRP2234: it's not a port, it's a whole different game!
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/t7dhU JRP2234
<JRP2234> MadSurge it still uses dooms engin
<JRP2234> its techincaly a port
<emangamer> evil point bit level hacking
<Bronysith> god, some of these photoshops are really good
<MadSurge> JRP2234: it's more like a wad then
<AttackWithHugs> Morning.
<Jmo> Dat fluffeh
<TwilightSonata> So I guess you're all guys here then? :P
<JRP2234> MadSurge doom 64 is a hevily modified doom engin
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs! <3
<emangamer> hey AttackWithHugs
<AttackWithHugs> Hi emangamer
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge! <3
<MadSurge> TwilightSonata: not AttackWithHugs :D
<emangamer> what's up
<AttackWithHugs> Eh, woke up about 10 minutes ago.
<TwilightSonata> MadSurge: Oh, awesome :3
<JRP2234> duke nukem 64 isent a port
<Bronysith> duke nukem sucks
<JRP2234> it uses a difrent game engin instead of build
<TwilightSonata> Nice to know there are other chicks on here ^_^
<emangamer> it's time to kickass and chew bubblegum
<AttackWithHugs> Have class tomorrow so I have to ask my niece's dad if he can watch her. Or his sister.
<emangamer> and I'm all out of gum
<AttackWithHugs> http://i.imgur.com/t2Xtd.jpg
<Bronysith> and duke nukem is a fag
<JRP2234> Bronysith yes the new one sucks but the old ones were awesome
<emangamer> ^
<Bronysith> nah
<TwilightSonata> AttackWithHugs: So I guess you're a fellow pegasister? Hahaha x
<emangamer> duke was the king
<Bronysith> nah
<Bronysith> DOOM guy is still king of shooters
<AttackWithHugs> TwilightSonata, yes.
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: *o* SO PRETTY
<Bronysith> even though doom is retardedly overrated
<Vivix> Sadly, yes
<Vivix> I liked doom as a kid, but it's not the best game of all time
<Bronysith> and so is goldeneye
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge, I want that cotton candy. So much diabetes to be had afterwards, but worth it.
<Bronysith> and ocarina of time
<Vivix> I didn't even know goldeneye was popular
<Bronysith> and chrono trigger
<TwilightSonata> AttackWithHugs: That's awesome, I haven't met many other girls who like MLP before, surprisingly enough XD
<Bronysith> and final fantasy 7
<emangamer> of course neither doom or golden eye are the best game ever of all time
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: indeed :D
<Bronysith> Vivix: to be fair, it brought FPS to the consoles >.>
<emangamer> that game toes to Drake of the 99 dragons
<Vivix> Bronysith, oh yeah- that's true...
<TwilightSonata> plus as far as I know I'm the only one at school who watches it...
<Bronysith> Legend of dragoon is probably my fav RPG right behind chrono trigger
<JRP2234> doom was the cod backthen
*Bronysith smacks JRP2234
<Bronysith> no
<JRP2234> OVERRATTED
<Bronysith> well yea
<Bronysith> CoD is overrated, not a bad game but it is the same game rereleased every single fucking year
<JRP2234> theres always that one game thats over rated
<Bronysith> but heres the thing
<Bronysith> overrated=/=bad
<emangamer> true
<JRP2234> cod 89 is just the same game as cod 66
<Bronysith> die in a final burst
<CrystalPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1355151635828.png
<MadSurge> At least Doom had different enemies instead of one guy with different guns
<emangamer> overrated==more hyped than it's worth
<JRP2234> guys apparently we all die in 10 days
<[Alpha]> That is awesome
<Bronysith> final fantasy 7 is super fucking overrated
<MadSurge> JRP2234: suuuuure :D
<TwilightSonata> I play CoD sometimes, my ex used to play it the whooole time haha
<Bronysith> but still one of my fav games of all time
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya everyone :)
<[Alpha]> Call of Duty is lame
<JRP2234> heres why i stoped playing
<JRP2234> ITS
<JRP2234> FUCKING
<JRP2234> BORING
<TwilightSonata> I never really got into it, but the multiplayer is fuuun ^_^
<Bronysith> cloud, even though he is a whiny bitch, is still somewhat a likeable character, he gets WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too much hate
<JRP2234> the same crap every year
<[Alpha]> I like the storyline though
<Bronysith> i mean hes nowhere near as awesome as say, Dart Feld, or Terra
<JRP2234> ^^^
<emangamer> JRP2234: I mean, it's fun for the first little while but it does get old pretty fast
<JRP2234> ^^
<MadSurge> TwilightSonata: I prefer Team Fortress 2 :)
<Bronysith> of course
<Bronysith> team fortress 2 is pretty much win >.>

<AttackWithHugs> http://i.imgur.com/RpEON.jpg
<[Alpha]> So anyone have pony mods for TF2?
<JRP2234> gaben]
<emangamer> I hate how everyone pissed on Shadowrun for being multiplayer only but that's all that TF2 is
<Bronysith> left 4 dead 2 is also fun when you have a full party of people WHO KNOW HOW TO FUCKING PLAY THE GAME RIGHT
<Barbetos|AtWork> I look strange without my beard.

<emangamer> OH GOD....The matt smith jokes
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: it's the forum of this site called The Round Stable. It was made by Something Awful goons because the SA thread was eventually gassed

<emangamer> Everlasting_Joy: reading the otakon x daribot ship fic
<emangamer> oh god the nastolgia
<CrystalPhoenix> nostalgia
<Everlasting_Joy> emangamer: I think it was read here live once. It was weird.
<emangamer> Everlasting_Joy: it's fucking amazing
<emangamer> "Otakon turned as well, once more gazing into the pitch black eyes of Daribot. Nervously, almost hesitantly, he closed the gap between them, reached out, and took the cold metallic hands in his own. Smiling, a single tear sliding down his left cheek, Otakon closed his eyes and pressed his lips again the unmoving lips of Daribot."
<Alchemist> CrystalPhoenix: we dont know. But seeing how Ingram is aware of her and obviously endorses her, she might have a bright future.
<CrystalPhoenix> indeed
<jcelios> gives me a warm fuzzy fantasy of everyone involved in FiM being best friends and hanging out together
<Everlasting_Joy> emangamer: Yep, that's the one :D.
<emangamer> Everlasting_Joy: ofc it is, it's amazing

<Meanwhile> Everlasting_Joy: Ikr. Seriously, Esamir's name should just be changed to Vanumir. 80% of the map all day and convoys steamrolling every point of resistance. If I could snipe through the warpgate dome I'd just stay there.
<Sumica> 00,10shame they nerfed mines just after I got them too
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica: Are you going to play PS2 if/when the servers come back up?

<Dark92Enigma> this is proof they left Marvel VS Capcom 3 DEAD

<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: Cloud strife
<Lunac> Hi Deacon EVTrain
<Lunac> Some of the names in here are too long.
<Deacon|EVTrain> SpadeKyurem becuase they use loreal
<Bronysith> i cant believe this is the last week of the semester
<Bronysith> holy shit
<thisguyLuis> luna <3 :3
<SpadeKyurem> Deacon|EVTrain: Because they're worth it?
<AttackWithHugs> I know that feel, Bronysith
<CrystalPhoenix> dat EileMonty cover <3
<Deacon|EVTrain> SpadeKyurem exactly!
*Ponies47 glomps AttackWithHugs :3
<CrystalPhoenix> though the PMV is meh
<CrystalPhoenix> it doesn't know what style it wants to be
<gdlk_ouo> yay ponies
*thelonepony|school pokes Ponies47 :3
*AttackWithHugs squeezes Ponies47
<thisguyLuis> not sure what luna would think about ravers since they do party literally all night
<SpadeKyurem> Ya know luna, most ponys sleep during the night, maybe thats why they dont apreciate it
<Bronysith> luna
<CrystalPhoenix> and it just doesn't blend well together
<Bronysith> you should be more grateful
<gdlk_ouo> woona
<Deacon|EVTrain> this must've been out a few weeks ago
<Bronysith> couples make love at the nighttime
<jcelios> personally I prefer to sleep all day though :P
<Deacon|EVTrain> or I just haven't heard that many fan songs
<Sylandest> Its a good song, though...im impressed.
<Ponies47> thelonepony|school, Dang it man! Focus! Get back to work! :D
<thelonepony|school> naw
<thelonepony|school> :3
<CrystalPhoenix> Sylandest, were you doubting Ponyphonic?
<Bronysith> Picture perfect pony=greatest fan song ever
*AttackWithHugs takes thelonepony|school's computer
<Ponies47> Okie doki loki then thelonepony|school :3
<Bronysith> And fan animation
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, I disagree
<Sylandest> CrystalPhoenix: I wasn't. First time I've heard it.
<CrystalPhoenix> fanimation yes
<CrystalPhoenix> but song no
<Bronysith> Dusks dawn=worst fan animation ever
<jcelios> ^
<SpadeKyurem> I still think that Luna basically had a tantrum or something because she didnt consider most ponies might be sleeping at night? so maybe thats why they dont apreciate it?
<thelonepony|school> and cause, i'm almost done with a project :3
<thisguyLuis> you know who i'd think would love luna the most? military people. since they often operate at night, and they're less likely to be spotted :P
<Bronysith> japanese version digimon>american version
<Bronysith> FUCKING 4 KIDS
<Bronysith> DIE

*Bronysith slaps naturesfury
<Deacon|EVTrain> Sumica it's still 4kids fault
<Bipolarized> Considering Luna's a dreamwalker you think she would've been fine with ponies sleeping at night.
<MaxTheBrony> :C
<VenHur> Sumica: At least that's a plus...
<Deacon|EVTrain> someway
<SpadeKyurem> 4 kids ruined One piece

<Bronysith> yamato? thats the name of my weapons in PSO
<Deacon|EVTrain> correction: the american movie sucked, because it was three movies sewn into one
<MaxTheBrony> :C
<AttackWithHugs> three?
<VenHur> Bronysith: True, but the first act is the most cannon of the three.
<SpadeKyurem> Deacon|EVTrain: Thats why it felt so disjointed?
<AttackWithHugs> I thought it was two.
<Bronysith> VenHur: *canon
<Bronysith> ONII CHAN
<thelonepony|school> SpadeKyurem: Riba, dolan and gooby went to the Digimon world to find hi,
<AttackWithHugs> Diaboromon and then Kokomon
<Deacon|EVTrain> it was three or two, can't remember
<thelonepony|school> Ribu*

<MaxTheBrony> Pooping all over the place
<Alchemist> Scrambled eggs with rice and salt is great.
<Kencolt> Omurice. An omelette wrapped around fried rice, (usually chicken) and topped with catsup. A great favorite with Japanese children.
<naturesfury> wetting the bed and sitting all over the table are a bit of a jump from eachother

<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: what about donut holes?
<SpadeKyurem> Kencolt: It cant be that hard to explain what it is
<Deacon|EVTrain> SpadeKyurem I'd still like a jelly donut shaped like a riceball
<Alchemist> what does onii chan mean? little brother?
<Kencolt> SpadeKyurem: Jelly Doughnuts do not have holes.
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: or eclairs?
<SpadeKyurem> Bronysith: the fact they tried to pass off Onigiri as jelly donuts
<Bronysith> is bullshit

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Tuition is only 5 easy monthly payments of $4,999.95, that's just pennies a day.
<HoodEevee|Skool> 10000000 pennies a day
<thelonecubone|School> Yay :3
<AttackWithHugs> But....I can't afford that!
<djblazekin> whats the prize usually for the lotto
<AttackWithHugs> I want to speak to the Financial Aid!
<Alchemist> 25k per semester?
<Deacombee|EVTrain> woo!
<HoodEevee|Skool> I have five bucks
<CCharmanderK> If memory serves right, this Friday's movies are Gladiator and some foreign animated movie called George the Hedgehog.
<Gekoncze> I'm studying for tomorrow exam from philosophy
<Everlasting_Joy> SuperBrony64: I can afford that, I just won't eat lunch for two days.
<HoodEevee|Skool> Is that enough?
<Petrified_Discord> AttackWithHugs: That'll cost ya...
<thelonecubone|School> but, that means i have to work in El Pollo loco again ;3;
<SuperBrony64> 11,02djblazekin: Your selection gets featured at Brony Movie Night :)
<SpadeKyurem> CCharmanderK: Sonic's lost cousin?
<Kandarihu> CCharmanderK, George the Hedgehog was cut
<jcelios> Mars Attacks is B
<AttackWithHugs> Petrified_Discord, well I can't get a grant XD
<CCharmanderK> Mars Attacks?! FUCK YEAH!!!\
<Gekoncze> It's kinda hard for me to remember all the philosophy stuff
<thelonecubone|School> I still lol how Neil acted the next day
<djblazekin> thats cool
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Everlasting_Joy: Two days? LE HORROR

*HoodEevee|Skool stereotypes
<CCharmanderK> AttackWithHugs: Be nice.
<djblazekin> round 3 again
<HoodEevee|Skool> djblazekin: Stop. Sucking.
<Alchemist> SuperBrony64: can you guys post the nomination table every week along with the actual winners? sometimes thats the only way to know if our selections are eligible in the first place.
<CCharmanderK> Besides, I'k glad that George the Hedgehog got cut. I looked up the trailer, and it was uglier than my grandmother's ass.
<HoodEevee|Skool> CCharmanderK: I don't even want to know
<AttackWithHugs> ...why were you looking at your grandmother's ass in the first place?
<HoodEevee|Skool> ^
<AttackWithHugs> Unless you're assisting her?
<thelonecubone|School> CCharmanderK: Neil does hace a Habit to Try and Play with chat
<CCharmanderK> If George DID get streamed, I think it would get become C-rank in a heartbeat.
<thelonecubone|School> have*
<SpadeKyurem> C rank?
<HoodEevee|Skool> It would be black listed
<Petrified_Discord> Stank rank
<djblazekin> fuck i got cornered and downed twice couldn't rebuy quick revive
<thelonecubone|School> ohai twilight_sprinkl|afk :3
<CCharmanderK> C-rank movies are below B-rank movies. They are played once and never played again because they are so bad.
<HoodEevee|Skool> To never watch again
<HoodEevee|Skool> twilight_sprinkl|afk: No, gtfo or chang your nick, tis pokehour
<AttackWithHugs> basically, WMC'ed
<Kimori> goodluck on it :)
<CCharmanderK> George the Hedgehog would be a C-rank if it were streamed here.
<CCharmanderK> Pokehour? Then I don't have to change anything! XD
<SpadeKyurem> George the hedgehog sounds like Sonic's retarded cousin
<Kandarihu> CCharmanderK, some people were rather hurt that it was cut, since there was a lot of sexual content in it. It's the controversy is going to make my B-Movie choice a much harder sell now. And for the record, it was not WMC'd. It's cut ONLY because of the sexual content.
<Alchemist> CCharmanderK: is the Room fall in this C category?
<Alchemist> *does
<HoodEevee|Skool> Kandarihu: Wait, its about hedgehogs and nudity?
<HoodEevee|Skool> Who recomended a furry movie?
<Alchemist> I can no inglish
<HoodEevee|Skool> :D
<CCharmanderK> Alchemist: No, I'm pretty sure that's B-grade because it's still fun to watch for shits and giggles.
<Gekoncze> thx :)
<HoodEevee|Skool> That's too funny
<Everlasting_Joy> Alchemist: It has been shown and it hasn't been WMCed.
<x1es> SuperBrony64: Dude, guess what?
<AttackWithHugs> Last time I checked, hedgehogs don't wear clothing
<AttackWithHugs> NO, SONIC AND CO DOESN'T COUNT
<HoodEevee|Skool> Sexual nudity
<MadSurge> HoodEevee|Skool: Oh it's Pokemon hour? LEt me think of am appropriate nick
<HoodEevee|Skool> You know what I meant
<Alchemist> Any kind f sex act will render a nomination null and void??
<AttackWithHugs> ^
<Kandarihu> HoodEevee|Skool, I only know what I heard here. But the omission of this movie is seen by some as overly oppressive censorship.
<CCharmanderK> Any kind of explicit sex act, anyway.
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R8GVUdc9xs Gotta escape fromt eh city
<Gustav> Hi all!
<AttackWithHugs> So that means The Room won't be shown anymore.
<HoodEevee|Skool> Gustav: Oi
<Alchemist> dammit, I have to change my a movie vote then... :(
<thelonecubone|School> Hi Gustav
<CCharmanderK> I saw some of George the Hedgehog, and I think that cutting it was a good choice.
<HoodEevee|Skool> I thought it got WMC
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Gustav :)
<MadSurge> Ah, nevermind
<Gustav> Hi! This is my first time here! Can anypony explain anything to me?
<CCharmanderK> George's sex scenes are disgusting and vile, much like the rest of the film.
<SpadeKyurem> I fucking love City Escape
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyurem, why escape when you can face your fears http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnUgeEGstDU

<thelonecubone|School> SpadeKyurem: you've been stealing. Good, Good.
<CrystalPhoenix> for one I preffer this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxftbJx_JUE

<SpadeKyurem> Bronysith: (\
<AttackWithHugs> There is a Shizu here :D
<SpadeKyurem> I love all the sonic music tracks but Live and Learn is still the best in my opinion
<HoodEevee|Skool> MadSurge: I thought we were sticking to 1st gen, but that could work
<djblazekin> round 4 this time
<CrystalPhoenix> I remember when I said live and learn was the best when I was a teenager
<HoodEevee|Skool> Oh shit, gtg
<MadSurge> HoodEevee|Skool: I know little of Pokemon, let me work with what I know :D

*thelonecubone|School slaps twilight_squirtle around a bit with a Large chancla :3

<CCharmanderK> Shizuka: Yeah, not if they're flipping around like a cartridge-tilted Goldeneye character.
<Shizuka> 13so as long as it's on its side you have a small amount of control but not much

<SpadeKyurem> Dont put the damn buttons where shadow can hit them
<Alchemist> Bronysith: dont matter
<Alchemist> Bronysith: and I was being sarcastic :)
<SpadeKyurem> I never really understood why the ARK worked in Shadow
<SpadeKyurem> Im pretty sure it stopped working after the Final Hazard fight
<Bronysith> SA2B is best 3d sonic game
<Bronysith> shadow the hedgehog sucks
<Bronysith> get over it
<SpadeKyurem> I know that...
<SpadeKyurem> Tbh I like how shadow was handled in Heroes
<Bronysith> heroes was underrated
<Scootaflew> The cuteness.... http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/331/7/4/scootaloo_and_her_milkshake__3_by_rhubarb_leaf-d5mcehz.png
<SpadeKyurem> It was left ambigous if he was the real shadow or a robot
<Bronysith> sonic heroes that is
<SpadeKyurem> I liked that
<SpadeKyurem> But my god Heroes was shiny as fuck
<Deacombee|EVTrain> Scootaflew d'aww
<Bronysith> Scootaflew: her face and position is really really...no
<Scootaflew> Bronysith: But wasn't that how she appeared in the episode?
<Bronysith> yea
<Bronysith> it is really suggestive though
<Scootaflew> Still...
<Scootaflew> O.o
<Deacombee|EVTrain> it's only suggestive to the dirty mind.....
<CCharmanderK> What you guys talking bout?
<Deacombee|EVTrain> no idea
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODKaVpMYZfg Love this
<GoldenMic> stream down. =(
<CCharmanderK> Listening to anime music right now. <3
<CCharmanderK> Anime music is best music.
<Scootaflew> Bronysith: Found a better one, but not scoots D: http://forum.yugiohcardmaker.net/uploads/profile/photo-72432.gif?_r=1354404625
<CCharmanderK> And JAM Project is best band.
<CCharmanderK> Scootaflew: HNNNNGG
<Bronysith> Scootaflew: you see, sweetie belles position and facial expression wasnt suggestive
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo4kwf5jBQ4 Go go metal sonic!
<CCharmanderK> NOW LISTENING TO: Fire Wars by JAM Project (theme to Mazinkaiser)
<CCharmanderK> A very badass song
<GoldenMic> dance party?
<Deacombee|EVTrain> my friend had an idea for a sonic game that involved time travel, going back to feudal japan (because he says that's where sonic is from), with eggman kidnapping his ancestry for some reason
<CCharmanderK> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=950j9Kxiwic
<SpadeKyurem> Also the riverwood shop owner is down a sister
<SpadeKyurem> Guess how
<Deacombee|EVTrain> and a whopping 24+ levels
<Buytoast> going back to feudal japan because that's where sonic is from
<Buytoast> what
<CCharmanderK> OOH!!
<GoldenMic> Sounds like the next sly cooper
<CCharmanderK> NOW LISTENING TO: It's Love by RABBIT (theme of Ranma 1/2 The Movie)
<Deacombee|EVTrain> and I didn;t say anything, but I really don't like that idea
*CCharmanderK loves Ranma 1/2.
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CatAO-Kt5Wo I love this fan game's sound track
<GoldenMic> i do to
*CCharmanderK also loves the theme to the Ranma 1/2 movie.
<GoldenMic> awesome show.
<CCharmanderK> I used to see the trailer for Ranma 1/2 The Movie on almost every single Pokemon VHS I saw as a kid. I could never get the song out of my head.
<prince-dari> I love how you can remove Virgin Media's block on Pirate Bay by adding one line to your hosts file.
<prince-dari> Just goes to show how pointless the block was.
<SpadeKyurem> Virgin media?
<prince-dari> UK ISP
<Bronysith> anyone here like shadow of the colossus?
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N5XWD2DQDk
<CCharmanderK> Although I'm baffled as to exactly why VIZ put the trailer for a series as sexual as Ranma 1/2 on Pokemon tapes...
<CCharmanderK> Though the Ranma 1/2 Movie is actually rather tame in comparison to everything else in the franchise...
<Punkie_Pue> Your isp was blocking pirate bay?
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExRbBrVn5XI Objection!
<MaxTheBrony> Saturn you here? :p
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: you win a medal
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: im working on a cosplay of phoenix wright
<SpadeKyurem> Woo
<Bronysith> goddamn wig

<Deacombee|EVTrain> lali-ho emangamer
<emangamer> Oh god I love cherry vanilla coke
<CCharmanderK> >diet Coke.
<CCharmanderK> Ew.
<Deacombee|EVTrain> I can't remember he last time I had vanilla coke

<aniderp|bestcakeever> hi
<MaxTheBrony> Heya aniderp|bestcakeever
<Deacombee|EVTrain> lali-ho aniderp|bestcakeever!
<SpadeKyurem> Paladin is best class :3
<emangamer> Horde is beat facion
<Deacombee|EVTrain> SpadeKyurem why yes it is
<emangamer> Faction*
<SpadeKyurem> Not right now eman
<Bronysith> horde is ONLY faction
<SpadeKyurem> I hate Garrosh
<SpadeKyurem> Once Thrall goes back I'll be good
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: you mean shinji?
<SpadeKyurem> Also Chen Stormstout is best Pandaren
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/dd55486eddaf30f12f059350cf47f755.jpg AttackWithHugs: Prankster, prankster Pinkie Pie! :D
<Punkie_Pue> :D
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: That Pinkie Pie!
<emangamer> Ohau Nittany_Discord
<SpadeKyurem> Mists of Pandaria more than make sup for the slight disapointment Catacylsm was
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: cata was slightly disapointing?
<Bronysith> slightly?
<SpadeKyurem> Bronysith: To me
<Bronysith> only slightly though?
<SpadeKyurem> Eh
<SpadeKyurem> I didnt really like DS if anything
<Bronysith> wrath of the lich king was awesome and burning crusade...
<Bronysith> orgasmic
<emangamer> You know what else is a slight disappointment?
<SpadeKyurem> Bronysith: God the hellreaver
<SpadeKyurem> That was hell
<emangamer> MY MOM!
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: remember the first time you walked through the gates?
<Scootaflew> I love me some apples... http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/344/e/1/party_png_by_zutheskunk-d5nl5w5.png
<SpadeKyurem> Bronysith: I was flabbergasted
<SpadeKyurem> SO many demons
<jcelios> Applejack has gone full apple...
<Scootaflew> true
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: i didnt even immediately walk through the dark gates, i just stood there marveling at it, a little scared to go through, and then walked in to a whole new world
<Bronysith> and holy fuck
<Bronysith> so overwhelming
<SpadeKyurem> I feel kinda pathetic I never joined a guild or did a raid till I was lvl 80
<SpadeKyurem> I still havent cleared a Cata raid besides DS and most of FL
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: my guild was top on the horde side of our server, it was awesome
<Scootaflew> Derpy is a successful business owner http://i.imgur.com/DJITr.png
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: and when i first got shadowmourne, holy fuck
<CrystalPhoenix> Scootaflew, well there goes my heart
<SpadeKyurem> Most the horde seems like a bunch of assholes so I prefure the Alliance
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: my guild was awesome though
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyurem, it's either the snoby prick or the uncouth jerks
<CrystalPhoenix> choose your poison
<SpadeKyurem> The Alliance seems more likeable than the horde
<Bronysith> CrystalPhoenix: do you mean the alliance? the faction for 12 year olds
<SpadeKyurem> Bronysith: Hey!
<SpadeKyurem> :(
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, I just associate both Alliance and Horde
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: on my server the horde were nice people
<CrystalPhoenix> also the faction community depends on servers
<SpadeKyurem> My guild is full of nice people
<Scootaflew> Activate sad mode http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/263/5/a/sad_pie_by_dhui-d5fe4zu.jpg
<Bronysith> and i mostly stuck with my aweosme guild, i actually hang with some of them in real life
<SpadeKyurem> But god help you going on trade
<CrystalPhoenix> in some it's the Horde that are nice
<CrystalPhoenix> in others it's Alliance
<SpadeKyurem> Bronysith: remember Barrens chat?
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: my guild leader was actually in the some state as me and she is really awesome
<Deacombee|EVTrain> welp, bbl I guess, kinda busy
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: hehe
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: thats why i sped through that area for leveling XD
<Scootaflew> Never ask derpy about her bubbles http://i.imgur.com/2nzl1.jpg
<Bronysith> Scootaflew: dat gore
<MadSurge> Scootaflew: why
<Bronysith> Scootaflew: have fun getting kicked
<Scootaflew> D;
<ekips> Scootaflew my poor eyes can't handle all that gore >.>
<SpadeKyurem> Imo I think Blizzard made the loot system worse in pandaria for raids
<jcelios> gore!?
<jcelios> :o
<SpadeKyurem> 15% for any loot same for using a coin, more or less you just get fucking gold
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, I'm sorry but that's not gore
<Bronysith> CrystalPhoenix: it is still not appropriate for chat
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/efcfbbb6e839646e60aa3db5a3748092.png The Paperbag Mare! :D
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtUpWihJJJ4
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, that can be arguable really
<SpadeKyurem> Also the game can be a dick to you and give you the same gear twice
<Bronysith> have some Evabridged
<SpadeKyurem> I dont know about anyone else but I liked having a confimed chance of getting any gear instead of a slim chance
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: take the bitching to blizzard
<Bronysith> like they give a fuck
<Scootaflew> Dude... This grass... Feels like grass.... http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/251/0/d/0ddbeb876eb729c4088cb0d6d7e0d8e2-d5e20mw.png
<SpadeKyurem> I still say 1000000 is way too many lesser charms to have at once
<Ponies47> GTG. Bye everypony~
<AttackWithHugs> Bye Ponies47
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye Ponies47 :)
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1355172595636.jpg
<SpadeKyurem> Bronysith: All I see is a logo
<Bronysith> whatever
<Lasharus> Oh goodie!
<Lasharus> I just glanced at the chat to find complaints about WoW's loot distribution!
<Lasharus> Be still my ever-excited beating heart!
<SpadeKyurem> Could your sarcasm be any more blatant
<Stallion_of_War> I think I'd rather just watch the loop of all these images than the current Yogscast livestream
<Lasharus> That was sort of the POINT.
<GilDash|Busy> Holla everypony! :)
<Lasharus> If I wanted to read this tripe I'd go to the MMO-champion forums.
<Stallion_of_War> It looks rather boring
*Bronysith glomps and licks GilDash|Busy
<SpadeKyurem> Well excuuuuse me princess
<Barbetos|AtSanic> Ron Weasley will save you!
<AttackWithHugs> Hi GilDash|Busy
<Bronysith> ron weasely is the shinji ikari of the harry potter universe
<Barbetos|AtSanic> Shinji is worse
<Barbetos|AtSanic> He does not go fast.
<Lindeman> Hai guys
<SpadeKyurem> Gotta go fast
<Bronysith> and of course shadow was a cool character...then they made him into a shinji
<Bronysith> WHY?!
<alexxm> how are things Linderman
<Bronysith> WHY RUIN A COOL CHARACTER
<Lindeman> Atexxm Sweet, you?
<sonicdude558> hi again guys :)
<SpadeKyurem> The hell is a shinji
<Barbetos|AtSanic> A waffle
<sonicdude558> Yes, a few hours ago that was me
<Lasharus> ...Shadow was a cool character?
<Lasharus> Well, okay, he was acceptable in SA2.
<Barbetos|AtSanic> Shadow was filler!
<Bronysith> Lasharus: exactly
<sonicdude558> Damn. Not here
<MLP_Brovakiin> heya sonicdude558 :)
<SpadeKyurem> I liked Shadow
<Punkie_Pue> s ago
<Punkie_Pue> oops
<Lasharus> Every game since, however...
<alexxm> i'm good Linderman
<Bronysith> Lasharus: but they ruined him in shadow the hedgehog by making hima WHINING EMO BITCH
<Barbetos|AtSanic> damn distracting ponies
<Barbetos|AtSanic> I has work to do!
<Lasharus> "I've got amnesia" What, AGAIN!? Could you bloody well write a DIARY or something?
<SpadeKyurem> I kind of liked how Shadow was handled in Heroes
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: you already said that
<SpadeKyurem> They left his real fate ambiguous
<Bronysith> you already said that
<Bronysith> today
<sonicdude558> Wheres that DAMN 4th Chaos Emerald?
<Lasharus> And they left his characteristics uninteresting.
<Lasharus> "Maria?" Oh shut up.
<SpadeKyurem> Still more interesting than Silver
<Lasharus> There I'll agree with you.
<SpadeKyurem> I really like Blaze as a character though
<Lasharus> If only because Silver's one of the most preposterously idiotically written characters in the series. Thank you, Sonic 2006. You sick, stupid, moronic game.
<Bronysith> Sonic, knuckles, and tails are the only tolerable characters
<Bronysith> except current sonic
<Bronysith> HE SUCKS
<Lasharus> Bronysith: DOCTOR ROBOTNIK!
<SpadeKyurem> Bronysith: Da hell
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: i like old sonic cause current one wont shut the fuck up
<Lasharus> Current Sonic is mildly acceptable now that they replaced his Voice Actor, Bronysith. :P
<Lasharus> Now at least he can act being intolerable.
<Barbetos|AtSanic> Look. Its Sumida! The evil version.
<SpadeKyurem> Oh jesus..whine whine
<Barbetos|AtSanic> He makes you watch streams on dail up.
<Barbetos|AtSanic> D=
<Lasharus> Ghehehehehe.
<Lasharus> But yeah Bronysith, you can't excluse Dr. Robotnik from the lineup of good Sonic characters.
<Lasharus> The series would've been rather pointless without him. :P
<Bronysith> Lasharus: you know what they say
<Bronysith> the more the merrier
<Lasharus> The more the m- *SHOT*
<Bronysith> you know what they say, the more the merrier
<Lasharus> Yes, he had his awful moments too :P
<Bronysith> you know what they say, the more the merrier
<Lasharus> But Colours was genius.
<Bronysith> you know what they say, the more the merrier
<Bronysith> okay im done
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySsrnlj6MfE
<Lasharus> "Ladies and gentlemen, we appear to have lost pressure on spaceship deck 8. If you are currently on that deck, please hold your breath against the vacuum of space until you pass out. After that, you won't care."
<SpadeKyurem> They made a crazy taxi reference in that game
<Barbetos|AtSanic> Copypasta
<Lasharus> That song was brilliantly done, SpadeKyurem..
<Lasharus> I disliked the remix of the Egg Dragoon theme, but the DESIGN of that thing... *smile*
<SpadeKyurem> We shall provide insulin for a marginal fee

<Lasharus> Nah. Song's not that good. I liked the original better.
<Lasharus> The fight itself was quite well made, in my opinion.
<Lasharus> Oh damnit, I'm fanboyrambling again.
<Lasharus> You lot should really stop me from doing that, you know.

<AJIsAwesome> twilight_squirtle: ._.
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyurem, that is possible but still I hate that decision of his
<CrystalPhoenix> cause it removes the charm of Paper Mario
<SpadeKyurem> Not sure why he wanted a simple story
<SpadeKyurem> He said he didnt want any origonal characters either...seems legit
<Bronysith> hmmm

<thelonecubone|GTA4> No? okay
<otakon> also, Filies in hoody pajama's are TOO GODDAMN CUTE
<twilight_squirtle> SpadeKyurem: its not the worst government out there. at least you can actually choose, whereas in countries like russia you dont even get a say in the matter
<Ryunosuke> SpadeKyurem: i voted for obama, only because the American Taliban, I mean the Republican, I mean the Tea Party is a hell of a lot worse :)
<SpadeKyurem> Oh dont play the god damn racisim card

<twilight_squirtle> bye MaxTheBrony
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXrymV-Lgtw Love this boss theme so much
<AJIsAwesome> Night, MaxTheBrony. :)
<Artifact> I know but lets just worship in secret like chatholics in roman times
<AttackWithHugs> What the hell.....is going on?
<Socks> Yahooz: THE GREAT AND MIGHTY!
<Shizuka> 13hm
<Bronysith> great mighty poo?
<Yahooz> i dont even
<AJIsAwesome> AttackWithHugs: I have absolutely no idea.
<twilight_squirtle> AttackWithHugs: we found out that our god gaк has a son, uck
<Shizuka> 13i wonder how many legitimate users we have that hang out in bronymusic
<AttackWithHugs> twilight_squirtle, WHAT. How is that even possible??
<Artifact> I do
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5Yes, I do wonder so.
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: ?
<Yahooz> Shizuka: like, one
<twilight_squirtle> i was only in bronymusic once that one time with the whole war thing
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: What's going on in bronymusic?
<Shizuka> 13cause i'm sorely tempted to insert an extban that locks out anyone who's in that channel from joining here
<Socks> :D I lol at other pony's non-understanding :D
<Alchemist> whats bronymusic? a channel here?
<Yahooz> Shizuka: after that incident? go for it
<otakon> Alchemist: yeah
<Shizuka> 13a channel harboring trolls
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5Do et
<otakon> Yahooz: no dammit, it's not fair to those that DON'T troll
<Michael|studying> do it then
<SpadeKyurem> Shizuka: So...4chan?
<Artifact> hehe
<Socks> What's this Shizuka?
<twilight_squirtle> Yahooz: there wasnt really an incident, it was just a few guys from that channel messing around
<Shizuka> 13that's why i'm asking, anyone who's in #bronymusic would be effectively banned here
<otakon> yeah bad idea I think
<SpadeKyurem> Shizuka: never heard of the place
<FlutterMEDIC> hey guys
<Bronysith> otakon: some good people had to die to eliminate the ultimate evils
<Shizuka> 13at least wouldn't be able to speak and wouldn't be able to rejoin after leaving
<Socks> That's a bit mean :/
<Michael|studying> hai FlutterMEDIC
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: that sounds like 4chan to m----oh, wait SpadeKyurem already did it
<otakon> Shizuka: at the very least, wait to confer with other mods eh?
<Yahooz> i mean, hey when they have an OP doing it, theres something up
<Shizuka> 13nip the trolling in the bud
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5Shizuka is the Jarl of another hold
<Yahooz> just sayin
<Alchemist> when was this incident?
<Dark92Enigma> Hi AJIsAwesome! :)
<Bronysith> shut up Socks and let the Shizuka do her job
<FlutterMEDIC> who and what won the lottery?
<SpadeKyurem> Shizuka: What about the ones from there that are nice?
<Shizuka> 13otakon: am
<otakon> good :)
<Alchemist> havent heard about it
<SpadeKyurem> If thats possible
<twilight_squirtle> Shizuka: i thought there were only 2-3 of the trolls there, wouldnt it be easier to just ban them?
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: I don't think that's a good idea. I can see some people who are in bronymusic and here at the same time not being a troll.
<BlazeAngel> JarlBaconTheGreater: Can I be thy court wizard, my jarl?
<otakon> SpadeKyurem: she's waiting to confer with the other mods
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5As another mod I support it so far :P
<Shizuka> 13so far we've had at least three trolls blunder in from there
<otakon> JarlBaconTheGreater: shush
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5BlazeAngel Nu
<FlutterMEDIC> Shizuka: what won the lottery?
<Shizuka> 13and a rumor that bronymusic wants to start shit with us
<BlazeAngel> JarlBaconTheGreater: D:
<SpadeKyurem> Wouldent it be unfair to the innocent victims?
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tt4-HU2FhQ
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: hiroshima
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5Protip: "LC" pings me too :P
<Michael|studying> FlutterMEDIC: Gladiator and Mars attacks
<Socks> I'm just saying that banning a whole community would be mean.
<Shizuka> 13consider it the nuclear option
<CrystalPhoenix> bronymusic?
<twilight_squirtle> Shizuka: bronymusic mods said that rumor was false though, i asked them that time
<AttackWithHugs> I only know one person from bronymusic who doesn't know about bstate but he's harmless
<Artifact> Mlp
<Artifact> dazzle
<Artifact> me
<Socks> What is BronyMusic?
<Yahooz> twilight_squirtle: while one of them actively trolled us. maybe he was a rouge, but whatever
<Bronysith> a channel
<twilight_squirtle> another channel, Socks
<SpadeKyurem> Crush 40 always does good music
<AJIsAwesome> Socks: Channel.
<Bronysith> harboring trolls
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5Yeah screw 'em
<Artifact> :O
<alexxm|colt> Socks presumbly music done by bronies
<Dark92Enigma> i can see some trolls, impersonators, etc
<Yahooz> Shizuka: all i know is that gunny /started/ the incident
<BlazeAngel> JarlBaconTheGreater: Can I be thy.... uh... butler?
<SpadeKyurem> I still say its being mean to the innocents
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: They say they want a revolutioooooon
<twilight_squirtle> Yahooz: the mods there told me that troll was new to their channel too
<Socks> Yeah, Internet newb here, You're gonna have to explain what you mean by "CHannel" another chat?
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5VIVE LE REVELECIEN
<SpadeKyurem> I dont think every single one of them deserves to be banned
<BlazeAngel> Dark92Enigma: Spartans againsted Romans or whatever hm?
<AJIsAwesome> Socks: Pretty much.
<Yahooz> twilight_squirtle: and hes an OP? huh
<Socks> Ok :)
<AttackWithHugs> And then channel wars
<Shizuka> 13http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/rfc.html
<SpadeKyurem> da hell is this
<BlazeAngel> Death?
<twilight_squirtle> Yahooz: hm, one of the trolls was an OP there? i thought that, but then i thought i remembered wrong. one of the other OPs told me they dont have anything against us though
<thelonecubone> Dark92Enigma: LEt's Give them One :D
<Socks> By JINGO!
<otakon> SpadeKyurem: THE VOID
<SpadeKyurem> Arent we being a little extreme here?
<Shizuka> 13in any event, trying to start conflicts with other channels is against network rules
*Artifact starwars theme plays
<AJIsAwesome> I'm pretty sure that not all of the people in bronymusic should be banned from coming here. That's kind of like banning people here that don't talk and only lurk.
<thelonecubone> ah
<Shizuka> 13so for the three of you that live in bronymusic, you'd better tell them to get a handle on their users
*Bronysith protects otakon from the nuclear option
<otakon> I'm okay
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka: Good point, but surely if only a few of them do, then wouldn't it be unfair to ban the peaceful fellows of Broymusic?
<otakon> I have a bunker
<Yahooz> twilight_squirtle: the guy that Shizuka wound up banning at first was one of the OPs.
<Bronysith> ... "with tonberries"
<otakon> AND MY SHIELD!
<SpadeKyurem> AND MY AXE
<Socks> I feel like a little child first realising that there are different countries
<Bronysith> otakon: i have tonberries
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2Ss2-FXkew All Hail Shadow!
<Bronysith> an entire army of the fuckers
<Shizuka> 13BlazeAngel: true, but they'd better have a handle on their users then
<otakon> yikes
<SpadeKyurem> Bronysith: I could kill those things easy
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka: Ah.
<Bronysith> otakon: not even a nuclear bomb can kill them
<otakon> um
<Shizuka> 13again, trying to start fights with other channels is against network rules, this would be nipping it in the bud
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: without knights of the round?
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: we're locked and loaded......
<otakon> should we go tell them?
<Michael|studying> if they can't handle their own users, then they shall be punished...
<otakon> I mean should someone go tell them what's going on?
<BlazeAngel> otakon: Maybe they can find out on their own.
<Artifact> ahh is it just me or is it getting a little...morbid in here/
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: I think that's a pretty good idea.
<Bronysith> otakon: we didnt tell hiroshima, or nagasaki
<Artifact> *?
<Yahooz> otakon: the mods can handle that
<otakon> I mean hell, we don't even get this much grief from #brony
<SpadeKyurem> God help you if you ran alot in ff6 and finds a stepmaster
*Socks grabs his spoon "I shall need this if we're going into battle!" :P
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: (i'm on THIS channel's side by the way, the mane chat)
<otakon> SpadeKyurem: O_o
<Yahooz> otakon: we never had anything against that channel
<BlazeAngel> Socks: We aren't. Not unless epcified.
<BlazeAngel> specified*
<Socks> LET ME AT EM!
<otakon> Yahooz: yeah, despite the fact that they've trolled before as well
<twilight_squirtle> Shizuka: i can try talking to them again aftr wednesday
<Socks> :P, me joking
<BlazeAngel> Socks: No. :3
<SpadeKyurem> Those fuckers do damage for how long you took steps so you can be easily wrecked
*thelonecubone holds Socks back :3
<Yahooz> some ancient users still hang out there
<GilDash|Busy> G'night everypony! :)
<Artifact> its getting scary in here:'(
<thelonecubone> Night GilDash|Busy :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight GilDash|Busy :)
<Michael|studying> Gnight GilDash|Busy
<AJIsAwesome> Night, GilDash|Busy. :)
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: and in ff7 they do the amount of damage depending on how many things youve killed
*Dark92Enigma reads what Shizuka recently posted. *yes, sir, ma'am sir*
<Socks> They will taste my steel!
<Shizuka> 13had i known about channelbanning at the start of the year we probably would have locked out #brony for all the trouble they caused us
<Socks> Night GilDash|Busy
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka: That was bad.
<SpadeKyurem> Bronysith: The ultimate anti grinder
<otakon> Shizuka: eeyup
<Artifact> ff6 is the best ff game
<Yahooz> Shizuka: effectively banning Rain, niiiiiice
<SpadeKyurem> FOR THE ALLIANCE!
<Socks> What happened with "brony"?
<Shizuka> 13nuclear options aren't fun
<Bronysith> Artifact: i tied it with final fantasy 7
<BlazeAngel> SpadeKyurem: No. :3
<Shizuka> 13Yahooz: +e
<Yahooz> Shizuka: or that
<Buytoast> sometimes the end must come
<Artifact> Bronysith:My top 3 are ff1 ff2 ff6
<Buytoast> and it must come with a thunderous finish
<BlazeAngel> Buytoast: And somtimes, we must not worry.
<Shizuka> 13there's a double symbolism with channelbanning being the nuclear option
<Shizuka> 13it's the option you never want to use
<Shizuka> 13the threat of it should be sufficient
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq9YM2xg7xg Fitting music? Maybe?
<BlazeAngel> Hm.

<BlazeAngel> Socks: I'm sorry, you're going to die.
<Bronysith> wheres MakerDusk when you need him
<AttackWithHugs> I have no clue what's going on besides talk of banning a channel. But that's because I live in only 3 channels, two of which I'm active in
<Socks> O.O
<Socks> NOOOO!

<wipergone2> Shizuka: hi

<otakon> BULLSHIT!
<Rainfall_Night> hi

<otakon> Rainfall_Night: um not really
<Yahooz> JarlBaconTheGreater: thats my procrastinating boy! ^_^

<Somasis> I heard there were trolls...?
<SpadeKyurem> Kill the trolls with fire
<thelonecubone> naw let's not
<thelonecubone> :>
<Somasis> just a question
<NeX-x> Are we the only ones that don't kill trolls with fire?
<Ryunosuke> burning trolls smell bad
<thelonecubone> ask away
<Rainfall_Night> at least we have something to ook at while we are off air
<twilight_squirtle> feed the trolls til they asplode
<u> haha
<otakon> and kicked
<Somasis> did any of the trolls spam any of you with 'swag' or something like that in private message?
<Ryunosuke> however their tears are sweet nectar :)
<Somasis> because if so I know who he is
<NeX-x> Whoa whoa whoa, since when is bold a color?
<thelonecubone> Somasis: Swaglestia
<Somasis> yeah, him
<otakon> NeX-x: you can't use colors unless you're a mod, bold is white.
<thelonecubone> Somasis: hate hi,
<thelonecubone> him*
<Somasis> and he's not from #bronymusic, he just does that spam thing there too
<NeX-x> Seriously?
<thelonecubone> uh
<Underpony> lol
<Somasis> he seems to do it more often there though
<thelonecubone> thats odd
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<Somasis> I'm not sure though
<twilight_squirtle> wait, white color isnt allowed? D:
<Somasis> I haven't been in here in a while
<twilight_squirtle> das raisin!
<twilight_squirtle> and we're all rule breakers too then
<Ryunosuke> dats wasist!
<otakon> twilight_squirtle: bold is considered white
<BlazeAngel> Somasis: No?
<Ryunosuke> :p
<Somasis> BlazeAngel, no about what?
<twilight_squirtle> otakon: but all our text is white
<thelonecubone> Somasis: sometimes he goes as Babseed and someother name. can't remember
<BlazeAngel> Somasis: Haven't been here ina while
<NeX-x> Every color is white on my end that doesn't reference me or staff abuse.
<otakon> hh
<AttackWithHugs> What's going on now?
<Somasis> yeah, he was in #bronystate as CutieMare some hours ago
<Somasis> I asked aji to kline him
<Derpy_Hooves> :3

<thelonecubone> Somasis: ikr
<thelonecubone> he does all the time
<NeX-x> Better than the GNAA.
<Somasis> basically just look for anyone that ends up with "ri.ri.cox.net" on the end of their host, and then pony_(numbers) as his ident and doesn't talk or anything
<Ryunosuke> hehe cox
<Somasis> his last whois gave me this: * [CutieMare] (pony_45768@jy65-3-357-38.ri.ri.cox.net): https://ponychat.net/

<MLP_Brovakiin> I have had a go at that guy many times in PM about it and his reasoning was that he is an attention whore :|
<BlazeAngel> ttention whore?
<NeX-x> Attention whore?

<gdlk_ouo> so crystal empire was banished in same time with luna?
<Rose`> there is no forgiveness for something like that SpadeKyurem
<Artifact> have you guys heard of the 4 player slendery game called survivor

<Cypresswolf|Cider> eeyup - *passes around cider*
<Bronysith> no
<Bronysith> no alchohol
<Artifact> SOMEONE ask aquestion so we can answer
<thelonecubone> D:
<Cypresswolf|Cider> Don't worry, its sparkling cider - non alcoholic :)
<jcelios> how does a scanning tunneling electron microscope work?
<Cypresswolf|Cider> Martinelli's
<gdlk_ouo> mm sweet cider... yeah sweet cider
<Artifact> jcelios: with its monkey
<StinkomanFan> QUESTION: Why is Twilight Purple?
<Dark_Horst> i'm cursed i'm telling ya. CURSED!
<jcelios> does the monkey need to be calibrated?
<Bronysith> in the script
<Bronysith> StinkomanFan: it is in the script
<alexxm> StinkomanFan because reasons
<gdlk_ouo> StinkomanFan, because she is Twilight Princess :)
<Artifact> shes cursed
<Bronysith> also purple is sexy...
<Bronysith> "cough"
<jcelios> StinkomanFan: In universe or out of universe?
<Punkie_Pue> Why is fluttershy yellow?
<Bronysith> cause yellow=urine
<Punkie_Pue> I don't follow.
<Dark_Horst> so i finally deduct that my hardware trouble roots in a broken hardrive. so today i got a new one. together with an OS on bootable disk someone was nice enough to burn me
<Artifact> beacuse shes bright like the sun:)
<Bronysith> yea but look at it too long and you go blind
<ZZZ> daaaaaaaaaw
<Dark_Horst> first thing i realize when i try to install it: mainbord is indeed fucked too
<Punkie_Pue> SHouldn't celestia be yellow too?
<Bronysith> nope
<Bronysith> shes fins how she is
<gdlk_ouo> Celestia should be purple...
<jcelios> Twilight should usurpe celestia
<Dark_Horst> so then i take this old spare, cobble it together.... and now for some reason it wont recognize any keybords. or mouses
<J_E_Smith71> Artifact: Twilight should be yellow then since she's the "bright"(smart) one of the group
<Dark_Horst> which worked yesterday
<Dark_Horst> it's like it WANTS to break all at once#+
<ZZZ> :'(D'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW
<Artifact> Why are celestia toys purple
<StinkomanFan> Another question: Yellow is the color of Fear, therefor shouldn't Apple Bloom be a deeper orange considering she's more brave than most of the ponies?
<Punkie_Pue> Why is Pinkie Pie pink lol?
<Dark_Horst> so yeah, in case any planetsiders are in here. could be a while til i'm with ya again
<gdlk_ouo> twilight purple because purple socks

<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1355182328300.jpg
<gdlk_ouo> why applejack always applejack?
<Dark_Horst> becasue applejack

<Dark_Horst> and the machine god hates me
<Punkie_Pue> I don't know, therefore applejack.
<jcelios> Do you think ponies have really good eye sight due to their giant eyes?
<ZZZ> luna daw:'(
<Punkie_Pue> I would think theyd have good night vision at least.
<Dark_Horst> if owls are any indicators, yes. damn good
<Artifact> She apple jacks
<Dark_Horst> also, did you notice how bright night in equestria always is?
<Dark_Horst> they show it through a pony's eyes
<Artifact> Dark_Horst: yeah lunas not good at her job
<jcelios> I thought it was all that cantorlot light pollution
<Punkie_Pue> Yes. The cameraman is a pony.

<StinkomanFan> QUESTION: Are Woona and Luna seperate entities?
<Bronysith> NewDCD: dat you?
<Dark_Horst> NewDCD: my laptop, harddrive, mainboard and periphery ports broke all in the course of 6 days. i outclass you
<Barbetos> Why is the silly picture so serious.

<Stormy> I'm here
<Stormy> Kinda
<Stormy> Tons of homework
<Bronysith> hes a good antagonist, he gets way too much hate
<ZZZ> we know
<Dark_Horst> i wont explain it in detail here now. that would take too long. in short: last week, laptop power inlet fired, sent to the workshop. then my mainboard and harddrive broke, presumably on the same day. and today the replacement hardware i found decided it doesnt want to recognize any input hardware anymore. so those ports are fucked too, it seems
<Stormy> I'm trying to help write a group paper while also working on another paper

<Dark_Horst> the rest is my pc
<Dark_Horst> so that's 2 computers broken right now

<Barbetos> Atleast not here, maybe in pms
<Dark_Horst> but hey, it's times like this when i'm lucky to be a gamestar reader. their hardware part has an interesting price/performance tip for cpu/mainboard/RAM sets
<MASF123> Haha well that makes me feel loads better!
<Barbetos> For the most part I won't care too personally.
<Barbetos> Just being honest.
<Barbetos> Would you rather me lie to you and feed you a bunch of crap?
<Dark_Horst> would cost about 300. should be aquirable
<MASF123> yeah you can be a dick all you want its cool
<Kimori> I'm kind of here too

<Barbetos> Whatever it is you will deal with it, just like all the other horrible crap that has happened.
<MASF123> Everything leads to a climax, Barbetos
<Barbetos> So. Deal with it.
<MASF123> All things must come to an end.
<Barbetos> Do you have issues with the end?
<Barbetos> It happens to everyone.
<StinkomanFan> IN BED
<MASF123> Yup I do.
<Barbetos> But I am not goign there.

<Bronysith> bronies are the worst...besides homestucks
<MASF123> Eh...I personally don't like cloppers.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02poniez o3o
<Bronysith> cloppers are a part of bronydom
<sub06905> dat SuperBrony64
<Irish_Pony> pft please Dr. Who is the worst fandom
<twilight_squirtle> ^
<DashWithRainbows> Excuse me, the brony who is both super and sixty-four years of age, it is time for bed.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat meh o3o
<twilight_squirtle> a show about time travel?? theyre totally ripping off doctor who!
<Scootaflew> :P
<MASF123> Bronysith: They are the ugly head of the fandom, but yes they are brony.
<BladedWings> ohai SuperBrony64 ^_^
<gdlk_ouo> dr. who fandom always stoned, so they don't care
*alexxm kidnaps and adopts Scootaflew
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai BladedWings :D
<Irish_Pony> Okay scartch that the COD fandom is the worst
<Punkie_Pue> :(
<Scootaflew> tries to fly away from alexxm. It's not very effective...
<gdlk_ouo> Halo fandom is the worst
<DashWithRainbows> Oi.
<MASF123> no....God of War are tight as hell about their fandom
<DashWithRainbows> Don't y'all be saying things like that, gdlk_ouo.
*alexxm hugs Scootaflew "i'm your daddy now
<MASF123> Halo fandom does suck too
<DashWithRainbows> We're better than the CoD community by far.
<Irish_Pony> All video game fandom is the worst fandom
<Scootaflew> Anyone have any idea when the next stream is?
<gdlk_ouo> lol
<Scootaflew> alexxm: o.o
<DashWithRainbows> Whenever a moderator feels like streaming, Scootaflew.
<alexxm> Scootaflew whenever the mods feel like it
<gdlk_ouo> CoD and Halo fandoms are same
<alexxm> whats the matter Scootaflew
<Scootaflew> Okay thanks
<Punkie_Pue> I think the cod fandom needs to be broken up into console and pc
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "we need offsite backups"
<DashWithRainbows> Actually gdlk_ouo, there are loads more kids in the CoD fandom.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "ok, ill set it up."
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> next month
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: aint that the truth
<Scootaflew> alexxm: PONYNAPPER
<Punkie_Pue> I find the pc community to be a lot more considerate than the console
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "what the hell we used 500gb of bandwidth last month thats insane why so much whats going on?"
<gdlk_ouo> well, maybe
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "you asked for offsite backups..."
<Irish_Pony> ^
<DashWithRainbows> That's because there are less kids, Punkie_Pue.
<Bronysith> i find fandoms to suck period
<Punkie_Pue> I know.
<alexxm> Scootaflew i didn't kidnap you i adopted you
<Irish_Pony> PC > Console
<Bronysith> there is no good fandom, just ones that are slightly more tolerable than the next one
<Punkie_Pue> ^
<Bronysith> Irish_Pony: fanboy get out
<Bronysith> there is no surperior system
<MASF123> I hate the TF2 community too, yet I love TF2
<Shizuka> 13GLORIOUS PC GAMING MASTER RACE BEGS TO DISAGREE

<Bronysith> Shizuka: but some of the best games of all time are on the console
<Bronysith> Irish_Pony: and ps3
<Bronysith> and ps2
<Bronysith> and original xbox
<Bronysith> and gamecube
<StinkomanFan> Shizuka! Stream something!
<Bronysith> and NES, SNES,
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: actually, there is. dependsw on which angle you look at it. in all things hardware, consoles are far behind modern gaming PCs
<MASF123> Dat true, Bronysith
<Shizuka> 13but dcd wants to stream
<Bronysith> and PS1
<Scootaflew> Anyone into gamecube?
<MASF123> I was
<Shizuka> 13Bronysith: and all of them can be played on PC now
<Scootaflew> N64?

<Punkie_Pue> ps1
<Irish_Pony> WiiU > Wii
<Shizuka> 13it's rule 34.c, if it exists, there is an emulator for it
<Dark_Horst> ^
<Punkie_Pue> lol
<MASF123> I hated PC gamers they always think they are best no matter what and that PC owns all consoles.
<Dark_Horst> MASF123: have you ever treid mouse?
<Irish_Pony> Shizuka and my mind went dirty
<Bronysith> Shizuka: nice, cause then i dont have to spend money on consoles and games to play, but i still respect the games that came out on these consoles
<DashWithRainbows> Shizuka So there is a Vivi wub emulator?
<MASF123> Dark_Horst: What is that I am new to this rat thing you call a mouse
<Shizuka> 13console lock-in isn't something to be proud of, considering how much consoles have been holding back the industry
<prince-dari> Eh, emulators rarely ever work well, unless on very old consoles.
<Shizuka> 13DashWithRainbows: what do you think i am >>
<Bronysith> cause Chrono trigger, final fantasy 6, persona 3, legend of dragoon,
<Punkie_Pue> My problem with consoles is they are just watered down pcs For the price, why not buy a pc?
<TheGentleManBrony> Hey Shizuka how do you like the snow?!?
<Bronysith> shadow of the colossus, prince of persia sands of time
<Scootaflew> I tell you, it's near impossible to find a good rom for the original super mario bros for NES
<Shizuka> 13hate snow
<StinkomanFan> Shizuka, I wanna ask. D'you have any of those old-timey point-'n-click aventure games?
<Shizuka> 13depends
<MASF123> Punkie_Pue: Agreed source games are like that all the time.
<Shizuka> 13if you mean myst yes
<MASF123> For consoles I mean
<prince-dari> And I couldn't tell you why, but nothing beats playing a game on it's original medium
<StinkomanFan> Like Police Quest or Monkey Island?
<Shizuka> 13no
<Ryunosuke> i prefer pc over consoles simply because of modding capabilities of games
<Shizuka> 13i do have freddi fish though
<DashWithRainbows> prince-dari because you get the hint of nostalgia?
<prince-dari> Playing pokemon blue on my gameboy colour just feels perfect.
<Irish_Pony> Shizuka how can you hate snow?!
<Scootaflew> My friend trolls me at duck hunt... He controls those ducks like its nobodies business...
<Bronysith> i just say, play games on whatever the fuck you prefer, if you have fun, then have some fucking fun, just dont try and shove it down my throat
<Punkie_Pue> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOlJixJAhPM

<Bronysith> Irish_Pony: you were pulling a fanboy shit earlier, so dont be a liar saying you agree with me
<Scootaflew> And build bunkers in
<MASF123> You tried concrete too?
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, that's funny when we have gaming discussion you seem to be offensive on different opinion
<TheGentleManBrony> We should get Jack T. Herbert on Bronystate.
<StinkomanFan> NewDCD, how could you stream a Manga?
<CriticKitten> I watch it, DCD. It's hilarious. XD
<ZZZ> over here it is snowing tomorow
<Dark_Horst> snow is nice. until you're 18 and have your drivers license. then you will hate snow too
<Bronysith> Irish_Pony: earlier you said "PC>consoles" so therefore you are being a lying sack of shit
<MASF123> Bronysith wtf
<Punkie_Pue> I haven't tried concrete, but i have tried asphault.
<MASF123> You mad tight
<twilight_squirtle> NewDCD: yeah it would be nice if you could stream it closer to friday, a lot of people who follow it arent here, prolly studying for exams

<Irish_Pony> Bronysith does it look like anyone else think that?
<prince-dari> To be honest the only one I really need to work hard for is physics
<Charger> That's why I dropped maths this year
<twilight_squirtle> prince-dari: i dont have the memory for chemistry.. i forget though, are you in high school or college?
<Dark_Horst> ZZZ: you're young. you're the focal point for incoming presents. you love christmas. when you're older though and that targeting changes, you too will learn the streass christmaas can bring with it
<prince-dari> Because I know none of the course and it is ridiculously hard compared to any other subject.

<Barbetos> Tabitha was also the old mare
<Barbetos> WHo wanted her horse shoe
<AttackWithHugs> Does this mean Shizuka will stream the crafting of mines today? :D

<Dark_Horst> TheGentleManBrony: slowpoke meme. you might want to look that up
<Shizuka> 13scrcap is more useful for video streams
<Bronysith> but Shizuka streams her pc games
<Vordox> Shizuka: You're gonna stream?=3
<RaveBrony> TheGentleManBrony: Yeah, Tabitha wasnt fully in the "Luna" zone at the start, but she got into it by the end of the ep.
<Bronysith> baldurs gate is overrated
