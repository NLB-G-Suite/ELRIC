<Dashite> Silvermane they weren't thinking and not soon enough.
*Denied_Existence slashes at D_man with the particle sword!
<Dashite> Did that plane just punch a robot?
*D_man 0is flung back a few hundred meters, his sword shattering in his hand. He gets up, blood falling from his forehead. "damn!"
<NewDCD> 9technically it's not a plane, it's a Gunman
*Denied_Existence fires a Nuclear tipped cruise missile at D_man!
*D_man 0holds up the shattered sword and points it directly at denied_existence, parallel to the floor, and charges.
<D_man> 0"HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU....."
<D_man> 0"BAN.........KAI!"
<Light_Latias> 12...?
<Dashite> Oh ma gawd.
*Denied_Existence readies his blade to deflect the incoming attack!
*D_man 0dissapears from view, a huge explosion being seen in his wake from the misile.
<Dashite> Celestia clones.
<NewDCD> 9...you ought to be kicked for invoking that.
*D_man 0appears behind deniec_existence and charges.
<D_man> 0"HIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa!"
<Caaz> CaitSith_!
<Caaz> ARE YOU BLACK?
<Ascendant> lol I don't think anyone reads the motd
<Ascendant> I sure as hell don't
<Caaz> Important question, we're talking about you.
<Ascendant> it's seriously tl;dr
*Denied_Existence is struck in the back by D_man! He is flung several hundred feet away!
<Ascendant> then again, most rules/tos/whatever pages fall into the tl;dr category
*Denied_Existence turns around and fires a burst at D_man from the MAG.
<D_man> 0hah, and I was going for an epic sword on sword clash, hence why i am still charging. still, to go along with this
*D_man 0can be seen with a Black Kusari-Gama - His Bankai. He spins the blade at the end of the chain (google it) in front of him. "Damn! can't hold 'em all off!" some bullets get past and tear through his clothes.
*Ascendant rants on some more
<NewDCD> 9>Bankai
<NewDCD> 9.____:
<Dragoran> o_O
<D_man> 0NewDCD first 3 seasons. 5 episodes into season 4 and I quit, but first 3 seasons. WOW!
*Denied_Existence ignites the beam of his sword, readying for the charging D_man
<NewDCD> 9Bleach became shit when the Rescue Rukia arc started.
<Denied_Existence> "You should have taken the time to build a mech foal!"
<NewDCD> 9jus' sayin', it's everything wrong with the industry
*D_man 0charges at Denied_Existence, spinning and flipping in the air, the blade on the chain flying in all directions. Finally, he does a huge flip, the chain coming from behind, over his head, and toward Denied_existence. "I DON'T NEED A MECH!"
<NewDCD> 9same with Naruto
<GGgala> ohai Polarfire
<D_man> 0I know i know
<NewDCD> 9One Piece is acceptable, but overrated
<D_man> 0I just liked it
<Polarfire> ohai everyone. sorry haven't been paying attention to chat, kinda busy
<NewDCD> 9my advice: quit halfway through Hueco Mundo. It goes FULL STUPID nearing the end.
*Denied_Existence attempts to stab upwards at D_man
<NewDCD> 9I was like "fuck this shit I ain't reading no more"
<D_man> 0NewDCD lol. i am strugglin' through (i mean 2 years of strugglin' lol) seasons 4 and 5
<NewDCD> 9also sup Polarfire
<D_man> 0Sure Polarfire. What you busy with?
<NewDCD> 9also skip the filler if you're watching the anime, from what i hear it's massively bleh
<Polarfire> ohai DCD :D and Dman too
<Denied_Existence> Hi
*D_man 0swings downwards. The two blades collide, giving off a loud thundershock and sparks flying everywhere.
<Denied_Existence> aswell
*D_man 0lands on the sword, looks up, through the blood on his face, through the panel at Denied_Existence. He jumps off the sword at Denied_existence...
<D_man> 0Polarfire what u busy with? anything we can help with?
*Denied_Existence fiddles desperately with controls in his cockpit.
*NewDCD 9out of fucking nowhere
<Polarfire> oh naah my car broke down today. Just doing some research on how to fix it. Thanks anyway though :)
*D_man 0's Face clenches, eyebrows lowering, while still flying toward Denied_existence...
<D_man> 0ah ok then polarfire
*NewDCD 9uses Attack Ride: Illusion > Kamen Ride: Kuuga > Attack Ride: Mighty Kick
*NewDCD 9nukes D_man
<NewDCD> 9and that's for using Bankai.
*Denied_Existence winces as the detonation obliterates D_man!
*D_man 0is flung to the right of denied_existence, creating a crater about 400 meters away. "W-What..." he says as he gets up, "What the HELL?!?"
*Denied_Existence and his mech are flung a kilometer backwards!
<NewDCD> 9kay, bye
<D_man> 0"GET BACK HERE!"
*NewDCD 9uses Attack Ride: Invisible and fades from view.
<D_man> 0also newdcd - a kusarigama as an ultimate weapon - what's not to LOVE?
*Denied_Existence gets up, his mech damaged due to the blast.
<NewDCD> 9the fact it originated from one of the most suretell signs of Bleach's stagnation?
*D_man 0is struggling to get up
<NewDCD> 9It was a great series right until it went to Rescue Rukia
<D_man> 0NewDCD whaaaaaaa
*Denied_Existence detects D_man's life signs and fires another nuclear tipped cruise missile at him.
<Polarfire> Hey DCD I've got something I think you might like.
<D_man> 0"No...!"
<NewDCD> 9sure thing Polarfire, well, shoot
<Polarfire> http://pastebin.com/qhuJQ1Ym
<D_man> 0polarfire 0______________0
<NewDCD> 9I expected that
<NewDCD> 9Y U show me ur porn stash
*Denied_Existence 's NTCM airbursts mere feet above D_man's head!
<Polarfire> Actually, credit for finding that goes to rainbro.
<GGgala> dat pastebin
<NewDCD> 9it originated here, somewhat.
<NewDCD> 9I blame Bjornfot's uncontrolled sexual urges
<D_man> 0"Damn! Too close! Now what! Think, D man, Think!"
<Polarfire> lol
*D_man 0barely manages to stand up, waddling a little to the side, his kusarigama in one hand
<Polarfire> I didn't know anything about a part 2 until rainbrodash told me about it.
*Denied_Existence decides that he should attempt to take out NewDCD, as he is the most obvious threat.
<Dermathil> OH F NO MORE?
<NewDCD> 9>implying I'm anywhere around
<NewDCD> 9>Implying I'm going to get involved with either of you
*Denied_Existence begins looking for NewDCD
<NewDCD> 9just run along and do your stuff.
<Denied_Existence> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/115.png
*D_man 0takes a few steps forward, almost falling over, head looking down.
*Denied_Existence returns to base to repair and re-arm.
<D_man> 0hey there Ghosties!
<Denied_Existence> OHai Ghosties
<Ghosties> 4Hey
<ValtheJean> howdy Ghosties

<NewDCD> 9*Chapter
<D_man> 0Denied_existence I guess we're done? *Brohoof* Let's do this again some time
<Denied_Existence> Sure.
*D_man 0walks the long walk to Denied_existence's base, enters, and holds out a fist.
<SilverMane> so i just printed Double rainbow and Of Mares and Magic. only 105 pages, with text size changes
*Denied_Existence brohoofs D_man.
<GGgala> Ghosties you're alive! you gave me and Polarfire an awesome idea with that Red Spy incident monday
*D_man 0Brofists Denied_Existence. "Heh, and you almost had me!"
<Ghosties> 4What happened on Monday?
<Denied_Existence> Almost, you should have gotten a mech, you might have had a better chance.
<Polarfire> an epic RP.
<D_man> 0I really should shouldn't I?
<Denied_Existence> Yes.
<Ghosties> 4? Okay
<D_man> 0but the time you spent building yours I spent reading fics
<Polarfire> It was great.
<NewDCD> 9DYNAMIC. KILL.
<D_man> 0lol
<Dermathil> OMFG AT CRIT DMG
<Dermathil> 11K
<Denied_Existence> ITS OVER 9000!!!!!!

<D_man> 0THE SPY'S A DOUBLE AGENT!
<Polarfire> umm
*Denied_Existence lights Polarfire on fire!
<Denied_Existence> GODDDAMN SPY!
*Polarfire burns
<D_man> 0lol
<Ghosties> 4What was going on Monday, because I don't remember >_>
*Polarfire gets extra crispy
<GGgala> lol that was everything you would remember
<Denied_Existence> Well...I wasn't here...
<Denied_Existence> Yummmy
<GGgala> it's what happened after that that got epic
<D_man> 0WTF! it's 6am! How did I lose track of time so badly!
<Ghosties> 4I mean, what was streaming
<D_man> 0I should go to bed
*Denied_Existence feeds Polarfire jerky to his dogs.
<GGgala> I think the stream was dead at the time, I missed it
<Ghosties> 4Huh
<GGgala> hence the RP.
*Denied_Existence grabs GGgala!
<GGgala> i saved the log--i should post it?
<GGgala> hey!
*Denied_Existence throws GGgala into the RPmachine!
<D_man> 0:O
*Denied_Existence turns the RPmachine on!
*GGgala is not familiar with this machien
<Ghosties> 4Sure?
<Dermathil> FRIENDSHIP ATTACK
<Ghosties> 4I guess, GGgala
<Ghosties> 4It'd jog my memory, I'm sure
*Denied_Existence says, "Now I get to find out what this machine does exactly!"
*Polarfire wonders if he is allowed to come back after being turned into jerky and fad to the dogs >_>
*Denied_Existence clones Polarfire.
<Denied_Existence> It looks like you
<Denied_Existence> *sunglasses*
<Denied_Existence> Were quite a jerk...
<Polarfire> *facehoof*
<D_man> 0Ok i g2sleep. Night, Denied_existence, that was fun, we should do it again sometime. Night Silvermane, valtheJean, Dermathil and GGgala too =]

<NewDCD> 9well
<Ghosties> 4Sorry, my net went stupid
<GGgala> just in case of epicness
<NewDCD> 9that's an error I did not expect
<NewDCD> 9gimme a sec
<Ghosties> 4CHATCEPTION
<Ghosties> 4A small taste of what's to come tomorrow?
<ValtheJean> dun dun duunnnnnnn
<NewDCD> 9there we go
<NewDCD> 9sorry for the inconvenience
<Chimera> 04bbl or bye
*ValtheJean is happy to see exploding robot dinosaurs again :P
<NewDCD> 9give me amoment
<NewDCD> 9I'd like to fix the quality
<ValtheJean> s'all good bro
<GGgala> not sure if you got it Ghosties - you're The Guy Who Dies At the Start: http://pastebin.com/5K1v40q0
<NewDCD> 9fixed
<NewDCD> 9stream is now live
<HSX> Nya
<Ghosties> 4OH
<Ghosties> 4Now I remember
<Ghosties> 4I logged in real quick to see what was going on
<Ghosties> 4And said that
<Ghosties> 4Now I remember
<SilverMane> wait what is that story GGgala?
<Ghosties> 4It occurred this past Monday night when I logged into Brony State really late
<ValtheJean> wait...
<ValtheJean> does that robot have a gun for it's epeen?
<NewDCD> 9nah
<Ghosties> 4I said "There's a red spy in Brony Stat (minus the e, because I wasn't paying attention)" and it spawned a RP
<NewDCD> 9it's not a robot, and that's not a gun
<SilverMane> night everyone. Polarfire. we're going to meet up during BMN tomorrow, between 7-8 EST. I'll get your character sheet finished with you, and you can join us all. we probably won't play due to sexy movie time, but we can talk and discuss a pony game .night all
<ValtheJean> O_o
<Polarfire> Ok sounds great. Thanks Silver
<Polarfire> yup pretty much ghosties. :D too bad you didn't stick around. It was pretty great
<Ghosties> 4I did my part, then you all did yours
<Polarfire> lol yup :)
<GGgala> the Dead Guy role is a very important role
<Polarfire> ^
<GGgala> in retrospect i like the part where we extrapolated a plot point from the chat-equivalent of an animation error
<Dermathil> dynamic kill?
<ValtheJean> that bitch just exploded
<ValtheJean> lol...I have no idea how these mechanics work
<ValtheJean> but damn it those explosion scenes are entertaining
<NewDCD> 9Dynamic Kills are when the "death" explosions are part of the enemy's attack animation instead of their own standard, standoalone animation...like just now.
<Dermathil> nice
<ValtheJean> yeah! Use viewtiful joe!
<Dermathil> who?
<ValtheJean> wait...that's not viewtiful!
<NewDCD> 9he means GodMars
<ValtheJean> where's the Viewtiful Joe bot???
<NewDCD> 9yeah, he just combined into the bigass robot he's supposed to be
<ValtheJean> nooooooooo!
<ValtheJean> poor Viewtiful...he lived such a great life
<NewDCD> 9technically he can de-dock?
<Dermathil> dat dodge animation
<ValtheJean> lol
<Dermathil> eeyup
<Dermathil> BELLY BUTTON LAZ0R
<Polarfire> ohai fffffffffffffffffff
<ValtheJean> I wanna see another one of those big dramatic scenes where there's like 20 people and the captain or whatever screams something at them
<ValtheJean> and then que giant beam of friendship
*Dermathil prefers the more mechlike mechs like this one.
<NewDCD> 9The Macross F isn't the battleship for this route
<NewDCD> 9so yeah
<ValtheJean> wait...
<ValtheJean> Macross
<Polarfire> welp, he left.
<ValtheJean> as in ROBOTECH?
<NewDCD> 9more mechlike mechs are considered "Real Robots", who are often some sort of military hardware
<ValtheJean> I LOVED THAT SHOW WHEN I WAS A KID
<GGgala> lol fffffffffffffffffff
<NewDCD> 9Super Robots, like Gurren Lagann, are...yeah, Macross F
<NewDCD> 9but the Valkyries/Veritechs of the F SUCK in this game
<NewDCD> 9so I don't use them
<Dermathil> yeah. I prefer the real robots
<Dermathil> by like a mile.
<NewDCD> 9I love both
<ValtheJean> I liked the veritechs :(
<NewDCD> 9some Supers have much crazier attacks though
<NewDCD> 9and that is fun
<ValtheJean> the original Robotech was so wonderful
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (drfsupercenter10) 11WB10»11•. 10- [09:03] <HyperMetalLugia> What else does she own that's yours? [09:04] <%drfsupercenter> HyperMetalLugia, that's private
<NewDCD> 9techincally, the original MACROSS
<NewDCD> 9the Macekreisms of the show were the bad thing about Robotech
<NewDCD> 9have you watched Macross: Do You Remember Love?
<ValtheJean> don't think so
<NewDCD> 9Go watch it
<NewDCD> 9go watch it right now
<ValtheJean> but but...exploding robot dinosaurs!
<NewDCD> 9dude, Do You Remember Love is an alternate telling of the events of the first series
<NewDCD> 9coupled with BEAUTIFUL ANIMATION and much better pilot suit designs
<ValtheJean> hmmm
<NewDCD> 9actually, according to Macross Canon
<NewDCD> 9neither series are "canon" tellings of what happened during the first Space War
<NewDCD> 9basically, both the TV show and movie are different "documentaries" of the same events
<ValtheJean> interesting
<ValtheJean> but I think we can all agree that the Russian Captain was by far the sexiest character :P
<GGgala> so the shows are both told by an unreliable narrator?
<GGgala> s/narrator/animator-producer-etc/
<NewDCD> 9somewhat. More like "inexactitudes of history"
<NewDCD> 9also, watched Macross Plus?
<Chimera> Mew
<NewDCD> 9DAT DYNAMIC KILL
<ValtheJean> I haven't seen anything of the series outside of what I watched as a kid
<Dermathil> nope, DCD
<NewDCD> 9well
<NewDCD> 9there's your homework
<Dermathil> wasn't dynamic
<ValtheJean> lol
<NewDCD> 9it was
<Dermathil> what? We saw him blow up normal at the end
<ValtheJean> it's 3 weeks before I go back to college, and I already have homework :P
<NewDCD> 9The "BEING DRAGGED AND EXPLODING" part of the animation is reserved for dynamic kills
<Dermathil> ah
<NewDCD> 9it just doesn't end like a dynamic kill should, that's all
<NewDCD> 9but basically any piece of animation reserved for when the attack lands a kill = dynamic kill
<ValtheJean> anyone ever play that PS2 Game Robotech Battlecry?
<NewDCD> 9that's probably a better explanation, isn't it?
<Dermathil> yeah
<ValtheJean> lol
<ValtheJean> that sounded like they said "gokaiger"
<GGgala> stream interrupt for anyone else?
<ValtheJean> nope
<GGgala> ah. it keeps happening to me
<ValtheJean> man...why doesn't Japan port these games in English?
<ValtheJean> I would totally buy it if it were translated
<NewDCD> 9Val: because so many animus = HUGE LICENSING COSTS OH GOD
<NewDCD> 9as well as niche fanbase
<ValtheJean> stupid American taxes...
<NewDCD> 9basically
<NewDCD> 9as awesome as it is
<NewDCD> 9it wouldn't sell enough
<NewDCD> 9to warrant it considering the costs
<ValtheJean> yeah but, I know next to nothing about this series/universe, yet I'd buy this game based on the gameplay I've seen
<GGgala> how does it sell in Japan then?
<Dermathil> any fandub?
<NewDCD> 9they have actually brought a few of these, though....the Original Generations ones, that is
<ValtheJean> and I'd bet there's a larger audience than they expect
<NewDCD> 9Gala: like hotcakes
<NewDCD> 9Dermathil: a few are fan translated. SRW J for GBA and SRW Alpha for PSOne
<NewDCD> 9I'd recommend starting with J
<NewDCD> 9there are many SRW games translation projects because this series is very popular
<ValtheJean> yeah...so I'm required to take a foreign language as a major requirement...I'm taking Japanese so I can play these damn games
<Dermathil> >MFW Gba game
<Dermathil> DO WANT
<NewDCD> 9give me a moment
<Ziltoid> Theres this mech game where you could customize and fight in an arena
<Ziltoid> it was on gamecube
<ValtheJean> Mechwarrior?
<Ziltoid> I cant remeber the game
<ValtheJean> oh, Gamecube
<Ziltoid> no
<NewDCD> 9http://www.mediafire.com/?r9bbh3n8d7bb7sn Patched and uploaded by yours truly
<ValtheJean> Mechwarrior was an old PC game :P
<Dermathil> :DDD
<Dermathil> THANKS DCD
<ValtheJean> normally I'd say something about copyright infringement
*Dermathil needs a GBA emulator
<ValtheJean> but suddenly I don't care
<NewDCD> 9also
<ValtheJean> Virtual GBA is good
<NewDCD> 9play at 2x or 3x size with the corresponding HQ Filter
<NewDCD> 9for prettier graphics
<Dermathil> alright
<ValtheJean> oh damn it
<NewDCD> 9also brace for awesome plot
<ValtheJean> my gba emulator is on my other computer
<ValtheJean> grrrr
<Dermathil> lolol
<NewDCD> 9because SRWs are always great on plot
<NewDCD> 9too bad we can't understand most of it
<Ziltoid> dat plot
<Dermathil> someone needs to fandub this game
<NewDCD> 9Fun DCD Trivia: SEED Destiny was a terrible series. However, how SRW Z handled it was SO GOOD, that most people take its version of the events as the canon one. This makes the talentless hack of a director buttfrustrated to no end.
<ValtheJean> lol
<Dermathil> lolololol
<Dermathil> is there also a PS1 emulator while we're at it?
<NewDCD> 9ePSXe
<ValtheJean> Epsxe
<NewDCD> 9or a PSP
<ValtheJean> awww
<ValtheJean> whore :P
<Dermathil> I ain't got no PS console

<GGgala> paid for by the "NewDCD's future 6-stars rating council"?
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Drake03)02WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
<Umbreon> 12dwakkkkkkkkke
<ValtheJean> NewDCD doesn't bookmark EQ, like a baws
<Drake> 04Boo muthafuggas
<Dermathil> Wait, how do I install the emulator from the .zip?
<Drake> 04BREEEE
<Drake> 04It's good to be back
<ValtheJean> it's just an exe
<ValtheJean> no installing
<Umbreon> 12yes it is
<Umbreon> 12hi
<Dermathil> well from where I dl
<GGgala> whoo Antipodes update
<Dermathil> it was in .zip
<Dermathil> yes GGgala
<drfsupercenter> 03watch your language
<NewDCD> 9technically I got a story with 6 stars
<NewDCD> 9but it's not Wyburn
<NewDCD> 9Wyburn is rated pretty low...I think there were some people that downgraded stories labeled "Grimdark" going around at the time though
<Aurora> yeah that was weird..
<NewDCD> 9because this was around the time when everyone flipped their shit due to Cupcakes...I THINK.
<NewDCD> 9might be mixing up the events
<NewDCD> 9but I'm pretty sure I got some random "1" votes
<GGgala> in mid-march?
<Glacymr> 12.......
<Glacymr> 12where is Aurora's mod
<GGgala> i thought Cupcakes was older
<NewDCD> 9lemme see...
<LL-XBL> 12hiding
<ValtheJean> it was something like a week or so before party of one
<ValtheJean> cupcakes that is
<GGgala> >mfw i'm unsurprised at saddlesore fanfic police
<NewDCD> 9yeah, March
<NewDCD> 9let me check when did Party of One got released...
<Drake> 04I'm just happy I'm back
<Drake> 04so
<Drake> 04boo
<Glacymr> 12that's my line
<GGgala> late april
<Dermathil> How do I put HD settings on the GBA emulator?
<GGgala> second-to-last episode, finale was beginning of may, so
<ValtheJean> delete system 32
<NewDCD> 9April...hmm
<Ziltoid> clopfic reading time?
<NewDCD> 9Dermathil: There should be a "window size" option around
<Ziltoid> yesssssssssssssssss
<NewDCD> 9choose the multiplier
<GGgala> All of my money
<NewDCD> 9then find the "filters"
<NewDCD> 9and select the one matching the size you changed your window to
<NewDCD> 9otherwise it will look terrible
<ValtheJean> gasp
<ValtheJean> you ez torrenting inception
<NewDCD> 9but yeah
<ValtheJean> for shame :P
<NewDCD> 9I think it was around the time
<NewDCD> 9oh look
<NewDCD> 9I forgot to turn off the stream
<NewDCD> 9well
<NewDCD> 9as I said
<NewDCD> 9I'm poor
<ValtheJean> lol
<ValtheJean> I've got nothing against pirating from the people who made Inception :P
<Dashite> You mean you don't legally acquire all the movies for movie night?! :O
<GGgala> okay, cupcakes was posted to EqD on Feb 24th, and the post implied it had been around a while
<Dashite> My whole worlds has been shattered!
<ValtheJean> Feb 24th really? wow
<Dashite> I... I thought you were better than that NewDCD! :(
<Dermathil> >I hate the Inception haters. The movie is good if you watch it again!
<Dermathil> If you watch it again it makes more sense!
<ValtheJean> >the movie is shit if you watch it again* fixed :P
<ValtheJean> you misunderstand
<GGgala> i have no feelings on inception whatsoever
<Dermathil> GRRRR
<ValtheJean> I don't hate it because I don't understand it
<GGgala> and i watched it twice
<ValtheJean> I hate it because it's a farce trying to be artistic and deep
<ValtheJean> when in reality it's just a waste of money
<GGgala> i can go either way. i can't decide if it's lulz in a good way or a bad way
<Dermathil> It is still way better than most blockbusters out there (TRANSFORMERS)
<Dashite> Anything is better than transfomers.
<Dermathil> (all the shitty romance movies)
<ValtheJean> well saying a polished turd is better than a turd isn't much
<ValtheJean> it's still a turd
<ValtheJean> heh...that was a quote from one of my teachers actually
<Dashite> What if that turd is a really shiny polished sphere?
<GGgala> it's extremely retro scifi -- almost no characterization next to a mountain of world-building
<Dermathil> >mfw you'll be insulting The Dark Knight next
<ValtheJean> it's still a turd
<ValtheJean> why would I hate Dark Knight?
<Dashite> The Dark Knight is overrated.
<Dermathil> ValtheJean: Christopher Nolan
<Dermathil> He made both movies
<ValtheJean> so?
<Dermathil> Inception was his idea
<ValtheJean> Spielburg made Jurassic Park...he also made Indiana Jones 4
<Ghosties> 4Hey!
<Ghosties> 4The Dark Knight was a great movie
<Ghosties> 4Shut up
<Dashite> I never said it was bad, just that it was overrated.
<Ghosties> 4overrated implies it's not as good as it's made out to be
<Ghosties> 4Which is negative
<Dermathil> ^^
<Ghosties> 4which = bad
<Dashite> It's not the second coming of cinema jesus that people made it out to be.
*VioletVanilla giggles at the Ghosties
<Dermathil> Ghosties, wanna use the lawnchair?
<Ghosties> 4That would be The Passion of the Christ
<ValtheJean> ung...
<Dashite> :/
<Dermathil> (I can lend it to you for Violet's case)
<GGgala> BDSM Jesus?
<Ghosties> 4Look, I'm not saying Dark Knight IS THE BEST MOVIE EVAR but it's really one of the best hero movies created
<VioletVanilla> What do I have to do with Lawn Chairs?
<ValtheJean> I would certainly say it's the best of the comic book hero movies
<VioletVanilla> Dark Knight is a great movie. . .
<VioletVanilla> and Dark Knight Rises is going to be cool~
<Ghosties> 4Eh
<Ghosties> 4Don't get me started on DKR
<ValtheJean> I'm assuming that's the planned sequel for it?
<VioletVanilla> @ValtheJean You sure you don't want to watch Elektra with me? ;D
<Ghosties> 4Why Nolan couldn't just sign Depp on to do The Riddler is beyond me
<Dermathil> Val, that's the ANNOUNCED sequel
<Dermathil> not just planned.
<VioletVanilla> Because Depp is too busy with Tim Burton o.o
<ValtheJean> @VioletVanilla wait...what?
<ValtheJean> Elektra?
<GGgala> Elektra? sure is troll in here
<Ghosties> 4Depp wanted to do Riddler last I recall
<Ghosties> 4But oh well
<VioletVanilla> Elektra = WORST comic book hero movie ever according to everyone. . .
<NewDCD> 9I am of the opinion we gotta watch something before we get an opinion on stuff
<ValtheJean> oh...I thought you were being serious
*VioletVanilla gives a cookie to GGgala
<ValtheJean> didn't notice the ";D"
<VioletVanilla> Oh well, if you want to come over that's fine too. . .
<VioletVanilla> I just made fresh cookies
<Dashite> What is this "watch stuff before you judge it" bullshit?! This is the internet! We don't do that around here!
<GGgala> omnom
<VioletVanilla> Though I have work in a couple of hours so you better hurry! ;3
<VioletVanilla> @Dashite: Exactly.
<GGgala> but then other people will be like "if you hate it so much why are you watching it"!
<VioletVanilla> @GGgala: Double exactly!
<VioletVanilla> Forever ashamed if you watch something stupid. . .
<GGgala> and then the "it's not FOR you" crowd will join in...
<VioletVanilla> XD
<Dakota> AAAAAH! Oh, I'm talking to myself. Nice.
<VioletVanilla> YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND, IT'S AN ACQUIRED TASTE
<ValtheJean> maybe, but my point of view is right ;)
<GGgala> "you're too elitist/not elite enough to enjoy it!"
<Aurora> what do you mean where's my mod
<NewDCD> 9WELP
<Aurora> I imagined gary's mod there
<Aurora> lol
<NewDCD> 9Seems I'll have to draw a picture for Wyburn's next update
<Glacymr> 12i thought Aurora had op
<Drake> 04o-o
<Dakota> Oh. Hi, Aurora.
*Glacymr talks about Aurora in 3rd person for the fun of it
<VioletVanilla> :3 I wanna see pishure~
<Dakota> Yay! I'm not talking to myself anymore!
<Dermathil> >MFW I discover all the mech pilots are teens and not professional adults.
<NewDCD> 9well
<Dermathil> Who still got school
<NewDCD> 9I have some working designs here...
<NewDCD> 9Dermathil: not all of them
<Dashite> School is over yo.
<GGgala> >excused from school forever for saving the world
<Dermathil> Beginning the first mission of J
*Drake pokes Dakota
<Drake> 04Are you new?
<Dermathil> EVERYTHING I SEE ARE STUDENTS RAAAG
<Dakota> Who here thinks Spongebob is stupid and evil?
<NewDCD> 9oh
<NewDCD> 9that
<Drake> 04Just out of curiosity, since I've never seen your name here.
<NewDCD> 9LOL
<Drake> 04BLASPHEMY
<Drake> 04SACRILEGE
<ValtheJean> oh man
<Dakota> Oh, I am new.
<Drake> 04I DECLARE HOLY WAR AGAINST YOU AND YOUR KIND
<ValtheJean> all of this robot fighting and whatnot
*Dermathil has no idea what he is doing in that game
<Drake> 04WE ARE AT WAAAAAAAR
<ValtheJean> we should totally get a BMN stream of a Supreme Commander battle royale
<Drake> 04*ahem* No I don't think it's stupid and evil.
<VioletVanilla> O:
<VioletVanilla> SUPREME COMMANDER
<Dakota> But Spongebob is a freaky little dude. *shivers at the thought of him*
<VioletVanilla> I WILL GO AGAINST YOU ALL
<Dashite> I'll just be in my little corner down here.
<Dermathil> >Mfw Total Annihilation should be better
<ValtheJean> lol
<Dermathil> Or the free remake
<Drake> 04It's extremely childish and the humour could use some work here and there, but it's still an amusing show and there is a reason it's such a juggernaut for Nickelodeon's ratings.
<Dashite> I'm totally not building anything!
<NewDCD> 9gaze at DCD's terribad drawfag skills http://time-diver.deviantart.com/#/d3es186
<ValtheJean> hey, Total Annihilation was a solid game
<VioletVanilla> Anyone have Command and Conquers? ;D
<Aurora> bree
*Dashite hides his under construction Mavor
<Aurora> I haven't been admin for months..
<Dakota> Ever been to Nickalodeon resorts?
<Glacymr> 12nick doesn't really have anythings
<Dashite> VioletVanilla, only all of them.
<Aurora> I gave it up remember?
<Glacymr> 12no i don't
<Dashite> Wait, that's not true.
<VioletVanilla> @DASHITE I CHALLENGE YOU TO A COMP STOMP
<Drake> 04No I haven't
<Dermathil> I ain't saying anything against TA.
<Dashite> I don't have Sole Survivor.
<Dermathil> I LOVE TA.
<Drake> 04hi
<Dermathil> There's even a free remake out there somewhere.
<Glacymr> 12i've been to the mall of america
<VioletVanilla> I WILL SHOW YOU HOW A WOMAN HANDLES MICROMANAGEMENT
<Glacymr> 12if that counts
<ValtheJean> angry much?
<Dermathil> called Spring
<Dakota> well, Nickalodeon has people dressed up as Dora walking around, and Dora is EVIL!
<VioletVanilla> Total Annihilation is alright. . .
<Dashite> :p
<Glacymr> 12i did not see that
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<Dermathil> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_%28game_engine%29
<ValtheJean> why bother a remake of TA? It has several mods plus Supreme Commander is an unofficial sequel
<Dashite> Dark Reighn bitches!
<Drake> 04Take care what you call 'evil'
<VioletVanilla> It's very outdated though. . .
<Dashite> Gah, Dark Reign.
<Dermathil> ValtheJean: well, updated engines, etc?
<ValtheJean> I think it still holds
<Glacymr> 12nothing is evil
<VioletVanilla> ^ As ValtheJean said
<Glacymr> 12not even justin bieber and rebecca black
<ValtheJean> I mean, the modding community for TA is STILL going
<Dakota> Ever seen the video called "Dora the Murderer"?
<HyperMetalLugia> Except ketchup bottles
<VioletVanilla> Well, that's not saying too much. . .
<ValtheJean> it's still a very strong community
<VioletVanilla> The modding community for Half Life is still going. . .
<VioletVanilla> and that's like. . .
<VioletVanilla> The modding community for the original DOOM is still going stong. . . x.x
<ValtheJean> the modding community for half life pales in comparison to the TA
<Dermathil> yeah.
<Dermathil> Just look up Complete Annihilation or Balanced Annihilation for idea.
<Drake> 04Nope @Dakota
<Dakota> Dude, I just had a weird thought about a Shadow Lugia. It has a red horn and is creepy.
<Polarfire> hey DCD that looks pretty good
<ValtheJean> >suddenly has immense amounts of nostalgia
<GGgala> one of these days i gotta get Half-Life so i can play the mod /Natural Selection/
<Drake> 04brb installing AoM
<ValtheJean> tis a good mod
<VioletVanilla> Natural Selection
<GGgala> which i've heard such great things about
<VioletVanilla> Very good mod
<NewDCD> 9the designs in the right are working designs for Kamen Rider Spike
<NewDCD> 9so yeah
<VioletVanilla> Terrible players
<VioletVanilla> x.x
<Dakota> Watch it. It's pretty rediculous. (I spelled that wrong, didn't I?)
<ValtheJean> lol
<ValtheJean> fair enough
<ValtheJean> Synergy was a really fun HL2 mod...for a while at least
<VioletVanilla> I played it about three weeks ago. . .
<Polarfire> DCD that's awesome :D
<GGgala> isn't there a half-life mod where you seem to be playing someone who's locked up in a hospital hallucinating the zombies?
<VioletVanilla> GGgala: Probably. . .
<VioletVanilla> XD
<Dermathil> AIR RAID SIREN
<ValtheJean> I wouldn't be surprised
<Dermathil> (in the gba port)
<Drake> 04Ridiculous*
<Dakota> Okay, that creepy Shadow Lugia just keeps popping up in my head...*shivers*
<ValtheJean> you know, WC3 had a really good modding community
<VioletVanilla> @Dashite Where you go? ):
<ValtheJean> it's a shame blizzard killed the universe with WoW
<VioletVanilla> x.x
<Dakota> Thanks, Drake.
<VioletVanilla> WC3
<Drake> 04A shadow lugia with a red horn? Is the horn on the back of it's head or on it's snout?
<ValtheJean> then again
<Dashite> I'm right here.
<VioletVanilla> WAS MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD RTS aside from C&C and Starcraft
<ValtheJean> DotA killed everything that was good about WC3
<Dakota> My cat is going beserks.
<ValtheJean> stupid fucking DotA
<VioletVanilla> ValtheJean: true story~
<ValtheJean> I wish it had never been made...
<Dashite> I never got into WC3.
<SilverSonic> i'm back from being afk ;o
<Dashite> I hated the heroes.
<ValtheJean> it was a pretty solid game
<ValtheJean> I can understand that
<ValtheJean> personally I liked it because it was just a more organized micro management
<VioletVanilla> @Dashite Check PM's mister! D<
<Dermathil> who the hell is Ja-Mu?
<VioletVanilla> It was a good blend is what it was. . .
<Drake> 04wb
<SilverSonic> thanks
<VioletVanilla> It blended micromanagement but wasn't like
<ValtheJean> Starcraft levels? :P
<VioletVanilla> UNIVERSE AT WAR
<VioletVanilla> Well, that too. . .
<ValtheJean> I played Starcraft for the melee games, I played Warcraft III for the custom maps and the story
<ValtheJean> unfortunately...it seems that only Starcraft has kept the story part
<ValtheJean> here's to hoping the next Starcraft game isn't an MMO
<VioletVanilla> Starcraft 2. . .
<VioletVanilla> <3
<VioletVanilla> AND THEN
<VioletVanilla> EVERYPONY CAME
<GGgala> (aha! I was thinking of the Half-Life mod /They Hunger/)
<ValtheJean> I was very pleased with SC2
<ValtheJean> they really improved on their storytelling with it
<VioletVanilla> They Hunger has a few servers still up, it's a decent mod! GGgala
<Dashite> Eh...
<Dashite> Story in SC2 was...
*Glacymr puts SilverSonic someplace quiet so he can play LoZ
<VioletVanilla> And the music made me cream rainbows~
<ValtheJean> notice I said "improved" not "amazing" :P
<SilverSonic> :P
<SilverSonic> actually im making a YT video for an MSR remix i made
<GGgala> i'm gonna start playing sc2 next week, so i'm still in spoilers lockdown
<Glacymr> 12silly radio hosts
<Dashite> It was too game-y. They were more focused on creating missions to teach you how to use all the units.
<VioletVanilla> TUTORIAL TOWER
<SilverSonic> yeah, even tho this is a SEGA song, im playing it as a preshow track tomorrow
<VioletVanilla> 15 missions of Tutorials
<ValtheJean> again, it was improved
<SilverSonic> because usually for preshow songs, i play any game song i want ;p
<Glacymr> 12do a remix of an ozzy song
<ValtheJean> the Starcraft I story telling was awful
<Glacymr> 12mix it wwith some nintendo song
<ValtheJean> with the same like...2 missions over and over again
<Shadow> AAAAH! THAT FREAKY SHADOW LUGIA JUST APPEARED ON MY SCREEN!
<SilverSonic> LOL
<SilverSonic> Ozzy + Ninty = o-o
<ValtheJean> sure, it was excusable with WC2, because that was cutting edge at the time
<Shadow> oh, I was just Dakota...
<Dashite> What? You mean kill everything?
<Aurora> 6Hey bree guess what?
<Dashite> That's not a story issue, that's a mission design issue.
<Glacymr> 12?
<Aurora> 6I BROKE YOUR STUPID CRAP.
*Aurora 6BOINK
<GGgala> you mean survive/kill all enemy buildings?
<Dermathil> BREAST FIRE
<Glacymr> 12????
<drfsupercenter> 03Oh
<drfsupercenter> 03my
<drfsupercenter> 03god
<drfsupercenter> 03I am so scarred for life
<ValtheJean> your complaint was that the missions were too focused on teaching new units...
<Aurora> 6o.o?
<drfsupercenter> 03there was this weird bug flying around
<GGgala> but there's also: escort, make it through this maze
<drfsupercenter> 03looked like a fly mixed with an earwig
<drfsupercenter> 03grossest thing I've ever seen
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<SilverSonic> x.x Bad Images
<drfsupercenter> 03it would fly around a bit then vanish
<Glacymr> 12can't earwigs fly?
<drfsupercenter> 03so I couldn't use my bugzapper to kill it
<GGgala> reach this flag and then defend it
<drfsupercenter> 03after a while
<Dashite> Yeah, every mission in SC2 boiled down to spam the new unit till you win.
<drfsupercenter> 03it starts flying and landing on my arms, legs, all over my body
<Shadow> Dude, I had to log back in because of that freaky Shadow Lugia. IT JUST APPEARED ON MY COMPUTER SCREEN! Oh, wb, Aurora.
<drfsupercenter> 03I am so freaked out
<drfsupercenter> 03eventually I sucked it up with the vacuum but x__________-x
<Glacymr> 12lock your door drf
<SilverSonic> lol
*GGgala isn't sure what ValtheJean meant by same 2 missions over and over
<ValtheJean> you spammed goliaths on the terrazine mission?
<Glacymr> 12curl up in bed with the blanket toppled over you
<drfsupercenter> 03nop
<drfsupercenter> 03-p
<Glacymr> 12i think i might do the same because my confusion of Aurora has me so confused
<drfsupercenter> 03LL and I still need to Video Kinect later :P
<Dashite> I did make a fair number of them.
<Shadow> Dude, that Shadow Lugia is FREAKING ME OUT!
<Aurora> 6wat
<Glacymr> 12ewwwwwww wkinect
<Drake> 04AoM is working heckyes
<Dashite> Probably more than anything else.
<ValtheJean> well I prefer a long tutorial over fighting the same thing over and over again with the same strategy
<Glacymr> 12what do you mean broke my stuff
<ValtheJean> at least there's a feeling of progress and learning
<Dermathil> BREAST FIRE
<Glacymr> 12or were you just pulling my tail
<Shadow> *looks out window and screams* iiit's outside the window!!!:s
<Shadow> My cat really doesn't like that FREAKY SHADOW LUGIA!

<DeadlyPony> SOMEBODY THROW ME INTO A VOLCANO!
<MisterBristle> I've missed the last 6, 4 for my vacation, 2 for personal reasons

<GGgala> this story has holes in it like a half-eaten doughnut
<Polarfire> eeyup
<Sneas> 03So it's like this: Modem -> Router -> Computers
<VioletVanilla> This story has holes in it like Dashie in The Rerapening
<Polarfire> ...
<Dashite> Oh god, please don't bring that up again.
<Dakota> 2Ugh! Still can't get to sleep! Oh, I'm back guys.:(:)

<Sneas> 03For some reason my ethernet switch wouldn't work with the modem
<MisterBristle> WHERE
<MisterBristle> WHERE!?!?!?!?
<VioletVanilla> o:
<Sneas> 03It probably only allows one computer connection
<Polarfire> you say you missed the last 3.
<MisterBristle> I missed the last 6
<Polarfire> but apparently you missed the last 6?
<DeadlyPony> ....
<VioletVanilla> We're juss sayin' you seem a bit on the fritz about it all. . .
<DeadlyPony> Gahah
<GGgala> now i'm just confused
<MisterBristle> WHY AM I ON FUCKING TRIAL?
<Polarfire> well why isn't you name on the mod list?
<Sneas> 03So I just connected my wireless router and am using that as aw ethernet switch now
*VioletVanilla calms MisterBristle down with a cupcake
<Sneas> 03an*
<MisterBristle> ASK FUCKING HIPSTER, MR.JUDGE, HOLY SHIT

<Dashite> Ask someone who isn't here?
<GGgala> oh god so much src bzness
<GGgala> *srs
<MisterBristle> Well, WHEN HE GETS BACK
<Dashite> Honestly I don't really care. If it's true, it's true.
<VioletVanilla> @GGgala, I think we shall forever have The Rerapening as a hilarious reference. . .
<Dakota> 2I kept having a weird image of a light blue Lugia with a dark blu belly and ect. The weirdest part, it had front legs like som sort of dragon.
<MisterBristle> Look, I just hate being on trial
<GGgala> I've got a follow up dramatic reading but I'm waiting to suggest it till that one's finished
<VioletVanilla> @Dashite See that's the thing, if it's true then he wouldn't need to go all super defensive because he'd know we're jist trolling him
<Dakota> 2zzzzzz...
<VioletVanilla> @MisterBristle Hush now, Quiet now, it's going to be okay~ Lay down your little head, and dream the night away~
<Dashite> Yeah, but if he hasn't been around since the rest of us showed up he has no frame of reference for our behaviour to know if we are serious or not.
<MisterBristle> Violet, just ask Hipster, Silver, hell even Ghosties (he never liked me) when there around
<NewDCD> 9what's going on here?
<NewDCD> 9oh
<Polarfire> ohai
<MisterBristle> DCD THANK GOD!
<Dashite> lol
<GGgala> ahahaha
<NewDCD> 9I think I got a hang of the situation
<Dakota> 2did drfsuperenter leave?
<Dashite> INB4 mass kick!
<VioletVanilla> DCD
<NewDCD> 9you're wondering why you're not in the mod list, right?
<GGgala> now the hilarious misunderstandings have to come to an end, aw
<MisterBristle> Um, Yes?
<Polarfire> XD
<junh1024-XD> he's fixing a computer or something
<DeadlyPony> BLLLALALAALAL
<VioletVanilla> Awwww. . .
*GGgala has his breath bated
*GGgala or whatever
*VioletVanilla shoves a cupcake down DeadlyPony's throat
<MisterBristle> So, you gonna tell me......?
<Dashite> I think they switched IRC servers.
<MisterBristle> Was I fired for going on vacation XD
<VioletVanilla> You've been expelled from Hogwarts.
<NewDCD> 9well, I believe that since you were MIA without any news for so long, we thought you had stepped down from your mod duties. Additionally, we had to change the chat server so that explains why you can't log in with your name. Because it's not registered in this server, nor are your previous ops.
<MisterBristle> So, Hipster didnt tell ANYONE, I was on vacay?
<GGgala> see, I thought the server change was involved
<MisterBristle> NOBODY?
*Polarfire is struck with realization
<NewDCD> 9now, whether the other mods decide to bring you back to active server is beyond my hands. Or I don't know. I don't remember quite well.
<EpicStatsGuy> <Drake> I'm angry.
<NewDCD> 9Well, Bristle
<NewDCD> 9c'est un question
<NewDCD> 9what equipment do you run?
*Dashite hides the Realization behind his back before Polarfire discovers who hit him
<DeadlyPony> DDKLDLDDLLDDL
<MisterBristle> I even told all of you I was going....
<DeadlyPony> *Spits out cupcake*
<MisterBristle> What the hell man
<GGgala> LOL Dashite
<DeadlyPony> Sasparela!>
<NewDCD> 9well, I don't really have much of a say in this than a regular mod
*Glacymr doesn't fix junh1024-XD
<Glacymr> 12hi
<NewDCD> 9additionally due to personal issues, I have been a bit out of the loop from modding as well (albeit not from streaming, for the most part)
<VioletVanilla> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJvVHAh_INM
<junh1024-XD> ih

<Shadow> Huh? What? How did I...?
<Glacymr> 12why did you open up another window?
<Shadow> I didn't. \
<MisterBristle> You know, I think I might just stay off the team, I was always kinda the loser of the group XD
<Glacymr> 12whatever, close it
<junh1024-XD> your internet probably disconnect temporarily
<Glacymr> 12doesn't matter, just close it
<Aurora> 6it's mibbit
<Aurora> 6you can't get a second window without manually opening it
<VioletVanilla> DOES THAT MEAN YOUR POSITION IS OPEN? <:
<Dashite> No.
<MisterBristle> Shut up.
<MisterBristle> XD
<Dashite> There was no position open.
<Polarfire> Sorry, bristle. I didn't mean to grill you.
<GGgala> i think it was open weeks ago and got filled
<Dashite> There never was an open position.
<Shadow> yeah, I think the internet disconnected for a moment.
<NewDCD> 9eh, well, I wouldn't step down if I were you
<Dashite> We have always had a full mod team.
<MisterBristle> Why not DCD>
<MisterBristle> ?
<Dashite> We have always been at war with Eurasia.
<MisterBristle> Shut up 1984
<NewDCD> 9We just opened applications again and we're making an important announcement tomorrow.
<MisterBristle> XD
<Shadow> I hate when that happens!
<VioletVanilla> Yay~
<GGgala> Mod drama over?
<VioletVanilla> No. . . .
<Dashite> IMPORTANT ANNOUCEMENT: Lottery selection is now moderator only.
<MisterBristle> may I get a preview of the annoucment, maybe in la mod room, (Which I swear if you changed again XD)
<VioletVanilla> The drama has just begun. . .

<NewDCD> 9and
<VioletVanilla> @GGgala: Oh Everypony is coming. . . c;
<Dashite> We bought out the other brony movie night.
<VioletVanilla> @GGgala AT THE SAME TIME TEEHEE
<NewDCD> 9"we have to start looking for people who can stream the pony episodes live as they air in the Hub" expansion
<NewDCD> 9...and because of that
<MisterBristle> Well fuck me.

<NewDCD> 9yeah, somewhat like that
<Glacymr> 12Aurora what did you do with kyu
<NewDCD> 9while I appreciate everything Basil's done, bless his soul
<VioletVanilla> So, you need a TV tuner card
<Aurora> 6I sent him to a box
<MisterBristle> So a ton of work, that I have no idea how to help in anyway with?
<Aurora> 6in the middle of the pacific
<Aurora> 6no, he's actually camping
<Aurora> 6..
<Dakota> It did it again!
<NewDCD> 9the quality of his stream was, sadly, not up to my exigent, OCD-like standards for stream quality
<Glacymr> 12he'll make a wonderful treasure in the next windwaker game
<Aurora> 6you need to close the tab
<GGgala> too true, DCD
<Dakota> wut?
<Aurora> 6mibbit doesn't connect twice unless you have both tabs, and you do it by hand
<Glacymr> 12see that big red x
<Aurora> 6in short: it doesnt do it by accident
<Dakota> yep
<MisterBristle> I mean really, I have NO IDEA how you guys set this shit up, half the time I feel like a liability
<NewDCD> 9not to mention the fact that a chat in which you could post only a minute is...well, boring
<GGgala> we need to see the gyrobowls commercial in glorious HD
<VioletVanilla> IS THAT A BALLO-- LOOK AT THAT KITT-- MMM THIS SURE IS DELICIOUS DRIN-- HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT DASH'S BIG FAT SLOPPY WE-- I WONDER WHAT THE WEATHER IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE
<GGgala> we were using an IRC chatroom by the end, though!
<GGgala> it was called #LiveBrony , or #BronyLive ?
<Dakota> Random comment: my computer got stabbed by a butterknife.
<GGgala> on some network i can't remember
<NewDCD> 9because of that, we're planning on capacitating new mods that will serve as streamers (remember I don't live in US) and teaching them how to stream at the highest quality possible, as well as creating a chat room system which will set a max number of people per chat "theater"....
<Dakota> BRB
<NewDCD> 9well, Bristle
<NewDCD> 9here's the thing
<NewDCD> 9that thing I'm describing up there?
<VioletVanilla> Teach them. . .
<VioletVanilla> How to stream .. .
<NewDCD> 9We're gonna need some serious personnel
<VioletVanilla> .-. FML
<Glacymr> 12irrelevant information
<NewDCD> 9don't misunderstand me
<VioletVanilla> -headdesk-
<NewDCD> 9we want about three live-streamers in active duty
<GGgala> ooh we're splitting up into manageable theaters so we aren't flooded?
<Dakota> Me back...Once again...
<NewDCD> 9but we're also gonna need several other mods
<Dashite> INTERNET Y U SUCK SO MUCH?!
<Polarfire> That's an excellent idea
<NewDCD> 9indeed.
<Aurora> 6then close shadow
<Polarfire> splitting I mean
<Dakota> ok
<NewDCD> 9also this shit is secret, don't tell anybody just yet.
<Polarfire> okedoke
<Dashite> So no more 200 people trying to talk all at once.
<VioletVanilla> Okie Dokie Lokie!
<Dakota> wait for it....
*GGgala Pinkie Pie Swears
<NewDCD> 9we're aiming for rooms based in the mane 6 at first
<NewDCD> 9actually, Dashite
<Polarfire> DCD, did you spill the beans? :3
<NewDCD> 9it would be like 300 people per room
<Aurora> 6I would kill it but I can't
<Polarfire> :O
<NewDCD> 9yeah, but it doesn't really hurt to tell you about our future plans right now
<MisterBristle> Honestly bro, I just don't think I'm cut out for the job, I mean look at me regular modding! I kinda sucked.....
<VioletVanilla> DCD
<Glacymr> 12it's just going to come back apparently if i kill it
<Glacymr> 12i want to see if Dakota can figure out how to remove it lol
<Aurora> 6that doesnt make sense though
<NewDCD> 9have you seen how much traffic Basil's _low quality_ stream had?
<NewDCD> 9around 2000 viewers
<Aurora> 6dakota are you using the chat on the site?
<Glacymr> 12i can't stay up forever x-x
<Polarfire> ohai Sathi

<RDash> Hey Sathi!
<VioletVanilla> Night DeadlyPony
<Dashite> Kinda tired!
<Sathi> Hello Misterbristle
<NewDCD> 9it's not "we're trying to make this more manageable to read", it's more like "we're trying to keep it about the same level as movie nights, cause honestly, if the projected number of viewers come...that is going to be chaotic"
<NightSeas> 12Umbreon :)
<DeadlyPony> Or Mornin
<Dakota> Yeah! Shadow's finally gone!
<DeadlyPony> Whatever
<Glacymr> 12oh dear hi NightSeas

<MisterBristle> Yeah, I ;eft right around the time we started that
<Dashite> When RainBroDash isn't busy being kicked by Prince-Dari
<NewDCD> 9so yeah...of course, we'd have to test viewership first
<NightSeas> 12Thanks Dakota
<Sneas> 03Someone try connecting to irc.ambernova.net
<Sneas> 03please
<NightSeas> 12And you Umbreon?
<NewDCD> 9but possibly streaming the episodes live could make it for...quite the influx of viewers, actually
<Glacymr> 12oh
<Dakota> ouch! Now my foster great dane is sitting on me! (GET OFF, SPENCER! (Spencer is the dog's name))
<Glacymr> 12bleh
<Glacymr> 12trying to fall aslepe
<NewDCD> 9we're actually working on a "increasing limit" system as well, and will make new rooms if necessary eventually
<Glacymr> 12Why does lemonade contain artificial flavor while cleaning products contain real lemon?
<Link> i will
<Link> one sec
<Dakota> LOL
<MisterBristle> Look, my real question DCD is, do I need to show up tommorrow? From the looks of it I don't seem to be on the team any longer, which I suppose doest bother me to horribly haha
<NightSeas> 12XD
<SilverSonic> on AmberNova nao
<Sneas> 03Awesome, it works
<NewDCD> 9additionally a system that will redirect you to another room should the selected one be full...

<VioletVanilla> @MisterBristle I just wanted to apologize for earlier and all, that wasn't very nice of me to frustrate you, especially after your own personal troubles and the such. . . v.v
<SilverSonic> D:
<SilverSonic> nini
<NewDCD> 9it would be highly illogical to not talk this through
<Glacymr> 12Why do banks charge a fee on insufficient funds when they know there is not enough?
<GGgala> wait, when did applications open again? was it a thread on ponychan?
<Dakota> Ouch! Stupid dog...Spencer sat on me again.
<Polarfire> yeah, me too bristle. sorry man.
<Sathi> 7take a look at fb / twitter :)
<Glacymr> 12Why does someone believe you when you say there are four billion stars, but check when you say the paint is wet?
<NewDCD> 9ah, yes, you didn't hear about that, did you?
<MisterBristle> @VioletVanilla No problem Brony, I over reacted, I'm a bit stressted XD

<Dashite> I'd say it sounds good though. :)
<Aurora> 6?
<Glacymr> 12even before that
<Glacymr> 12Whose idea was it to put an S in the word lisp?
<NightSeas> 12They only have a picture of the Pokemon on one side, and the other side just talks about the Pokemon in the anime
<Sathi> 7I'll just copy paste for him

<Dashite> Yeah, that's pretty bad.
<Dashite> We had no rain for the month of July.

<Polarfire> Worst drought in 80 years they are saying

<Dashite> Wow
<Polarfire> and there's STILL not enough electicity to keep up with people's AC demands.
<Glacymr> 12i call dibs on the fact that he'll grow up to work for apple
<Polarfire> Its ridiculous. Next option is rolling blackouts, there's nothing left : /
<Glacymr> 12just so he can internally rip them apart
<Dashite> We set some records earlier this summer for heat, but electricity consumption didn't really spike too much above normal.
<Polarfire> Ours has spiked unbelievably. Its off the charts.
<Polarfire> Simply because it never cools off, not even after dark.
<junh1024-XD> glhf with that
<Polarfire> So people's home AC units run 24/7
<Dakota> again!? seriously!?:(

*Glacymr revokes SilverSonic's ownership on the fact he doesn't have enough badges
<Polarfire> well, we did the weather... I've run out of things to talk about XD
<Dakota> I feel like I'm on a roller coaster. Woohoo!...I'm going insane, aren't I?

<drfsupercenter> 031. A robot may not harm a human
<Caaz> I just came to a horrible thought, my favorite pianist might be a guy.

<Caaz> NO ONE KNOWS, SHE DOESN'T SHOW HER FACE ;O;
<drfsupercenter> 033. A robot may protect itself unless it contradicts the first two laws

<Barry> Who's the garden worker in Canterlot, then?
<GGgala> oh the guy with the golf clubs?
<Dman> 'Loans one of his fans to the Cutie Mark Crusaders. Wears a green Tam o' Shanter and vest. Despite his name, he does not look like the G3 Breezies.'
<GGgala> oh. fans
<Dman> There ya go
<Dman> "Cutie mark: four-bladed fan"
<Dman> Got a question? Always ask me i'm happy to help :3
<Pegacorn> Any Gs before G4 suck.
<Dman> ^
<GGgala> so he was just in the talent show episode?
<Dman> Yea
<Dman> But Mr Breezy is an official name, not fandom
<Dman> so I told Prince-Dari to put it in, and he kindly did so ;)
<Dubtrotmaster> derpy isnt her name it's ditzy doo
<GGgala> that's not quite official yet last i checked

<Dakota> Hellllllloooooo?
<Dman> GGgala = "Official names are listed over a light blue background. The names are mentioned in the show, Hasbro's toy line, or stated by the show's crew."

<GGgala> wait, is there somewhere people are getting the number one from specifically?
<Dman> dunnolol
<Dman> He hatched from his egg infront of Twi as a filly - he's surely over 1
<Dman> Spike has seen at least some winter to spring transitions as he tells Twi to use magic in WWU
<Dman> right?
<RDash> @pony The pony that comforts RDash after all of the unsuccessful waifus and could possibly lead to a relationship if RDash likes her
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony that comforts RDash after all of the unsuccessful waifus and could possibly lead to a relationship if RDash likes her is 7Applej8ack
<RDash> YES
<GGgala> ah, so we're just making shit up as we go along then. business as usual
<Barry> I think it's because it doesn't take long for a horse to become mature, only 4 years, and we've only seen one Summer Sun Celebration before this one
<Barry> Which leads fans to believe only one year has passed between the two
<Dman> yea but maybe more happened between the two celebrations?
<Barry> Possibly
<Dman> Nah i think it's got to be more than just one year
<Lighty> 06BBL, Groceries >>
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Okay. ovo
*Shadow_Lugia 6pokes Feather|Away.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6How long has she been away?
<eXAKR> Does anyone know where I can buy a real Millenium Ring from Yu-Gi-Oh?
<GGgala> people are seriously assuming that was the last year's SSC?
<GGgala> weird
<eXAKR> I want a real Gaydar
*eXAKR hides
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Lulz.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Make one.
<Barry> Also, however old Spike is, he's still a baby
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Or buy one off of cosplayers. :P
<eXAKR> </watching too much YuGiOh Abridged>
<Barry> which, if he's more than a year old, means that dragons mature very slowly
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I'd appreciate it more if it updated more often. :P
<Dman> pretty much
<Barry> btw, nice one RDash
<Barry> finally got some luck
<Dman> at last ;)
<Shadow> What up?
<RDash> Thanks, any female, older pony is fine haha
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Currently? On a YouTubeWalk.
<Dman> lol
<Dman> but y u no liek gilda?
<Shadow> :)
<Barry> because she's not a pony, she's a griffon
<GGgala> pony-racism
<Barry> exactly
<RDash> lol, you can have Gilda, Dman
<Barry> look at how Zecora was treated
<Barry> all for being a zebra
<Dman> i no : /
<RDash> She took the breakup hard, so now's a good time to ask
<Shadow> 2For me, I'm eating something that is supposed to be tomato soup but looks a lot like ketchup.
<RDash> barry Yea
<Barry> What was Twilight's friendship report on that episode again?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6o.o
<Light_Latias> 12o-o
<Dman> gilda one?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6If it's from a can, you have to adjust the density of the substance. :P
<Barry> Zecora
<Dman> Today I learned that it's hard to accept when somepony you like wants to spend time with somepony who's not so nice. Though it's impossible to control who your friends hang out with, it is possible to control your own behavior. Just continue to be a good friend. In the end, the difference between a false friend and one who is true will surely come to light.
<Dman> ah zecora one brb
<Dman> My friends and I all learned an important lesson this week: Never judge a book by its cover. Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary. But you have to look past that and learn who they are inside. Real friends don't care what your "cover" is; It's the "contents" of a pony that count. And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever
<Shadow> 2Burp...Oops, already gone.
<Dman> OH SNAP 10 seconds flat!
<Dman> :P
<RDash> lol
<Barry> ah
<GGgala> haha
<Dman> actually, more like 4 seconds :P
<RDash> Did you have Gilda's ready? 0.0
<Dman> Always happy to help ANYpony, everypony!

<Dman> KEKSI KEKSI KEKSI !!!!! ~~~
<RainBroDash> 10KEKSY KEKSY KEKSY
<Ziltoid> hey rainbrodash
<RainBroDash> 10up to much apart from worrying about the interview dermathil? ;)
<Dman> hey rainbrodash will all mods be there for demrathil's interview?
<Dakota> Never mind. I'm back.
<Dman> cuz if you prince and sathi are you can all say nice things right
<Dman> so dermathil can be mod
<Dermathil> yeah, playing SRW-J that DCD sent me a link to. Fandubbed in english and patched by DCD (he said yours truly)
<Dakota> Trying to write a story when you're dead tired is a bore.
<RainBroDash> 10interviewing mods isn't about saying nice things, it's about assessing potential I'm afraid
<Dman> potenshul for what?
<RainBroDash> 10for modding?
<Dermathil> no problem
<IcyNinetales> 2Playing Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future and tackling the level Hanging Waters is even more frustrating when you've just woken up in the morning.
<Dakota> uh....wut?
<EccoCode> The second part of Hanging Waters (After Fire and Ice) was the hardest of the three to me.
<Dman> I'm going now, but i'll be back for BMN! bai bai
<Dermathil> cya Dman
<Dman> cya Dermathil
<IcyNinetales> 2@EccoCode: Yeah, I saw a LP of DotF and I saw how tough it was.
<iCi> Hello all
<IcyNinetales> 2Still, I don't plan on quitting this game so easily. It's my current goal to try and complete DotF before I play anything else.
<iCi> Where is admin?
<IcyNinetales> 2ACK! I g2g. I need food. XD;;;;

<RainBroDash> 10way too SOON
<Pinkamina> Hey, what do you think of forums where mods are allowed to break their own rules?
<RainBroDash> 10It depends on circumstance I think, what's the context?
<Ziltoid> you mean they can post porn?
<Pinkamina> No, they can flame other members
<RainBroDash> 10but they don't allow people to flame back, essentially?
<Pinkamina> Right.
<RainBroDash> 10Well that just sounds a bit power trippy to me, but I'd rather know more before I was too harsh :P
<Pinkamina> Sonic Stadium is like that.
<Pinkamina> Fuck that forum, seriously.

*Light_Latias 12there nao
<VioletVanilla> I AM TRYING TO GET THE WICKER MAN
<RainBroDash> 10Dumori the official divide is done by budget. But here we tend to make the decision on 'A' or 'B' as being down to seriousness :P

<Dermathil> *shivers*
<MisterBristle> Can we just have Season 2 already? Seriously
<Silverscreen> 11That's a pretty big risk seeing how the last series went down in flames.
<Silverscreen> 11and the overall reaction to the new movie is luke-warm at best.
<Dakota> hi, NightSeas.
<NightSeas> 12Hello Dakota :3
<hankhill> This isn't super fun. I want my money back!
<Dermathil> because of the 1st person sequence at the end.
<Silverscreen> 11exactly.
<Dakota> So, what up?
<Ziltoid> lol
<Dermathil> First, that scene was way too much CGI.
<Silverscreen> 11I like how they're keeping with the dark, realistic tone that's been set recently.
<Dermathil> They need to make it look more realistic.
<Tyranico> hankhill = MG?

<Silverscreen> 11too bad we can't have grills on campus here. :\
<Dermathil> yeah. The dark tone is good, but the CGI (because it was 100% cgi and nothing else) was way too much everywhere.
<Silverscreen> 11It's a nice day for a cook out.
<Hawkie> 07Meep!
<hankhill> I don't got grills but I still wear braces.
<Hawkie> 07Just, I miss someone is all.

*Dakota falls back cause chair breaks.
<Silverscreen> 11I'm disapointed that they're going with CGI to remove the professor's arm instead of practical effects.

<durger> Fritz, it was funny at first now it's annoying BWOOOONG
<MrPoniator> Inception is compared to Shutter Island?
<kenneyc> point taken sklar
<Xiagu> it's a cool flick, but it's not a deep psychological thing
<InsertKeksy> Yeah while i was waiting for the stream to start I just had ponyspin on for a good while
<RainBroDash> 10Ghosties has the right idea. Ellen Page all over this shit.
<interior_gummy> if it has scarlett i'm sold
<FritzTheCat> I hate Inception more and more each time I watch it.
<Xiagu> Inception is a very well put together action movie.
<Shadowlost> Never saw Shutter
<Elky> inception os slightly overrated
<SilverMane> Quick reticentsmolder, more shipping to entertain the ponies!
<Combustiblelemons> All I know is it's hard to understand.
<Xiagu> and that's about it
<Hipster_Brony> 8our streamer is parking right now, he will be here momentarily
<Toty> All I know about Inception is BWONG
<Shadowlost> Xiagu has it
<ReticentSmolder> RainBroDash would probably explode twice if Rainbow Dash and Ellen Page happened to be the same person canonically
<Tacowiz> If I win the B-movie lottery tomorrow, do I choose Planet of the Apes or Rocky Horror?
<Elky> so yeah, what xiagu said
<Shadowlost> It's a very well put together action movie
<InsertKeksy> Theres not many inception memes that are very goo-BWOOOOOOONG
<Tacowiz> On one hand, Planet of the Apes is a classic.
<sklar> MMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm quite kennyc
<interior_gummy> inception may or may not be a dream
<WF_Chronicles> 0BWOOOONG
<Tacowiz> On the other hand, Rocky Horror is a MUSICAL.
<EspyLacopa> I thought the lottery was tonight?
<Combustiblelemons> Planet of the apes I say
<SilverMane> Tacowiz, ROCKY
<RainbowLoon> double rainbow? http://poorlydressed.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/fashion-fail-rave-rainbow-vomit.jpg
<interior_gummy> captain america is decent, i saw it
<Elky> we definitely need a rocky horror screening
<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder... I think I would explode thricew
<HuffytheMagicDragon> http://mibpaste.com/M0fiAZ

<Calvin> :P
<MrPoniator> Screw Planet of the Apes. Someone needs to make Planet of the Ponies as I suggested
<DSNesmith> ya'll need to pick wicker man
*SilverMane does the time warp again
<Xiagu> I like how Inception manages to maintain Magic A is Magic A all the way through (mostly)
<EspyLacopa> I'm going to go with "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Fantastic Adventures of Unico"
<Dman> thricew
<Dman> :D
<GamerGodJones> anypony want the inception button? http://inception.davepedu.com/
<Calvin> How come it doesn't work?
<DSNesmith> Hey, Silvermane, that's stuck in my head now. So thanks for that.
<Elky> then again, I assume there'll be a special rocky horror showing sometime
<Calvin> it says that the broadcast is offline

<desertman2> I think by now most of us are apathetic towards the game
*ReticentSmolder The tough part, she quickly realized, was fitting all of the moving pieces within the chassis of the pony in a way that didn’t obstruct other parts. Trial and error had gotten her close, but her frustration with the toy was quickly reaching its boiling point.

<sotha> Railguns are the best Elky. So it's only fair Rarity should use a magical sniper Railgun.
<ReticentSmolder> so if ponies have tanks, is it assumed that at some point there was use for them? Because that would imply Equestria has gone to war.
