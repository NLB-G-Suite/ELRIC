<emangamer> Saturn: you need to read Sunset
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer: i have
<Mutterguy> I'm guessing Mtg tactics partly runs on 4ed D&D rules '. New gameplay such as flanking, obstacles, movement, and line of sight add a truly tactical element'
<K_A> Randomnerd: I consider bronies to be the Western analogue to Japan's Touhou Project doujin circles and fans.
<Saturn> 08,01i've read... a lot of fic
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Eternal anyone ?
<Terok> i would like to have that link too :)

<Randomnerd> K_A That's a fair assessment
<emangamer> Saturn: wait chich one did you read? cuz there are 2 of them

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Valve time

<DeadpoolDash> what game is this?
<emangamer> oh, well go read Sunset...it's amazing
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> might and magic i think
<emangamer> ^
<Kencolt> Just watched the nwe ep.. was tired before. Loved it. Finally, an episode that understands us older people.
<Mutterguy> Might and magic something something because the franchise is at least 15 years old
<emangamer> Kencolt: no spoilers
<skyguardian18> G'morning
<Kencolt> None given. It's a mere matter of age.
<Dashie_Dashie|TF2> ^
<emangamer> Kencolt: I know, I'm just warning you
<Kencolt> I give no details-- I can simply relate.

<emangamer> Wrek: I need you to teach me how to use illustrator
<Randomnerd> Hm.
<K_A> Wrek: How's using a Mac? I like them for productivity.
<K_A> emangamer: There are tons of docs, tutorials, and videos for Adobe products.
<Wrek> 05mfw mac
<mario_pony> this one time at band camp.......
<K_A> Wrek: Looks like a Mac to me.
<K_A> Well, OSX.
<K_A> Wait, you were playing a game earlier.
<Kencolt> What i see is a lot of gray.
<K_A> It can't be Mac! XD
<K_A> Okay
<Jim> >Windows taskbar
<emangamer> K_A: but i'm too lazy to watch them
<Wrek> 05oops FMLA crashed
*Rain is estatic
<Kencolt> and now the spinny thing.
<emangamer> Rain: whats up?
<K_A> Sorry Wrek. :\
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into the chat. HAI!
<Rain> I get to watch Wrek draw, thats what emangamer :3

<K_A> It works after reloading.
<Zappy> There we go.
<ekips> stream is running for me
<StickySyrup> got stream
*Rain is happy that she can finally watch Wrek draw again
<Midnight_Tempest> Randomnerd: Eldar are easy to kill, as long as you have the right units... >_< then there's Dark Eldar... do not want...
<Randomnerd> Dark Eldar are freaking nuts.
<ekips> is there a better thing to do than playing minecraft and watching wrek drawing at 2am?
<Rain> nope
<Zappy> Interesting tunes we have here.
<Midnight_Tempest> i prefer playing against Ork players, they tend to have more fun than most other people
<DeadpoolDash> draw time?
<StickySyrup> im so tired. Spent all day writing my fanfic. Its now on 14,000 words =)
<Randomnerd> I botched my shooting. I kept going after his stupid rangers, when I should have just blasted his Scorps into powder.
<Rain> nothing is better than watching Wrek draw
<Phase4> Zappy: yeah
<Randomnerd> Orks are hilarious :D
<Phase4> hello all the people, ding me if you need me
<StickySyrup> Phase4: i need you
<Randomnerd> Hiya Phase4
<ekips> oh Midnight_Fire you're playing dawn of warII too?
<Phase4> i change tab, insta dings :D
<Midnight_Tempest> >_< ouch Randomnerd... you should never focus on one unit like that... what army you play btw?
<Rain> Phase4 I dont need you but I might want you :3
<StickySyrup> Wrek: do u use a mouse?
<Randomnerd> Midnight_Tempest: I'm IG.
<Rain> he used to
<K_A> This doesn't look worksafe.
<StickySyrup> looks like a cock
<Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPfMb50dsOk&list=PLBFAD0DEDD032CDBD&feature=mh_lolz some tunes if interested
<unfoundbug> what did i just load into the stream to see
<Rain> lololoolololollolol
<unfoundbug> ...
<Randomnerd> It was a 1000 pt skirmish. I had Infantry and Tanks.
<Midnight_Tempest> o.o how did you botch up... THAT much shooting, Randomnerd
<Jim> Why do I keep hearing the pony version of this song in my head?
<Randomnerd> His rangers were in cover.
<mario_pony> is it pinkie pie??
<StickySyrup> ewwww
<Randomnerd> Pathfinders fucking suck like that...
<ekips> are you two talking about warhammer40k dawn of war2?
<StickySyrup> Jim: me 2
<K_A> Octavia?
<CriticKitten> Ooooh, Wrek drawing. :3
<mario_pony> o
<Randomnerd> I took out his swooping hawks, and his Viper Jetbikes.
<K_A> No, I think it's Pinkie.
<Midnight_Tempest> ekips: warhammer 40K yes, not dawn of war 2 though
<Kencolt> looks like a dancing pose.
<Randomnerd> ekips: nnnope, the tabletop game.
<RawketLawnchair> Pathfinders?
<RawketLawnchair> [VGS]
<EspyLacopa> oo, new Transformers Prime
<Randomnerd> Yeah, the upgrade for the Eldar Rangers.
<Midnight_Tempest> Randomnerd: against Eldar you should have something that ignores cover... like flamer chimeras
<Randomnerd> I didn't have enough of it :-/
<Midnight_Tempest> ouch
*Rain watches with intrest :3
<OneTrickPony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFo0_fOMS8s&feature=youtu.be new vid i uploaded
<Randomnerd> Midnight_Tempest: I had a heavy flamer on one tank, that was about it.
<Randomnerd> I'm building my tanks with magnets so I can swap their loadout.
<Midnight_Tempest> good idea
<Jim> OneTrickPony: Excellent ^^ But I think you should be warning about mild spoilers
<OneTrickPony> oh okay
<mario_pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xaOfbHRMA
<Randomnerd> Midnight_Tempest: what do you play?
<mario_pony> love that song!:)
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Midnight_Tempest> Randomnerd: I play a SM army, very dreadnaught heavy... got 5 dreads usually in my army if i can
<RaveBrony> Drawing still going on??
<Randomnerd> Nice.
*Rain prepairs her body for the rave that is about to insue
<RaveBrony> Wtf?? Saturday night and chat is near dead??
<Midnight_Tempest> Randomnerd: i even have a model from Forge World, one of the newer land raiders... the Achielles
<Mutterguy> I'm mildly interested because lots of my friends play
<Midnight_Fire> One more, because I was bored http://derpy.me/V87Ak
<Randomnerd> I never played MEQ, Midnight_Tempest -I've always wanted to play Dark Angels, but that's bc I was an Alter Boy, lol.
<Mutterguy> nooo we're watching drawing
<Jim> I swear, that picture is everywhere ^^
<StickySyrup> ok everypony.. im going to sleep. If u wana check out my fanfic that I just updated.. link is here. You dont have to, but its a good read for anyone who likes adventure/action
<StickySyrup> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/8662/The-Power-of-Stars
*Rain raves
<Randomnerd> Bye, StickySyrup
<RaveBrony> Omg!! Drawing is still going on!! I came back at a good time! :o
<StickySyrup> nighnight
<Midnight_Tempest> Dark Angels are a cool army, im basing mine on a chapter known as the Minotaurs
<Zappy> Night StickySyrup.
<Kencolt> Drawing just started.
<Rain> sleep well
<RaveBrony> Is this Wrek drawing? O.o
<Rain> yes
<Jim> Good night stick- oh he left
<Mutterguy> uhuh
<Rain> wrek is the only one that draws
<RaveBrony> Awesomeeeee!!
<Randomnerd> Nice. My IG are Mordian Iron Guard, but I'm using the Crimson Fist's colors.
<RaveBrony> Just wanted to make sure :P
<Rain> well now you know ^_^
<RaveBrony> :)
<Midnight_Fire> I believe Fluttershy draws
<RaveBrony> Yeah, i thot someone else drew for us once :o
<Midnight_Tempest> Randomnerd: this is my fav tank right now, i still havent used it yet but its sick http://derpy.me/PPyKx
<Mutterguy> SuperBrony64 does draw but not on cam
<Rain> fluttershy doesnt stream here anymore sillys
<RaveBrony> But Wrek is the show off ;)
<mario_pony> stacy's mom has got it going on!
<Randomnerd> They just look fantastic. I'm debating a different pallete, though. Maybe make them look like the Fighting 69th, the Civil War regiment.
<Wrek> 05haha
<Randomnerd> HOLY CROW, That's sexy.
<Wrek> 05i draw cause peopel want it douche ;3
<Rain> ^
<Midnight_Tempest> Randomnerd: IKR?
<Midnight_Fire> That pony is air guitaring
*Rain bounces
*Rain bobs her head
<Kencolt> Heh.. I'm the only pony Wrek can't draw.. because I'm a wolf. Not a pony. Just a wolf that gets along with ponies.
<Randomnerd> SPEHS MEH-RINES.
*Rain raves
<Rain> then you are not the only pony Wrek cant draw silly
<Rain> you are a wolf
<Midnight_Fire> Wrek can't draw me because he hasn't seen my OC
<Rain> Wrek can draw anypony
<Midnight_Tempest> oh and Randomnerd: that tank is ridiculous to the extreme... front mounted thunderfire cannon, 2 twinlinked multi-meltas, immune to the lance rule and the extra die from a melta shot ^_^
<Kencolt> I just said that.
<Rain> "Heh.. I'm the only pony Wrek can't draw" you are contradicting yourself sir
<Randomnerd> Midnight_Tempest: FW has NO CONCEPT of balance.
<IshBestPony> I haz present foar you, Indian Stallone without the buffer icon http://imgur.com/AcilG
<Wrek> 05hmm
<Randomnerd> I'm the kind of pony every pony should know.
<RaveBrony> Wrek!! You should draw a WoW or Halo pony sometime :)
<CriticKitten> Ohai, kitty here
<Kencolt> Pony in spirit,,, somewhat. The rest of the pack doewn't get it.
<Midnight_Fire> But the buffer icon is what gives him personality
<KernelCobb> OOOH wrek is drawing again! You are my inspiration wrek!
<RaveBrony> ^
<IshBestPony> http://imgur.com/AcilG
<Midnight_Tempest> Randomnerd: true, but that isnt even the worst of FW's models... the tank is about 400 points all decked out... it can have a seige sheild, making it immune to getting immobilized on terrain :D
<Randomnerd> BAAAAAAAAANEBLAAAAAADE!
<Midnight_Tempest> also, i can only use that tank if my opponent lets me... otherwise i have to play it in apocalypse games
<Randomnerd> Chief Thunder Hooves has been a VA in DoW II
<Kencolt> And, no, not like those Timberwolves. We're actually kind of like ponies in build, but with paws and fangs and well... wolfish things. And usually taller. A bit. Not like those mindless Tree things...
<Randomnerd> I know... The FW stuff is pretty crazy.
<Midnight_Tempest> awesome... did anyone else notice that Grumpy in the new episode was Rhinox from Beast Wars? or was it just me?
<RaveBrony> Wrek, you got artist block or something? o.o
<Midnight_Tempest> Randomnerd: check out the Titans... that is where it gets CRAZY
<Mutterguy> that's the voice actor.... that make sense
<Kencolt> Whatever he's darwing, it's got a GUN.
<Randomnerd> Midnight_Tempest: Cranky was the same VA, I think.
<Midnight_Fire> a big gun
<Midnight_Tempest> cranky... thats his name... lol
<Randomnerd> Midnight_Tempest: Titans are awesome. I wish I could play those things :O
<Kencolt> I can emphsise with Cranky-- I've been there.
<Midnight_Fire> When your parents name you cranky it doesn't really give you man y options in life, does it?
<Randomnerd> Adeptus Titanicus is just fun to say!
<Randomnerd> Big O! Big O, Big O, Big O!!!
<Mutterguy> same for the 7 dwarfs
<Midnight_Tempest> Randomnerd: you can... if you have 700$ to buy them, and want to haul them around >_<
<Randomnerd> That's what I mean, Midnight_Tempest -_-
<Midnight_Tempest> Randomnerd: you know what is awesome... someone had so much time on their hands, they made a too scale Imperator Titan... its amazing
<mario_pony> why does wrek love ponies with guns soo much?
<KernelCobb> i need a drawing pad
<Mutterguy> Didn't some one make a 6ft scale model mech ?
<DeadpoolDash> pony with a big gun
<Wrek> 05i hate making guns on the fly
<Wrek> 05but thoughts thus far?
<Rain> it looks badass yo
<mario_pony> bye everypony!
<Midnight_Tempest> very nice... me like the dakka
<Rain> bye mario_pony
<PartyCannon> Au contraire, mon capitan! Heeee's back!
<Kencolt> It ain't what I want. But the gun is cool.
<Randomnerd> HOLY CROW I'm looking at it.
<PartyCannon> dat gun
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> looking good Wrek
<Randomnerd> Oh, hey, "Freundschaft"! Ist Magie?
<Midnight_Fire> looks great
<Randomnerd> Tvilight Shparkle!
<Midnight_Tempest> Randomnerd: http://derpy.me/8mK-n an Imperator Titan... at Games Day... :D
<Kencolt> Vast amounts of heated lead is magic, more like.
<K_A> Suddenly, I want to see Ghost in the Shell ponies.
<Midnight_Tempest> ^
<Midnight_Tempest> this is best idea
<Randomnerd> That's brilliant.
<Kencolt> Oh, GAWD.. Twilight inn HER outfit might make me explode. TWICE.
<KwakLad2> Hullo folk, is this another syndicate pony or another theme pony?
<Kencolt> And NO PONY ELSE could pull it off-- they have the same minds!
<Midnight_Tempest> oh Randomnerd... you know which character in 40K can kill a Titan?
<Derpy_Hooves> http://twentypercentcooler.net/forum/show/3797?page=4 there are only TEN spots left in the bronystate projects
<Randomnerd> Too many :(
<Wrek> 05hmm
<Derpy_Hooves> also wrek
*Wrek doesnt know how to continue
<Saturn> 08,01so i'm listening to a reading of Patty Cakes, and this is the only thing going through my mind: http://du.cx/26Q
<CriticKitten> Well, who is it supposed to be?
<Midnight_Tempest> Randomnerd: hmm... looking at the new codecs that have come out... your probably right >_<
<emangamer> huh...weird
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> whats this bronystate project ? and why is this the first time i heard of it ?
<emangamer> Saturn: patty cakes?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm restreaming Wrek right now for a damn channel verification.
<Midnight_Fire> I started reading Patty Cakes once. I didn't get far before closing the page
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer: you... really probably don't want to know
<Kencolt> Is there room for the token wolf?
<emangamer> Saturn: then yea I dont
<Wrek> 05GAH
<emangamer> Derpy_Hooves: thank you again for that...i cant wait to see it
<RaveBrony> ???
<Saturn> 08,01it's horribly out of character, porrly wirtten, and contains some... interestingly horrifying subject matter
<Midnight_Tempest> Wrek has artists block
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> don't read it trust me
<emangamer> Derpy_Hooves: would it be a little too much to ask to have me Otakon and Scootachicken put next together?
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: draw indian ponies
<Midnight_Tempest> Wrek: instead of a gun, make it a spear or a lance? just an idea
<Saturn> 08,01bollywood pinkie
<RaveBrony> Noooo!! Master chief pony!! (Halo)
<Midnight_Fire> Draw Bollywood ponies dancing
<Midnight_Tempest> boo halo...
<Wrek> 05AHA
<otakon> no
<emangamer> otakon: what?
<Kencolt> Saturn: what part of Twilight in a sai DOESN"T suggest that?
<otakon> NOT bollywood pinkie
<RaveBrony> boo halo? why?
<ekips> draw a minecraft pony :3
<Jim> More Indian Stallone http://imgur.com/IgUTQ

<KernelCobb> THE WORLD DIED
<bartsonic> seriously
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So I got some...not bad
<CrossChop114> CAN WE HAS PONIES PLEASE?
<Hodiku> tacos again SB?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yesh :3
<SuperBrony64> 10,02i liek tacos :3
<KernelCobb> CrossChop114: on the screen isn't a pony?
<Midnight_Fire> Put her in a sari, Wrek
<bartsonic> time to go to burger king
<Jim> But..Tacos at burge- Does not compute
<MahBoi777> it's always TTaco time
<pony_9608> taco bell is best taco place
<IronSights> SuperBrony64, im not calling you a liar, but thats a lie
<Jim> I'm not complaining though
<TOY_PON3> Back and so seriously did anypony get the new promo TF2 item?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:<
<SuperBrony64> 10,02y is it a lie? ;___;
<Jim> a new TF2 item?
<MahBoi777> Taco Burger
<TOY_PON3> Yes The Black Rose
<IronSights> because i was told to say so
<Saturn> 08,01okay, let's see... our sun is a G2V star, which means it's right in the middle of the main sequence of the hertzsprung russel diagram, a measure of a star's luminosity against its temperature
<MahBoi777> SB doesn't lie about tacos
<bartsonic> lol
<TOY_PON3> That's because SB is a taco...
<Saturn> 08,01the hotter a star is, the bluer it is, and the coler it is the redder
<KernelCobb> Saturn: i read that in my physics book last year
<IronSights> ahah
<KernelCobb> something new plz
<Saturn> 08,01these colours refer to the black body peak of a star's spectrum
<Saturn> 08,01hmm, okay
<Tarku> SuperBrony64 = tacos a|s Derpy = muffins :D
<Saturn> 08,01how about soemthing about the lhc?
<Midnight_Fire> And some stars are so cold you could walk on them
<CrossChop114> *knows this*
<KernelCobb> Saturn: i keed, really, i love you
<IronSights> :o
*Jim bobs head
<Saturn> 08,01the lhc is actually made of 4 seperate accelerators
<pony_9608> mooon facts
<Tarku> and ohai everypony
<Jim> ohai Tarku
<Saturn> 08,01or rather, accelrator segments
<Wrek> 05name the artist
<KernelCobb> Saturn: go on :)
<Wrek> 05its rather easy
<CrossChop114> WE NEED MOON AND PONIES
<IronSights> Saturn, spams science
<bartsonic> so i was about to buy a my little pony toy today
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ZZ RTOP
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*Top
<KernelCobb> CrossChop114: if we had ponies all the time, they would stop being special
<IronSights> alliteration is magic
<Midnight_Fire> You are the artist, Wrek :)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I just checked the stream
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and BAM
<MahBoi777> hey Tarku, LOL
*MahBoi777 now knows why the name is Saturn
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that awesome Blues rock
<SaxyPretender> 0,14La Grange
<TOY_PON3> Well just found out that the new Twisted Metal game wasn't as good as it was supposed to be..
<TOY_PON3> :/
<IronSights> i call a lie,
<IronSights> everypony is a lie.
<CrossChop114> Yeah.
<KernelCobb> everypony is cake
<Saturn> 08,01there's first a linear accelerator stage, which accelerates protons up to (i think 150GeV)
<Jim> But no TOY_PON3, where do you get that TF2 item?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01eats self.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Fun fact about ZZ Top: the drummer is the only one withour an epic beard. Ironically enough, his last name IS Beard.
<MahBoi777> Saturn is the best at space
<Sumica> 00,10wth wrek you start the arts and dont tell me ;_;
<Tarku> lolz SaxyPretender
<CrossChop114> Then can't we just have something that's not a still screen or Indian?
<KernelCobb> Saturn: lol i actually understand what you are saying, surprisingly, do go on ;)
<Saturn> 08,01then there's protons go into the first synchrotron stage: the proton synchrotron
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Wrek, dat Twilight is looking awesome :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saturn, are you taking Physics?
<Saturn> 08,01i think that acellerates up to 300GeV
<pony_9608> i wish i was a smarty pants like saturn
<MahBoi777> incredible artist
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Fun fact number 2: ZZ Top is the longest running band that still has its original members and has never changed their line up.
<TOY_PON3> Jim: You have to download Alliance of Valiant Arms, make a character, and play a round and then you will get the item. The Black Rose is brand new so yeah.
<TOY_PON3> Get it!
<Saturn> 08,01after that is the Super Proton Synchrotron, which accelrates the particles up to 450GeV (i know this for a fact)
<Midnight_Fire> Really? Interesting
<SaxyPretender> 0,14YES
<IronSights> the base of the niagra falls, has receded about 7 miles in the past ten thousand years, due to erosion
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Sharp Dressed Man!
<CrossChop114> AVA isn't that great.
<Wrek> 05suddenly my juices are flowing
<SaxyPretender> 0,14This is my jam!
<KernelCobb> Saturn: what happens to the particles at this stage?
<TOY_PON3> I uninstalled it :P
<MahBoi777> lolwut
<Hazard3> WHOA!
<KernelCobb> do they alter in any way?
<bartsonic> has anypony bought a my little pony toy
<IronSights> eww, Wrek
<Sumica> 00,10wrek......might want to rephrase that
<Hazard3> Do you have a multimeter?
<Hazard3> nevermind
<MahBoi777> LOL
<CrossChop114> It's a reskin of the stock knife
<TOY_PON3> bartsonic: I have the mane 6
<Wrek> 05creative juices, the hell were you thinking? PERV
<Tarku> well G`night everypony~
<Hazard3> It feels like im putting out an extra half a volt!
<TOY_PON3> CrossChop114: Indeed it is
<IronSights> :)
<Jim> Epic drumming
<Saturn> 08,01the main storage ring of the LHC actually uses the tunnels of its predecessor, the LEP (Large Electron Positron Collider)
<TOY_PON3> But it still looks awesome!
<Jim> good night Tarku
<Sumica> 00,10like you have to ask
<Midnight_Fire> Fun Fact: Longest running band with at least one original member is the Blind Boys of Alabama, started in 1939
<DeadpoolDash> juice sauce
<TOY_PON3> night Tarku
<Saturn> 08,01the main ring accelerates particles up to 7GeV
<KernelCobb> Saturn: what accelerates these particles? does this happen naturally are artificially?
<bartsonic> i was gonna buy one today then my mom looked at me said are you gay and made me put it back :(
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Fun Fact: Wrek is an awesome artist with epic taste in music.
<Saturn> 08,01this is centre of mass collision energy
<Saturn> 08,01KernelCobb: very much artificially
<TOY_PON3> Even though I didn't really like AVA man this knife was so word it.
<Hazard3> we need to develop space travel
<KernelCobb> Saturn: i assumed
<DeadpoolDash> sweet ZZ Top
*TOY_PON3 polishes his Black Rose
<awesomesauce> KernalCobb~ I did it!!! http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/epyu
<IronSights> i dont like his taste in music, but i respect his difference of opinion
<awesomesauce> eypu
<DeadpoolDash> had the sound turned off so some reason
<Midnight_Fire> Haven't bought a toy yet
<MahBoi777> ohai awesomesauce
<Saturn> 08,01KernelCobb: there are two kinds of force enacting on the particles: electrostatic and magnetic
<PinkySpice> i need more tolerence....
<CrossChop114> it eypu not epyu.
<SolarColt> Lmao really awesomesauce
<awesomesauce> ohau
<KernelCobb> awesomesauce: i love you awesomesauce!
<MahBoi777> hi PinkySpice
<Hazard3> Magnetism is the strongest?
<awesomesauce> so do i
<Saturn> 08,01KernelCobb: of these, there are dipole magnets, and quadropole magnets
<TOY_PON3> Midnight_Fire: You haven't bought a me yet?
<IronSights> its eyup
<CrossChop114> YOU MISSPELLED THE MISSPELL
<PinkySpice> ???
<IronSights> no all caps
<MahBoi777> ????
<KernelCobb> Saturn: quadropole? wow
<Midnight_Fire> I only just found a place near me that sells blind bags on Thursday
<Hazard3> god damn Saturn ur sounding like Gordan Freeman!
<CrossChop114> bWEEP.
<Saturn> 08,01iirc, the quadropoles keep the beam aligned verticallly and horizontally, and the dipoles, produce the circular acceleration
<SolarColt> im back, had to listen to this song a 65427th time http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1O0ErRhdoI
<rainbow_fire> numm.(:
<Midnight_Fire> My local Wal Mart doesn't carry pony stuff, but the one a couple towns over does
<MahBoi777> Hazard3: waitaminute....
<TOY_PON3> Midnight_Fire: For shame..I usually am all over the place. In various colors
<awesomesauce> le fix
<Hazard3> why dont we just invent a fucking superpower laser weapon?
<Hazard3> WHY>?!
<CrossChop114> HELL YES
<bartsonic> oh well ill buy one soooon
<KernelCobb> Saturn: so this is nearly an effortless acceleration?
<Hazard3> its more possible than going to mars and breathing!
<KernelCobb> Saturn: nearly done by itself?
<flutter_spin> whatup
<SolarColt> i already have one >:D
<Midnight_Fire> Unfortunately they only had a few blind bags left, and none of the mane 6
<TrixieMuffin> Id buy pony toys , sadly local stores only have the fake stuff
<TOY_PON3> I usually sell for $5.00 steal from your parents wallet
<TOY_PON3> :3
<Hazard3> XD
<SolarColt> TrixieMuffin:
<Midnight_Fire> I have to go to that area once a week for classes though, so I'll keep checking back
<TOY_PON3> Seriously buy me! I need moar love!
<Smoker> :3
<kidzrul434> Hi I'm steve
*KernelCobb throws money at TOY_PON3
<SolarColt> theres some good replicas coming from mcdonalds i've heard
<rainbow_fire> Heroow
<MahBoi777> Hiiiii Steeeeeve
<CrossChop114> Everyone dance and FUCKIN' SMILE
<Saturn> 08,01KernelCobb: quite the opposite, in fact; massive amounts of energy need to be put into the system. obviously, it's in a vacuum, so there's no friction, but energy is lost as synchrotron radiation
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Gimme All Your Lovin'
<TOY_PON3> Midnight_Fire: Buy me as soon as you have money.
<Saturn> 08,01because of the circular acceleration
<Smoker> good song.
<bartsonic> i shall do it need to be at store by myself so my mom doesnt give me confuesed look about my sexuality
<SolarColt> lol CrossChop114 are you listening to smile?
<KernelCobb> Saturn: OHH i see, that's the part i was missing.
<MahBoi777> I'm learning so much\
<TOY_PON3> I liek the song playlist :3
<Midnight_Fire> I'll buy you as soon as the store has mane 6 blind bags in stock
<Lyra> good song
<TOY_PON3> Midnight_Fire: Yay :3
<Hazard3> okay so the possibility of a laser beam in a compact form isnt far fetched....we just need to make one thats portable or atleast deadly enough to cause damage
<Smoker> wtf?
<Midnight_Fire> I will check once a week
<KernelCobb> Saturn: but let me get this straight, once they begin to accelerate, they continue to move eachother?
<bartsonic> why is celestia pink
<TOY_PON3> ^^
<Saturn> 08,01KernelCobb: how do you mean?
<TOY_PON3> Because I decided to make her pink
<TOY_PON3> I liek pink :3
<bartsonic> lol
<Wrek> 05need reference for the dancers
<KernelCobb> Saturn: they're own energies intertwine to give eachother the energy required to continue accelerating?
<MahBoi777> because......because......magic
<TOY_PON3> ^
<SolarColt> pink celestia = cadence?
<Saturn> 08,01KernelCobb: oh, you mean the protons that are being collided?
<Rain> what dancers Wrek?
<TOY_PON3> SolarColt: I am surprised as well
<KernelCobb> Saturn: the bipolar magnets and quadropole magnets acting together to continue to accelerate
<PinkySpice> whos wrek?
<TOY_PON3> I am no Candence!
<TOY_PON3> Cadence*
<Smoker> so, im being held hostage at my friends house, and she is making me watch the Blues Brothers
<Rain> PinkySpice he is a mod here
<bartsonic> the toys look pretty cool
<PinkySpice> ah
<Saturn> 08,01KernelCobb: oh, the magnets don't move
<Rain> he is also the one drawing\
<TOY_PON3> Oh hi Rain ^^
<PinkySpice> nice~
<Saturn> 08,01KernelCobb: they're electromagnets
<SolarColt> what are you saying TOY_PON3 >_<
<CrossChop114> Dead Space + Pinkie?
<KernelCobb> Saturn: OH
<MahBoi777> Smoker: SOUL MAN
<Saturn> 08,01so the magnetic fields move, but the magnets themselves are stationary
<KernelCobb> Saturn: i assumed the particles themselves are the magnets...i don't know why
<TOY_PON3> That I am a toy pony so technically I can be any toy that's a pony :3
<PinkySpice> one arm looks akward to me
<KernelCobb> Saturn: so like a bullet train?
*Vinyl takes off the lurk cloak
<bartsonic> omg has anyone seen the spike from the original series
<TOY_PON3> I can even be a glow-in-the-dark Zebra
<PinkySpice> nevermind
<Jim> Or a pony that's a toy?
<Smoker> cloak of lurking
<MahBoi777> ohai SolarColt
<SolarColt> sure lets go with that lol xD
<Saturn> 08,01KernelCobb: the particles are charged, so when they move, they exhibit a magnetic fielt
<CrossChop114> Yesh
<TOY_PON3> Jim: That too
<Saturn> 08,01yeah, kinda
<MahBoi777> a wind-up toy pony
<TOY_PON3> MahBoi777: Sure...
<SolarColt> hello again baby devourer :3 aka (mahboi)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14hmm, don't think I've heard this one before
<Sumica> 00,10which part did you want reffrence from wrek?
<Wrek> 05dunno
<flutter_spin> Oh not this conversation again
<bartsonic> he looks so weird than again everypony looked weird in that series
<Saturn> 08,01the particles are actually arranged in a beam, and the beam is arranged into 'bunches'
<KernelCobb> Saturn: so the charged particles give off their own magnetic field, stationary magnets are acting along with this field to push and pull the particles threw the tube
<Rain> Wrek Twilight is best pony
<Dashie_Dashie|TF2> This is Saturn in a nutshell xD http://i.imgur.com/PCWGb.jpg
<MahBoi777> SolarColt: I do NOT eat babies! TT_TT
<CrossChop114> I could see a Pony version of The Nutcracker coming next Christmas. With Pinkie Pie. :I
<Saturn> 08,01KernelCobb: yup
<TOY_PON3> Dashie_Dashie|TF2: :D
<CrossChop114> SO MUCH PINKIE
<KernelCobb> Saturn: incredible
<SolarColt> ohhh sorry to make that horrible assumption MahBoi777 :(
<TrixieMuffin> The LHC is the Hi-tech version of smashing two rocks together to see whats inside
<Jim> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/rsz/mlfw1743_large.jpg
<SolarColt> so that must mean you eat children?
<Saturn> 08,01KernelCobb: and it all needs to be aligned in 3 dimensions very accurately
<MahBoi777> FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<TOY_PON3> Jim: I wish Derpy was my professor :(
<SolarColt> :D
<Rain> Wrek, her arms are kinda thin dont you thing?
<Midnight_Fire> gonna go get a quick shower and start some food. be back in a bit
<Vinyl> ta ta Midnight_Fire~
<dshannon> where be the tail?
<Jim> Derpy is best professor
<TOY_PON3> later Midnight_Fire
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Saturn> 08,01KernelCobb: i was about to give you a link to the LHC wiki i host, but i just realised that it's broken
<bartsonic> derpy is best pony
<Jim> bai Midnight_Fire
<Saturn> 08,012 secs and i'll fix it and send you the link
<KernelCobb> Saturn: that's unfortunate
<KernelCobb> Saturn: kk
<Wrek> 05this is my favorite zz top song btw
<Rain> ^
<Wrek> 05and maybe rain
<KernelCobb> Wrek: give her the element of harmony crown
<SaxyPretender> 0,14which song is it, Wrek?
<Rain> that takes away from it KernelCobb
<bartsonic> g1 spike http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/_img/chars/char_12201.jpg
<Wrek> 05penthouse eyes
<KernelCobb> rain i don't really understand what it is
<KernelCobb> besides twilight
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah, I'll have to check if that's on the Greatest Hits album
<Rain> it
<Rain> as in, the image
<SolarColt> i personally like the drawing
<KernelCobb> the image, or the idea the image represents?
<Rain> I do to
<CrossChop114> :p
<TOY_PON3> Wrek: Me gusta
<IronSights> penthouse eyes?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Well this is good http://i44.tinypic.com/jjwls4.png , and this as cutie mark http://i42.tinypic.com/20av5w9.jpg or something close to that
<IronSights> sounds like a serious condition
<Rain> are you implying something KernelCobb? :3c
<TOY_PON3> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Nice ^^
<CrossChop114> :p
<KernelCobb> Rain: absolutely not
<CrossChop114> :p
<CrossChop114> SO MUCH PINKIE
<CrossChop114> I could see a Pony version of The Nutcracker coming next Christmas. With Pinkie Pie. :I
<CrossChop114> :p
<CrossChop114> lol
<IronSights> :3c
<TOY_PON3> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Y U no Indian Stallone pony?! :P
<IronSights> is Quill here
<bartsonic> pinkie pies songs best songs
<KernelCobb> Rain: i knew where you are going with that and i personally stay as far away from that as possible. nuf said, no need to bring it up
<IronSights> QUILL!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> because i'm not that good
<TOY_PON3> lol It's okay I still like your OC ^^
<IronSights> dont sell yourself short
<Rain> :p
<KernelCobb> ;)
<TOY_PON3> Though the cutiemark would be hard to draw..
<MahBoi777> great OC TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<IronSights> KernelCobb, is a loose cannon, but a damn good cop
<SaxyPretender> 0,14looks awesome Wrek, just needs the sari XD
<KernelCobb> uhh...thanks?
<KernelCobb> idgi
<CriticKitten> Saxy: Inorite
<TOY_PON3> idgi as in I don't get it or I do get it? :P
<TOY_PON3> lol
<KernelCobb> no one would state "i do get it"
<Mutterguy> and the sari will be the hard bit
<MahBoi777> idgi.....I should use that
<Rain> sari?
<KernelCobb> unless english was their 3rd language
<TOY_PON3> KernelCobb: idgi
<TOY_PON3> :3
<MahBoi777> lol

<Mutterguy> Indian dress... think Bollywood
<TOY_PON3> lol
<otakon> ioh
<otakon> okay thank you
<bartsonic> ... toy aisles are sectioned in boy toys or girl toys why is there no neutral aisle with mlp toys
<Mutterguy> well more like a robe or wrapping

<Randomnerd> Hello MahBoi777
<CrossChop114> Back. I had to leave for a sec
<KernelCobb> Rain: why not rain?
<TOY_PON3> lol
<flutter_spin> Do it like from the movie. Dress her up in a dress.
<KernelCobb> Rain: sorry, i'm just a smartplot
<flutter_spin> lol. Dress... I crack myself up.
<IronSights> mine is an iron sight.

*TOY_PON3 is a complete smartplot
<IronSights> XD
<TOY_PON3> KernelCobb: idgi
<Mutterguy> why not a pair of fluffy pink manacles? nah.... that'd be lyra
<MahBoi777> lol
<KernelCobb> Rain: being a smarta(yay)s by telling you your cutie mark should be rain
<Dashie_Dashie|TF2> That has to be Wrek steam.. I'm not getting any messages @_@

<TOY_PON3> I liek Rain's cutiemark :3
<Sumica> 00,10Oh that was cool looking who ever it was
<IronSights> rain is a good looking pony

<Cavy> Need to kill time while waiting for Equestria: Total War =P
<SaxyPretender> 0,14All in all, I enjoyed Past Sins, there were some parts towards the end that made me cringe, but I liked it.
<MirrorImage> Cavy - i enjoyed it; i would consider it worth the read
<unfoundbug> oh wow
<otakon> had to go to the public Library to watch the new ep
<Sumica> 00,10I realy like her mane
<otakon> but it was worth it
<RaveBrony> Woah!! I look down at my paper for a spilt seond and now so many people chatting O.O
<unfoundbug> everypone look at the stream!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...dat mane
<LadyCanary> Looking pretty Wrek :3
<otakon> also
<TOY_PON3> like I said I love her mane ^^
<CrossChop114> I REALLY LIKE HER MA*squee*ANE
<Cavy> It's Dark, then? I'd assume so, but.
<RaveBrony> :D
<LadyCanary> Now I really wanna try my Black Canary cosplay again.
<MirrorImage> yes, but not grimdark
<otakon> I am NOT happy with the damn timeslot change
<RaveBrony> :(
<Placebo> otakon: Wut?
<Sumica> 00,10past sins was predictable, but that's not a bad thing.
<otakon> I need to get proper internet before then
<MirrorImage> it's certainly no darker than Harry Potter was pre-Book 5
<RaveBrony> its at 1pm now right?
<SolarColt> otakon: what time slot change?!
<Cavy> Hmm..
<otakon> Placebo: bc my net is very finicky
<TOY_PON3> LadyCanary: Oh are you talking about the one have on your DA?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, tropes aren't bad if you use them effectively
<otakon> SolarColt: MLP is moving to 1 pm EST come March
<CrossChop114> YAY
<Placebo> I'm okay with that.
<unfoundbug> how is that a bad thing?
<Cavy> Sorry, my Reading Rainbow instincts are kicking in >.>
<MirrorImage> reading rainbow instincts?
<LadyCanary> Yes. That one TOY_PON3. But I need to get a better wig. Because the one I wore was from a friend since my inital wig made me look like a Hansen brother.
<Placebo> ^ lol
<Cavy> My interest levels are kept on how often I see Rainbow Dash. Not always, but quite a bit.
<SolarColt> otakon: what were you saying about a time slot change? i got disconnected
<TOY_PON3> LadyCanary: Looks nice either way to be honest ^^
<Cavy> Ask Placebo.
<Cavy> =P
<MirrorImage> well this story certainly focuses more on Twilight than it does Dash
<CrossChop114> Mew! I AM NOW A CAT ON A PONY STREAM.
<TOY_PON3> Placebo: <3
<Ask_Placebo> Yes?
<otakon> SolarColt: March, 1 pm ponies then on
<LadyCanary> But soon...I might wanna work on my Photo Finish cosplay D: D: And thanks TOY_PON3!
<Cavy> I could guess that, Mirror =P
<TOY_PON3> LadyCanary: Your welcome :P
<TOY_PON3> And good luck on that
*Ask_Placebo puffs on pipe
<SolarColt> is it still two episodes like 1-2pm otakon ?

<Krakass> CrossChop114, I know you're not really a cat because you type nothing like my cat.
<MirrorImage> SolarColt - the new schedule is New Episode @1EST, rerun episode @130EST
<otakon> SolarColt: I think so, check EqD for details
<Wrek> 05why do i always perform the best when im completly exhaused?
<Cavy> Just curious to how often we see her here. I just tend to enjoy the dialog people write for her.
<SolarColt> okay thanks guys
<dshannon> Wrek.... why are you so damn good?!
<CrossChop114> You're right. Whe a cat walks on my keyboard, it's like "jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrxsssssxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
<MirrorImage> Cavy - i dont believe she shows up much
<TOY_PON3> Wrek haz skillz :3
<MirrorImage> she's just there mostly to remind people "Hey, this is Friendship is Magic we're talking about"
<Cavy> Not that big of a deal. Was just curious.
<Placebo> I'm going to write Cavy a fic that has every other word as "Rainbow"
<Cavy> Pff...

<Bronyzilla> Something like that.
<CountDoofus> hope to fly ;)
<MASF123> "Cross my heart, hope to fly stick a cupcake in my eye" is the MLP version
<xles> Always forget that mid section.
<xles> Because you know, making pinkie promises can be dangerous.
<CountDoofus> unless you're Twilight, then it's "cupcake in my -AUGH!"
<Bronyzilla> :

<MASF123> Some group on Favebook started it. I'm just doing as told.
<MASF123> Facebook
<Flutteryay21> ok cool
<CountDoofus> what time does an episode air normally?
<MASF123> Hold up, I got it here:
<MASF123> Derpy Day March 1st has become known as the "Derpy Day" due to a group started on Facebook. It can be celebrated by: •Eating muffins •Wearing gray •Making derpy eyes in mirrors and photos •Delivering letter by hand
<Sumica> 00,10eps ar normaly at 10Am est
<Sumica> 00,10but they bumped it back to 1pm
<Flutteryay21> lol
<gold> wear gray? oooohhhh my dad already calls me derpy!
<MASF123> I'm gonna celebrate Derpy Day, but will feel left out, not many bronies know about it. :(
<Flutteryay21> aww
<CountDoofus> so that's 7PM local time. sweet
<MASF123> Haha he calls you Derpy! Too funny. :D
<Flutteryay21> :)
<gold> and all my gray pants have holes in them
<Flutteryay21> lol
<gold> [!]
<MASF123> I only gonna wear a grey hoodie. I normally wear it too.
<gold> duck tap!
<Kammerjunk> Out of the way! It's a busy day, and nothing's on my mind. For want of the price of tea and a slice, the old man died.
<Kammerjunk> I am so good at killing the chat.
<gold> should i die my hair yellow?
<MASF123> Gonna eat 1 muffin on Derpy Day. And change my current Facebook pic with me posing with a Derpy eyes.
<CountDoofus> trying to imagine that as a cutie mark
<Kammerjunk> Go for it.
<Kammerjunk> gold: Depends on your hair, really, but I say go for it.
<MASF123> Deliver mail by hand, not so much. I could try but with e-mails who really needs mail delivered by hand?
<Kammerjunk> Mail as in just letters?
<MASF123> Yes, deliver your letters by hand.
<Kammerjunk> That's silly.
<CountDoofus> we should totally take pictures of ourselves on Derpy Day and upload it somewhere
<MASF123> •Eating muffins•Wearing gray•Making derpy eyes in mirrors and photos•Delivering letter by hand
<Kammerjunk> I totally shouldn't.
<gold> i'll just fly to towns to give people mail ;)
<CountDoofus> *schoolgirl moment*
<Flutteryay21> XD
<Kammerjunk> I try to avoid cameras whenever possible.
<MASF123> I'm changing my profile pic on Facebook with Derpy poses
*Globetrotter takes a picture of Kammerjunk "Cheese!"
<gold> i'll edit my pic right now!
<Kammerjunk> Ha! I had prepared for this with a DECOY.
<Kammerjunk> But I'll take the cheese.
<MASF123> No, you have to make the poses yourself. No photoshopping
<MASF123> I am hoping that the word goes around before Marh 1st arrives.
<MASF123> March
<MASF123> •Eating muffins•Wearing gray•Making derpy eyes in mirrors and photos•Delivering letter by hand
<Globetrotter> March 1st?
<MASF123> Copy, paste, or remember.
<Kammerjunk> I'm hoping I can avoid cameras 'till then. My friend whom I converted likes to surprise me with these things.
<MASF123> Yes March 1st
<Globetrotter> How did derpy day come into being?
<Globetrotter> When did...?
<Bronyzilla> What is this Derpy Day? :P
<MASF123> A group on Facebook started it, I'm not sure when they made it
<Bronyzilla> Ah, alright.
<MASF123> I think I read it on know your meme.com
<Kammerjunk> Ugh, I can't find a .pdf of "On a Pale Horse" anywhere.
<Kammerjunk> Or rather, not one with any seeds.
<MASF123> •Eating muffins•Wearing gray•Making derpy eyes in mirrors and photos•Delivering letter by hand
<MASF123> I feel like a billboard. :[
<Bronyzilla> I just read about it on Equestria Daily. It looks awesome!
<MASF123> Wait, send me the link!
<Bronyzilla> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/02/derpy-hooves-day.html
<gold> derpy me looks dumb
<Bronyzilla> c:
<Bronyzilla> I might just try to go cross-eyed all day.
<Bronyzilla> And eat MUFFINS!
<Phase4> gold: :<
<gold> 6_9
<valoreins> KwakLad: thanks for the fave on DA! :D
<TOY_PON3> mfw when I heard about Derpy Day http://i43.tinypic.com/2pyt1dl.jpg
<KwakLad> Haha its cool valoriens i do like it afterall
<Dark_Horst> didn't we have that one since last year?
<CountDoofus> heck, I can't put on a Derpy look. best I can do is cross-eyed
<xles> Bollywood sly is best sly.
<gold> my eyes are small so i had to make them big like derpy's eyes, which looks weird
<MASF123> I can do the Derpy eyes, but my eyes aren't big
<gold> i edited a pic
<MASF123> Eh...
<Bronyzilla> :3
<gold> the pic that's on my trainer card :$
<valoreins> how come my streaming is super laggy more than usual..? refresh!
<TOY_PON3> Indian Stallone ftw
<MASF123> SB went to sleep
<Bronyzilla> There is no stream at present, I think.
<MASF123> No steaming as of now
<valoreins> oh..
<Bronyzilla> Which is Undeniably, unquestionably, UNCOOL.
<MASF123> But Daring Do isn't
<valoreins> ok, back to eating fried scootaloo again
<Bronyzilla> :3
<Bronyzilla> Daring Do is epix.
<MASF123> Mmm...Fried Scootaloo.
<TOY_PON3> Well I'm tired, I need sleep so goodnight everypony ^^
<xles> nomnom
<Bronyzilla> Scootaloo is annoying, so I approve of frying her.

<MASF123> She is not annoying
<Bronyzilla> G'night TOY_PON3
<MASF123> night TOY_PON3
<Bronyzilla> She sometimes is.
<TOY_PON3> take care guys
<KwakLad> i dont find scootaloo annoying she just doesnt interest me
<MASF123> Yeah
<Bronyzilla> Yeah, I suppose.
<valoreins> TOY_PON3: bye XD
<CountDoofus> the CMC won some points in Hearts and Hooves Day for me
<Bronyzilla> :3
<MASF123> Daring Do looks like an Indiana Jones mix of RD with alternate colors.
<KwakLad> yeah that was a fun ep and the song was really well done
<MASF123> Simply Awesome.
<CountDoofus> ugh, trying to draw the back of a pony's head without reference points is a pain
<CountDoofus> mane-wise
<MASF123> I can't draw anypony
<KwakLad> MASF123: there is a cartoon about RD meeting daring doo, and daring saying that RD got the colour scheme all wrong... ill try to find it
<Bronyzilla> Lol.
<valoreins> it's easy just start with a circle < hint
<MASF123> hint hint
<Bronyzilla> I'll need plenty of practice before actually drawing them perfectly.
<Bronyzilla> :P
<MASF123> He is still searching is see...
<MASF123> I see
<valoreins> come to think of it, i never submit pony drawing, just humanized... :p
<MASF123> I don't like them humanized...
<Bronyzilla> I have to say that I'm not too fond of humanized ponies...
<Bronyzilla> It just takes away... cuteness. :3
<MASF123> Also, it is just plain weird.
<gold> now derpy is the pic on my trainer card 6_9
<MASF123> Haha
<Bronyzilla> :3
<valoreins> i know
<xles> I have derpy on my jurassic park ID badge. =P

<valoreins> http://valornomad.deviantart.com/#/d4oe0ez
<KwakLad> http://toxic-mario.deviantart.com/art/Book-Signing-284135208
<MASF123> I'll check it out...
<KwakLad> sorry i took my time
<MASF123> Eh, valoriens good drawing, but...
<Bronyzilla> Lol!
<valoreins> my aim is not cuteness when drawing DX
<Bronyzilla> I like that cartoon.
<MASF123> Haha nice comic KwakLad
<KwakLad> Bronyzilla: yeah i thought it was good especially the unimpressed look RD has
<Bronyzilla> It looks so professional too...
<Bronyzilla> Me Gusta.
<MASF123> Very close to the real deal
<KwakLad> It might be proffessional, i dont know if Toxic-Mario is proffesional or not
<Bronyzilla> Yeah...
<MASF123> Not pro, but is still great
<Bronyzilla> Brb.
<MASF123> Rainbow Dash was reading Daring Doo in the new episode.
<xles> Three more hours to spoiler time, you can do it. ;)
<valoreins> but was it the new volume? i forgot :s
<KwakLad> xles spoiler time?
<CountDoofus> trying to find an image of the back of Vinyl Scratch's head, but I'm afraid to type in "Vinyl Scratch from behind" in google...
<KwakLad> oh when we are allowed to talk about it?
<valoreins> careful it's a trap
<xles> KwakLad: yeah
<KwakLad> okay
<MASF123> Vinyl Scratch concept art?
<Starflash> whoa valoreins o.o what did you use to make that human RD
<valoreins> adding something wiht "from behind" gives you a risk to be thrown into the abyss of 34
<Scavender> Its clean even with safesearch off ;)
<Starflash> looks awesome o.o
<valoreins> Starflash: just photoshop
<valoreins> it's all thanks to my good ol graphic tablet

<r41nb0wd4sh> i take the "the" out of psychotherapist
<r41nb0wd4sh> 6_9
<valoreins> tribes ascend... i think i heard that somewhere...
<CountDoofus> I wonder if I should get a pony tattoo... being a brony is nice and all, but who can honestly say it's going to last for the rest of his/her life...
<CountDoofus> and hi Reaper
<Reaper> Well hello
<KwakLad> Total biscuit hypes Tribes Ascend quite alot
<Bronyzilla> I wouldn't get a tatoo.

<derpy_pony> I don't think I will ever get a tatoo...things I did 10 years ago mostly look quite stupid...I don't want such a cenotaph of stupidity on my skin forever
<KwakLad> so you can pass it off as 'yeah im just really into music' if you have a pair of notes
<MASF123> Twilight's creepy laugh. Lol.

<xles> Of course they do.
<Bronyzilla> Hope not.
<MASF123> Rainbow Dash looks like she own a bong
<Bronyzilla> Yeeeeeah...
<xles> Well considering that ponies are confirmed to do harder drugs than THC, namely alcohol (at least in the form of cider), it'd be logical to assume they'd do lesser drugs as well.
<MASF123> The colors. @_@
<valoreins> everpony imma sleep now :D
<MASF123> She's got the muchies.
<valoreins> niight
<Bronyzilla> Can somepony get a stream going? I'm getting tired.

<KwakLad> EspyLacopa: well not happy pinkie, because she wasnt psycho when she was a little filly
<CountDoofus> nah, there's none
<CountDoofus> no stream I mean
<CCCP> Does any pony know any good remixes???

<Bronyzilla> Lol.
<twenty> wow
<Bronyzilla> I might write a fanfic soon.
<CrossChop114> lol
<Bronyzilla> I'm not sure though...
<twenty> I read a Doctor Whoof one. It was sad and it made me dislike the real series because the doctor is always running away.
<Midnight_Fire> Was I the only one who just saw that?
<twenty> saw what?
<Bronyzilla> ?
<CrossChop114> I don't write fanfics. I make crappy original cartoons.
<CrossChop114> :(
<Bronyzilla> 3:
<CountDoofus> I got a fanfiction in mind too, but still working on another one based on the movie Rio
<Midnight_Fire> Chat is acting weird
<twenty> O_o
<Midnight_Fire> maybe it's just my end
<Bronyzilla> Yeah- most likely.
<twenty> I got this chick from my school to like Doctor Whof, but she is still far away from liking the show. :/
<CrossChop114> lol
<Bronyzilla> Heh.
<twenty> She saw docto whooves and was saying that he looked so "cute"
<Midnight_Fire> show her more cute ponies
<Bronyzilla> I tried bronifying my mate, the conversion failed. He remains neutral.

<Midnight_Fire> So far I've only convinced one person to give the show a chance. He says he can respect it and that it has quality, but it's not his sort of thing
<CrossChop114> Not that I don't like her.

<CrossChop114> :/
<Assist_King> oh god, just gone through 120 deviant art
<Bronyzilla> [Which is good c:]
<CountDoofus> not to sound insensitive, but what am I looking at?
<Assist_King> then 5 stories updated
<PinkiePieCopy> I see buffering
<Assist_King> bornies why you make so much stuff
<CountDoofus> I'm not familiar with the anime scene
<CrossChop114> It's just a bunch of characters... I don't think I'm that good.
<CrossChop114> :/
<CrossChop114> * characters I made
<PinkiePieCopy> Oh that is actually good
<PinkiePieCopy> better than I can do
<CountDoofus> all OC's then? not bad, not bad at all
<PinkiePieCopy> Especially with ponies
<PinkiePieCopy> However...
<PinkiePieCopy> I find your lack of ponies disturbing
<CrossChop114> I haven't drawn ponies yet. I feel that I'm not very good at drawing them.
<PinkiePieCopy> Just try it
<Midnight_Fire1> I drew one pony. It came out terrible.
<PinkiePieCopy> The 2nd time I tried it came out well
<PinkiePieCopy> Because I was looking back at Pinkie pie
<PinkiePieCopy> And looking back at my art and drawing something different
<CrossChop114> I also don't have Photoshop or Illustrator at home. The only way I post things at home is on Flipnote Hatena. :(
<PinkiePieCopy> -idea-
<PinkiePieCopy> HYE
<PinkiePieCopy> HEY
<CountDoofus> I tried drawing Twilight from memory once.... burned it
<Scavender> Today, after 7day snowing a sun came out, the scenery out here is marvelous.
<PinkiePieCopy> I HAVE AN IDEA. TYPE IN PAINT AND SELECT THE FIRST OPTION
<CrossChop114> My laptop doesn't have a disk drive, either so, I can't get a USB tablet.
<CrossChop114> Huh?
<PinkiePieCopy> Type in paint on google and select the first option
<PinkiePieCopy> It's fullproof
<CrossChop114> Why? I can't even draw well without a tablet.
<PinkiePieCopy> http://www.tumblr.com/photo/1280/askthebronyman/17883071219/1/tumblr_lznaiw6wKd1rpmfv2
<PinkiePieCopy> I drew that with it
<PinkiePieCopy> Convinced?
<CrossChop114> :/
<CrossChop114> Sigh... FINE
<PinkiePieCopy> That's the 2nd pony I drew
<PinkiePieCopy> In my life
<Bronyzilla> That's pretty good for a start.
<PinkiePieCopy> Thanks
<Bronyzilla> Most of my ponies end up to be blobs with eyes.
<CountDoofus> hehe
<PinkiePieCopy> ...
<Midnight_Fire1> First drawings I suppose are supposed to be less than stellar
<PinkiePieCopy> So you make chubbies?
<Midnight_Fire1> I suppose
<Midnight_Fire1> Mine was
<CrossChop114> I can't find what you're trying to show me.
<Bronyzilla> I don't intend to do it. :P
<CrossChop114> I'll just draw and post one on Flipnote Hatena.
<CrossChop114> It's easy on the DS.
<PinkiePieCopy> It's easier on the program
<PinkiePieCopy> you just select any colour
<PinkiePieCopy> and draw
<PinkiePieCopy> on the DS you only have 2 colour options
<CrossChop114> Yeah
<CrossChop114> I can't find what program you're talking about.
<PinkiePieCopy> Limiting you extremely
<CountDoofus> I'm wondering if I should get a tablet... not really sure if I intend to keep drawing for a long time
<CountDoofus> http://www.getpaint.net/ this, by any chance?
<PinkiePieCopy> Type in Paint Program and the first option you see will say Sketch and Paint
<PinkiePieCopy> or something
<CrossChop114> Okeez
<PinkiePieCopy> http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=paint%20program&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CD0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onemotion.com%2Fflash%2Fsketch-paint%2F&ei=GBVBT8q4D8jOgAf4jY3xBw&usg=AFQjCNEL1ZhPhCpUezPDXRGURc_4NyhwfA

<CrossChop114> Found it.
<PinkiePieCopy> I posted the link

<StinkomanFan> I mean, the witches sing a song about working together and the ponies drive a kid out of town
<xles> It's end of show +24:09, Can we talk about the new episode now?
<StinkomanFan> I think the writers screwed up the script
<CrazyBronyDonut> i enjoyed the felt animation
<CrossChop114> IT WAS AWESOME
<StinkomanFan> And then there was the scene with the Floom :s Not sure how to feel about that one

<Tom> Episode 19 of season 2 "Putting Your Hoof Down" airs in 13 days, 2 hours, 19 minutes, 12 seconds (Mar 03 2012 18:00:00 GMT)
<ThatsAShinySky> awesome!

<StinkomanFan> 2 weeks
<unfoundbug> NOOOOOOO
<CrazyBronyDonut> fluttershy ep
<unfoundbug> no ponies this week ?
<ThatsAShinySky> OH MY GOD
<ThatsAShinySky> FLUTTERSHY EPISODE?
<NewDCD> 9,1 I like Danny. As in Megan's brother. He's like a kid who would grow into a Super Robot pilot but in the wrong show.
<CrossChop114> FLUTTERSHY EPISODE FINALLY
<ThatsAShinySky> unfound, there already was one
<Scavender> BRB gonna grab some snack.
<ThatsAShinySky> Friend in Deed, it was a Pinkie episode
<StinkomanFan> Danny's an asshole
<unfoundbug> as in they are missing a saturday
<ThatsAShinySky> it got released saturday
<CrazyBronyDonut> what else am i supposed to do on a saturday morning???
<unfoundbug> there was a friend in deed one sat
<NewDCD> 9,1Danny reminds me of a younger, immature Kouji Kabuto.
<CountDoofus> this might help for some beginning drawers (and I mean people that draw, not underwear): http://www.dragoart.com/tuts/8102/1/1/how-to-draw-my-little-pony,-friendship-is-magic-style.htm
<StinkomanFan> I think he and Surprise are a good match up though, A dick and the prototype Pinkie Pie
<Syndicate> Did anypony else notice that when Pinkie shook doodle's snow globe that Derpy Hooves was inside.
<alexxm> i did
<CrazyBronyDonut> eeyup
<CrossChop114> I think Fluttershy's gonna become a badass, realize that she isn't meant to be one after she yells at a friend or something, then she goes back to her shy self. That's just my prediction.
<CrazyBronyDonut> the song was amazing
<CountDoofus> I didn't, I thougt I saw Derpy in the crowd during Pinkie's song, but was wrong :(
<StinkomanFan> Then again, I've only seen one episode and the movie, so it may just deteriorate before my eyes
<Iwubponiez> there was derpy in that episode
<CrazyBronyDonut> pinkie also shattered physics many many times
<StinkomanFan> I pray G4 doesn't get a movie, because then I'd never get to see it :'(
<NewDCD> 9,1So Shy becomes a mecha pilot? Me goosta.
<CountDoofus|TF2> anyway, ganna play some TF2
