<Yahooz> see ya Pegasister16
<Tovler> 8/10. It was ok, I guess.
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: Not good enough.
<Dken2021> oh later Pegasister16

<LordDerpington> Gumri - no Apple devices besides their computers support 1080p.

<LordDerpington> AppleTV, 720p. iPhone and iPad, not even that.
<TOY_PON3> ^
<Meanwhile> Well when you say "night" and leave out the name of whoever you're saying night to it's easy to misunderstand.
<emangamer> c'mon Yahooz
<Kammerjunk> Well, I've had a terrible headache the entire day, but this episode was worth it.
<Tovler> Now to enjoy this episode for 2 weeeks.
<Gumri> LordDerpington: but what if i want the episodes on my pc?
<Yahooz> I BLEW IT D=
<IshBestPony> lets see, Read it and Weep can describe becoming a Brony, Hearts and Hooves Day can describe shipping, and the new episode can describe trying too hard to convert people to Bronyism and failing
<TOY_PON3> Tovler: I can't wait.....
<Saturn> 08,01oh poop, i forgot about the pony episode
<Pegasister16> I was saying Nitey-Nite to Phase4!
<NullRadix> IshBestPony: except it leaves the part out about failing
<LordDerpington> Gumri: well, Apple's attitude is "tough luck". :(
<emangamer> IshBestPony: except for the ending it would have made sense...I still think the ending was phoned in
<Tovler> Will Iron Will be voiced by Will Smith? I guess we'll find out.
<TOY_PON3> IshBestPony: It makes sense..softof
<Saturn> 08,01guess who forgot about the pony episode today...
<NullRadix> Pinkie technically succeeded in converting him in the end, even if he's still an introvert
<Gumri> mhmm therefore i am forced to get it off youtube
<emangamer> seriously it would ahve been such a better episode if it was the mayor...
<Meanwhile> emangamer: you just annoyed that it wasn't the mayor.
<Big_Jakeintosh> If the itunes versions where 1080p and not infested with drm I would happily buy them
<TOY_PON3> Saturn: Sorry to hear that
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Omg ep 21 sounds awesome
<NullRadix> Saturn: ABANDON SHIP! SPOILERS AHEAD

<Dermathil> also, mods, just telling you this: YOU FUCKED UP.

*Pegasister16 <3s being an egghead
<StinkomanFan> And Sumica IGNORED ME ASKING FOR HELP
<TOY_PON3> :(
<LordDerpington> Mane chat was too fast to hold decent conversations during live premieres anyway.
<emangamer> Yahooz: I was being serious....you can get banned for that
<Dermathil> This is the WORST THING EVER since I joined Bronystate.
<otakon> Dermathil: calm down and register your complaint on official channels
<Yahooz> I know XD
<emangamer> Pegasister16 is best egghead
<Dken2021> what Dermathil ?
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: I'm ignoring you being ignored when asking for help.

<Dermathil> otakon, THIS IS AN OFFICIAL CHANNEL.
<otakon> Yahooz: it's true, I got kicked for that very same joke
*Pegasister16 is flattered =3
<Apokalipse> Derm calm down xD
<fluttercry> 05,15Dermathil so sorry we can't cater to your every whim
<Tovler> Humpty Hump is best egghead
<TOY_PON3> Dermathil: If you must cry, cry
<TOY_PON3> it's okay
<Meanwhile> Don't tell Dermathil to calm down, he can't.
<Yahooz> I understand what you can and cant get banned for
*Tovler does the humpty dance
<Meanwhile> Just let him work it out on his own.
<otakon> Dermathil: I mean email them with a concise organized NON raging letter on why this is a bad decision
<StinkomanFan> And then when I got to a different stream My computer crashed!
<Dken2021> what's wrong Dermathil ?
<StinkomanFan> FOR TEN FUCKING MINUTES
<Dermathil> fluttercry: at least learn to listen to the goddamn complaints from the important members...
*Pegasister16 joins Tovler
<TOY_PON3> so much rage >.>
<otakon> Dken2021: he's upset the manechat is closed on the weekend
<Gumri> RPG Shooter. whut
*TOY_PON3 joins Pegasister16 and Tovler

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^
<Gumri> of course he did. I'm an idiot :P
<Yahooz> except for the staff
*Pegasister16 plays the Humpty Hump song from her iPod

<Dken2021> also, whitney houston died
<LordCelestia> 0,5No, Yahooz, staff vs. viewer means nothing either

<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: no one else cares enough to mock you about it.
<StinkomanFan> I ASKED SUMICA TO FIX MY STREAM FIVE TIMES LORDCELESTIA
<otakon> see ya Gumri
<StinkomanFan> FIVE FUCKING TIMES
<Gumri> I'm not going anywhere?
<emangamer> My father just gave me the "what the fuck are you watching this for" speech
<fluttercry> 05,15StinkomanFan it's not his fault if he can't make it just happen
<Dermathil> eh. Cyall friday next week. Even then I'm not sure I'm going to show up. Because this OBVIOUS BULLSHIT is 100% crap. The chats are STILL going to be slow, and mane chat is the funniest of them all. Also, I DONT WANT to login on all six sidechats to read what everyone has to say about shit.
<Apokalipse> Should have asked a sixth time dude
<Yahooz> StinkomanFan: YOU are supposed to refresh if that happens. NOT Sumica
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer: go on...
*Pegasister16 pities emangamer
<TOY_PON3> StinkomanFan: Wait till Eurostream
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: exactly what do you expect Sumica to do about YOUR stream?
<StinkomanFan> I TRIED REFRESHING
<Saturn> 08,01what was your response?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Calm down!
<StinkomanFan> He didn't respond!
<Saturn> 08,01and what was his response to that?
<TOY_PON3> StinkomanFan: If you must cry, cry
<TOY_PON3> It's okay
<StinkomanFan> At all!
<fluttercry> 05,15Or you can suck it up Dermathil and be a big boy
<LordCelestia> 0,5God forbid we can't snap our magic fingers and make everyting all better
<Big_Jakeintosh> emangamer: I got that same speech from a few friends of mine recently I politely told them to fuck off
<LordCelestia> 0,5God freaking forbid
<TOY_PON3> ouch..
<Yahooz> Im in an airport loungre right now. Noone give a fuck about what im currently doing XD
<otakon> Dermathil: it's a little unreasonable you know, manechat is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to track on premiere days
<Meanwhile> Big_Jakeintosh: don't think there's a polite way to do that.
<StinkomanFan> So I had to go to a different stream and guess what happened then?
<Meanwhile> Good answer thought.
<StinkomanFan> My computer crashed!
<otakon> Dermathil: but it'll be back up for the weekday
<Dermathil> otakon: heh. I can still read it.
<Yahooz> THE HOW ARE YOU ON IRC?!?!
<Yahooz> *then
<TOY_PON3> Loud noises!
<Tovler> Y u watching ponies? You should be watching Walking Dead or Breaking Bad.
<StinkomanFan> For ten minutes I didn't get to see what happened!
<Saturn> 08,01i don't listen to our viewers.
<emangamer> sorry Saturn I was afk
<Apokalipse> This chat is so intense today
<Dermathil> also, last week it took over an hour AFTER the premiere for it coming back up.
<Big_Jakeintosh> Meanwhile: its not to hard you just gotta choose your words properly :)
<otakon> Yahooz: why do you keep asking me that?
<TOY_PON3> Saturn: nice
<Saturn> 08,01well, that's a lie, i do
<Meanwhile> Big_Jakeintosh: I assumed the words were "fuck off"
<Saturn> 08,01<3
<emangamer> Yea I'm just, "get over it" and he's just like "you eventually need to grow up"
<Yahooz> I was talking to StinkomanFan this time otakon :p
<Gumri> We are ok Yahooz, argueing with the mods :D
<otakon> oh
<TOY_PON3> I believe the words are DEAL WITH IT
<Big_Jakeintosh> Meanwhile: lol no not exactly
<Meanwhile> emangamer: no you don't. Stay grown downed forever.
<Apokalipse> My dad does the same thing about videogames emangamer
<otakon> dat same snore
<Dken2021> Dermathil, just cool it man
<StinkomanFan> Just tell me where I can watch the episode so I don't kill myself
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer: i think i'm living proof that, in fact, you don't.
<Midnight_Fire> So many weird faces in this scene
<Yahooz> ?
<Saturn> 08,01most of us are
<fluttercry> 05,15Dermathil we made this change to spread out the load. When everyone congragates in mane chat, it's almost impossible to keep up
<NullRadix> You have to grow up in some ways, but not others
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> youtube ?
<emangamer> alright well I'm going to go everypony...
<Apokalipse> bye
<otakon> see ya later emangamer
<Meanwhile> Seeya emangamer.

<otakon> hopefully
<TOY_PON3> later emangamer, hopefully everpony cools down when you come back
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ñater emangamer
<Gumri> The mane 6 rooms should always be open
<LordDerpington> Bah, "grown up". It's more grown up to not care about what others think of your viewing habits.
<Pegasister16> emangamer: PLEASEDONTLEAVEME!
<emangamer> TOY_PON3: one can only hope
<TOY_PON3> ^
<Midnight_Fire> bye emangamer
<Yahooz> oh earlier... I thought you meant at that instant XD
<TOY_PON3> lol
<Big_Jakeintosh> LordDerpington: exactly
<emangamer> Pegasister16: :( I'm sorry...
<LordCelestia> 0,5Alright
*emangamer hugs Pegasister16 goodbye
<Gumri> Well i'm going to go now everyone. Bye!
<otakon> heres hoping my internet turns back on today when I get back
<Dermathil> and fluttercry, I been around for longer than you have. you have NO IDEA what kind of changes I've been around to see. And the mane chat is the most important feature of bronystate, almost as important as the movies. Removing it is just like making the movie nights a chatting night.
<LordCelestia> 0,5If people dont stop complaining
*Gumri rolls out of chat
<LordCelestia> 0,5right now
*Meanwhile hands Pegasister16 an emangamer cardboard cutout.
<LordCelestia> 0,5iom muting the damn channel
<StinkomanFan> I'm just so angry :'(
<otakon> bc I'm about to be disconneted
<TOY_PON3> LordCelestia: Please...kick them
<emangamer> LordCelestia: putting the smackdown on some fillies
*Pegasister16 hugs emangamer "You'll still be on the Xbox later, right?"
<HeavyMetalDash> indeed
<LordDerpington> Hope you can make it back for movie night, otakon
<otakon> me too
<Big_Jakeintosh> who's complaining im not
<emangamer> hopefully I will...IDK when though
<Dken2021> Dermathil: you do realize it goes a mile a second right? impossible to have conversation
<otakon> I'm not either
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^
*emangamer hugs LordCelestia "calm down my old friend"
<Saturn> 08,01can i just say: this change to chat was discussed *at great length* in our last meeting. some of you don't seem to see the bigger picture here that *most* people do not like 100mph chat
<otakon> bye guys
<Apokalipse> Derm honestly? Stop pretending like you have the right to a mane chat. The mods can do whatever you want and you can complain, but you're acting like a child
<otakon> I have 50 seconds
<Yahooz> I might have been complaining :p
<Meanwhile> Seeya otakon
<otakon> BYE!
<TOY_PON3> later otakon, take care
<emangamer> bye otakon
<LordDerpington> Take care otakon
<Yahooz> tbh
<Big_Jakeintosh> I say let the mods do what they need to do to keep the chat orderly
<Yahooz> bye otakon
<Tovler> I for one well the changes that are coming in the future.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> See ya otakon
<Midnight_Fire> later otakon
<fluttercry> 05,15Dermathil I don't care how long you've been around. Things change, it's not that big a deal. You can't hold a conversation in mane chat at those speeds
<StinkomanFan> And I can't frigging talk to my parents about it, and the only person who listens to me was Meanwhile, a man who lives eats and breaths hate
<TOY_PON3> I would've complained but I didn't sleep in tday
<Saturn> 08,01if you do, well, i'm sorry, but we've had to slow thing down, for ease of moderation, and to make chat a more pleasant experience for the majority
<Dermathil> egh. Apokalipse, that's why I'm not coming back next week for next episode.
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: you've totally got me all wrong.
<Dermathil> also, have fun watching the episodes. Cyall next movie night.
<Big_Jakeintosh> I never paid attention to the main chat during new episodes it was impossible to keep up with
<Apokalipse> Good, problem solved, hapiness and smiles now, k?
<Tovler> I'm not coming here next saturday morning either.
<Yahooz> see ya Dermathil
<Meanwhile> I don't hate everything, I'm just incredibly sarcastic.
<TOY_PON3> later Dermathil take care bro
<Tovler> eeewwwwww
<Yahooz> Im not going to be on for a whole week :(
*Pegasister16 appreciates Meanwhile's gift
<TOY_PON3> Yahooz: Nuu :(
<StinkomanFan> Just when I thought I was going to be able to like pinkie pie too

<HeavyMetalDash> indeed
<Saturn> 08,01to be perfectly honest, we know that this change is not going to sit well with everypony. we've accepted that, and have still made the change. on the whole, it's working; most people i've spoken to seem to like it more this way
<TOY_PON3> StinkomanFan: I understand you're disappointed but you didn't need to take it out on the mods and the chat..
<Meanwhile> I wonder why Derma feels so self entitled.

<Meanwhile> Hey Nightwing
<Apokalipse> me
<Meanwhile> TOY_PON3: I can do all that.
<Apokalipse> Well I'm not actually using the chat
<Tovler> The Bollywood movie needed more demon hipster chicks.
<Apokalipse> I'm using mIRC
<Big_Jakeintosh> TOY_PON3: I use chrome and no problems here
<Luna> 07,01I love bollywood movies :)
<TOY_PON3> Hold On I'm gonna check something

<Midnight_Fire> Is that your favorite Bollywood movie, Luna?
<HeavyMetalDash> I <3 this episode sooo much
<Big_Jakeintosh> I loved all the continuity in the new episode it was awesome :)

<Tovler> My favorite bollywood movie is Endhiran
<Nightwing> Meanwhile well having virtual keyboard will do that
<Apokalipse> I really love the faces in the recent pony episodes
<Midnight_Fire> My favorite Bollywood movie is Lagaan
<Meanwhile> Why is Pinkie in that house? -_^
<Big_Jakeintosh> I love musicals just not bollywood musicals they just dont do it for me :-/
<Midnight_Fire> I'd have nominated it for B movie, but it's 4 hours long
<StinkomanFan> I cleared my cache and It still won't work
<Nightwing> because she is climbing in your windows snathing your people up
<Tovler> we've seen 4.2 hour long LOTR movies here.
<Apokalipse> That was a special though
<Tovler> er, movie
<Meanwhile> That was the best August ever.
<Midnight_Fire> Not sure if 4 hours of Bollywood would fly as well as LOTR though
<Apokalipse> Try it
<Meanwhile> Probably not.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> first book of the series, 3 place in the shelf
<TOY_PON3> Okay seriously last night Chrome failed on me and now it works..

<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I want my fluttershy episode damn it
<RaveBrony> The episode on today? :D
<Apokalipse> Ahh, discussing the episode right after it airs seems like such a logical thing to do though >.<
<RaveBrony> Yeah, we need a Flutterhy episode badly....
<Tovler> I'm not ready for a Fluttershy episode.
<Owfin> It is for the first half an hour
<Owfin> or so
<TOY_PON3> Does anypony know if you have to have MW3 in order to download the multiplayer on Steam?
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> When will the stream show the new episode?
<OneTrickPony> post cute on Bronystate :3 http://iwsmt.littleasllc.netdna-cdn.com/February-16-2012-19-16-10-XhNZv.gif
<RaveBrony> Smurai Jack is so awesome

<RaveBrony> Daaawww
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> And when will EQD post it?
<Owfin> About that safe time
<Owfin> Same
<Owfin> Bagh
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I didn't relize it till now Lauren Faust has a deviant Art account
<GentleHeaven> dont worry, everyone looses a game of monopoly sometime
<StinkomanFan> Well great, now I feel bad again for pissing off the mods
<Owfin> ?
<jingles> Is there no dialogue in this show?
<TOY_PON3> It says I can download multiplayer but I don't know if you have to buy MW3
<Randomnerd> It's been a rough weekend.
<Vaponyeon> when you play momopoly, we all lose
<jingles> or is this just an ep without much?
<Apokalipse> I never lost a game of monopoly... probably because I never actually finished a game of monopoly
<pinkamina> dont buy it
<Owfin> I just lost the game.
<jingles> Apokalipse, same here XD
<RaveBrony> dat jockie sound O_o
<GentleHeaven> no one has :(
<Apokalipse> It just takes so long xD
<jingles> Ihave won The Game ^_^
<desertman2> You don't need to have MW3, as it's a seperate game
<Tovler> The Spring Season of this episode was my favorite.
<Randomnerd> I liked the episode, that's all I'll say :)
<TOY_PON3> I'm not gonna buy
<Conyst> obsessive leaf collector
<TOY_PON3> thanks desertman2
<jingles> only in Wajas
<GentleHeaven> huh, its broadcasting in 5.1
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I learned one thing from the Last Roundup
<Randomnerd> I'm looking forward to the next one.
<TOY_PON3> well I'm out
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Never ever fucking break a Pinkie Promise
<Owfin> Which was?
<Owfin> Oh
<StinkomanFan> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> She will find you
<StinkomanFan> Dangit tom
<jingles> You shouldn't make a promise unless you're willing to die to keep it
<Owfin> I loved the reveal at the end of that episode
<alexxm> whats this guy doing
<jingles> that's why it's a promise
<Luna> 07,013 march if i'm not mistaken
<PartyPony> me pays Vinyl Scratch to do awesome DJing
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I mainly watched the episode for Derpy
<Tovler> Pinkie's … damn, no spoilers
<PartyPony> /me pays Vinyl Scratch to do awesome djing
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I am still confused on the whole pony genetics thing
<Owfin> I am so mad that nobody cared about applejack... that episode confirmed everything I suspected about Applejack's flaws
*PartyPony wonders why it aint working
<Randomnerd> Nuuuuuu!
<GentleHeaven> its simple using punnet squares
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I cared about Applejack
<jingles> wait, what? That she's stubborn and a bit racist?
<Randomnerd> Oh, well, more time for Fanfic.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> racist?
<Tovler> Derpy and Flim Flam just drowned out AJ
<PartyPony> Lol,how
<Owfin> That she tries to be the perfect pony
<Owfin> Really hard
<jingles> Everyone's a little bit racist :D
<GentleHeaven> flim and flam are my top ponys
<jingles> They all do, they just have different ideas of what a perfect pony is
<Luna> 07,01dat avenue Q
<CountDoofus> I'll be off for a while, toodles everypony
<jingles> I'm pretty sure Twilight is a perfectionist
<Tovler> :( but I'm not racist… I'm a freak
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Flim and Flam reminded me so much of that monorail Simpsons episode
<PartyPony> Somepony doesnt understand the meaning or racist
<jingles> Yes, Yes it is @Luna
<Conyst> this guy is strange
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> did it for anyone else?
<Saturn> 08,01hey guys
<Luna> 07,01hey Saturn
<alexxm> see u CountDoofus
<CountDoofus> hi Saturn <3
<Owfin> But she is really focused on being the perfect pony that everypony loves... I love that kind of thing
<PartyPony> Hi

<jingles> I think I have my episodes mixed up, I was thinking Over A Barrel
<Owfin> Oh
<Owfin> XD
<Saturn> 08,01i'd *really* like to hear your opinions on the changes
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> So did Hasbro ever explain why Derpy became the way she is?
<Owfin> Nope
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> wasn't it a animation error?
<Owfin> Oh yeagh
<alexxm> at first
<Saturn> 08,01your responses will help us in the next staff meeting
<Owfin> I thought you meant backstory
<CCCP> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO I MISSED IT!!!!
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> So can anyone explain what the symbols by peoples names mean?
<CCCP> dont tell me what happedns
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> like the +,%,@ mean
<Tovler> I want to know if Derpy was always supposed to drop an anvil on Twilight's head.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> are they status?
<The_Greener> @ is operator, % is half-operator, + is voice.
<jingles> I wasn't here before the new chat, soooooo no idea what the old one was like
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Fuck your well
<Owfin> I never noticed the new chat, XD
<CCCP> can any one send me a link to the latest ep?
<jingles> Hehehe, I've got status >D
<Tovler> The chat changed?
<desertman2> Usually means mod and stuff
<jingles> Reknowned, Feared, Loved and Wise
<CCCP> please
<bob> Can't wait for pinkie episode
<jingles> Just... not in your City >.>
<GentleHeaven> need applejack song
<CCCP> bob it already aired
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> The synopsis for the Fluttershy Episode is interesting
<Tovler2> hmm, This chat looks the same, eh dear brother of mine?
<Owfin> The pinkie episode was todayu
<Owfin> Yo'
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Ironside tries to help Fluttershy be more assertive
<PartyPony> I want to see that episode
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> That oughtta be fun
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> The twilight episode looks interesting as well
<Owfin> I loved how nobody expected much from Secret of My Excess and it ended up being the best of the season.
<Saturn> 08,018,1hey guys
<Saturn> 08,018,1i've got a (non-mandated) anonymous survey i'd like you to fill out about the changes to chat: http://kwiksurveys.com?s=LINLFO_deb0bea4
<Saturn> 08,018,1i'd *really* like to hear your opinions on the changes
<Saturn> 08,018,1your responses will help us in the next staff meeting
<Tovler> Spike Episode will destroy fanon… of something that doesn't exist.
<jingles> But it was soooo obvious >.>
<Owfin> But it was soooo good
<Midnight_Fire> I didn't expect much from SSCS6K, but it's one of my favorites now
<Owfin> What was that?
<CCCP> The best episode was last round up
<PartyPony> When is the spike episode
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Did Lauren Faust have any involvement with Season 2?
<PartyPony> I didnt see it
<Owfin> Nope
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Silly ponies Spike is rainbowdash
<PartyPony> ...
<Midnight_Fire> I thought Last Roundup was kinda downhill after Derpy
<CCCP> Arceus-pony|Fancy: i think so it says her name at the star of every episode
<Tovler> Lauren was involved with the inception of Princess Cadence.
<Owfin> What is SSCS6K?
<jingles> I gotta say, though, this Samurai Jack thing is pretty.... uhm. uninteresting.
<SuperBrony64|Nap> 10,02See you all at BMN!
<Owfin> Nice music
<Tovler> Last Roundup had a moral that hit close to home.
<jingles> I'VE BEEN SPOILED BY HOW AWESOME PONIES ARE, OKAY?
<Midnight_Fire> Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000
<Owfin> Yeah, great moral
<CCCP> I haven't seen the new one yet NO SPLOIERS
<KwakLad> Bye for now SB
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I think i saw somewhere that lauren had different ideas for Cadence
<Tovler> darn, I forgot to spam "grond"
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> there was even going to be a sea ponies episode i recall
<CCCP> can any one send me a link?
<Owfin> I loved the reveal and moral of The Last Roundup, just not the buildup
<Midnight_Fire> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wh73f-Y1wg
<CCCP> Midnight_Fire: YAY! :)
<CCCP> <3
<PartyPony> Hell yes

<Tovler> finally, the Spring part
<Owfin> Ah
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> His diamond sword had low durability
<Owfin> XD
<Apokalipse> Ooooh, this is the spring part... yeah I like it too
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Oh cool the babies are back
<Tovler> No Snow? but isn't Arizona near Colorado?
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I miss Tank...
<capitalist_brony> celestia is in this.
<Midnight_Fire> That's what you get for living just below the Arctic circle, Wrek
<Owfin> I live in the hot part
<Alarmed_Llama> Poison joke.
<Tovler> dat poison joke
<CK|Asleep> Oh, right. Wrek, we had an idea for a drawing for you to make last night (in case you hadn't already been asked): Twilight in a sari, preferably in a Bollywood dancing pose. :D
<Hydrazine> suddenly spring
<mario_pony> HOT!!!
<Conyst> Run from the blue flower
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Tank showed up for one episode...never mention EVER AGAIN
<tgl1992> Celestia :3
<Hydrazine> celestia hair :D
<CK|Asleep> A beautiful heart, faithful and strong
<mario_pony> princess?
<Midnight_Fire> Yes, Wrek, we discussed it last night and you must draw Bollywood Twilight
<Luna> 07,01Bollywood Twilight
<Owfin> In Arizona there is snow piled up 2 hours away from 80 degree weather. :D
*Luna 07,01gotta see this

<Owfin> And in the summer here it gets to 120 degrees
<KwakLad> Bolly-light*

<Vaponyeon> pony sari's... im okay with this
<mario_pony> KwakLad: good trying to pass god of war how about you?
<Conyst> then die
<Owfin> She looks evil
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Well for ponies
<Conyst> Definitely evil
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> This is clearly not a trap
<Tovler> and then CN drove Genndy away from them
<KwakLad> Not too bad, still suffering from a BronyState night time sucker punch :p
<Luna> 07,01wait and see :)

<The_Greener> You're going to love me!
<Golakka> Ey
<TOY_PON3> Hey do you think I should download the MW3 multiplayer even though I have MW3 for ps3?
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Jack used CUT
<CK|Asleep> Celestia confirmed for Poison Ivy
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> its super effective
<mario_pony> hi TOY_PON3!
<Tovler> That rose has too many thorns
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> She doesn't seem that angry
<Tovler> 49
<Golakka> is this MW3 or MW2 DLC, I cannot tell the difference
<Owfin> MOOD WHIPLASH
<TOY_PON3> MW3
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I wonder how old Granny Smith is
<TOY_PON3> I have it already but not sure if I wanna download it again for Steam
<Golakka> add 20 years to your oldest idea
<Tovler> hmm (crap, I can't talk about the new episode)
<Vaponyeon> well Ponyville is hundreds of years old
<Vaponyeon> Twilight said so
<groovy_scratch> over 9000
<unfoundbug> new song in ep was awesome
<Owfin> New SONGS
<Owfin> Three different songs
<Owfin> ooops
<Owfin> Sorry
<Owfin> *seals mouth*
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> the What Could Have Been information for MLP FIM is interesting
<unfoundbug> :O
<Alarmed_Llama> So this is Samauri Jack?
<unfoundbug> i only just got to the first one
<TOY_PON3> Okay um I seriously need to know if I should down load that game..
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> So who voices Pinkie pie?
<Tovler> yep. Genndy Tartakovsky for Season 4 please.
<Owfin> SORRY
<unfoundbug> right, ima be back after its finished
<Owfin> *hides*
<The_Greener> Owfin, did I not see on the chat about there being 4?
<Tovler> no more funny openings, just weird closeups
<desertman2> Why do you want to if you already have it?
<Conyst> who is the milkman
<TOY_PON3> True..
<Owfin> Oh, right
<Wrek> 05this
<Wrek> 05is
<Wrek> 05my favorite
<Wrek> 05episode
<Wrek> 05of all
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I am the Milkman,my milk is delicious
<TOY_PON3> dat Wrek
<Tovler> This is Hard boiled as hell.
<Alarmed_Llama> No spoilers please.
<mario_pony> i wish there were rain here
<Conyst> what is the milkman conspiracy
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Anyone know who Pinkie Pie's VA is?
<Wrek> 05seriously this is an epic episode
<Owfin> Andrea something
<Tovler> Lulu, sweet thing
<The_Greener> Silly Arceus-pony|Fancy.
<KwakLad> what is this show?
<DashWithRainbows> Andrea Libman I think Arceus-pony|Fancy
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Isnt that Fluttershy's Va?
<DashWithRainbows> Yes.
<TOY_PON3> Yea
<Tovler> But then Lulu became Luna. Things just weren't the same.
<DashWithRainbows> both are the same person.
<mario_pony> i always wear a red shirt with red hoodie and a red pair of shoes
<The_Greener> Shannon Chan-Kent for the singing voice.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> What i find amusing is Luna Eclipsed was going to have a Rarity segment
<Owfin> Applejack and Rainbow Dash are also voiced by the same person. Rarity's voice actress also voices Luna and Granny mith
<Owfin> Smith
<Tovler> The Rarity segment would have had a Pink Luna. strange that hasbro cut that.
<TOY_PON3> and Derpy
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> The voice actor for trixie did a good impression of Celestia
<Golakka> Cana nyone tell me where to signup for the newsletter?
<TOY_PON3> PM a mod
<Apokalipse> Talk to Luna
<Conyst> Dat emotion chip
<Tovler> the lulz, if you will
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> From what I've seen I think Laura did not intend for Candence to be a Alicorn
<TOY_PON3> She didn't
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Why she is a alicorn I will never know
<mario_pony> who is candence?
<Conyst> pew pew
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Stuff Blowing Up
<meh> i like the music
<The_Greener> Wait what? Derpy?
<Tovler> How are little girls gonna care about a wedding between 2 nobodies?
<mario_pony> Arceus-pony|Fancy: who is candence?
<Alarmed_Llama> We're robots. Robots with cars!
<Kazahana> Pink Luna? o.o
<TOY_PON3> Okay since only one pony answered my question I'm just gonna NOT download it and play it on PS3
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> A Alicorn in a Rairity episode
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Princess Cadence
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> my bad..

<Owfin> Heart shaped tongue
<TOY_PON3> ninja'd me
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> *toy
<TOY_PON3> Yes Arceus-pony|Fancy
<meh> he can breath?
<Alarmed_Llama> Is that supposed to be a trumpet!?
<meh> indeed
<alexxm> if he's a robot why does he wear clothes
<Alarmed_Llama> Trumpets only have 3 valves.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> The Princess Cadence toy looks like pink Celestia
<Tovler> 2 handed trumpet
<The_Greener> alexxm, fashion!
<meh> dat sudden cut
<Hydrazine> shit just got real

<Tovler> I miss Lulu. She was the best mod
*TOY_PON3 checks self and coat is white
<TOY_PON3> Nope..
<Conyst> Don't you just hate it when you get a samuria problem
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Celestia is finaly white:All is right with the world
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Aku is a total dick
<Alarmed_Llama> Translation, "I left you for acuz."
<meh> the hitman
<Tovler> (… is my house on fire?)
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Gah enough with the strobe light
<TOY_PON3> Arceus-pony|Fancy: You calling me white?
<Owfin> Well I can know he doesn't die because he is still narrating
<TOY_PON3> :|

<NullRadix> hrmph... i still need some aviator goggles
<Owfin> But if he's a robot...

<groovy_scratch> i want to be able to reload like that
<Hydrazine> this looks like that old XP screensaver
<Tovler> She took alcohol with Xanax.

<Arceus-pony|Fancy> He sure is noisy for trying to sneak around
<Ingwaz> my thoughts as well Arceus-pony|Fancy
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Well sure he is a robot, but still
<Owfin> What if those pipes had posionous gas?
<Tovler> never take alcohol with that stuff ever.
<Hydrazine> he's a robot
<Alarmed_Llama> Shoot everything that moves!
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Owfin he's a robot won't bother him
<Owfin> I know but it would bother Jack
<The_Greener> Intruders must die!
<LunarKing> shoot ALL the things
<Conyst> and everything that doesn't
<Thudnerpony> Jack is immune to poison
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Shoot everything that DOESN'T MOVE

<Wrek> 05but he wasnt a good guy per se
<Owfin> Rule of drama?
<Wrek> 05he killed alot untill he retired
<The_Greener> Guess robots don't count.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Jack could have helped the robot
<whatmagicisthis> hes a robot it had no soul
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Aku YOU BASTARD
<Tovler> Young Jack in A… Atlanta?
<Alarmed_Llama> What is a soul?
<groovy_scratch> the saddest thing is that it the series ended without ending
<LunarKing> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04KVVq3IySA&feature=related
<Owfin> That was good
<Owfin> The music is also great
<Wrek> 05Take care of Lulu.... sweet thihh...
<Owfin> I also had never seen this show before
<Tovler> I'll keep that in mind when Luna becomes Lulu again.
<Tovler> RIP, X9 and Whitney Houston
<Alarmed_Llama> Owfin: I'd never seen it, but I knew the very basic plotline.
<Owfin> Samurai Jack --> Princess Celestia
<Bronyfied> easy survey
<Owfin> It's so obvious
<mario_pony> terrorist
<Hydrazine> thats a nice beard
<Alarmed_Llama> IMA GIRAFFE!
<Tovler> Young Jack in super Africa
<Saturn> 08,01and now to watch the new pony episode, since i was a bumface and overslept
<OneTrickPony> first ep?
<Owfin> Dang, that last episode was goood.
<Saturn> 08,01wish me luck!
<Tarku> ikr Saturn same here
<MirrorImage> OneTrickPony - no, this isn't the first episode
<derpy_pony> this episode was epic
<MirrorImage> the first episode takes place during the first battle with Aku in the "present"
<Owfin> I woke up at 6. :)
<derpy_pony> have fun, Saturn
<OneTrickPony> I thought this was the pilot
<Conyst> good luck Saturn
<MirrorImage> i don't *think* this is it...
<Owfin> Little Kid: I am the world's only wha- CANDY
<Bronyfied> what is a soul? suberstitious or unexplainable?
<MirrorImage> Saturn - fair warning, you may need a new jaw after this episode from smiling so much
<unfoundbug> Saturn i did the same thing, i think this is the only time BMN has ever harboured ill will
<Conyst> Help us Jack your our only hope
<dashiee> CANT STOP SMILIN
<dashiee> NOTHING RIGHT NOW CAN MAKE ME FROWN
<unfoundbug> new episode is great
<Tovler> Can I pick a 6 episode miniseries for a B movie?
<Alarmed_Llama> Dashie: What about Fluttershy crying?
<Bronyfied> bloody ads
<Owfin> Pinkie Pie for all of the newest episode: "Let's put a SMILE on that face"
<OneTrickPony> we should watch the room for B movie
<MirrorImage> Alarmed_Llama - that won't make us frown, that will make us beat your face in
<unfoundbug> Owfin no spoilers
<Owfin> Sorrryu
<Owfin> :S
<Alarmed_Llama> Mirror: I never said I was going to make her do it.
<Owfin> I'm terrible with this
<MirrorImage> unfoundbug - in all fairness, this episode was a Rosebud episode ever since we got the synopsis
<Conyst> one of us one of us
<unfoundbug> true
<unfoundbug> however i never read the synopsis and there are probably others like me
<unfoundbug> also: not a mod so dont take what i say too literally
<Owfin> Plus apparently the song was released
<unfoundbug> again, didnt listen to
<Tovler> even 1940s Hollywood thinks this is too African
<Bronyfied> I dont get this part... how does a samurai student end up at a tribe like this?
<Wrek> 05pfft screw political correctness
<MirrorImage> Bronyfied- they're going to teach him in combat
<dashiee> but the everyone already watched the episode
<unfoundbug> dangerous words wrek
<Tarku> ikr Wrek
<Alarmed_Llama> Yes Wrek.
<Flutteryay21> his dad was killed and magic?
<Ragnalock> i havent seen the episode
<Conyst> Rosebud was his sled
<Bronyfied> but... by a tribe that are far away from the samurai tradition when looking on the location?
<Tovler> Jack's Dad was still alive
<Wrek> 05when jack was born his father summoned all great tribe leaders and devised a plan to train him for the battle agaisnt haku, we are now witnessing when he was training with the african trbe
<Owfin> I think that Achilles Kills Hector is like the Snape Kills Dumbledore of ancient literature
<Tovler> so, is this Ethiopia or Kenya?
<Bronyfied> snape killed dumbledore?
<Wrek> 05dunno
<Alarmed_Llama> Is this real life?
<Owfin> I wish
<Dr_Fumbles> yes
<MirrorImage> Is this just fantasy?
<Dr_Fumbles> lol

<Tovler> =_= This dub is killing me.
<Veewave> lol
<Headcrab2000> durr
*Luna 07,01hugs Tovler
<RaveBrony> :o
<Tovler> I'm still perplexed that I, a 90s kid, has never heard of this show.
<Marx> IMDB says the movie is coming out in 2014.
<RAWRity> so, today's ep was adorable to an extreme that I'm not entirely sure how to express.
<Tovler> I watched everything, Even Matlock and Rockford Files.
<Iwubponiez> it was dazzling :P
<Veewave> The narrator makes it that much better.
<Kazahana> DAZZLING! ;)
<NullRadix|Working> not really, working
<RAWRity> also, today's Derpy spotting was the most bizarre.
<NullRadix|Working> but occasionally
<Iwubponiez> ya dat derpy XD
<Iwubponiez> how did she ever get into there !
<CountDoofus> only Derpy knows
<Tovler> I might get killed if I don't smile and love the episode.
<CK|Gone> "Like Sean Connery!" wut
<NullRadix|Working> suppose I could... move some windows around maybe...
<Iwubponiez> i just dno what went wrong 6_9
<Veewave> "THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!"
<Tovler> Sean Connery was in a Michael bay movie ~White History Fact
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oh don't worry, i was just asking
<kidzrul434> sorry everypony
<Luna> 07,01Sean Connery is awesome
<Tovler> we don't like nobody. dat grammar
<NullRadix|Working> nah, if I keep messing with windows maybe I'll get frustrated enough to actually spend money upgrading my setup
<Saturn> 08,01episode... was AWESOME
<Saturn> 08,01i LOVED he smile song
<Saturn> 08,01it's SO AWESOMe
<CountDoofus> *wub face*
<Headcrab2000> A gun?
<Ingwaz> indeed it was Saturn
<CK|Gone> Sean Connery IS awesome, it's just such a random statement. XD
<Bronyfied> sean connery even awesome when used in parody
<Tovler> I want a Gun Shiro
<Saturn> 08,01did anyone notice how the smile song was based loosely on the tune Yankee Doodle?
<kidzrul434> I'm sad everypony
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you're planning on upgrading your pc?
<CountDoofus> But now we gotta wait 2 weeks for a new episode. A Fluttershy episode, no less! :'(
<Iwubponiez> kidzrul434 why ?
<NullRadix|Working> It's been in the back of my head for... a while
<Headcrab2000> Wat?
<alexxm> how come
<NullRadix|Working> I have issues with spending money
<kidzrul434> I missed the new episode of the MLP
<Bronyfied> +Saturn, I thought you knew that pinkie pie always break the 4th wall
<Saturn> 08,012 weeks?
<Iwubponiez> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfAINy8MQa4&hd=1
<Iwubponiez> :)
<Tovler> thankfully we'll have Avatar and Samurai Jack episodes to keep us company… o wait
<CountDoofus> yup, no episode on the 25th. dunno why
<RAWRity> kidzrul434: it's up on YT now. GO WATCH IT IT'S AMAZING IN WAYS THAT I DON'T HAVE WORDS TO EXPRESS
<Iwubponiez> saturn eeyup :(
<Marx> Yeah, I noticed that too.
<NullRadix|Working> I probably would have bought two new monitors wednesday if they hadn't sold out by the time I got home
<Headcrab2000> wat
<kidzrul434> ok thanks
<CountDoofus> btw, didn't Saturn say the episode was going to be streamed again later today?
<Tovler> Because of this episode, I want to know everything about everybrony ever
<NullRadix|Working> but I need a new video card that supports 3+ monitors... which probably means I should get a better mobo to support it... and that just kinda cascades into everything
<Saturn> 08,01CountDoofus: i did not
<Headcrab2000> How long is this
<CountDoofus> huh. never mind me then
<MirrorImage> don't you restream the episode after BMN anyways?
<Tovler> oriental riff
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i don't actually buy anything unless i really need it, also i don't have a full pc, most of the time i'm just in my laptop ._.
<Lasharus> The narration for this cartoon remains quality.
<Saturn> 08,01bmn is in an hour
<Saturn> 08,01oh, yeah, maybe
<Midnight_Fire> New episode will be after bmn
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not sure
<Globetrotter> What did I just return to? What on Earth is on the stream?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not usually awake then
<Saturn> 08,01let's go with "yes"
<MirrorImage> and if you want to watch the episode anyways, the 1080p is on youtube already http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfAINy8MQa4&hd=1
<desertman2> Samurai Pizza Cats
<NullRadix|Working> see, that's where I'm at. I would certainly *use* the extra monitor space, and sometimes I wish my computer was faster... but it's kinda hard to deny that a new setup would be a rather large money sink
<NullRadix|Working> regardless of the fact I most certainly could sink the money
<EspyLacopa> Hmmm. How different would FFX have been if the main playable characters had been Braska, Jecht, and Auron?
<Midnight_Fire> I think I vaguely remember this show existing, but I never watched it.
<Tovler> I don't even remembering this show existing
<Midnight_Fire> Or maybe I'm thinking of something else
<Midnight_Fire> I don't even know
<Tovler> too busy watching Rescue Rangers
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> if you are going to use it, and you do have the money, i don't really see the problem, as long as you make that inversion worth the money
<NullRadix|Working> ah... but how do you know it's worth the money? There are "sales" all the time, and it's not always easy to figure out which parts are poorly made or not
<Saturn> 08,01woah, lots of channel noise
<Saturn> 08,01i think this is my new favourite pinkie face: http://i.imgur.com/rBqna.jpg (don't worry, no spoilers)
<Saturn> 08,01
<NullRadix|Working> only some of them seem painfully obvious
<DashWithRainbows> Suddenly, SlurryMoon.
<SlurryMoon> 3Oh gosh, I hope that didn't flood the chat
<SlurryMoon> 3mIRC derped hard and wouldn't let me connect ><
<Saturn> 08,01it did, but we still love you
<Golakka> Hmm, Pinkie pie has moved up to RARITY TIER, with rarity
<DashWithRainbows> Only know that feel once SlurryMoon but don't worry much about it.
<SlurryMoon> 3:3 I wub you too
<Bronyfied> I dont get it
<NullRadix|Working> brick and mortar stores, in general, are overpriced. Newegg is nice but mail order... I like at least having this concept of "I go here to talk to someone"
<Tovler> Animal androids… don't let Jack run rampant here.
<Bronyfied> those animal droids makes derpy look like brain surgeon
<Tovler> OR… Dr. Robotnik's been busy winning.
<richfiles> Holy 80's song parody! Borderline!
<Corona> those girls sound stupid
<Tovler> poor 4th wall
<Corona> but.. derpy is a brain surgeon!
<PonyGirl_82> ???
<Corona> lol 3d beard
<Tovler> Man, this anime was dubbed fast.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i don't like mail order stuff, too mcuh trouble, yet it's true, sometimes it's cheaper than anystore
<Kuzuha> cant wait for the next episode...greetings from germany ^^
<groovy_scratch> greetings
<Bronyfied> how can this cartoon even be accepted into CN?
<Luna> 07,01@ Kuzuha you missed the ep.. but don't worry we will re-stream it after the movies

<Bronyfied> the only bollywood movie I ever liked were about some guy named Billu
<richfiles> I'mma miss it cuz I work 4-9 today.
<Bronyzilla> Nah, it all looks rubbish tonight. Good night everypony.

<discord373> luna coming at 11:30
<kidzrul434> I am bookmarking this place
<Meanwhile> Mission accomplished.
<Tovler> you skyud me
<LunarKing> i hate being sick -.-
<Kesk> there comes princes celestia
<PonyGirl_82> Otakon if it makes you feel better you're still 2 years younger than me
<alexxm> if not at least release dvds in the uk
<otakon> kidzrul434: you should, they show all kinds of stuff
<LunarKing> fail 1
<LunarKing> fail 2
<LunarKing> fail 3
<Bronyfied> I am wondering why lune only appeared in one episode during season 2
<Tovler> Ponygirl_82 was born in 82?
<PonyGirl_82> yep
<Sundaysmile> call me dotty and you die
<otakon> lol
<PonyGirl_82> hence the '82' in my name
<Ziltoidian> what
<Corona> squeeze cheeze
<otakon> Dot looks good as a blond
<Bronyfied> I want the cheese
<Tovler> The execs hate Luna. It was a struggle to even get Luna in that episosde
<otakon> lol
<otakon> I LOVE
<Hydrazine> derp
<otakon> THIS SHOW
<Kesk> musicals everywere
<Meanwhile> Chevrolet. Sure.
<AppleCrab> I like Luna.
<Kesk> i like sun
<LunarKing> well
<PonyGirl_82> Who could hate Luna, she is awesome
<Tovler> So forget about Luna. Look at the pretty Cadence woooo
<Sundaysmile> writers were of a better creed back then
<otakon> PonyGirl_82: holy crap your older than me!
<AppleCrab> I like trains
<PonyGirl_82> lol only by 2 years
<otakon> yes
<Bronyfied> Tovler But Luna had been through the fastest rehab ever seen, a good morale could be learned from it... like rehab is possible
<Meanwhile> I still want to know who Cadence even is.
<LunarKing> nightmare moon, luna, woona
<discord373> king fear
<Tovler> But Luna has boy colors. That's weird.
<otakon> Bronyfied: yh, she made a COMPLETE comback from being evil to good in a year
<LunarKing> DAFUQ???
<AppleCrab> "Boy colours"?
<discord373> STAB
<Meanwhile> Colours are genderless.
<Kesk> BOOM!
<Sundaysmile> lol
<Bronyfied> swag
<LunarKing> so youre saying a giant muscled dude weaing pink is a girl???
<PonyGirl_82> I still think Luna was 'cured' too quickly, she would have made a better 1st season villain the ponies had the deal with throughout the 1st season not in just 2 episodes with magic jewelry
<otakon> also
<otakon> is it safe
<Tovler> all them blacks and dark blues… look at the pretty Cadence. Isn't she faboo?
<discord373> mayo
<Bronyfied> discord should have comebacks as villain
<Meanwhile> Mayonaise, poison, same thing.

<MI9000> is anypony here in north amarica/
<otakon> DJ-P0N-3: Iron Giant
<lunaisbestpony> So, I need help with irc clients. I'm on osx and I need a client that a) has automatic scrollback markers and b) can strip all these color codes and stuff. I tried xchat azure, xchat aqua, colloquy and mango irc and none seem to do the trick or I'm just too stupid to figure it out.
<MI9000> ?
<Meanwhile> String_Shredder: pointing at the comment above.
<otakon> LunarKing: hopefully
<richfiles> Gotcha :tiaface:

<MasterBrony> i cant hear it....the audio is too low:'(
<LunarKing> what is rainbow dash made of
<Midnight_Fire> Not sure why Trixie gets more hate than Gilda. Gilda is far more deserving of it
*RAWRity beats emangamer into a coma.
<PinkieFTW> Pinkie Pie = Rarity = Twilight > FS > AJ > RD
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Gilda is a douche
<Hazard3> is the new episode A Friend Indeed?
<LunarKing> i mean she can actually going through a sonic rainboom
<Muffins> Trixie gets hate?
<LunarKing> dafu?
<Ingwaz> i dont think trixie does usually Midnight_Fire, gilda is unanimously a jerk
<LordDerpington> Yes, Hazard3.
<Ingwaz> trixie is pretty well liked by some groups
<MirrorImage> so about how long until lotto?
<Dken2021> trixie is that special kind of hate
<Hazard3> kewl!
<PinkieFTW> Gilda should die
<RAWRity> Muffins: yes. lots of it.
<Meanwhile> Yes Muffins Trixie does get hate. Because Trixie is a cumbag.
<sonicrainboomer259> gilda the whore wins
<Meanwhile> I mean Scumbag
<sonicrainboomer259> T__T
<RAWRity> MirrorImage: 15 mins
<Muffins> It's essentially EqD's mascot
<Hazard3> already love this episode
<Bronyzilla> Brohoof.
<Muffins> She is, rather
<Midnight_Fire> I hear a lot more complaining about Trixie though
<otakon> dat hop
<sonicrainboomer259> random=better
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol meanwhile, dat typo
<PinkieFTW> PINKIE PIE! BREAK THE 4TH WALL AND BRING ME TO YOUR WORLD!

<Saturn> 08,01Bronystat's mascot is Nicolas Cage
<fluttercry> 05,15Lol Meanwhile
<otakon> Meanwhile: good lord
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> http://derpy.me/hcr1y
<otakon> Saturn: DERPY! it's DERPY
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Im still confused how Twilight had no idea that Celestia's pet was a pheonix or is the pet neewly recent
<Meanwhile> She's that to, but I meant scumbad.
<richfiles> Trixie the firemare is best Trixie! :|
<derpy_pony> this is the episode where pinkie pie changed from stupid annoying pest to maybe not totally unbearable for me
<ValtheJean> 2,14 of course, even if it wasn't, I'd still agree <.< >.>
<MelaPonie> which one is Gilda again?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> After Twi
<MelaPonie> oh
<MelaPonie> wait
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: no, it's Nicolas Cage.
<sonicrainboomer259> spike already broke the fourth wall
<fluttercry> 05,15Bronystate mascot is Indian Stallone
<RAWRity> Saturn: does that mean we're all gonna go see the new Ghost Rider movie?
<Meanwhile> scumbad? what? fuck it I give up
<MelaPonie> that assfuck friend of dashie's
<otakon> Saturn: Derpy!
<Saturn> 08,01RAWRity: yes. yes, we are.
<sonicrainboomer259> that beotch
<RAWRity> Saturn: I hear it's a ton of fun. Stupid as all hell, but fun.
<Muffins> Pinkie is best engineer
<Midnight_Fire> TheGreatAndPowerfulT beat me to it
<richfiles> I'd say that Philomena has a LONG lifecycle... Twi may have NEVER seen Philomena at the end of a cycle
<RaveBrony> Pinkie is best inventor
<Meanwhile> The thing that bugs me most, is that despite the fact that Trixie is a complete and utter douchebag, people still like her. That is beyond stupid.
<Bronyzilla> Gilda yar newb.
<PinkySpice> o-o
<Saturn> 08,01we should make Nicolas Cage Honorary Admin of Bronystate
<otakon> oh god no
<otakon> no
<otakon> NO
<CountDoofus> saw the new Ghost Rider movie... and honestly, I almost fell asleep
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Meanwhile: AMEN BROTHER, SHOUT IT OU!
<Meanwhile> BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
<sonicrainboomer259> u DAAAAARREE mess with pinkie
<ValtheJean> 2,14 out* even
<sonicrainboomer259> XD
<Nicolas_Cage> ohai Saturn
<otakon> damn it so much LAG
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Im sure there are several more times Celestia is a troll
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...it seems discussing Trixie causes people to typo
<Meanwhile> T'is the day for typo's hm ValtheJean.
<Hazard3> XD
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: she's pretty, and funny in her stupidity
<otakon> Celestia is NOT a troll
<Ragnalock> luna: could you boost the volume up a bit?
<fluttercry> 05,15Meanwhile....best typo ever
<Hazard3> god damn Pinkie
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it is...it really is
<Hydrazine> poor pinkie
<Meanwhile> Saturn: she's pretty much a douchebag.
<derpy_pony> no one except gilda ever got guitar riffs
<otakon> true
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> She sure acts like one sometimes
<Bronyzilla> I like how they troll celestia at the end of this one, though.
<richfiles> Trixie is a Dbag... but she appears to be a self conceited LONELY pony... She needs to open up and accept friendship to change! :) :|
<RAWRity> Saturn: change tom's name to Nic Cage
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: stuck up bitches are funny to laugh at. they're ocmic relief. gilda, on the other hand, is just plain mean.
<String_Shredder> u jelly pinkie?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the only thing trixie "needs" is to die in a fire
<sonicrainboomer259> just call her a bitch! you did that to rarity!!!!
<RaveBrony> I want more Trixie, Luna, and Vinyl...
<Meanwhile> Thing is, if she changes, I'll like her for not being scum, but people who liked her for being scum will be annoyed because she isn't scum anymore.
<Ragnalock> Gilda is the best
<PinkieFTW> What's the best pony ever
<Midnight_Fire> Trixie needs a hug
<RaveBrony> Pinkie Rage!
<IshBestPony> :|
<otakon> Meanwhile: true
<fluttercry> 05,15What about Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon?
<Saturn> 08,01ValtheJean: in another episode!
<Ingwaz> d
<PinkieFTW> IN THE NAME OF CELESTIA!
<Ingwaz> d'awwww*
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Fuck Diamon Tiara and Silver Spoon
<Meanwhile> Diamond tiara and silver spoon can go play in traffic.
<unfoundbug> Diamon tiara is worst than trixie
<RaveBrony> thats alot of jealousy
<Saturn> 08,01fluttercry: they don't have as much humour value
<otakon> fluttercry: DT's father and SS aren't too bad
<unfoundbug> worse*
<PinkieFTW> THE FUHRUR OF EQUESTRIA
<LordDerpington> Tiara can rot. Spoon seems to have a kernel of goodness in her.
<CountDoofus> oh no, this is the part where Gilda makes Fluttershy cry. pasuing stream!
<unfoundbug> damnit
<Midnight_Fire> Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon should be forced to fight to the death. Then kill the winner
<otakon> lol
<Muffins> Run granny run!
<Bronyzilla> Don't Want!
<sonicrainboomer259> with stolen food
<CountDoofus> pausing* even
<PinkieFTW> xD
<otakon> my GOD so much HATE from bronies
<RAWRity> Seriously, I'm not a fan of trixie. I think she's concieted and egotistical. But that is nowhere NEAR enough to warrant the unadulterated spite aimed towards her.
<Saturn> 08,01Midnight_Fire: that's horrible, but it made me laugh
<PinkieFTW> I hate those bitches
<Dken2021> silver spoon can win from kindness
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I like Trixie
<Meanwhile> Thing is, DT and SS are both what, 6 years old? They have more potential to grow and become better people, and look how you all reacted.
<derpy_pony> she will give it back
<PinkieFTW> what ever happened to love and tolerence?
<Saturn> 08,01also, hey hey now, bronies shouldn't hate
<RaveBrony> Them returnable apples O_o....
<Rare> idk about Gilda. She hogs her (only?) friend jealously, generally acts out against society and is so insecure she can't even tolerate some party pranks. Maybe she got issues.
<Saturn> 08,01we all love Diamond Tiary, right?
<derpy_pony> too far
<Meanwhile> Trixie is a grown mare and a complete dirtbag, and you stick up for her.
<Ingwaz> RAWRity: shes just tsundere, thats all it is
<Saturn> 08,01even thoug hshe's a massive beeyatch.
<RaveBrony> Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu, noooo
<Luna> 07,01how dare she!
<otakon> Granny Smith: Braves the Everfree Forest AT NIGHT by HERSELF....is horrified of "rattlers"
<Dken2021> I still think silver spoon is just a lackie of tiara
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so much hate from everyone ._.
<SuperBrony64|Nap> 10,02>eats it
<sonicrainboomer259> O_O
<Rain> dimond isnt a beeyatch
<IshBestPony> Saturn You're joking, you're joking I can't believe mai eyes
<Muffins> Nobody makes fluttershy cry and gets away with it! :[
<SuperBrony64|Nap> 10,02>'She migh give it back!'
<RaveBrony> Hey SuperBrony64!
<Rain> silver spoon is
<derpy_pony> tomorrow we'll have chicken for lunch
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I know man, but THIS PART!
<Kencolt> THAT did it.
<SuperBrony64|Nap> 10,02Sounds legit :D
<RaveBrony> :(
<unfoundbug> Saturn that likes bananas?
<Bronyzilla> Kill this criminal! Idiotic bitch made poor Fluttershy cry! That's the most diabolical crime ever!
<otakon> GET ME MY SWORD
<Hodiku> fluttershy!!!! :'(
<RaveBrony> T.T
<Saturn> 08,01IshBestPony: we'll love and tolerate her, and hope she becomes less of a bitch
<sonicrainboomer259> derpy looks mad
<Meanwhile> Fluttershy can handle herself.
<RAWRity> Saturn: fuck diamond tiara. she DOES deserve the hate she gets. Trixie is stuck up, but DT is actively malicious to Apple Bloom.
<Saturn> 08,01it's the brony way!
<CountDoofus> is it over? no more crying Fluttershy?
<MasterBrony> DEATH TO THE GRIFFONS!!
<Bronyzilla> DUM DUM DUUUUUUM DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM!
<CK|Gone> SB64: She'll give it back in about 24 hours
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> FOR THE FLUTTERSHY
<otakon> WE ARE HAVING GRIFFIN WINGS FOR DINNER!
<CK|Gone> If u no wut i meen
<otakon> For the FLUTTERSHY!
<Saturn> 08,01RAWRity: but she always gets he come-uppance
<Muffins> I'm in the mood for some griffin cupcakes
<RaveBrony> Party! :$
<Meanwhile> Fluttershy will never get a back bone until you stop molly coddling her.
<MI9000> dont condem all griffions just gilda
<Hodiku> welcome back SB64!
<RAWRity> Saturn: and yet she never STOPS does she?
<IshBestPony> otakon lets eat the whole griffin
<otakon> Meanwhile: but
<RaveBrony> So rare.... pshh... theres a reason for that...
<Hazard3> good god
<Saturn> 08,01RAWRity: well, true
<otakon> BUT SHE MADE SHY CRY!
<Hazard3> this ep is awesome
<PinkySpice> ...
<otakon> and NONE are allowed to make Shy cry
<MI9000> ahh age
<otakon> NONE
<LordDerpington> Fluttershy death glare.
<Bronyzilla> All the Griffons were eaten for making Fluttershy cry.
<derpy_pony> MI9000...in mythology, griffons eat horses
<Meanwhile> otakon: And that's why Fluttershy needs to take a self defense class or something.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> lol
<sonicrainboomer259> a year ain't much
<RAWRity> and the Pinkie Pie opened up a line of restaurants called PFG - Ponyville Fried Griffon
<Hazard3> DUN dun DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!
<PinkySpice> oh god.... imagine if someone made fluttershy into a prankster...
<Bronyzilla> :3
<MI9000> oh yeah well dont condemmm all of them just gillda
<Bronyzilla> Gilda's gonna keel joo.
<Saturn> 08,01i'm gonna sing a song for yooouuuu
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Fluttershy would be the sweetest prankster
<RAWRity> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<String_Shredder> RAWRity: we dont have that. just those griffon steaks from new years
<RaveBrony> Troll Pinkie! :$
<Meanwhile> I'm all for sticking up for people who can't stick up for themselves, but it does more harm than good if all you do is wrap them in wool and bubblewrap.
<Hazard3> guess what!
<otakon> Meanwhile: she's getting that in the next ep....which we are NOT getting until friggin March 10th IIRC
<Dken2021> yep, no new episode next week
<Saturn> 08,01Arceus-pony|Fancy: fluttershy wouldn't be able to prank people
<Hazard3> BUBBLE BUT
<derpy_pony> yay gilda
<RAWRity> Tom: you have FAILED me
<richfiles> Gilda eats shit for breakfast! LOL :D :O
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> She could try

<derpy_pony> and the week after?
<RaveBrony> boom
<Bronyzilla> Gilda's gonna keel joo.
<otakon> you know how EVERYONE complains about the The Mane6 not really "sticking" to their element? Fluttershy ALWAYS sticks to her element
<MasterBrony> does anypony think we'll see Glinda again?
<MI9000> NO NEW EPISODE NEXT WEEK THIS IS THE WORSR. POSSIBLE. THING!
<sonicrainboomer259> me too
<unfoundbug> uh oh mod fight
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Personally I could care less if Gilda neever comes back
<Meanwhile> And the next day. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day...
<otakon> Fluffy Gilda is still not cute
*unfoundbug hides in bunker
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> She is so unlikeable
<RaveBrony> I agree, MI9000 T.T
*Meanwhile rings up your home number.
<RAWRity> otakon: eenope. Best Night Ever
<derpy_pony> gilda is too cool for ponies
<Meanwhile> And the next day
<Saturn> 08,01well, feel the sting of my... party poppers!
<Meanwhile> And the next day
*Saturn 08,01partpoppers ValtheJean
<otakon> RAWRity: okay, ONE time but she was frustrated is all
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> *calls Meanwhile on the phone*
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> And the next day
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ...I...I don't even want to know saturn
*Nittany_Discord 11,01explodes
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> And the next day
<Dken2021> every party needs a pooper, that's why we invited you, party pooper ~
<otakon> and I'm sure as hell not counting her discording either
<sonicrainboomer259> KAMEHAMEHAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
<derpy_pony> vermin in the cake
<PinkySpice> thoes candles don't work that well
*otakon sweeps up Nittany_Discord into a neat pile
<sonicrainboomer259> didn't work
<fluttercry> 05,15Nittany_Discord you exploded all over the cake!
<Saturn> 08,01ValtheJean: partypoppers? poppers you do at a party?
<Saturn> 08,01wait, that came out wrong...
<Bronyzilla> Squee
<ValtheJean> 2,14 -_-
<RAWRity> and then Gilda started a war on the dragons. many lives were lost.
<Saturn> 08,01especially considering my... alignment.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> *uses super glue to put Nittany back together
<otakon> Spike in the cake!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And it tastes better as a result.
<Bronyzilla>
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> The cake has been spiked
<richfiles> Chaotic good?
<otakon> rUDE MUCH?
<Meanwhile> Gilda's a jerk, no doubt. But have you ever tried to talk to a friend you haven't seen a while when they're surrounded constantly by people you don't know? It's a mess.
<fluttercry> 05,15dat...white space
<Saturn> 08,01i'd like to make it clear now that i've never done any kind of illegal drug
<otakon> stupid capslock
<RAWRity> YOu guys know what ValtheJean said when he was asked if trixie was best pony?
<derpy_pony> they teach little kids to associate e-guitars with evil
<Dken2021> that pin the tail line reminds me of "its twilight sparkle's ballon!"
<PinkySpice> o-o
<RAWRity> I DISAGREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Saturn> 08,01i've sometimes been very, very drunk, though
<sonicrainboomer259> wrong way,retard

<otakon> I think I'm gonna have a nap after this
<PinkySpice> lag
<LunarKing> dafu is going on over there?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 strange, I figured I'd say something more harsh like "Burn that psychotic bitch"
<Bronyzilla> Man down!?
<PinkySpice> too much lag..
<otakon> Griffin rage
<richfiles> I have never done an illegal drug... I'm not even sure how you could even have intercourse with an illegal drug... Consumed on the other hand... :D
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Man she is such a bitch
<RaveBrony> Oh cool, Amazon has more blindbags for $3!! :D
<Saturn> 08,01actually, i used to have an alcohol problem...
<Meanwhile> Trixie really just needs to be run over with a steamroller. Slowly and tail first.
<RaveBrony> Miiiiiiine!!!
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Dun dun dun!
<MasterBrony> so, odds of seeing Gilda again are what?:P
<Dken2021> amazon has blindbags?
<RAWRity> Saturn: but then you took a rehab to the life?
<Hodiku> :O

<Lasharus> That film is fantastic ValtheJean.
<Meanwhile> ValtheJean: Can't say I have.
<Lasharus> "Asshoooooole!"
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> How did she not break her neck?
<Hodiku> and by baseball bat, he means MLP
<MI9000> OH MY GOD NIDNIGHT FIRE!!!!!!!!
<RAWRity> Saturn: so what you're saying is, the cure for alcoholism is sports related violence?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh, that's a shame meanwhile. And /) Lasharus

<bluestrom_S> indian music is awesome
<PinkySpice> I know what I'm choosing for my movie next rolluete
<otakon> bluestrom_S: you won't be saying that after long
<richfiles> Otacon... That sounds so bad, how that was phrased. Doing anything in fluttershy is... nice... :(
<Jim> I have a weid feeling that there's gonna be many many songs in this film
<PinkySpice> kung fu hustle
<Luna> 07,01@ jim eeeeyup
<otakon> richfiles: huh?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> never saw space mutiny i think ._.
<Saturn> 08,01have any of you ever been to India?
<DKen2021> this is one long music video
<Meanwhile> We're 30 seconds in, get your dance number on,.
<otakon> Saturn: eenope
<Saturn> 08,01seriously, everyone dances. all the time. exactly like this.
<Kencolt> Apparently, random acts of musical numbers are an everyday thing in India.
<IshBestPony> Saturn says its terribad
<otakon> Meanwhile: you were here, they have NO idea
<String_Shredder> and then he was on a train
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sing along, everypony!
<PinkySpice> ...
<RAWRity> Saturn: I KNEW IT!
<otakon> Saturn: lol
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> What the crap is this?
<richfiles> Falls onto tracks! :O
<Ponybrine> i like trains.......
<Meanwhile> otakon: I know, but still.
<TheMonstaMuffin> awesome funky indian singing!
<otakon> Arceus-pony|Fancy: tis INDIA
<Bronyzilla> I can't speak random.
<derpy_pony> never been there...friend said everyone is poor and racist
<Pale_Horse> Pretty sure it's illegal to dance on the front of a moving train engine...
<RAWRity> Saturn: they have to find some way to tolerate the widespread, awful poverty.
<richfiles> And then he was train
<otakon> so many MONTAGES
<ekips> we recently analyzed what main things are in a bollywood movie
<Midnight_Fire> http://derpy.me/IjNB9
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wow 1.9/10
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I have never seen this movie
<bluestrom_S> what movie is this?
<Saturn> 08,01serious and kinda creepy question: are any of you interested in coming to India with me this Summer?
<DKen2021> I met an indian, not to be rude, but his fragrance was unsettling, but that was the spices
<otakon> he's a hustler
<Saturn> 08,01it is
<Meanwhile> Saturn: no.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> This guy is weird...
<Lasharus> I'll pass Saturn, I'm not much of a traveller.
<kidzrul434> literal video
<RAWRity> Saturn: I'd love to, but I have summer classes scheduled.
<TheMonstaMuffin> this film is sure funny xD
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Wouldn't it be great if the makers of Epic Movie make a big spoof of all the Bollywood Movies? :D
<otakon> Saturn: um I'll pass, I can't stand summer in the states, summer in India would kill me for sure
<Meanwhile> Is that a record low score for Bronystate B movies?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I here India is quite rainy this summer...
<otakon> SuperBrony64: no
<Bronyzilla> Indians Ftw.
<Luna> 07,01@ SB no
<Lasharus> SuperBrony64 - no, no it wouldn't.
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: no. that would be awful.
<Midnight_Fire> No, SB
<flutter_spin> oh no...
<richfiles> dem ladies reminded my of the Weird PMV with some weird reporterish girl and applejack
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: the HUMIDITY
*Meanwhile hits SuperBrony64 with a bus.
<TheMonstaMuffin> superbrony!
<DKen2021> No, that would be trixie bad
<ekips> SB yes
<PinkySpice> how do you pm?
<CountDoofus> I see Indians at my job every day. they're nice people, just their odors could use some improvement
<flutter_spin> What did I join into?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> do we need to know how to dance ?
<Kencolt> This is better than last night-- the stream is stable.
<String_Shredder> swag
<otakon> richfiles: you mean SuperBrony64 fav thing?
<Ponybrine> seems safe
<Saturn> 08,01DKen2021: interesting fact actually, most indian food contains Fenugreek, which is a spice; the smell of which is not broken down by the body and is secreted through the skin
<Lasharus> Epic Movie was a bloody atrocity, and is enough to drive me to swear. Loudly. So really, my dear SuperBrony64, don't even SUGGEST things like that.
<richfiles> THIS part
<Bronyzilla> Kencolt you jinxed it to lag.
<Saturn> 08,01that's why indians smell
<derpy_pony> I have business to do this year...no time for longer travel...even bronycon will cost much time
<CountDoofus> but as said, most of that is because of the spices they frequent

<Meanwhile> Luna: http://i.imgur.com/MESBm.jpg
<Saturn> 08,01see, i have this thing about indian men and women. i can't find indian women sexy, because they remind me too much of my mother, and i can't find indian men sexy because they remind me too much of my brother
<otakon> Luna: Indian Stallone
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Luna: yeh, i stopped on a derp face when subtitles were being fixed
<Kencolt> Not... exactly. It's really a hiest flick-- with musical numbers thrown in at apparently random intervals.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Oh yeah, I'll PM you the link to it.
<kidzrul434> I'm outta here let ne know when this is over
<otakon> Kencolt: eeyup, were you here last night?

<DKen2021> this goes on for too long
<otakon> kidzrul434: 3 hours
<Kencolt> I was the one who noted his eyes were derped.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Hope you have 3 hours to kill!
<flutter_spin> Yeah, 170min long this film is
<IshBestPony> Remember just because you're picking a b movie doesn't mean you have to pick a bad one

<Bronyzilla> 2 1/2 hours of ancing, 10 minutes of film, 20 minutes of credits.
<Ponybrine> good luck
<CK|Gone> Yeah, there is a plot. >_>
<otakon> Give me any kind of woman to be honest, black/white/asian/indian I'm not particualry picky they are ALL attractive in their own way
<Bronyzilla> dancing*
<Pale_Horse> <--- *puts on his determined face*
<CountDoofus> I see a lot of elderly indian women... think twice if you hook up with one with the intention to stay together forever ;)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I wonder if they had permission to film on that train...
<Saturn> 08,01Sheepy: all indians ride mopeds
<PinkySpice> i think its an hour of signing
<PinkySpice> non-stop
<Bronyzilla> 2 1/2 of singing.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> *pushes the guy off the building*
<Sheepy> but there not all chav's
<SaxyPretender> 0,14see, this movie made me realize
<PinkySpice> singing*
<Kencolt> It's kind of not really about anything-- it's pure, unadulterated escapism.
<Ponybrine> firggin catchy indian song
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Movie over
<SaxyPretender> 0,14we need a Bollywood-based MLP episode
<derpy_pony> I've seen a part of this movie yesterday...there are scenes where they don't dance
<Saturn> 08,01SuperBrony64: it's india, half the peeople on the train don't have permission to be there.
<Meanwhile> This movie is about aliens that integrate themselves into humanity with song.
<CK|Gone> wut
<flutter_spin> I gotta' go to work. You guys have fun, heh.
<Midnight_Fire> Yes, Saxy, yes we do
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Saturn: O U

<CK|Gone> There's a very clear plot to the film, what are you talking about? XD
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I am pretty sure India is nothing like this
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Inb4 dubstep remixes
<Saturn> 08,01it's like indian Fiddler on the Roof
<DKen2021> subtitles, chat, what to do?
<Saturn> 08,01SuperBrony64: but it's true!
<RAWRity> Quick prep for those who don't know much about Bollywood: They switch genre every 10 minutes. It can go from a drama to a comedy to a spy thriller to a musical in the span of the first act alone.
<Saturn> 08,01SuperBrony64: they all hang onto the roof
<Saturn> 08,01trufax.

<Kencolt> I STILL want to see Twilight in a sari.
<Saturn> 08,01Pale_Horse: i would watch, and then possibly tap, that.

<Ponybrine> So when do they open the 7-11
<Meanwhile> ekips: believe me, we will not have fun.
<RaveBrony> Aaaah, ive got to go for a while everypony!! Until then! T.T

<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: unfortunately not; my mum's from a place where they speak Telugu, but this is in Hindi
<RAWRity> Saturn: I'm normally very gesticular myself, so it kinda feels like I'm watching a movie filled with less pale versions of myself.

<Ingwaz> hey richfiles, do you have a deviant art account?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Isnt it like a gateway to peace or something, Saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01in the north, only married women wear it, as an auspicious symbol of good luck in marriage
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's not a head dot, it's a laser pointer from a sniper rifle.
<Stallion_of_War> That load screen
<Saturn> 08,01in the south, girls wear it too
*Meanwhile dusts Nittany_Discord.

<richfiles> I only have an alt acount with the hurricanepansyplz animated icon... They're... humping
<Pale_Horse> Huh. crappy window repair there...
<Saturn> 08,01so if you see an unmarried girl wearing one, you know she's from the south
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, it's meant to bring prosperity and status
<Midnight_Fire> didn't know that
<CountDoofus> what about those bracelets they wear (called bangals, I believe)?
<Bronyzilla> It's a KFC store.
<Saturn> 08,01gues don't generally wear them
<Midnight_Fire> interesting
<RAWRity> Saturn: is it considered in bad taste if you tell a woman you like their Butti?
<Saturn> 08,01*guys
<Starflash> Saturn thats weird.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And that you're brains are about to explosively leave your head.

<Ingwaz> richfiles: i'm guessing its you then, i saw the comic where filly twilight sneaks in and wears celestia's crown and armor, someone with the name richfiles had made a rather fun followup comment
<Starflash> How did I know you were gonna say Japan
<Stallion_of_War> Nittany - I see a lot of zombies wearing those in Left 4 Dead 2
<Midnight_Fire> the bracelet is called a Kadah, or something like that (I think I spelled it wrong)
<Kencolt> And THIS is where he gets set on a life of crime and random musical numbers.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Wow, I iz confused :#
<richfiles> Yeah. I do those with my main acount often.
<Saturn> 08,01Kencolt: you made me lulz

<Bronyzilla> Three types. Tea servers. People who get served. Bronies.
*Saturn 08,01hugs Nittany_Discord
<Starflash> why every indian is hitting the other
<CountDoofus> why does this part remind me of that song "The Man With the Red Face"?
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: I only get a hug? I though we were in love
*SuperBrony64 glomps Nittany_Discord
<StinkomanFan> So, you guys here about that study?

<Saturn> 08,01thsi si because i was eating toasted muffins with blue cheese earlier
*emangamer smacks SuperBrony64 hard on the flank "good bye my dear friend
<CK|Gone> Saturn: When my parents found out, they gave up on me. Think I'm gay. :P
<Saturn> 08,01it was the best
<Saturn> 08,01CK|Gone: are you?
<StinkomanFan> A study proved that men DO NOT always think about sex
<CK|Gone> Nope.
<emangamer> Meanwhile: *raises his eyebrow* you really think so eh?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03eenope.
<Saturn> 08,01CK|Gone: aw

<Saturn> 08,01CK|Gone: well, such is often the case with ponies
<Dken2021> they needed a study to prove that?
<Meanwhile> emangamer: Not really, but who knows really.
<Starflash> CK|Gone: tell them you arent?
<Bronyzilla> *If you were gay song*
<emangamer> Meanwhile: I do... *snickers*
<DWR_Drawing> Nittany_Discord I may hold you to that someday...
<Pyrexo> lol.
<Meanwhile> emangamer: you think you do.
<Kencolt> My family merely thinks I'm an oddball. THis is okay. I AM an oddball, and oddly proud of it.
<Pyrexo> Matlan.
<CK|Gone> Starflash: They're Republican, facts don't phase them. :p
<Pyrexo> Jajjan best pony
<Starflash> -_-
<Pyrexo> :)
<CountDoofus> my colleagues automaticly linked MLP with furries. they look at me weird now
<emangamer> Meanwhile: oh, I know it for a fact who peagsister16 is into *snickers s'more*
<Dken2021> why do they waste studies on the most common answers?
<Starflash> Yay my family. My family exists entirely out of oddballs and hippies
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't r63 me marrying someone unless you r63 the other person.

<Saturn> 08,01i used to be a furry

<Pyrexo> Elvis Punjabi.
<Dken2021> dat scootaplush
<Bronyzilla> I WANT THAT SCOOTALOO.
<CK|Gone> Also: Aw, it's sweet that you'd joke, Saturn. <3
<emangamer> :$
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03inb4 x to the y
<Kencolt> Oh, and I am a Republican-- and we're ALL about the facts. Deal.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*facehoof*
<Meanwhile> Your facts are wrong. Go figure.
<Midnight_Fire> My dad is hardcore Republican too. When I showed him my PMVs he seemed impressed, though he did ask if this is some sort of "gay thing"
<CK|Gone> Ken: That explains a lot actually. <3
<Sumica> 00,10Hussle, indaia edition.
<Saturn> 08,01i... dislike the furry fandom now
<CountDoofus> Saturn: what changed you?
<xles> Saturn: Why?
<Saturn> 08,01CountDoofus: well, i was a furry in the 90s, when it was a very very different place
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Forget what I said.
<Saturn> 08,01much like the brony fandom today
<Saturn> 08,01kinda awesome
<Saturn> 08,01then it became... what it is now
<Kencolt> There are furries and there are furries. It all depends.
<CountDoofus> but then it went rule 34 all over the place?
<Saturn> 08,01so much drama, so much porn...
<Saturn> 08,01y'know, frak that
<RAWRity> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwzvx04rAB1qhkchgo1_500.png
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The brony fandom may go that route if we're not careful.
<CountDoofus> god let's hope not
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: aye, and i hope it doesn't
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm afraid it will though :(
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03odds are, it probably will in a couple of years...
<Starflash> RAWRity: that last ones just cool
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03or months.
<Dken2021> It's sorta on that route in my opinion
<Saturn> 08,01so far, i've seen a m inor amount of brony drama, but mostly seems free of it
<CK|Gone> Drama? I don't think I wanna know, do I? XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like the fandom.
<Midnight_Fire> This is why I am sometimes vocal about my disdain for r34 and the like
<Dumorimasoddaa> Drama happens
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's better than the show.
<Midnight_Fire> I think I come off as self-rightious, but I just don't want the community to go that direction
<Dken2021> I like this fandom too, even though there are some minor things I don't like about it
<CountDoofus> I've found a site focusing on everything MLP rule 34-ed. One site I wouldn't mind being blocked by SOPA
<Meanwhile> People will go where they want, regardless of what you say.
<Starflash> Dken2021 like?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It needs to stay a force of good and not devolve into a crazy religion or a civil-warring fandom.
<Kencolt> It's the nature of teh show... we're not going there, much, we're going to be about the message. Love and Tolerance. THAT'S what makes us bronies.
<Dken2021> rather not discuss it
<Meanwhile> Look at that guy who wandered into a mineshaft that was on fire.
<Starflash> ok~
<Meanwhile> People told him no but did he listen
<Rare> Saturn: I don't know, I was in the fandom back in the nineties, too. It is hard to see objectively, but looking back I tend to think people were less nice than I gave them credit for at the time
<String_Shredder> dat face
<Bronyzilla> Anyone know of a good fanfic? I feel like reading one.
<Meanwhile> Ofc not. and he was incinerated.
<RAWRity> Bronyzilla: I got one for ya
<CountDoofus> Bronyzilla: I recommend "Beating the Heat"
<Bronyzilla> Alright.
<Saturn> 08,01Rare: hmm, maybe yeah. certainly not like the brony fandom, i think
<Starflash> I find this movie slightly weird.
<Meanwhile> Only slightly?
<Starflash> only slightly.
<LordCelestia> 0,5BronyZilla I know one
<LordCelestia> 0,5:P
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03slightl?
*CriticKitten has never been a part of a fandom. :P
<Sheepy> Actseption: Act while you act
<richfiles> Gotta go to work. Bye guys!
<Dumorimasoddaa> Furry has always had pricks it took the Internet victimisation diffrent than brony has
<CountDoofus> later richfiles
<Starflash> okay this is just weird
<Bronyzilla> Okay...
<Dken2021> well gonna go, enjoy the bollywood, I'm sure Matthew Patel will like you for it
<Dumorimasoddaa> Plus brony isn't as heavly slammed as furry was/is
<Meanwhile> Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin, nal ok zin los vahriin~
<String_Shredder> fun fact: that wasnt a sitar. it was something else
<Starflash> that was alien
<Saturn> 08,01wah dein vokul mahfaeraak ahst vaal
<xles> Dumorimasoddaa: If we don't stop with all the r34 we might be.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I don't want to say it was an alien...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03But it was an alien.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Bah
<Starflash> Scoot-Scootaloo I knew it!!
<Dumorimasoddaa> R34 is a fact of life
<Sheepy> dat sound
<Dumorimasoddaa> Pony has little more than other fandoms
<Starflash> Ancient alien dude is now a brony
<Bronyzilla> :3
<Dumorimasoddaa> Its how it's treated, in brony it is, but it's by no way integral.
<Meanwhile> Arhk fin norok pal graan, fod nust hon zindro zaan~
<Rare> Saturn: I guess Ponies don't attract exactly the same crowd as the early furry fandom did. Furry never aspired to uphold values like love and tolerate, not even on a symbolic level
<Pyrexo> Babli is best pony.
<xles> Dumorimasoddaa: Well considering the majority of the furry fandom doesn't subscribe to it, I'm going to have to say that actual ratio of r34 to non-r34 fanart is completely irrelevant. If people want to paint it as a sex crazed kink of a fandom, they will.
<Pyrexo> Jajjan is nothing.
<String_Shredder> bubbly
<Roxsnow> TmG : 3
<Saturn> 08,01Rare: aye, that's definitely true

<RainbowcrashNBurn> struts himself? swag
<Pyrexo> BUBALAY!
<Midnight_Fire> music time
<SaxyPretender> 0,14SONG TIME
<Dumorimasoddaa> Xles true, but seeing our major sites don't really have much if any home for r34 it's less likely to happen
<Saturn> 08,01i like suggestive art, but not hardcore pony porn
<RAWRity> ...dat outfit...
<Pale_Horse> woo! Dance time!
<Saturn> 08,01because suggestive can be cute
<owlicious> why was the movie interrupted by a music video?
<Saturn> 08,01owlicious: bollywood, that's why
<SaxyPretender> 0,14because Bollywood
<RAWRity> owlicious: because Music numbers are the best part of the film.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, this song is so catchy
<Kencolt> I mean, these fall out of NOWHERE... but I guess that's Bollywood bascially, right Saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01Kencolt: aye
<Pyrexo> lOL
<Jim> You don't understand, the music video is interrupted by a movie in between
<owlicious> oh
<Saturn> 08,01bollywood is full of Big Lipped Aligator Moments
<fluttercry> 05,15india has right hand wheel?
<xles> Dumorimasoddaa: Pony fandom is in its infancy, we better be careful how we get percieved by the masses early on. First impressions last. ...Just ask the furry fandom. ;)
<owlicious> that isn't my husband
<Saturn> 08,01fluttercry: yup
<IshBestPony> yay, somepony thinks I'm awesome
<fluttercry> 05,15well...that would make sense
<Rare> Pinkie would definitely approve of the amount of random songs out of nowhere in this movie
<Meanwhile> Is it you?
<Pyrexo> Niiice :D
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Wow, women seem to be mistreated in India...
<Midnight_Fire> Fun fact: The singing is dubbed. Almost no Bollywood actors sing their own songs
<Jim> Don't blink, blink and you're dead
<Saturn> 08,01they were a british colony, so they have their wheel on the *correct* side :P
<Pyrexo> :( Way to ruin it Midnight_Fire
<Saturn> 08,01Jim: /)
<Meanwhile> It is the correct side. deal w/ it
<Midnight_Fire> sorry
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Left sided cars FTW!
<Jim> (\
<IshBestPony> damn thish lag
<Pyrexo> YAY PEDO BEAR APROVAL
<ButtercupSaiyan> There will always be people crying out that a certain contigency will ruin everything
<Dumorimasoddaa> The brony fandom has the first impression of awesome. I mean people who dislike the idea of it will pick at ANY thing to make us seem deprived and don't even need evidence
<ButtercupSaiyan> Once upon a time, it was radio and movies that were rotting people's brains.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Boop.
<RAWRity> I wonder if the huge amount of random dancing in bollywood movies has inspired internet memes about dancing akin to what we do with planking.
<Rare> Another thing I noticed about furries was that the fandom at one point became paranoid about public opinion to the point that people got shitstormed for linking furry sites on other websites
<ButtercupSaiyan> And before that, they tried to control books and printing strictly.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sorry, that was on my end with my Cat sitting on my keyboard.
<xles> Rare: I once got banned from a channel because I wouldn't join in in the furry hate. =D
<Pyrexo> Sly bastards ;D
<Saturn> 08,01RAWRity: yes; see The Guild
<ButtercupSaiyan> I think the people who protest over moral degeneracy usually have worst tastes than even the most honest, open people I know.
<Pyrexo> The Guild, as in Felicia Day?
<Saturn> 08,01which we should also stream at some point
<Saturn> 08,01Pyrexo: eeyup
<CountDoofus> I'm glad I never joined in on that planking, owling, batmanning lollapalooza
<Dumorimasoddaa> Furry just got weird, it couldn't ignor the chans and got so defensive.
<Rare> xles: Wow, that's harsh
<Pyrexo> Glad I'm not the only one who watches that ;D
<CriticKitten> PADAKE~
<Sumica> 00,10This movie needs more indian stalone

<Kencolt> Ultimayte scammers.
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/MESBm.jpg
<Pyrexo> Would love to see it streamed some time.
<Dumorimasoddaa> I doubt that level of defensiveness helped.
<Saturn> 08,01i have no idea what's goign on in this film...
<Pyrexo> All season 1 is an hour
<Bronyzilla> Well, isn't this quite an action packed film.
<Midnight_Fire> http://derpy.me/6ajDW
<xles> Rare: Yeah, they were bashing furries, I stepped in and said that "Furries aren't That bad..." "NOT THAT BAD?!" ...and that was the end of that. Fun fact, that ban is still active. =)
<Pyrexo> Dat beard.
<Rare> Saturn: I lost track a long time ago, too
<Midnight_Fire> http://derpy.me/UJ63P
<xles> Rare: And that was in like 2000 or something like that.
<Hydrazine> o.0
<Jim> Those eyes :D
<Meanwhile> He slides with a swagger you know.
<CountDoofus> I did like how the Draenei dance in World of Warcraft was based of an Indian performer
<Starflash> IshBestPony of course you're awesome :O
<SaxyPretender> 0,14He's Bunty.
<CountDoofus> on* an
<Saturn> 08,01it's funny that there are otakus who love Japanese culture, but there isn't really an equiveleant for indian culture, which is... almost as weird
<Saturn> 08,01and, i'd argue, far more rich
<Rare> Saturn: It's probably just because it is so much less known
<Kencolt> Saturn-- There's a lot of translated Japanese stuff, not so much Indian, so...
*Roxsnow is humming this song for some reason >w>
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's catchy
<Meanwhile> It is.
<Meanwhile> But then so is fly.
<Meanwhile> Flu*
<Meanwhile> Close enough.
*Meanwhile shrugpony.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I think they're running away from their parents to escape an arranged marriage.
<Dumorimasoddaa> I dislike Hindi culture but I like Japanese.
<Rare> xles: That is kind of over the top. I guess they just let the bans pile up forever there then.
<RAWRity> Saturn: it's because there's yet to be a big BOOM for indian culture in the states as there was for Anime/manga in the early 2000s
<Kencolt> And also, Anime has less random acts of musical numbers.
<Starflash> Saturn It's very simple, Indian culture hasnt hit in America, because of the difference in culture
<Sumica> 00,10http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/134011
*String_Shredder dislikes no culture
<Dumorimasoddaa> Well I don't dislike but I don't like in the same way as Hindi
<CountDoofus> Geth pony? me gusta
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Actually, she's running away to escape an arranged marriage, and he's looking to get rich, iirc
<Saturn> 08,01Starflash: ah, right, yeah
<Saturn> 08,01that's very true
<Meanwhile> Merely a Mare. Was I reading that or not.
<Saturn> 08,01because it's way more different than japanese culture, to western culture
<Starflash> because japan is nowadays, pretty western oO
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sorry, I don't listen to rap music...
<xles> Rare: No, I was in there for quite a few years, they tend to remove bans fairly regularly. Or at least they used to, haven't been in there for 10 years for obvious reasons.
<Saturn> 08,01Scoot-Scootaloo: rap music is hilarious
<Midnight_Fire> Sumica :D
<Starflash> Scoot-Scootaloo, thats good for yer health.

<Kammerjunk> Communism is best.
<Bronyzilla> That purring sound can get annoying. *Bad dam dam Puuuuuuur! Dad dam dam Puuuuuuuuuuuuur!*
<Indian_Stallone> Scoot-Scootaloo: to quote the Internation Noise Conspiracy: Capitalism stole my virginity
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: :D
<Saturn> 08,01Communism is great in theory
<CCCP> ^]
<Bronyzilla> Well it stole my pizza.
<Saturn> 08,01rather, Socialism/Marxism
<Kencolt> But fails in practice, Saturn.
<Saturn> 08,01which is left wing
<IshBestPony> yes but it sounds like they're refering to the Christian God, who is named God
<Starflash> They probably actually called some big god and it got translated to "God"
<Aircrafter> I love the system of Pokemon Day cares and naming pokemon: If you want your virginity back, that'll be 200 dollars.
<Saturn> 08,01Communism/Stalinism is right wing
<CCCP> Marxism FTW!!!!!
<Rare> The failure of communism ironically does show that revolutions cannot change the way humans work
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Oh Communism, you are so good in theory...
<Starflash> to make it more understandable or something
<Indian_Stallone> awww, they're falling in love.

<Pyrexo> O.O
<Starflash> Clap clap!
<Saturn> 08,01Onanism
*Roxsnow is clapping : 3
<CriticKitten> Definitely! Though it makes me miss "So You Think You Can Dance". They always had a Bollywood routine or two and I loved 'em
<Midnight_Fire> This is what Bollywood is all about
<Kencolt> I just found myself actually lapping mu hands. I'm so ashamed.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Antidisestablishmentarianism
<CountDoofus> one thing the Indians have much of, it's choreography
<Indian_Stallone> as I understand it, from an economic standpoint, the furthest "Right" is a market economy, in which business practices are dicided by whatever makes the most profit, with no governmental oversight.
<Saturn> 08,01heh, whenever asked my religion on official forms, i write "onanist"
<CCCP> Communism > all fors of government.... PERIOD!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03inb4 someone makes a RainbowDash bellydancer outfit.
<Luna> 07,01do eet
<SaxyPretender> 0,14We need Twi in a sari first
<Sumica> 00,10nonono, Twi first
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: This.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Suddenly WHITE
<Saturn> 08,01CCCP: well, i'd agree with you there if you said socialism
<Kammerjunk> Denmark is a very socialistic nation, actually.
<Luna> 07,01Mmm Luna in a Sari <3
<CriticKitten> Agreed. :D
<Sumica> 00,10also ok with that luna
<DWR_Drawing> I check chat and I see Rainbow Dash in belly dancer outfit...
<Saturn> 08,01Luna: you in a sari would be tres hot
<SaxyPretender> 0,14We need a Bollywood pony ep
<CriticKitten> Luna in a sari sounds nummy.
<Indian_Stallone> on the other end, "Left" is the command economy, where the government makes all decisions concerning how businesses are run and how the market conducts itself.
<Kammerjunk> I don't even know if 'socialistic' is a word, but it is now.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Why can't I hold all these Want?
<IshBestPony> how much longer is this film?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We're going left.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Is it bad that I like this movie but not understand the story that's going on?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But not towards socialism.
<Kencolt> THIS is the scene where I suggested Twilight in a sari last night.
<CCCP> Saturn: well i agreed that socailam is actually pretty good but i agree slightly more with communism
<fluttercry> 05,15Same here SB
<Rare> It's scary what communism did to the Eastern Europe countries. There are areas where you can't leave anything out of sight unless you literally chain it down.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03MFW I haven't seen the new epsiode yet :V

<SaxyPretender> 0,14We also need Spike in Bunty's outfit
<Aircrafter> I keep hearing "Punch A Bunny"
<Indian_Stallone> SuperBrony64: here's the plot: The guy and girl are con-artists trying to make enough money to make it to bombay, and are kinda sorta falling in love as they go.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I heard it had a certain song...
<CCCP> it does

<CCCP> Nittany_Discord: yes!
<Wrek> 05your home, your wife, your kids, your dog, your bike
<CriticKitten> It was probably the best routine in the movie. And one of the better Bollywood routines I've seen.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm ready to dart out of America because it's going towards strong Corporatism.
<Wrek> 05the 0.1% is victorious!
<Saturn> 08,01CCCP: my favourite form is Libertarian Socialism
<CriticKitten> Wrek: So you need to hide ya kids, hide ya wife, and hide ya husbands 'cuz they stealin' e'rrybody out hurr?
<Wrek> 05mhmm
<Meanwhile> Hey Wrek what happened to you the other day. You left TF2 and someone said you were bleeding or something.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We don't have true Capitalsm.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If we did, Hollywood might be bankrupt.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Instead of fucking with our laws.
<CriticKitten> Might? They would be.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And the car companies would be bankrupt.
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: next time you're drawing, could you draw us trixie in a sari? with a whole bollywood dance team behind her?
<Hydrazine> and then they kissed
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lobbying has created Corporatism.
<CriticKitten> The auto industry would've died years ago, too. :p
<Saturn> 08,01Hydrazine: not in a bollywood film :P
<Meanwhile> Or draw Trixie being hit with a steam roller. That'd be cooler.
<Wrek> 05so much bellydancing requests >.>
<Sumica> 00,10here comes the best actor
<SaxyPretender> 0,14more like Twi in a sari
<Saturn> 08,01and that, ladies and gentlemen, was a bollywood kiss.
<CriticKitten> Saturn: Noooo! It's gotta be Twilight first. Or Luna.
<Hydrazine> hehe
<Rare> Nittany: But isn't Lobbying a necessary consequence of capitalism?
<Saturn> 08,01CriticKitten: but trixie!
<Indian_Stallone> The closest Bollywood movies get to sex scenes is 20 minute long hugs.
<fluttercry> 05,15make it Twi and not Trixie, and I'm interested
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dunno.
<Meanwhile> Saturn: but Trixie is worst pony!
<Hydrazine> that was a kiss :P
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...oh God, I'm imagining Twi doing a bollywood dance
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I see some good in it, but mostly bad.
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: but she's so very pretty!
<Kencolt> It seems in Bollywood, it's more risque to kiss than to be nearly naked.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hey Wrek, gonna throw this COMPLETELY NEW idea at you, how about we do a Rarity...but bellydancing. :3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14IT'S AMAZING
<Meanwhile> Saturn: but she isn't!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because it's bucking democracy.
<Indian_Stallone> SaxyPretender: AND IT. IS. GLORIOUS
<LordCelestia> 0,5xD
<Sumica> 00,10Must be cause you draw such nice bellys wrek.
<CriticKitten> Ken: It's a cultural thing
<owlicious> They also have 20 minute musicla numbers
<Kammerjunk> There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man and bring him to the ground.
<Hydrazine> the whole mane 6 belly dancing :P
<CriticKitten> Saxy: INORITE
<owlicious> i want to dip my toes in that well
<Indian_Stallone> SuperBrony64: I agree with this suggestion and support it whole heartedly.
<Kammerjunk> You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad and leave him when he's down.
<Roxsnow> SuperBrony64..... I have mixed feelings on that Idea >>....

<SaxyPretender> 0,14...for some reason, Meanwhile and RAWRity are reminding me of AJ and RD...
<Vinyl> Ship them now!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14no
<fluttercry> 05,15So two ions are talking, when suddenly one says I just lost an electron. The other replys, are you sure, to shich the first replys, I'm positive
<SaxyPretender> 0,14not in that way
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> damn this movie makes me feel tired really ._.
<Saigneur> TO THE MOON

<Saigneur> BEEEEE YETCH
<Kencolt> Incoming Musical Sign-- I can feel it...
<Vinyl> I meant that I want to ship them in a box saxy :3

<RainbowJack> poor luna
<Polydunami> Dohohoho
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol fluttercry.
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: impossible. Gondor was never established to have been on the moon in the Lord of the Rings novels.
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Perhaps you should reread it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aren't they neutral until one loses his electron?
<fluttercry> 05,15yeah I probably should have said atoms
<unfoundbug> yeah
<fluttercry> 05,15because the one that lost the electron is the ion
<Meanwhile> Because you obviously missed the chapter where Celestia descended and moved Gondor to the moon so Luna would be less lonely.
<unfoundbug> ions are descibed as non-neutral
<Polydunami> Dang superstitions :|
<SaxyPretender> 0,14she mad
<Meanwhile> And then chat broke.
<Meanwhile> Or did it.
<Kencolt> Which didn't really work because Luna was all. "Eeewww. Humans. She just had to make it worse."

<Saigneur> it's friddd..... no, it's saturday night !!!!
<Meanwhile> Refreeeesh.

<Polydunami> What IS this movie in the first place?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...that's hard to say, the banter between the two of you is what's giving me that impression

<DarkBlueNinja13> Kentcolt: Are you sure that wasn't Lyra and R Dash?
<RainbowJack> lol
<RainbowJack> for sure
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think it was Lyra and RD.
<Kencolt> Might have been Lyra- was a while since I saw the pic.
<RAWRity> DarkBlueNinja13 is correct. It was lyra and RD

<Kencolt> Oh, GODS-- you mean it's LOOPING?
<CountDoofus> anyways, going to bed. got to pick up a friend from a party in like 5 hours, and driving with sleep deprivation = not good

<InsomniaLawnchair> Uh oh

<InsomniaLawnchair> Bourbon?
<The_4th_Wall> hi
<Phase4> hello
<emangamer> Saturn: obviously the plot revolves around Twi in every episode
<PinkySpice> it just goes on and on and on~
<Meanwhile> My idea of plot is above legs and below chest Saturn.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> uhmm so as long is not plot related it is okay?
<Bronyzilla> This is the part where the nuke gets armed.
<RawketLawnchair> So I saw the new episode
<Phase4> ...why are we talking about plot?
<RawketLawnchair> It was pretty neat-o.
<owlicious> we're talking about not mentioning plot?
<emangamer> SuperBrony64: he just flipped me off :'(
<Bronyzilla> Yep, RawketLawnchair.
<Midnight_Fire> Plot. Twilight has a plot. This movie does not
<RawketLawnchair> And now we wait two weeks for a copy of Dragonshy. Wahoo.
<Meanwhile> emangamer: so did I.

<Meanwhile> RawketLawnchair: I was saddened by that episode.
<Phase4> stop them we must
<RawketLawnchair> I don't know. I doubt it'll be any good, because Fluttershy is a very bad background character.
<Midnight_Fire> The most famous actor in the world: http://ts4.mm.bing.net/images/thumbnail.aspx?q=1622548022935&id=7de04c5248c38f0d657b41c8d9816429

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Silly Bollywood, this isn't King Kong or Titanic.
<Midnight_Fire> Pretty average length for Bollywood

<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: that's how bollywood works.
<RAWRity> For them, movies are a day long event with an intermission and everything.

<kidzrul434> I like sugar
<Kammerjunk> ...SPOON
<Midnight_Fire> Or maybe it was about 2 hours
<Phase4> Saturn: aparently neither do i, google told me nothing
<Phase4> ohai SaxyPretender and SuperBrony64
