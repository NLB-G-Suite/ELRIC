<otakon> Also, Spirits WIthin is NOT a A movie
*LunaTheBeloved uhgs Deceptive_Cadence back
<SaxyPretender> 0,14nope, nada
<otakon> not in any sense but budget
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think he didn't want B.
<Phase4> 00,02suprising, thought there would be
<Ghosties> 04I think he was just messing around :P
<LunaTheBeloved> Oh and Moo SB64
<Randomnerd> I would watch a Derpy Movie.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Deceptive_Cadence> I changed my nick to this for various reasons
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Otakon, why so buttmad over Spirits within?
<Deceptive_Cadence> Mostly because of the pun
<Meanwhile> SaxyPretender SuperBrony64 Luna we respectably ask that you reconsider the A movie.
<Randomnerd> otakon: I will watch ANYTHING with Steve Buscemi.
<Sumica> 00,10we have 20 DoublePint who picked Tremmors
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sad to waste your fractional chance of winning on a joke, but good joke nonetheless.
<Ghosties> 04Tremmors?
<Freefall29> The B movie doesnt even have a plot summary on IMDB
<EspyLacopa> Tremors with Burt Gummer?
<otakon> yeah, but it's SPIRITS WITING
<Ghosties> 04Like that one movie with Kevin Bacon?
<Randomnerd> RX-78-SweetieBot: Oh, it's a terrible movie.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tremors?
<otakon> Freefall29: it's Tremors
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Phase4> 00,027.1/10
<Midnight_Fyre> I kinda agree that it doesn't seem like an A movie
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I ask that the A movie be kept
<Ghosties> 04Nice
<Freefall29> I thought it was hawk jones?
<Ghosties> 04Haha, Kevin Bacon
<Ghosties> 04Oh boy
<Phase4> 00,02Australia!
<fluttercry> 05,1588% on RT
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03AWWW YEAH~
<Meanwhile> No one could find it Freefall29
<otakon> no, they couldn't find that one
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Tremors?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14UYES
<SaxyPretender> 0,14YES
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I've seen it, its not terrible.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay.
<Sumica> 00,10sounds like a keeper to me
<otakon> so we get Clerks tonight
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moo ^-^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14FUCKING HELL YEAH
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm so okay with this
<Bronysith> hi SuperBrony64
<Wrek> 05seems A but hmm
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I'LL TAKE IT!
<Freefall29> ok. thanks for clearing that up. :)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's a B
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: no, please no it's boring and long
<Ghosties> 04Hey Bacon! You're gonna be in a movie next week!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> TREMORS
<EspyLacopa> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100814/ <-- it's got Burt Gummer!
<Meanwhile> So how come we aren't even showing the randomiser this time?
<Midnight_Fyre> Tremors! Hell yeah!
<otakon> however, B movie is good
<Phase4> 00,02"Tremors is basically a landlocked variation on 'Jaws'"
<SaxyPretender> 0,14CHILDHOOD MOVIE, HERE I COME
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I VOTE TITANIC 2 FOR MY A MOVIE
<Meanwhile> Seriously, we get paranoid about not sharing the result list so the answer is to hide everything?
<otakon> Meanwhile: no idea, that's why I'm calling shenanigans
<Phase4> 00,02dat movie
<SaxyPretender> 0,14TREMORS FOR B
<Wrek> 05SaxyPretender: ah so you have seen it and know? neat
<RX-78-SweetieBot> otakon: so is Legend of The Galactic Heroes.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Tremors is a great B movie vote.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14THANK GOD
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: what?
<Ghosties> 04How much budget did Tremors get?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I love that movie, seen it a lot
<RX-78-SweetieBot> doesnt Stop LoGH from being the best anime ever though
<Freefall29> this movie sounds interesting
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Reconsider the A Movie? Why?
<Sumica> 00,10133 Null, with Read It and Weep
<otakon> still, SPIRITS WITHIN PLEASE PICK SOMEHING ELSE!
<Wrek> 05$11,000,000 (estimated)
<otakon> SuperBrony64: bc that movie is crap
<RX-78-SweetieBot> SuperBrony64: they are buttmad
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Meh tier~
<Wrek> 05Gross:
<Wrek> 05$48,572,000 (Worldwide)
<Ghosties> 04Oh wow
<Randomnerd> Mmmm Beer.
<otakon> SuperBrony64: it's super long and boring
<Midnight_Fyre> I knew they'd never find a copy of Hawk Jones. It barely has any votes on IMDb, which means few people have seen it, which means there aren't many copies out there
<Meanwhile> Because it's not an A movie.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay Rainbow Dash ep.
<fluttercry> 05,15Tremors had a high budget. it may be A
<otakon> SuperBrony64: it's like 2.5 goddamn hours and UTTERLY BORING
<Midnight_Fyre> I agree. Not an A movie
<Ghosties> 04Well, we should decide here and now
<Bjornfot> :I
<Freefall29> hawk jones. if it doesnt even have a summary, someting is up
<EspyLacopa> Hmmm. I guess I'll have to change my pony episode pick since Read it and Weep has been picked.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's a B
<Randomnerd> I'm with ota on this one, SuperBrony64
<Phase4> 00,02there are a few people begging us to reconsider the A movie
<SaxyPretender> 0,14a well done B
<Phase4> 00,02i say we keep it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It's a high budget movie, therefore A quality.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I vote we keep the A movie just to see people rage next week.
<Wrek> 05i say we keep it too
<Randomnerd> I love Steve Buscemi, but...
<Ghosties> 04And a few people say a reroll is in order for A
<Wrek> 05its tagged along movies like eight legged freaks
<Wrek> 05so its awesome
<Wrek> 05but B
<Randomnerd> It might even hit WMC.
<Ghosties> 04But
<Wrek> 05awesome but B
<Ghosties> 04But
<Meanwhile> Did we decide that being shit wasn't enough to make it not an A movie?
<otakon> SuperBrony64: PLEASE NO! This is WMC material, IT BANKRUPTED THE STUDIO THAT MADE IT!
<Ghosties> 04Tremors was an excellent film
<Freefall29> @superbrony64: High budget doesnt automatically mean A movie
<Sumica> 00,1077 Whiteheart who picked a two partter of Friendship is magic part 1
<EspyLacopa> So, we got a poor A Movie, and a good B Movie. Sounds like Business as Usual here.
<Ghosties> 04MUCH better than all that other crap after it
<Ulthane> RX-78-SweetieBot problem is you wont see people rage, you'll see them sleeping
<SaxyPretender> 0,14still a B
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Keep the movie, it makes everyone mad. /trololol
<RAWRity> So what's going on with the lottery?
<fluttercry> 05,15it's a combo of budget and response from the public and critics
<otakon> SuperBrony64: PLEASE RECONSIDER!
<Ghosties> 04But the budget
<RAWRity> also hi
<Ghosties> 04I mean
<Ghosties> 04Really
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's a good B
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Ulthane: Im okay with that too.
<Ghosties> 04If we're doing budget...
<Bronysith> god i hate beaurcrats
<Wrek> 05the room had a high budget
<Sumica> 00,10So we rerolling A?
<otakon> fluttercry: horrible reviews, budget KILLED the studio that made it
<Midnight_Fyre> Exactly. Boring bad is not as fun as cheesy bad
<Randomnerd> EspyLacopa: I know. how Clerks is a B movie is lost on me. Production value?
<Freefall29> Bronysith: who doesn't.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03No, just keep it >_<
<EspyLacopa> We've had to put up with shit like Spider's Web and Babes in Toyland.
<Freefall29> congress has a 5% approval rating man
<Bronysith> Freefall29: other beaurcrats
<otakon> PLEASE NO!
<Ghosties> 04Well, Silver would probably say to reroll :P
<Ulthane> RX-78-SweetieBot then i better pack my pillow and blankie
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01KEEP THEM PLEASE.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But honestly, it has a high budget and as listed on our qualities for an 'A' Movie, it can be a movie with a high budget for the time. $127 Million is pretty high for 2001.
<Ghosties> 04High budget and all that jazz, hehe
<otakon> goddammit they're keeping it aren't they?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Waterworld had a huge budget, and it sucked iirc
<fluttercry> 05,15From what I see FF had a high budget and decent reviews
<Silverscreen> 1,11actually, I side with ghosties here.
<Sumica> 00,10tick tock.
<Randomnerd> otakon: They did :(
<fluttercry> 05,15decent as in passable
<otakon> fluttercry: no, it didn't have decent reviews
<RAWRity> I just got here, what film is being debated
<otakon> fluttercry: it was just a PRETTY PICTURE THAT'S IT!
<EspyLacopa> Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within
<Silverscreen> 1,11High budget, high gross, a good plot that's not a parody. The only thing that makes it a B movie is that it may have a cult following.
<Meanwhile> FF spirits within.
<Midnight_Fyre> fluttercry: So did King Arthur
<Ictiv> Frankly, I think they should mix them up
<Randomnerd> Don't tell me what to do, Derpy!! DX
<SuperBrony64> 11,02"A Movies are your typical high-budget Hollywood blockbusters; the âgoodâ films. Big names like Lord of the Rings or Inception, or highly acclaimed films like The Goonies or Serenity. We rely on critic reviews and the movieâs budget during a dispute, but movies good enough to qualify for the A Movie slot are generally obviously so."
<Sumica> 00,10and we have to restart the video =p
<Freefall29> RAWRity: i'm not so sure really
<otakon> RAWRity: FFF Spirits within
<Ictiv> Make FF B and Tremors A
<RX-78-SweetieBot> otakon: most people didnt like it because it wasnt related to any specific FF game.
<otakon> Ictiv: better, but just RE PICK A!
<Meanwhile> SuperBrony64: This one is not obviously so!
<Freefall29> which FF movie was the final adaption of FF7?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> so automatic butthurt.
<RAWRity> Final fantasy?
<Meanwhile> In fact it's obviously garbage!
<Wrek> 05ok so its A.
<RAWRity> OH FUCK NO
<SuperBrony64> 11,02"high-budget"
<Ghosties> 04Would you consider Kevin Bacon an A star or a B star?
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: well, that and teh boring characters, plot AND stupid concept
<Bronysith> advent children was good
<Wrek> 05switch places on A and B movies? :P
<otakon> Bronysith: it was fun
<Freefall29> advent children. that one
<Silverscreen> 1,11Never seen Kevin Bacon.
<Freefall29> should I see it?
<Ictiv> otakon: Believe me, I REALLY would love if they would take my A, but that's hardly going to happen. And if they repick A they'll repick B too
<Bjornfot__> gosh darnit
<otakon> RAWRity: PLEASE TELLT HEM
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Advent children is terrible just like FF7
<EspyLacopa> Seems ridiculous to start kicking out movies now because they're too shitty.
<fluttercry> 05,15We could just switch them
<Silverscreen> 1,11...
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: but I liked FF7
<Silverscreen> 1,11There's an idea.
<Ghosties> 04Didn't Spirits Within get a much higer budget though?
*Freefall29 shoots RX-78-SweetieBot
<Meanwhile> Oh god don't be lazy and switch them, please.
<Ghosties> 04*higher
<Phase4> 00,02127 Mil yeah
<Ghosties> 04wow
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, haha
<Ghosties> 04Much, much higher
<RAWRity> PLZ REROLL
<otakon> PLESE MODS JUST REROLL A!
<RAWRity> FOR MY SANITY
<otakon> PLEASE!
<Silverscreen> 1,11Yeah, but it got a piss poor critical and user rating.
<Randomnerd> So... donuts or moon pie?
<Wrek> 05well its apparently meh so jsut a thought :P
<Bronysith> otakon: it and ff6 and chrono trigger are all tied
<Midnight_Fyre> Agreed. Reroll please
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Only final fantasies I liked are 1, 6, 9, and 12.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Alright, let's consult with the Magic Conch.
<Bronysith> otakon: for my fav game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was computer-animated, so it sure did.
<Meanwhile> Just do us this small bit of justice and redo the A movie.
<Randomnerd> Which should I eat?
<EspyLacopa> I dare you though, to play the MLP Movie instead of FF:Spirits Within.
<Ghosties> 04But Silver, you said you didn't care for critical and user rating
<Phase4> 00,02i say we keep discussing it while the channel is muted :P
<EspyLacopa> For the lulz.
<Bronysith> RX-78-SweetieBot: at least \you didnt say 13
<SolairePony89> Randomnerd: Moon Pie
<Ghosties> 04That only budget mattered :)
<Wrek> 05animated movie... might aswell count out the biudget
<Freefall29> I know earthbound is not that popular. but i LOVE the franchise
<otakon> Randomnerd: moon pie to honor Luna and LunaTheBeloved
<Meanwhile> EspyLacopa: played that already.
<otakon> Freefall29: GREAT game series
<Wrek> 05CG*
<Randomnerd> Can't decide... Can't decide... BRAIN ANEURYSM!
<Wrek> 05w/e
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I say we discuss this in chat while the movie is going on.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Didnt even care to try FF13 since they went back to shit combat.
<LunaTheBeloved> Moon Pies are the best things
<EspyLacopa> And it was hilarious to be a part of the audience during that.
<Freefall29> otakon. you played all three of them?
<SolairePony89> Randomnerd: LUNA PIES!
<Sumica> 00,10lets put it this way, it bombed so bad square used the software to make porn movies to recoop the losses
<Ghosties> 04Well, you can discuss it in chat. I'm watching Clerks with the bros
<Randomnerd> Okay, that's three votes for moon pies.
<LunaTheBeloved> I ate one on my way back home actually....
<Bjornfot> What movies got chosen?
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, srsly?
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<SaxyPretender> 0,14eeyup
<SuperBrony64> 11,02$11 Million is a B Movie
<Phase4> 00,02lolwut
<otakon> Freefall29: eeyup, although I played fan translations for Mother 1 and 3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02$127 Million is an A Movie
<Wrek> 05we cant take it to chat. we gootaa roll stuff
<Midnight_Fyre> Wow, Sumica is full of interesting trivia
<otakon> Bjornfot: they are debating A, B is Tremors
<Freefall29> actully mother 1 was offically translated.
<EspyLacopa> Bjornfot: FF Spirits Within and Tremors.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Spirits Within punched Square in the financial balls
<otakon> Freefall29: yeah, but never released here
<RAWRity> The movie sucks, but it still qualifies as an A film.
<Freefall29> there was a retranslation that did a better job at it
*Randomnerd gives Moonpies to Luna and LunaTheBeloved
<Everlasting_Joy> What a conundrum this is causing.
<Meanwhile> Can't the fact that it sucks be used as a reason not to show it?
<Silverscreen> 1,11I say we switch them as the A and B films.
<otakon> RAWRity: automatic WMC due to it being broing as hell
<RAWRity> I mean, it cost more to make than most of use will accumulate thoughout our entire lives.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Final Fantasy was an awesome game series (especially 13), the movies have got to be just as good.
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: quantum conundrum
<Randomnerd> I'ma eat mah moonpie.
<Wrek> 05I agree
<SolairePony89> A Final... Fantasy... m.. NO, NOOOOOO!
<EspyLacopa> Feh. This is hardly going to be the first time the A Movie was bad, and the B Movie was awesome.
*LunaTheBeloved hugs Randomnerd and noms Moon pie
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Get on with it already, and choose the pony eps!
<Luna> 07,01*noms on them in a corner watching the discussion in mane chat*
<Meanwhile> They chose the pony eps.
<otakon> SuperBrony64: YOU TROLL! NO ONE COULD LIKE FINAL HALLWAY 13!
<Wrek> 05SuperBrony64: thast like sayign the doom movie was a perfect adaptation of the game
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, LOGIC
<RAWRity> SB best be joking about 13
<Freefall29> well I heard that a nintendo employee sold a prototype of mother 1 on ebay for 400 bucks. it was then dumped into a rom and put onto the internet
<Meanwhile> We're just trying to get this infernal movie out of the way.
<otakon> he MUST be
<otakon> horrible game
<Meanwhile> Mind you, SuperBrony64 has terrible taste anyway. So that's unsurprising.
<Sumica> 00,10wait so we are keeping both and you all are just argueing the tags? lolwut
<otakon> only good thing was it was "pretty"
<Bronysith> otakon: which gamE?
<Silverscreen> 1,11The high budget gets kicked aside when gross, critic rating and user rating all slam it back down to B movie status.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> really ? i only see fight about FF
<otakon> like Spirits within
<otakon> Bronysith: FF13
<Bronysith> otakon: ABOMINATION
<SolairePony89> Meanwhile: He has MW3, so I'm inclinded to agree with ya
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Movie-based games tend to be terrible.
<Freefall29> I heard FF13 was terrible
<Sumica> 00,10we can move on if that's the case
<otakon> it was
<Bronysith> Freefall29: i dont count it as final fantasy
<Wrek> 05seems like we are keepign both sumi
<otakon> it's really a bad game
<Silverscreen> 1,11Nitt: and vice-versa.
<SilIsh_Bob> so wait whats the A and B
<EspyLacopa> I can't wait now to see the reaction when my A Movie finally gets picked.

<RAWRity> Bjornfot: then your opinion is wrong.
<Meanwhile> Ah fml they're being lazy about it.

<Wrek> 05firstfags will die
<Spectrum_Rush> its like a rainbow
<Randomiser> What was second pony episode?
<Kandarihu> About SuperBrony64's joke about Final Fantasy 7 questioning the final-ness of the franchise: Square called it that because every game they made failed and they made a fantasy game as their final title before they'd go out of business. It was a success.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01First
<spitfirecolt> yeah look at the re series of movies those are bad
<Matt> Is that like moderators or something?
<oni_link> Matt: admins

<otakon> Deceptive_Cadence: what butthurt? it has as much to do with Final Fantasy as my left ass cheek also it's overly long AND boring to boot. It's just pretty...
<Silverscreen> 1,11Matt: Only mods use them to stand out from the rest of the chat.
<Tassadork> spirits within wasn't *thaat* bad...
<Freefall29> I actully tried this one game called drawn to life on the DS

<Matt> Okay then.
<RanYakumo> HERE WE GO
<CriticKitten> mfw Val trolled everyone (including his fellow mods) and picked a shit movie that they thought was good. Spirits Within is a *terrible* movie, you're thinking of Advent Children. I don't even think Spirits Within actually had anything to do with any Final Fantasy game, if I remember right.
<Bronysith> ogod

<DocSane> Yes, it's all in black and white.
<otakon> Shizuka: is there a Rifftrax for Spirits Within?
<K_A> inkBot: No, Clerks.
<Midnight_Fyre> Maybe we'll get lucky and they won't be able to find a copy of the FF movie
<Marx> Graywhoof, It's been raining at my place too.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Silverscreen: Discord directed it

<SuperBrony64> 11,02But I love Final Fantasy 13 ;~;
<Midnight_Fyre> :P
<IowaBrony> PaladinDrakkenwolf: All the time. :$
<Randomiser> Black and White movie so it must be awful
<Barbetos> Silverscreen Budget problems, that is why it is black and white

<otakon> SuperBrony64: it was a LONG GODDAMN HALLWAY WITH AUTOMATED FIGHTS
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> kitty :)
<SilIsh_Bob> TheGreatAndPowerfulT who is this Alan Turing guy
<RyunosukeKnT> Kandarihu: its not... that bad, its a sequal but it is indeed its own story (kinda)
<Randomnerd> Oh it cannot be that hard...
<AlienWarhead> Black and White cheaper maybe
<Freefall29> what do you see in FF13 @superbrony64?
<K_A> No, it's in grayscale. (Or a really light sepia? I'm kinda colorblind sometimes.)
<inkBot> but this wasn't the B movie supposed to be something else?
<RosePetal> Oh... okay.
<otakon> yeah, i want to know too
<DocSane> Who is driving car? Bear is driving car! How can that be?!!!
<Matt> Couldn't even afford color.
<SpeedyBolt> Shit.
<LordAuz> its a black commedy
<Matt> Jeez that is harsh.
<Wrek> 05inkBot: read on the forntpage

*Barbetos can't wait
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In Snowball Effect: The Story of 'Clerks' on the special edition DVD, Kevin Smith says that the film's original title was "Inconvenience". Then it was changed to "Rude Clerks" before being shortened to Clerks..
<Sumica> 00,10yes inkBot, but people like to pick imposabl to find movies
<AlienWarhead> Couldn't find the 1st B movie again
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Bronysith: Yeah
<K_A> Looks like a very unsaturated sepia.
*Bronysith strangles SuperBrony64
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> well, I'm gonna bleach my hair while I'm watching this
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If you promise not to clop anymore, we'll show the color version.
<inkBot> huh
<oni_link> K_A: i think its greyscale too
*Freefall29 stabs superbrony64
<SolairePony89> SuperBrony64: ...neither of which make a good game
<inkBot> ait
<Bronysith> thats for only playing for graphics
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> SilIsh_Bob read the wiki
<RosePetal> Lol Rude clerk.
<SpeedyBolt> I promise not to clop
<Midnight_Fyre> What is tonight's second pony ep?
<otakon> SuperBrony64: BAD GAMER! BAD!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Anyone wanna bet that Final Fantasy Movie is going to get replaced?
<TheXIIILightning> Nittany_Discord: No deal!
<inkBot> i like this movie. so not complaining
*Meanwhile slaps SuperBrony64 with a cinderblock.
<Ghosties> 04To show the color version we'd have to show Clerks 2
<SpeedyBolt> Even though I dont anyways
<SpeedyBolt> :p
<Silverscreen> 1,11Nittany_Discord: NEVER!
<Videofreak1127[M]> 7.9 on IMDb
<turtlegod98> just drank a whole bottle of cider LIKE A BOSS!
<owlicious> lol
<Darkness_Pony> ok
<Everlasting_Joy> Midnight_Fyre: Putting your hoof down.
<Randomnerd> Oh, God. This life... This was my life for so so long.
<Bronysith> SuperBrony64: i dont think the graphics and music sell the game. THE GAME sells the game
<Videofreak1127[M]> 1994
<RosePetal> Final Fantasy?!
<K_A> Wrek: The torrents and newsgroups failed us?
<Freefall29> quick. burn the witch!
<Darkness_Pony> I Promise
<SilIsh_Bob> TheGreatAndPowerfulT can't, watching Clerks

<LEROOOYY-JENKINZ> umm
<TheXIIILightning> Coome at me Bro!
<Videofreak1127[M]> RosePetal: That got a 6.4 on IMDb
*otakon pats SuperBrony64 on the head "It's okay man, but graphics/sound aren't the only things that matter!"
<Midnight_Fyre> Everlasting_Joy: thanks
<TheXIIILightning> Nopony fucks with Dende!
<LEROOOYY-JENKINZ> is this the show?
<RosePetal> Oh.
<Ghosties> 04Alternatively I just like the movie because it's just one big episode of Seinfeld
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The film's shoestring budget is part of the reason it was shot in black and white. A number of different types of lighting were used, and this would have required a lot of post production to resolve issues related to the varying color temperatures. With black and white, this isn't a problem.
<Randomnerd> Putting Your Hoof down was the ep I chose, so I'll count it as a win :D
<Videofreak1127[M]> RosePetal: not looking forward to that
<DeadpoolDash> the best part of Spirits within was the Thriller music video
<Freefall29> video games... hmmmm. what exactly where those things about again.... hmmmm
<RosePetal> Wow.
<owlicious> uh...
<oni_link> Ghosties: not sure if serious or poking fun at hipsters >.>
<Ghosties> 04Or I like the movie because it's practically me and my best friend working a job together
<Meanwhile> I chose Friendship is Magic part 2.
<otakon> Silverscreen: another reason I love this movie
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Final Fantasy 13 > Final Fantasy 7
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wait this whole thing is in black and white?

<Ghosties> 04Poking fun at hipsters :P
<IowaBrony> I saw this movie before it was shown on Bronystate. *puts on hipster glasses*
<Meanwhile> Ok SB I hate FF in general but even I recognise that's trolling.
<Freefall29> thats just trolling
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wat
<SilIsh_Bob> TheGreatAndPowerfulT but hes 100 years old
<Bronysith> I LOVE THIS PART

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: According to Kevin Smith in an interview in the book "My First Movie", part of the movie's financing came from an insurance settlement.

<LEROOOYY-JENKINZ> I BAKED YOU A PIE YAY WHAT FLAVOR PINKIE PIE FLAVOR *pinkie jumps out of pie in slow mo*
<Bronysith> id rather listen to this day aria than see blood in my urine
<pwny> Seriously, who would tolerate Gilda if she had a damn good explanation?
<DocSane> They start out looking all cute, and then Twilight would realize that they all look like clones of ponies they already know.
<tigher1001> PEACE
<Firelight> Hell fire!
<Somebronyyays> when i die i wanna go to Equestria
<JESmith> Like the Mane 6 go out to sea, but then they're attacked by a group of Sea Ponies who either kidnap Applebloom or steal something of great importance, so in order to get it back the Mane 6 go to Zecora who turns them into Sea Ponies themselves
<HyperMetalLugia> not even safe mode?
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dpvq6VVEzto
<Sumica> 00,10Just so long as you share the wubs with every one that streams and our hard working tecies too.

<Bronysith> id rather see blood in my urine than the star wars prequels
<TOY_PON3> MahBoi777: What I'm siri
<DocSane> Aloowed, even!
<TOY_PON3> :(
<pwny> The way I see it: Gilda wants to hang out with Dash. Pinkie is clingie as fuck. Gilda has some jealousy issues, which Pinkie exacerbates. Because the Mane 6 have the plot/writers on their side, Gilda is automagically the bad guy.
<Randomnerd> ... okay I agree with you there.
