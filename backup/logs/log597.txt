<Zum> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: After Scott defeats Roxy, the fourth evil ex, he can be briefly seen wearing a shirt with the Fantastic Four logo on it in the next scene at band practice. It is the only time in the movie he wears a number other than "zero." The shirt also has a very small '1/2' written into the logo, making him 4.5, which director Edgar Wright stated on the DVD commentary was
<fluttercry> 05,15Best song in the film coming up.

<ShadowStep> 8 bit music epicness..

<Vordox> ArcherJoe11: Lucas died. :P
<Zum> 01,11The fast timing wouldn't be bad, but they choke all the information into quick snippits that are almost literally blink-and-you'll-miss-it.
<Alfopony> 8bit ftw
*Bronysith licks fluttercry
<ShadowStep> yall should ge the comic wayyy better :)
<[Alpha]> I must getbthe game now
<Soultu> my laptop couldnt let me enjoy it because of its lag
<RAWRity> I've only had one GF, and we only went on a few real "Dates". Most of the time it was just us hanging out at my house or with other friends.
<Meanwhile> Can't imagine why, when I'm such an obviously loveable osul.
<TrueDerpyHooves> FOR EVERYONE WONDERING: NEXT: the last roudup mlp fim<3
<Basenji> I guess i will
<DIZZYRATCHET> 8bit awesome
<Meanwhile> soul*
<AlchemyGold> Yeah, I thought it was pretty good, but would have worked better as a miniseries. 7.5/10
<IIFierceDeityII> I'm hearing voices, animal noisesThe creme de la creme, the feminine abyssAnd I'm reaching my thresholdStaring at the truth 'till I'm blind
<CriticKitten> I love this movie so much, it's probably one of my favorite movies actually.
<Lil_B> yes, this defenetly sounds more like 4 bit than 8 bit XD
<Kawaii_icybeauti> YEAHHHHH PONEEEEE

<Azuredragon> dat video game Sprite
<ArcherJoe11> Still, a Harem End would have satisfied many.
<Kandarihu> The good parts and the bad parts are too much in conflict here, especially since the bad bits are so sacred. I can't give it a numerical score.
<fluttercry> 05,15dat game sprite
<Metronome> Old derpy or new derpy????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?!
<AlchemyGold> I probably would have been lost if I hadn't read the comics first
<TrueDerpyHooves> lol

<TrueDerpyHooves> HERE WE GO PONEHS!
<Spectrum_Rush> Zum: read the books and it'll be even more enjoyable
<K_A> Zum: I agree it was rushed, though. Actually, this might be a case where it's hard to really "get" it unless you've read th book.
<IIFierceDeityII> Lil_B: It sounds like its a C64

<SirGanjalf> Derpy episode?
<fluttercry> 05,15Also, if you've never seen Bonanza....where the hell have you been for the past 40 years
<Fenr> you should
<DIZZYRATCHET> yay
<JESmith71> Yeah Sumi, which version is this? Better say now, because if it's the censored you may get a bit of stupid Derpy rage
<K_A> The original books had a lot of character development scenes that were omitted, here
<Spectrum_Rush> Zum: yes thats the spirit
<Kawaii_icybeauti> SirGanjalf: Eyup
<SpeedyBolt> You know, I kinda want to live on a farm now
<TrueDerpyHooves> lol applebloom
<IIFierceDeityII> Vordox: it works rather well, actually
<SpeedyBolt> It seems so fun
<ToxicPeanut> IS this the original, when derpy talks?
<Fenr> SP - original is really great
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Sounds like a winner.
<Sabershy> Applebloom is best CMC!
<Scott-Scottaloo> 00,03inb4 Edited Derpy
<K_A> fluttercry: *shrug*
*Zum finally calls for food...
<Darkness_Pony> Notice her freckles
<TrueDerpyHooves> PWNAGE
<Fou_Lou> Zum: read them. They differ greatly.
<allponiesarebestpony> ahh yeah it better be old depy in dis episode
<Vordox> IIFierceDeityII: It's still Blasphemy:P
<Tovler> When I was a new brony, everyone was freaking out over Derpy being canon in Feeling Pinkie Keen. It weirded me out.
<Kandarihu> So, I can be sure this isn't going to be the fully censored one. Is it the original version, or is it the DVD edit?
<Rookeealding> you think they would show anything else?
<K_A> And then AJ becomes a murder.
<kidzrul434> I just had smores!

<Vordox> Wait...
<K_A> Five.
<allponiesarebestpony> :P
<RivaLz> Scott-Scottaloo Wut? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO XD
<CriticKitten> And yeah seriously, I think that was probably one of my favorite movies. It's a great nod to geek and gamer culture as a whole, it's got fantastic fight choreography and good humor. My only criticism is that it didn't last longer.
<Vordox> 10 time per year?! *GASP*
<Calcos323> champeen

<Mischief> We have you now!
<SpeedyBolt> D'aww

<SaxyPretender> 0,14Bulk and Skull are back
<TrueDerpyHooves> of flutter
<Freefall29> samurai atleast tried to emulate the classic power rangers.

<OohShiny> I say, applejack never lied in this episode

<SaxyPretender> 0,14the Rangers themselves are wonderfully hammy at times
<richfiles> Broken Pinkie Promise > The Royal We + The Royal Canterlot voice
<Meanwhile> And that's only because it has Mighty Morphin's theme.
<Darkness_Pony> YA TRICK YA
<RX-78-LazyBot> Samurai is mostly copypaste of the sentai plots
<Fenr> notice how RD was perfectly ok with murdering the bunny
<AlchemyGold> Applejack lied, but she wasn't a very convincing liar.
<desertman2> Oh right, they didn't have breakfast
<RX-78-LazyBot> the op and bulk are the only good parts
<SpeedyBolt> She's richer than us...

<OperatorPony> two femlae pegasi are outrunnign 4 sexy stallions
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Which is sort of my point. If she lies, it's supposed to be transparent. She's the bloody Element of Honesty. She shouldn't need to create technicalities to avoid being considered a liar. This is my core issue with the ep, even though I enjoy it overall. >_>
<TrueDerpyHooves> EPIC JUMP

<Rookeealding> How come that doens't get debated?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why the hell would you not be honest to your own friends?
<hen3ry> AJ forgets laws of Equestrian physics.
<Kandarihu> In my grand fanfic plan, I'm having Applejack become a military general, I just realized that this should pose an inevitable disaster.
<Xaiden|Okari> Why didn't she just get ON the train?
<AlchemyGold> I like to think Rarity and Pinkie had a wacky adventure together on their way back to Ponyville.

<JESmith71> I think Applejack was in the G3 toyline thoug
<Heathgamer> hi

<RX-78-LazyBot> Ziggy was awesome the whole way.
<TrueDerpyHooves> oh boy
<Darkness_Pony> Bitches
<SirGanjalf> Curse you RD, Curse YOUUUU!
<Soultu> xD
<otakon> Rarity will have her revenge
<EspyLacopa> Chimicherry? Cherrychanga?
<Fenr> element of murder : rarity
<joshman129> Rarity hath suffered a fate worse than death itself
*Dark92Enigma FUN FACT :l RD paid for it in the next episode........
<Pajaro> chimicherrychanga
<OohShiny> Rarity has an awesome expression
<SpeedyBolt> Cue Read it and Weep

<AlienWarhead> In two episode RD is in the hospital
<SirGanjalf> CHIMMICHERRYCHANGA
<oni_link> lmao
<Vordox> Dark92Enigma: Dang Continuity
<adros1> yay
<otakon> Freefall29: her poor mane
<RAWRity> I still love that the original MMPR cast a black kid as the Black ranger, and an asian woman for the Yellow ranger.
<AJIsAwesome> Even though Applejack is the least developed character, I stil find her my favorite. Why should you hate an episode for an undeveloped character if it adds more character development?
<K_A> Rarity getting RD back will be a highlight of S3.
<MDL> shouldn't rarity be mad at pinkie for knocking her down? XD
<ROHKARA> Actually, it would be two episodes
<Meanwhile> Ikr.
<Darkness_Pony> LOL

<Phase4> 00,02prince-dari, Ping
<Meanwhile> Racially sensitive that was not.
<ArcherJoe11> SaxyPretender: Jason was always my favourite leader. Tommy was good, but he couldn't ORDER the Morphing Time like Jason could.
<eleanorawesome> raritycatchme
<RX-78-LazyBot> SaxyPretender: I went as both the Zeo Gold ranger and the In Space Red for different holloweens
<SpeedyBolt> I just thought of something
<Rinshin> got to love pinkie pie!!!
*Dark92Enigma I'LL GET YOU NEXT TIME, RAINBOW DASH........NEXT TIME
<linx> i'd have a chat with pinkie about cherry chunga
<SpadeMagnes[R]> magmablock: JUST ASPLANNED
<Spell-of-Gaming> INTERMISSIOOOOOOOOOON
<RAWRity> Then of course, in Zeo, they had Tommy, of native american decent, playing the Red ranger. oops.
<ROHKARA> Rainbow Dash abandoned her
<DocSane> I'd ride a push car with Pinkie
<Darkness_Pony> 8/10

<SaxyPretender> 0,14Balto is A, and I'll fight any one who disagrees
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think Balto's A.
<RAWRity> loved that film as a kid!
<RX-78-LazyBot> Its also been heard that JDF's manager and Saban are in talks for him to appear in Megaforce since its second half will be an anniversary season

<SuperBrony64> 11,02The /newer/ version?!
<Silverscreen> 01,11Hmmm...is that a B movie?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the one with Nathan Lane iirc?
<Scott-Scottaloo> 00,03I... never heard of it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not sure if IMBD has the same problem with Metacritic.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01With review bombing
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: nope. But it's based around a moment not very big outside of the US's history
<fluttercry> 05,15That's....not a B movie
<RX-78-LazyBot> >not the original producers with Gene Wilder
<Meanwhile> Oh god inb4 a thousand rerolls.
<fluttercry> 05,15But, it is Mel Brooks....
<Shizuka> 13Nittany_Discord: that people vote all perfect or all terribad, yeah
<Ninjazz> Gotta see this.
<otakon> no
<EspyLacopa> Good lord. Where as Gondor when we finally set down concrete rules on what separates a B movie from an A movie?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02fluttercry: It's not his version :<
<otakon> The Producers is a B
<Sumica> 00,10the 2005 is melbrooks? you sure?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It's the remake.
<fluttercry> 05,15oh...
<Silverscreen> 01,11No, the older one is Mel
<Scott-Scottaloo> 00,03Good enough?
<Silverscreen> 01,11This one is the remake
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I said the one with Nathan lane =P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Here's comes Will Ferrel as the German guy...
<RAWRity> nah, The Producers remake's definitely A
<otakon> Matthew Broderick? Nathan Lane? yeahit's a B
<SaxyPretender> 0,14unless that's the musical...
<Scott-Scottaloo> 00,03Natahn Lane! ODST FTW!
<Meanwhile> Apparently whenever they try EspyLacopa they all get headaches and fall asleep and can't remember what they were doing when they wake up.
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395251/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Never saw the original The Producers.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...that's Nathan FILLION, Scott-Scottaloo
<Scott-Scottaloo> 00,03wow, my keyboard sucks...
<IshHypotheticallyInL> my browser crashed, whats the B selection?
<Scott-Scottaloo> 00,03Wait... really?
<fluttercry> 05,1551% on Rotton tomatoes
<Silverscreen> 01,11No, this is an A movie.
<SaxyPretender> 0,1451% on RT?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14sounds like a B to me
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...that rhymed
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'd say keep it, I'd love to see The Producers shown.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:P
<fluttercry> 05,15yup. pretty much
<otakon> okay if it's 51% that's a B
<RAWRity> apparently average ratings count as B movie now? what?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Yeah, go for it!
<otakon> no
<EspyLacopa> IshHypotheticallyInL: The Producers.
<Ninjazz> SaxyPretender being all Zecora.
<Meanwhile> I don't even know anymore.
<RAWRity> 51's an average to middling film.
<Saturn> 08,01THE PRODUCERS! \o/
<Sumica> 00,10moveing on then
<Silverscreen> 01,11Bleh. Fine. Balto and The Producers (2005) it is.
<IshHypotheticallyInL> Which one EspyLacopa?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Now... for the pony episodes :|
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>.>
<EspyLacopa> The 2005 one.
<Silverscreen> 01,11Time for ponehz.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^
<Saturn> 08,01i don't watch films more than once in the cinema
<Shizuka> 13so much kvetching...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that's my word
<Saturn> 08,01there are very few exceptions that rule
<SaxyPretender> 0,14;___;
<Saturn> 08,01the 2005 The Producers was one of them
<RAWRity> by that definition, the transformers movies would count as B
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So you like Hitler on Ice?
<EspyLacopa> As a note, if higher rating = A movie, then "Rocky Horror Picture Show" would be an A movie. 76% on rotten tomatoes.
<Meanwhile> The Transformers movies suck though.
<otakon> enope
<SaxyPretender> 0,14falls under the cult classic bit
<EspyLacopa> BAH
<RX-78-LazyBot> Saxy, you must put more shame on Scoot-Scootaloo for confusing Nathan Lane with Nathan Fillion

<Silverscreen> 01,11Eh, not bad.
<EspyLacopa> If you fellows can't set up concrete rules for A and B movies, then stop dumping movies that don't meet your nebulous requirements.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We got some Luna in the season finale.

<Azuredragon> that is a fun face
<Spell-of-Gaming> Fun Face loooooool
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when Fun Face?
<Sabershy> Silverscreen: That's true. However he wasn't really able to overcome his issues since he didn't catch his uncle's killer though. Plus, i found his attitude more closer to the joke-cracking Webslinger we know from the comics.
<Spectrum_Rush> FAEC
<Pale_Horse> Additional railings!
<infernap12> who i give my email to?

<DocSane> Wait... Do those hooves have thumbs?
<Meanwhile> Eh, tbh if this movie's really that long I might just go to bed.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sabershy, for me anything that is as close to the comics is great
<otakon> but I really want the BR release of Holy Grail

<Meanwhile> Neither is milk actually.
<Silverscreen> 01,11Sabershy: I guess, but it rubs me the wrong way that they're turning Spidey into more of an anti-hero rather than the straight up hero he's always been known as.

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Okay... maybe not on christmas..
<Silverscreen> 01,11Vordox: That's the vibe I got, especially during the scene between Parker and Captain Stacey
<Dog_Major> Scoot-Scootaloo: then can I ask for a favor on Dec. 18??? :3
<RX-78-LazyBot> Saxy sounds like he just took it up the rear by surprise
<OohShiny> I feel a sudden craving for Minecraft
<Pale_Horse> Ponies do need to be able to hold stuff. Unicorns can't be the only ponies capable of fine manipulation.

<Silverscreen> 01,11Twilight_Sprinkle: as for as anything new or innovative, you're right, nothing to take from this movie. But I have to say, it's wonderfully entertaining and asks a lot of challenging questions. It's also well paced and well acted, and gives a lot to think about if you look past the simple story.

<Slowter> Slow down lady, my body is not ready
<Shawn> BITE THE PILLOW IM GOING IN DRY!
<Kandarihu> Cannibal, Cannibal, Eat me Raw. Boil me with kisses... <forgot the rest>
<Rookeealding> some of these lyrics...
<Tassadork> 165 minutes. 2:45
<Nyst> But, the Mayans weren't cannibals...
<Sumica> 00,10the other ones kinda fit the theme but this.

<RosePetal> Ahahah.
<Rookeealding> Big lipped aligator movie
<TheXIIILightning> DocSane: Everything I know about this movie came from AVGN, I'm quite hyped XD
<WRITEity> 155 or 174 depending on which cut
<fluttercry> 05,15Nobody C C C C Combo broke that?
<CriticKitten> Try Big Lipped Alligator Movie.
<Shawn> i think the mean nipples not dimples
<Lil> lool Director just wanted to visit south america
<Fenr> how much of it is actually left?it's getting kind of late but i can't go to sleep wiithout seeing the end at this point XD
<fluttercry> 05,15So like.....wut
<Silverscreen> 01,11The strange thing about this movie...is that everyone (sans the villain) is justifiable for being jackasses. The robot's justifyable seeing that he know understands the concept of worth and expresses it. the professor's justifyable since the robot quite litterally destroyed his passion and dreams. The girl's is also justifyable because she's caught in the middle of it all, and the
<Silverscreen> 1,11professor's co-workers were justified in that they just wanted credit for their hard work.
<WRITEity> eeyup
<inkBot> I'm guessing they throw in something that hasn't got anything to do with the movie so they can use it for publicity without spoiling the story?
<OohShiny> this movie... is long
<Nyst> Fenr: it's over halfway done.
<owloysius> Fenr: uhh, an hour?
<CriticKitten> Literally this entire movie can be described as "suddenly, something else happened"
<DocSane> TheXIIILightning: I saw it in February at the Boston Sci Fi Marathon.
<WRITEity> Bunti Aur Babli was longer
<richfiles> CRAP!!! Dat sudden rain and open car windows and... Oh hay.. Song's still going! :D :$
<Tovler> Alpaca for Season 3!
<Mischief> European movie night is going to come before this ends
<AttacktheAndalite> He looked so unsure just now
<JESmith71> Yeah it's 155 minutes
<Fenr> shit,5:35am now,guess i wont sleep then XD
<WRITEity> one day, we have to watch "Sholay"
<RosePetal> Paen.
<DocSane> TheXIIILightning: I think I went into the lobby during this song.
<Canadian_Brony> JESmith71 the song?!?
<fluttercry> 05,15billions of tissues?
<StinkomanFan> Just like Luna's last choice, although this one started good
<Rookeealding> suddenly another side of the earth
<Slowter> So many people have been in the wrong in this movie
<Meanwhile> How long is that?
<JESmith71> No the movie
<Xaiden|Okari> What's playing next????????
<TheXIIILightning> She's a soaked fruit... giggity
<fluttercry> 05,15Sounds like Friday Night to me
<CriticKitten> ....
<Shawn> mmm i like biting chicks
<WRITEity> it has a scene where a man with no arms kicks his enemies to death.
<Ryunosuke> she's... wet
<Megan> hmm fold...nah i dont get it
<Rookeealding> So.... does the robot come back?
<Dynamic> How far are we in the movie
<Sumica> 00,101 hour left
<owloysius> lol
<RosePetal> Sexual Innudeno.
<AttacktheAndalite> fluttercry: lol
<Shooeie> Wat am I watching? It was a movie a few minutes ago.
<Dynamic> oh
<Nyst> Soaked fruit? What?
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: i wouldnt call killing someone justifiable, just because he didnt do what you want
<Meanwhile> Huh.
<CriticKitten> "Bite me slowly". NEED AN ADULT.
<[Alpha]> :[
<StinkomanFan> We need to see MATRIOSKA!
<owloysius> Sumi: whoa, i was just kidding
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen does that Justify that she was playing whore?
<Tovler> meh. Watchmen is over 200 minutes
<otakon> anyone elses stream just buffer there?
<DocSane> Rookeealding: Keep watching. The movie's title is "Robot" after all.
<Lil> I look at the songs as a type of intermission
<Canadian_Brony> I'm regretting reading the subtitles
<Spriggals> watch like the rest of the movie be this
<comradebrony> really AVGN?
<StinkomanFan> 5000 hours of a single image
<pony_300> I think I've heard this hook before
<Rookeealding> ....oh dear
<Shawn> http://epicfreeprizes.com/?ref=468247
<Dark92Enigma> WE NEED A SONIC SAYS
<Mischief> Parental Guidence is suggested.
<Meanwhile> Aha aha
<hen3ry> I'm not watching subtitles of songs anymore
<Shawn> i dare u to click it
<fluttercry> 05,15Pretty sure this is all a giant metaphor for them having sex
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: you think?
<Canadian_Brony> fluttercry seems legit
<Megan> POMPADOAR
<Sumica> 00,10you are probably right fluttercry
<Shawn> dat ass
<RosePetal> Now they are just repeating lyrics.
<Rookeealding> I thought she didn't like when he counted their kisses
<hen3ry> I'm eating what's either the best or the worst kitchen sink stew I've made ever.
<AttacktheAndalite> fluttercry: *nic cage face*
<WRITEity> We should watch Andy Worhol's "Empire"
<Kandarihu> I can't wait to see what Saturn thinks of this whole movie, since he is of Indian descent.
<AlienWarhead> Sometimes I think we have pony episodes after the movies to keep our sanity
<Dark92Enigma> DATS NOT GOOD
<DocSane> Singing about Kilimanjaro in the ANdes. Sure..
<Sumica> 00,10I recall one like this in the one luna picked
<AttacktheAndalite> Mmm, butts
<Silverscreen> 01,11twilight_Sprinkle: He created Chitti to help the world. Chitti failed that mission in openly defying his creator. From that standpoint, he was completely justified.
<Rinshin> i told him that madness
<Shooeie> I guess Singing is sex for people in India
<Shawn> derp
<OohShiny> they are having sex
<Canadian_Brony> Sumi what did she pick?
<RosePetal> She's a bitch that's why.
<Meanwhile> AttacktheAndalite: My thoughts exactly.
<WRITEity> It's an 8 hour static shot of the Empire State Building
<OohShiny> and they use the song to distract us
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> =/
<CriticKitten> fluttercry: So this movie is implying that their sex is....like a giant dance sequence in Peru?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Next person to advertise a referral link gets banned.
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: doesnt mean youre supposed to kill it!
<Sumica> 00,10Bunti and Bundy or somthing like that
<richfiles> Intermissio indeed! :) I had time to get dressed, grab my keys, go out into the rain, and shut my car's windows... and the song is STIIIIIIL going! :D
<DocSane> I'm a skin instrument?!
<owloysius> CriticKitten: isn't it always
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile: Which part, the butts or the nic cage?
<RosePetal> Pleasure.
<Megan> a walking ass :/
<Luna> 07,01correct Summie :)
<Meanwhile> AttacktheAndalite: Butt.
<Shooeie> What am I watching?
<Pudge> AN HOUR LEFT!!!!!!!11
<Pudge> WHAT
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...that metaphor
<DocSane> I'm a skin instrument?!!!!!!!!!!!
<RosePetal> Who wrote these lyrics?
<Ryunosuke> ...
<Ryunosuke> woodpecker?
<cratorkid> Nittany_Discord: is bringin down the hammer
<Canadian_Brony> I'm not gonna look that up
<TheXIIILightning> 100 grams waist...
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, you here?
<Silverscreen> 01,11twilight_sprinkle: Did he kill it or simple dismantle a machine like it was a regular computer?
<StinkomanFan> Actually, we need HORROR
<StrayPony> This is the filthiest song I've heard in a long time
<Slowter> Really? an hour left?
<WRITEity> then there's Andy Warhol's "Vinyl", which is a retelling fo "A Clockwork Orange" done in a single take.
<RosePetal> Hed killed it.
<TheXIIILightning> She's a Scootaloo!
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile: *wraps an arm around your shoulder* Innuendoes, innuendoes everywhere
<RustyMeat> yeha eat dat grass
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dude, they are kinky
<RosePetal> Scootlaoo.
<Pale_Horse> Tigers eat grass? I'm not from India but I'm pretty sure they dont... :(
<inkBot> what, seriously? one hour left?
<Nyst> I don't think this movie can tell the difference between a robot (machine) and an AI (computer)
<owloysius> Silverscreen: he dismantled it. I think it might be restored
<Kandarihu> Silverscreen, he dismantled Chitti with a fireaxe and a beaker of acid.
<Spectrum_Rush> mica
<Shooeie> Scootaloos?
<RosePetal> ahahaha.
<Canadian_Brony> Silverscreen he destroyed it with an axe
<StinkomanFan> Human Centipede or A Serbian Film. Which would you prefer?
<hen3ry> Not that kind of grass lol
<Meanwhile> AttacktheAndalite: *Pokerface*
<JESmith71> An hour really? Since it's 155 min I thought it'd just be 30 left
<Dark92Enigma> TheXIIILightning: What do you mean everything on this movie came from AVGN?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14haHA
<Shawn> what the fuck?
<[Alpha]> I seem to be less suceptable to anger when I sleep more than 4 hours
<CriticKitten> I liked Luna's Bollywood pick, too. This movie's been amazing but I don't think it's had a single song as memorable as the one from the middle of Bunti aur Babli.
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: he killed it, and killed it like a person, he killed it with rage. if it were pure dismantling, he should scrapped it for parts, or fix it, keep working on it
<WRITEity> Serbian Film would never make it in.
<RosePetal> There was an intermission.
<Mischief> oh my
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<Canadian_Brony> How long has this gone on?
<Slowter> Phffffffffttttttttttttttt
<Meanwhile> No way in hell.
<AttacktheAndalite> and now I'm tempted to to find this song and download it.
<Sumica> 00,10ah hell
<Dark92Enigma> CAUSE THIS IS FILLER!
<AlienWarhead> I think we needed a 10 minute break at the intermission part of the movie
<Ryunosuke> suddenly back in india
<Rookeealding> OH Hi movie
<Dark92Enigma> FILLER TIME
<pony_300> that hook was catchy
<StinkomanFan> Human Centapede it is!
