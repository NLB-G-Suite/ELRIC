<prince-dari> Mainly acting, but bit of both
<SpeedyBolt> HI YOU
<cratorkid> i feel everybody forgets dragons are immune to fire
<Eleanor> owwww
<soul> awesome owl
<Whovianpony> one badass owl
<Phase4> 00,02OWL Vs DRAGON
<YorkBrony> who? its a dragon dummy
<Phase4> 00,02OWL WINS
<CoalDust> 'who' could that be
<GarrettBrony> oh
<owloysius> hoo?
<Darf14> Owl > Dragon
<megan> the green dragons name is leviathan
<Bronysith> righto
<otakon> Phase4: well if he was FIGHTING him then yeah, but distraction works
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And this dragon doesnt burn the whole forrest down why?
<Ponies47> Phase4: eeyup :P
<pony_9669> Yikes! It sounds like unit 01
<Reikim> So instead I pushed it onto a bit of paper and tossed it outside. And when it got out in the sunlight, I realized that it was actually quite a nice bug. Its shell was a nice shade of blue.
<AlienWarhead> Random thought Season 3 needs more Tank
<Dark92Enigma> Insert: Gogeta's magnificent scene
<OohShiny> when that owl attacks the dragon, it remembers me of the Basilisk on HP
<lunac> Twilight should be apologgising to Spike as it;s her words that drove him indirectly to near death.
<ThunderStrike> LIGHT SPELL
<SpadeMagnes[R]> USE YOUR OWN IDIOT
<Phase4> 00,02AlienWarhead, yup
<OohShiny> when Falkes attacks the dragon
<SpadeMagnes[R]> *HORN
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Cant see
<lunac> And Twilight LIGHT SPELL
<OohShiny> Basilisk
<ECP48> Burn down the forest
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Doesnt use horn
<cher3ry> I suspect tank will never be seen again except in a brief background shot.
<pony_1387> then how did u get there
*Dark92Enigma GUILE'S THEME GOES WITH THIS
<Reikim> So that was my epiphanic moment.
<Ponies47> Random thought season 3 needs more crazy Twilight
<Phase4> 00,02we need scoots episode
<otakon> cher3ry: I hope not
<Kammerjunk> Reikim: You remind me of the Story from North America.
<otakon> Phase4: and a AJ song
<SpadeMagnes[R]> GEE I DONT KNOW
<Kurra> we do.
<Reikim> ...What?
<Squallken> she told you, fluttershy told you and you did not listen
<FaithHeart> more applejack
<SpeedyBolt> Another Pinkie and Dashie episode.
<Sumica> 00,10Tank died after dash set him down on a cloud
<Kammerjunk> I'd link it, but stream and stuff.
<Pudgeotto> daaaaaaaaaaw
<SpeedyBolt> Like Griffon the Brush off.

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Maybe he ran away because you acted like you didnt give a shit?!
<FaithHeart> and more Sweetie Belle
<Bronysith> Phase4: and an applejack episode
<lunac> More like her best servant
<Reikim> Explain it, then.
<inkBot> assistant first, friend second
<Ponies47> Sumica: O.O
<SpeedyBolt> Except without the hate.
<megan> oh...i thought he was her pet................
<K_A> So does Twilight ever sleep?
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, we have aj episode
<Bronysith> Phase4: eerr. applejack song
<Dark92Enigma> ECP48 Pinkie Pie

<SpeedyBolt> So that's one checkmark
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> *guessing
<owloysius> hoo?
<pony_8035> I wonder at what point Spike will get tired of being called a baby. It's implied by the greed episode that he'll never grow up like this.
<StuffCrusader> hoo
<ECP48> Where did that swamp come from
<K_A> megan: I would say he's sapient, but pets and farm animals are weird in Equestria.

<Bronysith> my singing has been known to get multiple guns pointed at me

<K_A> "This week, I..."
<AttacktheAndalite> DERK A DERRRR!

<lunac> Nittahy_Discord sorry for asking.
<Reikim> It's not alive, but it moves...the implications are horrid.
*Bronysith eats Meanwhile s shoes
<Meanwhile> Whatever that abomination is it is from the darkest reaches of the hearts of men, where mortals fear to tread and the blackness consumes your dreams.
<Pudgeotto> Hey Kirzstryfe: I'll play with you guys
<otakon> Sumica: can't, just the view image link

<Kammerjunk> Oh, wow. http://fyre-flye.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4axk45 <- This is what the Ursa Major was originally going to be.
<Shizuka> 13i want one
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm going insane from boredom.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: dude, at least you have net man.
<Ponies47> Ohai LoGaN :P
<Kammerjunk> wat
*LoGaN ties Ponies47 to a chair
<Reikim> Hey Shizu. Um. Are you sure about that/
<Reikim> ?
<soul> like a signature?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: I was about to break into someones house to reset the router man.
<CriticKitten> I suppose I can play, though I don't think I've done Worms in ....god, forever. ._. I'll grab a copy though.
<Ponies47> LoGaN: Lemme go! D:
<otakon> soul: lower right
<LoGaN> :D never!
<soul> i know :P
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord I wish my computer worked. The piece of *yay* won't boot up until you've tried about 50 times
<Pudgeotto> hold on my steam is freezing up
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mine turns on, but doesn't boot.
<Meanwhile> Well Shizuka if you really want it you can get it here. http://derpy.me/axGrk
*Reikim whistles idly
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So, yeah...
<LoGaN> is anypony streaming?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: no boot, that's happened to me before
<Reikim> So does anyone here have any good ideas for killing time?
<Lunar_Brony> Pudgeotto the stream is down.
<Pudgeotto> no I mean Steam
<ChronoClutch> the fun is about to be doubled!
<ChronoClutch> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcQrRwC2WDQ
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I took it apart today and put it back together hoping it would magically work.
<Bronysith> Reikim: i suggest a .357 revolver and a grandfather clock
<Shizuka> 13oo an instant autojoin, i like this idea
<CoalDust> silence
<Reikim> ?
<Pudgeotto> I'll brb
<CoalDust> ...
<Muffin0> my computer wont work either it crashed completely and needs to be restored, but i dont have the recovery disk
<Tom> 14If you want to play, add me on steam, nick is TomDaBoulder69
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: time to take it to a professional or get a new one man.
<Reikim> I'm confused now.
<Meanwhile> It's set up across the client, but ofc mane chat has the blocker for just this reason.
<Pudgeotto> gotta get off here, later
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can't afford a new one.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> how appropriate
<Sumica> 00,10ah yes the magic of just dismanteling it making it work
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If I could, I would have parts on the way.
<Sumica> 00,10I always wondered about that one
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was worth a shot Sumica.
<killerpony7733> Muffin0: I'm in the same situation with my gaming laptop
<Reikim> Instant autojoin?
<sonicandmario85> Muffin0:use the windows disk that came with it and re-install windows that might work
<Sumica> 00,10no I know nitt I have done it as well
<sonicandmario85> Muffin0:i tried it before and it worked
<Lunar_Brony> I'm planning on building a new computer
<Lunar_Brony> but I'm broke
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: You can lose everything on it if you do that
<LoGaN> * twitch
<Meanwhile> In the event that I am removed from a channel, my client will automatically reconnect me to it. Unless it's preventing autojoin or a ban is in effect.
<Muffin0> sonicandmario85 i have no disks for it whatsoever it got handed down to me
<NewDCD> 09,01wise fwom yo glaive
<Reikim> Ah
<Sumica> 00,10I think I have a spare MB and processer around here somwhere
<Lunar_Brony> hi NewDCD
<Shamroc> oh ello NewDCD
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: more than likely with what happened to my crappy E-Machines was the motherboard randomly fried while it was OFF and plugged into a surge protector
<sonicandmario85> killerpony7733:you can re-install it or put it on a disk or USB
<owloysius> Ia! Ia! Cthulu ftaghn
<Reikim> Oh
<Reikim> OH
<otakon> hiya NewDCD how ya been?
<xxMoopyxx> I am your host the man they call ghost
<Sumica> 00,10Oh what cha selling today dcd?
<Meanwhile> Calm down.
<AttacktheAndalite> Hi NewDCD
<Reikim> I get it now
<NewDCD> 09,01I have a most shameless question
<Reikim> Sorry, when I suddenly understand things that happens.
<Lunar_Brony> ask away
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: When the laptop can't go beyond where it goes *starting windows*?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01otakon: I think it's either the MB or power supply.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can't afford a new MB.
<AttacktheAndalite> What is it, NewDCD?
<CoalDust> later
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: sounds about right
<NewDCD> 09,01If I sent one of you $150 in Paypal, could you use your credit cards to get $150 worth of Amazon Gift Cards for me? O:
<Meanwhile> :3
<NewDCD> 09,01I kinda need AGCs and well yeah
<Kandarihu> If only we could do another Bronyfunds event to raise money for Nittany_Discord's computer
<sonicandmario85> killerpony7733:your screwed then bro
<Bronysith> Reikim: most people would say EUREKA
<Bronysith> or fuck yea i did it
<Shamroc> NewDCD: and why not do it yourself?
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, I just realised something.
<Bronysith> but you arent most people
<otakon> NewDCD: dude, best you did that with someone you trust IMPLICTEDLY
<Meanwhile> Anyhoo yeah, now that I know Shizu hates that bug I'm keeping it on hand.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: I was thinking of doing a contest to raise the money.
<otakon> Shamroc: he lives in.. where again NewDCD?
<Reikim> What has Kammerjunk realized?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I only need $150
<NewDCD> 09,01because I don't have a credit card to do so
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Less, actually.
<Kammerjunk> Twilight's eyes go white when she enters that Avatar State or whatever. Mentally, she probably undergoes a change.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Since I can use some of the money I have to pay for it.
<Kammerjunk> I can use that!
<Shizuka> 13he has realized you don't want to taunt shizu
<Pudgeotto> Hey kirzstryfe: i sent you a friend request
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Say, raise $100 to buy a new motherboard.
<AttacktheAndalite> NewDCD: I would if I had a Paypal and my debit card would get through
<sonicandmario85> team avo deserves ice cream :3
<Lunar_Brony> NewDCD I would suggest going to a store and buying a Visa Giftcard, but they have a $15 activation fee
<Reikim> Pool noodle of banning is reason enough not to taunt anyone.
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, that's an adorable bug.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sell my copy of BF3. That's $60 right there (it's unopened).
<Meanwhile> Oh be a sport Shiz, I'm not exactly in the newfoal camp.
<ChronoClutch> my pc has http://uberhumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/One-Megabite-PIC.png
<Lunar_Brony> to me, it's worth the extra payment for MLP merchandise
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: you'll never sell it brand new despite it being brand new.
<CoalDust> well im out, later
*Bronysith noms on Meanwhile s socks
<Lunar_Brony> but that's me
<ChronoClutch> one mega bite :D
<Meanwhile> In fact hell, I've been here longer than you have.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: at best, 40 bucks if only bc it's "old"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01People will still buy it new.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even on PC.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even though EA is so hated.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: could try Amazon though man, they take stuff like that in new/like new condition pretty well.
<Reikim> Actually, out of curiosity, who's the oldest member on here?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Actually, maybe I could sell it because EA is hated.
<Shizuka> 13sigh
<sonicandmario85> im scratching my balls right now :3
<Meanwhile> That'd be DCD Val or Ghosties.
<AttacktheAndalite> sonicandmario85: Dude, ew and TMI
<Lunar_Brony> TMI, bro
<Reikim> What about in this room?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Copy of BF3 that isn't used. EA doesn't get a cent. Just a PC copy.
<Meanwhile> Dari.
<Kammerjunk> So I'm sitting here at 6 AM, listening to the background music of Pinkie Pie's psychotic moment in Party of One.
<Kammerjunk> It's unsettling.
<megan> NOT TMI
<sonicandmario85> im scratching them through my pants got a problem with that?
<megan> SAY MORE
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: sorry man, Amazn doesn't even TAKE PC copies

<Kencolt> sonicandmario85: I think it's more that there was no need for the announcement.
<Lunar_Brony> I need to throw up now
<Kammerjunk> prince-dari: When did you join BronyState?
<AttacktheAndalite> sonicandmario85: Still, you wouldn't do that in a middle of a crowd or a bus.
<Reikim> prince-dari: Oh, just wondering who the oldest member in this room is. Just so happens to be you.
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: you okay man?
<Kammerjunk> Now you've gone and amde me curious, Meanwhile.
<Kammerjunk> made*

<Lunar_Brony> otakon yeah, never better. I-
<Reikim> That happens weekly now?
*Bronysith noms on popcorn
<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: Isn't that what 4chan consists of?
*Lunar_Brony gag
<Shizuka> 13eventually it'll be daily i'm certain
<sonicandmario85> they were itchy so i scratched them :3
<AttacktheAndalite> sonicandmario85: That's why we have bathrooms.
<otakon> sonicandmario85: dude, enough. that's disruptive so stop or you'll be kicked or banned.
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: this is not 4chan
<Muffin0> i found a disk!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Kammerjunk: thats really only a /b/ and /v/ thing
<Kencolt> Well, I'm off for now. Probably be back laters. Ciao.
<Lunar_Brony> Muffin0 a disk for what?
*AttacktheAndalite gets Lunar_Brony a trash can
*Kencolt waves.
<Lunar_Brony> bye Kencolt
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: You're not taking this seriously are you? Because if you are that's my bad and I was just teasing about the bug.
<Lunar_Brony> thx AttacktheAndalite
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: Oh, but on 4chan - Or at least /b/ and /v/, apparently - such happens constantly.
<Muffin0> my computer to work again!
<AttacktheAndalite> You're welcome *pats on the back*
<Bronysith> yea
<Bronysith> but this is not 4chan
<Lunar_Brony> Muffin0 great!
<otakon> night Ken...dammit
<RX-78-SweetieBot> maybe /a/ as well
<Kammerjunk> Good Goddesses, of course it's not.
<Reikim> One of the best attributes on Bronystate is that seniority counts for little. All bronies are equal.
<Lunar_Brony> AttacktheAndalite stop . . . please . . .
<prince-dari> [05:05] <Kammerjunk> prince-dari: When did you join BronyState?

<Reikim> Also compounding this fact is that the oldest child is the "test" child.
<GilDash|Nurse> G'night everypony! :)
<Pudgeotto> sonicandmario85: are you gonna play with us?
<Mutterguy> jynx :p
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> yes he is where were you
<soul> epic vid :P
<sub06905|BF3> Watch out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaYAC5PtjD8&feature=plcp
<kirzstryfe> 8,6yes, working on setting up atm
<Kammerjunk> I'm an oldest child at 16. I have a sister on 14 and another at 1. There ain't no goddamn difference.
<MahBoi777> gnight GilDash|Nurse! take care^^
<Shizuka> 13oldest child gets all the good stuff, until the next child arrives
<Bronysith> i am youngest at 18
<Kammerjunk> Well, my sister has a terrible taste in music, but that's irrelevant.
<Shizuka> 13then you're on your own
<Lunar_Brony> g'night GilDash|Nurse
<Reikim> Shizu knows how it works.
<MahBoi777> Spectrum_Rush|Awake: mind blown
<Lunar_Brony> afk
<sonicandmario85> Pudgeotto:no sorry i only have the demo verison ):
<Bronysith> my elder brother is 20 and eldest is 24
<Reikim> I can testify in support of Shizu's statement.
<Pudgeotto> sonicandmario85: its only 6 bucks for the full version
<Pudgeotto> i just bought it
*Spectrum_Rush|Zzz yawns
<sonicandmario85> my parents wont get it they are broke
<CriticKitten> Doin' setup myself. This is always such an annoyance. xD
<Reikim> Now that that's settled, time to go play some more Myst.
<Bronysith> have fun raging
<prince-dari> Meh, I didn't really have that with my sister.
*Bronysith noms on prince-dari
<prince-dari> Though maybe because we never tend to really want anything.
<Reikim> Man, you got lucky.
<Pudgeotto> Hey kirzstryfe: How long are you gonna play it?
<Kammerjunk> prince-dari: Same here.
<soul> im watching a mix of smile smile smile and meet the pyro
<soul> :P
<Reikim> My sister also tends to generally hate me no matter what situation we're in.
<prince-dari> I remember a while ago I had ~£500 in cash because I just didn't eat lunch at school for a couple years
<prince-dari> Never spent any of it because I don't really want anything
<kirzstryfe> 8,6until we get bored or too tired, at least for tonight
<prince-dari> Just ended up putting it in the bank
<Pudgeotto> okay because i'm redownloading it and it's gonna take over an hour
<Pudgeotto> :<
<Reikim> Good use of money, that.
<sonicandmario85> Rainbow dash is best flyer :3
<Shamroc> Pudgeotto: darn
<Shamroc> kirzstryfe: how long till you think you can get the stream up?
<soul> why isnt RD part of the wonderbolts?
<Bronysith> i just burn it
<sonicandmario85> she proaly will...in season 3 XD
<Shizuka> 13it's the logical end of her character arc
<sonicandmario85> probaly*
<Bronysith> soul: why doesnt applejack have her own song?
<Shamroc> soul: cause she's to immature...and well i dont think she really knows what the wonderbolts do on a daily basis being the "best flying squad in equestria"
<Shizuka> 13similar to twilight becoming, i dunno, master librarian at canterlot or something
<Bronysith> Shizuka: archmage
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, I just noticed. Faust's original design for the Ursa Major had a symbol on it's forehead.
<Kammerjunk> http://fyre-flye.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4axk45 A very interesting symbol.
<otakon> nah
<otakon> there is no archmage
<otakon> probably teacher at Canterlot university or some such
<xxMoopyxx> Hey whats going on guys was there anti brony in here or what?
<otakon> xxMoopyxx: um not really or I missed him. what happened to your friend?
<Shizuka> 13point being joining the wonderbolts is the logical end for rainbow dash as a character, once she's got that what major tension is left?
<sonicandmario85> backflip :3
<otakon> Shizuka: hmmm excellent point.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RD will join the wonderbolts at the end of the series.
<Kammerjunk> ...I like that kinda thing. It helps me think of stuff to write about that I'll just end up putting on a "To-Do" list anyway.
<xxMoopyxx> oh hes coming soon just give him some time
<Mutterguy> true all we'd have then is the shipping
*otakon hugs Shizuka "MY NET IS BACK!" and jumps about while holding her.
<soul> has anyone here ever converted a parasprite into a brony?
<owloysius> RD x pie
<otakon> soul: it happens
<Meanwhile> Turns out the Sparkle family is descended from Ursa's.
<Shizuka> 13the series finale, or a lead up to it, imagine that one of the mane six drops out as we approach the finale, would have rainbow dash joining wonderbolts, fluttershy... i dunno getting a job in cloudsdale
<otakon> soul: but not me personally.
<xxMoopyxx> so what did the anti brony say?
<Reikim> I still need to write a bunch of things.
<Reikim> The least of which is a short fic about Fluttershy and Chrysalis.
<Mutterguy> Ninjazz apparently was one by his one testimony
<otakon> xxMoopyxx: no idea, I missed it.
<Bronysith> what?
<xxMoopyxx> i missed it to
<Reikim> Yup.
<soul> twilight and rarity have to go to canterlot
<Bronysith> chrysalis x fluttershy ?
<Reikim> No
<Shamroc> Shizuka..rarity getting a job offer as a more higher class designer in canterlot..
<Reikim> God no
<Reikim> Why
<soul> or just twilight
<otakon> wait wait
<Reikim> Why would you assume it's a ship
<Bronysith> o thank you sweet merciful molestia
<otakon> REsident Evil is getting aNOTHER movie?
<otakon> GODDAMMIT
<soul> and AJ and pinkie pie...
<Reikim> I'm disappointed, man
<Bronysith> considering lots of fanfics are ships
<Shamroc> otakon...another....fucking A hollywood stop milking!
<Reikim> What do you take me for?
<Unnr|Laptop> Bruce Campbell is a god!
<Sumica> 00,10reminds me of how bebop ended Shizuka
<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: I like that idea.
<Bronysith> i believe the term is
<Bronysith> who the hell do you think i am
<sonicandmario85> BACKFLIP
<Biglaw> Hey everypony!
<Mutterguy> actually Pinkie pie's , Applejack's and Fluttershy's lives are pretty static
<sonicandmario85> BUT DAD THAT WAS A FRONTFLIP
<soul> discord comes back?
<otakon> Shamroc: wait I'm wrong! it's a CG one
<AttacktheAndalite> sonicandmario85: I DON'T CAAAAAAA-
<sonicandmario85> DONT QUESTION ME!
<Reikim> Anyway, I chose those two for symbolic and metaphorical purposes.
<Shizuka> 13that was my base sumica
<Shizuka> 13would be a fitting end
<Shamroc> otakon...ok that...makes it a little better
<soul> idk
<otakon> Shamroc: and it actually has SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE GAMES
<Reikim> The idea is that Chrysalis will eventually be redeemed and metamorphose.
<Shizuka> 13except fim season one didn't introduce the mane six as slowly
<otakon> Shamroc: Leon and Ada are in it.
<Shamroc> otakon...i am now dead..
<Kammerjunk> Oh, that's a neat idea.
<Sumica> 00,10well save for some one dieing, I dont think I could take that as an ender
<Biglaw> sonicandmario85: BARRELS!
<Meanwhile> She'll be redeemed alright
<Meanwhile> Into a big smouldering crater.
<otakon> Shamroc: it's the sequel to that last CGI RE movie with Leon in it.
<Bronysith> so is worms reloaded... team deathmatch?
<Pudgeotto> iI dont think any of the mane 6 are going to die
<Shamroc> otakon.....oh neat...having watched every one so far multiple times
<Reikim> This idea crystallized out of a weird moment I had out of nowhere, where I thought that butterflies are really quite tragic creatures.
<Mutterguy> more importantly....Spike (somehow) gets the girl
<Shamroc> Bronysith: yes...or FFA
<sonicandmario85> Son:DAD IM EATING YOUR PENIS Dad:fucking penis engulfer I HATE YOU SO MUCH SON
<Kurra> is there a stream up?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://nittany-tiger.tumblr.com/ <- if you want to help me get back streaming.
<sonicandmario85> no
<xxMoopyxx> Keep the anti bronies out guys keep up the good work yall
<Reikim> Beautiful but short-lived. Living on the line between the beauty of life and the finality of death.
<Shizuka> 13sonicandmario85: That's... not appropriate. Don't do it again.
<otakon> WHO WANT'S TO DONATE SOME MOOLAH TO OUR FINE MOD NITTANY?
<otakon> I would, but I'm broke :(
<Shamroc> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not asking for donations.
<otakon> and it sucks balls
<Reikim> Chrysalis > butterflies > Fluttershy
<Muffin0> nittany what is your OS
<soul> i cant
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's hard to raise money.
*Kurra missed all the great character discussion :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Learned that from Bronyfunds.
<Reikim> The train of thought was, I guess, inevitable.
<Kurra> I think Dashie should become an adoptive mom. That'd be way more fitting end for her.
<Lunar_Brony> I'm back. Did I miss anything spectacular?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Muffin0: Windows 7.
<Mutterguy> I would. I would also like to spend $150 in the steam sale but i can't remember some of my online banking details
<Shamroc> Lunar_Brony: nooooope
<Kammerjunk> For some reason, this all reminds me of I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream. Specifically the intro when AM says "Oh, it's a lovely game, a game of fun and a game of adventure." Et cetera.
<otakon> um no
<otakon> let's see
<JESmith71> So if you guys are playing Worms or something? Do you guys ever play it on that MLP map with Mane 6?
<Muffin0> aw i use vista
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Steam sale makes things worse, too.
<Lunar_Brony> I have XP
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: that was a great story
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not going to get donations when people are buying Steam games.
<Lunar_Brony> nothin' special
<sonicandmario85> i have XP too
<Kammerjunk> Yes.
<Kammerjunk> I still need to read the story.
<otakon> everyone is well meaning here
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The OS on my laptop is XP
<otakon> but we're all broke
<otakon> goddammit
<Reikim> Uru seems to have a lot of worlds that are just there to be pretty. Not that I'm complaining, mind you.
<soul> i looked at D&D wiki, it had draconequus, and one of the suggested male names was discord
<Mutterguy> I'm not saying i won't but i can't until i vist the bank on monday
<Kurra> Being broke has its conveniences.
<Meanwhile> I totally would, but I can't even pay for the steam sales.
<otakon> soul: you are shitting me.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Being broke sucks.
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<xxMoopyxx> hey guys do you know the dudes name of the anto brony?
<Kurra> Broke makes shopping a no-brainer!
<otakon> hiya Everlasting_Joy
<soul> look for yourself
<otakon> xxMoopyxx: sure why not?
<xxMoopyxx> i mean anti
<MahBoi777> HEY Everlasting_Joy!
*Meanwhile dusts Nittany_Discord.
<Mutterguy> soul i'm guessing it's a recent edit
<Bronysith> hi there Everlasting_Joy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Having anxiety issues that prevent you from getting any job makes things worse.
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord I know that feel, bro
<otakon> soul: to the D&D wiki!
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey otakon and Bronysith!
<xxMoopyxx> what was his name
<soul> idk
<Shizuka> 13oh good we're up to cavcon 4
<Everlasting_Joy> MahBoi777, this late night visit is what all true warriors strive FOUR!
<Shizuka> 13must have had a big donation party somewhere
<Muffin0> i think i may have fixed my laptop but it says what its doing can take over an hour
<Lunar_Brony> Anxiety isn't keeping my away from a job
<soul> lol
<Meanwhile> Whatcon who?
<Reikim> Uru
<xxMoopyxx> hmmm
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, it's half past 6 AM. I guess I'm not going to attend archery today.
<xxMoopyxx> well im just in a private chat with therainbowvortex
<Shizuka> 13uru live is run by donations now, and the status is indicated by "cavern condition" or CAVCON, similar to defcon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, I had a bad experience on a painting job. That's hurt me since.
<Muffin0> and it usualy takes 5 days for what it says 1 hour
<MahBoi777> Everlasting_Joy: WOO
<Cypresswolf> O_O I missed the entire movie night - I thought I was just taking a nap - then suddenly 11:30 pm - dozed off about 4
<Meanwhile> Ah, I've only got as far as finishing the pillar ages.
<BaconMane> 0,5Painting isnt fun. TOo monotonous
<Lunar_Brony> ohai BaconMane
<Meanwhile> Oh I see. Well that's cool.
<Shizuka> 13cavcon 5 is they have way more donations than they need to run the servers and are putting it towards new content, cavcon 4 is the next best where they're still way over what they need
*Bronysith glomps BaconMane into a fryer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Anything other than academic jobs make me anxious, so I'm screwed there.
<Shizuka> 13it was at cavcon 2 for a little while which meant they were dipping into reserve funds to keep going
<soul> so either one of the mlp creators is a D&D fan, or one of the D7D wiki editors is a brony
<Shizuka> 13cavcon 1 is the reserve is dead and cancellation is imminent
<Lunar_Brony> soul both?
<soul> im going with the second one
<Meanwhile> But we're at cavcon 4, yes?
<soul> idk though
<pony_165561> .
<Shizuka> 13ja 4 which is good
<Shizuka> 13about where it's been since they started
<Meanwhile> Then überbiscuits.
<Bronysith> i could go for some biscuits
<Bronysith> hot out the oven
<Bronysith> with some sweet honey
<soul> . . .
<sonicandmario85> IF I SAY ITS A FUCKING BACKFLIP IT IS A BACKFLIP
<sonicandmario85> XD
<Cypresswolf> was lotto tonight
<soul> ?
<Shizuka> 13i am so not waiting until 2am to pick up the negilahn donut....
<Lunar_Brony> MUFFINS!!
<Mutterguy> it'd be both. there's a quite reasonable brony community on the giant in the playground forum
<Lunar_Brony> Cypresswolf nnope
<Reikim> Bronysith, get on Uru so I can have someone to complain at when the puzzles get hard.
<Cypresswolf> cool :)
<Lunar_Brony> atlest, I dont' think so
<otakon> soul: neat
<Everlasting_Joy> sonicandmario85: Why do a backfliip when you can do a barrel roll?
<Bronysith> Reikim: i would but i am sleeping right now
<Lunar_Brony> pretty sure there wasn't
<Bronysith> Reikim: this is # 32 at your service
<Bronysith> # 42 is sleeping currently
<soul> i think that pinkie should have been the pegasus, and flutter an earth pony :P
<Sumica> 00,10why do a barrel roll when you can do a 3 axis tumble of death ending in a firey kerbal filled fireball
<Bronysith> the main Bronysith you know is number 42, i am 32 the sleep deprived Bronysith
<sonicandmario85> FRONTFLIP Son:BUT DAD THAT WAS A BACKFLIP Me:DONT FUCKING QUESTION ME!
<Kurra> .....wat :|
<Lunar_Brony> ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE!!
<Major> http://fav.me/d5784d6
<soul> :l
<Muffin0> sonicandmario85 pewdiepie reference?
<Reikim> Really, though, D'ni architecture is stunning. Like what would happen if the elves interbred with the dwarves and the offspring weren't hideous and deformed and retarded and I'm losing focus here.
<sonicandmario85> yes
<sonicandmario85> XD
*Ponies47 Sits on Lunar_Brony 's head
<Shizuka> 13oh reikim is doing the stupid hard age
<MahBoi777> Everlasting_Joy: a good point

<Canadian_Brony> Sumica really? What about that pegasus in the bottom-right corner of the stream?
<Meanwhile> Um...weird phrasing but you know what I meant.
<Xaiden> SuperBrony64: Lol I wish I could get my own OC
<Sumica> 00,10I dont know what you are talking about <_<
<Everlasting_Joy> SuperBrony64: His version, or Wrek's version?

<Shizuka> 13do not know why it is disconnecting you so much
<Reikim> Again, it's probably me >.>
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 I dunno. My parents know I'm a brony because a friend told them when I invited him over for dinner. I could feel my face turn beet red
<soul> so detailed @_@
<sub06905> :D ^
<Reikim> I have to go to sleep anyway, so this is probably a sign from God.
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Intresting. How did they react? 6_9
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ^^ dem friends allright
*sub06905 must aquire more pony swag
<Reikim> Shizuka: Sorry I can't complete the puzzles with you guys :( Night now.
<Ponies47> Crush Kill Destroy Swag
<Vinco> I've never told anyone I'm a brony, simply because it's never come up.
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 my father laughed and my mother asked why I wasn't watching it with my sister. She's 6 and the poor girl has only seen 8 episodes
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ha
<Alpha-Omega> I think my ties are with Luna I favor the night sky over the sunny day. Especailly in the woods. There is no light pollution and you could see all the starts.
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Intresting.
<Alpha-Omega> stars
<sub06905> Ponies47: what do you think ur dad would say?
<DJPON3> what are you drawin?
<Ponies47> Vinco: Tel lem now! Everybody you know now! Tel l your friends your family your dog!
<MahBoi777> what is the speed of dark?
<Ponies47> *Tell Eem
<Canadian_Brony> I showed her "A Canterlot Wedding", though. I think one of her favourite ponies is Cadence now, surpassed by Rarity
<AttacktheAndalite> My family knows I'm a brony, I just didn't tell them that I was a brony. I lol'ed
<xxMoopyxx> *Moopy bonks the chatlist*
<MahBoi777> Lol AttacktheAndalite
<xxMoopyxx> Boink bonk!
<Canadian_Brony> MahBoi777 no such thing. Darkness is the vision when an area we see lacks light
<Vinco> Ponies47: I don't feel the need. I don't hide it, I guess no one has noticed yet.
<soul> :D
<MahBoi777> Canadian_Brony: oh
*SparklyWaffles looks around chat
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> DARKNESS IS THE NATURAL STATE OF ALL THINGS o_____o
<sonicrainboomer259|b> PROVE IT
<MahBoi777> SparklyWaffles!
<AttacktheAndalite> MahBoi777: I wore my ne RD shirt to school the other day and my sis comes up to me and says "Aren't you too old to be watching My Little Pony?" I insta-noped her and went on with my day
<SparklyWaffles> MahBoi777!
<Ponies47> sub06905: IDK. But DJ PON-3 I think he would get the parody. I would think he would just ask me where I got it and who bought it. If he asks what's with the unicorn then I guess I'm gonna have to tell him THE TRUTH!
<Canadian_Brony> hi SparklyWaffles
<SparklyWaffles> Hola Canadian_Brony
*MahBoi777 hugs SparklyWaffles
<hen3ry> Bonus if you used Big Mac's voice, AttacktheAndalite.

<Sumica> 00,10uhhhh huh
<Ninjazz> Not Guile's theme but still awesome.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> -_(\
<AttacktheAndalite> hen3ry: My family is like that because I'm 20 and still watch MLP. I have a 4 year old niece so that's extra justification for me watching!
<Vinco> Ponies47: I hid it at first too. I realized like 7 months ago that it was stupid and I didn't care if people knew.
<AttacktheAndalite> I bought her blind 2 blind bags of RD and TS and like 3 McDonalds' ponies :3
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 same here. Mind you, when my parents knew, I realized there was no point hiding it around school cuz I can just say "I like ponies. Ponies are cool." and put my headphones on.
<xxMoopyxx> Listen ok.......grass grows birds fly sun shines and brotha i hurt people
<sub06905> and yet people are still popping fireworks over here :|
<AttacktheAndalite> I just need to get her a shirt or something and she'll be like her auntie! *sharp inhale and twitch*
<Canadian_Brony> xxMoopyxx I'm getting a t-shirt with that on it as a 4-week-belated birthday present
<Ponies47> sub06905: Might as well if he asks. I know he wouldn't dis own me but he might be a little upset. But I think a day at Six Flags would make him forget about it. But how much you wanna bet I'm gonna be getting a few of these /)*(\ while I'm there :P
<hen3ry> Hey, it's Bastille day today... well, it is in Europe, not quite on the West Coast yet.
<xxMoopyxx> Oh that
<Ponies47> Vinco: Good :3
<sub06905> Ponies47: i would guess youll get 5 /) at six flags
<hen3ry> Gotta love a national anthem that talks about the unpure blood of your enemies watering your fields.
<Canadian_Brony> hen3ry that brings me back to Social Studies 9. Wasn't the Batille a prison that was burned down during the French Revolution?
<hen3ry> Canadian_Brony: aye

<Ninjazz|Away> Everytime I see this image, I expect the anthem to play. o_o
<Canadian_Brony> Ninjazz|Away stating a noun as a reason is redundant. Your objection is obsolete. Your logic is unclear. You are a silly filly. CONFUZZLED YET?!?
<killerpony7733> Alpha-Omega: Maybe you got a grown on immunity to alot of feeling things
<mishia> hen3ry she gave accurate oppions? ah at least she got that down. Makes it worth the insult.
<Ninjazz|Away> Canadian_Brony, silly filly is best logic and reason. :3

<Pudgeotto> there was nothing funny about ted
<Canadian_Brony> You want something un-funny?
<xles> To Ted's credit, Tara Strong did voice the voicebox in his tummy...
<Canadian_Brony> read my original fan-fic
<Pudgeotto> xles: are you sure?
<xles> Pudgeotto: Yes.
<xles> Pudgeotto: That or Tara Strong lies.
<Pudgeotto> why would she voice for seth macfarlane?
<Pudgeotto> xles: Tara has been known to troll us bronies on twitter
<Aps|Excited> Nothing is more powerful than a young boys wish... except an apache helicopter... those things have machine guns and missiles
<Canadian_Brony> Pudgeotto Tara Strong is best troll
<Pudgeotto> agreed
<xles> Pudgeotto: Well true, but she tends to brag about what parts she gets.
<Pudgeotto> If I'm gonna be trolled by someone, I want it to be Tara <3
<Ponies47> Tara is gonna be at Cantorlot Gardens and I might be going to Cantorlot Gardens! ^^

<Ninjazz> I'm scurred.
<hen3ry> there's a reason she was the inspiration for Kill Bill.
<Ponies47> Shizuka: You mean *Looks around* (Whisper) the ban hammer?
<Pudgeotto> Shizuka you're scaring everypony
<Shizuka> 13ban hammers are for the weaker classes
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka "Silently end"? I don't like the sound of that. Would you like a muffin?
<Ponies47> Shizuka: O.O
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I end people loudly, to instill fear in the populous
<Vinco> http://tinyurl.com/7z8uekw
<hen3ry> I'm not scared. But I used to date people I casually refered to as evil... and who smiled at that description.
<Canadian_Brony> kirzstryfe atleast everypony will know I'm gone. Would you like a muffin?
<Shizuka> 13see i'm more subtle, people see someone do a forbidden thing then poof, they are gone
*Ponies47 Backs away from Shizuka and kirzstryfe looking very scared

<killerpony7733> hen3ry: Never seen a mod kick or ban or anything like that for lulz
<Ponies47> *sometimes
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Sure :)
<Pudgeotto> I'm used to mods abusing power
<Pudgeotto> i've been a member of some chats that went to hell
<Canadian_Brony> I ain't scared. It's not like a ban will end my life.
<Canadian_Brony> Cuz that would suck.
<panda> Uh....
<Canadian_Brony> I like my life.
<Pudgeotto> Canadian_Brony: but then you know that shizuka hates you, and that feel sbad
*hen3ry sets mode +ded wait, is that even a mode?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ev'rypony has a darkerside, ev'rypony has a bit of... Discord to there heart...
<killerpony7733> Pudgeotto: Put it this way if a mod here abuses power, Instant demod and ban i think

<Canadian_Brony> Pudgeotto there are 15 people at my school who would prefer me dead and over 50 on the internet. One other isn't going to make that much of a difference.

<killerpony7733> Ponies47: I classify myself as a fan of the show and do not use the name brony to give name to it tbh
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka reminds me of me. Takes a lot to piss me off, though
<hen3ry> pyro just wants to spread love. Very, very hot love.
<panda> ^
<panda> XD
<Ponies47> killerpony7733: I see.
<Pudgeotto> killerpony7733: brony is what Tara Strong calls you
<Ninjazz> Shizuschlafen, dat panda drawing. And night~

<KiwiBoi777> gnight Shizuschlafen
<hen3ry> nada
<Vinco> Great soundtrack
<Pudgeotto> night Shizuschlafen!
<Pudgeotto> Use a different screen cap program?
<killerpony7733> Ponies47: Simply put i am by any stretch a brony, I just don't call myself brony. Instead i call myself a fan of the show
<Canadian_Brony> "Shizuka" doesn't register a ping now, right?
<Phase4> 00,02ACS13123, if you know of another i'm hapy to try it
<Ponies47> killerpony7733: Meh. I just call myself a brony
<ACS13123> Phase4: What you mean?
<Canadian_Brony> killerpony7733 I know what you mean by that
<Phase4> 00,02well theres vhscreencap
<killerpony7733> Ponies47: Again your choice just like calling myself a fan and not brony
<Pudgeotto> camstudio?
<Phase4> 00,02vhmulticap witch is the same thing but not free
<Pudgeotto> doesnt that do sreen cap?
<killerpony7733> Canadian_Brony: Some people kinda have a hard time grasping that, :D
<ACS13123> Phase4: I cant seem to record things that take up the full screen either... try putting it in a seperate window o3o
<Pudgeotto> screen*
<Phase4> 00,02Pudgeotto, and while that does cap, it wont output to fmle
<Pudgeotto> oh
<Ponies47> killerpony7733: Right. You call yourself what you want and I call myself what I want
<Phase4> 00,02i cant window mirrors edge
<Pudgeotto> darn
<ACS13123> Cant you?
<Pudgeotto> I thought you could
<killerpony7733> Ponies47: Indeed :)
<Phase4> 00,02there is a way
<Phase4> 00,02but it would be amazingly hard
<Pudgeotto> try right clicking on the Mirros edge shortcut and putting in a windowed parameter
<hen3ry> There is always a way. And it is usually hard to do.
<Ponies47> killerpony7733: :)
<ACS13123> Option>Video>Show in> Open in window o-o
<Phase4> 00,02Pudgeotto, already tried
<Pudgeotto> aw :(
<panda> Dat Phase4 ^-^
<Phase4> 00,02ACS13123, i have no clue what you meen but the options dont have a windowed thing
<ACS13123> Phase4: TF2 and all that does... :/
<Phase4> 00,02tf2 runs on the source engine
<ACS13123> thats a good point...
<Phase4> 00,02source > this engine
<Phase4> 00,02which is heavily modified unreal engine iirc
<ACS13123> welp
<ACS13123> I dunno
<Pudgeotto> what other games do you have?
<Deceptive_Cadence> Everything uses either Source or Unreal 3 these days
<Canadian_Brony> hi Deceptive_Cadence
<ACS13123> suddenly BURST of text
<ACS13123> on a different channel...
<ACS13123> :P
<Deceptive_Cadence> Or Havok
<Deceptive_Cadence> Quite a few things use Havok
<killerpony7733> Phase4: If things simply won't work you could do kerbals or or L4D2
<Pudgeotto> dide
<Pudgeotto> dude
<ACS13123> Phase4: you could just play and we listen to the sound :/
<Pudgeotto> you have so many games
<Ninjazz> Isn't Havok just a physics engine?
